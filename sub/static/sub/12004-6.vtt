00:01.780 --> 00:04.620
You're entitled to recovery for
being denied the opportunity

00:04.620 --> 00:06.760
- to raise your real daughter.
- I don't want anyone thinking

00:06.760 --> 00:09.730
it's okay what happened to us,
especially not that hospital.

00:09.930 --> 00:11.940
- I play a little poker.
- Oh, I play poker.

00:11.940 --> 00:14.090
Deaf people pick up people's tells.

00:14.290 --> 00:15.350
Seriously?

00:16.400 --> 00:18.270
You're the one who kept telling me to bet.

00:18.270 --> 00:19.510
'Cause I thought he was bluffing.

00:19.510 --> 00:21.230
Do you even know how much I lost tonight?

00:21.700 --> 00:25.210
- Who's my father?
- Best thing that man ever did was leave.

00:25.240 --> 00:26.570
There's something I want you to have.

00:26.830 --> 00:27.972
Your dad took it.

00:28.839 --> 00:30.115
That's you in there.

01:04.660 --> 01:05.620
PARKING PASS

01:06.740 --> 01:07.880
Uh, come in.

01:10.360 --> 01:12.780
I saved you some dinner. Daphne made it.

01:12.780 --> 01:14.340
Is it vegetarian?

01:14.340 --> 01:17.210
Yes, but it's actually really good.

01:17.210 --> 01:20.410
Take a break. Try some.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.390
- What was this called again?
- Pastichio.

01:30.420 --> 01:33.360
It's a Greek lasagna,
but instead of lamb, I used tofu.

01:33.390 --> 01:34.430
It actually is good.

01:34.860 --> 01:38.060
Did you learn to make this at your school?

01:38.090 --> 01:40.350
No, Carlton only offers home ec.

01:40.350 --> 01:41.923
You know, Buckner Hall offer...

01:42.960 --> 01:44.480
Buckner what?

01:44.480 --> 01:48.800
I was just thinking about the advanced
cooking classes that Buckner has.

01:48.840 --> 01:52.170
- No, thank you.
- Not for you. For Daphne.

01:55.880 --> 01:58.880
Would you mind if Daphne
took a class at your school?

01:59.890 --> 02:01.920
I guess not.

02:01.950 --> 02:05.740
They're really great.
They're taught by local chefs.

02:05.740 --> 02:07.700
I think I could arrange for you to take one

02:07.700 --> 02:09.130
if you're interested.

02:09.130 --> 02:10.880
Yeah, yes.

02:12.310 --> 02:14.120
But are you sure you're okay with this?

02:16.040 --> 02:18.070
We already basically live in the same house.

02:18.100 --> 02:21.070
If I can't handle seeing you
at my school for an hour a day,

02:21.110 --> 02:23.010
I've got bigger problems.

02:26.840 --> 02:28.030
Hey, remember when I let you

02:28.030 --> 02:30.020
borrow money for those ostrich
feather paint brushes?

02:30.050 --> 02:31.220
Ostrich eyelash?

02:31.250 --> 02:32.950
- Whatever.
- And I paid you back.

02:32.990 --> 02:34.030
It's my turn. I need a loan.

02:34.030 --> 02:35.220
What for? Another amp?

02:35.220 --> 02:38.650
- That's irrelevant.
- I'm saving up for spring break.

02:38.650 --> 02:40.100
Piggy bank's on lockdown. Sorry.

02:40.130 --> 02:42.130
- I'll pay you back.
- That's not the point.

02:42.170 --> 02:44.270
- It's just 200 bucks.
- Hey!

02:45.380 --> 02:46.330
You owe me.

02:47.480 --> 02:49.670
Okay, fine.

02:53.210 --> 02:54.540
Thank you.

03:14.580 --> 03:15.930
We don't have any of the right stuff.

03:16.130 --> 03:17.980
Maybe I should go check Kathryn's kitchen.

03:19.450 --> 03:23.330
It's Buckner Hall. I am sure they
have measuring spoons in class.

03:23.400 --> 03:27.250
And they probably have
your name engraved on the handle.

03:28.250 --> 03:29.950
Okay, relax.

03:29.950 --> 03:32.790
- I just wanna be prepared.
- You're gonna do fine.

03:32.790 --> 03:34.520
The interpreter will meet you in class.

03:34.520 --> 03:35.700
You got me an interpreter?

03:35.700 --> 03:38.270
The Principal already lent
somebody up when I called.

03:38.270 --> 03:41.140
No, I don't want one.
It's like having a stalker.

03:41.140 --> 03:44.230
Sweetie, you remember what it was like
when you went to a hearing school?

03:44.290 --> 03:47.190
I was eight. I can read lips now,
I will be fine.

03:47.190 --> 03:49.490
If I can make it through
a Kennish family dinner,

03:49.490 --> 03:51.680
I can make it through a cooking class.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.100
Yeah, fair enough.
Even I can't make through those.

03:58.720 --> 04:02.330
Okay, so the library is right there.

04:02.370 --> 04:04.970
And the swimming pool
and gym are should be left.

04:05.650 --> 04:09.120
I still can't get over it.
This place is like a resort.

04:09.410 --> 04:11.900
Yeah, our Latin motto actually means

04:11.900 --> 04:13.420
the haves and the have mores.

04:14.140 --> 04:16.529
Hey, has Toby tried to
borrow money from you?

04:16.750 --> 04:19.880
No, he barely talks to me
since the whole poker fiasco.

04:20.860 --> 04:22.840
He sold all his amps and his mountain bike

04:22.840 --> 04:25.110
and he still seems really desperate.

04:25.110 --> 04:26.620
He's lost money before, right?

04:26.620 --> 04:27.940
He's always come out okay.

04:28.320 --> 04:31.140
Yeah. So here we are.

04:31.140 --> 04:32.890
The lab kitchen's right through there.

04:37.910 --> 04:39.940
You're gonna do fine here.

04:40.390 --> 04:40.970
I am, right?

04:40.970 --> 04:43.440
Just stay away my guys I dated,
I'll make you a list.

04:50.620 --> 04:51.420
Wait, is this all of it?

04:51.420 --> 04:53.160
It's $4,000. I'm working on the rest.

04:53.730 --> 04:55.530
Come on, you're putting
me in a tight spot here.

04:55.530 --> 04:57.380
You know I'm good for it.
I just need a little more time.

04:57.380 --> 05:00.680
I don't have time.
I made a bet on ** Dame last week

05:00.680 --> 05:02.820
- and lost my shirt.
- Dude, you've got a problem.

05:02.820 --> 05:05.120
Says the guy who owes me 10 grand.

05:05.970 --> 05:08.200
My point is I am in the hole,

05:08.200 --> 05:11.310
and Hinckley is not as understanding
with me as I am with you.

05:11.310 --> 05:14.100
- What's he gonna do?
- I don't wanna find out.

05:18.210 --> 05:20.320
What about the other thing?

05:20.980 --> 05:22.160
You know, the...

05:22.630 --> 05:25.580
- Are you sure you're up for it?
- Yeah.

05:25.580 --> 05:28.940
You sure? You cannot say yes
and then wuss out on me.

05:29.940 --> 05:31.160
Yeah, I'm up for it.

05:32.260 --> 05:33.300
How do I get in?

05:33.300 --> 05:35.090
Leave that to me. I'll get back to you.

05:43.620 --> 05:45.930
Nice. Oh, yeah.

05:47.170 --> 05:50.220
So I saw the article on you in "The herald."

05:50.220 --> 05:53.700
Sounds like things are working
out with the whole new situation.

05:54.500 --> 05:56.650
Dale, I know you're a member
of the hospital board.

05:56.650 --> 05:58.540
We probably shouldn't be talking about this.

05:58.690 --> 06:00.930
It's okay. About to get settled, right?

06:01.050 --> 06:02.020
Yeah, we'll see.

06:03.100 --> 06:04.720
Pretty good offer from what I hear.

06:05.050 --> 06:07.970
Actually, it's less than
a quarter of our demand.

06:07.970 --> 06:09.600
I don't have to tell you
what we're up against...

06:09.600 --> 06:11.210
budget cuts, soaring costs.

06:11.210 --> 06:13.970
I don't have to tell you what
my family's been up against.

06:13.970 --> 06:15.960
And everybody admires
the way you're handling it.

06:15.960 --> 06:18.390
But the hospital is part of this community.

06:19.090 --> 06:20.560
You really wanna be
the guy who puts it under

06:20.560 --> 06:22.920
because you feel you're
entitled to a huge payday?

06:26.700 --> 06:28.280
That is so out of line.

06:28.280 --> 06:30.090
I'm speaking to you as a friend.

06:30.690 --> 06:32.170
You break the hospital, next thing you know

06:32.200 --> 06:34.000
your line of credit dries up at the bank

06:34.040 --> 06:35.290
and then your dealerships take

06:35.290 --> 06:36.850
their contracts to some
other car wash chain.

06:36.850 --> 06:39.190
And then what are you left
with besides your settlement?

06:40.880 --> 06:41.710
Is that a threat?

06:41.750 --> 06:43.170
It's a reality check.

06:43.170 --> 06:45.040
Hospital doesn't have
what you're asking for.

06:46.620 --> 06:49.100
Come on, John, it was human error.

06:49.100 --> 06:49.880
We need to do better.

06:49.880 --> 06:52.440
And we will. We have.

06:52.670 --> 06:54.330
But let's get this thing over with,

06:54.330 --> 06:55.850
settle and move on.

06:56.490 --> 06:58.000
For everybody's sake.

07:04.700 --> 07:07.860
Now anyone can dazzle
with a flavorful cassoulet

07:07.860 --> 07:10.830
or a slow cooked osso buco.

07:10.830 --> 07:12.650
But the test of a true chef is

07:12.650 --> 07:14.780
what they do with simple fare.

07:14.780 --> 07:17.680
So today we're going to be
making burgers and fries.

07:18.250 --> 07:19.620
Piece of cake.

07:20.130 --> 07:22.750
Now the secret to a good burger

07:22.930 --> 07:24.800
is the thickness of the patty.

07:25.420 --> 07:26.610
What's the secret?

07:27.460 --> 07:29.700
Let's just say size matters.

07:29.700 --> 07:32.010
So garlic cloves, bread crumbs,

07:32.010 --> 07:34.330
bacon, all make nice fillers.

07:35.320 --> 07:39.110
- Yes?
- How do you feel about black bean veggie burgers?

07:39.110 --> 07:40.280
Flappy wedgie burgers?

07:40.280 --> 07:43.340
- No, black bean.
- What?

07:46.680 --> 07:47.630
Never mind.

07:58.350 --> 08:00.980
Emmett. Oh, uh...

08:04.520 --> 08:06.970
Are you waiting for Daphne?

08:09.960 --> 08:11.230
Can I look?

08:21.100 --> 08:22.420
You're an artist.

08:35.909 --> 08:37.559
Yeah, that's me,

08:37.559 --> 08:40.250
but Regina doesn't know I have it.

08:40.250 --> 08:41.460
So...

08:47.050 --> 08:50.300
It's my dad's, whoever that is.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.200
You see the parking
sticker in the windshield?

08:54.200 --> 08:56.690
I thought it might tell me
where he lived or worked.

09:00.580 --> 09:03.150
Yeah, I tried. I tried blowing it up,

09:03.150 --> 09:04.350
but it just got all blurry.

09:04.390 --> 09:05.620
You don't know how

09:05.650 --> 09:08.490
to enlarge the image and, like, sharpen it,

09:08.520 --> 09:11.220
do you? You do?

09:11.520 --> 09:13.460
If I sent you a JPEG,

09:13.590 --> 09:15.000
could you do that for me?

09:16.360 --> 09:17.340
Thank you.

09:22.540 --> 09:24.410
And now while your fries are cooking,

09:24.410 --> 09:26.530
whip up your aioli sauce.

09:27.430 --> 09:29.800
- Could you pass me the lemons?
- Yes.

09:32.140 --> 09:35.080
When the bell rings, remove the fries,

09:35.080 --> 09:37.640
shake off the grease and let them cool.

09:38.620 --> 09:40.880
Wow, you really are good at this stuff.

09:42.780 --> 09:44.100
Why are you taking this class?

09:44.320 --> 09:45.070
I need an easy "A,"

09:45.070 --> 09:46.560
and I'm not getting into Duke

09:46.590 --> 09:48.660
with B's and C's, even with lacrosse.

09:48.700 --> 09:50.700
Don't be shy with the garlic.

09:50.730 --> 09:53.330
More garlic means more flavor.

09:55.940 --> 09:58.250
- Could you get me another egg?
- Oh, yes.

10:05.710 --> 10:06.700
Mr. Wilke,

10:07.160 --> 10:09.300
do you intend to let your
partner do all the work?

10:09.580 --> 10:12.450
I never let my partners do all the work.

10:12.490 --> 10:14.490
Tell me about the last meal you cooked.

10:14.520 --> 10:18.390
I cooked toaster strudel
this morning for breakfast.

10:18.430 --> 10:20.560
A meal which included more ingredients.

10:22.430 --> 10:24.600
Crushed peanut butter.
Does crushed peanut butter count?

10:24.630 --> 10:25.780
- No.
- No?

10:25.930 --> 10:29.450
Hey, new girl.

10:29.850 --> 10:31.650
The bell means your fries are done.

10:32.350 --> 10:34.810
Oh, no no no no!

10:52.400 --> 10:54.490
I'm so sorry about the fire.

10:54.850 --> 10:57.380
It was an accident, honey.
No one's blaming you.

10:57.380 --> 11:00.690
Of course not, but for liability purposes,

11:00.720 --> 11:03.190
we are going to have to require
that you have an interpreter

11:03.190 --> 11:05.140
with you on school grounds from now on.

11:05.410 --> 11:07.830
What? No, I don't want an interpreter.

11:07.860 --> 11:10.120
I will focus more next time.

11:10.120 --> 11:13.580
I promise nothing like this
will ever... ever happen again.

11:14.600 --> 11:16.990
- Please.
- Is that really necessary, Mr. Thatcher?

11:16.990 --> 11:18.540
I'm afraid so.

11:20.410 --> 11:23.680
Well, maybe we could try
an interpreter for a while.

11:23.680 --> 11:24.630
And if things go well...

11:24.630 --> 11:26.940
Daphne, I know this can be difficult.

11:27.130 --> 11:29.360
My granddaughter has a deaf friend,

11:29.550 --> 11:31.450
but she has a cochlear implant.

11:32.220 --> 11:33.790
Have you ever considered that?

11:34.460 --> 11:36.200
It's worked wonders for her.

11:41.830 --> 11:43.790
I'm already the deaf girl
who set the kitchen on fire.

11:43.790 --> 11:46.580
Now I have to be the deaf
girl with the weird sidekick.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.010
I'm sorry.

11:49.250 --> 11:52.570
So have you ever thought
of a cochlear implant?

11:53.230 --> 11:54.130
No.

11:55.980 --> 11:58.750
It's just... I've read a little about it.

11:59.100 --> 12:01.950
And I know it's not
the same as regular hearing,

12:03.050 --> 12:05.110
but you can have a conversation

12:05.110 --> 12:08.250
on the phone or listen to music

12:08.780 --> 12:10.470
or laughter.

12:12.530 --> 12:14.930
I'm just not getting it,

12:15.240 --> 12:17.210
why it's so terrible.

12:20.290 --> 12:21.530
That's the bell.

12:22.370 --> 12:24.170
I'm sorry again about the fire.

12:25.120 --> 12:26.900
It's okay. It's okay.

12:37.720 --> 12:39.100
What are you doing here?

12:43.890 --> 12:45.720
No way. You were able to
read the parking sticker?

12:47.860 --> 12:50.050
The address where my dad's car is.

12:50.050 --> 12:52.010
How did you get this?

12:53.100 --> 12:54.600
Oh, the license plate number.

12:55.430 --> 12:57.530
I guess that's more useful
than the parking sticker.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.030
I've had that picture for weeks

12:59.030 --> 13:01.530
and I never once thought of doing that.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.630
You're a genius.

13:04.490 --> 13:06.520
How do you say "Thank you" in sign language?

13:08.760 --> 13:09.850
Thank you.

13:10.560 --> 13:13.300
So this is where the car was last year.

13:14.930 --> 13:16.190
Maybe it's still there.

13:16.190 --> 13:19.000
And maybe if we find the car,
we can trace the ownership

13:19.000 --> 13:20.640
all the way back to my dad.

13:23.830 --> 13:25.040
Oh, you wanna go there now.

13:28.830 --> 13:30.820
What the hell? Here.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.350
Hey, morning, sunshine.

13:47.650 --> 13:48.640
I got it.

13:49.420 --> 13:51.640
This is my interpreter Sam.

13:51.790 --> 13:53.130
Hi.

13:53.130 --> 13:57.390
Hey, by any chance, could you
burn down my history classroom?

13:57.560 --> 13:58.910
There's a paper I didn't write.

13:59.840 --> 14:00.570
Not funny.

14:00.830 --> 14:02.680
Come on, I'm kidding.

14:02.700 --> 14:04.310
Well, actually, I didn't do that paper.

14:06.640 --> 14:08.030
Can you believe her?

14:10.680 --> 14:12.270
Hey, something I could help you with?

14:12.510 --> 14:13.490
No, well, then get back to

14:13.490 --> 14:15.570
your frittata, Clover.

14:18.280 --> 14:20.860
The girl's named after a flower.
What do you expect?

14:21.920 --> 14:23.000
Thanks.

14:23.280 --> 14:26.370
Listen, what are you doing after class?

14:26.370 --> 14:29.470
You wanna get out of here?
Maybe steal a school bus,

14:29.470 --> 14:31.280
follow Bruno Mars on tour?

14:32.040 --> 14:35.330
But do we have to bring along
the human subtitle machine?

14:35.700 --> 14:36.640
No offense, bro.

14:36.800 --> 14:38.300
I mean, I'm all for a threesome,

14:38.300 --> 14:41.240
but I'd rather be outnumbered
than outgunned, do you know?

14:41.640 --> 14:45.230
Today, we'll be making gazpacho,

14:45.610 --> 14:47.040
which requires

14:47.040 --> 14:50.390
no heating whatsoever.

14:52.410 --> 14:56.680
So someone from each row should come up

14:56.720 --> 15:00.040
and get a box of ingredients.

15:00.040 --> 15:01.060
I'll be right back.

15:01.060 --> 15:04.080
Each group will need a large bowl

15:04.080 --> 15:06.120
and a knife...

15:06.120 --> 15:07.670
This is what happens when

15:07.670 --> 15:09.600
you force special needs charity cases...

15:25.850 --> 15:26.970
Dale really said that?

15:26.970 --> 15:29.570
He doesn't strike me as
the type to make threats.

15:29.570 --> 15:30.930
It's a scare tactic.

15:31.560 --> 15:34.750
Hospital board obviously thinks
I'm some kind of a spineless wimp

15:34.750 --> 15:37.530
who's gonna fold as soon
as they flash their sword.

15:38.530 --> 15:41.280
What if he's right about
people retaliating against us?

15:41.280 --> 15:42.790
Let 'em try.

15:42.790 --> 15:44.550
- Honey.
- I'm serious.

15:44.550 --> 15:45.980
Let them try.

15:46.200 --> 15:48.450
This is about what happened to us.

15:48.660 --> 15:51.290
The only way that hospital
is ever gonna change

15:51.290 --> 15:54.160
is if it costs them, and it costs them big.

15:54.900 --> 15:57.080
That's the way these things work. Trust me.

16:14.730 --> 16:15.530
No way.

16:18.840 --> 16:20.120
Great.

16:22.780 --> 16:25.970
What for? We'll never find the car in there.

16:26.130 --> 16:28.650
And even if we do, it won't do us any good.

16:32.650 --> 16:33.840
I hope that's sign language

16:33.840 --> 16:36.060
for "Because there's a wizard in there"

16:36.060 --> 16:38.320
"who will make all your dreams come true."

16:56.540 --> 16:58.850
Look, there. I think
that's the license plate.

17:28.560 --> 17:29.750
There's nothing here.

17:42.530 --> 17:43.880
I don't know what I was thinking.

17:45.800 --> 17:47.500
That we drive up to my dad's house

17:47.530 --> 17:48.860
and he'd throw open his arms and be like,

17:48.860 --> 17:49.430
"There you are."

17:49.430 --> 17:51.820
"I've been waiting for you for 16 years."

17:54.750 --> 17:55.830
I'm sorry.

18:00.640 --> 18:01.900
You know what's amazing?

18:02.650 --> 18:06.070
You are the best listener I know.

18:29.910 --> 18:31.170
What the hell are you thinking?

18:31.380 --> 18:32.530
Why don't you watch where you're going?

18:33.710 --> 18:34.960
Are you okay, Daphne?

18:35.320 --> 18:36.870
Are you okay?

18:48.420 --> 18:50.680
I gotta say, Kathryn was right.

18:51.020 --> 18:53.950
These Mission Hills
ladies are great tippers.

18:54.350 --> 18:56.510
The days of pan dulce and geraniums

18:56.510 --> 18:59.420
instead of cash are over!

19:01.030 --> 19:02.590
Why didn't you get me the cochlear?

19:03.920 --> 19:04.970
What?

19:05.300 --> 19:06.870
Did you consider it for me?

19:07.370 --> 19:09.000
Of course.

19:09.280 --> 19:13.140
I mean, before I met Melody and Emmett

19:13.180 --> 19:14.410
and learned better.

19:14.450 --> 19:15.830
Do you think it's too late for me?

19:15.830 --> 19:18.380
I mean, I know it works better

19:18.380 --> 19:20.030
if you get it when you're little.

19:20.270 --> 19:24.020
Well, that's true, but it's not impossible.

19:25.070 --> 19:27.810
If you want it, we can look into it.

19:29.330 --> 19:31.190
Did something happen today?

19:33.160 --> 19:34.550
I almost got run over.

19:34.820 --> 19:37.330
What? Honey, you have to be careful.

19:37.330 --> 19:39.680
I know. I usually am.

19:41.310 --> 19:44.970
And I accidentally started
a fire in cooking class

19:44.970 --> 19:47.140
because I couldn't hear the bell.

19:47.650 --> 19:50.380
'Cause they don't have timers with lights.

19:51.420 --> 19:54.030
Next time, you just bring your own.

19:55.100 --> 19:58.310
I can't always bring
my own deaf stuff everywhere.

19:58.310 --> 19:59.530
Of course you can.

19:59.790 --> 20:02.280
You compensate.

20:02.280 --> 20:04.310
You work twice as hard, like you always do.

20:04.320 --> 20:07.910
What if I don't wanna work
twice as hard and compensate?

20:07.920 --> 20:09.510
What if I just want

20:09.520 --> 20:12.500
to have it a little easier,
be more like everyone else?

20:13.880 --> 20:14.980
Too bad,

20:15.820 --> 20:17.870
because you never will be.

20:19.980 --> 20:21.300
Who brought it up?

20:22.600 --> 20:23.600
John?

20:23.990 --> 20:25.110
Kathryn?

20:26.160 --> 20:27.830
She was just asking.

20:27.840 --> 20:29.670
It's okay. She's allowed to ask.

20:29.680 --> 20:33.080
She's just curious. All hearing
people are curious about it.

20:33.090 --> 20:36.480
You are part of an amazing community.

20:36.480 --> 20:39.060
You have your own language and history.

20:39.440 --> 20:42.570
You get a cochlear and
suddenly you're nowhere.

20:42.580 --> 20:44.280
You're not deaf, not hearing.

20:44.290 --> 20:46.190
I know, I know, and I don't need

20:46.200 --> 20:48.820
the deaf pride speech right now.

20:51.120 --> 20:52.900
You want me to talk to them?

20:53.110 --> 20:55.310
No. Please, no.

21:06.290 --> 21:08.000
I guess someone played guitar.

21:20.900 --> 21:22.340
Whoa, whoa, dude. Slow down.

21:22.350 --> 21:24.000
You might as well be speaking Russian.

21:26.850 --> 21:29.030
Daphne, you,

21:29.290 --> 21:30.940
were short.

21:32.130 --> 21:35.010
Daphne and you were kids. You were kids.

21:37.770 --> 21:40.050
You found a guitar.

21:40.050 --> 21:41.430
You opened a guitar case.

21:41.920 --> 21:45.190
You saw... you didn't see a guitar.

21:45.200 --> 21:46.170
This is the most rocking

21:46.180 --> 21:48.310
game of charades ever. Sorry. Keep going.

21:50.170 --> 21:51.550
Someone walked in.

21:52.800 --> 21:55.430
R... my R. Regina.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.000
Regina walked in and saw you guys

21:57.010 --> 21:59.660
and freaked out.

21:59.820 --> 22:01.120
Then what happened?

22:02.050 --> 22:05.720
What? No, come on.
You don't know anything else?

22:05.730 --> 22:07.430
You can't guess or something?

22:07.440 --> 22:09.990
Come on, more information. More.

22:13.670 --> 22:16.230
She took the guitar case away.

22:18.910 --> 22:23.690
Okay, so maybe the guitar case

22:23.710 --> 22:26.920
is my dad's and maybe the stuff inside

22:26.930 --> 22:28.400
could help me find him.

22:29.760 --> 22:33.780
You can drive and open things.

22:33.790 --> 22:36.320
Garage, your garage.

22:37.520 --> 22:39.050
Okay, Regina,

22:39.580 --> 22:41.610
she left boxes.

22:41.620 --> 22:43.900
Boxes, she has boxes in your garage.

22:43.910 --> 22:45.750
Maybe the guitar case is there.

22:45.760 --> 22:46.750
Could we go look now?

22:48.630 --> 22:51.310
Tomorrow? It's a date.

22:56.040 --> 22:58.640
But you have to wait till it's
dark and everybody's gone home.

22:58.650 --> 23:00.610
Really? I thought broad
daylight might be better.

23:00.620 --> 23:02.270
Hey, listen to me. I'm serious.

23:02.280 --> 23:04.110
You can't screw this up, all right?

23:06.610 --> 23:09.850
Now this will get you into
the south entrance of the school.

23:09.950 --> 23:12.850
He stays logged on so you don't
need a password or anything.

23:13.030 --> 23:14.210
Where'd you get this?

23:14.490 --> 23:15.460
Money talks,

23:15.470 --> 23:16.930
especially to an overworked janitor

23:16.940 --> 23:18.880
who thinks we're all
a bunch of spoiled brats.

23:18.940 --> 23:20.060
Well, we kind of are.

23:20.060 --> 23:21.620
I mean, we're stealing tests.

23:21.630 --> 23:24.550
Shh! Just scan it in

23:24.560 --> 23:26.660
and I'll get it to our customers.

23:27.290 --> 23:28.580
How much are you charging?

23:28.590 --> 23:30.460
- $1,000.
- $1,000?

23:30.460 --> 23:33.430
Listen, don't underestimate
how lazy these dumb-asses are.

23:33.440 --> 23:35.580
They'd rather pay than study.

23:35.580 --> 23:37.160
Lucky for us, I guess.

23:37.170 --> 23:39.130
Hey, are you wussing out on me?

23:39.490 --> 23:42.550
Listen, Hinckley is going
to put my ass in a sling

23:42.560 --> 23:43.760
if I don't pay.

23:44.300 --> 23:45.720
I'm not wussing out.

23:45.730 --> 23:47.640
If you had my 10 grand,
you wouldn't have to do this,

23:47.650 --> 23:48.730
but you don't.

24:04.210 --> 24:05.150
Come in.

24:08.740 --> 24:11.360
I have to stuff 500 envelopes by tomorrow.

24:11.370 --> 24:14.430
God knows why I volunteer for
these things all the time.

24:15.490 --> 24:17.660
I was gonna make up some
reason for being here.

24:17.730 --> 24:20.640
I thought about light bulbs or trash bags.

24:21.200 --> 24:22.470
You're welcome to both.

24:23.070 --> 24:25.010
I promised Daphne I wouldn't say anything.

24:25.020 --> 24:27.150
This is about the cochlear conversation?

24:27.190 --> 24:30.630
She never wanted one before.
Now suddenly with you two...

24:30.850 --> 24:33.800
I just think it's worth
a family conversation

24:33.810 --> 24:35.940
about the pros and the cons.

24:35.950 --> 24:39.080
Do you know that they have to cut
open her brain to install it?

24:39.460 --> 24:41.130
Do you know that it's permanent?

24:41.140 --> 24:44.490
They can't remove it and the
long-term risks are unknown.

24:44.500 --> 24:47.220
Hold on, hold on I was
just asking a question like

24:47.230 --> 24:48.400
I would about any treatment.

24:48.410 --> 24:51.490
It's not a treatment. She's not sick.

24:53.330 --> 24:55.970
I just... I don't understand

24:55.990 --> 24:57.140
why you didn't get it for

24:57.150 --> 24:58.980
her when she was little. She was a baby.

24:58.990 --> 25:01.410
She couldn't ask for it. You're her mother.

25:01.790 --> 25:04.260
What kind of a mother doesn't
want her child to hear?

25:04.270 --> 25:05.340
You are not getting it.

25:05.350 --> 25:06.960
Tell me, what am I not getting?

25:06.970 --> 25:09.100
Daphne is the one doing all the work here.

25:09.290 --> 25:13.450
She speaks your language.
She reads your lips.

25:13.460 --> 25:15.750
You've made no effort to meet her halfway.

25:15.760 --> 25:17.820
And now you wanna have
her surgically altered

25:17.830 --> 25:18.910
to make sure you never have to.

25:18.920 --> 25:20.780
I just want what's best for her.

25:20.790 --> 25:23.910
Then stop asking her to change.

25:26.710 --> 25:30.680
Use these. The sooner
you learn her language,

25:30.690 --> 25:33.660
the sooner you will get to
know the incredible person

25:33.950 --> 25:36.050
that you gave birth to.

25:51.050 --> 25:52.940
Don't you still need those?

25:53.370 --> 25:54.300
No.

25:55.070 --> 25:56.830
I think I'm done with that class.

26:00.100 --> 26:01.090
What happened?

26:01.100 --> 26:03.900
Wilke make one too many jokes
about braising your loins?

26:05.090 --> 26:06.740
You didn't hear about the deaf girl

26:06.750 --> 26:09.440
who almost got run over in
the student parking lot?

26:09.570 --> 26:11.350
No, are you okay?

26:11.360 --> 26:13.380
Or the fire I almost started in cooking

26:13.390 --> 26:14.810
'cause I couldn't hear the bell?

26:14.920 --> 26:15.810
No.

26:16.770 --> 26:18.660
Guess you're not essential
to Buckner Hall gossip

26:18.660 --> 26:19.930
as you thought.

26:20.430 --> 26:22.280
Really? No one told you?

26:23.500 --> 26:26.040
Last week, my friend
Cavon stapled his finger

26:26.050 --> 26:27.290
to his Spanish test.

26:27.300 --> 26:30.160
Jenna Gluchinski wet herself in band

26:30.170 --> 26:31.210
because the director wouldn't

26:31.220 --> 26:33.150
let her go pee before
the halftime performance.

26:33.160 --> 26:35.330
Oh, and some idiot almost
electrocuted himself

26:35.330 --> 26:36.790
in shop class.

26:36.800 --> 26:38.390
Okay, okay. You can stop.

26:39.870 --> 26:40.990
Thanks.

26:42.610 --> 26:45.680
Besides, you never struck
me as the kind of person

26:45.690 --> 26:49.060
who cared what people thought of you.

26:52.340 --> 26:55.150
Truth is I don't really
have the best memories

26:55.160 --> 26:56.830
of going to a hearing school.

26:57.530 --> 27:00.070
And I think all this is
just bringing it back.

27:00.080 --> 27:01.330
What happened?

27:03.120 --> 27:03.950
Let's just say

27:04.130 --> 27:06.360
third grade girls can be pretty horrible.

27:10.880 --> 27:12.380
they called me "Retarded".

27:13.410 --> 27:16.430
I never got a single birthday
invitation or Valentine.

27:16.440 --> 27:19.770
I ate lunch alone every single day.

27:23.360 --> 27:25.030
It might sound silly now,

27:25.030 --> 27:26.410
but when you're eight...

27:26.520 --> 27:28.250
It doesn't sound silly.

27:29.590 --> 27:32.470
I used to beg my mom not to make me go back.

27:32.780 --> 27:34.960
And then one day

27:34.970 --> 27:37.290
just as the girls were
starting in on me again,

27:38.030 --> 27:40.520
Emmett walked by on
the way home from his school.

27:41.010 --> 27:42.480
Eight-year-old Emmett.

27:43.010 --> 27:45.860
He ran up to them and he started to scream

27:46.200 --> 27:49.460
and he just kept screaming
right in their face.

27:50.910 --> 27:53.300
If you've never heard
a deaf person scream before,

27:53.850 --> 27:56.780
it's pretty scary, so I've been told.

27:57.260 --> 27:58.950
The girls were terrified.

27:58.960 --> 28:02.870
It was like the world just frozed.

28:05.600 --> 28:08.440
And then he stopped and said...

28:09.550 --> 28:12.430
the only time I've ever known him to speak...

28:13.960 --> 28:18.150
He said, "Don't you ever talk to her again."

28:21.860 --> 28:24.090
Then he grabbed my hand and took me away.

28:25.800 --> 28:27.990
Took me to his house to Melody,

28:28.940 --> 28:34.110
and he explained what
happened using his hands.

28:37.310 --> 28:39.840
I had never seen sign language before.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.350
It was...

28:44.690 --> 28:45.920
incredible.

28:49.490 --> 28:53.140
She gave me a big hug and
marched me back to my house,

28:53.150 --> 28:56.110
and sat my mom down and set her straight.

28:56.760 --> 28:58.570
Told her about deaf schools.

28:58.600 --> 29:00.610
Said we both had to learn how to sign.

29:01.430 --> 29:03.230
Everything changed after that.

29:09.760 --> 29:12.430
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

29:12.910 --> 29:14.210
Do you need to go?

29:14.620 --> 29:15.600
Yeah.

29:16.070 --> 29:17.780
It's okay, go.

29:26.330 --> 29:27.670
I just have to say,

29:29.040 --> 29:30.870
if you can survive all that,

29:31.390 --> 29:33.950
Buckner really shouldn't
be that big of a deal.

29:35.890 --> 29:37.230
I hope you stay.

29:39.740 --> 29:40.740
Thanks.

29:57.670 --> 29:59.380
Hey, bud. Dinner ready?

30:00.170 --> 30:01.420
I think so.

30:03.920 --> 30:05.750
But you're not here about dinner.

30:07.500 --> 30:08.550
What's up?

30:11.410 --> 30:13.360
I got into some trouble

30:13.370 --> 30:16.390
and I need some help.

30:19.370 --> 30:21.050
What kind of trouble?

30:21.520 --> 30:22.760
What kind of help?

30:23.890 --> 30:26.820
Hopefully the kind that doesn't
involve you yelling at me.

30:26.980 --> 30:28.830
Does it involve a girl?

30:29.170 --> 30:30.230
No.

30:33.100 --> 30:36.250
- Is it money?
- Yes.

30:36.260 --> 30:37.430
Poker?

30:38.480 --> 30:40.860
Toby, we've been here before.

30:42.360 --> 30:44.490
I'm all for you and your sister having fun

30:44.500 --> 30:46.400
as long as it doesn't get out of control.

30:46.410 --> 30:48.820
Your mom and I cannot keep
bailing you out every...

30:48.830 --> 30:50.170
Look at me, son.

30:50.850 --> 30:54.090
Cannot keep bailing you out
every time you go too far.

30:54.370 --> 30:57.670
You have to start taking
responsibility for your own mistakes.

30:59.230 --> 31:00.730
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

31:03.030 --> 31:05.390
What kind of damage are
we talking about here?

31:06.050 --> 31:07.830
$500, $1,000?

31:11.630 --> 31:12.860
$2,000.

31:14.950 --> 31:18.390
$3,000? Please tell me we're not
talking about more than $3,000.

31:18.400 --> 31:19.620
No, we're not.

31:20.790 --> 31:22.310
You know what, dad? You're right.

31:22.500 --> 31:26.190
I should take care of this on my own.

31:31.540 --> 31:34.270
I've always found that's
the best way to learn a lesson.

31:35.590 --> 31:37.140
John, dinner!

31:37.890 --> 31:39.550
Okay, be right there.

31:47.091 --> 31:48.091
Hi.

32:00.110 --> 32:01.470
Ready?

32:07.620 --> 32:09.950
Toby's washing up. Where's Bay?

32:10.170 --> 32:11.610
She's at Simone's.

32:12.520 --> 32:15.500
Honey, you remember when
Toby got bit by that dog?

32:15.690 --> 32:17.100
Yeah, sure do.

32:17.950 --> 32:20.640
That E.R. doctor was amazing.

32:20.930 --> 32:23.290
Toby was hysterical. We were hysterical.

32:23.300 --> 32:25.490
And she somehow managed to calm us all down.

32:25.530 --> 32:26.700
She sure did.

32:27.510 --> 32:30.430
Honey, you know,
I'd hate for her not to be there

32:30.440 --> 32:33.460
if we or somebody else needed her.

32:34.250 --> 32:37.730
Sweetie, they have malpractice insurance.

32:38.150 --> 32:39.280
I know.

32:40.660 --> 32:41.740
What if it's not enough?

32:41.750 --> 32:43.190
What if they have to make up for the rest

32:43.200 --> 32:46.700
by cutting off grants or laying off doctors?

32:46.710 --> 32:48.860
- It's not gonna happen.
- How can you be so sure?

32:48.870 --> 32:50.780
I just want them to say I'm sorry.

32:53.050 --> 32:54.040
What?

32:54.800 --> 32:56.940
Yeah, that's it.

32:57.180 --> 32:59.140
No more crap about how
these things just happen.

32:59.150 --> 33:00.460
No more pointing fingers at us.

33:00.470 --> 33:01.900
No more minimizing what we've been through.

33:01.910 --> 33:04.530
I just want a damn apology.

33:06.320 --> 33:07.270
Sweetie.

33:07.280 --> 33:08.240
And guess what?

33:08.240 --> 33:09.290
That is never gonna happen.

33:09.300 --> 33:10.480
You know why? It is always

33:10.490 --> 33:12.270
going to be a condition of the settlement

33:12.310 --> 33:14.930
No apology, no admission of guilt.

33:16.020 --> 33:18.090
So what are you gonna do?

33:18.380 --> 33:20.430
I don't wanna bankrupt any hospital,

33:20.440 --> 33:23.060
so take the settlement.

33:25.170 --> 33:26.370
That's great.

33:27.420 --> 33:30.520
It's not just because of
what Dale said, is it?

33:31.170 --> 33:32.960
I'm not afraid of Dale.

33:34.250 --> 33:36.180
Now you've been talking
about this for a long time,

33:36.190 --> 33:37.920
and I hear you.

33:39.040 --> 33:40.170
We make our point,

33:40.180 --> 33:41.750
and we move on with our lives.

33:43.090 --> 33:44.500
I love you.

34:08.190 --> 34:10.500
You don't make a very scary pirate.

34:11.380 --> 34:12.320
No.

34:17.310 --> 34:21.770
I don't think the guitar case is in here.

34:22.440 --> 34:24.250
We would have found it by now.

34:26.940 --> 34:30.090
What's that? Looks official.

34:44.219 --> 34:45.840
"Love songs for Regina."

34:46.510 --> 34:48.659
"So the baby knows good music."

34:48.670 --> 34:50.679
"All my love, A.S."

34:52.150 --> 34:53.969
Maybe that's my dad.

34:53.980 --> 34:57.450
"A," so Adam or Aaron, Andrew.

34:57.790 --> 35:00.350
Anakin Skywalker.

35:00.730 --> 35:02.080
Or whoever that is.

35:03.650 --> 35:06.370
Okay, let's see what else is in here.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
It's Daphne's birth certificate.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.390
I mean, my birth certificate.

35:19.920 --> 35:23.000
"October 22nd, 1:22 A.M.,"

35:23.010 --> 35:24.030
"6.5 pounds."

35:24.040 --> 35:25.870
"Mother... Regina Vasquez.

35:26.210 --> 35:29.090
"Father... Angelo Sorrento."

35:31.150 --> 35:33.030
That's him. That's my dad.

35:33.080 --> 35:35.810
Angelo Sorrento. Angelo Sorrento's my dad.

35:35.820 --> 35:37.540
I'm Angelo Sorrento's daughter.

36:07.900 --> 36:09.470
Way to go, dad.

37:14.640 --> 37:17.100
To say sorry for almost
burning down your classroom.

37:18.570 --> 37:20.650
They are chocolate mousse patty **.

37:26.660 --> 37:28.850
Oh my god, it's delicious.

37:29.340 --> 37:30.720
I know what she said.

37:30.730 --> 37:32.230
It's what everyone says.

37:33.620 --> 37:35.210
I took the advanced class so
I can learn something new.

37:35.220 --> 37:37.040
But I can't

37:37.040 --> 37:38.410
if you change the way you teach it.

37:38.830 --> 37:40.170
So don't slow down for me

37:40.170 --> 37:42.270
because I'm a better cook
than everybody in this class.

37:42.490 --> 37:43.790
You got it.

37:45.470 --> 37:48.120
Whenever I need you, I'll let you know.

37:48.520 --> 37:50.400
If you see something burning, tell me.

37:50.410 --> 37:52.670
But other than that, I will be okay.

37:52.960 --> 37:54.670
- Okay?
- Okay.

38:03.450 --> 38:05.160
Oh my God. These are delicious.

38:08.640 --> 38:09.710
I'd offer you one,

38:09.710 --> 38:11.330
but you might catch being deaf.

38:28.730 --> 38:29.700
What is it?

38:29.710 --> 38:31.780
I just got a phone with our lawyer.

38:31.880 --> 38:35.640
Oh good. You told her
we take her number, right?

38:35.650 --> 38:36.890
It's done?

38:36.900 --> 38:38.930
The hospital just withdrew their offer.

38:39.340 --> 38:41.630
What do you mean withdrew it?

38:42.070 --> 38:44.370
I mean they don't wanna settle anymore.

38:44.675 --> 38:46.138
They want to go to trial.

38:46.455 --> 38:48.297
In front of a judging jury.
Why would they do that?

38:48.297 --> 38:50.330
She said they were open to no shot.

38:51.160 --> 38:52.870
She thinks they found something.

38:53.660 --> 38:56.060
Something that they can use against us.

38:57.480 --> 38:59.050
Like what?

39:00.590 --> 39:02.020
I have no idea.

39:13.690 --> 39:14.960
Something's up.

39:14.970 --> 39:16.100
What are you talking about?

39:16.230 --> 39:18.430
Listen, did you tell
anybody about the thing?

39:18.440 --> 39:19.770
What? Of course not.

39:19.780 --> 39:21.000
Did they know? What happened?

39:21.010 --> 39:22.750
Just chill out.

39:22.760 --> 39:25.450
Mr. Bensknam asked me to
stay out of class today.

39:25.480 --> 39:27.100
It's probably for something else, right?

39:27.110 --> 39:29.460
I don't know.

39:29.470 --> 39:30.900
But your ass is on
the line as much as mine is.

39:30.910 --> 39:33.450
Just relax. Play cool.

39:33.460 --> 39:35.692
You were at home reading
your Bible or whatever.

39:35.692 --> 39:37.231
You don't know anything, right?

39:37.649 --> 39:38.694
Hey boys.

39:39.259 --> 39:41.595
Plotting a takeover of the school of the damned.

39:43.118 --> 39:44.118
Yeah.

39:48.210 --> 39:50.582
Wow. Wilkie speachless, that's a first.

39:53.416 --> 39:54.452
What did he say Toby?

39:54.870 --> 39:56.084
Nothing. I've got class.

40:05.733 --> 40:06.733
Hi.

40:07.660 --> 40:08.660
Hi.

40:12.085 --> 40:13.085
You wanna come in?

40:19.360 --> 40:20.360
You're...

40:20.437 --> 40:21.817
You're right.

40:22.969 --> 40:23.969
I...

40:23.969 --> 40:24.969
I want...

40:25.439 --> 40:26.689
I want to learn.

40:29.506 --> 40:32.181
- I was... I was trying to say.
- I know what you said.

40:32.972 --> 40:34.957
It's probably terrible,
I learned on the internet.

40:37.647 --> 40:38.647
Oh.

40:43.091 --> 40:44.091
It's beautiful.

40:44.998 --> 40:46.503
Just... beautiful.

40:47.978 --> 40:50.462
You don't realize how much
everything you do affects her.

40:51.824 --> 40:52.824
This is gonna...

40:54.753 --> 40:55.851
This is everything.

40:57.829 --> 40:58.829
Thank you.

41:00.856 --> 41:01.856
Thank you.

41:04.859 --> 41:05.859
Thank you.
