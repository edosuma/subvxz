I may seem a trifle nervous,

but let me tell you why.

15:09.400 --> 15:11.567
You see,

15:11.567 --> 15:15.033
I used to fight...a lot.

15:15.033 --> 15:16.100
I have to admit,

15:16.100 --> 15:18.167
I was pretty handy
with my dukes too,

15:18.167 --> 15:19.934
and I fought for the right,

15:19.934 --> 15:24.801
but then, when I was 10...

15:24.801 --> 15:27.400
this guy and I got into it.

15:27.400 --> 15:29.501
We were rockin'.

15:29.501 --> 15:32.968
I had a short fuse back then,
like now.

15:32.968 --> 15:37.734
I thrashed him within an inch
of his 8-year-old life.

15:37.734 --> 15:39.200
Didn't like the feeling.

15:39.200 --> 15:40.534
Right then,

15:40.534 --> 15:45.133
I vowed I would never
use my hands in anger again.

15:45.133 --> 15:47.934
That day, I went home
and hung up my fists for good.

Oh, Steve,

15:50.300 --> 15:52.734

It's not the kind of thing
I'm proud of, Marcie.

15:55.400 --> 15:57.300
Then you must
stand by your vow.

15:57.300 --> 15:59.801

in a fight.

like a dog.

a little story.

Is it about what you did
upstairs?

No. You'll learn about that
soon enough.

"There's a man
that's not afraid of anything."

16:54.868 --> 16:56.567
It's not true, Steve.

16:56.567 --> 16:58.067
I was afraid once.

16:58.067 --> 17:00.601
When I was just a kid,
there was this beast.

17:00.601 --> 17:03.467
It was the scariest thing
you've ever seen.

17:03.467 --> 17:05.767
We both wanted Peg,

is not only blind,

17:08.067 --> 17:09.567

Every time Peg and I went out,
it was there.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.534
Every time I saw it,
I'd run like hell,

17:16.534 --> 17:17.934
but I knew that one day

17:17.934 --> 17:20.233
we'd have to settle this thing
once and for all.

17:20.233 --> 17:22.467
So one day,
I get sick of running.

17:22.467 --> 17:25.467
So one day in the schoolyard,
we went at it.

can't say that I won,

17:42.901 --> 17:44.934
I was never afraid again.
