I designed the machine

00:16.030 --> 00:19.165
violent crimes
involving ordinary people.

00:19.167 --> 00:21.901
The government considers
these people irrelevant.

05:20.159 --> 05:21.791
There's nothing to talk about.

I've already spent more time
on that than I should.

05:23.629 --> 05:25.061

make the puzzle, who did?

- Thanks, Alek.
- Yeah.

08:18.832 --> 08:21.699
Finch, Alek is Anna's trainer.

08:21.701 --> 08:24.668
And now we know
how she got that bruise.

08:24.670 --> 08:27.872
She's not a victim of abuse.
She's doling it out.

08:27.874 --> 08:29.373
<i>She's an MMA fighter.</i>

08:29.375 --> 08:32.042
Which means she may be

Turns out Anna won honors

09:45.839 --> 09:48.874
in both judo and kick-boxing
in college.

09:48.876 --> 09:50.275
Must be taking it

09:51.912 --> 09:53.811
<i>She may find it more</i>
<i>difficult than she thinks.</i>

09:53.813 --> 09:57.114

10:01.988 --> 10:04.989
Any threat against Anna

After I solved
the last Nautilus puzzle,

12:24.693 --> 12:27.994
I was taken in by this group.

12:27.996 --> 12:30.296
They told me the game's purpose
was to recruit people

12:30.298 --> 12:31.697
who could help them
on their mission.

12:31.699 --> 12:33.933
Which is...

Soon I was hacking databases,

You hacked the group,
didn't you?

12:53.655 --> 12:55.922
Turns out...

12:57.991 --> 12:59.491
every mission I did for them

12:59.493 --> 13:01.460
led directly
to someone's death.

13:01.462 --> 13:04.996
And not bad people.
Ordinary people.

13:04.998 --> 13:08.500
One man, a software designer,

13:08.502 --> 13:12.337
had just returned from holding
his newborn granddaughter

13:12.339 --> 13:14.273
in his arms.

13:17.409 --> 13:20.745
They slipped poison
into his coffee at the hospital.

13:22.682 --> 13:25.116
His names was Charles Wynn...

13:27.987 --> 13:30.822
and I'll never let myself
forget it.

13:30.824 --> 13:32.423
That's when you chose
to escape.

13:32.425 --> 13:34.092
Yes.

13:34.094 --> 13:35.726
To find you,

13:35.728 --> 13:38.229
a man whose name
I didn't even know,

13:38.231 --> 13:40.364
the one person
who tried to keep me

13:40.366 --> 13:42.600
from going down the wrong path.

13:45.404 --> 13:48.105
If only I knew
what the right path is.

13:53.812 --> 13:55.779
- My nose!
- Give me back my game!

13:55.781 --> 13:57.447
Look, I don't care
who took whose copy

13:57.449 --> 13:59.083
of <i>Full Metal Hellcat 4.</i>

13:59.085 --> 14:00.784
You may be warriors online,

14:00.786 --> 14:03.721
but you can't go and hit
each other in the real world.

14:03.723 --> 14:05.755
Now, you, clinic.
You, incident report.

14:05.757 --> 14:08.191
Let's go.

14:08.193 --> 14:10.293
[phone buzzes]

14:12.363 --> 14:14.030
A text from Jill. _

14:17.831 --> 14:19.863
_

14:23.040 --> 14:25.574
Looks like Anna's avoiding her sister. _

14:37.720 --> 14:40.156
Excuse me.
What happened to Naresh?

14:40.158 --> 14:43.425
No idea-- His stuff was gone
this morning when I came in.

14:43.427 --> 14:44.926
<i>Anna?</i>

14:44.928 --> 14:47.095
Ms. Buchanan apparently
wants to see you.

14:51.434 --> 14:54.269
<i>(Anna) - Ms. Buchanan?</i>
<i>- Have a seat, Anna.</i>

14:54.271 --> 14:56.437
Let's talk
about this user problem

14:56.439 --> 14:57.673
you've been looking into,

14:57.675 --> 15:00.275
uh, the one
about Paul Zimmerman.

15:00.277 --> 15:02.010
Yes. I'm so relieved.

15:02.012 --> 15:04.279
I was hoping someone at the top
would see the red flag.

15:04.281 --> 15:05.847
I'm told you tried to contact
this user

15:05.849 --> 15:09.350
about search requests
he made using VAL.

15:09.352 --> 15:10.885
<i>That's right, I did.</i>

15:10.887 --> 15:12.320
<i>Are you aware</i>
<i>of our privacy policy here?</i>

15:12.322 --> 15:14.155
Yes, but this was--

15:14.157 --> 15:16.090
A lawsuit waiting to happen.

15:16.092 --> 15:17.925
Drop it.

15:17.927 --> 15:19.827
Or we're gonna have to have
a serious conversation

15:19.829 --> 15:21.762
about your future here.

15:21.764 --> 15:24.532
Maybe you should
get back to work.

15:29.921 --> 15:32.469
_

15:34.375 --> 15:36.143
<i>(Anna)</i>
<i>Excuse me.</i>

15:38.479 --> 15:42.083
Software's up to date.
You're welcome.

15:54.895 --> 15:56.863
Thanks.

15:56.865 --> 15:58.965
You're welcome.

15:58.967 --> 16:01.500
Although, when you hear
what I have to tell you,

16:01.502 --> 16:04.303
you may wish that
that was something stronger.

16:09.877 --> 16:12.411
Those people that took you in,

16:12.413 --> 16:15.381
they're not making the world
a better place.

16:15.383 --> 16:19.118
They're remaking the world
in the image of their leader.

16:21.321 --> 16:24.990
So who's their leader?

16:24.992 --> 16:27.660
A being...

16:27.662 --> 16:29.762
that is willing to kill
as many people as it takes

16:29.764 --> 16:33.365
to keep its own existence secret
and its power intact,

16:33.367 --> 16:36.568
like your software engineer,
Charles Wynn.

16:36.570 --> 16:39.071
It seems that he was
a contract employee

16:39.073 --> 16:40.906
of a company called Decima

16:40.908 --> 16:45.043
shortly before they brought
this leader online.

16:45.045 --> 16:46.812
Online.

16:49.715 --> 16:50.948
I don't understand.

16:50.950 --> 16:54.085
It's an AI...

16:54.087 --> 16:56.354
and it's called Samaritan.

17:07.565 --> 17:08.699
What's that?

17:08.701 --> 17:11.367
Two minutes ago, I had no idea.

17:11.369 --> 17:13.104
When I found out
about all those people

17:13.106 --> 17:15.239
who died because of me,
I took one last thing

17:15.241 --> 17:17.741
from the group's network--

17:17.742 --> 17:21.078
a raw chunk of source code
from a set of old drives.

17:21.079 --> 17:24.714
Whatever was on it
was labeled...

17:24.717 --> 17:26.569
"Samaritan."

17:31.122 --> 17:33.256
You disabled that, didn't you?

17:33.258 --> 17:34.458
How?

17:34.460 --> 17:36.293
I looped the camera system.

17:36.295 --> 17:37.594
I knew it.

17:37.596 --> 17:40.496
You're a hacker...
like me.

17:40.498 --> 17:42.732
Which means you're the one
who can help me do

17:42.734 --> 17:44.301
what needs to be done.

17:44.303 --> 17:47.003
Together,
with this source code,

17:47.005 --> 17:50.307
you and I
can attack Samaritan...

17:50.309 --> 17:51.908
and kill it.

18:04.988 --> 18:07.457
Let go of me!
[grunting]

18:07.459 --> 18:09.559
Pretty sure the lady
doesn't want a ride!

18:15.932 --> 18:18.033
Let's get out of here!

18:18.035 --> 18:19.268
Hey--

18:21.304 --> 18:22.771
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

18:22.773 --> 18:25.741
Remember me?
Come on.

18:27.710 --> 18:29.210
Security guard from work?

18:29.212 --> 18:32.881
I'm a cop.

18:32.883 --> 18:34.649
From the looks of it,
you need my help.

18:48.628 --> 18:51.362
You have no idea who those men
were who attacked you?

18:51.364 --> 18:52.463
No.

18:52.465 --> 18:53.698
Look, I still don't get

18:53.700 --> 18:56.467
why a Homicide detective
is following me.

18:57.635 --> 18:58.802
Unless...

18:58.804 --> 19:01.038
is this about Paul Zimmerman?

19:01.040 --> 19:02.639
Who?

19:02.641 --> 19:05.175
A few days ago, I was listening

19:05.177 --> 19:07.077
to users' questions
to the VAL system,

19:07.079 --> 19:08.745
transcribing them,

19:08.747 --> 19:11.581
and one user's voice
kept coming up.

19:11.583 --> 19:13.917
(Zimmerman) How can I get
help for depression?

19:13.919 --> 19:15.886
I need the number
of a suicide hotline.

19:15.888 --> 19:17.721
But Zimmerman can't be
the only one

19:17.723 --> 19:19.523
to make an online search
like that.

19:19.525 --> 19:20.824
Of course not.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.926
And when they do,
this is what happens.

19:22.928 --> 19:27.230
VAL, I need the number
for a suicide hotline.

19:27.232 --> 19:31.367
(VAL) Here's what
I was able to retrieve. _

19:31.369 --> 19:33.236
Now look at what VAL
sent Zimmerman

19:33.238 --> 19:35.538
when he asked
the same question.

19:35.540 --> 19:38.241
"Five painless ways
to end one's life.

19:38.243 --> 19:40.276
How to make sure
others are taken care of

19:40.278 --> 19:41.677
after you're gone."

19:41.679 --> 19:44.180
Zimmerman was a man
on the edge.

19:44.182 --> 19:46.115
VAL essentially
nudged him over.

19:46.117 --> 19:48.517
I sent an email
up the chain, but...

19:48.519 --> 19:50.052
nothing happened.

19:50.054 --> 19:53.589
So... I got my friend
Naresh to help.

19:53.591 --> 19:55.357
He dug up Zimmerman's number,

19:55.359 --> 19:57.192
and I reached out to him.

19:57.194 --> 19:59.028
Turns out I was too late.

19:59.030 --> 20:01.196
Zimmerman killed himself
the night before.

20:01.198 --> 20:04.266
So Zimmerman's dead,
VAL helped it happen,

20:04.268 --> 20:05.534
and now they're after you.

20:05.536 --> 20:07.536
Maybe not just me.

20:07.538 --> 20:09.538
My friend Naresh
didn't show up to work today.

20:09.540 --> 20:13.075
I don't know if he quit
or got fired.

20:13.077 --> 20:14.109
Or worse.

20:14.111 --> 20:16.478
<i>I'll go check on Naresh.</i>

20:16.480 --> 20:18.813
You stay here where it's safe.

20:18.815 --> 20:21.382
Fusco will keep an eye on you.

20:21.384 --> 20:22.750
You bet.

20:22.752 --> 20:25.720
(Reese)
Just one more thing.

20:25.722 --> 20:28.155
Why risk your job
for a stranger like Zimmerman?

20:31.326 --> 20:34.161
A few months back...

20:34.163 --> 20:35.930
someone close to me--

20:35.932 --> 20:38.499
someone ill--

20:38.501 --> 20:41.335
asked the same questions
Zimmerman did.

20:43.905 --> 20:46.673
If she'd asked VAL

20:46.675 --> 20:48.942
instead of me...

21:05.640 --> 21:07.076
_

21:10.764 --> 21:12.132
[phone rings]

21:16.504 --> 21:18.538
Let me guess--
you need something,

21:18.540 --> 21:20.440
and it's a matter
of some urgency.

21:20.442 --> 21:22.041
<i>It's no wonder</i>
<i>you're a detective.</i>

21:22.043 --> 21:23.443
Could you possibly
look up death records

21:23.445 --> 21:24.977
for a particular body?

21:24.979 --> 21:27.312
Think I can manage that.
You got a name?

21:27.314 --> 21:28.347
<i>I do.</i>

21:28.349 --> 21:31.283
Charles Wynn.

21:37.057 --> 21:39.625
Have you had a chance
to look at the flash drive?

21:39.627 --> 21:40.960
No, not yet.

21:42.495 --> 21:46.532
Well, what are you waiting for?

21:46.534 --> 21:48.867
Lie back for a minute.

21:48.869 --> 21:50.802
I need to check your wound.

21:50.804 --> 21:51.836
Come on.

21:54.140 --> 21:56.141
Keep thinking
about Charles Wynn,

21:56.143 --> 21:57.909
the man who was poisoned
at the hospital

21:57.911 --> 21:59.644
by that group of yours.

21:59.646 --> 22:02.180
What hospital was it?

22:02.182 --> 22:04.315
- New York General.
- Big place.

22:04.317 --> 22:05.917
Easy to see how someone

22:05.919 --> 22:08.252
could secretly administer
a lethal dose of...

22:08.254 --> 22:10.321
what did you say?

22:10.323 --> 22:12.490
I didn't, actually.

22:12.492 --> 22:14.059
Aconitine.

22:14.061 --> 22:16.894
Aconitine. Unusual choice
for an assassination.

22:16.896 --> 22:19.063
Tends to stay
in the bloodstream.

22:19.065 --> 22:21.799
Is this some kind
of interrogation?

22:23.502 --> 22:25.269
Just gathering facts.

22:25.271 --> 22:27.171
Stick that flash drive
in your laptop,

22:27.173 --> 22:29.740
and you'll see
I'm telling the truth.

22:29.742 --> 22:33.577
Perhaps. Perhaps.

22:33.579 --> 22:35.245
Or perhaps the moment I do so,

22:35.247 --> 22:37.547
a program in that drive
will seek out every device

22:37.549 --> 22:40.884
my laptop's been connected to,
everyone that's close to me,

22:40.886 --> 22:43.520
and Samaritan will use that
information to hunt them down,

22:43.522 --> 22:46.256
which may have been
your intention all along.

22:46.258 --> 22:47.557
A few hours ago,

22:47.559 --> 22:51.261
you were opening my eyes
to Samaritan.

22:51.263 --> 22:53.330
Now you're saying
I work for it?

22:55.766 --> 22:58.801
I called a friend of mine
at the NYPD.

22:58.803 --> 23:00.270
The only Charles Wynn

23:00.272 --> 23:02.539
that died in the Tri-State Area
this year

23:02.541 --> 23:03.940
did so in a car accident--

23:03.942 --> 23:05.875
no trace of aconitine
in his blood.

23:08.378 --> 23:10.812
Keep your flash drive, Claire.

23:10.814 --> 23:12.715
On my way out,
I'll reactivate the cameras.

23:12.717 --> 23:14.383
You can tell your story
to Samaritan.

23:14.385 --> 23:18.587
You once said that you
didn't believe I was a killer...

23:18.589 --> 23:20.522
that I valued life too much.

23:22.759 --> 23:25.794
Well, I believe that about you.

23:25.796 --> 23:29.330
You wouldn't just leave me here
for dead.

23:33.335 --> 23:36.671
That may have been true once,

23:36.673 --> 23:38.940
but that was
before I lost someone,

23:38.942 --> 23:41.643
someone dear.

23:41.645 --> 23:45.647
She's gone now, and I won't risk
losing anyone else.

23:45.649 --> 23:47.348
Good-bye, Claire.

23:48.917 --> 23:51.252
Charles Wynn died
of a myocardial infarction

23:51.254 --> 23:53.888
caused by 9 milligrams
of aconitine.

23:53.890 --> 23:55.856
<i>He struck an oncoming car,</i>

23:55.858 --> 23:57.925
<i>hospitalizing</i>
<i>the couple inside,</i>

23:57.927 --> 24:01.361
and somehow sparing the
six-year-old in the backseat.

24:03.598 --> 24:06.466
All of which you know...

24:06.468 --> 24:09.103
if your friend
read you the report.

24:10.205 --> 24:14.441
I don't have to read it.

24:14.443 --> 24:17.844
I know every...
painful detail.

24:17.846 --> 24:20.113
<i>And as for Wynn's blood,</i>

24:20.115 --> 24:22.982
<i>aconitine only shows up</i>
<i>if you're looking for it.</i>

24:22.984 --> 24:25.652
With Wynn's history
of heart trouble,

24:25.654 --> 24:27.721
they weren't looking.

24:27.723 --> 24:33.626
Now, I am sorry
that you lost your friend,

24:33.628 --> 24:35.862
but if you leave now...

24:35.864 --> 24:39.866
when you are dead wrong...

24:39.868 --> 24:42.401
you're gonna lose me too.

25:07.360 --> 25:08.493
[phone rings]

25:10.196 --> 25:12.231

25:12.233 --> 25:13.832
She must be crashing hard.

25:13.834 --> 25:16.768
EMTs are on the way.
I have to go.

25:16.770 --> 25:19.271
Okay, but I'm taking you
myself.

25:28.614 --> 25:31.683
Moving on up,
eh, Mr. Prasad?

25:31.685 --> 25:33.251
VP of data access

25:33.253 --> 25:35.019
and a whole new office
to prove it.

25:35.021 --> 25:37.355
Yeah, all happened
kind of fast.

25:37.357 --> 25:39.590
I know Anna Mueller
will be relieved.

25:39.592 --> 25:41.259
She thought you got fired.

25:41.261 --> 25:44.128
Something about that...
Zimmerman issue?

25:44.130 --> 25:45.696
Just a mainframe
processing glitch.

25:45.698 --> 25:47.131
The second I pointed it out

25:47.133 --> 25:48.399
to the higher-ups,
they were on it.

25:48.401 --> 25:50.634
- Then they promoted you?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

25:50.636 --> 25:52.236

The last few months,

30:47.392 --> 30:49.992
she's been so sick,

30:49.994 --> 30:51.994
and I've never felt
more helpless.

30:54.097 --> 30:56.832
So...

30:56.834 --> 31:00.269
I started getting up early,
coming home late.

31:00.271 --> 31:01.870
Taking on amateur fights.

31:01.872 --> 31:03.872

31:11.015 --> 31:15.750
<i>So why do I</i>
<i>still feel so helpless?</i>

31:15.752 --> 31:19.921
The thing
about fighting someone...

31:19.923 --> 31:21.856
questions are simple.

31:21.858 --> 31:26.027
Either you're beating them,
or they're beating you.

31:26.029 --> 31:27.629
But it's the harder fights,

31:27.631 --> 31:30.532
the ones outside the ring,

31:30.534 --> 31:32.634
that actually mean something.

31:35.137 --> 31:37.805
Everything else is wasted time.

31:37.807 --> 31:41.542
I don't want to waste
any more time.

<i>make their depression worse.</i>

32:00.128 --> 32:01.829
But that makes no sense.

32:01.831 --> 32:04.431
I thought so too until I looked
at the other targets.

32:04.433 --> 32:07.167
People in debt,

to track down its source.

Ms. Buchanan,

At least one person is dead,

32:48.475 --> 32:50.709
and my friend Anna's
being hunted down.

32:50.711 --> 32:52.878
I'm sorry, but this all seems
a little hard to believe.

32:52.880 --> 32:54.947
- Are you sure?
- Come on, Naresh.

32:54.949 --> 32:56.982

should be up in 60 seconds.

Let's go.

33:23.310 --> 33:25.209
Once we're outside,

33:25.211 --> 33:27.045
we'll need to stick
to the areas

33:27.047 --> 33:29.047
with no video surveillance.

33:29.049 --> 33:32.316
Luckily, I have a map.

33:55.874 --> 33:59.409

I almost beat myself.

33:59.411 --> 34:02.012
One slip, and it could
have cost me the game.

34:02.014 --> 34:03.713
I'll take your phone

34:03.715 --> 34:05.548

You're a fool if you think

34:16.460 --> 34:19.027
I'll lead you back

peacefully.

34:27.405 --> 34:28.904
Go where?

34:28.906 --> 34:33.409
We've been talking
so much about Samaritan.

34:33.411 --> 34:36.978

saw what it looks like.

34:49.303 --> 34:51.270
Sorry to keep you
in the dark, Lauren,

34:51.272 --> 34:53.106
but when I found
my new algorithm for VAL,

34:53.108 --> 34:54.806
I knew I had to go it alone.

34:54.809 --> 34:57.877
Because you knew
I'd never allow such a thing.

34:57.879 --> 34:58.978
It's your loss.

34:58.980 --> 35:01.413
The beta test
was nearly flawless.

35:01.415 --> 35:03.216
Soon, VAL will shape
the emotions

35:03.218 --> 35:06.418
of millions of users,
and Fetch & Retrieve

35:06.420 --> 35:08.053

of the most powerful advertising

35:08.055 --> 35:10.088
and content delivery platforms
in the world.

35:10.090 --> 35:11.257

commit suicide

35:11.259 --> 35:12.725

35:12.727 --> 35:15.661
I feel awful about what happened
to Paul Zimmerman.

But he was
the unfortunate consequence

35:17.097 --> 35:19.298

so hard to build.

Calvin, you can't just kill
innocent people.

38:25.613 --> 38:27.346
If the world needs to be saved,

38:27.348 --> 38:29.982
then perhaps this is
the most efficient way to do it.

38:29.984 --> 38:32.617
I still have one question.

38:32.619 --> 38:34.286
Samaritan is willing
to shoot you

38:34.288 --> 38:37.156
to get me to believe
what it wanted.

38:37.158 --> 38:40.559
How far will it go to get
these children to believe?

38:45.432 --> 38:47.365
Take him.

39:03.182 --> 39:04.782
[gunshots]

39:08.687 --> 39:11.856
Nice to finally
meet you, Claire.

39:11.858 --> 39:14.459
Give your boss
a message for me.

39:14.461 --> 39:16.527
Hi.

39:16.529 --> 39:17.828
[groans]

39:19.898 --> 39:20.898
Come on, Harry.

39:20.900 --> 39:22.600
Gotta let this one go.

39:25.370 --> 39:26.403
[man groaning]

39:32.202 --> 39:33.719
_

39:42.153 --> 39:44.421
So what now?
Few days off from work?

39:44.423 --> 39:45.989
More than a few.

39:45.991 --> 39:49.526
Not sure I can
go back there, but...

39:49.528 --> 39:52.429
these amateur fights
got me thinking.

39:52.431 --> 39:55.364
Maybe there's a future
somewhere else.

39:55.366 --> 39:57.233
Maybe a city
where you could go pro.

39:57.235 --> 39:59.702
They pay a lot more
for each fight.

39:59.704 --> 40:01.738
Yeah.

40:01.740 --> 40:04.974
But for now there's
a more important one right here.

40:06.510 --> 40:08.277
Thanks, Riley.

40:10.113 --> 40:11.480
Your sister's waiting.

40:31.701 --> 40:33.268
(Reese)
New laptop?

40:33.270 --> 40:34.870
<i>What happened to the old one?</i>

40:34.872 --> 40:37.272
Claire has it.

40:37.274 --> 40:39.608
Which means Samaritan does.

40:39.610 --> 40:42.377
Root?
You're back?

40:42.379 --> 40:44.812
For about eight more seconds.

40:44.814 --> 40:46.747
New mission?

40:46.749 --> 40:48.816
There's a lot that's new.

40:51.387 --> 40:53.654
Root, Claire, Samaritan...

40:53.656 --> 40:55.590
mind catching me up, Finch?

40:55.592 --> 40:58.593
Claire played me
and very nearly won.

40:58.595 --> 41:00.661
If Root hadn't disabled
Samaritan's cameras

41:00.663 --> 41:02.063
and saved me,

41:02.065 --> 41:04.765
I'd be in the hands
of the enemy.

41:04.767 --> 41:07.267
However, there is
a glimmer of hope.

41:07.269 --> 41:10.337
I planted a tracking beacon
in the laptop Claire stole.

41:10.338 --> 41:13.070
_

41:13.075 --> 41:14.374
Nearly there.

41:14.652 --> 41:15.918
_

41:18.391 --> 41:19.589
_

41:20.648 --> 41:23.217
- No more glimmer?
- Indeed.

41:27.422 --> 41:29.556
This game was played to a draw.

41:30.517 --> 41:32.700
_

41:32.760 --> 41:35.595
We found and destroyed
the GPS beacon

41:35.597 --> 41:37.931
embedded in the laptop's core,
sir.

41:37.933 --> 41:40.800
- It was artfully placed.
- I've no doubt.

41:40.802 --> 41:43.036
And what about
its networking history?

41:43.038 --> 41:44.537
Wiped clean, I'm afraid.

41:44.539 --> 41:47.206
Keep looking.
And be careful.

41:47.208 --> 41:50.143
A laptop
from this particular person

41:50.145 --> 41:52.445
is hardly a benign treasure.

41:54.914 --> 41:57.517
<i>(Claire)</i>
<i>It's my fault, Mr. Greer.</i>

41:57.519 --> 41:59.519
If I hadn't taken him
to the school,

41:59.521 --> 42:00.620
if I had just
brought him in--

42:00.622 --> 42:02.321
Come, come, Claire.

42:02.323 --> 42:05.157
You did your best
to turn him into an asset,

42:05.159 --> 42:07.626
which was, after all,
your mission.

42:07.628 --> 42:10.362
And it's your steadfast belief
in your mission,

42:10.364 --> 42:14.232
in Samaritan,
that makes you so special,

42:14.234 --> 42:15.333
so unique.

42:18.571 --> 42:21.806
Just one thing,
Mr. Greer.

42:21.808 --> 42:23.808
The sniper shots
were supposed to miss

42:23.810 --> 42:27.512
to scare Mr. Finch
into trusting me.

42:27.514 --> 42:29.181
I could have died out there.

42:29.183 --> 42:32.317
For a good cause, my dear.

42:32.319 --> 42:34.653
All for a good cause.

42:34.655 --> 42:36.921
<i>Sorry to interrupt,</i>
<i>Mr. Greer,</i>

42:36.923 --> 42:38.389
but you need to leave
if you're going

42:38.391 --> 42:40.825
to make your meeting
with Mergers and Acquisitions.

42:40.827 --> 42:42.860
Ah, yes, an intriguing company

42:42.862 --> 42:45.096
making strides in the realm

42:45.098 --> 42:47.665
of simulating
and manipulating emotion

42:47.667 --> 42:51.602
and whose stock
appears primed for a fall.

43:02.080 --> 43:04.915
Such a pleasure
to meet the founder

43:04.917 --> 43:08.219
of an exciting venture
like yours.

43:08.221 --> 43:12.222
What a shame to see
you've hit a rather...

43:12.224 --> 43:15.458
tragic fork in the road.

43:15.460 --> 43:17.027
Shall we see if, together,

43:17.029 --> 43:19.129
we can't choose
the right way forward?
