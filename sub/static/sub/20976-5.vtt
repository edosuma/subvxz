more than the Mississippi River.

I was born with a cleft lip.
That means when your face

03:00.700 --> 03:06.433
is forming, your face right here
doesn't form together, and so

03:06.433 --> 03:09.300
you pretty much just have
an open gap in your lip.

03:09.300 --> 03:11.600
When I was young we traveled
a lot 'cause my mom was

03:11.600 --> 03:13.500

Moving around when I was young,
I got made fun of a lot

It was difficult, but, I mean,

03:24.033 --> 03:26.734
you just got to get through it.

03:26.734 --> 03:30.400
Sorry.
I had multiple surgeries

03:30.400 --> 03:32.767
to fix my lip.
My nose was really big.

03:32.767 --> 03:35.367
It was very crooked.
It slanted to the left

03:35.367 --> 03:38.500
due to my cleft lip,
and I did have a lump

03:38.500 --> 03:43.767
on the top of my nose as well.
So when I graduated high school,

03:43.767 --> 03:48.367
I decided to get a rhinoplasty.
A week after surgery, I didn't

03:48.367 --> 03:51.066
look terrible, so I was
pretty much happy with it, but

03:51.066 --> 03:54.367
a couple year after the surgery,
I just noticed my nose started

03:54.367 --> 03:58.233
slanting to the left again.
Then my nostrils were just two

03:58.233 --> 04:01.467
totally different sizes.
My right side is a lot longer

04:01.467 --> 04:04.600
than the left side.
When I breathe heavy or inhale,

04:04.600 --> 04:07.567
the right nostril
will completely close.

04:07.567 --> 04:10.533

to close the lip,

better, and I would like to fill

07:29.367 --> 07:32.633
in the gap with my lips so I can
just kind of have a fuller lip,

Pucker now for us.

08:13.467 --> 08:16.734
>> There's some decussation.
>> There's a muscle called

08:16.734 --> 08:21.467
a sphincter muscle, okay,
called the orbicularis oris.

08:21.467 --> 08:23.734
>> So sphincter--
>> Not that sphincter,

08:23.734 --> 08:25.567
by the way.
>> There's another sphincter.

08:25.567 --> 08:27.567
>> There's another sphincter.
>> That round muscle--

it looks like there's
a deficiency in the middle.

08:29.333 --> 08:31.600
>> Okay.
>> So the best thing to do would

08:31.600 --> 08:34.700
be to open that up, find the
muscle, put the muscle back

08:34.700 --> 08:37.600
together, and maybe also use
some filling around it.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.734
Right now, Liberty has a very
noticeable defect in her

08:40.734 --> 08:43.600
upper lip, and by tightening
the sphincter muscle and adding

08:43.600 --> 08:46.600
a little bit of fascia from her
scalp, I should be able to make

08:46.600 --> 08:49.700
her smile picture-perfect.
The good news is

08:49.700 --> 08:52.467
that we can help.
>> Yes!

08:52.467 --> 08:55.433
>> We can make your nose
a lot straighter,

08:55.433 --> 08:58.200
more symmetric.
Will it be perfect?

08:58.200 --> 09:00.467
No.

that's what's holding me back.

10:25.400 --> 10:28.300
Growing up in Florida was
pretty rough.

10:28.300 --> 10:30.567
It was very strict parents.
I didn't have any emotional

10:30.567 --> 10:33.667
support at home whatsoever,
so I turned to food as an

10:33.667 --> 10:36.667
emotional support, and was
gaining weight little by little,

10:36.667 --> 10:39.567
and I never knew in a million
years that I would creep up

10:39.567 --> 10:42.734
to 213 pounds.
I just thought, "Okay,

10:42.734 --> 10:46.433
I got to do something.
I got to go join a gym."

10:46.433 --> 10:49.567
I became obsessed.
I basically studied body

10:49.567 --> 10:52.600
building, how body builders
ate, how the way the body

10:52.600 --> 10:56.433
burns fat.
I was losing ten pounds

10:56.433 --> 11:03.266
every single month.
In January of 2010, I hit 124,

11:03.266 --> 11:07.500
almost a 100-pound weight loss.
After my weight loss,

11:07.500 --> 11:10.700
I was considering
competing as a fitness model,

11:10.700 --> 11:17.333
but I went from a 40 triple G
to a 32 B cup.

11:17.333 --> 11:20.300
I'm like, "Okay,
I have to get my breasts fixed."

11:20.300 --> 11:25.567
But on June 2nd 2011,
I was in a accident,

11:25.567 --> 11:28.600
and I didn't have my seat belt
on, and I rolled across the

11:28.600 --> 11:33.433
street in the middle of the
median, and all I remember was

11:33.433 --> 11:37.467
I'm laying like this,
and from my hips up is turned

11:37.467 --> 11:40.467
all the way to the right.
And I put my hand on my back,

11:40.467 --> 11:42.500
and my spine is sticking out
of my back, like,

11:42.500 --> 11:45.600
about this much.
I had several neurologists

11:45.600 --> 11:47.367
tell me I was never gonna
walk again.

11:47.367 --> 11:50.500
Paralyzed from the breast down,
in a wheelchair.

11:50.500 --> 11:53.600
So when I went back home,
I grabbed the walker,

11:53.600 --> 11:57.600
and I would try to stand up.
Eventually, I took one step

11:57.600 --> 12:00.467
with the walker.
I had fire in me.

12:00.467 --> 12:04.600
The walker turned into a cane,
and the cane turned into

12:04.600 --> 12:08.233
me taking little steps.
And I decided, "Okay,

12:08.233 --> 12:13.367
I am gonna become the world's
first partial paraplegic,

12:13.367 --> 12:17.266
disabled, fitness model."
In the middle of recovery,

12:17.266 --> 12:21.333
I met my now-husband, Ron.
My wedding pictures

12:21.333 --> 12:24.000
looked awful.
My breasts were

12:24.000 --> 12:28.100
little string beans.
So right after that, I had

12:28.100 --> 12:30.500
a long talk with my husband,
and he's like, "Well, you know,

12:30.500 --> 12:32.767
you got a birthday coming up.
I'll get your breasts done

12:32.767 --> 12:34.633
for you."
I get out of surgery,

12:34.633 --> 12:38.266
and my right breast is
way down here.

12:38.266 --> 12:41.433
I go in, and he's like,
"I just need to put in more

12:41.433 --> 12:44.000
saline in the right one.
That will lift it."

12:44.000 --> 12:46.500
So I'm like, "Okay,
he knows what he's doing."

12:46.500 --> 12:49.767
I come out of my second surgery,
I'm huge.

12:49.767 --> 12:52.767
My third surgery
he filled them up even more.

12:52.767 --> 12:56.500
So I had my fourth surgery
with the same surgeon.

12:56.500 --> 12:59.266
I had to because of
financial reasons.

12:59.266 --> 13:02.700
He was gonna fix it
and I looked so deformed.

13:02.700 --> 13:06.500
My husband was like, "Damn it,
we'll just find another doctor."

13:06.500 --> 13:10.266
The surgeon that I found
in Jacksonville told me

13:10.266 --> 13:13.400
it's gonna take $12,000
and two surgeries

13:13.400 --> 13:17.400
to reconstruct my breasts.
After my sixth surgery,

13:17.400 --> 13:20.433
they literally looked like
a pair of boxes.

13:20.433 --> 13:24.033
I had my seventh surgery,
and he's like, "We have to be

13:24.033 --> 13:29.033
a little more aggressive."
My eighth surgery, my implants

13:29.033 --> 13:33.300
are up to my neck.
My ninth surgery, the implant

13:33.300 --> 13:37.066
is still up to my collarbone.
I'm done.

13:37.066 --> 13:39.600
I'm done with the surgeon.
My fitness dreams

13:39.600 --> 13:43.300
are on the back burner
if I don't get them fixed.

13:43.300 --> 13:51.033
I can't do that having my
breasts look the way they do.

13:51.033 --> 13:54.300
>> Who do we have?
>> Megan has had a long,

13:54.300 --> 13:58.300
complicated history of multiple
breast surgeries, and every one

13:58.300 --> 14:01.700
of them went wrong.
Now, let me show you

14:01.700 --> 14:04.367
what I'm talking about.
So obviously she's into fitness.

14:04.367 --> 14:06.367
>> What's on the back
of her calves?

14:06.367 --> 14:09.367
>> She's got some kind
of stabilizers on her legs.

14:09.367 --> 14:11.633
We'll ask her about that.
So, you can see she's got

14:11.633 --> 14:14.300
encapsulation.
I mean, her right breast is

14:14.300 --> 14:17.567
touching her collarbone.
So, let's bring her in and find

14:17.567 --> 14:22.567
out what she wants to do.
>> Can you please send in Megan?

14:22.567 --> 14:24.734
>> Megan.
>> Hi.

14:24.734 --> 14:26.567
>> How are you?
>> How are you?

14:26.567 --> 14:28.300
Dr. Nassif, nice to meet you.
>> Hi, how are you?

14:28.300 --> 14:29.734
>> Terry Dubrow--pleasure.
>> Hi--nice to meet you.

14:29.734 --> 14:31.567
>> What's your name?
>> Ron.

14:31.567 --> 14:33.600
>> I'm very nervous
about seeing the doctors today.

14:33.600 --> 14:36.500
I'm nervous about if they can
even fix me.

14:36.500 --> 14:39.533
>> Megan, the first thing
we noticed about you in your

14:39.533 --> 14:42.500
picture is that you have some
kind of stabilizing device

14:42.500 --> 14:44.633
in your legs.
>> Those are my AFOs,

14:44.633 --> 14:48.367
artificial foot drop.
I'm a partial paraplegic.

14:48.367 --> 14:50.533
I'm paralyzed
from the ankles down.

14:50.533 --> 14:52.333
>> How did that happen?
>> Five years ago

14:52.333 --> 14:55.233
I was in an accident.
I didn't have my seatbelt on,

14:55.233 --> 14:57.367
and ended up fracturing
my spinal cord from L-1

14:57.367 --> 14:59.467
through L-5.
And when they told me

14:59.467 --> 15:02.533
I was never gonna walk again,
I began working out every day

15:02.533 --> 15:06.233
like crazy,
and one thing led to another,

15:06.233 --> 15:09.233
and my left quad started
to flex just a little bit,

15:09.233 --> 15:11.400
and that's all I needed.
Right then and there

15:11.400 --> 15:14.266
was a spark.
>> The fact that Megan recovered

15:14.266 --> 15:17.500
significant spinal cord function
after essentially being

15:17.500 --> 15:19.633
a full paraplegic
after her injury,

15:19.633 --> 15:22.633
is truly extraordinary,
and probably only occurs in less

15:22.633 --> 15:27.700
than one percent of patients.
You're obviously an inspiration

15:27.700 --> 15:30.667
to anyone who's had
difficulties in their life.

15:30.667 --> 15:33.667
However, your breasts are not
where you'd want them to be.

15:33.667 --> 15:35.433
>> Yeah,
here we go with this story.

15:35.433 --> 15:37.500
>> How many breast surgeries
have you had?

15:37.500 --> 15:39.266
>> Nine breast surgeries
in three years.

15:39.266 --> 15:41.667
>> Wow. Why?
>> I thought I picked a really,

15:41.667 --> 15:43.767
really good doctor.
And after surgery,

15:43.767 --> 15:46.700
this breast was right here
and this breast was up here.

15:46.700 --> 15:50.667
My second surgery with him,
he filled up this implant...

15:50.667 --> 15:53.000
>> More?
>> To match this one, thinking

15:53.000 --> 15:55.533
it would raise it higher.
Honestly, I don't even know

15:55.533 --> 15:59.533
how this doctor has his license.
So we looked for another doctor,

15:59.533 --> 16:03.300
and he said, "we need to do
two surgeries back-to-back to

16:03.300 --> 16:06.600
bring the implants back down."
>> That's a cause of concern,

16:06.600 --> 16:08.567
way up there.
>> Because it dips.

16:08.567 --> 16:11.000
>> Yeah.
>> And we constantly told him.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.266
I'm really worried
about my wife's health.

16:13.266 --> 16:15.266
That is the most important
thing to me.

16:15.266 --> 16:17.700
>> You're--I'm just being honest
with you--you're in a particular

16:17.700 --> 16:22.300
category of patients that's very
scary for the plastic surgeon,

16:22.300 --> 16:26.266
because now, you're potentially
surgery number ten for us,

16:26.266 --> 16:29.567
and your tissue has had
the heck beaten out of it.

16:29.567 --> 16:31.700
But let's go check it out.
Come on.

16:31.700 --> 16:33.533
>> Okay.
>> Let's go do this.

16:33.533 --> 16:37.367
>> Megan has had nine surgeries
in three years,

16:37.367 --> 16:41.333
so her tissue is really damaged,
and it's susceptible to

16:41.333 --> 16:44.600
healing issues such as infection
and wound breakdown,

16:44.600 --> 16:46.700
so Terry has his work
cut out for him.

16:46.700 --> 16:52.033
>> Okay, so flex your pecs.
Let me see what happens.

16:52.033 --> 16:55.333
So, you're under the muscle,
but you're really encapsulated.

16:55.333 --> 16:59.500
You've had a full-blown lift,
and they still, despite their

16:59.500 --> 17:04.600
best efforts, haven't been able
to get a good shape out of you.

17:04.600 --> 17:07.600
So you options are
implant removal,

17:07.600 --> 17:12.600
scar tissue removal,
leave them out,

17:12.600 --> 17:15.700
and do a tightening lift,
and try to get you a good shape.

17:15.700 --> 17:19.633
Choice two: go in there,
take the scar tissue out,

17:19.633 --> 17:22.633
put the implants where they
need to be.

17:22.633 --> 17:24.600
You'll get the upper fullness
you want,

17:24.600 --> 17:27.633
but then your risk
of a recurrent capsular

17:27.633 --> 17:30.066
contracture with movement up,
I would estimate

17:30.066 --> 17:32.467
it's almost 35%.
>> Number two.

17:32.467 --> 17:36.367
>> Okay, number two.
A lot of pressure.

17:36.367 --> 17:38.367
>> Don't you like a challenge?
>> We love the challenge.

17:38.367 --> 17:41.333
>> Love the challenge.
>> We live for the challenge.

17:41.333 --> 17:44.467
We are all about the challenge.
>> This is very risky

17:44.467 --> 17:48.533
for both the doctors and I,
so I've got to tell my body,

17:48.533 --> 17:50.667
"Okay, body, let's do this
just one more time."

17:50.667 --> 17:52.467
We're fighters.
>> We're fighters.

17:52.467 --> 17:54.333
>> Yeah.
>> Fighters, damn right.

17:54.333 --> 17:58.500
Let's fight away, okay?
Let's do this.

17:58.500 --> 18:02.266
>> I can still see your problem.
Look at this.

18:02.266 --> 18:03.767
>> It's bad.
I feel very insecure,

18:03.767 --> 18:06.400
and I hate it.
For real, I hate it.

18:06.400 --> 18:09.633
>> Hold on, the whole septum
just destabilized.

18:09.633 --> 18:12.767
The septum just dropped about
two centimeters, about that far.

18:12.767 --> 18:22.767
The whole septum is no good.
That was a terrifying situation.

>> For Liberty's surgery today,
I'll start with her

20:48.367 --> 20:50.433
lip scar revision.
I'll go inside the lip to

20:50.433 --> 20:53.000
reconnect the sphincter muscle,
and we'll harvest fascia

20:53.000 --> 20:56.266
from the left side of the scalp,
which we'll use to create volume

20:56.266 --> 20:58.767
where needed.
Moving on to the rhinoplasty,

20:58.767 --> 21:01.367
we'll remove scar tissue
from the tip of the nose,

21:01.367 --> 21:03.767
and take down her hump,
all the while using her own

21:03.767 --> 21:07.266
septal cartilage and PDS plate
to straighten the nose,

21:07.266 --> 21:10.300
open up the airway, and make her
nostrils more symmetric.

21:10.300 --> 21:12.400
Finally for the area of skin
between her nose

21:12.400 --> 21:14.400
and her upper lip,
we'll remove the depressed scar,

21:14.400 --> 21:21.266
and connect the tissue
to ensure that it heals flat.

21:21.266 --> 21:23.533
We're opening up
the central lip here

21:23.533 --> 21:25.633
to see what we can find.
So it looks like the muscles

21:25.633 --> 21:28.667
were separated,
so that's why there was

21:28.667 --> 21:31.667
a big depression right there.
We put the muscle back together

21:31.667 --> 21:35.066
since it was broken apart,
and then we put fascia

21:35.066 --> 21:37.033
from the scalp, wrapped it up,
and put it inside the lip.

21:37.033 --> 21:39.333
I got to tell you,
I think I like it.

21:39.333 --> 21:42.033
I mean, obviously she's not
collapsed anymore.

21:42.033 --> 21:45.300
She'll be swollen
and bruised for a while.

21:45.300 --> 21:50.266
But here, you see this though?
You just can't tell symmetry.

21:50.266 --> 21:52.533
So is there a good chance
that her lip will not be

21:52.533 --> 21:55.700
absolutely symmetric?
Yeah, like 85%.

21:55.700 --> 21:57.533
So we're finished now
with the lip.

21:57.533 --> 22:00.333
Let's go straight to the nose.
All right, here we go.

22:00.333 --> 22:02.700
She has absolutely no airway.
Like, I don't know how she

22:02.700 --> 22:05.600
breathes through this.
This septum is probably

22:05.600 --> 22:09.266
the worst deviated septum
that I've seen.

22:09.266 --> 22:12.567
I mean, what it is with her:
she's got a lot of bone,

22:12.567 --> 22:14.433
and it's obstructing
her whole airway.

22:14.433 --> 22:17.033
Usually when you have a septum,
it's comprised of bone

22:17.033 --> 22:20.600
and cartilage, maybe half-half,
but in Liberty's situation,

22:20.600 --> 22:24.066
it's mostly bone,
and it's obstructing her airway.

22:24.066 --> 22:27.433
Look at that thing.
That was obstructing her airway.

22:27.433 --> 22:30.700
We're now exploring the tip area
to see if the cartilage

22:30.700 --> 22:32.600
that's supporting the tip
is big enough.

22:32.600 --> 22:34.567
What is that--like three or four
millimeters?

22:34.567 --> 22:36.734
Yeah, that's, like, really
small, so someone really

22:36.734 --> 22:38.700
amputated that.
Liberty had a lot of her

22:38.700 --> 22:40.600
tip cartilage removed.
That doesn't make sense.

22:40.600 --> 22:43.233
You don't do that in a teenager
with a cleft nasal deformity,

22:43.233 --> 22:45.500
but this doctor did.
So I had to reconstruct the

22:45.500 --> 22:48.467
entire tip, add more cartilage
from her nasal septum

22:48.467 --> 22:52.033
to open up her airway.
Hold on.

22:52.033 --> 22:56.767
The whole septum
just destabilized.

22:56.767 --> 23:00.734
Hold on.
All of a sudden I look down,

23:00.734 --> 23:04.500
and I don't see the septum.
How did that happen?

23:04.500 --> 23:09.633
It just broke off from the bone.
All righty, that's not good.

23:09.633 --> 23:12.734
The septum just dropped about
two centimeters, about that far,

23:12.734 --> 23:15.367
so completely
just detached itself.

23:15.367 --> 23:19.467
The whole septum is no good.
That was a terrifying situation.

23:19.467 --> 23:22.000
That's called
a septal destabilization.

23:22.000 --> 23:26.266
But luckily what we were able
to do is put it back in place,

23:26.266 --> 23:29.467
stitch it to bones,
stitch it to cartilage,

23:29.467 --> 23:34.400
and we're safe.
Liberty's surgery is

23:34.400 --> 23:36.767
extremely difficult.
All right, give me a 15 blade.

23:36.767 --> 23:38.700
Let's start the lip scar
revision.

23:38.700 --> 23:42.300
We have to do that last because
the retraction on the nose

23:42.300 --> 23:45.400
will just rip it right apart.
Okay, so things are looking

23:45.400 --> 23:50.433
a lot better.
We'll have to see how she heals.

23:50.433 --> 23:52.767
So, we pushed back
the entire nose.

23:52.767 --> 23:55.633
We softened it.
It's straight.

23:55.633 --> 23:59.000
It looks symmetric.
The base of the nose

23:59.000 --> 24:04.667
is about 85% better.
The scar revision on the lip

24:04.667 --> 24:07.400
in between the nose and the
red part is perfect.

24:07.400 --> 24:10.000
Looks great, and I think
putting the muscle together

24:10.000 --> 24:12.367
and putting the fascia
in the lower lip is fantastic.

24:12.367 --> 24:14.667
Everything about this nose was
difficult, but overall,

24:14.667 --> 24:17.433
I'm very pleased.
Liberty's got a long way to go.

24:17.433 --> 24:19.066
I mean, her tip is gonna be
swollen.

24:19.066 --> 24:20.700
We're gonna have to see how it
heals in regards to it being

24:20.700 --> 24:26.000
straight, but she needs
a good two years to heal.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.700
>> You had symmastia
with two 90 cc implants?

24:27.700 --> 24:29.700
>> Yeah.
>> Unfortunately,

24:29.700 --> 24:33.400
it was probably
just a poorly done procedure.

24:33.400 --> 24:35.567
I'm having a lot of trouble
getting these implants out.

24:35.567 --> 24:39.300
Megan has a lot of scar tissue
as a reaction to her previous

24:39.300 --> 24:41.233
implant surgery.

24:46.033 --> 24:47.767
>> ♪ I want to be perfect ♪

24:51.300 --> 24:52.734
>> Hi.
I'm Megan.

24:52.734 --> 24:54.600
I'm here for my surgery
with Dr. Dubrow.

24:54.600 --> 24:56.400
>> Go ahead and sign in,
and we'll get you taken

24:56.400 --> 24:58.066
right back.
>> Okay, thank you.

24:58.066 --> 25:01.500
At first I was very excited,
but I'm actually getting more

25:01.500 --> 25:03.734
and more nervous about it.
I just hope my body

25:03.734 --> 25:06.567
doesn't reject the implant.
>> Megan, how are you?

25:06.567 --> 25:08.333
>> Dr. Dubrow, good.
How are you?

25:08.333 --> 25:09.734
>> Good.
Good to see you.

25:09.734 --> 25:12.734
So we're gonna sew a piece
of artificial skin in there

25:12.734 --> 25:16.633
to try to reduce the chance
that you will encapsulate again,

25:16.633 --> 25:18.633
but you understand there's still
a significant risk

25:18.633 --> 25:21.300
of encapsulation.
>> I just, I just have to know,

25:21.300 --> 25:22.734
I don't want to be saying
"what if" for the rest

25:22.734 --> 25:24.567
of my life.
>> It's the final shot, right?

25:24.567 --> 25:26.333
>> This is the final shot,
right.

25:26.333 --> 25:28.066
>> Okay, that's fair.
All right, let's rock and roll.

25:28.066 --> 25:33.233
The only thing that really
changes today is that I'm

25:33.233 --> 25:36.333
a different surgeon than her
previous surgeons.

25:36.333 --> 25:38.433
So I need to have
a different plan,

25:38.433 --> 25:40.734
otherwise I'm making
the same mistake

25:40.734 --> 25:43.734
her previous surgeons did,
and I don't want to do that.

25:43.734 --> 25:47.266
For Megan's surgery today,
I'll begin by making incisions

25:47.266 --> 25:49.667
around her areolas.
I'll then go into Megan's

25:49.667 --> 25:52.633
breast pockets, and line them
with cadaver skin to reinforce

25:52.633 --> 25:55.467
the pockets, and hopefully
minimize her risk for

25:55.467 --> 25:58.367
capsular contracture.
I'll then place a new pair

25:58.367 --> 26:00.667
of implants in the reinforced
pockets, which will hopefully

26:00.667 --> 26:04.266
satisfy Megan, giving her
the large, symmetrical breasts

26:04.266 --> 26:07.367
she's always wanted.
Okay, so first we'll start by

26:07.367 --> 26:11.367
making the incision going down
to the breast implant pocket,

26:11.367 --> 26:14.500
and seeing what the implant
and the pocket looks like.

26:14.500 --> 26:19.633
Boy, you can see a ton of
stitches and--

26:19.633 --> 26:24.633
It's like Megan's personal diary
of her nine previous surgeries

26:24.633 --> 26:27.633
in here.
Look at that.

26:27.633 --> 26:34.266
Come here, you.
Boy, they're locked in.

26:34.266 --> 26:37.100
I'm having a lot of trouble
getting these implants out.

26:37.100 --> 26:40.567
Clearly, Megan has a lot
of scar tissue as a reaction

26:40.567 --> 26:45.633
to her previous
implant surgery.

26:45.633 --> 26:51.400
Look at all that scar tissue.
Anything I can do to minimize

26:51.400 --> 26:54.100
the chance that this will
come back again, I want to do.

26:54.100 --> 26:56.500
Okay, do you have a sizer
or something?

26:56.500 --> 27:02.000
>> One.
>> So here's 300.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.667
I think it looks kind of nice,
doesn't it?

27:03.667 --> 27:06.567
I'm giving her a full D.
Although my goal is

27:06.567 --> 27:10.533
to give Megan significantly
larger breasts using implants,

27:10.533 --> 27:14.533
there's a limit to how big
I can make her, because her

27:14.533 --> 27:17.467
chances of a capsular
contracture and a complication

27:17.467 --> 27:21.734
go up for every cc I increase
the implant size.

27:21.734 --> 27:24.600
Okay, so we're gonna open up
the cadaver skin.

27:24.600 --> 27:29.133
So this is what it looks like.
We're gonna use several pieces

27:29.133 --> 27:31.533
of patch like this
along the bottom part.

27:31.533 --> 27:34.400
Cadaver skin can help
to minimize the chance

27:34.400 --> 27:38.300
of capsular contracture
by lining the implant pocket

27:38.300 --> 27:41.533
and minimizing the chance
of excess scar tissue

27:41.533 --> 27:50.633
from being deposited.
Okay, here we go.

27:50.633 --> 27:52.700
Boy, I hope she's happy
with this.

27:52.700 --> 27:57.033
If she gets breast greedy,
this is never gonna work.

27:57.033 --> 28:00.734
Sit this up
and see what it looks like.

28:00.734 --> 28:03.433
That's as big as we can fit,

28:03.433 --> 28:05.567
right?
>> No doubt.

28:05.567 --> 28:08.734

downsizing of your implants.

31:58.133 --> 32:01.767
Like, half the size
to allow that new room to heal.

32:01.767 --> 32:04.767
>> These give me a lot of work,
like, for calendar,

32:04.767 --> 32:07.500
magazine, you know.
I need the big breasts.

32:07.500 --> 32:11.000
>> Okay.
>> It doesn't work smaller.

32:11.000 --> 32:14.300
So the treatment comes
at a cost, and the cost

32:14.300 --> 32:16.633
you're not willing to pay,
and that is going smaller.

32:16.633 --> 32:21.500
>> I don't feel happy,
of course, because I was hope

32:21.500 --> 32:25.433
to fix my problem, but if I go
with smaller in my size,

32:25.433 --> 32:29.100
I will lose many work.
>> So I think the solution

32:29.100 --> 32:31.767
right now is no solution.
Right

32:31.767 --> 32:34.033
I think you're in a good place,
don't you?

32:34.033 --> 32:36.367
>> Okay, thank you.
>> Okay, now, okay,

32:36.367 --> 32:40.300
so you had lose skin
on your arms,

32:40.300 --> 32:43.433
and you had what's called a
limited incision bracheoplasty.

32:43.433 --> 32:46.533
>> Yeah.
>> Can you turn around?

32:46.533 --> 32:49.400
>> Take a look at these scars
all the way back here.

32:49.400 --> 32:51.567
>> Right.
So you not only have a scar

32:51.567 --> 32:54.667
that extends past what we call
the posterior axillary crease,

32:54.667 --> 32:56.700
right?
It's also bunched up.

32:56.700 --> 33:00.333
This is called a dog ear.
Dog ears are excess skin

33:00.333 --> 33:05.300
at the ends of the wounds
which look like they're sort of

33:05.300 --> 33:07.700
hanging as if they're
sort of ears on a dog.

33:07.700 --> 33:10.667
You have had some significant
liposuction here,

33:10.667 --> 33:13.033
so now the skin's sort of
a little thin,

33:13.033 --> 33:15.667
and that's one of the reasons
you have laxy.

33:15.667 --> 33:19.100
But I will tell you there is
an operation you could do

33:19.100 --> 33:21.700
to take it to the next level,
which is a cut that goes

33:21.700 --> 33:23.734
from your armpit
all the way down to your elbow.

33:23.734 --> 33:26.300
Is that really something
you really want to do?

33:26.300 --> 33:28.700
Do you really want to trade
a scar to give you a what--

33:28.700 --> 33:33.066
10% improvement?
>> For sure, no.

33:33.066 --> 33:35.033
>> Right.
>> No, it's no.

33:35.033 --> 33:38.500
I want to have perfect arms,
but I don't willing to do

33:38.500 --> 33:41.700
some surgery that give me
a lot of scar.

33:41.700 --> 33:44.600
>> You both are beautiful.
The last thing you want to do

33:44.600 --> 33:47.467
when you're really young is
to have that long scar

33:47.467 --> 33:49.600
underneath your arm.
>> No, you're right.

33:49.600 --> 33:52.433
>> Not a good option.
>> We feel very confident

33:52.433 --> 33:56.600
right now, and we will try
to do our best the way we are.

33:56.600 --> 33:58.700
We think we don't need
surgeries.

33:58.700 --> 34:01.467

>> Okay.

35:10.567 --> 35:13.633
>> To your lip, remember I was
talking about the muscle?

35:13.633 --> 35:16.100
It wasn't together
in the middle.

35:16.100 --> 35:19.033
So we were able to put
the muscle back together.

35:19.033 --> 35:20.767
>> Okay.
>> And then we took some of

35:20.767 --> 35:24.333
the tissue from your scalp
and added that to give it

35:24.333 --> 35:28.033
all some more bulk, okay?
When the swelling goes down

35:28.033 --> 35:31.533
on Liberty's lips, they will
not be perfectly symmetrical,

35:31.533 --> 35:35.300
but I hope that we'll be able to
get an 80% improvement on her

35:35.300 --> 35:37.734
lips, and in my book,
that's a win.

35:37.734 --> 35:41.467
Now the nose.
You had a very, very bad

35:41.467 --> 35:44.400
deviated septum, but we were
able to get that straight.

35:44.400 --> 35:47.066
Brought your bones in.
Took off the hump significantly.

I obviously had to take out

a air sizer in, which means

really good initially,
