WEBVTT

00:05.094 --> 00:07.519
Okay, my "days of the
week" undies are done,

00:07.520 --> 00:09.148
but your bra is still out there drying.

00:09.149 --> 00:11.058
Still? There's not much there to dry.

00:11.059 --> 00:14.078
It's not funny.

00:18.216 --> 00:20.294
Hey, wait, where's Friday?

00:21.052 --> 00:23.921
No, today's Saturday.

00:27.207 --> 00:30.817
Hello. Ho-oh! Thank God it's Friday.

00:31.496 --> 00:33.178
Yeah, they fell on my car.

00:33.227 --> 00:36.274
Wow. You know, that's actually not the
craziest place that pair has landed.

00:37.068 --> 00:39.487
I'd like to hear more
about that. I'm Tyler.

00:39.536 --> 00:41.536
- I'm Gabi.
- I'm Sofia.

00:41.537 --> 00:43.571
She has a boyfriend. I do not.

00:43.947 --> 00:46.364
Neither do I... have a boyfriend.

00:46.365 --> 00:49.399
You have to say that in San
Francisco. Especially with this hair.

00:50.096 --> 00:51.695
It's really pretty.

00:51.765 --> 00:54.169
Well, since I've already
seen your underwear,

00:54.170 --> 00:56.501
I think it's only right
that I buy you dinner.

00:56.502 --> 00:58.421
Oh. Yeah.

00:58.422 --> 01:00.408
I mean, no. Wait!

01:00.409 --> 01:02.509
Maybe. It's kind of complicated.

01:03.007 --> 01:04.789
Wait, I'm confused.

01:04.790 --> 01:06.685
Wait, so you do have a boyfriend?

01:06.686 --> 01:09.431
No, I have a boss.

01:09.542 --> 01:11.790
And you know how when you're
dating someone and your boss isn't,

01:11.791 --> 01:13.985
- it can be kind of awkward?
- Not really.

01:16.212 --> 01:18.258
Can you excuse us for a minute, please?

01:18.259 --> 01:19.576
- I kind of have...
- Stay here. Here.

01:19.577 --> 01:20.800
Ooh, a muffin.

01:22.547 --> 01:25.416
Gabi, why are you thinking about Josh?

01:25.450 --> 01:28.052
Your panties flew to that
guy. Trust their wisdom.

01:28.576 --> 01:31.697
Yeah, I know, but I just started
going back to work at Josh's, and...

01:31.698 --> 01:33.759
and I'm afraid it's just
so delicate that if I start

01:33.760 --> 01:35.321
dating someone, it could be kinda weird.

01:35.322 --> 01:38.230
Yeah, well, then just
don't talk about it at work.

01:40.498 --> 01:42.710
That had never occurred to me.

01:43.684 --> 01:46.434
Uh, Tyler, hi. I'd, ah,
I'd love to go out with ya.

01:46.638 --> 01:48.342
- When?
- Um...

01:48.452 --> 01:52.009
- What's your favorite color?
- Black.

01:54.346 --> 01:55.657
Wednesday it is.

02:17.869 --> 02:20.217
Gabi, you're awfully quiet this morning.

02:21.172 --> 02:24.074
That's because I'm too
busy not talking about it.

02:26.025 --> 02:28.894
- Not talking about what?
- I met the cutest guy!

02:29.576 --> 02:32.148
He showed up right at my door
looking for the owner of my underwear.

02:32.149 --> 02:33.851
It's like a fairy tale.

02:34.798 --> 02:36.520
Good morning.

02:36.623 --> 02:38.814
And here comes your fairy godmother.

02:40.139 --> 02:42.774
Which makes you what, the ugly stepsister?

02:43.532 --> 02:45.228
So tell me more about this guy.

02:45.229 --> 02:47.639
Okay. He's in a band,
and he plays the sticks.

02:47.640 --> 02:49.396
Which means he plays the drums.

02:49.397 --> 02:52.335
It is so sexy when some
guy just plays the dr...

02:54.088 --> 02:57.941
Wow! When you walk in, Gabi shuts up.

02:59.043 --> 03:02.380
How did you do that? Teach me!

03:03.916 --> 03:05.851
Well, it's easy.

03:05.890 --> 03:07.854
All you do is catch her when
she's talking about a guy.

03:07.855 --> 03:13.064
I was not talking about a guy.

03:14.212 --> 03:18.128
I was talking about Animal
from The Muppets.

03:18.162 --> 03:20.337
Yeah. He plays the drums.

03:20.338 --> 03:23.417
Yolanda thought he played the
guitar, which is why I was telling...

03:23.418 --> 03:24.618
Gabi.

03:25.236 --> 03:27.784
It's okay to talk about your dating life.

03:28.155 --> 03:30.486
Really? It doesn't make you feel weird?

03:30.487 --> 03:32.286
You're not uncomfortable?
You're not just saying that

03:32.287 --> 03:35.197
to put on a brave face 'cause
secretly you're dying inside?

03:36.656 --> 03:38.758
Gabi, I promise you.

03:38.868 --> 03:40.642
I am totally cool with it.

03:40.952 --> 03:42.807
He's so not cool with it.

03:43.789 --> 03:46.860
Gabi, I thought we talked about
you not talking about it at work.

03:47.058 --> 03:49.723
We did. And I failed.

03:50.332 --> 03:54.064
But the good news is I realized
all I have to do is set up Josh.

03:54.098 --> 03:56.900
And the bad news is that's
the dumbest idea ever.

03:57.926 --> 04:01.904
No. Sofia, he's not gonna
be cool with me dating Tyler

04:01.905 --> 04:05.008
unless he's dating somebody
too. How do you not know this?

04:05.881 --> 04:09.350
Well, because my brain runs
on knowledge, not Funyun dust.

04:10.508 --> 04:13.133
Hey, do you think Josh would be
into your pretty friend Dee Dee?

04:13.302 --> 04:14.960
S-T-Dee-Dee?

04:15.680 --> 04:17.079
I don't think so.

04:18.355 --> 04:20.223
Oh, what about... no.

04:20.257 --> 04:22.695
Hey, what about... no.

04:23.647 --> 04:26.062
What about...

04:26.097 --> 04:27.511
Her.

04:28.933 --> 04:32.003
Hey, pretty girl. What's your name?

04:32.551 --> 04:35.639
- Sarah.
- Oh, Sarah.

04:35.673 --> 04:38.809
Sarah. Sexy name. You single?

04:38.959 --> 04:40.955
Look, I'm flattered,
but I'm not into girls.

04:40.956 --> 04:43.084
Oh, oh, no, no, no.
It's, ah, it's not for me.

04:43.085 --> 04:44.514
It's for him.

04:44.762 --> 04:48.451
His name's Josh, he's 30,
sexy and super successful.

04:48.486 --> 04:50.921
Oh. Well, if he's so great,
why don't you date him?

04:50.955 --> 04:54.220
Because he is my boss, and that
would be super unprofessional.

04:55.614 --> 04:57.794
- He does have a cute smile.
- Yeah.

04:57.828 --> 05:00.963
- Looks even cuter in his Porsche.
- Wow.

05:06.618 --> 05:08.701
Alan, calm down!

05:09.573 --> 05:11.622
So your drag queen bingo host dropped out,

05:11.680 --> 05:14.303
and you need to find a
man dressed as a woman.

05:16.080 --> 05:18.476
No, I will not do it.

05:19.656 --> 05:23.392
I know you call me your Asian princess,
but that's just for the bedroom!

05:26.323 --> 05:28.457
Step away from the fudgey cakes!

05:28.793 --> 05:32.462
We will find you another
bingo host, I promise. Bye!

05:34.356 --> 05:36.846
Did I hear you say you need a bingo host?

05:37.807 --> 05:40.986
Because I call bingo at
church, and I'm damn good at it.

05:42.181 --> 05:45.108
Trust me, Yolanda. This
is not the gig for you.

05:45.387 --> 05:47.719
Oh, come on! I got a whole shtick.

05:47.720 --> 05:52.082
I grab a ball and I call out,
"I-8... a whole pizza, y'all."

05:53.951 --> 05:56.044
It killed the reverend.

05:56.045 --> 05:58.850
It's okay, he's in a better place.

06:00.054 --> 06:01.780
Sorry, Yolanda, but the answer's no.

06:01.781 --> 06:03.560
Oh, come on. Why can't I do it?

06:03.594 --> 06:05.033
Because you're not a...

06:05.644 --> 06:07.552
you know what? Spin.

06:10.968 --> 06:13.136
You might be able to pull this off.

06:13.170 --> 06:16.331
That's what I've been sayin'!

06:16.332 --> 06:18.842
Thanks, Elliot, oh! You the man!

06:18.876 --> 06:20.076
No, you are.

06:22.535 --> 06:24.625
Never fear, lunch is here.

06:25.816 --> 06:28.975
Okay. We've got a fork, a
knife, a spoon, and a Sarah.

06:29.253 --> 06:32.489
- What's a Sarah?
- This.

06:32.523 --> 06:35.665
She lives in my building, she's
super cute, she's a paralegal,

06:35.666 --> 06:37.681
she does pilates.

06:37.797 --> 06:39.090
What are you doing?

06:39.197 --> 06:41.926
So you know how you haven't
dated anybody in a while?

06:41.927 --> 06:43.992
By choice. My choice, not theirs.

06:44.595 --> 06:47.108
- Well, my choice is Sarah.
- No, thank you.

06:47.157 --> 06:50.022
Gabi, I can get a girl on my own. I'm me.

06:50.155 --> 06:54.147
But it would be the best thing
for me... you... Sarah... everyone.

06:54.580 --> 06:57.144
Look, I just feel like after
everything that happened between us,

06:57.145 --> 06:59.949
- you know, all that "sturff"...
- Gabi, "enurf."

06:59.984 --> 07:02.833
I just thought you might be a little
uncomfortable if I'm dating someone

07:02.834 --> 07:05.782
and you're not because you
might still have feelings

07:05.783 --> 07:08.110
for a certain someone.

07:08.669 --> 07:10.103
Set it up.

07:10.314 --> 07:12.762
Or better yet, why don't
we all go out together.

07:12.797 --> 07:16.135
How about that? Me, Sarah, you, Animal.

07:16.949 --> 07:18.230
Great!

07:18.231 --> 07:20.122
Okay, oh, uh, but can we do it tonight?

07:20.123 --> 07:23.106
Because today is Wednesday, and I
made a really cute underwear joke.

07:28.255 --> 07:30.935
So, uh, Gabi tells me that
you're the drummer in a band.

07:30.936 --> 07:34.035
- That's awesome.
- Yeah. We're one hit from making it big.

07:34.629 --> 07:37.461
That's the name of our band,
"One hit from making it big."

07:38.501 --> 07:40.167
Have you heard any of their music?

07:40.168 --> 07:42.279
No, but I heard him tapping on the table

07:42.280 --> 07:45.307
and he's very talented.

07:45.560 --> 07:47.636
So, uh, Sarah, do you want
to help me with dessert?

07:47.644 --> 07:50.401
Yeah, and if that's code for "let's
talk about the boys," hell yeah.

07:50.402 --> 07:51.886
Okay.

07:52.970 --> 07:54.374
Thank you.

07:57.987 --> 08:01.306
Gabi mentioned you met, uh, at
her place. Do you live nearby?

08:01.349 --> 08:03.672
Only on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

08:04.789 --> 08:05.989
What?

08:06.201 --> 08:08.959
Yeah, well, Mondays and
Wednesdays is street cleaning

08:08.960 --> 08:12.876
and weekends I find it best
to park outside the city.

08:15.471 --> 08:19.407
Because... you live... in your car?

08:19.408 --> 08:21.385
Yep.

08:21.412 --> 08:25.093
I re-jiggered the seat so I
almost have a full recline.

08:25.124 --> 08:28.814
And I got a piña colada air freshener,
so it's like I'm always on vacation.

08:28.815 --> 08:31.682
Sweet. Hey, give me a second.

08:37.727 --> 08:41.663
- Tyler is homeless.
- What?

08:41.698 --> 08:44.533
I shouldn't say he's homeless.
His car is his home, like a turtle.

08:44.996 --> 08:48.040
- Okay, where is this coming from?
- He told me, proudly.

08:48.041 --> 08:50.603
- Got it straight from the turtle's mouth.
- I don't believe you.

08:50.604 --> 08:53.181
- Hey, where's the bathroom?
- Oh, it's just right down the hall.

08:53.181 --> 08:56.311
Oh, I love bathrooms I don't
need a quarter to get into.

08:56.780 --> 08:59.271
Hey, is it cool if I
hand-wash my shirt in there?

09:01.323 --> 09:03.509
Oh, you know what? I'm cool.

09:06.084 --> 09:08.469
Okay, that doesn't prove he's homeless.

09:08.470 --> 09:10.826
Oh, the reason I'm asking
is 'cause I live in my car.

09:11.834 --> 09:13.309
Okay, that does.

09:19.683 --> 09:23.753
Hey, y'all. Check out my new
dress for hosting bingo night.

09:23.780 --> 09:26.242
It's gonna show off all my curves.

09:26.250 --> 09:30.120
Oh... ooh! And maybe
a little side boob too.

09:30.694 --> 09:32.129
Nice.

09:33.218 --> 09:34.463
Not really.

09:34.498 --> 09:37.266
Don't you have anything
flashier? It's a bar!

09:37.294 --> 09:41.610
Something sparkly, that accentuates
your broad sexy shoulders

09:41.618 --> 09:43.845
and your strong, shapely legs.

09:44.563 --> 09:48.473
- Yeah! This ain't church bingo.
- Testify!

09:48.951 --> 09:52.815
But if I'm gonna be showing all
that skin, I gotta go get waxed.

09:53.951 --> 09:55.202
Don't bother.

09:58.988 --> 10:00.650
- Good morning, Josh.
- Oh, hey!

10:00.651 --> 10:02.350
How'd your night go last night with Tyler?

10:02.381 --> 10:04.710
Did you guys use protection?
You know, seat belts?

10:05.762 --> 10:08.330
Oh, are those the kind
of jokes you use on Sarah?

10:08.365 --> 10:09.865
How'd that work out for ya?

10:09.866 --> 10:12.782
Something tells me I'm gonna see her again.

10:12.812 --> 10:14.056
- Morning.
- Told ya.

10:15.472 --> 10:18.575
Hi, Sarah. I had a great
night with you last night.

10:18.576 --> 10:20.861
- Me too. Can't wait.
- Call ya later?

10:23.079 --> 10:25.399
Gabi, thanks for the awesome setup.

10:25.419 --> 10:28.427
I'm just so relieved. There are
so many weirdos in this city.

10:29.013 --> 10:30.992
Yep, there's one parked on every corner.

10:31.796 --> 10:33.882
You know, I-I think I
left my keys upstairs.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.083
Oh.

10:39.268 --> 10:40.468
Shit!

10:42.649 --> 10:43.908
Oh! Shoot...

10:44.434 --> 10:46.094
Sarah, I found your...

10:46.812 --> 10:48.570
jar of teeth?

10:50.102 --> 10:53.004
Really, really creepy jar of teeth!

10:55.078 --> 10:57.382
What the hell?

10:58.577 --> 11:01.246
I-I know I must have put
them up here somewhere.

11:07.385 --> 11:11.527
Uh, maybe you wanna... check your purse?

11:13.343 --> 11:15.860
Hm... let's see...

11:16.266 --> 11:19.221
Oh! Here they are. Ah!

11:19.222 --> 11:22.408
Don't you hate it when something is right
in front of you and you can't see it?

11:23.436 --> 11:25.052
No, I didn't see anything.

11:26.176 --> 11:28.407
Okay, well, see you back at the apartment.

11:28.871 --> 11:30.946
Not if I lock my door.

11:33.225 --> 11:35.140
Josh, Josh, Josh, Josh!

11:35.209 --> 11:37.047
I accidentally knocked Sarah's purse over,

11:37.048 --> 11:39.042
and you're never gonna
believe what came out!

11:39.522 --> 11:43.340
- A jar of teeth.
- What?

11:43.341 --> 11:45.878
A jar of teeth! But wait, that's not all.

11:45.879 --> 11:48.506
There was also a silver pointy
thing, and a pully thing,

11:48.507 --> 11:52.186
and a clampy thing, and I think
she uses them for bad things.

11:52.187 --> 11:55.137
Okay, Gabi, calm down. I'm
not you saw what you saw...

11:55.171 --> 11:57.090
There was a saw too!

11:57.207 --> 11:58.721
You have to stop dating her.

12:00.243 --> 12:01.977
Oh, Gabi, I see what's going on here.

12:02.012 --> 12:04.428
Remember when you thought
I'd be uncomfortable

12:04.429 --> 12:06.422
if you were dating somebody and I wasn't?

12:07.050 --> 12:09.585
- Z-z-z-oop.
- No.

12:09.619 --> 12:11.915
No. That is not what's
happening here, okay?

12:11.916 --> 12:14.728
- She's sick. She could be dangerous.
- Oh...

12:14.729 --> 12:17.326
Look... look, I'm not saying
you're doing it on purpose.

12:17.360 --> 12:19.328
I just think it's a little unconscious.

12:19.362 --> 12:22.818
Yeah? Well, I think you're gonna
be in a cage yelling, "Help me!"

12:22.819 --> 12:25.757
But because you have no teeth,
it's gonna come out, "Melp me!

12:27.879 --> 12:29.646
"Melp me!

12:30.810 --> 12:32.644
Melp me!"

12:37.794 --> 12:40.119
I dropped her purse on the
ground, and at first I was like,

12:40.120 --> 12:42.012
"Oh, no, I hope I didn't break her phone."

12:42.013 --> 12:44.823
And then I was like, "Oh,
no, I found a jar of teeth!"

12:47.092 --> 12:48.792
Really, Gabi?

12:48.793 --> 12:51.586
Or is this like the time you thought
that police horse winked at you?

12:52.118 --> 12:56.540
No! Okay? I saw them.
I held them in my hands.

12:56.541 --> 12:58.470
What is it gonna take to
get people to believe me?

12:58.471 --> 13:00.928
- You don't have to prove it to me.
- Yes, yes, yes!

13:00.929 --> 13:02.452
- I have to prove it.
- I'm not gonna help...

13:02.453 --> 13:03.653
and you're gonna help me!

13:12.819 --> 13:16.295
Sarah, hi. Can you help me? I lost my dog.

13:17.071 --> 13:19.880
You have a dog? I didn't
think they let us have pets.

13:19.881 --> 13:22.666
Right. Uh... It's a friend's dog...

13:22.667 --> 13:24.920
Ryan Gosling.

13:25.231 --> 13:28.100
You're friends with Ryan Gosling?

13:28.134 --> 13:31.036
No, no. No, that's the name of the dog.

13:31.070 --> 13:33.683
I think I just saw him! Um,
can you please come help?

13:33.684 --> 13:37.075
- R-Ryan Gosling! Come here, boy!
- Ryan!

13:46.625 --> 13:50.267
Okay. If I were a creepy jar
of teeth, where would I be?

13:58.389 --> 14:01.458
Ryan Gosling! Ryan Gosling!

14:04.395 --> 14:07.075
A-ha! Oh, no, these are Tic Tacs.

14:07.845 --> 14:10.779
I'm sorry, good luck finding Ryan Gosling.

14:25.650 --> 14:27.072
Josh!

14:28.486 --> 14:31.221
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

14:31.256 --> 14:35.477
I'm so scared. I'm so scared.

14:37.929 --> 14:39.847
Hi, I'm calling about
your ad on craigslist.

14:39.847 --> 14:41.695
Do you still have the electric saw?

14:42.784 --> 14:45.252
Oh, good. Does it cut through bone?

14:46.454 --> 14:48.626
Perfect. Thank you.

14:49.776 --> 14:52.664
Please be Sofia. Please be
Sofia. Please be Sofia. Please...

14:55.360 --> 14:57.297
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:57.298 --> 14:59.897
- I got your text and I jumped in my car.
- Mm-hm...

14:59.898 --> 15:01.947
Then I got your photo
and forgot how to drive.

15:03.104 --> 15:06.039
How does a glass of wine sound?

15:06.073 --> 15:08.077
Like you're gonna poison
him and steal his teeth!

15:08.190 --> 15:11.778
- Sounds good to me.
- That's why I already poured one.

15:11.813 --> 15:13.881
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

15:13.882 --> 15:16.416
It's poison! Don't drink
it! Don't drink it, no!

15:16.451 --> 15:18.738
Don't drink it! Don't drink it! No!

15:18.739 --> 15:20.620
- Get away from him, you freak!
- Gabi!

15:20.655 --> 15:22.556
What the hell are you
doing in my apartment?

15:22.590 --> 15:25.492
- Explain yourself!
- Explain yourself!

15:25.526 --> 15:27.045
You're the one hiding in my closet.

15:27.046 --> 15:28.965
You're the one with a closet full of teeth!

15:28.966 --> 15:31.331
Josh, look! Do you remember
when you thought I was crazy?

15:31.365 --> 15:33.800
Well... z-z-z-oop!

15:34.464 --> 15:36.709
- Uh, Sarah?
- I can explain.

15:36.710 --> 15:39.182
I make jewelry out of
teeth and sell it on Etsy.

15:39.183 --> 15:41.155
Huh! Yeah, like that's a thing.

15:41.683 --> 15:42.883
It is a thing.

15:42.884 --> 15:45.159
Well, why are there all the
names on the jars, Sarah?

15:45.160 --> 15:47.854
- They're my customers.
- Well, Josh is not a customer.

15:47.855 --> 15:49.572
So, explain that.

15:49.573 --> 15:51.816
I was making him a
surprise pair of cufflinks.

15:51.817 --> 15:55.336
You hear that, Gabi? She was
making me a surprise pair of...

15:55.523 --> 15:57.488
teeth cufflinks.

15:58.656 --> 16:02.165
Well, Sarah, there's just
one little hole in your story.

16:02.166 --> 16:04.113
A cavity, if you will.

16:04.273 --> 16:08.242
Where is all of this so-called teeth
jewelry I am hearing so much about?

16:11.891 --> 16:15.728
Oh. Story checks out.

16:15.987 --> 16:17.622
Mystery explained.

16:17.845 --> 16:21.440
My work here is done. I will take my leave.

16:21.862 --> 16:23.312
Goodbye!

16:24.199 --> 16:26.966
- I'm so sorry.
- It's not your fault.

16:26.988 --> 16:29.043
A lot of people think
teeth jewelry's weird.

16:29.423 --> 16:32.068
Okay, thank God. I wasn't gonna
say anything, but it's kinda weird.

16:32.069 --> 16:35.295
I mean, I don't even wear it myself.
But there is a whole market for it:

16:35.296 --> 16:37.393
Goths, metalheads, dental hygienists.

16:37.394 --> 16:39.390
Really? Hm.

16:39.391 --> 16:41.059
I mean, I guess that's kinda cool.

16:41.219 --> 16:42.622
Where do you get these teeth from?

16:42.623 --> 16:45.541
I break into morgues.

16:45.542 --> 16:47.574
She breaks into... yep, time to go.

17:03.880 --> 17:05.079
Thank you!

17:05.920 --> 17:08.295
Damn! Work it, girl!

17:08.407 --> 17:10.363
Well thank you, baby!

17:10.397 --> 17:12.618
If you got it, flaunt it!

17:12.619 --> 17:17.804
Yolanda, you look like a queen.

17:25.757 --> 17:27.569
_

17:28.670 --> 17:30.559
Drag queen bingo?!

17:30.785 --> 17:34.454
Ladies and gentlemen, help
me welcome to the stage

17:34.488 --> 17:38.719
the Adam's apple of
everyone's eye, Miss Yolanda!

17:39.299 --> 17:40.974
Oh, hell no!

17:41.792 --> 17:43.325
Wait, Yolanda.

17:43.498 --> 17:47.063
You want me to pull balls? The
first balls I'm gonna pull are yours!

17:47.097 --> 17:50.833
- Yolanda! Yolanda!
- Listen to them, Yolanda.

17:50.867 --> 17:52.802
They love you.

17:52.836 --> 17:56.211
Yolanda! Yolanda! Yolanda! Yolanda!

17:56.212 --> 18:00.070
Well, they are chanting my name.

18:00.844 --> 18:04.212
So let's get this party started.

18:06.249 --> 18:09.373
- Let me hear you say "Hey!"
- Hey!

18:09.374 --> 18:13.210
The first ball of the night is...

18:13.665 --> 18:16.020
B-18.

18:16.021 --> 18:19.912
If you want a piece of
this, you better be 18!

18:19.913 --> 18:22.115
Hey!

18:22.232 --> 18:24.033
Hey!

18:30.279 --> 18:33.779
- Morgues?
- Morgues.

18:35.512 --> 18:37.546
Man, we sure can pick 'em.

18:37.581 --> 18:41.350
- Oh! We?
- Okay, fine. Me.

18:42.362 --> 18:43.570
Look...

18:44.854 --> 18:48.167
Gabi, you know we're not always going to
be dating people at the same exact time...

18:48.573 --> 18:51.531
Yeah, I know. I think I was just
trying to get us back to normal.

18:51.532 --> 18:53.759
You know, before all of that...

18:54.493 --> 18:55.799
"Sturff"?

18:57.009 --> 18:59.575
Yeah, "sturff."

19:00.130 --> 19:03.799
Well, look, sometimes "sturff" happens.

19:04.223 --> 19:06.429
And we gotta get past that.

19:06.654 --> 19:08.464
And you know what we have going for us?

19:08.553 --> 19:11.882
Ever since you started working for me, our
relationship's been anything but normal.

19:11.975 --> 19:16.378
So for us, normal is weird.

19:18.198 --> 19:20.649
And weird is normal.

19:21.503 --> 19:23.514
Z-z-z-oop.

19:25.221 --> 19:27.994
From now on, I think we
should just embrace the weird.

19:27.995 --> 19:29.998
The weird is what we need to embrace.

19:32.007 --> 19:34.275
- Morgues!
- Morgues!

19:35.410 --> 19:37.090
All right. See ya tomorrow, weirdo.

19:37.091 --> 19:38.478
Okay, bye, freak show.

19:39.485 --> 19:42.730
- Sup, bro?
- Embracing the weird.

19:44.935 --> 19:46.829
- Hey, Tyler.
- Hey, you.

19:46.830 --> 19:48.952
It's Thursday, so I was parked downstairs

19:48.953 --> 19:52.026
and I just couldn't get your pretty
little face out of my head all day,

19:52.027 --> 19:54.392
so I thought I'd come
up and see it in person.

19:57.974 --> 20:00.543
- You have to use the bathroom, don't you?
- So bad.

20:01.808 --> 20:04.433
Hey, do you have any more of those muffins?

20:05.588 --> 20:08.233
Embrace the weird.

20:17.642 --> 20:19.226
I should be mad at you.

20:19.282 --> 20:22.069
But I gotta admit, that was fun!

20:22.215 --> 20:25.217
It was a big surprise,
but you took it like a man.

20:25.261 --> 20:28.422
You sure did. You were amazing up there.

20:28.423 --> 20:31.335
- Oh, I was? Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

20:31.336 --> 20:34.857
- Can I buy you a drink?
- Mm... you can buy me two.

20:36.834 --> 20:40.874
So I'm clear, this guy's flirting with
me because he thinks I'm a man, right?

20:40.875 --> 20:42.914
Bingo!

20:44.142 --> 20:46.100
Hi, I'm Frank.
