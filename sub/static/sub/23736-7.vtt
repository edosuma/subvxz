19:26.533 --> 19:27.532
- Yeah...

19:27.534 --> 19:30.268
We all thought you were gonna
tell the cops, you know.

19:30.270 --> 19:32.737
- So we hired two
out of work actors

19:32.739 --> 19:36.340
to pretend to be cops.

19:36.342 --> 19:39.510
- So you could tell
them about, you know.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.779
- Ha! Gotcha.

19:41.781 --> 19:43.181
- I can't believe this!

19:43.183 --> 19:44.916
You guys tried to
make a fool outta me!

19:44.918 --> 19:49.220
- Yeah well
- Yup, that's true.

19:49.222 --> 19:50.888
- Well that's awful.

19:50.890 --> 19:51.923
And guess what Dub?!?

19:51.925 --> 19:55.526
I DIDN'T TELL those
fake cops what you did!

19:55.528 --> 19:57.195
But I sure am gonna
tell the real ones!

19:57.197 --> 20:00.398
- No Kenzie no, don't!
- Remember the taco!

20:00.600 --> 20:03.367
- Double G is the one
who knocked down his statue

20:03.369 --> 20:06.971
'cuz he didn't like it!
That's what happened!

20:06.973 --> 20:09.440
- Is that true Double G?

20:09.442 --> 20:11.909
- You knocked
down your statue?

20:11.911 --> 20:14.579
- Yeah. It's true.

20:14.581 --> 20:16.714
I did, so so
what's you gonna do?

20:16.716 --> 20:17.648
You gonna cuff me?

20:17.650 --> 20:19.850
- Pfff, what are you, kiddin'?

20:19.852 --> 20:20.651
You're Double G!

20:20.653 --> 20:22.653
- You don't have
to obey the law!

20:22.655 --> 20:25.289
You're a celebrity!

20:25.291 --> 20:26.524
- These are my kinda cops!

20:26.526 --> 20:27.959
- New York's finest!

20:27.961 --> 20:31.295
- Oh oh so the laws of
this country mean nothing?

20:31.297 --> 20:33.497
- No, laws are very important.

20:33.499 --> 20:34.999
- And you broke one.

20:35.001 --> 20:35.866
- What?

20:35.868 --> 20:37.768
- You knew that
Double G was the one

20:37.770 --> 20:38.970
who vandalized the statue.

20:38.972 --> 20:39.837
- She knew it.

20:39.839 --> 20:41.472
- And you didn't say anything.

20:41.474 --> 20:42.940
- Said nothin'

20:42.942 --> 20:44.642
- You're under arrest.

20:44.644 --> 20:45.977
- Wha--You can't arrest me.

20:45.979 --> 20:48.412
- Why not?
- Are you a celebrity?

20:48.414 --> 20:49.513
- Well, no.

20:49.515 --> 20:52.016
- Hands behind your back.

20:52.018 --> 20:55.019
- Awwww!
Geez louise!!

20:55.655 --> 20:57.388
- Wait, wait,
wait, wait WAIT!

20:57.390 --> 20:58.589
- No no--
it's okay, Babe.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.291
I'm glad they're
arresting me.

21:00.293 --> 21:02.860
Because I did do
something wrong.

21:02.862 --> 21:05.396
I saw a crime, and I
should've reported it.

21:05.398 --> 21:07.965
And even though I don't
wanna go to jail,

21:07.967 --> 21:08.933
at least this shows me

21:08.935 --> 21:11.469

about doing what's right.

21:11.471 --> 21:13.404
