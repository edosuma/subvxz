[Max] This is the city-- Spoonerville.

01:04.481 --> 01:08.902
This is the school, and this is me.

01:09.110 --> 01:11.571
My name's Max. I carry a badge.

01:11.654 --> 01:15.200
O.K., O.K. I didn't always have a badge.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.495
That day, all I had was three quarters

01:18.578 --> 01:21.247
and a serious problem named Tooth.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.458
Big for his age?

01:23.541 --> 01:26.252
This guy would've been
big for the Stone Age.

01:26.336 --> 01:29.756
His motto-- pay up or get beat up.

01:29.839 --> 01:31.174
Lunch money, allowance.

01:31.257 --> 01:34.761
He wasn't picky. Just so it was cash.

01:35.303 --> 01:37.889
But that day I had a plan.

01:38.390 --> 01:40.558
All I needed was my best friend P.J.

01:40.642 --> 01:44.646
and his kid sister. Her name was Pistol.

01:44.729 --> 01:46.022
Oh, boy, you guys, I can't hardly wait!

01:46.106 --> 01:47.941
This is gonna be
so much fun! I can't wait!

01:48.358 --> 01:50.026
Aw, this plan's stupid.

01:50.443 --> 01:52.445
That's O.K. So's he.

01:52.529 --> 01:54.114
[growls]

01:55.532 --> 01:57.450
So the doctor says "drink lots and lots

01:57.534 --> 01:59.285
and quarts and gallons of milk,

01:59.369 --> 02:01.371
and it'll help you grow."
but who would have guessed?

02:01.454 --> 02:03.039
Pistol, sit still.

02:03.456 --> 02:07.919
Hey, lardo,
where's your pal, the little goofball?

02:08.003 --> 02:09.170
Huh?

02:09.254 --> 02:12.090
[gulp] You mean the goofball

02:12.173 --> 02:15.093
whose money you always steal? Uh...

02:15.176 --> 02:16.761
Haven't seen him. Later.

02:17.846 --> 02:20.181
Yeah. Yeah, later, Tooth.

02:21.266 --> 02:23.601
So long, sucker. Oof!

02:24.519 --> 02:25.729
You can't do this

02:25.812 --> 02:27.772
every time that bully comes after you.

02:27.856 --> 02:29.274
Tell me about it.

02:29.357 --> 02:31.484
My dad ought to give him my allowance,

02:31.568 --> 02:33.028
cut out the middleman.

02:33.862 --> 02:39.284
Nah, that would take
all the fun out of it.

02:39.367 --> 02:41.745
This jerk needed to be taught a lesson.

02:42.245 --> 02:44.330
Nobody messes with a Goof...

02:44.414 --> 02:45.749
Except maybe Tooth,

02:45.832 --> 02:47.709
The-the kind of kid

02:47.792 --> 02:49.794
who started shaving in the first grade.

02:50.628 --> 02:53.214
O.K. I admit it. I needed...

02:53.298 --> 02:57.260
Help!

02:57.344 --> 02:59.137
Hang on. I'll get the safety.

02:59.554 --> 03:01.056
Melvin! Help!

03:01.139 --> 03:03.641
The Safety-- The Swift Sword of Justice,

03:03.725 --> 03:05.727
The long Arm of the law.

03:06.227 --> 03:07.312
[tweet]

03:08.188 --> 03:09.731
[growls]

03:10.648 --> 03:12.650
The only kid around more scared than me.

03:13.151 --> 03:15.320
I kissed my cash goodbye

03:15.403 --> 03:17.155
and said hello to the concrete.

03:17.238 --> 03:20.575
Another shakedown,
and nobody could stop it.

03:20.909 --> 03:23.995
Nobody except my partner P.J.--

03:24.371 --> 03:26.331
Pete Junior if you're nasty.

03:30.251 --> 03:33.922
You'd better give
my friend his m-money back,

03:34.005 --> 03:36.716
or I swear I'll-- I'll...

03:36.800 --> 03:42.138
Ooh, lardo, I'm real scared.

03:44.432 --> 03:45.767
You dropped one.

03:45.850 --> 03:48.103
It was the match-up of the century--

03:48.186 --> 03:50.438
Rump vs. Chump.

03:59.823 --> 04:01.282
Uh, Tooth?

04:01.366 --> 04:03.368
Aah!

04:05.370 --> 04:07.122
Who cares if it was an accident?

04:07.872 --> 04:10.417
It was still awesome.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.337
Way to go, Peej!

04:14.421 --> 04:17.382
Huh? Tooth must have
changed his mind, Max.

04:17.465 --> 04:20.260
-Here's your money.
-Don't you get what you did?

04:20.343 --> 04:22.679
P.J. beat the bully!

04:22.762 --> 04:25.515
♪ P.J. beat the bully,
P.J. beat the bully ♪

04:25.598 --> 04:27.350
I what?

04:27.434 --> 04:29.269
My big brother is a bully-bumper!

04:29.352 --> 04:30.687
Cheer him or fear him, folks!

04:30.770 --> 04:32.188
Cut it out, Pistol!

04:32.272 --> 04:34.107
I didn't beat up anybody!

04:34.190 --> 04:35.400
Beg to differ, pal.

04:35.483 --> 04:37.485
But I didn't mean to do it, man.

04:37.569 --> 04:40.238
Oh, I-I just want to go on record

04:40.321 --> 04:41.740
as being more than willing

04:41.823 --> 04:44.576
to both cheer and fear you, uh, sir--

04:44.659 --> 04:46.077
P.J., sir, sir.

04:46.161 --> 04:48.121
Ah Melvin, get a grip.

04:48.329 --> 04:50.081
Right, dude. Hands off the hero.

04:51.499 --> 04:53.752
Maybe it was the word "hero,"

04:53.835 --> 04:55.545
or maybe it was how Peej

04:55.628 --> 04:57.505
struck a blow for the little guy.

04:57.672 --> 04:59.674
But suddenly all I could think about

04:59.758 --> 05:01.509
was the battle for justice.

05:01.593 --> 05:04.429
And we were the heroes for the job.

05:04.512 --> 05:05.930
But first I had to convince

05:06.014 --> 05:07.682
the chief safety to let us join.

05:07.766 --> 05:11.102
He was a know-it-all
named Douglas Twinkmeyer.

05:11.186 --> 05:13.897
In gym class, they called him Twinkie,

05:14.147 --> 05:16.691
but here he called the shots.

05:16.816 --> 05:19.486
Yeah. Like there's really
a crime wave, right?

05:19.569 --> 05:22.155
Look, Chief! This racket is too organized!

05:22.238 --> 05:24.824
We all know that tooth is a total spud.

05:25.658 --> 05:28.161
I got a hunch somebody's
behind the scenes.

05:28.244 --> 05:30.747
A Mr., uh, a Mr...

05:30.830 --> 05:32.499
Mr. Big.

05:32.582 --> 05:34.125
Oh, hey, I just noticed--

05:34.209 --> 05:35.710
Don't need any more safeties.

05:35.919 --> 05:38.463
Oh, well, too bad. Maybe next year. Ciao.

05:38.546 --> 05:40.006
It's O.K., Max. I told you

05:40.090 --> 05:41.800
I only beat that bully by accident.

05:41.883 --> 05:43.968
I mean I probably couldn't
do that again to save--

05:44.052 --> 05:46.805
Unless we were official safeties.

05:46.888 --> 05:48.473
Tsk tsk. You know,

05:48.556 --> 05:50.975
I'm not so sure you two
are safety material.

05:51.059 --> 05:54.229
The force is made up of
spoonerville school's finest.

05:54.312 --> 05:57.107
The few, the proud, the--

05:57.190 --> 05:58.400
[Melvin] Hi, chief.

05:58.483 --> 06:01.695
Hmm. One look at that lineup of macho men

06:01.778 --> 06:04.489
told me they were no match for any bully.

06:04.572 --> 06:06.241
Hey, they were afraid of--

06:06.324 --> 06:09.577
Oh, the kid with the deadly rump.

06:10.453 --> 06:11.329
Deadly?

06:11.746 --> 06:12.997
Chill out, Melvin.

06:13.081 --> 06:15.250
Oh, yes, indeed, please do chill.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.669
These wannabes were just leaving.

06:17.752 --> 06:20.547
So the chief didn't think
we had what it takes.

06:20.964 --> 06:23.717
Time for a demolition demo.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.635
Peej, shoe's untied!

06:27.721 --> 06:28.763
Aah!

06:28.847 --> 06:31.016
Chief, wouldn't it be better

06:31.099 --> 06:33.601
to have him with us rather than again' us?

06:33.685 --> 06:35.729
O.K. O.K. Meeting adjourned.

06:35.812 --> 06:38.356
Report to Maple and Main
for your first assignment.

06:38.440 --> 06:39.774
Ohh!

06:39.858 --> 06:41.359
You won't regret this, Chief.

06:43.862 --> 06:46.781
Maple and Main-- our first assignment,

06:46.865 --> 06:48.116
and we were ready.

06:48.199 --> 06:50.035
O.K., kids, listen up.

06:50.118 --> 06:53.538
We stop, look both ways,

06:53.663 --> 06:56.458
then we cross single file.

06:56.541 --> 06:58.668
Aw, what a great assignment, Max.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.503
Did the chief realize

07:00.587 --> 07:03.631
he had stuck his two
best men in Dullsville?

07:04.257 --> 07:07.427
Oh, sure. P.J. said that he enjoyed this,

07:07.927 --> 07:10.055
but he meant that
crime fighting was in his blood.

07:10.138 --> 07:12.307
I just had to remind him.

07:12.390 --> 07:15.935
You want to hang out here, Peej? O.K.

07:16.561 --> 07:19.147
But think about the kid who can't buy milk

07:19.647 --> 07:21.566
'cause a bully stole his lunch money.

07:22.400 --> 07:25.278
You want to just hide here?
I don't blame ya.

07:25.779 --> 07:29.074
I guess that kid would hide, too,
if he could.

07:29.324 --> 07:31.910
Who's hiding? I'm ready!

07:31.993 --> 07:34.371
[sobbing] Ready as I'll ever be, anyway.

07:34.454 --> 07:37.624
So P.J. and I went down
to the local Pizza Palace

07:37.707 --> 07:39.709
to check out a few leads.

07:41.086 --> 07:43.421
[P.J.] Well, everything looks
under control here.

07:43.755 --> 07:46.216
-Let's call it a day.
-Not so fast, Peej.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.843
I smell a shakedown. Bingo!

07:49.260 --> 07:51.638
[grunts] Hey, poindexter,

07:51.763 --> 07:54.683
got a little business proposition for ya.

07:54.766 --> 07:56.935
Oh, I know. I know, Tooth.

07:57.018 --> 07:59.604
If I pay ya, ya won't beat me up?

07:59.688 --> 08:02.524
No, nothing like that.

08:02.607 --> 08:06.778
If you pay me, he won't beat you up.

08:06.861 --> 08:09.989
Meet my new pal Nails.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.577
Nice to meet you.

08:14.661 --> 08:15.829
They're not gonna get away with this!

08:15.912 --> 08:17.414
Right, Peej? Peej?

08:17.497 --> 08:21.376
Uh, well, I assumed my partner
was acting as a lookout

08:21.418 --> 08:22.794
to survey the battlefield

08:22.877 --> 08:24.254
and assess the enemy's weaknesses.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.839
Make a wish.

08:26.214 --> 08:28.925
Peej. Peej!

08:29.009 --> 08:30.760
[snap]

08:30.844 --> 08:32.095
Whoa!

08:33.513 --> 08:36.182
It's that lardo kid again!

08:36.266 --> 08:37.100
Whoa!

08:37.767 --> 08:39.769
He can't be human.

08:40.270 --> 08:43.606
That's why they call him the bumpinator.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.692
Aah!

08:45.817 --> 08:48.903
Whoa!

08:50.905 --> 08:52.407
[crash]

08:54.534 --> 08:56.369
I'm your worst nightmare--

08:56.703 --> 08:58.705
A Goof with a badge.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.749
That's it, Max! No more.

09:00.832 --> 09:02.625
I'm not cut out for this.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.669
Thanks for saving me, bumpinator.

09:04.753 --> 09:07.672
Have a pepperoni plus on me.

09:07.756 --> 09:09.758
Wow. Don't mind if I do!

09:10.467 --> 09:12.719
P.J. already had a taste for pepperoni.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.555
Now he was developing
a taste for crime fighting.

09:15.638 --> 09:17.640
[cheering]

09:17.724 --> 09:21.227
We were heroes. Correction, superheroes.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.396
O.K., O.K. We were legends.

09:23.480 --> 09:24.898
We were...

09:24.981 --> 09:26.608
Bumpinators! Bumpinators!

09:26.691 --> 09:29.569
Bumpinators! Bumpinators! Bumpinators!

09:29.652 --> 09:31.237
Y-You tell him.

09:31.321 --> 09:33.990
No way. You tell him.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.826
[Mr. Big] Tooth, Nails, boys.

09:38.370 --> 09:41.247
Listen, just leave the quarters
from the Arcade Job

09:41.331 --> 09:42.665
and boom, get outta here.

09:42.749 --> 09:47.045
Uh, had a little problem.

09:47.128 --> 09:49.130
What kind of... problem?

09:49.214 --> 09:52.467
[panting] It's those new safeties.

09:52.550 --> 09:55.387
Yeah. The B-b-b-b...

09:55.470 --> 09:57.555
-Bumpinators.
-Bumpinators?

09:57.639 --> 10:00.725
You two are the biggest,
toughest bullies in this school.

10:00.809 --> 10:03.311
You can't handle a couple
of rookie safeties?

10:04.020 --> 10:08.400
So Max and P.J. want
to turn up the heat, huh?

10:09.484 --> 10:13.571
Good. The time has come to play hardball.

10:13.655 --> 10:18.159
I want shakedowns every day all over town.

10:18.660 --> 10:22.414
And if the bumpinators get in our way,

10:23.081 --> 10:24.749
eliminate 'em.

10:27.919 --> 10:29.754
3:41 p.m.--

10:29.838 --> 10:33.425
P.J. and I were working the day watch
out of the after-school division.

10:33.508 --> 10:35.969
Uh, mobile after-school division.

10:36.052 --> 10:38.680
You see, I tricked out my old bike

10:38.763 --> 10:41.182
so my partner could rode shotgun.

10:41.266 --> 10:43.768
They told us that we couldn't
be everywhere at once.

10:44.436 --> 10:46.021
They were wrong.

10:46.104 --> 10:48.857
P.J. and I were patrolling,
keeping the peace.

10:48.940 --> 10:50.859
We came across a local donut shop.

10:50.942 --> 10:52.694
Hey, heroes got to eat, too.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.279
P.J. couldn't make up his mind

10:54.362 --> 10:56.698
between the powdered or the glazed donut.

10:56.781 --> 10:58.283
Just then, we heard a disturbance.

10:58.366 --> 10:59.826
[chatter]

11:02.579 --> 11:03.621
[burp]

11:04.456 --> 11:06.583
Cough it up, swivel neck.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.251
Drop him, Nails!

11:08.335 --> 11:10.462
Max! Tooth and Nails have wheels!

11:10.545 --> 11:12.130
I don't care if they have wings.

11:12.714 --> 11:14.799
Preying on a fellow champion of justice--

11:14.883 --> 11:17.093
No, sir! Not on my beat.

11:17.927 --> 11:21.306
[laughs] We call this the speed bump.

11:23.767 --> 11:26.770
Look out! Look out! The cart! Aah!

11:26.853 --> 11:28.605
Follow that cart!

11:30.190 --> 11:32.484
Aah! Aah!

11:48.541 --> 11:50.919
Seems they hadn't counted
on our nerves of steel

11:51.503 --> 11:53.088
or a bum wheel.

11:53.963 --> 11:57.008
Tooth got lucky, but Nails was ours--

11:57.092 --> 11:59.094
Right where he belonged.

12:00.595 --> 12:02.472
O.K., Nails, let's start with

12:02.555 --> 12:04.265
the easy questions.

12:04.599 --> 12:05.892
Lights, Peej.

12:06.935 --> 12:09.396
We borrowed a spotlight
from the boys in A.V.

12:09.646 --> 12:11.564
I had him right where I wanted him.

12:11.648 --> 12:15.110
Finally, I hit him with the big question.

12:15.193 --> 12:17.237
Who's Mr. Big?

12:17.320 --> 12:18.738
Wha-- wha--

12:18.822 --> 12:21.157
O.K., O.K.!

12:21.241 --> 12:22.367
I'll tell ya!

12:22.492 --> 12:24.411
Just please ask him to sit down!

12:27.163 --> 12:28.498
Mr. Big is--

12:32.043 --> 12:33.545
Talk about leads, P.J...

12:33.628 --> 12:35.505
The weapon! Even better,

12:35.588 --> 12:38.425
the gumslinger had a mondo gob
stuck to his shoe!

12:41.177 --> 12:42.262
What are you doing?

12:42.345 --> 12:45.724
Chief, we were this close
to nabbing Mr. Big!

12:45.807 --> 12:47.726
You're working too hard, safety.

12:48.184 --> 12:50.395
Take a few days' R & R.

12:50.478 --> 12:52.313
There's no time for reading and writing.

12:52.397 --> 12:55.066
We caught one of his goons!
Come on! He'll tell you!

12:55.150 --> 12:56.234
[P.J.] gone!

12:56.317 --> 12:57.736
We had Nails,

12:57.819 --> 12:59.571
and he was ready to spill his guts!

12:59.654 --> 13:01.072
Honest, Chief!

13:01.156 --> 13:03.116
The Chief knew we were on to something,

13:03.199 --> 13:04.993
and he was behind us all the way.

13:05.076 --> 13:06.995
Go home. Take a nap.

13:10.415 --> 13:13.209
As for Nails, I'd bet my allowance

13:13.293 --> 13:16.713
that Mr. Big had something
to do with springing him.

13:17.380 --> 13:20.633
Y-you wanted to see me, sir?

13:20.717 --> 13:22.886
I'm very disappointed

13:22.969 --> 13:25.722
that I had to get personally involved.

13:25.805 --> 13:29.476
Sir, you see, I-I can explain
about the store.

13:29.559 --> 13:31.478
It's those bumpinators!

13:31.895 --> 13:35.565
No self-repulsin' bully can have any fun!

13:36.232 --> 13:38.193
No matter. I have a way

13:38.276 --> 13:40.820
we can avoid making the same mistakes.

13:41.446 --> 13:44.240
You see, I possess all the quarters I need

13:44.324 --> 13:46.785
to begin phase two of my plan.

13:46.868 --> 13:48.328
Best of all,

13:48.411 --> 13:51.456
those meddling fools
can't do a thing about it!

13:51.539 --> 13:54.709
It'll all be perfectly legal.

13:54.793 --> 13:56.628
I will own this town!

13:59.756 --> 14:01.257
Here's all of the shakedowns.

14:01.383 --> 14:03.259
I just know we're missing something.

14:03.343 --> 14:04.552
-A pattern?
-Yeah.

14:04.636 --> 14:08.682
Listen. Why don't you two take five
and let me have a crack?

14:08.765 --> 14:10.558
It was great to see the Chief

14:10.642 --> 14:13.311
taking a personal interest
in our investigation.

14:13.395 --> 14:15.355
He found a pattern, all right--

14:15.438 --> 14:17.148
Southside Spoonerville,

14:17.440 --> 14:20.068
The corner of Bleak Street
and Nowhere Avenue.

14:20.860 --> 14:21.986
[munching]

14:24.155 --> 14:26.491
I said stakeout, not "pigout."

14:26.574 --> 14:30.620
You said to prepare
for a long night. [chomping]

14:30.745 --> 14:33.039
P.J. ate and ate, until finally...

14:33.123 --> 14:34.290
[snoring]

14:34.374 --> 14:35.500
Hey, hey!

14:35.583 --> 14:37.877
That was my last piece, man!

14:37.961 --> 14:39.963
Shh! Look. They got Melvin!

14:40.463 --> 14:41.381
Wow!

14:42.215 --> 14:43.883
Melvin's Mr. Big?

14:43.967 --> 14:46.720
No! It's a shakedown.

14:46.803 --> 14:47.887
All right!

14:47.971 --> 14:50.974
I got this new aerial maneuver
I've been working on.

14:52.183 --> 14:55.061
Maybe you ought to cut down
on the chocolate milk.

14:55.145 --> 14:57.397
Viva bumpinators!

14:57.480 --> 14:59.232
It was a perfect bust.

14:59.983 --> 15:01.401
Too bad there was no crime.

15:01.484 --> 15:03.236
Freeze! Where's Melvin?

15:03.319 --> 15:07.741
-Ugh! What... are... you... doing?
-Saving you.

15:07.824 --> 15:10.285
It wasn't a shakedown!

15:10.368 --> 15:13.455
I was just sellin' them my Lefty McGuffin.

15:13.538 --> 15:14.998
A baseball card?

15:15.081 --> 15:18.960
Huh. Yep. All nice and legal like.

15:19.502 --> 15:21.046
Lefty was a south paw pitcher

15:21.129 --> 15:22.756
for the Spoonerville Sparrows.

15:22.839 --> 15:25.008
Hardly all-star material, though.

15:25.091 --> 15:27.177
Heck, everybody had a Lefty.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.095
The card wasn't worth a dime.

15:29.179 --> 15:30.972
We paid him a quarter for it.

15:31.056 --> 15:33.475
[laughs] Hey-- hey, fellas.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.810
What do you say we just
forget about this whole thing?

15:35.894 --> 15:37.979
The front page of the
school paper said it all--

15:39.981 --> 15:41.733
"Renegade Safeties."

15:41.816 --> 15:43.610
Y-you wanted to see us, Chief?

15:43.693 --> 15:45.362
Read the news lately?

15:45.445 --> 15:47.322
What? You believe that rag?

15:47.405 --> 15:49.991
-I'm the editor!
-Oh.

15:50.075 --> 15:52.494
You two are a disgrace to this force!

15:52.577 --> 15:54.662
You don't deserve to wear these badges!

15:54.746 --> 15:57.332
No, no! You're not gonna--

15:57.415 --> 15:59.959
He did. Seemed to enjoy it, too.

16:00.043 --> 16:02.837
Oh, yes! Yes! Ha ha ha ha!

16:02.921 --> 16:05.215
Yesterday we were heroes.

16:05.298 --> 16:09.844
Today we're just a couple
of no-badge nobodies.

16:15.392 --> 16:18.395
I thought a little free pizza
might clear our minds.

16:18.853 --> 16:21.314
Surely we'd still be heroes
at the old haunt.

16:22.065 --> 16:23.650
Ow! That hurts.

16:23.733 --> 16:25.819
With the bumpinators badgeless,

16:25.902 --> 16:27.320
the bullies were free

16:27.404 --> 16:29.197
to resume their reign of terror.

16:29.280 --> 16:32.784
This line is for five Leftys or less only.

16:32.867 --> 16:36.454
Don't shove! We've got plenty
of quarters for everyone.

16:37.580 --> 16:39.207
All right, all right. They were treated

16:39.290 --> 16:40.834
like they were doing a public service

16:40.917 --> 16:42.711
buying up all those Lefty cards.

16:43.128 --> 16:44.462
P.J.!

16:45.255 --> 16:47.173
The reaction was always the same.

16:48.049 --> 16:50.885
Heck, Max, everybody's got a Lefty.

16:51.720 --> 16:55.015
This stunk like last week's lunch
in the back of your locker.

16:55.098 --> 16:57.100
Nobody would look at us.
Nobody would talk to us.

16:57.183 --> 17:00.103
Nobody would... Buy us pizza. [sighs]

17:01.021 --> 17:02.772
It just doesn't add up.

17:03.231 --> 17:05.108
Yeah. You think we would've gotten

17:05.191 --> 17:07.694
one more freebie for old times' sake, huh?

17:07.777 --> 17:11.865
No! I mean, why would the bullies
swipe all those quarters

17:11.948 --> 17:14.784
just to buy the world's most
worthless baseball card?

17:14.868 --> 17:17.203
P.J.'s a star! P.J.'s a star!
Look! Check it out!

17:17.287 --> 17:18.288
Look at this!

17:18.371 --> 17:19.914
Can't you see we're moping?

17:19.998 --> 17:22.375
But lookie, lookie!
Douglas got your good side.

17:23.126 --> 17:24.461
Douglas?

17:24.544 --> 17:27.797
Douglas Twinkmeyer, the school newspaper's
editor-in-chief

17:27.881 --> 17:31.343
and reporter, copy boy,

17:31.509 --> 17:34.137
astrologer, photographer!

17:34.220 --> 17:36.431
"Picture by D. Twinkmeyer."

17:36.514 --> 17:38.683
Douglas took that picture?

17:38.892 --> 17:40.602
W-What was he doing in that alley?

17:41.394 --> 17:44.314
Yeah! What was he doing in that alley?

17:44.814 --> 17:47.650
Unless it was a set-up!

17:49.611 --> 17:53.114
It hit me with the force of
a Monday morning pop quiz--

17:53.990 --> 17:56.743
Twinkmeyer's odd reluctance

17:56.826 --> 17:58.620
to accept us as the ultimate

17:58.703 --> 18:00.330
crime-fighting force...

18:01.456 --> 18:02.916
The bubble gum trail

18:02.999 --> 18:06.169
that led to the coincidental encounter
at his locker...

18:07.295 --> 18:08.505
His so-called "help"

18:09.005 --> 18:11.508
in choosing the location for our stakeout.

18:12.842 --> 18:15.053
Douglas Twinkmeyer is Mr. Big!

18:16.262 --> 18:18.056
Oh, yeah, right.

18:18.139 --> 18:20.892
I mean, he's the most respected kid
in school!

18:20.975 --> 18:23.728
You can't accuse the Chief
of the Safety Force!

18:24.396 --> 18:26.439
I'm not a safety anymore, Peej.

18:27.357 --> 18:29.609
Now it's... personal.

18:32.237 --> 18:33.488
[rattling doorknob]

18:33.822 --> 18:36.449
Oh, you best be right about this, Max.

18:39.828 --> 18:41.037
Aha!

18:41.371 --> 18:43.498
You are Mr. Big!

18:44.666 --> 18:45.667
Touche.

18:45.750 --> 18:47.335
Too bad no one will believe you.

18:47.419 --> 18:50.755
I am the most respected kid
In school, after all.

18:51.256 --> 18:52.757
Lunch money was bad enough,

18:52.841 --> 18:55.760
but messing with baseball cards--
This is low.

18:56.344 --> 18:57.262
Look familiar?

18:57.345 --> 18:58.972
A Lefty McGuffin.

18:59.055 --> 19:01.057
So? Everybody's got one.

19:01.141 --> 19:03.226
Oh, really? Where's yours?

19:03.560 --> 19:05.562
I-I sold it... to him.

19:06.312 --> 19:07.147
Oh.

19:07.230 --> 19:11.401
Aw, don't you get it, Peej?
He's cornered the market!

19:11.484 --> 19:13.945
Hey, so quick for a Goof.

19:14.195 --> 19:15.321
Pity you're too late.

19:15.405 --> 19:16.823
What's that supposed to mean?

19:16.906 --> 19:18.533
That you're not on time.

19:18.950 --> 19:20.493
I take back what i said about "quick."

19:21.494 --> 19:24.080
So you got a ton of Lefty cards.

19:24.164 --> 19:25.749
Try one...

19:25.832 --> 19:28.209
One very valuable rarity.

19:28.626 --> 19:29.669
You wouldn't!

19:29.753 --> 19:30.628
Perhaps not...

19:31.212 --> 19:33.048
But my mother would.

19:33.381 --> 19:35.383
Let me paint you a little picture.

19:36.468 --> 19:38.553
The laundroplex...Mom...

19:38.636 --> 19:40.347
The leftys...

19:40.597 --> 19:45.310
And a heavy-duty large-capacity
washing machine.

19:45.393 --> 19:47.103
Heh heh heh heh.

19:47.187 --> 19:48.355
At any moment,

19:48.438 --> 19:51.775
the cards will be washed, rinsed,

19:51.941 --> 19:57.197
and agitated into oblivion! Ha ha ha!

19:57.280 --> 20:01.659
His plot sickened me
worse than liveroni day in the school caf.

20:05.413 --> 20:06.623
Stop them!

20:13.421 --> 20:14.923
Mrs. Twinkmeyer?

20:15.590 --> 20:17.384
The Leftys! The Leftys!

20:20.428 --> 20:22.764
Ha ha ha ha ha.

20:22.847 --> 20:25.100
Try the back door next time.

20:25.433 --> 20:27.185
[Max] you disgust me, Twinkie.

20:27.602 --> 20:30.855
Ah! That's a cheap shot, mister!

20:30.939 --> 20:33.149
What kind of spineless wimp

20:33.233 --> 20:35.902
hides behind somebody else's brawn?

20:35.985 --> 20:36.986
Get 'em, Peej.

20:39.072 --> 20:41.408
Ball Bannanars away!

20:41.491 --> 20:43.410
[crash]

20:49.040 --> 20:50.041
[Max] Yep.

20:50.125 --> 20:51.626
Don't worry, Twinkie--

20:51.710 --> 20:53.378
They'll be ready by Monday.

20:53.461 --> 20:54.462
Take 'em, Peej.

20:55.171 --> 20:56.881
Slight problem here.

20:57.382 --> 20:58.550
I'm stuck!

20:58.633 --> 21:01.803
Lose something... Like your nerve?

21:01.886 --> 21:03.930
But without P.J., how could I--

21:04.014 --> 21:07.392
That's when I realized we were a team

21:07.475 --> 21:09.269
and now it was my turn.

21:10.687 --> 21:12.564
Douglas, your mother's calling you!

21:12.814 --> 21:13.732
Mommy?

21:16.234 --> 21:17.318
Ha!

21:17.402 --> 21:19.487
My Leftys! Nooooo!

21:22.782 --> 21:24.659
Yes! They're mine!

21:25.535 --> 21:27.454
This is not fair!

21:27.537 --> 21:28.621
[glub]

21:28.705 --> 21:29.998
When the suds cleared...

21:30.665 --> 21:33.960
The baseball cards were A-O.K.

21:34.669 --> 21:36.087
[kids cheering]

21:36.671 --> 21:38.965
Peej and I were heroes again

21:39.049 --> 21:40.759
and back on the force.

21:40.842 --> 21:42.594
Tooth and Nails were sentenced

21:42.677 --> 21:45.180
to two weeks of hard time
in detention hall,
