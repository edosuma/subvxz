00:40.227 --> 00:42.495
Tess.

00:42.496 --> 00:45.398
Your air mattress
is deflating again.

00:45.399 --> 00:47.533
Okay.

00:47.534 --> 00:50.069
Have you seen my other shoe?

00:50.070 --> 00:52.505
It's hiding from you. Wants
you to come back to bed.

00:52.506 --> 00:54.674
As tempting as that sounds,

00:54.675 --> 00:57.410
I have to go somewhere where there's
air conditioning before I melt.

00:57.411 --> 01:00.213
You know, we can solve
this really easily

01:00.214 --> 01:02.983
if we just moved in together.

01:05.486 --> 01:07.153
It's been six months, Tess.

01:07.154 --> 01:10.456
I'm ready for a
bigger commitment.

01:10.457 --> 01:14.528
Rodney, you can't even find
time to name your goldfish.

01:21.435 --> 01:24.470
Found it. All right. One more
kiss for the road. Come on.

01:24.471 --> 01:26.239
Get over here! No...

01:26.240 --> 01:29.075
I can't!

01:29.076 --> 01:31.945
I hato go. No, look,
I'm letting you go.

01:31.946 --> 01:34.047
Look, this is me letting you go.
Come here.

01:34.048 --> 01:36.082
Oh, my God. What?

01:36.083 --> 01:38.686
Morning breath! Ohh!

01:40.187 --> 01:42.488
That's your cue. Yeah.

01:42.489 --> 01:46.260
Why don't you put it in
the same spot every time?

01:49.129 --> 01:51.197
Got it.

01:51.198 --> 01:53.232
That is for... Job.

01:53.233 --> 01:54.734
Job interview.

01:54.735 --> 01:58.204
Holy shit. I can do this.
Okay, help me up. Help me up.

Oh! Hey, little man. Sorry about that.
It's no trouble.

02:42.316 --> 02:44.584
But I do need an
update about the rent.

02:44.585 --> 02:48.021
We need one of those three
back-payments pronto.

02:48.022 --> 02:51.057
One more week, I promise. Please...
lock the door.

02:51.058 --> 02:52.291
Oh!

02:52.292 --> 02:55.294
Sorry about that.
Thanks, Charlie.

02:55.295 --> 02:57.430
And I don't know if a
week is going to cut it.

02:57.431 --> 03:00.199
Mom was using all sorts
of colorful language

03:00.200 --> 03:04.203
this morning to describe you,
and none of it was good.

03:04.204 --> 03:06.739
Five days, then. I'm on my
way to a job interview now.

03:06.740 --> 03:10.043
Even if you get a job, you
probably won't get your paycheck

03:10.044 --> 03:11.711
until two weeks from now.

03:11.712 --> 03:14.380
Good point. We'll figure it out.

03:14.381 --> 03:17.216
I'll talk to her. It'd
be a shame to lose you.

03:17.217 --> 03:19.819
Yes. Say that, plus other
nice things about me.

03:19.820 --> 03:23.322
I don't care if they're lies.
Just make 'em nice.

03:23.323 --> 03:25.563
Very odd that you're always
working in that little bunker.

03:25.587 --> 03:28.156
Good luck! Thank you!

03:29.496 --> 03:31.831
Open, door.

03:31.832 --> 03:35.335
Oh, got to get you fixed.
Yes, I do.

04:43.303 --> 04:45.471
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

04:45.472 --> 04:47.807
Phil brought in steak
fajitas for casual Friday,

04:47.808 --> 04:50.810
so I wanted to get in there
before the interns ravaged them.

04:50.811 --> 04:53.312
They smell delicious.
I'm Rodney.

04:53.313 --> 04:55.548
Susan.

04:55.549 --> 04:59.652
So, according to this résumé,

04:59.653 --> 05:02.421
the longest job you've
held is six weeks.

05:02.422 --> 05:04.624
Well, technically
it was nine weeks,

05:04.625 --> 05:09.362
but they were two-day weeks
for, like, five hours a day.

05:09.363 --> 05:12.498
And the one before that? A week?

05:12.499 --> 05:15.301
It was a 60-hour week.

05:15.302 --> 05:17.537
Look, before we get into...

05:17.538 --> 05:19.672
office politics,

05:19.673 --> 05:22.575
can we talk... salary

05:22.576 --> 05:25.411
or s... I don't think
we're there yet.

05:25.412 --> 05:28.181
No, no. I don't mean to
just zoom into that,

05:28.182 --> 05:31.284
but, you know, obviously
I was thinking 60. Thou?

05:31.285 --> 05:32.585
Thou? ..sand.

05:32.586 --> 05:34.320
Sand. Like, thousand?

05:34.321 --> 05:37.423
Like, thousand.

05:37.424 --> 05:41.294
No, I'm a reasonable guy. I'm
willing to negotiate by a few.

05:41.295 --> 05:43.196
"A few"?

05:43.197 --> 05:46.767
Few. I don't want to
undersell myself.

05:48.502 --> 05:50.403
Wait.

05:50.404 --> 05:53.540
Did Danny set you up for this?

05:54.575 --> 05:56.475
Who's Danny?

05:56.476 --> 05:58.477
You don't have a college degree,

05:58.478 --> 06:00.546
and you don't have any experience,
and this is an assistant position.

06:00.547 --> 06:03.449
I was shocked that you guys
called me in, too, a little bit.

06:03.450 --> 06:06.819
I mean, an "assistant CEO"
sounds really important.

06:06.820 --> 06:09.522
Assistant to the CEO. "To."

06:09.523 --> 06:12.083
No, no, I'm pretty sure the guy on
the phone said "assistant CEO."

06:12.107 --> 06:15.494
Okay, that would be my current
assistant, right there.

06:15.495 --> 06:19.699
Oh. We got eye contact.
Just ignore him. Hmm?

06:19.700 --> 06:22.868
Look at me. Don't look back Don't look...
You need somethin'?

06:22.869 --> 06:24.604
Hello?

06:24.605 --> 06:26.405
Just look at me. Don't look back.
Okay.

06:26.406 --> 06:28.976
If we stay still long
enough, he will go away.

06:32.512 --> 06:34.480
Can you hear me?

06:34.481 --> 06:36.016
Susan?

06:37.317 --> 06:39.386
Susan!

06:40.487 --> 06:42.421
Susan, can you hear me?

06:42.422 --> 06:44.323
Every day.

06:44.324 --> 06:45.625
Susan!

06:45.626 --> 06:48.395
Harry, don't you
have work to do?

06:49.796 --> 06:51.497
No.

06:51.498 --> 06:53.532
What else would be the
point of casual Fridays?

06:53.533 --> 06:55.502
Fuck this job.

06:56.737 --> 06:59.372
Is that who I'm
competing against?

06:59.373 --> 07:02.008
Essentially. I am...

07:02.009 --> 07:04.578
liking my chances.

07:06.313 --> 07:09.315
Well, I don't intend on replacing
one idiot with another.

07:09.316 --> 07:12.285
Right, right. Oh,
Jesus, he's back.

07:12.286 --> 07:14.887
Hey, I spilled coffee
on the copier.

07:14.888 --> 07:18.592
It's busted. That's on me.

07:22.562 --> 07:25.999
Is now a good time to
talk salary, or...

07:32.973 --> 07:35.875
Do you have any
bartending experience?

07:35.876 --> 07:38.044
Personally, I have a lot more

07:38.045 --> 07:41.782
bar-attending experience.

07:42.783 --> 07:44.717
Oh, come on. That was funny.

07:44.718 --> 07:46.852
Okay, let's try this again.

07:46.853 --> 07:50.523
How do you make a, uh, mojito?

07:50.524 --> 07:53.326
Tequi... Gin.

07:53.327 --> 07:55.061
Rum.

07:55.062 --> 07:57.330
And... other stuff.

07:57.331 --> 07:59.565
I'm more of a
whiskey fan myself.

07:59.566 --> 08:02.668
All right, so, uh, how do
you make a whiskey sour?

08:02.669 --> 08:07.540
Whiskey, whiskey, and a jealous ex-lover.
Am I right?

08:07.541 --> 08:09.476
'Cause it's sour?

08:10.811 --> 08:13.012
Okay, I'm going to get going.

08:13.013 --> 08:17.483
I got a, uh, massage
in 15 minutes.

08:17.484 --> 08:19.518
It's one of those...

08:19.519 --> 08:21.387
you know.

08:21.388 --> 08:25.624
Ugh. That kind where they walk
on your back with bare feet?

08:25.625 --> 08:27.928
I'll be in touch.

08:38.905 --> 08:41.539
Hey, hey!

08:41.541 --> 08:43.409
Hey.

08:43.409 --> 08:45.879
How'd that one go?
Did you get it?

08:51.885 --> 08:55.488
Practically gave it
to me on the spot.

08:55.489 --> 08:57.591
What?

08:59.726 --> 09:02.762
Congratulations! I
am so proud of you!

09:02.763 --> 09:04.563
Oh, it wasn't anything.

09:04.564 --> 09:06.966
Oh, it's so good!
I'm so impressed!

09:06.967 --> 09:10.569
So, what's... what's this?
Are we celebrating?

09:10.570 --> 09:13.706
Oh, it's just a
little this and that.

09:13.707 --> 09:15.608
Here.

09:15.609 --> 09:18.611
Oh, yeah. Cheers.

09:18.612 --> 09:21.514
Oh, I can get you... a glass.

09:21.515 --> 09:23.649
Oh, God, that's good.
Slow down, slow down.

09:23.650 --> 09:25.051
It's really good.

09:31.124 --> 09:33.560
There you go.

09:36.730 --> 09:39.031
All right, put the
money in the bag!

09:39.032 --> 09:41.200
Oh, shit. Don't shoot.

09:41.201 --> 09:43.702
Yeah, hurry up, or I'll
blow your brains out! No.

09:43.703 --> 09:46.605
Look, do as I say, and
no one gets hu...

09:46.606 --> 09:48.674
Holy shit, you're huge.

09:48.675 --> 09:52.978
Billy Coburn? Is that you?

09:52.979 --> 09:55.648
No. Just step the hell back.

09:55.649 --> 09:57.516
Hell, hell, hell.

09:57.517 --> 09:59.919
I'd recognize that
voice anywhere.

09:59.920 --> 10:03.122
This boy used to be
the best soprano.

10:03.123 --> 10:04.957
St. Matt's choir ever had.

10:04.958 --> 10:07.860
Till he hit puberty,
and then down he went.

10:07.861 --> 10:10.629
Now he's with the tenors.

10:10.630 --> 10:12.232
Damn it, June.

10:14.100 --> 10:16.836
Excuse me.

10:16.837 --> 10:19.772
I'm sorry. Mrs. Fleming.
I'm sorry.

10:19.773 --> 10:22.608
That's better.

10:22.609 --> 10:24.210
Your poor mother

10:24.211 --> 10:26.679
would be puking in her grave if
she knew what you were up to.

10:26.680 --> 10:29.081
Explain yourself. I'm sorry, Mrs.
Fleming.

10:29.082 --> 10:31.116
It's just, you know Claudia?

10:31.117 --> 10:33.652
She's pregnant again, and
it's twins this time.

10:33.653 --> 10:36.689
Aren't you the stud. Thank you.

10:36.690 --> 10:39.625
But it's just, how am
I supposed to feed

10:39.626 --> 10:42.027
my entire family on a
kindergarten teacher's salary?

10:42.028 --> 10:44.697
You know? And then my dad's
disability ran out...

10:44.698 --> 10:48.801
This is not the way, Billy.

10:48.802 --> 10:50.836
I know. Damn straight you know.

10:50.837 --> 10:54.773
Okay, now, you just get
your kiester home.

10:54.774 --> 10:57.710
You're... You're not
gonna call the...

10:57.711 --> 11:00.679
No, Chad's not going to call the cops.
Are you, Chad?

11:00.680 --> 11:02.615
Yes, the hell I am.

11:02.616 --> 11:05.217
Let's try that again.

11:05.218 --> 11:08.921
You're not going to
call the cops on this

11:08.922 --> 11:13.827
downtrodden, very loyal
husband and father.

11:15.562 --> 11:16.829
Chad?

11:16.830 --> 11:18.264
No. Louder.

11:18.265 --> 11:19.865
No.

11:19.866 --> 11:22.735
Thank you. Thank you.

11:22.736 --> 11:24.737
Don't you ever let me hear

11:24.738 --> 11:27.706
that you're involved in this
sort of shit again, okay?

11:27.707 --> 11:30.076
Yes, ma'am. 'Cause if I do,

11:32.779 --> 11:34.780
my hand is going to go

11:34.781 --> 11:37.316
so far up your ass,

11:37.317 --> 11:39.785
I'm going to be able
to pull out your teeth

11:39.786 --> 11:42.154
one by one.

11:42.155 --> 11:44.657
Got it? Yes, ma'am.

11:44.658 --> 11:45.992
All right. Now get.

11:50.797 --> 11:53.599
You know I could've
taken him, right?

11:53.600 --> 11:55.835
You can get the next one.

12:11.217 --> 12:13.185
Good morning, my working man.

12:13.186 --> 12:15.467
You'd better get up and get going.
You're going to be late.

12:15.491 --> 12:17.957
Late for what?

12:17.958 --> 12:19.792
Uh, your new job.

12:19.793 --> 12:22.728
Oh. Right.

12:22.729 --> 12:24.096
Yeah, yeah.

12:24.097 --> 12:26.332
Late on my first day?
That'd be bad.

12:26.333 --> 12:28.300
Listen...

12:28.301 --> 12:30.769
I, uh, I got to get going.
I'm going to be late.

12:30.770 --> 12:33.005
You good? Yeah.

12:33.006 --> 12:35.374
Okay. Lock the door
on your way out.

12:35.375 --> 12:37.077
Yeah.

12:53.860 --> 12:56.695
Hey, neighbor. How you been?

12:56.696 --> 13:01.066
It's great to see you out
and about this morning.

13:01.067 --> 13:03.936
Listen, I never got
your response back

13:03.937 --> 13:05.738
regarding reinstating
neighborhood watch.

13:05.739 --> 13:08.874
I sent a few letters out
but never heard back. Oh.

13:08.875 --> 13:11.944
It probably got lost in the mail.
It doesn't matter.

13:11.945 --> 13:14.813
I got another form for you.

13:14.814 --> 13:17.750
Right. Uh, I'll file that.

13:17.751 --> 13:19.184
Fantastic.

13:19.185 --> 13:22.955
Oh, and I couldn't help
but notice your yard.

13:22.956 --> 13:24.957
I got to be honest, June,

13:24.958 --> 13:28.328
it's seen better days...
Even months.

13:30.930 --> 13:32.331
Is that all, Woody?

13:32.332 --> 13:35.100
I mean, curb appeal is
important, you know?

13:35.101 --> 13:37.202
And we don't want
the property values

13:37.203 --> 13:39.204
in this neighborhood going down.

13:39.205 --> 13:41.874
I mean, look, the-the bushes

13:41.875 --> 13:44.143
out there in front,
they're growing so tall.

13:44.144 --> 13:46.679
Those should just be trimmed.
Uh-huh.

13:46.680 --> 13:49.782
So that, you know, you want
people to see your house.

13:49.783 --> 13:52.384
Like right over here,
this is all so dry.

13:52.385 --> 13:56.088
Used to be all lilies, and now
it looks like Afghanistan.

13:56.089 --> 13:59.425
And the geraniums are...

13:59.426 --> 14:01.994
desperately trying
to stay alive.

14:01.995 --> 14:04.063
And, I don't know,

14:04.064 --> 14:06.065
my heart just breaks for 'em.

14:06.066 --> 14:09.935
Your heart breaks for them?

14:09.936 --> 14:11.937
And...

14:11.938 --> 14:14.840
your bougainvilleas on this wall are dead.
That needs to be...

14:14.841 --> 14:18.143
What is the matter with you? Do
you have Asperger's or some shit?

14:18.144 --> 14:21.714
I mean, can you not read

14:21.715 --> 14:23.983
the writing on my face?

14:24.984 --> 14:28.420
Get the fuck away from me.

14:28.421 --> 14:30.989
You don't care about me,
I don't care about you,

14:30.990 --> 14:32.791
so you have a great
day, and I won't.

14:32.792 --> 14:34.326
Well, I hope...
Thanks for the paper.

14:34.327 --> 14:36.762
I hope you do have a great day.

14:36.763 --> 14:38.330
And, you know,

14:38.331 --> 14:42.000
remember, if you see
something, say something.

14:42.001 --> 14:45.038
Woody. I see something.

14:46.039 --> 14:47.874
I see a jackass.

14:49.442 --> 14:52.378
You don't have to be
such a twat, June.

14:53.980 --> 14:55.949
You're a twat.

14:59.185 --> 15:02.989
A delight, as always, Woody.

16:20.066 --> 16:22.301
You've reached the Flemings,

16:22.302 --> 16:25.170
Jim and June, and we're
not here right now.

16:25.171 --> 16:27.172
Leave a message. We'll
get back to ya.

16:27.173 --> 16:29.976
Not a long one though. Bye.

16:31.544 --> 16:35.514
Mom, are you there and
just not picking up?

16:35.515 --> 16:37.482
Damn straight.

16:37.483 --> 16:40.018
Mom, I'm... I'm
worried about you.

16:40.019 --> 16:43.322
You haven't returned my call in...
in weeks,

16:43.323 --> 16:45.591
and I have no idea
what's going on.

16:45.592 --> 16:48.594
Call me, okay?

16:48.595 --> 16:50.630
I love you.

17:07.213 --> 17:10.582
Hey, dude.

17:10.583 --> 17:13.319
Either buy something or get out.

17:26.266 --> 17:28.400
I'll take a regular
cup of coffee.

17:28.401 --> 17:30.202
Our medium is a grande.

17:30.203 --> 17:32.471
Did you want to do a grande?
That's fine.

17:32.472 --> 17:35.507
Uh, what else? That's it.

17:35.508 --> 17:39.611
Uh, we have a $10 minimum here.
The free Wi-Fi.

17:39.612 --> 17:43.315
That doesn't make sense. I'll
have a brownie. Good choice.

17:43.316 --> 17:45.183
Oh, you made it. 12.50.

17:45.184 --> 17:46.985
12.50? Mm-hmm.

17:46.986 --> 17:50.423
For a medium cup of coffee
and a brownie? Exactly.

17:56.496 --> 17:59.499
That one got declined. Hmm.

18:01.367 --> 18:03.168
Let's try this one.

18:03.169 --> 18:06.039
Also declined.

18:11.077 --> 18:13.178
Third time's a charm.

18:13.179 --> 18:15.648
No.

18:16.549 --> 18:18.150
This is fun. We could
do this all day.

18:18.151 --> 18:19.484
Can you guys taper this off?

18:19.485 --> 18:21.620
I got to teach a spin
class down the street.

18:21.621 --> 18:23.522
You need to wait your turn, sir.

18:23.523 --> 18:26.191
And are we done here, or
you got anything else?

18:26.192 --> 18:29.161
How about a... free refill?

18:29.162 --> 18:32.097
You didn't pay for that.
Fuck you.

18:32.098 --> 18:35.233
Hey, bud, you
forgot your laptop.

18:35.234 --> 18:39.171
Hey, you forgot your laptop!

18:39.172 --> 18:43.675
You forgot your computer!

18:43.676 --> 18:47.513
Fuck you... I don't even care. I'm
going to steal that computer.

19:00.293 --> 19:02.361
How's the bread?

19:02.362 --> 19:05.230
Mm. Good. You want?

19:05.231 --> 19:08.166
No. I had a big breakfast.

19:08.167 --> 19:11.136
Then why invite me to lunch?

19:11.137 --> 19:13.772
Well, because there's a few
things we have to talk about.

19:13.773 --> 19:17.376
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wait, wait.
Let me guess.

19:17.377 --> 19:20.245
You're worried about me.

19:20.246 --> 19:22.381
Well, yes. Mm-hmm.

19:22.382 --> 19:25.350
Uh, you think I'm not taking care
of myself since your dad died.

19:25.351 --> 19:27.619
Am I right?

19:27.620 --> 19:30.522
And the house, it's in a
complete disarray... Oh, Ollie.

19:30.523 --> 19:32.657
Your dad was the neat freak.

19:32.658 --> 19:35.527
To tell you the truth,
he was a little OCD.

19:35.528 --> 19:39.032
I'm, uh, more, uh, CGS.

19:40.366 --> 19:42.568
"Could give a shit."

19:44.137 --> 19:47.205
I am sorry I have not been
over as much as I used to,

19:47.206 --> 19:50.409
but I am putting in 60 hours
a week in the hospital.

19:50.410 --> 19:53.278
It's too much, Ollie.

19:53.279 --> 19:57.249
Take care of yourself, huh? I
mean, even God took a day off.

19:57.250 --> 19:59.284
God didn't have you as a mother.

19:59.285 --> 20:01.354
Just let someone help you.

20:03.222 --> 20:05.624
I'll think about it.

20:05.625 --> 20:08.261
Okay? Promise.

20:11.330 --> 20:13.332
Son of a...

20:20.373 --> 20:24.409
I feel like I'm just
floating by, you know?

20:24.410 --> 20:26.445
One day I want to do this.

20:26.446 --> 20:30.382
Next day it's something else.

20:30.383 --> 20:32.417
I guess I just need
some guidance.

20:32.418 --> 20:35.220
Go with your gut.

20:35.221 --> 20:38.790
Right now, all my gut's
saying is "feed me."

20:38.791 --> 20:41.793
Maybe you should get a
job at a restaurant.

20:41.794 --> 20:45.497
So, what do you want to
do when you grow up?

20:45.498 --> 20:48.834
Eh, in this economy,
hard to say right now.

20:48.835 --> 20:51.304
Got to see how it plays out.

20:53.106 --> 20:55.240
That makes sense.

20:55.241 --> 20:58.844
With that being said, I ran
the numbers with my mom,

20:58.845 --> 21:00.846
and we can't swing it, Rodney.

21:00.847 --> 21:04.250
It's time to move out, ASAP.

21:08.254 --> 21:10.322
I appreciate you
going to bat for me.

21:10.323 --> 21:12.190
No problem.

21:12.191 --> 21:16.228
By the way, you need
a new carburetor.

21:16.229 --> 21:19.198
May have to downgrade
to Rollerblades.

21:39.819 --> 21:41.454
Hello.

21:44.457 --> 21:46.359
Tessie?

21:51.330 --> 21:53.765
Shh! Tess?

21:53.766 --> 21:57.502
Your new roommate's here.

21:57.503 --> 21:59.437
♪ Your roommate is here ♪

21:59.438 --> 22:01.406
♪ Your roommate is here ♪

22:01.407 --> 22:04.676
♪ Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Where is my Tessie? ♪

22:04.677 --> 22:07.846
Tess?

22:07.847 --> 22:11.283
Jeez, Rodney, what... what
the hell are you doing?

22:11.284 --> 22:14.352
To what do I owe this...
pleasure?

22:14.353 --> 22:17.389
What's going on? Why-Why is
your stuff here? What...

22:17.390 --> 22:21.426
I thought me and this little guy
could come over for a talk.

22:21.427 --> 22:24.262
Maybe a fresh start.

22:24.263 --> 22:28.534
Is the pizza already here? Oh, man,
you are one fast delivery guy.

22:30.503 --> 22:34.206
Wait. Where's... Where's the pizza?
Who's this guy?

22:34.207 --> 22:37.343
Rodney... No! Eh,
eh, eh, eh-eh, eh!

22:38.778 --> 22:41.513
Who the hell are you?
Who the hell are you?!

22:41.514 --> 22:43.316
I'm Keith.

22:46.452 --> 22:48.353
I'm sorry, but...

22:48.354 --> 22:50.522
is this some sort
of a sick joke?

22:50.523 --> 22:52.424
Just shut up!

22:52.425 --> 22:55.894
God, you give me such
a headache sometimes!

22:55.895 --> 22:58.431
So you're really
not the pizza guy?

23:00.499 --> 23:03.501
Look.

23:03.502 --> 23:06.571
Maybe this is some
sort of a weird...

23:06.572 --> 23:09.241
speed bump in our relationship

23:09.242 --> 23:10.809
that soon will pass.

23:10.810 --> 23:14.546
No, Rodney. It's
not a speed bump.

23:14.547 --> 23:17.616
Think of it as a
permanent road closure.

23:17.617 --> 23:20.686
What? Sorry, dude.

23:25.891 --> 23:30.262
How long has this...
fling been going on?

23:30.263 --> 23:33.798
Five months. We have only
been dating for six months.

23:33.799 --> 23:36.702
What do you want me to say?

23:45.411 --> 23:46.878
Look, Rodney, I...

23:46.879 --> 23:48.880
I can't keep taking care of you.

23:48.881 --> 23:52.284
I need to be provided for,
and Keith is responsible.

23:52.285 --> 23:54.953
He's a pilot. She
breached the cockpit.

23:54.954 --> 23:56.688
He literally takes care of

23:56.689 --> 23:58.857
hundreds of lives
every single day,

23:58.858 --> 24:01.593
and you can't even take care
of an unnamed goldfish.

24:01.594 --> 24:03.429
Sushi.

24:04.563 --> 24:05.563
What?

24:05.564 --> 24:08.300
The fish. I named him Sushi.

24:08.301 --> 24:11.704
You said if I named him, you'd
think about moving in with me.

24:12.738 --> 24:15.407
I wasn't serious.

24:15.408 --> 24:17.442
You're breaking my heart.

24:17.443 --> 24:19.511
I'm sorry. No. No.

24:19.512 --> 24:21.479
Whoa! Sushi!

24:21.480 --> 24:24.049
Sushi needs water!
Where-Where is he?

24:24.050 --> 24:27.719
I don't know. Sushi!
Where'd he go?

24:27.720 --> 24:30.755
Oh, God. I don't even
know how that happened.

24:30.756 --> 24:32.491
How what happened?

24:36.395 --> 24:40.799
Can I have a moment
alone here, please?

24:40.800 --> 24:43.536
Take all the time
you need, brother.

24:44.570 --> 24:46.605
I appreciate that, Keith.

24:47.606 --> 24:48.874
Right.

25:16.102 --> 25:19.037
How can we just let him stay
in the bathroom like that?

25:19.038 --> 25:21.873
What if he tries
to kill himself?

25:21.874 --> 25:24.576
He's going through a
rough time right now.

25:24.577 --> 25:26.111
It's a fish!

25:26.112 --> 25:27.979
His fish.

25:27.980 --> 25:29.781
No.

25:29.782 --> 25:31.683
I'll do it. I'll check on him.

25:31.684 --> 25:36.889
Give it, like, a minute.
If I hear weird sounds...

25:43.429 --> 25:44.562
Oh!

25:44.563 --> 25:46.698
Shit!

25:46.699 --> 25:49.568
Arrrr!

27:17.723 --> 27:19.925
Uhh!

27:50.189 --> 27:52.690
Mm-hmm.

27:52.691 --> 27:55.628
Okay, buddy.

28:00.733 --> 28:04.069
I'm parched too.

28:15.681 --> 28:17.715
You too, baby.

28:17.716 --> 28:21.120
Happy.

28:28.227 --> 28:32.565
What in the... devil
stick is this?

28:41.340 --> 28:43.909
Where the hell does this go?

28:55.888 --> 28:59.857
Jimmy Buffett.

28:59.858 --> 29:03.194
Hey. You know, it's rude to just
snatch something away from somebody,

29:03.195 --> 29:05.330
especially while
they're napping.

29:05.331 --> 29:08.299
Rude?

29:08.300 --> 29:10.969
Right. This from that punk

29:10.970 --> 29:13.037
who outright stole
my electricity.

29:13.038 --> 29:16.741
You know, you'd better get your ass
out of here before I get my gun.

29:16.742 --> 29:18.810
You have a gun?

29:18.811 --> 29:20.044
Uh-huh. Three.

29:20.045 --> 29:22.881
Lola... Ooh, she's my favorite.

29:35.928 --> 29:37.895
Small problem.

29:37.896 --> 29:40.064
My car appears to be broken.

29:40.065 --> 29:42.367
Then I tried calling for
help before my phone died,

29:42.368 --> 29:45.103
which prompted me to borrow...
Steal.

29:45.104 --> 29:48.840
Steal your power just long
enough to charge my phone.

29:48.841 --> 29:50.842
You entitled punk!

29:50.843 --> 29:53.978
You know, we all got problems, kid.
Take 'em someplace else.

29:53.979 --> 29:57.416
I'm sick of looking at
that old hunk of shit.

29:59.418 --> 30:01.886
I could say the same
thing about you.

30:01.887 --> 30:03.755
Oh.

30:03.756 --> 30:06.391
Oh, that is good.

30:06.392 --> 30:08.926
That is so good. I'm
calling the cops.

30:08.927 --> 30:12.765
Okay, that's really unnecessary. I'm
sure we could work something out.

30:16.702 --> 30:19.971
Don't test me. Not testing.
Not testing.

30:19.972 --> 30:22.840
Is everything okay, June?

30:22.841 --> 30:25.177
Fuck off, Woody.

30:30.315 --> 30:32.450
Yow!

30:32.451 --> 30:34.252
Okay, look, look, look, look.

30:34.253 --> 30:36.421
I have a proposition.
You have grass.

30:36.422 --> 30:38.956
Everybody's grass needs cut.

30:38.957 --> 30:41.693
So how about in
exchange for your, uh,

30:41.694 --> 30:44.862
borrowed power, I...

30:44.863 --> 30:47.098
Stolen power,

30:47.099 --> 30:50.169
I'd be more than willing
to lend my labor.

30:56.241 --> 30:58.910
Okay.

30:58.911 --> 31:01.746
Okay, but you've got to
do some other shit too.

31:01.747 --> 31:05.850
Speaking of shit...
like clean my toilets.

31:05.851 --> 31:07.852
I don't do toilets.

31:07.853 --> 31:11.023
And I don't do you.

31:12.057 --> 31:15.159
Look, Liz? Jer. Is that you?

31:15.160 --> 31:17.895
Okay, okay, okay, okay. You win.

31:17.896 --> 31:20.865
Jerry, hold on. Say that again.

31:20.866 --> 31:22.934
You win.

31:22.935 --> 31:25.070
Jer, I'll call you back.

32:05.444 --> 32:07.512
Hey.

32:07.513 --> 32:10.549
Don't cut your
toes off, asshole.

Hmph.

33:20.085 --> 33:22.487
Tuna salad sandwich.

33:26.258 --> 33:28.861
Yummy.

33:31.263 --> 33:33.865
Is this tuna of the can?

33:33.866 --> 33:36.434
No. I caught it.

33:36.435 --> 33:37.969
Impressive.

33:37.970 --> 33:41.038
Is there... anything
else on the menu?

33:41.039 --> 33:43.074
Nada.

33:43.075 --> 33:45.576
Well, I don't really let

33:45.577 --> 33:48.446
processed bullshit into my body.
Watch your goddamn mouth.

33:48.447 --> 33:51.283
You watch your goddamn mouth.

33:56.321 --> 33:58.457
Hmm.

34:01.226 --> 34:03.294
This smells like a dead corpse.

34:03.295 --> 34:07.298
You really are an ungrateful
little bitch, aren't you?

34:07.299 --> 34:09.568
Well, you're an old-ass bitch.

34:12.304 --> 34:15.040
I'll just eat the chips.

34:19.110 --> 34:22.647
Five-letter word for "spoon."

34:22.648 --> 34:25.284
Ladle?

34:37.629 --> 34:40.364
That's it, bud. Wrap it up.

34:40.364 --> 34:42.534
That's enough for today.

34:45.304 --> 34:47.572
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

34:51.143 --> 34:53.143
Get that.

34:53.145 --> 34:54.679
That.

35:13.131 --> 35:16.233
Thanks for the laughs.
Have a nice life, huh?

35:16.234 --> 35:20.104
You too. I'm Rodney, by the way.

35:20.105 --> 35:21.572
Really?

35:21.573 --> 35:23.976
I thought your name was Asshole.

35:27.145 --> 35:30.181
I'm June.

35:30.182 --> 35:32.384
Dumpster's that way.

35:46.098 --> 35:49.034
Okay. Uh...

35:52.237 --> 35:55.239
Set the winners
aside just for you.

35:55.240 --> 35:57.641
Now, if you win, I want my cut.

35:57.642 --> 35:59.577
Fair enough.

35:59.578 --> 36:02.179
All set. Thanks, Chad.

36:02.180 --> 36:04.248
Have a good night, June.

36:04.249 --> 36:08.019
Yep. I'll see you tomorrow.

36:08.020 --> 36:10.322
Get home safe.

36:27.572 --> 36:30.709
Why are you still here?

36:32.310 --> 36:36.380
I think I, uh, left my
wallet inside your house.

36:36.381 --> 36:39.384
Thought you didn't
have any money.

36:40.352 --> 36:42.287
Oh, I don't.

36:43.488 --> 36:46.324
So why do you need
an empty wallet?

36:49.261 --> 36:51.395
I guess I don't.

36:51.396 --> 36:54.299
Guess I'll just
hit the sidewalk.

37:01.440 --> 37:04.309
You can have, um,

37:05.310 --> 37:07.579
three of these.

37:08.513 --> 37:10.749
Domestic or import?

37:12.417 --> 37:14.486
Don't push it.

37:23.128 --> 37:26.597
She'd been cheating
on me for months.

37:26.598 --> 37:29.533
Months.

37:29.534 --> 37:31.802
And if that wasn't bad enough,

37:31.803 --> 37:33.604
then Sushi died.

37:33.605 --> 37:36.407
What, your dog? No, my goldfish.

37:36.408 --> 37:39.310
May she float in peace.

37:39.311 --> 37:40.678
Hey!

37:40.679 --> 37:44.649
Sushi and I had a swimmingly
good time together.

37:48.820 --> 37:52.790
So, would you take her back?

37:52.791 --> 37:54.425
Sushi?

37:54.426 --> 37:57.895
No, the bitch.

37:57.896 --> 38:00.431
Aren't we not supposed to
call women bitches anymore?

38:00.432 --> 38:02.366
Like, feminism or
something like...

38:02.367 --> 38:06.670
No. You are not supposed
to call women bitches.

38:06.671 --> 38:10.175
But me? A cunt is a cunt.

38:18.316 --> 38:20.152
Hoo!

38:21.753 --> 38:24.321
You didn't answer my question.
You asked a question?

38:24.322 --> 38:28.159
I did. Would... Would
you take her back?

38:28.160 --> 38:30.295
Yep. Mm-hmm.

38:31.363 --> 38:33.198
No.

38:35.467 --> 38:36.934
Maybe.

38:36.935 --> 38:39.570
That's a yes.

38:39.571 --> 38:43.307
She was just really, really,

38:43.308 --> 38:46.410
really... hot.

38:46.411 --> 38:49.814
Men are so stupid.

38:51.283 --> 38:53.251
What about your husband?

38:55.754 --> 38:57.289
Dead.

38:58.390 --> 39:00.391
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

39:00.392 --> 39:01.892
Uh-huh.

39:01.893 --> 39:03.694
When did he pass?

39:03.695 --> 39:06.363
God!

39:06.364 --> 39:08.532
I hate that word.

39:08.533 --> 39:11.468
"Pass." I mean, like
death is as easy

39:11.469 --> 39:14.371
as-as-as passing gas.

39:14.372 --> 39:17.374
I mean, stupid
assholes, you know?

39:17.375 --> 39:19.977
They... They... They
use another word

39:19.978 --> 39:23.347
to make it seem like it's okay,

39:23.348 --> 39:25.884
but, you know, he's dead.

39:27.986 --> 39:30.822
D-E-A-D.

39:32.324 --> 39:34.593
Dead.

39:38.897 --> 39:40.798
So, what's your story, huh?

39:40.799 --> 39:43.767
I grew up in the
foster care system.

39:43.768 --> 39:46.737
Hmm. That must've been tough.

39:46.738 --> 39:48.273
Eh.

39:51.743 --> 39:53.411
Ah.

39:54.813 --> 39:56.348
So,

39:57.649 --> 40:00.785
you want to watch an
Antiques Roadshow?

40:01.987 --> 40:04.321
I'm gonna need another
one of those.

40:04.322 --> 40:05.689
Me too.

40:05.690 --> 40:08.360
Come on. Now, just like
I showed you. Okay.

40:21.740 --> 40:23.375
Uhh.

41:48.059 --> 41:50.761
I'll need an initial here, here,

41:50.762 --> 41:52.997
and sign and date here.

42:03.475 --> 42:05.609
Still the 28th, right?

42:05.610 --> 42:07.978
Yes.

42:07.979 --> 42:11.548
Great. Well, let me know
if anything changes.

42:11.549 --> 42:14.753
Good seeing you. You too.

42:31.035 --> 42:33.872
Um, hi?

42:35.407 --> 42:36.707
Hello there,

42:36.708 --> 42:39.676
uh, strange person.

42:39.677 --> 42:41.179
Hey there.

42:42.147 --> 42:43.547
What are you doing?

42:43.548 --> 42:46.917
Just, uh, putting some

42:46.918 --> 42:49.686
finishing touches on my place.

42:49.687 --> 42:51.588
This is your place?

42:51.589 --> 42:53.690
Well, it's, uh,

42:53.691 --> 42:55.793
more of an investment property.

42:55.794 --> 42:58.729
It's a foreclosure.
Probably gonna flip it.

42:58.730 --> 43:00.799
I'm Rodney, by the way.

43:07.939 --> 43:10.141
Hey, where are you going?

43:13.611 --> 43:15.780
Who's this?

43:18.817 --> 43:20.651
That's the help.

43:20.652 --> 43:22.653
Really?

43:22.654 --> 43:25.590
I'm gonna take this personally
here in a second. A word?

43:47.645 --> 43:49.613
Unh.

43:49.614 --> 43:51.748
So nice to see you, sweetheart.

43:51.749 --> 43:54.719
I love these sweatpants. What
is this, the 20th day in a row?

43:57.956 --> 44:00.657
Mom, these are all full.

44:00.658 --> 44:03.561
Have you even taken
a single pill?

44:04.996 --> 44:07.097
Mom, this is your life.

44:07.098 --> 44:10.767
If you read, you will
see that it says,

44:10.768 --> 44:13.704
"Do not mix the pills
with the booze."

44:13.705 --> 44:15.706
So I'm just following
directions.

44:15.707 --> 44:18.075
Oh, then lay off the booze, Mom.
It's simple.

44:18.076 --> 44:20.010
Honey,

44:20.011 --> 44:22.646
if I cold-turkey quit,
that will kill me.

44:22.647 --> 44:26.683
Just let me have
whatever I need, okay,

44:26.684 --> 44:29.553
to enjoy the rest of my life.

44:29.554 --> 44:31.054
God. That's crazy.

44:31.055 --> 44:32.923
Here I was actually
thinking you were listening

44:32.924 --> 44:34.758
to what I was saying at
lunch the other day.

44:34.759 --> 44:36.760
I was listening.

44:36.761 --> 44:38.262
You said, "Get somebody"

44:38.263 --> 44:40.697
to help out around the
house," so I did, look.

44:40.698 --> 44:43.767
Helping himself to lunch!

44:43.768 --> 44:45.669
Is he actually homeless?

44:45.670 --> 44:49.706
Hey! Zip it. You are
homeless, remember?

44:49.707 --> 44:53.110
Is there any garlic sauce?
That is for her, not you.

44:53.111 --> 44:56.114
This is actually pretty good.
Out.

45:01.953 --> 45:04.656
This is your life.

45:21.239 --> 45:24.107
Hello again. Please
don't yell at me.

45:24.108 --> 45:27.177
I think we got off on
the wrong foot here.

45:27.178 --> 45:30.180
Look, I'm not here to
steal your mom's shit

45:30.181 --> 45:33.617
or take advantage of her or
anything like that, okay?

45:33.618 --> 45:36.887
I promise. Can you
do me a small favor?

45:36.888 --> 45:38.789
Sure.

45:38.790 --> 45:41.091
Do you think you can try

45:41.092 --> 45:43.694
and get my mom to take her meds?

45:43.695 --> 45:45.862
Yeah, no problem.

45:45.863 --> 45:48.165
Seems easy, but it's not.

45:48.166 --> 45:50.734
Are you saying that
June is stubborn? Gasp.

45:50.735 --> 45:52.869
Trick her like a dog.

45:52.870 --> 45:54.304
Seriously?

45:54.305 --> 45:56.807
- Doctor's orders.
- Hey, Olivia.

45:56.808 --> 45:58.977
Hey, Floyd.

46:06.084 --> 46:08.620
See you in Pilates. Oh, yeah.

46:29.173 --> 46:32.143
How many dead cats are in here?

46:54.699 --> 46:58.969
You think darkness is your ally,

46:58.970 --> 47:01.772
but you merely adopted it.

47:01.773 --> 47:04.741
I was born into it.

47:04.742 --> 47:06.376
Molded by it.

47:06.377 --> 47:10.914
I didn't see the light
until I was already a man.

47:10.915 --> 47:14.451
But by then it was nothing
to me but blinding!

47:14.452 --> 47:16.920
How long have you
been standing there?

47:16.921 --> 47:19.157
You're a weird little man.

47:24.128 --> 47:27.130
There's a ton of
cool shit in here.

47:27.131 --> 47:30.967
Really? Who the hell do
you think put it here?

47:30.968 --> 47:32.837
Check this out.

47:41.112 --> 47:43.380
This is how Jim and I met.
Really?

47:43.381 --> 47:47.385
I see this handsome guy ride by.

47:49.821 --> 47:52.022
I whistled.

47:52.023 --> 47:55.025
He stopped.

47:55.026 --> 47:56.861
I got on.

47:58.062 --> 48:00.498
And never got off.

48:17.048 --> 48:19.149
♪ Supper's almost ready ♪

48:19.150 --> 48:21.151

48:36.334 --> 48:38.969
Hmm. What's on the menu?

48:38.970 --> 48:42.239
Doesn't smell half bad.

48:42.240 --> 48:43.975
Mmm!

48:46.811 --> 48:50.981
Well, the old bitch can be
nice when she wants to be.

48:50.982 --> 48:54.918
I like to call it...
Rodney Surprise.

48:54.919 --> 48:57.087
Ah. It's pasta with...

48:57.088 --> 49:00.825
Uh, uh, uh! Don't
spoil the surprise.

49:04.362 --> 49:08.365
So, why don't you invite
a friend for dinner?

49:08.366 --> 49:12.170
I mean, that is if
you've got any.

49:13.538 --> 49:15.405
Yeah, sure.

49:15.406 --> 49:18.108
I think I know someone
who can make it.

49:18.109 --> 49:20.878
♪ Supper's almost ready ♪

49:26.117 --> 49:29.085
Oh, June, drink up!

49:29.086 --> 49:32.222
You are in the liquor penalty box
right now. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

49:32.223 --> 49:36.393
Ew! That did not look good.

49:36.394 --> 49:39.563
Okay. Boy, we are running
low on the old hooch.

49:39.564 --> 49:42.132
Oh, can't you pussies keep up?

49:42.133 --> 49:44.601
What does that mean?

49:44.602 --> 49:46.970
That means we're her friends.

49:46.971 --> 49:49.573
Uh-huh.

49:49.574 --> 49:53.143
Okay, I think I saw a bottle
of something in the garage.

49:53.144 --> 49:54.244
All right. Be right back.

49:54.245 --> 49:56.947
You'd better.

49:56.948 --> 49:59.316
So,

49:59.317 --> 50:02.419
shark attack, shark attack,

50:02.420 --> 50:04.956
shark attack, shark attack!

50:18.369 --> 50:20.904
Shark attack! Booze attack.

50:20.905 --> 50:23.039
Booze attack. Booze attack. Oh, yummy,
yummy, yummy. Look at what he brought.

50:23.040 --> 50:25.942
Look at what he brought. Here.
Arm-wrestle me. Arm-wrestle me.

50:25.943 --> 50:27.143
Come on. Ready? Here we go.

50:27.144 --> 50:28.980
Oh, no!

50:30.615 --> 50:34.317
Got ya. He's a strong man.

50:34.318 --> 50:36.653
Okay. All right, guys.

50:36.654 --> 50:39.189
Who's up? Your turn.
It's all yours, big guy.

50:39.190 --> 50:40.924
Your turn, buddy.

50:40.925 --> 50:44.461
All right, but I can't
drink much more juice.

50:44.462 --> 50:47.163
It gives me the runs. Oh, God.

50:47.164 --> 50:49.432
Well, shit. I think, then,

50:49.433 --> 50:52.303
it's time for you to
have your first beer.

50:57.375 --> 50:59.576
All right, I came
as fast as I could.

50:59.577 --> 51:01.678
Oh! With burritos!

51:01.679 --> 51:05.282
Okay! 'Cause I made dinner,

51:05.283 --> 51:08.285
so, not sure why we have that.

51:08.286 --> 51:11.254
Yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy. Yum!

51:11.255 --> 51:13.156
What's that?

51:13.157 --> 51:15.158
Uh, special occasion.

51:15.159 --> 51:17.627
Company. Company.

51:17.628 --> 51:20.096
About that dinner?

51:20.097 --> 51:22.098
Let me get some plates.

51:22.099 --> 51:25.168
Yeah, and we're all going to eat.
You too, Charlie, okay?

51:25.169 --> 51:26.703
You like burritos? Yep.

51:26.704 --> 51:28.438
Mmm. Me too.

51:28.439 --> 51:30.573
How's that look to you, huh?
Here we go.

51:30.574 --> 51:33.243
So you met my mom when you
were stealing her power?

51:33.244 --> 51:35.679
Borrowing. Stealing.

51:35.680 --> 51:37.581
Stealing. Yeah.

51:40.217 --> 51:41.618
Who does that?

51:41.619 --> 51:44.220
You would've done the
exact same thing.

51:44.221 --> 51:46.222
No. No.

51:46.223 --> 51:48.592
No, you wouldn't have.

51:51.662 --> 51:54.064
So you actually
like living here.

51:54.065 --> 51:56.399
Yeah, I do.

51:56.400 --> 51:58.468
I mean, there's this...

51:58.469 --> 52:01.972
There's, like, one thing that's...
mm.

52:01.973 --> 52:03.239
What?

52:03.240 --> 52:06.343
Sometimes June makes
me rub her feet.

52:06.344 --> 52:08.979
Ew! What? No, I'm kidding.

52:08.980 --> 52:11.248
That only happened, like, twice.

52:12.416 --> 52:15.285
You are a freak.

52:15.286 --> 52:17.420
So you got a man?

52:17.421 --> 52:20.090
Whoa. Don't even.

52:20.091 --> 52:22.258
What?

52:22.259 --> 52:25.061
Well, the... the first
question you asked me...

52:25.062 --> 52:28.098
The very first question...

52:28.099 --> 52:30.233
Isn't about my work,

52:30.234 --> 52:34.037
which I do way too much of,

52:34.038 --> 52:37.173
or-or about my hobbies

52:37.174 --> 52:39.109
or my interests or...

52:39.110 --> 52:40.744
No.

52:40.745 --> 52:44.714
No, the very first question you
ask me is if I've got a man?

52:44.715 --> 52:47.585
So you're single. Go to hell.

52:49.487 --> 52:53.289
I'm going through a, uh,
pretty rough breakup myself.

52:53.290 --> 52:55.325
She dumped me,

52:55.326 --> 52:59.697
but I guess you could say
I returned the favor.

53:02.666 --> 53:06.302
I'm s... What? What
are you laughing at?

53:06.303 --> 53:07.537
You don't want to know.

53:07.538 --> 53:09.472
Okay, now you have to tell me.

53:09.473 --> 53:12.442
You can't judge me.
I make no promises.

53:12.443 --> 53:14.377
I upper-decked her.

53:14.378 --> 53:16.212
You what?

53:16.213 --> 53:20.250
You know the top
part of the toilet

53:20.251 --> 53:23.053
where there's the lid, and then you
got the clean water up there, right?

53:23.054 --> 53:24.421
Mm-hmm. So...

53:24.422 --> 53:26.756
Yeah, I don't like
where this is going.

53:26.757 --> 53:29.526
Yeah, so I went
number two in there,

53:29.527 --> 53:34.131
and then I sealed that bad boy
up like an Egyptian coffin.

53:37.802 --> 53:40.071
How old are you?

53:45.643 --> 53:47.343
No.

53:47.344 --> 53:49.180
I misread that. Mm-hmm.

54:09.233 --> 54:12.402
Look at this.

54:12.403 --> 54:13.637
Go.

54:17.408 --> 54:19.677
Whoa-ho-ho-ho!

54:22.313 --> 54:24.648
Brought you a
little movie snack.

54:31.288 --> 54:33.557
You son of a bitch.

54:39.363 --> 54:41.531
Ollie put you up to this?

54:41.532 --> 54:44.602
I plead the Fifth. Mm.

54:50.574 --> 54:53.277
I'll eat the banana,
but that's it.

54:56.413 --> 54:58.215
You're a good kid.

55:06.290 --> 55:07.892
Hello.

55:09.627 --> 55:12.495
All right, I would
like a pack of reds,

55:12.496 --> 55:15.198
a fifth of gin,

55:15.199 --> 55:18.769
and six scratchers, but please
pull every other scratch off.

55:28.445 --> 55:30.280
Hello.

55:30.281 --> 55:32.782
Yeah. June said there was

55:32.783 --> 55:36.519
some asshole coming by to
get some stuff for her.

55:36.520 --> 55:39.289
Okay. I will take
a pack of reds,

55:39.290 --> 55:41.457
a fifth of gin, and
six scratch-offs,

55:41.458 --> 55:43.793
but please pull every
other scratcher.

55:43.794 --> 55:46.496
Hey, how is she, by the way?

55:46.497 --> 55:48.699
She's fine.

55:50.201 --> 55:52.268
Yeah, she hasn't been
coming in here lately,

55:52.269 --> 55:55.538
and she didn't look too
good the last time...

55:55.539 --> 55:58.441
You know what? Never mind.
I'm rambling.

55:58.442 --> 56:01.979
Uh, just costs $10, for June.

56:10.421 --> 56:12.488
Tell her I said hi. Will do.

56:12.489 --> 56:14.258
Good.

56:22.533 --> 56:26.603
♪ Her father was
a concrete man ♪

56:26.604 --> 56:29.006
♪ And her mother was a painter ♪

56:31.508 --> 56:35.612
♪ Born with good hands ♪

56:35.613 --> 56:38.782
♪ She was born a creator ♪

57:00.871 --> 57:03.306
Aren't you, uh, hungry?

57:03.307 --> 57:05.609
No, I guess not.

57:08.646 --> 57:11.448
Huh. Well, that's a first.

57:12.916 --> 57:16.287
Well, there's more for me.

57:17.655 --> 57:20.324
What are those pills for?

57:29.433 --> 57:32.468
My business, Rodney.
I'm serious.

57:32.469 --> 57:34.304
So am I.

57:34.305 --> 57:36.540
Mind your business.

57:39.376 --> 57:40.943
It's just, uh,

57:40.944 --> 57:43.780
Olivia seemed pretty intent
on getting you to take them.

57:43.781 --> 57:45.648
Now there goes my appetite.

57:45.649 --> 57:48.618
And earlier today at the
convenience store...

57:48.619 --> 57:52.622
What'd he tell you? He just
asked if you were okay.

57:52.623 --> 57:54.692
What are you hiding?

58:00.531 --> 58:03.000
You know what?

58:04.601 --> 58:06.602
I'm going for a drive.

58:06.603 --> 58:08.971
You're not allowed to drive.

58:08.972 --> 58:11.641
Then you go for a goddamn drive.
I don't have a car.

58:11.642 --> 58:14.712
Take mine. How sick are you?

58:17.514 --> 58:18.781
I'm fine.

58:18.782 --> 58:20.750
Don't lie to me.

58:20.751 --> 58:23.586
"Don't lie to me"?

58:23.587 --> 58:25.621
What are you, my father?

58:25.622 --> 58:27.591
Huh? What do you care?

58:29.026 --> 58:32.128
Because I care about
you, you idiot.

58:32.129 --> 58:34.530
Don't talk to me like
that, you son of a bitch.

58:34.531 --> 58:36.899
Who the hell do you
think you are?

58:36.900 --> 58:39.936
Look, um,

58:39.937 --> 58:41.971
I'm just worried, that's all.

58:41.972 --> 58:44.374
Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah.

58:44.375 --> 58:46.876
Right, you're worried. Yeah, I
know what you're worried about.

58:46.877 --> 58:49.546
You're worried about
losing your free ride.

58:51.648 --> 58:54.852
You know what? You know what?

58:55.919 --> 58:58.588
This is not working for me.

58:58.589 --> 59:00.656
Uh-uh. I, uh...

59:00.657 --> 59:03.726
I think you have
overstayed your welcome.

59:03.727 --> 59:06.629
Pack up your stuff. Tonight.

59:06.630 --> 59:08.765
I want you to pack up
your stuff and go.

59:08.766 --> 59:11.467
You don't mean that, June.

59:11.468 --> 59:13.069
Oh, don't I?

59:13.070 --> 59:15.705
Don't I?

59:15.706 --> 59:18.007
You know, I, uh,

59:18.008 --> 59:20.576
I gave you a roof, I gave
you a place to stay,

59:20.577 --> 59:22.912
I put food in your stomach, but
that is not enough for you.

59:22.913 --> 59:25.581
No, no. You just
have to keep prying,

59:25.582 --> 59:28.117
don't you, kid? Huh?

59:28.118 --> 59:29.919
Look, if I want to...

59:29.920 --> 59:32.555
if I want to kill myself,

59:32.556 --> 59:34.724
that is my business.

59:34.725 --> 59:37.160
June, you're blowing this
way out of proportion!

59:37.161 --> 59:39.595
And you get out of here.
Go on. Go on. Get out.

59:39.596 --> 59:43.167
Leave. Get out. Yeah? No
wonder you're all alone.

59:44.701 --> 59:47.203
Fuck you. Fuck you.

59:47.204 --> 59:49.605
Fuck you. Fuck you.
Stop, stop, please.

59:49.606 --> 59:52.141
You're gonna talk shit, huh?
Hey! Hey! Stop!

59:52.142 --> 59:54.477
You're gonna talk such shit stuff?
Man up. I'm sorry!

59:54.478 --> 59:57.580
Man up, huh? Pussy! Pussy!
I am not gonna fight you!

59:57.581 --> 01:00:02.486
June! June! Get the fuck
out of my house! Get out!

01:00:08.091 --> 01:00:10.694
And you're gonna die in
this house all Al...

01:01:26.003 --> 01:01:28.004
Well, thanks for coming, Rudy.

01:01:28.005 --> 01:01:30.306
We need someone who could
start right this second.

01:01:30.307 --> 01:01:33.009
We are clogged with work.

01:01:33.010 --> 01:01:35.711
It's actually Rodney.

01:01:35.712 --> 01:01:37.947
Huh?

01:01:37.948 --> 01:01:39.982
Ah, that's right. I apologize.

01:01:39.983 --> 01:01:42.252
Well, we've been having
a shitter of a day.

01:01:44.855 --> 01:01:46.856
So, do you have any
plumbing experience?

01:01:46.857 --> 01:01:49.592
We need someone who can lay
a lot of pipe, and quick!

01:01:49.593 --> 01:01:52.862
Hey! Hey!

01:01:52.863 --> 01:01:56.766
This work is no laughing matter.

01:01:56.767 --> 01:01:59.869
You'd be amazed at some of
the house calls we get.

01:01:59.870 --> 01:02:02.939
The things some
kids do to toilets!

01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:06.343
You ever heard of an upper-deck?

01:02:09.846 --> 01:02:12.281
Excuse me.

01:02:12.282 --> 01:02:14.884
Talk to me.

01:02:14.885 --> 01:02:18.721
Well, just do it! You'll
be saving someone's day,

01:02:18.722 --> 01:02:21.657
and frankly, we
can use the cash.

01:02:21.658 --> 01:02:25.861
You'll be a hero. Little Tommy
will forever salute you.

01:02:25.862 --> 01:02:29.298
So, back to you.

01:02:29.299 --> 01:02:31.667
You said you guys need the cash?

01:02:31.668 --> 01:02:34.670
Yeah, but don't worry. I'll
make sure you get paid.

01:02:34.671 --> 01:02:36.372
Really?

01:02:36.373 --> 01:02:37.907
Of course.

01:02:37.908 --> 01:02:40.876
When a poor person's
toilet gets clogged,

01:02:40.877 --> 01:02:43.879
they grab a plunger and
fix it themselves.

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:46.716
When a rich person's
toilet gets clogged,

01:02:46.717 --> 01:02:48.985
they grab a Valium, Xanax,

01:02:48.986 --> 01:02:51.387
Klonopin, Ativan, whatever,

01:02:51.388 --> 01:02:52.989
and they call us.

01:02:52.990 --> 01:02:55.291
They're willing to pay
us hundreds of dollars

01:02:55.292 --> 01:02:58.729
to fish their shit
out of the toilet.

01:03:02.666 --> 01:03:04.947
I'm sorry. I thought you were
making a joke about the shit.

01:03:04.971 --> 01:03:06.302
Kid, don't curse.

01:03:06.303 --> 01:03:09.939
If you can't take this
job interview seriously,

01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:12.408
you probably don't belong here.

01:03:12.409 --> 01:03:15.678
Well, I appreciate
the consideration.

01:03:15.679 --> 01:03:18.948
Yeah. You didn't get
the job, idiot.

01:03:18.949 --> 01:03:21.651
That's not my résumé.

01:03:21.652 --> 01:03:25.722
It's not? Oh, this
guy's good though.

01:03:27.758 --> 01:03:30.926
Rudy, we are clogged with work.

01:03:30.927 --> 01:03:33.864
Okay.

01:03:40.270 --> 01:03:43.740
So he just up and
left, just like that?

01:03:46.877 --> 01:03:49.078
Just like that.

01:03:49.079 --> 01:03:52.114
It was like... Flash Man.

01:03:52.115 --> 01:03:56.752
Right, and you're sure you
had nothing to do with it.

01:03:56.753 --> 01:03:59.389
Absolutely. Nothing.

01:04:01.858 --> 01:04:03.226
Mom.

01:04:07.397 --> 01:04:09.331
He was an asshole.

01:04:09.332 --> 01:04:11.734
So are you.

01:04:11.735 --> 01:04:13.270
Good point.

01:04:14.838 --> 01:04:16.806
Are you going to apologize?

01:04:16.807 --> 01:04:18.841
What for?

01:04:18.842 --> 01:04:21.077
And besides, I don't
even know where he is.

01:04:21.078 --> 01:04:23.979
You call him. I don't
have his number.

01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:26.482
What? Seriously?

01:04:26.483 --> 01:04:28.084
He lived here.

01:04:28.085 --> 01:04:31.088
Why would I have a
need to call him?

01:04:47.437 --> 01:04:50.006
He really didn't have any money.

01:04:58.081 --> 01:05:00.015
I got this.

01:05:00.016 --> 01:05:01.984
Check and mate, mate.

01:05:01.985 --> 01:05:06.021
I call a re-do. I'm gonna
quit while I'm still on top.

01:05:06.022 --> 01:05:08.057
Come on!

01:05:08.058 --> 01:05:09.458
Fine.

01:05:09.459 --> 01:05:10.994
Yes!

01:05:14.030 --> 01:05:15.999
You all right?

01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:19.068
What? I'm fine.

01:05:19.069 --> 01:05:21.304
You should go talk to her.

01:05:22.973 --> 01:05:24.406
You keep saying that.

01:05:24.407 --> 01:05:28.010
Because, duh, it's true.
How about this?

01:05:28.011 --> 01:05:30.447
If I win, then you have to.

01:05:32.149 --> 01:05:34.850
You've been playing me
this whole time. Yes.

01:05:34.851 --> 01:05:39.021
No, I mean, you've been waiting for this
moment, and now you're gonna whoop my ass.

01:05:39.022 --> 01:05:40.289
Also yes.

01:05:40.290 --> 01:05:42.158
Well, what if I quit?

01:05:42.159 --> 01:05:45.294
Then you'll have lost
because you resigned.

01:05:45.295 --> 01:05:47.429
You're going to be
president someday.

01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:49.865
Nah, that's for chumps.

01:05:49.866 --> 01:05:52.535
Party on the top floor.

01:05:52.536 --> 01:05:54.470
Slap it, boss.

01:05:54.471 --> 01:05:57.006
Little slap to make her happy.

01:05:57.007 --> 01:05:58.874
What?

01:05:58.875 --> 01:06:01.144
Weirdo.

01:06:07.918 --> 01:06:09.485
Hey. Um,

01:06:09.486 --> 01:06:12.221
so I know this is
kind of awkward,

01:06:12.222 --> 01:06:14.223
and you probably didn't
expect to see me again

01:06:14.224 --> 01:06:19.094
after the whole
incident, but, um,

01:06:19.095 --> 01:06:21.297
is there any chance
I could crash,

01:06:21.298 --> 01:06:22.832
just for tonight?

01:06:22.833 --> 01:06:25.968
You are more than
welcome here, buddy.

01:06:25.969 --> 01:06:29.039
It's great to see you. You too.

01:06:32.242 --> 01:06:34.176
You too, my man. Like I said,

01:06:34.177 --> 01:06:37.479
it'll just be one or two...
One or two or a few.

01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:39.381
Yeah. Let's make it...

01:06:39.382 --> 01:06:41.917
Wanna call it three or 14?

01:06:41.918 --> 01:06:43.519
Just a handshake on five?

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:46.055
Can you just promise
me, like, a week?

01:06:46.056 --> 01:06:47.189
Five...

01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:49.526
Do you have pizza? Well...

01:06:52.028 --> 01:06:54.364
Fuck it.

01:07:00.136 --> 01:07:02.504
Did you take your pills? Yes.

01:07:02.505 --> 01:07:04.274
I promise.

01:07:06.643 --> 01:07:08.544
How are you feeling?

01:07:08.545 --> 01:07:10.447
Like shit.

01:07:12.015 --> 01:07:14.484
I could use a drink.

01:07:19.956 --> 01:07:24.194
I'm sorry I haven't been
around as much as I should be.

01:07:25.962 --> 01:07:28.631
You work your ass off.

01:07:28.632 --> 01:07:30.633
And you love it.

01:07:30.634 --> 01:07:34.271
And I love that you love it.

01:07:37.207 --> 01:07:39.910
Never say you're sorry.

01:07:42.178 --> 01:07:45.214
You take good care of me, hon.

01:07:45.215 --> 01:07:48.050
Better than anybody
could ever do.

01:07:48.051 --> 01:07:51.053
It's not your fault you got a...

01:07:51.054 --> 01:07:53.657
stubborn old bitch of a mom.

01:08:06.970 --> 01:08:09.572
I am so proud of you.

01:08:12.409 --> 01:08:16.045
And your dad... oh...

01:08:16.046 --> 01:08:19.182
He would have been
real proud of you too.

01:08:23.053 --> 01:08:26.087
You did good, baby.

01:08:26.089 --> 01:08:28.358
You did good.

01:08:45.175 --> 01:08:48.010
Mom? Are you okay?

01:08:48.011 --> 01:08:50.412
And your actions

01:08:50.412 --> 01:08:53.048
put me in a slightly
more hurtful position.

01:08:53.049 --> 01:08:56.553
You're basically the reason
I'm in this entire situation.

01:08:59.322 --> 01:09:02.624
Do you know what
your problem is?

01:09:02.625 --> 01:09:04.059
I'm just lost.

01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:07.296
You escalate things.

01:09:07.296 --> 01:09:11.133
You need to un-escalate things.

01:09:11.134 --> 01:09:13.268
You need to de-escalate.

01:09:13.269 --> 01:09:16.205
You're going up. You
need to go down

01:09:16.206 --> 01:09:18.374
and un-escalate it

01:09:18.375 --> 01:09:21.042
instead of escalate.

01:09:21.044 --> 01:09:23.246
That's your problem.

01:09:25.548 --> 01:09:26.783
Okay.

01:09:30.787 --> 01:09:32.322
Excuse me.

01:09:33.356 --> 01:09:35.158
But I see what you're saying.

01:10:15.732 --> 01:10:18.301
Hello, people I don't know.

01:10:21.371 --> 01:10:23.139
Tough crowd.

01:10:25.375 --> 01:10:27.576
Is this some sort of a...

01:10:27.577 --> 01:10:29.679
party, or what are...

01:10:32.082 --> 01:10:34.882
Either way, I'm gonna guess my invitation
was probably lost in the mail.

01:10:34.906 --> 01:10:38.576
And I don't really have a mailbox right
now, you know what I'm sayin'? Hey!

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:46.429
What, did somebody
die or something?

01:10:50.867 --> 01:10:54.403
Um, I just personally
wanted to thank all of you

01:10:54.404 --> 01:10:56.405
for being here today.

01:10:56.406 --> 01:11:00.242
I know you all hold a special
place in my mom's heart.

01:11:00.243 --> 01:11:03.880
I'd like to say a few words myself.
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

01:11:06.382 --> 01:11:07.884
Mm.

01:11:13.156 --> 01:11:15.324
Allow me.

01:11:15.325 --> 01:11:16.860
Okay.

01:11:19.329 --> 01:11:22.231
You've come to
fight as free men,

01:11:22.232 --> 01:11:25.400
and free men you are.

01:11:25.401 --> 01:11:28.538
But what will you do
with that freedom?

01:11:29.873 --> 01:11:32.407
Will you run?

01:11:32.408 --> 01:11:36.478
Or will you fight? Is
that from Braveheart?

01:11:36.479 --> 01:11:38.348
June fought.

01:11:39.516 --> 01:11:41.316
June was a fighter.

01:11:41.317 --> 01:11:44.253
I didn't know her... that well,

01:11:44.254 --> 01:11:46.321
but I knew that much.

01:11:46.322 --> 01:11:49.358
She took a chance on me
when no one else wouldn't.

01:11:49.359 --> 01:11:50.627
"Would." Thank you.

01:11:51.895 --> 01:11:53.795
I guess now's the
part in the speech

01:11:53.796 --> 01:11:56.899
where people say all those
stupid cliché things like,

01:11:56.900 --> 01:11:58.834
"She lived life her way"

01:11:58.835 --> 01:12:01.403
or "danced to the beat
of her own drum,"

01:12:01.404 --> 01:12:04.339
but I think June
would hate that.

01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:06.276
She would.

01:12:08.211 --> 01:12:12.648
I had the, uh, worst
day of my life.

01:12:12.649 --> 01:12:16.185
Everything that could
go wrong did go wrong,

01:12:16.186 --> 01:12:17.886
and then I met June,

01:12:17.887 --> 01:12:21.490
and she rubbed it in my face.

01:12:21.491 --> 01:12:24.660
But then she gave
me a place to stay,

01:12:24.661 --> 01:12:28.297
and she gave me tuna sandwiches,

01:12:28.298 --> 01:12:30.732
and they were fuckin' terrible.

01:12:30.733 --> 01:12:32.802
But she made me, me again.

01:12:35.371 --> 01:12:38.273
I, uh, guess that's
all I have to say.

01:12:38.274 --> 01:12:40.910
Shit, fuckin' allergies or...

01:12:43.613 --> 01:12:46.382
Who wants to get laid?

01:12:49.619 --> 01:12:54.389
Wake up! Yo! Hey, wake up!

01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:56.858
I decided to have a funeral

01:12:56.859 --> 01:12:58.928
for my old self.

01:13:00.563 --> 01:13:03.565
It passed.

01:13:03.566 --> 01:13:07.236
And me? I am headed to Hawaii.

01:13:07.237 --> 01:13:09.371
How old are you?

01:13:09.372 --> 01:13:12.474
Oh, I got you good!

01:13:12.475 --> 01:13:15.377
You monster.

01:13:15.378 --> 01:13:18.380
Come on, let's get you up.
Come on. Get up!

01:13:18.381 --> 01:13:22.417
Let's help her.
After we get me up.

01:13:22.418 --> 01:13:25.387
Ooh! Yeah. Yep.

01:13:25.388 --> 01:13:27.689
I'm up, I'm up, I'm up.

01:13:27.690 --> 01:13:29.730
All right, well, hey, I just
wanted to let you know,

01:13:29.754 --> 01:13:32.961
all that stuff that I said
over there, I was just joking.

01:13:32.962 --> 01:13:35.430
I didn't mean any of that,
so don't get weird.

01:13:35.431 --> 01:13:39.835
Well, some people grow up, and
others, like you, yeah...

01:13:39.836 --> 01:13:43.373
born a little bitch,
always a little bitch.

01:13:45.375 --> 01:13:47.577
So, Hawaii? Mm-hmm.

01:13:50.513 --> 01:13:52.914
The ocean air will
be good for her.

01:13:52.915 --> 01:13:54.983
Uh,

01:13:54.984 --> 01:13:58.353
speaking of it, uh,
want to give me

01:13:58.354 --> 01:14:01.390
a minute, a little
tick with Rodney?

01:14:01.391 --> 01:14:03.425
Yeah.

01:14:03.426 --> 01:14:05.494
Oh, hey, Rodney? Yeah?

01:14:05.495 --> 01:14:09.299
Thank you for taking care
of her when I couldn't.

01:14:15.571 --> 01:14:17.873
So, listen.

01:14:17.874 --> 01:14:21.543
Against my better judgment

01:14:21.544 --> 01:14:24.379
and the advice of my lawyer,

01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:27.516
I decided I wanted to leave
you a little something.

01:14:27.517 --> 01:14:30.553
You shouldn't have. What is it?

01:14:31.821 --> 01:14:34.090
Now I really know
I shouldn't have.

01:14:36.526 --> 01:14:39.828
Corner convenience store?
I actually own it.

01:14:39.829 --> 01:14:41.630
Hmm?

01:14:41.631 --> 01:14:45.401
And I'm leaving it to you.

01:14:46.636 --> 01:14:47.636
What? Mm-hmm.

01:14:47.637 --> 01:14:50.672
Why would you do that?

01:14:50.673 --> 01:14:53.542
'Cause I don't scare you.

01:14:53.543 --> 01:14:56.079
And, uh, you make me laugh.

01:14:58.414 --> 01:15:01.583
I appreciate the faith.

01:15:01.584 --> 01:15:03.485
I almost forgot.

01:15:03.486 --> 01:15:06.922
Meet me in the garage.

01:15:06.923 --> 01:15:08.757
The garage?

01:15:08.758 --> 01:15:11.560
Easy. This is very
scary, Rodney.

01:15:11.561 --> 01:15:13.562
Easy.

01:15:13.563 --> 01:15:15.130
Stop. Here?

01:15:15.131 --> 01:15:17.065
Keep 'em closed. Okay.
All right.

01:15:17.066 --> 01:15:18.967
Don't cheat. I'm
not gonna cheat.

01:15:18.968 --> 01:15:21.603
Could ruin the whole thing if you cheat.
I'm not a cheater.

01:15:21.604 --> 01:15:23.071
All right.

01:15:23.072 --> 01:15:25.540
I'm many things, but
I'm not a cheater.

01:15:25.541 --> 01:15:27.976
And... t...

01:15:27.977 --> 01:15:30.479
Hang on. Can I open 'em?

01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:31.580
No.

01:15:31.581 --> 01:15:33.448
♪ Ta-da! ♪

01:15:33.449 --> 01:15:35.084
Can I open? Yes.

01:15:36.853 --> 01:15:39.389
New set of wheels to get around.

01:15:52.602 --> 01:15:54.669
Rodney, I don't know...

01:15:54.670 --> 01:15:56.639
I don't know what to say.

01:16:03.713 --> 01:16:06.982
Ah, ya... jerk!

01:16:06.983 --> 01:16:09.418
I love you too.

01:16:09.419 --> 01:16:10.820
Yeah.

01:16:11.854 --> 01:16:13.556
Ah!

01:16:15.725 --> 01:16:17.426
You might need this.

01:16:17.427 --> 01:16:20.429
Oh, yeah. Probably not, but...

01:16:20.430 --> 01:16:22.598
It's not empty.

01:16:24.033 --> 01:16:26.067
"Noice!"

01:16:26.068 --> 01:16:27.702
Back pay.

01:16:27.703 --> 01:16:28.871
Ah.

01:16:30.540 --> 01:16:32.574
Come here.

01:16:32.575 --> 01:16:35.477
Come here. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:16:35.478 --> 01:16:38.648
You like it. Love it.
Come on. No. No.

01:16:41.584 --> 01:16:42.617
Yeah?

01:16:42.618 --> 01:16:44.053
Come on.

01:16:48.624 --> 01:16:49.858
Are you crying? No!

01:16:49.859 --> 01:16:51.993
Oh, I... couldn't see.

01:16:51.994 --> 01:16:55.565
I'm, you know, remembering.

01:16:56.966 --> 01:16:59.935
You know, they say
you never forget.

01:16:59.936 --> 01:17:02.737
Let's hope to hell
they're right.

01:17:02.738 --> 01:17:04.240
Pray for me.

01:17:14.584 --> 01:17:16.585
June.

01:17:16.586 --> 01:17:18.253
Woody.

01:17:18.254 --> 01:17:21.089
Let me just cut to the chase. I
heard that you were leaving,

01:17:21.090 --> 01:17:23.825
and I want to wish you farewell.

01:17:23.826 --> 01:17:27.929
It was truly a
pleasure knowing you.

01:17:27.930 --> 01:17:29.898
You don't mean any of that.

01:17:29.899 --> 01:17:31.766
No, I do not.

01:17:31.767 --> 01:17:33.869
You know, Woody,

01:17:33.870 --> 01:17:37.006
you... weren't the
worst neighbor.

01:17:38.207 --> 01:17:40.609
I think in a way,
I'm gonna miss you.

01:17:40.610 --> 01:17:43.178
Wow.

01:17:43.179 --> 01:17:45.747

01:17:45.748 --> 01:17:47.883
