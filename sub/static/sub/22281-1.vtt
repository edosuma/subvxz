There's the Kavik airstrip.

00:19.367 --> 00:21.200
All right, there's home.

00:21.633 --> 00:24.200
SUE: Roughly four months
since the date of the injury.

00:27.700 --> 00:30.367
Boneheaded myself
on the snow machine.

00:30.900 --> 00:32.667
Broke the collarbone, bad.

00:33.500 --> 00:34.967
I've had some surgeries,

00:35.033 --> 00:36.467
I'm still carrying
a bunch of stitches,

00:36.533 --> 00:39.700
but the doctor said,
"If you behave yourself,

00:39.767 --> 00:41.300
"I will trust you to go home."

00:41.733 --> 00:44.333
SUE: It all looks uh, slightly
different than when I left.

00:44.833 --> 00:46.333
It looks like it might be,

00:46.400 --> 00:48.767
might not be quite
as nice out at Kavik.

00:49.300 --> 00:51.133
PILOT: Why don't
we just go down here?

00:51.533 --> 00:52.633
SUE: Yeah.

00:53.033 --> 00:55.333
This has been
almost four months

00:55.400 --> 00:58.067
since anybody
has set foot in Kavik.

00:58.633 --> 01:01.133
I don't know
what I'm walking into.

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

01:27.200 --> 01:29.233
NARRATOR: Sue Aikens has spent
the past four months

01:29.300 --> 01:31.533
in Fairbanks recovering
from surgery.

01:32.067 --> 01:35.000
As Kavik River Camp's
sole proprietor,

01:35.067 --> 01:39.033
her absence has left the sight
uninhabited and unprotected.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.033
SUE: I have to visually
check everything.

01:42.100 --> 01:43.967
Behind any corner,
any trailer,

01:44.033 --> 01:46.833
it's the things you don't see
that bite ya in the ass.

01:50.267 --> 01:52.033
I got injured, in the winter,

01:52.100 --> 01:54.033
and it was very cold
and very snowy in winter.

01:54.367 --> 01:57.133
I've been down
through the flooding.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.533
Four months have thawed out.

01:58.600 --> 02:01.500
It has gone through
the awakening of the bears.

02:01.567 --> 02:04.867
There's 83 bears tagged
within so many miles of camp

02:04.933 --> 02:06.100
that can walk through.

02:06.167 --> 02:08.067
I can't go in unarmed in case

02:08.133 --> 02:10.500
something decides to take me
out of the equation.

02:14.500 --> 02:16.233
You got a scratch here.

02:16.300 --> 02:17.933
That's been torn.

02:18.233 --> 02:20.167
How do you know it's new?
Well it's a different colour.

02:20.233 --> 02:21.233
It's bright yellow.

02:21.300 --> 02:22.633
All the other wood
is weathered,

02:22.700 --> 02:23.733
this is yellowish.

02:25.800 --> 02:27.667
Can't say if it's a bear,
can't say what it is.

02:27.733 --> 02:29.833
It's just that...

02:29.900 --> 02:31.200
I don't see
where the building isn't,

02:31.267 --> 02:32.567
it has been, uh,

02:32.633 --> 02:34.700
the integrity has not been
compromised on the building.

02:35.500 --> 02:37.900
But you can see
something pushed.

02:41.833 --> 02:45.000
Okay, I don't see any breaks
in the material.

02:47.867 --> 02:49.233
Time to go in the Twinkie.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.200
Dark in here, man.

03:00.967 --> 03:03.267
The door back here
is still shut.

03:03.333 --> 03:05.200
So that's good.

03:05.500 --> 03:09.300
All's I'm looking for,
did something open a door?

03:09.367 --> 03:10.800
Is there a problem?

03:10.867 --> 03:13.567
I don't care if the bears come
scratch, scratch, scratch.

03:13.633 --> 03:15.300
I care about open, open, open.

03:18.567 --> 03:20.967
So, everything's looking
pretty good.

03:21.033 --> 03:24.800
And uh, (GIGGLES) silly
as it seems,

03:24.867 --> 03:26.500
this right here,

03:26.567 --> 03:28.467
coffee grounds
that I spread everywhere.

03:29.467 --> 03:31.933
What it does,
a bear's nose is so sensitive,

03:32.000 --> 03:34.933
that mild acidic scent
is just like an outhouse.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.367
They don't like it.

03:36.433 --> 03:39.767
It is a miracle
that I was able to be gone

03:39.833 --> 03:41.500
and no bears came in.

03:41.567 --> 03:44.500
They scratched
and they didn't destroy it.

03:44.567 --> 03:45.967
Um, that is,

03:48.200 --> 03:50.367
it's pretty amazing. I feel
proud of myself for that.

03:50.633 --> 03:53.100
I'm one lucky bitch in camp.
Nothing ate it.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.800
But I got a lotta
clean up to do.

03:57.333 --> 03:58.867
CHIP:
To us, this is living rich.

03:58.933 --> 04:00.467
This is adventure
and time with my family.

04:00.533 --> 04:02.367
Ain't no amount of money
can ever get to hold that.

04:08.633 --> 04:10.200
My name is Agnes Hailstone.

04:10.267 --> 04:11.733
I am married
to Edward Hailstone.

04:11.800 --> 04:12.833
We call him Chip.

04:13.767 --> 04:15.967
I'm Edward Hailstone.
I'm a subsistence hunter.

04:16.033 --> 04:18.567
I'm a subsistence gatherer,
fisherman.

04:18.633 --> 04:21.167
I'm married to Agnes,
and I have five daughters.

04:21.433 --> 04:23.767
I try to get 'em all involved
in everything from caribou,

04:23.833 --> 04:25.967
to seals in the ocean,
to fish in the river,

04:26.033 --> 04:27.067
to birds flying overhead,

04:27.133 --> 04:28.367
to digging stuff
out of the ground.

04:28.733 --> 04:30.067
We gotta be kind of nomadic,

04:30.133 --> 04:32.700
and change our camps,
and go where the animals are.

04:32.767 --> 04:33.900
Or we have to go
where the fish are,

04:33.967 --> 04:34.967
or we have to go
where the plants

04:35.033 --> 04:36.400
are blooming, or the berries.

04:36.467 --> 04:39.500
And sometimes we have to go
where the weather tells us to.

04:39.567 --> 04:41.333
So, we're spending the spring
here in the Kiwalik

04:41.400 --> 04:43.500
'cause this, to us,
is the place to be.

04:43.567 --> 04:45.300
-Hi, Dad.
-Hello, Bun.

NARRATOR: Warm temperatures
and long days

04:48.033 --> 04:51.200
allow the Hailstones to live
off the land in Kiwalik.

04:51.600 --> 04:52.867
They'll spend
the summer harvesting

04:52.933 --> 04:54.967
the area's vast resources,

04:55.033 --> 04:57.600
in order to survive
the harsh winter ahead.

important things to do.

04:59.600 --> 05:00.667
We're gonna
have to set up the tents,

05:00.733 --> 05:01.767
we're gonna
have to set up our kitchen.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.100
Gonna have to go get some

05:03.167 --> 05:05.200
willows and grasses
to make our beds.

05:05.267 --> 05:07.300
Just generally set
things up the way we like 'em

05:07.367 --> 05:08.900
in the summertime
and be here till August.

05:08.967 --> 05:11.600
AGNES: Okay, we got to start
moving before
the weather come.

05:11.667 --> 05:13.667
Towards evening
it's gonna get cold

05:13.733 --> 05:15.667
and start getting moist.

05:15.733 --> 05:17.600
CHIP: One, two three,
let's go.

05:17.667 --> 05:19.033
All together.

05:19.100 --> 05:20.533
-Should I push?
-Uh, up to you.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.967
-I need like, uh...
-You need, you could...

05:23.033 --> 05:24.233
CHIP: Yep, hold onto
a rope babe,

05:24.300 --> 05:25.500
that's all you gotta do.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.533
CHIP: Yep. It's bulky
is what it is, okay?

05:28.600 --> 05:30.100
Okay, stop you guys.

05:30.333 --> 05:32.300
-Oh wait, dad you see that?
-Oh, those are caribou!

05:34.200 --> 05:35.500
Look at that.
We missed 'em!

05:35.900 --> 05:37.900
CHIP: It's a pretty
tough sell.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.767
I think we probably should
just stick with the job

05:39.833 --> 05:41.933
we're doing and hope
they come a little closer.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.533
Let's keep going,
one, two, three, go.

05:44.533 --> 05:46.300
CHIP: If I wanted
to go after caribou,

05:46.367 --> 05:47.467
that would
be a considerable effort

05:47.533 --> 05:49.133
and a considerable
amount of time.

05:49.533 --> 05:51.600
To go up there,
to run something down,

05:51.667 --> 05:53.433
carry it back here
would be exhausting.

05:53.500 --> 05:56.633
And then to have to put up
the tepee and the tent,
that'd be even worse.

05:56.700 --> 05:59.000
So the whole idea is that once
we got the tepee
and the tent up,

05:59.067 --> 06:00.800
then I can run off.

06:00.867 --> 06:03.933
I can go get firewood,
I can go chase caribou.
I can go do all that stuff.

06:05.233 --> 06:07.667
-Keep it going forward, love.
-Oh, it's far away.

06:07.733 --> 06:09.667
Be careful, it's deep over
here on this side.

06:09.733 --> 06:11.500
-(SHRIEKS) Ah!
-I warned ya.

06:11.600 --> 06:13.267
CHIP: Getting our tents up
is the number one thing.

06:13.333 --> 06:16.400
If we have our tents up,
then we're able to operate,
stay dry.

06:17.400 --> 06:19.367
Without a good place to stay,
ain't no fun.

06:19.433 --> 06:21.400
There we go, right there.

06:21.933 --> 06:23.000
Okay.

06:23.067 --> 06:25.200
(SIGHS) Well, it's gonna rain,
you guys.

06:25.267 --> 06:28.067

and let's make a place
to cover our stuffs.

we gotta fix em.

06:34.667 --> 06:36.033

to have shelter,

06:36.100 --> 06:37.767
as fast as you can.
We've got rain coming.

06:37.833 --> 06:38.867
And we have
tons of work to do.

06:38.933 --> 06:40.400
But what we do
is we cover our bases first

06:40.467 --> 06:42.733
so that if anything happens,
we got a home.

06:43.900 --> 06:45.267
(CHIPPING)

06:47.600 --> 06:49.200

06:49.267 --> 06:51.533
Look like you all be, secure.

06:52.600 --> 06:54.767
It's gonna hold for the rest
of the summer.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
So we're gonna just uh,
knock off for the night

06:57.067 --> 07:00.233
and we'll start out
in the morning
and see what we come up with.

this lifestyle if I don't work
my butt off

07:07.100 --> 07:08.300
to make it possible.

07:22.500 --> 07:23.833
My name is Jessie Holmes.

07:24.533 --> 07:27.167
When I was young,
things just weren't
working for me.

07:27.267 --> 07:31.400
I was a real rambler.
I couldn't stay still,
I couldn't stay in one town.

07:31.867 --> 07:33.967
I got myself
into a lot of trouble,

07:34.033 --> 07:36.100
and I realised I needed
to turn that around quick

07:36.167 --> 07:39.567
and go back to
the genuine thing in me,
that was just like calling

07:39.633 --> 07:42.233
for like quiet,
peace, and wilderness.

07:42.767 --> 07:44.967
So, like, I directed my life,

07:45.033 --> 07:48.867
to correcting that and going
back to what I knew I needed
and wanted.

07:49.700 --> 07:52.267
And you know, now,
I just strive to live

07:52.333 --> 07:54.867
a simple lifestyle here
on the Nenana River.

07:55.200 --> 07:57.867
Running my dogs,
trapping, hunting, fishing.

07:57.933 --> 08:00.533
Doing whatever it takes
to maintain this lifestyle.

08:00.967 --> 08:03.367
I'm a lucky man
to live the way I do,

08:03.433 --> 08:04.933
and I thank God
for it every day.

08:08.067 --> 08:09.633
You ready for me to cook
for you?

08:13.667 --> 08:16.567
I'm gonna cook up
some dog food for my dogs.

08:17.233 --> 08:19.367
I'm gonna add
a bunch of meat in here.

08:22.133 --> 08:24.033
Now, I'll throw a couple
of these fish in here,

08:24.100 --> 08:25.733
just to give
that good fish flavour.

08:25.800 --> 08:28.167
This is the last
of the dry fish that I had.

08:28.233 --> 08:30.100
This was put away last fall.

08:30.167 --> 08:31.933
Running out and, uh,

08:32.000 --> 08:34.200
it's time to start
catching some more fish.

08:34.267 --> 08:35.567
NARRATOR: For Jessie Holmes,

08:35.633 --> 08:37.100
getting his fish wheel
in the water

08:37.167 --> 08:40.067
for the chum salmon
run is crucial.

08:40.133 --> 08:41.800
If he's not able
to catch fish,

08:41.867 --> 08:43.400
he won't be able
to feed his dog team.

08:44.067 --> 08:45.733
JESSIE: It's really critical
that I do this,

08:45.800 --> 08:47.867
because
I can't afford to, like,

08:47.933 --> 08:49.667
feed these dogs
through the winter.

08:49.733 --> 08:52.067
I have almost,
close to 40 dogs.

08:52.467 --> 08:54.500
If you were feeding them
a dry commercial kibble,

08:54.567 --> 08:57.533
it'd be, like, you know,
$45, $50 a day.

08:58.267 --> 09:00.300
I'm gonna
close this lid tight.

09:00.367 --> 09:01.933
It'll all steam
and cook together

09:02.000 --> 09:03.833
and make a nice meal
for the dogs.

How you doing, Doggy?

09:16.633 --> 09:17.967
Sled dogs are probably what

09:18.033 --> 09:20.700
held me to the land in Alaska.

09:20.800 --> 09:23.733
I usually do about
four to five races a year

09:23.800 --> 09:25.067
with the dogs, and, uh,

09:25.133 --> 09:26.567
that's one of the ways
that I subsist

09:26.633 --> 09:28.433
up here with my dog team.

09:28.500 --> 09:31.667
Try to see my dogs
make me as much money back

09:31.733 --> 09:34.533
that I spend and put into them
as they possibly can.

09:34.967 --> 09:37.733
That's just to help me
maintain this.

09:37.867 --> 09:40.833
Tates, what you doing, huh?

09:40.900 --> 09:42.933
Hey, yeah. You hungry?

09:44.067 --> 09:46.133
Oh, yeah, look at that.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.967
I try to kill two birds
with one stone
with everything I do.

09:49.033 --> 09:51.767
So when I'm feeding my dogs,
I want to give them that
positive attention.

09:51.833 --> 09:54.000
Let 'em know I care
about each one of 'em.

09:54.067 --> 09:56.233
I don't want to just do it
like it's a job, you know?

09:56.300 --> 09:58.533
It's like going to work
and not getting

09:58.600 --> 10:00.067
an honest day in. You know?

10:00.133 --> 10:03.200
Like, if I'm here,
I want em to know
that it's for them.

10:04.100 --> 10:05.167
Good boy, Copper.

10:09.900 --> 10:13.400
If I'm having a bad day,
I come out here and feed
these dogs in the evening

10:13.467 --> 10:16.667
and whenever it's done,
I feel like I just went
to therapy.

10:19.700 --> 10:22.100
I love seeing my dogs
and I love feeding them

10:22.167 --> 10:24.633
the best food
that I possibly can.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.500
I think when
you got this many dogs,

10:26.567 --> 10:28.333
your life needs
to revolve around them.

10:28.400 --> 10:31.733
They need constant
care and attention,
and they deserve it.

10:31.800 --> 10:34.033
Labour of love,
that's what this is.

10:39.133 --> 10:42.400
GLENN: Different experience
of time, different experience
of space.

10:42.467 --> 10:45.567
It's a very different
consciousness living out here
than it is living in town.

10:51.967 --> 10:54.800
My name's Glenn Villeneuve.
I've always enjoyed living
out in the wilderness,

10:54.867 --> 10:58.000
so I moved up to Alaska
15 years ago to live out
in the Brooks Range.

11:01.600 --> 11:04.633
I was looking all over
the world for a place to live
close to nature like this,

11:04.700 --> 11:05.867
and I ended up, up here.

11:09.567 --> 11:11.667
What a beautiful day.
Springtime.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.367
Lake's already starting
to thaw out.

11:18.667 --> 11:21.067
I hear all
the little songbirds out there
singing this morning.

11:22.933 --> 11:24.467
Heard some ducks quacking.

11:24.533 --> 11:26.133
Birds flying into the valley.

11:28.833 --> 11:29.967
The leaves are coming out,

11:30.033 --> 11:31.800
what a great time of year
it is out here.

11:34.133 --> 11:35.667
A lot of the animals aren't
available to me.

11:35.733 --> 11:37.033
The caribou have headed
further north.

11:37.100 --> 11:39.033
I probably won't see
any more caribou this year.

11:40.167 --> 11:42.167
The only caribou meat I have,
I had to dry.

11:42.233 --> 11:43.633
So I'm just eating
dry caribou meat

11:43.700 --> 11:45.533
because I can't keep
it frozen any more.

11:46.100 --> 11:47.233
But at this time of year,

11:47.300 --> 11:48.833
I turn my attention
to smaller animals.

11:48.900 --> 11:50.267
Things that
I can consume faster

11:50.333 --> 11:52.333
so that preservation
isn't such a problem.

11:52.400 --> 11:53.900
And that's what I'm gonna
be looking for today.

12:00.267 --> 12:02.000
In the spring,
when the lake starts to melt,

12:02.067 --> 12:03.667
the first ice to go
is around the edge.

12:05.400 --> 12:07.033
A moat opens up.

12:07.100 --> 12:09.700
That concentrates the ducks,
'cause the first ducks
coming in

12:09.767 --> 12:12.467
are gonna have to land in this
narrow channel of water,

12:12.533 --> 12:14.033
right along the edge
of the lake.

12:14.100 --> 12:15.200
That's where I'm gonna
hunt today.

12:32.333 --> 12:34.567
No ducks.

12:34.633 --> 12:35.633
Just got to keep looking.

12:38.733 --> 12:41.233
It's not uncommon for me
to walk a couple miles
and not see a duck.

12:41.300 --> 12:43.000
So, it's nothing
out of the ordinary.

12:43.067 --> 12:44.867
It's the same
with all the other game.

12:44.933 --> 12:47.267
Way up here in the Arctic,
there's less life
that the land can support,

12:47.333 --> 12:49.433
so you have to travel more
country in order to get it.

12:59.200 --> 13:01.533
(WHISPERING) There's
some ducks right there.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.833
I stay behind this spruce tree
and they won't see me,

13:03.900 --> 13:06.500
but there's several ducks
right up here.

13:07.033 --> 13:09.100
About 75 yards
from the ducks right now.

13:13.100 --> 13:16.433
I got to get closer to 'em
in order to get a shot.

13:22.800 --> 13:24.567
If I just go straight
over this hill

13:24.633 --> 13:26.033
I think they're gonna see me
really quickly

13:26.100 --> 13:27.700
and take off before
I can get close enough.

13:32.867 --> 13:33.867
(GUN SHOT FIRED)

13:42.400 --> 13:43.533
That duck's been hit.

13:49.067 --> 13:50.500
I just got to kill him
and get him back.

14:01.200 --> 14:03.733
My strategy is to keep
a very close eye on that duck.

14:03.800 --> 14:04.967
Try and recover it.

14:05.033 --> 14:07.333
Trick now is gonna
be not to lose sight of it.

14:08.067 --> 14:09.200
(PANTING)

14:14.033 --> 14:15.300
I got it!

14:18.433 --> 14:20.567
Got the duck.
That one almost got away.

14:26.133 --> 14:29.067
Nothing like sitting out here
beside the lake,
plucking a duck.

14:30.333 --> 14:32.633
It's more than just getting
the ducks,
it's just being out here

14:32.700 --> 14:34.100
and enjoying
this time of year.

14:34.200 --> 14:36.133
Listen to all the new sounds.

14:36.200 --> 14:37.967
Winter's very quiet.

14:39.700 --> 14:41.167
The springtime,
it gets noisier,

14:41.233 --> 14:42.233
the birds come back,

14:42.300 --> 14:43.833
the wind just rustling
in the grass,

14:43.900 --> 14:45.133
and the vegetation,
that's different.

14:46.900 --> 14:49.200
Everything's moving again.

14:49.267 --> 14:50.533
Water's moving.

14:50.600 --> 14:52.833
It's a different pace of life.

14:56.467 --> 14:57.500
GLENN: Oh!

15:02.033 --> 15:04.133
There's some more shovelers
right up here.

15:14.567 --> 15:15.667
(GUNSHOT FIRED)

15:19.700 --> 15:22.633
Three shovelers just came in.
I got one of the drakes
right here.

15:23.300 --> 15:24.500
It flew right in here
in front of me.

15:26.400 --> 15:28.700
Got another northern shoveler.

15:29.800 --> 15:31.900
Turning out to be a good day
of duck hunting out here.

15:38.467 --> 15:43.967
SUE: You have an opportunity
to say this will define me
or I will overcome it.

15:53.400 --> 15:54.533
NARRATOR: For Sue Aikens,

15:54.600 --> 15:56.467
maintaining her food supply
in Kavik

15:56.533 --> 15:58.833
is critical to keeping
her camp up and running.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.267
Any loss of food stock
or equipment

16:01.333 --> 16:04.600
will cost thousands of dollars
to replace and transport.

16:05.833 --> 16:07.367
SUE: For me,
I look around camp,

16:09.233 --> 16:12.000
and it's mind blowing
the amount of work
I have to do.

16:12.067 --> 16:14.633
I'm back
after four months in town.

16:14.700 --> 16:16.200
The land was frozen
when I left.

16:16.267 --> 16:18.133
It has gone through the thaw.

16:18.200 --> 16:20.833
I have nine freezers,
four refrigerators

16:20.900 --> 16:23.467
that I should have been there
running electricity
as it got warmer

16:23.533 --> 16:25.433
to keep it cold and frozen.

16:25.500 --> 16:26.933
I wasn't.

16:30.200 --> 16:32.367
Ugh. Fucking hell.

16:33.167 --> 16:35.167
Yeah, this is gonna
be the travesty.

16:35.467 --> 16:36.967
Gone.

16:37.033 --> 16:38.633
Gone.

16:38.700 --> 16:39.800
Gone.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.933
We got one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight

16:44.000 --> 16:47.200
freezers. Three of the fridges
are bad.

16:47.700 --> 16:51.367
It's rotten,
I want that food out,
away from camp.

16:53.400 --> 16:55.367
What the state wants me to do,

16:55.433 --> 16:58.733
take all the, um,
biodegradable products.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.600
Take it to the end
of the airstrip,

17:00.667 --> 17:01.967
cut it out of the packaging
and dump it.

17:02.533 --> 17:04.267
Get it in the water,
it'll dilute the scent.

17:05.567 --> 17:10.400
For now that I've opened it,
I have to, I must, priority,
keep going.

17:10.467 --> 17:13.867
That scent is going to alert
the animals in the area.

17:13.933 --> 17:16.533
They can't help it,
that's what they do.
They're animals, and,

17:16.600 --> 17:17.967
and this is a possible
food source.

17:26.033 --> 17:29.267
This is the personally,
the most heart-breaking area.

17:29.333 --> 17:31.467
This is the food
that I hunt for.

17:36.267 --> 17:38.567
The total revenue probably,

17:38.633 --> 17:41.467
probably lost
around $18,000 in food.

17:41.733 --> 17:44.633
This is all my, all my hunting
from last year.

17:46.067 --> 17:47.900
I'm gonna get up on the roof
and just do a visual,

17:47.967 --> 17:50.833
I wanna know if something's
coming at me or it isn't.

17:50.900 --> 17:52.700
That's where
the scent is being blown,

17:52.767 --> 17:54.600
so that's
where I really wanna see.

18:01.800 --> 18:04.167
All right, I don't see
any ominous threat.

18:08.667 --> 18:11.133
AGNES: We've gone ahead,
we think of the next season.

18:11.200 --> 18:13.933
We think
of the other opportunities
that are heading our way.

18:16.800 --> 18:18.233
AGNES: Ah...

18:18.800 --> 18:21.667
Hey. Look like a good day eh?

18:21.733 --> 18:22.833
Long as the wind stays up

18:22.900 --> 18:25.500
and keeps the mosquitoes away,
it's a good day.

18:25.600 --> 18:27.567
We still got lots to do, eh?

18:27.633 --> 18:29.267
We got to make this mess
into a home.

18:29.967 --> 18:33.700
NARRATOR: The Hailstones
have arrived at their summer
hunting grounds in Kiwalik.

18:33.767 --> 18:37.200
It is imperative
that the family secures meat
for the days ahead.

18:37.367 --> 18:40.200
We just got here yesterday
and, um,
there's a lot of action here.

18:40.567 --> 18:43.100
There's caribous
crossing the rivers,
there's birds flying over.

18:43.167 --> 18:46.333
So we just want to keep
building up camp,
try to get done.

18:46.400 --> 18:49.400
Get all our wood and our water
and everything set up here

18:49.467 --> 18:52.833
so we can just go
and do our hunt
and go get some food.

18:52.933 --> 18:55.967
Everybody's excited
and wanting to hurry up
and get done,

18:56.033 --> 18:57.500
and just, go play.

18:58.233 --> 19:00.267
Let's go.
Help me go get water.

19:00.333 --> 19:02.333
You too Mary.
Grab that bucket over there.

19:04.533 --> 19:06.867
We are getting water.
We call it Imatauk.

19:06.933 --> 19:09.000
We go get our water.
Go get it from the river.

19:11.700 --> 19:15.333
Here we don't have sinks,
and a water system,
and all that.

19:15.400 --> 19:17.867
So this is our water system,
it's this river.

19:18.367 --> 19:21.000
We're gonna get water while
it's early since
we all just got up,

19:21.067 --> 19:23.400
and then later on
like when we're cooking,

19:23.467 --> 19:26.033
or when we want to drink
it later on,
it'll all be settled,

19:26.100 --> 19:28.167
and it'll
all be crystal-clear.

19:28.233 --> 19:30.267
That's enough water, let's go.

19:30.767 --> 19:32.700
They're getting water.
They're looking for firewood.

19:32.967 --> 19:35.733
The girls are keeping
their eyes open for

19:35.800 --> 19:38.200
caribou, for any other game
animals around,

19:38.267 --> 19:41.800
and, um, we just keep the day
chugging along.

19:42.133 --> 19:44.400
Mom! Mom!

19:44.700 --> 19:46.700
-See? Yeah there.
-AGNES: Mud creek side?

19:46.767 --> 19:48.867
They're... They're
on the other side of,

19:48.933 --> 19:50.033
right there.

19:50.100 --> 19:51.367
They're like right
where their backs

19:51.433 --> 19:53.267
meet the
willow line perfectly,

19:53.333 --> 19:54.433
you could
just see their backs.

20:05.300 --> 20:07.500
CHIP: We're not
shooting calves.
We're not shooting cows.

20:07.567 --> 20:08.967
But the one in the back
is a young bull.

20:09.033 --> 20:11.300
The young bull
is on this side.
But if you aim at him,

20:11.367 --> 20:12.800
you'll have
to aim mid-stomach,

20:12.867 --> 20:14.500
so that the bullet
drifts into his chest.

20:25.200 --> 20:26.567
AGNES: Okay, goody.

20:27.233 --> 20:29.067
CHIP: Just let out
your breath and relax.

20:31.933 --> 20:33.700
-Ooh!
-CHIP: Just over.

20:35.233 --> 20:37.200
Move aside.

20:37.267 --> 20:38.500
Now?

20:38.800 --> 20:40.667
-Down?
-Down. Down lower.

20:44.600 --> 20:46.100
-(SHRIEKS)
-CHIP: Dang.

20:46.167 --> 20:48.833
AGNES: I got it!
This is a good first hunt.

20:49.167 --> 20:51.933
We don't really have any meat
in the camp right now so, um,

20:52.000 --> 20:54.833
we'll be able to haul
this back to camp

20:55.033 --> 20:56.433
and have some good dinner.

20:56.500 --> 20:58.200
Heart and tongue,
and some other good stuff.

21:00.400 --> 21:02.333
Tongue is the best part of...

21:02.400 --> 21:05.467
Or one of the best pieces
of a kid's choice piece,

21:05.533 --> 21:06.867
as they call it.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.433
Every day's
a learning experience

21:08.500 --> 21:10.100
for these girls. Even me.

21:10.167 --> 21:12.200
I try to tell them even
though I'm old,

21:12.267 --> 21:13.733
I still learn something
new every day.

21:14.633 --> 21:16.100
See the ribs where I'm getting
'em on the knuckles?

21:16.267 --> 21:18.300
-Yeah.
-Then I can open the chest up.

21:19.067 --> 21:20.500
I can get to the heart
and stuff easier.

21:20.567 --> 21:22.167
It hinges right open.
See that?

21:22.233 --> 21:24.500
CHIP: I want my kids to know
how to take care
of themselves.

21:24.733 --> 21:27.367
It's more, and more, and more
options actually for them,

21:27.433 --> 21:28.567
through the education
we give 'em.

21:30.200 --> 21:32.800
It's all along the lines
of not giving them the fish

21:32.867 --> 21:34.233
but teaching them to fish.

21:36.400 --> 21:38.500
I got to catch up the girls,
looks like they're doing
all the work.

21:38.933 --> 21:41.733
You know,
we've got our camp up,
we've got our stuff out.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.800
We're sorting through things,
we're putting camp together

21:43.867 --> 21:45.567
and making
it a better place every day,

21:45.633 --> 21:48.033
and this is part of it,
is having fresh food on hand.

21:52.267 --> 21:54.367
JESSIE: You pretty much just
have to pay attention
all the time,

21:54.433 --> 21:57.367
'cause it's always
the unforeseen that's gonna
catch you off guard.

22:06.700 --> 22:09.733
Just getting
my morning started here
with a cup of coffee.

22:09.800 --> 22:12.400
Gonna get out here,
start working on this boat.

22:12.467 --> 22:14.333
I got some holes
in it that I need to repair.

22:14.567 --> 22:16.800
Gonna try to get it in the
water here next couple days,

22:16.867 --> 22:18.867
so I can get out,
and build a new fish wheel.

22:18.933 --> 22:21.500
So I can start putting away
some fish for my dogs
this fall.

22:21.567 --> 22:23.767
I try to live very simple,
that way I can afford

22:23.833 --> 22:25.800
to put most of my money
into my dogs

22:25.867 --> 22:28.367
and racing sled dogs
in the winter.

22:28.933 --> 22:32.367
Hi Tobias. What you doing?
Ready to go to work?

22:32.967 --> 22:35.133
This is my boat,
it's a 24-foot long,

22:35.200 --> 22:38.233
four-foot wide,
narrow riverboat.

22:38.533 --> 22:40.667
If I don't get this boat fixed
and in the water,

22:40.733 --> 22:42.467
there's, like, no way
that I'm gonna be able

22:42.533 --> 22:44.600
to afford to have these
sled dogs this winter.

22:44.667 --> 22:47.400
The goal is to catch
about 3,500 to 4,000 fish.

22:47.900 --> 22:49.733
I'd have to like sell at least
half of my dogs

22:49.800 --> 22:52.133
if I had to just afford
to do this without fish.

22:53.733 --> 22:55.867
So I have a hole here
and a hole in the side.

22:55.933 --> 22:58.167
So I had to patch those holes,

22:58.233 --> 22:59.867
get this thing ready
to get on the river.

23:00.967 --> 23:03.500
One thing that's important
to me about living out here,

23:03.567 --> 23:05.533
fixing my own boat
and building my own boat

23:05.600 --> 23:07.800
and my own sleds,
it's just my belief system

23:07.867 --> 23:10.067
and like
being self-sufficient.

23:10.133 --> 23:13.267
I learned carpentry skills
when I came up to Alaska.

23:13.333 --> 23:17.267
Just started taking every job
I could and dove right
into it.

23:18.500 --> 23:19.667
Making progress.

23:19.733 --> 23:22.600
I need to flip this boat up
on the other side

23:22.667 --> 23:25.367
so I can start working
on patching my holes.

23:25.433 --> 23:27.167
This is kind
of a challenging thing,

23:27.233 --> 23:28.433
'cause I don't have help

23:28.500 --> 23:30.033
and I have to figure out
how to do it by myself.

23:30.100 --> 23:32.467
So, I'm really hoping
this'll work pretty quick.

23:33.133 --> 23:35.633
The main thing you want to do
is not get hurt.

23:35.700 --> 23:38.400
And the other main thing
I want to do
is not break my boat.

23:38.467 --> 23:40.400
I mean, if I were to buy
a boat that was built,

23:40.467 --> 23:43.233
it'd be like $3,000,
$4,000.

23:43.300 --> 23:45.800
Built this one
out of $1,000
worth of material.

23:45.867 --> 23:47.933
It's a subsistence boat
for me.

23:48.133 --> 23:51.033
I use it to get logs,
build fish wheels with it,

23:51.100 --> 23:52.467
I fish for my dogs with it.

23:52.533 --> 23:54.667
It's very important for me
to be able to put away food

23:54.733 --> 23:56.367
for the winter
for my dogs and myself.

23:56.933 --> 23:58.633
I don't necessarily
know how to do this.

23:58.700 --> 24:00.267
I don't necessarily know
how to do a lot of things.

24:00.333 --> 24:03.000
But I'll feel pretty proud
of myself if it works out

24:03.067 --> 24:05.067
and be pretty frustrated
if it doesn't.

24:05.133 --> 24:06.533
My idea is to just keep

24:06.600 --> 24:08.167
tightening this up
as I lift up,

24:08.233 --> 24:10.667
so it can't come back down

24:10.733 --> 24:13.700
too far on me and crush me.

24:14.100 --> 24:15.867
Oh, shit.

24:17.600 --> 24:19.700
I can't afford
to get the materials

24:19.767 --> 24:21.833
to build a new one,
or to buy one.

24:21.900 --> 24:23.300
Sometimes you're
just against it

24:23.367 --> 24:24.467
and you got to figure it out.

24:24.533 --> 24:25.933
I'm just gonna
have to pick this thing up.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.333
I think I got it.

24:27.400 --> 24:29.100
I hope this rope's gonna catch
it so it doesn't go over.

24:29.167 --> 24:30.400
(GROANS)

24:34.633 --> 24:35.633
(GRUNTS)

24:36.600 --> 24:40.600
Sometimes you just
got to go for shit.
Hope it works out.

24:43.467 --> 24:44.633
Damn.

24:44.700 --> 24:45.967
Holy Mother.

24:46.600 --> 24:47.800
Oh.

24:49.400 --> 24:51.067
It's holding,
it seems like it's holding.

24:55.400 --> 24:56.900
Oh, shit!

24:58.467 --> 24:59.500
Yeah!

24:59.567 --> 25:00.833
Worked!

25:01.833 --> 25:02.933
Phew.

25:03.867 --> 25:05.400
That was scary.

25:06.533 --> 25:09.033
Now that I've got the boat
flipped up on this side,

25:09.100 --> 25:10.767
I'm gonna
get to patching these holes.

25:10.867 --> 25:12.867
Just gonna
be in the water soon, I hope.

25:12.933 --> 25:15.600
NARRATOR: Jessie relies
on the returns
from his fish wheel

25:15.667 --> 25:17.767
to feed his team of sled dogs.

25:18.300 --> 25:22.867
With the summer chum salmon
run approaching, it is crucial
for Jessie to get his boat

25:22.933 --> 25:25.500
into working condition
and into the river.

25:25.567 --> 25:28.700
So what I'm gonna do is...
I would like to haul
my boat down with my truck,

25:28.767 --> 25:30.900
but I don't have
a ball hitch on my truck.

25:30.967 --> 25:34.067
I'm thinking I'm gonna
attach this bicycle to it,

25:34.133 --> 25:37.033
so I give myself
a front-wheel steering system.

25:38.900 --> 25:42.100
It's pretty much
the best option
I got at this moment.

25:47.833 --> 25:49.833
I don't quite know
how I'm gonna do this yet but,

25:50.300 --> 25:52.933
this is the challenge
about doing things
by yourself.

25:53.233 --> 25:54.733
It's somewhat dangerous.

25:54.800 --> 25:55.833
I gotta get this boat down

25:55.900 --> 25:57.300
in the Nenana River
to launch it,

25:57.367 --> 26:00.033
and it's only about 150 yards
from here,

26:00.100 --> 26:03.200
so I just have
to make this work to there.

26:03.767 --> 26:05.300
All right. Here goes nothing.

26:09.600 --> 26:10.733
(GRUNTS)

26:12.233 --> 26:13.467
(GRUNTS)

26:15.400 --> 26:16.433
Oh!

26:17.000 --> 26:18.633
Whoa! Ah, fuck!

26:19.833 --> 26:21.233
All right.

26:21.300 --> 26:22.867
Whew, this poor bike.

26:26.067 --> 26:27.100
Okay.

26:27.167 --> 26:28.800
It feels like I'm going
kind of.

26:30.467 --> 26:33.300
The best feeling for me
at the end of the day is,

26:33.367 --> 26:35.367
you know,
knowing that I worked hard,

26:35.433 --> 26:37.533
feel tired enough
to go to sleep, you know.

26:37.600 --> 26:40.567
It took me three days of work
to finish up this boat,

26:40.633 --> 26:42.833
and now the reward
is a couple summers

26:42.900 --> 26:44.733
on the river
doing what I love.

26:47.400 --> 26:49.900
All right,
that worked just good.

26:50.567 --> 26:51.700
Actually turned
out to be perfect

26:51.767 --> 26:53.967
'cause I had brakes,
I had steering.

26:54.033 --> 26:56.300
I really didn't think
it'd go that good.

26:56.633 --> 26:59.233
Today's been a long day.
It's already late in the day.

26:59.300 --> 27:01.533
It's been a lot of work
getting this
boat flipped over.

27:01.600 --> 27:03.367
I had to do it all by hand.

27:03.433 --> 27:06.333
Once this boat's in the water,
this is really the start
of summer for me.

27:07.300 --> 27:10.333
It's time to really
get a lot done
out on the river and,

27:10.400 --> 27:13.000
hopefully put up a lot of food
for me and the dogs.

27:14.033 --> 27:15.967
Still got to get this boat
in the water.

27:20.333 --> 27:23.067
AGNES: We're able
to live together,
work together,

27:23.133 --> 27:25.333
and it just makes
us even stronger.

27:27.767 --> 27:30.100
AGNES: Take a shovel, Mary.
Let's go, Qutan, Irene.

27:30.367 --> 27:32.700
CHIP: The ladies here
are gonna go pick
some of a root called mushua.

27:32.767 --> 27:34.333
And they grow all
over through here.

27:34.433 --> 27:36.300
A little bit of something
sweet, like, kind
of like a sweet potato.

27:36.367 --> 27:37.567
I think they call 'em
Eskimo potatoes.

27:38.100 --> 27:40.833
NARRATOR: After harvesting
a caribou for camp meat,

27:40.900 --> 27:42.433
the Hailstones
turn their attention

27:42.500 --> 27:44.900
to gathering another
Kiwalik resource

27:44.967 --> 27:46.200
mushua root.

27:46.267 --> 27:48.233
The time to do it is now.
If we don't get 'em now,

27:48.300 --> 27:49.567
all that good nutrients
and stuff

27:49.633 --> 27:50.867
that's in the root,
or that's inside

27:50.933 --> 27:52.000
these little branches
are gonna

27:52.067 --> 27:53.167
go into building the plant,

27:53.233 --> 27:54.633
'cause it's starting to grow.

27:54.700 --> 27:56.833
And then it'll be really chewy
and it'll taste terrible.

27:57.467 --> 28:00.200
And what we need is Vitamin C,
and we need to have
a change of diet.

28:00.267 --> 28:03.000
We need to have some starches
and we need to have
some fibre in our diet.

28:03.067 --> 28:05.167
And that's exactly
what this stuff will provide.

28:08.333 --> 28:10.867
AGNES: There should be mushua
right above the sandbar,

28:10.933 --> 28:13.033
so we're gonna
go target that area first.

28:13.500 --> 28:16.067
The mushua is gonna
be all along these edges,

28:16.133 --> 28:17.333
right along the edges.

28:17.400 --> 28:18.767
If you start to see, like,

28:18.833 --> 28:21.333
you see the light,
brownish peeled,

28:21.400 --> 28:24.667
um, roots,
then those would be mushua.

28:25.767 --> 28:28.333
Okay, kids, go on ahead
and start looking
for roots and stuff.

28:28.400 --> 28:29.633
What's this stuff, mom?

28:29.700 --> 28:31.667
Let me see, did you
find some already, Qutan?

28:31.833 --> 28:34.567
Let me get out.

28:34.667 --> 28:36.700
It's not.

28:36.767 --> 28:38.000
Yup, that is.

28:38.633 --> 28:39.833
See, you'll find them
like this.

28:39.900 --> 28:41.267
This is what we're
looking for.

28:41.333 --> 28:44.933
They have a plant like this,
and this is why we come here.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.633
This is, uh, mushua tuk,
and this is why

28:47.700 --> 28:49.900
we come to go pick
these mushuas here.

28:49.967 --> 28:51.800
It's because
this bank is full of 'em.

28:51.867 --> 28:54.967
Right now they're, um,
real good,
they're like, uh, potato

28:55.033 --> 28:56.533
and they're really good
to eat, and they're sweet.

28:56.600 --> 28:58.367
So, this is why we're here.

29:01.033 --> 29:03.933
It takes some effort
but once you hit a real,

29:04.000 --> 29:07.000
um, big patch,
usually it's easier

29:07.067 --> 29:10.033
to start picking a whole bunch
after but you just gotta

29:10.100 --> 29:11.433
pretty much find...

29:11.500 --> 29:12.800
Oh, that's all right.

29:12.867 --> 29:15.767
Oh, that's yummy,
that's a good one.

29:15.833 --> 29:17.800
Look how big.
You got bigger than mine.

29:18.700 --> 29:20.733
Right now, uh,
Qutan's just learning.

29:20.800 --> 29:23.500
So she's just getting
familiarized with the plants.

29:23.567 --> 29:24.900
We've pointed
them out for her,

29:24.967 --> 29:28.500
but this year she's actually,
um, looking for the plants

29:28.567 --> 29:30.167
to know where to dig, so.

29:30.233 --> 29:32.033
It's kind of fun watching her.

29:33.367 --> 29:34.400
Move your butt.

29:34.467 --> 29:36.333
Oh, look,
I just chopped it off.

29:38.833 --> 29:41.000
-Oops.
-Keep going, I see it still.

29:41.633 --> 29:44.900
The days like this
are why I love being out here.

29:44.967 --> 29:46.433
Just getting family time.

29:46.500 --> 29:48.867
Looking for food that we can,
you know,

29:48.933 --> 29:51.500
thrive on and just,
it's good to get out of camp

29:51.567 --> 29:53.500
for a little bit
and go do something different.

29:53.567 --> 29:55.467
This is awesome,
just being out here

29:55.533 --> 29:57.933
watching the girls
find this root

29:58.000 --> 30:01.667
and knowing the difference
between one root from another

30:01.733 --> 30:03.900
and, um,
just playing in the mud.

30:06.233 --> 30:08.300
Okay, girls, we've got quite
a bit actually,

30:08.367 --> 30:09.967
and this is probably
what we need.

30:10.033 --> 30:11.900
Let's get back to camp
and go have some dinner

30:11.967 --> 30:14.167
and show your guys'
dad what we found.

30:14.233 --> 30:15.333
Yeah.

30:18.033 --> 30:20.267
SUE: You don't prepare
for your best day in life,

30:20.333 --> 30:22.233
you got to prepare
for the worst.

30:26.733 --> 30:30.133
NARRATOR: Without electricity
in Kavik for the past
four months,

30:30.200 --> 30:32.833
Sue's food supply
has turned inedible.

30:32.900 --> 30:35.033
To keep predators
away from her camp,

30:35.100 --> 30:36.767
Sue has been
advised by the State

30:36.833 --> 30:39.567
to dispose of the spoiled food
down river.

30:39.767 --> 30:41.667
SUE: The visual says it all.

30:42.133 --> 30:44.667
That's not a healthy
freaking product.

30:44.733 --> 30:47.033
But the quality of what I buy

30:48.433 --> 30:50.467
is just outstanding.

30:50.533 --> 30:53.267
So it just hurts,
hurts, hurts, financially.

30:53.333 --> 30:55.633
But, you know
I put a lot of me.

30:55.700 --> 30:57.933
Kavik is me.
Ya know, I am Kavik.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.133
Synonymous.

30:59.200 --> 31:01.667
But I take a lot of pride
in offering people

31:01.733 --> 31:03.600
the best of the best
when they're out here.

31:04.233 --> 31:08.600
But I mean every single
little bit of this
is lost, lost, lost.

31:13.733 --> 31:15.700
I mean,
besides the disgusto factor,

31:16.667 --> 31:18.900
um, I mean

31:18.967 --> 31:21.633
it's an incredible amount
of revenue.

31:21.700 --> 31:24.167
How do you put a price tag
on the caribou?

31:24.233 --> 31:26.333
Or the fish
that I bartered for.

31:27.700 --> 31:30.100
Hard to put a value on that.

31:32.400 --> 31:33.600
You know,
if there's anything close,

31:33.667 --> 31:35.367
it's gonna
start getting interested.

31:35.433 --> 31:38.200
Bears, wolves, they don't mind
eating rotten food.

31:38.267 --> 31:39.500
And I just put up
the dinner bell.

31:47.833 --> 31:49.567
Just gonna be continuing
the process

31:49.633 --> 31:52.000
of getting all
of the rotten goods.

31:54.167 --> 31:55.667
Even though we're getting
it in the water

31:55.733 --> 31:57.267
so it distils the scent,

31:57.333 --> 31:58.967
it's gonna go downstream.

31:59.033 --> 32:01.467
There's no way
they won't smell it.

32:01.533 --> 32:03.367
That's why
once I start this I gotta,

32:03.433 --> 32:04.600
the fact that I opened 'em up

32:04.667 --> 32:06.333
and looked at it today,
I got to finish it today.

32:07.700 --> 32:08.800
Boom.

32:08.867 --> 32:09.967
Boom.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
SUE: I'm gonna get up on top.

32:19.067 --> 32:21.367
It was a little chilly,
so I threw on my sweatshirt.

32:26.833 --> 32:28.767
And we've
got a wolf on the runway.

32:28.833 --> 32:30.367
That's the area
I got to go to,

32:30.433 --> 32:31.933
that's the area
the wolf is at.

32:32.367 --> 32:35.033
Looks to me maybe
a juvenile female wolf

32:35.100 --> 32:39.067
on the runway, headed towards
where I had to dump
all that food.

32:39.133 --> 32:41.433
Little wolfie
on the spot there.

32:41.500 --> 32:42.667
Wolves are a pack animal.

32:42.733 --> 32:44.433
They don't
generally travel alone.

32:44.800 --> 32:46.433
Doesn't mean
they're not there.

32:46.500 --> 32:50.533
Not even 30 minutes
from when I tossed
the last rotten biscuit out,

32:51.200 --> 32:53.233
and here's a wolf.
Boom! On it.

32:53.600 --> 32:55.067
And that's exactly
what we were hoping,

32:55.133 --> 32:56.767
is get everything
away from camp.

32:57.300 --> 32:59.833
Now imagine
if I had families here
with little kids and

32:59.900 --> 33:03.367
your predator-human
interaction is,
is right there.

33:03.433 --> 33:04.633
That's how quick
it can happen.

33:04.700 --> 33:07.400
Nine times out of 10
the interaction with a wolf,

33:07.467 --> 33:09.033
I'll go out there and he'll...

33:09.100 --> 33:11.133
It'll get skid away
and then come back in.

33:11.200 --> 33:16.133
If it were a whole pack, I'd,
I'd probably just hold off
on my activities now.

33:18.800 --> 33:22.767
The sun doesn't set
so that works in my favour.
I'll just be tired and sore.

33:25.933 --> 33:27.833
CHIP: You know I want
to show my kids every season.

33:27.900 --> 33:30.933
And there's a different skill
and a different way
of doing things each time.

33:36.467 --> 33:38.267
Just making heart
and tongue soup.

33:38.333 --> 33:40.333
CHIP: This is the first meal
usually off of an animal.

33:40.400 --> 33:42.000
The tongue and the heart

33:42.067 --> 33:44.600
are organs that are small,

33:44.667 --> 33:46.733
full of fat,
really good tasting,

33:46.800 --> 33:49.167
different kind
of quality of meat.

33:49.233 --> 33:50.933
Throw some potatoes
and an onion in there.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.067
Now we can let this
all cook for quite a while.

33:54.133 --> 33:55.967
And then for dessert,
my wife and my daughters

33:56.033 --> 33:57.067
picked a bunch of mushua.

33:57.700 --> 33:59.867
We've had an all-around
profitable day, I'd say.

33:59.933 --> 34:01.867
Ladies really socked it in
with the food

34:01.933 --> 34:03.567
and it's gonna be a big,
hearty meal.

34:03.633 --> 34:05.000
And it's by their own hands.

34:05.333 --> 34:07.100
The girls may not have
shot the caribou

34:07.167 --> 34:08.467
but they helped work him,
and drag him,

34:08.533 --> 34:10.833
and participated in everything
but pulling the trigger.

34:11.433 --> 34:13.233
This is like food
of the season to us.

34:13.300 --> 34:15.167
This is kind of like having
turkey for Thanksgiving,

34:15.567 --> 34:17.267
or having a ham at Christmas.

34:17.333 --> 34:19.433
-Pretty good, eh?
-Pretty good.

34:19.500 --> 34:22.533
CHIP: Yep. We've got firewood,
so we've got heat.

34:22.600 --> 34:24.000
We got our tents up.

34:24.067 --> 34:25.667
We got uh, meat.

34:26.633 --> 34:29.500
Now we're secure.
We've got all the basic things
we need.

34:29.567 --> 34:31.867
The best thing is that
some day when me
and your mom aren't here,

34:31.933 --> 34:34.500
you girls know how to do
all of this, no matter what
the job is.

34:35.267 --> 34:37.800
And the best part
of that is that you get
all hands-on experience.

34:37.867 --> 34:39.367
We don't just sit there
and tell 'em what we've done,

34:39.433 --> 34:41.600
we talk about
what we've all done,
and done together.

34:41.667 --> 34:44.100
It's adventure,
it's family time,

34:44.167 --> 34:45.667
it's just, uh, being together.

34:48.633 --> 34:51.200
CHIP: We're in the right spot.
We're at this spot
for a reason.

34:51.467 --> 34:55.233
This is uh, this is home
to us.
We keep coming back here.

34:55.300 --> 34:57.100
Nothing like Kiwalik, yeah?

34:57.167 --> 34:58.467
Nothing like Kiwalik.

34:59.067 --> 35:00.833
(ALL CHUCKLING)

35:05.300 --> 35:08.833
GLENN: You have to learn
the cycles and the times
where things are happening

35:08.900 --> 35:10.833
so that you can take advantage
of the opportunities.

35:21.867 --> 35:24.733
In the spring when the lake
starts to melt, it's the time
of year when the ducks

35:24.800 --> 35:27.967
are gonna be concentrated
along the shoreline because
they got no wheres else to go.

35:28.033 --> 35:29.567
Ducks need water,
and this is where it is.

35:30.300 --> 35:31.967
Right in this moat
along the shoreline.

35:33.267 --> 35:35.233
But conditions
are changing fast.

35:35.300 --> 35:37.000
With that sun beating
down on the ice today,

35:37.500 --> 35:38.967
it'll get up in the 70s.

35:39.033 --> 35:40.433
And the lake ice
right along the edge,

35:40.500 --> 35:42.667
the moat's getting wider,
it's starting to break up.

35:42.733 --> 35:45.167
Little pieces are breaking
off when the breeze blows.

35:46.033 --> 35:47.300
It's gonna change real fast.

35:47.733 --> 35:50.567
If a breeze comes up,
this can all disappear
in one day.

35:57.433 --> 36:00.533
I see four so far.

36:00.600 --> 36:02.633
Let's see if I can get close
enough to get a shot.

36:12.633 --> 36:13.767
(SHOT FIRED)

36:21.033 --> 36:22.033
(GUN SHOT)

36:24.233 --> 36:25.700
I hit one.

36:29.767 --> 36:33.000
I shot, it took off,
and I kept shooting

36:33.067 --> 36:35.167
when they were in the air
and got one of 'em.

36:35.567 --> 36:37.267
Thankfully a breeze
blew the duck back in,

36:37.333 --> 36:40.100
but it got hung up in some
grass out here off the shore.

36:41.500 --> 36:43.900
The bottom here
is really soft and muddy,

36:43.967 --> 36:46.700
so I'm gonna make something
to throw out there
and retrieve the duck.

36:47.933 --> 36:49.933
I don't want to walk out there
and get stuck in the mud.

36:54.167 --> 36:55.667
Here we go.

36:55.867 --> 36:57.933
We'll see what happens.
It might work.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.367
I might be able
to throw it that far,

36:59.433 --> 37:00.567
I'll see. I don't know.

37:03.833 --> 37:05.633
No. Didn't make it.

37:09.300 --> 37:10.300
Give it another shot.

37:12.567 --> 37:13.567
I just missed it.

37:14.733 --> 37:17.167
Broke a few more braches off.
Lighten it up a little bit.

37:17.600 --> 37:20.233
See if I can get it out over
the duck.

37:22.333 --> 37:24.400
Yes! I'm gonna
get it this time.

37:24.500 --> 37:26.567
There it goes. Snagged it.

37:28.833 --> 37:30.400
Got my duck.

37:31.267 --> 37:32.833
Another shoveler.

37:32.900 --> 37:34.367
A male. That's what I wanted.

37:35.567 --> 37:37.600
Duck hunting's good today.

37:37.700 --> 37:39.200
Couldn't ask for a better day.

37:44.133 --> 37:45.867
Got my three ducks.

37:46.533 --> 37:48.500
Looks all right for now.

37:48.567 --> 37:49.833
(SIGHS)

37:49.900 --> 37:51.167
Cook 'em kind
of long and slow.

37:54.500 --> 37:56.500
Look at those beautiful ducks.

37:56.567 --> 37:58.500
Oh, yeah those are done.

37:58.567 --> 38:00.700
The only meat
I've had for a while has been
dried caribou meat.

38:00.767 --> 38:02.700
This is the first fresh meat
I've eaten in some time.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.033
Mm.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.933
I mean what better place
to have dinner,

38:09.000 --> 38:10.233
than right beside the lake

38:10.300 --> 38:11.933
that I walked around
to find these ducks?

38:14.433 --> 38:16.367
Mm, it was a beautiful day.

38:26.433 --> 38:28.633
SUE: Well, the world is circle
and it turns around and round.

38:28.700 --> 38:31.333
Things change,
things evolve, things rotate.

38:36.200 --> 38:38.367
The journey of getting Kavik
back up and running.

38:38.433 --> 38:43.833
I want to get the mass done
rather than all the tiny
little chores.

38:44.700 --> 38:46.733
Finished getting
all the freezers out.

38:47.200 --> 38:50.233
But now,
I've got a whole winter's
worth of garbage to burn.

38:52.967 --> 38:56.267
This is, uh, this is just
another chore on the list.

39:00.700 --> 39:04.533
I mean it's like anywhere,
you know,
sweetie baby honey do-list.

39:04.600 --> 39:06.600
Take out the garbage.

39:06.667 --> 39:09.867
Only problem is I'm my own
sweetie baby honey do.

39:09.933 --> 39:13.200
This is the Sue-do list.
The honey-Sue list.

39:14.467 --> 39:16.400
So these are the cigarettes.

39:16.467 --> 39:19.267
Um, to do the work
the doctor did,

39:19.333 --> 39:21.500
I had to quit smoking.

39:21.567 --> 39:25.033
So, and he told me the gravity
of the situation.

39:25.100 --> 39:27.567
And that it was, ah,

39:27.633 --> 39:29.533
the necessity of the surgery
was life or death.

39:29.600 --> 39:31.600
He wouldn't do it if I smoked.

39:31.667 --> 39:33.367
Put out the cigarette before
I walked into his office,

39:33.433 --> 39:34.433
haven't had one since.

39:35.600 --> 39:37.900
Come on.
I'm serious about quitting.

39:37.967 --> 39:39.600
So I'm burning
all the cigarettes that I had.

39:44.800 --> 39:46.367
Bye, cigarettes!

39:47.933 --> 39:50.033
You're gonna
have to smoke without me.

40:02.433 --> 40:03.833
Ah! Who the foxy?

40:04.733 --> 40:06.533
Who's my little foxy!

40:06.867 --> 40:08.800
Who is that? Is that Slinky?

40:08.867 --> 40:11.200
It took Slinky a day
to figure out that I was here.

40:11.700 --> 40:12.800
Come on.

40:12.867 --> 40:15.067
Slinky and Ermie
were best buddies.

40:15.667 --> 40:17.433
Um, they would,
Slinky would beak on the side

40:17.500 --> 40:18.733
of the tent every morning.

40:18.800 --> 40:20.667
And Ermie would beak back
on the window.

40:20.733 --> 40:21.833
And they would come out
and play.

40:22.567 --> 40:26.100
Because of Ermie's
health condition,
um, she's got to stay in town.

40:26.600 --> 40:28.867
And is now living
in town permanently.

40:28.933 --> 40:31.500
So, I don't have
a little friend here any more .

40:35.367 --> 40:38.800
Don't want to get emotional,
but it means
a lot to me to have the foxes.

40:39.433 --> 40:41.167
Yuck! Come on, dummy, come on.

40:42.800 --> 40:43.967
(WHISTLES) Come on.

40:44.400 --> 40:45.633
Come in.

40:48.033 --> 40:52.933
It's good to be back. I mean,
that the amount of work
I have to do is astounding.

40:53.567 --> 40:55.667
Um, I'm gonna
have to be creative.

40:55.733 --> 41:00.067
Uh, I have a 10-pound
weight restriction,
for the foreseeable future.

41:02.567 --> 41:05.333
Honestly I need to take
this entire summer,

41:07.000 --> 41:10.133
and assess how well I can do
my job.

41:10.200 --> 41:11.567
Am I done?

41:11.633 --> 41:13.967
And the answer is,
I don't know.

41:19.800 --> 41:22.767
JESSIE: When you're in Alaska,
you work until the sun
goes down.

41:28.900 --> 41:32.667
NARRATOR: After repairing
his boat and successfully
getting it to shore,

41:32.733 --> 41:34.700
Jessie must launch his vessel
into the water

41:34.767 --> 41:39.000
and test its durability
before he can begin
his summer fishing season.

41:48.033 --> 41:49.933
(EXCLAIMS) Yeah!

41:50.000 --> 41:51.367
Time to get
the summer started!

41:52.400 --> 41:54.167
Yeah, we really
got it easy, you know?

41:54.233 --> 41:57.467
These old timers,
they just figured
everything out.

41:57.533 --> 41:59.867
Poling up rivers,

41:59.933 --> 42:02.333
pulling their dogs,
boats out with dogs.

42:03.300 --> 42:05.800
When I do this kind of stuff,
it's like I'm living
in the past.

42:06.767 --> 42:08.367
I think I was born
100 years too late.

42:12.967 --> 42:15.967
I hadn't been out on the river
since the ice flowed,
you know?

42:16.033 --> 42:19.400
So, I'd been out with other
people in their boats,
but this is my boat.

42:19.467 --> 42:22.367
And now I can go take care
of my jobs,
I gotta do out here.

42:25.333 --> 42:27.867
I'm gonna start putting up
some food
for my dogs and myself.

42:27.933 --> 42:29.900
I miss that taste
of that fresh fish.

42:33.567 --> 42:36.000
I guess this is the bonus
of living right next
to the river.

42:36.067 --> 42:37.967
All my stuff's close
for getting down here.

42:38.033 --> 42:40.433
Get to take the pleasure
of doing
a lot of this stuff by hand.

42:45.333 --> 42:48.300
The motor's running.
That's a good sign.

42:48.367 --> 42:49.967
Go upriver,
see how the boat's running.

42:53.400 --> 42:54.400
Woo!

42:55.833 --> 42:58.567
Wow, it's absolutely
beautiful out here.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.767
Getting on the river
is pretty much the peak point

43:03.833 --> 43:05.433
of happiness for me
in the summer.

43:10.267 --> 43:12.300
You just feel so free
when you're out on the river.

43:12.367 --> 43:13.867
It's an indescribable feeling.

43:14.200 --> 43:15.667
Words don't really
do justice to it.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.700
Now I got a lot of work to do,
but it's all work
I want to do.

43:19.967 --> 43:22.600
If you're out here,
it's hard for it to seem
like hard work.
