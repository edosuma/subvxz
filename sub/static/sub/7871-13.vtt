00:26.713 --> 00:28.464
Dad, what are you watching?

00:28.498 --> 00:30.466
I think it's
a Terrence Malick movie.

00:30.500 --> 00:32.534
No, you're watching
<i>Baby Poindexter,</i>

00:32.569 --> 00:34.703
the most educational DVD
available

00:34.738 --> 00:36.722
at the checkout aisle
at the grocery store.

00:36.756 --> 00:39.241
Finally, a kid's show that isn't
trying to sell you something.

00:39.276 --> 00:40.543
Which reminds me,

00:40.577 --> 00:42.444
we need to order
more rectangles.

00:46.416 --> 00:48.551
Friends.

00:50.270 --> 00:51.804
Friends.

00:53.073 --> 00:55.541
Colleagues.

00:56.610 --> 00:59.078
Don't watch that DVD.

00:59.112 --> 01:01.080
I threw that away
because studies show

01:01.114 --> 01:03.315
it doesn't do any good.

01:04.417 --> 01:05.751
Look at me.

01:06.987 --> 01:08.837
Maybe instead of watching TV
with the kids,

01:08.872 --> 01:10.456
you could take them outside.

01:10.490 --> 01:11.790
What are you doing?

01:13.493 --> 01:16.979
This so-called educational
DVD may have even stunted

01:17.013 --> 01:19.031
the development of the
kids who watched it.

01:19.065 --> 01:20.349
Wait a minute.

01:20.383 --> 01:22.384
Didn't Bart and I
both watch this thing

01:22.435 --> 01:23.602
when we were little?

01:23.637 --> 01:25.437
I'm afraid so.

01:25.472 --> 01:27.139
Well, the
obvious question is,

01:27.173 --> 01:30.976
why did I turn out
so academically superior

01:31.011 --> 01:32.544
while Bart...

01:32.579 --> 01:36.365
While Bart turned out
so wonderful in his own way.

01:36.399 --> 01:38.117
That's the way people
talk about Ralph.

01:38.151 --> 01:40.886
Ralph, whose favorite color
is peanut butter.

01:40.920 --> 01:43.238
I wish I knew what happened.

02:00.006 --> 02:02.224
But now that
I know better,

02:02.258 --> 02:04.259
no DVDs for
you kids.

02:04.294 --> 02:06.729
Just educational
television.

02:06.763 --> 02:09.664
We return to
<i>Ice Road Hand-Fishing.</i>

02:09.699 --> 02:12.334
This has been our way of life
since we were pitched

02:12.369 --> 02:15.471
the idea by reality show
producers.

02:19.843 --> 02:22.578
Welcome to
<i>Thieving Bear Chopper Hunt.</i>

02:22.612 --> 02:25.314
- Okay, no TV at all.
- What?

02:25.348 --> 02:27.783
Honey, this sounds
like a noble experiment,

02:27.817 --> 02:28.917
but like Prohibition,

02:28.952 --> 02:30.936
it will end
in a hail of bullets.

02:30.970 --> 02:32.471
Fine.

02:32.505 --> 02:34.139
No TV for 24 hours.

02:34.174 --> 02:35.474
24 hours?

02:35.508 --> 02:36.942
Where'd you pull
that crazy number?

02:36.976 --> 02:39.545
We can do without
TV for a day.

02:39.579 --> 02:41.930
We're taking Maggie
to a children's book store,

02:41.965 --> 02:43.949
where she can learn
the old-fashioned way.

02:43.983 --> 02:47.803
The way children did
from 1910 to 2002.

02:53.660 --> 02:55.194
Homer, a little help?

02:55.228 --> 02:57.096
I'm on it.

03:06.806 --> 03:09.341
Hmm. Hmm.

03:11.177 --> 03:13.979
If I buy you,
why do I need all these books?

03:14.013 --> 03:16.114
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

03:16.132 --> 03:19.818
Instead of watching TV,
we can read children's books

03:19.853 --> 03:21.954
written by TV stars.

03:28.278 --> 03:30.396
Who's Milli Vanilli?

03:30.430 --> 03:33.148
I don't know, kid.
I didn't write this.

03:33.183 --> 03:34.500
No refunds.

03:34.534 --> 03:38.270
Look, Maggie,
they have a story lady.

03:38.304 --> 03:40.606
One day, Silly Sally said,

03:40.640 --> 03:43.575
"Let's have a sloppy,
gloppy supper."

03:43.610 --> 03:45.844
First, they slurped their soup.

03:45.879 --> 03:49.515
Slurp, slurp, slurp.

03:49.549 --> 03:51.550
Then they chewed their bread.

03:51.584 --> 03:54.953
Chew, chew, chew.

03:54.988 --> 03:56.221
More soup?

03:56.256 --> 03:59.758
Oh, I could slurp this soup
forever.

03:59.793 --> 04:02.077
Slurp, slurp...

04:02.112 --> 04:03.862
Sorry, folks, she
doesn't even work here.

04:06.232 --> 04:09.201
"Spot the hidden objects."

04:09.235 --> 04:13.439
Boy, you're pretty pushy
for a book I just met.

04:13.473 --> 04:14.907
Gotcha.

04:16.476 --> 04:18.644
Candy cane
in the umbrella stand:

04:18.678 --> 04:20.779
oldest trick in the book.

04:20.814 --> 04:22.414
Okay, let's see.

04:22.449 --> 04:24.650
Ah, ah.

04:24.684 --> 04:26.385
Have you seen
Lisa and Maggie?

04:26.419 --> 04:28.887
If they're not a trumpet
or a rolling pin, then no.

04:28.922 --> 04:30.289
Yip!

04:30.323 --> 04:32.458
Homie, help
me find them.

04:32.492 --> 04:35.394
Okay, now to see if I
can apply my book knowledge

04:35.428 --> 04:36.795
to the real world.

04:45.638 --> 04:46.755
Got them.

04:47.957 --> 04:50.225
Wow, no TV for 24 hours?

04:50.260 --> 04:51.927
I couldn't get
through a day without

04:51.961 --> 04:54.296
Doctors Oz, Phil and Gupta.

04:54.330 --> 04:55.798
You're right. I'm bored.

04:55.832 --> 04:57.416
Epoxy fight!

04:57.450 --> 05:00.035
What the hell is an epoxy fight?

05:01.521 --> 05:03.172
Oh.

05:03.206 --> 05:04.790
Don't worry,
I'll clean it up.

05:04.824 --> 05:06.708
Get me some whip cream
and a safety scissors.

05:08.011 --> 05:10.445
Don't worry, all I need
is a cigarette lighter

05:10.480 --> 05:11.814
and some sandpaper.

05:14.117 --> 05:16.618
All right, let's
just use a razor.

05:19.622 --> 05:21.156
Oh, my God.

05:21.191 --> 05:22.808
You look just like your dad.

05:22.842 --> 05:26.378
Let's see how far
we can take this.

05:26.412 --> 05:28.013
And finally the tie.

05:28.047 --> 05:30.199
I always wanted
to wear a necktie.

05:30.233 --> 05:31.767
Mom says they
make you more...

05:31.801 --> 05:33.502
...of a man.

05:33.536 --> 05:35.120
Now sing
the alphabet song.

05:35.154 --> 05:38.790
♪ A-B-C-D-E-F-G

05:38.825 --> 05:41.143
♪ H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O...

05:41.194 --> 05:44.863
What if we Van Houten

05:44.898 --> 05:46.632
Whoa, that's a little too tight.

05:46.666 --> 05:47.633
Oh, yeah.

05:47.667 --> 05:49.134
Nah, back
to the sweet spot.

05:49.168 --> 05:50.802
Milhouse,

05:50.837 --> 05:54.656
if people believe you're
a grown-up, we can do anything.

05:54.691 --> 05:57.626
Like we go to a
movie theater and pay full price?

05:57.660 --> 06:00.362
That would be awesome!

06:00.396 --> 06:01.880
Okay, first, tone it down.

06:01.915 --> 06:03.715
Time to teach you to be a man.

06:03.750 --> 06:06.001
What, now I'm not
pulling it off?

06:08.388 --> 06:10.722
♪ Here comes your man

06:12.175 --> 06:15.594

06:19.616 --> 06:23.518

06:24.404 --> 06:28.523

on auto-pay.

06:28.558 --> 06:29.992
Nice.

06:30.026 --> 06:31.627
Time for your
final test.

06:37.433 --> 06:38.700
Oh, great.

06:38.735 --> 06:41.336
Another invasive Skype
from Mil... Huh?

06:41.371 --> 06:43.472
Hello, Lisa. This is my daddy.

06:43.506 --> 06:45.574
I mean, um, Kirk Van Houten.

06:45.608 --> 06:47.209
May I speak
to your father, please?

06:47.243 --> 06:49.244
He's right here.

06:49.279 --> 06:51.580
Homer, Bart would like to spend
the night at our house,

06:51.614 --> 06:53.682
and he has my permission.

06:53.716 --> 06:55.717
Sure. What do I care?

06:55.752 --> 06:57.786
Not so fast!
Huh?

06:57.820 --> 07:01.123
I also want to say that
Bart is a remarkable boy,

07:01.157 --> 07:03.025
and I disapprove
of your fathering

07:03.059 --> 07:05.427
and of your
fat stomach.

07:05.461 --> 07:08.196
Oh, well, uh... sorry.

07:08.231 --> 07:11.266
Give him anything he wants--
bigger allowance, a new bike--

07:11.301 --> 07:12.701
just do it.

07:12.735 --> 07:14.036
Whatever you say, sir.

07:14.070 --> 07:16.605
Dad, why are you kowtowing
to Mr. Van Houten?

07:16.639 --> 07:20.375
Sometimes it's just so nice
to have a man take charge.

07:20.410 --> 07:24.246
And in ten years, make Lisa
go to the prom with Milhouse.

07:24.280 --> 07:26.148
Dad.

07:26.182 --> 07:28.583
own-ups have
their reasons.

07:30.119 --> 07:32.387
Now, I want you to eat
a gallon of ice cream

07:32.422 --> 07:34.222
in under two minutes.

07:34.257 --> 07:35.557
But I just did that.

07:35.591 --> 07:38.527
You now have one
minute, 55 seconds.

07:45.018 --> 07:46.935
I'm going to like
being an adult.

07:54.778 --> 07:58.347
Now you're the same height
as your dad.

07:58.381 --> 08:00.883
I can reach the poisons now,

08:00.917 --> 08:03.786
each with an inviting skull
and crossbones.

08:03.820 --> 08:07.139
Kirk, you' wearing
that shirt I bought you.

08:07.173 --> 08:08.741
I thought
you didn't like it.

08:08.775 --> 08:10.809
I love when you
buy me clothes.

08:10.844 --> 08:12.411
You know what's itchy
and what's not.

08:12.445 --> 08:14.713
Oh, Kirk Evelyn Van Houten.

08:17.217 --> 08:18.651
I wish my dad

08:18.685 --> 08:21.487
could have been here
to see my parents kiss.

08:21.521 --> 08:23.122
Now, did you get
Kirk's license?

08:23.156 --> 08:24.123
Uh-huh.

08:24.157 --> 08:25.824
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

08:25.859 --> 08:28.060
I rented a truck.

08:28.094 --> 08:30.562
I'm driving a truck.

08:30.597 --> 08:32.965
I crashed a truck.

08:32.999 --> 08:35.433
I rented another truck.

08:38.554 --> 08:42.091
Hey, Simpson, don't you have
a lame dad of your own?

08:42.125 --> 08:44.176
Uh, I-I'd give you all my money,

08:44.210 --> 08:45.995
but my wallet
is Velcroed too tight.

08:46.029 --> 08:48.480
You're the wussiest
adult I've ever seen.

08:48.515 --> 08:50.616
An adult-- he's buying it.

08:55.739 --> 08:57.339
Kirk, remember,

08:57.374 --> 08:59.608
you have the superpowers
of a middle-aged man.

09:02.796 --> 09:04.797
Hello, Mr. Kirk.

09:06.766 --> 09:09.368
I want to buy this beer,
uh, cigarettes,

09:09.402 --> 09:12.371
magazines with boobs
and three pairs of sunglasses.

09:12.405 --> 09:14.406
Polarized.

09:14.441 --> 09:17.076
I suspect you are buying
for underage bullies,

09:17.110 --> 09:19.912
but as that is 98%
of my business,

09:19.946 --> 09:21.880
I say, "Thank you, sir.
Come again."

09:21.915 --> 09:23.549
Yo, Bart.

09:23.583 --> 09:25.417
Your grown-man
friend is all right.

09:25.452 --> 09:27.219
We should start
threatening more adults.

09:27.253 --> 09:30.022
Wouldn't that make us
criminals instead of bullies?

09:30.056 --> 09:32.691
Let's beat up a philosopher
until he gives us the answer.

09:32.726 --> 09:34.793
Oh, good idea.
Yeah, I'm in.

09:34.828 --> 09:36.378
I made my mom happy

09:36.413 --> 09:38.497
and got through the
bullies without a punch.

09:38.531 --> 09:41.066
Being an adult is super easy.

09:41.101 --> 09:43.102
Hmm, hmm... hmm.

09:47.824 --> 09:49.158
You dope.

09:49.192 --> 09:51.243
It says those are
for her pleasure.

09:51.277 --> 09:53.362
Now it's time for me
to live my fantasy

09:53.396 --> 09:55.531
with mature themes.

09:55.565 --> 09:58.117
I'll go behind
that curtain a boy

09:58.151 --> 10:00.636
but come out a man.

10:02.405 --> 10:05.274
Hmm, more money for schools.

10:05.308 --> 10:07.509
That could translate
into more homework.

10:07.544 --> 10:09.178
I know this
is highly illegal,

10:09.212 --> 10:11.346
but you're not leaving
this booth till you punch yes.

10:11.381 --> 10:12.998
Don't bother
screaming for help.

10:13.032 --> 10:15.951
This is a municipal
off-cycle election.

10:15.985 --> 10:18.153
There's no one for miles.

10:24.577 --> 10:27.045
Don't forget
your sticker.

10:31.101 --> 10:32.284
Uh, hey, bartender.

10:32.318 --> 10:34.286
We'd like two milks,

10:34.320 --> 10:37.139
and then you can tell us
where babies come from.

10:37.173 --> 10:38.474
Oh, well, in my case,

10:38.508 --> 10:40.509
my mom was hit
with a voodoo curse.

10:40.543 --> 10:42.694
I gestated for five years,

10:42.729 --> 10:45.547
then I popped out
backwards and on fire.

10:45.582 --> 10:46.632
Really?

10:46.666 --> 10:48.000
Oh, yeah, keep my tail

10:48.034 --> 10:49.751
right here in this jar.

10:49.785 --> 10:51.720
Good times.

10:52.922 --> 10:55.891
Mom, I think
Maggie misses TV.

10:59.896 --> 11:01.330
You know, Mom,
I was thinking

11:01.364 --> 11:03.015
we could take
Maggie downtown.

11:03.049 --> 11:05.868
The Jazz Hole is featuring
a Dizzy Gillespie tribute band.

11:07.036 --> 11:09.438
Their trumpeter has
the puffiest cheeks.

11:09.472 --> 11:10.856
I don't think so.

11:10.890 --> 11:12.391
The U.S. Embassy
has warned people

11:12.425 --> 11:15.027
not to go to downtown
Springfield.

11:15.061 --> 11:16.528
I get it. Middle child,

11:16.563 --> 11:18.497
never do what I want.

11:18.531 --> 11:20.499
Hmm.

11:20.533 --> 11:23.469
Okay, I also know
of a puppet show.

11:28.908 --> 11:31.844
Long before
the Teutonic slaughters

11:31.878 --> 11:33.679
visited upon our people,

11:33.713 --> 11:36.181
there was the massacre
by Mstislov

11:36.216 --> 11:38.851
of Kiev in 1132.

11:39.986 --> 11:41.553
Maybe we should go.

11:41.588 --> 11:44.256
Nobody leave till
every puppet dead.

11:46.192 --> 11:47.926
Bart, you wanted
to show me something?

11:47.961 --> 11:49.194
Just one sec.
Nelson gave me

11:49.229 --> 11:50.562
some notes on a
prank I'm doing.

11:54.817 --> 11:57.619
Now, I asked you here because
I know a cool grown-up

11:57.654 --> 11:59.821
who will take you to
that club in the city.

11:59.856 --> 12:01.290
Really? Who?

12:03.159 --> 12:04.660
Hello, Lisa.

12:04.694 --> 12:06.261
Milhouse?

12:06.296 --> 12:08.730
Milhouse?
Who's Milhouse?

12:08.765 --> 12:10.666
I mean, he-he's my son.

12:10.700 --> 12:12.100
Well, Milhouse,

12:12.135 --> 12:14.286
you might get past the bouncer
at the jazz club,

12:14.320 --> 12:16.338
because they're in no
position to turn anyone away,

12:16.372 --> 12:18.507
but it doesn't matter,
'cause we can't pay

12:18.541 --> 12:21.109
for the gas and the
cover fee anyway.

12:21.144 --> 12:24.179
Au contraire,
starfish hair.

12:24.214 --> 12:26.248
The Baby Poindexter Company
is being forced to pay

12:26.282 --> 12:27.849
a settlement to any parent

12:27.884 --> 12:30.085
who had enough misguided love
to buy their videos.

12:30.119 --> 12:32.788
They're not gonna write a
check to a couple of kids.

12:32.822 --> 12:35.857
Then I will be
your guys' dad.

12:37.977 --> 12:40.362
Thanks, but lowering your voice
and standing on paint cans

12:40.396 --> 12:44.283
doesn't make you man
enough to be my dad.

12:44.317 --> 12:46.785
Marge, can I get a subscription
to <i>Highlights</i> magazine?

12:46.819 --> 12:48.353
Homer, that's for children.

12:48.388 --> 12:49.955
Where does it say that?

12:49.989 --> 12:51.690
Read the rest of the title.

12:51.724 --> 12:54.159
<i>Highlights for...</i> D'oh!

12:58.174 --> 12:58.928
Oh, dang it.

12:58.929 --> 13:00.229
I lost my other earring.

13:00.263 --> 13:01.614
Leave it to me.

13:07.771 --> 13:09.638
Earring.
Oh.

13:09.673 --> 13:11.040
Thimble from
Monopoly game.

13:11.074 --> 13:12.191
Wondered where that was.

13:12.225 --> 13:14.643
$25 casino chip.
Oh.

13:14.678 --> 13:16.111
The smallest nesting doll.

13:16.146 --> 13:17.379
Oh.

13:17.414 --> 13:19.999
Can you find anything
you like in this bed?

13:20.033 --> 13:22.201
Just my honey pie.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.803
Want to split it
while we snuggle?

13:24.838 --> 13:26.739
Mm-hmm.

13:28.441 --> 13:30.042
Now what are you doing?

13:30.076 --> 13:31.744
Licking the wrapper.

13:33.079 --> 13:34.680
There you go, one adult

13:34.714 --> 13:36.598
and two children
one-way downtown.

13:36.633 --> 13:39.201
Um, as adults,
what do we do now?

13:39.235 --> 13:40.436
Shake hands?

13:40.470 --> 13:42.905
If you like.

13:42.939 --> 13:45.507
And that's how you
do it.

13:47.143 --> 13:48.777
Now, remember,
I can't sit backwards

13:48.812 --> 13:50.079
or I get sick.

13:50.113 --> 13:52.298
Well, if I look
at your face, I get sick.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.917
Young man, apologize
to your sister.

13:54.951 --> 13:56.402
Make me, baldy.

13:56.436 --> 13:57.803
Why, you little...

14:00.357 --> 14:02.424
My adulthood!

14:06.296 --> 14:07.997
I never thought
I'd say this,

14:08.031 --> 14:11.033
but that is conduct
unbecoming of a bus station.

14:13.136 --> 14:16.138
Where'd your babies go?

14:17.674 --> 14:19.108
Your intellect-deadening DVDs

14:19.142 --> 14:21.377
turned my brother's brain
to jelly.

14:21.411 --> 14:24.246
Pretty shapes tell me
to kill everybody.

14:24.280 --> 14:29.151
Looks like you're entitled
to the full rebate of $19.95.

14:29.185 --> 14:30.586
That's all you pay

14:30.620 --> 14:32.254
for screwing up a child
for life?

14:32.288 --> 14:34.690
Kids, let me handle this.

14:34.724 --> 14:37.826
Uh, we'd like it in singles
and nickels, please.

14:37.861 --> 14:39.828
Terrific.
Just need your signature.

14:39.863 --> 14:41.363
In cursive?

14:41.398 --> 14:42.464
"X" is fine.

14:42.499 --> 14:44.366
In cursive?

14:44.401 --> 14:47.119
Oh, it's just enough
to get home.

14:47.153 --> 14:49.471
I'm hungry now.

14:49.506 --> 14:51.590
Hey, I'm walking on
paint cans all day.

14:51.624 --> 14:53.275
Give me a break.

14:53.309 --> 14:55.144
Guys, look, free breakfast

14:55.178 --> 14:57.146
if we sit through
a sales pitch.

14:57.180 --> 14:59.815
Just remember, Milhouse,
do not buy the condo.

14:59.849 --> 15:03.485
But what if we can't afford
not to buy it?

15:05.655 --> 15:08.023
Waldo, Waldo, Waldo.

15:08.058 --> 15:11.193
Homer, Bart said the kids were
going to the Van Houtens',

15:11.227 --> 15:14.129
but Luann just told me
they're supposed to be here.

15:14.164 --> 15:15.330
They've disappeared.

15:15.365 --> 15:16.932
We'll get those kids back.

15:16.966 --> 15:20.702
Because we just bought them
new shoes.

15:20.737 --> 15:22.938
Waldo, Waldo.

15:25.870 --> 15:27.704
Do you think Lisa went
to that jazz club

15:27.738 --> 15:29.172
I wouldn't take her to?

15:29.207 --> 15:31.074
How many kids
will jazz corrupt?

15:34.045 --> 15:37.714
Lap pool and fully-quipped
gym with eucalyptus towels.

15:37.748 --> 15:39.082
Now, let me give you

15:39.116 --> 15:41.751
the 14 different
apartment configurations.

15:41.786 --> 15:43.119
The hacienda,

15:43.154 --> 15:44.287
the urban oasis,

15:44.322 --> 15:45.922
castle in the sky,

15:45.957 --> 15:47.724
Connecticut sunset...

15:47.758 --> 15:49.793
Lady, my stomach's full,
and I want to go.

15:49.827 --> 15:51.628
That's how it works
in this country.

15:51.662 --> 15:53.129
If you try to leave,

15:53.164 --> 15:54.598
you'll find the doors
are locked.

15:54.632 --> 15:56.933
Well, before our dad
signs any contracts,

15:56.968 --> 15:59.252
he has a surprise for you.

15:59.287 --> 16:02.689
Oh, I hope it's
that he's single.

16:02.723 --> 16:05.025
I'm single.

16:05.059 --> 16:06.226
Though, some days,

16:06.260 --> 16:08.628
I have a girl buddy
on field trips.

16:08.663 --> 16:11.364
You're a bit of a freak.

16:11.399 --> 16:12.982
I like that.

16:15.770 --> 16:18.555
You're the adult.

16:22.026 --> 16:25.762
Kirk, don't you have
something to tell her?

16:25.796 --> 16:28.148
Just looking for
a casual hookup?

16:28.182 --> 16:30.717
Yeah, for my
Thomas the Tank Engines.

16:30.751 --> 16:33.687
Ooh, I love how I don't
exactly understand

16:33.721 --> 16:35.305
what you're saying.

16:35.339 --> 16:38.074
Homie, do you
see anything?

16:38.109 --> 16:39.976
No. I'm sorry.

16:40.011 --> 16:42.028
It's... Wait a minute.

16:49.637 --> 16:52.005
When I said you needed
a software update,

16:52.039 --> 16:53.707
it was not a criticism.

16:58.112 --> 17:00.013
We found what
we're looking for.

17:00.047 --> 17:01.481
The kids?

17:01.515 --> 17:03.316
Sure, they could
be here. Who knows?

17:05.819 --> 17:07.186
Ooh, I love how your arms

17:07.221 --> 17:09.756
are too short and
thin for your legs.

17:09.790 --> 17:11.491
Just like a crocodile.

17:11.525 --> 17:13.193
I'm feeling a strange,

17:13.227 --> 17:16.212
refreshing brew
of emotions. Oh, yeah.

17:17.248 --> 17:18.481
Milhouse?

17:18.516 --> 17:19.933
How'd you know it was me?

17:19.967 --> 17:22.618
The top of your head
has a 5:00 shadow.

17:22.653 --> 17:25.488
Your hair is growing back.

17:25.522 --> 17:27.022
Tell me your secret.

17:27.058 --> 17:28.792
He's ten years old.

17:28.826 --> 17:30.660
Oh, there's always a catch.

17:30.695 --> 17:33.063
Is anyone here
going to buy a condo?

17:33.097 --> 17:37.067
It's going to be yes,
but don't rush me.

17:37.101 --> 17:39.035
And worst of all,
you cast my vote.

17:39.070 --> 17:40.570
Who did you vote for

17:40.605 --> 17:42.656
in the nonpartisan
judicial election?

17:42.690 --> 17:43.823
Williamson.

17:43.858 --> 17:45.358
No, no, no.

17:45.393 --> 17:47.560
I'm really sorry, Dad,

17:47.595 --> 17:49.696
but I have to say,

17:49.730 --> 17:52.032
it was pretty cool
having your life.

17:52.066 --> 17:53.133
You mean that?

17:53.167 --> 17:54.534
I'd be happy to wind up

17:54.568 --> 17:56.036
just like you.

17:56.070 --> 17:57.404
I hope you remember that

17:57.438 --> 17:59.139
when I can't pay
for your college.

17:59.173 --> 18:00.640
Now, how would you
like to go

18:00.675 --> 18:02.142
to your own
parent-teacher interview

18:02.193 --> 18:03.810
while I see a movie?

18:03.844 --> 18:05.312
I'd like that.

18:05.346 --> 18:09.082
Son, promise you will never
look like me.

18:09.116 --> 18:10.250
I sure hope not.

18:10.284 --> 18:11.685
Why, you little...

18:11.719 --> 18:14.721
That's not a heart-warming
thing to end on!
