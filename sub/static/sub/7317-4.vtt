42:09.858 --> 42:11.660
AND AS FOR RULES...

42:11.660 --> 42:14.002
â™ª LOOK ME IN THE HEART,
AND I'LL BE BROKEN â™ª

42:14.002 --> 42:16.264
BETTER NOT BE
USING MY TOOTHBRUSH.

42:16.264 --> 42:18.006
I'M NOT.

42:18.006 --> 42:20.538
MAYBE THERE ARE NONE.

42:20.538 --> 42:24.843
â™ª ALWAYS THINKING YOU
WOULD BE REAL â™ª

42:24.843 --> 42:28.617
â™ª LOVE ME AND I FEEL STRONG
AND COLD â™ª

42:28.617 --> 42:30.679
MAYBE THE RULES OF INTIMACY

42:30.679 --> 42:34.583
ARE SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO
DEFINE FOR YOURSELF.

42:34.583 --> 42:37.956
â™ª BELIEVE
IF IT BREAKS THE SEAL â™ª

42:37.956 --> 42:43.662
â™ª I'M ALWAYS THINKING
YOU WOULD BE REAL â™ª

42:43.662 --> 42:45.894
â™ª WHERE DOES THE GOOD GO? â™ª

42:45.894 --> 42:48.036
â™ª WHERE DOES THE GOOD GO? â™ª

42:48.036 --> 42:49.968
â™ª WHERE DOES THE GOOD GO? â™ª
