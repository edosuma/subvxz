00:01.830 --> 00:04.162
Previously on Elementary...
HOLMES: Hector, the
security guard, is affiliated

00:04.200 --> 00:07.294
with the collective
that calls itself "Everyone."

00:07.340 --> 00:08.693
Not everyone
in the general sense.

00:08.740 --> 00:10.139
"Everyone," the proper noun.

00:10.170 --> 00:11.603
The cyber activists.

00:11.640 --> 00:12.800
(static crackles)

00:12.840 --> 00:14.432
What is happening
with my computer?

00:14.480 --> 00:16.141
They most likely
traced the phone here

00:16.180 --> 00:17.602
before the microwave
destroyed it.

00:17.650 --> 00:19.777
I thought we left
on good terms with Everyone.

00:19.820 --> 00:22.186
Well, as far as you
can be on good terms

00:22.220 --> 00:25.383
with an anonymous collective
of immature hackers, we did.

00:25.420 --> 00:27.809
WATSON:
Bella, Edward, Jacob.

00:27.860 --> 00:30.055
Are you guys researching
the Twilight books?

00:30.090 --> 00:32.320
We heard back
from our friends at Everyone.

00:32.360 --> 00:33.827
Apparently, there's some kind
of convention in town,

00:33.860 --> 00:36.795
and they want me to read
my essay out loud in the lobby.

00:36.830 --> 00:38.764
Everyone never gets tired
of embarrassing you, do they?

00:38.800 --> 00:41.598
Humiliation is the favorite
currency of the hacker.

00:42.840 --> 00:45.400
(beep)

00:45.440 --> 00:47.431
(heart monitor beeping steadily)

00:59.260 --> 01:01.319
(monitor flatlining)

01:04.590 --> 01:07.718
(loud knocking)

01:07.760 --> 01:09.296
(knocking continues)

01:09.330 --> 01:11.321
(monitor beeping steadily)

01:15.840 --> 01:17.865
Sherlock Holmes?
Do I know you?

01:17.910 --> 01:19.832
Kind of. We've talked.

01:19.880 --> 01:21.108
No, we haven't.

01:21.140 --> 01:22.869
No, not like in person.

01:22.910 --> 01:25.140
Uh, can I tell you
about it inside?

01:25.180 --> 01:28.217
I feel kind of exposed
out here.

01:30.820 --> 01:33.311
You cannot chew
gum In my home.

01:33.360 --> 01:34.452
Seriously?

01:34.490 --> 01:36.082
Do I look like I'm joking?

01:43.670 --> 01:45.820
You sick or
something?

01:45.870 --> 01:48.634
Training myself
to mimic death.

01:48.670 --> 01:51.207
That's an activity best done
uninterrupted, by the way.

01:53.680 --> 01:56.774
Okay, I don't just
go around telling people this.

01:56.810 --> 01:59.244
I'm Sucking Chest Wound.

02:00.850 --> 02:03.887
From Everyone.

02:03.920 --> 02:06.411
I'm the guy who made you go
to that Twilight convention.

02:08.590 --> 02:10.251
You seriously don't remember me?

02:10.290 --> 02:11.723
I'm sort of important.

02:12.960 --> 02:15.155
Mr. Chest Wound,

02:15.200 --> 02:17.168
what is it you want?

02:17.200 --> 02:19.760
Okay, so, I don't know
if you know this or not,

02:19.800 --> 02:22.439
but right now we're having,
like, a civil war.

02:22.470 --> 02:23.937
Everyone?

02:23.970 --> 02:27.872
Two sides fighting
for the soul of the collective.

02:27.910 --> 02:29.798
Did you just
roll your eyes?

02:29.850 --> 02:31.943
No. Carry on.

02:31.980 --> 02:35.245
On one side, you've got
a group pretty much led by me.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.180
We like Everyone the way it is.

02:37.220 --> 02:38.710
We're pranksters.
We don't have an ideology.

02:38.750 --> 02:40.615
We help the people
we want to help,

02:40.660 --> 02:43.424
hurt the people
we want to hurt, on, like,

02:43.460 --> 02:44.882
a case-by-case basis.

02:44.930 --> 02:47.296
The other side
follows this guy "Species."

02:47.330 --> 02:49.969
They want us to become a
straight-up political movement.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.230
_That means
establishing parameters,

02:52.270 --> 02:54.761
aligning with the left,
going against the right.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.507
And you see my role in this
as what exactly?

02:59.680 --> 03:03.241
I'm trying to get dox
on Species, you know?

03:03.280 --> 03:05.646
Dig into him,
find out who he really is.

03:05.680 --> 03:08.808
IfI can learn that, I can
find stuff to embarrass him.

03:08.850 --> 03:10.317
My side wins.

03:10.350 --> 03:12.489
I haven't had
any luck yet.

03:12.520 --> 03:14.715
You're, you know, a detective.

03:14.760 --> 03:16.819
(door opens)
WATSON:
Hey, I'll be back in a bit.

03:16.860 --> 03:19.328
Uh, j-just-just one
moment, if you please.

03:19.360 --> 03:21.726
Mr. Chest Wound,
I'm afraid I can't help you.

03:21.760 --> 03:23.318
I can pay.
No.

03:23.370 --> 03:25.326
That's not the issue.

03:25.370 --> 03:26.997
The internecine struggles
of a group

03:27.040 --> 03:28.996
of emotionally-stunted
self-styled activists

03:29.040 --> 03:30.769
interests me not one iota.

03:32.710 --> 03:34.007
HOLMES:
So, in my haste

03:34.040 --> 03:36.270
to get away
from Sucking Chest Wound,

03:36.310 --> 03:38.505
I neglected to ask you
what I'm helping you with.

03:38.550 --> 03:40.711
Well, you know Connie, right?
She's our neighbor.

03:40.750 --> 03:42.012
She lives two doors down.

03:42.050 --> 03:44.883
Her daughter Emmanuelle
is getting bullied online.

03:44.920 --> 03:47.559
She asked
ifI could look into it.

03:47.590 --> 03:50.252
You've determined that
the offending messages

03:50.290 --> 03:51.985
are coming from those
computers, and you're here

03:52.030 --> 03:54.555
to confront the sender?
Close.

03:54.600 --> 03:57.398
I'm not sure how much
confronting there's gomg to be.

03:58.930 --> 04:01.535
These are the messages
from the bully,

04:01.570 --> 04:04.403
and these are Emmanuelle's
public posts.

04:07.980 --> 04:11.006
Oh, the patterns of
speech, the misspelling.

04:11.050 --> 04:12.711
These are written
by the same person.

04:12.750 --> 04:14.968
She's sending the
messages to herself.

04:15.020 --> 04:17.614
If I'm right,
I don't want to tattle on her.

04:17.650 --> 04:19.515
She wants attention
from her parents,

04:19.560 --> 04:22.882
but she has to get it without
driving them crazy with worry.

04:28.500 --> 04:29.922
(sighs softly)

04:33.370 --> 04:35.497
How are you?

04:35.540 --> 04:37.064
How am I?

04:37.110 --> 04:39.704
Well, I-I thought
perhaps that, uh,

04:39.740 --> 04:42.038
silence was awkward,
so I was attempting to fill it.

04:42.080 --> 04:43.843
(chuckles)

04:43.880 --> 04:46.075
(whispering): You get that
we're in a library, right?

04:46.110 --> 04:47.475
No, I see other people talking.

04:47.520 --> 04:49.988
Typically,
you're the one

04:50.020 --> 04:53.478
who lubricates these moments
wrth conversation, so...

04:53.520 --> 04:55.579
Well, I'm good if you are.

05:05.930 --> 05:07.898
(footsteps approaching)

05:07.940 --> 05:10.568
You know you've been down here
for five hours?
Have I?

05:10.610 --> 05:12.578
They have a good collection
of books on metallurgy.

05:12.610 --> 05:13.838
Well, you might want
to check some of them out.

05:13.880 --> 05:16.348
We're almost through here.

05:16.380 --> 05:18.371
HOLMES:
That's the neighbor's daughter.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.474
Your theory was correct.

05:21.520 --> 05:24.080
I'm gonna go talk to her. I'll
come find you when I'm done.

05:26.090 --> 05:28.957
(cell phone ringing)

05:28.990 --> 05:30.855
Detective.

05:30.890 --> 05:33.950
BELL: Hey. I'm at the scene
of a murder, and it looks like

05:34.000 --> 05:36.764
you might have some kind
of connection to the victim.

05:36.800 --> 05:38.097
Sorry?

05:38.130 --> 05:39.666
Well, this guy's computer--

05:39.700 --> 05:43.409
his wallpaper's a picture of you
wearing a dress?

05:45.670 --> 05:49.128
Victim's name is Erroll White.

05:49.180 --> 05:51.808
No sign of forced entry,
so maybe he let his killer in.

05:51.850 --> 05:53.818
As far as the
murder weapon goes,

05:53.850 --> 05:56.011
I'm thinking it was
a little samurai sword.

05:56.050 --> 05:58.985
Well, those stab wounds
are deep.

05:59.020 --> 06:01.511
And those displays always have
two swords on them, right?

06:01.560 --> 06:02.857
Big one and a little one.

06:02.890 --> 06:05.381
The wakizashi is missing.

06:05.430 --> 06:07.091
Well observed.

06:07.130 --> 06:10.099
Obviously, this guy spent a lot
of time in front of computers,

06:10.130 --> 06:12.462
so our tech guy has
been digging around.

06:12.500 --> 06:14.695
I guess he posts
to a lot of Web sites

06:14.740 --> 06:16.799
using the name "Species"?

06:18.210 --> 06:20.701
You've heard of him.

06:20.740 --> 06:24.779
He's a member of the hacker
collective Everyone.

06:24.810 --> 06:27.574
They occasionally force me
to humiliate myself

06:27.620 --> 06:29.417
in exchange for information.

06:29.450 --> 06:31.816
Hence, the wallpaper you saw.

06:49.940 --> 06:52.534
You find something?

07:03.090 --> 07:04.489
We have a suspect.

07:04.520 --> 07:06.886
I can give you a description.

07:06.920 --> 07:08.751
I could also give you a name,

07:08.790 --> 07:10.985
after a fashion.

07:11.030 --> 07:12.759
The young man that we seek

07:12.800 --> 07:15.689
calls himself
Sucking Chest Wound.

07:39.990 --> 07:41.981
(video winding,
footsteps approaching)

07:46.960 --> 07:49.758
(sighs) Hey. Thought this
place was camera-free now.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.791
Inside, not out.

07:51.830 --> 07:53.969
I'm looking for footage
of Sucking Chest Wound

07:54.000 --> 07:56.969
that I can send to the police.

07:57.010 --> 08:00.207
Well, you could send
it to Mason, right?

08:00.240 --> 08:03.971
I mean, he's got that
facial-recognition software.

08:04.010 --> 08:06.945
Mason is currently grounded
from the Internet.

08:06.980 --> 08:08.743
So, why would
this guy come here,

08:08.780 --> 08:10.111
ask you to find someone
named Species,

08:10.150 --> 08:12.289
and then murder him
at the end of the day?

08:12.320 --> 08:14.185
Perhaps it wasn't
a planned killing.

08:14.220 --> 08:16.279
Perhaps he doesn't really
want to hire me.

08:16.320 --> 08:18.550
He just wanted someone
affiliated with the police

08:18.590 --> 08:20.751
to think that he didn't know
who Species was.

08:22.330 --> 08:25.697
Why are those guys bringing
a python into the house?

08:25.730 --> 08:27.129
It's gone now.

08:27.170 --> 08:29.161
(phone chimes)

08:31.770 --> 08:33.135
Problem?

08:33.180 --> 08:34.807
No, it's nothing.

08:34.840 --> 08:36.842
It's just my friend Marnie
from medical school.

08:36.880 --> 08:40.179
She's getting married, and
even though none of us are 22,

08:40.220 --> 08:42.040
she's having a
bachelorette party.

08:42.080 --> 08:44.844
She says it's just an excuse
for us to get together,

08:44.890 --> 08:46.619
so we're gonna meet
tomorrow and plan.

08:46.660 --> 08:47.854
(phone chimes)

08:47.890 --> 08:49.949
It involves a
lot of texts.

08:49.990 --> 08:52.595
Sounds like you'd rather
do anything else.

08:52.630 --> 08:53.858
No. She's a friend.

08:53.900 --> 08:56.255
It'll be good
to see her.

08:56.300 --> 08:58.768
I'll get in the
spirit eventually.

09:01.770 --> 09:05.137
Oh. Is that him?

09:07.710 --> 09:09.575
What are you looking for now?

09:18.690 --> 09:20.009
That.

09:23.730 --> 09:26.619
So you want to ID.
him through his gum.

09:26.660 --> 09:28.890
Don't you already
have a DNA sample?

09:28.930 --> 09:32.297
The hair I found
yielded no matches in CODIS,

09:32.330 --> 09:35.788
but if we can match it
to the gum, then we'll be able

09:35.840 --> 09:37.000
to confirm that both

09:37.040 --> 09:39.873
came from Sucking Chest Wound.

09:42.410 --> 09:45.846
"Boys In the Woods."
"Cable TV." What are these?

09:45.880 --> 09:47.370
Look at the last phrase.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.842
"Encore-- IOU."

09:48.880 --> 09:51.747
They're names of songs.
It's a set list.

09:51.790 --> 09:52.984
Oh, so what are
these in the margins?

09:53.020 --> 09:54.908
Not a clue.

09:54.960 --> 09:57.383
But we may have more than
a second DNA sample here.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.853
If we can attribute
these songs to a musrcnan,

09:59.900 --> 10:01.891
we might be able
to identify our man

10:01.930 --> 10:04.296
by means other than genetic.

10:04.330 --> 10:06.935
*

10:13.040 --> 10:15.201
Hey. What are you
doing down here?

10:17.210 --> 10:19.872
(turns music down)

10:22.990 --> 10:24.946
But how can you tell

10:24.990 --> 10:26.309
if Clyde likes
it or not?

10:26.350 --> 10:28.318
It's really obvious
if you know what to look for.

10:28.360 --> 10:31.022
This particular song is
by a group called Fol Chen.

10:31.060 --> 10:34.689
And its title is "I.O.U."

10:34.730 --> 10:36.698
Oh, that's the encore
on the set list

10:36.730 --> 10:38.197
that Sucking Chest
Wound threw away.

10:38.230 --> 10:41.734
After you went to bed last
night, I realized that the notes

10:41.770 --> 10:44.898
on this paper refer to
volume knobs on a sound board.

10:44.940 --> 10:47.238
The one song--
the bass needs to be louder.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.975
For another, it's the drums.

10:49.010 --> 10:51.945
Sucking Chest Wound
works as a sound engineer.

10:51.980 --> 10:54.039
So, if we can
find a club

10:54.080 --> 10:56.014
where Fol Chen played
this set recently,

10:56.050 --> 10:58.041
we can figure out
where he works.

10:58.090 --> 10:59.887
These songs were played
in this order

10:59.920 --> 11:02.252
at a club in Williamsburg
three days ago.

11:02.290 --> 11:06.795
The proprietor gave me the name
of their sound engineer.

11:06.830 --> 11:09.355
Petros Franken.

11:09.400 --> 11:12.062
Sucking Chest Wound.

11:12.100 --> 11:14.739
(phone chimes)
I gave his name
to Detective Bell, and...

11:14.770 --> 11:18.365
Mr. Franken has just been
taken in for questioning.

11:18.410 --> 11:20.469
I didn't kill Species!
Of course I didn't.

11:20.510 --> 11:23.047
I didn't even know who he was
until you guys arrested me.

11:23.080 --> 11:25.469
Works out pretty well for you
if we believe that.

11:25.510 --> 11:27.068
Come on, Petros.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.872
He had your hair on his clothes.

11:28.920 --> 11:31.047
I told you.
I never even met him.

11:31.090 --> 11:32.887
You sent him death threats.

11:34.990 --> 11:37.982
"I wish I could put cancer
and Ebola into a cannon

11:38.030 --> 11:40.191
and shoot them at you
and your whole family."

11:40.230 --> 11:41.492
That's just how we talk.

11:41.530 --> 11:42.997
I got 40 more pages
of this stuff.

11:43.030 --> 11:44.395
(phone chimes)

11:44.430 --> 11:47.934
Quote: "I will
disembowel you

11:47.970 --> 11:49.904
and your entire life.
D.I.A.F."

11:49.940 --> 11:52.101
Your friendships continue
to present a nuisance?

11:52.140 --> 11:54.108
Turns out,
an ironic bachelorette party

11:54.140 --> 11:56.176
requires just as much
back-and-forth as a real one.

11:56.210 --> 11:58.405
I'm just gonna turn it
on silent.

11:58.450 --> 12:00.771
BELL: We're going through
all your stuff right now.

12:00.820 --> 12:03.209
If we find anything else
that ties you to the murder,

12:03.250 --> 12:05.047
you lose your window
to cooperate.

12:05.090 --> 12:07.012
How can I cooperate?
I didn't do it!

12:08.260 --> 12:11.058
(sighs)

12:11.090 --> 12:13.422
When did Species die? Exactly.

12:13.460 --> 12:15.257
The M.E. puts the time of death

12:15.300 --> 12:18.098
between 7:00 and 8:30
last night.

12:18.130 --> 12:19.290
Oh, thank God.

12:19.330 --> 12:21.935
I was with Mockingbird.

12:21.970 --> 12:23.858
She left my place
at, like, 7:30.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.138
BELL:
Let me guess.

12:25.170 --> 12:26.159
She's in Everyone, too?

12:26.210 --> 12:27.404
PETROS:
Her real name

12:27.440 --> 12:28.839
is Rachel Carter.

12:28.880 --> 12:30.074
She hangs around
the chat boards.

12:30.110 --> 12:31.998
I'm... a big deal in the group.

12:32.050 --> 12:33.779
I think
she was impressed by that.

12:33.820 --> 12:36.471
We traded private messages,
started flirting.

12:36.520 --> 12:38.488
She came over for a while
last nIght.

12:38.520 --> 12:41.489
Mm, we were...

12:41.520 --> 12:43.522
You know?

12:43.560 --> 12:46.529
You can say "having sex."
We're both adults.

12:46.560 --> 12:49.199
She works on Wall Street.

12:49.230 --> 12:51.926
Go see her. She'll tell you.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.896
RACHEL:
Ew.

12:55.940 --> 12:58.329
No, I'm not
sleeping with Petros.

12:58.370 --> 12:59.906
Come on. (scoffs)

12:59.940 --> 13:02.033
So he wasn't with you
last night?

13:05.250 --> 13:07.411
Look, he's a funny guy.

13:07.450 --> 13:10.817
We've exchanged a few messages--
some of them were even flirty.

13:10.850 --> 13:13.284
Maybe he thought I'd say we were
together because of that.

13:13.320 --> 13:14.810
Ms. Carter,
you're an investment banker,

13:14.860 --> 13:16.054
and yet you're a member
of Everyone.

13:16.090 --> 13:17.421
I'm not a member.

13:17.460 --> 13:19.928
I go to the boards
where they hang out sometimes.

13:19.960 --> 13:22.121
It's fun. You get
to be somebody else for a while.

13:22.160 --> 13:24.526
Surely your employers would
take issue with your affiliation

13:24.570 --> 13:26.367
to an activist group
which sometimes espouses

13:26.400 --> 13:28.197
an anticapitalist agenda.

13:28.240 --> 13:31.061
What's your point?
Do you think that I'm lying?

13:31.110 --> 13:32.600
Well, in my experience,
investment bankers

13:32.640 --> 13:34.232
are very good
at concealing untruths.
(phone chimes)

13:34.280 --> 13:37.249
You already know
that I post to the boards.

13:37.280 --> 13:39.248
You can tell my boss
if you want.

13:39.280 --> 13:42.078
If I was with Petros,
why not just admit it?

13:42.120 --> 13:44.088
CSU just finished processing

13:44.120 --> 13:45.314
Petros Franken's car.

13:45.350 --> 13:47.011
They found some
blood in the trunk.

13:47.060 --> 13:49.085
Looks like it's a
match for the victim.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.951
Can I go?

13:54.960 --> 13:57.019
So I guess that's that.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.935
You did. And she showed up
with no pants on. I remember.

14:01.970 --> 14:04.564
Okay, wait, Marnie,
on a scale of one to ten,

14:04.610 --> 14:06.362
how dumb are we gonna get
with this?

14:06.410 --> 14:08.901
Oh. Um, what's ten?

14:08.940 --> 14:11.340
I don't even know. I feel
like the scale's probably moved

14:11.380 --> 14:13.211
since the last time
I did this.

14:13.250 --> 14:14.649
Okay, let's say strippers?

14:15.350 --> 14:16.271
No.

14:16.320 --> 14:17.287
Okay.

14:17.320 --> 14:18.184
Well, what's five?

14:18.220 --> 14:19.187
Five would be, like,

14:19.220 --> 14:20.187
a nice dinner.

14:20.220 --> 14:21.209
A couple extra drinks.

14:22.220 --> 14:23.949
Five sounds about right.
(chuckles)

14:24.630 --> 14:25.654
Okay, but we have to

14:25.690 --> 14:27.089
embarrass Marnie
at least once.

14:27.130 --> 14:28.392
(phone chimes,
chatter continues)

14:28.430 --> 14:31.024
You have it coming.
MARNIE: Girls. Mm.

14:31.070 --> 14:33.231
Everything okay?

14:33.270 --> 14:35.431
Uh, yeah. Ijust got a text
from Sherlock.

14:35.470 --> 14:38.598
He just found a suspect
in this case we're working.

14:38.640 --> 14:40.904
Kind of can't let this go.
Mm.

14:42.010 --> 14:43.500
No problem.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.199
I'm so sorry.

14:45.250 --> 14:45.909
Bummer.

14:45.950 --> 14:47.212
I'll call you guys later, okay?

14:47.250 --> 14:48.911
Okay, good luck.
Have fun.

14:48.950 --> 14:50.383
Bye.

14:50.420 --> 14:51.944
(door closes)

14:51.990 --> 14:54.185
You're home earlier
than I expected.

14:54.220 --> 14:55.414
Yeah. I ducked out.

14:55.460 --> 14:57.018
I wasn't really
in the spirit.

14:57.060 --> 14:58.254
What are you doing?

14:58.290 --> 15:00.190
Just awaiting a visitor.

15:00.230 --> 15:03.028
(knocking)

15:10.010 --> 15:11.602
Ms. Carter.

15:11.640 --> 15:13.631
Please come in.

15:20.680 --> 15:23.387
I wasn't entirely satisfied

15:23.420 --> 15:24.978
with Ms. Carter's
flat denial

15:25.020 --> 15:26.647
of Petros Franken's alibi.

15:26.690 --> 15:28.658
Didn't make any sense.

15:28.690 --> 15:31.523
Why was he so genuinely
relieved to send us

15:31.560 --> 15:33.289
to talk to her?

15:33.330 --> 15:36.128
A bit of digging revealed
that Ms. Carter only goes

15:36.160 --> 15:38.560
by the name Rachel Carter
in her professional life.

15:38.600 --> 15:43.208
In her private life, she goes
by the name Rachel Eddings.

15:43.240 --> 15:45.265
Her married name.

15:46.710 --> 15:49.406
WATSON: You denied you were
with Petros not to save face

15:49.440 --> 15:52.409
with your employers but
to save face from your husband.

15:52.450 --> 15:55.248
Telling the truth meant you had
to admit to having an affair...

15:55.280 --> 15:57.510
Stop.

15:59.590 --> 16:02.058
I was going
to tell you people anyway.

16:02.090 --> 16:04.684
I lied because I was panicked.

16:04.730 --> 16:08.120
But I can't let
Petros rot In prison.

16:08.160 --> 16:10.128
I was at his apartment
that night.

16:10.170 --> 16:12.229
I left around 7:30.

16:12.270 --> 16:14.067
So he's innocent.

16:14.100 --> 16:15.738
He didn't commit the murder.

16:15.770 --> 16:19.433
I'm inclined to agree
with you, Watson.

16:19.470 --> 16:22.075
Petros was framed.

16:32.150 --> 16:33.481
I told you I didn't do it.

16:33.520 --> 16:35.681
When can I get out of here?
Unfortunately,

16:35.720 --> 16:37.722
Mockingbird's recantation
of her earlier lie

16:37.760 --> 16:41.150
is not enough to overcome the
physical evidence against you.

16:41.200 --> 16:45.068
In order to secure your release,
we must prove your innocence.

16:45.100 --> 16:48.467
Better still, prove
someone else's guilt. So...

16:48.500 --> 16:51.731
who had motive and opportunity
to kill Species and frame you?

16:51.770 --> 16:54.375
You got to understand,

16:54.410 --> 16:57.174
I've helped hack some
pretty dangerous people.

16:57.210 --> 16:59.542
Uh, the CIA, the KKK.

16:59.580 --> 17:01.514
Hell, we went after ISIS.

17:01.550 --> 17:03.586
If those groups wanted you dead,
then you would be dead.

17:03.620 --> 17:05.247
But you are alive.

17:05.290 --> 17:07.178
Erroll "Species" White
is the one lying

17:07.220 --> 17:08.812
in a refrigerated drawer.

17:08.860 --> 17:11.420
He was the target.
You're a patsy.

17:11.460 --> 17:14.054
A patsy?
You're a well-known
philosophical rival of Species.

17:14.100 --> 17:17.797
The question is not
who wants to hurt you,

17:17.830 --> 17:20.367
but rather who had motive
to kill him.

17:20.400 --> 17:22.459
You know, there are several
principal lines of inquiry

17:22.500 --> 17:25.207
when it comes to determining
the motive for a murder.

17:25.240 --> 17:28.107
There's cherchez la femme--
look to the woman.

17:28.140 --> 17:30.108
Do you remember
him posting anything

17:30.150 --> 17:31.777
about any toxic
romantic entanglements?

17:31.810 --> 17:35.109
Rule 57 of the Internet:
you Will never have sex.

17:35.150 --> 17:38.142
(chuckles)
I'm the exception.

17:38.190 --> 17:39.839
Pretty sure Species
wasn't getting any.

17:39.890 --> 17:42.154
Like, ever.

17:42.190 --> 17:44.158
Another line of inquiry
is cui bono.

17:44.190 --> 17:47.455
Who benefits, hmm?
A.K.A. follow the money.

17:47.500 --> 17:50.094
Could anyone profit
from Species' death,

17:50.130 --> 17:51.825
financially or otherwise?

17:52.870 --> 17:55.737
Species' Stash.

17:55.770 --> 17:58.159
It's something he mentioned
in Inner Sanctum.

17:58.210 --> 18:01.839
That's a chat room for, like,
Everyone's top people.

18:01.880 --> 18:05.099
Serious hackers, people who
control big-time botnets.

18:05.150 --> 18:07.243
We act as, like, a steering
committee for Everyone.

18:07.280 --> 18:09.840
Species' Stash?
He said that he
had this stash

18:09.880 --> 18:12.246
of data he'd snagged over the
years just to prove he could,

18:12.290 --> 18:14.258
stuff that would
blow our minds.

18:14.290 --> 18:16.258
He said he had millions
of credit card numbers,

18:16.290 --> 18:18.485
complete with
passwords and Socials.

18:18.530 --> 18:20.691
On the Dark Web, those
numbers would sell

18:20.730 --> 18:22.755
for eight figures, easy.

18:22.800 --> 18:24.495
That's motive, right?

18:24.530 --> 18:26.498
Follow the money.

18:26.530 --> 18:28.737
JOAN: (sighs)
Is that a rainbow

18:28.770 --> 18:30.237
coming out of that
unicorn's butt?

18:30.270 --> 18:31.908
Yeah.

18:31.940 --> 18:35.205
That is the online profile
picture of Pony Pyew Pyew,

18:35.240 --> 18:37.208
member of
Everyone's Inner Sanctum

18:37.250 --> 18:38.569
and one of the finest hackers

18:38.610 --> 18:40.874
in the world. He is also,
according to my analysis

18:40.920 --> 18:42.615
of his online profile,

18:42.650 --> 18:44.379
a resident of Goinia, Brazil,

18:44.420 --> 18:47.514
who has never traveled more than
50 miles from his home.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.209
So not our killer.

18:49.260 --> 18:50.284
I've also ruled out Twithead,

18:50.330 --> 18:52.548
Adramelech and Coldcomfort,

18:52.590 --> 18:55.297
none of whom has ever set foot
in New York.

18:55.330 --> 18:57.298
Droopsnout suffers
from Duchenne muscular dystrophy

18:57.330 --> 18:59.890
and is incapable of having
stabbed Erroll White to death.

18:59.930 --> 19:02.535
What about Killspree?

19:02.570 --> 19:05.607
Uniquely, he doesn't keep
his identity a secret.

19:05.640 --> 19:07.904
Maynard Lim lives
in Kuala Lumpur and is

19:07.940 --> 19:10.170
the billionaire creator
of a popular phone game

19:10.210 --> 19:12.201
called Flutter Crow.

19:12.250 --> 19:14.878
To him, a collection of credit
card numbers would mean nothing.

19:14.920 --> 19:16.717
Which leaves us

19:16.750 --> 19:21.312
with eight unidentified members
of Everyone's Inner Sanctum.

19:21.360 --> 19:24.181
All of whom are proving
extremely difficult to unmask.

19:24.230 --> 19:26.357
What's up
with Munkey Versus Shark?

19:26.390 --> 19:28.790
Munkey Versus Shark,
I suspect, has ADHD.

19:28.830 --> 19:30.866
He changes his profile picture
constantly,

19:30.900 --> 19:33.562
sometimes up
to three times a day.

19:34.540 --> 19:35.962
Look at this last one.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.729
Some kind of motorcycle.

19:37.770 --> 19:40.739
That's a Ducati
1199 Superleggera.

19:40.780 --> 19:43.248
And he's put the word
"mine" on top of it.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.271
Well, could be
a kid's fantasy.

19:45.310 --> 19:46.902
Or maybe someone made
a lot of money

19:46.950 --> 19:48.747
and bought themselves a
treat. I'll call Marcus,

19:48.780 --> 19:50.645
see if he can track down
recent purchases

19:50.690 --> 19:52.942
of limited edition
Italian motorcycles.

19:55.690 --> 19:58.557
Caleb Hill? NYPD.

19:58.590 --> 20:00.649
You guys here about the guy
who cut me off?

20:00.700 --> 20:01.997
'Cause I'm totally gonna sue.

20:02.030 --> 20:03.998
You drove your
brand-new Ducati

20:04.030 --> 20:05.827
through a red light at
triple the speed limit.

20:05.870 --> 20:08.236
The guy whose truck
you broadsided

20:08.270 --> 20:09.669
is more likely
to sue you.

20:09.700 --> 20:11.258
It's a good thing you
just made all that cash

20:11.310 --> 20:13.301
off of Species' Stash.

20:15.310 --> 20:17.244
I don't know
what you're talking about.

20:17.280 --> 20:18.679
BELL: Come on.
That bike,

20:18.710 --> 20:19.938
top-end computer,

20:19.980 --> 20:21.709
new smartphone,
flat screen TV.

20:21.750 --> 20:23.945
Been spending a lot of money
the last few days

20:23.990 --> 20:26.311
for an unemployed
computer science student.

20:26.350 --> 20:27.510
And all from selling

20:27.560 --> 20:29.016
only a fraction of the Stash.

20:29.060 --> 20:31.028
And before you lodge
any further protests,

20:31.060 --> 20:33.858
you're currently chatting
on Everyone's Inner Sanctum.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.289
Which only confirms what the
NYPD's Computer Crimes Division

20:36.330 --> 20:37.524
already uncovered.

20:37.570 --> 20:38.969
BELL: You're the
hacker known as

20:39.000 --> 20:40.763
Munkey Versus Shark,
you're in possession of

20:40.800 --> 20:42.631
credit card numbers
illegally obtained by

20:42.670 --> 20:44.968
Erroll "Species" White,
and you're in the process of

20:45.010 --> 20:47.831
auctioning them off
on Dark Web Internet sites.

20:49.740 --> 20:51.378
I want a lawyer.

20:51.410 --> 20:54.447
That's a good idea.
Murder is a serious charge.

20:54.480 --> 20:56.971
Hey, I didn't kill Species.
That was the CIA or whatever.

20:57.020 --> 20:59.989
Play it how you want,
but this can go two ways.

21:00.020 --> 21:02.909
You tell us your story, maybe
you get off light for the theft

21:02.960 --> 21:06.623
and the credit card sales; or
we go at you for White's death,

21:06.660 --> 21:09.629
and you get to trade this
private room for a shared cell.

21:09.660 --> 21:13.790
Now, that's a pretty nasty
tib-fib fracture you've got.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.728
Looks like they did
a double fasciotomy.

21:15.770 --> 21:17.362
You know, non-union fractures

21:17.410 --> 21:19.002
are common with
that type of injury.

21:19.040 --> 21:21.577
You're gonna have to be
very careful with your rehab.

21:21.610 --> 21:23.669
It's tough to do that
at Rikers Island.

21:26.580 --> 21:28.969
Look, it wasn't that big a deal.

21:29.020 --> 21:31.887
After Species spilled about
his Stash, I got dox on him.

21:31.920 --> 21:33.808
I found out his real name,
where he lived,

21:33.860 --> 21:35.657
and I went by,
I scoped the place out.

21:35.690 --> 21:37.055
The security in his building
was crap,

21:37.090 --> 21:39.081
so I waited for him
to go to work and then...

21:39.130 --> 21:41.018
You broke and entered?
How old-fashioned.

21:41.060 --> 21:43.028
I learned how to pick locks
on YouTube.

21:43.060 --> 21:44.391
Hmm.

21:44.430 --> 21:45.863
I got in, took his laptop,

21:45.900 --> 21:47.492
every memory stick I could find,
and got out.

21:47.540 --> 21:49.098
But that was three weeks ago.

21:49.140 --> 21:50.732
In all that time,
Species never came after me.

21:50.770 --> 21:51.998
He had no idea
who ripped him off.

21:52.040 --> 21:54.577
Look, I got
what I wanted.

21:54.610 --> 21:56.498
I had no reason to go back
and kill the guy.

21:56.540 --> 21:57.700
Let's say that we believe you.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.103
Who did it?

21:59.150 --> 22:01.015
Surely you and the rest
of the Inner Sanctum

22:01.050 --> 22:04.019
must have a theory--
beyond the CIA.

22:04.050 --> 22:07.087
Nobody knows anything solid.

22:07.120 --> 22:09.987
Well, except maybe Species.

22:10.020 --> 22:11.578
Explain that.

22:11.630 --> 22:13.655
Species' Stash
wasn't just credit card numbers.

22:13.700 --> 22:16.396
He had records
of every hack he'd ever done.

22:16.430 --> 22:17.863
_A list of flaws
In government

22:17.900 --> 22:19.788
and corporate Web sites,
and chat logs

22:19.830 --> 22:22.094
of every online conversation
he ever had.

22:22.140 --> 22:24.529
Even the ones
from Inner Sanctum.

22:26.140 --> 22:28.131
Cut me loose...

22:28.180 --> 22:30.478
I'll hand over the entire thing.

22:32.180 --> 22:35.411
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

22:39.050 --> 22:40.711
Behold.

22:40.760 --> 22:42.955
Species' Stash.

22:42.990 --> 22:45.788
I was expecting a thumb drive
or an e-mail link.

22:45.830 --> 22:48.458
Well, our tech guys say
the Stash included

22:48.500 --> 22:51.128
some pretty nasty computer
viruses and hacking tools.

22:51.170 --> 22:53.161
The FBI and the NSA
aren't excited

22:53.200 --> 22:55.566
about letting them out
into the wild.

22:55.600 --> 22:57.033
Paper distribution
is standard policy

22:57.070 --> 22:58.560
for this sort of evidence.

22:58.610 --> 23:00.430
Enjoy.

23:01.540 --> 23:03.770
(sighs)

23:06.610 --> 23:09.113
There must be thousands
of pages here.

23:09.150 --> 23:11.744
26 boxes, approximately
4,000 sheets a box--

23:11.790 --> 23:13.417
that's roughly 104,000 sheets.

23:13.460 --> 23:14.950
The search will be

23:14.990 --> 23:17.720
exceedingly tedious;
but one must, from time to time,

23:17.760 --> 23:20.627
outwork criminals
as well as outthInk them.

23:22.460 --> 23:25.463
(sighs): All right,
we may as well get started.

23:26.800 --> 23:28.438
Aren't you supposed
to be dining

23:28.470 --> 23:29.789
with your bachelorette
planning committee tonight?

23:29.840 --> 23:31.831
No, I told them
I was busy.

23:33.240 --> 23:36.676
Yo_ur behavior has been
troubIIngly Incongruous of late.

23:36.710 --> 23:37.972
Has it?

23:38.010 --> 23:39.147
You avoided
conversatIon

23:39.180 --> 23:40.909
at the library the other day.

23:40.950 --> 23:43.009
And now you've come up
with a feeble excuse

23:43.050 --> 23:44.642
to extricate yourself
from a potentially enjoyable

23:44.690 --> 23:45.748
social engagement.

23:45.790 --> 23:47.143
We have work to do.

23:47.190 --> 23:49.158
Your rede_dica_tion
to the detectIve IIfestyle

23:49.190 --> 23:51.124
has been admirable.

23:51.160 --> 23:53.754
But on more than one occasion,
I have been forced

23:53.800 --> 23:55.495
to initiate conversation
WIth you.

23:55.530 --> 23:59.022
You've been unsympathetic
to witness and suspect alike.

23:59.070 --> 24:01.197
And now you are withdrawing
from longtime friendships

24:01.240 --> 24:05.006
because they are inconvenient
to your mood.

24:05.040 --> 24:06.701
That doesn't work for me.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.202
That doesn't work for you?

24:09.240 --> 24:11.549
Our relationship is predicated

24:11.580 --> 24:14.617
on one Holmes and one Watson.

24:14.650 --> 24:16.618
It's a delicate homeostasis,

24:16.650 --> 24:19.039
and it doesn't function properly
if there are

24:19.090 --> 24:21.513
two Holmeses
and no Watsons.

24:21.560 --> 24:24.120
So while I am sensitive that
this is likely a ripple effect

24:24.160 --> 24:25.479
from the tragedy,

24:25.530 --> 24:27.521
turning yourself
into me in response

24:27.560 --> 24:30.222
is not good for our partnership.

24:30.260 --> 24:31.966
_ I am not
turnIng myself Into you.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.968
I am finding my way
through my situation.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.128
Whether or_ not that works
for you Is Irrelevant.

24:37.170 --> 24:41.504
This is where I am right now,
and this is how I need to be.

24:47.750 --> 24:50.742
(Morse code beeping)

24:50.790 --> 24:53.611
(beeping continues)

24:58.860 --> 25:00.896
What are you doing?

25:00.930 --> 25:03.228
I'm tapping "Wake up, Watson"
in Morse code.

25:03.260 --> 25:05.524
(groans softly)
At around 4:00 am,

25:05.570 --> 25:08.994
I noticed an odd detail in
Species' chats with his fellow

25:09.040 --> 25:11.031
Inner Sanctum members.
There's nothing but odd,

25:11.070 --> 25:12.901
the way they talk to each other,

25:12.940 --> 25:14.271
what they think
is funny...

25:14.310 --> 25:16.130
Are you familiar
with the concept

25:16.180 --> 25:18.569
of a telegraph operator's fist?

25:18.610 --> 25:19.645
No.

25:19.680 --> 25:21.648
A "fist" is the technical term

25:21.680 --> 25:25.013
for each telegraph operator's
idiosyncratic style.

25:25.050 --> 25:28.178
How long are their dashes?
How fast are their dots?

25:28.220 --> 25:30.984
During the Second World War,
Allied intelligence was able

25:31.030 --> 25:33.225
to identify specific
German telegraph operators

25:33.260 --> 25:34.750
by their fists.

25:34.800 --> 25:36.552
So while they couldn't
necessarily decode

25:36.600 --> 25:38.022
the messages,
they could, for example,

25:38.070 --> 25:40.937
determine at any given time
where General Rommel was

25:40.970 --> 25:44.098
by searching for the fist
of his telegraph operator.

25:44.140 --> 25:45.869
So you think
there's something odd

25:45.910 --> 25:49.004
about the way that Species
types his chat messages.

25:49.040 --> 25:52.248
Indeed.
Species has two fists.

25:53.280 --> 25:55.578
Note the carriage returns.

25:59.790 --> 26:02.679
Well, he presses send more
often in this conversation

26:02.720 --> 26:04.153
than that one.

26:04.190 --> 26:05.953
1.5 times more often.

26:05.990 --> 26:07.628
And this acceleration of sends

26:07.660 --> 26:09.321
follows
a fairly regular schedule.

26:09.360 --> 26:11.692
For approximately 12 hours
on any given day,

26:11.730 --> 26:14.767
Species hits send
about every 15 words.

26:14.800 --> 26:16.267
Then, suddenly,
for the next 12 hours,

26:16.300 --> 26:17.836
he hits send every ten words.

26:17.870 --> 26:19.337
Two different fists.

26:19.370 --> 26:21.838
You think there are
two different Species?

26:21.880 --> 26:24.678
Species served as a kind
of hall monitor for Everyone.

26:24.710 --> 26:27.008
He kept an eye out
for over-the-line behavior.

26:27.050 --> 26:29.678
But protecting a collection
of computer-addicted narcissists

26:29.720 --> 26:32.712
from itself is
a 24-hour-a-day endeavor.

26:33.760 --> 26:36.149
So he split the labor.

26:36.190 --> 26:37.179
More precisely...

26:39.430 --> 26:43.196
...Errol White shared
the Species persona

26:43.230 --> 26:44.629
with this person.

26:44.670 --> 26:45.898
Tessee.

26:45.930 --> 26:48.160
HOLMES:
Tessee has the exact same fist

26:48.200 --> 26:49.895
as the second Species.

26:49.940 --> 26:53.330
Moreover, Tessee is never online
when Species Two is active.

26:53.370 --> 26:55.372
Tessee.

26:55.410 --> 26:57.970
I noticed her...
uh, him.

26:58.010 --> 26:59.671
Whatever.

26:59.710 --> 27:01.746
Tessee was all over
the Everyone chat rooms

27:01.780 --> 27:03.748
after Species' death.

27:03.790 --> 27:05.712
Tessee's political,
like Species,

27:05.750 --> 27:09.379
but when she posts as Tessee,
she's way more radical.

27:09.420 --> 27:11.388
She wants Everyone
to avenge Species,

27:11.430 --> 27:14.729
and she's been pushing something
called Operation Right Nut.

27:14.760 --> 27:17.661
No one stood to gain more
from Species's death

27:17.700 --> 27:20.828
than the faction which looked
to politicize Everyone.

27:20.870 --> 27:22.838
They gain support;
their pet causes

27:22.870 --> 27:25.236
become the pet causes
of the entire group.

27:25.270 --> 27:26.806
It's classic false flag.

27:26.840 --> 27:29.308
The death of Species strengthens
his side of the schism,

27:29.340 --> 27:31.399
while Sucking Chest Wound's
anarchist faction

27:31.450 --> 27:33.247
is utterly destroyed.

27:33.280 --> 27:36.841
So, in other words, you think
Species was killed by Species.

27:44.990 --> 27:47.254
You think Tessee's
the one who killed Species?

27:47.290 --> 27:48.848
Cuibono.

27:48.900 --> 27:51.460
With Species dead,
Tessee benefits.

27:51.500 --> 27:54.435
His death helps her
advance her agenda

27:54.470 --> 27:57.439
and pit Everyone against targets
more political in nature.

27:57.470 --> 27:59.267
Framing you
helps, too.

27:59.310 --> 28:00.937
You didn't want
to po|ItICIze the group;

28:00.980 --> 28:02.470
you wanted more anarchy.

28:02.510 --> 28:05.900
So with you in jail, she has
one less voice against her plan.

28:05.950 --> 28:08.111
Tessee's always been
a little edgy.

28:08.150 --> 28:10.710
Do you know anything about her
in real life?

28:10.750 --> 28:14.015
I mean, I don't even know
if Tessee's a her.

28:14.060 --> 28:16.711
She says she's 16
and lives in Manitoba,

28:16.760 --> 28:18.079
but I never bought that.

28:18.130 --> 28:21.019
I mean, none of us tells
the truth about that stuff.

28:21.060 --> 28:24.029
She's pushing something called
Operation Right Nut.

28:24.070 --> 28:26.061
She wants to hit
the Atherton Foundation.

28:26.100 --> 28:27.294
The Atherton
Foundaﬂon

28:27.330 --> 28:28.763
is a think tank.

28:28.800 --> 28:30.392
Conservative in the extreme.

28:30.440 --> 28:32.135
Tessee, as Tessee,
has been trying

28:32.170 --> 28:36.129
to stir up a hack
against Atherton for months.

28:36.180 --> 28:37.909
Operation Right Nut.

28:37.950 --> 28:39.804
Species came out against it.

28:39.850 --> 28:43.069
I'm guessing that's when...
Errol was at the wheel.

28:43.120 --> 28:45.281
He didn't like Atherton
either, but...

28:45.320 --> 28:48.710
thought a hack against them
would be too dangerous.

28:50.790 --> 28:52.758
You said
you're with the NYPD.

28:52.790 --> 28:54.792
We're big supporters
of law enforcement.

28:54.830 --> 28:57.765
You're partisan hacks who
twist facts until they cohere

28:57.800 --> 29:00.837
into a preexisting viewpoint,
all whilst hiding behind

29:00.870 --> 29:02.929
the seemingly academic
label of "think tank."

29:02.970 --> 29:05.302
I despise you
and people of your ilk

29:05.340 --> 29:07.535
on both sides
of the aisle.
That said,

29:07.570 --> 29:09.037
we're here to warn you
that your foundation

29:09.080 --> 29:11.844
may be the target of
the hacker collective Everyone.

29:11.880 --> 29:13.142
HOLMES:
You might want to get

29:13.180 --> 29:14.545
your cyber house in order.

29:14.580 --> 29:17.071
We would hate for your
carefully concealed donor lists

29:17.120 --> 29:18.815
to become public knowledge.

29:18.850 --> 29:21.489
Thank you for your concern.

29:21.520 --> 29:23.078
I'll walk you out.

29:23.120 --> 29:24.849
Wait, you're not worried?

29:24.890 --> 29:26.528
We've seen
what Everyone can do.

29:26.560 --> 29:29.393
We have top flight security
in place--

29:29.430 --> 29:31.569
virtual and otherwise.

29:31.600 --> 29:34.262
We can handle some...
computerIzed mob.

29:36.270 --> 29:37.931
You know, I couldn't
help but notice

29:37.970 --> 29:39.904
that many of your staff
are discreetly armed.

29:39.940 --> 29:42.170
They also seem to be
in very good shape.

29:42.210 --> 29:44.906
What exactly is it
that you do here again?

29:44.950 --> 29:47.544
As I said, uh,
thank you for your concern.

29:57.390 --> 29:58.459
(sighs)

30:01.860 --> 30:04.465
Just got off the phone
with our frenemy,

30:04.500 --> 30:06.468
Agent McNally at the NSA.

30:06.500 --> 30:08.832
He refused to discuss
the Atherton Foundation.

30:08.870 --> 30:11.532
But the way in which
he refused to discuss it

30:11.570 --> 30:13.970
leads me to believe
that they do, in fact,

30:14.010 --> 30:15.898
have some government
affiliation.

30:15.940 --> 30:17.601
Sounds like Everyone

30:17.640 --> 30:19.540
might be biting off
more than they can chew.

30:19.580 --> 30:20.569
Mm.

30:20.610 --> 30:22.919
I owe you a bit of an apology.

30:22.950 --> 30:26.442
I attempted to express my
concern for you last night,

30:26.490 --> 30:29.482
but my thoughts were distorted
by the lens of my own needs.

30:29.520 --> 30:31.988
It was not optimally done.

30:32.030 --> 30:34.157
Oh, that's okay.

30:34.200 --> 30:37.226
What I was trying to say
was that one of the things

30:37.260 --> 30:39.160
I've gained
from our collaboration

30:39.200 --> 30:41.862
is a working definition
of the word "friendship."

30:43.270 --> 30:45.261
Friendship, I've
come to believe,

30:45.310 --> 30:47.938
is most accurately
defined as two people

30:47.980 --> 30:50.505
moving towards the best
aspects of one another.

30:50.540 --> 30:53.941
It is a relationship of
mutual benefit, mutual gain.

30:53.980 --> 30:56.175
Another thing
I've learned

30:56.220 --> 30:59.417
is that my isolationist
tendencies are decidedly...

30:59.450 --> 31:01.657
not my best quality.

31:01.690 --> 31:03.920
I am not a
better person

31:03.960 --> 31:05.655
because of a_ lack
of connectIon.

31:05.690 --> 31:08.420
So I think the
healthy thing

31:08.460 --> 31:12.499
is for you not to move
in my direction.

31:12.530 --> 31:15.363
I-In fact...
quite the opposite.

31:17.400 --> 31:19.664
That's worth thinking about.

31:19.710 --> 31:20.938
Mm.

31:20.980 --> 31:23.437
Once we find Tessee, of course.

31:23.480 --> 31:26.677
Species' murderous protg
is proving elusive.

31:26.710 --> 31:30.919
Then I say we make
Tessee come to us.

31:30.950 --> 31:32.986
Now, Tessee uses
this catchphrase

31:33.020 --> 31:35.580
whenever he or she enters
or leaves a chat.

31:35.620 --> 31:37.087
"A.O.R."

31:37.120 --> 31:39.350
I dug around a bit,
and found a post

31:39.390 --> 31:40.926
where it was explained.

31:40.960 --> 31:42.928
It means: "Ariel! Ookla! Ride!"

31:42.960 --> 31:44.689
And those words are supposed
to mean something?

31:44.730 --> 31:47.198
It's the battle cry
of Thundarr the Barbarian.

31:47.230 --> 31:49.539
He's a cartoon character
from the '805.

31:49.570 --> 31:52.004
My brother was
a huge fan.
As is Tessee.

31:52.040 --> 31:53.701
Not just a fan,
but a serious collector

31:53.740 --> 31:56.004
of Thundarr memorabilia.

31:56.040 --> 31:57.268
Now, look at this user

31:57.310 --> 32:00.700
on this Thundarr
fan board.

32:00.750 --> 32:02.968
Now, MokPrincess uses the same

32:03.020 --> 32:06.114
profile picture as Tessee
and has the same fist.

32:06.150 --> 32:08.983
MokPrincess is Tessee.
Exactly.

32:09.020 --> 32:12.183
And, from what I've read,
is obsessed with obtaining

32:12.230 --> 32:15.393
a limited edition
Ookla the Mok lunch box.

32:15.430 --> 32:16.397
You have a plan?

32:16.430 --> 32:18.227
On the Everyone sites,

32:18.270 --> 32:20.522
they're always talking about
how the most powerful hack

32:20.570 --> 32:23.391
is social engineering-- tricking
people into doing what you want.

32:23.440 --> 32:26.466
_ So all I have to do
Is post on thIs fan board

32:26.510 --> 32:29.673
how I found my childhood Ookla
the Mok lunch box while I was

32:29.710 --> 32:30.677
cleaning my parents'
place out.

32:30.710 --> 32:32.507
I'll say that
I don't want it,

32:32.550 --> 32:34.245
but I'm willing to give it away

32:34.280 --> 32:37.249
to the first person who meets me
and asks me for it.

32:37.280 --> 32:39.646
Do you, in fact, have
an Ookla lunch box?

32:39.690 --> 32:42.215
I don't need one.

32:42.260 --> 32:45.081
The promise will lure people
to a public place,

32:45.130 --> 32:47.587
where I can get
a good look at them,

32:47.630 --> 32:48.722
maybe even sneak a picture.

32:48.760 --> 32:51.024
I'll tell them I already

32:51.070 --> 32:54.335
gave the lunch box away,
but that I think

32:54.370 --> 32:56.736
my brother
might still have his.

32:56.770 --> 32:59.659
All they have to do is
leave me their contact info,

32:59.710 --> 33:01.701
and I'll get in touch.

33:03.210 --> 33:05.576
So the question is:

33:05.610 --> 33:07.373
how bad does Tessee
want that lunch box?

33:14.090 --> 33:16.718
Brady Dietz. 29
years old, single,

33:16.760 --> 33:20.150
and fond of cartoon barbarians--
but you knew that already.

33:20.190 --> 33:22.658
You forgot socially awkward
and vaguely creepy.

33:22.700 --> 33:25.168
Dietz studied
information technology

33:25.200 --> 33:27.361
at Binghamton Polytechnic
until he was expelled

33:27.400 --> 33:28.469
for hacking their
computer system

33:28.500 --> 33:30.491
and altering his
friend's grades.

33:30.540 --> 33:33.304
One of a handful of infractions,
all involving computers,

33:33.340 --> 33:35.308
none of which
has stopped him

33:35.340 --> 33:37.808
finding steady work as
a freelance programmer.

33:37.840 --> 33:39.307
He fits the profile.

33:39.350 --> 33:40.749
Mm, to a T.

33:40.780 --> 33:44.284
He also works from
his home, in Brooklyn.

33:46.790 --> 33:49.418
WATSON:
Excuse me, Brady.

33:49.460 --> 33:51.428
YouTethe
lunchboxlady.

33:51.460 --> 33:52.757
Who's he?

33:52.790 --> 33:54.348
Oh, you and I are old friends.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.288
You once had me
defend the romantic

33:56.330 --> 33:58.423
_ interests of
a fIctIonal werewolf.

33:58.470 --> 34:00.665
I don't know what
you're talkIng about.

34:00.700 --> 34:02.463
Oh, I think
you do, Tessee.

34:02.500 --> 34:05.333
Or do you prefer
MokPrincess or Species?

34:05.370 --> 34:06.769
Anything other than Brady Dietz,

34:06.810 --> 34:09.335
I imagine.
Leave me alone.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.177
We're with the NYPD.
You're gonna have to speak

34:11.210 --> 34:13.349
with us eventually.
No. Go away.

34:13.380 --> 34:16.269
Why did you kill
Erroll White? Hmm?

34:16.320 --> 34:18.481
Was it as simple
as a philosophical gap?

34:18.520 --> 34:20.181
_You must've been
frIends at some pomt.

34:20.220 --> 34:21.653
You shared
the Species handle.

34:21.690 --> 34:23.783
Did you meet to discuss
your differences in person?

34:23.820 --> 34:25.526
WATSON: You're not
very good In person,

34:25.560 --> 34:26.527
are you?

34:26.560 --> 34:28.357
Maybe he
intimidated you,

34:28.400 --> 34:30.857
got physical, so you
grabbed the sword.

34:30.900 --> 34:33.767
Where were you on
Thursday night?

34:33.800 --> 34:36.530
Uh, H was... on-online,
video chatting

34:36.570 --> 34:38.367
with my girlfriend;
she's from Manitoba.

34:38.410 --> 34:40.503
What did you do with
the Japanese short sword?

34:40.540 --> 34:43.373
Is it in your apartment, hidden
under the mattress perhaps?

34:43.410 --> 34:44.547
I don't have it.
(tIres screech)

34:48.580 --> 34:50.548
FBI. Please step away
from Mr. Dietz.

34:50.580 --> 34:52.445
We're with the NYPD.

34:52.490 --> 34:54.856
I know who you are,
Ms. Watson, Mr. Holmes.

34:54.890 --> 34:57.256
You seem to have us at
a dIsadvantage, Agent...

34:57.290 --> 34:58.518
Branch.

34:58.560 --> 34:59.686
Did he just
text you?

34:59.730 --> 35:02.255
Get in the car, Brady.

35:02.300 --> 35:03.756
He is a murder suspect.
We need to talk to him.

35:03.800 --> 35:05.392
I can't allow that.

35:05.430 --> 35:08.467
Mr. Dietz is part
of an ongoing FBI investigation.

35:08.500 --> 35:11.833
He's _an informant...
agaInst Everyone.

35:14.210 --> 35:16.474
Your pet rat has just
killed a man, Erroll White.

35:16.510 --> 35:20.503
They shared an online identity,
right up until the murder.

35:20.550 --> 35:22.142
And when did this happen?

35:22.180 --> 35:24.512
Thursday night
between 7:00 and 8:30.

35:24.550 --> 35:27.439
Brady was with me from
6:00 to 9:00 on Thursday.

35:27.490 --> 35:29.458
He was giving me an update.

35:29.490 --> 35:32.527
I'm sorry.
You're done with him.

35:35.300 --> 35:36.892
The hell was that?

35:36.930 --> 35:40.161
That was the FBI
alibiing our best suspect.

35:47.970 --> 35:49.676
GREGSON:
The FBI agent, Branch--

35:49.710 --> 35:51.302
you think she
lied to you?

35:51.350 --> 35:53.341
In order to alibi Brady Dietz.

35:53.380 --> 35:55.245
Most likely 'cause she doesn't
want to give up a key asset

35:55.280 --> 35:56.838
in her investigation
into Everyone.

35:56.880 --> 35:59.246
Yeah. We were hoping you could
call someone at the Bureau,

35:59.290 --> 36:00.689
put pressure
on Branch.

36:00.720 --> 36:02.256
It's not that simple.

36:02.290 --> 36:04.258
You're asking me
to accuse a federal agent

36:04.290 --> 36:05.382
of covering up a murder.

36:05.430 --> 36:06.681
'Cause she did.

36:06.730 --> 36:08.357
Brady Dietz
killed Erroll White.

36:08.400 --> 36:09.628
We're certain of it.

36:09.660 --> 36:11.469
Why? So he could
sic Everyone

36:11.500 --> 36:13.559
on some think tank
no one's ever heard of?

36:13.600 --> 36:15.534
As I mentioned,
we have reason to believe

36:15.570 --> 36:17.959
that Atherton has some_
covert government connectIon.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.434
Look, you bring me
solid evidence,

36:20.470 --> 36:23.928
establish probable cause,
I'll put cuffs on God himself.

36:23.980 --> 36:26.904
But until then, there's
nothing I can do.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.511
(sighs)

36:32.290 --> 36:34.713
Well, he has a point.
I mean, why would an FBI agent

36:34.760 --> 36:37.285
let Everyone
hack into a government front?

36:37.320 --> 36:38.719
Maybe she didn't
know about it.

36:38.760 --> 36:40.352
No, she must.

36:40.390 --> 36:42.551
It's no secret that
DIetz, as Tessee,

36:42.600 --> 36:44.795
has been agitating for
Operation Right Nut.

36:44.830 --> 36:46.525
If Branch is
letting it proceed,

36:46.570 --> 36:47.923
it's '_cause she
wants It to proceed.

36:47.970 --> 36:49.460
Question is: why?

36:49.500 --> 36:50.967
WATSON:
Hey, I'm gonna call out

36:51.000 --> 36:53.503
for Thai.
Do you want anything?

36:53.540 --> 36:57.328
Oh, hi. I didn't realize
we had company.

36:57.380 --> 36:58.847
Briggs.

36:58.880 --> 37:00.438
Forensic accounting.

37:00.480 --> 37:02.744
Okay. Do you want Thai?

37:02.780 --> 37:04.338
HOLMES:
You've met Briggs.

37:04.390 --> 37:05.743
Very good. There
is no one better

37:05.790 --> 37:07.417
at digging into the
marrow of a company.

37:07.450 --> 37:09.714
I asked him to have a look
at the inner workings

37:09.760 --> 37:11.421
of the Atherton Foundation.

37:11.460 --> 37:12.654
Well, did he
find anything?

37:12.690 --> 37:14.555
The long and short of it is

37:14.600 --> 37:17.558
much of the money to fund
Atherton came from Wayne Vachs.

37:17.600 --> 37:18.726
As in Vachs Geological?

37:18.770 --> 37:22.399
Miner of rare earth,
fracker of oil

37:22.440 --> 37:23.998
and champion
of conservative politics.

37:24.040 --> 37:26.304
Now, Vachs founded Atherton.

37:26.340 --> 37:27.762
Atherton, in turn,
helped forge

37:27.810 --> 37:30.438
the Domestic Security
Alliance Council,

37:30.480 --> 37:33.608
or D-SAC. It's a federal
office which helps

37:33.650 --> 37:36.448
coordinate FBI and Homeland
SecurIty InvestIgatIons

37:36.480 --> 37:38.311
with the internal
securIty departments

37:38.350 --> 37:40.386
of major US. corporations.

37:40.420 --> 37:43.412
Well, that sounds
vaguely sinister.

37:43.460 --> 37:45.849
Observe the flow of funds

37:45.890 --> 37:49.451
from Atherton to D-SAC
and VIce versa.

37:49.500 --> 37:51.695
You can read this?

37:51.730 --> 37:53.561
While Atherton
initially advocated for

37:53.600 --> 37:55.397
and helped
fund D-SAC,

37:55.440 --> 37:56.964
it seems in the last year

37:57.000 --> 37:58.809
the flow of funds
has reversed itself.

37:58.840 --> 38:03.072
So you think D-SAC is paying
Atherton for something.

38:03.110 --> 38:06.648
D-SAC, and by extension,
the FBI and Homeland Security,

38:06.680 --> 38:10.047
have contracted Atherton
for classified data analysis

38:10.080 --> 38:11.889
related to counterterrorism,

38:11.920 --> 38:14.514
hence the armed agents
I observed at their offices.

38:14.560 --> 38:17.518
So, if Everyone breaks into
Atherton's computers,

38:17.560 --> 38:19.778
steals their data
and puts it on the Net...

38:19.830 --> 38:21.855
It won't just be embarrassing
a group of right wing

38:21.900 --> 38:24.562
intellectuals, they will be
publishing government secrets.

38:24.600 --> 38:26.488
You think this is
what Branch wants?

38:26.530 --> 38:29.328
Everyone's bursts of hacktivism
have become quite the thorn

38:29.370 --> 38:31.668
in the side of various
powerful entItIes.

38:31.710 --> 38:34.975
Unfortunately for Agent Branch,
Erroll "Species" White

38:35.010 --> 38:36.602
made sure that
the collectIve's crImes

38:36.640 --> 38:38.403
never amounted
to more than mIsdemeanors.

38:38.450 --> 38:40.008
Now White is dead
and Brady Dietz

38:40.050 --> 38:41.574
is leading Everyone
off a cliff.

38:41.620 --> 38:43.372
If Everyone hacks Atherton,

38:43.420 --> 38:45.615
they will fall under the purview
of the government's

38:45.650 --> 38:48.619
RICO statutes, and the group
will be broken asunder.

38:48.660 --> 38:50.719
And Branch will get credit
as the FBI agent

38:50.760 --> 38:52.648
who brought them all down.

38:52.690 --> 38:54.692
Thus reaping the governmental
and corporate benefits

38:54.730 --> 38:56.357
of same.

38:56.400 --> 38:57.890
Meteoric rise at the Bureau,

38:57.930 --> 39:00.069
lucrative private sector job--
she'll have her pick.

39:00.100 --> 39:01.533
Apparently she's willing
to protect a killer

39:01.570 --> 39:03.435
to make that happen.

39:03.470 --> 39:05.506
Too bad this is all conjecture.
We can't prove anything.

39:05.540 --> 39:08.600
Agent Branch's obstructionism
has served its purpose.

39:08.640 --> 39:12.144
We cannot tie Brady Dietz
to Erroll White's murder.

39:12.180 --> 39:14.375
Unless Agent Branch
does it for us.

39:14.420 --> 39:16.513
But why would she do that?

39:16.550 --> 39:18.142
That's why Mr. Briggs
is still here.

39:18.180 --> 39:19.818
His next task

39:19.850 --> 39:22.353
is to look into Ms. Branch's
personal ﬁnances.

39:26.660 --> 39:29.629
Agent Branch, there's
something you and I

39:29.660 --> 39:33.460
need to discuss: your agenda
with regards to Everyone.

39:33.500 --> 39:36.663
BRANCH: You think
I'm helping a killer

39:36.700 --> 39:38.565
just so I can pad my rsum?

39:38.610 --> 39:40.134
That's a hell of a theory.

39:40.170 --> 39:42.138
Well, it's the only
explanation that supports

39:42.180 --> 39:44.034
all the discernable facts.

39:46.650 --> 39:48.868
Must be frustrating.

39:48.920 --> 39:51.115
Knowing that you can't
prove any of it.

39:51.150 --> 39:53.516
I might never be able
to bring to light

39:53.550 --> 39:55.518
your machinations
against Everyone,

39:55.560 --> 39:58.654
but that's not my
primary concern.

39:58.690 --> 40:00.829
I wish to bring
Brady Dietz to justice.

40:00.860 --> 40:03.590
And that I can achieve.

40:03.630 --> 40:05.860
Once you provide me
with the murder weapon.

40:07.930 --> 40:09.591
I'm quite certain
that you've got

40:09.640 --> 40:11.699
the wakizashi
stashed somewhere.

40:11.740 --> 40:13.901
It's the only way to ensure
your mole's cooperation

40:13.940 --> 40:18.206
and protect him long enough
to complete his mission.

40:18.240 --> 40:20.743
Surrender it,

40:20.780 --> 40:23.078
and I won't tell the FBI
about your nanny.

40:23.120 --> 40:24.587
My nanny?

40:24.620 --> 40:26.747
She's Tibetan, is she not?

40:26.790 --> 40:28.587
What does that
have to do with anything?

40:28.620 --> 40:30.679
Well, Tibetan nannies
are all the rage

40:30.720 --> 40:32.927
with well-heeled New Yorkers.

40:32.960 --> 40:36.157
But they are rather pricey
for a federal employee.

40:36.200 --> 40:39.590
A forensic accountant,
however, informs me

40:39.630 --> 40:41.166
that you have found
a discount alternative.

40:41.200 --> 40:43.737
You hire one without the legal
right to work in the US,

40:43.770 --> 40:45.533
and you pay her
a fraction of the price.

40:45.570 --> 40:47.629
Now, that's just the kind
of detail that could derail

40:47.670 --> 40:49.729
a promising career
in law enforcement.

40:49.780 --> 40:52.943
So instead,
I'm just supposed to admit

40:52.980 --> 40:54.948
to obstruction of justice?

40:54.980 --> 40:59.713
Tip the police anonymously
to the weapon's whereabouts.

40:59.750 --> 41:02.719
No doubt Dietz, once arrested,
will cry cover-up,

41:02.760 --> 41:06.548
but I'm confident that's gonna
be dismissed as ranting.

41:06.590 --> 41:08.956
There's really no point
in protecting him, anyway.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.719
I've warned Everyone
that hacking Atherton

41:11.770 --> 41:13.499
would be their
death knell.

41:13.530 --> 41:16.567
They're moving on to
more amusing targets.

41:16.600 --> 41:18.659
Surrender the weapon,
you could still

41:18.710 --> 41:20.564
come out of this with
your career Intact.

41:20.610 --> 41:22.100
You could still
fulfill your ambitions.

41:22.140 --> 41:24.176
You just won't
be able to do it

41:24.210 --> 41:27.202
by duping Everyone
into committing treason.

41:28.850 --> 41:30.112
REPORTER: _
Today, NYPD InvestIgators

41:30.150 --> 41:32.584
arrested Brady Dietz
of Brooklyn Heights

41:32.620 --> 41:33.882
in the so-called
Hacker Killer murder

41:33.920 --> 41:35.717
of Erroll White.
White, a hacker

41:35.760 --> 41:37.648
and a member of the online force
known as Everyone...

41:37.690 --> 41:38.679
It's done?

41:38.730 --> 41:40.288
The bloodstained
short sword

41:40.330 --> 41:42.548
bearing Brady Dietz's prints
was delivered

41:42.600 --> 41:44.898
to the NYPD
by an anonymous source

41:44.930 --> 41:47.524
two hours ago.

41:47.570 --> 41:49.197
Initially, Dietz claimed
he'd been framed by the FBI,

41:49.240 --> 41:52.209
but when he realized it wasn't
gonna work, he confessed.

41:52.240 --> 41:53.730
Did he say
what actually happened

41:53.770 --> 41:54.976
the night of the murder?

41:55.010 --> 41:56.739
Erroll White grew suspicious

41:56.780 --> 41:58.577
that Dietz was conspiring

41:58.610 --> 42:00.703
with outside forces
to brIng down Everyone.

42:00.750 --> 42:02.911
There was a confrontation,
things turned violent.

42:02.950 --> 42:05.282
Dietz claims he acted
in self-defense.

42:05.320 --> 42:08.653
And Agent Branch just walks.

42:08.690 --> 42:10.282
Maybe she'll find being
on the wrong side of Everyone

42:10.320 --> 42:12.288
to be its own special
kind of punishment.

42:14.030 --> 42:15.327
Going out?

42:15.360 --> 42:17.294
Uh, yeah. I called Marnie.

42:17.330 --> 42:19.321
I told her I would
rejoin the bridal party.

42:19.370 --> 42:21.838
I mean, I still think it's silly
that we're all acting

42:21.870 --> 42:23.064
like we're in college, but...

42:23.100 --> 42:24.965
I thought it would be
good for me

42:25.010 --> 42:27.865
to connect with
my fellow humans.

42:28.980 --> 42:30.732
Well, enjoy yourself,

42:30.780 --> 42:32.839
Watson.

42:32.880 --> 42:34.711
I'll try.

42:34.750 --> 42:36.741
Holmes.
