00:00.880 --> 00:03.230
Narrator: Tonight on The Curse of Oak Island ...</font></font>

00:03.230 --> 00:05.340
Marty: Come on, baby! </font>'Now it's time to see</font></font>

00:05.340 --> 00:07.001
-What's in that hole. </font>-This is part</font></font>

00:07.001 --> 00:08.000
do Chappell Vault.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.590
-Wow! </font>-Rick: We know that there</font></font>

00:09.590 --> 00:11.220
significant slopes in M-8.</font></font>

00:11.220 --> 00:13.110
JACK: Charles, what is it? </font>-What's wrong with you?</font></font>

00:13.110 --> 00:16.239
It looks like as a scroll to me. </font>-DOUG: Look for red.</font></font>

00:16.239 --> 00:18.019
This color was used on really old books.</font></font>

00:18.019 --> 00:19.539
RICK: If you were in charge,</font></font>

00:19.539 --> 00:21.320
Where do you look? </font>-I would stay</font></font>

00:21.320 --> 00:22.839
for an entry that is now underwater.</font></font>

00:22.839 --> 00:23.839
Because I think there is one.</font></font>

00:23.839 --> 00:24.839
-LAIRD: Hey, Rick? </font>-Yes?</font></font>

00:24.839 --> 00:25.839
-We found something. </font>Oh man.</font></font>

00:25.839 --> 00:26.839
What the hell could this be?</font></font>

00:26.839 --> 00:35.210
Narrator: There is an island in the North Atlantic</font></font>

00:35.210 --> 00:42.010
where people were looking for an incredible treasure</font></font>

00:42.010 --> 00:43.010
for over 200 years.</font></font>

00:43.010 --> 00:44.800
So far, they found a stone slab</font></font>

00:44.800 --> 00:47.830
with strange symbols carved into it,</font></font>

00:47.830 --> 00:50.760
mysterious human bone fragments,</font></font>

00:50.760 --> 00:54.460
and a lead cross whose origin can go back</font></font>

00:54.460 --> 00:57.210
to the days of the Knights Templar.</font></font>

00:57.210 --> 01:12.319
So far, six men died trying to solve the mystery.</font></font>

01:12.319 --> 01:26.460
And, according to legend,</font></font>

01:26.460 --> 01:39.299
another will have to die</font></font>

01:39.299 --> 01:41.950
before the treasure can be found.</font></font>

01:41.950 --> 01:43.209
GARY: Wow, that's a piece of a wall, is not it?</font></font>

01:43.209 --> 01:44.209
LAIRD: Yep.

01:44.209 --> 01:45.209
RICK: It's very strange.</font></font>

01:45.209 --> 01:46.579
Narrator: For brothers Rick and Marty Lagina,</font></font>

01:46.579 --> 01:49.049
performing of a dream lifelong</font></font>

01:49.049 --> 01:53.049
to solve the 223-year-old mystery of Oak Island</font></font>

01:53.049 --> 01:55.569
You can now be closer than ever,</font></font>

01:55.569 --> 01:58.279
as they continue to make incredible discoveries</font></font>

01:58.279 --> 01:59.390
in Smith's Cove.</font></font>

01:59.390 --> 02:02.990
RICK: What do you think?</font></font>

02:02.990 --> 02:03.990
Someone wanted something permanent.</font></font>

02:03.990 --> 02:05.649
'So what does that mean? </font>- (n)</font></font>

02:05.649 --> 02:08.310
-Yes. </font>-At the end of the launch pad ...</font></font>

02:08.310 --> 02:09.800
A piece of concrete.</font></font>

02:09.800 --> 02:11.510
You tell me what that means.</font></font>

02:11.510 --> 02:17.160
Have you ever seen anything like this before, Laird?</font></font>

02:17.160 --> 02:19.670
Underwater -No. </font>- (laughing)</font></font>

02:19.670 --> 02:22.070
NARRATOR: a few moments,</font></font>

02:22.070 --> 02:23.950
while digging up what appears to be</font></font>

02:23.950 --> 02:27.740
an antique wooden shipping dock or launch ramp,</font></font>

02:27.740 --> 02:31.940
archaeologist Laird Niven made another surprising discovery:</font></font>

02:31.940 --> 02:35.390
a concrete wall buried approximately three feet</font></font>

02:35.390 --> 02:37.220
below the ocean floor.</font></font>

02:37.220 --> 02:39.440
I think there is a way to concrete date?</font></font>

02:39.440 --> 02:41.960
-Yes. </font>This material? </font>-The Romans had, uh,</font></font>

02:41.960 --> 02:43.720
concrete that would set underwater.</font></font>

02:43.720 --> 02:45.930
-Same? </font>-This could be easily ...</font></font>

02:45.930 --> 02:47.370
incredibly old.</font></font>

02:47.370 --> 02:49.580
Now, that's a good sign</font></font>

02:49.580 --> 02:50.760
when you are not getting any metal</font></font>

02:50.760 --> 02:53.430
the actual concrete wall.</font></font>

02:53.430 --> 02:56.210
What the hell could this be?</font></font>

02:56.210 --> 02:59.280
NARRATOR: Why the mysterious concrete wall</font></font>

02:59.280 --> 03:02.980
is defined under high tide level and contains no metal,</font></font>

03:02.980 --> 03:06.340
It is the belief of the team that he may have been built</font></font>

03:06.340 --> 03:08.650
using engineering techniques</font></font>

03:08.650 --> 03:10.890
first developed by the ancient Romans</font></font>

03:10.890 --> 03:15.110
already in the third century BC</font></font>

03:15.110 --> 03:18.690
By mixing volcanic ash with other native minerals,</font></font>

03:18.690 --> 03:21.100
They created a single concrete mix,</font></font>

03:21.100 --> 03:23.400
that when poured underwater,</font></font>

03:23.400 --> 03:26.710
would harden and set.</font></font>

03:26.710 --> 03:28.370
There are many who have theorized</font></font>

03:28.370 --> 03:30.600
that even sophisticated knowledge</font></font>

03:30.600 --> 03:32.320
It would have been necessary to build</font></font>

03:32.320 --> 03:35.760
elaborate system of tunnels island trapped flood,</font></font>

03:35.760 --> 03:38.610
which are also believed to be similar in design</font></font>

03:38.610 --> 03:40.040
to Roman aqueducts.</font></font>

03:40.040 --> 03:43.960
RICK: You know, at this time, the Smith Creek in the treaties</font></font>

03:43.960 --> 03:45.870
So many questions,</font></font>

03:45.870 --> 03:50.340
and now here we have another wall previously unknown</font></font>

03:50.340 --> 03:53.740
in close proximity to other structures.</font></font>

03:53.740 --> 03:55.271
Therefore, it is very possible that,</font></font>

03:55.271 --> 03:57.890
This discovery process as a product,</font></font>

03:57.890 --> 04:00.690
we may indeed finally, once and for all,</font></font>

04:00.690 --> 04:03.100
prove who, when, why.</font></font>

04:03.100 --> 04:05.730
That's why we are here on Smith Creek.</font></font>

04:05.730 --> 04:10.750
Hey, Rick? </font>-Yes?</font></font>

04:10.750 --> 04:15.380
Um, we find something for you to look.</font></font>

04:15.380 --> 04:16.779
What is it?</font></font>

04:16.779 --> 04:18.510
LAIRD: two connected tubes.</font></font>

04:18.510 --> 04:22.320
-And they do not take. </font>-They do not look metal to me.</font></font>

04:22.320 --> 04:24.220
LAIRD: They are not leading, no.</font></font>

04:24.220 --> 04:26.030
RICK: This is almost a ...</font></font>

04:26.030 --> 04:28.040
rubbery consistency, right, Laird?</font></font>

04:28.040 --> 04:31.440
Yes, he is, is not it? </font>-Yes.</font></font>

04:31.440 --> 04:33.350
And rubber could have been around for a long time.</font></font>

04:33.350 --> 04:35.580
LAIRD: Well, I found rubber 1850s.</font></font>

04:35.580 --> 04:38.139
rubber tubes SPEAKER?</font></font>

04:38.139 --> 04:39.930
Possibly from the mid-19th century?</font></font>

04:39.930 --> 04:43.380
Although the natural rubber was known</font></font>

04:43.380 --> 04:46.850
and used by the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica</font></font>

04:46.850 --> 04:49.850
as early as 1600 BC,</font></font>

04:49.850 --> 04:52.370
it was not until the mid-19th century</font></font>

04:52.370 --> 04:55.260
the chemist and engineer Charles Goodyear</font></font>

04:55.260 --> 04:58.520
He found a way to improve the substance,</font></font>

04:58.520 --> 05:01.750
which led to widespread manufacture of rubber products</font></font>

05:01.750 --> 05:06.340
such as tires, hoses, and footwear.</font></font>

05:06.340 --> 05:09.220
Could the tubes found inside the concrete wall</font></font>

05:09.220 --> 05:13.310
be the work of 19th century researchers in Oak Island?</font></font>

05:13.310 --> 05:16.600
Or is another confusing layer</font></font>

05:16.600 --> 05:20.020
a mystery team still has to struggle to solve?</font></font>

05:20.020 --> 05:24.320
RICK: Dan, we have a mystery to you.</font></font>

05:24.320 --> 05:27.190
-Imagine that. </font>-OK.</font></font>

05:27.190 --> 05:28.190
What is it?</font></font>

05:28.190 --> 05:31.230
And you know anything about these tubes?</font></font>

05:31.230 --> 05:34.460
EH:. </font>Hmm.</font></font>

05:34.460 --> 05:35.530
At the.</font></font>

05:35.530 --> 05:39.840
I suppose the mystery is: Why would anyone build</font></font>

05:39.840 --> 05:42.800
something and then not mention to anyone</font></font>

05:42.800 --> 05:44.550
-or have any record of it? </font>-Exactly.</font></font>

05:44.550 --> 05:46.500
LAIRD: I was containg something?</font></font>

05:46.500 --> 05:49.160
He was holding something?</font></font>

05:49.160 --> 05:52.820
It was providing something?</font></font>

05:52.820 --> 05:55.290
Yes.</font></font>

05:55.290 --> 06:00.230
(Sighs): Yeah.</font></font>

06:00.230 --> 06:01.230
Smith Cove.</font></font>

06:01.230 --> 06:07.610
I thought it would be a simple excavation,</font></font>

06:07.610 --> 06:10.160
find artifacts, find out who and when.</font></font>

06:10.160 --> 06:13.040
You know, it just goes on ...</font></font>

06:13.040 --> 06:14.040
Getting wonkier.</font></font>

06:14.040 --> 06:17.110
"Wonkier" is a good word, yes.</font></font>

06:17.110 --> 06:22.470
RICK: Well, we have some research to do.</font></font>

06:22.470 --> 06:25.340
Narrator: In the late afternoon ...</font></font>

06:25.340 --> 06:26.720
(Ring) line</font></font>

06:26.720 --> 06:28.790
RICK: Hey, guys.</font></font>

06:28.790 --> 06:31.560
-Paul: Hey. </font>Marty: Hello.</font></font>

06:31.560 --> 06:32.940
Marty. Craig.

06:32.940 --> 06:34.370
... Rick Lagina calls a meeting</font></font>

06:34.370 --> 06:37.090
in the war room to update his brother Marty</font></font>

06:37.090 --> 06:39.900
and members of the Oak Island team</font></font>

06:39.900 --> 06:42.750
on the intriguing developments in Smith Cove.</font></font>

06:42.750 --> 06:45.290
RICK: Well, I think we all agree</font></font>

06:45.290 --> 06:46.290
today was a ...</font></font>

06:46.290 --> 06:49.310
a very strange day in Smith Creek, right?</font></font>

06:49.310 --> 06:50.520
-Yes. </font>-Yes.</font></font>

06:50.520 --> 06:55.510
I would bet that because we sent him the photos,</font></font>

06:55.510 --> 06:58.230
you are as confused as we are.</font></font>

06:58.230 --> 07:02.030
That would be a fair bet, Rick. </font>That would be a fair bet.</font></font>

07:02.030 --> 07:04.570
RICK: We were on an emotional roller coaster</font></font>

07:04.570 --> 07:05.919
Oak Island, right?</font></font>

07:05.919 --> 07:07.729
We checked in a concrete structure</font></font>

07:07.729 --> 07:10.449
how we are pursuing the launch pad.</font></font>

07:10.449 --> 07:11.860
And we're ecstatic.</font></font>

07:11.860 --> 07:15.090
We-we are thinking-- Marty, you know Roman history.</font></font>

07:15.090 --> 07:17.419
-Right. </font>-Pantheon, the Colosseum,</font></font>

07:17.419 --> 07:18.720
the underwater pier.</font></font>

07:18.720 --> 07:21.970
They knew concrete mixes back and forth.</font></font>

07:21.970 --> 07:24.380
Yes. It's the kind of remains even stranger,</font></font>

07:24.380 --> 07:25.380
because I...</font></font>

07:25.380 --> 07:26.380
I like to think I have a vivid imagination,</font></font>

07:26.380 --> 07:31.190
(Laughs), and I can not come up with a use for this thing.</font></font>

07:31.190 --> 07:32.440
(Laughing)</font></font>

07:32.440 --> 07:36.190
You can, Dave?</font></font>

07:36.190 --> 07:37.630
You know, you have more experience in construction</font></font>

07:37.630 --> 07:38.680
than any of us.</font></font>

07:38.680 --> 07:40.729
Do you have any idea</font></font>

07:40.729 --> 07:42.630
by tubes through a concrete wall?</font></font>

07:42.630 --> 07:44.699
I have no idea why they would put</font></font>

07:44.699 --> 07:47.800
tubes -two inches it. </font>-Right next to each other, too,</font></font>

07:47.800 --> 07:48.800
-right? </font>-Yes.</font></font>

07:48.800 --> 07:50.100
I have a total blank.</font></font>

07:50.100 --> 07:52.110
-Dave: We all do. </font>CHARLES: Yeah.</font></font>

07:52.110 --> 07:54.840
MARTY: Guys, this is a kind of, maybe,</font></font>

07:54.840 --> 07:57.240
out of right field, but what is the chance</font></font>

07:57.240 --> 07:59.560
that the concrete wall is much older</font></font>

07:59.560 --> 08:02.710
of the pipes that are sticking with it?</font></font>

08:02.710 --> 08:04.250
In other words, someone found it,</font></font>

08:04.250 --> 08:06.690
holes through it, put there tubes.</font></font>

08:06.690 --> 08:09.260
I mean, there is some evidence that,</font></font>

08:09.260 --> 08:11.190
-or could this be? </font>-It's possible.</font></font>

08:11.190 --> 08:12.190
Yes.</font></font>

08:12.190 --> 08:13.230
Narrator: It was in 1850</font></font>

08:13.230 --> 08:15.900
researchers Company Truro</font></font>

08:15.900 --> 08:18.270
first discovered the drains of legendary stone box</font></font>

08:18.270 --> 08:19.949
in Smith Creek</font></font>

08:19.949 --> 08:21.830
by building a clay cofferdam</font></font>

08:21.830 --> 08:23.980
before draing area.</font></font>

08:23.980 --> 08:26.160
it's possible</font></font>

08:26.160 --> 08:29.139
that treasure hunters of the 19th century in Oak Island</font></font>

08:29.139 --> 08:31.970
modified a much older structure</font></font>

08:31.970 --> 08:34.820
in order to help them dig Cove Smith?</font></font>

08:34.820 --> 08:37.649
It has been quite remarkable</font></font>

08:37.649 --> 08:39.760
how many structures are in Cove Smith</font></font>

08:39.760 --> 08:41.760
I did not know were there.</font></font>

08:41.760 --> 08:44.059
So we're always scratching our head.</font></font>

08:44.059 --> 08:46.870
RICK: But it's important to reach an understanding,</font></font>

08:46.870 --> 08:50.149
because hope, understanding, research,</font></font>

08:50.149 --> 08:51.440
put the puzzle pieces together</font></font>

08:51.440 --> 08:52.900
will take us where we want to go.</font></font>

08:52.900 --> 08:55.630
And where we want to go is to find the original money pit.</font></font>

08:55.630 --> 08:57.680
You know, the interesting thing</font></font>

08:57.680 --> 09:00.830
in connection with this "concrete structure" it is,</font></font>

09:00.830 --> 09:03.520
you know, we pay more attention to the launch pad.</font></font>

09:03.520 --> 09:04.520
Yes.</font></font>

09:04.520 --> 09:06.250
GARY: When you look at it ...</font></font>

09:06.250 --> 09:09.950
slipway, you see all the logs are used in it.</font></font>

09:09.950 --> 09:11.960
I think it's basically</font></font>

09:11.960 --> 09:17.210
a large ramp that goes all the way to the Money Pit.</font></font>

09:17.210 --> 09:18.500
You think it's original.</font></font>

09:18.500 --> 09:20.950
I really do.</font></font>

09:20.950 --> 09:24.310
I believe launch ramp is the glory road.</font></font>

09:24.310 --> 09:26.110
That is where we will find some things.</font></font>

09:26.110 --> 09:28.060
MARTY: Yeah. I certainly like</font></font>

09:28.060 --> 09:29.350
to dig underneath it.</font></font>

09:29.350 --> 09:31.630
Yes, I think it will be worth it.</font></font>

09:31.630 --> 09:32.920
Oh, yeah, sure.</font></font>

09:32.920 --> 09:35.080
And there might even be an older ...</font></font>

09:35.080 --> 09:36.810
-feature underneath it. </font>-Exactly.</font></font>

09:36.810 --> 09:39.840
MARTY: Here's what we can say for sure.</font></font>

09:39.840 --> 09:41.810
The more you dig in Smith's Cove,</font></font>

09:41.810 --> 09:43.250
the more surprises you find.</font></font>

09:43.250 --> 09:44.561
I mean, look what we have.</font></font>

09:44.561 --> 09:46.530
We have an unknown concrete wall.</font></font>

09:46.530 --> 09:47.779
We have an L-shaped structure</font></font>

09:47.779 --> 09:50.500
that is to be transformed into a giant structure.</font></font>

09:50.500 --> 09:52.300
We have a slipway which we thought was</font></font>

09:52.300 --> 09:54.240
type of accessory for all,</font></font>

09:54.240 --> 09:56.890
and it can actually be the key to everything.</font></font>

09:56.890 --> 10:00.250
So, you know, it's easy for us to say, but ...</font></font>

10:00.250 --> 10:02.610
go back and find out.</font></font>

10:02.610 --> 10:04.260
Fair. </font>There is much to do.</font></font>

10:04.260 --> 10:05.620
-no question about it. </font>Marty: Yeah.</font></font>

10:05.620 --> 10:07.490
We will soon join you.</font></font>

10:07.490 --> 10:10.810
-Rick: All right. </font>Marty: I see you.</font></font>

10:10.810 --> 10:14.130
-Rick: See you. </font>-LAIRD: See you later.</font></font>

10:14.130 --> 10:18.250
NARRATOR: As the excavation of the Smith Creek continues,</font></font>

10:18.250 --> 10:20.110
Rick Lagina and Dave Blankenship</font></font>

10:20.110 --> 10:22.320
get to the house Dave's father,</font></font>

10:22.320 --> 10:24.459
Veteran Oak Island treasure hunter, Dan Blankenship.</font></font>

10:24.459 --> 10:26.860
How are you doing, Dad? </font>-Dan. B: Hi, Dave.</font></font>

10:26.860 --> 10:29.250
NARRATOR: They are hoping he can provide answers</font></font>

10:29.250 --> 10:31.380
for key issues that have</font></font>

10:31.380 --> 10:33.700
about the mysterious concrete wall</font></font>

10:33.700 --> 10:35.140
She found earlier today.</font></font>

10:35.140 --> 10:36.380
RICK: So ...</font></font>

10:36.380 --> 10:39.750
We are hoping that you can enlighten us.</font></font>

10:39.750 --> 10:43.790
We are-we are bringing you another puzzle.</font></font>

10:43.790 --> 10:47.209
Narrator: In more than five decades</font></font>

10:47.209 --> 10:48.390
Dan spent living</font></font>

10:48.390 --> 10:51.130
and search for treasure on Oak Island,</font></font>

10:51.130 --> 10:54.380
he gathered a wealth of first-hand information.</font></font>

10:54.380 --> 10:56.680
In the early 1970s,</font></font>

10:56.680 --> 11:00.200
he and his partner, David Tobias,</font></font>

11:00.200 --> 11:03.110
He constructed a massive cofferdam in Smith Creek</font></font>

11:03.110 --> 11:05.279
hoping to find the remains</font></font>

11:05.279 --> 11:08.649
the legendary stone box drains.</font></font>

11:08.649 --> 11:10.720
It was during this digging</font></font>

11:10.720 --> 11:14.420
Dan made a number of surprising discoveries,</font></font>

11:14.420 --> 11:17.310
including two massive wood structures,</font></font>

11:17.310 --> 11:23.480
one laid out in the form of an "L" and the other a "U"</font></font>

11:23.480 --> 11:25.570
discovered that the Laginas and his team</font></font>

11:25.570 --> 11:27.959
recently discovered.</font></font>

11:27.959 --> 11:32.420
Now, you know Smith Cove, as well as anyone.</font></font>

11:32.420 --> 11:35.920
Okay, so here's the sheet pile, right?</font></font>

11:35.920 --> 11:37.890
-Dan B: Yes. -Rick:. Like that.</font></font>

11:37.890 --> 11:40.490
We discovered the U-shaped structure</font></font>

11:40.490 --> 11:44.730
Then the U-shaped structure is outside.</font></font>

11:44.730 --> 11:46.860
And we were following this,</font></font>

11:46.860 --> 11:50.980
trying to figure out where it ended, and suddenly,</font></font>

11:50.980 --> 11:54.200
right here, there's this thing.</font></font>

11:54.200 --> 11:58.600
DAN B:. Is your concrete wall.</font></font>

11:58.600 --> 12:00.410
-Rick: Yep. </font>-Dave. B: five inches thick,</font></font>

12:00.410 --> 12:03.140
and it is three feet tall, the concrete itself.</font></font>

12:03.140 --> 12:06.779
RICK: But there are pipes on the bottom right.</font></font>

12:06.779 --> 12:12.390
DAN B:. If you're asking me if I had seen any of it,</font></font>

12:12.390 --> 12:13.940
The answer is obviously no.</font></font>

12:13.940 --> 12:17.040
who could have done this?</font></font>

12:17.040 --> 12:20.279
It had to be before 1950.</font></font>

12:20.279 --> 12:24.820
Restall never done any work like that.</font></font>

12:24.820 --> 12:29.089
I saw what Restall did in '65,</font></font>

12:29.089 --> 12:32.050
and all he did was what I call surface work.</font></font>

12:32.050 --> 12:34.160
RICK: But nothing like this.</font></font>

12:34.160 --> 12:35.160
At the.</font></font>

12:35.160 --> 12:38.500
There was a lot of work done in Cove Smith.</font></font>

12:38.500 --> 12:40.470
Who made this? </font>I do not know.</font></font>

12:40.470 --> 12:43.950
I do not have your records.</font></font>

12:43.950 --> 12:46.110
The only thing about, you know, our problems</font></font>

12:46.110 --> 12:48.290
with the file record is that</font></font>

12:48.290 --> 12:51.740
most people were so entranced</font></font>

12:51.740 --> 12:54.140
with the idea of â€‹â€‹treasure</font></font>

12:54.140 --> 12:56.780
that recording data was not mandatory.</font></font>

12:56.780 --> 12:58.590
It was the first guideline.</font></font>

12:58.590 --> 13:01.410
And so, it may be an original work,</font></font>

13:01.410 --> 13:03.740
It can be a researcher working illegally.</font></font>

13:03.740 --> 13:06.690
We do not know, and that's the problem.</font></font>

13:06.690 --> 13:08.880
DAVE B:. Right in front of that concrete wall.</font></font>

13:08.880 --> 13:09.880
RICK: Right-right in front of him</font></font>

13:09.880 --> 13:12.459
is that slipway, pier,</font></font>

13:12.459 --> 13:14.500
-a old launch pad. </font>-This is important.</font></font>

13:14.500 --> 13:18.550
I mean, to try and just get a couple of pieces out</font></font>

13:18.550 --> 13:20.649
-and have it carbon-dated. </font>-Rick: Mm-hmm.</font></font>

13:20.649 --> 13:22.700
See if you can put an age to launching pad.</font></font>

13:22.700 --> 13:26.519
Yes, there are no catches there.</font></font>

13:26.519 --> 13:27.519
None.</font></font>

13:27.519 --> 13:29.460
So that was ... I mean, my God,</font></font>

13:29.460 --> 13:32.850
nails were out for God knows how long, you know?</font></font>

13:32.850 --> 13:34.310
RICK: Gary Drayton came</font></font>

13:34.310 --> 13:35.779
with an idea that</font></font>

13:35.779 --> 13:40.140
if you are downloading things off of a ship</font></font>

13:40.140 --> 13:43.459
and you build this launching pad to the records, right?</font></font>

13:43.459 --> 13:46.200
-Right. </font>If you do not arrest them,</font></font>

13:46.200 --> 13:47.839
you put something heavy there,</font></font>

13:47.839 --> 13:50.510
then you can roll it up the launch pad.</font></font>

13:50.510 --> 13:54.700
These people were ... they had to use creativity.</font></font>

13:54.700 --> 13:57.200
-There is no doubt about it. </font>-Yes.</font></font>

13:57.200 --> 13:59.790
We thought we were going to dig Cove Smith</font></font>

13:59.790 --> 14:01.230
and get some answers, but ...</font></font>

14:01.230 --> 14:02.990
Whatever you come up with is questions.</font></font>

14:02.990 --> 14:04.709
They have been few and far between.</font></font>

14:04.709 --> 14:07.269
We have some explaing to do, so it's best</font></font>

14:07.269 --> 14:08.730
-Go out there and do it -Yep.</font></font>

14:08.730 --> 14:13.240
DAN B:. Back to the drawing board.</font></font>

14:13.240 --> 14:18.700
(All laugh)</font></font>

14:18.700 --> 14:23.459
Narrator: The next day, Marty Lagina</font></font>

14:23.459 --> 14:25.529
and his partner Craig Tester meet</font></font>

14:25.529 --> 14:28.490
Marty brother Rick, his son Alex,</font></font>

14:28.490 --> 14:32.100
and other members of his team at the Money Pit site.</font></font>

14:32.100 --> 14:38.633
Mike, you calculated the plug fall?</font></font>

14:38.633 --> 14:40.890
This morning, the plug was right at the bottom of the can.</font></font>

14:40.890 --> 14:42.970
-OK. </font>-E then went</font></font>

14:42.970 --> 14:44.850
down within a foot bottom,</font></font>

14:44.850 --> 14:47.330
and we can even in two feet.</font></font>

14:47.330 --> 14:49.110
-OK. </font>-So we ... technically,</font></font>

14:49.110 --> 14:52.130
three feet of material.</font></font>

14:52.130 --> 14:55.779
-Charles. Marty. Craig.

14:55.779 --> 15:00.180
The only thing that's coming out now.</font></font>

15:00.180 --> 15:01.670
NARRATOR: Working with representatives</font></font>

15:01.670 --> 15:05.560
Irving Equipment Limited, Laginas and its partners</font></font>

15:05.560 --> 15:08.610
continuing excavation axis H-8.</font></font>

15:08.610 --> 15:11.079
An axis that they believe</font></font>

15:11.079 --> 15:15.480
They may have crossed the original money pit.</font></font>

15:15.480 --> 15:17.070
It was here last year,</font></font>

15:17.070 --> 15:19.860
the team found amazing tracks</font></font>

15:19.860 --> 15:24.080
below a depth of 160 feet,</font></font>

15:24.080 --> 15:28.260
including pieces of paper and leather binding,</font></font>

15:28.260 --> 15:31.930
human bones from the 17th century,</font></font>

15:31.930 --> 15:34.680
and even wooden box of evidence to seven feet tall</font></font>

15:34.680 --> 15:39.279
first reported by treasure hunters in 1897.</font></font>

15:39.279 --> 15:42.510
Unfortunately, when the team tried</font></font>

15:42.510 --> 15:44.649
to penetrate the mysterious object</font></font>

15:44.649 --> 15:47.089
using a 50 inch wide drilling caisson,</font></font>

15:47.089 --> 15:50.170
they believe it was actually pushed aside</font></font>

15:50.170 --> 15:52.339
and a large empty, muddy</font></font>

15:52.339 --> 15:54.350
located at a depth of about 170 feet.</font></font>

15:54.350 --> 15:55.889
CRAIG: Something was in front of the can,</font></font>

15:55.889 --> 15:58.740
and we were pushing it for a while,</font></font>

15:58.740 --> 16:02.779
and he was pushing all the clay out of the way.</font></font>

16:02.779 --> 16:06.130
It is still there, then. </font>-Exactly.</font></font>

16:06.130 --> 16:08.000
-Hello. </font>-Hello.</font></font>

16:08.000 --> 16:17.020
So, uh, you're making five feet up and down a few times?</font></font>

16:17.020 --> 16:18.020
-OK. </font>-Yes.</font></font>

16:18.020 --> 16:19.120
VANESSA: We are bringing to five,</font></font>

16:19.120 --> 16:20.700
and then back up and down,</font></font>

16:20.700 --> 16:23.060
and kind of just working down the can.</font></font>

16:23.060 --> 16:24.490
John -If there monitoring to see</font></font>

16:24.490 --> 16:26.639
if he feels something different in the making,</font></font>

16:26.639 --> 16:28.190
If nothing is coming -Craig: Ok ..</font></font>

16:28.190 --> 16:30.230
VANESSA: But we'll probably get off on, uh,</font></font>

16:30.230 --> 16:33.630
working up and down, down about 15 feet,</font></font>

16:33.630 --> 16:35.420
and then to obtain a good measurement,</font></font>

16:35.420 --> 16:37.900
see if anything is coming, and then continue the process.</font></font>

16:37.900 --> 16:38.900
OK.

16:38.900 --> 16:41.570
Yes, I think once we get down,</font></font>

16:41.570 --> 16:43.040
even if they do not measure anything,</font></font>

16:43.040 --> 16:45.310
go ahead and take a couple of hammer win.</font></font>

16:45.310 --> 16:48.940
-Just in case something fell, but ... -For sure. </font>Yes.</font></font>

16:48.940 --> 16:51.610
CRAIG: Why is pushed out somewhere, you know.</font></font>

16:51.610 --> 16:53.450
-Yes. </font>Yes. 'So whatever we need</font></font>

16:53.450 --> 16:57.220
She pushed him out back, so ...</font></font>

16:57.220 --> 17:00.430
NARRATOR: It is the hope of the team Oak Island</font></font>

17:00.430 --> 17:03.560
that by raising the steel coffin to several feet</font></font>

17:03.560 --> 17:07.329
the most valuable clues, or perhaps the vault itself,</font></font>

17:07.329 --> 17:09.560
You can move back into his path,</font></font>

17:09.560 --> 17:11.809
they can try, then recover</font></font>

17:11.809 --> 17:14.189
using a claw hammer tool of three tons.</font></font>

17:14.189 --> 17:17.650
VANESSA: We are in depth casing 194,</font></font>

17:17.650 --> 17:20.619
and we have a plug-two feet.</font></font>

17:20.619 --> 17:26.270
-Two plug-foot? </font>-You want us to go back up</font></font>

17:26.270 --> 17:27.270
and try to get more?</font></font>

17:27.270 --> 17:29.460
MARTY: Let's ... let's grab.</font></font>

17:29.460 --> 17:31.010
I mean, I mean, I would not take much material</font></font>

17:31.010 --> 17:32.720
have fallen under to be interesting.</font></font>

17:32.720 --> 17:33.720
Yes, we might as well. </font>Yes, OK.</font></font>

17:33.720 --> 17:34.920
Let's go ahead and do it. </font>Let's take a claw,</font></font>

17:34.920 --> 17:36.100
then we might want to come up and work it out.</font></font>

17:36.100 --> 17:37.100
-That's nice. </font>-OK.</font></font>

17:37.100 --> 17:38.100
Yes, we can do this.</font></font>

17:38.100 --> 17:39.100
-Rick: What-what is it? </font>-Craig: It's a little</font></font>

17:39.100 --> 17:42.170
the muddy side.</font></font>

17:42.170 --> 17:56.230
RICK: What's it?</font></font>

17:56.230 --> 18:07.480
CRAIG: The middle?</font></font>

18:07.480 --> 18:13.100
This is amazing.</font></font>

18:13.100 --> 18:19.179
I have a bag here.</font></font>

18:19.179 --> 18:20.179
RICK: Just over here.</font></font>

18:20.179 --> 18:22.260
CRAIG: These are great pieces to be at this depth.</font></font>

18:22.260 --> 18:24.610
Well, what depth, however, Craig?</font></font>

18:24.610 --> 18:26.800
-This ... Well, it has to be lower</font></font>

18:26.800 --> 18:28.059
1-7 ... ... 68 -1 -168.</font></font>

18:28.059 --> 18:31.190
I thought we were too deep for Chappell Vault,</font></font>

18:31.190 --> 18:33.720
but I'm wondering if this is part of Chappell Vault.</font></font>

18:33.720 --> 18:38.000
NARRATOR: Wood? </font>Chappell's Vault?</font></font>

18:38.000 --> 18:41.240
Found more than 170 feet deep in H-8?</font></font>

18:41.240 --> 18:44.210
Could the team have successfully located</font></font>

18:44.210 --> 18:46.730
the legend box believed to contain</font></font>

18:46.730 --> 18:48.500
the treasure of Oak Island?</font></font>

18:48.500 --> 18:52.010
RICK: These are all pieces of the puzzle, clues.</font></font>

18:52.010 --> 18:54.931
Look, each track is important to find it,</font></font>

18:54.931 --> 18:58.000
especially H-8, which in turn is confirmation</font></font>

18:58.000 --> 19:00.850
that there is something going on here,</font></font>

19:00.850 --> 19:03.240
um, it is-is positive news.</font></font>

19:03.240 --> 19:05.940
NARRATOR: The possibility that the team</font></font>

19:05.940 --> 19:08.350
located evidence of Chappell Vault</font></font>

19:08.350 --> 19:10.710
It offers more than an exciting prospect.</font></font>

19:10.710 --> 19:12.220
Yes, here we go.</font></font>

19:12.220 --> 19:15.590
NARRATOR: It now requires that every piece of loot</font></font>

19:15.590 --> 19:17.740
We brought up from the axis H-8</font></font>

19:17.740 --> 19:20.200
be examined more closely than usual</font></font>

19:20.200 --> 19:23.520
in an effort to see if they contain important clues</font></font>

19:23.520 --> 19:26.880
or evidence of treasure.</font></font>

19:26.880 --> 19:31.510
Hey, Charles!

19:31.510 --> 19:36.140
CHARLES: Ok.

19:36.140 --> 19:38.450
Ufa.</font></font>

19:38.450 --> 19:44.130
That's a sizeable chunk.</font></font>

19:44.130 --> 19:49.070
Yes, this is.</font></font>

19:49.070 --> 19:50.370
What about this wood, Charles?</font></font>

19:50.370 --> 19:52.380
It is not as light as the other pieces.</font></font>

19:52.380 --> 19:53.790
And it's not completely black, either.</font></font>

19:53.790 --> 19:57.270
Let's save that, uh ... let it go.</font></font>

19:57.270 --> 20:06.679
Hey, Charles, what is it?</font></font>

20:06.679 --> 20:18.440
CHARLES: What do you think?</font></font>

20:18.440 --> 20:20.650
I'm thinking it's definitely a fibrous material.</font></font>

20:20.650 --> 20:22.130
CHARLES: Yep. </font>JACK: Looks</font></font>

20:22.130 --> 20:24.960
the scroll to me.</font></font>

20:24.960 --> 20:31.210
JACK: Hey, Charles, what is it?</font></font>

20:31.210 --> 20:35.200
SPEAKER: While searching through M-8 spoils</font></font>

20:35.200 --> 20:37.700
Jack Begley and Charles Barkhouse</font></font>

20:37.700 --> 20:40.770
I have only found a potentially important clue,</font></font>

20:40.770 --> 20:42.870
one that could prove that the team</font></font>

20:42.870 --> 20:46.990
It is closer than ever to find the mysterious Vault Chappell.</font></font>

20:46.990 --> 20:49.620
JACK: It seems that the scroll to me.</font></font>

20:49.620 --> 20:52.090
It-it's definitely ... uh, we definitely</font></font>

20:52.090 --> 20:55.280
-have the bag. </font>Yes. -It's just black. </font>Yes.</font></font>

20:55.280 --> 20:56.450
This ... this means only that it was</font></font>

20:56.450 --> 20:57.840
in water for a long time.</font></font>

20:57.840 --> 20:59.580
JACK: Yes CHARLES:. Do you understand?</font></font>

20:59.580 --> 21:01.720
JACK: I think this is more parchment,</font></font>

21:01.720 --> 21:06.830
but this-this definitely stands out as unnatural.</font></font>

21:06.830 --> 21:09.600
Narrator: In 1897,</font></font>

21:09.600 --> 21:12.539
after penetrating what they believed to be</font></font>

21:12.539 --> 21:16.710
a dome wood seven feet in height during a drilling operation,</font></font>

21:16.710 --> 21:19.740
Treasure Hunters William Chappell and Frederick Blair</font></font>

21:19.740 --> 21:22.660
They were surprised to see not only traces of gold</font></font>

21:22.660 --> 21:23.910
in a drill</font></font>

21:23.910 --> 21:26.600
but also a small piece of parchment</font></font>

21:26.600 --> 21:29.750
with clearly visible letters VI.</font></font>

21:29.750 --> 21:33.080
This discovery led to a series of fascinating theories</font></font>

21:33.080 --> 21:36.770
who suggested that the treasure of Oak Island could be composed</font></font>

21:36.770 --> 21:40.510
more of great monetary value objects.</font></font>

21:40.510 --> 21:43.140
Some believe that the safe can contain all</font></font>

21:43.140 --> 21:45.840
of the lost manuscripts of William Shakespeare</font></font>

21:45.840 --> 21:48.600
the important historical documents,</font></font>

21:48.600 --> 21:50.669
documents that could connect directly</font></font>

21:50.669 --> 21:53.130
the mystery of Oak Island for history</font></font>

21:53.130 --> 21:54.980
of the Knights Templar.</font></font>

21:54.980 --> 21:57.100
CHARLES: Let's put it in a bag.</font></font>

21:57.100 --> 21:58.170
Keep this certainly separate.</font></font>

21:58.170 --> 22:02.850
Let's show the guys. </font>-OK. </font>Right.</font></font>

22:02.850 --> 22:06.039
Because I think they'll be happy to hear</font></font>

22:06.039 --> 22:08.240
we found something that is out of place.</font></font>

22:08.240 --> 22:09.860
I think this is more parchment,</font></font>

22:09.860 --> 22:13.530
but it is a good indication that once we have the plug removed,</font></font>

22:13.530 --> 22:15.360
we will start to find all things</font></font>

22:15.360 --> 22:17.201
we thought we were going to meet last year in H-8.</font></font>

22:17.201 --> 22:18.370
I hope you're right, Jack.</font></font>

22:18.370 --> 22:23.610
(Laughs) I think I am, Charles.</font></font>

22:23.610 --> 22:27.679
No, Rick.</font></font>

22:27.679 --> 22:29.320
Look what Charles and I just found.</font></font>

22:29.320 --> 22:30.799
What is it?</font></font>

22:30.799 --> 22:33.150
JACK: It could be the leather. </font>CHARLES: It could be the leather.</font></font>

22:33.150 --> 22:36.010
But it is definitely-organic material,</font></font>

22:36.010 --> 22:38.929
because you can see the fibers.</font></font>

22:38.929 --> 22:41.429
This was in both the leather and parchment last year.</font></font>

22:41.429 --> 22:42.440
This is what I was finding</font></font>

22:42.440 --> 22:43.440
-em H-8. </font>-Sim.</font></font>

22:43.440 --> 22:45.520
Yes, this needs to be bagged.</font></font>

22:45.520 --> 22:46.520
-Absolutely. </font>-Yes.</font></font>

22:46.520 --> 22:48.160
Arriving. </font>Look out, boys.</font></font>

22:48.160 --> 22:51.169
RICK: The good news scenario</font></font>

22:51.169 --> 22:53.309
It is this leather can be</font></font>

22:53.309 --> 22:57.000
and / or parchment, and it is deep in the Money Pit.</font></font>

22:57.000 --> 23:00.250
And and maybe at some point there may be better news,</font></font>

23:00.250 --> 23:03.150
that is, if we can recover something more substantial</font></font>

23:03.150 --> 23:04.590
than just a little.</font></font>

23:04.590 --> 23:06.910
I mean, the whole ... this whole thing</font></font>

23:06.910 --> 23:10.110
It is about finding an irrefutable piece of evidence.</font></font>

23:10.110 --> 23:11.419
Evidence is evidence.</font></font>

23:11.419 --> 23:14.039
-Yes. </font>-Then more power to you.</font></font>

23:14.039 --> 23:16.220
It's a great find. </font>-Thank you.</font></font>

23:16.220 --> 23:25.860
Alright, let's get back to work, Rick.</font></font>

23:25.860 --> 23:29.910
OK.

23:29.910 --> 23:38.010
Looks good.</font></font>

23:38.010 --> 23:41.160
I think that pretty much does.</font></font>

23:41.160 --> 23:49.820
EH:. </font>Oh, boy.</font></font>

23:49.820 --> 23:55.590
'You have to look at everything. </font>-Yes.</font></font>

23:55.590 --> 23:56.590
Wait.</font></font>

23:56.590 --> 23:57.590
Is this some kind of paper. </font>I do not know if it's old.</font></font>

23:57.590 --> 23:58.590
DAN H:. It is genuine paper.</font></font>

23:58.590 --> 24:00.090
It could be parchment, but it's really fragile.</font></font>

24:00.090 --> 24:01.559
Without the writing, anyway.</font></font>

24:01.559 --> 24:03.290
Not that I can discern.</font></font>

24:03.290 --> 24:05.450
DAN H:. Different colors?</font></font>

24:05.450 --> 24:06.970
A color different from the other side?</font></font>

24:06.970 --> 24:08.450
JACK: Yes.</font></font>

24:08.450 --> 24:12.280
All right, well, let's bag him.</font></font>

24:12.280 --> 24:14.900
I really can not say whether or parchment paper</font></font>

24:14.900 --> 24:18.080
or whether it is old or new, but ...</font></font>

24:18.080 --> 24:19.730
worth saving.</font></font>

24:19.730 --> 24:24.909
GARY: You never know. </font>Good eye, Jack.</font></font>

24:24.909 --> 24:27.650
NARRATOR: Later that day,</font></font>

24:27.650 --> 24:30.460
Craig Tester and his stepson Jack Begley</font></font>

24:30.460 --> 24:33.990
join historians island Paul Troutman and Doug Crowell</font></font>

24:33.990 --> 24:35.919
Research in Oak Island Center</font></font>

24:35.919 --> 24:38.610
to get a closer look at their recent discoveries</font></font>

24:38.610 --> 24:40.950
from H-8 axis.</font></font>

24:40.950 --> 24:43.060
We brought along a couple of things</font></font>

24:43.060 --> 24:46.429
we had found in H-8, uh, we spoke.</font></font>

24:46.429 --> 24:47.690
Let's go ahead and and get it</font></font>

24:47.690 --> 24:50.789
-underneath the uh microscope. </font>-Yes.</font></font>

24:50.789 --> 24:53.000
DOUG: These samples are all from</font></font>

24:53.000 --> 24:56.400
-than the level of 160 feet? </font>JACK: Yes.</font></font>

24:56.400 --> 24:58.900
CRAIG: The first item up is leather.</font></font>

24:58.900 --> 24:59.900
OK.

24:59.900 --> 25:02.970
JACK: Or at least we think.</font></font>

25:02.970 --> 25:04.679
PAUL: I think it will be, uh,</font></font>

25:04.679 --> 25:06.890
one to find out if he has any pattern or anything.</font></font>

25:06.890 --> 25:10.100
NARRATOR: Using a digital microscope Grobet,</font></font>

25:10.100 --> 25:12.630
the team will be able to expand the samples</font></font>

25:12.630 --> 25:15.710
up to 2,000 times its actual size.</font></font>

25:15.710 --> 25:17.789
CRAIG: We're seeing a little color there.</font></font>

25:17.789 --> 25:20.880
This is a mineral, or which is a paint of some kind?</font></font>

25:20.880 --> 25:22.780
That's what I've been flipping back and forth</font></font>

25:22.780 --> 25:25.250
in my head, Craig, because it is hard to say.</font></font>

25:25.250 --> 25:28.400
When I collected this material last year from H-8,</font></font>

25:28.400 --> 25:29.990
I was surprised to learn</font></font>

25:29.990 --> 25:33.080
it was really leather or binding.</font></font>

25:33.080 --> 25:34.530
CRAIG: That, to me,</font></font>

25:34.530 --> 25:36.040
really it looks like leather.</font></font>

25:36.040 --> 25:38.030
DOUG: Another one for the experts.</font></font>

25:38.030 --> 25:39.450
CRAIG: Yes, definitely.</font></font>

25:39.450 --> 25:41.320
Okay, now let's go with</font></font>

25:41.320 --> 25:43.070
the potential pieces of parchment.</font></font>

25:43.070 --> 25:47.520
DOUG: Oh, look where it is folded.</font></font>

25:47.520 --> 25:49.150
This looks a lot like the parchment.</font></font>

25:49.150 --> 25:53.620
Oh, now, that's interesting. </font>Look for the red.</font></font>

25:53.620 --> 25:55.270
JACK: Yeah, what is that stuff there?</font></font>

25:55.270 --> 25:57.220
-Craig: The colored material? </font>-Yes. </font>Pigment?</font></font>

25:57.220 --> 25:59.820
DOUG: Yes, something has been applied to it.</font></font>

25:59.820 --> 26:04.450
JACK: You have yellow, and you have this pink line.</font></font>

26:04.450 --> 26:06.549
I mean, maybe there was something</font></font>

26:06.549 --> 26:08.100
written on this piece of paper.</font></font>

26:08.100 --> 26:11.770
DOUG: See, I think it really intriguing because ...</font></font>

26:11.770 --> 26:13.330
I can imagine the color to use</font></font>

26:13.330 --> 26:15.159
-in really old books. </font>-Craig: Okay.</font></font>

26:15.159 --> 26:16.850
DOUG: You know how when they started</font></font>

26:16.850 --> 26:18.331
paragraph, usually it was ...</font></font>

26:18.331 --> 26:19.331
It was a great letter,</font></font>

26:19.331 --> 26:20.950
-and would be in color? </font>-Mm-hmm.</font></font>

26:20.950 --> 26:24.059
That's what it reminds me.</font></font>

26:24.059 --> 26:26.870
Narrator: In the early fifth century AD,</font></font>

26:26.870 --> 26:31.460
a large, stylized initial known as a drop cap</font></font>

26:31.460 --> 26:34.070
It is sometimes used to adorn the first letter</font></font>

26:34.070 --> 26:37.049
in each paragraph or chapter of manuscripts</font></font>

26:37.049 --> 26:39.830
written across Europe and the Middle East.</font></font>

26:39.830 --> 26:42.370
But what makes new team's findings</font></font>

26:42.370 --> 26:44.750
further potentially significant</font></font>

26:44.750 --> 26:47.620
is the fact that such decorative characters</font></font>

26:47.620 --> 26:50.480
They were most commonly found in religious texts</font></font>

26:50.480 --> 26:52.220
and important documents</font></font>

26:52.220 --> 26:54.640
often illustrated with artwork prepared.</font></font>

26:54.640 --> 26:56.960
DOUG: Look how straight it is.</font></font>

26:56.960 --> 26:59.430
It does not run all the time.</font></font>

26:59.430 --> 27:01.110
Yes, it stops abruptly.</font></font>

27:01.110 --> 27:02.809
CRAIG: Let me turn it over</font></font>

27:02.809 --> 27:06.350
in case you get a different look from this side.</font></font>

27:06.350 --> 27:08.000
JACK: Oh look.</font></font>

27:08.000 --> 27:11.049
You have really fibrous material,</font></font>

27:11.049 --> 27:12.809
like here,</font></font>

27:12.809 --> 27:14.440
but then this seems a lot smoother.</font></font>

27:14.440 --> 27:17.160
As the fibers are only on the opposite side,</font></font>

27:17.160 --> 27:18.280
Not this side.</font></font>

27:18.280 --> 27:21.550
That's really intriguing. </font>-Craig: Yes, it is.</font></font>

27:21.550 --> 27:23.651
Yes, definitely you need to have a look expert at it.</font></font>

27:23.651 --> 27:27.210
Whether it's paper ... What kind of role?</font></font>

27:27.210 --> 27:31.130
And I really think that they can do things with these pigments.</font></font>

27:31.130 --> 27:33.059
When determining which are the pigments that are,</font></font>

27:33.059 --> 27:34.669
they can determine periods of time,</font></font>

27:34.669 --> 27:35.669
-so ... -Paul: Yes, discover</font></font>

27:35.669 --> 27:38.060
or the like is not as</font></font>

27:38.060 --> 27:40.169
-for the first sample. </font>-Yes.</font></font>

27:40.169 --> 27:41.870
CRAIG: Thanks, guys.</font></font>

27:41.870 --> 27:46.190
We'll be back with more.</font></font>

27:46.190 --> 27:52.390
NARRATOR: It is the beginning of a new day in Oak Island.</font></font>

27:52.390 --> 27:54.740
MARTY: Come on, baby!

27:54.740 --> 27:57.679
NARRATOR: As brothers Rick and Marty Lagina,</font></font>

27:57.679 --> 28:01.549
your partner Craig Tester, and other members of your team</font></font>

28:01.549 --> 28:04.409
continuing excavation axis H-8</font></font>

28:04.409 --> 28:05.590
in Money Pit area ...</font></font>

28:05.590 --> 28:07.690
DAVE: Nothing.</font></font>

28:07.690 --> 28:11.890
Nothing to hold on.</font></font>

28:11.890 --> 28:12.940
Yes.</font></font>

28:12.940 --> 28:15.070
... Today also marks the return</font></font>

28:15.070 --> 28:16.940
a special guest to the island.</font></font>

28:16.940 --> 28:19.740
It seems that the guys are here.</font></font>

28:19.740 --> 28:22.000
There he is. </font>Hey, Randall.</font></font>

28:22.000 --> 28:23.360
Hey you.</font></font>

28:23.360 --> 28:26.220
Narrator: For the past two decades,</font></font>

28:26.220 --> 28:29.480
investigative journalist and author Randall Sullivan</font></font>

28:29.480 --> 28:30.490
has been researching</font></font>

28:30.490 --> 28:33.450
and write about the mystery of Oak Island.</font></font>

28:33.450 --> 28:35.540
It is this research that resulted</font></font>

28:35.540 --> 28:38.100
at the conclusion of a brand new book sheet</font></font>

28:38.100 --> 28:45.030
on the treasure hunt 223 years.</font></font>

28:45.030 --> 28:47.500
I look forward to reading your book.</font></font>

28:47.500 --> 28:49.960
That would be good.</font></font>

28:49.960 --> 28:56.200
Thus, his book has now come to fruition.</font></font>

28:56.200 --> 28:58.160
-You guys are getting the first copy.</font></font>

28:58.160 --> 28:59.160
-All right!</font></font>

28:59.160 --> 29:00.160
And you changed your thinking</font></font>

29:00.160 --> 29:04.940
about what and when and what and where?</font></font>

29:04.940 --> 29:08.360
Well, the things I was interested in</font></font>

29:08.360 --> 29:10.330
actually became more convincing to me.</font></font>

29:10.330 --> 29:11.770
-Same? </font>-RANDALL: I just found out</font></font>

29:11.770 --> 29:13.560
So much history, so much truth.</font></font>

29:13.560 --> 29:14.919
But pointing here?</font></font>

29:14.919 --> 29:16.060
He points here.</font></font>

29:16.060 --> 29:20.290
Well, we are deeply interested in learning more about it.</font></font>

29:20.290 --> 29:22.180
Let's have a little powwow in the war room.</font></font>

29:22.180 --> 29:23.180
Okay, great.</font></font>

29:23.180 --> 29:24.529
-I have a chance to give you the books.</font></font>

29:24.529 --> 29:25.529
Yes, welcome back.</font></font>

29:25.529 --> 29:26.529
-Welcome back. </font>-Welcome back.</font></font>

29:26.529 --> 29:27.529
MARTY: We know Randall Sullivan</font></font>

29:27.529 --> 29:29.590
It is a good researcher and a great writer.</font></font>

29:29.590 --> 29:31.790
RICK: Not only he wrote another book</font></font>

29:31.790 --> 29:34.529
Oak Island, but he has done a very adequate job</font></font>

29:34.529 --> 29:37.110
research on the mystery of Oak Island</font></font>

29:37.110 --> 29:40.450
and before the story of the discovery.</font></font>

29:40.450 --> 29:42.169
The hope is that some of the material</font></font>

29:42.169 --> 29:44.780
will-will help us or help us</font></font>

29:44.780 --> 29:47.190
as we move forward with our research.</font></font>

29:47.190 --> 29:49.760
So I see some books here,</font></font>

29:49.760 --> 29:51.330
-Mr. </font>Sullivan. </font>Uh, you do. </font>The first two ...</font></font>

29:51.330 --> 29:53.720
-first two copies. </font>-Oh thank you very much.</font></font>

29:53.720 --> 29:56.660
MARTY: It's fantastic. </font>Signed, II take it?</font></font>

29:56.660 --> 29:58.340
-Clear. </font>-Clear.</font></font>

29:58.340 --> 30:00.480
This is probably how it looks, you know.</font></font>

30:00.480 --> 30:01.480
(Randall ri)

30:01.480 --> 30:03.419
That's what we'll find out right there.</font></font>

30:03.419 --> 30:05.550
Yes, there is ... there is much more underground.</font></font>

30:05.550 --> 30:06.770
-Mm-hmm. </font>Marty: Yes.</font></font>

30:06.770 --> 30:09.270
-There is no doubt about it. </font>-Yes.</font></font>

30:09.270 --> 30:11.730
MARTY: Are you happy with that?</font></font>

30:11.730 --> 30:13.820
Of course I'm happy about it. </font>I mean, when I ...</font></font>

30:13.820 --> 30:16.420
You know, II think it's certainly the most authoritative</font></font>

30:16.420 --> 30:19.409
and entertaining story of Oak Island.</font></font>

30:19.409 --> 30:21.670
What I discovered, to my surprise, really,</font></font>

30:21.670 --> 30:23.640
confirmed both the origin story.</font></font>

30:23.640 --> 30:25.419
I believe the fundamental story origin,</font></font>

30:25.419 --> 30:28.320
Pit the money was found for three teenagers--</font></font>

30:28.320 --> 30:30.340
John Smith, Anthony Vaughan

30:30.340 --> 30:33.179
-and Daniel McGinnis ... Okay.</font></font>

30:33.179 --> 30:35.180
I think it's verifiable, actually.</font></font>

30:35.180 --> 30:37.360
there plausibility</font></font>

30:37.360 --> 30:40.030
in totally misunderstood anything happened here?</font></font>

30:40.030 --> 30:41.650
-Not for me. </font>-Not.</font></font>

30:41.650 --> 30:43.300
I am pleased that the story of origin</font></font>

30:43.300 --> 30:45.830
-is fundamentally accurate. </font>All right, continue.</font></font>

30:45.830 --> 30:46.960
-Mm-hmm. </font>-E am, I am also ...</font></font>

30:46.960 --> 30:49.350
You know, that led to exploration</font></font>

30:49.350 --> 30:50.650
of the first stories of the research,</font></font>

30:50.650 --> 30:53.510
which of course leads to, you know, 90 Stone foot</font></font>

30:53.510 --> 30:55.090
and the initial flood.</font></font>

30:55.090 --> 30:56.190
-Mm-hmm. </font>-Yes.</font></font>

30:56.190 --> 30:58.530
MARTY: Where you move away from the lore,</font></font>

30:58.530 --> 31:00.130
or not? </font>So basically,</font></font>

31:00.130 --> 31:02.600
you are saying that the flood tunnels, drains the box ...</font></font>

31:02.600 --> 31:04.740
II think it's clear that that, uh,</font></font>

31:04.740 --> 31:07.200
Truro Company did find these things</font></font>

31:07.200 --> 31:08.350
when they went to explore the beach</font></font>

31:08.350 --> 31:11.260
-and they were crushed by them. </font>-Mm-hmm.</font></font>

31:11.260 --> 31:13.371
What is the most compelling piece of evidence for you?</font></font>

31:13.371 --> 31:16.990
I mean, can you can highlight</font></font>

31:16.990 --> 31:18.909
single most compelling piece of evidence?</font></font>

31:18.909 --> 31:20.899
I mean, it all works</font></font>

31:20.899 --> 31:23.140
It is the most compelling piece of evidence.</font></font>

31:23.140 --> 31:24.480
I mean, something ...</font></font>

31:24.480 --> 31:27.870
Whatever was done it was done on a scale which required</font></font>

31:27.870 --> 31:31.179
a job and a commitment that I have always had a hard time</font></font>

31:31.179 --> 31:34.480
believing that people do it just for a golden treasure.</font></font>

31:34.480 --> 31:35.480
Mm-hmm.

31:35.480 --> 31:36.760
No matter how big it was.</font></font>

31:36.760 --> 31:38.909
And when I started to look for theories</font></font>

31:38.909 --> 31:40.460
coming from this side</font></font>

31:40.460 --> 31:42.640
and the historical facts that support them,</font></font>

31:42.640 --> 31:45.809
that's why I was so attracted by Francis Bacon.</font></font>

31:45.809 --> 31:46.809
Mm-hmm.

31:46.809 --> 31:48.059
(Bird cries)</font></font>

31:48.059 --> 31:49.660
NARRATOR: Of the many theories</font></font>

31:49.660 --> 31:51.890
Oak Island,</font></font>

31:51.890 --> 31:53.919
one of the most compelling suggests</font></font>

31:53.919 --> 31:56.020
the man behind the mystery</font></font>

31:56.020 --> 31:58.809
was none other than Sir Francis Bacon,</font></font>

31:58.809 --> 32:01.740
the renowned philosopher of the 17th century,</font></font>

32:01.740 --> 32:04.460
scientist and noble.</font></font>

32:04.460 --> 32:06.130
Some researchers even believe</font></font>

32:06.130 --> 32:07.981
Bacon came to Oak Island</font></font>

32:07.981 --> 32:11.120
with original manuscripts of William Shakespeare</font></font>

32:11.120 --> 32:15.190
and buried them in a filled with mercury lead box.</font></font>

32:15.190 --> 32:18.150
RANDALL: Bacon was inheriting one ...</font></font>

32:18.150 --> 32:20.870
a wisdom, a tradition that went back,</font></font>

32:20.870 --> 32:23.900
you know, even deeper than the times of the Knights Templar.</font></font>

32:23.900 --> 32:25.039
-Mm-hmm. </font>-There are very</font></font>

32:25.039 --> 32:27.420
Historical evidence that supports it.</font></font>

32:27.420 --> 32:28.630
I mean, not-not that it proves that</font></font>

32:28.630 --> 32:30.930
or sets it for sure,</font></font>

32:30.930 --> 32:33.370
but increases its plausibility,</font></font>

32:33.370 --> 32:35.010
because Bacon wrote that</font></font>

32:35.010 --> 32:37.220
one of the best ways to educate people</font></font>

32:37.220 --> 32:38.870
It is to create a treasure hunt.</font></font>

32:38.870 --> 32:40.690
MARTY: Oh, really?</font></font>

32:40.690 --> 32:42.330
- (laughter) -This ... this SOB</font></font>

32:42.330 --> 32:43.330
This is quite convincing.</font></font>

32:43.330 --> 32:45.440
MARTY: Well, if he is the architect of this,</font></font>

32:45.440 --> 32:46.909
then the man, did he hit the bull's eye</font></font>

32:46.909 --> 32:48.429
-With this. </font>-Yes.</font></font>

32:48.429 --> 32:50.720
You may know this, Rick, that that ...</font></font>

32:50.720 --> 32:53.169
one of the works of Bacon, uh, uh,</font></font>

32:53.169 --> 32:55.320
It is about creating a perpetual spring.</font></font>

32:55.320 --> 32:56.960
-Mm-hmm. </font>Yes, and the first line of</font></font>

32:56.960 --> 32:58.419
their instructions is:</font></font>

32:58.419 --> 33:00.149
"Dig a hole in the sea."</font></font>

33:00.149 --> 33:03.830
NARRATOR: Shortly after the death</font></font>

33:03.830 --> 33:07.049
Sir Francis Bacon in 1626,</font></font>

33:07.049 --> 33:10.190
his personal secretary, William Rawley,</font></font>

33:10.190 --> 33:13.559
published a collection of philosophical writings of Bacon</font></font>

33:13.559 --> 33:15.760
tided forest growing.</font></font>

33:15.760 --> 33:20.700
Among the nearly 1,000 passages in the text,</font></font>

33:20.700 --> 33:22.310
one instructs the reader</font></font>

33:22.310 --> 33:24.980
to "dig a hole on the seashore"</font></font>

33:24.980 --> 33:27.110
starting above the high water mark,</font></font>

33:27.110 --> 33:30.330
and then to sink the axis to a point below the sea level.</font></font>

33:30.330 --> 33:34.190
Will Randall Sullivan discovered evidence</font></font>

33:34.190 --> 33:35.880
with his hand to Bacon</font></font>

33:35.880 --> 33:38.840
referring to the construction of the Pit money?</font></font>

33:38.840 --> 33:43.149
RANDALL: There were lines like that I thought</font></font>

33:43.149 --> 33:46.940
this is just too much of a coincidence to be a coincidence.</font></font>

33:46.940 --> 33:48.080
Right.</font></font>

33:48.080 --> 33:50.640
RICK: If you woke up tomorrow morning</font></font>

33:50.640 --> 33:54.210
and you were in charge, but you just had a swing,</font></font>

33:54.210 --> 33:57.680
where you look and what you do ... how do you do it?</font></font>

33:57.680 --> 34:01.860
Oh. </font>-A swing at bat.</font></font>

34:01.860 --> 34:05.309
Well, I would look for an entry</font></font>

34:05.309 --> 34:09.020
which is now underwater.</font></font>

34:09.020 --> 34:10.728
Wow.</font></font>

34:10.728 --> 34:12.440
Underwater?</font></font>

34:12.440 --> 34:16.649
Could Randall Sullivan made a direct connection</font></font>

34:16.649 --> 34:20.869
between the solution to the mystery of Oak Island</font></font>

34:20.869 --> 34:23.909
and recent team discovered in Smith's Cove?</font></font>

34:23.909 --> 34:25.369
RICK: Randall Sullivan

34:25.369 --> 34:28.839
is an advocate of Baconian connection to Oak Island,</font></font>

34:28.839 --> 34:30.750
I'd rather like me.</font></font>

34:30.750 --> 34:33.040
That fits with what we're digging here</font></font>

34:33.040 --> 34:37.079
in Smith Creek, so it's really very interesting.</font></font>

34:37.079 --> 34:40.540
RANDALL: I am, I am sure that the actual origins</font></font>

34:40.540 --> 34:42.719
flood tunnel is, you know, way offshore.</font></font>

34:42.719 --> 34:46.399
-Not the primary flood system. </font>-Mm-hmm.</font></font>

34:46.399 --> 34:51.139
You know, on the south side. </font>Not in Smith Cove.</font></font>

34:51.139 --> 34:54.069
NARRATOR: Another flood tunnel system</font></font>

34:54.069 --> 34:57.160
on the south coast?</font></font>

34:57.160 --> 34:59.720
In winter 1980, while conducting</font></font>

34:59.720 --> 35:02.380
a pumping operation in the Money Pit,</font></font>

35:02.380 --> 35:05.359
Hunter veteran treasure Dan Blankenship</font></font>

35:05.359 --> 35:08.049
noticed four large holes in the frozen bay</font></font>

35:08.049 --> 35:11.589
off shore south of the island.</font></font>

35:11.589 --> 35:14.820
It was his belief that the so-called "ice holes"</font></font>

35:14.820 --> 35:17.630
that appeared again in 1987,</font></font>

35:17.630 --> 35:20.479
It may be evidence of a second flood tunnel</font></font>

35:20.479 --> 35:22.739
feeding water from the ocean to the Money Pit.</font></font>

35:22.739 --> 35:24.459
Could it be that,</font></font>

35:24.459 --> 35:27.049
in order to recover the treasure of Oak Island,</font></font>

35:27.049 --> 35:29.109
the team must turn off not one,</font></font>

35:29.109 --> 35:32.569
but the bomb multiple systems flood?</font></font>

35:32.569 --> 35:34.599
RICK: Is there a possibility</font></font>

35:34.599 --> 35:36.650
that there is an associated tunnel</font></font>

35:36.650 --> 35:40.709
to the south coast, right next to the stone triangle.</font></font>

35:40.709 --> 35:43.953
Therefore, it is interesting because it is in an area</font></font>

35:43.953 --> 35:46.759
we know very little about.</font></font>

35:46.759 --> 35:47.789
It is worth investigating.</font></font>

35:47.789 --> 35:51.270
I know you have real work to do.</font></font>

35:51.270 --> 35:52.270
MARTY: Yeah, we have things to do.</font></font>

35:52.270 --> 35:53.270
RANDALL: You have to get, you know,</font></font>

35:53.270 --> 35:54.900
working, you know, the updated version</font></font>

35:54.900 --> 35:56.470
-which will inevitably come. </font>-That's right.</font></font>

35:56.470 --> 35:57.769
That's right. </font>We have to get her some material.</font></font>

35:57.769 --> 35:58.769
That's right.</font></font>

35:58.769 --> 36:01.599
I have a book to read. </font>-You-you do indeed.</font></font>

36:01.599 --> 36:05.319
MARTY: Let's go back to it.</font></font>

36:05.319 --> 36:11.749
Narrator: After his briefing</font></font>

36:11.749 --> 36:15.219
in the war room, Rick, and Marty Craig</font></font>

36:15.219 --> 36:17.249
return to the site of the Pit money,</font></font>

36:17.249 --> 36:20.309
where Jack Begley, Charles Barkhouse</font></font>

36:20.309 --> 36:24.410
and Dan Henskee continue to scour the spoils</font></font>

36:24.410 --> 36:27.019
for potential clues dug from the axis H-8.</font></font>

36:27.019 --> 36:28.019
CRAIG: What's the word?</font></font>

36:28.019 --> 36:29.059
Well, gravity did its thing.</font></font>

36:29.059 --> 36:30.059
How many?</font></font>

36:30.059 --> 36:31.059
-24 feet. </font>-Same?</font></font>

36:31.059 --> 36:32.059
-Wow. </font>Yeah, so, of course,</font></font>

36:32.059 --> 36:37.609
-type came was eight feet. </font>-Right.</font></font>

36:37.609 --> 36:40.800
And then, as we brought the can,</font></font>

36:40.800 --> 36:44.450
who won another 16, so we are 24 feet fit in the can.</font></font>

36:44.450 --> 36:47.459
-All right. </font>We will continue to dig. </font>-Yes.</font></font>

36:47.459 --> 36:50.180
RICK: If this material disappeared</font></font>

36:50.180 --> 36:52.369
reveals inspiring something that says,</font></font>

36:52.369 --> 36:54.509
you need to get here and look,</font></font>

36:54.509 --> 36:57.239
then the game is actually happening because then we go down,</font></font>

36:57.239 --> 37:01.789
and retrieve what's down there.</font></font>

37:01.789 --> 37:06.109
Oh, look what we have here.</font></font>

37:06.109 --> 37:07.459
I think it's ... it seems like a lot</font></font>

37:07.459 --> 37:10.109
like parchment, except it's black.</font></font>

37:10.109 --> 37:11.109
It's very, very dark.</font></font>

37:11.109 --> 37:12.400
CHARLES: It could be.</font></font>

37:12.400 --> 37:14.150
NARRATOR: Another piece of parchment?</font></font>

37:14.150 --> 37:16.229
this could be further evidence</font></font>

37:16.229 --> 37:18.999
that books and old documents are part</font></font>

37:18.999 --> 37:20.089
Treasure Oak Island?</font></font>

37:20.089 --> 37:21.198
I'm going to sack him, Jack. </font>Yes, we need to save it.</font></font>

37:21.198 --> 37:22.198
-Yes. </font>-Just in case.</font></font>

37:22.198 --> 37:27.650
Oh, here's a nice little ... Yeah!</font></font>

37:27.650 --> 37:32.069
What do you think of that?</font></font>

37:32.069 --> 37:34.029
It has all kinds of grains.</font></font>

37:34.029 --> 37:35.869
He might look like, uh,</font></font>

37:35.869 --> 37:37.489
something in a human body or ...</font></font>

37:37.489 --> 37:42.839
Oh, you think this could be a bone?</font></font>

37:42.839 --> 37:45.519
NARRATOR: Bone?</font></font>

37:45.519 --> 37:47.069
the team could have found more evidence</font></font>

37:47.069 --> 37:50.599
of human remains buried in Pit money fund?</font></font>

37:50.599 --> 37:52.859
And if so, could be related</font></font>

37:52.859 --> 37:56.079
one of two individuals of the 17th century</font></font>

37:56.079 --> 38:00.589
whose bones were discovered in the same place last year?</font></font>

38:00.589 --> 38:02.869
Or it could be the remains</font></font>

38:02.869 --> 38:06.960
another person, yet to be identified?</font></font>

38:06.960 --> 38:08.170
It is porous.</font></font>

38:08.170 --> 38:11.390
Yes, to have someone who, you know, know more than us</font></font>

38:11.390 --> 38:12.730
have a look at it.</font></font>

38:12.730 --> 38:15.150
This really is a good find, Dan.</font></font>

38:15.150 --> 38:17.969
JACK: Some of the important things</font></font>

38:17.969 --> 38:20.640
that came out of the H-8 remains far</font></font>

38:20.640 --> 38:22.610
They were the scroll, and then, a bone</font></font>

38:22.610 --> 38:24.670
which seemed kind of strange.</font></font>

38:24.670 --> 38:26.690
AquecÃª it, Dan!</font></font>

38:26.690 --> 38:31.390
We should be able to get some information back from that</font></font>

38:31.390 --> 38:32.410
and some understanding</font></font>

38:32.410 --> 38:35.670
why these bones are so deep within the earth.</font></font>

38:35.670 --> 38:38.900
-Hi guys. </font>-Hi. </font>How's it going?</font></font>

38:38.900 --> 38:41.739
-Whew! </font>CHARLES: Found a few</font></font>

38:41.739 --> 38:43.759
-interesting things. </font>-Seriously?</font></font>

38:43.759 --> 38:47.289
Jack thinks he may have found a piece of bone.</font></font>

38:47.289 --> 38:51.160
Given the grooves on the back here,</font></font>

38:51.160 --> 38:53.869
I do not know, or was against</font></font>

38:53.869 --> 38:56.359
a piece of wood? </font>I'm not sure.</font></font>

38:56.359 --> 38:59.479
CRAIG: It seems almost twisted, though.</font></font>

38:59.479 --> 39:00.519
CHARLES: Yeah.

39:00.519 --> 39:01.519
Not sure what that is.</font></font>

39:01.519 --> 39:02.519
JACK: What do you think?</font></font>

39:02.519 --> 39:03.680
Well, we can take a picture of it</font></font>

39:03.680 --> 39:05.519
-and send it to Laird. </font>-Yes.</font></font>

39:05.519 --> 39:08.130
I do not know what to think of this one, it is ...</font></font>

39:08.130 --> 39:10.849
bone or wood or twisted. </font>It's strange appearance.</font></font>

39:10.849 --> 39:13.671
-Yes. </font>JACK: The more I look at it,</font></font>

39:13.671 --> 39:15.650
I think it's more bone because,</font></font>

39:15.650 --> 39:19.589
I mean, if you look at the hollow center,</font></font>

39:19.589 --> 39:22.049
it seems that this is where the bone marrow should be.</font></font>

39:22.049 --> 39:24.779
If it is bone, which is really good news,</font></font>

39:24.779 --> 39:27.719
Because then we have a third piece of bone to test.</font></font>

39:27.719 --> 39:29.079
It may be a different individual,</font></font>

39:29.079 --> 39:30.599
and we can better identify</font></font>

39:30.599 --> 39:33.729
a period of time and where they came from.</font></font>

39:33.729 --> 39:37.539
This will help determine who was potentially here, so ...</font></font>

39:37.539 --> 39:41.279
-Yes. </font>Exciting. </font>Okay, well, that sounds good.</font></font>

39:41.279 --> 39:42.279
Exciting.</font></font>

39:42.279 --> 39:45.170
At least we know the oddities found last year</font></font>

39:45.170 --> 39:48.339
H-8 were not just from this hole.</font></font>

39:48.339 --> 39:49.960
There's more stuff down there,</font></font>

39:49.960 --> 39:51.769
and hope to find more.</font></font>

39:51.769 --> 39:54.239
You know, the more we go through the spoils,</font></font>

39:54.239 --> 39:55.950
the more things that will come up.</font></font>

39:55.950 --> 39:57.190
-Absolutely. </font>-There's something</font></font>

39:57.190 --> 39:59.059
there in the Money Pit, Rick.</font></font>

39:59.059 --> 40:01.829
II know it. </font>Look, it's not about</font></font>

40:01.829 --> 40:03.309
-right or wrong. </font>It's not ... No, no.</font></font>

40:03.309 --> 40:05.199
It's about the search for truth.</font></font>

40:05.199 --> 40:07.130
-Do you know? </font>-Yes.</font></font>

40:07.130 --> 40:08.130
But we are finding interesting clues.</font></font>

40:08.130 --> 40:09.869
We are trying to apply real science</font></font>

40:09.869 --> 40:12.410
a real mystery with real business acumen.</font></font>

40:12.410 --> 40:14.640
CHARLES: Yeah. </font>'So the hope is,</font></font>

40:14.640 --> 40:17.499
as this year progresses, we will find the only thing.</font></font>

40:17.499 --> 40:20.170
That's my hope.</font></font>

40:20.170 --> 40:21.949
CHARLES: Yep.

40:21.949 --> 40:25.329
Narrator: For Laginas and its partners,</font></font>

40:25.329 --> 40:28.259
the idea that something of historical importance</font></font>

40:28.259 --> 40:31.930
happened at Oak Island is no longer a question.</font></font>

40:31.930 --> 40:35.910
But as they continue to dig in Smith's Cove,</font></font>

40:35.910 --> 40:38.369
the Money Pit,</font></font>

40:38.369 --> 40:41.150
and other areas across the island,</font></font>

40:41.150 --> 40:43.449
what will they find?</font></font>

40:43.449 --> 40:46.329
historical manuscripts invaluable?</font></font>

40:46.329 --> 40:48.579
Gold and silver left here by the Knights Templar?</font></font>

40:48.579 --> 40:53.469
Or will it be something much more valuable?</font></font>

40:53.469 --> 40:54.469
Something so precious,</font></font>

40:54.469 --> 40:59.509
I needed to be saved with human lives?</font></font>

40:59.509 --> 41:04.460
Next time on The Curse of Oak Island ...</font></font>

41:04.460 --> 41:05.859
JACK: We'll find him.</font></font>

41:05.859 --> 41:07.739
-It should be in this area. </font>-Start recording.</font></font>

41:07.739 --> 41:09.660
We're recording. </font>This thing can be done by man.</font></font>

41:09.660 --> 41:11.299
It almost seems an anchor.</font></font>

41:11.299 --> 41:13.059
Tell me what you think it is.</font></font>

41:13.059 --> 41:15.079
DOUG: What was considered valuable enough</font></font>

41:15.079 --> 41:17.390
to bury manuscripts so far underground?</font></font>

41:17.390 --> 41:18.989
This is a medieval book.</font></font>

41:18.989 --> 41:19.989
DANNY: See how the floor is gone?</font></font>

41:19.989 --> 41:20.989
It's caving. </font>He is preparing to tip over.</font></font>

41:20.989 --> 41:24.420
MARTY: This is a very dangerous place.</font></font>

41:24.420 --> 41:26.710
All the money Pit can collapse.</font></font>

41:26.710 --> 41:27.871
RICK: All this work,</font></font>

41:27.871 --> 41:28.871
all the research.</font></font>

41:28.871 --> 41:29.871
MARTY: This is not good.</font></font>

41:29.871 --> 41:30.871
We can not continue.</font></font>
