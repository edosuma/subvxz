03:03.383 --> 03:05.584
Be good for your mom, yeah?

03:52.399 --> 03:54.414
Hope you're day's getting
off to a good start.

03:54.434 --> 03:56.950
It's been nippy but sunny,
here in Dublin anyway.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.385
I didn't recognize myself,

03:58.405 --> 03:59.819
and that's when I
started to become ill.

03:59.839 --> 04:01.621
There are definitely other

04:01.641 --> 04:03.356
in between spaces.

04:03.376 --> 04:04.457
You know, there's this idea...

04:04.477 --> 04:06.459
No matter what time of day,

04:06.479 --> 04:09.663
we're always here for
you, 24 hours...

04:09.683 --> 04:12.032
In the planning, air
regulator would ensure

04:12.052 --> 04:14.734
that we had a planning
system that works

04:14.754 --> 04:17.904
for the communities and
works for the people,

04:17.923 --> 04:20.940
and doesn't just work
for the developers.

04:20.959 --> 04:22.961
It should not be theirs.

09:23.296 --> 09:25.830
Knowledge of Trees.

10:05.738 --> 10:07.172
I know, I know.

10:08.775 --> 10:09.889
You're letting me down.

10:09.909 --> 10:11.190
No, I said it depends.

10:11.210 --> 10:12.425
Well, you're taking liberties.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.827
I have to get this
thesis in by tomorrow.

10:14.847 --> 10:17.330
I had to get an extension
already because of you.

10:17.350 --> 10:21.234
Now hold on, you're getting
valuable experience.

10:21.254 --> 10:24.871
Wednesday at the very
latest, I promise.

10:24.891 --> 10:26.939
It's the second time
you've done this, Olivia.

10:26.959 --> 10:29.075
It's almost impossible for
me to measure an area

10:29.095 --> 10:29.976
this size on my own.

10:29.996 --> 10:31.129
I'll be there.

10:36.969 --> 10:38.418
Well, I better get back to it,

10:38.438 --> 10:40.753
unless you want me
to be even later.

10:40.773 --> 10:42.021
Right.

10:42.041 --> 10:43.856
Bye.

10:43.876 --> 10:44.876
Bye.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.827
So how do you like
your lodgings?

17:27.847 --> 17:30.496
Yeah, fine, peaceful.

17:30.516 --> 17:31.864
Settled in okay?

17:31.884 --> 17:33.532
Yeah, thanks.

17:33.552 --> 17:36.102
Listen, about the wood.

17:36.122 --> 17:38.604
Why have you requested
state department ordinance

17:38.624 --> 17:39.539
of the area?

17:39.559 --> 17:41.440
We want to keep
things quiet for now.

17:41.460 --> 17:44.176
Commercial sensitivity
and all that.

17:44.196 --> 17:45.544
I need to ask you
something else,

17:45.564 --> 17:48.581
and I'd appreciate
a direct answer.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.549
Fire away.

17:50.569 --> 17:53.204
You do own the land, right?

17:54.306 --> 17:55.721
Of course.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.590
Some hopeless
development was planned

17:57.610 --> 17:58.824
at the tail end of the boom.

17:58.844 --> 18:00.493
We got it for a song.

18:00.513 --> 18:04.196
It's perfect, or at
least it seems to be.

18:04.216 --> 18:07.333
It's your job to tell
us that for certain.

18:07.353 --> 18:10.603
I'm not sure you're gonna
get clearance from the EPA.

18:10.623 --> 18:12.905
They won't be a problem.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.507
How can you be so sure?

18:14.527 --> 18:17.243
The system doesn't just
protect the environment.

18:17.263 --> 18:21.432
It also protects those who wish
to exploit the environment.

18:22.868 --> 18:25.217
Is everything okay at your end, Mr.
Mayberry?

18:25.237 --> 18:26.619
Yeah, fine.

18:26.639 --> 18:28.487
You're happy to be working
with us on this one?

18:28.507 --> 18:29.755
Yeah, of course, but...

18:29.775 --> 18:30.775
But what?

18:34.713 --> 18:37.830
I'm curious why you
approached me for the job.

18:37.850 --> 18:39.732
I mean, frankly, we both
know there are larger survey

18:39.752 --> 18:42.735
firms out there better equipped
for a project this size.

18:42.755 --> 18:45.504
Like I said, it's a
commercially sensitive venture.

18:45.524 --> 18:47.640
We don't want the competition
getting wind of us.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.842
If lots of surveyors go
trampling around out there,

18:49.862 --> 18:51.810
the cat's out of the bag.

18:51.830 --> 18:54.280
Besides, Mr. Mayberry.

18:54.300 --> 18:55.300
Besides?

18:56.635 --> 18:59.685
You have a reputation
for discretion.

18:59.705 --> 19:01.187
We'll leave it there.

19:01.207 --> 19:02.473
Keep me posted.

19:10.716 --> 19:11.716
Yeah.

22:49.001 --> 22:50.534
For fuck's sake.

23:22.801 --> 23:23.615
You're certain?

23:23.635 --> 23:26.485
Absolutely, no one
knows a thing.

23:26.505 --> 23:28.921
This is a curious line of
questioning, I must say.

23:28.941 --> 23:31.123
I just considered
environmental activists

23:31.143 --> 23:33.844
or industrial espionage maybe.

23:38.984 --> 23:39.984
It's fine.

23:40.719 --> 23:43.235
I'm sure it's nothing
to worry about.

23:43.255 --> 23:45.103
Just someone mucking around.

23:45.123 --> 23:48.893
I look forward to
getting this concluded.

24:23.929 --> 24:27.598
And your man's sittin'
over the top of it.

24:30.969 --> 24:32.651
What are you having?

24:32.671 --> 24:33.719
An IPA.

24:33.739 --> 24:34.753
We don't have it.

24:34.773 --> 24:37.689
The chemist might, outside.

24:37.709 --> 24:39.157
Right.

24:39.177 --> 24:41.960
Well, I'll just have a
beer, whatever you have.

24:41.980 --> 24:43.295
I see you have rooms here.

24:43.315 --> 24:44.315
Yeah.

24:45.017 --> 24:46.164
Well, are they taken?

24:46.184 --> 24:47.032
No.

24:47.052 --> 24:48.300
Quiet time of year.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.736
Interested yourself?

24:50.756 --> 24:54.039
No, I just, well I
wondered who'd be staying.

24:54.059 --> 24:56.026
Tried to put talk on me?

24:58.864 --> 24:59.678
Yeah, I suppose.

24:59.698 --> 25:01.580
Where are you staying yourself?

25:01.600 --> 25:05.017
I rented a cottage between
here and the gully above.

25:05.037 --> 25:06.885
And what has you here?

25:06.905 --> 25:09.821
Off-season rambler, I'd say.

25:09.841 --> 25:11.141
No, I'm working.

25:12.945 --> 25:13.945
Workin'?

25:14.813 --> 25:17.181
Yeah, well I'm doing a study.

25:18.917 --> 25:20.232
A study?

25:20.252 --> 25:23.769
It's an academic one,
like a thesis really.

25:23.789 --> 25:24.889
What about?

25:25.824 --> 25:27.024
About the area.

25:28.794 --> 25:31.729
What about the
area specifically?

25:33.932 --> 25:35.047
The gully.

25:35.067 --> 25:37.883
Well, the woods in the gully.

25:37.903 --> 25:41.086
The woods in the
gully specifically.

25:41.106 --> 25:42.988
Does that sound specific to you?

25:43.008 --> 25:45.023
Not specifically.

25:51.016 --> 25:54.084
Sounds more like
Devoy's kinda thing.

25:56.154 --> 25:57.154
Devoy?

25:58.156 --> 26:00.639
That's his cottage
you're stayin' in.

26:00.659 --> 26:01.940
Went soft in the head
wandering through

26:01.960 --> 26:06.144
those woods up there
doing unspecific things.

26:06.164 --> 26:10.334
Yeah, well it's an
unspecific kinda place.

26:11.670 --> 26:13.819
How do you mean?

26:13.839 --> 26:17.956
No one ever named it, never
even put it on a map.

26:17.976 --> 26:20.025
It's got a name of sorts.

26:20.045 --> 26:22.094
And what's that?

26:22.114 --> 26:23.114
Gan Ainm.

26:24.149 --> 26:25.030
Gan Ainm?

26:25.050 --> 26:27.633
No name, it means.

26:27.653 --> 26:29.987
Without name, to be precise.

26:31.990 --> 26:34.992
How'd you come
across his cottage?

26:36.995 --> 26:40.145
That was my employer
at the university.

26:40.165 --> 26:42.066
They took care of that.

26:48.040 --> 26:50.989
So how long are you gonna
stay in the cottage?

26:51.009 --> 26:52.357
I'm not really sure.

26:52.377 --> 26:53.759
Hi, mate.

26:53.779 --> 26:57.181
Hello, can I get another
one of these please?

26:58.950 --> 27:00.799
Can I get you something?

27:00.819 --> 27:02.300
I stick with the tea.

27:02.320 --> 27:05.270
Intoxicate myself in other ways.

27:05.290 --> 27:07.673
Yeah, you look like a toker.

27:07.693 --> 27:08.693
Do I?

27:10.295 --> 27:12.911
Psilocybin, actually.

27:12.931 --> 27:15.933
I'll give you a
pint of that then.

27:17.369 --> 27:19.384
So what is it you do?

27:19.404 --> 27:21.171
Oh, whatever I can.

27:23.108 --> 27:23.989
You live around here?

27:24.009 --> 27:27.878
Yep, a stop just above
Gan Ainm actually.

27:28.780 --> 27:30.462
You're in the caravan, right?

27:30.482 --> 27:32.431
Yeah, I recognize this fella.

27:32.451 --> 27:35.133
Chaplin, he's handy.

27:35.153 --> 27:36.034
You shouldn't be
there, you know.

27:36.054 --> 27:39.223
It's all bought up,
private property.

27:40.926 --> 27:42.326
Private property?

27:43.495 --> 27:44.776
Actually, I may have that wrong.

27:44.796 --> 27:46.411
I just heard something.

27:46.431 --> 27:49.347
How did you hear it?

27:49.367 --> 27:52.417
Jesus, I can't remember,
to tell you the truth.

27:52.437 --> 27:54.386
It doesn't matter anyway.

27:54.406 --> 27:57.723
I don't believe in the
concept of private property.

27:57.743 --> 28:00.926
Yeah, that's 'cause
you don't own any.

28:00.946 --> 28:04.181
No one does, they
just think they do.

28:13.759 --> 28:16.374
You always remember to
bring the torch with you?

28:16.394 --> 28:19.244
I wouldn't wanna get lost, man.

28:19.264 --> 28:21.747
There's fairy fields
around here, you know?

28:21.767 --> 28:22.767
Yeah.

28:23.335 --> 28:27.152
They say people don't
get out of them.

28:27.172 --> 28:31.156
They wander forever around
in circles unless...

28:31.176 --> 28:32.342
Unless what?

28:33.545 --> 28:35.927
They turn their
coats inside out,

28:35.947 --> 28:39.264
and that tends to do the
trick for some reason.

28:39.284 --> 28:41.099
Yeah, probably saved
his own life.

28:44.489 --> 28:47.072
So what was the story
with that fellow

28:47.092 --> 28:49.141
who used to live in my place?

28:49.161 --> 28:50.194
Devoy?

28:51.397 --> 28:55.413
They found him in the wood,
half-dead from hypothermia.

28:55.433 --> 28:57.901
Catotonic, completely gone.

28:59.204 --> 29:01.486
He's been in care since.

29:01.506 --> 29:03.874
That's unnerving.

29:05.210 --> 29:07.292
This is you.

29:07.312 --> 29:08.994
Yeah.

29:09.014 --> 29:11.163
Drop in when you're up
around Gan Ainm, yeah?

29:11.183 --> 29:13.198
Might go with you, maybe.

29:13.218 --> 29:14.399
Might be able to help.

29:14.419 --> 29:15.834
Sure.

29:15.854 --> 29:17.469
'Cause for a man doin' a study,

29:17.489 --> 29:20.939
you don't seem to know
much about the place.

29:20.959 --> 29:25.310
Oh, and Eric, 'round here best
to sleep with your pajamas

29:25.330 --> 29:27.179
on inside out, yeah?

29:31.903 --> 29:33.003
Come on, boy.

31:35.226 --> 31:37.542
You annoyed with me?

31:37.562 --> 31:38.977
Why do you say that?

31:38.997 --> 31:42.447
It's obvious, as
you're not talkin'.

31:42.467 --> 31:43.515
No, I'm fine.

31:43.535 --> 31:46.403
I just got a lot
on my mind is all.

31:51.609 --> 31:53.477
Is it your family?

31:54.646 --> 31:56.413
No, they're fine.

32:22.507 --> 32:24.441
I'm glad you're here.

33:03.782 --> 33:05.549
I hate being alone.

33:15.627 --> 33:17.075
Bullying.

33:17.095 --> 33:18.528
Yes.

33:19.798 --> 33:21.346
Who's bullying him?

33:21.366 --> 33:23.081
No, Justin isn't being bullied.

33:23.101 --> 33:24.783
Justin is the bully.

33:24.803 --> 33:26.151
Oh.

33:26.171 --> 33:27.171
Yes.

33:28.706 --> 33:30.088
Alright, put him on to me.

33:30.108 --> 33:31.489
He doesn't want to talk to you.

33:31.509 --> 33:32.757
Of course he doesn't,
put him on to me.

33:32.777 --> 33:34.559
He's angry with you.

33:34.579 --> 33:35.393
He's angry with me?

33:35.413 --> 33:36.227
I did nothing.

33:36.247 --> 33:37.247
Exactly.

33:41.252 --> 33:43.301
The school want us to go
in and talk with them.

33:43.321 --> 33:44.235
When?

33:44.255 --> 33:45.737
Soon as possible.

33:45.757 --> 33:47.372
When are you back?

33:47.392 --> 33:48.573
When I'm finished.

33:48.593 --> 33:50.708
How predictably vague.

33:50.728 --> 33:51.743
Margaret, this is a big job.

33:51.763 --> 33:54.479
I can't just drop everything.

33:54.499 --> 33:57.115
- Are you alone?
- Yeah.

33:57.135 --> 34:00.537
I was, Olivia arrived
last night, yesterday.

34:01.873 --> 34:04.541
You were right the first time.

34:06.845 --> 34:11.329
We'll talk about things
when you get back.

34:11.349 --> 34:12.163
Well...

34:12.183 --> 34:13.431
Margaret, wait.

34:13.451 --> 34:15.152
What?

34:16.454 --> 34:17.635
Nothing.

34:17.655 --> 34:20.237
Nothing.

34:20.257 --> 34:22.574
It doesn't matter.

34:22.594 --> 34:23.594
Whatever.

34:24.696 --> 34:27.464
Enjoy the rest of
your break, Eric.

34:31.668 --> 34:34.152
Come on, Olivia, get out of bed.

34:34.172 --> 34:36.572
We're here to work, remember?

35:03.501 --> 35:04.634
Come on, Olivia.

35:36.568 --> 35:37.601
Sorry.

35:39.437 --> 35:40.537
You get them.

35:57.455 --> 35:58.670
It's so old.

35:58.690 --> 36:01.306
Why are you whispering?

36:01.326 --> 36:03.560
It's like a church in here.

36:37.362 --> 36:38.362
Eric?

36:44.435 --> 36:45.435
Eric?

37:20.938 --> 37:21.938
Eric?

37:25.343 --> 37:26.776
Where did you go?

37:28.379 --> 37:29.379
Eric?

37:35.720 --> 37:36.786
It's not funny.

37:41.993 --> 37:42.993
Okay, Eric.

37:53.705 --> 37:55.553
Eric, where did you go?

37:55.573 --> 37:56.873
I'm here.

37:57.875 --> 37:59.791
- Don't do that.
- What?

37:59.811 --> 38:00.925
Playin' hide and seek.

38:00.945 --> 38:03.461
Hand me the receiver.

38:03.481 --> 38:04.581
I was here.

38:07.752 --> 38:09.986
The light in here is weird.

38:17.061 --> 38:19.777
I'm not sure that this project
could go ahead anyway.

38:19.797 --> 38:20.778
The whole area will be...

38:20.798 --> 38:21.779
Not our concern, Olivia.

38:21.799 --> 38:23.414
We're just here to claim data.

38:23.434 --> 38:24.649
Okay, but I'm just
sayin' that...

38:24.669 --> 38:28.004
It's just we don't
need to talk about it.

38:31.042 --> 38:33.043
Did you pack everything?

38:34.779 --> 38:35.779
Olivia?

38:37.882 --> 38:38.882
Olivia?

38:39.918 --> 38:44.602
Sorry, I thought we weren't
allowed to talk about it.

38:47.692 --> 38:49.674
He grew to love having
that artificial eye.

38:49.694 --> 38:51.776
He used to pop it out
and shock people.

38:51.796 --> 38:52.744
Really?

38:52.764 --> 38:53.678
Yeah, we cousins, he'd
refuse to stay with us

38:53.698 --> 38:55.012
'cause he used to leave
it on the pillow

38:55.032 --> 38:56.714
and all that kinda thing.

38:56.734 --> 38:58.416
Oh my God.

38:58.436 --> 38:59.784
He even popped it out in
front of a teacher at school

38:59.804 --> 39:03.388
just to shut her up, and
then he got suspended.

39:03.408 --> 39:05.456
Actually, that's how
he got the nickname.

39:05.476 --> 39:06.090
Which was?

39:06.110 --> 39:06.924
Ballar.

39:06.944 --> 39:07.859
Ballar?

39:07.879 --> 39:10.828
Yeah, Ballar of the evil eye.

39:10.848 --> 39:13.064
It's a mythological demon.

39:13.084 --> 39:14.732
No?

39:14.752 --> 39:15.833
Whatever, they'd been
told about him in school.

39:15.853 --> 39:18.855
I see.

39:21.726 --> 39:24.509
This is nice though, isn't it?

39:24.529 --> 39:26.544
The general vicinity, I mean.

39:26.564 --> 39:28.665
It's remote and splendid.

39:29.834 --> 39:32.817
The type of place you
always go on about.

39:32.837 --> 39:35.486
Yeah, I could get used to it.

39:35.506 --> 39:36.821
Your ideal little idyll.

39:36.841 --> 39:39.524
Yeah, well that's just
me dreaming, isn't it?

39:39.544 --> 39:40.792
Yeah, well aren't you
meant to make your dreams

39:40.812 --> 39:41.859
come true in life?

39:41.879 --> 39:43.828
Just stop, Olivia.

39:43.848 --> 39:45.530
I have responsibilities.

39:45.550 --> 39:47.565
Justin, I can't just walk away.

39:47.585 --> 39:49.133
Yeah, your responsibilities,
you mentioned them...

39:49.153 --> 39:51.702
And what would you
understand about it?

39:51.722 --> 39:53.671
You don't know, you have your
whole life ahead of you.

39:53.691 --> 39:56.574
And what is it you think I
wanna do with that life?

39:56.594 --> 39:59.896
Eric, do you ever think
about what I want?

41:31.022 --> 41:32.589
Where did you go?

41:33.291 --> 41:34.291
Talk to me!

41:36.928 --> 41:38.094
Where are you?

41:47.805 --> 41:50.039
Eric, what are you doing?

41:51.242 --> 41:53.024
Can you hear that?

41:53.044 --> 41:54.959
Hear what?

41:54.979 --> 41:58.029
There was someone out here.

41:58.049 --> 42:01.217
The only person who's
out there is you.

42:05.923 --> 42:06.923
Come to bed.

42:08.593 --> 42:10.293
You're freakin' me out.

43:10.955 --> 43:13.671
Hi there in your little bed.

43:13.691 --> 43:15.124
You can come out.

43:18.829 --> 43:22.079
Better than a
doorbell, that fella.

43:22.099 --> 43:24.181
Sorry, hi, I'm Olivia.

43:24.201 --> 43:25.201
Gus.

43:29.173 --> 43:33.142
Visitors, great, come
on in for a cup of tea.

43:44.055 --> 43:46.255
Nice one for callin' in, man.

43:48.459 --> 43:50.893
I wasn't expecting company.

43:57.001 --> 43:59.250
You sure you won't have a cup?

43:59.270 --> 44:00.670
No, I'm fine.

44:01.839 --> 44:04.221
Where'd you get all
the stuff, Gus?

44:04.241 --> 44:06.123
I've been all over, mate.

44:06.143 --> 44:08.693
Mementos, markers
from the journey.

44:08.713 --> 44:10.995
Have you always traveled?

44:11.015 --> 44:12.081
Half my life.

44:13.250 --> 44:17.101
Occasionally I stop somewhere
for a while, like here.

44:17.121 --> 44:18.235
Yeah?

44:18.255 --> 44:20.723
Might stay put this time.

44:21.726 --> 44:24.193
Someone's been messing around.

44:25.262 --> 44:26.944
Messin' around?

44:26.964 --> 44:30.247
Yeah, with my equipment and
sneaking around the cottage.

44:30.267 --> 44:34.437
Yeah, well we don't know
if it's the same person.

44:37.174 --> 44:41.277
I have a feeling you're
asking was it me, lads.

44:46.183 --> 44:48.099
Well, it wasn't me.

44:48.119 --> 44:50.067
Don't think I have an
alibi or anything,

44:50.087 --> 44:53.322
but really, ask anyone,
I'm not the type.

44:54.525 --> 44:57.108
I don't know how I'm
gonna convince you.

44:57.128 --> 45:00.211
You're just gonna have
to take my word for it.

45:00.231 --> 45:02.198
Or get the law involved.

45:09.140 --> 45:11.307
You do what you need to.

45:17.414 --> 45:20.231
Who the hell else could it be?

45:20.251 --> 45:21.484
I have no idea.

45:23.320 --> 45:26.489
It's got nothin' to
do with me though.

45:31.796 --> 45:32.796
Alright.

45:36.233 --> 45:39.049
What's on the stove, Gus?

45:39.069 --> 45:40.069
Me stew.

45:40.805 --> 45:41.919
You hungry?

45:41.939 --> 45:42.939
Starvin'.

45:44.275 --> 45:45.956
Only made enough to last
me for a couple of days,

45:45.976 --> 45:50.795
but I'd rather lash it out
now and have the company.

45:50.815 --> 45:53.316
How 'bout yourself, Inspector?

45:55.352 --> 45:57.820
Yeah, yeah I'll try some.

45:59.456 --> 46:01.090
You're too kind.

46:08.499 --> 46:11.215
He was into Kirlian photography,
do you know what that is?

46:11.235 --> 46:13.050
No.

46:13.070 --> 46:14.151
Do you know what auras are?

46:14.171 --> 46:17.221
Oh, is that like the
glow or somethin'?

46:17.241 --> 46:19.223
Around living things, yeah.

46:19.243 --> 46:22.493
So with a plant, when
you tear a leaf off,

46:22.513 --> 46:25.863
the aura changes as if
the plant's distressed.

46:25.883 --> 46:28.232
What a tree-hugger.

46:28.252 --> 46:31.502
Devoy thought the trees
might be able to talk.

46:31.522 --> 46:35.239
He said the way they swayed in
the wind was sign language.

46:35.259 --> 46:38.175
When he saw branches
silhouetted against the sky,

46:38.195 --> 46:40.144
he thought they looked
like scribbled letters.

46:40.164 --> 46:43.180
He really did think the
trees might be able

46:43.200 --> 46:44.982
to say something to us.

46:45.002 --> 46:46.517
Jesus, okay, that is good.

46:46.537 --> 46:47.537
Yeah.

46:48.873 --> 46:51.222
No, he was a great advocate
of the Earth's own

46:51.242 --> 46:53.357
language guide.

46:53.377 --> 46:55.159
What?

46:55.179 --> 46:58.195
Hallucinogens, magic
mushrooms, things like that.

46:58.215 --> 47:00.297
Oh, okay, so you
tripped with him.

47:00.317 --> 47:02.251
Oh, yeah, did I what.

47:04.555 --> 47:06.570
I tripped everywhere with Devoy.

47:06.590 --> 47:08.272
You see, he was like me in
that he was only interested

47:08.292 --> 47:09.940
if it comes from the Earth.

47:09.960 --> 47:11.041
See, if it comes form the Earth,

47:11.061 --> 47:12.376
you know what you're getting.

47:12.396 --> 47:15.412
It's not some mongrel
batch of God knows what

47:15.432 --> 47:19.183
cooked up by God knows who
in some lab somewhere.

47:19.203 --> 47:21.204
No, it's pure, you know?

47:23.407 --> 47:26.223
Straight from God herself.

47:26.243 --> 47:29.426
You make it sound like a
religious thing or something.

47:29.446 --> 47:31.562
No time for religion then?

47:31.582 --> 47:33.264
No, not really.

47:33.284 --> 47:34.984
Me neither, man,

47:36.253 --> 47:39.403
but I'm not adverse to the
odd spiritual experience.

47:39.423 --> 47:41.038
So you still indulge?

47:41.058 --> 47:42.058
Sure.

47:43.394 --> 47:45.242
I think it's healthy.

47:45.262 --> 47:49.432
Shed the ego now and again,
and melt back into the world.

47:51.602 --> 47:54.285
Do you have anything here now?

47:54.305 --> 47:55.305
I do, yeah.

47:57.608 --> 47:59.390
Be fun to have some
sort of spiritual kick,

47:59.410 --> 48:00.624
wouldn't it, Eric?

48:00.644 --> 48:03.327
Come on, we have
work in the morning.

48:03.347 --> 48:05.262
Work will still be there
in the mornin', man.

48:05.282 --> 48:08.465
Yeah, but we have to
be able to do it.

48:08.485 --> 48:11.001
Yeah, well I want some, so.

48:11.021 --> 48:12.202
Come on, Olivia.

48:12.222 --> 48:13.404
What, it's just a bit of fun.

48:13.424 --> 48:16.225
You can always sack
me if you want.

48:21.065 --> 48:22.413
Eric, you sure?

48:22.433 --> 48:23.466
Yeah.

48:24.468 --> 48:27.051
Here, start with that.

48:33.677 --> 48:38.047
We just cut everything up
into salable little slabs.

48:39.450 --> 48:41.565
That's what we do.

48:41.585 --> 48:45.402
We just measure the land,
put boundaries around it,

48:45.422 --> 48:46.971
and we tell people
where they can go

48:46.991 --> 48:49.406
and when they can go there.

48:49.426 --> 48:51.976
Jesus, it's so obnoxious.

48:51.996 --> 48:53.744
We just read distances
and angles.

48:53.764 --> 48:55.713
I don't think we can be
blamed for what other people

48:55.733 --> 48:57.348
do with the data.

48:57.368 --> 48:59.402
Listen to Spock.

49:00.604 --> 49:03.320
Land surveying, huh?

49:03.340 --> 49:06.023
Something planned
for here, is there?

49:06.043 --> 49:08.492
It's just a survey
of the general area

49:08.512 --> 49:10.446
for academic records.

49:11.448 --> 49:14.031
I reckon we're
afraid of the world.

49:14.051 --> 49:15.566
I reckon we think
it's out to get us,

49:15.586 --> 49:17.468
so we have to get it first.

49:17.488 --> 49:19.069
I don't know, maybe
it is out to get us.

49:19.089 --> 49:23.107
Maybe it's like a
self-fulfilling prophecy.

49:23.127 --> 49:24.375
What do you think?

49:24.395 --> 49:26.477
Seriously, what do
you think though?

49:26.497 --> 49:28.779
We've lost touch with
the world, what it is.

49:28.799 --> 49:31.515
People are born, they're
given birth to,

49:31.535 --> 49:34.585
and they're immediately just
burdened with culture and class

49:34.605 --> 49:38.975
but like what about who they
really are underneath all that?

49:40.411 --> 49:42.411
Like who am I, you know?

49:43.547 --> 49:44.547
Who are you?

49:48.052 --> 49:49.433
And who the hell are you?

49:49.453 --> 49:51.168
Can you take it easy?

49:51.188 --> 49:54.471
Why is there somethin' the
matter with what I'm saying?

49:54.491 --> 49:56.373
I think I'm comin' up.

49:56.393 --> 49:57.393
What?

49:59.296 --> 50:01.712
I finished what was in the bag.

50:01.732 --> 50:03.632
You finished the bag?

50:08.272 --> 50:11.622
Some heap of mushrooms
you're eatin' there, man.

50:11.642 --> 50:14.425
Really, I thought
you took the same?

50:14.445 --> 50:15.478
No.

50:18.082 --> 50:19.496
You'll be fine.

50:19.516 --> 50:21.550
You'll enjoy yourself.

50:22.586 --> 50:24.368
That's some heap of mushrooms.

50:27.624 --> 50:29.139
Alright, I don't
feel great, so...

50:29.159 --> 50:31.794
Oi, you're gonna be grand, Eric.

50:33.363 --> 50:35.345
It's a nice, clear night.

50:35.365 --> 50:37.147
Let's go for a walk.

50:37.167 --> 50:37.781
A walk.

50:37.801 --> 50:39.416
- Eric.
- Yeah.

50:39.436 --> 50:40.603
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

50:41.605 --> 50:43.854
That's so impulsive, Eric, wow.

50:43.874 --> 50:45.856
Oh God, Olivia, you
are way too...

50:45.876 --> 50:47.410
What?

50:50.414 --> 50:51.414
There.

50:53.550 --> 50:54.784
Let's go.

51:09.833 --> 51:10.833
Go play.

51:17.508 --> 51:20.224
So you can read the
trees, then, Olivia?

51:20.244 --> 51:22.226
Yeah, I can.

51:22.246 --> 51:23.827
What are they sayin'?

51:23.847 --> 51:25.596
They're lookin' down
on the human race,

51:25.616 --> 51:28.398
and they're sayin' what
a bunch of arseholes.

51:29.419 --> 51:33.570
Yeah, well some people
like to live in nature.

51:33.590 --> 51:35.839
Other people like to
catch it and kill it

51:35.859 --> 51:38.642
and put its head on a wall.

51:38.662 --> 51:41.378
Yeah, his wife puts his
head in a cabinet.

51:41.398 --> 51:42.913
Every now and again,
she'll open it

51:42.933 --> 51:45.282
and she'll slap him
across the face.

51:47.404 --> 51:48.919
What are you guys talkin' about?

51:48.939 --> 51:51.655
Oh nothing, man.

51:51.675 --> 51:54.110
Just sucking the country air.

51:56.713 --> 51:58.147
What's funny?

51:59.616 --> 52:02.266
In today's spotlight,
we've got Eric Mayberry,

52:02.286 --> 52:06.203
a part-time adulterer and
a full-time curmudgeon.

52:06.223 --> 52:08.906
How are you feeling today, Eric?

52:08.926 --> 52:10.507
Pretty freaked out.

52:10.527 --> 52:13.610
Why are you freaked out?

52:13.630 --> 52:16.280
I think I'm hallucinating.

52:16.300 --> 52:18.534
What do you see?

52:20.837 --> 52:22.786
Are you alone?

52:22.806 --> 52:25.808
Heard you need the bitch.

52:27.778 --> 52:30.360
Just go with it, man.

52:30.380 --> 52:32.429
You alright, Eric?

52:32.449 --> 52:33.969
You should turn your
coat inside out.

52:39.323 --> 52:41.157
What's funny?

52:42.826 --> 52:44.441
Is that funny?

52:44.461 --> 52:45.461
It's funny.

52:49.399 --> 52:51.467
It's alright, man, relax.

53:15.959 --> 53:18.394
I think I'll head to bed.

53:19.363 --> 53:21.931
That's another day's work lost.

53:22.799 --> 53:25.401
Are you alright, man?

53:26.903 --> 53:27.903
Yeah.

53:29.773 --> 53:32.589
I think I'm gonna get goin'.

53:32.609 --> 53:33.842
It's been unreal.

53:36.847 --> 53:38.028
I'll walk you out.

53:38.048 --> 53:39.348
Yeah.

54:25.095 --> 54:26.095
Eric.

54:27.631 --> 54:30.347
We have no electricity.

54:30.367 --> 54:31.782
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah, I know.

54:31.802 --> 54:33.517
Where is everything?

54:33.537 --> 54:34.785
What?

54:34.805 --> 54:37.806
Candles, torches,
it's gonna get dark.

54:38.809 --> 54:40.976
Oh, Jesus, I don't know.

55:20.784 --> 55:23.867
Eric, come in here and
have a look at these.

55:23.887 --> 55:25.554
What is it?

55:28.692 --> 55:30.040
Have you found candles?

55:30.060 --> 55:33.429
Yep, and all this
other weird stuff.

55:34.164 --> 55:35.164
Here.

55:50.847 --> 55:51.980
This looks cool.

55:58.522 --> 55:59.955
Gonna hang these up.

56:02.759 --> 56:03.792
Devoy.

56:05.095 --> 56:06.777
Come on downstairs.

56:06.797 --> 56:08.879
I'm gonna read you a story
from your special book.

56:08.899 --> 56:10.766
What special book?

56:11.835 --> 56:14.069
You know what special book.

56:29.786 --> 56:33.470
The Knowledge of Trees
by William Devoy.

56:33.490 --> 56:34.204
Okay, here.

56:34.224 --> 56:36.072
What is the meaning of trees?

56:36.092 --> 56:38.074
Plants, vegetation, nature.

56:38.094 --> 56:40.043
Is there grammar in
all the greenery?

56:40.063 --> 56:42.446
Is there syntax in
all the spawning?

56:42.466 --> 56:44.114
Are leaves linguistic?

56:44.134 --> 56:45.949
Is there something worth
reading in the scripts

56:45.969 --> 56:50.020
of bent trunks and stems, in
crooked branches and petals?

56:50.040 --> 56:51.721
I know there is.

56:51.741 --> 56:54.558
I've come to understand
there's a book of nature,

56:54.578 --> 56:57.527
and all I have to do is
find out how to open it,

56:57.547 --> 57:00.416
turn the pages, and
read the words.

57:02.919 --> 57:04.534
Natural, oh.

57:04.554 --> 57:07.737
Natural narcotics help
me read the world

57:07.757 --> 57:10.774
from my belly to my brain,
and bang I see it suddenly

57:10.794 --> 57:12.843
with ferocious clarity.

57:12.863 --> 57:15.612
Everything is involved in
a kind of choreography.

57:15.632 --> 57:19.549
Light wind, organic matter,
all dance to a silent tune.

57:19.569 --> 57:21.184
Everything shines.

57:21.204 --> 57:24.106
This is a vibrating,
verdant world.

57:25.809 --> 57:28.859
This is everything we need.

57:28.879 --> 57:31.480
This is what was taken from us.

57:33.650 --> 57:34.716
This is Eden.

57:38.788 --> 57:41.838
My God, this guy must've
had some serious stash.

57:41.858 --> 57:43.992
Let's search the place.

57:51.134 --> 57:53.950
Anyway, it's mostly
just drawings of plants

57:53.970 --> 57:55.904
and fungus and stuff.

57:57.107 --> 57:59.956
It's pretty crazy, isn't it?

57:59.976 --> 58:03.693
I don't know, maybe he
was on to something.

58:03.713 --> 58:06.096
Maybe he was enlightened.

58:09.653 --> 58:10.653
Yeah.

58:16.660 --> 58:17.660
Eric.

59:44.080 --> 59:44.995
That's almost everything.

59:45.015 --> 59:47.931
So listen, you head
back to the cottage.

59:47.951 --> 59:49.666
I'm gonna go for a wander.

59:49.686 --> 59:51.701
I'll walk back later.

59:51.721 --> 59:54.270
- Really?
- Yeah, just feel like a walk.

59:54.290 --> 59:55.290
Right.

01:01:09.899 --> 01:01:10.899
Hello?

01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:00.883
Fuck.

01:03:03.079 --> 01:03:04.861
Jesus, Olivia, you
frightened me.

01:03:04.881 --> 01:03:08.183
Yeah, everything frightens you.

01:03:11.955 --> 01:03:13.102
How's Gus?

01:03:13.122 --> 01:03:14.337
What?

01:03:14.357 --> 01:03:15.271
Well, you took your time.

01:03:15.291 --> 01:03:17.540
I take it you dropped in on him.

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:18.908
Mm hm, yeah I did.

01:03:18.928 --> 01:03:20.210
He's fine.

01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:22.230
That's lovely to hear.

01:03:23.933 --> 01:03:26.850
I can't find the last
day's field readings.

01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:28.084
Have you been using this?

01:03:28.104 --> 01:03:29.271
No.

01:03:30.306 --> 01:03:31.321
I can't find the readings.

01:03:31.341 --> 01:03:33.108
I mean, they're gone.

01:03:34.911 --> 01:03:36.059
Sorry, I didn't mean to laugh.

01:03:36.079 --> 01:03:38.380
Just tired, maybe we both are.

01:03:40.283 --> 01:03:41.231
Are you looking for attention?

01:03:41.251 --> 01:03:42.465
Is that what this is?

01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:43.485
What?

01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:45.635
The way you've been behaving.

01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:48.538
Making us take
mushrooms and things.

01:03:48.558 --> 01:03:50.006
I didn't make you take anything.

01:03:50.026 --> 01:03:52.242
Reading from that
mad man's book,

01:03:52.262 --> 01:03:54.043
and hanging his pictures
all around the place.

01:03:54.063 --> 01:03:55.578
Is this some kind of game?

01:03:55.598 --> 01:03:57.213
What exactly are you
accusing me of?

01:03:57.233 --> 01:03:59.349
Is this all at my expense?

01:03:59.369 --> 01:04:01.351
I mean, I don't feel like
I'm out here to do my job.

01:04:01.371 --> 01:04:04.520
I don't know what we're
supposed to be doing.

01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:06.256
Did you arrange this
with the others?

01:04:06.276 --> 01:04:07.991
- The others?
- Yeah, Olivia.

01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:10.360
The others, Gus, the
locals, or the client.

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:11.961
I mean, it just
feels like a setup.

01:04:11.981 --> 01:04:13.663
There's a real vindictive
vibe to all this.

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:15.365
A vindictive vibe?

01:04:15.385 --> 01:04:18.401
Yeah, I sense an aura,
like in those photographs.

01:04:18.421 --> 01:04:20.270
What was that stuff
with the interrogation?

01:04:20.290 --> 01:04:21.905
Shining a torn in my face.

01:04:21.925 --> 01:04:25.909
I mean, are you really that
fucking angry with me?

01:04:25.929 --> 01:04:27.944
I don't want things to change.

01:04:27.964 --> 01:04:30.914
Things don't have to change.

01:04:30.934 --> 01:04:32.615
Why is everything changing?

01:04:32.635 --> 01:04:34.951
I'm really confused
about all this, Eric.

01:04:34.971 --> 01:04:37.687
Just tell me, and
we can sort it out.

01:04:37.707 --> 01:04:39.122
Tell you what?

01:04:39.142 --> 01:04:42.077
Why are you trying
to tear me apart?

01:05:01.631 --> 01:05:03.331
Olivia, I'm sorry.

01:05:05.001 --> 01:05:05.949
I don't feel comfortable
staying here

01:05:05.969 --> 01:05:07.517
with you anymore, Eric.

01:05:07.537 --> 01:05:10.453
Stop, where you gonna go?

01:05:10.473 --> 01:05:11.454
I don't know, somewhere
in the village.

01:05:11.474 --> 01:05:12.555
I'm not gonna stay here.

01:05:12.575 --> 01:05:14.157
It's late, this is silly.

01:05:14.177 --> 01:05:15.177
Just stop.

01:05:22.352 --> 01:05:23.466
Get out of my way.

01:05:23.486 --> 01:05:24.501
No, just put your bag down.

01:05:24.521 --> 01:05:25.635
- Get out of my way, Eric.
- Put the bag down.

01:05:25.655 --> 01:05:27.923
Olivia, put the bag down!

01:06:03.493 --> 01:06:06.161
Olivia, come on, get in the car.

01:06:09.532 --> 01:06:10.480
This is crazy.

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:14.302
No, you're fucking crazy, Eric!

01:06:21.444 --> 01:06:23.678
Olivia, I'm sorry.

01:06:26.349 --> 01:06:27.530
Let's talk about it.

01:06:27.550 --> 01:06:29.617
Jesus, don't just walk off.

01:06:32.555 --> 01:06:34.470
Please, I said I was sorry.

01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:36.406
This is stupid.

01:06:36.426 --> 01:06:37.459
Ah, shit.

01:06:44.534 --> 01:06:45.567
Olivia.

01:07:57.373 --> 01:07:58.373
Stop!

01:07:59.809 --> 01:08:01.190
Stop!

01:08:01.210 --> 01:08:03.259
Mr. Mayberry?

01:08:03.279 --> 01:08:04.345
Mr. Mayberry?

01:08:06.282 --> 01:08:09.284
Mr. Mayberry, is
everything alright?

01:08:12.889 --> 01:08:15.657
Mr. Mayberry, do you need help?

01:16:43.032 --> 01:16:44.032
Hey.

01:16:48.003 --> 01:16:49.036
Hey!

01:16:55.744 --> 01:16:57.126
Where you goin'?

01:16:57.146 --> 01:16:58.179
Hey.

01:17:06.789 --> 01:17:07.789
Hey!

01:17:11.093 --> 01:17:12.093
Wait!

01:17:18.067 --> 01:17:19.300
Where'd you go?

01:17:21.937 --> 01:17:23.419
Where'd you go?

01:17:23.439 --> 01:17:24.687
Hey.

01:18:12.855 --> 01:18:13.855
Hey!

01:18:52.227 --> 01:18:53.227
Communicate!

01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:39.400
Eric?

01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:42.203
Eric, you there?

01:20:46.275 --> 01:20:49.143
Eric, it's me, are you in there?

01:20:52.414 --> 01:20:53.414
Eric?

01:23:13.388 --> 01:23:14.388
Eric!

01:23:17.759 --> 01:23:18.759
Eric!

01:23:19.494 --> 01:23:20.527
Eric!

01:23:29.104 --> 01:23:30.170
Eric!

01:23:40.382 --> 01:23:41.415
Dad?

01:23:43.351 --> 01:23:44.351
I'm sorry.

01:23:46.221 --> 01:23:47.221
Dad!

01:23:56.665 --> 01:23:58.280
Hey, come on.

01:23:58.300 --> 01:24:01.568
Let's go back and join
the others, okay?

01:27:15.630 --> 01:27:17.264
Hey, over here!

01:27:23.772 --> 01:27:24.805
Eric.

01:27:28.710 --> 01:27:30.010
Here, warm him up.

01:27:31.012 --> 01:27:32.894
- Eric.
- Get an ambulance!

01:27:32.914 --> 01:27:34.596
Can you hear me?

01:27:34.616 --> 01:27:36.464
Eric, it's me.

01:27:36.484 --> 01:27:37.599
- Eric.
- Your jacket.

01:27:37.619 --> 01:27:39.000
Put your jacket on him.

01:27:39.020 --> 01:27:40.020
Olivia.

01:27:43.558 --> 01:27:45.392
Did you get someone?

01:27:46.695 --> 01:27:47.695
Eric.
