00:09.592 --> 00:11.594


00:11.678 --> 00:13.930


00:14.014 --> 00:15.015


00:21.896 --> 00:23.732


00:23.815 --> 00:25.984


00:32.198 --> 00:34.284


00:34.367 --> 00:37.454


00:38.204 --> 00:40.540


00:41.041 --> 00:44.586


00:44.669 --> 00:47.714
Campers who signed up
for Capture the Golden Pineapple,

00:47.797 --> 00:50.091
we're meeting over here now, because--

00:50.175 --> 00:52.218


00:52.302 --> 00:53.136
Cool?

00:53.219 --> 00:54.179


00:54.262 --> 00:56.264
Aw, do we have to?

00:56.347 --> 00:59.934
All this competition
makes me feel kinda… explodey.

01:00.018 --> 01:01.936
Um, can I be on not his team?

01:02.020 --> 01:03.438
'Kay, thanks.

01:03.521 --> 01:06.066
Look, this game isn't for the weak.

01:06.149 --> 01:08.777
It's about total domination
of your opponents.

01:08.860 --> 01:12.655
And the glory that comes from
being the first to find that!

01:20.663 --> 01:23.500
Yah! Awww!

01:23.583 --> 01:25.418
I can't wait to sink my beak

01:25.502 --> 01:29.422
into that sweet, juicy
delicious, 24-karat goodness!

01:29.506 --> 01:32.926
Uh, it's not real gold,
and you're not supposed to eat it.

01:33.009 --> 01:33.885
I'm out!

01:34.969 --> 01:37.347
Okay, we're gonna split up into…

01:39.224 --> 01:40.600
Sorry, dudes.

01:40.683 --> 01:41.976
Wild night last night.

01:44.562 --> 01:46.481
Oh, yeah!

01:51.694 --> 01:54.948
Ugh! Okay, Cheeps!
Rules go like this,

01:55.031 --> 01:57.700
Mighty Eagle splits us into three teams,

01:57.784 --> 02:00.620
then he hides this baby somewhere in camp.

02:00.703 --> 02:01.996
Right?

02:02.080 --> 02:03.248
What she said.

02:03.331 --> 02:08.002
First team to find it and get it back
here to the dining hall wins. <i>Capisce?</i>

02:08.086 --> 02:11.047
-Ahem!

02:11.131 --> 02:13.591
Okay, so, captains.

02:14.592 --> 02:16.177
-Stella.
-Yes!

02:18.012 --> 02:19.639
My main pig, Penley!

02:21.349 --> 02:24.185
Last captain is… Red!

02:24.269 --> 02:26.479
Okay, you dudes
are with the Red dude.

02:27.105 --> 02:29.149
You dudes are with the green dude.

02:29.232 --> 02:32.443
And the rest of you dudes
are with the pink dude.

02:32.527 --> 02:33.653
-Hmph!
-Ugh!

02:33.736 --> 02:37.073
Oh, man. You two on opposing teams?

02:37.157 --> 02:38.950
Should we be scared?
We should be scared, right?

02:39.033 --> 02:40.285
Why would you say that?

02:40.368 --> 02:41.744
Because once you start
going at it,

02:41.828 --> 02:44.581
Stella will morph into
an unstoppable competitive beast!

02:44.664 --> 02:47.876
Yeah, and you'll puff up like a ferocious
angry blowfish!

02:47.959 --> 02:49.878
Things'll get real crazy.

02:49.961 --> 02:51.004
Blood will flow.

02:51.087 --> 02:53.006
Tears will be shed!

02:53.089 --> 02:54.674
Happens every time.

02:54.757 --> 02:56.092
Nope, not gonna happen!

02:56.175 --> 02:58.469
Exactly! Our friendship's too important.

02:58.553 --> 02:59.846
Then let's make a pact.

02:59.929 --> 03:02.682
We're in it to win it,
but let's keep it clean.

03:02.765 --> 03:06.936
Right. No sabotage, no backstabbing.
Just a fair fight.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.272
Glad to hear you'll keep the carnage
to a minimum.

03:09.355 --> 03:10.899
I'm gonna hide this thing.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.986
Nice job. He totally bought it!

03:15.069 --> 03:16.863
Now, how are we really gonna win this?

03:16.946 --> 03:19.365
I made a promise and I meant it, okay?

03:19.449 --> 03:21.200
No funny business.

03:21.284 --> 03:24.203
And as your team captain, that's final!

03:24.287 --> 03:26.331
Ugh. Okay, sheesh.

03:27.790 --> 03:29.751
Can I try your balloon launcher?

03:29.834 --> 03:30.668
Yeah, sure.

03:33.504 --> 03:34.547
What the--

03:35.632 --> 03:37.050
-Stella!
-Huh?

03:37.133 --> 03:38.343
Uh--

03:38.426 --> 03:41.763
Wow, you're seriously
breaking the pact already?

03:41.846 --> 03:45.058
Uh, if I wanted to beat you, I wouldn't
need a cheap shot to do it.

03:45.141 --> 03:47.352
Oh, yeah, she'd totally crush you.

03:47.435 --> 03:48.895
Sure, if she played dirty!

03:48.978 --> 03:50.772
Ooh! Sounds like that
really triggers you!

03:50.855 --> 03:54.067
Oh, I'm triggered!
I should have known this would happen!

03:54.150 --> 03:56.444
Why? Because you were sure
Stella couldn't keep her word

03:56.527 --> 03:58.154
and would instantly resort to sabotage?

03:58.238 --> 04:01.074
Ohh! Can you believe
what he's saying about you?

04:01.157 --> 04:04.160
You know what? Pact is dis-pacted!

04:04.244 --> 04:05.870
-Fine.
-Bring it.

04:05.954 --> 04:07.538
Fine!

04:07.622 --> 04:09.707
Well, that was easy.

04:11.376 --> 04:12.585
-Every time.
-Every time.

04:13.670 --> 04:16.673
Right. Listen up! No more Mr. Nice Bird!

04:16.756 --> 04:20.385
Uh, when was there a Mr. Nice Bird?
The game just started.

04:20.468 --> 04:22.387
Red wants to mess with us?

04:22.470 --> 04:24.222
Well, you don't mess with a messer.

04:24.305 --> 04:26.099
I'm gonna mess him up but good!

04:26.182 --> 04:29.435
That's more like it. Unleash that beast!

04:29.519 --> 04:31.771
Are we still trying to get the pineapple?

04:31.854 --> 04:35.233
Uh, duh! But the best offense is…

04:35.316 --> 04:36.526
A good defense?

04:36.609 --> 04:39.112
Not if you take out the competition first.

04:39.195 --> 04:42.657
Exhibit A. I know from a school field
trip to a jelly factory

04:42.740 --> 04:44.492
that Red hates jelly.

04:44.575 --> 04:49.539
Stella looks brave, but did you know
she's terrified of googly eyes?

04:49.622 --> 04:54.335
Hot tip. It's impossible for Red not to
dance salsa when he hears the maracas.

04:54.419 --> 04:56.254
So, if you need a diversion…

04:56.337 --> 04:58.923
The Dojo is Stella's
favorite spot in camp.

04:59.007 --> 05:03.428
She's bound to start searching there,
and it's about to become her nightmare.

05:03.511 --> 05:05.888
-So let's get out there--
-And crush--

05:05.972 --> 05:07.098
-That--
-Bird!

05:08.558 --> 05:10.435
What are we supposed to be doing again?

05:10.518 --> 05:14.022
No clue. I want to be away from
the atomic blast of those two going at it.

05:14.105 --> 05:15.189
More lemonade slushy?

05:15.273 --> 05:17.150
Ooh! Don't mind if I do!

05:17.692 --> 05:20.361
The Golden Pineapple's gotta be around
here somewhere!

05:20.445 --> 05:21.779
But if I know Stella,

05:21.863 --> 05:24.741
she's already covered her tracks
with tons of booby traps.

05:24.824 --> 05:27.201
-Hey, I found something!
-No!

05:29.620 --> 05:31.581
Avenge me!

05:32.206 --> 05:35.084
Stella!

05:36.210 --> 05:38.546
I gotta good feeling the pineapple's
in here--

05:38.629 --> 05:40.381
Oh no! Googly eyes!

05:40.465 --> 05:43.551
Nice to "see" you, Stella!

05:43.634 --> 05:45.553
Aah!

05:46.137 --> 05:47.597
-Whoo!
-Ugh!

05:49.140 --> 05:51.017
Hmm.

05:52.560 --> 05:55.146
Incoming grape jelly.

05:57.607 --> 05:58.608
Ugh!

06:00.193 --> 06:01.527
Grape jelly? Aah!

06:03.863 --> 06:05.573
Whoa! Whoaaa!

06:06.115 --> 06:08.910
Avenge me, too!

06:09.368 --> 06:11.120
Let's find that pineapple already.

06:12.705 --> 06:14.624
Yow! Grr!

06:14.707 --> 06:18.169
Somebody get me out of here!
Ugh! Ooh!

06:18.252 --> 06:21.214
Uh, your victory dance is
looking a little weak.

06:21.297 --> 06:24.258
-You're right! I like yours better.

06:24.342 --> 06:26.135
Not the maracas!

06:27.386 --> 06:30.556
Can't. Resist. Moving. Feet.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.391
Well, it doesn't matter anyways,

06:32.475 --> 06:34.602
because I know where the pineapple is!

06:38.815 --> 06:42.568
Red!

06:42.652 --> 06:44.195
Oh!

06:44.987 --> 06:46.447
-Every time.
-Every time.

06:49.158 --> 06:51.410
-Red's gonna find that pineapple!

06:51.494 --> 06:54.664
'Cause he's playing dirty. So you…

06:54.747 --> 06:56.040
-Unh!

06:56.124 --> 06:57.458
Gotta get dirtier!

06:57.542 --> 06:59.877
Puh! I just did.

06:59.961 --> 07:02.171
Okay, let's do this!

07:02.255 --> 07:03.589
-Ahh!
-Oof!

07:05.883 --> 07:07.927
-Just as I suspected.

07:08.010 --> 07:09.762
You totally forgot
to hide it, didn't you?

07:09.846 --> 07:13.683
Oh, yeah!
My bad, bro!

07:13.766 --> 07:15.351
Knew there was something.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.353
Unh!

07:22.066 --> 07:24.193
<i>Attention, campers!</i>

07:24.277 --> 07:28.281
<i>Gather round to hear the secret</i>
<i>Red doesn't want you to know.</i>

07:29.949 --> 07:30.825
Stella, no!

07:30.908 --> 07:33.286
<i>The year was… not that long ago,</i>

07:33.369 --> 07:37.248
<i>and Red really needed to use the bathroom</i>
<i>in Arts and Crafts.</i>

07:37.331 --> 07:39.041
<i>-So bad,</i>
-What the--

07:39.125 --> 07:42.712
<i>he earned the nickname</i>
<i>Pee Pee Glitter Pants.</i>

07:42.795 --> 07:45.673
-No!

07:52.555 --> 07:54.849
Wow, nice work, Captain!

07:54.932 --> 07:56.934
I wasn't sure you had it in you.

07:57.018 --> 07:59.312
You crossed a line, Stella!

07:59.395 --> 08:01.439
A solid friendship line!

08:01.522 --> 08:05.485
So covering the Dojo in googly eyes
isn't crossing a line?

08:05.568 --> 08:08.154
You told the entire camp
about Pee Pee Glitter Pants,

08:08.237 --> 08:10.573
and you glued my feet to the floor!

08:10.656 --> 08:12.867
Oh, no. That was <i>moi</i>!

08:12.950 --> 08:16.204
-I'll take that, thank you very much.
-Give that back! Ooh!

08:16.287 --> 08:17.163
I don't think so.

08:17.246 --> 08:20.708
I'm going to take this pineapple
to the dining hall and win it myself.

08:20.791 --> 08:22.543
What, no way! Grr!

08:22.627 --> 08:23.836
Oh! Huh?!

08:23.920 --> 08:26.130
Oh, I glued your feet as well.

08:26.214 --> 08:27.298
How did you do that?

08:27.381 --> 08:29.217
We were standing here the whole time!

08:29.300 --> 08:31.636
Oh, I'm just that good.

08:31.719 --> 08:34.555
I mean, I got Stella to backstab
and betray her best friend!

08:34.639 --> 08:35.723
-All it took was

08:35.806 --> 08:37.850
one well-placed water balloon.

08:37.934 --> 08:40.311
Well, I'm sure you two have a lot
of stuff to work through.

08:40.394 --> 08:42.772
I'm gonna go claim my victory.

08:42.855 --> 08:44.315
Bye!

08:44.398 --> 08:47.109
Wow, I should have seen that coming.

08:47.193 --> 08:50.488
That, and I'm sorry, for everything.

08:50.571 --> 08:51.572
Me too.

08:51.656 --> 08:54.116
The whole point of our pact
was that our friendship

08:54.200 --> 08:56.244
was way more important
than some dumb game.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.204
It totally is!

08:58.287 --> 09:01.666
I don't give a bird's squirt
about anything that happened today.

09:01.749 --> 09:03.125
You're my best friend.

09:04.001 --> 09:06.504
Get out of my way!
I'm gonna win!

09:06.587 --> 09:08.422
We can't let her do that.

09:16.180 --> 09:18.349
These skis are slowing us down!

09:19.350 --> 09:21.435
Oh, no, they're not.

09:34.031 --> 09:36.325
Whoa!

09:39.829 --> 09:42.873
Oh, no, you don't.
You're not gonna stop me!

09:49.505 --> 09:51.132
-Hey!

09:51.215 --> 09:52.717
Get off! Let go!

09:52.800 --> 09:54.010
Ohh!

09:54.093 --> 09:55.303
The dining hall!

10:01.350 --> 10:03.311
Today has been truly delightful.

10:03.394 --> 10:04.812
Agreed! Right, Penley?

10:07.148 --> 10:10.735
All right! My main pig Penley's team wins.

10:12.153 --> 10:13.362
Do-over!

10:13.446 --> 10:15.656
I need a do-over! Ugh!

10:15.740 --> 10:19.285
What are you two dancing about?
You lost!

10:19.368 --> 10:22.079
You losing is our victory.

10:28.085 --> 10:30.338
Team Lemon Slushy for the win!

10:30.421 --> 10:33.257
I never doubted us for a second.
Come to Papa!

10:37.762 --> 10:39.805
Eh!

10:39.889 --> 10:41.557
So good!
