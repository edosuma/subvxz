WEBVTT

00:01.668 --> 00:05.832
I've been looking for this everywhere.
I'm so glad you thought of the attic.

00:05.905 --> 00:09.272
Me, too, 'cause I've been looking
for this everywhere.

00:09.342 --> 00:13.676
Now I can finally organize
the family photos. Isn't that great?

00:14.280 --> 00:16.612
- Take off the hat, Tim.
- Sorry.

00:18.818 --> 00:21.912
- And the wig.
- I think it's working with the outfit.

00:21.988 --> 00:25.287
- I don't think so, no.
- This is not a good idea.

00:25.358 --> 00:27.326
You're gonna drive yourself crazy.

00:27.427 --> 00:30.157
School is winding down.
I'm just gonna make time.

00:30.230 --> 00:33.859
I've been feeling really bad
about neglecting the family stuff.

00:33.933 --> 00:37.266
This is a legacy
that I can hand down to the boys.

00:37.337 --> 00:40.602
I think the legacy they'd prefer
is cold hard cash.

00:42.108 --> 00:45.202
There's a thousand pictures.
I don't know where to start.

00:45.278 --> 00:48.645
I got an idea. Why don't we put all this
back in the box, seal it up,

00:48.748 --> 00:51.410
and put it in a place
where you can't remember?

00:51.484 --> 00:54.715
I wanna do this.
These are family heirlooms.

00:54.788 --> 01:00.158
An heirloom is a gold watch,
not Randy eating out of a garbage can.

01:01.528 --> 01:03.689
What is this old picture?

01:05.031 --> 01:07.363
That's when I graduated driver's ed.

01:08.868 --> 01:10.961
I was the valedictorian.

01:11.037 --> 01:14.803
Oh, look at this picture of the kids.
This is what? The summer of 1991.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.273
Arert they cute?

01:19.446 --> 01:21.937
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:32.859 --> 01:34.827
Hang onto this.

02:24.244 --> 02:27.509
- Does everybody know what time it is?
- Tool Time!

02:27.580 --> 02:32.711
That's right! Binford Tools is proud
to present Tim The Tool Man Taylor!

02:37.023 --> 02:38.513
Thank you!

02:39.659 --> 02:41.820
Thank you, everybody. Thank you.

02:43.129 --> 02:47.657
<i>Welcome to Tool Time. I am, and shall
always be, Tim The Tool Man Taylor.</i>

02:47.734 --> 02:51.602
And you all know the other guy.

02:51.671 --> 02:54.640
Thank you.

02:56.943 --> 03:01.243
All week long we have been showing you
prototypes of new and exciting tools.

03:01.314 --> 03:04.613
But now it's big news time.
Heidi, our big news desk, please.

03:04.684 --> 03:06.447
You got it.

03:06.519 --> 03:09.420
We have a Binford tool
that's out of this world.

03:09.489 --> 03:13.050
And our two next guests
have actually been out of this world.

03:13.159 --> 03:16.720
Let's welcome NASA astronauts
Ken Bowersox and Steve Hawley.

03:19.399 --> 03:21.060
Hi!

03:29.442 --> 03:31.342
Welcome to the show, guys.

03:31.411 --> 03:34.073
We are welcoming back
Commander Bowersox.

03:34.147 --> 03:36.081
This is Kers third appearance.

03:36.149 --> 03:39.448
Third appearance
on a low-rated cable show.

03:39.519 --> 03:42.488
You astronauts must have
a lot of free time, Ken, huh?

03:42.589 --> 03:45.080
No, we don't,
but the folks at NASA send us here

03:45.158 --> 03:48.650
'cause they love watching me
make fun of you.

03:51.130 --> 03:54.691
They don't have much to do
except organize their pocket protectors

03:54.801 --> 03:56.632
and swill Tang.

03:58.171 --> 04:01.436
Why don't you tell our audience
the real reason you're here?

04:01.507 --> 04:05.170
- I wanted to meet Heidi.
- Steve?

04:05.245 --> 04:08.681
A Binford tool's been chosen
to fly in the space shuttle.

04:08.748 --> 04:12.514
That's right. Many major corporations
were vying for this privilege,

04:12.619 --> 04:14.052
but Binford won.

04:14.120 --> 04:16.884
Steve, why don't you tell us
about the Binford tool?

04:16.956 --> 04:19.789
It's the Binford 2001
computerized wrench.

04:19.858 --> 04:23.158
You can preprogram
the amount of torque, turn and speed.

04:23.229 --> 04:27.598
- It stores the data in the computer.
- I believe I was talking to Steve, Ken.

04:27.700 --> 04:30.760
Having our wrench chosen
is a great honor for Binford.

04:30.837 --> 04:33.203
But a prototype like that
is very expensive.

04:33.306 --> 04:36.275
Actually, NASA isn't paying for it.
Binford is.

04:38.745 --> 04:42.681
Ho ho ho ho ho.

04:42.749 --> 04:46.185
Get a prototype and you don't
pay for it? Sounds like a scam to me.

04:46.252 --> 04:48.743
Well, there's one more thing
you need to know, Tim.

04:48.821 --> 04:52.552
One Binford employee gets to fly along
on the mission to operate the wrench.

04:56.596 --> 05:00.464
- Well, I'm a Binford employee.
- Who thinks the space program's a scam.

05:00.533 --> 05:05.561
I said SPAM. It's a good luncheon meat.
You can take it up there with you...

05:05.638 --> 05:10.007
I, as opposed to Tim,
have always thought highly of NASA.

05:10.076 --> 05:12.601
And I am very pleased
that the next mission

05:12.679 --> 05:16.046
will be the first ever
commanded by a woman.

05:16.149 --> 05:19.414
Commander Eileen Collins,
if you're watching,

05:19.485 --> 05:21.646
Al thinks it's about time.

05:25.358 --> 05:30.819
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I think...
I think it's about time Al sat down

05:30.897 --> 05:33.627
and removed his lips from NASA's butt.

05:37.570 --> 05:39.538
- Hi there.
- Oh, hi.

05:39.639 --> 05:43.268
- Still working on those pictures, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

05:43.343 --> 05:47.074
How would you feel
if I told you I needed a little space?

05:48.915 --> 05:52.681
I don't know. Depends on
what you mean by a little space.

05:52.752 --> 05:54.481
I mean all of space.

05:54.554 --> 05:58.422
This sounds crazy, but I might have
a chance to go up on the space shuttle.

05:58.491 --> 06:01.255
How soon can you leave?

06:02.462 --> 06:04.430
Listen, this is serious.

06:04.530 --> 06:07.363
NASA picked a Binford tool
to go on the next mission.

06:07.433 --> 06:10.334
They need a payload specialist
to operate it...

06:11.537 --> 06:15.496
- And they chose you?
- Well, not yet.

06:15.575 --> 06:18.601
I'd have to take some physical
and psychological exams.

06:18.678 --> 06:22.842
Should I beat out my competition,
I train for six months and get to go up.

06:24.117 --> 06:26.551
- Is this for real?
- This is for real.

06:26.619 --> 06:30.146
What about the actual mission?
How long do you have to be in space?

06:30.223 --> 06:34.557
Five days, six if we get to blow up
an asteroid or something cool like that.

06:35.661 --> 06:36.992
Binford's OK with this?

06:37.063 --> 06:40.692
It's a promotion for the tools.
They think it's a great idea.

06:40.767 --> 06:44.100
Tim, I don't know.
This whole thing sounds kind of scary.

06:44.170 --> 06:49.039
If it makes you feel any better, I don't
think they'd let me drive anything or...

06:50.309 --> 06:53.676
- Six months. That's a long time.
- But think about it.

06:53.746 --> 06:57.182
But what about the kids?
Brad, he's gotta be visiting colleges.

06:57.250 --> 07:00.185
Randy's gonna be the editor
of the school newspaper.

07:00.253 --> 07:04.883
And God knows what's gonna be going on
with Mark for that entire six months.

07:04.957 --> 07:07.721
But it's a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

07:07.794 --> 07:12.026
- It's not like you can pass it up.
- So, let's recap.

07:13.933 --> 07:16.367
- Am I staying or going?
- Well, you gotta go.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.098
- Yes!
- It's a great adventure.

07:19.172 --> 07:22.733
I'm just gonna be the one stuck
with trying to make it all work here.

07:22.842 --> 07:27.211
Has anyone ever said you're the most
beautiful, understanding woman?

07:27.313 --> 07:31.272
Yeah, yeah, yeah. The guy who just
snuck out of here before you got home.

07:33.686 --> 07:35.654
Hi, Dad. Hi, Mom.

07:38.591 --> 07:40.559
Who was that?

09:11.083 --> 09:14.450
<i>I enjoy:
A: Taking a walk in a meadow.</i>

09:14.554 --> 09:17.318
<i>B: Reading a good book by the fire.</i>

09:17.423 --> 09:21.917
<i>Or C: Going on a rampage
with industrial farm equipment.</i>

09:29.602 --> 09:31.570
<i>A.</i>

09:35.041 --> 09:37.805
Well, that reminds me of Mother.

09:40.813 --> 09:42.178
Mother.

09:43.549 --> 09:45.073
Mother.

09:48.888 --> 09:52.051
A beautiful summer's day...

09:52.158 --> 09:54.922
ruined by Mother.

09:54.994 --> 09:59.488
Sometimes after an emergency bail-out,
the parachute will keep dragging you.

09:59.565 --> 10:02.056
The object of this exercise
is to see how fast

10:02.134 --> 10:04.602
you can disengage from your chute.

10:04.670 --> 10:07.503
- Yes?
- It's a bit snug in the crotch area.

10:07.573 --> 10:11.942
Further motivation
for you to unook quickly.

10:12.044 --> 10:13.375
And... go!

10:13.446 --> 10:16.279
Oh, yeah! Oh, boy!

10:16.349 --> 10:18.317
Hello!

10:19.685 --> 10:22.552
Oh, boy! Oh, yeah!

10:25.458 --> 10:29.019
I believe you guys
have got a couple of my personal items!

10:29.128 --> 10:30.425
Ouch!

10:38.571 --> 10:40.038
- Hey, Doc.
- Hello.

10:40.106 --> 10:42.802
Pretty cool stuff.
We gonna play a video game?

10:42.875 --> 10:46.038
Yes. It's called Space Probe.

10:49.615 --> 10:52.106
This is to test how many Gs
you can withstand.

10:52.184 --> 10:54.516
We'll start off with three Gs.

10:59.592 --> 11:02.891
This is great.
Hey, how about some more power?

11:02.962 --> 11:05.123
OK, eight Gs.

11:07.099 --> 11:11.468
All right! Everything's spinning.
Reminds me of when I was a kid.

11:11.537 --> 11:15.564
I love this!
All right, what do we do next?

11:16.375 --> 11:20.004
- The group photo.
- Great.

11:24.450 --> 11:27.681
We're gonna be sending you underwater
in this ain'tight suit

11:27.753 --> 11:31.189
so you can simulate
working with tools in space.

11:31.257 --> 11:33.623
- Any problems with the suit?
- Not at all.

11:33.726 --> 11:37.685
I probably shouldn't have had
that breakfast burrito. Whoo!

11:40.800 --> 11:42.961
Next we're gonna send you
up in a plane

11:43.035 --> 11:45.970
to see how you respond
in a zero-gravity environment.

11:47.073 --> 11:50.236
- Yes?
- This means that I will be weightless?

11:53.446 --> 11:55.937
They're astronauts, not magicians, Al.

11:59.919 --> 12:02.353
Watch this! Aaaagh!

12:02.421 --> 12:04.252
Watch out!

12:04.323 --> 12:08.419
You think that's something? You guys
think you can jump high? Watch this.

12:08.494 --> 12:10.462
Oh!

12:12.932 --> 12:16.993
You have a million similar poses here.
Why don't you throw some of these out?

12:17.069 --> 12:21.096
I can't. They're all just precious
family heirlooms.

12:21.173 --> 12:24.939
How about this one
of you pregnant and bending over?

12:26.178 --> 12:28.146
I wasrt pregnant.

12:31.684 --> 12:33.811
Well, I'm all set.

12:33.886 --> 12:35.854
All righty.

12:37.089 --> 12:40.422
- Wow.
- Whoa! Look at you!

12:40.493 --> 12:44.361
This girl must be something
if she can make you look halfway normal.

12:44.430 --> 12:47.524
From what Mark has said,
she is adorable. Her name is...

12:47.600 --> 12:50.262
Please, Mom.
It's bad enough they know my name.

12:51.670 --> 12:53.831
What time's Dad supposed to be back?

12:53.906 --> 12:58.673
Well, he's supposed to leave Houston
around midnight. I wonder how he did.

12:58.744 --> 13:02.271
Well, you don't actually think
he got chosen, do you?

13:03.182 --> 13:06.743
Are you kidding me?
There's psychological tests involved.

13:06.852 --> 13:08.945
- Hi, everybody.
- Hey.

13:09.021 --> 13:12.684
- What are you doing home so soon?
- I got an early flight. Missed you.

13:12.758 --> 13:15.226
- Me, too.
- Hey, look at you.

13:15.294 --> 13:18.263
You look like
one of the Brooks Brothers.

13:18.364 --> 13:21.492
- So what happened?
- Well, we got our test results early.

13:21.567 --> 13:23.728
I wanted to share it with the family.

13:23.836 --> 13:26.669
Oh, Tim. I'm sorry it didn't work out.

13:26.739 --> 13:31.039
<i>Au contraire. Binford's proud to present
Tim The Spaceman Taylor.</i>

13:31.110 --> 13:33.078
They picked me.

13:40.486 --> 13:44.217
I can't believe it. It's so amazing.
You are gonna be an astronaut.

13:44.290 --> 13:47.054
Yeah, it's gonna be great,
blasting off into space.

13:47.126 --> 13:49.594
Cruising at 17,000 miles an hour.

13:49.662 --> 13:53.621
All the while fighting
the gravitational pull of Al's mom.

13:57.102 --> 14:00.538
- When is the training gonna start?
- Next week.

14:01.307 --> 14:05.368
Oh, my God. I've gotta get organized.
I'm gonna have to make some schedules.

14:05.444 --> 14:08.607
While I'm gone,
you're the men around the house, OK?

14:08.714 --> 14:11.683
You'll have to do
what I normally do around here.

14:14.053 --> 14:17.181
Electrocute ourselves and irritate Mom?

14:18.057 --> 14:20.491
Those are big shoes to fill.

14:20.559 --> 14:23.528
We're up to the challenge.

14:26.999 --> 14:29.866
I can't believe
you're going up in space.

14:29.935 --> 14:32.267
That's what the other astronauts said.

14:35.374 --> 14:38.741
- You all right with this?
- Yeah. I'll be OK.

14:39.912 --> 14:42.278
- I'm gonna pay for this, aren't I?
- Oh, yeah.

14:43.382 --> 14:46.044
Thanks for breakfast.
I gotta go to the library.

14:46.118 --> 14:50.145
- One more kielbasa left. You want it?
- One more sausage, I'm gonna explode.

14:50.222 --> 14:53.191
- Is that a yes or a no?
- I'll see you later.

14:53.259 --> 14:54.988
- I'll save this for Mark.
- Bye.

14:55.060 --> 14:56.994
How did Mark's date go last night?

14:57.062 --> 14:59.360
He came in late and didn't say anything.

14:59.431 --> 15:04.801
Can I just make one point? Nobody's ever
seen the girl and she never came in.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.202
Are you saying the girl's not real?

15:07.273 --> 15:10.970
Who cares? Real or imaginary,
she's getting Mark out of the house.

15:14.079 --> 15:17.412
- Hey, Dad.
- Sorry. I tried to save you the saus...

15:20.019 --> 15:22.681
- What happened to you?
- Nothing.

15:22.755 --> 15:26.987
Well, something happened.
I'm not saying it's a bad thing.

15:27.059 --> 15:29.425
- Good.
- What happened to the Ivy League look?

15:29.528 --> 15:32.156
I thought your girlfriend
liked the preppy thing.

15:32.231 --> 15:36.531
She does. She just doesn't like me.
She dumped me, Dad.

15:36.602 --> 15:39.867
Ah. Hold on a minute.
Mark, Mark, Mark, wait, wait, wait.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.305
- What?
- I know this is hard to talk about.

15:42.374 --> 15:45.707
But if I go into space,
it'll be a long time before we can talk.

15:45.778 --> 15:49.339
- I'm fine with that.
- I'm not fine with that. I'm your dad.

15:49.415 --> 15:51.713
I wanna know what's wrong.
Come on, talk to me.

15:52.651 --> 15:54.710
- Nothing's going on.
- Sure there is.

15:54.787 --> 15:58.223
Every time a girl breaks up with you,
you gonna shave something?

15:58.290 --> 16:01.555
You'll quickly run out of options,
I'll tell you.

16:03.195 --> 16:06.358
This happens to a lot of kids.
I was just like you.

16:06.432 --> 16:09.560
Dad, you were nothing like me.
You were popular.

16:09.635 --> 16:13.401
With, you know, the car guys.
I wasrt popular with everybody.

16:13.505 --> 16:16.338
The intellectuals,
they thought I was a jock.

16:16.408 --> 16:19.104
- And the jocks thought I was...
- An intellectual?

16:19.178 --> 16:23.672
No. They thought I was uncoordinated.

16:23.749 --> 16:26.013
Dad, what does this have to do with me?

16:26.085 --> 16:30.454
What I'm trying to say is a lot of kids
your age feel like they don't fit in.

16:30.522 --> 16:34.481
And everybody gets rejected.
Believe me, other girls'll come along.

16:34.560 --> 16:38.121
Not like Kathy. You know, I even changed
the way I looked for her.

16:38.230 --> 16:41.461
You shouldn't change for anybody.
Get used to who you are.

16:41.533 --> 16:44.866
- That's never gone over big.
- I know how you feel.

16:44.937 --> 16:48.304
You don't know how I feel, Dad.
You don't know anything about me.

16:48.407 --> 16:53.037
- You don't know anything.
- Hey, Mark. Come on!

17:05.858 --> 17:07.826
What are you doing, Wilson?

17:07.925 --> 17:11.292
Well, Tim, I'm painting my dragon head
for the Moomba Festival.

17:12.598 --> 17:15.761
Aw, jeez. Is it Moomba time already?

17:15.834 --> 17:20.532
Oh, Tim. You know,
it's an Australian celebration.

17:20.606 --> 17:22.938
I am so excited about it.

17:23.008 --> 17:26.171
Probably not as excited as you are
about your space voyage.

17:26.278 --> 17:30.044
But there's a lot of things around
this house that aren't so exciting.

17:30.149 --> 17:32.413
Really? What happened?

17:33.819 --> 17:36.379
Mark's in a real funk over a girl.

17:36.455 --> 17:39.015
Well, Tim, he is entering adolescence.

17:39.091 --> 17:42.857
And if I remember mine correctly,
rejection comes with the territory.

17:42.961 --> 17:47.022
- But you didn't shave your head.
- Actually, I did.

17:47.099 --> 17:50.967
But I was living in Tibet
and I wanted to be like the cool kids.

17:51.937 --> 17:54.497
I think Mark's problem
is a little more serious.

17:54.573 --> 17:57.474
One minute he's a preppy,
the next minute he's bald.

17:57.543 --> 18:00.307
He yelled at me,
said I don't understand him at all.

18:00.379 --> 18:02.540
Whoa. Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

18:02.648 --> 18:06.209
It sounds like your youngest
is struggling with his self-image.

18:06.285 --> 18:09.448
While he's struggling,
I wonder if I should be leaving home.

18:09.521 --> 18:12.888
So you're torn between
the most exciting voyage of your life

18:12.991 --> 18:16.119
or staying home
and taking care of someone you love.

18:16.195 --> 18:19.687
- That's the question.
- Heed the words of Thornton Wilder.

18:19.765 --> 18:20.732
What did he say?

18:20.833 --> 18:25.099
Thornton Wilder said, "When one
is at home, he dreams of adventure."

18:25.170 --> 18:28.697
"And when one is on an adventure,
he dreams of home."

18:28.774 --> 18:31.538
That doesn't answer any questions.

18:31.643 --> 18:34.942
No, but it does restate it
in a very interesting way.

18:36.148 --> 18:39.379
I'm sorry, Tim. I mean,
giving up the chance to go into space,

18:39.451 --> 18:42.352
that would be a big sacrifice.

18:42.421 --> 18:45.185
On the other hand,
Mark has had a really rough year.

18:45.257 --> 18:46.690
Yes, he has.

18:46.758 --> 18:51.718
It is a difficult decision. Only you can
determine how much you need to be here.

18:51.797 --> 18:55.756
Yeah, yeah. Well, thanks, buddy.

18:55.868 --> 18:58.632
Enjoy your Dumbo Festival.

18:58.704 --> 19:00.638
It's a Moomba Festival.

19:00.706 --> 19:04.267
Moomba, Dumbo. As long as an elephant
flies, it's probably a lot of fun.

19:07.546 --> 19:09.639
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

19:09.715 --> 19:12.047
- Get everything done at the library?
- Yep.

19:12.117 --> 19:14.347
Now I gotta go work on those albums.

19:14.419 --> 19:17.388
Beat you to it.
Finished them up for you.

19:17.456 --> 19:21.483
- Holidays, birthdays, vacations.
- This is incredible.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.687
Honey!

19:23.762 --> 19:27.630
You have been so sweet ever since
you decided to go up in space.

19:27.699 --> 19:30.725
Well, you can kiss that goodbye
because I'm not going.

19:30.802 --> 19:33.862
What are you talking...?
Did they cancel the mission?

19:33.939 --> 19:39.070
No. I just decided there were just more
important things to do here at home.

19:40.379 --> 19:43.940
Tim, I promised you
I would take care of the cars.

19:46.952 --> 19:49.512
This isn't about the cars.

19:49.588 --> 19:51.556
Bye. I'm going to the mall.

19:54.293 --> 19:56.659
What is that?

19:56.728 --> 19:59.026
That's one of the reasons
I wanna stay home.

19:59.097 --> 20:02.157
His new girlfriend broke up with him,
so he shaves his head.

20:02.234 --> 20:03.724
He's back in black.

20:03.802 --> 20:07.294
I think that kid's problems
are deeper than a bad haircut.

20:07.372 --> 20:09.806
I am really worried about him.

20:09.875 --> 20:14.437
Well, you must be if you're gonna pass
up an opportunity to go on the shuttle.

20:14.513 --> 20:17.277
This is a very crucial time
in that boy's life.

20:17.349 --> 20:19.840
When I was his age,
my father had already died,

20:19.918 --> 20:22.182
and, boy, I wished he'd been around.

20:22.254 --> 20:24.415
Well, I know that was tough for you...

20:24.489 --> 20:27.185
But it's not just that.
It's the other boys, too.

20:27.259 --> 20:31.389
What if Brad starts smoking pot again?
What if Randy started doing that?

20:31.463 --> 20:34.899
This is not a good time
for me to leave the planet.

20:42.641 --> 20:46.304
You know, and there's other reasons
why this is a great decision.

20:46.378 --> 20:49.745
I can now finish the hot rod with Brad
like I promised him I'd do.

20:49.815 --> 20:52.283
And this summer
I can take Randy fly-fishing.

20:52.351 --> 20:54.319
We've always wanted to do that.

20:54.419 --> 20:56.944
And we'll get to have
a whole year together

20:57.022 --> 20:59.047
before Brad goes away to college.

20:59.124 --> 21:01.217
Yeah.

21:01.293 --> 21:04.558
Unless, of course,
they'd let me go up in the shuttle.

21:05.731 --> 21:08.165
- You're not a Binford employee.
- Hm.

21:08.233 --> 21:11.896
Besides, I checked out the facilities
on the space shuttle.

21:11.970 --> 21:15.235
I don't think you'd be too comfortable
pooping in a pouch.

21:19.945 --> 21:24.473
So, Tim, you're sure that you're OK
about not going into space?

21:24.549 --> 21:27.416
Absolutely.
What's a historic space flight

21:27.486 --> 21:30.819
compared with hanging out
with your hairless offspring?

21:32.658 --> 21:37.220
- You have no regrets?
- No. Why do you keep harping on this?

21:37.296 --> 21:40.754
I don't know. I just keep picking up
these little signals.

21:42.534 --> 21:44.866
I don't know what you're talking about.

21:46.138 --> 21:48.470
I'm gonna need
some more Tang, instantly.
