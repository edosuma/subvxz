00:40.219 --> 00:41.655
Type quieter, asshole.

00:42.802 --> 00:45.242
Early relief.
So get the fuck out of here.

00:45.910 --> 00:47.941
Jesus, Bunk.
What time is it?

00:48.196 --> 00:49.182
4:30.

00:49.575 --> 00:52.374
I couldn't sleep, so
get the fuck gone.

00:53.313 --> 00:55.107
what time did Mcnulty
leave last night?

00:55.267 --> 00:57.338
Never did.
He's in number one.

00:57.498 --> 00:59.583
Pulling his hair out
over some shit.

01:10.396 --> 01:12.240
Think again about what
the fuck you're doing.

01:12.400 --> 01:14.184
Bunk, this can work.

01:15.101 --> 01:16.066
It can.

01:16.444 --> 01:18.440
Fuck you. I mean that.

01:20.117 --> 01:21.741
4:00 in the fuckin' morning?

01:22.270 --> 01:23.541
Oh, so it is.

01:27.200 --> 01:28.622
All of these?

01:29.126 --> 01:30.913
Homeless murders
from the last 5 years.

01:31.913 --> 01:35.288
Everything before that is on microfilm,
but we got enough right here

01:35.828 --> 01:37.044
Most of it open.

01:37.204 --> 01:39.376
We don't do so well
with homeless kilings.

01:39.535 --> 01:41.611
Transient locales,
no nearest, no dearest.

01:41.771 --> 01:44.385
No one gives a fuck.
Cases stay open forever.

01:45.041 --> 01:47.805
- You're going to jail behind this shit.
- Yes, you are.

01:48.368 --> 01:50.308
You know what they do
to police in jail?

01:50.582 --> 01:52.560
Pretty police like yourself?
Motherfucker,

01:52.861 --> 01:55.033
We have kids.
Houses.

01:55.647 --> 01:57.197
Car payments.
Furniture.

01:58.053 --> 01:59.886
I just bought brand-new lawn chairs

02:00.046 --> 02:02.642
and a glass patio table.
You don't buy no shit like that if you

02:02.802 --> 02:04.517
plan to lose your job
and go to prison.

02:04.677 --> 02:06.861
- You won't even get past the m.e.
- Watch me.

02:07.021 --> 02:09.476
You're dumping murders on us
that we can't solve.

02:09.636 --> 02:13.010
- You're fucking our clearance rate.
- Fuck the fucking numbers already.

02:13.404 --> 02:15.625
The fucking numbers destroyed
this fucking department.

02:16.002 --> 02:18.334
Landsman and his clearance
rate can suck a hairy asshole.

02:18.494 --> 02:20.136
Marlo ain't worth it.
Nobody is.

02:20.296 --> 02:21.678
Marlo's an asshole.

02:22.433 --> 02:24.468
He does not get to win.
We get to win.

02:24.828 --> 02:26.079
This case doesn't go away

02:26.239 --> 02:28.513
just because the bosses
can't find the money to pay for it.

02:28.673 --> 02:32.050
These are fucking murders--
Ghetto murders, but still,

02:33.088 --> 02:35.078
I came back out of the western
to work this case

02:35.238 --> 02:36.811
because they said it would be worked.

02:36.971 --> 02:40.134
I came back out on a promise,
and they're gonna keep that promise.

02:40.694 --> 02:42.175
Whether they know it or not.

02:42.565 --> 02:43.779
I'm gonna tell landsman.

02:44.892 --> 02:46.616
Yeah. You keep on with it,

02:46.776 --> 02:48.242
I'm gonna rat you out.

02:49.369 --> 02:51.116
You do what you got to do.

02:55.158 --> 02:57.263
My name is
nowhere in the file.

02:57.423 --> 02:59.529
I don't want fuck to do with this.

03:04.126 --> 03:05.133
Hey, Bunk.

05:08.852 --> 05:10.268
What're you doing?

05:10.428 --> 05:13.285
Final is out.
I want to see my story.

05:13.445 --> 05:14.229
Now?

05:14.389 --> 05:16.278
It's my first time out front.
I want to see it.

05:16.540 --> 05:18.223
This is why we should
get home delivery.

05:18.383 --> 05:21.393
Why pay for it when I get
it for free at the office?

05:23.662 --> 05:24.715
Be back.

05:34.087 --> 05:35.293
Brother ray.

05:36.646 --> 05:37.895
God rest ye.

06:25.700 --> 06:27.130
When does the "sun" get here?

06:28.200 --> 06:29.548
Around now usually.

08:08.974 --> 08:11.027
- Anybody got a working car?
- I got one,

08:11.187 --> 08:13.962
but I'm going back out
to my crime scene for a canvass.

08:14.297 --> 08:15.613
Drop me at the m.e.?

08:18.863 --> 08:20.442
My office now.

08:23.405 --> 08:25.840
I'll get a lift over
from one of the central cars.

08:31.253 --> 08:33.732
This is way past any shit
you ever pulled in your life.

08:33.892 --> 08:35.802
- Think on it.
- You see Greggs out there,

08:36.441 --> 08:37.774
bagging evidence alone,

08:37.933 --> 08:39.794
then going back out
to recanvass on a triple?

08:39.953 --> 08:42.517
A triple fucking murder.
A home invasion,

08:43.106 --> 08:44.747
and she's working it alone.

08:44.907 --> 08:47.397
They pulled Crutchfield this morning,
put him back in the rotation.

08:47.557 --> 08:50.050
- That's on them, but you can't--
- Fucking right, that's on them.

08:50.210 --> 08:51.191
A triple murder,

08:51.351 --> 08:54.782
and 12 hours later
they leave one detective alone on it?

08:54.942 --> 08:56.634
I guess she's lucky
she has a car.

08:57.358 --> 08:59.753
- This shit won't work.
- Then we're no worse than before.

09:00.201 --> 09:03.103
- Extra red name or two on the board.
- Yeah, unless you got caught.

09:03.263 --> 09:05.165
Who in this fucking unit
is gonna catch me?

09:05.325 --> 09:08.251
Most of the guys up here couldn't catch
the clap in a mexican whorehouse.

09:09.780 --> 09:11.172
What's with the red ribbon?

09:12.340 --> 09:16.047
Barlow had an open strangle
a few years back.

09:16.723 --> 09:19.179
Homeless guy with a red ribbon
tied around his wrist.

09:19.587 --> 09:20.881
So that's two.

09:21.211 --> 09:25.137
Also, I found an open homeless
case which Ray Cole worked.

09:25.700 --> 09:28.281
I wrote a ribbon
into his office reports.

09:28.516 --> 09:31.527
- So there's 3.
- Our guy didn't have a red ribbon.

09:34.168 --> 09:35.967
- That's where I'm headed.
- Jesus.

09:37.499 --> 09:39.325
- Listen to yourself.
- Upstairs

09:39.485 --> 09:42.322
wouldn't jump on a real serial killer--
fuckin' Marlo,

09:42.482 --> 09:44.249
who's got bodies all over hi

09:44.409 --> 09:45.882
maybe they need the make-believe.

09:46.042 --> 09:48.614
Yeah, maybe you're the asshole
just lost his fucking mind.

10:05.031 --> 10:07.066
- Crutchfield.
- Yeah, I'm locked in the box.

10:07.226 --> 10:09.309
- In the box?
- It's no joke. Let me out.

10:09.469 --> 10:10.630
Be right there.

10:17.667 --> 10:18.698
He fuck you?

10:20.563 --> 10:21.594
He tried...

10:23.276 --> 10:24.996
But mostly he just fucks himself.

10:29.239 --> 10:31.215
You ain't seen those yet, huh?

10:31.375 --> 10:33.004
I'll bet you didn't.

10:33.276 --> 10:36.484
Fucking Burrell's asshole
must be so tight

10:37.019 --> 10:40.223
you couldn't pull a pin from it
with a John Deere tractor.

10:41.392 --> 10:44.396
Here you're promising
a double-digit drop,

10:44.793 --> 10:46.059
and he gives you

10:46.514 --> 10:48.049
a 4% bump

10:48.430 --> 10:50.022
for two quarters in a row.

10:50.182 --> 10:51.742
Thanks for bringing these by, Stan.

10:51.949 --> 10:53.923
Well, I wanted to
give you a heads up.

10:54.844 --> 10:57.529
Truth is,
looking at numbers like those,

10:58.014 --> 11:00.610
I'm thinking you could do a lot worse

11:00.865 --> 11:03.619
than give me a run
as acting commissioner.

11:04.243 --> 11:05.936
I know you couldn't make me permanent.

11:06.477 --> 11:07.832
maybe 6 months

11:08.293 --> 11:11.342
while you keep grooming
your boy Daniels.

11:12.739 --> 11:14.326
I'd get a pension bump,

11:14.735 --> 11:18.208
and you'd get a head start
on clearing out deadwood,

11:18.611 --> 11:21.727
beginning with Burrell
and Rawls.

11:22.376 --> 11:25.058
Thanks, Stan.
Let me think on it.

11:25.737 --> 11:27.097
You do that, Tommy.

11:35.866 --> 11:38.301
Even on an acting basis,
can you imagine

11:38.461 --> 11:42.316
Nerese and the Ministers dealing
with commissioner Valchek?

11:43.492 --> 11:45.183
What are you gonna do
about the numbers?

11:45.343 --> 11:48.684
Fuck can I do? I cut the department
budget to the bone, right?

11:49.020 --> 11:51.351
Can't very well complain
when the crime rate bumps.

11:51.680 --> 11:54.504
Burrell comes in here
and owns these,

11:54.817 --> 11:56.119
I got to give him a pass--

11:56.279 --> 11:58.508
at least until I can fix
his money problems.

12:02.429 --> 12:04.572
Your piece took a bad bite there.

12:04.732 --> 12:06.377
35 inches down to 12?

12:06.633 --> 12:09.784
Yeah, well, it's my fault
for giving it up to the a-section.

12:10.097 --> 12:11.771
Page one editor made
noises like it was

12:11.931 --> 12:13.640
gonna go out front. Then he...

12:13.800 --> 12:16.412
ossed it back to metro
before the double-dot.

12:16.756 --> 12:19.321
Night editor didn't have room
to take it back, so...

12:19.858 --> 12:21.613
Story deserved better. Sorry.

12:23.078 --> 12:24.891
3 people murdered in a house,

12:25.121 --> 12:27.468
and it gets 12 inches below the fold.

12:28.341 --> 12:30.717
- Explain that to me.
- There's no explaining it.

12:31.103 --> 12:32.251
Advertising's down,

12:32.742 --> 12:35.052
we got a smaller news hole,
we're not managing it well.

12:35.534 --> 12:36.785
We messed up.

12:37.227 --> 12:38.302
That's all.

12:44.158 --> 12:45.299
Wrong zip code.

12:46.392 --> 12:48.251
They're dead where it doesn't count.

12:48.821 --> 12:51.289
If they were white
and murdered in Tmonium,

12:51.449 --> 12:53.079
you'd have had 30 inches off the front.

12:53.239 --> 12:55.775
Would have been my first front-pager
where I didn't share a byline.

12:56.424 --> 12:57.359
Yeah?

12:58.866 --> 13:02.615
I drove down to the port covington plant
this morning to get a copy.

13:02.775 --> 13:04.825
Well, you ain't the first to do that.

13:07.547 --> 13:09.334
Our 10-7 on e floor yet?

13:09.494 --> 13:11.232
He's by the overhead camera.

13:11.837 --> 13:13.584
I need to grab prints,
get him I.D.ed.

13:13.744 --> 13:16.709
Don't you want to wait for the post,
keep his hands clean for trace?

13:16.869 --> 13:19.882
I need to know who my victim is.
That's the priority.

13:20.876 --> 13:23.511
Finish your breakfast.
I got plenty of time.

14:09.995 --> 14:12.540
There's nothing under the nails
that I can see.

14:12.700 --> 14:14.323
I think we can risk prints.

14:29.799 --> 14:30.788
Something's up.

14:31.686 --> 14:33.040
Please. Gather around.

14:35.631 --> 14:38.504
Steve, could someone get word
across the hall to features and sports?

14:38.664 --> 14:40.171
We want everyone on this.

14:48.716 --> 14:50.487
What, did we get sold again?

14:51.316 --> 14:53.682
First the "L.A. Times" buys us up,
then the "Tribune."

14:53.842 --> 14:54.854
Law of the fish.

14:55.184 --> 14:57.400
- We're the minnow.
- Maybe we won a Pulitzer.

14:57.560 --> 14:59.285
Pulitzers are still a week away.

14:59.445 --> 15:00.813
It just turned April.

15:02.422 --> 15:03.945
Look at Whiting's pants.

15:04.747 --> 15:08.670
If we won a Pulitzer,
the executive editor would be tumescent.

15:09.446 --> 15:10.481
Toom-what?

15:10.641 --> 15:12.664
Speak English.
I'm just a police reporter.

15:12.823 --> 15:14.794
Tumescent. Engorged.

15:15.281 --> 15:16.331
Exactly.

15:16.491 --> 15:19.932
It's a bad time for newspapers,
as you all know.

15:20.914 --> 15:22.663
The news hole is shrinking

15:23.233 --> 15:26.050
as advertising dollars
continue to decline.

15:26.503 --> 15:29.597
Our circulation numbers
are also down as we compete with a

15:30.055 --> 15:31.503
variety of media.

15:32.083 --> 15:34.695
Technology is driving distribution,

15:36.428 --> 15:37.678
and the Internet

15:38.287 --> 15:41.088
is a free source of news and opinions.

15:41.421 --> 15:44.273
Seeking a balance in this new world,

15:45.458 --> 15:47.421
we're now faced with hard choices.

15:48.359 --> 15:52.447
We opened our first foreign
bureau in London in 1924.

15:53.147 --> 15:57.769
The "Sun's" foreign coverage
has been a source of pride ever since.

15:59.979 --> 16:01.361
So it is with

16:02.963 --> 16:04.337
tremendous regret

16:05.785 --> 16:09.494
that I tell you that Chicago
has made it clear that the bureaus

16:09.800 --> 16:10.990
in Beijing,

16:11.516 --> 16:15.488
Moscow, Jerusalem,
Johannesburg, and London

16:16.148 --> 16:17.593
will all be shuttered.

16:19.327 --> 16:21.084
Elsewhere in the newsroom,

16:22.093 --> 16:24.194
there will be
a fresh round of buyouts.

16:25.243 --> 16:27.532
Chicago has given us some specific

16:27.774 --> 16:29.015
budgetary targets

16:29.409 --> 16:31.743
that will require some hard choices

16:31.903 --> 16:33.575
throughout the newsroom.

16:33.961 --> 16:35.497
We are, quite simply,

16:36.737 --> 16:39.959
going to have to find ways
to do more with less.

16:40.414 --> 16:43.255
So I guess I will
turn this over to tom,

16:43.802 --> 16:45.799
who will get into the specifics.

16:48.327 --> 16:49.800
I know some of you have questions.

16:49.960 --> 16:52.598
If you could hold them for me
until after I've had a chance to speak.

16:52.949 --> 16:55.159
Pull your clipbook together.
Time to find a new home.

16:55.319 --> 16:56.581
Chicago has sent us a memo

16:56.741 --> 16:58.854
outlining options that are
available to those of you...

16:59.142 --> 17:02.074
The aorta should have elasticity to it,

17:02.234 --> 17:03.317
t it's rock hard.

17:03.649 --> 17:07.021
Whoever strangled him could've
just waited a month or two more.

17:07.457 --> 17:08.823
This guy was on his last legs.

17:09.281 --> 17:10.488
It is what it is.

17:10.982 --> 17:13.198
In addition to the fractured hyoid
and the bruising,

17:13.358 --> 17:15.281
I got signs of a struggle
around the body,

17:15.518 --> 17:16.777
a couple witnesses

17:16.936 --> 17:19.893
who thought they heard sounds
of a struggle inside the house.

17:20.571 --> 17:22.700
Also that ribbon you snipped off,

17:23.482 --> 17:24.789
it might tie to other cases.

17:24.949 --> 17:27.523
The ribbon my own investigator
missed at the scene.

17:27.684 --> 17:30.079
It happens.
It was high on the wrist.

17:31.255 --> 17:34.170
Cause and manner
is homicide by strangulation.

17:35.176 --> 17:36.800
Good hunting, detective.

17:40.598 --> 17:42.583
"and anyone requiring
additional information

17:42.743 --> 17:45.216
"on cobra benefits
and pension payout as part

17:45.375 --> 17:47.193
"of the voluntary separation plan

17:47.738 --> 17:50.588
can schedule an appointment
with human resources."

17:51.063 --> 17:53.326
Some of you will migrate
into new positions

17:53.486 --> 17:55.260
while others will of course

17:55.940 --> 17:58.547
be moving on to other opportunities
beyond the Sun,

17:58.707 --> 18:01.712
but everyone in this room
has done excellent work

18:02.247 --> 18:04.704
and should be proud
of their contributions.

18:06.760 --> 18:09.356
- How many buyouts are there?
- That hasn't been determined yet.

18:09.516 --> 18:11.209
We're talking to the union later today.

18:11.369 --> 18:14.790
How'll this affect the upcoming contract
negotiations with the guild?

18:14.950 --> 18:17.142
Badly.
Kiss any raise good-bye.

18:17.562 --> 18:20.688
How come there's cuts in the newsroom
when the company's still profitable?

18:20.938 --> 18:23.147
There's nobody that feels
worse about this than I do.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.555
I've seen the excellent work
we've done here in Baltimore.

18:26.894 --> 18:29.236
The sooner we start
meeting with you individually,

18:29.396 --> 18:31.782
the sooner I can answer
all of your questions.

18:36.574 --> 18:38.689
- Not O'mara.
- Yeah.

18:39.282 --> 18:40.349
Aw, no.

18:42.287 --> 18:43.603
Good luck everybody.

18:44.646 --> 18:47.651
No increase in felonies
and a 1% bump in total crime.

18:52.053 --> 18:53.523
Do you vouch for these figures?

18:54.004 --> 18:55.554
- Sir?
- No increase in crime

18:55.714 --> 18:58.657
even after I cut you guys to the bone.
This is what you're telling me?

18:58.817 --> 19:00.722
Because the one thing I'm
asking of you guys--

19:00.882 --> 19:03.189
the one thing
that I'm asking above all--

19:03.349 --> 19:04.983
is that you bring me clean numbers.

19:05.822 --> 19:08.717
Yes, Mr. Mayor.
You made that clear.

19:11.671 --> 19:12.834
Very good then.

19:26.306 --> 19:27.390
Burrell is done.

19:27.789 --> 19:30.625
He just killed himself.
We leak the real stats,

19:30.785 --> 19:32.865
hold the cooked ones
in case he won't go quietly.

19:33.025 --> 19:34.457
And replace him with who?

19:34.865 --> 19:37.525
Rawls?
He came in with the same stats.

19:37.800 --> 19:40.091
If I know Bill Rawls,
he'll be calling over here as

19:40.251 --> 19:42.032
soon as he gets back to his office,

19:42.192 --> 19:44.318
telling us he warned Burrell
against cooking the books.

19:44.600 --> 19:47.817
The ministers won't live with Rawls.
Neither will Nerese.

19:47.977 --> 19:50.994
As acting commissioner,
they will for a few months at least

19:51.214 --> 19:53.020
if we've got a black
candidate to sell them.

19:53.180 --> 19:54.268
Daniels isn't ready.

19:54.428 --> 19:55.908
He's only been Colonel for a year.

19:56.068 --> 19:57.771
A year will do in a pinch.

19:59.954 --> 20:02.586
You float it with one of your
bunkies on Calvert street.

20:03.003 --> 20:04.204
See how it plays.

20:04.364 --> 20:07.098
Burrell reads that,
he'll shit melons.

20:07.258 --> 20:08.421
I fucking hope so.

20:09.325 --> 20:10.597
It's Baltimore.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.681
No one lives forever.

20:30.624 --> 20:31.785
Andreas, right?

20:34.890 --> 20:36.162
The Russian sent me.

20:39.163 --> 20:40.918
Need you to get a word to Vondas.

20:41.335 --> 20:42.739
He got a new friend.

20:43.222 --> 20:44.583
I never hear the name.

20:45.221 --> 20:47.298
Just let him know Marlo
came past with a gift.

20:51.212 --> 20:52.841
Be at you same time tomorrow.

21:11.812 --> 21:13.695
Any idea how long this could take?

21:14.504 --> 21:16.698
Don't know.
Might be here all day.

21:17.436 --> 21:19.326
I have meetings scheduled.

21:19.857 --> 21:22.122
We've got to lay
the foundation carefully,

21:22.282 --> 21:23.957
make it so the grand jurors understand

21:24.117 --> 21:27.168
all the ins and outs
so they don't get lost in the details.

21:32.285 --> 21:33.502
Mr. Howard?

21:39.932 --> 21:41.683
Is there any way
I could go earlier?

21:42.218 --> 21:44.101
If you're important enough, sure.

21:45.182 --> 21:48.480
I'm the vice president
of a major financial institution.

21:49.435 --> 21:50.842
Who the fuck isn't?

21:53.959 --> 21:56.789
Now, sir, directing your attention
to the document in your hand,

21:56.949 --> 21:58.778
is that also an account statement?

21:59.120 --> 22:00.143
Yes, it is,

22:00.422 --> 22:02.528
for a non-profit,
interest-bearing account,

22:02.879 --> 22:05.877
organizational,
with 5013 designation.

22:06.317 --> 22:10.461
Can begin by slowly
explaining in the most basic terms

22:10.621 --> 22:14.909
each of those things,
beginning with the word non-profit?

22:15.646 --> 22:18.201
- Hey, is box two open?
- Not yet.

22:18.361 --> 22:19.576
What about 3?

22:19.736 --> 22:21.723
Someone's killing homeless men.

22:22.647 --> 22:24.490
Medical examiner says so.

22:31.848 --> 22:33.931
Weird thing about my case, Bunk?

22:35.836 --> 22:38.990
Dead man was homeless,
but he had a red ribbon

22:39.633 --> 22:40.777
tied around his wrist.

22:40.937 --> 22:42.871
What does a homeless guy
have to remember

22:43.031 --> 22:45.708
that he should have a red ribbon
tied around his wrist?

22:49.774 --> 22:51.177
- Burlow.
- What?

22:51.833 --> 22:52.754
Nice out.

22:52.996 --> 22:55.925
Oh, like Chanel no. 5
comes out of your ass, moreland.

23:01.144 --> 23:04.010
If you got a problem,
then I got a problem.

23:04.456 --> 23:06.255
That's how the co-op work.

23:07.077 --> 23:08.507
What's the problem?

23:08.667 --> 23:10.197
I got too much money.

23:11.370 --> 23:15.131
Son, believe me,
you ain't alone.

23:16.863 --> 23:19.437
What to do with the shit
we sell ain't no thing.

23:19.930 --> 23:23.244
In Baltimore,
dope and coke sell themselves,

23:23.604 --> 23:25.417
but the money that come back?

23:26.668 --> 23:28.577
Ain't enough mattresses, is there now?

23:29.492 --> 23:30.709
You got any ideas?

23:33.348 --> 23:34.401
A few.

23:35.586 --> 23:36.661
If you askin'.

23:38.541 --> 23:40.370
- Not Twigg.
- Damn.

23:40.843 --> 23:43.544
Guy gives 20 years to the paper,
and this how it ends?

23:44.117 --> 23:46.500
Fact of the matter is,
it's more profitable these days

23:46.660 --> 23:48.560
to run a worse paper for less money.

23:48.990 --> 23:50.563
Cut back people and pages,

23:50.773 --> 23:51.962
you increase revenue.

23:52.122 --> 23:54.192
If we're lucky,
they'll just get rid of deadwood.

23:57.067 --> 23:58.153
How'd it go?

24:00.623 --> 24:02.210
"You've done excellent work."

24:02.784 --> 24:04.956
Without being explicit,
they gave me a choice--

24:05.747 --> 24:07.872
either the copy desk or the buyout.

24:08.032 --> 24:09.666
- You're kidding, right?
- Apparently,

24:09.826 --> 24:11.633
they can hire
one-and-a-half 20-somethings

24:11.793 --> 24:13.739
for what it costs to keep
me in print, so...

24:14.206 --> 24:15.479
Damn, Roger.

24:16.235 --> 24:18.091
- Sorry, man.
- Fuck it.

24:18.452 --> 24:21.128
I might as well get to work
on the Great American Novel.

24:27.170 --> 24:28.552
Gus, come on in.

24:43.694 --> 24:44.755
Have a seat.

24:48.104 --> 24:50.648
Relax, gus.
We need you here.

24:57.236 --> 24:58.507
We value your dedication.

24:59.058 --> 25:00.551
You've done excellent work.

25:00.711 --> 25:03.281
We're counting on you
to transition the new team.

25:03.786 --> 25:05.841
There's still going to be
excellent talent out there

25:06.001 --> 25:09.017
- that needs to be developed.
- What kind of team's going to be left?

25:09.572 --> 25:11.131
We're losing good people,

25:11.291 --> 25:13.855
but we expect to retain
the core of a solid staff.

25:14.630 --> 25:16.188
Doing more with less.

25:17.087 --> 25:19.820
That's what we have
to contemplate going forward.

25:20.507 --> 25:21.986
More with less, huh?

25:23.126 --> 25:24.354
Look at this.

25:25.061 --> 25:27.387
A red ribbon in one
of Ray Cole's files.

25:30.540 --> 25:33.072
Cole left a note with it.
"Found on left wrist of victim.

25:33.232 --> 25:35.002
Check against other cases."

25:36.539 --> 25:37.546
Hey, hon.

25:37.706 --> 25:40.338
How's the stain look on the cabinets?
They dry yet?

25:41.532 --> 25:43.856
Great.
I'm on my way.

26:03.628 --> 26:06.722
This is the hard part,
getting these guys to give a shit.

26:07.285 --> 26:09.128
Let's get a taste. I'm buying.

26:11.707 --> 26:13.214
You think I'm drinking with you?

26:13.633 --> 26:14.573
Go home, Jimmy.

26:14.733 --> 26:17.211
- Think your weak shit through, man.
- Go home?

26:17.512 --> 26:19.672
For the love of God,
I'm working a serial killer.

26:31.768 --> 26:33.186
You want to talk on it?

26:39.367 --> 26:41.034
Went with Chris and them,

26:42.613 --> 26:44.259
set up on this family.

26:51.043 --> 26:52.820
Everything so serious now.

26:55.497 --> 26:57.362
Yo, little man, you
finish your howork?

26:58.000 --> 26:59.130
'cause it's late now,

26:59.290 --> 27:01.523
and it's only gonna get later
if we don't roll home soon.

27:01.683 --> 27:02.930
Ain't no school tomorrow.

27:03.090 --> 27:04.341
Teacher meetings.

27:05.231 --> 27:06.845
We should do something, mike.

27:08.903 --> 27:10.265
Got my corner to run.

27:12.564 --> 27:13.552
What?

27:14.460 --> 27:15.644
What, nigga?

27:17.443 --> 27:19.000
Six Flags be open again.

27:23.305 --> 27:25.060
That shit's taking forever.

27:26.620 --> 27:28.447
Complicated stuff, I suppose.

27:28.607 --> 27:30.982
It's more like
Joe make it complicated.

27:31.142 --> 27:33.147
That nigga got a thing
for conversation.

27:34.569 --> 27:35.842
Not like Marlo.

27:37.595 --> 27:38.889
Definitely not.

27:41.140 --> 27:42.742
Now, see, pastor here,

27:42.902 --> 27:45.414
he one of about 3
I like to give money to.

27:45.723 --> 27:47.752
Help with his good works
and all that.

27:47.912 --> 27:49.048
Good works?

27:49.293 --> 27:53.147
He down with all kind of missionary work
going on down in the islands.

27:53.670 --> 27:55.810
You know,
building a church for some folk,

27:56.295 --> 27:57.948
a schoolhouse for some other folks,

27:58.109 --> 27:59.815
all kind of good shit like that.

27:59.975 --> 28:01.314
And what else y'all building?

28:01.716 --> 28:03.946
- A hospital.
- Hospital, yeah.

28:05.651 --> 28:08.514
Except they been building that mess
for about 10 years now,

28:08.674 --> 28:10.515
and nothing ever actually get finished.

28:10.881 --> 28:12.212
How you gonna clean my money?

28:12.372 --> 28:14.848
Got accounts at some
of the banks down there.

28:15.218 --> 28:16.951
Donations come in as cash,

28:17.996 --> 28:19.574
cashier's checks come out.

28:19.858 --> 28:21.338
Tiny-ass Caribbean island

28:21.498 --> 28:23.465
don't truck with no subpoenas,
no court orders,

28:23.625 --> 28:25.842
- none of that.
- You pay 10 on the dollar.

28:26.002 --> 28:28.716
Anything beyond that
depends on your generosity,

28:28.956 --> 28:31.222
to save those who want to be saved.

28:59.512 --> 29:00.675
I'm back.

29:01.346 --> 29:02.640
I can see that.

29:11.290 --> 29:12.212
Again.

29:15.111 --> 29:17.155
I saw your text message
on my cell phone today,

29:17.315 --> 29:19.459
it took me a minute remember
who the hell you were.

29:19.619 --> 29:21.366
- It ain't been that long.
- Shit.

29:22.210 --> 29:24.703
When you left,
I was still covering the labor beat.

29:24.863 --> 29:27.116
We ain't had a labor reporter
around here in 3 years.

29:27.276 --> 29:30.274
Yeah, well, now you the big,
bad city editor,

29:30.434 --> 29:33.210
I'm whoring myself for politicians.

29:34.132 --> 29:36.164
You got out
just at the right time, too.

29:36.540 --> 29:39.148
- That bad, huh?
- Chicago is killing us.

29:39.581 --> 29:41.380
One buyout after another.

29:42.733 --> 29:44.630
I can't even begin to think
what our next round

29:44.790 --> 29:47.053
of guild negotiations is gonna be like.

29:47.975 --> 29:49.510
Enough of me crying.

29:50.691 --> 29:52.723
What are you selling tonight,
dear Norman?

29:53.684 --> 29:55.933
Carcetti's planning
to shitcan Burrell.

29:56.265 --> 29:59.062
He's talking to people and
considering replacements.

29:59.408 --> 30:00.563
City hall source?

30:02.426 --> 30:03.733
Who's the leading candidate?

30:03.950 --> 30:07.490
Rawls, deputy for operations,
might have the job for a few months,

30:07.994 --> 30:10.616
but there's a front runner
from deeper in the department.

30:10.776 --> 30:12.082
Cedric Daniels.

30:12.242 --> 30:14.535
It's been a while since
I've been on the street there, Orman.

30:14.695 --> 30:15.830
Who's this Daniels?

30:15.990 --> 30:17.550
Chief of detectives.
Polished.

30:17.710 --> 30:18.937
Holds a law degree.

30:19.097 --> 30:21.351
Brought closure
to some high-level cases.

30:21.511 --> 30:25.297
His ex-wife got herself
elected to the council last go-round.

30:26.323 --> 30:29.052
I always liked photos
with my stories.

30:32.176 --> 30:33.667
And this is aimed at who?

30:34.506 --> 30:36.020
The ministers?
Nerese?

30:37.311 --> 30:40.259
You want to see if they can live
with this fella here, right?

30:41.334 --> 30:42.321
A- ight.

30:44.177 --> 30:45.818
From one whore to another.

30:54.826 --> 30:57.538
What the fuck?
Check this shit out.

30:59.212 --> 31:00.262
Beautiful.

31:00.594 --> 31:03.313
Holy shit.
Look at this motherfucker.

31:04.578 --> 31:06.004
Hit him with the spot.

31:14.933 --> 31:16.724
C.I.d. Figures, don't it?

31:30.913 --> 31:32.319
Where y'all need to go?

31:32.479 --> 31:33.533
Down Six Flags.

31:33.845 --> 31:35.285
You talkin' round trip?

31:36.283 --> 31:38.060
Run you two hundred plus gas.

31:39.316 --> 31:40.435
Where you at?

31:44.995 --> 31:48.548
I got 150, gas included
if it even get us there.

31:48.778 --> 31:52.218
Don't be fretting on the ride now.
This motherfucker tried and true.

31:54.189 --> 31:55.285
A- ight.

31:56.311 --> 31:58.891
I got half when we get there
and half on the way back.

32:05.224 --> 32:07.287
I guess you're not up for a story.

32:09.439 --> 32:12.402
- I need something worked on right away.
- What do you got?

32:12.562 --> 32:14.785
Mayor's thinking
about firing the police commissioner.

32:14.945 --> 32:16.692
He's floating the idea anyway.

32:16.852 --> 32:18.337
No problem. I'm all over it.

32:18.497 --> 32:20.018
What do you know about Daniels?

32:22.409 --> 32:24.119
- Who is he?
- C.I.D. Commander.

32:24.494 --> 32:25.919
Came out of the eastern D.E.U.

32:26.079 --> 32:29.380
married to the Daniels
that won the council seat in '06.

32:29.540 --> 32:31.412
Brought in a couple
of big wiretap cases,

32:31.572 --> 32:34.334
they gave him the western,
hoping to clean up that district

32:34.494 --> 32:36.419
after they shitcanned Bunny Colvin.

32:36.579 --> 32:39.642
Since getting separated, he's been
shacked up with Ronnie Pearlman

32:39.802 --> 32:41.711
over at the state's attorney's office.

32:41.871 --> 32:43.436
No suction early in his career,

32:43.596 --> 32:45.563
but now that he's got Carcetti's ear,

32:45.723 --> 32:47.519
now the brass stay out of his way.

32:47.886 --> 32:49.926
What's the man's favorite color?

32:56.987 --> 32:58.078
You sure?

32:58.311 --> 33:00.833
Yeah, what the hell?
I'm already on the clock.

33:11.125 --> 33:13.050
- Ops bureau.
- Hi, darlin'.

33:13.496 --> 33:15.804
It's Roger Twigg
with the Sunpapers.

33:16.062 --> 33:17.696
- Hey, roger.
- Is the deputy around?

33:17.856 --> 33:19.454
- Sure.
- Thanks, hon.

33:20.676 --> 33:22.603
An hour or two,
I'd have had it surrounded.

33:22.763 --> 33:23.862
No doubt.

33:24.973 --> 33:27.869
While Mr. Deadwood here's
working the story,

33:29.002 --> 33:31.529
see if you can feed him
some react quotes.

33:34.206 --> 33:36.351
It's a generous gift, but...

33:37.690 --> 33:40.077
your money,
the money you bring me,

33:40.843 --> 33:41.871
I don't need.

33:42.162 --> 33:43.423
Money is money.

33:45.383 --> 33:47.533
What's the difference
who bring it to you?

33:52.368 --> 33:53.674
It's dirty money.

33:55.375 --> 33:56.450
It stinks.

33:58.496 --> 34:01.370
- We ain't in the same business?
- The bills are from the street.

34:01.621 --> 34:03.639
They're dirty, you understand?

34:04.934 --> 34:06.438
Everything runs through joe.

34:06.856 --> 34:09.574
Everything is clean with Joe.

34:11.726 --> 34:12.902
Ain't a problem.

34:13.603 --> 34:15.820
Good.
Good-bye.

34:27.766 --> 34:28.687
Hey, Bunk.

34:29.271 --> 34:32.204
What kind of knot
you say was on that red ribbon?

34:32.540 --> 34:34.137
The one on the homeless guy's wrist.

34:34.297 --> 34:36.645
Ck yourself with your red ribbon.

34:38.824 --> 34:40.253
Just thought of something.

34:40.413 --> 34:43.514
I caught a vagrant months back had
a red ribbon tied around his wrist.

34:43.737 --> 34:45.197
You remember that?

34:45.938 --> 34:48.103
Hell of a catch, detective.
Hell of a catch.

34:48.460 --> 34:49.842
Can I see your file?

34:57.525 --> 34:58.672
Clean bills?

34:59.189 --> 35:00.834
You mean laundered, right?

35:02.028 --> 35:03.370
I just showed you how.

35:03.530 --> 35:04.871
Naw. He mean clean,

35:05.031 --> 35:07.287
like the money straight out
the bank and shit.

35:07.448 --> 35:10.210
- All lookin' nice.
- See, people ain't right.

35:10.370 --> 35:12.250
Here you are tryin'
to pay a motherfucker,

35:12.410 --> 35:14.590
an' all he worried about
is what the money look like.

35:14.750 --> 35:17.571
Normally, my fee for this
would be 20 on the dollar.

35:18.020 --> 35:19.572
40,000 to make it look nice.

35:19.732 --> 35:21.513
You need this back today, too.

35:22.464 --> 35:24.505
Might ordinarily charge more,

35:25.063 --> 35:28.229
but seeing as how we co-op,
no charge.

35:30.805 --> 35:32.109
Speaking of co-op,

35:32.269 --> 35:33.901
tell them niggas that got burnt

35:34.292 --> 35:36.457
I'm givin' away 50
for a line on Omar's people.

35:36.617 --> 35:40.705
His sister, his me-maw
some faggy he be with.

35:41.161 --> 35:42.743
All that shit count, you hear me?

35:42.903 --> 35:45.898
- I'd let sleeping dogs lie, son.
- Oh, I know you would, Joe.

35:46.384 --> 35:47.905
You smart like that.

35:48.956 --> 35:49.749
Me?

35:50.728 --> 35:52.521
Anyway, pass that offer on.

35:52.915 --> 35:54.846
Come back for this here in an hour.

36:04.406 --> 36:05.931
Boy want omar bad.

36:06.380 --> 36:08.457
I ain't giving him a thing on Omar.

36:09.390 --> 36:10.794
Omar been gone.

36:11.916 --> 36:14.472
Took a lot
of bad history with him, too.

36:15.149 --> 36:18.172
Why in the hell would I want
that motherfucker back?

36:18.832 --> 36:21.106
How fast you think we were
going on that first drop?

36:21.266 --> 36:23.117
- 75 an hour.
- That's it?

36:23.277 --> 36:25.443
Felt like I was coming out
of my seat, man.

36:25.603 --> 36:27.329
You always knowing
stuff like that. How?

36:27.489 --> 36:29.065
Ooh, over there!

36:34.446 --> 36:35.839
Y'all throwin' some bricks.

36:37.307 --> 36:38.997
Put a little touch on it.

36:40.566 --> 36:41.702
Watch.

36:48.403 --> 36:50.937
Put some backspin on it, or else
it'll bank off the box and not in it.

36:56.616 --> 36:57.610
Hold this.

36:57.931 --> 37:00.238
- So where Fairfax at?
- Northern Virginia.

37:00.399 --> 37:02.706
- How about you?
- I live up Baltimore.

37:02.866 --> 37:05.430
That's so cool.
You two have your own place?

37:06.243 --> 37:08.601
- Yeah, and Bug.
- That's tight.

37:35.306 --> 37:37.150
Madman on the loose, huh?

37:37.499 --> 37:39.402
3 linked cases and counting.

37:40.884 --> 37:42.727
He's killing vagrants, is he?

37:50.077 --> 37:51.832
Don't say I didn't warn you.

37:55.719 --> 37:58.479
Who covers us for the
Sunpapers nowadays? Twigg?

37:58.639 --> 38:01.534
Him or this new girl.
Alma something.

38:09.059 --> 38:10.967
Baltimore Sun. Gutierrez.

38:24.857 --> 38:27.238
Ok. Can I meet you?

38:28.598 --> 38:30.353
Do you know Al Pacino's?

38:31.359 --> 38:32.806
How about half an hour?

38:33.674 --> 38:35.075
Ok. See you then.

38:35.707 --> 38:38.121
Good react quote from
me in metro write.

38:43.890 --> 38:45.272
Scott, come here.

38:47.825 --> 38:48.932
This quote, here.

38:49.382 --> 38:52.342
"Carcetti may be holng the knife,
but Daniels sharpened it for him.

38:52.502 --> 38:55.432
He's been critical
of Burrell since the election."

38:56.152 --> 38:57.324
Good shit, huh?

38:57.484 --> 39:00.114
Yeah, from a high-ranking
city hall source?

39:00.520 --> 39:02.611
You feel comfortable telling me
where you got that?

39:02.771 --> 39:04.281
Not really, it being a source.

39:05.672 --> 39:07.646
It's a great quote, but, uh,

39:08.310 --> 39:10.910
if you're gonna-- if you're gonna
slam somebody anonymously,

39:11.070 --> 39:12.956
I at least have to be sure
that the quote--

39:13.115 --> 39:14.457
Nerese Campbell.

39:14.973 --> 39:17.127
She's not gonna slam
the Mayor's choice publicly,

39:17.287 --> 39:19.546
but not-for-attribution,
that's her quote.

39:20.434 --> 39:22.275
You got Nerese to say that, huh?

39:22.736 --> 39:25.093
Twigg's not the only guy
with game around here.

39:42.660 --> 39:45.600
Let Vondas know I ain't mean
no misunderstanding earlier.

40:02.084 --> 40:03.790
How do you know they're connected?

40:03.949 --> 40:06.788
Is there D.N.A. Evidence
or a signature?

40:06.948 --> 40:09.514
We can't release that yet.
You know, copycats.

40:09.674 --> 40:11.259
So there is a signature.

40:12.810 --> 40:13.863
What?

40:14.653 --> 40:15.728
You're good.

40:17.394 --> 40:19.315
- You're new, right?
- 5 months.

40:19.585 --> 40:22.458
I worked at the Sun-sentinel
in Lauderdale before this.

40:23.160 --> 40:24.904
I've read your stories.
They're good.

40:25.264 --> 40:27.065
Bullshit, but thanks.

40:28.966 --> 40:31.086
You're gonna run
something right away, right?

40:31.246 --> 40:33.374
We got to get the word out on this.

40:35.676 --> 40:37.249
What kind of name is Alma?

40:37.409 --> 40:39.120
I have a boyfriend, detective.

40:40.787 --> 40:42.173
He bigger than me?

40:42.721 --> 40:45.352
Can I ask you why
on the day in question

40:45.512 --> 40:48.178
you were operating the senator's car
when you were detained by city police

40:48.338 --> 40:50.282
with $20,000 in cash?

40:50.883 --> 40:53.727
On advice of my attorney,
I ain't gonna answer that.

40:54.275 --> 40:55.985
Ya'll trying to criminate me here.

40:56.665 --> 41:00.600
Mr. Price, you are employed
as a driver for senator Davis,

41:00.760 --> 41:03.736
earning 30,000 a year,
is that correct?

41:04.007 --> 41:05.520
- Yeah, so?
- Yet,

41:05.898 --> 41:07.899
it is my understanding that

41:08.191 --> 41:11.453
you are also drawing a $40,000 salary

41:11.612 --> 41:15.453
as the executive director
of the west Baltimore hoops charity

41:15.703 --> 41:17.189
and another 30,000

41:17.349 --> 41:21.059
as the fundraising director
for the senator's day-care initiative.

41:21.883 --> 41:25.045
How are you able to earn 3 salaries,

41:25.205 --> 41:28.453
working 3 jobs
at the same time, Mr. Price?

41:36.845 --> 41:38.315
You have a nice day.

41:40.707 --> 41:42.027
Blind motherfucker.

41:42.818 --> 41:45.944
His joint on Collington
on the east side of the street.

41:46.104 --> 41:48.789
If he give up Omar, though,
I want in on that shit.

41:49.294 --> 41:51.242
Nigga put a gun in my face, man.

41:51.693 --> 41:54.342
- Joe know about Butchie?
- Motherfucker, I know about him.

41:54.502 --> 41:56.180
Joe don't know shit about this here,

41:56.479 --> 41:58.124
and he ain't need to know.

41:58.511 --> 42:00.221
Now where my cheese at, man?

42:25.942 --> 42:27.294
The fuck you been at, nigga?

42:27.454 --> 42:30.115
Wasn't no school today, so we took Bug
to do something. Ain't no thing.

42:30.403 --> 42:32.028
It is when you don't tell no one.

42:32.354 --> 42:35.286
Now I had to come down here all day long
to make sure your shit is straight.

42:35.446 --> 42:36.874
This your corner or what, nigga?

42:37.034 --> 42:39.903
I'm checking now to make sure
shit's right at the end of the day,

42:40.276 --> 42:41.175
a-ight?

42:42.776 --> 42:44.855
- Yo, count right?
- Yeah. All straight.

42:45.197 --> 42:46.843
Ain't the point, and you know it.

42:47.199 --> 42:48.759
Chris already heard about this shit.

42:52.195 --> 42:53.638
Nice dolphin, nigga.

42:54.836 --> 42:57.827
Let's go home, man.
I'll deal with this bullshit later.

43:05.214 --> 43:08.571
That's 400 in your own
account down in the islands.

43:09.448 --> 43:11.761
There no hurricane,
department of justice,

43:11.921 --> 43:14.194
or nigga with a gun can tap that.

43:15.353 --> 43:16.703
How I even know it's there?

43:16.863 --> 43:18.787
You check it online
any time you like.

43:18.947 --> 43:20.282
On a computer?

43:21.247 --> 43:23.335
- If I can't hold it in my hand--
- A- ight.

43:23.672 --> 43:25.338
You got any prior convictions?

43:25.640 --> 43:27.048
No, nothing that rate.

43:27.394 --> 43:29.658
We get you a passport then.

43:31.654 --> 43:32.928
Take a trip.

43:46.552 --> 43:49.251
Ain't easy civilizing
this motherfucker.

43:51.247 --> 43:52.872
We chose poorly, gus.

43:55.494 --> 43:59.152
At this rate, there won't be much
to call a newspaper in 10 years.

44:00.701 --> 44:03.376
You know, my father
worked over at armco, right?

44:04.407 --> 44:06.957
And every morning
before he went to work,

44:07.117 --> 44:08.709
he'd sit at the table,

44:08.903 --> 44:11.646
reading the newspaper
with a cup of coffee,

44:12.897 --> 44:14.712
and no one could interupt him

44:15.107 --> 44:17.734
for that 15 minutes
before he walked out the door,

44:19.598 --> 44:21.566
and I remember watching him, thinking,

44:21.805 --> 44:25.578
"What the hell is so important
about that damned paper?

44:27.353 --> 44:29.130
I want to be part of that."

44:30.728 --> 44:32.857
Made me want to be a newspaperman.

44:37.204 --> 44:40.030
One day I was cutting class
at Patterson,

44:40.673 --> 44:42.729
and there was this man
on the downtown bus

44:42.889 --> 44:45.108
folding his broadsheet just so.

44:48.231 --> 44:50.403
And the way that man folded that paper

44:50.854 --> 44:53.639
and concentrated on reading those pages

44:54.275 --> 44:57.296
made him look like the smartest
son of a bitch on the bus.

44:57.950 --> 45:00.078
It was just one of those moments.

45:06.779 --> 45:08.829
"If, ever I depart this vale,

45:09.586 --> 45:11.225
"and you ever remember me

45:11.385 --> 45:13.595
"and have thought to please my ghost,

45:15.152 --> 45:16.622
"forgive some sinner,

45:17.648 --> 45:20.197
"and wink your eye
at some homely girl."

45:21.101 --> 45:22.482
Fuck Henry Mencken.

45:27.732 --> 45:29.136
I forgive you, gus.

46:13.477 --> 46:14.991
Oh, my God.

46:17.121 --> 46:20.331
You see that quote from somebody
about me stabbing Burrell in the back?

46:21.291 --> 46:22.564
That's a damn lie.

46:22.848 --> 46:24.076
So what?

46:25.152 --> 46:27.606
You're going to be
named commissioner.

46:28.849 --> 46:31.992
This is good news.
How is this not good news?

46:41.485 --> 46:42.474
Thanks.

46:43.834 --> 46:45.633
Cheap motherfucker.

47:14.856 --> 47:16.217
No, no, see.

47:16.721 --> 47:19.951
If you stack it with the domestic beer,
then I won't know.

47:21.148 --> 47:23.371
Cut a blind man some slack, hear?

47:27.553 --> 47:29.947
- Y'all servin'?
- If you got some I.D. on you.

47:33.841 --> 47:34.799
Who was that?

47:35.520 --> 47:36.592
Little girl.

47:47.052 --> 47:49.814
- Cash is in the register.
- Fuck the register, old man.

47:54.121 --> 47:57.830
They all up in your shit.
They going after every damn thing.

47:58.442 --> 47:59.532
Do you hear me?

47:59.809 --> 48:01.147
We going to jail.

48:06.022 --> 48:09.116
Focus, motherfucker, focus!

48:10.323 --> 48:11.294
Look here.

48:12.094 --> 48:15.618
Back in the girdle ads
underneath the story about the-

48:16.474 --> 48:19.550
the school board approving
a name change for p.s. 114,

48:20.362 --> 48:23.436
it's--
it's Jimmy Mcnulty's ripper.

48:24.885 --> 48:26.493
You know why they call them homeless?

48:26.860 --> 48:29.813
Because they ain't got a pot to piss in,
and you know why they ain't got a pot?

48:30.370 --> 48:31.982
Because nobody gives a good fuck.

48:33.413 --> 48:36.660
Shake it for another day or two,
and then you're back in the rotation.

48:41.303 --> 48:42.817
You done with this stupid shit?

48:43.943 --> 48:46.488
Who the fuck do you need
to hear it from, Jimmy?

48:49.556 --> 48:52.086
You have to let Burrell know
that this isn't coming from you.

48:52.246 --> 48:53.377
That won't matter.

48:53.659 --> 48:55.433
After what he read today,
I'm the threat.

48:55.593 --> 48:56.866
Then you have to tell him

48:57.026 --> 48:59.259
that you won't take the job,
that you don't want his chair.

48:59.419 --> 49:00.761
And he believes me?

49:01.226 --> 49:03.964
The alternative is that he goes public
with what he knows,

49:04.124 --> 49:06.600
whatever he has about the old days.

49:07.017 --> 49:09.728
- He sat on it this long.
- You said yourself,

49:10.154 --> 49:13.892
he'd rather bury that file than to
embarrass the department on his watch,

49:14.052 --> 49:16.235
but if it's between you
and him surviving,

49:16.687 --> 49:18.749
what do you think he'll do then?

49:24.959 --> 49:28.660
How much could even be in that file?
An assets investigation?

49:28.907 --> 49:30.199
Some loose talk?

49:30.871 --> 49:33.401
It was so long ago.
Most of those guys have moved on.

49:33.746 --> 49:35.062
He only needs smoke.

49:35.847 --> 49:38.034
He doesn't even need fire
to drag you down,

49:38.194 --> 49:39.608
to drag me down.

49:39.961 --> 49:42.862
Everything that we have
worked so hard for.

49:44.551 --> 49:46.350
We've already lost enough.

49:54.157 --> 49:55.775
What other people Omar got?

49:58.295 --> 50:00.247
Cosucker the one got the trouble.

50:01.911 --> 50:03.615
No need for you to stand tall on it.

50:09.219 --> 50:10.832
It don't have to be messy.

50:10.993 --> 50:13.600
Ain't no other way.
I can see that.

50:26.986 --> 50:28.280
Where I find Omar?

50:38.024 --> 50:39.329
Where Omar at?

50:47.579 --> 50:49.070
You a tough old man.

51:15.386 --> 51:16.886
When word get to Omar,

51:17.558 --> 51:19.402
make sure he hear everything.

51:27.454 --> 51:29.442
We still ain't got no line on the man,

51:29.602 --> 51:31.270
and now he comin' at us.

51:31.430 --> 51:32.793
We gonna change up.

51:33.231 --> 51:36.069
Marlo got to move indoors.
The rest of us need to live on the run.

51:36.229 --> 51:37.969
Fucked-up plan, you ask me.

51:38.129 --> 51:39.602
Marlo wants Omar.

51:39.836 --> 51:41.548
What else you need to know?

51:45.329 --> 51:47.722
You making your move on Burrell,
and I don't blame you,

51:47.882 --> 51:50.136
and the thing is,
I can help with that.

51:50.418 --> 51:53.489
The ministers, Nerese,
black legislative caucus--

51:53.874 --> 51:57.064
- I can bring them around for you.
- Feel free.

51:57.494 --> 52:00.567
All I need is some help
with this grand jury nonsense.

52:01.129 --> 52:02.111
You go to Bond,

52:02.581 --> 52:04.661
- you tell Bond that--
- I can't help you with that.

52:04.821 --> 52:07.588
Story's been out all day,
and our phone isn't ringing.

52:08.054 --> 52:09.546
The ministers, Nerese, the caucus,

52:09.706 --> 52:11.621
they're willing
to live with Daniels apparently.

52:12.063 --> 52:13.338
Thanks anyway.

52:20.195 --> 52:22.132
Thinking you can cut Clay loose, huh?

52:23.346 --> 52:24.706
Thinking I'm done.

52:51.444 --> 52:52.409
Bonjour.

52:53.221 --> 52:54.537
Came to see my account.

52:55.242 --> 52:56.885
Vous parlez pas francais?

52:57.643 --> 52:58.937
Y'all got my money?

52:59.233 --> 53:00.838
Je ne parle pas anglais.

53:06.853 --> 53:07.761
This mine.

53:07.921 --> 53:09.637
- Y'all got my money.
- Oui, monsieur.

53:10.128 --> 53:11.818
J'ai juste besoin de ça.

53:13.469 --> 53:15.961
S'il vous plaît,
est-ce que je pourrais avoir le...

53:17.146 --> 53:18.177
ça.

53:19.075 --> 53:20.165
Merci.

53:22.130 --> 53:23.693
Identification,
s'il vous plait.

53:23.853 --> 53:24.778
What?

53:26.340 --> 53:27.546
- Ça.
- Yeah.

53:29.298 --> 53:30.219
Oui.

53:31.842 --> 53:32.852
Merci.

53:37.531 --> 53:38.997
OK, monsieur Marlo.

53:42.629 --> 53:45.152
So you string together
Barlow's murder

53:45.698 --> 53:49.303
and Cole's unconnected case and yours,
which is natural to begin with...

53:49.463 --> 53:52.685
Instant serial killer,
which I thought would get the brass

53:52.845 --> 53:54.849
to begin kicking out some money
to work real cases.

53:55.009 --> 53:56.063
Like Marlo.

53:56.326 --> 53:57.468
Like Marlo.

54:01.410 --> 54:03.706
Shit like this actually goes
through your fucking brain?

54:05.230 --> 54:07.472
If you don't want listen to me,
then listen to Lester.

54:07.632 --> 54:09.051
He has all the wisdom you need.

54:09.211 --> 54:12.131
Joke of it is, no one gives
a fuck about a serial killer,

54:12.291 --> 54:15.121
not unless he's carving up
some pretty coed or some shit.

54:15.564 --> 54:17.871
Sunpapers put the story
in their back pages.

54:18.031 --> 54:19.404
Eh, you fucked up.

54:19.620 --> 54:20.981
Yeah. Tell him.

54:21.528 --> 54:25.405
No. I mean, if you want to do it right,
a straight-up strangle's not enough.

54:26.398 --> 54:27.634
Not if it's some vagrant.

54:32.143 --> 54:33.722
Sensationalize it.

54:34.317 --> 54:36.951
Give the killer some fucked-up fantasy,

54:37.111 --> 54:39.298
something bad, real bad.

54:39.781 --> 54:41.865
It's got to grip the hearts and minds,

54:42.025 --> 54:44.372
give the people what they want
from a serial killer.

54:44.532 --> 54:47.031
- Lester, what the fuck?
- No. You're onto something.

54:47.974 --> 54:50.400
I only need a few weeks
to pull down Marlo Stanfeld.

54:50.560 --> 54:52.666
You fly this mess right,
you can give it to me.

54:53.443 --> 54:56.065
Who gives a damn
if we fake a couple murders

54:56.225 --> 54:57.851
that we're never gonna solve, huh?

54:58.559 --> 55:00.106
The dead men don't care.

55:00.535 --> 55:01.861
No one cares,

55:02.363 --> 55:03.811
but if it's gonna get the bosses

55:03.971 --> 55:05.798
to throw down
enough coin to do police work--

55:05.958 --> 55:08.141
I'm out.
I'm out of here.

55:15.083 --> 55:16.973
We got to give your killer a name.

55:17.499 --> 55:19.100
We have to kill again.

55:36.392 --> 55:38.370
Poppy, we've got to cook
one of these one night.

55:38.530 --> 55:40.743
- Yeah, right on.
- Nice little dinner.

55:41.951 --> 55:43.658
Omar, Omar, Omar!

55:46.184 --> 55:48.224
Hold on, hold on, hold on!

55:49.756 --> 55:51.553
All right, all right. Here you go.

55:52.315 --> 55:54.805
- Mañana, poppy. Tomorrow, OK?
- Tomorrow.

55:55.156 --> 55:56.713
Mana, poppy. No.

55:56.873 --> 55:58.166
Mana, Alexis.

56:36.559 --> 56:40.343
Hey, 'Naldo, cous got to find out
where they got honeynut, yo,

56:41.067 --> 56:43.918
if they expect us
to call this spit o' land home.

56:58.459 --> 56:59.863
Recibía una llamada.

57:01.142 --> 57:02.655
Tengo mala noticia.

57:05.951 --> 57:06.954
Qué pasó?

57:08.890 --> 57:10.389
Mataron a Butchie.

57:11.305 --> 57:17.652
