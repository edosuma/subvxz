It seems the Ninth Circle was
a step ahead of us as well.

09:54.251 --> 09:56.168
You must be General Stewart,

09:56.171 --> 10:00.121
A.K.A. the stepfather that John
hasn't told his closest friends about.

10:00.124 --> 10:02.846
STEWART: So this is
where you people work.

10:02.849 --> 10:04.244
Impressive.

10:07.357 --> 10:10.099
How did your men end up
at Smoak Tech, General?

10:10.101 --> 10:11.951
Several months ago, the D.I.A. got wind

10:11.953 --> 10:13.944
of Ninth Circle mole inside A.R.G.U.S.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.381
Since then, we've made it a point

10:15.384 --> 10:17.283
of tracking their activity, including

10:17.286 --> 10:19.296
the theft of that drive, which led us

10:19.299 --> 10:20.322
to your friend Virgil.

10:20.325 --> 10:23.962
Wait. Wait. Wait. I thought you
said you didn't know anything.

10:23.965 --> 10:26.281
I said I couldn't tell you anything.

10:26.283 --> 10:30.661
A lie of omission is
still a lie, General.

10:30.663 --> 10:33.664
I'm sorry, John, but it was classified.

10:33.666 --> 10:35.975
What was on the drive?

10:35.977 --> 10:38.335
A list of assets we have in the field...

10:38.337 --> 10:41.226
Special operatives with
high-level security clearance.

10:41.229 --> 10:42.798
FELICITY: That's why Emiko took Archer,

10:42.801 --> 10:43.941
so that she could hunt them down

10:43.943 --> 10:45.467
and then gain access to what they know,

10:45.469 --> 10:46.894
which she could pretty much do

10:46.896 --> 10:49.375
with anybody now that she has their DNA.

10:49.378 --> 10:51.974
It's only a matter of time before
they find everyone on that list.

10:51.976 --> 10:53.901
We need to make sure
those assets are secure.

10:53.903 --> 10:55.328

10:55.330 --> 10:57.238
I'll call my assets to a safe house.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.940
This is General Stewart. We
need to start evacuations.

10:59.942 --> 11:01.584

11:04.945 --> 11:07.779

11:07.782 --> 11:09.616

11:13.625 --> 11:14.681
That's not like you, John.

11:14.683 --> 11:16.624

"yes, sir" to that man?

11:16.627 --> 11:21.187

like to know why you won't.

11:21.189 --> 11:22.271

11:23.857 --> 11:26.525
I would like to know why you never...

11:26.528 --> 11:29.219
Never mentioned that
you had a stepfather.

11:29.221 --> 11:30.888

11:30.890 --> 11:33.571
That man has not been in my life

11:33.574 --> 11:35.776

joined the military.

11:35.785 --> 11:37.285
Ok. I just met him.

11:37.288 --> 11:38.891
All I have is my first impression,

11:38.894 --> 11:40.352
and my first impression is that

11:40.355 --> 11:42.205
he doesn't seem like that bad of a guy.

11:42.208 --> 11:44.952
Oliver, when I first met the general,

11:44.954 --> 11:47.547
he was a lieutenant,

11:47.549 --> 11:51.718
my father's CO on a covert military op

11:51.720 --> 11:53.720
to quell an insurgency in Vlatava.

11:53.722 --> 11:56.160
The op went bad.

11:56.163 --> 11:57.965
The unit was pinned down

11:57.967 --> 12:00.059
with heavy gunfire from insurgents.

12:00.061 --> 12:04.421
My dad stayed behind to hold them off.

12:04.423 --> 12:07.549
Saved the whole unit.
Stewart made it out.

12:07.551 --> 12:09.279
My father didn't.

12:09.282 --> 12:12.556
So do you blame him
for your father's death?

12:12.559 --> 12:16.957
It was his op. He
should've stayed behind.

12:16.960 --> 12:19.019
Six months later,

12:19.021 --> 12:21.230
he's coming by the house for dinner.

12:21.232 --> 12:22.606
Six months, Oliver.

12:22.608 --> 12:23.680
I didn't know.

12:23.683 --> 12:25.269
It was bad enough that, uh,

12:25.272 --> 12:27.680
he just appeared in our lives, but...

12:27.683 --> 12:29.738
Once he and my mom got married,

12:29.740 --> 12:31.758
he had me and Andy running

12:31.760 --> 12:35.077

learned as a recon marine.

12:35.079 --> 12:37.162
I mean, how long could
we be out in the cold

12:37.164 --> 12:39.456
trying to find our way out of
the woods without a compass.

12:39.458 --> 12:40.850
He called it "tough love."

how we felt about him

12:45.256 --> 12:46.910

12:46.913 --> 12:49.058
I don't know. If he was so strong,

12:49.060 --> 12:52.136
how could he just abandon
the first rule of the corps

12:52.138 --> 12:54.947
