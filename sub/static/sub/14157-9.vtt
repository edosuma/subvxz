06:47.307 --> 06:48.776
I BET ANNA WINTOUR NEVER HAD TO

06:48.776 --> 06:49.743
PUT UP WITH THIS LEVEL OF

06:49.743 --> 06:50.778
INCOMPETENCE.

06:50.778 --> 06:52.079
>> WHO'S ANNA?

06:52.079 --> 06:53.313

07:00.954 --> 07:02.055
>> I DON'T READ WOMEN'S

07:02.055 --> 07:03.056
MAGAZINES.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.792
>> WELL, IT'S PART OF MY JOB,

07:04.792 --> 07:05.626
JUST LIKE READING THOSE

07:05.626 --> 07:06.527
MUSCLE-HEAD MAGAZINES IS PART OF

07:06.527 --> 07:07.360
YOURS.

07:07.360 --> 07:08.395
>> I DON'T KNOW THE NAMES OF ANY

07:08.395 --> 07:10.998
OF THE EDITORS.

07:10.998 --> 07:12.332

07:12.332 --> 07:14.334
>> MM-HMM.

07:25.078 --> 07:26.714
>> SO HOW'S THAT COMPANY COMING

07:26.714 --> 07:28.148
WITH YOU AND TERRENCE?

07:28.148 --> 07:29.249
>> GOOD.

07:29.249 --> 07:30.317
YOU KNOW, I THINK WE REALLY HAVE

07:30.317 --> 07:31.151
SOMETHING.

07:31.151 --> 07:32.085
>> YEAH, I'M REALLY HAPPY FOR

07:32.085 --> 07:33.053
HIM.

07:33.053 --> 07:35.523
IT'S GOOD TO SEE HIM DO SO WELL.

07:35.523 --> 07:37.224
ESPECIALLY WITH SOMEBODY SO

07:37.224 --> 07:38.091
LOVELY.

07:38.091 --> 07:38.992
>> TERRENCE AND I ARE STRICTLY

07:38.992 --> 07:39.860
BUSINESS PARTNERS.

07:39.860 --> 07:40.828
>> I'VE KNOWN TERRENCE A LONG

07:40.828 --> 07:42.530
TIME, I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM LIKE

07:42.530 --> 07:43.731
THIS.

07:43.731 --> 07:44.832
>> LIKE THIS WHAT?

07:44.832 --> 07:46.433
>> SO PROTECTIVE OF A WOMAN.

07:46.433 --> 07:47.334
EVER.

07:47.334 --> 07:48.335
>> PROTECTIVE.

07:48.335 --> 07:49.402
>> YEAH.

07:49.402 --> 07:51.171
I MEAN, HE PRACTICALLY WARNED ME

07:51.171 --> 07:52.239
TO STAY AWAY FROM YOU.

07:52.239 --> 07:53.206
>> [laughs] WHY WOULD HE DO

07:53.206 --> 07:54.407
THAT?

07:54.407 --> 07:55.843
>> GOT NO IDEA.

07:55.843 --> 07:57.444
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN GOOD TO HIM.

07:57.444 --> 08:00.781
IN FACT, WE ACTUALLY HAD

08:00.781 --> 08:02.015
BUSINESS TOGETHER BACK IN THE

08:02.015 --> 08:02.850
DAY.

08:02.850 --> 08:03.684
>> OH, OKAY.

08:03.684 --> 08:05.553
WHAT TYPE OF BUSINESS WAS THAT?

08:05.553 --> 08:07.320
>> ILLEGAL.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.956
>> OH.

08:08.956 --> 08:10.157
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.458
>> MOST PEOPLE DON'T.

08:11.458 --> 08:13.627
SEE, I'VE GOT MANY DIFFERENT

08:13.627 --> 08:17.297
BUSINESSES.

08:18.666 --> 08:20.868
BUT TERRENCE WAS REALLY

08:20.868 --> 08:22.636
IMPORTANT TO THE ILLEGAL

08:22.636 --> 08:23.571
BUSINESS.

08:23.571 --> 08:24.572
BUT NOW HE WANTS NOTHING TO DO

08:24.572 --> 08:26.006
WITH ME, SO I FIGURED I'D COME

08:26.006 --> 08:29.109
TO YOU AND SEE IF YOU CAN HELP.

08:29.109 --> 08:30.277
>> YEAH, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY

08:30.277 --> 08:32.045
TAKE THAT UP WITH HIM YOURSELF,

08:32.045 --> 08:34.281
BECAUSE I DON'T--I SHOULDN'T

08:34.281 --> 08:36.349
REALLY HAVE ANY PART OF THAT.

08:36.349 --> 08:39.019
>> WELL, TOO LATE.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.954
YOU ALREADY DO.

08:40.954 --> 08:42.990
>> OKAY, WELL, LET ME REPHRASE

08:42.990 --> 08:45.158
THAT.

08:45.158 --> 08:48.696
I DON'T WANT TO BE PART OF IT.

08:50.664 --> 08:53.066
>> [sighs]

08:53.066 --> 08:54.201
YOU WENT TO BUSINESS SCHOOL,

08:54.201 --> 08:55.603
RIGHT?

08:55.603 --> 08:57.871
DEFINE "HOSTILE TAKEOVER."

09:06.379 --> 09:10.383
OR YOU GO DIRECTLY TO THE

09:10.383 --> 09:12.986
SHAREHOLDERS.

09:12.986 --> 09:14.487
AND I'M GOING TO FRANKS JEWELS.

09:14.487 --> 09:15.956

09:18.125 --> 09:19.092
>> BUT YOU ARE SOMEBODY THAT

09:19.092 --> 09:21.494
TERRENCE HOLDS DEAR.

09:21.494 --> 09:22.963
>> LIKE I SAID, DEACON, I THINK

09:22.963 --> 09:25.332
YOU'VE MISTAKEN THE ENTIRE

09:25.332 --> 09:26.934
SITUATION--Y--

09:26.934 --> 09:28.001
I THINK THAT I NEED TO JUST CALL

YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.

09:36.109 --> 09:37.978
>> OH, YES, I DO.

09:37.978 --> 09:39.112
APPARENTLY SO DO THE FRANKS

09:39.112 --> 09:40.648

09:40.648 --> 09:41.649
OTHERWISE THEY WOULD'VE CUT ME

INTO THE DEAL WHEN I GAVE THEM

09:43.150 --> 09:44.752
THE CHANCE.

09:44.752 --> 09:45.819

09:45.819 --> 09:47.254
DEAL THAT YOU HAVE WITH TERRENCE

09:47.254 --> 09:48.088

09:49.857 --> 09:52.492
OBVIOUSLY, THEY WANT TO BARGAIN.

09:52.492 --> 09:54.494
AND YOU, MY DEAR, ARE THE

09:54.494 --> 09:56.764
PERFECT BARGAINING CHIP.

10:01.401 --> 10:03.637
>> SO HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW THE

10:03.637 --> 10:05.372
FRANKS BROTHERS ANYWAY?

10:05.372 --> 10:07.074
>> ENOUGH.

I HAVE BEEN MARRIED BEFORE.

31:47.439 --> 31:49.675
I HAVE--I'VE BEEN HERE.

31:49.675 --> 31:52.078
>> I LOVE MY HUSBAND. I DO.

31:52.078 --> 31:53.612
PLEASE DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

31:53.612 --> 31:54.546
>> NO, I WON'T.

31:54.546 --> 31:55.881
IT'S NOT MY PLACE.

31:55.881 --> 31:56.983
BUT YOU SHOULD REALLY CONSIDER

31:56.983 --> 31:59.351
GETTING A MARRIAGE COUNSELOR.

31:59.351 --> 32:02.588
JUST SAYING.

32:04.790 --> 32:06.125
HEY.

32:06.125 --> 32:07.259
I COULD REALLY USE A REFILL.

32:07.259 --> 32:08.995
YOU GUYS WANT ANYTHING?

32:08.995 --> 32:10.862
>> YEAH.

32:10.862 --> 32:12.131
>> OKAY.

32:12.131 --> 32:15.767
>> MAKE IT A DOUBLE.

32:15.767 --> 32:18.837
>> SOUNDS GREAT.

32:26.178 --> 32:29.015
>> IT'S OKAY, YOU'RE SAFE NOW.

32:29.015 --> 32:31.650

32:32.784 --> 32:33.852
THAT I CAN TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE

32:33.852 --> 32:37.823
PROTECTED.

32:37.823 --> 32:39.391
>> DEACON HAD A LOT TO SAY ABOUT

32:39.391 --> 32:41.827
YOU AND YOUR PAST.

32:41.827 --> 32:44.830
>> IT IS PAST. I TOLD YOU.

32:44.830 --> 32:45.797
ALL RIGHT, I'M NOT ABOUT THAT

32:45.797 --> 32:46.698
LIFE ANYMORE.

32:46.698 --> 32:47.699
I DIDN'T GO LOOKING FOR HIM, HE

32:47.699 --> 32:48.867
CAME LOOKING FOR ME.

32:48.867 --> 32:50.202
>> I BELIEVE YOU.

32:50.202 --> 32:51.837
TERRENCE, HOW ARE YOU GONNA GET

32:51.837 --> 32:54.173

32:54.173 --> 32:55.241
>> I DON'T KNOW, I'M WORKING ON

32:55.241 --> 32:56.642

33:05.051 --> 33:07.786
>> COUPLE OF DAYS.

33:07.786 --> 33:09.255
HEY, LOOK, IT'S GETTING LATE.

33:09.255 --> 33:10.222
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY TRY TO GET

33:10.222 --> 33:12.791
SOME SLEEP.

33:12.791 --> 33:13.892
>> YEAH, I DON'T THINK THAT'S

33:13.892 --> 33:15.661
GONNA HAPPEN.

33:15.661 --> 33:17.296
BUT, UM...

33:17.296 --> 33:18.297
I THINK I'M GONNA GO TAKE A HOT

33:18.297 --> 33:19.165
BATH.

33:19.165 --> 33:21.633
>> I'LL BE RIGHT HERE.

33:47.093 --> 33:48.227

33:48.227 --> 33:49.228
>> I'D NEVER FORGIVE YOU IF HE

33:49.228 --> 33:50.562
DID.

33:50.562 --> 33:51.563
>> DOES THAT MEAN YOU'LL BE ABLE

33:51.563 --> 33:52.964
TO FORGIVE ME NOW?

33:52.964 --> 33:55.367
>> THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID.

33:55.367 --> 33:56.868
>> LISTEN, BABY, I REALLY--

33:56.868 --> 33:57.703
I REALLY DO WANT TO EXPLAIN

33:57.703 --> 33:58.537
EVERYTHING, IT'S JUST--

33:58.537 --> 33:59.505
>> NOW YOU DO.

33:59.505 --> 34:00.672
ONLY BECAUSE IT ALL BLEW UP IN

34:00.672 --> 34:01.540
YOUR FACE.

34:01.540 --> 34:02.708
>> OH, FOR GOD'S SAKES, KEISHA,

34:02.708 --> 34:03.542
ARE YOU EVER GONNA LET ME

34:03.542 --> 34:05.411
EXPLAIN, OR WOULD YOU RATHER

34:05.411 --> 34:06.745
JUST BE MAD AT ME?

34:06.745 --> 34:09.748
>> I HAVEN'T DECIDED YET.

34:09.748 --> 34:10.616
>> HEY.

34:10.616 --> 34:11.450
>> HEY. [scoffs]

34:11.450 --> 34:12.384

34:14.720 --> 34:15.654
DEACON COULD'VE TAKEN YOU,

34:15.654 --> 34:16.555
KEISHA, OKAY?

34:16.555 --> 34:17.556
HE COULD'VE TAKEN YOU, AND THAT

34:17.556 --> 34:18.924
ALONE WOULD'VE DESTROYED ME.

34:18.924 --> 34:19.891
>> THEN I GUESS YOU SHOULD'VE

34:19.891 --> 34:20.759
THOUGHT HARDER BEFORE YOU GOT

34:20.759 --> 34:23.429
YOURSELF INTO ALL THIS.

34:23.429 --> 34:24.596
I'M EXHAUSTED, I CAN'T DO THIS

34:24.596 --> 34:26.298
WITH YOU RIGHT NOW.

34:26.298 --> 34:28.734
>> YEAH.

34:30.802 --> 34:33.272
>> UH, WHAT YOU DOING?

34:33.272 --> 34:35.174

34:35.174 --> 34:36.475
>> NOT WITH ME YOU'RE NOT.

34:36.475 --> 34:37.409
>> SO WHERE AM I SUPPOSED TO

34:37.409 --> 34:38.344
SLEEP?

34:38.344 --> 34:39.845
>> ON THE COUCH, ON THE FLOOR,

34:39.845 --> 34:43.982
AT A HOTEL, IT'S UP TO YOU.
