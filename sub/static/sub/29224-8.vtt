00:33.199 --> 00:34.199
Are you...

00:36.327 --> 00:37.328
afraid of me?

00:41.875 --> 00:43.376
- Seriously?
- Clay...

00:43.460 --> 00:44.820
What do you think I might do, huh?

00:44.878 --> 00:47.464
- And you were searching my room, for what?
- I don't know.

00:47.547 --> 00:49.227
Why were you asking around about me today?

00:49.299 --> 00:51.009
Why didn't you tell me about that night?

00:51.426 --> 00:52.426
With Bryce...

00:52.761 --> 00:53.762
and the gun?

00:54.429 --> 00:56.389
It was a stupid mistake,
and nothing happened.

00:56.473 --> 00:58.850
What about Hannah?
You never told me about her.

00:58.933 --> 01:01.394
Why would I? There's plenty of shit
you didn't tell me!

01:01.478 --> 01:02.854
You really hated Bryce!

01:02.937 --> 01:05.522
Yeah, I did.
I told you that. Multiple times!

01:05.607 --> 01:07.358
You hated him enough
to point a gun at him.

01:07.442 --> 01:10.111
- Uh-huh. Keep going.
- Why does nobody know where you were

01:10.195 --> 01:11.195
on Homecoming night?

01:11.237 --> 01:12.781
Jesus, how many people did you ask?

01:12.864 --> 01:14.824
Justin said that you got in at 1:30,

01:14.908 --> 01:16.668
Tyler said that you dropped him off
at 11:00.

01:16.743 --> 01:19.829
- That's two and a half hours!
- You did a fucking timeline?

01:19.913 --> 01:22.207
- Where were you?
- I was driving around!

01:22.290 --> 01:23.666
Okay? Trying to clear my head!

01:23.750 --> 01:25.293
Until 1:30 in the morning?

01:25.376 --> 01:26.795
Yeah, my fucking heart was broken!

01:26.878 --> 01:27.878
Just don't...

01:28.838 --> 01:29.838
Don't shout at me.

01:30.965 --> 01:32.133
You think I killed him?

01:34.177 --> 01:35.178
I don't want to.

01:37.013 --> 01:39.099
You think I could do something like that?

01:39.557 --> 01:41.935
That I could... I could kill a person?

01:42.644 --> 01:43.728
A human being?

01:47.107 --> 01:48.107
I don't know.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.071
Get the fuck out of here.

01:55.406 --> 01:56.407
Go.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.117
Go!

02:08.586 --> 02:09.586
<i>Yes.</i>

02:11.297 --> 02:12.423
I was terrified.

02:15.051 --> 02:16.386
I thought I knew him best.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.680
But when I walked out that door...

02:20.390 --> 02:21.641
I wasn't sure I ever did.

02:27.105 --> 02:28.982
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

02:33.778 --> 02:35.738
<i>I had never met Kevin Porter.</i>

02:41.619 --> 02:45.415
Thank you for coming to meet me.
I thought it was safer than the house.

02:46.040 --> 02:47.208
"Safer"?

02:47.625 --> 02:50.712
I have an appointment
with Sheriff DÃ­az this morning.

02:51.921 --> 02:54.424
- I see.
- They want me to come in on background.

02:54.507 --> 02:56.926
And I wanted you to know,
so you didn't think...

02:57.719 --> 02:59.053
so you knew that...

03:00.221 --> 03:02.390
what went on between you, me and Bryce...

03:03.516 --> 03:05.185
I won't say a thing about that.

03:06.227 --> 03:07.270
I wish you wouldn't.

03:11.149 --> 03:13.568
- They're looking at Clay Jensen.
- They are?

03:14.068 --> 03:16.070
- Wow.
- He always hated Bryce.

03:16.946 --> 03:18.990
Threatened him
on more than one occasion.

03:19.574 --> 03:21.075
There's quite a case to be made.

03:23.953 --> 03:25.663
Perhaps you can help them make it?

03:26.748 --> 03:28.917
<i>But Kevin Porter knew Clay well.</i>

03:29.709 --> 03:32.253
So, you didn't see Bryce after that?

03:32.337 --> 03:34.964
- Over the summer, this fall?
- No.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.448
You had no contact with him at all?

03:39.928 --> 03:41.137
No. No contact at all.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.223
Never went over to his new house?

03:43.890 --> 03:44.890
Threatened him again?

03:45.350 --> 03:46.990
- No.
- Can you think of any other reasons

03:47.018 --> 03:48.686
why the police would suspect you?

03:49.270 --> 03:51.231
It's Mrs. Walker, she's out to get me.

03:51.648 --> 03:53.648
Look, you have to believe me.
I didn't do anything.

03:53.691 --> 03:56.069
Clay, we believe you. We just...

03:56.903 --> 03:58.783
The more we know,
the better we can protect you.

03:58.821 --> 03:59.864
There's nothing to know.

04:03.576 --> 04:05.328
Dennis has agreed to represent you.

04:05.411 --> 04:08.623
He started out in the PD's office.
He knows criminal defense.

04:08.706 --> 04:10.208
- I'm not a criminal.
- We know.

04:10.541 --> 04:12.669
Clay, we need to take action.
We need to protect you.

04:14.545 --> 04:16.214
- So, what... what can I do?
- Nothing.

04:16.880 --> 04:18.201
Dennis was very clear about that.

04:18.257 --> 04:21.458
You don't wanna give the police or Mrs.
Walker anything they can use against you.

04:22.220 --> 04:24.013
And we'd like you to see Dr. Ellman.

04:25.431 --> 04:28.268
- Why?
- Just to check in. This is a tricky time.

04:28.351 --> 04:30.895
It might be useful to... talk it through.

04:31.187 --> 04:32.981
So, you think I'm, like, crazy?

04:33.064 --> 04:34.983
- We don't.
- Mental illness might come up.

04:35.066 --> 04:37.694
We don't! We just thought
it might be worth talking to him.

04:38.611 --> 04:40.780
Right now, you boys have to get to school.

04:45.451 --> 04:48.288
<i>I wasn't sure
anyone truly knew Clay at all.</i>

04:48.955 --> 04:51.708
All I'm saying is
your folks are doing the right thing.

04:51.791 --> 04:54.961
You need a lawyer,
even if you didn't do anything. Trust me.

04:55.878 --> 04:56.878
What's it like?

04:57.880 --> 05:00.091
- In juvie?
- Dude, you're not going to juvie.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.135
No, I'm an adult.

05:03.386 --> 05:06.222
Clay, you just got to chill out.
Just a little bit.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.766
- It's going to work out.
- Like it did for you?

05:12.937 --> 05:14.605
I have to go talk to Mrs. Walker.

05:14.772 --> 05:17.483
- Why... why the fuck?
- At the sheriff's station

05:17.567 --> 05:19.777
the first time,
I could tell her the truth to her face.

05:19.861 --> 05:22.196
Your mom literally just said
do not do anything suspicious.

05:22.280 --> 05:23.740
She also thinks I'm a crazy person.

05:23.823 --> 05:25.992
I feel like you going to talk
to Mrs. Walker right now

05:26.075 --> 05:27.243
kind of supports that theory.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.680
They're getting me a lawyer
because they had to take action.

05:29.704 --> 05:30.704
That's what she said.

05:30.913 --> 05:31.913
Same for me.

05:32.957 --> 05:33.958
Clay!

05:36.753 --> 05:37.753
Fuck!

05:39.881 --> 05:43.051
<i>Though we all knew
he didn't always make the best choices.</i>

05:44.719 --> 05:45.719
Yes?

05:45.762 --> 05:46.846
What are you doing here?

05:48.765 --> 05:50.433
I'm actually...

05:50.516 --> 05:52.810
If you're looking for my daughter,
she's at school,

05:52.894 --> 05:54.014
where I think you should be.

05:54.062 --> 05:55.438
No. I mean,

05:56.397 --> 05:58.107
yes, I should, but...

06:01.235 --> 06:02.612
I came to see Mrs. Walker.

06:02.695 --> 06:03.738
She's not home.

06:04.781 --> 06:05.782
Let him in.

06:14.874 --> 06:15.874
So,

06:16.334 --> 06:18.294
stalking in our driveway wasn't enough?

06:18.378 --> 06:20.380
You want to add trespassing to the list?

06:20.463 --> 06:23.299
Mrs. Walker, I just...
I thought maybe we could talk.

06:25.718 --> 06:27.720
I'm guessing
your parents don't know you're here.

06:29.555 --> 06:32.058
- No.
- What exactly do you want to talk about,

06:32.141 --> 06:34.310
- Clay?
- When we spoke at the police station,

06:34.394 --> 06:36.354
you said Bryce had hurt me,

06:36.437 --> 06:37.688
that we didn't get along.

06:38.022 --> 06:40.233
And you were right, I hated Bryce.

06:40.316 --> 06:42.568
But I didn't want him dead.

06:42.860 --> 06:44.237
But you threatened to kill him.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.823
Look, when you told me
he might be hurt, I...

06:48.783 --> 06:50.118
Yeah, I hoped that was true.

06:50.827 --> 06:53.454
Because he'd hurt so many people
in my life,

06:53.538 --> 06:54.997
and if he was gone, I...

06:56.582 --> 06:58.334
Maybe the hurting would... would stop.

06:59.419 --> 07:00.419
And I...

07:01.170 --> 07:03.131
I'm sorry your son is dead.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.801
He was a human being
and he didn't deserve to die.

07:06.884 --> 07:09.512
But you have to believe me,
I didn't kill him.

07:09.595 --> 07:13.516
Mr. Chatham, please!
You have to eat your breakfast.

07:15.309 --> 07:16.477
Will you excuse me?

07:17.061 --> 07:18.312
One moment.

07:44.964 --> 07:47.151
Don't fuck shit up
'cause you're still in love with her!

07:47.175 --> 07:48.009
You have no idea

07:48.092 --> 07:50.571
- what you're talking about!
- She's fucking scared of you, Alex.

07:50.595 --> 07:53.222
What, so she sent you
to fight for her, man? Fuck that!

07:53.556 --> 07:55.016
All right, Roid Monster!

07:55.558 --> 07:56.798
- Take a fucking breath.
- Yeah,

07:56.851 --> 07:58.936
I'm the monster.
What are you on today, Justin?

07:59.020 --> 08:01.165
- Does she even know?
- Know what? Just move on.

08:01.189 --> 08:04.168
- Just leave her alone and move on.
- Why, so you can let her get raped again?

08:04.192 --> 08:05.860
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

08:05.943 --> 08:08.905
Hey, guys. Guys! Stop it! Stop!

08:13.409 --> 08:14.409
What the fuck?

08:15.536 --> 08:17.598
- Morning.
- Good morning, doc.

08:17.622 --> 08:18.623
Thanks for coming down.

08:19.165 --> 08:20.875
- Holy shit.
- Let's go right in.

08:22.043 --> 08:23.377
What the fuck is he doing here?

08:25.671 --> 08:27.548
<i>Mr. Porter knew Clay's secrets.</i>

08:30.176 --> 08:33.054
<i>Mr. Porter knew what Clay could do
at his very worst.</i>

08:34.764 --> 08:36.474
The superintendent indicated

08:36.599 --> 08:39.477
he'd prefer it be done
with minimum disruption to the school day.

08:39.559 --> 08:41.645
Yes, well, we're very happy
to cooperate, Sheriff.

08:41.729 --> 08:45.107
We're just less interested
in exposing ourselves to the...

08:45.191 --> 08:48.444
- liability of a former employee.
- Mr. Porter's here

08:48.528 --> 08:49.737
as a friend of the department.

08:49.820 --> 08:52.532
If you'd be more comfortable,
we could take the kids downtown

08:52.615 --> 08:53.824
one at a time.

08:53.991 --> 08:57.036
You'll be reading these kids their rights,
yes?

08:57.203 --> 08:59.163
We'll let them know
that they're not under arrest

08:59.247 --> 09:00.581
or even obligated to speak.

09:00.665 --> 09:03.876
All right. I'm going to have
Vice Principal Childs join you,

09:03.960 --> 09:05.503
'cause I'm needed off-campus.

09:11.008 --> 09:13.594
Look, I'm telling you,
it was Porter with the Sheriff.

09:13.678 --> 09:16.889
- Why the hell would he come back here?
- It's got to be about Bryce, right?

09:17.223 --> 09:18.933
What if he knows about me somehow?

09:19.892 --> 09:22.478
How could he? It has to be about Bryce.

09:23.938 --> 09:24.981
Miss Adams?

09:25.064 --> 09:27.358
Tyler Down is needed
in the Principal's office.

09:41.289 --> 09:43.958
If this is about you
and they're starting with him...

09:44.083 --> 09:45.167
We're all fucked.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.594
Thanks for sending Justin
to smack me down.

09:54.969 --> 09:58.055
Oh, my God.
I didn't send Justin to do anything.

09:58.139 --> 10:00.057
Look, I'm sorry about yesterday.

10:00.808 --> 10:01.892
Whatever.

10:03.477 --> 10:05.313
Porter's here with the Sheriff.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.022
Wait, who?

10:07.607 --> 10:08.607
Porter?

10:08.858 --> 10:11.736
Counselor Porter? What the fuck?

10:11.819 --> 10:13.863
- Why?
- It's got to be about Bryce, right?

10:13.946 --> 10:15.114
But what would he know?

10:15.197 --> 10:17.825
A lot about last year.
Didn't you talk to him about shit?

10:17.908 --> 10:18.908
Not really.

10:24.957 --> 10:27.168
Hey, Tyler. It's good to see you.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.087
Come in and have a seat.

10:38.346 --> 10:39.930
Should my parents be here?

10:40.389 --> 10:42.141
Well, that's not necessary, Tyler.

10:43.100 --> 10:44.518
It's nothing to worry about,

10:44.602 --> 10:47.229
- we just want to have a conversation.
- About what?

10:47.313 --> 10:49.273
Well, you're not obligated
to answer any questions

10:49.315 --> 10:50.650
and we're not holding you.

10:50.983 --> 10:53.986
We just want to ask you a few questions
about Clay Jensen.

11:01.786 --> 11:04.372
<i>Porter was part of the Hannah story.</i>

11:05.122 --> 11:06.624
<i>A story I had just heard...</i>

11:11.671 --> 11:15.549
<i>starring a Clay who was nothing
like the one I used to know.</i>

11:25.017 --> 11:26.017
Hello.

11:27.103 --> 11:28.229
Hey.

11:30.356 --> 11:34.944
So... because we can't kiss
that also means we can't talk?

11:35.569 --> 11:37.863
Well, we're not... not talking.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.408
We're not not not talking.

11:41.075 --> 11:42.493
So, we are talking?

11:42.993 --> 11:43.993
Apparently.

11:44.829 --> 11:48.249
- Look, I have an exam in the next hour.
- Two minutes.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.209
- Can we talk later?
- No.

11:50.292 --> 11:53.713
Because you always say that, and it's
never later. Just 60 seconds. Time me.

11:54.505 --> 11:55.715
Time me, starting...

11:55.798 --> 11:56.798
now.

11:57.007 --> 12:00.052
Okay. Look, I get it.
It was a one-time thing.

12:00.386 --> 12:03.973
You were momentarily overcome
by my natural powers of attraction,

12:04.056 --> 12:07.268
and honestly, I don't blame you,
but we can get past it.

12:07.935 --> 12:10.479
We can go back to us pre-kiss.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.940
I can go back to not wanting to kiss you.

12:13.023 --> 12:16.026
I didn't even know I wanted to kiss you
until you kissed me.

12:16.569 --> 12:17.569
Or I kissed...

12:18.195 --> 12:21.282
Or until there was a kiss between us.

12:21.866 --> 12:24.785
Whatever. And that's over,
and I no longer want to kiss you

12:24.869 --> 12:25.870
because...

12:26.203 --> 12:29.290
clearly we work better as friends.
Much better. And...

12:31.292 --> 12:33.210
The thing is, I miss my friend.

12:34.044 --> 12:36.547
My awesome, nerdier than me,

12:36.630 --> 12:40.843
possibly even smarter than me,
very much platonic friend.

12:43.471 --> 12:44.471
I'm sorry.

12:45.014 --> 12:48.517
You're right.
I've been pretty... distant lately.

12:49.894 --> 12:52.646
I've just been really busy
helping my mum out at the house.

12:54.648 --> 12:56.442
So, it's not, like, in the main house?

12:56.734 --> 12:58.569
Well, only in the kitchen.

12:58.652 --> 13:02.198
My mum had to take on some extra duties,
so I've been pitching in.

13:02.281 --> 13:05.284
- So you do see Bryce sometimes?
- No, not really.

13:05.367 --> 13:06.827
Not that often.

13:08.078 --> 13:09.205
Right.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.833
Well, it's just the other day
when I dropped you off,

13:12.917 --> 13:14.376
it seemed like he knew you.

13:14.919 --> 13:16.962
Well, he knows who I am.

13:17.588 --> 13:18.588
We've met.

13:19.006 --> 13:20.006
Right.

13:32.019 --> 13:33.062
So, yeah.

13:33.646 --> 13:36.732
I don't really want to speak to you
probably ever again, but...

13:36.816 --> 13:37.983
you should probably see this.

13:38.067 --> 13:39.235
- What is it?
- A letter.

13:39.860 --> 13:41.445
From Mrs. Walker to her son

13:41.529 --> 13:44.169
saying that she hates him
and that she'd be better off without him.

13:45.324 --> 13:49.328
Clay, you don't actually think
Mrs. Walker has anything to do with this?

13:49.411 --> 13:52.331
It's all in there. And it makes
perfect sense when you think about it.

13:52.414 --> 13:53.934
Parents are always the first suspects,

13:53.999 --> 13:57.962
but no one looked at Mrs. Walker
because, well, she's Mrs. Walker.

13:58.045 --> 14:00.214
That's why she's had it out for me
this whole time.

14:00.297 --> 14:01.977
She's trying to pin this whole thing
on me.

14:02.049 --> 14:04.009
- Where did you get this?
- From her desk.

14:04.552 --> 14:05.552
What?

14:06.136 --> 14:07.596
- When?
- This morning.

14:08.347 --> 14:09.849
Clay, you went to...

14:10.391 --> 14:11.725
Are you serious?

14:12.434 --> 14:14.162
- Did my mum see you?
- She answered the door.

14:14.186 --> 14:15.986
I told her I was there
to talk to Mrs. Walker.

14:16.021 --> 14:18.399
Do you have any idea
the trouble you've made for me?

14:18.482 --> 14:21.068
I'm sorry,
I'm about to go to jail for murder.

14:21.527 --> 14:24.029
Can we save the cultural ramifications
of us knowing each other

14:24.113 --> 14:25.632
until after I'm out from under this...

14:25.656 --> 14:28.742
Okay, it's not a cultural thing, Clay!
My mum sat there with the police

14:28.826 --> 14:31.012
and I said I didn't know you,
wasn't caught up with you.

14:31.036 --> 14:33.873
So, that's your story now?
That you don't know me?

14:34.623 --> 14:35.823
What's your story about Bryce?

14:36.500 --> 14:39.128
You never went into the main house?
Your mother kept you apart?

14:39.211 --> 14:41.439
- You're this sheltered little girl...
- You're being crazy!

14:41.463 --> 14:43.303
You've been lying to everybody.
You fucked him!

14:50.347 --> 14:53.392
What did or did not go on
between me and Bryce,

14:53.475 --> 14:56.228
it does neither of us any good
if the whole bloody world knows.

14:56.312 --> 14:57.771
Calm the fuck down!

14:59.523 --> 15:02.526
Zach Dempsey, you're wanted in the office.
Get your things.

15:12.453 --> 15:16.123
The Sheriff's in Bolan's office right now
with our old counselor Mr. Porter,

15:16.206 --> 15:18.208
who I know is going to tell them
that I'm unstable

15:18.292 --> 15:19.652
and that I act out when I'm angry.

15:19.710 --> 15:22.022
And he's pulling in every one
of my friends to back him up.

15:22.046 --> 15:24.298
I do not have time to calm the fuck down.

15:24.882 --> 15:26.342
You're either with me or against me.

15:29.553 --> 15:31.263
Mrs. Walker didn't kill her son.

15:31.347 --> 15:32.348
How do you know?

15:34.141 --> 15:35.643
Tell me, Ani. How do you know?

15:38.103 --> 15:39.897
<i>Clay was grasping for straws,</i>

15:40.522 --> 15:42.232
<i>behaving like a desperate man.</i>

15:42.733 --> 15:44.568
<i>And desperation is dangerous.</i>

15:44.985 --> 15:48.364
When Clay found out that you were
in a relationship with Hannah,

15:48.948 --> 15:51.241
- did he confront you?
- Uh, I guess.

15:51.325 --> 15:52.325
You guess?

15:52.993 --> 15:54.119
Yes. Yeah.

15:54.703 --> 15:55.703
So what happened?

15:55.788 --> 15:56.788
Um...

15:57.081 --> 15:59.333
well, he yelled at me,
but I totally deserved it.

15:59.416 --> 16:02.127
Right, and when he yelled at you,
did he threaten you?

16:02.461 --> 16:04.338
- No.
- Did he attack you?

16:04.421 --> 16:05.339
No.

16:05.422 --> 16:07.007
All right, did he ever apologize?

16:07.091 --> 16:10.260
No disrespect, Mr. Porter,
but why are you asking me this?

16:10.344 --> 16:12.304
I'm just trying
to help the Sheriff understand

16:12.388 --> 16:14.348
everything that happened here
over the past year.

16:14.431 --> 16:16.642
With Hannah?
With what happened to her?

16:16.725 --> 16:18.769
And how that impacted Clay.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.653
Clay and I, we're not friends, really,

16:27.820 --> 16:29.780
and there's a lot of stuff
that we don't agree on,

16:29.822 --> 16:30.822
but...

16:30.906 --> 16:31.906
I respect him.

16:31.949 --> 16:33.033
He is a good person

16:33.117 --> 16:34.493
and he always tells the truth.

16:34.576 --> 16:35.577
So, no...

16:36.286 --> 16:38.664
I didn't need him to apologize to me,
because he was right.

16:48.924 --> 16:51.760
<i>I mean, look, it's high school.</i>

16:52.136 --> 16:55.597
<i>It's hard to know who's on your side.
Even on a good day.</i>

17:11.030 --> 17:12.531
You remember in the audio

17:12.614 --> 17:15.242
when Clay goes over
to Bryce's house to buy drugs?

17:15.534 --> 17:17.536
He was lying. Clay doesn't do drugs.

17:17.618 --> 17:18.996
You never saw Clay use drugs?

17:23.416 --> 17:26.336
All right. In the tape,
he confronts Bryce,

17:27.046 --> 17:29.048
accuses him of sexual assault.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.550
Yeah, which was true. Bryce raped Hannah.

17:31.633 --> 17:34.261
Then it sounds like
Clay escalated the conflict

17:34.344 --> 17:35.512
by throwing the first punch?

17:35.596 --> 17:37.556
Clay didn't go there for revenge.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.142
He allowed himself
to get the shit beat out of him

17:40.225 --> 17:42.686
so we would know the truth,
and I admire him for that.

17:42.770 --> 17:44.480
For taking justice into his own hands?

17:44.563 --> 17:46.356
Alex, he could've gone to an adult.

17:46.815 --> 17:48.108
Hannah went to an adult!

17:49.151 --> 17:50.986
Clay knew
that no one would believe Hannah

17:51.070 --> 17:52.404
unless Bryce confessed.

17:52.488 --> 17:56.700
It was never about hurting Bryce,
it was about justice for Hannah.

18:01.163 --> 18:03.499
<i>I thought Clay was just spinning.</i>

18:05.292 --> 18:08.545
<i>Until I saw the Mr. Porter
they were talking about.</i>

18:18.555 --> 18:20.641
Bryce! Bryce...

18:21.225 --> 18:22.559
You are out of your mind.

18:23.143 --> 18:26.063
You choked me in the boys' room.
You fucking choked me!

18:26.188 --> 18:28.023
I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable.

18:28.107 --> 18:31.068
Uncomfortable? Motherfucker!
You were out of your fucking mind!

18:31.151 --> 18:32.778
Watch your language, young man.

18:34.655 --> 18:36.073
- Fuck this!
- Hey, Bryce.

18:36.156 --> 18:37.199
Bryce!

18:39.785 --> 18:42.079
Mrs. Walker, due respect, I...

18:43.372 --> 18:45.833
I don't think that this was the best idea.

18:45.916 --> 18:48.418
Please, Kevin. I don't know
what else to do at this point.

18:48.502 --> 18:49.502
I'm at my end.

18:49.545 --> 18:51.505
Well, I feel like it could get ugly.

18:53.423 --> 18:54.466
Maybe it has to.

18:59.388 --> 19:01.140
<i>And that changed everything.</i>

19:02.850 --> 19:04.184
<i>Clay released the tapes,</i>

19:04.560 --> 19:05.644
<i>Bryce got off...</i>

19:06.728 --> 19:07.855
<i>Porter got fired.</i>

19:08.647 --> 19:10.691
<i>Porter was part of the damage done.</i>

19:11.400 --> 19:13.110
<i>- He was hurt.</i>
- Hey, Tyler.

19:13.193 --> 19:14.570
<i>Like so many were.</i>

19:34.673 --> 19:36.842
The man in Bolan's office
with the Sheriff,

19:36.925 --> 19:38.725
that's the Mr. Porter
you were talking about?

19:38.802 --> 19:39.720
Yes. Why?

19:39.803 --> 19:41.805
I know him. He's been to the house.

19:42.431 --> 19:44.057
He and Bryce argued.

19:44.141 --> 19:47.978
I believe... I believe Bryce said
something about the man choking him.

19:48.812 --> 19:49.812
And then Bryce left,

19:50.314 --> 19:53.734
and he, Mr. Porter, said to Mrs. Walker,
"It could get ugly."

19:54.776 --> 19:57.362
- What could get ugly?
- I don't know.

19:57.988 --> 19:59.907
Ani, Porter's in there
trying to bring me down.

20:00.032 --> 20:03.452
- Can you remember anything else?
- Or maybe there's more at the house?

20:03.535 --> 20:06.955
Clay, I can't... I can't
just go looking around.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.582
Yeah, right. No, I know.

20:09.374 --> 20:10.876
Your mom, the house...

20:12.461 --> 20:14.838
But you did manage to fuck Bryce
at the house, right?

20:17.549 --> 20:19.134
<i>Was he grasping at straws?</i>

20:19.760 --> 20:22.429
Suspecting Mr. Porter or Mrs. Walker?

20:24.056 --> 20:25.807
Didn't you take a look at them, too?

20:27.309 --> 20:30.312
You're not obligated to answer
any questions and we're not holding you.

20:30.395 --> 20:32.689
We just want to ask you a few questions
about Clay Jensen.

20:32.773 --> 20:34.316
And Tyler Down.

20:35.359 --> 20:37.945
- Okay.
- Are you still friends with Tyler?

20:38.028 --> 20:39.863
- Not really.
- Why not?

20:40.155 --> 20:41.823
I don't know. He changed.

20:42.532 --> 20:44.534
We just... drifted apart.

20:44.743 --> 20:45.827
Changed how?

20:46.411 --> 20:47.496
I don't know exactly.

20:47.579 --> 20:49.581
Then what can you tell us
about Clay Jensen?

20:50.207 --> 20:51.250
He's a good guy.

20:51.875 --> 20:54.920
He's always been really nice to me.
Feels responsible for people.

20:55.003 --> 20:56.755
And he wants to do the right thing.

20:56.922 --> 20:59.216
Tell me about that fight in the hall
last semester.

20:59.549 --> 21:01.593
I started that fight, not Clay.

21:01.885 --> 21:04.263
Bryce lied in court about Hannah.

21:04.346 --> 21:06.431
- And did that make you angry?
- Yes.

21:06.515 --> 21:08.642
- And did it make Clay angry?
- We were all angry.

21:08.725 --> 21:09.851
Things just got out of hand.

21:09.935 --> 21:12.437
Do you think
that Clay took that opportunity

21:12.521 --> 21:14.022
- to attack Bryce?
- No.

21:14.106 --> 21:17.609
He was beating the shit out of me.
Clay tried to pull him off, to protect me.

21:17.693 --> 21:20.696
It feels like Clay went after Bryce
more than once

21:20.779 --> 21:22.406
- in the past year?
- Didn't you?

21:23.323 --> 21:25.450
- We're not talking about me.
- Maybe we should be.

21:25.534 --> 21:27.703
Well, maybe we should be
telling the truth about Clay

21:28.078 --> 21:30.539
and how he brought you back to Evergreen
against your will.

21:30.622 --> 21:31.873
No, he got me off the streets.

21:31.957 --> 21:34.835
He took revenge on Tyler, on Courtney.

21:34.918 --> 21:37.421
No, he tried to get people
to own up to what they did.

21:37.504 --> 21:38.755
- Including you?
- Yeah.

21:38.839 --> 21:41.008
- Including me.
- He acts out of emotion.

21:41.091 --> 21:42.384
He goes after people.

21:42.467 --> 21:44.261
He doesn't "go after people."

21:44.469 --> 21:46.388
He tries to do the right thing, always.

21:46.471 --> 21:48.598
You know that! I don't know what you're...

21:51.935 --> 21:52.936
He's a good person.

21:54.479 --> 21:57.107
And if he acts out of emotion,
it's because he fucking cares!

21:57.190 --> 21:59.818
Which is more than most people
in this fucking school.

22:02.362 --> 22:03.363
He saved my life.

22:06.742 --> 22:08.785
<i>But would Porter
really go after Clay?</i>

22:08.869 --> 22:12.122
He sent around a picture of Tyler
and keyed Zach's car.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.417
He wanted people
to feel the way Hannah did.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.753
- But did Clay ever confront you?
- No.

22:17.836 --> 22:21.715
When he heard my tape, he told me
he'd burn the tapes if I wanted him to.

22:21.798 --> 22:24.593
But then he published Hannah's tapes,
violating your privacy?

22:24.676 --> 22:26.762
No! He asked me first.

22:26.845 --> 22:28.388
But then he put pressure on you

22:28.472 --> 22:30.223
to go to the police and to testify?

22:30.307 --> 22:33.894
He believed I was strong enough
to tell my story even when I didn't.

22:33.977 --> 22:36.188
- But he put pressure on you?
- So did you!

22:37.230 --> 22:41.234
And look, if I never tell my story,
Bryce never gets arrested, so...

22:41.318 --> 22:43.445
So, what? The ends justify the means

22:43.528 --> 22:45.364
and what he did is okay?

22:45.447 --> 22:46.447
No,

22:46.698 --> 22:48.325
it makes it not black and white.

22:49.409 --> 22:54.164
You want to paint him as this bad guy,
but the fact is, he's not.

22:59.169 --> 23:03.340
<i>History between two people
can be an explosive thing.</i>

23:37.249 --> 23:38.250
Five more minutes.

23:38.333 --> 23:41.586
Well, if I stay any later,
I'll turn into a pumpkin.

23:41.962 --> 23:43.338
And then where would we be?

23:43.964 --> 23:45.799
But you got here so late.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.635
You didn't even have time for poker.

23:50.345 --> 23:52.639
We barely even got a chance to talk.

23:53.557 --> 23:57.727
Well, you didn't seem to mind the whole
not talking thing last night, as I recall.

24:01.273 --> 24:02.482
So, then,

24:03.066 --> 24:04.901
let's not talk some more.

24:04.985 --> 24:05.985
I know.

24:06.653 --> 24:08.071
But it's laundry day.

24:08.697 --> 24:09.697
So...

24:10.073 --> 24:13.160
I have to get the clothes in the wash
by the time my mother is up.

24:13.243 --> 24:14.703
Just tell her you slept in.

24:14.953 --> 24:17.414
Tell her the washing machine broke.

24:17.497 --> 24:20.709
I don't know. She always believes
whatever lies you make up anyway.

24:24.588 --> 24:25.588
My mother trusts me

24:25.630 --> 24:28.842
because when I say I'll do the laundry,
I make sure that the laundry is done.

24:29.718 --> 24:30.718
No, I know.

24:31.720 --> 24:32.720
I just mean that...

24:33.638 --> 24:36.850
you always worry about your mom,
and then you figure it out.

24:38.143 --> 24:40.812
- I didn't mean anything bad by it.
- I know you didn't.

24:41.396 --> 24:42.397
So, stay.

24:44.232 --> 24:45.232
I need you.

24:47.110 --> 24:48.110
You shouldn't.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.928
<i>So, what went on
between Porter and Bryce?</i>

25:16.014 --> 25:17.014
Jesus!

25:17.516 --> 25:19.351
Mr. Jensen, I think we should talk.

25:19.643 --> 25:20.936
Why should I talk to you?

25:23.438 --> 25:24.940
Hey. Maybe I can help.

25:26.149 --> 25:27.234
You're trying to set me up.

25:27.317 --> 25:28.610
You think that's what I'm doing?

25:28.693 --> 25:30.445
So they won't look at you or Mrs. Walker.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.989
They've already looked at me
and Mrs. Walker.

25:33.490 --> 25:35.742
And I think they decided
that they have their man,

25:35.825 --> 25:36.826
and that's you.

25:37.285 --> 25:40.205
But they don't know about you
and Bryce, at his house, do they?

25:41.540 --> 25:42.707
What do you know about that?

25:42.791 --> 25:45.043
I know that you and Bryce were in contact.

25:45.252 --> 25:47.963
I know that you talked to Mrs. Walker
about what to do about him,

25:48.046 --> 25:49.381
and a few weeks later, he's dead.

25:51.967 --> 25:53.802
I imagine you have some questions.

25:55.136 --> 25:58.515
I'm at the family counseling center,
doing field work for my degree.

25:59.641 --> 26:01.768
Call me when you want to talk.

26:07.983 --> 26:08.984
You know, I thought...

26:10.235 --> 26:13.238
even after everything,
I thought you were a good person.

26:13.947 --> 26:15.407
I thought you cared about kids.

26:16.324 --> 26:17.867
What the fuck happened to you?

26:27.419 --> 26:28.920
Porter was trying to help him.

26:30.005 --> 26:31.089
What? How do you know?

26:31.840 --> 26:33.425
I saw Porter with a journal.

26:33.883 --> 26:35.594
Bryce had one just like it.

26:36.428 --> 26:39.014
It's not a coincidence.
Porter gave it to him.

26:40.515 --> 26:41.766
What does that prove?

26:42.309 --> 26:43.309
Nothing.

26:43.727 --> 26:44.727
Till you read it.

26:57.449 --> 27:00.702
- What's it say?
- It says Porter got him to keep a journal,

27:01.036 --> 27:02.078
for therapy.

27:03.330 --> 27:04.998
And I should warn you,
there are...

27:05.707 --> 27:07.347
There are things you won't like in there.

27:07.751 --> 27:08.751
About you?

27:10.211 --> 27:11.211
Yes.

27:14.132 --> 27:17.135
And about Bryce.
About who he was becoming before he died.

27:17.886 --> 27:18.886
What about the letter?

27:19.971 --> 27:20.971
I don't know.

27:21.556 --> 27:22.599
Maybe Porter does.

27:24.059 --> 27:26.645
Why are you helping me
if you think I'm a murderer?

27:27.103 --> 27:27.937
Uh...

27:28.063 --> 27:29.147
I don't know what to think.

27:29.230 --> 27:31.775
You can believe the best of Bryce
but the worst of me?

27:34.152 --> 27:38.114
I'm afraid I believe
we're all capable of the very worst.

27:39.658 --> 27:40.658
Including you?

27:49.668 --> 27:52.295
<i>Of course I wanted to believe
that Clay was innocent.</i>

27:53.254 --> 27:55.048
Because if Clay did kill Bryce...

27:57.467 --> 27:58.677
he did it because of me.

28:02.931 --> 28:05.100
So, you were counseling him?

28:05.809 --> 28:07.977
After I left Liberty,
I went back to school,

28:08.853 --> 28:10.313
for my Master's in social work.

28:11.272 --> 28:14.317
I was doing intern hours
at the family counseling center,

28:14.526 --> 28:15.527
like I told you.

28:15.610 --> 28:17.612
Mrs. Walker, she tracked me down there.

28:17.696 --> 28:18.947
You specifically?

28:19.906 --> 28:21.032
Why not a real therapist?

28:21.408 --> 28:22.242
Hmm.

28:22.325 --> 28:24.953
Bryce had been to three already,
and fooled them all.

28:25.412 --> 28:27.288
And she knew he wasn't gonna fool me.

28:27.372 --> 28:29.499
And I guess
we both had something to prove.

28:31.126 --> 28:33.962
- And the journal? You gave it to him?
- Yes.

28:34.629 --> 28:36.464
We met here, as a matter of fact.

28:38.883 --> 28:40.009
Uh...

28:41.010 --> 28:42.010
Thanks.

28:43.138 --> 28:47.434
I want you to keep a journal, day by day,
while we're working together.

28:47.517 --> 28:49.394
- Like a diary?
- It doesn't have to be.

28:49.686 --> 28:52.021
Just thoughts, things that you notice.

28:52.647 --> 28:55.650
Take inventory of your feelings,
what you would like to work on.

28:56.609 --> 28:57.609
It's...

28:59.279 --> 29:01.197
I don't know, it's got a maze on it.

29:01.281 --> 29:03.116
It's a labyrinth, not a maze.

29:03.825 --> 29:04.951
It's a sacred pattern.

29:05.535 --> 29:08.580
A maze, you get lost.
A labyrinth, you find yourself.

29:10.623 --> 29:11.624
I'm curious, Bryce.

29:12.542 --> 29:14.335
Last time I was at your house,

29:14.419 --> 29:16.463
you made it pretty clear

29:17.172 --> 29:18.965
you had no interest in talking with me.

29:19.048 --> 29:20.049
What changed?

29:21.760 --> 29:24.387
I... I wanna do better, I guess.

29:28.391 --> 29:29.392
There's this girl.

29:29.893 --> 29:31.728
She goes to Claremont Prep.

29:32.437 --> 29:33.646
She's incredible,

29:33.730 --> 29:37.942
and I'm already fucking it up with her
'cause I don't know how to be...

29:39.235 --> 29:40.278
like...

29:41.321 --> 29:43.698
- a human being.
- I see.

29:44.115 --> 29:47.160
And is this true
with your other relationships?

29:49.871 --> 29:52.332
How are things with you and your mom?

29:54.334 --> 29:58.379
Some days she acknowledges my existence,
some days she doesn't.

29:59.255 --> 30:01.800
And you think this is all on her?

30:11.559 --> 30:14.771
She didn't really want to help him.
I mean, not if she hired you.

30:15.438 --> 30:16.856
Yeah. Well, thanks for that.

30:16.940 --> 30:18.566
- I mean...
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

30:19.150 --> 30:21.778
But she did.
And she wanted him to get better.

30:22.153 --> 30:23.153
No, but...

30:25.907 --> 30:27.617
But she wrote this.

30:29.118 --> 30:30.118
No, she didn't.

30:31.955 --> 30:35.542
But... the letter is from her,
about how much she hated him.

30:37.168 --> 30:38.878
"He was always a bad kid.

30:40.338 --> 30:42.715
Always tracking mud on the white carpets.

30:43.132 --> 30:46.845
Or having temper tantrums
in the middle of our dinner parties.

30:47.804 --> 30:50.598
Or wetting the bed
when we were on vacation

30:50.682 --> 30:52.976
in some five-star hotel.

30:53.560 --> 30:55.603
Or throwing all his new toys
in the garbage

30:55.687 --> 30:57.939
and telling the maid
that he was running away.

30:59.315 --> 31:02.318
And now
he's made a total mess of his life.

31:03.611 --> 31:05.371
His father doesn't want him.

31:06.614 --> 31:07.991
His classmates hate him.

31:08.533 --> 31:10.702
The rest of the world
thinks he's a monster.

31:12.036 --> 31:13.037
But I'm his mother,

31:13.121 --> 31:15.582
so I'm supposed to put aside
his terrible behavior

31:16.124 --> 31:18.459
and take him in
even when no one else will.

31:22.297 --> 31:24.382
But the truth is, I've never loved him...

31:25.758 --> 31:28.362
because he's never been anything
but a burden and an embarrassment,

31:28.386 --> 31:29.866
and my life would...

31:30.263 --> 31:31.943
...would be better off without him in it."

31:35.226 --> 31:37.854
Talk to me
about what you're feeling just now.

31:39.939 --> 31:41.232
It made me...

31:42.025 --> 31:43.818
feel sad, I guess.

31:44.861 --> 31:47.071
Growing up,
my parents weren't around much.

31:48.698 --> 31:51.784
Or ever. Everyone thinks that's so cool
when you're in high school,

31:51.868 --> 31:54.162
'cause you can have parties
whenever you want.

31:55.580 --> 31:58.541
But when you're a kid,
it's fucking lonely.

32:00.835 --> 32:06.049
Bryce, it might be beneficial,
at some point, to bring your mom in here,

32:06.841 --> 32:09.594
now that you've written
from her perspective.

32:10.428 --> 32:11.971
And it might seem daunting...

32:13.014 --> 32:15.558
but would you be willing
to share some of this with her?

32:21.064 --> 32:24.609
Aren't you violating, like,
doctor-patient confidentiality?

32:24.734 --> 32:26.903
Well, he's dead. And...

32:27.487 --> 32:28.655
I'm not a doctor.

32:29.656 --> 32:30.907
And you have his journal

32:30.990 --> 32:32.492
and the letter that he wrote.

32:54.430 --> 32:56.474
Take your time, Mrs. Walker.
That's a...

32:57.433 --> 32:58.726
lot to process.

32:59.936 --> 33:04.315
I know things have never been easy
between Bryce and myself.

33:06.776 --> 33:09.153
But I had no idea
he thought I felt this way.

33:09.821 --> 33:13.866
Would you like to tell him
how you do feel about him?

33:16.119 --> 33:17.286
Your father and I...

33:18.830 --> 33:21.332
we always tried
to give you the best of everything.

33:22.208 --> 33:24.544
That's how we showed you
how much you meant to us.

33:27.130 --> 33:28.881
I suppose it's how I was raised.

33:28.965 --> 33:31.342
- So, it's all Grandpa's fault?
- Bryce.

33:32.218 --> 33:33.302
You're listening now.

33:34.887 --> 33:35.887
Go on, Mrs. Walker.

33:37.265 --> 33:39.100
I suppose growing up...

33:40.643 --> 33:43.021
I never really pictured myself
as a mother.

33:43.855 --> 33:47.275
In part, yes,
because of the kind of parents I had,

33:47.859 --> 33:49.068
the house I grew up in.

33:51.738 --> 33:53.823
It was such a difficult pregnancy.

33:55.450 --> 33:56.743
I wasn't prepared.

33:57.660 --> 34:00.830
I guess I just wanted the baby to be born,

34:01.456 --> 34:02.665
to get it done.

34:04.792 --> 34:05.793
And after the baby...

34:07.962 --> 34:09.338
After you were born...

34:12.842 --> 34:14.719
I just fell into a depression.

34:15.428 --> 34:17.597
And by the time I made my way out,

34:17.679 --> 34:19.806
it was like you didn't need me anymore.

34:20.641 --> 34:23.226
Like somehow you rejected me.

34:24.145 --> 34:27.398
And all the fears I had
about being a terrible mother...

34:28.815 --> 34:29.815
confirmed.

34:31.235 --> 34:33.071
I know... I know it's ridiculous.

34:35.281 --> 34:36.574
A little baby boy...

34:38.117 --> 34:40.661
who I should have held and loved.

34:43.956 --> 34:45.917
And I just didn't know how.

34:48.585 --> 34:49.670
Bryce...

34:50.588 --> 34:51.839
how does that make you feel?

34:55.842 --> 34:57.053
Um...

34:59.138 --> 35:00.139
I... I don't know.

35:01.849 --> 35:03.851
It's okay not to know.

35:05.228 --> 35:07.897
And I didn't really care
about the...

35:08.481 --> 35:10.233
fucking white carpets,

35:10.608 --> 35:12.235
and that's what you remember?

35:14.904 --> 35:16.280
It breaks my heart.

35:21.494 --> 35:23.663
<i>Bryce and his mother broke through.</i>

35:30.670 --> 35:33.172
You mentioned a girl from Claremont,
I think?

35:34.215 --> 35:35.215
I, uh...

35:35.508 --> 35:37.635
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

35:39.011 --> 35:40.638
She's a really great girl.

35:41.931 --> 35:43.432
I just don't want to hurt her.

35:43.891 --> 35:44.891
Mm-hmm.

35:45.059 --> 35:48.354
You don't want to hurt her physically
or emotionally?

35:48.437 --> 35:52.733
I don't know, I just... I don't want
to do anything wrong with her.

35:52.817 --> 35:54.235
I want to be better for her.

35:55.069 --> 35:58.114
But you're still having
these intrusive thoughts?

35:58.865 --> 36:01.492
We've had sex a few times.

36:02.243 --> 36:03.661
She wants to be on top,

36:03.953 --> 36:05.621
which is cool, but I...

36:07.874 --> 36:10.001
Um, I... It's...
We're doing it,

36:10.084 --> 36:13.796
and, yeah, I just,
I can't get these thoughts out of my mind

36:13.880 --> 36:14.880
about...

36:15.089 --> 36:18.134
being on top of her,
forcing her down or...

36:21.470 --> 36:22.638
or choking her.

36:25.057 --> 36:28.144
Which, I promise, I didn't want to do,
I would never.

36:28.227 --> 36:31.731
I just...
I can't get these thoughts out of my mind.

36:31.814 --> 36:33.149
It's so fucked up.

36:34.275 --> 36:37.028
Bryce, I don't think
that you should be dating right now.

36:37.445 --> 36:40.698
Or having any kind of sex.
I don't think that you're ready.

36:40.781 --> 36:42.825
But... but this girl, she's different.

36:42.909 --> 36:44.368
She makes me better.

36:44.452 --> 36:45.912
No, she can't do that.

36:46.787 --> 36:47.787
Only you can.

36:48.331 --> 36:50.124
We need to get you in a program.

36:50.708 --> 36:53.920
There are some emotional issues
that you need to deal with,

36:54.378 --> 36:56.464
cognitive behavior therapy.

36:57.048 --> 36:59.091
And I can get you some referrals.

37:00.134 --> 37:01.134
So, I'm...

37:02.178 --> 37:03.262
I'm fucked...

37:04.013 --> 37:04.889
forever, right?

37:04.972 --> 37:07.850
I'm going to be a rapist
for the rest of my life.

37:07.934 --> 37:09.060
I'll never get better.

37:10.186 --> 37:11.520
I don't believe that's true.

37:17.360 --> 37:18.861
I gave him some referrals

37:18.945 --> 37:21.405
and, to the best of my knowledge,
he never went.

37:23.282 --> 37:24.617
Did he break up with her?

37:25.576 --> 37:26.827
The... girl?

37:27.870 --> 37:28.955
I don't know.

37:29.372 --> 37:30.998
That was the last time I saw him.

37:33.167 --> 37:34.835
So if you've got nothing to hide,

37:35.753 --> 37:37.755
how come you're helping the cops
set me up?

37:37.838 --> 37:40.967
I'm not, Clay. They wanted me
to help them make their case.

37:41.050 --> 37:42.677
But I know you,

37:43.344 --> 37:45.221
and I believe that I know your heart.

37:45.596 --> 37:49.183
So, I called kids
who I hoped would stand up for you,

37:49.433 --> 37:50.433
and they did.

37:51.686 --> 37:53.166
And I'm just supposed to believe you?

37:53.229 --> 37:55.523
- That you're trying to help?
- That's up to you, Clay.

37:56.524 --> 37:59.735
Now, I know from experience
that it's hard to trust anyone,

38:00.736 --> 38:02.947
but there are people
that are on your side.

38:07.952 --> 38:09.203
And there's one other thing.

38:09.829 --> 38:11.539
When I spoke to Tyler today,

38:11.622 --> 38:15.584
there was something different about him
since I saw him last year.

38:20.131 --> 38:21.966
Yeah. He's, uh...

38:22.925 --> 38:23.926
He's been through a lot.

38:24.427 --> 38:26.679
But have you seen any sudden change
in behavior?

38:27.513 --> 38:29.348
Did you notice anything like that?

38:30.224 --> 38:32.727
- Sudden change?
- He's been through trauma.

38:33.436 --> 38:37.106
And I bet you money Montgomery de la Cruz
has something to do with that.

38:40.568 --> 38:42.653
Just watch out for him, okay?

38:43.279 --> 38:44.279
I will.

38:45.114 --> 38:46.114
I promise.

38:49.076 --> 38:50.494
I just told them the truth.

38:50.911 --> 38:53.289
I mean, not the whole truth,
but the truth.

38:53.372 --> 38:55.666
That... you're a good person.

38:57.043 --> 38:58.043
Thanks, Tyler.

38:58.753 --> 38:59.753
Yeah.

39:01.297 --> 39:03.841
How about you? How are you doing?
Everything okay?

39:04.258 --> 39:05.968
Pretty much, yeah. Why?

39:06.093 --> 39:08.804
Look, I'm sorry
that I haven't been around much lately.

39:08.888 --> 39:10.848
You've got some stuff going on, so...

39:11.098 --> 39:12.098
Yeah.

39:13.225 --> 39:14.225
Yeah.

39:17.480 --> 39:18.731
Tyler...

39:20.066 --> 39:21.567
did Monty do something to you?

39:23.235 --> 39:25.404
What? What do you mean?

39:27.198 --> 39:28.282
I think...

39:28.824 --> 39:30.326
you've been through something

39:31.202 --> 39:32.411
you haven't told anyone.

39:32.703 --> 39:33.746
Maybe last spring?

39:35.247 --> 39:37.291
No. No.

39:39.001 --> 39:42.129
I mean, not... not really.
Who have you been talking to?

39:44.924 --> 39:46.050
Mr. Porter...

39:46.967 --> 39:48.636
noticed some things today.

39:50.471 --> 39:51.931
But I've noticed some things, too.

39:55.559 --> 39:57.144
You don't want anyone to touch you.

39:58.437 --> 39:59.980
You won't use the bathrooms.

40:00.940 --> 40:02.358
You wanted to die.

40:08.948 --> 40:09.948
Ty...

40:11.659 --> 40:12.868
Tyler, what is it?

40:13.452 --> 40:15.204
I... I can't.

40:15.955 --> 40:18.791
- I can't.
- Okay. Okay, you don't have to.

40:19.500 --> 40:21.085
Okay.

40:24.547 --> 40:25.798
But you <i>can </i> tell me.

40:26.465 --> 40:27.550
You know that, right?

40:27.800 --> 40:29.135
You know I care about you.

40:30.928 --> 40:33.097
And at this point,
you can tell me anything.

40:52.533 --> 40:53.533
I...

40:54.785 --> 40:56.162
I was...

40:58.164 --> 40:59.999
I was in the bathroom...

41:00.916 --> 41:05.045
when I got back from my diversion program.

41:06.046 --> 41:07.590
Monty came in and he...

41:08.799 --> 41:11.594
He was mad about the field and he... he...

41:12.178 --> 41:17.141
smashed my head on the mirror
and on the sink.

41:17.224 --> 41:21.479
And then, he and... Taylor and Kenneth...

41:22.605 --> 41:25.441
they held my head in the toilet.

41:25.524 --> 41:26.524
And...

41:28.736 --> 41:29.736
Monty...

41:31.280 --> 41:35.075
he got a mop, and he...

41:38.120 --> 41:42.166
He pulled my pants down, and he put it...

41:43.626 --> 41:45.836
in...in me.

41:46.629 --> 41:47.671
And he...

41:49.423 --> 41:50.633
pushed it in

41:51.217 --> 41:52.426
my hole, and...

41:53.010 --> 41:56.055
and in and out, until I was...

41:56.764 --> 41:58.766
bleeding, and they...

42:00.976 --> 42:02.895
And they left me on the floor.

42:06.690 --> 42:08.442
Oh, God!

42:09.568 --> 42:10.778
Oh, Jesus. Tyler.

42:16.075 --> 42:19.245
Tyler, I am...
I'm so sorry that happened to you.

42:24.458 --> 42:25.543
I feel like...

42:27.878 --> 42:29.588
I feel like I want to hug you right now.

42:30.339 --> 42:32.591
Would that be all right, if I hug you?

42:35.844 --> 42:36.844
Mm-hmm.

42:54.113 --> 42:56.448
It's all right, man.

42:58.200 --> 42:59.285
It's all right.

43:01.870 --> 43:02.913
It's okay.

43:11.422 --> 43:12.631
- Here.
- Thank you.

43:17.344 --> 43:19.263
Tyler, do you want to tell someone?

43:20.014 --> 43:21.265
An adult?

43:23.601 --> 43:24.685
I told Bryce.

43:25.936 --> 43:27.104
- Bryce?
- Yeah, he...

43:27.771 --> 43:29.481
came to see me a couple weeks ago.

43:29.732 --> 43:30.733
He wanted to know

43:31.358 --> 43:32.358
what Monty did.

43:33.485 --> 43:35.446
I finally got up the guts to tell him.

43:36.447 --> 43:37.573
He was shocked.

43:38.032 --> 43:39.450
He was actually upset.

43:39.700 --> 43:41.702
And he asked if I wanted his help.

43:42.620 --> 43:44.747
Bryce offer... offered to help?

43:46.206 --> 43:47.583
He left me a voicemail

43:47.833 --> 43:49.043
just before he died.

43:49.376 --> 43:50.502
<i>Tyler.</i>

43:50.586 --> 43:52.630
<i>It's Bryce... Walker.</i>

43:53.672 --> 43:57.551
<i>Listen, that thing we talked about,
I'm dealing with it.</i>

43:57.968 --> 44:00.179
<i>You're all good.
Take care of yourself, man.</i>

44:02.514 --> 44:04.767
Tyler, if he went to Monty about this...

44:06.226 --> 44:08.395
and threatened to turn him in...

44:09.438 --> 44:11.398
- we have to tell somebody.
<i>- </i> No!

44:12.441 --> 44:14.526
No, please. Clay, I can't.

44:15.819 --> 44:16.819
No.

44:17.696 --> 44:18.696
No, of course not.

44:20.324 --> 44:21.158
Okay.

44:21.241 --> 44:23.327
You don't have to tell anyone
until you're ready.

44:23.827 --> 44:24.870
But please...

44:26.038 --> 44:27.289
ask for help when you need it.

44:27.706 --> 44:28.706
Okay?

44:31.001 --> 44:32.001
Please?

44:33.170 --> 44:34.170
Okay.

44:40.844 --> 44:41.844
Hey!

44:42.179 --> 44:43.179
Monty!

44:45.265 --> 44:46.642
Didn't they arrest you yet?

44:46.934 --> 44:49.228
No, but I hope they'll be coming for you.

44:50.354 --> 44:51.563
The fuck does that mean?

44:52.147 --> 44:53.857
Where were you after Homecoming?

44:54.358 --> 44:55.943
Did Bryce talk to you after the game?

44:56.360 --> 44:57.444
Did something happen?

44:57.569 --> 44:59.947
What are you talking about?
I was with the boys all night.

45:00.030 --> 45:01.615
We got shit-faced at Charlie's.

45:01.782 --> 45:03.462
Cops already checked into it.
I'm all good.

45:04.118 --> 45:05.398
You're the one who's in trouble.

45:05.452 --> 45:08.122
But I didn't do anything,
and I know you did.

45:10.124 --> 45:11.124
Yeah?

45:11.333 --> 45:12.584
Well, what the fuck did I do?

45:17.506 --> 45:21.301
If you're trying to clear your name,
you need to look a little closer to home.

45:21.635 --> 45:23.554
You know Bryce and Justin
went at it that night?

45:25.848 --> 45:28.088
You don't know what you're talking about.

45:28.642 --> 45:30.018
You think you know him,

45:30.102 --> 45:32.646
but he's playing you,
like he played Bryce.

45:32.938 --> 45:33.981
It's what he does.

45:34.565 --> 45:36.817
And he's going to play you right to jail.

45:38.318 --> 45:39.653
You are so full of shit!

45:42.114 --> 45:44.450
Your boy Justin,
he shaves with electric, right?

45:46.910 --> 45:48.078
I think so. Why?

45:48.996 --> 45:51.665
Then why has he got a can
of shaving cream in his bag?

45:52.958 --> 45:55.419
Ha! You should check that shit out.

45:58.297 --> 46:01.091
<i>Who to trust? Who to believe?</i>

46:03.469 --> 46:05.721
Well, they pulled in Tyler, Jessica...

46:07.347 --> 46:08.348
everyone.

46:08.515 --> 46:09.600
It's a dirty way to do it.

46:09.933 --> 46:12.394
Mr. Porter said
most of the people defended me.

46:13.061 --> 46:16.231
He said he was trying to get them to say
good things about me the whole time.

46:16.315 --> 46:17.441
Who knows if it's true?

46:18.192 --> 46:20.527
Shit! It's true.

46:20.611 --> 46:23.238
He kept trying to get me
to get angry at him,

46:23.322 --> 46:25.532
and then he smiled and nodded at me.

46:25.616 --> 46:26.616
I...

46:27.242 --> 46:29.453
couldn't figure out why,
but that's why.

46:30.579 --> 46:33.207
Look, they may have tried
to defend you, Clay,

46:33.540 --> 46:36.835
but any statement they made
about your history with Bryce

46:36.919 --> 46:38.420
can still be used against you.

46:39.213 --> 46:41.566
They're building a case against you
and they're moving fast,

46:41.590 --> 46:44.635
- so, we need to be talking next steps.
- What does that mean?

46:44.718 --> 46:46.637
Well, in the absence of another suspect,

46:46.720 --> 46:48.680
we need to focus on a strategy
for your defense.

46:49.264 --> 46:51.600
This is just to be prepared.
That's all, Clay.

46:53.602 --> 46:54.728
Montgomery de la Cruz.

46:55.020 --> 46:57.580
They need to be looking at Monty,
he had something to do with it.

46:57.606 --> 46:58.982
Why do you think so?

46:59.691 --> 47:00.691
I can't...

47:01.485 --> 47:03.320
I can't say, but I know.

47:04.613 --> 47:05.697
Why can't you say?

47:08.826 --> 47:10.828
Clay, if you know something, anything

47:11.119 --> 47:13.956
about anyone who might be implicated
in this,

47:14.623 --> 47:15.874
now is the time.

47:19.378 --> 47:20.504
Someone did this.

47:21.797 --> 47:22.797
It wasn't me.

47:24.383 --> 47:25.383
Then who?

47:29.847 --> 47:31.390
<i>So, Clay was back at square.</i>

47:33.392 --> 47:34.393
<i>But not quite.</i>

47:37.771 --> 47:39.356
<i>He knew Monty had a motive,</i>

47:40.274 --> 47:42.025
<i>that he was caught up with Bryce.</i>

48:19.688 --> 48:21.315
<i>But Monty wasn't the only one.</i>
