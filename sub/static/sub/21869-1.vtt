Anything new at school?

01:28.796 --> 01:29.928
Don't be mean.

01:29.930 --> 01:32.297
- I was serious.
- So was I.

01:32.299 --> 01:34.833
I'm switching from agriscience
to robotics.

01:34.835 --> 01:37.669
Bringing a chicken to school
was nothing but trouble.

01:37.671 --> 01:39.937
Hey, don't bring that thing
through the kitchen.

01:39.939 --> 01:41.306
Health inspector.

01:41.308 --> 01:44.443
Dead chicken, yes.
Live chicken, no.

01:44.445 --> 01:46.944
He can ride
home in the car with me.

01:46.946 --> 01:47.946

01:47.948 --> 01:49.850

Dinner!

02:30.857 --> 02:31.890
How was school?

02:31.892 --> 02:33.258
Same ole, same ole.

02:33.260 --> 02:35.393
- How about you, honey?
- Good.

02:35.395 --> 02:37.563
Baby girl, didn't I see you
leave here this morning

02:37.565 --> 02:38.597
with a chicken?

02:38.599 --> 02:40.231
Ask Mama
what she did with him.

02:40.233 --> 02:43.100
Sid's bringing by
more sweet potatoes on the 14th.

02:43.102 --> 02:45.337
The 16th is Daddy's
birthday.

02:45.339 --> 02:47.338
Well, I'll make a cake.

02:47.340 --> 02:50.742
We'll find a way
to make the day special.

02:50.744 --> 02:53.347
I'm gonna go take my bath.
I ate at the café.

02:58.851 --> 03:01.253
I wish Mama would talk more
about Daddy.

03:01.255 --> 03:03.389
Well, she's looking forward,
not backwards.

03:03.391 --> 03:06.094
And he's with you
every step of every day.

03:07.627 --> 03:10.361
I hope he's not as bored
as we are.

03:10.363 --> 03:13.366
And y'all got your
singing voices from your daddy.

03:13.368 --> 03:15.234
He used to sing
in his church choir

03:15.236 --> 03:16.735
just like you two.

03:16.737 --> 03:18.369
We're hoping
for bigger audiences

03:18.371 --> 03:19.872
than Methodists, Meemaw.

03:19.874 --> 03:23.543
Don't you be running down
local church folk.

03:36.055 --> 03:38.390
What was Daddy's favorite color?

03:38.392 --> 03:40.825
Green, I think.

03:40.827 --> 03:43.729
You said blue
last time I asked.

03:43.731 --> 03:45.566
He probably had a lot
of favorites.

03:48.901 --> 03:51.802
What you doing?

03:51.804 --> 03:53.907
Yeah. Willie.

04:49.863 --> 04:52.031
- once that brunch crowd fed.
- Flood!

04:52.033 --> 04:54.332
Oh, my Lord.

04:54.334 --> 04:57.736
- Oh, Lordy, Lordy.
- Look at all that water.

04:57.738 --> 04:59.471
Hey, that water pipe is busted.

04:59.473 --> 05:02.541
- Where's the water coming from?
- One busted pipe made all this?

05:02.543 --> 05:04.342
Let me get the...
Let me get the valve.

05:04.344 --> 05:05.710
Whoa.

05:05.712 --> 05:07.481
- Is it off?
- I'm trying.

05:10.317 --> 05:12.984
All right, here. Grab this.

05:12.986 --> 05:14.755
- There you are.
- Give me one.

05:16.156 --> 05:18.022
- All right. Hurry, hurry.
- There.

05:18.024 --> 05:20.227
Got it?

05:32.406 --> 05:35.741
<i>Brian Quinlan Spencer
was a staff sergeant</i>

05:35.743 --> 05:38.243
<i>in the United States
Marine Corps,</i>

05:38.245 --> 05:39.611

<i>in Karabilah, Iraq,</i>

06:06.639 --> 06:09.707
<i>an enemy soldier

06:09.709 --> 06:12.544
<i>Other Marines watched
as Spencer sacrificed himself</i>

06:12.546 --> 06:15.214
<i>and dove on the grenade.</i>

06:15.216 --> 06:17.483
<i>On November 10th, 2004,</i>

06:17.485 --> 06:21.489
<i>Staff Sergeant Spencer
was awarded the Silver Star.</i>

06:25.659 --> 06:27.092
It was just right there.

06:27.094 --> 06:28.493
A whole page
about the battle.

06:28.495 --> 06:30.462
With names of Marines.

06:30.464 --> 06:31.895
That's insane.

06:31.897 --> 06:35.467
I kept searching and I found
the name of this guy.

06:35.469 --> 06:39.404
Mr. Henry LaRue Monroe.

06:39.406 --> 06:43.741
He was next to my daddy that day
and he survived.

06:43.743 --> 06:44.943
Holy moly.

06:44.945 --> 06:47.311
Got an address for him.

06:47.313 --> 06:49.580
And he's here. In Tennessee.

06:49.582 --> 06:51.116
- No way.
- What?

06:51.118 --> 06:52.584
What part of Tennessee.

06:52.586 --> 06:54.318
Down Route 269.

06:54.320 --> 06:56.755
Just 30 miles from here,
at a state veterans' home.

06:56.757 --> 06:58.623
Oh, he's practically
a neighbor.

06:58.625 --> 07:00.291
I knew my daddy
was a hero and all,

07:00.293 --> 07:02.327
but no one in my house

07:02.329 --> 07:04.195
- wants to talk about it.
- Yeah.

07:04.197 --> 07:06.198
You're gonna tell your mom
about Monroe?

07:06.200 --> 07:09.299
- Hell, no.
- Why kick the hornet's nest?

07:09.301 --> 07:12.438
Hey. Why don't you and I
borrow your daddy's truck

07:12.440 --> 07:14.772
and just the two of us
pay the man a visit?

07:14.774 --> 07:15.840
What?

07:15.842 --> 07:18.777
Come on.
You don't wanna meet Mr. Monroe?

07:18.779 --> 07:21.712
I mean, he's your big discovery,
not mine.

07:21.714 --> 07:25.519
I know all I need to know
about my family.

07:29.288 --> 07:31.856
But I can drive you
over there.

07:31.858 --> 07:33.125
Heh. Thanks.

07:33.127 --> 07:34.460
But you owe me.

07:34.462 --> 07:35.827
- Uh-huh.
- Mm-hm.

07:37.865 --> 07:39.634
Wait.

07:50.877 --> 07:52.176
What you doing?

07:52.178 --> 07:54.313
You can see what I'm doing.

07:54.315 --> 07:57.582
No. I mean why you got
Daddy's military papers

07:57.584 --> 07:58.683
hidden under your bed.

07:58.685 --> 08:00.154
Shut the door.

08:04.257 --> 08:07.024
You got no right
snooping in here.

08:07.026 --> 08:08.728
I didn't tell.

08:11.164 --> 08:14.099
Tomorrow, I'm gonna meet a man
who was with Daddy

08:14.101 --> 08:15.834
in the Marines in Iraq.

08:15.836 --> 08:17.835
Sam Hill.

08:17.837 --> 08:19.203
I'm going too.

08:19.205 --> 08:20.505
Watch your mouth,
young lady.

08:20.507 --> 08:22.440
We're a team.

08:22.442 --> 08:23.741
Remember?

08:23.743 --> 08:25.010
Relax.

08:25.012 --> 08:27.411
You've got a part to play
in all this.

08:27.413 --> 08:30.515
You bet I do.

08:30.517 --> 08:32.717
Where you going?

08:32.719 --> 08:36.855
Tomorrow we're going
to Justine's

08:36.857 --> 08:40.292
and she's gonna let me ride
her paint horse.

08:40.294 --> 08:41.625
She is?

08:41.626 --> 08:42.860
Mm.

08:42.861 --> 08:45.264
In exchange for a pie.

08:45.266 --> 08:46.267
Wanna come?

08:51.637 --> 08:53.571
Taking any longer?

08:53.573 --> 08:54.572
Hey, hey, hey...

08:54.574 --> 08:55.774
Pies.

08:55.776 --> 08:57.207
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Bye.

08:57.209 --> 08:59.611
Bye-bye.

08:59.613 --> 09:01.713
They're awfully excited
just be riding a horse.

09:01.715 --> 09:03.414
I'm guessing
there's a boy involved.

09:03.416 --> 09:06.086
Heh.
That would explain the pie.

10:50.891 --> 10:52.591
It means
you don't show your teeth.

10:52.593 --> 10:55.327
Just look natural.

10:56.597 --> 10:59.396
Maybe it's natural for me
to smile.

11:02.335 --> 11:04.202

was Daddy's age.

12:05.765 --> 12:07.899
He doesn't live here.
He works here.

12:07.901 --> 12:09.634

12:18.778 --> 12:20.245
We don't know if he wants
to see it.

12:20.247 --> 12:21.746
It might be showing off.

12:21.748 --> 12:24.816
But he's excited to meet us,
right?

12:24.818 --> 12:27.452
Ada?

12:27.454 --> 12:28.787
I didn't talk to him.

12:28.789 --> 12:30.855
I just asked on the phone
if Mr. Monroe was here

12:30.857 --> 12:33.524
- on Saturday.
- So we're a surprise?

12:33.526 --> 12:35.659
Our daddy saved his life.

12:35.661 --> 12:37.831
At least according
to the Internet.

12:41.969 --> 12:44.436
We're backed up. You girls
go ahead and have a seat.

12:44.438 --> 12:46.538
I'll call you
when we're ready for you.

12:46.540 --> 12:48.342
Why don't we just go
sit here?

13:03.857 --> 13:05.856
Smells homemade.

13:05.858 --> 13:06.991
It is.

13:06.993 --> 13:08.525
Who's the pie for?

13:08.527 --> 13:10.327
One of the fellas
that works here.

13:10.329 --> 13:11.799
Lucky him.

13:15.300 --> 13:17.635
I'm a Korean War vet.

13:17.637 --> 13:21.039
We don't get many visitors
with snacks.

13:21.041 --> 13:23.640
You two June bugs got names?

13:23.642 --> 13:25.909
I'm Ada Spencer
and she's Piper.

13:25.911 --> 13:27.912
I'm C.J. Simms.

13:27.914 --> 13:29.480
Pleased to meet you, sir.

13:29.482 --> 13:33.150
Macular degeneration
landed me in this place.

13:33.152 --> 13:36.721
I got all my marbles upstairs,
but I can't see worth a shoot.

13:38.925 --> 13:40.659
What's something to know
about you two

13:40.661 --> 13:43.495
besides you got access
to a working oven?

13:43.497 --> 13:45.896
Uh...

13:45.898 --> 13:47.899
We sing.

13:47.901 --> 13:49.900
But do you write songs?

13:49.902 --> 13:51.535
We're trying to.

13:51.537 --> 13:52.669
Me too.

13:52.671 --> 13:54.240
We're ready for you girls.

13:55.709 --> 13:57.911
It was real nice
to meet you, sir.

14:03.050 --> 14:04.281
Good morning, sir.

14:04.283 --> 14:06.351
We're Piper and Ada Spencer.

14:06.353 --> 14:08.852
We're military dependents.

14:08.854 --> 14:10.388
You here
to see your grandparents?

14:10.390 --> 14:14.094
No, sir. We're here to see
Mr. Henry LaRue Monroe.

14:17.363 --> 14:18.795
Why you wanna see him?

14:18.797 --> 14:20.731
Mr. Monroe fought
with our daddy,

14:20.733 --> 14:22.399
Staff Sergeant
Brian Spencer.

14:22.401 --> 14:24.635
He was there
when his life ended.

14:24.637 --> 14:27.871
Yeah, well,
Mr. Monroe is busy.

14:27.873 --> 14:30.476
So he's not seeing anyone.

14:32.112 --> 14:34.111
We could come back.

14:34.113 --> 14:35.413
Well,
that's not a good idea.

14:35.415 --> 14:37.215
We don't know
much about our daddy

14:37.217 --> 14:38.616
because we were little
when he...

14:42.388 --> 14:46.890
Anyway, we just wanted
to bring this pie.

14:46.892 --> 14:50.827
Ah, it can go in the dining hall
for the residents.

14:50.829 --> 14:52.597
Mr. Monroe,

14:52.599 --> 14:54.801
we came all this way.

14:57.903 --> 15:00.406
Nobody asked you to do that.

15:08.515 --> 15:13.016
Wait. Come along now, girls.

15:13.018 --> 15:14.351
Okay, that was rough.

15:14.353 --> 15:16.087
Uh, now, wait, wait.

15:16.089 --> 15:17.688
I guess you caught the man
off-guard.

15:17.690 --> 15:18.990
He didn't know what to do.

15:18.992 --> 15:21.193
Our daddy won a silver medal
saving his life.

15:21.195 --> 15:23.294
He didn't have one whisker
of thanks for that.

15:23.296 --> 15:24.928
Let's go. Here. You take it.

15:24.930 --> 15:27.265
It's chocolate chip pecan.
It's best with ice cream.

15:27.267 --> 15:29.534
I can't carry it.
I'm a fall risk.

15:29.536 --> 15:31.338
Bring it to my room?

15:34.773 --> 15:36.875
Just put the pie anywhere.

15:36.877 --> 15:38.509
Home sweet home.

15:38.511 --> 15:40.211
I got everything in here.

15:40.213 --> 15:42.446
Saxophone, guitar, piano.

15:42.448 --> 15:43.981
Ada, do you play piano

15:43.983 --> 15:46.617
or have you been
concentrating on the guitar?

15:46.619 --> 15:48.287
Uh, no.

15:51.657 --> 15:54.326
She plays piano.

15:54.328 --> 15:56.797
We've gotta go. Sorry.
It was nice to meet you.

15:57.897 --> 16:00.832
Piper, let's go.

16:00.834 --> 16:04.302
One... One... Now, hold on.

16:04.304 --> 16:05.535
I'll work on Monroe.

16:05.537 --> 16:07.706
Come back in a few days
and I'll have info.

16:07.708 --> 16:09.673
And the pie's
much appreciated,

16:09.675 --> 16:12.043
but, uh, for next time,

16:12.045 --> 16:14.578
my favorite pie
is strawberry-rhubarb.

16:14.580 --> 16:16.847
- Okay.
- Bye, sir.

16:16.849 --> 16:19.016
Bye, girls.

16:19.018 --> 16:21.318
<i>Dr. Murray, telephone call.</i>

16:38.171 --> 16:41.105
Piper, how'd you do
with that paint horse?

16:41.107 --> 16:42.673
He bit.

16:42.675 --> 16:44.445
Well,
I hope you pinched him back.

16:45.878 --> 16:48.446
I was too surprised
when it happened.

16:48.448 --> 16:50.948
Oh, honey, they bite
you gotta pinch them right back.

16:50.950 --> 16:52.549
Otherwise
a horse never learns.

16:52.551 --> 16:54.050
- You know, Meemaw's right.
- Mm-hm.

16:54.052 --> 16:56.287
You should try that
next time.

16:56.289 --> 16:58.255
Not sure
there'll be a next time.

16:58.257 --> 17:02.025
Oh, I'm sure Justine'll
let her ride that horse again.

17:02.027 --> 17:04.396
What's the horse's name?

17:04.397 --> 17:06.599
Monroe.

17:14.540 --> 17:16.209
Mama, tell us something
about Daddy.

17:19.478 --> 17:20.778
He was a wonderful man.

17:20.780 --> 17:22.412
Mama.

17:22.414 --> 17:25.148
And he loved
you girls so much.

17:25.151 --> 17:26.719
Mama, tell us something new.

17:30.757 --> 17:34.391
He liked model trains.

17:34.393 --> 17:36.462
And saltwater taffy.

17:38.430 --> 17:42.566
Everybody likes
saltwater taffy.

17:42.568 --> 17:44.169
I'm not a fan.

17:44.171 --> 17:46.771
Pulls the fillings
right out of my teeth.

17:46.773 --> 17:49.907
Well, it's awful hard
to miss somebody

17:49.909 --> 17:52.312
you didn't really get
to ever know.

18:00.319 --> 18:03.287
I can't keep shooting the same
weathered barn over and over

18:03.289 --> 18:05.156
and expect to build
any type of portfolio.

18:05.158 --> 18:08.159
All those old faces
at that place tell a story.

18:08.161 --> 18:11.361
You got plenty of things
to point your camera at.

18:11.363 --> 18:13.333
I'm not going back.

18:15.669 --> 18:18.503
I'm trying to get
a scholarship, Ada.

18:18.505 --> 18:20.036
Wherever college
you end up at

18:20.038 --> 18:21.773
will be lucky to get you.

18:21.775 --> 18:23.276
Thanks.

18:25.144 --> 18:28.612
You know, maybe Piper will
go back with me on Saturday.

18:28.614 --> 18:30.281
You are not taking
my little sister

18:30.283 --> 18:32.786
to a veteran home
without me.

into glad pants.

18:59.812 --> 19:00.812
Stop bickering.

19:00.814 --> 19:02.813
We didn't need to bring
a pie.

19:02.815 --> 19:06.320
Did too.
Mama thinks I'm riding a horse.

19:08.421 --> 19:11.155
We're just dropping
this pie to Mr. C.J. Simms

19:11.157 --> 19:14.158
and getting Justine
some photo opportunities.

19:14.160 --> 19:15.728

19:21.834 --> 19:23.767

We know where his room's at.

19:23.769 --> 19:25.269
He ain't there.

19:25.271 --> 19:27.506
Did something happen to him?

19:29.209 --> 19:31.508

Hey, Mr. Simms.

21:37.703 --> 21:39.536
You're back.

21:39.538 --> 21:42.040
The pie's strawberry-rhubarb.
Just like you said.

21:42.042 --> 21:45.642
There is nothing better
than a woman who can hear.

21:45.644 --> 21:48.478
- Heard that.
- Our Meemaw made it.

21:48.480 --> 21:50.648
Bless her precious heart.

21:50.650 --> 21:52.315
She bakes
to control her OCD.

21:52.317 --> 21:55.719
Fingers crossed
she's never cured.

21:55.721 --> 21:57.521
I got some news, June bugs.

21:57.523 --> 22:03.694
I have cracked the nut
that is Mr. Henry LaRue Monroe.

22:03.696 --> 22:05.262
Yeah? What did he say?

22:05.264 --> 22:08.198
Well, he offered up

22:08.200 --> 22:11.869
that Brian Spencer
was a good Marine.

22:11.871 --> 22:13.871
And that your father
could sing.

22:13.873 --> 22:15.872
Yeah, we've been told.

22:15.874 --> 22:19.110
So you know that
before he met your mom

22:19.112 --> 22:21.411
he was chasing
the songwriter dream?

22:21.413 --> 22:22.513
How was that?

22:22.515 --> 22:24.881
In Nashville. He worked the
clubs.

22:24.883 --> 22:28.584
Put together a little career
from what I hear.

22:28.586 --> 22:31.255
You're sure he was talking
about the right Brian Spencer?

22:31.257 --> 22:34.225
The Marine
who saved Monroe's life.

22:34.227 --> 22:36.593
- Swear you're not making this up?
- Ha, ha.

22:36.595 --> 22:40.898
There's a fella
at the Mockingbird Lounge.

22:40.900 --> 22:42.600
Shirtsleeves McCoy.

22:42.602 --> 22:45.069
He's an old friend of mine.

22:45.071 --> 22:46.769
If your daddy worked much
in Nashville,

22:46.771 --> 22:49.907
Shirtsleeves
will remember him.

22:49.909 --> 22:51.909
You should ask him.

22:51.911 --> 22:54.210
You girls should go.

22:54.212 --> 22:55.545
To Nashville?

22:55.547 --> 22:57.381
Without telling Mama
or Meemaw?

22:57.383 --> 22:58.916
We're already halfway there.

22:58.918 --> 23:00.884
We don't have permission.

23:00.886 --> 23:04.721
Piper, if you're ever
gonna get anywhere in life,

met Uncle Dell here at Tootsies.

24:11.557 --> 24:13.556
- Picture. Picture. Come on.
- Oh, okay.

24:18.863 --> 24:20.797
Stay in the truck.
I'll go check it out.

24:20.799 --> 24:22.865
I am not letting you go
in a bar by yourself.

24:22.867 --> 24:25.136
It's a music place,
not a bar.

24:25.138 --> 24:27.670
All right, well,
then I'm going with you.

24:27.672 --> 24:31.175
I'm not standing out here alone
like someone's farting dog.

24:31.177 --> 24:33.647
Good visual, Piper.

24:35.180 --> 24:37.881
- Oh, boy.
- Are they closed?

24:37.883 --> 24:40.484
They answered the phone.

24:40.486 --> 24:42.652
Sorry, sorry, sorry I'm late.
I'm here.

24:42.654 --> 24:44.421
Excuse me.

24:44.423 --> 24:45.922
Do you work here?

24:45.924 --> 24:47.225
Ye... Yes, ma'am.

24:47.227 --> 24:50.194
I... I... I work here.
How can I help you?

24:50.196 --> 24:53.063
We're looking for a fella
named Shirtsleeves McCoy.

24:53.065 --> 24:55.865
Probably in his office,
but we don't open up till 7.

24:55.867 --> 24:57.735
We drove hours to get here

24:57.737 --> 24:59.836
and we're just hoping
to ask him a few questions.

24:59.838 --> 25:01.170
Where y'all from?

25:01.172 --> 25:03.341
- Parnell.
- Cool.

25:03.343 --> 25:04.574
Uh, yeah, I can...

25:04.576 --> 25:06.509
I can let someone know
you're here. This way.

25:06.511 --> 25:08.411
Thanks.

25:08.413 --> 25:10.547
Are you a musician?

25:10.549 --> 25:12.381
Uh, yes, ma'am,
I like to think so.

25:12.383 --> 25:14.851
My sister plays guitar.
And she sings.

25:14.853 --> 25:16.553
I do too.

25:16.555 --> 25:18.855
We're not trying to audition
or nothing.

25:18.857 --> 25:20.725
We're here
about family stuff.

25:20.727 --> 25:23.393
- I'm Ada Spencer.
- And I'm Piper.

25:23.395 --> 25:25.396
I'm Declan.

25:25.398 --> 25:27.130
I'm just the person
documenting it all.

25:27.132 --> 25:28.631
You got a name?

25:28.633 --> 25:29.899
Yep.

25:31.571 --> 25:33.773
It's Declan.

25:38.776 --> 25:39.877
Fellas, how we doing?

25:39.879 --> 25:41.044
- Howdy.
- Opening act.

25:41.046 --> 25:42.646
- Always here early.
- What's up?

25:42.648 --> 25:43.647
This way.

25:43.649 --> 25:46.217
- Mr. McCoy.
- You're late.

25:46.219 --> 25:47.951
I just found these three girls
out front.

25:47.953 --> 25:50.621
- Wanted to talk to you about...
- I got a security camera, Declan.

25:50.623 --> 25:51.822
I can see when you're late.

25:51.824 --> 25:53.890
I just thought... These girls
wanna ask you...

25:53.892 --> 25:55.892
Ed has to rewire
the main stage.

25:55.894 --> 25:57.160
You get out there.

25:57.162 --> 25:58.963
I'll take care of the girls.

25:58.965 --> 26:01.666
- Good luck.
- Thanks for getting us this far.

26:01.668 --> 26:03.566
If you're late again,
don't come back.

26:03.568 --> 26:05.805
He's showing off for you.

26:08.574 --> 26:10.908
We're not taking
any applications right now.

26:10.910 --> 26:13.311
Plus, you gotta be 21
to even be in the building.

26:13.313 --> 26:15.813
We're not looking for jobs,
sir.

26:15.815 --> 26:17.848
We got a friend named C.J. Simms
who told us

26:17.850 --> 26:19.316
to come here
and talk to you.

26:19.318 --> 26:20.583
C.J.?

26:20.585 --> 26:24.588
So why does he want you
to come and see me?

26:24.590 --> 26:28.926
Well, Brian Spencer
was our daddy.

26:28.928 --> 26:31.861
We were wondering if you ever
heard anything about him?

26:31.863 --> 26:33.964
Brian who went
into the Marines?

26:33.966 --> 26:35.699
Yes, sir.

26:35.701 --> 26:39.803
I heard what happened.
He was a great man.

26:39.805 --> 26:42.272
We're just looking
to find out more about him,

26:42.274 --> 26:44.444
hoping to talk to someone
who knew about his music.

26:47.313 --> 26:48.879
Let me tell you something.

26:48.881 --> 26:53.883
Your daddy used to clean up
after shows.

26:53.885 --> 26:56.320
And that's common
to get a foot in the door.

26:56.322 --> 26:58.655
He moved up to bartending

26:58.657 --> 27:01.559
and then he walked
the longest 60 feet of his life

27:01.561 --> 27:03.226
when he stepped up
on that stage.

27:03.228 --> 27:05.063
Our daddy sang here?

27:05.065 --> 27:08.067
He did.
You didn't know about his music?

27:09.201 --> 27:10.499
No, sir.

27:10.501 --> 27:13.137
Plus, our mama don't like
to talk about him much.

27:13.139 --> 27:16.740
Your daddy played guitar
and he wrote songs.

27:16.742 --> 27:18.542
Good ones.

27:18.544 --> 27:21.245
He was singing
with Marq Dunn back then.

27:21.247 --> 27:23.412
Marq Dunn?

27:23.414 --> 27:24.916
That's a man, right?

27:24.918 --> 27:26.316
That's a woman.

27:26.318 --> 27:29.085
Wait, the Marq Dunn?

27:29.087 --> 27:31.688
The one and only.

27:31.690 --> 27:35.226
You know, I think I might
have something for y'all.

27:35.228 --> 27:36.563
Give me a sec.

27:38.197 --> 27:40.397
This is messy.
Want some of these put away

27:40.399 --> 27:42.235
you gotta do it yourself.

27:47.405 --> 27:48.738
- Oh, my gosh.
- Whoa.

27:48.740 --> 27:50.674
It's right there in print.

27:50.676 --> 27:53.343
- I wish I had more time, girls.
- Thank you so much.

27:53.345 --> 27:55.246
- Thank you, sir.
- We really appreciate this.

27:55.248 --> 27:56.749
- It's okay. Good luck to y'all.
- A lot.

27:58.183 --> 27:59.883
That Brian was our daddy.

27:59.885 --> 28:01.752
He performed with Marq Dunn.

28:01.754 --> 28:04.721
Marq Dunn? Damn.

28:04.723 --> 28:07.056
What is it you do here?

28:07.058 --> 28:09.360
I work with the sound guys.

28:09.362 --> 28:11.896
But one day
you'll be on that stage.

28:11.898 --> 28:13.196
Maybe.

28:13.198 --> 28:15.064
What'd you say
your last name was?

28:15.066 --> 28:16.233
Spencer.

28:16.235 --> 28:17.400
Spencer.

28:17.402 --> 28:19.035
Mine's Martino.

28:19.037 --> 28:22.406
I'll be sure to look out
for the Spencer sisters.

28:22.408 --> 28:24.978
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

28:26.379 --> 28:28.079
Okay. Bye.

28:28.081 --> 28:31.482
Heh. Bye.

28:31.484 --> 28:34.083
We are moving to Nashville
the day we graduate high school.

28:34.085 --> 28:35.886
- Nashville?
- You are not leaving me alone

28:35.888 --> 28:37.121
to rot at Meemaw's.

28:37.123 --> 28:40.091
I'm going to art school
in New York. Then Paris.

28:40.093 --> 28:42.226
Can you all believe
what just happened in there?

28:42.228 --> 28:43.761
- Marq Dunn.
- Marq Dunn, man.

28:43.763 --> 28:45.629
- Heh.
- This is all a secret.

28:45.631 --> 28:47.563
- Oh, I'm zipped up.
- One peep and you're back

28:47.565 --> 28:49.131
to playing
with Meemaw's chickens.

29:10.823 --> 29:12.156
It's been two days.

29:12.158 --> 29:14.190
No one's returned my e-mail.

29:14.192 --> 29:16.192
Yeah, Marq Dunn doesn't check
her own website.

29:16.194 --> 29:17.661
It's probably run
by assistants.

29:17.663 --> 29:19.766
- That's so unfair.
- Not really.

29:21.333 --> 29:23.266
We need to go
to a Marq Dunn show.

29:23.268 --> 29:26.469
She just finished a big tour.
She's got nothing scheduled.

29:26.471 --> 29:28.839
Well, then we need
to get her telephone number.

29:28.841 --> 29:30.607
Or her home address.

29:30.609 --> 29:32.942
Maybe Declan can help us.

29:32.944 --> 29:35.278
I found his band online.

29:35.280 --> 29:37.346
He's playing in Nashville
this weekend.

29:37.348 --> 29:39.851
Are you interested
in meeting Marq Dunn

29:39.853 --> 29:41.784
or do you just wanna talk
to Declan?

29:41.786 --> 29:43.719
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

29:43.721 --> 29:46.390
I'm part of whatever
you two are cooking up.

29:46.392 --> 29:47.858
It's a good thing you can sing

29:47.860 --> 29:50.229
because so much else about you
is irritating.

29:52.297 --> 29:54.163
We're going back to Nashville
on Saturday.

29:54.165 --> 29:56.534
I knew it.

29:56.536 --> 30:00.871
We're thinking that fella Declan
could help us find Miss Dunn.

30:00.873 --> 30:03.640
Oh, well,
that's an interesting theory.

30:03.642 --> 30:05.876
- Why?
- You know why.

30:05.878 --> 30:07.878
- What?
- Ada and Declan

30:07.880 --> 30:09.880
- Go back inside.
- sitting in a tree.

30:09.882 --> 30:11.849
- Go back inside.
- K-I-S-S-I-N-G.

30:17.189 --> 30:18.322
What are you doing?

30:18.324 --> 30:19.390
What?

30:19.392 --> 30:21.594
I have something in my eye.

30:23.895 --> 30:25.597
What?

30:28.366 --> 30:30.399
I just wanna look nice.

We are Kitchen Backsplash!

32:07.865 --> 32:09.300
Thank you.

32:09.302 --> 32:12.436
- That was amazing.
- Yeah.

32:12.438 --> 32:15.675
Now you got even more reason
to stare at your phone all day.

32:17.375 --> 32:19.642
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:19.644 --> 32:21.210
Let's let your sister
have her shot.

32:21.212 --> 32:22.681
Hey, Kitchen Backsplash.

32:25.183 --> 32:28.185
I did not expect
to see you here today.

32:28.187 --> 32:30.854
Um... What did you think?

32:30.856 --> 32:32.790
- What I think?
- Yeah.

32:32.792 --> 32:35.359
I think
you're my new favorite band.

32:35.361 --> 32:36.560
Really?

32:36.562 --> 32:37.960
As of today, yeah.

32:37.962 --> 32:39.629
Thank you for coming,
I appreciate it.

32:39.631 --> 32:41.297
- Yeah, of course.
- It's good to see you.

32:41.299 --> 32:42.299
Good to see you too.

32:42.301 --> 32:44.668
Uh-oh.
An enemy combatant approaching.

32:44.670 --> 32:46.203
Hey.

32:46.205 --> 32:47.736
- Hi.
- Hey, hey.

32:47.738 --> 32:48.905
Hey. Good to see you.

32:48.907 --> 32:50.174
Anne, MaryBeth, Ada.

32:50.176 --> 32:51.541
Should we go say hello to...?

32:51.543 --> 32:54.343
Nah. Your sister's holding
her ground.

32:54.345 --> 32:56.714
Um, yeah.

32:56.716 --> 32:58.148
Perfect. Great.

32:58.150 --> 33:00.850
- Good to see you guys.
- Yeah, you too.

33:00.852 --> 33:02.752
Bye.

33:02.754 --> 33:04.188
Hey, um...

33:04.190 --> 33:06.857
I was wondering
if I could get your number.

33:06.859 --> 33:08.492
- Yeah, sure.
- Would you?

33:08.494 --> 33:11.328
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

33:11.330 --> 33:12.896
Bold.

33:12.898 --> 33:14.363
Bye.

33:18.069 --> 33:20.203
He took my number.

33:20.205 --> 33:23.840
And he said he'll look
into finding a way to Marq Dunn.

33:23.842 --> 33:25.874
What about his girlfriend?

33:25.876 --> 33:27.878
That was his aunt
and his cousins.

33:27.880 --> 33:30.683
He and his girlfriend
broke up last month.

33:31.883 --> 33:33.583
You got all that just then?

33:33.585 --> 33:36.255
No. I saw the girlfriend thing
on Facebook.

33:39.392 --> 33:41.690
Why didn't I get his number?

33:41.692 --> 33:44.026
Mm. Tactical mistake.

33:44.028 --> 33:45.728
I was trying to be ladylike.

33:45.730 --> 33:48.698
Don't stress.

33:48.700 --> 33:50.536
He looked interested.

33:52.371 --> 33:54.804
- You think?
- Let's just work on the song.

33:54.806 --> 33:57.373
Hey, what are you two
doing out here?

33:57.375 --> 33:58.475
Talking.

33:58.477 --> 34:00.780
Well, get to bed.
You look exhausted.

34:02.448 --> 34:04.150
What happened today?

34:06.384 --> 34:07.817
She's tired.

34:07.819 --> 34:09.152
Oh.

34:09.154 --> 34:10.386
From the paint horse?

34:10.388 --> 34:12.755
- Yes, ma'am.
- Did he bite you again?

34:12.757 --> 34:13.989
No, ma'am.

34:13.991 --> 34:16.293
Good. Now, get to bed.
Both of you.

34:20.899 --> 34:23.567
Okay, forget about that guy,
let's work.

34:23.569 --> 34:24.768
You're right.

34:27.739 --> 34:28.772
Hello?

34:28.774 --> 34:30.507
<i>Hey there.</i>

34:30.509 --> 34:31.775
Declan?

34:31.777 --> 34:33.409
<i>How you doing, Ada?</i>

34:33.411 --> 34:35.745
Um, I'm good. How are you?

34:35.746 --> 34:37.915
<i>I'm good. Hey, I was...</i>

34:37.917 --> 34:39.014
I was gonna send you a text,

34:39.016 --> 34:40.683
but I thought
calling would be better.

34:40.685 --> 34:42.819
I didn't realize how loud
it was gonna be in here.

34:42.821 --> 34:45.422
Calling's cool.
It's easier sometimes.

34:45.424 --> 34:47.591
<i>Right.
Um, hey, I wanted to thank you</i>

34:47.592 --> 34:49.259
<i>for coming to see us play
today.</i>

34:49.261 --> 34:51.094
You guys are amazing.

34:51.096 --> 34:52.295
I appreciate it.

34:52.297 --> 34:55.466
Um, hey, you know,
next time we're together

34:55.467 --> 34:58.634
you have to sing for me, huh?
How's that sound?

34:58.636 --> 35:00.170
I'd like that. Yeah. Yeah.

35:00.172 --> 35:01.270
<i>Great. Bring your guitar.</i>

35:01.272 --> 35:03.041
All right. Yeah.

35:06.645 --> 35:07.844
Who's the new fella?

35:07.846 --> 35:10.848
Mom, it's like being
in a fishbowl in this house.

35:10.850 --> 35:12.850
Hey, I'm happy
if you're seeing someone.

35:12.852 --> 35:14.951
You know, that Cuthbert boy
only joined the choir

35:14.953 --> 35:16.522
because of you.

35:25.230 --> 35:27.797
So Mama thinks
you have a boyfriend.

35:27.799 --> 35:29.701
Well, I don't.

35:32.536 --> 35:35.638
Maybe we should tell her
we been going to Nashville.

35:35.640 --> 35:37.007
You better stay zipped.

35:37.009 --> 35:39.308
We done nothing wrong and I'm
not gonna argue with you.

35:39.310 --> 35:40.478
All right.

35:42.515 --> 35:45.415
So you don't want Declan
as a boyfriend?

35:45.417 --> 35:47.817
I barely know him.

35:47.819 --> 35:51.487
And this is about Daddy.
And our music.

35:51.489 --> 35:53.390
Ada, really?

35:53.392 --> 35:55.491
Declan says he's knows people
who know people

35:55.493 --> 35:56.726
who know Marq Dunn.

35:56.728 --> 35:59.830
We probably know people
who know people

35:59.832 --> 36:01.498
who know people
who know Marq Dunn.

36:01.500 --> 36:03.567
Yeah, but there's an extra set
of people in there.

36:07.372 --> 36:09.105
- Who's that?
- Justine.

36:09.107 --> 36:11.841
No, it's not.

36:11.843 --> 36:14.377
Declan got us tickets.

36:14.379 --> 36:15.745

Yes. Actually, we were...

39:03.013 --> 39:06.251
Did you know Brian Spencer,
sir?

39:07.685 --> 39:08.951
I knew Brian.

39:08.953 --> 39:12.388
Brian was our daddy.

39:12.390 --> 39:15.058
We heard Miss Marq and him
were good friends.

39:15.060 --> 39:16.929
We were hoping to meet her.

39:30.274 --> 39:32.377
Come on.

39:35.446 --> 39:37.714
You gotta be
kidding me with this now.

39:37.716 --> 39:39.618
All right.

39:47.792 --> 39:49.225
Hi.

39:49.227 --> 39:50.759
Hi.

39:50.761 --> 39:51.795
Hi.

39:51.797 --> 39:53.596
Uh...

39:53.598 --> 39:58.234
Brian was, uh,
an amazing person and a...

39:58.236 --> 40:00.437
A good friend.

40:00.439 --> 40:03.005

when he went overseas.

I can see your daddy
in you two.

40:05.810 --> 40:07.176
You haven't even heard us
sing.

40:07.178 --> 40:08.511
Oh, you're little songbirds?

40:08.513 --> 40:10.147
Yes, ma'am.

40:10.149 --> 40:13.016
Our daddy's favorite singer
was Willie Nelson.

40:13.018 --> 40:14.850
That's mine too.

40:14.852 --> 40:17.422
- Do you know him, ma'am?
- I do.

40:19.357 --> 40:20.826
Wow.

40:22.527 --> 40:24.997
Why don't you ever come out
to Parnell and visit with Mama?

40:26.330 --> 40:27.964
That's a long story.

40:27.966 --> 40:29.433
Is there a short version?

40:29.435 --> 40:31.969
Hey. How about you two girls
sing us a song?

40:31.971 --> 40:33.469
Right here?

40:33.471 --> 40:35.105
Ted, you're putting them
on the spot.

40:35.107 --> 40:36.373
It's all right, ma'am.

40:36.375 --> 40:40.643

to my sister's guitar.

41:26.524 --> 41:28.491
about coming to my house
sometime

41:28.493 --> 41:29.826
and visiting with me?

41:29.828 --> 41:30.893
Would you like that?

41:36.167 --> 41:37.533
We'd like that, Miss Marq.

41:37.535 --> 41:38.667
Nope, just Marq.

41:38.669 --> 41:40.170
So, Marq,
when can we come over?

41:40.172 --> 41:41.337
Piper.

41:41.339 --> 41:44.408
Uh, how about next weekend?

41:44.410 --> 41:45.674
Okay.

41:45.676 --> 41:47.044
I'll, uh... I'll have Ted

41:47.046 --> 41:49.279
give you my address
and everything.

41:49.281 --> 41:50.679
Great.
We'll see you then.

41:52.450 --> 41:53.618

42:08.767 --> 42:10.768

42:12.370 --> 42:15.370

I'd meet Brian's kids.

42:15.372 --> 42:17.940

Not a surprise.

42:17.942 --> 42:19.777

you're gonna listen, though,

45:50.788 --> 45:52.855
She's real busy at the café.

45:52.857 --> 45:55.292
So we didn't tell her.

45:55.294 --> 45:58.159
I guess you and Mama
aren't really friends?

45:58.161 --> 46:00.830

46:00.832 --> 46:02.031
We will.

46:02.033 --> 46:04.433
It's just the timing
wasn't good.

46:04.435 --> 46:06.201
So you live here all alone,
Miss Marq?

46:06.203 --> 46:09.138
No, I share the place

46:09.140 --> 46:10.373

46:10.375 --> 46:12.044

46:17.482 --> 46:19.147
- They're big.
- I could almost ride

46:19.149 --> 46:20.382
- one of those guys.
- Hey.

46:20.384 --> 46:22.650
- Ha-ha-ha. they're real friendly.
- Oh, so cute.

to end squirrels on Earth.

46:25.489 --> 46:26.823
Are you hungry or...?

46:26.825 --> 46:29.558
- Or, uh, thirsty or anything?
- No, ma'am. No.

46:29.560 --> 46:31.527
- No. Not me.
- Should've told you

46:31.529 --> 46:33.495
to bring your swimsuits.
I keep the pool warm.

46:33.497 --> 46:35.163
Oh, shoot.
We can swim any ole time.

46:35.165 --> 46:37.699
Can't talk to you
any ole time.

46:37.701 --> 46:40.835
You sounded like your daddy
just then.

46:40.837 --> 46:43.339
Thanks, ma'am.

46:43.341 --> 46:47.676
Miss Marq,
how did you meet our daddy?

46:47.678 --> 46:51.147
We were, uh... We were
both getting our cars fixed.

46:51.149 --> 46:54.850
And the mechanic's wife
went into labor,

46:54.852 --> 46:56.419
and he just took off.

46:56.421 --> 46:58.888
So the two of us
were just sitting there

46:58.890 --> 47:01.690
and I started
to hum this tune

47:01.692 --> 47:05.395
and then your daddy
joined in and...

47:05.397 --> 47:08.330
And then we ended up, uh,
writing a song

47:08.332 --> 47:12.268
called, um,
"Waiting for Answers."

47:12.270 --> 47:14.203
- Was it any good?
- It wasn't half bad.

47:14.205 --> 47:16.339
People thought
it was about waiting for love.

47:16.341 --> 47:18.775
But it was about waiting
for a fan belt.

47:21.511 --> 47:22.877
And then after that?

47:22.879 --> 47:28.217
We got to be friends
and, um...

47:28.219 --> 47:31.219
we wrote all kinds of songs
that summer.

47:31.221 --> 47:33.589
And, uh, started performing.

47:33.591 --> 47:35.190
And you knew our mama?

47:35.192 --> 47:36.426
Yes. I met her.

47:36.428 --> 47:40.562
We didn't really spend
a lot of time together.

47:40.564 --> 47:43.232
Brian fell hard for her,
fast.

47:43.234 --> 47:45.900
Things moved very quickly
for your mom and dad.

47:45.902 --> 47:47.971
But she never liked
his music?

47:47.973 --> 47:50.239
No, no, no,
she loved his music.

47:50.241 --> 47:54.277
I'd say
she was his biggest fan.

47:54.279 --> 47:56.411
She's not now.

47:56.413 --> 47:58.379
We didn't even know
he ever played clubs

47:58.381 --> 47:59.483
or nothing like that.

48:01.785 --> 48:04.152
You know,
I can't speak for her, but it...

48:04.154 --> 48:06.057
It might just be too hard.

48:08.093 --> 48:10.092
Music, it touches your soul.

48:10.094 --> 48:12.261
Yeah.

48:12.263 --> 48:14.929
Without music,
life would be a mistake.

48:14.931 --> 48:16.799
Love that.

48:16.801 --> 48:18.667
Nietzsche said it.
I'm just repeating.

48:18.669 --> 48:19.803
Book smart.

48:19.805 --> 48:22.437
I know it looking at her.
It's the haircut.

48:22.439 --> 48:25.574
Well, Justine's not just
interested in photography.

48:25.576 --> 48:27.844
I also love horses.
And books.

48:27.846 --> 48:28.978
Books and horses,

48:28.980 --> 48:30.179
- in that order.
- Heh.

48:30.181 --> 48:31.614
Yeah.

48:34.417 --> 48:36.585
Let's go inside. I...

48:36.587 --> 48:40.690
I have something that I...
I want you guys to listen to.

48:40.692 --> 48:42.027
Come on.

48:49.801 --> 48:51.167
<i>It's time.</i>

48:52.370 --> 48:54.804
<i>I think you got it.</i>

48:54.806 --> 48:56.437
<i>Um, we'll give it a shot.</i>

48:56.439 --> 48:57.839
<i>Just keep it simple.</i>

48:57.841 --> 48:59.509
<i>Why don't I do
the harmony on...?</i>

48:59.511 --> 49:00.710
<i>On this...? On this one?</i>

49:00.712 --> 49:01.877
<i>All right.</i>

49:01.879 --> 49:03.812
- That's Daddy, Piper.
- <i>You ready?</i>

49:03.814 --> 49:05.815
<i>I was born ready, girl.</i>

49:05.817 --> 49:07.650

49:57.201 --> 50:00.604
Your daddy wrote that
when he met your mama.

50:02.038 --> 50:03.538
He did?

50:03.540 --> 50:08.944
I contributed a little bit,
but it's mostly his.

50:08.946 --> 50:11.346
Our daddy wrote a song
for our mama.

50:11.348 --> 50:13.882
Oh, he wrote lots.

50:13.884 --> 50:15.216
He was amazing with words.

50:15.218 --> 50:17.121
Loved poetry.

50:18.622 --> 50:21.525
I never pictured him
as a poem-y kind of guy.

50:24.060 --> 50:25.463
He was.

50:27.265 --> 50:29.565
Miss Marq,

50:29.567 --> 50:32.270
we need to learn
how to play that song.

50:40.911 --> 50:43.745

- So you go ahead and...
- All right.

50:45.582 --> 50:47.083

51:05.669 --> 51:07.603
...is not gonna believe
we met Marq Dunn.

51:07.605 --> 51:08.636
I bet we'll see her

51:08.638 --> 51:09.904
- all the time.
- All the time.

51:09.906 --> 51:10.940
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Yes, I...

51:10.942 --> 51:13.509
Mr. Monroe.

51:13.511 --> 51:15.279
Mr. Monroe?

51:18.283 --> 51:19.915
We're here to see C.J.

51:19.917 --> 51:21.783
He's probably napping.

51:21.785 --> 51:25.654
But also we came here today
to say thank you.

51:25.656 --> 51:27.522
This is for you.

51:27.524 --> 51:30.759
It's saltwater taffy.

51:30.761 --> 51:33.261
<i>Phone call for Mr. Deacons.</i>

51:33.263 --> 51:36.931
<i>Samuel Deacons,
you have a phone call.</i>

51:54.518 --> 51:56.453
We shouldn't be eating this.

52:01.859 --> 52:03.859
So that's why
the numbering system

52:03.861 --> 52:07.328
is so good for transposing
from one key to another.

52:07.330 --> 52:09.565
And the second part
of the numbering system,

52:09.567 --> 52:12.400
it tells you how many beats
in each chord.

52:12.402 --> 52:16.170
So that's one chord,
for two measures.

52:16.172 --> 52:18.674
So in this case, one is G.

52:18.676 --> 52:22.380
<i>♪ One two, one two, one two ♪</i>

52:28.886 --> 52:30.419
You girls got plans later?

52:30.421 --> 52:33.156
I told my friend Declan
we'd see him

52:33.158 --> 52:34.522
because we're in town.

52:34.524 --> 52:36.158
Maybe you wanna meet me
in a few hours

52:36.160 --> 52:37.393
and bring your friend?

52:37.395 --> 52:38.828
Back here?

52:38.830 --> 52:40.897
No. I'm going out too.
I'll get you the address.

52:40.899 --> 52:41.996
Yeah.

52:48.605 --> 52:50.404
Are you sure
this is the right address?

52:50.406 --> 52:51.908
Let me check again.

52:51.910 --> 52:53.174
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Hi.

52:53.176 --> 52:54.542
- Hi.
- How y'all doing?

52:54.544 --> 52:56.112
Well, we're lost.

52:56.114 --> 52:57.879
This is the address
she gave us.

52:57.881 --> 52:59.915
Well, there's lots
of great music in church

52:59.917 --> 53:03.386
so maybe she wants you
to hear some?

53:03.388 --> 53:04.520
Okay.

53:04.522 --> 53:05.888
Okay.

53:05.890 --> 53:07.788
- How you doing?
- I'm good. How are you?

53:07.790 --> 53:10.558
Yeah. I was supposed
to be here earlier. I am sorry.

53:10.560 --> 53:12.895
- You found us!
- Ha! We did.

53:12.897 --> 53:15.297
So you didn't tell
them you were meeting them

53:15.299 --> 53:17.966
- at the studio?
- I wanted to surprise them.

53:17.968 --> 53:19.734
You done that. Heh.

53:19.736 --> 53:21.069
Hello, Nietzsche.

53:21.071 --> 53:23.071
Ma'am.

53:23.073 --> 53:24.105
It's Marq.

53:24.107 --> 53:26.375
- Right.
- Declan, glad you could join us.

53:26.377 --> 53:28.243
So nice to meet you, ma'am.
Thank you so much

53:28.245 --> 53:29.277
for this surprise.

53:29.279 --> 53:30.814
Girls,
I wanna show you something.

53:34.551 --> 53:36.652
Are we gonna hear
you record a song?

53:36.654 --> 53:40.556
No, we're gonna hear you
record a song.

53:40.558 --> 53:42.391
Are you serious?

53:42.393 --> 53:43.926
Time's already paid for.

53:43.928 --> 53:46.795
Come on,
let me take you downstairs.

53:46.797 --> 53:48.330
All right, let's take a pass

53:48.332 --> 53:50.433
and then we'll see
where the other parts come in.

53:50.435 --> 53:51.933
Are you gonna play with us?

53:51.935 --> 53:53.402
That's the plan.

53:53.404 --> 53:54.636
Let's give it a go.

53:54.638 --> 53:56.504
Just like we're singing
on the back porch.

53:56.506 --> 53:57.808

56:13.477 --> 56:15.310
Thank you.

56:15.312 --> 56:18.880
- Oh.
- Thanks.

56:18.882 --> 56:20.415
Now, do it again better.

56:20.417 --> 56:21.449
Okay.

56:21.451 --> 56:22.984
Thank you.

56:22.986 --> 56:24.953
I'll take another
when you get a chance.

56:26.991 --> 56:29.091
- Hey, Elizabeth.
- Well, hey, there, Shula.

56:29.093 --> 56:30.458
What can I get you?

56:30.460 --> 56:32.326
Oh, I would love
a slice of peach pie

56:32.328 --> 56:33.428
and a cup of coffee.

56:33.430 --> 56:35.096
Yeah,
Meemaw's pies are addictive.

56:35.098 --> 56:37.901
What did the girls
bring you over this morning?

56:57.687 --> 56:59.520
Now, we gotta tell Mama
and Meemaw.

56:59.522 --> 57:00.522
I know.

57:00.524 --> 57:01.823
Mama might be mad at first,

57:01.825 --> 57:05.029
but once she sees
all the stuff that's happened...

57:10.634 --> 57:12.868
Shula Sloan
was in the café today.

57:12.870 --> 57:14.536
- Mama...
- I knew something was up

57:14.538 --> 57:16.971
with you girls.
Gone all the time with Justine.

57:16.973 --> 57:18.640
We were gonna tell you.
Just...

57:18.642 --> 57:20.609
She said she didn't know
nothing about Piper

57:20.611 --> 57:22.844
riding the paint horse.

57:22.846 --> 57:24.045
Mama, let us explain.

57:24.047 --> 57:25.647
So I came straight right home

57:25.649 --> 57:28.317
and me and your Meemaw,
we found all this stuff.

57:28.319 --> 57:30.819
And that is when I realized
I had raised liars.

57:30.821 --> 57:32.888
- Mama, would you listen?
- There's nothing worse

57:32.890 --> 57:35.192
than a liar, Ada. Nothing.

57:36.893 --> 57:40.230
Tell me
where you were today.

57:47.839 --> 57:49.306
Nashville.

57:51.408 --> 57:54.676
Nashville?

57:54.678 --> 57:58.346
We wanted to know more
about Daddy.

57:58.348 --> 58:02.183
I found the Silver Star
when the pipe broke.

58:02.185 --> 58:04.252
It was with all
the flooded stuff.

58:04.254 --> 58:07.721
And then a Marine
at the veterans' home told us

58:07.723 --> 58:10.158
about Daddy's music.

58:10.160 --> 58:12.027
Mom, we're sorry.

58:12.029 --> 58:14.763
Please,
we won't see her again.

58:14.765 --> 58:16.901
See who?

58:23.107 --> 58:25.009
Marq Dunn.

58:28.779 --> 58:30.879
You saw Marq?

58:30.881 --> 58:33.350
We were at her house today.

58:35.085 --> 58:38.453
She took us
to a recording studio.

58:38.455 --> 58:41.623
Oh, girls.

58:41.625 --> 58:43.891
Marq told us from the start
to let you know.

58:43.893 --> 58:45.893
We were gonna do it today.

58:45.895 --> 58:48.897
Where does this boy Declan
fit in? Hmm?

58:48.899 --> 58:50.598
Oh, don't tell me
Marq's met him.

58:50.600 --> 58:51.935
He helped us find her.

58:53.904 --> 58:57.739
What other secrets you girls got
I don't know about? Hmm?

58:57.741 --> 59:00.442
Not telling you was wrong.

59:00.444 --> 59:04.413
And I am sorry for that.

59:04.415 --> 59:07.082
But we are not the only ones
in this house

59:07.084 --> 59:09.384
with secrets.

59:09.386 --> 59:13.554
Our daddy
shouldn't be a secret.

59:13.556 --> 59:17.259
We should know who he was
and we should be proud.

59:17.261 --> 59:18.826
Girls, your Mama...

59:18.828 --> 59:21.332
Don't tell us
we're lucky, Meemaw.

59:23.267 --> 59:25.002
I wasn't gonna say that.

59:26.837 --> 59:29.474
I'm sorry for hurting you.

59:31.174 --> 59:33.010
But I want to be a singer.

59:35.946 --> 59:37.481
And so does Piper.

59:40.017 --> 59:41.616
Oh, girls,
your mama is not saying

59:41.618 --> 59:42.783
she don't want you to sing.

59:42.785 --> 59:44.118
Yes, I am.

59:44.120 --> 59:45.453
I want her to go to college.

59:45.455 --> 59:48.323
I want them both
to get real careers.

59:48.325 --> 59:50.160
Who said music
can't be a real career?

Surprisingly no.

01:01:44.274 --> 01:01:46.310
Couldn't sleep anyway,
though.

01:01:51.649 --> 01:01:52.982
Help me
if I mess up the words.

01:01:52.984 --> 01:01:54.482
Mm-hm.

01:01:54.484 --> 01:01:57.786

01:01:57.788 --> 01:02:02.123

01:02:02.125 --> 01:02:03.460
♪ We don't quit... ♪

01:02:07.765 --> 01:02:11.299
I've heard this song before,
long time ago.

01:02:11.301 --> 01:02:12.503
Beautiful.

01:02:14.605 --> 01:02:17.341
Our daddy wrote
it with Marq Dunn.

01:02:20.676 --> 01:02:23.277
Meemaw,

01:02:23.279 --> 01:02:25.649
what did Miss Marq do
to make Mama so mad?

01:02:27.283 --> 01:02:28.819
All right then.

01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:33.321
When your daddy
met your mama

01:02:33.323 --> 01:02:36.123
he stopped chasing
his singing career.

01:02:36.125 --> 01:02:38.192
Now, Elizabeth did not tell him
to do that.

01:02:38.194 --> 01:02:40.629
That was his idea.

01:02:40.631 --> 01:02:43.464
He wanted to start a family.

01:02:43.466 --> 01:02:47.134
If he stayed with his music,
he'd be in Nashville right now.

01:02:47.136 --> 01:02:48.303
He'd be alive.

01:02:48.305 --> 01:02:50.638
And maybe you wouldn't be.

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:53.141
How's that sit with you?

01:02:53.143 --> 01:02:55.710
None of this explains why Mama
and Marq aren't friends.

01:02:55.712 --> 01:02:59.948
She's my daughter,
but I'm not inside her head.

01:02:59.950 --> 01:03:02.817
But I will tell you
one thing.

01:03:02.819 --> 01:03:06.654
No one loved your daddy's music
more than your mama.

01:03:06.656 --> 01:03:08.191
No one.

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:11.859
Now...

01:03:11.861 --> 01:03:13.862
play me something
that you been working on.

01:03:13.864 --> 01:03:16.531
Something that the two of you
wrote together.

01:03:16.533 --> 01:03:17.801
Don't make me beg.

01:03:24.575 --> 01:03:26.810
- "Hold On."
- Yeah.

01:03:28.712 --> 01:03:29.877

Elizabeth?

01:06:08.504 --> 01:06:10.839
Hi. Oh. Hi. Oh! Oh!

01:06:10.841 --> 01:06:11.906
- Heh.
- No! Oh, my goodness.

01:06:11.908 --> 01:06:14.842
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh. It's okay.

01:06:14.844 --> 01:06:16.411
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:06:16.413 --> 01:06:18.179
Uh...

01:06:18.181 --> 01:06:20.848
Uh, this is for you.

01:06:20.850 --> 01:06:23.685
I'm thinking
this is not a fan letter.

01:06:23.687 --> 01:06:26.020
It's an apology.

01:06:26.022 --> 01:06:29.056
You don't need to say
you're sorry for anything.

01:06:29.058 --> 01:06:31.394
Yeah, I do.

01:06:33.163 --> 01:06:35.099
Oh, hell. I'm sorry too.

01:06:37.268 --> 01:06:39.868
Uh, you wanna go on a walk?

01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:41.169
With the dogs?

01:06:41.171 --> 01:06:43.237
I know Caesar would like
to, uh, make up

01:06:43.239 --> 01:06:44.605
for his poor behavior.

01:06:44.607 --> 01:06:46.576
Sure.

01:06:48.379 --> 01:06:51.879
You don't have to read it.
It just says I'm sorry.

01:06:51.881 --> 01:06:54.616
For my part in all of it.

01:06:54.618 --> 01:06:56.618
Your part?

01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:58.788
Yeah.
For Brian leaving the band.

01:07:00.591 --> 01:07:03.524
No, no.
We gave it a shot.

01:07:03.526 --> 01:07:05.060
It didn't work out.

01:07:05.062 --> 01:07:07.795
I never meant
to take Brian away.

01:07:07.797 --> 01:07:11.466
You didn't take Brian away.
Brian met you

01:07:11.468 --> 01:07:14.234
and he didn't wanna stay up
all night writing songs with me.

01:07:15.571 --> 01:07:17.705
I get it now.

01:07:17.707 --> 01:07:19.074
I'm a handful.

01:07:19.076 --> 01:07:20.875
Yeah, but, uh...

01:07:20.877 --> 01:07:23.944
I should have called
a long time ago.

01:07:23.946 --> 01:07:27.281
It's a two-way street.

01:07:27.283 --> 01:07:31.386
I should've reached out more
after he died. That's, uh...

01:07:31.388 --> 01:07:33.120
Yeah, that's on me.

01:07:33.122 --> 01:07:34.455
Oh.

01:07:34.457 --> 01:07:35.922
I don't even remember
how I made it

01:07:35.924 --> 01:07:37.759
through those days.

01:07:37.761 --> 01:07:41.730
For a long time I had
some kind of magical thinking

01:07:41.732 --> 01:07:44.098
- that he would...
- He'd come back?

01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:45.803
Yeah.

01:07:49.272 --> 01:07:51.808
You have those
two beautiful girls.

01:07:53.743 --> 01:07:56.511
You've done a hell of job.

01:07:56.513 --> 01:07:58.015
Thank you.

01:07:59.448 --> 01:08:01.516
Eat me out of house
and home.

01:08:01.518 --> 01:08:03.250
Speaking of which,
are you hungry?

01:08:03.252 --> 01:08:04.585
Yeah. I am.

01:08:04.587 --> 01:08:06.323
Let's get some food.

01:08:08.325 --> 01:08:10.591
The music thing just scares me.

01:08:10.593 --> 01:08:12.828
That's why I push school
so hard.

01:08:12.830 --> 01:08:14.629
I think
they're gonna surprise you.

01:08:14.631 --> 01:08:16.163
I really do.

01:08:16.166 --> 01:08:18.799
At least you get to go to bed
with those two firecrackers

01:08:18.801 --> 01:08:20.000
under your roof.

01:08:20.002 --> 01:08:24.337
I turn the lights out
with two rescue dogs.

01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:28.310
Well, Piper snores.
So does Meemaw.

01:08:28.312 --> 01:08:32.813
You've been encouraging
my girls and I appreciate that.

01:08:32.814 --> 01:08:35.517
It was selfish.

01:08:35.519 --> 01:08:36.953
They make me feel good.

01:08:42.326 --> 01:08:45.326
Will you keep helping my girls
with their music?

01:08:45.328 --> 01:08:48.032
Would you be okay with that?

01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:52.069
I'd love it.

01:08:54.004 --> 01:08:55.906
It's a plan.

01:08:57.372 --> 01:08:59.874
Come on, let's eat.
We got years to catch up on.

01:08:59.876 --> 01:09:01.676
And I need to fatten you up.

01:09:01.678 --> 01:09:03.578
Fatten up? Hey.

01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:05.145
Sorry I'm so late!

01:09:05.148 --> 01:09:07.015
- We were worried sick.
- We called your cell,

01:09:07.017 --> 01:09:08.682
- we got your voicemail...
- My phone died.

01:09:08.684 --> 01:09:10.685
- I forgot my charger.
- You forgot your charger?

01:09:10.687 --> 01:09:12.353
- Yes, darling.
- We stopped by the café,

01:09:12.354 --> 01:09:13.921
they said
you weren't there all day.

01:09:13.924 --> 01:09:15.323
Place didn't burn down,
right?

01:09:15.325 --> 01:09:17.390
- Elizabeth, where were you?
- I went to Nashville.

01:09:17.393 --> 01:09:20.863
Turn down the radio down.

01:09:22.398 --> 01:09:25.066
Elizabeth, what is going on?

01:09:25.068 --> 01:09:29.036
Well, Mama, I visited Marq.

01:09:29.037 --> 01:09:31.606
Marq with a Q?

01:09:31.608 --> 01:09:33.207
Yes, baby. Marq Dunn.

01:09:33.209 --> 01:09:34.875
What in the Sam hell?

01:09:34.877 --> 01:09:35.910
Meemaw, language.

01:09:35.912 --> 01:09:37.544
We took the dogs
for a walk.

01:09:37.546 --> 01:09:39.846
And then we had
a real nice meal.

01:09:39.849 --> 01:09:42.082
Oh, we were so hungry.
I think it was all that talking.

01:09:42.085 --> 01:09:47.721
Honey, you and Marq
have never been friends.

01:09:47.724 --> 01:09:50.857
We've never been enemies
either.

01:09:50.859 --> 01:09:52.560
She and Brian
made great music together

01:09:52.563 --> 01:09:54.395
and I was...

01:09:54.397 --> 01:09:56.800
I was always jealous
of that.

01:09:58.301 --> 01:10:01.402
But I'm not the same person
I was then.

01:10:01.404 --> 01:10:03.404
We already made a plan
to see each other again.

01:10:03.406 --> 01:10:04.571
To walk dogs?

01:10:04.573 --> 01:10:06.240
No.

01:10:06.242 --> 01:10:08.142
There's a benefit concert
next week

01:10:08.144 --> 01:10:10.811
in Nashville for veterans.

01:10:10.813 --> 01:10:12.379
Marq's gonna be singing

01:10:12.381 --> 01:10:15.083
and she thought maybe
we'd all like to go with her.

01:10:15.085 --> 01:10:16.651
Really?

01:10:16.653 --> 01:10:18.986
As a way of honoring
your father.

01:10:18.988 --> 01:10:20.254
Am I in on this?

01:10:20.256 --> 01:10:22.289
Yes, Meemaw. It's time
to paint your butt white

01:10:22.291 --> 01:10:24.493
- and run with the antelope.
- Have you been drinking?

01:10:24.495 --> 01:10:27.428
No. This is a natural high.

01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:29.262
And I guess years
in the making.

01:10:29.264 --> 01:10:30.498
I'm not done.

01:10:31.667 --> 01:10:33.435
We are driving over
to the veterans' home

01:10:33.437 --> 01:10:35.770
to ask your friend C.J.
if he'd like to go with us.

01:10:35.772 --> 01:10:38.138
This is crazy.

01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:39.441
Ada, you wanna call Declan

01:10:39.443 --> 01:10:41.342
and see if he's interested
in the concert?

01:10:41.344 --> 01:10:43.811
- I'd like to meet him.
- Thanks, Mama.

01:10:43.813 --> 01:10:46.448
What about Justine?

01:10:46.450 --> 01:10:47.850
It's not her fault we lied.

01:10:49.586 --> 01:10:52.286
Justine too.

01:10:52.288 --> 01:10:55.123
We've got a new rule
in this family.

01:10:55.125 --> 01:10:56.958
No secrets.

01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:00.160
Knock me over with a feather
and paint my butt white.

01:11:03.299 --> 01:11:06.133

01:11:15.045 --> 01:11:16.645
- Hey.
- This is our mama.

01:11:16.647 --> 01:11:19.347
Elizabeth.
So nice to meet you.

01:11:19.349 --> 01:11:20.882
And our Meemaw.

01:11:20.884 --> 01:11:22.517
Pleasure to meet you.

01:11:22.519 --> 01:11:26.987
I finally get to meet
the world's greatest pie maker.

01:11:26.989 --> 01:11:28.490
Oh, please.

01:11:28.492 --> 01:11:30.825
Never underestimate
your talent.

01:11:30.827 --> 01:11:33.194
Oh, I have many talents.

01:11:33.196 --> 01:11:35.329
Like what, Meemaw?

01:11:35.331 --> 01:11:37.899
Uh, we brought pies
for the whole place.

01:11:37.901 --> 01:11:39.700
There are a lot more
in the car.

01:11:39.702 --> 01:11:42.837
All right. Let's eat.

01:12:00.389 --> 01:12:02.423
Hey, Monroe.

01:12:02.425 --> 01:12:03.857
Come on over here.

01:12:03.859 --> 01:12:05.727
I gotta get back
to reception.

01:12:05.729 --> 01:12:08.499
After you meet somebody.

01:12:12.234 --> 01:12:16.672
Mama, I'd like you to meet
a friend of Daddy's.

01:12:27.850 --> 01:12:30.384
I'm Elizabeth Spencer.

01:12:30.386 --> 01:12:32.553
You served with my husband?

01:12:32.555 --> 01:12:35.556
Yes, ma'am.

01:12:35.558 --> 01:12:38.629
It's a pleasure
to meet you, sir.

01:12:49.371 --> 01:12:52.041
Brian would have been
real proud of his daughters.

01:13:08.224 --> 01:13:10.258
Okay.

01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:11.962
I'm gonna need
some more pie.

01:13:15.898 --> 01:13:18.669
Justine's here!
We're gonna be late!

01:13:23.439 --> 01:13:25.306
Holy cow, Meemaw.

01:13:25.308 --> 01:13:27.674
I went all the way
to Shelbyville salon

01:13:27.676 --> 01:13:29.343
and I asked for a beehive.

01:13:29.345 --> 01:13:31.311
Well,
you got a Marge Simpson.

01:13:31.313 --> 01:13:33.347
Too late to undo it.

01:13:33.349 --> 01:13:35.450
I guess I should
consider myself lucky.

01:13:35.452 --> 01:13:36.450
How's that?

01:13:36.452 --> 01:13:37.785
It'll wash out.

01:13:38.921 --> 01:13:40.454
Well, I like it.

01:13:40.456 --> 01:13:42.022
- Ada!
- Coming!

01:13:42.024 --> 01:13:45.526
I just wouldn't wanna be
sitting behind you at a concert.

01:13:45.528 --> 01:13:47.328
Hey, y'all.

01:13:47.330 --> 01:13:49.963
Oh, darling,
you girls look so pretty,

01:13:49.965 --> 01:13:51.966
you make folks
glad to be alive.

01:13:51.968 --> 01:13:55.837
Thanks, Meemaw.
Your hair is insane.

01:13:55.839 --> 01:13:56.971
Agreed.

01:13:56.973 --> 01:14:00.475
You do have
that Tennessee glow, Ada.

01:14:00.477 --> 01:14:03.011
That's because Declan's
gonna be there.

01:14:03.013 --> 01:14:05.346
All right, all right.
We'll pick on your sister

01:14:05.348 --> 01:14:07.548
in the truck. Let's go!

01:14:07.550 --> 01:14:09.150
Too bad you don't have
a sunroof.

01:14:09.152 --> 01:14:10.985
Meemaw's high hair
could stick out the top.

01:14:10.987 --> 01:14:13.687
I heard that.

01:14:15.992 --> 01:14:17.124
Where's Marq?

01:14:17.126 --> 01:14:19.494
She's joining us
after it all starts.

01:14:19.496 --> 01:14:21.128
That's how famous people
do it.

01:14:21.130 --> 01:14:22.864
They wait
till the light's out.

01:14:22.866 --> 01:14:24.234
How was I
supposed to know that?

01:14:25.667 --> 01:14:27.868
Hi!

01:14:27.870 --> 01:14:29.870
- You're not late.
- No.

01:14:29.872 --> 01:14:32.473
Mama, Meemaw,
this is Declan.

01:14:32.475 --> 01:14:33.508
- Hello.
- How are you?

01:14:33.510 --> 01:14:34.875
- Hi.
- I'm so pleased to meet you.

01:14:34.877 --> 01:14:37.212
Thank you so much
for inviting me tonight.

01:14:37.214 --> 01:14:38.478
What do you think?

01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:40.013
Does she have
the Tennessee glow?

01:14:40.015 --> 01:14:41.716
Hell, yeah.
That glow is how I found you.

01:14:41.718 --> 01:14:43.351
Oh, I like him already.

01:14:43.353 --> 01:14:46.186
Except for that language.

01:14:46.188 --> 01:14:47.387
<i>Sorry.</i>

01:14:47.389 --> 01:14:48.856
- Hey there, everybody.
- Hi!

01:14:48.858 --> 01:14:50.357
How're you doing?

01:14:51.493 --> 01:14:53.527
Mr. Monroe,
this is a surprise.

01:14:53.529 --> 01:14:56.397
What? That I like music?
Or that I'd go to a concert?

01:14:56.399 --> 01:14:58.098
Both.

01:14:58.100 --> 01:14:59.901
I told you,
he was just a growler.

01:14:59.903 --> 01:15:01.268
I got my reasons.

01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:02.503
Well, don't go into them.

01:15:02.505 --> 01:15:05.373
- So happy to see you again.
- Likewise.

01:15:05.375 --> 01:15:07.708
Let's talk later. Come on,
we need to get our seats.

01:15:07.710 --> 01:15:09.543
- Okay.
- Let me help you.

01:15:09.545 --> 01:15:11.445
Are you still making
those wonderful pies?

01:15:11.447 --> 01:15:13.446
Oh, I am. I am.

01:15:21.257 --> 01:15:22.890
We're all here tonight
to raise money

01:15:22.892 --> 01:15:24.292
for our wounded veterans.

01:15:24.294 --> 01:15:26.694
So thank you
for being a part of this.

01:15:26.696 --> 01:15:28.429
We've got some surprises
for you tonight

01:15:28.431 --> 01:15:30.897
and we're kicking it off
with the biggest one.

01:15:30.899 --> 01:15:33.534
Ladies and gentlemen,
give a big welcome

01:15:33.536 --> 01:15:35.802
to Mr. Willie Nelson!

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:46.446
Willie!

01:15:49.818 --> 01:15:52.320
I love you!

01:15:52.322 --> 01:15:54.155
- Whoa!
- Willie Nelson!

01:15:55.424 --> 01:15:58.394
Willie!

01:15:59.595 --> 01:16:02.096
Thank you very much.

01:16:02.098 --> 01:16:05.266
I'm proud to be here
for the veterans.

01:16:05.268 --> 01:16:07.634
A Marine named Brian Spencer
wrote a great song

01:16:07.636 --> 01:16:10.436
before he lost his life
for his country,

01:16:10.438 --> 01:16:12.106
and his family is here

01:16:12.108 --> 01:16:14.674
and I'm gonna ask
his two daughters to come up

01:16:14.676 --> 01:16:16.311
and, uh, sing this song
with me.

01:16:16.313 --> 01:16:17.744
Let's give them
a big welcome.

01:16:20.149 --> 01:16:22.950
Oh. Oh!

01:16:22.952 --> 01:16:24.855
Whoo!

01:16:27.255 --> 01:16:28.791
Go, girls!

01:16:34.430 --> 01:16:36.164
Three chords and the truth,

01:16:36.166 --> 01:16:38.132
that's what a country song is.
Right, girls?

01:16:38.134 --> 01:16:39.967
