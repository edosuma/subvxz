ANDY COHEN: Tonight, on
the <i>Inside Amy Schumer</i> reunion...

00:04.471 --> 00:06.530
What was that just now
when I just said it to Andy Cohen?

00:06.606 --> 00:07.664
A lie?

00:07.741 --> 00:08.901
You mix reds and whites.

00:08.975 --> 00:10.636
I've got your infection right here.

00:10.710 --> 00:13.474
No, I do not wanna have brunch,
thank you for asking.

00:17.050 --> 00:18.642
Hey, everybody, I'm Andy Cohen.

00:18.718 --> 00:21.209
And I'm here with the beautiful and beguiling

00:21.287 --> 00:23.812
ladies of <i>Inside Amy Schumer.</i>

00:23.890 --> 00:28.350
You all look so amazing
and classy and stunning.

00:28.428 --> 00:29.486
Yes.

00:29.562 --> 00:30.790
Hi, Amy Schumer.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.491
Hi, Andy Cohen.

00:32.966 --> 00:35.662
Amy, I love your hair, very <i>Barbarella.</i>

00:35.735 --> 00:37.430
Oh, thank you, um...

00:37.504 --> 00:40.405
I wanted something different and, um...

00:40.473 --> 00:42.304
With my new line coming out.

00:42.375 --> 00:44.104
And my name was almost Barbara.

00:44.177 --> 00:46.668
So that's very funny you mention that.

00:46.746 --> 00:48.839
'Cause my line is coming out.

00:48.915 --> 00:50.280
Hi, Kim Caramele.

00:50.350 --> 00:51.408
Hi, Andy Cohen.

00:51.484 --> 00:55.853
Gosh, supervising producer,
writer, Amy's sister...

00:55.922 --> 00:58.618
Look at you. You look like a princess.

00:58.691 --> 01:00.090
You look like Kate Middleton.

01:00.160 --> 01:02.390
Thank you,
but, like, what I always say about that

01:02.462 --> 01:04.453
is just, like, I just do me.

01:04.531 --> 01:06.226
And then that's it, like, I do me.

01:06.299 --> 01:09.393
I've literally never heard you
say that your whole life.

01:09.469 --> 01:11.664
And, like, I've known you your whole life.

01:11.738 --> 01:14.639
Oh, do you have ears?
'Cause, like, I just said it to Andy Cohen.

01:14.707 --> 01:16.937
- What are these on my head?
- Check the tape, check the tape.

01:17.010 --> 01:18.204
- What are these on my head?
- Check the tape.

01:18.278 --> 01:19.302
- ANDY: Check the tape.
- What are these?

01:19.379 --> 01:20.539
- ANDY: Check the tape.
- Check the tape.

01:20.613 --> 01:22.308
- What are these on my head?
- Check the tape.

01:22.382 --> 01:23.406
KIM: They're ears.

01:26.586 --> 01:29.020
Greta Lee, you've been
on the show every season.

01:29.089 --> 01:32.320
Yes, but I've yet to be paid
for any of my appearances.

01:32.392 --> 01:34.360
But on the plus side, you are Asian.

01:36.262 --> 01:38.526
- Hi, Bridget Everett.
- Hi, Andy Cohen.

01:38.598 --> 01:41.089
Bridget Everett, you are a socialite,

01:41.167 --> 01:44.102
you're a debutante,
you're a goddamn legend.

01:44.170 --> 01:45.501
Hi, Andy Cohen.

01:47.273 --> 01:48.535
Hi, Amy Schumer.

01:49.008 --> 01:50.532
Hi... Andy Cohen.

01:50.610 --> 01:52.669
Are we still doing hellos? I thought...

01:52.745 --> 01:56.511
Oh, yeah, the hellos on reunion shows
last for about half an hour.

01:56.583 --> 01:58.983
- Hi, Andy Cohen.
- Well, this show is only a half-hour,

01:59.052 --> 02:01.282
so, like, let's move it along.

02:01.387 --> 02:02.376
ANDY: Oh, okay.

02:02.455 --> 02:05.515
Listen, let's take a look at some
of the most memorable moments

02:05.592 --> 02:07.423
from the first three seasons. Watch.

02:08.328 --> 02:12.321
Hi, I'm Amy Schumer, and I'm proud to say
that I'm a feminist.

02:12.398 --> 02:15.265
That's why today, I'm hosting
my very own gang bang.

02:15.335 --> 02:17.633
If nobody needs anything else,
honey, I'm gonna head upstairs.

02:17.704 --> 02:20.229
Start lubing up so you can blast
my dirt box with your thumb

02:20.306 --> 02:22.103
while you lobster hand me in the twat, okay?

02:22.175 --> 02:24.700
And then you can shit on my tits
while I call my mom, mwah.

02:24.777 --> 02:27.507
- God?
- For me to undo your herpes,

02:27.580 --> 02:31.107
I'd have to kill off an entire village
in Uzbekistan.

02:31.184 --> 02:33.118
Yeah, whatever you think is best, do it.

02:33.186 --> 02:35.780
I really need to stop
making so many white girls.

02:35.855 --> 02:37.322
I'm going to get my dildo.

02:37.390 --> 02:39.324
- Boom!
- (ALL LAUGHING)

02:39.425 --> 02:40.414
First of all,

02:40.493 --> 02:43.326
no one feel any pressure
to unload everything.

02:44.230 --> 02:45.891
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

02:45.965 --> 02:48.490
This is just a case of slut shaming.

02:48.968 --> 02:51.994
But this slut is not ashamed.

02:52.071 --> 02:54.699
Heading to the can. Gonna make some room.

02:54.774 --> 02:56.071
My boner just got a boner.

02:56.242 --> 02:59.302
Amy, I'm Willenby, your royal attachÃ©.

02:59.379 --> 03:01.244
It's time you knew the truth.

03:01.314 --> 03:04.249
You're not a disgusting,
filthy commoner at all.

03:04.317 --> 03:06.512
You're a princess!

03:07.387 --> 03:08.945
A princess?

03:09.255 --> 03:10.279
Me?

03:10.356 --> 03:11.846
(SINGING) <i>Girl, you don't need makeup</i>

03:11.925 --> 03:13.392
<i>You're perfect when you wake up...</i>

03:13.459 --> 03:15.051
WOMAN: (OVER PA) <i>Excuse me, shoppers.</i>

03:15.128 --> 03:18.029
<i>Amy is the prettiest customer</i>
<i>we've ever had in here.</i>

03:18.097 --> 03:20.759
Oh, my God, I look so great with bangs!

03:20.833 --> 03:22.391
I know, right? Ahh!

03:22.468 --> 03:26.302
In every actress' life, the media decides
when you finally reach the point

03:26.372 --> 03:28.863
where you're not believably
fuckable anymore.

03:28.942 --> 03:30.000
Who tells you?

03:30.076 --> 03:33.068
She's built like a lineman
and she has Cabbage Patch-like features.

03:33.146 --> 03:34.807
Her ass makes me furious!

03:34.881 --> 03:37.372
I'd give that ass a... A four?

03:37.450 --> 03:40.146
Really good tits, but her face was just okay.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.209
(SCREAMING)

03:41.287 --> 03:42.982
I got no damn arms!

03:43.056 --> 03:44.853
Have you always been a fucking trash heap?

03:44.924 --> 03:47.586
- You guys want some of this here burrito?
- No.

03:47.660 --> 03:49.025
- Burrito?
- No.

03:49.095 --> 03:50.926
When I said, "I want a ton of soy sauce,"

03:50.997 --> 03:55.024
what you heard was,
"I want... two soy sauces"?

03:55.101 --> 03:56.762
AMY: <i>My dream for the future is</i>

03:57.270 --> 04:00.137
right now, that somebody
brings us some curly fries.

04:00.206 --> 04:02.106
Just soak up all the booze.
We're just like drinking

04:02.175 --> 04:04.109
and it's like, ugh, perfect storm.

04:04.177 --> 04:06.737
I was cyberbullying my niece
on Instagram the other day,

04:06.813 --> 04:10.112
and I literally ate 15 mini muffins, I'm so bad.

04:10.183 --> 04:12.708
Fuck you, I'm a fucking cow.

04:12.785 --> 04:14.582
Indian people are trying to worship me.

04:14.654 --> 04:15.985
I sleep standing up in a field.

04:16.289 --> 04:18.017
(SINGING) <i>Happy birth...</i>

04:18.091 --> 04:20.355
Amy! When did you get back from Iraq?

04:20.426 --> 04:21.983
This isn't working for me.

04:22.060 --> 04:24.552
I think we should see other people.

04:25.999 --> 04:27.990
This is so the universe telling me,

04:28.067 --> 04:30.661
"Girl, just, like, keep fucking
your married boss," right?

04:30.737 --> 04:34.332
I'm not asking that you finger bang me
in the back of my Tercel like it's 1997.

04:34.407 --> 04:36.272
I'm just asking for a chance
to make a difference.

04:36.342 --> 04:37.900
These are the best years of your lives

04:37.977 --> 04:39.842
because you're fucking losers!

04:39.979 --> 04:42.004
Wooorms!

04:42.582 --> 04:43.913
(FARTING)

04:43.983 --> 04:46.474
Women are funny, women are funny.

04:46.552 --> 04:49.316
I am not my fucking mother!

04:49.389 --> 04:50.447
Ha!

04:51.324 --> 04:52.348
Oh!

04:52.458 --> 04:54.289
Ooh! Oh!

04:55.461 --> 04:57.053
Whoo! Oh!

04:59.198 --> 05:00.825
Cocaine is the cat's pajamas!

05:00.900 --> 05:02.959
It's gonna be a stank night, girl.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.334
You know what? Round of drinks on me.

05:05.405 --> 05:06.463
Wow!

05:06.673 --> 05:08.903
ALL: (CHANTING) Amy, Amy, Amy...

05:08.975 --> 05:10.408
BOTH: Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug.

05:10.476 --> 05:13.536
- So let's raise a glass...
- (ELECTRICAL BUZZING)

05:13.613 --> 05:14.773
Bing.

05:16.816 --> 05:19.148
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug.

05:19.218 --> 05:20.617

05:38.604 --> 05:40.265
You guys don't even know I'm cooler.

05:40.606 --> 05:41.834
Ah! Oh!

05:41.908 --> 05:43.705
I am a good person.

05:44.043 --> 05:45.271
I like this good show.

05:45.345 --> 05:48.872
Last time I checked,
good plus good did not equal guilty.

05:48.948 --> 05:50.313
Now let's get out there!

05:50.383 --> 05:53.318
Clear eyes, full hearts.

05:53.519 --> 05:54.577
ALL: Don't rape!

05:54.654 --> 05:56.019
We're doing God's work.

05:59.659 --> 06:02.856
Okay, Mavis L. From
Rancho Cucamonga writes,

06:02.929 --> 06:06.160
"Amy, why do you talk
about your pussy so much?

06:06.232 --> 06:08.530
"Are you scared we don't
believe you have one?

06:08.601 --> 06:10.933
"We get it. You're disgusting."

06:11.003 --> 06:14.461
I have to say that I have no idea
what that is in reference to.

06:14.540 --> 06:15.734
(SNICKERING)

06:15.808 --> 06:17.275
Uh, you know.

06:18.745 --> 06:19.939
No idea.

06:20.012 --> 06:21.036
- You know.
- We all know.

06:21.114 --> 06:25.107
I have literally never in my life

06:25.184 --> 06:27.414
said that word before, so...

06:28.654 --> 06:29.678
What did you just say?

06:29.756 --> 06:31.451
- I said you're delusional!
- What did you just say?

06:31.524 --> 06:33.958
- Say it to my face!
- I said "You're day-Ioo..."

06:34.026 --> 06:35.550
(BOTH SHOUTING)

06:36.863 --> 06:38.387
I said you're delusional!

06:38.464 --> 06:40.125
You don't even know what delusional means!

06:40.199 --> 06:41.530
You don't know what it means.

06:41.601 --> 06:43.501
- You don't know what anything means!
- I'm not delusional.

06:43.569 --> 06:45.059
Yeah, you always take her side!

06:45.138 --> 06:46.332
No, you know what? I can't, no.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.430
KIM: Sit down.

06:47.507 --> 06:50.135
- Good, good, walk out like you always do.
- I'm not, I'm not.

06:50.209 --> 06:52.734
- Walk out like you always do.
- No, because you know why I'm not?

06:52.812 --> 06:55.372
Because, because you know why I'm not!

06:55.448 --> 06:57.541
And what you wrote is very hurtful to me.

06:57.617 --> 06:59.209
I didn't say anything!

06:59.285 --> 07:01.412
- It's very hurtful to me!
- Prove it!

07:01.487 --> 07:03.352
I didn't say anything!

07:03.856 --> 07:04.982
Sit back down, Amy.

07:05.057 --> 07:06.354
- Okay.
- ANDY: Come back.

07:06.526 --> 07:08.289
Sit down, Kim.

07:09.462 --> 07:11.862
Amy, are you seriously saying

07:11.931 --> 07:14.525
that you've never said the word "pussy"?

07:14.767 --> 07:19.170
Andy, on my life, never!

07:19.238 --> 07:23.334
Never have I ever said that word on my life.

07:23.409 --> 07:25.036
On my children's lives!

07:25.111 --> 07:26.806
On my children's children's lives.

07:26.879 --> 07:28.574
Never have I said that word.

07:28.648 --> 07:32.106
That's family, and you don't do that to family.

07:32.185 --> 07:35.416
Wait, are you saying your pussy is family?

07:36.189 --> 07:37.656
She knows what I'm talking about.

07:37.723 --> 07:39.156
Nobody knows what you're talking about!

07:39.225 --> 07:40.886
- You know what I'm talking about!
- Nobody knows!

07:40.960 --> 07:42.791
Nobody knows.

07:42.862 --> 07:47.322
Okay, well, let's see what everybody
is talking about. Take a look.

07:47.400 --> 07:48.992
- Close your eyes.
- Okay.

07:49.068 --> 07:51.002
- Give me your hand.
- Mmm-hmm.

07:51.070 --> 07:54.733
Guess where your finger is right now.
My pussy.

07:54.807 --> 07:56.434
My pussy tastes like nothing.

07:56.509 --> 07:57.771
'Cause I ate pussy for breakfast.

07:57.844 --> 08:00.745
I hope this kid's ready to eat a ton of pussy.

08:00.813 --> 08:01.802
- Pussies.
- Pussy.

08:01.881 --> 08:04.577
- Pussy!
- Stop talking out of your pussy right now.

08:04.650 --> 08:07.016
If my pussy had a voice,
it would sound like Terry Gross

08:07.086 --> 08:08.883
with just a mouthful of crackers.

08:08.955 --> 08:11.116
My character has a pussy.

08:11.190 --> 08:13.852
- Pussies.
- Can you not say pussy?

08:13.960 --> 08:16.019
(SINGING) <i>My pussy's fucking magic</i>

08:16.095 --> 08:17.153
With a pussy on it.

08:17.230 --> 08:20.256
I don't see what's so hard about
just saying "vagina."

08:20.333 --> 08:22.995
Will this fix my garbage pussy?

08:23.069 --> 08:25.264
Are you that girl from the television

08:25.338 --> 08:27.704
who talks about her pussy all the time?

08:28.140 --> 08:29.198
Yes!

08:29.542 --> 08:33.171
Kinda seems like you say "pussy" a lot, Amy.

08:33.246 --> 08:34.508
Thank you.

08:35.347 --> 08:37.179
I see why you would think that.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.946
And I, I want to sincere-iously apologize

08:40.019 --> 08:43.580
to my fans if that's what
they thought I was saying.

08:43.923 --> 08:45.686
But I have grown a lot.

08:45.758 --> 08:50.195
This has been a journey with me and God.

08:50.596 --> 08:53.997
And everyone at the precinct near my house.

08:54.333 --> 08:55.994
And I know what's in my heart.

08:56.068 --> 08:58.366
And it is my pussy.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.800
Okay, I mean...
(STAMMERS) And I do wanna say this.

09:03.876 --> 09:05.434
I do wanna say this about Amy, okay?

09:05.511 --> 09:07.775
- I know that we have had our differences.
- Mmm-hmm.

09:07.847 --> 09:10.941
And I know that she knows that I do hate her.

09:11.017 --> 09:14.350
Okay, but she also does say that, like,
she has a good heart.

09:14.420 --> 09:17.912
Okay, and she says she has
a good heart and family is family.

09:17.990 --> 09:19.287
Thank you for saying that.

09:19.358 --> 09:22.225
- Family is family.
- Family is family.

09:22.295 --> 09:24.286
(SOBBING) Family is family.

09:24.363 --> 09:26.194
ANDY: That's nice, that was kind of you.

09:26.265 --> 09:27.425
We'll be right back.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.695
- ANDY: <i>When we come back...</i>
- Also, I've never seen

09:29.769 --> 09:31.259
you eat food in your life.

09:31.337 --> 09:32.361
(GASPING)

09:35.675 --> 09:40.169
We are back with the
<i>Real Ladies Inside Amy Schumer</i> reunion.

09:40.246 --> 09:42.840
And we're joined by some very special guests.

09:42.915 --> 09:45.179
Kevin Kane, your supervising producer,

09:45.251 --> 09:49.187
and you're also Amy's
creative partner and best friend.

09:49.255 --> 09:50.984
And also you look like Kurt Russell

09:51.057 --> 09:52.957
if his mom did it with a Kennedy,

09:53.025 --> 09:55.118
but, like, one of the Florida Kennedys.

09:55.227 --> 09:56.717
Yeah, I get that a lot.

09:56.796 --> 09:58.093
And Sean Penn.

09:58.164 --> 10:00.325
Uh, Andy C. From Manhattan

10:00.399 --> 10:03.527
writes on this index card
that I'm reading from,

10:03.603 --> 10:06.094
"Why are you so mean to Amy, Kevin?"

10:06.172 --> 10:08.470
I would say to Andy C.'s face

10:08.541 --> 10:10.168
that I'm not mean.

10:10.242 --> 10:13.541
I am just an honest person,
and I tell it like it is.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.173
And I know how Kevin treats me
when we're alone

10:16.248 --> 10:19.979
- and it's nobody's business.
- KEVIN: That's right, it's nobody's business.

10:20.052 --> 10:21.781
No, we love each other.

10:21.854 --> 10:23.617
I wouldn't say that.

10:23.689 --> 10:26.681
You know, I would say, like, a moderate like.

10:27.059 --> 10:29.653
ANDY: Okay, well, let's see what you did say.
Take a look.

10:30.363 --> 10:31.853
Do we really have to do this?

10:31.931 --> 10:34.422
Yes, we're not communicating, we need help.

10:34.500 --> 10:35.967
We're not communicating?

10:36.035 --> 10:37.366
Yeah, we're not communicating.

10:37.436 --> 10:38.664
I don't even know what
you're saying right now.

10:38.738 --> 10:39.830
What are these, Kevin?

10:39.905 --> 10:40.997
(BELL JINGLING)

10:41.073 --> 10:42.062
I don't know, what are those?

10:42.141 --> 10:43.472
They look like clown panties.

10:43.542 --> 10:46.010
Why are there clown panties
crumpled up in our hallway?

10:46.078 --> 10:47.067
Are those not yours?

10:47.146 --> 10:49.171
I'm gonna pee so I don't get a UTI again.

10:49.248 --> 10:50.510
- Wait.
- What?

10:50.583 --> 10:51.572
Risk it.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.745
I had an orgasm, probably the biggest one
I've ever had in my life.

10:55.287 --> 10:57.050
You, Phil?

10:57.123 --> 10:58.818
I didn't, I didn't even come close.

10:58.891 --> 11:00.449
Nobody touched me.

11:00.526 --> 11:01.925
I went to the bathroom at one point.

11:01.994 --> 11:03.291
You guys didn't even realize.

11:03.362 --> 11:04.852
No, it's too late, Phil!

11:04.930 --> 11:06.830
He never has sex with me, like, at all.

11:06.899 --> 11:08.025
It's because I don't want to.

11:08.100 --> 11:09.658
And Amy, how does that make you feel?

11:09.735 --> 11:12.670
That makes me feel unattractive,
Chrissy Teigen.

11:12.738 --> 11:14.831
I definitely don't think she's protagonist hot.

11:14.907 --> 11:17.501
"Honk, honk," that's the type
of shit you text to a clown.

11:17.576 --> 11:18.770
- Oh!
- You are fucking!

11:18.844 --> 11:20.402
I can't believe you took my phone!

11:20.479 --> 11:23.312
You work with someone at
Deloitte & Touche named Sparkles?

11:23.382 --> 11:25.907
Yes, Sparkles Biederman!

11:26.385 --> 11:28.148
He's been there for years.

11:28.220 --> 11:29.209
He's Dutch.

11:29.288 --> 11:30.687
(SNIFFING) Can you smell this?

11:30.756 --> 11:31.882
- Ew, no, oh...
- Can you smell? Smell.

11:31.957 --> 11:33.185
Oh, my God, no, stop!

11:33.259 --> 11:34.590
I just wish you hadn't been yelling,

11:34.660 --> 11:36.525
"This feels so right."

11:37.229 --> 11:38.821
How do you know I wasn't talking about you?

11:41.467 --> 11:44.459

11:54.547 --> 11:56.606
I just, I get so scared of losing you.

Oh, that was hot as shit.

- Hey, Dan Powell.
- Hey, Andy.

12:09.328 --> 12:11.990
Executive producer. I love that tight V.

12:12.064 --> 12:13.463
You're really pulling it off.

12:13.532 --> 12:15.625
Thanks. You know I like the V.

Dan, your fellow executive producer

12:19.538 --> 12:22.063
and head writer for the show, Jessi Klein,

12:22.141 --> 12:25.872
couldn't be here tonight
because she is in prison.

12:28.147 --> 12:32.675
On a happier note, here's someone who could
always bring a smile to anyone's face,

12:32.752 --> 12:37.189
writer, performer
and producer in name only, Kyle Dunnigan.

12:37.256 --> 12:38.484
How you doin', Andy?

12:38.557 --> 12:42.084
Kyle, people aren't always
just laughing at you.

12:42.161 --> 12:45.221
Sometimes they're laughing with you.
Take a look.

12:45.631 --> 12:49.067
I'm gonna be this huge rapper
with lots of money and fame.

12:49.135 --> 12:51.660
And you're, like, in this bed acting a fool.

Welcome back to <i>Inside Amy Schumer,</i>

13:48.194 --> 13:50.856
the contractually obligated clip show.

13:51.130 --> 13:54.497
Wow, it's been a great way
to end the season, Amy.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.762
Is this the last episode? I thought we were...

13:56.836 --> 13:58.098
Don't we do 10?

13:58.170 --> 14:00.900
Uh, no, uh, I guess you wouldn't.

14:00.973 --> 14:02.497
Remember when you said
you'd wanna only do eight

14:02.575 --> 14:05.305
- and phone in the ninth, remember that?
- Right.

14:05.377 --> 14:07.743
Anyway, it's sad to say goodbye, I guess.

14:07.813 --> 14:10.714
But before we go, Amy, you have
some new projects coming up.

14:10.783 --> 14:11.841
You're keeping busy.

14:11.917 --> 14:13.782
Yes, Andy, thank you very much.

14:13.853 --> 14:17.050
Um, please sign up for my class
at the Learning Annex.

14:17.122 --> 14:19.147
It's called "It's Your Pee."

14:19.325 --> 14:21.384
BOTH: "Make It So."

14:21.560 --> 14:24.188
All right, and I am guest bartending
at McFadden's

14:24.263 --> 14:26.629
both on Tuesdays, Wednesdays,

14:26.699 --> 14:27.757
and they will add Thursdays

14:27.833 --> 14:30.666
if people turn out like they keep promising.

14:30.736 --> 14:34.968
Okay, and then also my line,
my makeup, as everyone knows.

14:35.040 --> 14:38.373
It is a non-organic, um, makeup line.

14:38.444 --> 14:39.433
It's tested on animals.

14:39.511 --> 14:41.877
No, it is not tested on animals!

14:41.947 --> 14:43.778
No, it is not, it is made...

14:43.849 --> 14:45.783
BOTH: From animals.

14:45.851 --> 14:49.014
Okay, made from real animals and then,
and then tested on animals.

14:50.322 --> 14:51.914
And Kevin is coming out

14:51.991 --> 14:55.324
with his own condiment
called Kevin's Condiments.

14:55.394 --> 14:58.989
It's mayo, ketchup, mustard all in one.

14:59.064 --> 15:00.929
I know, I'm saying it.

15:01.433 --> 15:04.266
Anyway, my makeup line
is called Totally Amy.

15:04.336 --> 15:09.296
And it's all about being real
and keeping it real.

15:09.808 --> 15:12.299
And it is really made from animals.

15:12.711 --> 15:14.702
Nice. Are you wearing some now?

15:14.780 --> 15:16.372
No, gross.

15:16.448 --> 15:19.679
Well, Amy you don't just
have a remarkable rapport

15:19.752 --> 15:22.619
with everybody here except your sister.

15:22.688 --> 15:24.952
You also can talk to the man on the street.

15:25.024 --> 15:28.585
Let's see what I'm trying to
awkwardly set up, take a look.

15:29.194 --> 15:32.630
I really don't like to dance out on the street,
but, what!

15:34.133 --> 15:35.395
What do you call that?

15:35.467 --> 15:37.059
I dropped something.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.365
Do you like when a girl has an accent?

15:39.438 --> 15:41.372
- Yeah.
- What about English?

15:42.041 --> 15:43.030
How does that sound?

15:43.108 --> 15:44.507
(LOUD COCKNEY ACCENT)
It sounds like this!

15:44.576 --> 15:46.009
Oh, no, that's all right.

15:46.078 --> 15:49.070
Have you ever shopped online
when you were drunk or high?

15:49.148 --> 15:51.446
I bought a, um...

15:52.318 --> 15:55.344
A star, like, you name a star after you.

15:58.324 --> 15:59.814
I'm not joking.

15:59.892 --> 16:02.793
- That is the saddest thing I've ever heard.
- It's horrible, right?

16:02.861 --> 16:05.022
I was just saying how glad
I was that I wasn't drunk

16:05.097 --> 16:07.429
doing this interview,
but now I'm, like, I wish I was drunk.

16:07.499 --> 16:10.434
People usually need a couple drinks
just to get through a conversation with me.

16:10.502 --> 16:12.367
- Are you high?
- Yeah, hell, yeah.

16:12.438 --> 16:14.201
Have you ever had a one-night stand?

16:17.643 --> 16:20.134
Okay, have you ever not
had a one-night stand?

16:20.212 --> 16:21.907
- Yes, I have had a one-night stand.
- Oh!

16:21.981 --> 16:24.415
I had, like, a one-afternoon stand.

16:24.483 --> 16:26.508
- And then I couldn't find him, but, you know...
- Okay.

16:26.585 --> 16:28.109
Yankee Stadium is so big.

16:28.187 --> 16:29.552
- Porn.
- Oh, yeah.

16:29.621 --> 16:32.749
- I didn't even ask anything.
- Don't worry about it, it's fantastic.

16:32.825 --> 16:35.225
I'm Taurus, so I'm kind of a sensual lover.

16:35.294 --> 16:36.556
I'm really passionate.

16:36.628 --> 16:39.256
Did you guys just hear that?
My underwear just fell off.

16:39.331 --> 16:41.526
I like a great sense of humor
and, like, some wit

16:41.600 --> 16:43.693
and some intelligence, I don't know...

16:43.769 --> 16:45.828
Flick your tongue very quickly.

16:45.904 --> 16:49.931
If he's uncut and the skin
covers the tip of the penis

16:50.009 --> 16:54.503
when he withdraws the penis,
he becomes very sensitive, so...

16:55.114 --> 16:56.706
(LAUGHING)

16:57.416 --> 16:58.576
What do you see?

16:58.650 --> 17:00.049
A vagina, maybe.

17:00.552 --> 17:02.645
Come here, come here, that was right.

17:02.721 --> 17:04.551
Have you ever had Ambien sex?

17:04.623 --> 17:06.488
Is that with, like, lights and shit?

17:06.558 --> 17:07.684
I don't remember.

17:07.760 --> 17:10.319
You have to be real careful
not to do drugs and black out

17:10.496 --> 17:14.193
'cause you could wind up with
your own motherfucking TV show!

17:15.501 --> 17:16.525
ANDY: <i>When we come back...</i>

17:16.602 --> 17:19.093
Gucci, you're a writer
and producer on the show.

17:19.171 --> 17:20.330
AMY: They all are.

17:20.406 --> 17:22.567
Gucci's the head writer, though.

17:22.641 --> 17:24.472
Yes, you were the head writer.

17:29.014 --> 17:31.847
Okay, here's something we hastily edited.

17:32.084 --> 17:33.813
Cece, you're six years old.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.353
- Yes.
- Let's talk about it.

17:35.421 --> 17:36.718
How would you describe your style?

17:36.789 --> 17:39.622
Sometimes when I have
to go to special places,

17:39.691 --> 17:41.056
I have to wear dresses.

17:41.126 --> 17:43.060
But I don't wear them very often.

17:43.128 --> 17:45.323
I had to do it when I went to this wedding.

17:45.397 --> 17:46.591
You had to wear a dress?

17:46.665 --> 17:48.530
Yes, I did not like it.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.431
What... You don't feel like yourself in it?

17:50.502 --> 17:52.834
I don't like doing it because

17:53.072 --> 17:56.200
you always trip in them
sometimes when you run.

17:56.275 --> 17:58.800
And I have to run a lap every day,

17:58.877 --> 18:01.812
and I also don't like skirts.

18:01.880 --> 18:07.580
I heard that you changed
how they're running Legos.

18:07.653 --> 18:09.382
- Mmm, maybe.
- You didn't like that

18:09.455 --> 18:12.151
the girl Legos didn't do any actions.

18:12.224 --> 18:15.682
And so, you would take the heads off the girls
and you would put them on the guys' bodies.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.228
Uh, yes.

18:17.496 --> 18:21.057
And I heard that you wrote a letter,
and that they changed and made it

18:21.133 --> 18:23.693
so that the girl Legos do things.

18:23.769 --> 18:25.703
- Yes, I think so.
- That's pretty cool.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.671
Do you know that you're super cool?

18:27.739 --> 18:28.865
No.

18:29.374 --> 18:31.103
Well, I'm telling you, it's a fact.

18:34.713 --> 18:38.911
We are back with the
<i>Real Ladies of Inside Amy Schumer</i> reunion.

18:38.984 --> 18:40.747
Kim, how does it feel to see
your sister again?

18:40.819 --> 18:42.218
Is it weird?

18:46.425 --> 18:47.414
No.

18:47.493 --> 18:49.518
Amy, weird for you?

18:54.333 --> 18:56.665
- No.
- Well, can you at least explain

18:56.735 --> 18:58.202
what happened between the two of you?

18:58.270 --> 19:00.033
You used to be so close.

19:00.939 --> 19:02.463
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

19:02.641 --> 19:04.541
- What's up?
- That guy Bobby just texted me.

19:04.610 --> 19:07.374
The one who wouldn't hook up with you
'cause he said you look like his mom?

19:07.446 --> 19:10.142
No, no, no, Bobby's the one
I like really, really, really, really like.

19:10.215 --> 19:11.648
- What should I do?
- Just be yourself.

19:11.717 --> 19:12.706
<i>All right, love you.</i>

19:12.784 --> 19:14.149
Hello?

19:14.486 --> 19:16.977
Did Bobby Skeltis ever end up
letting you have sex with him?

19:17.055 --> 19:19.353
- Why? No.
- Laura just told me he has herpes.

19:19.424 --> 19:20.413
Oh.

19:20.492 --> 19:23.188
Oh, I have to jump,
my husband just drew me a bath.

19:23.262 --> 19:25.287
Okay, love you, bye... Hello?

19:25.364 --> 19:27.958
Kimberly! Did you let me
order a Russian Muppet

19:28.033 --> 19:29.159
when I was on Ambien?

19:29.234 --> 19:30.223
<i>Yeah, remember you said</i>

19:30.302 --> 19:31.599
you wanted to get your dick wet

19:31.670 --> 19:33.160
but you're too famous for Tinder now.

19:33.238 --> 19:36.002
- What should I do?
- Uh, I, I don't know. Look, I have to go.

19:36.074 --> 19:37.632
We're cuddling and watching <i>Splash.</i>

19:37.709 --> 19:39.506
Ooh, <i>Splash.</i> What channel?

19:39.945 --> 19:41.105
Hello?

19:45.551 --> 19:48.748
(SOBBING) I miss you so much.

19:49.221 --> 19:50.688
(SQUEAKY VOICE) I miss you so much.

19:50.756 --> 19:52.314
AMY: My whole family.

19:58.130 --> 19:59.461
- I miss you so much.
- I love you.

19:59.531 --> 20:02.295
- Come here.
- I miss you the most.

20:02.367 --> 20:03.561
Come here.

20:03.669 --> 20:05.102
It's so good to see you two make up.

20:05.170 --> 20:08.799
Wow, I think we worked through
some drama here tonight.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.739
Ladies, thank you so much.

20:10.809 --> 20:13.277
And thank you to everyone
watching at home or...

20:13.345 --> 20:14.676
Who are we kidding? On your phone

20:14.746 --> 20:16.907
while you're hiding in the bathroom
from your families.

20:16.982 --> 20:18.643
Have a great night. Thanks.

20:18.717 --> 20:21.049
AMY: Come here, come here.
KIM: I love you.

20:21.119 --> 20:22.313
ANDY: Thank you, ladies.

20:22.387 --> 20:24.082
- We love you, Andy.
- Thank you, ladies.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.281
Thank you.

20:25.357 --> 20:26.619
Andy, would you ever?

20:26.692 --> 20:27.716
- No.
- Okay.

20:27.793 --> 20:29.055
- As far as just...
- No.

20:32.197 --> 20:33.630
I'll give you a transition.

20:34.099 --> 20:36.158
Okay, I wanna change gears.

20:36.868 --> 20:38.130
That's a classic.

20:38.203 --> 20:39.727
(CREW LAUGHING)

20:40.772 --> 20:42.797
Why don't you put it in your food blog?

20:42.874 --> 20:44.535
- And then everyone can read about it.
- KIM: You know what?

20:44.610 --> 20:46.840
I will, thank you for that idea.
Thank you for that idea.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.539
Thank you, 'cause I will.

20:48.614 --> 20:49.911
- Okay, I will.
- Yeah.

20:53.218 --> 20:54.549
Congratulations on your food blog.

20:54.620 --> 20:57.145
Thank you, I worked really hard on it,
so thank you.

20:57.222 --> 20:59.554
Then maybe don't exploit your friendships

20:59.625 --> 21:01.525
and your family!

21:01.660 --> 21:03.059
WOMAN: <i>So easy.</i>

21:03.195 --> 21:04.423
MAN: <i>Mmm, magic.</i>

21:07.332 --> 21:08.390
(SCREAMING)

21:08.467 --> 21:09.559

21:09.635 --> 21:11.193
