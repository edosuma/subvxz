uh, 1488 to 1650...

04:58.539 --> 05:01.207

- Which were within feet of this,

05:01.292 --> 05:03.793
they were down to 88 to 91.

05:09.050 --> 05:11.134
- Yeah.

of the tunnel system and this

09:21.385 --> 09:23.720
It sounds like a-a copper alloy,

very interesting

09:25.231 --> 09:26.731

It's some type of copper alloy,
but unusual shape.

09:52.082 --> 09:55.335
Maybe it's got some kind
of decoration on it.

09:55.419 --> 09:58.838
<i>This is a very
interesting artifact.</i>

09:58.922 --> 10:00.015
I don't know what it is.

10:01.342 --> 10:03.259
<i>It's potentially copper.</i>

10:03.344 --> 10:06.271
<i>And this looks like
it's got a design on it.</i>

10:06.430 --> 10:11.017
<i>This is the type of find,
uh, that tells a lot,</i>

10:11.101 --> 10:14.270
<i>that someone else
was out in this same area</i>

10:14.355 --> 10:17.198
possibly looking for the hatch.

10:17.358 --> 10:20.360
- Well, it's too thin for a pot, like a cooking pot.
- Yeah.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.871
LAIRD:
It definitely curves up.

10:24.948 --> 10:28.126
- But definitely an interesting piece of metal.
- Mm-hmm.

10:28.210 --> 10:29.952
It could tell a story still
when it's cleaned up.

10:30.037 --> 10:31.454
It could.

10:31.538 --> 10:33.706
GARY: All right, mate,
let's tag it and bag it.

10:33.799 --> 10:36.301

<i>the possibly 16th century

11:07.416 --> 11:09.417
We've done a lot of work.
That's for sure.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.078
- It looks like a ton of work, honestly.
- Yeah.

11:12.171 --> 11:15.164
And you've found some scraps
of pottery but not here?

11:15.257 --> 11:17.092
- Not here yet.
- Mm-hmm.

11:18.094 --> 11:19.335
LIZ:
What you got?

11:19.428 --> 11:21.930
LAIRD:
I have a piece of pottery,

11:22.014 --> 11:23.932
but I think
it's really delicate.

11:24.016 --> 11:26.259
- Okay.
- This is definitely Mi'kmaq.

11:26.352 --> 11:28.594
<i>NARRATOR: Three
weeks ago, while searching</i>

11:48.290 --> 11:51.376

<i>of Community,

12:00.627 --> 12:02.554
So, this is for drilling.

12:02.638 --> 12:04.639
We have free range

12:04.724 --> 12:08.134
Any activity inside the green,

12:08.218 --> 12:10.395
I see. And the red?

12:10.554 --> 12:12.305
STEVE G.: Anything that
falls outside of the green,

12:12.398 --> 12:14.733
we need special permission
to be inside of the red.

12:14.892 --> 12:19.154
<i>NARRATOR: While the new regulations
do not apply to the Money Pit area,</i>

12:19.313 --> 12:22.064

ALEX:
What have you found out?

13:00.613 --> 13:01.946
What can you tell me?

13:02.105 --> 13:04.273
So, this unit,
we put in to try and see

13:04.366 --> 13:05.617
what was happening
with the stone road,

13:05.701 --> 13:07.443
because it seemed
to disappear here.

13:07.536 --> 13:09.278
So, then, just before lunch,

13:09.363 --> 13:11.280
we came down on a fairly level
layer of stone,

13:11.373 --> 13:13.032
- as you can see...
- Mm-hmm.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.293
And there's a large piece
of wood on the edge...

13:15.377 --> 13:17.119
- ALEX: Oh, yeah, right there.
- That lines up

13:17.204 --> 13:18.955
with the edge of the road

13:19.039 --> 13:21.123
- going towards the north.
- Wow.

13:21.208 --> 13:23.384
- This is almost exactly what we were looking for.
- LAIRD: Yeah.

13:23.544 --> 13:26.546
ALEX: Is it not? I mean, a large
piece of wood can be both carbon-dated

13:26.639 --> 13:29.307
and dendrochronology,
and it's part of the structure.

13:29.466 --> 13:30.466
- LAIRD: Yes.
- HELEN: Definitely.

13:30.551 --> 13:31.893
LAIRD:
It's actually

13:31.977 --> 13:33.302
almost more than we expected.

13:33.395 --> 13:35.638
- HELEN: It is more than we expected.
- Yeah.

13:35.731 --> 13:38.057
<i>MIRIAM: All along that we've
been working on the stone road,</i>

13:38.141 --> 13:40.235
<i>the real question was,
where is it going?</i>

13:40.319 --> 13:45.156
<i>And it definitely continues
out towards the beach.</i>

13:45.315 --> 13:47.408
And I think
that's important, um,

13:47.493 --> 13:50.078
in terms of kind of just
understanding its purpose.

13:50.162 --> 13:52.580
Anything on the other side,
or...?

13:52.739 --> 13:55.741
- Uh, we've only gone this far.
- Okay.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.243
If you look at
our-our permit application,

13:57.327 --> 13:59.170
that's what we're looking for.

13:59.255 --> 14:02.257
- Right.
- You know, artifacts or samples that we can date, so...

14:02.341 --> 14:04.083
ALEX:
We kind of have to take it,

14:04.176 --> 14:05.677
find out what it is,
and just cross our fingers

14:05.761 --> 14:07.178
that it's not gonna
shut us down.

14:07.263 --> 14:09.422
Yeah, pretty much.

14:09.506 --> 14:11.591
<i>MARTY: The archaeologists have
been a big part of our search</i>

14:11.684 --> 14:14.936
<i>these last few years,
and they're finding a lot,</i>

14:15.095 --> 14:16.679
<i>but the elephant in the swamp</i>

14:16.763 --> 14:19.599
<i>is, if we find
First Nations stuff,</i>

14:19.683 --> 14:21.442
what are the rules gonna be?

14:21.527 --> 14:23.436
And until we figure out
a path forward

14:23.529 --> 14:27.607
with this archaeological work,
um, it's a little hazy

14:27.691 --> 14:30.443
as to how much more
gets done on this island.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.787
LAIRD: So, we did a
trench in the center,

14:32.872 --> 14:35.698
and we got a nice large root
under the stone road...

14:35.782 --> 14:38.126
- Mm-hmm.
- So that's gone off for C-14.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.453
- Mm-hmm.
- That's gonna be the priority, I think.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.538
Right. You know, this is
kind of the biggest thing

14:42.631 --> 14:44.465
from last year that we found.

14:44.550 --> 14:47.385
- Yes.
- And I really hope that that comes back...

14:47.469 --> 14:50.379
- Yeah.
- Dating to kind of our zone of interest,

14:50.472 --> 14:54.058
- which is anything pre-1795.
- Fingers crossed.

14:54.217 --> 14:55.635
- HELEN: Yeah.
- Well, I'll leave you to it.

14:55.719 --> 14:57.228
- LAIRD: All right. Thanks, Alex.
- Thanks again.

14:57.313 --> 14:59.472

15:40.263 --> 15:43.015
You know, to me,
this is a big-can area.

15:43.100 --> 15:44.850

15:44.944 --> 15:47.103

15:52.776 --> 15:56.371
and aid us in putting the big
can down, uh, it'll be great.

15:56.455 --> 15:58.122
Yeah, we got wood
at the bottom again.

15:58.207 --> 15:59.448
- Yep.
- And here.

15:59.541 --> 16:01.459
STEVE G.:
I'm no pro,

16:01.543 --> 16:03.378
but I'd say we're scraping down
the side of something.

16:03.462 --> 16:08.290
Interestingly, we have wood
close to the bottom again.

16:08.384 --> 16:10.626
It scrapes along
the side of something.

16:10.711 --> 16:13.629
Yeah, wh-what you said, Steve,
you've got to start thinking,

16:13.714 --> 16:16.382
maybe you're, uh,
close to a vertical structure

16:16.475 --> 16:19.301
and you're bumping down
along the side of it.

16:19.395 --> 16:21.053
- BRENNAN: A lot of chips.
- STEVE G. Yeah.

16:21.138 --> 16:23.305
TERRY: A lot of chips, yeah.

16:23.390 --> 16:24.640
- That's almost round, isn't it?
- STEVE G.: Yeah.

16:26.068 --> 16:28.653
- BRENNAN: Could be just a knot or...
- CRAIG: A round piece?

16:28.812 --> 16:30.947
It-it has the appearance
of being round.

16:33.650 --> 16:35.243
ALEX:
Yeah, I think it's ax-cut.

16:37.904 --> 16:40.415
<i>So, out of the core,
we find a wood chip.</i>

16:40.574 --> 16:43.659
<i>And this wood chip has
kind of angled edges to it,</i>

16:43.744 --> 16:44.660
<i>which indicates ax-cut.</i>

16:44.745 --> 16:46.504
<i>An ax-cut,</i>

16:46.588 --> 16:50.091
to me, indicates the greater
potential that it's very old.

16:50.175 --> 16:51.426
CRAIG:
It's pretty amazing.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.586
Yeah, that's very interesting.

16:53.670 --> 16:56.088
Any hit of wood below
in situ material,

16:56.173 --> 16:57.423
that generally says chamber

16:57.507 --> 16:58.674
- or tunnel to me.
- Yeah.

16:58.759 --> 17:00.676
It's possibly veered over
into a chamber

17:00.769 --> 17:03.021
with stacked timbers
on the perimeter.

17:03.180 --> 17:04.847

- Here we go.
- What happened?

17:27.796 --> 17:30.289
- We hit some interesting things.
- Yes?

17:30.382 --> 17:33.459
We went into some wood
at about 83 feet below grade.

17:33.543 --> 17:35.470
We might have found a dowel.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.630
At the bottom of, uh,
our interesting intersection

17:37.723 --> 17:39.724
at 92 to 93 feet,

17:39.883 --> 17:43.394
we hit a beam about
six inches', I'd say, thickness.

17:43.479 --> 17:46.689
But we hit about ten feet
intersection of materials.

17:48.150 --> 17:49.650
ALEX:
The till above was pretty dense.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.736
It wasn't loose.
And then suddenly

17:51.820 --> 17:53.738
we hit wood,
then this stuff, and then

17:53.822 --> 17:56.649
we hit wood and we're out of it
and it's dense again.

17:56.733 --> 17:58.234
What if the ten-foot
sort of thing means

17:58.327 --> 18:00.244
it's coming up
to a great big chamber?

18:01.497 --> 18:02.663
That could be
your offset chamber.

18:02.823 --> 18:04.415
That's your offset chamber.

18:04.574 --> 18:05.416
ALEX: That's what
we were thinking, too.

18:07.669 --> 18:09.745
<i>MARTY: My leading
theory about the Money Pit</i>

18:09.838 --> 18:13.749
<i>is that there's
an offset chamber.</i>

18:13.834 --> 18:16.260
<i>If the Money Pit
was designed to go down</i>

18:16.419 --> 18:18.504
<i>and distract somebody
from a chamber</i>

18:18.588 --> 18:20.431
<i>that was actually
tunneled off to one side,</i>

18:20.590 --> 18:22.767
<i>which is what this
is kind of suggesting,</i>

18:22.851 --> 18:27.429
<i>then what you have is the
perfect hiding spot because,</i>

18:27.514 --> 18:29.524
in the thinking
of 100 or 200 years ago,

18:29.608 --> 18:31.684
no one else could
possibly ever find that.

18:31.777 --> 18:33.269
There would be no way.

18:33.362 --> 18:34.520
There'd be no surface
disturbance,

18:34.604 --> 18:36.280
there would be,
there would be nothing.

18:36.365 --> 18:41.035
Well, there's this rectangle
where we hit wood.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.286
TERRY:
It's about 18 by...

18:42.445 --> 18:44.789
by 12 feet.

18:44.948 --> 18:46.782
That would apply to a chamber,
too, wouldn't it?

18:46.867 --> 18:50.452
- It could apply to a chamber.
- Yeah.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.788
Here is a piece of wood
that, uh, Charles found.

18:52.881 --> 18:55.216
And it looks like
it might be rounded.

18:55.375 --> 18:56.884
Like it's the outer edge,

18:57.043 --> 19:00.471
which would give us a good date
of when the tree was cut down.

19:00.556 --> 19:04.884
Perhaps if this dates to be old,
maybe the-the original workings

19:04.968 --> 19:07.395
were constructed with dowels

19:07.554 --> 19:09.388
- instead of, like, spikes to put stuff together.
- MARTY: Oh, yeah.

19:09.472 --> 19:10.398
- You know?
- MARTY: Yeah.

19:10.557 --> 19:12.725
So that could be
part of a dowel.

19:12.809 --> 19:14.810
If this wood tests,

19:14.903 --> 19:19.407
you know, to that same
1488, whatever,

19:19.566 --> 19:22.493
- to 1650...
- That was at 90.5 feet,

19:22.578 --> 19:25.246
- so we're right in that area.
- Right there, right?

19:25.330 --> 19:25.997
- CRAIG: Yeah.
- The sweet spot.

19:27.490 --> 19:29.750
- Maybe you're coming up on something.
- Yes.

19:29.910 --> 19:32.587
RICK: Okay, the next step,
I think what we need to do

19:32.671 --> 19:35.748
is we'll take this
to 150, 150-ish.

19:35.841 --> 19:37.917
Unless you find confirmation
of something on this hole,

19:38.001 --> 19:40.586
we'll probably do
another in this area.

19:40.670 --> 19:42.254
MARTY:
All right, we have a plan.

19:42.347 --> 19:43.472
TERRY:
Hear, hear.

I love this rainy weather.

19:56.862 --> 20:00.356
<i>Jack Begley and metal
detection expert Gary Drayton</i>

20:05.787 --> 20:07.947
<i>or possible tunnel entrance.</i>

20:08.040 --> 20:10.866
Okay, mate. That's another
section of the transect.

20:10.951 --> 20:13.619
So, we'll just continue
this one through, mate.

20:13.703 --> 20:15.296
- JACK: Mm-hmm.
- (beeping)

20:17.791 --> 20:20.885
GARY: That's a heck of a
good start to this section.

20:20.969 --> 20:24.305
I'm getting iron grunts,
but you never know, mate.

20:24.464 --> 20:26.557
That's gonna be tough digging.
It's right on top of the stump.

20:30.896 --> 20:33.564
Pit bull on a T-bone
whenever I get a signal, mate,

20:33.649 --> 20:35.566
- aren't you?
- No, that was a lot easier

20:35.651 --> 20:36.734
digging than
what I thought it was.

20:36.818 --> 20:38.569
I think it might be out.

20:38.654 --> 20:40.321
It's an old stump.

20:42.399 --> 20:44.492
(beeping)

20:44.651 --> 20:45.826
GARY:
A little scratchy signal.

20:45.986 --> 20:47.828
- My guess is iron.
- (beeping)

20:47.988 --> 20:49.905
Is it in the stump or under it?

20:49.998 --> 20:53.409
Because it could be
really old, then.

20:53.493 --> 20:56.161
I think it was under the stump.

20:56.246 --> 20:59.924
- What have we got here? Ooh, an old buckle.
- What the heck is that?

21:00.008 --> 21:03.669
A buckle on a leather strap,
by the look of it.

21:03.762 --> 21:06.430
- JACK: It still has the leather attached to it.
- Yeah.

21:06.515 --> 21:08.516
(clears throat)
So, that will be interesting.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.936
We don't find that much leather
on the island, do we?

21:12.095 --> 21:14.596
No, and that buckle
does look kind of old.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.440
Yeah, it does look old, mate.

21:16.599 --> 21:19.026
<i>NARRATOR: A leather
strap and metal buckle?</i>

21:19.185 --> 21:22.021
<i>Might they have belonged
to someone who lived and farmed</i>

21:22.114 --> 21:26.859
<i>on the island after the
Money Pit's discovery in 1795?</i>

21:26.943 --> 21:29.704
<i>Or could they prove
to be much older</i>

21:29.788 --> 21:31.038
<i>and provide important clues</i>

21:31.123 --> 21:33.782
<i>connected
to the treasure mystery?</i>

21:33.867 --> 21:36.702
What type of thing would
a-a strap like this be used for,

21:36.786 --> 21:37.953
based upon the size?

21:38.038 --> 21:41.540
Normally, like a sling,

21:41.624 --> 21:44.710
like a belt that goes over,
and you would have had the pouch

21:44.794 --> 21:46.804
if you-- say, if you was
out here hunting...

21:46.963 --> 21:49.465
- For musket balls.
- Yeah, might have had musket balls

21:49.549 --> 21:52.051
or flint for a flintlock.

21:52.144 --> 21:56.889
But, also, uh, back in the day,
they used to keep coins

21:56.982 --> 22:02.561
in little money pouches,
uh, kind of like, um, satchels.

22:02.645 --> 22:03.979
(chuckles)
I like to think it is,

22:04.064 --> 22:05.898
because if their coin purse
strap broke,

22:05.991 --> 22:08.067
- maybe they dropped some coins around here.
- Exactly.

22:08.151 --> 22:10.069
I like the way you think, Jack.

22:10.162 --> 22:11.912
JACK: Hopefully, there are
some other finds around here

22:11.997 --> 22:15.666
that help pin down the date,
maybe a button or a coin.

22:15.751 --> 22:17.752
Oh, that would be
fantastic, mate.

22:17.836 --> 22:19.995
<i>We've recovered some really,</i>

22:20.080 --> 22:23.665
really interesting artifacts
on this lot.

22:23.750 --> 22:26.927
<i>If we could find the hatch
location, that would be huge.</i>

22:27.012 --> 22:30.089
<i>Is it a back entrance
to the Money Pit</i>

22:30.173 --> 22:33.759
or is it a possible vault
full of treasure?

22:33.843 --> 22:35.094
We will keep going.

22:35.178 --> 22:36.937
<i>So, it's gonna be
interesting to see</i>

22:37.097 --> 22:40.024
<i>what went on in this area.</i>

22:48.358 --> 22:49.533
(beeping)

22:51.277 --> 22:54.446
That. We have winkled
that signal out, mate.

22:54.531 --> 22:56.040
That is interesting.

22:56.124 --> 22:58.793
That stands out.
Just there, mate.

22:58.952 --> 23:00.461
Dig that sucker up.

23:03.873 --> 23:06.050
We're overdue a coin, Jack.

23:06.134 --> 23:08.886
I'd love to find
a coin right now.

23:09.045 --> 23:12.548
All right,
let's see if I got it out.

23:12.632 --> 23:13.974
(rapid beeping)

23:14.059 --> 23:17.561
Good. Ah, mate, pinpointer time.

23:17.720 --> 23:19.471

23:19.556 --> 23:21.723
Oh, it's down there.

23:21.808 --> 23:22.891

- (quietly): Yeah.

23:27.147 --> 23:29.064
GARY:
Come on, baby.

23:29.149 --> 23:31.817
It is in my hand.

23:31.901 --> 23:33.735
Give me a coin or a button.

23:33.820 --> 23:34.995
[both gasp]

23:35.080 --> 23:37.540
- JACK: Yes!
- GARY: Look at that roundness.

23:39.993 --> 23:42.661
GARY:
It's a button.

23:42.745 --> 23:44.746
I mean, look at that, mate.

23:44.831 --> 23:48.083
That is a bobby-dazzler
of a button.

23:48.168 --> 23:49.835
Look at the patina on it.

23:49.928 --> 23:52.254
It's an old button, for sure,

23:52.338 --> 23:55.757
because, look, it's a single
loop, by the look of it.

23:55.842 --> 23:57.092
- JACK: Yeah?
- GARY: It might have the manufacturer

23:57.185 --> 23:59.178
or the maker's name on it.

23:59.271 --> 24:02.431
- We might be able to pull a date or some info off this?
- Yeah.

24:02.524 --> 24:05.017
And that is an old
jacket button.

24:05.110 --> 24:06.277
Oh...

24:08.938 --> 24:11.690
<i>NARRATOR:

clean up really, really nice.

24:42.814 --> 24:45.065
Could be copper alloy.

24:45.150 --> 24:48.227
- Could be pewter. Could be silver.
- Oh, yeah.

24:48.311 --> 24:49.978
This is in such good condition.

24:50.071 --> 24:53.157
I know Kelly is gonna do
a really good job

24:53.241 --> 24:55.901
- cleaning this up.
- Yeah. Yeah.

24:55.985 --> 24:57.986
Especially if we get
some designs

24:58.071 --> 25:00.072
off this and we can date it.

JACK: This is the type
of thing we were hoping

25:02.000 --> 25:03.584
- to find out here, Gary.
- Yeah.

- Yep.

<i>with archaeologists Laird Niven,

25:52.717 --> 25:55.544
<i>Miriam Amirault,
and other members of the team.</i>

25:55.637 --> 25:57.212
You know,
we're a little confused

25:57.305 --> 25:58.880
about what we can
and can't do on the island.

25:58.965 --> 26:01.225
- Yeah.
- We felt like,

26:01.384 --> 26:03.969
to date,
we've done everything right.

26:04.062 --> 26:07.147
- Yep.
- But if you get back and look down at the island,

26:07.232 --> 26:09.641
you know, there are these spots
where, to me,

26:09.726 --> 26:11.068
it's getting bigger and bigger
and what we can do

26:11.152 --> 26:12.561
becomes less and less.

26:12.645 --> 26:13.988
Yep.

26:14.147 --> 26:16.073
MARTY:
So, we have internally

26:16.157 --> 26:18.867
made a decision...

26:21.246 --> 26:23.163
to back down
on archaeological methods

26:23.248 --> 26:24.489
for the time being...

26:24.574 --> 26:26.000
Mm-hmm.

26:26.159 --> 26:29.086
And let the dust settle on this.

26:32.424 --> 26:35.667
<i>With the regulations
being unclear,</i>

26:35.752 --> 26:38.095
and what's gonna happen to us
being unclear

26:38.179 --> 26:43.767
when we discover things, we have
a very large disincentive

26:43.852 --> 26:47.262
to find any more artifacts
that might cause us

26:47.347 --> 26:49.431
to lose the right
to explore on our island.

26:49.515 --> 26:52.434
<i>We have to think twice before
we send the archaeologists</i>

26:52.518 --> 26:54.936
<i>into another area,
because if they find something</i>

26:55.021 --> 26:57.773
<i>that could lead that area
to become off-limits,</i>

26:57.866 --> 27:00.192
<i>it's a scary thought to us.</i>

27:00.285 --> 27:02.277
This is a treasure hunt.

27:02.370 --> 27:03.621
It's trying
to unravel a mystery.

27:03.705 --> 27:06.782
It is not solely dedicated

27:06.875 --> 27:08.792
to an archaeological
understanding

27:08.951 --> 27:12.954
<i>of what has transpired
on Oak Island over centuries.</i>

27:13.048 --> 27:14.790
<i>And there are
other methodologies</i>

27:14.874 --> 27:19.219
<i>that can be applied
that are much less restrictive.</i>

27:19.379 --> 27:22.890
<i>MARTY: We think it's best
to not do archaeological work</i>

27:23.049 --> 27:25.300
<i>at this point, to shut it down,</i>

27:25.393 --> 27:27.219
because until
we understand the rules

27:27.303 --> 27:29.063
and what we might be giving up,

27:29.147 --> 27:32.557
uh, that seems to be
most prudent.

27:32.642 --> 27:37.312
There's absolute recognition of
the skill set that you brought.

27:37.397 --> 27:39.398
I mean, there are all kinds
of things discovered

27:39.482 --> 27:40.741
that we wouldn't
have discovered.

27:40.900 --> 27:42.826
- Yeah, sorry about that.
- No, no.

27:42.985 --> 27:44.236
- (laughter)
- Well, if-if-- You know what?

27:44.320 --> 27:46.246
If the unintended consequences
weren't there,

27:46.331 --> 27:48.073
we'd be delighted about that.

27:48.166 --> 27:49.658
- You know? I mean...
- Absolutely. Yes, and we should be.

27:49.751 --> 27:51.993
Yes. Yeah,
that's the weird thing.

27:52.078 --> 27:54.088
- Yeah.
- In the meantime,

27:54.247 --> 27:56.164
we're gonna stay
with the search,

27:56.257 --> 27:58.092
but we don't want to do...

27:58.251 --> 27:59.760
(laughs): we don't want
to shoot ourselves in the foot.

27:59.844 --> 28:02.087
Yeah. I think you're doing
the right thing.

28:02.171 --> 28:03.263
For sure.

28:03.423 --> 28:05.432
<i>When I came on five years ago,</i>

28:05.517 --> 28:09.853
to make sure that someone was
here, uh, to protect, uh, sites

28:09.938 --> 28:12.264
and to identify artifacts.

28:12.357 --> 28:15.267
And every year we've been
improving that process.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.861
<i>And through that, we're
discovering more and more.</i>

28:18.020 --> 28:20.355
<i>And the problem
in the owners' minds</i>

28:20.440 --> 28:24.443
<i>is that it seems like
the more we do to comply,</i>

28:24.536 --> 28:26.945
<i>the stricter things get
and the more things change</i>

28:27.038 --> 28:30.958
and more control they have
over their resources, uh,

28:31.042 --> 28:33.210
is being lost.

28:33.294 --> 28:36.288
<i>NARRATOR: Although Laird Niven
will remain full-time on the island</i>

28:48.727 --> 28:50.385
For all of the archaeologists,

28:50.470 --> 28:52.554
I think we're
a little disappointed

28:52.638 --> 28:54.481
<i>that we can't get
a lot more done,</i>

28:54.566 --> 28:57.234
<i>but I completely understand</i>

28:57.318 --> 28:59.144
<i>Marty and Rick
and Craig's decision</i>

28:59.228 --> 29:01.905
<i>to kind of focus more
on the treasure story</i>

29:02.064 --> 29:04.399
<i>and less so about just
the general archaeology</i>

29:04.484 --> 29:06.326
<i>of the island.</i>

29:06.411 --> 29:08.328
So, I think they need to do
what's best for them,

29:10.415 --> 29:13.751
You know, h-here's
my thoughts: number one,

29:13.910 --> 29:17.245
we have, uh, gratitude
for all of your hard work,

29:17.338 --> 29:21.842
your efforts, your commitment,
and it's only through discourse

29:22.001 --> 29:23.844
and dialogue
that you problem-solve,

29:23.928 --> 29:27.347
and my hope is that we can
continue on that agenda.

29:27.432 --> 29:30.008
- Mm-hmm. Absolutely.
- MARTY: Okay.

29:30.101 --> 29:32.844
- I think we're all on the same page.
- Yep. We are.

29:32.929 --> 29:34.188
Uh, much appreciation
all around the table.

29:34.272 --> 29:36.264
Um, I-I say we get back at it.

29:36.357 --> 29:37.933
- I say yes.
- Okay. - All right.

on our finds, mate.

29:51.623 --> 29:55.209

30:06.295 --> 30:08.055
Well, we're really interested
in that button

30:08.214 --> 30:09.473
that we recovered on Lot 4.

30:09.632 --> 30:10.882
Have you had a chance to look
at that yet?

30:10.967 --> 30:12.968
I haven't had a chance yet.

30:13.052 --> 30:14.719
It's right here,
but let's have a look at it.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.304
Sweet.

30:16.397 --> 30:19.233
- It's an interesting button.
- Yeah.

30:19.392 --> 30:21.226
- Look at the condition of that. That's nice.
- Yeah, that's not bad.

30:21.319 --> 30:23.061
- GARY: Hmm.
- Yeah.

30:23.154 --> 30:25.897
The most interesting thing
about this find

30:25.990 --> 30:31.236
is it comes from Lot 4, where
potentially the hatch could be.

30:31.329 --> 30:32.988
JACK: It's an area that,
historically, we really don't

30:33.081 --> 30:35.249
have any recorded work
over there.

30:35.333 --> 30:38.919
KELLY: Sure. Well under
those conditions, Gary,

30:39.003 --> 30:40.328
I think probably
what we should do

30:40.413 --> 30:42.339
is do an XRF test on it first--

30:42.498 --> 30:44.916
Before we clean it--
Because if there's any,

30:45.009 --> 30:47.168
you know, precious metals
in the soil itself,

30:47.253 --> 30:49.170
then that's when
you want to test it.

30:49.255 --> 30:50.931
- GARY: You never know, mate.
- You never know.

30:51.015 --> 30:52.424
So let's give it a try. Okay?

30:52.508 --> 30:54.509
Okay, mate.
Looking forward to this.

Definitely. And silver, Gary.

31:44.060 --> 31:45.644
You know, how does that happen?

31:45.737 --> 31:47.571
KELLY: If it's a gold-plated
button, for instance,

31:47.730 --> 31:49.990
that would be the gold,
perhaps, on it.

31:50.149 --> 31:51.658
Or it comes from the soil

31:51.743 --> 31:55.579
or part of the composition
of the, of the metal itself.

31:55.738 --> 32:00.417
This is, to me, is pretty
unique, what we see here.

32:00.576 --> 32:02.410
And you've seen a lot
of things on the island.

32:02.503 --> 32:04.087
For you to say it's unique,
that's fantastic.

32:04.172 --> 32:05.330
This is different.

32:05.423 --> 32:08.166
This is quite different, yeah.

32:08.259 --> 32:11.419
What type of person would wear
a gold and silver gilded button?

32:11.504 --> 32:14.014
It's an officer, perhaps.

32:14.173 --> 32:16.007
- If it's a military button.
- Yeah, uh, British military,

32:16.092 --> 32:18.268
for instance. Sure.

32:18.353 --> 32:21.429
So, what's an officer doing
all the way over on Lot 4?

32:21.522 --> 32:22.940
Probably looking
for the same thing

32:23.024 --> 32:25.350

the hatch.

32:25.434 --> 32:26.518

- Find some more.

- No.

32:29.105 --> 32:31.272

33:32.427 --> 33:34.502
and possibly
incredibly significant

33:34.595 --> 33:37.756
to what we're doing,
it was a lot of hard work.

<i>because any type
of archaeologically-driven work</i>

a negative impact on the search.</i>

34:21.809 --> 34:25.062
<i>And many of the discoveries
that we have made</i>

34:25.221 --> 34:27.472
<i>were driven by
the archaeological process</i>

a little frustrated

34:44.332 --> 34:46.666
that the process
that got us to this point

34:46.751 --> 34:50.087
is the same thing that basically
precluded us from continuing.

So, one of our projects

36:38.779 --> 36:41.189
this year was
to have a crosscut,

36:41.273 --> 36:43.450
bisecting the stone road.

36:43.609 --> 36:45.860
And the aim of the crosscut was

36:45.953 --> 36:48.955
to get, preferably,
datable artifacts

36:49.040 --> 36:51.199
or datable samples that we could

36:51.283 --> 36:54.711
- either do dendro on or C-14 on.
- Right.

36:54.870 --> 36:58.706
And luckily, we found
a nice root, a large root

36:58.799 --> 37:01.709
growing directly
under the stone road,

37:01.794 --> 37:03.303
and so that's what this is.

37:03.462 --> 37:06.640
We sent, uh, carbon 14 samples,

37:06.799 --> 37:08.892
and that's the data that, uh,
Craig's gonna present.

Okay, but what does
that mean to the road?

38:14.283 --> 38:17.460
To us, it meant
that the root was there

38:17.545 --> 38:19.287
when the road was built
on top of it.

38:19.371 --> 38:21.965

- Yeah, yeah, I-I agree.

38:24.385 --> 38:26.294

uh, shortly beforehand.

38:30.308 --> 38:33.059
Could I say
contemporaneous almost

38:33.218 --> 38:34.894
with original construction?

38:34.979 --> 38:38.306
Add a few...
40 or 50 years maybe.

38:38.399 --> 38:41.901
It actually fits in very,
very well with the dates

38:41.986 --> 38:43.895
that we got for some of the
stakes along the cobble path.

38:43.988 --> 38:47.315
MARTY: The bulk of the
evidence supports quite a ways

38:47.408 --> 38:50.910
prior to conventional discovery
of the Money Pit.

38:50.995 --> 38:52.236
Right.

38:53.414 --> 38:55.415
<i>NARRATOR: Is it possible
that with the discovery</i>

38:55.574 --> 38:59.002
<i>of this tree root beneath
the stone wharf in the swamp,</i>

38:59.086 --> 39:02.163
<i>that the team has now
found hard evidence</i>

39:02.247 --> 39:05.166
<i>that this feature, along
with the cobblestone path</i>

39:05.250 --> 39:08.419
<i>leading out of the swamp
and the Money Pit itself,</i>

39:08.512 --> 39:11.172
<i>were all constructed
at the same time?</i>

39:12.433 --> 39:16.436
IAN: There is a narrative here
of people depositing things,

39:16.595 --> 39:18.596
and we have the threads

39:18.680 --> 39:23.360
that tie, you know, a massive
undertaking at the Money Pit

39:23.519 --> 39:26.437
and the stone road construction,
so, to me, that's...

39:26.530 --> 39:29.107
that's a big deal.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.274
Yeah.

39:30.359 --> 39:32.369
<i>MARTY:
We have lots of dates</i>

39:32.453 --> 39:34.862
<i>that seem to be focusing
on mid-1600s,</i>

39:34.947 --> 39:37.532
<i>going back to the 1400s.</i>

39:37.616 --> 39:40.293
You know, timbers used
back in the day were probably

39:40.378 --> 39:42.453
hundred-year-old trees anyway.

39:42.546 --> 39:45.382
That brings us
to maybe 1750 as a maximum.

39:45.466 --> 39:47.542
That's good stuff.

39:47.635 --> 39:50.878
This road seems to be...
have intrigued everybody.

39:50.971 --> 39:53.640
- Yup.
- RICK: I'd like to hope that

39:53.724 --> 39:55.883
the powers that be,
the regulatory powers,

39:55.968 --> 39:57.635
will accede to our wishes,

39:57.728 --> 40:00.221
and we can perhaps do
a little more investigation.

40:00.305 --> 40:02.816
There's a lot of hope
to figuring this one out.

40:02.900 --> 40:05.226
<i>I've always believed</i>

40:05.319 --> 40:08.980
that what happened here
was long ago.

40:09.064 --> 40:13.910
<i>And by long ago,
I mean 1400s, 1500s.</i>

40:14.069 --> 40:17.405
<i>So my thought is
that the swamp work,</i>

40:17.489 --> 40:20.575
<i>with similar dates
as in the Money Pit--</i>

40:20.659 --> 40:24.337
<i>It's hard to say that they're
not connected in some way.</i>

40:25.506 --> 40:29.333
Based on the data
presented today,

40:29.427 --> 40:33.671
this road looks to be quite old
indeed, and that is exciting.

40:33.764 --> 40:37.434
So, upon that, I think
we disperse back to our jobs

40:37.518 --> 40:40.520
and, uh, see what other data
we can bring to the table.

40:40.604 --> 40:42.346
And we got a whole Money Pit
to dig. Right, Billy?

40:42.440 --> 40:43.857
- Mm-hmm.
- Let's go.

40:45.109 --> 40:48.603
<i>NARRATOR: Rick,
Marty, Craig and their team</i>

40:48.687 --> 40:52.115
<i>operate by a simple mantra:</i>
sempre avanti.

40:52.274 --> 40:54.617
<i>"Always forward."</i>

40:54.776 --> 40:57.620
<i>Even though valuable clues
may lie hidden</i>

40:57.705 --> 41:00.531
<i>where they are currently
not allowed to search,</i>

41:00.624 --> 41:03.376
<i>their will to keep scanning,</i>

41:03.461 --> 41:07.538
<i>digging and drilling
across the island</i>

41:07.623 --> 41:11.384
<i>suggests that the answers
to a 226-year-old mystery</i>

41:11.543 --> 41:14.053
<i>are still within their reach.</i>

41:14.213 --> 41:18.382
<i>And as they continue working
toward a potential discovery</i>

41:18.467 --> 41:22.562
<i>that has eluded determined
men and women since 1795,</i>

41:22.721 --> 41:25.973
<i>one thing is for sure.</i>

41:26.058 --> 41:28.318
<i>Nothing can break their will.</i>

41:31.647 --> 41:34.565
<i>Next time on</i>
The Curse of Oak Island...

41:34.658 --> 41:37.076
-(horn tooting) -ALEX: Look
at that! That's really something.

41:37.161 --> 41:38.828
- (laughs) - That
excavator looks really big.

41:38.913 --> 41:41.664
<i>RICK: If there is a ship there,
then I want to see the evidence.</i>

41:41.823 --> 41:43.491
That piece of bell metal
might be associated

41:43.584 --> 41:45.660
- with Portuguese.
- CHRISTA: The tin--

41:45.744 --> 41:48.579
It's been used
in the production of cannons.

41:48.672 --> 41:51.424
Ooh! Look at that.
That is bloody cool, mate.

41:51.509 --> 41:54.418
You would use a tool like this
for smoothing timbers.

41:54.512 --> 41:56.003
To sync a shaft.

41:56.096 --> 41:58.256
Wow! Seems to me,
it's a shaft wall.

41:58.340 --> 42:00.007
I can't explain it.
