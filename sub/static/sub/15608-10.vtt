I know! This is the most
exciting thing to happen

00:24.145 --> 00:27.568

If anybody needs me,
I'll be out picking up food

00:46.167 --> 00:48.259
Let me guess,
because of the fog,

00:48.259 --> 00:51.382
the highway will become
roadkill buffet?

00:51.382 --> 00:53.594
No, wise guy,
because of the fog,

00:53.594 --> 00:57.518
the cops can't see me
dumpster diving behind
Julio's Dim Sum Palace.

00:57.518 --> 01:00.311
(LAUGHING)

01:00.311 --> 01:04.024
Well, that would explain
why there were rats
in last week's Chinese food.

So that's why

02:04.955 --> 02:06.957
and gravimetric hygrometer
in the fog.

02:06.957 --> 02:08.299
I also took a pee-pee.

02:10.010 --> 02:12.132
Ravi, we talked
about oversharing.

02:13.884 --> 02:15.556
Hey, guys.
Since we're fogged in,

02:15.556 --> 02:18.138
we're all going to
"Pin the Tail on the Donkey."

02:18.138 --> 02:20.100
That game seems
a bit juvenile.

02:20.100 --> 02:21.472
Oh, it's not a game.

02:21.472 --> 02:24.144
Our donkey, Julia,
lost her tail
in a tractor accident.

02:26.357 --> 02:28.189
Look, this macrame tail
we made for her

02:28.189 --> 02:31.232
is really gonna make her
feel whole again.

02:31.232 --> 02:34.985
Whoa! I just checked
the chemical composition
of the fog.

02:34.985 --> 02:37.948
The domoic acid level
is off the charts!

02:37.948 --> 02:39.200
Lou, do you speak Tiffany?

02:39.200 --> 02:40.991
Sorry, science isn't
my thing.

02:40.991 --> 02:42.833
My high school
only offered two subjects,

02:42.833 --> 02:44.205
Plow Repair
and Horse Whisperin'.

02:46.287 --> 02:49.340
Domoic acid
is a debilitating neurotoxin.

02:49.340 --> 02:51.212
If it makes its way
into our blood streams,

02:51.212 --> 02:54.555
it will cause the cells
in our brains to degenerate.

02:54.555 --> 02:58.299
I'm just hearing
a lot of blah-blah-blah.

02:58.299 --> 03:01.852
Obviously, brain cell
degeneration wouldn't have
much effect on you,

03:01.852 --> 03:04.305
but for the rest of us,
it would be deleterious!

03:05.606 --> 03:08.649
Bad.

03:08.649 --> 03:11.612
But how could such
a dangerous chemical
make its way into a fog?

03:11.612 --> 03:15.946
Domoic acid is a by-product
of algae, which our lake
is filled with.

03:15.946 --> 03:19.660
(SIGHS) The acid must have
evaporated with the water
when the fog formed,

03:19.660 --> 03:22.743
creating this dangerous
toxic colloid!

03:22.743 --> 03:25.085
So, that's a "no"
on Pin the Tail
on the Donkey?

03:26.377 --> 03:29.330
This fog is making
my skin so moist!

03:29.330 --> 03:31.632
It hasn't been this vibrant
since I went to Namibia

03:31.632 --> 03:33.424
for that rhinoceros
milk facial!

03:33.424 --> 03:36.467
Emma, how long
were you out there?

03:36.467 --> 03:38.299
In Namibia?
Just a day.

03:38.299 --> 03:40.220
I had the facial,
bought a diamond mine,

03:40.220 --> 03:42.723
then hopped back
on Daddy's G6.

03:42.723 --> 03:45.726
Ravi meant,
how long were you
in the fog?

03:45.726 --> 03:47.728
Oh, just an hour or so.

03:47.728 --> 03:50.851
(WINCES) Wow, I'm starting
to get a headache.

03:50.851 --> 03:55.446
That could be a symptom
that domoic acid has invaded
your cerebral cortex.

03:55.446 --> 03:57.778
On the bright side,
her skin really does
look great.

03:58.319 --> 03:59.820
Aw.

04:03.994 --> 04:06.246
How long will
Emma's headache last?

04:06.246 --> 04:07.458
Hard to say.

04:07.458 --> 04:09.500
Depending on her exposure
to the domoic acid,

04:09.500 --> 04:11.542
the damage to her brain
could be permanent.

04:11.542 --> 04:14.335
(GASPS)
Forget about my brain,

04:14.335 --> 04:16.507
that acid won't damage
my hair color, will it?

04:18.178 --> 04:21.342
Emma, this could affect you
for the rest of your life.

04:21.342 --> 04:22.723
This is serious!

04:22.723 --> 04:23.974
Just because
she has a headache

04:23.974 --> 04:25.976
doesn't necessarily mean
the fog is toxic.

04:25.976 --> 04:28.309
Um, Lou,
the science is indisputable.

04:28.309 --> 04:31.482
Oh, please, science is wrong
all the darn time.
For example...

04:31.482 --> 04:33.314
Hold your cowboy hats.

04:33.314 --> 04:35.946
It's about to get country
in here.

04:35.946 --> 04:38.399
The Meckel-Serres Conception
of Recapitulation Law

04:38.399 --> 04:40.781
was totally disproven
by modern bio-geneticists.

04:41.572 --> 04:43.864
That's... True.

04:45.326 --> 04:47.538
How the heck
did you know that?

04:47.538 --> 04:50.541
Professor Clyde covered it
in Horse Whisperin'.

04:50.541 --> 04:53.504
(WINCES)
Ow, I have a headache.

04:53.504 --> 04:55.125
You already told us.

04:55.125 --> 04:58.048
Told you what?
That you have headache!

04:58.048 --> 05:00.511
Whoa, spooky!
How did you know that?

05:02.012 --> 05:04.885
Oh, no! The neurotoxin
must be causing Emma

05:04.885 --> 05:06.727
to suffer short-term
memory loss.

05:06.727 --> 05:10.190
(SCOFFS) I have not lost
my memory!

05:10.190 --> 05:11.602
Did I mention
I have a headache?

05:16.397 --> 05:18.779
Xander, aren't you worried
about the fog?

05:18.779 --> 05:21.111
Tiffany and Ravi think
it's dangerous.

05:21.111 --> 05:23.364
They also thought there were
rats in the spring rolls,

05:23.364 --> 05:25.115
but those things
were delicious.

05:26.907 --> 05:29.289
Guys, I have a headache,
like Emma.

05:29.289 --> 05:32.413
Didn't you say you were out
in the fog earlier?

05:32.413 --> 05:34.505
Yes, I'm afraid
the domoic acid

05:34.505 --> 05:37.087
has penetrated the neurons
in my brain.

05:37.087 --> 05:38.509
Headaches can be caused
by lots of things,

05:38.509 --> 05:40.090
including this conversation.

05:41.382 --> 05:43.764
Yo, son!
Who you think
you callin' out?

05:43.764 --> 05:45.135
(CHUCKLING)
What are you doing, Ravi?

05:45.135 --> 05:46.807
The name's R-Money!

05:46.807 --> 05:48.559
Don't makes me brings
da ruckus!

05:50.391 --> 05:53.023
The fog must have
scrambled his brain.

05:53.023 --> 05:54.935
Hilarious,
but I'm not buying it.

05:54.935 --> 05:58.779
(SCOFFING) I don't need
y'all sweating me.

05:58.779 --> 06:00.571
I'm ghost.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.748
You know what, guys?
I have a...
BOTH: We know!

06:07.748 --> 06:08.789
(SCOFFS) Rude.

06:10.911 --> 06:13.624
We need to get Emma help.

06:13.624 --> 06:18.298
Yo, it's your boy, R-Money!
Believe dat!

06:18.879 --> 06:20.631
Oh. Hi, Ravi.

06:20.631 --> 06:23.133
I be R-Money.
Don't get it twisted.

06:23.133 --> 06:26.927
R-Money, the hardest
gangsta in pleated shorts
and sandals.

06:29.139 --> 06:31.391
Why is Ravi
talking like that?

06:31.391 --> 06:34.475
He must be in a fugue state.
This is alarming!

06:34.475 --> 06:37.147
The domoic acid clearly
has a detrimental effect

06:37.147 --> 06:39.610
on the neurological function
of the frontal lobe.

06:39.610 --> 06:41.822
English, Tiffany.
English.

06:41.822 --> 06:43.944
(SIGHS) It gave Emma amnesia.

06:43.944 --> 06:47.077
While in Ravi,
it's affecting his sense
of personal identity.

06:47.077 --> 06:49.029
Hi, Ravi!
When did you get here?

06:49.029 --> 06:52.953
Girl, you just saw me
stroll up in this piece.

06:52.953 --> 06:54.875
Oh, hi, Ravi!
When did you get here?

06:54.875 --> 06:56.376
Okay, yo,
what's with shorty?

06:56.376 --> 06:59.630
She's straight trippin',
nah-I-mean?

06:59.630 --> 07:01.632
No, we don't
"nah-you-mean."

07:05.005 --> 07:07.137
I can't believe
this is really happening.

07:07.137 --> 07:08.639
We need to get help.

07:08.639 --> 07:11.351
We have to find Murphy,
so he can drive them
to a hospital.

07:11.351 --> 07:13.433
I'll go tell Xander
what's going on.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.687
Remember, when you go
into the fog, be sure
to hold your breath.

07:16.687 --> 07:18.398
You don't want to end up
like Emma and Ravi.

07:20.150 --> 07:21.321
Like me?

07:21.321 --> 07:23.774
Please, ain't no one
got swag like R-Money.

07:23.774 --> 07:25.526
I know you feel it,
baby girl.

07:27.778 --> 07:28.829
Get out of my cabin.

07:31.782 --> 07:33.163
(BOTH INHALE DEEPLY)

07:35.996 --> 07:37.498
Where is Murphy?

07:37.498 --> 07:38.959
(COUGHS) S'up, Boo?

07:38.959 --> 07:42.963
You lookin' nice enough
to be my ride or die.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.675
Tiffany, we need to get
Ravi an ambulance.

07:44.675 --> 07:45.926
Is he getting worse?

07:45.926 --> 07:47.007
He's about to,
if he keeps it up.

07:48.639 --> 07:49.890
What's going on?

07:49.890 --> 07:51.642
Zuri told me to get here
as fast as I could.

07:51.642 --> 07:53.263
Oh, hi, Xander!

07:53.263 --> 07:54.474
Oh, your shirt's missing

07:55.225 --> 07:56.356
Okay.

07:57.187 --> 07:58.689
Hi, Xander!

07:58.689 --> 08:01.732
Your shirt's missing

08:01.732 --> 08:05.275
The neurotoxin in the fog
has compromised Emma's
short-term memory.

08:05.275 --> 08:08.028
Homegirl done lost her mind.
(CHUCKLES)

08:08.028 --> 08:10.911
For reals.

08:10.911 --> 08:14.204
I see R-Money
is still in the house.

08:14.204 --> 08:16.917
Xander, Emma
and Ravi's brains
really are messed up.

08:16.917 --> 08:18.999
So is yours,
if you believe them.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.581
They're pranking us.

08:20.581 --> 08:22.673
Or trying to,
because I'm not buying
a word they say.

08:22.673 --> 08:25.175
My word is bond, son!

08:29.469 --> 08:30.891
What's happened to Jorge?

08:30.891 --> 08:33.263
(PARROT VOICE) Jorge. Jorge.
What's happened to Jorge?

08:33.263 --> 08:34.394
(SQUAWKING)

08:34.394 --> 08:36.767
Oh, no! The damage
to his frontal lobe

08:36.767 --> 08:39.730
seems to have induced
a case of Avianthropy!

08:39.730 --> 08:42.352
(CHUCKLES) Oh, please.
Jorge thinks he's a bird?

08:42.352 --> 08:44.234
Do you guys really think
I'm that stupid?

08:44.234 --> 08:47.027
Stupid. Stupid.
(SQUAWKING)

08:50.611 --> 08:53.243
Zuri, you weren't holding
your breath out there?

08:53.243 --> 08:58.208
Why would I hold my breath
when I have all this
beautiful fog to breath in?

08:58.208 --> 09:03.163
And I got to hug
four dead squirrels
on my way over here!

09:03.163 --> 09:04.875
Why do you sound
so happy?

09:04.875 --> 09:07.217
I'm always happy!

09:07.217 --> 09:12.673
Lou, Xander, have I ever
thanked you for being...

09:12.673 --> 09:14.635
Well, just the best darn
counselors ever?

09:17.057 --> 09:18.679
Zuri is complimenting us?

09:18.679 --> 09:19.850
She's been fogged!

09:21.481 --> 09:23.563
Guy, I just came from town!

09:23.563 --> 09:27.107
Everyone's infected by some
weird fog that's making
people crazy!

09:27.107 --> 09:28.899
The mayor thinks
he's a lobster!

09:28.899 --> 09:30.320
Wait, what?

09:30.320 --> 09:32.653
So, this fog
really is toxic?

09:32.653 --> 09:34.364
I can't believe
this is actually happening!

09:34.364 --> 09:36.156
Oh, it's happening,
all right.

09:36.156 --> 09:40.120
Anyone who breathes
that stuff goes totally
oyster crackers.

09:40.120 --> 09:43.834
(SQUAWKING)
Crackers! Crackers!
Jorge wants a cracker!

09:50.881 --> 09:53.343
Dang, girl!
Is the circus in town?
(CHUCKLES)

09:55.015 --> 09:58.018
(SQUAWKING)
Pretty bird. Pretty bird.

09:58.018 --> 09:59.429
Yes, you are!

09:59.429 --> 10:01.481
You're the prettiest
bird ever!

10:01.481 --> 10:04.685
(SQUAWKING)
Thank you.

10:04.685 --> 10:06.857
Murphy, you need to
drive them to the hospital!

10:06.857 --> 10:08.228
Or the vet.

10:08.228 --> 10:11.071
In what?
My motor scooter
only seats one.

10:11.071 --> 10:12.492
(SIGHS) This is horrible!

10:12.492 --> 10:17.447
Seriously. A grown man
driving a motor scooter
is tragic.

10:17.447 --> 10:18.739
Ugh! What are we
going to do?

10:18.739 --> 10:20.410
Well, the first thing
we should do

10:20.410 --> 10:21.832
is tape the door and windows
to keep the fog out.

10:23.543 --> 10:26.166
(SQUAWKS) Fog out!
Fog out! Fog out!

10:26.166 --> 10:28.508
I know where
the first piece of tape
is going.

10:28.508 --> 10:30.340
(MUFFLED SQUAWKS)

10:30.340 --> 10:31.712
Rip, you stupid tape!

10:31.712 --> 10:34.925
(GLASS SHATTERS)
Aw, son of a billfish!

10:34.925 --> 10:37.387
Murphy, you didn't breathe in
any of the fog, did you?

10:37.387 --> 10:38.468
It's all right.

10:38.468 --> 10:40.140
I ain't scared of no fog.

10:40.140 --> 10:43.313
I've got...
I've got tough lungs.

10:43.313 --> 10:45.896
I've been breathin' in
boat exhaust for decades,

10:45.896 --> 10:49.109
and I don't cough up
any more blood and mucus
than the average Joe.

10:49.109 --> 10:52.152
(COUGHING)

10:52.152 --> 10:54.825
Excuse me, miss,
who is that guy?

10:54.825 --> 10:58.408
Oh, that's Murphy,
our five-star chef.

10:58.408 --> 11:01.121
No, I meant that guy.
He's cute.

11:01.121 --> 11:02.662
I wonder if
he has a girlfriend.

11:02.662 --> 11:03.874
I do!

11:03.874 --> 11:04.705
Oh, darn.

11:04.705 --> 11:06.456
No, it's you!

11:06.456 --> 11:08.208
Emma, don't you remember me?

11:08.208 --> 11:09.629
Emma? Who's Emma?

11:13.423 --> 11:15.635
(GASPING)
Oh, this is bad!

11:15.635 --> 11:18.889
Her short-term memory loss
has turned into
full-blown amnesia.

11:18.889 --> 11:20.100
We need to call
for someone!

11:20.100 --> 11:21.431
The phones are down.

11:21.431 --> 11:23.103
How does fog
knock out phones?

11:23.103 --> 11:27.647
It doesn't.
Gladys not paying
the bill does.

11:27.647 --> 11:30.771
Then, somehow,
we need to get to
the next town for help.

11:30.771 --> 11:34.314
I'll go. I'm the adult.
Plus, I have the scooter.

11:34.314 --> 11:36.616
Although, then again,
maybe I shouldn't go.

11:36.616 --> 11:38.819
Driving my scooter
in this fog
might be dangerous,

11:38.819 --> 11:40.580
since the bell's broken.

11:40.580 --> 11:43.703
However, I could drive
very slowly and yell
"ding-ding-ding!"

11:43.703 --> 11:45.746
(LAUGHING) But, that's dumb.

11:45.746 --> 11:47.167
Although, it might work.

11:48.088 --> 11:49.750
Oh, no!

11:49.750 --> 11:51.962
Murphy is displaying
classic symptoms of
Hamlet Disease,

11:51.962 --> 11:55.385
a mental condition
that manifests itself
in crippling indecisiveness.

11:55.385 --> 11:57.838
Are you sure?
Yes. Watch.

11:57.838 --> 12:01.641
Hey, Murphy, which flavor
ice cream do you like best,
chocolate or vanilla?

12:01.641 --> 12:03.513
Vanilla.
No, wait, chocolate.

12:03.513 --> 12:05.435
(GASPS) Geez, I don't know.

12:05.435 --> 12:07.938
I mean, the classic
simplicity of vanilla
is delicious.

12:07.938 --> 12:09.399
However, the rich fullness
of chocolate...

12:09.399 --> 12:10.610
He's a goner.

12:12.312 --> 12:14.905
Xander, Lou, you guys
have to go for help!

12:14.905 --> 12:16.566
I don't want to go out
into a poisonous fog!

12:16.566 --> 12:17.858
Me neither!

12:17.858 --> 12:19.860
Well, I have to stay here.

12:19.860 --> 12:21.912
All right? My sweetie
needs her Xander!

12:21.912 --> 12:24.865
Hey guy,
your whatcha-ma-callit
is missing a round thingy.

12:27.127 --> 12:29.629
Okay, I'll go.

12:29.629 --> 12:33.874
A'ight then. That'll give me
a chance to spit some game
to this dime piece.

12:34.714 --> 12:35.876
Yeah, I'm goin' too.

12:38.048 --> 12:40.260

12:42.682 --> 12:44.434
Ugh, he ate his tape.

12:46.096 --> 12:47.727
Let's go!
Yeah.

12:47.727 --> 12:50.270
Wait. Before you go out
in that fog,

12:50.270 --> 12:51.731
you'll need
top of the line protection.

12:53.443 --> 12:56.776
This is top of the line?

12:56.776 --> 13:00.610
You could've at least
given us unused trash bags.

13:00.610 --> 13:03.203
Hey, I'm trying to save
your lives here!

13:03.203 --> 13:05.996
Now, these masks will filter
the neurotoxin from the air.

13:06.406 --> 13:07.617
How?

13:07.617 --> 13:09.409
I used Murphy's
French toast as a filter.

13:09.409 --> 13:12.542
He burns that stuff so badly,
the crust is basically
charcoal.

13:12.542 --> 13:13.914
Glad I could help.

13:13.914 --> 13:15.585
Or, did I?
(GASPS) I don't know.

13:18.088 --> 13:20.971
(SIGHS) All right, Xander,
let's do this.

13:20.971 --> 13:23.924
Emma, can I get a farewell,
good luck kiss?

13:23.924 --> 13:25.976
But I don't have
any lipstick on.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.599
And I don't even know you.

13:29.599 --> 13:32.432
(LAUGHS) You got clowned
by a clown, son!

13:34.985 --> 13:38.238
And finally, we need to
fill your suits with
creamed corn.

13:38.238 --> 13:40.610
Creamed corn?
Why do you need to do that?

13:40.610 --> 13:42.993
Scientifically speaking,
there is a chemical in the...

13:42.993 --> 13:44.784
Just fill us up.

13:49.039 --> 13:50.250
Ugh!

13:52.712 --> 13:54.915
Okay, that is not
a pleasant sensation.

13:56.506 --> 13:58.758
You could've at least
warmed it up first!

14:02.672 --> 14:05.425
No! I refuse to put
fish down my pants.

14:05.425 --> 14:07.017
Silly, it's not
for your pants.

14:07.017 --> 14:09.599
It's to suck on

14:09.599 --> 14:11.811
See, the omega three

14:31.791 --> 14:34.044
Actually, don't hurry,
'cause you could get hurt.

14:34.044 --> 14:36.296
Although, if you don't hurry,
we could die.

14:36.296 --> 14:39.799
On the other hand,
slow and steady does win
the race.

We'll go slow, but fast.

Booyah!

That's what you get
for pranking us last summer.

15:23.633 --> 15:25.805
I can't believe
we fell for that!

15:25.805 --> 15:27.387
I told you it was a prank!

the guts out of a mackerel.

15:31.221 --> 15:35.185

Oh, and don't throw out
that corn. I need it
for lunch tomorrow.

15:44.614 --> 15:46.156
Okay, okay,
you got us.

15:46.156 --> 15:47.567
Very impressive.

15:47.567 --> 15:49.990
Especially this fake fog,
it looks so real.

15:51.331 --> 15:53.373
We were just going to tie
your shoe laces together,

15:53.373 --> 15:55.285
but when we heard
the fog was rolling in,

15:55.285 --> 15:58.918
we decided an airborne
neurotoxin was the obvious
way to go.

15:58.918 --> 16:00.880
It was all my idea.

16:00.880 --> 16:02.462
Was not!
Was so!

16:02.462 --> 16:04.134
Then spell neurotoxin.

16:04.134 --> 16:05.255
Or fog.

16:07.047 --> 16:09.139
Okay, but I came up
with the bird thing.

16:09.139 --> 16:12.302
Of course. You both have

17:06.486 --> 17:08.278

it's dangerous. Listen.

carries a parasite.

there is not enough

20:59.969 --> 21:02.642
ALL: (IN DEEP VOICE)
You must breathe fog!

21:02.642 --> 21:04.554
Zuri, go hide
in the bathroom!

21:04.554 --> 21:06.185
You mean, Zuri and Ravi.

21:06.185 --> 21:07.557
No, Zuri is a camper.

21:07.557 --> 21:09.389
We have a responsibility
to protect her.

21:09.389 --> 21:11.691
You mean
you have a responsibility.

21:11.691 --> 21:14.894
You are a counselor,
and I am just a lowly CIT.

21:14.894 --> 21:17.196
Come on, Zuri,
let's go cower
in the bathroom.

21:17.196 --> 21:20.239
By the power vested in me,
I now declare you
a counselor!

21:20.239 --> 21:22.662
While honored,
I must humbly decline
this well-deserved,

21:22.662 --> 21:24.534
but poorly timed promotion.

21:24.534 --> 21:26.616
Since we agree
that I'm being protected,

21:26.616 --> 21:28.368
I'm getting my butt
in the bathroom.

21:30.330 --> 21:33.543
RAVI: Please, do not hurt me!
Take the girl!

21:33.543 --> 21:35.715
LOU: Ravi, you pathetic,
little... (SCREAMING)

21:39.879 --> 21:41.130
(DOOR CLOSES)

21:48.137 --> 21:49.479
(GASPS)

21:52.101 --> 21:54.434
Tiffany, thank goodness!

21:54.434 --> 21:57.026
Where is everyone else?
Are they okay?

21:57.026 --> 21:59.439
They're gone.
They're all gone.

21:59.439 --> 22:01.361
Come on, we have
to get out of here!

22:01.361 --> 22:04.283
No!
Let me help you...

22:06.706 --> 22:07.787
(GASPS)

22:07.787 --> 22:09.579
Breathe in the fog!

22:09.579 --> 22:10.329
(SCREAMS)

22:24.343 --> 22:27.887
So that's
my scary fog story.

22:27.887 --> 22:29.429
What do you think?

22:33.312 --> 22:34.353
(ALL LAUGHING)
