WEBVTT

01:14.465 --> 01:16.163
It was literally
one of the most traumatizing

01:16.337 --> 01:18.165
I'’ve ever had in
my whole goddamned life.

01:18.339 --> 01:20.993
Turn that shit down.
Ain'’t gonna tell you guys again.

01:21.168 --> 01:23.561
It was probably
my 8th birthday.
My mother was yelling at me.

01:23.735 --> 01:26.608
She was like, "Hey, you clown.
Why don'’t you go
to the fucking clown prison

01:26.782 --> 01:28.871
or the circus is gonna
come over here
and take you away

01:29.045 --> 01:31.613
with all the rest of you
and the rest of the clowns."

01:31.787 --> 01:34.050
That'’s what she kept telling me,
because my mom was a clown,

01:34.224 --> 01:36.574
just like you two clowns,
playing this NSA bullshit.

01:36.748 --> 01:39.273
That'’s what it is, you clowns.
Two fucking clowns!

01:39.447 --> 01:41.405
Goddamn it,
I gotta take a shit.

02:00.555 --> 02:02.296
All right, you guys ready?

02:02.470 --> 02:04.820
Rakestraw, you and me,
we'’re taking the front.

02:04.994 --> 02:07.649
Bledsoe, Manningham,
around the rear.Copy.

02:07.823 --> 02:09.520
Let'’s take these fuckers down.

02:46.992 --> 02:48.646
Hey! Get down, get down,
get down, get down!

02:48.820 --> 02:50.735
Get down, get down,
get down!

02:50.909 --> 02:52.607
Get the fuck down!
Get the fuck down!

02:55.958 --> 02:58.482
Put your fucking hands
in the fucking air!

03:19.155 --> 03:21.723
Shots fired, officer down.
Officer down.

03:45.790 --> 03:47.227
Fuck!

04:08.509 --> 04:09.858
Careful.

04:11.120 --> 04:12.469
One more step.

04:26.048 --> 04:27.354
Yeah.Yeah.

04:40.715 --> 04:42.499
He had a gun.

04:42.673 --> 04:44.196
Not on us.

04:44.371 --> 04:47.156
No, wasn'’t our fault.

04:51.813 --> 04:54.076
We were just
doing our jobs.

04:54.250 --> 04:55.947
Just doing our job.

04:57.340 --> 04:58.515
Yeah.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.702
Breaking news coming out
of Fitzgerald County.

05:11.876 --> 05:15.967
Cops performed a drug bust
on a suspected meth house
earlier today.

05:16.141 --> 05:18.405
A small team
led by Sergeant Fulbright

05:18.579 --> 05:21.973
found the tenants armed
and were fired at upon entry.

05:22.147 --> 05:24.062
Fulbright and his team
returned fire,

05:24.236 --> 05:26.282
killing three of the four
occupants.

05:26.456 --> 05:29.590
One officer was injured,
but is in stable condition.

05:29.764 --> 05:33.376
Located at 1308 Peach Avenue,
officers say the drug

05:33.550 --> 05:36.901
was one of several
on their list of targets.

05:37.075 --> 05:39.513
Sean Whitlock
was taken into custody,

05:39.687 --> 05:41.341
facing charges
of drug possession

05:41.515 --> 05:43.734
and assault
with a deadly weapon.

05:43.908 --> 05:46.084
Sean'’s brother Kyle Whitlock

05:46.258 --> 05:48.130
was among those killed
in the gunfight.

05:48.304 --> 05:51.263
Sources say they lived
in a two-family home,

05:51.438 --> 05:54.963
sharing it with the other
two suspects killed on sight.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.154
Ronald Whitlock?

06:12.328 --> 06:14.112
Maybe.I'’m not sure
if you heard,

06:14.286 --> 06:15.505
but there'’s been an incident.

06:17.812 --> 06:19.422
Is there a problem, sir?

06:22.730 --> 06:24.993
What kind of
question is that, son?

06:25.167 --> 06:26.864
There'’s no need
for the attitude.

06:28.475 --> 06:29.780
Cops killed them.

06:29.954 --> 06:31.565
A bit more complicated
than that.

06:31.739 --> 06:33.305
It'’s crystal clear to me.

06:33.480 --> 06:37.440
I think both of you should
get the fuck out of here

06:37.614 --> 06:40.791
before I-- I do something
really bad.

06:47.798 --> 06:49.539
I got a wife and two kids.

06:50.366 --> 06:51.846
So did I.

07:17.480 --> 07:20.222
Oh, my head.

07:26.620 --> 07:29.274
Ooh my, this is a bad one.

07:29.449 --> 07:33.365
Hey, Cal, how much did we drink
last night, baby?

07:35.716 --> 07:39.589
You didn'’t get in no fight,
you didn'’t make out with nobody.

07:41.112 --> 07:42.462
And we didn'’t drive.

07:43.288 --> 07:44.464
That'’s a win.

07:45.987 --> 07:47.249
Ooh.

07:49.643 --> 07:52.428
Oh, this is a bad one, Cal.

07:52.602 --> 07:54.474
Oh, come on, man.

08:04.179 --> 08:05.485
Fuck it.

08:12.927 --> 08:14.276
Come on, Tanner.

08:14.450 --> 08:16.408
You look like shit.

08:16.583 --> 08:19.020
Said the crackhead
on the front porch.

08:19.803 --> 08:21.370
What the hell you want?

08:21.544 --> 08:24.504
Seeing if I could bump a smoke,
grab a few bucks.

08:26.157 --> 08:27.985
You ever think
of getting cleaned up?

08:28.159 --> 08:30.031
Yeah.
Did you hear the big news?

08:30.205 --> 08:31.685
Nah, what?

08:31.859 --> 08:33.338
The cops,
they arrested the wrong guy,

08:33.513 --> 08:35.558
Kyle Whitlock,
he'’s innocent, man.

08:35.732 --> 08:37.908
And they killed Sean, dude.

08:38.082 --> 08:39.780
Oh, yeah?

08:39.954 --> 08:41.085
How you know that?

08:41.259 --> 08:42.826
I was there.
It'’s a cover-up.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.959
Right.

08:45.133 --> 08:47.744
And the aliens are
taking over the government.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.923
Man, is it cool if I hang out
here for a few hours?

08:57.362 --> 08:58.712
Thanks, Mack.

08:59.582 --> 09:00.975
You got it, Tanner.

10:11.219 --> 10:13.787
Right, let'’s keep moving it.
Roll on, roll on.

10:17.181 --> 10:18.879
Oh shit.

10:21.577 --> 10:23.971
Hey, man.
Morning, Mack.

10:24.798 --> 10:26.277
Good to see you, man.

10:26.451 --> 10:28.236
I heard you
tied one on last night.

10:28.410 --> 10:31.413
Well, good morning to you too,
Decks.

10:31.587 --> 10:32.980
Hey, you let me
see your badge, man.

10:33.154 --> 10:34.982
Let'’s get you in here.All right.

10:36.374 --> 10:37.593
There you go.

10:37.767 --> 10:39.203
All right, let me see.

10:41.336 --> 10:43.120
Okay, now-- Oh, shit.
Wait a minute.

10:43.294 --> 10:45.862
It says your badge
is expired today, man.

10:46.036 --> 10:47.647
If you'’re gonna stay on,

10:47.821 --> 10:49.387
you'’re gonna need to go see
human resources

10:49.561 --> 10:51.563
and get a new badge.Oh, come on, Decks.

10:51.738 --> 10:54.175
Ah, you can handle that, man.
That'’s how it works.

10:54.349 --> 10:55.480
All right.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.048
Have a good one.

11:00.529 --> 11:02.792
All right, next.
Roll on, roll on.

11:02.966 --> 11:05.752
Come on, let'’s go.
Here we go.

11:10.495 --> 11:12.367
Good morning, Mack.
You still here?

11:12.541 --> 11:14.499
Oh yeah.
Loving every minute of it.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.501
Damn, girl, you about to pop.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.461
Any minute, I'’ll tell ya,
just over here, having a ball.

11:19.635 --> 11:22.377
I'’ll bet. Hey, Paula.

11:22.551 --> 11:25.032
You tell your old man for me,
I ain'’t paying
that speeding ticket.

11:25.206 --> 11:26.468
All right, Mack,
I'’ma tell him.

11:26.642 --> 11:27.687
No, no, for real.

11:29.906 --> 11:30.907
Asshole.

11:39.002 --> 11:41.091
Oh, come on.

11:45.226 --> 11:46.227
Well.Yeah.

11:50.666 --> 11:52.668
Come on, let'’s go.
Keep it moving, keep it moving.

11:52.842 --> 11:54.148
This is not your first rodeo.

11:54.322 --> 11:55.758
There we go.

11:55.932 --> 11:58.718
There we-- Holy shit.
Look who it is.

11:58.892 --> 12:01.198
M-A-C-K Karr,
Mr. Touchdown.

12:01.372 --> 12:03.113
What up, baby?
You know,

12:03.287 --> 12:05.289
last night,
you were ranting and raving

12:05.463 --> 12:07.161
about how you'’re about to
light up for the territories.

12:07.335 --> 12:09.293
I know what I said, Blaylock.

12:09.467 --> 12:11.861
I was there, damn it. Just...

12:12.035 --> 12:15.343
you know,
had a change of heart.Change of heart?

12:15.517 --> 12:19.086
Since when?
Since last night?Oh. Ha-ha!

12:19.260 --> 12:22.567
Come on, let'’s go,
keep it moving. This ain'’t
your first rodeo, there we go.

12:27.137 --> 12:30.837
I did not think I'’d see
your ass in work today.

12:31.011 --> 12:34.362
You were saddled up with me
at the bar last night.

12:34.536 --> 12:36.538
And I only remember
drinking beer.

12:36.712 --> 12:39.454
Oh no, brother,
we went hard after that.

12:40.629 --> 12:42.239
I didn'’t know any better,

12:42.413 --> 12:44.372
I'’d think somebody slipped me
a Mickey.

12:44.546 --> 12:46.504
Why don'’t you take the day off?
Go home.

12:46.678 --> 12:49.551
Oh come on, Boone.
We'’re cut from
tougher cloth than that.

12:50.987 --> 12:52.597
Rangers lead the way, brother.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.251
All the way, baby.

13:14.706 --> 13:17.274
Hey, Skip.
Cranbrook.

13:17.448 --> 13:18.754
Fitzgerald Hydroelectric.

13:18.928 --> 13:20.408
Cranbrook,
how is it looking, man?

13:20.582 --> 13:22.105
Good, really good.

13:22.279 --> 13:24.151
Except one small school bus
coming in.

13:24.325 --> 13:25.848
That'’s about it.

13:26.022 --> 13:27.894
All right,
I got eyes on you, man.

13:28.068 --> 13:30.070
Great. Appreciate you.

13:44.780 --> 13:46.434
Uh, look at that.

13:46.608 --> 13:47.957
Bummed me
with a pair of twos.

13:49.567 --> 13:51.221
What'’d you get, Cranbrook?

13:57.010 --> 13:58.272
Goddamn.

13:59.577 --> 14:01.797
Howdy, Mack.Oh hey.

14:01.971 --> 14:03.625
What they got you on today?

14:03.799 --> 14:06.541
Well, they got me over at
Floodgate 8.

14:07.498 --> 14:09.674
Did you hear back from UGA?

14:09.849 --> 14:13.591
No. Guess I'’m just gonna
have to keep welding by day. Hey, Amy.

14:14.984 --> 14:16.812
Did you hear back from GT?

14:17.813 --> 14:20.076
I'’ll see you around, Mack.Yeah.

14:21.425 --> 14:23.123
I don'’t know why
she does me like that.

14:23.297 --> 14:25.299
Well, GT is Georgia Tech.

14:25.473 --> 14:28.998
So, Amy'’s hoping
for Georgia Bulldog
Graduate School.

14:29.172 --> 14:32.306
I heard you
made a scene last night
at the juke joint.

14:32.480 --> 14:33.873
A scene?

14:34.047 --> 14:36.092
Moi? No.

14:36.963 --> 14:38.790
Hollering about leaving.

14:38.965 --> 14:41.141
Mack, you'’ve only
been back for a month.

14:42.794 --> 14:45.580
Did you get the box I sent?Yeah.

14:45.754 --> 14:49.714
I mean, did you have to
send all the pictures,
Soph, I mean?

14:49.889 --> 14:51.803
You know, didn'’t you at least
wanna keep a couple?

14:51.978 --> 14:53.762
I kept one or two.

14:53.936 --> 14:55.938
Just in case you don'’t come back
from one of those trips

14:56.112 --> 14:58.332
you take with
your old Special Forces buddies?

14:58.506 --> 15:00.682
Well, we all can'’t be
silver-spoon-up-the-ass,

15:00.856 --> 15:02.640
corporate types like Smith,
now can we?

15:02.814 --> 15:04.729
Mack, don'’t start.Now I get it.

15:04.904 --> 15:08.385
So if I had learned just
a little bit less than you--Okay, stop.

15:08.559 --> 15:09.909
About running this place--Mack, stop.

15:10.083 --> 15:11.345
No, no, and gone head to
head with you

15:11.519 --> 15:12.868
for the position
of plant director,

15:13.042 --> 15:14.914
and beat you out...

15:15.088 --> 15:16.828
then we'’d be together.

15:17.003 --> 15:18.352
Is that what
you'’re telling me?No.

15:18.526 --> 15:20.267
If you had just stopped
being a dick,

15:20.441 --> 15:21.877
then we'’d be together.

15:24.097 --> 15:27.100
Oh.But we both know that'’s not
gonna happen, now do we?

15:29.624 --> 15:32.932
I'’m so much more qualified
to run this place than him
and you know it.

15:33.106 --> 15:35.935
You left me, remember?

15:36.109 --> 15:37.675
Is there a problem here?

15:41.549 --> 15:42.724
No.

15:43.725 --> 15:45.031
No, we all good.

15:49.296 --> 15:51.211
Who ate your breakfast,
Cranbrook?

15:51.385 --> 15:52.777
Come on, now.

16:18.803 --> 16:21.850
Have a great day.
See you later.

16:41.739 --> 16:43.959
Come on, hi.

16:44.133 --> 16:46.570
Okay, welcome
to Fitzgerald Hydroelectric.

16:46.744 --> 16:50.661
Raise your hand if you'’ve
ever been inside a dam?

16:53.316 --> 16:56.015
Okay. Who'’s ready?
Yeah.

16:59.453 --> 17:02.238
Hey, you got this,
'’cause I got to hit the john?Right on time.

17:02.412 --> 17:04.240
Hey, you gotta keep it
regular, right?

17:50.025 --> 17:52.332
Shit.
Base, this is Checkpoint Alpha.

17:52.506 --> 17:54.377
We got anybody else
coming in today?

17:54.551 --> 17:56.597
Hello, Base?

17:57.424 --> 17:58.599
Are you there?

17:58.773 --> 17:59.948
Base, do you copy?

18:00.122 --> 18:02.124
Hello? Hello?

18:07.738 --> 18:09.000
What the hell?

18:10.567 --> 18:14.049
Base?

18:30.674 --> 18:33.155
Tried to get you
to join the team, Jared.

18:46.690 --> 18:48.301
Boone'’s on line.

18:56.483 --> 18:57.875
Wait, you-- Ah!

19:04.578 --> 19:08.234
What the hell is going on?Call Cranbrook. Tell him to put
us on a Level Three alert.

19:08.408 --> 19:11.498
And tell him to call
Homeland Security.

19:11.672 --> 19:14.109
This is Smith,
get me the NSA immediately.

19:26.817 --> 19:29.211
Pick up.
Pick up, pick up.

19:29.385 --> 19:30.908
Cranbrook, answer, goddamn it.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.303
Get up! Get your hands up!

19:34.477 --> 19:37.088
Hurry up, move, move!

19:37.263 --> 19:39.090
Move your ass downstairs!Hurry up!

19:39.265 --> 19:42.311
Get your hands up!
Get your fucking hands up!

19:42.485 --> 19:43.878
Move, move, move.

19:44.052 --> 19:46.315
Hey, motherfucker,
hands up, hands up!

19:46.489 --> 19:48.665
Hands up.
Downstairs, get downstairs.

19:56.020 --> 19:59.023
Smith was trying to call
us, but his line went dead.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.809
I saw the
deactivation, sorry about that.

20:01.983 --> 20:04.638
We had one more school bus
trickle in that
we didn'’t know about.

20:04.812 --> 20:07.771
Weird, hopefully they
aren'’t in the way too much. Yeah.

20:07.945 --> 20:09.686
Well, holler
if you need anything.

20:09.860 --> 20:12.123
Yeah,
should be back on now.

20:12.298 --> 20:15.039
All right,
you have a great day.

20:42.893 --> 20:44.721
Holy shit.

20:44.895 --> 20:47.202
Okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay.

20:57.081 --> 20:59.258
Oh no, mm-mmm.

20:59.432 --> 21:01.477
I did not sign up for this shit.

21:01.651 --> 21:04.045
Especially not for no
whack-ass dam, mm-mmm.

21:06.308 --> 21:09.485
Let me see
your hands! Against the wall!

21:09.659 --> 21:11.139
Against the wall!

21:11.313 --> 21:13.402
Against the wall,
hands up!

21:13.576 --> 21:16.579
Don'’t you say a word either.
You just stand there
and shut up!

21:19.887 --> 21:23.238
Let'’s go,
let'’s go, come on.
Against the wall.

21:24.587 --> 21:27.373
You wanna tell me
what the hell
is going on here?

21:27.547 --> 21:29.810
You'’ll find out
soon enough.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.081
Who'’s got eyes on Smith?

21:40.255 --> 21:42.344
I wanna talk to him.

21:42.518 --> 21:44.433
I wanna talk to him right now!

21:46.522 --> 21:49.308
Tried to warn you about
that last union contract.

21:50.874 --> 21:52.267
I got him.

21:56.750 --> 21:58.360
It'’s not personal.

22:02.712 --> 22:05.933
This is Smith,
the police are on the way.

22:06.107 --> 22:09.676
Oh Smith,
this is our first disagreement.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.419
A few more and it won'’t be good.

22:18.815 --> 22:20.556
Show me Paula.

22:20.730 --> 22:22.384
Paula Fulbright.

22:27.302 --> 22:28.521
Phone down!

22:28.695 --> 22:30.479
Come on, get out, get out.

22:33.439 --> 22:35.049
Please, no.

22:35.223 --> 22:38.139
Jesus Christ, Boone,
what the hell are you doing?

22:38.313 --> 22:41.664
She'’s pregnant
and there are kids here today.

22:41.838 --> 22:43.144
Your point?

22:43.318 --> 22:45.625
You'’re not as tough
as you think.

22:49.629 --> 22:51.195
Boo!

22:53.023 --> 22:54.329
Two for flinching.

22:54.503 --> 22:57.593
Hey, come here.
Take this, take this.

22:57.767 --> 22:59.378
You, watch her.

22:59.552 --> 23:01.162
Get in here.Grab her.

23:01.336 --> 23:02.555
Get over there,
against the wall.

23:02.729 --> 23:04.948
Against the wall.
Both of '’em.

23:07.255 --> 23:08.169
Round '’em up.

23:08.343 --> 23:09.910
Including the children.

23:11.215 --> 23:13.217
Move, move, move, move!Let'’s go, move it.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.176
Move. Come on, let'’s go.

23:15.350 --> 23:17.396
Hands up.Hands up.

23:17.570 --> 23:18.745
Move!

23:18.919 --> 23:20.703
Get '’em down here now!

23:20.877 --> 23:22.966
Get '’em down!
Get over here.

23:23.140 --> 23:26.013
Get in there!Get these kids over here
right now.

23:26.187 --> 23:29.233
Move your ass.
I said, move your ass.

23:29.408 --> 23:31.105
Hey! Hey!Move it!

23:31.279 --> 23:34.935
How could you do this?What happened wasn'’t right.

23:35.109 --> 23:37.154
You know that, too.Were you there?

23:37.328 --> 23:40.157
Now'’s not the time
to get smart with me.

23:40.331 --> 23:41.507
Get the fuck out of my face.

23:41.681 --> 23:43.422
Get these kids over there!

23:43.596 --> 23:45.641
Get over! Move!Move right now!

23:47.208 --> 23:49.079
Get down on your fucking knees!

23:49.253 --> 23:50.777
Get on your knees!

23:51.821 --> 23:53.127
Now you listen to me.

23:54.258 --> 23:56.696
If I see one small move,

23:56.870 --> 24:01.788
we'’re gonna be
sending you home in a body bag
to your mama and your papa.

24:01.962 --> 24:03.224
You hear me?

24:04.355 --> 24:05.618
We are not joking!

24:10.274 --> 24:12.625
Are you okay? He needs help.

24:12.799 --> 24:15.323
Boone, Boone, he needs help.

24:15.497 --> 24:17.586
What do you want me to do, huh?

24:17.760 --> 24:19.893
Bring me Smith.

24:20.067 --> 24:21.111
Roger that.

24:21.285 --> 24:22.678
Are you fucking kidding me?

24:22.852 --> 24:24.593
You got '’em.

24:24.767 --> 24:26.900
It'’s okay.
We'’re gonna get you help, okay?

24:27.074 --> 24:29.032
We'’re gonna figure this out.

24:29.206 --> 24:31.426
Is everyone okay?
We'’re gonna be okay.

24:39.042 --> 24:41.958
All right, tough guy, you'’re up.

24:42.132 --> 24:44.352
Where are you taking me?Shut the fuck up.

24:52.273 --> 24:54.014
Hey, get me!

26:07.696 --> 26:09.872
Holliday, Connecticut...

26:12.048 --> 26:13.833
Dam teams, check in.

26:14.660 --> 26:16.052
Holliday, Connecticut,

26:16.226 --> 26:18.446
dam team, check in.

26:18.620 --> 26:21.101
Anybody got eyes on
Connecticut or Holliday?

26:30.632 --> 26:31.981
Move.

26:36.682 --> 26:37.944
I said, move your ass.

26:41.251 --> 26:44.515
All employees
are now hostages.Good.

26:46.343 --> 26:47.954
I want a head count.

26:48.128 --> 26:51.914
Make sure my men are here
and accounted for.

26:53.002 --> 26:54.700
Make sure we have a perimeter.

26:55.831 --> 26:57.703
I don'’t wanna have
any cops here.

26:59.443 --> 27:01.489
Roger that.All right.

27:49.363 --> 27:50.843
Where'’d he go?

27:52.192 --> 27:53.672
Let'’s check
over here.

27:54.890 --> 27:56.326
Anybody see?

27:58.589 --> 28:01.201
He'’s not here.

28:04.117 --> 28:05.466
Clear up here.

28:08.251 --> 28:09.688
Check the stairway.

28:09.862 --> 28:11.298
Got it.

28:18.479 --> 28:20.133
Nothing on '’em.

29:26.329 --> 29:27.548
Shut up, shut up.

29:27.722 --> 29:29.419
Shut the fuck up.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.343
Sorry, brother.

30:06.456 --> 30:08.807
Whoa, whoa,
don'’t shoot, it'’s me.

30:08.981 --> 30:12.332
Blaylock.
What the hell are you doing
in the damn bathroom, man?

30:12.506 --> 30:14.421
I don'’t know,
I was in here doing my business.

30:14.595 --> 30:16.510
I heard gun shots,
so I popped my head out.

30:16.684 --> 30:18.642
And I'’m seeing soldiers
pushing people around.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.383
Some security guard you are.

30:20.557 --> 30:21.732
They got guns.

30:21.907 --> 30:22.995
You got a goddamn gun.

30:23.169 --> 30:24.605
Yeah, but they got better guns.

30:24.779 --> 30:27.042
Got no signal.

30:27.216 --> 30:29.740
Shit. They must have jammed it.

30:29.915 --> 30:31.699
I mean, what the hell
do these guys want anyway?

30:31.873 --> 30:33.309
How the hell am I
supposed to know?

30:33.483 --> 30:35.703
Fuck! I didn'’t sign up
for this shit.

30:35.877 --> 30:38.184
What are we gonna do?
Aren'’t you like ex-military
or something?

30:39.011 --> 30:40.099
And then some.

30:40.882 --> 30:42.101
Come on.

30:45.669 --> 30:47.889
Hey, Cranbrook,
where you at?

30:50.109 --> 30:51.806
Just chilling at Starbucks,
you want something?

30:51.980 --> 30:53.112
Where the fuck
you think I'’m at?

30:53.286 --> 30:54.330
Where'’s the welder?

30:54.504 --> 30:55.810
Welder?

30:55.984 --> 30:57.725
Yeah, fucking Mack Karr,
where'’s he at?

30:57.899 --> 30:59.553
I know what'’s going on,
you fucked up.

30:59.727 --> 31:01.598
Mack Karr'’s not supposed
to be here today, idiot.

31:01.772 --> 31:04.166
You look at those
fancy screens in front of you?

31:05.385 --> 31:07.953
I ain'’t seeing shit, Gator.

31:08.127 --> 31:11.782
Fuck, waste of time.
I'’m going to the dam.
This is useless.

31:19.355 --> 31:21.401
We got kids here today?Yeah.

31:21.575 --> 31:23.272
How many?I don'’t know, about 20.

31:23.446 --> 31:25.144
Shit. Sophia with them?

31:25.318 --> 31:26.667
I believe so.

31:48.515 --> 31:49.603
What is it?

31:50.517 --> 31:51.648
Money?

31:55.522 --> 31:58.568
Listen, my family--I know about your family.

32:00.179 --> 32:02.007
I don'’t want your damn money.

32:02.181 --> 32:04.357
You'’re an entitled little prick,

32:04.531 --> 32:07.664
like a-- an annoying rich kid.

32:07.838 --> 32:09.840
You think soldiers are free?

32:10.015 --> 32:13.018
I got plenty of money.
And I'’ll spend all of it.

32:13.192 --> 32:15.020
That'’s who the fuck I am.

32:16.325 --> 32:18.023
All right.

32:18.197 --> 32:21.504
So all this is
about you fighting the system?

32:21.678 --> 32:23.115
That'’s right.

32:23.289 --> 32:25.160
Something you know
nothing about.

32:27.119 --> 32:28.598
Enter your override code.

32:30.122 --> 32:31.427
Excuse me?

32:31.601 --> 32:32.863
You heard what the fuck I said.

32:33.864 --> 32:36.258
Enter your code.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.872
And what if I don'’t?

32:45.833 --> 32:48.053
If you don'’t enter your code,

32:48.227 --> 32:51.317
I'’ll make a small gesture
with my finger like this.

32:51.491 --> 32:53.058
And then you'’ll have
a nice little bullet

32:53.232 --> 32:54.798
rattling around in
your fucking skull.

32:54.973 --> 32:56.626
Get the fuck over there.

33:02.545 --> 33:03.894
Do it.

33:14.122 --> 33:15.515
There'’s a good boy.

33:15.689 --> 33:19.519
Now, pull up
the floodgate override.

33:19.693 --> 33:22.000
I strongly advise that
we don'’t do that.

33:23.827 --> 33:27.309
That will cause flooding.

33:27.483 --> 33:30.965
The water level will raise
too much. Please don'’t
make me do that.

33:31.139 --> 33:33.620
Did it sound like
I was asking you?

33:33.794 --> 33:37.667
Listen.
There are 100,000 people
that live in this county.

33:37.841 --> 33:40.279
Families, homes, businesses,
they will all get destroyed.

33:40.453 --> 33:42.498
Do you understand
people will die?

33:42.672 --> 33:45.458
Good. This is my legacy.

33:46.328 --> 33:48.113
Your legacy?

33:49.897 --> 33:52.204
Thank you.

33:52.378 --> 33:56.121
You should try
a little bit of crazy.

33:56.295 --> 33:58.514
I'’ll flood this whole place.

34:02.475 --> 34:05.956
See now, I told you,
two for flinching.

34:06.131 --> 34:10.178
Now, open the fucking gate.

34:20.493 --> 34:21.929
Operations.

34:22.103 --> 34:25.498
Yeah, this is Smith, 4-7-6.

34:27.891 --> 34:29.850
Open Gate 3.

34:52.351 --> 34:55.615
I just caused a lot of damage.

34:55.789 --> 34:59.140
That'’s right.
Your daddy could have
billions more...

35:00.446 --> 35:01.882
it still wouldn'’t help.

35:03.579 --> 35:06.974
I would flood this whole
fucking town.

35:07.975 --> 35:12.806
Everyone would drown,
even me.

35:14.199 --> 35:15.635
You'’re a sick man.

35:15.809 --> 35:17.637
Yeah, we'’ll talk
about that later.

35:18.464 --> 35:19.595
Will we?

35:20.509 --> 35:22.163
Oh, I already mentioned that.

35:25.384 --> 35:27.386
Roll the camera.

35:31.433 --> 35:33.653
I want all of '’em to see me.

35:51.061 --> 35:52.150
Here we go.

35:52.324 --> 35:55.501
Live from Bumfuck, Georgia.

35:57.329 --> 35:58.895
All right, everybody.

36:00.506 --> 36:02.029
I hope you'’re settled in.

36:04.814 --> 36:07.426
If all goes well,

36:07.600 --> 36:09.819
the floodgates will be closed.

36:10.994 --> 36:12.213
However...

36:13.910 --> 36:17.479
if things don'’t go to my--
my satisfaction,

36:18.698 --> 36:22.180
it'’s gonna be Hurricane Katrina

36:23.181 --> 36:25.095
all over again.

36:25.270 --> 36:27.054
But this time,

36:27.228 --> 36:30.013
here in South Georgia.

36:31.841 --> 36:33.191
Let'’s get on with it.

36:34.279 --> 36:35.802
Ms. Fulbright.

36:35.976 --> 36:37.151
Where you at, Cankles?

36:46.595 --> 36:48.728
All right. Let'’s go, Paula.

36:49.990 --> 36:50.947
No.

36:55.213 --> 36:56.649
Package is en route.

36:58.825 --> 37:02.872
Three of ours are KIA.
Two workers are unaccounted for.

37:05.484 --> 37:08.356
What did you do?
You recruit pussies?

37:11.794 --> 37:15.233
Mack Karr, Army Ranger.

37:16.538 --> 37:18.323
Is it real?Yeah.

37:21.891 --> 37:23.980
Working at a fucking dam?

37:24.154 --> 37:27.680
I'’m just now hearing
about this guy?

37:27.854 --> 37:29.595
Why don'’t you ask
your inside man?

37:29.769 --> 37:30.987
He won'’t be a problem.

37:31.161 --> 37:32.946
He'’s already a problem.

37:34.426 --> 37:36.645
Yeah, he wasn'’t in my sector.

37:36.819 --> 37:38.821
Kiss my Cuban ass.Shut up.

37:40.258 --> 37:42.869
Yeah, you sissies wanna
fight in a playground?

37:43.739 --> 37:46.481
Fine, find him.

37:47.656 --> 37:48.570
Right now.

37:48.744 --> 37:50.180
Roger that.

37:54.184 --> 37:55.360
Hey.

37:56.622 --> 37:58.276
What'’s with you
and Mack Karr?

37:58.450 --> 38:00.539
There'’s nothing with me
and Mack Karr.

38:00.713 --> 38:02.758
What are you guys,
butt buddies or something?

38:02.932 --> 38:07.372
Whatever Ron'’s paying you,
it'’s too much.

38:08.895 --> 38:10.157
Fucker.

38:11.941 --> 38:13.726
Do you know who I am?

38:15.336 --> 38:16.685
No?

38:17.904 --> 38:19.775
I don'’t know you at all.

38:21.647 --> 38:25.085
You'’re just collateral damage.

38:27.305 --> 38:29.394
Boys, let'’s get her a phone.

38:30.960 --> 38:32.745
An outside line

38:32.919 --> 38:35.574
and a box of tissues.

38:37.053 --> 38:38.620
She'’s gonna need it.

38:45.932 --> 38:49.109
All available sentries move
to the junkyard, now.

38:52.591 --> 38:54.419
Move, move, move. Move it.

38:54.593 --> 38:56.595
Come on, let'’s go.Move!

39:06.822 --> 39:10.348
You should have seen my wife
when she was pregnant.

39:12.132 --> 39:14.264
She was nearly bedridden.

39:16.179 --> 39:18.530
No way, she couldn'’t have
handled this.

39:21.228 --> 39:22.403
Boy or girl?

39:24.362 --> 39:25.624
It'’s a girl.

39:26.625 --> 39:28.278
Congratulations.

39:30.977 --> 39:32.108
Watch the sniper.

39:38.724 --> 39:39.899
Come on, Blaylock!

39:45.383 --> 39:47.210
Come on, Blaylock, take cover.

39:48.647 --> 39:50.083
Where now?

39:50.257 --> 39:52.390
There'’s a boat,
there'’s a boat.

40:07.405 --> 40:09.537
Mack! Sniper on the roof!

40:21.375 --> 40:24.683
Untie the fucking boat!Yeah, I'’m trying,
just give me cover!

40:45.355 --> 40:47.880
Why don'’t we go
to the other side
and just get help?

40:48.054 --> 40:51.187
We leave now,
them kids'’ chances
go from slim to none.

40:52.841 --> 40:57.237
Just breathe,
just breathe, okay?

40:59.457 --> 41:00.936
What the fuck is this?

41:01.110 --> 41:02.677
What the fuck is this?

41:02.851 --> 41:04.026
What is this, show and tell?

41:04.200 --> 41:05.985
Get the fuck back!

41:06.159 --> 41:08.466
You want me to show you what
a bullet can do to a human body?

41:08.640 --> 41:09.684
Huh?

41:09.858 --> 41:11.730
He'’s dying, Boone.

41:11.904 --> 41:13.993
We need to call an ambulance.

41:16.822 --> 41:18.476
That can'’t happen, not yet.

41:25.831 --> 41:27.354
Can I get someone
from the medical team

41:27.528 --> 41:29.791
down to the cafeteria
immediately?

41:33.752 --> 41:35.493
You disgust me.

41:50.420 --> 41:53.336
They got off the dock
at the other facility. Move in.

41:53.511 --> 41:55.208
Got it, I'’m on it.

41:56.775 --> 41:57.863
You got a name?

41:59.647 --> 42:01.693
Either Lynn or Laura.

42:02.911 --> 42:04.260
Laura.

42:05.653 --> 42:07.002
Oh, that'’s beautiful.

42:08.830 --> 42:11.616
It was my sister'’s name,
she passed away.

42:12.791 --> 42:14.401
I'’m-- I'’m very sorry.

42:15.184 --> 42:17.056
Natural causes?

42:18.492 --> 42:20.363
It was a drunk driver.

42:20.538 --> 42:22.409
Hit and run outside Austin.

42:22.583 --> 42:24.019
Shit.

42:29.242 --> 42:30.896
That'’s terrible.

42:31.070 --> 42:32.550
Did they get the guy?

42:33.899 --> 42:35.248
It was a she.

42:35.422 --> 42:38.817
And yeah, she'’s up for parole
in five years.

42:39.861 --> 42:42.560
Stings, doesn'’t it?

42:44.431 --> 42:45.650
Sorry.

42:58.619 --> 43:00.795
I need you to do me a favor.

43:02.318 --> 43:03.929
I need you to call your husband.

43:07.889 --> 43:10.326
You tell him exactly what I say.

43:25.254 --> 43:27.517
Hey.

43:27.692 --> 43:30.999
I need you just to stop
by the dam real quick

43:31.173 --> 43:33.088
Yeah?

43:34.350 --> 43:37.789
Um, yeah, yeah,
I guess I can swing there.

43:37.963 --> 43:40.095
Everything all right?

43:40.269 --> 43:42.532
We'’ve gotten some calls
about the water levels rising. Yeah.

43:42.707 --> 43:44.883
Everything'’s fine. All right, sweetie.

43:45.057 --> 43:47.929
I'’ll see you soon, okay?Okay, see you soon.

43:56.198 --> 43:59.332
Hey, chief.
I'’m gonna head up to the dam,
take my wife something.

43:59.506 --> 44:02.074
All right, be careful.
Call you if I need you.

44:02.248 --> 44:03.292
Copy that.

44:07.166 --> 44:08.646
I appreciate that, Paula.

44:12.171 --> 44:15.261
Do you have, uh, a preschool?

44:18.220 --> 44:20.048
Well, you gotta get on that.

44:21.571 --> 44:25.619
All right, gentlemen,
what'’s the latest on the welder?

44:31.538 --> 44:32.974
Take that ladder.

44:34.106 --> 44:35.324
Come on.

44:37.631 --> 44:39.720
Come on, man.Yeah, man, I'’m trying.

44:46.031 --> 44:49.861
Mack! Where are you,
you annoying bastard?

44:52.472 --> 44:53.429
Shit.

45:00.610 --> 45:02.221
Fuck that.

45:05.615 --> 45:07.008
Hey, you go up there,

45:07.182 --> 45:08.270
he'’s gonna pick us up
one by one.

45:08.444 --> 45:10.272
Hey, Mack Karr!

45:10.446 --> 45:11.883
You hear me,
you son of a bitch?

45:12.797 --> 45:14.363
How about you, Tommy Blaylock?

45:14.537 --> 45:16.322
I'’m gonna fucking kill you.

45:21.762 --> 45:23.721
Hold your fire. Let'’s move.

45:33.295 --> 45:35.123
Gator, boss wants an update.

45:35.297 --> 45:38.300
He'’s not my boss,
he'’s my client.

45:40.476 --> 45:41.826
Do you have eyes on Mack?

45:42.957 --> 45:44.480
He'’s idle on the plant.

45:44.654 --> 45:46.613
We go up there,
we'’re sitting ducks.

45:46.787 --> 45:50.008
Then I suggest you find
alternative access, hoss.

45:51.139 --> 45:52.140
That guy.

46:12.813 --> 46:15.816
Gator, Fulbright'’s
approaching the gate.

46:15.990 --> 46:17.731
Don'’t let the welder move.

46:19.428 --> 46:21.256
I'’m gonna take care of the cop.

46:37.664 --> 46:39.361
One cop?

46:39.535 --> 46:41.450
They sent only one cop?

46:41.624 --> 46:43.409
You gotta be shitting me.

46:43.583 --> 46:45.193
And it'’s Fulbright?

46:45.367 --> 46:47.630
That son of a bitch gave me
a speeding ticket last week.

46:47.805 --> 46:49.719
Bet he'’s in on it.

46:49.894 --> 46:52.113
This is Red Five,
got a present for you Alpha.

46:52.287 --> 46:53.723
What was that?

46:56.857 --> 46:58.206
I'’m just a security guard.

46:58.380 --> 47:00.774
Hey, hey, hey.

47:00.948 --> 47:03.472
You'’re not just
a security guard, man.I'’m not?

47:03.646 --> 47:06.345
No, Blaylock,
you'’re the fucking man.I am?

47:06.519 --> 47:09.783
That'’s right.
And that'’s why you'’re gonna
take this walkie-talkie

47:09.957 --> 47:12.438
and you'’re gonna go
and you'’re gonna get that bus,

47:12.612 --> 47:14.744
and you'’re gonna take the bus,
and you'’re gonna go
to the front entrance,

47:14.919 --> 47:16.616
and you'’re gonna get them kids
out of here.

47:16.790 --> 47:18.183
By myself?That'’s right.

47:18.357 --> 47:20.663
Why?Because I'’m the man?

47:20.838 --> 47:22.840
Because you'’re the fucking man.

47:23.014 --> 47:25.059
And when you get there,
you'’re gonna go
to channel five

47:25.233 --> 47:27.061
and you'’re gonna
call me till you get me.

47:27.235 --> 47:29.585
You'’re the fucking man.I'’m the man.

47:30.978 --> 47:33.024
I'’m the motherfucking man.

47:38.116 --> 47:41.859
Hey, hey, hey,
what the hell'’s going on?

47:42.598 --> 47:44.122
Remember me?

47:44.296 --> 47:45.210
Gator.

47:45.384 --> 47:46.864
Oh!

47:47.038 --> 47:48.735
Ah, fuck.Let'’s go, buddy.

47:48.909 --> 47:50.345
Get off me, get off me.

47:50.519 --> 47:51.564
Gun!

47:51.738 --> 47:53.479
Get the gun!Get the gun!

47:55.089 --> 47:56.264
Take him.

47:58.571 --> 48:00.355
Talk to me, Red Five.

48:00.529 --> 48:02.618
Got Fulbright.Outstanding.

48:02.792 --> 48:05.447
Bring his sorry ass here.

48:06.492 --> 48:08.059
The main computer room.

48:09.103 --> 48:10.409
And hurry up.

48:11.584 --> 48:13.499
I got a bone to pick with him.

51:19.772 --> 51:22.514
Um, sorry, kids.

51:22.688 --> 51:25.125
Mack,
you scared the shit out of them.

51:25.299 --> 51:28.085
I'’m kind of
winging it here, Soph.

51:31.827 --> 51:34.395
So, got your little fucking
piggy over here.

51:34.569 --> 51:36.136
Come here, sit down.

51:36.310 --> 51:38.791
Fucking piece of shit cop.

51:38.965 --> 51:40.097
Fuck.

51:51.978 --> 51:53.588
What is this?

51:55.286 --> 51:58.637
You'’re a fugitive,
you killed two cops.

52:02.249 --> 52:05.426
Yeah, hard to change it.

52:05.600 --> 52:07.254
We have that in common.

52:09.604 --> 52:11.650
What the fuck
are you talking about?

52:14.479 --> 52:16.437
You remember my son?

52:18.874 --> 52:20.311
You do, don'’t you?

52:23.227 --> 52:26.273
You remember Kyle Whitlock?

52:28.406 --> 52:29.929
How about Sean?

52:30.843 --> 52:32.149
You remember him?

52:35.935 --> 52:37.371
It was an accident.

52:50.819 --> 52:52.169
You motherfucker.

52:52.343 --> 52:54.083
Oh shit.

52:57.609 --> 53:00.525
You motherfucker,
you'’re gonna fucking fry.

53:00.699 --> 53:02.179
You want anymore?

53:02.353 --> 53:03.832
Do you want it?

53:17.150 --> 53:18.891
Fuck you.No.

53:21.937 --> 53:23.591
He lied once.

53:27.116 --> 53:28.553
Don'’t do it again.

53:30.337 --> 53:34.167
Tell me, what really happened
on July 25th?

53:34.994 --> 53:36.213
Tell me!

53:59.061 --> 54:00.628
Go, go, go!

54:25.740 --> 54:27.438
Hey, hey, hey!Get the fuck down!

54:33.095 --> 54:34.227
These are kids.

54:34.401 --> 54:35.794
These aren'’t our guys.

54:37.839 --> 54:40.929
Put your fucking
hands in the air!

54:43.628 --> 54:45.717
What is that?

54:51.462 --> 54:53.072
It'’s a fucking duplex.

54:53.246 --> 54:55.248
It'’s the wrong
fucking place, man.

54:55.422 --> 54:57.468
Wrong fucking address.Fuck.

54:58.860 --> 55:00.775
All right, come on, come on.
Let'’s go, let'’s go.

55:06.477 --> 55:09.306
I want you to say his name.

55:14.485 --> 55:15.790
Say his name!

55:16.965 --> 55:20.752
Kyle. Kyle Whitlock.

55:20.926 --> 55:22.580
That'’s right.

55:22.754 --> 55:27.933
Kyle Whitlock.He had a-- He had a gun.

55:28.107 --> 55:30.849
He had a gun
to protect himself.

55:33.982 --> 55:36.855
You fucked everything up.

55:37.029 --> 55:38.204
Everything.

55:46.343 --> 55:47.822
Piece of shit.

55:49.824 --> 55:52.479
Hey, you listen.
Hey, hey, you listen to me.

55:53.393 --> 55:55.047
You can hurt me.

55:56.396 --> 55:59.007
But if you touch her,
I swear to God,

56:00.444 --> 56:03.055
I will go to my grave
with my thumbs in your eyes.

56:03.229 --> 56:05.840
You'’re not in a position
to fucking say anything.

56:09.931 --> 56:11.542
Don'’t-- Don'’t, please.

56:11.716 --> 56:14.066
I got a baby.
I got a baby coming.

56:15.720 --> 56:18.636
Please, I got a little girl.

56:19.550 --> 56:21.073
No.

56:21.247 --> 56:23.380
Change your ways.

56:26.557 --> 56:28.776
You change your fucking ways

56:28.950 --> 56:31.300
or I'’m putting the right one
in your head.

56:35.392 --> 56:37.132
Tell me what I want to hear!

56:39.874 --> 56:41.572
Okay, fine.

56:43.574 --> 56:46.664
I'’m sorry,
that what you want to hear?

56:49.362 --> 56:52.539
Hey, I can get you a plane,
all right?

56:52.713 --> 56:54.672
I can get you a plane,
I can get you out of here.

56:54.846 --> 56:57.588
I can get you money,
I can get you whatever you need.
What do you want?

57:03.811 --> 57:05.726
Is that what it is?

57:05.900 --> 57:07.293
Sorry.

57:07.467 --> 57:09.382
Yes, I'’m sure you are.

57:11.819 --> 57:13.691
Everybody'’s sorry.

57:15.997 --> 57:17.651
He was a good boy.

57:19.392 --> 57:21.307
And you took him away.

57:29.402 --> 57:31.273
You killed one son.

57:33.145 --> 57:35.321
And you locked the other one up.

57:39.194 --> 57:40.892
No!

57:43.808 --> 57:45.462
No!

57:47.681 --> 57:50.336
Move her out of the way.
I'’m not done yet.

58:02.304 --> 58:06.570
You-- You'’re a monster!

58:11.488 --> 58:13.272
No!

58:16.754 --> 58:17.842
No!

58:18.625 --> 58:20.018
No!

58:21.193 --> 58:22.499
No!

58:38.558 --> 58:40.647
Feed him to the gators.

58:45.957 --> 58:47.698
Rogue hostage?

58:50.788 --> 58:53.660
Last I heard
he was cornered
at the top of the plant.

58:55.357 --> 58:58.491
Good, good job.

59:02.190 --> 59:04.410
You have to know
he'’s lost it, right?

59:05.977 --> 59:08.109
I mean, is this going
the way you thought it would?

59:08.283 --> 59:09.937
The way that he said it would?

59:12.897 --> 59:16.204
I think he told you one thing.
I think he told you to come in,
guns a-blazing,

59:16.378 --> 59:18.772
get some revenge,
get paid,

59:18.946 --> 59:21.296
but that only the bad people
would get hurt.

59:23.385 --> 59:25.387
Does that sound about right?

59:26.519 --> 59:27.651
Shut up.

59:29.043 --> 59:30.392
It'’s not going that way, is it?

59:31.393 --> 59:34.005
I said, shut up.

59:39.663 --> 59:44.232
Did you know that
years after Katrina,

59:44.406 --> 59:47.235
there are families that
are still trying to
get back on their feet.

59:47.409 --> 59:49.194
I know what it means.

59:51.979 --> 59:53.546
I know what it means.

59:55.200 --> 59:56.897
Oh man.

59:57.071 --> 59:59.247
It'’s just too dangerous.

59:59.421 --> 1:00:02.642
Did you just see
what I just saw?
This guy'’s out of his mind.

1:00:02.816 --> 1:00:04.470
There'’s no telling
how many people
he'’s gonna kill.

1:00:04.644 --> 1:00:06.428
Moving them is a risk.

1:00:06.603 --> 1:00:10.432
Staying here is a risk.

1:00:10.607 --> 1:00:13.566
Now, I can get them kids
on the bus and get '’em
out of here.

1:00:15.002 --> 1:00:16.438
Who'’s gonna drive the bus?

1:00:42.377 --> 1:00:43.552
Fuck.

1:01:33.646 --> 1:01:35.561
I really need to
use the bathroom.

1:01:35.735 --> 1:01:37.824
Listen, no.Hey, hey, hey.

1:01:38.651 --> 1:01:39.826
Now go.

1:02:05.591 --> 1:02:07.593
Shut up and don'’t move!

1:02:07.767 --> 1:02:10.727
Okay, okay, I'’m going,
I'’m going, I'’m going.

1:02:18.082 --> 1:02:19.518
Ah, my nose.

1:02:29.702 --> 1:02:31.269
Who'’s the man?

1:02:40.887 --> 1:02:42.584
Yeah, who'’s the man?

1:02:42.759 --> 1:02:44.891
I'’m the motherfucking man,
baby.

1:02:45.065 --> 1:02:47.024
Y'’all good? Everybody okay?

1:02:47.198 --> 1:02:49.330
Let'’s go, come on.
Let'’s go, let'’s go, let'’s go!

1:02:49.504 --> 1:02:51.289
Hurry up, get in the bus.
Let'’s go, let'’s go!

1:02:51.463 --> 1:02:54.466
Come on, let'’s go.
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1:02:54.640 --> 1:02:56.163
Let'’s go, here we go.

1:02:56.337 --> 1:02:57.948
Yes!Let'’s go.

1:03:20.666 --> 1:03:23.800
All the way to the back.Here we go.
Get on the bus, here we go.

1:03:27.673 --> 1:03:28.805
I'’ll be damned.

1:03:30.197 --> 1:03:31.416
Here we go.

1:03:34.854 --> 1:03:36.769
Hey, yo, Mack,
this is Blaylock.

1:03:36.943 --> 1:03:39.641
I'’m on the move,
heading over there now.

1:03:40.425 --> 1:03:43.776
Uh, kids, gentlemen.

1:03:43.950 --> 1:03:46.561
What I need you to do is,
I need you to get up.

1:03:46.735 --> 1:03:48.868
So I need everyone
to stand up, come on.

1:03:52.959 --> 1:03:55.309
Boone, both hostage teams
aren'’t checking in

1:03:55.483 --> 1:03:56.789
and Mack can'’t be found
on the plant.

1:03:56.963 --> 1:03:58.791
Shit. Watch him.

1:04:16.069 --> 1:04:17.984
It'’s okay, come on.

1:04:31.868 --> 1:04:34.000
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on.

1:04:38.570 --> 1:04:39.788
Come on.

1:04:39.963 --> 1:04:41.747
Let'’s go, let'’s go, come on.

1:04:41.921 --> 1:04:43.618
Come on, come on.

1:04:48.710 --> 1:04:50.364
Let'’s go, let'’s go.

1:04:59.678 --> 1:05:02.681
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, get out.

1:05:20.394 --> 1:05:22.396
Oh, come on.

1:05:23.920 --> 1:05:25.660
Get this over with.

1:05:55.734 --> 1:05:57.083
Oh, fuck.

1:06:01.827 --> 1:06:03.394
Stop right there.

1:06:04.786 --> 1:06:06.266
You know the drill.

1:06:11.880 --> 1:06:13.491
Move.

1:06:13.665 --> 1:06:14.927
Move!

1:06:27.679 --> 1:06:29.550
Fuck, Mack!

1:06:29.724 --> 1:06:31.596
You. You, Boone?

1:06:31.770 --> 1:06:33.119
You'’re a part of all this shit?

1:06:33.293 --> 1:06:35.426
You weren'’t
supposed to be here.

1:06:35.600 --> 1:06:37.080
Oh, that'’s right.

1:06:37.254 --> 1:06:38.690
That'’s right,
the bar last night.

1:06:38.864 --> 1:06:40.735
I should have known
something was wrong

1:06:40.909 --> 1:06:42.824
the minute you said
you was buying.

1:06:44.478 --> 1:06:46.698
Come on, tell me. Why?

1:06:46.872 --> 1:06:48.830
They killed
his fucking kid, Mack.

1:06:49.005 --> 1:06:51.007
What, they killed his kid,
so you'’re gonna blow a dam

1:06:51.181 --> 1:06:52.704
and kill 100,000 people?

1:06:52.878 --> 1:06:54.401
It wasn'’t supposed to
go down like that!

1:06:54.575 --> 1:06:57.013
Well, how the fuck
was it supposed to go down?

1:06:57.187 --> 1:06:59.406
You took a fucking oath

1:06:59.580 --> 1:07:01.191
to protect this country

1:07:01.365 --> 1:07:04.585
against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

1:07:06.631 --> 1:07:07.936
Against who?

1:07:08.850 --> 1:07:10.287
People like you.

1:07:12.550 --> 1:07:14.378
Oh, brother.

1:07:19.470 --> 1:07:21.167
Do the right thing, man.

1:07:22.777 --> 1:07:24.431
Not a good look.

1:07:45.365 --> 1:07:48.238
No, no, no, Sophia,
you'’re supposed to be
on the bus.

1:07:48.412 --> 1:07:49.935
Now what are you doing here?

1:07:50.109 --> 1:07:51.806
I ain'’t gonna leave you.

1:07:51.980 --> 1:07:53.547
That was not part of the plan.

1:07:53.721 --> 1:07:55.201
And you'’re supposed to
be with Blaylock.

1:07:55.375 --> 1:07:56.550
You'’re supposed to be safe.

1:07:56.724 --> 1:07:59.553
Okay, so now what?I don'’t know.

1:08:01.425 --> 1:08:03.949
I know.
The security hub,

1:08:04.123 --> 1:08:07.692
maybe Cranbrook'’s not with them.
Let'’s go.

1:08:20.357 --> 1:08:23.316
Killing that cop didn'’t feel
as good as you thought, did it?

1:08:26.276 --> 1:08:28.974
We gotta end this, Ron.

1:08:29.148 --> 1:08:33.196
We got passports, new names.
We can get the hell out,
call this a wash.

1:08:36.373 --> 1:08:40.551
That cop looked at me
square in the eyes

1:08:41.247 --> 1:08:42.640
and he lied.

1:08:44.250 --> 1:08:45.730
How do you know that?

1:08:48.907 --> 1:08:51.388
I thought you were
with us the whole time.

1:08:51.562 --> 1:08:53.651
Never figured you
for a fucking psycho.

1:08:55.914 --> 1:08:57.220
Come on, man.

1:08:57.394 --> 1:08:59.047
And I...

1:09:01.789 --> 1:09:06.054
need your strength...

1:09:07.230 --> 1:09:09.710
and how you'’re gonna help me,

1:09:09.884 --> 1:09:12.626
and how you'’re gonna
fucking help me bring along--

1:09:12.800 --> 1:09:14.454
You'’re going to fucking help,
all right?Listen--

1:09:14.628 --> 1:09:16.326
Listen,
we go a way back, okay?

1:09:16.500 --> 1:09:18.676
Yeah, damn straight.

1:09:18.850 --> 1:09:21.331
And you know,
I'’d do anything for you.
Anything in the world.

1:09:21.505 --> 1:09:23.985
But I didn'’t think
you'’d escalate
this shit to this degree.

1:09:24.160 --> 1:09:26.205
I mean, come on, man.
Take the L.

1:09:28.076 --> 1:09:29.426
He didn'’t know they were cops.

1:09:29.600 --> 1:09:31.123
How do you know that?

1:09:33.081 --> 1:09:36.824
What if your son
was the one that lied?

1:09:36.998 --> 1:09:40.741
And what if the cops
did identify themselves?
And what if he shot first?

1:09:40.915 --> 1:09:42.874
He didn'’t shoot first.

1:09:43.048 --> 1:09:44.571
How do you know?

1:09:44.745 --> 1:09:47.052
'’Cause I know my son.

1:09:51.578 --> 1:09:54.755
Well, to prove it, it doesn'’t
mean you have to kill every
motherfucker swinging dick

1:09:54.929 --> 1:09:56.757
that had something to do
with it, does it?

1:10:00.631 --> 1:10:02.285
Answer me this.

1:10:02.459 --> 1:10:07.072
Did we find who was
related to Larry Rakestraw?

1:10:08.856 --> 1:10:10.641
Amy Rakestraw.

1:10:13.165 --> 1:10:14.732
Listen, apple pie.

1:10:14.906 --> 1:10:17.996
Why? You like '’em feisty
or some bullshit like that?

1:10:18.170 --> 1:10:19.693
Yeah, something like that.

1:10:33.664 --> 1:10:36.014
Cranbrook?Mack.

1:10:37.102 --> 1:10:39.539
Quite a mood this morning,
brother.

1:10:39.713 --> 1:10:41.846
Don'’t tell me you in on
all this shit.

1:10:42.020 --> 1:10:44.152
Come on, Mack. You know
me better than that, but--

1:10:47.591 --> 1:10:49.506
This town'’s gone crazy.

1:10:49.680 --> 1:10:52.204
I played football in high school
with this guy.

1:10:53.988 --> 1:10:55.686
You okay?Yeah.

1:10:55.860 --> 1:10:57.644
He always gave me
the heebie-jeebies.

1:11:04.216 --> 1:11:07.480
Open another gate, now.

1:11:24.584 --> 1:11:27.935
If you'’re coming
out of Cherokee County,
stay at home.

1:11:28.109 --> 1:11:32.810
Reports are coming in
the hydroelectric dam is not
able to keep the gates working.

1:11:38.555 --> 1:11:39.686
Sit.

1:11:40.905 --> 1:11:43.821
So I assume you know
why we'’re here.

1:11:47.041 --> 1:11:49.827
And here I was thinking
you had good intel.

1:11:52.133 --> 1:11:54.353
Detective Rakestraw.

1:11:58.444 --> 1:11:59.967
You'’re not related to him?

1:12:01.621 --> 1:12:05.408
Unfortunately, that feckless
piece of shit is my brother.

1:12:06.713 --> 1:12:08.236
Stepbrother.

1:12:08.411 --> 1:12:11.501
So my intel was spot on.

1:12:13.285 --> 1:12:17.115
But if you think that no account
son of a bitch is gonna come
running down here

1:12:17.289 --> 1:12:18.986
just '’cause I call him,

1:12:19.160 --> 1:12:21.598
your intel'’s for shit, hoss.

1:12:22.250 --> 1:12:23.513
Is that right?

1:12:24.470 --> 1:12:27.691
He'’s a low-life, dirty cop.

1:12:27.865 --> 1:12:30.389
Shit, he'’s probably
worse than Fulbright.

1:12:30.563 --> 1:12:32.565
Fulbright, he was just roped in
on this whole damn thing.

1:12:32.739 --> 1:12:34.219
He'’s nothing but a follower.

1:12:34.393 --> 1:12:37.353
He'’s just loyal to a fault.

1:12:44.751 --> 1:12:46.449
I got that feeling.

1:12:48.929 --> 1:12:55.022
Most people in this town
think it was bullshit
what happened to Kyle.

1:12:56.328 --> 1:13:00.680
Kid, he stayed to himself,
never bothered anyone.

1:13:00.854 --> 1:13:04.249
Went to school.
I didn'’t know him. But...

1:13:06.033 --> 1:13:09.820
But he seemed like
a real good kid.

1:13:09.994 --> 1:13:14.825
But there are better ways
to get justice than this.

1:13:16.304 --> 1:13:18.655
I wish that were true.

1:13:20.483 --> 1:13:22.441
I live in the real world.

1:13:22.615 --> 1:13:25.618
Which is why you should know
just as good as anybody

1:13:25.792 --> 1:13:30.710
that bad, god-awful shit
happens to good people

1:13:30.884 --> 1:13:32.582
all the damn time.

1:13:32.756 --> 1:13:35.193
But the difference between
you and them

1:13:35.367 --> 1:13:37.195
is that you think the answer
to the fact

1:13:37.369 --> 1:13:39.763
is to just wash it all away.

1:13:45.072 --> 1:13:46.683
I like you, Amy.

1:13:52.515 --> 1:13:54.517
I hate to have to kill you.

1:13:58.390 --> 1:14:00.131
Call the detective now.

1:14:10.837 --> 1:14:15.233
I bet you a million bucks
I ain'’t got,
this dickhead don'’t answer.

1:14:29.726 --> 1:14:32.076
Did you cut it off
or cut it back on?

1:14:35.166 --> 1:14:37.429
Well, how long did you
leave it off?

1:14:39.736 --> 1:14:41.433
Well, sweetie--

1:14:50.660 --> 1:14:54.359
Look, I think we reached
the apex to my knowledge
of the subject of your Wi-Fi.

1:14:54.533 --> 1:14:56.796
No, I know we have.

1:14:56.970 --> 1:15:01.018
I gotta go, I gotta go.
Babe, we'’ll look at it
when I get home.

1:15:10.201 --> 1:15:12.899
Well, howdy, officers.
I don'’t have my driving license,

1:15:13.073 --> 1:15:15.772
but I got a bus here of kids
that need some help now.

1:15:16.947 --> 1:15:18.818
Jesus Christ.

1:15:18.992 --> 1:15:20.037
Again.

1:15:29.655 --> 1:15:31.527
Get an ambulance for the driver.

1:15:31.701 --> 1:15:33.746
Call these kids'’ parents.Let'’s go!

1:15:33.920 --> 1:15:35.748
Calm down,
we got you, calm down.

1:15:35.922 --> 1:15:39.143
Calm down? I just told you
there'’s a bus full of kids.

1:15:39.317 --> 1:15:41.101
I'’m pretty sure I know
why you'’re calling.

1:15:41.275 --> 1:15:43.451
Do you have the phone?

1:15:43.626 --> 1:15:45.889
Yeah,
and you need to come alone.

1:15:46.063 --> 1:15:49.066
Amy, hey, Amy.
Hang up the the phone
'’cause we need help!

1:15:52.896 --> 1:15:54.158
He'’s on his way.

1:15:56.464 --> 1:15:58.031
Outstanding.

1:16:10.130 --> 1:16:11.392
Mack Karr!

1:16:12.219 --> 1:16:14.047
Drop the gun.

1:16:20.924 --> 1:16:22.403
You must be Gator.

1:16:23.404 --> 1:16:25.189
Yeah, I bet
you'’re a big Florida fan.

1:16:25.363 --> 1:16:27.495
No. Bulldogs.

1:16:27.670 --> 1:16:30.020
No shit, me too.

1:16:30.194 --> 1:16:32.979
Yeah, I'’ve been
waiting for this.

1:17:07.623 --> 1:17:11.496
I'’m gonna get you Mack Karr.

1:17:51.884 --> 1:17:53.799
NSA Security,
this is Skip.

1:17:53.973 --> 1:17:59.239
Skip, Officer Bledsoe,
Fitzgerald Chief of Police.Okay.

1:17:59.413 --> 1:18:03.983
We met at that mixer thing
at the Civic Center, where you
all walked us through the--

1:18:04.157 --> 1:18:09.510
Oh yeah, it wasn'’t really
a mixer. It was more of a
safety protocol seminar, but...

1:18:09.685 --> 1:18:13.427
Yeah, well I just want to let
you know that your safety
protocols are for shit, hoss.

1:18:14.777 --> 1:18:16.082
Excuse me?

1:18:16.256 --> 1:18:17.693
Copy that.

1:18:26.527 --> 1:18:27.790
Hey.

1:18:29.400 --> 1:18:30.967
Easy there, Eastwood.

1:18:31.141 --> 1:18:34.187
Did you get him?No.

1:18:34.361 --> 1:18:37.800
Bunch of assholes out there
trying to interfere with me.

1:18:37.974 --> 1:18:40.672
Check it out.

1:18:40.846 --> 1:18:45.808
Rakestraw. What the hell is
going on? Why are these cops
showing up one by one?

1:18:45.982 --> 1:18:47.897
First Fulbright, now him.

1:18:48.071 --> 1:18:49.855
I'’m sure Blaylock drove
straight to the police station.

1:18:50.029 --> 1:18:52.945
Right, right,
so if the police know--

1:18:53.119 --> 1:18:55.382
NSA knows.So where the hell are they?

1:18:56.688 --> 1:18:58.777
They sure are taking their
sweet-ass time getting here.

1:18:58.951 --> 1:19:02.738
I gotta figure out a way
to get in that control room
and stop this fool.

1:19:05.653 --> 1:19:07.786
I'’ll be back.I'’m coming with you.

1:19:08.569 --> 1:19:09.875
Oh no, you'’re not.

1:19:10.049 --> 1:19:13.400
Mack, I can help you
shut the dam down.

1:19:13.574 --> 1:19:15.620
Sophia, no, you are not.

1:19:24.803 --> 1:19:27.501
You'’re a detective now?

1:19:31.679 --> 1:19:36.510
Your sister confirmed
what I already know.

1:19:36.684 --> 1:19:38.295
I bet she did.

1:19:39.949 --> 1:19:41.428
We'’re in agreement.

1:19:43.953 --> 1:19:49.915
You are the sorriest
sack of shit
in the whole damn county.

1:19:50.089 --> 1:19:52.831
You wouldn'’t have
the whole truth

1:19:53.005 --> 1:19:54.702
if it bit you on the ass.

1:19:56.182 --> 1:19:58.576
Let'’s just say I beg to differ.

1:20:00.273 --> 1:20:02.362
Sorry to keep everybody waiting.

1:20:02.536 --> 1:20:06.453
Ron Whitlock,
former head of security,
Fitzgerald Hydroelectric.

1:20:06.627 --> 1:20:08.804
And from what I can tell,
there'’s a rogue hostage with

1:20:08.978 --> 1:20:12.764
some sort of military
background who has helped us
to free the kids.

1:20:12.938 --> 1:20:16.115
Or else the whole dam
might already be under water.

1:20:16.289 --> 1:20:20.816
It is my high recommendation
we make this a full-scale
military operation.

1:20:20.990 --> 1:20:24.297
We get in, secure the facility,
and get out.

1:20:24.471 --> 1:20:26.647
Is that understood?

1:21:16.175 --> 1:21:19.483
I'’m a cop.
Don'’t fucking shoot me.

1:21:19.657 --> 1:21:21.877
They'’re gonna
fucking kill you, man.

1:21:24.923 --> 1:21:26.446
Where are they?

1:21:26.620 --> 1:21:28.405
Get to the manual overdrive.

1:21:29.449 --> 1:21:31.060
Go, go, go.

1:21:43.986 --> 1:21:46.684
Let me guess, Gator.

1:21:46.858 --> 1:21:50.731
You mama name you that
or come up with it on your own?

1:21:50.906 --> 1:21:53.473
Well, why don'’t you
come out here and find out?

1:21:54.779 --> 1:21:56.433
I'’m out of ammo.

1:21:58.304 --> 1:21:59.958
Mano a mano.

1:22:01.394 --> 1:22:03.396
Hand to hand, man to man?

1:22:04.267 --> 1:22:05.790
You got it.

1:22:14.451 --> 1:22:15.626
Motherfucker.

1:22:22.285 --> 1:22:25.592
Sorry, dude,
got a town to save.

1:22:35.254 --> 1:22:36.777
I'’m hearing chatter.

1:22:37.953 --> 1:22:40.259
What kind of chatter?

1:22:40.433 --> 1:22:42.696
My guess is
the NSA'’s been mobilized.
We gotta go.

1:22:42.870 --> 1:22:44.655
Like hell.

1:22:45.873 --> 1:22:48.093
Listen, man, we tried,
this is over.

1:22:48.267 --> 1:22:49.747
We-- We can'’t.

1:22:50.748 --> 1:22:52.837
You don'’t fucking do anything

1:22:53.011 --> 1:22:55.318
unless I'’m fucking talking
about that.

1:22:55.492 --> 1:22:57.973
Do you understand that?
I'’m calling the shots.

1:22:58.147 --> 1:23:01.019
Me, that'’s it, that'’s it.

1:23:01.193 --> 1:23:03.543
I don'’t wanna have
any problems from you.

1:23:06.198 --> 1:23:08.766
Let'’s just wash
the whole thing away.

1:23:08.940 --> 1:23:11.987
Smith, open another gate.

1:23:13.336 --> 1:23:15.555
Hey! Now!

1:23:42.800 --> 1:23:44.845
Think about what you'’re doing.

1:23:45.020 --> 1:23:47.283
I mean, do you even care
that you are gonna

1:23:47.457 --> 1:23:49.415
completely destroy
an entire county?

1:23:49.589 --> 1:23:51.156
Just shut up.

1:23:52.940 --> 1:23:55.073
This is not gonna
end well for you.

1:23:55.247 --> 1:23:58.555
You don'’t give a shit
about anybody but yourself.

1:24:07.955 --> 1:24:09.653
That is beautiful.

1:24:12.221 --> 1:24:15.354
You just want to see
this whole place
wash away, right?

1:24:17.182 --> 1:24:19.750
We'’re all gonna drown, Jesus!

1:24:21.969 --> 1:24:24.276
Boone, we gotta go.

1:24:25.451 --> 1:24:27.192
We can'’t leave these people.

1:24:27.888 --> 1:24:29.977
We can and we will.

1:24:32.067 --> 1:24:35.766
You gotta close the gate.I can'’t let that happen.

1:24:35.940 --> 1:24:37.985
Close the fucking gate!

1:24:38.160 --> 1:24:43.991
I only wanted one cop
to admit that they fucked up.

1:24:46.298 --> 1:24:48.039
And they can'’t do it.

1:24:49.997 --> 1:24:52.696
They'’d rather
destroy their town

1:24:52.870 --> 1:24:54.872
than clear my son'’s name.

1:24:56.830 --> 1:24:59.268
Well, now you'’ve killed
them all, so it'’s on you.

1:24:59.442 --> 1:25:02.097
I'’ll bear that burden.

1:25:04.490 --> 1:25:06.449
It'’s what makes me different.

1:25:12.716 --> 1:25:14.109
I'’ll own it!

1:25:21.899 --> 1:25:23.379
Get him out of here.

1:26:03.984 --> 1:26:07.553
Now-- Now y'’all pissing me off.

1:26:10.513 --> 1:26:13.472
Oh, man, I hate this thing.

1:26:37.148 --> 1:26:38.802
Team, deploy.

1:26:42.719 --> 1:26:44.199
Move, move, move!

1:26:44.373 --> 1:26:46.940
Deploy west, B Team.Move, move!

1:26:48.464 --> 1:26:50.117
Go, go!

1:26:57.342 --> 1:27:00.432
Move to side entrance,
go, go.

1:27:07.222 --> 1:27:10.964
It'’s over, Ron.
You make a move,
slim, the boss gets it.

1:27:12.879 --> 1:27:15.795
That'’s me.

1:27:15.969 --> 1:27:19.712
Rogue hostage, rogue welder,
rogue just about everything.

1:27:21.105 --> 1:27:24.108
You look it.Thanks.

1:27:24.282 --> 1:27:27.372
I read your file, I served also.

1:27:27.546 --> 1:27:31.246
Yeah, no shit.
Kind of figured that part
out on my own, man.

1:27:32.334 --> 1:27:34.161
I thought all this
meant something.

1:27:41.125 --> 1:27:42.169
Move your ass!

1:27:50.700 --> 1:27:52.702
You'’ll kill everybody, you know.

1:27:59.622 --> 1:28:01.667
Even if you can control
the flood.

1:28:02.712 --> 1:28:04.235
Yeah, I know.

1:28:05.715 --> 1:28:07.630
I read your story, man.

1:28:07.804 --> 1:28:09.632
I know what'’s got you
all riled up.

1:28:09.806 --> 1:28:13.244
No, no, no, I'’m not.

1:28:13.418 --> 1:28:17.683
A friend of mine was there
that day who saw what really
happened with your son.

1:28:20.904 --> 1:28:22.775
He says he'’s innocent, man.

1:28:23.863 --> 1:28:25.387
Bullshit.

1:28:25.561 --> 1:28:28.564
I swear it, soldier to soldier.

1:28:31.349 --> 1:28:33.046
Come on, man.

1:28:33.220 --> 1:28:35.658
Fucking come on, Ron.
Call '’em off, man.

1:28:35.832 --> 1:28:37.747
Where is this guy
you were talking about?

1:28:37.921 --> 1:28:39.226
I know where
to find him.

1:28:39.401 --> 1:28:43.013
And I promise you,
if you call off your men,

1:28:43.187 --> 1:28:46.059
I will make sure that
his story gets out there.

1:28:49.019 --> 1:28:50.977
I heard that before too.

1:28:51.761 --> 1:28:53.502
Fuck!

1:28:56.156 --> 1:28:57.810
Come on, come on.

1:28:59.551 --> 1:29:00.639
Come on.

1:29:01.814 --> 1:29:03.207
Fuck. Fuck!

1:29:03.381 --> 1:29:05.818
You need to close them
fucking gates right now.

1:29:06.645 --> 1:29:08.343
Gates stay open.

1:29:08.517 --> 1:29:11.520
Tell that bitch to stop trying
or Smith will be next.

1:29:12.825 --> 1:29:14.436
Shit.

1:29:21.704 --> 1:29:25.795
Sophia, listen to me,
do not close the gates.
They are going to kill me.

1:29:25.969 --> 1:29:29.102
Take your hands off the wheel,
do you understand?

1:29:29.276 --> 1:29:30.800
Are you serious?

1:29:30.974 --> 1:29:33.237
They'’re gonna flood
the entire county.

1:29:33.411 --> 1:29:35.718
No, we have to close the gates.

1:29:36.414 --> 1:29:37.850
Are you serious?

1:29:38.024 --> 1:29:39.722
Asshole!

1:29:39.896 --> 1:29:41.376
Ugh!

1:29:57.522 --> 1:30:00.525
Hands up,
the power'’s being shut down.

1:30:04.399 --> 1:30:06.488
Close the fucking gates!

1:30:10.883 --> 1:30:12.015
Don'’t shoot!

1:30:12.189 --> 1:30:13.930
Surrender, surrender.

1:30:14.104 --> 1:30:15.932
No, don'’t shoot.
Don'’t shoot, Ron.

1:30:16.106 --> 1:30:17.847
Tell your men to
put the gun down.

1:30:18.021 --> 1:30:19.239
Come on, man.

1:30:20.153 --> 1:30:22.808
Ron. This is no way to go out.

1:30:24.157 --> 1:30:26.333
Come on, man, put the gun down.

1:30:26.508 --> 1:30:28.640
Put the gun down, it'’s over.

1:30:30.294 --> 1:30:34.559
Come on, man.
This is no way to go out.

1:30:35.821 --> 1:30:37.083
It'’s over.

1:30:37.257 --> 1:30:40.696
Just make sure that
my son gets out.

1:30:43.655 --> 1:30:46.441
Soldier to soldier, okay?

1:31:29.919 --> 1:31:32.182
As Fitzgerald County
tries to heal

1:31:32.356 --> 1:31:35.707
after last week'’s
dam hijacking,
all eyes turn towards

1:31:35.881 --> 1:31:38.101
the wrongful death case
that sources say

1:31:38.275 --> 1:31:39.798
caused the incident.

1:31:39.972 --> 1:31:41.757
Following new
eyewitness testimony,

1:31:41.931 --> 1:31:45.456
Sean Whitlock has been released
and cleared of all charges.

1:31:45.630 --> 1:31:49.765
But he was back in court today,
as his brother'’s case is heard.

1:31:49.939 --> 1:31:52.637
Prosecutors hope
for a swift end to the case

1:31:52.811 --> 1:31:57.076
as the community will be
feeling the effects of that
fateful raid for some time.

1:31:58.382 --> 1:32:01.385
Whoa, look who it is,
Mack Karr.

1:32:01.559 --> 1:32:02.908
Chief of security now.

1:32:03.082 --> 1:32:04.257
Man, shut up, Blaylock.

1:32:04.431 --> 1:32:06.346
My man.No, no, no, the man.

1:32:06.521 --> 1:32:08.697
That'’s right, baby.That'’s what I'’m talking about.

1:32:08.871 --> 1:32:12.222
Trevor, must be struggling,
brother, here we go.
Come on now, Trevor.

1:32:36.899 --> 1:32:38.161
I love you.

1:32:38.335 --> 1:32:39.641
You do?

1:32:40.250 --> 1:32:42.382
Wow, that'’s nice.

1:33:02.968 --> 1:33:04.535
Come.

1:33:04.709 --> 1:33:06.711
Come on, baby. Calvin.

1:33:06.885 --> 1:33:09.627
Calvin.Calvin, come on, baby.

1:33:09.801 --> 1:33:11.890
Come on, baby, come on.

1:33:12.064 --> 1:33:13.370
Hey, you.

1:33:14.676 --> 1:33:16.460
Come on, Calvin, up, up, up.

1:33:16.634 --> 1:33:19.115
Oh, there we go.Yeah. So cute.
