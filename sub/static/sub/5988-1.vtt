WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:02.534
<i> Previously on</i> Reign...
I didn't murder anyone.

00:02.536 --> 00:04.336
You are suspected
of ungodly acts.

00:04.338 --> 00:06.472
Just don't let them drown me.

00:06.474 --> 00:08.007
BASH:
Black magic.

00:08.009 --> 00:09.775
To nurture what was
growing between us.

00:09.777 --> 00:10.776
We are linked.

00:10.778 --> 00:12.444
Stephan.

00:12.446 --> 00:14.146
MARY: Alive? Are
you sure? How?

00:14.148 --> 00:15.547
I believe the child's
death was a ruse.

00:15.549 --> 00:17.449
Catherine.

00:17.451 --> 00:19.418
MARY: You are
a heartless woman,

00:19.420 --> 00:21.020
abducting your son's child.

00:21.022 --> 00:23.422
FRANCIS: Return
to the decaying bosom

00:23.424 --> 00:25.624
of your true family the Medicis
or flee to the new lands.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.726
CATHERINE: Exile?
FRANCIS: I don't care,

00:27.728 --> 00:29.595
but you will never be welcome
at this court ever again.

00:29.597 --> 00:31.597
GUARD:
Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth.

00:31.599 --> 00:33.465
ELIZABETH:
<i> Catherine de Medici.</i>

00:33.467 --> 00:35.801
What a pleasure
to meet one so legendary.

00:35.803 --> 00:37.669
I've come to offer
you something--

00:37.671 --> 00:39.772
the destruction of
our mutual enemy,

00:39.774 --> 00:41.807
Mary, Queen of Scots.

00:41.809 --> 00:44.109
I will love you for
the rest of my life.

00:44.111 --> 00:45.477
And I will never
let you go again.

00:45.479 --> 00:47.413
FRANCIS:
<i> I'm dying?</i>

00:47.415 --> 00:49.515
Yes, you are.

00:51.419 --> 00:53.552
("Crystals"
by Of Monsters and Men playing)

01:03.764 --> 01:06.665
¶ I know ¶

01:06.667 --> 01:10.069
¶ I'll wither ¶

01:10.071 --> 01:13.672
¶ So peel away the bark ¶

01:13.674 --> 01:17.309
¶ 'Cause nothing ¶

01:18.312 --> 01:21.146
¶ Grows when it is dark ¶

01:21.148 --> 01:24.716
¶ In spite of all my fears ¶

01:24.718 --> 01:28.253
¶ I can see it all so clear ¶

01:28.255 --> 01:32.658
¶ I see it all so clear ¶

01:33.594 --> 01:36.462
¶ Whoa ¶

01:37.465 --> 01:40.466
¶ Cover your crystal eyes ¶

01:40.468 --> 01:45.704
¶ And feel the tones
that tremble down your spine ¶

01:46.707 --> 01:49.475
¶ Whoa ¶

01:50.511 --> 01:53.112
¶ Cover your crystal eyes ¶

01:53.114 --> 01:58.150
¶ And let your colors bleed
and blend with mine. ¶

02:06.494 --> 02:07.893
MARY:
Not again.

02:07.895 --> 02:10.596
Yes, again.

02:10.598 --> 02:12.264
And again.

02:12.266 --> 02:14.766
And again and again and again.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.338
Shall we go back to bed?

02:19.340 --> 02:21.173
Francis, we have more
important things to do

02:21.175 --> 02:22.741
than make love or build boats.

02:22.743 --> 02:25.744
"We"? You have been no help
with the boat at all.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.613
England is
still a threat.

02:27.615 --> 02:29.381
The nobles are still uneasy,

02:29.383 --> 02:31.683
shaken after the coup.
It failed.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.519
The privy council has called
for a meeting this afternoon.

02:33.521 --> 02:36.388
Well, you'd better start sanding
or we'll never make it.

02:36.390 --> 02:38.690
Francis, we are king and queen.

02:38.692 --> 02:41.527
We have important matters
to attend to.

02:41.529 --> 02:44.897
This... this is important.

02:44.899 --> 02:47.166
And this.

02:51.438 --> 02:54.273
Nothing is more important.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.194
It's not the bloodshed,
Your Majesty...

03:15.196 --> 03:16.628
ELIZABETH:
Correct, Lord William,

03:16.630 --> 03:18.463
as our troops
are not even there.

03:18.465 --> 03:20.866
It's the expense
of your Scottish cause,

03:20.868 --> 03:22.868
which many say is personal,

03:22.870 --> 03:24.670
designed more to undermine
Scotland's queen

03:24.672 --> 03:26.605
than secure our borders.

03:31.612 --> 03:35.214
There are many reasons to back
the Protestants in Scotland.

03:35.216 --> 03:36.715
You back their efforts
because they want

03:36.717 --> 03:38.217
Mary, their Catholic
queen, gone,

03:38.219 --> 03:39.618
a queen even English Catholics
believe

03:39.620 --> 03:41.353
has the right to your throne.
What next?

03:41.355 --> 03:42.988
Do we attack half
our population

03:42.990 --> 03:44.590
to put you at ease?

03:44.592 --> 03:46.425
The realm will strike down
anyone who acts

03:46.427 --> 03:47.693
against its
sovereign ruler.

03:47.695 --> 03:49.795
Is it not our sworn duty?

04:01.408 --> 04:03.575
(groans)

04:03.577 --> 04:06.311
Bad day on the
job, my dear?

04:06.313 --> 04:07.713
Half of England wants me gone.

04:07.715 --> 04:09.715
Only the Catholic half.
(scoffs)

04:09.717 --> 04:11.583
Well, the rest don't want Mary,

04:11.585 --> 04:13.252
but they certainly wish
I were a man.

04:13.254 --> 04:14.886
Of course they do, especially
your privy council.

04:14.888 --> 04:16.321
Here.

04:16.323 --> 04:19.658
Men don't like taking
orders from women.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.827
They can barely stand
speaking to them.

04:21.829 --> 04:23.662
Ah.

04:23.664 --> 04:25.764
You were nobody's
first choice,

04:25.766 --> 04:27.866
and yet here you are.

04:30.971 --> 04:33.605
You've been tense

04:33.607 --> 04:35.607
ever since Mary's
half brother, James,

04:35.609 --> 04:37.609
refused to push
for her abdication.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.544
So much for your plan.

04:39.546 --> 04:41.546
It had merit.

04:41.548 --> 04:44.549
If Mary couldn't even keep the
job of queen in her own nation,

04:44.551 --> 04:46.685
how could she be a good
candidate for yours?

04:46.687 --> 04:48.520
A better choice for stability?

04:48.522 --> 04:49.955
I think not.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.924
But there is another way
to dispose of her.

04:52.926 --> 04:54.326
I will not kill her.

04:54.328 --> 04:55.827
Neither would you.

04:55.829 --> 04:58.864
She's your cousin,
she's my daughter-in-law.

04:58.866 --> 05:00.766
And to kill a monarch,

05:00.768 --> 05:03.702
well, that's not a precedent
we want to set, now, is it?

05:03.704 --> 05:06.772
No, I speak of another way
for her to lose her throne.

05:06.774 --> 05:08.573
Disempower her.

05:08.575 --> 05:11.576
Do you know who empowers her?

05:11.578 --> 05:14.746
Her half brother,
her Catholic lords.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.315
Who finances her Catholic lords?

05:16.317 --> 05:18.750
Rome, the Vatican,

05:18.752 --> 05:21.887
with its thousand years of
tithing and vast stores of gold.

05:21.889 --> 05:23.855
Donated in the name of God,

05:23.857 --> 05:28.427
of goodness,
righteousness and purity.

05:28.429 --> 05:30.429
Those who the Vatican
support must uphold

05:30.431 --> 05:32.431
the tenets of the true faith.

05:32.433 --> 05:36.435
They must be unassailable,
or who is the Pope supporting?

05:36.437 --> 05:40.672
Are you suggesting there's a way
to turn the Pope against Mary?

05:46.480 --> 05:49.114
Just a few minutes more.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.418
Who are those people?

05:53.420 --> 05:54.786
I've invited a few guests

05:54.788 --> 05:56.788
to drop by from French court.

05:56.790 --> 05:59.358
Nobles, staff
loyal to me.

05:59.360 --> 06:02.861
I wanted to vet them
before they bear witness

06:02.863 --> 06:05.897
to Mary's infidelity
with Prince Condé.

06:05.899 --> 06:08.734
Bear witness... to the Pope.

06:08.736 --> 06:11.370
(chuckles)

06:11.372 --> 06:13.138
With your protection,

06:13.140 --> 06:15.841
I would like to ask them
to leave for Rome today.

06:15.843 --> 06:18.877
You're sending delegates to Rome

06:18.879 --> 06:22.147
to call Mary,
Queen of Scots...

06:22.149 --> 06:23.982
a whore.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.717
She'll be disgraced,

06:25.719 --> 06:28.754
forced by her own
countrymen off her throne

06:28.756 --> 06:32.457
and no longer capable
of reaching for yours.

06:35.629 --> 06:37.729
Your Majesties.

06:37.731 --> 06:40.699
Narcisse.

06:40.701 --> 06:43.101
I have some disturbing news
from a general aiding

06:43.103 --> 06:44.736
those loyal to Queen Mary
in Scotland.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.471
Your ear always
to the ground.

06:46.473 --> 06:47.906
I have learned to be grateful
for your spies,

06:47.908 --> 06:49.040
as you have
aided us in the past.

06:49.042 --> 06:50.876
Go on.

06:50.878 --> 06:52.644
Some of your Highland lords
have been turned.

06:52.646 --> 06:54.646
We have neither their armies
nor their territories

06:54.648 --> 06:57.416
allowing safe passage
to assist those besieged.

06:57.418 --> 07:01.052
Adding time and expense
to an already costly effort.

07:01.054 --> 07:03.121
The conflict rages on.

07:03.123 --> 07:04.790
And it will soon turn
against us.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.091
Yes.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.859
Unless significant funds
can be raised,

07:07.861 --> 07:09.828
men deployed, new lords bribed,

07:09.830 --> 07:13.965
then I predict that
Scotland will be lost.

07:13.967 --> 07:17.169
Mary, our military resources are
already near breaking point.

07:20.841 --> 07:23.108
There has to be a way.

07:31.752 --> 07:34.986
We're not the first
to turn to such resources.

07:34.988 --> 07:37.989
No, I'd say to Your Honor,
you're close to the last.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.057
To be clear,

07:39.059 --> 07:40.058
we're talking about...

07:40.060 --> 07:41.460
(animal roars, people gasp)

07:43.030 --> 07:44.596
...a pirate.

07:54.007 --> 07:55.073
Dear Lord.

07:55.075 --> 07:56.842
The privateer Martin de Lambert

07:56.844 --> 07:57.909
is here.

08:11.525 --> 08:15.527
MARTIN:
How is it that such a splendid
court lacks a menagerie?

08:15.529 --> 08:17.963
The rhinos and zebras
I can keep in a stable,

08:17.965 --> 08:20.599
but what of my tiger?
What about your ship?

08:20.601 --> 08:22.634
Her cage is being repaired--
she broke free.

08:22.636 --> 08:24.903
We caught her, but she tore
apart two of the cabins.

08:24.905 --> 08:26.171
I brought her as a gift for you.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.173
One, sadly, we cannot accept.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.241
About our offer...

08:29.243 --> 08:30.509
To steal gold
for you.

08:30.511 --> 08:31.710
I have requirements.

08:31.712 --> 08:32.978
Go on.

08:32.980 --> 08:34.613
50% of the profits,

08:34.615 --> 08:36.781
a small castle I'm rather
fond of in Cologne...

08:36.783 --> 08:38.283
You said as much in your letter.

08:38.285 --> 08:39.651
And your blessings
on a marriage.

08:39.653 --> 08:40.819
It's time for me to take a wife.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.087
All right.

08:42.089 --> 08:43.889
I've met your lady, Greer,

08:43.891 --> 08:46.124
and I think she
might do nicely.

08:47.995 --> 08:49.828
The issue with Lady Greer
is that...

08:49.830 --> 08:51.596
It's not negotiable.

08:53.267 --> 08:56.635
Out here again.
Hmm.

08:56.637 --> 08:59.204
You are careful not to walk
the grounds during the day.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.039
I'm careful in all things.

09:03.076 --> 09:05.710
Your French witnesses have
reached the Continent.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.746
Traveling south to Rome,

09:07.748 --> 09:10.749
through Bavaria,
avoiding France.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.217
Whether they succeed or fail,

09:12.219 --> 09:15.186
no one can know I've launched
such a personal campaign.

09:15.188 --> 09:18.189
Or that you're here.

09:18.191 --> 09:19.791
You needn't worry.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.793
Catherine de Medici
is in Tuscany,

09:21.795 --> 09:23.595
in an unwanted family home,

09:23.597 --> 09:25.597
attached to an
abandoned lumber mill.

09:25.599 --> 09:30.101
Reports that she does nothing
but weep and pray and rage

09:30.103 --> 09:31.937
drift back to
French court.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.638
You have a decoy.

09:33.640 --> 09:36.074
Even the servants
believe she's me.

09:36.076 --> 09:39.077
Her only neighbors
are some cloistered monks.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.812
(man moans sensually)

09:40.814 --> 09:42.714
CATHERINE:<i> No one</i>
<i> at French court will know</i>

09:42.716 --> 09:44.716
<i> that I am here in England.</i>

09:44.718 --> 09:47.085
<i> Your own secret weapon</i>
<i> against Mary, Queen of Scots.</i>

09:47.087 --> 09:50.655
The war between you
is personal, Elizabeth,

09:50.657 --> 09:52.123
and I will help you win it.

09:52.125 --> 09:54.025
MONK:
Oh, Catherine.

09:54.027 --> 09:55.327
(decoy speaks indistinctly)

10:01.602 --> 10:02.968
(both scream)

10:12.012 --> 10:14.112
Lord Dudley.

10:15.315 --> 10:17.248
Did anyone see you?

10:17.250 --> 10:18.917
No, when you dismiss
your servants,

10:18.919 --> 10:20.118
they know not to come back.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.621
You said we can't do this.

10:22.623 --> 10:24.122
We can't.

10:24.124 --> 10:26.057
Then don't force me
to be in your presence

10:26.059 --> 10:27.225
day in and day out.

10:28.996 --> 10:30.829
Let me hold you
in my arms, Elizabeth...

10:32.399 --> 10:34.232
...or let me leave court.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.134
I can't.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.969
I need you near.

10:37.971 --> 10:41.206
To see you even
if I can't touch you.

10:52.185 --> 10:54.419
WOMAN:
My dear husband,
there you are.

10:54.421 --> 10:57.155
They said you were meeting late
with the bursar.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.657
Is he troubling
the queen again?

10:58.659 --> 11:00.291
You needn't worry
about Elizabeth or me.

11:00.293 --> 11:01.893
You work too long.

11:01.895 --> 11:02.827
And Elizabeth,
she is so alone.

11:02.829 --> 11:03.962
So many against her.

11:03.963 --> 11:05.096
I want her to know
that we are with her,

11:05.098 --> 11:06.398
thinking of her always.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.700
I finished this today,

11:08.702 --> 11:10.001
to remind her
of just that.

11:10.003 --> 11:13.004
She does feel our love,
doesn't she, Robert?

11:13.006 --> 11:15.173
Amy, you shouldn't have.

11:17.844 --> 11:20.845
(laughter)

11:27.354 --> 11:28.953
Lady Lola.

11:28.955 --> 11:31.923
Lord Narcisse, I-I was just...

11:31.925 --> 11:33.958
Avoiding me, as you have
done for the past few weeks.

11:33.960 --> 11:36.027
You returned my gifts,
but please tell me

11:36.029 --> 11:38.229
you read my letters.
Nothing you say will
make me change my mind.

11:38.231 --> 11:41.032
I will not be seduced
into risking my life.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.702
Lola, please.

11:46.073 --> 11:48.206
I risked everything
to be free for you.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.041
Don't you see?
That's just the problem.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.743
Catherine knows
of your feelings for me.

11:51.745 --> 11:54.179
She is exiled,
banished from court.

11:54.181 --> 11:55.980
For how long?

11:55.982 --> 11:57.982
She's done terrible things
and been forgiven before.

11:57.984 --> 11:59.217
She is Francis' mother.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.953
If she returns, I
will protect you.

12:01.955 --> 12:04.189
And who will
protect me from you?

12:04.191 --> 12:06.791
You say you want
to court me,

12:06.793 --> 12:09.961
to do so honorably
with the truest of intentions...

12:09.963 --> 12:11.129
So you have read my letters.

12:11.131 --> 12:12.464
I hope you didn't skip
over the dirty bits.

12:12.466 --> 12:14.065
Stop it.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.168
You hurt me
to please your lover,

12:17.170 --> 12:19.170
and I know you'll try and
justify it, so let me be clear.

12:19.172 --> 12:22.373
The issue is this:
I fear you.

12:22.375 --> 12:25.310
You fear losing
yourself to a man

12:25.312 --> 12:27.312
because you've only
been with boys,

12:27.314 --> 12:29.214
and I include the
king on that list.

12:29.216 --> 12:33.384
Were you mine, I would protect
you with my life and much more.

12:33.386 --> 12:36.521
Your vengeful skills such as
blackmail, extortion, murder...

12:36.523 --> 12:38.456
Stop judging me and
admit the truth.

12:38.458 --> 12:42.393
I would never hurt you,
and you know that.

12:48.034 --> 12:49.234
What is it?

12:49.236 --> 12:51.236
Word on the
sorceress Delphine.

12:51.238 --> 12:52.771
Don't call her that.

12:52.773 --> 12:54.205
She's wanted
by the Crown for murder.

12:54.207 --> 12:55.406
Leave such superstitions
to the Church

12:55.408 --> 12:57.008
and tell me what you've learned.

12:57.010 --> 12:58.543
Multiple reports, many
of them conflicting.

12:58.545 --> 13:00.545
There was a
dark-haired beauty

13:00.547 --> 13:03.214
who took shelter in a farm
about a day's travel from here.

13:03.216 --> 13:05.183
Next morning, half the farmer's
cows took ill, many died.

13:05.185 --> 13:07.118
Animals get sick and spread
disease to one another,

13:07.120 --> 13:08.987
just as people do.

13:08.989 --> 13:10.488
And witches are known to
leave a trail of evil.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.123
They say when they're near,
birds fall from the sky.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.259
You said you had other leads.

13:14.261 --> 13:17.095
Another with dark hair, blue
eyes, caught stealing food.

13:17.097 --> 13:19.931
In her bag, they found
strange herbs and ointments,

13:19.933 --> 13:22.133
bloody rags, tools no
one could identify.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.169
She made a run for it,
but they caught her.

13:24.171 --> 13:25.303
Bound her to something.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.939
Yes, uh, she refused
to give her name.

13:27.941 --> 13:29.174
That's the lead to follow--
that's Delphine.

13:29.176 --> 13:31.142
You seem quite
sure, my lord.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.844
Just go.

13:42.355 --> 13:45.356
I suppose I should thank you
for not marrying me off.

13:45.358 --> 13:47.058
And to a privateer,
no less.

13:47.060 --> 13:48.893
Of course it was
out of the question--

13:48.895 --> 13:50.995
for many reasons, including
that you're still married.

13:50.997 --> 13:52.363
Did you tell him that?

13:52.365 --> 13:53.998
It's none of his business.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.834
Nor are the terms
of your estrangement.

13:55.836 --> 13:57.602
He clearly finds
you attractive.

13:57.604 --> 14:00.338
Mary, how dire is the
situation in Scotland?

14:00.340 --> 14:02.240
It's always dire, Greer.

14:02.242 --> 14:03.508
And the realm's
finances here?

14:03.510 --> 14:05.510
I have my own
business, Mary,

14:05.512 --> 14:07.178
I understand that
appearances matter,

14:07.180 --> 14:09.581
that a lavish lifestyle
is easier to maintain

14:09.583 --> 14:11.349
than thousands of soldiers
at home and abroad.

14:11.351 --> 14:15.086
We need to find additional
sources of income and quickly.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.254
Tell Martin he has
your blessing.

14:16.256 --> 14:18.323
What about your marriage?

14:18.325 --> 14:19.557
If he hears I'm married,

14:19.559 --> 14:21.292
imply there's an
annulment in the works.

14:21.294 --> 14:23.561
We won't even need
a long engagement,

14:23.563 --> 14:25.230
just one that extends
beyond his departure.

14:25.232 --> 14:27.298
But I'll break it off
once he delivers the gold.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.933
He picked you, Greer.

14:28.935 --> 14:31.369
You do realize
men fall at your feet?

14:31.371 --> 14:33.605
Stop.
All I'm saying is,

14:33.607 --> 14:37.175
he'll want your company
before he goes.

14:37.177 --> 14:39.010
A few days.

14:39.012 --> 14:40.311
What's the harm?

14:41.581 --> 14:44.616
People know of your
fondness for Dudley.

14:44.618 --> 14:48.253
I care for him as
I would a brother.

14:48.255 --> 14:51.022
We were locked in the tower
together when I was nothing.

14:51.024 --> 14:54.225
But enough of a threat to be
implicated in a treasonous plan.

14:54.227 --> 14:57.328
You spent many days together,
forging a deep bond.

14:57.330 --> 15:00.198
Is that when you became...

15:00.200 --> 15:01.566
close?

15:02.936 --> 15:06.070
I am a virgin queen.

15:09.276 --> 15:11.109
Of course you are.

15:11.111 --> 15:13.244
You have to be
as you are unwed.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.079
And Robert is already married.

15:15.081 --> 15:17.482
Anyway, he was too
lowborn for you,

15:17.484 --> 15:19.484
you being the
daughter of a king.

15:19.486 --> 15:21.386
Legitimate or illegitimate,

15:21.388 --> 15:24.055
royal blood flows
in your veins.

15:24.057 --> 15:27.258
And now it is time that you
found yourself a husband.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.560
What a novel idea.

15:29.562 --> 15:34.399
Well, the issue is that
if you marry a monarch,

15:34.401 --> 15:36.401
as befits your station,

15:36.403 --> 15:40.071
they will fault you for giving
a foreigner control of England.

15:40.073 --> 15:44.075
And any Englishman is obviously
beneath your station.

15:44.077 --> 15:47.078
I'd be marrying down,
diminishing my own standing.

15:47.080 --> 15:50.281
What if there was a candidate
who could raise your station

15:50.283 --> 15:52.283
by creating a
valuable alliance

15:52.285 --> 15:56.287
without threatening
you or your people?

15:56.289 --> 16:00.191
A husband who wouldn't even
be a threat to your lover?

16:02.062 --> 16:03.594
What kind
of husband is that?

16:03.596 --> 16:07.999
A boy-husband,
my son Charles.

16:08.001 --> 16:09.634
A prince.

16:09.636 --> 16:12.236
Wed him and you will have
your own alliance with France,

16:12.238 --> 16:14.238
leveling the playing
field with Mary.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.240
Your nobles want to ensure
that you provide heirs.

16:16.242 --> 16:19.077
This promises that
you will, in time.

16:19.079 --> 16:21.312
Well, once Charles is
anything less than petrified

16:21.314 --> 16:23.314
at the thought of
making love to you.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.450
Though I'm sure
you'd enthrall him.

16:25.452 --> 16:27.618
It's just that he might
not be much use to you

16:27.620 --> 16:30.421
in that department
for a year or two.

16:30.423 --> 16:32.323
He barely has a
whisker on his face.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.258
A year or two?

16:34.260 --> 16:36.094
Maybe three.

16:36.096 --> 16:39.097
Nearly a thousand days with
your lover, Robert Dudley.

16:39.099 --> 16:42.100
Francis would never allow it.

16:42.102 --> 16:45.536
It's obvious the union
would undercut Mary's power.

16:45.538 --> 16:48.039
It will come with an offer for
you to reduce your aggression

16:48.041 --> 16:49.741
in Scotland.

16:49.743 --> 16:51.542
And why would I do that?

16:51.544 --> 16:53.745
Because soon it won't matter.

16:53.747 --> 16:57.248
Once your delegation calls Mary
a whore before the Vatican.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.484
Scotland's queen will fall.

16:59.486 --> 17:02.153
A boy, you say?

17:04.591 --> 17:06.190
Any deformities?
None.

17:06.192 --> 17:08.493
Charles is very
handsome and gentle.

17:08.495 --> 17:10.728
I want to lay eyes
on him myself.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.530
Arrange the meeting.

17:23.209 --> 17:25.643
ELIZABETH:
<i> A wrinkle in our plan?</i>

17:25.645 --> 17:27.345
What kind of wrinkle?

17:27.347 --> 17:28.579
I sent word to the family

17:28.581 --> 17:30.348
that my son Charles
was staying with,

17:30.350 --> 17:31.783
and they said he left
for French court.

17:31.785 --> 17:33.651
Well, had he left on his
own or been called back?

17:33.653 --> 17:36.621
It's unclear, but the fact
is that if you had met him

17:36.623 --> 17:39.357
and approved and decided
to go ahead with this union,

17:39.359 --> 17:42.226
you'd have to reach out
formally to Francis anyway.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.462
Surely by now
Mary and Francis know

17:44.464 --> 17:46.464
that key lords have
turned against her.

17:46.466 --> 17:48.466
She can't keep this up.

17:48.468 --> 17:50.601
She's on the verge
of losing Scotland.

17:50.603 --> 17:53.604
They will welcome a well-timed
offer that implies a truce.

17:53.606 --> 17:55.139
You'll see.

17:58.311 --> 18:00.778
Narcisse came to you
officially, asking to court me?

18:00.780 --> 18:02.780
(baby coos)
And was swiftly denied.

18:02.782 --> 18:04.515
Oh, by me as well.

18:04.517 --> 18:06.117
He is relentless.

18:06.119 --> 18:08.319
Did you encourage him in this?

18:08.321 --> 18:10.588
No, just the opposite.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.623
Present a challenge in a way
that engages him?

18:12.625 --> 18:14.559
I resent your implication.

18:14.561 --> 18:16.561
My implication is that
you might be lonely.

18:16.563 --> 18:18.396
That by sleeping
with a future king,

18:18.398 --> 18:20.565
you had no idea that you'd be
handing over your freedom,

18:20.567 --> 18:23.501
freedom to choose
your own suitor.

18:23.503 --> 18:25.503
I know Narcisse
can wear people down,

18:25.505 --> 18:27.405
but I don't want him
anywhere near our son.

18:27.407 --> 18:28.639
Near him?

18:28.641 --> 18:30.641
He was only near
him to save him,

18:30.643 --> 18:33.444
to save me, when your
mother had us abducted.

18:33.446 --> 18:34.645
Do you hear the way
you're defending him?

18:34.647 --> 18:36.280
I know you
may not want to,

18:36.282 --> 18:37.448
but you have
feelings towards him.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.450
And I don't want
John growing up,

18:39.452 --> 18:41.486
believing that Narcisse
is what a man should be.

18:41.488 --> 18:42.520
What a man
should be?

18:42.522 --> 18:44.422
Francis, you are his father.

18:44.424 --> 18:45.623
John will model
himself after you.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.592
Won't he?
Of course.

18:47.594 --> 18:49.260
Are you thinking
of sending us away?

18:49.262 --> 18:50.328
No.

18:51.431 --> 18:53.798
I'm not, I swear it.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.533
But then...

18:58.505 --> 19:00.438
The topic of Narcisse
is finished.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.540
I forbid your union,
and in doing so,

19:02.542 --> 19:05.610
I am saving you from the biggest
mistake of your life.

19:05.612 --> 19:07.445
You have my attention,
what is it?

19:07.447 --> 19:09.780
Your Majesty, the queen
requests your presence.

19:11.618 --> 19:13.551
MARY:<i> It's a message</i>
<i> from Elizabeth herself.</i>

19:13.553 --> 19:15.753
She wants
to marry Charles.

19:15.755 --> 19:17.488
Why?

19:17.490 --> 19:19.590
I think the answer
is in her terms.

19:19.592 --> 19:21.659
The battle for control
of Scotland rages on.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.494
But she is so close
to an advantage.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.363
Well, she doesn't know that.

19:25.365 --> 19:26.564
She doesn't know
how close we are

19:26.566 --> 19:28.366
to being incapable
of supporting French troops,

19:28.368 --> 19:30.234
let alone Scottish ones.

19:30.236 --> 19:31.836
Her offer could not
be more timely.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.671
We will find the money, Mary.

19:33.673 --> 19:36.607
Resorting to piracy
will keep the war going.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.576
Our troops will make progress,

19:38.578 --> 19:40.845
the English-backed
Protestants will retreat.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.580
But then they will
move forward and back

19:42.582 --> 19:45.516
until it all blurs into
a bloody, endless stalemate.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.585
It's a drain
on our resources,

19:47.587 --> 19:49.854
and England's, too,
and has been for years.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.789
Elizabeth's real war is with me.

19:51.791 --> 19:53.958
My claim to her throne.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.893
Perhaps her advisors
have realized this

19:55.895 --> 19:57.528
and are pressuring her.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.597
But an engagement with Charles
creates an alliance.

19:59.599 --> 20:00.932
How difficult
would it then be

20:00.934 --> 20:02.633
for France to
overrule my brother,

20:02.635 --> 20:04.468
about Scotland or any matter?

20:04.470 --> 20:05.970
Very difficult.
I know that.

20:05.972 --> 20:07.972
But if we allow her
to marry Charles,

20:07.974 --> 20:10.608
she has said she will cease
her aggressions in Scotland.

20:10.610 --> 20:14.412
Francis, someone has to make
the first move toward peace.

20:14.414 --> 20:15.713
Do we find it so unbelievable

20:15.715 --> 20:17.548
because she is the one
doing it and not me?

20:17.550 --> 20:19.750
By giving Elizabeth
this alliance,

20:19.752 --> 20:21.619
we are calling it even
in one area...

20:21.621 --> 20:23.354
Mary, it won't be even.

20:23.356 --> 20:25.756
No. She will have a prince
and I will have a king.

20:25.758 --> 20:27.658
You cannot do this.

20:27.660 --> 20:28.793
Why?

20:28.795 --> 20:30.628
Because you will not have

20:30.630 --> 20:32.730
the king of France.

20:38.271 --> 20:39.670
When I became ill,

20:39.672 --> 20:42.373
with the pain in my ear,
and fever,

20:42.375 --> 20:44.008
they told me that
if the pain returned,

20:44.010 --> 20:45.743
I would not survive long.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.813
It has returned.

20:48.815 --> 20:50.781
No.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.683
They're wrong...
And when
I am gone,

20:52.685 --> 20:55.653
you will have no position here
but that of a widow,

20:55.655 --> 20:57.588
and I cannot abandon
you unprotected.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.824
I cannot, I cannot
leave you...
You won't.

20:59.826 --> 21:01.892
We'll find other physicians,
experts...
No.

21:01.894 --> 21:03.661
No, Mary. Please, listen.

21:03.663 --> 21:05.963
Please hear me.

21:07.700 --> 21:10.368
I am dying.

21:12.672 --> 21:13.904
I'm dying.

21:13.906 --> 21:17.441
(sobbing)

21:33.926 --> 21:36.594
(crows cawing)

21:36.596 --> 21:38.729
(door opens)

22:00.620 --> 22:02.019
You will survive this.

22:02.021 --> 22:05.523
And I will help you
in every way that I can.

22:05.525 --> 22:08.025
I've already sent for
my brother weeks ago.

22:08.027 --> 22:10.061
Charles?

22:10.063 --> 22:12.563
He doesn't know that
he'll be king soon enough,

22:12.565 --> 22:15.032
but he should be here.

22:15.034 --> 22:17.635
We must keep
my illness a secret

22:17.637 --> 22:19.437
for as long as possible.

22:19.439 --> 22:21.739
To put the pieces
in place.

22:21.741 --> 22:23.808
I can't think about politics
right now.

22:23.810 --> 22:25.609
You don't need to.

22:25.611 --> 22:27.078
I have.

22:27.080 --> 22:30.414
I will protect you and France.

22:32.051 --> 22:33.851
Stop being so strong,

22:33.853 --> 22:35.986
so perfect.

22:35.988 --> 22:38.789
Worrying about me when you...

22:38.791 --> 22:41.058
When we...

22:41.060 --> 22:43.828
I don't know how much
time we have left.

22:43.830 --> 22:47.064
But every moment matters.

22:47.066 --> 22:49.700
It always did, I just didn't...

22:49.702 --> 22:51.736
I didn't see it before.

22:51.738 --> 22:54.739
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you sooner.

22:54.741 --> 22:57.541
Things between us, I...

22:57.543 --> 22:59.810
I didn't want you to return
to me out of pity.

22:59.812 --> 23:02.613
Francis, I love you.

23:02.615 --> 23:05.015
And once I had you back,

23:05.017 --> 23:06.917
I just wanted
to enjoy every moment

23:06.919 --> 23:08.519
of your happiness.

23:08.521 --> 23:10.755
If that's selfish,
I'm sorry, but

23:10.757 --> 23:14.458
I am determined to find
the joy in our lives.

23:17.563 --> 23:20.030
In the small things...

23:20.032 --> 23:21.665
In everything.

23:21.667 --> 23:22.700
It all makes
sense now.

23:22.702 --> 23:24.935
The boat?

23:26.873 --> 23:28.839
Yes. The boat.

23:28.841 --> 23:30.941
(laughs)

23:30.943 --> 23:32.743
(sniffs)

23:34.480 --> 23:36.947
Will you come with me?

23:38.117 --> 23:42.787
¶ While the water is rising ¶

23:44.690 --> 23:47.691
¶ Will you still keep me ¶

23:47.693 --> 23:51.162
¶ In your sight? ¶

23:51.164 --> 23:56.100
¶ Oh... ¶

23:57.069 --> 24:01.972
¶ Oh... ¶

24:05.044 --> 24:07.478
MARTIN:
You are ravishing, charming,

24:07.480 --> 24:08.913
highborn, a lady.

24:08.915 --> 24:10.614
What else should
I know about you?

24:10.616 --> 24:13.584
I am highborn,
it's true, but...

24:13.586 --> 24:14.985
But more of a madam
than a lady?

24:14.987 --> 24:16.987
I know about
the whorehouse.

24:16.989 --> 24:18.756
Then you probably know

24:18.758 --> 24:20.624
I've only recently been
welcomed back to court.

24:20.626 --> 24:22.226
And none of this
bothers you?

24:22.228 --> 24:24.061
I like that
you're scrappy.

24:24.063 --> 24:26.130
But it's good you have an
interest to keep you occupied,

24:26.132 --> 24:27.832
as I'm gone for
months at a time.

24:27.834 --> 24:29.500
How many months?

24:29.502 --> 24:31.135
Ten out of 12,
I'd say.

24:31.137 --> 24:32.603
I'll send letters,

24:32.605 --> 24:34.238
along with jewels
and gold.

24:34.240 --> 24:35.773
We could have
a few children.

24:35.775 --> 24:37.074
Would you like that?

24:37.076 --> 24:39.844
I no longer thought
it was a possibility.

24:39.846 --> 24:42.613
Why? Because of
your profession?

24:42.615 --> 24:45.249
Surely they would be
ashamed of me.

24:45.251 --> 24:47.017
I'll teach them
not to judge you.

24:47.019 --> 24:48.886
You can teach them
not to judge me.

24:48.888 --> 24:51.555
They'll grow,
knowing they've parents

24:51.557 --> 24:54.091
who've each found a way
to weave some right

24:54.093 --> 24:55.793
into what many
consider wrong.

24:55.795 --> 24:57.027
What is it?

24:57.029 --> 24:59.530
You're a surprising man.

24:59.532 --> 25:00.865
I like you, too.

25:05.905 --> 25:07.938
(indistinct chatter)

25:10.843 --> 25:12.977
Charles.

25:26.959 --> 25:28.659
(crows cawing)

25:32.832 --> 25:34.832
DEPUTY:
My lord.

25:34.834 --> 25:37.902
You have news of Delphine.
It took
a bit longer

25:37.904 --> 25:39.270
than expected to reach the town

25:39.272 --> 25:41.772
where she was held, and by
the time we got there...

25:41.774 --> 25:43.040
She'd slipped her bonds
and got away.

25:43.042 --> 25:45.109
Yes.
How did you know?

25:45.111 --> 25:47.211
I saw you and your men arrive

25:47.213 --> 25:48.946
with no prisoner in tow.

25:48.948 --> 25:50.214
We'll continue the search

25:50.216 --> 25:51.949
and bring you any leads we hear.

25:51.951 --> 25:53.651
Especially anything
closer to court.

25:55.087 --> 25:57.621
(crows cawing)

25:57.623 --> 25:59.156
She is near.

26:12.038 --> 26:13.671
Watch this, Charles.

26:14.340 --> 26:16.740
You've much to teach me.

26:16.742 --> 26:18.676
I'm glad that
you think so.

26:18.678 --> 26:20.210
I'd love to work
with the master

26:20.212 --> 26:22.046
who first trained
you in archery.

26:22.048 --> 26:23.747
Who's planning
gatherings these days?

26:23.749 --> 26:25.015
And where can
I have one,

26:25.017 --> 26:26.250
so it won't
get in the way?

26:26.252 --> 26:27.918
Get in the way of what?

26:27.920 --> 26:29.620
Court business.
Prying eyes.

26:29.622 --> 26:31.622
I hear you're
quite the host.

26:31.624 --> 26:33.157
That you got into
a bit of trouble

26:33.159 --> 26:35.192
for such gatherings
in Spain.

26:35.194 --> 26:37.928
That wasn't the reason
that engagement was called off.

26:37.930 --> 26:39.363
Well, you're a free man now
and back home.

26:39.365 --> 26:42.199
And the reason I brought
you here was to educate you.

26:42.201 --> 26:44.702
You are the Dauphin now,
the next in line.

26:44.704 --> 26:46.070
So I'm to learn
about trade routes

26:46.072 --> 26:47.104
and intricate power plays

26:47.106 --> 26:48.973
our nobles favor?

26:48.975 --> 26:50.774
Every guardian
I've ever had says the same.

26:50.776 --> 26:52.643
Well, now it's time to listen.

26:52.645 --> 26:54.244
All right.

26:54.246 --> 26:56.213
But first let's
go for a ride.

26:56.215 --> 26:58.082
I brought a fine mare
with me from the south.

26:58.084 --> 26:59.283
A good jumper.

26:59.285 --> 27:01.051
We'll take the path
beyond the chapel.

27:01.053 --> 27:03.320
Oh, I'd like that, but I have
business to attend to.

27:03.322 --> 27:05.189
But I thought you said
you wanted to talk.
We will.

27:05.191 --> 27:08.292
Now that you're home.

27:08.294 --> 27:10.094
Enjoy.
I'll see you at supper.

27:11.697 --> 27:12.963
Thanks.

27:12.965 --> 27:14.698
Have fun being king.

27:22.008 --> 27:24.074
(clattering,
water splashing)

27:40.726 --> 27:41.992
Lola.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.027
What are you doing
in my chambers?

27:43.029 --> 27:45.062
Taking a bath.

27:45.064 --> 27:46.330
You like me in baths.

27:46.332 --> 27:48.298
I do.

27:48.300 --> 27:50.401
Would you like to join me?

27:50.403 --> 27:52.002
Am I to understand

27:52.004 --> 27:53.671
that you have rethought
my proposition?

27:53.673 --> 27:55.339
That you're willing
to let me court you?

27:55.341 --> 27:57.775
Must we talk about that now?

28:01.080 --> 28:03.147
Are you just going to watch?

28:03.149 --> 28:05.749
What were you thinking
you would do,

28:05.751 --> 28:07.751
beyond this bathing moment?

28:07.753 --> 28:08.986
When I shared
my fondness

28:08.988 --> 28:13.757
for this particular situation,

28:13.759 --> 28:15.125
my plan was
to seduce you.

28:15.127 --> 28:16.160
That was before

28:16.162 --> 28:18.829
I came to care for you as I do.

28:18.831 --> 28:22.433
So you don't enjoy
the bathing ritual anymore?

28:22.435 --> 28:24.835
That is not what
I'm saying, Lola.

28:24.837 --> 28:28.172
But is this your idea of a...
a seduction?

28:28.174 --> 28:30.007
Phrased like that,

28:30.009 --> 28:31.775
it certainly sounds
like a failed seduction.

28:31.777 --> 28:33.043
You do not need

28:33.045 --> 28:36.046
to seduce a man
who already wants you.

28:36.048 --> 28:38.449
Francis denied
my request to court you.

28:38.451 --> 28:40.851
Has he changed his mind?
Have you?

28:40.853 --> 28:43.187
And why does it have
to be so formal?

28:43.189 --> 28:45.122
Why can't we just try this,

28:45.124 --> 28:46.724
in secret?

28:46.726 --> 28:48.859
Because you said I scared you.

28:48.861 --> 28:50.194
That you don't trust me.

28:50.196 --> 28:53.130
As a potential husband,
a true partner.

28:53.132 --> 28:55.032
But Francis
forbade that,

28:55.034 --> 28:56.433
as you said, so...

28:56.435 --> 28:58.202
So you feel protected.

28:58.204 --> 29:01.038
That we can only go
so far with one another.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.040
That whatever
you do or feel,

29:03.042 --> 29:05.809
you are saved
from making a terrible mistake.

29:05.811 --> 29:08.178
Francis said the same thing.

29:08.180 --> 29:10.214
He called it
the mistake of my life.

29:10.216 --> 29:11.949
Which is true,

29:11.951 --> 29:13.984
but so is this:

29:13.986 --> 29:16.787
I am yours this night.

29:16.789 --> 29:19.156
No.

29:19.158 --> 29:20.224
Not like this.

29:20.226 --> 29:23.227
I am going
to marry you.

29:23.229 --> 29:24.995
And I can promise you

29:24.997 --> 29:26.230
that it is not a mistake,

29:26.232 --> 29:28.832
because we are right
for each other.

29:28.834 --> 29:30.901
You don't see it, but I do.

29:34.406 --> 29:37.107
And I am prepared to wait

29:37.109 --> 29:39.843
until you see it, too.

29:44.383 --> 29:46.316
(laughter)

29:52.124 --> 29:54.124
I got your note
that you're leaving.

29:54.126 --> 29:56.426
Greer, the night we
spent together...

29:56.428 --> 29:59.196
Shh!

29:59.198 --> 30:01.265
I brought you this
to take on your journey.

30:01.267 --> 30:02.499
I noticed some of your men
wore the locks

30:02.501 --> 30:03.500
of the women they love.

30:03.502 --> 30:06.036
Your beautiful hair.

30:06.038 --> 30:08.105
Greer...

30:08.107 --> 30:09.506
Wait, is-is that...?

30:09.508 --> 30:11.041
The hair of another.

30:11.043 --> 30:13.110
I enjoyed our time
together so much.

30:13.112 --> 30:15.412
And the choice
was so difficult.

30:15.414 --> 30:17.147
Choice?

30:17.149 --> 30:20.050
You were choosing between
me and some other girl?

30:20.052 --> 30:22.052
I said I was looking
for a bride.

30:22.054 --> 30:23.954
I didn't say I was only
looking at one candidate.

30:23.956 --> 30:26.890
You can't be serious.
As though you're some prize?

30:26.892 --> 30:28.492
Some, some...
I'm a skilled thief.

30:28.494 --> 30:30.260
A pirate with all my arms,

30:30.262 --> 30:32.296
legs and teeth,
which is a rarity.

30:32.298 --> 30:34.431
And I make rich
those who employ me.

30:34.433 --> 30:36.166
A Dutch baron, who is here
at court with his family,

30:36.168 --> 30:38.202
put his daughter
in the running, too.

30:38.204 --> 30:39.136
She won.

30:39.138 --> 30:41.205
This... never happens to me.

30:41.207 --> 30:43.173
I would never...

30:43.175 --> 30:45.843
so casually,
without some...

30:45.845 --> 30:48.145
promise of something,
some deeper bond or...

30:48.147 --> 30:49.913
I'm sorry you were so mistaken.

30:49.915 --> 30:51.582
But I'm sure we'll
see each other again.

30:54.553 --> 30:56.987
You are a scoundrel, a rogue.

31:00.359 --> 31:01.475
A pirate.

31:01.476 --> 31:02.592
MARY:
<i> So Catherine</i>
<i> took a lover, a monk,</i>

31:02.595 --> 31:04.228
who bled to death
from his wounds,

31:04.230 --> 31:06.129
but how was he wounded?

31:06.131 --> 31:07.598
It was a saw blade, apparently.

31:07.600 --> 31:09.933
After the poor young monk
shared an encounter

31:09.935 --> 31:11.335
with the queen mother.

31:11.337 --> 31:12.970
They thought the mill
was inoperable,

31:12.972 --> 31:15.105
but their position
activated a lever and...

31:15.107 --> 31:16.940
Oh, Lord!

31:16.942 --> 31:18.542
Once she learned
that her lover

31:18.544 --> 31:20.277
bled to death,

31:20.279 --> 31:22.112
she was so stricken with guilt

31:22.114 --> 31:24.581
that she hanged herself.

31:24.583 --> 31:27.951
Catherine de Medici is dead.

31:27.953 --> 31:29.219
Catherine?

31:29.221 --> 31:31.421
(laughs):
Guilt-stricken?

31:31.423 --> 31:34.324
FRANCIS:
<i> That's not the woman we know.</i>

31:34.326 --> 31:35.626
Well, it can't be, can it?

31:35.628 --> 31:37.561
She must have
used a decoy.

31:37.563 --> 31:39.930
So where is she now?

31:39.932 --> 31:41.965
And what on earth is she up to?

31:41.967 --> 31:43.500
Narcisse requested
a meeting that might

31:43.502 --> 31:44.568
have an answer to that question.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.603
He says that he has

31:46.605 --> 31:48.272
news from Italy.

31:48.274 --> 31:49.673
And what news
from our spy in Rome?

31:49.675 --> 31:52.376
A small delegation
arrived surreptitiously.

31:52.378 --> 31:54.578
They were granted an audience
with someone very high up,

31:54.580 --> 31:56.680
whom they told
in great detail

31:56.682 --> 31:58.248
of your relationship with Condé.

31:58.250 --> 32:01.118
Oh, what have I done?

32:01.120 --> 32:02.586
If the Vatican

32:02.588 --> 32:04.354
withdraws its support from me,
from Scotland...

32:04.356 --> 32:06.356
Who did they meet with?

32:06.358 --> 32:07.925
No one wants to say,

32:07.927 --> 32:09.593
as the delegation was
shown to their rooms

32:09.595 --> 32:11.561
and quietly assassinated.

32:11.563 --> 32:13.297
This is ghastly!

32:13.299 --> 32:15.365
As is treason,
which is what this was.

32:15.367 --> 32:17.234
Whoever sent those
people misjudged

32:17.236 --> 32:20.103
Rome's determination to
keep Scotland Catholic.

32:20.105 --> 32:23.373
Even if it means murder
to support a sinful queen.

32:23.375 --> 32:26.209
Mary, do not look to the past.
I'm not.

32:26.211 --> 32:28.578
Indeed, you should be
looking across the channel.

32:28.580 --> 32:30.380
Amongst the accusers'
possessions

32:30.382 --> 32:31.715
were letters
guaranteeing

32:31.717 --> 32:33.283
safe passage to England.

32:34.253 --> 32:36.453
She's there.

32:36.455 --> 32:37.721
NARCISSE:
Who?

32:37.723 --> 32:39.323
My mother.

32:39.325 --> 32:41.258
MARY:
Elizabeth is
considered a heretic.

32:41.260 --> 32:43.160
She has no ties to the Vatican.

32:43.162 --> 32:44.628
It wouldn't occur to her
to set this up.

32:44.630 --> 32:46.563
Or pull it off if she did.

32:46.565 --> 32:48.265
My mother sat in
on our privy council meetings.

32:48.267 --> 32:49.700
She's at Elizabeth's side,

32:49.702 --> 32:51.601
feeding her information.

32:51.603 --> 32:53.236
Catherine wants
to destroy me.

32:53.238 --> 32:54.538
And if she can't,
she'll help Elizabeth

32:54.540 --> 32:55.973
destroy my nation.

32:55.975 --> 32:57.474
Leave us.

32:58.610 --> 33:02.179
Mary, I will help you
for as long as I can.

33:02.181 --> 33:04.047
I can't take on two queens.

33:04.049 --> 33:06.016
Not alone, you mean.

33:06.018 --> 33:08.318
I have to agree to the meeting
with Elizabeth.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.988
If we allow her to marry
Charles, you'll lose your power.

33:10.990 --> 33:13.557
Soon, I fear, I will have
nothing left to lose.

33:15.260 --> 33:17.327
It's time to deal
with her directly.

33:17.329 --> 33:19.363
Whatever the cost may be.

33:28.674 --> 33:31.241
DELPHINE:
Bash? Bash!

33:32.277 --> 33:34.177
Delphine.

33:34.179 --> 33:36.113
What?
How?

33:36.115 --> 33:38.448
I can't move.

33:38.450 --> 33:40.217
Because I drugged your wine.

33:40.219 --> 33:42.052
I am innocent, Bash,

33:42.054 --> 33:43.653
of the murder I was accused of.

33:43.655 --> 33:45.188
Of witchcraft.

33:45.190 --> 33:48.191
But you didn't...
(sighs)

33:48.193 --> 33:49.659
you didn't...
Burn?

33:49.661 --> 33:51.361
I asked not to be drowned,

33:51.363 --> 33:53.430
because I knew I could
survive the flames.

33:53.432 --> 33:55.032
I covered myself with
a protective ointment.

33:55.034 --> 33:56.299
I could feel the heat, though.

33:56.301 --> 33:58.068
It was agony.

33:58.070 --> 34:00.370
Whoever killed that boy, the one
whose death I am blamed for,

34:00.372 --> 34:01.538
will kill again.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.807
I have felt their urges.

34:03.809 --> 34:06.410
A thirst that will
never be slaked.

34:06.412 --> 34:07.711
You must stop them, Bash.

34:09.181 --> 34:11.281
Let others come for me
if you must.

34:11.283 --> 34:13.550
But stay here
and stop them.

34:15.621 --> 34:17.354
(winces)

34:17.356 --> 34:20.223
So you know
you weren't dreaming.

34:26.765 --> 34:28.532
(indistinct chatter)

34:28.534 --> 34:30.200
LOLA:
I feel as though

34:30.202 --> 34:31.668
I'm ten hiding up here.

34:31.670 --> 34:34.204
Is a pirate really
worth this effort?

34:34.206 --> 34:35.672
I can't face him, Lola.

34:35.674 --> 34:37.441
Not after what
happened between us.

34:37.443 --> 34:39.376
Did you see him
with the Dutch baron's daughter?

34:39.378 --> 34:40.610
No.

34:40.612 --> 34:42.546
She must be very beautiful.

34:42.548 --> 34:44.681
Greer, listen.

34:44.683 --> 34:47.551
I've-- I learned something.

34:47.553 --> 34:50.620
Martin told the baron's daughter
the same story.

34:50.622 --> 34:52.456
That he'd chosen another--
some girl from the Pyrenees.

34:52.458 --> 34:55.392
So we were all
jockeying up to try

34:55.394 --> 34:57.094
and better a girl
he already had?

34:57.096 --> 34:59.796
Well, my guess is, he'll tell
her there's yet another.

34:59.798 --> 35:01.565
How do you know
these things?

35:01.567 --> 35:04.634
One of my servants became
acquainted with one of his men.

35:04.636 --> 35:07.170
And she learned he's not looking
for a bride at all.

35:07.172 --> 35:09.606
He likes highborn ladies,
so he rolls out a quick proposal

35:09.608 --> 35:11.141
to get them into bed.

35:11.143 --> 35:12.576
That is monstrous
and despicable

35:12.578 --> 35:15.412
to mislead and use people.

35:15.414 --> 35:17.114
Not quite the way
you were planning to use him,

35:17.116 --> 35:18.582
but you were planning
on using him, weren't you?

35:18.584 --> 35:20.584
But I changed my mind.

35:20.586 --> 35:22.586
I was actually considering
a relationship with him.

35:22.588 --> 35:24.421
Marriage even.

35:24.423 --> 35:27.457
Well, the good news
is that he's still single.

35:27.459 --> 35:29.893
Should he return to court
and you be open to...

35:29.895 --> 35:31.461
a renegotiation?

35:31.463 --> 35:33.330
Never.

35:34.500 --> 35:36.366
(laughs)

35:36.368 --> 35:37.701
(horse snorts)

35:38.904 --> 35:40.570
(horse neighs)

35:51.617 --> 35:53.283
(man shouts indistinctly)

35:53.285 --> 35:54.818
I'll decide where
to set up the tent.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.786
I want Mary to climb
the hill to me.

35:56.788 --> 35:58.221
Charles, too.

35:58.223 --> 35:59.523
(man shouts indistinctly)

35:59.525 --> 36:00.590
GUARDS:
Sir!

36:02.728 --> 36:04.427
I don't understand.

36:04.429 --> 36:06.496
Where is she?

36:06.498 --> 36:09.232
I don't even see a
ship on the horizon.

36:09.234 --> 36:10.500
GUARD: I don't know,
Your Majesty.

36:10.502 --> 36:11.768
It is odd.

36:11.770 --> 36:13.637
Rest assured,
you are protected.

36:13.639 --> 36:16.606
We have come in force with the
best of your castle guards.

36:18.877 --> 36:20.310
The castle, unguarded.

36:20.312 --> 36:21.778
They're coming for Catherine.

36:21.780 --> 36:24.648
No.

36:24.650 --> 36:27.951
Oh, my Lord.

36:27.953 --> 36:30.220
(muffled grunting)

36:33.292 --> 36:35.292
WILLIAM:
<i> The men who took Catherine</i>
<i> were English.</i>

36:35.294 --> 36:36.560
<i> Frequent guests at court.</i>

36:36.562 --> 36:38.261
Catholics I tolerated.

36:38.263 --> 36:39.596
They were armed.
With so many men

36:39.598 --> 36:41.298
away from court
to ensure your protection...

36:41.300 --> 36:43.333
While I stood on the beach
and waited like a fool.

36:43.335 --> 36:44.634
They entered
and left the castle easily.

36:44.636 --> 36:46.603
She dared to take
me on directly!

36:46.605 --> 36:48.638
Mary planned this entire
thing to seize Catherine
and take her home.

36:48.640 --> 36:51.441
They never even considered
an English-French alliance.

36:51.443 --> 36:52.742
And you never considered
peace with Mary.

36:52.744 --> 36:54.344
You and Catherine de Medici
had some other plan

36:54.346 --> 36:56.279
to topple her rule
in Scotland, didn't you?

36:56.281 --> 36:58.748
Mary threatens me, William.

36:58.750 --> 37:00.650
It isn't just her legitimacy
that makes her a better choice.

37:00.652 --> 37:02.619
It's the fact that she's wed.

37:02.621 --> 37:04.254
Every monarchy needs
a clear heir to the throne,

37:04.256 --> 37:05.522
so power can be passed down

37:05.524 --> 37:07.591
without bloodshed
or the fear of it.

37:07.593 --> 37:09.526
The fear you feel every day.

37:09.528 --> 37:10.694
I don't need any more lectures

37:10.696 --> 37:12.529
on that topic,
thank you.
My queen,

37:12.531 --> 37:14.564
if the goal of creating
an alliance with France

37:14.566 --> 37:15.865
was to even Mary's advantage,

37:15.867 --> 37:17.400
you can do so easily enough.

37:17.402 --> 37:18.435
Take a husband.

37:18.437 --> 37:20.403
Have children,
a son.

37:20.405 --> 37:22.439
Stop turning away
suitor after suitor.

37:22.441 --> 37:24.608
A husband who would diminish me.

37:24.610 --> 37:26.009
You can talk about
our patriarchal system,

37:26.011 --> 37:28.411
its evils for women,
but I know the real reason

37:28.413 --> 37:30.513
that you dismiss marriage.

37:30.515 --> 37:32.449
His name is
Robert Dudley.

37:32.451 --> 37:33.583
Elizabeth?

37:33.585 --> 37:35.018
You must rule your own heart

37:35.020 --> 37:37.721
as firmly as you rule
your subjects.

37:44.596 --> 37:45.929
Are you sure?

37:45.931 --> 37:48.265
If we are caught,

37:48.267 --> 37:50.667
this ruins your chances
at marriage, any alliance.

37:52.638 --> 37:55.272
I don't trust
anyone around me but you.

37:55.274 --> 37:57.641
They tell me to rule my heart,

37:57.643 --> 37:58.942
but what they want
is a man to rule me.

37:58.944 --> 38:01.278
I won't have it.

38:02.447 --> 38:03.847
But Mary...

38:03.849 --> 38:05.949
Don't say her name.
I can't stand her.

38:05.951 --> 38:07.817
I can't stand the fact
that she draws breath.

38:07.819 --> 38:09.653
I am England's queen.

38:09.655 --> 38:11.655
And those who seek to replace me
will suffer my wrath.

38:11.657 --> 38:13.390
That is how I will

38:13.392 --> 38:15.392
protect myself... and you,

38:15.394 --> 38:16.693
Robert.

38:16.695 --> 38:19.596
I swear.

38:21.767 --> 38:23.767
Lady Dudley,
this is remarkable

38:23.769 --> 38:26.002
but quite unexpected--
so young and lovely.

38:26.004 --> 38:27.704
Do shut up now, won't you?
You said you wanted
something from me.

38:27.706 --> 38:29.673
Is it a particular
in the sex act?

38:29.675 --> 38:31.675
I like the details.
That's not what I meant.

38:31.677 --> 38:34.477
Well, then?
If you must know,
if it will quiet you, it's this.

38:34.479 --> 38:35.779
My husband is
in Elizabeth's grasp.

38:35.781 --> 38:37.480
And I'd very much
like him back in mine.

38:37.482 --> 38:38.848
You're going
to help me with that.

38:40.585 --> 38:42.652
(panting)

38:42.654 --> 38:45.455
(horse neighs, snorts)

38:50.829 --> 38:52.362
Clearly we should
have taken your head

38:52.364 --> 38:53.730
when you last betrayed your son.

38:53.732 --> 38:55.432
Now you've
betrayed your nation

38:55.434 --> 38:56.700
by consorting with an enemy.

38:56.702 --> 39:00.804
I sought an alliance
for the good of France.

39:06.445 --> 39:08.478
Take her.

39:08.480 --> 39:10.780
I'm a patriot.

39:10.782 --> 39:12.649
I am your mother.

39:12.651 --> 39:16.086
I will not be treated
like an animal!

39:16.088 --> 39:19.489
You're wrong there.

39:19.491 --> 39:21.991
MARY:
You've met the pirate Martin.

39:21.993 --> 39:23.426
No.

39:23.428 --> 39:25.495
MARY:
Now meet his companion.

39:25.497 --> 39:27.097
(growls)

39:27.099 --> 39:29.632
No!

39:29.634 --> 39:32.068
(screaming)

39:32.070 --> 39:35.638
No! No! No!

39:35.640 --> 39:36.906
(screams)

39:40.112 --> 39:43.079
We have many carriages,
but few moving prisons.

39:43.081 --> 39:46.916
It's hard to say which of you
needs thicker bars.

39:49.454 --> 39:50.920
But I know
who will suffer more.

39:52.023 --> 39:53.790
