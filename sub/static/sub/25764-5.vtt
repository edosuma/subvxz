00:00.009 --> 00:01.677
Previously on Chesapeake Shores:

00:01.843 --> 00:03.400
The last time we were boxing books,

00:03.401 --> 00:05.723
things didn't turn out
exactly as I'd hope.

00:05.890 --> 00:07.840
Now that we are unboxing books,

00:07.841 --> 00:09.185
how would you like it to turn out?

00:09.303 --> 00:12.306
I'm leaving. You can have
your party and your son...

00:12.473 --> 00:15.935
... even though I love him
a lot. But you can't have me.

00:16.143 --> 00:17.353
I was proud of what you did.

00:17.562 --> 00:21.607
But you go to war against me,
you're gonna get shot back at.

00:21.816 --> 00:23.255
I don't want the girls afraid

00:23.256 --> 00:24.990
because they might have
their picture taken.

00:25.194 --> 00:27.363
They get this first shot
and then they move on.

00:27.572 --> 00:30.199
You can't guarantee
that. It might get worse.

00:37.707 --> 00:39.625
Thank you.

00:40.251 --> 00:44.255
Are you kidding? Best burger
by far, the El Camino in Tucson.

00:44.464 --> 00:46.507
Blue cheese, wing sauce.

00:46.674 --> 00:50.052
It's good, but you gotta go
pure. Farmer's in Baltimore.

00:50.219 --> 00:53.848
Old school, cash only, and
they won't even sell you cheese.

00:54.015 --> 00:55.725
- Hey! Later, guys.
- Later.

00:55.892 --> 00:58.561
You remember Big Daddy's Bar in Memphis?

00:58.728 --> 01:02.732
- Don't even mention Big Daddy's.
- Oh, you and the jukebox issue.

01:02.899 --> 01:05.818
- They shouldn't have unplugged it.
- One song for an hour?

01:06.027 --> 01:07.737
I'm a big Merle Haggard fan.

01:07.945 --> 01:09.822
- Of course you are.
- I'm happy to have...

01:10.031 --> 01:12.283
... three days off from
sharing a bus with you guys.

01:12.450 --> 01:15.620
And on that note, I'm
going home to see my kids.

01:16.037 --> 01:17.413
- Hey, Linda.
- Hey, baby.

01:17.580 --> 01:18.790
Hey, welcome back.

01:18.956 --> 01:20.917
- Catch you at the interview tomorrow?
- Yeah.

01:21.083 --> 01:22.873
If we're voting on what
song to add to the set,

01:22.874 --> 01:24.378
I'm for "Bargain and Boots."

01:24.587 --> 01:27.048
- Let's lay down "Country State of Mind."
- Fine by me.

01:27.256 --> 01:29.509
Well, I'm off to see if
I still got my apartment.

01:29.675 --> 01:31.075
- Good luck with that.
- Adios.

01:31.260 --> 01:32.595
All right.

01:33.137 --> 01:35.389
- Hey, Trace.
- Yeah?

01:36.057 --> 01:39.101
Linda and I got a spare bedroom
if you don't want to do the hotel.

01:39.644 --> 01:43.231
It's all right. I'm just gonna
check in, call Abby and crash.

01:43.439 --> 01:46.275
- All right. Sounds good. Yep!
- Thanks.

01:46.484 --> 01:48.611
- Good to see you.
- You too, Trace.

01:48.778 --> 01:50.154
- How you doing, baby?
- Hey.

01:50.404 --> 01:52.240
We'll have you for dinner.

01:58.913 --> 02:01.249
Ugh. I just don't wanna
find another picture.

02:01.415 --> 02:04.085
Didn't Trace say that they back off...

02:04.252 --> 02:06.796
... once they get their pictures
unless there's money involved?

02:06.963 --> 02:09.435
Well... What if he's wrong?

02:09.436 --> 02:11.676
What if it gets worse? What
if this is just the start?

02:11.843 --> 02:15.596
When I moved home, I came so
that life would be simpler.

02:15.763 --> 02:17.807
So I could spend time with
the girls and family...

02:17.974 --> 02:19.892
Life is never simple, Abby.

02:20.768 --> 02:22.603
- Yes, well, it should be.
- Heh.

02:24.689 --> 02:28.317
- Where are you in Bree's manuscript?
- Halfway done. It's good.

02:28.484 --> 02:29.960
I don't understand why
everyone's so upset.

02:29.961 --> 02:31.990
I can kind of see our family.

02:32.154 --> 02:33.739
There's no one like me.

02:34.198 --> 02:35.867
James O'Connell.

02:36.033 --> 02:39.495
What? He runs a ranch in
Colorado. He's nothing like me.

02:39.662 --> 02:41.455
Although I did like this part.

02:41.664 --> 02:43.750
"James' heart was damaged
on the rodeo circuit.

02:43.751 --> 02:45.084
There was no denying his future...

02:45.251 --> 02:49.505
... would be shaped by the vertical
scar that traveled down his chest."

02:49.714 --> 02:52.049
Scars are cool.

02:52.800 --> 02:54.510
You're such a nerd.

02:55.886 --> 02:57.054
Oh...

02:57.221 --> 02:59.098
- Jordan.
- Kevin, look at this.

02:59.265 --> 03:01.058
- What?
- Ugh.

03:01.225 --> 03:04.061
Is she okay? No, I'll be right there.

03:05.062 --> 03:06.105
What is it?

03:06.314 --> 03:09.358
Sarah was hurt at work. She's
on her way to the hospital.

04:16.968 --> 04:19.345
Hey, Kev, you sure
you don't want coffee?

04:19.512 --> 04:21.430
It's undrinkable.

04:21.973 --> 04:24.183
Come on. It can't be that bad.

04:25.977 --> 04:29.897
Mm. Oh, you're right. It is undrinkable.

04:30.856 --> 04:33.901
You know, Connor, Abby's
left. You can too, okay?

04:34.068 --> 04:37.405
I've spent lots of time
in hospitals. I'll survive.

04:37.571 --> 04:39.031
Uh-huh.

04:42.451 --> 04:45.663
That's your big argument
for staying, "Uh-huh"?

04:46.956 --> 04:48.416
Connor, I'm...

04:48.582 --> 04:49.750
I'm fine.

04:50.960 --> 04:55.381
That's like the fiftieth time you've
said, "I'm fine" in the last two hours.

04:57.174 --> 04:58.509
Because I'm not fine.

04:58.843 --> 05:01.012
Hey, I know.

05:01.887 --> 05:03.750
I don't think I understood
what you guys went through

05:03.751 --> 05:05.975
when I got hurt until now.

05:07.601 --> 05:10.271
Honestly, I don't know
which one is worse.

05:13.315 --> 05:14.442
Hey.

05:15.151 --> 05:16.569
So, what's going on?

05:16.736 --> 05:19.238
Few bumps and bruises.
Could've been worse.

05:19.405 --> 05:20.990
They spent the night checking on her.

05:22.408 --> 05:23.909
How close was it?

05:24.285 --> 05:29.331
I pulled her out before the roof
collapsed. Honestly, too close.

05:30.207 --> 05:33.627
I'm fine. You don't have
to wheel me out. I can walk.

05:33.794 --> 05:36.088
Okay, Sarah!

05:37.715 --> 05:39.592
Let's get you out of here.

05:39.759 --> 05:42.011
Yeah. I'm fine. Thanks.

05:47.016 --> 05:49.477
Just curious. Is there
anyone manning the station?

06:00.404 --> 06:02.531
All right. Thank you very much.

06:02.698 --> 06:05.034
Sarah's gonna be okay. We
can give thanks for that.

06:07.787 --> 06:09.747
I don't think she's
gonna be that hungry, Mom.

06:09.914 --> 06:11.582
Then it's for Kevin also.

06:11.749 --> 06:14.210
- Oh, muffins.
- You must be exhausted.

06:14.376 --> 06:16.962
- Yeah. Luckily, Connor took over for me.
- How's Kevin doing?

06:17.171 --> 06:20.132
- He's telling everyone he's fine.
- Of course he is.

06:20.341 --> 06:23.219
- And you?
- I'm in need of a coffee and a shower.

06:23.385 --> 06:26.222
- Oh, and a ride to Baltimore.
- I'll give you one when I take down...

06:26.388 --> 06:28.250
- ... the wedding lights.
- Forty-five minutes?

06:28.251 --> 06:29.251
Yeah.

06:32.645 --> 06:33.896
You okay there?

06:35.314 --> 06:38.108
Okay, who had the worst night ever?

06:38.275 --> 06:41.070
Me. Hands down. No argument possible.

06:41.278 --> 06:43.489
- Don't think that's true.
- Sarah got hurt on duty.

06:43.656 --> 06:45.908
- What? Is she okay?
- Yeah.

06:46.075 --> 06:49.036
Yeah, no, she's fine.
Kevin's taking her home.

06:49.954 --> 06:51.872
- Hey, morning.
- Hey.

06:52.039 --> 06:54.166
I brought cinnamon rolls
for Kevin and Sarah.

06:54.375 --> 06:57.336
Would you be putting them in
the basket. Please? Thank you.

06:57.503 --> 06:59.594
- Why was your night bad?
- I was up all night...

06:59.595 --> 07:00.703
trying to put them together.

07:01.799 --> 07:03.759
- Hitting a deadline?
- More like missing one.

07:03.843 --> 07:05.761
You know what Ms. Marvel
says about deadlines:

07:05.928 --> 07:09.056
They're like dominos. If one's
out of place, nothing falls.

07:09.223 --> 07:11.976
Well, you can tell Ms. Marvel
she can take her domino and...

07:12.184 --> 07:14.186
Well, I can't wait to read it.

07:15.563 --> 07:20.776
Anyway, I have... Now I'm getting
daily calls from my publisher...

07:20.943 --> 07:23.863
- ... asking when it's gonna be done.
- So can't help me with the lights?

07:24.029 --> 07:26.407
- No, I can't.
- Think Jess will have time?

07:26.574 --> 07:28.454
Jess is at the B&B
putting it back together.

07:28.576 --> 07:31.566
Whoever took care of it while
we were gone made a mess.

07:31.567 --> 07:33.706
Starving artist. Bye!

07:36.208 --> 07:37.293
Megan?

07:38.002 --> 07:40.462
Would you help me take down the lights?

07:40.629 --> 07:42.882
I'm it. I'd love to.

07:46.427 --> 07:48.554
The toughest part's being
on a bus for six months.

07:48.721 --> 07:50.723
I know more about these
guys than I ever wanted to.

07:50.890 --> 07:53.309
But it's nice, being
together on the road.

07:53.475 --> 07:56.812
- The band is like a second family.
- Yeah, the one you never wanted.

07:58.606 --> 08:01.525
We're glad the Trace Riley
Band is back together.

08:01.692 --> 08:05.362
When we come back in a minute,
wanna play something for us?

08:05.571 --> 08:07.198
You know it.

08:11.035 --> 08:12.536
You got 30 seconds, guys.

08:14.830 --> 08:17.124
I can't believe we're
being featured on WDPL.

08:17.291 --> 08:18.751
It's going well, right?

08:18.918 --> 08:20.330
And I can't believe my wife wants me

08:20.331 --> 08:22.130
to invite you guys for dinner tonight.

08:22.296 --> 08:26.508
- I can't. Plans.
- Of course. Yeah. What about you, Trace?

08:26.675 --> 08:28.677
- Is Linda cooking?
- Yeah.

08:28.844 --> 08:31.722
- Then I'd love to come.
- Of course. Six o'clock.

08:31.889 --> 08:35.226
- All right.
- Guys, we're back in three, two...

08:37.895 --> 08:40.898
- I just walked out.
- Was that a walk? I'd call that stomp.

08:41.065 --> 08:43.169
- It was impressive.
- It was, wasn't it?

08:43.171 --> 08:44.385
I just can't believe
David and I are over.

08:47.571 --> 08:50.074
Maybe the Pecks understood how I felt.

08:50.741 --> 08:52.400
Maybe they're gonna welcome me back.

08:52.401 --> 08:56.000
Maybe the phone will ring right now.

08:57.081 --> 08:58.082
Right now.

08:59.959 --> 09:01.710
Right now.

09:02.253 --> 09:04.129
This timing thing is not working out.

09:04.296 --> 09:06.340
- It's not necessarily over.
- It is.

09:06.507 --> 09:08.685
I'd love nothing more than to go down

09:08.686 --> 09:09.970
this emotional rabbit hole with you.

09:10.135 --> 09:13.180
But right now I have to focus on
reality and what's in front me.

09:13.389 --> 09:16.308
And at this moment it is writing
problems that won't go away.

09:16.517 --> 09:19.687
You could do what I'm doing and
pretend it's over, like David and me.

09:19.853 --> 09:21.188
- Done.
- Does it work?

09:21.397 --> 09:23.983
- No, it's making me angry.
- I'm angry too.

09:24.149 --> 09:27.361
I spent so much time writing this,
and my editor is pressuring me...

09:27.569 --> 09:31.282
- ... to rush the editing. That's not simple.
- Especially for someone...

09:31.448 --> 09:33.784
... who overcomplicates everything.

09:35.202 --> 09:36.578
Simon?

09:36.745 --> 09:39.665
- What are you doing here?
- I was talking to your editor...

09:39.832 --> 09:41.020
... who also happens to be my editor,

09:41.021 --> 09:44.630
and I volunteered to
help simplify your life.

09:45.296 --> 09:47.965
- You mean my book?
- Of course.

09:48.424 --> 09:50.009
Brilliant.

09:50.801 --> 09:52.303
So...

09:54.972 --> 09:56.015
Hmm.

09:56.640 --> 09:59.810
- There are more boxes in the garage.
- Found them.

10:01.061 --> 10:03.022
- Thank you.
- Here you are.

10:03.814 --> 10:08.736
- Hey, how are Thomas and Robin doing?
- They're having an amazing time.

10:08.902 --> 10:11.363
- He's teaching her how to surf.
- Surfing, huh?

10:11.530 --> 10:14.033
- Mm-hm.
- Well, I hope it works out.

10:14.533 --> 10:18.454
- You don't sound enthusiastic.
- No. I hope it works out for them.

10:18.620 --> 10:21.749
- It has been 30 years.
- That's no reason not to try.

10:21.957 --> 10:24.293
But there is reason for
diminished expectations.

10:24.460 --> 10:27.921
- Maybe, but I'm not giving up hope.
- No. Nor am I.

10:28.964 --> 10:31.425
- Same go for you and Connor?
- Of course.

10:31.592 --> 10:35.554
- Because, Mick, it seems that...
- We will work it out. I promise you.

10:36.138 --> 10:37.624
"Working it out" should be

10:37.625 --> 10:39.767
above the O'Brien crest.
Right under stubborn.

10:39.933 --> 10:42.895
- What about charm? O'Briens have lots.
- Oh, really?

10:43.270 --> 10:46.106
- I've been known to have my moments.
- Once or twice.

10:46.315 --> 10:49.693
So, what do I get for helping you out?

10:49.860 --> 10:51.862
- What do you have in mind?
- Giovanni's pizza.

10:52.071 --> 10:54.740
I haven't had a good margherita
pizza since I left New York.

10:54.948 --> 10:56.492
Yeah. I'm in.

10:56.658 --> 10:59.703
Did you know the margherita pizza
was named after Queen Margherita?

11:00.704 --> 11:04.208
Right. So I found the
source and radioed it in.

11:04.375 --> 11:07.086
I heard Kyle yell, "The pumps
are down." I'm like, "What?"

11:07.294 --> 11:11.090
Next thing I know, the trusses
collapse, I'm down for the count.

11:11.548 --> 11:14.510
But thanks to Jordan, I'm still here.

11:14.718 --> 11:15.719
To Jordan!

11:15.886 --> 11:17.930
- To Jordan!
- Yeah, Jordan!

11:19.890 --> 11:23.227
- Mm. I love this song. We have to dance.
- Unh!

11:23.393 --> 11:26.271
Hey, hey, Sarah. We don't have
to do everything all at once.

11:26.438 --> 11:28.816
Fine. We'll just dance.

11:31.485 --> 11:33.987
- Sarah.
- Come on, I wanna dance.

11:35.072 --> 11:38.033
♪ Couldn't rewind, too late ♪
♪ So much for fate ♪

11:38.200 --> 11:40.702
♪ So much for feeling the break ♪

11:40.869 --> 11:41.870
All right.

11:42.037 --> 11:43.664
♪ I just wanna break free ♪

11:44.164 --> 11:46.792
♪ Drive until the tank's on empty ♪

11:50.921 --> 11:53.215
Here we go. Here we
go. Train. Here we go.

11:53.382 --> 11:56.593
You ready? You ready to lead
us out? Wanna get that one on?

11:57.386 --> 11:59.346
Let me see you play.

12:02.474 --> 12:04.309
Yeah, okay, bedtime.

12:04.476 --> 12:07.104
Bedtime.

12:07.563 --> 12:09.064
- Hon.
- Oh. Uh-huh.

12:09.273 --> 12:11.358
- Yep.
- You're up.

12:13.944 --> 12:16.655
Wanna stick around? This
will only take an hour or two.

12:17.990 --> 12:20.220
Dinosaur? Yeah. All right.

12:20.221 --> 12:23.662
Here we go. Got your
dinosaur. All right.

12:24.830 --> 12:29.001
By the second book, I just look
at the pictures and make stuff up.

12:29.209 --> 12:32.504
- Come up with anything good?
- You know what? I gotta be honest.

12:32.671 --> 12:34.071
I'm pretty funny.

12:34.173 --> 12:36.758
It's Freddie the Fish time!

12:36.967 --> 12:38.552
Can I get you anything else, Trace?

12:38.719 --> 12:40.929
- Want more coffee? Pie?
- No, I am...

12:41.096 --> 12:42.306
- I'm fine.
- You sure?

12:42.639 --> 12:46.685
I should get going. Give Abby
a call before she goes to bed.

12:46.852 --> 12:51.481
- Oh. I understand.
- But thank you for an amazing meal.

12:51.648 --> 12:55.777
And when Freddie the Fish comes
up for air, thank him for me too.

12:55.944 --> 12:58.989
Of course. You're
welcome any time, Trace.

12:59.364 --> 13:01.241
And thank you.

13:04.953 --> 13:07.706
- Good night, Linda.
- Good night. I'll walk you out.

13:14.421 --> 13:18.133
"Suddenly, Freddie the Fish stopped.
He wasn't facing Squirrel Man.

13:18.300 --> 13:20.510
It was the evil Mr. Shoe.

13:20.677 --> 13:25.015
'Mr. Shoe, I thought you were still
trapped in your house of waffles.'"

13:36.902 --> 13:38.487
Hi, it's Abby. Leave a message.

13:38.654 --> 13:43.700
Hey, Abby, it's me. I was
just calling to say hi.

13:44.493 --> 13:46.161
I miss you.

14:00.849 --> 14:02.226
Hey.

14:02.560 --> 14:04.728
Uh, hey.

14:04.895 --> 14:08.899
- Your office told me you'd be here.
- Yeah, I have a breakfast meeting.

14:09.066 --> 14:12.069
- I'm second chair on that lawsuit now.
- They're lucky to have you.

14:13.696 --> 14:14.863
Have you got a minute?

14:16.740 --> 14:19.743
Connor, I'm asking you if
you have a minute for me.

14:20.744 --> 14:22.997
Well, you're here. Sure, have a seat.

14:23.497 --> 14:24.745
I came to drop this off.

14:24.746 --> 14:28.260
It's the discovery documents
from the trust settlement.

14:28.419 --> 14:32.756
- You could have left them at my office.
- You know me, face to face.

14:33.966 --> 14:36.100
If you have some free
time this afternoon

14:36.101 --> 14:37.680
you could come down to the marina.

14:38.095 --> 14:39.805
You planning on tearing it down?

14:39.972 --> 14:41.557
Put up an office building?

14:41.724 --> 14:43.559
Not today, but you never know.

14:43.767 --> 14:47.062
No, I got this side project and I
thought you'd like to check it out.

14:47.855 --> 14:50.858
Maybe, I don't know. I'll
have to check my schedule.

14:51.817 --> 14:54.778
Okay, well, whatever you want.

14:58.490 --> 15:00.659
I hope I'll see you this afternoon.

15:10.127 --> 15:12.338
- I can't believe the Pecks set me up like that.
- I know.

15:12.504 --> 15:13.923
- They lied to me.
- I know!

15:14.089 --> 15:18.135
I know what that feels like too.
I've been lied to by Simon Atwater.

15:18.344 --> 15:21.347
He's not British! I knew
that accent was fake.

15:21.513 --> 15:24.141
No, when he read the first
draft of the manuscript...

15:24.308 --> 15:27.311
... all he could talk about was
how much he loved it. And now...

15:27.478 --> 15:29.430
... everything he loved about
it, he wants me to change.

15:29.431 --> 15:31.523
He says it's not emotional.

15:31.732 --> 15:35.694
Emotional? You're like the most
emotional person I know. Besides me.

15:35.903 --> 15:39.323
- Thank you, sort of.
- Do you have to listen to him?

15:39.490 --> 15:41.361
I mean, he's here on his own, isn't he?

15:41.362 --> 15:43.000
What kind of editor comes to your house?

15:43.202 --> 15:44.745
Yeah, no, he...

15:44.912 --> 15:47.581
... totally just volunteered to help.

15:47.790 --> 15:51.669
What's annoying though is that
he's right a lot of the time.

15:51.877 --> 15:55.965
- So...
- Know what? We're gonna be fine, okay?

15:56.131 --> 15:59.718
We just need to stop stressing
about men and our problems with men.

15:59.885 --> 16:02.054
We need to focus on
what's good in our lives...

16:02.221 --> 16:03.695
... and that we are strong women.

16:03.696 --> 16:05.350
We are sisters and nothing can break...

16:05.516 --> 16:08.143
- ... the bonds of sisterhood.
- Yeah!

16:09.728 --> 16:11.313
That is... Sorry.

16:11.563 --> 16:14.817
Hello. Yes. Uh-huh.

16:15.025 --> 16:17.778
I will be right there.
Mm-hm. Okay, thanks.

16:17.987 --> 16:20.990
- What? We are the sisters, though.
- I have to go to work.

16:21.198 --> 16:23.867
- We were being strong.
- The three of us, not two.

16:24.034 --> 16:27.579
- Like this, together. Stronger together.
- Tripod. Strong...

16:28.706 --> 16:30.249
- Two.
- Like this.

16:30.416 --> 16:32.126
We have to be. We have no choice.

Heh. What'd you do,
make that up overnight?

17:32.895 --> 17:33.979
It was a long night.

17:35.189 --> 17:37.149
- Couldn't sleep.
- Wow.

17:37.524 --> 17:40.152
Well, I'm glad I didn't read
you a bedtime story then.

17:41.528 --> 17:43.655
- It's really good.
- Thanks.

17:43.822 --> 17:46.658
I change my vote from
"Bargain and Boots" to...

17:46.825 --> 17:49.286
- What's it called?
- It's called "Timeless."

17:50.788 --> 17:52.581
What'd you think, Leigh?

17:58.712 --> 18:01.131
Whoa, whoa. No, no,
no. Not that. Not that.

18:01.298 --> 18:03.675
The sled is emblematic
of the character's...

18:03.842 --> 18:07.513
... internal struggle for
self-discovery and acceptance.

18:07.679 --> 18:09.139
Right.

18:09.389 --> 18:11.809
Do you like winter sports?

18:11.975 --> 18:14.853
- Sledding and skating and such?
- Yes.

18:15.062 --> 18:18.148
Yes. I spent a semester
overseas in Copenhagen.

18:18.315 --> 18:20.470
Or "Copenhagen," as the
locals like to call it,

18:20.471 --> 18:21.571
and we spent all winter...

18:21.777 --> 18:25.114
No, no. That... That is
my favorite paragraph.

18:25.280 --> 18:28.315
Okay. For my own edification,

18:28.316 --> 18:30.160
is every paragraph
your favorite paragraph?

18:30.327 --> 18:33.539
Yes. I have a problem with
people editing my work.

18:33.747 --> 18:36.792
Evidently, but these,
they're just suggestions.

18:36.959 --> 18:38.502
I'm using a pencil.

18:39.211 --> 18:40.712
Okay, no, but wait!

18:40.879 --> 18:45.008
This was your favorite anecdote.
You called this smart...

18:45.175 --> 18:48.637
... and witty and brilliant.
But you do say "brilliant" a lot.

18:49.138 --> 18:50.433
It's an English thing.

18:50.434 --> 18:54.770
Just so you know, I did find it
witty, charming and brilliant.

18:54.977 --> 18:57.646
And I recommend you should
use it, but not here.

18:57.813 --> 18:59.523
- Ugh.
- In your next novel.

19:00.524 --> 19:03.277
Why are you really here, Simon?

19:03.443 --> 19:06.363
I was talking to Steve Kennedy,
who knows I brought your book in.

19:06.530 --> 19:07.975
And he said that you submitted

19:07.976 --> 19:10.450
eight different drafts
of your manuscript.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.619
They just wanna know
which one you wanna submit.

19:12.786 --> 19:14.454
So you're "just here to help"?

19:15.038 --> 19:16.039
At your service.

19:21.170 --> 19:23.338
Hey, so we're done, right?

19:23.505 --> 19:26.842
- I don't feel done.
- Look, five miles is done.

19:27.009 --> 19:28.594
I don't wanna stop.

19:28.844 --> 19:31.217
Maybe we could just, I don't
know, go out, get a beer.

19:31.218 --> 19:33.433
Talk a little bit. Chill.

19:33.599 --> 19:35.434
I was thinking maybe skydiving.

19:36.852 --> 19:39.646
- You can't be serious.
- You could teach me.

19:39.813 --> 19:43.358
- I saw your badge. Freefall parachutist.
- There were reasons for jumping.

19:43.525 --> 19:46.111
- Come on, it must've been fun.
- Not really. Hey. Hey.

19:46.278 --> 19:48.071
Look, look.

19:50.449 --> 19:53.327
Look, Sarah, I think you
need to slow down a bit.

19:53.493 --> 19:55.621
Ever since your accident, you've been...

19:55.913 --> 19:58.707
... a little intense.
I think you need to...

19:58.874 --> 20:01.126
I don't know, talk about
it. Kevin, I'm doing great.

20:04.171 --> 20:07.799
- I feel like... Like I can do anything.
- I know.

20:08.675 --> 20:10.385
Sarah, you...

20:11.428 --> 20:13.722
- You were almost...
- I don't wanna hear it.

20:14.431 --> 20:17.100
And if you don't wanna
share this with me...

20:18.477 --> 20:20.395
... I'll just do it on my own.

20:20.854 --> 20:22.689
Starting with another five.

20:33.867 --> 20:36.995
Leigh, what's up?

20:37.162 --> 20:40.499
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.168
It's just...

20:43.335 --> 20:45.295
... we always write
for the band together.

20:45.462 --> 20:49.341
Like I said, I couldn't
sleep, and I just...

20:51.426 --> 20:54.221
At least tell me what
you think. Honestly.

20:55.055 --> 20:56.765
Honestly...

20:57.474 --> 20:59.893
... I think it's one of the
best thing you've ever written.

21:03.438 --> 21:05.732
So "Timeless" it is.

21:20.914 --> 21:23.292
Leigh. Leigh.

21:26.378 --> 21:28.505
What's really going on here?

21:29.298 --> 21:32.342
We're a writing team,
right? We work together.

21:33.135 --> 21:35.220
Of course we're still a team, but...

21:35.387 --> 21:38.148
I mean, the song just came out This
has nothing to do with us, right?

21:44.354 --> 21:45.397
Trace...

21:46.773 --> 21:49.735
It's Abby. I gotta take this.

21:51.028 --> 21:52.070
Hey, Abs.

21:52.237 --> 21:55.949
- Sorry I missed your call last night.
- No, it's fine.

21:56.366 --> 21:58.869
- You sound tired.
- Mm. I didn't sleep.

21:59.953 --> 22:01.371
Yeah, me neither.

22:02.080 --> 22:05.500
Trace, I found another
picture of us online...

22:05.667 --> 22:07.919
... from when we were
saying goodbye in Dallas.

22:08.587 --> 22:11.548
I think maybe we need to
start being more careful.

22:12.090 --> 22:13.091
I am.

22:13.258 --> 22:14.926
That's what worries me.

22:15.093 --> 22:19.222
I am getting paranoid whenever I'm
out with the girls. I know I have...

22:19.389 --> 22:21.600
... no reason to be. I can't help it.

22:21.767 --> 22:23.352
I don't know what to say.

22:23.518 --> 22:27.481
- If I could stop these people, I would.
- Trace, this is serious.

22:27.647 --> 22:30.776
Okay, there are pictures
of my daughters online.

22:30.942 --> 22:32.319
There's pictures of us.

22:32.486 --> 22:35.989
The irony is every decision
I have made in the last year...

22:36.156 --> 22:40.202
... has been to give my daughters
a better life and to protect them.

22:40.368 --> 22:42.496
I feel like I'm doing the opposite.

22:42.662 --> 22:45.373
Abby, of course I want you to feel safe.

22:45.540 --> 22:47.990
And making sure that you
and the girls are secure,

22:47.991 --> 22:50.295
it's my number one priority.

22:50.462 --> 22:54.007
- But I don't know what else I can do.
- You keep saying that.

22:54.382 --> 22:57.427
But I'm just... I'm not
comfortable with this.

22:57.761 --> 23:01.890
I can't shake the feeling that
ultimately I'm responsible.

23:10.649 --> 23:11.983
So...

23:12.943 --> 23:15.112
- ... you have a sailboat?
- I do.

23:15.278 --> 23:17.155
Is this why you asked me here?

23:17.322 --> 23:20.325
I thought I could use a
little help on the hatch.

23:20.492 --> 23:22.911
I'm guessing Kevin was busy?

23:23.578 --> 23:26.123
I asked you. I didn't ask Kevin.

23:27.040 --> 23:30.168
- Who else knows about the sailboat?
- You and Thomas.

23:30.335 --> 23:33.630
- I've never sailed before.
- We can do that too.

23:34.881 --> 23:37.300
- Now I know why you asked me here.
- What do you mean?

23:37.467 --> 23:39.136
You do this every time.

23:39.302 --> 23:42.264
We never talk about what
we need to talk about.

23:42.430 --> 23:44.203
You invite me to share some secret,

23:44.204 --> 23:46.351
so I remember we have so much in common.

23:46.518 --> 23:49.646
I invited you here because
I thought you'd enjoy this.

23:49.813 --> 23:52.190
And I want to spend time with you.

23:52.357 --> 23:55.819
- That makes us fine? We're better?
- We're far from fine.

23:55.986 --> 23:59.489
I thought we could work on
the hatch and on the rigging.

23:59.656 --> 24:02.159
No, no, stop. I'm so tired of this.

24:02.325 --> 24:06.371
All we ever do is we fight, and
then we make up, and then we do this.

24:06.538 --> 24:09.300
We pretend that everything
is better between us.

24:09.301 --> 24:11.170
And then we just fight again.

24:11.585 --> 24:15.213
Connor, I'm just trying to figure
out a way to move past this.

24:15.380 --> 24:18.675
With you figuring out
how to get past this...

24:18.842 --> 24:21.136
... it's just going around in circles.

24:21.386 --> 24:23.221
And I'm not interested.

24:37.903 --> 24:39.988
- Okay, what now?
- Nothing.

24:40.155 --> 24:42.741
You haven't looked up
in an hour. What's up?

24:42.908 --> 24:44.910
Kacie's rather interesting.

24:45.076 --> 24:46.745
Oh, interesting how?

24:47.537 --> 24:51.541
Interesting in a character way. As
a protagonist, she is charming...

24:51.708 --> 24:54.294
- ... lovely, seemingly warm.
- "Seemingly warm"?

24:54.461 --> 24:57.255
I loved how you
described her on page 42.

24:57.422 --> 25:01.760
The anecdote about her not letting
go of her VW Beetle for six years...

25:01.927 --> 25:04.262
... even though it never ran. That...

25:04.429 --> 25:07.307
That says more about
her than all those words.

25:07.474 --> 25:09.684
It says she really likes her old car.

25:10.060 --> 25:14.439
"The car was unfixable." Page 72.

25:14.606 --> 25:16.107
Where are you?

25:16.942 --> 25:20.237

- The problem was me.

25:21.238 --> 25:23.531
- The problem was me.
- Bree.

Cool.

26:02.529 --> 26:05.657
All right. Excuse me a
second. I'm gonna make a call.

26:11.830 --> 26:14.207
Hey, Bree? It's Trace.

26:16.876 --> 26:19.462
Listen, I need to ask you a favor.

26:20.130 --> 26:22.007
So how's Sarah doing?

26:22.841 --> 26:25.010
- She's fine.
- Yeah?

26:25.176 --> 26:29.097
In the past two days, we've
gone running twice, bouldering...

26:29.264 --> 26:32.475
... a swim in the bay, and
now she wants to skydive.

26:32.767 --> 26:34.936
Heh. Wow.

26:36.938 --> 26:38.398
Kev...

26:39.232 --> 26:40.608
... she sounds like...

26:40.775 --> 26:42.277
- Like me?
- Yeah.

26:42.444 --> 26:43.987
Yeah, I know.

26:45.155 --> 26:46.990
Have you said something?

26:47.157 --> 26:48.830
I don't think it would
make a difference.

26:48.831 --> 26:52.162
I didn't listen to
anyone when I got hurt.

26:53.997 --> 26:56.583
I survived, Mom.

26:57.042 --> 26:59.627
I put blinders on. The last
thing I wanted to think about...

26:59.794 --> 27:02.047
... was what would happen if I didn't.

27:02.839 --> 27:05.925
But if she's pushing this
hard, she's gonna hurt herself.

27:07.260 --> 27:08.636
I know.

27:10.472 --> 27:14.392
Kev, I can't begin to
know what you went through.

27:14.893 --> 27:17.220
But I do know the more
you pretended to be okay,

27:17.221 --> 27:19.481
the more scared we got.

27:20.940 --> 27:22.567
Yeah, I know.

27:29.532 --> 27:34.412
What if I just call up the Pecks
and ask them to have a sit-down.

27:34.579 --> 27:37.832
I could bring a fruit platter.
They eat a lot of papaya.

27:37.999 --> 27:40.251
They did, didn't they.

27:40.919 --> 27:44.130
Unfortunately, Simon is
really helping me with my book.

27:44.297 --> 27:46.174
- Isn't that good?
- Yeah, but...

27:46.341 --> 27:48.330
As much as I love having you girls

27:48.331 --> 27:50.720
come visit me at work, why are you here?

27:51.346 --> 27:54.641
- We were in the neighborhood.
- Our neighborhood is an hour away.

27:54.808 --> 27:59.813
We thought you always take care of
us, so we should take care of you.

28:00.313 --> 28:04.317
- And then maybe everything will be okay.
- It's okay. It's gonna be fine.

28:04.484 --> 28:07.862
I'm okay with the
pictures and everything.

28:08.029 --> 28:10.240
I mean, they're just pictures, right?

28:10.407 --> 28:13.410
It's not a big deal. I need
to stop thinking about...

28:13.576 --> 28:15.036
Hey, Abs.

28:15.370 --> 28:16.871
Heh. Hi.

28:18.248 --> 28:19.916
What are you doing here?

28:20.166 --> 28:22.043
I was in the neighborhood.

28:22.210 --> 28:24.587
- Thought you could use a break.
- Liars.

28:24.754 --> 28:26.172
- Bye.
- Bye.

28:28.133 --> 28:30.593

29:30.612 --> 29:33.156
We finished. I had a car
take me to the airport.

29:33.323 --> 29:35.992
Caught the last flight to
Baltimore, then a taxi here.

29:36.159 --> 29:39.204
And I have another radio
interview at 10:00 in the morning.

29:39.370 --> 29:43.291
- We have an hour before I have to leave.
- That's crazy.

29:43.458 --> 29:44.751
Probably.

29:44.918 --> 29:47.629
But I didn't want to have
to make up over the phone.

29:50.256 --> 29:53.218
We weren't fighting. I just...

29:55.178 --> 29:58.723
I want to protect Carrie,
Caitlyn and us. I don't know how.

29:58.890 --> 30:01.059
Well, we'll figure it out...

30:01.392 --> 30:02.894
... together.

30:03.061 --> 30:06.147
Well, I'm sorry that I
got so upset last night.

30:06.314 --> 30:08.691
I just was worried and was missing you.

30:08.858 --> 30:10.068
Don't worry.

30:10.235 --> 30:11.778
I get it.

30:12.195 --> 30:13.530
It's hard.

30:13.696 --> 30:14.906
Yeah.

30:16.282 --> 30:19.536
I can't believe you came
here just to sing me a song.

30:19.702 --> 30:23.039
And to let you know that you are
the most important person in my life.

30:23.206 --> 30:27.919
And I know I keep saying that, so
I figured this time I'd show you.

30:28.503 --> 30:29.796
Face to face.

30:31.256 --> 30:32.298
Face to face.

30:39.514 --> 30:41.975
I love this place.

30:42.142 --> 30:44.728
I remember the first time
we came here. I was 21.

30:44.894 --> 30:46.771
- Mm-hm. You forgot your wallet.
- Yeah.

30:46.980 --> 30:48.995
Found a payphone, called my father.

30:48.996 --> 30:51.410
He waited outside while
I snuck out to get it.

30:51.568 --> 30:54.195
- I knew what was going on.
- I knew you knew.

30:54.362 --> 30:58.158
I was grateful you didn't say
anything. I don't think I told you.

30:58.325 --> 31:00.707
Dad slipped a 20 in
my wallet that night.

31:00.708 --> 31:02.370
He was always very fond of you.

31:02.871 --> 31:06.082
Your dad, he was always easy on me.

31:06.249 --> 31:07.459
Yes, he was.

31:07.625 --> 31:09.252
- And tough on you.
- Mm.

31:11.671 --> 31:15.425
- I think you and Connor...
- Don't make this about me and Connor.

31:16.343 --> 31:19.387
- I'm just trying to help.
- I know, but you can't.

31:19.554 --> 31:21.723
That was something I had
to work out with my father.

31:21.890 --> 31:24.225
This is something Connor
has to work out with me.

31:24.392 --> 31:28.813
- So here's to working things out?
- Sooner rather than later.

31:28.980 --> 31:30.482
Amen to that.

31:31.524 --> 31:35.320
- Would you like to look at the menu?
- We have talked about what we want.

31:35.487 --> 31:39.115
We're gonna have two margherita
pizzas with hot pepper flakes.

31:39.282 --> 31:41.618
- And extra cheese, please.
- Sure thing.

31:41.785 --> 31:43.495
- Yeah.
- Perfect. Sounds good.

31:43.661 --> 31:44.954
Thank you.

31:45.789 --> 31:48.541
I think it's great
what you two are doing.

31:48.708 --> 31:50.710
My parents still go out on dates too.

31:59.386 --> 32:01.554
- Right there. Mm-mm-mm.
- Mm.

32:02.305 --> 32:05.892
Ah, pie is how I figure things out.

32:06.059 --> 32:08.561
- You mean with David?
- No, with everything.

32:08.728 --> 32:09.960
I don't know what I was thinking.

32:09.961 --> 32:11.940
David and I are never gonna be together.

32:12.107 --> 32:13.490
We're like Romeo and Juliet,

32:13.491 --> 32:15.610
only more depressing because
we're both still alive.

32:15.777 --> 32:19.072
- But you feel dead inside.
- That's very deep.

32:19.239 --> 32:20.782
I do deep well.

32:20.949 --> 32:24.285
- I've had to a lot with Dad.
- You must be deeply in deep.

32:24.452 --> 32:26.663
- Oh, yeah.
- It's more fun being angry.

32:26.830 --> 32:28.790
Yeah, I get that too but tiring.

32:30.917 --> 32:33.044
I don't know if Dad
and I are gonna make up.

32:33.503 --> 32:36.172
Maybe you already have
and you don't know it.

32:36.339 --> 32:38.270
Maybe you're so used to being angry

32:38.271 --> 32:40.970
you don't know how to be anything else.

32:41.136 --> 32:43.763
Should I forget
everything that's happened?

32:43.930 --> 32:47.976
No, you just do what I did
with Mom. Focus on the now.

32:48.726 --> 32:51.187
Because the "then" has never been good.

32:51.896 --> 32:54.441
What are we gonna do
when we run out of pie?

32:54.607 --> 32:58.278
- We'll have to be okay with all of this.
- Or order another pie.

32:58.736 --> 33:00.113
Now that's deep.

- Yeah. No, it's me. It's, um...

33:46.576 --> 33:49.204
I'm just having some
trouble with the words.

33:49.662 --> 33:51.560
It's been my experience

33:51.561 --> 33:54.000
writers never have trouble
just finding the words.

33:54.167 --> 33:55.960
It's finding the right ones.

33:57.045 --> 33:58.129

I'm Kacie.

34:15.063 --> 34:17.148
... everything you said about me...

34:17.315 --> 34:20.735
... emotionally protecting
myself by buying the wrong car...

34:20.902 --> 34:26.491
... or the wrong guy or Martin,
or whatever, that is true.

34:26.658 --> 34:28.368
That's what I do.

34:28.534 --> 34:31.079
I've been thinking
about that all afternoon.

34:32.789 --> 34:35.875
I was insensitive. And
I am sorry if I hurt you.

34:37.085 --> 34:39.504
I'm sorry, um...

34:39.670 --> 34:41.047
... if I've been unfair.

34:42.422 --> 34:44.634
You came here to help.

34:44.801 --> 34:46.733
I mean, all you've ever done is helped.

34:46.734 --> 34:49.722
And all I've ever done is push you away.

34:53.935 --> 34:57.063
Ahem. It's where I
feel most comfortable.

35:00.525 --> 35:02.527
Did you want to say something too?

35:03.570 --> 35:05.071
Well...

35:06.072 --> 35:08.866
... I was just gonna
ask if you wanted a pint.

35:11.661 --> 35:12.704
Brilliant.

35:15.290 --> 35:17.250
One more please.

35:26.175 --> 35:27.844
Hey, you made it.

35:28.011 --> 35:29.679
This is gonna be fun.

35:29.846 --> 35:31.306
Yeah.

35:31.472 --> 35:33.683
Sarah, I'm not going.

35:33.850 --> 35:35.810
What? Why?

35:36.436 --> 35:39.522
I know what you're doing
because I did it too.

35:40.898 --> 35:44.319
After my accident, after I
knew that I was gonna be okay...

35:44.611 --> 35:47.572
... what I felt was amazing.

35:47.739 --> 35:50.783
food, music...

35:50.950 --> 35:54.912
... the sky even looked
different somehow.

35:55.121 --> 35:57.540
It just felt like there was
nothing that I couldn't do.

35:57.707 --> 36:00.585
And I did some really silly things.

36:00.918 --> 36:02.545
Skydiving isn't silly.

36:02.712 --> 36:04.922
No, it's not about that.

36:05.965 --> 36:08.760
You can't go from high to high.

36:09.385 --> 36:13.056
At some point, it's gonna hit
you why you're really doing it.

36:14.015 --> 36:15.933
I'm doing this to celebrate.

36:16.934 --> 36:18.436
Maybe.

36:20.521 --> 36:22.315
I did it because I was scared.

36:24.067 --> 36:25.526
Terrified...

36:26.194 --> 36:27.236
... actually.

36:29.739 --> 36:32.617
Because for a moment, I
thought I was gonna die.

36:36.329 --> 36:38.289
There's nothing I could do.

36:54.597 --> 36:56.891
I thought I was gonna die too.

37:24.968 --> 37:27.554
Dad, this boat's in pretty rough shape.

37:33.727 --> 37:35.645
It does need a little work.

37:36.354 --> 37:37.731
A lot of it.

37:37.939 --> 37:41.151
It'll all be worth it
once I get her under sail.

37:43.862 --> 37:46.406
So, uh, where do you want me to start?

37:47.407 --> 37:49.784
Maybe with the ropes?

37:50.827 --> 37:52.537
Actually...

37:52.704 --> 37:55.874
... they're only called
ropes until they're in place.

37:56.332 --> 37:58.575
Once they're in place,
we call them lines,

37:58.576 --> 38:00.720
or sheets, or halyards or downhauls.

38:00.879 --> 38:03.298
This, for instance, is the main sheet.

38:03.840 --> 38:06.926
- Why do they call it that?
- You know, I have no idea.

38:08.845 --> 38:11.097
- You know how to tie a bowline?
- No.

38:11.556 --> 38:15.268
- Don't know much about boats, do you?
- Well, no.

38:15.435 --> 38:16.811
No one was there to teach me.

38:24.944 --> 38:26.571
I'm sorry.

38:29.574 --> 38:31.076
Thank you.

38:33.203 --> 38:36.456
Well, you wanna teach
me how to tie that knot?

38:37.540 --> 38:39.793
Sure. Come on board.

38:40.293 --> 38:41.753
All right.

38:43.755 --> 38:46.674
Actually, the bowline
is one of the greatest...

38:46.841 --> 38:50.456
... and yet the simplest
knot since nautical history.

38:50.457 --> 38:51.638
Pretty straightforward.

38:55.683 --> 38:57.894
Okay. All right.

38:59.896 --> 39:02.065
Okay, so we're done, right?

39:03.024 --> 39:05.276
We're not doing another 10 miles?

39:05.443 --> 39:08.154
- That's it.
- Oh, I love you.

39:11.491 --> 39:15.537
I mean, no. I love
that we're done running.

39:15.703 --> 39:17.038
And...

39:18.081 --> 39:19.666
You know what?

39:20.208 --> 39:21.626
I do.

39:24.921 --> 39:25.964
I love you.

39:27.048 --> 39:28.508
I love you.

39:29.926 --> 39:31.970
And that we're done running.

39:32.887 --> 39:34.139
So...

39:34.848 --> 39:37.267
- ... we love each other.
- Yeah.

39:37.433 --> 39:39.144
Yeah, I guess we do.

39:46.442 --> 39:48.945
More running? Come on!

39:49.279 --> 39:50.321
Right here.

39:51.072 --> 39:52.075
I mean, I don't know.

39:52.076 --> 39:55.827
I think the VW bit is redundant.
I think we can trim it.

39:56.161 --> 39:57.495
It's up to you.

39:57.662 --> 40:02.333
Oh. Are you saying that as my
editor, or whatever you are?

40:02.500 --> 40:05.086
What am I? That's a good question.

40:05.795 --> 40:08.570
I do know I'm your Wallace.

40:08.571 --> 40:11.510
Your marine biologist with
a penchant for flounder.

40:11.676 --> 40:13.595
Does that bother you?

40:13.761 --> 40:15.889
On the contrary, I'm flattered.

40:16.931 --> 40:18.850
He does grow on you.

40:21.603 --> 40:24.689
You know what, I say...

40:25.440 --> 40:27.150
... trim the bug.

40:27.317 --> 40:30.320
It's time I get a car
I don't need to repair.

40:30.486 --> 40:33.435
Well, you know, there are some excellent

40:33.436 --> 40:36.245
late-model British cars on the market.

40:37.076 --> 40:40.330
I do like Aston Martins.

40:40.914 --> 40:43.458
I wonder if Daniel Craig is available.

40:43.625 --> 40:45.585
- Still married.
- Hm.

40:45.752 --> 40:47.670
Daniel Radcliffe?

40:48.046 --> 40:49.881
He drove a broom.

40:53.718 --> 40:54.886
- Noted.
- Right.

40:55.345 --> 40:58.139
New plants, new beginnings.

40:59.098 --> 41:01.090
You know, I think I finally understand

41:01.091 --> 41:02.953
why Gran likes gardening so much.

41:03.820 --> 41:06.606
It slows everything
down. It's cathartic.

41:06.773 --> 41:08.942
It always gives me time to think.

41:09.108 --> 41:12.654
And try not to make
things what they're not.

41:12.820 --> 41:14.822
And you're over David?

41:14.989 --> 41:19.035
No, but I haven't thought about
him in about 42 minutes, so...

41:19.202 --> 41:20.954
- Until I mentioned him.
- Yeah.

41:21.120 --> 41:22.664
Sorry about that.

41:22.830 --> 41:24.666
Oh, more guests.

41:30.171 --> 41:32.423
Jess O'Brien...

41:32.882 --> 41:35.969
- David.
- ... I think you forgot something.

41:43.434 --> 41:45.353
It fits.

41:45.645 --> 41:47.335
I don't know if you're still
in the market for a cook,

41:47.336 --> 41:50.650
gardener, handyman, anything.

41:51.567 --> 41:53.861
But I'd like to submit my application.

41:54.570 --> 41:57.407
- Do you have any references?
- Just one.

41:58.408 --> 42:00.702
I missed her more than anything.

42:12.922 --> 42:15.967
You know who makes a good
burger? Paulies in Philly.

42:16.134 --> 42:18.720
- Remember that?
- Yeah. Best plate of fries.

42:18.886 --> 42:20.555
Now, was that ketchup or barbecue sauce?

42:22.390 --> 42:24.267
You boys all set?

42:28.396 --> 42:29.480
You coming, John?

42:31.399 --> 42:34.360
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'm gonna miss you.

42:36.904 --> 42:39.157
- Be back soon.
- Yeah.

42:41.951 --> 42:43.870
- Let's do this.
- Yep.
