00:02.518 --> 00:04.474
Here's your fish of the day.

00:04.539 --> 00:06.251
That day is last Monday.

00:07.557 --> 00:08.724
Excuse me, miss?

00:09.720 --> 00:12.156
There's a hair in my meatloaf.

00:12.157 --> 00:13.861
This never happens.

00:13.862 --> 00:15.529
Oleg!

00:15.530 --> 00:18.332
We got a H-34 at T-2!

00:18.333 --> 00:19.867
A hair? That's impossible.

00:19.868 --> 00:21.501
Let me put some pants on.

00:24.038 --> 00:25.973
I am so sorry

00:25.974 --> 00:28.576
that you ordered the meatloaf.

00:28.577 --> 00:30.211
Shouldn't he be in a hairnet?

00:30.212 --> 00:32.177
He should be in a prison.

00:34.648 --> 00:36.951
Good news.

00:36.952 --> 00:39.486
It's not mine.

00:39.487 --> 00:41.989
That Propecia's really paying off.

00:41.990 --> 00:44.825
Obviously, it's not mine. I'm blonde.

00:44.826 --> 00:47.294
You're not blonde everywhere.

00:47.295 --> 00:49.663
I love carpet-and-drapes talk.

00:49.664 --> 00:51.031
I want my money back.

00:51.032 --> 00:52.465
Me too.

00:54.401 --> 00:56.570
Well, it ain't mine.

00:56.571 --> 00:58.405
Last time my hair was this long,

00:58.406 --> 01:01.976
I was a back-up dancer on Solid Gold.

01:01.977 --> 01:03.377
Han!

01:03.378 --> 01:05.001
We got a customer
with a hair up his butt

01:05.001 --> 01:06.513
and one in his meatloaf.

01:06.514 --> 01:07.514
Step aside.

01:07.515 --> 01:09.683
Let an expert through.

01:09.684 --> 01:13.554
Look, it's "Law and Order: SAD."

01:13.555 --> 01:17.391
It's brown, somewhere between
coffee and burnt sienna,

01:17.392 --> 01:22.062
cleaned hastily with a
combination shampoo-body wash.

01:22.063 --> 01:25.699
Mm, this hair belongs
to a single white man

01:25.700 --> 01:29.436
alone, and not by choice,
but so set in his ways...

01:29.437 --> 01:31.238
Okay!

01:31.239 --> 01:33.340
It's mine!

01:33.341 --> 01:35.042
Next time you want a free meal,

01:35.043 --> 01:36.510
order the fish of the day.

01:36.511 --> 01:37.944
Am I right, ma'am?

01:45.590 --> 01:52.191
<font color="#33FF00">Subtitle sync and corrections by
<b>awaqeded</b> for <b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

02:00.513 --> 02:02.614
Hey, can I order something?

02:02.615 --> 02:04.449
I'm gonna need to see some ID.

02:04.450 --> 02:06.113
I'm getting the itch
to hit the road again

02:06.114 --> 02:07.685
and I'll need a new identity.

02:07.686 --> 02:10.187
I'll have a Moscow Mule.

02:10.189 --> 02:12.457
Uh, how about a Jolly Rancher shot?

02:12.458 --> 02:13.921
They're one of our signature drinks,

02:13.922 --> 02:17.195
served with a side of my finger-guns.

02:17.196 --> 02:18.863
How about a Moscow Mule

02:18.864 --> 02:21.199
since that's what I just ordered?

02:21.200 --> 02:22.967
Oh, are you sure?

02:22.968 --> 02:25.470
The shot glasses are made
of actual Jolly Ranchers.

02:25.471 --> 02:26.937
Kids love 'em.

02:29.174 --> 02:31.943
One Moscow Mule coming up.

02:31.944 --> 02:34.345
All righty.

02:34.346 --> 02:35.947
You don't know how to make one, do you?

02:35.948 --> 02:37.415
No clue.

02:37.416 --> 02:39.184
How 'bout I just make it myself?

02:39.185 --> 02:42.320
Hmm, while you're at it,
I'll have a Jack and Coke.

02:42.321 --> 02:44.856
Always wanted to know what was in that.

02:44.857 --> 02:47.559
Max, what's that guy doing behind you?

02:47.560 --> 02:48.494
Oh...

02:48.495 --> 02:50.895
You know I never look
when they're back there.

02:50.896 --> 02:53.364
Look, you can't let
people serve themselves.

02:53.365 --> 02:56.601
Again, not everything
is a Hometown Buffet.

02:56.602 --> 02:59.437
Uh, if it were, I'd be eating a biscuit

02:59.438 --> 03:02.040
with macaroni and pudding on top.

03:02.041 --> 03:04.242
People aren't ordering
our signature drinks.

03:04.243 --> 03:05.710
They want real ones, and I only know

03:05.711 --> 03:07.312
how to make the stuff on the menu.

03:07.313 --> 03:10.381
And Molly lollipops,
which I call "Mollipops."

03:10.382 --> 03:12.283
Then let me do it.

03:12.284 --> 03:15.852
And is that why I slept for
three days after Halloween?

03:17.322 --> 03:18.623
Can I get a greyhound?

03:18.624 --> 03:21.125
Greyhound...

03:21.126 --> 03:22.293
Oh...

03:22.294 --> 03:25.463
I don't drive for them anymore.

03:25.464 --> 03:26.997
Politics!

03:28.299 --> 03:29.868
Uh, you heard the man.

03:29.869 --> 03:32.070
We're not paying you
to just stand around.

03:32.071 --> 03:34.172
You're not paying me at all.

03:34.173 --> 03:36.574
Not with that attitude.

03:36.575 --> 03:39.377
Believe me, if we could afford
a bartender, we'd hire one.

03:39.378 --> 03:41.912
This obviously isn't
working out for either of us.

03:43.414 --> 03:45.517
Ahem!

03:45.518 --> 03:48.218
Was there a problem with your service?

03:50.688 --> 03:53.057
Max, we need to talk about
what happened last night.

03:53.058 --> 03:55.525
Oh, crap, you said you were on the pill.

03:57.095 --> 03:58.730
We need someone at the dessert bar

03:58.731 --> 04:00.532
who knows how to make real drinks.

04:00.533 --> 04:03.001
Not that your "cigarette butt and tonic"

04:03.002 --> 04:04.903
wasn't a hit.

04:04.904 --> 04:06.871
You said we couldn't
afford a bartender...

04:06.872 --> 04:08.106
or a mechanical bull,

04:08.107 --> 04:09.874
which would have paid for itself by now.

04:09.875 --> 04:11.709
Here's my idea.

04:11.710 --> 04:14.779
We are going to bartending
school so we can...

04:14.780 --> 04:16.414
and don't kick me... be the best...

04:16.415 --> 04:17.749
no pinching, not my nose...

04:17.750 --> 04:18.950
business we can be!

04:18.951 --> 04:20.584
- G'doink.
- Oh.

04:20.586 --> 04:22.754
You didn't say anything about G'doinks.

04:22.755 --> 04:24.722
What do you think? 'Cause we're already

04:24.723 --> 04:26.357
signed up and it's non-refundable.

04:26.358 --> 04:28.092
I took your share out
of your piggy bong.

04:29.194 --> 04:31.462
You stole from Cheech and Change?

04:33.632 --> 04:36.534
Okay, you can say you hate the idea,

04:36.535 --> 04:38.303
but you don't have to cry about it.

04:38.304 --> 04:40.872
Man, this baby's more full of crap

04:40.873 --> 04:43.274
than a Coldplay album.

04:43.275 --> 04:46.878
Fine, I'll change your
diaper, but when you grow up,

04:46.879 --> 04:50.315
you're going to have
to return the favor.

04:50.316 --> 04:52.349
The diaper goes the other way!

04:54.118 --> 04:56.054
Earl, did that doll just talk

04:56.055 --> 04:58.122
or are the voices
telling me to kill again?

04:58.123 --> 05:00.792
No, no, it's been yelling at me all day.

05:00.793 --> 05:02.727
Between this and the police chatter

05:02.728 --> 05:04.128
I pick up on my hearing aid,

05:04.129 --> 05:07.264
it's like a damn party in my head.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.802
Roger that.

05:10.803 --> 05:13.438
Can this doll get any creepier?

05:13.439 --> 05:15.306
Takes one to know one, Caroline.

05:15.307 --> 05:17.475
Asked and answered.

05:17.476 --> 05:19.177
Hey.

05:19.178 --> 05:21.646
Can't a lady have a smoke and a tinkle

05:21.647 --> 05:23.615
without having to worry about her baby?

05:23.616 --> 05:26.184
You were watching us from the toilet?

05:26.185 --> 05:28.953
Can't you just hold your nose
and hover like everyone else?

05:28.954 --> 05:33.424
It's my surveillance doll. Look.

05:33.425 --> 05:36.127
It's hooked up to an app in my phone.

05:36.128 --> 05:38.029
Look, she's got

05:38.030 --> 05:40.098
cameras in her eyeballs;

05:40.099 --> 05:42.333
she's got a microphone in her mouth;

05:42.334 --> 05:46.170
and look, a laser pointer in her butt.

05:46.171 --> 05:49.941
Is that the American Girl
Doll PATRIOT Act edition?

05:49.942 --> 05:51.943
Isn't she cute?

05:51.944 --> 05:54.445
Look, she's like my twin,

05:54.446 --> 05:56.213
only more alive.

05:59.350 --> 06:00.785
Thank you

06:00.786 --> 06:03.388
for keeping your eye on Barbara.

06:03.389 --> 06:05.589
Aww.

06:06.557 --> 06:08.793
Well, thanks so much.

06:08.794 --> 06:12.196
I'd pay you, but I know you're
too proud to take the money.

06:12.197 --> 06:15.066
Uh, actually, the medical
bills are piling up, Sophie.

06:15.067 --> 06:17.334
- Well, see you later!
- And I could really use...

06:18.903 --> 06:22.807
If you need a free babysitter, that guy.

06:22.808 --> 06:24.509
Is it just me

06:24.510 --> 06:27.277
or is it hot and blurry in here?

06:28.479 --> 06:30.415
Pardon me, sir.

06:30.416 --> 06:32.417
Oh, my God, Han.

06:32.418 --> 06:34.686
You're covered in spots
and you're delirious.

06:34.687 --> 06:36.421
You have chicken pox.

06:36.422 --> 06:39.190
You also have chicken legs,
so I guess you're even.

06:39.191 --> 06:40.758
Han, you have to go home.

06:40.759 --> 06:41.759
You're contagious.

06:41.760 --> 06:43.895
And not like my laugh.

06:48.666 --> 06:51.269
Welcome to the Dinersburg Williams.

06:51.270 --> 06:52.937
Who said that?

06:52.938 --> 06:55.406
You did! You have to go home.

06:55.407 --> 06:58.142
Well, I suppose I could get into bed

06:58.143 --> 07:00.578
and Hulu a little Mindy Project.

07:00.579 --> 07:02.747
And, boy, is she a project.

07:06.684 --> 07:08.853
Han looked pretty unsteady.

07:08.854 --> 07:11.122
Do you think someone should
make sure he gets home okay?

07:11.123 --> 07:12.956
Don't worry so much. He'll be fine.

07:20.198 --> 07:22.232
See? Fine.

07:25.103 --> 07:27.205
I know this is just bartending class,

07:27.206 --> 07:29.540
but gum, please?

07:29.541 --> 07:32.075
That was chewing tobacco, FYI.

07:33.644 --> 07:35.980
We need to take this seriously, Max.

07:35.981 --> 07:38.549
Is that a pocket knife?

07:38.550 --> 07:40.251
Uh, yeah.

07:40.252 --> 07:41.619
How are they gonna know I was here

07:41.620 --> 07:44.088
if I can't carve my
initials in the desk?

07:44.089 --> 07:46.591
Maybe we should sit at
separate workstations.

07:46.592 --> 07:48.659
I'm obviously gonna
be the top student here

07:48.660 --> 07:50.495
and I don't want to
be associated with your

07:50.496 --> 07:52.597
"rebel without health
insurance" attitude.

07:52.598 --> 07:55.165
Fine, smell you later.

07:57.335 --> 07:58.469
Hi.

07:58.470 --> 07:59.570
I haven't been in a class

07:59.571 --> 08:01.172
since I graduated from Wharton.

08:01.173 --> 08:04.275
- It's an Ivy League...
- I went to Harvard.

08:04.276 --> 08:07.512
Wharton was my safety school.

08:07.513 --> 08:10.314
Max, do you still
have that pocket knife?

08:10.315 --> 08:13.684
Okay, I think everyone is here.

08:13.685 --> 08:16.354
Hi, my name is Gil Bronski

08:16.355 --> 08:19.457
and I am in no rush to go home.

08:19.458 --> 08:22.326
I live with my mother
and her three cats,

08:22.327 --> 08:24.462
two of whom have diarrhea.

08:30.701 --> 08:32.636
I thought it was an icebreaker.

08:32.638 --> 08:34.938
No, it's a carpet-ruiner.

08:36.041 --> 08:38.809
Oh, thanks, Julie.

08:38.811 --> 08:40.477
Julie's killing it.

08:41.946 --> 08:43.815
Now, you're probably all wondering,

08:43.816 --> 08:46.117
"How did this former child actor

08:46.118 --> 08:49.520
"briefly sidelined by
a 30-year drug addiction

08:49.521 --> 08:52.356
find himself teaching
bartending school?"

08:52.357 --> 08:53.558
Just got lucky?

08:53.559 --> 08:56.360
Just got lucky!

08:56.361 --> 08:59.397
Now, who can answer this?

08:59.398 --> 09:02.834
He hasn't asked it yet, ass-kissers.

09:02.835 --> 09:07.338
Churchill declared war while
sipping a Long Island Iced Tea.

09:07.339 --> 09:10.074
The Magna Carta, French Revolution,

09:10.075 --> 09:11.709
my three divorces,

09:11.710 --> 09:13.377
what's the common denominator?

09:13.378 --> 09:15.012
Booze, duh.

09:15.013 --> 09:17.849
Booze, duh!

09:17.850 --> 09:20.418
She didn't raise her hand.

09:20.419 --> 09:24.155
Boy, we have got some eager
beavers here, don't we?

09:24.156 --> 09:28.326
Ha, that's what my pimp told
us at our working brunch.

09:28.327 --> 09:30.428
Now...

09:30.429 --> 09:32.597
I have only one rule.

09:32.598 --> 09:33.831
No...

09:34.833 --> 09:37.435
Interruptions.

09:37.436 --> 09:40.338
This is crazy; no one has
called me in six years.

09:40.339 --> 09:42.440
I would have guessed longer.

09:44.243 --> 09:46.710
Oh! Thanks, Julie.

09:47.712 --> 09:50.047
Let's make some drinks!

09:50.048 --> 09:53.083
Oh, my God. I love school so much.

10:00.624 --> 10:02.292
How am I expected to know the difference

10:02.293 --> 10:05.301
between a vodka sunrise
and a vodka sunset?

10:05.302 --> 10:09.038
12 hours and a missing pair of pants.

10:09.039 --> 10:10.839
Now, shh. I'm studying.

10:13.476 --> 10:16.145
That was the first
homework I've ever done.

10:16.146 --> 10:19.349
I've never seen you take
anything this seriously.

10:19.350 --> 10:22.051
And you had rabies once.

10:22.052 --> 10:24.886
Stop joking around. This is for school.

10:28.358 --> 10:31.995
Where did you get those
glasses, The Golden Girls?

10:31.996 --> 10:35.531
For the first time in my
life, I want to learn goodly.

10:35.532 --> 10:39.302
Max, have we switched bodies?

10:39.303 --> 10:41.837
If so, enjoy chlamydia.

10:44.007 --> 10:46.209
I want to do well on this test.

10:46.210 --> 10:48.678
I want to get a, uh...

10:48.679 --> 10:50.680
what's the good letter?

10:50.681 --> 10:52.515
It's an A.

10:52.516 --> 10:55.351
And I think this is gonna be
the first time I don't get one.

10:55.352 --> 10:58.087
I am just not connecting
to the material.

10:58.088 --> 11:01.891
Like sci-fi comedy,
I mean, pick a lane.

11:01.892 --> 11:03.526
Well, give me that book

11:03.527 --> 11:05.561
'cause I'm gonna nail
this bartending exam

11:05.562 --> 11:09.432
like it's some guy I
met at the grocery store.

11:09.433 --> 11:13.403
Most of my tests just had
"see me" written at the top.

11:13.404 --> 11:15.071
Mine always had,

11:15.072 --> 11:17.707
"You've done it again,
Caroline Channing."

11:17.708 --> 11:19.842
And I have to do it again.
Let me try making a drink.

11:19.843 --> 11:21.711
Okay. Bartender?

11:21.712 --> 11:23.179
Make me a Bloody Mary.

11:23.180 --> 11:24.714
The drink, not my friend Mary Nichol

11:24.715 --> 11:26.749
who got her period in fourth grade.

11:26.750 --> 11:28.017
I have to get this.

11:28.018 --> 11:30.086
I know the bloody part is tomato juice,

11:30.087 --> 11:31.888
but what the hell is the Mary?

11:31.889 --> 11:34.624
I should know. I've dated so many.

11:34.625 --> 11:36.059
I'll give you a hint.

11:36.060 --> 11:38.628
Rhymes with "schmodka."

11:38.629 --> 11:40.897
Grodka!

11:40.898 --> 11:43.466
That's not even a thing.
What is wrong with me?

11:43.467 --> 11:46.702
Vodka.

11:46.703 --> 11:48.637
Um, that was clam juice.

11:50.706 --> 11:51.940
Sure was.

11:52.975 --> 11:55.044
Pick up, hot...

11:55.045 --> 11:57.313
doll.

11:57.314 --> 11:58.581
The Sophie doll?

11:58.582 --> 11:59.949
Well, it's covered in hair

11:59.950 --> 12:01.884
so it'll pass as food around here.

12:01.885 --> 12:03.453
Just get rid of it.

12:03.454 --> 12:05.955
Sophie's constantly
using it to criticize me,

12:05.956 --> 12:08.057
so I disconnected her app.

12:08.058 --> 12:10.126
I mean, how many times
can she yell at me

12:10.127 --> 12:12.494
to wash my hands after
going to the bathroom?

12:16.799 --> 12:18.634
Every time?

12:18.635 --> 12:21.170
That doll is driving me crazy.

12:21.171 --> 12:23.172
Plus, I think I'm...

12:23.173 --> 12:26.609
starting to have feelings for it.

12:26.610 --> 12:27.610
Fine.

12:27.611 --> 12:29.745
I'll take her.

12:29.746 --> 12:31.280
I haven't had a possessed doll

12:31.281 --> 12:34.083
since Chucky moved out in '09.

12:34.084 --> 12:36.085
Now, he could make a Bloody Mary.

12:36.086 --> 12:38.186
And a bloody Denise and a bloody Julio.

12:42.425 --> 12:45.428
Speaking of creepy dolls come to life.

12:45.429 --> 12:48.531
Han, if you have open
sores, you have to go home.

12:48.532 --> 12:50.867
Not that it's stopped
anyone else who works here.

12:50.868 --> 12:52.835
I can't go home.

12:52.836 --> 12:55.438
I took an oatmeal bath
to get rid of the itching,

12:55.439 --> 12:57.440
and it flooded my apartment.

12:57.441 --> 12:59.041
I tried eating it down,

12:59.042 --> 13:01.878
but I passed out and nearly suffocated.

13:01.879 --> 13:05.548
Well, find a nice subway
bench to curl up on.

13:05.549 --> 13:07.450
Or even a Subway sandwich.

13:07.451 --> 13:09.674
You know how embarrassing it
would be to catch a disease

13:09.675 --> 13:13.356
from a guy I haven't slept with?

13:14.858 --> 13:16.959
What? Do I have something in my teeth?

13:16.960 --> 13:19.362
Yes, of course. But not that.

13:19.363 --> 13:23.032
Max, I think you have chicken pox.

13:23.033 --> 13:26.302
Well, I could make this
less embarrassing for you.

13:26.303 --> 13:28.336
We could have sex.

13:32.842 --> 13:34.544
Ugh.

13:34.545 --> 13:36.479
I can't believe that
little Outbreak monkey

13:36.480 --> 13:39.182
gave me the pox!

13:39.183 --> 13:41.050
If I get my mittens on
him, I'm gonna tear him

13:41.051 --> 13:43.252
from tiny limb to tiny limb.

13:43.253 --> 13:46.389
Best I stay in the bathroom then?

13:46.390 --> 13:48.157
No.

13:48.158 --> 13:51.494
Come on out, patient-zero-friends.

13:51.495 --> 13:53.596
I need you to enter
your Netflix password.

13:53.597 --> 13:57.433
It's "Han job 69."
You're the one who set it.

13:57.434 --> 14:00.036
And thanks for letting me crash here.

14:00.037 --> 14:03.105
I'm not sure you can legally
make me your butler for life,

14:03.106 --> 14:05.908
but I did sign the contract.

14:05.909 --> 14:09.178
I'm still feeling a little woozy.

14:09.179 --> 14:10.680
Hello, Sophie.

14:10.681 --> 14:12.715
Don't change the subject.

14:12.716 --> 14:15.117
For the first time, I really
wanted to go to school.

14:15.118 --> 14:17.353
I know I could fit
your head in my toilet,

14:17.354 --> 14:19.377
but I wonder if I can get
your whole body in there.

14:19.378 --> 14:23.292
Wow, you really put
the "bitch" in "itch."

14:23.293 --> 14:25.695
Could you?

14:25.696 --> 14:28.097
Ah, that's the stuff.

14:28.098 --> 14:30.533
Now get my back.

14:30.534 --> 14:33.069
You like that? Is it hard enough?

14:33.070 --> 14:34.270
Am I hurting you?

14:34.271 --> 14:36.239
Don't flatter yourself.

14:36.240 --> 14:38.040
Don't stop till I get enough.

14:38.041 --> 14:41.076
Won't that be easier if
Max takes her shirt off?

14:42.211 --> 14:43.379
Oleg!

14:43.380 --> 14:45.281
Are you spying on us?

14:45.282 --> 14:48.217
Momma.

14:48.218 --> 14:49.552
I am so screwed.

14:49.553 --> 14:51.754
The bartending test is in two hours,

14:51.755 --> 14:53.789
and I can't remember
what goes in a White Lady.

14:53.790 --> 14:57.727
A bottle of chardonnay and then
a fat guy that makes her laugh.

14:57.728 --> 14:59.328
Is that Caroline?

14:59.329 --> 15:01.596
She sounds like she's
not wearing underwear.

15:04.400 --> 15:07.069
How did Oleg get inside the doll?

15:07.070 --> 15:10.573
Wish it was the first time I said that.

15:10.574 --> 15:11.807
I got the app,

15:11.808 --> 15:14.143
and now I have a Saturday night.

15:14.144 --> 15:17.179
Oleg, have you seen my Sophie doll?

15:17.180 --> 15:19.148
Uh... I haven't seen her.

15:19.149 --> 15:20.616
Gotta go.

15:20.617 --> 15:24.320
Wait, this thing works with any phone?

15:24.321 --> 15:26.455
Oh, my God, Max, we can use the doll so

15:26.456 --> 15:28.924
you can read me the ingredients
for drinks on the test.

15:28.925 --> 15:31.661
You mean cheat? At school?

15:31.662 --> 15:33.329
Wow, maybe we did switch bodies.

15:33.330 --> 15:36.666
- Rats.
- Oh, thank God.

15:36.667 --> 15:38.334
Is there any way I
could get either of you

15:38.335 --> 15:40.603
to scratch my tum-tum?

15:40.604 --> 15:43.306
Here.

15:43.307 --> 15:44.307
Ooh.

15:44.308 --> 15:46.674
The nails are real.

15:48.087 --> 15:48.710
Ooh.

15:50.000 --> 15:56.074

15:58.484 --> 16:00.218
Nice shirt, nerd.

16:00.674 --> 16:03.109
Ooh, nice shirt.

16:03.110 --> 16:04.342
Thanks, Mr. B.

16:05.478 --> 16:07.079
Any love for my shirt?

16:07.080 --> 16:08.414
Mm, feels desperate.

16:08.415 --> 16:10.483
Hey, where's Max?

16:10.484 --> 16:12.585
A bunch of us are going
to Chili's after class.

16:12.586 --> 16:14.687
Max is sick, but I'm totally free.

16:14.688 --> 16:17.523
Mm, reservation's only for ten.

16:17.524 --> 16:19.759
But Max isn't here,
so I can take her spot.

16:19.760 --> 16:21.126
You'd think.

16:23.095 --> 16:24.363
What's that?

16:24.364 --> 16:26.799
Oh, this is my emotional support doll.

16:26.800 --> 16:28.933
I brush her hair and it calms me down.

16:28.934 --> 16:30.535
I'm not insane.

16:30.536 --> 16:32.804
Hey, I've been saying that for 30 years!

16:32.805 --> 16:34.639
All right, kiddies,

16:34.640 --> 16:37.008
I need ten drinks in ten minutes.

16:37.009 --> 16:39.244
Or, as a blacked-out me once said,

16:39.245 --> 16:41.713
"Let's get this starty parted."

16:41.714 --> 16:42.681
Begin.

16:42.682 --> 16:44.549
Max, are you there?

16:44.550 --> 16:45.917
Can you see the set-up?

16:45.918 --> 16:47.886
I see you and Julie both

16:47.887 --> 16:51.189
shop at Tommy Bah-Brown Nose.

16:51.190 --> 16:53.224
Care for a cinnamon stick in your cocoa?

16:53.225 --> 16:56.695
Never mind, a millipede carried it off.

16:56.696 --> 16:58.797
How's school? Did anybody ask about me?

16:58.798 --> 17:00.565
Tell Keith whassup.

17:00.566 --> 17:02.567
And tell Dave whassup,
but not in front of Keith.

17:02.568 --> 17:04.202
Max, focus.

17:04.203 --> 17:06.471
The first drink I have
to make is a Negroni.

17:06.472 --> 17:08.406
And I'll tell you how to make it

17:08.406 --> 17:10.342
as soon as you relay a message to Jeff

17:10.343 --> 17:12.143
that goes a lot like this:

17:12.144 --> 17:13.611
whassup.

17:14.747 --> 17:17.281
Max says, "Whassup, whassup."

17:17.282 --> 17:19.084
Okay, I'm listening.

17:19.085 --> 17:20.617
Gin.

17:20.618 --> 17:22.252
No, that's not gin.

17:22.253 --> 17:24.356
Did you even go to kindergarten?

17:24.357 --> 17:26.558
It's the one right next to it.

17:26.559 --> 17:27.759
Got it.

17:27.760 --> 17:30.161
Wow, I am really cheating.

17:30.162 --> 17:33.298
I am such a bad girl.

17:33.299 --> 17:36.000
Here we go, hot cocoa Han-style.

17:36.001 --> 17:38.470
Complete with a frothy
marshmallow layer.

17:38.471 --> 17:40.505
Ooh, marshmallows.

17:40.506 --> 17:42.574
And marshmallows, got it.

17:42.575 --> 17:43.842
No, no, no, not you.

17:43.843 --> 17:45.944
I was talking to Swiss Miss over here.

17:47.179 --> 17:48.813
Aah...

17:48.814 --> 17:51.850
choo.

17:51.851 --> 17:54.185
Man, you are acting crazier than me

17:54.186 --> 17:56.388
when I was stalking Tom Hanks.

17:56.389 --> 17:57.789
It's okay, it's okay.

17:57.790 --> 17:59.824
You spilled all over the book.

17:59.825 --> 18:02.127
I can't read a thing. How is this okay?

18:02.128 --> 18:03.361
Because...

18:03.362 --> 18:05.295
that was your cocoa.

18:07.832 --> 18:09.601
Mmm.

18:09.602 --> 18:12.871
How do you like your
girl Swiss Miss now?

18:12.872 --> 18:15.340
You better grab something
to dry this book off.

18:15.341 --> 18:17.776
Bookoff? Is that a vodka?

18:17.777 --> 18:19.544
I'm panicking. I'm gonna fail.

18:19.545 --> 18:21.212
Aah!

18:25.216 --> 18:26.651
Aw,

18:26.652 --> 18:28.392
cheating on a bartending test?

18:28.393 --> 18:31.494
I am gonna tell you the same
thing I told The Situation:

18:31.495 --> 18:34.197
you take it on back to Jersey.

18:34.198 --> 18:35.999
Good one, Mr. B.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.336
Oh, thanks, Julie.

18:38.337 --> 18:40.705
I am so sorry, Mr. Bronski.

18:40.706 --> 18:42.639
Please don't fail me. I'll do anything.

18:42.640 --> 18:44.342
- Oh.
- But nothing sexual.

18:44.343 --> 18:45.842
Oh.

18:45.843 --> 18:48.043
I mean, after all, it's
just bartending school.

18:49.746 --> 18:51.549
I'm gonna take this doll with me.

18:51.550 --> 18:53.684
She's gonna be our tenth at Chili's.

18:55.687 --> 18:57.154
Hey, Mr. B, whassup!

18:57.155 --> 18:58.755
Hi, Max.

19:01.058 --> 19:03.060
I just can't get it out of my head.

19:03.061 --> 19:04.595
It was terrible.

19:04.596 --> 19:06.831
He ripped apart the doll
right in front of me.

19:06.832 --> 19:08.833
And then this part I
couldn't even tell you,

19:08.834 --> 19:11.102
I f...

19:11.103 --> 19:12.936
- Failed?
- Farted!

19:14.572 --> 19:17.074
You know how my stomach
gets when I'm upset.

19:17.075 --> 19:19.343
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

19:19.344 --> 19:21.512
I woke up with me and Han spooning.

19:23.582 --> 19:25.116
Which spoon were you?

19:25.117 --> 19:28.451
The one with the stiffie
in her back for three hours.

19:30.554 --> 19:32.489
Hey, everybody.

19:35.059 --> 19:37.561
We just stopped in for
a Jolly Rancher shot

19:37.562 --> 19:38.962
on our way to a live sex show.

19:41.065 --> 19:42.233
Sophie, where's the baby?

19:42.234 --> 19:44.402
Oh, she's with the babysitter.

19:44.403 --> 19:48.304
Some perverted SOB stole my Sophie doll.

19:49.707 --> 19:51.642
I realized that

19:51.643 --> 19:53.611
it's okay not to watch baby Barbara

19:53.612 --> 19:55.378
for 24-8.

19:56.914 --> 20:00.084
You know, in Poland,
we get the extra day.

20:00.085 --> 20:02.385
For dredging the lakes.

20:04.722 --> 20:06.624
Why don't you go get us a table, Sophie?

20:06.625 --> 20:09.260
Okay.

20:09.261 --> 20:11.195
Any chance of getting that doll back?

20:11.196 --> 20:14.498
I really underestimated how
strong my feelings for it were.

20:14.499 --> 20:16.467
I know.

20:16.468 --> 20:19.670
I was the one who walked
in on you brushing her hair.

20:19.671 --> 20:22.973
And I was the one who asked
you not to repeat that.

20:22.974 --> 20:24.675
I'll have a mojito.

20:24.676 --> 20:26.310
Sorry, we don't do off-menu drinks.

20:26.311 --> 20:27.278
I'm on it.

20:27.279 --> 20:28.779
Bup-bup-bup!

20:28.780 --> 20:29.979
One mojito coming up.

20:31.449 --> 20:33.551
What are you doing? We failed the class.

20:33.552 --> 20:36.620
Ooh, first time I
didn't fart saying that.

20:36.621 --> 20:37.955
You failed.

20:37.956 --> 20:39.590
Between studying and helping you cheat,

20:39.591 --> 20:41.692
I learned how to make
every drink in that book.

20:41.693 --> 20:45.296
Oh, my God, Max, you learned something.

20:45.297 --> 20:47.431
I failed so you could succeed.

20:47.432 --> 20:49.767
So in a way, I succeeded too.

20:49.768 --> 20:52.737
You've done it again, Caroline Channing.

20:52.738 --> 20:55.004
Oh, yeah!

20:58.175 --> 21:00.577
Oh. The live sex show is here.
