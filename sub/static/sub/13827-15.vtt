00:16.517 --> 00:19.019
The moment of reckoning is at hand!

00:20.187 --> 00:24.900
I have but one question for you...
what do you think this means?

00:24.983 --> 00:28.111
"The vile Lord Dominator
demands the presence of Lord Hater...

Okay look, I'm the greatest in the galaxy.

00:43.836 --> 00:45.671
Dominator's probably
already in love with me,

00:45.754 --> 00:48.757

even more perfect than usual.

00:49.258 --> 00:52.970

lovey-dovey junk.

00:53.387 --> 00:57.391

help me out or whatever.
