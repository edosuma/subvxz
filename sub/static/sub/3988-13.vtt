- Yeah, I got it.

03:10.024 --> 03:11.730
Hi.

03:11.901 --> 03:13.687
Hello.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.601
Daryl:
Just you out here?

03:16.614 --> 03:18.104
Yeah.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.615
How long's it been
like that for?

03:21.786 --> 03:24.493
I don't know.

03:25.915 --> 03:30.033
l was with one group
and another one after that.

03:30.211 --> 03:33.248
They didn't make it?
Neither one of them?

03:37.676 --> 03:39.712
What's your name?

03:39.887 --> 03:42.879
Bob Stookey.

03:45.476 --> 03:46.966
You people have a camp?

03:50.314 --> 03:52.225
How many walkers
have you killed?

03:53.692 --> 03:56.900
Haven't kept count.
A couple dozen.

03:57.071 --> 03:59.187
How many people
you kill?

04:01.075 --> 04:02.565
Only one.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.413
Why?

04:07.790 --> 04:09.781
She asked me to.

04:13.421 --> 04:15.207
Want to come with us?

04:20.219 --> 04:22.005
Yes.

04:22.179 --> 04:24.340
You got any
questions for us?

04:24.515 --> 04:26.426
No.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.852
It doesn't matter
who you are.

04:29.019 --> 04:30.725
Really?

04:32.314 --> 04:34.646
Yeah.

04:34.817 --> 04:36.933
It doesn't matter.

04:47.121 --> 04:49.112
(theme music playing )

05:25.242 --> 05:27.733
(walkers snarling )

05:27.912 --> 05:30.369
( panting )

06:02.238 --> 06:05.605
(growling)

06:25.010 --> 06:26.625
- Bob!
-( Bob screams )

06:26.804 --> 06:29.341
- ( gunshot)
- Maggie!

06:29.515 --> 06:31.096
Let go of her!

06:31.267 --> 06:33.258
No! No!

06:36.772 --> 06:39.605
( roaring )

06:39.775 --> 06:41.436
(gunshot)

06:46.824 --> 06:48.985
( panting )

06:49.159 --> 06:50.990
Bob.

06:51.161 --> 06:53.243
It's okay.

06:53.414 --> 06:55.746
He got me
right on the bandage.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.328
(laughing)

06:58.502 --> 07:01.164
Ow.
Ow! Ow! Ow!

07:02.631 --> 07:04.167
I didn't say stop.

07:04.341 --> 07:07.174
ljust said ow.
( laughs )

07:07.344 --> 07:09.756
ljust said ow.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.841
( laughs)

07:12.016 --> 07:14.803
- Are we close?
- Almost done.

07:14.977 --> 07:16.638
How do you know?

07:16.812 --> 07:18.313
The signs are all there.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.345
Just got to know
how to read 'em.

07:22.985 --> 07:24.350
What are we tracking?

07:24.528 --> 07:26.940
You tell me.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.105
You're the one
who wanted to learn.

07:31.744 --> 07:34.861
Well, something
came through here.

07:35.039 --> 07:37.155
The pattern
is all zig-zaggy.

07:37.333 --> 07:40.200
It's a walker.

07:40.377 --> 07:42.368
Maybe it's a drunk.

07:43.547 --> 07:45.833
I'm getting good at this.

07:46.008 --> 07:48.090
Pretty soon I won't
need you at all.

07:48.260 --> 07:51.252
Yeah, keep on tracking.

07:52.431 --> 07:55.218
(snarling )

07:55.392 --> 07:57.178
It's got a gun.

08:15.913 --> 08:18.370
- ( snaps )
- ( gasps )

08:18.540 --> 08:20.201
(snarling )

08:32.846 --> 08:35.223
Can you move it?

08:37.726 --> 08:39.227
Yeah.

08:41.563 --> 08:42.769
You ready?

08:44.608 --> 08:45.848
We should wait
till the fog clears.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.186
We've been waiting
a while.

08:47.361 --> 08:50.353
You see all this?
We got lucky.

08:50.531 --> 08:52.442
We need visibility.

08:52.616 --> 08:54.117
We've got
six bullets left.

08:54.284 --> 08:55.694
She's right.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.279
We've been doing good
following the plan.

09:05.337 --> 09:06.998
What is it?

09:08.882 --> 09:11.134
lt's broken.

09:13.178 --> 09:14.714
We don't need it.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.049
Sun comes up in the east,
sets in the west.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.886
We'll keep an eye
on it in between.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.301
We'll be fine.

09:33.657 --> 09:35.818
Can we--
can we hold up a sec?

09:35.993 --> 09:37.358
You all right?

09:37.536 --> 09:39.868
ljust need
to sit down.

09:42.458 --> 09:45.416
All right.
Hold up.

09:46.420 --> 09:48.001
( exhales )

09:49.506 --> 09:51.337
Hop on.

09:51.508 --> 09:53.373
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

09:53.552 --> 09:55.918
This is a serious piggyback.
Jump up.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.469
You're heavier
than you look.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.552
Maybe there are
people there.

10:05.731 --> 10:09.098
Yeah, if there are,
l'll handle them.

10:10.444 --> 10:12.605
There are still
good people, Daryl.

10:12.780 --> 10:15.442
I don't think
the good ones survive.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.664
What's that?

11:23.183 --> 11:25.344
Terminus.

11:25.519 --> 11:27.805
When we were out on the run
to the veterinary college,

11:27.980 --> 11:29.766
we heard a message
about this on the radio.

11:29.940 --> 11:32.431
- They were broadcasting?
- What did it say?

11:32.609 --> 11:34.019
Couldn't make it out.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.105
| only know because
I'm seeing it now.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.441
"Those who arrive survive."

11:40.784 --> 11:42.615
We should go.

11:42.786 --> 11:44.367
I thought we were
looking for Glenn.

11:44.538 --> 11:45.869
If he saw one of these,

11:46.039 --> 11:47.870
he would go looking for me
looking for him.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.702
Look at this map.
All these tracks

11:49.877 --> 11:51.458
from different directions
leading to the same place.

11:51.628 --> 11:53.289
It's far.

11:53.463 --> 11:55.044
And we don't know
if there are other signs.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.716
You don't think
this is the only one.

11:56.884 --> 11:59.500
This is the best lead
we've had so far.

11:59.678 --> 12:02.294
It says sanctuary.
That's just another reason to try.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.633
Others from the prison
could be there. Tyreese.

12:04.808 --> 12:06.799
If it sounds too good
to be true...

12:06.977 --> 12:10.140
Maybe if Glenn saw one of these,
maybe he felt the same way.

12:10.314 --> 12:13.397
He wouldn't.
He'd believe, I know.

12:13.567 --> 12:15.728
What do you want
to do, Sasha?

12:15.903 --> 12:18.360
Keep making these
circles from the bus?

12:18.530 --> 12:20.862
Or are you talking about us
starting to do something else?

12:22.826 --> 12:24.987
We're not splitting up.

12:25.162 --> 12:27.244
That can't happen.

12:28.874 --> 12:30.660
You want to take
a vote or something?

12:35.339 --> 12:37.876
We don't need to vote.

13:01.907 --> 13:03.898
( bangs)

13:04.076 --> 13:05.691
( whistles )

13:05.869 --> 13:07.860
Give it a minute.

13:17.798 --> 13:19.959
It's so clean.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.634
Yeah.

13:21.802 --> 13:24.293
Someone's been
tending to it.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.632
May still be around.

14:03.677 --> 14:06.259
( clears throat )

14:06.430 --> 14:09.012
Let's get
that ankle wrapped.

14:14.855 --> 14:17.517
Looks like somebody
ran out of dolls to dress up.

14:17.691 --> 14:19.272
It's beautiful.

14:20.819 --> 14:23.401
Whoever did this cared.

14:25.198 --> 14:28.190
They wanted these people
to get a funeral.

14:28.368 --> 14:31.030
They remembered
these things were people

14:31.204 --> 14:33.661
before all this.

14:33.832 --> 14:36.323
They didn't let it
change them in the end.

14:36.501 --> 14:39.038
Don't you think
that's beautiful?

14:44.676 --> 14:46.667
Come on.

14:48.305 --> 14:49.966
( clears throat )

14:59.149 --> 15:01.856
- Where's Maggie?
- Getting more firewood.

15:03.904 --> 15:05.986
Still bleeding?

15:07.407 --> 15:09.238
Barely.

15:11.244 --> 15:14.577
- So tell me...
- Tell you what?

15:14.748 --> 15:17.660
You think we should stop.

15:21.004 --> 15:22.505
Yeah.

15:23.799 --> 15:25.755
Tell me why.

15:25.926 --> 15:27.712
To not die.

15:29.096 --> 15:31.758
You, Maggie, me.

15:31.932 --> 15:34.674
- Yeah, that's not it.
- What?

15:34.851 --> 15:37.558
I don't think you know
why you want to stop.

15:37.729 --> 15:40.015
Bob, what happened
this morning,

15:40.190 --> 15:41.771
we get warnings.

15:41.942 --> 15:43.773
We did fine.

15:43.944 --> 15:45.775
We get warnings.

15:47.322 --> 15:49.779
And the next time
it's on us.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.777
Odds are Glenn is dead.

15:57.541 --> 16:00.123
Odds are we will be, too.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.955
That's the reality.

16:03.130 --> 16:06.042
We got six bullets
and you're still bleeding.

16:11.179 --> 16:14.592
Those tracks,
they run through towns.

16:14.766 --> 16:17.849
The first one we see,
we find a building,

16:18.019 --> 16:19.555
some higher ground
to set up in.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.720
All of us.

16:21.898 --> 16:23.638
That's what
we need to do.

16:25.694 --> 16:27.309
That's what
we're gonna do.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.569
If we can talk her
into it.

16:38.832 --> 16:40.823
Just think about it.

16:46.923 --> 16:48.254
Dang.

16:49.259 --> 16:50.669
You find anything?

16:53.013 --> 16:55.504
Whoa.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.138
Peanut butter and jelly,

16:57.309 --> 16:59.846
diet soda,
and pig's feet.

17:00.020 --> 17:02.557
That's a white trash
brunch right there.

17:02.731 --> 17:05.188
It all looks
good to me.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.440
No, hold up.

17:07.611 --> 17:09.852
Ain't a speck of dust
on this.

17:11.198 --> 17:12.529
So?

17:12.699 --> 17:15.190
That means somebody
just put it here.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.108
This is someone's stash.

17:17.287 --> 17:19.699
Maybe they're still alive.

17:19.873 --> 17:23.286
All right, we'll take some of it
and we'll leave the rest, all right?

17:23.460 --> 17:25.291
I knew it.

17:25.462 --> 17:26.872
Knew what?

17:27.047 --> 17:28.503
It's like I said.

17:28.673 --> 17:30.789
There are still
good people.

17:32.302 --> 17:34.964
- Mm.
- Gross.

17:36.723 --> 17:40.056
Hey, those pig's feet
are mine.

17:41.686 --> 17:43.972
( rattling )

17:48.568 --> 17:52.481
J‘ Pine for summer J‘

17:52.656 --> 17:55.898
J‘ And we'll buy J‘

17:56.076 --> 17:59.113
J‘ A beer to shotgun J‘

17:59.287 --> 18:02.745
J‘ We'll lay on our lawn J‘

18:02.916 --> 18:05.578
J‘ And we'll be good... J‘

18:09.089 --> 18:11.080
( clears throat )

18:11.258 --> 18:13.590
The place
is nailed up tight.

18:18.974 --> 18:21.010
The only way in
is through the front door.

18:25.897 --> 18:27.603
What are you doing?

18:27.774 --> 18:30.937
This is the comfiest bed
I've had in years.

18:31.111 --> 18:34.194
- Really?
- I ain't kidding.

18:34.364 --> 18:35.900
(sighs)

18:37.701 --> 18:41.319
Why don't you go ahead
and play some more?

18:41.496 --> 18:43.612
Keep singing.

18:43.790 --> 18:46.156
I thought my singing
annoyed you.

18:46.334 --> 18:48.871
There ain't
no jukebox, so...

18:55.135 --> 18:58.377
- J‘ And we'll buy... J‘
-( playing piano)

18:58.555 --> 19:01.547
J‘ A beer to shotgun J‘

19:01.725 --> 19:04.808
J‘ We'll lay on the lawn J‘

19:04.978 --> 19:08.220
J‘ And we'll be good J‘

19:09.899 --> 19:13.391
J‘ Now I'm laughing
at my boredom J‘

19:13.570 --> 19:16.778
J‘ And my string
of failed attempts... J‘

19:28.376 --> 19:30.708
Bob?

19:48.980 --> 19:51.016
Bob.

19:54.402 --> 19:56.859
Come on.
She's got to follow the tracks.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.941
We can still
catch up to her.

20:03.870 --> 20:07.533
Sasha, we can still
catch up to her.

20:37.320 --> 20:38.821
( knife clicks )

20:40.240 --> 20:42.481
(snarling )

21:15.775 --> 21:17.436
( scoffs )

21:17.610 --> 21:20.522
You have been grinning
since we left the prison in one piece.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.112
If you're so happy
to be alive,

21:23.283 --> 21:25.899
then why are we walking
into the heart of darkness?

21:26.077 --> 21:28.284
It's not about
me being alive.

21:30.039 --> 21:31.575
( scoffs )

21:31.749 --> 21:33.910
Do you even know
why you're smiling?

21:34.085 --> 21:35.871
Oh, yeah.

21:40.133 --> 21:43.091
I'm not alone.

21:43.261 --> 21:46.674
That's how it happened
when I lost my first group.

21:46.848 --> 21:48.964
And my second group.

21:49.142 --> 21:51.098
I broke that streak.

21:51.269 --> 21:53.510
You'd be smiling, too.

21:53.688 --> 21:55.644
Self-awareness
is a beautiful thing.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.521
You should
try it sometime.

22:00.236 --> 22:03.023
- You're not going to take the bait?
- Nope.

22:03.198 --> 22:05.610
You're just as bullheaded
as she is sometimes.

22:05.783 --> 22:07.398
You know that?

22:25.595 --> 22:28.302
Yeah.

22:28.473 --> 22:29.713
Beth:
Going as fast as I can.

22:29.891 --> 22:31.347
Daryl:
Forget that.

22:31.518 --> 22:33.634
( Beth laughs)

22:36.523 --> 22:38.229
Here you go.

22:40.276 --> 22:42.187
Whew.

22:42.362 --> 22:45.149
All right.
Let's eat.

22:46.991 --> 22:49.573
( cans rattle )

22:51.579 --> 22:53.490
Stay.

23:02.465 --> 23:04.046
( panting )

23:04.217 --> 23:06.208
It's just a damn dog.

23:06.386 --> 23:08.126
Hi.

23:08.304 --> 23:11.046
- Come here, boy.
- ( yeIPS)

23:18.898 --> 23:20.229
He wouldn't come in?

23:20.400 --> 23:22.061
I told you to stay back.

23:22.235 --> 23:25.648
Yeah, but, Daryl,
you said there was a dog.

23:27.031 --> 23:29.067
Maybe he'll come
back around. Come on.

23:29.242 --> 23:32.234
(walker snarling )

23:44.757 --> 23:46.873
I'm awake.

23:47.051 --> 23:49.303
So am |.

23:51.681 --> 23:53.763
Can you see it?

23:53.933 --> 23:55.924
No.

23:56.102 --> 23:57.433
Been that way
for an hour.

23:57.604 --> 23:59.469
Might be stuck
on something.

23:59.647 --> 24:01.763
(snarling continues)

24:01.941 --> 24:04.557
There's a lot
of noise at night.

24:04.736 --> 24:07.569
Cicadas, owls.

24:07.739 --> 24:10.526
I think sometimes
they go in circles.

24:12.118 --> 24:13.824
Still, when lwas
out here by myself,

24:13.995 --> 24:15.701
I didn't sleep much.

24:15.872 --> 24:18.113
You're not sleeping
much now.

24:18.291 --> 24:20.748
You've got to heal.
You need to sleep.

24:23.046 --> 24:25.253
I can try.

24:25.423 --> 24:27.755
(snarling continues)

24:40.021 --> 24:42.262
I tried.

24:48.488 --> 24:50.979
Bob, what the hell
are we doing out here?

24:55.370 --> 24:57.782
Why do you think
Tyreese is dead?

25:02.418 --> 25:03.498
What?

25:03.670 --> 25:06.161
lf Tyreese were alive,
he'd go for Terminus.

25:06.339 --> 25:08.330
I know you know that.

25:08.508 --> 25:11.250
So why do you think
he's dead?

25:11.427 --> 25:14.760
Or are you just too afraid
to find out if he is or not?

25:19.519 --> 25:21.726
Hmm.

25:21.896 --> 25:25.184
Up until now, I thought you were
the toughest person I ever met.

25:26.526 --> 25:27.891
Which is kind of weird,

25:28.069 --> 25:31.106
'cause you were
the sweetest, too.

25:31.280 --> 25:33.271
Just saying.

25:38.788 --> 25:40.619
(sighs)

25:40.790 --> 25:43.782
(snarling continues)

25:51.217 --> 25:53.583
I'm gonna leave
a thank-you note.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.554
Why?

25:58.725 --> 26:01.011
For when they come back.

26:01.185 --> 26:04.302
If they come back.

26:04.480 --> 26:07.267
Even if they're not coming back,
I still want to say thanks.

26:11.487 --> 26:13.944
Maybe you don't
have to leave that.

26:16.075 --> 26:18.566
Maybe we stick around
here for a while.

26:20.747 --> 26:22.783
They come back,

26:22.957 --> 26:25.414
we'll just make it work.

26:25.585 --> 26:27.541
They may be nuts,

26:27.712 --> 26:31.079
but maybe
it'll be all right.

26:33.760 --> 26:37.093
So you do think there are still
good people around.

26:39.265 --> 26:41.472
( chuckles)
What changed your mind?

26:47.148 --> 26:49.104
You know.

26:50.109 --> 26:51.349
What?

26:59.118 --> 27:00.449
( mumbles)
I don't know.

27:00.620 --> 27:03.157
Don't... ( mumbles)

27:03.331 --> 27:05.367
What changed your mind?

27:13.090 --> 27:14.921
Oh.

27:16.344 --> 27:19.677
- ( cans rattle )
- ( dog barks, whines)

27:21.307 --> 27:24.470
I'm gonna give that mutt
one more chance.

27:26.979 --> 27:28.515
(snarling )

27:28.689 --> 27:30.975
Beth! Beth!

27:34.612 --> 27:36.398
Run!

27:36.572 --> 27:38.403
Run!

27:41.327 --> 27:44.660
Beth, pry open a window.
Get your shit.

27:45.790 --> 27:48.031
Beth:
I'm not gonna leave you.

27:48.209 --> 27:50.575
Go out. Go up the road.
I'll meet you there.

27:52.338 --> 27:53.919
Go!

27:55.883 --> 27:57.999
This way.

29:08.915 --> 29:10.746
(tires squealing )

29:12.418 --> 29:15.581
Beth! Beth!

29:17.632 --> 29:19.497
Beth!

29:36.692 --> 29:38.944
She's keeping to the tracks.

29:39.111 --> 29:41.318
If we pick up the pace,
we'll catch her.

29:41.489 --> 29:43.275
(sighs)

29:58.297 --> 30:01.289
( breathing heavily )

30:17.233 --> 30:20.225
( panting )

30:59.025 --> 31:02.188
Bob, right there.

31:04.196 --> 31:06.733
Secure and high up.

31:06.907 --> 31:09.944
See if we can set up something
to catch the rain.

31:10.119 --> 31:13.236
See if we could move
from the rooftops to look for food.

31:13.414 --> 31:14.995
Maybe even try to grow
some up there.

31:15.166 --> 31:17.748
Sasha,
I'm not stopping.

31:17.918 --> 31:19.658
We are.

31:19.837 --> 31:22.579
I'm not.

31:22.757 --> 31:24.873
She's out there alone.

31:27.970 --> 31:30.427
She didn't want us
to come.

31:30.598 --> 31:32.634
She made her choice
for her.

31:32.808 --> 31:34.139
I don't care.

31:34.310 --> 31:35.800
She's alone.

31:37.688 --> 31:39.929
When I got to the prison,
I thought to myself,

31:40.107 --> 31:42.723
"How long?
The clock's ticking.

31:42.902 --> 31:46.019
How long until everyone else
is dead and I'm on my own?"

31:46.197 --> 31:49.109
Bad things happened
'cause I was scared.

31:49.283 --> 31:52.696
They didn't need to.
I didn't need to be afraid.

31:52.870 --> 31:55.486
Now, we get to Terminus
and Tyreese isn't there,

31:55.664 --> 31:57.495
it doesn't mean
he's dead.

31:57.666 --> 32:00.908
- You don't need to be afraid.
- I am not afraid.

32:12.598 --> 32:15.055
So this is it?

32:16.519 --> 32:18.384
It doesn't have to be.

32:18.562 --> 32:20.769
That's right.

32:28.614 --> 32:30.775
I'm gonna try
something here.

32:55.558 --> 32:57.298
Well, okay.

32:58.936 --> 33:00.551
You don't have to do it.

33:02.815 --> 33:05.477
You don't have
to be alone again.

33:12.575 --> 33:14.531
I won't be.

34:01.415 --> 34:03.576
( stairs creaking )

34:46.627 --> 34:49.243
( breath hitching )

35:42.808 --> 35:44.139
Maggie?

35:45.811 --> 35:48.177
(snarling )

35:48.355 --> 35:50.516
Oh, shit.

36:31.857 --> 36:34.519
( breathing heavily )

36:38.238 --> 36:39.978
Where's Bob?

36:40.157 --> 36:42.193
Out looking for you.

36:42.368 --> 36:45.280
Why are you here?

36:45.454 --> 36:48.196
l was looking
for another walker.

36:48.374 --> 36:50.535
Found more than lwanted.

36:52.878 --> 36:54.834
You know,
I was lying there

36:55.005 --> 36:56.745
and I remembered--

36:56.924 --> 36:59.540
I heard what you said
back at the camp.

37:01.428 --> 37:03.885
I heard you say
you thought we should

37:04.056 --> 37:06.342
be in a town.

37:08.685 --> 37:12.018
What else did you
hear me say?

37:12.189 --> 37:15.147
That odds are
Glenn is dead.

37:18.070 --> 37:20.061
And we should stop.

37:25.702 --> 37:28.114
But you're wrong.

37:32.626 --> 37:35.083
So why are you here?

37:40.175 --> 37:42.166
'Cause l was waiting
for you.

37:44.930 --> 37:47.091
I'm not giving up.

37:48.767 --> 37:51.099
But I need your help.

37:51.270 --> 37:54.228
'Cause I can't
do it by myself.

37:55.774 --> 37:58.811
And even if
I catch up to Bob,

37:58.986 --> 38:01.022
we can't do it alone.

38:03.949 --> 38:07.441
I thought that I couldn't
ask you to risk your life.

38:09.204 --> 38:11.991
But I can.

38:12.166 --> 38:14.623
'Cause I know what
you'd be risking it for.

38:17.796 --> 38:19.912
And it isn'tjust Glenn.

38:22.259 --> 38:23.795
| get that
you're afraid.

38:23.969 --> 38:25.960
lam.

38:27.306 --> 38:29.217
I am afraid.

38:30.309 --> 38:31.640
We could get there.

38:31.810 --> 38:33.596
I know.

38:39.985 --> 38:41.976
So let's go get Bob...

38:45.324 --> 38:46.689
and let's get there.

39:02.799 --> 39:05.006
Well, lookit here.

39:14.603 --> 39:15.763
(grunts)

39:15.938 --> 39:17.348
(guns cocking)

39:17.523 --> 39:19.013
Damn it, hold up!

39:19.191 --> 39:21.523
l'm claiming the vest.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.524
I like them wings.

39:23.695 --> 39:25.811
Hold up.

39:27.366 --> 39:30.028
(laughing)

39:41.046 --> 39:42.877
A bowman.

39:44.049 --> 39:45.585
I respect that.

39:45.759 --> 39:47.124
See, a man with a rifle,

39:47.302 --> 39:49.167
he could have been some
kind of photographer

39:49.346 --> 39:51.007
orsoccercoach
back in the day.

39:51.181 --> 39:55.094
But a bowman's a bowman
through and through.

39:55.269 --> 39:57.385
What you got there,
150-pound draw weight?

39:57.563 --> 40:01.897
I'll be donkey-licked if that don't fire
at least 300 feet per second.

40:03.485 --> 40:05.396
I've been looking
for a weapon like that.

40:05.571 --> 40:08.529
Of course, I'd want one
with a bit more ammo

40:08.699 --> 40:11.532
and minus
the oblongata stains.

40:11.702 --> 40:14.159
( laughs)

40:14.329 --> 40:17.321
Get yourself in some
trouble, partner?

40:17.499 --> 40:20.241
You pull that trigger,

40:20.419 --> 40:22.910
these boys are gonna
drop you several times over.

40:23.088 --> 40:25.124
That what you want?

40:25.299 --> 40:28.757
Come on, fella,
suicide is stupid.

40:28.927 --> 40:31.669
Why hurt yourself
when you can hurt other people?

40:38.645 --> 40:40.852
Name's Joe.

40:43.984 --> 40:46.225
Daryl.

40:47.279 --> 40:50.612
(music playing )

41:00.167 --> 41:05.127
J‘ No more time J‘

41:06.798 --> 41:11.417
J‘ For crying tears... J‘

41:18.268 --> 41:19.804
Maggie:
Bob.

41:40.082 --> 41:42.664
J‘ Oh... J‘

41:53.136 --> 41:55.969
J‘ Oh... J‘

42:06.024 --> 42:10.859
J‘ Ooh ooh ooh J‘

42:12.823 --> 42:17.362
J‘ Ooh ooh ooh J‘

42:19.538 --> 42:23.872
J‘OhohohJ‘

42:25.711 --> 42:29.954
J‘ Ooh ooh ooh. J‘

42:32.926 --> 42:32.960
(theme music playing )

42:32.968 --> 42:35.459
(theme music playing )
