<i>Santa's not the only one
coming to town.</i>

00:35.100 --> 00:37.800
<i>A nor'easter's headin' our way.
Know what that means?</i>

00:38.000 --> 00:39.600
<i>Lots and lots of snow.</i>

00:39.700 --> 00:41.900
<i>Hey, if anyone knows
what the heck it means</i>

00:41.900 --> 00:44.200
<i>to "batten the hatches, "
please give us a call.</i>

00:44.200 --> 00:47.400

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
yo.

01:05.900 --> 01:06.700
Hey.

01:07.300 --> 01:08.400
Thanks for meeting me, man.

01:08.400 --> 01:09.100
Yeah.

01:09.100 --> 01:11.600
It's been rough lately.
Yeah?

01:11.600 --> 01:14.000
Holidays--yoknow what they do?
Huh?

01:14.000 --> 01:16.100
They shine a light
on where you're at--

01:16.100 --> 01:18.600
who you're buying gifts for, 
who you're getting 'em from.

01:18.600 --> 01:21.800
Everyone makes a list, 
checks it twice, 

01:22.100 --> 01:23.900
sees what goes on...

01:24.100 --> 01:25.200
You working
the storm tonight?

01:25.200 --> 01:28.600
It's either that with my mom.
What?

01:28.600 --> 01:30.000
She don't drink
during the holidays, 

01:30.000 --> 01:32.100
not since
the christmas tree fire of '96, 

01:32.100 --> 01:33.400
oh, yeah.

01:36.000 --> 01:36.900
Be right back.

01:37.300 --> 01:39.300
Hey.
What's with the luggage?

01:39.500 --> 01:41.100
So you movin' in here, 
or what?

01:41.100 --> 01:43.500
No. Heading back to cali, 

01:43.500 --> 01:45.200
but I promised my brother
I'd bring him back home

01:45.200 --> 01:47.300
the best buffalo wings
in the east coast.

01:47.300 --> 01:48.900
You ever consider
sticking around knights ridge

01:48.900 --> 01:49.900
for the holidays?

01:49.900 --> 01:52.400
I mean, body does christmas
like the ridge.

01:52.500 --> 01:55.500
The singing, the fruitcake...
The revelry.

01:55.500 --> 01:57.800
Have you always been, 
like, christmas guy?

01:57.800 --> 02:00.000
'Cause it doesn't really jive
with the whole new york, 

02:00.000 --> 02:02.600
tortured artist, 
gray overcoat persona.

02:02.600 --> 02:04.400
Are you kidding?
I love christmas.

02:04.500 --> 02:06.700
Growing up, my mom did it
like nobody else.

02:06.700 --> 02:08.100
Everything was special--

02:08.100 --> 02:11.400
the food, the decorations, 
the presents.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.400
How old were you
when she died?

02:14.600 --> 02:16.200
Uh... 16.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.700
Yeah, actually, it wasn't long
after christmas of that year.

02:19.800 --> 02:22.100
You said that it was
an aneurysm, right?

02:22.100 --> 02:23.900
Yeah, yeah, um....

02:25.200 --> 02:27.600
She and my dad were watching
"casablanca" on the couch, 

02:27.600 --> 02:30.100
and then my dad got up
to get more nachos, 

02:30.100 --> 02:34.500
and... When he came back, 
she was gone.

02:35.100 --> 02:37.200
Wow.
No, the good news is, you know, 

02:37.200 --> 02:38.400
she never knew what hit her.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.900
And my dad always took comfort
in--in knowing that

02:41.200 --> 02:45.200
the ??????????

02:45.400 --> 02:47.400
Well, who could ask for more, 
I guess, right?

02:47.400 --> 02:48.000
Yeah.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.500
Here you go.
All set.

02:50.100 --> 02:53.200
Well, 
off to a snowless christmas.

02:53.200 --> 02:56.600
Enjoy your snowman
made of sand and tears.

02:56.600 --> 03:00.200
You know, it has snowed
on christmas in california.

03:00.200 --> 03:01.900
Right.
It has.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.900
In fact, I have a feeling
's going to this yea

03:04.900 --> 03:07.600
okay, it's a bet.
If it snows in california, 

03:07.800 --> 03:09.500
I'll give you--
a pony.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.300
A... Really?

03:11.300 --> 03:13.900
I've always wanted
a pony named ginger.

03:13.900 --> 03:17.300
Oh, okay, pony named ginger.
But if it doesn't snow--

03:17.300 --> 03:19.000
you buy me a drink
when I get back.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.300
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
H????

03:20.300 --> 03:21.500
'Cause either way, I lose.

03:21.500 --> 03:22.700
You think?

03:22.700 --> 03:25.400
I see it like if I win, 
I get a pony, 

03:25.400 --> 03:28.400
and if you win, you get
to drink with a thoroughbred.

03:29.500 --> 03:30.700
Have a good trip.

03:30.900 --> 03:31.600
Thanks.

03:31.600 --> 03:34.400
<i> 34 degrees and dropping
like dolla in the big dig.</i>

03:34.400 --> 03:38.400
<i>bundle up, people.
This storm is gonna be chilly.</i>

03:40.000 --> 03:43.600
hey, where's the baboon
dressed as santa ornament?

03:43.600 --> 03:45.100
You know caitlin likes
to hang that one herself

03:45.100 --> 03:46.500
on christmas morning.

03:48.400 --> 03:49.900
Well, at least
some things around here

03:49.900 --> 03:51.600
will be the same
for the kids.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.300
I wanted to try
and make things

03:54.300 --> 03:56.200
as seamless and painless
for them as possible.

03:56.200 --> 03:57.700
You have
an interesting definition

03:57.700 --> 04:00.400
of "seamless"
and "painless."

04:02.200 --> 04:03.200
Okay.

04:05.800 --> 04:07.000
I'll come over
christmas morning

04:07.000 --> 04:08.400
and spend it with the kids.

04:08.400 --> 04:09.800
You can take christmas eve.

04:09.800 --> 04:11.100
Can't we be civil enough
to spend

04:11.100 --> 04:13.500
all of christmas together
with the kids?

04:14.100 --> 04:15.500
I don't know.

04:24.700 --> 04:26.000
What's funny?

04:26.000 --> 04:27.600
It's... Nothing.

04:27.700 --> 04:28.900
Oh, no, tell me.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.500
Everything's crumbling
as we face

04:30.500 --> 04:32.200
our first christmas
as a broken family, 

04:32.200 --> 04:34.800
and you're smiling?

04:35.200 --> 04:36.800
It's just, you...

04:37.800 --> 04:39.800
You have gingerbread
on your lip.

04:40.600 --> 04:42.000
Let me get it.

04:45.700 --> 04:46.800
<i>well, you won't have to dream</i>

04:46.800 --> 04:48.500
<i>about a white christmas
this year.</i>

04:48.700 --> 04:50.200
<i>we've got a big one coming.</i>

04:51.100 --> 04:53.500
well, that was seamless.

04:55.200 --> 04:56.400
And painless.

04:56.400 --> 04:59.500
* It's the best time
of the year *

05:00.400 --> 05:03.900
* I don't know
if there'll be snow *

05:04.100 --> 05:06.600
* but have a cup of cheer *

05:07.400 --> 05:09.500
I don't know. Maybe I should
have gone with graham cracker.

05:09.600 --> 05:12.700
The twins love graham cracker, 
but my mom likes old school.

05:13.500 --> 05:15.000
Tell me we are
not about to relive

05:15.000 --> 05:17.800
the great chicken stock debate
of 90 minutes ago.

05:17.800 --> 05:20.800
I know. I'm crazy, 

05:21.100 --> 05:23.900
but I'm cooking
for eight people.

05:23.900 --> 05:25.400
I'm overwhelmed.

05:27.300 --> 05:29.800
At least all
my christmas presents are done.

05:30.100 --> 05:31.900
Speang of which, 
I meant to ask you--

05:31.900 --> 05:34.600
what did you get eddie?
What did I get eddie?

05:35.100 --> 05:37.000
Just the best present ever.

05:37.400 --> 05:39.400
How do you describe
this present?

05:39.400 --> 05:41.000
Let's just say
nobody else should bother

05:41.000 --> 05:43.300
exchanging presents.
That's how good it is.

05:43.300 --> 05:44.500
Whoa.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.200
I can't believe you're actually
trash-talking christmas presents.

05:49.300 --> 05:51.100
What is it?

05:51.300 --> 05:52.900
You're not gonna tell me?

05:52.900 --> 05:55.000
I told you what kind
of pie crust my mom likes.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.100
And we both know ????????

05:56.100 --> 05:58.200
I've been chasing after
for years.

05:58.500 --> 06:00.700
Last one.
Can I go wrap presents now?

06:00.700 --> 06:02.600
No, we got salted butter.

06:02.600 --> 06:05.100
I need unsalted butter
for the pies!

06:06.200 --> 06:09.700
Sal's deli. Open till 4:00.
Unsalted butter.

06:09.700 --> 06:11.000
Stat.

06:13.100 --> 06:16.000
It's not too late to, uh, 
trim the guest list.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.600
Bet your parents haven't
left from the cape yet.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.600
No, I have always wanted
to do this--

06:20.600 --> 06:22.500
the big dinner, 
all the kids running around, 

06:22.600 --> 06:24.000
my parents...

06:24.100 --> 06:28.000
I just want it to be perfect, 
so it's a lot.

06:30.300 --> 06:32.700
Are you sure you don't want
to tell me what you got eddie?

06:32.700 --> 06:35.000
You know, best friend stamp
of approval?

06:35.500 --> 06:37.700
Not necessary, 
but I will say this--

06:37.700 --> 06:39.800
it is going
to be life-changing

06:39.800 --> 06:42.900
in the best possible way.

06:47.200 --> 06:49.600
So she wipes the gingerbread
off my lip, 

06:49.600 --> 06:52.500
and the next thing I know, 
we're makin' out.

06:52.500 --> 06:54.700
Explain to me again
how gingerbread, 

06:54.700 --> 06:57.200
the most innocent baked good
in history, leads to sex.

06:57.200 --> 06:59.900
Most likely, 
it was the rum-laced eggnog.

07:00.000 --> 07:00.800
Here.

07:02.300 --> 07:03.600
All I know is

07:03.600 --> 07:05.200
it's the first time
I looked at alison

07:05.200 --> 07:06.900
without seeing
the ghost of ikey.

07:06.900 --> 07:08.400
That's a step.

07:11.500 --> 07:14.400
That might be the sorriest-looking
tree I have ever seen.

07:14.800 --> 07:18.100
It's got a bald spot
and maybe tennis elbow.

07:18.100 --> 07:20.600
It was the last one
on the lot, and I like it.

07:20.600 --> 07:24.400
Anyway, I decided I'm gonna
do santa for the kids, 

07:24.600 --> 07:26.800
head over there tonight
with a bagful of presents.

07:26.800 --> 07:28.600
Does the commander
still have that santa suit

07:28.600 --> 07:29.900
he used to wear
when we were little?

07:29.900 --> 07:31.800
The one with the candied yam stains?
Yeah.

07:32.600 --> 07:35.500
We could look for it. I gotta
find decorations, anyway.

07:36.300 --> 07:39.900
It could be big for you, huh?
Like, reunion big.

07:40.800 --> 07:43.300
I just know I don't
want to be mad anymore.

07:43.500 --> 07:45.300
I'm tired of being mad.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.900
Hey, dad, what was
the name of that song

07:49.900 --> 07:52.500
that you and mom
danced to that last christmas?

07:53.100 --> 07:54.300
What are you doing?

07:56.000 --> 07:57.400
Putting up a tree.

07:57.600 --> 07:59.500
Well, I can see that.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.500
Didn't you ever think

08:01.500 --> 08:03.600
there wasn't a tree
for a reason?

08:03.600 --> 08:06.700
Well, I just assumed you guys
didn't have any stuff around

08:06.700 --> 08:08.800
'cause it was just
you and ronnie.But, ..Mm-hmm.

08:08.800 --> 08:09.900
You know, 
now that I'm back--

08:09.900 --> 08:11.700
we don't do christmas.

08:13.900 --> 08:14.900
Why not?

08:16.100 --> 08:18.000
It upsets your brother.

08:18.200 --> 08:21.100
Uh, reminds him, 
you know?

08:21.300 --> 08:22.700
It does?

08:23.800 --> 08:24.700
I had no idea.

08:24.700 --> 08:26.400
Maybe if you asked
a few questions

08:26.400 --> 08:29.100
before you went out and bought
this sorry-looking tree.

08:29.100 --> 08:30.900
It was the last one
on the lot.

08:30.900 --> 08:33.299
And now it's the last one
in the living room.

08:33.299 --> 08:35.299
Get it out of here before
your brother gets home.

08:35.299 --> 08:36.200
* Oh, by golly *

08:36.200 --> 08:41.200
* have a holly, 
jolly christmas this year *

08:54.300 --> 08:57.000
I can't believe I don't get
to meet your parents tonight.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.400
And I can't believe you made
a reindeer out of a soda can.

09:01.400 --> 09:02.800
He's beautiful.

09:03.200 --> 09:03.800
He?

09:04.600 --> 09:06.700
Santa's reindeer
are all male.

09:07.100 --> 09:08.100
Are not.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.700
They have
strong, masculine names, 

09:10.700 --> 09:14.200
like dancer, dasher, 
prance comet--

09:14.200 --> 09:16.000
nope. No sale, bub.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.500
Male reindeer lose their antlers
long before december 25th, 

09:19.500 --> 09:21.800
while females retain theirs
until january.

09:21.800 --> 09:23.000
So?

09:23.400 --> 09:25.800
So the reindeer
pulling santa's sleigh

09:25.800 --> 09:29.400
are always shown with antlers, 
which makes them female.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.500
See now I could argue that, 

09:31.500 --> 09:33.900
and  could get into
this whole disputation

09:33.900 --> 09:36.100
on gender bias and caribou, 

09:36.100 --> 09:37.700
or I could simply rejoice
in the fact

09:37.700 --> 09:40.900
that my girlfriend possesses
that kind of arcane knowledge.

09:40.900 --> 09:42.700
And I could rejoice
in the fact

09:42.700 --> 09:44.900
that you just called me
your girlfriend.

09:44.900 --> 09:46.300
Well, you are.

09:47.800 --> 09:50.000
You are the wind
beneath my hooves.

09:55.400 --> 09:57.500
Maybe I should bail
on vermont.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.500
Maybe I stay here, 

10:00.700 --> 10:02.400
meet your folks...

10:02.400 --> 10:04.100
Maybe we get snowed in.

10:04.100 --> 10:05.300
Oh, how cool would it be

10:05.300 --> 10:07.300
to have a legit reason
not to leave the house?

10:07.300 --> 10:08.700
Yeah...

10:10.500 --> 10:11.600
But, uh, it sounded like

10:11.600 --> 10:13.800
your aunt and uncle
really wanted to see you.

10:14.700 --> 10:15.900
It's true.

10:16.900 --> 10:19.800
You should probably hit the road
before the storm starts.

10:20.100 --> 10:21.100
Yeah.

10:21.100 --> 10:24.600
Well, I gotta say, phil, 
your parents

10:24.600 --> 10:26.000
must be pretty great.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.600
I mean, most of the time
it's the kids who fly home.

10:30.200 --> 10:32.000
It's nice
that they get you.

10:32.100 --> 10:33.600
Definitely.

10:35.300 --> 10:37.200
Merry christmas.

10:43.400 --> 10:44.900
Call me when
you get there, okay?

10:44.900 --> 10:46.700
Okay.
Okay.

10:46.700 --> 10:48.300
I'll see you in a couple days.
All right.

10:50.200 --> 10:51.700
Drive safe.

10:55.200 --> 10:57.800
She gone? She's gone.
Let's get to work.

11:16.700 --> 11:18.000
Oh, hey.

11:18.100 --> 11:20.600
I was just, uh, 
just taking this out.

11:20.600 --> 11:22.400
Uh, I'm no expert, 

11:22.400 --> 11:24.900
but being that
it's christmas eve, 

11:24.900 --> 11:27.200
isn't it supposed to go
the other way?

11:27.200 --> 11:31.600
Yeah, but dad told me about
your thing with christmas, 

11:31.600 --> 11:34.200
so I was just trying
to respect that, you know?

11:34.200 --> 11:35.400
What's my thing with christmas?

11:35.400 --> 11:36.500
I got a thing with christmas?

11:36.500 --> 11:38.200
I love that I got a thing
with christmas. What...

11:38.200 --> 11:39.700
You don't like it.

11:41.100 --> 11:44.100
I don't... Well, I don't
really remember much about it.

11:44.200 --> 11:47.600
I mean, we haven't--
we haven't celebrated since...

11:48.000 --> 11:48.800
You know.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.400
So christmas
doesn't upset you?

11:51.800 --> 11:53.400
The memory of mom?

11:55.600 --> 11:59.900
Truth is, I-I don't really
remember much about mom

12:00.200 --> 12:01.500
I try to.

12:01.600 --> 12:04.200
I mean, I look
at old pictures, but it...

12:05.900 --> 12:07.400
It's weird, huh?

12:07.700 --> 12:09.300
I don't understand.
Why would dad lie?

12:09.300 --> 12:12.300
I don't really talk
about that sort of stuff.

12:12.300 --> 12:14.200
I mean, 
maybe he just assumed.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.400
No, 
it wasn't an assumption.

12:15.400 --> 12:18.700
It was more like
a declaration.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.300
Well, 
if it doesn't bother you, 

12:21.300 --> 12:23.400
maybe we can bring this tree
back inside.

12:23.400 --> 12:24.900
Nicky, this tree is--

12:24.900 --> 12:27.600
it was the last one
on the lot.

12:27.600 --> 12:28.800
Really?

12:29.300 --> 12:31.900
I'm surprised they had
such a nice one left.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.500
I hope you said
being the lead architect

12:44.500 --> 12:46.800
qualifies you
to make those decions.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.400
No, what I said was, 

12:48.400 --> 12:50.700
"if you don't agree to new
hardwood, in three months, 

12:50.700 --> 12:53.400
you're gonna have a bathtub
in your living room."

12:56.500 --> 12:59.400
How did you tell him?
You don't speak italian.

12:59.700 --> 13:02.200
Oh, I always have a translator
when I work in europe.

13:02.200 --> 13:03.600
A translator.

13:03.600 --> 13:04.900
Imagine that, lynn.

13:04.900 --> 13:07.500
Your son has a translator.

13:07.500 --> 13:08.700
How do you say, 

13:08.700 --> 13:11.700
"you make me very proud"
in italian?

13:11.700 --> 13:14.500
You-a make-a me very-a proud-a.

13:16.500 --> 13:18.000
Oh.
Excuse me.

13:22.500 --> 13:23.700
Surprise!

13:23.700 --> 13:25.900
Uh, hi.

13:26.300 --> 13:27.400
What are you doing here?

13:27.400 --> 13:29.500
Ugh, the roads
were getting really bad, 

13:29.500 --> 13:32.000
so I turned around and...

13:33.100 --> 13:34.800
What's going on here?

13:37.200 --> 13:40.500
Um, mom, dad...

13:41.300 --> 13:43.000
I'd like you
to meet someone.

13:59.800 --> 14:01.000
I don't know.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.200
I mean, maybe dad lied

14:03.200 --> 14:04.900
because he doesn't
like christmas.

14:04.900 --> 14:06.700
Dad loved christmas.

14:07.200 --> 14:09.100
He and mom had
this one song

14:09.100 --> 14:11.800
that they danced to
the last christmas.

14:12.100 --> 14:13.000
You don't remember?

14:13.000 --> 14:17.500
I kind of remember them dancing, 
but I don't remember a song.

14:17.800 --> 14:19.600
Man, I wish I knew
the name of it.

14:24.000 --> 14:24.700
Wow.

14:26.400 --> 14:29.600
I remember how if dad
was upset about something--

14:29.700 --> 14:32.500
work, whatever, some bonehead
he head to deal with, 

14:32.600 --> 14:36.500
mom always said the one thing
that made everything okay.

14:37.700 --> 14:39.300
How great is that?

14:39.400 --> 14:40.400
Find the person who says

14:40.400 --> 14:42.900
the one thing
that makes it better.

14:47.800 --> 14:49.100
Oh.
Hmm.

14:49.100 --> 14:50.500
Here you go.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.300
I'm sorry we didn't get
anything for you, dear, 

14:53.300 --> 14:54.900
but as I mentioned, 

14:55.000 --> 14:57.600
we didn't know
that philip was seeing anyone.

14:57.700 --> 14:58.900
That's oy.

14:59.100 --> 15:01.300
Christmas is all about
learning new things.

15:02.700 --> 15:03.900
I'm gonna go get
some more desert wine.

15:03.900 --> 15:05.200
Anyone else
want anything?

15:05.200 --> 15:05.700
I'm good.

15:05.700 --> 15:07.600
No, not for me.
Thank you.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.600
All right. Open.

15:16.800 --> 15:19.800
Hey, what, uh...
What are you doing here?

15:19.800 --> 15:21.100
Truthfully?

15:21.900 --> 15:23.700
Having my mind blown.

15:24.100 --> 15:25.200
You met the parents.

15:25.200 --> 15:26.300
I did.

15:26.300 --> 15:28.800
How is it possible they have
no idea he's a shut-in?

15:28.800 --> 15:31.000
Phil's resourceful.
And you help hi

15:31.000 --> 15:34.400
well, it's not a regular thing.
Just around christmas.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.200
Yeah, don't you just love
this time of year?

15:36.200 --> 15:38.600
Throw a yule log on the fire, 
put the poinsetts

15:38.600 --> 15:40.800
on the hearth, 
lie to your loved ones.

15:40.800 --> 15:42.000
It's not a total lie.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.700
Phil was planning on
becoming an architect

15:43.700 --> 15:46.100
before all this happened.

15:46.100 --> 15:48.900
Ski goggles. Perfect!

15:49.300 --> 15:51.400
Ski goggles?
Oh, he--he didn't tell you

15:51.400 --> 15:53.000
about our trip
to the alps last year?

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
I gotta run.
I just came by to get

15:55.000 --> 15:57.200
their bags out of the car.
Whever, dude.

15:59.600 --> 16:00.500
What's that?

16:00.500 --> 16:02.600
It's from ma to dad.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.800
"Well, we made it
to christmas.

16:04.800 --> 16:07.300
Who would have thought?
Caroline."

16:09.300 --> 16:11.000
What do you think
that means?

16:13.200 --> 16:14.000
I don't know.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.400
You don't think that they
were having problems?

16:17.400 --> 16:18.200
What do you mean?

16:18.200 --> 16:22.400
I mean they
"made it to christmas."

16:22.700 --> 16:25.200
Doesn't that sound
a little grim?

16:31.700 --> 16:33.700
Okay. Ready?

16:34.000 --> 16:34.900
Open it.

16:34.900 --> 16:36.800
I didn't know
we were doing this now.

16:36.800 --> 16:38.400
I don't even have
your present with me.

16:38.400 --> 16:39.700
That's okay.

16:47.100 --> 16:49.200
Remember you told me
how when rocket died, 

16:49.200 --> 16:51.000
the hardest part for you
was plowing

16:51.000 --> 16:52.700
because he was always
by your side?

16:52.700 --> 16:55.200
Middle of the night, 
you two and the snow?

16:56.100 --> 16:57.700
You got me a dog?

17:00.500 --> 17:02.600
You got me a dog.

17:03.100 --> 17:04.200
You don't...

17:04.900 --> 17:06.300
It's not, um...

17:06.599 --> 17:09.700
A dog is a--is a tremendous
responsibility, janet.

17:09.700 --> 17:10.500
You don't...

17:12.000 --> 17:15.200
I mean, you can't
just give someone a dog.

17:15.400 --> 17:17.599
Well, I figured because
you had a dog and, you know--

17:17.599 --> 17:20.500
I didn't have a dog.
I had rocket.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.300
And there's a reason that i--
that I didn't replace rocket.

17:23.300 --> 17:24.900
It's because
he couldn't be replaced, 

17:24.900 --> 17:26.400
at least
not until I'm ready, 

17:26.400 --> 17:30.400
and... I'm not ready.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.500
I'm sorry.

17:35.100 --> 17:39.300
I didn't mean it as a...
I can take him back.

17:41.500 --> 17:42.700
What--where did you get
this dog?

17:42.700 --> 17:44.600
Monk mcgillicuddy came
into the bar last week

17:44.600 --> 17:45.800
with a litter of puppies.

17:45.800 --> 17:48.100
Monk mcgillicuddy, 
who set fire to the church

17:48.100 --> 17:49.700
our senior year
of high school?

17:49.900 --> 17:51.600
Um, I guess. Why?

17:51.600 --> 17:55.000
No reason except that, uh, 
this is not a puppy.

17:55.300 --> 17:56.800
What do you mean, 
it's not a puppy?

17:56.800 --> 17:57.900
It's a wolf.

17:57.900 --> 17:59.500
What do you mean, 
it's a wolf?

17:59.500 --> 18:02.100
I mean, it's a wolf.

18:04.700 --> 18:06.100
I got you a wolf?

18:06.100 --> 18:09.000
Yeah.
You got me a wolf.

18:17.200 --> 18:20.000
U ?????????

18:20.400 --> 18:21.700
I got him
the worst gift ever.

18:21.700 --> 18:24.100
No, a dog
is the worst gift ever.

18:24.100 --> 18:25.600
A wolf...

18:26.600 --> 18:28.000
I don't even know
how to respond to that.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.200
It's not funny.
He got mad at me.

18:31.500 --> 18:32.900
About the dog
or the wolf?

18:32.900 --> 18:35.200
First about the dog, 
then about the wolf.

18:35.200 --> 18:36.900
Where is the wolf now?

18:36.900 --> 18:38.900
In my garage.

18:38.900 --> 18:41.000
Doing what?
I don't know.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.400
I just hope
he doesn't huff and puff

18:42.400 --> 18:43.500
and blow my house in.

18:43.500 --> 18:45.200
Or worse, try on
your grandma's clothes and wait

18:45.200 --> 18:47.800
for little red riding hood
to come by.

18:52.400 --> 18:53.600
Sorry, she was...

18:53.600 --> 18:56.800
Janet gave her...
Forget it.

18:56.800 --> 18:57.600
Oh.

18:58.600 --> 19:01.000
Mmm. Forgotten.

19:01.200 --> 19:04.241
So listen, 
change of plans.

19:04.241 --> 19:07.458
Unfortunately, christine's
being very difficult.

19:07.458 --> 19:08.912
She's insisting I bring
the twins tonight

19:08.912 --> 19:10.151
instead of tomorrow.

19:10.151 --> 19:11.936
Ray, it's christmas eve.

19:11.936 --> 19:14.504
I know, but there's
th roofing emergcy

19:14.539 --> 19:16.148
I need to deal with
at the rec center, 

19:16.148 --> 19:18.186
so I jt figured, you know, 
it's better to give in.

19:18.186 --> 19:19.798
Besides, 
it'll be easier on you--

19:19.798 --> 19:22.829
less work without them.
I guess.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.459
You'll be back soon?
Yeah, I won't be late.

19:24.459 --> 19:28.795
Okay.
Mmm, I promise. Bye, janet.
Bye

19:29.904 --> 19:33.376
okay, I just--I-I have
to get him something new.

19:33.376 --> 19:35.196
Erase the memory
of the wolf.

19:35.196 --> 19:36.823
I'll get him
the opposite of a wolf--

19:36.823 --> 19:41.156
a sheep.
I'll buy him a sheep.
Okay, we need to relax.

19:41.156 --> 19:43.740
Relax? Have you ever
gotten a guy a wolf?

19:43.740 --> 19:45.116
I haven't gotten
a guy a wolf, 

19:45.116 --> 19:47.121
which is why I'm the person
to listen to right now.

19:47.121 --> 19:51.073
Okay, okay, 
thought I didn't need help.

19:51.073 --> 19:53.672
I need so much help.
What do I do?

19:53.672 --> 19:55.024
Nothing.

19:55.024 --> 19:57.311
You wanna know the opposite
to getting someone a wolf?

19:57.311 --> 20:00.791
You play it cool.
You wait it out.

20:00.791 --> 20:03.068
What if I really messed up?

20:03.078 --> 20:04.938
He seemed so upset.

20:05.400 --> 20:07.233
I upset him.

20:07.234 --> 20:08.639
What if he's
rethinking everything?

20:08.639 --> 20:10.604
Look, I don't know what
eddie's thinking right now, 

20:10.604 --> 20:12.667
but sometimes
people screw up, 

20:12.667 --> 20:16.674
and sometimes they...
They buy each other wolves.

20:16.674 --> 20:18.024
It happens.

20:18.100 --> 20:20.067
And if it's not
something he can handle, 

20:20.067 --> 20:20.936
you should find out now, 

20:20.936 --> 20:23.301
because if there's one thing
I can promise you, 

20:23.301 --> 20:28.429
every relationship has it\'s share
of gift wrapped wolves.

20:42.106 --> 20:43.693
(Sighs) I thought I told you
to get rid of that.

20:43.693 --> 20:46.737
You also told me
ronnie hates christmas.

20:48.300 --> 20:50.015
My mistake.

20:55.908 --> 21:00.017
What was going on with you
and mom her last christmas?

21:03.000 --> 21:05.469
Were you having problems?

21:11.800 --> 21:12.676
Where did you get this?

21:12.676 --> 21:15.695
Is that the real reason
why you don't do christmas?

21:15.695 --> 21:17.500
Because you and mom
were having problems

21:17.500 --> 21:20.848
and it's too painful?
I don't want to talk
about it.

21:20.848 --> 21:22.368
Oh, you don't want
to talk about it, right, 

21:22.368 --> 21:24.768
so it never
gets talked about?
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

21:24.768 --> 21:28.607
I have a right to know.
Oh, you have a right.
What right do you have?

21:28.607 --> 21:31.710
Because I have my own life
and my own ideas, 

21:31.710 --> 21:33.706
and they're my memories, 
too, dad.

21:33.706 --> 21:36.462
If, for some reason, I don't
have the full story, well...

21:47.413 --> 21:51.535
Your mother and i
had some trouble.

21:51.570 --> 21:54.412
Yeah, that's right.

21:54.412 --> 21:55.519
Is that what you want?

21:55.519 --> 21:57.351
Look, I just want
the truth.

21:57.351 --> 21:59.682
The truth is...

21:59.682 --> 22:03.127
<i>I told you
I didn't want to do christmas!</i>

22:03.127 --> 22:05.639
can't you grasp--
I can't find
the old santa suit anywhere.

22:05.639 --> 22:08.322
Do you have any idea
where it is?

22:09.599 --> 22:12.037
There's one place
I di't look yet.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.620
Listen, dad...

22:15.620 --> 22:17.795
Dad!

22:20.400 --> 22:23.488
The white chocolate mousse
on the top is an experiment, 

22:23.488 --> 22:25.494
so I can't vouch
for it\'s consistenc

22:25.494 --> 22:27.719
oh, 
I'm sure it's delicious.

22:27.719 --> 22:30.749
So... Pizza delivery.

22:30.749 --> 22:32.723
That sous like
a helpful job, 

22:32.723 --> 22:33.789
while you're in school.

22:33.789 --> 22:35.894
What do you plan to do
afterwards?

22:35.894 --> 22:37.598
I'm not really sure.

22:37.598 --> 22:39.588
Lately, I have been making
jewelry and housewares

22:39.588 --> 22:41.773
out of found objects.
Come again?

22:41.773 --> 22:44.238
Take, like, a shopping list
someone left

22:44.238 --> 22:45.556
on the floor
in a supermarket, 

22:45.556 --> 22:49.190
something forgotten--i laminate
it and turn it into a bookmark.

22:49.190 --> 22:50.827
Oh.
Hmm.

22:50.827 --> 22:53.299
Um, not just bookmarks, 
though. Lots of stuff.

22:53.299 --> 22:56.037
I turned an old lobster trap
into a coffee table

22:56.037 --> 23:00.249
with lobster bibs
as place mats.

23:00.249 --> 23:03.514
Art is everywhere--
I mean, even in mundane things.

23:03.514 --> 23:07.123
I wanna try to elevate
the simple and overlooked

23:07.123 --> 23:09.453
into something unique
and interesting.

23:09.453 --> 23:12.625
Lynn, isn't there an empty bag
of potato chips in the car?

23:12.625 --> 23:15.829
Maybe we should bring it in
and get ourselves a tea tray.

23:15.829 --> 23:18.197
Huh?
(Laughs) no.

23:18.197 --> 23:19.470
Just ignore him.

23:19.470 --> 23:21.042
That's fine.
She knows I'm kidding, 
don't ya?

23:21.042 --> 23:24.113
Look. A telescope.

23:24.300 --> 23:26.482
Dad.

23:26.682 --> 23:28.374
You know, people take
different paths

23:28.374 --> 23:31.606
to find out what they want
to do. Someone like phil--

23:31.606 --> 23:33.911
he just was lucky in that
he knew what he wanted to do

23:33.911 --> 23:36.320
from an early age.
Yeah.

23:36.320 --> 23:40.023
It's not like that.
And who knows?
That $5 million home

23:40.023 --> 23:41.797
philly's building in aspen

23:41.797 --> 23:46.385
might just need a doorstop
made out of a cereal box.

23:46.385 --> 23:48.546
Dad...
Relax, philly.

23:48.567 --> 23:50.697
We're playin', right, sweetie?

23:50.700 --> 23:52.779
Sure. Fun times.

23:53.447 --> 23:57.357
(Chuckles) well, in that case, son
check this out.

23:57.357 --> 23:59.992
An edible paperweight.

24:02.800 --> 24:05.192
I haven't left the house
in six years.

24:06.900 --> 24:09.636
It's true. Six years.

24:09.636 --> 24:11.292
Shut-in.

24:12.231 --> 24:13.751
Me.

24:15.806 --> 24:16.709
What do you mean?

24:16.709 --> 24:20.138
What I just said. Six years.
I'm not an architect.

24:20.138 --> 24:22.249
I do not have a translator.

24:22.249 --> 24:25.854
I am the neighborhood weirdo.
My greatest accomplishment--

24:25.854 --> 24:27.955
when the kids on this block
play catch, 

24:27.955 --> 24:31.538
if a ball rolls onto our lawn, 
they leave it there, 

24:31.538 --> 24:36.391
because they're too scared
to retrieve it.

24:37.100 --> 24:46.867
* ...Your christmases *

24:46.867 --> 24:52.001
* be white *

24:52.067 --> 24:53.573
* jingle bells, jingle bells *

24:53.573 --> 25:03.021
* jingle all the way ooh*

25:05.980 --> 25:10.223
* with boughs of holly, 
fa-la-la-la-la, la-la, la-la *

25:10.258 --> 25:14.915
* 'tis the season to be jolly, 
fa-la-la-la-la, la-la, la-la *

25:14.950 --> 25:19.519
* don we now our gay apparel, 
fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la *

25:19.554 --> 25:21.715
* troll
the ancient yuletide carol *

25:21.750 --> 25:24.212
* fa-la-la-la-la, la-la, la-la *
(engine starts)

25:27.600 --> 25:29.858
* see the blazing yule
before us *

25:29.893 --> 25:32.134
* fa-la-la-la-la, la-la, la-la *
(whirring)

25:32.169 --> 25:34.366
* strike the harp
and join the chorus *

25:34.401 --> 25:37.700
* fa-la-la-la-la, la-la, la-la *
(sighs) why didn't I get chains?

25:38.700 --> 25:41.426
* Follow me in merry measure, 
fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la *

25:41.461 --> 25:43.276
after the towers fell, 

25:43.447 --> 25:44.681
I sat inside, 

25:44.716 --> 25:48.265
watching everything I could, 
reading everything I could.

25:48.300 --> 25:49.847
I didn't leave.

25:49.847 --> 25:53.169
And the more I didn't leave, 
the more I couldn't leave.

25:53.236 --> 25:57.172
It's hard to explain, and I know
it's hard to understand.

25:57.207 --> 26:00.357
I'm gonna give you
a dose of reality, 

26:00.392 --> 26:02.263
because obviously
no one else around here

26:02.263 --> 26:03.567
wants you to have one.

26:03.567 --> 26:06.687
You know what it sounds like?
It sounds...

26:06.722 --> 26:08.520
Like you're a coward.

26:08.555 --> 26:10.944
Randall--
no, he's right.

26:13.010 --> 26:14.728
I am.

26:15.776 --> 26:19.116
I... I just don't understand
why you lied to us.

26:19.116 --> 26:21.443
You wanted an architect.

26:21.478 --> 26:24.931
So... Every christmas
I give you an architect.

26:27.943 --> 26:29.120
But why?

26:29.120 --> 26:31.872
I didn't wanna
disappoint you.

26:32.696 --> 26:33.130
And now...

26:33.165 --> 26:37.637
Oh, sweetheart, 
you don't understand.

26:37.672 --> 26:41.219
<i>we're not disappointed
in you.</i>

26:41.236 --> 26:44.154
<i>we're disappointed
for you.</i>

26:51.726 --> 26:54.898
hey! You think
alison will like this?

26:54.933 --> 26:58.924
I want 'em all to be surprised, 
but not in a bad or a weird way.

26:58.959 --> 27:02.107
I think I'll just walk in
and--and say, 

27:02.142 --> 27:04.272
"ho-ho...

27:05.243 --> 27:06.962
Ho."

27:13.249 --> 27:14.810
Hey.

27:14.810 --> 27:15.845
Look what I found in the pocket

27:15.845 --> 27:19.370
of the candied-yam-stained
santa suit.

27:32.200 --> 27:34.577
Merry christmas to all...

27:34.580 --> 27:36.361
To all, a good night.

27:36.513 --> 27:38.417
Merry christmas, owen.

27:48.367 --> 27:50.371
This was it.

27:50.373 --> 27:54.305
This it that song--
the one you danced to.

27:54.340 --> 27:57.760
Yeah. I remember that.

28:02.500 --> 28:06.357
<i>* he's gone *</i>

28:06.392 --> 28:10.445
<i>* 2000 miles *</i>

28:11.493 --> 28:14.710
I knew it was a mistake
getting him that camera, car.

28:14.745 --> 28:18.603
Well, this way, you guys will
always remember never to forget.

28:18.638 --> 28:21.556
<i>* ...Falling down *</i>

28:21.591 --> 28:26.000
<i>* it gets colder day by day *</i>

28:26.000 --> 28:32.100
<i>* I miss you *</i>

28:32.100 --> 28:35.500
<i>* the children will sing *</i>

28:35.500 --> 28:40.524
<i>* he'll be back
at christmastime *</i>

28:43.000 --> 28:44.600
I love you.

28:44.600 --> 28:48.856
<i>this way, you guys will always
remember never to forget.</i>

28:48.891 --> 28:51.370
you weren't having
any problems in your marriage.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.270
She knew
she was gonna die.

28:58.305 --> 29:00.531
Didn't she?

29:04.675 --> 29:05.949
What?

29:05.984 --> 29:09.182
That's what "we made it
to christmas" meant.

29:10.600 --> 29:11.866
She knew?

29:11.866 --> 29:13.865
We both knew.

29:14.802 --> 29:17.414
But how? The aneurysm
came out of nowhere, right?

29:17.414 --> 29:20.451
No. (Sighs) it wasn't.

29:21.623 --> 29:24.414
It was a... Condition.

29:24.660 --> 29:26.851
It was inoperable.

29:27.362 --> 29:29.182
Whene found out, 

29:29.182 --> 29:33.435
the doctor told us it was
just a matter of time...

29:33.470 --> 29:37.719
And that we should
consider ourselves lucky

29:37.754 --> 29:40.135
if she made it to christmas.

29:41.474 --> 29:43.638
Was she scared?

29:47.400 --> 29:52.844
You knew that...
She was gonna die, and... (Scoffs)

29:52.879 --> 29:54.204
you didn't tell us?

29:54.205 --> 29:56.252
She didn't want you to worry.

29:56.287 --> 29:58.200
So you let us walk around, 
not knowing

29:58.200 --> 30:02.335
that our mother could die
in any second?
We made a choice.
You were kids.

30:02.335 --> 30:04.574
I was 16!
Oh, nick...

30:04.609 --> 30:06.394
<i>no!</i>

30:07.400 --> 30:09.481
no.

30:11.200 --> 30:15.646
* The snow's falling down *

30:15.681 --> 30:20.159
* it gets colder day by day *

30:20.300 --> 30:22.488
* I miss you *

30:22.523 --> 30:24.374
you okay?

30:24.409 --> 30:25.127
Not really.

30:25.127 --> 30:28.654
I'm stuck in the snow.
My phone won't work.

30:28.689 --> 30:30.711
My kids are with my mother, 
and, uh...

30:30.746 --> 30:32.447
I need to get home.

30:32.482 --> 30:35.271
Uh, I got my truck.

30:35.306 --> 30:36.973
I'm not getting
in your truck.

30:37.008 --> 30:40.244
Alison, it's christmas eve.
You're stranded.

30:40.279 --> 30:42.353
Let me give you a ride.

30:44.400 --> 30:46.312
If ray doesn't make it home
in time, 

30:46.312 --> 30:48.327
it might be you and me
having brandy and cigars

30:48.327 --> 30:51.784
after dinner with my dad.
(Chuckles)
sure.

30:51.819 --> 30:53.028
I'll be back soon.

30:53.130 --> 30:54.870
I'm going to doodie's
to drop off his present.

30:54.905 --> 30:58.397
Now? It's snowing pretty heavy
out there.

30:58.432 --> 31:00.521
It's three blocks.

31:00.533 --> 31:02.463
Okay, fine.
Just be back soon.

31:02.498 --> 31:03.244
All right.

31:07.600 --> 31:08.539
Hello?

31:10.937 --> 31:12.619
Oh, sure.

31:12.619 --> 31:14.110
Hang on a sec.

31:14.145 --> 31:15.907
(Whispering) it's him.

31:16.700 --> 31:19.381
Attempt to be cool.

31:25.600 --> 31:27.220
Hello?

31:27.255 --> 31:29.135
Hi, eddie.

31:30.283 --> 31:31.611
Now?

31:31.646 --> 31:34.910
Um, well, I'm kind of helping
hannah with some--

31:36.499 --> 31:37.699
okay.

31:37.734 --> 31:39.805
That's fine.

31:39.840 --> 31:42.088
I'll see you in a bit.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.090
Eddie wants to go
for a ride.

31:45.090 --> 31:46.921
Oh, this is great.

31:46.956 --> 31:48.069
I don't wanna leave you
alone, though.

31:48.104 --> 31:49.112
I mean, all your hard work
and--

31:49.203 --> 31:53.159
are you kidding? It's one
less person to clean up after.

31:54.073 --> 31:55.671
I'm fine.

31:56.400 --> 31:58.548
Okay, here's what
you need to do.

31:59.500 --> 32:03.636
* It must be christmastime *

32:06.700 --> 32:09.307
* I hear people singing *

32:10.300 --> 32:13.475
* it must be christmastime *

32:25.373 --> 32:27.225
mom, I understand.

32:28.700 --> 32:32.035
No, I don't want you and dad
driving in the storm, either.

32:35.300 --> 32:37.225
I love you, too.

32:38.946 --> 32:41.288
Merry christmas.

32:52.472 --> 32:55.512
Thank you for protecting me
tonight.

32:55.973 --> 32:59.267
Thank you
for defending me tonight.

32:59.302 --> 33:02.185
I am merely the wind
beneath your hooves.

33:04.800 --> 33:06.959
It's always meant a lot

33:06.994 --> 33:09.823
to have them
be proud of me.

33:10.106 --> 33:12.583
But tonight
something shifted, 

33:13.916 --> 33:18.056
and I saw myself
through your eyes, 

33:18.091 --> 33:20.919
and I didn't care
what they thought anymore.

33:20.954 --> 33:23.939
I wanted you
to be proud of me.

33:36.306 --> 33:39.096
Merry christmas, 
"physical phil" farmer.

33:39.096 --> 33:41.469
Merry christmas, 
pizza girl.

33:44.165 --> 33:49.393
(Man) * see the pyramids
along the nile *

33:49.428 --> 33:54.676
* watch the sunrise
from a tropic isle *

33:56.000 --> 33:57.706
I wanted to get you
a leopard, 

33:57.706 --> 33:59.839
but they were fresh out.

34:00.332 --> 34:05.094
* You belong to me *

34:05.173 --> 34:10.475
* see the marketplace
in old algiers *

34:10.900 --> 34:12.663
how did you know
my middle name?

34:12.697 --> 34:17.279
I know I haven't told you...
On purpose.

34:17.313 --> 34:21.246
Hey, I can do some research...
Edith.

34:21.282 --> 34:24.478
* You belong to me *

34:25.500 --> 34:28.993
I'm sorry for the way
I reacted before.

34:29.172 --> 34:33.444
I just wasn't expecting
a present so... (Chuckles)

34:33.478 --> 34:34.695
it's a lot to get a wolf.

34:34.695 --> 34:39.176
<i>tell me about it.
It's a lot to give a wolf.
(Chuckles)</i>

34:42.206 --> 34:45.618
try this instead, 
for your long night.

34:52.606 --> 34:54.675
One thermos
is, uh, tomato soup, 

34:54.710 --> 34:57.186
and one thermos
is hot chocolate.

34:57.221 --> 35:00.546
Wow. That's eat.

35:01.401 --> 35:03.540
Thank you.

35:07.700 --> 35:09.827
But, um...

35:09.862 --> 35:13.145
U know what
I really want?

35:13.485 --> 35:16.085
Not dog... Or a wolf...

35:16.400 --> 35:23.226
But...For you to come with me.

35:23.261 --> 35:24.976
Now I know cleaning
the streets of knights ridge

35:25.011 --> 35:27.358
isn't the most festive way to
spend the evening, but it is--

35:27.393 --> 35:31.527
exactly what I wanna do
on christmas eve.

35:35.220 --> 35:40.244
* You belong to me *

35:40.279 --> 35:44.547
* you belong to me *

35:44.700 --> 35:45.653
hey.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.252
Hey.

35:48.700 --> 35:50.113
<i>what are you doing?</i>

35:53.313 --> 35:56.015
I don't know, actually.
You?

35:56.050 --> 35:57.297
Don't know.

35:58.500 --> 36:00.319
It's the last place
I thought I'd find myself

36:00.339 --> 36:04.790
on christmas eve--
alone, on the street.

36:04.825 --> 36:06.677
Yeah.

36:06.712 --> 36:08.319
Me, too.

36:10.914 --> 36:12.453
You okay?

36:13.966 --> 36:15.681
Not really, hannah.

36:15.716 --> 36:17.735
Well, what is it?

36:18.600 --> 36:22.549
Turns out that my mother knew
that she was gonna die--

36:22.584 --> 36:27.952
she and my dad, 
and... They never told us.

36:27.987 --> 36:30.479
Oh, my god.
I get it, you know?

36:30.514 --> 36:33.048
I mean, they were trying
to protect us, but...

36:33.083 --> 36:38.344
But we... We could've
said good-bye, and...

36:38.349 --> 36:41.058
We never got the chance.

36:41.093 --> 36:43.995
I am so sorry, nick.

36:44.030 --> 36:44.724
Yeah.

36:44.759 --> 36:46.363
God, it's the worst
that we don't get to control

36:46.363 --> 36:51.598
when people leave us, 
but you know what she got?

36:51.633 --> 36:56.403
She got to know that her kids
weren't living in fear.

36:56.769 --> 37:00.377
So it turns out that you gave
her the best gift possible.

37:00.412 --> 37:03.794
I mean, wh could be
better than that?

37:03.829 --> 37:07.730
You know the last thing she saw
was bogart kissing bergman?

37:07.767 --> 37:10.834
That sounds pretty awesome, 
if you ask me.

37:16.000 --> 37:19.040
Our next lucky victims.

37:19.075 --> 37:20.633
Kiss, you two.

37:20.800 --> 37:22.981
(Chuckles nervously)
no, we're good. It's...

37:23.016 --> 37:26.400
Come on. You have to. Do you
want bad luck for the new year?

37:38.701 --> 37:40.406
Boo!

37:40.441 --> 37:43.159
Boo!
(Woman) bah humbug.

37:51.302 --> 37:53.429
You gonna be okay?

37:53.773 --> 37:55.556
Yeah. (Sniffles)

37:56.754 --> 37:58.558
hey.

37:58.593 --> 38:00.311
And, uh...

38:00.346 --> 38:02.215
Just for the record, I...

38:02.250 --> 38:03.479
Really didn't think
there was anything

38:03.479 --> 38:06.336
that could make me
feel better tonight.

38:08.000 --> 38:11.160
Thanks for finding
the one thing that did.

38:13.564 --> 38:15.224
Merry christmas, nick.

38:15.500 --> 38:17.884
Merry christmas, 
hannah jane.

38:26.200 --> 38:29.687
* This very moment
says the past *

38:29.722 --> 38:31.656
* it's likely
you're just dreamin' *

38:31.691 --> 38:33.891
* of virtually someone else *

38:33.926 --> 38:37.836
* our hands, they hold
the candle to the page*

38:37.871 --> 38:42.020
* theseays, they go so fast *

38:42.055 --> 38:46.106
* these days of ours *

38:46.141 --> 38:49.644
* follow the lights *

38:49.679 --> 38:51.675
* that line the streets *

38:51.710 --> 38:54.958
* connecting telephones *

38:54.993 --> 38:57.706
* follow the lights *

38:57.741 --> 38:58.819
* from house to house *

38:59.472 --> 39:02.154
* and they will lead you *

39:02.189 --> 39:02.967
* home *

39:03.002 --> 39:06.431
* they will lead you home *

39:06.466 --> 39:07.942
* 'cause there was never *

39:08.073 --> 39:11.057
* anywhere to go *

39:11.092 --> 39:15.137
* there was never
anywhere to go *

39:15.172 --> 39:18.128
* but home *

39:24.495 --> 39:25.773
hey.

39:27.015 --> 39:28.123
Hey.

39:28.123 --> 39:31.419
It's gonna be a monster
tonight, huh?

39:31.454 --> 39:33.984
Pfft. Big-time.

39:36.487 --> 39:38.599
Merry christmas, ikey.

39:39.935 --> 39:42.062
Merry christmas, eddie.

39:44.273 --> 39:48.092
* Everything we always dreamed *

39:48.127 --> 39:52.112
* our memories of attics
in those houses on the hill *

39:52.147 --> 39:56.383
* our love is there above us, 
holding everything so still *

39:56.418 --> 40:00.297
* and we are always here *

40:00.332 --> 40:04.526
* yes, we are always here *

40:04.561 --> 40:08.166
* so follow the lights *

40:08.173 --> 40:09.040
* that line the streets... *

40:09.706 --> 40:11.373
Everything okay?

40:17.400 --> 40:19.272
You know what I'd like?

40:19.307 --> 40:21.220
What's that?

40:21.220 --> 40:23.493
For the three of us
to sit here...

40:25.536 --> 40:29.669
And for you guys
to tell me about my mom.

40:35.957 --> 40:37.942
What do you say, pops?

40:43.600 --> 40:46.601
I'd say...

40:46.636 --> 40:49.058
I can't think of anything
in the world

40:49.093 --> 40:51.418
I'd rather do this night.

40:56.841 --> 41:00.561
Whew. Well, 
here's one for you, ronnie.

41:00.596 --> 41:02.638
When you were
a little boy...

41:02.673 --> 41:07.385
* 'Cause there was never
anywhere to go *

41:07.420 --> 41:11.581
* there was
never anywhere to go *

41:11.616 --> 41:15.852
* there was never anywhere
to go *
(wolf howls)

41:15.887 --> 41:18.374
* but home *

41:18.673 --> 41:21.506
* home *
