No, it's, uh, Father O'Malley.

16:46.463 --> 16:48.756
Hmm, I know a Father Shaughnessy.

16:48.924 --> 16:50.717
Shaughnessy. Exactly. What did I say?

16:50.884 --> 16:52.885
We're just happy to be here now, Father.

16:53.053 --> 16:56.014
And we're happy to have you. We could
use some young blood around here.

16:56.181 --> 16:59.475
Hmm. Listen, I gotta ask, and no offense,
but the neighborhood--?

16:59.643 --> 17:01.894
It's gone to seed a little,
there's no denying.

17:02.062 --> 17:04.313
That's why what the church
does here is important.

17:04.772 --> 17:08.358
You can expect a miracle, but in
the meantime, you work your butt off.

17:08.777 --> 17:10.111
We heard about the murders.

17:10.279 --> 17:13.656
Yes. The victims were parishioners of mine.
I'd known them for years.

17:13.824 --> 17:16.867
And the killers said that an angel
made them do that?

17:17.036 --> 17:18.618
Yes. Misguided souls.

17:18.787 --> 17:22.457
To think that God's messenger
would appear and incite people to murder.

17:22.624 --> 17:25.792
-It's tragic.
-So you don't believe in those angel yarns?

17:25.961 --> 17:29.422
Oh, no, I absolutely believe.
Kind of goes with the job description.

17:30.174 --> 17:31.883
Father, that's Michael, right?

17:32.843 --> 17:37.972
That's right, the Archangel Michael
with the flaming sword.

17:38.140 --> 17:40.725
A fighter of demons.

17:41.101 --> 17:43.394
And a holy force against evil.

17:43.562 --> 17:47.148
So they're not really the Hallmark-card
version that everybody thinks?

17:47.316 --> 17:49.400
They're fierce, right? Vigilant.

17:49.568 --> 17:52.111
I like to think of them
as more loving than wrathful.

17:52.946 --> 17:57.658
But, yes, a lot of Scripture
paints angels as God's warriors.

17:57.826 --> 18:03.790
An angel of the Lord appeared to them,
glory of the Lord shone down upon them...

18:03.957 --> 18:06.125

-Hey, Father. What's all that for?

18:26.563 --> 18:29.524
REYNOLDS: Oh, that's for Father Gregory.
He was a priest here.

18:29.691 --> 18:30.900
Was?

18:31.068 --> 18:32.944
Passed away right on these steps.

18:33.112 --> 18:36.322
-He's interred in the church crypt.
-When did this happen?

18:36.490 --> 18:39.784
Two months ago.
He was shot for his car keys.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.537
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah, me too.

18:42.704 --> 18:44.372
He was a good friend.

to administer his last rites.

I've been praying my heart out.

-For deliverance.

around here.

a little divine intervention, I suppose.

He knew the other stiffs,
they went to church here.

19:30.794 --> 19:32.753

because he was their priest...
