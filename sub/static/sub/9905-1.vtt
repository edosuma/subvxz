WEBVTT

02:23.877 --> 02:27.515
-It's perfect.
-Oh great!

02:27.581 --> 02:31.419
-I'll take it!
-Oh, wonderful! It's just...
There's one thing.

02:31.485 --> 02:34.722
-I'm going to need
some references.
-I don't have any of those.

02:34.788 --> 02:39.327
Oh dear. That's serious.
I don't know that we can
do business together.

02:39.393 --> 02:41.195
if you don't have references.

02:44.765 --> 02:46.767
Bye, now!

03:37.851 --> 03:39.753
-Daddy...
-What's going on, Isabel?

03:39.820 --> 03:42.423
(SIGHS)
I'm moving here.

03:42.490 --> 03:44.825
To the Valley?
Why on earth
would you do that?

03:44.892 --> 03:46.894
Because it's normal.

03:46.960 --> 03:50.163
-You're normal. You're just...
-I know. But I'm not going to
be one anymore.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.466
You have no choice
in the matter.
It's what you are.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.602
Orange is a great color.
Orange is happy.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.637
Happy?
Why don't we just
paint it yellow?

03:56.704 --> 03:58.806
We can't paint it yellow.
We're going to
paint the bathroom yellow.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.408
Since when are we
painting the bathroom yellow?

04:00.474 --> 04:03.611
-They're arguing about paint.
-Yes, I can see that.

04:03.677 --> 04:06.847
-I want to argue about paint.
-With whom?

04:06.914 --> 04:09.550
-With someone.
-A man?

04:09.617 --> 04:11.452
-Yes!
-Oh Isabel...

04:11.519 --> 04:13.721
I'm through with warlocks.
They're all just like you.

04:13.787 --> 04:17.524
Even when you and Mother were
married, you were always
casting spells on other women.

04:17.591 --> 04:20.928
Your life is total
instant gratification, Daddy.

04:20.994 --> 04:24.498
-It's fantastic, isn't it?
-No, no it's not, because
how do you know that

04:24.565 --> 04:26.700
anyone really loves you
for yourself?

04:26.767 --> 04:30.270
It's like those rich men who
are never really sure
why women sleep with them.

04:30.338 --> 04:34.542
But women sleep with them,
so it's not really a problem.

04:34.608 --> 04:38.346
-I want a man who needs me.
-Needs you?

04:38.412 --> 04:43.216
-Mm hmm. Because he is a
completely hopeless mess.

04:43.283 --> 04:46.219
Oh, no. You're talking
about love, aren't you?

04:47.321 --> 04:49.122
-What do you suppose
it's like?

04:49.189 --> 04:52.159
Oh, it's simple. You say,
"I love you" to someone you
want to go home with.

04:52.225 --> 04:56.263
And then when things
get messy, you say,
"I don't love you anymore."

04:56.330 --> 05:01.902
-And that's pretty much it.
-I feel as if I'm pressed
against a glass window.

05:01.969 --> 05:06.907
It's right there on the other
side. I can see it,
but I can't feel it.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.609
I can't touch it.

05:08.676 --> 05:12.980
-Does your mother know
about this?
-She disappeared again.

05:13.046 --> 05:16.950
CASHIER: $420.56.
-Money. Money.

05:25.092 --> 05:27.395
That was my last thing
as a witch.

05:29.630 --> 05:33.300
I want to be like everyone
else. I want to have friends
and I want to...

05:33.367 --> 05:36.870
And I want to go to the Coffee
Bean, where we all discuss our
problems,

05:36.937 --> 05:39.006
which are absolutely
unsolvable.

05:39.072 --> 05:43.276
You can have anything you
want. Every woman
wants to be a witch.

05:43.343 --> 05:47.347
I don't. I want to feel
thwarted. I want days where my
hair is affected by weather.

05:47.415 --> 05:50.951
-Yeah, hi, what can I get you?
-Scrambled eggs, please.

05:51.018 --> 05:54.855
I am through with just
snapping my fingers
and getting my way.

05:54.922 --> 06:03.096
-No breakfast after 11.
-Oh.
My absolutely last thing.

06:03.163 --> 06:08.068
Don't do this. You'll meet
someone, you'll get this close
and when he finds out about...

06:08.135 --> 06:10.838
If he loves me,
he won't care.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.607
I'm going to get an umbrella.

06:16.243 --> 06:22.215
-Go on. Get yourself one.
-No, Daddy. No. I mean it.
No. Never again.

06:22.282 --> 06:25.285
-You'll get wet.
-I hope so.

06:42.369 --> 06:44.938
I know what you're
going to say.
I'm a mess.

06:45.005 --> 06:47.875
-Get a grip, Jack.
Get a grip.
-I can't help it.

06:47.941 --> 06:51.979
-Hey, how do I look?
-You look great.

06:52.045 --> 06:53.681
-I look great?
-Yeah!

06:53.747 --> 06:56.149
I always look great.
That's a given.
And the important thing is...

06:56.216 --> 06:59.487
-What?
-I have no idea what the
important thing is.

06:59.553 --> 07:02.756
I'm telling you, I feel like
I'm about to
go out of my mind.

07:02.823 --> 07:07.394
You know, I want my life back.
Okay? I want my wife
and my house.

07:07.461 --> 07:11.164
I want to be a movie star
again. I mean, what the
hell happened, Richie?

07:11.231 --> 07:13.000
Things were going so great
there for a while.

07:13.066 --> 07:15.268
-Last Year in Katmandu
-Oh don't bring it up.

07:15.335 --> 07:20.273
It cost $140 mill to make and
grossed 1.6 - the only DVD
to sell no copies.

07:20.340 --> 07:22.409
We probably shouldn't have
shot it in black-and-white.

07:22.476 --> 07:25.779
But now you're going to do
a television series and it's
going to be a big hit.

07:25.846 --> 07:28.949
So pull yourself together,
man, because you look like
Don Johnson,

07:29.016 --> 07:30.651
but in a bad way.

07:30.718 --> 07:32.653
-Ok, I got it,
I'll pull myself together.
-Ok? Let's go.

07:32.720 --> 07:35.589
-And don't get all nice on me.
Be mean.
-Going to be mean.

07:35.656 --> 07:38.091
OK?
Be mean. Be mean.
Hit me.

07:38.158 --> 07:41.795
There you go. You're the
Jackerator, baby.
Let's go. Let's go. Come on.

07:41.862 --> 07:45.165
-Yo, gentlemen.
How are you? Oh!
-Hey, hello!

07:45.232 --> 07:46.900
-Jack Wyatt
-Hi, I'm Jack.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.603
-Huge fan, huge.
-How are the kids, guys?

07:49.670 --> 07:51.071
-Good.
-Great!

07:51.138 --> 07:53.473
-Good. Good. Well, let's cut
the chitchat.
-I'm Jack, by the way.

07:53.541 --> 07:55.809
-Nina.
-Jack wants to do the show.

07:55.876 --> 07:57.578
-That's great.
-I want to do it.

07:57.645 --> 08:00.714
-Great. That's terrific.
-He only has one concern.

08:00.781 --> 08:05.553
We have the same concern.
We think everyone's forgotten
about Last Year in Katmandu.

08:05.619 --> 08:11.291
-Unless they saw it.
-His concern is, the witch has
all the fun.

08:11.358 --> 08:15.696
-You will be fun.
-We're changing it
from the original.

08:15.763 --> 08:19.800
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't all go crazy.
Okay? I mean, it is Bewitched.

08:19.867 --> 08:25.138
I mean, Samantha, she should
be strong, right?
This should be a two-hander.

08:25.205 --> 08:28.441
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God. Huh?
Hey. What a relief.

08:28.508 --> 08:32.445
I was worried because Larry
told me you'd want us to tilt
the entire show towards you...

08:32.511 --> 08:34.615
-No, no, no.
-Stu, Stu.

08:34.682 --> 08:37.918
We've got to have a great
ensemble is what I'm thinking.
You know?

08:37.985 --> 08:41.453
Endora, the next-door
neighbors, all those
crazy family members.

08:41.520 --> 08:44.892
Who's going to play Uncle
Arthur? Huh?
I used to love Uncle Arthur.

08:44.958 --> 08:47.127
Well, we're looking for
Uncle Arthur.

08:47.194 --> 08:48.996
-Your table's ready.
-Thank you.

08:49.062 --> 08:51.565
I don't know if you guys
remember this, but when he'd
appear in the mirror

08:51.632 --> 08:54.768
it would crack,
it would always crack.
And you knew it was coming,

08:54.835 --> 08:59.640
and yet, every time it
happened, I laughed
and I laughed and I laughed.

08:59.707 --> 09:01.374
-Can I talk to you
for a second?
-I loved it!

09:01.441 --> 09:03.443
-Can I talk to you?
-"Hiya, Sammy."

09:03.510 --> 09:07.214
One second, fellows.
We'll meet you guys
at the table, all right?

09:07.280 --> 09:11.919
-Hey, I like those guys.
What?
-You're being a pussy.

09:11.985 --> 09:15.022
-What?
-You're being a pussy, pussy,
pussy, pussy, pussy!

09:15.088 --> 09:18.025
-No, I'm not!
I want the show to be good.
-You want the show to be...?

09:18.091 --> 09:22.562
You know what, Jack Wyatt's
doing TV now because
his film career ate it!

09:22.630 --> 09:26.299
And he's not even the clear
star of his own show.
Jack, screw Uncle Arthur.

09:26.366 --> 09:30.070
-Hell, screw ensembles, man.
-I'm being a pussy.

09:30.137 --> 09:33.741
Yes. If this show tanks,
you'll be the bottom right
square on Hollywood Squares

09:33.807 --> 09:37.177
for the next 10 years.
You will also be the mayor
of Pussytown. You read me?

09:37.244 --> 09:38.979
I don't want to be the mayor
of Pussytown.

09:39.046 --> 09:42.082
No, get in there and be
the sheriff of Ballsville,
all right?

09:42.149 --> 09:46.553
-Ok.
-Bring it! Let's go!

09:48.989 --> 09:50.390
-Stop that.
-Sorry. Sorry.

09:50.457 --> 09:52.826
Sorry, guys, where were we?

09:52.893 --> 09:56.396
A couple of big names
are available for Samantha.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.367
-To hell with that.
-Yeah.

10:00.433 --> 10:03.637
I want an unknown in the lead.
All right? A hot new face
that's going to

10:03.704 --> 10:09.009
look good and set me up.
Because I have worked
my ass off to the bone

10:09.076 --> 10:13.681
for too long to build up
the brand value
of the name Jack Wyatt!

10:15.248 --> 10:18.185
-This show has one star.
-And I want three trailers.

10:18.251 --> 10:22.122
-Nobody in television
has three trailers.
-He wants them, you get them.

10:22.189 --> 10:26.694
And I want my own personal
makeup team
in matching jumpsuits.

10:26.760 --> 10:31.699
And a leopard! I want a pet
leopard. With a diamond-
studded collar. Real diamonds.

10:31.765 --> 10:35.402
-That's enough, Jack.
-And a cake.
A two-story-high cake.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.637
Every Wednesday's Cake Day.

10:37.705 --> 10:40.974
And we're going to bring it
out and we're going to
pretend it's a surprise,

10:41.041 --> 10:43.677
because it's Cake Day.
-We get it, Jack.

10:43.744 --> 10:47.881
If we have a leopard, we're
going to have major
insurance issues.

10:47.948 --> 10:51.518
-Well, we're willing to give
on the leopard.
-It's getting hard to breathe.

10:51.584 --> 10:53.721
-Should I be
writing this down?
-No.

10:53.787 --> 10:58.191
So this should be fun.
Huh? Right?

10:58.258 --> 11:00.593
Gosh, I used to have
the biggest crush on
Elizabeth Montgomery

11:00.660 --> 11:03.196
when I was 10 years old.
-We all did.

11:03.263 --> 11:07.634
The nose! I mean...

11:07.701 --> 11:12.605
It's not going to be easy
finding a nobody
to play Samantha.

11:13.206 --> 11:15.275
Be the sheriff.

11:15.342 --> 11:19.479
Well, Jack Wyatt says
get it done, y'all.

11:25.953 --> 11:29.289
Hey! I'm turning on
the sprinklers
in my front yard!

11:33.193 --> 11:35.428
Dimming up...

11:35.495 --> 11:38.465
Dimming down...

11:38.531 --> 11:41.869
Dimming up...

11:42.635 --> 11:45.205
Dimming down...

11:51.411 --> 11:52.880
Wow!

11:52.946 --> 11:57.484
I don't think you quite
understand.
This is very confusing.

11:57.550 --> 12:03.757
I put the black cable in the
red plug like they said
and the screen is still blue.

12:03.824 --> 12:07.194
(DOORBELL)
I'm here to give you cable.

12:07.260 --> 12:10.363
Oh, thank you,
I already have some.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.732
Hello? Don't go away, please.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.971
Oh, to heck with
all this bunk!

12:40.961 --> 12:42.896
There.

12:42.963 --> 12:47.700
Hmm. Let's just keep this
between us, Lucinda.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.738
Is your self-esteem low
because you aren't

12:51.805 --> 12:53.740
participating in
the real world?

12:53.807 --> 12:55.642
-Yes, my self-esteem
is very low.

12:55.708 --> 12:59.246
Well, let's face it,
you need a job.

12:59.312 --> 13:01.414
There's something I
have to tell you, Darrin.

13:01.481 --> 13:02.749
I'm a witch.

13:02.816 --> 13:04.051
I'm a witch.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.353
I am a witch.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.899
Good.
Good.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.931
Oh my goodness.

14:03.977 --> 14:06.646
(SNEEZES)
God bless you.

14:43.650 --> 14:48.188
Don't look, but
Jack Wyatt is
staring at you.

14:50.023 --> 14:53.994
My heart's pounding,
and I am feeling
very weird tingles.

14:54.061 --> 14:58.398
-I know.
He makes me sick, too.
-You know him?

14:58.465 --> 15:03.136
Jack Wyatt, the actor?
Huh.
Where have you been?

15:03.203 --> 15:06.506
-May I join you?
-Uh, sure!

15:08.108 --> 15:10.243
-Hi, I'm Jack Wyatt.
-I know.

15:10.310 --> 15:15.182
Thank you.
Look, I've never done this
before.

15:15.248 --> 15:21.654
-How would you like to be
on a television show? Miss...
-Bigelow.

15:21.721 --> 15:23.856
-Bigelow?
-Mm hmm.

15:23.923 --> 15:27.860
-Isabel Bigelow.
-Oh.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.997
So what do you think?
Do you want to want to be
a famous actress?

15:30.063 --> 15:33.900
-Me? An actress?
-Yeah.

15:33.967 --> 15:39.973
-I can't act.
-Oh, anyone can act. If I
can act, you can act.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.042
Amen.

15:42.109 --> 15:46.313
You know, I think those people
over there just finished their
plate of hummus.

15:46.379 --> 15:49.649
You might want to help them
by clearing it.
Thank you.

15:52.952 --> 15:57.824
-So, Isabel Bigelow.
Do you have a job?
-No.

15:57.890 --> 16:03.130
-Are you rich? Because I am.
(LAUGHS)
I'm extremely wealthy.

16:03.196 --> 16:08.635
Which I'm about to prove
to you by taking care of this
bill for

16:08.701 --> 16:13.373
two dollars and 31 cents.

16:13.440 --> 16:16.309
-Wow!
-Yeah. Wow is right.

16:16.376 --> 16:20.280
-I have to remember to get
some money.
-Yeah.

16:20.347 --> 16:22.949
So, do you want to be
rich and famous?

16:25.085 --> 16:31.191
-I just want to be normal.
-Well, acting is
better than normal.

16:31.258 --> 16:36.163
You get to pretend to be
normal. And if you're good,
you become a big star

16:36.229 --> 16:39.166
and guess what happens?
-What?

16:39.232 --> 16:43.070
You snap your fingers and
pretty much anything you want
materializes

16:43.136 --> 16:48.075
Oh no. No no no no. No.
I have that now.
It's what I'm giving up.

16:49.376 --> 16:53.246
Oh, um, it was
lovely to meet you.

16:53.313 --> 16:57.984
You seem very sweet and
unkempt and
troubled.

17:00.453 --> 17:05.892
Hey! Hey hey hey hey.
Those are bad things to say
to a person.

17:05.958 --> 17:10.597
Oh no they aren't. I think the
fact that you're a hopeless
mess is very refreshing.

17:10.663 --> 17:13.599
It moves me.

17:19.005 --> 17:22.474
-Isabel Bigelow.
-Yes?

17:22.541 --> 17:26.913
-I need you.
-What did you say?

17:26.979 --> 17:29.516
-I said I need you.
-You need me.

17:29.582 --> 17:35.322
I need you.
You don't have to
come audition.

17:35.388 --> 17:38.325
Just come and show everyone
what you look like
when you do it.

17:38.391 --> 17:39.426
Like this?

17:40.593 --> 17:42.395
-Uncanny.
-It's identical.

17:42.462 --> 17:43.496
I told you.

17:44.364 --> 17:47.267
(APPLAUSE)

17:48.535 --> 17:51.504
(MORE APPLAUSE)

17:56.075 --> 18:01.414
We would just like you to
read the script. Start on page
13, should be marked there.

18:01.481 --> 18:03.683
-Read it?
-Mm hmm.

18:12.192 --> 18:16.463
-Okay, out loud.
-Yeah, we just want to get an
idea what it could sound like.

18:18.598 --> 18:25.538
-Uh, int honeymoon suite
night, uh, dash night
-That one's not too bright.

18:25.605 --> 18:30.677
Just, uh, just read the
part that says "Samantha."

18:30.743 --> 18:34.647
Um,
"Darrin, I know it's our
honeymoon but there's

18:34.714 --> 18:39.219
"something I have to tell you.
I'm a witch."
I'm not a witch!

18:39.286 --> 18:42.955
-Yeah, exactly.
No, you're giving it up.
-Who told you?

18:43.022 --> 18:46.159
You're about to,
on the next page.

18:46.226 --> 18:49.662
It's Bewitched, the TV show?
We're redoing it.

18:49.729 --> 18:52.432
Oh, I wasn't allowed to watch
Bewitched. I...

18:52.499 --> 18:56.969
(LAUGHING) Who wasn't allowed
to watch Bewitched?
-That's great, Jack!

18:57.036 --> 19:02.575
That's great. Well, I play a
mortal, and I'm in love
with you, and I don't care

19:02.642 --> 19:04.444
that you're a witch.

19:04.511 --> 19:09.616
-You don't care? No?
Is that true?
-Yes, it is. Yeah.

19:09.682 --> 19:12.719
Now go ahead and
read the lines.

19:12.785 --> 19:16.756
I'll read with you, actually.
We'll do it together.
Randall, where are you?

19:16.823 --> 19:21.461
-Yes, thank you.
This will be easy.
-Mm hmm.

19:26.699 --> 19:28.067
-Here?
-Yeah.

19:28.134 --> 19:31.638
"I'm a witch, Darrin. A real
house-haunting,
broomstick-flying,

19:31.704 --> 19:34.774
"cauldron-stirring witch!"

19:34.841 --> 19:38.211
Great. Ok.
You know what, let's
put the script down,

19:38.278 --> 19:40.313
let's put it away and
we'll improvise.

19:40.380 --> 19:45.418
-Jack? That was only one line.
-Mm. Not a big deal.
Go ahead, just set it down.

19:45.485 --> 19:48.154
Randall...

19:48.221 --> 19:52.191
Now, I'm going to ask you
questions, and you just answer
them as if you're a witch.

19:52.259 --> 19:56.263
-Sure.
-Yeah. Uh, were your parents
in the witch business?

19:56.329 --> 20:01.234
-Both of them.
My mother fixed
the 1986 World Series.

20:01.301 --> 20:03.736
-Funny!
-Um, make a note of that.

20:03.803 --> 20:07.374
Do you carry around poison
apples, like in Snow White?

20:07.440 --> 20:12.312
-Oh no, you have to have a
permit for a poison apple.
-Permit? Ok, good to know.

20:12.379 --> 20:14.281
That's good.

20:14.347 --> 20:16.249
Um, oh - what's it like to
date a warlock?

20:16.316 --> 20:21.053
Oh, horrible! They're so
self-centered, not very
bright, and all that

20:21.120 --> 20:26.293
"feel-good-in-the-moment," you
know? Not at all like you.
(GENERAL LAUGHTER)

20:26.359 --> 20:29.429
-What's so funny?
-Nothing, J-Bone.

20:29.496 --> 20:31.798
-Oh, what's your
favorite spell?

20:31.864 --> 20:35.335
Oh no, I don't like to talk
about that because I'm
quitting, and...

20:35.402 --> 20:37.737
No, talking about it
just makes it harder, so...

20:37.804 --> 20:40.540
-Great.
-Are you sure you never saw
Bewitched?

20:40.607 --> 20:44.176
-She's incredibly dialed-in.
-Can I ask a question?

20:44.243 --> 20:46.879
-Sure.
-How much longer do we
have to do this for?

20:46.946 --> 20:51.150
Oh, this? We're almost done
with this. I mean, if you do
the show,

20:51.217 --> 20:52.985
we'll be together forever.

20:53.052 --> 20:55.322
-You and I?
-Would you please do the show,
Isabel?

20:55.388 --> 20:57.324
-What, this show?
-This show.

20:57.390 --> 21:02.295
-The Bewitched show?
-Absolutely. We'll be working
together. We'll be partners.

21:02.362 --> 21:05.197
-Be my TV wife.
-This is very complicated.

21:05.264 --> 21:10.803
-Marry me.
Say yes!
-What are you doing, Isabel?

21:10.870 --> 21:14.040
-Easy answer!
-Yes.

21:14.106 --> 21:18.945
Yes!
Great, thank you!

21:19.011 --> 21:23.650
Ok, let's make the deal.

21:23.716 --> 21:28.421
Once upon a time, there was a
typical American girl...

21:28.488 --> 21:33.726
...who happened to bump into
a typical, red-blooded
American boy.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.962
And she bumped into him...

21:36.729 --> 21:38.598
...and bumped into him.

21:38.665 --> 21:40.733
(DOORBELL)

21:40.800 --> 21:44.337
So they decided they'd better
sit down and talk this over
before they had an accident.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.709
-Hi!
-Hello?

21:49.776 --> 21:52.144
They delivered this while you
were out, and I said I'd
bring it over.

21:52.211 --> 21:56.115
-I'm your neighbor,
Maria Kelly.
-Come in!

21:56.182 --> 22:00.286
-What is all this stuff?
-I just got the most
amazing job.

22:00.353 --> 22:04.190
I'm going to be Samantha on
Bewitched!
They're re-doing it.

22:04.256 --> 22:07.594
-Are you an actress?
-I guess I am.

22:07.660 --> 22:10.797
-Oh, I love that show! Is that
the one about the genie?
-No?

22:10.863 --> 22:14.000
This is so exciting!

22:16.636 --> 22:20.272
Aah! There you are.
Come here. This is you!

22:20.339 --> 22:23.710
Oh, I love this show!
(HUMS THE THEME)

22:23.776 --> 22:29.015
-You know it?
-Watched it every night!
Love the song! Perfect!

22:29.081 --> 22:31.918
There you are! You're great!
Look at the nose!

22:31.984 --> 22:33.453
I hope you can do that.
That's hard.

22:33.520 --> 22:35.221
Oh, that's how I got the job,
wriggling my nose.

22:35.287 --> 22:37.490
-Really?
-Mm hmm, it's easy.

22:37.557 --> 22:40.192
-Who's going to play
your husband?
-Jack Wyatt.

22:40.259 --> 22:43.530
-Oh my God!
-He believes in me, he wants
to be partners with me.

22:43.596 --> 22:47.099
Listen to this,
"Looking forward
to working with you, Isabel.

22:47.166 --> 22:49.702
"As dictated to
Jack's assistant, Randall."

22:49.769 --> 22:52.271
Isn't that amazing?

22:52.338 --> 22:55.642
He's single.
It's in all the tabloids.
His wife dumped him.

22:55.708 --> 22:56.976
-Is that true?
-Yes!

22:57.043 --> 23:01.514
Oh my gosh!
(SQUEALS OF DELIGHT)

23:01.581 --> 23:05.317
-I don't know why we're
doing this, but it's fun!
-I know!

23:05.384 --> 23:08.455
Although, you really shouldn't
get involved with someone
you're working with.

23:08.521 --> 23:11.858
They can destroy your
references. I'm a career
counselor, and...

23:11.924 --> 23:14.427
Well that's the only reason
I took the job.

23:14.494 --> 23:19.832
He is the cutest mess you have
ever seen. He is hopeless.
(DOORBELL)

23:21.901 --> 23:26.973
Oh, gosh, he's beyond mortal.
My father would never approve.

23:28.074 --> 23:29.642
Oh.

23:30.777 --> 23:34.581
-I won't?
-Daddy. Hi.

23:34.647 --> 23:36.549
(WHISPERING) What are you
doing here?

23:36.616 --> 23:42.421
Hello, Isabel.
Love the hat.
And who is this?

23:42.489 --> 23:45.658
This is my father.
This is Maria Kelly,

23:45.725 --> 23:52.098
Woo hoo hoo, how witchy was
that? We talk about your
father and he turns up.

23:52.164 --> 23:56.836
-Maria is my neighbor.
-Nigel Bigelow.
Enchante.

23:56.903 --> 24:00.940
-Oh, ok.
-And what won't I
approve of?

24:01.007 --> 24:04.877
-A man Isabel thinks is cute.
-I'm completely against it.

24:04.944 --> 24:07.113
I'm going to be an actress
in a television series.

24:07.179 --> 24:09.882
She's going to play Samantha
on Bewitched.

24:09.949 --> 24:14.053
Bewitched? That's an insult
to our way of life.

24:14.120 --> 24:17.189
(LAUGHING) Your Dad is a hoot!

24:17.256 --> 24:20.092
I'm just going to go ahead and
take one of these, because
you've got a lot here.

24:20.159 --> 24:23.329
-Oh sure.
-Anyway, if anyone's robbing
my house, let me know,

24:23.395 --> 24:25.932
and I'll do the same for you.
(HUMS THEME)

24:25.998 --> 24:28.134
Oh! And if you get a date that
has a friend,

24:28.200 --> 24:32.739
make sure he's not secretly
married before you call me.
Bye, Nigel!

24:32.805 --> 24:35.007
-Bye, Maria.
-Bye, Maria.

24:35.975 --> 24:38.310
Why can't you be happy for me?

24:38.377 --> 24:42.414
In less than a week I have
become a rich and
famous actress

24:42.481 --> 24:45.552
living in a house
I don't even have
to pay rent for

24:45.618 --> 24:47.654
just like every other person
in the world.

24:47.720 --> 24:51.423
Why wouldn't I be happy?
You've turned your back
on your own kind,

24:51.490 --> 24:54.894
and now you live
down the street
from a Denny's.

24:54.961 --> 25:00.833
-Don't make fun of my life.
I could make fun of your life.
-So, what about this man?

25:00.900 --> 25:04.003
No, I am not telling you
anything anymore,
you're too negative.

25:04.070 --> 25:07.039
One morning,
I shot a lion in my pajamas.

25:07.106 --> 25:10.743
Now, what he was doing
in my pajamas,
I'll never know.

25:13.980 --> 25:16.115
Uncle Arthur. Classic.

25:16.182 --> 25:19.318
Your brand of low comedy
always did appeal
to adolescent mentality.

25:23.990 --> 25:27.660
-I won't do it.
-Speaking of traveling,
Darrin, remember that time...

25:27.727 --> 25:31.097
-Maybe I will.
-Maybe I will.

25:31.163 --> 25:36.669
...sent over from Europe. It's
simply gorgeous. It reminds me
of the one in California.

25:39.739 --> 25:43.242
(SNEEZES)
-Lucinda, you really should be
watching this.

25:49.682 --> 25:54.854
I'm only trying to say that
you broke your promise. You
gave me your word, no more...

25:54.921 --> 25:59.258
Stuff.
It's a little harder to break
the habit than I thought.

25:59.325 --> 26:05.431
-Well you can do it. I've got
a lot of faith in you.
-Aw, thank you, darling.

26:05.497 --> 26:11.671
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome the star of the new
Bewitched, Jack Wyatt!

26:17.443 --> 26:21.848
Hey, I didn't expect you guys
to be here!
(LAUGHTER)

26:21.914 --> 26:26.886
Okay, as you know, we're here
for Bewitched. But of course
it's not the same Bewitched

26:26.953 --> 26:29.221
that you remember.
It's being retooled.

26:29.288 --> 26:32.024
-But there is going to be a
Samantha, isn't there?
-Of course.

26:32.091 --> 26:37.029
-Isabel, can you come
out here?
(APPLAUSE)

26:38.230 --> 26:40.867
Be brave.
You look beautiful.

26:40.933 --> 26:45.104
Ladies and gentlemen of the
press, I'd like you to meet
the talented and delightful

26:45.171 --> 26:49.375
Ms. Isabel Bigelow.
Say hello to the people,
Isabel.

26:49.441 --> 26:54.146
-Hello!
-No, no, into the microphone.
Here. Here.

26:54.213 --> 26:58.985
-Hello!
-That's enough.
Now do that thing that you do.

27:01.688 --> 27:06.993
(APPLAUSE)
-Great! Just stand there.

27:08.560 --> 27:11.964
And guess who's playing
Endora.

27:12.031 --> 27:17.569
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome the great,
the legendary

27:17.636 --> 27:22.809
Miss Iris Smythson,
as my mother-in-law.
(APPLAUSE)

27:22.875 --> 27:25.344
Iris Smythson. Iris?
Iris?

27:36.622 --> 27:39.025
Ok, yeah.

27:42.261 --> 27:46.766
Iris Smythson.
And of course she hates me.
Don't you?

27:46.833 --> 27:52.071
-Anything you say, Jerry.
-Jack. See what I mean?
That's a joke, right?

27:52.138 --> 27:57.076
-Endora used to refer to
Darrin as Derwood.
-No, I just forgot your name.

27:57.143 --> 28:02.381
But the news here isn't Iris
Smythson, or Jack Wyatt,
who's trying the small screen

28:02.448 --> 28:08.054
after the twin disasters of
his last movie, and a messy
split from his wife, Sheila

28:08.120 --> 28:13.559
who's already found someone
new after a marriage that
lasted only 19 months.

28:13.625 --> 28:18.831
-Didn't she leave him for a
snowboarder/underwear model?
-He's a moron/idiot.

28:18.898 --> 28:21.100
-That's right.
-Aren't they living together?

28:21.167 --> 28:25.104
Yes, in my house!
My house that I bought
before I even met her.

28:25.171 --> 28:27.673
But she won't move
or sign the divorce papers.

28:27.740 --> 28:31.778
The big news is
the surprise casting
of an unknown as Samantha.

28:31.844 --> 28:38.484
Her name is Isabel Bigelow
and she's quite the charmer,
isn't she? That's magic.

28:38.550 --> 28:40.186
So, what's Jack Wyatt
thinking?

28:40.252 --> 28:43.555
"My career has tanked, so I'll
fix it by playing Darrin"?

28:43.622 --> 28:48.027
-Yeah. Because that's crazy.
Who's running his life?
-Plus, he did not look well.

28:48.094 --> 28:52.531
Not look well? I look fine.
I'm extremely healthy.

28:52.598 --> 28:59.138
Oh, Richie. Richie.
What am I going to
do with you?

29:00.773 --> 29:03.109
(RINGING)
-This is Richie.

29:03.175 --> 29:06.478
Richie. Why'd you talk me
into doing this show? Huh?

29:06.545 --> 29:09.015
What was I thinking?
What were you thinking?

29:09.081 --> 29:12.118
We were both thinking
the same thing, Jackattack.
Cast a nobody.

29:12.184 --> 29:14.286
You're completely safe.

29:14.353 --> 29:17.156
Richie, can't you come over
here? I really could use a
little support on this one.

29:17.223 --> 29:21.227
Jack, I can't because I'm
about to step into a meeting
with the head of NBC.

29:21.293 --> 29:22.962
(SHOUTING)
I'll be right there!
One second!

29:23.029 --> 29:26.933
Look, I don't know
if you know this,
but I'm Darrin, okay?

29:26.999 --> 29:31.838
They replaced Darrin on
the original Bewitched
and no one noticed!

29:31.904 --> 29:34.473
Nobody is going to
replace you.

29:34.540 --> 29:37.877
I'm Darrin!
How did this happen?

30:13.579 --> 30:15.647
Hold the work!

30:15.714 --> 30:19.351
Once upon a time,
there was a typical
red-blooded American boy

30:19.418 --> 30:23.355
who happened to bump into
a typical American girl.

30:23.422 --> 30:25.424
(LAUGHTER)

30:25.491 --> 30:27.026
And cut!

30:28.928 --> 30:32.631
-Jack, Jack.
-How was I? How was I?

30:32.698 --> 30:35.567
-That was so good!
-Don't lie to me.

30:36.235 --> 30:38.537
My ribs hurt.

30:38.604 --> 30:41.640
-Jack? Uno mas? From the top?
-One more?

30:43.075 --> 30:46.412
-Did you see what happened?
Good stuff.

30:47.947 --> 30:50.082
Moving on!

30:50.149 --> 30:56.488
-You know it, dude. Nice one.
JACK: Here we go. Off to a
good start, huh?

30:56.555 --> 31:01.260
And after a while, he did
what any red-blooded
American boy would do.

31:01.327 --> 31:05.264
-Samantha, will you marry me?
-Cut!

31:05.331 --> 31:08.434
Great! Beautiful.
That was good.

31:09.801 --> 31:11.837
-Action.
-You're a witch?

31:11.904 --> 31:15.241
And you waited
until our wedding night
to tell me?

31:15.307 --> 31:18.044
I don't believe this!
Oh, golly!

31:18.110 --> 31:20.612
(LAUGHTER)

31:25.151 --> 31:26.152
Samantha.

31:35.327 --> 31:38.864
-Cut! Cut!
-Joey, for God's sake.

31:38.931 --> 31:42.568
Are you trying to kill
everyone?
Because we can't breathe.

31:42.634 --> 31:46.572
Iris, you can't nod to the
audience in the middle of
the show.

31:46.638 --> 31:48.907
-It just breaks the reality.
-What?

31:48.975 --> 31:51.377
-You can't nod to them.
You can't do a little...
-Go sit!

31:51.443 --> 31:54.313
-In your chair.
Back to your chair.
-All right, but...

31:55.747 --> 31:58.717
-Take two up. Rolling!
-You're a witch?

31:58.784 --> 32:04.856
And you waited until
our wedding night to tell me?
I can't believe this.

32:08.961 --> 32:10.462
What's going on?

32:12.598 --> 32:15.634
Samantha.

32:21.273 --> 32:23.242
Why is she waving?

32:23.309 --> 32:29.381
-Who are you?
-I am Samantha's mother,
Endora.

32:29.448 --> 32:32.884
A mortal?
You married a mortal?
Oh, my poor, poor baby.

32:32.951 --> 32:36.955
-This is just horrifying.
-I think I need a drink.

32:37.023 --> 32:39.158
Freeze!

32:42.461 --> 32:43.629
Unfreeze!

32:44.330 --> 32:45.331
Aaah!

32:48.367 --> 32:50.802
What a shame
you didn't drink it.
If you had,

32:50.869 --> 32:56.408
perhaps you could've spent
your wedding night
as a bullfrog.

32:58.044 --> 33:02.381
Don't worry, Samantha.
I won't do it.
Witch's honor.

33:07.253 --> 33:13.559
My darling,
we are quicksilver.
We're a fleeting shadow.

33:13.625 --> 33:16.328
-We're a distant sound.
-That's your mother?

33:16.395 --> 33:20.066
We live on the wind,
in the sparkle of a star.

33:22.301 --> 33:25.104
And you want to trade all that
for an acre of crabgrass?

33:25.171 --> 33:29.308
-Did she just call me
an acre of crabgrass?
-Deal with it, Derwood.

33:32.778 --> 33:36.182
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!

33:39.551 --> 33:44.356
I want a piece of the show.
Why? Because I put this thing
together, that's why.

33:44.423 --> 33:47.959
Because Jack Wyatt
doesn't parallel park
without checking with me.

33:48.026 --> 33:52.264
Let me call you back. J-Bone!
You're crushing it, baby.
Absolutely crushing it.

33:52.331 --> 33:54.266
-I think we got something.
-It's exciting.

33:54.333 --> 33:57.369
-How's Isabel doing?
-She's perfect. She looks hot

33:57.436 --> 33:59.471
and she lets you score
like a madman.

33:59.538 --> 34:02.841
-I know. She's great.
-I can't believe you
found her, baby.

34:02.908 --> 34:04.510
You think she's going to
notice?

34:04.576 --> 34:07.146
What? That she doesn't
have a part?
Not a chance. She's clueless.

34:07.213 --> 34:12.650
Plus, I think she's got
a little thing for you.
It's freaking pathetic.

34:12.717 --> 34:14.920
-You think so?
-Yes.

34:14.985 --> 34:19.158
-Man, that would be...
-Such a nightmare. I know.
Can you imagine?

34:19.225 --> 34:23.661
Although, she does have
kind of a cute little
back end on her.

34:23.728 --> 34:26.132
I mean, I wouldn't kick her
out of bed for eating
a box of crackers.

34:26.197 --> 34:27.966
Isabel?

34:30.436 --> 34:32.504
-Did she hear us?
-Not a chance.

34:32.571 --> 34:34.239
A couple of changes
to the script.

34:34.306 --> 34:38.277
It was running a little long,
so we cut your lines.

34:39.511 --> 34:42.013
Think of it this way,
it's less to memorize.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.516
(NERVOUS LAUGH)
Sorry.

34:47.619 --> 34:48.987
Lunch!

35:02.734 --> 35:04.836
Isabel!

35:04.903 --> 35:09.375
I feel like a fool. A big,
stupid, sad fool, and yet I'm
angry as well.

35:09.441 --> 35:13.445
-What's going on?
-Let's set fire to his
trailer. Let's just do it.

35:13.512 --> 35:17.249
Isabel, this is awesome!
You're on TV.

35:17.316 --> 35:21.520
He lied to me.
He tricked me.
He said he needed me.

35:21.587 --> 35:24.356
When all he needed was someone
to stand next to him

35:24.423 --> 35:28.093
while he says
his stupid clever lines.

35:31.297 --> 35:32.998
-Hi, I'm Maria.
-Nina.

35:35.867 --> 35:40.639
He seemed so messy and
sincere. But really,
he's just a big fake.

35:40.706 --> 35:44.109
We could electrocute him.
There's tons of wires
around here.

35:44.176 --> 35:48.880
I want to cry.
I want to break things.
I want to hurt him.

35:48.947 --> 35:52.751
Yet there's a part of me that
still has a small amount
of feeling for him.

35:52.818 --> 35:56.087
-How can this be?
-When my first husband left
me, I wanted to

35:56.154 --> 35:59.291
cut the brake cables in his
car, but instead we ended up

35:59.358 --> 36:01.693
having sex on
the elliptical machine.

36:01.760 --> 36:06.432
He doesn't understand who
he's dealing with.
He has no idea.

36:06.498 --> 36:10.068
Look, you have three options.
You put up with it,

36:10.135 --> 36:13.672
quit, or get mad.

36:15.607 --> 36:17.776
What would Samantha do?

36:30.722 --> 36:32.658
She chose mad, right?

36:47.973 --> 36:49.140
Aaah!

36:56.348 --> 37:01.587
Okay, everybody, settle down.
Okay, working very quietly,
like little mice.

37:01.653 --> 37:05.857
I don't want to see or hear
what you're doing.

37:05.924 --> 37:10.796
Okay, so, Isabel, just to
refresh your memory,
Darrin's ex-girlfriend...

37:10.862 --> 37:15.033
-I read the script.
-Okay. Well, let's just go
over it one more time.

37:15.100 --> 37:19.104
-Oh, and we rehearsed it
a lot.
-Well, I'm aware of that.

37:19.170 --> 37:23.275
Darrin's ex-girlfriend has
invited you both
over for dinner.

37:23.342 --> 37:25.877
And Darrin forced you
to come with him...

37:25.944 --> 37:28.880
He tricked me. Because he is
a self-centered has-been.

37:28.947 --> 37:31.750
No, no, baby,
that's not it. No.

37:31.817 --> 37:35.887
Because he wants his dog back,
and then Darrin says his line:

37:35.954 --> 37:38.857
(TOGETHER)
"It's my dog.
I want him back."

37:38.924 --> 37:42.794
(LAUGHTER)
It always kills me, Jack.
You ready to go?

37:42.861 --> 37:45.397
-Let's do it. Let's do it.
-All right then. Saddle up.
Rolling!

37:51.236 --> 37:52.671
Action!

37:52.738 --> 37:56.207
(DRAMATICALLY) It's my dog.
My dog!

37:56.274 --> 37:58.677
And I will die if I do
not have him back.

37:58.744 --> 38:02.748
Do you understand?
I will die

38:02.814 --> 38:07.419
if I do not have him back!

38:08.286 --> 38:10.088
Cut!

38:10.155 --> 38:14.693
Well, that was a bit much,
Jack. You want to take it down
a notch?

38:14.760 --> 38:16.895
Or five?

38:16.962 --> 38:19.365
You know what? Just keep it
going. Let me just go right
away. I'll get it this time

38:19.431 --> 38:20.432
Rolling!

38:21.733 --> 38:23.034
Action!

38:23.101 --> 38:28.640
Where art thou, dog?
Thy canine lover.

38:28.707 --> 38:30.208
What's happening?

38:30.275 --> 38:34.346
Where is your hot breath
upon the nape of my neck?

38:34.413 --> 38:37.983
We shall form a bond of
brotherhood, man and beast.

38:38.049 --> 38:42.488
-You shall lick my face
and I shall lick your snout.
-Cut! Jack?

38:42.554 --> 38:47.459
-Guys, I'm not doing this
on purpose, I swear to you.
-Okay. All right.

38:47.526 --> 38:48.760
Rolling.

38:48.827 --> 38:53.098
Esta mi perro.

38:53.164 --> 38:55.434
Mi perro es mi corazon.

38:55.501 --> 39:00.606
Muchos taquitos
esbuena suerte.

39:00.672 --> 39:08.213
Oh my God! Where's my dog?
Totally. I have a totally
great dog.

39:08.279 --> 39:12.818
(SCREAMS INCOMPREHENSIBLY)

39:12.884 --> 39:14.920
Jack. Jack.
What are you doing?

39:16.622 --> 39:22.093
This is where the dog has to
decide between Darrin's ex
and Darrin.

39:22.160 --> 39:28.366
Samantha wiggles her nose
and the dog chooses Darrin.
Rolling!

39:28.434 --> 39:31.803
I know how we can
solve this, Darrin.
We'll let Satchel decide.

39:31.870 --> 39:36.842
That's a great idea.
Come to Daddy, Satchel.
Look! Good boy.

39:36.908 --> 39:39.945
-Come to Mommy. Good boy!
-Satchel...

39:40.011 --> 39:43.949
-Okay, Isabel,
wiggle your nose.
-Satchel. Come to Mommy.

39:44.015 --> 39:48.253
-Come on. Come on. Up!
Right here!
-Come to Mommy, Satchel.

39:48.319 --> 39:51.723
-Come to Daddy.
-I got it, Jack. I got it.

39:51.790 --> 39:53.725
Don't you dare go to Daddy.
Come to Mommy!

39:53.792 --> 39:56.828
No, no, no. You love Daddy.
Come on, Satchel.

40:00.699 --> 40:04.603
-He's coming. He's coming.
-He's just sitting there.

40:09.007 --> 40:11.710
(APPLAUSE)
Cut!

40:11.777 --> 40:14.613
-Jim, what's going on here?
-Joey!

40:16.448 --> 40:19.451
If the dog runs to you again,
try this.

40:22.454 --> 40:25.724
-Come to Daddy, Satchel.
-Satchel, come to Mommy.

40:25.791 --> 40:29.495
-Come on! Come on, Satchel.
-Come on, boy, please?

40:30.662 --> 40:32.330
Good girl.

40:36.568 --> 40:38.537
Thank God you didn't have
a great dane!

40:38.604 --> 40:41.740
(LAUGHTER AND
APPLAUSE)

40:41.807 --> 40:43.441
Damn it!

40:45.043 --> 40:46.712
Cut!

40:49.280 --> 40:54.219
Darling, that was marvelous.
But, watch out for that.

40:54.285 --> 40:57.889
Please don't say anything.

40:57.956 --> 41:00.492
Calm down, you're not alone.

41:00.559 --> 41:04.930
I'm not? Are there others?

41:04.996 --> 41:10.569
There are many others.
Many actors, they develop

41:10.636 --> 41:13.939
tricks, twitches, really.

41:14.005 --> 41:18.644
-You don't want to
become mannered.
-Oh, no, I don't.

41:19.578 --> 41:21.813
Thank you, Iris.

41:39.731 --> 41:42.167
-Hello.
-Daddy, what...?

41:42.233 --> 41:46.972
Well, if it isn't my spell-
casting magical daughter who
gave up witchcraft.

41:47.038 --> 41:49.174
You've had quite a day today,
haven't you?

41:49.240 --> 41:52.477
I was provoked. I fell off the
wagon. It was a one-time
thing.

41:59.685 --> 42:01.553
So you're not in love
with him anymore?

42:01.620 --> 42:04.089
I have never disliked a man
more in my entire life,

42:04.155 --> 42:06.391
which proves that I am
completely over him.

42:06.457 --> 42:08.660
Not necessarily. In fact...

42:08.727 --> 42:12.363
Besides, it was just a crush,
which is an intense but
superficial attraction

42:12.430 --> 42:16.434
that can easily be mistaken
for something deeper.
Now go away.

42:20.138 --> 42:23.541
-I have a crush on Endora.
-What?

42:29.047 --> 42:31.082
Daddy, where are you?

42:32.751 --> 42:36.855
I said, I have a crush
on Endora.

42:36.922 --> 42:39.457
-Daddy. No.
-So lovely.

42:39.524 --> 42:44.395
-Her name is not Endora.
It's Iris.
-Iris. A spring flower.

42:44.462 --> 42:49.635
You can't. Now that I turned
out to be so wrong about him,
my job is all that I've got.

42:49.701 --> 42:52.203
-Please don't mess it up.
-How could I do that?

42:52.270 --> 42:56.975
How? You'll sleep with her,
cheat on her, she'll go crazy
and she'll take it out on me.

42:57.042 --> 43:00.779
I don't want you to
get involved with Iris.
I mean it.

43:00.846 --> 43:05.250
-You can't stop being a witch.
-I can, too. You'll see.

43:05.316 --> 43:07.719
-Cannot.
-Can too.

43:07.786 --> 43:11.422
-Just accept it.
-Never.

43:11.489 --> 43:14.860
-Tell me about Bewitched.
Some have said it's a crass
attempt by the network

43:14.926 --> 43:18.930
to market nostalgia rather
than take a risk on new ideas.

43:18.997 --> 43:23.769
This isn't the old Bewitched.
It's been refocused.
Let's just say the only thing

43:23.835 --> 43:26.437
I won't be doing is this...

43:31.142 --> 43:36.181
So you leave the nose-wiggling
to the witch.
But you do it so well.

43:36.247 --> 43:38.784
Well, I don't know about that.
I did coach her, though.

43:38.850 --> 43:43.521
-Can we get a close-up
on the nose?
-I'd rather not.

43:43.588 --> 43:46.792
Which camera?
Here? Okay.

43:47.793 --> 43:50.328
(PHONE RINGS)

43:50.395 --> 43:52.764
Shall we discuss,
dare we discuss,

43:52.831 --> 43:55.100
-Hello?
-Last Year in Katmandu?

43:55.166 --> 44:00.538
Hi, Nina.
Yes, yes I'm watching him.

44:00.605 --> 44:02.974
What's a dick?

44:03.041 --> 44:05.576
...no one ever sets out
to make a bad movie...

44:05.643 --> 44:10.682
Oh. What does that have to do
with how obnoxious
he is being?

44:10.749 --> 44:12.684
...Some movies are
career-enders...

44:12.751 --> 44:15.353
Right. Right, we need a plan.

44:15.420 --> 44:19.224
-What went wrong?
-You know, I hate to
point fingers,

44:19.290 --> 44:23.661
but I'm going to blame
the wardrobe department.
-The wardrobe department?

44:23.729 --> 44:25.063
I think it got in the way.

44:25.130 --> 44:28.466
-Maybe I should quit.
-Honey, you can't quit.

44:28.533 --> 44:32.904
-Why not?
Isn't that what people do?
-He has to quit, not you.

44:32.971 --> 44:34.906
-Yeah, right, like that's ever
going to happen.

44:34.973 --> 44:39.110
We have to make him quit. If
we get naked pictures of him
and pictures of farm animals

44:39.177 --> 44:42.147
I could just Photoshop them.
-That's an excellent idea.

44:42.213 --> 44:44.582
No, no, no. Wait.
Calm down. Calm down.

44:44.649 --> 44:49.220
No, no, no, this is not
what I wanted.
I wanted something normal.

44:49.287 --> 44:52.223
What should I do?

44:59.765 --> 45:01.032
(THUMP)

45:04.702 --> 45:06.104
(THUMP)

45:11.676 --> 45:17.715
Oh, my.
Ooh, what a mess.

45:17.783 --> 45:21.419
Your Aunt Clara used to be
able to make
a clean landing.

45:21.486 --> 45:25.991
Aunt Clara?

45:26.057 --> 45:31.396
Oh, Aunt Clara. Oh, thank
goodness you're here.

45:31.462 --> 45:36.067
I am in the middle of a total,
total crisis at work.
I'm quitting.

45:36.134 --> 45:40.571
No, you mustn't quit.
The show must go on.
-Isabel, are you all right?

45:40.638 --> 45:46.544
-My friends. I have friends.
They don't know we're witches.
-Mum's the word.

45:46.611 --> 45:49.747
You know, there was
an Aunt Clara on
the original Bewitched.

45:49.815 --> 45:53.551
-What a coincidence!
-She was a witch.

45:53.618 --> 45:57.555
So am I.

45:57.622 --> 46:01.326
She was always screwing up.

46:01.392 --> 46:05.296
-Really?
-I have made up my mind.
I'm quitting tomorrow,

46:05.363 --> 46:10.101
and I'll do something else,
like sailing or
polishing fruit.

46:10.168 --> 46:13.171
It's too bad you're not a
witch. You could put a hex
on Jack.

46:13.238 --> 46:16.774
Oh, I can. I certainly can.
Who is Jack?

46:16.842 --> 46:19.477
The reason I'm quitting.

46:19.544 --> 46:24.315
-Well, why not put a hex
on him.
-Because I'm giving it up.

46:24.382 --> 46:26.151
-Just a little one.
-Aunt Clara.

46:26.217 --> 46:30.088
Just to get him to behave.
I'll do it.

46:32.223 --> 46:35.760
And then I can keep my job.
Which would help
my self-esteem.

46:35.827 --> 46:40.165
You know, there's only one
problem with a hex. There's no
such thing as magic.

46:40.231 --> 46:44.769
So, what's your idea,
Little Miss Doubtful?

46:44.836 --> 46:46.872
-Well, I have a Taser.
-Nina.

46:46.938 --> 46:51.977
No, I think we should Taser
him and throw him into the
shark tank at SeaWorld.

46:52.043 --> 47:02.520
-No. You think we should
do a hex.
-I think we should do a hex.

47:02.587 --> 47:08.459
* ...witchy woman,
see how high
she flies... *

47:08.526 --> 47:13.098
A pinch of jasmine, wolfbane,

47:13.164 --> 47:16.834
-Grapefruit pith.
-Grapefruit pith.

47:16.902 --> 47:21.973
I feel so alive. I feel like
one of those people
I'd make fun of.

47:22.040 --> 47:25.043
I feel like I believe
in unicorns.

47:25.110 --> 47:28.846
-Did I put in the wolfbane?
I can't remember.
-Aunt Clara.

47:28.914 --> 47:33.351
Thank you, darling. Thank you.
Oh well...

47:53.871 --> 47:57.375
Isabel.

47:57.442 --> 48:04.082
* Isabel, bo-bel,
Banana-fana fo-fel
Fee-fy-fo-fel, Isabel! *

48:04.149 --> 48:06.617
"The Name Game!"

48:06.684 --> 48:09.120
-Oh boy.
-Good morning.

48:09.187 --> 48:13.391
Randall, take that stupid sign
off that machine. Free
cappuccinos for everyone.

48:13.458 --> 48:16.161
Buongiorno, buongiorno.

48:16.227 --> 48:18.729
-How are we all doing?
Has anyone seen Isabel?
-No, why?

48:18.796 --> 48:21.099
-Because I miss her.
-Listen, Jack.

48:21.166 --> 48:25.770
-Yes.
-We got the test scores
from the pilot

48:25.836 --> 48:29.374
How did Isabel do? 99%
percent in the top box!
Why didn't you tell me?

48:29.440 --> 48:33.711
This is great news.
Of course she got a 99%.
Because she's dynamite.

48:33.778 --> 48:38.049
Absolute dynamite.
High-fives all the way around.

48:38.116 --> 48:40.751
-But, Jack, there is a
problem. Your scores...

48:40.818 --> 48:47.192
32%. That's better than zero,
huh? You know what? That's
just constructive criticism.

48:47.258 --> 48:52.530
The dog scored higher than me.
He's a cute dog.
What do the comment cards say?

48:52.597 --> 48:57.435
-Oh, they don't really...
-"Jack Wyatt is a real tool."

48:57.502 --> 49:00.171
But a good tool.
Like a Jacksaw!

49:00.238 --> 49:04.109
You know what? Who cares?
This just means we've got hard
work to do, okay?

49:04.175 --> 49:07.112
Hey, I never said
I was perfect.
The important thing is Isabel.

49:07.178 --> 49:08.813
-Isabel.
-Yeah, no question.

49:10.181 --> 49:14.085
-Good morning, everyone.
-There she is!

49:14.152 --> 49:18.223
Is it just my imagination, or
is the room actually brighter
with her here?

49:18.289 --> 49:21.592
Look at this bundle
of miraculous talent.

49:21.659 --> 49:26.764
Forget 99,
I give her a hundred!

49:27.665 --> 49:29.734
Rehearsing!

49:29.800 --> 49:32.870
"Interior, apartment, day.
Samantha and Darrin
are sitting

49:32.937 --> 49:36.307
"in their overcrowded
apartment."

49:36.374 --> 49:40.211
Darrin, I think we should
buy a house, and I found
one that I love.

49:40.278 --> 49:45.716
You nailed that!
I'm about to have a heart
attack. Isn't she great?

49:45.783 --> 49:48.753
And now I kiss her, because
she's in love with
our new house.

49:48.819 --> 49:51.156
Oh, you can't kiss me.
I'm not in this scene.

49:51.222 --> 49:52.690
-You're not in the scene?
-No.

49:52.757 --> 49:56.394
No, no, no. She isn't in the
scene? This isn't happening!

49:56.461 --> 50:00.598
What? She has to be
in every scene! Okay?

50:00.665 --> 50:05.036
Rewrite! Go! Rewrite.

50:05.103 --> 50:09.974
-Everyone, Isabel needs
a joke.
-I would love a joke.

50:10.041 --> 50:13.811
One joke, coming up.
Oh, and then I kiss her
because she's so funny.

50:13.878 --> 50:17.248
And a job. She needs a job.

50:17.315 --> 50:20.618
Yes! Make her the CEO of a
multinational corporation.

50:20.685 --> 50:23.221
-Good idea, Jack.
-No. Great idea.

50:23.288 --> 50:26.191
And then I kiss her
because she's so powerful.

50:29.627 --> 50:33.198
It's too much. What happened?

50:33.264 --> 50:38.536
Aunt Clara. Aunt Clara? Please
pick up the phone, something
terrible is happening.

50:38.603 --> 50:41.572
Mm hmm, something terrible
is happening.

50:41.639 --> 50:44.509
I know, I know.
It wasn't supposed to, and...

50:44.575 --> 50:46.544
You should never, ever
get involved with an actor.

50:46.611 --> 50:49.214
I'm not involved with him,
I don't think.

50:49.280 --> 50:52.717
-Witch's honor?
-What?

50:52.783 --> 50:55.553
I'm just being Endora.

50:55.620 --> 51:00.057
Isabel, actors look normal,
sometimes better than normal,

51:00.125 --> 51:03.494
But deep down,
there is no deep down.

51:03.561 --> 51:07.064
Now, I thought you were safe.
He loathed you.
What on Earth happened?

51:07.132 --> 51:09.400
A little witchcraft,
I suspect.

51:09.467 --> 51:12.937
Even though we weren't going
to do it, were we, darling?

51:13.003 --> 51:14.505
I'm Nigel Bigelow. I'm...

51:14.572 --> 51:17.242
-Isabel's father.
How do you do?
-Oh, daddy...

51:17.308 --> 51:19.277
We talked about this,
remember?

51:19.344 --> 51:21.846
-I'm...
-I know who you are.

51:21.912 --> 51:23.948
I've seen everything
you've ever done.

51:24.014 --> 51:25.883
Lysistrata in Florence,

51:25.950 --> 51:29.053
Blithe Spirit in New York.
You're Endora.

51:29.120 --> 51:30.488
It's a marvel.

51:30.555 --> 51:33.191
-It comes so easily, really.
-Really?
-Oh, yes...

51:33.258 --> 51:35.059
Because I am a witch.

51:35.126 --> 51:38.163
-Really?
-Oh, yes. I put out
all the lights

51:38.229 --> 51:40.565
in Leicester Square,
just by walking past.

51:40.631 --> 51:42.533
-Tell me more.
Tell me everything!
-(LAUGHING)

51:42.600 --> 51:44.235
Oh please, come in!

51:44.302 --> 51:45.670
-(GIGGLING)
-NIGEL: Ciao.

51:48.173 --> 51:50.107
This is just fine...

51:50.175 --> 51:51.376
MAN: Isabel!

51:51.942 --> 51:52.977
Hey!

51:53.043 --> 51:54.078
Isabel!

51:54.145 --> 51:55.246
Isabel.

51:55.313 --> 51:57.114
Hey... Hi!

51:57.182 --> 52:00.017
Listen. Maybe we could
go to dinner tonight.
God, I'm so nervous.

52:00.084 --> 52:02.820
-I don't think so.
I have to get home.
-We won't make it a date.

52:02.887 --> 52:05.756
I'll just happen to stop by
your place and ask you
if you're hungry.

52:05.823 --> 52:07.358
-No.
-Yes! That's a yes.

52:07.425 --> 52:09.894
-No!
-I'll be by at great.
I mean...

52:09.960 --> 52:11.396
I'll be by at eight!

52:11.462 --> 52:13.431
Stop by if you need anything.
I'm right here.

52:13.498 --> 52:14.699
Okay...
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

52:18.769 --> 52:20.738
Aunt Clara!

52:20.805 --> 52:21.839
Undo it!

52:21.906 --> 52:23.674
Undo it! You overdid it.
Undo it!

52:23.741 --> 52:25.176
Oh dear...

52:25.243 --> 52:27.978
-Aunt Clara!
-I'm not too sure
how to undo it!

52:28.045 --> 52:30.681
Undoing it's not the same
as doing it.

52:30.748 --> 52:32.883
He wants to have dinner.

52:32.950 --> 52:36.053
-This isn't what I wanted.
-Lorna Doone?

52:36.120 --> 52:37.522
No! No...

52:37.588 --> 52:41.659
Darling, I'm sure you can undo
the hex if you really want to.

52:41.726 --> 52:43.894
-Huh?
-I'm expected in Japan.

52:46.731 --> 52:48.699
Well, that certainly didn't
work, did it?

52:52.470 --> 52:54.272
Aunt Clara?

52:54.339 --> 52:57.408
Aunt Clara, come back here
right now.

52:57.475 --> 53:00.345
He's gonna be here any minute.
Aunt Clara!

53:00.411 --> 53:03.047
But that doesn't matter
because I'm not going
out with him.

53:03.113 --> 53:05.115
No, no I'm not.
I'm not!

53:11.088 --> 53:12.923
Who cares what I look like?

53:12.990 --> 53:14.492
I'm just gonna undo the hex.

53:14.559 --> 53:16.827
I'm not even gonna bother
dressing up.

53:22.032 --> 53:23.568
(DOORBELL RINGS)

53:30.641 --> 53:35.880
I'm just gonna open the door,
undo it and slam the door
in his face.

53:35.946 --> 53:39.016
Hey, I just happened to be
in the neighborhood with
these roses

53:39.083 --> 53:42.620
and a Cat Steven's CD
and this bracelet

53:42.687 --> 53:44.489
and I thought I'd stop by.

53:44.555 --> 53:46.957
-You're sweating.
-Like a pig.

53:47.825 --> 53:49.427
How divine.

53:52.797 --> 53:54.164
Oh! (GIGGLES)

53:54.231 --> 53:55.666
You look stunning.

53:55.733 --> 53:58.202
No! Ravishing.

53:58.269 --> 54:00.037
You look...stunnishing!

54:03.608 --> 54:05.009
Is this your purse?

54:08.746 --> 54:10.281
You're not too cold, are you?

54:10.348 --> 54:11.616
-No.
-Not too warm?

54:11.682 --> 54:13.718
-Mmm-Mmm.
-Okay...

54:13.784 --> 54:16.053
-Are we going somewhere?
-Dinner.

54:21.058 --> 54:23.260
I wanna know everything.

54:23.328 --> 54:25.396
You talk, okay?

54:25.463 --> 54:27.197
I'm just gonna listen.

54:27.264 --> 54:30.701
Shed your radiance
and I'll just soak it up
like a plant.

54:31.736 --> 54:34.004
Start in kindergarten.

54:34.071 --> 54:35.540
I didn't go to kindergarten.

54:35.606 --> 54:38.142
-I was home schooled.
-You were home schooled?

54:38.208 --> 54:40.110
So was I.

54:40.177 --> 54:42.680
How amazing! That's freaky.

54:42.747 --> 54:46.116
-I'm getting chills.
-Yeah, that is kind of
amazing.

54:46.183 --> 54:47.552
My parents were hippies,
were yours?

54:47.618 --> 54:50.488
-No.
-That's so weird.

54:50.555 --> 54:53.791
My parents were hippies
and yours weren't.
What are the odds?

54:53.858 --> 54:55.660
Though we did have incense
and candles.

54:55.726 --> 54:57.294
-So did we!
-You did?

54:57.362 --> 54:59.163
To this day, the smell
of incense makes me puke.

54:59.229 --> 55:01.632
-Yes! Me too.
-Amazing!

55:01.699 --> 55:03.668
-Wow.
-I brought duck.

55:03.734 --> 55:05.169
Oh! I...

55:05.235 --> 55:07.004
-I love duck.
-So do I!

55:07.071 --> 55:08.606
How amazing is that?

55:08.673 --> 55:10.375
Well, most people love duck.

55:10.441 --> 55:12.042
You know what?
No, they don't.

55:12.109 --> 55:13.177
Wait!

55:13.243 --> 55:14.945
-I wrote you a song.
-Oh...

55:15.012 --> 55:17.314
-No one's ever written me
a song.
-Well...

55:17.382 --> 55:18.416
I did.

55:20.551 --> 55:22.252
* Hey...

55:22.319 --> 55:25.155
* pretty lady

55:25.222 --> 55:28.459
* I'm back here with my heart

55:29.527 --> 55:31.161
* Hey...

55:31.228 --> 55:33.063
* pretty lady

55:34.064 --> 55:37.468
* Are you a dream, made real?

55:37.535 --> 55:41.639
* My soul, you have healed

55:41.706 --> 55:45.142
* Make me a better man

55:45.209 --> 55:49.447
* I wanna set up residence

55:49.514 --> 55:53.418
* In your promised land

55:53.484 --> 55:55.052
Okay, and this is the...

55:55.119 --> 55:56.487
power-ballad guitar-solo.

55:56.554 --> 55:58.489
(VOCALIZING)

56:02.727 --> 56:03.761
* Promise land!

56:03.828 --> 56:04.862
Now, you sing the chorus.

56:06.831 --> 56:08.365
* -Promised land
-Yeah. *

56:10.034 --> 56:12.169
Drum solo.
(VOCALIZING)

56:13.804 --> 56:15.906
* -Promised land
-Promised land
-Leg kick. *

56:15.973 --> 56:17.207
-Whoo!
-Whoo!

56:17.274 --> 56:18.976
Okay, I'm gonna
break the guitar.

56:19.043 --> 56:21.278
* Promised land!
Whoo!

56:25.683 --> 56:27.351
JACK: * Promised land

56:29.119 --> 56:30.254
Whoo!

56:37.762 --> 56:39.363
We're about to kiss,
aren't we?

56:39.430 --> 56:42.600
I thought so, but thanks for
ruining the moment,
Miss Narrator.

56:46.070 --> 56:47.738
Oh, my ruby jewel.

56:50.074 --> 56:53.343
-What?
-My chocolate-covered
strawberry.

56:53.410 --> 56:55.546
I wanna bask in
our love like...

56:55.613 --> 56:57.281
like a house-cat,

56:57.347 --> 56:58.983
lying in the sun.

56:59.049 --> 57:01.486
-Meow. Meow.
-Jack, Jack... Stop.

57:01.552 --> 57:02.853
I forgot I...

57:02.920 --> 57:05.490
Why did I let myself forget?
It was...

57:05.556 --> 57:08.025
It was so nice,
I couldn't help myself and...

57:08.092 --> 57:09.927
Oh, Jack!

57:09.994 --> 57:12.697
This is sad.
This is... No.

57:12.763 --> 57:14.431
Let's make love
in a hot-air balloon.

57:14.499 --> 57:17.401
-Uh...
-Let's make love
in a candy factory.

57:17.468 --> 57:19.737
-Huh?
-Let's make love
in a petting zoo.

57:19.804 --> 57:21.606
-I have to undo this. I do.
-Let's make love

57:21.672 --> 57:24.108
at Sea World
on the back of a killer whale.

57:24.174 --> 57:26.911
Because it doesn't mean
anything unless it's real.

57:37.354 --> 57:43.260
What witches wish, no mortal
needs. Let time repent
and unsow its seeds

57:43.327 --> 57:46.531
And now I speak the ancient
word of redemption

57:46.597 --> 57:48.265
and regret.

57:48.332 --> 57:50.134
Rewind.

58:24.702 --> 58:27.004
MAN: So you leave the
nose-wiggling to the witch.

58:27.071 --> 58:29.039
But you do it so well!

58:29.106 --> 58:31.508
-JACK: I did coach her though.
-MAN: Can we get a close-up

58:31.576 --> 58:32.710
on the nose?

58:32.777 --> 58:34.044
JACK: I'd rather not.

58:34.679 --> 58:35.913
Which camera?

58:35.980 --> 58:37.648
(PHONE RINGS)

58:37.715 --> 58:40.117
Hello, Nina.

58:40.184 --> 58:42.352
I just knew it was you.
That's all.

58:42.419 --> 58:43.621
Yes he is.

58:43.688 --> 58:46.791
He is a giant, male
reproductive organ.

58:46.857 --> 58:49.694
We don't need a plan.
I already know what
I'm gonna do.

58:49.760 --> 58:51.528
I'm gonna speak to him...

58:51.596 --> 58:54.231
about his behavior.
I'm gonna talk to him
sensibly

58:54.298 --> 58:57.201
and directly
and I know he will change.

58:57.267 --> 58:58.936
You'll see.
Bye.

59:03.140 --> 59:05.142
Butt out, Samantha.
I know what I'm doing.

59:09.279 --> 59:10.547
I mean it.

59:12.917 --> 59:14.619
JACK: * Jack-Jack-bo-back

59:14.685 --> 59:16.386
* Banana-fana-fo-fack

59:16.453 --> 59:18.422
* Bee-bi-bo-back

59:18.488 --> 59:19.924
* Jack!

59:20.858 --> 59:22.860
Guys, make me 20 cappuccinos.

59:22.927 --> 59:24.561
Bring me the best one.

59:24.629 --> 59:26.731
-Hey J-Bone.
-Hey, Buddy.

59:26.797 --> 59:28.498
-The test-scores are in.
-How'd I do?

59:28.565 --> 59:30.500
-90? 100? 120?
-Well...

59:30.567 --> 59:33.037
-No...
-140? What does it say?

59:33.103 --> 59:34.438
I got it.
I got it right here.

59:35.472 --> 59:36.807
32.

59:36.874 --> 59:38.142
I got a 32?

59:39.043 --> 59:40.745
Is that for real?

59:40.811 --> 59:41.979
The dogs scored
higher than I did.

59:42.046 --> 59:44.581
Well, it's not you, Jack.

59:44.649 --> 59:45.683
It's Darrin.

59:45.750 --> 59:47.451
"That Jack Wyatt
is a real tool.

59:47.517 --> 59:49.186
"We hate him.

59:49.253 --> 59:51.055
"We mean the actor,
not the character."

59:53.490 --> 59:54.759
Get a grip.

59:56.994 --> 59:58.162
Hug me.

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:06.704
I'm gonna be doing
dinner theater at Boca Raton.

01:00:06.771 --> 01:00:09.039
They hate the show.
The whole show.

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:11.308
They hate everyone on it.

01:00:11.375 --> 01:00:12.743
-Yeah, they did...
-Yep.

01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:14.979
Isabel must have
gotten savaged.

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:17.848
She got 99?

01:00:17.915 --> 01:00:19.549
99? Is that for real?

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:21.085
Is that a joke?

01:00:21.151 --> 01:00:23.453
She didn't say anything!

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:25.823
How is it that someone
who doesn't say anything

01:00:25.890 --> 01:00:28.592
scores higher than someone
who had all the lines?

01:00:28.659 --> 01:00:29.760
Oh my...

01:00:29.827 --> 01:00:32.129
Did anyone anticipate
this as a possibility?

01:00:32.196 --> 01:00:33.397
Hindsight's 20/20.

01:00:34.298 --> 01:00:35.432
Good morning, everyone.

01:00:35.499 --> 01:00:36.767
And they think I'm a tool?

01:00:36.834 --> 01:00:39.336
I haven't been called a tool
since I was 15.

01:00:39.403 --> 01:00:40.871
Thank you, guys.

01:00:40.938 --> 01:00:42.339
Thank you!

01:00:42.406 --> 01:00:45.442
You know what? No one
ever liked Darrin!

01:00:45.509 --> 01:00:48.445
No one! Why did we ever
think that was gonna change?

01:00:48.512 --> 01:00:49.579
I have something to say.

01:00:49.646 --> 01:00:51.782
This is unbelievable.

01:00:51.849 --> 01:00:53.684
A 32?

01:00:53.751 --> 01:00:54.785
That's for real.

01:00:54.852 --> 01:00:56.286
A 3 in front of a 2.

01:00:56.353 --> 01:00:57.587
-Oh, my God!
-Wait!

01:00:57.654 --> 01:00:58.989
I have something to say!

01:00:59.056 --> 01:01:01.458
And she got 99?

01:01:01.525 --> 01:01:02.592
Were they high?

01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:04.729
Were the people
in the test group high?

01:01:06.030 --> 01:01:07.732
Did we drug test them?

01:01:07.798 --> 01:01:10.935
Were they just sitting
in the studio, smoking crack?

01:01:11.001 --> 01:01:14.038
Saying "let's give her a 99
and him a 32?

01:01:14.104 --> 01:01:16.406
"By the way,
I'm high on crack!"

01:01:16.473 --> 01:01:18.709
I have something to say!

01:01:18.776 --> 01:01:20.177
What?

01:01:20.244 --> 01:01:22.112
You're a jerk.

01:01:22.179 --> 01:01:23.513
What did you just say?

01:01:26.650 --> 01:01:27.785
I said...

01:01:27.852 --> 01:01:29.653
You're a jerk!

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:32.122
Everything is about you.

01:01:32.189 --> 01:01:33.924
You are selfish

01:01:33.991 --> 01:01:35.926
and you are self-centered.

01:01:35.993 --> 01:01:37.361
And you...you lied to me.

01:01:37.427 --> 01:01:39.496
You said you needed me.
You don't need anyone!

01:01:39.563 --> 01:01:42.366
Listen, sweetie, why don't you
go to your trailer
and take a Midol?

01:01:42.432 --> 01:01:45.669
Hey! You be quiet or
I'll give you a tail!

01:01:45.736 --> 01:01:48.072
-Just calm down.
-You sit down!

01:01:49.306 --> 01:01:50.540
Sit down.

01:01:50.607 --> 01:01:51.608
Wow...

01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:56.380
This show is supposed
to be about a marriage.

01:01:56.446 --> 01:01:59.917
A real marriage
with real problems, like...

01:01:59.984 --> 01:02:02.152
like what color to paint
the kitchen or...

01:02:02.219 --> 01:02:04.621
or I don't know,
other problems. I can't even
think of them right now

01:02:04.688 --> 01:02:07.191
but the only problems
you care about are your own!

01:02:07.257 --> 01:02:10.427
No wonder the audience
doesn't like this show.

01:02:11.528 --> 01:02:13.297
A witch marries a mortal.

01:02:13.363 --> 01:02:16.000
Who in their right mind
would want to marry you?

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:17.367
-Hey...
-That's it...

01:02:17.434 --> 01:02:18.936
You're fired.

01:02:19.003 --> 01:02:20.337
Doesn't matter. I...

01:02:20.404 --> 01:02:21.671
I quit!

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:23.974
Yeah.

01:02:24.041 --> 01:02:25.042
So...

01:02:26.043 --> 01:02:27.711
You better call my agent.

01:02:27.778 --> 01:02:29.213
You don't have an agent.

01:02:29.279 --> 01:02:31.181
Then call my cable man.

01:02:41.258 --> 01:02:43.027
(WHISTLES) Sorry...

01:02:43.093 --> 01:02:44.661
So, uh...

01:02:44.728 --> 01:02:45.996
You all right?

01:02:46.063 --> 01:02:48.165
No one's talked to me like
that in 20 years.

01:02:48.232 --> 01:02:50.600
Once a week, a woman
talks to me like that.

01:02:50.667 --> 01:02:52.569
She just stripped
me bare and...

01:02:52.636 --> 01:02:53.838
stuck the knife in.

01:02:53.904 --> 01:02:55.973
Let's go to the peninsula
and get some oysters.

01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:57.174
You know what I think?

01:02:57.707 --> 01:02:58.708
Hey.

01:02:58.775 --> 01:03:00.577
The woman needs a part.

01:03:00.644 --> 01:03:02.012
I'm sorry?

01:03:02.079 --> 01:03:04.514
I mean, if you got Sammy Sosa,
you don't bench him.

01:03:04.581 --> 01:03:06.716
If you got Gorbachev
in the ballet,

01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:08.085
you let him dance
the big number.

01:03:08.152 --> 01:03:09.887
I don't think Gorbachev
was a dancer.

01:03:09.954 --> 01:03:12.156
Yes he was, Ritchie.
He absolutely was.

01:03:12.222 --> 01:03:13.423
Look it up.

01:03:19.129 --> 01:03:20.230
Isabel!

01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:21.531
Hey!

01:03:21.598 --> 01:03:23.167
Hey, Isabel!

01:03:23.233 --> 01:03:25.035
Wait! Wait, don't go!

01:03:25.102 --> 01:03:26.503
Isabel.

01:03:26.570 --> 01:03:28.305
Please don't go.
Please don't go. That...

01:03:28.372 --> 01:03:30.240
That was incredible.

01:03:30.307 --> 01:03:32.776
-What?
-Just now! That.

01:03:32.843 --> 01:03:34.311
-Hey!
-You yelled at me.

01:03:34.378 --> 01:03:35.445
You were upfront

01:03:35.512 --> 01:03:36.580
and honest

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:38.082
and you called me out

01:03:38.148 --> 01:03:39.349
on all my crap.

01:03:39.416 --> 01:03:40.717
It was just great!

01:03:40.784 --> 01:03:42.819
-Ah!
-Oh, God.

01:03:42.887 --> 01:03:45.122
I've never done
anything like this.

01:03:45.189 --> 01:03:47.591
It was very hard,
but secretly quite thrilling.

01:03:48.492 --> 01:03:49.960
Even my ex-wife...

01:03:50.027 --> 01:03:51.195
She never yelled.

01:03:51.261 --> 01:03:52.496
She just locked me out.

01:03:52.562 --> 01:03:54.064
Oh! In my family,

01:03:54.131 --> 01:03:55.732
we usually just disappear.

01:03:55.799 --> 01:03:57.968
No, no. Don't disappear,
Isabel.

01:03:58.035 --> 01:03:59.169
One more show.

01:04:00.905 --> 01:04:03.273
-I don't think so.
-No, one more taping.

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:05.475
-Please?
-No.
-It's just that...

01:04:05.542 --> 01:04:06.911
I'm feeling that...

01:04:06.977 --> 01:04:08.778
I'm feeling like maybe...

01:04:08.845 --> 01:04:10.314
I'm sorry.

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:11.581
What'd you say?

01:04:13.383 --> 01:04:14.384
I'm sorry

01:04:14.451 --> 01:04:15.552
for how I've been.

01:04:16.486 --> 01:04:17.854
You're sweating again, I...

01:04:19.423 --> 01:04:20.857
I just...
Look.

01:04:20.925 --> 01:04:23.193
-One more.
-I love it when you sweat.

01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:25.862
One more. Just...

01:04:25.930 --> 01:04:28.365
One more and the second
I'm being a jerk, you can yell

01:04:28.432 --> 01:04:30.234
"Hey! He's being a jerk!"

01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:32.269
And we'll shut
the whole thing down.
I promise.

01:04:32.336 --> 01:04:34.338
We'll burn down
the sets and...

01:04:34.404 --> 01:04:37.407
and sell the costumes and give
the money to little children.

01:04:37.474 --> 01:04:39.910
I mean, that's one
possible scenario.

01:04:39.977 --> 01:04:42.379
You want me to say
"he's being a jerk?"

01:04:42.446 --> 01:04:43.880
You can yell it, I mean...

01:04:43.948 --> 01:04:45.449
He's being a jerk!

01:04:45.515 --> 01:04:48.585
-Yeah...
-He's being a jerk!

01:04:48.652 --> 01:04:49.653
Yes.

01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:51.521
(YELLING)
(GROWLING)

01:04:53.657 --> 01:04:56.426
I can't just walk back
in there now.

01:04:56.493 --> 01:04:58.295
Once you show up
on a golf-cart,

01:04:58.362 --> 01:05:00.097
believe me, all is forgiven.

01:05:00.164 --> 01:05:01.298
I've done it a lot of times.

01:05:01.365 --> 01:05:02.732
I was fired.

01:05:02.799 --> 01:05:03.800
Oh no!

01:05:03.867 --> 01:05:05.169
-That's right, I quit.
-Yeah!

01:05:05.235 --> 01:05:06.636
-Yeah.
-Hey, let me carry your plant.

01:05:16.813 --> 01:05:18.515
Honey, your mother's here.

01:05:18.582 --> 01:05:19.984
Are you two getting along?

01:05:20.050 --> 01:05:21.718
Not exactly.

01:05:21.785 --> 01:05:24.121
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

01:05:25.855 --> 01:05:27.924
-Like this?
-Uh-huh. You're doing great.

01:05:27.992 --> 01:05:29.559
Really, really great.
One more time.

01:05:31.228 --> 01:05:33.130
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

01:05:33.197 --> 01:05:36.800
* If you like making love
at midnight

01:05:36.866 --> 01:05:40.237
* In the dunes
on the cape

01:05:40.304 --> 01:05:43.640
* Then I'm the love
that you've looked for

01:05:43.707 --> 01:05:46.176
* Write to me and escape

01:05:46.243 --> 01:05:49.579
So it says here that marriage
can lead to a loss of passion.

01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:51.215
It's true.

01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:53.850
I feel empty and bored
already.

01:05:53.917 --> 01:05:56.153
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

01:05:59.089 --> 01:06:00.924
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

01:06:00.991 --> 01:06:03.060
Oh, great. It's you.

01:06:03.127 --> 01:06:04.328
Mother...

01:06:04.394 --> 01:06:06.263
I see you two are actually
getting along.

01:06:06.330 --> 01:06:09.233
Endora, you rancid fruit-bag,
get outta my room.

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:12.302
And my daughter is happy?

01:06:12.369 --> 01:06:16.140
That is the cruelest
twist of all.

01:06:17.974 --> 01:06:19.876
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

01:06:19.943 --> 01:06:21.645
I am happy, Darrin.

01:06:21.711 --> 01:06:24.214
Real, honest, no-spells
happy.

01:06:25.149 --> 01:06:26.150
Mmm...

01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:28.752
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:30.120
And cut.

01:06:34.424 --> 01:06:36.060
Actors, cut.

01:06:36.126 --> 01:06:38.062
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

01:06:39.196 --> 01:06:40.730
Really cut now.

01:06:41.765 --> 01:06:43.633
You were great today.

01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:45.035
Just absolutely amazing.

01:06:45.102 --> 01:06:47.137
I don't think I've ever had
so much fun.

01:06:47.204 --> 01:06:48.372
Acting is fun.

01:06:49.573 --> 01:06:52.242
That is a profoundly
true thing.

01:06:54.478 --> 01:06:55.845
Would you like
a water chestnut?

01:06:55.912 --> 01:06:57.747
I'd love a water chestnut.

01:06:58.915 --> 01:06:59.949
(SIGHS)

01:07:05.155 --> 01:07:07.691
I'm gonna teach you
everything I know,

01:07:07.757 --> 01:07:09.059
starting with...

01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:11.761
the eye thing.

01:07:11.828 --> 01:07:14.698
The famous, crazy eye thing...
of mine

01:07:14.764 --> 01:07:15.765
Okay?

01:07:20.137 --> 01:07:22.139
This almost won me
a Golden Globe.

01:07:22.972 --> 01:07:24.074
Almost.

01:07:25.975 --> 01:07:27.411
-Is that it?
-That's good.

01:07:28.378 --> 01:07:30.013
Oh, that's even better.

01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:33.517
This is the "I just realized
things are worse than
they seem"...

01:07:33.583 --> 01:07:35.919
thing. Also known as the
"yikes take".

01:07:37.387 --> 01:07:38.488
(GRUNTS)

01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:39.689
Yikes.

01:07:40.790 --> 01:07:41.858
Wow.

01:07:42.892 --> 01:07:44.594
Yikes!

01:07:44.661 --> 01:07:47.364
-That was terrible.
-It's okay.
-No, I was terrible.

01:07:47.431 --> 01:07:48.565
I don't think mine
was good either.

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:52.202
That's it. I'm out of tricks.

01:07:52.269 --> 01:07:53.770
What about the funny
walk you do?

01:07:53.837 --> 01:07:54.904
-The funny walk?
-Mmm-hmm.

01:07:54.971 --> 01:07:56.806
-You don't wanna see
the funny walk.
-I do.

01:07:56.873 --> 01:07:58.408
The funny walk is
embarrassing.

01:07:58.475 --> 01:07:59.843
I'd like to see.

01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:01.378
-Yeah?
-Mmm-hmm.

01:08:02.412 --> 01:08:03.413
Okay.

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:04.948
Let's go to our place.

01:08:16.693 --> 01:08:18.462
-That it?
-Great.

01:08:19.662 --> 01:08:21.930
-It's much harder
than it looks.
-Yeah.

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:46.122
Five, six, seven, eight.

01:09:19.689 --> 01:09:20.689
Whoo!

01:09:54.691 --> 01:09:55.692
(MEOWS)

01:10:00.163 --> 01:10:03.367
Something magical happened
all by itself.

Table read in ten minutes!

01:10:11.708 --> 01:10:13.643
-Good morning, everyone!
-Good morning, Jack.

01:10:17.013 --> 01:10:19.549
Jack, I just need to talk
to you about a couple
of these things.

01:10:19.616 --> 01:10:22.419
Number one, we're thinking
about moving

01:10:22.486 --> 01:10:25.021
the whole kitchen scene.
Just, it's such...

01:10:25.088 --> 01:10:26.623
-It's...
-It's a funny scene.

01:10:26.690 --> 01:10:28.792
It's really funny.
We'd like to get it in

01:10:28.858 --> 01:10:29.926
a little earlier.

01:10:29.993 --> 01:10:32.296
So probably what we're gonna
do is switch it...

01:10:32.362 --> 01:10:33.597
with the office.

01:10:35.732 --> 01:10:38.868
But we're gonna drop that till
a little later in the show.

01:10:38.935 --> 01:10:41.338
(GIGGLING)

01:10:41.405 --> 01:10:44.774
Dude, are you watching
Jack throw the vibe
to Isabel right now?

01:10:44.841 --> 01:10:45.875
(WHISPERING) How are you?

01:10:45.942 --> 01:10:46.943
Ooo...

01:10:49.746 --> 01:10:50.847
I'm great.

01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:57.987
That's for you.

01:10:58.054 --> 01:10:59.289
Thank you.

01:11:00.223 --> 01:11:01.224
Mmm!

01:11:02.058 --> 01:11:04.060
That's fantastic.

01:11:04.127 --> 01:11:07.297
Stop.

01:11:07.364 --> 01:11:11.301
Yeah, I can find something
for him. I can put him in a
little part with maybe no...

01:11:11.368 --> 01:11:13.503
no lines or anything
like that.

01:11:13.570 --> 01:11:16.105
What is going on
between you and Jack?

01:11:16.172 --> 01:11:17.907
Nothing is going on.

01:11:17.974 --> 01:11:19.943
We had a date and we kissed

01:11:20.009 --> 01:11:22.979
and now we just wanna spend
all of our time together.

01:11:23.046 --> 01:11:26.282
That is the very definition
of something going on.

01:11:26.350 --> 01:11:27.684
And you know what?

01:11:27.751 --> 01:11:30.920
I didn't use any tricks.
I am trick-free.

01:11:30.987 --> 01:11:34.023
Oh my God, it's her.

01:11:34.090 --> 01:11:37.427
-Who?
-Jack's wife. I saw a picture
of her in In Style.

01:11:37.494 --> 01:11:39.162
She was the "fashion don't."

01:11:39.228 --> 01:11:41.531
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Jack.

01:11:41.598 --> 01:11:44.033
You must be Samantha.

01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:45.902
You look just like
the old one.

01:11:46.636 --> 01:11:48.104
Thank you so much.

-Excuse me.

Love the nose.

Good work.

There's my guy!

01:11:58.882 --> 01:12:01.050
I've missed him so much.

"do not disturb" sign will be
on the door-knob tonight.

-My God!

01:12:14.798 --> 01:12:16.232
That was a little harsh.

Hi, baby.

What are you doing here?

01:12:34.751 --> 01:12:36.119
You want my car?

01:12:36.185 --> 01:12:37.721
My grandmother's brooch?

01:12:37.787 --> 01:12:38.888
Oh!

01:12:38.955 --> 01:12:40.123
You want more money.

Correct answer.

01:12:43.393 --> 01:12:44.394
No.

01:12:45.729 --> 01:12:46.963
I want you back.

01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:48.565
What about Captain Underpants?

01:12:48.632 --> 01:12:50.834
I'm through with him.

You heard the show's
getting picked up.

I heard it's gonna be a hit.

01:12:59.142 --> 01:13:01.044
So what?

01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:02.446
I want you.

01:13:02.512 --> 01:13:04.448
I want my husband.

01:13:07.050 --> 01:13:09.152
You know, a week ago,
I would have fallen for that.

01:13:11.755 --> 01:13:13.923
But now there's someone else.

Someone who's...

01:13:15.158 --> 01:13:17.226
incapable of guile.

01:13:17.293 --> 01:13:18.394
What's guile?

01:13:19.563 --> 01:13:20.830
Not gonna do it.

01:13:20.897 --> 01:13:22.466
I think it means tricks.

I love you, baby.

01:13:26.069 --> 01:13:27.270
No, I'm not.

01:13:29.706 --> 01:13:31.040

And...

01:13:55.965 --> 01:13:57.066
one more time.

papers right now.

of the house...

just see that?

You're out of control.

Every time I think I have
things nailed down,

01:15:09.505 --> 01:15:10.874
I just lose it.

01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:12.876

on yourself.

01:15:12.942 --> 01:15:14.477

please. I just wanna say
a few words.

Randall, can you help...

01:15:30.827 --> 01:15:32.061
deal with this?

01:15:32.128 --> 01:15:33.129
Thank you.

all of you amazing,
talented people,

and especially Isabel.

01:15:53.617 --> 01:15:57.286
To a woman who would never
trick me into thinking she was
something she wasn't.

01:15:59.689 --> 01:16:02.525
From now on,
everyone tells the truth.
Okay?

01:16:02.592 --> 01:16:04.761
Except, of course, if I don't
look good, say I do anyway.

a beautiful person

01:16:13.269 --> 01:16:15.004
and that's the truth.

01:16:15.071 --> 01:16:16.940
-Cheers!
-EVERYONE: Cheers!

01:16:17.006 --> 01:16:19.442
-Have a great time!
-Cheers.

JACK: Don't break
anything, okay?

01:16:33.723 --> 01:16:35.591
I hope that touching speech

01:16:35.659 --> 01:16:37.894
doesn't make you think
that you should tell the truth
about yourself.

01:16:37.961 --> 01:16:39.663
-I'm going to.
-Don't be silly.

01:16:39.729 --> 01:16:41.330
And he's gonna accept me.
He's got to

01:16:41.397 --> 01:16:43.299
because you can't live
with a secret like that.

01:16:43.366 --> 01:16:45.902
Of course you can,
for thousands of years.

01:16:46.736 --> 01:16:48.004
Don't do it.

01:16:48.071 --> 01:16:49.105
Big mistake.

01:16:49.172 --> 01:16:50.640
Won't work.

01:16:50.707 --> 01:16:53.109

Yes, thank you.

and I'm Nigel Bigelow.

01:17:05.855 --> 01:17:07.657
Yes.

01:17:07.724 --> 01:17:10.960
I will sleep with you
because I have a thing
for father figures.

01:17:11.027 --> 01:17:12.395
Well, that's great then.

01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:14.931
But in the morning, I will not
get 90 percent of your jokes

01:17:14.998 --> 01:17:19.635
and I will go on and on about
my dream of opening an aerobic
center in Agoura.

01:17:24.407 --> 01:17:26.009
Are you looking for me?

01:17:26.075 --> 01:17:27.076
Missing you, actually.

01:17:28.544 --> 01:17:29.779
How strange.

01:17:29.846 --> 01:17:30.880
Not really.

01:17:44.861 --> 01:17:48.564
I'm just gonna say it like
it's a completely
matter-of-fact thing.

-Can I get your car, miss?

-Of course not.

-What?
-Because I can't get
pregnant right now.

01:27:48.497 --> 01:27:50.699
It's been like that
since the beginning.

01:27:50.766 --> 01:27:52.568
Only now...

01:27:52.635 --> 01:27:54.403
I also hate him.

01:27:55.538 --> 01:27:56.605
Love.

01:28:00.242 --> 01:28:01.544
Daddy?

01:28:01.610 --> 01:28:03.178
What am I gonna do?

01:28:03.245 --> 01:28:04.347
Go home.

01:28:05.013 --> 01:28:06.248
Where's that?

01:28:06.315 --> 01:28:08.784
Wherever you've been
the happiest.

01:28:08.851 --> 01:28:10.953
Perhaps I'll go to Aruba.

01:28:11.019 --> 01:28:13.255
-Aruba?
-But then again...

01:28:13.322 --> 01:28:14.590
perhaps I won't.

01:28:23.131 --> 01:28:24.767
(ON TV) I don't know if I'm
loving my hair-cut.

01:28:24.833 --> 01:28:26.369
Well, Con...

01:28:26.435 --> 01:28:28.170
I can't believe you're
bringing this up.

01:28:28.236 --> 01:28:30.038
No, no! No no no.

01:28:30.105 --> 01:28:31.674
No, I'm not gonna
tell that story.

01:28:31.740 --> 01:28:33.742
There's no way...
Okay, okay!

01:28:33.809 --> 01:28:35.878
If you insist...

01:28:35.944 --> 01:28:37.880
It was last June and...

01:28:37.946 --> 01:28:39.415
I actually...

01:28:39.482 --> 01:28:41.484
cast this witch as a witch

01:28:41.550 --> 01:28:43.652
and now brooms make me cry.

01:28:43.719 --> 01:28:45.153
I can't sleep and...

01:28:45.220 --> 01:28:47.756
I don't know what's real
or what's the TV show.

01:28:47.823 --> 01:28:49.458
-Hidey-ho!
-(SCREAMS)

01:28:49.525 --> 01:28:51.193
Look what the cat dragged in.

01:28:51.259 --> 01:28:53.328
Somebody is retaining water.

01:28:53.396 --> 01:28:55.030
Uncle Arthur?

01:28:55.097 --> 01:28:56.231
It's you!

01:28:56.298 --> 01:28:58.567
Oh no. You're gonna crack
the mirror, aren't you?

01:28:58.634 --> 01:29:00.436
You watch too much television.

01:29:00.503 --> 01:29:02.204
I know you're gonna do
what you always do.

01:29:02.270 --> 01:29:04.272
Don't be silly.
Come closer.

01:29:04.339 --> 01:29:05.774
Do I have something
in my teeth, right there?

01:29:06.341 --> 01:29:07.376
-Where?
-Look!

01:29:07.443 --> 01:29:09.311
(SCREAMS)

01:29:09.378 --> 01:29:11.279
UNCLE ARTHUR: (LAUGHING)

01:29:12.715 --> 01:29:14.717
That was fun.

01:29:15.217 --> 01:29:16.385
Where's Sammy?

01:29:16.452 --> 01:29:17.853
Where's my Sammy?

01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:19.021
She quit.

01:29:19.087 --> 01:29:20.489
Now leave me alone.

01:29:20.556 --> 01:29:21.757
But she was the one.

01:29:21.824 --> 01:29:23.025
I know.

01:29:23.091 --> 01:29:25.327
I know. I can't stop
thinking about her.

01:29:25.394 --> 01:29:26.595
But she's a witch.

01:29:26.662 --> 01:29:27.963
Yes, and?

01:29:28.030 --> 01:29:30.433
-MAN: Jack, you're on!
-Oh no, I'm on!

01:29:30.499 --> 01:29:31.734
Go get em, Tiger.

01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:33.902
...revival of a hit series
Bewitched.

01:29:33.969 --> 01:29:37.139
Of course you know him from
such films as Last year
in Katmandu,

01:29:37.205 --> 01:29:39.708
An Onion for Willie
and Atticus Rex.

01:29:39.775 --> 01:29:41.076
Please welcome our good pal,

01:29:41.143 --> 01:29:42.144
Jack Wyatt.

01:29:44.747 --> 01:29:47.049
(CROWD CHEERING)

01:29:47.115 --> 01:29:48.150
Ah!

01:29:48.216 --> 01:29:50.018
(CROWD LAUGHING)

01:29:54.022 --> 01:29:56.825
(SCREAMING)

01:29:56.892 --> 01:29:57.893
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

01:29:57.960 --> 01:29:59.027
Oh, my God.

01:29:59.094 --> 01:30:00.429
It was a dream.

01:30:01.564 --> 01:30:02.631
Thank God.

01:30:03.566 --> 01:30:05.033
No such luck, Jacky boy.

01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:06.569
-(SCREAMS)
-(LAUGHING)

01:30:06.635 --> 01:30:07.836
Stay back!

01:30:09.071 --> 01:30:11.339
You are not real.

01:30:11.406 --> 01:30:12.441
You're from the TV show.

01:30:12.508 --> 01:30:14.276
You have blond highlights

01:30:14.342 --> 01:30:16.612
and you had to wear a girdle
on your last movie.

01:30:16.679 --> 01:30:18.180
Who's calling who not real?

01:30:18.246 --> 01:30:19.815
I do not believe this.

01:30:22.951 --> 01:30:24.086
You are real.

01:30:24.152 --> 01:30:25.353
Temporarily.

01:30:25.420 --> 01:30:27.756
Oh, Uncle Arthur?

01:30:27.823 --> 01:30:29.458
You're my favorite character.

01:30:29.525 --> 01:30:31.159
I know.

01:30:31.226 --> 01:30:32.595
What the hell's going on?

01:30:32.661 --> 01:30:35.531
You need help.
Your love life's a mess,
buddy boy.

01:30:35.598 --> 01:30:37.432
I know. I'm miserable.

01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:38.534
So am I.

01:30:38.601 --> 01:30:42.170
I have been in reruns
for 32 years!

01:30:42.237 --> 01:30:44.439
I need the sizzle
of prime time.

01:30:44.507 --> 01:30:46.341
I need to get this show
back on the air.

01:30:46.408 --> 01:30:48.076
Okay, this is very complicated

01:30:48.143 --> 01:30:49.411
and unsettling, all right?

01:30:49.478 --> 01:30:51.146
I don't think I understand.

01:30:51.980 --> 01:30:54.016
All right. Do you want the...

01:30:54.082 --> 01:30:56.585
short version or
the long version?

01:30:56.652 --> 01:30:59.855
Keep in mind that the long
version is in Aramaic.

01:30:59.922 --> 01:31:01.323
The short version.

01:31:01.389 --> 01:31:02.758
You got involved with a witch

01:31:02.825 --> 01:31:04.426
and when you do that,

01:31:04.493 --> 01:31:07.696
weird stuff happens.

01:31:07.763 --> 01:31:10.633
-That's it?
-Do I have to explain
everything to you?

01:31:10.699 --> 01:31:12.635
Okay, here's the deal.

01:31:12.701 --> 01:31:14.002
I'm not real.

01:31:14.069 --> 01:31:16.104
-Hmm?
-Iris is a witch...

01:31:16.171 --> 01:31:18.206
-Iris is a witch?
-Don't dwell...

01:31:18.273 --> 01:31:19.675
And in my opinion, that...

01:31:19.742 --> 01:31:22.110
-manager of yours, Ritchie...
-What?

01:31:22.177 --> 01:31:23.812
(WHISPERING)
isn't even human.

01:31:23.879 --> 01:31:25.147
Now, where was I?

01:31:25.213 --> 01:31:27.415
-When?
-Before you walk out...
Oh, right!

01:31:27.482 --> 01:31:29.051
Who wants to be with a witch?

01:31:29.117 --> 01:31:31.486
Right! Crazy crap like this
would always be happening.

01:31:31.554 --> 01:31:32.888
And your point is?

01:31:32.955 --> 01:31:34.489
The point is you'd never know.

01:31:34.557 --> 01:31:36.091
What?

01:31:36.158 --> 01:31:38.326
Whether you were in love
with her or whether she just
put a spell on you.

01:31:38.393 --> 01:31:41.096
-You'd never know.
-Like when you first spotted
her in the bookstore.

01:31:41.163 --> 01:31:42.330
Probably her idea, right?

01:31:42.397 --> 01:31:43.899
No, that was my idea.

01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:48.470
-Oh, that's terrible.
-I know. I just love to blend.

01:31:48.537 --> 01:31:52.575
And when you got down on your
knees and you begged her to
take the job?

01:31:52.641 --> 01:31:55.844
-What are you saying?
-She probably planted
the words in your head.

01:31:55.911 --> 01:31:57.546
-No way. My words.
-Mmm-hmm...

01:31:57.613 --> 01:32:00.015
Yeah? What about the nose?

01:32:00.082 --> 01:32:01.750
Hello!

01:32:01.817 --> 01:32:03.385
Is that even really her nose?

01:32:03.451 --> 01:32:05.688
Of course it's her real nose.

01:32:05.754 --> 01:32:07.590
All I'm saying is...

01:32:07.656 --> 01:32:09.758
who wants to be with a witch?

01:32:32.314 --> 01:32:33.315
I do.

01:32:35.283 --> 01:32:37.085
She's going home.

01:32:37.152 --> 01:32:39.988
And once a witch returns home,
she can't come back
for 100 years.

01:32:40.055 --> 01:32:41.590
She can't leave...

01:32:42.290 --> 01:32:44.092
I need her.

01:32:44.159 --> 01:32:45.694
I want her. I want Isabel.

01:32:45.761 --> 01:32:47.529
Well, come on.
Let's go get her.

01:32:47.596 --> 01:32:49.331
Here we go!
Let's go!

01:32:49.397 --> 01:32:50.599
Let's go get her!

01:32:50.666 --> 01:32:52.334
Follow me. Follow me!
Here we go!

01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:53.669
Come on.
Here we go!

01:33:02.244 --> 01:33:04.246
Better hurry. She's leaving
right this minute.

01:33:04.312 --> 01:33:06.248
We've gotta stop her.

01:33:06.314 --> 01:33:08.350
Hey, wait. You can't drive,
remember?

01:33:08.416 --> 01:33:11.186
Remember that episode where
you pulled out of the driveway
and almost crashed?

01:33:11.253 --> 01:33:13.288
Well, that wasn't exactly me.

01:33:13.355 --> 01:33:16.291
I, personally,
am a great driver.

01:33:17.525 --> 01:33:19.294
Wupsy doodle.

01:33:19.361 --> 01:33:21.463
-Wee!
-(SCREAMING)

01:33:24.399 --> 01:33:26.568
Take it easy!

01:33:26.635 --> 01:33:28.570
Could you slow down
just a tad?

01:33:28.637 --> 01:33:30.939
Is it "Porsche" or is
it "Porscha?"

01:33:31.006 --> 01:33:32.374
Who cares? Watch the road!

01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:34.009
Please! We've gotta
get Isabel!

01:33:34.076 --> 01:33:35.811
Oh, all right, party-pooper.

01:33:35.878 --> 01:33:37.112
UNCLE ARTHUR: Let me drive!

01:33:38.413 --> 01:33:39.514
There she is!

01:33:39.581 --> 01:33:41.984
-Where?
-Oh no! She's flying away!

01:33:42.050 --> 01:33:43.551
Pedal to the metal,
buddy boy!

01:33:46.054 --> 01:33:47.222
Watch it!

01:33:50.025 --> 01:33:52.527
I'm about to be killed
by a fictional character.

01:33:52.594 --> 01:33:54.429
(LAUGHING)
Yes, you are.

01:34:01.403 --> 01:34:02.470
We're here.

01:34:02.537 --> 01:34:04.172
Here? Where?

01:34:04.907 --> 01:34:06.074
Where is she?

01:34:07.475 --> 01:34:08.677
Our place.

01:34:09.544 --> 01:34:10.713
She's at our place.

01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:13.548
Thank you.

01:34:13.615 --> 01:34:15.117
Thank you, Uncle Arthur.

01:34:16.551 --> 01:34:18.420
Run to her, you idiot.

01:34:45.113 --> 01:34:46.448
Isabel...

01:34:50.618 --> 01:34:52.087
Oh, my God.

01:34:52.154 --> 01:34:53.655
You're here.

01:34:53.722 --> 01:34:55.223
I'm so happy you're here.

01:34:55.290 --> 01:34:56.291
I'm leaving.

01:34:56.358 --> 01:34:57.960
No, no, no.
You can't.

01:34:58.026 --> 01:35:00.128
You'll be gone forever
if you leave.

01:35:00.195 --> 01:35:03.065
You'll be gone a hundred years
without being able to come
back, even if you miss me.

01:35:03.131 --> 01:35:04.566
That's ridiculous.

01:35:04.632 --> 01:35:05.834
Who told you that?

01:35:05.901 --> 01:35:07.235
He did!

01:35:07.302 --> 01:35:09.271
UNCLE ARTHUR: (LAUGHING)

01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:14.042
Well...

01:35:14.109 --> 01:35:15.978
What are you doing here
if you're leaving?

01:35:17.746 --> 01:35:19.381
I was going home.

01:35:19.447 --> 01:35:20.448
But...

01:35:20.515 --> 01:35:22.317
I don't know where that is.

01:35:23.418 --> 01:35:25.087
Home is with me.

01:35:26.054 --> 01:35:27.389
Don't go, please.

01:35:27.455 --> 01:35:28.791
-But I'm...
-Shh...

01:35:28.857 --> 01:35:30.192
We'll work it out.

01:35:30.258 --> 01:35:32.127
-We can't.
-Yes we can.

01:35:32.194 --> 01:35:33.628
I can't be normal

01:35:33.695 --> 01:35:35.497
because I'm a witch.

01:35:35.563 --> 01:35:37.699
I can't be a witch

01:35:37.766 --> 01:35:40.468
because I really
wanna be normal.

01:35:40.535 --> 01:35:41.804
It's not possible.

01:35:41.870 --> 01:35:43.671
Of course it's possible.

01:35:43.738 --> 01:35:46.041
There's tons of other
witches who've done it.

01:35:47.075 --> 01:35:48.476
Who?

01:35:48.543 --> 01:35:50.712
Well, maybe not tons
of other witches, but...

01:35:51.313 --> 01:35:52.580
at least one.

01:35:55.150 --> 01:35:56.785
Samantha.

01:35:58.020 --> 01:35:59.955
Caught between two worlds

01:36:00.022 --> 01:36:01.023
and yet...

01:36:01.089 --> 01:36:03.458
completely happy.

01:36:03.525 --> 01:36:05.928
She lived happily ever after,
in fact.

01:36:05.994 --> 01:36:09.264
Although there's no way
to be sure because she
went off the air.

01:36:09.331 --> 01:36:11.366
We'll work it out.

01:36:11.433 --> 01:36:13.168
Don't cry, little witch.

01:36:16.939 --> 01:36:18.606
I love you, Samantha.

01:36:19.641 --> 01:36:21.109
Isabel.

01:36:21.176 --> 01:36:22.310
I knew that.

01:36:23.311 --> 01:36:24.779
I think.

01:36:24.847 --> 01:36:26.314
I love you, Darrin.

01:36:39.761 --> 01:36:41.296
I just occurred to me,
you could have...

01:36:41.964 --> 01:36:43.265
any guy...

01:36:43.331 --> 01:36:45.633
-Uh-huh...
-in the whole world.

01:36:45.700 --> 01:36:48.403
Oh, but I choose you.

01:36:48.470 --> 01:36:51.006
Honestly, I think you made
a mistake.

01:36:51.073 --> 01:36:53.108
If I did, I could always
get out of it.

01:36:53.708 --> 01:36:54.709
(MEOW)

01:36:59.447 --> 01:37:00.883
Now we have things to do.

01:37:00.949 --> 01:37:02.184
Mmm-hmm.

01:37:02.250 --> 01:37:04.019
We have a show to do.

01:37:04.086 --> 01:37:05.988
-Yes.
-And then...

01:37:06.054 --> 01:37:08.223
maybe after a while,
we could get married.

01:37:27.642 --> 01:37:29.011
JACK: There it is!

01:37:32.447 --> 01:37:33.581
Abner, come look!

01:37:33.648 --> 01:37:35.417
The new neighbors
are moving in!

01:37:35.483 --> 01:37:37.619
Not now, Gladys. I'm busy.

01:37:38.954 --> 01:37:40.622
Ah, yes.

01:37:40.688 --> 01:37:43.959
I'm now going to carry you
across the threshold.

01:37:48.196 --> 01:37:50.798
ISABEL: Don't you think
the front lawn looks
a little bare?

01:37:50.865 --> 01:37:52.134
JACK: No, I don't.

01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:54.136
ISABEL: But I think it
could use a little something.

01:37:54.202 --> 01:37:56.271
It's fine the way it is,
honey.

01:38:03.345 --> 01:38:04.712
Abner!

01:38:04.779 --> 01:38:07.249
A tree just appeared
in the front yard!
