<i>A Blood Pledge</i>

05:42.058 --> 05:46.995
Was there a special reason why
Un-joo wanted to walk home with you?

05:46.996 --> 05:48.521
No.

05:48.731 --> 05:54.101
She came by to meet Soy often,
so we didn't suspect anything strange.

05:55.104 --> 06:00.907
You were close friends for years
and shared secrets and such, right?

06:02.612 --> 06:09.518
Did she act strange recently
or say she wanted to die?

06:10.119 --> 06:11.484
No.

06:12.021 --> 06:13.688
I'm sorry, ma'am.

06:13.689 --> 06:16.725
If only we weren't there so late...

06:16.726 --> 06:18.093
It's not your fault.

06:18.094 --> 06:22.224
She said she was going
to the bathroom.

06:22.665 --> 06:27.330
Who knew something like that
would happen in less than 5 minutes.

08:19.582 --> 08:21.349
- What did the teacher say?
- Why'd she kill herself?

08:21.350 --> 08:22.984
Did she tell you why
Un-joo killed herself?

08:22.985 --> 08:25.320
She was such a good student.

08:25.321 --> 08:27.422
She didn't look like
someone who'd kill herself.

08:27.423 --> 08:30.058
Yeah, of course she did.

08:30.059 --> 08:32.360
Quiet and always
going around by herself.

08:32.361 --> 08:34.162
You should've seen her last year.

08:34.163 --> 08:36.791
She's totally different
from grade 10.

08:36.999 --> 08:39.467
Maybe she got dumped by a guy?

08:39.467 --> 08:40.936
That's what I was thinking!

08:40.937 --> 08:42.871
Why would she kill herself
over a guy?

08:42.871 --> 08:45.603
Then why?
She was smart, rich...

08:45.708 --> 08:48.678
She must've gotten
her heartbroken by a guy!

08:48.911 --> 08:50.504
How would you know?

08:50.780 --> 08:52.948
I was in the same class
with her last year.

08:52.949 --> 08:55.316
She came by here often
to meet you.

08:55.418 --> 08:56.952
Though you ignored her.

08:56.953 --> 09:01.890
You were best friends last year
but you totally dissed her this year!

09:01.891 --> 09:03.484
Stop it!

09:04.160 --> 09:07.862
Stop gossiping over
Un-joo like that.

09:07.863 --> 09:11.533
Weren't you with her too
when she died?

09:11.534 --> 09:14.526
Didn't she tell you girls anything?
Like a dying wish?

09:14.637 --> 09:18.904
Stop being so curious
and study for a change.

09:19.575 --> 09:20.872
Let's go, Soy.

09:22.812 --> 09:25.981
Ms. Stuck-up Bookworm!

09:25.982 --> 09:27.416
Damn bitches.

09:28.184 --> 09:29.345
Look Joo-yeon.

09:52.642 --> 09:53.803
Stop it!

09:56.279 --> 09:57.610
YOON Soy...

09:58.381 --> 10:00.748
You really didn't know
Un-joo was going to kill herself?

10:01.317 --> 10:04.651
Are you saying we knew
and didn't try to stop her?

10:04.754 --> 10:06.779
I wasn't talking to you.

10:07.990 --> 10:12.193
How can you not even go
to her funeral and think of eating?

10:12.194 --> 10:15.130
Soy didn't do anything!
Shut up!

10:15.131 --> 10:20.433
Everyone knows she was mean to Un-joo
after hanging around with you.

10:20.670 --> 10:22.695
Un-joo had no reason
to commit suicide!

10:22.905 --> 10:26.041
I had no idea
you were that close with her.

10:26.042 --> 10:27.342
We were classmates.

10:27.343 --> 10:31.012
If her classmates didn't know
she'd die, how would we!

10:31.013 --> 10:33.175
We weren't even classmates.

10:34.350 --> 10:36.084
I guess if the three
of you keep quiet,

10:36.085 --> 10:38.611
no one will know
what really happened.

10:43.426 --> 10:45.121
Say it again, bitch.

10:47.063 --> 10:50.328
You want to beat me
that badly, Joo-yeon?

10:51.000 --> 10:53.196
Like hell.

10:53.469 --> 10:57.167
No matter what you do,
you'll always be under me.

11:10.786 --> 11:12.276
<i>SOY -</i>

11:13.823 --> 11:16.793
I was looking all over for you.

11:17.326 --> 11:19.427
I was worried about you.

11:19.428 --> 11:21.123
It was there.

11:22.898 --> 11:25.595
I told Un-joo everything there,
yesterday.

11:26.402 --> 11:28.871
I had no idea Un-joo would do it.

11:29.205 --> 11:31.072
I shouldn't have met her...

11:31.073 --> 11:32.407
Soy!

11:32.408 --> 11:34.877
I should've died with her,
yesterday.

11:53.496 --> 11:55.590
Just try get some rest.

11:55.698 --> 11:58.998
Everything will get better soon.

12:24.026 --> 12:25.551
Soy!

12:25.995 --> 12:27.729
Why'd you come so late?

12:27.730 --> 12:30.165
Un-joo's been waiting for you.

12:30.332 --> 12:32.528
- Let's go in.
- No!

12:32.635 --> 12:35.764
What's wrong?
Aren't you staying?

12:36.038 --> 12:37.639
I'm sorry.
I'll come back, tomorrow.

12:37.640 --> 12:39.631
She won't be here, tomorrow.

12:39.975 --> 12:41.176
I'm sorry.

12:41.177 --> 12:42.770
About what?

12:44.280 --> 12:45.613
You know, don't you!

12:45.614 --> 12:47.148
You know why she died!

12:47.149 --> 12:48.050
No, I don't.

12:48.051 --> 12:51.186
I was supposed to meet her
outside Student Hall, yesterday.

12:51.187 --> 12:53.254
I was waiting for her...

12:53.255 --> 12:57.425
I had no idea how much my sister
was scared and hurt.

12:57.426 --> 13:00.161
I did nothing but
just wait for her.

13:00.162 --> 13:01.396
Tell me what happened!

13:01.397 --> 13:02.897
You were with her!

13:02.898 --> 13:04.923
I really don't know anything!

13:06.101 --> 13:07.535
Soy!

13:52.548 --> 13:57.714
May the Lord remember
sister LEE Un-joo.

13:58.621 --> 14:02.489
Along with those gone
before her...

14:02.791 --> 14:06.091
with the hope of resurrection.

14:06.195 --> 14:09.893
May she see the Lord's face.

14:10.332 --> 14:13.859
And may God also bless us
with eternal love...

14:52.775 --> 14:55.210
I don't want anything...

14:55.778 --> 15:01.080
But that we stay close
and be happy like this.

15:01.183 --> 15:04.218
It's not like I'm moving away.

15:04.219 --> 15:06.521
Of course we'll still
be best friends.

15:06.522 --> 15:10.652
Love changes.
Who says friendships won't?

15:11.260 --> 15:13.729
You better not change on me.

15:19.835 --> 15:22.103
Here, have this.

15:22.104 --> 15:26.641
No, you love music.
It's your MP3 player.

15:26.642 --> 15:29.410
It's a token of
our unchanging friendship.

15:29.411 --> 15:35.214
Don't lose it.
If you do, then you'll lose me.

15:35.417 --> 15:39.615
Think we can die at the same time?

15:39.722 --> 15:43.022
Of course not.
How's that possible?

15:44.860 --> 15:46.988
I want to see the sea!

15:47.796 --> 15:49.230
The sea?

15:49.632 --> 15:53.034
From here to way out there...

15:53.302 --> 15:56.203
I wish it was all
just the deep blue sea.

16:20.562 --> 16:23.259
We all promised not to come here.

16:40.482 --> 16:43.747
Thirteen children run down a street.

16:44.420 --> 16:47.412
They come to a dead end.

16:48.724 --> 16:51.694
The first child says
he is scared.

16:52.428 --> 16:55.796
The second child also says
he is scared.

16:56.799 --> 16:59.268
The third child also...

17:04.772 --> 17:06.400
YOON Soy!

17:06.575 --> 17:08.099
What are you doing!

17:23.058 --> 17:27.222
<i>YOON Soy, LEE Eu-gene,
KIM Eun-young</i>

17:35.637 --> 17:36.738
It was you, wasn't it!

17:36.739 --> 17:38.833
You wrote our names
on the front door!

17:38.974 --> 17:42.501
Stop acting so big
cuz you're Eu-gene's friend.

17:42.778 --> 17:44.112
Who says I wrote that!

17:44.113 --> 17:47.845
Who else would do that
besides you!

17:48.117 --> 17:50.586
Well... who knows?

17:50.652 --> 17:53.321
Maybe Un-joo wrote it there!

17:53.322 --> 17:54.448
What?

17:54.523 --> 17:58.619
This isn't your class.
Get out.

18:09.538 --> 18:11.768
Come on, Soy.

18:12.274 --> 18:14.834
I can't lie anymore!

18:15.344 --> 18:18.446
We promised not to tell anyone!

18:18.447 --> 18:20.882
Let's just tell the truth,
Eun-young.

18:21.150 --> 18:22.777
It's not too late.

18:22.885 --> 18:26.082
If we do, they'll forgive us.

18:26.188 --> 18:28.156
I know how you feel.

18:28.157 --> 18:30.285
I want to confess everything, too.

18:30.392 --> 18:32.059
But you know we can't.

18:32.060 --> 18:37.226
You told the cops yourself
you had no idea she'd kill herself.

18:37.633 --> 18:39.500
Eu-gene and I said
the same thing.

18:39.501 --> 18:42.493
How can we say we lied, now!

18:42.604 --> 18:44.197
I can't do it!

18:47.810 --> 18:53.146
If we tell the truth,
we'll all get expelled.

18:53.448 --> 18:59.046
We'll be stigmatized for life
as girls who tried to commit suicide.

18:59.354 --> 19:01.914
You saw the girls talk about us.

19:02.157 --> 19:05.893
They looked at us strange
just cuz we were with Un-joo.

19:05.894 --> 19:09.057
Who cares what the girls think!

19:09.298 --> 19:11.426
Stop acting like a saint!

19:12.301 --> 19:14.463
I saw Un-joo die, too!

19:14.570 --> 19:18.131
Think we're keeping quite
cuz it don't hurt us, too?

19:18.273 --> 19:21.943
Don't you care what happens
to me and Eu-gene?

19:21.944 --> 19:23.605
That's not what I mean!

19:24.012 --> 19:28.882
I'm sorry to Un-joo, too.
I feel the same as you.

19:31.787 --> 19:38.489
If Un-joo was really your friend,
she'd understand us.

19:58.981 --> 20:00.881
What's with you?

20:01.183 --> 20:03.015
You don't feel it?

20:03.151 --> 20:05.620
It feels like
someone's following us.

20:06.622 --> 20:10.091
There's no one there.

20:10.092 --> 20:11.617
I'm not joking.

20:11.727 --> 20:14.924
It felt like someone's behind us.

20:44.860 --> 20:46.658
I'm sorry, mom.

20:47.562 --> 20:52.864
The girls can't torture me anymore
if I die.

20:53.602 --> 20:56.071
I didn't say anything...

20:56.772 --> 21:00.709
Though school was a living hell
cuz of them.

21:01.209 --> 21:03.177
I want to die, mom!

21:04.646 --> 21:08.139
I'm killing myself
like that girl did at Student Hall.

23:38.500 --> 23:41.800
I work hard all day.

23:43.171 --> 23:45.538
And all you do is sleep!

23:45.841 --> 23:49.209
How will you make it to college!

23:49.344 --> 23:51.210
I'm sorry.

23:51.513 --> 23:53.747
How'll you make it to college!

23:53.748 --> 23:55.512
I'm sorry, dad!

24:58.980 --> 25:02.814
Can I keep guarding
the church key, please?

25:03.051 --> 25:04.450
Leave it and go.

25:05.020 --> 25:07.555
You couldn't make it
to top ten again.

25:07.556 --> 25:10.787
I promise to be first next time.

25:10.859 --> 25:14.818
That's what you said last time.

25:14.996 --> 25:17.863
How can you say that
after your test results!

25:18.266 --> 25:20.257
I can do it this time!

25:20.535 --> 25:25.974
The school has rules.
You dare go against it?

25:26.474 --> 25:32.641
You were the first to have the key
without being first last time.

25:37.185 --> 25:41.122
If I showed you such favor,
you should've studied harder!

25:41.223 --> 25:43.385
You haven't improved
since last time!

25:43.625 --> 25:46.993
All you did was
end up lying to me!

26:17.726 --> 26:19.393
<i>LEE Un-joo 1st place</i>

26:19.394 --> 26:21.988
Oh no! Un-joo got first place
but she died!

26:25.634 --> 26:27.033
Shut up!

26:33.541 --> 26:35.771
Wanna go to Student Hall?

26:36.044 --> 26:38.274
Crazy!
Why would we go there?

26:38.413 --> 26:39.744
I'm curious.

26:39.848 --> 26:47.653
They locked the door to the roof.
What's the use?

26:48.123 --> 26:52.326
What if there's a ghost!
I'm not going anywhere near it.

26:52.327 --> 26:54.862
Stupid.
There's no such thing as ghosts.

26:54.863 --> 26:58.832
I bet the ghost is
wandering in here...

26:58.833 --> 27:00.267
Stop it!

27:05.073 --> 27:08.737
Eun-young?
We need to talk.

27:09.010 --> 27:12.742
- Her dad must've hit her again.
- Pretend you don't notice.

27:14.883 --> 27:17.011
Leave me alone.

27:17.686 --> 27:19.814
It's important.

27:20.722 --> 27:22.554
Eun-young!

27:24.759 --> 27:29.162
Can I sleep at your place, tonight?

27:29.964 --> 27:35.403
Please?
I really don't want to go home.

27:43.845 --> 27:45.745
Aren't you all going to Mass?

27:46.214 --> 27:48.615
What's it to you?

28:01.963 --> 28:03.089
Bitch.

28:03.431 --> 28:04.865
You said it!

28:54.149 --> 28:57.141
You know why that girl
killed herself?

28:57.218 --> 28:58.583
Why?

28:58.686 --> 29:03.490
I just heard that she did it
cuz her dad took her phone away.

29:03.491 --> 29:05.759
Crazy? That makes no sense.

29:05.760 --> 29:09.563
It's true! Everyone knows
she doesn't have a cell.

29:09.564 --> 29:12.226
She always used to borrow it
to make calls.

29:12.567 --> 29:17.738
- That's just stupid.
- It's the truth!

29:17.739 --> 29:19.940
Like hell!
She was pregnant!

29:19.941 --> 29:22.109
See! I knew it!

29:22.110 --> 29:23.600
Who's the father?

29:23.711 --> 29:27.881
Not sure. But she killed herself
cuz she got pregnant.

29:27.882 --> 29:29.714
Wasn't there a will or anything?

29:31.186 --> 29:35.322
If there was, the guy's name
will be all over the school.

29:35.323 --> 29:37.451
That's true.

29:39.427 --> 29:42.328
Dead men tell no tales.
Let's just eat.

29:46.201 --> 29:48.295
Stop it, SOY!

29:48.937 --> 29:50.804
You spread the rumors, didn't you!

29:50.805 --> 29:53.399
No! Why would I?

29:57.712 --> 29:59.908
I didn't do it!

30:00.348 --> 30:02.112
Then was it you, Eu-gene?

30:02.450 --> 30:06.819
You don't trust us?
We promised to keep it a secret!

30:09.457 --> 30:11.425
Don't worry.

30:11.493 --> 30:15.259
False rumors are bound
to spread over the dead.

30:17.232 --> 30:18.597
What?

30:19.567 --> 30:21.331
There's someone there.

30:42.190 --> 30:45.759
I heard your friend was pregnant.

30:45.760 --> 30:48.923
I told you!

30:49.931 --> 30:51.265
You didn't know, either?

30:51.266 --> 30:52.825
Poor Un-joo.

30:52.934 --> 30:55.969
The guy dumped her,
then changed his number, right?

30:55.970 --> 31:01.932
That bastard!
Still, why kill herself?

31:02.277 --> 31:04.678
She should've just killed him!

31:12.186 --> 31:14.488
You spread the rumor about
my sister, didn't you!

31:14.489 --> 31:15.423
No!

31:15.424 --> 31:17.152
Don't lie!

31:17.358 --> 31:20.521
I know Un-joo was with you
on that roof!

31:22.397 --> 31:23.922
You killed her, didn't you!

31:23.998 --> 31:25.056
No!

31:25.166 --> 31:27.225
Swear on your life?

31:27.902 --> 31:29.636
Maybe Soy killed her.

31:29.637 --> 31:30.938
Why can't she say anything?

31:30.939 --> 31:34.374
I don't know what you heard,
but you got it all wrong.

31:34.375 --> 31:36.510
- Then come with me.
- Let go!

31:36.511 --> 31:40.641
Swear up on that roof!
Where my sister was!

31:40.915 --> 31:42.716
Don't do this, Jung-un!

31:42.717 --> 31:45.414
You do <i>m.</i>

31:47.355 --> 31:51.758
I searched her whole room and
found no signs of her wanting to die!

31:51.859 --> 31:53.360
Then Why'd she die?

31:53.361 --> 31:55.095
What did you do up on that roof!

31:55.096 --> 32:00.034
Stop it!
This won't bring her back!

32:02.136 --> 32:04.104
I know that!

32:07.408 --> 32:10.901
She vanished into ashes.

34:07.361 --> 34:08.760
Jung-um

34:09.897 --> 34:11.058
Jung-um

34:13.900 --> 34:15.835
<i>Jung-un, it's me.</i>

34:19.306 --> 34:20.741
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

34:21.842 --> 34:26.576
<i>I have to be with Soy.</i>

35:01.716 --> 35:04.777
Did Joo-yeon say
anything to you?

35:04.952 --> 35:06.147
No.

35:06.621 --> 35:10.922
She must've heard
we're going to the club with Ki-ho.

35:11.025 --> 35:13.494
She's dying to come with us.

35:14.295 --> 35:17.925
Still thinks she's one of us.

35:18.065 --> 35:19.692
Just ignore her.

35:20.101 --> 35:23.203
- Guess what I told her.
- What?

35:23.204 --> 35:24.467
Screw you.

35:50.832 --> 35:52.231
<i>SOY -</i>

35:56.938 --> 36:01.603
The school will be locked up
in 10 minutes.

36:01.709 --> 36:07.273
Aren't you sick of her
following you around?

36:07.648 --> 36:09.673
How close were you two last year?

36:09.784 --> 36:13.787
Not much. Especially now that
we're in different classes...

36:13.788 --> 36:15.187
What is she, your stalker?

36:15.256 --> 36:18.453
Tell her not to come around.

36:18.559 --> 36:19.856
L Will.

37:19.553 --> 37:21.385
<i>Message from Soy.</i>

37:21.489 --> 37:24.515
<i>Sorry. I forgot.
You're not still waiting, are you?</i>

37:29.530 --> 37:31.531
<i>I'm busy till next week.</i>

37:31.532 --> 37:33.466
<i>Can we meet next time?</i>

38:24.719 --> 38:26.209
You heard me!

38:26.554 --> 38:28.079
Get in the car, now!

38:45.106 --> 38:47.340
Don't you tell your mom
when things come up?

38:47.341 --> 38:50.003
Do you know
what your mom did to me!

38:50.378 --> 38:53.780
She tried to take me
to get an abortion!

38:53.781 --> 38:57.376
Then you should've went with me
when I asked!

38:57.485 --> 39:00.553
You think I wasn't ashamed
telling that to my mon!

39:00.554 --> 39:03.189
Honestly!
This is all your fault!

39:03.190 --> 39:05.492
You should've been more careful!

39:05.493 --> 39:08.690
You get pregnant and try
to blame everything on me!

39:09.830 --> 39:11.992
Shit! Class is about to start!

39:12.099 --> 39:14.363
If you need anything,
call my mom.

39:26.747 --> 39:31.947
We promised to be together forever!

39:34.255 --> 39:36.314
You don't like me anymore?

39:36.424 --> 39:39.359
You like Eu-gene and
Eun-young more?

39:39.427 --> 39:41.694
They don't suit you.

39:41.695 --> 39:44.564
It's none of your business
who I meet.

39:44.565 --> 39:47.193
Can't you understand me?

39:47.301 --> 39:50.828
I really need Eu-gene
and Eun-young right now.

39:50.938 --> 39:53.006
It's cuz of him, isn't it!

39:53.007 --> 39:55.533
You think the relationship
will last!

39:55.643 --> 39:58.704
His feelings can change,
just like yours did!

39:59.013 --> 40:01.744
If you're gonna talk like that,
don't come to me anymore!

40:03.717 --> 40:05.549
- Soy!
<i>'</i> Let go!

40:05.786 --> 40:09.154
I'm sorry.
That's not what I meant.

40:09.256 --> 40:11.156
Some friend you are!

40:11.392 --> 40:14.327
Pray for my unhappiness
why don't ya!

40:23.037 --> 40:25.802
<i>Pray for my unhappiness
why don't ya!</i>

41:50.291 --> 41:52.259
Cut the act and go!

41:52.693 --> 41:54.320
Get out!

41:54.428 --> 41:56.055
I'll only stay a few minutes.

41:56.163 --> 41:58.723
You should've been nicer
when she was alive.

41:59.633 --> 42:02.694
If you're so sorry, join her!

42:05.339 --> 42:07.330
Don't wanna die, huh!

42:08.976 --> 42:12.412
Liked taking my place and
hangin' around with Eu-gene?

42:12.980 --> 42:15.848
But you didn't see how much
that hurt Un-joo, did you!

42:15.849 --> 42:17.146
Stop it!

42:17.218 --> 42:21.052
Know why Eu-gene let you in
instead of me?

42:21.422 --> 42:23.156
To take you away from Un-joo.

42:23.157 --> 42:24.958
So she can't study and be first!

42:24.959 --> 42:26.927
That's a lie!

42:27.861 --> 42:32.230
Un-joo killed herself cuz of you!
You killed her!

42:36.237 --> 42:38.831
Stop acting like a saint!
It's sickening!

42:40.241 --> 42:42.039
Stupid bitches.

42:42.743 --> 42:46.646
They're both the same.
The losers.

43:41.535 --> 43:43.731
Think Soy could've killed her?

43:43.837 --> 43:47.296
But they were
inseparable last year!

43:47.374 --> 43:49.876
Then why's her sister so mad?

43:49.877 --> 43:52.209
Could be just crazy ideas.

43:52.780 --> 43:58.116
If Soy was really on that roof,
what do you think happened?

43:58.419 --> 44:02.588
Soy was mean to her,
but still...

44:02.589 --> 44:04.724
You never know with them...

44:04.725 --> 44:08.428
Eu-gene won't let her gang
talk to anyone else.

44:08.429 --> 44:10.863
The three of them were
in the meeting room together.

44:10.864 --> 44:14.425
And no one else saw Un-joo
besides them.

44:14.568 --> 44:17.333
So strange...

45:08.088 --> 45:11.217
I told you not to worry.

45:11.592 --> 45:13.959
I'll take care of it.

45:14.061 --> 45:16.291
You just study.

45:17.030 --> 45:18.361
Did you have lunch?

45:19.833 --> 45:21.699
That's good.

45:21.835 --> 45:24.930
I'm almost at her school.
Gotta go.

45:25.773 --> 45:29.903
Mommy loves you, too.

46:35.709 --> 46:38.679
- Cut it straight!
- Then hold still!

46:41.315 --> 46:42.915
I don't get it!

46:42.916 --> 46:45.317
Stop thinking about that!

46:45.419 --> 46:49.049
Un-joo's sister said
she was misunderstood!

46:49.156 --> 46:51.386
No! I smell something fishy!

46:51.492 --> 46:54.086
- Like hell.
- You'll see.

46:54.194 --> 46:58.927
KIM Eun-young!
Tell us the truth!

46:59.500 --> 47:02.935
Were you really in the meeting room
when she died?

47:02.936 --> 47:03.970
Of course!

47:03.971 --> 47:08.238
Then what about what Jung-un said?
Who's telling the truth?

47:08.308 --> 47:11.801
Something bad happened
with you and her, didn't it!

47:11.879 --> 47:12.846
Did you fight?

47:12.847 --> 47:14.871
Why would we fight with her?

47:16.984 --> 47:22.252
Actually, Soy was up on the roof
with Un-joo.

47:22.456 --> 47:23.523
Really?

47:23.524 --> 47:25.691
- What did they do up there?
- Tell us!

47:25.692 --> 47:28.160
I think they were
both going to do it,

47:28.161 --> 47:29.662
but only Un-joo ended up dead.

47:29.663 --> 47:32.198
- Why did they want to die?
- Why?

47:32.199 --> 47:36.033
Don't ask me!
Go ask Soy!

47:46.680 --> 47:48.170
What's wrong?

47:49.483 --> 47:50.917
LEE Un-joo.

47:53.253 --> 47:54.687
What the...

48:08.335 --> 48:09.928
What happened?

48:10.871 --> 48:11.997
Eun-young?

48:13.340 --> 48:15.809
I saw Un-joo in the bathroom.

48:16.076 --> 48:18.135
That's just your imagination.

48:19.746 --> 48:21.373
No, it was real!

48:21.648 --> 48:24.174
Her clothes were soaked in blood!

48:24.284 --> 48:25.809
Her face...

48:28.121 --> 48:31.216
She's there!
Un-joo's there!

48:55.482 --> 48:58.144
It's Un-joo! It's her!

48:58.919 --> 49:01.388
Un-joo's not there!

49:04.458 --> 49:05.958
I saw her! I swear!

49:05.959 --> 49:08.121
Un-joo is dead!

49:09.162 --> 49:10.994
Why don't you believe me?

49:31.151 --> 49:32.482
Soy...

49:34.021 --> 49:36.115
Why'd you come this time?

49:36.256 --> 49:38.691
Think putting your hair down
like Un-joo will scare me?

49:38.692 --> 49:41.527
Un-joo sent you to torture us,
didn't she!

49:41.528 --> 49:42.928
Stop it, Eun-young!

49:42.929 --> 49:45.898
Say it! Why are you here!

49:45.899 --> 49:48.368
Stop it, Eun-young!

49:58.211 --> 50:00.839
- Stop it!
- Let go! I'm going to the teacher.

50:00.947 --> 50:02.948
I'll go with you, Eun-young.

50:02.949 --> 50:05.518
Get away!
She's like this cuz of you!

50:05.519 --> 50:07.687
I didn't do anything...

50:07.688 --> 50:09.655
You told Un-joo's sister to come!

50:09.656 --> 50:10.823
What?

50:10.824 --> 50:13.693
Just like you called
Un-joo to come that day!

50:13.694 --> 50:16.220
Why are you doing this!

50:23.637 --> 50:25.799
Stop it Jung-un, please!

50:26.773 --> 50:27.641
YOON Soy.

50:27.642 --> 50:30.110
Just take her and go.

50:30.210 --> 50:33.612
You're making it difficult
for all of us.

50:33.613 --> 50:34.842
Ell-gene!

50:34.915 --> 50:38.784
Tell us what happened
when you went up there with her!

50:38.785 --> 50:40.019
What are you saying?

50:40.020 --> 50:42.621
You said the same thing to me
at the funeral yesterday.

50:42.622 --> 50:45.057
Why'd you do it?
Why'd you lie?

50:45.058 --> 50:47.117
Stop making up lies and go!

51:18.592 --> 51:20.287
Finished washing up?

51:29.836 --> 51:32.237
- What's with you?
- It was Un-joo.

51:32.539 --> 51:36.709
Her face was cracked
and bloody all over!

51:36.710 --> 51:38.678
Un-joo is dead!

51:38.745 --> 51:41.271
But she's back!

51:42.582 --> 51:45.184
Un-joo knows everything.

51:45.185 --> 51:50.146
You realize everything you didn't
when you die, right?

51:51.925 --> 51:56.795
That's why Un-joo came back.
To take you and me.

52:00.000 --> 52:01.365
Open up!

52:01.501 --> 52:03.902
Un-joo won't find you, here.

52:04.004 --> 52:08.339
I won't say anything!
I won't tell Soy!

52:08.508 --> 52:10.340
I won't tell anyone!

52:10.410 --> 52:13.045
If you say you want to leave
school early cuz of Un-joo's ghost...

52:13.046 --> 52:15.347
what will they think of us!

52:15.348 --> 52:17.249
I promise! I swear!

52:17.250 --> 52:20.686
No! Stay here till
school finishes.

52:20.787 --> 52:22.881
Why are you doing this!

52:27.727 --> 52:29.525
Cuz you're crazy.

52:29.963 --> 52:32.125
Eu-gene! Eu-gene!

52:32.699 --> 52:34.793
Don't go! Eu-gene!

53:18.011 --> 53:19.410
<i>LEE Eu-gene</i>

53:40.800 --> 53:42.290
Is that you, Eu-gene?

53:45.005 --> 53:46.803
Eu-gene! Eu-gene!

55:23.269 --> 55:25.004
How'd you get out?

55:25.005 --> 55:27.201
Un-joo opened it.

55:27.574 --> 55:29.042
Unioo?

55:29.209 --> 55:32.235
I told you she came back.

55:32.512 --> 55:35.481
I told Un-joo everything.

55:35.482 --> 55:37.246
Snap out of it, Eun-young!

55:38.485 --> 55:41.455
It's not too late
to confess everything!

55:41.554 --> 55:46.025
If we say we're sorry and confess,
she said nothing will happen.

55:46.026 --> 55:49.728
What are you saying!
This all happened cuz of Soy!

55:49.729 --> 55:52.426
I did everything you wanted!

55:54.367 --> 55:58.326
Please, Eu-gene.
Just this once! Please!

55:58.438 --> 56:01.271
Let's do what I want,
just this once!

56:01.408 --> 56:03.809
Or else, I'll die.

56:05.011 --> 56:06.645
Un-joo will kill you, too.

56:06.646 --> 56:08.580
Un-joo died cuz of Soy!

56:45.685 --> 56:49.553
Eu-gene! Eun-young!

56:52.692 --> 56:54.285
LEE Eu-gene!

57:25.492 --> 57:26.891
Eun-young!

57:29.696 --> 57:31.289
No, Eun-young!

57:35.001 --> 57:36.298
Eun-young!

57:41.908 --> 57:45.674
I'm not scared, anymore.

57:45.778 --> 57:48.770
Un-joo said she'll stay with me.

57:49.749 --> 57:51.217
You know...

57:53.086 --> 57:57.648
How much I wanted to die
every time my dad hit me.

57:58.625 --> 58:03.256
I wanted to die, but was scared.

58:07.767 --> 58:11.169
I don't have to go
to that shitty house anymore.

58:18.278 --> 58:20.246
I'm so happy, now.

59:14.300 --> 59:15.665
Go back to class!

59:40.593 --> 59:43.619
Say something, Soy.

01:00:22.935 --> 01:00:24.494
Looking for the key?

01:00:29.542 --> 01:00:31.306
Why do you have that!

01:00:31.411 --> 01:00:33.345
Cuz it belongs to my sister!

01:00:38.151 --> 01:00:43.188
The four of you were all there!
Why'd you say only Soy was with her!

01:00:43.189 --> 01:00:45.681
Who said we were all there!

01:00:47.527 --> 01:00:49.291
Un-joo did.

01:00:49.896 --> 01:00:52.297
I just told the truth.

01:00:53.499 --> 01:00:56.400
How long will you
keep up the lies!

01:00:58.338 --> 01:01:01.000
Aren't you sorry
to the girls who died?

01:01:02.475 --> 01:01:04.273
What do you want from me?

01:01:05.678 --> 01:01:09.114
Want me to jump from Student Hall
like Eun-young?

01:01:11.884 --> 01:01:14.319
Is that what you want?

01:01:15.655 --> 01:01:17.487
Tell the truth.

01:01:36.476 --> 01:01:40.140
Stupid Un-joo
died instead of Soy.

01:01:42.248 --> 01:01:44.216
That's the truth.

01:03:14.474 --> 01:03:15.873
<i>SOY -</i>

01:03:16.409 --> 01:03:17.740
Why are you here?

01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:19.105
I'm sorry.

01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:27.647
I lied cuz I was afraid
people would find out I was there.

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:29.620
Eun-young killed herself.

01:03:30.623 --> 01:03:32.523
Un-joo killed her.

01:03:34.227 --> 01:03:37.891
No. Un-joo would never do
such a thing!

01:03:38.097 --> 01:03:42.432
Un-joo is dead!
She's not the same girl you knew!

01:03:44.270 --> 01:03:46.398
I'll be the next to die.

01:03:47.974 --> 01:03:49.533
Or you.

01:03:52.078 --> 01:03:54.046
Let's go to the church, Soy

01:03:54.514 --> 01:03:59.850
Let's go and ask
Un-joo and Eun-young to forgive us.

01:04:01.854 --> 01:04:03.379
Soy...

01:05:09.021 --> 01:05:10.420
Ell-gene!

01:05:12.124 --> 01:05:16.288
Know why I asked you
to commit suicide together?

01:05:16.596 --> 01:05:18.223
What are you talking about?

01:05:18.297 --> 01:05:20.163
It's cuz of you!

01:05:22.068 --> 01:05:26.437
My grades fell and I lost the key
all cuz of you!

01:05:26.806 --> 01:05:29.867
At this rate, I won't get into
the college I want!

01:05:32.878 --> 01:05:35.813
I was such a happy person.

01:05:37.316 --> 01:05:39.944
Everything's ruined cuz of you!

01:05:40.653 --> 01:05:43.384
Why should I be unhappy
cuz of you?

01:05:45.124 --> 01:05:48.754
If I don't place first this time,
I'll kill myself.

01:05:48.828 --> 01:05:50.592
You crazy!

01:05:54.100 --> 01:06:00.267
It's a hassle having the church key,
but I don't want to give it up.

01:06:00.539 --> 01:06:03.770
Then I'd be losing it
to someone who beats me.

01:06:08.414 --> 01:06:11.145
I'd rather die, then to lose.

01:06:11.484 --> 01:06:13.782
Committing suicide is no joke.

01:06:13.853 --> 01:06:15.981
You don't understand me.

01:06:16.522 --> 01:06:19.253
I tried to kill myself last year.

01:06:23.162 --> 01:06:25.824
You know my father.

01:06:30.269 --> 01:06:38.199
I bought a bunch of Soju and
sleeping pills and went up on my roof.

01:06:39.412 --> 01:06:42.746
I was going to drink
and jump off!

01:06:43.582 --> 01:06:46.384
I stood on the ledge after
two bottles,

01:06:46.385 --> 01:06:49.218
then suddenly came to my senses.

01:06:49.555 --> 01:06:52.354
I was too scared to do it alone.

01:06:55.528 --> 01:06:57.223
I'm pregnant.

01:06:57.797 --> 01:06:59.265
What?

01:06:59.365 --> 01:07:01.166
What did you just say?

01:07:01.167 --> 01:07:03.033
I'm pregnant.

01:07:06.338 --> 01:07:08.238
Should I kill myself?

01:07:11.310 --> 01:07:13.438
I want to die.

01:07:16.515 --> 01:07:19.849
Should we ask Soy
to commit suicide together?

01:07:20.886 --> 01:07:22.718
I don't want to die.

01:07:23.289 --> 01:07:25.189
We're not!

01:07:25.291 --> 01:07:28.989
You and I will
just pretend we are.

01:07:29.395 --> 01:07:33.229
That's crazy!
We can't do that.

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:37.602
Let's say we'll jump off
Student Hall together.

01:07:37.603 --> 01:07:39.537
Stop talking like that!

01:07:39.538 --> 01:07:43.808
We'll first make a pledge
to commit suicide together.

01:07:43.809 --> 01:07:47.677
Is it cuz of Ki-ho?

01:07:54.353 --> 01:07:59.257
But then you and I won't jump.

01:08:00.092 --> 01:08:03.892
You're not serious, are you?

01:08:08.734 --> 01:08:11.795
Innocent Un-joo died cuz of you!

01:08:11.871 --> 01:08:14.272
And Eun-young died
cuz she wasn't?

01:08:17.676 --> 01:08:19.508
You killed Eun-young, too!

01:08:19.645 --> 01:08:20.678
No!

01:08:20.679 --> 01:08:22.013
It's all cuz of you!

01:08:22.014 --> 01:08:24.415
Cuz you're pregnant
with Ki-ho's baby!

01:08:26.452 --> 01:08:28.019
Not everything is my fault!

01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:30.113
Like you didn't do anything wrong!

01:08:30.622 --> 01:08:33.216
My life is ruined cuz of you!

01:08:33.526 --> 01:08:36.587
Did you ever think of
how much you hurt me?

01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:46.466
Know how happy I was
when you said you wanted to die?

01:08:49.875 --> 01:08:54.243
If you're dead,
Ki-ho will come back to me!

01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:14.421
Now, you can join Un-joo.

01:09:50.935 --> 01:09:53.701
I'm just doing her a favor
by killing you!

01:10:02.681 --> 01:10:04.479
So die!

01:10:05.918 --> 01:10:08.649
You'll be the third student
to kill herself!

01:10:18.130 --> 01:10:19.564
LEE Eu-gene!

01:10:43.188 --> 01:10:45.953
Who are you!
Un-joo or Jung-un!

01:11:10.482 --> 01:11:12.644
I didn't do anything wrong!

01:11:13.252 --> 01:11:14.947
It's all cuz of Soy!

01:11:15.087 --> 01:11:18.148
Cuz she stole Ki-ho from me!

01:11:19.959 --> 01:11:22.428
Un-joo! No!

01:11:25.364 --> 01:11:29.858
Eu-gene is right.
It's cuz of me, you died.

01:11:46.418 --> 01:11:50.286
See! Soy says I'm right!
I don't want to die!

01:11:50.990 --> 01:11:52.389
Un-joo!

01:11:53.425 --> 01:11:55.359
Stop it.

01:12:00.366 --> 01:12:03.401
Soy's the one
who wanted to die, first!

01:12:03.402 --> 01:12:07.805
This is all her fault!
So kill her instead!

01:12:19.918 --> 01:12:23.149
Tell her, Soy!

01:15:22.968 --> 01:15:25.937
I wanted to come to you
every morning...

01:15:25.938 --> 01:15:28.839
But I was scared
you won't forgive me.

01:15:29.074 --> 01:15:31.634
I have no right to be angry.

01:15:31.743 --> 01:15:36.374
I hurt you by what I said
about that guy.

01:15:36.682 --> 01:15:40.550
No, it's all cuz of me.
It's not your fault.

01:15:40.953 --> 01:15:43.285
Stop crying-

01:15:43.889 --> 01:15:47.792
I knew you'd come back to me.

01:15:49.261 --> 01:15:52.788
We can go back
to the way things were.

01:15:53.599 --> 01:15:55.499
No, we can't.

01:15:55.701 --> 01:15:58.568
Of course we can.

01:16:01.206 --> 01:16:05.302
I'm pregnant.
I'm going to kill myself.

01:16:05.377 --> 01:16:07.641
You'll keep it a secret, right?

01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:10.147
NO, Soy!

01:16:10.148 --> 01:16:12.717
Promise you won't tell anyone.

01:16:12.718 --> 01:16:14.880
You can't die Soy!

01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:20.790
I liked you
from the first day we met.

01:16:20.993 --> 01:16:22.893
I'll never forget you.

01:16:22.995 --> 01:16:27.296
Think it over.
There's gotta be another way!

01:16:29.001 --> 01:16:33.063
An unwanted baby
is better off not being born.

01:16:34.806 --> 01:16:37.571
I have to die with the baby.

01:16:37.676 --> 01:16:40.278
Please, don't do this!

01:16:40.279 --> 01:16:43.214
Today's the day
I promised to kill myself.

01:16:44.249 --> 01:16:46.183
That's why I came.

01:16:46.485 --> 01:16:50.115
I wanted to tell you
and say goodbye.

01:17:28.527 --> 01:17:30.586
Jung-un. It's me.

01:17:33.865 --> 01:17:35.424
I'm sorry.

01:17:36.435 --> 01:17:41.373
But I have to be with Soy.

01:17:43.141 --> 01:17:49.239
When you hear this,
I'll already be dead.

01:17:50.816 --> 01:17:54.878
Don't be sad or hate Soy.

01:17:55.887 --> 01:17:59.915
I'm happy to be able to
die with Soy.

01:18:01.393 --> 01:18:05.796
We promised to be together forever.

01:18:07.999 --> 01:18:10.331
I love you, little sister.

01:18:36.695 --> 01:18:38.527
Un-joo!

01:18:38.930 --> 01:18:44.198
I came to die with you girls.
So don't blame Soy.

01:18:44.302 --> 01:18:49.263
No way!
Let's talk about this.

01:18:49.875 --> 01:18:53.175
Don't do this Un-joo!
Why would you die!

01:18:54.813 --> 01:18:57.145
Why do you want to die?

01:18:58.583 --> 01:19:02.952
Cuz I promised my best friend
that I'd die with her.

01:19:03.221 --> 01:19:05.087
Who might that be?

01:19:09.194 --> 01:19:11.288
Please, don't do this.

01:21:38.810 --> 01:21:40.175
One.

01:21:40.579 --> 01:21:41.842
Two.

01:21:42.380 --> 01:21:43.575
Three.

01:22:27.258 --> 01:22:28.851
I'm so sorry.

01:22:41.306 --> 01:22:43.775
I missed you so much.

01:22:44.009 --> 01:22:48.003
But I didn't want to scare you...

01:22:48.913 --> 01:22:50.506
I'm sorry.

01:22:50.682 --> 01:22:52.810
I'm so sorry, Un-joo.

01:22:53.518 --> 01:22:56.010
I won't let you feel lonely again.

01:22:58.123 --> 01:23:01.855
Now, we can be together forever.

01:23:03.561 --> 01:23:05.290
So warm...

01:23:41.399 --> 01:23:43.993
I won't be coming back, again.

01:23:45.336 --> 01:23:47.236
Take me with you.

01:23:52.010 --> 01:23:54.342
Please take care of my sister.

01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:58.573
You're Jung-un's sister, now.
