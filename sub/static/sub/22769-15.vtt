she has everything

10:39.080 --> 10:41.040
the security company
was working on.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.080
Honey Lemon:
She hasn't escaped yet!

10:42.080 --> 10:43.620
No one outruns Go Go.

10:51.330 --> 10:53.120
(grunting)

10:57.210 --> 10:59.040
(groans)

11:03.120 --> 11:06.000
Ugh. She outran me.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
(indistinct chatter)

11:08.000 --> 11:11.040
-KheartsQT just posted
chapter three.
-(Hiro groans)

11:11.040 --> 11:13.080
I stayed up
all night last night
rereading chapter two.

11:14.830 --> 11:16.620
Girl:
I'm so in love
with Captain Cutie.

11:16.620 --> 11:18.000
Do you think any of this
actually happened?

11:18.000 --> 11:19.670
Obviously,
it's on the Internet.

11:19.670 --> 11:21.920
Captain Cutie
must be so handsome!

11:21.920 --> 11:23.420
Karmi is so lucky!

11:23.420 --> 11:25.120
Girl:
Is it "Kar-mutie"
or "Cute-armie?"

11:25.120 --> 11:27.080
Either way,
they're so cute!

11:27.080 --> 11:28.750
I totally 'ship
"Kar-mutie."

11:28.750 --> 11:30.000
Boy:
"Kar-mutie's" the best!

11:30.000 --> 11:31.920
Karmi and Captain Cutie
forever!

11:31.920 --> 11:33.420
-Girl: I'm so jealous!
-Boy: I know!

11:33.420 --> 11:35.920
Students (chanting):
Kar-mutie! Kar-mutie! Kar-mutie!

11:35.920 --> 11:38.830
(chanting continues)

11:38.830 --> 11:39.960
Aah!

11:42.460 --> 11:43.960
What's up
with that kid?

11:45.330 --> 11:47.290
So, I steam up the pond,

11:47.290 --> 11:48.920
and you freeze up the steam.

11:48.920 --> 11:50.120
Uh, Freddie?

11:54.210 --> 11:55.380
So, I steam up the pond,

11:55.380 --> 11:57.170
and now you freeze up
the steam.

11:57.170 --> 11:59.290
That's the plan.
Ready, Freddie?

11:59.290 --> 12:01.080
Born ready, HL.

12:06.790 --> 12:08.170
(ice crackling)

12:10.670 --> 12:12.250
(groans)

12:12.250 --> 12:13.330
Sorry!

12:13.330 --> 12:14.670
Making Fred-sicles?

12:14.670 --> 12:16.250
We thought since
Karmi got it right

12:16.250 --> 12:17.460
about Go Go's
vertical skating,

12:17.460 --> 12:18.670
maybe she was onto something

12:18.670 --> 12:21.040
about Fred and I being able
to make ice showers too.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.330
(shivering)
So far, it--
it is not working.

12:23.330 --> 12:24.500
But we're not giving up!

12:24.500 --> 12:26.120
The Go Go thing was--

12:26.120 --> 12:28.080
it was a lucky guess!

12:28.080 --> 12:31.120
Hiro, maybe it
would be easier

12:31.120 --> 12:33.210
if you just accepted the fact
that Karmi has a crush on you.

12:33.210 --> 12:34.500
And then you can
appreciate

12:34.500 --> 12:36.040
she has something
to contribute.

12:36.040 --> 12:38.960
Yeah, besides,
it's not like you can
get her to stop writing.

12:38.960 --> 12:40.830
Oh, that's it!

12:40.830 --> 12:42.170
Karmi might not listen to me,

12:42.170 --> 12:44.790
but I know someone
she will listen to.

12:44.790 --> 12:46.250
(deep voice)
You see, Karmi,

12:46.250 --> 12:48.040
you've gotten too much
about us right.

12:48.040 --> 12:50.750
My name is Captain Cutie.

12:50.750 --> 12:53.540
Captain Jeff Cutie.

12:53.540 --> 12:55.670
And my team...

12:55.670 --> 12:58.420
can't risk you exposing
any more of our secrets.

12:58.420 --> 12:59.880
"Jeff"?

12:59.880 --> 13:02.210
-(normal voice)
Would "Carl" work better?
-Mm-mm.

13:02.210 --> 13:05.040
(deep voice)
Listen, Karmi, you're
not a very good writer.

13:05.040 --> 13:07.000
It'd be better
if you just stopped.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.250
Harsh, and that's
coming from me.

13:09.250 --> 13:12.080
Karmi, Captain Cutie here.

13:12.080 --> 13:13.580
Are you familiar
with the phrase

13:13.580 --> 13:15.210
"copyright infringement"?

13:15.210 --> 13:18.080
Because my lawyer here
is prepared to take action.

13:18.080 --> 13:19.120
Legal action.

13:19.120 --> 13:23.170
Mmm, I'm just not sure anyone
would buy Baymax as a lawyer.

13:23.170 --> 13:26.170
-(whispers) Say your line.
-Baymax: I object.

13:26.170 --> 13:28.580
Karmi gets out
of the Bio Lab at 7:00,

13:28.580 --> 13:30.290
every night.

13:30.290 --> 13:31.920
So, where is she?

13:31.920 --> 13:33.920
-Wasabi (on comm):
How do you know that?
-Not the point!

13:33.920 --> 13:36.210
(sighs)
She's probably
writing chapter four.

13:36.210 --> 13:38.880
Honey Lemon (on comm):
Hiro, you're gonna
wanna see this.

13:38.880 --> 13:42.580
Captain Cutie, meet me
at Akuma Island by nine o'clock

13:42.580 --> 13:46.250
or you'll never see your
beautiful girlfriend again.

13:46.250 --> 13:48.040
(grunts)
Let me go!

13:48.040 --> 13:49.540
That's Krei's old lab.

13:49.540 --> 13:51.580
It's set to be demolished
tonight. Karmi needs us.

14:01.500 --> 14:03.170

we're coming.

all of us if we split up.

14:05.420 --> 14:08.250
Whoever gets to Karmi first,
signal the others.

14:08.250 --> 14:10.330
Good lucky everyone,
and watch out.

14:10.330 --> 14:12.920
Hands in!
Group cheer time!

14:14.670 --> 14:17.000
Yeah, okay, good.
We'll save the group
cheer for after.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.170
Good plan.

Just a little further,

14:31.830 --> 14:34.290

to cut our way inside.

14:36.710 --> 14:38.330
We should be far enough.

14:39.380 --> 14:42.960
(sizzling)

14:46.000 --> 14:47.210
Can you do that any faster?

14:47.210 --> 14:49.790
Look, it doesn't have
to be a perfect circle.

14:49.790 --> 14:52.750
Oh, I'd need a lot more tools
to make a perfect circle.

14:52.750 --> 14:55.620

going to say to you.

15:49.830 --> 15:51.290
(screaming)

15:53.040 --> 15:55.420
Maybe we can use the old
security system to find Karmi.

15:55.420 --> 15:58.170
-It appears
to still be functional.
-(electronic beeping)

15:59.710 --> 16:00.920
Hiro:
There she is.

16:00.920 --> 16:02.460
No sign of Momakase.

16:02.460 --> 16:05.250
There is also
no sign of the others.

16:11.170 --> 16:12.460

16:26.620 --> 16:28.330
Welcome, Captain Cutie.

16:28.330 --> 16:30.540
What a good boyfriend you are.

16:30.540 --> 16:31.750
I'm not--
(clears throat)

16:31.750 --> 16:33.710
(deep voice)
I mean, you're not
getting away with this.

16:33.710 --> 16:35.420
-I'd say I already have.
-(beeps)

16:35.420 --> 16:38.290
(whirring)

16:38.290 --> 16:39.290
Not bad.

16:39.290 --> 16:40.460
To trap all six of you,

16:40.460 --> 16:42.420
I actually had
to break a sweat.

16:42.420 --> 16:43.960
That's not all
you're going to break.

16:43.960 --> 16:46.170
(grunts, groans)

16:46.170 --> 16:47.620
Honey Lemon:
The bars aren't
the only way out.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.040
(sizzling)

16:51.040 --> 16:53.420
This cell was designed
specifically for you.

16:53.420 --> 16:54.880
I thought of everything.

16:54.880 --> 16:56.790
You mean, Obake
thought of everything.

16:56.790 --> 16:59.500
His intel.
The ideas are all me.

16:59.500 --> 17:01.960
What exactly do you guys
call yourselves?

17:01.960 --> 17:03.540
Is it "Oba-kase?"

17:03.540 --> 17:04.920
My money's on
"Moma-bake" personally.

17:04.920 --> 17:07.380
Stupid last words.

17:07.380 --> 17:09.380
A disintegration device
is about to wipe out

17:09.380 --> 17:11.380
everything on this island.

17:11.380 --> 17:14.710
Was it worth it to reunite
with your girlfriend?

17:14.710 --> 17:16.420
-She called me
your girlfriend!
-(alarm blares)

17:16.420 --> 17:19.250
-Robotic Voice (over intercom):
Prepare for disintegration.
-That's my cue.

17:22.460 --> 17:25.830
Well, if no one else
is going to say it...

17:25.830 --> 17:27.420
(Wasabi screams)

17:27.420 --> 17:30.790
-Big Hero 6 is trapped.
-Obake (over comm):
Perfect.

17:30.790 --> 17:33.210
I thought you had
plans for the boy.

17:33.210 --> 17:35.420
Obake:
If he's good enough,
he'll survive.

17:36.500 --> 17:39.040
Fred:
Okay, we're locked in
a super high-tech prison cell,

17:39.040 --> 17:40.460
made especially to contain us,

17:40.460 --> 17:42.500
and the building is
about to be disintegrated.

17:42.500 --> 17:44.460
-But?
-Oh, there's no "but."

17:44.460 --> 17:46.040
I'm just stating
the facts here.

17:46.040 --> 17:47.920
-This isn't good.
-Oh, boy.

17:47.920 --> 17:50.380
When you say it's not good,
it's really not good.

17:50.380 --> 17:52.080
You guys know
another way out, right?

17:53.670 --> 17:55.330
Right?!

17:55.330 --> 17:56.500
Actually, I do.

17:57.750 --> 18:00.460
Red Panda, engage
Overdrive Mode.

18:00.460 --> 18:01.920
(warbling)

18:01.920 --> 18:03.580
Baymax:
My body is changing.

18:16.960 --> 18:19.620
Overdrive Mode engaged.

18:19.620 --> 18:21.250
What?

18:21.250 --> 18:23.790
Overdrive Mode,
from my story! It's real!

18:23.790 --> 18:24.880
After-- (clears throat)

18:24.880 --> 18:26.920
(deep voice)
After I heard
Karmi's story,

18:26.920 --> 18:28.670
I made a few tweaks
to the armor.

18:28.670 --> 18:31.170
It'll drain his
battery really quickly,
but it's enough to...

18:35.250 --> 18:37.580
(crackling)

18:38.580 --> 18:40.380
(booming)

18:41.670 --> 18:43.540
...do that.

18:45.710 --> 18:47.620
Baymax (slurring):
I did the thing!

18:47.620 --> 18:49.540
Robotic Voice:
Disintegration
in four minutes.

18:49.540 --> 18:50.750
We've gotta go.

18:50.750 --> 18:52.250
Can you fly us out,
Red Panda?

18:52.250 --> 18:55.000
(slurring)
I can walk
through anything!

18:55.000 --> 18:56.420
That's a no.

18:56.420 --> 18:58.500
Uh, Chop Chop,
grab Red Panda.

18:58.500 --> 19:00.620
-(Wasabi yells)
-Baymax: Hey, Chop Chop.

19:00.620 --> 19:02.460
Hiro:
Karmi.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.290
Follow me.

19:06.460 --> 19:08.330
This is so cool!

19:08.330 --> 19:09.710
Robotic Voice:
Disintegration
in two minutes.

19:09.710 --> 19:11.170
Goodbye, Akuma Island!

19:15.500 --> 19:17.380
-(explosion)
-(alarms blaring)

19:20.920 --> 19:22.170
(quietly) Say your line,
Chop Chop.

19:23.330 --> 19:27.000
Oh, yeah.
Time to make chop chop!

19:29.120 --> 19:30.920
-Karmi: Should we swim?
-Hiro: Not enough time.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.210
Ready,
Flame Jumper?

19:32.210 --> 19:33.460
Ready,
Tall Girl.

19:33.460 --> 19:36.170
If you want to rethink my name,
I think I'd be okay with that.

19:36.170 --> 19:38.420
Fred:
Things are about
to get muy caliente.

19:40.710 --> 19:41.920
Can't teach tall!

19:41.920 --> 19:44.540
(ice crackling)

19:46.500 --> 19:48.920
We should talk about
the catchphrase too.

19:48.920 --> 19:50.330
(Fred screams)

19:51.620 --> 19:52.880
(screaming)

19:54.420 --> 19:56.250
Baymax:
Buildings go bye-bye.

20:01.500 --> 20:04.000
(screaming)

20:09.710 --> 20:11.750
Honeyzilla
saves the day!

20:11.750 --> 20:13.540
-Honeyzilla?
-Oh, that's what
we'd be called

20:13.540 --> 20:15.500
if there were people
'shipping us.

20:15.500 --> 20:17.120
I've got them
for everyone on the team.

20:17.120 --> 20:19.710
"Gogosabi,
Fredsabi, Honeysabi."

20:19.710 --> 20:21.710
I'm banking on Wasabi
being a fan favorite.

20:21.710 --> 20:23.500
I mean, look at him.
He's so cool.

20:23.500 --> 20:25.540
(grunts)

20:25.540 --> 20:28.380
I can't believe you created
Overdrive Mode because of me.

20:28.380 --> 20:31.580
That's right.
You're really the one that
saved the day back there.

20:32.830 --> 20:35.920
So then,
you liked my story.

20:35.920 --> 20:38.920
Yeah, about that, Karmi.

20:38.920 --> 20:41.920
I've been meaning
to say to you, uh, that...

20:45.790 --> 20:48.920
(clears throat)
As long as there's
a Captain Cutie,

20:48.920 --> 20:51.210
there will always
be justice.

(squeals, giggles)

20:53.790 --> 20:56.750
This is the best day ever!

20:56.750 --> 20:58.380
(laughs)

21:01.710 --> 21:04.540

And so our heroes
saved the day.

21:07.080 --> 21:08.750

21:25.330 --> 21:26.790

21:26.790 --> 21:28.790
-I don't want to hear anymore.
-(laughing) What?

21:28.790 --> 21:30.750

21:30.750 --> 21:32.000
