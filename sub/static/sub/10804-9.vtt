WEBVTT

00:19.145 --> 00:21.189
All right, watch your head.

00:24.192 --> 00:28.655
Inmate 5-5-4-6-7.
Fisk, Wilson.

00:32.534 --> 00:35.620
Everything off.
Clothing and personal items in the bin.

01:27.171 --> 01:28.923
Newbies wear white.

01:30.008 --> 01:31.467
That's yours.

02:00.579 --> 02:02.624
I deeply regret that
it's come to this, Mr. Fisk.

02:03.457 --> 02:06.252
I assure you my firm
did everything we could...

02:06.335 --> 02:09.881
but the case against you was,
quite simply, bulletproof.

02:10.840 --> 02:15.136
How is the progress
regarding my appeal, Mr. Donovan?

02:16.054 --> 02:18.848
We're making progress,
but I have to be honest.

02:18.932 --> 02:20.725
Given the magnitude of charges,

02:20.809 --> 02:22.185
we were lucky we could
plead you out at all.

02:23.602 --> 02:25.063
Vanessa, huh?

02:26.272 --> 02:29.400
I've secured a percentage of your
holdings offshore, as requested.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.779
-She wants to come see you.
-She can't.

02:32.862 --> 02:35.531
She must stay where she's safe
for the time being.

02:35.614 --> 02:39.077
Of course.
She'll have everything she needs.

02:39.160 --> 02:42.080
But with that said, you need to understand

02:42.163 --> 02:45.750
that a good number of your assets
were seized by the government, Mr. Fisk.

02:45.834 --> 02:48.127
Your remaining capital is... limited.

02:49.503 --> 02:52.966
-How long will she be safe for?
-Long enough.

02:53.049 --> 02:57.428
Mr. Fisk, I'm doing everything I can
to get you out,

02:57.511 --> 03:01.015
but we're talking about a process
that could take months, maybe years.

03:02.100 --> 03:04.769
In the interim, we need you
to keep your head down

03:04.853 --> 03:07.021
and avoid trouble while you're in here.

03:07.105 --> 03:10.775
The state will jump on any infraction
to shoot down an early release...

03:10.859 --> 03:12.443
to keep you inside.

03:13.361 --> 03:15.446
It's the best move, Mr. Fisk.

03:16.364 --> 03:18.157
In fact, it's the only move.

03:26.457 --> 03:30.628
Those you cannot teach to fly,
teach to fall faster.

03:37.010 --> 03:38.427
Wilson Fisk.

03:39.012 --> 03:40.847
The boogeyman of crime.

03:40.930 --> 03:43.599
The man who cast a shadow in the dark.

03:47.103 --> 03:49.688
You'll stop reading those eventually.

03:50.606 --> 03:54.068
It's best to accept that real life
is what happens on the inside.

03:54.152 --> 03:56.612
Maybe your life, Mr. Dutton, not mine.

03:56.695 --> 04:00.909
-We never met before, have we?
-No, but your reputation precedes you.

04:01.659 --> 04:05.496
A life of running drugs
buys you that much in New York City.

04:06.664 --> 04:10.459
You may have made a name
for yourself on the outside...

04:10.543 --> 04:11.753
but I run the big box.

04:12.420 --> 04:14.588
I just wanna make that clear...

04:14.672 --> 04:16.966
in case you get any ideas
about stepping up.

04:17.801 --> 04:20.887
-I have no intentions of doing that.
-Cut the shit, fat man.

04:21.763 --> 04:25.767
I've known guys like you my whole life.
I killed most of 'em.

04:25.850 --> 04:28.144
You ain't never seen a throne
you didn't wanna sit in.

04:28.227 --> 04:31.230
So I'm here to make myself crystal clear.

04:31.314 --> 04:33.149
There's only room
for one of us in this prison,

04:33.232 --> 04:35.568
and it ain't gonna be you.
Not ever.

04:35.651 --> 04:37.528
Because I'm the kingpin of this bitch.

04:40.782 --> 04:42.366
Catch you later.

05:10.937 --> 05:12.605
Mind if I sit?

05:14.148 --> 05:15.399
Fine.

05:16.567 --> 05:19.528
I won't bother you.
Just wanted to meet.

05:20.446 --> 05:23.032
You know, in here,
guys like us need to stick together.

05:24.658 --> 05:25.994
Guys like us?

05:26.828 --> 05:29.205
I was a mortgage analyst on the outside.

05:29.288 --> 05:32.666
Seven figure salary,
summer house in the Hamptons.

05:32.750 --> 05:34.460
Just made the wrong deal,
crossed the wrong guy.

05:35.211 --> 05:38.923
It turned out that his brother was
some bigwig in the Justice Department.

05:39.007 --> 05:42.093
Some luck, huh?
Look, what I mean is...

05:43.011 --> 05:45.013
we're not like these savages in here.
That's all.

05:52.145 --> 05:53.729
Smart to steer clear of that asshole.

05:54.480 --> 05:56.815
It's not just the guys at his table
that are on his side.

05:56.900 --> 06:00.069
He runs about 80%
of the contraband in this place.

06:00.153 --> 06:02.363
Most of the guards are in his pocket,
from what I can tell.

06:04.991 --> 06:07.035
The two men you were speaking to.

06:07.952 --> 06:09.578
-Valdez brothers.
-They your friends?

06:09.662 --> 06:12.248
Slim pickings in here, but, yeah.

06:13.291 --> 06:14.875
Yeah, they don't talk much.

06:14.959 --> 06:18.879
Let's just say what they did
to get in here was ghastly.

06:20.381 --> 06:21.632
Do they have family?

06:22.675 --> 06:26.220
A mother.
She'll be alone for a while.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.311
I wish I had better news, Mr. Fisk,
but the appeal--

06:33.394 --> 06:36.147
-I didn't ask you here for that.
-Oh.

06:37.273 --> 06:39.525
I need you to write down the following.

06:41.527 --> 06:44.238
The office of Caplan and Dayhill...

06:44.322 --> 06:47.200
they have a client,
his name is Stewart Finney.

06:47.283 --> 06:50.453
-He needs his legal retainer bolstered.
-What?

06:50.536 --> 06:51.912
Andrea Valdez.

06:52.830 --> 06:55.833
She's 62.
She lives in Spanish Harlem.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.586
Needs her rent paid indefinitely.

06:58.669 --> 07:03.216
-What is this?
-Untraceable, if you handle it correctly.

07:03.299 --> 07:05.801
Mr. Fisk, I warned you
about getting involved in the--

07:05.884 --> 07:07.303
Get it done!

07:27.156 --> 07:30.534
-Fisk.
-Anything on Dutton?

07:30.618 --> 07:32.578
He and his men haven't emerged
from block A today.

07:32.661 --> 07:34.913
No way to get in.
That wing's impenetrable.

07:35.999 --> 07:37.583
For now.

07:37.666 --> 07:40.962
The paper's interesting, though.
Check out the front page.

07:45.716 --> 07:46.925
The Punisher.

07:47.010 --> 07:48.761
Apparently, he gunned down
the Irish in a big way.

07:48.844 --> 07:51.639
Mmm, Nesbitt was a problematic leader.

07:51.722 --> 07:53.182
He took out the Dogs of Hell, too.

07:53.266 --> 07:55.726
Blew up their clubhouse.
They charged him with 37 counts of murder.

07:56.685 --> 07:59.480
Wow, perhaps his name suits him.

07:59.563 --> 08:03.401
I'd say. Rumor is some of the Cartel
got meat hooks through their faces.

08:05.611 --> 08:08.822
- The Cartel?
- The Mexicans.

08:10.949 --> 08:12.451
If I'm correct...

08:13.577 --> 08:16.414
Dutton didn't do business with the Cartel.

08:23.254 --> 08:26.674
On the 22nd,
Dutton's lieutenant mentioned...

08:27.758 --> 08:31.387
a deal with the Aryans
to move product in the Dogs' territory.

08:31.470 --> 08:32.721
A hostile takeover.

08:35.308 --> 08:37.893
Does Dutton have connections
with the Irish?

08:39.437 --> 08:41.730
Some heroin deal gone south.
That was a while back, though.

08:44.483 --> 08:46.652
I know what I'm asking for
will be difficult.

08:46.735 --> 08:50.073
I'm not worried about difficult.
I'm not even worried about illegal.

08:50.989 --> 08:52.533
Your funds have almost been depleted.

08:52.616 --> 08:55.161
Building up your little protection crew
wasn't cheap.

08:55.244 --> 08:56.995
Nor should it be.

08:57.080 --> 09:00.666
Your cash is almost gone.
If I do this, that's it.

09:00.749 --> 09:04.420
After that, anything you need
for the rest of your stay,

09:04.503 --> 09:07.840
you'll be dipping into the reserves,
into Vanessa's protection.

09:08.757 --> 09:10.426
I won't need anything after this.

09:15.848 --> 09:18.642
This guard you've spoken to,

09:19.560 --> 09:22.730
do I want to know
what you'll be asking him to do?

09:52.093 --> 09:54.178
I see you got my message.

11:03.164 --> 11:05.123
Shh, I've got you, Matthew.

11:42.411 --> 11:44.788
Who's... who's there?

12:02.515 --> 12:03.682
Elektra?

12:09.813 --> 12:10.939
Oh, slowly.

12:13.651 --> 12:15.068
You okay?

12:18.238 --> 12:19.657
Where is he?

12:20.824 --> 12:23.911
-Stick? He left. Remember?
-No, not Stick.

12:23.994 --> 12:25.371
The boy.

12:27.373 --> 12:28.749
The one you killed.

12:29.708 --> 12:33.211
-It's been taken care of.
-Not "it."

12:33.837 --> 12:35.464
He.

12:36.424 --> 12:38.592
- Well, he tried to kill you.

12:39.510 --> 12:42.220
He was scared.
He was just a kid.

12:43.681 --> 12:47.726
If you'd spared him, he would've sent
his big brothers after us.

12:47.810 --> 12:50.103
- I killed him in self-defense.

12:50.187 --> 12:52.523
Even your precious court of law
would say that's legitimate--

12:52.606 --> 12:53.857
It doesn't work that way.

12:54.775 --> 12:57.986
Well...  it's a good thing
I'm not on trial.

13:00.323 --> 13:03.784
- We need to tell the police.
- Tell them what?

13:03.867 --> 13:07.538
I killed a member
of an ancient organization of ninjas

13:07.621 --> 13:11.249
that are digging a giant hole
in midtown Manhattan?

13:11.334 --> 13:14.169
Perhaps we should.
Maybe they need a laugh.

13:15.671 --> 13:18.507
But you and I, we've seen it.

13:19.758 --> 13:21.594
The Hand is very real.

13:22.720 --> 13:26.890
And they know we're onto them.
The battle has begun, Matthew.

13:26.974 --> 13:29.435
There's nothing we can do
about it now but fight.

13:29.518 --> 13:31.061
Look...

13:32.229 --> 13:35.733
I wish I could tell you that
I'm not going to pull my sword...

13:35.816 --> 13:38.736
-but I will if I have to.
-You said you wanted to be good.

13:41.489 --> 13:43.741
- I do.
- But you don't.

13:43.824 --> 13:46.869
I saw it ten years ago
with Roscoe Sweeney...

13:47.953 --> 13:49.788
and I saw it again last night.

13:50.706 --> 13:53.125
- Your adrenaline spiked, Elektra.

13:53.208 --> 13:55.335
You enjoy killing.

13:58.881 --> 14:03.969
And you may say you wanna be good for me,
but that's not who you really are, is it?

14:12.520 --> 14:14.772
The first time I took a life...

14:15.981 --> 14:17.816
I was 12 years old.

14:21.319 --> 14:23.447
I did it of my own volition.

14:24.907 --> 14:27.242
I wasn't saving another.

14:27.325 --> 14:29.703
I wasn't even protecting myself.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.667
I did it...

14:34.750 --> 14:36.669
because I needed to know that I could.

14:38.671 --> 14:41.339
Not that I could get away with it.

14:42.257 --> 14:45.886
Not that I could get used to it.

14:48.138 --> 14:50.265
And you enjoyed it.

14:56.730 --> 15:00.317
You know, Stick taught us
to never let anyone get close.

15:05.656 --> 15:08.826
-I fell in love with you.
-I loved you, too.

15:11.161 --> 15:12.329
That wasn't a lie.

15:12.413 --> 15:15.958
I fell in love with you, so I don't want
to keep judging you for who you are.

15:17.250 --> 15:20.838
And this...
this is who I am.

15:22.798 --> 15:25.468
We have to stop corrupting each other.

15:33.934 --> 15:36.186
We can't do this anymore.

15:40.190 --> 15:41.817
Say something.

15:44.152 --> 15:46.363
The Hand will decimate your city.

15:51.201 --> 15:52.828
Not if I stop them.

15:52.911 --> 15:56.540
-You'll die.
-Yeah, maybe.

15:57.332 --> 15:59.376
But this is a war I need to fight alone.

16:04.507 --> 16:06.675
Goodbye, Elektra.

16:25.068 --> 16:30.073
The circumstances are unfortunate,
but each loss brings opportunity.

16:30.157 --> 16:33.661
- I'm glad we have this chance to meet.
- Hmm.

16:35.412 --> 16:37.205
You have something you wanna say to me?

16:39.332 --> 16:41.043
I've been following your case...

16:43.546 --> 16:45.964
as much as one could in this cage.

16:49.718 --> 16:53.346
I want you to know...
what happened to your family that day--

16:53.430 --> 16:54.515
Don't you do that.

16:54.598 --> 16:56.809
You don't talk about my family.
You got that?

16:56.892 --> 16:58.393
Just don't do it.

16:59.394 --> 17:02.439
-I consider it a tragedy.
-That right?

17:03.398 --> 17:05.984
You can save your bullshit sympathy,
'cause I don't buy it.

17:06.068 --> 17:08.028
I understand why you'd think that.

17:09.905 --> 17:12.282
Look, you got something
to say to me or not?

17:12.365 --> 17:17.245
Yes. I've crossed paths
with your attorneys... before.

17:18.330 --> 17:21.499
Needless to say, I'm not a...
a huge fan.

17:22.626 --> 17:25.671
Pushing you towards a sentence
in a mental health facility,

17:25.754 --> 17:28.799
after everything you've been through,
that would have been a travesty.

17:28.882 --> 17:32.427
-As opposed to what?
-Closure.

17:34.680 --> 17:36.348
Since I've been incarcerated,

17:36.431 --> 17:40.894
I've developed an empathy towards those
who suffer by the hand of the law.

17:40.978 --> 17:43.480
I think I've heard enough
of your bullshit, okay?

17:44.397 --> 17:46.775
You said closure.
What'd you mean?

17:49.903 --> 17:54.032
There's a man, here, in the big box.

17:59.537 --> 18:00.706
He's a prisoner.

18:02.124 --> 18:03.959
He's been overheard...

18:04.042 --> 18:08.380
boasting about his involvement
with several criminal factions.

18:10.382 --> 18:15.512
This man... he most definitely had a hand
in the massacre in the park.

18:17.640 --> 18:19.141
I want a name.

18:20.058 --> 18:23.061
-He's in another cell block...
-I didn't ask you that.

18:23.145 --> 18:25.606
...which he essentially owns,

18:25.689 --> 18:28.525
heavily guarded by guards
and inmates alike.

18:28.609 --> 18:31.528
-I don't give a shit. I want a name.
-Dutton.

18:34.156 --> 18:37.242
He's not Irish.
He's not Cartel.

18:37.325 --> 18:38.952
He's not a biker.

18:41.204 --> 18:43.206
He's something else entirely.

18:44.541 --> 18:47.502
I believe that he facilitated the deal...

18:48.586 --> 18:51.298
between the three groups
that you've been targeting.

18:51.381 --> 18:52.590
What's in it for you?

18:53.884 --> 18:55.844
He controls much of this prison...

18:56.845 --> 19:00.849
which has... made my life here...

19:02.851 --> 19:04.477
difficult.

19:04.561 --> 19:06.897
So why haven't you done it yourself?

19:06.980 --> 19:09.692
'Cause, Mr. Castle,
unlike most of the population here,

19:09.775 --> 19:11.568
my plan is to keep my head down,

19:11.652 --> 19:14.947
so I can get out...
in the foreseeable future.

19:22.245 --> 19:23.956
-They with you?
-Yeah, something like that.

19:24.039 --> 19:25.082
That right?

19:33.716 --> 19:38.261
Well, I don't help shitbag,
has-been mob bosses.

19:38.345 --> 19:40.263
-"Has-been"?
-You heard what I said.

19:52.275 --> 19:55.653
-I'm simply proposing an arrangement.
-I don't do arrangements.

19:56.363 --> 19:58.656
You should rethink that...

19:58.741 --> 20:01.409
considering the amount of enemies
you have in here.

20:01.493 --> 20:03.370
I'm not gonna be your goddamn trigger man.

20:03.453 --> 20:05.873
-I'm not doing it.
-I'm offering you the opportunity

20:05.956 --> 20:10.585
to confront the man implicated
in the deaths of your family.

20:10.668 --> 20:13.463
Yes, I benefit from your actions.

20:15.716 --> 20:18.719
But the tide raises all ships, Mr. Castle.

20:20.512 --> 20:25.642
If, for some reason, my involvement
diminishes your passion for answers...

20:25.726 --> 20:27.227
for revenge...

20:28.561 --> 20:30.563
well, that's your choice.

20:31.774 --> 20:35.027
But the war you waged on New York City...

20:35.944 --> 20:37.821
it got you nowhere.

20:40.198 --> 20:45.620
I'm offering you something...
no one else could.

20:48.373 --> 20:51.418
If you don't want my help, fine.

20:53.461 --> 20:54.671
By all means...

20:55.756 --> 20:56.840
enjoy prison.

21:00.552 --> 21:01.762
How would it work?

21:08.601 --> 21:11.104
My resources here are limited,

21:11.188 --> 21:15.025
but I can assure you
safe passage to cell block A...

21:16.318 --> 21:19.071
which is run by Dutton and his men.

21:20.989 --> 21:23.658
Guards have a shift change at 1500 hours.

21:23.741 --> 21:26.286
Dutton's men will be in their cells.
We can get you to him.

21:26.369 --> 21:27.996
We have one guard on our side,
but you'll only have

21:28.080 --> 21:31.541
a seven-minute window to reach Dutton,
get your answers and get out.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.168
I assume that
gives you enough time.

21:33.251 --> 21:35.462
-When?
-Does that mean you'll do it?

21:35.545 --> 21:37.422
-When?
-Today.

21:42.552 --> 21:44.179
After this, you and me, we're done.

21:44.262 --> 21:46.014
Yes, we're done.

21:53.814 --> 21:55.858
The shiv is the best I can offer.

21:56.691 --> 21:59.194
Something tells me you'll make do.

22:07.369 --> 22:08.745
Hey.

22:09.955 --> 22:13.541
- You're hurt?
- What makes you say that?

22:14.835 --> 22:17.254
-Can I come in?
-Yeah.

22:19.422 --> 22:20.798
We need to talk.

22:20.883 --> 22:24.011
It's not a great time, Foggy.

22:24.094 --> 22:28.015
Never is. Not lately.
And that's the point, so I'll be brief.

22:28.098 --> 22:30.600
I think we should shutter the office
for a few weeks.

22:30.683 --> 22:33.436
It may be drastic,
but after everything that just happened,

22:33.520 --> 22:35.605
we need to think about our priorities.

22:35.688 --> 22:38.191
To decide how to proceed
with Nelson and Murdock.

22:39.651 --> 22:44.114
Are you talking about our firm...
or you talking about our friendship?

22:44.197 --> 22:46.824
For a while, they went hand-in-hand.

22:49.995 --> 22:51.163
I think you're right.

22:51.955 --> 22:54.541
I think putting some distance
between us is smart.

22:57.002 --> 22:59.212
What?
Isn't that what you wanted?

23:00.923 --> 23:05.177
What I wanted...
was time for us to rethink things--

23:05.260 --> 23:07.220
Time isn't gonna change who I am,
or what I do.

23:07.304 --> 23:08.931
-I don't want to talk about that--
-Yes, you do.

23:09.014 --> 23:11.183
-That's why you came.
-I came to talk to my friend,

23:11.266 --> 23:12.935
not the vigilante.

23:13.018 --> 23:14.978
They're the same person, Foggy.

23:17.522 --> 23:18.898
They weren't always.

23:21.859 --> 23:24.404
Either way... I have to do this.

23:25.738 --> 23:28.533
As we speak, there are horrible things
happening in this city.

23:28.616 --> 23:29.952
Of course.

23:30.035 --> 23:31.911
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you, so...

23:31.995 --> 23:35.707
You don't get to create danger,
and then protect us from that danger.

23:36.624 --> 23:38.418
That's not heroic.

23:38.501 --> 23:39.962
That's insane.

23:40.045 --> 23:41.296
We were really close

23:41.379 --> 23:44.799
to winning the Frank Castle case
and getting that guy the help he needed.

23:44.882 --> 23:47.260
I don't know what tanked it,
but I know we had a shot,

23:47.344 --> 23:51.014
mostly because I worked my ass off
to cover for you.

23:51.098 --> 23:54.559
-I deserve better than that.
-I know.

23:56.186 --> 23:58.605
Every time I walk up those stairs...

23:58.688 --> 24:01.066
I wonder if today is the day
you're dead in your living room.

24:01.149 --> 24:03.151
I'm not gonna stop, Foggy.

24:03.235 --> 24:04.861
Not anytime soon.

24:06.113 --> 24:09.282
And to be honest, I'm done
apologizing to you for who I am.

24:10.283 --> 24:14.537
If I'm holding you back, then you should
consider closing the office for good.

24:14.621 --> 24:18.291
You can start over without the stuff
that gets in your way.

24:19.834 --> 24:21.461
Without me.

24:22.837 --> 24:26.424
-That's not what I came to say.
-But it's what I'm saying.

24:28.176 --> 24:30.303
What am I supposed to tell Karen?

24:32.847 --> 24:36.309
I don't know.
Same thing I'm telling you.

24:37.477 --> 24:39.479
You're better off without me.

24:45.527 --> 24:47.237
See you around, Matt.

24:48.863 --> 24:50.532
Take care of yourself.

25:02.169 --> 25:05.547
I'm so sorry I'm late.
I... I never set an alarm.

25:05.630 --> 25:07.215
I never need to, but, uh...

25:07.299 --> 25:11.678
let's be honest, it's been, uh...
quite the week.

25:15.765 --> 25:17.184
What's going on?

25:18.726 --> 25:21.438
-Packing up.
-The Castle files?

25:21.521 --> 25:23.273
Are you hungry?
Let's get some food.

25:23.356 --> 25:25.733
Thanks to Frank Castle, anyone that was
gonna walk through those doors

25:25.817 --> 25:26.859
is now gonna go elsewhere.

25:26.943 --> 25:28.778
Actually, can I show you something?

25:33.533 --> 25:37.329
We should take a long lunch.
We need to talk.

25:37.412 --> 25:41.374
Yeah, yeah, we should.
Um... do you remember John Doe?

25:41.458 --> 25:43.210
The report the...
the medical examiner falsified?

25:43.293 --> 25:45.044
Nope. Totally blocked it.

25:45.128 --> 25:48.715
Um... well, I think I...
I found something pretty big here.

25:48.798 --> 25:51.509
-Whose house did you break into this time?
-No need.

25:51.593 --> 25:54.679
It's just press passes
and NYPD files and, um...

25:55.680 --> 25:58.975
So these pictures are all from the day
Frank's family was killed.

25:59.058 --> 26:01.519
I've seen enough bloody bodies
to last me a lifetime.

26:01.603 --> 26:03.855
- Can we please just--
- Just a sec.

26:05.523 --> 26:07.692
Okay, um... look.

26:08.776 --> 26:12.864
- All right, you see him?
- Sure do.

26:13.948 --> 26:16.033
Now look.

26:17.119 --> 26:18.870
Maybe he was bagged and tagged already?

26:18.953 --> 26:21.080
Right, well, that's what I thought, but...
I checked

26:21.164 --> 26:22.790
and I couldn't find any death certificate.

26:22.874 --> 26:25.001
Whoever he was,
it's like he was never there.

26:25.084 --> 26:27.545
--Foggy, look. He was.

26:27.629 --> 26:30.673
He was there.
What if he is our John Doe?

26:30.757 --> 26:33.050
Karen... let it go.

26:33.135 --> 26:35.262
The trial is over.

26:37.555 --> 26:40.225
--Wait.

26:40.308 --> 26:42.685
No, no, nothing has changed.

26:42.769 --> 26:44.103
There is still a conspiracy.
I mean, this...

26:44.187 --> 26:46.481
this guy could be the key
to exposing the cover-up.

26:46.564 --> 26:49.651
Maybe. Somebody else's problem now.

26:49.734 --> 26:52.111
What... But just like that?
I don't--

26:52.195 --> 26:55.490
We're lawyers.
I got bigger things to worry about.

26:55.573 --> 26:58.326
Like what? Like... like getting
Nelson and Murdock back on top?

26:58.410 --> 27:02.205
-This would do that.
-There is no Nelson and Murdock.

27:03.122 --> 27:04.541
Look around.

27:06.209 --> 27:09.212
Okay. You and Matt,
you fought at the courthouse.

27:09.296 --> 27:11.714
You weren't your best selves,
but none of us have been for a long time--

27:11.798 --> 27:13.758
I was my best self that day...

27:13.841 --> 27:16.386
at the courthouse, covering for him.
And so were you.

27:17.387 --> 27:19.347
You're eerily good at this stuff.

27:19.431 --> 27:20.723
- But Matt has--

27:20.807 --> 27:22.350
He's...

27:23.518 --> 27:25.228
He's got other things to take care of.

27:31.150 --> 27:33.986
All right, when I went over
to his apartment the other day...

27:35.112 --> 27:37.657
to get him to come to the trial,
there...

27:39.451 --> 27:42.870
there was a... a woman there,
in his bed.

27:44.831 --> 27:47.792
Okay, no. You know, whatever...

27:47.875 --> 27:50.712
Whatever is going on with Matt, he's...

27:50.795 --> 27:53.381
he's either not capable or...
or not willing

27:53.465 --> 27:57.219
to make room for anything else
in his life... right now.

27:58.470 --> 28:00.513
I should've warned you.

28:03.308 --> 28:06.436
No. No, you shouldn't have.

28:06.519 --> 28:08.605
Look...

28:08.688 --> 28:12.650
if Matt doesn't wanna share his life
with me, that is between me and him.

28:12.734 --> 28:15.778
The same way that your friendship
with Matt is between you and him.

28:15.862 --> 28:18.781
I don't need to be warned,
Foggy, I just...

28:18.865 --> 28:20.992
I cannot be lied to anymore.

28:21.909 --> 28:24.246
All I want is the truth about something.

28:25.997 --> 28:27.457
I get it.

28:28.958 --> 28:32.003
I'll give you a call
if something changes...

28:33.004 --> 28:35.673
but for now I suggest that...

28:36.591 --> 28:40.262
both of us start thinking
about a life outside this office.

29:21.969 --> 29:23.220
Oh, God.

29:23.305 --> 29:26.098
Come on. Shit, shit, shit.
Come on, come on.

29:26.182 --> 29:28.100
- You don't want to do that, Stan.

29:28.184 --> 29:30.186
Don't...  don't move.

29:31.438 --> 29:32.855
You're an accountant.

29:33.690 --> 29:35.358
A greedy one, yes...

29:35.442 --> 29:39.153
but something tells me, even if you
take that shot, you're gonna miss.

29:39.236 --> 29:42.365
And trust me...
you don't wanna miss.

29:42.449 --> 29:43.950
I'm not like them.

29:45.743 --> 29:48.330
-Who?
-I don't do what they do.

29:49.456 --> 29:52.124
-Are you talking about the Hand?
-Yes.

29:52.208 --> 29:55.002
--Put the gun down.

29:55.086 --> 29:56.546
How do I know
you're not working with them--

29:58.965 --> 30:01.258
I didn't say anything.
Please, I didn't say anything.

30:01.343 --> 30:04.512
That's the problem, Stan.
What do you know about the Hand?

30:04.596 --> 30:07.056
I don't. Please, I'd rather die.

30:07.139 --> 30:08.933
Well, that's not gonna help anyone.

30:09.016 --> 30:12.061
They destroy everything
that gets in their way.

30:13.313 --> 30:14.647
The Roxxon Corporation...

30:16.316 --> 30:20.277
the secret room...
the ledger, the dirt, the hole.

30:20.362 --> 30:23.823
I know about it all, Stan.
I need to know what they're planning.

30:23.906 --> 30:26.326
Planning? It's already been done.

30:26.409 --> 30:28.244
-What's been done?
-Nothing!

30:29.161 --> 30:30.204
I'll protect you.

30:32.039 --> 30:33.833
They have my son.

30:33.916 --> 30:36.293
They took Daniel!

30:37.169 --> 30:39.296
I don't know what they're doing to him.

30:40.340 --> 30:46.012
These bodyguards weren't protecting me.
They were holding me hostage.

30:46.095 --> 30:51.559
If I tell you anything...
they will kill my son.

30:59.359 --> 31:02.904
-Where are they holding him?
-Some kind of drug operation.

31:02.987 --> 31:06.824
I don't know what they're doing there.
They call it the Farm.

31:07.409 --> 31:10.077
-Take me there.
-I've thought about it...

31:10.161 --> 31:11.454
but it's a fortress.

31:12.497 --> 31:16.083
-It's impossible to get inside.
-Take me there.

31:27.679 --> 31:29.221
Karen Page.

31:30.473 --> 31:32.600
Well, you guys had
a hell of a day in court.

31:32.684 --> 31:35.102
Front row seats
to the trial of the decade.

31:35.186 --> 31:36.729
- Did you bring me a T-shirt?

31:37.647 --> 31:39.065
No. Uh...

31:40.316 --> 31:42.359
I might have something better.

31:42.444 --> 31:43.861
These are from the NYPD files

31:43.945 --> 31:46.072
-from Castle's family's autopsy report.
-Mmm-hmm.

31:46.155 --> 31:49.659
-Um... so, here... you can see here--
-The... the body and here...

31:49.742 --> 31:51.953
the body's gone.
Is this some sort of test?

31:52.036 --> 31:53.830
Well, I...
I think this is the John Doe

31:53.913 --> 31:55.915
the medical examiner said he covered up.

31:55.998 --> 31:59.461
-Said when?
-During the Frank Castle trial.

31:59.544 --> 32:01.879
Tepper's testimony wasn't public.

32:02.505 --> 32:05.467
Oh, my God. Sorry, they...
they cleared the courtroom.

32:05.550 --> 32:07.218
I was one of a handful
of people who heard it.

32:07.301 --> 32:10.179
--Okay, so we... we identify John Doe,

32:10.262 --> 32:12.932
and then we find out why
he was important enough to hide.

32:13.015 --> 32:15.602
Uh... you know what?
Actually, I think that, um...

32:16.519 --> 32:17.854
I think you should do this.

32:18.688 --> 32:20.648
-Trial's over.
-So?

32:20.732 --> 32:23.275
So, Frank is in prison,

32:23.359 --> 32:26.237
and everyone's retreated to their corners,
including my bosses,

32:26.320 --> 32:29.073
one of whom has repeatedly told me
to let it go and move on.

32:29.156 --> 32:31.784
And do you... do you wanna move on?

32:32.494 --> 32:34.328
Case is closed.

32:34.411 --> 32:36.413
Castle tanked his own case.
He got put away.

32:36.498 --> 32:37.957
I just think you should
carry the torch on this.

32:38.040 --> 32:40.460
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

32:40.543 --> 32:43.630
Okay, so...
I just wanna rewind this informal meeting

32:43.713 --> 32:45.465
-we're having by about 30 seconds.
-What?

32:45.548 --> 32:48.968
You come to me with a lead, with a...
a really good lead, right?

32:49.051 --> 32:50.887
And now you just wanna take off?
Right?

32:50.970 --> 32:53.305
I mean, it's... it's sort of like
a pitcher going to the 8th inning

32:53.389 --> 32:54.932
with a no-hit shutout,
and just walking away.

32:55.016 --> 32:57.894
Look, this was supposed to be about
saving my law firm, and I didn't--

32:57.977 --> 33:00.312
I get that. At first, yeah.

33:00.396 --> 33:03.065
But I have to tell you, in the last week,
I've gotten about ten phone calls

33:03.149 --> 33:05.359
from people wanting to know
where I'm getting my information.

33:06.861 --> 33:08.488
-Really?
-Mmm-hmm.

33:09.614 --> 33:11.157
What'd you tell 'em?

33:11.240 --> 33:12.617
What do you think I told 'em?
I took all the credit.

33:12.700 --> 33:13.868
- But the point is...

33:13.951 --> 33:15.411
...that when my phone
starts ringing like that,

33:15.495 --> 33:17.288
that means that you're shaking
the right trees.

33:17.371 --> 33:20.041
So, yeah, uh, sure.
I mean, the... the case is closed.

33:20.124 --> 33:23.252
Frank Castle's in prison.
But this thing ain't over.

33:23.335 --> 33:25.379
Not yet. Not by a long shot.

33:25.462 --> 33:28.049
You know it. 'Cause you know
you're on to something.

33:31.719 --> 33:34.972
-Yeah, okay, okay.
-Okay. All right, so, um...

33:35.056 --> 33:36.891
I pull some strings, we, um...

33:36.974 --> 33:40.102
find out the last known address
of medical examiner Tepper,

33:40.186 --> 33:43.147
and maybe he'll be more willing to have
a conversation outside of the courtroom,

33:43.230 --> 33:45.107
away from the icy death gaze
of Frank Castle.

33:45.191 --> 33:46.358
No, but wait.
Talk to who?

33:46.442 --> 33:47.443
-Whom.
-Wait, talk to me?

33:47.527 --> 33:49.236
-I--
-No, no, no. To us.

33:49.320 --> 33:50.863
Karen, to us.

33:50.947 --> 33:52.907
And don't get cocky.
You're not that good yet.

33:52.990 --> 33:54.283
Got a long time to go.

34:09.549 --> 34:12.509
Cell 305. Room with a view.

34:13.260 --> 34:15.638
Seven minutes, and that's it.

34:48.921 --> 34:52.216
...makes the grab,
so a wasted single by Young

34:52.299 --> 34:53.425
somehow sends it into...

34:53.509 --> 34:54.677
Twelve.

34:54.761 --> 34:58.848
Prick's 200 light.
Rat-faced son of a bitch.

35:07.189 --> 35:09.609
You and me, we gotta talk.

35:14.446 --> 35:17.116
This is it. The Farm.

35:18.660 --> 35:20.953
-Stay here.
-I'm coming with you.

35:21.037 --> 35:22.872
He's my son.

35:22.955 --> 35:26.125
You wanna be alive to see him?
Stay here.

35:28.169 --> 35:31.297
Doctor? Doctor, my name's Karen Page, I...

35:34.050 --> 35:38.512
Sir, I know your testimony in the case
against Frank Castle hurt your career.

35:40.640 --> 35:42.349
I think I can help you.

35:43.267 --> 35:45.519
But I also think there are
other people involved

35:45.602 --> 35:47.521
who could really use your help.

35:54.028 --> 35:55.780
I remember you.

35:56.948 --> 35:58.282
You were with the defense.

35:58.950 --> 36:02.119
-I'm not with them now.
-We're with the New York Bulletin.

36:02.995 --> 36:04.371
Please.

36:10.336 --> 36:12.504
After what happened
at the courthouse,

36:12.588 --> 36:15.925
the mayor asked me to step down.

36:16.718 --> 36:19.011
I know I sound paranoid, but...

36:19.804 --> 36:21.973
there have been people following me.

36:22.056 --> 36:24.641
You're a target because of what you know.

36:24.726 --> 36:28.020
'Cause whatever that is,
they... they want to keep in the dark.

36:28.104 --> 36:32.233
Karen has found something
that will bring the truth to light.

36:32.316 --> 36:33.609
Here, uh...

36:34.526 --> 36:36.946
This... is this the body
they asked you to make disappear?

36:37.029 --> 36:39.824
-I shouldn't be talking to you.
-I understand you're afraid.

36:39.907 --> 36:42.034
You can either continue to be trapped
by what you've done

36:42.118 --> 36:43.995
or you can tell us what you know

36:44.078 --> 36:45.955
so that we can go out
and expose the real bad guys.

36:46.038 --> 36:48.082
And then you can get back to living
your life, because...

36:48.165 --> 36:51.252
this place is not where your story ends.

36:57.466 --> 36:58.885
That's him.

36:58.968 --> 37:01.888
-That's the John Doe.
-Okay, um...

37:01.971 --> 37:03.890
Uh, did he have a wallet?

37:03.973 --> 37:05.850
Uh, what about any...
any identifying marks?

37:05.933 --> 37:09.395
- Scars? Tattoos? Any--
- I tell you this...

37:12.189 --> 37:14.817
you have to substantiate it
before you print a word of it.

37:14.901 --> 37:16.235
Of course.

37:18.070 --> 37:20.322
All right, he didn't have a name,

37:20.406 --> 37:23.200
but tucked inside his left shoe,
he did have something.

37:23.284 --> 37:25.912
- What?
- A police call sign.

37:26.788 --> 37:28.705
A special code.

37:28.790 --> 37:30.750
Look, John Doe wasn't a criminal,

37:30.833 --> 37:34.628
and he wasn't some innocent bystander
in the park, either.

37:34.711 --> 37:36.505
He was an undercover cop.

37:38.715 --> 37:40.927
--Jesus.

37:41.010 --> 37:44.931
Now, you make any noise, anything at all,
I'm gonna open you up like a bag.

37:45.014 --> 37:47.391
I'll watch you bleed out
all over this floor.

37:47.474 --> 37:49.894
Now, you nod if you understand me.

37:51.020 --> 37:52.604
Okay.

37:52.688 --> 37:54.565
--Shh.

37:55.482 --> 37:56.692
Stanton massacre.

37:56.776 --> 38:00.196
The carousel hit.
I hear you were there.

38:00.279 --> 38:01.738
What if I was?

38:03.157 --> 38:06.077
You're a goddamn lunatic.

38:06.160 --> 38:07.829
What the hell were you doing there?

38:10.414 --> 38:11.916
Drug deal.

38:11.999 --> 38:14.168
I was brokering between
three groups of assholes

38:14.251 --> 38:15.627
who barely spoke the same language.

38:15.711 --> 38:17.713
-What happened?
-What do you think happened?

38:17.797 --> 38:19.631
-Tell me who started the shooting.
-What?

38:19.715 --> 38:22.593
You tell me who pulled the trigger.
Who made the order?

38:22.676 --> 38:24.470
-It went south.
-What do you mean, "It went south"?

38:24.553 --> 38:26.263
-It happens.
-What does that mean, "It went south"?

38:26.347 --> 38:27.348
What do you mean?

38:27.431 --> 38:30.517
It means we're not as dumb
as they thought we were.

38:30.601 --> 38:33.770
-We realized what it was.
-What was it?

38:33.855 --> 38:37.108
It wasn't a massacre, asshole.
It was a sting.

38:37.191 --> 38:41.112
-A what?
-My source warned me.

38:41.195 --> 38:43.655
The feds infiltrated one of the gangs.
I'm not sure which.

38:43.739 --> 38:47.784
They found out how big the deal was.
Massive exchange.

38:47.869 --> 38:51.288
A real game changer.
But they weren't after any of us.

38:51.372 --> 38:52.748
They were after the man in charge,

38:52.832 --> 38:54.791
the man who organized
the whole damn thing.

38:54.876 --> 38:56.460
Who's that?
Who is that? I want a name.

38:56.543 --> 38:57.628
I never met him.

38:58.170 --> 39:00.256
He never showed his face.

39:00.339 --> 39:02.842
All I know is he had a line
on pure heroin.

39:03.509 --> 39:05.511
Shit shipped from the Middle East.

39:06.012 --> 39:08.014
They called him the Blacksmith.

39:09.056 --> 39:12.101
The whole thing should've went
by the numbers, but he got wise.

39:12.184 --> 39:13.769
He stayed away.

39:13.853 --> 39:15.980
And when they realized
he wasn't gonna show,

39:16.063 --> 39:18.315
someone started shooting.
That's all I know.

39:18.815 --> 39:21.568
I swear... to God.

39:26.157 --> 39:28.284
I heard about you.

39:28.367 --> 39:30.702
News travels fast around here.

39:31.703 --> 39:34.706
But there were almost
100 bangers that day,

39:34.790 --> 39:36.667
and every finger found a trigger.

39:37.459 --> 39:40.296
You know, this crusade of yours...

39:41.213 --> 39:42.965
it's never gonna end, right?

39:43.840 --> 39:45.092
Right?

39:49.513 --> 39:52.766
Yeah... yeah, you're right.

39:54.101 --> 39:55.727
- You're right.

40:23.005 --> 40:24.006
Open the door.

40:25.216 --> 40:26.467
Open the door.

40:32.974 --> 40:34.266
What are you doing?

40:35.101 --> 40:36.477
Open the goddamn door.

40:36.560 --> 40:39.563
Hey. Hey.

40:41.065 --> 40:42.191
Mr. Castle...

40:42.274 --> 40:44.151
thank you.

40:44.235 --> 40:45.694
I couldn't have done it without you.

40:45.777 --> 40:47.989
- They got Dutton!
- Holy shit, man!

40:48.072 --> 40:51.283
There he is. There he is.
You're a dead man.

40:51.367 --> 40:53.869
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

40:53.953 --> 40:57.164
--Come on. You're dead!

42:40.142 --> 42:43.645
Inmate! Fall on your knees!

42:58.702 --> 43:00.036
Open up!

43:09.088 --> 43:10.506
Not strong enough.

43:10.589 --> 43:12.299
--Hai.

43:18.930 --> 43:19.931
Mmm.

43:20.015 --> 43:21.767
We found two guards unconscious

43:21.850 --> 43:22.893
in the Roxxon garage.

43:22.976 --> 43:24.520
What were they protecting?

43:24.603 --> 43:26.230
Stan Gibson, sir.

43:27.148 --> 43:30.651
Find him.
The process is almost complete.

43:43.205 --> 43:45.374
Tell your man to stand down.

43:45.457 --> 43:47.751
Don't shoot.
Lower the gun.

43:48.669 --> 43:50.171
Lower the gun!

44:02.308 --> 44:04.976
There are more men outside.

44:06.603 --> 44:08.063
Not conscious ones.

44:09.105 --> 44:10.691
Tell me about the Farm.

44:12.067 --> 44:14.027
What are you growing here?

44:18.907 --> 44:21.202
I am not afraid to hurt you.

44:21.285 --> 44:22.786
I know you're not.

44:23.287 --> 44:27.708
But you are not the only devil
who will walk these streets.

44:31.920 --> 44:35.882
-What's in the basement?
-The rising is coming.

44:36.383 --> 44:38.719
You are but one man, akuma-san.

44:38.802 --> 44:41.847
You cannot stop what we have started.

44:46.017 --> 44:47.644
What is that?

44:53.359 --> 44:55.110
That's blood.

44:55.193 --> 44:58.697
It wasn't just a random gang shootout.
It was a sting.

44:58.780 --> 45:01.867
- Who knows who's involved?
- Cops, DA's office, obviously.

45:01.950 --> 45:05.871
-The mayor? How high does this go?
-I don't know.

45:05.954 --> 45:07.373
But I can tell by that look in your eye

45:07.456 --> 45:10.083
that you're not gonna get any rest
till you figure it out.

45:10.166 --> 45:13.086
So if you wanna camp out in here...

45:14.463 --> 45:15.922
it's all yours.

45:17.841 --> 45:19.301
Start digging.

45:22.346 --> 45:25.015
-Are you serious?
-I'm very serious.

46:00.801 --> 46:03.804
Ben was the best researcher
I've ever known.

46:04.305 --> 46:05.681
I remember.

46:15.649 --> 46:18.193
-Did you--
-Read that? Yes. Yeah, I... I read it.

46:18.276 --> 46:21.237
Look, Ben didn't care,
and I don't, either.

46:27.911 --> 46:30.163
Get to work, okay?

47:21.131 --> 47:22.132
Go.

47:22.215 --> 47:23.550
Are you sure
that's a good idea, Mr. Fisk?

47:23.634 --> 47:24.968
Go now!

47:34.936 --> 47:37.481
How quickly we turn into savages.

47:39.691 --> 47:41.693
As if the moment we walk
through these prison doors--

47:41.777 --> 47:43.779
You tried to have me killed.

47:43.862 --> 47:47.073
Yes, it would've been cleaner that way,
but you got what you wanted!

47:47.157 --> 47:48.784
Given the condition that he was in,

47:48.867 --> 47:54.122
I assume that Dutton admitted
to some involvement in your tragedy.

48:01.547 --> 48:05.216
What do you want?
Why am I still alive?

48:06.468 --> 48:08.637
Because plans change.

48:08.720 --> 48:11.264
Because if you want to survive, you adapt.

48:11.347 --> 48:16.478
Yes! The plan was to kill you.
I needed to close that loop.

48:16.562 --> 48:19.981
I'd already made a deal
with the rest of the guards.

48:20.065 --> 48:22.734
I doubled the cut
that Dutton was paying them.

48:22.818 --> 48:26.488
But that didn't work out, did it?
No, I was wrong.

48:27.489 --> 48:30.408
That's difficult to admit, but...

48:33.203 --> 48:35.872
you have a gift, Mr. Castle.

48:36.873 --> 48:40.043
I assumed that the stories
that I read in the paper

48:40.126 --> 48:45.131
about your attacks on the criminal world
were apocryphal.

48:45.215 --> 48:47.884
How could one man be capable of such...

48:49.595 --> 48:50.637
violence?

48:51.387 --> 48:53.181
But then I saw it...

48:55.266 --> 48:57.268
with my own two eyes.

48:58.812 --> 49:03.900
And when one comes across
someone with such talent...

49:03.984 --> 49:06.444
with such a gift... well...

49:08.739 --> 49:10.448
you don't let that go to waste.

49:11.992 --> 49:13.201
No.

49:14.410 --> 49:15.912
No, you don't.

49:20.458 --> 49:21.710
How's that?

49:50.488 --> 49:51.573
Release him.

49:51.657 --> 49:53.659
-Mr. Fisk, I--
-Do it now!

50:09.299 --> 50:11.843
What the hell is this?

50:12.928 --> 50:15.180
I'm in control now.

50:15.263 --> 50:17.974
-And I've set you free.
-What does that mean, "free"?

50:18.058 --> 50:20.143
I'll show you.

50:22.062 --> 50:23.647
Stay back.

50:23.730 --> 50:27.192
--'Cause everyone warned me

50:27.275 --> 50:30.987
that prison would be
an inhumane environment.

50:32.280 --> 50:36.451
It is.
But I... I find it refreshing.

50:36.534 --> 50:39.537
The perfect microcosm of the animal world.

50:39.621 --> 50:44.751
When an animal wants something,
when it needs something, other things...

50:44.835 --> 50:46.419
need to be stepped on.

50:47.003 --> 50:50.757
You want me on the outside
so I step on every piece of shit I see.

50:50.841 --> 50:54.427
That way, nobody gets strong, and we...
The city's yours for the taking.

50:55.053 --> 50:57.055
Something like that. Yeah.

50:57.138 --> 50:58.807
So if you can do that,
if you can get me out,

50:58.890 --> 51:00.308
why not just do it yourself?

51:00.391 --> 51:03.186
Because I play the long game, Mr. Castle.

51:04.229 --> 51:06.982
You see, when I'm finally
let out of this cage...

51:07.899 --> 51:11.569
it won't be to wage war.
It will be to win one.

51:13.488 --> 51:17.325
You, sir...
you need to focus on now.

51:19.202 --> 51:22.122
I've given you a chance to walk free.

51:22.748 --> 51:25.876
To put that gift of yours to work,
to find...

51:25.959 --> 51:28.003
What does Dutton call him?

51:29.212 --> 51:30.505
The Blacksmith.

51:32.173 --> 51:34.425
If I were in your shoes...

51:34.509 --> 51:37.929
I would use this opportunity
to find your justice,

51:38.013 --> 51:40.891
to kill your way to justice!

51:42.267 --> 51:45.353
And not for me. Of course not.
Not for yourself.

51:48.023 --> 51:49.565
For your family.

51:51.652 --> 51:53.069
For them.

51:57.658 --> 51:58.659
Fisk.

52:00.368 --> 52:01.369
Yes?

52:05.331 --> 52:06.708
You know...

52:08.126 --> 52:09.502
next time I see you...

52:10.545 --> 52:12.588
only one of us walks away.

52:13.674 --> 52:15.383
Yes, of course.

52:16.885 --> 52:18.053
I'm counting on it.

52:47.665 --> 52:50.961
-Is someone there?
-Someone...

53:16.236 --> 53:17.779
These people...

53:22.993 --> 53:24.327
Jesus.

53:36.381 --> 53:38.716
What are they doing to you?

53:45.348 --> 53:48.226
Daniel. Daniel!

53:48.309 --> 53:50.270
Daniel. Oh, Daniel!

53:50.353 --> 53:52.563
We're gonna get them out.
Stan, we're gonna get them all out.

53:52.647 --> 53:53.648
Daniel, my boy.

53:54.983 --> 53:58.444
Oh, my boy. Oh, my boy.

54:01.447 --> 54:02.490
Keys.

54:04.117 --> 54:06.661
Just hold on, my son.

54:19.715 --> 54:21.843
Come here. Thank God.

54:21.927 --> 54:25.513
Thank God.  God.

54:28.308 --> 54:29.392
Get down!

54:33.104 --> 54:35.481
They weren't finished.

54:45.951 --> 54:48.619
The physician says
that your condition is...

54:49.537 --> 54:50.914
is grave.

54:53.124 --> 54:55.543
That your lungs are filling with liquid.

54:57.503 --> 55:02.843
In a few hours, you're likely
to suffocate in your own blood.

55:07.222 --> 55:11.059
But you won't suffer alone.
I'll be here.

55:12.060 --> 55:13.979
Because you were right.

55:16.397 --> 55:20.735
In prison,
there's only room for one kingpin.

56:53.036 --> 56:56.664
You still have scars
to remember me by, I hope.

57:38.373 --> 57:39.415
Wait...

57:41.501 --> 57:43.836
You're dead.

57:45.880 --> 57:48.883
There is no such thing.
