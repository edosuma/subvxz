<i> I'm Alex Mack.</i>

00:04.760 --> 00:06.480
<i> I was just an average kid</i>

00:06.480 --> 00:08.160

changed my life.</i>

<i> My best friend Ray
thinks it's cool.</i>

00:39.360 --> 00:42.680
<i> My sister Annie
thinks I'm a science project.</i>

00:43.680 --> 00:46.080
<i> I can't let anyone else know.</i>

00:46.080 --> 00:48.280
<i> Not even my parents.</i>

00:48.280 --> 00:51.280
<i> I know the Chemical Plant
wants to find me</i>

00:51.280 --> 00:53.720
<i> and turn me into
some experiment.</i>

00:53.720 --> 00:55.360
<i> But you know something?</i>

00:55.360 --> 00:57.920
<i> I guess
I'm not so average anymore.</i>

00:58.920 --> 01:00.880
<i>[Woman]
And so, 1776</i>

01:00.880 --> 01:02.800
<i> marks the success</i>

01:02.800 --> 01:06.760
of the first anti-colonial
movement in modern history.

01:06.760 --> 01:09.520
Thomas Jefferson spoke for all
his countrymen

01:09.520 --> 01:11.960
when he said that the
independent spirit

01:11.960 --> 01:14.480
of the American people
would inspire all.

01:14.480 --> 01:17.840
The United States might never
have come into existence

01:17.840 --> 01:21.440
but the colonists
felt the unjust

01:21.440 --> 01:24.440
and restraining stranglehold
of the British

01:24.440 --> 01:26.320
could no longer be tolerated.

01:26.320 --> 01:29.240
And so, we see the first steps
towards freedom

01:29.240 --> 01:32.440
<i>( voice slows downs ):
And independence were taken</i>

01:32.440 --> 01:36.560
<i>( distorted echoes ): And when
the war of independence started...</i>

01:36.560 --> 01:38.680
<i>( Clock ticking loudly )</i>

01:38.680 --> 01:44.680
<i>( Voice very distorted ): ...The colonists
understood what they were working for...</i>

01:44.680 --> 01:47.320
<i>( Loud clang )</i>

01:47.320 --> 01:49.560
<i>( Creaking )</i>

01:49.560 --> 01:53.080
<i>( Teacher's voice
distorted and echoing )</i>

01:54.080 --> 01:55.160
Yes, Alex?

01:55.160 --> 01:57.120
I'm sorry, Miss Clark

01:57.120 --> 02:00.680
but this class is just
way too boring.

02:00.680 --> 02:04.400
Come on, everyone,
we're out of here.

02:04.400 --> 02:05.360
Everyone:
Yeah!

02:05.360 --> 02:06.800
Excuse me,
excuse me, Alex

02:06.800 --> 02:08.720
but class isn't over yet.

02:13.520 --> 02:14.800
<i>( Bell ringing )</i>

02:14.800 --> 02:15.760
Now it is.

02:15.760 --> 02:17.320
Later, Miss Clark.

02:17.320 --> 02:19.520
Let the revolution begin!

02:19.520 --> 02:21.520
<i>( Cheering and whistling )</i>

02:21.520 --> 02:22.680
Class, please!

02:22.680 --> 02:24.040
Please, please, class.

02:24.040 --> 02:26.240
Oh, please,
class is not over yet.

02:26.240 --> 02:28.040
Please!

02:28.040 --> 02:30.280
<i>( Cheering )</i>

02:30.280 --> 02:34.880
<i>( Whistling and cheering )</i>

02:43.480 --> 02:45.680
Are you still
with us, Miss Mack?

02:45.680 --> 02:49.120
Or have you just completely
left the building?

02:49.120 --> 02:50.120
<i>( All laughing )</i>

02:50.120 --> 02:51.400
Oh.

02:51.400 --> 02:53.320
I assume
you have a question.

02:53.320 --> 02:54.520
Um...

02:56.520 --> 02:58.120
Can I go to the bathroom?

02:58.120 --> 02:59.280
<i>( All laughing )</i>

02:59.280 --> 03:00.440
<i>( Bell ringing )</i>

03:00.440 --> 03:01.560
Dismissed.

03:03.800 --> 03:06.920
Alex, perhaps
you should try concentrating.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.200
Yes, Miss Clark.

03:11.360 --> 03:12.240
<i>( Giggling )</i>

03:12.240 --> 03:13.560
Wait a minute, wait.

03:13.560 --> 03:15.920
She said, "Can I go
to the bathroom?"

03:15.920 --> 03:17.640
I don't know
what happened.

03:17.640 --> 03:19.480
I must have been
daydreaming.

03:19.480 --> 03:22.120
Probably thinking
about yours truly again.

03:22.120 --> 03:23.840
I have that
effect on women.

03:23.840 --> 03:25.880
Please, Louis,
that's not a dream

03:25.880 --> 03:27.040
that's a
nightmare.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.840
I was thinking
about the quest

03:28.840 --> 03:30.440
for independence--
sort of.

03:30.440 --> 03:32.120
You're supposed
to daydream

03:32.120 --> 03:33.880
about things
other than school.

03:33.880 --> 03:34.840
Like what?

03:34.840 --> 03:35.880
Like food.

03:35.880 --> 03:38.280
Chili fries
at the half-life diner.

03:38.280 --> 03:39.720
Well, I just
have to ask

03:39.720 --> 03:41.400
you know,
permission first.

03:41.400 --> 03:43.080
You have to ask
permission

03:43.080 --> 03:44.440
to eat
French fries?

03:44.440 --> 03:46.080
I don't have to, just...

03:46.080 --> 03:47.360
We're not stealing.

03:47.360 --> 03:48.680
Or robbing banks.

03:48.680 --> 03:51.200
You don't ask
to do stuff after school?

03:51.200 --> 03:52.640
To hang out
at the diner?

03:52.640 --> 03:53.600
No way.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.280
So, go ahead
and ask.

03:55.280 --> 03:56.360
What will they say?

03:56.360 --> 03:57.880
No, I'm serious, Alex.

03:57.880 --> 03:59.240
You can't leave now.

03:59.240 --> 04:00.600
That's the way it is.

04:00.600 --> 04:02.000
It's just
French fries.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.360
It isn't like we're
out robbing banks.

04:04.360 --> 04:06.560
Your mother's
making duck tarragon.

04:06.560 --> 04:07.960
She will
want you here.

04:07.960 --> 04:10.200
Aren't you supposed
to set the table

04:10.200 --> 04:11.400
and clean
your room?

04:11.400 --> 04:12.680
Well, is Annie busy?

04:12.680 --> 04:13.760
Annie's not home.

04:13.760 --> 04:14.880
<i>Are you busy, Dad?</i>

04:14.880 --> 04:17.399
I came home
to get some work done

04:17.399 --> 04:20.959
and not to take care
of your responsibilities.

04:20.959 --> 04:22.560
All my friends
are waiting.

04:22.560 --> 04:24.360
Why don't I set the table now

04:24.360 --> 04:26.480
and clean my room
when I get back?

04:26.480 --> 04:27.840
I'll be home by 7:00.

04:27.840 --> 04:28.840
Be home by 5:00.

04:28.840 --> 04:29.800
6:30.

04:29.800 --> 04:30.760
5:30.

04:30.760 --> 04:31.720
6:00.

04:31.720 --> 04:33.560
5:47 P.M.,
not a minute later.

04:33.560 --> 04:34.960
I can live
with that.

04:34.960 --> 04:37.920
Thanks, Dad, pleasure
doing business with you.

04:42.080 --> 04:44.280
I'm not going
to college right away.

04:44.280 --> 04:45.480
I'm going
to travel

04:45.480 --> 04:48.280
although my parents
aren't going to be happy.

04:48.280 --> 04:49.440
I read about
this kid

04:49.440 --> 04:51.640
who makes Annie
look like a slacker.

04:51.640 --> 04:53.280
He's 14,
and he's a lawyer.

04:53.280 --> 04:55.120
Does he have
to get permission

04:55.120 --> 04:56.720
to go for chili fries?

04:56.720 --> 04:57.880
Yeah,
"Please, Mom?

04:57.880 --> 05:00.880
I already finished
with the D.N.A. Evidence."

05:00.880 --> 05:03.200
Let's do this
again tomorrow.

05:03.200 --> 05:04.360
Oh, wait a second.

05:04.360 --> 05:06.360
Tomorrow's Saturday,
no can do.

05:06.360 --> 05:07.800
Oh, yeah,
that's right.

05:07.800 --> 05:08.760
Right, yeah.

05:08.760 --> 05:10.880
What's going on?

05:10.880 --> 05:13.200
Uh, Raymond and I
can't meet up.

05:13.200 --> 05:14.520
We got this, uh...

05:14.520 --> 05:15.760
[Both]
Thing.

05:15.760 --> 05:18.680
You can't hang out
because you have this thing?

05:18.680 --> 05:20.080
That's right.

05:20.080 --> 05:22.760
What exactly is this thing?

05:22.760 --> 05:26.240
If we told, it wouldn't
be a thing anymore, would it?

05:26.240 --> 05:27.880
It would be
a something

05:27.880 --> 05:29.800
and lose what's special
about it.

05:29.800 --> 05:30.840
Exactly.

05:30.840 --> 05:32.840
Sounds like a lame
thing to me.

05:32.840 --> 05:34.800
Oh, man, I got
to go, see you.

05:34.800 --> 05:35.880
Wait a minute.

05:35.880 --> 05:37.960
Just wait till we
finish the fries

05:37.960 --> 05:39.800
then we can all
go together.

05:39.800 --> 05:41.440
What's another
few minutes?

05:41.440 --> 05:42.680
Okay.

05:43.760 --> 05:44.680
All right, one...

05:44.680 --> 05:46.000
Two...

05:46.000 --> 05:47.120
Three!

06:00.680 --> 06:02.040
Well, George

06:02.040 --> 06:04.040
how specific
were you?

06:04.040 --> 06:06.560
"5:47 P.M.,
and not a minute later."

06:06.560 --> 06:07.600
That's specific.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.200
But I've got to tell you

06:09.200 --> 06:12.040
you're not exactly
authoritative sometimes.

06:12.040 --> 06:15.600
I was firm, and now that I think
about it, too generous.

06:15.600 --> 06:18.760
I mean, she knew when she
was supposed to be back

06:18.760 --> 06:20.520
and she's 43 minutes late.

06:20.520 --> 06:23.440
I'm sure your father
was very clear.

06:23.440 --> 06:27.320
Whatever's keeping your sister
better be important.

06:27.320 --> 06:28.680
It's very important.

06:28.680 --> 06:32.080
If you don't tell me what
the thing is, I'll go nuts.

06:32.080 --> 06:33.480
Sorry, Alex, I can't.

06:33.480 --> 06:36.480
If I tell, you'll want
to go, and you can't.

06:36.480 --> 06:37.760
I promise I won't.

06:37.760 --> 06:40.520
Okay, you know the place
by the old warehouse?

06:40.520 --> 06:43.360
They've laid a perfect slab
for roller hockey.

06:43.360 --> 06:45.000
Tomorrow we're
going for it.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.040
That's on the
other side of town

06:47.040 --> 06:48.160
in a creepy area.

06:48.160 --> 06:50.760
Louis says the gangs there
can get rough.

06:50.760 --> 06:51.880
Sounds dangerous.

06:51.880 --> 06:55.520
That's what
makes it a thing.

06:55.520 --> 06:57.400
Alex, don't
give me that look.

06:57.400 --> 06:58.400
You've promised.

06:58.400 --> 06:59.440
What look?

06:59.440 --> 07:01.560
That I'm not going
to say anything

07:01.560 --> 07:03.400
I'll just
give him that look.

07:03.400 --> 07:04.560
I hate that look.

07:04.560 --> 07:06.960
I don't know
what you're talking about.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.200
I guess tomorrow
I'll just stay home

07:09.200 --> 07:10.800
and watch TV
or something.

07:10.800 --> 07:12.360
Alex, stop working on me.

07:12.360 --> 07:13.880
You can't go, all right?

07:13.880 --> 07:16.480
How come you and Louis
can go and I can't?

07:16.480 --> 07:18.560
Because you can't,
you just can't.

07:18.560 --> 07:23.600
Alex, I'm not looking,
so don't even try it.

07:26.480 --> 07:27.640
Hey.

07:29.280 --> 07:30.240
<i>( Door shuts )</i>

07:30.240 --> 07:34.120
I know, I'm a little late,
sorry.

07:34.120 --> 07:37.320
Um, I'm just
going to go upstairs.

07:37.320 --> 07:39.600
Alex, you're an hour late.

07:39.600 --> 07:41.560
If you're late,
you should call.

07:41.560 --> 07:43.160
It only takes a quarter.

07:43.160 --> 07:45.400
I didn't have a quarter,
only a five.

07:45.400 --> 07:48.760
You have to do a lot better
than that, young lady.

07:48.760 --> 07:51.960
I lost track of time.
I'm really sorry, okay?

07:51.960 --> 07:54.520
No, it's not okay.

07:54.520 --> 07:56.000
I said I was sorry.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.040
Do you have to make
such a big deal?

07:58.040 --> 08:00.440
When you say you'll
be home, we expect you.

08:00.440 --> 08:02.920
If not, we're going
to start to worry.

08:02.920 --> 08:05.120
I'm 14!
I can take care of myself.

08:05.120 --> 08:06.280
That's not
the point.

08:06.280 --> 08:07.720
You don't have to worry.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.200
Alex, go
to your room.

08:09.200 --> 08:12.080
We'll be up to speak to you
in a minute.

08:17.080 --> 08:20.880
We're going to have to impose
a little discipline here.

08:20.880 --> 08:22.520
I agree-- 100%.

08:22.520 --> 08:24.640
This is more
than just being late.

08:24.640 --> 08:27.160
It's... it's the principle
of the thing.

08:27.160 --> 08:30.160
When you talk to her,
I suggest being very firm.

08:30.160 --> 08:33.039
Uh-uh, no way, George,
I'm always the bad guy.

08:33.039 --> 08:36.280
This time, the sentencing
is going to come from you.

08:36.280 --> 08:37.440
From me?

08:37.440 --> 08:41.840
Mm-hmm, and I suggest
being very firm.

08:41.840 --> 08:44.280
What is Mom and Dad's
problem, anyway?

08:44.280 --> 08:45.240
<i>( Sighs )</i>

08:45.240 --> 08:46.960
Nothing, just you
completely

08:46.960 --> 08:48.320
ignoring Dad's order.

08:48.320 --> 08:49.280
I didn't
realize

08:49.280 --> 08:51.080
it was that
important to him.

08:51.080 --> 08:52.200
<i>( Phone rings )</i>

08:52.200 --> 08:53.160
Hello?

08:53.160 --> 08:54.160
Hey, it's me.

08:54.160 --> 08:56.040
I pulled strings,
and you're in.

08:56.040 --> 08:58.040
For roller hockey?
You're kidding.

08:58.040 --> 08:59.600
Louis told me
to make sure

08:59.600 --> 09:00.880
you can handle this.

09:00.880 --> 09:02.880
We don't want
to worry about you.

09:02.880 --> 09:04.200
Tell him
not to worry.

09:04.200 --> 09:05.200
I can handle it.

09:05.200 --> 09:06.800
We'll meet
and go together.

09:06.800 --> 09:07.760
Thanks, Ray.

09:07.760 --> 09:08.960
Do you think

Mom and Dad will
let you play roller hockey?

Why not?
I'm a free woman.

09:15.280 --> 09:17.160
Come in.

09:17.160 --> 09:19.400
Alex, your mother and I
have decided

09:19.400 --> 09:21.200
that because of your actions

09:21.200 --> 09:23.160
you're grounded for the weekend.

09:23.160 --> 09:25.800
Grounded?
Just because I was late?

09:25.800 --> 09:27.160
Dad, please.

09:27.160 --> 09:28.920
We have to talk.

09:28.920 --> 09:30.320
I have this thing...

09:30.320 --> 09:33.200
Uh, no, Alex, this time
it's non-negotiable.

09:33.200 --> 09:34.160
Dad!

09:35.240 --> 09:39.800
What were you saying
about being a free woman?

09:51.000 --> 09:54.360
I was just eating French fries
with my friends.

09:54.360 --> 09:58.360
I mean, when is that
a reason to ground someone?

09:58.360 --> 10:02.120
I guess you just pushed Dad
over the edge, and you know

10:02.120 --> 10:03.560
that's not
easy to do.

10:03.560 --> 10:06.360
So, you think he was right
to ground me?

10:06.360 --> 10:07.840
I think it's harsh.

10:07.840 --> 10:10.200
It was, it was very harsh.

10:10.200 --> 10:11.080
He's out of line.

10:11.080 --> 10:12.400

And, unfortunately

you can do about it-- sorry.

your sister doing?

To tell the truth,
she's not a happy camper.

10:30.400 --> 10:32.840
Well, she
violated the rules.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.400
So she messed up.

10:34.400 --> 10:37.400
Why don't you give her
extra chores or something?

10:37.400 --> 10:40.400
Was it really necessary
to ground her?

10:40.400 --> 10:43.920
Uh, uh, uh...
I told her 5:47, Annie.

now I'm too hard.

21:39.120 --> 21:40.080
I hate it.

21:40.080 --> 21:41.480
I'm going crazy.

21:41.480 --> 21:42.960
Yeah, well,
sneaking out--

21:42.960 --> 21:44.480
that was pretty serious.

21:44.480 --> 21:45.440
Yeah, I guess.

21:45.440 --> 21:46.840
I have to admit,
though

21:46.840 --> 21:48.160
I was a little jealous.

21:48.160 --> 21:49.520
Of me, really?

21:49.520 --> 21:51.880
Yeah, I've never done
anything like that.

21:51.880 --> 21:53.400
You made me feel
like I was

21:53.400 --> 21:55.120
wasting my youth
a little bit.

21:55.120 --> 21:57.520
So should we pick up
on that backgammon game?

21:57.520 --> 21:59.480
Nope. I got plans.

21:59.480 --> 22:00.960
<i>You do?</i>

22:00.960 --> 22:03.120
16 years of behaving myself,
Alex...

22:03.120 --> 22:05.640
Things are going to change
a little bit now.
