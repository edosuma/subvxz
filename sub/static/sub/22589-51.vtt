00:10.345 --> 00:14.474
<i>NARRATOR". Midnight in Gotham City,
the very dead of night.</i>

00:14.849 --> 00:20.355
<i>The Green Hornet and Kato outside
the Pink Chip Stamp Factory?</i>

00:20.730 --> 00:26.277
<i>Something must be very much amiss
inside the Pink Chip Stamp Factory...</i>

00:26.444 --> 00:30.073
<i>...for them to invade Batman's territory.</i>

00:30.240 --> 00:33.701
<i>A long way from home, indeed.</i>

00:38.623 --> 00:44.045
<i>And for a peephole to snap shut in their faces
at midnight.</i>

00:44.587 --> 00:46.798
We have visitors, boss.

00:46.965 --> 00:48.883
What? In the middle of my midnight snack?

00:49.050 --> 00:52.762
- I've just warned up this alphabet soup.
-Masked visitors.

00:52.929 --> 00:54.180
Batman and Robin?

00:54.347 --> 00:55.807
Not Batman and Robin.

00:55.974 --> 00:57.350
Who are you? What do you want?

00:57.517 --> 01:00.395
- If you're interested in trading stamps...
-We might be.

01:00.603 --> 01:04.107
...then visit one of our retail outlets
in the morning. This is the factory.

01:04.274 --> 01:08.653
That sign on the outer door,
"This means you," means you.

01:08.820 --> 01:10.405
Throw them out.

01:17.161 --> 01:20.999
- Why leave? We had them reeling.
-We saw enough, Kato.

01:21.207 --> 01:23.960
I think at last we've found
what we've been looking for.

01:24.127 --> 01:26.963
Tomorrow night we'll wrap everything up.

01:32.552 --> 01:35.930
<i>NARRATOR".
Then, in the rosy-fingered morn...</i>

01:41.477 --> 01:44.272
Who were your two visitors last night,
Colonel Gumm?

01:44.439 --> 01:47.442
Just a couple of hoods, Miss Pinkston.

01:47.609 --> 01:49.485
I chased them away.

01:49.652 --> 01:54.574
Hoods, Colonel Gumm?
In fancy clothes and a big black limousine?

01:54.741 --> 01:57.452
I saw them arrive
through my apartment window.

01:57.619 --> 02:00.747
But, of course, it was too late to come down.

02:07.629 --> 02:11.299
Commissioner Gordon, please.
This is Pinky Pinkston calling.

02:11.466 --> 02:12.925
No, Miss Pinkston.

02:13.384 --> 02:17.513
Colonel Gumm doesn't seem to understand
that I own this factory, Apricot.

02:17.680 --> 02:20.767
He may be the foreman, but I am the boss.

02:20.933 --> 02:23.603
Let the police handle the masked intruders,
Colonel Gumm.

02:23.770 --> 02:27.440
You have enough to do
printing Pink Chip stamps.

02:27.607 --> 02:29.400
Hello, Miss Pinkston. What can I do for you?

02:29.776 --> 02:33.738
Two strange men invaded my factory
last night, commissioner.

02:33.905 --> 02:35.281
My foreman threw them out...

02:35.448 --> 02:39.744
...but I'm running a legitimate business here
and I may need your help.

02:39.911 --> 02:42.538
Well, of course.
Can you describe the interlopers?

02:44.540 --> 02:46.084
What?

02:47.001 --> 02:48.252
What?

02:49.754 --> 02:53.925
<i>NARRATOR". While from a pink factory
with a green intruder...</i>

02:54.092 --> 02:57.970
<i>...we go to brick-colored
Stately Wayne Manor...</i>

02:58.137 --> 02:59.972
<i>...and a red Batphone.</i>

03:02.684 --> 03:07.271
This new stamp you've added
to your collection is beautiful, Bruce.

03:07.438 --> 03:12.151
Supposedly, it's a very rare issue.
The famous Blue Boar of Russian Samara.

03:12.318 --> 03:16.197
But I have my doubts about the watermark.

03:16.364 --> 03:17.657
Watermark?

03:17.824 --> 03:20.410
- Yes, this one's barely visible.
-Ahem.

03:21.619 --> 03:24.872
- Yes, Alfred?
-The red phone, sir.

03:25.665 --> 03:30.044
Dick, perhaps we can give Blue Boar a closer
examination under the microscope in the study.

03:30.211 --> 03:31.337
Oh, Bruce...

03:31.504 --> 03:35.049
...don't forget you have a luncheon date
with that sweet Miss Pinkston.

03:36.676 --> 03:38.678
Yes, Aunt Harriet.

03:39.387 --> 03:41.139
Hello?

03:42.056 --> 03:43.641
Britt Reid?

03:43.808 --> 03:47.895
Yes, Mrs. Cooper. I'm in Gotham City
for the newspaper-publisher's convention.

03:48.062 --> 03:50.398
Wanted to say hello to you
and speak to Bruce.

03:50.606 --> 03:52.567
Just a moment, Mr. Reid.

03:52.775 --> 03:55.403
- Alfred...
-Oh, yes, madam.

03:55.611 --> 03:58.197
- Yes, commissioner?
-We have strong reason to believe...

03:58.364 --> 04:01.576
...that arch-criminal, the Green Hornet,
is operating in Gotham City.

04:01.743 --> 04:05.705
- We'll run wide open. To the Bat--
-Sorry to interrupt you at a moment like this.

04:05.872 --> 04:09.333
But Mr. Britt Reid is on the other telephone.
He's in town and would like--

04:09.500 --> 04:13.212
Find out where he's staying and tell him
I'll call him later. To the Batpoles.

04:15.000 --> 04:21.074

05:25.409 --> 05:29.413
<i>NARRATOR". But while the Dynamic Duo
head for Commissioner Gordon's office...</i>

05:29.580 --> 05:31.332
<i>...in double quick time...</i>

05:31.499 --> 05:36.254
<i>...Britt Reid's making a little time of his own,
or trying to.</i>

05:36.420 --> 05:39.215
What do you mean
you have a luncheon date with Bruce Wayne?

05:39.382 --> 05:42.385
It's the only free time I have
during the publisher's convention.

05:42.552 --> 05:45.471
Well, I do, Britt. And I can't break it.

05:45.638 --> 05:49.851
Why don't you join us, Britt?
After all, Bruce is a friend of yours too.

05:50.017 --> 05:52.186
Mm-hm. Not where you're concerned, Pinky.

05:52.353 --> 05:54.230
I thrive on rivalry.

05:54.397 --> 05:57.650
So don't be stubborn.
The Camellia Room, 12:30?

05:58.276 --> 05:59.944
All right. You'll know me.

06:00.111 --> 06:02.280
<i>I'll be the one dressed
as a green-eyed monster.</i>

06:04.282 --> 06:07.326
- Guess you can't win them all, Mr. Reid.
-Hm.

06:07.952 --> 06:10.413
Ever since Bruce Wayne and I were kids...

06:10.580 --> 06:12.707
...we've been rivals in one way or another.

06:14.250 --> 06:21.090
The newspapers, the radio, TV, Mayor Linseed,
Governor Stonefellow, all on my back...

06:21.257 --> 06:27.847
...because the rumor is out the Green Hornet
is in our fair city for a piece of the action.

06:28.014 --> 06:31.350
A piece of the action
at the Pink Chip Stamps Factory.

06:32.184 --> 06:34.645
That seems strange.

06:34.812 --> 06:36.981
With this heinous reputation
for high stakes...

06:37.148 --> 06:41.611
...a out of a trading-stamps factory
would seem like somewhat of a comedown.

06:42.153 --> 06:47.033
Maybe he was looking for something else
at the Pink Chip Stamp Factory, Batman.

06:47.199 --> 06:50.161
The Gotham Gothic?

06:50.369 --> 06:53.789
Miss Pinkston's father, Pincus Pinkston...

06:54.498 --> 06:55.917
May he rest in peace.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.794
...was one of Gotham City's foremost
stamp collectors.

06:58.961 --> 07:03.341
And the most valuable stamp in his collection
was the famous Gotham Gothic.

07:03.507 --> 07:05.635
Sure. Worth a fortune.

07:05.801 --> 07:09.138
But it disappeared mysteriously
shortly after he died.

07:11.057 --> 07:12.058
Yes, Bonnie?

07:12.892 --> 07:14.852
Oh, send him in, Bonnie.

07:16.437 --> 07:18.606
An important out-of-town
newspaper publisher...

07:18.773 --> 07:21.692
...who I'm sure would be honored
to meet you, Batman.

07:21.859 --> 07:24.654
Ah, Mr. Reid.

07:27.907 --> 07:28.950
- Commissioner.
-Come in.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.701
- Good to see you.
-Good to see you.

07:30.868 --> 07:33.996
And luck would have it, our famed
Caped Crusaders, Batman and Robin.

07:34.163 --> 07:35.831
- Batman.
-Welcome, Mr. Reid.

07:35.998 --> 07:37.541
- Thank you. Robin.
-How do you do?

07:37.708 --> 07:40.419
- Sit down. Make yourself at home.
-Thank you, commissioner.

07:40.586 --> 07:43.381
We have a mutual friend, Batman.

07:43.547 --> 07:47.051
Millionaire Bruce Wayne.
In fact, I'm having lunch with him today.

07:47.218 --> 07:49.595
Oh? Give him my regards.

07:50.304 --> 07:54.433
We were just discussing a criminal, Mr. Reid,
with whom you are no doubt familiar.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.852
The Green Hornet, from your own bailiwick.

07:57.019 --> 07:59.105
Just between us boys, Mr. Reid...

07:59.271 --> 08:03.609
...we have reason to suspect he'll be pulling
some shenanigans in our own bailiwick.

08:03.776 --> 08:06.904
The Green Hornet? In Gotham City?

08:07.488 --> 08:12.284
Well, that shouldn't disturb you, Batman.
Your name is legend among crime fighters.

08:13.786 --> 08:16.998
Legends are sometimes highly overrated,
Mr. Reid.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.875
'Twill be the Green Hornet
who's overrated, Batman...

08:20.042 --> 08:22.169
...if he tries to tangle with you and Robin.

08:22.670 --> 08:25.172
For which we must prepare ourselves.

08:25.339 --> 08:28.342
- Excuse us, Mr. Reid.
-Of course.

08:28.509 --> 08:30.803
We must get back to the Batcave.

08:30.970 --> 08:31.971
Sure, Batman.

08:32.138 --> 08:36.100
Maybe the Batcomputer can tell us a little more
about our pea-green adversary.

08:40.354 --> 08:44.567
I'm very disappointed in these, Reprint.

08:44.734 --> 08:47.737
For someone who's advanced
from manufacturing Pink Chip stamps...

08:47.903 --> 08:50.740
...to the fine art of counterfeiting
priceless rare stamps...

08:50.906 --> 08:54.702
...your work has become very slipshod.
Here, look at this overprint. Tsk, tsk, tsk.

08:54.869 --> 08:57.329
Fuzzy. Any expert could spot that.

08:57.496 --> 08:59.874
- So I goofed.
-Which we cannot afford, Reprint.

09:00.041 --> 09:03.127
We have a lot to do in a very short time.

09:03.544 --> 09:06.422
- How short, Colonel Gumm?
-Tonight and tomorrow, Cancelled.

09:06.589 --> 09:08.549
Then we move everything
into the warehouse.

09:08.716 --> 09:11.552
Tomorrow night is the great
International Stamps Exhibition...

09:11.719 --> 09:15.222
...where I plan to make my big kill.

09:16.390 --> 09:18.309
You sure ought to win some of the prizes.

09:18.517 --> 09:20.770
Winning prizes is not what I'm after, Block.

09:20.936 --> 09:24.982
It's walking away with some of the rarest
and most irreplaceable stamps in the world.

09:26.317 --> 09:30.529
Whoops, oops! There comes the pink
prima donna. Down her private stairway.

09:30.696 --> 09:34.241
Look busy and honest.

09:52.301 --> 09:53.636
Colonel Gumm.

09:53.803 --> 09:58.808
- Have you heard the latest news broadcast?
-No, Miss Pinkston. I've been too busy.

09:58.974 --> 10:01.060
Oh, isn't that a shame, Apricot?

10:01.227 --> 10:04.814
Colonel Gumm has been too busy
manufacturing Pink Chip stamps...

10:04.980 --> 10:07.608
...to know that this morning's intruders
may have been...

10:07.775 --> 10:10.611
...the Green Hornet
and his masked accomplice.

10:10.778 --> 10:13.948
Uh, what would they be doing
in Gotham City?

10:14.490 --> 10:18.327
What would they be doing in my factory,
Apricot?

10:26.502 --> 10:28.754
I will be lunching in town, Colonel Gumm.

10:37.680 --> 10:41.058
I wish she'd stop talking to that pink mutt
and talk to me.

10:41.225 --> 10:44.520
- I think she was talking to you, boss.
-Well, I'll soon find out.

10:44.687 --> 10:46.230
How, colonel?

10:46.397 --> 10:49.650
As you boys grow older
and more experienced...

10:49.817 --> 10:55.030
...you'll find there's more than one way
to skin a pink cat.

11:01.495 --> 11:04.874
Fine time for the Batcomputer
to let us down.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.876
It's not the machine's fault, old chum.

11:07.084 --> 11:09.587
We overlooked one thing
when we constructed it.

11:09.753 --> 11:12.131
A dual-identity Bat-sensor.

11:12.298 --> 11:13.799
Holy oversight.

11:13.966 --> 11:16.552
So we can't really blame
our faithful friend here...

11:16.719 --> 11:20.264
...for failing to provide us
with the clues we need about the Green Hornet.

11:20.431 --> 11:24.185
No human mind has solved the secret
of our own duplicity.

11:25.102 --> 11:29.398
Who, in reality, are Batman and Robin.

11:31.192 --> 11:32.651
It heard you. It's trying.

11:37.615 --> 11:38.908
Not much of an answer.

11:39.074 --> 11:42.203
"Cowled crime fighters.
Real identities unknown."

11:42.745 --> 11:48.125
The next time we're in town, we'll pick up
the parts for a dual-identity Bat-sensor.

11:48.542 --> 11:52.296
Now it's time for Bruce Wayne's lunch date
with Pinky Pinkston...

11:52.463 --> 11:55.674
...and Dick Grayson's session
with his French tutor.

11:55.841 --> 11:57.468
French tutor?

11:57.635 --> 12:00.429
That's one trouble with dual identities,
Robin.

12:00.596 --> 12:03.766
Dual responsibilities.

12:22.910 --> 12:25.829
Oh, that is beautiful. Beautiful.

12:25.996 --> 12:28.332
- What's it called?
-Shirley.

12:28.540 --> 12:30.167
A peignoir named Shirley?

12:30.334 --> 12:32.753
No, I'm Shirley.

12:32.920 --> 12:36.006
Lingerie Bazaar. Off at 6.

12:37.841 --> 12:40.886
We're completely neglecting Britt.

12:41.053 --> 12:44.014
No, I got the message, Pinky.

12:44.181 --> 12:47.017
Would I supply the third corner
of today's triangle...

12:47.184 --> 12:50.062
...to tell you what I might know about
the Green Hornet.

12:51.730 --> 12:54.441
Yes, very lovely. What size is it?

12:54.650 --> 13:00.906
555-5555.

13:01.073 --> 13:07.204
Size 5,555,555?

13:07.413 --> 13:10.332
No. That's my telephone number.

13:10.499 --> 13:12.251
Ask for June.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.546
I do wish you two would quit flirting
with the models...

13:15.713 --> 13:17.673
...and pay a little attention to me.

13:17.840 --> 13:21.093
Britt's doing all the flirting.
I'm outside feeding the dog.

13:21.885 --> 13:25.264
You can't expect me to devote
my entire time to you, Bruce.

13:26.056 --> 13:28.642
- Why not?
- Because Britt's here too.

13:28.809 --> 13:30.394
That's right, I am.

13:32.938 --> 13:34.523
Well, where were we?

13:35.733 --> 13:40.237
I'll line up Batman in case Green Hornet
decides to invade your factory tonight.

13:40.404 --> 13:44.325
And I'm to find out
what the Green Hornet is up to in Gotham City.

13:44.491 --> 13:48.454
Oh, will you?
I have so much at stake at that factory.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.497
I don't want any trouble.

13:50.664 --> 13:52.708
I'll deliver Batman.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.752
If I can reach him, of course.

13:54.918 --> 14:00.132
And all information on the Green Hornet
will be transmitted. If I can get any.

14:00.299 --> 14:02.217
But aren't you mixing business--?

14:02.384 --> 14:04.094
With pleasure, Pinky?

14:04.261 --> 14:07.139
Business is my pleasure, darlings.

14:07.306 --> 14:08.766
Thank you.

14:08.932 --> 14:11.935
Well, Apricot, time for your pedicure.

14:14.480 --> 14:17.775
- Come on, Apricot.
-You boys can fight over the check.

14:17.941 --> 14:19.610
- Good day.
-Bye, Pinky.

14:19.777 --> 14:21.904
Good day, Pinky.

14:23.405 --> 14:25.657
Whose idea was this?

14:26.241 --> 14:30.579
Pinky invited me to lunch,
and you invited her. Thank you.

14:33.207 --> 14:34.458
- I'm sorry, sir.
-Mm, mm?

14:34.625 --> 14:38.504
The only alphabet soup we have
is tomato, split-pea and clam chowder.

14:38.670 --> 14:42.841
Oh, too bad.
You colonials are still so uncivilized.

14:43.008 --> 14:46.678
Well, I suppose I must go elsewhere.

14:51.350 --> 14:53.102
I have to drop by my stamp dealer's.

14:53.268 --> 14:55.729
He's a nice old gentleman
named Boris Sevaroff.

14:55.896 --> 14:58.899
Though I think he sold me a bogus
Blue Boar from Russian Samara.

14:59.650 --> 15:02.069
I've been having the same trouble
with my collection.

15:02.236 --> 15:05.614
Paid a fancy price for some stamps
that I don't think have a fancy value.

15:05.781 --> 15:07.950
- Why don't you come along?
-Sure. Love to.

15:08.117 --> 15:11.412
I don't have anything to do tonight
until the publisher's convention.

15:11.578 --> 15:14.832
I'd invite you to that but,
uh, it's closed to visitors.

15:14.998 --> 15:16.083
Same with me.

15:16.250 --> 15:20.712
Meeting of the Wayne Foundation.
Board members only.

15:28.345 --> 15:32.141
Ooh, da, da! Yes, of course, Mr. Wayne.

15:32.307 --> 15:36.895
The watermark on your Blue Boar stamp
is indistinct, but naturally.

15:37.062 --> 15:41.483
Do you realize that only 12 of those stamps
were ever printed?

15:41.650 --> 15:44.486
And that was over 100 years ago.

15:44.653 --> 15:49.324
And, of course,
Russian Samara is a long way off.

15:49.491 --> 15:55.122
Ah, Mr. Wayne, who knows how far
that stamp had to travel...

15:55.289 --> 15:58.500
...and what enormous perils
it went through...

15:58.667 --> 16:03.881
...before it finally found its way
to my poor establishment?

16:04.047 --> 16:07.968
Not quite as poor as it was
the day before yesterday, Mr. Sevaroff...

16:08.135 --> 16:11.221
...when I paid a rather handsome price
for the Blue Boar.

16:11.847 --> 16:13.765
I just hope that you are right.

16:13.932 --> 16:19.062
Are you implying that I hoodwinked you,
Mr. Wayne? That I sold you a fake?

16:19.897 --> 16:23.817
No, of course not. But isn't it possible
that you were hoodwinked?

16:25.194 --> 16:29.364
Nobody hoodwinks Boris Sevaroff.

16:29.531 --> 16:31.200
Speaking of valuable stamps...

16:31.366 --> 16:34.036
...have you ever noticed
a stamp called the Gotham Gothic?

16:34.453 --> 16:37.164
It used to be in the collection
of a Mr. Pincus Pinkston...

16:37.331 --> 16:39.625
...but upon his death, it vanished.

16:40.167 --> 16:44.296
Well, of course, I have heard of this stamp,
Mr. Wayne...

16:44.463 --> 16:50.010
...but you must remember what a very small
and perishable thing a single stamp is.

16:50.177 --> 16:55.098
It might easily have gotten lost
or accidentally destroyed.

16:55.265 --> 16:58.477
Yes, most likely. I just thought I'd ask.

16:58.727 --> 17:02.356
Ha-ha-ha, well, gentleman.

17:02.814 --> 17:05.400
Gentlemen, a true pleasure to serve you.

17:05.567 --> 17:07.653
And I hope I have the opportunity
once more...

17:07.819 --> 17:10.948
...before I return to my home,
Volzhsky on the Volga.

17:11.114 --> 17:15.035
Good day. Good day. Good day.

17:23.001 --> 17:24.711
- Reprint?
- Yes, boss?

17:24.877 --> 17:28.214
Shift into high gear. We have to move
to the warehouse sooner than I thought.

17:28.382 --> 17:30.634
The pink neb's causing problems again?

17:30.801 --> 17:32.261
She's just one of my headaches.

17:32.427 --> 17:34.805
- I really smell trouble this time.
-Too bad, boss.

17:34.972 --> 17:40.394
But you'll flip when you see my last batch
of phony stamps. Not fuzzy at all.

17:48.151 --> 17:51.196
<i>NARRATOR". But Colonel Gumm
isn't the only one who smells trouble...</i>

17:51.363 --> 17:56.201
<i>...as he ends Boris Sevaroff's day's activities.</i>

17:56.368 --> 18:01.290
<i>And Britt Reid begins
the Green Hornet's evening intrigue.</i>

18:01.456 --> 18:05.419
I'm certain that Bruce Wayne's
slippery stamp dealer...

18:05.711 --> 18:08.839
...and the foreman of the Pink Chip
Stamps Factory are the same man.

18:09.006 --> 18:11.633
Involved in the counterfeit-stamp ring
we're trying to crack?

18:11.800 --> 18:14.636
Undoubtedly knowing something
about the missing Gotham Gothic.

18:14.803 --> 18:18.265
I have a feeling that Batman and Robin
are gonna be on our tails tonight...

18:18.432 --> 18:21.018
...making our task that much more tricky.
-How so?

18:21.184 --> 18:25.564
Well, to the world at large, they're known as
the Caped Crusaders. Fearless crime fighters.

18:25.731 --> 18:27.816
Whereas,
due to the nature of our operation...

18:27.983 --> 18:30.402
...the same world at large looks on us
as criminals.

18:30.569 --> 18:32.279
Only a very few know different.

18:32.446 --> 18:35.449
Hm. Sure does sound tricky.

18:35.991 --> 18:39.745
So I'll turn my Hornet's Sting
to half maximum power.

18:39.911 --> 18:42.831
I don't wanna get careless
and hurt Batman if we clash.

18:42.998 --> 18:45.500
- Well, you always have your gas gun.
-Right.

18:45.667 --> 18:48.045
And nothing must stop us
from gaining our ends.

18:48.211 --> 18:50.881
<i>NARRATOR".
So to the battlefield.</i>

18:51.465 --> 18:53.508
<i>And</i> speaking of warfare...

18:53.675 --> 18:55.594
Now, don't lie to me, Colonel Gumm.

18:55.761 --> 18:58.680
I know what I've heard
and I know what I've seen since.

18:58.847 --> 19:02.476
All I don't know is
how I could've been so blind for so long.

19:02.643 --> 19:06.605
- Now, the first thing we're going to do--
-ls to lock you up, Miss Pinkston.

19:07.439 --> 19:09.524
In my office for now.

19:09.691 --> 19:13.654
We'll take her to the warehouse later on.
First, we have to wind things up here.

19:18.617 --> 19:23.747
And then to make my big kill
at the stamp exhibition tomorrow night.

19:34.341 --> 19:37.594
No sign of Black Beauty, Robin.
We must have beaten it here.

19:37.761 --> 19:41.098
There's an alley around the corner.
We can hide the car there.

19:54.778 --> 19:56.780
No Batmobile. Good.

19:56.947 --> 20:00.325
We can get some work done first, and fast.

20:09.167 --> 20:11.878
Holy split seconds. Let's go.

20:12.170 --> 20:14.131
Easy, old chum.

20:14.715 --> 20:18.301
I chanced to notice an open window
back there.

20:19.761 --> 20:22.472
That sign on the door, "This means you"--

20:22.639 --> 20:26.351
- Shall we say, "This means us"?
-Us?

20:26.518 --> 20:28.019
You should know who I am by now.

20:28.186 --> 20:31.148
How about cutting me in
on a little piece of the action?

20:31.314 --> 20:33.358
How big a piece?

20:33.525 --> 20:34.901
That depends...

20:35.068 --> 20:39.448
...on how much a stamp dealer
named Boris Sevaroff...

20:39.614 --> 20:42.534
...can get for the missing Gotham Gothic.

20:43.034 --> 20:44.953
See, I know more about you
than you think.

20:45.120 --> 20:46.663
We can take them all, Batman.

20:46.830 --> 20:49.875
That's a very sophisticated-looking
piece of machinery.

20:50.041 --> 20:55.046
Yes, it's my own invention.
The enlarged perforating and coiling machine.

20:55.213 --> 20:58.091
Why not give it a closer look?

20:58.717 --> 21:00.552
All right.

21:07.726 --> 21:10.187
He's not showing them the machinery,
he's tossing them into it.

21:10.353 --> 21:12.981
The Green Hornet may posses the only clue
to this baffling case.

21:13.148 --> 21:17.486
You know my motto, boys.
"Always stamp out evil."

21:17.652 --> 21:20.280
- Boss, look.
-We move.

21:20.447 --> 21:24.576
Let's give them a thorough pasting.
Come on, boys.

22:09.788 --> 22:11.414
Holy flypaper, Batman.

22:19.965 --> 22:24.261
We've all heard how the Dynamic Duo
sticks together through thick and thin.

22:24.427 --> 22:28.139
But this time, you're really stuck, Batman...

22:28.306 --> 22:30.725
...on an undetachable glue pad.

22:30.892 --> 22:33.186
While the Green Hornet
and his masked companion...

22:33.353 --> 22:38.108
...are being blocked, gummed,
and perforated in that machine.

22:42.863 --> 22:45.532
You satanic, mad stamp man.

22:45.699 --> 22:48.702
Satanic, Batman? Who knows?

22:48.869 --> 22:53.748
But mad stamp man, perhaps.
Ha-ha-ha!

22:53.915 --> 22:56.459
Behold, even as we speak...

22:56.626 --> 23:01.673
...my machine is producing
a very rare stamp indeed.

23:05.176 --> 23:08.597
Ah! Wonderful.

23:08.805 --> 23:14.519
Shall we call him the Green Hornet'?
The only stamp of its kind ever printed.

23:14.686 --> 23:18.982
I'm sure it would be a collector's item,
if it were not for its size.

23:19.149 --> 23:23.403
Ah, the Green Hornet makes such
a wonderful, beautiful stamp...

23:23.570 --> 23:27.115
...that I think I'll thumb-tack him to the wall.

23:27.532 --> 23:29.618
Holy human collectors item.

23:29.784 --> 23:31.369
Exactly, Boy Wonder.

23:31.536 --> 23:33.788
As soon as I tack up the other
masked marauder...

23:33.955 --> 23:36.708
...who is even now being perforated
in that machine...

23:36.875 --> 23:40.170
...then it will be your turns, Dynamic Duo.

23:40.337 --> 23:43.089
Yes, I know you've faced
many deadly perils...

23:43.256 --> 23:45.216
...and escaped in many devious manners...

23:45.383 --> 23:49.846
...but you have never been so close
to being completely stamped out...

23:50.013 --> 23:52.182
...as you are right now.
