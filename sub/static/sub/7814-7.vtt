is so bracing.

02:19.709 --> 02:21.709
It gets me primed
for learning.

02:21.709 --> 02:25.291
That's why I had Daddy call

And remember,
everyone just sits still

02:36.291 --> 02:38.792
We must always
keep safety first.

Especially when we're
going up a giant ramp.

Huh. No worries.
I'll just call Daddy,

No signal?

03:41.041 --> 03:43.166
No phone? No radio?

03:43.166 --> 03:47.583
It's like we slid back

Okay, okay.
Calm down, all of you.

03:54.208 --> 03:56.792
As class president,
I am in charge.

Our first and most important

Who in the world
would build a snow ramp

04:06.583 --> 04:07.750
Who hasn't?

04:10.583 --> 04:13.834
[sniffs]
Okay, I did it.

04:13.834 --> 04:16.917
But I'm going to do
something about it.
I'll lead us out of here.

04:16.917 --> 04:19.750
Because when Kick Buttowski
says he's gonna save
everyone on the bus,

04:19.750 --> 04:22.667
he darn well saves
everyone on the bus.

04:22.667 --> 04:24.834
So who's with me?

04:24.834 --> 04:25.834
No one!

04:28.291 --> 04:31.792
As president of the Snowy Bus
Crash Preparedness Team,

04:31.792 --> 04:33.959
I'm trained for just
such a situation.

Protocol dictates
we stay put until help arrives.

04:36.583 --> 04:38.750
Or until we freeze solid.
Whichever comes first.

04:38.750 --> 04:41.583
Well, I'm president and chair
of the Awesome Rescue
People Team,

04:41.583 --> 04:43.166

04:43.166 --> 04:44.500

Fine.

05:12.125 --> 05:15.375
Gunther, we need something
powerful to pull us out of this.

05:15.375 --> 05:17.333
We need a tow truck.
We need--

06:02.709 --> 06:04.667
No one ever makes it.

06:04.667 --> 06:06.250
We're gonna starve.

Not if I ration our food.

and a monkey.
[laughs]

13:22.458 --> 13:24.000
It's a chimp,
jack-ball.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.083
Everybody knows
that anthropods without tails--

13:26.083 --> 13:27.417
Zip it, dill weed.

13:27.417 --> 13:29.875
Hand over the frozen treatage,
and nobody gets hurt,

13:29.875 --> 13:30.875
much.

13:32.208 --> 13:34.041
[chittering]

13:35.625 --> 13:38.500
[Boy screaming]
Help!

13:38.500 --> 13:41.417
[screams, yelling]

13:41.417 --> 13:42.583
[crash]

13:42.583 --> 13:43.959
[teeth chattering]

13:48.291 --> 13:50.583
[chittering]

13:53.792 --> 13:55.166
[all laughing]

13:55.166 --> 13:58.333
Dr. Awesome is going to be
the best pet ever.

13:58.333 --> 13:59.709
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:59.709 --> 14:02.291
You aren't thinking of keeping
Dr. Awesome, are you?

14:02.291 --> 14:04.959
I never think, Gunther,
I do.

14:04.959 --> 14:06.542
But your folks said
they'd ground you

14:06.542 --> 14:08.625
if you brought home
any more strays.

14:08.625 --> 14:09.834
Remember?

14:13.375 --> 14:15.208
[panting]

14:16.750 --> 14:18.834
[yowling]

14:23.166 --> 14:25.166
[chittering]

14:26.375 --> 14:29.291
Remember?

14:29.291 --> 14:30.333
[chittering]

14:30.333 --> 14:33.667
Relax, Gunther.
I got this.

14:33.667 --> 14:36.583
All we gotta do is keep
giving him bananas
to keep him calm,

14:36.583 --> 14:38.375
and no one
will even notice.

14:38.375 --> 14:40.041
Are you sure?

14:40.041 --> 14:41.834
Of course I am.

14:41.834 --> 14:44.291
Chimps are awesome.

14:44.291 --> 14:48.208
But how can we disguise him
to sneak him into the house?

14:50.709 --> 14:52.542
[Gunther]
That steely gaze,

14:52.542 --> 14:56.542
that stance,
that signature pose...

14:56.542 --> 14:58.875
I got nothing.

15:00.166 --> 15:02.375
[Mother humming]

15:06.083 --> 15:07.875
Oh, dear!

15:09.709 --> 15:13.208
You're looking
a skosh pudgy, Mister.

15:14.667 --> 15:16.208
[chitters]

15:16.208 --> 15:17.834
Hmm. That's better.

15:17.834 --> 15:20.500
Thank you for your concern.
I'm going to my room.
Hold my calls.

15:20.500 --> 15:23.250
Yes, well, just in case,
no desserts for a while.

15:23.250 --> 15:24.583
[chittering]

15:27.375 --> 15:28.875
[chittering continues]

15:37.166 --> 15:39.083
O-kay.

15:40.083 --> 15:41.417
[chittering]

15:41.417 --> 15:43.875
Ah-ah-ah.
You know the rules.

15:43.875 --> 15:47.166
While Daddy's watching TV,
there'll be no
monkeying a-- Ooh.

15:47.166 --> 15:49.917
Wow. You're really
growing up fast, Kick.

15:49.917 --> 15:50.917
[chittering continues]

15:52.375 --> 15:53.875
Gotta go.

15:55.250 --> 15:58.542
Uh, Kick ate
some lingonberry
burritos for lunch.

15:58.542 --> 15:59.542
[bubbling]

15:59.542 --> 16:00.875
[fart]
[chuckles]

16:00.875 --> 16:02.917
So did I. Bye.

16:05.583 --> 16:06.583
[bubbling]

16:11.000 --> 16:14.500
[sniffing]
Ew! Something smells.

16:14.500 --> 16:15.750
[chittering]

16:15.750 --> 16:19.000
Oh, that reminds me.
I need to shower.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.458
[door closes]

16:21.458 --> 16:23.834
[Kick]
Well, Gunther,
mission accomplished.

16:23.834 --> 16:27.875
We got him into the house,
and now I've got a monkey
for a pet.

16:27.875 --> 16:30.959
From now on,
life is gonna be perfect.

16:30.959 --> 16:34.083
[chittering]

16:34.083 --> 16:37.166
Gunther, get this gentleman
some bananas.

16:37.166 --> 16:40.458
Those were for Dr. Awesome?
But I ate them all.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.125
Say what?
[chittering intensifies]

16:42.125 --> 16:44.333
Monkey stampede!

16:45.667 --> 16:47.625
Hurry, Gunther,
before anyone sees them.

16:47.625 --> 16:49.667
[chittering continues]
[thudding]

16:49.667 --> 16:51.166
[squeaking]

17:00.000 --> 17:01.709
[screams]

17:02.875 --> 17:04.083
I can't believe--

17:04.083 --> 17:06.041
[muttering]
...custom-made...

17:06.041 --> 17:07.333
[chittering]

17:07.333 --> 17:10.000
The bedroom.
He'll rat me out for sure.

17:14.166 --> 17:16.250
Where'd he go?
[clearing throat]

17:16.250 --> 17:18.417
What are you doing
in my room, dill weed?

17:18.417 --> 17:20.583
Uh...

17:20.583 --> 17:22.500
[screeches]
What was that?

17:22.500 --> 17:24.375
Out of my way!

17:24.375 --> 17:26.667
Now, what was that?

17:26.667 --> 17:28.250
What the--
[screams]

17:30.250 --> 17:32.625
The tap water--
it burns!

17:32.625 --> 17:35.917
[chittering]
[yelling]

17:35.917 --> 17:37.917
[blows landing]

17:37.917 --> 17:38.959
[weakly]
Chimp.

17:40.542 --> 17:43.000
Oh, Harold,
what a pleasant surprise.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.208
[quietly]
No, Dr. Awesome. Out.

17:45.208 --> 17:46.875
Kick, did you say something?

17:46.875 --> 17:49.750
I said,
"Oh, that is so awesome

17:49.750 --> 17:51.417
that Dad is giving you
a massage."

17:51.417 --> 17:52.875
[kissing]

17:54.166 --> 17:57.375
Oh, Harold!
What an animal.

17:58.166 --> 18:01.250
Come on, Mellowbrook!
Play fair! And have fun.

18:01.250 --> 18:03.166
[thudding]
[chittering]

18:03.166 --> 18:06.542
Yeah, yeah.
Stop walking, honey.

18:14.125 --> 18:15.917
[growling]

18:24.959 --> 18:25.959
[gulping]

18:27.500 --> 18:28.500
Blaah!

18:28.500 --> 18:30.500
Gotta barf. Bye.

18:30.500 --> 18:33.417
Kick, what did I tell you
about drinking from Daddy's cup?

18:34.542 --> 18:37.917
He's outside.
What'll we do now?

18:37.917 --> 18:39.417
It's only one chimp,
Gunther.

18:39.417 --> 18:42.166
<i>A breaking news update</i>
<i>on the escaped chimp.</i>

18:42.166 --> 18:44.917
<i>Dozens of other chimps</i>
<i>have now escaped</i>
<i>from their exhibit at the zoo,</i>

18:44.917 --> 18:47.041
<i>presumably in search</i>
<i>of their leader.</i>

18:47.041 --> 18:50.625
<i>Be warned: A chimp</i>
<i>will stop at nothing</i>
<i>to save its patriarch.</i>

18:50.625 --> 18:52.625
Well, that was unexpected.

18:52.625 --> 18:55.625
Uh, Kick,
we got company.

18:55.625 --> 18:56.959
[chittering]
[screams]

18:56.959 --> 18:59.709

[Woman screaming]

19:02.417 --> 19:03.625

19:07.709 --> 19:09.291
Eh...

19:09.291 --> 19:11.959
Eh, eh...
[whimpers]

19:11.959 --> 19:14.083
Kick, this is crazy!

19:14.083 --> 19:16.000
We can't
handle this alone!

19:18.291 --> 19:21.500
We gotta get these chimps
back to the zoo. But how?

19:21.500 --> 19:24.667
We gotta think
of something quick!
This is bananas!

19:24.667 --> 19:25.959
Got it.

19:26.959 --> 19:29.083
Okay. Bye.

19:29.083 --> 19:30.709
Hold up, banana man.

19:32.375 --> 19:35.041
Keep chumming.
Bananas are the only things

19:35.041 --> 19:37.166
they love more than chaos.

Look!

[Pac-Man sounds]

20:15.417 --> 20:17.792
[screaming]

20:34.792 --> 20:36.667
Well, we did it together.

20:36.667 --> 20:39.500
Every chimp is
back in their friendly and
accommodating environment.

20:41.250 --> 20:43.583
Speaking of home,
I'd hate to be there

20:43.583 --> 20:46.709
when you face the wrath
of your family and neighbors

20:46.709 --> 20:50.625
for unleashing
massive chimp mayhem
upon all of Mellowbrook.

20:50.625 --> 20:53.417
[gasps]
You're right.
I can't go back there.

20:53.417 --> 20:55.959
Where will I go?
How will I live?

20:55.959 --> 20:58.458
Mmm.

20:58.458 --> 21:03.083
<i>And the missing chimps</i>
<i>are all mysteriously back</i>
<i>in the zoo again.</i>

21:03.083 --> 21:04.959
<i>In a completely</i>
<i>unrelated story,</i>

<i>two human boys</i>

21:08.625 --> 21:09.750
<i>Interesting.</i>

21:09.750 --> 21:11.500
[laughs]
Oh, who could ever

21:11.500 --> 21:13.500
mistake a human for a chimp?

21:13.500 --> 21:15.625
Here's Daddy's cup.
Mwah.
