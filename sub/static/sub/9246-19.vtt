WEBVTT

00:02.611 --> 00:04.917
Listen, you two,
I stuck my neck out

00:05.005 --> 00:06.484
so you could get married here.

00:06.571 --> 00:08.878
And if your interview
with Father Tim goes South

00:08.965 --> 00:10.793
he'll exile me to the back pew

00:10.880 --> 00:13.230
with the smokers
and pregnant teens.

00:14.797 --> 00:16.407
My stomach's in knots.

00:16.494 --> 00:18.801
The last time I had to sit down
with Father Tim, I was 12

00:18.888 --> 00:20.803
and he told me
I'd spend eternity in hell.

00:22.457 --> 00:24.067
Well, that's what you get
for cuttin' cheese

00:24.154 --> 00:25.721
in the confessional booth.

00:27.592 --> 00:30.465
Turned the Lord's sacred place
of absolution into a Dutch oven.

00:32.423 --> 00:34.425
I'd like to believe over the
years, he'd forgotten about it

00:34.512 --> 00:36.862
but I've been
in a car with you.

00:36.949 --> 00:39.735
Just remember,
he's old school Catholic

00:39.822 --> 00:42.259
which means he's up at 6:00
and drunk by noon.

00:43.782 --> 00:45.480
And right now he's either
singing "Danny Boy"

00:45.567 --> 00:48.178
or taking a swing at a nun.

00:48.265 --> 00:50.702
Well, that's not
what Jesus would do.

00:50.789 --> 00:53.792
They didn't have nuns back then.

00:53.879 --> 00:56.360
And this is the guy we want
joining us in holy matrimony?

00:56.447 --> 00:59.276
Just make sure he knows
you're a good Catholic

00:59.363 --> 01:01.800
and the two of you
aren't living together in sin.

01:01.887 --> 01:03.802
But I'm not and we are.

01:05.587 --> 01:08.068
Please tell me she's not gonna
be herself in there.

01:09.547 --> 01:11.810
Look, if you get in a jam,
just bow your head

01:11.897 --> 01:13.812
and make the sign of the cross.

01:15.814 --> 01:17.773
Is it lefty-loosey
or righty-tighty?

01:17.860 --> 01:19.253
[door opens]

01:19.340 --> 01:20.428
Hey, there.
Are you Mike and Molly?

01:20.515 --> 01:21.472
- Yes.
- Yes, father.

01:21.559 --> 01:23.213
Hi. I'm Father Justin.

01:23.300 --> 01:25.302
Uh, Father Tim..

01:25.389 --> 01:26.521
Thank you.

01:28.436 --> 01:30.829
Father Tim is feeling a little
under the weather today.

01:30.916 --> 01:32.962
Overextend himself
doing the Lord's work

01:33.049 --> 01:35.095
or, uh, knock back
too much Jameson's

01:35.182 --> 01:37.271
at the monsignor's poker game?

01:37.358 --> 01:38.663
Actually, he's just trying
to throw a few more

01:38.750 --> 01:41.144
responsibilities my way.

01:41.231 --> 01:43.842
And, yes, the game did
go pretty late last night.

01:43.929 --> 01:45.670
Well, it doesn't matter
where the money comes from

01:45.757 --> 01:47.411
when the nun-mobile
needs new tires.

01:47.498 --> 01:48.673
Amen.

01:48.760 --> 01:49.979
Uh, so shall we get started?

01:50.066 --> 01:51.937
[sighs]
Let's do it.

01:53.678 --> 01:54.984
Oh, uh, actually

01:55.071 --> 01:56.290
this is just
for the couple-to-be.

01:56.377 --> 01:57.769
You'll need to wait out here.

01:57.856 --> 01:59.031
Hang on a second.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.382
Did Father Tim
tell you who I am?

02:01.469 --> 02:04.124
He did, and that's why I think
it increases their chances

02:04.211 --> 02:06.474
if they go this alone.

02:06.561 --> 02:09.172
I understand, father. I'm sure
you know what you're doing.

02:13.350 --> 02:15.744
I'll see you at
the church picnic, choirboy.

02:15.831 --> 02:19.313
I'll be the one in the potato
sack hoppin' right up your ass.

02:21.053 --> 02:26.276
♪ For the first time
in my life ♪

02:26.363 --> 02:30.802
♪ I see love ♪♪

02:39.420 --> 02:40.856
And strengthen their hearts

02:40.943 --> 02:42.858
so that they will keep faith
with each other

02:42.945 --> 02:46.035
please you in all things,
and so come to the happiness

02:46.122 --> 02:48.429
celebrating the sacrament
of their marriage.

02:48.516 --> 02:50.866
We ask this through Christ,
our Lord. Amen.

02:50.953 --> 02:52.824
- Amen.
- Yeah. Amen.

02:56.437 --> 02:59.396
Okay, the only requirement
here today is honesty.

02:59.483 --> 03:00.702
Uh, I'm gonna ask
a few questions

03:00.789 --> 03:02.617
about marriage and family

03:02.704 --> 03:05.750
and there are no wrong answers.
Just say what's in your heart.

03:05.837 --> 03:07.448
Are these gonna be
"churchy" kind of questions?

03:07.535 --> 03:09.885
'Cause I really haven't
been in a long time.

03:09.972 --> 03:11.582
She means to this church.

03:11.669 --> 03:14.716
We've been going to a different
parish closer to our house.

03:14.803 --> 03:16.457
Oh, I see.
So, you two are living together?

03:16.544 --> 03:18.415
No. Who told you that?

03:21.592 --> 03:23.507
Look, I-I understand
that many couples

03:23.594 --> 03:25.596
choose to live together
before getting married.

03:25.683 --> 03:27.903
It's really more of a financial
thing. Not about sex.

03:27.990 --> 03:30.906
I mean, I've held out
this long, right, honey?

03:30.993 --> 03:31.950
Sure.

03:34.431 --> 03:35.911
Guys, there's no need to pretend

03:35.998 --> 03:37.782
that you don't have
an intimate relationship.

03:37.869 --> 03:39.175
I-I may be a man of the cloth

03:39.262 --> 03:41.743
but I also have
Internet access and Cinemax.

03:43.658 --> 03:46.487
I'm sorry, father,
we're both just nervous

03:46.574 --> 03:49.316
and have no idea what it is
we're supposed to say.

03:49.403 --> 03:51.709
I'm just here to make sure
you two love each other

03:51.796 --> 03:53.885
and understand what it means
to enter into a marriage.

03:53.972 --> 03:55.583
Oh, yeah, she really
hammered home

03:55.670 --> 03:57.759
all that compromising
and listening crap.

03:58.586 --> 04:01.197
Stuff, father.

04:01.284 --> 04:02.242
Amen.

04:04.113 --> 04:05.767
I just need to confirm
a couple of things.

04:05.854 --> 04:07.638
Uh, your commitment
to the church

04:07.725 --> 04:09.727
and that you're planning on
raising your children Catholic.

04:09.814 --> 04:11.860
Can do and will do.
See you at the wedding, padre.

04:11.947 --> 04:13.601
Hang-hang on a second.

04:13.688 --> 04:16.386
We haven't really discussed
raising our kids Catholic.

04:16.473 --> 04:17.779
Molly, quit jokin' around.

04:17.866 --> 04:19.128
Of course we're going
to raise them Catholic.

04:19.215 --> 04:20.956
Church every Sunday,
and the rest of the week

04:21.043 --> 04:23.001
guilt, shame, penance and bingo.

04:23.088 --> 04:25.003
Mike, Mike, Mike..

04:25.090 --> 04:27.092
...he-he wants us to be honest.

04:27.179 --> 04:29.399
I mean, father,
we, we can promise you

04:29.486 --> 04:32.141
that we'll raise our children
with a strong set of values.

04:32.228 --> 04:33.185
Good to hear.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.709
But, come on

04:34.796 --> 04:36.014
we can't guarantee you what path

04:36.101 --> 04:37.189
they're gonna take
or that they're going to

04:37.277 --> 04:38.669
church every Sunday.

04:38.756 --> 04:39.931
Well, not every Sunday.

04:40.018 --> 04:41.933
I mean, if little Patrick
or Mary Teresa

04:42.020 --> 04:44.849
has the sniffles, we'll do like
a home worship kinda thing.

04:44.936 --> 04:46.808
And don't worry,
we'll make it long and boring

04:46.895 --> 04:48.766
just like a regular mass.

04:50.072 --> 04:51.682
So what I hear you saying

04:51.769 --> 04:53.945
is that you are not
a practicing Catholic

04:54.032 --> 04:56.339
and have no intention of raising
your children that way?

04:56.426 --> 04:58.123
No, I am a practicing Catholic.

04:58.210 --> 05:00.169
I just miss a lot of practices.

05:04.260 --> 05:07.394
Well, unfortunately, those are
two of the major requirements

05:07.481 --> 05:09.396
when getting married
in a Catholic church.

05:09.483 --> 05:12.486
Well, I don't think I should
force religion on my children.

05:12.573 --> 05:15.053
Don't we want that
to be their choice?

05:15.140 --> 05:16.228
Get a load of her.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.578
Kids makin' their own choices.

05:17.665 --> 05:20.363
What's next?
Dogs flying airplanes? Ha ha ha!

05:22.496 --> 05:24.933
I'm sorry, but we have
certain requirements.

05:25.020 --> 05:27.501
We have weddings here for our
parishioners, which you are not.

05:27.588 --> 05:28.763
We were willing
to make an exception

05:28.850 --> 05:30.634
because, frankly

05:30.721 --> 05:33.158
we're all pretty scared
of your mother.

05:33.245 --> 05:35.770
Speaking of which, uh,
mom said it'd be a good idea

05:35.857 --> 05:38.076
to, uh, grease God's wheel.

05:38.163 --> 05:39.991
And now a cop is bribing
a priest.

05:40.078 --> 05:42.777
- I think we're done here.
- Hang on a second.

05:42.864 --> 05:45.475
Are you not gonna marry us
because I can't guarantee you

05:45.562 --> 05:47.303
the souls of our
unborn children?

05:47.390 --> 05:49.218
Forgive her, father.
She's possessed.

05:49.305 --> 05:50.437
If you can spin
your head around

05:50.524 --> 05:52.569
now would be the time to do it.

05:53.875 --> 05:56.094
[instrumental music]

05:56.181 --> 05:58.706
How the hell did you
lose the church?

05:58.793 --> 06:01.012
Did you take a whore bath
in the holy water?

06:01.099 --> 06:02.927
He told us to be honest!

06:03.014 --> 06:05.495
[sighs]
Do you know how many acts
of Christian charity

06:05.582 --> 06:07.149
I'm gonna have to do
to work my way

06:07.236 --> 06:08.585
back to the front
of the sanctuary?

06:08.672 --> 06:10.239
This is not my fault!

06:10.326 --> 06:12.720
Well, it's your name
I'll be cursing every Saturday

06:12.807 --> 06:15.984
while I'm spooning out Beefaroni
to a pack of smelly hobos!

06:16.071 --> 06:18.552
What was I supposed to do? Just
sit there and lie to a priest?

06:18.639 --> 06:22.556
That's exactlywhat you do.

06:22.643 --> 06:26.124
You say you covet your
neighbor's new leaf blower

06:26.211 --> 06:28.431
not that you want to clean
his colon with it!

06:29.867 --> 06:32.087
Every good Catholic knows that.

06:33.871 --> 06:36.352
[instrumental music]

06:38.136 --> 06:39.964
I can't believe this,
one month before the wedding

06:40.051 --> 06:41.575
and we lose the church.

06:41.662 --> 06:43.664
And there's no other
places available?

06:43.751 --> 06:46.014
Oh, the senior center said
we can get married there.

06:46.101 --> 06:47.319
Good news,
they have a dance floor.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.887
Bad news,
lots of people have died on it.

06:52.063 --> 06:53.978
I got a buddy who'd let you
use his warehouse.

06:54.065 --> 06:55.763
Beautiful space

06:55.850 --> 06:58.330
if you can tolerate
near-freezing temperatures

06:58.418 --> 07:00.420
and a few pig carcasses.

07:02.204 --> 07:03.858
Oh, good, that covers
old and rotting.

07:03.945 --> 07:07.296
Now I just need something
borrowed and blue.

07:07.383 --> 07:10.386
Don't get mad at me just 'cause
you got lippy with a priest.

07:10.473 --> 07:12.867
Yeah, sweetie, you got to be
careful with that bunch.

07:12.954 --> 07:14.390
They can't have sex with women

07:14.477 --> 07:16.697
so they got to find another way
to stick it to you.

07:18.394 --> 07:19.787
I didn't do anything wrong.

07:19.874 --> 07:22.050
"Thou shalt not tell a lie."
And I didn't.

07:22.137 --> 07:24.444
No, I think you're thinking
of George Washington, honey.

07:26.141 --> 07:29.274
The Bible's chockfull of
little fibs and out-and-out BS.

07:31.189 --> 07:33.148
Yeah, I mean a guy gets
swallowed by a whale

07:33.235 --> 07:34.541
and lives to tell about it?

07:34.628 --> 07:36.804
I don't think so.

07:36.891 --> 07:39.850
Vin, you're confusing the Bible
with Pinocchio again.

07:43.027 --> 07:45.377
Which one had
the talking cricket?

07:47.554 --> 07:49.381
I'm going out for a beer.
I'll be back in a while.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.079
What are you talking about?

07:51.166 --> 07:53.037
You need to help me find us
a place to get married.

07:53.124 --> 07:54.517
Hey, how about the church
I grew up in?

07:54.604 --> 07:56.693
Oh, wait, you kinda blew that
for us, didn't you?

07:56.780 --> 07:58.129
Mike, what happened happened.

07:58.216 --> 07:59.174
It didn't have to happen

07:59.261 --> 08:00.567
if you'd just followed my lead.

08:00.654 --> 08:02.046
Maybe if you talked
a little less and listened

08:02.133 --> 08:04.048
a little more,
we wouldn't be in this mess.

08:05.397 --> 08:06.660
- Really?
- Okay.

08:06.747 --> 08:09.445
- Nighty-night, kids.
- Sleep tight.

08:09.532 --> 08:10.968
Look, I don't want
to have a big fight.

08:11.055 --> 08:13.928
Oh, it is too late for that.

08:14.015 --> 08:15.277
So you're saying you want me

08:15.364 --> 08:16.713
to just smile
and keep my trap shut?

08:16.800 --> 08:18.193
That's not what I said.

08:18.280 --> 08:19.716
But that's what
you're thinking, isn't it?

08:19.803 --> 08:21.326
Yes, but I have the good sense
not to say it.

08:21.413 --> 08:23.415
You see how easy it is!

08:26.288 --> 08:27.681
Molly and I had a fight.

08:27.768 --> 08:30.161
Well, this is your home
and you're always welcome.

08:30.248 --> 08:31.423
You have to sleep
on the couch, though.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.425
I gave your old room to Jim.

08:34.339 --> 08:36.733
[instrumental music]

08:40.215 --> 08:41.521
[instrumental music]

08:43.044 --> 08:44.828
I'll have a Denver omelet
with buttered toast

08:44.915 --> 08:46.003
and a glass of OJ.

08:46.090 --> 08:48.005
Water and Alka-Seltzer for me.

08:48.092 --> 08:50.181
Oh, a nasty food hangover, huh?

08:50.268 --> 08:53.184
May I recommend a little hair
of the 12 hot dogs that bit you?

08:55.099 --> 08:58.015
For your information, I did not
have one single hot dog.

08:58.102 --> 09:00.496
He had two tubes of cookie
dough, one cooked and one not

09:00.583 --> 09:02.759
and two chicken pot pies..

09:02.846 --> 09:05.806
...also one cooked and one not.

09:05.893 --> 09:07.590
Why do I even tell you
this stuff?

09:07.677 --> 09:09.810
You didn't. I guessed it
by the smell of your burps.

09:11.725 --> 09:15.424
FYI, the walk-in freezer has
a padlock and a security camera.

09:15.511 --> 09:17.208
Don't embarrass yourself.

09:18.732 --> 09:20.690
So, you're telling me
the wedding is off now?

09:20.777 --> 09:22.823
No, we just have to find
a new place to have it.

09:22.910 --> 09:25.390
And there's a 50-50 chance
that I won't even be invited.

09:27.262 --> 09:30.265
Well, I'm just asking 'cause you
know how tight my schedule is.

09:30.352 --> 09:33.921
That's the first thing I thought
of when my life fell apart.

09:34.008 --> 09:37.185
"Will Carl have to reschedule
his fantasy baseball draft?"

09:37.272 --> 09:40.667
No, you can't reschedule
the draft. That's my point.

09:40.754 --> 09:43.060
I didn't even want a big
church wedding, but she did

09:43.147 --> 09:44.888
so I went along with it,
'cause I'm a get-along guy.

09:44.975 --> 09:46.455
Like most men are,
you know why you never hear

09:46.542 --> 09:47.761
the phrase "get-along girl?"

09:47.848 --> 09:50.590
'Cause there's never been one.

09:50.677 --> 09:52.374
They have to let everybody know
what they're thinking.

09:52.461 --> 09:54.768
They get a bad haircut,
the whole world has to know.

09:54.855 --> 09:57.509
Me, I just let you make fun
of me till it grows out.

09:59.599 --> 10:00.643
Nah, I know what you mean.

10:00.730 --> 10:01.949
Christina's also very vocal.

10:02.036 --> 10:03.646
The other day she had
to call out some guy

10:03.733 --> 10:04.952
in the nine-items-or-less aisle.

10:05.039 --> 10:06.606
Why can't they just let that go?

10:06.693 --> 10:08.564
Especially when the offending
shopper is a big biker

10:08.651 --> 10:10.958
with crazy eyes
and 14 boxes of Sudafed.

10:14.439 --> 10:17.094
You know what Molly does? She
shushes people at the movies.

10:17.181 --> 10:18.879
- Oh, no, she's one of those?
- Yeah.

10:18.966 --> 10:20.663
The other night
there was this young couple

10:20.750 --> 10:23.057
in front of us and the woman was
yammering on about something.

10:23.144 --> 10:26.234
Just tell me this,
were they black?

10:26.321 --> 10:28.062
Well, that's not the point
of the story, Carl.

10:28.149 --> 10:29.585
But, yes, of course
they were black.

10:29.672 --> 10:31.413
Damn.

10:31.500 --> 10:32.762
I try to lead by example

10:32.849 --> 10:34.721
but my people
simply will not follow.

10:37.506 --> 10:40.640
Anyway, Molly starts in with the
shushing but they ignored it.

10:40.727 --> 10:42.554
Yeah, then she leans
in with a "Do you mind?"

10:42.642 --> 10:45.688
Which translates to "Hey,
wanna punch my fat boyfriend?"

10:45.775 --> 10:48.386
Mmm, so, how did it end?

10:48.473 --> 10:51.694
I had a grape soda tossed at my
face by woman named Shaniqua.

10:54.784 --> 10:56.351
Still better than having
a meth-head biker

10:56.438 --> 10:59.223
make fun of your tiny ears
and your hemorrhoid cream.

10:59.310 --> 11:01.922
By the way, if Christina ever
asks, you have hemorrhoids.

11:03.532 --> 11:05.273
[instrumental music]

11:05.360 --> 11:06.535
- Did Mike call?
- No.

11:06.622 --> 11:08.668
- Oh.
- But my pot dealer did.

11:08.755 --> 11:10.539
He said if you want to,
you can have your wedding

11:10.626 --> 11:13.194
in his basement grow room.

11:13.281 --> 11:15.849
Well, at least
the lighting will be good.

11:15.936 --> 11:17.198
Put a pin in that
on the off chance

11:17.285 --> 11:18.895
that we do actually get married.

11:18.982 --> 11:21.637
Oh, come on, Moll, this is just
pre-wedding jitters.

11:21.724 --> 11:23.073
You and Mike love each other.

11:23.160 --> 11:24.379
You're gonna work it out.

11:24.466 --> 11:25.554
Hey, I'm not gonna apologize

11:25.641 --> 11:26.903
for being an opinionated person.

11:26.990 --> 11:28.731
It's who I am
and it's not gonna change.

11:28.818 --> 11:29.906
- Certainly hasn't so far.
- Hey!

11:29.993 --> 11:32.474
And that's good.

11:32.561 --> 11:33.954
Yeah, damn right it's good.

11:34.041 --> 11:36.217
I deserve a man
who appreciates me for who I am

11:36.304 --> 11:38.306
straight-shootin' Molly Flynn.

11:38.393 --> 11:40.612
- Sassy, brassy, kiss my ass-y.
- Exactly.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.963
If he wants some little
quiet wallflower

11:43.050 --> 11:44.616
to cook him dinner
and laugh at his jokes

11:44.704 --> 11:46.227
he can go look
somewhere else for that.

11:46.314 --> 11:48.272
- Can't put Baby in a corner.
- No, you cannot.

11:48.359 --> 11:51.188
And if you try to do it,
Baby's gonna bite.

11:51.275 --> 11:52.973
So what are you gonna do,
call off the wedding?

11:53.060 --> 11:54.714
No, you're gonna call
your pot dealer, I'm gonna call

11:54.801 --> 11:56.063
the bakery and have them
turn a wedding cake

11:56.150 --> 11:58.413
into a thousand cupcakes.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.937
[instrumental music]

12:01.024 --> 12:04.593
Listen, he's my son and he's
only gonna be here a few days.

12:04.680 --> 12:05.768
You're still my favorite

12:05.855 --> 12:07.901
so quit crapping
on the bath mat.

12:10.033 --> 12:11.600
Don't pretend it wasn't you.

12:11.687 --> 12:14.255
I'm old, but I can still
clutch my mud.

12:18.302 --> 12:19.260
Hey, mom.

12:19.347 --> 12:21.523
What did I just say?

12:21.610 --> 12:23.003
How was your day, boy?

12:23.090 --> 12:24.874
- Fine. Did Molly call?
- No, she didn't.

12:24.961 --> 12:26.310
And you're not gonna call her

12:26.397 --> 12:28.486
'cause you got nothing
to apologize for.

12:28.573 --> 12:30.662
I don't know. I might have
overreacted a little.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.187
Hey, nothing wrong with
standing up for yourself.

12:33.274 --> 12:34.841
You don't want
to walk into a marriage

12:34.928 --> 12:37.017
crawling around on all fours.

12:37.104 --> 12:39.454
Are we gonna go
nose-to-nose all night?

12:41.499 --> 12:43.937
- Something smells good.
- Made your favorite.

12:44.024 --> 12:45.895
Tuna noodle casserole
with two cans

12:45.982 --> 12:47.418
of Pringles crumbled on top.

12:47.505 --> 12:49.420
One regular, one cool ranch.

12:49.507 --> 12:51.422
And you cooked it so the noodles
got a little crunchy?

12:51.509 --> 12:53.033
'Just the way you like it.'

12:53.120 --> 12:55.731
I also made a batch of chocolate
peanut butter brownies.

12:55.818 --> 12:57.646
We'll put on the feed bag
and watch that show

12:57.733 --> 12:59.648
about the two girls and a horse.

13:00.692 --> 13:02.216
Sounds good.

13:02.303 --> 13:03.347
What are you doing?

13:03.434 --> 13:05.175
Just checking my phone messages.

13:05.262 --> 13:08.744
Boy, she's really got you
by the skin pickle, doesn't she?

13:11.355 --> 13:13.140
Know what, mom?
You need to back off.

13:13.227 --> 13:15.707
All I'm saying is, if you're
really gonna marry this woman

13:15.795 --> 13:17.448
she needs to know who's boss.

13:17.535 --> 13:19.407
I don't want to be her boss.
I want to be her husband.

13:19.494 --> 13:22.018
What you're acting like
is her damn lapdog.

13:22.105 --> 13:23.759
Not everything is about you.

13:25.152 --> 13:26.806
- Can we just eat?
- I don't know.

13:26.893 --> 13:29.765
Why don't you call your fiance
and ask her if you're hungry?

13:29.852 --> 13:32.159
Alright, Mom, you are
treading on very thin ice.

13:32.246 --> 13:34.901
I didn't raise you to spend
your life getting browbeaten

13:34.988 --> 13:37.381
by some loudmouth harpy.

13:37.468 --> 13:38.948
At some point,
you're gonna have to

13:39.035 --> 13:40.950
grow a pair
and say "Enough is enough."

13:41.037 --> 13:43.387
You know what, mom?
You're right. Enough is enough!

13:43.474 --> 13:46.173
I'm sick of you butting into my
life and bad-mouthing my love!

13:46.260 --> 13:49.219
And if you keep it up, you and I
are gonna have a real problem!

13:55.399 --> 13:58.011
You can't get along
with anybody, can you?

13:58.098 --> 14:00.187
Don't start with me, Carl.
I'm not in the mood.

14:00.274 --> 14:01.797
You better be nice to me.

14:01.884 --> 14:04.104
Because you're running out
of houses.

14:04.191 --> 14:07.237
[instrumental music]

14:07.324 --> 14:09.370
Mmm. I will say this
about your mom.

14:09.457 --> 14:10.762
For an old, crusty woman

14:10.850 --> 14:13.417
she sure makes a moist,
chewy brownie.

14:13.504 --> 14:14.854
You think
I chose her house first

14:14.941 --> 14:17.769
'cause she's so fun
to be around?

14:17.857 --> 14:19.728
Look, man, you're welcome
to stay here, but eventually

14:19.815 --> 14:21.338
you and Molly are gonna have
to talk this thing out.

14:21.425 --> 14:22.383
Yeah, I know.

14:22.470 --> 14:23.993
See, communication is the glue

14:24.080 --> 14:25.821
that holds
a relationship together.

14:25.908 --> 14:27.170
That and staying out
of the bathroom

14:27.257 --> 14:29.303
when she shaves her legs
or makes a boom-boom.

14:31.783 --> 14:33.524
Michael, please tell me
you're not trusting

14:33.611 --> 14:35.875
the delicate machinations
of your relationship

14:35.962 --> 14:37.964
to this talking donkey.

14:39.748 --> 14:41.054
Excuse me.

14:41.141 --> 14:42.446
I am in a committed
relationship now

14:42.533 --> 14:43.839
and think I have
some valuable insight

14:43.926 --> 14:45.275
into the male-female dynamic.

14:45.362 --> 14:46.450
Boy, just 'cause you got a ride

14:46.537 --> 14:47.756
on the lucky bus don't mean

14:47.843 --> 14:48.975
you should be teaching
other people

14:49.062 --> 14:50.585
how to drive.

14:52.500 --> 14:53.980
I'm gonna get some milk.

14:54.067 --> 14:55.851
Well, use a glass this time.

14:55.938 --> 14:58.419
'Cause if I hear that milk jug
crinkle from you sucking on it

14:58.506 --> 15:01.291
I'm going Buster Douglas
on the side of your head.

15:06.253 --> 15:07.994
Thanks for letting me
stay here tonight, nana.

15:08.081 --> 15:10.257
Oh, you're welcome
here anytime, Michael.

15:10.344 --> 15:12.694
But I hate to think of that
pretty little girl of yours

15:12.781 --> 15:14.522
fretting and worrying about you.

15:14.609 --> 15:17.264
I don't wanna hurt her. I'm just
afraid that we're too different.

15:17.351 --> 15:18.961
Well, different is good.

15:19.048 --> 15:20.745
Yeah, but she's got to have
an opinion about everything.

15:20.832 --> 15:23.183
If she sees something wrong, she
gotta say something about it.

15:23.270 --> 15:25.011
And what would you
prefer her to do?

15:25.098 --> 15:28.144
Sit back, smile, and pretend
like everything's okay?

15:28.231 --> 15:29.798
That's what I do.

15:29.885 --> 15:32.366
And that's what you were
doing before you met her.

15:32.453 --> 15:34.629
Sitting in that sad
little apartment

15:34.716 --> 15:38.111
50 pounds heavier,
pretending everything was okay.

15:39.286 --> 15:40.809
God, I was a mess.

15:40.896 --> 15:42.332
And if that woman
had just shut up

15:42.419 --> 15:44.030
and left well enough alone

15:44.117 --> 15:45.945
you'd still be a mess.

15:46.032 --> 15:47.990
Standing in your kitchen

15:48.077 --> 15:52.125
drinking milk right out of
the jug like I told you not to!

15:59.132 --> 16:01.221
Damn, old woman,
you got ears like a bat.

16:06.574 --> 16:07.575
Mm.

16:09.142 --> 16:11.231
You've got a good,
strong woman there.

16:11.318 --> 16:14.408
And you don't love her
in spite of what she is.

16:14.495 --> 16:17.237
You love her because
of what she is.

16:18.890 --> 16:21.850
[chuckles]

16:21.937 --> 16:23.983
I better get home
and help Molly find a place

16:24.070 --> 16:25.810
for us to have our wedding.

16:25.897 --> 16:28.248
Well, if you need a church,
the First Baptist

16:28.335 --> 16:30.946
is always happy to open
its doors to a young couple.

16:31.033 --> 16:31.991
Really?

16:32.078 --> 16:33.209
As long as your check clears

16:33.296 --> 16:34.254
and you keep your drinking

16:34.341 --> 16:35.820
to the parking lot.

16:37.387 --> 16:39.911
No problem.
Molly's mom can drink anywhere.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.826
[laughing]

16:43.132 --> 16:44.873
That was really nice
of you, grandma.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.744
Well, him I can fix.

16:46.831 --> 16:50.226
You're like a bad rash
that always needs gas money.

16:52.837 --> 16:54.752
We're out of milk.

16:56.885 --> 16:59.714
Just make me so mad,
I could just..

16:59.801 --> 17:01.803
[instrumental music]

17:05.198 --> 17:06.677
[instrumental music]

17:07.983 --> 17:09.767
Sweetie, I-I want
to apologize again

17:09.854 --> 17:11.334
for the way I spoke to you.

17:11.421 --> 17:12.857
I'm sorry for telling you
not to let the door

17:12.944 --> 17:14.598
hit you in the butt
on the way out.

17:14.685 --> 17:15.904
You actually said "ass."

17:15.991 --> 17:18.211
Do we want to replay
the game tapes?

17:19.690 --> 17:21.257
No, ma'am, we do not.

17:21.344 --> 17:23.259
But don't worry,
I promise, this time

17:23.346 --> 17:25.435
I'll let you do
most of the talking.

17:25.522 --> 17:29.091
Hey, your honest, assertive
nature is what I love about you

17:29.178 --> 17:31.006
and what makes us a great team.

17:31.093 --> 17:32.442
Thanks, sweetie.

17:33.748 --> 17:35.097
But just to be on the safe side

17:35.184 --> 17:36.925
I should probably
take the lead on this.

17:37.795 --> 17:39.493
Good morning. Morning.

17:39.580 --> 17:41.277
Morning.

17:41.364 --> 17:43.671
So, Sister Rosetta tells me

17:43.758 --> 17:47.283
that you two would like to
get married in our sanctuary.

17:47.370 --> 17:49.285
Are either one of you Baptist?

17:49.372 --> 17:50.721
Uh..

17:50.808 --> 17:52.158
We're not.

17:52.245 --> 17:53.550
But if it's a deal-breaker

17:53.637 --> 17:55.813
take me to the river
and dunk me in the water.

17:57.032 --> 17:58.860
Well, that won't be necessary.

17:58.947 --> 18:01.602
The only requirement here
is you have faith in God.

18:01.689 --> 18:04.213
And a $1,200 check
made out to cash.

18:06.172 --> 18:09.523
So we don't have to
pretend to be Baptist or..

18:09.610 --> 18:12.134
...black or..

18:12.221 --> 18:15.398
Well, you can if you want.
It's your wedding.

18:15.485 --> 18:19.054
And if you are gonna pretend to
be black, you'll want our choir.

18:19.141 --> 18:21.796
And that's an extra $400.

18:21.883 --> 18:24.015
- Amen, brother.
- Hallelujah.

18:26.017 --> 18:27.845
You know, I-I had
a great-great grandmother

18:27.932 --> 18:29.978
that was half-black,
half-Cherokee.

18:30.065 --> 18:31.110
Really?

18:32.937 --> 18:34.504
No. I don't know why
I just said that.

18:34.591 --> 18:36.419
I should just shut up.

18:37.986 --> 18:40.293
[instrumental music]

18:45.559 --> 18:47.952
[theme music]
