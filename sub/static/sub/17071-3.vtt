we missed out on the good candy,
and that party sucked.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.829
Brian cried,
Trent lost his chair,

19:22.862 --> 19:23.863
Walt just spilled something
on his mom's dress --

19:23.896 --> 19:25.498
he's grounded.

19:25.532 --> 19:28.034
Some bullies thought I was
dressed like Basketball Simba.

19:28.067 --> 19:29.736
They lifted me up
by my waist

19:29.769 --> 19:32.004
and carried me around
like this...

19:32.038 --> 19:33.873
Do you know
how demeaning that is?!

19:33.906 --> 19:37.176
Is Dave gonna be okay?

19:37.210 --> 19:38.645
He's fine.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.313
I'm just gonna let him sweat
for a little bit.

19:40.347 --> 19:42.849
Seriously,
are we cool, man?!

19:42.882 --> 19:45.218
Can we just agree, overall, that
I've been a good friend to you?

19:53.092 --> 19:54.561
What if you don't like it?

19:54.594 --> 19:56.263
Oh, come on.
We want to hear it.

19:56.296 --> 19:57.330
Yeah.
Yeah, it'll be good.

19:57.364 --> 19:59.266
Let's go! Whoo!

19:59.299 --> 20:01.067
Okay, I'll read
the first chapter.

20:02.569 --> 20:04.371
It's 60 pages long,
but I don't see any cuts.

20:04.404 --> 20:07.173
[ Sighs ]

20:07.206 --> 20:10.777
"'A Case of a Knife
to the Brain' by A.L. Tyson."

20:10.810 --> 20:12.679
That's my pen name so we don't
get crazies at the door.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.213
Smart.

20:14.247 --> 20:16.916
"It was just another body
on just another Tuesday.

20:16.949 --> 20:19.352
The sun cast an auburn glow
on the dewy grass

20:19.386 --> 20:21.187
beneath
the marbled-purple corpse.

20:21.220 --> 20:24.624
Three feet away, a sensibly
priced, blood-red pump

20:24.657 --> 20:27.760
extinguishes a Virginia Slim
with a vigorous twist.

20:27.794 --> 20:31.230
'[ Sighs ]
God, I hate Detroit.'

20:31.264 --> 20:34.801
This is Jennifer Hong,
smart as she is beautiful.

20:34.834 --> 20:37.069
She pushes through
the plastic police line,

20:37.103 --> 20:38.605
never one for red tape,

20:38.638 --> 20:40.740
which, in this instance,
is yellow.

20:40.773 --> 20:43.410
'Hey, Freckles,'
she barks a lazy beat cop.

20:43.443 --> 20:45.077
'I'm gonna need a step stool.'

20:45.111 --> 20:46.779
'Why?' asks Chief Stephens,

20:46.813 --> 20:49.416
his incuriosity born
from a looming pension,

20:49.449 --> 20:52.218
soft upbringing,
and overall whiteness.

20:52.251 --> 20:55.221
'To get the murder weapon,
dummy,' she yawns,

20:55.254 --> 20:58.991
pointing to a 9-inch Bowie knife
stuck in a knobby oak tree.

20:59.025 --> 21:01.661
'I'll be damned,'
Stephens chortles.

21:01.694 --> 21:04.063
She pops an orange Tic Tac
in her mouth

21:04.096 --> 21:05.632
and brushes past Amber,

21:05.665 --> 21:08.167
a brunette
with electric green eyes

21:08.200 --> 21:11.003
dusting the rotting cadaver
for prints.

21:11.037 --> 21:13.139
Remember her.

21:13.172 --> 21:14.974
'Hey, Hong,' yells Stephens.

21:15.007 --> 21:16.843
'We got reports to fill out.'

21:16.876 --> 21:19.312
Jennifer spins back,
'I got three kids,

21:19.346 --> 21:22.315
a judgmental mother-in-law,
and an emotional husband

21:22.349 --> 21:24.451
who likes to play games
with the oven!

21:24.484 --> 21:28.855
I don't have time for reports.'"
