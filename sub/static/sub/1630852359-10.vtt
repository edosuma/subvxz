- State your business
with the fort.

02:29.683 --> 02:30.884
- You're boys.

02:30.951 --> 02:32.286
- State your business.

02:34.121 --> 02:36.089
- Who are you gonna protect?

02:37.425 --> 02:39.627
- I guess I'll protect
who needs protecting.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.864
- You should spend some time
outside these walls

02:43.931 --> 02:45.666
before you make that statement.

02:48.602 --> 02:51.305
- State your business
or be on your way.

03:01.949 --> 03:03.150
- Don't touch her!

03:04.885 --> 03:07.788
- What's wrong with her?
We don't need no smallpox.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.390
- She got shot.

03:09.457 --> 03:10.658
Get the surgeon.

03:12.926 --> 03:13.761
- Follow me.

03:15.028 --> 03:15.996
- Come on, baby.

04:28.135 --> 04:30.404
- Major, a woman needs help.

04:37.345 --> 04:39.313
- What happened?
- She was shot.

04:41.181 --> 04:43.451
- Gonna need to summon
yer staff, Major.

04:43.517 --> 04:47.220
Got two more coming behind--
head wound and a snake bite.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.790
- Well, just list
the ailments, sir.

04:49.857 --> 04:51.191
I'll decide who to summon.

04:55.062 --> 04:56.196
Looks like she's already
been treated.

04:56.263 --> 04:58.031
- Just a battle dressing.

04:58.098 --> 05:00.434
- Is there a battle
that I'm not I'm unaware of?

05:00.501 --> 05:02.370
Gunfights do not a battle make.

05:02.436 --> 05:04.204
- Captain.

05:04.271 --> 05:07.608
Gunfights do not
a battle make, "Captain."

05:07.675 --> 05:10.711
Believe me when I say,
I know the difference, Major.

05:15.583 --> 05:17.885
- This wound is from an arrow.
- Mm-hm.

05:20.888 --> 05:24.358
Swelling in her liver.

05:25.593 --> 05:27.127
I suggest you get her
to Fort Laramie.

05:27.194 --> 05:28.496
Nothing I can do for you here.

05:28.562 --> 05:31.765
I got no porters,
no nurses, no staff at all.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.067
- How can you man a fort
without a staff?

05:34.134 --> 05:36.537
- There is no fort.

05:36.604 --> 05:38.338
It's been abandoned.

05:38.406 --> 05:41.509
We're meeting engineers
from Pacific Northwest

05:41.575 --> 05:46.179
as they map a path
for the railroad north and east.

05:46.246 --> 05:48.749
No more wagons
for this country.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.918
Who is she to you?
- She's my daughter.

05:53.621 --> 05:55.423
- The arrow hit her liver.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.891
Hard enough to recover
from a bullet through the liver,

05:57.958 --> 05:59.292
let alone an arrow.

05:59.359 --> 06:02.062
Those things are filthy
and half the time poisoned.

06:02.129 --> 06:05.365
And even if her liver does heal,
sepsis is in her.

06:05.433 --> 06:10.337
I'm not saying it can't be beat,
but I've never seen it.

06:10.404 --> 06:13.507
- Just get her strong enough
to travel, that's all I ask.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.509
- Travel?
She's done traveling.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.911
Laramie is as far as she goes.
If you're lucky.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.680
Best you can hope for
is that she wakes

06:19.747 --> 06:21.615
and you get to say goodbye.

06:21.682 --> 06:22.783
I'll get my bag.

06:46.640 --> 06:47.775
- Move!

06:56.083 --> 07:00.087
- You ain't no soldiers
but you're manning a fort.

07:00.153 --> 07:02.322
- We're with the CY Ranch.

07:02.389 --> 07:04.424
The ranch owns the fort.

07:04.492 --> 07:08.762
- CY part of the Wyoming
Stock Grower's Association?

07:08.829 --> 07:12.866
- Part of it.
Mr. Carey founded it.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.034
- Don't that figure.

07:14.101 --> 07:17.137
- Y'all need rooms
for the night?

07:17.204 --> 07:18.038
We rent 'em.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.372
- We're gonna keep moving.

07:28.415 --> 07:29.583
- Where'd they go?

07:43.564 --> 07:44.698
- We head to Laramie.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.834
- All this land is owned
by the boss

07:46.900 --> 07:48.669
of those deputies we killed.

07:50.604 --> 07:51.839
This fort included.

07:51.905 --> 07:54.141
- Go north.
Hit the Bozeman trail.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.910
- That'll put us in Montana
for the winter.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.479
You think this place is wild.

07:59.547 --> 08:03.584
- Ain't gonna take them long
for those deputies we killed.

08:03.651 --> 08:05.553
This whole country
will be hunting us.

08:05.619 --> 08:06.554
Again.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.589
- Your daughter needs a doctor.

08:11.792 --> 08:15.563
- What's a doctor
gonna do for her?

08:15.629 --> 08:17.330
You been to war.
I have too.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.735
Three days.

08:21.802 --> 08:24.538
Her liver either heals
or it fails.

08:24.605 --> 08:28.375
And if it heals,
she's got another week maybe.

08:30.443 --> 08:31.612
- Yeah.

08:34.281 --> 08:35.849
- I gotta talk to my wife.

08:51.298 --> 08:52.465
Walk with me?

08:55.102 --> 08:56.570
- John, go check
on your sister, okay?

09:00.674 --> 09:04.077
- We can't wait it out here.

09:04.144 --> 09:05.679
- Why not?

09:05.746 --> 09:07.715
- Doesn't matter why.
We just can't.

09:07.781 --> 09:10.450
Ain't no doctor can help her.

09:10.517 --> 09:12.019
Nobody can.

09:16.690 --> 09:19.860
And we ain't gonna lay her
to rest here.

09:19.927 --> 09:22.596
We keep heading north.

09:22.663 --> 09:26.800
Where she dies,
that's where we stay.

09:26.867 --> 09:27.935
She'll be with us.

09:30.037 --> 09:32.539
And you can visit her
any time you want.

09:32.606 --> 09:34.041
- Oh, I'll be there every day.

09:36.610 --> 09:38.646
Until you put me in the ground
right beside her.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.068
- I need everyone
to gather around.

10:10.711 --> 10:12.713
We're gonna head north
from here.

10:12.780 --> 10:15.248
Winter in the Bozeman valley,

10:15.315 --> 10:17.918
then push on to Oregon
in the spring.

10:19.820 --> 10:22.022
- No no no.
We go to Oregon now.

10:22.089 --> 10:23.523
- In the springtime.

10:23.590 --> 10:25.092
- You promised.

10:25.158 --> 10:27.527
- I'm keeping my promise...

10:27.594 --> 10:29.863
I just changed the way
I'm keeping it.

10:29.930 --> 10:32.232
Get ready to leave.

10:35.903 --> 10:39.873
- Captain, these folks
need a few days.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.875
Gotta get Josef to the doctor.

10:41.942 --> 10:45.045
- There is no doctor.
Just more of those thieves.

10:45.112 --> 10:47.781
And if we stay around here,
they're gonna hang us.

10:47.848 --> 10:49.649
- We are staying.

10:49.717 --> 10:52.753
The trail is easy enough
to follow now.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.722
We will make it to Oregon
without you.

10:54.788 --> 10:55.789
- Suit yourself.

11:11.338 --> 11:15.042
- Wait. Wait...
We go with you.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.145
- Show me your leg.

11:21.214 --> 11:22.349
Show me your leg.

11:30.223 --> 11:32.459
You can't drive.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.061
You can't walk.

11:34.127 --> 11:35.362
She can't drive.

11:36.596 --> 11:38.465
How am I supposed
to take you with me?

11:38.531 --> 11:39.499
- I'll drive it.

11:43.236 --> 11:47.307
- They're gonna die.
- Then they die.

11:47.374 --> 11:51.011
They're free people now.
That's what they chose.

11:54.114 --> 11:56.249
- Ain't my job to tell you
what to drive.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.460
- We got a herd of cattle just
sitting in the prairie.

12:09.596 --> 12:10.563
- Leave 'em.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.400
- What do you want us to do?

12:13.466 --> 12:14.634
- What do you want to do?

12:15.769 --> 12:17.470
- I hate turning my back
to ya, but...

12:17.537 --> 12:20.273
If we ain't pushing cattle
for you, we ain't much use.

12:43.396 --> 12:44.497
- Where are we goin'?

12:44.564 --> 12:46.900
- Montana, honey.

12:49.169 --> 12:51.404
- Wonder what that'll be like.

12:58.912 --> 13:01.348
- It was a hell of a thing
riding with you.

13:01.414 --> 13:04.017
- It was a hell
of a thing riding with you.

13:04.084 --> 13:07.587
Wasn't a day on this
drive I was prettier than you.

13:07.654 --> 13:09.689
You'll always the be one that
got away, Elsa.

13:09.756 --> 13:12.559
- Colton, you gotta be pretty
damn good looking

13:12.625 --> 13:15.062
to think the one you never
had got away from you.

13:17.697 --> 13:20.033
Go back to Texas,
you pretty son of a bitch.

13:21.969 --> 13:22.970
- Ma'am.

13:34.181 --> 13:36.049
- <i>I wondered
what became of them.</i>

13:36.116 --> 13:38.018
<i>Wondered if they staked their
claim in Wyoming</i>

13:38.085 --> 13:40.120
<i>and built sod houses,</i>

13:40.187 --> 13:44.324
<i>bought cattle and tried to
scratch a life from this place.</i>

13:44.391 --> 13:46.894
<i>Or perhaps they fought
the winter and braved their way</i>

13:46.960 --> 13:49.963
<i>to Oregon, laying stakes
in the emerald fields</i>

13:50.030 --> 13:53.133
<i>of the Willamette Valley.</i>

13:53.200 --> 13:56.403
<i>But I'd seen too much
of this world...</i>

13:56.469 --> 13:59.606
<i>knew too much
about the nature of man</i>

13:59.672 --> 14:03.310
<i>to think either would be
their future.</i>

14:03.376 --> 14:06.779
<i>Another future awaited them,
and it lay in the abyss</i>

14:06.846 --> 14:10.550
<i>of unmarked graves
along the Oregon Trail.</i>

15:12.145 --> 15:13.513
- She any better today?

15:15.248 --> 15:16.683
- She won't take water.

15:18.651 --> 15:19.719
- Mm.

15:22.855 --> 15:24.924
- Your leg is dying.

15:24.992 --> 15:27.460
And the death is working
its way up.

15:29.496 --> 15:32.632
Now, we can take the leg...

15:32.699 --> 15:34.034
or you can die with it.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.570
Those are your choices.

15:39.872 --> 15:41.208
- You know this?

15:43.143 --> 15:44.411
- I know it.

15:45.979 --> 15:47.114
- You know how to take the leg?

15:48.781 --> 15:49.882
- I know how.

15:54.554 --> 15:55.488
- Take it.

15:57.890 --> 15:58.858
- Okay.

16:06.566 --> 16:10.137
♪ Lullaby and goodnight... ♪

16:10.203 --> 16:12.772
- Margaret's been holding
out on us.

16:12.839 --> 16:14.674
- She only sings for the kids.

16:16.343 --> 16:17.544
- Not for you?

16:19.412 --> 16:22.549
- She promised me she'd sing
at my funeral,

16:22.615 --> 16:26.053
but she made me promise
she'd die first, so...

16:26.119 --> 16:28.755
Got horse traded out of my song.

16:30.923 --> 16:33.626
- Women will strike some tricky
bargains, won't they.

16:33.693 --> 16:36.029
- I've never come out
on the winning end of one yet.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.632
- During the war, I got
a telegraph from my wife

16:39.699 --> 16:42.302
that said she was taking
another lover.

16:42.369 --> 16:46.106
And leaving with him on Friday.

16:46.173 --> 16:48.541
It was a Monday when I got
the telegraph.

16:48.608 --> 16:51.444
So, I got my sword real goddam
sharp to slice

16:51.511 --> 16:54.114
that son of a bitch,
and rode two days straight.

16:56.483 --> 17:01.888
When I got there she ran out
of the house and...

17:01.954 --> 17:03.323
tackled me in a hug.

17:05.825 --> 17:10.197
Said she'd read the Rebels
were in Pennsylvania

17:10.263 --> 17:13.933
and she dreamed that I was gonna
die on a battlefield

17:14.000 --> 17:15.068
at Gettysburg.

17:18.605 --> 17:20.807
That dirty, little liar
saved my life.

17:28.615 --> 17:30.517
- Josef's leg got's to come off.

17:31.984 --> 17:33.853
We should do it now.

17:36.189 --> 17:37.056
- All right.

18:03.416 --> 18:04.317
- Thank you.

18:14.894 --> 18:16.996
So we do this now?

18:17.063 --> 18:18.965
- Not yet.

18:19.031 --> 18:22.101
Not till you're so drunk
you can't see straight.

18:22.169 --> 18:24.737
Need about half
that bottle in you.

18:24.804 --> 18:26.239
- I'm German.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.441
Half this bottle
I'm just hitting my stride

18:43.290 --> 18:46.859
We had these stupid French
running through the streets

18:46.926 --> 18:49.196
of Paris like dogs.

18:49.262 --> 18:52.632
A-le-a-le-a-le...

18:54.000 --> 18:56.236
- You know what the hell
he's talking about?

18:57.804 --> 19:01.140
- Some battle.

19:01.208 --> 19:02.275
Don't matter.

19:02.342 --> 19:04.411
Sumbitch can drink
that whiskey.

19:05.845 --> 19:08.315
What no one...
understands about a battle

19:08.381 --> 19:10.116
is the noise.

19:11.918 --> 19:14.153
The noise of it...

19:14.221 --> 19:17.624
When they start,
you can hear the man

19:17.690 --> 19:21.928
beside you scream over
the bombs and rifles.

19:23.496 --> 19:29.769
Before long, you can't hear
the bombs over the screams...

19:30.903 --> 19:32.205
- Now we're getting somewhere.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.375
Finish that last swig, Josef.

19:47.287 --> 19:48.187
- Fuck.

19:54.427 --> 19:56.128
That ain't one
of yer good ones, is it?

19:56.195 --> 19:57.196
I don't have
a good one.

20:03.135 --> 20:05.705
- No, no, I'm not ready.

20:16.816 --> 20:19.151
- You just lay right there
and take a nap.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.620
We ain't starting nuthin'.

20:20.687 --> 20:21.754
- Don't you...

20:21.821 --> 20:23.590
- We ain't doing nuthin'.

20:23.656 --> 20:24.957
Just lay back and rest.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.629
Let's give him a few minutes.

20:44.544 --> 20:46.546
Y'all put your knees
on his arms.

20:46.613 --> 20:49.282
Press your hands
into his shoulders, hard.

20:49.349 --> 20:50.717
Thomas,
you might need that.

20:53.353 --> 20:54.253
- Which leg you want?

20:54.321 --> 20:55.755
- I'm working the saw.

20:55.822 --> 20:57.590
- I got the cutting leg.

20:59.626 --> 21:02.829
He's gonna try to kick the life
out of you when he comes to.

21:02.895 --> 21:04.331
- I don't think he's coming to.

21:04.397 --> 21:06.699
- Well, he's coming to.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.468
Okay Slow down.

21:17.276 --> 21:20.413
Cut around to the bone
first, yeah?

21:22.349 --> 21:23.816
- I'd go right to the saw.

21:25.452 --> 21:27.219
- It'll heal better this way.

21:28.855 --> 21:29.722
- Okay.

21:32.592 --> 21:33.693
- All right, y'all get on him.

21:56.916 --> 21:57.950
- Hold on.

22:04.891 --> 22:07.560
Hold him! Hold him!

22:16.002 --> 22:17.136
- Oh, my God.

22:24.043 --> 22:25.512
Gotta bury that leg.

22:25.578 --> 22:27.780
He don't need to see a coyote
running through the plains

22:27.847 --> 22:28.948
with his foot tomorrow.

22:32.785 --> 22:33.986
- Y'all can get up now.

22:36.856 --> 22:37.957
Are we in Montana?

22:45.297 --> 22:46.466
- Almost.

22:47.534 --> 22:48.668
- Hm.

22:48.735 --> 22:51.838
- Honey, you need to lay down.
- Mm.

22:51.904 --> 22:55.074
- I'm cold.
Wanna sit by the fire.

23:18.931 --> 23:20.332
There anything to eat?

23:21.834 --> 23:23.603
- I can sure make you something
real quick.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.753
- I'm sure glad I didn't get
shot in the leg.

23:51.731 --> 23:53.600
- Gonna have to hold out
for about fifteen minutes.

23:56.335 --> 23:57.403
- I ain't going nowhere.

24:05.512 --> 24:07.046
- Fever's broke.

24:07.113 --> 24:10.850
Color's back too.
That's good.

24:13.653 --> 24:15.221
How's the pain.

24:15.287 --> 24:18.525
- It's there,
but not like it was.

24:24.531 --> 24:25.832
- You want some bacon?

24:27.466 --> 24:28.968
- Sure.

24:44.450 --> 24:46.519
Y'all made good time.

24:46.586 --> 24:49.221
Went from prairie to pine trees
in a day.

24:50.389 --> 24:52.058
- We left the fort
three days ago.

24:55.394 --> 24:56.729
- Oh.

25:00.266 --> 25:04.336
Slept my way here, I guess.
- Yeah, honey. You sure did.

25:30.129 --> 25:33.800
- I'm not sure
what Oregon looks like

25:33.866 --> 25:35.735
but I bet it don't
look like this.

25:37.937 --> 25:40.039
Should have aimed for this place
from the start.

25:42.208 --> 25:43.876
- I don't know what Oregon looks
like either, honey,

25:43.943 --> 25:47.479
but this is hard to beat.

25:49.015 --> 25:52.084
- The only people who know what
it looks like are already there.

25:54.754 --> 25:57.056
Funny, when you
think about it.

25:59.558 --> 26:02.829
All those people from Europe...

26:02.895 --> 26:04.030
Don't speak our language...

26:05.965 --> 26:08.234
Don't know anything
about this place.

26:08.300 --> 26:12.338
Risking their lives
over rumors and dreams.

26:12.404 --> 26:15.842
- Rumors and dreams
built this whole world, honey.

26:15.908 --> 26:17.744
Every inch of it.

26:21.814 --> 26:24.016
- Wanna know my greatest fear
about dying?

26:26.018 --> 26:27.286
It's being forgotten.

26:28.988 --> 26:32.124
And I can't understand why cuz
I won't be here

26:32.191 --> 26:34.694
to know anyone forgot me.

26:34.761 --> 26:36.629
But the thought is terrifying.

26:38.831 --> 26:40.532
What a silly thing
to scare me.

26:41.668 --> 26:43.469
- Nobody's gonna
forget you, Elsa.

26:45.604 --> 26:46.739
And you ain't dying.

26:49.041 --> 26:50.677
You should be dead.

26:50.743 --> 26:53.579
But you pay about as much
attention to the rules of nature

26:53.646 --> 26:54.781
as you pay to mine.

26:59.151 --> 27:01.087
- You look at me like I'm dying.

27:03.322 --> 27:04.991
- I look at you
for what you are--

27:07.126 --> 27:09.228
the most important thing
to me on this planet.

27:10.897 --> 27:12.699
And that comes with
a lot of worry.

27:14.533 --> 27:15.868
Because I can't replace you.

27:21.607 --> 27:23.910
- The others were wrong
not to come with us.

27:26.112 --> 27:27.680
You think they'll make it
to Oregon?

27:29.949 --> 27:31.751
- I don't think they'll make it
out of Wyoming.

27:37.189 --> 27:38.024
- Me neither.

27:44.663 --> 27:48.534
- <i>We never spoke of dreams
or death again.</i>

27:48.600 --> 27:52.705
<i>Never spoke
of the Pioneers either.</i>

27:52.772 --> 27:54.473
<i>Because there was no need.</i>

28:28.040 --> 28:29.341
Come on! Let's go!

28:48.227 --> 28:52.198
<i>To survive the frontier,
you must learn to recognize</i>

28:52.264 --> 28:54.466
<i>those who won't.</i>

28:54.533 --> 28:58.370
<i>And be weary
of their doomed decisions.</i>

28:58.437 --> 29:02.308
<i>They are to be avoided at all
costs, because their fear</i>

29:02.374 --> 29:04.977
<i>is tragedy's closest cousin.</i>

29:05.044 --> 29:07.980
<i>And tragedy is contagious
in this place.</i>

30:29.862 --> 30:32.098
- Shea!
- Hold up here.

30:32.164 --> 30:33.065
Get ready.

30:37.469 --> 30:38.570
- In the foot locker!

31:06.632 --> 31:08.034
- She's hurt.

31:08.100 --> 31:12.404
- I know. Shot.
Lakota arrow.

31:13.572 --> 31:15.707
- They been making war?

31:15.774 --> 31:17.576
- Somebody made war on them.

31:17.643 --> 31:19.778
They thought it was us.

31:19.845 --> 31:22.514
- What do your, uh, doctors say?

31:22.581 --> 31:24.183
- We have no doctors.

31:25.417 --> 31:26.752
- I'll get you a doctor.

31:33.759 --> 31:35.327
We need to put her in the creek.

31:35.394 --> 31:36.828
- It's too cold.

31:36.895 --> 31:39.531
She's got a fever.

31:39.598 --> 31:41.968
- Cold is what she needs.

31:42.034 --> 31:43.369
Stop the bleeding.

31:58.184 --> 32:00.452
That was quite the battle, huh?

32:00.519 --> 32:01.954
- Was a good one.
-

32:04.890 --> 32:07.693
- You her father?

32:07.759 --> 32:08.827
- I can call him.

32:11.130 --> 32:11.998
- Call him.

36:08.800 --> 36:10.969
- You are her father.

36:11.036 --> 36:13.138
- I am.

36:13.205 --> 36:15.307
- What do you know of war?

36:17.909 --> 36:19.311
- More than I care to.

36:19.378 --> 36:20.946
- Mm.

36:21.012 --> 36:25.684
You know that the
Lakota, they dip their arrows

36:25.751 --> 36:29.655
in manure,
so a hit is fatal.

36:31.257 --> 36:34.125
And an arrow in the liver
is for certain.

36:34.192 --> 36:38.096
- I know what's coming.

36:38.163 --> 36:39.898
I just...

36:39.965 --> 36:41.900
Where we put her in the ground
is where we stay.

36:41.967 --> 36:44.236
And I gotta find
that place fast.

36:44.303 --> 36:47.639
Otherwise I'm living out here
in the sagebrush with you.

36:51.610 --> 36:54.813
I know a place for you.

36:54.880 --> 36:58.617
You go through that pass then
you follow the river south.

37:02.020 --> 37:04.790
I used to hunt that valley
as a boy.

37:06.592 --> 37:09.828
The winters are cruel,

37:09.895 --> 37:15.867
but the summer's are rich
and a man who plans can thrive.

37:15.934 --> 37:18.169
And you look like a man
who plans.

37:21.473 --> 37:22.608
- What's the valley called.

37:24.910 --> 37:29.114
- I don't know the word in your
language, but it's, uh...

37:29.180 --> 37:32.684
When you die, you go there.

37:32.751 --> 37:33.752
- Heaven.

37:36.288 --> 37:39.024
- No, there's
another word, it's not...

37:42.994 --> 37:44.363
- Paradise.

37:44.430 --> 37:51.202
- Yes, Paradise. Good name.

37:51.269 --> 37:57.142
that in seven generations

37:57.208 --> 38:00.746
my people will rise up,
and take it back from you.

38:00.812 --> 38:03.081
- In seven generations
you can have it.

38:03.148 --> 38:04.049
- Mm.

38:09.321 --> 38:11.423
How long's the trip?

38:11.490 --> 38:13.692
Depends how fast you ride.

38:13.759 --> 38:18.797
But with that wagon,
it will take a week.

38:18.864 --> 38:21.032
and she doesn't have that.

38:25.337 --> 38:29.608
Some day my family
might seek to hunt that valley

38:31.343 --> 38:36.915
and if they do,
you remember me.

38:36.982 --> 38:37.983
And you let them.

38:40.085 --> 38:41.620
- Your family can hunt
the day I get there

38:41.687 --> 38:43.021
and every day after.

38:43.088 --> 38:45.591
- Mm. Good.

39:03.174 --> 39:04.109
Feel better?

39:09.948 --> 39:11.617
- You lied.

39:16.722 --> 39:17.656
- I'm sorry.

39:23.795 --> 39:25.964
- I'm dying.

39:26.031 --> 39:27.966
- I know, honey.

39:45.817 --> 39:47.252
- Make me a promise.

39:49.054 --> 39:49.988
- Anything.

39:51.990 --> 39:55.761
- Let me choose the spot.
Please?

39:57.929 --> 39:58.897
- Yeah, honey.

40:04.202 --> 40:05.637
You choose the spot.

40:48.446 --> 40:52.350
- They're fine. Ate good.

40:52.417 --> 40:55.554
Went right to sleep.

40:55.621 --> 40:59.324
- They haven't spoken since
their father died...

40:59.390 --> 41:00.526
in Texas.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.730
- I couldn't get them
to shut up.

41:09.100 --> 41:10.101
- They talk to you?

41:11.703 --> 41:12.704
- All the time.

41:15.173 --> 41:20.712
Ask about what's this sound
and this animal...

41:23.815 --> 41:25.884
What's Oregon like...

41:27.819 --> 41:29.555
- They won't talk to me.

41:29.621 --> 41:30.556
For months.

41:32.290 --> 41:33.792
Guess I'd blame me too.

41:33.859 --> 41:35.160
- Ain't blame.

41:37.796 --> 41:39.497
They just don't know
what to say.

41:41.933 --> 41:44.002
After all they seen you
go through.

41:46.872 --> 41:50.108
It's the journey that keeps them
from talking with you.

41:52.778 --> 41:58.950
To them, you're this,
this giant egg...

41:59.017 --> 42:00.986
They're terrified
is gonna break.

42:03.555 --> 42:07.025
They talk to me cuz

42:07.092 --> 42:08.894
they couldn't care less
if I break.

42:11.863 --> 42:13.131
And that's fine.

42:16.602 --> 42:18.637
Guess I don't care
too much myself.

42:22.273 --> 42:24.209
- What happens in Oregon?

42:24.275 --> 42:26.444
- Don't know a thing
about Oregon.

42:27.979 --> 42:29.514
- With us, I mean.

42:31.482 --> 42:35.921
- Figure we find
a valley with, uh...

42:35.987 --> 42:38.724
some good water

42:38.790 --> 42:39.991
no people.

42:42.794 --> 42:45.731
Then we stake it out
and make it ours.

42:49.300 --> 42:51.136
And your boys
will talk to you again.

42:54.572 --> 42:56.041
Cuz the journey's over.

43:24.269 --> 43:26.004
- I've lost a daughter too.

43:31.643 --> 43:33.679
Time will come
when you blame yourself.

43:36.314 --> 43:37.548
Think it's your fault.

43:39.484 --> 43:41.119
For giving her so much rein.

43:44.022 --> 43:45.423
And maybe it is your fault...

43:49.094 --> 43:52.030
But I'll say this--

43:52.097 --> 43:55.000
I've watched this girl
for the last six months

43:55.066 --> 43:57.268
and she has outlived us all.

43:59.705 --> 44:05.643
I'm 75 years old
and she has out-smiled me,

44:05.711 --> 44:11.516
out-loved me, out-fought me...

44:11.582 --> 44:15.620
She's outlived me.

44:15.687 --> 44:17.622
She's out-lived all of us.

44:22.560 --> 44:25.931
- She wants to pick the spot
where she's buried.

44:29.968 --> 44:32.603
She wants to choose it.
Put eyes on it.

44:37.776 --> 44:40.045
These wagons won't make
the trip in time.

44:43.581 --> 44:46.151
My boy can't make the trip
on horseback.

44:46.217 --> 44:48.153
- Mm-hm.

44:48.219 --> 44:49.654
- And I gave her my word.

44:49.721 --> 44:54.259
I can't let her life end
with me breaking it.

44:55.994 --> 45:01.232
And I have absolutely no idea
how to tell my wife...

45:01.299 --> 45:04.669
I gotta take her daughter
away from her....

45:04.736 --> 45:07.739
To die...

45:07.806 --> 45:09.908
And she can't go.

45:13.511 --> 45:15.747
She'll hear the logic
in it from you.

45:18.750 --> 45:23.288
From me, all she'll hear
is the cruelty in it.

45:29.227 --> 45:30.628
You think you can
do that for me?

45:33.264 --> 45:34.099
Please...

45:40.171 --> 45:43.208
- Yeah.

45:43.274 --> 45:44.709
I can do that for ya.

46:15.406 --> 46:16.241
Ma'am?

46:22.780 --> 46:26.184
- So, what is my husband
too scared to ask me?

46:30.721 --> 46:33.724
- He promised your daughter she
could choose where she dies.

46:35.460 --> 46:36.828
And that's where you
build the ranch.

46:41.266 --> 46:43.101
But it's a week's drive
on a wagon.

46:44.402 --> 46:45.470
She ain't got a week.

46:47.538 --> 46:48.974
Horse can make it in two days.

46:51.676 --> 46:53.578
- Still haven't heard
a question.

46:55.380 --> 47:01.352
- Well, I really don't know
what the question is , ma'am.

47:05.256 --> 47:07.625
I guess the question is,
are you willing to say goodbye

47:07.692 --> 47:08.526
to her here.

47:12.330 --> 47:14.599
- Men are such fucking cowards.

47:28.346 --> 47:30.581
- It ain't cowardice, ma'am.

47:30.648 --> 47:33.018
It's a shame that the question's
even being asked.

47:35.286 --> 47:37.655
- When do they leave?

47:37.722 --> 47:38.789
- Should leave in the morning.

47:59.344 --> 48:00.245
- I'm sorry.

48:04.749 --> 48:05.816
Ain't no other way.

50:02.633 --> 50:03.568
- I love you.

50:04.669 --> 50:05.636
- I love you both.

50:06.737 --> 50:07.672
With all my heart.

50:09.507 --> 50:10.841
- I'll see you
in the valley, mama.

50:12.510 --> 50:13.411
- See you there.

50:35.300 --> 50:37.268
- I hope you prove 'em
all wrong.

50:37.335 --> 50:41.339
Hope you laugh about this
in twenty years.

50:41.406 --> 50:43.674
Laugh at all of us
for doubting you.

50:43.741 --> 50:44.942
- Well, if I can't...

50:48.313 --> 50:49.814
I'll come
meet you on the beach.

50:51.182 --> 50:52.417
- I'll save you a spot.

50:57.122 --> 50:58.423
We'll be right behind you.

51:00.925 --> 51:02.427
- Keep 'em close.

51:02.493 --> 51:03.861
- Like they were my own.

52:43.060 --> 52:45.496
This way. Here.

53:07.352 --> 53:08.253
Stop.

53:20.898 --> 53:22.132
This is the spot.

53:24.402 --> 53:25.336
- Where do you want to go?

53:28.306 --> 53:29.374
- Against the tree.

54:15.252 --> 54:16.721
Let's just sit here and...

54:20.090 --> 54:21.091
Rest for a bit.

54:23.794 --> 54:24.862
- You want a blanket?

54:26.764 --> 54:27.698
- No.

54:29.334 --> 54:30.635
You be the blanket.

54:38.108 --> 54:39.644
What's your first memory?

54:42.880 --> 54:46.417
- I was...probably three
I reckon.

54:49.520 --> 54:51.088
My daddy had an apprentice.

54:52.990 --> 54:55.059
And he was banging horse shoes.

54:57.962 --> 54:59.263
I remember the sparks.

55:04.034 --> 55:09.106
He looked up at me
and he smiled...

55:09.173 --> 55:13.844
put his hands over his eyes,
and said "peekaboo I see you,"

55:18.015 --> 55:20.951
then he covered his eyes
with his hands,

55:21.018 --> 55:23.287
and he said
you can't see me."

55:23.354 --> 55:24.254
"Where am I."

55:28.659 --> 55:29.860
I didn't understand
the game,

55:31.996 --> 55:36.266
I mean, he was hiding
behind his hands.

55:36.333 --> 55:38.536
And I could see him.

55:38.603 --> 55:40.037
Plain as day.

55:44.942 --> 55:46.577
And I thought he was a fool.

55:51.982 --> 55:53.050
- Mine was...

55:58.689 --> 56:00.525
All of these birds...

56:07.965 --> 56:09.500
In the field behind the house.

56:12.302 --> 56:13.971
Right after a rain.

56:22.480 --> 56:23.914
Pecking at the ground.

56:27.452 --> 56:28.953
Pulling out worms.

56:33.524 --> 56:35.025
And I thought...

56:38.262 --> 56:44.068
"How smart. Wait for the rain
to soften the earth."

56:50.575 --> 56:52.710
I just thought that
was so smart.

56:56.614 --> 57:00.585
- You were right, honey.
That was smart.

57:37.955 --> 57:40.190
- You birds sure are smart.

57:47.598 --> 57:48.499
- Honey...

57:50.467 --> 57:51.969
Honey...

57:59.343 --> 58:01.211
- I understand it now.

58:03.380 --> 58:04.414
- Understand what?

58:06.216 --> 58:07.785
- I know what it is.

58:10.855 --> 58:12.456
And I'm not scared.

58:15.392 --> 58:17.161
I'm not scared, daddy.

1:00:18.382 --> 1:00:19.316
- This is it.

1:00:22.586 --> 1:00:24.354
- Mama! There's a river!

1:00:27.391 --> 1:00:28.826
- Is it too far?

1:00:28.893 --> 1:00:30.594
- Ain't nothing too far for us.

1:00:33.263 --> 1:00:35.966
You want the river...

1:00:36.033 --> 1:00:37.267
I'll stake you a river.

1:01:13.804 --> 1:01:15.205
- Just look at that, Helen.

1:01:17.207 --> 1:01:18.308
Isn't that beautiful...

1:02:14.164 --> 1:02:16.867
- <i>There is a moment where
your dreams and your memories</i>

1:02:16.934 --> 1:02:20.805
<i>merge together,
and form a perfect world.</i>

1:02:22.672 --> 1:02:25.542
<i>That is Heaven.</i>

1:02:25.609 --> 1:02:27.912
<i>And each Heaven is unique.</i>

1:02:27.978 --> 1:02:29.613
<i>It is the world of you.</i>

1:02:34.184 --> 1:02:38.455
<i>The land is filled
with all you hold dear</i>

1:02:38.522 --> 1:02:40.724
<i>and the sky is your
imagination.</i>

1:03:09.586 --> 1:03:15.292
<i>My Heaven is filled with good
horses and open plains</i>

1:03:15.359 --> 1:03:19.296
<i>and wild cattle
and a man who loves me.</i>

1:03:27.571 --> 1:03:28.638
- Race ya.

1:03:43.854 --> 1:03:46.156
<i>It is always sunrise
in my world...</i>

1:03:48.192 --> 1:03:50.160
<i>And there are no storms.</i>

1:03:51.595 --> 1:03:53.163
<i>I am the only lighting.</i>

1:04:03.140 --> 1:04:04.308
<i>I know death now.</i>

1:04:06.643 --> 1:04:07.577
<i>I've seen it.</i>

1:04:09.379 --> 1:04:10.780
<i>It had no fangs.</i>

1:04:12.682 --> 1:04:14.018
<i>It smiled at me.</i>

1:04:16.786 --> 1:04:18.889
<i>And it was beautiful.</i>
