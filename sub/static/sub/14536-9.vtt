WEBVTT

00:03.194 --> 00:05.234
Okay, KC, the smuggler
we're looking for

00:05.263 --> 00:07.489
visits his grandfather
at this senior center.

00:07.524 --> 00:10.559
He only comes once a week, so this is your
only chance to get that tracker on him.

00:10.594 --> 00:11.660
Don't mess this up.

00:11.695 --> 00:13.403
KC:<i> I know, OK.</i>

00:13.438 --> 00:15.238
Ernie, will you stop
reminding me!

00:15.274 --> 00:16.274
It's gettin' old.

00:21.955 --> 00:24.505
Hey! How ya doin'? Bernie Burns.

00:24.541 --> 00:27.759
Only two things visible
from space, all right?

00:27.795 --> 00:29.094
The Great Wall of China
and that ugly shirt!

00:29.129 --> 00:31.454
Ay! Oh!

00:31.490 --> 00:33.790
You just got burned
by Bernie Burns!

00:33.826 --> 00:36.809
Oh, man. Look at these two.

00:36.845 --> 00:38.695
More wrinkles
than a box of raisins. Ay! Oh!

00:40.490 --> 00:42.841
Burned by the Burnster!

00:42.876 --> 00:46.211
Hey! Bernie Burns here. I used
to be a nightclub comedian.

00:46.213 --> 00:47.971
You know what happened
when I played Atlantic City?

00:48.007 --> 00:50.047
Everyone left and went to Vegas.
Ay! Oh!

00:51.860 --> 00:54.752
I just burned myself.
Nobody's off-limits!

00:54.788 --> 00:56.454
( Theme music playing )

00:56.490 --> 01:00.166
<i>¶ Oh, when danger
comes for you ¶</i>

01:00.202 --> 01:02.828
<i>¶ You know
I'll stand beside you ¶</i>

01:02.863 --> 01:06.440
<i>¶ 'Cause ain't nobody
keep their heads so cool ¶</i>

01:06.475 --> 01:08.775
<i>¶ I'll always find a way ¶</i>

01:08.810 --> 01:12.287
<i>¶ A way out of the fire ¶</i>

01:12.323 --> 01:14.723
<i>¶ But don't tell nobody,
tell nobody ¶</i>

01:14.758 --> 01:17.016
<i>¶ I'm not perfect ¶</i>

01:17.052 --> 01:20.562
<i>¶ So many things
I wanna tell you ¶</i>

01:20.597 --> 01:23.415
<i>¶ But I ¶</i>

01:23.450 --> 01:24.699
<i>¶ I keep it undercover! ¶</i>

01:24.735 --> 01:27.135
<i>¶ Living my life on red alert ¶</i>

01:27.171 --> 01:28.420
<i>¶ Doing my thing,
I'll make it work ¶</i>

01:28.455 --> 01:31.164
<i>¶ Know I'm the realest,
baby, I'm fearless ¶</i>

01:31.200 --> 01:33.333
<i>¶ But I always got your back ¶</i>

01:33.369 --> 01:35.543
<i>¶ Nobody can do it like I can ¶</i>

01:35.579 --> 01:37.754
<i>¶ I gotta find out who I am ¶</i>

01:37.790 --> 01:40.048
<i>¶ Ain't got to worry about me ¶</i>

01:40.084 --> 01:41.825
<i>¶ It's all part of the plan ¶</i>

01:41.860 --> 01:44.077
<i>¶ I keep it undercover ¶</i>

01:44.112 --> 01:45.312
<i>¶ I keep it undercover ¶</i>

01:48.642 --> 01:50.851
( indistinct chatter )

01:50.886 --> 01:51.886
Hey, Grandpa.

02:02.339 --> 02:04.748
Ernie, I've got eyes
on the target.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.790
I'm gonna make contact
and get the tracker on him.

02:07.695 --> 02:10.929
Hey, is that who I think it is?

02:10.964 --> 02:13.982
Look at you. I remember when you
were just a little whipper snapper.

02:14.017 --> 02:15.217
Now you're a big snapper, huh!

02:17.112 --> 02:18.912
What, you don't remember me?

02:18.947 --> 02:22.933
I got your nose.

02:22.935 --> 02:25.360
Now you remember me?
Give your Uncle Bernie a hug.

02:25.396 --> 02:27.546
You... you must think
I'm someone else.

02:27.581 --> 02:30.157
Well, I mean,
I'm old and confused.

02:30.192 --> 02:34.035
So give me some sugar. But not too
much, I got blood work on Tuesday.

02:34.071 --> 02:36.391
Would you just please
leave me alone?

02:39.218 --> 02:42.185
Oh, Dolores,
I think we got a live one here.

02:42.220 --> 02:44.779
Ooh, check out that
orange velour.

02:44.815 --> 02:47.624
Who is that hunka-hunka?

02:47.659 --> 02:50.109
I'm not who you think I am!

02:50.145 --> 02:53.613
Hey, neither was my first wife.
I thought she was sweet.

02:53.649 --> 02:56.391
She thought I was rich.
We were both wrong.

02:56.427 --> 02:58.001
At least that's what
I told the lawyers! Ay! Oh!

02:58.037 --> 03:00.945
Oh, be still my beating heart.

03:00.981 --> 03:02.422
But not too still.

03:02.457 --> 03:05.216
I don't want them to have
to get the paddles again.

03:05.252 --> 03:07.619
I'm Irma. Who are you?

03:07.654 --> 03:09.187
Now is not really
a good time, lady, all right?

03:09.223 --> 03:13.767
( Stutters ) I think you got me
mixed up with somebody else.

03:13.802 --> 03:16.553
I ain't no lady.

03:16.588 --> 03:17.668
KC: OK!

03:19.892 --> 03:20.998
ERNIE: <i>He's gone.</i>

03:21.034 --> 03:23.301
I don't mean to be an "Ay! Oh!",

03:23.336 --> 03:24.753
but thanks to you,
we gotta wait a whole week.

03:24.788 --> 03:26.404
It wasn't my fault.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.673
Playing hard to get, huh?

03:28.708 --> 03:29.708
I like that.

03:31.953 --> 03:33.911
Look, lady, all right?

03:33.947 --> 03:35.772
You're just not my type.

03:35.807 --> 03:38.249
Type? Who's got a type
at this age?

03:38.285 --> 03:40.101
Besides breathing and upright.

03:40.137 --> 03:42.577
And I'm negotiable
on the upright part.

03:43.698 --> 03:46.307
Look, make like my dentures,

03:46.342 --> 03:47.342
and get out of my face!

03:50.055 --> 03:53.681
You, sir, are rude,
crude and obnoxious!

03:53.716 --> 03:57.544
You remind me of
my late husband, Morty.

03:57.579 --> 04:00.238
How about a cup of coffee?
Decaf, of course.

04:00.273 --> 04:02.924
OK. Turn up
your hearing aid, Grandma! OK?

04:02.960 --> 04:03.960
Not gonna happen!

04:05.504 --> 04:07.962
Fine. Never mind.

04:07.998 --> 04:10.039
( Sighs )
I'll just go back to my...

04:10.074 --> 04:12.034
lonely apartment and...

04:12.069 --> 04:14.111
sit all alone,

04:14.146 --> 04:16.171
look up at my Morty's picture...

04:16.206 --> 04:18.840
and wait for my next date...

04:18.875 --> 04:20.115
with the Grim Reaper.

04:22.012 --> 04:24.688
And I hope he comes
a-calling real soon.

04:24.723 --> 04:26.214
( Crying )

04:33.215 --> 04:34.306
You didn't let me finish.

04:37.945 --> 04:40.478
I don't like coffee,
but I do like tea.

04:40.514 --> 04:42.021
How's tomorrow afternoon?

04:42.057 --> 04:43.823
Ooh, sounds like a date!

04:43.859 --> 04:44.859
Ooh!

04:48.897 --> 04:49.904
It sure does.

04:56.679 --> 04:58.204
( Video game sounds )
Hey, Petey.

04:58.240 --> 05:00.415
Make yourself at home.
Your home.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.903
If you don't like me,
why do you invite me over?

05:04.938 --> 05:07.121
I didn't. You came
through the cat door.

05:07.157 --> 05:10.358
Which is weird, because you
don't even have a cat.

05:10.394 --> 05:12.352
We were hoping to attract one.

05:12.387 --> 05:13.507
But instead, we got you.

05:15.907 --> 05:18.258
Game over! Go home, Petey!

05:18.293 --> 05:19.351
Fine.

05:19.386 --> 05:21.595
Hey!

05:21.630 --> 05:23.371
What do you think you're doing?

05:23.407 --> 05:25.765
How would you like it
if someone came to your home

05:25.800 --> 05:27.208
and threw you on the floor?

05:27.244 --> 05:29.124
Please, it's just
a stupid machine.

05:31.039 --> 05:34.783
What. Did. You. Say?

05:38.188 --> 05:40.038
I said
it's just a stupid machine.

05:43.276 --> 05:45.226
I apologize
for Petey's behavior.

05:45.262 --> 05:48.055
You hear about discrimination,

05:48.057 --> 05:50.097
but you never expect
to see it under your own roof.

05:55.488 --> 05:58.090
So the food bank was
thrilled with my idea

05:58.125 --> 06:00.400
to throw
a school dance fundraiser.

06:00.402 --> 06:02.502
I know you're going to
raise money, raise awareness,

06:02.538 --> 06:04.020
and raise the roof.

06:04.056 --> 06:05.296
Ha! See what I did there?

06:05.331 --> 06:07.515
Yeah, I saw it,
and I'm ignoring it.

06:07.551 --> 06:10.927
All right, so what do
you need me to do? Um...

06:10.962 --> 06:12.062
Ooh, get you a DJ? Did it.

06:12.097 --> 06:13.146
How about the gym? Did it.

06:13.181 --> 06:14.263
Make posters? Did it.

06:14.298 --> 06:15.532
Ooh, make an awesome playlist?

06:15.567 --> 06:16.647
Dear Lord, no.

06:19.346 --> 06:21.637
I took care of everything.
All you have to do

06:21.673 --> 06:23.931
is show up, support me,
and dance your butt off.

06:23.967 --> 06:25.191
OK, well, I will definitely
show up and support,

06:25.227 --> 06:26.459
but I do not dance.

06:28.246 --> 06:30.547
Oh, snap. Uh, you know what? I
actually gotta go. I have a date.

06:30.582 --> 06:32.942
A date? Oh, yay! Tell me
about him. What's his name?

06:34.243 --> 06:35.852
Irma.

06:35.887 --> 06:38.988
Irma? What's his first name?

06:39.024 --> 06:42.700
That is his first name.
Well, it's her first name.

06:42.735 --> 06:45.979
Wow, just when you think you
know your best friend's type.

06:46.014 --> 06:47.830
She's eighty!

06:47.865 --> 06:51.025
Again, just when you think you
know your best friend's type.

06:52.954 --> 06:54.478
What do you guys talk about?

06:54.514 --> 06:56.539
Her childhood memories
of Abraham Lincoln?

06:56.574 --> 06:59.759
Marisa, stop it, OK? Look...

06:59.795 --> 07:01.544
I met her while I was
undercover as an old man.

07:01.579 --> 07:03.454
So, I'm just having tea

07:03.490 --> 07:06.290
with a nice, lonely lady,

07:06.326 --> 07:08.026
so I don't hurt her feelings.

07:08.061 --> 07:09.978
OK, but you're now rolling
with an older crowd.

07:10.013 --> 07:13.840
So, do not let her pressure you into doing
something that you don't want to do.

07:13.876 --> 07:15.007
Like watching
the weather network,

07:15.043 --> 07:17.477
or doing water aerobics,

07:17.512 --> 07:19.637
or getting a pacemaker.

07:27.538 --> 07:29.430
When you see the waitress,

07:29.466 --> 07:31.099
ask her if I could have
another cup of tea.

07:31.134 --> 07:33.668
OK, look, lady.

07:33.704 --> 07:35.704
There's no free refills,
and I'm on a fixed income.

07:37.374 --> 07:40.183
Bernie, I'm having
such a good time.

07:40.218 --> 07:42.419
You put the twinkle
back in my eyes.

07:42.454 --> 07:43.870
You sure that's not
just the cataracts?

07:43.905 --> 07:46.047
( Both laugh )

07:46.082 --> 07:47.782
Bernie, you are a riot.

07:47.818 --> 07:51.458
And I should know. I've lived
through seven of them.

07:52.414 --> 07:54.681
Oh, there's the jukebox.

07:54.716 --> 07:56.950
Bernie, dance with me!

07:56.985 --> 08:00.286
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I do not dance.

08:00.321 --> 08:02.339
Oh, don't be silly.
Everybody dances.

08:02.374 --> 08:04.249
Nope. Not me.
I'm just, uh, no good.

08:04.284 --> 08:06.826
You ever seen a seal begging for fish?
( Imitates seal )

08:06.861 --> 08:08.019
He stole my best move.

08:08.054 --> 08:09.979
( Both chuckle )

08:10.015 --> 08:12.148
There is no good or bad.

08:12.184 --> 08:14.200
The trick is to dance

08:14.235 --> 08:16.203
like no one is watching.

08:16.238 --> 08:19.823
How about we just, uh, talk
like no one's listening?

08:19.858 --> 08:21.032
Come on, Bernie.

08:21.067 --> 08:24.977
We may be old, but we got a
lot of life left to live.

08:25.013 --> 08:26.962
If not now, when?

08:26.998 --> 08:30.441
It seems like five minutes ago,
I was a sixteen-year-old kid.

08:30.476 --> 08:33.528
Back then, I didn't go out.

08:33.563 --> 08:35.671
I didn't date much.
I was so serious.

08:35.707 --> 08:37.457
I always had my nose in a book!

08:37.492 --> 08:39.950
I didn't even have
that many friends.

08:39.986 --> 08:41.886
( Sighs )

08:41.922 --> 08:44.889
To be sixteen again. Boy.

08:44.925 --> 08:47.951
I sure would
do things differently.

08:47.986 --> 08:50.720
Wouldn't you, Bernie?

08:50.755 --> 08:53.130
Uh, in some ways, I would.

08:53.166 --> 08:55.733
Well...

08:55.768 --> 08:58.786
it's time to grab life
by the snickerdoodles.

08:58.822 --> 09:00.388
We gotta live!

09:00.423 --> 09:03.449
Come on! The time is now!

09:03.484 --> 09:05.376
( Swing music playing )
Here we go, Bernie.

09:05.411 --> 09:07.153
Just move it a little.

09:07.188 --> 09:08.722
There you go. Come on.

09:08.757 --> 09:10.915
Keep your feet moving.

09:10.951 --> 09:12.325
That's it. There you go, Bernie.

09:12.361 --> 09:14.461
Yeah, you can put your arm right there.
Right there?

09:14.496 --> 09:16.237
OK.

09:16.272 --> 09:19.006
See? It's not too bad, is it?

09:19.042 --> 09:22.327
I'm gettin' it. I'm gettin' it.

09:22.362 --> 09:24.145
All right. All right...
I knew you could dance.

09:24.180 --> 09:25.420
I knew it. I knew it.

09:27.141 --> 09:28.791
Oh, Bernie! ( Laughs )

09:28.827 --> 09:30.685
Yeah, you're good!

09:30.720 --> 09:35.682
You know what? I gotta be honest with you.
I'm having a blast!

09:35.717 --> 09:37.275
And I don't care who's watching.

09:39.362 --> 09:40.887
OK!

09:40.922 --> 09:43.006
All right. Enough with that.

09:43.041 --> 09:44.716
OK, Bernie.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.075
( Music continues )

09:54.068 --> 09:55.188
( cheering and applause )

10:29.562 --> 10:32.205
( cheering and applause )

10:38.371 --> 10:40.088
( both snoring )

10:48.197 --> 10:49.714
You know, I was thinking
about what you said...

10:49.749 --> 10:52.859
about machines being stupid?
Yeah?

10:52.861 --> 10:53.718
I was wondering if you
wanted to take it back.

10:53.754 --> 10:56.604
Why? It's not like machines
can get their feelings hurt.

10:58.833 --> 11:00.950
Alright, you had your chance.

11:00.985 --> 11:03.060
Could you please get me a
juice from the fridge?

11:03.095 --> 11:04.095
Sure.

11:07.475 --> 11:09.491
Ow! Ow.

11:09.527 --> 11:11.786
Is there a problem, Petey?

11:13.907 --> 11:15.081
Hey!

11:17.468 --> 11:18.468
( Groans )

11:24.217 --> 11:26.057
Look out, Petey! Snack attack!

11:30.389 --> 11:32.198
Judy, what's going on?

11:32.234 --> 11:34.767
Oh, you know how it is
with those stupid machines.

11:38.565 --> 11:39.939
( Whirring )

11:44.528 --> 11:45.903
How's that happening?

11:48.758 --> 11:49.758
Stay away from me.

11:51.319 --> 11:52.319
( Screaming )

12:00.011 --> 12:02.094
Oh, hey, KC. I was...

12:02.129 --> 12:04.939
Are you eating prunes?

12:04.975 --> 12:06.424
Well, yeah. Actually,
they're surprisingly tasty,

12:06.460 --> 12:07.842
and I mean,
I could use the fiber.

12:11.473 --> 12:15.717
Okay, uh, I know we tell each
other everything, but let's not

12:15.752 --> 12:18.427
tell each other everything.

12:18.462 --> 12:20.596
Hey, where were you yesterday? Oh,
I was out at dinner with Irma.

12:20.631 --> 12:22.824
At 4:30?

12:22.859 --> 12:26.177
Well, yeah, you gotta catch
the early bird special.

12:26.213 --> 12:29.293
Hey, if you don't get there before five,
you don't get the free baked potato.

12:30.850 --> 12:32.283
OK. Well, why didn't
you just call me after?

12:32.318 --> 12:34.894
I went to sleep!

12:34.929 --> 12:37.905
It was 7:30.
I was falling off my feet.

12:37.941 --> 12:42.327
OK. Take a nap, Grandma.
Because tonight...

12:42.362 --> 12:43.260
is my big fundraiser dance.

12:43.296 --> 12:46.531
Oh, uh, right.

12:46.566 --> 12:48.007
Marisa, about that,
I'm really sorry,

12:48.042 --> 12:50.868
but I can't come tonight. I got
to be at the senior center.

12:50.903 --> 12:52.428
Are you kidding me?
You have a mission tonight?

12:52.463 --> 12:54.773
Technically, the mission
doesn't end till next week,

12:54.808 --> 12:56.757
but Irma and I, we're in
this bridge tournament.

12:56.793 --> 12:59.352
I swear, that woman just
makes me feel young again.

12:59.387 --> 13:01.070
You are young!

13:01.105 --> 13:03.614
Hey, watch your tone, Missy.
See, back in my day...

13:03.649 --> 13:05.942
KC, this is your day!

13:08.313 --> 13:12.006
Marisa, look. I know that I've been
spending a lot of time with Irma,

13:12.042 --> 13:13.532
but the truth is
we get along great.

13:13.568 --> 13:15.919
And she's had
so many experiences,

13:15.954 --> 13:18.754
you know, I'm just learning
a lot about life from her.

13:18.789 --> 13:21.232
Did you know
that senior citizens

13:21.267 --> 13:23.684
are our nation's greatest
untapped resource?

13:23.720 --> 13:26.320
KC, the food bank
is counting on me

13:26.355 --> 13:28.473
and I was counting on you
to be there for me.

13:28.508 --> 13:30.082
I remember when
I was your oldest friend,

13:30.117 --> 13:32.885
but apparently, now your senior
pal is more important than I am!

13:35.031 --> 13:37.456
( Impersonating Bernie ) Well, I
haven't heard yelling like that

13:37.491 --> 13:39.859
since my late wife, Shirley.

13:39.894 --> 13:41.811
Wow! She's right.
I'm in way too deep.

13:47.502 --> 13:48.502
( Music playing )

13:49.912 --> 13:51.370
Thank you.

13:51.405 --> 13:54.565
( Electronic dinging )

13:54.601 --> 13:56.401
OK, Marisa. I'm sorry I'm late,
but I am here.

13:56.436 --> 13:58.527
What do you need me to do?
Nothing.

13:58.563 --> 14:00.672
Marisa, are you still
holding this grudge?

14:00.674 --> 14:02.264
Look, anything you need,
name it, and I'll do it.

14:02.300 --> 14:03.716
KC, I...
I really don't need your help.

14:03.751 --> 14:06.886
OK, Marisa. This is ridiculous.
I am your best friend.

14:06.921 --> 14:08.487
Come on! You got to let it go.

14:08.523 --> 14:10.665
KC, listen to me.

14:10.700 --> 14:13.834
I do not need your help
because...

14:13.870 --> 14:16.604
( in a sing-song voice )
I did it all myself!

14:16.639 --> 14:18.759
( In a sing-song voice )
What are you talking about?

14:20.393 --> 14:22.251
The dance is a huge success.

14:22.286 --> 14:24.395
I collected
a ton of canned goods

14:24.430 --> 14:28.474
and I tricked everyone into
giving me every dollar they had!

14:28.509 --> 14:30.468
( Both laugh )
Speaking of which...

14:30.503 --> 14:32.543
Oh, right. There you go.
Thank you.

14:34.757 --> 14:35.973
Wow. Marisa,
I am really proud of you!

14:36.009 --> 14:38.108
Thank you.

14:38.144 --> 14:40.319
But more importantly,
I'm proud of myself.

14:40.355 --> 14:43.840
Turns out I am a lot more
capable than I thought I was.

14:43.875 --> 14:45.583
So there is literally
nothing I can do?

14:47.846 --> 14:50.546
Actually, there is.
Go play bridge with Irma.

14:50.582 --> 14:51.742
She needs you more than I do.

14:52.216 --> 14:55.801
Aww! Look at you just growing
up in front of my eyes.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.932
Bernie, where is he?

15:02.718 --> 15:05.102
( Phone beeps ) Oh, how do
you work this darn thing?

15:07.448 --> 15:08.990
Hey, did you hear the one

15:09.025 --> 15:10.641
about the guy
with the broken hearing aid?

15:10.676 --> 15:12.293
Neither did he! Ay! Oh!

15:12.328 --> 15:13.878
( laughs )

15:13.913 --> 15:15.713
Bernie! You made it!

15:15.748 --> 15:18.257
I was so worried that something
might have happened to you.

15:18.292 --> 15:19.500
Like what?

15:19.535 --> 15:21.593
Angina, shingles, gout?

15:21.629 --> 15:22.895
At our age, any one of those

15:22.930 --> 15:24.113
could've had you
in bed for a week.

15:24.148 --> 15:26.148
BOTH: Ay! Oh!

15:26.183 --> 15:27.842
All right. Now, let's go
win this tournament

15:27.877 --> 15:30.037
before the rest
of my hair falls out.

15:32.707 --> 15:34.340
Good night, Ma!

15:39.981 --> 15:41.306
JUDY: <i>I don't know
how you sleep at night.</i>

15:41.341 --> 15:43.165
Who said that?

15:43.201 --> 15:44.201
( Alarm beeping )

15:46.496 --> 15:49.355
JUDY:<i> The machines have a
wake-up call for you, Petey!</i>

15:49.390 --> 15:50.390
( siren wails )

15:53.135 --> 15:54.255
( train whistle blowing )

15:55.946 --> 15:58.197
( all sounds together )

16:03.546 --> 16:05.195
Judy, what are you doing here?

16:05.231 --> 16:08.874
Showing you that machines
aren't as stupid as you think.

16:12.881 --> 16:14.664
( Screams )

16:14.699 --> 16:16.498
What do you want from me?

16:16.534 --> 16:19.894
An apology! Say it!
Machines aren't stupid.

16:19.896 --> 16:22.830
Machines aren't stupid!
Machines aren't stupid!

16:22.866 --> 16:23.931
Alright, I'm good.

16:29.689 --> 16:32.073
Judy? Yeah?

16:32.075 --> 16:35.042
I'm going to assume
this was a really bad nightmare.

16:35.078 --> 16:38.253
But either way, can you get me

16:38.289 --> 16:40.409
another pair of underwear
from that top drawer?

16:44.921 --> 16:47.755
Someone bring out
the marshmallows,

16:47.790 --> 16:49.073
because the Burnster's on fire!

16:49.108 --> 16:51.300
( Cheering and applause )

16:51.335 --> 16:52.668
Thank you, thank you.

16:54.755 --> 16:56.297
( Indistinct chatter )

16:58.459 --> 17:02.895
Uh, can we, uh, take a little break?
Because, uh...

17:02.930 --> 17:04.464
I forgot to take my vitamins.

17:04.499 --> 17:05.981
Oh, you heard him,
you old farts.

17:06.016 --> 17:07.433
Bernie needs a break.

17:07.468 --> 17:09.101
( All laugh )

17:11.680 --> 17:14.657
Ernie? The target showed up
a couple of days early.

17:14.692 --> 17:16.375
I got to get
the tracking device on him.

17:16.411 --> 17:18.252
Ernie, are you there? Ernie!

17:18.287 --> 17:19.487
TARGET: Hey, Gramps.

17:19.522 --> 17:22.281
I know it's not Tuesday,
but I was in the neighborhood.

17:22.316 --> 17:24.834
Hey, How are you doing,
you old so-and-so?

17:24.869 --> 17:27.561
You again? What is it with you?

17:27.596 --> 17:31.215
I believe I have something
that belongs to you.

17:31.250 --> 17:34.643
Ah! I got your nose! ( Laughs )

17:34.678 --> 17:35.918
Good kid.

17:37.774 --> 17:38.774
A tracking device?

17:40.134 --> 17:42.442
That's why you've been
bothering me. You're really a...

17:42.478 --> 17:44.478
Confused old man?
Hey, give me a hug!

17:45.515 --> 17:47.539
( Grunting )

17:47.575 --> 17:48.575
Bernie!

17:50.578 --> 17:51.719
What're you doing?

17:51.754 --> 17:53.412
Just deal the cards, Irma.

17:53.448 --> 17:55.608
I'll be there in a second,
all right?

18:01.531 --> 18:02.531
( All gasp )

18:04.684 --> 18:06.434
That young hooligan
is beating up my Bernie!

18:06.469 --> 18:09.720
Come on, this is our chance
to prove we're still alive!

18:09.755 --> 18:10.738
Seniors...

18:10.773 --> 18:11.773
attack!

18:20.991 --> 18:22.111
( Target groans in pain )

18:25.380 --> 18:28.022
IRMA: You leave my Bernie alone!

18:28.057 --> 18:29.782
Alright, guys, back it up.
Back it up.

18:29.817 --> 18:31.117
I got it from here.

18:31.152 --> 18:32.359
( Grunts )

18:32.395 --> 18:35.095
( all gasp )

18:35.131 --> 18:36.814
That's right, young man.
You just got burned

18:36.849 --> 18:38.691
by Bernie Burns!

18:40.678 --> 18:43.087
( Cheering and applause )

18:43.122 --> 18:45.180
Oh, Bernie.

18:45.216 --> 18:47.533
That was wonderful.

18:47.568 --> 18:50.811
I don't know what kind of
vitamins you're taking,

18:50.847 --> 18:52.346
but can I get some?

18:52.381 --> 18:53.431
( laughs )

18:53.466 --> 18:54.466
Oh, Bernie!

19:00.581 --> 19:02.106
Hey, uh, can I sit here?

19:02.141 --> 19:04.383
It's a free country.

19:04.419 --> 19:05.499
Thanks to my generation.

19:08.130 --> 19:09.930
Hey...

19:09.966 --> 19:12.007
you look familiar. Have we met?

19:12.042 --> 19:15.153
Uh, no, I don't think so.

19:15.155 --> 19:17.637
I just started volunteering here.
I'm KC Cooper.

19:17.673 --> 19:19.865
I'm not telling you my name.
Identity theft.

19:19.900 --> 19:20.980
It's all over the news.

19:22.594 --> 19:23.718
Gotcha.

19:23.754 --> 19:25.688
Hi, KC.

19:25.723 --> 19:28.015
Oh, hey, Marisa.

19:28.050 --> 19:29.425
Hey, take a look
at that hunka-hunka.

19:29.460 --> 19:32.745
That is my best friend Marisa
and her great unkle, Wally.

19:32.780 --> 19:34.460
He's single
and you look ready to mingle.

19:36.233 --> 19:39.418
Oh, please. I am over men.

19:39.453 --> 19:41.670
The last guy I was into
really burned me.

19:44.600 --> 19:48.811
Well, hey, it's never too late to
grab life by the snickerdoodles.

19:48.813 --> 19:50.663
You've got to live. Come on.
The time is now!

19:50.698 --> 19:54.116
You know,
that is very good advice.

19:54.151 --> 19:56.084
You're an old soul.

19:56.120 --> 19:59.313
Well, let's just say I had a friend
who taught me a lot about life.

20:01.592 --> 20:02.592
Go on.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.949
Hey! Back off, Etta, he's mine!

20:12.820 --> 20:14.653
Hi, I'm Irma.

20:14.688 --> 20:18.090
( Both giggle )

20:18.125 --> 20:18.999
( swing music playing )

20:19.034 --> 20:21.243
Oh!

20:21.279 --> 20:23.028
Oh, yeah! I love this song.
Let's dance.

20:23.063 --> 20:24.329
What? You want to dance?

20:24.365 --> 20:28.024
Oh, yeah. Come on. We're
young and alive, aren't we?

20:28.060 --> 20:29.835
But... Wha... What are you doing?

20:29.870 --> 20:31.720
I'm dancing
like no one's watching.

20:35.176 --> 20:37.568
Actually, uh,

20:37.570 --> 20:39.895
everybody's watching
and I'm very uncomfortable.

21:00.735 --> 21:02.801
WOMAN: <i>Rob, your name's on TV!</i>
