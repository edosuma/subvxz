WEBVTT

00:01.461 --> 00:03.828
It's the new drug called "gray."

00:03.862 --> 00:05.630
Two people OD'd on it last week.

00:05.664 --> 00:06.764
You know who's moving it?

00:06.798 --> 00:08.566
No. Still working on it.

00:08.600 --> 00:10.134
Sienna, I need something real

00:10.168 --> 00:11.769
or I have to file that
coke possession charge.

00:11.803 --> 00:13.905
I keep telling you it wasn't mine.

00:13.941 --> 00:15.811
- This guy paid me to...
- Yeah, I believe you.

00:15.836 --> 00:17.236
Which is why I gave you
a month to work it off.

00:17.276 --> 00:18.423
So far, nothing.

00:18.448 --> 00:19.745
Now you only have three days left.

00:19.793 --> 00:22.161
Wait, wait, wait,
I've got something else.

00:22.195 --> 00:25.765
My friend, Isabel... she works
at the club with me sometimes.

00:25.917 --> 00:27.818
Anyway, she has this new boyfriend.

00:27.852 --> 00:29.586
He hits her.

00:29.621 --> 00:32.823
That's horrible, but we
don't do domestic abuse cases.

00:33.348 --> 00:36.458
Um, how about murder?

00:37.419 --> 00:38.896
What?

00:38.930 --> 00:40.964
She said her boyfriend killed someone.

00:40.999 --> 00:43.834
An old girlfriend, he beat her to death.

00:43.868 --> 00:46.436
That's why I'm so scared for Isabel.

00:50.775 --> 00:53.410
Did Isabel say anything else... a name?

00:53.444 --> 00:57.481
She just said her boyfriend
dumped the body near a factory.

00:57.515 --> 01:00.684
- Wyatt, I think.
- Who's the boyfriend?

01:00.718 --> 01:02.085
She calls him D.

01:02.120 --> 01:03.620
I didn't push for details.

01:03.655 --> 01:05.588
Look, I've got enough drama of my own.

01:05.613 --> 01:06.982
When's the last time you
talked to Isabel?

01:07.042 --> 01:08.792
Three weeks ago.

01:08.826 --> 01:12.829
I've been texting her,
but she's not answering.

01:12.864 --> 01:15.032
And I don't know where she lives.

01:15.172 --> 01:17.053
You're using again, I can see it.

01:17.078 --> 01:19.050
- No, that's not true, I swear.
- You have three days

01:19.084 --> 01:22.286
to find me something real
or I file those charges.

01:29.027 --> 01:32.096
- She have anything good?
- No.

01:32.130 --> 01:35.232
I mean, some B.S.
about her friend's boyfriend

01:35.267 --> 01:39.136
killing someone, dumping the
body behind the Wyatt factory.

01:39.171 --> 01:40.671
She's just trying to buy more time

01:40.706 --> 01:42.573
because her month's almost up.

01:42.607 --> 01:43.941
She looked pretty upset.

01:43.975 --> 01:47.078
- Yeah, she's a good actor.
- Maybe.

01:47.112 --> 01:49.246
It might still be worth
calling in though.

01:49.281 --> 01:50.281
No.

01:50.315 --> 01:51.749
Does that mean you're not going

01:51.783 --> 01:53.184
to give her any more time?

01:53.218 --> 01:54.752
Well, you're not
supposed to extend deals

01:54.786 --> 01:56.454
according to the book, so.

01:56.488 --> 01:57.922
This is my first C.I.

01:57.956 --> 02:00.257
Yeah, the book's not always right.

02:00.292 --> 02:02.760
Sometimes you got to trust your gut.

02:10.869 --> 02:12.937
So Woods bought the money gag.

02:12.971 --> 02:14.472
Thinks I'm on his side again.

02:14.506 --> 02:16.107
- All right, good.
- Okay, so what's next?

02:16.141 --> 02:17.942
When do we take him down?

02:17.976 --> 02:19.610
We find his biggest weakness.

02:19.644 --> 02:21.011
Booze, women, gambling.

02:21.046 --> 02:23.614
I've already found it, boss. It's you.

02:23.648 --> 02:25.483
Hmm.

02:25.517 --> 02:27.318
Thanks, Adam.

02:27.352 --> 02:28.986
Yeah.

02:33.825 --> 02:35.626
Still not convinced, huh?

02:35.660 --> 02:40.297
No, I believe him.
Doesn't mean I forgive him.

02:40.332 --> 02:41.866
Hmm.

02:41.900 --> 02:45.302
- Sarge, you got a minute?
- Uh-huh.

02:47.130 --> 02:48.811
Um...

02:49.541 --> 02:53.144
I just wanted to apologize
for what happened with Camilla.

02:53.178 --> 02:55.479
I put the team in a bad situation.

02:55.514 --> 02:58.215
A really bad situation,
and it won't happen again.

02:58.250 --> 03:00.384
You have my word.

03:00.418 --> 03:03.420
Well, you're on desk duty
until further notice,

03:03.455 --> 03:06.557
and you've got an appointment
with the psychologist at 1:00.

03:11.062 --> 03:13.998
- Hey.
- Bless your heart.

03:14.032 --> 03:15.199
Double shot latte, three sugars.

03:15.233 --> 03:16.600
Have I told you

03:16.635 --> 03:18.836
you're my favorite member
of Intelligence?

03:18.870 --> 03:21.105
Never.

03:21.139 --> 03:23.107
- Hey.
- Hey, oh.

03:23.141 --> 03:25.242
- You. Mm-hmm.
- Thanks.

03:25.277 --> 03:27.678
Hey, so did you
make a decision on Sienna?

03:27.712 --> 03:30.948
Yeah. She doesn't deliver,
I'm going to file the charges.

03:30.982 --> 03:32.550
I gave her a chance and she blew it.

03:32.584 --> 03:34.919
Ooh, nice to see you toughen up.

03:34.953 --> 03:37.188
Don't let anyone take advantage.

03:37.222 --> 03:40.057
Detective Upton.

03:40.091 --> 03:43.260
Uh, yeah, I'll be there in 10 minutes.

03:43.295 --> 03:46.030
- We got to go.
- What? Where?

03:46.064 --> 03:48.065
- Homicide.
- Okay.

03:49.501 --> 03:52.403
Looks like she was beaten to death.

03:52.437 --> 03:54.371
It's pretty gruesome.

03:54.406 --> 03:56.440
Yeah. Hey, thanks for following up.

03:56.474 --> 03:58.809
- Nice work.
- It cost me 50 bucks.

03:58.844 --> 04:00.277
How's that?

04:00.312 --> 04:02.046
Gave Winters over here ten-to-one odds

04:02.080 --> 04:03.881
your snitch was talking crap.

04:03.915 --> 04:05.883
Her snitch.

04:05.917 --> 04:07.318
Hey, can you do me a favor

04:07.352 --> 04:08.953
and make the appropriate notifications?

04:08.987 --> 04:11.121
- Yeah.
- Thanks, guys.

04:14.092 --> 04:16.392
Like I said, it was just a hunch.

04:16.428 --> 04:19.563
Sienna's story was
a little too weird to be fake.

04:19.598 --> 04:22.433
- I'm sorry if I overstepped.
- You did.

04:24.035 --> 04:25.402
Well, at least now you know

04:25.437 --> 04:27.271
Sienna isn't playing you, right?

04:33.638 --> 04:37.340
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx
<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

04:37.525 --> 04:39.093
She's a Jane Doe.

04:39.143 --> 04:40.977
We ran her prints;
they're not in the system.

04:41.152 --> 04:42.653
And my CI doesn't know her name either,

04:42.687 --> 04:44.989
but her friend's name is Isabel Perez.

04:45.023 --> 04:46.290
And she's dating the same guy

04:46.324 --> 04:47.925
that looks good for this murder.

04:47.959 --> 04:48.993
What do we know about her?

04:49.027 --> 04:50.194
- Isabel?
- Yeah.

04:50.228 --> 04:51.929
Latina, 21, used to work

04:51.963 --> 04:53.430
on and off at a strip club
on the west side.

04:53.465 --> 04:55.132
A place called Alibi.

04:55.166 --> 04:58.035
Okay, so we think her
boyfriend killed the Jane Doe?

04:58.069 --> 04:59.603
Yeah, yeah, and maybe Isabel too.

04:59.638 --> 05:01.338
Because she's been missing three weeks,

05:01.373 --> 05:02.773
I tried tracking her phone. It's dead.

05:02.807 --> 05:04.308
All right, well,
talk to your C.I. again.

05:04.342 --> 05:05.809
See what you can find out.

05:05.844 --> 05:07.978
Meanwhile, let's dig into this Jane Doe.

05:08.013 --> 05:11.215
What's her name? What's her story?

05:11.249 --> 05:12.950
Let me know if you want me to jump in.

05:12.984 --> 05:14.952
No, we're good.

05:14.986 --> 05:16.387
Your appointment's in ten minutes.

05:16.421 --> 05:18.689
If I were you, I'd be on time.

05:21.860 --> 05:25.529
I'm Dr. Rebecca Sloan.

05:25.563 --> 05:28.515
Have you ever been in therapy before?

05:29.265 --> 05:32.169
Um, I talked to someone
a while back, yeah.

05:32.203 --> 05:36.000
- After a shooting.
- Right, it's mandatory.

05:36.582 --> 05:41.720
So, uh, so you ask me
questions, and I talk, right?

05:41.746 --> 05:43.347
This is your time.

05:43.381 --> 05:46.183
If you have something
you want to talk about,

05:46.217 --> 05:48.819
I'll listen.

05:48.853 --> 05:51.789
And if I don't?

05:57.095 --> 05:59.496
C.O.D. was blunt force trauma.

05:59.531 --> 06:03.100
She was beaten repeatedly
with a long object,

06:03.134 --> 06:04.501
like a pipe or a tire iron.

06:04.536 --> 06:06.170
You can tell by the parallel tracks.

06:06.204 --> 06:07.404
When'd she die?

06:07.439 --> 06:10.040
Based on decomp, about a month ago.

06:10.075 --> 06:11.508
Find any evidence on her body?

06:11.543 --> 06:13.177
I'm running semen samples now.

06:13.211 --> 06:15.245
- Sexual assault?
- Hard to say.

06:15.280 --> 06:16.847
No tearing of tissues.

06:16.881 --> 06:18.882
Any offensive or defensive wounds?

06:18.917 --> 06:21.285
No, doesn't look like
there was much of a struggle.

06:21.319 --> 06:22.686
Probably knew her killer.

06:22.721 --> 06:23.954
That syncs up with the C.I. story,

06:23.989 --> 06:25.422
boyfriend killed girlfriend.

06:25.457 --> 06:27.691
There's one other thing
worth pointing out.

06:27.726 --> 06:30.627
She's had lots of cosmetic procedures.

06:30.662 --> 06:33.697
Injections into
the breasts, buttocks, lips.

06:33.732 --> 06:35.532
All right, we'll get a list
of nearby plastic surgeons.

06:35.567 --> 06:37.434
Probably a waste of time.

06:37.469 --> 06:40.571
It appears she was injected
with motor oil.

06:45.010 --> 06:47.945
So this guy Isabel is with
really killed somebody?

06:47.979 --> 06:49.380
- Damn.
- Looks that way.

06:49.414 --> 06:51.382
We found the body
behind the Wyatt factory,

06:51.416 --> 06:52.583
just like Isabel said.

06:52.617 --> 06:54.651
I'm glad I told you about it.

06:54.686 --> 06:57.388
I wasn't sure, you know, Izzy,
she says a lot of wacky things.

06:57.422 --> 07:00.624
But this was crazy, even for her.

07:00.658 --> 07:02.826
I can't have no felony on my record.

07:02.861 --> 07:05.562
I'll never get a good job
at a restaurant.

07:05.597 --> 07:07.564
I'm training to be a chef.

07:07.599 --> 07:09.500
That's great. So just stay focused.

07:09.534 --> 07:11.502
Do what I need you to do,
and you'll be fine.

07:11.536 --> 07:12.970
Let's start at the beginning, okay?

07:13.004 --> 07:15.739
Where was Isabel living
before she met D?

07:15.774 --> 07:18.609
A shelter. Like a charity thing.

07:18.643 --> 07:21.779
You know, beds, counselors, food.

07:21.813 --> 07:24.915
Izzy was always trying
to get her life right.

07:24.949 --> 07:26.583
She just never could.

07:26.618 --> 07:28.485
What's it called?

07:30.655 --> 07:33.290
No, she doesn't look familiar.

07:33.324 --> 07:34.992
But we talk to over
a hundred women a month.

07:35.026 --> 07:36.660
Many of them are timid,

07:36.694 --> 07:39.263
or so scared they won't even
tell us their real names.

07:39.297 --> 07:43.000
But we let them in nonetheless.

07:43.034 --> 07:44.635
What's this about?

07:44.669 --> 07:46.670
She was reported missing.

07:46.704 --> 07:48.839
Can we look through some of your files?

07:48.873 --> 07:51.508
Yeah, of course.
Yeah, I can help with that.

07:51.543 --> 07:54.011
Great. Thanks, Juan.

07:56.915 --> 07:59.450
Okay, you're right.

07:59.484 --> 08:01.018
Isabel Perez, here she is.

08:01.052 --> 08:02.786
Turns out she's been here several times.

08:02.821 --> 08:05.222
Well, when was
the last time she was here?

08:05.256 --> 08:06.957
Uh, two months ago.

08:06.991 --> 08:08.358
All right, Amanda was her counselor.

08:08.393 --> 08:10.127
Amanda.

08:10.161 --> 08:13.230
The police are asking about
someone named Isabel Perez.

08:13.264 --> 08:14.865
Why, did something happen to her?

08:14.899 --> 08:16.200
We're not sure.

08:16.234 --> 08:17.634
We just want to ask a few questions.

08:17.669 --> 08:19.336
Sure. Truth is, I'm glad you're here.

08:19.370 --> 08:20.804
I've been worried about her.

08:20.839 --> 08:22.473
I've been calling and texting her...

08:22.507 --> 08:23.974
When was the last time
you heard from her?

08:24.008 --> 08:25.909
About three weeks ago.

08:25.944 --> 08:29.847
Did she say anything unusual?
Did she seem sad, happy, upset?

08:29.881 --> 08:31.315
More like excited.

08:31.349 --> 08:33.517
She was on her way
to get cosmetic surgery.

08:33.551 --> 08:36.820
An injection in her buttocks, I think.

08:36.855 --> 08:40.157
Made me sad. She's so young and pretty,

08:40.191 --> 08:42.860
but her boyfriend
really wanted her to do it

08:42.894 --> 08:44.895
and she wants to make him happy.

08:44.929 --> 08:47.831
Did Isabel tell you
the name of her boyfriend?

08:47.866 --> 08:50.234
What about the doctor, or the clinic?

08:50.268 --> 08:51.668
No, sorry.

08:51.703 --> 08:53.237
Okay, well, if you hear from her,

08:53.271 --> 08:54.438
you call me.

08:54.472 --> 08:55.672
Absolutely, and please call

08:55.707 --> 08:56.840
if you have any other questions.

08:56.875 --> 08:59.009
Yeah, thanks.

09:00.378 --> 09:02.045
Good to see you, Raul. What's up?

09:02.080 --> 09:03.747
Maria made cheese tamales.

09:03.781 --> 09:05.682
Oh, come on, don't tell me
they're against the rules.

09:05.717 --> 09:08.752
- I know you love them.
- I do, thank you.

09:08.786 --> 09:11.121
I wish I had something
to tell you, herma,

09:11.156 --> 09:13.590
but business has been soft.

09:13.625 --> 09:16.193
Haven't installed a drug
compartment in two months.

09:16.227 --> 09:18.028
I came to talk to you
about something else.

09:18.062 --> 09:19.930
There was a murder.
Young woman, twenties.

09:19.964 --> 09:23.700
Oh, a murder?
Hell no, that's not for me.

09:23.735 --> 09:25.469
Listen, I tell you
about hidden compartments

09:25.503 --> 09:27.871
in narco's cars. That's our deal.

09:27.906 --> 09:30.140
All right, I didn't come to
talk to you about the murder.

09:30.175 --> 09:32.042
I just wanted to know if you
know of any off-the-books

09:32.076 --> 09:33.810
medical clinics in Pilsen.

09:33.845 --> 09:36.480
Somewhere that women go to get
plastic surgery, injections.

09:36.514 --> 09:38.715
It's your hood, I figured
you might know something.

09:38.750 --> 09:41.385
Yeah, that's easy. Let me ask around.

09:41.419 --> 09:42.920
Okay, great. Thank you.

09:42.954 --> 09:44.821
- All right.
- Thank Maria for the tamales.

09:44.856 --> 09:46.056
I will.

09:51.629 --> 09:53.330
We got good news.

09:53.364 --> 09:55.399
We got a positive ID on the Jane Doe.

09:55.433 --> 09:57.100
She goes by the name of Sylvia Castro.

09:57.135 --> 09:59.803
We stopped by the strip club
that Isabel used to work at.

09:59.837 --> 10:01.505
It turns out Sylvia worked there too.

10:01.539 --> 10:03.106
Boss ID'd the crime scene photo,

10:03.141 --> 10:04.841
but he did not know anything
about a boyfriend.

10:04.876 --> 10:06.643
Okay, what else do we know?

10:06.678 --> 10:08.779
We know she's 19,
originally from Cleveland,

10:08.813 --> 10:10.314
and she's been missing from
work for about three months.

10:10.348 --> 10:11.582
All right, track down the family

10:11.616 --> 10:13.350
and let them know what happened.

10:13.384 --> 10:16.119
All right, talk to Sylvia's
friends, co-workers, roommates.

10:16.154 --> 10:18.822
Someone's got to know
who this boyfriend was.

10:21.192 --> 10:22.526
Are you sure this is it?

10:22.560 --> 10:24.094
It's the address Raul gave me.

10:24.128 --> 10:25.529
Doesn't look like a medical clinic.

10:25.563 --> 10:27.965
I think that's the point.

10:31.135 --> 10:32.502
Chicago PD!

10:32.537 --> 10:34.104
- Time to go, ma'am.
- Give me that.

10:34.138 --> 10:35.839
Don't come back.
This isn't a real doctor.

10:35.873 --> 10:37.841
No, no, I never said
I was a real doctor.

10:37.875 --> 10:39.710
I don't operate,
I don't do surgery, I just...

10:39.744 --> 10:41.278
You just inject women with motor oil.

10:41.312 --> 10:43.113
We're trying to find
one of your patients.

10:43.147 --> 10:44.715
Recognize her?

10:44.749 --> 10:47.784
Yeah. Isabella, I think
her last name is Perez.

10:47.819 --> 10:49.019
Okay, what about her boyfriend?

10:49.053 --> 10:50.120
Do you know his name?

10:50.154 --> 10:50.954
No.

10:53.157 --> 10:54.791
What about her, you recognize her?

10:54.826 --> 10:56.660
She was one of your patients.

10:56.694 --> 10:58.695
Her name was Sylvia Castro,
same boyfriend as Isabel.

10:58.730 --> 10:59.963
We want a name now.

10:59.998 --> 11:01.632
And given what's going on here,

11:01.666 --> 11:03.200
you're going to want to cooperate.

11:03.234 --> 11:05.235
Because you're going to need
all the help you can get.

11:11.042 --> 11:13.143
Hey, Sarge, just talked
to our DOA's sister.

11:13.177 --> 11:14.978
Right before she met
this mystery boyfriend,

11:15.013 --> 11:17.180
she was living in a shelter
called Jenny's Haven.

11:17.215 --> 11:18.582
Wait.

11:18.616 --> 11:20.984
- Did you say Jenny's Haven?
- Yeah.

11:21.019 --> 11:22.319
That's the same place Isabel stayed at.

11:22.353 --> 11:23.720
That's now two things

11:23.755 --> 11:25.656
Isabel and our DOA have in common.

11:25.690 --> 11:27.924
They both got plastic surgery
at the same underground clinic.

11:27.959 --> 11:30.193
Paid for by the same guy, Damien Soto.

11:30.228 --> 11:32.696
Yeah, I got him right here. Two priors.

11:32.730 --> 11:34.665
One for assault and battery,
one for pandering.

11:34.699 --> 11:35.999
Oh, so he's a pimp.

11:36.034 --> 11:37.768
We got a photo of this prick?

11:37.802 --> 11:39.670
All right, give me one sec.

11:40.905 --> 11:44.174
That's Juan. From Jenny's Haven.

11:44.208 --> 11:46.443
You're telling me this guy
works at the shelter?

11:46.477 --> 11:47.878
No, he's the founder.

11:47.912 --> 11:51.048
That's a fox guarding the henhouse.

11:51.082 --> 11:53.717
All right, grab this son of a bitch now.

11:56.421 --> 11:58.221
Chicago PD!

11:58.256 --> 12:00.023
Upton.

12:00.058 --> 12:01.692
Go forward.

12:01.726 --> 12:03.527
- Clear!
- I got the kitchen.

12:11.569 --> 12:13.070
Clear.

12:14.739 --> 12:16.373
Three empty beds.

12:16.407 --> 12:19.543
- Well, they left in a hurry.
- Yeah, who tipped them off?

12:19.577 --> 12:21.144
Looks like Isabel wasn't his only girl.

12:21.179 --> 12:23.780
You mean prisoner. He's locking them up.

12:23.815 --> 12:26.717
5021 Eddie, roll the crime lab
to 540 Water Street.

12:26.751 --> 12:28.285
We need a scene processed for prints.

12:28.319 --> 12:30.053
<i>Copy that, 5021 Eddie.</i>

12:30.088 --> 12:32.456
Burgess.

12:32.490 --> 12:34.825
I'll be there in 15.

12:34.859 --> 12:36.393
Hey, guys, we're going to break off.

12:36.427 --> 12:38.095
Yeah, copy that.

12:38.129 --> 12:40.831
So your friend saw Isabel
on Racine Avenue last night?

12:40.865 --> 12:42.666
Yeah, around midnight.

12:42.700 --> 12:44.468
- She was with some guy.
- Doing what?

12:44.502 --> 12:46.336
Don't know, but I'm guessing
looking for dope.

12:46.371 --> 12:48.438
She's got to have it, and
I've been trying to help her,

12:48.473 --> 12:49.439
- but...
- Well, at least you know

12:49.474 --> 12:50.674
she's still alive.

12:50.708 --> 12:52.409
- That's something, right?
- Right.

12:52.443 --> 12:55.112
Now we just need to get her
away from that awful boyfriend.

12:55.146 --> 12:57.914
Uh, you mean pimp.
His name is Damien Soto.

12:57.949 --> 13:00.617
He's got six other girls, too.

13:00.651 --> 13:02.352
Makes me sick.

13:02.387 --> 13:04.020
You said Isabel has a drug habit.

13:04.055 --> 13:06.022
That means she'll be looking
to score sometime soon.

13:06.057 --> 13:07.958
So why don't you ask around,
see who's selling to her.

13:07.992 --> 13:09.626
We'll track her down that way.

13:09.660 --> 13:13.029
Walk around Pilsen
talking to heroin dealers?

13:13.064 --> 13:14.197
Nah, I'm clean.

13:14.232 --> 13:15.932
I don't like hanging out in that area.

13:15.967 --> 13:19.169
Yeah, that's dangerous, no doubt.

13:19.203 --> 13:20.971
Sienna, we had a deal.

13:21.005 --> 13:22.205
I said if you help find the killer,

13:22.240 --> 13:23.673
I wouldn't file charges.

13:23.708 --> 13:26.042
So far, you haven't done much helping.

13:26.077 --> 13:28.311
Wow. That's pretty hardcore.

13:28.346 --> 13:30.180
Don't blow it.
You're taking cooking classes.

13:30.214 --> 13:31.648
You're working hard to be a chef.

13:31.682 --> 13:33.784
Real hard. And I'm good, too.

13:33.818 --> 13:35.819
It doesn't matter.
If you don't cooperate,

13:35.853 --> 13:38.855
the only place you'll
be cooking is Stateville.

13:45.096 --> 13:47.464
Okay, okay, I'll give it a shot.

13:47.498 --> 13:49.900
That's a good choice.

13:49.934 --> 13:51.635
Here's 500, grease the dealers.

13:51.669 --> 13:54.738
Tell them there's more cash
if they deliver a lead.

13:56.000 --> 14:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:04.582 --> 14:07.083
Look, I'm not going to tell
you how to do your job,

14:07.118 --> 14:10.353
but that was pretty hardcore.

14:10.388 --> 14:14.491
She's a C.I., Haley.
That's what she signed up for.

14:19.128 --> 14:20.962
So I figured I'd check out
the Latino papers,

14:20.987 --> 14:22.908
see if this pimp was advertising.
Look what I found.

14:23.743 --> 14:25.143
That is definitely Isabel.

14:25.221 --> 14:26.820
So call them, we'll go grab her up.

14:26.875 --> 14:28.086
I already did.
The phone's been disconnected.

14:28.111 --> 14:29.209
The website's down too.

14:29.244 --> 14:30.744
Oh, he's smart.

14:30.779 --> 14:33.414
Staying under the radar
until the heat dies down.

14:33.448 --> 14:35.015
I talked to three current residents

14:35.050 --> 14:37.184
and seven past residents
of Jenny's Haven.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.844
One of the girls was 16.

14:38.887 --> 14:41.120
Damien buys her jewelry,
takes her out to dinner.

14:41.182 --> 14:42.413
What he does is
he treats them like gold,

14:42.448 --> 14:43.972
then turns them out
to the highest bidder.

14:44.089 --> 14:45.473
Yeah, and if they get out of line,

14:45.498 --> 14:47.499
he just beats them to death
with a tire iron.

14:47.730 --> 14:49.226
The crime lab
pulled eight sets of prints

14:49.261 --> 14:50.328
from Damien's house,

14:50.362 --> 14:51.896
but the only match is to Damien.

14:51.930 --> 14:53.135
And we also managed

14:53.160 --> 14:54.744
to pick up Damien's vehicle information.

14:54.815 --> 14:56.482
All right, put out a BOLO right away.

14:56.517 --> 14:58.351
In the meantime, hit the streets.

14:58.393 --> 15:00.795
Get his picture out there.

15:03.424 --> 15:05.291
Damien Soto? Never heard of him.

15:05.325 --> 15:08.728
We think he runs a small
operation somewhere in Pilsen.

15:08.762 --> 15:10.963
I don't pay much attention
to the mom and pops.

15:10.998 --> 15:14.734
This guy isn't exactly warm and fuzzy.

15:14.768 --> 15:17.537
He killed one of his girls
with a tire iron.

15:19.173 --> 15:22.408
I wish I could help, Hank.
But I don't run in that crowd.

15:22.443 --> 15:23.819
- You know that.
- Mm-hmm.

15:23.844 --> 15:26.245
My girls are high-end, educated.

15:26.280 --> 15:28.381
They do what they do
because they want to.

15:28.415 --> 15:29.982
Patricia, I'm not here to judge.

15:30.017 --> 15:33.152
I'm just trying to get some help.

15:33.187 --> 15:35.488
I know, sorry.

15:35.522 --> 15:37.156
So let me ask.

15:37.191 --> 15:38.825
Okay, a guy like that.

15:38.859 --> 15:42.228
You know, a pimp on the lam
afraid to work his girls.

15:42.262 --> 15:44.163
How does he make his money?

15:44.198 --> 15:46.399
Well, he can't pimp them,
he'll sell them.

15:46.433 --> 15:49.736
It's cold-blooded,
but that's how these guys roll.

15:54.141 --> 15:55.508
Thanks.

15:55.542 --> 15:58.177
- And by the way.
- Hm?

15:58.212 --> 16:00.713
How do you like Nicole?

16:00.748 --> 16:02.548
She's nice.

16:02.583 --> 16:04.117
She says you two just talk.

16:04.151 --> 16:07.186
Like it's a therapy session
or something.

16:13.994 --> 16:15.728
Please tell me you got a lead.

16:15.763 --> 16:17.029
Well, we've been going through

16:17.064 --> 16:18.531
all the surveillance footage we can,

16:18.565 --> 16:20.032
but we're still coming up empty, so.

16:20.067 --> 16:21.701
- Any luck with Damien's phone?
- No, sir.

16:21.735 --> 16:23.536
And no hit on the car, either.

16:23.570 --> 16:25.538
Right, well, he has got to
come up for air at some point,

16:25.572 --> 16:27.206
- so stay on it.
- You got it, boss.

16:27.241 --> 16:29.809
I've got patrol canvassing
the neighborhood 24/7.

16:29.843 --> 16:31.644
All right, thanks.
You get word from your C.I.?

16:31.678 --> 16:33.079
Yeah, I talked to her a few hours ago.

16:33.113 --> 16:34.547
She found a dealer

16:34.581 --> 16:36.315
who sold Isabel heroin two days ago.

16:36.350 --> 16:38.951
Said he'd text her again when
Isabel was looking to score.

16:38.986 --> 16:40.720
- Nice.
- Yeah.

16:43.323 --> 16:46.058
Burgess.

16:46.093 --> 16:47.927
What?

16:47.961 --> 16:49.896
When?

16:52.266 --> 16:54.734
Okay, thanks.

16:54.768 --> 16:56.602
Are you okay?

16:59.706 --> 17:03.576
It's just down here.
Shot twice in the chest.

17:03.610 --> 17:08.614
Found your number in her cell
on the recently called list.

17:10.450 --> 17:12.318
- Her name is...
- Sienna.

17:12.352 --> 17:16.622
I know, she's my informant.

17:26.233 --> 17:28.166
Patrol has found Sienna's
phone at the scene.

17:28.202 --> 17:30.036
She had a text message from
the drug dealer last night

17:30.070 --> 17:32.939
at 10:12, saying he was
meeting up with Isabel

17:32.973 --> 17:35.641
in the park,
same place we found the body.

17:35.676 --> 17:37.043
Could be a robbery?

17:37.077 --> 17:38.945
No, she had her wallet in her pocket.

17:38.979 --> 17:40.112
She had some cash in there, too.

17:40.147 --> 17:41.614
It was a setup.

17:41.648 --> 17:43.549
The dealer texted Damien,
Damien killed her.

17:43.584 --> 17:45.885
He didn't want anyone getting
in the way of his business.

17:45.919 --> 17:49.222
Okay, what do we know about this dealer?

17:49.256 --> 17:50.623
Eduardo Varela.

17:50.657 --> 17:52.124
Two priors, heroin distribution.

17:52.159 --> 17:54.794
We have his address, too.
134 Hoover Road.

17:54.828 --> 17:57.029
So pay Eduardo a visit.

17:57.064 --> 17:59.365
And squeeze him. I want answers.

17:59.399 --> 18:01.968
Yeah.

18:02.002 --> 18:04.804
- Hey, you all right?
- Yeah.

18:04.838 --> 18:07.373
Listen, I'm sorry about Sienna, but...

18:07.407 --> 18:10.009
You know, that's not on you.

18:12.713 --> 18:14.480
I think I pushed too hard.

18:14.514 --> 18:16.816
No, that's how it goes.

18:16.850 --> 18:18.484
You were doing your job, okay?

18:18.518 --> 18:21.821
You're either playing
or you're getting played.

18:21.855 --> 18:24.323
Okay, let's go talk
to this heroin dealer.

18:24.358 --> 18:25.825
All right?

18:30.597 --> 18:33.833
Chicago PD!

18:33.867 --> 18:36.002
- Hey, you Eduardo Varela?
- What's going on?

18:36.036 --> 18:37.336
Move your punk ass out the way!

18:37.371 --> 18:39.038
You have no right talking
to me like that.

18:39.072 --> 18:40.773
Hey, don't talk to me like that, Eddie,

18:40.807 --> 18:42.008
'cause I'm not in the mood.
Turn around, get your hands up.

18:42.042 --> 18:43.776
- Hands up!
- Ah

18:43.810 --> 18:45.411
- Hey, hey, hey.
- We're good.

18:45.445 --> 18:46.579
All right, sit down.

18:46.613 --> 18:47.680
- Hey.
- Have a seat.

18:47.714 --> 18:49.081
Where's Damien Soto?

18:49.116 --> 18:50.616
Don't know nobody with that name.

18:50.651 --> 18:52.084
Dude, we don't got time for that.

18:52.119 --> 18:53.686
We know you just got off
the phone with him

18:53.720 --> 18:55.354
right after you met with Sienna.

18:55.389 --> 18:57.023
And then you sent her a text,
and now she's dead.

18:57.057 --> 18:58.291
Somebody's got to answer
for that, Eddie.

18:58.325 --> 19:00.026
Look what we found.

19:00.060 --> 19:02.795
Oh, heroin, huh? I'm not surprised.

19:02.829 --> 19:04.196
You have two choices, Eduardo.

19:04.231 --> 19:05.898
One, we bust you for heroin possession

19:05.933 --> 19:07.366
and conspiracy to commit murder.

19:07.401 --> 19:09.302
Or two, you help us find Isabel Perez.

19:09.336 --> 19:12.104
Or Damien Soto's bitch ass.
It's up to you.

19:12.139 --> 19:14.907
Okay, okay. I know who he is.

19:14.942 --> 19:16.542
And I know Izzy, but I didn't
help get no one killed.

19:16.576 --> 19:18.044
That's not what I'm about.

19:18.078 --> 19:19.545
Right, because you teach Sunday school.

19:19.579 --> 19:20.913
Damien told me to send that text

19:20.948 --> 19:22.882
so Isabel could talk to her friend.

19:22.916 --> 19:25.217
Tell us where Damien Soto is.

19:25.252 --> 19:28.054
I don't know.

19:28.088 --> 19:31.257
But I do know that Izzy's
coming over in a few hours

19:31.291 --> 19:32.925
to score some product.

19:32.960 --> 19:34.593
All right, that wasn't
that hard, was it, Eddie?

19:34.628 --> 19:36.729
Now, you're going to pretend
like everything's normal

19:36.763 --> 19:38.731
and let us do our job.

19:38.765 --> 19:41.334
Okay. What happens after that?

19:41.368 --> 19:43.970
You work for me as
an informant or you go to jail.

19:53.380 --> 19:56.182
Antonio, man... now I know why
he's got so many C.I.'s.

19:56.216 --> 19:58.918
He sees the opportunity,
he just makes the ask.

19:58.952 --> 20:00.786
Right? I mean, we were all there.

20:00.821 --> 20:04.256
I feel like Eduardo should be
a group C.I. or something.

20:04.291 --> 20:05.858
I mean, I don't understand
how Antonio gets dibs.

20:05.892 --> 20:07.593
Because he asked.

20:07.627 --> 20:10.162
Hey, look out.

20:10.197 --> 20:12.264
The target has just arrived.

20:12.299 --> 20:15.134
It's an unknown driver.
We can't really tell.

20:17.304 --> 20:19.839
We'll take Isabel, you take the driver.

20:19.873 --> 20:21.307
<i>Copy that.</i>

20:27.981 --> 20:31.450
Um, I only have $40 bucks. But I...

20:31.485 --> 20:33.219
No, no, no, no, no.

20:33.253 --> 20:35.654
Hey, hey, it's okay, it's
okay, you're not in trouble.

20:35.689 --> 20:36.856
We're here to help.

20:47.734 --> 20:49.135
Get out the vehicle.

20:49.169 --> 20:50.970
Put your hands where I can see them.

20:51.004 --> 20:53.739
Turn off the car. Turn off the car now!

20:53.774 --> 20:56.375
Hey! Do not move. Do not move.

20:57.611 --> 21:01.013
- Damn!
- Son of a bitch!

21:01.048 --> 21:03.482
Go, go, go, go, go!

21:14.261 --> 21:17.730
Hey, listen.

21:18.694 --> 21:20.532
Hey.

21:23.136 --> 21:25.500
Look, just to be clear...

21:26.352 --> 21:29.441
We don't want to press
charges against you, okay?

21:31.155 --> 21:32.978
Where are you living right now?

21:33.570 --> 21:37.015
In a house.
But I don't know where it is.

21:37.040 --> 21:38.483
I don't pay attention.

21:39.147 --> 21:42.390
Your boyfriend. This is Damien, hm?

21:45.287 --> 21:47.055
We need to talk to him.

21:47.282 --> 21:48.567
How come?

21:48.611 --> 21:51.914
We think he killed a young
woman named Sylvia Castro.

21:53.550 --> 21:56.929
And your friend, Sienna.

21:57.587 --> 21:59.000
What?

21:59.255 --> 22:00.898
Yeah.

22:02.249 --> 22:04.192
S-Sienna's dead?

22:04.937 --> 22:07.106
Died last night.

22:08.264 --> 22:10.365
Damien shot her in the chest twice.

22:10.400 --> 22:14.970
She was trying to find you.
She was trying to help you.

22:15.004 --> 22:19.741
Last night, did Damien
have blood on his clothes?

22:19.776 --> 22:22.845
Hands? Shoes?

22:24.013 --> 22:26.915
Isabel, the other girls
you live with are in danger.

22:26.950 --> 22:30.752
They need your help.

22:30.787 --> 22:35.023
Sorry, I don't remember anything.

22:40.296 --> 22:42.931
Give us a minute. Come on, Kim.

22:51.441 --> 22:53.642
We're not going to get
anything out of her tonight.

22:53.676 --> 22:57.179
I think we should just give her
something for her withdrawal,

22:57.213 --> 22:58.680
put her up in one of our safe houses,

22:58.715 --> 23:01.183
let her get some rest.

23:01.217 --> 23:03.118
We'll take another run at her tomorrow.

23:03.153 --> 23:04.653
Okay.

23:04.687 --> 23:06.989
Still haven't found
the driver or the car.

23:07.023 --> 23:08.290
I'm sorry, boss.

23:08.324 --> 23:09.791
He showed up earlier than we thought.

23:09.826 --> 23:11.493
Upton and Olinsky hadn't arrived yet,

23:11.528 --> 23:12.961
but we put the plates out
over the radio.

23:12.996 --> 23:14.163
Just waiting on a hit.

23:14.197 --> 23:15.964
Well, your night isn't over.

23:15.999 --> 23:19.301
I want you to go with Kim,
help get Isabel squared away.

23:19.335 --> 23:21.637
Copy that.

23:22.906 --> 23:26.775
All right, no one knows you're here.

23:26.809 --> 23:28.810
Don't open the door unless
you look through the peephole

23:28.845 --> 23:31.313
and you see a badge, all right?

23:31.347 --> 23:32.814
I brought you a change of clothes.

23:32.849 --> 23:34.850
You'll feel better after a shower.

23:34.884 --> 23:38.287
And, um, if you need anything,
you use this phone to call us.

23:38.321 --> 23:39.788
Oh, okay. Thank you.

23:39.822 --> 23:41.023
Yeah.

23:41.057 --> 23:43.158
So, um, will there be any police around?

23:43.193 --> 23:45.994
Yeah, there will be
a patrol car out front.

23:46.029 --> 23:48.130
Do you feel all right
in here by yourself?

23:48.164 --> 23:50.399
Yeah, I'm fine.

23:50.433 --> 23:54.069
- I-I feel safe.
- Good. You are.

23:54.103 --> 23:55.837
All right, you're all set.

23:55.872 --> 23:59.007
Listen, before we go,
I've got to ask you again.

23:59.042 --> 24:00.709
Where's Damien? Where's he staying?

24:00.743 --> 24:03.011
Adam, would you just stop?
Would you stop?

24:03.046 --> 24:06.381
Stop. She's not ready.

24:06.416 --> 24:09.885
You're okay. Get some rest, okay?

24:23.433 --> 24:25.100
Why is she protecting
that son of a bitch?

24:25.134 --> 24:26.902
I don't get it.

24:26.936 --> 24:28.570
Because she's in love with him.

24:28.605 --> 24:30.372
In love with him?

24:30.406 --> 24:33.208
- Yeah.
- That's not love.

24:33.243 --> 24:35.677
That's Stockholm Syndrome.

24:35.712 --> 24:37.746
Try telling her it's not love.

24:40.416 --> 24:42.951
Sometimes people...

24:42.986 --> 24:44.453
They trick themselves

24:44.487 --> 24:46.054
into believing
what they want to believe,

24:46.089 --> 24:49.725
because it feels better
than the alternative.

24:49.759 --> 24:52.894
Well, sometimes it's real.

24:52.929 --> 24:55.530
And there's no tricks or delusions.

24:55.565 --> 24:58.066
It's just good.

24:58.101 --> 25:01.470
It might be complicated,
but it's honest.

25:01.504 --> 25:04.573
Oh, come on.

25:04.607 --> 25:05.774
I don't know if leaving the phone

25:05.808 --> 25:07.409
was a really good idea, Kim.

25:07.443 --> 25:09.311
I just, I don't know if
she's going to take the bait.

25:09.345 --> 25:10.879
Whether she loves him or not,

25:10.913 --> 25:12.281
she's terrified of the guy.

25:12.315 --> 25:13.915
Hold on, she's making a call.

25:13.950 --> 25:15.784
<i>- Damien, it's me.
- Where are you, baby?</i>

25:15.818 --> 25:17.486
<i>I've been so worried about you.</i>

25:17.520 --> 25:19.755
<i>The police have me in a safe house.</i>

25:19.789 --> 25:22.591
<i>- Are they there?
- Um...</i>

25:22.625 --> 25:24.426
<i>No, they left.</i>

25:24.460 --> 25:25.827
<i>Okay, I'll come get you.
But just in case,</i>

25:25.862 --> 25:27.763
<i>meet me a few blocks away.</i>

25:27.797 --> 25:30.932
<i>Okay, meet me in the alley
between Irving and 15th.</i>

25:30.967 --> 25:32.634
<i>I'll be there in 20 minutes.</i>

25:32.669 --> 25:35.504
<i>- I love you, D.
- I love you too, baby.</i>

25:35.538 --> 25:37.272
Isabel just made contact
with Damien Soto.

25:37.307 --> 25:39.441
We have the number she dialed.
I'm calling it in now.

25:39.475 --> 25:41.943
I need someone to ping it, ASAP.

25:41.978 --> 25:45.781
Well, like I said, it was a good idea.

25:56.392 --> 26:00.022
That's a male Hispanic,
approaching from the east.

26:00.330 --> 26:02.631
- Let's go.
- Okay.

26:05.468 --> 26:08.136
- Oh, hey.
- Hey, you good?

26:08.171 --> 26:09.638
Yeah.

26:09.672 --> 26:11.006
Chicago PD!

26:11.040 --> 26:12.441
You set me up, you lying whore!

26:12.475 --> 26:13.842
No, no, don't shoot.

26:13.876 --> 26:15.310
- Drop your weapon!
- I didn't tell them!

26:15.345 --> 26:18.280
Drop your weapon!

26:18.314 --> 26:20.349
- Nice shot.
- No, no!

26:20.383 --> 26:22.117
I didn't know they were here.
I swear I didn't set you up.

26:22.151 --> 26:23.085
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

26:23.119 --> 26:25.821
What are you doing here?
Why did you shoot him?

26:25.855 --> 26:28.623
- Please don't die, I love you.
- 1521, Frank emergency.

26:28.658 --> 26:30.325
Shots fired by the police.
Offender down.

26:30.360 --> 26:32.994
- Stop hurting him, please...
- You're okay, just breathe.

26:33.029 --> 26:35.464
4200 West Irving, we're in the alley.

26:36.660 --> 26:38.567
Why would you do that?

26:38.601 --> 26:39.835
Copy that.

26:39.869 --> 26:43.672
- Just breathe.
- No.

26:47.790 --> 26:49.406
Damien took two to the shoulder.

26:49.491 --> 26:51.724
Yeah, he's in surgery right now.
He's going to live.

26:51.751 --> 26:53.452
All right, where's Isabel?

26:53.486 --> 26:55.562
Antonio took her to a clinic.
She's in bad shape.

26:55.587 --> 26:57.644
Between the withdrawals
and seeing Damien get shot,

26:57.669 --> 26:58.935
she's a mess.

26:58.960 --> 27:01.493
Okay, well, what about the phone call?
We got a location?

27:01.527 --> 27:03.085
Yeah, pinged off a cell tower
on the south side,

27:03.110 --> 27:04.251
near a bar named Vinnie's.

27:04.276 --> 27:06.048
The waitress there confirmed
he was there from 10 to 11.

27:06.095 --> 27:08.567
I dumped his phone, but I got nothing.

27:08.601 --> 27:10.836
Checked his car too,
no navigation system.

27:10.870 --> 27:14.206
So we still have no idea
where this bastard's living?

27:14.240 --> 27:15.674
Well, Pilsen isn't that big, guys.

27:15.708 --> 27:19.047
I want boots on the ground.
Circulate photos of Damien and Isabel.

27:19.072 --> 27:21.046
I mean, you've got C.I.'s in
the area, get on the phone.

27:21.080 --> 27:22.139
Call in a favor.

27:22.241 --> 27:25.944
We need to find these girls, soon.

27:28.881 --> 27:31.581
Hey, how you doing? How's therapy?

27:31.818 --> 27:34.486
Not really my thing.

27:35.740 --> 27:37.440
All right, well, if you're
not going to take it seriously

27:37.472 --> 27:39.958
or even attempt to take it
seriously, let me know.

27:39.992 --> 27:43.295
For real, because I need to
find a new partner.

27:48.367 --> 27:50.836
This guy, he owns a lot of houses.

27:51.064 --> 27:52.731
Rents them out to pimps, dealers.

27:52.772 --> 27:53.889
He gets a cut of the action.

27:53.967 --> 27:56.951
- You got this guy's name?
- I know of him.

27:58.336 --> 28:00.126
There's six girls out there.

28:00.160 --> 28:03.996
In trouble, locked up.
You'd be doing a good thing.

28:04.031 --> 28:05.898
I ain't in this to be no hero.

28:05.933 --> 28:08.367
I'm just saying,
this isn't our typical deal.

28:11.305 --> 28:13.906
All right, look,
I can get the guy's name.

28:13.941 --> 28:16.409
Problem is, my connect is a Latin Cobra.

28:16.443 --> 28:18.811
- So if you hit the house...
- You could get burnt.

28:18.845 --> 28:20.613
Or get dead.

28:23.984 --> 28:25.985
So you're saying Raul has a lead,

28:26.019 --> 28:27.753
but you told him not to chase it?

28:27.788 --> 28:29.422
Okay, think about it.

28:29.456 --> 28:32.091
Raul asks his Latin Cobra
connect for the address.

28:32.125 --> 28:33.659
And then we hit
the house five minutes later.

28:33.694 --> 28:34.994
It doesn't take a lot of math

28:35.028 --> 28:36.595
to figure out who our source is.

28:36.630 --> 28:38.331
So it's okay for my C.I.
to take on a risk,

28:38.365 --> 28:39.999
but not yours.
That's what you're saying?

28:40.033 --> 28:43.202
Kim, he has a wife and two kids.

28:43.236 --> 28:45.137
Not to mention I've known him
for over five years,

28:45.172 --> 28:46.839
and he's given me over 20 cases.

28:46.873 --> 28:49.275
- Mmm.
- And let's be clear.

28:49.309 --> 28:52.678
It was your choice
to push Sienna, not mine.

28:52.713 --> 28:55.514
I know, because there's
six girls out there,

28:55.549 --> 28:57.683
probably locked in some basement.

28:57.718 --> 28:59.986
And I'm not just going
to sit here and let them die.

29:00.020 --> 29:01.721
I want to find them as badly as you do,

29:01.755 --> 29:04.023
and I will do everything in
my power to make that happen.

29:04.057 --> 29:06.525
Yeah, everything but ask your informant.

29:06.560 --> 29:10.129
Raul's job, an informant's job,
is to provide information.

29:10.163 --> 29:12.164
He is an asset of
the Chicago Police Department.

29:12.199 --> 29:15.401
No, he is a person.

29:15.435 --> 29:18.471
And he is a friend.

29:34.888 --> 29:40.059
Damien, hey. Wake up, Chicago PD.

29:40.093 --> 29:42.328
I'm Sergeant Voight,
this is Detective Olinsky.

29:42.362 --> 29:44.063
We need to ask you some questions.

29:44.097 --> 29:46.065
Laywer.

29:46.099 --> 29:48.367
Hey, look at me.

29:48.402 --> 29:51.871
Trust me when I tell you,
this will go a lot easier

29:51.905 --> 29:53.906
if you cooperate.

29:53.940 --> 29:55.708
So where are you keeping the girls?

29:55.742 --> 29:59.045
- You think I'm stupid?
- Well, we already have Isabel.

29:59.079 --> 30:01.914
She loves me.

30:01.948 --> 30:04.116
More than you can possibly imagine.

30:04.151 --> 30:06.018
The second you get discharged from here,

30:06.053 --> 30:07.686
you're going to jail.

30:07.721 --> 30:11.357
And those girls, they're going
to find a new pimp.

30:11.391 --> 30:14.593
- Oh?
- When they do,

30:14.628 --> 30:17.797
they will give you up
for a slice of pizza.

30:17.831 --> 30:20.066
Well, good thing they're locked up.

30:20.100 --> 30:22.968
And one of them has diabetes, too.

30:23.003 --> 30:24.904
Needs insulin.

30:24.938 --> 30:30.476
Yeah, well, they die,
that just goes on your tab too.

30:30.510 --> 30:34.480
So do yourself a favor,
and tell us where they are

30:34.514 --> 30:38.184
while you still have
a chance to make a deal.

30:40.120 --> 30:44.156
All right, I'll tell
you where they are...

30:44.191 --> 30:46.392
When you offer me total immunity.

30:48.495 --> 30:53.699
Until then,
you can kiss my Colombian ass.

30:56.837 --> 31:00.773
Kiss his Colombian ass.

31:07.814 --> 31:11.517
A guy I know,
he had a real bad accident.

31:11.551 --> 31:15.955
A motorcycle accident. It was years ago.

31:15.989 --> 31:18.924
I mean, he was in a lot of pain.

31:18.959 --> 31:22.094
He ended up dying in the hospital.

31:22.129 --> 31:24.396
But it wasn't from his injuries.

31:26.199 --> 31:28.100
You know what ended up getting him?

31:28.135 --> 31:31.837
A morphine overdose.

31:34.374 --> 31:36.041
You know, they just figured somebody

31:36.076 --> 31:37.309
punched in the wrong numbers.

31:37.344 --> 31:39.445
Happens all the time.

31:39.479 --> 31:43.149
If... if... if I die, so do the girls.

31:43.183 --> 31:47.353
No, we'll just find them
a different way.

31:47.387 --> 31:50.322
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?

31:52.159 --> 31:54.593
Last chance, Damien.

31:57.831 --> 32:02.134
Like I said, kiss my ass.

32:06.273 --> 32:10.376
You see this face?
You get a good look at it.

32:12.679 --> 32:16.482
It's the last thing
you're ever going to see.

32:22.122 --> 32:23.189
Mr. Soto?

32:23.223 --> 32:25.624
- Hank.
- Excuse me.

32:27.027 --> 32:28.827
Hey, doc.

32:28.862 --> 32:31.597
He's all yours.

32:39.751 --> 32:42.024
Son of a bitch could care less
if these girls live or die.

32:42.111 --> 32:45.847
They're not girls to him.
They're assets.

32:46.202 --> 32:47.769
A guy like that,

32:47.821 --> 32:50.318
he doesn't let a money maker
die for no reason.

32:50.594 --> 32:52.161
Hey, excuse me.

32:52.234 --> 32:54.903
Damien Soto, is he one of your patients?

32:54.934 --> 32:56.434
Yes, why?

32:56.469 --> 32:58.637
I need you to do me a favor.

32:58.671 --> 33:01.800
I want you to leave
a cell phone in Damien's room.

33:01.839 --> 33:04.573
Just pretend you forgot it.

33:05.743 --> 33:07.878
<i>- Hello?
- It's me, Damien.</i>

33:07.912 --> 33:10.120
<i>Look, man, I'm in a situation,
like for real.</i>

33:10.145 --> 33:11.148
<i>I need some cash.</i>

33:11.195 --> 33:12.484
<i>So, what are you looking to do?</i>

33:12.539 --> 33:14.518
<i>- Sell some product.
- How many you got?</i>

33:14.552 --> 33:15.953
<i>Seven.</i>

33:15.987 --> 33:17.599
The other voice belongs to Cesar Ramos.

33:17.624 --> 33:19.559
He's another pimp working out of Pilsen.

33:19.584 --> 33:22.419
Track him down. And follow him.

33:38.509 --> 33:41.135
Ramos just stopped at
the possible target location.

33:41.160 --> 33:43.261
Get ready to move.

33:55.126 --> 33:57.894
Let's go.

34:01.228 --> 34:05.368
Cesar Ramos, Chicago PD. Turn around.

34:05.632 --> 34:08.266
Drop the bolt cutters. Drop them.

34:08.302 --> 34:11.771
Hands in the air, come down the stairs.

34:11.804 --> 34:14.340
That's it, come on.

34:17.643 --> 34:21.080
Why are you looking at me like that?

34:21.114 --> 34:23.081
Chicago PD!

34:25.819 --> 34:27.687
- Let me see your hands.
- It's okay, ladies.

34:27.721 --> 34:29.554
As long as we can see
your hands, you're all good.

34:29.589 --> 34:32.190
It's okay, we're the police.
We're here to help.

34:32.225 --> 34:34.927
Hold on, hold on, okay. Okay, go.

34:34.960 --> 34:36.195
I got the kitchen.

34:36.228 --> 34:37.763
- Is she okay?
- Upstairs!

34:37.797 --> 34:40.533
- You're good.
- Okay, you're good. Clear!

34:43.170 --> 34:45.804
Clear!

34:45.839 --> 34:48.474
Burgess.

34:48.507 --> 34:49.909
Clear!

34:51.844 --> 34:56.081
- Anything?
- She didn't make it.

34:56.116 --> 34:57.883
Oh, man.

34:57.918 --> 35:00.319
She must be the diabetic.

35:06.493 --> 35:08.794
I'll go check on the others.

35:21.942 --> 35:25.177
We found the other girls.

35:25.212 --> 35:27.947
One of them was dead.

35:27.981 --> 35:29.515
Because your friend Damien

35:29.549 --> 35:31.517
wouldn't tell us where they were.

35:31.551 --> 35:34.153
We need your help to convict him.

35:34.187 --> 35:35.855
Lydia.

35:35.889 --> 35:39.792
You know Lydia.
She's diabetic, needed insulin.

35:39.826 --> 35:42.328
But Damien didn't care
if she lived or died.

35:42.362 --> 35:44.363
He doesn't care
if any of you live or die.

35:44.398 --> 35:46.132
That's not true.

35:46.166 --> 35:49.535
You know what, actually she's right.

35:49.569 --> 35:53.706
You are right, he did care.
He cared a lot.

35:53.740 --> 35:58.577
He wanted you all to live
because he wanted to sell you.

36:03.316 --> 36:07.953
We recorded a call he made today.

36:07.988 --> 36:09.655
<i>It's me, Damien.</i>

36:09.689 --> 36:12.725
<i>Look, man, I'm in a situation,
like for real.</i>

36:12.759 --> 36:15.494
<i>- I need some cash, so.
- What are you looking to do?</i>

36:15.529 --> 36:17.363
<i>- Sell some product.
- How many you got?</i>

36:17.397 --> 36:18.864
<i>Seven.</i>

36:18.899 --> 36:22.668
<i>- How much?
- 90K, for all of them.</i>

36:24.271 --> 36:26.172
I can keep playing the tape if you want,

36:26.206 --> 36:28.307
but it's not pretty.

36:28.341 --> 36:30.376
Tell us what you know, Isabel.

36:45.792 --> 36:48.727
He doesn't love you, Isabel.

36:48.762 --> 36:51.697
He pretends he does
so he can control you.

36:54.468 --> 36:57.403
Look, I know you want to
believe in your relationship.

36:57.437 --> 37:01.173
You want to hold out hope.
We all do that.

37:01.208 --> 37:03.342
But I know that somewhere deep down,

37:03.376 --> 37:06.278
you know that that is a lie.

37:06.313 --> 37:09.081
I know because I've been there.

37:11.551 --> 37:13.853
I was in love with someone once,

37:13.887 --> 37:16.522
and they didn't really love me.

37:16.556 --> 37:19.024
<i>And I kept pretending, and I kept...</i>

37:19.059 --> 37:21.627
<i>Hoping.</i>

37:21.661 --> 37:23.729
And then eventually I just said enough.

37:23.763 --> 37:25.397
God, no more.

37:25.432 --> 37:27.366
And it hurt so much.

37:29.970 --> 37:33.539
But you know what?
Eventually, I felt better.

37:33.573 --> 37:37.142
Until one day, I felt whole again.

37:37.177 --> 37:40.412
And now the only thing that I regret

37:40.447 --> 37:42.615
is not doing that sooner.

37:44.951 --> 37:48.387
<i>It's time for you to say enough.</i>

37:53.493 --> 37:56.495
I know where Damien hid the tire iron

37:56.530 --> 38:00.266
that he used to kill Sylvia.

38:00.300 --> 38:01.934
You're good.

38:13.313 --> 38:17.616
It's okay. It's good.

38:26.326 --> 38:29.762
Nice job, Kim. You were amazing.

38:29.796 --> 38:32.331
We have enough
to charge Damien with murder,

38:32.365 --> 38:35.334
so not a bad result,
all things considered.

38:35.368 --> 38:38.203
I'm not so sure about that.

38:38.238 --> 38:40.940
Yeah, I know what you mean.

38:43.076 --> 38:45.210
- You do?
- Yeah.

38:45.245 --> 38:50.115
Look, I don't... I don't
regret protecting my C.I.

38:50.150 --> 38:52.184
Not for a second.

38:52.218 --> 38:54.954
But that girl dying, Lydia?

38:56.756 --> 39:00.626
I've got to live with that
for the rest of my life.

39:03.997 --> 39:07.299
It's hard to figure out
what we're supposed to do.

39:07.334 --> 39:12.304
Get the bad guys, save
the victims, protect our C.Is.

39:12.339 --> 39:14.239
I mean, if I didn't push Sienna,

39:14.274 --> 39:17.743
maybe we'd never find
Damien and the girls.

39:17.777 --> 39:20.613
But Sienna would still be alive.

39:22.882 --> 39:26.418
It's a hard needle to thread sometimes.

39:26.453 --> 39:28.988
More like impossible.

39:29.022 --> 39:32.024
You just got to trust your instincts.

39:32.058 --> 39:37.696
Right. Go with your gut, not the book.

39:37.731 --> 39:40.232
- That's right.
- Sweet.

39:44.471 --> 39:46.739
Hey, do you want to grab some dinner

39:46.773 --> 39:49.675
or something this weekend?

39:49.709 --> 39:53.445
Yeah, that sounds good.

39:53.480 --> 39:55.948
Okay, cool.

39:55.982 --> 39:58.817
Cool.

39:59.886 --> 40:03.722
Thanks for seeing me so last minute.

40:12.332 --> 40:15.668
Seems like you're ready to talk.

40:17.504 --> 40:20.673
Yeah, I am.

40:23.843 --> 40:25.911
So that story you told Isabel...

40:25.945 --> 40:29.815
- That wasn't you.
- Good.

40:29.849 --> 40:32.284
- I'm serious.
- Okay.

40:32.318 --> 40:34.653
Yeah, I believe you.
But just in case you're lying,

40:34.688 --> 40:36.889
- I would like you to know that...
- Adam, Adam, I was just trying

40:36.923 --> 40:39.925
to get a witness to flip,
simple as that.

40:39.959 --> 40:41.326
There's no need to go backwards, okay?

40:41.361 --> 40:43.162
I'm just... I'm not in the mood.

40:43.196 --> 40:46.598
Yeah, well, if you want,
we could head back to my place.

40:46.633 --> 40:47.966
Talk about going backwards.

40:48.001 --> 40:49.168
Maybe we can move things forward.

40:49.202 --> 40:50.569
No, we won't.

40:50.603 --> 40:52.571
Why not? Why not give it a shot?

40:52.605 --> 40:53.972
Because...

40:54.007 --> 40:55.908
I don't know, we work together.

40:55.942 --> 40:58.775
We're in totally different places.

40:59.212 --> 41:00.946
Okay.

41:07.220 --> 41:09.755
Having said that...

41:09.789 --> 41:12.591
I feel like having a little fun tonight.

41:19.566 --> 41:21.433
Let's get out of here.

41:21.468 --> 41:22.935
Okay.
