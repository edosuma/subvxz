00:00.100 --> 00:02.160
Previously on "Switched at Birth"...

00:02.180 --> 00:05.034
- I'm still really angry at you.
- That's fine.

00:05.484 --> 00:07.496
You must go to school with Travis.

00:07.516 --> 00:10.122
- Yeah, I go to Carlton.
- You talk!

00:10.142 --> 00:11.658

00:11.678 --> 00:13.783

00:16.977 --> 00:20.312
Wes: Two punks and this is the only frame
that shows any identifying features.

00:20.332 --> 00:23.073
It's from the entrance where they broke in,
but there's nothing from the site.

00:23.290 --> 00:27.148
How could you know and not tell me...
unless you were with him.

00:27.168 --> 00:30.186
She cost me hundreds of
thousands of dollars.

00:30.206 --> 00:33.490
- This is your project, too!
- I know.

00:33.510 --> 00:36.328
Wes, if our partnership means
anything to you,

00:36.348 --> 00:39.063
do not turn her in.

00:41.590 --> 00:43.975
You should go to USC,

00:43.995 --> 00:46.911
and I should come with you.

00:51.704 --> 00:53.561
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:53.581 --> 00:56.273
So I have been giving a lot of thought

00:56.293 --> 00:59.039
to what I want to do after graduation.

00:59.209 --> 01:00.896
I want to move to L.A. with Emmett.

01:00.916 --> 01:02.798
Move to California?

01:02.832 --> 01:05.768
Uh, let me see. That would be a "no."

01:05.802 --> 01:08.837
I'm trying to have an adult
discussion about this.

01:08.872 --> 01:12.775
Following your boyfriend across the country
like a puppy dog is not an adult move.

01:12.809 --> 01:15.644
- Dad!
- Emmett is gonna be busy with school.

01:15.678 --> 01:18.639
- What will you be doing?
- I'm not sure yet,

01:18.659 --> 01:21.290
- but I'll probably hang with Emmett...
- In his dorm.

01:21.310 --> 01:24.620
Just until I get the lay of the land,
and I'll get a job right away.

01:24.654 --> 01:28.224
And I've already started looking
at art schools. I'll figure it out.

01:28.244 --> 01:30.592
I think it's pretty clear that
you haven't figured it out.

01:30.627 --> 01:32.050
Yes, I have.

01:32.070 --> 01:34.785
Really? So what about your airplane ticket?

01:34.805 --> 01:37.974
And where are you gonna live after
Emmett's R.A. kicks you out of his dorm?

01:37.994 --> 01:40.202
And what about a car to get
around that big old town in?

01:40.236 --> 01:43.907
And how in God's name are
you going to pay for it all?

01:43.927 --> 01:45.407
Well,
I don't know what you guys were planning

01:45.442 --> 01:47.176
on doing for my graduation gift.

01:47.210 --> 01:48.786
Don't even finish that sentence.

01:48.806 --> 01:50.112
For us to even consider this,

01:50.146 --> 01:53.042
you have to come up with
a very realistic plan.

01:53.062 --> 01:56.405
So you're saying if I come
up with a realistic plan,

01:56.425 --> 01:59.188
- I can go?
- Sure.

01:59.798 --> 02:01.498
- Fine.
- Fine.

02:03.596 --> 02:05.805
_

02:09.900 --> 02:12.456
Okay, remember,
everyone has to sign for their yearbook,

02:12.476 --> 02:16.018
and you don't get yours if you
still have textbooks to turn in.

02:16.038 --> 02:19.393
I think, like, 0% of this class is
paying attention to you right now.

02:19.413 --> 02:20.876
Yeah, it's seniors on their last day.

02:20.910 --> 02:23.933
I might as well be herding cats.
There we go.

02:23.953 --> 02:25.182

You're back.

03:30.613 --> 03:33.615
Hi. How was Hawaii?

03:33.649 --> 03:35.043
The Mahi Mahi, the Mai Tais,

03:35.063 --> 03:36.308
the view from the balcony,

03:36.328 --> 03:37.959
it was all fantastic.

03:37.979 --> 03:39.882
Business wasn't bad either.

03:40.180 --> 03:42.208
I can't wait to hear all about it.

03:42.228 --> 03:43.425
Yes, you can.

03:43.459 --> 03:44.626
Excuse me.

03:44.660 --> 03:47.095
Well, I can smell polite shop talk
from a mile away.

03:47.115 --> 03:48.797
What you really want to know is

03:48.831 --> 03:50.731
what I'm gonna do about Daphne.

03:52.802 --> 03:54.703
I've been worried sick.

03:54.737 --> 03:58.673
Look,
I'm sorry I got so upset before I left.

03:58.999 --> 04:02.006
But being away was good,
allowed me to clear my head

04:02.026 --> 04:03.345
and think about things.

04:03.379 --> 04:04.679
And?

04:05.814 --> 04:07.712
No one will ever know she was involved.

04:07.732 --> 04:09.338
(Sighs)

04:09.996 --> 04:13.288
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

04:15.543 --> 04:17.743
I love Hawaii Wes.

04:29.733 --> 04:31.296
Wait.

04:31.569 --> 04:33.508
I... I can't.

04:36.533 --> 04:39.627
- I'm sorry.
- It's just...

04:40.247 --> 04:41.483
too soon.

04:41.517 --> 04:43.623
Right, of course.

04:44.665 --> 04:46.055
Wait.

04:46.911 --> 04:47.722
That wasn't...

04:47.757 --> 04:51.155
you don't think that because you're
doing something for Daphne that I...

04:51.175 --> 04:53.310
What? No! No, God. No.

04:53.330 --> 04:56.126
- This wasn't some kind of...
- Good.

04:56.732 --> 05:00.136
I'm sorry. I just wanna keep this...

05:00.156 --> 05:02.537
Professional. Right, right.

05:02.750 --> 05:04.239
I got it.

05:04.698 --> 05:06.262
Professional.

05:09.336 --> 05:11.963
Hey, those are so cool.

05:11.983 --> 05:15.140

05:15.425 --> 05:17.540

05:17.560 --> 05:20.513
Graduation? Hell, yeah.

05:20.533 --> 05:23.851
_

05:25.948 --> 05:29.051
Do you have anyone else coming tomorrow?

05:29.187 --> 05:31.148
_

05:31.701 --> 05:34.633
Did you invite any of your family?

05:35.477 --> 05:37.281
_

05:37.301 --> 05:38.773
Not even your mom?

05:38.926 --> 05:41.128
_

05:41.148 --> 05:43.003
Because she's your mom.

05:43.023 --> 05:46.006
And you only graduate
from high school once.

05:46.026 --> 05:49.498
_

05:50.610 --> 05:52.124
Okay.

07:28.695 --> 07:30.099
My dad wasn't kidding.

07:30.119 --> 07:33.465
Apartments in L.A. are expensive.

07:33.925 --> 07:37.437
I found this small artist's loft.
It's near downtown.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.943
It's ten minutes from USC.

07:39.963 --> 07:41.896
They need first and last,

07:41.931 --> 07:43.598
plus a security deposit.

07:43.632 --> 07:46.091
That and my airfare,

07:46.111 --> 07:48.761
it's almost $5,000.

07:49.431 --> 07:50.839
I'm going to need a job right away.

07:50.873 --> 07:54.189
Oh! Maybe we could drive
the thing out there

07:54.209 --> 07:56.167
to save on a plane ticket.

07:56.187 --> 07:59.815
_

07:59.835 --> 08:02.752
_

08:10.242 --> 08:14.387
_

08:15.256 --> 08:17.332
No, we're gonna make this work.

08:17.366 --> 08:20.480
We just need to figure it out, that's all.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.180
You and I are gonna be together.

08:25.265 --> 08:26.864
I love Wes.

08:26.884 --> 08:29.944
He said that you will not
be implicated in any way.

08:29.979 --> 08:31.029
Thank you so much.

08:31.049 --> 08:34.883
I know it must have been hard for you
to ask him for this.

08:34.917 --> 08:38.568
Now look, we really dodged a bullet here.

08:38.589 --> 08:39.921
You have to promise me...

08:39.955 --> 08:42.789
That nothing like this
will ever happen again.

08:42.825 --> 08:44.298
You have my word.

08:47.252 --> 08:49.262
Come on, let's go tell John and Kathryn.

08:49.282 --> 08:52.238
They've been so worried since I told them
about what I did.

08:52.258 --> 08:53.789
- Let's go.
- Yes.

08:58.614 --> 09:00.375
- (Laughs)
- (Sighs)

09:01.977 --> 09:06.047
- What's going on?
- This is Detective Markham.

09:06.345 --> 09:07.735
Is something wrong?

09:07.755 --> 09:10.084
She's here to arrest you.

09:13.820 --> 09:17.143
John: Okay, so what exactly
kind of trouble are we in here?

09:17.887 --> 09:19.262
I don't have all the details yet,

09:19.282 --> 09:22.265
but they have physical evidence placing
Daphne at the scene of the crime.

09:22.285 --> 09:24.328
- How did they find out?
- I don't know yet.

09:24.348 --> 09:26.536
I'll be getting all that information
as a matter of discovery,

09:26.556 --> 09:29.582
but the big issue here is that
Daphne is still under probation,

09:29.617 --> 09:31.497
which means that if she's convicted of
these charges,

09:31.517 --> 09:34.354
- it constitutes a second strike.
- No, no, no, wait a second.

09:34.388 --> 09:38.251
Okay, she was under 18
when the first strike happened...

09:38.271 --> 09:40.596
I thought you said Wes worked this out.
What happened?

09:40.616 --> 09:42.468
Honestly, I don't know.

09:42.488 --> 09:45.831
That plus the probation violation,

09:45.851 --> 09:47.967
Daphne will be looking at doing some time.

09:48.002 --> 09:50.782
- You mean prison?
- That can't happen.

09:50.802 --> 09:54.941
Normal sentencing guidelines would
dictate a three-year prison sentence.

09:54.975 --> 09:56.308
Three years?

09:56.328 --> 09:58.293
She'd never have to do the full three.

09:58.313 --> 10:01.296
- More likely a year and a half.
- (Gasps)

10:01.520 --> 10:03.808
- Oh, my God.
- No, absolutely not.

10:03.828 --> 10:07.213
What about this kid Nacho?
Where the hell is he in all of this?

10:07.233 --> 10:10.076
They have a warrant out for his arrest,
but presently they have no leads.

10:10.096 --> 10:11.937
Essentially he's vanished,

10:11.957 --> 10:14.494
but that's of little
relevance for Daphne's case.

10:14.528 --> 10:16.563
- Why not?
- Because the D.A. is more interested

10:16.597 --> 10:19.332
in a high-profile conviction
of a state senator's daughter.

10:19.366 --> 10:21.987
And they'll be looking for someone
to pay restitution for damages.

10:22.007 --> 10:24.717
And that someone is Daphne.

10:25.101 --> 10:27.440
- We're gonna fight this.
- We'll pay the damages.

10:27.474 --> 10:30.875
We're gonna go to trial.
We're gonna fight this all the way.

10:30.895 --> 10:33.803
Okay, that's an option,
and we'll assess the merits of a trial

10:33.823 --> 10:37.574
once I get the full discovery, but what you
have to remember is that if Daphne loses,

10:37.594 --> 10:40.577
and I firmly believe that
she could very well lose,

10:40.597 --> 10:43.741
she'd be looking at the
full three years in prison.

10:44.759 --> 10:46.603
I understand you're all upset right now,

10:46.623 --> 10:48.795
and there are no great
options on the table,

10:48.829 --> 10:51.497
but I have a solid
relationship with this D.A.,

10:51.517 --> 10:53.619
and I could get Daphne a plea deal.

10:53.639 --> 10:56.938
If you pay restitution
and plead no contest,

10:56.958 --> 10:58.174
I could get her six months.

10:58.194 --> 11:01.190
With good behavior,
she'd be back home in 90 days.

11:01.910 --> 11:03.788
Ninety days.

11:03.808 --> 11:05.464
Now, she'd still have a record.

11:05.484 --> 11:07.547
That is not going to work. I'm sorry.

11:07.581 --> 11:09.040
We're gonna get a different lawyer.

11:09.060 --> 11:11.751
I'm gonna do whatever it takes.

11:11.931 --> 11:14.240
That's certainly your prerogative,

11:14.438 --> 11:17.905
but what I want you all
to understand is this...

11:17.925 --> 11:20.050
no matter what you do,

11:20.070 --> 11:22.953
Daphne will do some time.

11:33.036 --> 11:35.096
So let me get this straight.

11:35.116 --> 11:37.789
Because I don't sleep with you,
you turn my daughter in?

11:37.809 --> 11:38.798
What are you talking about?

11:38.818 --> 11:41.280
I just finished bailing Daphne out of jail,

11:41.300 --> 11:43.420
and now they're bringing her up on charges.

11:43.440 --> 11:45.213
It looks like she's going to prison.

11:45.233 --> 11:46.185
Thank you!

11:46.220 --> 11:48.187
Well, I swear. I didn't do anything.

11:48.222 --> 11:52.200
Really? Because you are the only one
who knew about her involvement in this.

11:52.220 --> 11:54.321
Look,
anyone could have found out what happened.

11:54.341 --> 11:55.562
- Just because...
- Save it.

11:55.582 --> 11:59.203
You gave me your word,
and that meant something to me,

11:59.223 --> 12:01.077
but obviously I was an idiot,

12:01.097 --> 12:03.083
because you will always be the Wes Gable

12:03.103 --> 12:07.407
that puts yourself,
your money and your business first.

12:08.409 --> 12:09.833
Regina.

12:09.853 --> 12:11.511
(Sighs)

12:11.545 --> 12:13.142
(Knock on door)

12:15.516 --> 12:16.751
What took you so long?

12:16.771 --> 12:19.029
Tank's gonna be here in an hour, so...

12:19.049 --> 12:21.859
Can I get a rain check?
Being that I just got sacked,

12:21.879 --> 12:24.257
I'm not really in that kind of mood.

12:25.842 --> 12:27.160
Sure.

12:27.194 --> 12:30.424
Sorry, I wasn't thinking.

12:31.429 --> 12:35.405
So have you given any thought

12:35.425 --> 12:37.194
to what's next for you?

12:37.214 --> 12:40.842
Not really, but I like being back home.

12:41.450 --> 12:43.560
I think I'll try and make a go of it.

12:43.783 --> 12:46.737
That doesn't have anything to do with me,
right?

12:46.757 --> 12:47.770
I mean,

12:47.790 --> 12:51.448
do we need to talk about what this is?

12:51.468 --> 12:54.141
Like a state of the union?

12:54.161 --> 12:56.586
We fight and then we bonk.

12:56.606 --> 12:58.148
Not necessarily in that order.

12:58.168 --> 13:01.861
That is our union fully stated.

13:02.157 --> 13:05.189
I'm not staying here because of you.
I like it here.

13:05.209 --> 13:08.521
Good. You know, 'cause I just got out

13:08.541 --> 13:11.044
of this complicated marriage and...

13:11.064 --> 13:13.673
Toby, I like it just the way it is.

13:13.707 --> 13:16.252
Friends with the occasional bonking.

13:16.272 --> 13:18.444
The bonking is good.

13:18.479 --> 13:19.941
Yeah.

13:20.481 --> 13:22.615
Well, it's been a pretty crap day.

13:22.649 --> 13:24.682
So I think I'll push off.

13:26.453 --> 13:30.144
I'll see you tomorrow at graduation then,
as friends.

13:30.913 --> 13:32.564
See you there.

13:34.810 --> 13:37.843
So apparently the police were able

13:37.863 --> 13:41.402
to lift Daphne's fingerprints
from the damaged tractor.

13:41.422 --> 13:43.269
And because of her previous arrest,

13:43.303 --> 13:46.064
the fingerprints were on file.

13:46.473 --> 13:49.308
What's next then?

13:49.343 --> 13:50.532
We're gonna fight this, right?

13:50.552 --> 13:52.729
- Yeah.
- It wasn't even Daphne's idea.

13:52.749 --> 13:54.247
All she did was spray some paint.

13:54.281 --> 13:57.116
I know, but the lawyer doesn't
like our chances at trial.

13:57.151 --> 13:59.952
And the arraignment is scheduled
for the day after tomorrow,

13:59.987 --> 14:02.050
so she needs an answer soon.

14:05.289 --> 14:06.859
We've gotta do something.

14:06.894 --> 14:08.661
I can make more calls.
I can call in a favor.

14:08.695 --> 14:10.414
It's just one lawyer, get another.

14:10.434 --> 14:11.964
- Kathryn: We need to find a better lawyer.
- What are you talking about?

14:11.999 --> 14:14.248
Find another lawyer.
We can't just let her go to prison.

14:14.268 --> 14:16.936
- John: We have the best lawyer...
- Just stop.

14:17.897 --> 14:21.153
I appreciate everyone trying to help.
I really do.

14:21.173 --> 14:24.577
And maybe if I had listened to some
of you and not been so stubborn,

14:24.611 --> 14:26.746
we wouldn't all be here right now,

14:26.780 --> 14:29.565
but I can't change that now.

14:29.838 --> 14:32.345
I've made a decision.

14:32.881 --> 14:35.040
I'm gonna take the plea deal.

14:35.060 --> 14:37.490
This isn't like when you
blackmailed Chip Coto.

14:37.524 --> 14:39.459
You have a record. You'll go to prison.

14:39.493 --> 14:41.816
I need to face up to what I've done,

14:41.836 --> 14:43.785
whatever the consequences.

14:46.018 --> 14:48.810
I want us all to enjoy graduation,

14:48.830 --> 14:50.808
like we're supposed to.

14:52.111 --> 14:53.588
Can we do that?

14:57.177 --> 15:01.643
I just want one last day with you
guys before everything changes.

15:04.199 --> 15:05.885
Now if you'll excuse me,

15:05.919 --> 15:09.467
I have a graduation speech to finish.

15:25.164 --> 15:26.416
(Door opens)

15:26.436 --> 15:30.574
Hey, shouldn't you be getting
ready for your big day?

15:30.594 --> 15:32.679
I need to talk to you about something.

15:32.877 --> 15:33.907
Of course.

15:33.927 --> 15:37.672
Okay, I don't want to seem insensitive

15:37.692 --> 15:40.503
with everything that's
happening with Daphne right now.

15:40.523 --> 15:41.819
It's all right.

15:41.839 --> 15:45.249
We're not gonna ignore you.
What's going on?

15:45.269 --> 15:48.891
Emmett's going to USC in the fall,
and I want to go with him.

15:48.925 --> 15:50.959
And I asked my parents

15:50.994 --> 15:53.527
and my dad was really against it.

15:53.547 --> 15:56.071
I can see why he's concerned.

15:56.091 --> 15:58.033
L.A. is a long way away.

15:58.068 --> 16:02.340
That's what he said, but he also said
that if I put together a good plan,

16:02.360 --> 16:04.383
they'd be okay with me going.

16:04.544 --> 16:06.025
And did you?

16:06.045 --> 16:09.153
I lined up a job bussing
cafeteria tables at l.A.C.M.A.

16:09.173 --> 16:11.979
I found a safe, cheap apartment.

16:11.999 --> 16:15.094
Emmett is gonna sell his motorcycle
so we can buy a small car to share,

16:15.114 --> 16:17.886
and I even signed up for some
extension courses at Cal arts,

16:17.906 --> 16:20.969
which is this amazing art school.

16:22.048 --> 16:25.076
Sounds like you've done your homework.

16:25.957 --> 16:27.620
What's stopping you?

16:28.191 --> 16:30.157
I'm gonna need some money to get started.

16:30.177 --> 16:33.168
First and last month's rent
and some travel expenses.

16:33.203 --> 16:35.404
It's a little under $5,000.

16:35.438 --> 16:37.363
I was wondering if I could
use some of the money

16:37.383 --> 16:40.515
that Angelo left me to cover that.

16:46.289 --> 16:48.138
I'm proud of you.

16:49.714 --> 16:51.803
I think Angelo would be too.

16:51.823 --> 16:55.680
Is... is that a "yes?"

16:56.834 --> 16:58.216
It is.

16:58.236 --> 17:00.971
Thank you. Oh, thank you.

17:00.991 --> 17:02.898
Thank you for trusting me.

17:07.836 --> 17:09.570
Wow.

17:11.674 --> 17:14.390
- For you.
- What is this?

17:14.410 --> 17:17.232
My realistic plan.
My budget, travel expenses,

17:17.252 --> 17:20.954
housing, transportation,
and my work income, all the details.

17:20.973 --> 17:22.518
Wait a second. You have a job?

17:22.551 --> 17:25.135
At the L.A. County Museum of Art.

17:25.155 --> 17:26.892
- What about the...
- Start-up expenses?

17:26.912 --> 17:29.591
You'll find all those details in column
"b."

17:29.626 --> 17:31.560
How are you gonna pay for
the start-up expenses?

17:31.594 --> 17:35.164
Regina is letting me have some
of the money that Angelo left me.

17:35.198 --> 17:36.997
So I'm all set.

17:37.767 --> 17:40.269
Well, it seems your daughter
is intent on revisiting

17:40.303 --> 17:42.037
her notion of moving to L.A.

17:42.071 --> 17:43.959
Why do I have a bill for you

17:43.979 --> 17:46.839
from Dr. Larkin for an MRI?

17:47.323 --> 17:48.911
Okay, don't freak out.

17:48.945 --> 17:52.589
It turns out, like Angelo,
I have the genetic disposition

17:52.609 --> 17:54.149
towards developing an aneurysm.

17:54.184 --> 17:56.151
- Oh, my God.
- What? You have an aneurysm?

17:56.186 --> 17:57.219
How did you find out?
Why didn't you tell us?

17:57.253 --> 17:58.720
Do you have any idea how
dangerous that could be?

17:58.755 --> 18:00.574
Okay, hold on. Just let me explain.

18:01.024 --> 18:03.147
I don't have an aneurysm.

18:03.167 --> 18:06.176
But that doesn't mean I
won't develop one later on.

18:06.196 --> 18:08.797
I found out when we went to
Chicago to meet my cousin.

18:08.832 --> 18:12.000
It turns out Angelo had a sister

18:12.035 --> 18:14.262
who died of an aneurysm, too,

18:14.282 --> 18:16.129
which is why I got tested by Dr. Larkin.

18:16.149 --> 18:17.873
And I'm gonna continue
to get tested regularly,

18:17.907 --> 18:19.741
but right now, that's all I can do.

18:19.776 --> 18:21.677
And I've made my peace with it.

18:21.711 --> 18:24.813
You could have had an aneurysm
and you didn't even tell us.

18:24.848 --> 18:27.449
I didn't tell you because
I knew you would worry

18:27.483 --> 18:28.909
and that's not gonna change anything.

18:28.929 --> 18:30.586
I didn't wanna put you guys through that.

18:30.620 --> 18:32.904
Keeping us out of the
loop shows immaturity, which is why

18:32.924 --> 18:35.657
- you are not ready to go to L.A.
- You're not going.

18:35.692 --> 18:39.328
I wanted your blessing, but I'm 18 now,
and I really don't need it.

18:39.362 --> 18:41.372
I am going.

18:56.048 --> 18:58.624
Who would've thought that
we would end up graduating

18:58.644 --> 19:00.816
from the same school?

19:01.051 --> 19:03.967
Three years ago,
I didn't even know you existed.

19:04.576 --> 19:07.430
And I had never heard of Carlton.

19:08.348 --> 19:12.060
Do you remember that day?
The day we first met?

19:12.338 --> 19:15.118
I was so jealous of you back then.

19:16.843 --> 19:21.094
Now you're the one with
the perfect boyfriend.

19:21.578 --> 19:23.839
The perfect life next year in L.A.

19:24.098 --> 19:26.468
- Stop.
- No, it's true.

19:26.488 --> 19:29.878
You handled everything so
well after Angelo died.

19:30.213 --> 19:32.497
Daphne, I...

19:35.872 --> 19:37.734
_

19:37.754 --> 19:40.315
_

19:40.335 --> 19:41.278
Thank you.

19:41.427 --> 19:43.139
_

19:43.350 --> 19:47.706
_

19:50.362 --> 19:52.615
_

19:53.310 --> 19:55.461
_

19:55.481 --> 19:59.304
_

19:59.725 --> 20:03.136
_

20:03.156 --> 20:06.010
_

20:06.717 --> 20:08.790
_

20:13.261 --> 20:14.874
(Sobs)

20:15.507 --> 20:16.723
Hey.

20:18.287 --> 20:20.829
I've ruined my whole life.

20:21.092 --> 20:22.396
Don't say that.

20:22.416 --> 20:24.032
No, look, I know that

20:24.067 --> 20:27.069
it seems bad right now,

20:27.103 --> 20:29.201
but it is only three months.

20:29.221 --> 20:32.007
And when you get out,
you'll get back on track.

20:32.041 --> 20:34.643
You will go to Gallaudet
and then med school.

20:34.677 --> 20:36.051
Med school?

20:36.071 --> 20:38.930
I will be a convicted felon.

20:38.950 --> 20:42.971
Convicted felons don't go to med school.
That's over.

20:45.067 --> 20:46.888
I had no idea.

20:48.725 --> 20:51.036
All my plans,

20:51.056 --> 20:54.525
everything that I worked so hard for,

20:55.171 --> 20:58.600
will be gone the minute I
walk into that police station.

20:58.634 --> 21:01.078
("Graduation march" playing)

21:06.068 --> 21:08.510
- We have to go in.
- I can't do it.

21:09.133 --> 21:12.935
I can't stand up there
and give this speech.

21:12.955 --> 21:14.842
I can't.

21:22.909 --> 21:25.763
You can do this. Come on.

21:41.629 --> 21:44.024
_

21:44.260 --> 21:46.245
_

22:07.019 --> 22:09.331
I would like to welcome everyone

22:09.351 --> 22:14.506
to the 2014 Carlton School graduation.

22:21.157 --> 22:25.128
It is with great pleasure and pride

22:25.148 --> 22:29.063
that I welcome our student speaker.

22:29.083 --> 22:32.153
She was been voted overwhelmingly

22:32.173 --> 22:35.578
by her class to represent them today.

22:35.598 --> 22:38.345
A young woman I have known

22:38.365 --> 22:41.138
for more than a decade,

22:41.158 --> 22:44.377
Ms. Daphne Vasquez.

23:18.454 --> 23:21.284
Good afternoon, parents,

23:21.304 --> 23:24.663
siblings, teachers,

23:24.697 --> 23:26.898
and my fellow graduates.

23:29.635 --> 23:31.958
Until I was eight years old,

23:31.978 --> 23:34.788
I went to a hearing school.

23:34.808 --> 23:37.990
There I struggled

23:38.325 --> 23:40.049
to read lips,

23:40.069 --> 23:42.714
to follow what was happening around me.

23:44.574 --> 23:48.049
Struggled to make friends.

23:48.632 --> 23:52.640
Nobody liked to sit next to the weird,
deaf girl.

23:53.725 --> 23:56.951
But I was incredibly lucky.

23:56.971 --> 24:00.749
Because one day, an eight year old boy

24:00.769 --> 24:05.376
walking by my playground
on his way home saw me.

24:06.232 --> 24:08.408
He took me by the hand

24:08.428 --> 24:11.772
and led me back to his house.

24:12.445 --> 24:15.755
Introduced me to his mom.

24:17.158 --> 24:20.118
Introduced me to sign language.

24:21.196 --> 24:24.256
Introduced me to Carlton.

24:25.738 --> 24:28.679
And I've been here ever since.

24:29.436 --> 24:32.544
When they threatened to
close down our school,

24:32.564 --> 24:35.461
we fought valiantly

24:35.481 --> 24:38.439
for something that we truly believed in...

24:38.459 --> 24:40.176
deaf education.

24:40.196 --> 24:43.875
While Carlton didn't stay fully deaf,

24:43.910 --> 24:46.489
it did stay open

24:46.613 --> 24:49.753
one more year so that we all

24:49.754 --> 24:53.010
could graduate together today,

24:53.030 --> 24:56.696
and for that, I am so thankful

24:57.118 --> 24:59.128
and so proud.

24:59.492 --> 25:02.520
I'll admit that like many of us,

25:02.540 --> 25:05.473
I was nervous about hearing students

25:05.493 --> 25:08.433
invading our campus,

25:08.861 --> 25:12.059
but I was wrong to be nervous.

25:13.027 --> 25:15.099
The truth is

25:15.844 --> 25:19.256
one of those hearing "invaders"

25:19.976 --> 25:22.380
became one of the best friends

25:22.415 --> 25:24.416
that I've ever had.

25:26.563 --> 25:30.497
We weren't able to save
our school this time.

25:30.517 --> 25:32.991
(Booing)

25:33.951 --> 25:37.363
But we graduate today the final class

25:37.383 --> 25:38.976
of Carlton...

25:38.996 --> 25:42.475
diverse, unified,

25:42.495 --> 25:44.746
and most of all

25:45.453 --> 25:49.499
optimistic about our future.

25:52.179 --> 25:53.767
(Sighs)

25:53.980 --> 25:57.242
The last thing I'd like
to say today is thank you.

25:58.446 --> 26:01.536
A huge thank you to all of our families,

26:01.556 --> 26:04.790
but especially our siblings.

26:09.154 --> 26:11.425
No matter how we got them.

26:13.349 --> 26:15.788
And to our parents.

26:17.437 --> 26:21.633
Who have been there for us,
through everything.

26:40.795 --> 26:44.840
_

26:54.339 --> 26:57.182
Congratulations to all of us.

26:58.584 --> 27:00.846
Carlton forever.

27:35.292 --> 27:38.282

Stand by me)

Bay Kennish.

28:34.923 --> 28:36.958
Natalie Pierce.

28:41.898 --> 28:44.479
Daphne Vasquez.

29:40.217 --> 29:43.709
I present the graduating class

29:43.729 --> 29:46.779
of 2014!

30:04.846 --> 30:06.757
_

30:06.881 --> 30:09.425
_

30:09.880 --> 30:13.462
Thank you for everything that you've done.

30:13.636 --> 30:16.974
_

30:17.991 --> 30:21.119
_

30:25.596 --> 30:27.978
_

30:27.998 --> 30:30.286
_

30:32.708 --> 30:35.204
- I'm Karen.
- Hi.

30:37.076 --> 30:38.558
_

30:38.578 --> 30:40.700
I'm Mary Beth.

30:41.159 --> 30:42.775
Nice to meet you.

30:42.795 --> 30:45.952
Yeah, it's really nice to meet you, too.

30:45.972 --> 30:48.391
Your signing is really good.

30:48.875 --> 30:50.986
I have this app.

30:51.021 --> 30:54.797
I learn a sign a day.

30:55.095 --> 30:56.572
That's awesome.

30:56.592 --> 30:59.215
Thank you. I'm trying.

31:06.201 --> 31:10.011
_

31:12.306 --> 31:14.492
_

31:14.512 --> 31:16.788
_

31:16.808 --> 31:20.585
_

31:20.784 --> 31:22.856
_

31:22.876 --> 31:24.716
_

31:24.865 --> 31:29.642
_

31:30.263 --> 31:33.477
_

31:33.874 --> 31:36.816
_

31:37.474 --> 31:39.646
_

31:40.117 --> 31:43.493
_

31:43.790 --> 31:45.416
_

31:45.765 --> 31:49.898
_

31:53.186 --> 31:55.544
_

31:58.999 --> 32:00.625
(Laughs)

32:00.811 --> 32:02.591
And here come the waterworks.

32:02.626 --> 32:06.495
I can't believe it. My God. Look at you.

32:08.350 --> 32:11.626
My baby graduating from high school.

32:11.646 --> 32:15.213
You are such an incredible
talented young woman.

32:15.560 --> 32:18.428
I thought you were upset
at me for moving to L.A.?

32:18.448 --> 32:21.277
Well, I am a bit nervous.

32:21.311 --> 32:23.012
But you're right.

32:23.046 --> 32:25.931
You're old enough to make up your own mind.

32:26.501 --> 32:28.827
- Hi.
- Hey.

32:44.474 --> 32:45.939
(Sniffling)

32:50.136 --> 32:52.605
Okay, enough tears.

32:57.023 --> 32:59.838
How's it going, high school graduate?

33:00.645 --> 33:02.270
Back atcha.

33:02.531 --> 33:06.489
Hey,
so kick some ass at St. Louis U. next year.

33:06.509 --> 33:09.282
Will do. You do the same at Gallaudet.

33:17.069 --> 33:19.295
- Hey.
- Hey, lady.

33:19.315 --> 33:20.411
So I'm gonna go.

33:20.431 --> 33:23.345
But I'll see you guys at grad night, right?

33:23.365 --> 33:25.623
- Totally.
- Okay, see you.

33:29.669 --> 33:34.462
You promised that we would
have one more normal day.

33:34.482 --> 33:37.353
I can't. I can't go off to some party

33:37.387 --> 33:41.270
and pretend like my whole life
isn't over in a few hours.

33:42.481 --> 33:44.074
I'm gonna sneak out of here

33:44.094 --> 33:47.122
and go to the police
station and turn myself in.

33:49.021 --> 33:51.714
Have fun for both of us.

34:13.004 --> 34:15.958
Okay, I'm coming with you.

34:15.992 --> 34:17.993
What? No, I don't want you to miss the...

34:18.027 --> 34:20.524
You're not doing this alone.

34:25.588 --> 34:26.835
Let's go.

34:28.963 --> 34:30.960
- (Sighs)
- (Engine turns over)

34:34.141 --> 34:37.676
- I'm here about the noise.
- What noise?

34:37.710 --> 34:40.123
There isn't any. It's too quiet.

34:41.686 --> 34:45.016
Are you okay?
You seemed a little down today.

34:45.051 --> 34:48.333
Yeah, I just have a few things on my mind.

34:48.353 --> 34:50.938
Anything you want to talk about?

34:51.647 --> 34:54.630
My ex-wife left me a message today.

34:55.003 --> 34:57.721
She wants an annulment.

34:57.741 --> 34:59.247
Why?

34:59.267 --> 35:02.629
Clean slate in the eyes of the church,
I guess.

35:03.089 --> 35:05.062
Nikki's pretty religious.

35:10.613 --> 35:13.512
This doesn't mean that
she's forgotten about you

35:13.547 --> 35:15.414
or that it didn't mean anything

35:15.449 --> 35:18.171
- or even that she isn't still hurting.
- I know.

35:18.191 --> 35:20.565
I've been saying the same things to myself

35:20.585 --> 35:23.289
for the last two hours.

35:24.635 --> 35:26.000
Thank you.

35:26.326 --> 35:29.053
You have your music and your family

35:29.073 --> 35:31.163
and a million friends.

35:31.198 --> 35:34.003
I do. I do.

35:34.859 --> 35:36.981
The thing is...

35:37.001 --> 35:39.947
there's a million people

35:39.967 --> 35:42.065
to do something with,

35:42.085 --> 35:45.701
but there's just nobody

35:45.721 --> 35:48.195
to do nothing with.

35:49.585 --> 35:53.252
That's what I miss the most.

35:59.001 --> 36:01.026
I better...

36:03.690 --> 36:07.847
actually,
I was thinking about going upstairs

36:08.405 --> 36:10.317
and doing nothing.

36:11.830 --> 36:13.806
Do you want to come?

36:14.534 --> 36:18.210
Yeah, I'd love that.

36:24.566 --> 36:28.821
I know it wasn't you who
pressed charges against her.

36:29.728 --> 36:31.118
Who was it?

36:31.242 --> 36:33.270
The owner of the construction site.

36:33.290 --> 36:34.727
I spoke to my attorney.

36:34.761 --> 36:37.696
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have...
- It's okay.

36:38.335 --> 36:40.052
Been a hell of a year.

36:40.072 --> 36:41.634
I know.

36:43.001 --> 36:45.302
I pulled out of East Riverside.

36:45.322 --> 36:47.313
No. No, no, no.

36:47.333 --> 36:51.296
It wasn't you or your daughter,
any of this.

36:52.214 --> 36:54.786
It was just everything.

36:54.806 --> 36:56.896
Wasn't meant to be.

37:09.350 --> 37:11.764
Come with me to Hawaii.

37:13.371 --> 37:14.265
What?

37:14.285 --> 37:15.925
Well, your girls are out of the house.

37:15.945 --> 37:18.370
You need something new, a fresh start.

37:18.405 --> 37:20.439
Plus it's Hawaii.

37:21.435 --> 37:23.296
And...

37:23.991 --> 37:26.545
- I need you.
- Wes.

37:26.733 --> 37:29.895
I'll get you your own place
so there's no pressure.

37:30.230 --> 37:34.186
It'll be great to work on
something without any angry locals.

37:34.220 --> 37:37.456
Wes, with everything that's
going on with Daphne.

37:37.753 --> 37:41.116
I know. It's bad timing.

37:41.361 --> 37:44.363
But what are you gonna do,
just sit around and be miserable?

37:44.715 --> 37:47.644
Don't you deserve your own life?

37:48.589 --> 37:51.370
Please just say "yes."

37:52.597 --> 37:54.273
Please.

37:59.357 --> 38:01.082
John.

38:05.450 --> 38:07.378
How did this happen?

38:08.979 --> 38:10.189
How?

38:10.223 --> 38:12.292
Oh, sweetheart.

38:12.312 --> 38:14.938
I mean, it feels like we just got her.

38:16.650 --> 38:18.864
She's just a kid.

38:19.132 --> 38:21.664
She's not a kid anymore.

38:21.974 --> 38:24.061
I think we're gonna have
to try to accept that.

38:24.081 --> 38:27.524
I just cannot believe that I can't
do anything more to help her.

38:27.544 --> 38:30.427
There's nothing anybody can do.

38:30.447 --> 38:33.078
What is going to happen to her?

38:33.592 --> 38:36.514
I'll tell you what's
going to happen to her.

38:36.534 --> 38:39.157
She's gonna live through this.

38:39.177 --> 38:41.142
And so are we.

38:49.829 --> 38:53.396
Does your attorney know that you're here?
I can call her.

38:56.451 --> 38:58.970
I just want to get this over with.

38:58.990 --> 39:00.869
You're entitled to an interpreter. I can...

39:00.889 --> 39:02.743
No, I'm fine.

39:03.227 --> 39:05.063
All right, go ahead.

39:07.228 --> 39:09.040
A couple of weeks ago...

39:09.060 --> 39:12.484
I vandalized the construction site.

39:14.500 --> 39:16.163
Excuse me.

39:16.790 --> 39:19.385
It was me, not her.

39:19.820 --> 39:24.878
You found Daphne's fingerprints on the
tractor because she was there to stop me.

39:24.898 --> 39:27.461
- But I wouldn't listen.
- Bay.

39:27.481 --> 39:30.323
Don't try to take the blame anymore.

39:30.343 --> 39:32.593
I can't watch you do that.

39:32.613 --> 39:33.810
Bay what...?

39:33.946 --> 39:34.496
_

39:36.292 --> 39:38.352
_

39:38.678 --> 39:40.144
What's going on?

39:40.164 --> 39:43.564
It was my biological father who died,
not hers.

39:43.584 --> 39:45.632
She barely knew him.

39:45.652 --> 39:47.989
I was angry at my mom.

39:48.009 --> 39:50.756
They got into a big fight before he died

39:50.790 --> 39:52.370
and I wanted to get back at her.

39:52.390 --> 39:53.400
Hold on a second.

39:53.420 --> 39:57.696
And the the black spray paint that
was used at the site, that's mine.

39:57.731 --> 39:59.597
I have a bunch of it in
my art studio at home.

39:59.617 --> 40:01.980
I've been doing street
art for a long time now.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.504
I can show you some of the places
that I've tagged around town.

40:06.013 --> 40:08.674
All right, stay right here.

40:08.694 --> 40:10.767
Don't move.

40:13.124 --> 40:14.688
_

40:14.837 --> 40:17.604
_

40:17.778 --> 40:19.515
_

40:19.652 --> 40:23.313
_

40:23.735 --> 40:26.018
_

40:26.167 --> 40:28.021
_

40:28.041 --> 40:31.721
_

40:31.741 --> 40:36.585
_

40:39.824 --> 40:42.755
I just spoke to the D.A.
and if you're lying...

40:42.775 --> 40:47.179
I'm not. It's true.
I was there to stop her.

40:48.496 --> 40:50.788
I jumped the fence at Green Street.

40:50.808 --> 40:54.253
That's why I'm not on the ATM camera.

40:56.595 --> 40:58.524
Okay, then. You need to come with me.

40:58.558 --> 41:01.841
I'll need a formal statement.
You can call your attorney.
