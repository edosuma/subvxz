00:04.917 --> 00:06.528
<i>{\an8}Local authorities are baffled</i>

00:06.563 --> 00:08.463
<i>{\an8}at the large increase
in disappearances</i>

00:08.464 --> 00:09.748
<i>{\an8}in the last month.</i>

00:09.783 --> 00:11.402
<i>{\an8}Investigators aren't sure</i>

00:11.437 --> 00:13.187
<i>{\an8}if the missing persons
are connected</i>

00:13.188 --> 00:16.538
<i>{\an8}to numerous reports
of strange lights in the sky.</i>

00:16.573 --> 00:18.148
<i>{\an8}Seen here.</i>

00:18.183 --> 00:19.983
<i>{\an8}But authorities
are warning residents</i>

00:20.011 --> 00:21.804
<i>{\an8}to remain in their homes...</i>

00:21.839 --> 00:24.111
<i>{\an8}Especially, after dark.</i>

00:24.146 --> 00:26.635
<i>{\an8}At this time, reports
of missing hikers,</i>

00:26.670 --> 00:29.377
<i>{\an8}loved ones not
returning home after hours,</i>

00:29.412 --> 00:32.162
<i>{\an8}abandoned cars found
at traffic lights,</i>

00:32.197 --> 00:33.729
<i>{\an8}empty with the engine
running</i>

00:33.764 --> 00:36.014
<i>{\an8}are not currently linked
to these occurrances,</i>

00:36.015 --> 00:39.213
<i>{\an8}but many speculate
that they are related.</i>

00:39.248 --> 00:40.866
<i>{\an8}Authorities have launched</i>

00:40.901 --> 00:43.217
<i>{\an8}a countywide search
in hopes of discovering</i>

00:43.252 --> 00:46.089
<i>{\an8}any clues as to what
may have happened.</i>

00:46.124 --> 00:48.352
<i>{\an8}Nearby residents
should remain vigilant</i>

00:48.387 --> 00:52.443
<i>{\an8}and report
any strange behavior.</i>

00:52.478 --> 00:54.750
{\an8}It's been two days since
the hiker, Matt Pruitt,

00:54.785 --> 00:56.143
{\an8}shown here, went missing

00:56.178 --> 00:57.526
{\an8}Friends say it was
a routine hike

00:57.527 --> 00:59.320
{\an8}for the self-proclaimed
survivalist.

00:59.355 --> 01:01.182
{\an8}And authorities maintain that
Pruitt strayed off the trail

01:01.183 --> 01:02.661
{\an8}and may still be
lost in the woods.

01:02.662 --> 01:04.715
{\an8}But one hiker, an eyewitness,

01:04.751 --> 01:06.588
{\an8}believed that foul play
might be involved.

01:06.623 --> 01:09.765
{\an8}It's not a claim.
I saw it with my own two eyes.

01:09.800 --> 01:11.375
{\an8}He is not lost.

01:11.410 --> 01:13.725
{\an8}That thing took him!

01:13.760 --> 01:16.598
{\an8}- Thing?
- Yeah, a ship... in the sky.

01:16.633 --> 01:18.078
{\an8}Okay, well, thank you.

01:18.113 --> 01:19.765
{\an8}I'm sure authorities are
looking into it.

01:19.766 --> 01:21.027
{\an8}Look, I know you don't
believe me, but I saw it!

01:21.028 --> 01:22.430
{\an8}Park rangers are
encouraging...

01:22.465 --> 01:23.726
{\an8}Look, I saw it!

01:23.727 --> 01:24.944
{\an8}Hikers and campers to
report anything

01:24.945 --> 01:26.564
{\an8}that may lead to
the recovery of...

01:26.599 --> 01:28.165
{\an8}- This thing is out there!
- What the hell is that?

01:28.166 --> 01:30.742
{\an8}See? I told you!
That's what took Matt!

01:30.777 --> 01:32.077
{\an8}Well, what's it doing?

01:32.083 --> 01:34.398
{\an8}- He's... oh, my...!
- Run!

01:49.239 --> 01:51.241
Hey, guys, here we are

01:51.276 --> 01:53.809
in the back shop of
the robotics department.

01:53.844 --> 01:55.550
And we are gathering
some supplies

01:55.585 --> 01:58.292
for a little weekend
camping trip.

01:58.327 --> 02:00.685
I know what you guys
are thinking.

02:00.720 --> 02:04.298
What do robotics and camping
have to do with each other?

02:04.333 --> 02:07.823
Well, as some of you guys
may know, Chloe, Luke and I

02:07.858 --> 02:12.262
have been working
on something special.

02:12.297 --> 02:14.786
Hey, there's Chloe!

02:14.821 --> 02:16.039
Say hi, Chloe.

02:16.040 --> 02:17.340
You're still doing this?

02:17.346 --> 02:19.051
Tell them what
you're working on.

02:19.086 --> 02:21.576
I am writing the code

02:21.611 --> 02:23.360
for the new running
sequence cycle patch.

02:23.395 --> 02:26.407
- Oh.
- Yeah.

02:26.442 --> 02:28.138
Yeah, I thought you did
that two days ago.

02:28.139 --> 02:30.150
I mean, I was working on it
and I had to do

02:30.185 --> 02:32.360
the other sequences and it took
a lot longer than I thought.

02:32.361 --> 02:35.720
Okay. Um, just say something
for the camera.

02:35.755 --> 02:37.157
Look presentable.

02:37.192 --> 02:38.723
We need this to work, okay?

02:38.758 --> 02:40.421
Okay, yeah.

02:40.456 --> 02:41.499
Thank you.

02:41.500 --> 02:43.598
Hi! This is Chloe!
Say hi.

02:43.633 --> 02:45.165
Hi!

02:45.200 --> 02:48.646
These guys have been
working around the clock

02:48.681 --> 02:49.681
to make this work.
Isn't that right, Luke?

02:49.682 --> 02:54.739
Yeah, sure have been.

02:54.774 --> 02:56.035
You excited?

02:56.036 --> 02:57.829
Actually, yeah.

02:57.864 --> 03:00.005
Part of the team, doing
all the heavy lifting.

03:00.040 --> 03:02.399
Ready?
- Yeah.

03:02.434 --> 03:03.521
Chloe and I can do
heavy lifting too.

03:03.522 --> 03:04.880
Yeah? You sure you got that?

03:04.915 --> 03:06.664
Yeah, I got it.
You sure you got it?

03:06.699 --> 03:08.623
- Be careful, please.
- Hey, guys, careful!

03:08.658 --> 03:10.223
You remember what
happened last time.

03:11.713 --> 03:13.096
Watch the corner,
watch the corner.

03:13.097 --> 03:14.629
- Yep, yep. Thank you.
- Yep.

03:14.664 --> 03:16.108
Watch the corner!

03:16.143 --> 03:17.100
- I see it, I see it!
- I see the corner!

03:17.101 --> 03:19.634
One, two, three...

03:19.669 --> 03:20.969
Don't... okay.

03:22.332 --> 03:23.585
It's getting a lot heavier.

03:23.586 --> 03:26.684
- Yep.
- Well, he's a big guy.

03:26.719 --> 03:28.067
Any other updates
for the camera?

03:28.068 --> 03:29.992
Uh, yeah, updates.

03:30.027 --> 03:32.255
We, um...
We fixed his joints.

03:32.290 --> 03:33.691
He's moving a lot smoother now.

03:33.726 --> 03:35.780
And he's no longer top-heavy.

03:35.815 --> 03:37.381
His weight is now equally
distributed to him.

03:37.382 --> 03:39.001
- Yeah.
- Good.

03:39.036 --> 03:40.384
Hopefully, that new balance
patch works this time.

03:40.385 --> 03:41.385
Yes.

03:41.386 --> 03:45.442
Oh, and Professor Haley,

03:45.477 --> 03:47.705
if you're watching this,
don't get mad.

03:47.740 --> 03:50.186
We had to borrow some things
from the department.

03:50.221 --> 03:51.579
Don't get mad.
- Borrow.

03:51.614 --> 03:53.276
We'll bring it back
safe and sound.

03:53.311 --> 03:54.311
- We promise!
- Promise.

03:54.312 --> 03:55.887
Promise.

03:55.922 --> 03:57.227
All right, you guys,
cross your fingers for us!

03:57.228 --> 03:58.673
Bye!

03:58.708 --> 04:00.186
Professor Haley's on
the phone, guys!

04:00.187 --> 04:02.111
All right, guys,
lock up tonight!

04:18.301 --> 04:19.601
Hello?

04:21.696 --> 04:22.996
Hello?

04:26.744 --> 04:29.443
Why am I here?

04:29.478 --> 04:31.445
Where's Helen?
Where's Chloe?

04:33.273 --> 04:35.362
Tell me what I'm doing here!

04:37.581 --> 04:40.410
Sit down.
We will begin momentarily.

04:47.548 --> 04:49.201
Guys, I'm sorry, okay?

04:49.236 --> 04:51.116
Here we are getting gas

04:51.151 --> 04:53.771
because Luke didn't look at
the itinerary I sent out to him.

04:53.806 --> 04:55.164
I looked at it.

04:55.199 --> 04:56.504
I just had so many things,
I forgot, okay?

04:56.505 --> 04:58.113
We had so many things
to do too, Luke.

04:58.115 --> 04:59.603
What did you think
we were doing?

04:59.638 --> 05:01.475
- Honest mistake.
- We can't get too...

05:01.510 --> 05:02.597
All right, we're here.
We're here now.

05:02.598 --> 05:04.782
We're off schedule anyways.

05:04.817 --> 05:07.350
- All right.
- Yep, yep, yep.

05:09.570 --> 05:12.224
Do you wait or
do you do it yourself?

05:12.259 --> 05:13.748
What's happening?

05:13.783 --> 05:15.436
I mean, I don't see any
credit card slot.

05:15.437 --> 05:16.524
- I don't know. Hello?
- It's really old-timey.

05:16.525 --> 05:19.536
Do you need to go get them.

05:19.571 --> 05:21.233
Is this a working gas station?

05:21.268 --> 05:23.975
- Yeah, sure.
- It looks antique.

05:24.010 --> 05:27.762
You guys seeing this?
This door?

05:27.797 --> 05:30.068
It might just be the wind.

05:30.103 --> 05:32.723
Very vintage.

05:32.758 --> 05:35.291
Helen, stay.
I'll check it out, all right?

05:39.121 --> 05:41.210
Is there anyone in there?

05:41.245 --> 05:42.864
Hold on.

05:45.257 --> 05:47.172
Are you sure?

05:49.000 --> 05:50.480
Hello?

05:53.788 --> 05:57.139
That's weird.
- Where is everyone?

05:57.174 --> 06:01.796
Feel like I haven't seen like
a car on the road either.

06:01.831 --> 06:03.406
Yeah, it's a little creepy.

06:03.441 --> 06:06.235
Yeah, I don't know. Um...

06:06.270 --> 06:08.019
Like a ghost town, I guess.

06:08.054 --> 06:10.065
Yeah, I guess we'll get
gas on the way back.

06:10.100 --> 06:11.274
Do we have enough?

06:11.275 --> 06:12.589
Yeah. I think we'll be fine.

06:12.624 --> 06:14.286
You think?

06:14.321 --> 06:17.812
What are you looking at?

06:17.847 --> 06:19.814
- Do you see something?
- Do you see that?

06:19.849 --> 06:22.599
No.
What... well, like a coyote?

06:22.634 --> 06:24.384
What'd you see?

06:24.419 --> 06:26.603
Maybe. I don't know.
Just get back in the truck.

06:26.638 --> 06:27.996
We'll be fine.

06:32.348 --> 06:33.648
Great.

06:39.529 --> 06:41.183
We can make it?

06:41.218 --> 06:43.054
- Yeah.
- All right.

06:43.089 --> 06:45.448
Well, let's just go in,
get it on the way back.

06:47.319 --> 06:49.670
All right.

06:49.705 --> 06:50.748
Chloe, did you see that, though?

06:50.749 --> 06:52.412
What?

06:52.447 --> 06:54.143
No, I didn't see...
he said he saw something.

06:54.144 --> 06:55.502
I don't know.

06:55.537 --> 06:57.059
All right, well,
guys, this is exciting.

06:57.060 --> 06:58.060
Let's go.
Let's just go.

06:58.061 --> 06:59.361
Yeah, those...

06:59.366 --> 07:01.508
Let's just start
what we started.

07:01.543 --> 07:03.727
Fun little ghost town
adventure.

07:03.762 --> 07:05.555
- All right.
- Let's keep moving.

07:07.601 --> 07:08.993
All right.
And you're recording.

07:09.028 --> 07:10.517
Awesome.

07:10.552 --> 07:12.693
Let's see yours.
Is that on too tight?

07:12.728 --> 07:14.390
- No.
- Good.

07:14.425 --> 07:15.870
Yeah.

07:19.743 --> 07:21.049
How does that feel?

07:21.084 --> 07:22.616
Nice.

07:22.651 --> 07:23.965
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.967
- Cool.
- Yep.

07:35.237 --> 07:37.195
Good. We need
to get every angle.

07:37.230 --> 07:39.405
I don't want anyone doubting
what's about to happen.

07:39.406 --> 07:41.591
This is mot a magic trick.

07:41.626 --> 07:42.926
Let's get eyes on us.

07:50.121 --> 07:52.950
Okay, drone online.

07:52.985 --> 07:54.691
Roll call?
Chloe?

07:54.726 --> 07:56.650
- Here.
- Luke?

07:56.685 --> 08:00.392
- Here.
- Me?

08:00.427 --> 08:04.092
I am here rolling
on both cams.

08:04.127 --> 08:06.050
Hello.

08:06.085 --> 08:09.924
It's October 13th and
I'm Helen Martin

08:09.959 --> 08:12.361
joined by my colleagues,
Luke Sullivan...

08:12.396 --> 08:14.711
- Here.
- And Chloe Coyle.

08:14.746 --> 08:18.062
These following video logs
will serve as documentation

08:18.097 --> 08:20.891
for Project Hornet.

08:20.926 --> 08:23.938
What my team is unveiling here
the first time on camera

08:23.973 --> 08:26.593
is nine months of our blood,

08:26.628 --> 08:29.944
sweat and hard work advancing

08:29.979 --> 08:31.685
what you see before you.

08:31.720 --> 08:34.601
Let me introduce you
to Hornet.

08:40.345 --> 08:42.652
Are you standing up?

08:45.829 --> 08:48.702
He stood up.

08:52.314 --> 08:54.534
Hornet was built to be

08:54.569 --> 08:56.971
a Crisis Relief Emergency
Aide Teammate.

08:57.006 --> 08:59.451
But CREAT is such a
boring acronym,

08:59.486 --> 09:02.106
so we just affectionately
call him Hornet.

09:02.141 --> 09:04.195
I mean, just look
at his paint job.

09:04.230 --> 09:06.415
It wasn't intentional,
I can assure you.

09:06.450 --> 09:08.199
We needed him to stand out.

09:08.234 --> 09:09.592
Say hi, Hornet.

09:09.627 --> 09:11.768
Hello.

09:11.803 --> 09:15.032
We'll be using these video
logs as Hornet's beta tests.

09:15.067 --> 09:18.427
We scouted this location for the
utmost privacy and durability.

09:18.462 --> 09:20.429
And for the next 24 hours,

09:20.464 --> 09:26.348
we'll be onsite with
Hornet making history.

09:26.383 --> 09:28.393
He's looking sharp,
really sharp.

09:28.428 --> 09:29.559
Uh-huh.
Yep.

09:29.560 --> 09:30.560
Not bad, Chloe, not bad.

09:30.561 --> 09:31.779
Well, thank you.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.529
Hey, we're a team here.

09:33.564 --> 09:35.043
You did all right, Luke.
You did all right.

09:35.044 --> 09:36.750
All right.
All right, I'll take it.

09:36.785 --> 09:37.828
Well, you know, he hasn't
done anything yet, so.

09:37.829 --> 09:40.362
Okay. What are
we waiting for?

09:40.397 --> 09:41.571
- Let's do it.
- I know.

09:41.572 --> 09:42.872
Yeah.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.541
Yay!

09:49.197 --> 09:52.156
I need to know that
my friends are okay!

10:00.295 --> 10:03.603
Mr. Luke Sullivan?

10:06.040 --> 10:08.172
We believe that you and
your associates

10:08.207 --> 10:11.349
were witness to an
extraordinary event.

10:11.384 --> 10:15.179
I'd say, but I ain't
gonna tell you anything

10:15.214 --> 10:17.181
until I know
where my friends are.

10:19.096 --> 10:23.884
Mr. Sullivan, we have concerns
that you and your friends

10:23.919 --> 10:27.452
might be a threat
to national security.

10:27.487 --> 10:29.280
We're the threat?

10:29.315 --> 10:33.284
Are you kidding me?
No! No, not a chance!

10:33.319 --> 10:37.071
I ain't telling you shit, okay,
until I see my friends.

10:37.106 --> 10:39.987
Where's Helen?
Where's Chloe?

10:40.022 --> 10:42.642
If I don't see them, I ain't
telling you another word.

10:47.429 --> 10:50.606
It started with an experiment.

10:50.641 --> 10:53.217
My friends and I,
we built a robot,

10:53.252 --> 10:57.657
a fully functioning
assistant machine.

10:57.692 --> 11:00.616
And then we took it out into the
field for its first field test.

11:01.965 --> 11:03.445
- Almost ready?
- Yep, yep.

11:03.480 --> 11:04.780
Almost got it.

11:04.786 --> 11:06.134
Hey, Chloe, can I get
a snack bar?

11:06.135 --> 11:07.579
Can't come over here yourself?

11:07.614 --> 11:09.103
'Cause I'm not
like busy at all?

11:09.138 --> 11:13.411
Hey, careful.

11:13.446 --> 11:15.979
- All right.
- Nice.

11:16.014 --> 11:17.502
Now we'll see
what you see, buddy.

11:17.537 --> 11:20.114
Ready, buddy? Begin.

11:20.149 --> 11:22.333
Oh, Robo can jump.

11:22.368 --> 11:23.770
- Woo!
- Wow.

11:23.805 --> 11:26.990
Look at that!

11:27.025 --> 11:29.166
- Big jump!
- Oh, someone's excited!

11:29.201 --> 11:30.646
Okay.

11:30.681 --> 11:32.116
Told you loosening
his joints was great.

11:32.117 --> 11:33.518
No, you were right.
You're right.

11:33.553 --> 11:35.346
Okay, all right.

11:35.381 --> 11:36.599
Are we ready?

11:36.600 --> 11:39.437
Yeah. He is set.

11:39.472 --> 11:42.919
Hornet, initiate
rescue protocol!

11:46.227 --> 11:48.098
Oh, my gosh!

11:51.798 --> 11:54.235
He's going so fast!

11:54.270 --> 11:55.270
Are you kidding me?

11:55.271 --> 11:56.488
50 miles per hour!

11:56.489 --> 11:57.707
I hope he doesn't eat it.

11:57.708 --> 11:59.414
Approaching GPS position.

11:59.449 --> 12:00.579
I got it, easy. Come on!

12:00.580 --> 12:02.112
Oh, my gosh.

12:02.147 --> 12:03.495
This is his first day.
Don't push it too hard.

12:03.496 --> 12:04.583
He's all right!
He's all right.

12:04.584 --> 12:06.464
He's all right!

12:09.685 --> 12:11.643
Ah, but I can't
see him anymore.

12:11.678 --> 12:14.472
Okay, he's out of frame.

12:14.507 --> 12:16.083
Uh, what do we do?

12:16.118 --> 12:17.998
- Let's go get him. Come on.
- Back?

12:18.033 --> 12:19.651
- Let's get him.
- Get him? Get him?

12:19.686 --> 12:21.610
What? Should we go?

12:21.645 --> 12:23.481
Okay, okay, okay,
okay, I'm coming!

12:39.976 --> 12:41.848
He's going too far!

12:43.066 --> 12:44.676
Hornet?

12:44.711 --> 12:46.374
He's having fun.

13:05.132 --> 13:08.396
Hornet! Wait up!

13:08.431 --> 13:10.006
Stop!

13:24.586 --> 13:26.414
All right, test three,
take one.

13:26.449 --> 13:28.198
Hornet, hurry!

13:28.233 --> 13:29.625
Someone's about to fall
out of the tree!

13:29.626 --> 13:32.550
Come on, buddy, come on,
buddy, come on.

13:32.585 --> 13:34.378
- Come on, come on.
- Hurry up!

13:34.413 --> 13:35.945
He's about to fall out!

13:35.980 --> 13:37.459
Here we go, here we go,
here we go, here we go.

13:37.460 --> 13:38.774
Come on! Hurry!

13:38.809 --> 13:39.940
Hurry up!
He's about to fall out!

13:39.941 --> 13:41.951
Come on!

13:41.986 --> 13:43.464
Look at him!
He's scaling the tree!

13:43.466 --> 13:44.766
Oh!

13:49.480 --> 13:50.786
- Did you see that?
- I know!

13:50.821 --> 13:52.527
I got that!
I got it!

13:52.562 --> 13:54.171
Did you get that? Please tell
me you got caught it.

13:54.172 --> 13:55.660
I caught it.

14:00.665 --> 14:02.798
He flew!

14:04.365 --> 14:07.324
If you're seeing this,
with a bit more funding

14:07.359 --> 14:09.979
and some tweaks, Hornet can
absolutely take full flight!

14:10.014 --> 14:12.373
Oh, my God!

14:12.408 --> 14:13.765
Excellent job, everybody!

14:13.800 --> 14:15.115
Especially you, big guy!

14:15.150 --> 14:18.596
He grabbed it right
out of the air!

14:18.631 --> 14:20.424
It was amazing.

14:20.459 --> 14:23.166
His interface is so much more
complex than we realized.

14:23.201 --> 14:26.082
The implications for
artificial intelligence alone!

14:26.117 --> 14:28.389
Look, guys, all in,
all in, all in!

14:33.046 --> 14:34.342
We built that!

14:34.343 --> 14:36.136
- It actually works!
- I know.

14:36.171 --> 14:37.432
Danger!

14:37.433 --> 14:38.790
Yes, buddy, you
detected danger

14:38.825 --> 14:40.130
and you inferred a crisis
all on your own!

14:40.131 --> 14:41.532
No, no, no, no, no.

14:41.567 --> 14:42.654
Scanners indicate
individuals approaching.

14:42.655 --> 14:44.231
- What?
- Yeah, like...

14:44.266 --> 14:45.831
I thought you said
it was deep enough in the woods.

14:45.832 --> 14:47.094
We'd be clear.
- I thought it was. I...

14:47.095 --> 14:48.356
Shh.

14:48.357 --> 14:50.280
Where? Where?
Hornet, where?

14:50.315 --> 14:52.021
Let's move.
Let's go.

14:52.056 --> 14:54.144
- We gotta hide him, right?
- Yeah, we gotta hide him.

14:54.145 --> 14:55.445
Come on, Hornet.

14:58.462 --> 14:59.497
The trees are
dense over there.

14:59.498 --> 15:03.119
Hide Hornet.
- On it.

15:03.154 --> 15:05.165
- Hornet, come with me.
- Affirmative.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.254
Shh! Shh!
Come on!

15:13.042 --> 15:16.828
No respect for nature.

15:16.863 --> 15:18.352
Pull the drone in.

15:18.387 --> 15:20.006
Shh, shh.

15:20.041 --> 15:21.877
Pull the lights.

15:28.840 --> 15:30.451
Hi.

15:30.486 --> 15:34.150
Does this belong to you?

15:34.185 --> 15:36.065
Yeah. Is there an
issue, officer?

15:36.100 --> 15:38.232
This portion of the forest
is restricted to camping.

15:38.233 --> 15:39.895
You're not supposed to be here.

15:44.073 --> 15:45.379
What are y'all doing here?

15:45.414 --> 15:48.251
Uh, we... uh...

15:52.603 --> 15:53.595
Bathroom break.

15:53.596 --> 15:54.896
Long hike.

15:54.901 --> 15:56.956
He has the worst bladder!

15:56.991 --> 15:58.435
Yeah, just flows
right through me.

15:58.470 --> 15:59.871
Yep.

15:59.906 --> 16:01.830
All right, you three
are going... now.

16:01.865 --> 16:03.397
He has the worst bladder.

16:03.432 --> 16:05.529
Worst ever!
Bladder like a baby!

16:05.564 --> 16:07.488
Worst, yep, yep.

16:07.523 --> 16:09.055
Hornet!

16:09.090 --> 16:10.970
All right. Three of you
guys need to leave.

16:11.005 --> 16:13.265
Leave? We're not camping.
We're just passing through.

16:13.268 --> 16:15.235
Yeah.

16:15.270 --> 16:17.541
I need you three
to leave right now.

16:17.576 --> 16:18.837
Hornet!
What are you doing?

16:18.838 --> 16:20.631
Move.
- But...

16:20.666 --> 16:21.884
Hey, I'm sick and tired
of the level of disrespect

16:21.885 --> 16:23.634
for the forest.
- Hornet, sit down.

16:23.669 --> 16:25.409
It's not your personal party
playground where you can

16:25.410 --> 16:27.194
just come and do drugs
or whatever's up your sleeve.

16:27.195 --> 16:31.120
- We're not doing drugs.
- Sir, we don't do drugs.

16:31.155 --> 16:32.643
What did I say?

16:35.211 --> 16:37.126
Graham are you there?

16:37.161 --> 16:39.346
Graham here.

16:39.381 --> 16:41.000
We have a situation
in Quadrant Four.

16:41.035 --> 16:43.002
Can you get down over here?

16:43.037 --> 16:45.221
Graham? Anybody?

16:45.256 --> 16:47.006
Graham!

16:47.041 --> 16:49.051
Dispatch!

16:52.794 --> 16:54.665
Dispatch?

17:00.106 --> 17:02.195
All right, I gotta go,
and so do you.

17:02.230 --> 17:03.761
Okay.

17:03.796 --> 17:06.373
We will pack up our things
and leave ASAP.

17:06.407 --> 17:07.407
You have my word.

17:07.409 --> 17:08.670
- Mm-hmm.
- No.

17:08.671 --> 17:09.887
Nope, you guys are gonna
do it right now.

17:09.888 --> 17:11.334
Okay, but what
about our things?

17:11.368 --> 17:12.674
What about the "leave
only footprints" adage?

17:12.675 --> 17:14.598
As a ranger, you must agree.

17:14.633 --> 17:17.601
You should've thought about
that before you pissed me off.

17:17.636 --> 17:19.637
Now you kids have already
broken the rules once.

17:19.637 --> 17:22.432
I can't trust that
you won't break them again.

17:22.467 --> 17:25.261
I'm gonna get somebody
to clean this up.

17:25.296 --> 17:27.220
We'll pack up your belongings
and then

17:27.255 --> 17:28.385
you guys can come by later
and pick it up.

17:28.386 --> 17:29.831
That doesn't make any sense.

17:29.866 --> 17:32.660
We can just
pick our stuff up now.

17:32.695 --> 17:34.696
No. Either you do it the way
I told you to do it,

17:34.697 --> 17:36.446
or I'm gonna arrest
you guys, all three.

17:36.481 --> 17:38.057
What?

17:38.092 --> 17:39.884
Do you even have that
authority, Ranger?

17:39.919 --> 17:40.876
What's your badge number?
- Whoa, Helen, Helen, Helen...

17:40.877 --> 17:43.584
Okay! Okay, okay!

17:43.619 --> 17:44.880
Luke, keys?
I'm driving!

17:44.881 --> 17:46.326
Coming.

17:48.154 --> 17:50.286
Thanks.
I almost finished.

17:50.321 --> 17:51.983
Just gonna grab my jacket.

17:57.032 --> 18:00.166
- We're not even camping.
- I know.

18:04.692 --> 18:05.770
Keys?

18:05.771 --> 18:07.303
He's stuck back there.

18:07.338 --> 18:09.436
- I know.
- He's gonna find him.

18:09.471 --> 18:10.828
I know.
We'll figure it out.

18:10.863 --> 18:12.830
We'll figure it out.

18:12.865 --> 18:15.877
All right, well, let's make
it look like we're leaving.

18:15.912 --> 18:17.487
Here, go on out there.

18:25.669 --> 18:27.671
It's a nice fairy tale,

18:27.706 --> 18:30.892
a couple of college kids
build a robot,

18:30.927 --> 18:34.417
take it to the forest,
have some fun.

18:34.452 --> 18:36.941
But, you see, I'm skeptical
of this whole thing.

18:36.976 --> 18:39.335
What are you talking about?
That's how it was.

18:43.818 --> 18:48.388
So, Mr. Sullivan,

18:48.423 --> 18:53.132
you graduated from high
school with a 2.0 average.

18:53.167 --> 18:57.962
Now someone like you is at
university building robots?

19:00.400 --> 19:05.056
I was good at
auto workshop.

19:05.091 --> 19:07.798
- Uh-huh.
- Okay?

19:07.833 --> 19:12.238
Well, fixing a car
is a far cry

19:12.273 --> 19:14.109
from robotic technology.

19:14.144 --> 19:17.330
There are sensors,
software to worry about,

19:17.365 --> 19:18.539
not to mention flight.

19:18.540 --> 19:19.984
Yeah, I know.

19:20.019 --> 19:22.161
I leave the smart stuff
up to Helen and Chloe.

19:22.196 --> 19:26.469
They do the programming.
I build the gadgets.

19:26.504 --> 19:28.428
Shit, I'm an engineering pro.

19:28.463 --> 19:30.299
I don't need school
to tell me that.

19:30.334 --> 19:32.475
But you got this thing to fly?

19:32.510 --> 19:34.695
So what?

19:34.730 --> 19:37.132
Anything can fly as long
as you can stabilize it.

19:37.167 --> 19:40.875
Drones fly.
Bet you have some of those.

19:40.910 --> 19:42.210
Fascinating.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.272
What's your problem?

19:46.307 --> 19:50.101
- My problem?
- Yeah.

19:50.136 --> 19:52.974
My problem...

19:53.009 --> 19:56.804
Look, you can interrogate me
and you ask me about Hornet?

19:56.839 --> 19:58.414
You don't give a shit.

19:58.449 --> 20:01.156
I'm not gonna say
another word to you

20:01.191 --> 20:02.625
until I know where
my friends are.

20:04.551 --> 20:09.382
See, you don't get
to make demands here.

20:11.732 --> 20:14.822
Frankly, you're at my mercy.

20:14.857 --> 20:17.955
No. Screw that.

20:17.990 --> 20:20.436
Well, you are screwed,
Mr. Sullivan.

20:23.657 --> 20:27.878
You act all tough,
but underneath all this,

20:27.913 --> 20:30.664
you're just a
scared little child.

20:30.699 --> 20:33.449
You see, I now your type.

20:33.484 --> 20:36.017
You are the goofball.

20:36.052 --> 20:39.629
You are supposedly strong

20:39.664 --> 20:42.719
or at least you play that way.

20:42.754 --> 20:46.419
You're sincere mostly, but
underneath all that bravado,

20:46.454 --> 20:50.597
you're just a little insect.

20:50.632 --> 20:52.773
Would you quit with
the psychoanalysis shit?

20:52.808 --> 20:55.036
You're hurting my head.

20:55.071 --> 20:57.212
I don't need to analyze you.

20:57.247 --> 21:01.477
You see, I know you.

21:01.512 --> 21:05.699
You're the resident goofball,

21:05.734 --> 21:09.442
the guy who wants the girl.

21:09.477 --> 21:13.010
You're the guy who
can't protect the girl.

21:13.045 --> 21:15.274
What are you talking about?

21:17.014 --> 21:18.407
See how uncomplicated you are?

21:18.442 --> 21:20.453
You talking about Chloe?
Is she okay?

21:20.488 --> 21:21.749
I don't know what
you're talking about.

21:21.750 --> 21:23.238
I could kill you!

21:27.329 --> 21:32.160
One of us may not
be leaving this room.

21:32.195 --> 21:34.336
I don't think
I'd bet on me, though.

21:43.432 --> 21:47.654
Okay, if I answer
your stupid questions,

21:47.689 --> 21:49.699
will you let me see my friends?

21:53.399 --> 21:55.052
We'll see.

21:55.087 --> 21:57.316
What else
do you want to know?

21:57.351 --> 22:00.928
This, uh, robot,

22:00.963 --> 22:03.322
how did you get the funding?

22:03.357 --> 22:05.672
The professor got the money,

22:05.707 --> 22:11.068
figured it was some
research grants or something.

22:11.103 --> 22:14.681
So how much did this
robot cost to build?

22:14.716 --> 22:17.074
I don't know.
I didn't worry about the money.

22:17.109 --> 22:18.902
I just got the parts.

22:18.937 --> 22:22.645
So who was responsible
for handling these resources?

22:22.680 --> 22:25.692
I don't know.
Helen maybe?

22:25.727 --> 22:27.607
Look, I'm just a gearhead.

22:27.642 --> 22:29.348
You point at something,
I'll build it.

22:31.741 --> 22:36.050
How long did this Hornet
take to construct?

22:36.085 --> 22:39.053
A few months.

22:39.088 --> 22:40.393
I mean, we had most
of the parts.

22:40.394 --> 22:43.753
We built a few,
printed out some more.

22:43.788 --> 22:45.320
Hmm.

22:45.355 --> 22:48.932
It seems like a short
gestation period

22:48.967 --> 22:50.934
for such a complicated thing.

22:50.969 --> 22:53.502
I guess.

22:53.537 --> 22:57.288
And you never thought
this was weird

22:57.323 --> 23:00.117
or strange in any way?

23:00.152 --> 23:01.771
Weird like how?

23:01.806 --> 23:05.645
Well, I mean, you
and your friends built

23:05.680 --> 23:11.433
this surprisingly sophisticated
technical piece of machinery

23:11.468 --> 23:13.392
and you had
very little resources.

23:13.427 --> 23:16.395
And this didn't strike
you as odd in any way?

23:17.744 --> 23:19.920
What do I know?

23:19.955 --> 23:22.401
I'm just a stupid
goofball, remember?

23:25.534 --> 23:27.362
Luke...

23:27.397 --> 23:29.582
Look, Luke, I think
you're holding out on me.

23:32.367 --> 23:36.545
What do you want me to say?

23:36.580 --> 23:37.880
You don't believe me?

23:39.026 --> 23:41.332
So tell me what
happened after?

23:41.367 --> 23:43.160
After the Ranger?

23:43.195 --> 23:45.772
Yes.

23:45.807 --> 23:48.644
After the Ranger showed up.

23:48.679 --> 23:52.387
I mean, we hopped
back in the car

23:52.422 --> 23:54.998
and then shit got really weird.

23:55.033 --> 23:57.479
If you didn't
believe me before,

23:57.514 --> 23:59.176
you're not gonna
believe me now.

24:00.569 --> 24:03.224
Try me.

24:03.259 --> 24:05.444
Don't say I didn't warn you.

24:07.271 --> 24:08.829
Look, we just can't
just keep our stuff there.

24:08.830 --> 24:10.439
And we're not,
but we gotta leave for now

24:10.440 --> 24:12.189
or we risk arrest or worse.

24:12.224 --> 24:14.017
We risk Hornet. I agree.

24:14.052 --> 24:16.193
Hornet's not ready
to be exposed to the world!

24:16.228 --> 24:17.717
We could get him taken away!

24:17.752 --> 24:20.633
Okay, so we just leave
a piece of expensive,

24:20.668 --> 24:23.331
irreplaceable
high-tech machinery

24:23.366 --> 24:25.246
to be exposed to the elements!

24:25.281 --> 24:28.075
He's a 10-foot tall robot.
I think that he can manage.

24:28.110 --> 24:30.730
Look, guys, we're just gonna
make it look like we left.

24:30.765 --> 24:32.505
And as soon as we're sure as
we're sure the coast is clear,

24:32.506 --> 24:34.385
we'll double back
and we'll grab Hornet.

24:34.420 --> 24:35.420
We'll get outta here!

24:35.421 --> 24:36.866
What about that Ranger?

24:36.901 --> 24:38.728
You heard him!
He has other stuff to deal with!

24:38.729 --> 24:39.947
Hey!

24:39.948 --> 24:43.046
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my...

24:43.081 --> 24:46.310
What?

24:46.345 --> 24:49.009
Why is he just standing there?

24:49.044 --> 24:50.706
Sir, I am so sorry!

24:50.741 --> 24:52.447
Did you hit him?
Are you okay?

24:52.482 --> 24:53.873
- Are you okay?
- Helen, careful.

24:53.875 --> 24:55.537
My God, is he holding
a hatchet?

24:55.572 --> 24:57.147
Don't get too close! Guys...

24:57.182 --> 24:58.400
- Are you all right?
- Sir, are you okay?

24:58.401 --> 24:59.701
Guys!

24:59.707 --> 25:01.674
- Can you hear us?
- Be careful!

25:01.709 --> 25:03.719
Sir, can you hear us?

25:03.754 --> 25:05.329
Are you lost?
Do you need help?

25:05.364 --> 25:06.664
Guys, he has a hatchet.

25:06.670 --> 25:08.898
Do you need us
to get you some help?

25:08.933 --> 25:12.075
Guys, get in the truck.

25:12.110 --> 25:14.164
Helen, Luke, I think we should
get in the truck.

25:14.199 --> 25:16.515
Yeah, listen.
Helen, back in the car.

25:16.550 --> 25:20.040
- We're gonna get you help.
- Helen. Please? Please?

25:23.043 --> 25:24.513
- What the hell?
- Did you see this?

25:24.514 --> 25:26.916
- What is his deal?
- Wait. What?

25:26.951 --> 25:28.343
He's got this black stuff
coming right out of his mouth.

25:28.344 --> 25:30.877
He didn't even look...
- What?

25:30.912 --> 25:32.086
I think he's sick.
I think we need to help him.

25:32.087 --> 25:33.923
I don't know.

25:33.958 --> 25:36.186
No. I don't think...
he didn't even respond to us.

25:36.221 --> 25:37.570
- Oh, my God.
- We don't even... what?

25:37.571 --> 25:38.788
- What?
- Luke, Luke, Luke, Luke...

25:38.789 --> 25:40.974
Oh, shit.
Oh, my God.

25:41.009 --> 25:42.879
That's it! That's it!
- Who is that? What is that?

25:42.880 --> 25:45.195
What do you want?

25:45.230 --> 25:46.534
He's just staring at me, guys!

25:46.536 --> 25:47.894
This is a joke!
This is a...

25:47.929 --> 25:51.854
What is he doing?
What is he doing?

25:51.889 --> 25:54.901
- Is this a joke?
- Get away!

25:54.936 --> 25:57.468
This isn't funny, okay?
- He's leaving.

25:57.503 --> 25:58.634
- Is that blood?
- What?

25:58.635 --> 25:59.722
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

25:59.723 --> 26:00.897
Guys, he has a hatchet!

26:00.898 --> 26:03.562
Helen, put it...
Oh, shit!

26:03.597 --> 26:04.901
Oh, my God,
there's more of them!

26:04.902 --> 26:06.033
There's more of them!

26:06.034 --> 26:07.566
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

26:07.601 --> 26:09.959
- What the hell is that?
- What is that?

26:09.994 --> 26:11.255
Helen, get that!

26:11.256 --> 26:13.310
Oh, my God!
- What is happening?

26:13.345 --> 26:15.695
- Guys, he's not here anymore.
- They're just staring at us!

26:15.696 --> 26:19.273
- Oh, my God, what is happening?
- Guys, he's not here anymore.

26:21.362 --> 26:25.148
He's on the roof!
He's on the roof!

26:25.183 --> 26:26.672
What is that? What is it?

26:26.707 --> 26:29.631
What's on the roof?
Is it one of them?

26:31.198 --> 26:32.591
- What do you want?
- Go away!

26:32.626 --> 26:36.290
- What do you want from us?
- Go away!

26:38.248 --> 26:40.511
Go, go, go, go!

26:40.546 --> 26:42.122
Run, run, run, run!

26:48.694 --> 26:50.478
What do they want?

26:50.513 --> 26:52.001
What do you want from us?

26:53.655 --> 26:55.483
Is this a joke?
It's not funny!

26:55.518 --> 26:57.224
What do you want from us?

26:57.259 --> 27:01.750
What are they doing?
What are they doing?

27:01.785 --> 27:03.090
I don't know,
but that's the truck!

27:03.091 --> 27:04.391
We can't just leave it!

27:07.277 --> 27:09.932
This is...
This is not funny!

27:09.967 --> 27:11.267
Oh, my God!

27:13.414 --> 27:15.068
They're just staring at...
oh, shit!

27:15.103 --> 27:16.504
Oh, my God!

27:16.539 --> 27:20.682
They're coming! God!
Helen, come on!

27:20.717 --> 27:22.553
Go, go, go, go!

27:30.170 --> 27:31.475
Come on! Come on!
In here!

27:31.510 --> 27:33.564
Go, go!

27:33.599 --> 27:35.479
Oh, my God!

27:38.265 --> 27:40.223
What in the world was that?

27:40.258 --> 27:42.312
- What was that?
- I don't know, I don't know.

27:42.347 --> 27:44.706
Did you see them up there?

27:44.741 --> 27:47.230
- Yes, we all saw them.
- Oh, my God.

27:51.104 --> 27:52.226
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

27:52.227 --> 27:53.527
I don't know.

27:55.064 --> 27:59.503
What happened to the truck?
Did they take it?

27:59.538 --> 28:02.332
Okay, okay, we need to talk.
We need to think.

28:02.367 --> 28:03.716
Just breathe, okay?
Just breathe.

28:03.717 --> 28:07.860
- Hornet!
- We don't have Hornet.

28:07.895 --> 28:09.296
We need to think of something.

28:12.038 --> 28:15.476
Hornet was not at camp
when we went to go get him,

28:15.511 --> 28:18.697
which means that's
he's lost in the mountains.

28:18.732 --> 28:21.351
Where could he be?
Where could he be?

28:21.386 --> 28:24.050
Did they...
- Did they what?

28:24.085 --> 28:27.009
I don't know, I don't know.
I think we lost them.

28:27.044 --> 28:28.707
Can we stay here for
a little bit?

28:28.742 --> 28:32.580
Did you see their faces?
They're all messed up!

28:32.615 --> 28:37.150
Something is going on,
an epidemic or something.

28:40.109 --> 28:41.415
What was that?

28:48.291 --> 28:49.849
- Is that them?
- It's gotta be, it's gotta be.

28:49.850 --> 28:51.468
Grab something! Grab something!

28:51.503 --> 28:55.342
- Grab something? What...
- Take this.

28:55.377 --> 28:57.257
They're coming,
they're coming.

29:06.919 --> 29:09.095
Knock, knock, Helen Martin.

29:09.130 --> 29:10.705
Oh, my gosh.

29:10.740 --> 29:12.794
Are you kidding me, Hornet?
- Hornet!

29:12.829 --> 29:14.129
Thank God!

29:16.624 --> 29:19.322
Really?
Get in here, asshole.

29:19.357 --> 29:20.793
- You scared us half to death!
- Faster, faster!

29:20.794 --> 29:22.094
Luke, close the door!

29:22.099 --> 29:23.849
- Sit down.
- Hornet found makers.

29:23.884 --> 29:25.415
Yes! Get in!

29:25.450 --> 29:28.941
Close the doors!
Close the doors!

29:28.976 --> 29:30.725
I did not program you
to be this stupid!

29:30.760 --> 29:32.596
Hornet? Really?
Where were you?

29:32.631 --> 29:34.981
We put you in one spot and
told you to stay right there!

29:34.982 --> 29:36.992
We needed your help!
Why didn't you help us?

29:37.027 --> 29:38.462
Why did you not stay
where I put you?

29:38.463 --> 29:40.996
Did you see anything?
Did you see anything?

29:41.031 --> 29:43.738
Maybe we could use
his recordings?

29:43.773 --> 29:44.729
- Check his recordings!
- Yeah.

29:44.730 --> 29:46.175
GPS?

29:50.223 --> 29:52.791
What is that?

29:52.826 --> 29:56.055
It's the same thing
from the car.

29:56.090 --> 29:57.786
Does that mean they're coming?
What are we doing?

29:57.787 --> 29:59.087
I don't know, I don't know.

30:02.409 --> 30:04.053
Grab the camera,
Helen, grab the camera.

30:04.054 --> 30:05.760
Bring it here.
Come on, hurry.

30:07.718 --> 30:09.546
Oh, my God.

30:12.027 --> 30:14.377
What is that?

30:14.412 --> 30:16.553
Something is going on.
Something awful.

30:16.588 --> 30:18.251
We need to get
out of here now.

30:18.286 --> 30:19.764
That's an alien...
that's an alien ship!

30:19.765 --> 30:21.065
No, it's not, okay?

30:21.071 --> 30:22.376
Get your head on
your shoulders, Chloe.

30:22.377 --> 30:24.083
It's not aliens.
It can't be!

30:24.118 --> 30:25.998
It's gonna to be...
I don't know, military...

30:26.033 --> 30:28.598
It's not military technology.
Never seen anything like that!

30:28.600 --> 30:30.350
Me neither, but
I don't know, okay?

30:30.385 --> 30:32.265
It's not aliens!

30:32.300 --> 30:34.571
There has to be a rational
explanation, you know.

30:34.606 --> 30:37.400
Maybe not military testing,
but, I don't know.

30:37.435 --> 30:40.055
- Okay, who cares?
- Bioweapons? I don't know!

30:40.090 --> 30:43.842
- Danger!
- Yeah, no shit!

30:43.877 --> 30:45.094
Hornet, can your sensors
tell when there's

30:45.095 --> 30:46.801
individuals approaching?

30:46.836 --> 30:49.848
Lifeforms are approaching
100 feet and closing.

30:49.883 --> 30:52.938
90.
- Shh!

30:52.973 --> 30:57.594
Quiet! Quiet!
Quiet!

30:57.629 --> 31:00.032
What do we do?

31:00.067 --> 31:01.860
I don't know,
I don't know.

31:08.997 --> 31:10.297
Shh.

31:16.570 --> 31:17.876
Oh, God.

31:22.184 --> 31:24.360
- Oh my God.
- Shh!

31:27.494 --> 31:28.794
What are they doing?

31:30.627 --> 31:31.927
What are they doing?

31:39.941 --> 31:41.421
What are they doing?

31:43.336 --> 31:45.381
Oh, God.

31:50.082 --> 31:51.910
- Can they see us?
- I don't know.

31:58.003 --> 31:59.961
Can they...

31:59.996 --> 32:01.615
Can...

32:22.984 --> 32:25.160
- Shh!
- Sorry, I'm sorry.

32:30.165 --> 32:31.950
- Oh, my God.
- Shh!

32:31.985 --> 32:33.941
- Can they see me?
- He's looking right at us!

32:36.606 --> 32:38.695
They've stopped.

32:38.730 --> 32:40.306
Can they see us?

32:40.341 --> 32:42.047
Oh, my God,
are they looking at us?

32:46.486 --> 32:48.227
They stopped.

32:52.187 --> 32:53.493
They're leaving.

32:58.585 --> 33:00.021
They're leaving.

33:04.634 --> 33:06.245
Lifeforms dispersed.

33:07.942 --> 33:10.205
Come on, buddy!
Put a sock in it, all right?

33:10.240 --> 33:12.903
We're scared to death here!

33:16.951 --> 33:18.073
- What is that?
- They're back!

33:18.074 --> 33:19.736
Hornet, what is that?

33:22.609 --> 33:24.045
It's just one.
- What do we do?

33:24.080 --> 33:25.167
It's just one.
I don't even care!

33:25.168 --> 33:26.255
We gotta do something!

33:26.256 --> 33:29.094
Luke, no!

33:29.129 --> 33:30.791
- What the hell?
- Get in here!

33:30.826 --> 33:33.359
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
- You? You're still here?

33:33.394 --> 33:34.916
I thought I told you guys
to get outta here!

33:34.917 --> 33:36.536
Hornet, where were you
on that, huh?

33:36.571 --> 33:38.581
Why didn't you tell us
it was him?

33:38.616 --> 33:41.671
You told me to
put a sock in it.

33:41.706 --> 33:44.979
Look, I'm sorry, okay?
Those people out there, they...

33:45.014 --> 33:46.981
And they attacked you. I know.

33:47.016 --> 33:49.017
Look, something crazy is
going on out there, okay?

33:49.018 --> 33:51.681
Dozens of townspeople,
they just coming up missing.

33:51.716 --> 33:53.596
Then they're coming
back crazy.

33:53.631 --> 33:55.642
Look, they killed one
of the other rangers

33:55.677 --> 33:57.165
and they destroyed my vehicle.

33:57.200 --> 33:58.993
Oh, my God.

33:59.028 --> 34:00.734
The mountain isn't safe.

34:00.769 --> 34:02.639
We got to get to a secure
location and call for help.

34:02.640 --> 34:04.651
- Okay.
- I agree.

34:04.686 --> 34:06.034
To preserve life,
we must get out of here

34:06.035 --> 34:08.829
and tell the world of
this phenomenon.

34:08.864 --> 34:11.005
What is that?

34:11.040 --> 34:14.443
What? You've never seen an
Emergency Services Bot before?

34:14.478 --> 34:15.609
You know the way out?

34:15.610 --> 34:17.272
Yeah. Follow me.

34:18.926 --> 34:20.362
- Take this.
- Thank you.

34:20.397 --> 34:23.496
- Hornet, come on!
- Hornet, come on!

34:23.531 --> 34:25.454
Let's move, Hornet!

34:25.489 --> 34:28.283
You know how all this sounds?

34:28.318 --> 34:30.719
I'd say crazy, and it was.

34:30.755 --> 34:33.810
It was seriously crazy.

34:33.844 --> 34:36.422
But you guys would
know that, wouldn't you?

34:36.456 --> 34:38.685
UFOs and aliens
and all that?

34:40.687 --> 34:43.297
- Do we?
- Yeah.

34:43.333 --> 34:46.040
That's not half the secret
that you thought it was.

34:46.074 --> 34:49.826
Come on, we know and
we know that you know.

34:49.860 --> 34:52.699
So what about those
that were attacking you?

34:52.734 --> 34:55.658
What about them?

34:55.693 --> 34:59.053
I don't know.
It was all really confusing.

34:59.088 --> 35:03.101
Look, we didn't hurt anyone that
wasn't trying to hurt us first.

35:04.885 --> 35:06.930
I'm not accusing you of
hurting anyone, yet.

35:08.845 --> 35:13.285
There you go again with
your veiled threats.

35:15.504 --> 35:18.072
No. When I threaten you,
you'll know it.

35:20.379 --> 35:24.339
Harsh.
You're so harsh.

35:24.374 --> 35:28.691
I am what I need to be
in a world filled

35:28.726 --> 35:31.955
with the poor and the useless,
the uncooperative.

35:31.990 --> 35:34.088
I'm cooperating
right now, aren't I?

35:35.872 --> 35:37.439
Supposedly.

35:39.963 --> 35:43.532
Let me ask you a question.

35:43.567 --> 35:45.708
That's not how
it works, Lukey.

35:45.743 --> 35:48.276
I want to know how
something like

35:48.311 --> 35:51.018
that could happen to us
and we got no help at all.

35:51.053 --> 35:53.586
I mean, shit, afterwards
you just locked me up here!

35:55.805 --> 35:59.244
I'd always hoped that the
government were the good guys.

35:59.279 --> 36:03.030
That's not the picture
that I'm getting right now.

36:03.065 --> 36:05.772
You want assurances
that we're on your side?

36:05.807 --> 36:07.329
I just want to know
that there's still good

36:07.330 --> 36:09.732
in this world, yeah.

36:09.767 --> 36:11.942
And that you're not gonna
kill me when this is over.

36:11.943 --> 36:14.259
You keep looking for safety!

36:14.294 --> 36:16.174
You say you saw alien ships

36:16.209 --> 36:19.133
and you were attacked
by warped civilians!

36:19.168 --> 36:22.571
You know, if I were you, I would
be scared shitless right now!

36:22.606 --> 36:24.660
I'd be peeing down my pants!

36:24.695 --> 36:26.401
I'd be so worried
about what was coming,

36:26.436 --> 36:30.188
I wouldn't know what to do!
I would be so scared!

36:32.059 --> 36:34.583
I'm good.
I'm all right.

36:37.195 --> 36:39.849
Really.
I'm good.

36:46.378 --> 36:47.678
You know...

36:49.946 --> 36:53.515
There's one thing
I have learned in life.

36:53.550 --> 36:55.387
You're never really good.

36:58.477 --> 37:02.394
You're alive only
because you're breathing.

37:06.224 --> 37:10.880
And the world is
always trying

37:10.915 --> 37:14.623
to crush you
between each breath.

37:17.278 --> 37:19.846
Mm-mm.
I think you're wrong.

37:24.329 --> 37:29.247
I think I would have
to remind you

37:29.282 --> 37:32.162
of how right I am.

37:34.077 --> 37:35.287
Just let me know
when you're ready.

37:35.288 --> 37:36.588
No!

38:28.654 --> 38:30.873
Hornet,
don't go too far.

38:30.908 --> 38:31.908
Did you see that?
Did you see that?

38:31.909 --> 38:33.528
- Yeah.
- The light.

38:33.563 --> 38:34.998
Yeah, we been seeing them
all over the mountain.

38:34.999 --> 38:36.260
We have no idea
where they're coming from

38:36.261 --> 38:38.098
or what's causing them.

38:38.133 --> 38:40.318
I'm telling you,
it's that ship! It's alien!

38:40.353 --> 38:41.396
Chloe, come on.
It's not plausible!

38:41.397 --> 38:42.929
Yes, it is!

38:42.964 --> 38:44.443
How do you explain
the hordes of crazy people?

38:44.444 --> 38:45.444
There's got to be
a controlling influence!

38:45.445 --> 38:47.237
It could be...

38:47.272 --> 38:48.761
Some drugs like PCP...?

38:48.796 --> 38:50.096
- Yeah.
- No.

38:50.101 --> 38:51.764
Can alter the neurons
in your brain

38:51.799 --> 38:53.539
making you irrational.
- It's not PCP, Helen.

38:53.540 --> 38:54.583
It's not aliens, Chloe.

38:54.584 --> 38:56.334
That ship could be foreign

38:56.369 --> 38:58.379
and those could be
a new form of terrorists?

38:58.414 --> 39:00.807
Okay, well, how do you explain
the light that sucks people up?

39:00.808 --> 39:02.548
There's no tech on earth
that can do that!

39:02.549 --> 39:03.897
Speaking at technology,
you guys have...

39:03.898 --> 39:05.430
Helen, look out! Look out!

39:06.996 --> 39:09.564
- Luke! Luke!
- Helen!

39:11.740 --> 39:15.309
Luke! Luke!

39:15.344 --> 39:17.093
Helen!
- Hey, you guys run!

39:17.128 --> 39:19.922
Helen! Luke! Luke!

39:19.957 --> 39:22.142
Go! Luke, get up!
Get up!

39:22.177 --> 39:23.351
Come on!

39:23.352 --> 39:24.884
Get up!

39:24.919 --> 39:27.539
Get the fuck out of my way!
Crazy bitches!

39:27.574 --> 39:28.888
Wait, the ranger!

39:28.923 --> 39:31.804
Is he okay?
Is he okay?

39:31.839 --> 39:34.241
Hornet, what the
hell was that?

39:34.276 --> 39:36.112
What the fuck is going on?

39:41.466 --> 39:42.762
We can't just leave him!

39:42.763 --> 39:44.730
He was
buying us time, come on!

39:44.765 --> 39:46.775
He's the only one that
knows the way out!

39:46.810 --> 39:49.996
Hornet was built for
crisis aid and rescue.

39:50.031 --> 39:51.476
I think he can manage.

39:51.511 --> 39:52.912
Lead the way, Hornet.

39:52.947 --> 39:54.295
Hornet can't!
Are you kidding me?

39:54.296 --> 39:55.741
What's he gonna do?

39:55.776 --> 39:57.471
Look, that park ranger
is probably dead.

39:57.473 --> 39:59.484
And him?
He just stood there!

39:59.519 --> 40:01.224
He's shown adaptive skills,

40:01.259 --> 40:02.521
but this is not something
that we programmed into him!

40:02.522 --> 40:04.053
Guys, be quiet!

40:04.088 --> 40:05.524
Helen, this isn't
a field test anymore!

40:05.525 --> 40:06.969
Quiet!

40:07.004 --> 40:08.744
Those things are still
human and technically

40:08.745 --> 40:11.365
he cannot still
hurt humans, okay?

40:11.400 --> 40:13.541
If we want a fighting chance,
I think we have to

40:13.576 --> 40:17.066
reprogram Hornet's
code parameters, okay?

40:17.101 --> 40:18.493
- Can we do that?
- Let's do that, yes.

40:18.494 --> 40:20.026
Okay.

40:21.723 --> 40:23.986
Find a spot to set you down.

40:24.021 --> 40:25.901
Shit.

40:25.936 --> 40:27.236
Thanks.

40:50.578 --> 40:52.275
Thank you for waiting,
Miss Martin.

40:53.755 --> 40:56.541
What was that noise?

40:56.576 --> 40:58.978
You guys torturing people?

40:59.013 --> 41:01.850
What if I said yes?

41:01.885 --> 41:04.636
What kind of people are you?

41:04.671 --> 41:05.971
We're the good guys.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.206
No.

41:10.241 --> 41:13.601
I'm not saying anything
until I speak to my lawyer.

41:13.636 --> 41:16.865
Well, that won't be possible.

41:16.900 --> 41:19.999
I'm not saying another word
until I speak to my lawyer.

41:22.654 --> 41:24.873
You people and your lawyers.

41:27.441 --> 41:32.533
Let's say we're in a magic land
where lawyers don't exist.

41:32.568 --> 41:36.450
You act like this
is some kind of game.

41:36.485 --> 41:39.584
Well, if it were,
we're in a new round.

41:39.619 --> 41:43.936
You see, we can't torture him
forever or he'll die on us.

41:43.971 --> 41:47.548
So we give him a few minutes
before we start again.

41:49.028 --> 41:51.247
You're sick.

41:51.282 --> 41:52.761
Yeah, people have said
that sometimes,

41:52.762 --> 41:55.513
but I really don't see
what it means.

41:57.384 --> 42:00.082
I serve
a function, Miss Martin.

42:00.117 --> 42:03.346
You do understand
that, right?

42:03.381 --> 42:05.479
I mean, you're a tech genius.

42:05.514 --> 42:09.875
You build machines
that serve functions.

42:09.910 --> 42:13.356
So in effect,

42:13.391 --> 42:15.054
that's your own function.

42:15.089 --> 42:17.883
I'm not a robot.

42:17.918 --> 42:21.060
I have a family.
I have friends.

42:21.095 --> 42:24.106
I'm not some code
in a program.

42:24.141 --> 42:28.633
I have people who love me,
who will come looking for me.

42:28.668 --> 42:30.983
Well, they won't
find you

42:31.018 --> 42:32.365
unless I want them to find you.

42:34.508 --> 42:37.598
I'm wondering why you haven't
asked me what my function is.

42:37.633 --> 42:39.295
I don't care.

42:39.330 --> 42:41.243
I just want my friends
and I want to go home.

42:42.995 --> 42:44.823
My function, Miss Martin...

42:48.391 --> 42:54.006
is to take every bit
of information from you,

42:54.041 --> 42:56.617
your friends, the professor

42:56.652 --> 43:00.447
and this robot of yours,
this Hornet.

43:00.482 --> 43:04.364
And dissect the links
between you

43:04.399 --> 43:08.934
and the events that
happened on the mountain.

43:08.969 --> 43:11.403
And what do you know about
what happened on the mountain?

43:12.851 --> 43:15.244
I know you're a
lot more responsible

43:15.279 --> 43:17.507
than you're willing to admit.

43:17.542 --> 43:19.031
What's that supposed to mean?

43:22.338 --> 43:25.124
Let's just say
we're both on

43:25.159 --> 43:27.605
a journey of discovery,
Miss Martin.

43:29.694 --> 43:32.914
But your price

43:32.949 --> 43:35.700
may be a heavy one to pay.

43:44.796 --> 43:47.494
Does that voice
sound familiar?

43:47.529 --> 43:49.452
No, you wouldn't...

43:50.584 --> 43:51.884
Luke?

43:53.195 --> 43:57.373
Yes, that is him.

43:57.408 --> 43:59.549
He's told me some of the story.

43:59.584 --> 44:01.377
But why don't you
bring me up to speed?

44:04.032 --> 44:08.254
If you cooperate,
I could stop this procedure.

44:11.518 --> 44:13.433
So do we have a deal?
- Yes, we have a deal.

44:13.468 --> 44:15.478
Please, will you
stop hurting him?

44:24.487 --> 44:26.968
Yes.

44:27.003 --> 44:28.303
Hold.

44:36.064 --> 44:40.590
So, why don't you pick it up
from where he left off?

44:42.592 --> 44:43.892
Where was that exactly?

44:47.859 --> 44:49.208
Hornet afraid.

44:49.243 --> 44:51.471
Really assuring.
You're afraid?

44:51.506 --> 44:53.865
Can it even do that?
- I guess so.

44:53.900 --> 44:57.085
It's okay, buddy.
Okay, you're both connected.

44:57.120 --> 44:59.479
All right, almost got it.

44:59.514 --> 45:00.959
Whatever you're doing,
hurry up.

45:00.994 --> 45:02.438
I'm starting to hear things.

45:02.473 --> 45:04.039
Yeah, I'm going as fast
as I can, okay?

45:04.040 --> 45:05.833
Okay.

45:05.868 --> 45:07.313
Got it?

45:07.348 --> 45:10.446
Almost got it, almost got it,
almost got it.

45:10.481 --> 45:12.274
- Come on!
- I got it, I got it!

45:12.309 --> 45:13.841
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

45:13.876 --> 45:15.930
- You sure it's gonna work?
- No.

45:15.965 --> 45:18.628
Hornet, what's
your primary directive?

45:21.153 --> 45:23.285
- Chloe, look out!
- Ah!

45:30.597 --> 45:32.468
Protect makers.

45:32.503 --> 45:33.992
It worked!

45:34.027 --> 45:35.471
I guess so!

45:35.506 --> 45:39.911
- Hornet, that was awesome!
- Oh, my God!

45:39.946 --> 45:41.477
Perfect.

45:41.512 --> 45:42.861
I don't know.
Let's get outta here.

45:42.862 --> 45:44.263
Yeah.

45:44.298 --> 45:45.743
Oh, my gosh!
Tell me we got that!

45:45.778 --> 45:47.353
That was incredible!

45:50.530 --> 45:53.751
Guys?

45:53.786 --> 45:55.274
Where'd they go?

45:55.309 --> 45:57.667
- Oh, my God.
- Where'd they go?

45:57.702 --> 45:59.539
I don't know.

45:59.574 --> 46:01.617
That means they'll probably
be back, won't they?

46:01.619 --> 46:04.413
Yeah, most definitely.

46:05.545 --> 46:07.677
Then we'll be ready.

46:07.712 --> 46:09.767
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

46:09.802 --> 46:11.102
We gotta get outta here.

46:17.122 --> 46:19.951
You guys sure this
is still a good idea?

46:19.986 --> 46:23.563
- Probably not.
- God, I hope so.

46:23.598 --> 46:27.697
Hey! A bunch of fresh idiots!
Come on! Come and get us!

46:29.525 --> 46:31.658
- What are they doing?
- I don't know.

46:31.693 --> 46:33.433
- They're just standing there.
- They're just standing there.

46:33.434 --> 46:34.825
Why are they
just standing there?

46:37.185 --> 46:38.708
What are they gonna do?

46:38.743 --> 46:40.188
Luke, look out!

46:41.581 --> 46:43.626
Get them off of me!

46:43.661 --> 46:45.411
Chloe!

46:45.446 --> 46:47.805
Hey, get off! Get off!

46:47.840 --> 46:49.371
Camera, camera.

46:49.406 --> 46:51.112
Come on!
Come on, come on!

46:51.147 --> 46:52.810
Hornet, come on!
- Come on, Hornet!

47:04.169 --> 47:06.649
We gotta go! We gotta go!
We gotta go!

47:06.684 --> 47:07.984
Go, go, go!

47:14.222 --> 47:15.522
Luke?

47:17.356 --> 47:19.271
Luke, wake up.
- Hmm?

47:24.406 --> 47:27.061
Now you have a pretty high
tolerance for a civilian.

47:29.194 --> 47:31.979
Tolerance?

47:32.014 --> 47:34.808
Torture.

47:34.843 --> 47:36.766
You could make
a good agent someday.

47:38.986 --> 47:40.683
That's not my bag.

47:42.947 --> 47:46.298
How can you just sit there
and do this to me?

47:48.691 --> 47:50.258
It's my job.
It's what I have to do.

48:07.754 --> 48:11.627
Come on.
A little help, please?

48:11.662 --> 48:12.962
Please?

48:14.848 --> 48:16.502
You think I'm cruel?

48:29.645 --> 48:31.386
Is that a trick question?

48:35.129 --> 48:37.218
I can be your best friend

48:38.698 --> 48:41.048
or your worst nightmare.

48:41.083 --> 48:42.383
The choice is yours.

48:46.749 --> 48:48.055
What you want from me?

48:49.970 --> 48:52.973
How long have we been running?
Will Hornet be able to find us?

48:53.008 --> 48:54.670
He'll catch up with us.

48:54.705 --> 48:56.271
Why won't those things
just stay down?

48:56.272 --> 48:58.979
Keep moving!

49:00.328 --> 49:02.069
Ranger?

49:02.104 --> 49:04.376
You're alive?

49:04.411 --> 49:06.944
For now, but it
hasn't been easy.

49:06.979 --> 49:10.034
Look, the hills are crawling
with these things!

49:10.069 --> 49:11.330
We can't talk.

49:11.331 --> 49:13.167
If you can walk,
we need to keep moving.

49:13.202 --> 49:14.681
Come on. Here, here.
Come on, let's go.

49:14.682 --> 49:15.982
Come on.

49:18.303 --> 49:20.042
What are you doing? Come on!
We gotta go!

49:22.481 --> 49:24.135
What are you doing?

49:26.789 --> 49:31.098
Must protect makers.

49:31.133 --> 49:33.144
What do you want?

49:33.179 --> 49:34.493
To play!

49:40.020 --> 49:42.805
- Must protect...
- What is that?

49:42.840 --> 49:45.025
- What are you doing to him?
- Protect...

49:45.060 --> 49:47.288
Let him go, you bastard!

49:47.323 --> 49:51.858
- ... tect... protect...
- Get away

49:51.893 --> 49:53.338
Hornet!
Are you okay, Hornet?

49:53.373 --> 49:54.992
You okay, buddy?

49:57.342 --> 49:59.953
Now! Time to run!

49:59.988 --> 50:02.521
Hornet, what's your
primary objective?

50:04.740 --> 50:07.221
- No, Hornet!
- Helen!

50:07.256 --> 50:09.484
Stop!

50:18.145 --> 50:20.104
- No, Chloe!
- Chloe!

50:23.194 --> 50:24.494
Hornet, over here!

50:28.199 --> 50:29.499
Get up! Come on.
We gotta go!

50:32.246 --> 50:34.292
Come on, we gotta go!
We gotta go!

50:36.946 --> 50:38.687
Keep moving!

50:44.215 --> 50:45.651
- Go!
- We're trying.

50:45.686 --> 50:48.480
- I can't breathe.
- Chloe, careful.

50:48.515 --> 50:50.786
Hold on!

50:50.821 --> 50:52.571
- Get down, get down!
- Get down.

50:53.876 --> 50:56.662
Shh.

50:56.697 --> 50:58.272
Shh...

51:08.065 --> 51:09.544
Oh, God.

51:13.896 --> 51:15.985
Did we lose him?

51:16.020 --> 51:17.378
I think so.

51:17.413 --> 51:18.713
For now.

51:21.817 --> 51:24.385
Oh, we gotta keep going.

51:24.420 --> 51:26.909
Come on, guys.
We gotta keep moving.

51:26.944 --> 51:29.042
Hold on.
One, two...

51:29.077 --> 51:30.478
Chloe, come on.

51:33.394 --> 51:35.527
You can do it, girl.
Come on.

51:35.562 --> 51:38.095
- No, I can't!
- Chloe!

51:48.279 --> 51:50.629
He was pulled up
by those lights.

51:52.587 --> 51:55.460
He'll be back, yes.
Yes, I'm serious.

51:55.495 --> 51:59.333
What's wrong with him?
Why'd he attack us?

52:00.334 --> 52:01.683
Those lights.

52:01.718 --> 52:03.154
I think they're
doing something to him,

52:03.155 --> 52:05.078
maybe reprogramming him.

52:05.113 --> 52:08.168
Spit it out.

52:08.203 --> 52:10.910
I want to know about
Hornet's origins.

52:10.945 --> 52:12.245
Origin?

52:12.251 --> 52:14.043
Yes. Who designed him?
Who planned him?

52:14.078 --> 52:16.655
I told you.

52:16.690 --> 52:20.267
The professor planned,
maybe Helen helped.

52:20.302 --> 52:22.530
I just built him.

52:26.665 --> 52:30.843
I believe you're
feigning ignorance.

52:33.672 --> 52:36.370
I'm gonna be honest with you.

52:36.405 --> 52:39.852
You're one crazy son of a bitch.

52:41.810 --> 52:43.377
I have no idea
what's going on

52:43.412 --> 52:46.815
inside of that crazy-ass
head of yours.

52:46.850 --> 52:49.992
You can insult me
all you want,

52:50.027 --> 52:53.561
but it won't get you Helen
and it won't get you Chloe.

52:55.868 --> 52:57.609
That's if they're
even alive, right?

52:58.914 --> 53:01.134
What if they are?

53:01.169 --> 53:04.790
Then you better not be hurting
them like you're hurting me.

53:04.825 --> 53:07.532
Because if you are,
I'll kill you.

53:07.567 --> 53:10.099
Mark my words.

53:10.134 --> 53:12.537
You want one shot
at seeing them again,

53:12.572 --> 53:16.018
tell me where Hornet came from.

53:16.053 --> 53:19.848
I told you.
We just built him.

53:19.883 --> 53:22.808
Not all of him.

53:22.843 --> 53:25.637
Tech like that
can't be developed

53:25.672 --> 53:28.814
by three college kids and
an absentminded professor.

53:28.849 --> 53:30.555
No, no, no.

53:30.590 --> 53:33.949
Some of those parts
you didn't build yourself!

53:35.124 --> 53:39.041
They must have been alien.

53:40.129 --> 53:41.870
Aliens?

53:41.905 --> 53:45.657
Yes, non-human origin?

53:47.615 --> 53:50.662
Aliens don't exist.

53:50.697 --> 53:52.219
Well, then what about
this wild story

53:52.220 --> 53:54.796
you've been telling me?

53:54.831 --> 53:58.017
How do I know
this isn't yours?

53:58.052 --> 54:00.889
Some government aircraft, huh?

54:00.924 --> 54:04.153
Well, if they did exist,
they're not ours.

54:04.188 --> 54:06.199
How can I be sure?

54:06.234 --> 54:11.248
You've been messing with me
since I got in here.

54:11.283 --> 54:15.077
They could be
Russian, Chinese...

54:15.112 --> 54:18.820
Maybe we could solve this
if you just told me

54:18.855 --> 54:20.605
where Hornet's parts came from.

54:20.640 --> 54:21.997
Hornet's parts?

54:22.032 --> 54:24.217
Yes.

54:24.252 --> 54:27.133
Okay. You're right.

54:27.168 --> 54:29.831
I been holding back
this whole time.

54:29.866 --> 54:31.877
I think it's time I told you.

54:35.881 --> 54:38.013
You ready?
- Yes.

54:38.048 --> 54:40.886
Okay.

54:40.921 --> 54:45.238
Yeah, they...
they came in these...

54:45.273 --> 54:48.763
these huge cardboard boxes.

54:49.982 --> 54:53.159
It was crazy.

54:53.194 --> 54:56.554
They were U.S. postage stamped,

54:56.589 --> 54:59.687
FedEx delivered,
mindblown.

55:01.907 --> 55:03.256
You think you're funny?

55:03.291 --> 55:06.564
Yeah.

55:06.599 --> 55:11.264
And I've been telling you
the truth this whole time.

55:12.744 --> 55:15.616
Hey, hey, how you doing?

55:18.140 --> 55:19.751
It's okay, it's okay.

55:19.786 --> 55:22.319
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

55:24.843 --> 55:26.584
Oh, my goodness.

55:29.500 --> 55:31.110
It's okay.

55:31.145 --> 55:32.633
Oh, my God.

55:35.157 --> 55:36.942
I think you broke some ribs.

55:38.639 --> 55:41.729
Okay, breathe, breathe, breathe.

55:46.647 --> 55:47.900
What about you?

55:47.901 --> 55:50.651
Ow, God, come on!

55:50.686 --> 55:52.827
I think it's dislocated.
Come on.

55:52.862 --> 55:55.090
Stop it. You're not much
use to me with a gimpy arm.

55:55.125 --> 55:57.310
Oh!

55:57.345 --> 56:00.226
Helen, I hate you.
- I know. It's okay.

56:00.261 --> 56:02.010
Oh, my gosh.

56:02.045 --> 56:04.883
You're okay, you're okay.
Breathe, breathe.

56:04.918 --> 56:06.580
- Breathe.
- Breathe.

56:11.106 --> 56:13.413
I hate camping.

56:14.675 --> 56:17.112
We're okay, we're okay.

56:17.147 --> 56:20.420
You remember when coming
into the woods was a great idea?

56:22.596 --> 56:25.947
We should never
leave the lab.

56:25.982 --> 56:28.123
But we...
But we...

56:28.158 --> 56:31.039
We stole all of our
Professor's stuff.

56:31.074 --> 56:35.435
He's gonna be pissed.

56:35.470 --> 56:37.394
He's gonna be so mad.

56:40.266 --> 56:42.877
Breathe.
We're okay.

56:42.912 --> 56:44.738
You think we could stay
here for the night?

56:44.740 --> 56:47.404
We don't really have a choice.

56:47.439 --> 56:50.711
We have no choice.
- Think we'll die here?

56:50.746 --> 56:52.583
- Mm-hmm.
- I don't know.

56:52.618 --> 56:56.630
I don't believe in aliens
or government conspiracies!

56:56.665 --> 57:00.808
All I know is what
I saw on that mountain.

57:00.843 --> 57:03.681
All right,
let's talk about that.

57:03.716 --> 57:06.248
What happened after
you reprogrammed Hornet

57:06.283 --> 57:08.250
to defend you
against those Sleepers?

57:10.165 --> 57:11.515
I didn't tell you that.

57:14.082 --> 57:16.955
Chloe? Helen?
Did they tell you?

57:16.990 --> 57:19.392
Maybe.

57:19.427 --> 57:22.134
Tell me more and
maybe you'll be reunited.

57:22.169 --> 57:23.744
Maybe?

57:23.779 --> 57:25.529
Well, nothing's guaranteed.

57:25.564 --> 57:27.661
I fucking hate you.

57:31.535 --> 57:35.713
Well, then I am doing my job.

57:39.891 --> 57:41.283
So what happened next?

57:49.204 --> 57:52.556
- How does it feel?
- How does it look?

57:54.949 --> 57:56.429
Ah!

57:59.824 --> 58:01.120
Like hell?

58:01.121 --> 58:02.479
There you go.

58:15.317 --> 58:19.147
I don't know
who's gonna see this recording

58:19.182 --> 58:23.021
or if anyone's gonna see this.

58:23.056 --> 58:26.024
But...

58:26.059 --> 58:28.940
It's the job
of a scientist to document.

58:30.463 --> 58:32.987
And in these extreme conditions,

58:34.641 --> 58:36.121
it's what I know to do.

58:38.602 --> 58:42.257
Hornet has gone rogue,

58:42.292 --> 58:45.783
reprogrammed by
whatever force

58:45.818 --> 58:48.481
is behind the attacks
in the woods.

58:49.743 --> 58:51.353
And...

58:53.791 --> 58:57.664
While running away
from our creation,

58:57.699 --> 59:01.146
we got lost deeper
into the woods.

59:01.181 --> 59:04.932
And without Hornet's
advanced technology,

59:06.455 --> 59:07.755
we're lost.

59:10.198 --> 59:15.464
Chloe is hurt bad

59:15.499 --> 59:18.119
and now...

59:18.154 --> 59:21.993
we just need to make it

59:22.028 --> 59:25.257
down out of the
mountain safely.

59:27.128 --> 59:30.523
Honestly, that was
the goal the whole time.

59:30.558 --> 59:33.439
I was just too
stubborn to listen.

59:34.875 --> 59:37.748
Helen, you can't
think that way.

59:37.783 --> 59:42.535
No, Chloe, it was my idea
to push the experiment,

59:42.570 --> 59:45.320
to push you.

59:45.355 --> 59:46.800
I'm selfish.

59:46.835 --> 59:48.628
You wanted
to change the world.

59:48.663 --> 59:50.195
That's not selfish.

59:50.230 --> 59:51.718
Yeah, okay?

59:51.753 --> 59:54.591
It's not on you.
It's on all of us.

59:54.626 --> 59:59.683
We built Hornet together,
we came out here together.

59:59.718 --> 01:00:01.293
And we believed in this project.

01:00:01.328 --> 01:00:02.628
Still believe.

01:00:04.296 --> 01:00:05.602
Still believe.

01:00:07.516 --> 01:00:08.909
Still believe.

01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:14.785
Yet, we couldn't
even stop him

01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:16.700
from getting into
the wrong hands.

01:00:17.918 --> 01:00:20.791
Aliens. What are you gonna do?

01:00:23.402 --> 01:00:26.971
Keep thinking about
that Ranger's face.

01:00:27.006 --> 01:00:29.582
He's one of them.

01:00:29.617 --> 01:00:32.454
At this rate,
it could spread everywhere.

01:00:32.489 --> 01:00:36.894
Yeah, but we're not gonna
let that happen, robot or no.

01:00:40.898 --> 01:00:42.639
I don't know if you
guys have noticed,

01:00:42.674 --> 01:00:44.597
but I'm not really in
a particular condition

01:00:44.632 --> 01:00:46.643
for quick escape right now.

01:00:46.678 --> 01:00:49.384
And the chances of
survival at night are slim.

01:00:49.419 --> 01:00:51.735
Yeah. I don't like knowing
the odds, okay?

01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:55.216
It's more like statistics,
so figured you'd want to know.

01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:58.567
I figured, as a scientist,
you'd appreciate that.

01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:06.663
Just give me a minute.

01:01:07.794 --> 01:01:09.094
Yeah, sure.

01:01:26.378 --> 01:01:27.684
How long?

01:01:27.719 --> 01:01:29.076
How long what?

01:01:29.111 --> 01:01:30.730
You know
what I'm talking about.

01:01:32.036 --> 01:01:35.082
Not long.

01:01:35.117 --> 01:01:38.085
We can get her through
the next few hours,

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:41.132
but we need to get
her some medical help.

01:01:42.829 --> 01:01:45.614
So you lost your prize toy.

01:01:45.649 --> 01:01:47.225
That must have been hard.

01:01:50.619 --> 01:01:54.101
I didn't even care about that.

01:01:54.136 --> 01:01:57.235
Chloe was hurt, maybe dying.

01:01:57.270 --> 01:02:00.107
Is she dead?

01:02:00.142 --> 01:02:01.979
You keep asking about her.

01:02:02.014 --> 01:02:03.763
Is there some kind of
special affection...

01:02:03.798 --> 01:02:05.896
Just answer the damn question!

01:02:05.931 --> 01:02:07.549
Is she dead or not?

01:02:07.584 --> 01:02:08.933
No, I can see that
this is important to you,

01:02:08.934 --> 01:02:11.075
but we're not
through here yet.

01:02:11.110 --> 01:02:14.078
What does that have
to do with anything?

01:02:14.113 --> 01:02:17.603
Look, you never thought
it strange that

01:02:17.638 --> 01:02:20.258
Hornet could be reprogrammed
so easily?

01:02:20.293 --> 01:02:21.738
So now you believe me?

01:02:24.828 --> 01:02:28.048
Let's say, yes,
I believe you.

01:02:28.083 --> 01:02:32.749
But did it ever occur to
you that these flying ships

01:02:32.784 --> 01:02:35.186
could reprogram
your precious friend?

01:02:35.221 --> 01:02:38.537
Yeah, sure.
It was strange.

01:02:38.572 --> 01:02:40.844
A lot of strange things
happened that day.

01:02:40.879 --> 01:02:45.022
Call it a cherry on
top of the shit sundae.

01:02:45.057 --> 01:02:48.721
Look, our robot got hijacked
and we were screwed.

01:02:48.756 --> 01:02:51.202
And it never made you
question the origins

01:02:51.237 --> 01:02:52.367
of your robot companion?

01:02:52.368 --> 01:02:54.858
Why would it?

01:02:54.893 --> 01:02:56.773
Come on, Luke.

01:03:00.515 --> 01:03:03.388
You must have known
that something was off.

01:03:03.423 --> 01:03:07.305
I mean, that your friends
weren't telling you everything.

01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:09.307
You're not that stupid!

01:03:09.342 --> 01:03:10.699
What are you talking about?

01:03:14.965 --> 01:03:18.316
Bring in the girl.

01:03:18.351 --> 01:03:19.651
The girl?

01:03:21.188 --> 01:03:22.929
Chloe?

01:03:22.964 --> 01:03:24.626
Helen?

01:03:24.661 --> 01:03:25.961
What are you doing to her?

01:03:28.021 --> 01:03:29.501
Don't you put a hand on her!

01:03:29.536 --> 01:03:30.836
Chloe!

01:03:32.373 --> 01:03:36.290
So, Miss Martin,
what didn't you tell Luke?

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:41.078
What didn't I tell him?

01:03:41.113 --> 01:03:42.993
About the tests.

01:03:43.028 --> 01:03:44.328
About Hornet?

01:03:46.518 --> 01:03:49.477
What did you keep from Luke
that almost cost him his life?

01:03:49.512 --> 01:03:51.349
Luke, don't listen to him.

01:03:51.384 --> 01:03:56.136
Now you'll hear all the way
she played you for a fool.

01:03:56.171 --> 01:03:59.400
We gotta go... now.

01:03:59.435 --> 01:04:01.054
All right.
Well, let's move.

01:04:01.089 --> 01:04:02.708
You guys know
I can hear you, right?

01:04:02.743 --> 01:04:05.450
Chloe, I'm sorry.

01:04:05.485 --> 01:04:09.062
We didn't mean for you to...

01:04:09.097 --> 01:04:12.196
Pretty good with facts
and figures, so...

01:04:12.231 --> 01:04:14.198
Look, Chloe,
we're gonna do everything

01:04:14.233 --> 01:04:16.591
that we can to get you
out of here, okay?

01:04:16.626 --> 01:04:18.506
Well, you better.

01:04:18.541 --> 01:04:20.238
I want to see the look on
the professor's face

01:04:20.239 --> 01:04:22.162
when you tell him about
the frickin' robot.

01:04:24.991 --> 01:04:26.291
Yeah, we did...

01:04:31.824 --> 01:04:35.219
What if they come back, huh?

01:04:35.254 --> 01:04:38.135
We don't have Hornet with
us this time to warn us.

01:04:38.170 --> 01:04:42.922
Honestly, it's Hornet that
I'm the most worried about.

01:04:46.317 --> 01:04:50.799
I mean, you guys
just have to leave me.

01:04:50.834 --> 01:04:52.192
- What?
- What?

01:04:52.227 --> 01:04:53.628
- No way!
- Don't be stupid.

01:04:53.663 --> 01:04:55.108
I wouldn't want
to slow you down.

01:04:55.143 --> 01:04:56.535
You're not gonna
slow us down, Chloe.

01:04:56.536 --> 01:04:59.112
- Chloe...
- It was your project anyway.

01:04:59.147 --> 01:05:02.637
- No, it's our project.
- Your research,

01:05:02.672 --> 01:05:04.195
it's much more important
that you get back

01:05:04.196 --> 01:05:05.370
and tell everybody
what's happened.

01:05:05.371 --> 01:05:10.471
Stop it, Chloe!
I need you.

01:05:10.506 --> 01:05:12.821
I may push you, but I am

01:05:12.856 --> 01:05:16.869
nothing without you, okay?

01:05:16.904 --> 01:05:18.436
We're not going anywhere.

01:05:22.527 --> 01:05:24.398
Always have to have it
your way, huh?

01:05:24.433 --> 01:05:25.747
Yeah.

01:05:27.227 --> 01:05:29.229
It's gonna be a long night.

01:05:29.264 --> 01:05:31.318
Yeah, guys, and...

01:05:34.452 --> 01:05:35.757
I'm sorry to say this,

01:05:35.792 --> 01:05:37.934
but I think
we should power down.

01:05:37.969 --> 01:05:41.502
Save our battery overnight?

01:05:41.537 --> 01:05:43.765
Yeah, I know.
You're right.

01:05:45.202 --> 01:05:47.117
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

01:05:49.336 --> 01:05:50.636
Here.

01:05:52.383 --> 01:05:56.604
I'm Helen Martin once
again signing off.

01:05:58.606 --> 01:05:59.906
Wish us luck.

01:06:08.529 --> 01:06:10.357
I think I saw
him flying, guys.

01:06:10.392 --> 01:06:12.490
I can't believe it.

01:06:12.525 --> 01:06:14.405
He's not gonna give up.

01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:16.798
Come on.
We gotta keep moving.

01:06:18.931 --> 01:06:22.282
We keep hearing things.
I think they're out...

01:06:22.317 --> 01:06:24.545
Shit! It's him!

01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:26.983
Helen, take Chloe now!

01:06:27.018 --> 01:06:29.768
Take her! Go!
Run! Run!

01:06:29.803 --> 01:06:32.205
He's right on top of us!
Keep going!

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:34.991
- Where is that?
- Get it up for me!

01:06:35.026 --> 01:06:36.949
Move, move, move, move!

01:06:36.984 --> 01:06:38.245
He's coming!

01:06:38.246 --> 01:06:39.604
I don't know where this goes!

01:06:39.639 --> 01:06:41.388
I don't care!
Do you wanna switch?

01:06:41.423 --> 01:06:42.781
Run!

01:06:42.816 --> 01:06:44.217
He's gaining on me!

01:06:57.013 --> 01:06:58.623
He's gaining!

01:06:58.658 --> 01:07:02.627
Hornet, what?

01:07:27.086 --> 01:07:28.740
He's gaining on me!

01:07:35.007 --> 01:07:36.443
I don't know where to go!

01:07:40.708 --> 01:07:43.668
Move, move, move!
Guys, come on!

01:07:43.703 --> 01:07:46.192
Keep moving! Keep going!

01:07:46.227 --> 01:07:48.977
Oh, shit!
Come on, keep going, keep going!

01:07:49.012 --> 01:07:50.805
Hey, come on, guys!

01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:52.677
He's gaining.

01:07:52.712 --> 01:07:54.113
Move, move, move, move, move!

01:08:08.693 --> 01:08:09.998
It hurts.

01:08:10.033 --> 01:08:11.333
Let's go.

01:08:14.829 --> 01:08:17.615
Guys? Guys?

01:08:17.649 --> 01:08:20.270
He's stuck!

01:08:20.305 --> 01:08:21.618
We got him!

01:08:21.654 --> 01:08:23.490
We got you, you bastard!

01:08:23.524 --> 01:08:24.825
Whoa!

01:08:28.756 --> 01:08:30.541
Why are you
doing this, Hornet?

01:08:38.287 --> 01:08:40.420
Look what you're doing to us!

01:08:43.292 --> 01:08:44.545
- It's us.
- Eliminate

01:08:44.546 --> 01:08:47.470
biological infestation.

01:08:47.506 --> 01:08:49.081
Eradicate all targets.

01:08:49.116 --> 01:08:51.301
Destroy! Destroy!

01:08:52.432 --> 01:08:56.131
Destroy! Destroy!

01:08:58.002 --> 01:09:00.527
He's not listening, okay?

01:09:00.562 --> 01:09:03.791
- We gotta leave.
- Eradicate all targets.

01:09:03.826 --> 01:09:09.826
Destroy! Destroy!

01:09:10.224 --> 01:09:11.973
Keep moving,
keep moving.

01:09:12.008 --> 01:09:13.758
Eliminate
biological infestation.

01:09:19.285 --> 01:09:23.158
Come on, Chloe, come on.

01:09:23.194 --> 01:09:24.716
We'll find somewhere
to sit down, okay?

01:09:24.716 --> 01:09:29.774
Come on.
Luke, come on, come on.

01:09:29.809 --> 01:09:31.819
How long is this cave?

01:09:31.854 --> 01:09:33.778
Over here, over here.

01:09:33.813 --> 01:09:36.563
Sit down, sit down.

01:09:36.598 --> 01:09:38.261
Chloe, come on.

01:09:40.479 --> 01:09:43.135
I think we're clear.

01:09:43.170 --> 01:09:45.484
Yeah, for now.

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:47.747
For how long?

01:09:47.783 --> 01:09:49.305
You guys should know
the answer to that.

01:09:49.307 --> 01:09:52.796
You built him.
- We built him.

01:09:52.832 --> 01:09:54.131
Right.

01:09:57.236 --> 01:09:59.412
All right, guys.

01:09:59.447 --> 01:10:01.240
Any thoughts, theories?

01:10:01.275 --> 01:10:02.937
We got to think of something

01:10:02.972 --> 01:10:05.592
now that we've this robot
from hell chasing us.

01:10:05.627 --> 01:10:10.118
Really playing scientist
students right now.

01:10:10.153 --> 01:10:12.164
Come on, Chloe, it's
what we do best, right?

01:10:15.036 --> 01:10:20.172
- Right.
- Well, we gotta do something.

01:10:20.207 --> 01:10:22.957
All right.
Well, what have we got?

01:10:22.992 --> 01:10:25.221
I don't know.

01:10:25.256 --> 01:10:27.832
This one is beyond me.

01:10:35.970 --> 01:10:38.190
Guys, you feel that?

01:10:38.225 --> 01:10:39.887
What?

01:10:39.922 --> 01:10:41.454
It's wind, it's wind.

01:10:43.326 --> 01:10:44.849
It's coming from over there.

01:10:46.677 --> 01:10:48.940
Guys, I feel it.
It's coming from over there.

01:10:48.975 --> 01:10:50.855
Good job.

01:10:52.857 --> 01:10:53.892
All right, there's got
to be a way out.

01:10:53.893 --> 01:10:55.642
Come on.
- Okay.

01:10:55.677 --> 01:10:57.763
Look, I'm sorry, Chloe,
but we gotta keep moving.

01:10:59.167 --> 01:11:00.778
Here.

01:11:01.866 --> 01:11:04.477
Get up. Come on.

01:11:04.512 --> 01:11:06.871
Here. Come on.
I'm sorry. Ready?

01:11:06.906 --> 01:11:08.307
One, two, three...

01:11:10.353 --> 01:11:12.877
Come on, come on.

01:11:14.182 --> 01:11:15.793
Helen?

01:11:15.828 --> 01:11:18.361
You keep a look out for Hornet.

01:11:18.396 --> 01:11:20.014
Let's keep moving.

01:11:20.049 --> 01:11:21.223
I'm looking.
I think we lost him.

01:11:21.224 --> 01:11:22.524
Okay.

01:11:23.191 --> 01:11:25.237
No! No! The light!

01:11:25.272 --> 01:11:28.109
Come on, Chloe!

01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:32.070
Come on, come on!
Guys, come on!

01:11:35.247 --> 01:11:37.118
It's caving in!

01:11:37.153 --> 01:11:39.033
Come on, guys!

01:11:39.068 --> 01:11:40.112
He's gaining.

01:11:40.113 --> 01:11:42.254
Run!

01:11:42.289 --> 01:11:45.257
It's caving in.
Go on!

01:11:45.292 --> 01:11:46.248
Keep moving,
keep moving, keep moving.

01:11:46.249 --> 01:11:47.549
Come on, Chloe! Come on!

01:11:47.555 --> 01:11:49.479
Helen?

01:11:52.264 --> 01:11:54.658
It's getting smaller!
It's caving in!

01:11:54.693 --> 01:11:56.268
Chloe! Go!

01:11:56.303 --> 01:12:00.359
Chloe, come on! Come on!
Come on, go, Chloe!

01:12:02.013 --> 01:12:05.408
Come on, go! Chloe, go!

01:12:06.539 --> 01:12:08.628
Chloe, go! Come on!

01:12:08.663 --> 01:12:12.066
Here, grab my hand!
It's caving in!

01:12:12.101 --> 01:12:13.319
Come on, come on!

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:15.853
Pull her! Pull her!

01:12:23.121 --> 01:12:25.166
He's got her!
Come on, we gotta go.

01:12:25.201 --> 01:12:26.646
Chloe, we gotta leave!

01:12:26.681 --> 01:12:27.725
- Can't leave her!
- We gotta leave!

01:12:27.726 --> 01:12:29.040
We can't help her! Come on!

01:12:29.075 --> 01:12:31.303
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

01:12:35.742 --> 01:12:37.701
Helen?

01:12:37.736 --> 01:12:40.660
Chloe, she's gone. We gotta go!
Come on, Chloe!

01:12:40.695 --> 01:12:42.793
No, she's not! Helen!

01:12:42.828 --> 01:12:45.186
Chloe, come on!
We gotta go.

01:12:45.221 --> 01:12:46.840
Come on!

01:12:46.875 --> 01:12:48.441
- I know she's in there.
- Chloe, she's...

01:12:48.442 --> 01:12:49.887
- Helen! Helen!
- I think she's...

01:12:49.922 --> 01:12:51.802
No!

01:12:58.852 --> 01:13:00.637
Helen!

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:06.251
Helen!

01:13:06.286 --> 01:13:08.558
He took her, he took her.

01:13:10.951 --> 01:13:13.040
At least she's alive, okay?
At least she's alive.

01:13:13.075 --> 01:13:15.509
- Why did he they want her?
- I don't know, I don't know.

01:13:21.353 --> 01:13:24.182
Chloe, Chloe,
calm down, calm down.

01:13:24.217 --> 01:13:25.575
Breathe, okay? Breathe.

01:13:25.610 --> 01:13:27.446
Look at me, look at me.
Breathe.

01:13:31.145 --> 01:13:34.192
Good. Good, like that.

01:13:34.227 --> 01:13:35.585
How do you feel?

01:13:39.458 --> 01:13:42.635
Please help me find her.

01:13:42.670 --> 01:13:44.245
Please?
- Okay.

01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:48.511
- Please?
- I will, okay?

01:13:48.546 --> 01:13:52.036
We will.
We'll find her.

01:13:54.212 --> 01:13:56.040
Okay.

01:13:56.075 --> 01:13:58.434
Here. Come on, come on.

01:13:58.469 --> 01:14:01.088
- Other side.
- Other side?

01:14:01.123 --> 01:14:03.308
Here, come on.

01:14:13.231 --> 01:14:14.624
Here, hold on.

01:14:18.236 --> 01:14:20.760
Take it easy.
Keep breathing.

01:14:33.251 --> 01:14:34.774
We're there!

01:14:34.809 --> 01:14:36.515
Chloe, you gotta be careful.

01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:38.604
We have to find Helen, okay?

01:14:38.639 --> 01:14:40.553
Look, making your
injuries worse won't help her!

01:14:40.554 --> 01:14:41.854
Don't lecture me!

01:14:44.131 --> 01:14:47.265
Chloe, I can't
lose you, too, okay?

01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:48.600
I can't.

01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:51.521
What do you mean?

01:14:51.522 --> 01:14:53.401
I mean, I care about you.

01:14:57.667 --> 01:15:00.539
I care about you, too.

01:15:03.455 --> 01:15:06.545
Look, we'll find Helen.

01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:09.722
Look at me.
I promise, okay?

01:15:11.724 --> 01:15:13.813
You're hurt.

01:15:13.848 --> 01:15:15.336
Let's just rest.
- I'm scared.

01:15:15.371 --> 01:15:17.338
I know, I know, I know.

01:15:19.689 --> 01:15:21.342
I'm sorry.

01:15:21.377 --> 01:15:23.736
We'll get out of this
together, okay?

01:15:23.771 --> 01:15:27.566
And we'll find Helen and
we'll all get outta here, okay?

01:15:27.601 --> 01:15:30.177
Okay.

01:15:30.212 --> 01:15:31.875
Promise.
- I promise, I promise.

01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:33.441
Okay.

01:15:33.476 --> 01:15:36.140
Here, here, here.

01:15:39.143 --> 01:15:41.014
Slow, slow!

01:15:46.237 --> 01:15:47.630
Okay.

01:15:50.807 --> 01:15:52.765
We're getting close, I think.
Careful.

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:53.800
I think she's right there.

01:15:53.801 --> 01:15:55.101
Yeah.

01:15:55.107 --> 01:15:56.595
Oh, my God.
Turn off the light!

01:15:56.630 --> 01:15:57.891
Turn off the light!
- Helen!

01:15:57.892 --> 01:15:59.250
- Oh my God.
- Oh, my gosh, how...

01:15:59.285 --> 01:16:00.893
- What are they doing?
- I don't know.

01:16:00.895 --> 01:16:02.296
- Is she alive?
- I don't know.

01:16:02.331 --> 01:16:03.288
We gotta do something.

01:16:03.289 --> 01:16:05.865
Oh, God.

01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:09.695
Okay. I have an idea.
Give me my tech.

01:16:09.730 --> 01:16:11.175
Yeah. Here, here.

01:16:11.210 --> 01:16:14.308
All right.

01:16:14.343 --> 01:16:15.953
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna reboot him.

01:16:15.954 --> 01:16:18.791
Reboot him? Why didn't
we think of that before?

01:16:18.826 --> 01:16:20.914
We were too far away for me
to access his programming.

01:16:20.915 --> 01:16:22.229
Okay.

01:16:22.264 --> 01:16:24.884
Well, you think you can do it?

01:16:24.919 --> 01:16:26.180
The firewall!

01:16:26.181 --> 01:16:28.322
Oh, God.
Can you bypass it?

01:16:28.357 --> 01:16:30.107
Yeah, I think so.

01:16:30.142 --> 01:16:32.413
Helen, Helen,
hang in there, please.

01:16:32.448 --> 01:16:34.502
Okay, I'm working on it,
I'm working on it.

01:16:34.537 --> 01:16:36.592
Okay.

01:16:36.627 --> 01:16:39.595
All right, okay, yeah, yeah.

01:16:39.630 --> 01:16:41.292
- Hurry.
- Oh, God.

01:16:41.327 --> 01:16:42.815
Okay.

01:16:42.850 --> 01:16:45.383
- Oh, shit, they found us.
- Okay.

01:16:45.418 --> 01:16:46.863
Come on, come on,
do something.

01:16:46.898 --> 01:16:47.898
Hurry, come on!
- It's not working, Luke.

01:16:47.899 --> 01:16:49.213
It's not working.

01:16:49.248 --> 01:16:51.432
Okay, I think I can find
another way in.

01:16:51.467 --> 01:16:53.251
They're coming!
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!

01:16:53.252 --> 01:16:54.914
Okay, I'm going,
I'm going, I'm going.

01:16:54.949 --> 01:16:56.733
They're getting closer, Chloe!
Do something! Hurry!

01:16:56.734 --> 01:16:58.386
- Work, damn it, work!
- Come on, hurry!

01:16:58.387 --> 01:17:00.398
Okay, okay, I can't do it.

01:17:00.433 --> 01:17:03.531
There! Got it!

01:17:03.566 --> 01:17:06.926
Protect makers.
Protect. Protect.

01:17:10.626 --> 01:17:12.279
Chloe, good job!

01:17:12.314 --> 01:17:14.412
Good job!
Helen, get over here!

01:17:14.447 --> 01:17:17.154
Get over here! Hurry.

01:17:17.189 --> 01:17:20.766
You're alive!
You're alive!

01:17:20.801 --> 01:17:25.684
I felt myself going, but I
think you interrupted it.

01:17:25.719 --> 01:17:29.383
I'm so sorry for everything
I ever said bad about you.

01:17:29.418 --> 01:17:31.603
Yeah, apparently.

01:17:31.638 --> 01:17:33.203
Gosh, Helen, what did
they do to you?

01:17:33.205 --> 01:17:34.954
- Are you an alien?
- I hope not.

01:17:34.989 --> 01:17:37.957
Oh, my.

01:17:37.992 --> 01:17:41.874
God, we gotta
get outta here, guys.

01:17:41.909 --> 01:17:45.225
Shit, look!
He's fighting back!

01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:46.560
- Protect!
- Hey!

01:17:57.542 --> 01:17:59.239
Must...

01:17:59.274 --> 01:18:00.405
pro...

01:18:00.406 --> 01:18:01.536
...tect.

01:18:01.537 --> 01:18:05.028
Protect-tect-tect.

01:18:05.063 --> 01:18:07.595
- Chloe!
- Roll it!

01:18:07.630 --> 01:18:10.207
Roll what? For what?

01:18:10.242 --> 01:18:13.123
If he dies, we die.

01:18:13.158 --> 01:18:15.212
We have to let the world
know invasion is here.

01:18:18.128 --> 01:18:19.999
I'm Helen Martin.

01:18:20.034 --> 01:18:24.003
I'm here with my friends,
Chloe Coyle and Luke Sullivan.

01:18:24.038 --> 01:18:26.353
What started off as
a science experiment

01:18:26.388 --> 01:18:30.880
in the mountains turned out
to be a nightmare.

01:18:30.915 --> 01:18:34.448
Behind me is what I can only
describe as invaders

01:18:34.483 --> 01:18:38.278
in a large craft

01:18:38.313 --> 01:18:42.195
with the sole intention
to abduct and exterminate us.

01:18:46.852 --> 01:18:48.152
Oh!

01:19:06.567 --> 01:19:08.178
Guys, it's falling!

01:19:08.213 --> 01:19:09.527
Go, go, go, take cover!

01:19:09.562 --> 01:19:11.659
Come on, come on!
Move, move, move!

01:19:11.694 --> 01:19:13.836
Go, go, go!

01:19:13.871 --> 01:19:15.523
But you must have known
that your robot

01:19:15.524 --> 01:19:19.276
couldn't be controlled by
a simple line of code.

01:19:19.311 --> 01:19:21.887
It was more than just
a simple line of code.

01:19:21.922 --> 01:19:24.281
We couldn't have been
prepared for what happened!

01:19:24.316 --> 01:19:26.022
Well, you could have been
more prepared

01:19:26.057 --> 01:19:28.143
if you'd been more
forthcoming with your friends.

01:19:28.146 --> 01:19:30.069
Why does he keep saying that?

01:19:30.104 --> 01:19:31.404
Luke...

01:19:32.158 --> 01:19:34.160
What?

01:19:34.195 --> 01:19:38.904
Come on, Miss Martin.
Tell him.

01:19:38.939 --> 01:19:43.735
Some of Hornet's parts,

01:19:43.770 --> 01:19:49.393
some of his parts, the professor
didn't build on his own.

01:19:50.524 --> 01:19:54.180
He said he acquired them.

01:19:54.215 --> 01:19:56.966
Acquired them?
From where?

01:19:57.001 --> 01:20:00.099
I don't know exactly,
but the technology

01:20:00.134 --> 01:20:02.754
was so far more advanced
than anything

01:20:02.789 --> 01:20:05.496
that I had ever seen before,
that the power source,

01:20:05.531 --> 01:20:10.022
the weapons, we realized that
it had an old configuration.

01:20:10.057 --> 01:20:11.676
It was a robot,

01:20:11.711 --> 01:20:15.985
but some of the parts
were missing, and we...

01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:19.902
Yeah, and you just kept
that from me this whole time.

01:20:19.937 --> 01:20:21.817
Sorry.

01:20:21.852 --> 01:20:24.254
I... the professor told me
that we couldn't say anything.

01:20:24.289 --> 01:20:27.170
And the technology was so
advanced, I couldn't.

01:20:27.205 --> 01:20:30.173
That's bullshit, Helen!

01:20:30.208 --> 01:20:35.482
This whole time we were
attacked, you didn't tell me?

01:20:35.517 --> 01:20:37.180
So the attack on us,

01:20:37.215 --> 01:20:38.737
it had everything to do
with Hornet and you knew it!

01:20:38.738 --> 01:20:40.226
You knew it!

01:20:40.261 --> 01:20:42.925
I couldn't know that
for sure, Luke!

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:46.058
That's cold.
That's really cold.

01:20:46.093 --> 01:20:48.756
Luke, help us find Hornet.

01:20:51.672 --> 01:20:54.675
Screw you!
I'm not telling you anything!

01:20:54.710 --> 01:20:57.069
Look, if Hornet
remains activated,

01:20:57.104 --> 01:20:58.462
who knows what could happen?

01:20:58.497 --> 01:21:01.247
We have to find him and
shut him down!

01:21:01.282 --> 01:21:05.295
Now he was able to track you
somehow in the mountains.

01:21:05.330 --> 01:21:07.819
Is there any way for you
to track him?

01:21:07.854 --> 01:21:08.854
- Luke...
- What?

01:21:08.855 --> 01:21:10.155
Don't.

01:21:10.161 --> 01:21:11.475
Give me a good reason why not.

01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:12.868
Because we can't
trust this guy!

01:21:12.903 --> 01:21:14.391
And I can trust you?

01:21:14.426 --> 01:21:16.610
After everything
that we've seen?

01:21:16.645 --> 01:21:19.613
How do we know that
he's the government?

01:21:19.648 --> 01:21:23.530
Luke, we have been
friends for six months!

01:21:23.565 --> 01:21:27.752
Does that not count
for anything?

01:21:27.787 --> 01:21:29.275
Not if Chloe's gone.

01:21:30.537 --> 01:21:32.757
I believe that she's okay,

01:21:32.792 --> 01:21:36.282
but if we're gonna find her,
we have to stick together.

01:21:36.317 --> 01:21:37.849
That may work for a while,

01:21:37.884 --> 01:21:39.884
but eventually you'll
turn on each other.

01:21:39.885 --> 01:21:42.854
You don't know us.

01:21:42.889 --> 01:21:46.249
Humans are weak.

01:21:46.284 --> 01:21:48.120
I know you more than you think.

01:21:51.515 --> 01:21:54.126
Sounds like you weren't hugged
that much as a child.

01:22:01.438 --> 01:22:04.876
Helen's right.

01:22:04.911 --> 01:22:08.053
You can do whatever
you want to me.

01:22:08.088 --> 01:22:11.448
It's not gonna tear me apart.
It's not gonna tear us apart.

01:22:11.483 --> 01:22:15.452
Game over.

01:22:17.410 --> 01:22:19.978
Pity.

01:22:20.013 --> 01:22:21.980
Have it your way.

01:22:27.072 --> 01:22:29.248
Stay there!

01:22:29.283 --> 01:22:30.583
Hornet?

01:22:35.211 --> 01:22:36.734
Knock, knock,
Helen Martin.

01:22:36.769 --> 01:22:38.170
Hornet?

01:22:38.205 --> 01:22:40.738
Hornet has come
to save friends.

01:22:40.773 --> 01:22:41.816
Where's Chloe?

01:22:41.817 --> 01:22:42.917
Hornet returned Chloe

01:22:42.918 --> 01:22:44.123
to hospital.

01:22:44.124 --> 01:22:47.353
- She is resting.
- How can we trust you?

01:22:47.388 --> 01:22:49.529
Hornet, what is your
primary directive?

01:22:49.564 --> 01:22:52.968
Saving you assholes.
