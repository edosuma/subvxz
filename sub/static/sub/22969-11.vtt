00:02.203 --> 00:04.838
- Baird: Who is that?
- Nicole...my Guardian.

00:04.838 --> 00:07.075
- You let me believe
that she was dead.
- Jenkins: You cannot trust her!

00:07.075 --> 00:09.243
- Actually, I do.
- Nicole: Jenkins,
search your heart.

00:09.243 --> 00:10.611
I was too blind to see,

00:10.611 --> 00:12.246
all along she was just trying
to save us.

00:12.246 --> 00:13.781
Flynn: He's giving her
his immortality.

00:13.781 --> 00:15.483
Thank you.

00:15.483 --> 00:17.518
It's time I found out who I can
be apart from this place.

00:17.518 --> 00:21.755
There can only be one Librarian.
History shows war shall come
between them. War!

00:21.755 --> 00:24.458
You put this right
before it's too late.

00:24.458 --> 00:28.396
Jenkins:
Mr. Carson has resigned
from the Library.

00:28.396 --> 00:31.832
He will not be coming back.

00:31.832 --> 00:33.134
( music playing )

00:33.134 --> 00:36.970
Eye of newt, wing of bat,
leg of toad,

00:36.970 --> 00:39.540
tofu alternatives.

00:43.144 --> 00:45.446
- ( cathedral bells clanging )
- Ow! Ah!

00:45.446 --> 00:46.447
Ah!

00:47.448 --> 00:48.449
Ah!

00:49.517 --> 00:50.984
It's an
interesting strategy.

00:50.984 --> 00:54.522
However, I probably would
go with the bishop.

00:54.522 --> 00:57.258
But you've always
favored the knight.

00:57.258 --> 01:00.661
( chittering )

01:00.661 --> 01:03.564
- ( grunts )
- ( cathedral bells clanging )

01:15.143 --> 01:17.611
Oh, I do love
a challenge.

01:17.611 --> 01:20.414
- ( cathedral bells clanging )
- ( grunting )

01:22.216 --> 01:23.551
Well, Flynn quit, so, yeah,

01:23.551 --> 01:24.952
I guess you could say
we've broken up.

01:24.952 --> 01:26.354
It's complicated.

01:26.354 --> 01:29.290
No, Mom, it wasn't because
of another woman.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.125
Well, it wasn't wasn't

01:31.125 --> 01:32.226
because of another woman.

01:32.226 --> 01:33.894
( cathedral bells clanging )

01:33.894 --> 01:35.095
Mom, I'll call you back!

01:36.197 --> 01:39.133
( cathedral bells clanging )

01:39.133 --> 01:41.335
What is that ringing?
It hurts!

01:41.335 --> 01:44.272
Where's it coming from?

01:44.272 --> 01:45.806
Jones,
what did you do?

01:45.806 --> 01:48.242
Nothing! It's like the
Library's screaming at us!

01:49.109 --> 01:50.378
( rumbling )

01:50.378 --> 01:53.147
The Library,
it's collapsing!

01:55.283 --> 01:57.885
( theme music playing )

02:05.293 --> 02:07.695
Please, everyone!
Come, come!

02:07.695 --> 02:09.730
Grab a wire,
each of you.

02:09.730 --> 02:13.401
Hold. Hold it,
don't let go. Hold it!

02:15.469 --> 02:16.870
( rumbling stops )

02:16.870 --> 02:18.606
( sighs )
Good.

02:18.606 --> 02:20.308
Temporary tethering.
That should buy us

02:20.308 --> 02:22.343
a few hours' grace
at the most.

02:22.343 --> 02:23.744
Jenkins,
what just happened?

02:23.744 --> 02:25.413
Exactly what I said
would happen, Colonel,

02:25.413 --> 02:27.481
if the Tethering Ceremony
did not take place.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.683
The Library is uncoupling
from reality.

02:29.683 --> 02:31.118
Can we let go of
the wires now?

02:31.118 --> 02:33.153
Yes, yes,
the deed is done.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.555
Well, what deed,
exactly?

02:34.555 --> 02:36.390
The only thing
bonding the Library

02:36.390 --> 02:38.058
to the world at this point

02:38.058 --> 02:39.126
are the four of you.

02:39.126 --> 02:40.228
So I fashioned,

02:40.228 --> 02:41.529
for want of
a better word,

02:41.529 --> 02:43.297
could be called
an anchor.

02:43.297 --> 02:44.598
This is the first book ever
in the Library.

02:44.598 --> 02:46.066
It was the first
on the shelf

02:46.066 --> 02:49.036
at the Library of Alexandria,
Third Century BC.

02:49.036 --> 02:52.340
It has seniority over all
books and artifacts here.

02:52.340 --> 02:55.509
By connecting them to it
through you,

02:55.509 --> 02:58.846
we created a bond with
the Library and reality,

02:58.846 --> 03:00.281
but only temporarily.

03:00.281 --> 03:02.216
Colonel, we have to perform
the Tethering Ceremony today.

03:02.216 --> 03:04.151
Okay, but tether
with who?

03:04.151 --> 03:06.720
You have three excellent
candidates in front of you,
please pick one.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.522
Well, I don't know if
I want to be immortal!

03:08.522 --> 03:10.458
You can't just rush that
kind of eternal decision.

03:10.458 --> 03:12.360
Magic? I've already got stuck
with a magic tattoo,

03:12.360 --> 03:14.762
I don't know if I want to spend
infinity powered by the stuff.

03:14.762 --> 03:16.664
I have no problem
with the magic at all,

03:16.664 --> 03:18.366
but immortality is
a really long time.

03:18.366 --> 03:20.167
Why don't you just tether to
the Library, Jenkins?

03:20.167 --> 03:22.370
I cannot!
I am not a Librarian.

03:22.370 --> 03:24.505
Now-- please!
Oh, sorry.

03:24.505 --> 03:27.408
Um, best not to
touch that, Cassandra.

03:27.408 --> 03:29.677
The reason why it has
survived as long as it has,

03:29.677 --> 03:32.580
it is replete with
crazy, wild magic.

03:32.580 --> 03:34.948
It is best left
rolled as it is.

03:34.948 --> 03:36.417
And the bells were?

03:36.417 --> 03:37.451
- ( sets book on table )
- The bells.

03:37.451 --> 03:38.452
Follow me, please.

03:38.452 --> 03:41.655
( music playing )

03:52.333 --> 03:55.403
This is what
you heard chiming.

03:55.403 --> 03:57.705
The Bells of Notre Dame
came from that?

03:57.705 --> 03:59.373
Mm.

03:59.373 --> 04:01.475
The Horologe
of the Equinox.

04:01.475 --> 04:03.210
It measures
the movement of key

04:03.210 --> 04:04.745
celestial bodies.

04:06.246 --> 04:09.450
And it has one hell
of a security system.

04:09.450 --> 04:11.752
( whooshing )

04:11.752 --> 04:15.356
Ashkar, Ganymede,
Medusa's Tears,

04:15.356 --> 04:17.725
uh, many
unnamed planets

04:17.725 --> 04:20.528
one dwarf star whose name
should never be translated

04:20.528 --> 04:21.895
in polite company,

04:21.895 --> 04:26.099
all combining to make
the Equinox of Binding.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.335
The Equinox has begun.

04:27.335 --> 04:29.670
We have a window
of 24 hours,

04:29.670 --> 04:32.906
after which our chance
for tethering will be over,

04:32.906 --> 04:36.076
and the Library will revert
to what it was originally.

04:36.076 --> 04:37.411
Which is?

04:37.411 --> 04:40.314
An institution
caring only

04:40.314 --> 04:41.882
for the protection
of its artifacts.

04:41.882 --> 04:45.218
Without a link to humanity,
without a greater cause,

04:45.218 --> 04:48.456
the Library will care
only for itself.

04:48.456 --> 04:50.958
Please let this
focus your minds.

04:50.958 --> 04:55.228
The next time
the Horologe chimes,

04:55.228 --> 04:56.764
it will be game over.

05:00.267 --> 05:02.302
This is a matter
for the Librarians

05:02.302 --> 05:04.805
and their Guardian.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.607
I will retire

05:06.607 --> 05:08.409
and await
your decision.

05:14.047 --> 05:15.048
Jenkins is right.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.283
We've left it too long.

05:16.283 --> 05:17.785
One of you has to
tether with me.

05:17.785 --> 05:19.252
Draw straws
or something.

05:19.252 --> 05:22.122
There's got to be a more
rational way to figure this out.

05:22.122 --> 05:24.692
I hate to say it, but Flynn
would know what to do.

05:24.692 --> 05:27.294
No, Flynn would know how
to run away from this.

05:27.294 --> 05:29.963
We're not leaving
till we're done.

05:29.963 --> 05:32.032
Guys?

05:32.032 --> 05:33.701
I know Jenkins
said not to, but--

05:33.701 --> 05:35.536
You just unrolled
the scroll?

05:35.536 --> 05:37.371
"Don't unroll the scroll"
is what he said!

05:37.371 --> 05:38.672
- Don't!
- I know, I know,

05:38.672 --> 05:40.140
but it was just
so tempting,

05:40.140 --> 05:41.542
and old, and scroll-y,

05:41.542 --> 05:44.478
and I just took one little
look and... look.

05:44.478 --> 05:46.179
It says,
"The Selection of One."

05:46.179 --> 05:47.214
The selection
of one what?

05:47.214 --> 05:48.315
One Librarian.

05:48.315 --> 05:49.550
It's instructions?

05:49.550 --> 05:50.951
No, it's a spell.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.853
And I know, I know, I know
that magic is bad,

05:52.853 --> 05:54.922
but, I mean,
what are the chances?

05:54.922 --> 05:57.290
It's like the Library
wanted us to see this.

05:57.290 --> 06:00.193
A spell which tells us which
one of us is the best of us?

06:00.193 --> 06:02.663
- Exactly.
- It's the best plan
I've heard so far.

06:02.663 --> 06:04.064
This is better than
drawing straws.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.366
As much as I hate magic,
I hate luck even more.

06:07.300 --> 06:09.169
Well, if we're
all agreed,

06:09.169 --> 06:10.170
let's do it.

06:10.170 --> 06:11.639
Okay, it says, um...

06:11.639 --> 06:12.840
we need to link hands.

06:12.840 --> 06:15.075
Stone, will you--
can you read the rest?

06:15.075 --> 06:16.410
I...

06:18.446 --> 06:20.714
( Stone speaking
in Ancient Greek )

06:29.557 --> 06:30.924
Did we do it right?

06:30.924 --> 06:33.293
My Ancient Greek is
a little rusty, okay?

06:33.293 --> 06:35.629
It's hard to hold a conversation
in a dead language.

06:35.629 --> 06:37.030
I'll go check out
some pronouns.

06:37.030 --> 06:39.199
Everyone take a break,
meet back in here in an hour.

06:39.199 --> 06:40.668
Cassandra:
Okay.

06:55.048 --> 06:56.650
( scoffs )
What have I told them

06:56.650 --> 06:59.520
about bringing things
down here?

06:59.520 --> 07:02.656
Not checking with me so
that I can catalogue it?

07:02.656 --> 07:03.991
What is this?

07:06.226 --> 07:08.195
The magic mirror?

07:08.195 --> 07:09.730
What is it doing down--

07:12.199 --> 07:13.467
Okay, Dr. Freud,

07:13.467 --> 07:16.269
tell me what
I should be thinking.

07:16.269 --> 07:19.507
( pulsing hum )

07:34.822 --> 07:37.625
I know how
you feel, buddy.

07:38.659 --> 07:41.461
( pulsing hum )

07:49.169 --> 07:51.171
Jenkins,
are you in here?

07:52.540 --> 07:54.474
( pulsing hum )

08:02.449 --> 08:04.885
Little bit of crime
calms the mind,

08:04.885 --> 08:07.621
gives a thief...
perspective.

08:07.621 --> 08:10.223
( pulsing hum )

08:14.127 --> 08:16.730
Very... tempting

08:16.730 --> 08:19.266
pressing a...
big red button.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.679
Whoa.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.181
Where are we?

08:35.448 --> 08:37.150
These are
The Testing Grounds.

08:37.150 --> 08:40.320
Welcome to
The Trial of the One.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.922
"The Trial of the One"?

08:41.922 --> 08:43.156
I thought it was
The Selection of One?

08:43.156 --> 08:45.726
Lazy translation.
Now please be quiet.

08:45.726 --> 08:48.461
No, that's a holdover
from Jenkins.

08:48.461 --> 08:49.663
Be quiet!

08:51.665 --> 08:53.066
"Holdover"?
What do you mean?

08:53.066 --> 08:55.368
I have taken control
of Jenkins's body

08:55.368 --> 08:57.771
so I may speak to you.

08:57.771 --> 08:59.139
I am the Library.

08:59.139 --> 09:00.974
Jenkins-- Library,

09:00.974 --> 09:03.811
please just tell us
our Jenkins is safe.

09:03.811 --> 09:06.479
Jenkins warned you not
to touch the scroll.

09:06.479 --> 09:07.881
You ignored him.

09:07.881 --> 09:11.384
And now you must compete
in The Trial of the One.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.385
Which is?

09:12.385 --> 09:13.654
Fight to the death

09:13.654 --> 09:14.955
between Librarians.

09:14.955 --> 09:16.423
- No way! Absolutely not!
- What! No?

09:16.423 --> 09:18.458
You think that we're gonna
try to kill each other

09:18.458 --> 09:19.559
just 'cause you say jump?

09:19.559 --> 09:22.129
No, I don't.

09:22.129 --> 09:24.965
I think you will kill each
other because, if you don't,

09:24.965 --> 09:26.066
I...

09:27.467 --> 09:28.468
will kill Jenkins.

09:28.468 --> 09:31.138
The Kiss of Mahakali,

09:31.138 --> 09:35.709
poised directly over
Jenkins's mortal heart.

09:35.709 --> 09:38.245
If you disobey
my instructions...

09:40.781 --> 09:43.651
I will kill Jenkins.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.019
No, no,

09:46.019 --> 09:47.888
the Library would
never do this.

09:47.888 --> 09:50.190
You can't be
the Library.

09:50.190 --> 09:50.991
I don't believe it.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.525
Jenkins is
your Custodian.

09:52.525 --> 09:53.727
Why would you
want to hurt him?

09:53.727 --> 09:55.896
Has being untethered
changed you so much?

09:55.896 --> 09:59.432
I was born in
the Third Century BC.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.636
I was built to protect
my artifacts above all else.

10:02.636 --> 10:04.805
What about
your Librarians?

10:05.839 --> 10:08.175
They are not artifacts.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.050
Put these on.

10:18.585 --> 10:19.787
Why? What is it?

10:20.620 --> 10:22.089
Okay.

10:22.089 --> 10:23.390
Dang it.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.033
No. No, please, stop.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.367
I'll choose one of
them to Tether with,

10:34.367 --> 10:35.502
right now!

10:35.502 --> 10:37.070
What has begun,
has begun.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.271
It cannot
be stopped.

10:38.271 --> 10:39.539
Cassandra Cillian,

10:39.539 --> 10:42.109
Jacob Stone,
Ezekiel Jones,

10:42.109 --> 10:45.278
you now each wear
a Ring of Nightmares.

10:45.278 --> 10:48.081
It will transport
you to the heart

10:48.081 --> 10:49.416
of your
deepest fear.

10:49.416 --> 10:50.951
Confront that fear

10:50.951 --> 10:52.552
and you'll be
strong warriors

10:52.552 --> 10:55.956
fit to compete in
The Testing Grounds.

10:55.956 --> 10:58.025
Oh, and you're right.

10:58.025 --> 11:00.427
Librarians will not
fight their friends.

11:01.829 --> 11:03.230
Your fears will
change all that.

11:03.230 --> 11:04.732
( pulsing hum )

11:04.732 --> 11:06.867
Now press the buttons,

11:06.867 --> 11:08.568
go into your
nightmares,

11:08.568 --> 11:10.570
fight to the death.

11:10.570 --> 11:12.072
No. No, don't do it!

11:12.072 --> 11:15.976
I don't care what happens
when I push this button,

11:15.976 --> 11:18.078
I will never hurt you.

11:18.078 --> 11:20.480
Nothing will ever
change that.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.482
Nothing.

11:22.482 --> 11:24.752
Librarians together.

11:24.752 --> 11:26.987
Librarians forever.

11:34.728 --> 11:37.931
( indistinct chatter )

11:44.537 --> 11:46.039
Wait, why do I
know this?

11:49.743 --> 11:51.845
Prison officer:
Eyes down, princess.

11:51.845 --> 11:54.714
Break rocks or
I'll break you.

12:16.837 --> 12:19.606
( skin crackling )

12:19.606 --> 12:21.975
( eerie humming )

12:21.975 --> 12:24.778
( groaning )

12:31.885 --> 12:35.022
( music playing )

12:38.558 --> 12:40.393
( music playing )

12:40.393 --> 12:43.396
( indistinct chatter )

12:46.934 --> 12:48.301
It's the school trip.

12:48.301 --> 12:49.502
Teenagers:
* She's the suckiest *

12:49.502 --> 12:51.038
* She's the yuckiest *

12:51.038 --> 12:53.473
- * She's the worst girl
times a million *
- No.

12:53.473 --> 12:55.075
- No, not this.
- * She's so icky *

12:55.075 --> 12:57.744
* And she gives hickeys
and we all hate *

12:57.744 --> 12:59.312
* Cassandra Cillian *

12:59.312 --> 13:00.513
( sighs )

13:00.513 --> 13:03.750
( music playing )

13:03.750 --> 13:04.885
- There she is!
- All: Get her!

13:04.885 --> 13:06.453
No. No!

13:06.453 --> 13:09.990
- No!
- ( teenagers clamoring )

13:14.194 --> 13:16.997
( breathing heavily )

13:23.070 --> 13:25.405
Witch:
Come in...

13:25.405 --> 13:28.141
Jacob Stone.

13:30.343 --> 13:32.412
We're gonna
die here. man.

13:32.412 --> 13:34.081
We're all gonna
die here.

13:34.081 --> 13:36.950
( chuckles )
No, we're not.

13:36.950 --> 13:38.852
You know how
I know that?

13:39.853 --> 13:42.289
Because you're
not real.

13:42.289 --> 13:44.858
Hate to break it to you,
mate, but none of this is.

13:44.858 --> 13:47.460
You know how
I know you're not real?

13:48.661 --> 13:52.165
Because if this was real,
that means I got caught,

13:52.165 --> 13:54.968
and I never
get caught.

13:55.768 --> 13:57.070
( grunts )

13:57.070 --> 13:59.973
Prison officer:
Bring 'em out.

13:59.973 --> 14:01.841
( van doors opening )

14:02.876 --> 14:03.877
Oh, God.

14:03.877 --> 14:05.178
It's him.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.746
Oh, God.

14:06.746 --> 14:09.449
( music playing )

14:13.887 --> 14:16.990
( growling )

14:18.926 --> 14:22.095
- ( panting )
- Girl: Go! Get her!

14:25.165 --> 14:27.367
Baird:
Jenkins.

14:29.436 --> 14:31.671
Jenkins, I know
you're in there.

14:31.671 --> 14:33.974
Please fight back.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.442
Our friends need you.

14:35.442 --> 14:39.179
You're issuing
orders to me?

14:39.179 --> 14:40.847
The Guardian who failed
in her sole duty

14:40.847 --> 14:42.950
of protecting
her Librarians?

14:42.950 --> 14:45.518
I didn't fail,
Flynn quit.

14:45.518 --> 14:48.188
That was your
greatest failure.

14:48.188 --> 14:52.259
No. No, no, I cannot,
I will not accept that

14:52.259 --> 14:54.194
this is how our Library
would behave!

14:54.194 --> 14:56.296
Accept,
do not accept.

14:56.296 --> 14:57.764
I'm not seeking
your permission.

14:57.764 --> 14:58.966
( sighs )

14:58.966 --> 15:00.767
This is all
our fault.

15:00.767 --> 15:02.235
We should have
tethered sooner.

15:02.235 --> 15:05.738
I am as I've
always been.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.340
We can still help you.

15:07.340 --> 15:10.143
Please, please
let us help you!

15:10.143 --> 15:12.545
I am doing my duty.

15:12.545 --> 15:14.114
Your duty

15:14.114 --> 15:16.516
is to bear witness
to these Librarians.

15:16.516 --> 15:20.520
You can watch,
but you cannot intervene.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.389
So rise.

15:22.389 --> 15:24.357
And watch.

15:31.131 --> 15:32.799
( panting )

15:32.799 --> 15:34.601
( clamoring )

15:42.742 --> 15:43.943
This looks like...

15:43.943 --> 15:46.246
what was the
name of that place?

15:46.246 --> 15:49.349
- Boy: We're gonna find you!
- Girl: Cassandra!

15:49.349 --> 15:51.118
( music playing )

15:51.118 --> 15:53.386
( panting )

15:53.386 --> 15:55.022
No, no, no,
it's not real!

15:55.022 --> 15:57.624
- It's not real.
- Girl: She's trying
to get away.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.394
Where's she hiding?
Come on, let's go!

16:01.394 --> 16:03.163
- Go!
- Spread out!

16:03.163 --> 16:04.964
( indistinct chatter )

16:04.964 --> 16:08.535
- Man: Cassie!
- Eddie, anything?

16:08.535 --> 16:10.637
Girl: Cassandra!

16:10.637 --> 16:15.042
- ( gasps )
- Boy: Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

16:15.042 --> 16:17.044
- Cassie!
- ( whimpering )

16:17.044 --> 16:18.445
It's not real.

16:22.282 --> 16:24.117
( wheezing breathing )

16:28.388 --> 16:29.756
Show me.

16:29.756 --> 16:31.558
Show you what?

16:31.558 --> 16:34.327
Your curse.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.763
Show me.

16:36.763 --> 16:38.931
Such power.

16:38.931 --> 16:41.334
To remove it,

16:41.334 --> 16:44.671
you will pay a price.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.506
What price?

16:46.506 --> 16:49.576
It will hurt.

16:49.576 --> 16:51.178
( chuckles )

16:54.781 --> 16:57.984
( groaning )
Hey! Hey!

16:57.984 --> 16:59.319
Don't!

16:59.319 --> 17:01.321
You never look him
in the eye.

17:01.321 --> 17:02.422
Do you understand me?

17:02.422 --> 17:07.894
Yeah, sure,
whatever.

17:07.894 --> 17:10.797
( grunting )

17:18.037 --> 17:19.506
Oh! Uh... yeah,

17:19.506 --> 17:21.241
I know I'm not supposed
to look you in the eye,

17:21.241 --> 17:22.742
but in my defense,
you looked at me first!

17:22.742 --> 17:24.277
Oh, hell!

17:24.277 --> 17:26.546
No.
No, I am their Guardian!

17:26.546 --> 17:28.515
For God's sake,
let me help them!

17:31.551 --> 17:34.421
- ( Cassandra crying )
- Boy: Where are you, Cassandra?

17:35.588 --> 17:37.957
- Cassandra?
- Girl: Come out, come out!

17:37.957 --> 17:39.459
Cass?

17:39.459 --> 17:43.163
You lost the right to Guard
them a long time ago.

17:43.163 --> 17:45.265
Now can only witness
their suffering.

17:45.265 --> 17:46.766
They can neither see you
nor hear you.

17:46.766 --> 17:47.834
Cass...

17:51.104 --> 17:52.105
It's not fair.

17:52.105 --> 17:54.174
It is fair.

17:54.174 --> 17:55.275
It is just not kind.

17:55.275 --> 17:57.510
The Library
is always kind.

17:57.510 --> 18:00.413
I do not believe
you're the Library.

18:00.413 --> 18:03.416
- ( Cassandra whimpering )
- Girl: Cassie!

18:03.416 --> 18:04.617
What if she takes her
Nightmare Ring off?

18:04.617 --> 18:07.454
Oh, then her nightmare
would end.

18:07.454 --> 18:09.322
- But she will not take it off.
- ( huffs )

18:09.322 --> 18:12.759
Cass isn't stupid,
she'll see it.

18:12.759 --> 18:13.760
Cassandra Cillian?

18:15.128 --> 18:16.296
Who is it?

18:16.296 --> 18:18.465
Oh, dear,
you know who it is.

18:18.465 --> 18:21.234
It's me, Miss Pope, your teacher
who didn't protect you

18:21.234 --> 18:23.170
the day
the bullies came.

18:23.170 --> 18:25.104
Miss Pope,
the other kids, they're--

18:25.104 --> 18:27.440
Yes, I know,
but not right now, dear.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.741
Oh, what is that
on your hand?

18:28.741 --> 18:29.742
What are you wearing?

18:31.878 --> 18:32.879
Nothing.

18:32.879 --> 18:34.747
I'm not wearing anything.

18:34.747 --> 18:36.849
Those stuck in their
nightmares cannot see
their Nightmare Rings,

18:36.849 --> 18:39.952
nor even remember
putting them on.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.954
And also, she's over here!

18:41.954 --> 18:43.623
- ( Cassandra gasps )
- Baird: Why would you do that?

18:43.623 --> 18:45.358
Why would I not?

18:49.128 --> 18:50.763
- Boy: There she is!
- Girl: Get her!

18:50.763 --> 18:52.899
( teenagers clamoring )

18:52.899 --> 18:54.734
Baird:
Okay, I get it! I get it.

18:54.734 --> 18:57.204
They're trapped in nightmares
they don't know are nightmares,

18:57.204 --> 19:00.207
but... they won't
kill each other,

19:00.207 --> 19:01.208
they're too loyal.

19:01.208 --> 19:03.176
An admirable quality,

19:03.176 --> 19:06.446
but they must be loyal
to the Library above all else.

19:08.381 --> 19:10.217
You won't turn them
against each other.

19:10.217 --> 19:11.218
Their nightmares

19:11.218 --> 19:12.752
will alter their memories.

19:12.752 --> 19:16.323
Their friends will not
be remembered as such.

19:17.224 --> 19:19.659
( panting )

19:21.928 --> 19:23.896
Jake. Ezekiel.

19:25.565 --> 19:29.101
- C-Cassandra?
- ( wheezes )

19:29.101 --> 19:30.303
Jones!

19:31.571 --> 19:33.540
Stone?
( grunts )

19:33.540 --> 19:36.943
Prisoner Jones,
causing trouble again?

19:36.943 --> 19:38.044
Cassandra?

19:38.044 --> 19:40.280
Wacky Cassie
tried to run.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.815
Wacky Cassie,
you're no fun.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.284
What? No! Ah!

19:44.284 --> 19:45.985
( groans )

19:45.985 --> 19:47.887
What did you do?

19:47.887 --> 19:49.822
Cut, cut.

19:49.822 --> 19:51.023
Snip,

19:51.023 --> 19:55.194
snip, ouch, ouch.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.865
It's time you get
the punishment you deserve.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.300
No.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.001
No, I can't
watch this.

20:02.001 --> 20:03.236
You must watch.

20:03.236 --> 20:05.171
Or what,
you'll kill Jenkins?

20:05.171 --> 20:07.039
How do I know
you are Jenkins?

20:07.039 --> 20:08.475
How do I know
you're the Library?

20:08.475 --> 20:10.677
You could be a clone
or an illusion

20:10.677 --> 20:12.379
or...

20:13.813 --> 20:15.815
You can't escape.

20:18.318 --> 20:19.852
I'm not trying to.

20:19.852 --> 20:21.621
( music playing )

20:21.621 --> 20:23.656
No! Ezekiel,
Jacob, please!

20:23.656 --> 20:26.125
Don't use our names
like you know us.

20:26.125 --> 20:27.594
But I do know you,
we're friends!

20:27.594 --> 20:30.763
We're friends?
I would rather kiss a slug.

20:30.763 --> 20:31.898
Oh, a slug!

20:31.898 --> 20:32.999
Good one, Jake.

20:32.999 --> 20:35.402
Oh, look at what
we have here.

20:35.402 --> 20:37.203
( gasps )

20:37.203 --> 20:40.139
Wacky Cassie's
found a friend.

20:40.139 --> 20:41.341
Eat it.

20:42.475 --> 20:45.745
- Both: Eat it, eat it, eat it!
- No!

20:45.745 --> 20:48.781
- ( all chanting ) Eat it!
- No!

20:48.781 --> 20:52.585
Skin, skin.
Snip, snip.

20:52.585 --> 20:57.089
( wheeze )
Ouch... ouch.

20:57.089 --> 21:00.293
( music playing )

21:03.095 --> 21:05.565
( coughing )

21:05.565 --> 21:07.600
( both grunting )

21:08.868 --> 21:10.937
Break his fingers so
he can never steal again.

21:18.978 --> 21:19.879
The Eye of Ampyx,

21:19.879 --> 21:21.714
the Seer of
Titaresia. Oh.

21:21.714 --> 21:24.884
Seems you learned something
from your Librarian after all,

21:24.884 --> 21:27.219
when you bothered
to listen, that is.

21:27.219 --> 21:29.322
Okay.
( chuckles )

21:29.322 --> 21:32.659
Flynn told me the Eye of Ampyx
always reveals the truth.

21:35.328 --> 21:37.430
Now show me the truth.

21:38.965 --> 21:40.299
Help me!

21:40.299 --> 21:41.734
Baird:
You really are trapped.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.572
Eat it, Wacky Cassie,
eat it!

21:45.572 --> 21:47.574
No! You're just
bad memories!

21:47.574 --> 21:50.477
Then forget about us,
we'll go away.

21:50.477 --> 21:52.812
All you got to do
is push the button.

21:53.813 --> 21:56.182
Wait, wait,
we're friends.

21:56.182 --> 21:58.618
We're not friends.

21:58.618 --> 22:00.653
We are friends, okay?

22:00.653 --> 22:02.689
At least,
we were friends.

22:02.689 --> 22:05.958
What's... my... name?

22:05.958 --> 22:09.195
Your name...

22:09.195 --> 22:10.530
is...

22:10.530 --> 22:11.731
I can't remember.

22:11.731 --> 22:15.402
It's so much easier
to forget.

22:15.402 --> 22:19.105
Push the button!

22:19.105 --> 22:21.273
You'll never steal again
unless you fight back.

22:21.273 --> 22:22.909
I'm not gonna fight
my friends!

22:22.909 --> 22:24.977
Well, then forget we're
your friends and fight back.

22:24.977 --> 22:25.912
Push the button!

22:25.912 --> 22:27.714
Baird:
The nightmares...

22:29.582 --> 22:32.619
...you made them forget that
they were ever friends.

22:32.619 --> 22:34.687
And so, they shall
kill each other

22:34.687 --> 22:36.322
as strangers.

22:36.322 --> 22:38.024
Stone, Ezekiel, and Teenagers:
Push the button and forget!

22:38.024 --> 22:40.560
Cassandra and Ezekiel:
Push the button and forget!

22:40.560 --> 22:42.094
Cassandra and Stone:
Push the button and forget!

22:42.094 --> 22:44.797
- Push the button!
- Push the button!

22:44.797 --> 22:46.699
Cassandra and Stone:
Push the button!

22:47.667 --> 22:50.202
- Ah!
- Ah!

22:50.202 --> 22:51.938
( groans )

22:52.739 --> 22:53.940
Jenkins:
Mr. Stone.

22:55.742 --> 22:58.411
Mr. Stone,
can you hear me?

22:58.411 --> 23:00.547
Jenkins.

23:00.547 --> 23:01.681
Where are you?

23:01.681 --> 23:03.450
Trapped, and I'm afraid.

23:03.450 --> 23:04.617
very close to death.

23:04.617 --> 23:06.052
Dark forces
have taken me.

23:06.052 --> 23:08.921
There is a dagger
pressed to my heart.

23:08.921 --> 23:10.356
Wait, wait, wait,
the dagger.

23:10.356 --> 23:11.591
I remember.

23:11.591 --> 23:14.661
Why can't I remember
anything else?

23:14.661 --> 23:16.963
You have been taken to
the Testing Grounds,

23:16.963 --> 23:19.566
a place where memory dies,
yet heroes survive.

23:19.566 --> 23:21.367
What am I supposed
to do here?

23:21.367 --> 23:22.769
I beg of you,
cross the Testing Grounds

23:22.769 --> 23:24.437
and hit the gold button.

23:24.437 --> 23:26.706
You will be returned home
and my life will be saved.

23:27.640 --> 23:28.975
Looks too easy.

23:28.975 --> 23:29.776
What's the catch?

23:29.776 --> 23:31.611
You are not alone.

23:31.611 --> 23:33.079
Two others are here
and they will stop

23:33.079 --> 23:35.748
at nothing to get to
that button first,

23:35.748 --> 23:37.149
even killing
you in the process.

23:37.149 --> 23:38.350
Who are they?

23:38.350 --> 23:40.219
The most worthy
adversaries.

23:40.219 --> 23:41.754
Cunning and dangerous.

23:41.754 --> 23:44.591
They are smart,
skilled, and motivated.

23:44.591 --> 23:46.659
I don't recognize
either one of them.

23:46.659 --> 23:49.095
Stone, my life
is in your hands.

23:49.095 --> 23:50.663
Can I rely on you?

23:50.663 --> 23:52.198
Jenkins,
of course.

23:52.198 --> 23:53.600
I won't let you down.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.367
Whatever it takes.

23:55.367 --> 23:56.469
You're not gonna
die today, Jenkins.

23:56.469 --> 23:58.437
You've been given tools.

23:58.437 --> 24:00.673
Construct them,
use them wisely.

24:00.673 --> 24:02.008
But the clock is ticking.

24:02.008 --> 24:03.776
My life hangs in the balance.

24:03.776 --> 24:06.579
( music playing )

24:21.427 --> 24:24.764
He's turned you
into enemies.

24:26.566 --> 24:28.467
( music playing )

24:28.467 --> 24:30.369
Jenkins:
That is an excellent bow,
Mr. Stone.

24:30.369 --> 24:31.638
( spits )

24:31.638 --> 24:34.373
That's 'cause it's not
my first time.

24:34.373 --> 24:36.242
All right, tell me,

24:36.242 --> 24:37.810
how smart
are these cats?

24:37.810 --> 24:39.378
Their intelligence
is precisely

24:39.378 --> 24:41.213
what makes them so deadly.

24:41.213 --> 24:43.082
Good.

24:43.082 --> 24:46.485
Then I know I'll be
up against the best.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.154
Let's light 'em up.

24:48.154 --> 24:51.423
( music playing )

24:51.423 --> 24:52.825
Oh, no you don't.

24:57.329 --> 24:59.265
- ( rope snaps )
- ( grunting )

25:00.032 --> 25:02.702
( grunting )

25:09.308 --> 25:10.810
That is some
dangerous math.

25:40.406 --> 25:42.208
All I can do is watch.

25:42.208 --> 25:44.510
My nightmare.

25:44.510 --> 25:46.846
Those trapped in their
nightmares cannot see
their Nightmare Rings,

25:46.846 --> 25:49.048
nor even remember
putting them on.

25:52.351 --> 25:53.653
Show me the truth.

26:00.059 --> 26:02.995
Each take a ring
and put it on.

26:12.504 --> 26:15.742
( panting )

26:25.051 --> 26:26.786
( grunts )

26:26.786 --> 26:27.987
( device powers up )

26:57.183 --> 26:58.184
( beep )

27:00.319 --> 27:01.620
( beep )

27:04.090 --> 27:05.024
( grunts )

27:05.024 --> 27:08.227
( music playing )

27:21.741 --> 27:24.176
( glass shatters,
sizzling )

27:35.154 --> 27:37.423
( panting )

27:41.828 --> 27:43.930
( grunts )

27:48.868 --> 27:50.770
- Stop!
- Stop!

27:50.770 --> 27:53.706
Jenkins:
Don't let him press the button,
my life depends upon it!

27:53.706 --> 27:55.708
Don't take another step.
I can't let you
touch that button!

27:55.708 --> 27:58.144
Drop your weapon.

27:58.144 --> 27:59.545
You have no idea
what's at stake here.

27:59.545 --> 28:00.813
I don't have a choice,

28:00.813 --> 28:02.114
I'm giving you
till a count of three!

28:02.114 --> 28:04.150
I'm giving you to
the count of three!

28:06.786 --> 28:09.321
My nightmare is that
I can't help them.

28:09.321 --> 28:10.656
( breathes heavily )

28:10.656 --> 28:13.592
Time to wake up!
( grunts )

28:13.592 --> 28:14.894
( gasps )
Stone...

28:14.894 --> 28:17.429
Cassandra,
Ezekiel, stop! Stop.

28:17.429 --> 28:18.630
I know you.

28:18.630 --> 28:20.632
- Your name's--
- Eve.

28:20.632 --> 28:21.768
Eve Baird.

28:21.768 --> 28:23.836
You're our Guardian.

28:23.836 --> 28:25.738
Stone, Cassandra.

28:25.738 --> 28:27.740
I remember,
we're all Librarians!

28:27.740 --> 28:28.941
The rings, look!

28:34.580 --> 28:36.415
You stopped us.

28:36.415 --> 28:38.184
You saved us.

28:38.184 --> 28:40.286
Yeah.

28:40.286 --> 28:41.487
Jenkins:
No.

28:41.487 --> 28:44.323
She did not.

28:44.323 --> 28:47.293
Only one Librarian can
leave the Trial alive.

28:47.293 --> 28:50.129
Your predicament
remains unchanged.

28:50.129 --> 28:53.199
I will not let you
get away with this!

28:53.199 --> 28:54.500
- ( grunts )
- Oh, please.

28:54.500 --> 28:55.534
( grunts )

28:55.534 --> 28:56.969
Foolish Guardian,

28:56.969 --> 28:59.271
the Harness of Mahakali
cannot be broken.

29:00.539 --> 29:01.941
Then it should be me.

29:04.143 --> 29:07.013
I don't want to live
in a world without Jenkins.

29:08.580 --> 29:11.383
Jake...
shoot me.

29:11.383 --> 29:12.584
N-n-no.

29:12.584 --> 29:14.086
You might as well
shoot me too, then, mate.

29:14.086 --> 29:15.721
You'd make
a great Librarian.

29:15.721 --> 29:18.457
And Jenkins is a million times
more than what I'll ever be.

29:18.457 --> 29:19.458
Listen to me...

29:21.060 --> 29:22.261
I'll take this one.

29:22.261 --> 29:23.762
You both

29:23.762 --> 29:25.531
deserve to be Librarians.

29:25.531 --> 29:26.698
Do it--
do it for Jenkins.

29:26.698 --> 29:28.000
No.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.703
Three dead Librarians are
of no use to me.

29:31.703 --> 29:34.206
Only two must die,
one must live.

29:34.206 --> 29:38.044
So choose,
choose now which two die.

29:38.044 --> 29:40.312
Me.

29:40.312 --> 29:42.281
It should be me,
take my life.

29:43.315 --> 29:45.551
Me. I'm completely
expendable.

29:47.419 --> 29:49.288
- It should be me.
- Stop, stop, stop, stop!

29:49.288 --> 29:52.324
- Everybody stop!
- No!

29:52.324 --> 29:55.161
Choose...
which two die.

29:55.161 --> 29:59.231
Choose,
or I will end Jenkins.

30:02.401 --> 30:05.104
- ( music playing )
- Jenkins: Choose!

30:05.104 --> 30:06.538
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

30:08.007 --> 30:09.942
Before you do this,

30:09.942 --> 30:11.543
there's one thing
I have to know.

30:11.543 --> 30:13.112
What?

30:13.112 --> 30:17.149
This morning,
when Jenkins was still Jenkins,

30:17.149 --> 30:19.551
he made an anchor out of
the First Book of the Library,

30:19.551 --> 30:22.088
he said it would lock any
artifact into place.

30:22.088 --> 30:23.422
My question is this:

30:23.422 --> 30:25.557
is this harness
an artifact?

30:25.557 --> 30:27.259
Yes.

30:27.259 --> 30:29.561
But what does that
have to do with...?

30:29.561 --> 30:31.931
( breathing heavily )

30:31.931 --> 30:34.400
I will not let you
get away with this!

30:34.400 --> 30:36.002
( both grunt )

30:36.002 --> 30:37.669
The First Book.

30:37.669 --> 30:38.804
Your harness
stays here,

30:38.804 --> 30:40.639
- and you come with me!
- Ah!

30:40.639 --> 30:42.341
( electrical buzzing )

30:42.341 --> 30:43.609
( grunts )

30:43.609 --> 30:45.344
( music playing )

30:45.344 --> 30:46.879
( exhales )

30:46.879 --> 30:49.515
Jenkins?

30:49.515 --> 30:50.516
Is that you?

30:52.251 --> 30:55.121
( laughs )
Yes, it is me.

30:55.121 --> 30:57.323
You brought me back.

30:57.323 --> 30:58.557
( whoosh )

30:59.825 --> 31:02.628
You brought them
all back.

31:02.628 --> 31:04.997
You wonderful woman!

31:04.997 --> 31:07.166
You brought us
all home.

31:07.166 --> 31:09.468
- ( crying )
You'll make me cry!
- Oh!

31:09.468 --> 31:10.769
I'm just a Guardian.

31:10.769 --> 31:12.071
Just doing my job.

31:12.071 --> 31:14.406
( chuckles )
No, you are the Guardian.

31:14.406 --> 31:16.008
You are my Guardian.

31:16.008 --> 31:19.045
Our Guardian.
We all owe you our lives.

31:20.913 --> 31:21.914
Everybody good?

31:21.914 --> 31:23.015
We are now.

31:23.015 --> 31:24.683
I'm sorry about the whole

31:24.683 --> 31:26.185
scroll spell thing.

31:26.185 --> 31:28.387
Hey, it's water
under the bridge.

31:28.387 --> 31:31.057
So what do we
do now?

31:31.057 --> 31:33.825
Well, we move on
from this awful day

31:33.825 --> 31:35.794
to something
better and brighter,

31:35.794 --> 31:38.797
something more becoming
of who we are.

31:38.797 --> 31:40.532
Or, to put
it another way:

31:40.532 --> 31:42.768
Librarians together,

31:42.768 --> 31:44.770
Librarians forever.

31:44.770 --> 31:47.073
( whirring )

31:48.140 --> 31:50.409
( rumbling, rattling )

31:56.782 --> 31:58.784
- ( grunts )
- ( gasps )

31:58.784 --> 31:59.986
( grunts )

32:01.353 --> 32:02.154
Ah!

32:02.154 --> 32:03.990
Clear the table!

32:03.990 --> 32:06.258
Get him up on the table!
Get him on the table!

32:06.258 --> 32:08.360
- He's bleeding out.
- ( gasps )

32:08.360 --> 32:10.096
The knife's going
straight into his heart.

32:10.096 --> 32:11.797
Cassandra,
magic, medicine!

32:11.797 --> 32:13.399
- Anything!
- Oh, no!

32:13.399 --> 32:15.367
- ( gasping )
- We have to get
this off of him.

32:15.367 --> 32:16.868
Listen, but, Baird,
there's no way...

32:16.868 --> 32:19.071
I will not lose him!
Ezekiel,

32:19.071 --> 32:20.439
you've got the
steadiest hands.

32:20.439 --> 32:22.041
Ezekiel?

32:22.041 --> 32:24.410
Easy, easy.

32:24.410 --> 32:26.145
Cassandra?

32:26.145 --> 32:27.379
- Cassandra?
- ( metal clanks )

32:27.379 --> 32:28.614
Okay.

32:32.751 --> 32:34.253
( Cassandra panting )

32:34.253 --> 32:35.687
The Shroud of Lazarus

32:35.687 --> 32:36.989
has the ability
to heal

32:36.989 --> 32:38.024
any wound.

32:38.024 --> 32:39.925
I hope!

32:39.925 --> 32:41.027
Jenkins,
can you hear me?

32:41.027 --> 32:42.861
Jenkins!

32:42.861 --> 32:43.996
Jenkins...

32:43.996 --> 32:45.897
It's working.
It's working.

32:45.897 --> 32:47.699
( panting )

32:47.699 --> 32:48.700
Hello.

32:50.269 --> 32:51.970
- Stone: It worked.
- Hi.

32:51.970 --> 32:55.341
- ( laughs )
- Oh.

32:55.341 --> 32:56.575
The Shroud of Lazarus.

32:56.575 --> 32:58.144
I was wondering
where I'd put that.

32:58.144 --> 33:00.046
I found it when
we we had High Tea.

33:00.046 --> 33:03.849
Your cucumber sandwiches.

33:03.849 --> 33:08.320
"Worth becoming mortal for,"
as I recall saying.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.089
You'll have plenty of
cucumber sandwiches.

33:10.089 --> 33:11.590
Eve Baird.

33:11.590 --> 33:13.392
No, this wound

33:13.392 --> 33:17.529
caused by
the Kiss of Mahakali,

33:17.529 --> 33:20.499
no magic can undo
what it's done.

33:20.499 --> 33:22.734
You're getting better,
look at you.

33:22.734 --> 33:25.404
No, it's just...

33:25.404 --> 33:27.406
allowing me to die...

33:27.406 --> 33:28.607
a little more slowly.

33:28.607 --> 33:30.842
Jenkins...

33:30.842 --> 33:32.311
I have had
so much life.

33:32.311 --> 33:35.047
Measured in centuries,

33:35.047 --> 33:37.483
millennia stretching
to infinity.

33:37.483 --> 33:40.419
Now, I'm measured
in heartbeats

33:40.419 --> 33:43.422
decreasing
heartbeats.

33:43.422 --> 33:48.060
Time finally
running... out.

33:48.060 --> 33:50.762
You all must know,
serving you has been

33:50.762 --> 33:52.864
the greatest...

33:52.864 --> 33:54.566
pleasure of my life.

33:54.566 --> 33:58.304
I may have been immortal,
but you brought me to life.

34:04.110 --> 34:05.477
Cassandra Cillian...

34:06.612 --> 34:10.149
your cucumber
sandwiches...

34:11.250 --> 34:13.219
good enough to die for.

34:18.924 --> 34:22.328
( music playing )

34:25.797 --> 34:27.599
( sniffles )

34:32.804 --> 34:34.306
( groans )

35:01.967 --> 35:04.770
- Cassandra...
- ( crying )
I don't want to say anything.

35:04.770 --> 35:07.639
We played the game,

35:07.639 --> 35:09.241
just like the Library
wanted us to.

35:09.241 --> 35:11.777
We beat it.

35:11.777 --> 35:13.179
Yet it still...

35:13.179 --> 35:14.213
I don't want
to be here.

35:14.213 --> 35:16.382
I'm sorry.

35:16.382 --> 35:18.083
I can't be here
ever again.

35:18.083 --> 35:19.151
Cassandra...

35:19.151 --> 35:20.686
No, I gave...

35:20.686 --> 35:22.188
everything I had
to the Library,

35:22.188 --> 35:25.357
I gave it my love,
I gave it my trust,

35:25.357 --> 35:27.058
and it took
Jenkins!

35:27.058 --> 35:28.727
And I hate it!

35:28.727 --> 35:30.762
I hate it!

35:30.762 --> 35:32.331
It took Jenkins.

35:32.331 --> 35:33.732
( sniffs )

35:33.732 --> 35:37.769
I don't trust
this place anymore.

35:37.769 --> 35:40.872
It took Jenkins.

35:40.872 --> 35:43.675
It crossed a line.

35:43.675 --> 35:44.810
I'm done.

35:50.649 --> 35:52.551
Stone:
"I, Jacob Stone,

35:52.551 --> 35:55.086
hereby resign
from the post of Librarian."

35:55.086 --> 35:56.755
Ezekiel:
"I, Ezekiel Jones,

35:56.755 --> 35:58.624
hereby resign from
the post of Librarian."

35:58.624 --> 36:00.125
Cassandra:
"I, Cassandra Cillian,

36:00.125 --> 36:02.628
hereby resign
from the post of Librarian."

36:33.725 --> 36:35.227
( screams )

36:42.301 --> 36:43.502
( glass crunching )

36:45.136 --> 36:47.606
That's seven years'
bad luck.

36:47.606 --> 36:51.843
( music playing )

36:53.845 --> 36:55.847
No...

36:55.847 --> 36:57.649
No.

36:57.649 --> 36:59.217
How?

36:59.217 --> 37:01.787
How? Who?
What? Where?

37:01.787 --> 37:02.754
When? Why?

37:02.754 --> 37:06.258
Oh, look at your
poor little face.

37:06.258 --> 37:07.526
( crying )
This was you?

37:07.526 --> 37:11.229
This has all,
always been me.

37:11.229 --> 37:12.431
Flynn's resignation,

37:12.431 --> 37:15.033
Jenkins's death,
and now,

37:15.033 --> 37:16.735
the end of the
Library itself.

37:16.735 --> 37:18.203
- ( bellows )
- Oh!

37:18.203 --> 37:20.406
( laughs )

37:20.406 --> 37:21.607
Come on, Eve.

37:21.607 --> 37:23.909
You think I came
here to fight!

37:23.909 --> 37:24.976
Look at how
I'm dressed.

37:24.976 --> 37:27.279
Please, you're
creasing the couture.

37:27.279 --> 37:29.748
Tell me what
you've done.

37:29.748 --> 37:31.249
Why should I?

37:31.249 --> 37:35.120
Because I am on the edge
and you do not want to
push me any further.

37:35.120 --> 37:39.291
You know, you actually look
like you could kill me.

37:39.291 --> 37:41.693
Please,
don't hurt me.

37:41.693 --> 37:45.030
I'm just a poor,
weak, little...

37:45.030 --> 37:46.131
( yells )

37:46.131 --> 37:47.799
500-year-old
Guardian.

37:49.735 --> 37:52.404
I don't know what
you're doing, but--

37:52.404 --> 37:55.273
No. No, you don't.

37:55.273 --> 37:56.274
You never have.

37:56.274 --> 37:58.143
Nicole, I will stop you.

37:58.143 --> 37:59.545
Stop me?

37:59.545 --> 38:01.747
You've been
helping me.

38:01.747 --> 38:04.115
I could never have tricked
Jenkins into turning mortal

38:04.115 --> 38:05.651
if it weren't
for you.

38:05.651 --> 38:07.719
Jenkins could never have died
if it weren't for you.

38:07.719 --> 38:10.989
He was right about me
all along.

38:10.989 --> 38:13.024
( gasps )

38:13.024 --> 38:15.694
You were gathering artifacts
to attack the Library.

38:15.694 --> 38:17.929
No, I was
gathering artifacts

38:17.929 --> 38:20.198
to make it look like
I was attacking the Library,

38:20.198 --> 38:21.800
to force Jenkins
to imprison me.

38:21.800 --> 38:24.503
I knew the map would be
uncovered in exactly 100 years.

38:24.503 --> 38:25.904
I knew that you'd
need my help.

38:25.904 --> 38:29.541
And when Flynn
discovered my imprisonment,

38:29.541 --> 38:31.710
I knew he would
begin to question

38:31.710 --> 38:33.712
the legitimacy
of the Library

38:33.712 --> 38:36.848
and his doubt
would be... infectious.

38:36.848 --> 38:39.651
You planted the map
to the cornerstone.

38:39.651 --> 38:43.522
One of the great advantages
of being from the future,

38:43.522 --> 38:46.392
I knew where to leave it
and who would find it.

38:46.392 --> 38:49.327
And, when I
saved the day,

38:49.327 --> 38:51.363
you believed me
to be innocent

38:51.363 --> 38:52.931
of the crimes
against the Library.

38:52.931 --> 38:56.602
And so the seeds
of doubt and distrust were sown.

38:56.602 --> 38:58.970
You could have destroyed
the Library then,

38:58.970 --> 39:00.071
why didn't you?

39:00.071 --> 39:02.574
The Library's existence

39:02.574 --> 39:04.843
depends on Man's
belief in it.

39:04.843 --> 39:07.312
It's their faith in
it that gives it life.

39:07.312 --> 39:08.980
But...

39:11.182 --> 39:13.084
make every
Librarian quit.

39:13.084 --> 39:15.954
If you want to
destroy the Library,

39:15.954 --> 39:19.991
you must destroy
Man's belief in it.

39:19.991 --> 39:22.694
That's why you
didn't kill them.

39:22.694 --> 39:23.895
You had to
break them.

39:23.895 --> 39:26.665
They say
you can kill a man,

39:26.665 --> 39:29.401
but you can't
kill an idea.

39:29.401 --> 39:30.902
I proved the contrary.

39:30.902 --> 39:34.806
I set in motion a series of
events that did just that.

39:34.806 --> 39:38.477
I killed the idea
of the Library.

39:38.477 --> 39:40.178
Where's Flynn?

39:40.178 --> 39:41.680
You're his Guardian...

39:41.680 --> 39:45.851
his immortal
tethering partner,

39:45.851 --> 39:48.620
shouldn't you know
where he is?

39:48.620 --> 39:50.556
Unless-- ooh,

39:50.556 --> 39:52.223
did you drop
the ball again?

39:52.223 --> 39:54.660
Where... is... Flynn?

39:54.660 --> 39:56.161
He's my guest.

39:56.161 --> 39:57.295
Sort of.

39:57.295 --> 39:58.697
Put it this way:

39:58.697 --> 40:02.000
he's in no position to
refuse my hospitality.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.301
Why are you doing this?

40:03.301 --> 40:05.771
Revenge.

40:05.771 --> 40:07.005
Payback.

40:07.005 --> 40:08.774
Your pathetic
ex-boyfriend

40:08.774 --> 40:10.642
trapped me 500 years
in the past,

40:10.642 --> 40:12.444
trying showing up
how clever he was,

40:12.444 --> 40:15.514
and then entirely
failed to rescue me.

40:15.514 --> 40:17.415
First, I waited,

40:17.415 --> 40:19.785
like you do.

40:19.785 --> 40:21.853
My prince will
come someday.

40:21.853 --> 40:24.523
Until, someday,
he didn't.

40:24.523 --> 40:29.394
After the first
hundred years or so,

40:29.394 --> 40:30.629
I got bored
of waiting.

40:30.629 --> 40:33.532
I got bored
of Flynn, too.

40:33.532 --> 40:37.068
And don't get me started on
how I feel about the Library.

40:37.068 --> 40:38.436
( bell chiming )

40:38.436 --> 40:39.505
Here it comes.

40:39.505 --> 40:41.673
The Equinox
of Binding!

40:41.673 --> 40:45.043
Hurry, Eve, find a Librarian
to tether with or--

40:45.043 --> 40:46.478
hmm, too late.

40:46.478 --> 40:48.480
They won't
even remember

40:48.480 --> 40:50.015
they were
Librarians now.

40:50.015 --> 40:52.117
- You can't do this!
- But I have.

40:52.117 --> 40:54.720
The only place
the Library exists now

40:54.720 --> 40:56.588
is in your memories.

40:56.588 --> 40:59.491
And soon, those too
shall begin to fade.

40:59.491 --> 41:01.893
No. No, I will
never forget!

41:01.893 --> 41:03.228
Who's ashes are
in that urn, Eve?

41:04.462 --> 41:05.931
Judson-- uh, J...

41:05.931 --> 41:08.433
- Jenkins. Jenkins!
- One name,

41:08.433 --> 41:10.769
and you could barely
hold onto it.

41:10.769 --> 41:12.604
how are you
going to keep

41:12.604 --> 41:15.173
the whole of this
alive in your mind?

41:15.173 --> 41:17.743
You have failed in
every way imaginable.

41:17.743 --> 41:19.711
Your stupidity,
your arrogance.

41:19.711 --> 41:21.980
Thank you for making
them my greatest allies.

41:21.980 --> 41:24.282
- ( bells chiming )
- ( gasps )

41:24.282 --> 41:26.051
That's it,
on your knees.

41:26.051 --> 41:27.085
Know your place!

41:27.085 --> 41:30.589
Do you like my dress,
by the way?

41:30.589 --> 41:33.525
I've been saving it
for a special occasion.

41:33.525 --> 41:36.762
It's for watching
the world burn.

41:36.762 --> 41:39.197
( music playing )

41:39.197 --> 41:42.200
( panting )

42:02.387 --> 42:05.156
( music playing )

42:13.665 --> 42:16.267
( music playing )
