00:01.347 --> 00:04.426
Previously on "Shut Eye"...
A dear friend told me once

00:04.463 --> 00:06.424
that the universe
is always speaking to us,

00:06.425 --> 00:07.906
Maybe he can help.

00:07.907 --> 00:10.709
You see things, too?
I hear things. Messages.

00:10.710 --> 00:12.591
From the other side?
From everywhere.

00:12.592 --> 00:16.354
From the universe.

00:16.355 --> 00:18.196
I used to make a lot of money
with this deck.

00:18.197 --> 00:20.239
Can you teach me how to do that?

00:28.167 --> 00:29.848
Do you know where she is?
She's gone.

00:29.849 --> 00:31.329
No, I don't.
You don't.

00:31.330 --> 00:35.173
I sense a seeker
who has something to share.

00:35.174 --> 00:38.097
Are you listening?
I am listening.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074

01:00.640 --> 01:02.280
Step right up, folks.

01:02.281 --> 01:05.483
Come witness the greatest
illusionist in all of Las Vegas.

01:05.483 --> 01:07.125
Beautiful flowers for a beautiful

01:07.126 --> 01:08.847
and generous young lady.

01:08.848 --> 01:11.369
Oh, no.
No? They're not real, anyway.

01:11.370 --> 01:15.614
Pretty hot out here. Don't you think?

01:15.615 --> 01:19.057
Ooh, where'd it go?
Must have caught the red-eye.

01:19.058 --> 01:20.939
Ooh, quick return flight, though.

01:20.940 --> 01:24.743
Allow me to introduce to you
the amazing, spectacular,

01:24.744 --> 01:27.826
the stupendous Princess Bunny!

01:28.936 --> 01:32.631
Now, wish Princess Bunny a safe
journey to the fifth dimension.

01:32.632 --> 01:36.075
Sim sala bim...

01:37.076 --> 01:39.958
Whoa!
You're hurting her, Charlie.

01:39.959 --> 01:41.920
My sister's upset
now that Princess Bunny is gone,

01:41.921 --> 01:43.201
so I say we ought to bring her back.

01:43.202 --> 01:45.804
What do you think?
Absolutely.

01:45.805 --> 01:49.288
Say the magic words.
Sim sala bim.

01:51.891 --> 01:54.773
Oh!
Uh, donations are welcome.

01:54.774 --> 01:55.974
Let's give him something.
Anything helps.

01:58.738 --> 02:00.901
Quarter?
Nickel.

02:02.341 --> 02:03.662
You got to work on your lines.

02:03.663 --> 02:05.383
You're supposed to be my assistant.

02:05.384 --> 02:07.903
When's Mom coming back?
Tonight.

02:08.788 --> 02:10.348
I think.

02:16.796 --> 02:18.797
This is fun, huh?

02:18.798 --> 02:20.518
You said you'd be home for dinner.

02:20.519 --> 02:22.240
Well, we are eating dinner, aren't we?

02:22.241 --> 02:25.243
Charlie made me dinner at home.

02:25.244 --> 02:28.126
Well, that is so nice of Charlie.

02:28.127 --> 02:30.328
I thought the plan
was to have a family dinner.

02:30.329 --> 02:33.131
Sylvia was hungry, and you were late.

02:33.132 --> 02:36.575
Not my fault we were delayed
coming out of Kansas City.

02:36.576 --> 02:39.538
Right? Hmm?

02:41.781 --> 02:45.303
Okay. You win.

02:45.304 --> 02:51.109
How about I buy your affection? Huh?

02:51.110 --> 02:58.397
This is for you,
and, Sylvie, this is for you.

02:59.719 --> 03:02.499
Thanks, Mom!

03:03.667 --> 03:05.283
It's from Tannen's.

03:05.284 --> 03:09.287
Duh. It says so on the box.
Don't be a smart ass.

03:09.288 --> 03:12.050
Yeah. What he said.

03:12.051 --> 03:13.635
Awesome.

03:14.293 --> 03:16.575
I saw this in the catalog.

03:16.576 --> 03:20.980
One day, Charlie, I'm gonna
take you to Tannen's. I promise.

03:23.342 --> 03:24.623
Okay.

03:24.624 --> 03:26.104
If you guys are gonna get dessert,

03:26.105 --> 03:27.385
you had better get it now.

03:27.386 --> 03:29.387
You have to leave again?

03:29.388 --> 03:33.151
Mm, I have the 12:03 to LaGuardia.

03:33.152 --> 03:35.554
You know, got to bring home the bacon.

03:43.402 --> 03:45.004
I got to pee.

03:51.530 --> 03:55.093
This is so Madonna.
Isn't it so Madonna, Charlie?

03:55.094 --> 03:57.679
Yeah. Madonna.

03:59.979 --> 04:02.060
I got to pee.
I got to pee, too.

04:02.061 --> 04:04.222
No, you stay here, Sylvie.

04:04.223 --> 04:05.604
Dork.

04:30.837 --> 04:32.852
All right.

04:34.894 --> 04:36.935
What? What's the matter?

04:36.936 --> 04:38.737
I don't think you
should do this anymore.

04:38.738 --> 04:40.819
Do I need to remind you this
is how we put food on the table?

04:40.820 --> 04:42.500
It's how we pay the rent,

04:42.501 --> 04:45.394
not to mention the magic tricks
and the rabbit food.

04:46.105 --> 04:47.786
I know, but...

04:47.787 --> 04:49.948
Look, this is what it means
to be a grown-up. Okay?

04:49.949 --> 04:51.269
Sometimes you have to do stuff
you don't like

04:51.270 --> 04:53.351
to take care of your family.

04:53.352 --> 04:57.957
And I can't do it without you.
You're my secret weapon, right?

05:01.801 --> 05:04.830
Last time, all right? Okay?

05:06.445 --> 05:09.487
Okay, hurry up.
Tie your Sly Stallone knot.

05:10.770 --> 05:12.090
Slydini.

05:12.091 --> 05:15.575
Oh, Slydini. Slydini. I'm gonna get it.

05:18.097 --> 05:20.595
No, no, that's too lose.

05:21.981 --> 05:24.023
Damn it, Charlie, hurry the fuck up.

05:32.471 --> 05:34.113
Okay?
Great.

05:35.995 --> 05:37.696
Okay.

05:39.919 --> 05:41.116
Perfect.

05:42.802 --> 05:44.744
You're my Magic Man, Charlie.

05:46.646 --> 05:48.623
Okay, go.

05:53.172 --> 05:55.614
Princess Bunny has some
very important business

05:55.615 --> 05:57.055
to attend to in the fifth dimension,

05:57.056 --> 06:01.180
so I am going to open a portal for her.

06:03.222 --> 06:04.983
Oh.
Wow.

06:04.984 --> 06:06.892
Sim sala bim!

06:07.867 --> 06:11.790
Oh.

06:11.791 --> 06:14.472
Sylvia?
What?

06:14.473 --> 06:19.758
Um, my sister is very upset
now that Princess Bunny is gone.

06:19.759 --> 06:21.720
She's doing a great job hiding it.

06:21.721 --> 06:23.742
So I'm gonna bring her back.

06:24.283 --> 06:26.444
Sim sala bim.

06:32.732 --> 06:34.920
Holy shit.

07:25.985 --> 07:30.141
Are you listening?
I am listening.

07:31.070 --> 07:33.232
What are you listening for?

07:36.515 --> 07:38.997
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.

07:38.998 --> 07:43.321
All those who wish to commune
with the universe are welcome.

07:43.322 --> 07:46.685
Charlie, are you listening?

07:46.686 --> 07:50.729
You bet.
Then, please, sit.

07:50.730 --> 07:54.292
Join us in dialogue with the universe.

07:54.958 --> 07:56.254
Psst. Hey. Charlie.

07:56.255 --> 08:00.418
I sense a seeker who recently...

08:00.419 --> 08:03.800
Would you mind if I sat next to my wife?

08:05.104 --> 08:09.467
Truth is an absolute of the universe.

08:09.468 --> 08:11.870
It's not something that we can control.

08:11.871 --> 08:13.351
You must be proud of yourself.

08:13.352 --> 08:16.074
Nick and I have been worried sick.

08:16.075 --> 08:17.836
You didn't bring him here.
Of course not.

08:17.837 --> 08:20.038
I left him with Vicki.
We thought you were dead.

08:20.039 --> 08:21.600
If you're deceiving those around you...

08:21.601 --> 08:23.682
Sorry to disappoint.

08:23.683 --> 08:28.246
I'm hearing a voice
bleeding through the ether.

08:28.247 --> 08:31.995
Someone named... Gina.

08:33.011 --> 08:36.214
Now,
I don't know if Gina is someone's mother

08:36.215 --> 08:42.464
or someone's boat,
but she has a message.

08:43.743 --> 08:47.026
Is someone here listening
for this message?

08:57.877 --> 09:00.679
Would you like to hear her message?

09:00.680 --> 09:01.840
Maybe she doesn't want to talk about it.

09:01.841 --> 09:06.605
Maybe not, but let's ask her.

09:06.606 --> 09:07.906
Linda?

09:08.447 --> 09:10.533
It's okay. She's a friend.

09:11.410 --> 09:15.934
Gina has transformed to the next phase?

09:15.935 --> 09:18.297
If you're asking if she's dead,
then yes.

09:26.826 --> 09:29.548
She wants you to know
that she did deceive you.

09:33.032 --> 09:35.225
But she wants you to know...

09:37.797 --> 09:39.688
that she loved you.

09:41.400 --> 09:43.802
Thank you for sharing that with me.

09:43.803 --> 09:45.527
I am but a conduit.

09:46.766 --> 09:50.408
I am heartened by your share, Linda.

09:50.409 --> 09:52.410
I hope that there will be many more.

09:52.411 --> 09:57.215
The universe has much to say to you,
as it does to all of us.

09:57.216 --> 10:01.339
I am listening.
That concludes our evening.

10:01.340 --> 10:03.421
Now, remember,
when you leave this circle,

10:03.422 --> 10:06.172
you enter into Reflection Time.

10:06.545 --> 10:11.549
Silence until sunrise
while we contemplate the wisdom

10:11.550 --> 10:14.233
of what the universe
has shared with us today.

10:17.396 --> 10:20.719
Linda. Linda.

10:20.720 --> 10:22.761
Do you want cucumber water?

10:22.762 --> 10:25.403
Cucumber water?

10:25.404 --> 10:27.566
Look, I didn't know she was here
until I got here, okay?

10:27.567 --> 10:29.320
But I'm glad you came.

10:31.611 --> 10:35.013
This could change your life
if you let it, but no one,

10:35.014 --> 10:37.375
in...
including me, is forcing you to stay.

10:37.376 --> 10:40.338
All right.
Really? Okay.

10:40.339 --> 10:43.209
Well, then, I'll help you check in.
Come on.

10:43.703 --> 10:45.824
Look, I'm not gonna harass you
the whole time, okay?

10:45.825 --> 10:47.826
But I just...
I'm gonna give it one more go.

10:47.827 --> 10:50.068
Whatever we do here,
whatever Paz suggests,

10:50.069 --> 10:51.590
no matter how uncomfortable
it makes you feel,

10:51.591 --> 10:53.231
especially if it makes
you feel uncomfortable,

10:53.232 --> 10:54.873
I just want you to try it.
It's not gonna kill you.

10:54.874 --> 10:56.474
Okay, doc.
Okay.

10:56.475 --> 10:58.516
Uh, Maggie, this is Charlie Haverford...

10:58.517 --> 11:00.158
Ooh.
...Linda's husband.

11:00.159 --> 11:01.840
Charlie, Maggie.

11:01.841 --> 11:05.163
We are so pleased you could join us.

11:05.164 --> 11:08.927
Thank you.
Yeah. Okay.

11:08.928 --> 11:10.889
Well, you already missed a day,

11:10.890 --> 11:13.491
but although all
our activities are voluntary,

11:13.492 --> 11:15.293
the pass is all-inclusive.

11:15.294 --> 11:19.017
So we encourage you to have
as much fun as you can handle.

11:19.018 --> 11:20.997
How many of these do you move a week?

11:21.661 --> 11:23.862
At the moment,
I'm only concerned with moving you

11:23.863 --> 11:25.543
through the check-in process,

11:25.544 --> 11:27.345
unless you'd like
to purchase something first.

11:27.346 --> 11:29.628
Uh, a little rich for my blood.

11:29.629 --> 11:31.109
Do you have any fridge magnets?

11:31.110 --> 11:35.594
Oh, better yet,
have you thought about Paz Pez?

11:35.595 --> 11:39.474
I mean, if you haven't,
you're missing a big opportunity there.

11:40.439 --> 11:42.200
With me, please.

11:42.201 --> 11:45.043
Can you make sure that I'm
in the same tent as my wife?

11:45.044 --> 11:47.525
Oh, I am sorry,
but men and women are kept separate

11:47.526 --> 11:48.887
until sunrise.

11:48.888 --> 11:51.169
I thought it was silence until sunrise.

11:51.170 --> 11:53.652
You've got a lot of rules.

11:53.653 --> 11:56.094
Each detail of your stay
is curated by Paz

11:56.095 --> 11:58.937
to deepen your understanding
of one's place in the universe.

11:58.938 --> 12:00.218
Mm.

12:00.219 --> 12:03.262
And right now your place is here.

12:09.869 --> 12:12.551
Medium?
Large.

12:16.075 --> 12:18.556
Here are your new clothes.

12:18.557 --> 12:19.931
And my new self.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.683
Shedding the connections to home
helps shed the attachment

12:24.684 --> 12:26.204
to what may be holding us back

12:26.205 --> 12:28.481
from the expression of our true selves.

12:29.569 --> 12:32.691
I see you have experience.
A little.

12:32.692 --> 12:35.814
You can put your belongings
in any of our secure lockers.

12:35.815 --> 12:37.455
Uh, don't forget to set your pass code.

12:37.456 --> 12:40.138
Oh,
and be sure to include your cellphone

12:40.139 --> 12:42.741
and any of your worldly conventions.

12:42.742 --> 12:43.982
What if I need to make a call?

12:43.983 --> 12:45.904
Oh, you won't.

12:45.905 --> 12:48.226
What if there's an emergency here?

12:48.227 --> 12:50.253
Are you planning on causing one?

12:52.632 --> 12:54.512
You can come to me
or any of the associates

12:54.513 --> 12:56.554
if there is anything that you need.

12:56.555 --> 12:58.356
Shall I leave you to it?

13:40.079 --> 13:41.640
Hey, troublemaker.

13:41.641 --> 13:43.682
I can't stop thinking about last night.

13:43.683 --> 13:46.404
I can still feel your teeth on my skin

13:48.287 --> 13:50.448
You better be on your way
over to do it again.

13:50.449 --> 13:53.653
Think of nothing but me
till you get here.

14:21.761 --> 14:23.441
So, I said, "Sim sala bim," like always,

14:23.442 --> 14:28.326
and then I opened the box
and a big black raven flies out.

14:28.327 --> 14:29.648
It scared the crap out of me.

14:29.649 --> 14:31.009
Charlie said "crap."

14:31.010 --> 14:32.811
I'm old enough to say "crap," okay?

14:32.812 --> 14:35.373
Anyway, it was weird because
I was the only one that saw it,

14:35.374 --> 14:37.736
but I swear there was this raven.

14:37.737 --> 14:40.298
It was there one minute,
and then it was just gone.

14:46.986 --> 14:50.665
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
So it was, uh, not a rabbit anymore?

14:51.390 --> 14:52.709
It's a raven?

14:53.512 --> 14:55.433
No, Princess Bunny was still in the box.

14:55.434 --> 14:57.716
II just saw a raven fly out.

14:57.717 --> 14:59.557
Oh, okay. So you're just seeing things.

14:59.558 --> 15:01.300
Yeah. No.

15:02.521 --> 15:04.843
It was so real.
It was crap.

15:04.844 --> 15:07.085
Hey, you know what, Charlie's
not the only one in this family

15:07.086 --> 15:09.248
who's seen things. Happened to me once.

15:19.899 --> 15:26.264
It was late one summer night,
way too hot to sleep.

15:26.265 --> 15:30.108
So I was lying in bed
in the dark wide awake.

15:30.109 --> 15:32.751
And, uh, Grannie was staying with us.

15:32.752 --> 15:35.113
That's your great-grandmother.

15:35.114 --> 15:37.876
She was, um... She was sick again.

15:37.877 --> 15:40.599
And she'd fallen asleep
on the sofa with the TV on.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.801
But it was so late that station
had already signed off.

15:42.802 --> 15:46.444
So I could hear, you know,
that static from my room.

15:46.445 --> 15:48.607
So I got up out of bed
and went into the parlor

15:48.608 --> 15:52.018
to shut the TV off, and then I, um...

15:52.932 --> 15:58.024
pulled a-a blanket over her 'cause sh...
she was shivering.

15:58.818 --> 16:04.072
And, um, anyway, I went back to my room,
and I'm not kidding...

16:04.784 --> 16:06.144
one of my dolls

16:06.145 --> 16:08.493
that I kept up on a bookshelf

16:09.589 --> 16:12.163
was lying in my bed.

16:13.633 --> 16:15.714
Creepy.
What kind of doll?

16:15.715 --> 16:18.116
A creepy one. She was missing an eye.

16:18.117 --> 16:19.718
Oh, and she was missing one of her arms.

16:19.719 --> 16:21.319
Ew.

16:21.320 --> 16:22.681
I may have performed
some major surgery on her,

16:22.682 --> 16:24.482
but that is another story.

16:24.483 --> 16:27.806
The thing is I still can't
figure out how that doll

16:27.807 --> 16:30.515
got from the bookshelf into the bed.

16:31.410 --> 16:34.773
Maybe you had an earthquake.
Well, not in Virginia.

16:34.774 --> 16:37.605
But, guys, this is the weirder thing.

16:38.537 --> 16:42.662
When I went to pick it up
and put it back on the shelf...

16:44.744 --> 16:48.867
I swear that doll talked to me.

16:48.868 --> 16:50.990
What did she say?
It said...

16:54.273 --> 16:55.665
"She knows."

16:57.757 --> 17:00.479
Wh... Wh...
What does that mean?

17:03.723 --> 17:05.443
Were there other times
that it talked to you?

17:05.444 --> 17:09.087
Charlie,
every kid imagines crazy things, okay?

17:09.088 --> 17:12.210
Our minds play tricks
on us all the time.

17:12.211 --> 17:15.017
We see the things
that we are most scared of,

17:15.694 --> 17:18.020
or we see the things
we most want to see.

17:19.417 --> 17:20.618
It's our brains, you know,

17:20.619 --> 17:22.540
showing us what it would be like...

17:22.540 --> 17:28.227
that it wouldn't be so scary or
so great if it really happened.

17:31.550 --> 17:35.634
Shit! Fuck! Sorry.

17:35.635 --> 17:37.436
I got to pee.

17:47.727 --> 17:49.167
Jesus, Mom.

17:49.168 --> 17:51.930
What took you so fucking long?

17:51.931 --> 17:54.332
Don't start with me.

17:54.333 --> 17:56.134
You said it was the last time.

17:56.135 --> 17:57.576
It is the last time.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.978
You said that last time
and the time before that.

17:59.979 --> 18:03.983
So don't make me keep saying it.

18:05.184 --> 18:07.153
I'll stop doing magic.

18:09.028 --> 18:11.549
Charlie, I'm trying to keep
our heads above water here.

18:11.550 --> 18:14.833
It's not up for discussion. Get to work.

18:14.834 --> 18:16.956
Come on.

18:29.208 --> 18:31.844
Mm-kay?

18:32.812 --> 18:35.294
Oh, shit! I forgot your presents.

18:39.939 --> 18:41.620
Thanks.
All right.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.221
I got to run, baby.

18:43.222 --> 18:45.504
What about Sylvia?
The sunglasses are for her.

18:47.947 --> 18:49.908
Just tell her I love her.
Mom, I...

18:49.909 --> 18:51.870
I can't take her crying right now.

18:51.871 --> 18:53.351
You're better with her than I am,
anyway.

18:59.478 --> 19:01.800
Psst. Hey.

19:01.801 --> 19:04.242
Hey. Hey, Chuckie. Hey.

19:04.243 --> 19:08.086
Psst. Hi. Hi.

19:08.087 --> 19:10.883
Rise and shine, Sleeping Beauty.

19:11.530 --> 19:12.891
W-What are we doing now?

19:12.892 --> 19:15.493
Shh. Still silent time.

19:15.494 --> 19:17.976
You're talking.
I'm a rebel.

19:17.977 --> 19:20.819
Now, don't be scared.

19:20.820 --> 19:23.902
I'll be your personal guide
to the festivities, okay?

19:23.903 --> 19:27.066
Come on. Come on.

19:30.509 --> 19:33.111
Big guy, little yurt, huh?

19:40.559 --> 19:41.720
Ooh.

19:41.721 --> 19:43.361
What is that?
Tempeh bacon.

19:43.362 --> 19:45.844
Jesus, don't you live in L. A.?
It's really good.

19:45.845 --> 19:47.566
Where's the coffee?
No coffee.

19:47.567 --> 19:49.367
What are the mugs for?

19:49.368 --> 19:50.798
Branding.

19:59.579 --> 20:00.933
Ooh!

20:02.541 --> 20:06.344
Hey.
Whoo! Jump in. Water's fine.

20:06.345 --> 20:08.947
Actually, it's fucking freezing.

20:08.948 --> 20:10.949
But it's invigorating.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.490
While we spend most of our time

20:32.491 --> 20:35.654
bridging the gaps
between our differences,

20:35.655 --> 20:40.218
it is also powerful
to feel that distance,

20:40.219 --> 20:44.142
to allow the pull between
the poles to grow,

20:44.143 --> 20:49.547
to feel the opposing energies
of night and day,

20:49.548 --> 20:55.313
of woman and man, of music and silence.

20:55.314 --> 21:00.558
And just as night and
day merge together,

21:00.559 --> 21:07.750
so do we merge our energies
back into one.

21:08.527 --> 21:10.048
Music!

21:25.424 --> 21:28.426
Everybody cut loose, Charlie. Come on.

21:28.427 --> 21:30.949
One, two, three!
Whoo!

21:51.530 --> 21:53.772
She was eight years older than me,

21:53.773 --> 21:56.615
and she was more of a mom to me
than our own mom.

21:56.616 --> 22:01.554
She was a sugar high
packed into a 16-year-old girl.

22:02.301 --> 22:04.142
And when she was on
the other side of the seesaw,

22:04.143 --> 22:05.724
she would, um...

22:07.306 --> 22:09.307
she would disappear
into her room and shut the door

22:09.308 --> 22:12.150
and tell my parents
not to let me see her.

22:12.151 --> 22:14.753
She started to spend more
and more time in there

22:14.754 --> 22:18.597
until she was spending
all of her time in there.

22:18.598 --> 22:22.240
And then... one day, I don't...
I don't know.

22:22.241 --> 22:24.452
I guess it just got to be too dark.

22:25.565 --> 22:29.849
And she, uh,
opened her veins in the bathtub.

22:32.211 --> 22:34.413
It was a Wednesday.

22:35.975 --> 22:37.777
I don't know why I know that.

22:44.864 --> 22:47.506
I know I've asked you before, but, um...

22:50.870 --> 22:52.605
have you heard from her?

22:56.716 --> 22:57.693
No.

22:59.478 --> 23:01.489
It's okay.

23:05.765 --> 23:08.326
I became a neurologist
because I wanted to understand

23:08.327 --> 23:11.731
what goes on in the brain...
in her brain.

23:14.053 --> 23:17.375
But what is going on up here
is as full of mystery

23:17.376 --> 23:18.857
as the rest of the universe.

23:20.740 --> 23:22.661
And one of those mysteries

23:22.662 --> 23:24.583
is whether there's
a genetic predisposition

23:24.584 --> 23:25.944
to bipolar disorder.

23:25.945 --> 23:27.185
I've been thinking about that a lot

23:27.186 --> 23:29.934
since I found out that I'm pregnant.

23:31.030 --> 23:33.351
What if my sister's last message to me

23:33.352 --> 23:36.554
was that life is just too painful,

23:36.555 --> 23:37.756
you know, to make it worth it?

23:37.757 --> 23:39.401
And what if...

23:40.039 --> 23:44.365
my baby has the same illness
that made her feel that way.

23:45.765 --> 23:49.995
I have not heard from your sister, Nora,

23:51.090 --> 23:55.735
but I have heard from your child.

23:59.418 --> 24:01.840
And the voice that I have heard

24:02.782 --> 24:09.108
is of a happy, healthy little boy.

24:13.392 --> 24:14.812
Thank you.

24:15.955 --> 24:19.798
Thank you for sharing, Nora.

24:19.799 --> 24:25.489
Sorry.

24:36.656 --> 24:38.817
Okay, shake it out! Shake it out!

24:38.818 --> 24:40.659
Shake it out! Come on!

24:40.660 --> 24:43.822
Come on!

24:43.823 --> 24:46.224
We're shaking it out!
We're shaking it out! Reset.

24:46.225 --> 24:48.146
We have a lot of work to do, okay?

24:48.147 --> 24:52.270
Who is ready to listen?

24:52.271 --> 24:53.767
I think I'm ready.

24:54.794 --> 24:56.353
Charlie.

24:57.476 --> 25:00.839
What are you listening for?

25:00.840 --> 25:02.641
Well,
I'm not sure what I'm listening for,

25:02.642 --> 25:05.764
but after listening to you,
don't take this the wrong way,

25:05.765 --> 25:10.284
but something about you reminds me...

25:11.410 --> 25:12.851
of my dad.

25:12.852 --> 25:15.694
Charlie.
It's okay, Linda.

25:15.695 --> 25:20.459
Have you heard from him?
He's, uh, changed phase.

25:24.103 --> 25:28.387
Now,
I sense that you're not being truthful.

25:30.469 --> 25:32.264
It's not unusual.

25:32.912 --> 25:38.476
In fact, everyone is resistant at first.

25:38.477 --> 25:41.039
So in spite of your resistance,

25:41.040 --> 25:43.882
I hear that there is something

25:43.883 --> 25:46.926
you really do want to share with us.

25:51.050 --> 25:53.371
Maybe it'd be a little easier

25:53.372 --> 25:55.975
to tell you if we had some privacy?

26:01.741 --> 26:04.222
Please, friends,
forgive the breach of protocol,

26:04.223 --> 26:06.746
but may we have the room?

26:08.948 --> 26:12.551
Thank you. Thank you.

26:14.794 --> 26:16.435
Thank you.

26:27.767 --> 26:30.208
This is really great
what you got going here.

26:30.209 --> 26:32.971
I get it, and I respect it, even.

26:32.972 --> 26:34.733
I wouldn't want you to come to my shop

26:34.734 --> 26:39.123
and tell my customers
that my crystals are just rocks.

26:39.939 --> 26:45.223
But you're fucking with my wife, Paz,

26:45.224 --> 26:47.381
and I can't let that happen.

26:48.267 --> 26:51.389
Look how resistant you are
to what I can offer you.

26:51.390 --> 26:53.071
I understand why.

26:53.072 --> 26:56.034
Look, I know better than most
what it's like to realize

26:56.035 --> 26:58.276
that you're different
from everybody else.

26:58.277 --> 27:00.398
You and I... We're kindred spirits.

27:00.399 --> 27:02.080
Yeah, I'm not seeing that.

27:02.081 --> 27:04.162
We both help people
who are spiritually distressed.

27:04.163 --> 27:05.684
Oh, you're running a charity here.

27:05.685 --> 27:07.085
It's my profession.

27:07.086 --> 27:09.207
I don't hide it.
The price is on the ticket.

27:09.208 --> 27:12.050
You need an extra-large ticket
to fit that price.

27:14.533 --> 27:17.244
Well, the money makes people
take it seriously.

27:17.737 --> 27:20.218
You didn't pay.
Maybe that's why you're so resistant.

27:20.219 --> 27:22.260
No, I just see through your schtick.

27:22.261 --> 27:24.418
I'm not hiding anything.

27:25.504 --> 27:27.145
But you...
Me? Yeah.

27:27.146 --> 27:29.868
Tell me, Columbo,
what is it you think I'm hiding?

27:29.869 --> 27:35.313
Pain. Fear. And a lot of guilt.

27:35.314 --> 27:38.557
So much guilt you are drowning in it.

27:39.518 --> 27:41.059
What do you see in me?

27:42.321 --> 27:45.814
Just a man.
Good. That's all I am.

27:46.405 --> 27:48.406
But people listen to you.
People listen to you.

27:48.407 --> 27:50.488
No, no, no, no, no. Not like you.

27:50.489 --> 27:53.812
I mean, you got Dr. Nora
eating out of your hand.

27:53.813 --> 27:57.335
No. If only.
What does that mean?

27:57.336 --> 27:59.536
Uh...
What?

28:00.820 --> 28:04.022
What?

28:04.023 --> 28:06.024
She called me a few weeks ago, and...

28:06.025 --> 28:08.306
Well, about you, actually.

28:08.307 --> 28:10.068
But she shared that she was pregnant.

28:10.069 --> 28:11.751
And...

28:16.235 --> 28:18.430
I asked her to marry me.

28:19.038 --> 28:21.319
Is it your baby?
No.

28:21.320 --> 28:22.921
But I wanted to raise it with her.

28:22.922 --> 28:25.163
What did she say?
She said that I was

28:25.164 --> 28:28.167
more valuable to her
as a guru than as a husband.

28:30.970 --> 28:34.853
Hey, who knows? Maybe she's right. See?

28:34.854 --> 28:36.824
I get my heart broken.

28:38.698 --> 28:40.338
I'm just like everyone else.

28:40.339 --> 28:42.621
Then how are you hearing voices
from the dead?

28:42.622 --> 28:44.342
How are you seeing your visions?

28:44.343 --> 28:45.824
I don't know. I fell recently.

28:45.825 --> 28:47.225
That's not how.
Okay.

28:47.226 --> 28:48.587
I was kicked in the head recently.

28:48.588 --> 28:50.268
Do you think that's when it started?

28:50.269 --> 28:54.193
Because I started hearing things
when I was 8 years old.

28:57.678 --> 29:00.238
I don't know. I think, uh...

29:00.239 --> 29:04.522
I might have seen some things as a kid,

29:04.523 --> 29:06.044
or, you know, maybe imagined them.

29:06.045 --> 29:08.126
I mean, every kid sees crazy things.

29:08.127 --> 29:11.009
Sure. Maybe you imagined all of them.

29:11.010 --> 29:12.611
Maybe I imagined hearing Gina.

29:12.612 --> 29:17.255
Maybe I imagined that
when you brought up your father,

29:17.256 --> 29:22.786
you really did want to talk about him,
but I don't think so.

29:23.983 --> 29:26.946
You were right about one thing.
About my guilt.

29:29.108 --> 29:30.669
I do feel guilty.

29:32.952 --> 29:34.339
I hear that.

29:36.355 --> 29:39.636
Yeah, but not just from you.

29:40.840 --> 29:42.441
I hear that...

29:46.325 --> 29:49.768
something is wrong with the marker

29:49.769 --> 29:54.492
at your father's resting place,
and you feel responsible.

30:02.982 --> 30:04.661
You trust me now?

30:05.785 --> 30:11.310
Actually,
I need you to trust me and follow me.

30:17.356 --> 30:20.238
Oh, oh, I'm sorry, but can I help you?

30:20.239 --> 30:22.080
I need to show Paz
something in my locker.

30:22.081 --> 30:23.642
Paz feels very strongly

30:23.643 --> 30:25.283
that when we sever
our ties with the outs...

30:25.284 --> 30:26.605
I feel very strongly

30:26.606 --> 30:28.246
about showing Paz something on my phone.

30:28.247 --> 30:29.888
I'm afraid that's not possible.

30:29.889 --> 30:32.731
It's fine, Maggie.
Respectfully, Paz, it is not.

30:32.732 --> 30:35.133
You didn't set these rules arbitrarily.

30:35.134 --> 30:37.495
They're essential for you to be
able to do your work properly.

30:37.496 --> 30:39.377
You're acting like you have
something to hide.

30:39.378 --> 30:41.419
And you are acting
like a bloody lunatic.

30:41.420 --> 30:45.944
Okay, why don't we
all just take a breath, hmm?

30:45.945 --> 30:47.871
It's fine. Come on.

30:48.507 --> 30:50.069
Paz.

30:57.837 --> 31:01.677
Take a look at the last
text message I received.

31:02.842 --> 31:06.444
It's a Grubhub order at 12:04
last night. Looks like pizza.

31:06.445 --> 31:08.183
No, the one before that.

31:11.010 --> 31:13.852
It's Nick asking if he can order pizza.

31:13.853 --> 31:15.855
From my wife.

31:20.112 --> 31:22.702
But...
Are we finished here?

31:44.283 --> 31:45.971
Thank you for joining me.

31:47.326 --> 31:52.010
Some people have trouble with
honesty in front of a crowd.

31:52.011 --> 31:53.411
Well, me and honesty have always had

31:53.412 --> 31:55.854
a bit of a rocky relationship.

31:55.855 --> 31:58.136
Well, then I imagine that
your other relationships

31:58.137 --> 32:00.178
must be rocky, as well.

32:00.179 --> 32:02.100
You want to talk about Charlie.

32:02.101 --> 32:05.103
I want to talk about Linda.

32:05.104 --> 32:07.265
And I get the sense that you don't.

32:07.266 --> 32:10.108
You don't have to be able to
hear the universe to sense that.

32:13.272 --> 32:14.583
Okay.

32:15.474 --> 32:20.399
If you don't want to talk about Linda,
tell me about Gina.

32:26.766 --> 32:29.087
She was a hypnotist.
Hmm.

32:29.088 --> 32:32.571
I was a wife. It was brief.

32:32.572 --> 32:35.093
Those are facts. Facts are boring.

32:36.188 --> 32:38.937
You asked about her.

32:38.938 --> 32:44.342
I asked you to tell me about her.
Try again.

32:44.343 --> 32:47.787
And this time, don't be afraid.

32:53.512 --> 32:58.157
It was supposed to just be sex.

33:00.559 --> 33:02.714
But it took me by surprise.

33:03.840 --> 33:05.965
She took me by surprise.

33:10.449 --> 33:13.266
It's not like there's something
missing with Charlie.

33:14.934 --> 33:16.816
There's something missing in me.

33:19.378 --> 33:23.903
And maybe... maybe I saw it in Gina.

33:27.707 --> 33:32.828
Then she died.
I've been carrying this weight.

33:34.233 --> 33:35.754
A lot of guilt.

33:35.755 --> 33:39.198
Guilt... is not as heavy as love.

33:41.480 --> 33:47.165
You must admit that you carry
love in your heart for Gina.

33:48.447 --> 33:49.968
I know you deceived your husband,

33:49.969 --> 33:51.610
and you feel guilty, yes,

33:51.611 --> 33:56.696
but you have been deceiving
yourself since she died.

34:00.219 --> 34:02.220
I feel like she's haunting me.

34:02.221 --> 34:04.222
She's not haunting you,

34:04.223 --> 34:11.029
but you can't have closure until
you acknowledge your feelings.

34:11.030 --> 34:14.552
What would happen if you let go of Gina?

34:14.553 --> 34:16.329
Where would that leave you?

34:18.638 --> 34:20.839
With what I have now?
And what is that?

34:20.840 --> 34:24.002
Charlie? What is wrong with that?

34:24.003 --> 34:26.804
There's nothing wrong with Charlie.
I love him.

34:26.806 --> 34:29.426
Then why don't you
believe in him anymore?

34:30.810 --> 34:32.130
I believe in him.

34:32.130 --> 34:34.172
Why don't you believe in him anymore?

34:34.172 --> 34:35.574
It's not that. I-It's just...

34:35.574 --> 34:38.376
Why do you not believe in him anymore?

34:38.377 --> 34:41.179
Oh, God. He just keeps fucking up!

34:44.463 --> 34:46.400
He fucks up.

34:48.467 --> 34:51.239
He makes these promises...
Mm.

34:52.311 --> 34:54.618
and I want to believe them.

34:56.755 --> 34:59.247
I want them to be true.

35:10.810 --> 35:12.450
Aren't you loving this place?

35:12.451 --> 35:15.533
My chakras are so fucking aligned.

35:15.534 --> 35:17.455
Or is it open? Maybe both!

35:17.456 --> 35:19.057
I mean, point is,

35:19.058 --> 35:21.620
is my chakras haven't felt this good in,
like, ages.

35:21.621 --> 35:23.261
And Paz is a real miracle worker.

35:23.262 --> 35:24.903
Listen, Marty,
I don't want to burst your bubble,

35:24.904 --> 35:27.400
but Paz is, uh...

35:27.947 --> 35:31.469
Not all spiritual advisers
are as honest as I am.

35:31.470 --> 35:33.431
Charlie, don't be jealous, seriously.

35:33.432 --> 35:35.033
There's room for both of you in my life.

35:35.034 --> 35:36.201
Okay?

35:36.555 --> 35:39.357
I'm glad to hear that.
Oh, my God.

35:39.358 --> 35:43.521
Charlie, you should do seminars.
You'd be great at it.

35:43.522 --> 35:45.123
Maybe get you, like,
a peasant shirt, judo pants...

35:45.124 --> 35:48.887
Can I have a word?
Yes.

35:48.888 --> 35:50.423
Excuse me.

35:51.450 --> 35:55.373
Sorry. Ooh, falafel balls.

35:55.374 --> 36:00.498
Look, I put myself on the line
with Paz for you and Linda.

36:00.499 --> 36:03.622
I didn't ask you to do that.
Well, actually, L-Linda did.

36:03.623 --> 36:06.224
And you're embarrassing both of us,
and yourself, if you care.

36:06.225 --> 36:07.706
You know what I do.

36:07.707 --> 36:09.628
How could you not think
I'd see through his act?

36:09.629 --> 36:12.070
It's not an act.
Come on.

36:12.071 --> 36:13.992
His act is classic mentalist.

36:13.993 --> 36:16.434
It's like he watched The
Amazing Dunninger on YouTube.

36:16.435 --> 36:18.326
He can talk to the dead.

36:19.995 --> 36:23.481
He reads our e-mails,
and he does a background check.

36:23.482 --> 36:25.363
Why, because that's the way you do it?

36:25.364 --> 36:28.406
Just because you're a criminal
does not mean that everyone is.

36:28.407 --> 36:29.848
How could he have known about Gina?

36:32.612 --> 36:34.893
How did you know I was pregnant?

36:34.894 --> 36:36.855
Are your visions fake?
No.

36:36.856 --> 36:38.817
Right, so you're, what,
the only one in the world

36:38.818 --> 36:40.018
who can see things other people can't?

36:40.019 --> 36:41.860
You're the only special one?

36:41.861 --> 36:46.825
I saw a girl. My vision of your baby...
you had a daughter.

36:46.826 --> 36:49.232
So one of us is wrong.

36:50.670 --> 36:53.191
How do you know it's him?
Because if I had to bet...

36:53.192 --> 36:56.394
Because there's no other
explanation for what he's doing.

36:56.395 --> 37:00.478
There are more things in heaven
and earth, Horatio,

37:00.479 --> 37:03.496
than are dreamt of in your philosophy.

37:04.804 --> 37:06.805
Sorry, I didn't mean to sneak up on you.

37:06.806 --> 37:09.808
It's fine. I'm just talking
about you behind your back.

37:09.809 --> 37:12.291
Good. Now you can talk to my face.

37:14.894 --> 37:17.260
You're preying on my wife.

37:17.737 --> 37:21.499
Linda is working very hard
to open herself up

37:21.500 --> 37:23.141
to radical honesty.

37:26.225 --> 37:29.428
I'm losing hope that
you're willing to do the same.

37:31.591 --> 37:33.592
Try me.

38:00.620 --> 38:02.020
You didn't join me.

38:02.021 --> 38:04.022
I was waiting for "Stairway to Heaven."

38:08.427 --> 38:12.911
Well, I would gladly chant
Led Zeppelin if you'd like.

38:12.912 --> 38:15.473
I'm good. Now what?
That's up to you.

38:15.474 --> 38:17.716
No, actually, Paz, it's up to you.

38:17.717 --> 38:20.600
Give me your radical honesty, man.
I'm ready.

38:22.842 --> 38:24.482
I'm confused as to why you're here.

38:24.483 --> 38:26.204
I'm here to protect my wife.

38:26.205 --> 38:30.208
From what? From the truth?
What are you trying to hide?

38:30.209 --> 38:33.972
Uh, nothing.
I'm letting it all hang out.

38:33.973 --> 38:35.380
Hardly.

38:35.895 --> 38:37.465
You know what I see?

38:37.977 --> 38:41.179
Pretense, defensiveness, bullshit.

38:41.180 --> 38:43.461
All I can see is a con man.

38:43.462 --> 38:44.863
Just because you can't read me

38:44.864 --> 38:46.585
doesn't mean I'm trying to deceive you.

38:46.586 --> 38:49.828
Not everyone is trying to
take advantage of you, Charlie.

38:49.829 --> 38:53.311
Oh. What do you want from me, Paz?

38:53.312 --> 38:55.674
I want you to lose control.

38:55.675 --> 38:57.676
You won't dance. You won't share.

38:57.677 --> 38:59.477
You won't do anything.

38:59.478 --> 39:00.999
And you stay here for your wife,

39:01.000 --> 39:02.961
and that's what she
would want you to do.

39:02.962 --> 39:05.724
For fuck's sake, just unclench.

39:05.725 --> 39:10.649
Unclench? Is that what this is for?

39:10.650 --> 39:17.616
This is a spiritual place.
This is a sacred place.

39:17.617 --> 39:19.537
This is a sauna.

39:19.538 --> 39:22.020
In some cultures,
it is the place of transition.

39:22.021 --> 39:23.822
Women come here to give birth.

39:23.823 --> 39:26.224
The dead pass on,

39:26.225 --> 39:27.706
lingering sometimes a moment

39:27.707 --> 39:29.027
to commune with the living.

39:29.028 --> 39:32.103
You see, I think that you and I...

39:33.312 --> 39:36.154
are connected to this in-between realm.

39:36.155 --> 39:39.838
And what is this in-between
realm trying to tell me?

39:39.839 --> 39:44.563
I am desperate to know.
It's why I wanted to meet you.

39:44.564 --> 39:47.869
It's why I wanted to learn from you.

39:48.648 --> 39:51.164
So far,
you've been quite a disappointment.

39:51.891 --> 39:54.733
Sorry, Paz. I'm not here for you.

39:54.734 --> 39:56.254
I'm here to protect my family.

39:59.579 --> 40:01.780
You fucker!
Bullshit!

40:01.781 --> 40:04.222
This is not about protecting anyone.

40:04.223 --> 40:05.904
This is about besting me.

40:05.905 --> 40:08.386
You're not here for your wife,
your family.

40:08.387 --> 40:10.028
You don't give a shit about any of them.

40:10.029 --> 40:12.190
Fuck you, Paz!
Fuck you, Charlie!

40:12.191 --> 40:15.153
Fuck you! You're too afraid
to take help from me...

40:15.154 --> 40:16.234
I'm afraid.
...from your doctor,

40:16.235 --> 40:17.916
from your wife, from anyone.

40:17.917 --> 40:19.838
When are you gonna stop
being a little shit...

40:21.240 --> 40:23.241
and realize that
you can't do this alone?

40:23.242 --> 40:25.764
Can or can't,
it doesn't really matter, Paz,

40:25.765 --> 40:27.686
'cause it's none
of your fucking business.

40:27.687 --> 40:30.609
It is my business because
they're my family now,

40:30.610 --> 40:34.172
and I'm not gonna stand by
and watch you sabotage

40:34.173 --> 40:36.414
the only people in your life
that love you.

40:36.415 --> 40:39.017
Sabotage? I would never do that.

40:39.018 --> 40:44.422
More bullshit! Tell me why.
Why do you want to fail?

40:44.423 --> 40:47.586
I work my ass off.
Why do you want to fail?!

40:47.587 --> 40:51.189
I don't, you son of a bitch!
Why do you want to fail?!

40:51.190 --> 40:52.992
He knows why.

40:55.755 --> 40:57.195
What is this?

40:57.196 --> 40:59.958
Is this some kind of intervention?

40:59.959 --> 41:01.960
Let's just get the fuck out of here.

41:11.050 --> 41:13.288
Why do you want to fail?

41:14.293 --> 41:16.015
I don't know.
Why don't you ask your friend...

41:21.941 --> 41:24.103
He says you're afraid.

41:28.668 --> 41:33.712
You gave the money back, Charlie. Twice.

41:33.713 --> 41:38.598
You're afraid that if I have enough,
I'd leave you.

41:41.761 --> 41:44.203
Help me.

41:54.493 --> 41:57.376
Damn it, Charlie. Hurry the fuck up.

42:00.660 --> 42:02.822
I want to feel your teeth on my skin.

42:09.068 --> 42:10.629
This is sick.

42:10.630 --> 42:12.711
Don't pretend you didn't want
to sneak a peek

42:12.712 --> 42:14.873
when you were scrubbing my body.

42:14.874 --> 42:19.117
You couldn't help yourself.
I'm everything you're not.

42:19.118 --> 42:20.358
Yeah, you're dead.

42:20.359 --> 42:22.360
I was man enough to keep the money.

42:22.361 --> 42:25.483
And it got you killed.
Oh, I forgot.

42:25.484 --> 42:29.327
You're the smart one.
Not just the coward.

42:29.328 --> 42:31.532
The failure.

42:33.172 --> 42:36.935
I'm not afraid of you.
Then you're crazy.

42:36.936 --> 42:39.458
'Cause I'm never going away.

42:58.958 --> 43:01.439
Jun-Bi!

43:45.805 --> 43:47.358
Charlie.

43:49.168 --> 43:54.012
I wanted to apologize
if my technique was too intense.

43:54.013 --> 43:56.014
I always like a deep-tissue massage

43:56.015 --> 43:57.776
as part of my spa experience.

43:59.819 --> 44:02.460
Well, I knew you could take it.

44:02.461 --> 44:04.041
You're strong.

44:05.144 --> 44:08.421
That's why I think you can
challenge yourself even more.

44:09.468 --> 44:11.269
But you're on the right path.

44:11.270 --> 44:14.135
Because you said the right
thing and put me there?

44:14.834 --> 44:16.095
Who knows?

44:17.637 --> 44:21.934
But I do know that
you coming into my life

44:23.122 --> 44:25.605
has altered my path.

44:28.407 --> 44:30.088
Thank you.

44:30.089 --> 44:32.612
For sharing your light and your dark.

44:33.573 --> 44:34.864
Anytime.

44:45.544 --> 44:47.105
I don't want to fight.

44:47.106 --> 44:49.749
I just want to collect my things
and be on my way.

44:52.391 --> 44:54.833
Exit survey.
I'm good.

44:54.834 --> 44:57.956
Oh, but we just want to know
how much you enjoyed your stay.

44:57.957 --> 44:59.517
You say "we." I can't figure it out.

44:59.518 --> 45:02.400
Are you his assistant or his boss?

45:02.401 --> 45:04.522
Why? Do you want to lodge a complaint?

45:04.523 --> 45:06.044
Is it about the food?

45:06.045 --> 45:08.086
Because there is a box
for that on this form.

45:08.087 --> 45:10.328
The food is terrible.
It is healthy.

45:10.329 --> 45:13.611
Maybe you're just not accustomed
to making good choices.

45:15.054 --> 45:18.256
Have we met before?
It is all over your face.

45:18.257 --> 45:21.219
You want so desperately
for me to believe

45:21.220 --> 45:25.463
that you are a rogue-ish cad,
a charming scoundrel.

45:25.464 --> 45:27.546
What am I, really?

45:30.069 --> 45:33.431
You are whatever your clients
need you to be.

45:33.432 --> 45:35.393
And what do you need me to be?

45:35.394 --> 45:38.156
On your way, as soon as possible.

45:38.157 --> 45:40.847
We finally agree.

45:42.321 --> 45:44.563
You and Linda, you are welcome here.

45:44.564 --> 45:46.084
Anytime.

45:46.085 --> 45:49.407
For the requisite 3 grand?
$2,875.

45:49.408 --> 45:51.289
Yeah, I think she'll want to pay it.

45:51.290 --> 45:52.891
Of course she would.

45:52.892 --> 45:55.694
Paz can give her
something that you won't.

45:55.695 --> 45:57.321
Or can't.

45:59.418 --> 46:05.184
Oh you are trying so
hard not to ask me what that is.

46:07.306 --> 46:09.948
You're only half as clever as you think.

46:09.949 --> 46:12.631
Twice as clever as I need to be.

46:12.632 --> 46:14.193
I'll be seeing you.

46:22.762 --> 46:24.362
I looked for you at the brunch.

46:24.363 --> 46:27.766
They had a mountain
of that fake bacon you love.

46:27.767 --> 46:29.728
I'm not a big fan of buffets.

46:29.729 --> 46:31.730
Oh, I thought you were
practically raised in one.

46:31.731 --> 46:33.858
Yeah, thanks, Ma.

46:34.774 --> 46:36.068
Hey, honey.

46:36.976 --> 46:39.322
I want you to know,
I'm really glad you came.

46:40.459 --> 46:41.532
I am.

46:42.261 --> 46:44.452
Helped me work through some of my shit.

46:44.904 --> 46:46.224
I'm glad, too.

46:46.225 --> 46:48.106
I got to slumber party with Marty.

46:48.107 --> 46:51.149
Breakdancing at dawn

46:51.150 --> 46:53.632
and manhandled by a half-naked guru.

46:53.633 --> 46:55.513
I mean, that's my kind of weekend.

46:55.514 --> 46:58.424
Okay, okay.
I am glad.

46:59.518 --> 47:01.280
I'm glad my Linda's back.

47:06.686 --> 47:09.487
Your Linda needs a good night's sleep.

47:09.488 --> 47:11.970
My cot was murder.
See? The truth comes out.

47:14.493 --> 47:16.791
Shall we head back? Home?

47:17.617 --> 47:19.028
I'll see you there.

47:22.942 --> 47:24.703
That was the plan, right?

47:24.704 --> 47:27.025
You were gonna go home after this?

47:27.662 --> 47:29.038
Of course.

47:30.498 --> 47:31.950
Hey, we should do this again.

47:31.951 --> 47:34.272
Uh, Paz's keeper... what's her name?

47:34.273 --> 47:35.634
Maggie.

47:35.635 --> 47:38.276
Yeah.
Maggie said we were invited anytime.

47:38.277 --> 47:41.640
For 3 grand.
Yeah, $2,875.

47:54.934 --> 47:57.736
When's Mom getting back?
Soon.

47:57.737 --> 47:59.537
What'd she say on the phone?

47:59.538 --> 48:01.700
She told us to meet her here,
and that's what we're doing.

48:01.701 --> 48:03.381
I don't like taxis.

48:03.382 --> 48:04.863
I'm sure they don't like you, either.

48:07.667 --> 48:09.067
Hi, Mom.

48:11.190 --> 48:12.712
Charlie.

48:21.520 --> 48:23.602
You little shit.

48:23.603 --> 48:26.124
The knot came undone in the
middle of my first flight.

48:26.125 --> 48:27.886
Oh, no.
"Oh, no"? You think?

48:27.887 --> 48:29.407
It's a fucking disaster.

48:29.408 --> 48:31.489
Shit. I left my cigarettes on the table.

48:31.490 --> 48:32.893
I'm sorry.

48:33.693 --> 48:35.574
Did you do it on purpose?

48:35.575 --> 48:38.857
What? No.

48:38.858 --> 48:40.538
You tied the wrong knot on purpose.

48:40.539 --> 48:42.028
No, I swear.

48:43.863 --> 48:47.065
Oh, Jesus, Charlie.
Okay, um, you know what?

48:47.066 --> 48:48.587
Just go out and entertain your sister.

48:48.588 --> 48:50.548
She's probably smoking
all my cigarettes by now.

48:50.549 --> 48:51.990
Okay.
Go.

48:51.991 --> 48:53.992
I don't want her
to think anything is wrong!

49:06.485 --> 49:08.447
Hey.

49:15.494 --> 49:18.136
Police! Get on the ground! Now!

49:18.137 --> 49:22.140
What'd she do?

49:22.141 --> 49:23.823
Put your hands behind your head.

49:31.751 --> 49:33.351
Okay, get up.

49:35.755 --> 49:37.315
It's okay, Charlie.
