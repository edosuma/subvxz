00:45.200 --> 00:46.901
Hey!

00:46.934 --> 00:48.901
I need help here.

00:50.864 --> 00:52.167
Thanks for nothing!

00:58.234 --> 01:00.501
Hey.

01:00.534 --> 01:01.501
Hey.

01:01.534 --> 01:02.868
Hey, buddy!

01:02.901 --> 01:05.367
Yeah, you.

01:10.234 --> 01:12.067
I'm a little surprised
you can see me.

01:12.100 --> 01:13.567
I got two eyes, don't I?

01:13.601 --> 01:15.000
Y-You got
a cell phone on you?

01:15.033 --> 01:17.801
Why?
'Cause I-I think I need
to, to call the cops.

01:17.834 --> 01:19.567
The cops? What are
you talking about?

01:19.601 --> 01:22.601
My wife just tried to kill me.

01:22.634 --> 01:24.501
Really?

01:24.534 --> 01:27.734
I was sitting in the den,
watching the end of the game.

01:27.767 --> 01:29.901
She was in the kitchen
doing dishes.

01:29.934 --> 01:32.467
Out of nowhere, she calls out
and wants to know

01:32.501 --> 01:35.267
i-if I got my beer
on a coaster.

01:35.300 --> 01:36.868
So I says, "No.

01:36.901 --> 01:39.334
No, I don't have my beer
on a coaster."

01:39.367 --> 01:41.901
So she yells back,
"How many times, Vincent?

01:41.934 --> 01:44.834
How many times have I told you
about the coaster?"

01:44.868 --> 01:46.601
So I says, "I don't know.

01:46.634 --> 01:48.033
"How many times
have I asked you

01:48.067 --> 01:49.767
to stop being ugly?"

01:49.801 --> 01:52.601
And then,
I didn't hear anything,

01:52.634 --> 01:55.501
but, like, a second later,

01:55.534 --> 01:57.567
she comes flying
out of the kitchen.

01:57.601 --> 01:59.367
She-She's got a carving knife
in her hand,

01:59.400 --> 02:02.100
and she's got this look
in her eyes.

02:02.133 --> 02:04.100
Next thing I know,
she's on top of me

02:04.133 --> 02:05.968
and I, I got my hands
around her wrist,

02:06.000 --> 02:10.133
and her ugly face is
right up against mine.

02:10.167 --> 02:14.467
Somehow, I push her off
a-and, and I start running,

02:14.501 --> 02:16.834
out the door, down the block.

02:16.868 --> 02:19.934
I-I-I ran all the way
to the boulevard here.

02:19.968 --> 02:22.901
I mean, this is the first
I've stopped.

02:22.934 --> 02:25.400
Look at me, look at me.

02:25.434 --> 02:26.981
I'm shaking.

02:31.192 --> 02:31.801
What?

02:31.834 --> 02:34.934
I'm sorry, it's just
I... I think I get it.

02:34.968 --> 02:37.868
The reason why you can see me,
the reason why you can hear me.

02:39.942 --> 02:40.968
You're dead.

02:43.342 --> 02:44.501
I beg your pardon?

02:45.340 --> 02:49.400
Your wife...
she got you with the knife.

02:49.434 --> 02:51.767
I'm guessing she was
on top of you?

02:51.801 --> 02:53.067
She got you.

02:53.100 --> 02:54.400
Th-The running,

02:54.434 --> 02:56.734
the boulevard,
that was all after.

02:56.767 --> 02:58.567
You're nuts.

02:58.601 --> 03:00.534
Quite possibly, but I'm,
I'm right about this.

03:00.567 --> 03:02.300
You're dead, I'm dead.

03:02.334 --> 03:03.767
We're dead.

03:04.868 --> 03:06.801
You're dead?

03:06.834 --> 03:08.901
I'm dead?

03:08.934 --> 03:10.167
Thanks, anyway.

03:10.200 --> 03:11.667
I'll get a phone
somewhere else.

03:11.701 --> 03:12.901
I-I got mugged.

03:12.934 --> 03:15.400
Right here in
this alley.

03:15.434 --> 03:17.067
Uh, guy was
high as a kite.

03:17.100 --> 03:18.701
He pulled a gun.

03:18.734 --> 03:20.601
Here, come on,
let me show you.

03:27.434 --> 03:28.334
Look.

03:32.100 --> 03:34.400
Ooh.
You all right?

03:34.434 --> 03:37.634
I just had
the oddest dream.

03:37.667 --> 03:40.601
I'm going to assume you said
that with a straight face.

03:40.634 --> 03:42.033
Where you going?

03:42.067 --> 03:44.501
I'm going to call
the authorities.

03:44.534 --> 03:46.100
Come on.

03:46.133 --> 03:47.300
It's Saturday night.

03:47.334 --> 03:49.767
You already worked a pretty
long and sleepless week.

03:49.801 --> 03:51.801
Don't you think
this'll keep till morning?

03:54.534 --> 03:56.434
I'm gonna take that as a no.

03:56.467 --> 04:04.434

Sync:FRM@Stiffler

04:52.067 --> 04:54.399
Mm, beat me to
the paper again,

04:54.400 --> 04:55.600
huh, you little newshound?

04:55.634 --> 04:57.034
It's the only
day of the week

04:57.067 --> 04:59.367
when they let the
comics be in color.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.634
You don't mind if I read
the Op-Ed section before you,

05:01.667 --> 05:03.500
do you?

05:03.534 --> 05:05.001
Where's Mommy?

05:05.034 --> 05:07.467
She had to
go into work.

05:07.500 --> 05:09.101
On a Sunday?

05:09.134 --> 05:13.600
Apparently, crime does not
work a five-day week.

05:13.634 --> 05:15.700
Will she be
coming back soon?

05:15.734 --> 05:16.934
Uh, I don't know.

05:16.967 --> 05:18.268
But she said

05:18.333 --> 05:21.333
she was gonna help me
with my diorama this afternoon.

05:21.367 --> 05:23.268
Relax, Bridge, relax.

05:23.300 --> 05:26.867
No diorama drama, okay?

05:26.901 --> 05:29.168
I'm happy to fill in for Mommy.

05:29.201 --> 05:30.201
There was an ATM

05:30.234 --> 05:31.367
right around
the corner.

05:31.400 --> 05:32.801
He had a receipt
in his pocket.

05:32.834 --> 05:35.967
Apparently, he'd just
withdrawn $500.

05:36.001 --> 05:37.700
Whoever it was took
the cash, his watch,

05:37.734 --> 05:40.101
left everything else.

05:40.134 --> 05:42.467
Driver's license says
his name is Morgan Turley.

05:42.500 --> 05:45.268
Has his family
been notified?

05:45.300 --> 05:48.367
So far, we haven't been able
to locate any.

05:48.400 --> 05:49.834
What about his friends?

05:49.867 --> 05:51.500
Most of the numbers
in his cell phone

05:51.534 --> 05:52.767
were for take-out places.

05:52.801 --> 05:55.400
We're still running
everything down.

05:55.433 --> 05:56.967
Apparently,
he was self-employed.

05:57.001 --> 05:58.367
We found a businescard.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.234
Worked out of his apartment.

06:00.268 --> 06:02.333
I fear this is not
someone a whole lot

06:02.367 --> 06:04.700
of people are
going to miss.

06:21.867 --> 06:23.434
You okay?

06:27.434 --> 06:29.767
<i>That so doesn't look
like George Washington.</i>

06:29.801 --> 06:31.434
Does, too.

06:31.467 --> 06:33.934
Looks more like an old lady
in a funny hat to me.

06:33.968 --> 06:35.767
Tell her it's George
Washington, Dad.

06:35.801 --> 06:38.300
It is absolutely
George Washington.

06:38.334 --> 06:40.033
In fact,
I will stake my reputation

06:40.067 --> 06:42.067
as a diorama-maker
on it.

06:42.100 --> 06:44.934
However, you bring up an
interesting point, Ariel,

06:44.968 --> 06:46.133
one that many
young scholars

06:46.167 --> 06:48.567
like yourself
have pointed out.

06:48.601 --> 06:50.868
Apparently, any number
of our founding fathers,

06:50.901 --> 06:52.634
when viewed in
historical paintings,

06:52.667 --> 06:55.734
bear an uncanny resemblance
to old ladies in funny hats.

06:55.767 --> 06:58.667
Yeah, that's what
men wore back then.

06:58.701 --> 06:59.701
White wigs and
weird hats.

06:59.734 --> 07:01.100
It's not their fault

07:01.133 --> 07:02.868
that's what grandmas
dress likethesedays.

07:02.901 --> 07:05.267
Bridge, I'm sorry,

07:05.300 --> 07:08.033
but grandmas don't even dress
likethatanymore.

07:09.767 --> 07:11.300
I'm Morgan,
by the way.

07:11.334 --> 07:13.100
Morgan Turley.

07:16.734 --> 07:19.801
No.

07:19.834 --> 07:22.000
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

07:22.033 --> 07:23.334
This is
really nuts.

07:23.367 --> 07:24.767
No, i-it's not nuts.

07:24.801 --> 07:28.467
It's, it's just the way
that it works.

07:28.501 --> 07:30.033
It's me.

07:30.067 --> 07:32.601
I've just passed on,
just like you have.

07:32.634 --> 07:36.934
I-I, I know it sounds crazy,
but once you accept it,

07:36.968 --> 07:41.033
once you embrace it,
it actually feels pretty good.

07:43.934 --> 07:45.300
Come on.

07:45.334 --> 07:47.868
Let me show you something.

07:54.434 --> 07:57.200
*

08:02.567 --> 08:04.400
I know it's hard to look at.

08:04.434 --> 08:05.667
I know it's hard to accept,

08:05.701 --> 08:08.067
but... you can't spend
the rest of forever

08:08.100 --> 08:10.400
running through the streets
in your underwear.

08:30.501 --> 08:33.000
Doesn't really look
like a millionaire, does she?

08:33.033 --> 08:34.501
Is she?

08:34.534 --> 08:35.534
Well, she
will be soon.

08:35.567 --> 08:37.067
That's Cadence Bixby.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.534
She's Morgan Turley's
sole heir.

08:39.567 --> 08:41.433
Washea millionaire?
No,

08:41.467 --> 08:44.033
but he had a life insurance
policy worth that much,

08:44.067 --> 08:45.367
and since she's
the only beneficiary,

08:45.400 --> 08:47.868
she wants to offer a reward
for any information

08:47.901 --> 08:49.367
leading to the capture
of his killer.

08:49.400 --> 08:50.367
Wow.

08:50.400 --> 08:51.501
Is she family?

08:51.534 --> 08:53.534
Actually,
she barely knew him.

08:53.567 --> 08:54.534
I don't get it.

08:54.567 --> 08:56.334
Well, apparently,
our boy Morgan

08:56.367 --> 08:57.334
really liked cats.

08:57.367 --> 08:58.567
Ms. Bixby

08:58.601 --> 09:01.033
over there was just
explaining in great detail

09:01.067 --> 09:03.167
how she rescues strays
in her free time.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.234
Brings dozens of the little
critters in off the streets,

09:05.267 --> 09:07.868
cleans them up,
tries to find them homes.

09:07.901 --> 09:09.634
Long story short,
Morgan adopted six of them

09:09.667 --> 09:12.200
from her
over the past two years.

09:12.234 --> 09:14.934
Anyway, her coffee's
getting cold.

09:14.968 --> 09:16.634
Well, wait a second.

09:16.667 --> 09:19.434
I wanted to ask you: has
that second body turned up yet?

09:19.467 --> 09:21.133
Mr. Underwear?

09:21.167 --> 09:22.567
No, but, uh, if
I hear anything,

09:22.601 --> 09:24.100
you'll be the
first to know.

09:24.133 --> 09:28.200
FYI, uh, I've been asked by
Ms. Bixby to spread the word

09:28.234 --> 09:29.801
there's going to be
a memorial service

09:29.834 --> 09:32.634
for Mr. Turley at Our Lady
of Sorrows tonight at 7:00.

09:32.667 --> 09:35.300
I hear all the coolest cats and
kittens are going to be there,

09:35.334 --> 09:38.234
so if you're hoping to get a
good seat, I'd sashay in early.

09:38.267 --> 09:39.400
Mm...

09:39.434 --> 09:40.467
Okay, explain it

09:40.501 --> 09:42.000
to me one more time
why you're going

09:42.033 --> 09:44.300
to a memorial service for a man
that you didn't even know.

09:44.334 --> 09:46.400
Because he has no one.

09:46.434 --> 09:49.234
He's leaving all his money
to a perfect stranger,

09:49.267 --> 09:50.801
for goodness' sake.

09:50.834 --> 09:53.934
And that's your
problem because...?

09:53.968 --> 09:56.334
Well, he's not leaving
the money to you, is he?

09:56.367 --> 09:59.033
Look, I've been dreaming
about this man for, what,

09:59.067 --> 10:00.234
two days now?

10:00.267 --> 10:02.300
Presumably,
there's a reason.

10:02.334 --> 10:04.634
Maybe it's to help figure out
who did this to him.

10:04.667 --> 10:06.701
Or maybe it's to be there
when the few people

10:06.734 --> 10:08.133
that he encountered
in his life

10:08.167 --> 10:10.200
gather together
to say good-bye.

10:10.234 --> 10:11.567
I'm not smart enough
to know.

10:11.601 --> 10:13.968
But I have been doing this
long enough to know

10:14.000 --> 10:15.234
that something
about this man--

10:15.267 --> 10:18.167
his or his death,
maybe-- matters.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.601
Yeah, it's just that yesterday
you weren't home.

10:20.634 --> 10:21.634
Tonight, you're going out.

10:21.667 --> 10:23.100
Which reminds me.

10:23.133 --> 10:25.000
I saw Bridgette's diorama
in the kitchen.

10:25.033 --> 10:26.501
Who's the old lady
in the boat?

10:26.534 --> 10:28.167
You don't get to do that.

10:28.200 --> 10:30.300
What? Did I say something wrong?

10:30.334 --> 10:32.400
If you're not here,
you don't get to critique.

10:32.434 --> 10:33.501
(laughs)
Har-dee-har-har.

10:33.534 --> 10:34.934
It wasn't an old
lady in the boat?

10:34.968 --> 10:35.968
That's George Washington,

10:36.000 --> 10:37.033
the father of our country,

10:37.067 --> 10:38.701
and if you don't like
the way he looks,

10:38.734 --> 10:40.033
I'm sorry.
then you should stay home

10:40.067 --> 10:41.701
the next time your daughter
has a project.

10:41.734 --> 10:42.968
Okay, I'm sorry,
I didn't know.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.534
They all looked like that
back then.

10:44.567 --> 10:46.801
Joe, I'm sorry.

10:46.834 --> 10:47.968
I'd like to thank

10:48.000 --> 10:51.934
Pastor Grimes again
for his lovely eulogy.

10:51.968 --> 10:54.767
And for allowing me to get up
here and say a few words

10:54.801 --> 10:56.667
about my good friend, Morgan.

10:56.701 --> 10:59.267
Morgan was a quiet man,

10:59.300 --> 11:01.534
a shy man.

11:01.567 --> 11:06.567
Deep down, I guess...
a lonely man.

11:07.601 --> 11:11.067
He kept mostly
to himself.

11:11.100 --> 11:14.167
It took time to get
to know Morgan.

11:14.200 --> 11:16.801
It took effort.

11:16.834 --> 11:22.801
We grew up together,
so I had an advantage.

11:22.834 --> 11:24.901
We knew each
other's secrets.

11:24.934 --> 11:28.767
And one of Morgan's
biggest secrets

11:28.801 --> 11:31.501
was that he was happiest
by himself.

11:31.534 --> 11:35.767
Happiest in his apartment.

11:35.801 --> 11:38.801
Once or twice a month, I
could usually drag him out

11:38.834 --> 11:41.334
to a movie or
a ball game.

11:41.367 --> 11:44.067
But that was it
for him.

11:44.100 --> 11:46.968
Pleasure in
small doses.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.300
That was all
he could handle.

11:50.334 --> 11:52.300
I'm gonna miss him.

11:53.834 --> 11:57.901
The talks after we would
leave the theater.

11:59.334 --> 12:01.534
Or just sitting
in his apartment,

12:01.567 --> 12:04.701
staring out the window.

12:04.734 --> 12:07.100
His favorite way to deal
with the world.

12:08.859 --> 12:10.432
Good-bye Morgan.

12:10.532 --> 12:12.299
You were a good man

12:12.333 --> 12:14.799
and a great friend.

12:14.832 --> 12:17.164
Mr. Turley?

12:19.789 --> 12:22.589
I'm glad you were
able to see this.

12:22.623 --> 12:24.290
I'm glad that you
were able to see

12:24.323 --> 12:25.890
that people really do care.

12:30.689 --> 12:33.489
You can see me?

12:33.522 --> 12:34.990
You know that I'm here?

12:36.990 --> 12:38.422
This is weird.

12:38.456 --> 12:39.823
You don't look dead.

12:39.856 --> 12:41.090
I'm not.

12:41.123 --> 12:42.856
It's a long story.

12:42.890 --> 12:45.756
But don't worry;
I'm the only one.

12:45.789 --> 12:48.357
Actually, I'm with the
District Attorney's office.

12:48.389 --> 12:50.190
And I want to take
this opportunity

12:50.223 --> 12:52.990
to assure you we are
going to find the person

12:53.023 --> 12:54.357
who did this to you.

12:54.389 --> 12:57.689
We are going to punish the
person who did this to you.

12:59.756 --> 13:01.956
You know, it's okay
if you don't.

13:03.990 --> 13:06.156
Excuse me?

13:07.218 --> 13:10.075
I got to believe you've got
better things to do.

13:10.257 --> 13:14.090
I mean, you find the person
that did this to me,

13:14.123 --> 13:15.723
it's not going
to change anything.

13:15.756 --> 13:17.522
I'm still
going to be dead.

13:17.556 --> 13:20.190
You deserve justice,
Mr. Turley.

13:20.223 --> 13:21.823
And we certainly
don't want

13:21.856 --> 13:23.923
whoever did this to
you to do it again.

13:23.956 --> 13:25.257
Oh, I wouldn't worry
about that.

13:25.290 --> 13:26.456
I don't think he would.

13:28.090 --> 13:31.456
I got the distinct impression
that this was a one-time thing.

13:34.522 --> 13:39.623
Well, on the off-chance
that you're wrong,

13:39.656 --> 13:41.856
is there anything
you can tell me

13:41.890 --> 13:43.890
about this man?

13:49.026 --> 13:50.526
He rebuffed you?

13:50.527 --> 13:51.594
He rebuffed me.

13:51.627 --> 13:52.826
I looked down
for a second

13:52.859 --> 13:54.260
to get something
out of my purse,

13:54.293 --> 13:55.493
and he was gone.

13:55.527 --> 13:56.793
The nerve of some ghosts.

13:56.826 --> 13:58.793
He looked so threatened,

13:58.826 --> 14:01.360
like I was some kind
of problem or something.

14:02.187 --> 14:03.653
Well, who knows?

14:03.686 --> 14:04.786
Maybe he was embarrassed.

14:04.820 --> 14:06.187
Embarrassed by what?

14:06.220 --> 14:10.452
Well, the guy's at his
own memorial service.

14:10.486 --> 14:12.653
He's spying on his friends,

14:12.686 --> 14:15.120
listening to what they
had to say about him.

14:15.153 --> 14:17.452
It's a little narcissistic,
it's a little embarrassing

14:17.486 --> 14:18.686
if you get caught at it.

14:18.719 --> 14:20.553
I just wanted him to know
that I cared.

14:20.586 --> 14:21.786
I just want him
to know

14:21.820 --> 14:23.419
that whoever did this
to him

14:23.452 --> 14:25.220
wasn't simply going
to get away with it.

14:25.253 --> 14:26.719
All right, I
get that, I do,

14:26.753 --> 14:28.220
and I'm sure
that he does, too,

14:28.253 --> 14:29.853
so just be patient.

14:29.886 --> 14:31.287
If he really wants your help,

14:31.319 --> 14:34.053
I'm sure he'll
come asking for it.

14:34.086 --> 14:36.120
I certainly would
if I were dead.

14:38.719 --> 14:41.352
She really did it.

14:41.386 --> 14:42.920
I'm sorry.

14:42.953 --> 14:45.220
I just thought...

14:45.253 --> 14:47.108
you seemed like you really
needed to see the truth.

14:47.208 --> 14:49.386
It seemed like you were having
a hard time accepting.

14:49.419 --> 14:50.686
Oh.

14:50.719 --> 14:52.486
My grandfath's watch.

14:52.519 --> 14:54.519
Killing me wasn't enough.

14:54.553 --> 14:57.352
She had to make me
break that watch.

14:57.386 --> 14:59.287
This watch?

14:59.319 --> 15:01.886
This is a hundred-
year-old watch.

15:01.920 --> 15:04.753
My Grandpa DiScala,
he gave it to me

15:04.786 --> 15:07.519
on his deathbed.

15:08.986 --> 15:10.419
Let it go, Vincent.

15:10.452 --> 15:12.786
We don't need watches
where we're going.

15:15.053 --> 15:16.287
Why, Gladys?!

15:22.352 --> 15:25.287
All right, I know
you hated me,

15:25.319 --> 15:27.187
but I never knew you
hated me this much.

15:35.853 --> 15:38.220
You know...

15:38.253 --> 15:40.086
for a fellow
murder victim,

15:40.120 --> 15:43.053
you're being pretty Zen
about all this.

15:44.086 --> 15:45.519
I'm dead.

15:45.553 --> 15:46.786
Why shouldn't I be Zen?

15:46.820 --> 15:48.086
Aren't you ticked?

15:48.120 --> 15:49.820
Don't you want to get
the guy who killed you?

15:49.853 --> 15:52.953
I'm beyond all that now;
you should be, too.

15:58.153 --> 16:00.220
What happened to you, anyway?

16:00.253 --> 16:01.352
Mugging, huh?

16:01.386 --> 16:06.586
Well... um, not exactly.

16:06.619 --> 16:08.686
What do you mean,
"not exactly"?

16:08.719 --> 16:10.719
How'd you end up getting
shot in that alley?

16:10.753 --> 16:13.786
I... it's kind of a...

16:13.820 --> 16:16.653
a long story actually.

16:16.686 --> 16:19.220
Look at me, friend.

16:19.253 --> 16:22.086
I got nothing but time, right?

16:22.120 --> 16:23.352
You know what?

16:23.386 --> 16:25.686
I'd rather show you
than tell you.

16:25.719 --> 16:27.586
We have to go
somewhere else now?

16:27.619 --> 16:29.786
My apartment, yeah.

16:37.419 --> 16:39.020
Uh, seriously,
Vincent...

16:39.053 --> 16:41.020
I'm not sure
that you want to see this.

16:47.653 --> 16:50.786
Oh... all
right, fine.

16:50.820 --> 16:52.820
Your apartment, it is.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.619
Vincent and Gladys DiScala.

17:01.653 --> 17:03.187
Got it.

17:03.220 --> 17:04.752
Anything else?

17:04.786 --> 17:07.586
She cut him up with a saw;
that's why we can't find him.

17:07.618 --> 17:09.119
No way to get a warrant,

17:09.153 --> 17:11.386
but once I have an address,
I could certainly swing by

17:11.419 --> 17:13.419
and ask a few questions
about her husband's whereabouts.

17:13.452 --> 17:14.786
You want to come with?

17:14.819 --> 17:16.119
Can't.

17:16.153 --> 17:17.586
I'm on my way
to Morgan Turley's apartment.

17:17.618 --> 17:18.920
What for?

17:18.953 --> 17:21.386
Well, in that same dream,
Morgan started to suggest

17:21.419 --> 17:24.119
that maybe there was more
to it than just a mugging.

17:24.153 --> 17:27.586
And then he said
he'd rather show Vincent

17:27.618 --> 17:29.686
why he was killed than tell him.

17:29.719 --> 17:32.419
He made it sound like the answer
was somewhere in his apartment.

17:32.452 --> 17:33.820
I just...

17:33.853 --> 17:35.319
I just want to take a look.

18:01.653 --> 18:04.486
Hey, kitty, kitty.

18:04.519 --> 18:07.719
Oh, kitty.

18:19.586 --> 18:22.786
Can I help you
with something?

18:22.820 --> 18:24.953
Hello again.

18:24.986 --> 18:26.287
Hello.

18:26.452 --> 18:28.753
Is there something
I can help you with?

18:28.786 --> 18:31.753
I was just looking
at this chair.

18:31.786 --> 18:34.320
I was wondering why it was
pointing towards the window.

18:34.353 --> 18:36.486
I like looking
out the window.

18:36.519 --> 18:38.020
I've always liked
looking out the window,

18:38.053 --> 18:39.619
ever since
I was a little boy.

18:39.653 --> 18:41.486
Anything else?

18:41.519 --> 18:43.552
No, I...

18:43.586 --> 18:45.686
Do you want me to call someone
about your cats?

18:45.719 --> 18:47.486
Maybe that wom you left
the money to?

18:47.519 --> 18:50.853
I'm sure you want them
to find good homes.

18:50.886 --> 18:52.519
No, don't call her.

18:52.552 --> 18:54.953
I don't want her to see
where I lived.

18:54.986 --> 18:57.653
Somebody else,
call somebody else.

19:00.086 --> 19:02.287
What? Why are you looking
at me like that?

19:02.320 --> 19:03.653
I don't know.

19:03.686 --> 19:06.719
I asked you if you could tell me
anything about your killer

19:06.753 --> 19:08.686
the other day,
and you just disappeared.

19:08.719 --> 19:10.053
I apologize.

19:10.086 --> 19:13.953
I... I was confused.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.053
You are alive
but you could see me.

19:16.086 --> 19:18.387
I didn't understand
about people like you.

19:18.419 --> 19:20.853
I'm sorry if I frightened you.

19:20.886 --> 19:24.152
It's okay.

19:24.153 --> 19:26.220
You look nervous.

19:26.253 --> 19:28.519
I'm not nervous.

19:30.400 --> 19:31.719
It's awfully dark in here.

19:31.753 --> 19:34.786
You afraid someone's
going to see you?

19:41.053 --> 19:43.686
Hey, wait a second,
isn't that her?

19:43.719 --> 19:46.253
Isn't that the woman
we were just talking about,

19:46.287 --> 19:47.886
the one you left
all that money to?

19:47.920 --> 19:51.220
The one who said
that she barely knew you?

19:51.253 --> 19:53.686
Cadence... something?

19:54.517 --> 19:57.230
???

20:04.900 --> 20:07.833
??? ne tonight
as police continue to find

20:07.866 --> 20:09.866
small pieces
of Glendale resident

20:09.900 --> 20:12.400
Vincent DiScala buried
throughout the backyard

20:12.434 --> 20:13.767
of his home.

20:13.801 --> 20:16.434
His wife, Gladys DiScala,
is being taken into custody,

20:16.467 --> 20:18.434
but so far police refuse

20:18.467 --> 20:20.367
to discuss the specifics
of the evidence

20:20.400 --> 20:22.300
against her at this time.

20:24.100 --> 20:26.734
I don't quite know how
I'm going to break this

20:26.767 --> 20:28.367
to poor Bridge.

20:28.400 --> 20:30.467
I don't think we
have enough magnets

20:30.500 --> 20:33.133
to stick this "A+" diorama

20:33.167 --> 20:34.866
depicting the father
of our country

20:34.900 --> 20:36.900
to the refrigerator.

20:40.866 --> 20:42.033
Hmm.

20:44.434 --> 20:46.500
Did I mention the "A+"?

20:46.534 --> 20:48.133
I just don't get it.

20:48.167 --> 20:50.667
Why wouldn't he want to tell me
who did this to him?

20:50.701 --> 20:52.167
Give me a description?

20:52.200 --> 20:54.233
Tell me what really happened?

20:54.267 --> 20:56.767
Because he doesn't
want you to know.

20:57.866 --> 20:59.567
But why?

20:59.600 --> 21:00.933
Why would a person
in their right mind

21:00.966 --> 21:02.833
not want their
killer found?

21:02.866 --> 21:04.567
Don't you find
it mystifying?

21:04.600 --> 21:06.334
Uh, no. What I
find mystifying

21:06.367 --> 21:08.500
is your insistence
on helping this man,

21:08.534 --> 21:10.400
despite the fact that
he doesn't want it.

21:11.467 --> 21:13.233
He's dead.

21:13.267 --> 21:15.167
Let him lie in peace.

21:15.200 --> 21:16.767
For that matr,

21:16.801 --> 21:20.300
how about the two
of us lying in peace?

21:20.334 --> 21:22.701
That makes no sense,
that's crazy.

21:22.734 --> 21:25.367
Why protect the person
who ended your life?

21:25.400 --> 21:26.534
That's crazy?

21:26.567 --> 21:28.966
How about leaving
everything you have

21:29.000 --> 21:31.634
to a woman that
you barely knew?

21:31.667 --> 21:34.634
A woman you say this
guy peeped on every day?

21:34.667 --> 21:36.966
Consider the
source, Allison.

21:38.500 --> 21:40.667
Yeah, well...

21:46.167 --> 21:48.033
I love you, too.

21:49.500 --> 21:51.667
What's the deal with the cats?

21:51.701 --> 21:53.400
What do you mean "What's
the deal with the cats"?

21:53.434 --> 21:54.767
They're cats.
Don't you like cats?

21:54.801 --> 21:56.334
Not really.

21:56.367 --> 21:58.167
But I guess you do, huh?

21:58.200 --> 21:59.833
I'm allergic, actually.

21:59.866 --> 22:02.167
What? Then how come
you got so many?

22:02.200 --> 22:04.634
I mean,hadso many.

22:04.667 --> 22:06.500
You ever been
in love, Vincent?

22:08.200 --> 22:10.334
I don't know.

22:10.367 --> 22:12.300
Given the events of
the past few days,

22:12.334 --> 22:14.167
and, uh, given
the circumstances

22:14.200 --> 22:16.000
of my present condition,

22:16.033 --> 22:17.900
I have to say I would like

22:17.933 --> 22:20.500
to think about that
before I answer. Why?

22:27.734 --> 22:29.701
Her?

22:31.100 --> 22:33.300
Looks like
she had a party.

22:33.334 --> 22:34.866
She's got a lot
to celebrate.

22:34.900 --> 22:37.634
She just came
into a lot of money.

22:37.667 --> 22:39.966
Good for her.
Yup.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.634
Left her everything I had.

22:42.667 --> 22:45.133
I don't get it.

22:45.167 --> 22:46.900
What's not to get?
Look at her.

22:46.933 --> 22:49.833
Okay, but she's alive,

22:49.866 --> 22:52.866
and you're kind
of indisposed.

22:55.966 --> 22:57.966
Are you trying to tell
me that she may have had

22:58.000 --> 22:59.734
something to do
with your...

22:59.767 --> 23:01.367
untimely passing?

23:02.866 --> 23:05.000
It wasn't untimely, Vincent.

23:05.033 --> 23:07.900
It was precisely timed.
It was perfectly timed.

23:08.966 --> 23:10.667
Wait a second.

23:10.701 --> 23:12.734
Are you trying
to tell me that she's
the one who shot you?

23:13.801 --> 23:15.167
You want to hear
the whole story?

23:15.200 --> 23:16.467
You want to hear all about it?

23:16.500 --> 23:18.067
Okay.

23:20.100 --> 23:21.833
Hang on a second.

23:21.866 --> 23:23.600
I think somebody else is here.

23:23.634 --> 23:25.634
Somebody is listening to us.

23:28.100 --> 23:29.600
It's you, isn't it?

23:29.634 --> 23:31.801
Nobody invited you here.

23:31.833 --> 23:33.300
Wake up!

23:33.334 --> 23:34.801
Did you hear me?

23:34.833 --> 23:37.133
I said "Wake up." Wake up!

23:37.167 --> 23:41.133
Get your head
out of my... death.

23:41.167 --> 23:44.300
You want me to give you
a bad dream?

23:44.334 --> 23:46.734
Okay. You asked for it.

23:59.667 --> 24:02.167
That is so not fair.

24:06.866 --> 24:08.966
Morgan Turley was in
love with the cat lady.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.200
Cadence Bixby?

24:11.233 --> 24:13.033
When I heard about
that million dollars

24:13.067 --> 24:14.667
he left her, I had a hunch
he might have been

24:14.701 --> 24:16.300
more hot than cold on her.

24:16.334 --> 24:18.233
I think he overplayed
his hand though.

24:18.267 --> 24:19.400
It's kind of tough
to close the deal

24:19.434 --> 24:20.767
from where he is,
don't you think?

24:20.801 --> 24:22.167
I think she may have
seduced him, talked him

24:22.200 --> 24:24.267
into getting that ridiculous
life insurance policy,

24:24.300 --> 24:25.767
and then killed him.

24:25.801 --> 24:27.267
Can we talk to her?

24:30.801 --> 24:32.434
Ms. Bixby?

24:32.467 --> 24:35.000
I'm District
Attorney Devalos.

24:35.033 --> 24:37.133
This is Allison Dubois.

24:37.167 --> 24:38.467
Of course, you
already know

24:38.500 --> 24:39.900
Detective Scanlon.
We very much

24:39.933 --> 24:41.667
appreciate you coming
down to speak with us.

24:41.701 --> 24:42.767
Now you've gone too far.

24:42.801 --> 24:44.933
This woman had nothing
to do with anything.

24:44.966 --> 24:46.267
Your assistant on the phone
said you wanted

24:46.300 --> 24:47.866
to talk to me about what
happened to poor Mr. Turley?

24:47.900 --> 24:50.833
Has someone come forward
with new information?

24:50.866 --> 24:53.467
Are they trying to claim
the reward money that I offered?

24:53.500 --> 24:56.033
Let's talk in the
conference room please.

24:59.167 --> 25:00.900
Do you want me
to give you bad dreams

25:00.933 --> 25:02.300
every night for the rest
of your life?

25:02.334 --> 25:04.467
And that would change
my life how, exactly?

25:04.500 --> 25:06.367
I'm begging you,
put a stop to this.

25:06.400 --> 25:07.866
No good can come of this.

25:07.900 --> 25:09.801
Tell me what really
happened in that alley.

25:09.866 --> 25:10.933
Who shot you?

25:10.966 --> 25:12.434
Why? Why do you care?

25:12.467 --> 25:13.667
You ever heard of the expression

25:13.701 --> 25:16.167
"die in peace"?

25:16.200 --> 25:18.100
Ms. Bixby, it's

25:18.133 --> 25:20.167
my understanding that when you
came to see Detective Scanlon

25:20.200 --> 25:23.334
the other day, you told him you
hardly knew Morgan Turley.

25:23.367 --> 25:26.033
That's true.
I run a small,

25:26.067 --> 25:27.500
non-profit
shelter for cats.

25:27.534 --> 25:31.033
I take in strays,
try to find them homes.

25:31.067 --> 25:33.267
One day, Mr. Turley just
walked through the door.

25:33.300 --> 25:36.067
Said he loved cats, was
wondering if he could adopt one.

25:36.100 --> 25:37.400
Is that a crime?

25:37.434 --> 25:39.334
And that's it?

25:39.367 --> 25:42.500
That's the extent
of your relationship?

25:42.534 --> 25:44.966
Well, it actually
happened a number of times.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.300
I believe he ultimately
ended up adopting

25:47.334 --> 25:48.534
about a half dozen strays.

25:48.567 --> 25:51.300
Sounds like a nice man.

25:51.334 --> 25:52.767
He seemed so.

25:52.801 --> 25:54.233
Ms. Bixby, didn't
you find it odd

25:54.267 --> 25:55.866
that someone you barely knew

25:55.900 --> 25:57.467
would leave you
so much money?

25:57.500 --> 25:58.866
Of course.

25:58.900 --> 26:00.467
It's been overwhelming.

26:00.500 --> 26:03.067
Morgan Turley has
changed my life.

26:03.100 --> 26:05.200
I can only guess
that the cats

26:05.233 --> 26:07.300
I placed with him
gave him great joy,

26:07.334 --> 26:09.634
that he was looking
for a way to say thank you,

26:09.667 --> 26:13.300
to support the work that made
those adoptions possible,

26:13.334 --> 26:17.100
But why leave that money
to you, specifically?

26:17.133 --> 26:19.334
He didn't leave
it to your shelter.

26:19.367 --> 26:21.600
He didn't leave it
to any of the bigger,

26:21.634 --> 26:24.067
better known organizations
that do similar work.

26:24.100 --> 26:25.567
What do you mean "why"?

26:25.600 --> 26:27.367
Because I trust her.

26:27.400 --> 26:28.933
Because it was my money.

26:28.966 --> 26:31.300
I could do whatever the hell
I wanted to with it.

26:31.334 --> 26:33.833
Oh, my goodness.

26:33.866 --> 26:35.701
You think that I
might have something

26:35.734 --> 26:37.100
to do with his murder,

26:37.133 --> 26:39.133
don't you?
No. No one's saying that.

26:39.167 --> 26:40.801
We're exploring all
sorts of possibilities,

26:40.833 --> 26:42.100
but it'd be helpful
if you could tell us

26:42.133 --> 26:44.000
where you were this
past Saturday night.

26:44.033 --> 26:47.500
Is there anyone
who can vouch for
your whereabouts?

26:47.534 --> 26:50.133
No.

26:50.167 --> 26:51.966
I was home.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.434
But I was by myself.

26:56.500 --> 26:57.734
Am I in trouble?

26:57.767 --> 26:59.067
Do I need a lawyer?

27:06.267 --> 27:08.534
I'm begging you--
look at her.

27:08.567 --> 27:10.167
Is that the face
of a killer?

27:10.200 --> 27:11.866
Is that the face of
a person who could

27:11.900 --> 27:13.767
pull the trigger on
another human being?

27:13.801 --> 27:16.300
She rescues pussycats
for God's sake!

27:16.334 --> 27:18.000
So you never
had any contact

27:18.033 --> 27:20.367
with Mr. Turley
outside of the shelter?

27:20.400 --> 27:22.133
You didn't know him
in any context

27:22.167 --> 27:25.933
except as a man who was
interested in adopting cats?

27:25.966 --> 27:27.900
When they first called
to tell me he had passed away

27:27.933 --> 27:30.167
and left me his
insurance money,

27:30.200 --> 27:31.767
I couldn't even
remember who he was.

27:31.801 --> 27:33.866
What did I tell you?
Come on, Mrs. Dubois.

27:33.900 --> 27:34.966
You can put a
stop to this.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.767
You can do it.

27:37.801 --> 27:40.133
Did you know you
were neighbors?
Oh, no.

27:40.167 --> 27:42.801
No, no, no.
Don't tell her that!
Really?

27:42.833 --> 27:45.367
I believe he lived directly
across the street from you.

27:45.400 --> 27:47.966
And who knows, maybe you can
see his apartment from yours?

27:48.000 --> 27:50.833
Wouldn't that be
an amazing coincidence.

27:50.866 --> 27:53.334
And maybe he could see

27:53.367 --> 27:56.167
your apartment from his.

27:56.200 --> 27:59.567
Oh.

27:59.600 --> 28:01.334
Okay. I give.

28:01.367 --> 28:03.033
I'll tell you anything
you want to know.

28:03.067 --> 28:04.567
Just don't tell
her anything else.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.534
Don't ask her
anything else.

28:06.567 --> 28:08.634
Isn't there any way
we can check on that?

28:08.667 --> 28:09.966
Excuse yourself.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.801
Right now. Let's go
out into the hallway,

28:11.833 --> 28:13.933
and I'll tell
you everything.
Perhaps.

28:13.966 --> 28:15.267
Can you excuse me a second?

28:15.300 --> 28:16.701
I need to step outside.

28:16.734 --> 28:18.833
I need to check on something.
I'll be right back.

28:22.167 --> 28:23.801
I did it.
You did what?

28:23.833 --> 28:24.900
I killed myself.

28:24.933 --> 28:26.067
You did not.

28:26.100 --> 28:27.233
Did, too.

28:27.267 --> 28:28.334
Cross my heart and hope to die.

28:28.367 --> 28:29.600
Ask anybody who knows me.

28:29.634 --> 28:31.334
I've always talked
about killing myself.

28:31.367 --> 28:33.767
That's not funny,
and that's not true.

28:33.801 --> 28:35.233
There's nothing
about your injuries

28:35.267 --> 28:36.767
that are consistent
with suicide.

28:36.801 --> 28:38.434
Besides, everyone knows,

28:38.467 --> 28:40.767
life insurance doesn't
pay off on suicides.

28:40.801 --> 28:42.833
If you prove it was a suicide.

28:42.866 --> 28:44.434
Which we can't because it isn't.

28:44.467 --> 28:46.000
Well, then...

28:46.033 --> 28:47.534
I guess we're at a standoff.

28:47.567 --> 28:50.267
Really? I was just
thinking of taking Cadence

28:50.300 --> 28:51.767
for a little tour of your place.

28:51.801 --> 28:53.701
Checking out the cats,
showing her

28:53.734 --> 28:55.434
your view from your
living room window.

28:55.467 --> 28:56.767
No!

28:56.801 --> 28:59.033
Yes!
Oh, no.

28:59.067 --> 29:02.100
Don't tell me you're
dragging him into this, too?

29:02.133 --> 29:04.000
I'm sorry to
bother you.

29:04.033 --> 29:05.300
Do you work here?

29:05.334 --> 29:06.933
Yes, I do.

29:06.966 --> 29:09.133
I'm looking for
my fianc, Cadence?

29:09.167 --> 29:10.400
Cadence Bixby?

29:10.434 --> 29:12.567
Your fianc?
Your fianc?

29:12.600 --> 29:13.966
Do you know where
she might be?

29:14.000 --> 29:16.267
She's right in there.

29:17.300 --> 29:19.300
Thanks.

29:21.000 --> 29:24.567
You never told me that
Cadence and Nick were...

29:28.878 --> 29:30.978
That's it, I'm done.

29:31.012 --> 29:32.878
The guy doesn't care
about catching his killer,

29:32.912 --> 29:34.945
why should I?

29:36.379 --> 29:38.745
It's just so strange.

29:38.778 --> 29:41.112
You'd think the way he
always kept an eye on her,

29:41.145 --> 29:43.878
he'd have a clue that she was
involved with his best friend.

29:43.912 --> 29:46.412
Do I feel sorry
for the guy? Absolutely.

29:46.446 --> 29:50.379
Am I gonna lose any more
sleep over him? No.

29:50.412 --> 29:52.212
Me, either.

29:56.179 --> 29:58.611
Okay.

29:58.645 --> 30:01.245
I'm ready.

30:01.279 --> 30:04.312
Pull the trigger.

30:04.345 --> 30:06.312
You sure about this?

30:14.978 --> 30:18.711
Don't back out on me, Nick.

30:18.745 --> 30:20.345
Please.

30:20.379 --> 30:22.312
I'm begging you.

30:25.245 --> 30:26.611
With friends

30:26.645 --> 30:28.112
like that, huh?

30:30.179 --> 30:32.745
I don't understand.

30:32.778 --> 30:34.845
Morgan wanted to die?

30:34.878 --> 30:36.745
That was before he knew
his best pal

30:36.778 --> 30:39.279
was shacking up
with the girl he loved.

30:39.312 --> 30:41.645
Now, I think he's having
second thoughts.

30:43.397 --> 30:46.045
Did you send me
that dream, Mr. DiScala?

30:46.079 --> 30:48.912
I know you've been
trying to help him.

30:48.945 --> 30:51.912
Considering the hit
the poor guy took today,

30:51.945 --> 30:54.212
I thought you ought
to know the truth.

31:15.279 --> 31:17.578
You okay?

31:17.611 --> 31:19.012
Vincent filled me in,

31:19.045 --> 31:21.045
showed me what really
happened in that alley.

31:30.279 --> 31:31.912
But why, Morgan?

31:31.945 --> 31:33.945
Why would you do that?

31:37.845 --> 31:39.745
I loved
Cadence Bixby.

31:39.778 --> 31:43.512
From the moment I laid eyes
on her, through this window,

31:43.546 --> 31:45.945
I loved Cadence Bixby.

31:45.978 --> 31:48.512
I watched her up
here for months--

31:48.546 --> 31:50.546
getting ready for
work in the morning,

31:50.578 --> 31:52.512
coming home from
work in the evening--

31:52.546 --> 31:53.878
and I thought
to myself,

31:53.912 --> 31:57.345
"My God, if I could just
get close to this woman,

31:57.379 --> 32:01.112
if I could just matter
to this woman."

32:01.145 --> 32:02.245
And then,

32:02.279 --> 32:04.546
I decided to
follow her.

32:04.578 --> 32:07.212
I wanted to know more than
what I saw from up here--

32:07.245 --> 32:10.379
where she worked,
where she ate.

32:10.412 --> 32:12.112
And then I discovered
the shelter.

32:12.145 --> 32:15.546
It took me weeks to get up
the courage to go in.

32:15.578 --> 32:17.145
And once I did,

32:17.179 --> 32:20.012
once I was actually
close to her,

32:20.045 --> 32:23.446
she was even more beautiful,
more special.

32:23.479 --> 32:27.512
And I never knew what to do,
and I never knew what to say.

32:27.546 --> 32:30.546
I just kept
adopting cats.

32:30.578 --> 32:33.079
It was the one
thing that worked.

32:33.112 --> 32:36.112
Whenever I did it, she'd
be mine for a half hour.

32:36.145 --> 32:40.412
Asong as it took to fill out
the paperwork, she'd be mi.

32:40.446 --> 32:41.912
But that still
doesn't explain...

32:41.945 --> 32:44.412
Doesn't it?

32:44.446 --> 32:46.611
I showed her to him--

32:46.645 --> 32:50.045
right here, a little
more than a year ago.

32:50.079 --> 32:54.212
I thought if he saw her, he
could understand why she was

32:54.245 --> 32:56.578
the only thing I
ever talked about.

32:56.611 --> 32:58.778
I guess he understood
more than I knew.

32:58.812 --> 33:02.045
I can't believe
he kept that from you,

33:02.079 --> 33:03.778
knowing what you were
planning to do.

33:03.812 --> 33:06.279
<i>But it was his
plan, Mrs. Dubois.</i>

33:06.312 --> 33:07.812
It was his idea.

33:07.845 --> 33:10.611
The million-dollar insurance
policy, the staged mugging--

33:10.645 --> 33:11.711
it was all his idea.

33:11.745 --> 33:12.945
He just talked
me into it.

33:12.978 --> 33:16.145
This doesn't make sense.

33:16.179 --> 33:19.878
How can anyone possibly talk you
into letting them kill you?

33:21.945 --> 33:25.179
I'd been threatening to do it
to myself for years.

33:25.212 --> 33:28.279
Suddenly, it all made sense.

33:28.312 --> 33:30.711
I could put myself
out of the pain I was in

33:30.745 --> 33:33.945
and give her
this remarkable gift.

33:33.978 --> 33:35.412
I would matter to her.

33:38.645 --> 33:40.412
And little did you know,

33:40.446 --> 33:42.645
all that money wouldn't
just be going to Cadence.

33:42.678 --> 33:45.611
It would eventually find
its way to her new husband,

33:45.645 --> 33:48.479
your best friend, Nick.

33:48.512 --> 33:52.446
I'm really depressed.

33:52.479 --> 33:55.912
I haven't felt
this suicidal since...

33:55.945 --> 33:58.079
since I was alive.

33:58.112 --> 34:02.479
Well, maybe there's something
we can do about that.

34:08.264 --> 34:09.563
Where is she?

34:09.598 --> 34:12.030
Ms. Bixby is waiting for you
in the conference room.

34:12.063 --> 34:13.598
I believe you know the way.

34:27.264 --> 34:30.031
Cade...

34:30.063 --> 34:31.264
I don't know
what these people

34:31.297 --> 34:32.496
have been filling
your head with,

34:32.530 --> 34:36.630
but I'm here to tell you
it's not true.

34:36.664 --> 34:38.730
I called a lawyer;
he's on his way.

34:38.764 --> 34:41.197
But I don't
understand.

34:41.231 --> 34:44.063
Why would you
do that, Nick?

34:44.097 --> 34:46.630
If everything they
told me wasn't true,

34:46.664 --> 34:48.197
why would you even
need a lawyer?

34:48.231 --> 34:50.530
Come on.

34:50.563 --> 34:51.697
Let's talk about this outside.

34:51.730 --> 34:53.197
What's wrong
with right here?

34:53.231 --> 34:56.797
We don't have
anything to hide.

34:56.830 --> 34:58.231
Do we?

34:58.264 --> 35:00.298
Cadence was just telling us
how odd she found it

35:00.331 --> 35:02.164
that it wasn't until
Morgan passed away

35:02.197 --> 35:04.463
that you even mentioned
that he was your friend.

35:05.387 --> 35:07.596
Darling...

35:07.597 --> 35:09.263
I explained that already.

35:09.296 --> 35:11.730
He and I weren't
getting along.

35:11.763 --> 35:13.697
We weren't speaking,
that's all.

35:13.730 --> 35:14.697
I loved him,

35:14.730 --> 35:17.563
but he was a depressed,
moody guy.

35:17.597 --> 35:19.830
If I'd known you two had
already met through the shelter,

35:19.863 --> 35:21.296
don't you think
I would've told you?

35:21.330 --> 35:23.697
I wish you had.

35:23.730 --> 35:25.463
Because considering
the amount of money

35:25.496 --> 35:28.730
he was planning on leaving
me, it would've been nice

35:28.763 --> 35:31.763
to get to know him
a little better.

35:31.797 --> 35:33.830
Maybe even have him
over for dinner.

35:33.863 --> 35:36.296
Now, that would have been
a fascinating dinner.

35:36.330 --> 35:38.096
You, your best friend,

35:38.129 --> 35:39.997
and the woman you were seeing
behind his back.

35:41.330 --> 35:42.496
Might have made it
more difficult

35:42.530 --> 35:43.863
convincing him to let you
shoot him, though.

35:43.897 --> 35:47.597
Look, Morgan was killed
by a stranger,

35:47.630 --> 35:49.163
a mugger.

35:49.196 --> 35:51.463
I know you're under
a lot of pressure.

35:51.496 --> 35:54.129
I'm sorry you're having trouble
finding the person who did this.

35:54.163 --> 35:56.129
But if you think
I'm gonna stand here

35:56.163 --> 35:58.797
and let you
accuse me of...

35:58.830 --> 35:59.930
of hurting my friend...

35:59.964 --> 36:02.663
Funny thing about muggings,
Mr. Lewin--

36:02.697 --> 36:03.930
the money that gets stolen

36:03.964 --> 36:05.563
often doesn't stay
with the mugger very long.

36:05.597 --> 36:07.064
It gets spent.

36:07.096 --> 36:09.997
Which is unfortunate, because
it frequently contains evidence

36:10.030 --> 36:12.863
that connects the mugger
to the crime.

36:12.897 --> 36:14.229
SCANLON:
At the very least,

36:14.263 --> 36:16.763
you might find
the perpetrator's fingerprints.

36:16.797 --> 36:19.030
At most, if it was a violent
mugging, there could be

36:19.064 --> 36:21.064
microscopic amounts of blood
spatter from the victim.

36:21.096 --> 36:23.463
Can't get much more violent
than a bullet to the brain,

36:23.496 --> 36:24.830
can you, Mr. Lewin?

36:24.863 --> 36:27.797
You know,

36:27.830 --> 36:29.797
I wish you could find the money.

36:29.830 --> 36:31.563
You know why?

36:31.597 --> 36:33.830
Because I know if it had
that evidence on it,

36:33.863 --> 36:35.797
that blood you're talking about,

36:35.830 --> 36:37.330
it would absolutely
prove my innocence.

36:37.363 --> 36:39.196
Unfortunately,
for both of us,

36:39.229 --> 36:41.330
you're probably right.

36:41.363 --> 36:42.597
It probably was spent.

36:42.630 --> 36:44.263
Which means it could be
anywhere by now.

36:44.296 --> 36:46.396
Well, maybe not anywhere.

36:46.430 --> 36:48.430
Turns out the $500

36:48.463 --> 36:51.129
Mr. Turley withdrew
from that ATM was spent

36:51.163 --> 36:54.663
at a pawn shop downtown the very
same night he was murdered.

36:54.697 --> 36:58.263
The owner said he only made
one sale that night-- a ring.

36:58.296 --> 37:00.363
A modest engagement ring.

37:02.396 --> 37:06.363
That couldn't possibly be
this ring, right?

37:06.396 --> 37:07.763
You said this belonged

37:07.797 --> 37:10.129
to yourlate mother

37:10.163 --> 37:11.229
That's right, it did.

37:11.263 --> 37:13.263
Well, that's peculiar,

37:13.296 --> 37:15.129
because when we showed
your picture to the owner,

37:15.163 --> 37:17.897
he identified you as the only
customer he had that evening.

37:17.930 --> 37:19.263
He even let a few of

37:19.296 --> 37:20.997
our lab techs take a look
at the money

37:21.030 --> 37:22.363
that was still
in the cash register.

37:22.396 --> 37:24.096
We found the evidence
we were looking for

37:24.129 --> 37:26.096
on this 20, Mr. Lewin.

37:26.129 --> 37:28.463
Morgan's blood,
your fingerprints.

37:28.496 --> 37:31.530
Mr. Lewin, you're under arrest
for the murder of Morgan Turley.

37:31.563 --> 37:33.730
You have the right
to remain silent.

37:33.730 --> 37:35.129
Anything you say
can and will be used

37:35.163 --> 37:36.363
against you
in a court of law.

37:36.396 --> 37:37.363
I don't understand.

37:37.396 --> 37:38.430
You have the right to counsel...

37:38.463 --> 37:40.997
I didn't tell anyone
I went to that shop.

37:41.030 --> 37:42.630
How could you possibly...?

37:42.663 --> 37:43.930
We received a tip

37:43.964 --> 37:46.630
late last night that pretty much
gave us everything we needed.

37:46.663 --> 37:48.163
From who?

37:48.196 --> 37:49.430
From someone who knows

37:49.463 --> 37:51.363
what it means to be a friend.

37:51.396 --> 37:54.763
From someone who knows
what it means to be loyal.

38:30.463 --> 38:32.496
You did the right
thing, you know.

38:32.530 --> 38:34.463
I know.

38:34.496 --> 38:35.997
I just...

38:36.030 --> 38:38.430
I hate to see
her so sad.

38:38.463 --> 38:40.897
Plus, now the
insurance company's

38:40.930 --> 38:44.263
gonna make her give
back the money.

38:44.296 --> 38:46.763
I really did a
horrible thing.

38:46.797 --> 38:48.129
I don't know.

38:48.163 --> 38:51.797
This Cadence girl--
least as far as I can tell--

38:51.830 --> 38:53.296
she doesn't strike me
as the kind

38:53.330 --> 38:56.064
who gets too hung up on money.

38:56.096 --> 38:59.630
I mean, I'm sure
she's gonna miss it,

38:59.663 --> 39:03.463
but I have a feeling that
what she'll always remember

39:03.496 --> 39:05.330
is that once upon a time,

39:05.363 --> 39:08.229
there was a man who cared
so deeply about her,

39:08.263 --> 39:10.797
he was actually willing
to give up everything

39:10.830 --> 39:14.129
for her.

39:14.163 --> 39:16.830
I think that's
a pretty good thing.

39:16.863 --> 39:19.530
It ain't a million bucks.

39:19.563 --> 39:22.196
But I think that's
a pretty good thing.

39:22.229 --> 39:24.897
Now, come on.

39:24.930 --> 39:29.163
I'm getting a little
sick of this view.

39:29.196 --> 39:32.263
What say we both move

39:32.296 --> 39:34.263
onward and upward,
if you know what I mean?

39:36.964 --> 39:40.530
You know, Vincent, I'm
really glad we met.

39:40.563 --> 39:43.096
You're a true pal.

39:43.129 --> 39:44.697
Likewise, Morgy.

39:44.730 --> 39:46.697
Likewise.

40:09.530 --> 40:11.930
What's going on?

40:11.964 --> 40:12.930
You okay?

40:12.964 --> 40:14.797
I'm better than okay.

40:14.830 --> 40:16.964
I'm good.

40:16.997 --> 40:19.863
I'm great.

40:19.897 --> 40:22.897
And I'm so happy I'm not
going through this alone.

40:25.697 --> 40:29.196
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

40:31.363 --> 40:34.229
That's okay, pal.
