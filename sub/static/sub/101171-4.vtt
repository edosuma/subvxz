WEBVTT

00:07.586 --> 00:09.931
- Hey, what do you say we both
jump in and not look back?

00:10.000 --> 00:12.206
- Debby,
I have a cat at home.

00:12.275 --> 00:15.206
- Fair enough.

00:15.275 --> 00:16.517
You know,
before I let you go,

00:16.586 --> 00:18.172
I wouldn't feel right
if I didn't mention

00:18.241 --> 00:22.068
our expanded security extended
warranty one more time.

00:22.137 --> 00:23.931
- You know what?
Let's do it.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.275
- Great! I'll update
the agreement and email you.

00:26.344 --> 00:29.965
- Hey, Debby, have you seen
that 2020 blue Scimitar--

00:30.034 --> 00:32.068
- I'm with a customer.

00:32.137 --> 00:35.655
Why don't you check the lot,
Vicky?

00:35.724 --> 00:38.000
- Good--yeah--good--thank you.
Okay.

00:38.068 --> 00:40.758
- I mean, if she doesn't know
where it is, why would I?

00:40.827 --> 00:42.448
You're gonna love that Sun Gem,

00:42.517 --> 00:44.827
and I hope you enjoyed
your experience with me.

00:44.896 --> 00:48.275
Would you say it was
a five out of five stars?

00:48.344 --> 00:50.620
- Um, yeah.
Yes.

00:50.689 --> 00:52.965
- Great! I'd consider
anything less a failure,

00:53.034 --> 00:55.000
and so would Jupiter.

00:55.068 --> 00:58.137
You might be contacted
to participate in a survey.

00:58.206 --> 01:00.586
It'd mean the world to me if
you gave me five out of five.

01:00.655 --> 01:02.344
- Great.
Well, thanks for the help.

01:02.413 --> 01:05.000
- You bet.

01:05.068 --> 01:07.482
Don't forget,
five out of five.

01:07.551 --> 01:08.689
- Got it.

01:08.758 --> 01:10.172
- Good.

01:14.758 --> 01:16.137
- Hello?
- Hi, Jacob.

01:16.206 --> 01:18.517
Congratulations
on your new Jupiter Sun Gem.

01:18.586 --> 01:20.965
We'd love you to take a brief
survey about your experience--

01:26.241 --> 01:28.034
- Sorry.
Forgot to give this to you.

01:28.103 --> 01:30.034
It's a paper copy
of the survey

01:30.103 --> 01:31.793
in case you're an old-fashioned
kind of guy.

01:31.862 --> 01:34.896
- Yes. Thank you, Debby.
Bye.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.862
- Five out of five!

01:44.034 --> 01:45.103
Five out of five.

02:04.344 --> 02:06.413
- Can you believe
it's only been six months

02:06.482 --> 02:08.034
since your last
performance review?

02:08.103 --> 02:09.586
Wow. Where to begin?

02:09.655 --> 02:11.379
I guess,
let's start at the top.

02:11.448 --> 02:13.103
Your hair is disgusting.
Everybody can tell

02:13.172 --> 02:14.620
you're using
shampoo-conditioner combo.

02:14.689 --> 02:16.068
Moving down the skull,
you're starting to get

02:16.137 --> 02:17.620
bags under your eyes like Jake,

02:17.689 --> 02:19.344
and it's making harder
to tell you apart.

02:19.413 --> 02:21.724
- On a positive note,
you are not a fraud,

02:21.793 --> 02:23.793
but that's only because
you failed to fool anyone

02:23.862 --> 02:25.137
into thinking
you are remotely competent.

02:25.206 --> 02:27.379
On a negative note,

02:27.448 --> 02:29.137
you're an absolute fool.

02:29.206 --> 02:30.896
And you're checking your phone
in the middle

02:30.965 --> 02:32.482
of a performance review.

02:32.551 --> 02:34.793
- Your knees
are knobby as all hell,

02:34.862 --> 02:37.000
just two big,
horrifying knobs.

02:37.068 --> 02:39.586
I'd turn them, but I'm afraid
what lurks behind those doors.

02:39.655 --> 02:41.034
I'll skip
your splinty shins for now,

02:41.103 --> 02:42.620
but we both know
your toes are weird,

02:42.689 --> 02:43.931
and last but not least,

02:44.000 --> 02:46.103
we know from our screen
monitoring program

02:46.172 --> 02:48.344
you've been watching
movies at work.

02:48.413 --> 02:50.862
And you have terrible taste.

02:50.931 --> 02:53.965
In summation, your job
is hanging by a thread,

02:54.034 --> 02:57.241
and you're living
in a scissors factory.

02:57.310 --> 03:00.655
- Well, John,
some of those adjectives

03:00.724 --> 03:03.034
will haunt me
for the rest of my life.

03:03.103 --> 03:04.206
- Right.
- You clearly put

03:04.275 --> 03:07.413
a lot of thought into that,
so...

03:07.482 --> 03:08.827
good job.

03:11.482 --> 03:16.310
- Sorry, you're telling me
that I did a good job

03:16.379 --> 03:18.241
on your performance review?

03:21.034 --> 03:23.965
- Yeah?

03:24.034 --> 03:26.000
- Great.

03:26.068 --> 03:27.551
Thank you, Matt.

03:27.620 --> 03:29.482
I did do a good job.

03:30.758 --> 03:32.172
And hey,
all that stuff about your job

03:32.241 --> 03:33.689
hanging by a thread,
you know I'm just

03:33.758 --> 03:35.310
trying to motivate you, right?

03:35.379 --> 03:37.172
I mean, if the lion tamer
doesn't crack the whip,

03:37.241 --> 03:39.448
the lions start thinking
he doesn't have a whip.

03:39.517 --> 03:41.000
You catch my drift?
I don't know if you've ever

03:41.068 --> 03:42.689
seen lions
turn on their master,

03:42.758 --> 03:45.758
but there's a reason that
I stopped watching lion videos.

03:45.827 --> 03:48.793
- That's a really effective
analogy, John.

03:48.862 --> 03:50.448
Good job.

03:50.517 --> 03:51.655
- Great.

03:51.724 --> 03:53.310
- "Hi, Jacob,
it's been three days

03:53.379 --> 03:54.793
"since you purchased
your Sun Gem,

03:54.862 --> 03:56.965
"and Jupiter hasn't received
your survey results yet.

03:57.034 --> 03:58.827
"As you know,
anything less than a five

03:58.896 --> 04:00.103
is seen as failure."

04:00.172 --> 04:01.172
- Why don't you just
fill out the survey?

04:01.241 --> 04:02.413
It'll take ten seconds.

04:02.482 --> 04:03.724
- Every day,
there's some new bullshit

04:03.793 --> 04:05.931
for me to rate and review.
It's driving me insane.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.413
- I feel guilty if I don't give
everyone positive feedback.

04:08.482 --> 04:10.241
I give all my Lyft drivers
five stars,

04:10.310 --> 04:11.275
even the racist ones.

04:11.344 --> 04:13.068
- Knock, knock.
Hey, Matt,

04:13.137 --> 04:15.827
I remember that you've got
a sharp eye for graphic design,

04:15.896 --> 04:19.413
so I was wondering
what you think of the font

04:19.482 --> 04:22.655
on the heading here.
Let's get you down here, buddy.

04:23.620 --> 04:26.137
- Um, looks fine.

04:27.517 --> 04:30.068
Just fine?
Or...

04:30.137 --> 04:33.758
- Um, I mean,
it looks great.

04:33.827 --> 04:34.758
Good job, John.

04:34.827 --> 04:37.413
- Great.

04:37.482 --> 04:40.241
Oh. Having trouble deciding
what you're gonna watch?

04:40.310 --> 04:42.241
- No, I wasn't--
- Easy answer.

04:42.310 --> 04:44.310
The doc about those Thai boys

04:44.379 --> 04:46.068
who got stuck
in that evil cave.

04:46.137 --> 04:47.862
I rated it a must-see.

04:47.931 --> 04:50.241
You do remember the Thai boys,
don't you, Matt?

04:50.310 --> 04:52.310
Oh, dear Christ, you haven't
forgotten the Thai boys?

04:52.379 --> 04:55.241
- Oh, no, yeah, I remember
reading about those guys.

04:55.310 --> 04:57.241
Um, I just don't have
a cable login, so--

04:57.310 --> 04:58.379
- Well, no one does, Matt.

04:58.448 --> 05:00.689
Well,
except my wife's grandfather.

05:00.758 --> 05:03.655
He died, but his cable
subscription lives on.

05:03.724 --> 05:06.310
Nice little windfall
for the wife and me.

05:06.379 --> 05:08.344
I'll give you the password.
Go ahead, write this down.

05:08.413 --> 05:10.413
Jake, earmuffs.

05:13.379 --> 05:14.862
The password
is "JakeEarmuffs."

05:14.931 --> 05:16.758
- Oh.
- Yeah.

05:16.827 --> 05:19.413
Jake, what are you doing
with your hands?

05:19.482 --> 05:21.068
It's not winter.

05:21.137 --> 05:24.482
- They told me I was shy
in my performance review.

05:24.551 --> 05:27.482
You know the synonyms for shy?
I looked them up.

05:27.551 --> 05:31.310
Meek, reticent,
sheepish, mousy.

05:31.379 --> 05:32.758
How can I be a sheep
and a mouse?

05:32.827 --> 05:34.931
- You aren't shy.
Someone calls you shy,

05:35.000 --> 05:36.758
it just means they don't know
anything about you.

05:36.827 --> 05:38.413
It's like when someone
gives you a candle as a gift.

05:38.482 --> 05:39.655
- Yeah.

05:39.724 --> 05:41.827
- Didn't you get me a candle
for my birthday?

05:41.896 --> 05:44.068
- Yeah, but that's because
you're a sheepish candle mouse.

05:46.482 --> 05:49.965
No. You don't get to know
how I feel about you.

05:50.034 --> 05:51.034
- Sorry about him.

05:51.103 --> 05:52.586
I think
you're doing a good job.

05:52.655 --> 05:55.241
- Whoa, no, you don't.
This is on me.

05:55.310 --> 05:56.310
- Oh, thanks, John.

05:56.379 --> 05:58.206
- Let's do a working lunch.

05:58.275 --> 05:59.586
- Okay.

05:59.655 --> 06:00.758
- At this point,
I wouldn't be surprised

06:00.827 --> 06:02.551
if Debby showed up at my house
with a gun.

06:02.620 --> 06:04.482
- That's why I use
a fake address

06:04.551 --> 06:06.724
when I buy
literally everything.

06:06.793 --> 06:08.344
- Doesn't that make it hard
to get deliveries?

06:08.413 --> 06:09.482
- Yeah.

06:09.551 --> 06:10.862
It's ruining my life.

06:12.551 --> 06:15.379
- Uh-oh. I haven't said
a word in ten minutes.

06:15.448 --> 06:18.206
No one seems to have noticed.
Of course, they haven't.

06:18.275 --> 06:20.103
They think I'm shy,
and I'm sitting here

06:20.172 --> 06:21.862
giving them mountains
of evidence.

06:21.931 --> 06:24.000
If only I could find an in.

06:24.068 --> 06:25.517
- What about you, Grace?

06:29.896 --> 06:31.068
- Um...I--

06:31.137 --> 06:32.862
- Oh, did I tell you guys
about the survey

06:32.931 --> 06:34.068
I had to do about a survey?

06:34.137 --> 06:35.896
- No.

06:35.965 --> 06:39.000
- Here likes Grace,
who was shy.

06:39.068 --> 06:41.551
No, no,
that's too much for me.

06:41.620 --> 06:44.206
Mine will be
an unmarked grave.

06:44.275 --> 06:46.551
- All right,
one more.

06:46.620 --> 06:48.793
Go ahead
and give me your worst.

06:48.862 --> 06:51.482
I really shit the bed on this.

06:51.551 --> 06:53.448
- No, John,
I think you did a good job.

06:55.655 --> 06:57.689
I didn't shit the bed.

07:00.620 --> 07:02.000
- Good job, John.

07:02.068 --> 07:03.620
- Great.

07:03.689 --> 07:06.896
Okay, three-pointer.

07:09.310 --> 07:11.103
Damn it.

07:11.172 --> 07:13.931
Okay, recalibrate.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.137
Open wider.

07:15.206 --> 07:16.310
- Ah!

07:16.379 --> 07:19.241
- Let me get
pitcher's stance on this.

07:19.310 --> 07:21.931
You gotta call the pitch, Matt.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.344
Uh-uh.
I want to toss something funky.

07:24.413 --> 07:27.172
I'm Randy Johnson,
and you're that poor bird.

07:41.689 --> 07:43.310
- Hello?
- Hello, Jacob,

07:43.379 --> 07:45.827
and congratulations
on your new Jupiter Sun Gem.

07:45.896 --> 07:48.137
We'd love to get your feedback
on your experience.

07:48.206 --> 07:49.586
- Hi, Jacob.

07:49.655 --> 07:50.931
It's your pal Debby Deberson,

07:51.000 --> 07:52.068
just checking in about
that survey.

07:52.137 --> 07:53.620
- Hello, Jacob,

07:53.689 --> 07:55.689
and congratulations
on your new Jupiter Sun Gem.

07:55.758 --> 07:56.931
- Hi, Jacob.

08:00.310 --> 08:01.689
Guess who?
It's Debby.

08:01.758 --> 08:03.758
Don't make me beg
for a five out of five.

08:18.241 --> 08:20.034
- Hi, Jacob.

08:22.793 --> 08:23.896
- What are you doing
at my house?

08:23.965 --> 08:24.724
- It's been a week.
You still haven't

08:24.793 --> 08:26.034
filled out that survey.

08:26.103 --> 08:27.586
I was worried
something happened to you.

08:27.655 --> 08:29.931
But, you know, luckily I had
your address in the paperwork.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
You know, I really need
that five out of five.

08:32.068 --> 08:33.586
- You want me
to take the survey, Debby?

08:33.655 --> 08:35.448
Fine.
I'll take the survey.

08:35.517 --> 08:37.724
- Thank you.

08:37.793 --> 08:39.551
- "On a scale of one to five,

08:39.620 --> 08:43.413
how would you rate your overall
customer experience?"

08:43.482 --> 08:44.896
Mmm...

08:46.896 --> 08:48.620
Four.

08:48.689 --> 08:50.206
"On a scale of one to five,

08:50.275 --> 08:52.068
"how likely are you to purchase
or lease a car

08:52.137 --> 08:53.379
from us in the future?"

08:53.448 --> 08:55.000
I would say four.

08:55.068 --> 08:57.068
- Jacob, don't do this.

08:57.137 --> 08:58.758
- "On a scale of one to five,

08:58.827 --> 09:02.413
how would you rate your
salesperson Debby Deberson?"

09:02.482 --> 09:04.068
Oh, God, another tough one.

09:04.137 --> 09:07.793
Maybe four out of five,
and submit.

09:11.275 --> 09:13.275
- Whoa. Are you okay?

09:13.344 --> 09:15.275
- Do you understand
what you've done?

09:15.344 --> 09:17.448
- I just gave you four stars.
That's a solid B-minus.

09:17.517 --> 09:19.551
- You just put
a target on my back,

09:19.620 --> 09:20.965
and my front!

09:21.034 --> 09:23.655
You have no idea what
these people are capable of!

09:23.724 --> 09:27.068
I should give you one star
as a person, you bitch!

09:28.551 --> 09:30.724
- Too bad
there isn't a survey for that.

09:30.793 --> 09:32.448
It's been two days,
and so far,

09:32.517 --> 09:35.793
no emails, no calls,
and no texts.

09:35.862 --> 09:37.931
After she left,
I burned all the surveys

09:38.000 --> 09:39.758
they mailed me on my stove.

09:39.827 --> 09:42.103
Was it a little?
Yes.

09:42.172 --> 09:43.655
And that's why it felt so good.

09:43.724 --> 09:44.758
- I don't know.

09:44.827 --> 09:46.103
Four out of five
is pretty harsh.

09:46.172 --> 09:48.793
You might as well
have given her a one.

09:48.862 --> 09:50.517
- Hey, Jake, you seen Matt?

09:50.586 --> 09:51.793
- I haven't.
Sorry.

09:51.862 --> 09:53.310
- Hold on.

09:53.379 --> 09:58.000
I'd recognize
that knobby knee anywhere.

09:58.068 --> 09:59.310
Matt!

09:59.379 --> 10:00.758
Look at you,
holed up down here

10:00.827 --> 10:02.482
like a little Thai boy.

10:02.551 --> 10:04.793
You sure have grown
since you went in the cave.

10:04.862 --> 10:07.344
Come on.

10:08.344 --> 10:10.448
You did watch the doc, right?

10:10.517 --> 10:14.103
- Yes, John, and good job
on the recommendation.

10:14.172 --> 10:15.379
So what do you need?

10:15.448 --> 10:17.827
- Well, since you loved
those Thai boys so much,

10:17.896 --> 10:22.655
what do you think
of this boy's tie?

10:22.724 --> 10:23.931
- I really have a lot of work
to do, John.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.620
- That can wait.

10:25.689 --> 10:27.413
Tell me what you think.

10:27.482 --> 10:29.827
Honest feedback.

10:30.827 --> 10:33.827
- You know what?
I don't like it.

10:33.896 --> 10:36.413
You look like Mr. Peanut,
even more than usual.

10:36.482 --> 10:38.448
This time,
you did a bad job.

10:42.517 --> 10:44.620
- Great.

10:51.517 --> 10:52.551
- I'm proud of you, Matt.

10:52.620 --> 10:55.137
You just gave John
a four out of five.

10:58.344 --> 11:01.000
- This is it,
easy win for Gracedog.

11:01.068 --> 11:03.379
All I have to do
is tell him "goodnight."

11:03.448 --> 11:06.172
A shy person wouldn't do that,
but I will,

11:06.241 --> 11:08.344
'cause I'm not a shy mouse.

11:08.413 --> 11:10.758
I'm a bull,
a big, proud bull

11:10.827 --> 11:13.758
with a big, fat mouth
and a golden nose ring.

11:13.827 --> 11:16.275
Here we go!

11:16.344 --> 11:17.931
Good...

11:18.000 --> 11:19.482
night.
- Security.

11:19.551 --> 11:21.379
- You think
I was too hard on John?

11:21.448 --> 11:23.862
I did really like
that Thai boys doc.

11:23.931 --> 11:25.034
I watched it twice.

11:25.103 --> 11:27.586
- Mr. Engelbertson?

11:27.655 --> 11:29.586
Phone call.

11:31.068 --> 11:32.793
- Hello?
- Matt, I need to see you

11:32.862 --> 11:34.896
in my office immediately.

11:38.275 --> 11:40.137
- Are you fucking kidding me?

11:40.206 --> 11:42.620
- I'll talk to you tomorrow.
John wants to see me.

11:42.689 --> 11:44.034
- Hi, Jacob.
- I already took

11:44.103 --> 11:45.206
the damn survey.

11:45.275 --> 11:46.758
- Oh, we received your survey.

11:46.827 --> 11:49.172
Your feedback
was very helpful.

11:49.241 --> 11:50.448
I'm calling to let you know

11:50.517 --> 11:52.724
that we've dealt
with the situation.

11:52.793 --> 11:55.000
- Oh.
What does that mean?

11:55.068 --> 11:56.172
- Customer satisfaction

11:56.241 --> 11:58.034
is our number one priority.

11:58.103 --> 11:59.551
That's why
you can rest assured

11:59.620 --> 12:01.103
that Debby Deberson

12:01.172 --> 12:03.586
will never sell
another Sun Gem...

12:03.655 --> 12:05.758
ever again.

12:05.827 --> 12:08.379
- Wow. All right.

12:08.448 --> 12:10.482
Nice to know the system works,
I guess.

12:10.551 --> 12:11.482
- Thank you for your time.

12:14.724 --> 12:16.275
- Hey, John,
about earlier,

12:16.344 --> 12:18.586
I was too hard
on your bowtie.

12:18.655 --> 12:20.758
- No, Matt.

12:20.827 --> 12:22.103
You were right.

12:22.172 --> 12:23.931
I got cocky,

12:24.000 --> 12:27.379
and tried
to pull off a bold new look.

12:27.448 --> 12:29.758
And I made an ass of myself.

12:29.827 --> 12:34.172
I was a very bad, bad,
stupid boy.

12:35.482 --> 12:37.241
And you helped me see that.

12:37.310 --> 12:38.620
So I made a big change

12:38.689 --> 12:41.586
that's gonna help
the both of us.

12:41.655 --> 12:44.172
This is your new desk.

12:44.241 --> 12:46.034
You're a harsh mistress, Matt.

12:46.103 --> 12:49.103
Well, technically a Matt-tress.

12:49.172 --> 12:50.931
A firm mattress.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.586
And I need you
to straighten me out

12:52.655 --> 12:54.793
because I don't trust
my chiropractor,

12:54.862 --> 12:56.758
that fucking crook.

13:00.103 --> 13:02.827
- John,
I'm at a loss for words.

13:02.896 --> 13:03.965
- Great.

13:04.034 --> 13:05.517
We're staying late tonight.

13:05.586 --> 13:07.862
We're gonna be holed up here
like those Thai boys,

13:07.931 --> 13:09.310
except this time,

13:09.379 --> 13:12.862
there will be no meddling
Navy SEAL here to rescue us.

13:12.931 --> 13:14.137
Take a seat.

13:14.206 --> 13:16.379
- Debby,
what did you do to Jacob?

13:16.448 --> 13:18.034
- Nothing!
- He gave you a four.

13:18.103 --> 13:19.758
- Four out of five
is a solid B-minus.

13:19.827 --> 13:20.965
- It might as well
have been a one,

13:21.034 --> 13:22.206
and you know that.

13:22.275 --> 13:23.482
- Please!
Give me another chance!

13:23.551 --> 13:24.965
- This is for Jacob.

13:25.034 --> 13:27.482
- No!

13:27.551 --> 13:29.724
- Debby's not dead.
Just being paranoid.

13:43.793 --> 13:45.275
- Jacob Levinson?

13:45.344 --> 13:47.137
Agent Roman, FBI.

13:47.206 --> 13:49.758
Did you purchase
a Sun Gem from that woman?

13:57.482 --> 13:59.931
- Aren't there usually
just two agents?

14:00.000 --> 14:01.965
- That's actually
a very hurtful stereotype.

14:02.034 --> 14:03.000
- You may not realize it,

14:03.068 --> 14:05.068
but what you just said
is racist.

14:05.137 --> 14:07.000
- Whatever this is,
it must be pretty serious

14:07.068 --> 14:09.724
for five FBI agents to show up.

14:09.793 --> 14:12.034
- I'm sorry I'm late.

14:12.103 --> 14:14.620
- Jacob, you purchased your car
from Debby Deberson.

14:14.689 --> 14:16.344
Is that correct?
- Yes.

14:16.413 --> 14:17.793
- And overall,
how would you rate

14:17.862 --> 14:19.758
your car-buying experience?

14:19.827 --> 14:21.068
- Okay,
what the hell is going on?

14:21.137 --> 14:22.206
Do you guys work for Jupiter?

14:22.275 --> 14:25.379
- Jacob,
Debby Deberson is missing.

14:27.103 --> 14:29.482
- When did you last see her?

14:29.551 --> 14:32.620
- A few days ago.
She came to my house.

14:32.689 --> 14:33.758
- So she was here.

14:33.827 --> 14:35.241
- Yeah, she kept harassing me

14:35.310 --> 14:36.827
to take some stupid survey,

14:36.896 --> 14:38.827
I gave her four out of five,
and then she left.

14:38.896 --> 14:41.689
- Jesus Christ, you must've
really hated this lady.

14:41.758 --> 14:42.965
- What did she do to you?

14:43.034 --> 14:44.724
- Four out of five
is a solid B-minus.

14:44.793 --> 14:47.862
- It's our understanding
that anything less than a five

14:47.931 --> 14:50.137
might as well be a one.

14:50.206 --> 14:51.896
- You guys don't think
she's dead, do you?

14:51.965 --> 14:54.482
- On the record,
we don't know.

14:54.551 --> 14:56.517
Off the record...

14:58.413 --> 15:00.103
- We still really aren't sure.

15:01.620 --> 15:02.655
- So now I'm worried

15:02.724 --> 15:04.862
that Jupiter killed her
or something.

15:04.931 --> 15:06.551
That's crazy, right?
I mean,

15:06.620 --> 15:08.655
there's plenty of reasons
the FBI could be involved.

15:08.724 --> 15:10.551
I mean,
maybe she's secretly

15:10.620 --> 15:12.206
a criminal mastermind
or something.

15:12.275 --> 15:13.586
- Say something, Grace.

15:13.655 --> 15:15.965
Contribute
to the conversation.

15:16.034 --> 15:18.000
- What do you guys think?

15:18.068 --> 15:19.793
- I think she's dead.

15:19.862 --> 15:21.344
And it's because of you.

15:21.413 --> 15:24.517
I broke the seal!
Now keep those lips flapping.

15:24.586 --> 15:26.862
A four out of five
is a death sentence.

15:26.931 --> 15:28.137
There's dead Debby blood

15:28.206 --> 15:30.827
all over your hideous,
hairy hands.

15:30.896 --> 15:32.482
You're killing it, Grace!

15:32.551 --> 15:34.206
Bonus points for alliteration.

15:34.275 --> 15:35.517
- I don't know about that.
- Yeah, I'm sure

15:35.586 --> 15:37.586
there's a perfectly
reasonable explanation.

15:37.655 --> 15:39.206
- Tell that to Debby.

15:39.275 --> 15:41.103
Oh, wait.
You can't.

15:41.172 --> 15:42.793
Because she's dead.

15:42.862 --> 15:44.793
Jupiter did
what they had to do.

15:44.862 --> 15:47.310
Jake just gave them the push.

15:47.379 --> 15:49.586
You were born to shine.

15:51.724 --> 15:55.034
- So anybody watch
that Thai boys doc?

15:56.275 --> 15:57.689
- Hey, Kate?

15:57.758 --> 15:59.000
John thinks
I'm in the bathroom,

15:59.068 --> 16:01.482
so I don't have much time.

16:01.551 --> 16:03.965
You know him pretty well,
right?

16:04.034 --> 16:07.517
- Well, we've worked
side by side for 19 years,

16:07.586 --> 16:09.586
so...no.

16:09.655 --> 16:11.103
I've done
everything in my power

16:11.172 --> 16:13.896
to avoid getting to know John.

16:13.965 --> 16:16.551
Do you think I haven't noticed
what's been going on?

16:16.620 --> 16:18.379
This is the freest

16:18.448 --> 16:21.275
I have felt in years!

16:21.344 --> 16:23.137
John is finally
leaving me alone.

16:23.206 --> 16:24.793
He's got you now.

16:24.862 --> 16:27.586
Today,
I read an article at lunch,

16:27.655 --> 16:29.931
a full article.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.758
- How do I make it stop?

16:31.827 --> 16:33.000
- Oh, that's easy.

16:33.068 --> 16:35.344
Just go back in time,
steal him from his crib,

16:35.413 --> 16:39.034
undo all the repressed trauma
from his childhood.

16:39.103 --> 16:40.586
Or...

16:40.655 --> 16:41.931
you can poison him.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.551
But I'd suggest doing that

16:43.620 --> 16:45.793
over the course of a few years.

16:45.862 --> 16:47.896
That's what the article
I read says.

16:47.965 --> 16:49.586
- They got it
to their sharpshooter.

16:49.655 --> 16:50.862
Top of the key.

16:50.931 --> 16:52.482
Pump fake, pump fake.
Got him up.

16:52.551 --> 16:54.517
Oh. Oh!

16:54.586 --> 16:56.448
Nothing but net.

16:56.517 --> 16:58.137
You see that, Matt?

16:58.206 --> 16:59.379
- No, I didn't.

16:59.448 --> 17:00.896
- Well, pay attention.

17:00.965 --> 17:02.310
- Thought you wanted
my eyes on these.

17:02.379 --> 17:04.517
- That's why God blessed you
with two eyes, Matt.

17:04.586 --> 17:05.793
Right?

17:05.862 --> 17:07.000
Look.

17:07.068 --> 17:08.862
Through the zone.
Get off me!

17:08.931 --> 17:10.931
Iso, iso.
Crowd roars.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.517
Johnny Stockton!

17:14.655 --> 17:16.965
Little help, Matt?

17:18.241 --> 17:19.517
Come on.

17:19.586 --> 17:21.620
Come on, John.

17:21.689 --> 17:22.758
There we go.

17:22.827 --> 17:24.137
Yep.
Come on.

17:24.206 --> 17:25.793
Top of the key.
Olympics.

17:25.862 --> 17:27.344
It's the Olympics now.

17:27.413 --> 17:28.965
- Just go back in time,

17:29.034 --> 17:31.482
and undo all the repressed
trauma from his childhood.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.655
- They got him.
This is for your country.

17:33.724 --> 17:34.965
And for myself.

17:35.034 --> 17:37.000
Oh! Oh!

17:37.068 --> 17:39.448
Did you see that one, Matt?

17:39.517 --> 17:41.551
- I did, John.

17:42.896 --> 17:45.758
You did a good job
making that basket.

17:45.827 --> 17:47.275
You're a good boy.

17:47.344 --> 17:49.310
And a great boss.

17:49.379 --> 17:52.482
And you know what else, John?

17:52.551 --> 17:54.517
I love you.

17:56.413 --> 17:57.758
- I'm sorry.

17:57.827 --> 17:59.827
What was that?

17:59.896 --> 18:01.586
- I love you, buddy.

18:01.655 --> 18:04.586
And I'm so proud of you.

18:08.793 --> 18:10.586
- God damn it, Matt.

18:10.655 --> 18:14.034
There's a line,
and as usual,

18:14.103 --> 18:16.758
you use those long,
repulsive legs

18:16.827 --> 18:19.000
to leap right over it.

18:19.068 --> 18:20.862
I'm your boss,
for Christ sake!

18:20.931 --> 18:23.344
I'll say
who loves who around here!

18:23.413 --> 18:25.344
And the only thing that I love

18:25.413 --> 18:27.896
is professionalism
in the workplace!

18:27.965 --> 18:30.034
So get the fuck out!

18:30.103 --> 18:33.172
And you can forget about
re-watching that Thai boys doc!

18:33.241 --> 18:37.655
Because I'm changing
the password to Boundaries123!

18:37.724 --> 18:39.310
Oh, damn it.
Now he knows the new one.

18:42.068 --> 18:42.827
- You'd be surprised
by how many cars

18:42.896 --> 18:44.275
crash into mailboxes,

18:44.344 --> 18:47.586
right up there with fire
hydrants and outdoor weddings.

18:47.655 --> 18:50.620
Fortunately, you're covered
for all the damages.

18:50.689 --> 18:53.241
You were smart
to get that extended warranty.

18:53.310 --> 18:54.448
- I wasn't going to,

18:54.517 --> 18:56.862
but then Debby
talked me into it.

18:57.931 --> 18:59.379
You know Debby, right?

19:01.620 --> 19:04.172
- Yes, I knew Debby.

19:04.241 --> 19:05.862
- Do you know
what happened to her?

19:05.931 --> 19:08.586
- The company really doesn't
want us to talk about it.

19:08.655 --> 19:10.689
- Why not?
What happened?

19:10.758 --> 19:12.586
- I'm sorry, Jacob.
I really can't say.

19:12.655 --> 19:15.965
But have I answered
all your questions today?

19:16.034 --> 19:18.379
- No, you clearly haven't.

19:18.448 --> 19:20.862
- Well,
that's very unfortunate

19:20.931 --> 19:25.034
because customer satisfaction
is our number one priority,

19:25.103 --> 19:26.413
and the thing is,
you're gonna receive

19:26.482 --> 19:27.758
a survey about your--
- This is for Jacob.

19:27.827 --> 19:28.896
- No!

19:28.965 --> 19:31.241
- And anything less
than a five is--

19:31.310 --> 19:33.068
- Five out of five!

19:33.137 --> 19:35.689
You get a five out of five.

19:35.758 --> 19:37.034
Five out of five!

19:37.103 --> 19:39.517
I'm completely satisfied
with my experience,

19:39.586 --> 19:41.551
and I want everyone to know!

19:41.620 --> 19:43.551
Five out of five.
Five out of five.

19:43.620 --> 19:45.103
Five out of five.
Five out of five.

19:45.172 --> 19:46.689
Five out of five!

19:49.758 --> 19:52.793
- Debby Deberson.
Wow!

19:52.862 --> 19:55.793
It was not easy
tracking you down.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.206
It's quite a game
you were running,

19:57.275 --> 20:00.206
masquerading
as the five-star employee,

20:00.275 --> 20:01.965
the person on the inside

20:02.034 --> 20:05.517
funneling cars
to a ring of thieves.

20:05.586 --> 20:09.655
- At last, we've caught
the queen of car lot larceny.

20:09.724 --> 20:11.241
Want to know
how we finally did it?

20:11.310 --> 20:13.068
- It was Jacob's
four-star review, wasn't it?

20:13.137 --> 20:14.689
- No.

20:14.758 --> 20:17.551
Actually, it was...

20:17.620 --> 20:19.551
just one star.

20:19.620 --> 20:22.517
This was a blue
2020 Jupiter Scimitar

20:22.586 --> 20:25.551
that we recovered from a boat
headed to Venezuela.

20:25.620 --> 20:29.689
And from there, we just put
all the pieces together.

20:29.758 --> 20:31.241
- Hey, Agent Roman?

20:31.310 --> 20:32.862
- Yeah?

20:32.931 --> 20:35.000
- Good job.

20:35.068 --> 20:36.275
- Oh.

20:45.551 --> 20:47.793
- Five out of five.

20:47.862 --> 20:48.793
- Sorry I'm late.

20:52.517 --> 20:54.448
- Make that six out of five.
