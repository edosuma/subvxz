You need to swear to me
you'll get rid of those cells.

-She has a baby.
-Where is it?

00:22.598 --> 00:24.265
[Ryn]
<i> In the water, with the males.</i>

00:24.341 --> 00:28.176
[man]
The song, it could do something
like this to the human brain.

00:28.254 --> 00:30.512
[Ryn] There is a place
where sound heals.

00:30.590 --> 00:31.864
Not dark anymore.

00:31.941 --> 00:34.033
Whatever you were exposed
to down there, it helped.

00:37.947 --> 00:38.779
-[remote beeps]
-[explosions]

00:40.767 --> 00:41.949
The Russians.

00:42.026 --> 00:43.284
They made my song a weapon.

00:45.938 --> 00:47.046
[chanting over computer]

00:49.125 --> 00:51.033
I now pronounce you

Ah!

Xander!

[indistinct chattering]

01:07.794 --> 01:09.627
Hey, help! Help!
Is anyone in here?

01:09.629 --> 01:11.570
We need help!
We need help!

01:11.647 --> 01:13.297
I'm here. I got you.

01:13.299 --> 01:16.317
[Maddie] There's something wrong
with him. Please, help him.

01:16.393 --> 01:18.411
-What happened?
-[Ben] He collapsed.

01:18.487 --> 01:20.654
Xander, stay with me.

01:20.731 --> 01:24.733
Crash Team to triage.
I repeat, Crash Team to triage.

01:24.811 --> 01:25.918
What's going on?

01:25.995 --> 01:27.920
Possible brain bleed.
Pulse at 37.

01:27.997 --> 01:30.072
-Left pupil fixed and dilated.
-Get me full vitals.

01:30.149 --> 01:32.316
EKG, chest x-ray
and page Neurology, stat.

01:32.318 --> 01:34.710
-Crash Team coming through.
-[Ben] Xander, stay with me.

01:36.823 --> 01:38.172
[doctor]
Okay, what do we have?

01:38.248 --> 01:40.491
[nurse] Bleeding from the ear.
Loss of consciousness.

01:40.493 --> 01:43.344
[doctor]
All right, up we go.
You page Neurology.

01:43.420 --> 01:44.753
[Riley]
Okay. Get his heart rate?

01:44.831 --> 01:47.832
-[nurse] I'm grabbing the IV.
-[Riley] Stay with us.

01:47.834 --> 01:49.350
We need to get going.
Hey, prep the room.

01:49.426 --> 01:50.517
Heart rate is 30 and falling.

01:50.594 --> 01:52.002
Were you with him
when this happened?

01:52.004 --> 01:53.946
-Yes.
-That's right.

01:54.023 --> 01:56.190
[Riley]
Come with me.

01:56.266 --> 01:57.933
We were at a wedding.
He was doing fine.

01:58.010 --> 01:59.677
Just normal,
and then he answered the phone

01:59.679 --> 02:01.011
and went down.

02:01.013 --> 02:02.363
He looked kind of stunned
when he fell.

02:02.439 --> 02:05.182
-Blood just came out of his ear.
-History of seizures?

02:05.184 --> 02:07.852
Okay, you guys stay here.
We're going to run some tests.

02:07.854 --> 02:08.243
I'll bring you back.

02:12.692 --> 02:13.207

[grunts]

02:56.085 --> 02:57.568
[Riley]
Hey, here's what we know so far.

02:57.570 --> 03:01.405
We ruled out stroke, pulmonary
embolism and heart attack.

03:01.407 --> 03:05.667
We then did a cranial
CT scan with contrast.

03:05.745 --> 03:07.261
His brain is in
a degenerative state.

03:07.337 --> 03:10.672
You guys say there weren't any
symptoms prior to the collapse?

03:10.750 --> 03:12.433
No.

03:14.754 --> 03:16.587
Any unusual activities recently?

03:16.589 --> 03:17.646
He helped with my sister's body.

03:20.760 --> 03:23.685
Uh, there was a funeral.
It's been hard.

03:23.763 --> 03:24.703
So stress could be a factor.

03:28.451 --> 03:30.768
-Yeah.
-I'll run some more tests

03:30.770 --> 03:31.118
-and I'll keep you posted.
-[Ben] Thank you.

03:34.273 --> 03:35.697
His brain looks
like Decker's.

03:35.775 --> 03:37.032
Worse than Decker's.

03:37.109 --> 03:38.776
His phone.

03:38.778 --> 03:40.202
It happened after
when he picked up.

03:40.279 --> 03:42.780
-Hear anything?
-No. But it's got
to be connected.

03:42.782 --> 03:44.281
This is damage
from the song.

03:44.283 --> 03:46.951
Tia. She played it
through the phone.

03:46.953 --> 03:48.394
[Maddie]
His phone, let me check.

03:55.962 --> 03:57.478
Here's his call history.

03:57.554 --> 04:01.574
He got an unknown call
at 8:27 p.m.

04:01.650 --> 04:05.244
I got a call from
the same number at 8:27.

04:05.321 --> 04:08.655
Me too. Exact same time.

04:08.732 --> 04:09.748
She was trying
to take us all out at once.

04:09.825 --> 04:12.251
She only got through
to Xander.

04:12.328 --> 04:13.494
She's not going to stop here.

04:52.535 --> 04:54.201
[Ben]
This was Tia's plan all along.

04:54.278 --> 04:56.520
She already destroyed
the echo chamber recording.

04:56.522 --> 04:58.539
There's no antidote.
no way to help.

04:58.615 --> 05:00.024
We can't even
talk to the doctors.

05:00.026 --> 05:01.449
[Maddie]
They'd never believe us.

05:01.527 --> 05:02.693
Maybe Eliza can help Xander?

05:02.695 --> 05:04.044
I'll call Helen.

05:07.199 --> 05:09.475
[Ben]
We got to contact the military.

05:09.552 --> 05:12.311
If the echo chamber
recording is gone,

05:12.388 --> 05:14.038
we need to warn them about Tia.

05:14.040 --> 05:15.264
-Patty.
-Hey.

05:17.543 --> 05:19.142
What? Xander.

05:20.971 --> 05:21.645
What's that...?

05:25.217 --> 05:26.884
What's...

05:26.886 --> 05:27.609
What's happening to him?

05:30.056 --> 05:31.664
Patty, Dr. Riley will be back

05:31.740 --> 05:33.574
to talk with you soon.

05:33.650 --> 05:34.491
O-Okay.

05:38.230 --> 05:39.913
-Any updates?
-They're still working on it.

05:39.990 --> 05:42.749
[gasps]

05:42.826 --> 05:44.068
Ryn?

05:44.070 --> 05:46.420
Ryn, are you okay?

05:46.496 --> 05:48.088
I must go.

05:48.165 --> 05:50.074
[gasping]

05:50.076 --> 05:51.425
What? What? Hey.

05:53.412 --> 05:55.003
Hope's heartbeat.

05:55.081 --> 05:56.263
It stopped.

05:56.340 --> 05:57.931
[breathing heavily]

06:02.588 --> 06:04.512
I feel it again.

06:04.590 --> 06:07.441
In human rhythm.

06:07.517 --> 06:09.943
-You think she's on land?
-Yes.

06:10.020 --> 06:11.028
I must go to her.

06:15.784 --> 06:17.876
I'll take you there.
I'll drive you.

06:17.953 --> 06:19.269
I'll stay here
and work with the medics,

06:19.271 --> 06:20.787
and try to reach
Anderson and Maeda.

06:20.864 --> 06:21.330
-You two go. Okay.
-Thank you.

06:47.800 --> 06:48.231
Something is wrong.

06:51.153 --> 06:53.470
Eliza will help.

06:53.472 --> 06:54.821
I'm very much hoping you can.

06:59.145 --> 07:00.661
She should be here.

07:00.737 --> 07:02.037
This is where
they come to land.

07:18.330 --> 07:19.938
-[Ben] That's Hope?
-[Ryn] She has grown.

07:20.015 --> 07:22.274
This is what happens to us.

07:22.351 --> 07:24.685
There's so much
I've missed.

Mama.

08:39.578 --> 08:42.746
[heart monitor beeping]

08:42.748 --> 08:45.432
We have some further information
about his condition.

08:45.509 --> 08:46.767
I want to know everything.

08:49.271 --> 08:51.755
The lesions have spread
through his cerebrum.

08:51.757 --> 08:53.607
If this continues unchecked,

08:53.683 --> 08:56.109
movement and speech
will start to be affected.

08:56.186 --> 08:57.986
His heart rate
is already very slow.

09:00.524 --> 09:01.782
So, what are you
going to do about it?

09:01.858 --> 09:05.026
The plan for right now
is to try to keep him stable

09:05.104 --> 09:06.453
while a specialist
comes in from Seattle.

09:06.530 --> 09:08.438
Specialist?

09:08.440 --> 09:09.214
Like someone
who's seen this before?

09:12.035 --> 09:14.052
I'm not sure anybody's
seen this before.

09:14.129 --> 09:15.170
[woman, over P.A.]
<i> Paging Dr. Riley...</i>

09:16.965 --> 09:17.798
Excuse me.

09:28.460 --> 09:29.793
[Ryn]
She remembers you.

09:29.795 --> 09:31.144
From when she was a baby.

09:37.303 --> 09:38.193
[gasps]

09:40.823 --> 09:42.739
You made your first kill
in the water?

09:45.902 --> 09:49.496
The waters do not
belong to us anymore.

09:49.573 --> 09:52.240
We see many dead.

09:52.318 --> 09:54.075
[Ryn]
Tia rules the water now.

09:54.153 --> 09:56.762
But she is also attacking land.

09:56.839 --> 09:58.430
She hurt Xander
with the song.

09:58.507 --> 10:00.841
We will help fight.

10:00.917 --> 10:01.341
[Ryn]
It might be too late for him.

10:03.329 --> 10:04.511
Well, there is something
you could do.

10:07.182 --> 10:10.225
The sound we found down there,
that could help cure Xander.

10:14.690 --> 10:16.106
Voices of our ancestors.

10:18.360 --> 10:19.676
I can give you
some equipment

10:19.678 --> 10:21.528
and you can record it.

10:21.605 --> 10:23.363
It is gone.

10:23.440 --> 10:25.457
What's gone?

10:25.534 --> 10:28.126
No more voices.

10:31.357 --> 10:32.130
[imitates explosion]

10:36.620 --> 10:38.545
She did this.

10:38.622 --> 10:39.805
Tia did this.

10:43.051 --> 10:43.925
[Ben] She's getting rid
of any chance of a cure.

10:46.038 --> 10:47.262
Nothing for Xander.

10:50.209 --> 10:54.728
That place was where our voices
go for their final rest.

10:54.804 --> 10:59.491
When there is no one left alive
to remember their sound.

10:59.568 --> 11:00.567
And now...

11:12.898 --> 11:14.006
All our history is destroyed.

thanks for calling back.

[Anderson, on phone]
<i> I got your message.</i>

11:36.088 --> 11:38.846
<i> Why should Xander's medical</i>
<i> problems concern us?</i>

11:38.924 --> 11:41.107
No, it's not just a medical
problem, it's the song.

11:41.184 --> 11:43.184
<i> How do you know that?</i>

11:43.262 --> 11:44.761
Because I can tell
from the brain scans.

11:44.763 --> 11:47.097
<i> The one from Russia?</i>

11:47.099 --> 11:49.708
Look, we need your help.

<i> Sit tight.</i>
<i> We'll come down to have a look.</i>

12:03.949 --> 12:05.206
Now my day's getting
way better.

I need to go in.

12:06.710 --> 12:08.560

12:08.637 --> 12:10.287
I'll need to see some ID.

12:10.289 --> 12:13.139
Sure. It's right here.

12:32.478 --> 12:34.661
Hi, Patty.

12:34.738 --> 12:36.571
-[exhales]
-Sorry for the intrusion.

12:36.648 --> 12:37.998
No, not at all.

12:44.656 --> 12:46.490
Patty, this is Eliza.

12:46.492 --> 12:49.676
She's a healer.

12:49.753 --> 12:52.012
She might be able
to offer him some relief.

12:55.334 --> 12:56.224
[sighs]

12:58.170 --> 12:59.019
Yes.

13:00.856 --> 13:01.688
Yes, that would be fine.

13:06.011 --> 13:07.511
Thank you.

Look. His heart rate.

13:39.636 --> 13:41.227
It's working.

13:56.395 --> 13:58.078
You said Hope
had her first kill.

13:58.154 --> 13:59.729
Is that why they brought her
back to you?

13:59.731 --> 14:01.898
Yes. She is now ready
for her song to come.

14:01.900 --> 14:03.675
I must teach her how.

14:03.752 --> 14:04.918
And they can't do that?

14:04.994 --> 14:07.012
Only mothers can do it.

14:14.913 --> 14:17.022
[woman]
Oh, hello there.

14:17.099 --> 14:18.690
Do you want to pet him, honey?
He's friendly.

14:29.094 --> 14:30.443
Never mind.
It's okay. Come on.

14:37.769 --> 14:40.103
Those officers,
Anderson and Maeda,

14:40.105 --> 14:41.788
said they'd come down,
have a look at Xander.

14:41.865 --> 14:44.716
What about Tia?
They need to find her.

14:46.628 --> 14:47.961
We have a visitor.

14:49.781 --> 14:51.448
-Hey.
-Hi.

14:51.450 --> 14:54.041
Patty called me.

14:54.119 --> 14:55.393
Calvin just took her
to meet the medical team.

14:55.470 --> 14:57.120
How's Xander doing?

14:57.122 --> 14:58.805
Not so good, I'm afraid.

14:58.882 --> 15:00.790
It's his brain.

15:00.792 --> 15:02.959
A stroke? So young?

15:02.961 --> 15:03.643
They don't know.

15:05.964 --> 15:07.147
[Ted]
What the hell's that?

15:10.485 --> 15:13.820
That is Eliza.
She's trying to help him.

15:13.897 --> 15:15.238
She stabilized his heart rate.

15:17.826 --> 15:19.751
You cannot be serious.
She's one of them?

15:19.828 --> 15:21.903
She's a healer, Ted.

15:21.980 --> 15:22.812

No. Never. I love Ben.

32:19.163 --> 32:21.588
-You love him,
you'll let him go.
-Dad, stop.

32:21.666 --> 32:23.423
That is not
your choice to make.

32:23.501 --> 32:25.442
[scoffs]

32:25.519 --> 32:27.169
It's all going to end
in bloodshed.

32:27.171 --> 32:29.354
Just like before.

32:29.431 --> 32:33.342
Dad? Hey, that's enough.
She's here because
she wants to help.

32:33.344 --> 32:35.010
[Ted] That's what she
wants you to think.

32:35.012 --> 32:35.936
She's in your ear, Ben.
She's in your mind.

32:36.013 --> 32:37.863
She's polluting your life.

32:41.702 --> 32:44.110
-[Ted] Oh, my God.
-[gasps]

32:44.188 --> 32:45.871
What the hell
have you done to him?

32:45.948 --> 32:47.080
[breathing heavily]

32:59.537 --> 33:02.387
I stopped injecting
the stem cells.

33:02.464 --> 33:04.982
But the change
hasn't stopped.

33:05.059 --> 33:07.151
The cells could still
be dividing.

33:07.228 --> 33:09.061
I mean, there are some
genetic mutations,

33:09.137 --> 33:11.563
once you trigger them,
they feed off the reaction.

33:11.640 --> 33:12.990
They keep going.

33:13.067 --> 33:14.717
Can you do something?

33:14.719 --> 33:15.567
Maybe.

33:17.888 --> 33:18.829
Maybe it's too late.

33:24.820 --> 33:26.170
We're together now.

33:40.578 --> 33:41.802
[turns engine off]

33:50.437 --> 33:51.520
Dad?

34:25.456 --> 34:26.305
[giggling]

34:31.629 --> 34:35.981
[Beth] I'm so glad we can be
a safe haven for Hope.

34:36.058 --> 34:37.741
This could be
the only refuge now.

34:37.818 --> 34:41.061
God knows what's going on
out there.

34:41.138 --> 34:43.972
I wonder what
we could do to help.

34:43.974 --> 34:45.991
That isn't wise, Helen.

34:46.068 --> 34:49.861
We don't want
to expose ourselves.

34:49.939 --> 34:51.814
We're the only ones
immune to it.

34:51.816 --> 34:53.590
[Cami]
Hey.

34:57.488 --> 34:59.596
[gasps]

34:59.673 --> 35:01.381
You are the best hunter
in the ocean.

35:03.160 --> 35:04.009
Well done.

35:18.843 --> 35:21.026
I mean, how could he
not help us?

35:21.103 --> 35:24.196
The whole town's
falling apart.

35:24.272 --> 35:25.789
Calls are still
rolling out.

35:25.866 --> 35:27.015
We need to stop people
from answering.

35:27.017 --> 35:28.959
We're going to have
to do this alone.

35:31.038 --> 35:34.081
There are cell phone towers
spread out all over town.

35:36.118 --> 35:38.118
What do we do?

35:38.195 --> 35:39.136
We'll take them
all out at once.

35:55.379 --> 35:57.062
I need you to get out
of the car.

35:59.400 --> 36:00.273
You will be okay?

36:16.158 --> 36:17.174

37:20.222 --> 37:21.229
[indistinct panicked shouting]

37:29.156 --> 37:32.641
Excuse me, can you tell me
if Sheriff Dale Bishop

37:32.643 --> 37:33.325
has been admitted
to the hospital?

37:37.664 --> 37:39.372
I don't have him
listed here.

37:43.487 --> 37:44.169
[overlapped shouting continuous]

37:49.326 --> 37:49.992
-[Ryn] The lights are all gone.
-[Ben] Yeah.

37:49.994 --> 37:51.268
And the cell phones too.

37:54.089 --> 37:55.330
We need to get back
to the hospital

37:55.332 --> 37:56.056
to check on Xander
and Maddie.

37:58.927 --> 38:00.185

Helen?

38:15.352 --> 38:16.243
-Hm?
-A word.

38:22.709 --> 38:24.860
The perimeter systems
are all down.

38:24.862 --> 38:25.636
[sighs]

38:28.123 --> 38:30.532
This must be connected
to the attack.

38:30.534 --> 38:32.367
We need to protect
ourselves.

38:32.369 --> 38:33.702
We should stay here tonight,
close together.

38:33.704 --> 38:35.962
We should get some supplies
from the storage room.

38:36.040 --> 38:36.930
Sure.

38:38.800 --> 38:40.967
[sighs]

over P.A.]

38:55.150 --> 38:57.559

You're here.

38:57.561 --> 38:58.743
I'm sorry I took so long.

39:00.414 --> 39:01.838
What's happening?

39:01.915 --> 39:03.582
It's so dark.

39:03.658 --> 39:05.658
Power's out.

39:05.736 --> 39:07.252
I-I don't know
what happened out there,

39:07.329 --> 39:11.181
but it's...it's crazy.

39:14.002 --> 39:15.519
Hey.

Hey.

Hey.

Pulse is at 23.
