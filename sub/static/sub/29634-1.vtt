NETFLIX PRESENTS

02:17.375 --> 02:18.542
How cool!

02:31.167 --> 02:33.542
-Gotcha!
-Nora, come here.

02:33.708 --> 02:34.792
Nora!

02:42.167 --> 02:43.583
Nora, keep still!

02:50.708 --> 02:52.042
Hello, Sara.

02:53.583 --> 02:54.583
Hello.

02:58.458 --> 03:00.833
-Have you met my daughter Nora?
-Hello.

03:02.042 --> 03:03.792
-And my husband Mikel.
-Hi, Mikel.

03:03.958 --> 03:05.333
Nice to meet you.

03:05.500 --> 03:07.958
Well, come in.
Make yourselves at home.

03:08.125 --> 03:08.833
Thanks.

03:09.125 --> 03:11.667
Sweetie, help me,
grab that suitcase over there.

03:16.583 --> 03:18.500
I think I told you on the phone.

03:19.583 --> 03:22.875
The nurse only works for six hours.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.667
-And why's that?
-It's all the insurance would cover.

03:27.667 --> 03:31.500
So we're going to have
to take it in turns caring for her.

03:31.667 --> 03:35.208
-When do you start at the hospital?
-Tomorrow.

03:45.292 --> 03:47.208
Doesn't anyone come to clean?

03:47.375 --> 03:51.208
Mum got rid of everyone,
she couldn't stand any of them.

04:27.333 --> 04:28.667
Don't be scared.

05:15.458 --> 05:16.583
Hello.

05:18.583 --> 05:19.667
I'm Anna.

05:20.708 --> 05:24.792
I changed her catheter.
Your sister said you're a nurse.

05:25.458 --> 05:26.667
Yes.

05:29.042 --> 05:32.708
She has ulcers in her kidneys
and on her back.

05:34.458 --> 05:37.083
-You know what to do, right?
-Yes, of course.

05:37.875 --> 05:40.000
Very good.
Well, I'll be back tomorrow.

05:40.167 --> 05:41.042
Thanks, Anna.

06:04.375 --> 06:06.292
Are you going to die like Daddy?

06:11.667 --> 06:15.292
That's what you'd like, right?
You little pig.

06:29.375 --> 06:31.250
She should be in a hospital,

06:32.292 --> 06:34.375
this place isn't suitable.

06:34.667 --> 06:38.042
She explicitly asked
not to be moved from here.

06:38.208 --> 06:40.375
It's a living will, so we can't...

06:40.542 --> 06:42.500
There's nothing we can do.

06:43.083 --> 06:45.833
The notary made himself
extremely clear on the matter.

06:45.958 --> 06:48.333
We'll have to move
these books from here.

06:49.625 --> 06:53.333
When Mum wakes up, she'll want to find
everything just as she left it.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.458
Victoria isn't going to wake up, Sara.

07:01.958 --> 07:03.458
Where are her things?

07:05.375 --> 07:08.042
-No, not that wardrobe.
-The key?

07:08.208 --> 07:12.083
I don't know where the key is.
Mum kept it safe.

07:13.583 --> 07:15.375
Her things are in that wardrobe.

07:32.958 --> 07:36.333
-Mummy.
-What is it?

07:36.500 --> 07:38.250
When can I see grandma?

07:39.875 --> 07:43.417
-Grandma is very sick, darling.
-I don't mind.

08:02.125 --> 08:04.417
You could have visited,

08:05.083 --> 08:07.583
even if it was just once,
in all this time.

08:09.167 --> 08:11.958
I promised myself I'd never come back.
I'm here for you.

08:13.167 --> 08:14.625
Certainly not for her.

08:15.708 --> 08:17.792
You called me and I came, to help you.

08:18.542 --> 08:21.583
And because I found a job,
or I wouldn't have been able to come.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.167
Thank you.

08:26.833 --> 08:29.083
Nora will be fine at school, you'll see.

08:32.582 --> 08:35.917
-Where do you live?
-I've rented a cottage.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
It's small,
but... it's got a lovely garden.

08:40.167 --> 08:41.207
And...

08:42.250 --> 08:45.125
-Have you met anyone in all this time?
-No.

08:45.958 --> 08:47.000
And Félix?

08:47.500 --> 08:48.875
Félix?

08:49.000 --> 08:50.792
Félix left a long time ago.

08:51.500 --> 08:53.250
He's married with three kids.

08:54.375 --> 08:57.208
Anyway, Mum didn't like Félix at all.

08:57.458 --> 08:59.958
Victoria didn't like anyone.

09:03.417 --> 09:05.000
How long has she been like that?

09:05.167 --> 09:09.042
In a coma, one month,
ever since I called you.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.250
Shut away in that room, three years.

09:15.708 --> 09:17.917
The last few months were horrible.

09:20.125 --> 09:22.542
She just talked about death.

09:24.958 --> 09:27.208
<i>She cried and moaned all the time...</i>

09:29.042 --> 09:32.167
<i>and rang that damned bell</i>
<i>like a madwoman.</i>

09:40.167 --> 09:41.417
<i>Until one day,</i>

09:42.500 --> 09:44.292
<i>she suddenly stopped shouting.</i>

09:50.958 --> 09:52.458
I went up to her room,

09:54.375 --> 09:56.083
I thought she was dead.

10:02.708 --> 10:07.458
You know? That tooth stopped hurting me
as soon as she went into a coma.

10:10.458 --> 10:13.583
But, even still, I feel as though...

10:15.333 --> 10:16.708
she's watching me.

10:18.375 --> 10:20.375
She's watching me from the corners,

10:20.708 --> 10:22.458
like when we were little.

10:44.458 --> 10:47.250
-Will you be long?
-No, I'm coming.

13:04.625 --> 13:06.333
Nora, are you there?

15:09.625 --> 15:10.792
Nora.

15:12.542 --> 15:13.792
Get back upstairs.

15:14.958 --> 15:18.208
-Daddy, I found this.
-What is it?

15:18.958 --> 15:20.042
I don't know.

15:21.875 --> 15:24.542
-Can I keep it?
-I guess. Ask your mother, go on.

15:43.167 --> 15:44.625
Have a good day.

17:29.917 --> 17:33.208
Kids, I've got a surprise for you.

17:34.042 --> 17:37.500
Let me introduce your new classmate:
Nora Fernández.

17:37.667 --> 17:39.292
She's just arrived here.

17:39.458 --> 17:42.375
I hope you'll all help her
with anything she needs.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.667
You can sit there, next to Beatriz.
She'll help you.

17:47.875 --> 17:49.042
Right, Bea?

17:49.708 --> 17:53.167
Very good.
Now, take out your maths books.

17:54.208 --> 17:57.958
I marked your exams yesterday
and half of them were terrible.

19:07.542 --> 19:08.833
Hello, Victoria.

19:09.500 --> 19:11.875
My name's Mikel, I'm your son-in-law.

19:13.583 --> 19:15.875
I've seen what you're storing
in that room.

19:16.708 --> 19:19.417
They already told me
you're a scumbag witch.

19:21.708 --> 19:23.333
And it turns out it's true.

19:31.458 --> 19:32.583
Fuck me!

19:39.625 --> 19:40.667
Hello?

19:41.917 --> 19:43.958
-Hello.
-Hello.

19:44.458 --> 19:48.250
-I'm Mikel, Alicia's husband.
-I'm Anna, the nurse.

19:48.417 --> 19:51.250
-Nice to meet you.
-I thought no one was here.

19:51.917 --> 19:53.250
Well, I was...

19:54.917 --> 19:57.333
-With the mistress?
-Yes.

19:57.500 --> 20:01.167
Yes, and... she opened an eye.

20:01.958 --> 20:04.708
That's normal, it's a nervous tic.

20:04.917 --> 20:07.000
-I'm going up.
-Yes, of course.

20:07.167 --> 20:09.167
-I have to go out.
-Very well.

20:09.333 --> 20:10.958
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

20:11.083 --> 20:13.208
Is there an electrician in the village?

20:13.375 --> 20:17.125
Of course, Mr Cotarelo.
He's got a shop in the centre.

20:57.958 --> 21:00.458
That doesn't look like
it's going to work.

21:02.333 --> 21:06.167
-Do you want to bet?
-Go on then, a beer.

21:07.083 --> 21:09.208
Let's go higher. Two.

21:10.375 --> 21:14.292
You'll love this. Three, two, one...

21:18.250 --> 21:20.500
I'm suddenly feeling really thirsty?
Aren't you?

21:21.542 --> 21:24.333
-Have you changed her nappy?
-Whose?

21:26.583 --> 21:28.375
I didn't know I had to do that.

21:29.625 --> 21:32.333
-Of course not, man.
-You're hilarious.

21:33.375 --> 21:35.042
Have you seen what's in there?

21:35.667 --> 21:36.792
Come on.

21:40.500 --> 21:41.708
Come on.

21:47.708 --> 21:49.542
We should throw all this crap out.

21:50.917 --> 21:53.625
I don't know what to say,
I'd sell it on the Internet.

21:54.667 --> 21:58.375
I'm sure some nutcase
would pay a fortune for all this.

22:07.583 --> 22:08.708
I love you.

22:19.417 --> 22:21.542
Darling,
I've been looking for work and...

22:23.708 --> 22:26.083
it's not going to be easy
to find something in my field.

22:26.458 --> 22:28.667
I even left a CV at the school,

22:28.875 --> 22:31.250
but I don't think
they need electricians.

22:32.083 --> 22:33.583
So, I was thinking...

22:34.625 --> 22:37.958
perhaps at the port
or working on a boat, I don't know.

22:47.458 --> 22:48.875
Are you listening to me?

22:50.042 --> 22:51.167
Are you alright?

22:51.958 --> 22:53.083
Yes.

22:54.542 --> 22:55.958
What's that?

22:58.958 --> 23:02.583
Fuck! Are you sure
that woman is your mother?

23:09.875 --> 23:12.750
Coinciding with
the arrival of your sister and...

23:12.917 --> 23:15.958
following your mother's
precise instructions,

23:16.125 --> 23:19.167
I've invited your uncle
Pedro Álvarez and his son Fran...

23:19.333 --> 23:20.375
Nora, go to your room.

23:20.458 --> 23:24.542
...for the advance reading
of Mrs Álvarez's will.

23:27.458 --> 23:29.958
Don't you think
she should be in a hospital?

23:30.542 --> 23:32.708
This is clearly not the best place.

23:33.667 --> 23:34.708
No.

23:35.333 --> 23:37.458
According to the medical reports.

23:37.625 --> 23:42.750
But in this case, and until clinical death
has been confirmed,

23:43.083 --> 23:46.083
we must abide by
the express wishes of your mother

23:46.250 --> 23:48.625
concerning the treatment
and care of her person.

23:48.792 --> 23:51.250
I have to open the shop,
could you hurry up, please?

23:54.083 --> 23:55.208
How old is your daughter?

23:56.167 --> 23:58.083
She's ten, almost eleven.

23:58.708 --> 23:59.792
Why do you ask?

24:05.875 --> 24:08.583
<i>Your daughter, Nora Fernández,</i>

24:10.208 --> 24:12.667
will be the universal heir
of all your mother's assets.

24:23.708 --> 24:26.875
As is usual in these cases,
until she reaches the age of majority,

24:27.708 --> 24:30.625
<i>you will be responsible</i>
<i>for the administration of her assets.</i>

24:30.792 --> 24:34.917
<i>All of which, from meeting her,</i>
<i>having observed the single act...</i>

24:46.125 --> 24:47.500
There must be some mistake.

24:48.500 --> 24:50.375
I don't understand.
No, it can't be...

24:55.667 --> 24:56.583
Good day.

25:37.167 --> 25:38.750
What do you want, grandma?

25:39.667 --> 25:41.458
Why did you call me?

25:44.000 --> 25:47.958
This room... just for me?

25:49.250 --> 25:51.000
Of course I'd like it.

25:56.458 --> 25:57.542
What are you doing here?

26:01.542 --> 26:04.333
Darling, I know you really want
to be with your grandma,

26:04.708 --> 26:06.208
but you have to wait a while.

26:06.375 --> 26:10.083
You have to let her rest,
so she can get better, OK?

26:10.583 --> 26:11.792
Come on, let's go.

26:12.792 --> 26:16.458
-Why is Uncle Fran missing a finger?
-Uncle Fran is missing a finger?

26:16.625 --> 26:18.958
I didn't notice,
he must have had an accident.

26:51.667 --> 26:52.583
But...

26:53.208 --> 26:55.458
She never even met her.

26:56.500 --> 26:59.083
She never even showed
any interest in the girl...

26:59.250 --> 27:00.458
Calm down, Sara.

27:00.708 --> 27:03.375
Darling, darling,

27:03.875 --> 27:05.000
is everything alright?

27:05.458 --> 27:06.667
Yes, everything's fine.

27:07.042 --> 27:08.500
We'll be outside.

27:10.458 --> 27:12.792
Perhaps it's her way
of reconciling with Alicia.

27:12.958 --> 27:14.958
She should have tried that before.

27:15.458 --> 27:17.208
And in a different way.

27:17.708 --> 27:19.583
We all know what Vicky was like.

27:20.417 --> 27:22.875
Your father's death deeply affected her.

27:23.375 --> 27:26.875
And then... she became obsessed
with those things.

27:27.875 --> 27:29.292
She was very lonely.

27:29.458 --> 27:33.625
But I refuse to believe she was evil
and the will is proof of that.

27:33.792 --> 27:35.625
How can you say that?

27:35.792 --> 27:38.292
How can you be so hypocritical?

27:39.000 --> 27:40.875
You knew everything.

27:41.042 --> 27:44.833
You knew about everything she did to us
and you never did anything.

27:45.375 --> 27:48.042
You allowed all that madness.

27:49.208 --> 27:51.125
Don't talk about your mother like that.

27:51.292 --> 27:52.792
She has her reasons to say that.

27:53.792 --> 27:55.458
We all do.

27:55.625 --> 27:56.750
Ask your son.

27:56.917 --> 27:57.958
Shut up!

28:00.125 --> 28:01.917
Don't involve your cousin in this.

28:02.083 --> 28:03.750
He can speak, he has a mouth.

28:04.375 --> 28:06.042
Why don't you ask him?

28:06.875 --> 28:07.875
Why don't you speak?

28:09.042 --> 28:11.917
Why don't you tell your father
what Victoria did to you?

28:12.083 --> 28:13.083
Speak!

28:16.667 --> 28:19.750
I understand you're going through
a rough patch financially.

28:20.208 --> 28:22.958
If the last will of your mother
can help you out,

28:23.125 --> 28:25.375
you should be grateful to her.

28:25.833 --> 28:27.083
Don't you think?

28:27.375 --> 28:28.375
What?

28:31.875 --> 28:32.917
And me?

28:43.708 --> 28:45.500
Sara, Sara!

28:51.583 --> 28:52.708
Sorry.

29:18.208 --> 29:19.542
Is it still hurting you?

29:27.125 --> 29:28.500
I got a call from the port,

29:30.292 --> 29:32.375
they need people to unload fish.

29:32.542 --> 29:35.125
Are you sure
that's what you want to do?

29:37.208 --> 29:39.875
The stink of fish isn't great,
but what can I do?

29:40.542 --> 29:42.625
I can't stay here all day doing nothing.

29:42.792 --> 29:44.625
I'm climbing the walls.

29:45.375 --> 29:48.667
-And we need the money.
-That's true.

29:52.083 --> 29:54.042
Things are changing, my love.

29:54.708 --> 29:58.458
Bit by bit, but they're changing.

29:59.333 --> 30:02.458
Although one thing never changes,
do you know what it is?

30:03.833 --> 30:07.125
You. You're still as hot as you were
the day I met you.

30:08.208 --> 30:09.333
Yeah?

30:10.125 --> 30:11.917
No, more.

31:12.208 --> 31:13.792
Good night, grandma.

31:17.083 --> 31:18.292
Me too.

31:29.542 --> 31:30.750
Here it goes!

31:33.125 --> 31:34.375
Let's go, guys.

31:40.333 --> 31:41.625
Oh, God!

31:49.708 --> 31:50.583
Give it here.

32:02.167 --> 32:05.417
Have you seen the new girl?
What a show-off.

32:05.583 --> 32:08.750
She's stupid, she should never
have come to this school.

32:09.167 --> 32:12.292
You only have to look at her face
to see how stupid she is.

32:19.167 --> 32:20.917
What are you doing here alone?

32:22.375 --> 32:24.375
I saw what you did the other day...

32:25.750 --> 32:27.167
to the cars.

32:31.542 --> 32:33.000
I see you don't have any friends.

32:34.750 --> 32:36.333
Of course I do.

32:37.750 --> 32:39.000
I have to go.

32:51.792 --> 32:53.292
My name's Luna.

33:10.750 --> 33:14.417
I came to make you a soup,
it's always a nice dinner.

33:17.833 --> 33:19.542
I'm sorry about yesterday.

33:22.000 --> 33:26.167
Now that you're back,
the last thing I want is to argue.

33:29.250 --> 33:31.583
It wasn't a good idea to come here.

33:37.917 --> 33:39.083
Listen.

33:41.042 --> 33:42.750
I'm sorry about all this,

33:43.542 --> 33:45.042
but I need you.

33:46.792 --> 33:48.500
I can't carry on alone.

33:50.125 --> 33:51.583
And you're my sister.

33:53.208 --> 33:54.583
I've got no one else, Al.

33:57.333 --> 33:58.667
So,

33:59.375 --> 34:01.292
I don't care if you want
to keep the house.

34:01.458 --> 34:04.417
You can keep it all, I don't mind.

34:07.708 --> 34:09.042
But, please,

34:10.750 --> 34:12.542
please, don't go.

34:14.292 --> 34:15.792
Please, help me.

34:17.208 --> 34:18.958
<i>Mummy!</i>

34:19.208 --> 34:21.000
<i>Mummy! Help me!</i>

34:27.792 --> 34:29.125
Nora!

34:30.333 --> 34:31.208
Nora!

34:34.083 --> 34:35.875
Nora, open the door!

34:36.333 --> 34:37.292
The key!

34:38.000 --> 34:39.083
There is no key.

34:39.250 --> 34:41.250
Mummy!

34:41.417 --> 34:42.958
Mummy!

34:43.125 --> 34:44.083
Step back!

34:46.542 --> 34:47.333
Nora!

34:47.958 --> 34:49.500
Find something to use as a lever!

34:55.417 --> 34:56.500
Nora!

35:04.250 --> 35:05.792
Mummy!

35:06.542 --> 35:08.417
Run!

35:10.000 --> 35:11.125
Nora!

35:32.125 --> 35:33.833
Nora, move away from the door!

35:43.167 --> 35:44.542
Leave me alone!

35:57.458 --> 35:59.667
Nora! Nora! Nora, are you OK?

35:59.833 --> 36:01.875
Nora! Nora, look at me! Nora.

36:02.042 --> 36:03.208
Nora.

36:03.375 --> 36:04.417
Mummy.

36:10.625 --> 36:12.375
What happened here?

36:24.833 --> 36:26.333
She's asleep.

36:28.208 --> 36:29.875
We'll let her rest.

36:46.708 --> 36:47.917
What's that?

36:50.875 --> 36:52.333
It was Mum's.

36:57.833 --> 36:59.958
What's Nora doing with this crap?

37:00.958 --> 37:02.208
Al...

37:03.208 --> 37:05.542
You need to keep a close eye
on the girl.

37:10.167 --> 37:12.208
Perhaps... I don't know, but...

37:13.458 --> 37:16.042
perhaps Mum wants her
to stand in front of the mirror.

37:18.125 --> 37:19.250
What mirror?

37:20.542 --> 37:22.417
Al, the mirror...

37:22.583 --> 37:23.875
Sara, that's enough.

37:24.625 --> 37:26.792
I left to get away
from all that crap.

37:28.417 --> 37:29.667
Do you understand?

37:33.583 --> 37:36.042
Alicia. Alicia.

37:37.208 --> 37:39.708
We can't pretend
that nothing happened.

37:43.625 --> 37:45.333
Don't you remember that night?

37:53.083 --> 37:56.125
That night Fran slept over...

37:57.875 --> 38:00.042
and she took us to that place.

38:22.667 --> 38:24.125
<i>It was the first time.</i>

38:27.875 --> 38:29.333
<i>She told us something.</i>

38:30.542 --> 38:33.458
<i>She wanted us to understand</i>
<i>the meaning of death.</i>

38:45.458 --> 38:46.833
Look closely,

38:48.333 --> 38:51.000
the spider will eat its prey.

38:52.708 --> 38:56.375
The disgusting insect
will cease to exist.

38:57.292 --> 39:00.292
That's death.

39:01.292 --> 39:04.833
But I'm not going to let
anyone devour me...

39:06.875 --> 39:09.125
not until I decide.

39:11.083 --> 39:14.875
And that will never happen.

39:28.125 --> 39:30.375
This is all just an illusion,

39:32.375 --> 39:33.875
like death.

39:36.417 --> 39:37.792
Do you understand?

39:40.042 --> 39:43.083
Open your eyes.
Open your eyes!

39:43.250 --> 39:43.958
No!

39:44.500 --> 39:45.583
Look at yourselves!

39:53.958 --> 39:55.750
<i>You were there too,</i>

39:57.250 --> 39:58.833
with Fran and I.

40:03.750 --> 40:07.375
Sometimes we blank out memories
so we can survive.

40:07.708 --> 40:09.125
It's normal.

40:18.625 --> 40:19.667
Where are you going?

40:21.500 --> 40:22.792
Alicia.

40:23.792 --> 40:26.208
What are you doing? Alicia.

40:26.542 --> 40:28.417
What are you going to do?

40:30.042 --> 40:32.042
Stop a moment, please.

40:39.500 --> 40:41.792
I won't let her hurt my daughter.

40:42.917 --> 40:45.167
Don't move! Sara, Sara!

40:45.333 --> 40:46.917
-Not like that.
-It's for the best.

40:47.083 --> 40:48.875
Not like that. That's a crime.

40:49.208 --> 40:50.583
-Sara, Sara.
-No, no, no, no.

40:50.750 --> 40:53.167
-It's a crime.
-It's for the best! Listen to me!

40:53.750 --> 40:55.667
-Sara...
-What's going on?

40:55.958 --> 40:57.167
No, no, no, Mum...

40:58.833 --> 41:00.292
-Mikel!
-How does it work?

41:01.167 --> 41:03.000
-Mikel!
-How does it work?

41:21.792 --> 41:23.875
I want to leave.

41:42.375 --> 41:44.708
I'm not sure about doing this.

41:45.500 --> 41:46.583
No.

43:39.625 --> 43:41.000
Bloody hell!

43:58.167 --> 43:59.292
Yes?

44:00.042 --> 44:01.167
Hello?

44:30.250 --> 44:31.542
What are you doing here, Nora?

44:34.333 --> 44:35.292
Are you alright?

44:38.042 --> 44:39.250
Doesn't this work?

44:40.458 --> 44:41.833
I'll get some candles.

44:45.083 --> 44:48.667
Let's go up to bed, yeah?
It's very late. Come on.

44:49.792 --> 44:51.458
You've got no shoes on.

44:52.417 --> 44:53.917
I think I've lost something.

44:54.375 --> 44:55.292
What thing?

44:56.250 --> 44:57.917
Something I found.

44:59.417 --> 45:01.208
If you don't tell me what it is...

45:09.500 --> 45:10.833
We'll talk tomorrow.

45:13.250 --> 45:17.208
Promise me that you won't go
in grandma's room again.

45:19.250 --> 45:20.208
Ever.

45:26.250 --> 45:27.500
I love you.

45:29.208 --> 45:30.792
What were you burning?

45:31.583 --> 45:33.042
Loads of old junk.

45:35.167 --> 45:36.500
Grandma's things?

45:37.917 --> 45:40.125
Things that aren't useful
for anything.

45:41.417 --> 45:42.625
Come on, sleep time.

45:43.917 --> 45:45.167
Good night.

46:25.792 --> 46:26.792
Little pig.

46:28.708 --> 46:29.875
Little pig.

46:30.250 --> 46:32.375
Do you know what happened
in the village yesterday?

46:32.542 --> 46:34.000
There was a power outage, right?

46:35.042 --> 46:37.083
Remember the electrician I mentioned?

46:37.875 --> 46:39.250
Mr. Cotarelo.

46:40.542 --> 46:43.875
He electrocuted himself working on
the electrics at the school.

46:44.917 --> 46:46.458
It caused the power outage.

46:46.625 --> 46:48.083
Damn it, poor man.

46:51.250 --> 46:52.958
You burnt everything, didn't you?

46:53.583 --> 46:54.458
Yes.

46:56.292 --> 46:58.917
It's much better without all that junk.

46:59.083 --> 47:00.792
Yeah, I think so too.

47:01.125 --> 47:02.958
Alright, I've finished here.

47:04.000 --> 47:04.917
Hello?

47:05.083 --> 47:07.833
<i>-Hello, I'm calling from the school.</i>
-Is Nora alright?

47:08.000 --> 47:09.708
<i>No, the children have gone</i>
<i>on an excursion today.</i>

47:09.875 --> 47:13.167
<i>-I want to talk to Mikel Fernández.</i>
-That's me.

47:14.375 --> 47:15.708
When do you start?

47:15.875 --> 47:18.958
<i>Well, straight away, today.</i>
<i>It's very urgent...</i>

47:19.125 --> 47:21.250
<i>they're using a generator</i>
<i>to light the school.</i>

47:21.417 --> 47:23.792
<i>It's just a couple of days</i>
<i>and it pays well.</i>

47:27.750 --> 47:31.000
<i>-Did you hear me?</i>
-Yes, I'm listening.

47:32.583 --> 47:35.417
<i>Have you already told the hospital</i>
<i>you're leaving?</i>

47:39.917 --> 47:42.042
-No, not yet.
<i>-Well, wait a while.</i>

47:42.208 --> 47:46.208
<i>As soon as I finish the job,</i>
<i>we'll go. I promise.</i>

47:46.500 --> 47:47.917
<i>I can't say no.</i>

47:48.083 --> 47:50.958
<i>And we need the money.</i>

47:51.667 --> 47:54.000
Yes, yes, I agree. It's fine.

47:55.667 --> 47:58.083
<i>-I love you.</i>
-I love you too.

48:36.625 --> 48:39.417
-Thanks. See you later.
-Thank you. Bye, Pablo.

49:46.250 --> 49:47.750
Open your mouth.

50:40.083 --> 50:41.625
Thanks for returning it to me.

50:45.042 --> 50:46.542
Where did you find it?

50:47.583 --> 50:48.917
I lost it.

50:49.667 --> 50:51.042
Somewhere.

50:52.750 --> 50:56.333
Put it on,
your grandma wants you to wear it.

50:56.500 --> 50:57.917
You know her?

51:03.250 --> 51:06.708
Grandmas always want the best for us.

51:24.583 --> 51:25.833
Sara.

51:27.750 --> 51:29.000
Mikel isn't here?

51:29.917 --> 51:32.750
No, the school asked him
to fix the lighting.

51:32.917 --> 51:33.625
And Nora?

51:34.542 --> 51:36.042
Nora's sleeping.

51:36.750 --> 51:37.917
What's wrong?

51:43.542 --> 51:44.958
It's Mum.

51:46.500 --> 51:49.375
This may seem a little weird, but...

51:50.333 --> 51:52.333
Look at the medallion she was wearing.

52:05.083 --> 52:07.708
<i>I think she used it to control us.</i>

52:08.708 --> 52:11.250
<i>And now she's using it with Nora, I bet.</i>

52:14.417 --> 52:16.750
We have to get rid of the locket.

52:17.792 --> 52:19.375
She keeps it in the drawer.

52:28.458 --> 52:29.542
It's not here.

52:33.125 --> 52:35.042
<i>Victoria doesn't know how to die.</i>

52:36.708 --> 52:38.333
<i>She wants to stay.</i>

52:48.250 --> 52:49.458
Forgive me.

52:51.542 --> 52:55.292
Yes, I've been selfish.

52:57.083 --> 52:59.417
She's never going to forgive us.

53:03.667 --> 53:05.375
She's not going to forgive us.

54:22.833 --> 54:24.792
No matter how much you insist,

54:25.833 --> 54:27.542
you're already dead.

54:49.708 --> 54:50.958
Guys!

54:52.792 --> 54:53.875
It was you.

54:55.042 --> 54:56.375
Leave me alone.

54:58.917 --> 55:01.500
She's a foul-smelling,
conceited swine.

55:01.667 --> 55:03.000
Just like her father.

55:03.167 --> 55:05.458
Have you seen him?
He smells like fish.

55:06.500 --> 55:10.042
You're disgusting, just like
that crazy old bat you live with.

55:12.792 --> 55:13.875
What are you looking at?

55:14.042 --> 55:17.458
I'd much rather be like her
than be like you.

55:17.625 --> 55:20.667
Loser. Freaky bitch.
Who do you think you are?

56:01.875 --> 56:04.750
I'm know they were making fun
of her and her grandmother.

56:06.083 --> 56:08.458
But I wasn't expecting
behaviour like that.

56:10.875 --> 56:12.375
I don't understand.

56:16.417 --> 56:19.458
We're very sorry. It's just...

56:20.833 --> 56:23.000
Nora isn't like that.
She's not like that.

56:23.833 --> 56:25.500
That's what I thought,

56:27.000 --> 56:29.750
but we have to expel her
for a few days.

57:27.792 --> 57:29.000
What's up, sweetie?

57:29.917 --> 57:31.125
I'm bored.

57:32.208 --> 57:35.250
Yeah, but that's part of the punishment.

57:38.750 --> 57:41.042
-Can I go out to the garden?
-No.

57:42.625 --> 57:43.417
OK.

57:44.708 --> 57:45.708
Nora.

57:51.083 --> 57:53.208
Just the garden, alright?

57:54.792 --> 57:55.750
Nora.

59:58.417 --> 59:59.458
Nora.

01:00:00.875 --> 01:00:02.375
What are you doing here?

01:00:06.958 --> 01:00:08.792
Has something happened at home?

01:00:13.333 --> 01:00:14.625
How did you get in?

01:00:15.625 --> 01:00:17.750
The back door was open.

01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:27.500
You're very careless, Sara.

01:00:29.167 --> 01:00:30.750
Are you one of Nora's friends?

01:00:32.833 --> 01:00:34.542
You were always very naive.

01:00:35.875 --> 01:00:38.583
-What?
-You heard me, idiot.

01:00:40.083 --> 01:00:43.208
-Nora, who's that?
-That's Luna, my friend.

01:00:57.417 --> 01:01:00.333
We know where the locket
you're looking for is.

01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:01.583
Where?

01:01:01.958 --> 01:01:03.375
Buried in your garden.

01:01:08.708 --> 01:01:10.042
It's you.

01:01:10.833 --> 01:01:12.042
Right, Mum?

01:01:20.208 --> 01:01:23.000
If I were you,
I'd get a shovel and start digging.

01:01:28.833 --> 01:01:32.500
Alright, sweetie,
you've hidden really well. I give up.

01:01:36.708 --> 01:01:39.042
Come out,
this isn't funny anymore.

01:01:47.708 --> 01:01:50.750
You have to pay for what you did,
you and your sister.

01:01:54.125 --> 01:01:57.083
I'd suggest you carry on,
for your own good.

01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:22.750
Sara!
Nora's escaped, we can't find her!

01:02:22.917 --> 01:02:25.042
Call as soon as you get this, please.

01:02:27.625 --> 01:02:28.917
Nora!

01:02:31.125 --> 01:02:32.792
Nora!

01:02:52.083 --> 01:02:53.833
Are you looking for this, aunt?

01:02:56.417 --> 01:02:58.500
Why are you doing this to me?

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:03.583
Why?

01:03:18.333 --> 01:03:20.083
Nora, help me!

01:03:29.208 --> 01:03:31.750
She's still moving, hit her harder!

01:03:39.167 --> 01:03:40.375
Coward!

01:04:12.292 --> 01:04:13.750
What clothes was she wearing?

01:04:13.917 --> 01:04:17.000
-Her blue school tracksuit.
-Tracksuit...

01:04:17.167 --> 01:04:19.333
-Green T-shirt.
-Blue tracksuit and a green T-shirt.

01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:21.958
OK, thanks. Thank you.

01:04:26.833 --> 01:04:28.250
They'll find her.

01:04:55.875 --> 01:04:59.708
You're ready to complete the link.
Come closer.

01:05:00.833 --> 01:05:03.125
You just have to look into her eyes.

01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:19.125
I'm scared.

01:05:19.958 --> 01:05:21.792
It's too late for that now.

01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:27.292
No one loves you anymore, Nora.
Not even your parents.

01:05:28.917 --> 01:05:32.083
What will they think when they find out
you killed your aunty?

01:05:33.667 --> 01:05:35.917
Is there any sense in life
for you anymore?

01:07:12.208 --> 01:07:14.333
Nora, what are you doing here?

01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:15.958
I'm wiping up sand.

01:07:16.333 --> 01:07:18.833
We looked for you everywhere.
Where were you?

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.833
I was watching the waves.

01:07:25.333 --> 01:07:27.917
My love. My love.

01:07:41.250 --> 01:07:44.708
<i>Hi, this is Sara.</i>
<i>Leave a message after the beep. Thanks.</i>

01:07:45.083 --> 01:07:47.417
<i>Sara!</i>
<i>Nora's escaped, we can't find her!</i>

01:07:47.583 --> 01:07:49.833
<i>Call as soon as you get this, please.</i>

01:08:11.208 --> 01:08:12.542
I found this.

01:08:13.167 --> 01:08:15.000
It has phone numbers written down.

01:08:15.583 --> 01:08:17.082
Maybe someone knows something.

01:08:28.542 --> 01:08:29.375
Go!

01:08:30.457 --> 01:08:32.750
No, she closed the store.

01:08:46.875 --> 01:08:48.707
Nora, what did you do to that dog?

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:50.332
Nothing.

01:08:51.667 --> 01:08:52.750
Nora, I saw you!

01:08:56.832 --> 01:08:58.542
He was destroying the plants.

01:08:59.707 --> 01:09:01.332
There's nothing else here.

01:09:03.167 --> 01:09:04.917
We should go to the police station.

01:09:05.082 --> 01:09:06.042
I'll come with you.

01:09:06.375 --> 01:09:08.167
Yes, are you coming?

01:09:09.250 --> 01:09:10.332
Let's go.

01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:52.417
Anna, come here a moment, please.

01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:55.667
Yes?

01:13:58.250 --> 01:14:00.167
You don't need to stay today.

01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:04.583
I'm not going to the hospital,
I'll care for my mother.

01:14:04.875 --> 01:14:06.167
OK.

01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:08.958
Perfect.
I'll come back tomorrow then.

01:14:09.125 --> 01:14:10.458
Very well.

01:14:10.958 --> 01:14:12.625
-Bye.
-Bye.

01:14:20.917 --> 01:14:22.375
What happened to the nurse?

01:14:23.458 --> 01:14:27.250
She couldn't stay,
she said she had a personal issue.

01:14:28.458 --> 01:14:32.000
I have to buy some gear,
I haven't finished at the school yet.

01:14:32.125 --> 01:14:35.250
I'll stay. I'll call the hospital,
it won't be a problem.

01:14:37.292 --> 01:14:38.208
Are you sure?

01:14:38.917 --> 01:14:40.000
What's wrong?

01:14:42.333 --> 01:14:44.375
Hurry up or you'll be late.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.542
And you, behave yourself.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.417
Come on, sweetie.

01:17:16.750 --> 01:17:17.875
Nora!

01:17:18.792 --> 01:17:21.375
What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be in class?

01:17:21.625 --> 01:17:23.000
It's boring, Mummy.

01:17:23.917 --> 01:17:26.167
Miss Mejido is unbearable.

01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:37.792
Why didn't you disconnect her before?

01:17:38.292 --> 01:17:39.917
Do I have to do everything?

01:17:44.125 --> 01:17:47.125
I don't need this disgusting
sack of bones anymore.

01:17:52.542 --> 01:17:53.625
What are you doing?

01:17:57.208 --> 01:17:58.708
Give me my daughter back!

01:17:58.875 --> 01:18:01.042
-Mummy...
-Give me my daughter back!

01:18:01.125 --> 01:18:02.500
Mummy, no!

01:18:03.083 --> 01:18:04.333
Mummy, no!

01:18:09.125 --> 01:18:11.583
You never loved me, little pig.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.583
What have you done to Nora?

01:18:15.167 --> 01:18:17.708
If you say a word of this to dad,

01:18:18.583 --> 01:18:19.750
I'll kill him.

01:18:36.875 --> 01:18:38.000
Hello.

01:18:41.542 --> 01:18:42.542
Daddy!

01:18:42.708 --> 01:18:43.667
Hello, my love.

01:18:43.833 --> 01:18:45.542
Careful with dad, he's very tired.

01:18:45.708 --> 01:18:46.875
Have you had dinner?

01:18:47.042 --> 01:18:48.167
Let's eat.

01:18:50.917 --> 01:18:52.417
<i>Pass me the salt.</i>

01:18:53.542 --> 01:18:54.667
Thank you.

01:19:04.625 --> 01:19:08.208
I never told you how grandpa died.

01:19:10.083 --> 01:19:11.208
Alicia, darling...

01:19:11.375 --> 01:19:12.917
It's important.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.583
We hadn't seen dad for a long time.

01:19:25.333 --> 01:19:27.042
He'd been travelling.

01:19:31.375 --> 01:19:34.667
Sara and I wanted to play with him,
for him to notice us.

01:20:57.167 --> 01:20:59.750
Sara, where's your sister?

01:21:01.833 --> 01:21:05.417
<i>We got his attention,</i>
<i>so he'd come down to the basement.</i>

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.667
I hid under the stairs...

01:21:11.583 --> 01:21:12.583
to give him...

01:21:13.917 --> 01:21:15.125
a surprise.

01:21:18.583 --> 01:21:19.625
And...

01:21:21.583 --> 01:21:22.917
And he fell.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.583
Victoria always blamed us,

01:21:35.833 --> 01:21:37.208
but we were only playing.

01:21:37.375 --> 01:21:39.000
Liar!

01:21:39.167 --> 01:21:40.083
Nora.

01:21:47.292 --> 01:21:49.500
-Do you think it's normal...
-You don't understand.

01:21:50.792 --> 01:21:53.333
What? Tell me, what?

01:21:56.583 --> 01:21:57.750
I'm going to work.

01:21:58.208 --> 01:22:01.417
Pack our stuff, as soon as I finish
at the school, we'll leave.

01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:03.542
That's what you wanted, right?

01:22:03.708 --> 01:22:06.167
You've got what you wanted.
For fuck's sake!

01:22:53.292 --> 01:22:57.458
I can still feel
the warmth of his hands.

01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:03.583
The most attractive man
I've ever seen in my life.

01:23:06.042 --> 01:23:08.125
Alicia looks a bit like him.

01:23:12.250 --> 01:23:13.792
She has his eyes.

01:23:15.458 --> 01:23:16.917
But not his heart.

01:23:21.875 --> 01:23:23.250
Will you kill her?

01:23:24.417 --> 01:23:27.875
<i>I'd rather let her suffer.</i>

01:23:29.083 --> 01:23:30.333
<i>And him?</i>

01:23:31.250 --> 01:23:32.750
<i>Maybe.</i>

01:23:34.042 --> 01:23:36.875
<i>That way she'll suffer even more.</i>

01:23:38.083 --> 01:23:39.625
<i>Lose everything.</i>

01:23:40.208 --> 01:23:43.167
<i>Everything except</i>
<i>her darling daughter.</i>

01:23:44.542 --> 01:23:48.250
<i>Who she'll have to look at,</i>
<i>knowing that it's no longer her...</i>

01:23:49.292 --> 01:23:52.917
<i>but the thing she hates</i>
<i>and despises the most...</i>

01:24:04.042 --> 01:24:05.667
Ah! Bloody hell!

01:24:09.542 --> 01:24:14.000
Mikel, come home if you hear this.
Mikel, please!

01:24:34.833 --> 01:24:35.792
Nora?

01:26:58.667 --> 01:26:59.708
Alicia?

01:27:02.250 --> 01:27:03.333
Alicia?

01:27:04.625 --> 01:27:05.500
Alicia!

01:27:05.708 --> 01:27:06.500
Nora!

01:27:07.250 --> 01:27:08.208
Nora, where's Mum?

01:27:11.375 --> 01:27:12.375
Nora!

01:27:15.625 --> 01:27:16.708
Where's Mum?

01:27:25.333 --> 01:27:26.375
Alicia?

01:27:29.917 --> 01:27:31.583
Don't move from there, sweetie.

01:27:43.292 --> 01:27:44.167
Alicia?

01:28:00.083 --> 01:28:01.542
Alicia!

01:28:04.875 --> 01:28:06.083
Gotcha!

01:29:16.042 --> 01:29:17.417
Sorry, daddy.

01:29:19.375 --> 01:29:21.125
It was Mum's fault.

01:29:57.792 --> 01:29:59.000
Nora!

01:30:14.375 --> 01:30:16.792
Nora! Nora!

01:30:19.292 --> 01:30:21.625
Nora! Nora!

01:30:21.792 --> 01:30:23.375
Nora, look at me!

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.083
Let her go!

01:31:58.167 --> 01:31:59.458
You want more?

01:32:00.625 --> 01:32:04.417
The best is yet to come. Come here, pig!

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:07.125
No, Mikel!

01:32:07.292 --> 01:32:08.500
Don't kill her!

01:32:10.250 --> 01:32:11.458
Don't kill her! No!

01:32:13.625 --> 01:32:15.042
No, Mikel, no.

01:32:15.208 --> 01:32:16.333
Don't kill her.

01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:17.708
Don't kill her, no.

01:32:18.875 --> 01:32:20.000
No, no, no!

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:13.250
You won't see Nora again
in your whole goddamn life.

01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:17.958
You're going to rot here.

01:34:26.250 --> 01:34:28.208
You're not going to destroy
any more lives.

01:34:54.250 --> 01:34:55.500
My love.

01:35:01.708 --> 01:35:04.667
You have to hold on, do you hear me?

01:35:25.958 --> 01:35:27.375
You have to get better.

01:36:07.625 --> 01:36:10.833
I have to be
what I want to be, grandma.

01:36:13.875 --> 01:36:15.667
You have to go with grandpa.

01:36:17.042 --> 01:36:18.375
He's a good man.

01:36:20.542 --> 01:36:23.583
He says that heaven is like
walking on soft sand.

01:36:25.333 --> 01:36:26.667
You'll be happy there.

01:36:28.333 --> 01:36:31.208
And you can come to see me
whenever you want.

01:36:32.917 --> 01:36:34.167
Like he has.

01:36:36.958 --> 01:36:38.792
You can protect me, grandma.

01:37:00.583 --> 01:37:02.000
Goodbye, grandma.

01:37:27.125 --> 01:37:28.458
Nora, darling.

01:37:28.625 --> 01:37:29.833
Alicia!

01:37:32.375 --> 01:37:34.125
Daddy, mummy.

01:37:36.083 --> 01:37:37.250
What?

01:37:37.417 --> 01:37:39.292
I love you lots.

01:37:40.958 --> 01:37:42.417
Talk to me, talk to me!

01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:44.708
I missed you so much.

01:37:54.750 --> 01:37:57.750
MISSING

01:38:56.958 --> 01:38:59.875
<i>Grandmas always want the best for us.</i>
