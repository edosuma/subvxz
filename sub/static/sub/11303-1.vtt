- No.

- That's right.

Rebecca.

08:19.448 --> 08:23.033
<i>This is the third murder of its
kind that we've had this year.</i>

08:25.370 --> 08:27.871
- You call the FBI?
- Yeah.

08:27.956 --> 08:29.589
I called them after the second one

08:29.708 --> 08:31.091
and they sent some little shit up here

08:31.210 --> 08:32.708
and he looked through our
files and took some notes

08:32.845 --> 08:34.260
and then he ran back to Quantico

08:34.379 --> 08:36.847
<i>as fast as his little $60
loafers could take him.</i>

08:36.932 --> 08:39.683
Told me to call back
if a third body turned up.

08:39.768 --> 08:41.684
So maybe now they'll give a shit.

08:43.472 --> 08:45.388
So what does this
have to do with me?

08:47.025 --> 08:48.942
When was the last time
you saw Rebecca?

08:49.061 --> 08:53.780
I haven't seen anyone...
for about 18 months.

08:53.899 --> 08:55.982

08:56.068 --> 08:59.069
the last coordinates on her car's GPS

08:59.204 --> 09:01.571
brought me up
to your cabin today.

09:03.625 --> 09:06.126
- You didn't see her?
- Nope.

09:06.245 --> 09:08.128
Any idea why she'd come
looking for you?

09:08.247 --> 09:10.247
How the hell she'd even know
you were up there, Hood?

09:10.382 --> 09:11.956
I'm just trying to put this together.

09:11.967 --> 09:13.917
- It's her uncle's land.
- It's what?

09:14.052 --> 09:18.588
- It's her uncle's land.
- You're living on Proctor's land?

09:18.724 --> 09:23.059
- He doesn't know.
- What happened to you, Hood?

09:24.816 --> 09:26.599

09:28.320 --> 09:31.738
We found trace blood
that didn't match Rebecca's.

09:32.941 --> 09:34.991
I'm gonna need you to voluntarily

09:35.110 --> 09:36.826
submit a blood sample
so we can rule you out.

09:36.945 --> 09:38.828
You think I'm a fucking
serial killer now?

09:38.947 --> 09:40.447
Have you seen yourself lately, Hood?

09:40.532 --> 09:42.832
You're living up in the woods.
You look like the Unabomber.

09:42.951 --> 09:45.668
- Yes, you can have my blood.
- Oh, and, Hood...

09:49.958 --> 09:53.460
if there's anything else you
want to tell me, now's the time.

09:53.545 --> 09:55.512
You should be looking at Proctor.

09:55.630 --> 10:00.467
Yeah, well, these days that's a
little more complicated. He's...

10:00.552 --> 10:02.435
[knocks]
Yeah?

10:02.521 --> 10:04.971

Listen, I'll have Deputy Cruz
come up and take your blood

10:14.066 --> 10:16.282

10:17.736 --> 10:19.786

11:59.921 --> 12:04.090
She was murdered. And while the
police can't say for certain,

12:04.176 --> 12:06.926
there are definitely
similarities between this case

12:07.012 --> 12:09.262

42:21.364 --> 42:24.313
Yeah, go ahead.
Go ahead, shoot my other knee.

42:24.398 --> 42:27.399
Go ahead. You know that it
won't change what I'm saying.

42:27.485 --> 42:29.401
I have no idea
where they took him.

42:29.487 --> 42:33.372
No, but you can find him.
Black sites, ghost detention centers.

42:33.457 --> 42:34.873
You have access to those files.

42:34.959 --> 42:37.326
Not anymore. After the
congressional hearings,

42:37.411 --> 42:40.329
they closed the loop
and I'm not in it.

42:40.414 --> 42:42.247
Bullshit.
You are the fucking loop.

42:42.283 --> 42:45.050
I was.
That was 20 years ago.

42:45.136 --> 42:46.886
Things change.

42:47.021 --> 42:49.054
<i>Why are we even having
this conversation?</i>

42:49.140 --> 42:54.109
- You know that Job is already dead.
- No, he has intelligence.

42:54.228 --> 42:58.531
- He's a valuable asset.
- His intelligence was 20 years old.

42:58.616 --> 43:00.950
He was a fucking trophy grab.

43:01.068 --> 43:05.204
- He was a head on somebody's wall.
- Whose wall?

43:05.289 --> 43:07.990
<i>Doesn't matter.</i>

43:08.075 --> 43:09.992
The man's dead.

43:10.077 --> 43:14.616
<i>You know it and I know it.
[helicopter blades whirring]</i>

43:16.500 --> 43:20.135
We got to go.
We got to go now!

43:22.223 --> 43:25.680
I guess I'm still in certain loops.

44:14.141 --> 44:17.309
<i>[music playing]</i>

44:27.738 --> 44:30.656
Did he come to see you?

44:31.876 --> 44:34.043
Yes.

44:34.161 --> 44:37.329
But he's not the man
that left that night.

44:37.465 --> 44:41.133
- Not anymore.
- Well, did he say where he's been?

44:41.218 --> 44:44.169
- No.
- Did he say anything?

44:46.641 --> 44:49.058
You thought he might
have a lead on Job?

44:51.228 --> 44:53.929
Look, the day he left,

44:54.015 --> 44:57.316
that was the day you needed
to stop looking to him

44:57.401 --> 44:59.685
for any answers.

45:03.441 --> 45:06.158
You think Job's still alive?

45:09.030 --> 45:13.449
I don't know.
Sometimes I hope he isn't.

45:13.534 --> 45:17.336
- Why?
- Because if he is,

45:17.421 --> 45:22.207
it makes us even bigger
assholes than we already are.

45:22.208 --> 45:25.761
[music]

45:37.074 --> 45:41.377
- So you got nothing.
- Nothing.

45:41.462 --> 45:43.629
Either he didn't know
or he wouldn't say.

45:45.049 --> 45:48.417
- He didn't know.
- I guess we'll never know now.

45:48.502 --> 45:52.972
- Did you really have to kill him?
- He didn't know.

45:53.090 --> 45:57.059
Okay.
What's our next play?

45:57.144 --> 45:58.978
We don't have one.

46:03.684 --> 46:05.684
It's over.

46:05.770 --> 46:09.655
No.
We don't just give up.

46:09.774 --> 46:13.742
- We have no choice.
- So what?

46:15.997 --> 46:18.864
- You're done?
- We got nothing.

46:18.950 --> 46:22.167
- So we find something.
- We've got nothing!

46:30.177 --> 46:34.630
- I can't just leave him for dead.
- Do you think I want to?!

46:38.135 --> 46:40.519
Don't you think I'd do anything?

46:47.395 --> 46:49.194
Dalton was right.

46:51.148 --> 46:52.698
<i>He was right.</i>

46:52.817 --> 46:56.151
Job was dead from the
moment he handed him over.

46:59.824 --> 47:03.492
- Where the hell are you going?
- He's dead.

47:11.519 --> 47:13.864
[music stops]

47:25.349 --> 47:27.516
Anybody home?

47:34.275 --> 47:36.742
Hello?

<i>Daddy!
[laughs]</i>

47:40.281 --> 47:42.247
What's up, little man?

47:42.366 --> 47:43.749
- Where's your mommy?
- Upstairs.

47:43.868 --> 47:46.535
Yeah?
Babe, I'm home.

47:46.620 --> 47:47.786
<i>Maggie: Coming.</i>

47:47.872 --> 47:49.371
Whew.
God, you got bigger.

47:49.457 --> 47:50.923
What do you weigh,
like 1,000 pounds?

47:51.042 --> 47:52.708
- No.
- What, are you, like 10 feet tall?

47:52.793 --> 47:55.210
- No.
- Okay, maybe tomorrow.

47:56.097 --> 47:59.932
- Hi.
- Hi. You're home early.

48:01.552 --> 48:03.686
<i>Yeah, we finished
the triquarterlies today.</i>

48:03.771 --> 48:06.689

Hmm.

48:15.032 --> 48:17.116
- You want to go shoot some hoops?
- Yeah.

48:17.234 --> 48:18.701
Yeah? Maybe we'll go play

48:18.702 --> 48:20.903
and Mommy will let us
know when dinner's ready?

48:22.740 --> 48:24.623

48:24.742 --> 48:26.575

- I will.</i>

shithole called Snake Eyes.
