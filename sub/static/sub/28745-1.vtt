01:40.259 --> 01:41.526
Mr. Price.

01:43.826 --> 01:45.260
Mrs. Foyster.

01:47.293 --> 01:49.260
Well, not for long.

01:50.061 --> 01:51.126
The reverend?

01:53.559 --> 01:56.424
He's very poorly,
confined to his room.

01:56.426 --> 01:58.191
I'm sorry to hear this.

01:58.193 --> 01:59.624
I must visit.

01:59.626 --> 02:00.758
Please.

02:00.760 --> 02:02.124
He would like that.

02:02.126 --> 02:04.660
I must say I am
surprised to see you back here.

02:05.794 --> 02:07.325
You believed me?

02:07.327 --> 02:09.124
You believed everything
that happened here?

02:09.126 --> 02:10.491
Because it is something
that will live

02:10.493 --> 02:12.393
with me for the rest of my life.

02:13.361 --> 02:16.025
Without doubt
what happened here

02:16.027 --> 02:17.860
is beyond the realms of sanity.

02:19.062 --> 02:22.794
Before this case I did not
believe in the paranormal.

02:23.861 --> 02:27.491
I could see through people,
through their games,

02:27.493 --> 02:28.795
I debunked them all.

02:29.995 --> 02:34.661
The Borley Rectory changed
my perspective completely.

02:40.461 --> 02:43.394
She's still here,
you know, waiting.

02:44.428 --> 02:46.327
I can sense her presence.

02:46.329 --> 02:48.329
I can sense her too,

02:49.262 --> 02:52.492
but the rectory it's
scheduled for demolition

02:52.494 --> 02:55.128
and I feel that
with its destruction

02:55.929 --> 02:57.695
her secret will disappear also.

03:01.195 --> 03:03.162
It wasn't just her.

03:06.128 --> 03:09.627
Something else happened,
something you don't know about,

03:09.629 --> 03:11.727
someone I didn't tell you about.

03:11.729 --> 03:13.827
But I thought you
told me everything?

03:13.829 --> 03:14.862
This was different.

03:15.762 --> 03:18.227
I'm not sure if he
was real or not.

03:18.229 --> 03:20.227
He didn't seem
associated with her.

03:20.229 --> 03:22.227
Wait, a male presence?

03:22.229 --> 03:24.596
Yes, but he seemed so real.

03:29.730 --> 03:31.327
I'm sorry I cannot
tell you the story.

03:31.329 --> 03:34.462
Wait, Mrs. Foyster,
you must tell me.

03:36.129 --> 03:37.028
Marianne.

03:40.030 --> 03:43.229
You don't realise what Borley
Rectory has done to me.

03:44.064 --> 03:45.861
It almost killed me.

03:45.863 --> 03:46.863
It has weakened me.

03:48.097 --> 03:49.797
I don't have long myself.

03:50.863 --> 03:52.630
I must know the story.

03:56.097 --> 03:57.929
In between the madness.

03:57.931 --> 04:01.330
In between the light
and darkness I saw him.

04:02.731 --> 04:03.631
Who was he?

04:06.130 --> 04:07.464
It was 10 years ago.

04:08.531 --> 04:12.531
At first it was just glimpses
in the corner of my eye.

04:14.231 --> 04:16.262
Do you believe the
energy of a place

04:16.264 --> 04:18.995
can transfer to another
location, object,

04:18.998 --> 04:21.197
or even another time?

04:22.531 --> 04:24.930
What you're saying is too
fantastic to comprehend,

04:24.932 --> 04:29.462
but yes I believe that
the energy from a location

04:29.464 --> 04:34.096
can affix itself to an
object or indeed a person.

04:34.098 --> 04:35.865
He has always been here.

04:37.465 --> 04:39.264
He visited me a few times.

04:40.432 --> 04:44.066
I'd reach out and there he
was right in front of me

04:44.899 --> 04:46.432
and then gone in a whisper.

04:48.231 --> 04:50.229
It stopped nearly 10 years ago.

04:50.231 --> 04:51.498
He never returned.

04:52.765 --> 04:54.799
Why have you not
told anyone this?

04:58.833 --> 05:02.532
Mr. Price do you believe
in love at first sight?

05:03.498 --> 05:05.733
Why, in certain circumstances,

05:06.866 --> 05:11.296
but real life is not some
whimsical love story.

05:11.298 --> 05:13.196
You wonder why
I'm here right now?

05:13.198 --> 05:14.965
Why I've come back?

05:14.967 --> 05:16.065
Why yes.

05:16.067 --> 05:18.299
Because I sensed he was back.

05:19.199 --> 05:21.733
I was hoping to see
him one more time

05:22.700 --> 05:25.566
even if that last
time was a goodbye.

07:56.705 --> 07:59.036
You must be
Lieutenant O'Neill.

07:59.038 --> 08:00.336
I am.

08:00.338 --> 08:01.870
- Are you Mr. Gibson?
- I am Edward,

08:01.872 --> 08:04.538
Edward Gibson, the
gamekeeper around here.

08:05.571 --> 08:07.870
- You own the land?
- Heavens, no.

08:07.872 --> 08:11.004
For now the land is
effectively untended.

08:11.006 --> 08:14.737
It was requisitioned
by the army in 1940.

08:14.739 --> 08:17.739
It's being used for
training and such.

08:18.439 --> 08:19.505
I see.

08:20.539 --> 08:22.839
The cottage is further
up the path here.

08:23.739 --> 08:26.670
If you like we can
go up together.

08:26.672 --> 08:27.539
Sure.

08:34.539 --> 08:36.539
It's really
something isn't it?

08:37.773 --> 08:39.403
Quite wonderful.

08:39.405 --> 08:41.135
After the home office
requisitioned the land

08:41.138 --> 08:45.037
we rather thought it would
be used for refugees.

08:45.039 --> 08:46.938
- You did?
- Yes.

08:46.940 --> 08:49.707
Well, we didn't exactly
expect it to be used for,

08:50.840 --> 08:54.271
well, I don't actually know
what it is being used for.

08:54.273 --> 08:56.104
That's
because it's classified.

08:56.106 --> 08:57.340
Classified.

08:58.074 --> 08:59.237
Oh I see.

08:59.239 --> 09:01.671
Walls have ears and all that.

09:01.673 --> 09:05.338
Well, it's got warm running
water as well as coal.

09:05.340 --> 09:08.271
It gets a trifle cold
in the winter months

09:08.273 --> 09:09.741
if you're here then.

09:10.808 --> 09:11.674
I don't know.

09:14.173 --> 09:15.939
My son, he helped to renovate

09:15.941 --> 09:18.706
the cottage some
time before the war.

09:18.708 --> 09:21.441
The plan was for him to
move in with his wife.

09:22.574 --> 09:25.307
Well, I'm sure he'll get it
back when all this is over.

09:27.374 --> 09:30.507
Sadly he lost his
life in Dunkirk.

09:32.708 --> 09:33.907
I'm sorry.

09:33.909 --> 09:35.138
It's fine.

09:35.140 --> 09:36.707
You wasn't to know.

09:36.709 --> 09:38.507
King and country and all that.

09:39.842 --> 09:42.709
It seems like I'm not the
only in the dark then?

09:46.240 --> 09:47.675
Is there a key?

09:58.108 --> 10:00.373
I can have a girl
deliver goods to your door

10:00.375 --> 10:05.007
everyday if you wish,
including the papers.

10:05.009 --> 10:05.843
Sure.

10:07.042 --> 10:09.942
My cottage is two miles
further south on the road.

10:10.843 --> 10:14.175
If you get stuck you can
always pay me a visit

10:15.108 --> 10:16.610
and I can see what
I can do here.

10:17.643 --> 10:18.543
Thank you.

10:22.476 --> 10:25.810
Your leg, it still
gives you trouble?

10:26.543 --> 10:28.276
Yes, I expect it would.

10:29.142 --> 10:30.977
I took some shrapnel
in the side.

10:32.142 --> 10:35.811
Some wounds have a habit
of lingering, don't they?

10:38.309 --> 10:39.642
I'm curious why you didn't

10:39.644 --> 10:41.441
get posted back to
the United States?

10:41.443 --> 10:43.242
Thank you, really.

10:45.309 --> 10:46.908
Of course.

10:46.910 --> 10:48.709
Would you like me to walk
you back down the path?

10:48.711 --> 10:49.577
No thank you.

10:50.344 --> 10:51.611
Have a nice day.

17:28.323 --> 17:29.954
Is that
the full transmission?

17:29.956 --> 17:31.089
Over.

17:31.091 --> 17:32.290
It is, over.

17:33.890 --> 17:36.221
Any
idea of cypher or code?

17:36.223 --> 17:37.554
Or do you believe
it's just chatter?

17:37.556 --> 17:38.423
Over.

17:39.489 --> 17:40.989
Could just be chatter.

17:40.991 --> 17:42.254
I'll spend some more time on it.

17:42.256 --> 17:43.288
See if they keep talking.

17:43.290 --> 17:44.390
Over.

17:45.323 --> 17:46.421
Okay, good work.

17:46.423 --> 17:48.323
Over, over and out.

19:36.493 --> 19:37.959
We'll be west out
48, coordinate 17 niner.

19:37.961 --> 19:41.828
322, my position 323,
481, well just, over.

19:56.461 --> 19:59.525
Those who
cling to worthless idols

19:59.527 --> 20:02.525
turn away from
God's love for them,

20:02.527 --> 20:06.392
but I with shouts
of graceful praise

20:06.394 --> 20:08.392
will sacrifice to you.

20:08.394 --> 20:11.793
What I have vowed
I will make good.

20:11.795 --> 20:15.528
I will say salvation
comes from the Lord.

21:09.663 --> 21:11.427
- Jesus.
- Sorry, I,

21:11.429 --> 21:13.561
sorry, I didn't
mean to scare you.

21:13.563 --> 21:14.962
No, that's all right.

21:14.964 --> 21:17.597
Mr. Gibson said I should
be expecting a visitor.

21:20.764 --> 21:22.130
- For me?
- Mm-hm.

21:25.731 --> 21:27.364
There's quite a lot here.

21:28.230 --> 21:30.063
I don't need all this.

21:30.065 --> 21:32.795
They said
they'd paid for and...

21:32.797 --> 21:33.797
You do speak then.

21:35.731 --> 21:38.729
Here, I'll take these,
but I don't need the rest.

21:38.731 --> 21:39.796
Are you sure?

21:39.798 --> 21:40.662
Yeah.

21:40.664 --> 21:42.462
You're all on rations here.

21:42.464 --> 21:44.129
What would I look
like living like this?

21:44.131 --> 21:45.932
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

21:47.065 --> 21:50.063
Mr. Gibson asked if
you'd like more tomorrow?

21:50.065 --> 21:51.431
Maybe every other day.

21:55.965 --> 21:57.331
- You okay?
- Yes.

21:58.999 --> 22:00.098
Just very tired, sir.

22:00.100 --> 22:02.329
Oh, please don't, Robert.

22:02.331 --> 22:03.429
I'm called Robert.

22:03.431 --> 22:04.830
Oh.

22:04.832 --> 22:05.732
Laura.

22:07.231 --> 22:08.363
That's a firm handshake.

22:08.365 --> 22:09.598
It's the war.

22:11.198 --> 22:13.396
I didn't realise
you'd be American.

22:13.398 --> 22:15.465
Well, we've gotta
go somewhere you know?

22:18.966 --> 22:19.833
I should go.

22:33.034 --> 22:34.564
Do you
think it's just chatter?

22:34.566 --> 22:36.163
- Over.
- I'm sure.

22:36.165 --> 22:37.232
Over.

22:38.934 --> 22:40.197
C.O. states that you

22:40.199 --> 22:41.999
must be absolutely certain.

22:42.001 --> 22:42.865
Over.

22:42.867 --> 22:43.965
I am certain.

22:43.967 --> 22:44.834
Over.

22:46.067 --> 22:48.464
Okay, still
continue to find patterns.

22:48.466 --> 22:50.232
Over, over and out.

22:55.667 --> 22:59.567
Those who
cling to worthless idols

23:01.166 --> 23:04.266
turn away from
God's love for them,

23:05.300 --> 23:08.500
but I with shouts
of graceful praise

23:10.367 --> 23:13.033
will sacrifice it to you.

25:50.438 --> 25:51.771
Mr. Gibson.

25:51.773 --> 25:54.070
How are you
finding it old boy?

25:54.072 --> 25:55.773
It's fine, perfect.

25:57.906 --> 25:59.904
I'm on my way
into the village.

25:59.906 --> 26:02.738
Wondered if there was anything
you wanted me to collect?

26:02.740 --> 26:04.704
No, I'm fine,
thank you though.

26:04.706 --> 26:05.573
Of course.

26:07.506 --> 26:09.773
- Is that all?
- Yes.

26:14.473 --> 26:16.473
- Mr. Gibson.
- Yes?

26:17.573 --> 26:21.938
The girl, Laura, she seemed
spooked by coming here.

26:21.940 --> 26:22.807
Oh.

26:24.239 --> 26:25.774
- I see.
- You do?

26:29.073 --> 26:29.973
Is it a bother?

26:30.907 --> 26:33.273
No, it's
no bother, it's just...

26:34.440 --> 26:39.474
This area has something
of a reputation you see.

26:40.842 --> 26:42.207
A reputation?

26:43.574 --> 26:44.742
Yes.

26:47.240 --> 26:48.740
It's all a little embarrassing

26:48.742 --> 26:51.539
and I would rather
not indulge it.

26:51.541 --> 26:55.640
If it is a problem I can
discuss it with Laura.

26:55.642 --> 26:57.473
I wouldn't
Laura to get into trouble.

26:57.475 --> 26:59.341
I can assure you she won't be.

27:00.608 --> 27:03.239
- Just a firm word.
- No, no, she's fine.

27:03.241 --> 27:04.306
Everything's fine.

27:04.308 --> 27:05.907
It's just, I'm just curious.

27:07.341 --> 27:09.206
Have you explored the area?

27:09.208 --> 27:10.473
I have.

27:10.475 --> 27:11.973
The ruins, right?

27:11.975 --> 27:15.073
Is that what it is
or was it a church?

27:15.075 --> 27:17.406
A rectory in fact, dear boy.

27:17.408 --> 27:18.809
- A rectory?
- Yes.

27:19.643 --> 27:21.641
Is there a story there?

27:21.643 --> 27:25.407
Just perhaps stay
away from there.

27:25.409 --> 27:26.709
What happened to it?

27:28.809 --> 27:29.676
Very well.

27:32.509 --> 27:37.643
It burned down in
1939 before the war.

27:38.376 --> 27:40.273
- Burned down?
- Yes.

27:40.275 --> 27:42.307
Now that is all I
am happy to answer.

27:42.309 --> 27:43.707
And why is that?

27:43.709 --> 27:46.476
Because I don't like
indulging fantasy.

27:49.710 --> 27:52.941
I must admit I do
find that Americans

27:52.943 --> 27:56.907
can be a little eccentric.

27:56.909 --> 27:58.274
Thanks.

27:58.276 --> 27:59.941
But if you really want
to know what the fuss

27:59.943 --> 28:03.410
is all about then I would
suggest speaking with Laura.

28:04.276 --> 28:05.443
And ask her what?

28:07.943 --> 28:10.410
Why she finds
the place so scary.

28:14.210 --> 28:16.143
Have a nice morning.

28:53.177 --> 28:57.309
Now I'm thinking this...

30:33.115 --> 30:34.649
What are you...

30:38.615 --> 30:40.448
I put the stuff away for you.

30:52.482 --> 30:54.647
I'm sorry I scared you.

30:54.649 --> 30:57.449
- It was fine.
- No, it isn't.

31:02.349 --> 31:05.516
My dad, he was like that.

31:07.149 --> 31:08.249
Nightmares?

31:11.549 --> 31:15.516
He would try and stay awake
for as long as possible.

31:18.050 --> 31:21.316
He reached the point where he
was too terrified to sleep.

31:22.416 --> 31:23.816
Too terrified to sleep.

31:25.650 --> 31:28.280
At least I haven't
got to that point yet.

31:28.282 --> 31:29.382
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

31:29.384 --> 31:31.384
No, please, it's fine.

31:35.484 --> 31:37.015
I'm sorry I woke you.

31:37.017 --> 31:38.183
I was just...

31:39.183 --> 31:40.250
I don't know.

31:49.616 --> 31:51.517
What's that radio equipment for?

31:55.250 --> 31:56.384
I can't tell you.

31:57.051 --> 31:57.917
Really?

31:58.851 --> 32:01.782
There's pads in there
written in German.

32:01.784 --> 32:02.684
What are you?

32:04.418 --> 32:06.351
- You think I'm a spy?
- No.

32:07.451 --> 32:08.749
If you were I don't know what

32:08.751 --> 32:10.284
you'd want to spy
on around here.

32:15.151 --> 32:16.649
It's a listening post.

32:16.651 --> 32:19.349
We can pick up on German
transmissions here.

32:19.351 --> 32:21.050
Like military?

32:21.052 --> 32:21.885
Maybe.

32:22.685 --> 32:24.449
Most the time it's just chatter,

32:24.451 --> 32:26.816
other times it's
music or comedy.

32:26.818 --> 32:29.316
- Comedy, really?
- Mm-hm.

32:29.318 --> 32:30.685
Germans have comedy too.

32:40.020 --> 32:41.519
Can I ask about your leg?

32:44.120 --> 32:45.217
Anzio

32:45.219 --> 32:46.718
Got it in Anzio.

32:51.086 --> 32:53.753
My fiance, he's in Burma.

32:57.520 --> 32:58.886
I haven't heard from
him in two months now.

33:01.853 --> 33:04.051
Anyway I should go.

33:08.619 --> 33:09.487
Wait.

33:13.453 --> 33:15.353
Why don't you like this cottage?

33:16.153 --> 33:17.385
You'll think me silly.

33:17.387 --> 33:18.684
No, no.

33:18.686 --> 33:19.552
The look in your
face, that's fear.

33:20.654 --> 33:23.218
What have you got to be so
scared about a place like this?

33:23.220 --> 33:25.085
Nothing.

33:25.087 --> 33:26.351
What is it?

33:26.353 --> 33:28.421
It's really nothing.

33:30.654 --> 33:33.388
It's the rectory
right, the nun?

33:35.654 --> 33:37.352
Jesus Christ you're
shaking like a leaf.

33:37.354 --> 33:38.421
What is it?

33:40.254 --> 33:41.852
Laura please.

33:41.854 --> 33:45.152
Please, sir, don't go
digging around in the past.

33:45.154 --> 33:46.654
No good will come of it.

35:57.992 --> 35:59.458
There you are.

36:52.626 --> 36:55.859
You look as if you've
hardly slept a wink.

36:55.861 --> 36:56.861
I haven't.

36:59.326 --> 37:01.927
You saw something didn't you?

37:03.227 --> 37:04.360
Have you?

37:06.261 --> 37:07.594
Laura, please.

37:10.894 --> 37:11.794
Yes.

37:14.861 --> 37:16.527
What did you see?

37:18.095 --> 37:20.258
I must leave this here and go.

37:20.260 --> 37:21.693
It's the cottage, right?

37:21.695 --> 37:24.226
You're terrified of this place.

37:24.228 --> 37:26.527
The fear in your eyes is,

37:27.662 --> 37:32.192
well, I haven't seen fear like
that since I was over there.

37:32.194 --> 37:33.893
I have to go.

37:33.895 --> 37:35.393
"Those who cling
to worthless idols

37:35.395 --> 37:37.326
"turn away from
God's love for them,

37:37.328 --> 37:38.593
"but I with shrouds
of graceful praise

37:38.595 --> 37:40.693
"will sacrifice onto you.

37:40.695 --> 37:42.660
"What I have vowed
I will make good.

37:42.662 --> 37:46.195
"I will say salvation
comes from the Lord."

37:47.929 --> 37:50.559
You've heard those
words as well, right?

37:50.561 --> 37:53.395
That prayer, you've
heard them as well?

37:54.796 --> 37:55.961
Okay.

37:55.963 --> 37:58.328
Okay, and you've seen
her too, right, the nun?

38:00.195 --> 38:01.195
Yes.

38:02.562 --> 38:05.927
Then tell me about
it, all of it, please.

38:09.729 --> 38:10.596
Thank you.

38:32.897 --> 38:34.363
It was before the war.

38:36.630 --> 38:40.862
Mr. Gibson's son, he was
looking after the house,

38:40.864 --> 38:42.463
wanted to build a...

38:44.032 --> 38:47.630
Anyway, look maybe I should go.

38:48.330 --> 38:49.397
Please.

38:55.665 --> 38:59.263
He was away for a while tending
to the lambs or something.

39:00.296 --> 39:01.363
And?

39:03.798 --> 39:08.398
I heard her, the
whispering, the praying.

39:11.065 --> 39:12.464
And then I could see her.

39:14.033 --> 39:18.731
She was standing in the doorway,
her back to me, praying.

39:20.698 --> 39:22.832
As quick as I saw
her she was gone.

39:23.966 --> 39:24.832
Gone?

39:25.531 --> 39:26.496
I was white as a sheet.

39:26.498 --> 39:28.697
I pleaded with Gibson.

39:28.699 --> 39:33.866
I thought that it was
like an omen, a bad omen.

39:34.465 --> 39:35.197
What do you mean?

39:37.164 --> 39:40.897
My grandmother, she was,

39:40.899 --> 39:42.532
she was superstitious.

39:43.532 --> 39:45.897
She believed in whatever this is

39:45.899 --> 39:47.697
and she always
said that whenever

39:47.699 --> 39:51.532
anything like this
appeared it was like...

39:52.432 --> 39:54.731
Like something bad
was gonna happen?

39:54.733 --> 39:55.765
Yeah.

39:55.767 --> 39:56.667
And did it?

39:57.566 --> 39:59.700
We went to war didn't we?

40:02.034 --> 40:04.931
Laura, I'm not gonna
lie, I did see something,

40:04.933 --> 40:07.931
but we went to war for a
lot of different reasons.

40:07.933 --> 40:09.331
Are you telling me
that she's the reason

40:09.333 --> 40:10.698
why Germany invaded Poland

40:10.700 --> 40:12.798
or why there was Pearl Harbor?

40:12.800 --> 40:14.233
No, it's just,

40:19.166 --> 40:21.166
it's like it's drawn to misery.

40:23.934 --> 40:26.901
Look, you wanted to know
what I saw and I told you.

40:28.968 --> 40:30.331
I'm sorry.

40:30.333 --> 40:31.400
For what?

40:32.333 --> 40:34.601
I don't know, making
you feel uncomfortable.

40:38.634 --> 40:43.868
Look, this cottage,
the area, all of it,

40:45.300 --> 40:47.365
it has a history.

40:47.367 --> 40:48.434
History?

40:49.969 --> 40:50.802
Yes.

40:54.634 --> 40:56.702
That wasn't the
first time I saw her.

40:58.101 --> 40:59.267
There was another?

41:03.035 --> 41:07.368
Borley Rectory, it was
a house, a grand house.

41:08.301 --> 41:10.800
The villagers served
those that lived there,

41:10.802 --> 41:12.168
my mom included.

41:14.168 --> 41:17.468
There was a fire, a huge fire.

41:19.635 --> 41:21.100
And it burned down.

41:22.435 --> 41:24.235
I was there, with
the Granvilles,

41:25.301 --> 41:29.233
inside the fire started
and we all got out.

41:29.235 --> 41:32.268
My mom made sure I was out
and safe on the grounds.

41:35.201 --> 41:37.000
My mom left me with the nanny

41:37.002 --> 41:39.836
while she went to help the
others put the fire out.

41:40.736 --> 41:43.569
Everyone was so focused
on the fire they...

41:47.003 --> 41:48.236
She was in the window.

41:49.536 --> 41:51.068
The nun?

41:51.070 --> 41:56.202
Watching, calm, like serene.

41:56.971 --> 41:58.503
Just watching it all burn.

42:01.771 --> 42:02.837
Then she saw me.

42:04.437 --> 42:05.537
What did she do?

42:07.437 --> 42:08.737
She did this.

42:10.671 --> 42:12.035
Shh.

42:12.037 --> 42:13.535
What?

42:13.537 --> 42:15.871
It was like her warning
to not say anything

42:16.971 --> 42:20.036
and now I have, and now
something will happen to me.

42:20.038 --> 42:21.069
- Laura...
- No.

42:21.071 --> 42:22.838
I should go, I should go.

42:29.571 --> 42:36.772
I shouldn't have, but I gathered
as much stuff as I could

42:38.038 --> 42:40.838
about the area, the
things that happened.

42:42.004 --> 42:43.202
Books and stuff.

42:43.204 --> 42:44.405
And you kept them?

42:45.872 --> 42:48.304
I'd very much like
to read those books.

45:28.711 --> 45:32.711
So this is how they do things
in the United States is it?

45:33.511 --> 45:35.410
No, no of course not, sir.

45:37.377 --> 45:38.808
I'll be outside.

45:38.810 --> 45:40.644
You have 10 minutes to
have yourself ready.

45:53.078 --> 45:53.944
Sir.

45:55.145 --> 45:58.344
Ah, now you're befitting
an officer of the uniform.

45:59.411 --> 46:01.842
I wasn't expecting
a visitor, sir.

46:01.844 --> 46:04.143
Should I have waited
for an invitation?

46:04.145 --> 46:05.208
No.

46:05.210 --> 46:06.377
Of course not, sir.

46:07.744 --> 46:09.476
When your superiors
transferred you

46:09.478 --> 46:11.143
to the Allied
communications unit

46:11.145 --> 46:14.078
they assured me that you were
the best man for the job.

46:15.245 --> 46:17.976
Based on what you've achieved
so far I'm inclined to agree,

46:17.978 --> 46:21.209
however I'm also
mindful of the fact

46:21.211 --> 46:24.412
that they made no qualms
about you being transferred.

46:29.646 --> 46:32.579
Things like that give me pause.

46:34.712 --> 46:37.278
As indeed does a faint
smell of alcohol.

46:39.912 --> 46:42.777
No, no, no, don't
worry, we're at war.

46:42.779 --> 46:45.511
A chap may do anything
to steady his nerves.

46:45.513 --> 46:49.011
The question is do
you take it too far?

46:49.013 --> 46:51.710
It's just to steady
the nerves, sir.

46:51.712 --> 46:52.613
Right.

46:53.446 --> 46:54.745
That's my guarantee.

46:55.745 --> 46:56.646
Guarantee?

46:58.147 --> 46:59.711
We're at war, boy.

46:59.713 --> 47:02.513
In war there are no guarantees.

47:03.547 --> 47:05.177
There are several
listening posts like yours.

47:05.179 --> 47:07.277
Their positions up and down
the countryside of Britain

47:07.279 --> 47:08.645
allow the best possible chance

47:08.647 --> 47:10.944
of intercepting
German transmissions.

47:10.946 --> 47:13.811
Your work here is
important, vital.

47:13.813 --> 47:14.680
I see.

47:16.280 --> 47:17.944
It was your
expertise in languages

47:17.946 --> 47:20.979
that made you the
best man for the job.

47:20.981 --> 47:21.880
Thank you, sir.

47:23.514 --> 47:25.814
What was your
background before the war?

47:29.213 --> 47:30.245
Science.

47:30.247 --> 47:32.146
Science and languages.

47:32.148 --> 47:33.213
Right.

47:34.681 --> 47:37.681
Well, you've another five
months out here, that's all.

47:39.381 --> 47:40.779
It would help to know what

47:40.781 --> 47:42.379
I was listening for
in particular, sir.

47:42.381 --> 47:43.879
Listening for?

47:43.881 --> 47:45.979
Well, you listen,
send us the codes.

47:45.981 --> 47:47.679
We interpret them.

47:47.681 --> 47:50.779
And that is a strictly need
to know basis only, old chap.

47:50.781 --> 47:51.681
Right.

47:54.381 --> 47:56.281
Planning something
big aren't we?

47:58.248 --> 47:59.913
Well, I best be off, old chap.

47:59.915 --> 48:01.279
Keep up the good work

48:01.281 --> 48:03.346
and remember to report
anything and everything.

48:03.348 --> 48:04.948
- Understood?
- Sir.

48:07.915 --> 48:09.613
Razor six zero
to five six, over.

48:09.615 --> 48:11.580
We just got five aggressive
bombers heading west

48:11.582 --> 48:13.580
on 48 and 48 17 niner...

48:16.182 --> 48:17.580
481, we'll adjust, over.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.266
What the hell
are you doing here?

57:23.366 --> 57:24.731
You need to leave.

57:24.733 --> 57:26.999
Excuse me.

57:27.001 --> 57:28.364
Leave.

57:28.366 --> 57:29.932
Listen, old chap,
if you really are

57:29.934 --> 57:32.899
working for the military
you need to take a moment.

57:32.901 --> 57:34.666
There's a war on.

57:36.001 --> 57:37.431
You smell like a brewery.

57:37.433 --> 57:39.165
Just go.

57:39.167 --> 57:41.634
I think your superiors need
to know what's happening here.

57:44.299 --> 57:45.367
Wait.

57:47.001 --> 57:47.834
What?

57:49.567 --> 57:51.231
Do you want to help me?

57:51.233 --> 57:52.634
I don't think I do.

57:56.534 --> 57:58.865
Find me this man.

58:38.301 --> 58:40.967
Mr. Price, you don't know me,

58:40.969 --> 58:44.299
and I understand that this
letter may come out of nowhere,

58:44.301 --> 58:45.600
but I feel like I
must write to you

58:45.602 --> 58:47.934
with the utmost urgency.

58:47.936 --> 58:49.600
I fear I may have
uncovered something

58:49.602 --> 58:51.801
truly awful in this area.

58:51.803 --> 58:54.333
This site that you
once investigated.

58:54.335 --> 58:56.233
I implore you for help.

58:56.235 --> 58:58.569
I need your help.

58:59.836 --> 59:00.703
Mr. Price.

59:04.335 --> 59:06.704
- Your morning mail, sir.
- Thank you, dear boy.

59:23.870 --> 59:24.837
Lieutenant O'Neill.

59:27.137 --> 59:29.468
Good god, Harry Price.

59:29.470 --> 59:31.637
Your correspondence,
it intrigued me.

59:35.704 --> 59:37.002
Would you like a drink?

59:37.004 --> 59:39.203
Tea would be
splendid, thank you.

59:40.970 --> 59:42.437
Should I even be here?

59:43.504 --> 59:44.935
I work for
Allied communications

59:44.937 --> 59:47.769
listening in on
German transmissions.

59:47.771 --> 59:49.102
I see.

59:49.104 --> 59:51.135
Sounds like complicated work.

59:51.137 --> 59:52.436
It is.

59:52.438 --> 59:53.705
And not without
its difficulties.

59:55.037 --> 59:56.337
Lieutenant...

59:57.538 --> 59:59.538
- Robert, please.
- Thank you.

01:00:00.604 --> 01:00:03.903
So shall we talk about
what's been happening to you?

01:00:03.905 --> 01:00:04.772
Of course.

01:00:13.872 --> 01:00:17.605
Sorry, I'm American and tea
isn't exactly our forte.

01:00:19.739 --> 01:00:21.971
Starting at the
beginning is difficult.

01:00:23.405 --> 01:00:24.772
What brought you here?

01:00:25.905 --> 01:00:29.037
Mr. Price, I'm still governed
by the Official Secrets Act.

01:00:29.039 --> 01:00:31.837
I'm not asking for
details, dear boy.

01:00:31.839 --> 01:00:33.704
I merely wish to know
how you ended up here.

01:00:33.706 --> 01:00:36.904
I was transferred
by a recommendation.

01:00:36.906 --> 01:00:40.004
I'm an expert in languages,
specifically German.

01:00:40.006 --> 01:00:41.370
You are?

01:00:41.372 --> 01:00:43.707
I spent some time in
Germany before the war.

01:00:45.173 --> 01:00:48.104
Before, him.

01:00:48.106 --> 01:00:49.538
I see.

01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:51.937
It's not enough to
understand a language.

01:00:51.939 --> 01:00:55.138
To know another language you
need to know the culture,

01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:57.571
how they interact, how
they love, how they...

01:00:57.573 --> 01:00:59.072
You don't see
them as the enemy?

01:00:59.074 --> 01:01:02.304
No, no, Hitler, yeah.

01:01:02.306 --> 01:01:03.805
He's a monster.

01:01:03.807 --> 01:01:05.705
Most of German high
command are monsters too,

01:01:05.707 --> 01:01:09.304
but the soldiers, they're
just young men like us.

01:01:09.306 --> 01:01:11.204
Us?

01:01:11.206 --> 01:01:12.605
Me.

01:01:12.607 --> 01:01:14.605
I'm sorry, I'm just nervous.

01:01:14.607 --> 01:01:16.237
I read your book by the way.

01:01:16.239 --> 01:01:18.472
Well, glad to hear it.

01:01:18.474 --> 01:01:20.372
I'd like to know
more about Marianne.

01:01:20.374 --> 01:01:22.405
And what
would you like to know?

01:01:22.407 --> 01:01:24.539
- Well, who was she?
- Was?

01:01:24.541 --> 01:01:26.439
Is, she's still alive, dear boy.

01:01:26.441 --> 01:01:28.039
Is she?

01:01:28.041 --> 01:01:29.240
Why of course.

01:01:30.175 --> 01:01:31.075
I see.

01:01:32.207 --> 01:01:35.272
And after that, that was when
I decided to write to you.

01:01:35.274 --> 01:01:36.340
I see.

01:01:37.441 --> 01:01:38.673
So
what's your opinion?

01:01:38.675 --> 01:01:40.006
My opinion?

01:01:40.008 --> 01:01:43.205
Well, I need to
gather my thoughts.

01:01:43.207 --> 01:01:44.872
No, no, please, Mr. Price,

01:01:44.874 --> 01:01:47.642
instinctively what
are your thoughts?

01:01:48.874 --> 01:01:50.974
That this is the
work of a fantasist.

01:01:52.008 --> 01:01:53.406
You're joking, right?

01:01:53.408 --> 01:01:54.440
I'm afraid not.

01:01:54.442 --> 01:01:55.939
A fantasist?

01:01:55.941 --> 01:02:00.808
Robert, I say this not to
antagonise you, but to...

01:02:01.808 --> 01:02:03.339
There are two
schools of thought,

01:02:03.341 --> 01:02:05.773
one, that these events
are indeed real,

01:02:05.775 --> 01:02:10.975
or that they are the work
of the deluded or liars.

01:02:11.909 --> 01:02:13.373
So I'm a liar?

01:02:13.375 --> 01:02:15.609
I don't
believe you are.

01:02:16.875 --> 01:02:17.743
Okay.

01:02:19.009 --> 01:02:21.174
I believe in life after death,

01:02:21.176 --> 01:02:26.609
but unlike my peers I cannot
merely rush to a conclusion.

01:02:27.809 --> 01:02:31.075
To have blind
faith in a subject.

01:02:31.077 --> 01:02:33.974
You require no proof
merely to believe.

01:02:33.976 --> 01:02:35.407
I need more than that.

01:02:35.409 --> 01:02:37.409
I know, I read your works.

01:02:38.342 --> 01:02:39.874
In the cases you investigated,

01:02:39.876 --> 01:02:42.507
several of them you yourself
proved to be hoaxes,

01:02:42.509 --> 01:02:44.508
but Borley was
different wasn't it?

01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:45.575
Borley was different.

01:02:45.577 --> 01:02:46.943
You believed it was real?

01:02:48.110 --> 01:02:51.108
There were certain events
that took place that,

01:02:51.110 --> 01:02:53.108
yes, I couldn't disprove.

01:02:53.110 --> 01:02:54.542
Then what about me?

01:02:54.544 --> 01:02:56.041
Your case
is slightly different.

01:02:56.043 --> 01:02:56.910
Slightly?

01:02:57.810 --> 01:03:02.109
Well, Robert, I cannot
merely believe you.

01:03:02.111 --> 01:03:03.709
I must examine the facts.

01:03:03.711 --> 01:03:05.408
All right, then
what are those?

01:03:05.410 --> 01:03:07.777
You are an
alcoholic, are you not?

01:03:08.744 --> 01:03:09.942
I...

01:03:09.944 --> 01:03:12.142
And I believe
you are still suffering

01:03:12.144 --> 01:03:13.711
from a form of shell shock.

01:03:14.744 --> 01:03:16.009
I'm...

01:03:16.011 --> 01:03:17.678
And you forget I've
seen that face before,

01:03:18.611 --> 01:03:19.742
the faces of the
young men returning

01:03:19.744 --> 01:03:21.578
from France in the Great War.

01:03:22.877 --> 01:03:24.576
Mr. Price...

01:03:24.578 --> 01:03:26.177
It's all over
your face, Robert.

01:03:26.179 --> 01:03:29.844
It's etched like trenches.

01:03:31.211 --> 01:03:32.278
Go on.

01:03:34.945 --> 01:03:38.509
This area, the
books, the photograph,

01:03:38.511 --> 01:03:42.209
the transmissions,
all of these things,

01:03:42.211 --> 01:03:46.577
they impair your ability to
reach a logical conclusion.

01:03:46.579 --> 01:03:49.110
Mr. Price, I won't
deny any of that,

01:03:49.112 --> 01:03:50.878
but I did see something.

01:03:52.179 --> 01:03:53.512
Time is short.

01:03:54.678 --> 01:03:58.379
I believe that it's urgent
medical help you require

01:03:59.412 --> 01:04:01.044
and to return to
the United States.

01:04:01.046 --> 01:04:02.512
You're leaving?

01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:05.011
I'm afraid I must.

01:04:05.013 --> 01:04:07.477
As I say, I cannot help you.

01:04:07.479 --> 01:04:09.243
Mr. Price, in your
book you yourself

01:04:09.245 --> 01:04:11.711
said that you must
investigate all possibilities

01:04:11.713 --> 01:04:14.144
before coming to a conclusion.

01:04:14.146 --> 01:04:15.611
And?

01:04:15.613 --> 01:04:17.144
You've listened to my story

01:04:17.146 --> 01:04:18.911
and you've seen the evidence
of my state of mind,

01:04:18.913 --> 01:04:21.777
but you still haven't seen
anything for yourself.

01:04:21.779 --> 01:04:22.844
Right.

01:04:22.846 --> 01:04:23.744
Then stay here.

01:04:23.746 --> 01:04:25.580
One night, that's all I ask.

01:04:26.346 --> 01:04:27.744
And if nothing happens?

01:04:27.746 --> 01:04:30.012
Then I will request
immediate transfer

01:04:30.014 --> 01:04:32.211
and demobbing to the U.S.

01:04:32.213 --> 01:04:33.278
Is that your word?

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:34.447
Absolutely.

01:04:36.114 --> 01:04:37.213
Very well.

01:04:38.213 --> 01:04:39.280
Thank you.

01:04:40.413 --> 01:04:41.680
But if I'm right?

01:04:42.947 --> 01:04:43.814
Yes.

01:04:46.747 --> 01:04:48.980
Robert, in order for me

01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:53.079
to help you I need
to know something.

01:04:53.081 --> 01:04:53.947
Yes?

01:04:54.914 --> 01:04:57.414
What exactly
happened over there?

01:04:58.847 --> 01:05:01.379
The same thing that
happens to everyone else.

01:05:01.381 --> 01:05:03.915
I believe
your story is different.

01:05:05.115 --> 01:05:06.214
What?

01:05:07.647 --> 01:05:11.381
The German solider,
the woods in Italy.

01:05:12.681 --> 01:05:16.748
You said you were separated
from your platoon.

01:05:18.347 --> 01:05:19.948
- I ran.
- You ran?

01:05:22.115 --> 01:05:26.715
We were supposed to be
storming this German post.

01:05:28.015 --> 01:05:29.413
They cut us to ribbons.

01:05:29.415 --> 01:05:32.413
Machine gun fire, Molotovs.

01:05:32.415 --> 01:05:35.715
It was like we were
rats in a barrel.

01:05:36.648 --> 01:05:40.614
I stood in the middle of
this gunfire and I ran.

01:05:42.248 --> 01:05:43.716
I see.

01:05:44.682 --> 01:05:48.014
My entire platoon
was cut down.

01:05:48.016 --> 01:05:50.580
And I escaped only to have

01:05:50.582 --> 01:05:53.716
a German soldier
stumble across me,

01:05:54.549 --> 01:05:56.647
but that wasn't the worst of it.

01:05:56.649 --> 01:06:00.014
My platoon commander, he
thought I just got separated

01:06:00.016 --> 01:06:01.949
and rewarded me with gallantry.

01:06:06.050 --> 01:06:08.247
But I ran like a coward.

01:06:08.249 --> 01:06:10.314
You're no coward, Robert.

01:06:10.316 --> 01:06:12.516
You merely did
not wish to die.

01:06:13.616 --> 01:06:17.214
I'd been in combat situations
for two years before that.

01:06:17.216 --> 01:06:18.283
Not a problem.

01:06:20.583 --> 01:06:22.283
But in that moment I...

01:06:24.983 --> 01:06:28.382
The body has a point
of no return, Robert.

01:06:28.384 --> 01:06:31.049
A point where it
can take no more

01:06:31.051 --> 01:06:34.918
and that point is
different for each person.

01:06:35.850 --> 01:06:37.514
And you think
that was it for me?

01:06:37.516 --> 01:06:39.183
I'd reached my point?

01:06:39.185 --> 01:06:40.683
I believe so.

01:06:41.650 --> 01:06:43.415
Well, what about you then?

01:06:43.417 --> 01:06:44.716
Where's your point?

01:06:44.718 --> 01:06:47.049
I hope I never
reach that point.

01:06:47.051 --> 01:06:48.382
Okay.

01:07:33.219 --> 01:07:34.087
Robert?

01:08:49.822 --> 01:08:50.688
Robert?

01:09:01.022 --> 01:09:02.121
Robert?

01:09:24.421 --> 01:09:25.386
Mr. Price?

01:09:25.389 --> 01:09:26.987
Mr. Price, what is it?

01:09:26.988 --> 01:09:27.823
My heart.

01:09:28.723 --> 01:09:30.054
Did you see something?

01:09:30.055 --> 01:09:32.353
You saw something in
the garden, didn't you?

01:09:32.354 --> 01:09:33.756
Was it the nun?

01:11:04.425 --> 01:11:05.859
You can see me?

01:11:06.993 --> 01:11:07.859
Yes.

01:11:09.459 --> 01:11:10.525
Am I dreaming?

01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:13.692
Am I dreaming?

01:11:15.559 --> 01:11:17.525
There's only one
way to find out.

01:11:19.325 --> 01:11:23.323
Usually when your hand
touches mine you disappear.

01:11:23.325 --> 01:11:24.526
I usually wake up.

01:12:12.494 --> 01:12:13.561
Mr. Price,

01:12:14.762 --> 01:12:16.895
look, do you really
think you should be?

01:12:18.029 --> 01:12:20.027
You're right of
course, dear boy.

01:12:20.029 --> 01:12:23.562
You know, it's not often
that one in this field

01:12:24.729 --> 01:12:27.361
experiences something that
chills you to the bone,

01:12:28.328 --> 01:12:32.194
but today I fear
that is the case.

01:12:32.196 --> 01:12:33.428
So it was her then?

01:12:35.562 --> 01:12:37.560
There's a theory that
it's not the houses

01:12:37.562 --> 01:12:40.460
that are haunted,
but the people.

01:12:40.462 --> 01:12:41.528
The people?

01:12:42.963 --> 01:12:45.660
Have you never wondered
why some families,

01:12:45.662 --> 01:12:50.830
they can experience such terror,

01:12:51.496 --> 01:12:53.361
yet others see nothing?

01:12:54.996 --> 01:12:56.963
I've never really
thought about it.

01:12:58.362 --> 01:13:02.763
The people, from the
other side or wherever,

01:13:03.896 --> 01:13:06.863
it's as if they survive on
the heartbreak of the living.

01:13:08.362 --> 01:13:11.496
It's upon you like
a shroud, dear boy.

01:13:12.496 --> 01:13:14.696
The heartbreak, the
horrors of the war.

01:13:16.697 --> 01:13:19.262
So what am I, a divining rod?

01:13:21.797 --> 01:13:23.564
I don't quite know, Robert.

01:13:24.597 --> 01:13:26.731
We're on the very
edge of science.

01:13:29.064 --> 01:13:33.261
There is no actionable evidence,
merely what we perceive.

01:13:33.263 --> 01:13:35.929
Look, Mr. Price, if
you're not gonna take this...

01:13:35.931 --> 01:13:41.330
Robert, I feel your case
requires further investigation.

01:15:49.102 --> 01:15:51.232
You needn't worry, Lieutenant.

01:15:51.234 --> 01:15:53.133
I'm not spying.

01:15:53.135 --> 01:15:54.535
Who said I was worried?

01:15:55.401 --> 01:15:56.767
It is the Deutschland

01:15:56.769 --> 01:15:59.900
you're at war with, not Austria.

01:15:59.902 --> 01:16:03.335
I know, but last I checked
Hitler was from Austria.

01:16:04.635 --> 01:16:07.533
Of course I have been vetted

01:16:07.535 --> 01:16:09.867
by das Englander government.

01:16:09.869 --> 01:16:11.266
But not by mine.

01:16:11.268 --> 01:16:14.233
Robert, Rudi is here to help.

01:16:14.235 --> 01:16:15.667
I don't doubt that,

01:16:15.669 --> 01:16:17.201
but the sort of
trouble I would be in

01:16:17.203 --> 01:16:20.167
having civilians in here,
least of all a German.

01:16:20.169 --> 01:16:21.835
- Austria.
- Well, whichever.

01:16:21.837 --> 01:16:25.735
Robert, you do want
to be helped don't you?

01:16:25.737 --> 01:16:26.835
All I
know is the kind

01:16:26.837 --> 01:16:28.803
of punishment treason carries.

01:16:29.903 --> 01:16:33.000
Well, what is the price
for your own sanity?

01:16:33.002 --> 01:16:34.534
Excuse me?

01:16:34.536 --> 01:16:36.369
You have not been sleeping.

01:16:38.137 --> 01:16:41.401
The eyes, they never lie.

01:16:41.403 --> 01:16:43.070
- I have been sleeping.
- Nein.

01:16:44.170 --> 01:16:47.334
You've been walking the
grounds at the Borley Rectory.

01:16:47.336 --> 01:16:49.603
For how long, hm?

01:16:51.204 --> 01:16:52.436
Any ideas?

01:16:53.369 --> 01:16:54.836
Look...

01:16:54.838 --> 01:16:57.771
If you want to turn
me away that is fine,

01:16:58.937 --> 01:17:02.571
but I think I may
be your best chance.

01:17:03.704 --> 01:17:07.537
Robert, Rudi is one of
my most trusted colleagues.

01:17:08.437 --> 01:17:10.535
I will vouch for him personally.

01:17:13.370 --> 01:17:16.671
Robert, I am not a spy.

01:17:19.672 --> 01:17:21.169
Okay.

01:17:21.171 --> 01:17:22.471
Okay, what next?

01:17:23.871 --> 01:17:28.871
Next, next we should
start at the beginning.

01:17:41.939 --> 01:17:43.905
That is quite a story.

01:17:44.839 --> 01:17:46.972
- It's not a story.
- Oh, but it is.

01:17:48.939 --> 01:17:50.204
At least to others,

01:17:50.206 --> 01:17:52.806
they will think it's a
story, will they not?

01:17:54.371 --> 01:17:55.839
I don't know what it is.

01:17:58.238 --> 01:18:01.039
Rudi, what are your thoughts?

01:18:02.339 --> 01:18:07.205
Robert is experiencing
something I have no word for.

01:18:07.207 --> 01:18:08.738
What do you mean?

01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:11.604
It isn't just
seeing the nun is it?

01:18:11.606 --> 01:18:15.840
It's Marianne in your
dreams and in the flesh.

01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:20.971
The general consensus is
that the dead haunts living

01:18:20.973 --> 01:18:23.572
not the living
haunting the living.

01:18:23.574 --> 01:18:25.272
Can you help me?

01:18:29.306 --> 01:18:30.474
I am not sure.

01:18:31.407 --> 01:18:32.474
What?

01:18:36.307 --> 01:18:37.472
You've seen her too?

01:18:37.474 --> 01:18:39.674
The nun, yes.

01:18:40.574 --> 01:18:42.672
What is the
basis for this nun?

01:18:42.674 --> 01:18:46.872
Ah, now you see the
unpublished story goes

01:18:46.874 --> 01:18:50.607
that the nun, she
becomes pregnant.

01:18:51.307 --> 01:18:53.974
Now naturally due to her faith

01:18:55.174 --> 01:18:59.774
her crimes exact the most
severe of punishments.

01:19:01.308 --> 01:19:03.807
Is that who it is, this nun?

01:19:04.941 --> 01:19:08.772
I believe that most
entities of the afterlife

01:19:08.774 --> 01:19:12.075
often lack awareness
of what they are.

01:19:13.008 --> 01:19:18.042
They are, what is the
word, more emotive.

01:19:18.775 --> 01:19:19.808
What do you mean?

01:19:20.775 --> 01:19:25.006
A man dies, for
example, of old age.

01:19:25.008 --> 01:19:27.374
He passes peacefully.

01:19:28.075 --> 01:19:28.975
There is no pain.

01:19:30.075 --> 01:19:33.008
His emotion is less emotive.

01:19:34.142 --> 01:19:39.174
Therefor he's less likely to
interfere with the other side,

01:19:39.176 --> 01:19:40.676
with our world.

01:19:41.842 --> 01:19:46.609
Think of the most
powerful emotions, love.

01:19:49.110 --> 01:19:49.943
Hate.

01:19:50.943 --> 01:19:51.809
Fear.

01:19:53.843 --> 01:19:58.508
A pregnant women murdered
by the ones she trusted

01:19:58.510 --> 01:20:00.843
in the name of
the God she loved.

01:20:04.076 --> 01:20:07.543
Think of the pure
hatred that must've

01:20:08.477 --> 01:20:12.308
filled her heart at
that precise moment.

01:20:12.310 --> 01:20:13.376
Oh my god.

01:20:16.810 --> 01:20:17.709
Yeah.

01:20:19.676 --> 01:20:20.543
Indeed.

01:20:21.477 --> 01:20:23.942
Looks like
I'm in your hands, Rudi.

01:20:23.944 --> 01:20:28.308
It is my plan to induce
a trance into Robert

01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:30.810
pushing him into a
dream-like state.

01:20:34.977 --> 01:20:38.210
With each tick you
will feel your body

01:20:38.212 --> 01:20:40.710
slowly drifting into sleep.

01:20:42.945 --> 01:20:44.277
We shall begin.

01:22:30.181 --> 01:22:31.579
There she is.

01:22:34.381 --> 01:22:37.415
You must make a
contact with her.

01:22:39.048 --> 01:22:41.446
Reach, reach out to her.

01:22:44.915 --> 01:22:45.814
Reach out.

01:22:48.381 --> 01:22:51.248
Quickly, before she leaves.

01:22:56.116 --> 01:23:00.015
Robert, you must
control your feelings.

01:23:01.915 --> 01:23:02.782
Let go.

01:23:06.782 --> 01:23:07.882
Yeah.

01:23:09.183 --> 01:23:10.982
Seek the answers.

01:23:12.217 --> 01:23:13.646
Nein.

01:23:13.648 --> 01:23:15.582
She is getting away.

01:23:23.117 --> 01:23:24.316
Who is this?

01:23:27.183 --> 01:23:28.748
That is not her.

01:23:29.616 --> 01:23:31.916
She is not the one you seek.

01:23:33.282 --> 01:23:34.750
Don't hurt me.

01:23:57.617 --> 01:24:00.182
This one is possessed.

01:24:00.184 --> 01:24:01.617
She's possessed.

01:24:21.085 --> 01:24:23.384
Is this what you
wanted to show me?

01:24:24.651 --> 01:24:26.585
An innocent woman murdered.

01:24:29.551 --> 01:24:32.018
How she doesn't know
peace yet, is that it?

01:24:39.952 --> 01:24:41.518
It's not just her is it?

01:24:42.785 --> 01:24:46.618
She has a child, and her
child, an unborn child.

01:24:52.019 --> 01:24:53.686
Both of them, each.

01:25:01.319 --> 01:25:02.886
But maybe I can help.

01:25:07.552 --> 01:25:09.286
I know what I have to do.

01:25:34.020 --> 01:25:34.954
It's you.

01:25:35.954 --> 01:25:36.920
It's you.

01:25:37.787 --> 01:25:38.653
You're Marianne.

01:25:41.653 --> 01:25:44.120
I'm not
sure why I'm here today.

01:25:44.122 --> 01:25:47.820
Something flashed through
my mind, a vision.

01:25:48.787 --> 01:25:49.986
For her.

01:25:49.988 --> 01:25:51.718
I came for her.

01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:53.553
- The nun?
- Yes.

01:25:55.055 --> 01:25:57.853
- She needs to be at peace.
- Exactly.

01:25:57.855 --> 01:26:01.654
She wasn't vengeful,
she wanted help.

01:26:03.088 --> 01:26:04.654
I'm here to finish her story.

01:26:05.721 --> 01:26:08.055
I have felt her presence
for so many years.

01:26:09.021 --> 01:26:11.121
Her cries for help
echoing through

01:26:11.123 --> 01:26:12.988
these now saddened corridors.

01:26:14.488 --> 01:26:16.621
You've been in my dreams too.

01:26:20.588 --> 01:26:23.887
We're connected, all of us.

01:26:29.354 --> 01:26:31.589
We both need to help her.

01:27:59.524 --> 01:28:00.558
She's here.

01:28:15.592 --> 01:28:16.825
Whoever you were.

01:28:18.193 --> 01:28:19.625
This cross is for you.

01:28:27.291 --> 01:28:28.358
Why us?

01:28:31.425 --> 01:28:34.323
Maybe all three of us
were lost in some way,

01:28:34.325 --> 01:28:36.991
you, me, the nun.

01:29:30.964 --> 01:29:35.964
