01:41.518 --> 01:43.311
Engine room!

01:43.479 --> 01:45.730
This is the Captain!

01:45.898 --> 01:48.065
Throw coal to the fuckin' boiler!

01:48.233 --> 01:51.277
And a hard right rudder!
(laughs)

01:52.696 --> 01:55.364
Hello, the galley!

01:55.532 --> 01:58.785
Fuckin' jeroboam of champagne
to the bridge immediately!

02:01.705 --> 02:03.706
Uh, Mr. T.

02:03.874 --> 02:06.042
Brief, uh, idle time,

02:06.210 --> 02:08.711
a harmless wilin' away.

02:08.878 --> 02:11.631
I'm considering, Con,

02:11.799 --> 02:14.842
being Swearengen's decided
a underling'll represent him

02:15.010 --> 02:18.304
in certain of our mutual transactions,
would it be my seemly tactic

02:18.472 --> 02:21.390
to do likewise?

02:21.558 --> 02:23.142
Con: Hmm.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.603
I'd need to know
my man had discipline

02:25.771 --> 02:29.106
and appetites in fuckin' harness
and the like.

02:31.527 --> 02:33.611
Well, what this is, sir, uh...

02:33.779 --> 02:36.489
yesterday I occasioned
to fuck a woman

02:36.657 --> 02:39.116
after a considerable
period of abstention,

02:39.284 --> 02:41.702
and that seems now to have

02:41.870 --> 02:44.539
throwed me unawares

02:44.706 --> 02:48.376
into a fuckin' spasm of sex interest,

02:48.544 --> 02:51.379
which I...

02:51.547 --> 02:53.965
fuckin' pray will be brief.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.385
Well...

02:57.553 --> 03:02.098
I believe I'll defer enlisting you
in this other aspect.

03:02.266 --> 03:06.227
Prudent, sir,
till I get well on the other fuckin' side.

03:17.489 --> 03:20.575
- Iceberg fuckin' avoided.
- (giggling)

03:20.742 --> 03:23.286
Looming fuckin' catastrophe.

03:23.453 --> 03:26.330
Mr. Tolliver and Mr. Swearengen are...

03:26.498 --> 03:29.834
- uneasy colleagues.
- I wouldn't know, sir.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.338
That feels to me less than a full verity.

03:34.506 --> 03:38.050
I don't know what
that means, Mr. Hearst.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.886
That you not knowin' about any...

03:40.053 --> 03:43.347
uneasiness between Tolliver
and Swearengen

03:43.515 --> 03:45.933
- sounds to me like a lie.
- Yeah.

03:46.101 --> 03:49.312
- I guess so.
- Better.

03:52.566 --> 03:55.902
Would you want me saying
my first loyalty was to you, Mr. Hearst,

03:56.069 --> 03:58.613
or to verity instead of Mr. Swearengen?

03:58.780 --> 04:02.158
That'd sound like a lie too
and peg me a liar in the bargain.

04:02.326 --> 04:04.285
So I'll have to win you away.

04:04.453 --> 04:06.078
I guess so.

04:06.246 --> 04:09.457
But I oughtn't to imagine
the process will be quick.

04:09.625 --> 04:11.459
Guess not.

04:13.045 --> 04:14.837
Good, Adams.

04:15.005 --> 04:16.880
Did he coach you long?

04:17.048 --> 04:20.134
Didn't fuckin' coach me
at all, Mr. Hearst.

04:26.016 --> 04:28.517
Captain Turner?

04:33.065 --> 04:35.566
Go tell your friend
I know he's afraid of me.

04:36.568 --> 04:38.361
Dority? Big guy?

04:38.528 --> 04:40.947
I guess he looks big to you.

04:42.074 --> 04:45.493
Is that what you brought me here for?
You want me to take that back to Dority?

04:45.661 --> 04:47.578
I guess so.

04:53.001 --> 04:55.544
Crazy nigger at the livery
is in your debt.

04:55.712 --> 04:57.505
Crazy nigger at the livery

04:57.673 --> 04:59.882
ought not plan on this becomin' no habit.

05:00.050 --> 05:02.593
No chance of that.
He's bound for Oregon, Miss Lady,

05:02.761 --> 05:05.388
with the handsome nigger
you're talkin' to right now,

05:05.555 --> 05:09.058
- if our luck holds to the afternoon.
- Get off your ass and start to walkin'--

05:09.226 --> 05:11.143
your friend might get to eat that warm.

05:12.729 --> 05:15.022
Go ahead.
Put a hole in that thing.

05:15.190 --> 05:18.901
I'm measurin' the stroke to move
you along with the rest of this shit.

05:21.780 --> 05:23.656
Much obliged.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.491
Travel safe.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.830
Biggest day of my goddamn life

05:30.998 --> 05:33.749
and I get a fuckin' spittoon
spilled over my head.

05:33.917 --> 05:36.127
That you already knocked on its side

05:36.294 --> 05:38.129
when you were fuckin' dozing.

05:38.296 --> 05:39.797
I'm glad I did it.

05:39.965 --> 05:43.342
I've enough blood and guts
spilt in my goddamn place, Steve.

05:43.510 --> 05:46.554
For a lifetime, you understand?!

05:48.056 --> 05:50.099
If it takes the contents of a spittoon

05:50.267 --> 05:53.644
to make you fuckin' wash,
then so fuckin' be it!

05:53.812 --> 05:56.188
What does washin' have
to do with the other, Tom?

05:56.356 --> 05:59.233
Well, to put you on the fuckin' path!

05:59.401 --> 06:03.029
Fuckin' respect yourself
and the fuckin' occasion,

06:03.196 --> 06:07.575
and bring no more fuckin' shame
onto my place, God damn it!

06:15.000 --> 06:18.586
After I own the livery,
you slanty-eyed bastards,

06:18.754 --> 06:21.422
maybe you'd like to come by
and look at me then!

06:21.590 --> 06:24.258
Now get the fuck outta here!

06:25.302 --> 06:28.596
Here! Harry, what time is it?

06:30.265 --> 06:32.099
Hour's 17 minutes till 10:00.

06:32.267 --> 06:36.520
67 minutes until my fuckin' luck
changes forever.

06:36.688 --> 06:39.440
No harm in him showin' up early.

06:45.781 --> 06:48.699
AW: You've done this camp
a great service, Mrs. Ellsworth.

06:48.867 --> 06:51.494
You're very kind.

06:53.497 --> 06:57.124
And yet, Mr. Merrick, in candor,

06:57.292 --> 07:00.586
witnessing the events
of late in the East,

07:00.754 --> 07:03.964
oughtn't any depositor
pause and consider

07:04.132 --> 07:08.385
before trusting
his savings to a bank?

07:10.472 --> 07:13.682
Uh, well, I suppose that's true.

07:16.895 --> 07:18.813
Which is why

07:18.980 --> 07:21.398
a bank owned locally,

07:21.566 --> 07:25.194
wishing to make available
funds to organize

07:25.362 --> 07:27.696
- and develop our community...
- Mm-hm.

07:27.864 --> 07:30.741
...to build businesses and homes,

07:30.909 --> 07:34.286
and whose deposits are
guaranteed by gold

07:34.454 --> 07:36.997
not two miles distant
from this building

07:37.165 --> 07:38.791
in which we sit,

07:38.959 --> 07:40.960
isn't that

07:41.128 --> 07:44.672
why the depositor at the Bank
of Deadwood, having considered,

07:44.840 --> 07:48.175
ought come forward
in assurance and confidence?

07:49.386 --> 07:51.011
Yes.

07:51.179 --> 07:52.721
Yes.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.436
Have you any questions for me?

08:01.982 --> 08:04.900
I have not, madam.
Not-- not at the present moment.

08:20.625 --> 08:22.710
(moans)

08:36.933 --> 08:39.058
Dan: Well, I guess that
argues for me showing

08:39.227 --> 08:41.477
Captain Cuntface
how goddamn afraid I am.

08:41.645 --> 08:44.607
It wasn't aftertalk between
you and Turner?

08:44.774 --> 08:46.734
Hearst was there when Turner said it,

08:46.902 --> 08:49.403
and Hearst I asked did he
want it brought back to you.

08:49.571 --> 08:51.906
Hearst says to me, "I guess so."

08:52.073 --> 08:54.617
"Guess so" don't sound like Hearst.

08:54.784 --> 08:57.745
I'd said "I guess so" before.
I think he was making small of me.

09:02.584 --> 09:04.668
What is there to consider over, Al?

09:05.879 --> 09:07.922
That sea creature Turner called me out.

09:08.089 --> 09:11.175
It's Hearst calling you out.
I'm trying to decipher his reason.

09:11.343 --> 09:14.553
Me seein' to Turner will not
delay your goddamn decipherin'.

09:14.721 --> 09:17.556
Can you shut up now, Dan,
that you fuckin' couldn't before?

09:17.724 --> 09:21.268
He hurt you,
then he calls you like a dog.

09:21.436 --> 09:23.479
I had to tell him to fuck himself.

09:23.647 --> 09:26.899
Even as I forbore till I could see
to my fuckin' arrangements.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.276
Think they'll get seen to by the snows?

09:54.177 --> 09:55.928
(cocks)

09:56.096 --> 09:57.638
Ready your pen.

09:57.806 --> 10:00.015
Your addressing me like
a fuckin' field hand

10:00.183 --> 10:02.309
won't impede me cooperatin'.

10:03.979 --> 10:06.063
- (horse whinnies)
- Now go!

10:08.733 --> 10:11.735
That-- that's it, Hostetler.

10:17.242 --> 10:19.868
Steve:
'Cause I keep my sense of priority

10:20.036 --> 10:22.121
on what the fuck is important.

10:24.499 --> 10:26.667
I broke your fuckin' tip.

10:31.423 --> 10:33.215
"Mrs. Alma Ellsworth,

10:33.383 --> 10:37.386
serene and comely principal
of the just opened Deadwood Bank,

10:37.554 --> 10:41.432
assured this reporter that depositors
need fear no local echo

10:41.599 --> 10:43.684
of Eastern financial panics.

10:43.852 --> 10:45.853
A locally-owned bank--"

10:46.980 --> 10:48.689
- Careful, be careful.
- Thank you.

10:48.857 --> 10:52.067
Uh, "lending to develop businesses
and build homes in the region,

10:52.235 --> 10:54.486
and backed by
the underground assets

10:54.654 --> 10:58.198
of one of the strongest mining concerns
in the Dakota territory,

10:58.366 --> 11:01.076
- such a bank cannot help but--"
- (squishes)

11:01.244 --> 11:03.162
(groans)
Do you mind if we

11:03.330 --> 11:05.414
walk on more level ground,
Mr. Blazanov?

11:05.582 --> 11:08.208
- Oh, no no no. I'll watch out for livestock.
- Thank you.

11:08.376 --> 11:10.377
"Such a bank cannot help

11:10.545 --> 11:13.339
but draw prudent customers
in great numbers

11:13.506 --> 11:16.050
from every area of our Black Hills."

11:19.054 --> 11:21.013
Mrs. Ellsworth, being so elevated,

11:21.181 --> 11:23.932
so sweetly radiant in spirit,

11:24.100 --> 11:25.893
I wonder if her words

11:26.061 --> 11:28.395
resonated with me at the time

11:28.563 --> 11:31.774
as being more poetic and compelling

11:31.941 --> 11:34.443
than now they seem in cold transcription

11:34.611 --> 11:36.570
and with the lady herself absent.

11:36.738 --> 11:38.864
This is bad.

11:41.493 --> 11:44.411
To abandon a friend like that
when he's overtaken by drink!

11:44.579 --> 11:46.789
I think this is more woeful, Mr. Merrick.

12:04.516 --> 12:06.809
We shall fetch the sheriff, Mr. Blazanov.

12:15.276 --> 12:17.319
(sighs heavily)
Leon.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.447
Mr. Tolliver.

12:22.242 --> 12:26.203
That's a guilty skulkin' fuckin' look
on your features, son.

12:27.956 --> 12:30.165
I'd think by now you'd
be more come to terms

12:30.333 --> 12:33.043
with your weaknesses.

12:34.421 --> 12:37.131
Merciless conscience, sir,
since childhood.

12:37.298 --> 12:38.715
You're buyin' drugs?

12:38.883 --> 12:41.510
I was buying drugs, yes, sir.

12:41.678 --> 12:45.013
That is the fuckin' cross
my weakness has to bear.

12:46.558 --> 12:50.269
And do you bear it for yourself alone,
Leon, or long as you're about it,

12:50.437 --> 12:54.189
with others as well
and earn the extra dollar thereby?

12:54.357 --> 12:56.233
I do not do that, sir, no.

12:56.401 --> 12:58.277
I got to wonder, son...

13:00.071 --> 13:02.990
is it you that's been helpin' Lila
in her fall?

13:03.158 --> 13:04.908
It is not, Mr. Tolliver.

13:05.076 --> 13:06.910
Lila drops her own bucket down the well.

13:07.078 --> 13:09.538
I'm telling you, sir!
Takin' a whore of yours down,

13:09.706 --> 13:11.748
that's next to directly robbing you.

13:11.916 --> 13:14.001
Fella like me that's been...

13:14.169 --> 13:16.253
indisposed,

13:16.421 --> 13:18.755
to show he's back in play

13:18.923 --> 13:21.800
might cut a thief's throat.

13:21.968 --> 13:24.511
You're fuckin' misinterpreting it.

13:24.679 --> 13:27.639
I-I was copping for another
but it wasn't fuckin' Lila.

13:27.807 --> 13:31.643
(groans) I was copping
for that cunt at the bank.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.770
(sniffles)

13:36.524 --> 13:38.817
AW:
Their faces weren't familiar,

13:38.985 --> 13:41.695
the men who left him here.

13:41.863 --> 13:44.490
His name was Pasco.

13:49.370 --> 13:51.413
Does Pasco have a friend here?!

14:09.098 --> 14:10.641
AW:
How do you know his name?

14:10.808 --> 14:13.310
Charlie:
Cornishman, talked union,

14:13.478 --> 14:15.020
worked for Hearst.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.272
Do you feel there's
a significance to that?

14:21.027 --> 14:23.654
The third of those
Cornish organizers's been killed.

14:25.323 --> 14:28.867
You've got nothin' to say to that
or on any other fuckin' topic.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.162
On Hearst's orders, you believe?

14:32.330 --> 14:35.290
A knife to the chest, body atop
Hearst's works in the thoroughfare.

14:35.458 --> 14:37.251
I withdraw from our agreement.

14:37.418 --> 14:39.836
I'd ask its very brief extension.

14:40.004 --> 14:41.421
No.

14:41.589 --> 14:44.550
No. Or we're both
just fuckin' cowards.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.052
I ain't no fucking coward!

14:47.220 --> 14:49.930
Though Dan might support
your position.

14:56.938 --> 14:59.106
What's he talking about?

15:00.817 --> 15:02.651
Wait a bit, Bullock.

15:02.819 --> 15:05.779
Don't go for Hearst yet.
You know Al.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.829
I've got the briefest of other business.

15:13.997 --> 15:16.456
See to it.

15:16.624 --> 15:19.084
Yes, s-see to it, Bullock.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.546
(slams)

15:32.890 --> 15:35.392
(sighs)

15:36.811 --> 15:38.270
(sniffs)

15:49.574 --> 15:53.368
Watching us advance
on your stupid teepee, Chief,

15:53.536 --> 15:55.954
knowing you had to make your move...

15:57.665 --> 16:00.292
did you not just want first

16:00.460 --> 16:03.545
to fucking understand?

16:05.340 --> 16:07.174
Huh?

16:20.271 --> 16:23.732
Your repayment of the loan
we make you now, Mr. Fields,

16:23.900 --> 16:27.486
whose proceeds purchase
Mr. Hostetler's livery,

16:27.654 --> 16:30.656
is secured by the livery deed itself

16:30.823 --> 16:33.617
to be held as collateral

16:33.785 --> 16:37.954
in the possession of the bank
until the debt shall be satisfied.

16:38.122 --> 16:40.957
Understood and agreed to.

16:41.125 --> 16:44.753
And don't lose one second
to wakefulness or worry.

16:44.921 --> 16:47.297
I'll repay in a timely fashion.

16:52.387 --> 16:56.473
Will you be paid in specie
or currency, Mr. Hostetler?

16:56.641 --> 16:59.184
Gold, please.

17:01.312 --> 17:03.772
(safe opens)

17:05.692 --> 17:07.275
(closes)

17:10.154 --> 17:12.280
Thank you, Trixie.

17:21.665 --> 17:23.834
I don't suppose a handshake

17:24.001 --> 17:27.212
signaling the transaction's completion

17:27.380 --> 17:29.172
is absolutely required.

17:30.717 --> 17:33.093
Then I guess we won't have to do it then.

17:55.950 --> 17:59.828
And if you're hoping to pass as a man
before you hightail it to Oregon,

17:59.996 --> 18:02.956
you will return to me
that board you made me sign.

18:07.211 --> 18:09.129
(exhales)

18:14.343 --> 18:17.053
(door opens, closes)

18:20.266 --> 18:23.018
Thank you so much
for squiring me,

18:23.186 --> 18:27.439
these gentlemen being so obviously
compelled by other responsibilities.

18:30.902 --> 18:33.904
Such acid scrutiny
by former boon companions.

18:34.906 --> 18:37.824
We was never your fucking
boon companions, EB.

18:37.992 --> 18:41.578
Forgive my confusing, Dan,
my own deep feelings for you

18:41.746 --> 18:44.456
with what yours may have been for me.

18:47.835 --> 18:50.253
EB:
I did not offer my hotel to Hearst,

18:50.421 --> 18:52.672
which sale has made me
outcast among you.

18:54.842 --> 18:57.677
Hearst forced
the transaction upon me.

19:00.848 --> 19:02.933
I miss our morning coffee.

19:10.024 --> 19:11.691
(knocks)

19:11.859 --> 19:14.820
Yeah?

19:22.912 --> 19:26.206
Being no one is frequenting
the main bar, Davey,

19:26.374 --> 19:29.793
what in fuck business you think
you're gonna do standing behind there?

19:29.961 --> 19:32.045
Boss says I'm to attend
the auxiliary bar.

19:32.213 --> 19:35.966
The auxiliary bar ain't made
a cunt hair's bit of business sense

19:36.133 --> 19:38.510
since its fuckin' inception!

19:41.430 --> 19:43.723
Go on up and set the boss straight.

19:45.101 --> 19:47.477
Hey, you don't want to take
that smart-aleck tone,

19:47.645 --> 19:49.980
that fuckin' attitude with me, Davey.
You hear me?

19:50.147 --> 19:53.692
Hearst organizes violence
between his man and Dority.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.486
- Does he?
- Orchestrates combat between them,

19:56.654 --> 20:00.407
mutilates me, plants that organizer's body
like a flag in the fuckin' thoroughfare.

20:00.575 --> 20:02.284
That last is fresh news.

20:02.451 --> 20:05.954
Makes of me and Tolliver
a two-headed beast

20:06.122 --> 20:09.165
to savage what might be healthy borne
out of the fucking election

20:09.333 --> 20:11.751
and gnaw its own privates off-hours.

20:11.919 --> 20:15.338
Plans keep coming to the cocksucker

20:15.506 --> 20:18.258
that their final sum is this:

20:18.426 --> 20:21.970
but for what brings income to him,
break what he can;

20:22.138 --> 20:24.514
what he can't, set those parts

20:24.682 --> 20:26.683
against themselves to weaken.

20:26.851 --> 20:28.351
Scoundrel!

20:30.396 --> 20:32.439
Hearst.

20:38.029 --> 20:42.532
The why's what fucking confounds me.

20:42.700 --> 20:45.660
What's in his head
I cannot fucking find in mine?

20:49.415 --> 20:51.124
Don't suppose you talk to the captain?

20:51.292 --> 20:53.627
Hails and farewells,
but he never replies.

20:53.794 --> 20:57.172
- Or the cook?
- The negress and I are not intimate.

20:57.340 --> 20:58.924
All right, EB.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.718
- May I ask your plans, Al?
- No.

21:01.886 --> 21:03.887
Only to further their achievement.

21:04.055 --> 21:08.350
- No.
- All right.

21:08.517 --> 21:10.435
All right.

21:13.898 --> 21:15.774
Yeah.

21:20.488 --> 21:24.324
Glad to have been of help.
Always available to counsel.

21:39.590 --> 21:42.968
I dare not think what you've
been through to reach us.

21:43.135 --> 21:46.513
It's been a crucifixion.

21:46.681 --> 21:49.683
Too painful,
even the merest details.

21:56.190 --> 21:58.400
(sighs)

21:58.567 --> 22:01.695
Formidable, even at bay.

22:01.862 --> 22:04.781
(weak chuckle)

22:04.949 --> 22:07.659
My last camp, Jack.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.911
As it may be for us all, young man.

22:10.079 --> 22:12.539
The place is yearning for elevation

22:12.707 --> 22:14.749
and festering with wealth.

22:14.917 --> 22:16.584
Oh dear.

22:16.752 --> 22:19.170
Augment of cupidity in the iris,

22:19.338 --> 22:22.090
a healthy augury.

22:22.258 --> 22:25.885
We must help them
however we can.

22:26.053 --> 22:28.013
(both chuckle)

22:28.180 --> 22:30.515
Heave ho, young man,

22:30.683 --> 22:33.184
but slowly.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.686
(door opens)

22:39.275 --> 22:43.403
It's past me.
I cannot figure the fucking angle.

22:43.571 --> 22:46.573
Go ahead and fucking fight him.

22:46.741 --> 22:48.867
All right then.

23:05.176 --> 23:06.801
What you want to be carrying, Dan?

23:06.969 --> 23:09.345
Nothing I would want
found secreted on me,

23:09.513 --> 23:11.931
worse comes to worst.

23:12.099 --> 23:14.684
Well, don't say you ain't
bringing your blade.

23:14.852 --> 23:17.020
Naked, visible in its fucking sheath

23:17.188 --> 23:20.148
and dispensable before we join.

23:20.316 --> 23:23.359
If he dispenses with his.

23:23.527 --> 23:26.654
If it's getting to go wrong, Dan,

23:26.822 --> 23:29.407
you just drop down flat.

23:29.575 --> 23:31.409
What the fuck did you just say?

23:31.577 --> 23:34.370
Drop flat if it's going wrong

23:34.538 --> 23:36.289
and I'll blow his fucking head off.

23:36.457 --> 23:39.918
You do and it'll be the last goddamn thing
you do on this fucking earth.

23:40.086 --> 23:44.297
Going wrong is not the end
of fucking things, Johnny.

23:44.465 --> 23:47.050
Fuck no!

23:47.218 --> 23:49.219
I have come back from plenty of shit

23:49.386 --> 23:51.179
that looked like it was going wrong.

23:51.347 --> 23:53.139
All right, Dan.

23:58.145 --> 24:01.606
He's got the advantage
on you there, don't he?

24:01.774 --> 24:03.900
That short-cropped fucking hair?

24:07.863 --> 24:11.282
Well, he's not lacking for brass.

24:11.450 --> 24:14.786
"Come scare me in the thoroughfare."

24:17.289 --> 24:19.374
Star City, Captain,

24:19.542 --> 24:22.293
you remember the man's name?

24:22.461 --> 24:25.296
Leonard.

24:25.464 --> 24:28.466
That was a fight.

24:28.634 --> 24:30.176
Not how I remember.

24:32.012 --> 24:35.723
...As an object lesson
to every man watching.

24:35.891 --> 24:37.934
For not much fight,
it did not end quickly

24:38.102 --> 24:41.729
I suppose is what I'm trying to say.
Do you understand me?

24:41.897 --> 24:44.607
Yes, I understand.
(grunting)

25:44.168 --> 25:46.753
(wagon rattles loudly)

26:05.522 --> 26:07.565
Oh, you son of a bitch!

26:11.195 --> 26:13.571
(Dan groans)

26:21.247 --> 26:24.540
(crashing, clamoring)

26:27.336 --> 26:30.338
(horses whinny)

26:37.388 --> 26:39.305
(grunting)

27:09.336 --> 27:11.296
(screaming)

27:16.135 --> 27:18.344
(screams)

28:11.899 --> 28:14.400
(coughing)

28:15.444 --> 28:19.280
(vomits, coughing)

28:41.220 --> 28:43.930
(continuous screaming)

29:05.577 --> 29:07.495
(screaming stops)

29:09.415 --> 29:11.958
- (coughs)
- (Turner moaning)

29:14.920 --> 29:16.587
(groaning)

29:30.018 --> 29:31.727
(Dan screams)

29:47.161 --> 29:49.328
(faint wheeze)

30:12.478 --> 30:14.353
(coughing)

30:27.034 --> 30:29.035
Thank you, Jack.

30:30.871 --> 30:33.831
I am your Jack, Chesterton,

30:33.999 --> 30:37.668
but your producer too.

30:38.879 --> 30:41.839
A rigor we've always sustained.

30:42.007 --> 30:44.842
To carry a performer through illness

30:45.010 --> 30:47.053
when recovery is in prospect

30:47.221 --> 30:50.556
is an indulgence
one can sometimes justify.

30:50.724 --> 30:53.684
But support of idleness

30:53.852 --> 30:56.312
destined for the grave,

30:56.480 --> 30:58.314
that, Chesterton,

30:58.482 --> 31:02.985
the narrow economy
of our art does not permit.

31:04.404 --> 31:07.573
You would have me die destitute?

31:07.741 --> 31:10.409
You will purchase your keep
with that voice--

31:10.577 --> 31:13.538
intrusive
and incessantly opinionated--

31:13.705 --> 31:17.083
no vagary of our past has yet stilled.

31:17.251 --> 31:19.252
The subject?

31:19.419 --> 31:21.712
We have but one. In this instance,

31:21.880 --> 31:25.091
the theater is formerly a bordello.

31:25.259 --> 31:28.970
The eye lines must be quite wrong.

31:29.137 --> 31:31.764
(chuckles)

31:31.932 --> 31:35.017
In the morning, it meets

31:35.185 --> 31:38.145
with your atrabilious scrutiny.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.953
Oh...

31:54.121 --> 31:56.497
I must rest.

32:13.181 --> 32:15.141
Bellegarde?

32:15.309 --> 32:17.810
We proceed.

32:21.607 --> 32:24.692
- Costumes, Countess, will you chair?
- Ja.

32:24.860 --> 32:26.736
Props and scenery, chair?

32:26.903 --> 32:29.405
Only if you serve as second.

32:29.573 --> 32:33.367
I'm so so so so sorry.
Is costumes taken?

32:33.535 --> 32:36.621
- Are they performing now?
- Quiet.

32:40.375 --> 32:42.126
Civic relations--

32:42.294 --> 32:44.045
I'd appoint myself...

32:44.212 --> 32:46.380
without objection?

32:47.674 --> 32:51.052
Will we continue
as if all among us are well

32:51.219 --> 32:54.013
when one so plainly is not?

32:54.181 --> 32:57.892
And what committee, Bellegarde,
to address the old man's mortal illness

32:58.060 --> 33:00.478
- would you have us fucking form?
- No committee.

33:00.646 --> 33:02.521
Committees is the task before us.

33:02.689 --> 33:06.150
- No business as usual.
- Business and tasks is what we'll have,

33:06.318 --> 33:09.195
just as you are tardy
and ginger on your bum

33:09.363 --> 33:11.405
for the usual fucking reasons,

33:11.573 --> 33:13.991
despite your deep personal grief.

33:16.912 --> 33:19.246
Not offered as a case for change.

33:20.707 --> 33:22.750
Civic relations is me,

33:22.918 --> 33:25.878
and we'll include here
a subcommittee

33:26.046 --> 33:28.673
for the renovation of the bordello.

33:28.840 --> 33:32.426
Supervision of the work, subcommittee
head-- Countess, done, with thanks.

33:32.594 --> 33:34.428
Civic relations,

33:34.596 --> 33:37.556
construction subcommittee, Claudia.

33:39.685 --> 33:41.894
Countess is the second.

33:42.062 --> 33:44.021
Hiring laborers.

33:45.357 --> 33:48.943
A truth divinely writ:

33:49.111 --> 33:51.362
We make more devotees of theater

33:51.530 --> 33:54.907
engaging 20 laborers at $2 apiece

33:55.075 --> 33:57.618
than two of the same at $20.

34:00.997 --> 34:03.958
Busy busy busy.
(chuckles)

34:05.544 --> 34:07.628
Is he receiving as yet?

34:07.796 --> 34:10.005
Let me go see.

34:11.216 --> 34:15.219
Tell him last fucking call.

34:17.931 --> 34:20.933
Broken bones mortally
interfering with organs

34:21.101 --> 34:24.603
- is what I would like to rule out.
- (knocks)

34:28.024 --> 34:30.275
Doc's back, Dan.

34:30.444 --> 34:33.446
(shakily)
I don't need the fucking doc.

34:33.612 --> 34:36.239
Come on, Dan.
Let him look at you.

34:36.408 --> 34:38.534
He come back special.

34:38.702 --> 34:41.203
You heard what the fuck I said.

34:41.371 --> 34:43.539
He wants to poke around
in some innards,

34:43.706 --> 34:45.666
tell him to work on the one I killed.

34:49.212 --> 34:50.838
Bottle?

34:52.466 --> 34:54.300
One of the girls?

34:54.467 --> 34:57.553
There's a clamoring line
to see to you.

34:57.721 --> 35:00.097
Get the fuck out of here, Johnny.

35:00.265 --> 35:02.933
Sure.

35:20.744 --> 35:23.078
Listen for raspy

35:23.246 --> 35:24.789
fucking shallow breathing

35:24.956 --> 35:26.957
in the course of the fucking night.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.959
Him going blue too, would hint to you

35:29.127 --> 35:32.630
- to fucking come get me.
- Definitely.

36:02.911 --> 36:06.163
(pants)

37:07.934 --> 37:10.519
Alma:
Have you ample towels?

37:12.689 --> 37:14.356
Uh, ample, thank you.

37:19.487 --> 37:21.322
Enough hot water?

37:21.489 --> 37:25.200
Well, I could almost wish it cooler.

37:32.792 --> 37:34.752
(sighs)

37:40.133 --> 37:42.301
May I help you with your back?

37:42.469 --> 37:44.428
What?

37:45.805 --> 37:47.765
Scrubbing your back.

37:51.645 --> 37:54.813
Uh, I'm out now.

37:54.981 --> 37:57.316
Thanks anyhow.

38:14.668 --> 38:18.504
Does it occur to you, banging
repeatedly on the fucking wall,

38:18.672 --> 38:21.966
either I'm not in-- which makes
what you're doing stupid--

38:22.133 --> 38:24.510
or being in, don't want to see you--

38:24.678 --> 38:27.221
which makes you a pain in my balls!?

38:29.057 --> 38:33.560
(softly) Doubtless now nodding agreement
like Little Boy fucking Lost.

38:43.530 --> 38:45.698
(Trixie groans)

38:48.952 --> 38:50.703
What?

38:50.870 --> 38:53.080
Hello.

38:53.248 --> 38:55.207
You fucking work at the bank.

38:55.375 --> 38:57.501
I do now.

38:57.669 --> 38:59.878
Not a noble "hello" at opening

39:00.046 --> 39:02.756
and regal fucking look-by
at the closing up of shop.

39:02.924 --> 39:05.134
I'm at the hardware store
all day, Trixie.

39:05.301 --> 39:07.136
I'll switch with you.

39:07.303 --> 39:09.638
Bank's a Jew's
proper province anyways--

39:09.806 --> 39:12.766
along with the addled self-deceived.

39:12.934 --> 39:14.977
Our depositors?

39:15.145 --> 39:16.979
The bank's founder and president,

39:17.147 --> 39:19.773
chief officer, as well,
of air-headed smugness

39:19.941 --> 39:23.068
and headlong plunges unawares
into the fucking abyss.

39:23.236 --> 39:26.071
- I don't understand.
- You wouldn't.

39:26.239 --> 39:28.240
You're too fucking healthy-minded.

39:29.701 --> 39:33.412
You'll sit here waiting for me to materialize
from a piece of fucking furniture

39:33.580 --> 39:36.165
and think the world is normal.

39:36.332 --> 39:38.584
(sighs)

39:38.752 --> 39:40.794
Do you want to get fucked or not?

39:40.962 --> 39:43.630
Please.

39:49.220 --> 39:52.222
Your hair looks like a porcupine's.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.475
Forgot the brush.

40:03.109 --> 40:04.902
Do you mind?

40:05.070 --> 40:06.945
Well, no no no.

40:07.113 --> 40:09.156
That's...

40:10.784 --> 40:14.453
- How's it now?
- Better.

40:14.621 --> 40:16.789
Thanks very much.

40:16.956 --> 40:19.416
I haven't finished.

40:19.584 --> 40:23.170
Oh, go ahead then. Go on.

40:29.385 --> 40:32.679
- Presentable?
- Very.

40:33.932 --> 40:36.809
You're young for failing eyesight.

40:45.401 --> 40:48.362
Spiny too, like a porcupine.

40:48.530 --> 40:50.531
Huh-uh.

41:09.217 --> 41:12.010
I guess it'd be unmanly

41:12.178 --> 41:14.680
to fear I may faint.

41:17.684 --> 41:19.810
Please don't.

42:11.029 --> 42:13.363
I'll make some arrangement.

42:15.241 --> 42:18.076
What do you mean?

42:18.244 --> 42:21.622
For my things and the like...

42:21.789 --> 42:24.041
arrange to collect my things.

42:30.924 --> 42:32.507
Will you have me...

42:32.675 --> 42:34.843
bring the little one back?

42:38.181 --> 42:41.683
- I'll collect Sofia.
- Don't forget.

42:46.606 --> 42:49.733
Seth: Five hours looking
for this goddamn board.

42:51.527 --> 42:54.488
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, yeah.

42:55.782 --> 42:57.866
(grunting)

42:59.452 --> 43:01.954
Steve: You think
this is pretty fucking funny,

43:02.121 --> 43:05.165
- don't you, Hostetler?
- No.

43:06.501 --> 43:09.461
Watch me crawl around here
like a goddamn fool,

43:09.629 --> 43:12.381
and you laughing
up your fucking sleeve.

43:13.841 --> 43:17.970
Hostetler don't know where
the board is. I'm the one hid it.

43:18.137 --> 43:21.223
Oh, I believe that. Definitely.

43:21.391 --> 43:24.559
Assistant fucking baboon.
You hid it,

43:24.727 --> 43:28.063
he don't know where
and you can't remember where it is!

43:28.231 --> 43:31.566
Fields: I wasn't too drunk
not to know I should hide it,

43:31.734 --> 43:34.486
but I was too drunk

43:34.654 --> 43:36.780
to keep track of where.

43:46.332 --> 43:49.501
Is this it? Is this the board?

43:49.669 --> 43:52.546
Clean it the fuck off!

43:52.714 --> 43:54.131
Well...

43:54.299 --> 43:56.216
Yeah. (laughs)

43:56.384 --> 43:58.635
Bring it here.
Bring it in.

43:58.803 --> 44:00.929
Unwrap that cocksucker!

44:18.031 --> 44:20.282
What the fuck
is that supposed to be?

44:25.455 --> 44:27.414
Give him the board.

44:28.708 --> 44:32.127
You think I'm a fucking moron?

44:32.295 --> 44:34.588
You think I'm a moron

44:34.756 --> 44:37.883
- to fall for your fucking lies.
- Don't you call me dishonest.

44:38.051 --> 44:40.469
I'll call you that and worse.

44:40.636 --> 44:43.638
You hand me that and then
ride off with the actual board?

44:43.806 --> 44:47.225
This is the actual board, wrapped in
the cheesecloth that I stole off a horse.

44:47.393 --> 44:49.728
I never knew this board was took

44:49.896 --> 44:54.149
from where I had it until I looked for it
during late last night,

44:54.317 --> 44:57.194
and that's when he told me
that he had hid it.

44:57.362 --> 45:00.072
To keep you from doing
something stupid.

45:00.239 --> 45:04.993
This is the board, for Christ's sake!
What difference does the rest of it make?

45:05.161 --> 45:09.122
I don't know it's the actual board.
There's no more fucking writing on it!

45:09.290 --> 45:11.750
Shall I accept myself as satisfied,

45:11.918 --> 45:13.752
only for Hostetler once escaped

45:13.920 --> 45:16.546
to send the real fucking board
back from Cheyenne

45:16.714 --> 45:19.841
- while he's laughing up his lying sleeve?
- (growling)

45:21.469 --> 45:25.806
For Bullock to open the package
and humiliate me?

45:25.973 --> 45:28.767
Or for the fucking bank woman
to humiliate me

45:28.935 --> 45:33.271
with the true fucking board?
Or to revoke my fucking security

45:33.439 --> 45:35.732
on my fucking loan?

45:35.900 --> 45:39.528
Or whatever your fucked-up plan
is to make me a fucking cunt!

45:39.695 --> 45:42.447
I will not be called

45:42.615 --> 45:45.158
a fucking liar.

45:45.326 --> 45:47.452
I didn't live my life for that.

45:47.620 --> 45:51.581
Yeah, fuck you, Steve. We're leaving.
Talk stupid to our fucking dust!

45:53.209 --> 45:55.252
(gunshot)

46:17.650 --> 46:20.652
- (knock on door)
- Yeah?

46:22.822 --> 46:26.324
I wish you'd look in on Dan, boss.

46:26.492 --> 46:28.827
Not for being poorly as...

46:28.995 --> 46:31.163
down.

46:31.330 --> 46:33.206
Johnny,

46:33.374 --> 46:36.084
some shit's best
walked through alone.

46:37.128 --> 46:39.546
Dan's killed people before.
You have too,

46:39.714 --> 46:43.175
but neither've been solitary after.

46:43.342 --> 46:45.135
A fair fight,

46:45.303 --> 46:48.013
something Dan and I have
always struggled to avoid,

46:48.181 --> 46:50.640
is different.

46:50.808 --> 46:53.477
You see the light go out of their eyes.

46:53.644 --> 46:56.438
It's just you left

46:56.606 --> 46:58.315
and death.

46:58.483 --> 47:00.525
So that's why Dan wants to be alone.

47:00.693 --> 47:02.652
He knows where to find me.

47:07.033 --> 47:10.202
Sit down if you want to.

47:32.016 --> 47:34.226
What are-- what are we waiting for?

47:34.393 --> 47:37.812
To see what kind
of hell breaks loose.

47:38.940 --> 47:41.483
(piano music playing)

47:54.413 --> 47:56.623
Whiskey, please.

47:58.417 --> 48:00.377
And leave the bottle.

48:04.340 --> 48:07.133
I just saw to the remains of a friend.

48:07.301 --> 48:09.344
Yes, sir.

48:17.603 --> 48:19.938
George Hearst.

48:20.106 --> 48:22.274
Jack Young.

48:23.317 --> 48:26.111
- Jack Young.
- Yes, sir.

48:26.279 --> 48:29.656
- How do you do, Jack?
- How do you do?

48:33.995 --> 48:35.620
- Sheriff.
- Is he up there?

48:35.788 --> 48:37.872
- Who?
- Is Hearst fucking up there, Farnum?

48:38.040 --> 48:40.709
I cannot say.
I cannot say.

48:40.876 --> 48:43.670
I cannot betray
the whereabouts

48:43.838 --> 48:46.339
of an owner-guest.

48:52.680 --> 48:54.681
(exhales)

48:58.227 --> 49:00.270
Mr. Hearst...

49:00.438 --> 49:03.607
I regret not being out here
with you before, sir.

49:03.774 --> 49:05.984
Help too stupid
to wake me from my nap.

49:06.152 --> 49:07.819
Not at all.

49:07.987 --> 49:10.196
Go on down there now, Jack.

49:10.364 --> 49:12.449
At least do that much right.

49:18.706 --> 49:20.665
Hell of a fucking day.

49:21.834 --> 49:24.044
How much do you know?

49:26.505 --> 49:29.883
I heard there was a set-to
in the thoroughfare.

49:30.051 --> 49:32.677
Did you know it was my man killed?

49:32.845 --> 49:34.679
Was that the outcome?

49:34.847 --> 49:36.890
My man was killed, yes.

49:37.058 --> 49:39.184
I'm sorry.

49:39.352 --> 49:43.355
It happens.
It's the nature of things.

49:43.522 --> 49:46.399
It don't lessen the sadness

49:46.567 --> 49:48.568
when it's a friend.

49:51.530 --> 49:54.616
The sheriff joins us.

49:58.621 --> 50:00.705
Whiskey.

50:00.873 --> 50:03.166
The sheriff recently
put me on notice

50:03.334 --> 50:05.085
he is vigilant

50:05.252 --> 50:08.338
of my possible transgressions.

50:09.965 --> 50:12.801
You sound drunk to me.

50:17.264 --> 50:19.140
Whom are you addressing?

50:19.308 --> 50:22.477
You. You sound drunk.

50:22.645 --> 50:26.398
- Do I?
- Mm-hmm.

50:27.733 --> 50:30.402
When I say "Fuck yourself, Sheriff,"

50:30.569 --> 50:32.946
will you put that down to drunkenness

50:33.114 --> 50:36.157
or a high estimate of your athleticism?

50:39.620 --> 50:41.496
Did you just tell me

50:41.664 --> 50:43.415
to fuck myself?

50:43.582 --> 50:45.917
I think I did, and to shut up

50:46.085 --> 50:49.421
or I'll quiet you myself.

50:49.588 --> 50:52.215
- You're under arrest.
- Fuck you,

50:52.383 --> 50:54.259
and shut up

50:54.427 --> 50:56.511
or I will shut you up for good.

50:56.679 --> 50:58.179
(growls)

50:58.347 --> 51:00.557
(piano stops)

51:02.351 --> 51:05.937
Threatening a peace officer,

51:06.105 --> 51:07.939
I'm taking you into custody.

51:08.107 --> 51:10.942
- Don't be stupid, Bullock--
- Don't you be fucking stupid.

51:11.110 --> 51:12.485
(shouts)

51:14.280 --> 51:16.281
Fuck you.

51:16.449 --> 51:17.824
(groans)

51:26.000 --> 51:27.792
Johnny.

51:32.173 --> 51:35.842
The sheriff eliminates
several of our options.

51:49.023 --> 51:51.441
Not a fucking word comes to print.

51:51.609 --> 51:53.818
