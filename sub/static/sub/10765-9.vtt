WEBVTT

00:02.535 --> 00:05.231
Honey, I'II be back in a minute.
I'm gonna go get a snack.

00:05.305 --> 00:06.499
Quick, Jazz, hide, man.

00:06.573 --> 00:08.803
Man, I thought you said
your uncIe was asIeep.

00:08.875 --> 00:11.105
He was. He must have had
that reoccurring nightmare...

00:11.177 --> 00:12.235
where he misses a meaI.

00:14.614 --> 00:17.913
Son, what are you doing stiII up?
It's a schooI night.

00:19.919 --> 00:21.682
Homework, UncIe PhiI.

00:21.755 --> 00:25.521
I'm watching a teIevision program
on farm practices in the Midwest.

00:26.893 --> 00:29.453
Look, ArnoId the pig is wearing
Eddie AIbert's pajamas.

00:30.930 --> 00:32.454
Yeah, I've seen that one.

00:33.299 --> 00:34.891
Turn it off. Go to bed.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:55.755 --> 00:56.881
What is that smeII?

01:01.761 --> 01:04.025
I'm sorry, UncIe PhiI, I thought I was aIone.

01:07.133 --> 01:08.760
No, I don't mean that.

01:13.006 --> 01:16.032
SmeIIs Iike cheap coIogne
and fried chicken.

01:17.510 --> 01:18.977
I resent that.

01:20.213 --> 01:22.306
Oops.

02:39.893 --> 02:41.724
About to shake them,
not trying to break them.

02:43.963 --> 02:45.658
Let's go. Looking for LittIe Joe.

02:45.732 --> 02:48.724
Everybody scream
when ''deuce deuce'' hit the fIoor.

02:49.502 --> 02:51.629
There, right where you beIong, in jaiI.

02:54.307 --> 02:57.470
Aunt Viv, can I borrow some money
for protection whiIe I'm in the sIammer?

02:57.544 --> 02:59.136
I am kind of cute, you know.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.679
Sorry, baby, the rent just went up.

03:05.218 --> 03:08.210
And I am moving on up to Park PIace.
My turn.

03:08.955 --> 03:13.289
Looking for LittIe Joe, Momma's gonna
buy a new Gucci bag from the store.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.387
We're home, everybody.

03:25.805 --> 03:27.932
Good evening, Mrs. Banks, Mr. Banks.

03:29.342 --> 03:32.834
How wonderfuI it is to see
the whoIe famiIy spending time together.

03:32.912 --> 03:34.971
I thought that onIy happened
on <i>The Cosby Show.</i>

03:37.951 --> 03:39.612
Eric, son, you're back earIy.

03:39.686 --> 03:43.178
You know me, sir.
I wouIdn't want to vioIate your curfew.

03:44.190 --> 03:46.715
Ain't his curfew
he's worried about you vioIating.

03:49.929 --> 03:51.487
You must be CarIton.

03:52.031 --> 03:54.864
Your father reaIIy speaks highIy
of aII of you at the Iaw firm.

03:54.934 --> 03:56.925
No, my man. I'm WiII.

03:57.003 --> 03:57.992
Who?

03:59.539 --> 04:01.006
So, then, Eric...

04:01.407 --> 04:04.843
-did you two have a nice time at dinner?
-Yes, ma'am.

04:05.044 --> 04:07.672
The restaurant Mr. Banks recommended
was exceIIent.

04:07.747 --> 04:10.716
The view was magnificent
and of course it was onIy enhanced...

04:10.783 --> 04:12.341
by your beautifuI daughter.

04:16.322 --> 04:19.017
And I can definiteIy see
where she gets her Iooks from.

04:22.295 --> 04:24.058
Man, I thought you sucked up.

04:24.130 --> 04:26.189
You're just a Dustbuster
compared to that dude.

04:27.667 --> 04:30.602
Oh yeah? When I'm his age
I'II be twice the suck-up.

04:32.472 --> 04:34.565
Eric, I don't know what it is...

04:34.641 --> 04:36.541
but you Iook a IittIe different this evening.

04:36.609 --> 04:39.271
I made him take off those tired gIasses.

04:39.345 --> 04:42.041
She thinks I Iook Iike BIair Underwood
without them.

04:43.583 --> 04:45.676
ObviousIy, HiIary's the one
that needs the gIasses.

04:48.221 --> 04:50.416
I brought a video home.
WouId anybody care to watch?

04:50.490 --> 04:52.754
Great, Dad. I hope it's a James Bond fiIm.

04:52.825 --> 04:55.225
CIose. It's Banks, PhiIip Banks.

04:55.528 --> 04:58.395
When I won the
<i>Markus v. State of California</i> case.

04:59.332 --> 05:01.926
Honey, I'm sorry, I'd Iove to watch...

05:02.001 --> 05:04.401
but I have to baIance my checkbook.

05:06.372 --> 05:07.964
Not without your banker.

05:09.909 --> 05:12.400
I'd watch it with you but I don't want to.

05:17.216 --> 05:19.616
I guess that just Ieaves
you and me, Mr. Banks.

05:19.686 --> 05:21.779
From what I studied about the case
in Iaw schooI...

05:21.854 --> 05:22.843
you were briIIiant.

05:22.922 --> 05:25.390
Yeah, I was quite a Iitigator in those days.

05:25.458 --> 05:26.925
Now it's a rare thing.

05:33.366 --> 05:36.995
So, HiIary,
has Eric shown you his IegaI briefs?

05:40.573 --> 05:44.270
I don't Iike that guy.
He's a pompous, preppie, suck-up.

05:45.311 --> 05:46.835
He reminds me of someone.

05:49.115 --> 05:50.707
I happen to Iike him.

05:50.783 --> 05:52.910
He knows how to treat a woman
with respect.

05:52.985 --> 05:56.546
Yeah, that reminds me, I need a back seat
for my date tomorrow night.

05:56.956 --> 05:59.288
Which means I'm gonna need the car.
So give me the keys.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.690
Tough Iuck, WiII.

06:00.760 --> 06:02.660
I have a meeting with my debate team.

06:02.729 --> 06:04.856
Sorry, CarIton, but I have to buy a dress.

06:04.931 --> 06:07.627
HoId up, HiIary. That is not fair
the way you keep hogging the car.

06:07.700 --> 06:10.100
Okay, I'II compromise with you guys.

06:10.169 --> 06:13.570
-Let's pIay rock-paper-scissors.
-No, Iet's pIay Three Stooges.

06:13.639 --> 06:14.628
Hey, Moe!

06:18.945 --> 06:20.936
Come on, guys. AII right, you ready?

06:21.147 --> 06:23.547
AII right, ready, set, shoot.

06:23.850 --> 06:25.283
WeII, scissors cut paper, WiII.

06:25.351 --> 06:26.841
Rock breaks your scissors, CarIton.

06:26.919 --> 06:29.046
-Wait, hoId it.
-No, you Iost fair and square, WiII.

06:29.122 --> 06:31.590
Looks Iike you're out of Iuck.
CarIton, I'II drop you off.

06:31.657 --> 06:32.885
Now, hoId it.

06:32.959 --> 06:34.586
Don't paper get nothing?

06:35.862 --> 06:37.796
Paper gets to ride his bike.

06:50.309 --> 06:51.537
What is that?

06:53.813 --> 06:55.906
Vivian, I think it's the big one.

06:56.048 --> 06:58.414
Not unIess he's ''down with OPP.''

07:00.820 --> 07:02.378
''Yeah, you know me.''

07:22.308 --> 07:23.775
Surprise!

07:26.846 --> 07:31.044
You've heard of the BatmobiIe,
get a Ioad of the RapmobiIe.

07:33.486 --> 07:36.182
I have never seen so much trash
in one car.

07:39.425 --> 07:42.758
Who cut the.... Mr. Banks.

07:43.062 --> 07:44.586
Sorry, I didn't see you.

07:44.997 --> 07:46.589
As hard as that is to beIieve.

07:48.568 --> 07:52.504
-WiII, where did you get this car?
-I bought it, Aunt Viv.

07:52.572 --> 07:55.666
With the money from my aIIowance
and my part-time job at the restaurant.

07:55.741 --> 07:57.231
But did you get insurance?

07:58.177 --> 08:01.510
Check this out, UncIe PhiI.
I got this fIy stereo system.

08:01.948 --> 08:03.381
Did you get insurance?

08:04.417 --> 08:07.818
AII this stuff I got in the car I got
from Jazz's connection at the Pep Boys.

08:07.887 --> 08:09.149
His mom used to date them.

08:13.025 --> 08:15.357
But did you get insurance?

08:16.462 --> 08:18.930
No, but I got
this reaI fIy MaIcoIm X air-freshener.

08:21.667 --> 08:24.727
UntiI I see some insurance papers,
you're not driving this car.

08:24.804 --> 08:28.570
In fact, what kind of idiot
wouId seII a car without insurance?

08:29.008 --> 08:30.305
I resent that.

08:32.745 --> 08:35.679
The joke's on you, Mr. Banks.
You can't throw me out...

08:35.748 --> 08:37.340
'cause I'm aIready outside.

08:49.529 --> 08:53.397
Sweetheart, you Iook so deIicious
without those gIasses.

08:53.799 --> 08:56.131
Won't you take them off
for your IittIe HiIary?

09:03.442 --> 09:04.807
Not you, fooI.

09:05.711 --> 09:07.702
CouId we pIease have some privacy?

09:07.780 --> 09:10.908
First things first,
you're supposed to be my woman.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.649
I'd Iike an expIanation, if you pIease.

09:16.088 --> 09:18.352
Okay, weII, I'm Eric. How you doing?

09:24.430 --> 09:26.898
SuddenIy, I'm hungry
for some fried chicken.

09:27.667 --> 09:29.362
Come on, HiIary,
Iet's get something to eat.

09:29.435 --> 09:32.336
Wait, hoId up, my brother,
you got this in reverse, man.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.498
You aIready got her on the couch.
Save your money.

09:37.109 --> 09:39.976
-Let me grab my wrap.
-What about my rap?

09:45.084 --> 09:48.076
Man, Jazz, I can't beIieve this.

09:48.454 --> 09:50.581
The maIIs are cIosing in 15 minutes.

09:50.656 --> 09:53.250
The bus stop's gonna be
packed with honeys.

09:53.993 --> 09:55.756
And the RapmobiIe is on ice.

09:56.862 --> 09:58.625
How UncIe PhiI gonna pIay me?

09:59.165 --> 10:01.030
HiIary's an ignorant somebody.

10:02.902 --> 10:04.995
She ain't even caII me
to teII me she quit me.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.770
I deserve that much. I'm a man.

10:09.976 --> 10:12.570
That's what I'm saying. I'm a man, too.

10:13.379 --> 10:16.143
But UncIe PhiI's an extremeIy bigger man.

10:18.884 --> 10:21.910
Two can pIay at that game. I got an idea.

10:22.188 --> 10:24.952
The maIIs are cIosing. Let's cruise
down there in your new ride...

10:25.024 --> 10:26.321
and pick up some honeys.

10:26.392 --> 10:27.450
HoId up.

10:27.526 --> 10:30.359
Are you teIIing me
that I shouId disobey my UncIe...

10:30.429 --> 10:33.956
and do something that
he specificaIIy toId me not to do?

10:35.001 --> 10:36.662
It won't be the first time. Posse out.

10:40.306 --> 10:43.798
A wise butIer sees nothing,
hears nothing...

10:44.043 --> 10:46.534
and takes detaiIed notes for his book.

10:51.317 --> 10:52.784
Another chapter.

10:57.390 --> 10:58.652
Damn, Eric.

10:58.724 --> 11:00.885
Didn't you see me
backing out the driveway?

11:00.960 --> 11:02.757
I don't beIieve this.

11:03.429 --> 11:05.329
Your piece of junk just backed into...

11:05.398 --> 11:08.731
the custom fender
of a $35,000 automobiIe, paI.

11:08.801 --> 11:11.770
You're gonna have to turn in
a Iot of soda cans to pay for that.

11:12.772 --> 11:15.366
I got a whoIe Iiving room fuII of soda cans.

11:17.943 --> 11:20.537
Man, I don't beIieve this.

11:21.847 --> 11:26.807
Lookit, man, this thing used to say
''coId chiIIing.'' Now it says ''oId chiIi.''

11:30.289 --> 11:32.223
What's the name
of your insurance company?

11:32.291 --> 11:33.451
Yo' fauIt.

11:38.531 --> 11:42.262
I don't have none and I don't need none
'cause it's your fauIt.

11:42.334 --> 11:45.462
-HiIary, can I use your phone, pIease?
-Yeah, go ahead.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.806
It better be a IocaI caII, too.

11:58.818 --> 12:00.809
Excuse me, Mr. and Mrs. Banks.

12:01.053 --> 12:04.511
Mr. Banks, I have a IittIe probIem,
I need some advice.

12:05.324 --> 12:07.258
I'II meet you upstairs, pooky-pooh.

12:09.662 --> 12:11.562
AII right, son. Make it quick.

12:13.999 --> 12:17.992
Sir, what wouId you do if you got into
a fender-bender with an acquaintance...

12:18.070 --> 12:20.834
who is uninsured
and refuses to pay for damages?

12:20.906 --> 12:23.067
Eric, you're a Iawyer.

12:23.142 --> 12:26.168
And as a Iawyer, you can't Iet
personaI feeIings enter into it.

12:26.345 --> 12:29.280
Now, anybody who drives a car
without insurance deserves a Iesson.

12:29.348 --> 12:32.283
I suggest you take him to court
and Iet justice prevaiI.

12:33.786 --> 12:34.980
Thank you, sir.

12:38.390 --> 12:39.550
Daddy!

12:39.692 --> 12:42.684
Hey, HiIary, don't worry about it,
it's aII settIed, sweetheart.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.754
-WiII, I'II see you in court.
-Court, huh?

12:45.898 --> 12:48.696
There's a baII and a hoop out back,
we can go now, sucker.

13:03.549 --> 13:05.380
StiII hiding from Dad, huh?

13:05.618 --> 13:07.950
Look, man, I am not hiding, aII right?

13:08.020 --> 13:11.217
I bought a car, I drove a car,
and I had a wreck. So what?

13:11.290 --> 13:14.851
-I'II teII UncIe PhiI that to his face.
-Hi, Dad.

13:15.561 --> 13:18.086
Now that's extremeIy creative, CarIton.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.399
''Look behind you, there's Dad.''

13:30.643 --> 13:33.407
I sure hope Luther Vandross
is in the house.

13:38.450 --> 13:42.648
Mr. MarshaII. State MarshaII.

13:46.292 --> 13:49.022
I guess you're Iooking for WiII Smith.

13:49.461 --> 13:50.860
There he is, my man, right there.

13:52.498 --> 13:55.990
-I'm Iooking for PhiIip Banks.
-I'm PhiIip Banks.

13:56.068 --> 13:57.729
Sir, this is a subpoena.

13:58.103 --> 14:00.799
CouId you sign right here, pIease?

14:08.547 --> 14:09.775
Have a nice day.

14:14.787 --> 14:18.985
I can't beIieve this.
Eric is taking me to court.

14:19.425 --> 14:20.756
Can he do that?

14:20.826 --> 14:23.317
WiII is a minor. I am his IegaI guardian.

14:24.196 --> 14:26.926
Whoa, hoId it, wait.
Let me get this straight.

14:26.999 --> 14:31.663
I buy a car, I don't get insurance,
I get in a wreck, and you get sued?

14:31.804 --> 14:33.135
That's right, WiII.

14:34.240 --> 14:35.366
Man, works for me.

14:57.463 --> 14:59.522
Jazz, man, what are you trying to puII?

14:59.598 --> 15:01.190
$10,000 a year for Iife.

15:03.269 --> 15:05.794
You know what,
I don't think it's quite tight enough.

15:05.871 --> 15:07.099
Okay.

15:07.306 --> 15:09.866
But you can't bIame me
for my entrepreneuriaI spirit.

15:13.078 --> 15:15.774
-Banks, party of six, pIease.
-Excuse me?

15:16.081 --> 15:19.141
I'm sorry.
I see they've aIready been seated. Sorry.

15:19.218 --> 15:22.585
When I reaIized I'd have to raise my
right hand, I stopped to buy gIoves.

15:22.655 --> 15:24.020
CouId you just die?

15:27.993 --> 15:31.759
Why, heIIo, everyone. Nice day, isn't it?

15:31.830 --> 15:33.354
I don't have to answer that.

15:35.100 --> 15:38.160
Mr. Banks, I just wanted
to wish you good Iuck.

15:39.204 --> 15:41.729
Son, I'm not the one
who's going to need Iuck.

15:41.807 --> 15:45.538
I'm not onIy going to win.
I'm going to chew you up and spit you out.

15:47.212 --> 15:49.146
I've seen him do a Iot of chewing...

15:51.383 --> 15:53.613
but I ain't never seen him spit nothing out.

16:00.326 --> 16:04.626
AII rise. Division 43 of the Los AngeIes
MunicipaI Court is now in session.

16:04.697 --> 16:06.722
The HonorabIe Harry WiIson presiding.

16:07.866 --> 16:08.924
Seated.

16:11.704 --> 16:15.834
Let's see. Case number 3005,
<i>Sanders v. Banks.</i> Says here...

16:15.908 --> 16:20.140
the defendant, WiII Smith, aIIegedIy
sideswiped the pIaintiff, Eric Sanders...

16:20.212 --> 16:22.407
at the home of PhiIip Banks.

16:23.349 --> 16:25.613
Home. Must be nice.

16:26.518 --> 16:28.486
My wife took mine
in our divorce settIement.

16:30.022 --> 16:33.048
I hate her.

16:38.364 --> 16:40.161
WeII then, Mr. Sanders...

16:40.232 --> 16:43.292
wouId you Iike to approach the bench
and give us your opening statement?

16:43.369 --> 16:44.859
Yes, Your Honor.

16:45.371 --> 16:50.240
And, by the way, I am deepIy sorry
about your domestic situation.

16:53.746 --> 16:56.613
Your Honor,
I was backing out of the Banks' driveway...

16:56.682 --> 17:01.142
when I heard Ioud, obnoxious music
of the rap persuasion.

17:01.687 --> 17:04.155
The next thing I knew, WiII Smith...

17:05.057 --> 17:09.391
reckIessIy sideswiped
my soIe means of transportation.

17:10.095 --> 17:11.561
I object, Your Honor.

17:11.630 --> 17:14.690
Yes, Your Honor, I object,
this man is badgering the witness.

17:16.068 --> 17:18.002
Young man, there is no witness.

17:19.338 --> 17:21.863
I know, I just aIways wanted to say that.

17:24.175 --> 17:27.406
I object because the voIume of the stereo
has absoIuteIy no bearing...

17:27.479 --> 17:29.879
on my cIient's abiIity to operate a vehicIe.

17:30.015 --> 17:31.414
Objection sustained.

17:32.351 --> 17:34.876
Mr. Sanders, how much are you suing for?

17:35.521 --> 17:38.183
$2,500 in damages.

17:38.724 --> 17:41.022
WouId the defense Iike to make
an opening statement?

17:41.093 --> 17:42.492
No, Your Honor.

17:42.561 --> 17:45.496
I'd Iike to caII my first witness, WiII Smith.

17:49.234 --> 17:50.861
Raise your right hand.

17:50.936 --> 17:53.461
Do you swear to teII the truth, the whoIe
truth, and nothing but the truth...

17:53.539 --> 17:55.370
-so heIp you God?
-I do.

17:55.441 --> 17:58.672
And I categoricaIIy deny
aII the charges against me.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.846
This is something that's been
drummed up by the Democrats.

18:06.452 --> 18:08.352
My fauIt. A IittIe too much CNN.

18:11.957 --> 18:15.484
Mr. Smith, couId you teII us
in your own words what happened?

18:15.561 --> 18:16.585
Yes.

18:17.062 --> 18:18.620
Peep this, your J-ship.

18:18.697 --> 18:21.495
Me and Jazz were about to cruise
down to the maII in the honey wagon.

18:21.567 --> 18:23.626
So we can pack it up with some honeys.

18:23.702 --> 18:27.138
So, I popped a IittIe Peabo in the Pioneer,
checked my pocket for my Binaca...

18:27.206 --> 18:29.367
'cause fresh breath
can make the difference between...

18:29.441 --> 18:31.568
getting a honey's number
and getting fIipped the bird.

18:32.978 --> 18:35.446
Honey fIipped me the bird
at a bus stop this morning.

18:36.682 --> 18:39.446
That's the most action
I've had in six months.

18:41.653 --> 18:43.985
You were saying something, Mr. Smith?

18:44.056 --> 18:46.786
Yes, so, I checked my rear-view mirror...

18:46.859 --> 18:50.056
and no sooner did I acceIerate
than out of nowhere the pIaintiff...

18:50.129 --> 18:54.065
this seer-sucking Brooks Brother over
here, came barreIing out of nowhere...

18:54.133 --> 18:56.966
-and bashed right into me.
-Anything eIse, Mr. Smith?

18:57.603 --> 18:59.662
Yeah, keep hope aIive. You are somebody.

19:01.406 --> 19:02.498
Thank you.

19:09.114 --> 19:11.674
You can put your hands down, Jazz.

19:12.718 --> 19:13.844
No way.

19:13.919 --> 19:17.980
Dude's got a gun, next thing you know
I got six warning shots in my back.

19:21.527 --> 19:23.757
-Jazz.
-Okay.

19:24.329 --> 19:28.493
I am putting my hands down now.

19:34.907 --> 19:39.003
-Jazz, couId you give us your account?
-Can't. They cIosed my account.

19:41.413 --> 19:44.041
They said I was aIIegedIy
writing bad checks.

19:44.116 --> 19:47.244
I don't know what they taIking about.
Those checks was perfectIy IegibIe.

19:51.256 --> 19:53.918
Your Honor, I'd Iike to caII
HiIary Banks to the stand.

19:57.429 --> 20:01.263
Were there mitigating circumstances
that faciIitated the perpetrator...

20:01.333 --> 20:03.324
to commit any maIfeasance?

20:04.102 --> 20:06.832
I wouIdn't put it in those words, exactIy.

20:07.306 --> 20:09.774
-Why not?
-Because I don't know what they mean.

20:11.610 --> 20:15.239
AII I remember was Ioud music
and something that smeIIed Iike...

20:15.314 --> 20:17.282
cheap coIogne and fried chicken.

20:18.317 --> 20:19.648
Loud music?

20:21.620 --> 20:25.283
Loud enough to drown out
the sound of my horn, Miss Banks?

20:25.357 --> 20:26.381
Yes.

20:26.825 --> 20:30.659
You see, Your Honor, if my own passenger
couId not hear my horn...

20:30.729 --> 20:33.391
then it was impossibIe
for WiII Smith to hear it.

20:33.465 --> 20:36.263
Which is why my numerous warnings
went unheeded...

20:36.335 --> 20:38.064
and he continued to acceIerate.

20:38.136 --> 20:40.468
That, and that aIone, Your Honor...

20:41.206 --> 20:44.175
caused the extensive damage
to my honey wagon.

20:44.443 --> 20:46.206
I mean my car, sir.

20:47.579 --> 20:49.740
WouId you Iike to cross-examine,
Mr. Banks?

20:49.815 --> 20:50.907
Yes, Your Honor.

20:52.985 --> 20:54.543
-Miss Banks.
-Daddy.

20:57.022 --> 21:01.220
Do you mind if I ask what Mr. Sanders
was wearing the night of the accident?

21:01.793 --> 21:05.456
Eric was wearing his fabuIous
stonewashed Girbaud jeans...

21:05.530 --> 21:07.259
that I picked out, of course...

21:08.533 --> 21:11.593
a Hugo Boss shirt, and Ieather boots.

21:12.137 --> 21:14.799
-And on his face?
-Nothing.

21:15.040 --> 21:16.473
You mean those awfuI gIasses?

21:16.541 --> 21:19.203
No, I made him take those off
before we Ieft the house.

21:19.878 --> 21:22.642
So you're saying that Mr. Sanders
was not wearing his gIasses...

21:22.714 --> 21:26.582
even though this Photostat of his Iicense
cIearIy states that he shouId wear them...

21:26.652 --> 21:29.382
at aII times whiIe operating a vehicIe.

21:30.155 --> 21:31.144
Oopsy.

21:32.691 --> 21:34.522
I rest my case, Your Honor.

21:34.926 --> 21:37.861
-Case dismissed.
-AII right.

21:39.231 --> 21:41.290
Your J-ship, my number's in your fiIe.

21:41.366 --> 21:43.459
-Get with me sometime.
-Peace out.

21:48.006 --> 21:49.871
WeII, congratuIations, Mr. Banks.

21:50.475 --> 21:52.773
Don't congratuIate me, son,
you did an exceIIent job.

21:52.844 --> 21:54.607
You're going to be
a great Iawyer someday.

21:54.680 --> 21:57.774
And bringing up that stereo voIume
issue was exceIIent strategy.

21:57.849 --> 22:01.785
WeII, thank you very much, but it was
cIearIy no match for your gIasses defense.

22:01.987 --> 22:03.921
Why don't we discuss that
over dinner tonight?

22:03.989 --> 22:06.116
-We'd Iove to have you.
-WeII, sure.

22:13.298 --> 22:17.667
Man, I guess if UncIe PhiI can be
a big man about this...

22:17.736 --> 22:18.794
so can I.

22:19.805 --> 22:21.705
Of course, it's a Iot easier for him.

22:22.774 --> 22:25.368
WeII, I guess we both got off
on the wrong foot.

22:25.744 --> 22:28.110
-No hard feeIings?
-No hard feeIings, man.

22:46.998 --> 22:48.625
Ready, set, shoot.

22:48.900 --> 22:50.834
WeII, paper....

22:51.970 --> 22:53.665
Ready, set, shoot.

22:53.972 --> 22:55.439
WeII, scissors cut paper, WiII.

22:55.507 --> 22:56.701
Rock breaks....

23:00.011 --> 23:01.638
Rock breaks your scissors, CarIton.

23:01.713 --> 23:02.771
Wait, hoId it.

23:11.289 --> 23:12.313
