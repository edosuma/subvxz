00:02.047 --> 00:03.336
Hey...

00:03.782 --> 00:05.352
I just caught a glimpse of our pilot,

00:05.407 --> 00:07.460
and he looks exactly like Sully.

00:07.485 --> 00:08.977
I-I think it is Sully.

00:09.032 --> 00:10.492
I think that's a woman.

00:10.517 --> 00:11.977
- No, it's a...
- Yeah.

00:12.002 --> 00:13.536
Oh, I know what you're doing.

00:13.570 --> 00:15.524
You're testing the
limits of my feminism.

00:15.549 --> 00:17.836
(chuckles) I will have
you know that I am...

00:17.861 --> 00:20.876
perfectly fine putting my life
in the hands of a female pilot.

00:20.911 --> 00:23.000
MALE VOICE: <i>Hi, folks.
This is your captain.</i>

00:23.025 --> 00:24.647
- Oh, thank God.
- Mm-hmm.

00:24.681 --> 00:26.382
<i>Our flight time to Turks and Caicos</i>

00:26.416 --> 00:28.236
<i>is six hours, 24 minutes.</i>

00:28.261 --> 00:29.895
<i>Flight attendants, prepare for takeoff.</i>

00:29.920 --> 00:31.604
- All right.
- (giggles)

00:31.629 --> 00:34.523
Time to take that special
flying medicine Ronaldo gave us.

00:34.558 --> 00:35.891
Yes, what does "cuidado" mean?

00:35.926 --> 00:37.586
I think it means "sleep
tight"? I don't know.

00:37.611 --> 00:39.018
Oh, well, cheers!

00:39.043 --> 00:40.696
- Cuidado.
- (chuckles)

00:41.502 --> 00:43.651
Mm. Okay.

00:43.676 --> 00:47.627
(plane engine running)

00:47.652 --> 00:49.151
(engine stopping)

00:49.176 --> 00:50.311
What happened?

00:50.336 --> 00:51.783
Did we land?

00:51.841 --> 00:53.432
Man, that stuff is good.

00:53.457 --> 00:55.758
<i>Bad news, folks, we have
some mechanical issues,</i>

00:55.783 --> 00:57.510
<i>and we will need to
head back to the gate.</i>

00:57.535 --> 00:58.735
Okay, any time you
head back to the gate,

00:58.760 --> 00:59.963
that means your flight's not taking off.

00:59.988 --> 01:02.088
All right, gather your things.
We're gonna need to scramble

01:02.113 --> 01:03.440
- to find another one.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Okay, Mr.
Pritchett, there is a connecting flight

01:22.839 --> 01:24.373
through Dallas that
leaves in five minutes.

01:24.407 --> 01:26.403
- You can catch it if you hurry.
- I don't want to go to Dallas.

01:26.428 --> 01:29.397
We're going to Turks and Caicos.

01:29.422 --> 01:32.078
Dallas is just where

01:33.125 --> 01:34.316
I'm sorry, I'm having a really hard time

(whispering) We took sleeping pills.

Just make your way over to gate 32.

- (mouthing) Thank you.

01:40.555 --> 01:41.817
I can... wow.

01:41.842 --> 01:43.709
- Wait, why do these say "Dallas"?
- I have no idea.

01:43.734 --> 01:46.898
Ma'am, sorry, there's
been a horrible mistake.

01:46.923 --> 01:48.873
We don't want to go to Dallas.

01:48.898 --> 01:50.109
Okay.

You need to be at gate 32 in
four minutes, do you understand?

01:58.174 --> 02:00.601
Yes. I'm not an idiot.

02:00.755 --> 02:02.889
Okay, we have to be at
gate 4 in 32 minutes.

02:02.914 --> 02:05.314
No, gate 32, write it down.

02:05.348 --> 02:06.782
Okay.

02:06.807 --> 02:08.078
Why is she so angry?

02:08.125 --> 02:09.725
Isn't it obvious? She's totally into me.

02:09.761 --> 02:11.261
- She gave me a marker. Mmm!
- Makes sense.

02:11.296 --> 02:12.701
- All right.
- Okay.

02:13.962 --> 02:16.311
- I'm just gonna follow you. Okay.
- Yeah.

02:16.367 --> 02:17.725
Wrong!

02:17.750 --> 02:20.118
I knew it. Instinct.

02:20.305 --> 02:23.040
- Okay, yes.
- Wait, no, my bag.

02:23.074 --> 02:24.325
- My bag's gone.
- Okay, okay.

02:24.350 --> 02:26.286
It has my passport in it.

Wait, that guy...

02:28.649 --> 02:30.053
he has my bag.

02:30.078 --> 02:31.447
Excuse me, sir.

02:31.482 --> 02:34.162
Nice try stealing my bag. I
see you've already painted it.

02:34.187 --> 02:36.453
Cam, it... it's back on your shoulder!

Oh, my God. You are good.

If we're gonna have any
chance of getting to Dallas

02:42.727 --> 02:44.280
and then surviving there,

02:44.305 --> 02:47.029
we are going to need hats.

02:47.054 --> 02:48.178
Hats.

02:48.203 --> 02:49.334
Hats.

02:49.359 --> 02:50.995
Excuse me, sir, sir, sir, sir,

02:51.020 --> 02:53.212
are you the proprietor
of this haberdashery?

02:53.237 --> 02:54.371
Can you point me in the direction

02:54.405 --> 02:56.459
of your finest sports caps?

02:56.484 --> 02:57.541
What team?

02:57.566 --> 02:59.233
Gay... I'm not sure why that's relevant.

02:59.277 --> 03:00.611
Oh. Okay.

03:00.645 --> 03:01.845
I'll just...

03:01.879 --> 03:03.739
Hey, I have a question for <i>you.</i>

03:03.764 --> 03:05.951
When you're outside the
workplace, do you wear hats?

03:05.976 --> 03:07.184
Or does that just kind of make you feel

03:07.218 --> 03:08.769
like you're always in the office?

03:08.794 --> 03:11.061
Oh, you know what, I think
I am going to get these.

03:11.086 --> 03:12.463
No, Mitchell, we can't...

03:12.498 --> 03:14.637
Oh, look, little girls' hats.

03:14.662 --> 03:16.334
Ooh. We should get one for Linda.

03:16.359 --> 03:18.990
- Who?
- Um, our daughter?

03:19.015 --> 03:21.409
- No, it's Lily.
- Oh, I love that name.

03:21.434 --> 03:24.069
Mitchell, why do you have
32 written on your arm?

03:24.094 --> 03:25.561
I have no idea.

03:25.586 --> 03:28.054
Maybe it's some sort of
code, or maybe it's my age.

03:28.079 --> 03:29.413
Do I look 32 to you?

03:29.438 --> 03:31.217
Tell me the truth. No,
you know what... don't.

03:31.248 --> 03:33.147
Well, if we wrote it down, it
must be something important.

03:33.172 --> 03:34.350
Hey, we should write down other stuff

03:34.375 --> 03:36.295
that seems important so we don't forget.

03:36.320 --> 03:38.778
Yeah, okay. Um, well, hats.

03:38.803 --> 03:40.124
- Hats, obviously.
- Obviously.

03:40.159 --> 03:41.392
Okay. Ah, what else?

03:41.427 --> 03:42.627
- I feel like there was a...
- A number.

03:42.661 --> 03:44.063

- He sounds mad.

03:53.690 --> 03:54.759
He does.

03:54.784 --> 03:56.360
- (normal voice) Hey.
- No, no, no.

03:56.385 --> 03:57.853
No, no, no. Cam, don't.

03:57.878 --> 03:59.844
Don't you dare. Don't... don't you dare.

03:59.869 --> 04:02.452
No, I... they just look
so soft and inviting.

04:02.477 --> 04:03.948
I-I don't think I can go on.

04:03.983 --> 04:05.133
Tell Linda I love her.

04:05.158 --> 04:06.501
No, you're gonna tell
Linda yourself, okay?

04:06.526 --> 04:08.519
I cannot go to Dallas without you.

04:08.554 --> 04:11.298
- The portions there are so big.
- Ooh.

04:11.323 --> 04:13.390
I'm just so tired. I'm so very tired.

04:13.415 --> 04:15.579
I just need to close my eyes.

04:15.604 --> 04:17.297
- Oh!
- Knock it off!

04:17.322 --> 04:19.063
- Ow!
- You're gonna suck it up.

04:19.088 --> 04:20.688
You're gonna pull your act together.

04:20.720 --> 04:23.254
And you're coming with me to gate 3232.

04:23.289 --> 04:24.456
That can't be right.

04:24.490 --> 04:25.757
We're just never gonna make it.

04:25.791 --> 04:27.092
Oh, my God. You're right.

04:27.126 --> 04:28.805
We're gonna die in this airport.

04:35.128 --> 04:37.469
- Sir, stop!
- MITCHELL: Stop!

04:37.494 --> 04:40.054
Is there a way that you
can take us to gate...

04:40.079 --> 04:42.696
- ... 32?
- 32, yeah.

04:43.157 --> 04:45.143
- I guess.
- Okay, wow.

04:45.177 --> 04:46.745
Thank you so much. You are a life saver.

04:46.779 --> 04:48.747
Please hurry. Okay.

04:48.781 --> 04:49.781
(tires screech)

04:49.815 --> 04:51.251
We're here.

04:52.532 --> 04:53.618

04:53.652 --> 04:54.860
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.

04:54.885 --> 04:56.257
Mitch and Cam. Hi!

04:56.282 --> 04:57.431
- Hi!
- Hi, we're Mitch and Cam!

04:57.456 --> 04:58.852
I'm Mitch, he's Cam.

04:58.877 --> 05:01.665
Mr. Tucker, Mr. Pritchett...
you made it just in time.

05:01.719 --> 05:03.862
- Okay. Oh, my gosh.
- Thank you.

05:03.896 --> 05:05.701
Lucy, her name is Lucy.

05:05.726 --> 05:07.627
We're coming home, Lucy!

05:13.080 --> 05:14.470
Hey, everyone,

05:14.495 --> 05:15.743
we are firing up the hologram

05:15.767 --> 05:18.047
to the Starship
Enterprise in five minutes.

05:18.072 --> 05:20.212
Be there or be square.

05:20.268 --> 05:22.785
I don't think he had to "or" that one.

05:22.810 --> 05:23.877
You know, honey, now that we're here,

05:23.911 --> 05:25.078
I'm not sure it's such a great idea

05:25.112 --> 05:26.447
to barge in on Alex.

05:26.472 --> 05:27.547
Claire, I'm worried.

05:27.582 --> 05:28.774
She's not returning texts.

05:28.799 --> 05:30.450
Her friend says she never goes out.

05:30.485 --> 05:32.462
This is the first act
of every Lifetime movie

05:32.487 --> 05:33.920
about college girl meltdowns.

05:33.955 --> 05:35.789
Yeah, but maybe we should
give her a little head's up.

05:35.823 --> 05:38.024
That's what Alicia Silverstone's
mom, Judith Light, thought

05:38.059 --> 05:39.693
in "From Straight A's
to a Straight Jacket."

05:39.727 --> 05:41.281
- (sighs)
- Trust me, this is the best way

05:41.306 --> 05:43.158
to make sure she's
not spending her nights

05:43.183 --> 05:45.454
- holed up and depressed.
- _

05:45.479 --> 05:48.337
Alex? Honey, it's Mom and Dad.

05:48.899 --> 05:51.101
Oh, well, maybe this is a good sign.

05:51.126 --> 05:53.626
Maybe she's already out with
friends, just like a normal...

05:53.651 --> 05:55.108
- Hey!
- Hey!

05:55.142 --> 05:56.556
What are <i>you guys doing here?</i>

05:56.595 --> 05:58.645
Thought we'd pop by, say hi,
maybe take you out for a bite.

05:58.679 --> 06:00.765
Unless you've already got
fun group dinner plans?

06:00.790 --> 06:02.946
- (microwave beeps)
- My burrito's ready.

06:04.356 --> 06:06.186
You're drinking?

06:06.220 --> 06:07.888
Wine helps me sleep sometimes.

06:07.922 --> 06:09.379
You know, I really wish
you guys had called.

06:09.404 --> 06:11.224
I'm so busy with school stuff right now,

06:11.259 --> 06:13.360
and this place is a mess.

06:13.394 --> 06:14.801
(meows)

06:15.512 --> 06:17.684
Aww, there you are.

06:17.709 --> 06:19.262
- You got a cat?
- It's not mine.

06:19.287 --> 06:20.791
You stole a cat?

06:20.816 --> 06:21.879
(whispering) Just like Neve Campbell

06:21.904 --> 06:23.528
- in "From Yale to Jail."
- (whispering) Oh, God.

06:23.553 --> 06:24.877
(normal voice) Honey,
are you sure you're okay?

06:24.902 --> 06:26.006
It's Saturday night.

06:26.040 --> 06:27.774
You're drinking wine in your bathrobe

06:27.808 --> 06:29.340
with a come-from-nowhere cat.

06:29.365 --> 06:30.402
What's wrong with that?

06:30.427 --> 06:32.178
Take away the cat,
and I'm basically you.

06:32.203 --> 06:33.837
- Mm.
- Honey,

06:34.051 --> 06:36.249
I know what it's like to
be an outsider in college.

06:36.284 --> 06:37.387
- Mm-hmm.
- The cool kids and I

06:37.412 --> 06:38.534
used to try to make them feel better

06:38.559 --> 06:40.246
by leaving banana bread
outside their door.

06:40.271 --> 06:42.565
We'd knock and then run
off and hide behind a bush

06:42.590 --> 06:44.624
and watch them just to see the
expression on their faces...

06:44.659 --> 06:46.191
Phil.

06:46.294 --> 06:47.473
Your dad and I are just concerned

06:47.512 --> 06:49.013
'cause you've been so distant lately.

06:49.047 --> 06:50.417
I told you I've been busy.

06:50.442 --> 06:51.876
Nobody's saying you
don't lead a full life.

06:51.910 --> 06:54.448
- You study, you make burritos.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

06:54.473 --> 06:58.549
Maybe... maybe you're just
a little lonely or depressed.

06:58.583 --> 06:59.973
I'm fine, Mom.

06:59.998 --> 07:01.727
'Cause we could always
get you back into therapy.

07:01.752 --> 07:03.430
- Yes.
- Or have you move home with us.

07:03.455 --> 07:04.989
- Uh-huh.
- God, stop.

07:05.023 --> 07:07.916
Why do you guys always just
assume I'm some depressed loser?

07:07.941 --> 07:09.927
Did it ever occur to you that
maybe I've been so distant

07:09.961 --> 07:11.996
because I've been busy with my own life?

07:12.030 --> 07:13.531
Maybe I'm doing great.

07:13.565 --> 07:16.300
Maybe I'm spending time
with someone special.

07:16.326 --> 07:18.127
- (thudding)
- CLAIRE: Ah!

07:18.152 --> 07:19.518
- Yeah.
- Whoa.

07:19.543 --> 07:21.472
- That's right.
- Ben, what are you doing?

07:21.497 --> 07:22.965
I told you to stay in there.

07:23.011 --> 07:25.558
I'm sorry... I thought you were,
like, building to a big reveal.

07:25.590 --> 07:28.338
- I wasn't.
- You and Ben and...

07:28.363 --> 07:30.402
- Honey, isn't he 50?
- He's 26.

07:30.427 --> 07:33.254
It runs in my family. I'm gonna
look like this until the day I die.

07:33.279 --> 07:34.832
So, this is why you
haven't been coming home?

07:34.857 --> 07:36.168
You've been dating your mom's assistant?

07:36.193 --> 07:38.052
- Oh, come on.
- I'm actually a marketing manager.

07:38.077 --> 07:39.083
- Unh-unh.
- You know what?

07:39.108 --> 07:40.748
This might go better for
everyone if you throw a towel on.

07:40.773 --> 07:42.140
BEN: Okay, yeah. That makes sense.

07:42.174 --> 07:44.342
Claire, co... um, could you not fire me?

07:44.376 --> 07:46.734
Ugh, how long have you
two been sneaking around?

07:46.759 --> 07:47.993
A couple of months.

07:48.018 --> 07:49.678
We took a break when
I went to San Diego.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.537
- What? We did?
- Just...

07:51.562 --> 07:53.196
Is this okay?

07:53.221 --> 07:55.362
Um, yeah, yeah, we put it in for her.

07:55.387 --> 07:56.601
- It's a feline burrito.
- Wait a minute.

07:56.626 --> 07:58.363
I knew I recognized that thing.

07:58.388 --> 08:00.267
You should know... he
brings that cat to work

08:00.292 --> 08:01.860
and apparently on dates.

08:01.894 --> 08:03.998
He thought it was time to bring together

08:04.023 --> 08:07.109
the two most special ladies in his life.

08:07.134 --> 08:09.374
Well, I cannot go to work every day

08:09.399 --> 08:11.992
and wonder why he's got that
stupid smile on his face.

08:12.017 --> 08:14.084
- Why are you making this all about you?
- (sighs)

08:14.109 --> 08:17.656
This is the first adult
relationship I've had in... ever.

08:17.681 --> 08:19.792
But it's with Ben.

08:19.817 --> 08:21.126
- (yowls)
- It's okay. It's okay.

08:21.151 --> 08:22.323
She didn't mean that.

08:22.348 --> 08:23.492
(mumbling) Claire, can I
talk to you for a second?

08:23.517 --> 08:25.618
Oh, you can agree with
me in front of everyone.

08:25.643 --> 08:27.628
Actually, I think you're
overreacting a little.

08:27.653 --> 08:29.154
- What?
- We came here thinking

08:29.188 --> 08:30.955
our daughter was in some
sort of a depression,

08:30.990 --> 08:33.101
and it turns out she's dating someone.

08:33.126 --> 08:36.095
And he's actually pretty
sweet and harmless.

08:36.120 --> 08:37.788
Are you, Ben? Are you harmless?

08:37.813 --> 08:39.336
Please don't, don't.

08:39.361 --> 08:40.371
He kissed me.

08:40.397 --> 08:42.655
- You kissed my mom?!
- You kissed my wife?!

08:42.681 --> 08:44.904
Dude, I thought I had to or
I would lose my job, okay?

08:44.929 --> 08:46.101
- That's not... mnh-mnh.
- That's for real.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.715
We were working late. It
was just the two of us.

08:47.740 --> 08:49.015
She reached over to grab

08:49.040 --> 08:50.708
- a spring roll, I guess,
- Yes...

08:50.733 --> 08:52.625
but she got right in my
face, and she whispered,

08:52.650 --> 08:54.859
"Mmm, Mama's hungry."

08:56.170 --> 08:58.359
I have to say, Claire,
this one might be on you.

08:58.417 --> 09:02.312
Like I would abuse my position
to take advantage of you

09:02.337 --> 09:04.046
and not Tony from the warehouse?

09:04.071 --> 09:06.132
- Who's Tony from the warehouse?
- Just...

09:06.157 --> 09:07.624
The kiss was an honest mistake.

09:07.649 --> 09:09.382
Maybe, but it was still a little off,

09:09.407 --> 09:11.773
like most things are with Ben.

09:11.798 --> 09:13.611
Maybe I like a little off.

09:13.636 --> 09:15.470
And that's not all he is.

09:15.495 --> 09:18.212
He's an amazing person
who somehow gets me.

09:18.237 --> 09:20.400
He's thoughtful and smart, and...

09:20.425 --> 09:22.937
I feel like I can be myself around him.

09:22.962 --> 09:26.774
And his nose does this little
wiggly thing when he sleeps.

09:26.799 --> 09:28.479
(chuckles) You watch me sleep?

09:28.514 --> 09:30.407
Dude, I watch <i>you</i> sleep.

09:31.350 --> 09:34.452
I'm really glad that this is finally out

09:34.486 --> 09:36.954
and I can tell people
how I feel about you.

09:37.256 --> 09:38.690
I really like you, Ben.

09:38.724 --> 09:40.665
Like, a lot.

09:40.690 --> 09:43.618
And I have never loved
anyone as much as you.

09:43.643 --> 09:45.642
- Don't make this weird.
- Oh, yeah.

09:45.852 --> 09:47.565
She's not sad and lonely.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.852
- No, it's so much worse.
- Look at her, Claire.

09:49.891 --> 09:52.102
Have you ever seen her look so happy?

09:53.839 --> 09:55.313
Crap.

09:55.765 --> 09:58.142
- (machinery starting)
- CROWD: 3, 2, 1.

09:58.177 --> 09:59.275
(machinery winding down)

09:59.300 --> 10:00.319
CROWD: Aw!

10:00.344 --> 10:01.923
- CLAIRE: That's my hand, Ben.
- BEN: Oh, sorry.

10:01.948 --> 10:03.368
- Mm-hmm.
- My bad.

10:04.963 --> 10:06.197
Speed it up, Manny.

10:06.222 --> 10:08.007
The movie starts in five minutes.

10:08.032 --> 10:10.099
Sorry, but I'm not going
over 20 miles an hour

10:10.124 --> 10:12.158
with this cappuccino
machine not strapped in.

10:12.183 --> 10:13.817
Once I perfect my foam art skills,

10:13.842 --> 10:15.776
my freshman dorm will
be the place to be.

10:15.801 --> 10:18.403
I think we can put off that
talk about using protection.

10:18.428 --> 10:20.774
Mm, look, there's a spot right there.

10:20.799 --> 10:23.273
Looks tight, but I'll give it a try.

10:25.610 --> 10:27.883
- You're too close to the curb.
- (sighs)

10:27.907 --> 10:29.636
- (beeping)
- You're gonna hit it.

10:29.661 --> 10:30.675
- (crunch)
- Oh!

10:30.700 --> 10:31.752
What'd I tell you?

10:31.777 --> 10:33.044
It's okay, papi, you can do it.

10:33.078 --> 10:34.746
- (car honks)
- Ugh.

10:36.315 --> 10:37.982
Go around.

10:39.858 --> 10:43.121
Oh, really? Well,
here's a bouquet of them!

10:43.800 --> 10:45.972
Okay, let's try this again.

10:45.997 --> 10:47.378
(exhales)

10:48.327 --> 10:50.089
(beeping)

10:50.114 --> 10:51.129
- (crunch)
- Ah!

10:51.154 --> 10:53.431
Ugh, okay. Get out, I'll do it.

10:53.465 --> 10:54.894
Surprise, surprise.

10:54.919 --> 10:56.105
What was that?

10:56.130 --> 10:58.388
Nothing, I was just
saying that I am surprised

10:58.413 --> 11:00.782
that you want to take
over like you usually do.

11:00.973 --> 11:02.573
- But I am not.
- What are you cagey for?

11:02.598 --> 11:03.652
- What did I do?
- (car horn honks)

11:03.677 --> 11:05.566
Okay, this spot's not happening.

11:05.611 --> 11:07.394
Well, I didn't want to say anything,

11:07.419 --> 11:10.524
but the other night, when
we were at Jeff and Sally's,

11:10.549 --> 11:12.550
I was in the middle of telling a story,

11:12.575 --> 11:15.050
you just took over and told the ending,

11:15.075 --> 11:16.321
and that was very rude.

11:16.355 --> 11:18.293
Okay, this one looks good... it's huge.

11:18.318 --> 11:20.158
That's what's bothering you?

11:20.192 --> 11:21.418
I jumped in to save you!

11:21.443 --> 11:22.738
- You were flailing.
- (beeping)

11:22.763 --> 11:25.830
You were drowning in a
sea of unnecessary details.

11:25.855 --> 11:28.035
- (crunch)
- Ah! How?!

11:28.209 --> 11:30.082
That's the way I like to tell a story.

11:30.107 --> 11:31.469
I like to paint a picture.

11:31.494 --> 11:33.271
A story should be short and simple.

11:33.296 --> 11:35.330
Don't tell me anything
I don't need to know.

11:35.355 --> 11:37.282
I am taking you on a journey.

11:37.307 --> 11:40.943
I am not teaching you
how to build a bookcase.

11:40.968 --> 11:42.635
Seriously? You saw me waiting.

11:42.660 --> 11:44.215
You couldn't tell me
you weren't leaving?

11:44.249 --> 11:45.344
You brought your own shopping bags,

11:45.369 --> 11:46.680
but you left your manners at home.

11:46.705 --> 11:48.840
I'm just saying your story
would be easier to follow

11:48.901 --> 11:50.672
if you didn't take so many side trips

11:50.697 --> 11:52.564
and you thought about
the build a little bit.

11:52.599 --> 11:54.266
You're with me on
this, aren't you, Manny?

11:54.300 --> 11:56.485
- I like Mom's stories.
- See?

11:56.510 --> 11:58.292
I'm just gonna pull in here.

11:58.877 --> 12:01.983
12 bucks? No wonder the
middle class is so angry.

12:02.008 --> 12:04.576
There's no way you would
be able to follow her story.

12:04.611 --> 12:06.678
- Yes, he would have.
- Fine. Tell it again.

12:06.713 --> 12:09.381
A couple of weeks ago, I
go to the grocery store...

12:09.415 --> 12:10.582
the one on Washington

12:10.617 --> 12:14.019
that has the tiny little
wine bar to the right.

12:14.053 --> 12:16.421
So, I come in, I'm
looking for paper towels.

12:16.456 --> 12:18.290
And I think, "Mmm,
I'm gonna treat myself

12:18.324 --> 12:20.415
"with some wine and some cheese."

12:20.440 --> 12:21.894
'Cause why not?

12:21.928 --> 12:24.749
So, I order my drink,
and when I look up,

12:24.774 --> 12:26.961
I thought I saw Sandra Bullock.

12:26.986 --> 12:28.056
Stop.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.868
Right there, you just said you
thought you saw Sandra Bullock.

12:30.893 --> 12:32.907
I already know the
ending. It wasn't her.

12:32.939 --> 12:33.946
End of story.

12:33.985 --> 12:36.208
Yeah, but you don't even
know who it really was.

12:36.242 --> 12:38.477
I know it's not Sandra
Bullock, so I'm not invested.

12:38.511 --> 12:40.414
You know, I really loved
her in that movie "Gravity."

12:40.439 --> 12:42.147
Who cares? She wasn't there.

12:42.181 --> 12:44.082
Oh, please be leaving.

12:44.117 --> 12:46.054
May I finish my story?

12:46.252 --> 12:48.120
So, I start following Sandra Bullock...

12:48.154 --> 12:49.621
<i>Not</i> Sandra Bullock.

12:49.656 --> 12:51.389
... around the grocery store.

12:51.414 --> 12:54.092
She goes first to the frozen section,

12:54.127 --> 12:57.396
then she goes to the detergent aisle.

12:57.430 --> 12:59.331
I'm thinking to myself this whole time,

12:59.365 --> 13:00.899
"I am gonna go and introduce myself,

13:00.924 --> 13:03.069
"but it has to be at the right time."

13:03.094 --> 13:04.628
So I keep following her.

13:04.662 --> 13:06.963
Eventually, she leaves the store.

13:06.998 --> 13:09.866
She goes outside, which
was actually really hot

13:09.901 --> 13:11.334
to be January, because,
remember, last year...

13:11.369 --> 13:12.869
We know the month, we know the weather,

13:12.904 --> 13:14.204
we know it's not Sandra Bullock.

13:14.238 --> 13:15.658
Are you leaving?

13:15.931 --> 13:17.874
I want your spot.

13:17.909 --> 13:19.643
Oh, please.

13:19.677 --> 13:21.744
Don't flatter yourself, lady.

13:21.769 --> 13:22.931
Manny, are you listening?

13:22.956 --> 13:24.256
No, sorry. I wasn't paying attention.

13:24.281 --> 13:26.049
Because you're not
holding his attention.

13:26.074 --> 13:27.575
And this is what I've
been talking about...

13:27.600 --> 13:29.529
too many useless details.

13:29.554 --> 13:30.859
Get on with it.

13:30.884 --> 13:34.306
So, she turns around, she
takes her sunglasses off,

13:34.331 --> 13:35.384
which was really weird,

13:35.409 --> 13:38.306
because it was the exact same pair

13:38.331 --> 13:40.605
that I bought last year that
I lost on that plane ride...

13:40.630 --> 13:42.497
Nobody cares about your sunglasses.

13:42.522 --> 13:43.922
Just get to the end.

13:43.947 --> 13:45.595
I don't want to now.

13:45.680 --> 13:47.158
The woman turns to your mother and says,

13:47.183 --> 13:48.729
"Oh, my God. Are you Salma Hayek?"

13:48.949 --> 13:51.184
- Here we go.
- I'm just trying to help you.

13:51.242 --> 13:53.088
Put on blinker, check mirrors,

13:53.113 --> 13:54.572
watch jerk steal your spot,

13:54.597 --> 13:56.994
regret quitting karate in 4th grade.

13:57.019 --> 13:58.509
You know what, Jay, this is not about

13:58.534 --> 13:59.783
who tells the best story.

13:59.808 --> 14:02.556
This is about you jumping in that night

14:02.581 --> 14:04.353
like you just wanted me to stop talking

14:04.378 --> 14:07.406
because I was embarrassing
you or something.

14:07.431 --> 14:09.159
You made me feel stupid.

14:09.193 --> 14:12.470
You think it's nothing,
but you hurt my feelings.

14:13.397 --> 14:15.892
Gloria, that's the last
thing I meant to happen.

14:15.924 --> 14:18.048
You're just saying that.
You don't really understand.

14:18.073 --> 14:19.774
No, I'm sorry.

14:20.211 --> 14:21.967
Hell, I'm the last guy
who wants to make somebody

14:21.992 --> 14:23.767
feel like they sound stupid.

14:23.861 --> 14:25.295
Did I ever tell you about the little boy

14:25.320 --> 14:27.283
from my neighborhood who stuttered?

14:27.588 --> 14:29.555
He was real self-conscious about it.

14:29.580 --> 14:31.025
What kid wouldn't be?

14:31.281 --> 14:33.361
At school, when the teacher
would ask him a question,

14:33.386 --> 14:35.283
he tried so hard to get the words out,

14:35.308 --> 14:37.020
but it just wouldn't come.

14:37.054 --> 14:38.400
Rest of the kids stared at him,

14:38.425 --> 14:40.226
which only made the stuttering worse.

14:40.251 --> 14:42.785
They'd whisper behind
his back and laugh.

14:43.094 --> 14:45.923
Finally, got to the point
when the teacher called on him

14:45.948 --> 14:48.650
to answer a question,
even if he knew the answer,

14:48.675 --> 14:50.330
he'd just say, "I don't know."

14:51.147 --> 14:53.236
Then the teacher would
shake his head and say,

14:53.261 --> 14:55.662
"Next time, study harder, Jay."

14:56.009 --> 14:57.978
You were that little kid?

14:58.451 --> 14:59.918
So sad.

14:59.943 --> 15:01.650
That must have been very hard for you.

15:01.675 --> 15:02.908
It was.

15:03.110 --> 15:04.431
We're parked.

15:05.484 --> 15:07.571
Okay, the movie's about to start.

15:07.596 --> 15:08.789
Let's go.

15:12.214 --> 15:14.534
Man, I haven't thought
about that in years.

15:14.559 --> 15:16.571
That was really moving.

15:17.724 --> 15:20.297
(whispering) 'Cause that's
how you tell a story.

15:26.134 --> 15:28.165
Hi, could you bring
out the birthday cake

15:28.190 --> 15:29.252
in like five, minutes?

15:29.277 --> 15:30.626
Sure, do you want the
whole song and everything?

15:30.651 --> 15:31.650
Oh, that would be great.

15:31.675 --> 15:32.900
I only ask because we
don't <i>love</i> doing it.

15:32.925 --> 15:34.338
Okay, thanks.

15:34.721 --> 15:35.721
Hey.

15:35.746 --> 15:38.271
So, birthday boy, how you feeling?

15:38.296 --> 15:40.361
Um, a little nervous, actually.

15:40.386 --> 15:41.420
Why?

15:41.455 --> 15:43.158
Uh, well...

15:43.821 --> 15:45.299
Oh, my God.

15:45.893 --> 15:47.360
Haley, when I woke up this morning,

15:47.385 --> 15:49.502
I just had this feeling.

15:49.527 --> 15:50.745
And I know this is sudden,

15:50.770 --> 15:53.180
but like any mid-to-large
market weatherman,

15:53.205 --> 15:54.567
I trust my instincts.

15:54.601 --> 15:56.869
And it might have something
to do with turning 45,

15:56.904 --> 15:59.307
but today my instincts told
me not to wait another second

15:59.332 --> 16:02.065
to spend the rest of my
life with the woman I love.

16:03.377 --> 16:05.940
Haley Gwendolyn Dunphy,

16:05.965 --> 16:07.572
will you marry me?

16:09.883 --> 16:10.983
Yes.

16:11.018 --> 16:12.652
- Yes, I'll marry you.
- Really? You will?

16:12.686 --> 16:14.282
- Yeah!
- Oh!

16:14.500 --> 16:17.032
It just feels right, you know?
I don't want to over-think it.

16:17.057 --> 16:19.201
That's what I love about you.
You don't over-think anything.

16:19.226 --> 16:20.298
Aww.

16:20.323 --> 16:22.438
Oh, you've made me the
happiest man in the world.

16:22.463 --> 16:24.204
I don't know how to say this
without sounding superficial,

16:24.229 --> 16:25.415
but I need a closer look at this ring.

16:25.440 --> 16:27.180
Yeah, sit down, sit down.

16:27.205 --> 16:29.039
- (giggles)
- It was my grandmother's.

16:29.064 --> 16:30.731
She hid it in her
hollowed-out wooden foot

16:30.756 --> 16:31.835
during the Great Depression.

16:31.860 --> 16:34.261
So crazy, my grandmother's on Snapchat.

16:34.286 --> 16:35.620
It's beautiful.

16:35.645 --> 16:37.047
I didn't ruin the surprise, did I?

16:37.072 --> 16:38.587
I mean, I was trying to
act normal through dinner.

16:38.612 --> 16:40.336
I just couldn't hide how nervous I was.

16:40.361 --> 16:42.925
It's how I imagine fans feel
when they come up and meet me.

16:42.950 --> 16:44.751
No, I didn't expect it at all.

16:44.776 --> 16:46.406
I just thought you were
nervous because the light's

16:46.431 --> 16:47.531
on the right side of your face.

16:47.556 --> 16:49.094
Yeah. Oh, look at me...

16:49.119 --> 16:50.828
- I can't stop smiling.
- Yeah!

16:50.853 --> 16:52.658
Usually I like to save
my smiles for on-camera

16:52.692 --> 16:54.226
because they come off
more real that way.

16:54.261 --> 16:55.728
- Oh, yeah.
- But this is worth it.

16:55.762 --> 16:57.516
- Mm.
- (thunder clap)

16:58.512 --> 16:59.812
- That's odd.
- What's wrong?

16:59.837 --> 17:01.946
It's raining. I didn't predict that.

17:01.971 --> 17:04.109
- I called for clear skies tonight.
- Hmm.

17:04.135 --> 17:06.785
Ooh, should we order some
champagne to celebrate?

17:06.810 --> 17:08.367
I can't believe my forecast was wrong.

17:08.394 --> 17:10.127
Oh, don't beat yourself up about it.

17:10.153 --> 17:12.487
If it helps, my weather app
didn't predict rain either.

17:12.512 --> 17:14.148
- Your what?
- Nothing.

17:14.355 --> 17:16.089
My God, look at those winds.

17:16.114 --> 17:18.763
They must register at least
a 10 on the Beaufort Scale.

17:18.789 --> 17:20.890
Think of all the sun roofs left open.

17:21.394 --> 17:24.127
Think of all the freshly
blown-out hair de-volumizing.

17:24.161 --> 17:26.050
- How could I not see this coming?
- Rainer.

17:26.075 --> 17:27.728
Is this the only thing
I was off about today?

17:27.752 --> 17:29.245
(chuckling) What do you mean?

17:29.270 --> 17:32.177
Well, let's face it, Haley.
I did not think this through.

17:32.202 --> 17:33.464
I mean, where are we gonna live?

17:33.489 --> 17:36.160
My place only has one walk-in
closet, which would stay mine.

17:36.185 --> 17:38.517
And how's my daughter gonna
feel about us getting married?

17:38.542 --> 17:39.902
Are you gonna want to have children?

17:39.927 --> 17:41.527
Can I even <i>have more children?</i>

17:41.552 --> 17:43.319
(whispering) I've spent a
lot of time in tanning beds.

17:43.344 --> 17:45.813
Um, I think you're spinning a little.

17:45.894 --> 17:49.027
Look, sometimes when I'm
reorganizing my closet,

17:49.052 --> 17:51.697
I feel overwhelmed, like I'm
never gonna get through it all.

17:51.722 --> 17:55.267
So I force myself to look at
things in smaller sections.

17:55.292 --> 17:57.594
I arrange five pairs of shoes at a time.

17:57.628 --> 17:59.762
12 hours later, I'm done.

17:59.797 --> 18:01.198
So, that's what we'll do.

18:01.223 --> 18:03.099
We'll take things five years at a time.

18:03.133 --> 18:04.968
- In five years, I'll be 50.
- What?

18:05.002 --> 18:06.769
What did you think 45 plus 5 was?

18:06.804 --> 18:08.471
Well, until today, you were 44,

18:08.505 --> 18:10.773
which I had basically
convinced myself was 40,

18:10.808 --> 18:13.402
and now suddenly we're talking
about 50, which is basically 60.

18:13.427 --> 18:14.972
Wait, wait. Why are <i>you</i> panicking?

18:14.997 --> 18:16.878
I'm the one who can't
mess up another marriage.

18:16.903 --> 18:18.924
I mean, you mess up the first one, fine.

18:18.949 --> 18:20.722
It's a mulligan. But
the second one fails,

18:20.747 --> 18:22.452
and suddenly <i>I'm</i> the problem.

18:22.486 --> 18:24.454
I lose my chance at
being the spokesperson

18:24.488 --> 18:26.255
for Blue Monsoon Korean Energy Drink.

18:26.290 --> 18:27.589
Let's just take a breath.

18:27.614 --> 18:29.014
It's natural to freak out a little bit.

18:29.039 --> 18:31.519
We're making a lifetime commitment.

18:31.544 --> 18:33.541
We're going to be together forever.

18:33.566 --> 18:35.565
(thunder crashes)

18:35.599 --> 18:37.277
Just you and me.

18:37.302 --> 18:38.581
Forever.

18:39.065 --> 18:40.517
You just said that.

18:41.211 --> 18:42.848
(laughing) I know.

18:42.873 --> 18:45.534
Because... because it's great.

18:45.559 --> 18:46.972
That's what every girl wants, right?

18:46.997 --> 18:49.730
I mean, sure, I'm still really
young and there's obviously

18:49.755 --> 18:52.124
so much more I thought I'd
do before I tied myself down

18:52.149 --> 18:53.800
to one person for the rest of my life.

18:53.825 --> 18:56.360
But does anyone ever truly
feel ready to get married?

18:56.385 --> 18:57.675
I mean, probably.

18:57.700 --> 18:59.531
- Haley.
- But it's not like I'm dying.

18:59.556 --> 19:01.224
I just won't be single anymore.

19:01.258 --> 19:02.759
I'll won't ever go
on a first date again.

19:02.793 --> 19:04.011
I won't ever have a first kiss.

19:04.036 --> 19:05.206
I won't ever dance near a deejay booth

19:05.231 --> 19:06.323
hoping someone will like what they see

19:06.348 --> 19:07.581
and offer me a ride home.

19:07.606 --> 19:09.800
(whimpers) Oh, my... is it, is it me...

19:09.825 --> 19:11.467
or is it just crazy hot in here?

19:11.502 --> 19:13.136
Can somebody open a window, please?

19:13.170 --> 19:14.871
No, no, they can't because,
as I did not predict,

19:14.905 --> 19:15.972
it's raining outside.

19:16.006 --> 19:17.972
Ew, my finger is swelling up.

19:17.997 --> 19:20.661
Oh, why is your grandmother's
Depression ring so tight?

19:20.686 --> 19:22.253
Give me that butter.

19:22.680 --> 19:23.913
Here, let me help you with that.

19:23.947 --> 19:24.977
Ugh.

19:25.002 --> 19:26.245
I got it. Ow!

19:26.270 --> 19:27.495
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

19:27.520 --> 19:29.041
Nope, it's okay. I'm fine.

19:29.066 --> 19:30.767
At least the ring came off.

19:30.792 --> 19:32.126
Ow.

19:32.174 --> 19:33.541
Yeah, um,

19:33.972 --> 19:35.386
feels better.

19:38.776 --> 19:40.612
Look, um...

19:41.989 --> 19:43.730
maybe you're right.

19:44.935 --> 19:48.771
Maybe we should rethink
this whole marriage thing.

19:49.027 --> 19:51.113
I don't remember saying that.

19:51.230 --> 19:53.176
It's clear you're having doubts.

19:53.210 --> 19:54.855
We both are.

19:54.880 --> 19:57.455
Let's just keep dating
and see where it goes.

19:57.481 --> 19:58.748
I don't want to do that.

19:58.782 --> 20:01.722
I mean, I... clearly, I've
had some commitment issues,

20:01.747 --> 20:03.996
and I know I had a
momentary freak out there,

20:04.021 --> 20:07.511
but I was... I had no idea that you w...

20:08.222 --> 20:09.552
Haley, I know it's unfair.

20:09.577 --> 20:10.972
I guess I was just hoping
you'd be sure enough

20:10.997 --> 20:12.471
for the both of us.

20:12.496 --> 20:13.996
You're right.

20:14.031 --> 20:15.465
It isn't fair.

20:17.735 --> 20:19.475
You're really giving this back?

20:21.305 --> 20:22.890
Just for now.

20:24.208 --> 20:25.842
Haley, I'm 45 years old.

20:25.876 --> 20:28.811
I-I don't want to just date
and see where things go.

20:28.836 --> 20:30.613
That's not where I am in my life.

20:30.647 --> 20:32.093
What are you saying?

20:32.757 --> 20:34.617
Well, I think we're both saying it.

20:34.651 --> 20:36.257
- ♪ Ha... ♪
- No, no, don't.

20:36.282 --> 20:37.482
Oh, good.

20:39.203 --> 20:40.837
Do you want to blow out the candles?

20:46.685 --> 20:47.927
(blows)

20:50.078 --> 20:51.701
(snoring)

20:51.726 --> 20:53.091
Sir?

20:53.123 --> 20:54.132
Sir?

20:54.168 --> 20:56.208
- Wh-what happened?
- Are we in Dallas yet?

20:56.233 --> 20:58.201
No, we've left Dallas.
We're in Turks and Caicos.

20:58.235 --> 21:00.203
- We need to clean the plane.
- What?

21:00.237 --> 21:01.705
Do you remember being in Dallas?

21:01.739 --> 21:03.327
No, we must have slept through it.

21:03.352 --> 21:05.785
- You're wearing a cowboy hat.
- So are you.

21:05.810 --> 21:06.810
What is this?

21:06.835 --> 21:08.741
I don't think we're
supposed to have that.

21:08.766 --> 21:09.813
(clicking sound)

21:09.847 --> 21:11.022
(beeping)

21:11.428 --> 21:13.334
So, it appears I've gotten a piercing.

21:13.359 --> 21:14.526
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

21:14.560 --> 21:15.648
"Murray."

21:15.673 --> 21:17.669
- Why does your arm say "Murray"?
- (yelps)

21:17.694 --> 21:19.280
Who... whose dog is this?

21:19.305 --> 21:20.663
What do you mean "whose dog"?

21:20.688 --> 21:22.116
You refused to board without him.

21:22.141 --> 21:23.341
I did?

21:23.569 --> 21:25.820
Okay, well, let's go.

21:25.844 --> 21:29.046
I don't remember my
bag being this heavy.

21:29.408 --> 21:30.663
Uh-oh.
