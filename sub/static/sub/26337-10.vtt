00:04.659 --> 00:08.387
NARRATOR: Previously,
on "Hell's Kitchen,"

00:08.491 --> 00:09.975
the chefs were
challenged to cook

00:10.079 --> 00:11.183
traditional Chinese cuisine.

00:11.287 --> 00:12.495
Oh, shit.

00:12.598 --> 00:14.048
It's still moving.
- What are you doing?

00:14.152 --> 00:15.015
Duck three ways.

00:15.118 --> 00:16.085
Three ways?

00:16.188 --> 00:18.225
I'm not going to
quack under pressure.

00:18.328 --> 00:19.502
NARRATOR: Judging
the competition

00:19.605 --> 00:22.746
was renowned chef and Beijingnative, Shirley Chung.

00:22.850 --> 00:26.164
Now we have to follow throughwith actual Chinese cuisine.

00:26.267 --> 00:28.442
NARRATOR: And the chefsquickly realized this wasn't

00:28.545 --> 00:29.995
going to be a walk in the park.

00:30.099 --> 00:31.583
It's very sweet.

00:31.686 --> 00:33.102
It's not coming
together as a whole.

00:33.205 --> 00:34.517
I think it's a little
bit on the dry side.

00:34.620 --> 00:37.968
TREVOR: She's really nit
picking every detail.

00:38.072 --> 00:39.867
NARRATOR: Thankfully for
the blue team, Ariel's

00:39.970 --> 00:42.007
duck with plum sauce was a hit.

00:42.111 --> 00:42.973
The flavor is really good.

00:43.077 --> 00:43.940
Thank you, Chef.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.424
NARRATOR: And
while Jose's prawns

00:45.528 --> 00:47.771
sparked some laughs
from his teammates--

00:47.875 --> 00:49.739
Suck out the juice
out of the head.

00:49.842 --> 00:51.672
I'm going to suck the head.

00:51.775 --> 00:53.743
NARRATOR: --it failed
to impress the judges--

00:53.846 --> 00:55.400
It's a little bit
difficult to eat.

00:55.503 --> 00:57.057
NARRATOR: --leading to
another victory for--

00:57.160 --> 00:58.334
The blue team.
CHEF RAMSAY: Blue team.

00:58.437 --> 00:59.231
- Thank you, Chef.
- Yeah.

00:59.335 --> 01:00.370
Yes.

01:00.474 --> 01:02.683
NARRATOR: --and a fabuloustrip to Las Vegas.

01:02.786 --> 01:04.616
Notice the marquee
at Caesar's Palace.

01:04.719 --> 01:07.101
One day that marquee is
going to say, "Welcome

01:07.205 --> 01:10.104
HK 18 winner Ariel Fox."

01:10.208 --> 01:11.312
NARRATOR: At dinner service--

01:11.416 --> 01:12.210
Walking lamb first.

01:12.313 --> 01:13.107
Walking to carbonara.

01:13.211 --> 01:14.212
Yeah?

01:14.315 --> 01:15.489
NARRATOR: --the blue
team danced their way

01:15.592 --> 01:17.318
to a near flawless service.

01:17.422 --> 01:18.319
Ladies, well done.

01:18.423 --> 01:19.665
Thank you, Chef.

01:19.769 --> 01:21.667
NARRATOR: The same could notbe said in the red kitchen.

01:21.771 --> 01:23.428
CHEF RAMSAY: Hey, red
team, this is painful.

01:23.531 --> 01:24.636
Who just gave me them?

01:24.739 --> 01:26.051
This is a joke.

01:26.155 --> 01:28.985
NARRATOR: --as Trevor and Josemassacred the fish station.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.538
CHEF RAMSAY: I am
at a loss for words

01:30.642 --> 01:32.816
NARRATOR: --and Scotley
mangled the Wellingtons.

01:32.920 --> 01:34.646
CHEF RAMSAY: Wellington,
beautifully cooked,

01:34.749 --> 01:36.510
except that's from
the blue team.

01:36.613 --> 01:37.614
NARRATOR: The red team lost--

01:37.718 --> 01:38.857
Get out.

01:38.960 --> 01:40.721
NARRATOR: --and had plentyof blame to go around.

01:40.824 --> 01:41.894
Your sandwich was fucked up.

01:41.998 --> 01:43.448
We pulled them outbecause you weren't ready.

01:43.551 --> 01:44.518
- No excuses, man.
- All right.

01:44.621 --> 01:45.553
All right I'm not.

01:45.657 --> 01:46.554
Damn.

01:46.658 --> 01:48.004
NARRATOR: At
elimination, Chef Ramsay

01:48.108 --> 01:52.146
called up Trevor, Scotley, andJose, ultimately eliminating--

01:52.250 --> 01:53.561
Scotley.

01:53.665 --> 01:56.012
NARRATOR: --ending his chancesof becoming the executive chef

01:56.116 --> 01:58.048
at Gordon Ramsay'sHell's Kitchen restaurant

01:58.152 --> 01:59.878
at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.

02:03.330 --> 02:05.953
And now, the continuation
of Hell's Kitchen.

02:06.056 --> 02:06.885
CHEF RAMSAY: Fuck off.

02:10.923 --> 02:12.960
Scotley, it was his
time to go tonight.

02:13.063 --> 02:15.135
I think Jose's a
very strong chef.

02:15.238 --> 02:17.654
I know he's going to bounce backand just push forward and have

02:17.758 --> 02:19.725
some good dinner services.

02:19.829 --> 02:20.933
You're going to bounce back.

02:21.037 --> 02:22.107
Today was a fucking day.

02:22.211 --> 02:23.177
You're still here.

02:23.281 --> 02:24.454
Tomorrow's another
day to prove yourself.

02:24.558 --> 02:25.352
Yeah.

02:32.566 --> 02:34.119
Bret, how many kids you got?

02:34.223 --> 02:35.431
I got a 10-year-old daughter.

02:35.534 --> 02:36.432
Oh, just the dau-- oh, OK.

02:36.535 --> 02:39.089
--and a 3-year-old
stepdaughterish,

02:39.193 --> 02:40.229
I guess you could say.
- Oh.

02:40.332 --> 02:41.126
OK.

02:41.230 --> 02:42.955
My girl's daughters is three.

02:43.059 --> 02:44.854
I'm sure there's more outthere that I don't know about.

02:44.957 --> 02:47.615
They don't want to tell meabout, to be honest with you.

02:47.719 --> 02:50.446
No, maybe like, six.

02:50.549 --> 02:52.379
I've improved
myself quite a bit.

02:52.482 --> 02:55.071
Back in the day, women wouldthrow themselves at me.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.349
But I live a different
lifestyle now,

02:57.453 --> 02:59.109
and I love my girl at home, man.

02:59.213 --> 03:00.041
It's just the way it is.

03:00.145 --> 03:01.353
That's real.

03:01.457 --> 03:02.251
I'm good.

03:02.354 --> 03:04.839
Man, I like this one a lot.

03:04.943 --> 03:06.013
I love her.

03:06.116 --> 03:07.152
Wow.

03:07.256 --> 03:08.705
It still sounds weird
coming out of my mouth.

03:08.809 --> 03:14.849
I loved the woman
before, but not really.

03:14.953 --> 03:16.126
JOSE: Not really?

03:16.230 --> 03:17.818
Yeah, but like it's weirdbecause then I'm like,

03:17.921 --> 03:21.339
you know, I ran through
so many fucking broads.

03:21.442 --> 03:56.063
[theme music]

03:56.166 --> 03:57.271
HEATHER: Come on, blue.

03:57.375 --> 03:58.997
CHEF: As fast as possible.

03:59.100 --> 04:00.101
KANAE: As fast as possible.

04:00.205 --> 04:07.074
[music playing]

04:07.177 --> 04:08.075
Bonjourno.

04:08.178 --> 04:09.904
ALL: Bonjourno, Chef.

04:10.008 --> 04:11.975
As you can see,
I've transformed

04:12.079 --> 04:16.601
the dining room into hisbeautiful, cozy Italian cafe.

04:16.704 --> 04:18.223
MARINO: Thank you.

04:19.224 --> 04:20.156
Grazie.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.572
Italian challenge?

04:22.676 --> 04:23.815
Forget about it.

04:23.918 --> 04:26.611
My team is guaranteed
victory on this one.

04:26.714 --> 04:27.819
Thank you

04:27.922 --> 04:29.199
I'd like you
all to think about

04:29.303 --> 04:31.857
your perfect Italian meal.

04:31.961 --> 04:32.996
How would it start?

04:33.100 --> 04:34.446
Starting with wine, Chef.

04:34.550 --> 04:35.758
Oh.

04:35.861 --> 04:37.760
Bret, give me a
little excitement

04:37.863 --> 04:38.761
behind the pasta dish.

04:38.864 --> 04:40.935
Classic pomodoro, Chef.

04:41.039 --> 04:44.767
Maybe a gnocchi dish,
lobster tagliatelle.

04:44.870 --> 04:45.664
Heather?

04:45.768 --> 04:46.596
Yes.

04:46.700 --> 04:48.322
How would you end the meal?

04:48.426 --> 04:49.289
Tiramisu.

04:49.392 --> 04:50.428
Classic.

04:50.531 --> 04:51.877
Love it.
Kanae?

04:51.981 --> 04:54.535
Gelato.

04:54.639 --> 04:56.744
Did you know that
Marino's family in Italy

04:56.848 --> 04:59.885
are the makers of
the finest gelato?

04:59.989 --> 05:14.383
[speaking italian]

05:14.486 --> 05:15.901
Yeah, Marino.

05:16.005 --> 05:17.869
Look at those shorts, man.

05:17.972 --> 05:18.939
Short shorts.

05:19.042 --> 05:20.250
CHEF RAMSAY: Do you
shave those legs?

05:20.354 --> 05:21.251
No, I don't.
Naturel.

05:21.355 --> 05:22.149
CHEF RAMSAY: Naturel.

05:25.497 --> 05:27.603
Holy crap.

05:27.706 --> 05:29.087
I love Marino.

05:29.190 --> 05:31.158
I feel like he's
been saving those,

05:31.261 --> 05:33.712
and he's just been waitingfor the perfect moment

05:33.816 --> 05:36.405
to bust them out.

05:36.508 --> 05:38.407
Let's start off with
chocolate and vanilla.

05:38.510 --> 05:39.442
Here we are.

05:39.546 --> 05:40.340
Grazie, Marino.

05:40.443 --> 05:41.962
[speaking italian].

05:42.065 --> 05:42.894
Ladies.

05:42.997 --> 05:44.344
- Thank you.
- Chef?

05:44.447 --> 05:45.241
Yes, please.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.933
[speaking italian]

05:48.037 --> 05:51.074
Even a simple chocolateor vanilla tastes amazing.

05:51.178 --> 05:51.972
Right?

05:52.075 --> 05:53.491
Mm-hmm.

05:53.594 --> 05:56.770
There are so many other
great flavors it takes.

05:56.873 --> 05:58.668
And we're going to
do that right now.

05:58.772 --> 06:06.607
But first, you'll need these.

06:06.711 --> 06:08.057
Oh, yes.

06:08.160 --> 06:10.404
It is the blind taste test.

06:10.508 --> 06:11.301
Excited?

06:11.405 --> 06:12.648
ALL: Yes.

06:12.751 --> 06:14.684
I have nightmares
about this challenge.

06:14.788 --> 06:16.962
I did so horrible the last time.

06:17.066 --> 06:18.723
But this time around,
I'm ready for it.

06:18.826 --> 06:20.138
Right.
Listen carefully.

06:20.241 --> 06:24.314
Today, each of you will taste avariety of stunning gelatinous

06:24.418 --> 06:26.593
infused with the flavor
of the single ingredient

06:26.696 --> 06:28.249
that you should identify.

06:28.353 --> 06:31.080
The team that correctlyidentifies the most ingredients

06:31.183 --> 06:33.462
wins the challenge.

06:33.565 --> 06:36.499
If your teammate getstwo wrong, your teammates

06:36.603 --> 06:42.125
get blasted with spaghetti.

06:42.229 --> 06:45.508
If your teammate getsthree wrong, well, come on,

06:45.612 --> 06:46.647
what goes well with spaghetti?

06:47.648 --> 06:48.580
Marinara sauce.

06:48.684 --> 06:49.788
Thank you, Ariel.

06:49.892 --> 06:52.204
Marinara sauce will
pour from the ceiling.

06:52.308 --> 06:53.447
Oh, no.

06:53.551 --> 06:56.208
If you get four wrong, whichI doubt any of you will,

06:56.312 --> 06:58.728
how do we finish off theperfect spaghetti marinara?

06:58.832 --> 06:59.902
Some Parmesan cheese?

07:00.005 --> 07:02.560
Parmesan cheese,
that's a great idea.

07:02.663 --> 07:03.837
Thanks, Jose.

07:03.940 --> 07:07.116
I have never did a blindtaste testing ever in my life,

07:07.219 --> 07:10.153
so I feel sorry for whoeveris sitting in the hot seat.

07:10.257 --> 07:11.258
Let's go.

07:11.361 --> 07:13.467
Trevor, and from the
blue team, Heather.

07:13.571 --> 07:14.399
Yes, Chef.

07:14.503 --> 07:17.540
In the hot seat,
Jose and Kanae.

07:17.644 --> 07:18.438
Let's go.

07:22.269 --> 07:23.926
KANAE: I just did my
cute little ponytails.

07:24.029 --> 07:26.376
I don't want to get
them all messed up.

07:26.480 --> 07:27.274
Kanae, you good?

07:27.377 --> 07:28.724
Yes, Chef.

07:28.827 --> 07:30.001
Ready?
OK.

07:30.104 --> 07:31.347
Let's go.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.280
Let's start off
with something easy.

07:33.383 --> 07:34.626
Carrots.

07:34.730 --> 07:39.217
Nice, easy carrot gelato.

07:45.016 --> 07:46.327
Banana.

07:46.431 --> 07:47.984
Wrong.

07:48.088 --> 07:50.262
Banana?

07:50.366 --> 07:51.540
Sweet potato, Chef?

07:51.643 --> 07:52.713
One wrong each.

07:53.749 --> 07:54.543
Carrot.

07:54.646 --> 07:55.509
Shit.

07:55.613 --> 07:59.030
Number two, mango

07:59.133 --> 07:59.962
Delicious.

08:03.517 --> 08:06.382
He's like a kid right now.

08:06.486 --> 08:07.625
- Mango, Chef?
- Correct.

08:07.728 --> 08:08.522
Well done.

08:08.626 --> 08:09.765
Yes.

08:09.868 --> 08:10.938
Stand by, Jose.

08:11.042 --> 08:13.976
It's coming, Chef.

08:15.460 --> 08:16.772
Lime.

08:16.875 --> 08:18.325
Mango.

08:18.428 --> 08:19.326
I should know mango.

08:19.429 --> 08:21.017
I cook with mango
all the damn time.

08:21.121 --> 08:23.951
At this point, I'm just
hoping that I get one.

08:24.055 --> 08:25.401
I'm in the mood
for some pasta.

08:25.505 --> 08:26.298
Let it rip.

08:31.131 --> 08:31.890
CHEF RAMSAY: Nice ginger.

08:36.412 --> 08:39.139
This is an easy one.

08:39.242 --> 08:40.036
Cinnamon.

08:43.488 --> 08:44.489
Wrong.

08:44.593 --> 08:46.733
Nothing better than
pasta with red sauce.

08:46.836 --> 08:47.906
Nice and slowly.

08:48.010 --> 08:48.804
Oh my god.

08:52.808 --> 08:55.396
Oh shit.

08:55.500 --> 08:56.328
Fucking Trevor.

09:00.022 --> 09:01.230
Yikes.

09:01.333 --> 09:03.163
I'll take the dry spaghettiwith a little olive

09:03.266 --> 09:06.891
oil on it any day over everyorifice full of tomato sauce.

09:06.994 --> 09:08.858
That's for sure.

09:08.962 --> 09:09.859
Coriander, Chef.

09:09.963 --> 09:11.896
Coriander.

09:11.999 --> 09:12.828
Fuck you.

09:12.931 --> 09:14.105
Brace yourself, Kanae.

09:14.208 --> 09:15.037
OK.

09:15.140 --> 09:15.900
CHEF RAMSAY: Let's go.

09:20.076 --> 09:20.939
KANAE: Damn, that was hard.

09:25.392 --> 09:26.186
Number four.

09:26.289 --> 09:28.947
Tomatoes Easy.

09:29.051 --> 09:30.017
Kanae, stand by.

09:30.121 --> 09:31.536
Oh my god.

09:31.640 --> 09:34.919
Come on, dump tomatosauce on this bitch, man.

09:35.022 --> 09:35.816
Tomato, Chef.

09:35.920 --> 09:36.748
Tomato.

09:36.852 --> 09:37.749
Way to go.

09:37.853 --> 09:38.681
KANAE: Yes!

09:38.785 --> 09:40.683
I did not want any
spaghetti sauce.

09:40.787 --> 09:43.755
My hair is safe.

09:43.859 --> 09:44.653
OK, Trev.

09:44.756 --> 09:45.550
Here we go.

09:48.173 --> 09:49.036
Pea.

09:49.140 --> 09:50.486
Pea?

09:50.590 --> 09:53.075
Stand by with the
grater, please.

09:53.178 --> 09:53.972
Wrong.

09:54.076 --> 09:55.905
Survey says, [buzzer].

09:56.009 --> 09:58.045
You're wrong again.

09:58.149 --> 10:00.082
[inaudible] you should havehad nicotine as a flavor.

10:00.185 --> 10:01.531
You have got that one.

10:01.635 --> 10:03.050
No more smoking for you guys.

10:03.154 --> 10:04.880
Let's go.

10:04.983 --> 10:08.331
Pass the cheese.

10:08.435 --> 10:11.334
[inaudible]

10:11.438 --> 10:12.232
It's like slow.

10:12.335 --> 10:13.751
How cute.

10:13.854 --> 10:15.028
Oh, man.

10:15.131 --> 10:15.925
Off we go.

10:16.029 --> 10:17.962
Tomato.

10:18.065 --> 10:21.344
Hey, what's up?

10:21.448 --> 10:22.414
I can't hear you.

10:22.518 --> 10:24.589
You can't taste, either.

10:24.693 --> 10:26.280
ARIEL: He can't taste that shit.

10:26.384 --> 10:28.317
Look what you
did you teammate.

10:28.420 --> 10:29.767
Oh my god.

10:29.870 --> 10:30.871
I mean I'm drenched.

10:30.975 --> 10:33.943
My pants, my socks,
my fucking underwears.

10:34.047 --> 10:36.152
I don't even want mentionwhat else is fucking sitting

10:36.256 --> 10:37.050
in tomato sauce right now.

10:39.846 --> 10:41.192
The gelato threw me off,Chef.

10:41.295 --> 10:42.365
Oh for four?

10:42.469 --> 10:43.401
It's fucking embarrassing.

10:43.504 --> 10:44.747
It's harder than it looks.

10:44.851 --> 10:46.991
I have a good palate, butI don't walk around in life

10:47.094 --> 10:49.096
with a blindfold in mypocket, and then just walk in

10:49.200 --> 10:50.650
on the grocery store
and start popping

10:50.753 --> 10:53.135
stuff in my mouth to seeif I can guess what it is.

10:53.238 --> 10:54.170
Here we go.

10:54.274 --> 10:56.725
Up next, Motto and
Mia, the two M's.

10:56.828 --> 10:57.726
Let's go.

10:57.829 --> 10:59.106
Come on, Mia.

10:59.210 --> 11:02.523
Mia has had the best performanceout of anybody in challenges

11:02.627 --> 11:04.077
this whole competition.

11:04.180 --> 11:06.320
So she should have
this in the bag.

11:06.424 --> 11:07.183
So let's start off.

11:07.287 --> 11:08.081
Let's go easy, shall we?

11:11.567 --> 11:14.397
Delicious.

11:14.501 --> 11:16.089
Banana, Chef.

11:16.192 --> 11:17.262
Good job, Motto.

11:17.366 --> 11:18.160
Banana?

11:18.263 --> 11:21.163
Yes.

11:21.266 --> 11:22.164
Pickle.

11:22.267 --> 11:23.648
Oh my gosh.

11:27.687 --> 11:28.480
Pickle?

11:28.584 --> 11:29.723
Two for two.

11:29.827 --> 11:32.415
Damn, Motto, you got
a banging-ass palete.

11:32.519 --> 11:34.038
Pickle.

11:34.141 --> 11:35.833
Good job Pepper.

11:39.181 --> 11:40.389
Black peppers, Chef?

11:40.492 --> 11:41.908
Good man.

11:42.011 --> 11:42.874
Black pepper.

11:42.978 --> 11:43.772
Well done.

11:43.875 --> 11:44.669
Good girl.

11:51.193 --> 11:52.470
Come on, Motto.

11:52.573 --> 11:55.922
Toasted coconut, Chef?

11:56.025 --> 11:57.993
Peanut butter.

11:58.096 --> 12:01.790
Could Mia be the first
this year to go 4 for 4

12:01.893 --> 12:11.972
[music playing]

12:12.076 --> 12:13.836
NARRATOR: round two
of Chef Ramsay's

12:13.940 --> 12:17.737
18th annual blind taste
test, and rookie Mia

12:17.840 --> 12:21.775
is one correct answeraway from a perfect score.

12:21.879 --> 12:26.090
Let's see if Mia
can stay perfect.

12:26.193 --> 12:27.332
Come on, Mia.

12:27.436 --> 12:28.230
Peanut butter.

12:28.333 --> 12:29.990
Yes.

12:30.094 --> 12:31.612
Nice work, Mia.

12:31.716 --> 12:32.648
Mia.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.029
Four for four.

12:34.132 --> 12:35.237
Challenge master.

12:35.340 --> 12:36.376
Good job.
OK.

12:36.479 --> 12:37.791
Mia and Motto, take the seats.

12:37.895 --> 12:39.275
Next up, Bret and Ariel.

12:39.379 --> 12:40.863
Let's go.
- Come on, Ariel.

12:40.967 --> 12:41.830
CHEF RAMSAY: OK

12:41.933 --> 12:43.210
I'm nervous.

12:43.314 --> 12:46.213
I'm more nervous about thisthan I am cooking challenges.

12:46.317 --> 12:47.801
I don't want to look
like a total doofus

12:47.905 --> 12:49.803
and get 0 out of 4.

12:49.907 --> 12:50.700
Right.

12:50.804 --> 12:52.392
Let's go for something simple.

12:52.495 --> 12:57.190
Pistachio, the most
famous nut in the world.

12:57.293 --> 12:58.260
Chocolate chip, Chef?

12:58.363 --> 12:59.502
Chocolate chip.

12:59.606 --> 13:00.918
Wrong.

13:01.021 --> 13:02.574
Caramel, chef?

13:02.678 --> 13:03.817
No.

13:03.921 --> 13:08.615
Number two, a staple acrossItalian cuisine, garlic.

13:08.718 --> 13:09.512
You got to get this one.

13:09.616 --> 13:10.617
I would hope so.

13:10.720 --> 13:11.825
He uses it in
fucking everything.

13:11.929 --> 13:13.793
He has it tattooed on him.

13:13.896 --> 13:14.863
Garlic, Chef.

13:14.966 --> 13:15.933
Nice.

13:16.036 --> 13:16.796
Garlic, Chef.

13:22.353 --> 13:23.699
Come on, Bret.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.115
Coconut?

13:26.219 --> 13:27.013
Coconut, Chef.

13:32.087 --> 13:34.917
Jalapeno, she should get it.

13:35.021 --> 13:37.230
Heather would love this one.

13:37.333 --> 13:40.405
Sriracha, Chef?

13:40.509 --> 13:41.372
Pasta to the face.

13:41.475 --> 13:43.098
Motto, time to
face your pasta.

13:48.862 --> 13:50.519
HEATHER: It's like up the nose.

13:50.622 --> 13:53.384
Man, that thing's got
some force coming now.

13:53.487 --> 13:55.213
CHEF RAMSAY: This is good

13:55.317 --> 13:56.111
Jalapeno?

13:59.321 --> 14:03.808
Thank you, Ariel
and thank your mouth.

14:03.912 --> 14:05.465
- Well done.
- Thank you.

14:05.568 --> 14:06.811
I don't like this challenge.

14:06.915 --> 14:08.951
Why does everybody else getthis fucking magic tongue?

14:09.055 --> 14:10.953
What if everybody else getstwo and three out of four,

14:11.057 --> 14:13.231
and I'm the only asshole
t hat goes 0 for 4?

14:13.335 --> 14:16.131
The scores coming to thisfinal rounds, 9 for the blue,

14:16.234 --> 14:17.270
5 for the red.

14:17.373 --> 14:21.239
That means red, you need
a clean sweep to tie.

14:21.343 --> 14:25.761
Ladies, you need to just getone correct, and you've won.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.384
Kanae, Jose, let's go.

14:28.488 --> 14:29.351
Don't be nervous.

14:29.454 --> 14:31.732
Ariel, Bret, in the chair.

14:31.836 --> 14:33.631
So let's go for coffee.

14:33.734 --> 14:34.874
She doesn't drink coffee.

14:34.977 --> 14:35.771
Fuck.

14:42.088 --> 14:43.537
Coffee, Chef?

14:43.641 --> 14:44.953
Correct.

14:45.056 --> 14:49.129
If Kanae gets this correct,she wins it for the blue team.

14:49.233 --> 14:51.062
Oh, come on, Kanae.

14:59.588 --> 15:00.658
Coffee, Chef.

15:01.659 --> 15:02.971
Yes.

15:03.074 --> 15:04.904
That's the ball game.

15:06.422 --> 15:08.114
We won again.

15:08.217 --> 15:09.943
We didn't just win by a point.

15:10.047 --> 15:11.324
We annihilated them.

15:11.427 --> 15:12.428
Blue team.

15:12.532 --> 15:14.292
Congratulations.

15:14.396 --> 15:17.640
You're in for anincredible day of pampering

15:17.744 --> 15:20.298
and relaxation at
Southern California's

15:20.402 --> 15:23.060
premier Korean spa.

15:23.163 --> 15:24.268
Oh my god.

15:24.371 --> 15:28.030
Whatever service you
want, they have it.

15:28.134 --> 15:30.584
I need a scrub, Chef.

15:30.688 --> 15:33.035
Yes, a spa day.

15:33.139 --> 15:35.831
Now, gentlemen,
whilst the blue team

15:35.935 --> 15:39.800
are relaxing their backs,you'll be straining your back.

15:39.904 --> 15:43.563
You need to clean up the
mess in the dining room,

15:43.666 --> 15:47.567
and tonight we'll be honoringtwo very special charities.

15:47.670 --> 15:50.156
I want two 12 tops set up.

15:50.259 --> 15:51.881
Polish all the silverware.

15:51.985 --> 15:54.056
And we'll be serving
a special gelato

15:54.160 --> 15:56.576
for dessert, which
you'll be making

15:56.679 --> 16:01.132
from scratch, cranking it by--

16:01.236 --> 16:02.099
ALL: Hand.

16:02.202 --> 16:03.790
--to perfection.

16:03.893 --> 16:05.033
Is that clear?
- Yes,

16:05.136 --> 16:06.103
Chef.
Off you go.

16:09.209 --> 16:10.900
I just made an
ass out of myself.

16:11.004 --> 16:12.074
Trevor, pick your head up.

16:12.178 --> 16:14.456
There's nothing you
could do about it now.

16:14.559 --> 16:15.595
This is the big one.

16:15.698 --> 16:17.321
If you don't score
in this challenge,

16:17.424 --> 16:18.356
you're not going to get the job.

16:21.428 --> 16:22.774
You all right, bub?

16:22.878 --> 16:24.086
No.

16:24.190 --> 16:24.984
Deep breath.

16:25.087 --> 16:26.295
- That's it.
- No.

16:26.399 --> 16:27.676
No, no, no.
It's not.

16:27.779 --> 16:28.573
It's all palette.

16:28.677 --> 16:29.505
You know it is.

16:29.609 --> 16:30.748
Don't let this break you.

16:30.851 --> 16:33.095
You're fucking better than that.

16:33.199 --> 16:34.476
You've got to have
a palette, and I

16:34.579 --> 16:36.961
just shat the fucking bed.

16:37.065 --> 16:38.376
Just take a deep breath, man.

16:38.480 --> 16:42.932
I'm embarrassed
This is my life.

16:43.036 --> 16:44.313
I chose to do this for a living.

16:44.417 --> 16:45.866
What does it say
about you as a chef.

16:45.970 --> 16:48.869
If you can't identify foursimple fucking ingredients?

16:48.973 --> 16:51.148
This isn't going
to define me, but

16:51.251 --> 16:52.942
damned if I'm not disappointed.

16:58.983 --> 17:00.536
I have your cleaning
supplies here for you,

17:00.640 --> 17:02.021
so let's get started.

17:02.124 --> 17:02.918
OK.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.644
Grazie.

17:04.747 --> 17:06.715
Trevor scoring 0 did us in.

17:06.818 --> 17:09.062
I mean, it does not feel
good to fucking lose.

17:09.166 --> 17:10.408
We on our hands and
knees scrubbing.

17:10.512 --> 17:13.860
I feel like Cinderella and shit.

17:13.963 --> 17:15.620
It looks like a
mafia movie when they

17:15.724 --> 17:17.795
kill people in the restaurant.

17:17.898 --> 17:18.796
Fucking rude.

17:26.252 --> 17:27.977
It feels so good
to keep on winning.

17:28.081 --> 17:29.531
It's so much validation.

17:29.634 --> 17:32.879
Yeah, we're the shit.

17:32.982 --> 17:34.743
This feels so good.

17:34.846 --> 17:36.676
I feel like royalty.

17:36.779 --> 17:39.230
These challenges are
so awesome to win.

17:42.854 --> 17:44.235
I have a feeling Trevor.

17:44.339 --> 17:45.340
KANAE: Trevor is going to snap.

17:51.587 --> 17:55.867
Jose really needed this toscrub off all that pasta sauce.

18:01.735 --> 18:04.359
NARRATOR: While the blue teamgets pampered at the spa,

18:04.462 --> 18:05.567
the red team turns gelato.

18:09.709 --> 18:11.297
You broke it already, Trevor?

18:11.400 --> 18:13.609
Yeah, sure, whatever.

18:13.713 --> 18:16.647
Trev has somehow sabotagedthe ice cream churner.

18:16.750 --> 18:17.786
How are we going to fix it?

18:17.889 --> 18:19.719
The threads won't
pop into the seat.

18:19.822 --> 18:21.859
You're the reason
we're here, and I'm

18:21.962 --> 18:24.344
not going to be the onlyone cranking this stuff out.

18:24.448 --> 18:26.760
As Jose and Bret
polish silverware,

18:26.864 --> 18:30.661
Trevor is still on his
first batch of churning.

18:30.764 --> 18:32.697
Come on, guys, I justwant to do the punishment.

18:32.801 --> 18:34.837
I'm being weird about this.

18:34.941 --> 18:37.426
Don't break this one, Trev.

18:37.530 --> 18:39.152
Don't break this one.

18:39.256 --> 18:41.258
Everybody just
thinks that, you know,

18:41.361 --> 18:45.158
I'm a shit-head for getting 0for 4 on the blind taste test.

18:45.262 --> 18:49.645
Hey, Trevor, what flavoris it, banana or carrot?

18:49.749 --> 18:52.096
It would be nice if somebodyactually gave a shit, you know,

18:52.200 --> 18:53.097
what I was going through, too.

18:56.997 --> 18:58.827
You need five minutes,
like, you need to put

18:58.930 --> 18:59.931
some cold water on your face?

19:00.035 --> 19:00.829
Figure it out?

19:00.932 --> 19:02.900
You'll be all right?

19:03.003 --> 19:03.866
I'm fucking sick of it.

19:03.970 --> 19:05.109
I really am.

19:05.213 --> 19:07.939
Trevor has fucked it all up.

19:08.043 --> 19:09.389
Sometimes the clown
gets sick of laughing.

19:16.879 --> 19:20.055
NARRATOR: After Trevor went 0for 4 in the blind taste test--

19:20.159 --> 19:22.678
Hey, Trevor, what flavoris it, banana or carrot?

19:22.782 --> 19:25.267
Oh.

19:25.371 --> 19:27.166
NARRATOR: His teammates
aren't exactly

19:27.269 --> 19:28.753
helping him get over it.

19:28.857 --> 19:31.584
Trevor just fucked it all up.

19:31.687 --> 19:33.310
Sometimes the clown
gets sick of laughing.

19:38.625 --> 19:41.490
Today has probably been themost stressful day for me

19:41.594 --> 19:43.285
on Hell's Kitchen so far.

19:43.389 --> 19:45.529
He better fucking
snap out of it.

19:45.632 --> 19:46.944
He's good for elimination.

19:47.047 --> 19:49.015
I just wanted to crawl
underneath the covers

19:49.118 --> 19:51.190
and pretend the world isn'tthere for a little bit,

19:51.293 --> 19:54.365
but you don't get
that luxury in HK.

19:54.469 --> 19:55.746
You got to bounce back.

19:55.849 --> 19:57.161
You've got to show Chef
that you can do it,

19:57.265 --> 19:58.473
and that's what I'm
going to do tonight.

20:01.338 --> 20:02.511
What else can I
do to make your life

20:02.615 --> 20:03.719
more interesting, Bret?

20:03.823 --> 20:04.824
Interesting?

20:04.927 --> 20:06.032
I don't think that's
the word I'm using.

We just need to work together.

20:23.118 --> 20:24.947
It's really not-- it
shouldn't be that hard.

20:25.051 --> 20:25.845
Nice.

20:25.948 --> 20:27.571

disease at absolutely

20:52.527 --> 20:56.116

means a lot to me.

20:58.084 --> 21:00.983
They helped save my niece,so that's huge for me.

21:01.087 --> 21:02.813

Bang it out.

Make it pretty.

27:59.988 --> 28:01.058
I want tight sauces, though.

pressure right now.

28:09.446 --> 28:11.551
I have to keep
the momentum going

28:11.655 --> 28:14.140
and put some trust
in my teammates,

28:14.244 --> 28:15.555

You know what I mean?

28:34.678 --> 28:36.197
I want sex on a plate.

28:36.300 --> 28:38.406
I want somebody to look
at it and go, "Ooh.

28:38.509 --> 28:39.372
I just want-- ooh.

28:39.476 --> 28:40.408

What do you want on them?What do you need?

29:04.432 --> 29:05.364
I need them the same--

29:05.467 --> 29:06.572
looking the exact same.

29:06.675 --> 29:08.885
ARIEL: You need morepasta in this one, ladies.

29:08.988 --> 29:10.024

These are too small.
- Heather.

29:11.266 --> 29:12.095
What?

29:12.198 --> 29:12.992
I need it better looking.

29:13.096 --> 29:13.890
It's sloppy.

29:13.993 --> 29:14.856
I'm going to clean them.

29:14.960 --> 29:16.375
I'm trying to portion size it.

29:16.478 --> 29:17.721
Yeah, but it's not
the right portion.

29:17.825 --> 29:18.929
HEATHER: Move.
Smaller or bigger?

29:19.033 --> 29:20.172
You tell me and
I'll pull it out.

29:20.275 --> 29:21.414
It just needs to
be plated better.

29:21.518 --> 29:22.312
OK.

29:22.415 --> 29:23.658
So tell me that, then.

Take it easy, woman.

32:52.246 --> 32:53.695
Who cooked it?

32:53.799 --> 32:56.802
I was cooking veal,
along with Trev.

32:56.905 --> 32:58.148
- Jose, did you check?
- Yes, Chef.

32:58.252 --> 32:59.805
Most of them.I didn't open them up, though.

32:59.908 --> 33:02.497
Oh, fucking no.

33:02.601 --> 33:03.464
Oh no.

33:03.567 --> 33:04.430
Oh my god.

33:05.569 --> 33:06.363
No.

33:10.609 --> 33:12.369
Guys, come here, in the back.

33:12.473 --> 33:13.474
Look at this.

33:13.577 --> 33:14.578
Jose dropped the ball.

33:14.682 --> 33:15.994
Not one of them was cut into.

33:16.097 --> 33:17.996
It looks like something
out of a horror movie

33:18.099 --> 33:20.895
that you peeled off aradioactive monster's back.

33:20.999 --> 33:21.792
Oh.

33:21.896 --> 33:23.242
It looks like a giant scab.

33:23.346 --> 33:24.174
CHEF RAMSAY: Just touch that.

33:26.970 --> 33:28.075
Marino.
Oh.

33:28.178 --> 33:29.007
There's more coming back.

33:29.110 --> 33:30.215
Oh, fuck.

33:32.596 --> 33:34.771
No.

33:34.874 --> 33:36.048
I need six.

33:36.152 --> 33:38.706
Oh, shit.

33:38.809 --> 33:39.776
Oh my gosh.

33:47.991 --> 33:49.993
NARRATOR: Hell's Kitchen ishosting a special charity

33:50.097 --> 33:53.341
dinner honoring supportersof the Waterkeeper Alliance

33:53.445 --> 33:56.275
and St. Jude Children's
Research Hospital.

33:56.379 --> 33:59.140
With both teams serving thefourth course of the night,

33:59.244 --> 34:03.731
the blue team's table isenjoying their meal, while half

34:03.834 --> 34:05.319
of the red team's 12 top--

34:05.422 --> 34:06.389
Oh, there's more coming back.

34:06.492 --> 34:08.218
Oh, fuck no.

34:08.322 --> 34:13.189
NARRATOR: --have sent backtheir raw veal saltimbocca.

34:13.292 --> 34:16.882
I think people are getting itin the head with broken plates.

34:16.985 --> 34:17.986
This is crazy.

34:18.090 --> 34:19.402
I wish I could have
cooked the veal myself.

34:19.505 --> 34:21.266
I feel like my team
let me down, for sure.

34:21.369 --> 34:22.301
You, get over the souffle.

34:22.405 --> 34:23.199
Yes, Chef.

34:23.302 --> 34:24.441
You, get on with the souffle.

34:24.545 --> 34:26.443
Chef.

34:26.547 --> 34:29.274
Oh my god.

34:29.377 --> 34:31.655
It was up to you to do
what was needed, Jose.

34:31.759 --> 34:33.864
Not me, not Motto, not Bret.

34:33.968 --> 34:35.349
And you didn't check one thing.

34:35.452 --> 34:37.144
You just fucking
screwed us, bro.

34:39.801 --> 34:41.286
I can't believe it.

34:41.389 --> 34:42.770
Oh, boy.

34:42.873 --> 34:44.082
I cannot believe it.

34:44.185 --> 34:46.014
MOTTO: If Chef Ramsay's
cooking for us,

34:46.118 --> 34:47.809
that means we
fucked up real bad.

34:47.913 --> 34:49.259
Send the four,
please, Christina.

34:49.363 --> 34:50.398
Yes, Chef.

34:50.502 --> 34:53.021
We're lucky Chef didn't
stab us or something.

34:53.125 --> 34:56.370
NARRATOR: The red team is nowrunning a full course behind--

34:56.473 --> 34:57.647
I'm ready for dessert.

34:57.750 --> 34:59.131
NARRATOR: --as the
blue team charges

34:59.235 --> 35:01.478
ahead with theirtiramisu souffle dessert.

35:02.479 --> 35:03.618
Let's go.

35:03.722 --> 35:04.792
DINER: Hello.

35:04.895 --> 35:06.345
DINER: You're doing a great job.This is awesome.

35:06.449 --> 35:07.312
HEATHER: Thank you.

35:07.415 --> 35:08.209
Yeah, this has
been great, you guys.

35:08.313 --> 35:09.245
Thank you.

35:09.348 --> 35:11.833
This dessert
matches my bottom,

35:11.937 --> 35:13.559
and it will go
straight to my bottom.

35:13.663 --> 35:15.423
High five.

35:15.527 --> 35:16.562
CHEF RAMSAY: Go.
Just take it.

35:16.666 --> 35:17.460
You got to go.

35:17.563 --> 35:18.737
[inaudible] one

35:18.840 --> 35:20.566
NARRATOR: Meanwhile, thered team races to catch up.

35:20.670 --> 35:21.498
CHEF RAMSAY: Go.

35:21.602 --> 35:23.397
Go, go, go, go, go.

35:23.500 --> 35:24.708
DINER: Thank you so much

35:24.812 --> 35:26.124
BRET: Bon appetit.
My pleasure.

35:26.227 --> 35:27.746
Thank you.
- Oh my gosh.

35:27.849 --> 35:28.712
This is so good.

35:32.337 --> 35:34.925
When we close Hell'sKitchen for a night like this,

35:35.029 --> 35:38.412
it means so much to
me and our reputation.

35:38.515 --> 35:41.794
I'm very disappointed.

35:41.898 --> 35:47.110
The losing team tonight
is the red team.

35:47.214 --> 35:51.321
Men, want to go back to the dormand nominate two individuals.

35:51.425 --> 35:52.253
Piss off.

35:52.357 --> 35:53.496
ALL: Yes, Chef.

35:53.599 --> 35:54.428
Pathetic.

35:54.531 --> 35:57.293
CHEF: St. Jude, man.

35:57.396 --> 35:58.915
Everybody fucked up tonight.

35:59.018 --> 36:01.814
Average stations, exceptfor carbonara and souffle,

36:01.918 --> 36:02.953
which I ran.

36:03.057 --> 36:04.679
So God help those
guys if they try

36:04.783 --> 36:06.440
and fucking put me up tonight.

36:06.543 --> 36:07.855
Not a chance.

36:07.958 --> 36:10.168
BRET: I definitely don't thinkI should be up for elimination.

36:10.271 --> 36:11.134
That's for sure.

36:11.238 --> 36:12.549
I know I owned
two stations tonight

36:12.653 --> 36:14.896
that went out flawlessly.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.415
What's the second station?

36:16.519 --> 36:17.313
The desserts was mine.

36:17.416 --> 36:18.728
That was a team effort.

36:18.831 --> 36:20.143
That was a team
effort, but I was the--

36:20.247 --> 36:22.110
JOSE: You had carbonara, whichwas the easiest station to do.

36:22.214 --> 36:23.905
Hey, can I finished
the sentence?

36:24.009 --> 36:26.908
The only thing you
managed was a carbonara

36:27.012 --> 36:27.875
that we do every day.

36:27.978 --> 36:29.152
That went out flawlessly.

36:29.256 --> 36:31.119
Yeah, you know why
it went out well?

36:31.223 --> 36:32.638
Because you didn'tfucking cooking anything.

36:32.742 --> 36:33.570
Exactly, exactly.

36:33.674 --> 36:34.985
[interposing voices]

36:35.089 --> 36:37.402
What about the
scallops from the start?

36:37.505 --> 36:39.473
That was not my
fucking scallops.

36:39.576 --> 36:41.060
The fucking bad
ones that came back

36:41.164 --> 36:42.821
that were fucking not
cooked on the other side

36:42.924 --> 36:44.547
were the ones that youburned to a crisp, brother.

36:44.650 --> 36:46.928
Burnt to a crisp?

36:47.032 --> 36:48.067
That was all Bret and I.

36:48.171 --> 36:49.310
I watched everything
I did tonight, man.

36:49.414 --> 36:50.932
- Burnt to a crisp?
- I'm not fucking--

36:51.036 --> 36:52.002
No.I'm not putting up with it.

36:52.106 --> 36:53.590
It'll be like listen, no way.

36:53.694 --> 36:55.558
Chef's going to laugh youguys right out of the fucking

36:55.661 --> 36:57.387
kitchen and put your
ass up for elimination

36:57.491 --> 36:58.354
if you try and put me there.

36:58.457 --> 37:00.183
Now, I'm not going anywhere.

37:00.287 --> 37:01.805
I didn't fuck up half
of my fucking veal.

37:01.909 --> 37:04.083
I pulled my pans off whenthey were too fucking hot.

37:04.187 --> 37:04.981
Mine were sitting there.

37:05.084 --> 37:06.258
So it's either you or it's me.

37:06.362 --> 37:07.259
Go ahead.

37:07.363 --> 37:08.536
Which veals were they?
Whose were they?

37:08.640 --> 37:09.813
Were they Motto's
or where they mine?

37:09.917 --> 37:11.401
- How do we know?- How do you fucking know?

37:11.505 --> 37:12.609
Did it have your name?

37:12.713 --> 37:13.403
You checked all the onesthat I had on my pans.

37:13.507 --> 37:14.404
You checked them personally.

37:14.508 --> 37:15.578
You're not intimidating
by getting loud.

37:15.681 --> 37:16.751
All right?

37:16.855 --> 37:18.028
You act like a little
bitch in the kitchen.

37:18.132 --> 37:19.340
Now you want to be
all fucking loud.

37:19.444 --> 37:21.066
Personally, I don't thinkTrevor deserves to be here.

37:21.169 --> 37:22.274
I don't.

37:22.378 --> 37:23.206
I think he should've beengone a long time ago.

37:23.310 --> 37:25.657
Everything he does
fucking sucks.

37:25.760 --> 37:26.589
Besides talk.

37:26.692 --> 37:27.969
That veal was murder.

37:28.073 --> 37:29.419
If you would've
just cut into one.

37:29.523 --> 37:30.800
If you would've
just cut into one.

37:30.903 --> 37:31.732
I didn't think about it.

37:31.835 --> 37:32.871
That was disastrous.

37:32.974 --> 37:34.252
I had you check all of mine.

37:34.355 --> 37:35.908
Again, not owning
up to anything.

37:36.012 --> 37:37.669
You know, he never
owns up to anything.

37:37.772 --> 37:38.635
Yeah.

37:38.739 --> 37:39.567
OK.

37:39.671 --> 37:41.569
Did you fuck up
scallops today?

37:41.673 --> 37:43.157
No.
Come on.

37:43.261 --> 37:44.538
Of course not.
Of course not.

37:44.641 --> 37:45.470
See what I mean?

37:45.573 --> 37:46.540
You don't fucking
own up to shit.

37:46.643 --> 37:47.748
All you do is run
around with your fucking

37:47.851 --> 37:49.163
nose up Chef's ass.

37:49.267 --> 37:50.440
That's what you do
all fucking day.

37:50.544 --> 37:51.993
Well, you're the fuckingtail running around.

37:52.097 --> 37:53.132
Hey, Chef, how about this?

37:53.236 --> 37:54.444
How about we cut the
fucking lamb like this?

37:54.548 --> 37:55.480
I think this would be great.

37:55.583 --> 37:57.171
- No one can work with you.- All right.

37:57.275 --> 37:58.068
Yeah.

37:58.172 --> 38:14.671
[music playing]

38:14.775 --> 38:17.985
Well, red team, youroyally fucked that one up.

38:21.195 --> 38:22.955
Men, have you come
to a consensus?

38:23.059 --> 38:24.578
Yes, Chef.

38:24.681 --> 38:27.891
Trevor, red team'sfirst nomination and why.

38:27.995 --> 38:29.859
First nomination was Jose.

38:29.962 --> 38:30.963
He was in charge of the veal.

38:31.067 --> 38:33.863
It was his station to run.

38:33.966 --> 38:35.554
Trevor, second
nominee and why.

38:40.766 --> 38:42.320
- Me, chef.
- You?

38:42.423 --> 38:43.390
Do know why?

38:43.493 --> 38:45.184
There's a couple of
reasons, apparently.

38:45.288 --> 38:47.497
They put the veal on
me, even though it

38:47.601 --> 38:49.672
was two of us working thatstation and somebody else

38:49.775 --> 38:50.880
was in charge of it.

38:50.983 --> 38:53.952
I, apparently, kiss yourass all the time as well.

38:54.055 --> 38:54.849
You what?

38:54.953 --> 38:56.230
I'm too loud.

38:56.334 --> 38:58.439
And there's no communicationwith me, apparently.

38:58.543 --> 38:59.060
OK.
Hold on.

38:59.164 --> 39:00.234
Hold on a minute.

39:00.338 --> 39:01.304
Yeah.

39:01.408 --> 39:02.788
Bret, just clarify.

39:02.892 --> 39:07.103
We feel that our team wouldbe stronger without him.

39:07.206 --> 39:09.070
Trevor, Jose, step forward.

39:14.075 --> 39:17.285
Jose, why are you
different from Trevor?

39:17.389 --> 39:18.873
One of the main reasons
Trevor's up here today

39:18.977 --> 39:21.220
is because he fucked
up scallops and he

39:21.324 --> 39:23.637
fucked up the veal as well.

39:23.740 --> 39:25.432
There was two people
on each station.

39:25.535 --> 39:26.329
I cooked my scallops.

39:26.433 --> 39:27.261
They went up.

39:27.365 --> 39:28.676
I followed orders
tonight on veal,

39:28.780 --> 39:29.850
and there's six came back.

39:29.953 --> 39:31.576
So there's two people
on fucking veal.

39:31.679 --> 39:32.784
Two people--
- Who cooked the veal?

39:32.887 --> 39:34.441
Two people cooking.We both had fucking veal in

39:34.544 --> 39:35.580
[interposing voices]- What did you say earlier?

39:35.683 --> 39:36.857
That Motto cooked them.
Right?

39:36.960 --> 39:37.961
No.
I said we both--

39:38.065 --> 39:38.514
Because you couldn't
take the blame.

39:38.617 --> 39:39.480
No, not at all.

39:39.584 --> 39:40.516
The same way you're
not taking blame

39:40.619 --> 39:41.586
for the scallops you fucked up.

39:41.689 --> 39:42.518
That's my point there.

39:42.621 --> 39:43.450
You don't own it

39:43.553 --> 39:44.623
Why would I own a mistake.

39:44.727 --> 39:45.486
I didn't make?

39:48.109 --> 39:49.904
CHEF RAMSAY: Jose, why shouldyou stay in Hell's Kitchen?

39:50.008 --> 39:51.596
I have a lot of
drive, a lot of passion.

39:51.699 --> 39:54.461
Today was a bad day when
it came to that dish,

39:54.564 --> 39:58.844
but overall, I've been strongand I've continued to grow.

39:58.948 --> 40:00.984
I've got more fight
in me than anybody here.

40:01.088 --> 40:02.745
I want this more
than anybody here.

40:02.848 --> 40:04.263
I prove it to you
on a daily basis.

40:04.367 --> 40:06.093
I bounce back, no matter what.

40:06.196 --> 40:07.957
And I bounced back
hard again today.

40:08.060 --> 40:08.854
You're looking for a leader.

40:08.958 --> 40:09.752
You saw one today.

40:13.203 --> 40:21.522
My decision is Trev.

40:25.043 --> 40:25.837
Back in line.

40:28.702 --> 40:29.461
Jose, come here.

40:33.051 --> 40:35.191
Tonight was a disaster.

40:35.294 --> 40:38.988
Your lack of leadership onyour course that you own

40:39.091 --> 40:40.541
confirms that you
are not ready to be

40:40.645 --> 40:42.163
my head chef in Las Vegas.

40:42.267 --> 40:44.476
It's for that reason
I want your jacket.

40:44.580 --> 40:45.408
Thank you, Chef.

40:45.512 --> 40:46.305
Thank you.

40:46.409 --> 40:47.790
Appreciate you.

40:47.893 --> 40:48.860
I wish you the best of luck.

40:48.963 --> 40:50.171
- It was an honor, Chef.
- Thank you.

40:50.275 --> 40:51.069
Head up.

40:55.245 --> 40:58.179
It's a disappointment andit has been a long journey,

40:58.283 --> 41:00.423
but it was ultimately
a learning experience.

41:00.527 --> 41:02.494
The lesson is don't
hold yourself back.

41:02.598 --> 41:05.393
Go, go for the stars.

41:05.497 --> 41:07.948
That's all I can say.

41:08.051 --> 41:09.294
Now listen carefully.

41:09.397 --> 41:12.124
I expect all of you to comeout of the comfort zone

41:12.228 --> 41:16.197
and prevent mistakes
from happening.

41:16.301 --> 41:17.302
Piss off.

41:17.405 --> 41:20.063
Chef.

41:20.167 --> 41:21.271
I know how to cook.

41:21.375 --> 41:23.032
I know what Chef
wants, and I'm trying

41:23.135 --> 41:24.309
to fucking give it to him.

41:24.412 --> 41:25.586
This is a job interview.

41:25.690 --> 41:27.830
So the rest of theseMoppets, I could give two

41:27.933 --> 41:29.072
shits what they think about me.

41:29.176 --> 41:30.902
I really do.

41:31.005 --> 41:32.973
I absolutely think Trevorshould've gone home tonight.

41:33.076 --> 41:34.975
I just feel like he's
a cancer to the team.

41:35.078 --> 41:38.944
Moving forward, he needs to stepit up and carry his own weight.

41:39.048 --> 41:40.394
ARIEL: I think the
red team are so

41:40.498 --> 41:43.362
consumed by their own
hate for each other

41:43.466 --> 41:45.468
that they're just
not getting it.

41:45.572 --> 41:48.091
It's really a bad sign for them.

NARRATOR: On a night when itshould have been Hell's Kitchen

41:50.300 --> 41:52.406

it was charities that ended upgiving back Jose's raw veal.

42:01.519 --> 42:03.486

They don't like me.

42:18.812 --> 42:20.814
There's nothing about thisdish that came together.

42:20.917 --> 42:23.161

What is happening?

42:35.276 --> 42:39.004
NARRATOR: --put these twochefs back together again?

42:39.108 --> 42:42.905
