00:28.532 --> 00:34.663
Once, man and those in the water
were linked.

00:34.872 --> 00:37.124
They inspired us.

00:37.332 --> 00:39.543
They spoke of the future.

00:39.751 --> 00:44.464
Man listened and it became real.

00:45.090 --> 00:48.969
But man does not listen very well.

00:49.178 --> 00:54.975
Man 's need to own everything
led him deeper into land.

00:55.184 --> 00:58.604
The magic world of the ones
that live in the ocean...

00:58.812 --> 01:01.148
...and the world of men...

01:01.356 --> 01:03.567
...separated.

01:03.775 --> 01:08.071
Through the centuries, their world,
and all the inhabitants of it...

01:08.238 --> 01:10.157
...stopped trying.

01:11.366 --> 01:14.453
The world of man became more violent.

01:14.661 --> 01:20.500
War upon war played out,
as there were no guides to listen to.

01:21.668 --> 01:25.881
Now those in the water
are trying again...

01:26.048 --> 01:28.634
...trying to reach us.

01:28.842 --> 01:33.764
A handful of their precious young ones
have been sent into the world of man.

01:33.972 --> 01:36.642
They are brought in the dead of night...

01:36.850 --> 01:40.187
...to where man lives.

01:40.354 --> 01:43.190
They need only be glimpsed...

01:43.398 --> 01:47.152
...and the awakening of man
will happen.

01:47.361 --> 01:50.697
But their enemies roam the land.

01:50.906 --> 01:54.368
There are laws that are meant
to keep the young ones safe...

01:54.576 --> 01:58.455
...but they are sent
at great risk to their lives.

01:58.664 --> 02:00.457
Many...

02:00.624 --> 02:02.626
...do not return.

02:05.754 --> 02:08.340
Yet still they try...

02:08.549 --> 02:11.552
...try to help man.

02:12.553 --> 02:18.475
But man may have
forgotten how to listen.

02:35.033 --> 02:38.287
My daughter says to be careful,
Mr. Heep.

02:42.791 --> 02:47.087
Well, it's some kind
of a b... B... B... Bug.

02:47.296 --> 02:49.256
It's very big.

02:50.090 --> 02:52.050
It's very hairy.

02:56.221 --> 03:01.101
My other daughter says it's
some kind of creature the devil made.

03:01.310 --> 03:02.603
Tell her it's not a creature.

03:02.811 --> 03:05.981
There's no such thing as creatures,
all right?

03:06.523 --> 03:07.774
You...

03:07.983 --> 03:10.527
You might wanna turn away.

03:23.832 --> 03:26.835
Sorry this is taking so long.

03:40.182 --> 03:42.643
It's over. It's over.

03:42.976 --> 03:45.687
It's... It's safe.

03:51.693 --> 03:56.823
My daughter says
thank you for protecting them.

04:02.079 --> 04:03.622
Mr. Farber?

04:03.789 --> 04:06.708
I'm Cleveland Heep.
Welcome to the Cove.

04:07.125 --> 04:09.086
Mr. Heep!

04:15.175 --> 04:16.426
You are new tenant?

04:16.593 --> 04:20.096
Yeah, this is Mr. Farber. He's in 13B.

04:20.305 --> 04:23.725
Now, Mr. Farber, this is Young-Soon
Choi. She lives with her mother in 8A.

04:23.934 --> 04:27.271
She's a student at the university.

04:27.896 --> 04:30.190
Young-Soon, you don't know...

04:30.357 --> 04:34.111
...who's been swimming in the pool
the last few nights, do you?

04:34.278 --> 04:36.572
No, Mr. Heep.

04:37.239 --> 04:39.950
By the way, here. Thanks. I liked it.

04:40.117 --> 04:41.743
You're welcome.

04:41.910 --> 04:46.164
Mr. Heep loves learning.
He doesn't want people to know.

04:46.748 --> 04:51.378
Mr. Heep, pool man looking for you.
I tell him you come soon.

04:53.547 --> 04:55.924
Could you wait here just a moment,
please?

04:56.383 --> 04:59.595
Gonna ask something. Answer straight.
You guys having parties in here?

04:59.761 --> 05:02.139
Bubble parties, bubble bath,
everyone skinny-dipping?

05:02.306 --> 05:03.557
No.

05:03.724 --> 05:06.935
- Those bubbles make the water very slick.
- No.

05:08.270 --> 05:12.566
I'll trust you on that. But something
is making this water like this.

05:12.733 --> 05:16.403
There has been someone
swimming at nighttime.

05:16.612 --> 05:21.408
I hear sp... Sp... Sp...
Splashing some nights.

05:22.367 --> 05:25.621
I left here yesterday afternoon,
this filter was empty.

05:34.463 --> 05:38.217
You kind of look like maybe
you could work out a little bit, right?

05:39.134 --> 05:40.969
I could give you a vein like that.

05:41.136 --> 05:44.806
I could make it look just like this. Right?

05:45.641 --> 05:47.768
Most people say,
"What's wrong with you, Reggie?

05:47.976 --> 05:50.812
Why you only working out
on one side of your body?"

05:50.979 --> 05:55.651
I tell them it's like an experiment.
I'm like a scientist.

06:00.239 --> 06:04.034
This morning I measured my bicep.

06:05.327 --> 06:08.455
Four-and-a-half-inch difference
from one side to the other.

06:08.622 --> 06:10.207
Look at that.

06:10.374 --> 06:12.668
Take a guess at the difference
between my thighs.

06:13.168 --> 06:14.545
- Hello, Reggie.
- Hey.

06:14.711 --> 06:17.172
- Hey. Sorry.
- Hey.

06:17.464 --> 06:20.133
Me and the new guy,
we're talking science.

06:20.300 --> 06:22.928
Okay, that's great. Here we go, Mr. F...

06:23.095 --> 06:25.430
Here we go. Come on.

06:27.307 --> 06:31.019
Don't hang out in the stairwell,
Reggie, please.

06:31.186 --> 06:33.480
- Okay.
- All right.

06:33.647 --> 06:38.026
Just... People might trip.

06:38.193 --> 06:39.236
All right.

06:39.403 --> 06:42.364
Reggie's harmless.
He just wants to be special.

06:42.531 --> 06:44.783
He's working out
only one side of his body.

06:44.950 --> 06:47.703
Did he...? Did he tell you that?

06:47.870 --> 06:49.746
- Be inside within minutes.

06:49.913 --> 06:51.164
Hello, Mr. Leeds.

06:51.331 --> 06:55.043
Those soldiers are only now beginning to
wonder how long they'll end up staying.

06:55.210 --> 06:59.173
If this does come to combat, we will not
be in the battle for the sake of the battle.

06:59.339 --> 07:00.924
He's been here f... F... Forever.

07:01.091 --> 07:03.510
- Will not be reached any other way.

07:04.887 --> 07:09.641
Mrs. Bell, she takes in animals.
Smart lady. You'd like her.

07:12.728 --> 07:15.856
- He... Not just because he died.
- There's a bunch of people better.

07:16.023 --> 07:18.525
- Name four people better.
- Name one better than Fred.

07:18.692 --> 07:23.113
Axl Rose. Sebastian Bach.
Bret Michaels is better than he is.

07:23.280 --> 07:26.241
Bret Michaels.
I'd rather listen to Bon... Jon Bon Jovi.

07:26.408 --> 07:27.576
What? Are you...?

07:27.743 --> 07:29.411
This is you.

07:35.209 --> 07:38.253
There's no smoking inside.

07:39.046 --> 07:43.050
And there's no swimming after 7.

07:46.094 --> 07:51.016
I hope it's okay to ask: What brings you
here from the West Coast, Mr. Farber?

07:51.183 --> 07:54.353
I've been hired to be the local film
and book critic for the paper.

07:54.520 --> 07:56.522
They flew you all the way
out here for that?

07:56.688 --> 08:01.026
- They did.
- Well, you must be very good.

08:19.836 --> 08:21.755
Mr. Heep, Betty Pen again.

08:21.922 --> 08:25.926
I smell something awful
coming from the upstairs apartment.

08:26.093 --> 08:31.348
I think someone may have died
and the body is decomposing.

08:31.515 --> 08:34.893
I know I said this last week, but...

08:45.612 --> 08:49.157
Not everyone here
spent Sunday practicing for war.

08:49.324 --> 08:53.370
At Sunday church services,
chaplains rallied the troops.

08:53.537 --> 08:56.081
For these Marines,
a moment for prayer...

08:56.248 --> 09:01.837
...at a service that many here believe
will be their last before going to war.

09:03.338 --> 09:07.176
U.S. Forces predicted today the enemy,
estimated at 3 to 4000...

09:07.342 --> 09:09.011
...may be willing...

09:15.767 --> 09:18.103
- a major... A major confrontation.

09:18.270 --> 09:23.025
At the same time, the U.S. Military
will be fighting a propaganda war.

09:23.192 --> 09:27.029
If there were a silver bullet,
we would've shot that a long time ago.

10:28.924 --> 10:31.468
Hey! I saw you!

10:31.635 --> 10:33.762
I saw you!

10:38.433 --> 10:41.103
Come out of that pool right now!

10:42.271 --> 10:43.814
Hey!

10:47.276 --> 10:48.986
I'm gonna wait.

10:52.823 --> 10:54.366
Hey.

10:58.912 --> 11:00.455
Hey.

11:04.042 --> 11:07.212
Come on out, now. It's...

11:08.463 --> 11:10.924
It's... It's not safe.

11:13.510 --> 11:16.221
Come on out. This is not f...

11:16.972 --> 11:19.057
This is not funny.

11:25.272 --> 11:27.274
Please sto...

11:55.677 --> 11:57.387
God.

13:03.245 --> 13:05.539
Did you pull me out?

13:13.088 --> 13:14.798
Where are you from?

13:15.090 --> 13:17.259
The Blue World.

13:17.509 --> 13:19.761
Is that an apartment?

13:21.013 --> 13:23.640
Do you feel an awakening?

13:24.600 --> 13:26.268
I'm sorry?

13:26.435 --> 13:29.897
It will feel like pins and needles...

13:30.564 --> 13:32.482
...inside.

13:36.486 --> 13:38.614
It is not you.

13:45.245 --> 13:46.872
It's late.

13:47.664 --> 13:49.416
You really...

13:52.085 --> 13:54.296
You shouldn't be here.

13:55.964 --> 13:59.176
I'm kind of old-fashioned that way.
I don't even know your name.

13:59.343 --> 14:01.053
My name is Story.

14:01.220 --> 14:03.388
I didn't mean for you to tell...

14:09.186 --> 14:11.188
Why am I not stuttering?

14:11.355 --> 14:12.814
What?

14:19.196 --> 14:22.074
Hello, Story, my name is Cleveland.

14:22.241 --> 14:24.201
"From the cliffs."

14:24.660 --> 14:27.329
That is what your name means.

14:27.496 --> 14:29.331
Where did you learn that?

14:29.498 --> 14:31.416
From my studies.

14:33.502 --> 14:38.715
I promise that I will not
get you into trouble. You can go.

14:40.509 --> 14:42.678
I am scared.

14:44.012 --> 14:47.224
I will wait here with you, Cleveland.

14:48.267 --> 14:50.269
Why are you scared?

15:03.156 --> 15:06.410
You can wait here for a little bit...

15:06.577 --> 15:09.204
...until you feel not so scared.

15:13.375 --> 15:15.210
Are you okay?

15:22.050 --> 15:25.179
Oh, my God. You're just a kid.

15:45.240 --> 15:46.783
Hello.

15:56.877 --> 16:02.132
Okay. It's time to go. Story, come on.

16:10.307 --> 16:11.808
Okay.

16:11.975 --> 16:14.520
I think you need some fresh air.

16:15.395 --> 16:16.855
I'm just gonna take you outside.

16:17.022 --> 16:19.316
I'm gonna put you
on one of the pool chairs.

16:19.483 --> 16:21.860
I'm gonna get you some coffee...

16:22.027 --> 16:24.279
...and then you can wake up.

16:25.614 --> 16:27.866
Then I'll walk you home.

16:36.208 --> 16:39.461
Tell me, who in the world
are you, anyway?

16:40.754 --> 16:44.049
- Narf.
- What?

16:49.805 --> 16:51.849
Okay. Come on.

16:52.307 --> 16:53.892
Here we go.

17:06.320 --> 17:07.865
Okay.

18:23.899 --> 18:29.780
It was sort of h... H... Hairy, but...
But matted, like clumps. You know?

18:29.947 --> 18:32.658
And it was kind of g... Green.

18:32.824 --> 18:34.785
- You say green?
- Yeah.

18:34.952 --> 18:38.455
I thought so. Matted is... Is not right.

18:38.622 --> 18:43.961
It was f... F... Flat, and...
And thicker than hair.

18:45.254 --> 18:49.466
Like this. Like this.
Flat and this kind of a color.

18:49.633 --> 18:54.930
- And... Is this not helping you at all?
- Forget about its hair for a second.

18:55.097 --> 18:58.934
It's obviously some dumb animal
who muddied himself. About how tall?

18:59.101 --> 19:01.687
- What, was it a Great Dane?
- No, no, no. No, sir.

19:01.854 --> 19:05.858
I mean, are there any w... W...
Wolves in this area? Hyenas?

19:06.024 --> 19:09.570
Jack, this is Philadelphia.
Where do you think you're living?

19:12.281 --> 19:15.450
Sorry. Something keeps
setting off the sprinklers.

19:15.617 --> 19:18.829
I'll look around the forest and check
behind the dumpsters and stuff.

19:18.996 --> 19:21.248
An animal that size,
the one you're describing...

19:21.415 --> 19:23.208
...doesn't walk around and not be seen.

19:23.375 --> 19:26.128
There's nowhere for
a dumb big animal to hide.

19:36.638 --> 19:37.681
Cleveland.

20:37.199 --> 20:38.825
Hey.

20:39.535 --> 20:41.370
Got a lot of homework, huh?

20:41.537 --> 20:44.039
University gives many pages of reading.

20:44.206 --> 20:47.042
What they think, I have no social life?

20:48.043 --> 20:50.045
I got more books for you.

20:50.212 --> 20:54.174
Could you look up
the word "narf" for me?

20:55.175 --> 20:59.012
It's an Eastern bedtime story, Mr. Heep.

20:59.179 --> 21:00.389
I do not remember it.

21:00.556 --> 21:03.517
My great-grandmother
used to tell it when she was alive.

21:03.684 --> 21:06.228
A b... B... B...

21:07.312 --> 21:09.565
Bedtime story?

21:09.731 --> 21:11.650
What's the story?

21:12.609 --> 21:14.862
I do not remember.

21:17.072 --> 21:19.074
How about your mother?

21:29.459 --> 21:33.547
Hello, Mrs. Choi. Hello.

21:39.928 --> 21:42.181
She wants to know
who told you this word.

21:42.347 --> 21:46.935
Oh, j... Just a friend. I don't...
I don't... I don't know her very well.

21:50.898 --> 21:53.483
She said that her grandmother...

21:53.650 --> 21:59.781
...used to tell this story like a prayer.
Like it was true.

22:00.908 --> 22:06.580
She said that she knew someone
who knew someone who saw one.

22:06.747 --> 22:08.540
Saw one what?

22:12.586 --> 22:16.924
A narf, the bedtime story says,
is a sea nymph.

22:20.219 --> 22:24.014
I s... What...
What happens in the story, please?

22:31.980 --> 22:33.982
No. Mrs...

22:42.366 --> 22:43.742
In the bedtime story...

22:45.452 --> 22:49.331
...she must be seen
by the one human chosen for her.

22:55.170 --> 22:58.507
This person is called the vessel.

22:58.715 --> 23:03.762
Seeing the narf will awaken something
in the chosen one.

23:03.971 --> 23:06.890
If she's successful in this...

23:08.517 --> 23:14.106
...she will return with the Great Eatlon,
a giant eagle...

23:14.314 --> 23:16.692
...and become free.

23:18.110 --> 23:20.320
She won't tell me more.

23:20.529 --> 23:24.408
She said, why can't I be like
my older sister. She married a dentist.

23:38.881 --> 23:40.591
Story?

23:42.676 --> 23:44.386
Story?

23:47.431 --> 23:49.057
Cleveland.

23:54.438 --> 23:58.025
Story, could you
put something back on, please?

24:08.827 --> 24:14.416
Are you here to meet someone,
see someone in this building?

24:18.462 --> 24:21.798
Is somebody supposed to see you?

24:26.512 --> 24:27.596
Is...?

24:30.891 --> 24:31.975
L...

24:37.356 --> 24:39.316
It is a writer.

24:45.822 --> 24:47.866
Do you know his name?

24:53.038 --> 24:55.332
Do you know what he looks like?

24:58.919 --> 25:02.840
Do you know if it's a...?
A woman or a man?

25:07.636 --> 25:10.472
Is there something
that you wanna tell me?

25:16.812 --> 25:21.525
Is this person
writing something important?

25:28.407 --> 25:30.367
When do you have to leave?

25:30.534 --> 25:34.454
I can leave tonight if I meet this person.

25:34.621 --> 25:36.915
I'm gonna help you get home.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.377
Thank you, Cleveland.

25:44.464 --> 25:46.258
I have to go.

25:51.763 --> 25:54.308
Hello. L... l...

25:54.892 --> 25:57.019
I wanted to ask you
something about your work.

25:57.186 --> 26:00.606
Your c... C... Critic work.

26:00.772 --> 26:04.526
How's it... How's... How's...
How's it going?

26:04.735 --> 26:09.615
I'm seeing a romance film tonight.
Not my cup of tea.

26:09.823 --> 26:12.367
So you... You...
You haven't written anything yet?

26:12.534 --> 26:14.328
Haven't written anything
for some time.

26:14.870 --> 26:17.414
You were right about that one tenant.

26:17.623 --> 26:19.750
I spoke with Mrs. Bell.

26:19.917 --> 26:23.670
We got along.
She's very good with animals.

26:24.755 --> 26:26.798
You know she wrote a book?

26:28.133 --> 26:31.970
Mr. Heep,
I will be taking the cat in directly.

26:32.554 --> 26:34.181
Don't worry, Mrs. Bell.

26:37.559 --> 26:39.269
Lookie here.

26:41.104 --> 26:44.775
My, there's a lot of butterflies
around this building.

26:45.734 --> 26:50.447
Strange behavior for them.
They're not usually so trusting.

26:52.199 --> 26:56.912
I understand that you're a writer,
Mrs. Bell.

26:57.079 --> 26:58.664
Now, where'd you hear such things?

26:59.456 --> 27:05.379
Maybe I read your book.

27:05.587 --> 27:09.341
That'd be quite a trick.
It's been out of print for 20 years.

27:09.550 --> 27:12.970
Twenty years?
So you haven't written anything recently?

27:13.178 --> 27:16.723
Mr. Farber has been speaking
out of turn.

27:20.143 --> 27:22.145
Look at this cereal character's picture,
Dad.

27:22.312 --> 27:26.567
Looks like Aunt Sylvia when she found out
everybody hated her fruit-bowl painting.

27:28.026 --> 27:32.406
I need a nine-letter word
for "in human form."

27:33.156 --> 27:35.492
You'll figure it out, Dad.

27:35.909 --> 27:37.494
I...

27:37.744 --> 27:42.207
You know, the color on this box
look just like the colors of your car, Dad.

27:42.374 --> 27:44.918
Maybe we should take your car
and go visit Aunt Sylvia.

27:45.085 --> 27:46.753
Incarnate.

27:49.214 --> 27:53.719
Well, you're very good
with those word puzzles, Mr. Dury.

27:53.886 --> 27:57.431
He's a grand-master level.
I'm gonna be just like him.

27:57.598 --> 28:00.726
- So you like words a lot, huh?
- I adore them.

28:00.893 --> 28:04.146
Are you... Are you writing anything,
Mr. Dury?

28:04.313 --> 28:05.814
A book, maybe?

28:05.981 --> 28:07.191
No, l...

28:07.357 --> 28:12.196
I'm afraid my skills are limited
to crossword puzzles.

28:13.697 --> 28:16.033
That's some serious reekage, man.

28:16.200 --> 28:18.744
You don't even speak English anymore.

28:18.952 --> 28:22.581
What, reekage? Damn straight
it's English. The state of reek.

28:22.748 --> 28:25.000
There's no "reekage," man.

28:25.167 --> 28:30.631
Some toker just like us made it up
somewhere, and here you are speaking it.

28:30.964 --> 28:35.052
Let's make up a witty phrase.
It'll become famous.

28:35.219 --> 28:38.347
It needs to be on some T-shirt
or something, you ass.

28:38.514 --> 28:43.852
No, it doesn't. It just catches on.
People just start saying it.

28:44.019 --> 28:45.938
Blim-blam.

28:46.104 --> 28:48.440
What? Blim-blam?

28:48.607 --> 28:50.692
Somebody already said that.

28:52.736 --> 28:56.573
Gentlemen, I don't suppose...

28:56.740 --> 29:01.537
...any of you have written
anything lately.

29:02.329 --> 29:06.917
An essay or something?

29:08.001 --> 29:10.712
Something important?

29:10.879 --> 29:12.714
No essays here, my man.

29:14.800 --> 29:19.388
Okay. Stop putting your clothes
in the garbage disposal...

29:19.555 --> 29:22.057
...and stop smoking.

29:29.356 --> 29:31.608
Baby's on the half-tip.

29:34.027 --> 29:35.279
- Snap!
- Yeah.

29:35.445 --> 29:37.865
There you go. There you go.

29:38.198 --> 29:39.241
Mr. Heep.

29:39.408 --> 29:42.703
She told me a little bit more of the story
before she throw cushion at me.

29:42.870 --> 29:44.079
Young-Soon.

29:44.788 --> 29:47.708
You're not writing anything, are you?

29:47.875 --> 29:51.378
A p... P... P... Paper, maybe?

29:51.545 --> 29:54.047
Writing? No, Mr. Heep.

29:54.214 --> 29:59.511
This semester all multiple-choice
courses. Young-Soon is not stupid.

30:01.013 --> 30:04.266
She told me about a bad guy in story.

30:04.433 --> 30:07.769
These creatures are called scrunts.

30:07.936 --> 30:11.648
They are meant to kill a narf
when she is out of the water.

30:11.815 --> 30:14.484
They can lay completely flat.

30:14.651 --> 30:17.362
Their back is covered in grass.

30:17.529 --> 30:21.200
My great-grandmother said
that's why man never sees them.

30:21.366 --> 30:24.661
They will appear
as a bump in the lawns.

31:15.546 --> 31:17.089
Vick. Anna.

31:17.256 --> 31:20.759
Mr. Heep, the light over my desk
is still not working.

31:20.926 --> 31:24.179
I promise I'll get to it.
How's the writing?

31:24.346 --> 31:27.975
- Slow.
- You look tired, Mr. Heep.

31:30.644 --> 31:33.105
How long have you been writing, Vick?

31:33.564 --> 31:35.440
Six months.

31:36.733 --> 31:38.902
What? I should finish, right?

31:39.069 --> 31:42.281
It just... It just sits on his desk.
My brother's scared.

31:42.447 --> 31:44.324
He'll do anything to get out of writing.

31:44.491 --> 31:47.828
See this? It's the third load of laundry
he's done this week.

31:49.454 --> 31:52.082
I can fix that light now, if you want.

32:35.584 --> 32:37.336
A cookbook.

32:39.838 --> 32:42.549
This has gotten s... S...

32:45.844 --> 32:47.554
Silly.

32:51.725 --> 32:54.770
- That's not how you fold.
- Mr. Heep, tell her to stop annoying me.

32:54.937 --> 32:56.188
I fixed the light.

32:56.355 --> 32:58.315
I'll make you dinner, Mr. Heep.
Thank you.

32:58.482 --> 32:59.900
You're both cooks?

33:00.067 --> 33:04.279
Who, him? He can't cook.
He's banned from the kitchen.

33:10.327 --> 33:12.329
Wait a minute,
I don't understand something.

33:12.496 --> 33:15.040
I'm sorry. My... My ladder...

33:15.749 --> 33:18.877
...accidentally bumped into your desk.

33:19.044 --> 33:22.589
I ended up seeing the title
of what it is you're writing.

33:22.756 --> 33:24.424
It said The Cookbook.

33:24.591 --> 33:26.844
I know, it's a bad title, right?

33:27.010 --> 33:32.140
It's actually, you know, just my thoughts
on all our cultural problems...

33:32.307 --> 33:34.518
...and thoughts on leaders and stuff.

33:34.685 --> 33:37.688
I don't know who's gonna
wanna publish the thing.

33:39.356 --> 33:41.733
That is not how you fold.

33:53.328 --> 33:55.831
Your thoughts are very sad.

33:59.334 --> 34:01.920
Most are of one night.

34:03.589 --> 34:07.551
A night a man entered your home
when you were not there.

34:09.887 --> 34:13.389
He stole many things
and killed your wife and children.

34:14.558 --> 34:17.518
That is when you stopped being happy.

34:20.522 --> 34:22.565
You were a doctor.

34:25.068 --> 34:27.737
I am very sorry for you.

34:28.906 --> 34:32.159
You believe you have no purpose.

34:32.576 --> 34:34.911
You help all that live here.

34:35.078 --> 34:37.956
Anybody can do this job, Story.

34:38.123 --> 34:40.417
You have a purpose.

34:41.293 --> 34:44.004
All beings have a purpose.

34:50.260 --> 34:52.262
I know who you are.

34:53.472 --> 34:57.267
And I think that I've found your vessel.

34:57.601 --> 35:00.354
You know what I'm talking about, right?

35:03.065 --> 35:05.442
He's outside.
Do you need to see him alone...

35:05.609 --> 35:07.903
...or does he just need to see you?

35:18.288 --> 35:20.415
Cover yourself up.

35:24.962 --> 35:26.213
Hey.

35:26.380 --> 35:28.966
Mr. Heep, I know I sent in that form.

35:29.132 --> 35:31.510
- I gave it to you on the stairs.
- Okay.

35:32.344 --> 35:35.973
- My sister's all angry at me now.
- Well, I'll check again.

35:37.474 --> 35:40.143
By the way, this is my friend, Story.

35:43.313 --> 35:44.815
Hi.

36:00.497 --> 36:03.041
Yeah, you were right. Here it is.

36:04.376 --> 36:05.836
Great.

36:09.214 --> 36:12.134
You all right? You look a little...

36:15.804 --> 36:18.098
I'm feeling a little funny. It's nothing.

36:18.849 --> 36:22.603
Is it a pins-and-needles kind of feeling?

36:24.062 --> 36:25.856
Yeah, kind of.

36:27.941 --> 36:29.484
Yeah.

36:31.236 --> 36:33.530
Maybe you should go lie down.

36:39.536 --> 36:41.205
Nice meeting you.

36:41.371 --> 36:45.292
I'm so very happy we saw each other.

37:07.689 --> 37:10.817
You don't have to leave right now,
do you?

37:11.985 --> 37:15.239
I have to go finish a couple of things.
I'll be back.

37:15.405 --> 37:17.032
Is that okay?

37:17.199 --> 37:19.827
Your words are very beautiful.

37:20.410 --> 37:24.414
Your heart is very big.

37:34.925 --> 37:38.178
No one knows about my family here.

37:40.222 --> 37:45.185
Please do not bring it up again.

37:57.072 --> 37:58.657
Coming.

37:59.992 --> 38:04.746
Sorry I'm late, Mrs. Bubchik.
It's... It's been a long day.

38:04.913 --> 38:06.290
Come on.

38:08.792 --> 38:12.421
Listen, he's on the toilet.
He's been having some gas issues.

38:12.588 --> 38:13.797
Don't tell him I told you.

38:13.964 --> 38:16.884
L... I thought the toilet was broken.
That's why I came.

38:17.050 --> 38:21.722
He may just be looking in the mirror.
I mean, he's got this growth on his ass.

38:21.889 --> 38:24.641
Don't tell him I told you.

38:26.226 --> 38:29.813
Honey, Cleveland's here.
He's come to fix the toilet.

38:29.980 --> 38:33.025
Tell him I had it fixed already.
I called the plumber this morning.

38:33.192 --> 38:36.320
- Don't let it hurt his feelings.
- Right.

38:36.987 --> 38:39.740
It's... It's... It's okay.

38:39.907 --> 38:43.494
I should come when you call.
It's my job.

38:45.120 --> 38:48.248
What if that thing's out there?
It'll try to get you?

38:48.415 --> 38:51.251
There are laws. It will be safe.

38:51.418 --> 38:54.004
I'm allowed to leave this night.

39:03.138 --> 39:05.724
- How long do you think?
- It is time.

39:05.891 --> 39:07.184
You must not watch.

39:07.351 --> 39:09.811
Am I not allowed to watch you leave?

39:10.812 --> 39:12.064
I won't watch.

39:12.231 --> 39:15.359
Thank you for letting me wear
your beautiful shirt.

39:15.526 --> 39:17.194
You keep it.

40:48.660 --> 40:50.579
What happened?

40:51.955 --> 40:54.541
Okay. Okay.

40:54.708 --> 40:59.296
Hey. Calm down. Calm down.

40:59.463 --> 41:01.590
How'd you get those scratches?

41:02.549 --> 41:04.843
Did the eagle come?

41:06.720 --> 41:09.598
Did something go wrong? Story.

41:09.765 --> 41:13.185
Story. Was it that dog again?

41:20.484 --> 41:23.237
What's happening?
I thought it was gonna be safe.

41:35.999 --> 41:40.170
Your face doesn't look right.
Are you okay?

41:42.464 --> 41:44.800
Mr. Heep is here. He has a friend.

41:44.967 --> 41:46.760
She's beautiful.

41:46.927 --> 41:49.179
She's not feeling that well:

41:49.346 --> 41:51.181
So she's lying down in my room.

41:51.348 --> 41:53.767
Why is she here?
Why isn't she at his place?

41:53.934 --> 41:57.104
Well, she got sick
in the stairwell downstairs.

41:58.230 --> 42:02.526
She's wearing no clothes
under his shirt.

42:02.693 --> 42:04.111
Blim-blam.

42:05.904 --> 42:09.241
Mr. Heep is a player.

42:16.373 --> 42:19.209
- I hope it's all right.
- It's fine.

42:19.376 --> 42:21.086
Do we need to take her to a hospital?

42:21.253 --> 42:24.047
- Oh, no. No, no, no. That's f... F... F...
- Fine?

42:24.923 --> 42:26.842
Thank you.

42:27.885 --> 42:29.511
No, she just needs some rest.

42:29.678 --> 42:32.014
She can stay here
as long as she needs to.

42:33.390 --> 42:35.684
You started writing again?

42:37.728 --> 42:39.229
Yeah.

42:39.813 --> 42:42.399
I'll be right back. Okay?

42:50.824 --> 42:55.204
Hello. M... Mrs. Choi,
is Young-Soon at home?

42:55.370 --> 42:56.747
No home.

42:56.914 --> 42:59.666
Great. Unbelievable.

43:05.839 --> 43:08.342
Hey. Hey.

43:10.511 --> 43:12.054
Thanks.

43:13.096 --> 43:15.599
- Yeah, hello?
- Mr. Heep?

43:15.766 --> 43:18.268
- Where are you?
- At a club.

43:18.435 --> 43:20.979
Don 't tell my mother.
She thinks I'm at a dance class.

43:21.146 --> 43:22.439
Okay.

43:22.814 --> 43:26.109
What happens if a narf gets scratched?

43:26.276 --> 43:30.280
I don 't know.
Put my mother on, I'll ask her.

43:31.740 --> 43:34.117
Mrs... Mrs. Choi. Mrs...

43:48.799 --> 43:51.218
- Hey.
- Hey. Thank you.

43:52.386 --> 43:55.055
Oh, she... She... She...
She doesn't look happy.

43:55.264 --> 43:57.850
She said the story
her grandmother told...

43:58.058 --> 44:01.228
...said a scrunt has poison
that kill narfs.

44:01.395 --> 44:05.649
But she said
narfs can protect themselves.

44:05.816 --> 44:09.570
They are given a mud called Kii
that cures them.

44:09.736 --> 44:12.072
They keep it where they live.

44:12.489 --> 44:14.992
Okay, okay.

44:15.200 --> 44:21.331
All right. Now, you said that the eagle
comes to take them back.

44:21.540 --> 44:24.334
Right.
Now, what stops this green thing...

44:24.543 --> 44:28.672
...from attacking them
when the eagle comes?

44:28.881 --> 44:30.424
You're funny, Mr. Heep.

44:30.632 --> 44:32.885
- Yeah, I know.
- You really thought about this.

44:33.093 --> 44:35.262
Put my mom on.

44:56.950 --> 44:59.703
- Hey.
- Yeah. Hey. I'm sorry.

45:00.287 --> 45:01.497
Yes?

45:01.705 --> 45:04.708
She said only a rogue scrunt
will break the law of that night...

45:04.917 --> 45:06.710
...because most scrunts are afraid.

45:06.919 --> 45:08.629
Afraid of what?

45:08.837 --> 45:13.634
Tartutic. They are the law keepers
in this bedtime story.

45:13.842 --> 45:16.678
Her grandmother said
there are three of them...

45:16.845 --> 45:19.973
...but they are called one name:
Tartutic.

45:20.182 --> 45:24.394
They live in the trees.
They are said to look like monkeys.

45:24.853 --> 45:29.983
No one knows for sure because
no one who has seen them has lived.

45:30.192 --> 45:34.238
The legend says
that they were born so evil...

45:34.404 --> 45:37.908
...that they killed their parents
on the night they were born.

45:38.116 --> 45:43.330
The fear of them has kept justice
in The Blue World for centuries.

45:43.539 --> 45:45.499
Bye, Mr. Heep.

45:52.089 --> 45:53.549
Thanks.

46:11.149 --> 46:14.903
They are given a mud called Kii
that cures them.

46:15.112 --> 46:17.406
They keep it where they live.

49:16.668 --> 49:20.005
My mom figured out I was at a club.
She made me come home.

49:20.172 --> 49:21.965
She tell me more of the story.

49:22.132 --> 49:24.843
- Why you wet?
- That's... Apartment business.

49:27.054 --> 49:31.433
Listen, Mr. Heep,
my mother thinks of you as stranger.

49:31.725 --> 49:35.229
You have to make her
see you as a child, innocent.

49:35.395 --> 49:38.357
Then she will tell you the bedtime story.

49:38.649 --> 49:41.109
There is a reason
the rules might be broken.

49:42.236 --> 49:44.988
A Thousand Narfs is about a rare narf...

49:45.155 --> 49:47.533
...who comes once
in a generation of narfs...

49:47.699 --> 49:50.702
...who is called the Madam Narf.

49:50.869 --> 49:54.373
Her vessel is important.
This vessel will cause change.

49:54.540 --> 49:59.378
But it is the Madam Narf herself
that is truly the key.

49:59.545 --> 50:03.048
She's considered
a queen to her people.

50:03.215 --> 50:06.969
Her return will be seen
as a great inspiration.

50:07.135 --> 50:10.681
A scrunt will do anything
to kill a Madam Narf...

50:10.848 --> 50:13.559
...even forget his fears of the Tartutic.

50:13.725 --> 50:17.104
He might break the rules for that,
Mr. Heep.

50:17.980 --> 50:20.691
Will she know
that she's a Madam Narf?

50:20.858 --> 50:24.486
No, that is moral of bedtime story.

50:24.653 --> 50:27.698
No one is ever told who they are.

50:27.865 --> 50:29.825
I think we are linked.

50:29.992 --> 50:32.536
It's more than just a story to me too.

50:32.703 --> 50:35.205
I actually want to believe it.

50:36.373 --> 50:38.083
Goodbye, Mr. Heep.

50:54.433 --> 50:57.019
You have saved my life again.

50:58.812 --> 51:00.981
You made that room.

51:03.442 --> 51:07.446
The cracks that I saw. Is that room
supposed to collapse eventually?

51:07.613 --> 51:11.074
I'm not allowed to speak
of The Blue World.

51:11.241 --> 51:13.952
Well, the door needs a little work.

51:16.413 --> 51:20.083
I noticed that you took things
from the apartment...

51:20.250 --> 51:22.794
...that people left around the pool.

51:24.129 --> 51:28.967
That's how I saw you.
You were taking something off of a chair.

51:35.724 --> 51:39.353
I think I might know why
the scrunt needs to get you so bad.

51:39.520 --> 51:42.231
Why did he break the rules tonight?

51:42.397 --> 51:46.401
As it turns out,
I think that you're someone...

51:46.819 --> 51:50.447
...very important to everyone.

52:29.486 --> 52:33.198
I tried to tell them about you.
I don't know if I did the right thing.

52:33.740 --> 52:36.201
I'm not sure how they're gonna react.

52:36.368 --> 52:38.328
I trust you.

52:38.620 --> 52:41.373
I believe you are here to protect me.

52:45.711 --> 52:47.546
Is the Kii working?

52:47.713 --> 52:49.756
Yes, thank you.

52:50.716 --> 52:53.677
If it is true that I am...

52:53.844 --> 52:56.180
He will keep coming after me.

52:56.346 --> 52:59.141
I will not be safe until...

52:59.308 --> 53:01.643
Until Tartutic comes.

53:15.866 --> 53:18.827
My mother said she saw a ghost once,
in the basement.

53:18.994 --> 53:21.622
I was the only one who believed her.

53:21.788 --> 53:24.249
She's not an apparition, Anna.

53:25.959 --> 53:28.337
I don't know who you are...

53:29.546 --> 53:32.007
...but you did something to me.

53:34.259 --> 53:36.178
My thoughts.

53:40.265 --> 53:42.768
Everything became clearer.

53:43.936 --> 53:48.106
The fears that were muddling
my thoughts just went away.

53:48.899 --> 53:51.026
I can hear myself.

53:53.445 --> 53:56.073
Do you wish to know your future?

54:01.954 --> 54:05.165
A boy in the Midwest of this land...

54:05.332 --> 54:09.753
...will grow up in a home where your book
will be on the shelf and spoken of often.

54:09.920 --> 54:13.131
He will grow up
with these ideas in his head.

54:13.549 --> 54:16.635
He will grow into a great orator.

54:17.219 --> 54:20.180
He will speak and his words
will be heard throughout this land...

54:20.347 --> 54:22.641
...and throughout the world.

54:23.433 --> 54:27.729
This boy will become
leader of this country...

54:27.896 --> 54:30.774
...and begin a movement
of great change.

54:31.525 --> 54:34.570
He will speak of you and your words.

54:35.279 --> 54:39.158
Your book will be the seeds
of many of his great thoughts.

54:41.326 --> 54:43.996
It will be the seeds of change.

54:46.582 --> 54:48.625
The Cookbook?

54:56.675 --> 54:59.511
One, two, three.

55:33.670 --> 55:35.380
Oh, jeez.

55:44.181 --> 55:49.228
Could you tell her that I was interested
in hearing more of the story?

56:21.844 --> 56:24.888
Tell her it's a beautiful story.

56:26.223 --> 56:29.560
Are there... Are there any parts
that might be good to hear?

56:53.208 --> 56:55.252
- How is she?
- The medicine's helping her.

56:55.419 --> 56:58.338
I told her to stay under the shower.
She does better with water.

56:58.505 --> 57:01.550
I need to talk with her.
And Vick should be there too.

57:03.051 --> 57:07.389
I told them to wait right outside.
I'll tell them what you have to say.

57:08.182 --> 57:11.768
Tell her I know that she is not allowed
to tell about her world...

57:11.935 --> 57:16.231
...but maybe I could ask some questions,
and she can just say if it's right or wrong.

57:16.899 --> 57:20.944
Know what I did when I was little and me
and my girlfriends would get in trouble?

57:21.111 --> 57:23.280
My mom always wanted to know
what happened...

57:23.447 --> 57:25.657
...but I was like,
"I can't tell on my friends."

57:25.824 --> 57:30.245
So she came up with this way
of me telling her things without talking.

57:30.412 --> 57:34.458
She would say, "Touch your ear
or something if the answer is yes."

57:34.625 --> 57:37.169
So I would, and then
she would know certain things...

57:37.336 --> 57:40.339
...but I didn't really feel
like I told on my friends.

57:41.465 --> 57:45.052
It was cheating, I know,
but made me feel better.

57:45.636 --> 57:46.762
We're ready.

57:49.848 --> 57:52.976
So in this bedtime story...

57:53.143 --> 57:56.313
...the narf has come
to a preordained place.

57:56.480 --> 58:00.025
She must leave from the same spot.

58:00.192 --> 58:02.945
This eagle, the Great Eatlon,
coming to take her back...

58:03.111 --> 58:04.655
...is really very important.

58:04.822 --> 58:06.824
And here's the good stuff.

58:06.990 --> 58:10.911
There are humans
with powers that can help her.

58:11.078 --> 58:13.622
And these people
have been unconsciously drawn...

58:13.789 --> 58:15.958
...to live near the vessel.

58:16.124 --> 58:18.669
Now, these humans
don't know who they are...

58:18.836 --> 58:22.047
...and they always
appear in the story earlier.

58:22.214 --> 58:25.008
Are there humans with powers
that can help you...

58:25.175 --> 58:26.760
...but don't know who they are?

58:28.303 --> 58:29.346
That's a yes!

58:31.473 --> 58:36.144
They've got weird names:
A Symbolist, a Guardian and a Guild.

58:36.311 --> 58:37.479
Ask her if that's right.

58:40.732 --> 58:42.860
You want something.

58:43.694 --> 58:46.405
One of them. Vick.

58:46.572 --> 58:51.285
Mr. Heep. Mr. Heep is one of them.

58:52.536 --> 58:55.330
Which one? Guild, Guardian?

58:57.499 --> 58:59.751
She thinks Mr. Heep is the Guardian.

59:01.336 --> 59:04.506
I was told that there's a Symbolist...

59:04.673 --> 59:08.051
...an interpreter who can read signs
in clouds and other forms.

59:08.218 --> 59:10.554
He will interpret messages...

59:11.555 --> 59:14.349
...from the universe
if problems should arise.

59:14.516 --> 59:17.644
Do you know who the Symbolist
or Interpreter is?

59:18.103 --> 59:20.063
That's a no.

59:21.690 --> 59:24.234
And I was told that there is a Guild...

59:24.401 --> 59:27.196
...whose many hands
will combine to help.

59:27.362 --> 59:29.281
Does she know who they are?

59:29.448 --> 59:31.658
There is a Guild or something.

59:31.825 --> 59:34.620
They're supposed to help
with their hands.

59:35.329 --> 59:37.247
That's another no.

59:38.916 --> 59:40.250
All right, there's one other.

59:40.417 --> 59:44.046
I don't know if it's worth mentioning.
It's not in the stories all the time.

59:44.213 --> 59:47.716
It's a human, usually a female...

59:47.883 --> 59:49.593
...so full of hope...

59:49.760 --> 59:54.598
...that they can awaken
the life force in all things.

59:54.765 --> 59:56.934
Now, that one is called the Healer.

59:57.100 --> 59:59.269
And you can tell
that they're in the story...

59:59.436 --> 01:00:02.397
...because butterflies
are drawn to the Healer.

01:00:04.316 --> 01:00:07.027
- Butterflies.
- The last one's a Healer.

01:00:07.194 --> 01:00:09.780
You don't know
any of these people, do you?

01:00:15.452 --> 01:00:18.622
Reading? A book?

01:00:18.789 --> 01:00:20.707
Learning.

01:00:22.501 --> 01:00:24.711
She thinks it has to be learned.

01:00:24.878 --> 01:00:27.172
Is the eagle
going to come back for her?

01:00:30.551 --> 01:00:32.010
Only one last time.

01:00:32.553 --> 01:00:34.680
Mr. Heep,
you know the people in this building.

01:00:34.847 --> 01:00:36.473
You have to find them.

01:00:43.939 --> 01:00:45.482
What is it?

01:00:45.649 --> 01:00:47.860
You know these walls are paper-thin?

01:00:48.026 --> 01:00:51.405
I can hear all that bloody noise
downstairs like they were in my kitchen.

01:00:51.572 --> 01:00:53.866
Can you do anything about that?

01:00:55.784 --> 01:00:57.536
Of course not.

01:00:58.162 --> 01:01:02.291
- What is it you want, anyway?
- Well, I had a question.

01:01:02.457 --> 01:01:06.461
You're an expert on p... P... Plots, right?

01:01:06.628 --> 01:01:11.425
You know who's gonna do what in a book
or a movie even at the beginning, yes?

01:01:11.592 --> 01:01:14.970
There is no originality left in the world,
Mr. Heep.

01:01:15.137 --> 01:01:17.181
That is a sad fact I've come to live with.

01:01:17.347 --> 01:01:21.894
Well, if there was a mystery...

01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:25.439
...and a guy had to figure out
who some people were...

01:01:25.606 --> 01:01:28.859
...like he had to find a symbol guy...

01:01:29.026 --> 01:01:32.196
...someone who can
figure out messages...

01:01:32.362 --> 01:01:38.285
...and a guild of people who are going
to be important at the end as a group.

01:01:38.785 --> 01:01:41.163
How would you figure that out?

01:01:42.414 --> 01:01:45.250
The symbol person should be simple.

01:01:45.667 --> 01:01:49.171
Look for any character
who is doing something mundane...

01:01:49.338 --> 01:01:51.048
...but required analysis.

01:01:51.215 --> 01:01:54.593
Someone who was skilled at puzzles.

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:57.054
Joey, you can't have cereal for lunch.

01:01:57.221 --> 01:02:01.308
This picture on the cereal box
is supposed to make you feel happy.

01:02:01.725 --> 01:02:05.729
I feel sad, like that time
you forgot to pick me up at school.

01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:11.485
Joey, Mr. Heep appears disquieted.
Can you give us a moment alone?

01:02:12.236 --> 01:02:14.154
Sure, Dad.

01:02:15.739 --> 01:02:17.616
As for the guild...

01:02:17.783 --> 01:02:20.911
...Iook for any group of characters
that are always seen together...

01:02:21.078 --> 01:02:23.956
...and have seemingly irrelevant
and tedious dialogue...

01:02:24.122 --> 01:02:26.416
...that seems to regurgitate forever.

01:02:26.583 --> 01:02:29.962
And you just sit around
and talk about nothing?

01:02:30.128 --> 01:02:33.006
Oh, we talk about serious issues.

01:02:33.173 --> 01:02:34.925
On occasion.

01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:42.266
We talked about Martin Luther King
at the Tequila Hut Tuesday night.

01:02:44.268 --> 01:02:45.644
You talked about that?

01:02:45.811 --> 01:02:48.772
This is the writer's way
of establishing characters...

01:02:48.939 --> 01:02:51.817
...who will be important
further in the story.

01:02:52.192 --> 01:02:55.320
Is there anything further
I can assist you with during my naptime?

01:02:55.487 --> 01:02:59.324
No. No, Mr. Farber. Thank you.

01:03:14.715 --> 01:03:17.801
Story, these young men are the Guild.

01:03:17.968 --> 01:03:21.013
And Mr. Dury... Mr. Dury?

01:03:22.347 --> 01:03:25.058
Mr. Dury is the Interpreter.

01:03:26.393 --> 01:03:30.272
And there's one other person.
Mrs. Bell, could you come in here, please?

01:03:30.981 --> 01:03:34.735
This is Mrs. Bell, the Healer.

01:03:36.111 --> 01:03:39.281
Story wants to go home and she can't.

01:03:39.448 --> 01:03:41.992
Tomorrow night is her last chance.

01:03:42.826 --> 01:03:45.037
Mr. Dury, please step forward.

01:03:45.204 --> 01:03:49.625
- Mr. Heep, you're not stuttering.
- Yes, I know. I know. It's only around her.

01:03:52.544 --> 01:03:56.632
Now, the Interpreter will tell us what
to do if something should go wrong.

01:03:56.798 --> 01:04:00.761
He will use an instrument
specific to him...

01:04:00.928 --> 01:04:02.804
...to interpret.

01:04:04.348 --> 01:04:06.183
- Try it, Mr. Dury.
- I don't...

01:04:06.350 --> 01:04:08.852
Let's just see what happens.

01:04:09.436 --> 01:04:12.439
I think that there's
a message in there for us.

01:04:17.027 --> 01:04:21.990
Well, nine letters across
is the word "essential."

01:04:24.117 --> 01:04:26.870
And it touches...

01:04:27.371 --> 01:04:31.959
...27 down, which is "scheme."

01:04:32.125 --> 01:04:34.419
- Essential scheme.
- Yes.

01:04:34.586 --> 01:04:37.881
Now, those were the first two words
that I deciphered in this puzzle...

01:04:38.048 --> 01:04:41.426
...and I thought that was...
Well, I thought that was weird.

01:04:46.139 --> 01:04:48.308
There's a word that seems
out of place to me.

01:04:48.475 --> 01:04:52.062
- Yes.
- It's a six-letter word for "get-together."

01:04:52.229 --> 01:04:54.106
- "Soiree."
- Soiree.

01:04:54.857 --> 01:04:57.901
Soiree could mean "party." How
could a...? How does a party help us?

01:04:58.068 --> 01:05:00.863
Well, I guess I thought that, you know...

01:05:01.029 --> 01:05:06.201
...a party is interesting because
this thing out there is an animal...

01:05:06.368 --> 01:05:08.954
...and it probably has
a very keen sense of smell.

01:05:09.121 --> 01:05:12.958
- Why is everyone staring at me?
- Go on. Go on, Mr. Dury. Go on.

01:05:13.125 --> 01:05:16.879
Humans have a pungent smell
to animals...

01:05:17.045 --> 01:05:20.424
...so I thought that maybe everyone
gathered together would confuse him...

01:05:20.591 --> 01:05:24.344
...and he wouldn't be able to distinguish
her from amongst all of us.

01:05:24.511 --> 01:05:25.596
Does that sound right?

01:05:25.762 --> 01:05:28.390
He's hearing the voice of God
through a crossword puzzle.

01:05:28.557 --> 01:05:31.602
- We're just playing here, right?
- No. Wait, wait.

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:36.356
See, I don't think that the Great Eatlon...

01:05:36.523 --> 01:05:40.319
...will land in the presence
of beings not from its world.

01:05:40.652 --> 01:05:43.572
She didn't want me to watch
when the eagle came the first time.

01:05:43.739 --> 01:05:45.866
That's before she knew
that I was the Guardian.

01:05:46.033 --> 01:05:47.784
Would I be able to watch now?

01:05:49.578 --> 01:05:52.956
But there will be...
There'll be hundreds of people at a party.

01:05:53.123 --> 01:05:56.793
It won't work. It won't work. See if
there's anything else in there, Mr. Dury.

01:05:58.337 --> 01:06:01.465
This word did give me great difficulty,
and then it came to me.

01:06:01.632 --> 01:06:05.135
- "Sonorous."
- Sonorous, sonorous.

01:06:05.302 --> 01:06:08.263
It could mean music, a band.

01:06:08.430 --> 01:06:12.851
Maybe we gather everyone inside
at the last minute to hear a band...

01:06:13.018 --> 01:06:16.480
...and we who are of the world
stay with her...

01:06:16.647 --> 01:06:20.442
...to help her with that thing and...

01:06:20.609 --> 01:06:22.361
Until she's taken.

01:06:23.445 --> 01:06:25.155
He's a prophet.

01:06:25.322 --> 01:06:28.492
We're all just seeing what we want to.
I just made all that up.

01:06:28.659 --> 01:06:31.370
No, I think that it worked.
I think that it worked.

01:06:31.537 --> 01:06:34.248
That is why they're the Guild.

01:06:34.414 --> 01:06:38.460
I think they're supposed
to use their hands to throw us a party.

01:06:38.627 --> 01:06:41.088
- Is he serious?
- We're gonna throw a party.

01:06:41.797 --> 01:06:45.342
- Huge party. We are serious.
- Tell them...

01:06:45.509 --> 01:06:48.637
Anything you can do for us,
all right? Tables...

01:06:48.804 --> 01:06:52.349
We definitely need a band. It's like
the most important thing. Oh, my God.

01:06:59.189 --> 01:07:02.067
You don't think this is gonna work,
do you?

01:07:03.861 --> 01:07:05.863
I'm nervous too.

01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:09.449
You being out there tomorrow night.

01:07:09.908 --> 01:07:13.120
Me not knowing what to do
as the Guardian.

01:07:15.414 --> 01:07:19.543
Think I can go out there tonight
and maybe face that thing without you?

01:07:20.752 --> 01:07:23.088
Get a little practice with him?

01:07:23.255 --> 01:07:25.215
Scare him, maybe?

01:07:25.382 --> 01:07:27.384
Show him who's boss?

01:07:31.013 --> 01:07:33.432
I know you wanna get home.

01:07:42.691 --> 01:07:44.818
You will need a mirror.

01:07:45.652 --> 01:07:48.113
Can you hear me? I'm here.

01:07:48.572 --> 01:07:50.866
Peer over your shoulder carefully.

01:07:51.033 --> 01:07:55.746
It is only through a mirror that one can
see the eyes of a scrunt in the grass.

01:07:55.913 --> 01:08:00.792
It will appear to you
as two red spots in the darkness.

01:08:02.419 --> 01:08:04.880
Yeah, l... I don 't... I...

01:08:06.465 --> 01:08:08.008
Wait.

01:08:08.550 --> 01:08:10.385
I see him.

01:08:13.514 --> 01:08:16.183
The Guardian has instincts
of when the scrunt will attack.

01:08:16.350 --> 01:08:19.185
He is a great weapon against him.

01:08:19.853 --> 01:08:24.024
You should walk backwards
towards him.

01:08:24.191 --> 01:08:27.277
When you are close enough
to be certain of his position...

01:08:27.444 --> 01:08:30.029
...turn and face the hidden scrunt.

01:08:34.618 --> 01:08:36.578
I'm facing him.

01:08:37.703 --> 01:08:39.665
I am scared.

01:08:40.122 --> 01:08:42.917
It is about to get very dangerous.

01:08:43.210 --> 01:08:45.002
Okay.

01:08:46.796 --> 01:08:48.590
I'm ready.

01:08:49.550 --> 01:08:54.638
You must invoke the ancient words
"Nef Ra Mora."

01:08:54.805 --> 01:09:00.102
It is a command to rise
and a challenge to fight.

01:09:09.194 --> 01:09:11.071
What is happening?

01:09:12.990 --> 01:09:15.158
He's rising out of the grass.

01:09:16.618 --> 01:09:19.955
His legs are bending and coiling...

01:09:20.831 --> 01:09:22.582
...underneath him.

01:09:22.875 --> 01:09:27.045
Oh, my God. Oh, my... Oh, no.

01:09:27.754 --> 01:09:29.214
He's standing in front of me.

01:09:29.381 --> 01:09:31.091
The Guardian can hypnotize a scrunt.

01:09:31.258 --> 01:09:33.844
If the Guardian looks directly
into the scrunt's eyes...

01:09:34.011 --> 01:09:37.639
...it will be compelled to stay frozen
or move backwards.

01:09:38.182 --> 01:09:41.018
What is the J.G. Scrunt's reaction?
Is he frightened?

01:09:41.185 --> 01:09:42.685
I'm not sure.

01:09:42.853 --> 01:09:44.979
- Look into his eyes.
- I am.

01:09:45.147 --> 01:09:47.733
- Is he moving away?
- No.

01:09:47.899 --> 01:09:50.027
The Guardian can control his mind.

01:09:50.194 --> 01:09:53.071
The J.G. Scrunt will not
be able to attack.

01:09:53.363 --> 01:09:58.035
- Okay.
- You must look into his eyes.

01:09:58.202 --> 01:09:59.953
I think something's wrong.

01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:02.206
He's stepping forward.

01:10:02.831 --> 01:10:04.416
He's stepping forward?

01:10:04.583 --> 01:10:06.585
Something's wrong!

01:10:09.004 --> 01:10:11.548
Cleveland, run!

01:10:17.471 --> 01:10:20.807
What is it you are doing?

01:10:22.392 --> 01:10:24.144
Hey there.

01:10:25.979 --> 01:10:31.026
Anything I can do for you there,
Mr. F... F... F... Farber?

01:10:31.485 --> 01:10:32.986
No.

01:10:39.952 --> 01:10:43.747
So how was the m... Movie?

01:10:43.914 --> 01:10:45.582
- Sucked.
- Oh, what a... What a shame.

01:10:45.749 --> 01:10:49.419
Characters were walking around
saying their thoughts out loud.

01:10:49.586 --> 01:10:51.171
Who does that?

01:10:51.338 --> 01:10:52.589
And a typical romance...

01:10:52.756 --> 01:10:56.969
...where the couple finally tell each other
they love one another in the rain.

01:10:57.678 --> 01:11:01.765
Why does everyone like to stand around
and talk in the rain in movies?

01:11:02.349 --> 01:11:04.518
Well, maybe...

01:11:04.935 --> 01:11:09.148
Maybe it's a metaphor for purification,
starting new.

01:11:10.274 --> 01:11:13.110
No. It's not.

01:11:13.610 --> 01:11:15.529
Are you okay?

01:11:17.281 --> 01:11:20.409
He'll choose to move
only when no one is looking.

01:11:20.576 --> 01:11:22.703
They're masters of hiding.

01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:26.790
A scrunt will hide unless
he cannot hide in his environment.

01:11:26.957 --> 01:11:30.002
If a tenant hadn't walked by...

01:11:30.169 --> 01:11:32.796
...I'd have been eaten alive.

01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:37.176
I had no powers over him.

01:11:37.342 --> 01:11:39.761
You are not the Guardian.

01:11:41.263 --> 01:11:43.724
I do not understand.

01:11:49.980 --> 01:11:52.524
I cannot protect you.

01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:55.777
Where are the Tartutic?

01:11:55.944 --> 01:11:58.322
Why isn't he being punished?

01:11:59.114 --> 01:12:01.617
Where is the justice?

01:12:20.427 --> 01:12:22.888
How come you don't ask
about bedtime story anymore?

01:12:27.184 --> 01:12:28.852
I've been busy.

01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:37.569
You... You coming to the party tonight?

01:12:37.945 --> 01:12:39.780
I have to study.

01:12:39.947 --> 01:12:41.782
Bye, Mr. Heep.

01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:51.625
Mr. Leeds,
did you hear about the p... Party?

01:12:56.088 --> 01:12:57.339
You coming?

01:12:57.506 --> 01:12:59.383
- A picture here
of the enemy they're...

01:12:59.550 --> 01:13:01.885
Does man deserve to be saved,
Mr. Heep?

01:13:02.052 --> 01:13:04.179
- What?
- Man.

01:13:07.683 --> 01:13:09.184
Yes.

01:13:09.643 --> 01:13:11.436
That's not the answer I expected.

01:13:11.603 --> 01:13:15.232
Why'd you a... Ask me that?

01:13:15.566 --> 01:13:17.776
I know about your family.

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:21.238
I looked you up
when you started working here.

01:13:21.989 --> 01:13:24.283
I know someone killed them.

01:13:24.449 --> 01:13:28.954
But you can't give up.
You can't hide here, son.

01:13:30.497 --> 01:13:32.040
I know.

01:13:32.207 --> 01:13:34.626
You don't wanna become like me.

01:13:35.878 --> 01:13:39.798
By the way, your invitation would sound
more real if it had the guy's name on it.

01:13:40.465 --> 01:13:43.051
There's something strange going on
around this building.

01:13:43.218 --> 01:13:45.095
Don't think I haven't noticed.

01:13:52.311 --> 01:13:53.979
It is finished?

01:13:57.107 --> 01:13:59.651
You can see things in the future?

01:13:59.818 --> 01:14:01.820
Some things.

01:14:02.321 --> 01:14:04.781
I have a question to ask you.

01:14:05.616 --> 01:14:08.911
I will do my best to answer it.

01:14:09.077 --> 01:14:11.288
You'll tell me the truth, right?

01:14:12.706 --> 01:14:14.249
Yes.

01:14:15.292 --> 01:14:18.837
Change doesn't happen the way
you say it's gonna happen...

01:14:19.004 --> 01:14:22.633
...without dramatic events
that accelerate thinking.

01:14:23.634 --> 01:14:24.927
I wrote this thing.

01:14:25.093 --> 01:14:28.764
It might take decades or longer
to create a reaction...

01:14:29.223 --> 01:14:32.267
...before it anchors
in the consciousness.

01:14:32.935 --> 01:14:36.605
That's not the type of change
you're telling me is gonna happen, right?

01:14:38.398 --> 01:14:41.401
I was wondering
why he didn't meet me...

01:14:42.528 --> 01:14:45.072
...this leader who's just a boy.

01:14:45.656 --> 01:14:50.202
If he was so inspired by my words,
why didn't he try to meet me?

01:14:51.453 --> 01:14:55.499
There's a lot of things in The Cookbook
people won't like to hear.

01:14:58.001 --> 01:15:03.298
I'm not anything, you know?
I don't think I'm anything special.

01:15:03.465 --> 01:15:06.635
So I started thinking,
"How is this gonna happen?

01:15:06.802 --> 01:15:10.764
Why are people gonna suddenly
take me seriously?

01:15:11.682 --> 01:15:13.976
And why didn't he meet me?"

01:15:17.187 --> 01:15:19.731
And I thought of how it could happen.

01:15:20.190 --> 01:15:25.154
Story, I wanted to ask you,
is something gonna happen to me?

01:15:26.363 --> 01:15:29.741
Is someone gonna kill me
because I write this?

01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:31.869
Yes.

01:15:32.369 --> 01:15:36.039
Man thinks they're each alone
in this world.

01:15:36.206 --> 01:15:38.417
It is not true.

01:15:39.001 --> 01:15:41.336
You are all connected.

01:15:41.879 --> 01:15:45.549
One act can one day affect all.

01:15:50.721 --> 01:15:54.141
What are you guys whispering about?

01:15:54.308 --> 01:15:57.352
Is he trying to get you to tell him
how many kids he's gonna have?

01:15:57.519 --> 01:16:00.606
I told him eight, all bratty boys.

01:16:00.772 --> 01:16:03.901
I asked her if she knew the name
of the deaf, dumb and blind guy...

01:16:04.067 --> 01:16:05.736
...that's gonna marry you.

01:16:05.903 --> 01:16:09.072
Very funny, Herb.

01:16:20.250 --> 01:16:21.752
Okay.

01:16:23.462 --> 01:16:25.839
Don't tell my sister.

01:16:56.954 --> 01:17:00.833
Hi. I'm Mr. Farber.

01:17:02.793 --> 01:17:05.254
I wanted to thank you.

01:17:05.712 --> 01:17:10.759
I was completely surprised by all of this.

01:17:11.218 --> 01:17:15.305
I was expecting some kind of greeting,
of course.

01:17:16.723 --> 01:17:19.726
But this is beyond my expectations.

01:17:22.146 --> 01:17:24.231
I'm 13B.

01:17:25.107 --> 01:17:28.318
- Oh, yeah. How you doing? What's up?
- Oh, yeah. Good for you.

01:17:29.945 --> 01:17:32.948
I know of your future, Cleveland.

01:17:33.448 --> 01:17:35.534
Do you wanna hear it?

01:17:35.701 --> 01:17:37.161
No.

01:17:39.788 --> 01:17:43.500
Tell me what happens
when the eagle takes you back.

01:17:43.917 --> 01:17:47.045
It is only what I have been told
by others.

01:17:47.504 --> 01:17:52.843
They tell us the world will line up
and reveal we are on the right path...

01:17:53.010 --> 01:17:55.387
...that the universe will give us signs.

01:17:56.221 --> 01:17:58.473
The Tartutic could have not come yet.

01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:02.019
I can still sense
the scrunt's presence near.

01:18:02.519 --> 01:18:07.649
You have to believe
that this all makes sense somehow.

01:18:11.028 --> 01:18:13.864
I don't know why I'm the Madam Narf.

01:18:14.031 --> 01:18:19.119
I'm not special. I'm clumsy.
They make fun of me.

01:18:19.286 --> 01:18:21.705
I don't know how to lead.

01:18:23.415 --> 01:18:27.461
Do you get sick
every time you break a rule?

01:18:28.170 --> 01:18:31.507
Every time that you tell me
something that you shouldn't?

01:18:34.676 --> 01:18:37.262
There's a storm coming.

01:18:40.974 --> 01:18:45.062
- I am scared.
- It's okay to be scared.

01:18:45.395 --> 01:18:47.981
I do not have courage.

01:18:48.649 --> 01:18:50.776
I do not want to be a Madam Narf.

01:18:50.943 --> 01:18:53.278
You do what you think is right.

01:18:53.445 --> 01:18:55.906
You are very brave.

01:18:56.782 --> 01:19:00.202
You were always meant to lead, Story.

01:19:03.330 --> 01:19:05.123
Cleveland...

01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:09.169
...the Great Eatlon is coming.

01:20:21.783 --> 01:20:23.202
Okay.

01:20:26.872 --> 01:20:29.166
I'm glad you read my journal.

01:20:30.292 --> 01:20:34.004
Don't worry. We're all watching you.

01:21:08.038 --> 01:21:11.124
Oh, come on.
The music should have started already.

01:21:12.835 --> 01:21:15.462
Do not leave this spot.

01:21:18.131 --> 01:21:20.300
- Yo, come on.
- Hey.

01:21:28.892 --> 01:21:31.103
Find a mirror.

01:22:25.115 --> 01:22:28.327
Why hasn't the m... Music started?

01:22:28.494 --> 01:22:31.955
It's been working smooth.
We've been playing with it all night.

01:22:33.290 --> 01:22:35.584
You used up the battery.

01:22:35.834 --> 01:22:37.628
Wave to him.

01:22:47.262 --> 01:22:49.556
They told her that the universe
would line up...

01:22:49.723 --> 01:22:53.644
...and reveal that we're
on the right p... Path.

01:22:54.019 --> 01:22:56.230
Why isn't this working?

01:23:24.007 --> 01:23:25.592
Okay.

01:23:38.939 --> 01:23:42.359
Sometimes animals just look dead.

01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:51.201
Something went wrong.
They took her inside, up by the pool.

01:24:21.231 --> 01:24:24.193
It is not time for you to go.

01:24:26.487 --> 01:24:31.033
It is not time for you to go.

01:24:38.582 --> 01:24:41.502
Isn't this supposed to work?

01:24:45.923 --> 01:24:49.384
Fourteen across.

01:24:51.428 --> 01:24:53.055
No. No.

01:24:58.060 --> 01:24:59.812
I don't know.

01:25:01.355 --> 01:25:03.148
I don't know.

01:25:06.568 --> 01:25:11.114
This world is about finding
your purpose, right?

01:25:11.281 --> 01:25:15.619
And the only way to do that is to find
your own voice. You told us that.

01:25:16.119 --> 01:25:19.623
I don't feel like an Interpreter.

01:25:20.207 --> 01:25:23.460
Is it possible that that isn't my purpose?

01:25:24.795 --> 01:25:29.091
I mean, I don't see anything
in these words, and I didn't before.

01:25:31.885 --> 01:25:34.471
And finding one's purpose
is a profound thing.

01:25:34.638 --> 01:25:37.641
Sometimes it isn't always
what it seems.

01:25:41.145 --> 01:25:43.105
What if these young men
are not the Guild?

01:25:43.272 --> 01:25:44.857
Look at what happened at the party.

01:25:45.023 --> 01:25:47.442
These things haven't seemed right
from the beginning.

01:25:47.609 --> 01:25:51.238
Why are you so certain that I am
the Interpreter and they are the Guild?

01:25:55.951 --> 01:25:58.495
He was so sure.

01:25:58.662 --> 01:26:00.080
What?

01:26:00.539 --> 01:26:02.207
I...

01:26:03.584 --> 01:26:05.878
...asked someone.

01:26:06.044 --> 01:26:08.297
He acted like he knew.

01:26:08.463 --> 01:26:10.424
What kind of person
would be so arrogant...

01:26:10.591 --> 01:26:13.343
...to presume to know the intention
of another human being?

01:26:13.510 --> 01:26:15.596
Who put this young girl's life
in jeopardy?

01:26:22.728 --> 01:26:24.480
Hello?

01:26:31.862 --> 01:26:35.199
Is the bathroom on this level working?

01:26:37.534 --> 01:26:39.828
A dog inside the building.

01:26:39.995 --> 01:26:42.956
Go. Shoo!

01:26:48.295 --> 01:26:50.047
Why, you're not a dog at all.

01:26:53.759 --> 01:26:55.427
My God.

01:26:56.053 --> 01:26:59.139
This is like a moment
from a horror movie.

01:27:00.891 --> 01:27:04.102
It is precisely the moment
where the mutation or beast...

01:27:04.269 --> 01:27:07.940
...will attempt to kill
an unlikable side character.

01:27:08.106 --> 01:27:12.277
But in stories where there
has been no prior cursing, nudity...

01:27:12.444 --> 01:27:15.656
...killing or death,
such as in a family film...

01:27:15.823 --> 01:27:19.743
...the unlikable character
will narrowly escape his encounter...

01:27:19.910 --> 01:27:22.287
...and be referenced again
later in the story...

01:27:22.454 --> 01:27:25.624
...having learned valuable lessons.

01:27:26.208 --> 01:27:28.085
He may even be given
a humorous moment...

01:27:28.252 --> 01:27:31.296
...to allow the audience
to feel good about him.

01:27:33.465 --> 01:27:36.510
This is where I turn to run.

01:27:36.677 --> 01:27:39.096
You will leap for me.

01:27:39.263 --> 01:27:41.265
I will shut the door.

01:27:41.431 --> 01:27:45.936
And you will land
a fraction of a second too late.

01:27:49.189 --> 01:27:51.024
Why would they lie to her
about Tartutic?

01:27:51.191 --> 01:27:54.695
These cannot just be fairy tales
they tell to make the narfs risk their lives.

01:27:54.862 --> 01:27:56.321
This has gotta be about faith.

01:27:56.488 --> 01:27:59.533
Her world works by different rules
than ours. She may not be dead.

01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:02.661
- We need to be told what to do.
- We need to find the Interpreter.

01:28:02.828 --> 01:28:05.372
How are we suddenly
going to realize someone's purpose?

01:28:05.539 --> 01:28:08.959
This is someone doing something ancient.
An ancient thing in modern times.

01:28:09.126 --> 01:28:11.962
It could be someone who sees purity
in what we see as mundane.

01:28:12.129 --> 01:28:14.131
Sees the voice of God
in the ordinary.

01:28:14.298 --> 01:28:16.466
He is someone who sees meaning
in the ordinary.

01:28:16.633 --> 01:28:20.137
Does anyone have any idea
who this is?

01:28:22.306 --> 01:28:23.849
My God.

01:28:25.976 --> 01:28:27.436
I do.

01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:30.731
There is a message.

01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:35.819
There is a ceremony to be done.

01:28:35.986 --> 01:28:38.280
You're doing great, Joey.

01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:44.745
The hands of the Guild will be needed,
plus two others.

01:28:44.912 --> 01:28:47.748
Joey, who is the Guild?

01:28:50.125 --> 01:28:53.504
It is a ceremony of seven sisters.

01:28:53.670 --> 01:28:56.215
Sisters? The Guild is women?

01:28:57.508 --> 01:29:00.511
They will touch together
with their hearts as one...

01:29:00.677 --> 01:29:03.138
...to bring strength to the moment.

01:29:03.305 --> 01:29:05.140
Nice, Joey.

01:29:07.684 --> 01:29:10.521
You will need a man
who has no secrets...

01:29:10.687 --> 01:29:14.483
...and one whose opinion
is highly respected as witnesses.

01:29:15.901 --> 01:29:20.697
All must hurry.
This will all be over in moments.

01:29:50.352 --> 01:29:52.855
Mr. Perez de la Torre.

01:29:53.522 --> 01:29:58.902
I need to speak with your
f... F... F... F... Five daughters.

01:30:03.490 --> 01:30:07.578
Honey? Honey,
there's some people here to see you.

01:30:14.626 --> 01:30:16.128
Sweetheart?

01:30:17.754 --> 01:30:20.174
He's probably rinsing his mouth.

01:30:20.340 --> 01:30:22.259
He's got terrible breath.

01:30:22.426 --> 01:30:24.970
Don't tell him I told you.

01:30:39.359 --> 01:30:43.322
- Huge explosions
right in the very heart of the capital.

01:30:43.489 --> 01:30:48.744
Several explosions, I felt at least four
very close to the center of the city.

01:31:56.270 --> 01:31:58.814
I think we have everybody.

01:32:01.692 --> 01:32:05.737
A man who has no secrets...

01:32:05.904 --> 01:32:11.368
...and one whose opinion
I greatly respect.

01:32:11.535 --> 01:32:15.706
They will be w... W... Witnesses.

01:32:15.873 --> 01:32:20.252
Will the Guild please come forward?

01:32:24.882 --> 01:32:26.466
Yeah.

01:32:27.676 --> 01:32:29.678
And you make seven.

01:32:30.387 --> 01:32:32.389
Seven sisters.

01:32:34.892 --> 01:32:36.810
Come, come.

01:32:39.146 --> 01:32:40.647
Yeah.

01:32:41.398 --> 01:32:43.692
Everything's right now.

01:32:48.447 --> 01:32:50.699
Come back to us now.

01:32:51.825 --> 01:32:55.996
Come back to us now, honey.
Come back to us.

01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:04.129
I can't believe it.

01:33:04.296 --> 01:33:08.133
This is crazy. This woman
is probably dying as we're talking.

01:33:08.300 --> 01:33:09.927
She needs to get to a hospital.

01:33:10.093 --> 01:33:14.306
This is not right. We can't just stand here
playing make-believe.

01:33:14.473 --> 01:33:17.267
I wanted to believe more than most.

01:33:17.851 --> 01:33:20.270
I wanna be like a child again.

01:33:20.771 --> 01:33:23.774
I needed to believe there's more
than this awfulness around us...

01:33:23.941 --> 01:33:25.651
...but at some point we have to stop.

01:33:25.818 --> 01:33:30.989
Mr. Leeds, it is time to prove
some stories are real.

01:33:32.074 --> 01:33:34.117
I read it wrong.

01:33:39.039 --> 01:33:40.791
It was my first time.

01:33:40.958 --> 01:33:43.961
I thought it said, "She will lead
a ceremony of seven sisters...

01:33:44.127 --> 01:33:46.463
...to bring strength to the moment."

01:33:47.130 --> 01:33:50.843
I looked at it again. It says "he."

01:33:51.009 --> 01:33:56.807
"He will lead a ceremony of seven sisters
to bring strength to the moment."

01:33:56.974 --> 01:34:00.269
Mrs. Bell is not the Healer.

01:34:00.435 --> 01:34:02.646
It said the Healer could be a man.

01:34:02.813 --> 01:34:05.357
But l... But l...
I saw a butterfly land right on her.

01:34:05.524 --> 01:34:06.650
Butterflies?

01:34:06.817 --> 01:34:10.279
Yeah, the bedtime story
said butterflies are drawn to the Healer.

01:34:10.445 --> 01:34:12.906
But, Mr. Heep,
you brought that butterfly to me.

01:34:13.073 --> 01:34:16.535
It caught my eye as you walked over.

01:34:18.996 --> 01:34:20.414
I did?

01:34:27.087 --> 01:34:28.922
Wait, no.

01:34:29.089 --> 01:34:30.883
You must try.

01:34:31.049 --> 01:34:34.261
- There's no time.
- I can't. I can't. I can't.

01:34:34.428 --> 01:34:36.013
Shut up...

01:34:37.014 --> 01:34:38.557
...and try.

01:35:19.723 --> 01:35:22.976
Say something to bring out your energy.

01:35:26.980 --> 01:35:29.983
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.

01:35:35.948 --> 01:35:37.783
I should have been there.

01:35:37.950 --> 01:35:40.285
I am always gonna regret...

01:35:42.412 --> 01:35:44.915
...just not being there.

01:35:50.587 --> 01:35:53.090
I'll miss your faces.

01:35:55.926 --> 01:35:58.595
Oh, they remind me of God.

01:36:04.768 --> 01:36:07.688
I'm so lost without you guys.

01:36:13.277 --> 01:36:18.824
I met this very nice lady,
and her name's Story.

01:36:20.159 --> 01:36:22.578
And I think you would've liked her.

01:36:25.455 --> 01:36:27.666
I think she might be...

01:36:29.418 --> 01:36:31.420
...an angel...

01:36:33.630 --> 01:36:36.300
...because she has to go home.

01:36:41.180 --> 01:36:43.348
I love you all.

01:36:44.892 --> 01:36:47.561
I love you all so much.

01:37:33.357 --> 01:37:36.485
Thank you for all you have done.

01:37:47.955 --> 01:37:51.291
Your sister will have seven children.

01:37:51.458 --> 01:37:53.669
You will see the first two.

01:40:09.179 --> 01:40:13.058
Oh, my God. He's the Guardian.

01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:14.852
Reggie!

01:40:15.018 --> 01:40:17.312
Reggie! Reggie,
just keep looking in his eyes!

01:40:17.479 --> 01:40:19.898
Keep looking in his eyes!

01:42:06.088 --> 01:42:08.799
Thank you for saving my life.
