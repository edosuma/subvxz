IT'S PERSONAL,
SO STAY OUT OF IT.

13:11.225 --> 13:12.661
THE NEXT TIME YOU
GET IN MY WAY,

13:12.704 --> 13:14.881
I'M PUTTING AN ARROW
THROUGH YOU.

13:26.066 --> 13:27.850
NO HITS ON THE STATE
BIRTH INDEX,

13:27.894 --> 13:29.199
NO HOSPITAL RECORDS.

13:29.243 --> 13:30.940
AS FAR AS THE GOVERNMENT
IS CONCERNED,

13:30.984 --> 13:33.073
YOUR MYSTERY SISTER
DOESN'T EVEN EXIST.

13:33.116 --> 13:35.031
WELL, MY FATHER WAS
ALWAYS VERY GOOD AT

13:35.075 --> 13:36.859
BURYING HIS SECRETS.

13:36.903 --> 13:39.209
YEAH.

13:41.211 --> 13:42.430
HEY, YOU OK?

13:44.040 --> 13:45.868
YOU KNOW, THIS HAS
TO BE A SHOCK,

13:45.912 --> 13:47.478
NOT AS BIG AS
A SHOCK AS MAYBE

13:47.522 --> 13:50.090
BECOMING THE FLASH
AND THEN FIGHTING
ALONGSIDE BATWOMAN,

13:50.133 --> 13:52.440
BUT STILL A SHOCK.

13:52.483 --> 13:55.095
I HAVE COME TO TERMS
WITH THE FACT THAT

13:55.138 --> 13:57.532
MY FATHER KEPT THINGS
FROM US.

13:59.099 --> 14:01.579
HEY, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
REACH OUT TO HER.

14:01.623 --> 14:03.233
I FEEL LIKE IF SHE
WANTED TO TALK TO ME,

14:03.277 --> 14:05.018
SHE WOULD'VE COME
AND TALKED TO ME.

14:05.061 --> 14:06.628

RUNNING AROUND TOWN
DRESSED LIKE YOU.

14:06.671 --> 14:08.369
I MEAN,
I'M NO THERAPIST,
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE

14:08.412 --> 14:09.849
THE TECHNICAL TERM
FOR THAT IS
CRY FOR HELP.

14:09.892 --> 14:11.459
SHE HAS TO HAVE A REASON.

14:11.502 --> 14:12.852
YEAH.

14:12.895 --> 14:16.551
I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE
JUST BARGING INTO HER LIFE,

NOT WITHOUT KNOWING MORE.

14:18.770 --> 14:21.034

A GENIUS.

SO ONE THING WE
KNOW ABOUT YOUR FATHER
IS THAT HE LOVED

14:30.782 --> 14:32.436
A GOOD OLD-FASHIONED
PAPER TRAIL.

14:32.480 --> 14:35.091
HE USED AN OFFSHORE
ACCOUNT TO HANDLE

14:35.135 --> 14:38.486
SOME OF HIS MORE SENSITIVE
FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS.

ACTIVE.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.711

GONNA BE THE ONE

15:47.207 --> 15:50.123
LET ME MAKE ONE THING
CLEAR, RICARDO.

15:50.166 --> 15:53.039

WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW.

MY APOLOGIES FOR NOT
LOOPING YOU IN SOONER, SIR.

OF REINSTATING
THE GHOST INITIATIVE.
