WEBVTT

00:33.466 --> 00:36.466
His name is Achmed al-Paula Abdul
al-Paul Anka al-Casey Kasem bin Shakira.

00:39.439 --> 00:41.640
We must find out who he works for.

00:41.641 --> 00:44.641
Leave it to me, sir. I,ll crack him faster
than Condoleezza Rice...

00:45.245 --> 00:48.245
cracked the glass ceiling
with her beautiful straightened hair.

00:51.284 --> 00:53.619
It's no use, C.I.A. man.

00:53.620 --> 00:55.721
I will never talk. Never!

00:55.722 --> 00:57.956
Shh.

00:57.957 --> 01:00.957
Every man has a weakness. What is his?

01:01.594 --> 01:04.495
His teeth are yellow,
so he's a smoker.

01:04.497 --> 01:07.497
The handcuffs around his wrists
mean he's in some sort of trouble.

01:07.801 --> 01:10.402
The haunted look in his eyes
suggest that he doesn't know...

01:10.403 --> 01:13.272
what Eric McCormack's gonna
do after Will And Grace either.

01:13.273 --> 01:16.273
He's got a wedding ring,
but his shirt doesn't match his pants...

01:17.010 --> 01:20.010
which means his wife
has stop caring. Gotcha!

01:20.513 --> 01:23.513
Oh, man!
Another spot on my tie.

01:23.850 --> 01:26.185
It's like my wife
doesn't even care anymore.

01:26.186 --> 01:29.186
I,m sorry. You shouldn't have to listen to
my complaints. It's not like you could relate.

01:30.223 --> 01:33.223
Actually, you might be surprised.

01:33.293 --> 01:36.293
My wife and I haven't been getting along
for quite some time now.

01:36.496 --> 01:39.496
It's like she's no longer
the woman I traded goats for, you know?

01:40.400 --> 01:43.400
Preaching to the mosque, Achmed.
Preaching to the mosque.

01:43.903 --> 01:46.438
Dude, it's okay.
She,ll come around.

01:46.439 --> 01:48.807
It just sucks, you know?

01:48.808 --> 01:51.808
It's like she's jealous of my work as
chief bomb maker at Arabs for Chaos.

01:53.546 --> 01:56.546
Ooh. Probably shouldn't have told you that.

01:56.549 --> 01:58.550
I thought we were friends!

01:58.551 --> 02:00.819
You thought what I made you think.

02:00.820 --> 02:03.021
I still want to
get the wives together.

02:03.022 --> 02:06.022
Well done, Smith.
I,m going to pat you on the bottom.

02:06.292 --> 02:09.292
Ready?
There it is.

02:11.664 --> 02:14.664
Look. it's Jenny Bowen.
She's got the body of Lara Croft...

02:15.268 --> 02:18.268
the pouty good looks
of Resident Evil's Jill valentine...

02:18.438 --> 02:21.438
and the frank eroticism
of Rosie O,Donnell.

02:21.508 --> 02:24.508
God, I,d love to bend Rosie O,Donnell
over a buffet table...

02:25.411 --> 02:28.013
and just let her eat
all she wants.

02:28.014 --> 02:31.014
Yes, Rosie O,Donnell
is every teenage boy's Mrs. Right.

02:31.117 --> 02:33.886
But these girls are Mrs. Right Here.

02:33.887 --> 02:36.155
Those girls will never talk to us.

02:36.156 --> 02:39.156
They,ll give us boo-boos
on our feelings.

02:39.526 --> 02:42.294
- Trust me, guys. We can do this.
- But what if they-

02:42.295 --> 02:44.696
No ifs, no buts, no coconuts.

02:47.567 --> 02:50.567
- Afternoon, ladies.
- What do you little kids want?

02:51.371 --> 02:54.371
Little kids? Would a little kid have a $50
watch he bought with good-boy points?

02:56.442 --> 02:59.411
Sorry. We only date guys with cars.

03:03.449 --> 03:06.449
Ohh!

03:07.253 --> 03:09.154
I,m home.

03:09.155 --> 03:11.690
Oh, if I had known you were
gonna be home so early...

03:11.691 --> 03:14.193
I wouldn't have taken
care of myself in the bathtub.

03:14.194 --> 03:17.194
Hey, you know how we were
talking about getting me a new car?

03:17.497 --> 03:19.531
Well, I know exactly what I want.

03:19.532 --> 03:22.234
The Fem wagon.
It's a little pricey.

03:22.235 --> 03:25.235
Hey, you,ve got one of the C.I.A.'s
top negotiators on your side.

03:26.139 --> 03:28.607
You know I negotiated my way
through negotiator training.

03:28.608 --> 03:31.608
I should have failed the hell out
of that class. That's how good I am.

03:36.482 --> 03:39.482
- Hi, I,m Felix. Can I help you?
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

03:39.919 --> 03:42.919
Every man has a weakness. What is his?

03:43.756 --> 03:46.325
- I notice you shave against the grain.
- What?

03:46.326 --> 03:48.627
I do the same thing.

03:48.628 --> 03:51.628
My dad wasn't around
to teach me any different.

03:52.932 --> 03:55.932
Neither was mine.

03:56.002 --> 03:58.704
So, what do you think of your new car?
Do you love it?

03:58.705 --> 04:01.705
I told you I wanted the Fem wagon.
This is the Phallus.

04:02.242 --> 04:05.242
No, it's the Phallus E.S.
Felix said it was the last one on the lot.

04:05.845 --> 04:08.845
I had to act fast or this other guy
was totally gonna buy it.

04:09.482 --> 04:11.483
Son of a bitch!
He mind-raped me!

04:11.484 --> 04:14.484
Don't worry, honey.
No car salesman is gonna get the better of me.

04:18.524 --> 04:21.524
- Is she a beauty or what?
- Stan, that's my old car.

04:22.028 --> 04:24.997
Correction. It's your
new pre-owned car...

04:24.998 --> 04:27.132
and I got it
for a sweet 10 grand.

04:27.133 --> 04:29.301
We sold it to him for 7,000.

04:29.302 --> 04:31.903
Yeah, but he let me keep the Phallus
for no extra charge.

04:31.904 --> 04:34.573
Because you already paid for it!

04:34.574 --> 04:37.342
Francine, there's a lot of math-
man math-

04:37.343 --> 04:40.343
involved in a car purchase
that- Damn it!

04:49.188 --> 04:52.188
Why... does... this...
keep... happening?

04:53.693 --> 04:55.694
Sorry about this mess, Klaus.

04:55.695 --> 04:58.695
They cleared out the garage
to make room for Stan's stupid cars.

04:58.931 --> 05:01.931
The one time I invite
the fish up here for drinks.

05:02.035 --> 05:05.035
Oh, don't worry about it.
I,m... having fun. I,m having fun.

05:07.340 --> 05:10.042
Oh, my God!
A movie projector!

05:10.043 --> 05:13.043
Is there anything more magical
than movies?

05:13.579 --> 05:15.747
Wait! There's no movies!

05:15.748 --> 05:18.748
It's like having the world's biggest
wine cooler and no girls from New Jersey.

05:21.220 --> 05:23.622
Hey, what are you doing
with my dad's movie projector?

05:23.623 --> 05:26.623
If I,m living in a storage unit so he can buy
20 cars, I,m gonna get something out of it.

05:28.094 --> 05:31.094
Get something out of it?
Cars?

05:31.864 --> 05:34.864
Yes! The girls would go crazy
over these cars! That's it!

05:36.235 --> 05:38.236
Hey, Algernon,
what's wrong with you?

05:38.237 --> 05:41.237
Can't you get an idea
without saying it out loud?

05:43.276 --> 05:46.276
Smith, I told you to interrogate
that prisoner an hour ago.

05:47.347 --> 05:50.347
Uh, lost my confidence because
a car salesman bested me eight times?

05:50.783 --> 05:53.783
Of course I haven't lost my confidence
because a car salesman bested me eight times.

05:54.354 --> 05:57.354
Good! Then get in there.

05:58.324 --> 06:01.324
Okay, so here's a passport, $1,000
and the names of all our operatives.

06:02.295 --> 06:05.295
Great. And you should be receiving your
first issue of Essence in six to eight weeks.

06:06.499 --> 06:09.499
- Awesome!
- Smith! What in God's name are you doing?

06:10.503 --> 06:13.503
Feets, don't explode
on me now!

06:17.310 --> 06:20.310
- You gave away state secrets to a terrorist?
- Freedom fighter?

06:21.848 --> 06:24.848
Smith, until you get your head in the game,
I,m suspending you without pay.

06:26.786 --> 06:29.786
Clean out your desk
and leave immediately!

06:31.023 --> 06:33.125
Janet, when's my next appointment?

06:33.126 --> 06:35.560
- Not for two hours, sir.
- Excellent.

06:56.482 --> 06:59.482
- Later, buddy.
- See you, pal.

07:00.620 --> 07:02.754
Ah, the joys of work.

07:02.755 --> 07:05.755
These car payment bills are
really starting to pile up, Stan.

07:06.159 --> 07:09.159
I,m know. Because I,m an idiot.
My sensei would be disgusted.

07:09.929 --> 07:12.929
He spent 16 months training me
in the art of mental manipulation...

07:13.399 --> 07:16.399
and then some car salesman
makes my brain his bitch!

07:16.436 --> 07:19.436
Well, maybe you should go visit your sensei.
You know, get a tune-up.

07:30.716 --> 07:32.784
Stan, you return.

07:32.785 --> 07:35.785
- Yes, Sensei. I,ve come back to you for guidance.
- Enter, young one.

07:36.989 --> 07:39.989
I,m right in the middle of trying
to get the toaster to pop...

07:40.092 --> 07:43.092
and I,m afraid to put
anything metal in there.

07:45.498 --> 07:48.498
Well, ladies, start your engines!

07:48.668 --> 07:51.570
Wow! You actually do have cars.

07:51.571 --> 07:53.905
I want to brush your hair.

07:53.906 --> 07:56.074
Hey, we should go to the beach.

07:56.075 --> 07:59.075
Yeah. Um, we don't exactly
know how to drive these cars.

08:02.715 --> 08:05.715
- Are you kidding me?
- No. No. No, I,m not. But we can sit in them.

08:07.086 --> 08:10.086
On a clear night, this one gets Radio Disney.
Why did I say that?

08:13.125 --> 08:15.160
Roger, this package came for you.

08:15.161 --> 08:18.161
My films! Oh, gimme, gimme, gimme!

08:18.698 --> 08:21.698
Ah, "chinema....

08:22.268 --> 08:25.268
Porky's?Meatballs II?
Enjoy your crapfest.

08:27.173 --> 08:30.173
Oh, go read The Bell Jar, you poser!

08:31.544 --> 08:34.111
Klaus, prepare to feast your eyes...

08:34.113 --> 08:37.113
on the majestic grandeur
of the silver screen.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.154
Wah-wahhh!

08:43.155 --> 08:46.057
Damn it!

08:49.862 --> 08:52.831
You guys have your own drive-in?

08:52.832 --> 08:55.832
Yes. Yes. Yes, we do.

08:56.202 --> 09:01.273
Turkey pot pie
or chicken pot pie?

09:01.274 --> 09:03.742
Turkey pot pie-

09:03.743 --> 09:06.743
Perhaps the answer is not what is inside the pie...

09:07.613 --> 09:09.614
but what is inside you.

09:09.615 --> 09:11.716
Stan, you scared me half to death.

09:11.717 --> 09:13.818
Better to be scared half to death...

09:13.819 --> 09:16.819
than to death half... scared... be... to.

09:17.990 --> 09:20.158
Oh. Okay.

09:20.159 --> 09:23.159
Well, we,re glad to have you home,
especially with the bills piling up.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.563
The bills will be dealt with.
But now I rest.

09:26.566 --> 09:29.566
At dawn, I go down to the dealership,
wait four hours until they open...

09:30.903 --> 09:33.903
and then kick the mental ass
of a certain car salesman.

09:34.707 --> 09:37.707
He will take back these cars,
and I will take back my pride.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.845
- Farewell, my concubine.
- What?

09:43.583 --> 09:46.583
We accept the fact
that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday...

09:46.953 --> 09:49.754
in detention for whatever
it was we did wrong.

09:49.755 --> 09:52.755
But we think you're crazytomake us write
an essaytellingyou who we think weare.

09:53.693 --> 09:56.227
You see us as you want to see us-

09:56.228 --> 09:59.228
in the simplest terms,
the most convenient definitions.

10:00.166 --> 10:03.166
But what we found out
is that each one ofus is a brain...

10:04.470 --> 10:07.470
and an athlete
and a basket case...

10:08.240 --> 10:11.240
a princess
and a criminal.

10:11.310 --> 10:14.310
Does that answer
your question?

10:14.347 --> 10:17.347
Sincerely yours,
the Breakfast Club.

10:20.019 --> 10:23.019
Thanks, guys. But we were just wondering,
why didn't you try anything?

10:24.357 --> 10:26.358
We-We could have tried something?

10:26.359 --> 10:29.359
That's what drive-ins are for.
Getting down and dirty.

10:29.929 --> 10:32.929
Oh. Okay, baby.
Well, let's get busy.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.834
The movie's over,
you little pervert.

10:35.835 --> 10:38.737
But we,d love to do this again,
say, next weekend?

10:38.738 --> 10:41.738
- Weekends are when I clean out my belly button.
- Eww!

10:42.308 --> 10:45.308
My boy is wicked hygienic.

10:53.052 --> 10:56.052
Chicken pot pie! My favorite!

10:56.288 --> 10:58.423
- Actually, it's turkey.
- Oh, gross!

10:58.424 --> 11:00.525
Why don't we just eat
a big pile of vomit?

11:00.526 --> 11:03.526
Giant bumblebees! They,ve come at last!

11:05.064 --> 11:08.064
What the hell is that?

11:12.538 --> 11:14.773
You bought a blimp?

11:14.774 --> 11:17.774
Francine, with today's low helium prices,
we,d be crazy not to buy.

11:19.812 --> 11:22.447
Oh, my God!
He did it to me again!

11:22.448 --> 11:24.816
- Now, Stan-
- Don't look at me!

11:24.817 --> 11:27.817
I,m not worthy to be
the head of this family. I,m leaving.

11:28.254 --> 11:31.254
I,m going someplace where
I won't bring shame to this house!

11:31.657 --> 11:33.725
Stan, please, you,re not-

11:36.562 --> 11:39.562
Damn! I can't even exit
mysteriously anymore.

11:44.770 --> 11:47.605
- When's Dad coming back?
- Don't know.

11:47.606 --> 11:50.606
Don't, uh- Don't know.

11:52.878 --> 11:55.413
Oh, my God!
We,re a broken home!

11:55.414 --> 11:58.414
And I,m too drunk and they,re too dumb
to channel it into art.

11:59.285 --> 12:01.286
Everything's gonna be fine.

12:01.287 --> 12:04.287
Once he finds his confidence,
he,ll be right back here.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.725
But what are we
gonna do for money?

12:08.861 --> 12:11.861
- We,re here to clean the house.
- Buenos dias.

12:12.031 --> 12:15.031
I am Judy.

12:15.568 --> 12:18.568
La toilet. La toilet!
No espoo-poo.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.906
Are you saying you would
like me to clean the toilet?

12:21.907 --> 12:24.907
No!No!
No espoo-poo!

12:25.745 --> 12:28.745
- Dad better come home soon.
- Hang in there, sweetheart.

12:29.281 --> 12:31.783
Did you break my coffeemaker?

12:31.784 --> 12:33.852
I don't know what
you,re talking about.

12:33.853 --> 12:35.854
Coffee... maker!

12:35.855 --> 12:38.855
Elburroporlos coffee.

12:39.258 --> 12:42.258
I know what a coffee maker is.
We weren't even in the kitchen.

12:42.728 --> 12:45.728
- No dinero today.
- But we worked for 12 hours!

12:46.098 --> 12:49.098
You want me to call I.N.S.?
You comprende that? Yeah, you do.

12:56.809 --> 12:59.144
Stan?

12:59.145 --> 13:02.145
Just a minute!

13:02.515 --> 13:05.183
Francine, what a nice surprise!

13:05.184 --> 13:07.185
What brings you
to the neighborhood?

13:07.186 --> 13:09.954
Can I offer you something to drink?
Half a can of Tab? Rain water?

13:09.955 --> 13:12.955
Stan, you have to come home.
We,re totally broke.

13:13.192 --> 13:16.192
The kids need a father,
and I have this jar I can't open.

13:16.729 --> 13:19.729
And quit now? No, I,ve got
some really exciting things happening.

13:20.166 --> 13:23.166
A whole new entrepreneurial thing that is
gonna be the next big thing for Stan Smith.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.805
Check it out.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.174
- What are you selling?
- Still working on that.

13:29.175 --> 13:32.175
But once I nail it,
it's gonna take off like a rocket.

13:32.711 --> 13:35.346
I,ll give you $5.00 for all of them.

13:35.347 --> 13:38.347
Go to hell!

13:52.865 --> 13:55.865
I killed my best friend.
And for what?

13:57.603 --> 14:00.603
A turd made of solid gold.

14:04.176 --> 14:06.177
What have I done?

14:06.178 --> 14:09.178
What have I done?

14:10.015 --> 14:13.015
This is all your fault.

14:28.300 --> 14:30.301
Why do you think
he did it, sir?

14:30.302 --> 14:33.302
Who knows? Probably running
from something. Himself, most likely.

14:39.144 --> 14:41.579
What the hell? Gold.

14:41.580 --> 14:43.581
Find something, Lieutenant?

14:43.582 --> 14:46.582
Ha. Just an old nickel, Chris.

14:47.086 --> 14:50.086
Just an old nickel.

14:50.689 --> 14:53.689
It's.. beautiful
What do you think it is?

14:54.226 --> 14:56.261
It's a mistake is what it is.

14:56.262 --> 14:59.262
One week to retirement,
I risk my pension by stealing evidence?

15:00.065 --> 15:02.066
What the hell was I thinking?

15:02.067 --> 15:05.067
You were thinking about us.
Oh, Eddie, don'tyou see?

15:06.338 --> 15:09.338
The best your pension will buy us is some
crappy little cracker box on the eastern shore.

15:12.311 --> 15:15.311
But now-
now we can go to Boca.

15:16.382 --> 15:19.382
- This changes everything.
- This changes nothing!

15:19.885 --> 15:22.885
I,ve always been a good cop,
and I,m going out a good cop.

15:24.690 --> 15:27.690
- You,re going out a nothing!
- An honest nothing!

15:27.860 --> 15:30.695
Yeah, well,
I,m sick of your honesty!

15:30.696 --> 15:33.398
What about me? Huh?

15:33.399 --> 15:35.600
What about all those
late nights I lied awake...

15:35.601 --> 15:37.602
wondering if you
were in some gutter...

15:37.603 --> 15:40.603
plugged in the groceries
by some hopped-up dope fiend?

15:40.606 --> 15:43.606
- Don't I get something for that?
- Listen to yourself, Marilyn.

15:44.276 --> 15:46.878
This isn't you.
This isn't us.

15:46.879 --> 15:49.080
It's this... thing.

15:49.081 --> 15:52.081
It's- It's putting
bad thoughts in our heads.

15:53.052 --> 15:56.052
No. Tomorrow, I,m just gonna
turn it in and face the music.

15:57.523 --> 16:00.523
Oh, you,re right.
You,re right.

16:01.060 --> 16:03.494
I,m sorry, Eddie.

16:03.495 --> 16:06.495
I,ll get us some tea.
It,ll calm us down.

16:07.199 --> 16:09.801
The sooner
it's out ofour lives the better.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.802
Besides, that cracker box won't seem so bad
when our grandkids come to visit.

16:14.840 --> 16:17.840
Yeah. I hear Boca's
really humid anyways.

16:21.413 --> 16:24.413
Besides, Eddie,
you,re all I need.

16:32.958 --> 16:35.059
Welcome back to
the drive-in, ladies.

16:35.060 --> 16:37.228
Your chariots to pleasure await.

16:43.202 --> 16:46.202
Ah, Steve, your first grope fest.

16:46.372 --> 16:49.040
You won't truly appreciate
the awkwardness of this moment...

16:49.041 --> 16:52.041
until you,re fondly reminiscing
as a 35-year-old homosexual.

17:02.654 --> 17:04.722
Here to repo the cars.

17:04.723 --> 17:07.025
You can't do that.
We,re about to become men.

17:07.026 --> 17:10.026
Well, you may have planned on
becoming men through sexual conquest...

17:10.462 --> 17:13.462
but perhaps an equally valid
preparation for adulthood...

17:13.632 --> 17:16.632
would be a night filled
with disappointment and compromise.

17:20.472 --> 17:22.707
Ohh!

17:22.708 --> 17:25.708
Ah, the death of the drive-in. Harbinger
of the slow demise of American cinema.

17:28.113 --> 17:31.113
The grand images, the big stars.
Where did they go?

17:31.650 --> 17:34.650
Now everyone just sits at home.
Now it's all TV, TV, TV!

17:36.789 --> 17:38.790
Wait a second!
I have a TV!

17:38.791 --> 17:41.791
How could I forget you,
my good-time gal?

17:42.061 --> 17:44.062
Who needs the damn movies?

17:44.063 --> 17:47.063
Fifteen bucks to see who's chasing Ashley Judd
through the woods? Movies are dead.

17:48.700 --> 17:51.700
Long live TV!

17:52.771 --> 17:55.473
What's for breakfast?

17:55.474 --> 17:58.474
All we have left
is this one Cheerio.

17:58.510 --> 18:01.510
But if you hold it up to your eye,
it looks like you,re having a bagel.

18:02.214 --> 18:05.214
- Grocery money!
- How,d you get grocery money?

18:09.855 --> 18:12.855
- Wait! Who's he?
- Steve, stop bothering your sister. Hayley, you did good.

18:17.096 --> 18:20.096
- Why,d we have to walk here?
- Because we,re poor as hell!

18:20.866 --> 18:23.234
Stan? What are you doing here?

18:23.235 --> 18:26.235
I,m selling candy to raise money so my soccer
team can get new uniforms. Will you help us?

18:27.673 --> 18:30.141
- No!
- I don't blame you. It's a total scam.

18:30.142 --> 18:33.142
- Stan, it's time to come home.
- No! I don't deserve it!

18:36.348 --> 18:38.349
You!

18:38.350 --> 18:40.751
- You smell like potty.
- You smell like potty!

18:40.752 --> 18:42.954
- Let's get inside.
- You did this to me!

18:42.955 --> 18:45.955
I had everything! A family! A great job!
You took it all from me.

18:47.526 --> 18:50.461
- Is that true?
- Oh, I,m sure it's not that bad.

18:50.462 --> 18:53.462
- Our lives are ruined.
- I,ve... done things.

18:54.032 --> 18:56.534
And it all started
with that damn car!

18:56.535 --> 18:59.535
- Daddy, I thought you sold people
cars to help them. - I do. I-

19:02.074 --> 19:04.675
Look, why don't we go back
to my office, call the bank...

19:04.676 --> 19:06.677
and get you off the hook
for your loans?

19:06.678 --> 19:09.547
- Oh, thank you.
- No! No charity!

19:09.548 --> 19:12.548
- Stan!
- Any car we need, I will pay for with candy.

19:12.651 --> 19:15.651
Stan, your family's in bad shape here.
Let me help you.

19:16.088 --> 19:19.088
I,ll set you up with that Fem wagon.
I,ll even knock off 10 bucks a month.

19:24.596 --> 19:27.596
Initial, initial and signature.

19:27.699 --> 19:30.699
And vengeance is mine.
In your face!

19:32.204 --> 19:35.204
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yes! Me!

19:36.341 --> 19:38.109
Um, what?

19:38.110 --> 19:41.110
That's right, car salesman.
How does it feel to have fallen into my trap?

19:41.747 --> 19:43.781
My plan worked perfectly.

19:43.782 --> 19:46.782
- Plan? What plan? - Why, my
pretending-to-be- depressed-and-go-crazy plan.

19:48.420 --> 19:51.420
Pretending? You put us
through all this on purpose?

19:52.524 --> 19:54.525
Let me walk you through.

19:54.526 --> 19:57.526
I went to Nepal to see my
sensei, but it turned out to be a bad weekend

19:58.664 --> 20:01.664
So he couldn't give me the mind control
techniques I so desperately needed

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
As you can imagine,
it was a depressing plane ride home...

20:05.771 --> 20:08.771
until l realized I was sitting next
to the foulmouthed playwright...

20:09.107 --> 20:11.442
and master of the con game,
David Mamet.

20:11.443 --> 20:14.443
We decided that the whole going crazy shtick
was the best way to handle Felix.

20:15.147 --> 20:18.147
We knew that if l bought a blimp and then
abandoned my impoverished family...

20:18.617 --> 20:21.617
you and the kids would be forced
to shop at the off-brand grocery store...

20:23.088 --> 20:26.088
where I knew Felix must shop because
he's so obsessed with the best deal

20:26.225 --> 20:29.225
Therefore, it was only a matter of time
before we would all meet...

20:29.628 --> 20:32.628
I would humiliate you and Felix's
alpha-male need to impress his family...

20:33.198 --> 20:36.198
would drive him to "save me...
and give me a great deal on the car.

20:37.302 --> 20:40.302
Not to pat myself on the back, but we,re ahead
of schedule. I thought it would take two years.

20:41.340 --> 20:44.108
I lost out on becoming a man.

20:44.109 --> 20:46.177
I cleaned strangers, toilets.

20:49.948 --> 20:52.683
All to save $10 a month?

20:52.684 --> 20:55.684
That's right, baby.
Enjoy it.

20:56.922 --> 20:59.922
God, it's great to win again!
Oh! I still got it, honey!

21:00.292 --> 21:02.827
Yeah! I won!
I won!

21:02.828 --> 21:05.663
Hey, who's up for some ice cream?
Huh? Hayley? Ice cream?

21:05.664 --> 21:08.664
Steve? Francine? Hayley? Oh, I asked you
already. Can't remember what you said.

21:09.968 --> 21:12.968
God, I don't remember
the last time I felt so good!
