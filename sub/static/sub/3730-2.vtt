00:00.339 --> 00:01.538
<i>Previously on "The Whispers"...</i>

00:01.539 --> 00:02.836
Who are you talking to?

00:03.136 --> 00:04.369
Drill. He says you're "it."

00:07.640 --> 00:10.375
Tell me about this game.
I'm not supposed to say.

00:10.426 --> 00:11.960
Who said that? My friend Drill.

00:12.011 --> 00:13.428
He speaks through the lights.

00:13.463 --> 00:15.714
He's not here anymore.

00:15.765 --> 00:19.317
He's looking for a new friend.
Okay. Now what?

00:19.352 --> 00:21.603
Her dad is with the defense
department, special projects.

00:21.637 --> 00:23.488
He actually got called
to Africa this morning.

00:23.523 --> 00:25.056
What is that thing?

00:25.091 --> 00:27.809
My husband was killed three
months ago in a plane crash.

00:27.860 --> 00:28.810
I have my son.

00:28.861 --> 00:30.262
He got sick. He lost his hearing.

00:30.296 --> 00:31.730
Thank you for fixing me.

00:31.814 --> 00:33.398
It'll be our little secret, Drill.

00:34.450 --> 00:35.617
Jackson Bellings, age 10.

00:35.651 --> 00:38.837
Detonated a homemade bomb
at Westings designs.

00:38.871 --> 00:41.623
"Under the influence of an
imaginary entity named 'Drill.'"

00:41.657 --> 00:43.074
There was someone across the street.

00:43.076 --> 00:44.626
A man watching the building.

00:44.660 --> 00:47.145
- What's your name?
- I don't know.

00:47.179 --> 00:49.297
We found Sean's plane.
Sean's body... it's missing.

00:49.331 --> 00:52.250
Sean Bennigan can
no longer be presumed deceased.

_

02:45.529 --> 02:46.495
Yeah.

02:48.832 --> 02:52.118
Hey. What is it?

02:53.704 --> 02:59.209
Hey. You and I,
we don't have secrets, right?

03:01.703 --> 03:03.203
_

03:09.052 --> 03:10.219
Hold on one second.

03:13.891 --> 03:15.991
Coming.

03:45.171 --> 03:46.671
_

03:47.557 --> 03:49.992
Mnh-mnh.

03:50.026 --> 03:51.677
No one.

03:51.728 --> 03:53.846
Must have been...

03:53.897 --> 03:55.514
Never mind.

03:55.565 --> 04:00.903
You were telling me about your friend.

04:02.865 --> 04:05.265
_

04:05.408 --> 04:08.944
I can't wait to meet him.

04:51.371 --> 04:53.655
Rollins, I need more time.

04:53.706 --> 04:57.492
I'm asking you to hold off
on releasing the sketch,

04:57.577 --> 04:58.961
just for a few hours.

04:58.976 --> 05:00.810
And I'm asking you to explain why.

05:00.844 --> 05:02.478
If you're working on an angle,
I need to know about it.

05:02.513 --> 05:04.814
In case you've forgotten,
that's how partners work.

05:04.848 --> 05:07.483
- I'm not shutting you out.
- You sure about that?

05:07.517 --> 05:09.268
Yes. We need more to go on.

05:09.270 --> 05:13.439
Meet me at Capitol University
Hospital in two hours.

05:13.441 --> 05:16.442
What's at the hospital?

05:16.444 --> 05:19.578
The only person we know
who's talked to Drill.

05:19.613 --> 05:21.948
Hold on a second.

05:42.552 --> 05:45.187
Wes.

05:45.222 --> 05:47.973
Uh, I got in late.
I didn't want to wake you.

05:47.975 --> 05:49.058
I was gonna let you sleep,

05:49.109 --> 05:50.976
but your phone's been ringing all morning.

05:50.978 --> 05:53.312
I figured it was important.

05:53.314 --> 05:56.065
Nah, it's this desert situation.

05:56.116 --> 05:58.918
- I got to go in.
- You need to talk to Minx.

05:58.952 --> 06:01.070
She has this new friend.

06:01.121 --> 06:04.990
He's been telling her stuff... about us.

06:05.025 --> 06:07.543
I guess the whole neighborhood knows.

06:07.577 --> 06:10.212
Lena...

06:10.246 --> 06:14.133
I know. You're sorry.

06:24.775 --> 06:26.277
Daddy's home.

06:26.375 --> 06:31.162
So, I can't print it here,
Drill. He'll find out.

06:31.213 --> 06:33.631
Okay, okay.

06:33.711 --> 06:35.328
Think of another way.

06:36.831 --> 06:39.332
Hey, Minx.

06:39.334 --> 06:41.834
Hi, daddy.

06:41.836 --> 06:45.504
Hey, honey. Can you come
over here for a minute?

06:45.506 --> 06:47.673
I want to talk to you.

06:50.394 --> 06:54.013
So, I've been hearing all about your...

06:54.064 --> 06:56.349
Your new friend,

06:56.400 --> 06:59.018
and he's been telling you
things about us, right?

07:00.103 --> 07:02.088
And where did he hear these things?

07:02.122 --> 07:03.906
Did his parents tell him or...?

07:03.941 --> 07:05.858
He doesn't have any parents.

07:05.909 --> 07:08.527
Okay, Minx, I...

07:12.165 --> 07:14.283
I want to meet Drill.

07:14.334 --> 07:17.286
But you can't. Grown-ups can't see him.

07:17.337 --> 07:20.956
Okay, so...

07:21.008 --> 07:24.877
We can't see him, but... but kids can?

07:24.879 --> 07:29.265
Some kids, in the lights.
But you have to be chosen.

07:29.299 --> 07:32.101
Okay. You know what?

07:32.135 --> 07:36.438
Let's forget about Drill for now, okay?

07:36.473 --> 07:39.808
So, your mom and I...

07:39.893 --> 07:42.144
I know we haven't been very nice
to each other lately.

07:42.195 --> 07:45.064
You talk in nice voices,
but you don't sound so nice.

07:45.098 --> 07:48.617
I think that's a very good way to put it.

07:48.652 --> 07:50.119
But I want you to know something.

07:50.153 --> 07:51.871
Just because we don't sound nice,

07:51.951 --> 07:53.973
that doesn't mean we don't love each other.

07:54.007 --> 07:56.008
But no matter what,

07:56.042 --> 07:59.495
the three of us... we are a family.

07:59.546 --> 08:01.680
Nothing is gonna change that.

08:01.715 --> 08:04.667
- Promise?
- Double promise.

08:10.173 --> 08:13.509
Did you bring me back something from Mali?

08:13.560 --> 08:14.843
- Did you think I'd forget?
- Mnh-mnh.

08:14.894 --> 08:19.181
Okay. Now, where would I have put it?

08:20.767 --> 08:22.267
Mm... That one.

08:22.269 --> 08:24.436
Wrong.

08:28.943 --> 08:30.192
Okay.

08:30.243 --> 08:35.664
It goes, uh, right...Here.

08:35.698 --> 08:40.034
Right there. Good girl.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.112
Where is he? Where is he, Wes?

09:08.137 --> 09:09.421
Have you lost your mind?
If Lena saw us here...

09:09.449 --> 09:11.066
- I have been calling all morning.
- Hey, we cannot do this here.

09:11.117 --> 09:12.901
- Sorry, okay?
- No, no! You hear me?! You don't do that!

09:12.952 --> 09:14.903
It's been... it's been crazy.
I just got back, okay?

09:14.954 --> 09:16.571
Calm down.

09:20.410 --> 09:23.044
Sorry.

09:23.079 --> 09:25.714
Just...

09:25.748 --> 09:29.551
Just tell me, is he alive?

09:29.585 --> 09:30.886
I don't know.

09:30.920 --> 09:32.003
What do you mean, you don't know?

09:32.005 --> 09:33.672
We found his plane thousands of miles away

09:33.674 --> 09:36.341
from where he was supposed to
have disappeared.

09:36.343 --> 09:39.010
There's evidence someone walked
away from that crash, Claire,

09:39.111 --> 09:40.341
but whether it was Sean...

09:48.321 --> 09:50.689
There's something you need to see.

09:50.691 --> 09:56.528
This man was...
Was seen here a month ago...

09:56.579 --> 09:59.581
Just outside Westings Industrial Designs

09:59.615 --> 10:01.249
moments before the bombing.

10:01.283 --> 10:02.917
I... I don't understand. This is Sean.

10:02.952 --> 10:05.420
Yeah, I know. Maybe.

10:07.206 --> 10:11.042
But if it is...

10:11.044 --> 10:14.045
If it's Sean and he survived

10:14.047 --> 10:18.716
and he's here, why didn't he come home?

10:24.974 --> 10:26.357
You have to understand,

10:26.392 --> 10:28.026
I shouldn't have even told you
what I saw in the desert.

10:28.060 --> 10:29.277
He's my husband.

10:29.311 --> 10:31.279
Who has now been deemed
a national-security threat.

10:31.313 --> 10:32.780
- Do you know what that means?
- Mm-hmm.

10:32.815 --> 10:34.198
I can't talk to you or it's treason.

10:34.233 --> 10:36.534
Come on, Wes.

10:36.568 --> 10:41.372
Since when have you been worried
about breaking the rules?

10:41.407 --> 10:43.708
Since I broke too many of them.

10:46.545 --> 10:48.162
Okay, look, she's...

10:48.213 --> 10:52.800
She's giving me a second chance, okay?

10:52.835 --> 10:55.420
I know.

10:55.471 --> 10:58.756
But...

10:58.758 --> 11:02.760
My second chance died for me
the day Sean's plane went down.

11:02.762 --> 11:06.597
And now... Wes, if this is true...

11:09.268 --> 11:12.603
I have to find him.

12:41.751 --> 12:45.554
Mommy's not sleeping, is she?

12:45.588 --> 12:47.323
Daddy says mommy's body's here,

12:47.386 --> 12:48.970
but her spirit's somewhere else.

12:48.972 --> 12:51.056
He says you're trying to find it.

12:51.107 --> 12:53.391
That's exactly what I'm doing.

12:53.442 --> 12:56.478
Daddy thinks I don't know, but I do.

12:56.480 --> 13:00.315
Mommy's dying, isn't she?

13:10.042 --> 13:12.661
Your mom is fighting, Harper,

13:12.712 --> 13:15.046
and I promise we're doing
everything we can.

13:15.081 --> 13:17.382
You won't be able to help her.

13:17.416 --> 13:19.084
That's what my friend said.

13:19.135 --> 13:22.037
Why would your friend say that?

13:22.071 --> 13:27.759
Because he said he's the only one who can.

13:29.261 --> 13:31.679
Clearly this guy is Drill.

13:31.681 --> 13:32.764
It's like you said.

13:32.815 --> 13:34.065
He's convincing the children he's not real.

13:34.100 --> 13:35.433
He's getting them to do stuff.

13:35.484 --> 13:37.519
All Ms. Bellings said
was that she saw this man

13:37.570 --> 13:40.772
before the bombing, but can't
prove a direct connection.

13:40.823 --> 13:42.357
Which is exactly why
we need to send the sketch out

13:42.359 --> 13:44.025
and see what hits we get
from the other bureau offices.

13:44.027 --> 13:45.193
Someone may know him.

13:45.195 --> 13:47.362
You're right. Someone may know him.

13:47.413 --> 13:48.696
That's why we're here.

13:55.104 --> 13:59.040
Harper, you see this man?

13:59.091 --> 14:00.875
Is this Drill?

14:03.262 --> 14:04.712
Harper.

14:06.682 --> 14:10.385
- Answer the question, okay?
- I can't. I'm not supposed to.

14:10.436 --> 14:14.138
Why? Did Drill say that to you?

14:14.189 --> 14:16.808
I know you think that Drill is your friend.

14:16.859 --> 14:21.229
But, Harper, listen to me.
Drill is not your friend.

14:21.231 --> 14:23.614
- He's dangerous.
- That's not true.

14:23.649 --> 14:25.566
He said he's going to make mommy better.

14:25.568 --> 14:27.568
No, he's... he's trying to trick you.

14:27.570 --> 14:28.986
He's not.

14:29.037 --> 14:31.489
He said you were gonna confuse
me, and that's what you do.

14:31.540 --> 14:33.942
This is enough.
We are not playing a game here.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.373
But it is a game.

14:35.424 --> 14:37.625
It's the most important game
of all, and I have to win.

14:38.623 --> 14:42.493
Please don't make me lose.
I want my mommy back.

14:42.544 --> 14:44.361
I know.

14:44.395 --> 14:46.830
I know. It's okay, Harper.

14:48.395 --> 14:50.429
I won't make you lose.

14:55.685 --> 14:57.269
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

14:57.320 --> 15:00.606
Could you... uh, would you mind
helping us for a second?

15:00.657 --> 15:01.740
Sure.

15:01.775 --> 15:05.577
Harper, hey, did Drill tell you

15:05.612 --> 15:08.414
that you couldn't talk to a doctor?

15:08.448 --> 15:10.699
Then you can tell her
about this man, right?

15:10.750 --> 15:12.367
She's not playing the game.

15:12.419 --> 15:13.952
I think so.

15:14.003 --> 15:16.455
Okay.

15:16.506 --> 15:19.291
Whisper into her ear
so that I can't hear you.

15:19.342 --> 15:20.959
Okay, Harper?

15:28.968 --> 15:31.386
I don't think this is right.

15:33.356 --> 15:34.973
Okay.

15:35.024 --> 15:37.309
I'm sorry.

15:40.313 --> 15:42.197
Excuse me.

15:42.231 --> 15:43.949
Is that the man you're looking for?

15:43.983 --> 15:46.818
Yes.

15:46.869 --> 15:48.286
Why? Do you know him?

15:48.321 --> 15:50.122
He was my patient last night.

15:50.156 --> 15:52.407
Wait. This man was here?

15:52.409 --> 15:56.161
Yes. But he ran away.

15:56.212 --> 15:58.914
Captain Bennigan.

15:58.916 --> 16:02.250
The night he disappeared,

16:02.285 --> 16:04.086
he wasn't on just a surveillance run.

16:04.153 --> 16:05.420
That was his cover.

16:05.422 --> 16:06.922
I didn't realize he flew secret ops.

16:06.924 --> 16:08.590
He was sent out to test a new weapon

16:08.624 --> 16:11.309
we've had in development
for the last six years.

16:11.344 --> 16:12.427
It was just before Captain Bennigan

16:12.429 --> 16:14.095
was about to launch the initial test,

16:14.097 --> 16:16.264
he disengaged his transponder.

16:16.266 --> 16:18.650
We lost contact with him.

16:18.684 --> 16:20.652
- Couldn't find him on radar.
- But that's not possible.

16:20.686 --> 16:23.989
You can't disengage
a transponder on an F-22.

16:24.023 --> 16:25.941
Which means Sean Bennigan had help.

16:25.992 --> 16:29.494
It also explains how he got
from the Arctic to the Sahara.

16:29.528 --> 16:30.996
He fueled up somewhere.

16:31.030 --> 16:33.498
He took the plane to the desert,
tested the weapon there.

16:33.532 --> 16:35.116
But something went wrong.

16:35.167 --> 16:36.785
And Captain Bennigan?

16:36.787 --> 16:38.670
Apparently, he survived.

16:38.704 --> 16:39.788
No, I... I just don't see

16:39.839 --> 16:40.789
how someone could walk away from that.

16:40.840 --> 16:42.040
That's what you're gonna find out.

16:42.091 --> 16:45.560
Find out what happened that night,

16:45.594 --> 16:50.048
and find out who Sean Bennigan
is/was working for.

16:50.099 --> 16:51.966
Yes, Mr. Secretary.

16:52.017 --> 16:54.853
I want two teams on this.

16:54.887 --> 16:56.688
Alpha, focus on the desert.

16:56.722 --> 16:58.373
I want our own scientists out there.

16:58.407 --> 17:00.508
I want to know if an accidental
or a planned discharge

17:00.543 --> 17:02.143
from our weapon could have caused this.

17:02.145 --> 17:04.479
Check all keyhole
satellite footage of the area.

17:04.481 --> 17:07.065
Check with Africom.
Someone somewhere saw something.

17:07.116 --> 17:08.349
Find it.

17:08.415 --> 17:11.165
Bravo, work on the assumption
captain Bennigan did survive.

17:11.217 --> 17:14.669
If so, a possible last sighting
could have taken place here...

17:14.720 --> 17:17.622
Westings Industrial Designs.

17:17.656 --> 17:19.424
Now, whether he's connected
to the bombing...

17:19.474 --> 17:21.926
That's what we need to find out.

17:21.978 --> 17:24.262
Where is he? What does he want?

17:25.175 --> 17:27.460
Sir, it says here
in Captain Bennigan's file

17:27.462 --> 17:30.263
that his family currently
resides in Baltimore.

17:30.297 --> 17:32.048
He could have made contact.

17:32.099 --> 17:33.517
I already spoke with his wife.
She hasn't heard from him.

17:33.598 --> 17:35.682
Still might help to put a tail
on her and the kid.

17:35.716 --> 17:37.767
Never know. The guy could come around.

17:41.389 --> 17:45.358
It's your move.
Maybe you'll get lucky, Tania.

17:45.393 --> 17:48.528
Okay.

17:52.783 --> 17:55.402
Oh, no! Dog ate your homework!

17:55.453 --> 17:57.871
Move back two spaces.

18:00.758 --> 18:02.659
You aced the test.

18:02.710 --> 18:03.993
Move to the head of the class.

18:03.995 --> 18:05.328
I win.

18:05.379 --> 18:07.831
You always win. It's not fair.

18:07.833 --> 18:10.166
Then let's play a game you can win.

18:10.168 --> 18:11.668
Okay. Which one?

18:13.921 --> 18:15.538
What's that?

18:15.573 --> 18:18.675
It's a new game, a secret game.

18:18.726 --> 18:20.260
Hardly anyone knows it.

18:21.525 --> 18:23.726
How do you play?

18:23.777 --> 18:27.113
Print out the file on the drive.

18:27.176 --> 18:29.811
The most important thing
about winning the game

18:29.846 --> 18:31.430
is that you can't show anyone.

18:31.481 --> 18:34.266
Then you automatically lose.

18:34.317 --> 18:36.435
This doesn't sound like a very fun game.

18:36.486 --> 18:37.819
But it is.

18:37.854 --> 18:41.106
If you win, my friend will show you magic.

18:41.157 --> 18:42.991
What kind of magic?

18:43.026 --> 18:45.827
Okay, I'll give you a sneak peek.

18:45.862 --> 18:48.113
But I'm not supposed to,
so don't tell anyone, okay?

18:52.368 --> 18:54.002
Drill?

18:56.123 --> 18:58.290
Hello, Tania.

18:58.292 --> 19:00.792
Would you like to be my friend?

19:02.845 --> 19:04.796
How did you do that?

19:04.847 --> 19:06.599
I told you, magic.

19:06.646 --> 19:09.634
So, are you gonna play or what?

19:11.246 --> 19:14.045
He doesn't remember anything...
No family, no home.

19:14.945 --> 19:16.679
All he knew was the last three months.

19:16.681 --> 19:19.265
Everything prior to that was gone.

19:19.316 --> 19:22.285
And did he give you any... any hints

19:22.319 --> 19:25.104
about where he might have been,
anyone he knew?

19:25.155 --> 19:26.272
No.

19:26.323 --> 19:28.241
I get the feeling he didn't have anyone.

19:28.275 --> 19:30.743
There was one thing.

19:30.778 --> 19:33.696
Um, when he was unconscious,
he was talking in Arabic,

19:33.747 --> 19:36.532
and he said something very strange.

19:36.583 --> 19:39.702
He said, "they're searching
for the lights."

19:39.704 --> 19:40.953
Any idea what that means?

19:41.005 --> 19:42.372
Sorry.

19:42.423 --> 19:43.706
How did he look?

19:43.757 --> 19:47.210
It hasn't been easy for him.
That was clear.

19:47.261 --> 19:49.929
Also, he had all these tattoos.

19:49.963 --> 19:50.930
What kind of tattoos?

19:50.964 --> 19:52.248
They were all very different.

19:52.266 --> 19:53.633
There was one here

19:53.684 --> 19:54.801
that looked like a tree house...

19:54.852 --> 19:56.469
You know, the ones kids play in?

19:56.520 --> 19:57.803
Tree house? You sure?

19:57.855 --> 19:59.806
Yes.

19:59.857 --> 20:01.057
This is our guy.

20:01.059 --> 20:03.893
What did he do?

20:03.895 --> 20:06.896
- He's just a person of interest on a case.
- Two cases.

20:06.898 --> 20:08.564
What about your security cameras?

20:08.566 --> 20:10.316
Security room's in the fourth floor.

20:10.367 --> 20:12.668
I'm sure they've already pulled the tapes

20:12.703 --> 20:14.320
in light of the attack last night.

20:14.371 --> 20:15.538
What attack?

20:20.077 --> 20:22.745
Stop.

20:22.747 --> 20:24.947
This guy is trained.

20:24.982 --> 20:26.615
Possibly military.

20:26.650 --> 20:28.584
We should get the sketch
to the various services,

20:28.586 --> 20:30.753
see if we get a hit.

20:32.422 --> 20:34.090
Agent Bennigan.

20:36.810 --> 20:38.928
Hey.

20:38.979 --> 20:40.346
What aren't you telling me?

20:40.397 --> 20:42.515
Now, you've been holding up
protocol on the sketch

20:42.566 --> 20:45.601
ever since you saw it, and now...

20:48.321 --> 20:49.772
You know who he is.

20:49.823 --> 20:51.774
I can't believe this. Who is he?

20:51.825 --> 20:53.776
- Jessup...
- Who is he?

20:57.280 --> 20:59.415
I think it might be my husband.

21:02.369 --> 21:04.670
Your husband?

21:04.704 --> 21:06.171
No, but I thought...

21:06.206 --> 21:07.840
That's what I thought.
That's what everyone thought.

21:07.874 --> 21:10.175
But...

21:10.210 --> 21:12.127
Last night, they found his plane.

21:12.129 --> 21:13.679
They didn't find his body.

21:13.713 --> 21:15.180
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that this...

21:15.215 --> 21:18.183
The man in that sketch, Jessup...

21:18.218 --> 21:23.188
That looks exactly like Sean.

21:23.223 --> 21:26.692
But... That man that
Dr. Benavidez described,

21:26.726 --> 21:29.695
that's... that's not Sean.

21:29.729 --> 21:32.214
He doesn't speak Arabic.
He doesn't have tattoos.

21:32.248 --> 21:35.818
He wouldn't just attack someone.
That's not him.

21:35.820 --> 21:39.188
But if you believe that,

21:39.205 --> 21:43.158
then you would have released
the sketch, and you didn't.

21:43.160 --> 21:44.710
- I needed more time.
- Time?

21:44.744 --> 21:46.211
Time like you just gave to this guy

21:46.246 --> 21:48.397
who's now running loose on the streets?

22:04.264 --> 22:06.565
Doctor?

22:06.599 --> 22:08.066
Dr. Benavidez!

22:08.101 --> 22:10.902
If he happens to come back, I
need you to call me right away.

22:12.105 --> 22:14.072
Don't call the cops.

22:16.492 --> 22:18.944
He needs help.

22:18.995 --> 22:21.530
I hope you find him.

22:24.283 --> 22:25.417
Yes, hello.

22:25.451 --> 22:27.586
I have an appointment with Dr. Benavidez.

22:27.620 --> 22:29.037
I'm running a bit late.

22:29.088 --> 22:33.542
Do you think you could tell me
what time she's on duty till?

22:33.593 --> 22:36.044
6:00 P.M.

22:36.095 --> 22:37.879
Um, I'm gonna have to reschedule.

22:37.930 --> 22:39.214
Thank you so much.

22:48.858 --> 22:51.142
Sir, you have to see this.

22:51.193 --> 22:53.144
What do we have?

22:53.195 --> 22:56.981
Over Africa, the satellite feeds
have caught something.

22:57.033 --> 22:59.618
We only have the last few
seconds of the crash, but look.

22:59.652 --> 23:02.120
Is this the aftermath of the weapon launch?

23:02.154 --> 23:03.488
That's what I initially thought,

23:03.539 --> 23:06.074
but when I examined the radial
direction of the explosion,

23:06.076 --> 23:08.076
it doesn't match the signature
of a weapon drop.

23:08.078 --> 23:10.412
So what?

23:10.414 --> 23:12.247
I don't have that yet.

23:12.249 --> 23:13.798
But look at the rest of the photos.

23:13.833 --> 23:16.301
The satellite is programmed

23:16.335 --> 23:18.303
to take a frame every 40 seconds.

23:18.337 --> 23:20.305
Here's the series.

23:23.392 --> 23:25.844
Wait. What...

23:25.895 --> 23:27.011
What's that?

23:30.900 --> 23:32.517
The fulgurite.

23:32.568 --> 23:35.687
Is it moving?

23:37.439 --> 23:39.574
It's not the fulgurite.

23:57.251 --> 24:00.220
Lena, I can't talk right now, okay?

24:02.506 --> 24:04.841
What's wrong? What happened?

24:04.843 --> 24:07.677
What's going on here?

24:07.679 --> 24:09.479
Wes.

24:09.578 --> 24:11.078
I had to let them in. They had a warrant.

24:11.080 --> 24:12.413
Hey, what are they telling you?

24:12.464 --> 24:14.415
Something about accessing restricted files.

24:14.466 --> 24:15.416
I... I don't know.

24:15.418 --> 24:17.418
All right, I'll figure this out.

24:17.420 --> 24:18.919
Take Minx and go over to Callie's.

24:18.921 --> 24:19.920
I'm not leaving you here.

24:19.971 --> 24:22.089
Okay, I'll... I'll take care of this.

24:22.091 --> 24:24.258
Alex, what the hell is this about?

24:24.309 --> 24:26.593
Last night, 10:24 P.M.,

24:26.595 --> 24:29.096
your D.O.D. server was accessed.

24:29.098 --> 24:31.014
Restricted files were downloaded
against protocol.

24:31.066 --> 24:33.065
That doesn't make sense.
I wasn't even here.

24:33.066 --> 24:34.015
I was out of the country.

24:34.065 --> 24:36.265
Which is why we're taking
your computer to figure out who.

24:38.365 --> 24:41.300
You have a guess on that?

24:41.365 --> 24:43.100
I can't believe you're
really accusing me of this.

24:43.165 --> 24:44.299
Then who, Lena? Who did this?

24:44.333 --> 24:45.500
I don't know!

24:45.551 --> 24:47.168
But the fact that you could
even think it was me...

24:47.219 --> 24:48.503
My God, we're in worse shape
than I thought.

24:48.554 --> 24:49.971
Instead of going at each other,

24:50.005 --> 24:51.556
maybe we should try and figure out

24:51.590 --> 24:52.974
how someone got into our home.

24:53.008 --> 24:56.811
You think I was spying on you,

24:56.845 --> 24:58.429
checking to see if you e-mailed her

24:58.480 --> 24:59.647
from your work computer.

24:59.681 --> 25:01.816
I... I was wrong, okay? I'm sorry.

25:01.850 --> 25:03.484
Well, are you?

25:03.519 --> 25:04.852
Am I what?

25:04.903 --> 25:06.270
Are you talking to her?

25:06.321 --> 25:07.438
Oh, you really want to do this now

25:07.489 --> 25:08.773
with the feds crawling all over this place?

25:08.775 --> 25:11.025
Oh, come on, Wes.
They probably already know.

25:11.076 --> 25:12.777
I mean, the two of you...

25:12.828 --> 25:14.445
How discreet were you really at the office?

25:16.415 --> 25:21.669
If I could go back
and change things, I would.

25:21.703 --> 25:25.206
But I can't.

25:25.257 --> 25:29.794
But if there is something
that I... I can do,

25:29.828 --> 25:32.513
then... then tell me.

25:32.547 --> 25:35.349
I will do it.

25:35.384 --> 25:39.020
I want all of this to stop.

25:39.054 --> 25:43.190
I want the FBI to not be in our home

25:43.225 --> 25:45.026
and look at us like we're terrorists.

25:45.060 --> 25:47.978
I want our daughter to stop
talking to an imaginary friend

25:48.760 --> 25:51.261
who makes her feel like crap.

25:51.312 --> 25:54.598
And I want so badly to stop hating you.

25:54.600 --> 25:57.934
But the truth is,
ever since you were with her,

25:57.936 --> 26:03.106
ever since it happened,
everything has gone wrong.

26:03.108 --> 26:05.325
So you know what I want you to do, Wes?

26:05.359 --> 26:07.160
I want you to fix it.

26:07.194 --> 26:08.278
Stop it!

26:11.332 --> 26:13.116
Stop fighting.

26:13.167 --> 26:14.284
Oh, Minx, uh, honey...

26:14.286 --> 26:16.786
It was me.

26:19.624 --> 26:22.709
I'm the one who went into daddy's computer.

26:25.513 --> 26:29.215
You're supposed to be yelling at me.

26:41.661 --> 26:45.365
Mom, uh, is Henry with you?

26:45.460 --> 26:48.979
Okay, do me a favor. Just keep him inside.

26:49.060 --> 26:51.979
No, nothing.

26:52.013 --> 26:54.932
Just keep a close eye on him.
I'll explain later.

26:54.983 --> 26:56.433
Mom, hold on a second.

26:56.485 --> 26:59.270
Ohh. Dr. Benavidez, you okay?

26:59.321 --> 27:01.772
No. My wallet and my keys.

27:01.823 --> 27:04.275
I... I'm sure they were here
when I started my shift,

27:04.326 --> 27:06.610
but I... I can't find them now.

27:06.661 --> 27:09.780
I'll... I'll check with security.

27:13.034 --> 27:16.537
Mom... mom, I know. I got to go.

27:16.539 --> 27:18.038
Keep an eye on Henry for me.

29:14.575 --> 29:17.575
You want me to believe
that your 8-year-old daughter

29:17.675 --> 29:19.675
accessed top-secret defense files.

29:19.709 --> 29:22.511
The truth, Alex. Look, I... I know it's bad.

29:22.546 --> 29:25.381
We're dealing with it.
I'm asking you to understand.

29:25.398 --> 29:27.683
You mean you're asking me to let it go.

29:27.734 --> 29:28.934
You don't have a case.

29:28.985 --> 29:30.769
Go through with this.
You'll see how it turns out.

29:30.820 --> 29:34.106
And, trust me, it doesn't come
out looking good for you guys.

29:34.157 --> 29:38.410
Look at you. Big job at defense.

29:38.445 --> 29:40.079
You're making this personal.

29:40.113 --> 29:41.447
You never liked me. That was always clear.

29:41.498 --> 29:43.615
Because guys like you,

29:43.666 --> 29:45.200
you're always looking for that climb.

29:45.251 --> 29:46.702
I was a good agent, Alex.

29:46.753 --> 29:48.086
But that wasn't good enough for you.

29:48.121 --> 29:50.122
Well, I wasn't after your job,
if that's what you thought.

29:50.173 --> 29:51.540
I wasn't worried about you taking my job.

29:51.542 --> 29:53.041
Then what?

29:53.076 --> 29:56.712
You knew how shaky things were
at home for her.

29:56.714 --> 29:58.213
We all did.

29:58.264 --> 30:00.883
But not all of us took advantage of it.

30:00.934 --> 30:02.935
You think I took advantage of Claire.

30:02.969 --> 30:04.102
You were her superior, Wes.

30:04.137 --> 30:07.556
You have no idea what she and I had.

30:11.811 --> 30:15.113
I'm not talking to you
about this in my house.

30:15.148 --> 30:18.116
Get out now.

30:18.151 --> 30:20.118
I think we have everything we need.

30:20.153 --> 30:22.287
Our forensics team
will go through that computer.

30:22.322 --> 30:23.789
Yeah, you go through that computer.

30:27.493 --> 30:29.961
Jessup, what's the situation?

30:29.996 --> 30:33.298
W... Wait a minute. What are you telling me?

31:08.975 --> 31:11.143
Sir, we have an update on
the tail on the captain's wife.

31:11.145 --> 31:12.478
Okay, what do you have?

31:12.480 --> 31:14.813
She just arrived at the home
of Dr. Maria Benavidez,

31:14.815 --> 31:16.482
and she went in armed.

31:16.484 --> 31:18.150
Okay, I'm... I'm... I'm on my way.

31:18.152 --> 31:19.651
Do not approach until I get there.

32:18.211 --> 32:20.295
I'm about a block away.

32:20.346 --> 32:22.931
Wait, wait. I... I see her.

32:34.227 --> 32:35.393
Claire!

32:48.241 --> 32:49.791
Hey! Watch out!

32:49.825 --> 32:51.076
- Watch it!
- Hey!

33:51.053 --> 33:53.688
Claire?

33:53.722 --> 33:56.474
Claire.

33:56.476 --> 33:57.692
Did you see him?

33:57.726 --> 33:59.193
I don't know.

33:59.228 --> 34:01.195
W... What do you mean? W... Was it Sean?

34:01.230 --> 34:04.532
I...

34:04.566 --> 34:06.284
I never got a good look at him.

34:15.116 --> 34:16.514
Right now my family needs me, sir.

34:18.014 --> 34:19.233
We don't know.

34:19.315 --> 34:21.600
The doctors don't have a timeline.

34:21.634 --> 34:23.768
We're taking it day by day.

34:23.803 --> 34:25.437
Yes.

34:25.471 --> 34:28.473
I realize it will take
a few days to get a replacement.

34:35.960 --> 34:38.328
Mommy?

34:41.659 --> 34:44.245
Mommy?

34:44.246 --> 34:47.248
You said you were gonna help me.

34:47.282 --> 34:48.583
You promised.

34:58.393 --> 35:00.645
Mommy! Mommy! Wake up!

35:04.983 --> 35:09.637
Okay, what do I do next?

35:11.239 --> 35:14.358
Oh, no. Come with me.

35:14.409 --> 35:17.378
Boys and girls,
do you think you can help Teddy

35:17.412 --> 35:19.363
find his way home?

35:19.414 --> 35:21.699
Use the map!

35:21.750 --> 35:23.501
A map, you say?

35:45.440 --> 35:47.558
That's it!

35:54.816 --> 35:57.651
Teddy, what you need is a map.

35:57.653 --> 35:59.820
Map, map, map, map, map.

35:59.822 --> 36:01.989
Oh.

36:01.991 --> 36:02.990
Where is it?

36:02.992 --> 36:05.659
Henry, who's here?

36:05.710 --> 36:08.328
Who's talking?

36:09.610 --> 36:11.711
_

36:13.968 --> 36:16.059
- Mm, I heard someone.
- That's it.

36:16.084 --> 36:17.888
Very good, boys and girls.

36:17.922 --> 36:20.340
You helped Teddy find his way home.

36:20.391 --> 36:22.509
It's not fun being lost, is it?

36:22.560 --> 36:26.179
You should be in bed, okay?

36:45.166 --> 36:49.069
I'm sorry, Drill.

36:49.103 --> 36:52.789
I know it's supposed to be a secret.

37:04.685 --> 37:06.136
What do you got?

37:06.187 --> 37:08.972
Still no hits on Captain Bennigan.

37:09.023 --> 37:11.975
We've run through all
the facial-recognition systems.

37:12.026 --> 37:13.977
So far, nothing.

37:14.028 --> 37:15.762
What about her?

37:15.796 --> 37:18.899
She's gone back to the house
he was squatting in.

37:18.950 --> 37:19.749
You want us to bring her in?

37:19.750 --> 37:22.918
No. That won't be necessary.
We have what we need.

37:41.216 --> 37:43.951
Thank you, Drill.

37:45.015 --> 37:47.483
I don't want to be home anymore.

38:54.050 --> 38:56.835
What kind of game did you say this was?

39:00.573 --> 39:02.508
A maze?

39:04.644 --> 39:06.762
Where does it lead to?

39:10.811 --> 39:12.511
Oh I see.

39:15.611 --> 39:17.830
Yeah, I just got the car started.

39:17.910 --> 39:20.695
Yeah. Yeah.

39:20.746 --> 39:22.363
No, it's all good. Thank you.

39:22.414 --> 39:24.198
Yeah.

39:24.249 --> 39:26.868
Okay, thank you very much. Thank you. Bye.

39:35.127 --> 39:39.263
There's something I need to do.
You're gonna help me.
