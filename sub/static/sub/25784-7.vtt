00:04.092 --> 00:05.342
ISSA DEE: I'm about to throw
a block party.

00:05.426 --> 00:07.676
-You need a form for each act.
-Some of the acts are TBD.

00:07.843 --> 00:10.925
But I am on my way
to "D'ing" 'em. (LAUGHS)

00:12.301 --> 00:14.426
Which one is Andrew? Is he
the black one or the Asian one?

00:14.509 --> 00:16.801
-MOLLY CARTER: The Asian one.
-Just try it out!

00:16.884 --> 00:19.843
Sometimes people
can surprise you. Like Nathan.

00:19.925 --> 00:22.050
-How do you know when it's real?
-It feels...

00:22.384 --> 00:25.217
-pretty real to me.
-Yeah, it does.

00:26.593 --> 00:27.967
I should probably go say hi
to Lawrence.

00:28.050 --> 00:30.634
-Uh, it's good to see... again.
-Yeah, you too.

00:30.718 --> 00:34.843
-How was Lawrence? Wow.
-I think I'm finally over him.

00:36.259 --> 00:38.718
-What's wrong with you?
-Nathan hasn't been picking up.

00:38.967 --> 00:40.384
He hasn't hit me back
in a minute.

00:48.217 --> 00:50.925
( music playing )

01:00.426 --> 01:01.467
( sharp gasp )

01:01.551 --> 01:04.759
Issa:
These dreams are so weird.

01:04.843 --> 01:06.676
Why am I always
losing my teeth?

01:06.759 --> 01:08.801
I need to look up
what that means.

01:08.884 --> 01:10.301
What time is it?

01:13.217 --> 01:15.925
Ooh. I forgot to eat these.
I'm hungry.

01:21.634 --> 01:23.551
What day is it?

01:23.634 --> 01:26.426
Really, Nathan?
A whole-ass week?

01:27.925 --> 01:30.009
Fuck that.
Stop thinking about him,

01:30.092 --> 01:32.175
and start thinking
about this block party.

01:32.259 --> 01:33.301
OK.

01:37.676 --> 01:40.134
- ( phone buzzing )
- Nathan?

01:40.217 --> 01:43.050
Ooh! Taye Diggs followed me?
That's what's up.

01:43.134 --> 01:45.301
Damn, that nigga
follows everyone.

01:45.384 --> 01:47.259
I wonder if he follows Nathan.

01:47.342 --> 01:49.467

Florence and Crenshaw.

02:34.509 --> 02:35.884

who orders crawfish tail

- Mm-hmm.

02:42.384 --> 02:43.759

to notice.

02:43.843 --> 02:45.593
Well, I can fix that,
Molly Squared.

02:45.676 --> 02:48.259
You want
a Thug's Passion?

02:48.342 --> 02:50.426
Are we still talkin'
about the drink, or...?

02:50.509 --> 02:51.925
I am now.

02:52.009 --> 02:53.009

02:58.050 --> 03:00.050
So why'd you dodge me
for so long?

03:01.259 --> 03:02.551
Honestly...

03:03.843 --> 03:06.801
I was embarrassed
by Coachella.

03:06.884 --> 03:09.967
I was doin' the most,
and you didn't need
to see all that.

03:10.050 --> 03:11.801
Well, maybe
that's a good thing.

03:11.884 --> 03:13.843
We don't have to pretend
with each other.

03:15.593 --> 03:17.134
- True.
- Mm-hmm.

03:17.217 --> 03:20.342
Well, since
we're not pretending,

03:20.426 --> 03:22.551
I do gotta get back to work.

03:22.634 --> 03:25.301
On a Saturday?
OK.

03:25.384 --> 03:26.676
No, for real!

03:26.759 --> 03:28.384
I got a lot of work to do,

03:28.467 --> 03:31.718
and I'm trying to redeem myself
with this presentation.

03:34.801 --> 03:39.467
But I mean,
if you're free tomorrow,
maybe we can hang out.

03:39.551 --> 03:42.092
Well, you bring the passion,
I'll bring the thug.

03:42.175 --> 03:44.175
( laughs )
You were doing so well.

03:44.259 --> 03:45.593
Come on. Say it.
Say it out loud. Say it.

03:45.676 --> 03:47.384
- No. ( laughs )
- Come on. It's good!

03:47.467 --> 03:50.384
You said Florence and Crenshaw.
I gotta bring a little thug.

03:50.467 --> 03:52.593
- Leave that to me.
- OK.

03:52.676 --> 03:55.509
Bro, you got baby hair.
There's nothing thug about you.

03:55.593 --> 03:57.384

Lawrence:
You're trippin', bruh.

04:01.426 --> 04:04.426
I am not trippin'.
That big muthafucka
got way too physical.

04:04.509 --> 04:07.509
Yo, you called a foul
before he even touched you.

04:07.593 --> 04:09.676
He was coming
straight for my face, bruh.

04:09.759 --> 04:11.509

the same thing...

is speakin' to you today,

and you want to recommit
your life to the Lord...

09:14.801 --> 09:18.301
stand up, beg Jesus
to take you back.

09:19.426 --> 09:20.384

present in chambers for 10:30.

Oh, dang.
Will you still be back in time
for our presentation?

10:02.634 --> 10:04.259
Not sure.
I need to postpone it.

10:04.342 --> 10:06.134
Postpone it? ( stammers )

10:06.217 --> 10:08.217
I just found the perfect
precedent for the case.

10:08.301 --> 10:10.634

to look at it first.

10:12.551 --> 10:14.634

10:26.342 --> 10:27.801

Right? I mean,
it just spoke to me, bruh.

10:31.092 --> 10:34.342
I don't know, man.
My yoke just had
hella bondage.

10:35.509 --> 10:38.050
- All right, love you, man.
- Yeah.

10:38.134 --> 10:40.467

10:40.551 --> 10:43.217

10:46.884 --> 10:48.593
You didn't
want to get saved?

10:48.676 --> 10:51.593
Ha. Uh,
it was my first time,

10:51.676 --> 10:54.925
and I feel like you gotta
work your way up to that.

10:55.009 --> 10:57.925
I get it.
I had to warm up
to the pop metaphors.

10:58.009 --> 11:00.009
So you been
comin' here for a while?

11:00.092 --> 11:02.259
Yeah. It's a great service.
I've met some good folk.

11:02.342 --> 11:05.676
I really  get my spirit fed.
I've gotten a lot out of it.

11:05.759 --> 11:08.843
Yeah. That's what
I'm hopin' for, too.

11:08.925 --> 11:12.217
Plus, the after-service
snacks are bomb.

11:12.301 --> 11:13.925
You know I got a cruller
in my pocket, right?

11:14.009 --> 11:15.009
( laughs )

11:19.217 --> 11:21.217
Thanks for comin' early.
Hey.

11:21.301 --> 11:23.092
- Mwah.
- Ordered you a rosé.

11:23.175 --> 11:25.551
- You're buying, right?
- ( Molly laughs )

11:25.634 --> 11:27.009
You got jokes.

11:27.092 --> 11:29.342
How's the presentation
coming along?

11:29.426 --> 11:30.967
It's supposed
to be tomorrow,

11:31.050 --> 11:34.134
but my partner,
he keeps micromanaging me.

11:34.217 --> 11:37.301
- Ooh. Just beat him up.
- What?

11:37.384 --> 11:40.175
Molly Squared told me
she had a bully phase.

11:40.259 --> 11:42.843
She did, huh?
She talk too much.

11:42.925 --> 11:44.467
I don't know.
She's a lot of fun.

11:44.551 --> 11:46.967
Said a lot of things.

11:47.050 --> 11:48.301
Nnnn.

11:48.384 --> 11:50.718
What, you don't remember?

11:50.801 --> 11:53.467
No, I don't.

11:53.551 --> 11:55.801
Well, good, 'cause
I told you stuff, too.

11:55.884 --> 11:59.342
- Oh, right, you did.
- Mm-hmm.

11:59.426 --> 12:01.676
Like how you told me
you auditioned for B2K?

12:01.759 --> 12:03.676
Oh, look who got
her memory back.

12:03.759 --> 12:05.050
( laughs )

12:05.134 --> 12:07.134
- Mm-hmm.
- It's inconvenient.

12:07.217 --> 12:09.509
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

12:09.593 --> 12:12.676
So, uh, how's the food here?

12:12.759 --> 12:14.175
Oh, it's real good.
Mm-hmm.

12:14.259 --> 12:16.050
Makes me wanna go
"bump, bump, bump."

12:16.134 --> 12:18.551
OK, listen,
I woulda been in,
I was in.

12:18.634 --> 12:19.884
( both laugh )

12:19.967 --> 12:21.967
But you know what else
I remember?

12:22.050 --> 12:26.050
You telling me how you kissed
your boy's girlfriend.

12:26.134 --> 12:28.301
- OK.
- Grimy.

12:28.384 --> 12:31.759
Oh, says the girl
who hooked up with
her married friend?

12:31.843 --> 12:33.342
Mm-hmm.

12:33.426 --> 12:35.967
Grime recognize grime.

12:38.884 --> 12:40.342
I'm not grimy,

12:40.426 --> 12:42.342
and you don't know
the situation.

12:42.426 --> 12:45.259
OK. Tell me
the situation.

12:45.342 --> 12:47.718
Um...

12:47.801 --> 12:50.342
he led me to believe
it was something it wasn't.

12:51.342 --> 12:53.342
A married man led you on?

12:53.426 --> 12:55.426
Wow. ( laughs )

12:55.509 --> 12:58.050
- Come on.
- That's not funny.

12:58.134 --> 12:59.759
Sorry, I--
I was just playin'.

12:59.843 --> 13:02.050
I didn't know it was still
a sore subject.

13:02.134 --> 13:03.384
I don't give a fuck.

13:03.467 --> 13:05.009
People out here
lookin' out for themselves,

13:05.092 --> 13:07.092
so I'm lookin' out for me.

13:07.175 --> 13:08.301
OK.

13:17.134 --> 13:18.718
You know, you can, uh...

13:18.801 --> 13:21.175
you can beat me up,
if you want to.

13:23.301 --> 13:25.634
- No, I just wanna leave.
- For real?

13:25.718 --> 13:27.092
Molly. What?

13:27.175 --> 13:29.843
Molly. Hold on.
Hold on. Hey.

13:29.925 --> 13:31.676
( phone buzzing )

13:31.759 --> 13:34.676
Issa:
What's that sound?
My teeth fallin' out?

13:34.759 --> 13:38.259
- ( phone buzzing )
- Is that Nathan?
Please be Nathan.

13:38.342 --> 13:39.718
( buzzing )

13:39.801 --> 13:42.134
- Hello?
- Hey, it's Roger.

13:42.217 --> 13:45.217
- Issa: Who Roger?
- I own the building.

13:45.301 --> 13:48.134
Yes, Roger. Of course, Roger.
Hi... Roger.

13:48.217 --> 13:51.009
The plumber's been waiting
outside for 20 minutes.

13:51.092 --> 13:53.217
You were supposed
to meet him at 8:30.

13:53.301 --> 13:55.134
Yep. Here I come.

14:01.676 --> 14:04.759
Issa:
How did you oversleep,
idiot girl?

14:04.843 --> 14:07.467
Hold up.
It's not your fault.

14:07.551 --> 14:08.967
It's Nathan's fault.

14:09.050 --> 14:11.009
Fuckin' up my livelihood,

and cuttin' hair and shit,

14:25.301 --> 14:27.342
but you can't text
nobody back?

14:27.426 --> 14:29.801
You can't take the time
to text or call me?!

Hey, Molly,
any word on when
Taurean will be back?

14:42.217 --> 14:44.467
Oh, I haven't
heard from him today.

14:44.551 --> 14:47.342
- OK, well...
- But I'm excited for you guys

14:47.426 --> 14:48.718
to hear what
we've put together.

14:48.801 --> 14:50.593
- Yeah?
- I found some new research

14:50.676 --> 14:52.342
on the proper accommodations

14:52.426 --> 14:54.384
for employees
with substance abuse.

14:54.467 --> 14:56.925
You're gonna be,
like, "Whoa!"

14:57.009 --> 14:58.050
Sounds good.

14:58.134 --> 14:59.843
Well, let us know
when Taurean gets back.

14:59.925 --> 15:01.426
He's always got clever ways

15:01.509 --> 15:03.551
to keep defendants
on the ropes.

15:03.634 --> 15:05.050
Keep me posted.

15:06.092 --> 15:07.759
Or, um...

15:07.843 --> 15:11.801
I can... pinch-hit
and do the presentation now.

15:11.884 --> 15:13.634
- Oh.
- I mean, if you want.

15:13.718 --> 15:15.676
I know the partners
are extremely busy

15:15.759 --> 15:17.884
and on a tight schedule,
but I'm sure you also

15:17.967 --> 15:19.342
want to get
the ball rolling on this.

15:19.426 --> 15:21.134
Sure. I'll gather up the team.

15:33.634 --> 15:35.092
- ( alarm chirps )
- Whatcha doin'?

15:35.175 --> 15:37.217
I just killed
a fuckin' presentation.

15:37.301 --> 15:39.175
- What's up?
- I need a favor.

15:44.301 --> 15:46.259
You know
this is crazy, right?

15:46.342 --> 15:49.509
Girl, what is so crazy
about buying fake desserts
to bring to Andrew

15:49.593 --> 15:51.217
so I can see
if Nathan's home?

15:51.301 --> 15:53.551
( laughs )
It's, like, lowkey,

15:53.634 --> 15:55.426
it's weird that
you  think it's weird.

15:55.509 --> 15:57.134
You don't know
what you saying.

15:57.217 --> 15:58.467
Issa:
You don't know.

15:58.551 --> 16:01.009
You out here looking crazy
in pajamas.

16:01.092 --> 16:02.801
You got me lookin'
thirsty as fuck.

16:02.884 --> 16:04.467
I told you,
Andrew's canceled.

16:04.551 --> 16:06.593
It was a bad date.
That happens.

16:06.676 --> 16:09.092
- It's nobody's fault.
- It was his  fault.

16:09.175 --> 16:11.967
There is a thin line
between being honest
and being a dick,

16:12.050 --> 16:13.342
and he crossed it.

16:13.426 --> 16:14.843
Well, I promise
this won't take long.

16:14.925 --> 16:16.593
No-it-sure-the-fuck-won't.

16:16.676 --> 16:19.217
Look, I just want to know
what's goin' on.

16:19.301 --> 16:21.384
I wanna know why this nigga
ghosted on me.

16:21.467 --> 16:24.009
It's like, OK,
sometimes my kisses are weird,

16:24.092 --> 16:26.175
but my tongue likes
to do its own thing.

16:26.259 --> 16:28.509
You ain't gotta
Casper on me.

16:29.801 --> 16:31.509
( sighs )
You ready?

16:32.634 --> 16:34.759
Andrew, hey!

16:34.843 --> 16:36.301
Hey...

16:38.467 --> 16:40.426
We were just,
um, at Porto's--

16:40.509 --> 16:43.217
Which is in Burbank,
just like your house is, also,

16:43.301 --> 16:45.301
in Burbank.

16:45.384 --> 16:49.009
Right, and I said we should
bring you some desserts
as a peace offering.

16:49.092 --> 16:51.259
I hope we didn't
wake you guys up.

16:51.342 --> 16:53.384
At 6:00 p.m.? No.

16:54.426 --> 16:56.134
And I'm the only one here.

16:56.217 --> 16:58.217
Issa:
This Asian nigga lyin'.

16:58.301 --> 17:00.301
Well, in that case--

17:00.384 --> 17:01.801
I have to use the bathroom.

17:01.884 --> 17:04.050
Could I use your bathroom?

17:05.217 --> 17:07.718
Uh... sure.

17:11.801 --> 17:15.092
- Uh, there's a bathroom
just down here--
- Yeah, I see it. Thank you!

17:16.509 --> 17:18.342
- Uh...
- Molly: So!

17:18.426 --> 17:20.050
Porto's?

17:28.551 --> 17:31.301
Issa:
What if he's not in there?
Oh god, what if he  is  in there?

17:31.384 --> 17:33.175
Just go in!
He'll be happy to see you.

17:33.259 --> 17:34.967
Nuh-uh, bitch. What if
he's with someone else?

17:35.050 --> 17:36.342
He fuckin' better not be
with someone else.

17:36.426 --> 17:37.925
What if we just take a peek?

17:38.009 --> 17:39.301
Just a peeky-peek?

17:39.384 --> 17:40.843
Unless he is
with someone else.

17:40.925 --> 17:44.342
Then we gonna
murder him in the dick.

17:44.426 --> 17:46.843
( microwave beeping )

17:46.925 --> 17:48.342
Ohh.

17:48.426 --> 17:50.426
You have got to
get in on this.

17:50.509 --> 17:52.009
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm!

17:52.092 --> 17:53.342
It's so  good!

17:53.426 --> 17:55.967
OK, what are you
really doing here?

17:56.050 --> 17:59.301
'Cause you didn't
come all the way to Burbank
for a cheese roll.

17:59.384 --> 18:02.967
Um... you're right.

18:03.050 --> 18:06.759
Yeah, I came by to...
to talk.

18:09.634 --> 18:11.925
OK.

18:12.009 --> 18:14.217
You know, things got
really weird last night.

18:14.301 --> 18:17.384
You said some things,
I said some things,

18:17.467 --> 18:20.467
and, um, I forgive you.

18:23.134 --> 18:26.259
Yeah. Me making a bad joke
is pretty much the same thing

18:26.342 --> 18:28.050
as you leaving me alone
in a bar.

18:28.134 --> 18:30.134
Listen, you came at me
like we knew each other.

18:30.217 --> 18:32.259
You don't know me
well enough to say
some of the shit you did.

18:32.342 --> 18:35.259
Look, at Coachella
I meet one Molly,
back here I meet another.

18:35.342 --> 18:37.217
I don't know who
the real Molly is,

18:37.301 --> 18:39.634
but are they all
this fucked up?

18:43.134 --> 18:44.551
Issa:
Nathan messy.

18:44.634 --> 18:47.676
But, like,
is he  recently  messy?

18:54.467 --> 18:55.676
( sniffing )

18:55.759 --> 18:57.884
Yep. That's you.

18:59.884 --> 19:01.134
( sets bottle down )

19:02.384 --> 19:03.634
Mm.

19:03.718 --> 19:06.009
I wouldn't ever
open any drawers,

19:06.092 --> 19:07.843
but...

19:20.426 --> 19:22.843
So it did
mean something to you.

19:26.342 --> 19:27.801
( closes drawer )

19:29.509 --> 19:32.175
Nah, girl, we are not about
to go through his trash.

19:32.259 --> 19:33.301
( short laugh )

19:36.884 --> 19:39.217
Nah. Nope. Nope! Mnh-mnh.

19:39.301 --> 19:43.050
But, like, what if I could
guess his password?

19:43.134 --> 19:44.925
That'd be a sign.

19:47.384 --> 19:50.301
H-O-U-S-T-O-N.

19:50.384 --> 19:53.050
- ( rejection beep )
- Maybe that's a sign.

19:57.217 --> 19:59.050
Unless...

20:00.634 --> 20:02.759
I-S-S-A?

20:02.843 --> 20:03.718
Molly: Girl!

20:03.801 --> 20:05.175

20:30.092 --> 20:32.009
Issa:
Don't say too much.

20:32.092 --> 20:34.259
She might try to stop you
from sneakin' back in.

20:34.342 --> 20:36.426
I know your ass not thinkin'
about sneakin' back in there.

20:36.509 --> 20:37.509
No.

20:37.593 --> 20:39.759
Then you need to let this go.

20:39.843 --> 20:42.050
Issa, you up there hackin'
a nigga's laptop?

20:44.134 --> 20:45.843
Fuck Nathan.

20:45.925 --> 20:48.342
These niggas don't care
about nobody.

20:48.426 --> 20:52.551
They'll have you acting
all outside of yourself
if you let them.

20:53.843 --> 20:55.467
I don't know, I just...

20:55.551 --> 20:57.175
keep thinkin'
it's my fault.

20:57.259 --> 20:58.843
It's not your fault.
How is this your fault?

20:58.925 --> 21:00.551
'Cause I let him in.

21:00.634 --> 21:03.342
Maybe I shouldn't have been
so... honest.

21:03.426 --> 21:04.634
Maybe it scared him.

21:04.718 --> 21:08.259
If he gets scared off
because you were too real,

21:08.342 --> 21:10.676
then why you want him, girl?

21:14.884 --> 21:18.384
Girl, what is it about him?
Was the dick that  bomb?

21:18.467 --> 21:20.217
Issa: Yes.

21:20.301 --> 21:21.676
It wasn't about that.

21:24.342 --> 21:26.301
I mean...

21:27.801 --> 21:31.384
...he made me feel like
more than a fuck-up.

21:31.467 --> 21:34.426
You're not a fuck-up. Stop.

21:37.175 --> 21:41.342
I just don't know
if anybody's ever gonna
make me feel like that again.

21:45.050 --> 21:46.551
( sighs )

21:57.301 --> 21:58.843
This place is cute.

21:58.925 --> 22:00.426
I'm glad to see
some color.

22:00.509 --> 22:03.925
Yeah, I like the whole
neo-soul vibe he got goin'.

22:04.009 --> 22:05.342
He kinda look
like Maxwell daddy.

22:05.426 --> 22:08.092
Yeah, if you squint
like this...

22:08.175 --> 22:09.718
( both laugh )

22:09.801 --> 22:11.884
Oh, so, tell me for real.

22:11.967 --> 22:14.967
What'd you think
of the service?

22:15.050 --> 22:17.759
I liked what the pastor said
about having a higher purpose.

22:17.843 --> 22:20.384
I must have missed that.

22:20.467 --> 22:22.843
The metaphors
took me out of it.

22:22.925 --> 22:24.759
That's just how
he connects with
young people.

22:24.884 --> 22:27.175
Oh. I must not
be young enough.

22:27.259 --> 22:29.925
He a little corny,
but at the heart

22:30.009 --> 22:31.384
there's always
a real message.

22:31.467 --> 22:33.884
You can rewatch it
on his YouTube channel.

22:35.217 --> 22:37.509
- OK.
- When I first started,

22:37.593 --> 22:39.593
I was just going
through the motions,

22:39.676 --> 22:43.676
but once I got involved,
I felt more connected.

22:43.759 --> 22:45.634
And how long
did that take?

22:45.718 --> 22:47.718
Obviously it's different
for everybody.

22:47.801 --> 22:50.134
I started with Bible study
after my second week,

22:50.217 --> 22:52.217
then I joined
the Life Runners,

22:52.301 --> 22:54.884
and I just started volunteering
with the youth ministry
a few weeks ago.

22:54.967 --> 22:58.509
So... wow,
it's been like a year.

23:11.009 --> 23:12.843
Issa:
Ugh. Did I even sleep?

23:12.925 --> 23:15.175
I'm so fuckin' tired,
my head hurts.

23:15.259 --> 23:17.467
Was I crying?
I hate everything.

23:17.551 --> 23:20.134
You know what would
make you better.
Knowing where Nathan is.

23:20.217 --> 23:22.676
You could just drive by
a couple more times.

23:22.759 --> 23:25.217
If Molly hadn't stopped me,
I probably could have
gotten into his computer.

23:25.301 --> 23:27.342
I could go back and try.
Andrew leaves around 8:00.

23:27.426 --> 23:29.509
I think there was
a window open.
He found somebody better.

23:29.593 --> 23:30.967
He probably found somebody
better than you.

23:31.050 --> 23:32.342
Am I crazy?
Stop being crazy.

23:32.426 --> 23:34.384
You can stop. Move on.

25:52.718 --> 25:54.593
No, it's all good.

25:54.676 --> 25:55.884
Well, I just wanted
to thank you

25:55.967 --> 25:57.759
for telling me
about the workshop.

25:57.843 --> 25:59.217
Yeah,
was it helpful?

25:59.301 --> 26:00.718
Oh, yeah. I mean,

26:00.801 --> 26:03.843
I was listening
to someone tell me
what to do with my deck

26:03.925 --> 26:06.843
while trying
to finish my deck,
but it was great.

26:06.925 --> 26:08.384
( both laugh )

26:13.593 --> 26:15.092
So, what time are you off?

26:16.259 --> 26:18.551
That was actually
my last meeting.

26:20.801 --> 26:22.925
You have time for coffee?

26:26.884 --> 26:30.134
Iced green tea for me,
a long espresso for you.

26:30.217 --> 26:32.884
- You remember.
- I still don't know
what it is.

26:32.967 --> 26:34.384
( both laugh )

26:36.426 --> 26:39.217
Oh! Guess who I drove
in my Lyft the other day.

26:39.301 --> 26:40.551
- Who?
- I'll give you a hint.

26:40.634 --> 26:42.384
He said I need
a new "barbeurator."

26:42.467 --> 26:45.050
- Thug Yoda? For real?
- ( laughs ) Mm-hmm.

26:45.134 --> 26:47.301
He caught me up
on all the drama
at The Dunes.

26:47.384 --> 26:50.384
This white bitch tried
to move in with her parakeet,
Ms. Trudy killed her.

26:50.467 --> 26:53.509
- The white bitch?
- ( laughs ) No! The parakeet.

26:53.593 --> 26:57.092
- Oh, Ms. Trudy don't play.
She like it quiet.
- She does.

26:57.175 --> 26:59.551
Lowkey, I miss that place.

26:59.634 --> 27:01.259
Yeah, me, too.

27:02.801 --> 27:05.884
So, um, how's Lyft?

27:05.967 --> 27:08.509
- The money good?
- Oh, it's great.

27:12.217 --> 27:13.718
Honestly,

27:13.801 --> 27:15.843
it's really fuckin' hard.

27:15.925 --> 27:19.801
You know, after I moved out
the apartment, I was...

27:19.884 --> 27:22.551
stayin' on people's couches,

27:22.634 --> 27:24.967
and it was rough.

27:26.259 --> 27:28.301
Yeah. I get that.

27:32.301 --> 27:34.718
But at a certain point,
I was like...

27:34.801 --> 27:38.342
you can't keep letting
other people prop you up.

27:38.426 --> 27:41.342
Sometimes you gotta
do shit for yourself.

27:43.884 --> 27:45.509
That's real.

27:47.676 --> 27:50.092
You doin' the block party
by yourself?

27:50.175 --> 27:52.301
I mean, basically.

27:54.634 --> 27:56.426
I don't know
if it's gonna work,
'cause...

27:56.509 --> 27:59.134
'Cause you still gettin'
in your own head?

27:59.217 --> 28:00.342
I'm trying to change that.

28:00.426 --> 28:02.009
- Yeah.
- I am.

28:03.050 --> 28:05.634
Nah, I know what you mean.

28:05.718 --> 28:07.884
I'm trying to make
some changes, too.

28:09.718 --> 28:11.634
I went to church
the other day.

28:11.718 --> 28:14.342
What?!
You went to church?

28:16.175 --> 28:17.426
That's different.

28:17.509 --> 28:18.718
Yeah, it was a lot.

28:18.801 --> 28:21.676
Like, I don't know
if all of that is for me.

28:21.759 --> 28:24.217
This is just like
you and Safeway sushi,

28:24.301 --> 28:26.426
when you swore that
all sushi was trash.

28:26.509 --> 28:28.634
I was 27,
and nobody told me

28:28.718 --> 28:31.092
that I was eating
beginner-nigga sushi.

28:31.175 --> 28:32.801
( laughs )
My point is,

28:32.884 --> 28:34.301
there are other churches.

28:34.384 --> 28:36.342
So just try another one.

28:36.426 --> 28:37.384
A'ight, cool.

28:38.843 --> 28:41.509
I'm gonna find me a church
with some grown-up sushi.

28:41.593 --> 28:44.467
Or just try one
that's for you.

28:46.426 --> 28:47.884
'Cause that's what
I'm tryin' to do

28:47.967 --> 28:49.092
with this block party shit,

28:49.175 --> 28:50.925
just something for us,
by us.

28:51.009 --> 28:53.426
So, FUBU?

28:53.509 --> 28:54.593
No, I realized that

28:54.676 --> 28:56.342
soon as I said it.
Shut up.

28:56.426 --> 28:57.593
( both laugh )

28:57.676 --> 28:59.009
You gonna have L.L.
as your spokesman?

28:59.092 --> 29:00.342
- Think he would do it?

Welcome to this week's
Wine Down,  where we're joined

31:15.301 --> 31:19.092
by an awesome new cast member,
Mr. Kendrick Sampson,

31:19.551 --> 31:22.718
who plays Issa-slash-my-new-bae,
Nathan.

31:22.925 --> 31:26.217
Now, Issa and Nathan's
relationship seems promising

31:26.301 --> 31:29.009
in other episodes.
In this episode,

31:29.217 --> 31:31.301
you kinda become, like,
"Ghost Bae."

31:33.551 --> 31:35.801
You know,
there was a Lyft investigation

31:35.884 --> 31:37.718
going on,
maybe he got caught up.

31:37.801 --> 31:40.925
The Lyft secret police
done popped up at his door,

31:41.009 --> 31:43.009
-maybe he was-- No?
-(LAUGHS)

31:43.092 --> 31:46.801
-So Issa kinda went
over the edge this episode.
-Yes.

31:46.884 --> 31:49.009
Have you guys been guilty
of stalking at all?

31:49.092 --> 31:50.718
-What's the deal?
-One hundred percent.

31:50.801 --> 31:52.217
-One hundred percent?
-ISSA RAE: Wow!
-Yeah.

31:52.301 --> 31:55.384
-Thank you for admitting that.
-Popped up like, "Where you at?"

31:55.593 --> 31:56.593
-Why?
-KENDRICK SAMPSON:
"What you doin'?"

31:56.925 --> 31:58.134
-What triggered you?
-KENDRICK: Lookin' in windows.

31:58.217 --> 31:59.759
-Insecurity.
-Hmmm.

31:59.843 --> 32:01.676
I'm just like, you know,
"Where you at?"

32:01.759 --> 32:03.925
-"Why you not answering
my texts?" You know?
-Yeah.

32:04.217 --> 32:07.175
Kinda, you know, being ghosted
or like, figuring out if...

32:07.967 --> 32:10.718
-if she's on a date or--
-(EVERYONE LAUGHS)

32:10.801 --> 32:12.759
-"Whatchu doin'?" Or--
-ISSA: "What is it about me?"

32:12.843 --> 32:15.384
I remember my college girlfriend
broke up with me

32:15.467 --> 32:18.801
and I remember I found out
where she was, in Leimert Park,

32:19.217 --> 32:23.301
and I parked and I watched her
talk to a guy in Leimert Park.

32:23.384 --> 32:25.050
And I remember,
she called me later

32:25.134 --> 32:27.509
and was like, "I saw you
at Leimert Park watching me."

32:27.593 --> 32:29.759
-Oh my God!
-I was like, "That wasn't me!
That wasn't me! That wasn't me!"

32:29.843 --> 32:31.884
She was like, "I know
what your car looks like.

32:31.967 --> 32:33.759
It was clearly you watching me."

32:33.843 --> 32:35.009
"I don't know what you're
talking about, girl."

32:35.092 --> 32:36.342
'Cause you get it.
I was insecure.

32:36.426 --> 32:39.384
I just knew, like,
something was going on and--

32:39.467 --> 32:41.884
-I mean, justifiably,
you know, insecure.
-Justifiably.

32:41.967 --> 32:44.718
-Because when somebody just like
kinda disappears...
-PRENTICE PENNY: Yes!

32:44.801 --> 32:46.551
-You're like, "What's going on?
-PRENTICE: "What's going on?"

32:46.634 --> 32:47.509
like, I need to know."

32:47.718 --> 32:48.884
And you ask like,
"What is it about me?"

32:48.967 --> 32:50.384
I know, for me,
it's just been like,

32:50.467 --> 32:54.092
I want answers as to like,
who else you're checking for?

32:54.175 --> 32:56.050
'Cause I've been--
I've gone down wormholes,

32:56.134 --> 32:58.259
I've created fake accounts,
it's been crazy, but like,

32:58.342 --> 32:59.843
just finding out like,
"What is it about me

32:59.925 --> 33:02.593
that made this person disappear?
Why wasn't I enough?"

33:02.676 --> 33:05.175
And also answering the question
of just like...

33:05.634 --> 33:09.050
What are they--
How do they make me feel
and can I get it elsewhere?

33:09.134 --> 33:11.092
What do you feel like
Issa sees in Nathan?

33:11.342 --> 33:14.092
He's just like
a really dope human--

33:14.175 --> 33:16.384
I shouldn't have asked you that.
That's the wrong way...

33:16.676 --> 33:18.884
No, okay, look. Like for real,
for real, for real?

33:18.967 --> 33:21.925
They really clicked. I mean,
they had a vibe, they had--

33:22.009 --> 33:24.009
they understood
each other's humor

33:24.092 --> 33:25.593
and they had fun together

33:25.676 --> 33:27.009
and he kinda like
challenged her.

33:27.092 --> 33:28.759
The one thing that we liked
about Nathan was that

33:28.843 --> 33:31.259
it was the one guy
to finally come into Issa's life

33:31.342 --> 33:34.676
of Issa and Daniel, where Nathan
doesn't have any history

33:34.759 --> 33:38.134
with her, so Issa can kinda be
this new person,

33:38.217 --> 33:40.301
or this sort of fresh person
without any baggage.

33:40.384 --> 33:41.634
You know, with Lawrence,
there's baggage.

33:41.718 --> 33:44.050
With Daniel, there's some sort
of baggage of a past,

33:44.134 --> 33:46.259
and with Nathan, it's like
she's meeting him,

33:46.342 --> 33:48.175
they're both meeting each other
at this exact moment,

33:48.259 --> 33:49.967
at this exact time,
and there's no history

33:50.050 --> 33:51.843
and they can kinda create
a new history.

33:52.050 --> 33:54.634
I just want-- obviously ghosting
is like, you know,

33:54.718 --> 33:56.342
it's been around
since the beginning of time.

33:56.426 --> 33:58.050
-Cavemen were ghosting
on cave bitches.
-(LAUGHS)

33:58.384 --> 34:02.593
-So like, specifically,
this time is like, social media
-(EVERYONE LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY)

34:02.676 --> 34:04.676
will put you, will put
all your business out there

34:04.759 --> 34:06.967
and you can like,
opt to show where you are

34:07.050 --> 34:09.634
and I'm just wondering,
just given in this age,

34:09.718 --> 34:10.967
if it is socially acceptable
to be like,

34:11.050 --> 34:13.134
-"Oh, I saw your Facebook.
How's your kids?"
-Yeah.

34:13.217 --> 34:16.175
Or "I saw you got this new job.
What's going on?"

34:16.259 --> 34:19.426
But like,
is it socially acceptable to...

34:19.884 --> 34:23.259
track every person's move
if you're not causing them harm?

34:23.342 --> 34:25.009
Is it socially acceptable
to e-stalk?

34:25.092 --> 34:27.593
Yeah, I mean, if you put it out
on the internet, I mean,

34:27.676 --> 34:29.509
it's there for public--
especially if you've got

34:29.593 --> 34:31.009
somebody following you
and all that kind of stuff,

34:31.092 --> 34:34.551
but it gives you less an excuse,
less of an excuse to ghost.

34:34.925 --> 34:36.259
But is there an obligation?

34:36.342 --> 34:39.009
I do think social media
changes the way we communicate

34:39.092 --> 34:41.509
with each other. Like there's--
'cause again, like,

34:41.593 --> 34:42.843
human nature would either say,

34:42.925 --> 34:44.259
"You called me at my house,
I'm not there,"

34:44.467 --> 34:46.843
or you can text somebody
and say, "Hey, I got your text,

34:47.342 --> 34:49.092
but I'm busy doing,
I'm busy whatever,"

34:49.175 --> 34:52.384
but those social media things
sorta gives us the excuse

34:52.467 --> 34:56.009
to sorta like, kinda ghost even
social media-wise on people.

34:56.301 --> 34:59.384
Yeah, I don't think you owe
anybody any sort of text back

34:59.467 --> 35:00.925
or call back or anything like--

35:01.009 --> 35:03.009
Sometimes you wanna go
to the bathroom, you know,

35:03.092 --> 35:05.676
sometimes you just wanna chill,
sometimes you take a drink,

35:05.759 --> 35:07.884
whatever, and you don't owe them
the response.

35:07.967 --> 35:11.509
But on the other side, when you
are sending somebody something

35:11.593 --> 35:14.050
and they're not responding,
you're that much more anxious,

35:14.134 --> 35:16.759
just because, you're like,
"Oh, you're on social media,"

35:16.843 --> 35:19.384
so it just creates more
of a culture of anxiety

35:19.467 --> 35:20.676
around communication.

35:20.759 --> 35:23.217
It's definitely stopped me
from doing what I'm supposed

35:23.301 --> 35:26.009
to do and that's what we see
in this episode just with Issa,

35:26.092 --> 35:27.593
and you know,
she has this grand idea

35:27.676 --> 35:30.301
to do this block party,
which she reveals to Molly later

35:30.384 --> 35:32.634
that Nathan was sort of
the inspiration of her feeling

35:32.718 --> 35:35.384
like she could it,
but is also procrastinating

35:35.467 --> 35:37.759
later on, to find out what
his whereabouts are,

35:37.843 --> 35:39.801
and you know, to stalk him.
She's like-- it's impeding her

35:39.884 --> 35:43.217
-from doing what it is she feels
like she's supposed to be doing,
-PRENTICE: Right.

35:43.301 --> 35:47.259
and her trying to kinda use
that as an excuse of just like,

35:47.342 --> 35:49.925
"I need this person in my life.
I need a response.

35:50.009 --> 35:54.551
And if I don't have it,
then can I-- can I function?

35:54.634 --> 35:58.884
Am I worthy enough to even do
this task, that I need him

35:58.967 --> 36:00.925
to be able to do this
in the first place?"

36:01.301 --> 36:02.801
Everybody,
thanks for wine-ing down

36:02.884 --> 36:05.801
with us this week.
May you be free of ghosts

36:05.884 --> 36:09.509
and stalkers alike. Bye.

36:09.801 --> 36:11.259
(EVERYONE LAUGHS)

36:11.342 --> 36:13.342
-Bye-- Oh, it's both.
-Nah, it's me.

36:13.426 --> 36:15.134
Cheers. Cheers, cheers, cheers,
cheers, cheers, cheers.

36:15.217 --> 36:18.509
-Not you though.
-Yep, you ghosted him.
-You know what?
