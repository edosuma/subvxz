something appalling</i>

00:36.171 --> 00:40.007

00:40.008 --> 00:41.968
<i>Nothing for kings</i>

<i>Nothing for crowns</i>

00:44.054 --> 00:48.057
<i>Bring on the lovers,
liars and clowns</i>

00:48.058 --> 00:52.019
<i>Old situations, new complications</i>

00:52.020 --> 00:55.898

01:22.384 --> 01:26.929
<i>Weighty affairs will
just have to wait</i>

01:27.848 --> 01:33.269
Our principal characters live...
on this street,

01:33.270 --> 01:38.232
in a less fashionable suburb of
Rome, in these three houses.

01:38.233 --> 01:41.819
First, the house of Erronius,
a befuddled old man,

01:41.820 --> 01:46.032
abroad now in search of his children,
stolen in infancy by pirates.

01:46.033 --> 01:50.036
<i>Something erratic,
something dramatic</i>

01:50.037 --> 01:54.040
<i>Something for everyone:
a comedy tonight</i>

01:54.041 --> 01:59.462
Second, the house of Lycus, a buyer and
seller of the flesh of beautiful women.

01:59.463 --> 02:02.632
That's for those of you who
have no interest in pirates.

02:02.633 --> 02:04.717
Something for everyone.

02:04.718 --> 02:06.761
<i>A comedy tonight</i>

02:06.762 --> 02:11.808
And, finally, the house of Senex,
who lives here with his wife and son.

02:11.809 --> 02:14.936
Also in this house dwells
Pseudolus, slave to his son.

02:14.937 --> 02:17.855
Pseudolus is my favourite
character in the piece...

02:17.856 --> 02:20.233
a role of enormous
variety and nuance,

02:20.234 --> 02:24.570
and played by an actor of such versatility,
such magnificent range, such...

02:24.571 --> 02:28.072
Let me put it this way...
I play the part.

02:28.158 --> 02:31.911
<i>Something familiar,
something peculiar</i>

02:31.912 --> 02:35.665
<i>Something for everyone:
a comedy tonight</i>

02:35.666 --> 02:39.418
<i>Something that's gaudy,
something that's bawdy</i>

02:39.419 --> 02:43.214
<i>Something for everybody's taste</i>

02:43.215 --> 02:45.049
<i>Pantaloons and tunics</i>

02:45.050 --> 02:46.926
<i>Courtesans and eunuchs</i>

02:46.927 --> 02:48.803
<i>Funerals and chases</i>

02:48.804 --> 02:50.721
<i>Baritones and basses</i>

02:50.722 --> 02:52.348
<i>- Panderers
- Philanderers</i>

02:52.349 --> 02:54.183
<i>- Cupidity
- Timidity</i>

02:54.184 --> 02:55.351
<i>- Mistakes
- Fakes</i>

02:55.352 --> 02:56.227
<i>- Rhymes
- Mimes</i>

02:56.228 --> 02:58.229
<i>Tumblers, grumblers,
fumblers, bumblers</i>

02:58.230 --> 03:01.566
<i>No royal curse, no Trojan Horse</i>

03:01.567 --> 03:05.653
<i>And there's a happy
ending of course</i>

03:05.654 --> 03:07.655
<i>Goodness and badness</i>

03:07.656 --> 03:09.449
<i>Man in his madness</i>

03:09.450 --> 03:13.161
<i>This time it all
turns out all right</i>

03:13.162 --> 03:15.037
<i>Tragedy tomorrow</i>

03:15.038 --> 03:18.499
<i>Comedy, comedy, comedy, comedy,
comedy, comedy, comedy, comedy</i>

03:18.500 --> 03:24.374
<i>Comedy tonight</i>

03:28.218 --> 03:30.592
Hup! Hie!

03:31.263 --> 03:34.640
You, boy. Why are we
stopping? Hurry up.

03:34.641 --> 03:37.477
My dear and noble
neighbours, my apologies.

03:37.478 --> 03:42.356
Since moving in next door I've been
remiss in not calling to pay my respects.

03:42.357 --> 03:45.693
However, it is our inaugural week,
and you know what that is.

03:45.694 --> 03:49.314
I certainly do not. Move on.

03:50.199 --> 03:53.450
All right, don't stand.
Move. Move! Hup.

03:54.578 --> 03:58.122
A common flesh pedlar in the
house next to ours. Disgusting!

03:58.123 --> 04:01.793
Disgraceful. All that revolting
flesh, just next door.

04:01.794 --> 04:05.004
- Make way for the house of Senex.
- Senex, wait.

04:05.005 --> 04:06.214
Wait.

04:06.215 --> 04:09.550
Is this not Pseudolus, your slave?
He was parading as a citizen.

04:09.551 --> 04:15.807
Believe me, mistress, I was not parading.
I was walking humbly like a slave.

04:15.808 --> 04:19.310
He invited us to game with him.
He cheated us out of nine minae.

04:19.310 --> 04:22.188
- Nine? I took seven.
- Return nine.

04:22.189 --> 04:26.442
One. Two. Three. Four. I'm being
cheated out of the money I won fairly.

04:26.443 --> 04:29.320
- Pseudolus.
- Seven. Eight.

04:29.321 --> 04:32.240
- Where's five and six?
- I'm coming to them. Nine. Five. Six.

04:32.241 --> 04:35.409
Thank you, citizens.
Do not fear, he will be punished.

04:35.410 --> 04:37.950
- Farewell.
- Farewell.

04:39.665 --> 04:42.458
- Now...
- I know, I should be whipped.

04:42.459 --> 04:46.087
Gently. However, my intentions
were of the noblest.

04:46.088 --> 04:49.132
Hearing that you were
visiting your dear mother,

04:49.133 --> 04:54.345
I wanted to purchase a remembrance...
some bath essence, a new spear.

04:54.346 --> 04:56.556
Fifty more lashes for lying.

04:56.557 --> 05:00.685
You were doing what you always do...
seeking money to buy your freedom.

05:00.686 --> 05:04.272
Freedom? Oh, madam, who would
want to be free of you?

05:04.273 --> 05:05.982
Who indeed?

05:05.983 --> 05:08.943
- Hysterium?
- My mistress calls.

05:08.944 --> 05:12.780
Slave-in-chief, drag this man home
and beat him without mercy.

05:12.781 --> 05:15.616
- I shall be brutal.
- Good. Up.

05:15.617 --> 05:21.164
We go to buy a breeder slave. Attend
to him, Hysterium, my slave of slaves.

05:21.165 --> 05:26.335
I live to grovel. I shall lash him to pulp.
I shall wear out eight whips.

05:26.336 --> 05:30.419
Strong men will blanch.
My arm will...

05:32.509 --> 05:36.971
Come along. They're all from
Gaul and they're all from Egypt.

05:36.972 --> 05:39.098
You, sir... and you.

05:39.099 --> 05:44.437
Come along now, gents. They're all
fresh in today. Don't waste my time.

05:44.438 --> 05:49.692
No? Try Fertilla the Populator.
300 pounds of fertile flesh.

05:49.693 --> 05:56.777
Has produced 18 healthy little slaves,
and is capable of producing 18 more.

05:58.118 --> 06:01.156
You won't regret it.

06:09.296 --> 06:10.588
Oh!

06:10.589 --> 06:14.173
It is time we were gone. Senex?

06:16.011 --> 06:18.179
Hysterium?

06:18.180 --> 06:24.769
Ah, here you are. And there I am. A gift for
my mother on the anniversary of her birth.

06:24.770 --> 06:27.438
104 and not an organ
in working condition.

06:27.439 --> 06:30.650
- Will it please her?
- The craftsmanship is superb.

06:30.651 --> 06:32.860
- And the likeness?
- Frightening.

06:32.861 --> 06:33.986
We go.

06:33.987 --> 06:38.574
Hysterium, here are my husband's final
instructions. Watch over our son Hero.

06:38.575 --> 06:42.620
Keep him cheerful, well fed and
far from the opposite sex.

06:42.621 --> 06:44.330
He must learn sometime.

06:44.331 --> 06:47.917
When that time comes, you shall
teach him... what little you know.

06:47.918 --> 06:53.506
Above all, do not let his eyes stray to that
house next door. I hold you responsible.

06:53.507 --> 06:57.135
- Rather than let you down, I would die.
- That is what I had in mind.

06:57.136 --> 06:59.137
- Furthermore...
- We are on our way.

06:59.138 --> 07:04.100
- We are on our way.
- Come, Senex. Carry my bust with pride.

07:04.101 --> 07:09.147
Yes, dear. A lesson to remember:
never fall in love during a total eclipse.

07:09.148 --> 07:10.893
Thank you, sir.

07:11.400 --> 07:15.653
- Where is Hero?
- He's in his room, studying with his tutor.

07:15.654 --> 07:22.702
"The sun and the moon revolve around
the Earth, as do the four planets."

07:22.703 --> 07:29.125
"Above all there is a great blue bowl,
which is the sky. There are many stars..."

07:29.126 --> 07:34.172
"..capable of much pleasure, among
which the brushing of a flower..."

07:34.173 --> 07:38.885
"Many stars have been named
by the Egyptian astronomers,

07:38.886 --> 07:44.098
but we have developed our modern
system of astronomy from the Greeks."

07:44.099 --> 07:47.933
Who, as you know,
were very poor scholars.

07:48.812 --> 07:52.857
"The Earth is a flat platform
of ground that meets..."

07:52.858 --> 07:58.518
Take this message of my love to
she who has captured my heart.

08:05.496 --> 08:08.164
That breeder woman, has she
been thrown a mate yet?

08:08.165 --> 08:12.293
Alas, she refuses just any slave.
She demands to choose.

08:12.294 --> 08:16.297
Choose? She'll breed and like it,
like everyone else. Almost everyone.

08:16.298 --> 08:20.802
We caught your runaway slave. Now he
dare challenge our right to execute him.

08:20.803 --> 08:25.556
I'm a family slave. What's the good of
that if you're executed by strangers?

08:25.557 --> 08:29.477
- He is correct. We shall torture him.
- See how they look after their own?

08:29.478 --> 08:33.272
Hold your tongue.
Thank you, Officer.

08:33.273 --> 08:37.777
Now, what can we devise?
Something suitable and lingering.

08:37.778 --> 08:39.611
- May I suggest...?
- You may not.

08:39.613 --> 08:42.073
- Hang him.
- Hanging is too good for him.

08:42.073 --> 08:44.283
- Much too good.
- By the feet?

08:44.284 --> 08:45.952
That doesn't hurt much.

08:45.953 --> 08:49.539
Hanging by the feet while
being lashed. They hate that.

08:49.540 --> 08:54.460
They should hate that. If I suggest
that we try to find some other method,

08:54.461 --> 08:58.589
it is only because I happen to be
completely impervious to physical pain,

08:58.590 --> 09:02.424
and I can't stand the thought
of spoiling your pleasure.

09:05.097 --> 09:08.933
- I thought you were impervious to pain.
- Not my own.

09:08.934 --> 09:10.476
Ah!

09:10.477 --> 09:12.562
- You like him?
- I like him.

09:12.563 --> 09:15.982
Have him. Congratulations,
your life has been spared.

09:15.983 --> 09:19.110
May it be long, healthy
and productive.

09:19.111 --> 09:21.696
Productive as a breeder?

09:21.697 --> 09:23.030
Hang me.

09:23.031 --> 09:25.992
This is your house. Come, come.

09:25.993 --> 09:28.703
Well, visit at any
time, dear neighbour.

09:28.704 --> 09:32.248
No obligation to buy,
just come in and browse.

09:32.249 --> 09:36.043
Senex! Come away from
that house of shame.

09:36.044 --> 09:40.210
I was only just standing here
and saying "Shame, shame."

09:41.967 --> 09:45.918
For your own good,
Hysterium, look after Hero.

10:01.904 --> 10:04.112
Shh!

10:09.203 --> 10:13.164
- What brings you up here?
- I was trying to get in...

10:13.165 --> 10:17.460
In there? You must never know
what goes on in that house.

10:17.461 --> 10:21.828
- But I do know.
- You do? Isn't it amazing?

10:22.716 --> 10:25.927
- Pseudolus, I'm in love!
- Well, that's very...

10:25.928 --> 10:29.472
In love? You? Who is she?

10:29.473 --> 10:32.141
Sometimes you can see
her in that window.

10:32.142 --> 10:35.228
A common courtesan in
the house of Lycus?

10:35.229 --> 10:39.023
- Is that disgraceful?
- It doesn't sound like an achievement.

10:39.024 --> 10:42.527
I don't care. I will give
anything for her. Anything.

10:42.528 --> 10:45.154
- You really love that girl?
- Oh!

10:45.155 --> 10:47.115
I like the way you said that.

10:47.116 --> 10:51.410
Master Hero, you cannot buy her... at
your age you're not allowed to buy her...

10:51.411 --> 10:56.374
but suppose someone with tremendous
cunning could arrange for her to be yours.

10:56.375 --> 10:57.083
Yes.

10:57.084 --> 11:01.045
If that someone could arrange
it, what would you give me?

11:01.046 --> 11:02.922
I will give you everything I own.

11:02.923 --> 11:07.343
But what do you own? 20 minae,
a collection of seashells... and me.

11:07.344 --> 11:08.261
Yes.

11:08.262 --> 11:12.974
Forget about the minae and the
seashells. Just give me me.

11:12.975 --> 11:16.310
- Give you you?
- My freedom.

11:16.311 --> 11:19.772
Pseudolus, people do not go
around freeing slaves every day.

11:19.773 --> 11:23.192
Be the first, start a fashion.

11:23.193 --> 11:26.979
- Get me that girl.
- And if I do?

11:27.406 --> 11:30.575
- You are free.
- I am what?

11:31.743 --> 11:35.244
- Free.
- Free!

11:49.136 --> 11:52.013
If I've told you once I've
told you a hundred times,

11:52.014 --> 11:54.390
do not fan the girls
when they're wet!

11:54.391 --> 11:58.675
But you'll never learn.
You'll be a eunuch all your life.

12:14.661 --> 12:18.032
Oh! You bitch!

12:22.586 --> 12:26.170
I know that sound. And I love it.

12:26.507 --> 12:30.176
Ugh! You. How did you
come into money?

12:30.177 --> 12:31.969
An unexpected legacy.

12:31.970 --> 12:36.849
My uncle Simo, the Carthaginian elephant
breeder, came to an untimely end.

12:36.850 --> 12:40.186
He was crushed to death on the
last day of the mating season.

12:40.187 --> 12:44.774
- This morning I bought my freedom.
- Congratulations... citizen.

12:44.775 --> 12:48.069
With this much left over
for one gross indulgence.

12:48.070 --> 12:51.614
Lycus, I am in the market
for a lifetime companion.

12:51.615 --> 12:58.162
I say in all modesty, I have an assortment
of beauty second to none, and... Who?

12:58.163 --> 13:01.749
My former young master.
Thought I'd further his education.

13:01.750 --> 13:05.253
He's bored with picture books.
You understand?

13:05.254 --> 13:10.383
Who better than I?
Come in, little boy, won't you?

13:10.384 --> 13:13.754
Eunuchs, quickly. A buyer!

13:23.439 --> 13:25.481
Was 1 a good year?

13:25.482 --> 13:29.485
Now, for your approval and possible
purchase, from out of the East,

13:29.486 --> 13:33.948
with the face of an idol, the arms of
a willow tree, the pelvis of a camel:

13:33.949 --> 13:36.525
Tintinabula.

14:18.035 --> 14:19.994
Was this the one?

14:19.995 --> 14:21.579
No.

14:21.580 --> 14:24.624
Don't you have anyone
in there a bit less noisy?

14:24.625 --> 14:26.542
I have.

14:26.543 --> 14:31.172
Vibrata. A desert bloom of indescribable
beauty. Lithe as a tigress.

14:31.173 --> 14:34.759
Wondrous as a flamingo. For he
whose interest is the wildlife.

14:34.760 --> 14:37.299
Thank you.

15:19.888 --> 15:21.973
- No.
- Uh!

15:21.974 --> 15:26.561
Frankly, I was hoping to live past my
wedding night. She seems a bit too...

15:26.562 --> 15:28.771
No matter. I understand.

15:28.772 --> 15:31.691
Consider the Gemini:
a matched pair.

15:31.692 --> 15:34.986
Look at them... either one a
divinely assembled woman,

15:34.987 --> 15:41.240
together, an infinite number
of mathematical possibilities.

16:00.971 --> 16:03.222
No.

16:03.223 --> 16:07.435
I'm a man of limited means, and I don't
suppose you'd want to break up a set.

16:07.436 --> 16:09.729
I couldn't. You do understand?

16:09.730 --> 16:12.732
Completely. Do go on.

16:12.733 --> 16:17.278
And on, and on, and
on, and on, and on.

16:17.279 --> 16:22.033
Enough! I know what you want.
Behold Panacea.

16:22.034 --> 16:25.036
Panacea, whose face holds
a thousand promises,

16:25.037 --> 16:28.407
and a body that stands
behind each promise.

16:50.354 --> 16:52.893
No.

17:08.622 --> 17:12.834
Don't misunderstand... it's the proportions.
I love the breadth, it's the length.

17:12.835 --> 17:17.130
She may be the right length, but is
she right for me? You see what I mean?

17:17.131 --> 17:20.508
- Isn't she a bit too short?
- Definitely not.

17:20.509 --> 17:23.511
- Too tall?
- That's where you're perfect together.

17:23.512 --> 17:27.390
Yes, but how often will we find
ourselves in this position?

17:27.391 --> 17:30.435
No need to compromise.

17:30.436 --> 17:34.684
My final offering: Gymnasia,
the silent woman.

17:34.773 --> 17:40.149
A giant stage upon which a
thousand dramas may be played.

17:53.250 --> 17:54.917
You can speak with her?

17:54.918 --> 17:59.796
Whilst a child I had a nurse
from the Isle of Silent Women.

17:59.840 --> 18:03.259
- May I have my foot back?
- You poor child.

18:03.260 --> 18:04.886
- Pseudolus!
- Yes, darling?

18:04.887 --> 18:07.430
Do you want your freedom?

18:07.431 --> 18:10.892
- More than ever. I'll take her.
- That's not the one.

18:10.893 --> 18:14.562
But yours isn't here. It's not
nice to walk out without buying...

18:14.563 --> 18:16.147
I want my...

18:16.148 --> 18:19.275
If you must squabble, do it
in a place of less character.

18:19.276 --> 18:21.652
I know your type: shoppers.

18:21.653 --> 18:24.989
Please don't touch the merchandise.
It shows every mark.

18:24.990 --> 18:28.826
Courtesans, back to your quarters.
I'll be back for noonday prayers.

18:28.827 --> 18:32.955
Move. Do you mind? Out! Please,
quickly, out. Both of you, go.

18:32.956 --> 18:36.209
- Quickly, out. Out.
- There she is!

18:36.210 --> 18:41.339
One moment. Did I not just spy a golden
head with sky-blue eyes on yon balcony?

18:41.340 --> 18:44.383
Oh, that one. A recent arrival
from Crete. A virgin.

18:44.384 --> 18:47.345
- A virgin.
- Is that good?

18:47.346 --> 18:50.181
- Only today she was sold.
- Sold?

18:50.182 --> 18:53.766
Then receive, O bosom,
thy fatal blade.

18:54.269 --> 18:57.897
Behave yourself. She was sold?

18:57.898 --> 19:01.526
Yes. To the agents of a Roman captain.
He claims her this very day.

19:01.527 --> 19:03.903
- Today!
- She cost 500 minae.

19:03.904 --> 19:07.406
- Then receive, O bosom, thy...
- Put your bosom away.

19:07.407 --> 19:10.076
- You say she just arrived from Crete?
- Yes.

19:10.077 --> 19:14.372
I hope the captain is kind to her.
She deserves a bit of affection before...

19:14.373 --> 19:18.459
- Tragic, is it not?
- What? What's tragic?

19:18.460 --> 19:20.545
- The news from Crete.
- What news?

19:20.546 --> 19:23.589
Why should I darken your day?
Farewell, Lycus.

19:23.590 --> 19:25.550
- What is the news?
- What news?

19:25.551 --> 19:28.553
- The news from Crete?
- You force me to tell you.

19:28.554 --> 19:32.723
Crete is being ravaged by a plague.
People are dying by the thousands.

19:32.724 --> 19:35.601
This girl is healthy.
She smiles through the day.

19:35.602 --> 19:38.688
I thought you knew... when
they smile, the end is near.

19:38.689 --> 19:39.772
- No.
- Yes.

19:39.773 --> 19:43.985
I'm told it is lovely now in Crete...
everyone lying there, smiling.

19:43.986 --> 19:46.154
Is it... is it contagious?

19:46.155 --> 19:49.991
- You ever see a plague that wasn't?
- What about my other girls?

19:49.992 --> 19:51.951
You'd best get her out of here.

19:51.952 --> 19:55.997
- Yes. But where? How?
- I'll take her before the captain arrives.

19:55.998 --> 20:00.168
Capital! I'll go fetch her.
Why should you risk...?

20:00.169 --> 20:04.922
Because I've already had the plague.
I would tell you all about it, but...

20:04.923 --> 20:07.961
No. I'll go fetch her.
Don't go away.

20:08.177 --> 20:10.636
Pseudolus, I'm to be with her!

20:10.637 --> 20:14.015
- Until the captain arrives this forenoon.
- Yes.

20:14.016 --> 20:15.391
- Wait.
- Yes?

20:15.392 --> 20:17.351
- A brilliant idea.
- Yes!

20:17.352 --> 20:19.520
That's what we need,
a brilliant idea.

20:19.521 --> 20:23.941
Go, go! Get a move on. No, don't
touch that pillar. Go, go.

20:23.942 --> 20:27.609
Mind your breathing...
just inhale. Go, go.

20:28.197 --> 20:31.282
Pseudolus, how kind you are.
I shall not forget this.

20:31.283 --> 20:35.536
Someday I shall repay you, for
you, Pseudolus, are a true friend.

20:35.537 --> 20:40.165
And you, Lycus, are a
gentleman and a procurer.

20:46.340 --> 20:48.667
Psst!

20:49.384 --> 20:53.471
To the garden, and break the news that
you're gonna run away to marry her.

20:53.472 --> 20:57.350
- Won't I catch the plague?
- There is no plague. We made that up.

20:57.351 --> 20:59.227
- Clever of us.
- Wasn't it?

20:59.228 --> 21:02.772
I'll hie myself to the harbour to hire
a boat. Hoe you to the garden.

21:02.773 --> 21:06.943
You hie... and I'll hoe.

21:06.944 --> 21:09.483
Good luck.

21:19.164 --> 21:22.749
- My name is Hero.
- My name is Philia.

21:28.048 --> 21:31.884
- I've often seen you.
- I've often seen you, too.

21:31.885 --> 21:37.682
I've watched you undressing at night.
Only from the waist up. It's a high window.

21:37.683 --> 21:39.767
You have beautiful legs.

21:39.768 --> 21:41.894
What?

21:41.895 --> 21:43.020
Oh.

21:43.021 --> 21:45.148
You do, too.

21:45.149 --> 21:47.233
I imagine, I mean.

21:47.234 --> 21:50.319
I would show them to
you, but they're sold.

21:50.320 --> 21:54.073
I cost 500 minae. Is
that a lot of money?

21:54.074 --> 21:56.659
- Yes.
- More than 300?

21:56.660 --> 22:01.456
- Nearly twice as much.
- Three and five, they always mix me up.

22:01.457 --> 22:04.417
I hope the captain doesn't
expect me to do adding.

22:04.418 --> 22:06.461
You can't add?

22:06.462 --> 22:12.925
We're taught charm and grace, and no
more. I cannot add or spell or anything.

22:12.926 --> 22:15.094
I have but one talent.

22:15.095 --> 22:18.681
<i>I'm lovely</i>

22:18.682 --> 22:22.602
<i>All I am is lovely</i>

22:22.603 --> 22:29.817
<i>Lovely is the one thing I can do</i>

22:31.487 --> 22:34.322
<i>Winsome</i>

22:34.323 --> 22:38.159
<i>What I am is winsome</i>

22:38.160 --> 22:45.374
<i>Radiant as in some dream come true</i>

22:46.877 --> 22:49.587
<i>Oh</i>

22:49.588 --> 22:53.466
<i>Isn't it a shame?</i>

22:53.467 --> 22:57.011
<i>I can neither sew nor cook</i>

22:57.012 --> 23:03.226
<i>Nor read nor write my name</i>

23:03.227 --> 23:07.605
<i>But I'm happy</i>

23:07.606 --> 23:11.526
<i>Merely being lovely</i>

23:11.527 --> 23:19.691
<i>For it's one thing
I can give to you</i>

23:21.954 --> 23:24.530
Philia, say my name.

23:24.623 --> 23:26.999
- Just say your name?
- Yes.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.540
Very well, then.

23:30.254 --> 23:32.255
I've forgotten it.

23:32.256 --> 23:33.798
It's Hero.

23:33.799 --> 23:38.511
Forgive me, Hero.
I've no memory for names.

23:38.512 --> 23:42.463
You don't need one.
You don't need anything.

23:44.518 --> 23:48.312
<i>You're lovely</i>

23:48.313 --> 23:52.024
<i>Absolutely lovely</i>

23:52.025 --> 23:58.694
<i>Who'd believe the
loveliness of you?</i>

24:00.451 --> 24:02.994
<i>Winsome</i>

24:02.995 --> 24:06.831
<i>Sweet and warm and winsome</i>

24:06.832 --> 24:14.046
<i>Radiant as in some dream come true</i>

24:15.174 --> 24:21.637
<i>Now Venus would seem tame</i>

24:21.638 --> 24:29.019
<i>Helen and her thousand ships
would have to die of shame</i>

24:30.272 --> 24:34.984
<i>And I'm happy</i>

24:34.985 --> 24:38.946
<i>- Happy that I'm lovely
- Happy that you're lovely</i>

24:38.947 --> 24:47.622
<i>For there's one thing
loveliness can do</i>

24:47.623 --> 24:55.087
<i>It's a gift for me to share</i>

24:55.088 --> 24:59.171
<i>With you</i>

25:05.098 --> 25:07.016
Psst! Psst!

25:07.017 --> 25:10.851
Master Hero, put that down.

25:11.563 --> 25:13.356
Hysterium, this is Philia.

25:13.357 --> 25:18.736
Never mind who she is, who is she?
Where did you find her?

25:18.737 --> 25:21.823
- In the house of Lycus.
- A courtesan? No!

25:21.824 --> 25:24.784
- I am a virgin.
- Of course.

25:24.785 --> 25:29.664
Master Hero, bid farewell to this person
so that she can go about her... business.

25:29.665 --> 25:34.001
- No, no, no. Pseudolus said...
- Pseudolus? I might have known it!

25:34.002 --> 25:37.421
A passage to Thessaly
for two at the first tide.

25:37.422 --> 25:42.051
- In one hour.
- Good. Now, care to play for the boat?

25:46.974 --> 25:50.935
How dare you! Arranging an assignation
between a boy and a you-know-what!

25:50.936 --> 25:53.980
There's something about that
you-know-what you know not.

25:53.981 --> 25:57.358
- What do I know not?
- That girl is my daughter.

25:57.359 --> 25:59.444
- Your what?
- You've heard me speak of her.

25:59.445 --> 26:03.197
- Never. That girl is not your daughter.
- My sister?

26:03.198 --> 26:05.575
- I go tell his parents.
- Wait!

26:05.576 --> 26:10.079
He insisted on meeting her, but she was
sold to a captain who claims her today.

26:10.080 --> 26:11.831
What can happen in an hour?

26:11.832 --> 26:14.709
At his age? The mind boggles.
I go tell his parents.

26:14.710 --> 26:17.378
- I go with you.
- You wait till I tell them about you.

26:17.379 --> 26:20.047
No. You wait till I
tell them about you.

26:20.048 --> 26:23.050
Tell them what about me?
I am a pillar of virtue.

26:23.051 --> 26:26.846
It may be of interest that their pillar
of virtue, their slave-in-chief,

26:26.847 --> 26:33.385
has secreted in his cubicle Rome's most
extensive collection of erotic pottery.

26:33.645 --> 26:39.442
When did you acquire that large fruit
bowl with the frieze of the...?

26:39.443 --> 26:40.610
Pseudolus...

26:40.611 --> 26:44.280
- Neither of us is perfect.
- If it is only for an hour or so.

26:44.281 --> 26:50.985
Where's the harm? Especially with the
master and mistress safely out of the way.

26:57.586 --> 27:02.048
I'm worried about Hero. Perhaps I should
go back and keep a fatherly eye...

27:02.049 --> 27:04.376
Senex!

27:09.473 --> 27:12.266
- Stop!
- Whoa!

27:12.267 --> 27:14.894
- I saw that.
- I was stung by a bee.

27:14.895 --> 27:18.022
- Oh, my nose!
- We shall have to have it resharpened.

27:18.023 --> 27:19.148
Here?

27:19.149 --> 27:24.362
I suppose I could hasten back to the
stonecutter and join you tomorrow mor...

27:24.363 --> 27:27.365
No. The trip would tire me.
I should be exhausted.

27:27.366 --> 27:30.493
You shall go back,
you selfish toad. Now.

27:30.494 --> 27:35.623
But, my love, I don't know how I shall
survive the long lonely night without you.

27:35.624 --> 27:39.208
You'll just have to force yourself.

27:45.759 --> 27:48.678
I've just been to the harbour.
We must hurry.

27:48.679 --> 27:51.097
- Are you going somewhere?
- No, but you are.

27:51.098 --> 27:53.637
I cannot go.

27:54.351 --> 27:56.602
Why can you not?

27:56.603 --> 28:00.773
While the captain has a contract, I must
go with him. I must honour my contract.

28:00.774 --> 28:04.569
An honest virgin.
What a terrible combination.

28:04.570 --> 28:08.573
Excuse me. We'll give her a
little knock on the head and...

28:08.574 --> 28:11.367
No, I will not use
force against her.

28:11.368 --> 28:14.787
Venus, why did you bring us
together only to part us?

28:14.788 --> 28:17.206
Be brave, Hero.

28:17.207 --> 28:19.917
For us, there will
never be happiness.

28:19.918 --> 28:24.922
Then we must learn to be happy without it.
When will the captain take me?

28:24.923 --> 28:28.468
In due time you will be
taken, but not in the garden.

28:28.469 --> 28:30.553
- Inside.
- How shall I know it's him?

28:30.554 --> 28:34.098
He will knock on the door three times.
Go on upstairs and wait.

28:34.099 --> 28:39.103
My mistress's bedroom, the green one.
Go, go. Up, up, up. Go, go, go. Master...

28:39.104 --> 28:42.689
Master, she will go
with you, I promise.

28:48.906 --> 28:50.782
She's gone. Good.

28:50.783 --> 28:57.487
Then I'll get you a nice plump peahen. We
must try to get your appetite back to food.

28:58.081 --> 29:00.792
- Our passport to freedom.
- What is it?

29:00.793 --> 29:05.379
I lifted Hysterium's book of potions. We'll
mix a sleeping potion in a beaker of wine.

29:05.380 --> 29:08.716
We'll give it to the girl to drink and
tell Lycus she died of the plague.

29:08.717 --> 29:11.219
You hie her to the boat.
I hie me to the hills... free!

29:11.220 --> 29:15.634
- Brilliant!
- Not brilliant, just... Well, yes, brilliant.

29:16.892 --> 29:19.519
I just remembered
something frightening.

29:19.520 --> 29:24.607
I cannot read. Find the sleeping potions,
quickly. The ingredients, quickly.

29:24.608 --> 29:26.275
- Eye of an eel.
- That we have.

29:26.276 --> 29:28.402
- Heart of a snail.
- That we have.

29:28.403 --> 29:32.031
- A cup of mare sweat.
- That we have not.

29:32.032 --> 29:35.618
Mare sweat. Where will we find
mare sweat on a day like this?

29:35.619 --> 29:38.621
Quick! You to the
north, I to the south.

29:38.622 --> 29:41.993
- This is exciting.
- Isn't it? Go!

29:48.298 --> 29:50.838
Follow me!

29:54.429 --> 29:56.637
- That way.
- Yes, yes.

30:10.821 --> 30:13.693
The green bedroom?
Knock three times?

30:17.369 --> 30:19.787
The captain.

30:19.788 --> 30:22.032
Take me. Take me.

30:22.791 --> 30:26.162
- I beg your pardon?
- Take me.

30:27.713 --> 30:30.252
Just a moment.

30:33.218 --> 30:35.720
Now, what did you say?

30:35.721 --> 30:40.516
Take me, my body is yours.
Is this not what you want?

30:40.517 --> 30:43.811
- It has crossed my mind.
- But you must know something.

30:43.812 --> 30:44.937
Yes?

30:44.938 --> 30:48.316
Though you may have my body,
you shall never have my heart.

30:48.317 --> 30:50.818
You can't have everything.

30:50.819 --> 30:55.780
A thousand thanks...
whichever one of you did this.

30:58.702 --> 31:02.747
Would you believe it? There was a mare
sweating not two streets from here.

31:02.748 --> 31:07.001
- Looks more like his father every day.
- Pseudolus, he's here.

31:07.002 --> 31:09.045
- No.
- Remember where we stopped.

31:09.046 --> 31:13.299
- Sir, you're back.
- She almost broke it. Who is she?

31:13.300 --> 31:16.677
You may well ask. "Who is she?"
you ask, as well you may.

31:16.678 --> 31:18.971
- Delightful.
- I await your bidding.

31:18.972 --> 31:21.390
- My bid...
- Ever your servant.

31:21.391 --> 31:25.311
- Ever my servant.
- That's it. Your servant. Your new maid.

31:25.312 --> 31:29.607
- New maid? She seems very loyal.
- Very courteous, efficient, thoughtful.

31:29.608 --> 31:34.521
Maids like me. I'm neat.
I like maids. They're neat.

31:36.824 --> 31:39.742
<i>Everybody ought to have a maid</i>

31:39.743 --> 31:42.578
<i>Everybody ought to
have a working girl</i>

31:42.579 --> 31:45.331
<i>Everybody ought to
have a lurking girl</i>

31:45.332 --> 31:48.417
<i>To potter around the house</i>

31:48.418 --> 31:51.379
<i>Everybody ought to have a maid</i>

31:51.380 --> 31:53.923
<i>Everybody ought to have a menial</i>

31:53.924 --> 31:57.176
<i>Consistently congenial</i>

31:57.177 --> 32:00.429
<i>And quieter than a mouse</i>

32:00.430 --> 32:03.516
<i>Oh, oh, wouldn't she be delicious</i>

32:03.517 --> 32:06.310
<i>Tidying up the
dishes, neat as a pin?</i>

32:06.311 --> 32:10.648
<i>Oh, oh, wouldn't she be
delightful, sweeping out?</i>

32:10.649 --> 32:12.066
<i>Sleeping in</i>

32:12.067 --> 32:14.819
<i>Everybody ought to have a maid</i>

32:14.820 --> 32:17.029
<i>Someone who when
fetching you your slipper</i>

32:17.030 --> 32:20.450
<i>Will be winsome as a whippoorwill</i>

32:20.451 --> 32:23.411
<i>And graceful as a grouse</i>

32:23.412 --> 32:26.456
<i>Fluttering up the stairways,
shuttering up the windows</i>

32:26.457 --> 32:29.292
<i>Cluttering up the bedroom,
buttering up the master</i>

32:29.293 --> 32:33.625
<i>Puttering all around the house</i>

32:35.174 --> 32:36.799
<i>- A maid?
- A maid.</i>

32:36.800 --> 32:38.092
<i>- A maid?
- A maid.</i>

32:38.093 --> 32:40.636
<i>Everybody ought to have a maid</i>

32:40.637 --> 32:43.598
<i>Everybody ought to
have a serving girl</i>

32:43.599 --> 32:46.559
<i>A loyal and unswerving girl</i>

32:46.560 --> 32:49.598
<i>Who's quieter than a mouse</i>

32:50.314 --> 32:53.107
<i>Oh, oh, think of
her at the dustbin</i>

32:53.108 --> 32:56.027
<i>'Specially when she's
just been traipsing about</i>

32:56.028 --> 33:00.364
<i>Oh, oh, wouldn't she be
delightful, living in?</i>

33:00.365 --> 33:01.741
<i>Giving out</i>

33:01.742 --> 33:04.452
<i>Everybody ought to have a maid</i>

33:04.453 --> 33:07.330
<i>Someone who you hire
when you're short of help</i>

33:07.331 --> 33:12.457
<i>To offer you the sort of help
you never get from a spouse</i>

33:13.295 --> 33:16.380
<i>- Pattering through the attic
- Chattering in the cellar</i>

33:16.381 --> 33:19.258
<i>- Clattering in the kitchen
- Flattering in the bedroom</i>

33:19.259 --> 33:23.554
<i>Pottering all around the house</i>

33:23.555 --> 33:25.807
The virgin, how is she?

33:25.808 --> 33:27.016
- A maid.
- A maid.

33:27.017 --> 33:28.559
- A maid.
- A maid?

33:28.560 --> 33:31.270
<i>Everybody ought to have a maid</i>

33:31.271 --> 33:34.148
<i>Someone who's
efficient and reliable</i>

33:34.149 --> 33:38.943
<i>Obedient and pliable
and quieter than a mouse</i>

33:40.823 --> 33:43.658
<i>Oh, oh, wouldn't she be so nimble</i>

33:43.659 --> 33:46.536
<i>Fiddling with a
thimble, mending a gown?</i>

33:46.537 --> 33:50.915
<i>Oh, oh, wouldn't she be
delightful, cleaning up?</i>

33:50.916 --> 33:52.416
<i>Leaning down</i>

33:52.417 --> 33:55.128
<i>Everybody ought to have a maid</i>

33:55.129 --> 33:57.964
<i>Someone who'll be
busy as a bumblebee</i>

33:57.965 --> 34:00.216
<i>And even if you grumble</i>

34:00.217 --> 34:03.594
<i>Be as graceful as a grouse</i>

34:03.595 --> 34:06.764
<i>- Wriggling in the anteroom
- Jiggling in the living room</i>

34:06.765 --> 34:09.725
<i>- Giggling in the dining room
- Wiggling in the other rooms</i>

34:09.726 --> 34:14.105
<i>Pottering all around the house</i>

34:14.106 --> 34:17.817
The virgin, how is she?
Tell me, I want to know how she...

34:17.818 --> 34:20.652
<i>- The house
- How is the virgin?!</i>

34:20.654 --> 34:23.531
<i>The house</i>

34:23.532 --> 34:28.494
She's very low. Remember the smile?
It's now nearly a grin.

34:28.495 --> 34:33.498
I pray she lasts. I had a bad experience
with an officer to whom I had sold a virgin.

34:33.500 --> 34:36.085
- What happened?
- She turned out to be a dud.

34:36.085 --> 34:38.420
A dud virgin? How
could that happen?

34:38.422 --> 34:42.800
You see, the fellow who sold me the
dud virgin also sold me a dud eunuch.

34:42.801 --> 34:48.014
- I'll keep this one alive as long as I can.
- You're a saint.

34:48.014 --> 34:52.101
I shall instruct the new maid in
housework. Starting in my room.

34:52.101 --> 34:56.688
But, sir, your son may
be in that very house.

34:56.690 --> 34:57.815
Oh, dear.

34:57.816 --> 35:01.652
- Sir, this house is empty.
- So it is, sir.

35:01.653 --> 35:06.949
Before your friend Erronius went abroad in
search of his children stolen by pirates,

35:06.950 --> 35:09.368
he asked you to look
into his house.

35:09.369 --> 35:13.122
Yes. Now might be as good a time
as any. Send the girl in here.

35:13.123 --> 35:18.127
But, sir. Only my deepest devotion to
you allows me to speak so frankly.

35:18.128 --> 35:23.374
You have trudged the road some way, and
I fear that this great physical exertion...

35:26.053 --> 35:30.014
Great heavens. Is that me?

35:30.015 --> 35:33.059
I smell like an overheated horse.
I must bathe.

35:33.060 --> 35:37.973
At least. Shall I send the
girl to you, say, in one hour?

35:38.816 --> 35:41.604
At least.

35:49.326 --> 35:54.372
Home at last. After years of
searching for my long lost children,

35:54.373 --> 35:57.792
how good it is to see
this street once more.

35:57.793 --> 36:04.165
These tired old eyes fill with tears
at the sight of the little they see.

36:08.303 --> 36:12.140
Pardon me, young woman.
I'm sorry, but I...

36:12.141 --> 36:14.642
Oh, what a lovely baby.

36:14.643 --> 36:20.606
Just about the age of my children when
they were stolen in infancy by pirates.

36:20.607 --> 36:24.694
But at least I have the
comforts of my lonely home.

36:24.695 --> 36:26.195
Sir!

36:26.196 --> 36:30.783
- Who are you?
- Hysterium, sir. Servant to Senex.

36:30.784 --> 36:34.238
<i>Oh, everybody ought to have...</i>

36:35.539 --> 36:37.957
- What was that?
- I didn't hear anything.

36:37.958 --> 36:40.501
<i>Oh, oh...</i>

36:40.502 --> 36:42.420
I didn't hear that either.

36:42.421 --> 36:45.631
- It was an eerie sound.
- Eerie sound?

36:45.632 --> 36:47.550
Like the house was haunted.

36:47.551 --> 36:52.513
Sir, what I'm about to tell you is eerie.
Your house is haunted.

36:52.514 --> 36:55.057
- Haunted?
- Haunted as the day is long.

36:55.058 --> 36:58.895
Perhaps you should stay with
relatives, distant relatives.

36:58.896 --> 37:02.148
Yes. No. Fetch me a soothsayer.

37:02.149 --> 37:05.318
- A soothsayer?
- He must search my house at once.

37:10.908 --> 37:14.118
Sir, you're in need
of a soothsayer.

37:14.119 --> 37:18.202
- How did you know?
- I'd be a fine soothsayer if I didn't.

37:18.248 --> 37:22.367
- There's a spirit in my hou...
- Silence!

37:23.420 --> 37:25.671
I'm about to say the sooth.

37:25.672 --> 37:29.008
You... I see it. I see everything.

37:29.009 --> 37:32.303
You... you have been...

37:32.304 --> 37:35.181
abroad for...

37:35.182 --> 37:37.758
20 years. You have been...

37:37.893 --> 37:40.937
searching for...

37:40.938 --> 37:42.772
a child.

37:42.773 --> 37:45.312
No, two childs.

37:46.443 --> 37:49.315
A fine big boy...

37:50.614 --> 37:53.574
and a strange little boy.

37:53.575 --> 37:56.862
No, no.

37:58.372 --> 38:01.374
A girl! A girl. A boy and a girl.

38:01.375 --> 38:04.919
- Can you find them for me?
- Certainly I can find them.

38:04.920 --> 38:09.799
Each wear a ring that has engraved
upon it a gaggle of geese.

38:09.800 --> 38:14.887
There are only two more like this in
the world, and my children wear them.

38:14.888 --> 38:18.015
- How many geese in a gaggle?
- At least seven.

38:18.016 --> 38:21.102
Seven?! Before I say
the sooth again,

38:21.103 --> 38:25.481
you must run seven times around
the Seven Hills of Rome.

38:25.482 --> 38:30.653
- And the spirit?
- It will be gone after you do my bidding.

38:30.654 --> 38:32.363
- Thanks.
- To the hills!

38:32.364 --> 38:35.032
- To the hills.
- Oh.

38:35.033 --> 38:39.317
- This is the way, sir.
- Thank you, young woman.

38:41.081 --> 38:44.709
Sir, sir! You forgot your gaggle!

38:44.710 --> 38:47.795
You see? Everything
is turning out fine.

38:47.796 --> 38:52.425
When the master thinks the virgin's a
maid, the virgin thinks she's his mistress,

38:52.426 --> 38:54.802
and the mistress doesn't
know about her son?

38:54.803 --> 38:59.891
See that the master stays in the bath the
next hour, and I'll get the girl out of here.

38:59.892 --> 39:03.561
- How soon?
- When Hero brings more mare sweat.

39:03.562 --> 39:05.104
Mare sweat?!

39:05.105 --> 39:11.275
There's no need to remind me.
I need some more bath towels at once.

39:13.447 --> 39:17.197
Be patient, my dear. I shall
not keep you panting long.

39:25.542 --> 39:32.089
Come on, you rotten slave, move.
Pick those chains up. Come on!

39:32.090 --> 39:35.301
Ah, thank you, lad.
It is thirsty work.

39:35.302 --> 39:38.044
That's mine.

39:38.096 --> 39:40.423
Ah!

40:02.329 --> 40:06.415
- Yes?
- Is this the house of Marcus Lycus?

40:06.416 --> 40:09.372
- Yes.
- Then aside, eunuch.

40:14.216 --> 40:17.343
Inform Lycus we would
see him at once.

40:17.344 --> 40:21.180
Yes, possibilities. Carry on.
Was that a customer, dear eunuch?

40:21.181 --> 40:26.727
Welcome, most noble warrior. Won't you
come in? Perhaps some wine. Perhaps...

40:26.728 --> 40:28.521
No, no, no, no, no, no.

40:28.522 --> 40:32.400
We are emissaries from he for whom
a maiden was purchased from you.

40:32.401 --> 40:33.526
A maiden.

40:33.527 --> 40:38.489
She'll be claimed within the hour by our
illustrious captain, Miles Gloriosus.

40:38.490 --> 40:40.992
I know that name.
I don't think I like it.

40:40.993 --> 40:42.869
The mighty Miles bids you know

40:42.870 --> 40:47.248
that he did purchase a maiden from
scum such as yourself some years ago.

40:47.249 --> 40:51.335
This so-called maiden delivered proof
that she'd been nothing of the sort.

40:51.336 --> 40:55.923
- Accidents will happen.
- But never again to the great Gloriosus.

40:55.924 --> 41:00.303
Should anything be amiss with your
maiden, he'll seize your entire stock.

41:00.304 --> 41:03.764
- That's fair.
- And then he'll burn down your house.

41:03.765 --> 41:05.600
- Reasonable.
- Then he'll...

41:05.601 --> 41:11.105
No, no. Inform the captain the maid will be
ready and very willing and very healthy.

41:11.106 --> 41:13.191
Ah!

41:13.192 --> 41:15.565
With just a slight touch of plague.

41:16.069 --> 41:20.907
Excuse me. Have you seen a handsome
youth running after a sweating horse?

41:20.908 --> 41:23.201
Very generous of you, sir.

41:23.202 --> 41:28.289
Excuse me, madam. A cool youth and a
hot mare, have you by any chance...?

41:28.290 --> 41:30.833
Most kind of you, madam.

41:30.834 --> 41:33.790
Sir, might I ask...?

41:34.171 --> 41:37.126
Thank you humbly, sir.

41:47.017 --> 41:50.304
Master Hero has been here.

41:53.315 --> 41:56.187
Thank you kindly, sir.

41:57.194 --> 42:00.071
I'm sorry, I can't stop now. I...

42:00.072 --> 42:03.110
You've been sold? To whom?

42:03.325 --> 42:06.953
A Syrian shepherd? He's
collecting you within the hour.

42:06.954 --> 42:09.372
I may never see her again. Listen.

42:09.373 --> 42:10.957
In a few...

42:10.958 --> 42:14.791
In a few... Listen carefully!

42:21.218 --> 42:22.833
Aahh!

42:27.015 --> 42:31.477
In one hour the captain arrives.
How can I save my head?

42:31.478 --> 42:35.398
One hour before the Syrian shepherd
arrives. How can I save Gymnasia?

42:35.399 --> 42:39.068
If I could find someone to take
my place for an hour. But who?

42:39.069 --> 42:44.196
If I could but take Lycus's
place for one hour. But how?

42:44.783 --> 42:47.076
Excuse me. Not at all.

42:47.077 --> 42:49.537
- Pseudolus.
- Lycus.

42:49.538 --> 42:52.081
Hail, Marcus Lycus.
I was looking for you.

42:52.082 --> 42:54.041
But I was looking for you.

42:54.042 --> 42:55.835
- Isn't that amazing?
- Fantastic.

42:55.836 --> 42:58.087
It's about the girls...

42:58.088 --> 42:59.797
Did you say "It's about the girls?"

42:59.798 --> 43:01.132
- Yes. Did you?
- Yes.

43:01.133 --> 43:02.717
- Amazing.
- Fantastic.

43:02.718 --> 43:06.137
You see, it occurred to me
when you were in my place...

43:06.138 --> 43:08.639
- That I didn't have time...
- ..To decide...

43:08.640 --> 43:13.394
- ..about choosing a wife.
- Precisely. What a marvellous rapport.

43:13.395 --> 43:15.313
- Amazing.
- Fantastic.

43:15.314 --> 43:17.148
And so I was thinking...

43:17.149 --> 43:19.901
- That I'd spend more time...
- Alone...

43:19.902 --> 43:21.569
..with the girls.

43:21.570 --> 43:25.823
Lycus, you're making me cry.

43:25.824 --> 43:28.075
One other thing.
You see, my father...

43:28.076 --> 43:29.911
- You have a father?
- Yes.

43:29.912 --> 43:32.455
- Isn't that amazing?
- Fantastic.

43:32.456 --> 43:38.085
Furthermore, he's on his way to my house
and he thinks I'm just a tradesman.

43:38.086 --> 43:42.340
Poor fellow. But what if, when he arrives,
we have moved the girls elsewhere?

43:42.341 --> 43:46.260
Yes. But how to find a
suitable elsewhere.

43:46.261 --> 43:48.971
- Where else?
- The house of the good Senex.

43:48.972 --> 43:51.432
Why not? He's out of
the way for an hour.

43:51.433 --> 43:56.646
But who will take care of my place? The
shepherd comes to buy the silent woman.

43:56.647 --> 43:59.816
I don't suppose, Pseudolus,
I could impose upon you...

43:59.817 --> 44:03.277
To take your place? Pretend
that I'm you for an hour?

44:03.278 --> 44:05.863
Lycus, it would be a privilege.

44:05.864 --> 44:08.199
Oh, now you're making me cry.

44:08.200 --> 44:10.076
Oh, one more thing.

44:10.077 --> 44:13.913
The captain who comes for the virgin,
should he arrive while I'm gone...

44:13.914 --> 44:16.958
- Mind you, I do not...
- I'll just hand her over.

44:16.959 --> 44:19.877
If she's not alive, fob him
off with another girl.

44:19.878 --> 44:23.131
I'm told he's a most kind,
gentle and considerate man.

44:23.132 --> 44:25.758
- Have no fears.
- I won't, dear Pseudolus.

44:25.759 --> 44:29.675
And may I say, you will
never live to regret this.

44:34.101 --> 44:39.272
Gone to see a nose grinder indeed.
He's cavorting with those courtesans.

44:39.273 --> 44:42.233
- But, Mother, what can I do?
- Do?

44:42.234 --> 44:47.530
Return to Rome immediately, before he
can do what no doubt he's already done.

44:47.531 --> 44:49.442
Go!

44:57.416 --> 44:58.708
Come on, now.

44:58.709 --> 45:00.835
Right. Hey, hey!

45:00.836 --> 45:03.163
Hey!

45:08.510 --> 45:11.881
Come on, come on.

45:12.931 --> 45:14.599
Morning.

45:14.600 --> 45:18.936
Quickly, on your feet. The change
will do you good. Quick, quick. Out.

45:18.937 --> 45:21.731
- Come quickly.
- You there!

45:21.732 --> 45:24.025
- You there!
- Go, go.

45:24.026 --> 45:26.986
- Oh, there's so much of you there.
- Later, later.

45:26.987 --> 45:28.946
Go, go.

45:29.865 --> 45:34.911
Why do you stand here? Come on, we
have no time. Come, come, come, come.

45:34.912 --> 45:40.786
You will be gone before that shepherd
arrives. Can you leave immediately?

45:41.460 --> 45:44.212
No arguing. Go away. Come, come.

45:44.213 --> 45:47.882
Oh, Vibrata, really!
Go. Come, come.

45:47.883 --> 45:50.422
First time around.

45:51.804 --> 45:54.510
What was that?

46:05.400 --> 46:08.945
Ho, there. I am seeking the
house of Marcus Lycus.

46:08.946 --> 46:11.614
Who is it that reeks the
louse of Marcus Leakus?

46:11.615 --> 46:13.991
- Hold, sir!
- Who leaks the louse...?

46:13.992 --> 46:19.455
You're not holding, sir. Who is he
that seeks the house of Marcus Lycus?

46:19.456 --> 46:23.459
A foot soldier of Captain
Miles Gloriosus.

46:23.460 --> 46:25.920
- Smartly done.
- Thank you.

46:25.921 --> 46:29.632
My captain dispatches me to inform
you that he's half a league away,

46:29.633 --> 46:32.671
and bids you honour this.

46:35.848 --> 46:38.766
You know what this is, of course?

46:38.767 --> 46:43.438
Of course I know what this is.
This is... writing.

46:43.439 --> 46:47.233
- This is your contract with the captain.
- A pretty piece of work.

46:47.234 --> 46:50.486
- Thank you.
- What is this word here?

46:51.363 --> 46:53.903
That is "Lycus".

46:54.741 --> 46:57.618
- You realise who you are speaking to?
- Yes, sir.

46:57.619 --> 47:01.289
Do you realise what it says there?

47:01.290 --> 47:03.207
I know what it says there.

47:03.208 --> 47:07.044
Words. I intend to stand behind them
or my name is not Marcus Lycus.

47:07.045 --> 47:07.920
Pseudolus!

47:07.921 --> 47:10.756
Or my name is not
Pseudolus Marcus Lycus.

47:10.757 --> 47:13.926
One moment. I must have
a word with my eunuch.

47:13.927 --> 47:16.679
- Oh, please.
- Thank you very much.

47:16.680 --> 47:19.671
Come here, eunuch!

47:20.934 --> 47:24.645
Eunuch? How dare you call me that!

47:24.646 --> 47:28.274
You and I know it isn't true, so
why do we care what they think?

47:28.275 --> 47:32.612
- Why are you calling yourself Lycus?
- You see...

47:32.613 --> 47:36.449
- Why should I spoil your day?
- How can you spoil a total disaster?

47:36.450 --> 47:39.368
- The captain comes for the girl now.
- That's terrible.

47:39.369 --> 47:41.746
- Why?
- The master also wants her now.

47:41.747 --> 47:44.540
He can't have her! Just
keep him in that house.

47:44.541 --> 47:46.125
- But, Pseudolus...
- Lycus.

47:46.126 --> 47:47.460
- But, Pseudolus...
- Lycus.

47:47.461 --> 47:50.880
- But, Pseudolus...
- Lycus. I still know about that pottery.

47:50.881 --> 47:55.379
But, Lycus... Goodbye,
Lycus. Farewell, Lycus.

47:55.677 --> 47:58.633
Good luck, Lycus. He is Lycus.

47:59.598 --> 48:03.182
Tell your captain his bride awaits.

48:03.769 --> 48:06.143
Smartly done.

48:07.189 --> 48:09.232
- Hysterium!
- Sire?

48:09.233 --> 48:15.029
Remember that potion which so fills one
with energy one can perform miracles?

48:15.030 --> 48:19.158
Oh, yes, sire. We still have some
left from your wedding night.

48:19.159 --> 48:22.530
- Bring me a beaker.
- Yes, master.

48:23.956 --> 48:27.326
Good afternoon. Good afternoon.

48:31.922 --> 48:34.462
Good afternoon.

48:54.278 --> 48:58.573
<i>My bride, my bride,
I've come to claim my bride</i>

48:58.574 --> 49:02.493
<i>Come tenderly to crush
her against my side</i>

49:02.494 --> 49:06.497
<i>Let haste be made,
I cannot be delayed</i>

49:06.498 --> 49:11.043
<i>There are lands to conquer,
cities to loot, and peoples to degrade</i>

49:11.044 --> 49:13.880
<i>Look at those arms, look at
that chest... look at them!</i>

49:13.881 --> 49:18.426
<i>Not to mention the rest...
even I am impressed!</i>

49:18.427 --> 49:22.722
<i>My bride, my bride,
come, bring to me my bride</i>

49:22.723 --> 49:26.684
<i>My lust for her no
longer can be denied</i>

49:26.685 --> 49:30.730
<i>Convey the news
I have no time to lose</i>

49:30.731 --> 49:35.276
<i>There are towns to plunder,
temples to burn, and women to abuse</i>

49:35.277 --> 49:37.361
<i>Look at that foot,
look at that heel</i>

49:37.362 --> 49:39.363
<i>Mark the magnificent
muscles of steel</i>

49:39.364 --> 49:43.565
<i>I am my ideal</i>

49:45.746 --> 49:49.707
<i>I, Miles Gloriosus</i>

49:49.708 --> 49:53.628
<i>I, slaughterer of thousands</i>

49:53.629 --> 49:56.464
<i>I, oppressor of the meek</i>

49:56.465 --> 49:58.549
<i>Subduer of the weak</i>

49:58.550 --> 50:00.593
<i>Degrader of the Greek</i>

50:00.594 --> 50:02.720
<i>Destroyer of the Turk</i>

50:02.721 --> 50:06.098
<i>Must hurry back to work</i>

50:06.099 --> 50:10.103
<i>I, Miles Gloriosus</i>

50:10.104 --> 50:14.232
<i>I, paragon of virtues</i>

50:14.233 --> 50:17.276
<i>I, in war the most admired</i>

50:17.277 --> 50:19.403
<i>In wit the most inspired</i>

50:19.404 --> 50:21.364
<i>In love the most desired</i>

50:21.365 --> 50:23.699
<i>In dress the best displayed</i>

50:23.700 --> 50:26.744
<i>I am a parade</i>

50:26.745 --> 50:28.830
<i>Look at those eyes,
cunning and keen</i>

50:28.831 --> 50:31.249
<i>Look at the size of those
thighs, like a mighty machine</i>

50:31.250 --> 50:34.168
<i>Those are the mightiest
thighs I ever have theen</i>

50:34.169 --> 50:35.545
<i>I mean...</i>

50:35.546 --> 50:39.549
<i>My bride, my bride,
inform my lucky bride</i>

50:39.550 --> 50:43.261
<i>The fabled arms of
Miles are open wide</i>

50:43.262 --> 50:46.931
<i>Make haste, make haste,
I have no time to waste</i>

50:46.932 --> 50:51.102
<i>There are shrines I should be
sacking, ribs I should be cracking</i>

50:51.103 --> 50:56.065
<i>Eyes to gouge and booty to divide</i>

50:56.066 --> 51:01.727
<i>Bring me my bride</i>

51:09.246 --> 51:14.741
Stand aside, everyone.
I take large steps.

51:14.751 --> 51:17.795
- Hail, Miles Gloriosus!
- You are?

51:17.796 --> 51:20.506
Marcus Lycus. I am dazzled
by your presence.

51:20.507 --> 51:23.176
Everyone is. Where is my bride?

51:23.177 --> 51:26.846
It is a sad tale I have to tell the
captain. Bad news... Argh!

51:26.847 --> 51:30.475
Did not my aide inform you
that should anything be amiss,

51:30.476 --> 51:34.061
your house would be burnt, your
women seized and your life forfeit?

51:34.062 --> 51:36.272
He didn't. Did he?

51:36.273 --> 51:39.809
- He did.
- He did! And I meant it.

51:40.819 --> 51:44.614
There's been some mistake.
Here! Here is the man you want.

51:44.615 --> 51:46.324
Tell him who I am.

51:46.325 --> 51:49.410
- Everybody knows who you are, Lycus.
- No.

51:49.411 --> 51:54.248
- Tell him who I am. Tell him!
- Rely on me. He is Marcus Lycus.

51:54.249 --> 51:56.250
Not so! He is Lycus.

51:56.251 --> 51:59.670
Sire, if you look within you
will find none but hooded men.

51:59.671 --> 52:05.051
We are a holy order, an ancient
brotherhood of lepers. Unclean, unclean.

52:05.052 --> 52:07.261
"Unclean, unclean."

52:07.262 --> 52:10.723
- Well, Lycus, what of this bad news?
- There is no bad news.

52:10.724 --> 52:15.436
I only say that so as not to make
the gods jealous. She is ugly. Ugly!

52:15.437 --> 52:17.730
Ugly! Ugly!

52:17.731 --> 52:19.816
Really, she's beautiful.

52:19.817 --> 52:23.820
- I did not want them envying you.
- What is she like?

52:23.821 --> 52:26.322
A face so fair, a heart so pure.

52:26.323 --> 52:31.035
Sir, if you had been born a
woman, you would have been she.

52:31.036 --> 52:33.746
As magnificent as that?

52:33.747 --> 52:36.040
She will be ready soon. Some food?

52:36.041 --> 52:38.960
That is unnecessary.
I will await her in your house.

52:38.961 --> 52:40.878
- No!
- No?

52:40.879 --> 52:43.214
I meant yes. It just came out no.

52:43.215 --> 52:46.300
- And who are you?
- My chief eunuch, sir.

52:46.301 --> 52:48.803
Just kick him if he offends you.

52:48.804 --> 52:53.182
Surround the house. While I am
within, let no one else enter.

52:53.183 --> 52:56.894
What was that all about?
Why didn't you give him the girl?

52:56.895 --> 52:59.021
It's time we two
trusted each other.

52:59.022 --> 53:01.941
One of us isn't ready.
Why didn't you give him the girl?

53:01.942 --> 53:07.864
She refuses to go with him. But Master
Hero's out getting her a potion.

53:07.865 --> 53:10.158
So keep the master
in his bath until...

53:10.159 --> 53:14.745
Arrange food, drink, entertainment
and a sit-down orgy for 14.

53:14.746 --> 53:18.166
These sands will run out
in exactly one half-hour.

53:18.167 --> 53:22.962
If my bride is not delivered by then, this
house will be an empty patch of ground.

53:22.963 --> 53:24.755
That rotten Lycus!

53:24.756 --> 53:26.966
That lovely Pseudolus.

53:26.967 --> 53:28.426
Mm!

53:28.427 --> 53:34.390
What a glorious day. Won't you join me in
a beaker? Everyone, a beaker with me. I...

53:34.391 --> 53:37.143
- Crassus!
- Marcus?

53:37.144 --> 53:39.937
I heard you were abroad
in search of pulchritude.

53:39.938 --> 53:43.232
I returned this morn. With as
choice a cargo as you've seen.

53:43.233 --> 53:45.526
- Good man.
- From Crete.

53:45.527 --> 53:50.114
Crete? Do not touch me. Do not breathe
on me. The plague. The plague!

53:50.115 --> 53:52.158
There's no plague on Crete.

53:52.159 --> 53:55.661
No plague? No one lying around,
smiling themselves to death?

53:55.662 --> 53:59.290
- It's the healthiest isle in the world.
- He lied to me, tricked me.

53:59.291 --> 54:00.708
You, tricked?

54:00.709 --> 54:05.171
Yes. But not for long. I go to the captain
and see that that swine is killed!

54:05.172 --> 54:09.383
- Which swine?
- The lyingest, cheatingest slave in Rome.

54:09.384 --> 54:11.052
Oh, Pseudolus.

54:11.053 --> 54:13.380
Hmm.

54:36.912 --> 54:39.452
Chapter six.

54:40.249 --> 54:44.581
The Sabine campaign, in
which a boy becomes a man.

54:45.337 --> 54:48.965
Laden with the spoils of conquest,
I then set forth for Egypt,

54:48.966 --> 54:52.510
little knowing that here waited for
me that black-fringed temptress

54:52.511 --> 54:55.555
who was to play so
great a part in my...

54:55.556 --> 54:56.722
Foot!

54:56.723 --> 54:59.761
Oh, get off, get off, get off!

55:00.519 --> 55:04.851
As you know, at this time all Gaul
was divided into eight parts.

55:09.862 --> 55:13.823
Agh! Back, leper. Bring not your
contagion into the house of Lycus.

55:13.824 --> 55:18.536
House of...? Pseudolus, tell them
who I am. I am no leper. I am Lycus!

55:18.537 --> 55:23.291
Ah, the poor creature. Just jab him
back into his den of ill health.

55:23.292 --> 55:25.126
What?

55:25.127 --> 55:29.422
Oh, Pseudolus, I'll have my revenge.
I'll get in to see the captain yet.

55:29.423 --> 55:33.092
This I swear by the great
Necrophites, god of procurers...

55:33.093 --> 55:34.218
panderers...

55:34.219 --> 55:36.759
and go-betweens.

55:37.389 --> 55:41.017
A new god, but a very hard worker.

55:41.018 --> 55:46.189
"I rely on you, Miles" said Caesar
firmly. "Hold that Tiber."

55:46.190 --> 55:50.818
Yes, that's good. "Hold that...
hold that Tiber."

55:50.944 --> 55:56.023
If you see a lad with mare sweat,
send him up to the green bedroom.

56:05.083 --> 56:07.335
Not down there!

56:07.336 --> 56:10.421
When I heard the revellers,
I thought my captain had come.

56:10.422 --> 56:14.342
He has, but he's not ready yet.
Just wait in there. Wait. Wait, wait!

56:14.343 --> 56:18.757
That's what virgins are
supposed to do best.

56:23.018 --> 56:27.105
- My man has come for me.
- Good. Where is he?

56:27.106 --> 56:30.566
Wait, my little one.
I must wash my hands.

56:30.567 --> 56:34.320
I shall be back in a nonce.
At most, two nonces.

56:34.321 --> 56:38.949
I shall knock on the
door three times.

56:45.874 --> 56:47.750
- Where'd she go?
- In there.

56:47.751 --> 56:51.335
Knock three times and she's yours.

56:51.964 --> 56:54.841
One, two, three.

56:54.842 --> 56:56.587
Four.

56:57.219 --> 56:59.971
The hourglass!

56:59.972 --> 57:04.100
Sir... May I suggest,
sir, just one more scrub?

57:04.101 --> 57:10.805
No, that's enough. One more scrub
and you'll wash away my enthusiasm.

57:14.695 --> 57:17.989
All right, now. I want everybody...
Listen, will you?!

57:17.990 --> 57:21.906
When I say push, push hard.
Push terribly hard. Push!

57:35.799 --> 57:39.260
No entry? I live, eat and sleep
here every day of my life.

57:39.261 --> 57:42.805
Congratulations. But today
it's officers only.

57:42.806 --> 57:47.090
Master, the passion potion.
You must drink it while it's hot.

57:59.448 --> 58:06.033
If you are the new gardeners, don't
lean on those things, get to work.

58:09.249 --> 58:12.999
Where is it? Where is
my passion potion?

58:14.588 --> 58:19.714
Where is everyone? Senex?
Pseudolus? Hysterium?

58:20.010 --> 58:21.344
Madam!

58:21.345 --> 58:25.431
Where is my husband? On good intuition,
I believe he is fouling the nest.

58:25.432 --> 58:29.727
And he has brought in the legions
to help. Who are all these people?

58:29.728 --> 58:34.816
Madam, the hospitality of your house
is being enjoyed by Miles Gloriosus.

58:34.817 --> 58:37.485
- The Gloriosus?
- The The himself.

58:37.486 --> 58:40.196
He requested a rest in
your charming residence.

58:40.197 --> 58:43.116
As a general's daughter,
I hoped you would not object.

58:43.117 --> 58:46.160
Object? Pseudolus,
you have acted well.

58:46.161 --> 58:48.496
I must greet this captain at once.

58:48.497 --> 58:53.084
Captain Gloriosus, I am shattered that
I was not here to greet you personally.

58:53.085 --> 58:56.712
- You are of this house?
- For many, many years.

58:56.713 --> 59:00.091
My father, you know,
Captain, was General Magnus.

59:00.092 --> 59:03.719
On the last anniversary of his death,
I entertained over 200 officers.

59:03.720 --> 59:06.222
200? By yourself?

59:06.223 --> 59:10.726
Not entirely. Hysterium
here was a great help.

59:10.727 --> 59:16.065
Oh, Hysterium, thoughtful as ever.
My mouth is dry after that dusty drive.

59:16.066 --> 59:18.606
Mad... Oh...

59:25.909 --> 59:31.914
After I've bathed and changed this dusty
robe, I want you to ask the captain to...

59:31.915 --> 59:34.125
Where did you say my husband was?

59:34.126 --> 59:36.919
I, uh... Your hus...
He is... he is...

59:36.920 --> 59:39.797
Well, at the moment he is, uh...

59:39.798 --> 59:44.427
He is, uh... he is... At least,
when I last saw him he was.

59:44.428 --> 59:47.013
I want to know if my
husband is in the house.

59:47.014 --> 59:52.059
No, but he should be here soon. Madam,
might I suggest you take your bath now?

59:52.060 --> 59:54.562
I shall send slaves
with a fresh robe.

59:54.563 --> 59:57.857
When he arrives, keep
him busy downstairs.

59:57.858 --> 01:00:04.562
And tell the captain I shall be awaiting
him in the green room, after my bath.

01:00:06.658 --> 01:00:09.243
- What do we do?
- I'll deal with the master.

01:00:09.244 --> 01:00:14.373
You keep that hourglass from running out,
and I'll be grateful to you as long as I live.

01:00:14.374 --> 01:00:16.369
If I live that long.

01:00:23.383 --> 01:00:24.967
Master!

01:00:24.968 --> 01:00:27.512
- All right, where is she?
- Who?

01:00:27.513 --> 01:00:31.182
- The new maid.
- Oh, the maid? The very new maid?

01:00:31.183 --> 01:00:34.018
Knock three times and she's yours.

01:00:34.019 --> 01:00:38.433
- Ah! What about my passion potion?
- Start without.

01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:45.863
- House of Lycus?
- Yes. What about it?

01:00:45.864 --> 01:00:49.283
Acrobats for the orgy.

01:00:49.284 --> 01:00:52.322
- That way.
- Thanks.

01:01:12.057 --> 01:01:15.095
Back to the peeling.

01:01:17.563 --> 01:01:20.554
Sorry, wrong maid.

01:01:21.275 --> 01:01:26.401
Quickly, quickly. We must
find another room for you.

01:01:43.172 --> 01:01:45.506
- My filly!
- My stallion!

01:01:45.507 --> 01:01:46.841
- My wife.
- My husband.

01:01:46.842 --> 01:01:48.622
My gods!

01:02:00.314 --> 01:02:04.763
You're late. The others are
waiting for you in there.

01:02:08.363 --> 01:02:12.116
- Entertainers that way.
- I must see the captain. Very important.

01:02:12.117 --> 01:02:14.494
- Entertainers that way!
- Captain...

01:02:14.495 --> 01:02:18.623
Listen. Do you know what
happened to the last underling

01:02:18.624 --> 01:02:22.001
who interrupted the
captain in mid-debauch?

01:02:22.002 --> 01:02:25.373
- Entertainers this way.
- Yes.

01:02:26.298 --> 01:02:28.883
- Where is Hero?
- Calm.

01:02:28.884 --> 01:02:31.385
- How is the mistress?
- Calm.

01:02:31.386 --> 01:02:34.597
What happened to the master?
Why is the virgin...?

01:02:34.598 --> 01:02:38.309
Calm yourself! Calm! I'll tell
you when it's time to panic!

01:02:38.310 --> 01:02:41.301
- I smell mischief.
- It's time.

01:02:41.605 --> 01:02:44.565
Someone has tampered with this.

01:02:44.566 --> 01:02:47.485
- Bring me my bride.
- She'll be ready soon.

01:02:47.486 --> 01:02:51.739
They are just anointing her with unguents
to make her ankle bangle dangle.

01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:55.284
Meanwhile, for your
further entertainment...

01:02:55.285 --> 01:02:58.287
Bring on the acrobats!

01:02:58.288 --> 01:03:01.458
"Ankle bangle dangle"

01:03:01.875 --> 01:03:06.503
Watch there, the Four
Tumbling Tuscans.

01:03:14.263 --> 01:03:17.467
Psst! Lycus!

01:03:28.819 --> 01:03:33.489
That one is very good. He really makes
it look as though he landed on his head.

01:03:33.490 --> 01:03:37.535
Would you like to see that man again?
That man again for the captain.

01:03:37.536 --> 01:03:39.328
Captain, I have news. The...

01:03:39.329 --> 01:03:40.955
Waaaah!

01:03:40.956 --> 01:03:45.334
Captain, please. I... Captain,
the virgin is... Captain, a word.

01:03:45.335 --> 01:03:48.504
Louder music. The captain
wants louder music.

01:03:48.505 --> 01:03:50.673
I'm not happy in my work, Captain.

01:03:50.674 --> 01:03:54.343
Have you ever seen a jester like this?
The remarks he makes!

01:03:54.344 --> 01:03:57.680
- He's the best I've ever seen.
- But his exit.

01:03:57.681 --> 01:04:00.719
- Do the flying exit.
- What?!

01:04:02.686 --> 01:04:04.645
Waaaah!

01:04:06.648 --> 01:04:10.318
- Didn't I tell you you'd enjoy this?
- I did, yes.

01:04:10.319 --> 01:04:13.988
You are a good fellow. It's really
going to pain me to kill you.

01:04:13.989 --> 01:04:15.823
- Kill me?
- Indeed, Lycus.

01:04:15.824 --> 01:04:19.660
- If she is not at my feet in two minutes.
- Could you make it five?

01:04:19.661 --> 01:04:22.830
- Two.
- Two. Two minutes.

01:04:22.831 --> 01:04:25.583
Philia! Phil... Philia!

01:04:25.584 --> 01:04:29.712
- You go to the captain now, like it or not.
- But I've been ready.

01:04:29.713 --> 01:04:32.423
But Pseudolus said
you refused to. Come.

01:04:32.424 --> 01:04:35.468
Bring me that girl
or you'll all perish!

01:04:35.469 --> 01:04:37.512
That's not a happy captain.

01:04:37.513 --> 01:04:41.766
- That voice. I know that voice.
- Of course you do. That's your captain.

01:04:41.767 --> 01:04:45.436
That's not my captain. That's the brute
who raped my country, Thrace.

01:04:45.437 --> 01:04:47.021
He raped Thrace?

01:04:47.022 --> 01:04:51.234
- Then he came and did it again and again.
- He raped Thrace thrice?

01:04:51.235 --> 01:04:53.486
I'm not going with him.

01:04:53.487 --> 01:04:56.739
- Will you now go with Hero?
- Oh, yes, yes.

01:04:56.740 --> 01:05:00.326
Go back to Hero's
room and wait there.

01:05:00.327 --> 01:05:03.329
- He'll burn our house.
- Fear not. I have a plan.

01:05:03.330 --> 01:05:04.831
I don't want to hear it.

01:05:04.832 --> 01:05:09.001
- We tell the captain the virgin has died.
- I think I heard that.

01:05:09.002 --> 01:05:13.131
- We'll need a body. Anybody's body.
- Get one from Gusto the body snatcher.

01:05:13.132 --> 01:05:16.759
He owes me a favour.
But he died yesterday.

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:19.595
- What about his body?
- Somebody snatched it.

01:05:19.596 --> 01:05:24.308
- Who do we know that's dead?
- I wish I was.

01:05:32.943 --> 01:05:37.655
I'm a disgrace to my family.
My father will turn in his grave.

01:05:37.656 --> 01:05:39.532
Your father is alive.

01:05:39.533 --> 01:05:41.701
This will kill him.

01:05:41.702 --> 01:05:46.330
Just lie down. It'll be
all over in one moment.

01:05:50.377 --> 01:05:53.129
- You're delicious.
- What if he tries to kiss me?

01:05:53.130 --> 01:05:56.883
- He won't kiss you.
- How can he help it if I'm so delicious?

01:05:56.884 --> 01:06:01.713
Come back here.
Just lie still. Lie still.

01:06:01.763 --> 01:06:05.808
The captain will see you, shudder,
and go on his way heartbroken.

01:06:05.809 --> 01:06:09.771
It'll never work.
Look at me. Just look at me.

01:06:09.772 --> 01:06:13.357
I can't take my eyes off you.

01:06:13.358 --> 01:06:16.611
<i>You're lovely</i>

01:06:16.612 --> 01:06:20.281
<i>Absolutely lovely</i>

01:06:20.282 --> 01:06:26.037
<i>Who'd believe the
loveliness of you?</i>

01:06:26.038 --> 01:06:28.581
- No!
- Get back here and lie down.

01:06:28.582 --> 01:06:31.000
<i>Perfect</i>

01:06:31.001 --> 01:06:34.879
<i>Sweet and warm and winsome</i>

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:42.929
<i>Radiant as in some dream come true</i>

01:06:42.930 --> 01:06:48.934
<i>Now Venus will seem tame</i>

01:06:49.269 --> 01:06:56.483
<i>Helen and her thousand ships
will have to die of shame</i>

01:06:56.819 --> 01:07:00.236
<i>You're so lovely</i>

01:07:00.239 --> 01:07:04.033
<i>Frighteningly lovely</i>

01:07:04.034 --> 01:07:11.916
<i>That the world will
never seem the same</i>

01:07:11.917 --> 01:07:15.002
<i>I'm lovely</i>

01:07:15.003 --> 01:07:18.422
<i>Absolutely lovely</i>

01:07:18.423 --> 01:07:23.761
<i>Who'd believe the
loveliness of me?</i>

01:07:23.762 --> 01:07:26.139
I would.

01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:28.307
<i>Perfect</i>

01:07:28.308 --> 01:07:31.978
<i>Sweet and warm and winsome</i>

01:07:31.979 --> 01:07:39.610
<i>Radiant as in some dream come true</i>

01:07:39.611 --> 01:07:42.447
<i>Now...</i>

01:07:42.448 --> 01:07:46.325
- Shouldn't I have some jewellery?
- Jewellery? Well, I...

01:07:46.326 --> 01:07:49.364
- Erronius's gaggle.
- Ah!

01:07:51.582 --> 01:07:55.543
<i>I'm so lovely</i>

01:07:55.544 --> 01:07:59.172
<i>Literally lovely</i>

01:07:59.173 --> 01:08:03.926
<i>That the world
will never seem the same</i>

01:08:03.927 --> 01:08:07.096
<i>You're so lovely</i>

01:08:07.097 --> 01:08:16.386
<i>That the world will
never seem the same</i>

01:08:21.444 --> 01:08:25.281
Now I go get the
pallbearers. Wait here.

01:08:25.282 --> 01:08:28.158
- I'll never get away with it.
- You will. It's easy.

01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:31.613
Just lie still and
think dead thoughts.

01:08:59.858 --> 01:09:04.194
The time is up! Ransack the house!

01:09:04.196 --> 01:09:08.029
Oh, woe. Oh, woe.

01:09:08.242 --> 01:09:10.076
Oh, woe.

01:09:10.077 --> 01:09:12.783
And "Oh, woe" again.

01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:18.292
Ha! For the last time,
where is my bride?

01:09:18.292 --> 01:09:21.087
For the very last time,
here is your bride.

01:09:21.087 --> 01:09:24.966
Here on this appalling pall, dead.

01:09:24.966 --> 01:09:28.261
Dead, permanently dead.

01:09:28.261 --> 01:09:29.804
Dead, dead.

01:09:29.805 --> 01:09:34.642
O monstrous fate!
My sweet innocent bride... dead.

01:09:34.643 --> 01:09:37.520
Yes. Give her air!

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:40.106
- How did she die?
- She rolled over and...

01:09:40.107 --> 01:09:41.941
No, no. How did it happen?

01:09:41.942 --> 01:09:45.778
One glimpse of your grandeur from
above, the shock was too much.

01:09:45.779 --> 01:09:50.992
Poor child, a virgin till the end.
A lot of good it did you.

01:09:50.993 --> 01:09:55.705
- Spare me. I cannot control my tears.
- Go ahead. It's nature's release.

01:09:55.706 --> 01:10:00.543
Her bridal bower becomes a burial
bier of bitter bereavement.

01:10:00.544 --> 01:10:01.669
Very good.

01:10:01.670 --> 01:10:06.090
Can you say "Titus the tailor told ten
tall tales to Titania the titmouse"?

01:10:06.091 --> 01:10:09.594
Do not try to cheer me.
I am inconsolable.

01:10:09.595 --> 01:10:12.638
- Why torture yourself? Just go.
- Yes.

01:10:12.639 --> 01:10:17.685
Yes. Poor girl... to have died so young
without ever having experienced me.

01:10:17.686 --> 01:10:19.437
Well...

01:10:19.438 --> 01:10:24.192
No. I cannot leave without giving her the
comfort of a proper funeral service.

01:10:24.193 --> 01:10:27.653
Do you have time? Isn't there
a war you should be starting?

01:10:27.654 --> 01:10:29.155
- Silence!
- Silence!

01:10:29.156 --> 01:10:32.992
I insist on conducting a funeral.
Summon mourners.

01:10:32.993 --> 01:10:35.453
Mourners. Mourners? Back.

01:10:35.454 --> 01:10:37.163
Back, back, back.

01:10:37.164 --> 01:10:40.666
- A funeral?
- A rapid requiem, a quick dirge.

01:10:40.667 --> 01:10:43.461
- But any coins he puts on my eyes I keep.
- Done.

01:10:43.462 --> 01:10:45.705
I certainly have been.

01:10:45.798 --> 01:10:49.133
Gather firewood.
She shall be cremated.

01:10:53.472 --> 01:10:57.056
Uh...

01:10:57.476 --> 01:11:02.104
You're to take that immediately
up to the green bedroom.

01:11:17.621 --> 01:11:19.372
- Son!
- Father!

01:11:19.373 --> 01:11:21.082
My passion potion.

01:11:21.083 --> 01:11:24.038
No! It...

01:11:25.254 --> 01:11:27.497
It's not his potion.

01:11:27.506 --> 01:11:31.050
Forgive me for ever
mistrusting you, my darling.

01:11:31.051 --> 01:11:34.920
But you have been a little
distant these past 29 years.

01:11:40.018 --> 01:11:43.354
I shall compose a funeral dirge.

01:11:43.355 --> 01:11:45.356
Oh, do. A nice short one.

01:11:45.357 --> 01:11:49.819
<i>Gather round,
handmaidens of sorrow</i>

01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:53.114
<i>Sound the flute</i>

01:11:53.115 --> 01:11:55.658
<i>Blow the horn</i>

01:11:55.659 --> 01:11:59.245
<i>Pluck the lute</i>

01:11:59.246 --> 01:12:02.319
<i>Forward mourn</i>

01:12:13.552 --> 01:12:17.753
<i>Ah, ah</i>

01:12:19.558 --> 01:12:22.518
<i>All Crete was at her feet</i>

01:12:22.519 --> 01:12:25.480
<i>All Thrace was in her thrall</i>

01:12:25.481 --> 01:12:28.524
<i>All Sparta loved her sweetness</i>

01:12:28.525 --> 01:12:31.486
<i>- And Gaul
- And Spain</i>

01:12:31.487 --> 01:12:34.280
<i>- And Greece
- And Egypt</i>

01:12:34.281 --> 01:12:38.909
<i>- And Syria
- And Mesopotamia</i>

01:12:44.208 --> 01:12:46.292
- What's that?
- It's a funeral.

01:12:46.293 --> 01:12:49.331
Oh. Somebody's dead, eh?

01:12:50.005 --> 01:12:52.089
The captain's maiden.

01:12:52.090 --> 01:12:54.630
The captain's maiden?!

01:13:01.141 --> 01:13:03.681
- She's dead.
- Yeah.

01:13:04.770 --> 01:13:07.808
Then I shall kill myself.

01:13:09.149 --> 01:13:13.903
It's against Roman law to take
one's own life. The penalty's death.

01:13:13.904 --> 01:13:17.532
- I'll fight a gladiator, then.
- You might win.

01:13:17.533 --> 01:13:19.534
Yeah.

01:13:19.535 --> 01:13:23.819
I shall throw myself to the lions.

01:13:33.924 --> 01:13:36.926
<i>Speak the spells</i>

01:13:36.927 --> 01:13:39.752
<i>Chant the chants</i>

01:13:40.305 --> 01:13:42.798
Toll the bells!

01:13:43.225 --> 01:13:46.394
Fold the arms.

01:13:50.274 --> 01:13:54.527
On behalf of the body, I'd like to
thank you for a lovely funeral.

01:13:54.528 --> 01:13:57.655
I don't know about you,
but I've suffered enough.

01:13:57.656 --> 01:14:02.320
So I suggest you depart,
and I shall take the body and...

01:14:02.411 --> 01:14:05.828
- Second dirge.
- Second dirge!

01:14:07.875 --> 01:14:10.710
Throw himself to the lions!

01:14:10.711 --> 01:14:13.583
Then I too must die.

01:14:14.715 --> 01:14:19.135
Today's the day of the human sacrifice
at the temple of the vestal virgins.

01:14:19.136 --> 01:14:22.305
I shall go and offer
myself to the gods.

01:14:26.518 --> 01:14:29.592
- Hey, see that?
- Yes, but look at that!

01:14:33.150 --> 01:14:34.609
What's your hurry?

01:14:34.610 --> 01:14:37.987
Would you lower your pike to
your captain's plaything?

01:14:37.988 --> 01:14:40.948
Captain? I've had no instructions.

01:14:40.949 --> 01:14:43.451
The captain sent for me especially.

01:14:43.452 --> 01:14:50.541
Let me by, and... I'll redeem this in ways
that will melt every bolt in your armour.

01:14:50.542 --> 01:14:53.461
- Is it real?
- Bite it and see.

01:14:53.462 --> 01:14:56.417
And that goes for me, too.

01:15:12.481 --> 01:15:15.358
<i>Strew the soil</i>

01:15:15.359 --> 01:15:18.027
<i>Strum the lyre</i>

01:15:18.028 --> 01:15:21.197
<i>Spread the oil</i>

01:15:21.198 --> 01:15:23.783
<i>Build the pyre</i>

01:15:23.784 --> 01:15:26.494
Pyre? What kind of pyre?

01:15:26.495 --> 01:15:28.496
A pyre of fire.

01:15:28.497 --> 01:15:31.036
Oh, a fire pyre.

01:15:32.084 --> 01:15:34.377
- She must be burnt.
- Burnt?

01:15:34.378 --> 01:15:37.713
- I want her ashes.
- Ashes? Oh!

01:15:37.714 --> 01:15:39.966
Captain! Captain.

01:15:39.967 --> 01:15:44.971
Captain, I implore you. It is not
for us to destroy such loveliness.

01:15:44.972 --> 01:15:50.268
The gods are awaiting her. They would
be angry if we sent up a smoked virgin.

01:15:50.269 --> 01:15:53.271
- I cannot afford to offend the gods.
- Who can?

01:15:53.272 --> 01:15:55.273
I will go my melancholy way.

01:15:55.274 --> 01:15:58.109
Very good, sir. Goodbye, sir.

01:15:58.110 --> 01:16:00.528
Wait.

01:16:00.529 --> 01:16:02.613
A farewell kiss.

01:16:02.614 --> 01:16:04.824
Of course.

01:16:04.825 --> 01:16:06.826
Not you.

01:16:06.827 --> 01:16:12.331
You mustn't. It could make you very sick.
She died of an illness contracted in Crete.

01:16:12.332 --> 01:16:15.168
- What illness?
- The plague.

01:16:15.169 --> 01:16:17.708
- The plague!
- Plague!

01:16:23.677 --> 01:16:26.502
Run for your lives!

01:16:30.601 --> 01:16:33.140
- Silence!
- Silence! Shh!

01:16:34.730 --> 01:16:36.397
- There is no plague.
- What?

01:16:36.398 --> 01:16:39.776
I have this day returned from
Crete and there is no plague.

01:16:39.777 --> 01:16:42.570
Then what was everyone
yelling about?

01:16:42.571 --> 01:16:45.656
Find me the captain.
Don't stand there.

01:16:45.657 --> 01:16:48.326
You, find me the captain.

01:16:48.327 --> 01:16:52.288
Sir, I bring wonderful news.
The virgin does not have the plague.

01:16:52.289 --> 01:16:55.541
Silence, woman. I know that.
She died of other causes.

01:16:55.542 --> 01:16:58.419
Died? She was a bab... How...?

01:16:58.420 --> 01:17:02.757
Poor little moth. She
fluttered too near my flame.

01:17:02.758 --> 01:17:07.011
- Too filled with love, dear little heart.
- Heart.

01:17:07.012 --> 01:17:11.349
Yes, that's it. I shall cut out her heart
and carry it with me for evermore.

01:17:11.350 --> 01:17:13.518
- She's alive!
- And will stay that way!

01:17:13.519 --> 01:17:17.146
- Treachery! Treason! Seize her!
- I'll get her.

01:17:17.147 --> 01:17:21.651
Seize everyone! Put the whole
neighbourhood to the sword!

01:17:21.652 --> 01:17:25.696
Sir, a question. If I found your
maiden, would you spare my...

01:17:25.697 --> 01:17:27.115
A moment.

01:17:27.116 --> 01:17:31.202
If the maiden is not found,
I shall destroy not only this house,

01:17:31.203 --> 01:17:34.914
but all surrounding houses and
every single person in them!

01:17:34.915 --> 01:17:38.501
- And now, your question.
- It was just a silly girlish idea.

01:17:38.502 --> 01:17:40.545
I'll find your maiden.

01:17:40.546 --> 01:17:45.174
Ah! Now then, my beauty,
redeem your promise.

01:17:47.010 --> 01:17:50.096
You wildcat, you're beautiful
when you're angry.

01:17:50.097 --> 01:17:53.307
- Ruined! Ruined!
- We have to find Hero and Philia.

01:17:53.308 --> 01:17:55.560
Oh, look! Do you see what she said?

01:17:55.561 --> 01:17:57.812
What is it? And
please don't tell me.

01:17:57.813 --> 01:18:02.567
Philia's sacrificing herself and
Hero's throwing himself to the lions.

01:18:02.568 --> 01:18:06.237
Come, Gymnasia. Hie you
to the temple for Philia.

01:18:06.238 --> 01:18:09.866
I'll save Hero and meet you there!

01:18:09.867 --> 01:18:15.371
The same thing happened 29 years ago.
I might just as well live in a temple.

01:18:15.372 --> 01:18:18.124
I'll wager you never
got my nose sharpened.

01:18:18.125 --> 01:18:23.785
I would like to know what it is you do that
makes you so tired. I noticed you're...

01:18:32.473 --> 01:18:35.224
Here. Hey.

01:18:35.225 --> 01:18:39.103
I wish to throw myself to the lions.
Where do I go?

01:18:39.104 --> 01:18:41.606
- Pompeii?
- I beg your pardon?

01:18:41.607 --> 01:18:44.942
No performance here today.
Gladiators are just training.

01:18:44.943 --> 01:18:47.816
- Training?
- Training.

01:18:49.031 --> 01:18:52.864
Come on, you miserable slave, move!

01:18:53.786 --> 01:18:56.287
- Here you are, lot four.
- Straight in.

01:18:56.288 --> 01:18:57.914
All right.

01:18:57.915 --> 01:19:00.833
Move, you slaves. Move.

01:19:00.834 --> 01:19:02.335
Move!

01:19:02.336 --> 01:19:05.171
Oh, dear, come along. Keep moving.

01:19:05.172 --> 01:19:08.466
Over there. Get in line. In line.

01:19:08.467 --> 01:19:11.505
How are you? All right?
Had a good day?

01:19:13.388 --> 01:19:15.890
Hero! Master Hero! Wait here.

01:19:15.891 --> 01:19:18.518
Hey! We're closed to
members of the public.

01:19:18.519 --> 01:19:21.145
That young man that went
in, I must see him.

01:19:21.146 --> 01:19:26.604
You'll see him. They should be
bringing him out any minute.

01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:38.827
- Now, the secret of the action...
- Hm?

01:19:39.289 --> 01:19:43.501
The secret of the action is in the wrist.
You see, it's got to flow.

01:19:43.502 --> 01:19:46.041
You're jerking.

01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:53.219
No, no. You see, think of it
as an extension of your arm.

01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:57.056
You tightened up, didn't you?
You're worrying about it too much.

01:19:57.057 --> 01:20:02.717
Try and just do a couple without
thinking about it, eh? Go on.

01:20:03.814 --> 01:20:05.231
Ah!

01:20:05.232 --> 01:20:07.400
That even felt better, didn't it?

01:20:07.401 --> 01:20:10.111
- I'm always better in trainin'.
- Yes.

01:20:10.112 --> 01:20:13.865
Now, don't worry,
don't worry. Just...

01:20:13.866 --> 01:20:15.616
No, no. Relax, relax.

01:20:15.617 --> 01:20:19.818
You see, he sort of... went...
Very strange. Right.

01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:32.297
No. Wrist jerk again.

01:20:38.056 --> 01:20:43.551
Oh, much better, yes. You've
got a natural swing, you know.

01:20:44.897 --> 01:20:47.935
Uh, please. Do you mind?

01:20:49.943 --> 01:20:52.236
No. That's a nasty, messy one.

01:20:52.237 --> 01:20:56.240
That fellow whistling put you off.
Here's the last one.

01:20:56.241 --> 01:21:00.661
Never mind. Let's see if we can put
this one straight into Nero's box.

01:21:00.662 --> 01:21:01.788
Psst!

01:21:01.789 --> 01:21:04.577
Uh, please, please.

01:21:07.795 --> 01:21:09.837
Do you mind?

01:21:13.717 --> 01:21:17.637
Still jerking the wrist.

01:21:17.638 --> 01:21:19.013
Hero, Hero.

01:21:19.014 --> 01:21:24.472
Philia's alive. She's at the temple of
virgins. Go, go now. Save her. Go. Go.

01:21:59.596 --> 01:22:01.923
Hyargh!

01:22:07.146 --> 01:22:08.808
Give it!

01:22:10.107 --> 01:22:12.942
Yah, yah. Yah!

01:22:12.943 --> 01:22:14.225
Hyargh!

01:22:42.014 --> 01:22:44.091
Come!

01:22:47.936 --> 01:22:49.979
Oh! Miles!

01:22:49.980 --> 01:22:52.971
There they are!

01:23:16.256 --> 01:23:23.346
And now a moment of silence before
our daughter starts her final voyage.

01:23:23.347 --> 01:23:26.005
Psst! Philia!

01:23:26.183 --> 01:23:27.391
Huh?

01:23:27.392 --> 01:23:28.684
Here, here.

01:23:28.685 --> 01:23:31.854
Hero. My Hero.

01:23:31.855 --> 01:23:34.565
No mortal sounds must interfere.

01:23:34.566 --> 01:23:38.486
But I thought he was dead.
I must go to him. I love him.

01:23:38.487 --> 01:23:40.905
- Yes. Now.
- So be it.

01:23:40.906 --> 01:23:43.446
Run along, child.

01:23:43.867 --> 01:23:48.116
Bring another victim to the altar.

01:24:24.491 --> 01:24:27.114
Come on!

01:24:29.621 --> 01:24:33.039
Master Hero, wait!

01:24:51.018 --> 01:24:55.146
Master Hero, wait!
My freedom! You promised!

01:24:55.147 --> 01:24:56.981
Look, there they are.

01:24:56.982 --> 01:25:02.111
Master Hero, wait!
Your parents. I promised!

01:25:02.112 --> 01:25:05.483
Hero, wait! The captain.
I promised!

01:25:05.949 --> 01:25:09.201
Come on!

01:25:37.147 --> 01:25:41.265
The most refreshing
climate in the world.

01:25:48.367 --> 01:25:50.610
Look out!

01:26:20.983 --> 01:26:23.522
Come back!

01:26:57.519 --> 01:27:00.938
Take that! And that! And that!

01:27:00.939 --> 01:27:03.847
Get away!

01:27:08.113 --> 01:27:10.820
Duck!

01:27:12.201 --> 01:27:13.946
Whoa!

01:27:14.870 --> 01:27:16.615
Help. Help!

01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:36.307
Jump. Jump!

01:27:36.308 --> 01:27:38.601
Jump. Jump!

01:27:38.602 --> 01:27:40.561
Jump!

01:27:42.856 --> 01:27:46.859
Hold me close.
It makes me feel so strong.

01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:51.524
Personally, I'm not quite
ready to make up yet. What?

01:27:51.615 --> 01:27:55.698
You want her, you take her.

01:28:03.502 --> 01:28:06.125
That's far enough! Look out!

01:28:09.091 --> 01:28:10.925
Oh, Hero, help!

01:28:10.926 --> 01:28:13.751
I'm awfully sorry. Thank you.

01:28:23.439 --> 01:28:27.058
Oh, you breed of Eve!

01:28:31.947 --> 01:28:34.653
Darling! Hit me again, darling.

01:29:01.852 --> 01:29:04.309
No, no!

01:29:24.082 --> 01:29:27.038
Wait! Stop!

01:30:04.373 --> 01:30:05.498
Whoa!

01:30:05.499 --> 01:30:08.157
No, no! Don't whoa!

01:30:23.016 --> 01:30:28.262
Right! Now back to Rome for a quick
wedding and some slow executions.

01:30:48.333 --> 01:30:53.087
You, slave! You will torn apart
by a team of wild horses, slowly,

01:30:53.088 --> 01:30:56.757
to the plaudits of my troops and
the amusement of the children.

01:30:56.758 --> 01:30:59.302
But you, my dear,
have nothing to fear.

01:30:59.303 --> 01:31:02.847
For, though you fled from me,
I have the greatness to forgive.

01:31:02.848 --> 01:31:07.013
I, too, can forgive.
No one can part us now.

01:31:09.271 --> 01:31:14.896
Show me the swine who did that and
I'll break every bone in his body.

01:31:18.864 --> 01:31:21.072
Third time around.

01:31:26.914 --> 01:31:29.453
Pardon me, madam.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:33.620
The gaggle! My precious.

01:31:33.629 --> 01:31:35.797
My beautiful.

01:31:35.798 --> 01:31:37.465
My sweet.

01:31:37.466 --> 01:31:41.135
Why do older men find
me so attractive?

01:31:41.136 --> 01:31:43.888
The family ring. My daughter.

01:31:43.889 --> 01:31:46.891
- My virgin?
- I am not a virgin.

01:31:46.892 --> 01:31:48.643
Those filthy pirates!

01:31:48.644 --> 01:31:52.560
And I am not your daughter.
I'm an Etruscan dancer.

01:31:54.233 --> 01:31:55.983
- You are my virgin.
- My daughter.

01:31:55.984 --> 01:31:57.860
- My virgin!
- My...

01:31:57.861 --> 01:32:00.238
Ye gods! The eunuch.

01:32:00.239 --> 01:32:03.783
- My daughter, a eunuch?
- Soldier, seize that man!

01:32:03.784 --> 01:32:05.743
Captain, I can explain.

01:32:05.744 --> 01:32:08.121
- This can't be she.
- What?

01:32:08.122 --> 01:32:10.873
The leper. Unclean! Unclean!

01:32:10.874 --> 01:32:14.377
I am no leper, and no woman.

01:32:14.378 --> 01:32:17.421
I, sire, am Marcus Lycus. Hold.

01:32:17.422 --> 01:32:21.007
Here. Here is your virgin.

01:32:22.177 --> 01:32:24.095
And worth the waiting for.

01:32:24.096 --> 01:32:28.516
I don't understand it.
The ring, the gaggle of geese.

01:32:28.517 --> 01:32:34.063
What did you say, old man? I have worn
this ring since I was a foundling child.

01:32:34.064 --> 01:32:36.441
- My son!
- Father!

01:32:36.442 --> 01:32:39.026
You've grown.

01:32:39.027 --> 01:32:43.030
- Are these many geese a gaggle?
- How long have you had that?

01:32:43.031 --> 01:32:45.992
Since... I don't know
when I've had this since.

01:32:45.993 --> 01:32:48.161
- My daughter!
- My sister.

01:32:48.162 --> 01:32:50.413
- My courtesan.
- My maid.

01:32:50.414 --> 01:32:52.748
- My brother-in-law.
- My Gymnasia.

01:32:52.749 --> 01:32:56.002
Oh, no. No! That girl I still own.

01:32:56.003 --> 01:32:58.796
One moment. I take it your
daughter was freeborn?

01:32:58.797 --> 01:33:00.673
- Without a doubt.
- Lycus,

01:33:00.674 --> 01:33:04.594
we all know the penalty for
selling a freeborn citizen.

01:33:04.595 --> 01:33:07.013
Seize him.

01:33:07.014 --> 01:33:08.973
Careful. I'm a bleeder.

01:33:08.974 --> 01:33:12.685
However, he has not only given me
a marvellous wedding present...

01:33:12.686 --> 01:33:14.854
a wife, especially a silent one...

01:33:14.855 --> 01:33:17.857
he's also promised me
10,000 minae as a dowry.

01:33:17.858 --> 01:33:19.859
Ten...

01:33:19.860 --> 01:33:22.069
No.

01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:24.614
