Hey, douche bag.
Are you doing anything cool?

00:41.541 --> 00:42.415
Hey, Eric.

00:42.625 --> 00:44.499
I'm just looking at a video
of bird eggs that I took.

00:44.708 --> 00:47.082
Oh, God damn it.
Nobody's doing anything cool.

00:47.291 --> 00:49.290
I'm so bored.
Everything is so stupid.

00:49.500 --> 00:51.040
I don't know.
This bird nest is pretty neat-o.

00:51.250 --> 00:52.040
No, it isn't.

00:52.250 --> 00:53.540
My dad and I shot it yesterday
at the lake.

00:53.750 --> 00:54.374
That's stupid.

00:54.583 --> 00:55.832
You can see the mama bird
fly in.

00:56.041 --> 00:56.832
I'm dying of boredom.

00:57.041 --> 00:58.749
We took all kinds of videos
with his drone.

00:58.958 --> 01:00.040
What did you say?!

01:00.250 --> 01:01.790
You know,
those drone thingies.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.207
You can make it fly anywhere
and shoot video and stuff.

01:04.416 --> 01:06.832
Your dad has a fucking drone?!

01:09.833 --> 01:11.207
Whoa!

01:11.416 --> 01:12.624
It can fly
like a quarter mile away

01:12.833 --> 01:13.749
from whoever's controlling it.

01:13.958 --> 01:15.665
And it can take video the entire
time right to your phone.

01:15.875 --> 01:16.999
Don't touch the propellers.

01:17.208 --> 01:19.499
You want to take it out
for a spin?

01:19.708 --> 01:21.332
Are you crazy?
This is my dad's drone.

01:21.541 --> 01:22.624
Do you have any idea
how much fun

01:22.833 --> 01:23.749
we could have with this thing?

01:23.958 --> 01:24.999
We can spy on everyone.

01:25.208 --> 01:26.999
My dad says it's not for spying
on people.

01:27.208 --> 01:28.457
Butters,
that's all drones are for.

01:28.666 --> 01:29.832
If we use it
for a couple minutes tonight,

01:30.041 --> 01:30.832
your dad will never know.

01:31.041 --> 01:32.665
Oh, he'll know.
You can hear it take off.

01:32.875 --> 01:34.374
Okay. Good idea.
We'll take it over to my house.

01:34.583 --> 01:35.999
Come over after dark.
And don't tell anyone.

01:36.208 --> 01:37.832
- No, Eric. I don't want to --
- MR. - Butters!

01:38.041 --> 01:40.165
Oh, shit, it's your dad.
Go, go, go!

01:40.375 --> 01:41.874
I'll see you later
at my house.

01:42.083 --> 01:43.915
Butters, are you home?

01:44.125 --> 01:45.874
Coming, Dad!

01:50.000 --> 01:52.957
- Butters, is that you?
- Yeah, it's me.

01:53.166 --> 01:55.332
Nobody followed you, right?
You didn't tell anybody?

01:55.541 --> 01:57.249
- Of course not!
- All right. Come in.

01:57.458 --> 01:59.874
Kenny's here.
I told him all about it.

02:00.083 --> 02:01.624
What?!
You said nobody would know!

02:01.833 --> 02:02.624
It's just Kenny.

02:02.833 --> 02:04.332
Like we're not gonna tell Kenny
we have a fucking drone.

02:04.541 --> 02:05.749
Come on, Butters.
All right. Come on, guys.

02:05.958 --> 02:07.165
I think I have this thing
figured out.

02:16.083 --> 02:18.874
Dude, no way!
This thing is so epic.

02:24.708 --> 02:25.707
Be careful
of the power lines!

02:25.916 --> 02:27.457
Dude, look!
There's everyone's backyards!

02:29.416 --> 02:30.374
Dude, there's Craig's house.

02:30.583 --> 02:32.040
- That's Craig's house.
- Mrph rmhmhm rm!

02:32.250 --> 02:33.832
Okay, uh, maybe that's enough.

02:34.041 --> 02:36.207
Oh, dude, look.
There's Craig.

02:37.958 --> 02:39.249
Craig's mom is taking off
her clothes.

02:39.458 --> 02:40.790
- Mrph rmhmhm!
- Let me see!

02:41.000 --> 02:42.332
Check it out, you guys.
She's taking off --

02:42.541 --> 02:44.040
Oh, my God.
We've got full bush.

02:44.250 --> 02:45.082
Mrph rmhmhm!

02:45.291 --> 02:46.749
Geez!

02:46.958 --> 02:48.290
- This thing is recording, right?
- Rm!

02:48.500 --> 02:49.999
Dude, that is Craig's mom's bush
right there.

02:50.208 --> 02:51.790
Wait.
Wait, what's that?

02:53.250 --> 02:54.790
Oh, shit, dude.
Bail, bail!

02:55.000 --> 02:56.124
What do I do?!

02:56.333 --> 02:58.457
- His dad sees you!
- I don't know what to do!

02:58.666 --> 03:00.499
Fly back to the house,
stupid!

03:03.208 --> 03:04.915
You got a problem, Stotch?

03:05.125 --> 03:06.290
What are you talking about?

03:06.500 --> 03:07.874
You know
what I'm talking about.

03:08.083 --> 03:09.582
There was a drone
spying on my wife,

03:09.791 --> 03:11.749
and you're the only person
I know with a drone.

03:11.958 --> 03:15.082
Now, hold on.
I am a drone-hobby enthusiast.

03:15.291 --> 03:16.832
I would never use my drone
in a way

03:17.041 --> 03:19.249
that contradicts the
drone-hobbyist code of conduct.

03:19.458 --> 03:21.749
Horse shit! Your drone's out
there flying around right now.

03:21.958 --> 03:24.040
I assure you my drone
is sitting in the garage.

03:24.250 --> 03:25.249
I'll show you.

03:27.333 --> 03:28.374
There. You see?

03:28.583 --> 03:30.665
It's right there.

03:30.875 --> 03:33.040
So -- So you flew it
back here in time.

03:33.250 --> 03:34.749
I swear I didn't fly it.

03:34.958 --> 03:37.707
Well, these things don't just
fly themselves, do they?

03:37.916 --> 03:38.874
They ought to be illegal.

03:39.083 --> 03:42.749
I better not find out
it was your drone!

03:52.125 --> 03:53.082
Butters?

03:54.750 --> 03:56.540
Oh. H-Hey, Dad.

03:56.750 --> 03:58.374
Butters,
did you hear the drone

03:58.583 --> 04:00.207
making any sounds
in the garage?

04:00.416 --> 04:02.999
Uh, oh, no, Dad.
I've just been sleeping.

04:03.208 --> 04:05.124
Why do you ask?

04:05.333 --> 04:06.874
Nothing, son.
It's nothing.

04:07.083 --> 04:08.790
Get back to sleep, pal.
Love you.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.332
Love you, too, Dad.

04:16.041 --> 04:17.082
All right, all right.
Shh. Kenny.

04:17.291 --> 04:18.082
Here come Stan and Kyle.

04:18.291 --> 04:19.957
Remember -- Not a word
about this to anyone.

04:20.166 --> 04:21.874
- Mrph rmhmhm rm.
- Not a word, Kenny.

04:22.083 --> 04:22.540
Mrph rm!

04:22.750 --> 04:24.249
Yeah, but, seriously,
it's like there's no real thing

04:24.458 --> 04:25.249
to grab onto, you know?

04:25.458 --> 04:27.040
Yeah, I don't even know
if I'm gonna watch it anymore.

04:27.250 --> 04:28.207
I know.

04:28.416 --> 04:31.207
- Hey, guys.
- 'Sup?

04:31.416 --> 04:33.540
Ehh...

04:33.750 --> 04:35.790
Ehhhh...

04:36.000 --> 04:37.832
You guys want to see
Craig's mom's bush?!

04:38.041 --> 04:38.957
Rm!
Mrph rmhmhm rm!

04:39.166 --> 04:39.957
What?

04:40.166 --> 04:41.499
Somebody, I guess,
was spying on Craig's mom,

04:41.708 --> 04:42.707
and they got pictures
of her bush,

04:42.916 --> 04:43.874
and it's like --
it's like a yeti.

04:44.083 --> 04:44.999
You guys want
to check it out?

04:45.208 --> 04:46.832
- Rm!
- That's horrible.

04:47.041 --> 04:48.457
If that's true,
I don't want to see it.

04:48.666 --> 04:50.124
You don't want to see
Craig's mom's bush?

04:50.333 --> 04:52.124
Not if somebody took pictures
without her knowing.

04:52.333 --> 04:53.124
Let me see.

04:53.333 --> 04:56.124
Locked and loaded.
Full metal bush, bro.

04:56.333 --> 04:58.707
How did you get that
on your phone?

04:58.916 --> 05:00.374
Oh, um, uh...

05:00.583 --> 05:01.874
Kenny? Um...

05:02.083 --> 05:02.915
Oh, it's on the Internet.

05:03.125 --> 05:04.374
Yeah, I just downloaded it
off the Internet.

05:04.583 --> 05:06.040
Nobody knows who took it.
Huh, Kenny?

05:06.250 --> 05:07.749
- Rm-rmh.
- That's terrible.

05:07.958 --> 05:10.290
I know, right?
Now everyone's gonna see it.

05:12.416 --> 05:13.582
Hey, Craig.

05:13.791 --> 05:15.124
Have you checked out
the Internet lately?

05:16.666 --> 05:17.582
What are you
talking about?

05:17.791 --> 05:18.749
Ohh, nothing.

05:18.958 --> 05:22.290
It's just that you might want to
invest in some hedge clippers.

05:24.666 --> 05:26.749
- For what?
- Ohh, nothing.

05:26.958 --> 05:27.790
You just might want to

05:28.000 --> 05:30.457
hire Tarzan to do some
landscaping work for your mom.

05:32.625 --> 05:34.124
What the heck
are you doing?!

05:34.333 --> 05:35.624
Whoa, Butters.
Chillax, bro.

05:35.833 --> 05:37.540
Why did you put Craig's mom's
bush on the Internet?!

05:37.750 --> 05:38.207
Butters --

05:38.416 --> 05:40.040
You promised me we wouldn't
get into trouble!

05:40.250 --> 05:41.790
Now everyone is gonna know
what we were doing!

05:42.000 --> 05:43.457
Butters, I had to, okay?

05:43.666 --> 05:45.040
I had to put it
on the Internet.

05:45.250 --> 05:45.707
Why?!

05:45.916 --> 05:48.249
Because Stan saw the video
on my phone, all right?

05:48.458 --> 05:50.957
If the video is only on my
phone, then clearly we did it.

05:51.166 --> 05:52.374
If we downloaded it
off the Internet,

05:52.583 --> 05:53.624
then anyone
could have done it.

05:53.833 --> 05:55.040
I should have never
listened to you.

05:55.250 --> 05:56.790
I should have known
this would get out of hand.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.707
Butters, don't start playing
the blame game here, okay?

05:58.916 --> 06:00.124
You and Kenny
are just as responsible.

06:00.333 --> 06:01.540
And the next time
you want to shove me,

06:01.750 --> 06:03.749
just remember
I'm covering your ass.

06:11.750 --> 06:12.582
Hi, everyone.

06:12.791 --> 06:14.124
For those of you
I don't know as well,

06:14.333 --> 06:16.124
my name is Roger Donovan,
and, uh,

06:16.333 --> 06:18.415
just like you, I'm pretty upset
about what's going on

06:18.625 --> 06:19.415
in our neighborhood.

06:19.625 --> 06:20.957
How are these drones legal?

06:21.166 --> 06:22.124
My wife didn't deserve

06:22.333 --> 06:24.499
to be splayed all over
the Internet like that.

06:24.708 --> 06:25.624
Yes, well, luckily,

06:25.833 --> 06:27.749
nobody's watched the video,
of course.

06:29.666 --> 06:31.207
But the fact is
that these drones

06:31.416 --> 06:32.665
are only getting more popular.

06:32.875 --> 06:35.915
I mean, anyone can get a drone
off Amazon for 200 bucks,

06:36.125 --> 06:37.290
and there's no laws

06:37.500 --> 06:39.624
and the whole thing
is pretty damn hairy.

06:39.833 --> 06:42.290
Oh. Oh.
God, I'm sorry, Laura.

06:42.500 --> 06:46.207
You know I meant the situation
is pretty hairy, right?

06:46.416 --> 06:48.207
Nothing to do
with you personally.

06:48.416 --> 06:50.624
I mean, how would I even know?
I didn't see it.

06:50.833 --> 06:51.999
Um...

06:52.208 --> 06:54.374
Look, we're all here
because what happened to Laura

06:54.583 --> 06:55.665
could happen to any of us.

06:55.875 --> 06:57.207
There's nobody regulating
these drones,

06:57.416 --> 06:58.540
and if we don't do
something now,

06:58.750 --> 07:00.415
we're gonna be up to our navels
with bush.

07:00.625 --> 07:02.415
Oh! Uh, up to our necks
in trouble.

07:02.625 --> 07:03.957
Sorry!

07:05.416 --> 07:08.207
You know, it used to be
called "natural."

07:08.416 --> 07:10.165
Completely shaving bald
down there

07:10.375 --> 07:11.707
used to be the weird thing.

07:11.916 --> 07:12.707
It's okay, honey.

07:12.916 --> 07:15.374
But now, because I choose
not to let society

07:15.583 --> 07:18.040
dictate how hairy my vagina
should be...

07:18.250 --> 07:19.040
Ew.

07:19.250 --> 07:21.457
...I'm labeled as some kind
of freaking monster.

07:21.666 --> 07:22.707
A-A-And that's the point.

07:22.916 --> 07:24.874
I mean, we all have things
about ourselves

07:25.083 --> 07:26.832
that are embarrassing
that -- that --

07:27.041 --> 07:29.374
I'm not embarrassed about it!
It's natural!

07:29.583 --> 07:30.999
It's a lot of natural.

07:31.208 --> 07:33.457
Look, look, why we're here

07:33.666 --> 07:35.999
is because it's gonna take
all of us --

07:36.208 --> 07:37.499
a neighborhood watch --

07:37.708 --> 07:40.207
to make sure that our community
stays safe.

07:40.416 --> 07:42.374
Yeah, but how can we keep
that close a watch

07:42.583 --> 07:43.665
on the whole neighborhood?

07:43.875 --> 07:45.082
It's simple.

07:53.791 --> 07:55.582
Oh, yeah.
This is gonna work great.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.207
Are you happy now?

08:05.416 --> 08:06.665
What?

08:06.875 --> 08:09.707
Is -- Is this --
You think this is cool?

08:09.916 --> 08:11.707
What does that
have to do with me?

08:11.916 --> 08:13.624
See, when you start invading
people's privacy,

08:13.833 --> 08:14.707
thinking it's harmless

08:14.916 --> 08:17.957
to put up pictures of them
they didn't want up, Kenny,

08:18.166 --> 08:19.124
you start a domino effect

08:19.333 --> 08:22.165
that eventually screws
everything up for everybody.

08:22.375 --> 08:24.249
Kenny has no idea what
you're talking about, dude.

08:24.458 --> 08:25.082
I was in the bathroom

08:25.291 --> 08:26.415
when you were talking
to Butters, Cartman.

08:26.625 --> 08:27.540
- I know you --
- You were what?

08:27.750 --> 08:29.582
- I was in the bathroom --
- You were spying on me?!

08:29.791 --> 08:31.874
No. I was taking a crap,
and I heard you guys talking.

08:32.083 --> 08:34.165
But you didn't say anything?
That's fucking spying, Kyle!

08:34.375 --> 08:34.999
How is that spying?!

08:35.208 --> 08:36.874
You were listening but we didn't
know you were there?

08:37.083 --> 08:37.874
How is that not spying?!

08:38.083 --> 08:39.499
You're a dick!
You're a spying dick!

08:39.708 --> 08:41.665
And now you want to lecture
Kenny about spying?!

08:41.875 --> 08:44.082
Fuck you, hypocrite dick spy.

08:49.083 --> 08:50.874
Hello.
Can I help you?

08:51.083 --> 08:52.874
Yes.
I'd like to return this drone.

08:53.083 --> 08:55.040
You want to return it?

08:55.250 --> 08:57.540
Yes, I'm --
I'm not into the hobby anymore.

08:57.750 --> 08:59.957
The hobby of flying drones
is new and exciting.

09:00.166 --> 09:01.499
How can you not be into it?

09:01.708 --> 09:03.874
Look, something's wrong
with it.

09:04.083 --> 09:09.165
It does things.
It flies by itself.

09:09.375 --> 09:12.124
Uh, no.
Somebody has to control it.

09:12.333 --> 09:13.415
You don't understand.

09:13.625 --> 09:14.707
It was in the garage,

09:14.916 --> 09:16.874
and the battery
was fully charged.

09:17.083 --> 09:20.124
Someone said they'd seen it
flying around, so I checked.

09:20.333 --> 09:23.165
The battery was half empty.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.332
I'm sorry,
but we don't do returns.

09:28.541 --> 09:30.790
Please, I just want another
hobby to get enthused about.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.832
Sir, did you try looking
at the SD card?

09:33.041 --> 09:34.665
All the video gets recorded
to that,

09:34.875 --> 09:36.874
so you could probably determine
who flew it.

09:37.083 --> 09:38.415
You think I didn't try that?

09:38.625 --> 09:40.707
I pulled out the SD card.

09:40.916 --> 09:42.499
It was all erased.

09:42.708 --> 09:45.124
Somehow it erased everything!

09:45.333 --> 09:48.457
Uh, sir, did you consider

09:48.666 --> 09:50.874
that your son
might have done that?

09:51.083 --> 09:53.040
No. It's impossible.

09:53.250 --> 09:56.207
He's not allowed to fly it
without my supervision.

10:10.583 --> 10:12.582
Oh, for God's sakes!

10:14.958 --> 10:17.165
God damn it!
Get the hell out of here!

10:17.375 --> 10:18.707
That does it!

10:18.916 --> 10:20.374
You people
have to do something.

10:20.583 --> 10:23.499
You're the law, and these things
need to be illegal.

10:23.708 --> 10:25.290
But they aren't illegal,
Mr. Tucker.

10:25.500 --> 10:26.874
Our privacy was invaded,

10:27.083 --> 10:28.874
and now there are kids at school
making music videos

10:29.083 --> 10:30.207
with the footage of my wife.

10:30.416 --> 10:31.874
Have you seen
what they're doing?!

10:32.083 --> 10:33.749
No, no. None of us
watched the video.

10:33.958 --> 10:35.499
But if we did,
we could handle it.

10:35.708 --> 10:36.582
We're police officers.

10:36.791 --> 10:38.749
We see sickening things
like that every day.

10:38.958 --> 10:41.540
We understand the humiliation
your wife has gone through,

10:41.750 --> 10:42.874
Mr. Tucker, but we don't --

10:43.083 --> 10:45.624
I haven't been "humiliated."
I've been wronged.

10:45.833 --> 10:47.082
We are here
to ask for your help.

10:47.291 --> 10:48.832
Now are you gonna
help us or not?

10:49.041 --> 10:50.290
Well, that'd probably
be best left

10:50.500 --> 10:52.332
to a professional
hair-removal company.

10:52.541 --> 10:53.915
Or perhaps a forest ranger.

10:54.125 --> 10:56.915
Help us with the drones
spying on us!

10:57.125 --> 11:00.374
All right, all right.
We'll do everything we can.

11:06.875 --> 11:08.374
Are you out of your mind?!

11:08.583 --> 11:09.540
- What are you doing?!
- Butters --

11:09.750 --> 11:11.165
Why would you turn
Craig's mom's bush

11:11.375 --> 11:12.540
into a music video
starring us?!

11:12.750 --> 11:13.624
Because, Butters --

11:13.833 --> 11:15.915
Why can't you leave it alone?
Why can't you just stop?!

11:16.125 --> 11:19.915
Because, Butters,
Kyle was spying on us, okay?

11:21.375 --> 11:22.540
Kyle was spying on us,

11:22.750 --> 11:23.790
and he knows
that we put the video

11:24.000 --> 11:25.290
of Craig's mom
on the Internet.

11:25.500 --> 11:26.374
He found out everything.

11:26.583 --> 11:27.874
That's why I had
to make another video.

11:28.083 --> 11:28.707
Why?!

11:28.916 --> 11:31.207
Because when Kyle says he heard
us say we made the video,

11:31.416 --> 11:33.499
we can say we were talking
about this video.

11:33.708 --> 11:35.374
"Oh, thank you, Eric.
That's pretty smart.

11:35.583 --> 11:37.624
I really owe you one."

11:37.833 --> 11:39.082
That poor lady.

11:39.291 --> 11:42.040
Her vagina is everywhere.
Poor Craig.

11:42.250 --> 11:45.124
Butters, we live in a world
where privacy is gone, okay?

11:45.333 --> 11:46.749
It's -- It's just gone, bud.

11:46.958 --> 11:49.082
Your wiener, my balls --
They're public domain.

11:49.291 --> 11:50.415
You can get on the Internet
right now

11:50.625 --> 11:52.249
and look at that chick from
"Hunger Games" ' butt-hole.

11:52.458 --> 11:53.665
We can either all freak out
about it,

11:53.875 --> 11:56.332
or we can just calm down
because, honestly,

11:56.541 --> 11:58.624
I'm getting a little sick
of covering your ass.

12:08.166 --> 12:10.832
Gerald's watching
"Housewives of Atlanta."

12:11.041 --> 12:13.749
You're supposed to be keeping
watch on the neighborhood.

12:13.958 --> 12:16.957
I am.
Let's see what Nelson's doing.

12:34.000 --> 12:34.749
Oh, shit!

12:37.916 --> 12:39.707
Dude, neighborhood watch!
I'm neighborhood watch!

12:44.583 --> 12:45.540
I've been shot!

12:47.875 --> 12:50.040
No! No!

12:50.250 --> 12:52.707
Shock and outrage
all over the state tonight

12:52.916 --> 12:54.499
after an on-duty police drone

12:54.708 --> 12:57.624
chased and shot down
an unarmed civilian drone.

12:57.833 --> 13:01.499
And worst of all, yes,
the civilian drone was black.

13:01.708 --> 13:04.457
What gives them the right
to shoot down our drones?!

13:04.666 --> 13:06.207
I wasn't doing anything wrong!

13:06.416 --> 13:09.290
This is a complete outrage
to drone owners everywhere!

13:09.500 --> 13:11.374
It was about yea big.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.540
I mean, the hair on it
was out to here,

13:13.750 --> 13:16.999
and then it had another trail of
hair down from her belly button.

13:17.208 --> 13:19.332
I mean the -- the drone.

13:19.541 --> 13:21.999
Yeah, that's what I saw.
That -- That's all I saw.

13:22.208 --> 13:23.124
While police claim

13:23.333 --> 13:25.415
they were only following
standard protocol,

13:25.625 --> 13:27.207
the drone owners
are banding together

13:27.416 --> 13:29.124
and holding a candlelight vigil.

13:42.583 --> 13:45.290
Please disperse.

13:45.500 --> 13:48.790
Candles on top of drones
are a fire hazard.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.457
Return to your garages.

13:51.666 --> 13:53.415
What the hell are
these police drones doing?

13:53.625 --> 13:55.124
We can't protest now?

13:55.333 --> 13:56.249
Just hover, honey.

13:56.458 --> 13:58.124
They can't do anything
if we're just hovering.

14:01.958 --> 14:03.790
Randy, we need to talk.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.207
Okay.

14:05.416 --> 14:07.040
Inside!

14:07.250 --> 14:10.290
I've been going over it
and over it in my head.

14:10.500 --> 14:11.832
I thought Butters and I
were alone,

14:12.041 --> 14:13.790
but then I saw you
on the news.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.957
Another drone-hobby enthusiast

14:16.166 --> 14:17.624
whose drone was blamed
for something

14:17.833 --> 14:19.957
the enthusiast
didn't recall doing.

14:20.166 --> 14:22.999
Randy, this is very important.

14:23.208 --> 14:25.415
Is it possible
that you did something

14:25.625 --> 14:27.332
contrary to the proper
code of conduct

14:27.541 --> 14:29.457
for drone-flying
enthusiasts?

14:29.666 --> 14:31.582
No. I didn't.

14:33.666 --> 14:35.790
I thought
it was just my drone.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.457
But I think
it might be all of them.

14:37.666 --> 14:38.707
What might be?

14:38.916 --> 14:40.332
Once you eliminate
the impossible,

14:40.541 --> 14:42.540
whatever remains,
no matter how improbable,

14:42.750 --> 14:43.624
must be the truth.

14:43.833 --> 14:44.624
Our drone flew.

14:44.833 --> 14:47.457
The battery was drained.
The SD card was erased.

14:47.666 --> 14:49.790
Butters was the only other
person who had access to it.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.290
Butters can't use the drone
without my supervision.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.915
So where does that leave us,
Randy?

14:55.125 --> 14:56.499
Drones are spooky?

14:56.708 --> 15:00.124
If they have minds of their own,
they're more than spooky.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.374
I don't know about you,

15:02.583 --> 15:06.707
but I'm starting to feel pretty
unenthused about this hobby.

15:06.916 --> 15:09.749
The town of South Park has
become a hotbed of tension

15:09.958 --> 15:12.040
with civilians lashing out
at police.

15:12.250 --> 15:15.249
After police used excessive
force at a peaceful protest,

15:15.458 --> 15:18.165
the town has now broken out
into full-scale riots.

15:23.708 --> 15:26.582
As the people of South Park
continue to protest,

15:26.791 --> 15:27.790
the South Park Police

15:28.000 --> 15:30.082
are now ordering
a mandatory reverse curfew.

15:30.291 --> 15:32.874
The governor has asked for help
from the National Guard

15:33.083 --> 15:34.249
to bring order to the town.

15:53.666 --> 15:55.749
Tonight on an all-new "20/20,"

15:55.958 --> 15:58.582
a town in crisis
over the matter of privacy.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.124
Now, for the first time,

16:00.333 --> 16:04.082
we sit down and talk to the mom
behind the bush.

16:04.291 --> 16:06.290
You've become
sort of a poster child

16:06.500 --> 16:08.207
for privacy and drone issues.

16:08.416 --> 16:10.082
I don't think anyone
wants to live in a world

16:10.291 --> 16:11.540
where police drones
are monitoring

16:11.750 --> 16:12.582
neighborhood-watch drones.

16:12.791 --> 16:14.332
I mean, where does it stop?

16:14.541 --> 16:19.207
It just keeps going on and on,
kind of like your...

16:19.416 --> 16:22.207
I mean,
it just goes outside

16:22.416 --> 16:25.165
what most people
would call acceptable.

16:27.541 --> 16:30.290
Have you ever seen pictures
of naked women before 2005?

16:30.500 --> 16:32.207
- It's not that weird.
- It's okay, honey.

16:32.416 --> 16:34.582
I didn't see the video.
I don't believe in doing that.

16:34.791 --> 16:36.415
But, uh, I'm just saying

16:36.625 --> 16:42.374
that this situation
in your town is u-unwieldy?

16:45.250 --> 16:47.624
Please do not adjust
your televisions.

16:47.833 --> 16:48.749
What is that?

16:48.958 --> 16:50.874
My name is
Stephen Willis Stotch.

16:51.083 --> 16:54.999
The drone that took the video
of Craig's mom was my drone.

16:55.208 --> 16:56.832
I didn't want to believe it,

16:57.041 --> 16:59.207
but they do things
without us knowing.

16:59.416 --> 17:00.665
At this point,

17:00.875 --> 17:04.082
I have completely lost
all enthusiasm for the hobby.

17:04.291 --> 17:06.665
All of you with drones,
please listen to me.

17:06.875 --> 17:09.249
Three days ago,
my drone recorded a video

17:09.458 --> 17:11.749
that something uploaded
to the Internet.

17:11.958 --> 17:13.374
We all were told
to respectfully

17:13.583 --> 17:14.874
not watch the video.

17:15.083 --> 17:19.915
But on the page,
it has over 300 million views.

17:20.125 --> 17:24.249
So if none of us watched it,
who did?

17:28.666 --> 17:30.874
We have to find a way
to get rid of them

17:31.083 --> 17:33.249
before they get rid of us.

17:39.625 --> 17:40.624
Oh, hey, Butters.
'Sup?

17:40.833 --> 17:42.957
Do you remember
when I showed you the video

17:43.166 --> 17:44.832
of the little bird eggs?

17:45.041 --> 17:47.832
That's the last time
I felt happy.

17:48.041 --> 17:49.874
Dude, what's the matter?

17:50.083 --> 17:51.624
I have to tell the truth.

17:51.833 --> 17:53.082
I want you and Kenny
to come with me

17:53.291 --> 17:54.999
and tell Craig's mom we're sorry
and that we'll --

17:55.208 --> 17:58.582
Okay, okay, okay. Come inside.
There's drones out here.

17:58.791 --> 18:00.124
I don't want any more
discussions, Eric.

18:00.333 --> 18:01.332
I don't want
any more excuses.

18:01.541 --> 18:02.707
- Butters --
- I just want to end this

18:02.916 --> 18:04.540
so we can take our punishment
and be done with it.

18:04.750 --> 18:05.374
Butters, Butters --

18:05.583 --> 18:06.874
I don't want all
these drones everywhere!

18:07.083 --> 18:08.332
- Nobody does!
- Butters!

18:08.541 --> 18:10.207
All right, all right, Butters.
Fine!

18:10.416 --> 18:14.040
I have a way that we can
get rid of all the drones.

18:14.250 --> 18:15.665
You do?

18:15.875 --> 18:17.499
Yes.
Everyone's sick of it.

18:17.708 --> 18:18.707
It's just that
everyone's waiting

18:18.916 --> 18:19.790
for everyone else to stop.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.040
We can put an end
to it all tonight.

18:21.250 --> 18:22.207
We're just gonna need
one thing.

18:22.416 --> 18:24.165
- What?
- Your dad's drone.

18:24.375 --> 18:26.207
- No! There is no way --
- Butters, Butters, Butters!

18:26.416 --> 18:29.082
Jennifer Lawrence's butt-hole
didn't take a picture of itself.

18:29.291 --> 18:30.374
It started with her, right?

18:30.583 --> 18:33.165
Just like this started with you
spying on birds.

18:33.375 --> 18:34.957
Now, I'm willing to
bail you out of all this,

18:35.166 --> 18:37.874
but I swear
it's the last time, okay?!

18:38.083 --> 18:39.415
Okay.

18:49.791 --> 18:52.915
Time to end this hobby
once and for all.

18:58.250 --> 18:59.457
No.

18:59.666 --> 19:01.165
No!

19:01.375 --> 19:03.040
All right.
We've got power.

19:03.250 --> 19:04.040
Prepare for takeoff.

19:04.250 --> 19:05.540
If this doesn't work,
we're dead.

19:05.750 --> 19:06.582
It'll work, Butters.

19:06.791 --> 19:07.957
If there's one thing
we've learned,

19:08.166 --> 19:10.749
it's that drones can't resist
Craig's mom.

20:19.875 --> 20:22.290
We are here tonight
to pay tribute to a woman

20:22.500 --> 20:24.624
who overcame humiliation,

20:24.833 --> 20:27.707
who rose above the monsters
invading her privacy

20:27.916 --> 20:29.332
and said, "No more!"

20:29.541 --> 20:32.415
Just when it seemed that we were
about to live in a world

20:32.625 --> 20:36.665
controlled by drones,
she did something miraculous.

20:36.875 --> 20:39.207
And someday
our children's children

20:39.416 --> 20:41.165
will still be telling stories

20:41.375 --> 20:43.832
about how Craig's mom
flew through the town

20:44.041 --> 20:45.540
and led all the drones away.
