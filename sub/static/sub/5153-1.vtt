Mm.

01:00.519 --> 01:03.978
- You like the wine?
- Very much.

01:04.147 --> 01:09.142
- Would you like some more?
- Please. No. Here.

01:15.534 --> 01:18.117
You're good.

01:18.620 --> 01:22.284
The wine, candles, the dinner.

01:29.214 --> 01:30.455
What's next?

01:32.467 --> 01:33.924
Um...

01:34.303 --> 01:37.296
Let me set the mood.

01:50.777 --> 01:54.441
Last time I saw a woman drink
like that, she was drowning.

01:54.615 --> 01:58.484
- Did she die?
- I don't know. I was just a lifeguard.

01:59.328 --> 02:03.493
You know, I don't want you
to get the wrong impression...

02:03.665 --> 02:06.123
...that I invited you up here...

02:40.202 --> 02:41.534
I'm getting dizzy! Whoo.

02:42.037 --> 02:47.954
Aww, Markell, get your hand
out of my shirt. Come on, Markell, stop.

02:48.126 --> 02:51.961
- Let's get in the back seat.
- Why can't we just watch the movie?

02:52.214 --> 02:55.378
- It's boring.
- This movie ain't boring, it's good.

02:55.550 --> 02:59.134
- Uhn-uhn.
- Give me a kiss. Give me a kiss.

03:08.730 --> 03:13.065
- Do you love me, baby?
- Of course I love you.

03:13.777 --> 03:17.145
Tell me why.
Tell me why you love me.

03:17.322 --> 03:21.487
- Right now?
- Right now. I wanna know.

03:21.660 --> 03:23.697
Because you're fine.

03:23.912 --> 03:27.701
That's deep. That's real deep.
Because I'm fine.

03:27.874 --> 03:30.207
But I see where you coming from.
Mm-hm.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.247
- Why you tripping?
- I ain't tripping.

03:32.504 --> 03:35.793
Let's get in the back seat
so you can give me some sugar.

03:35.966 --> 03:39.050
Uhn-uhn. Can you get me popcorn?

03:39.219 --> 03:41.051
- I'm hungry.
- Popcorn?

03:41.304 --> 03:46.140
Some popcorn, please?
Something. Jujubes. Go on, please?

03:48.270 --> 03:51.013
- I don't believe this.
- Get me popcorn.

03:51.231 --> 03:54.975
And some Jujubes. And some Bonbons!

04:02.951 --> 04:05.159
Justice, I was just thinking.

04:05.412 --> 04:09.122
The real reason why I love you
is because, when I was in jail...

04:09.541 --> 04:12.249
...you sent me all them nice poems.

04:13.336 --> 04:16.043
I'm gonna get your popcorn.

04:23.597 --> 04:27.307
- Kick him in the head.
- You're worried about nothing.

04:27.559 --> 04:29.266
I'll fuck this fool up.

04:33.023 --> 04:34.480
Damn.

04:34.649 --> 04:39.064
I ain't giving you
no more quarters. Shit!

04:46.244 --> 04:52.081
Is that the motherfucker
that was at the mall the other day?

04:54.628 --> 04:57.041
- Is that him?
- I don't know.

04:59.549 --> 05:03.714
- Look at his face, dude.
- That's not him.

05:03.887 --> 05:08.928
That's him, dude, I'm telling you.
I remember him. That's him.

05:09.559 --> 05:11.016
Yeah. Uh...

05:11.186 --> 05:13.223
Let me get a, uh...

05:13.480 --> 05:18.817
That's that nigga that was talking shit
in front of all his homeboys.

05:19.486 --> 05:22.729
Popcorn and Jujubes.

05:24.115 --> 05:25.526
Shit. Look.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.163
Oh, man. Shit.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.578
You're sick!

05:34.751 --> 05:37.084
- Is that a crime?
- Save it.

06:02.696 --> 06:07.657
I think I just saw those fools
I had beef with last week.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.662
<i>So I shot.</i>

06:13.915 --> 06:17.875
<i>Again, and again, and again.</i>

06:18.503 --> 06:21.996
<i>Oh, it felt so good.</i>

06:23.717 --> 06:27.461
<i>But in the end, I was still horny.</i>

06:28.680 --> 06:32.173
<i>My sweet abyss still existed.</i>

06:42.152 --> 06:45.361
Markell! Markell, get up, baby.

06:45.572 --> 06:50.067
Markell, baby, wake up. Markell!

06:50.243 --> 06:52.235
Somebody help me, please!

06:53.705 --> 06:56.413
Somebody help me!

07:26.988 --> 07:30.572
<i>Alone
Lying, thinking last night</i>

07:30.742 --> 07:33.359
<i>How to find my soul a home</i>

07:33.620 --> 07:38.331
<i>Where water is not thirsty
And bread loaf is not stone</i>

07:38.583 --> 07:42.452
<i>I came up with one thing
And I don't believe I'm wrong</i>

07:42.712 --> 07:47.082
<i>That nobody, but nobody
Can make it out here alone</i>

07:58.853 --> 08:01.687
<i>Alone, all alone</i>

08:01.856 --> 08:05.645
<i>Nobody, but nobody
Can make it out here alone</i>

08:05.819 --> 08:09.403
<i>There are some millionaires
With money they can't use</i>

08:09.572 --> 08:14.363
<i>Their wives run around like banshees
Their children sing the blues</i>

08:14.536 --> 08:18.530
<i>They've got expensive doctors to cure
Their hearts of stone</i>

08:18.707 --> 08:23.827
<i>But nobody, no, nobody
Can make it out here alone</i>

08:32.136 --> 08:34.880
<i>Now, if you listen closely
I'll tell you what I know</i>

08:36.433 --> 08:40.097
<i>Storm clouds are gathering
The wind is gonna blow</i>

08:40.352 --> 08:44.222
<i>The race of man is suffering
And I can hear the moan</i>

08:44.482 --> 08:49.944
<i>Because nobody, but nobody
Can make it out here alone</i>

08:54.534 --> 08:57.493
<i>Alone, all alone</i>

08:57.746 --> 09:02.491
<i>Nobody, but nobody
Can make it out here alone</i>

09:09.799 --> 09:12.462
We got the situation under control.

09:12.635 --> 09:16.174
Just get out of here.
Let us do our job.

09:16.347 --> 09:19.886
We got the situation under control.

09:22.729 --> 09:23.890
Look at these.

09:24.064 --> 09:27.853
This one right here, this is bad.
Girl, that is to die for.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.105
Jessie's. We do hair.

09:31.821 --> 09:34.279
He just did my girl all wrong.

09:34.699 --> 09:39.410
She's scared as hell. I caught her
running around here wearing sunglasses.

09:39.662 --> 09:43.121
And you know how she like bragging
about her green eyes.

09:43.291 --> 09:47.205
You know what's up with that.
Top it off, she's still in love with the nigga.

09:47.378 --> 09:49.745
What's love got to do with it?

09:49.923 --> 09:52.666
You just telling everybody's business.

09:53.259 --> 09:56.502
I'd tell your business too
if you had something to tell. Ha, ha.

09:56.888 --> 10:00.632
Hey, Heywood. Hey, Dex.
How you doing, Maxine?

10:00.809 --> 10:02.596
- Come on, girl. You ready?
- Yeah.

10:02.769 --> 10:06.729
- You got your hair with you?
- What you think this is?

10:06.898 --> 10:09.766
- I know you ain't getting smart.
- Shut up, girl.

10:09.943 --> 10:12.026
That's what I thought. Come on.

10:13.571 --> 10:14.903
Sit your butt down.

10:15.073 --> 10:17.065
- So, what's up?
- Nothing up.

10:30.797 --> 10:33.130
Morning, Jessie. Got any change?

10:33.299 --> 10:37.964
Hell, no. And get your dirty,
unemployed ass away from my shop.

10:38.221 --> 10:39.837
Baha? Baby, do me a favour.

10:40.014 --> 10:44.679
Go to the liquor store and get me
two honey buns and... What else?

10:44.853 --> 10:47.641
Some Big Red. Yeah, I know.

10:47.814 --> 10:50.272
- Twenty.
- Yeah, a 20. Uhn-uhn-uhn. Hey.

10:50.441 --> 10:52.182
And bring me my change!

10:53.069 --> 10:56.358
Leave this conditioner on
for five minutes.

10:56.573 --> 10:57.905
Mm-hm.

10:59.534 --> 11:01.526
You like that, darling?

11:03.288 --> 11:06.656
- Jessie, you are so beautiful.
- Thank you, Heywood.

11:06.875 --> 11:08.958
- I love you.
- I love you too.

11:09.210 --> 11:13.580
- And I love myself.
- I know. Get back to your client.

11:13.840 --> 11:17.004
- Ooh. I love it when you're so forceful.
- Mm-hm.

11:26.144 --> 11:27.726
So...

11:27.896 --> 11:29.853
Yeah.

11:30.273 --> 11:34.563
- So he's out, huh?
- I don't know. I'm thinking about it.

11:34.819 --> 11:37.983
- I know y'all got buck-wild last night.
- Ooh. Yeah.

11:38.239 --> 11:41.949
- Where did y'all go?
- Could you put those over here?

11:42.202 --> 11:45.036
- Snooty Fox Motor Inn.
- No, you didn't.

11:45.288 --> 11:48.952
People, please remember
to turn in your receipts.

11:49.167 --> 11:51.500
- We always do.
- I got mine right here.

11:51.669 --> 11:55.504
- Still got them red walls and all that?
- Mm-hm. Mirrors on the ceiling.

11:55.673 --> 12:00.668
Same old, same old. I'm coming up short.
Are they turning in receipts?

12:00.845 --> 12:03.212
They've been filling them out
and turning them in.

12:03.473 --> 12:06.762
When was the last time you were there?

12:06.935 --> 12:08.426
- What, Snooty Fox?
- Yeah.

12:08.686 --> 12:13.147
- It's been so long, I don't remember.
- That's what I know.

12:13.316 --> 12:17.686
Hey, hey. My girl need her hair
and her nails done.

12:17.946 --> 12:20.313
- Does she have an appointment?
- Mm-mm. No.

12:20.490 --> 12:22.152
She don't have no hair, either.

12:22.325 --> 12:23.611
Heywood.

12:24.285 --> 12:27.744
- Maxine. Make an appointment.
- Yeah, what you want?

12:29.040 --> 12:33.284
Why are you always wearing hats?
What are you hiding?

12:33.461 --> 12:36.545
- Give me my hat. I got new growth.
- Put it back on.

12:36.714 --> 12:40.958
You need to let me do something
to that head of yours.

12:41.219 --> 12:45.964
Lord, I'm tired. You got a poem for me?
Lord knows I need one.

12:46.224 --> 12:48.637
I left my notebook in the car.

12:48.851 --> 12:52.595
- Outgoing mail. In here.
- Where are the stamps?

12:53.064 --> 12:57.274
When you going to get a man?
Always asking questions about mine.

12:57.443 --> 13:00.151
- What, you still in mourning?
- Mm.

13:00.405 --> 13:05.446
Sporting black, looking tore up from
the floor up, no time for your hair.

13:05.618 --> 13:09.453
You can always tell when a woman
ain't giving up no coochie.

13:09.622 --> 13:14.913
I like wearing black. Besides, I ain't
got time for no man in my life.

13:15.086 --> 13:18.921
- Know what your problem is?
- So suddenly I got a problem?

13:19.090 --> 13:22.174
- What's my problem?
- You make bad choices in men.

13:22.427 --> 13:24.134
You don't know how to pick them.

13:34.605 --> 13:39.942
Yo, what's up? What's up,
Mr. Postman? Got some spare change?

13:40.194 --> 13:44.814
No, but I got a spare stamp
so you can mail a job application.

13:44.991 --> 13:47.233
Begging-ass motherfucker.

13:52.415 --> 13:54.873
Y'all didn't get nothing but bills.

14:04.635 --> 14:06.627
Why you always so mad?

14:06.804 --> 14:10.639
You must ain't got no man
because you don't never smile.

14:11.726 --> 14:14.139
- Do you?
- What do you want from me?

14:16.522 --> 14:21.688
I think you kind of fly.
We could start with your phone number.

14:26.074 --> 14:27.110
What's your name?

14:29.369 --> 14:31.907
- Lucky.
- Lucky?

14:32.372 --> 14:33.954
Yeah.

14:34.457 --> 14:37.245
Come here, Lucky.
I wanna whisper something to you.

14:45.426 --> 14:47.292
Let's cut the bullshit.

14:47.637 --> 14:52.473
Now, what do you really,
really want from me?

14:53.893 --> 14:58.183
- You wanna smell my poonani? Hmm?
- Yeah.

15:00.900 --> 15:04.314
- Yeah.
- You'd like that? Mm-hm.

15:05.530 --> 15:08.068
Hold on a minute, baby.

15:08.241 --> 15:12.485
- Jessie. Come here for a minute, please.
- Yeah.

15:14.872 --> 15:16.488
What?

15:16.749 --> 15:20.288
This fine, young, dark brother...

15:20.545 --> 15:23.788
...said he wanna smell my poonani.

15:24.048 --> 15:26.290
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

15:26.467 --> 15:28.584
- Poonani?
- Mm-hm.

15:29.887 --> 15:32.846
- Should I let him?
- Yeah.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.349
So, what do you think?

15:45.236 --> 15:49.651
You need to get your ass some
breath mints. Crazy black bitches.

15:49.907 --> 15:52.115
Get your ass out of here.

15:52.368 --> 15:55.702
I don't know
why I fuck with these ho's.

15:55.872 --> 15:57.704
Here, man.

15:58.833 --> 16:01.871
Don't smoke it. Take a stamp too.

16:02.044 --> 16:05.253
God bless you, brother.
Bless you, man!

16:05.423 --> 16:08.291
I'm not fucking with 101st no more.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.801
I told that lady about them dogs.
She ignored me.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.804
She wants her mail,
she gotta come get it herself.

16:13.973 --> 16:18.138
Did you not once consider
using your Mace?

16:18.436 --> 16:23.101
Mace? That's like Binaca to rottweilers.
Y'all don't pay me enough!

16:23.274 --> 16:27.063
- You're saying you don't want your job?
- Here you go.

16:29.030 --> 16:32.444
Ha-ha. Fucked his nose up.

16:32.617 --> 16:36.361
Right in the middle, man.
Just like Robin Hood, eh?

16:36.537 --> 16:40.156
Y'all wanna get your asses to work
before you get fired?

16:40.333 --> 16:42.165
- What's up, sergeant?
- What's happening?

16:42.335 --> 16:45.123
- I can't call it.
- I'm calling it.

16:45.296 --> 16:47.413
- They tripping on me again.
- What?

16:47.590 --> 16:50.173
Put two more buddhaheads
on the mail carrier before me.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.211
- Again?
- Got me sorting mail with Mexicans.

16:53.387 --> 16:57.472
Chicago, why you talking
about Mexicans? I'll kick your ass.

16:57.642 --> 17:01.306
Tell you what, you better quit
smoking that shit at lunch.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.387
At least we got our own country.

17:03.564 --> 17:05.305
Then why the fuck y'all
keep sneaking out?

17:07.234 --> 17:08.896
That shit is funny, right?

17:13.907 --> 17:15.944
Basketball-playing motherfuckers.

17:17.828 --> 17:20.992
- I'm going to Oaktown. You wanna go?
- Yeah.

17:21.165 --> 17:24.624
- You gonna bring a yamp?
- Here you go. You gonna bring a yamp?

17:24.877 --> 17:29.087
- I got mine, man.
- Yamps. What the fuck is a "yamp"?

17:29.257 --> 17:32.000
A young tramp. Now, do you mind, <i>esé?</i>

17:32.176 --> 17:36.136
Don't worry about
what the players is talking about.

17:36.305 --> 17:42.222
Go have your yamps, corn bread,
ham hocks and whatever else you eat.

17:42.395 --> 17:45.433
- Get out of here.
- Get the ZIP codes right, <i>esé.</i>

17:45.690 --> 17:48.148
- Fix that shit.
- If we gonna do this...

17:48.401 --> 17:51.519
...have that crazy ho you fuck with
hook me up with one of her partners.

17:51.779 --> 17:55.648
- I'm gonna hook you up.
- You always say that.

17:55.825 --> 17:58.408
- Hook me up.
- You gonna call your cousin?

17:58.619 --> 18:03.705
Not yet. We're supposed to find a way
up there anyway for our music thing.

18:03.916 --> 18:08.377
Now it's like I'm getting paid
to go. I'm straight with that.

18:08.629 --> 18:10.837
- See you later.
- Where you going?

18:11.090 --> 18:12.922
Minding my business.

18:28.733 --> 18:31.601
♪ <i>Sits in the tape deck

18:31.777 --> 18:34.565

18:40.286 --> 18:42.903
- What's up, nigga?
- Lounging, man.

18:43.164 --> 18:45.907
- What y'all niggas doing?
- To be honest?

18:46.167 --> 18:48.784
Looking for some busters to jack.

18:50.296 --> 18:54.791
I wanted to tell you something.
Remember Little D? Little Derek?

18:54.967 --> 18:59.257
- D-Dog from up there?
- Yesterday, he got his ass capped out.

18:59.513 --> 19:04.429
- Popped his ass out, straight twisted.
- Gone?

19:04.644 --> 19:07.557
But we gonna get the fools
that got him.

19:07.813 --> 19:11.557
- Ain't no thing but a chicken wing.
- Yeah.

19:11.734 --> 19:14.067
- See you.
- All right. Peace.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.937
- Yeah, peace.
- There won't be no peace today.

19:18.324 --> 19:20.065
Get you a motherfucking
tune-up, nigga.

19:27.041 --> 19:31.957
There he is.
Mr. Postman working motherfucker here.

19:32.213 --> 19:35.047
- Don't start. What's up, Bone?
- What's up?

19:35.299 --> 19:39.088
- Shit. I can't call it.
- How you feeling?

19:39.345 --> 19:43.214
- Tired than a motherfucker.
- Tired?

19:43.391 --> 19:46.759
This ain't none of that chronic,
but you can get some of this Thai bud.

19:46.936 --> 19:49.349
They checking my piss at work.
I can't fuck with it.

19:49.522 --> 19:53.482
Oh, no. That's a terrible thing.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.234
How you doing, Ms. Jackson?

20:08.499 --> 20:13.244
- She can't stand me with a passion.
- She hates your ass.

20:14.088 --> 20:17.252
So, what's up?
You here to check up on Keisha?

20:17.633 --> 20:21.001
I'm gonna give Angel money
to buy her clothes.

20:21.178 --> 20:26.173
Now, you know motherfucking well
you ain't gotta give her money.

20:26.350 --> 20:30.845
I'll take her to the swap meet, Fox
Hills Mall, get her whatever she needs.

20:31.021 --> 20:34.105
No. You ain't got to do that.

20:34.817 --> 20:38.481
- What you mean?
- It's my daughter. I can handle it.

20:38.738 --> 20:42.982
What did I tell you about
this change? Do I look like Las Vegas?

20:43.242 --> 20:46.531
- Do I look like a slot machine?
- It's all I got.

20:46.787 --> 20:52.533
Get your punk ass up out of here
and don't do that shit no more. Shit.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.873
- You cold on these fools.
- I can't help it.

20:56.130 --> 20:59.999
Check this out. It ain't like
I ain't got the money.

21:00.259 --> 21:03.969
Besides, she call me Daddy
sometimes, anyway.

21:04.221 --> 21:08.841
- What you mean, she call you Daddy?
- Just what I said.

21:09.101 --> 21:12.515
- We gonna see who she call Daddy.
- We'll see.

21:12.730 --> 21:15.313
- We gonna find out.
- What we gonna find out, then?

21:15.524 --> 21:17.516
Well, let's see, then.

21:17.777 --> 21:20.520
Well, hurry your slow ass up, then.

21:23.532 --> 21:27.071
- Keisha.
- Hi, Daddy.

21:29.163 --> 21:31.371
- Who's your daddy?
- You.

21:31.540 --> 21:36.410
That's right. That's your son and
this is my daughter. Don't forget it.

21:36.587 --> 21:38.874
Pothead.

21:39.673 --> 21:45.135
It's like I'm her daddy since they
came from the same tired-ass hooker.

21:45.387 --> 21:47.003
How's that?

21:47.181 --> 21:49.969
- Difference.
- What's up, boy?

21:50.726 --> 21:52.467
Uh-oh.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.474
Felix.

21:55.648 --> 21:58.686
What y'all two fools talking about?

21:58.859 --> 22:03.604
- Talking about your yamp ass.
- Here we go. Simple Nick in the house.

22:03.864 --> 22:06.197
Get your ass away from the TV.

22:06.367 --> 22:10.782
What you cleaning up for?
This place looks fucked up as normal.

22:10.955 --> 22:14.244
- Hm, hm, hm.
- "Hm, hm."

22:14.416 --> 22:18.626
What you all nervous for?
You been basing?

22:19.088 --> 22:24.834
I ain't doing shit. I don't remember
saying "I do" to neither one of you.

22:25.052 --> 22:27.544
- Has she?
- No, this is what you do:

22:27.763 --> 22:32.349
Get her and get out of my house. Don't
forget to get her some tennis shoes...

22:32.518 --> 22:36.558
If welfare wasn't paying the rent,
this wouldn't be your house.

22:36.730 --> 22:39.347
- Fuck you.
- Get your ass back in the room. Tramp.

22:39.775 --> 22:41.061
Nigga must have been...

22:41.277 --> 22:44.645
You know what I told your ass
about that shit!

22:45.531 --> 22:49.150
Told her if I catch her doing
that shit again, I'm taking Keisha.

22:49.368 --> 22:55.035
- She ain't got to be around this shit.
- Nothing wrong with her. She's just crazy.

22:55.249 --> 22:58.538
If something was wrong with her ass,
I'd know.

23:00.796 --> 23:04.085
Brother Bone! Brother Bone!

23:04.258 --> 23:09.799
Every time I sit down and wanna watch
a cartoon, somebody gotta call me.

23:09.972 --> 23:15.684
- Here we go. Scarface.
- Get your stamp-licking ass up.

23:16.395 --> 23:19.229
- What's up, man?
- Help me out, man.

23:19.398 --> 23:20.639
What you got?

23:21.609 --> 23:24.773
Go over there and sit with Tony, okay?

23:26.405 --> 23:30.991
- What's up with all this change?
- That's all I got.

23:31.201 --> 23:33.909
<i>How do you like the Felix outfit?</i>

23:34.163 --> 23:37.406
<i>Never mind that. Just get the diamonds.</i>

23:37.666 --> 23:41.501
<i>Wow, professor. Look at that!</i>

23:42.004 --> 23:46.715
<i>Loose diamonds.
Let's go down and pick them up.</i>

23:46.884 --> 23:50.468
<i>Who's that little character?</i>

23:53.682 --> 23:57.722
- Ah! Oh, my God!
- Hey, nigga. Get the fuck out of here.

23:57.895 --> 24:02.310
- That is Lucky. That is Lucky!
- Lucky who? Get the fuck out.

24:03.567 --> 24:06.856
Come on, Keisha.
We're going to see your grandma.

24:07.029 --> 24:10.773
Don't be coming in my house
starting all that bullshit!

24:10.950 --> 24:15.320
How you gonna be fucking some nigga
when my daughter's here?

24:18.332 --> 24:20.039
Goddamn, here they go.

24:20.250 --> 24:25.291
- Who is this motherfucker?
- Mind your own motherfucking business.

24:47.903 --> 24:52.147
- I don't need this shit!
- Stupid-ass motherfucker.

24:52.741 --> 24:54.198
Motherfucker...

24:55.285 --> 24:58.995
- I wanna go too.
- Where are you taking Keisha?

24:59.164 --> 25:02.498
How you gonna be fucking some nigga
while my daughter here?

25:02.710 --> 25:05.669
Where you going with my
goddamn child?

25:05.838 --> 25:08.672
<i>In a time of secret wooing</i>

25:08.841 --> 25:12.585
<i>Today prepares tomorrow's ruin</i>

25:12.761 --> 25:16.175
<i>Left knows not what right is doing</i>

25:16.348 --> 25:19.466
<i>My heart is torn asunder</i>

25:19.643 --> 25:21.930
<i>In a time of furtive sighs</i>

25:22.187 --> 25:25.726
<i>Sweet hellos and sad goodbyes</i>

25:25.899 --> 25:29.483
<i>Half-truths told and entire lies</i>

25:29.653 --> 25:34.444
<i>My conscience echoes thunder</i>

25:34.616 --> 25:37.529
<i>In a time when kingdoms come</i>

25:37.703 --> 25:40.787
<i>Joy is brief as summer's fun</i>

25:40.956 --> 25:45.417
<i>Happiness
Its race has run</i>

25:45.627 --> 25:50.042
<i>Then pain stalks in to plunder</i>

25:52.634 --> 25:57.846
- So, what you think?
- It's pretty. What you call it?

25:58.015 --> 25:59.301
"In a Time."

26:02.478 --> 26:07.394
Mm-mm. Chicago paging me.
Let me see what he wants.

26:13.072 --> 26:15.610
I can't use your phone?

26:15.783 --> 26:18.366
You know better.

26:18.869 --> 26:22.112
- You got some change?
- I'm straight.

26:27.753 --> 26:29.619
What'd they say?

26:44.853 --> 26:48.096
- Heywood.
- So, what's up?

26:49.525 --> 26:50.936
Mm-hm.

26:52.027 --> 26:53.689
Mm-hm.

26:54.947 --> 26:57.405
Yeah. I'm with it.

26:57.574 --> 27:00.908
We got a hair show
to go to up there, anyway.

27:02.704 --> 27:08.746
Tsk. What you mean, "a fine one"?
You trying to say I got ugly friends?

27:10.629 --> 27:12.791
I ain't got no ugly friends.

27:14.466 --> 27:16.799
You wanna talk about it?

27:17.344 --> 27:18.755
Hmm?

27:20.389 --> 27:22.756
I think you'll feel better
if you talk about it.

27:25.519 --> 27:28.307
What the hell are they
doing out there now?

27:29.648 --> 27:33.767
- I'll be glad when we get out of here.
- What's wrong?

27:38.574 --> 27:40.440
What's wrong?

27:55.215 --> 27:58.583
You got your styles together
for the Oakland show?

27:59.761 --> 28:04.552
Yeah, I'm just gonna work
on Dina and Gina's head a bit.

28:04.725 --> 28:08.810
If they like it, they like it.
If they don't, they don't.

28:08.979 --> 28:14.850
Will you ride with us? We got us a
little caravan going. We gonna party.

28:15.694 --> 28:19.688
Oh, Justice. Look at your face.

28:20.199 --> 28:24.409
Listen, I know I'm not your mama,
and I'm not trying to be...

28:24.620 --> 28:27.829
...but I gotta tell you,
you got to move on.

28:27.998 --> 28:32.538
A man is a tool. You got to know
when to take him out the box...

28:32.753 --> 28:37.873
...and when to put him back in. If you
lose one, go get yourself another one.

28:38.550 --> 28:42.760
Take a chance, baby.
Do something different for a change.

28:43.013 --> 28:46.051
There's another man
out there somewhere.

28:47.392 --> 28:50.851
And out here, sometimes
you're gonna lose one.

28:51.063 --> 28:54.147
Like a blow dryer or a good hairbrush.

28:59.154 --> 29:03.569
What I got to do?
Play everybody's mama in this shop?

29:03.742 --> 29:06.735
Hell, I got my own problems.

29:11.959 --> 29:14.246
Okay, where's my brush?

29:15.545 --> 29:18.788
I'm tired of my shit
disappearing around here.

29:25.222 --> 29:28.590
Why you always borrowing
my shit without asking?

29:28.809 --> 29:33.975
I asked you this morning if I could
borrow your brush, and you said yes...

29:34.147 --> 29:38.642
...and I have returned it to you.
Why you gonna cry about it, Dexter?

29:39.486 --> 29:43.526
- You sound like my little niece.
- Here we go again.

29:43.699 --> 29:46.112
What's your new man talking about?

29:46.285 --> 29:52.031
Girl, he want me to go on a run
with him. This is good.

29:52.207 --> 29:55.621
I don't wanna have to be messing
with it all the time.

29:55.836 --> 29:57.793
- Just get up and go.
- You know, girl...

29:59.464 --> 30:02.628
You're catching me
on the wrong goddamn day.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.167
So you got balls?

30:04.428 --> 30:09.173
I was All-City strong safety
at Dorsey High. I'll get in your ass.

30:09.391 --> 30:12.304
And not the way
you want me to, Sexy Dex.

30:12.477 --> 30:15.094
Please. Stop this right now.

30:15.355 --> 30:18.314
- What's a "run"?
- You know what a run is.

30:18.483 --> 30:22.227
I don't know what a run is.
Stop messing with your head.

30:22.404 --> 30:24.566
Now, what's a run?

30:25.073 --> 30:31.695
A run? Well, it's like...
You really wanna know, girl?

30:31.913 --> 30:34.781
- If you don't stop playing with me...
- Okay, girl.

30:34.958 --> 30:38.372
Chicago, my boyfriend,
works at the post office.

30:38.545 --> 30:41.413
<i>The one on Century and Van Ness.</i>

30:41.631 --> 30:46.797
<i>Every so often, he and his friend gotta
drive this mail truck up to Oakland.</i>

30:47.262 --> 30:50.676
- J, you listening to me?
- Yeah, I'm listening.

30:50.849 --> 30:54.559
Like I said, they drive
this mail truck to Oakland.

30:54.728 --> 31:00.224
And sometimes I go with them.
And I was thinking...

31:00.650 --> 31:03.017
- You're not having it?
- Uhn-uhn.

31:04.946 --> 31:08.610
I got your bitch. Okay?
I got your bitch.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.484
- Calm down.
- What you wanna do?

31:11.661 --> 31:12.868
Not here.

31:13.080 --> 31:17.415
What you doing seeing a mailman?
They don't make no money.

31:17.584 --> 31:20.418
What he gonna do for you,
mail your bills for free?

31:20.587 --> 31:24.376
Ugh. Why you don't ever wanna have
no fun no more?

31:24.591 --> 31:28.926
You know the world's just a big place
for us to go out and fuck up in it.

and I can't have a cigarette?

35:09.149 --> 35:12.267
Shut the fuck up
and put the cigarette out!

35:14.446 --> 35:19.066
- You going up north to see Kalil?
- Yeah.

35:19.951 --> 35:22.944
I'm finally gonna work on
this music thing.

35:23.580 --> 35:28.041

- Bad as ever.

35:51.775 --> 35:53.858
Mm-hm.

35:56.446 --> 36:01.282
I want her to stay with us for good.

52:52.419 --> 52:56.538

Come on.

53:38.841 --> 53:40.673

53:40.843 --> 53:44.837

54:03.657 --> 54:07.776

- Looks like barbecue.

54:31.935 --> 54:35.178
- Is that free barbecue?
- Shit. It gonna be free.

54:35.355 --> 54:39.895

54:40.068 --> 54:42.606

54:42.780 --> 54:45.272

54:45.449 --> 54:48.487

54:48.660 --> 54:50.526
Especially when it comes to barbecue.

54:52.748 --> 54:56.537
Lordy, Lordy!
Will you look at them ladies? Goddamn.

54:56.710 --> 54:59.953
Whoo! Mm-hmm.

55:00.130 --> 55:04.921

- I hope we're distant relatives.

55:05.177 --> 55:06.839
- Oh, really? Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.

55:07.012 --> 55:10.801
Well, you know,
third and removed don't count.

55:10.974 --> 55:13.717
- I don't think so.
- My cousin, my cousin!

55:13.894 --> 55:17.888
Look at my family over here.
My cousins. What's up, cousin?

55:18.148 --> 55:20.390
- How you doing, boy?
- Cousin!

55:20.567 --> 55:22.524

55:22.694 --> 55:26.563
I ain't seen you in I don't know when.

55:26.740 --> 55:31.826

- Oh. Lucky, yeah.

55:39.628 --> 55:44.293
Yeah. With a lady like this, shit,
I'd call you Lucky too.

55:44.508 --> 55:48.798
- What's your name, sweet thing?
- Justice.

55:48.971 --> 55:51.554

55:51.723 --> 55:55.467

56:09.366 --> 56:11.153
Cousin Pete.
That's right, Cousin Pete.

56:11.326 --> 56:14.319
Come here.
I want y'all to meet some family.

56:14.538 --> 56:16.621

56:16.832 --> 56:22.078

Cousin Kwame. What's up, bro?

56:26.258 --> 56:30.548

Sitting over here, we got Aunt April,

56:35.642 --> 56:38.100
I call them the Calendar Sisters.

56:38.270 --> 56:40.512

- Ain't they pretty?

56:40.772 --> 56:45.016

56:51.909 --> 56:54.743
- It's cool?
- You better go get something to eat.

56:54.912 --> 56:58.701
Go ahead with him.
I'm gonna play some cards.

56:58.874 --> 57:05.542
Bye. Look at them.
Don't they make such a cute couple?

57:14.973 --> 57:19.593
- Are you all in love?
- Yeah.

57:20.771 --> 57:24.435
Baby, what would you know about love?

57:25.275 --> 57:26.436
Nothing.

57:26.610 --> 57:29.819
How can you be in love
if you don't know nothing about it?

57:29.988 --> 57:32.856
- Just the way things go.
- Are you married?

57:33.033 --> 57:35.366
- Yeah.
- How long you been married?

57:36.411 --> 57:39.154
About six months now.

57:40.582 --> 57:43.746
Oh. I don't wear it all the time.

57:44.461 --> 57:47.670
You don't mind
if she doesn't wear your ring?

57:47.839 --> 57:49.125
No, he don't mind.

57:49.299 --> 57:52.417
He can answer for himself,
if he's a real man.

57:52.594 --> 57:54.301
Well?

57:55.305 --> 57:57.467
No, no. I don't mind.

57:57.641 --> 58:01.009
Shoot, my husband would kill me
if I didn't wear no ring.

58:01.186 --> 58:03.553
- I heard that.
- And I know that's right.

58:07.484 --> 58:11.444
- Damn, you greedy.
- Gotta eat to live.

58:11.655 --> 58:14.693
Well, why you so skinny, then?

58:14.866 --> 58:19.736
Look at the cute baby.
Can I hold her for you?

58:21.623 --> 58:25.867
Look at you. I heard that.
Give me a burp. That spittle?

58:26.044 --> 58:29.128
You be dating them professional men?

58:29.297 --> 58:32.665
Doctors, lawyers, pharmacists?

58:33.468 --> 58:37.553
Street pharmacists?
I knew you was like that.

58:37.723 --> 58:39.806
Here. I'll take her now.

58:39.975 --> 58:43.389
She is so cute. You sure?
What's her name?

58:43.562 --> 58:45.679
Her name is Imani.

58:45.856 --> 58:52.194
Hi, Imani. Hi there.
You're so cute. Yes, you are.

58:53.780 --> 58:57.490
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Imani.

59:01.663 --> 59:03.950
So you got a kid?

59:05.250 --> 59:10.370
- Why you ask me that?
- Because you look like the type.

59:11.339 --> 59:15.379
- And what's the type?
- I don't know.

59:15.886 --> 59:19.175
This. You just walking by.
You the type.

59:19.347 --> 59:21.805
Anyway...

59:23.226 --> 59:24.762
Do you got any kids?

59:24.936 --> 59:28.680
Hell, no, I ain't got no kids.
I don't even like kids.

59:28.857 --> 59:31.565
Sure don't look like that to me.

59:35.614 --> 59:37.901
This here's kind of cool.

59:39.367 --> 59:41.700
You ever been to one of these?

59:41.870 --> 59:47.411
No, I ain't got much family.
Family I do have, we ain't this close.

59:47.584 --> 59:51.828
I ain't never seen so many black folks
in one spot and there ain't no fight.

59:58.762 --> 01:00:02.756
Let's get back to these
street pharmacists you used to see.

01:00:02.933 --> 01:00:06.301
Let me tell you something.
I only went out with one.

01:00:06.478 --> 01:00:10.267
He was my first boyfriend,
my first love. He meant a lot to me.

01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:16.728
- So you was in it for the money?
- Now you're getting too damn personal.

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:19.063
Okay.

01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:27.410
What the fuck you know? You don't
even keep your fucking nails clean.

01:00:34.005 --> 01:00:37.089
I want to talk to you about morals.

01:00:37.342 --> 01:00:42.633
The morals of the young people today
is gonna get them in big trouble.

01:00:42.889 --> 01:00:46.724
Because they act like
they don't know the difference...

01:00:46.893 --> 01:00:49.260
...between right and wrong.

01:00:49.437 --> 01:00:53.977
This is the truth. And one
of the reasons is their parents.

01:00:54.151 --> 01:00:56.859
Parents are not taking care
of the children.

01:00:57.028 --> 01:01:01.068
They don't tell them the difference
between right and wrong.

01:01:01.241 --> 01:01:04.530
Wait, now. No, ma'am.
You have to listen.

01:01:04.703 --> 01:01:07.821
Because part of the responsibility
is the children.

01:01:08.623 --> 01:01:10.740
Because this is their life.

01:01:10.917 --> 01:01:15.378
It's not their mama's or papa's.
They have to think for themselves.

01:01:15.547 --> 01:01:19.666
Even if their mama and papa
didn't do something about it...

01:01:19.843 --> 01:01:24.679
...the children have to think
and try their best to come on up.

01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:27.974
- Take this girl here.
- What about her?

01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:32.270
That child ain't a bit more married
than the man in the moon.

01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:35.890
- How you doing?
- Fine, how you doing?

01:01:36.776 --> 01:01:40.770
She's flirting with another man.
Talking about she's married.

01:01:40.947 --> 01:01:43.314
- She's young.
- She's loose.

01:01:43.491 --> 01:01:46.029
She's not loose. You were young once.

01:01:46.203 --> 01:01:49.537
Yeah, but I was never flitty.
I was never flitty.

01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:52.369
She was never flitty.

01:01:56.963 --> 01:02:00.582
Excuse me, I need to talk
to my friend. What's wrong with you?

01:02:00.759 --> 01:02:02.591
Chicago gonna kick your ass.

01:02:02.802 --> 01:02:06.967
- You gonna play cards or sightsee?
- Chicago, come on.

01:02:07.182 --> 01:02:11.847
- Chicago ain't gonna do shit.
- You stupid? He'll kick your ass.

01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:17.391
- You're killing my action, girl. Stop.
- Iesha, what action?

01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:19.308
- What's up?
- She tripping.

01:02:19.486 --> 01:02:21.478
Chicago, she ain't do nothing wrong.

01:02:21.655 --> 01:02:23.567
You got nothing to do with this.

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:26.858
- Calm down.
- She know what she's doing.

01:02:27.035 --> 01:02:30.153
- Come on, girl.
- Wait, don't start nothing.

01:02:30.372 --> 01:02:34.992
- I'm talking. I'm talking.
- Come on, don't start fighting.

01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:39.250
- What's wrong with you, man?
- I can't talk to nobody?

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:42.506
What's happening, man?

01:02:44.094 --> 01:02:48.464
- You mind if I take some food to go?
- No, man. You go ahead.

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:50.632
- My cousin! Okay.
- Don't you worry.

01:02:50.809 --> 01:02:55.349
Something don't look right over here.
I'm gonna have to get in this shit.

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:57.642
- Chicago, stop.
- Try to be cool.

01:02:57.899 --> 01:03:01.063
- Gonna get his ass.
- We were just talking.

01:03:01.278 --> 01:03:03.770
Get your hands off me. Shit.

01:03:03.947 --> 01:03:05.984
- Fuck you.
- Get out of my face.

01:03:06.157 --> 01:03:08.991
Why you gotta act up
every time we go someplace?

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:12.278
- Shut up.
- Why you gotta act up?

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:16.199
What's your problem?
Why the fuck you gotta disrespect me?

01:03:16.376 --> 01:03:18.242
Fuck you. You don't own me.

01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:21.834
Fuck you, bitch.
You and your drunk-ass pussy.

01:03:22.048 --> 01:03:25.712
If I'm a bitch,
then why the fuck you with me?

01:03:25.885 --> 01:03:29.754
- I don't know why.
- Then leave. Step the fuck off.

01:03:29.931 --> 01:03:33.845
I don't keep no niggas
when they don't wanna be kept.

01:03:34.102 --> 01:03:36.810
First of all, you don't keep shit, all right.

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:39.393
All that talking.
Do that shit while you walking.

01:03:39.649 --> 01:03:44.235
Pull over somewhere. I need
to talk to her. I'm sick of this shit.

01:03:44.404 --> 01:03:47.272
I'm a black bastard now, right?
I wasn't when I bought you that shit.

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:51.655
You was a black bastard then,
and you a black fucking bastard now.

01:03:51.828 --> 01:03:54.946
- Why the fuck we stopping?
- Good, I gotta pee.

01:03:55.123 --> 01:03:58.992
You know why you got to pee?
Because you drink too much.

01:03:59.169 --> 01:04:03.504
Get your hands off me.
I'll pee on your motherfucking ass.

01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:06.416
Let me out this shit. I gotta pee.

01:04:06.634 --> 01:04:10.628
Open the door.
You're gonna have some wet-ass mail.

01:04:10.805 --> 01:04:13.013
Come here, Iesha. I wanna talk to you.

01:04:13.183 --> 01:04:15.391
What's wrong, J?

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:18.223
Lucky fucking with you?
I'm gonna fuck you up.

01:04:18.396 --> 01:04:22.811
- Girl, come here. I wanna talk to you.
- Let me put on my jacket.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:33.534
Shit. Look at you.

01:04:34.037 --> 01:04:36.245
What's up, J?

01:04:37.415 --> 01:04:38.781
What's the problem, girl?

01:04:38.958 --> 01:04:43.999
This is the problem. I'm sick of this.
You act like an alcoholic bitch.

01:04:44.172 --> 01:04:47.791
- Why you calling me a bitch?
- All you do is get drunk.

01:04:47.967 --> 01:04:51.711
That's why I never go anyplace with you.
You always acting crazy.

01:04:52.263 --> 01:04:54.971
Just like my damn mama.

01:04:56.434 --> 01:04:58.721
I'm sorry.

01:04:59.437 --> 01:05:03.021
God, I'm sorry, J.

01:05:03.316 --> 01:05:09.608
It's okay. It's gonna be all right.
You just gotta freeze up on that shit.

01:05:09.781 --> 01:05:14.446
I didn't know. I swear I didn't know.

01:05:14.702 --> 01:05:18.992
You're my best friend, though.
I don't wanna hurt you.

01:05:19.624 --> 01:05:24.369
And I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:26.958
You just gotta stop.

01:05:27.215 --> 01:05:31.300
I know. God, I know.

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:37.506
Look at me.

01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:41.302
I gotta pee.

01:05:42.856 --> 01:05:45.269
- You old cow, come on.
- You a cow!

01:05:45.442 --> 01:05:48.401
You're right.
Shit don't change. I told you.

01:05:48.570 --> 01:05:52.029
Can't give these ho's shit.
They try to break your back.

01:05:52.198 --> 01:05:56.067
R-E-S-P-E-C-T

01:05:59.372 --> 01:06:02.831
- Still mad at me?
- Come on, it's hot. What's up?

01:06:03.001 --> 01:06:04.833
I'm sorry, Chicago.

01:06:07.046 --> 01:06:10.505
- Hey, that's nice. Who's that?
- My cousin Kalil.

01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:19.341

to Oakland and work on this music.

It's all right, man.
It ain't all that.

01:06:22.687 --> 01:06:28.479

to say? At least the nigga's creative.

Fuck, he ain't creative. I'm creative.

01:06:31.946 --> 01:06:34.404

- I can dress.

01:06:34.574 --> 01:06:38.784

a man because he trying and you ain't.

He used to give me
and my cousins change.

01:21:19.166 --> 01:21:22.876
He'd go to the liquor store
and buy a 40-ounce of beer.

01:21:23.045 --> 01:21:25.788
Always throw us the change.

01:21:30.010 --> 01:21:33.003
I'd always ask for the big nickel.

01:21:34.598 --> 01:21:38.387
I couldn't pronounce "quarter,"
so that's what I called it. Heh.

01:21:50.322 --> 01:21:53.565
Look at your nails. Give me your hand.

01:21:53.742 --> 01:21:56.325
Come on, give me your hand.

01:22:00.874 --> 01:22:05.494
Anyway, so because of that,
my grandmama used to say...

01:22:05.671 --> 01:22:08.664
...I was always looking for the big nickel.

01:22:17.349 --> 01:22:21.468
- That's before she died.
- When did she die?

01:22:22.938 --> 01:22:25.146
About two years ago.

01:22:26.942 --> 01:22:29.480
She left me the house.

01:22:38.704 --> 01:22:44.575
When I was 12,
my mama committed suicide.

01:22:53.594 --> 01:22:57.429
She named me Justice
because she was in law school...

01:22:57.598 --> 01:23:00.090
...when she was pregnant with me.

01:23:07.774 --> 01:23:10.391
I'm all alone now, though.

01:23:13.530 --> 01:23:17.900
I got a cat. Cute little cat.

01:23:19.286 --> 01:23:21.073
Damn.

01:24:45.622 --> 01:24:48.114
<i>Give me your hand</i>

01:24:48.292 --> 01:24:53.287
<i>Make room for me to lead and follow you
Beyond this rage of poetry</i>

01:24:53.463 --> 01:24:56.422
<i>Let others have privacy
Of touching words</i>

01:24:56.592 --> 01:24:58.879
<i>And love of loss of love</i>

01:24:59.052 --> 01:25:03.262
<i>For me, give me your hand</i>

01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:16.358
Look, I gotta tell you something.

01:25:22.492 --> 01:25:25.485
Shit, Lucky, don't tell me
you got something.

01:25:25.662 --> 01:25:30.623
No. I'm only telling you this
because I care about you...

01:25:30.792 --> 01:25:34.081
...and I think you should know
before we go any further.

01:25:59.571 --> 01:26:01.938
A little girl, huh?

01:26:04.284 --> 01:26:06.947
Why didn't you tell me
in the beginning?

01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:13.208
I mean, how was I supposed
to know what we was doing?

01:26:15.295 --> 01:26:17.662
I'm gonna go check on my cousin.

01:26:27.182 --> 01:26:30.095
Aunt Audrey. Kalil.

01:26:30.686 --> 01:26:34.350
Aunt Audrey. Kalil!

01:26:55.752 --> 01:26:57.869
Hey, where do you think you're going?

01:26:59.506 --> 01:27:02.499
- Kalil!
- Shit, man, it's his cousin!

01:27:03.885 --> 01:27:09.097
- Yo, man, somebody shot Kalil.
- Who shot him?

01:27:09.307 --> 01:27:11.970
What relationship is
this woman to him?

01:27:15.355 --> 01:27:17.642
Just get away from me, man!

01:27:19.526 --> 01:27:23.566
Cover him up, man! Cover him up!
What the fuck are you doing?

01:27:48.138 --> 01:27:49.174
Hmm...

01:27:51.057 --> 01:27:52.093
Ah!

01:28:03.403 --> 01:28:04.484
Yay!

01:29:06.258 --> 01:29:11.344
- What's up? What room we in?
- Ew. What happened to you?

01:29:21.523 --> 01:29:23.355
Don't touch me.

01:29:24.234 --> 01:29:27.022
If I had got there on time,
this never would have happened.

01:29:29.531 --> 01:29:31.944
Instead of fucking with you.

01:29:34.452 --> 01:29:36.193
What?

01:30:20.332 --> 01:30:24.121
So we scraping the bottom
of the pudding cup now, huh?

01:30:26.588 --> 01:30:29.706
Know what you talking about
before you judge, okay?

01:30:29.883 --> 01:30:32.626
Well, excuse me. I'm sorry.

01:30:35.347 --> 01:30:38.055
You even walk different.

01:30:41.102 --> 01:30:47.064
Let's go, fellas, all right?
I don't got all day. Watch your head.

01:30:47.233 --> 01:30:49.350
I thought there was gonna
be two of you.

01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:53.692
No, it's just me.

01:30:55.075 --> 01:30:59.160
- See you the next time around.
- No, I don't think so.

01:30:59.663 --> 01:31:04.249
You don't fight no man with your fist.
You fight him in his wallet.

01:31:04.417 --> 01:31:09.378
Instead of swinging at him,
you should have gave him some.

01:31:09.547 --> 01:31:13.461
Wait till he went to sleep
and took that credit card.

01:31:13.635 --> 01:31:16.969
- And we all would have had a party.
- On him!

01:31:17.138 --> 01:31:21.178
What credit card?
That nigga ain't got no credit card.

01:31:21.351 --> 01:31:24.469
- No credit cards?
- Shit, then you is a fool.

Morning, Lawrence. You hungry, baby?
Come here and get something to eat.

01:34:07.809 --> 01:34:09.721
I ain't hungry.

01:34:10.770 --> 01:34:12.978
Too mad to eat.

01:34:14.941 --> 01:34:20.061
Audrey. Audrey, sit down. Sit down.
You gonna wear yourself out.

01:34:35.879 --> 01:34:37.620
Lawrence.

01:34:42.260 --> 01:34:45.128
Shante, check that chicken, baby.

01:34:46.014 --> 01:34:48.131
Make sure it don't burn.

01:34:52.478 --> 01:34:54.265
Lawrence.

01:34:55.815 --> 01:34:59.183
I want you to know,
you my favourite nephew.

01:35:00.361 --> 01:35:05.948
Your mama and I, even though we're
sisters, we don't always get along.

01:35:08.077 --> 01:35:12.697
But I was always happy
that you and Kalil were like brothers.

01:35:13.458 --> 01:35:17.293
Family's got to stick together,
no matter what.

01:35:21.007 --> 01:35:26.093
Aunt Audrey, I know you're probably
not thinking about this right now.

01:35:26.679 --> 01:35:29.171
Probably ain't important to y'all.

01:35:32.810 --> 01:35:35.223
But it's important to me...

01:35:36.856 --> 01:35:40.349
...to know what you're gonna do
with the equipment.

01:35:40.526 --> 01:35:43.143
- We gonna sell it. We need the money.
- What?

01:35:43.321 --> 01:35:46.029
Why don't you mind your business?

01:35:46.199 --> 01:35:50.785
He put every dollar he had into that
equipment. You just gonna fuck it up?

01:35:50.995 --> 01:35:54.363
- Watch your mouth.
- I'm serious. You know he did.

01:35:54.540 --> 01:35:56.532
What you think we should do?

01:35:59.337 --> 01:36:01.203
Give it to me.

01:36:02.757 --> 01:36:04.089
I'll do something with it.

01:36:04.509 --> 01:36:07.547
<i>I'll do what he would
have wanted me to do:</i>

01:36:07.762 --> 01:36:09.970
<i>Use it.</i>

01:36:10.556 --> 01:36:14.641
Tell Annie I said hi. I love you.

01:36:14.811 --> 01:36:16.518
I love you too.

01:37:27.425 --> 01:37:30.168
<i>Pretty women wonder
Where my secret lies</i>

01:37:30.345 --> 01:37:34.009
<i>I'm not cute
Or built to suit a fashion model's size</i>

01:37:34.182 --> 01:37:38.517
<i>But when I start to tell them
They think I'm telling lies</i>

01:37:38.686 --> 01:37:43.056
<i>I say, it's the reach of my arms
The span of my hips</i>

01:37:43.232 --> 01:37:46.396
<i>The stride of my step
The curl of my lips</i>

01:37:46.611 --> 01:37:52.152
<i>I'm a woman, phenomenally
Phenomenal woman, that's me</i>

01:37:52.325 --> 01:37:55.944
<i>I walk into a room
Just as cool as you please</i>

01:37:56.120 --> 01:38:01.206
<i>And to a man, the fellows stand
Or they fall down to their knees</i>

01:38:01.376 --> 01:38:04.915
<i>Then they swarm around me
Like a hive of honey bees</i>

01:38:05.088 --> 01:38:10.004
<i>I say, it's the fire in my eyes
The flash of my teeth</i>

01:38:10.176 --> 01:38:13.544
<i>The swing in my waist
And the joy in my feet</i>

01:38:13.721 --> 01:38:19.012
<i>I'm a woman, phenomenally
Phenomenal woman, that's me</i>

01:38:21.312 --> 01:38:24.555
- Damn!
- Daddy, could we go to the store?

01:38:26.359 --> 01:38:30.148
Go in the living room.
It's too dangerous in here.

01:38:34.158 --> 01:38:35.524
<i>What they see in me</i>

01:38:35.701 --> 01:38:40.412
<i>They try so much
But they can't touch my inner mystery</i>

01:38:40.581 --> 01:38:44.621
<i>When I try to show them
They still can't see</i>

01:38:44.794 --> 01:38:49.164
<i>I say, it's the arch of my back
The sun of my smile</i>

01:38:49.340 --> 01:38:52.708
<i>The ride of my breasts
And the grace of my style</i>

01:38:52.885 --> 01:38:59.633

Phenomenal woman, that's me</i>

Just why my head's not bowed</i>

01:39:26.461 --> 01:39:30.626
<i>I don't have to shout orjump about
Or have to talk real loud</i>

01:39:30.798 --> 01:39:34.462
<i>When you see me passing
It ought to make you proud</i>

01:39:34.635 --> 01:39:39.255
<i>I say, it's the click of my heels
The bend of my hair</i>

01:39:39.432 --> 01:39:42.800
<i>The palm of my hand
The need for my care</i>

01:39:42.977 --> 01:39:49.144

01:43:00.216 --> 01:43:01.752
Your nails are clean.

01:43:03.886 --> 01:43:08.347
- I wonder why.
- They living a fairy tale.

01:43:08.516 --> 01:43:11.884
- What are y'all looking at?
- I wouldn't have forgiven you.

01:43:12.061 --> 01:43:14.895
- What have you done with her head?
- Nothing.

01:43:15.064 --> 01:43:19.104
That's just what it look like too.
Come on, let me fix your hair.

01:43:19.402 --> 01:43:22.895
- Her hair look fine.
- Come on. It's a mess.

01:43:23.114 --> 01:43:28.200
- I guess my assumption was right.
- Ain't wearing black no more either.

01:43:28.369 --> 01:43:32.204

But he's not my type.

- Kind of cute, though.
- Nice nose.

01:43:37.503 --> 01:43:39.961
There's a few things
we could do with your hair.

01:43:40.131 --> 01:43:46.253
We can put some ponytails in it
and huge flower ribbons. Or barrettes.

01:43:47.179 --> 01:43:52.800
Or we can put
some big, big, big curls in it.

01:43:52.977 --> 01:43:56.812
Big locks.
Which way would you like it?

01:43:56.981 --> 01:44:00.770
- Curls.
- Like the curls? The curls, okay.

01:44:00.943 --> 01:44:04.357
- Do you go to school, Keisha?
- Yeah.

01:44:04.530 --> 01:44:07.864
- You do? You like school?
- Yeah.

01:44:08.033 --> 01:44:10.901
- What's your teacher's name?
- Miss Frazier.

01:44:11.078 --> 01:44:12.159
