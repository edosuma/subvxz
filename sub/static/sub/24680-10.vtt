In New York City's war on crime,

00:09.989 --> 00:13.025
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:13.025 --> 00:14.874
of the Major Case Squad.

00:14.874 --> 00:17.367

00:26.403 --> 00:28.815
What's wrong?

00:28.815 --> 00:31.623
Where are you going?

00:31.623 --> 00:34.066
That window of opportunity?
It's closing.

00:34.066 --> 00:37.099
I have to call in.
Someone's hacking my computer.

00:39.672 --> 00:42.415
- Hey, Carlos.!
- This hibrido won't give me my money.

00:42.415 --> 00:45.472
Don't break it.
Let me see.

00:46.133 --> 00:47.479
Says your account got no money.

00:47.479 --> 00:50.613
I know what it says, ladron.
I've been robbed!

00:50.613 --> 00:52.345
Rick's shutting down
the computers in five minutes.

00:52.345 --> 00:54.400
- Why? What's going on?
- All I know is those guys have badges.

00:54.400 --> 00:58.094
They wanna check the main computer.

01:00.972 --> 01:02.642
I can't believe you'd do that.

01:02.642 --> 01:04.313
Then watch your back, bitch,

01:04.313 --> 01:06.797
or next time I'll have your head on a stick.

01:06.797 --> 01:08.285
Corinne, are you all right?

01:08.285 --> 01:11.382
Mr. Dalton? Yes, I'm fine.

01:11.382 --> 01:12.951
You should have gone home hours ago.

01:12.951 --> 01:14.508
I'm sorry.
I got caught up in something.

01:14.508 --> 01:18.698
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:21.923 --> 01:25.233
Yes. One hundred thousand dollars.

01:25.233 --> 01:27.125
I'm not sure how it got into our account.

01:27.125 --> 01:31.074
Yes. The tickets were sent to me.

01:31.074 --> 01:34.810
But I didn't make the reservations.

01:34.810 --> 01:37.819
That's my brother.
He made them?

01:37.819 --> 01:40.082
- I will call you back.
- We have to talk.

01:40.082 --> 01:43.422
I don't care what they told you.
I didn't do anything to their computers.

01:43.422 --> 01:45.511
I believe you,
but it's not up to me.

01:45.511 --> 01:47.182
I need another job.

01:47.182 --> 01:51.161
Temp work's a little slow right now.
Call me in a week or two.

01:59.960 --> 02:02.342
- Yeah, who is it?
- Right Time Temps.

02:02.342 --> 02:05.616
I got a package here for a Corinne Kennedy.

02:05.616 --> 02:08.567
Come on up.

02:11.800 --> 02:14.538
Just a minute.

02:17.335 --> 02:21.234
Do I have to sign something?

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC:  2004/01/04

03:18.693 --> 03:20.840
The Columbian consul thought
a plane landed on top of him.

03:20.840 --> 03:23.545
911 got the call at 11:25.

03:23.545 --> 03:26.067
No I.D.
We're canvassing that building.

03:26.067 --> 03:28.308
We're thinking she's a jumper.

03:36.841 --> 03:39.903
Looks like, uh, crumbs.

03:42.862 --> 03:46.949
There's not much discoloration.

03:46.949 --> 03:50.155
Must've happened right before she died.

03:51.476 --> 03:56.711
She was pushed off by someone
big enough to lift her off her feet.

03:56.711 --> 03:58.460
My doorman went off duty at 11:00.

03:58.460 --> 04:01.072
He said Miss Kennedy came home alone at 9:30.

04:01.072 --> 04:02.310
She have any friends in the building?

04:02.310 --> 04:04.001
Not that we noticed.

04:04.001 --> 04:07.101
She was shy. Nice, but shy.

04:07.101 --> 04:08.791
Shame for such a pretty girl.

04:08.791 --> 04:12.451
All right, the officer
will take your statement.

04:12.451 --> 04:16.991
This has been partially chewed.

04:16.991 --> 04:22.223
She spewed it out of her mouth
when he grabbed her by the throat.

04:24.260 --> 04:25.969
Soon as she opened the door,

04:25.969 --> 04:29.443
he was on her. He took her out there.

04:30.084 --> 04:33.555
No mistaking,
he came to kill her.

04:42.827 --> 04:47.098
She was sitting at her desk
before she went to the door.

04:50.283 --> 04:52.845
Her laptop is missing.
Is it in there?

04:52.845 --> 04:55.520
Only two things in here with batteries.

04:55.520 --> 04:58.575
None of them's a computer.

04:58.575 --> 05:01.587
It doesn't look like
she had much of a social life.

05:01.587 --> 05:03.011
No makeup.

05:03.011 --> 05:10.114
Her wardrobe's just sweats,
baggy sweaters and T-shirts.

05:10.114 --> 05:12.784
- She tries to play her looks down.
- Hmm.

05:12.784 --> 05:15.347
Her father's a Civil War reenactor.

05:15.347 --> 05:19.242
She likes action.
Kung fu movies from Taiwan.

05:19.242 --> 05:23.041
"Corinne Kennedy. Director of
Software Analysis, Ortech, Inc."

05:23.041 --> 05:25.467
Now she's working at a temp agency.

05:25.467 --> 05:28.018
Pay stub from last week.

05:28.018 --> 05:30.373
Overdue bills.

05:30.373 --> 05:34.442
No wonder she's staying
at home eating crackers.

05:34.442 --> 05:37.074
This is a credit card swiper.

05:37.074 --> 05:40.237
Last year, drugstore clerks
got caught using these...

05:40.237 --> 05:43.176
to steal credit card information from customers.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.871
A high-tech lowlife.

05:45.871 --> 05:48.527
Wonder if her temp agency knew?

05:48.527 --> 05:50.854
M&D Accounting Services Queens
New York, Tuesday, November 4

05:50.854 --> 05:52.396
The agency knows why we let her go.

05:52.396 --> 05:54.385
We found a spyware program on the computer

05:54.385 --> 05:56.291
that she shared with other workstations.

05:56.291 --> 05:57.955
We traced it to her.

05:57.955 --> 05:59.069
She planted it?

05:59.069 --> 06:02.052
Well, she said it must have been a virus.

06:02.052 --> 06:03.467
Oh.

06:03.467 --> 06:06.839
Well, that sounds like a plausible reason.

06:07.459 --> 06:09.703
There was something else,
wasn't there?

06:09.703 --> 06:11.516
I was going downstairs to the Olympia Diner...

06:11.516 --> 06:14.422
when I heard Corinne arguing with
a man on her speakerphone.

06:14.422 --> 06:15.593
What did they say?

06:15.593 --> 06:16.661
Well, I only heard him.

06:16.661 --> 06:19.604
He said, "Watch your back, bitch..." Sorry.

06:19.604 --> 06:21.940
"Or I'll have your head on a stick."

06:21.940 --> 06:25.211
"Your head on a stick." And then what?

06:25.211 --> 06:28.465
That's it.
She seemed out of it, hyper.

06:28.465 --> 06:30.065
I had her computer logs checked.

06:30.065 --> 06:32.112
She was spending a lot of time online.

06:32.112 --> 06:34.792
And then we found the spyware.

06:34.792 --> 06:36.880
You see, the spyware stores
everything we type...

06:36.880 --> 06:40.136
passwords, Social Security numbers...
until it's downloaded.

06:40.136 --> 06:43.488
This exact same program showed up
five days ago at a copy store...

06:43.488 --> 06:47.209
on the main computer that serves
their computer rental stations.

06:47.209 --> 06:49.435
So someone was stealing
data from the customers.

06:49.435 --> 06:52.177
Yeah, passwords and home
computer addresses.

06:52.177 --> 06:55.844
A bank employee woke up to find
someone hacking into his home P.C.

06:55.844 --> 06:58.574
You have any suspects at the copy store?

06:58.574 --> 07:01.214
Seven employees and 42 customers.

07:01.214 --> 07:03.431
Now, this spyware, is this something that

07:03.431 --> 07:05.017
Corinne Kennedy could have created?

07:05.017 --> 07:07.050
Oh, yeah, it's completely
within her skill set.

07:07.050 --> 07:09.301
Excuse me one minute, okay?

07:09.301 --> 07:11.649
I don't see her name on here.

07:11.649 --> 07:16.305
If she created this spyware,
the copy store hacker
might be an accomplice.

07:16.305 --> 07:18.413
The kung fu D.V.D.'s,

07:18.413 --> 07:23.111
one of the stores that sells
those is on Mott Street.

07:24.730 --> 07:28.144
This copy store clerk, Raymond Chan,

07:28.144 --> 07:30.660
he lives right around the corner.

07:30.660 --> 07:33.808
He's erasing the hard drives.

07:33.808 --> 07:35.887
What are you running here,
Raymond?

07:35.887 --> 07:38.582
A group home for computers?

07:38.582 --> 07:39.796
I found the spyware.

07:39.796 --> 07:41.974
That's not mine.
Somebody must've sent me a virus.

07:41.974 --> 07:45.874
Word for word, that's what your
little hacker friend Corinne said.

07:45.874 --> 07:47.819
I don't know who you're talking about.

07:47.819 --> 07:49.159
He skimmed a lot of data.

07:49.159 --> 07:52.992
I'm finding hundreds of credit card
numbers, PI Ns, bank A.T.M.'s.

07:52.992 --> 07:54.936
A.T.M.'s?

07:59.136 --> 08:02.943
You just called him a thief.

08:02.943 --> 08:05.283
You must have some kind of proof.

08:07.305 --> 08:10.838
I went to the A.T.M. Two days ago.

08:10.838 --> 08:14.169
It said my checking account empty.

08:14.169 --> 08:15.351
Eight hundred dollars gone.

08:15.351 --> 08:17.233
Mom, I didn't do it.
I don't steal from banks.

08:17.233 --> 08:20.031
We need to know the name of your bank.

08:20.031 --> 08:22.373
EL Centro Bodega 214 East 110th Street
Thursday, November 6

08:22.373 --> 08:24.178
It's not my machine. I just rent it.

08:24.178 --> 08:25.700
But all I get is people complaining.

08:25.700 --> 08:29.382
No wonder. According to the bank,
33 people who used your machine...

08:29.382 --> 08:32.405
in the last three weeks had money
stolen from their accounts.

08:32.405 --> 08:35.558
Wait a minute. Wait.
This doesn't belong in here.

08:35.558 --> 08:39.216
See, it's coming off the card reader.

08:45.787 --> 08:47.791
It's another circuit board.

08:47.791 --> 08:50.069
It's to skim A.T.M.
And PI N numbers.

08:50.069 --> 08:54.137
Somebody tampered with this
machine before installing it.

08:56.115 --> 08:59.712
Tek-Cash Services. Yonkers.

09:00.332 --> 09:04.346
This $100,000, it's a business
loan from our cousin in Albania.

09:04.346 --> 09:06.901
No. You got the $100,000...

09:06.901 --> 09:11.110
with the help of a friendly
neighborhood crooked A.T.M. Machine.

09:11.110 --> 09:14.540
I don't know about
any crooked friendly machines.

09:14.540 --> 09:17.259
Well, your brother Alexi does.

09:17.259 --> 09:21.687
We found his fingerprints
on this circuit board.

09:23.326 --> 09:25.551
You know what's interesting,
Serge?

09:25.551 --> 09:28.678
Is that the spyware that
you used to skim the A.T.M. Codes...

09:28.678 --> 09:32.804
is the same spyware that
this hacker used to skim passwords.

09:32.804 --> 09:37.008
The same spyware that you
all got from the same person,

09:37.008 --> 09:38.932
Corinne Kennedy.

09:38.932 --> 09:41.153
I don't know him.
I don't know her.

09:41.153 --> 09:44.587
So it's just a coincidence that
she took a header off her balcony...

09:44.587 --> 09:49.789
the same day that you bought
two tickets to Costa Rica?

09:49.789 --> 09:51.859
What tickets?

09:51.859 --> 09:53.861
We found them on your brother's desk.

09:53.861 --> 09:57.604
No, this is impossible.
I wanna talk to my lawyer.

09:58.527 --> 10:01.124
Yes, we bought tickets
to Costa Rica for a vacation.

10:01.124 --> 10:03.293
One-way tickets for a one-way vacation?

10:03.293 --> 10:06.752
Yes, we fly down,
we take a boat back.

10:07.472 --> 10:11.151
Well, you handled that question
much better than your brother did.

10:11.151 --> 10:12.913
So, let's see how you handle this one.

10:12.913 --> 10:15.160
This is from your bank account.

10:15.160 --> 10:16.923
You deposited $100,000.

10:16.923 --> 10:21.063
Now that's the same amount
that was stolen from the A.T.M.

10:21.063 --> 10:25.227
We found it in your brother's office.

10:25.227 --> 10:27.376
My brother? It's...

10:27.376 --> 10:29.813
It's impossible.

10:29.813 --> 10:34.234
Well, there's that word again...
impossible.

10:34.874 --> 10:36.481
This one knows about
the tickets but not the money.

10:36.481 --> 10:40.026
This one knows about
the money but not the tickets.

10:40.026 --> 10:41.983
These clowns can't keep
their stories straight.

10:41.983 --> 10:47.087
They have access codes
to hundreds of bank accounts,

10:47.087 --> 10:50.766
nearly two million dollars.
And they only take 100,000.

10:50.766 --> 10:53.434
- Barely covers their overhead.
- Hmm.

10:53.434 --> 10:56.996
Now, 100,000 is just enough
to catch our attention.

10:56.996 --> 11:01.365
Just enough to, um,
lead us to these two.

11:01.365 --> 11:03.793
They've been set up.

11:04.537 --> 11:08.031
So have we.

11:09.547 --> 11:12.697
The A.T.M. Brothers and Raymond Chan
all said the same thing.

11:12.697 --> 11:15.229
They downloaded the spyware
from a hacker Web site,

11:15.229 --> 11:17.947
which has now disappeared into cyberspace.

11:17.947 --> 11:21.343
Just to be on the safe side,
you have alibis for these guys?

11:21.343 --> 11:28.464
The night Corinne was killed,
Raymond knocked off work at 11:00.

11:28.464 --> 11:30.979
His mother has him home by 12:00.

11:30.979 --> 11:32.720
The brothers are each other's alibi.

11:32.720 --> 11:36.310
In other words, any of them could have done it.

11:38.765 --> 11:40.281
Look, look, look, that's the point.

11:40.281 --> 11:42.124
We're being danced around the ballroom.

11:42.124 --> 11:46.206
The spyware, the card swiper,

11:46.206 --> 11:48.274
the D.V.D.'s, it's smoke.

11:48.274 --> 11:50.055
That threat was not smoke.

11:50.055 --> 11:52.099
Maybe her head wasn't impaled on a stick,

11:52.099 --> 11:55.898
but Miss Kennedy is dead all the same.

11:55.898 --> 12:01.239
Her boss said that she was hyper,
that she was disoriented.

12:03.258 --> 12:07.872
You said maybe her head wasn't impaled on a stick.

12:07.872 --> 12:11.609
She was spending all that time on the Net.

12:11.609 --> 12:18.789
And the false leads,
the planted software...

12:21.323 --> 12:24.635
"Head on a stick."

12:24.635 --> 12:27.025
"Head on a stick," "BloodMatch Arena."

12:27.025 --> 12:29.789
BloodMatch.

12:32.141 --> 12:38.851
"In the arena, he with the most
heads on a stick wins."

12:38.851 --> 12:42.191
Her call was about a computer game?

12:42.191 --> 12:44.154
Yeah. Well, she...

12:44.154 --> 12:47.404
she might have been playing someone
online while she was talking to them.

12:47.404 --> 12:51.813
I can't see her getting
killed over a computer game.

12:51.813 --> 12:54.143
But it might be how she met her killer.

12:54.143 --> 12:56.290
Another player.

12:56.290 --> 12:58.377
Well, I mean, to go online,

12:58.377 --> 13:00.384
you gotta go through a server.

13:00.384 --> 13:01.789
It has to be a big enough computer

13:01.789 --> 13:05.722
to allow several games to be played at once.

13:08.482 --> 13:11.913
The log at her accounting firm,

13:11.913 --> 13:14.443
they might have a record of the one she called.

13:14.443 --> 13:16.804
Gamer's City Server Farm 88 Avenue A
Tuesday, November 11

13:16.804 --> 13:18.912
Our customers don't use their real names.

13:18.912 --> 13:21.592
They make up new identities.
Avatars...

13:21.592 --> 13:25.508
Corinne was online two
Wednesdays ago, around 10:00 p.m.

13:25.508 --> 13:28.548
Can you show us which avatars were playing?

13:29.514 --> 13:32.865
Wednesday,
that would be the 13th.

13:33.383 --> 13:37.935
At 10:00, we had 55 people playing BloodMatch.

13:37.935 --> 13:42.263
"Dragonbyte, Nuclear 72, Taliesin."

13:42.263 --> 13:44.534
Does each player have a profile?

13:44.534 --> 13:47.292
The customer chooses a skin for their avatar.

13:47.292 --> 13:49.225
Can we see the skin for this one?

13:49.225 --> 13:52.482
ShilohAmy. Amy Clarke.

13:52.482 --> 13:54.520
She disguised herself as a Confederate soldier,

13:54.520 --> 13:57.913
so she could fight alongside
her husband during the Battle of Shiloh.

13:57.913 --> 14:01.852
Corinne went to Ole Miss;
her father is a Civil War buff.

14:01.852 --> 14:04.619
This is ShilohAmy's skin.

14:04.619 --> 14:07.482
Yikes!
This is how she saw herself?

14:07.482 --> 14:09.201
Can you show us...

14:09.201 --> 14:14.911
if ShilohAmy was playing Friday,
the night of the 15th?

14:14.911 --> 14:17.142
That night she was playing until 11:25.

14:17.142 --> 14:20.727
When Corinne was killed.
For real.

14:20.727 --> 14:24.714
Does the game record the computer
address of each player?

14:24.714 --> 14:27.330
Well, yes. But you need
to hack the game code to get it.

14:27.330 --> 14:31.635
The guys who designed BloodMatch
made sure it was hack-proof.

14:32.583 --> 14:35.281
Jody told me we had cops visiting us.

14:35.281 --> 14:37.854
They're saying a gamer
got killed by another gamer.

14:37.854 --> 14:41.805
This is Jack Cadogan.
He designed the game with Mr. Colby.

14:41.805 --> 14:45.664
They want access to multiplayer network code.

14:45.664 --> 14:48.584
You didn't agree to this, did you?

14:48.584 --> 14:52.785
Look, I know you're afraid
there's gonna be a witch hunt.

14:52.785 --> 14:56.156
That BloodMatch would
get blamed for inciting violence.

14:56.156 --> 14:59.166
Well, we wouldn't be the first ones.
If it's not the full moon or Twinkies,

14:59.166 --> 15:02.213
it's computer games.
We gotta take a stand here.

15:02.213 --> 15:05.309
This is Ashcroft snooping around in libraries...

15:05.309 --> 15:08.406
A Ferrari?
You got a Ferrari?

15:08.406 --> 15:11.491
A Maranello. I just got it.

15:11.491 --> 15:13.784
I understand what you're saying.

15:13.784 --> 15:15.931
You know, BloodMatch is just a game.

15:15.931 --> 15:19.056
It's cathartic. You get a chance
to get out of your own skin.

15:19.056 --> 15:22.592
Right. It's the best game the world's ever seen.

15:22.592 --> 15:25.837
But just a game.

15:25.837 --> 15:27.520
You know, speaking of skin,

15:27.520 --> 15:31.917
you haven't lost a lot of weight lately, have you?

15:31.917 --> 15:36.878
No, it's just you have
some loose skin under your neck.

15:36.878 --> 15:39.923
How much did you lose?
Like around a hundred pounds?

15:39.923 --> 15:42.499
110. Diet and exercise.

15:42.499 --> 15:44.627
Jack has a lot to be proud of.

15:44.627 --> 15:47.263
I still need you to look at the new polygons.

15:47.263 --> 15:49.166
Our lawyer will get back to you.

15:49.166 --> 15:50.928
Cadogan.

15:50.928 --> 15:54.390
I heard that name in Wales,
but not here.

15:54.390 --> 15:56.841
I think when most families immigrated,

15:56.841 --> 15:58.623
they changed it to Cardigan.

15:58.623 --> 15:59.942
I changed it back.

15:59.942 --> 16:02.454
I didn't like being confused with a sweater.

16:02.454 --> 16:04.560
Excuse me.

16:08.440 --> 16:10.548
Taliesin.

16:10.548 --> 16:14.368
If I were him,
that'd be the name I'd pick.

16:14.368 --> 16:18.185
"Taliesin, a hero of Welsh mythology.

16:18.185 --> 16:21.474
A symbol of transformation and rebirth."

16:21.474 --> 16:23.949
Also the name of an online player.

16:23.949 --> 16:27.613
Then there's Jack Cardigan,
a.k.a. Jack Cadogan.

16:27.613 --> 16:30.682
That's how he looked in
his D.M.V. Photo two years ago.

16:30.682 --> 16:32.238
A hundred and ten pounds heavier.

16:32.238 --> 16:35.890
Then his game became a hit.
He transformed himself.

16:35.890 --> 16:37.412
- A Taliesin.
- Maybe.

16:37.412 --> 16:39.399
I'm online with the game server.

16:39.399 --> 16:44.564
Corinne fought Taliesin in over
300 tournaments in the last four months.

16:44.564 --> 16:47.260
We can watch a replay of the game
she played the night she was killed.

16:47.260 --> 16:49.552
The server keeps them in memory.

16:49.552 --> 16:53.937
There she is.
Here are her opponents.

16:53.937 --> 16:56.831
There's Taliesin.

16:56.831 --> 16:58.612
He was online with her that night.

16:58.612 --> 17:00.100
So, Taliesin, Cadogan,

17:00.100 --> 17:02.551
whatever his name is, has an alibi.
Next theory.

17:02.551 --> 17:04.964
Don't stop it.

17:10.935 --> 17:13.902
That's gotta hurt.

17:13.902 --> 17:16.752
Look how slow he is.
He's getting hit a lot.

17:16.752 --> 17:21.198
The server said he was supposed
to be one of the best players.

17:21.198 --> 17:23.116
He wasn't on the top of his game that night.

17:23.116 --> 17:25.838
Loser.

17:25.838 --> 17:28.615
We need an expert opinion.

17:28.615 --> 17:30.373
Have you even looked at the new wall polygons?

17:30.373 --> 17:32.867
The shadow intensities are
tracking with the light source now.

17:32.867 --> 17:33.648
I'll check it later.

17:33.648 --> 17:36.764
Jack, you're getting too preoccupied.
Remember Ginny?

17:36.764 --> 17:39.942
And now with these online gamers,
they're unstable.

17:39.942 --> 17:43.191
We gotta keep a distance between us and them.

17:43.191 --> 17:45.073
Everything you need is here.

17:45.073 --> 17:47.974
Out there is just un-engineered chaos.

17:47.974 --> 17:50.409
Chaos is underrated, Neil.

17:50.409 --> 17:55.064
Welcome to BloodMatch Arena.
Five tournaments are in progress.

17:55.064 --> 18:00.001
Join one now...
or recruit players for a new one.

18:00.001 --> 18:01.763
Taliesin was getting creamed.

18:01.763 --> 18:04.095
He normally averages 96 frags per game.

18:04.095 --> 18:06.243
That night he barely managed 23.

18:06.243 --> 18:08.180
Whoa! Look at those gibs fly!

18:08.180 --> 18:10.124
What could account for his slow playing?

18:10.124 --> 18:14.755
Could he have programmed some kind
of automatic pilot for his avatar?

18:14.755 --> 18:16.121
Sure, it's called a bot.

18:16.121 --> 18:17.229
You mean robot?

18:17.229 --> 18:19.764
I mean a bot. It mimics a human player.

18:19.764 --> 18:23.462
Gamers use them for practice.

18:27.283 --> 18:29.248
Or to create alibis.

18:29.248 --> 18:32.169
That's gotta hurt.

18:32.169 --> 18:36.878
While Corinne thought she was
playing Taliesin online,

18:36.878 --> 18:38.719
he was ringing her doorbell.

18:38.719 --> 18:41.661
A computer geek who can clone himself.

18:41.661 --> 18:44.531
Scary thought.

18:46.269 --> 18:50.353
He used the bot to keep Corinne
pinned down at home on her computer.

18:50.353 --> 18:53.307
That's assuming Cadogan
is this Taliesin character.

18:53.307 --> 18:57.067
He has the technological chops
to pull it off, to create the spyware...

18:57.067 --> 19:01.481
and the hacker Web site that
Raymond and the brothers accessed.

19:01.481 --> 19:04.305
And if they downloaded the spyware,

19:04.305 --> 19:09.442
then he would have been able to
set them up as murder suspects.

19:11.264 --> 19:13.554
Deakins.

19:13.554 --> 19:16.466
Thank you, counselor.
I'll let 'em know.

19:16.466 --> 19:18.144
That was Carver.

19:18.144 --> 19:22.237
BloodMatch Studios decided
not to challenge the subpoena.

19:22.237 --> 19:24.400
Office Of Neil Colby 226 GreenWich Street
Thursday, November13

19:24.400 --> 19:28.685
BloodMatch Two,
blasting your way this summer.

19:28.685 --> 19:29.773
The sequel's already out?

19:29.773 --> 19:33.339
No. We pushed back the release date to Christmas.

19:33.339 --> 19:37.845
I see that you're pulling a lot of
overnighters on that couch, but your...

19:37.845 --> 19:41.695
Well, others aren't.
Maybe your partner...

19:41.695 --> 19:44.925
It's different for me.
My wife works here.

19:44.925 --> 19:46.726
Everything I need is here.

19:46.726 --> 19:49.202
What about Friday night,
two weeks ago, was he out?

19:49.202 --> 19:52.901
I don't know.
I was working with the door closed.

19:52.901 --> 19:55.327
Here, you're in.

19:56.783 --> 19:59.095
ShilohAmy.

19:59.095 --> 20:03.145
Her address is the same as
Corinne's computer address.

20:03.145 --> 20:06.964
And here is Taliesin's.

20:06.964 --> 20:09.673
Jack played online.
That's normal.

20:09.673 --> 20:12.230
He's testing the game.

20:12.230 --> 20:15.151
Any way to check who else
he might have been playing with?

20:15.151 --> 20:18.586
Uh, type "find," "slash,"

20:18.586 --> 20:22.363
his I.P. Address,
and then press "Enter."

20:22.363 --> 20:23.879
Damn.

20:23.879 --> 20:27.004
Something wrong?

20:27.004 --> 20:30.468
Goofy monster behavior.

20:30.468 --> 20:35.058
Um, the programmer who writes
the code for the imps,

20:35.058 --> 20:37.148
every time they jump over a puddle,

20:37.148 --> 20:41.902
he has them take two skips with
the right foot and one with the left.

20:41.902 --> 20:43.376
It's idiosyncratic.

20:43.376 --> 20:47.787
Every programmer has their
own bit of inelegant code.

20:47.787 --> 20:51.223
- Their own signature.
- Mm-hmm.

20:54.065 --> 20:56.617
You find it beautiful.

20:56.617 --> 20:59.865
The code, I mean.

20:59.865 --> 21:01.930
I like it.

21:01.930 --> 21:06.185
If it achieves what I want
in the cleanest way possible.

21:06.889 --> 21:09.647
Neil, who is KillerBarbi?

21:09.647 --> 21:13.710
She was Jack's regular opponent
up till four months ago.

21:13.710 --> 21:18.163
Her I.P. Address is the same as
the company's computer network.

21:18.163 --> 21:21.811
KillerBarbi, that was Ginny Carlotta.

21:21.811 --> 21:25.087
Any idea why, uh,
they stopped playing?

21:25.087 --> 21:29.350
I guess because she quit the company.

21:29.350 --> 21:32.687
It didn't have anything to do with Jack.
I quit because I got into Parsons.

21:32.687 --> 21:35.709
But you and Jack spent a lot of
time playing BloodMatch.

21:35.709 --> 21:39.062
- You were close?
- Well, yeah. Why?

21:39.062 --> 21:42.961
The last girl Jack spent hours
playing with ended up dead.

21:42.961 --> 21:46.733
You think Jack?
Jack's a teddy bear.

21:46.733 --> 21:49.857
He was a big teddy bear
when you were working there.

21:49.857 --> 21:52.681
- Did he do the chasing?
- He was too shy for that.

21:52.681 --> 21:55.382
The person who hired me, Jody, Neil's wife,

21:55.382 --> 21:57.756
she saw that I had a minor in music.

21:57.756 --> 21:59.431
She told me Jack was learning to write music.

21:59.431 --> 22:01.193
She thought I could help.

22:01.193 --> 22:02.131
Is that what he's like?

22:02.131 --> 22:05.755
When he has an interest in something...
he dedicates himself to it,

22:05.755 --> 22:08.290
like music?
Losing weight?

22:08.290 --> 22:11.600
He made all this money.
And he wanted to, you know,

22:11.600 --> 22:13.871
try new things,
open himself up,

22:13.871 --> 22:15.898
drive around the world.

22:15.898 --> 22:17.650
He sounds like a passionate guy.

22:17.650 --> 22:20.723
Real passionate.
He thought games can help people,

22:20.723 --> 22:23.245
so he designed a game
for learning-disabled kids,

22:23.245 --> 22:26.595
like my brother.
That's what he's playing.

22:29.967 --> 22:32.358
When you make him jump and shoot,

22:32.358 --> 22:35.298
he flips and shoots three times.

22:35.298 --> 22:36.611
Do you make him do that?

22:36.611 --> 22:39.471
No, he's programmed that way.

22:39.471 --> 22:41.874
You said that Jack designed this game.
Did he program it too?

22:41.874 --> 22:43.433
Yes.

22:43.433 --> 22:47.254
Jump, flip, three shots.

22:48.282 --> 22:50.225
It's Jack Cadogan's signature move.

22:50.225 --> 22:53.547
His character did it in every
game he fought against Corinne,

22:53.547 --> 22:55.576
except the bot game.

22:55.576 --> 22:58.499
Someone else programmed that bot, not Jack.

22:58.499 --> 23:02.190
Somebody else made the bot
that was supposed to be Jack's alibi.

23:02.190 --> 23:05.111
Mm-hmm.
An alibi that didn't hold up.

23:05.111 --> 23:09.663
Maybe by design, someone trying to
throw the suspicion on Jack.

23:09.663 --> 23:12.057
When we catch this guy,
he's gonna owe me a bottle of aspirin.

23:12.057 --> 23:18.993
So far, we found when the, uh,
bot kills its opponent with a knife...

23:18.993 --> 23:24.373
It strikes once in the neck, the thigh,
two to the chest.

23:24.373 --> 23:26.294
One, one, two.

23:26.294 --> 23:27.937
Got ya, monkey brain.

23:27.937 --> 23:29.998
It's in the Clan of the Assassins level.

23:29.998 --> 23:32.168
All the bad guys use the same
pattern of knife strikes.

23:32.168 --> 23:34.035
One, one, two.

23:34.035 --> 23:36.325
Well, see if you can find
the programmer of that level.

23:36.325 --> 23:37.701
Maybe he left an Easter egg.

23:37.701 --> 23:39.278
Let me look.

23:39.278 --> 23:43.873
Programmers, they sometimes leave,
uh, surprises.

23:43.873 --> 23:46.705
You know, their names,
pictures of their dogs.

23:46.705 --> 23:48.793
Found it.

23:52.060 --> 23:55.921
Abe McVee, one of the founders of BloodMatch.

23:55.921 --> 23:59.187
Left the company just after the game's release.

23:59.187 --> 24:02.456
He filed a suit a year ago for
breach of their partnership agreement.

24:02.456 --> 24:05.193
Here. Someone's dragging him into court.

24:05.193 --> 24:07.957
McVee v. McVee.

24:07.957 --> 24:10.286
Family court.

24:10.286 --> 24:13.598
He sounds like a sweetheart.

24:13.598 --> 24:16.687
I said it would be ready before Christmas.

24:17.834 --> 24:21.473
Yes, everyone's in crunch mode,

24:21.473 --> 24:23.048
even Jack.

24:23.048 --> 24:26.970
He's grinding harder than anyone.

24:26.970 --> 24:29.100
I've got code to write.

24:29.100 --> 24:31.368
Why don't you tell them the truth?

24:31.368 --> 24:33.726
He'll be back.

24:33.726 --> 24:37.011
I've gotta work on the wall polygons.

24:37.011 --> 24:41.282
- I saw them. They're fine.
- I need to tweak them.

24:44.898 --> 24:48.126
I'll be home later.

24:53.676 --> 24:58.570
When we formed the company,
Neil and Jack made two rules.

24:58.570 --> 25:01.080
Anyone could be voted out at any time.

25:01.080 --> 25:03.077
Once you're out,
you lose all your shares.

25:03.077 --> 25:05.125
Whose idea was it to vote you out?

25:05.125 --> 25:06.928
Neil's.

25:06.928 --> 25:08.665
He said I wasn't working hard enough.

25:08.665 --> 25:10.612
I was trying to hold my marriage together.

25:10.612 --> 25:13.147
Jack, he didn't stand up for you?

25:13.147 --> 25:14.584
I was floored.

25:14.584 --> 25:16.915
Those guys were nothing until
I introduced them.

25:16.915 --> 25:19.040
They owed you.

25:19.040 --> 25:22.391
Feelings of entitlement, you know,

25:22.391 --> 25:24.035
they... they can justify bad behavior.

25:24.035 --> 25:26.077
I was within my rights to sue.

25:26.077 --> 25:27.449
I'm sure you were.

25:27.449 --> 25:30.562
You did great work on the game,
like Clan of the Assassins.

25:30.562 --> 25:33.056
The way they wield their knives.

25:33.056 --> 25:35.398
One to the neck, one to the thigh,
two to the chest.

25:35.398 --> 25:38.895
We didn't find any other
game character who behaved that way.

25:38.895 --> 25:41.735
Well, we did find one.

25:41.735 --> 25:44.106
See, this guy?

25:44.106 --> 25:46.553
That's a bot of Jack's character.

25:46.553 --> 25:52.704
Watch how he stabs.
One, one, two.

25:52.704 --> 25:55.140
That's just like your assassins.

25:55.140 --> 25:56.717
Yeah, but I didn't program this.

25:56.717 --> 26:00.599
We think you did to implicate Jack in a murder.

26:00.599 --> 26:03.320
What?
Why in the hell would I do that?

26:03.320 --> 26:05.097
Entitlement. They cheated you.

26:05.097 --> 26:08.143
Look, one, one, two.

26:08.143 --> 26:10.742
That's not true. Because when Jack
found out about the lawsuit,

26:10.742 --> 26:14.529
- he paid me out of his own pocket.
- I'm sure he did.

26:18.958 --> 26:21.354
Boy, I bet your wife
would like to know about that, huh?

26:21.354 --> 26:22.689
Because according to this paper,

26:22.689 --> 26:25.099
you're 20 grand short of your child support.

26:25.099 --> 26:26.162
- No, I'm not.
- What's the matter?

26:26.162 --> 26:29.043
Your lawsuit wasn't going well for you, huh?

26:29.043 --> 26:30.692
- So you had to hurt your family,
- No, I didn't

26:30.692 --> 26:31.875
- is that what it is?
- No, I told you...

26:31.875 --> 26:33.454
- Lashed out at Jack?
- Jack paid me!

26:33.454 --> 26:36.114
Lashed out at your wife?

26:36.114 --> 26:38.098
He didn't want me to tell anyone.

26:38.098 --> 26:40.444
He didn't want Neil to find out.

26:40.444 --> 26:42.408
And my wife, that's all settled.

26:42.408 --> 26:45.698
Her lawyer just hasn't filed the papers yet.

26:46.581 --> 26:50.204
I'm telling you the truth.
Call my wife.

26:55.758 --> 27:02.389
Uh...
Croydon.

27:07.187 --> 27:09.256
Croydon.

27:09.256 --> 27:11.060
McVee is another Croydon.

27:11.060 --> 27:14.218
- Who's Croydon?
- He ran out on his wife.

27:14.218 --> 27:18.491
Hitchens used him to get at me.

27:18.491 --> 27:24.715
And the pattern,
one, one, two, it's Wally Stevens.

27:24.715 --> 27:26.373
I don't know who you're talking about.

27:26.373 --> 27:27.932
He was an actuary.

27:27.932 --> 27:33.800
He had a pattern of five.
Five notes. Five... pins.

27:35.968 --> 27:37.913
Eames would've known.

27:37.913 --> 27:40.795
Wait. I'm not following.

27:40.795 --> 27:44.190
What do you want us to do with McVee?

27:45.811 --> 27:49.464
We'll send him home.

27:49.464 --> 27:53.099
And give him my apologies.

28:19.003 --> 28:21.046
Neil.

28:25.234 --> 28:27.846
It's Neil.

28:30.955 --> 28:34.753
It's about yearning.

28:36.044 --> 28:40.312
He misses his partner.

28:44.846 --> 28:47.461
Jack never told Neil he settled with McVee.

28:47.461 --> 28:50.585
As far as Neil knew,
McVee still had a beef with Jack.

28:50.585 --> 28:52.183
Making him the perfect fall guy.

28:52.183 --> 28:55.091
And somehow Mr. Colby tampered with this bot

28:55.091 --> 28:57.148
- to implicate Mr. McVee?
- Right.

28:57.148 --> 28:59.833
Bot's game has been sitting
in the server's memory all this time.

28:59.833 --> 29:02.042
Once Neil found out who he was dealing with...

29:02.042 --> 29:04.476
Meaning you.

29:04.476 --> 29:06.808
He could've hacked in,

29:06.808 --> 29:10.647
reprogrammed the bot
to simulate McVee's work.

29:10.647 --> 29:13.303
My assistant checked with Westlaw.

29:13.303 --> 29:17.456
Testimony from your actuary,
Walter Stevens's trial...

29:17.456 --> 29:21.440
was downloaded last week to a computer...

29:21.440 --> 29:23.117
at a public library.

29:23.117 --> 29:25.430
The testimony dealt with your predilection...

29:25.430 --> 29:28.537
for detecting obscure patterns.

29:28.537 --> 29:32.321
Far as your predilection for
hounding deadbeat dads,

29:32.321 --> 29:35.487
all anyone had to do was read
a couple of old newspapers.

29:35.487 --> 29:37.997
I'll grant you the how,
but the why?

29:37.997 --> 29:42.100
Neil might have been jealous of
the time Jack spent online with Corinne.

29:42.100 --> 29:45.387
He killed her to drive
his partner back into his arms?

29:45.387 --> 29:48.668
- That's almostjuvenile.
- It's primitive.

29:48.668 --> 29:51.652
Panic is a primitive emotion.

29:51.652 --> 29:56.130
That's how he felt without his partner.

29:56.130 --> 29:58.526
Home of Neil & Jody Colby
14 West 72Nd Street
Monday, November 17

29:58.526 --> 30:01.691
Murder? Neil didn't tell me
you suspected Jack of murder.

30:01.691 --> 30:02.737
Not surprising.

30:02.737 --> 30:07.208
Your husband offered up a pretty
vigorous defense of his partner.

30:07.208 --> 30:09.679
He thinks the world of Jack.

30:09.679 --> 30:10.993
Jack is very dependent on him.

30:10.993 --> 30:14.424
That's why you wanted to pry Jack away from him.

30:14.424 --> 30:16.111
Where did you get that idea?

30:16.111 --> 30:19.352
Ginny Carlotta.

30:19.352 --> 30:24.334
You saw she had a minor in music.
I don't know, she was cute and...

30:24.334 --> 30:26.363
lf Jack became interested in her,

30:26.363 --> 30:30.140
maybe he'd be less interested
in monopolizing your husband's time.

30:30.140 --> 30:32.753
Neil's a hundred times the programmer Jack is.

30:32.753 --> 30:34.792
He was creating his own games before he met Jack.

30:34.792 --> 30:37.410
He doesn't need Jack.

30:37.410 --> 30:39.290
He needs you.

30:39.290 --> 30:41.476
Right? Maybe with Jack out of the way,

30:41.476 --> 30:45.560
that would become more clear for him.

30:45.560 --> 30:49.259
Uh, the Ginny Carlotta gambit,

30:49.259 --> 30:52.770
that worked out well for... for Jack, huh?

30:52.770 --> 30:57.343
You know, new girlfriend and new interests.

30:57.343 --> 30:58.901
How'd that work out for you?

30:58.901 --> 31:02.102
- It's been fine.
- Yeah? Good.

31:02.102 --> 31:04.238
'Cause there's one coffee cup and one bowl.

31:04.238 --> 31:05.937
He's not eating breakfast here anymore.

31:05.937 --> 31:09.413
And I think he's working the same
amount of time as he was before...

31:09.413 --> 31:13.678
But the new game isn't getting done.

31:14.850 --> 31:19.939
Well, maybe he needs Jack after all.

31:19.939 --> 31:23.674
He just thinks he does.

31:23.674 --> 31:26.780
He's stuck on the code for the wall polygons.

31:26.780 --> 31:28.417
I keep telling him they're fine.

31:28.417 --> 31:31.633
But unless Jack's around
to tell him something's good enough,

31:31.633 --> 31:33.732
he can't move on.

31:33.732 --> 31:36.815
Because he's not there.

31:36.815 --> 31:39.636
Because of, uh, Ginny?

31:39.636 --> 31:41.130
Because of you?

31:41.130 --> 31:42.890
So is that why you're here?

31:42.890 --> 31:45.396
- Listen to me.
- To rub my nose in it?

31:45.396 --> 31:47.543
No. I wanted to ask you a question.

31:47.543 --> 31:50.996
If you knew if he ever ordered takeout...

31:50.996 --> 31:54.221
from an Olympia Diner in Queens?

31:54.221 --> 31:57.306
It would've been the night of the 14th.

31:57.306 --> 31:59.028
I don't know. Why?

31:59.028 --> 32:02.662
We just have this,
uh, credit card charge.

32:02.662 --> 32:07.719
The Olympia Diner is downstairs from
where the murdered girl works.

32:07.719 --> 32:10.094
And, well, if, you know,

32:10.094 --> 32:14.743
Jack had dinner with her
the night before she was killed,

32:14.743 --> 32:16.869
that wouldn't look good for Jack.

32:16.869 --> 32:21.120
I'm sorry.
I don't know anything about it.

32:22.064 --> 32:23.905
What credit card charge from the Olympia?

32:23.905 --> 32:26.625
Neil Colby's worst nightmare.

32:26.625 --> 32:29.224
They have a receipt for the night
before that girl was killed.

32:29.224 --> 32:30.905
No, I don't believe it.

32:30.905 --> 32:33.625
I saw it.
He must have done it, Neil.

32:33.625 --> 32:35.771
You can't be mixed up with him anymore.

32:35.771 --> 32:37.571
Stop it.

32:37.571 --> 32:39.720
He's not coming back.

32:39.720 --> 32:41.560
He's going to jail.

32:41.560 --> 32:44.806
Get used to it.

32:49.601 --> 32:52.401
But Miss Kennedy was no longer
working for the accounting firm then.

32:52.401 --> 32:54.427
She'd been fired.

32:54.427 --> 32:57.227
Well, as far as Neil knows,

32:57.227 --> 32:58.642
she was still working,

32:58.642 --> 33:02.888
using the same computer that
he hacked into to plant the spyware.

33:02.888 --> 33:06.563
The spyware that made it seem she's
part of the credit card fraud ring.

33:06.563 --> 33:13.107
Yes. And now Neil might have to
do a little more hacking.

33:13.107 --> 33:15.987
You see, um, he thinks...

33:15.987 --> 33:20.824
that we have proof that,
uh, Jack was in the diner.

33:20.824 --> 33:24.908
So now he has to create evidence
that Corinne wasn't.

33:24.908 --> 33:29.048
So, we wait for him to make his move, right?

33:29.048 --> 33:33.583
That depends how comfortable
you are with having Jack arrested.

33:33.583 --> 33:36.804
Neil has a-a big...

33:36.804 --> 33:42.777
red panic button that really
needs to be pushed hard.

33:42.777 --> 33:44.965
Maybe the problem is this space.

33:44.965 --> 33:46.950
It's too big.

33:46.950 --> 33:48.507
Do you remember the dump?

33:48.507 --> 33:50.880
I remember picking cockroaches out of my keyboard.

33:50.880 --> 33:54.270
But it was just you, me and McVee. Things got done.

33:54.270 --> 33:57.169
You fired McVee.

33:57.169 --> 33:59.296
Oh, look who's here.

33:59.296 --> 34:00.556
You mind standing up, Mr. Cadogan?

34:00.556 --> 34:02.827
You're under arrest for the murder of Corinne Kennedy.

34:02.827 --> 34:05.127
- Who?
- You'd know her as Shiloh Amy.

34:05.127 --> 34:07.163
Amy's dead?
I don't know anything about this.

34:07.163 --> 34:08.960
- I never even met her.
- Neil didn't tell you we suspected you?

34:08.960 --> 34:10.774
- You knew?
- I didn't tell you because it was a distraction.

34:10.774 --> 34:16.233
- There's nothing to it.
- Nothing? I'm being arrested!

34:23.929 --> 34:25.954
Arraignment Court, Friday, November 21

34:25.954 --> 34:29.206
Docket number 7247,
People versus Jack Cadogan,

34:29.206 --> 34:31.815
second degree murder.

34:31.815 --> 34:35.351
Mr. Carver,
are the People ready to proceed?

34:35.351 --> 34:37.553
Yes, Your Honor. At this time
the People are dismissing

34:37.553 --> 34:40.708
the murder charge against
Mr. Cadogan, sua sponte.

34:40.708 --> 34:44.260
Mr. Cadogan, you are free to go.

34:44.260 --> 34:46.039
I don't know if we're out of the woods yet.

34:46.039 --> 34:47.536
I'll call you.

34:47.536 --> 34:48.873
You okay?
What happened in there?

34:48.873 --> 34:50.309
The cops messed up.

34:50.309 --> 34:51.630
They thought I met up with the dead girl,

34:51.630 --> 34:54.926
- but they found out she was working.
- So everything's cool?

34:54.926 --> 34:56.176
We can get back to work.

34:56.176 --> 34:59.060
Look, Neil, I'm not sure.

34:59.060 --> 35:01.940
Not sure of what?
They made a mistake.

35:01.940 --> 35:04.303
The mistake's been corrected.
You move on.

35:04.303 --> 35:06.374
That's what I'm doing.

35:06.374 --> 35:08.094
Thanks for coming, Jody.

35:08.094 --> 35:09.673
You can't. I caught your back.

35:09.673 --> 35:11.432
What are you talking about?

35:11.432 --> 35:13.813
You just owe me.

35:15.613 --> 35:18.863
Well, that's not much of an answer, Neil.

35:18.863 --> 35:23.286
Uh, you need a few days.
I get it.

35:23.286 --> 35:27.493
Um, I'll call you next week.

35:27.493 --> 35:32.186
Well, that might be a little difficult
getting reception in the German Alps.

35:32.186 --> 35:35.372
Especially going 150 miles an hour.

35:35.372 --> 35:37.111
What is he saying?

35:37.111 --> 35:40.974
AirCar Transport.

35:41.549 --> 35:46.121
Jack's having his Ferrari
flown to Munich this weekend.

35:46.121 --> 35:48.695
Yep, going on a road trip.

35:48.695 --> 35:51.351
I was going to tell you.

35:51.351 --> 35:53.234
How long you plan on being gone?

35:53.234 --> 35:55.686
Two months.

35:55.686 --> 35:58.620
Jack,

35:58.620 --> 36:04.863
isn't that what you told the AirCar people?

36:04.863 --> 36:10.842
It's just, you know,
driving a car on a monitor...

36:10.842 --> 36:14.333
uh, computers...
is different than the Autobahn.

36:14.333 --> 36:16.495
And a real girl, you know,

36:16.495 --> 36:18.156
quivering like pudding next to you in the seat...

36:18.156 --> 36:20.552
I've gotta do this, Neil.

36:20.552 --> 36:23.160
I'm driving all the way to Italy.
And then, who knows?

36:23.160 --> 36:24.154
It's something you should think of doing.

36:24.154 --> 36:26.848
You can't.
We'll never get the game done.

36:26.848 --> 36:29.652
We have... We've got to deliver the game.

36:29.652 --> 36:31.371
Don't spoil it for him, Neil.

36:31.371 --> 36:33.452
Come on. This is his coming-out party.

36:33.452 --> 36:37.525
What he's been building up to ever
since Ginny floated into his life.

36:37.525 --> 36:40.175
You know, if it wasn't for her,
you know,

36:40.175 --> 36:43.014
he'd still be the overweight geek...

36:43.014 --> 36:48.696
spending his every waking
moment with his best buddy.

36:50.521 --> 36:53.327
She split the two of you apart.

36:57.082 --> 37:00.688
No, it's like Yoko.

37:00.688 --> 37:02.814
No, no, it is. With, uh...

37:02.814 --> 37:05.797
With, uh, Paul and John.

37:05.797 --> 37:10.503
Dude, she... she was an airhead.
Hiring her, it was a mistake.

37:10.503 --> 37:13.821
There was no mistake.
Ask your wife.

37:13.821 --> 37:17.757
I mean, there's your Yoko.

37:17.757 --> 37:20.639
Neil, I thought I could be
for you what Jack was.

37:20.639 --> 37:22.147
You have no idea what you did.

37:22.147 --> 37:26.048
Neil, don't be so hard on her.

37:26.048 --> 37:27.685
Come on.

37:27.685 --> 37:33.618
Yoko, no Yoko, John was
on his way out, just like Jack.

37:35.276 --> 37:37.591
But you weren't ready to let go...

37:37.591 --> 37:42.394
because, you know,
you remembered...

37:42.394 --> 37:47.066
the first time that you
designed a game on your own.

37:47.066 --> 37:50.618
Let me just read the reviews.

37:50.618 --> 37:53.580
I have them. Uh...

37:53.580 --> 37:55.728
"Duller than Pong."

37:55.728 --> 37:59.748
"A game only a robot would love."

37:59.748 --> 38:02.404
"Neil Colby's game has the moves,

38:02.404 --> 38:05.974
but not the heart...

38:05.974 --> 38:07.979
of a great game."

38:07.979 --> 38:11.899
Hey, come on.
Leave the guy alone.

38:11.899 --> 38:18.711
You were stuck. Right?
All the beautiful code that you wrote...

38:19.899 --> 38:24.392
I don't know, it meant nothing
unless Jack said it meant something.

38:24.392 --> 38:27.679
Because he's your only audience.

38:27.679 --> 38:34.406
He's the only opinion...
that you've ever trusted.

38:36.146 --> 38:38.601
You're overstating it.

38:38.601 --> 38:42.255
You needed Jack back, you know.

38:42.255 --> 38:44.709
Cleanest way possible.

38:44.709 --> 38:50.155
Eliminate the distraction that
kept him from his work.

38:50.155 --> 38:53.099
Shiloh Amy.

38:58.403 --> 39:02.345
No. You people are insane
if you think I killed that girl.

39:02.345 --> 39:07.896
Killed her and wrapped her up in
a nice little story about credit card fraud.

39:07.896 --> 39:13.971
Oh, yeah. He-He did all this
to get you back in the fold.

39:14.735 --> 39:21.369
Can you imagine the panic...
when we started closing in on you?

39:21.369 --> 39:26.153
He sent us chasing after Abe McVee.

39:26.153 --> 39:29.541
Neil, it's not true, is it?

39:29.541 --> 39:34.114
First they blame Jack, and then
they go after McVee, and now me?

39:34.114 --> 39:36.423
You're all over the place.

39:36.423 --> 39:38.123
Let's get out of here.

39:38.123 --> 39:42.651
Jack had a question that you haven't answered...

39:42.651 --> 39:44.268
how you caught his back.

39:44.268 --> 39:46.911
- I meant at work.
- No, you didn't.

39:46.911 --> 39:49.024
You want us to tell him what you meant?

39:49.024 --> 39:51.918
These logs from Corinne's work computer show

39:51.918 --> 39:55.019
she was at work when she was supposed
to be at the Olympia Diner with you.

39:55.019 --> 39:56.411
I was never at that diner.

39:56.411 --> 39:59.839
I know that.
But we... we told Jody that you were.

39:59.839 --> 40:01.642
Corinne was never at work that night.

40:01.642 --> 40:03.886
She'd been fired.

40:03.886 --> 40:07.810
But now, miraculously,
the log says that she was at work.

40:07.810 --> 40:09.331
Because some good Samaritan...

40:09.331 --> 40:15.304
hacked into the accounting firm's
computer last night and altered the log.

40:19.080 --> 40:23.004
But this time we watched.

40:23.004 --> 40:30.123
All I did was change the record...

40:30.123 --> 40:33.451
to protect Jack.

40:34.824 --> 40:38.720
I thought you were going to jail.

40:38.720 --> 40:40.886
It's not what you did, Neil.

40:40.886 --> 40:42.688
It's how you did it.

40:42.688 --> 40:44.979
You hacked in using the same back door...

40:44.979 --> 40:48.225
the killer used to put
the spyware on Corinne's computer,

40:48.225 --> 40:52.554
except this time,
instead of spending two days hacking passwords,

40:52.554 --> 40:56.065
you did it on the first try.

40:56.065 --> 40:59.411
Oh, my God, Neil.

40:59.411 --> 41:02.640
I didn't kill his damn girlfriend.

41:02.640 --> 41:04.926
Girlfriend?

41:07.073 --> 41:09.274
She's not your girlfriend,
is she, Jack?

41:09.274 --> 41:12.379
I told you. I never met her.

41:12.379 --> 41:16.643
I didn't even know her name.

41:18.668 --> 41:21.833
She was just a gamer.

41:21.833 --> 41:25.507
Just a gamer?

41:25.507 --> 41:29.954
Your partner let a gamer
come between the two of you.

41:29.954 --> 41:33.077
If my partner was putting me through that,

41:33.077 --> 41:35.782
abandoning me,

41:35.782 --> 41:40.502
leaving me vulnerable,

41:40.502 --> 41:42.737
impotent,

41:42.737 --> 41:48.532
for a nobody...

41:48.532 --> 41:51.209
That's unforgivable.

41:51.209 --> 41:55.067
Geez, dude,
what the hell did you do?

41:55.067 --> 41:59.412
You bastard.
I was looking out for us.

42:02.007 --> 42:06.619
And she was just a gamer?

42:06.619 --> 42:09.437
We've got millions of gamers.

42:09.437 --> 42:12.176
There's only one us.

42:12.176 --> 42:15.687
I should have killed you instead.

42:15.687 --> 42:18.019
Come on, Neil.

42:19.150 --> 42:21.498
You're under arrest.

42:33.076 --> 42:36.409
I didn't see it.

42:36.409 --> 42:39.469
Neil and... Me and Neil, we just, uh...

42:39.469 --> 42:43.122
we wanted to make a cool game.

42:48.202 --> 42:52.264
They ended up with a game
that neither of them can play.

42:58.202 --> 43:00.039
Seven pounds, eight ounces.

43:00.039 --> 43:02.635
Excellent.

43:02.635 --> 43:06.152
It's great.
You... You should call her.

43:06.152 --> 43:09.194
I'll handle the booking.
