most of the talking.

38:00.412 --> 38:02.012
He wasn't an unhappy child.

38:02.014 --> 38:04.648
I'm sure he wasn't.

38:04.650 --> 38:08.718
In fact, there's a boy out there
who made him very happy.

38:09.755 --> 38:13.023
You think that Jamal is
so different from you,

38:13.025 --> 38:16.793
but you're the same in
the most important way of all.

38:18.563 --> 38:21.898
You both loved your son more
than anything in this world.

I'm so sorry, Victor.

38:57.903 --> 38:59.469
[ Crying ]
I'm so sorry.

39:02.874 --> 39:04.841
Did he know you loved him?

39:06.345 --> 39:07.911
I think so.

39:09.448 --> 39:10.647
Good.

[ Chuckles ]

39:37.509 --> 39:39.476
Explain this world to me, mama.

39:40.912 --> 39:42.746
You know what a covenant is?

39:44.916 --> 39:47.050
It's a sacred agreement.

39:47.052 --> 39:50.754
People come here
at their very worst,

39:50.756 --> 39:52.956
which means that no matter what,

39:52.958 --> 39:56.126
we have to be at our very best.

39:56.128 --> 39:58.795
No one said it was easy.

39:59.731 --> 40:02.832
That's the covenant.

40:21.720 --> 40:23.853
You'd already
diagnosed yourself.

40:23.855 --> 40:26.556
That's why you came to me.

40:30.762 --> 40:32.595
I feel awful.

40:33.865 --> 40:35.732
I just...

40:36.968 --> 40:40.203
Seeing you again, I was trying
to keep my emotions out of it.

40:40.205 --> 40:41.971
I wasn't at my best.

40:41.973 --> 40:44.607
Why'd you come up here?

40:44.609 --> 40:45.642
To find me?

40:45.644 --> 40:48.011
This is where it all started.

40:50.982 --> 40:53.917
You were so scandalized.

40:53.919 --> 40:56.820
You were a senior resident,
and I was...

40:56.822 --> 40:58.755
You were nervous.

41:00.992 --> 41:02.926
It was adorable.

41:09.067 --> 41:11.167
I didn't think
there could be anything worse

41:11.169 --> 41:14.771
than saying goodbye to you.

41:14.773 --> 41:16.840
This is definitely worse.

41:27.919 --> 41:30.119
How's my partner doing?

41:30.121 --> 41:31.654
He's stable.

41:32.691 --> 41:34.657
And the kid
that got hit by the stray?

41:34.659 --> 41:36.526
He's gonna pull through.

41:38.864 --> 41:40.497
And the shooter?

41:41.500 --> 41:42.966
You afraid of what he might say?

41:42.968 --> 41:45.001
Look, whatever you're thinking,

41:45.003 --> 41:47.804
whatever they're thinking
out there, that's not it.

41:50.075 --> 41:53.610
I took money from a guy
that you don't take money from.

41:55.146 --> 41:57.580
He said he would come for me.

41:59.150 --> 42:00.884
And he did.

42:03.822 --> 42:06.089
He's dead.

So, it's up to<i> you</i> whether
you tell the truth or not.

42:11.897 --> 42:13.763
But I'll tell you this...

42:13.765 --> 42:16.099
The guilt never goes away.

42:18.036 --> 42:20.670
I'll let you get some rest.

42:21.740 --> 42:22.939
Leanne.

42:25.076 --> 42:27.310
What do<i> you</i> have
to feel guilty about?

That I survived.
