01:42.533 --> 01:43.733
>> I KEPT PUTTING MOSQUITOS IN

01:43.733 --> 01:44.600
HIS HOUSE.

01:47.500 --> 01:48.533
HE ALWAYS LEAVES HIS WINDOW

01:48.533 --> 01:49.533
OPEN, SO I WAS TEACHING HIM A

01:49.533 --> 01:51.067
LESSON.

01:51.067 --> 01:52.167
AND THERE WAS NO -- THERE WAS NO

01:52.167 --> 01:53.300
SCREEN ON IT, SO I PUT MOSQUITOS

01:53.300 --> 01:54.433
IN SO MAYBE HE'D GET THE IDEA TO

01:54.433 --> 01:55.400
GET A SCREEN.

01:57.267 --> 01:58.267
I PUT LIKE THOUSANDS OF

01:58.267 --> 01:59.400
MOSQUITOS IN HIS HOUSE, AND I

01:59.400 --> 02:00.533
THOUGHT HE'D GET THE HINT.

02:00.533 --> 02:01.600
I MEAN, DO YOU THINK I DESERVED

02:01.600 --> 02:02.067
THAT?

02:02.067 --> 02:03.067
>> NO.

02:03.067 --> 02:05.633
>> NO, SHE CLEARLY DOES.

02:05.633 --> 02:06.867
>> SO, JUST THE CHOCOLATE SAUCE?

02:06.867 --> 02:07.467
>> YEAH.

02:10.067 --> 02:11.300
>> HELLO. HOW ARE YOU?

02:11.300 --> 02:12.567
>> I'LL TAKE AN ALEVE.

02:12.567 --> 02:13.767
>> YOU NEED AN ALEVE?

02:13.767 --> 02:14.833
>> I NEED AN ALEVE.

02:14.833 --> 02:15.567
>> SURE.

02:15.567 --> 02:16.700
>> SEND IN THE ACTOR.

02:16.700 --> 02:18.300
WE'VE GOT THE TYLENOL, WE'VE GOT

02:18.300 --> 02:20.300
ADVIL, MOTRIN...

02:20.300 --> 02:21.367
UH, LET ME SEE WHAT ELSE WE

02:21.367 --> 02:22.067
MIGHT HAVE.

02:22.067 --> 02:23.133
AH!

02:23.167 --> 02:24.967
>> YOU SON OF A BITCH!

02:26.567 --> 02:28.067
>> OH, MY GOD!

02:28.067 --> 02:30.500
>> WHOA!

02:30.500 --> 02:32.067
>> WHAT WAS THAT?

02:32.067 --> 02:33.300
>> I eBay'd HER PROSTHETIC

02:33.300 --> 02:34.067
ANKLE.

02:35.700 --> 02:37.367
>> I eBay'd HER PROSTHETIC

02:37.367 --> 02:39.267
ANKLE.

02:41.700 --> 02:42.767
SHE'S A FRIEND OF MINE.

02:42.767 --> 02:44.100
SHE'S GOT A PROSTHETIC ANKLE,

02:44.100 --> 02:45.300
BUT SHE'S GOT A SPARE ONE.

02:45.300 --> 02:46.767
SO I PUT IT UP ON eBay, AND I

02:46.767 --> 02:48.067
TRIED TO SELL IT.

02:48.067 --> 02:49.067
I THINK THE ISSUE WAS, I JUST

02:49.067 --> 02:50.133
THOUGHT IT WAS JUST AN EXTRA

02:50.133 --> 02:51.200
PROSTHETIC ANKLE THAT SHE HAD IN

02:51.200 --> 02:51.700
A DRAWER.

02:52.867 --> 02:54.367
IT WAS HER LEFT ANKLE -- HER

02:54.367 --> 02:55.600
LEFT PROSTHETIC ANKLE.

02:55.600 --> 02:57.200
I THOUGHT SHE ONLY HAD A RIGHT

02:57.200 --> 02:58.200
PROSTHETIC ANKLE.

02:58.200 --> 02:59.400
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT SHE NEEDED

02:59.400 --> 03:00.367
THEM BOTH.

03:00.367 --> 03:01.400
>> OH, WELL.

03:01.400 --> 03:02.933
YOU DON'T HAVE ALEVE, THEN?

03:05.133 --> 03:07.333
>> BUT DID I DESERVE THAT?

03:07.333 --> 03:08.067
>> NO.

03:08.067 --> 03:09.567
SHE COULD'VE JUST TOLD YOU.

03:09.567 --> 03:13.700
>> OH!

03:13.700 --> 03:15.067
>> $100 CASH IF YOU RUN YOUR

03:15.067 --> 03:16.167
FINGERS THROUGH HIS CHEST HAIR.

03:18.900 --> 03:20.433
>> THIS IS NOT THE BIT.

03:20.433 --> 03:21.700
>> 100 BUCKS CASH?

03:21.700 --> 03:22.567
>> CASH.

03:22.567 --> 03:24.133
>> I WOULD DO THAT.

03:24.133 --> 03:25.300

03:32.467 --> 03:33.267
LOOK AT THAT.

03:33.267 --> 03:34.133

03:34.133 --> 03:35.067
>> IT GROWS OUT.

03:35.067 --> 03:35.600
>> YEAH.

03:35.600 --> 03:37.800

04:53.633 --> 04:55.367
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS A FORMAL

04:55.367 --> 04:57.067
EVENT, SO I WORE SWEATPANTS.

04:57.067 --> 04:58.867
EVERYONE ELSE WAS IN KHAKIS AND

04:58.867 --> 05:00.067

05:00.067 --> 05:01.100
HE WAS CLEARLY UPSET ABOUT IT,

05:01.100 --> 05:02.100
AND THE WHOLE NIGHT, HE WAS
