00:01.440 --> 00:05.592
These remains from the Iron Age were found
at the bottom of shaft three at the site.

00:05.680 --> 00:08.990
Five sets of remains were found.
This is the only one found whole.

00:09.080 --> 00:12.231
- He's in good shape. - 1500 years
old - he shouldn't look this good.

00:12.320 --> 00:17.348
Which is why we're here. We authenticate the
finest set of Iron Age remains ever found,

00:17.440 --> 00:21.718
or dash the hopes of a thousand
scholars. Let me know how it turns out.

00:21.800 --> 00:25.679
Dr Goodman, this is prestigious. Aren't
you going to be a part of the team?

00:25.760 --> 00:29.548
- I have an institution to run.
- Didn't you used to be an archaeologist?

00:29.640 --> 00:33.110
Yes, Mr Addy. Thanks for reminding me.

00:33.640 --> 00:37.952
X- rays, pictures - we'll do this without
touching the skeleton as much as possible.

00:38.040 --> 00:41.430
- Kid gloves?
- Latex should be all right.

00:42.560 --> 00:47.111
- Zack, were you being metaphoric?
- I decided to give it a shot.

00:47.200 --> 00:49.953
Which is also metaphoric.

00:53.320 --> 00:57.711
I need a receptionist. I can't
have just anybody waltzing in here.

00:57.800 --> 00:59.870
Take a look at this.

00:59.960 --> 01:03.919
- A bunch of red circles?
- Each circle is where a body part was found.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.434
- Is it an airport?
- Los Angeles InternationaI.

01:06.520 --> 01:10.718
- Pathologist says remains are in bad shape.
- So they punt it to the FBI?

01:10.800 --> 01:14.270
Airports fall under federaI
jurisdiction. Nice use of the word "punt".

01:14.360 --> 01:17.557
I can't go to LA. I have an
Iron Age warrior to authenticate.

01:17.640 --> 01:19.870
Iron Age warrior? When was the Iron Age?

01:19.960 --> 01:23.669
- 1500 years ago.
- Fresh body bits are a little bit more urgent.

01:23.760 --> 01:27.639
There are more fresh bodies than
perfect specimens from the Iron Age.

01:27.720 --> 01:29.950
When you say that, it's
just to bug me, right?

01:30.040 --> 01:32.838
- Do we have to go through this every time?
- Exactly.

01:32.920 --> 01:36.310
Booth can'tjust say, "Pack
your bags, we're going to LA."

01:36.400 --> 01:38.595
Yeah, the whole Ice age warrior thing.

01:38.680 --> 01:40.875
Iron Age. And that's not the only thing.

01:40.960 --> 01:44.509
Homeland Security has asked Dr
Brennan to identify three bodies in...

01:44.600 --> 01:48.070
- I'm not allowed to say.
- The point is, Dr Brennan is in great demand

01:48.160 --> 01:51.709
on severaI pressing cases and
she's needed here at the museum.

01:51.800 --> 01:56.316
- Why should I send her to California?
- Sexy case in Hollywood?

01:56.400 --> 02:00.632
How much more good press
could the Jeffersonian get?

02:03.240 --> 02:08.109
But, Dr Goodman, you said the Iron Age
warrior was of the highest priority.

02:08.199 --> 02:11.237
I can step in on that
case. You pack your bags.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:20.240 --> 02:22.310
This car doesn't feeI very FBI-y.

02:22.400 --> 02:26.871
Bones, this is a 1966 Mustang. It's a classic.
What goes better than that with the FBI?

02:26.960 --> 02:30.157
How come on the rentaI agreement,
you made the guy write sedan?

02:30.240 --> 02:32.310
Come on, we're in California!

02:32.400 --> 02:36.075
- Look. Palm trees.
- You know, I'd like to drive sometime.

02:36.160 --> 02:39.516
- Our contact is SpeciaI Agent Tricia Finn.
- I'm an excellent driver.

02:39.600 --> 02:41.670
- OK, Rain Man.
- I don't know what that means.

02:41.760 --> 02:46.675
I'm always going to drive. Me behind
the wheeI and you on the grandma side.

02:46.760 --> 02:51.629
I'm not above telling Deputy Director
Cullen what kind of car you rented.

03:02.720 --> 03:05.678
Do you want us to do something
orjust stand here and watch?

03:05.760 --> 03:08.593
- I'm getting a feeI for the fella.
- A feeI?

03:08.680 --> 03:11.319
No bugs on him. Haven't
been for over 1,000 years.

03:11.400 --> 03:14.392
- There may be spores and pollens, correct?
- Probably not.

03:14.480 --> 03:18.314
Dozens of pollens have been discovered
from the Cretaceous era. When was that?

03:18.400 --> 03:22.552
65 million years. That
was a pretty good comeback.

03:22.640 --> 03:25.154
We have to be at the top of our game.

03:25.240 --> 03:28.949
We all know you'll say, "I'm unable
to authenticate with confidence. "

03:29.040 --> 03:31.474
- Why?
- When you declare something authentic,

03:31.560 --> 03:35.030
you risk being proven wrong. That
doesn't happen if you equivocate.

03:35.120 --> 03:40.148
As head of the Jeffersonian, he'll place the
reputation of the institution over everything.

03:40.240 --> 03:44.313
I'm an archaeologist. My findings
will be congruent with the facts.

03:44.400 --> 03:48.871
With all due respect, you
used to be an archaeologist.

03:52.360 --> 03:56.353
I have no idea what's going
on between you two right now.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.993
- Agent Finn, why was the body removed?
- Call me Tricia, Dr Brennan.

04:05.080 --> 04:08.516
It was removed because parts
were visible to arriving flights.

04:08.600 --> 04:12.991
Here's a map of the crime scene. There's a
marked cone at the location of each body part

04:13.080 --> 04:16.470
and each photo corresponds to a cone.
That's how they do it in your book.

04:16.560 --> 04:19.471
- She got that from me.
- This is not a dismemberment.

04:19.560 --> 04:22.677
Are you sure, Bones? This is
Los Angeles. They're showy.

04:22.760 --> 04:27.550
Is it possible the parts were ground up
in a landing gear, then dumped on landing?

04:27.640 --> 04:32.509
The dispersaI rate is wrong. It looks to me
like the body was pulled apart by a pack of dogs.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.909
- More likely coyotes.
- Coyotes?

04:35.000 --> 04:37.195
- We got coyotes everywhere.
- You know that?

04:37.280 --> 04:42.400
- No, I thought coyotes were a cowboy thing.
- I'd like to see the remains now.

04:43.520 --> 04:48.753
<i>I need the dirt, silt, pieces collected
with the body parts sent to the Jeffersonian.</i>

04:48.840 --> 04:52.992
You know what I like? When there's no flesh
on the bones. Just a personaI preference.

04:53.080 --> 04:55.913
- There's not much left anyway.
- You know, Dr Brennan,

04:56.000 --> 05:00.551
as a screenplay writer myself, I'd be happy
to help in any way I can with your movie.

05:00.640 --> 05:04.519
- Excuse me?
- They're making your book into a movie.

05:04.600 --> 05:05.919
Say something, Bones.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.313
AII I know is I'm supposed to meet some big
movie producer while I'm here, if I have time.

05:11.400 --> 05:14.756
Does the pathologist need any
access to the remaining soft tissue?

05:14.840 --> 05:17.354
No. He got everything
out of it he could.

05:17.440 --> 05:23.390
So my screenplay is about this FBI agent
who is on the traiI of a former boyfriend...

05:23.480 --> 05:27.359
- Oh... Um... God.
- It's OK if you have to leave.

05:29.600 --> 05:31.955
- This is not good.
- Thanks for that insight.

05:32.040 --> 05:36.238
No. I mean, the architecture of the
skull has been radically altered.

05:36.320 --> 05:40.393
By rotting and being eaten by coyotes
and having the face ripped off by you?

05:40.480 --> 05:43.153
No. By surgery.

05:43.240 --> 05:45.754
Lots of surgery.

05:45.840 --> 05:49.594
I'm not sure I'll be
able to tell who this was.

06:22.240 --> 06:26.028
- Are you getting the feed, Zack?
- Yes, I'm looking at the x-rays.

06:26.120 --> 06:29.874
I'm going to have the bones cleaned,
but there's still vestiges of flesh.

06:29.960 --> 06:33.839
- Hodgins got the clothing remnants and silt.
- Are you there, Ange?

06:33.920 --> 06:35.990
Hey!

06:36.080 --> 06:38.355
Is it sunny, sweetie?
Tell me it's sunny.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.829
It's sunny. I sent you the entire skull.

06:40.920 --> 06:43.036
- You want a reconstruction?
- If you can.

06:43.120 --> 06:45.270
If I can? Have I ever failed you?

06:45.360 --> 06:48.511
This one's different.
You'll see what I mean. Zack.

06:48.600 --> 06:50.830
- I'm here.
- I make this a young woman.

06:50.920 --> 06:53.878
- Early 20s from the look of
the x-rays. - Cause of death?

06:53.960 --> 06:58.033
I see evidence of stabbing. One hit to
the sternum, two to the costaI cartilages.

06:58.120 --> 07:03.638
- Estimated time of death?
- Body was in the open for a week to ten days.

07:03.720 --> 07:07.759
The marks on the bones suggest carnivorous
feeding beyond insects and rodents.

07:07.840 --> 07:09.831
- Coyotes.
- They have coyotes?

07:09.920 --> 07:12.514
- Yes.
- That'll explain the dispersaI of remains.

07:12.600 --> 07:16.718
A pack of coyotes finds the body, pulls it
apart and spreads out to eat in solitude.

07:16.800 --> 07:19.712
- The teeth are veneered.
- The jaw has been broken and reset.

07:19.800 --> 07:22.314
Same with the right leg.
You seen any movie stars?

07:22.400 --> 07:25.551
- No. Why?
- Apparently it's a contest when you go to LA,

07:25.640 --> 07:29.076
in which the winner is the person
who sees the most celebrities.

07:29.160 --> 07:31.196
- You have a whole skull, right?
- Yes.

07:31.280 --> 07:35.558
- So why is this going to be so difficult?
- You'll see. Ange, on the Iron Age project,

07:35.640 --> 07:39.110
Goodman does this thing,
Hodgins isn't going to like it.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.873
- What thing?
- He theorises in a way.

07:41.960 --> 07:47.034
It sounds like he's making stuff up. It's hard
to explain, but it's going to irritate Hodgins.

07:47.120 --> 07:51.193
Honey. You're in California.
Forget the Iron Age.

07:51.280 --> 07:56.912
Say these words: Sky Bar. Go
there tonight. Tell me everything.

07:57.000 --> 08:01.312
Dr Brennan, one of these x-rays
shows two dark clumps near the pelvis.

08:01.400 --> 08:03.470
Behind what's left of the spleen?

08:03.560 --> 08:06.154
I got a list of missing
persons of women in their 20s.

08:06.240 --> 08:09.994
Oh, do I really have to
be here for this part?

08:10.520 --> 08:13.398
- Think she swallowed that?
- Could be she was a drug mule.

08:13.480 --> 08:17.917
- It's an implant. Breast implant.
- Those come with seriaI numbers.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.118
We should be able to identify
our victim in a couple of hours.

08:22.200 --> 08:25.988
Unlike other burials in which the remains
were found in a semi-fetaI position,

08:26.080 --> 08:32.030
this fellow was found on his back, arms at
his sides, with a piece of antler on his chest.

08:32.120 --> 08:35.908
- Do you actually need me here?
- The antler honours him as a hunter,

08:36.000 --> 08:38.275
although his weapons
tell us he was a warrior.

08:38.360 --> 08:42.876
He was in his mid-30s when he
died. He was 1.8 metres tall.

08:42.960 --> 08:47.317
- There's the Hollywood crime to sift through.
- Six foot one?

08:47.400 --> 08:52.076
A big man for his time. Feared by
his foes, respected by his neighbours.

08:52.160 --> 08:57.029
- You encourage that much conjecture?
- His bones bear the marks of battle.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.429
His weapons are of
good quality, well used.

08:59.520 --> 09:03.069
He was old for a warrior,
yet how did he die, Mr Addy?

09:03.160 --> 09:05.390
Looks like tuberculosis.

09:06.400 --> 09:10.632
A proud man. It's not the
ending he would have wanted.

09:11.680 --> 09:15.195
Yet he was surrounded
by family and friends.

09:15.280 --> 09:17.271
- A good death.
- Oh, please.

09:17.360 --> 09:19.794
<i>You're describing a scene
from Lord of the Rings.</i>

09:19.880 --> 09:22.678
- I liked that movie.
- He was buried with respect.

09:22.760 --> 09:27.675
Weapons, jewellery. His
family did not stint or pilfer.

09:27.760 --> 09:30.513
- Have you found any spores or fungi?
- Yes.

09:30.600 --> 09:36.675
They correspond both with the time he lived
and the geography in which he was found.

09:37.760 --> 09:40.433
- What?
- I'd like details.

09:40.520 --> 09:42.397
- A written report?
- Yes.

09:42.480 --> 09:47.838
Our findings will have to bear
scholarly scrutiny from our peers.

09:50.520 --> 09:52.476
What's his problem?

10:14.200 --> 10:18.318
- My hoteI doesn't even have a pooI.
- You're welcome to use mine.

10:19.040 --> 10:23.079
- The breast implant lead went nowhere.
- What about the seriaI numbers?

10:23.160 --> 10:26.994
They were stolen six months ago. Victim
must have got them off the black market.

10:27.080 --> 10:31.073
- There's a black market in breast implants?
- We have the name of the doctor.

10:31.160 --> 10:33.355
Who uses a black market breast implant?

10:33.440 --> 10:36.910
Back alley plastic surgeons use
them. They're not even reaI doctors.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.833
- Are you writing the screenplay?
- What screenplay?

10:39.920 --> 10:43.993
- The one based on your book.
- Maybe the producer I'm meeting will tell me.

10:44.080 --> 10:49.359
OK, guys, let's turn our attention back to
the murder victim. I'd like to visit Dr Boobs.

10:49.440 --> 10:52.352
If implants were stolen from
him, he won't know anything.

10:52.440 --> 10:55.512
Because it's the only
lead that we've got, Finn,

10:55.600 --> 11:01.152
and leads are great for screenplays or
even, say, if you're working a reaI case.

11:06.520 --> 11:08.829
I have something for you.

11:08.920 --> 11:11.957
<i>- Is it chocolate?
- No.</i>

11:12.040 --> 11:15.032
Then I find my interest has flagged.

11:16.680 --> 11:18.830
Nice. Who is it?

11:18.920 --> 11:21.957
It's the Hollywood murder victim.

11:22.040 --> 11:24.110
Oh, my God.

11:24.200 --> 11:27.112
I see what Brennan means. This
woman's had a lot of surgery.

11:27.200 --> 11:30.636
- What's with Goodman and Hodgins?
- They're guys.

11:30.720 --> 11:33.029
They should lay 'em out
on the table and measure.

11:33.120 --> 11:37.352
- Lay what out on the table and measure?
- OK, awkward moment.

11:37.440 --> 11:42.036
Let's just say they have different
approaches. And they're guys. OK?

11:42.120 --> 11:45.908
- I'm a guy.
- You're more highly evolved.

11:46.000 --> 11:50.710
This girI didn'tjust change her face, she
changed her skull. This'll make Brennan nuts.

11:50.800 --> 11:52.313
- You know one thing.
- What?

11:52.400 --> 11:57.349
She's gonna be beautifuI. Why go through
all this pain and not end up beautifuI?

11:57.440 --> 12:01.513
Do the names MichaeI Jackson or
Joan Rivers mean anything to you?

12:01.600 --> 12:04.114
One of them. The other I'II look up.

12:06.240 --> 12:10.028
Every culture nurtures ideals of
beauty toward which people strive. Fine.

12:10.120 --> 12:15.433
But in the future, people will look back upon
the surgicaI alterations of the nose or breasts

12:15.520 --> 12:20.514
with the same horror we regard binding of
feet or bronze coils to extend the neck.

12:20.600 --> 12:24.673
You want to speak up cos it's hard to
hear every word in this quiet waiting room?

12:24.760 --> 12:28.036
It's barbaric. It's painfuI. It's wrong.

12:28.120 --> 12:33.035
This murder victim may never be identified
cos a glorified barber with a medicaI degree

12:33.120 --> 12:36.556
had the arrogance to think he
could do better than evolution.

12:36.640 --> 12:40.474
- Know what producer you're meeting?
- My publisher didn't give me a name.

12:40.560 --> 12:44.917
- I don't know what a producer does.
- Nobody does. But it's really important.

12:45.000 --> 12:49.471
- Dr Kostov will see you now.
- You can remain here, Agent Finn.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.551
Yes, sir.

12:55.120 --> 12:59.398
- You recognise this, Dr Kostov?
- High profile, double lumen, full C saline.

12:59.480 --> 13:03.029
It's from a shipment of implants
you reported stolen six months ago.

13:03.120 --> 13:05.475
You're returning one implant to me?!

13:05.560 --> 13:09.519
- I found it in the remains of a murdered girI.
- Any implants been recovered?

13:09.600 --> 13:14.230
Yeah. Three weeks ago. A faulty one had to
be removed by a surgeon out in the Valley.

13:14.320 --> 13:16.151
- From whom?
- A Heidi.

13:16.240 --> 13:18.708
- What's that mean? -
LA-speak for call girI.

13:18.800 --> 13:21.997
LAPD can tell you what agency
the girI was working for.

13:22.080 --> 13:26.551
- You have the most beautifuI bone structure.
- I can't take credit. It's genetic.

13:26.640 --> 13:29.154
- How old are you?
- Why do you want to know?

13:29.240 --> 13:34.075
It's never too early to watch problem areas
- the jaw, the little pouches beneath the eyes.

13:34.160 --> 13:37.311
- Do you mind?
- You touch her, she'll break your arm.

13:37.400 --> 13:40.790
- She thinks what you do is...
- Barbaric.

13:43.280 --> 13:46.556
No. Don't look at me. I
like my face the way it is.

13:46.640 --> 13:52.237
<i>- I'm having a bad time with the skull.
- Did you fill in the surgicaI scoring?</i>

13:52.320 --> 13:55.835
I can't be definitive. All the
usuaI indicators have been modified.

13:55.920 --> 13:59.071
I reconstructed three faciaI variations.

13:59.160 --> 14:04.234
She had her cheek bones shaved, her
chin changed, herjaw reconstructed.

14:04.320 --> 14:07.949
That's just her bones. We don't know
what she did to the soft tissue -

14:08.040 --> 14:09.792
her nose, her brows, her cheeks.

14:09.880 --> 14:12.599
Start with her basic
architecture and go from there.

14:12.680 --> 14:15.069
<i>The basic architecture
is what I can't find.</i>

14:15.160 --> 14:18.789
- Make a best estimate.
- Did you just tell me to guess?

14:18.880 --> 14:22.589
No. I said make a best estimate based
upon your experience and expertise.

14:22.680 --> 14:27.071
OK. Well, dress it up however
you want, but it's still a guess.

14:27.160 --> 14:32.029
Look, my experience and my
expertise don't extend to this.

14:32.120 --> 14:34.475
A faciaI reconstruction
might not be helpfuI.

14:34.560 --> 14:37.836
Angela, I told you it'd be
hard. Just do what you can.

14:37.920 --> 14:42.357
OK, Bren, you're being a
little edgy and tart with me.

14:42.440 --> 14:45.238
And all I'm trying to
do is tell you the truth.

14:45.320 --> 14:50.838
What this young woman did to herself, it's
as if she completely removed her own identity.

14:50.920 --> 14:55.994
<i>Who hates herself so much that she not only
changes her looks, but her core architecture?</i>

14:56.080 --> 15:01.074
If we don't know who she is, then how
will we catch the person who murdered her?

15:01.160 --> 15:05.756
- Is that your way of apologising?
- Yes, Angela.

15:05.840 --> 15:09.515
I accept. I love your guts, sweetie.

15:16.720 --> 15:20.872
<i>According to LAPD, a black market
breast implant from the same shipment</i>

15:20.960 --> 15:24.475
<i>- was in another girI from Aphrodite Escorts.
- Missing anyone?</i>

15:24.560 --> 15:28.473
We're not looking into your business.
We're just trying to solve a murder.

15:28.560 --> 15:32.030
- I haven't heard from RacheI in two weeks.
- Is that unusuaI?

15:32.120 --> 15:36.193
I prefer to ask the questions
my own way, Agent Finn. Thanks.

15:36.280 --> 15:38.635
RacheI booked out at a one-week rate.

15:38.720 --> 15:43.714
She knows to check in if the client wants
to extend the contract. It's time to worry.

15:43.800 --> 15:46.997
Do any of these women resemble RacheI?

15:50.120 --> 15:54.193
If I had to pick one, this is
the closest, but not really.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.390
- RacheI have a last name?
- RacheI wasn't even her reaI first name.

15:58.480 --> 16:00.357
She goes by RacheI LaChance.

16:00.440 --> 16:03.557
RacheI went to Vegas
with a long-time customer.

16:03.640 --> 16:05.631
I need his name.

16:06.720 --> 16:08.756
Miss Bardu, it's always the same story.

16:08.840 --> 16:11.991
BeautifuI young woman,
somebody wants to meet her,

16:12.080 --> 16:14.833
somebody can't have her, somebody dies.

16:17.360 --> 16:22.275
Dr Anton Kostov. An assembly
line nip-tucker in town.

16:23.240 --> 16:26.676
- If that's all?
- Do you have a card, Miss Bardu?

16:32.120 --> 16:35.351
We provide a law enforcement discount.

16:37.120 --> 16:40.635
Do you have any idea what RacheI
looked like before plastic surgery?

16:40.720 --> 16:42.711
Which time?

16:47.760 --> 16:50.320
The skull is in extremely good shape.

16:50.400 --> 16:54.712
CraniaI measurements are congruent with
ancient Saxons, Celts, and pre-Aryans.

16:54.800 --> 16:59.351
- Which matches the location of the find.
- I used Saxon tissue depth for the markers.

16:59.440 --> 17:02.432
However, every skull requires
its own unique demands.

17:02.520 --> 17:04.511
Are you certain of your calculations?

17:04.599 --> 17:07.717
More certain than I am on
Brennan's Hollywood hooker case.

17:07.800 --> 17:12.794
This is a Pict. "Picti" actually
means "painted ones" in Latin.

17:12.880 --> 17:16.316
The Romans feared them. Very little
is written about them or by them.

17:16.400 --> 17:21.076
- Fierce warriors falsely reported to be small.
- He's a Pict. So what?

17:21.160 --> 17:26.439
The Picts are from the far, far north of
the British Isles, far above Hadrian's Wall.

17:26.520 --> 17:31.435
The remains were found at an archaeologicaI
site in southern England, near Wales.

17:31.520 --> 17:35.195
- A Pict can't go for a walk?
- His remains are an archaeologicaI anomaly.

17:35.280 --> 17:39.239
This is unique in that no Pict has
ever been found this far south before.

17:39.320 --> 17:42.551
If we remove the clothing and
take a closer look at the bones...

17:42.640 --> 17:46.155
- It's a face. Maybe Angela got it wrong.
- Hey!

17:46.240 --> 17:52.554
Or Zack screwed up the measurements. This
Pict business sounds like one of your stories.

17:52.640 --> 17:54.278
Enough.

18:03.080 --> 18:09.030
- Are you trying to get fired?
- Science is no country for storytellers, baby.

18:11.160 --> 18:14.357
Kostov knew RacheI as a patient
and she knew him as a client.

18:14.440 --> 18:16.874
Kostov wasn't the victim's
only plastic surgeon.

18:16.960 --> 18:20.157
These are ten-times magnifications
of the jawbone surgery.

18:20.240 --> 18:24.836
- Kostov doesn't do work this sophisticated.
- So she had more than one plastic surgeon.

18:24.920 --> 18:28.071
Zack Addy. I live to serve.

18:28.160 --> 18:31.152
This faciaI surgery, the edges
of the bone are almost scalped

18:31.240 --> 18:34.118
as if the blade simultaneously
cut and applied torsion.

18:34.200 --> 18:38.318
You need to know if this is sanctioned
by the American MedicaI Association.

18:38.400 --> 18:41.198
You think Kostov is
performing illegaI surgery?

18:41.280 --> 18:45.068
It won't help us discover her identity,
but it might help us catch her killer.

18:45.160 --> 18:47.037
- That's the point, Bones.
- What?

18:47.120 --> 18:50.157
- To catch the murderer.
- I'm sending you a catalogue.

18:50.240 --> 18:53.789
SoiI samples, pollen, particulates,
etc, that were on the body parts.

18:53.880 --> 18:56.633
Nothing too surprising
except for e-glass fibres.

18:56.720 --> 18:59.871
- She didn't pick that up in a field.
- It's marine fibreglass.

18:59.960 --> 19:05.239
The victim was on a boat before she died.
Also, look. It's a fingernaiI. Probably hers.

19:05.320 --> 19:08.153
I sent it to the FBI
crime lab to run DNA tests.

19:08.240 --> 19:12.950
That's zirconium, not a diamond, so I
guess she wasn't a high-class prostitute.

19:13.040 --> 19:16.316
All the perturbations are
consistent with recent surgeries,

19:16.400 --> 19:21.599
except for fractures in the right tibia and
fibula, which indicate traumatic compression.

19:21.680 --> 19:25.753
The victim had her leg crushed,
probably in a car accident around age 13.

19:25.840 --> 19:28.434
- That's my cellphone!
- I analysed the molars.

19:28.520 --> 19:32.433
Oxygen and strontium in the enameI
indicate early childhood in New England.

19:32.520 --> 19:35.671
The dentin suggests six to ten
years in Southern California.

19:35.760 --> 19:38.513
Miss Bardu, hi. I
reconsidered your offer.

19:38.600 --> 19:42.354
- Can I have one of your ladies?
- You're ordering a prostitute on my phone?!

19:42.440 --> 19:45.034
Did RacheI ever do
a two-on-one speciaI?

19:45.120 --> 19:48.112
- The old two-on-one speciaI.
Classic. - What's a classic?

19:48.200 --> 19:52.239
- Just send whoever she worked with most.
- You're ordering a hooker to my hoteI?

19:52.320 --> 19:55.153
- Did you say hooker?
- How come I never go on these trips?

19:55.240 --> 19:57.595
You have looser daily
allowances than I do.

19:57.680 --> 20:00.956
Well, have fun. I have
to get up early tomorrow.

20:01.040 --> 20:04.510
- Why?
- I'm meeting that producer.

20:07.880 --> 20:10.553
Oh, you're one of those guys.

20:10.640 --> 20:13.712
- What guys?
- Those guys who say they just want to talk.

20:13.800 --> 20:16.268
I do just want to talk.

20:16.360 --> 20:19.989
- I'm an FBI agent.
- OK, I get the drill.

20:20.080 --> 20:22.071
What am I playing?

20:23.000 --> 20:25.070
No, really, Leslie, I...

20:26.760 --> 20:30.594
I really am an FBI agent. I just want
to ask you some questions, that's all.

20:30.680 --> 20:34.070
- About what?
- About your friend RacheI.

20:36.640 --> 20:40.349
I'm sorry, but I think...
I think she's been murdered.

20:44.320 --> 20:46.993
This can't be happening.

20:49.640 --> 20:51.232
God.

20:51.320 --> 20:54.073
RacheI was so nice.

20:54.160 --> 20:59.632
She was really an actress. You
know, the way I'm really a singer.

20:59.720 --> 21:02.837
We all say we're something
different than what we are.

21:02.920 --> 21:05.912
None of us want to be what we are.

21:08.440 --> 21:13.719
- Do you know RacheI's reaI name?
- Candice. Candice Hayden.

21:13.800 --> 21:15.631
But I doubt that was her reaI name.

21:15.720 --> 21:19.554
She said she was from Stockton, but I said
I was from Coeur d'Alene and was Iying.

21:19.640 --> 21:21.835
Know why anyone would want Candice dead?

21:21.920 --> 21:24.388
We see things we shouldn't all the time.

21:24.480 --> 21:27.358
We know things about powerfuI
people they don't want us to.

21:27.440 --> 21:30.034
Did Candice have anyone in her life?

21:30.120 --> 21:32.759
Nick... for a while.

21:32.840 --> 21:36.833
<i>I forget his last name, but he
played some kind of terrorist on 24.</i>

21:36.920 --> 21:39.195
He got killed in, like, four seconds.

21:39.280 --> 21:42.875
- Nick know that Candice was a call girI?
- No. Not at first.

21:42.960 --> 21:45.952
And when he found
out, he was really mad.

21:46.040 --> 21:48.713
He smashed out all
the windows of her car.

21:48.800 --> 21:51.712
I'm sorry, miss, but
you're gonna have to leave.

21:51.800 --> 21:54.951
I don't know what your problem
is, but this is my little sister.

21:55.040 --> 21:59.750
I'm visiting from Coeur d'Alene. I asked her
here for a drink, which is taking a long time.

21:59.840 --> 22:04.994
- I'm sorry, sir. But we have strict rules...
- You might want to have a little respect.

22:05.080 --> 22:08.629
And check on those
drinks for us, OK, paI?

22:08.720 --> 22:10.915
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

22:12.040 --> 22:13.871
Thank you.

22:14.680 --> 22:19.196
So we're just gonna sit
here and have a drink?

22:19.280 --> 22:21.953
- That's all?
- That's all, Leslie.

22:22.040 --> 22:26.272
Have a drink. Enjoy the
view. Pretend we belong.

22:27.080 --> 22:29.469
And later, catch a murderer.

22:35.160 --> 22:38.835
Agent Booth, can I
have a moment, please?

22:39.280 --> 22:41.635
Um, have I done something to offend you?

22:41.720 --> 22:45.554
I'm not really into this West Coast
"in touch with your feelings" thing.

22:45.640 --> 22:48.837
Yeah. I'm really good at my job.

22:48.920 --> 22:53.596
And I've been nothing but cooperative and
helpfuI to you, but you just freeze me out.

22:53.680 --> 22:54.908
Mm-hm.

22:55.880 --> 23:00.510
I know you've nothing against working with
women cos you're partners with Dr Brennan.

23:00.600 --> 23:02.716
So your problem must be with me.

23:02.800 --> 23:07.157
Look, I don't have anything against you.
I just don't like the way you view the FBI.

23:07.240 --> 23:09.834
- What do you mean?
- This is a proud and noble job,

23:09.920 --> 23:12.070
but you're using it to
get to something else.

23:12.160 --> 23:17.314
My advice: write your script, get an
agent. Hell, have a little plastic surgery.

23:17.400 --> 23:22.474
But quit using my FBI as a stepping stone
into something that you think is better,

23:22.560 --> 23:25.393
because in my book
there is nothing better.

23:27.560 --> 23:31.838
I'm here with Penny Marshall, one of the
most prolific "hyphenates" in Hollywood.

23:31.920 --> 23:36.630
<i>Actress, producer, and director of such
hits as A League of Their Own and Big.</i>

23:36.720 --> 23:39.314
<i>Her latest project is Bred in the Bone,</i>

23:39.400 --> 23:46.112
a thriller based on the noveI by crime-fighting
anthropologist Dr Temperance Brennan.

23:46.200 --> 23:50.398
- OK, so how did this all come together?
- I have no idea.

23:50.480 --> 23:54.632
Well, my brother Gary gave
me the book and I liked it.

23:54.720 --> 23:58.998
Then this bidding war started. And I usually
don't get into that kind of thing, but...

23:59.080 --> 24:04.074
- That's gotta be a thrill for a first-time
author. - I wasn't actually there.

24:04.160 --> 24:07.709
You must be a big fan of Penny's
films. So which one's your favourite?

24:07.800 --> 24:12.271
Well, I enjoyed her humorous
treatment of the time-space paradox.

24:15.920 --> 24:18.229
<i>Big!</i>

24:18.320 --> 24:21.630
That's very funny. Time-space paradox.

24:21.720 --> 24:23.950
Penny, who is gonna write the script?

24:24.040 --> 24:26.315
Don't I get to do that?

24:27.520 --> 24:30.239
<i>We'll talk.</i>

24:30.320 --> 24:32.993
Cut, stop, whatever you say.

24:33.080 --> 24:36.436
Brennan. Well, I want to come with you.

24:36.520 --> 24:39.751
I have to go cos we have
a suspect and I have to go.

24:39.840 --> 24:42.877
Would you look at that... passion!

24:55.720 --> 24:59.315
Pretty good chance one of these
leaping losers is our killer.

24:59.400 --> 25:02.278
- You always think it's the boyfriend.
- He loved her.

25:02.360 --> 25:04.590
He found out that she was a prostitute.

25:04.680 --> 25:10.277
I'd say anyone who plays this
stupid game is capable of murder.

25:10.360 --> 25:14.990
Well, then we've got this case sewed up.
Why don't you just go and arrest them all?

25:15.080 --> 25:17.310
Excuse me, guys. Ladies.

25:18.040 --> 25:21.316
Ladies, gentlemen, excuse me. Please.

25:26.440 --> 25:31.719
- You're excused.
- Anyone who isn't Nick Harvison get the ball.

25:34.880 --> 25:36.871
God, she was so sweet.

25:38.160 --> 25:40.958
I thought about getting
back with her, even though...

25:41.040 --> 25:42.871
You broke all the windows in her car?

25:42.960 --> 25:46.475
What would you do if you found out
your girlfriend was a prostitute?

25:46.560 --> 25:49.836
- When did you last see RacheI?
- Sandra.

25:49.920 --> 25:52.957
Her name was Sandra Cane,
at least as far as I knew.

25:53.040 --> 25:58.034
- When did you last see Sandra?
- About a month ago. I was tending bar.

25:58.120 --> 26:01.908
- Did you speak to her?
- No. No, I was working.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.436
So was she. But I didn't kill her.

26:05.520 --> 26:09.069
How could you not know what she was
doing for money? Did you know her at all?

26:09.160 --> 26:13.153
She said she was modelling.
The thing about Sandra is that,

26:13.240 --> 26:16.869
as pretty as she was, she
was just never pretty enough.

26:16.960 --> 26:21.590
She'd be all black and blue and then she
would heaI and she would look beautifuI.

26:21.680 --> 26:25.559
I mean, really beautifuI. And we'd be
sure something was gonna break for her.

26:25.640 --> 26:27.995
Then, of course, it wouldn't.

26:28.440 --> 26:32.035
And then she would be back
in front of that mirror.

26:32.120 --> 26:34.315
And no matter what I said...

26:36.440 --> 26:39.273
Look, I never knew her.
I never understood her.

26:39.360 --> 26:42.989
I'm probably the last guy you
should be asking about her.

26:43.920 --> 26:48.357
- He's an actor. Of course he's convincing.
- I don't know. He doesn't seem to work much.

26:48.440 --> 26:53.514
He's playing volleyball in the middle
of the day. Just an observation.

26:54.080 --> 26:58.392
- I have an announcement.
- You are unable to authenticate the skeleton?

26:58.480 --> 27:01.517
- That is correct.
- Told you.

27:01.600 --> 27:05.354
Given the inconsistencies between
the specimen's geographic location,

27:05.440 --> 27:08.477
physiognomy and artefacts, I
cannot authenticate the find.

27:08.560 --> 27:10.551
Is this because of how I made him look?

27:10.640 --> 27:14.155
Cos there's an amount of subjectivity
involved in recreating a face.

27:14.240 --> 27:18.552
A certain amount, yes. But the fact
is, he displays Pictish features.

27:18.640 --> 27:21.677
For all we know, this skull
doesn't belong to this body.

27:21.760 --> 27:25.309
Even though it looks like the head
is attached to the spinaI cord.

27:25.400 --> 27:28.039
We could go in and look.
Confirm the authenticity.

27:28.120 --> 27:32.477
I decline to continue the investigation.
We'll restore the remains in the interim.

27:32.560 --> 27:34.710
I knew this was gonna happen!

27:34.800 --> 27:36.791
<i>Hodgins!</i>

27:37.880 --> 27:42.795
Because we have been colleagues on
this, more than superior and subordinate,

27:42.880 --> 27:44.950
I have allowed you to be insubordinate.

27:45.040 --> 27:50.558
But I warn you, Dr
Hodgins, that is over.

27:50.640 --> 27:55.111
- Do you want my letter of resignation?
- You know what would be better?

27:55.200 --> 27:58.476
Put them on the table
and measure. Right?

27:58.560 --> 28:01.199
OK, look. Everybody
just turn and walk away.

28:01.280 --> 28:04.590
If you want me to resign, just say so.

28:05.680 --> 28:08.069
Miss Montenegro is right.

28:10.600 --> 28:13.433
You think you just won something.

28:13.520 --> 28:17.195
I'm telling you, Goodman
was the bigger man.

28:21.240 --> 28:24.118
Isn't it against your ethicaI
code to have sex with a patient?

28:24.200 --> 28:27.636
- Do you even have an ethicaI code?
- Sex with patients is frowned upon.

28:27.720 --> 28:31.713
That's why he said the implants were
stolen. No way to prove he installed them.

28:31.800 --> 28:34.155
I did not know RacheI
was dead when you visited.

28:34.240 --> 28:37.312
And I did not kill RacheI.
I made her beautifuI.

28:37.400 --> 28:40.517
You mean, you took what was
unique about her and destroyed it.

28:40.600 --> 28:43.478
- You have a serious neurosis on this.
- Do you have a boat?

28:43.560 --> 28:46.438
Four boob jobs a day, 20 grand
a pop, of course I have a boat.

28:46.520 --> 28:48.511
That's all you get without a lawyer.

28:48.600 --> 28:52.479
And what do you do, huh?
Pay him in hair plugs?

28:52.560 --> 28:57.236
- Still working on the murder weapon?
- It's not a knife. It may be a screwdriver.

28:57.320 --> 29:01.518
- Why are you being mean to Dr Goodman?
- I'm not mean. I'm criticaI of his process.

29:01.600 --> 29:05.036
- Why are you being so criticaI?
- He should be looking at the facts.

29:05.120 --> 29:10.114
Is the skeleton authentic or not? That's all.
Instead it's all a mishmash of conjecture.

29:10.200 --> 29:16.116
I think he's forgotten how to do the science
and won't admit it. Why a screwdriver?

29:16.200 --> 29:19.988
There's more torsion than a flat-bladed
knife could bear without snapping.

29:20.080 --> 29:22.150
It twists without breaking.

29:22.240 --> 29:25.550
The killer would have to be strong,
even then the blade would snap.

29:25.640 --> 29:28.598
- Brennan said that about the jaw surgery.
- What?

29:28.680 --> 29:34.596
I don't know. I do bugs and silt, but she
said the words "torsion" and "twist" and "cut".

29:39.960 --> 29:43.475
This is the type of situation
where people say, "Oh, my God. "

29:43.560 --> 29:45.710
Pretend you're a person and say it.

29:45.800 --> 29:47.950
Oh, my God.

29:48.040 --> 29:53.068
Scenario one: prostitute gets breast
augmentation for sex, threatens to tell on him.

29:53.160 --> 29:55.674
- Plausible.
- Scenario two: jealous boyfriend.

29:55.760 --> 29:58.593
- You know the rest. Which do you like?
- Neither.

29:58.680 --> 30:02.229
- Cos there's no evidence.
- Unless you counted volleyball.

30:02.320 --> 30:05.790
- Sounds like you're getting ready to quit.
- Quit? No.

30:05.880 --> 30:08.599
The Deputy Director wants
me to hand the case over.

30:08.680 --> 30:11.558
We're supposed to give Agent
Finn what we got and go home.

30:11.640 --> 30:14.598
You don't even like Finn.
You think she's an idiot.

30:14.680 --> 30:17.752
The whole case is a bust. It's
a blank. We don't have anything.

30:17.840 --> 30:22.152
We checked her apartment. No pictures.
We don't know what she looks like.

30:22.240 --> 30:26.279
It's like she lived on
the world instead of in it.

30:26.360 --> 30:29.272
Cullen is calling you back cos
he thinks I'm at a dead end.

30:29.360 --> 30:31.954
You have to tell him he's wrong.

30:40.760 --> 30:43.035
Is he wrong?

30:43.120 --> 30:47.750
We're looking for someone who grew up in
New England, moved here eight years ago,

30:47.840 --> 30:50.229
her leg was crushed in an
accident when she was 13,

30:50.320 --> 30:53.039
she was on a boat shortly
before she was murdered,

30:53.120 --> 30:56.078
we know some of her names
and some of her faces.

30:56.160 --> 31:00.836
That's all your stuff. Usually by
now we know more about my stuff.

31:00.920 --> 31:04.230
- We have separate stuff?
- By now I usually have a feeI for the person.

31:04.320 --> 31:09.792
What they wanted, how they felt, what was going
on in their lives. With this girI, nothing.

31:09.880 --> 31:15.193
She thought she was ugly. She did everything
she could to make herself beautifuI.

31:15.280 --> 31:17.748
And all she did was make
herself more invisible.

31:17.840 --> 31:22.231
Everybody in this city thinks
they're ugly. And nobody is.

31:22.320 --> 31:24.675
I'm starting to get why
you hate anonymous death.

31:24.760 --> 31:31.074
We are born unique. Our experiences
mould and change us. We become someone.

31:31.160 --> 31:35.119
To have that taken away by murder, erased
from existence against our will is...

31:35.200 --> 31:36.713
- EviI?
- Unacceptable.

31:36.800 --> 31:41.954
These bones you bring me, I give them
a face. I say their names out loud.

31:42.040 --> 31:44.998
I return them to their loved
ones and you arrest the bad guy.

31:45.080 --> 31:47.514
- I like that.
- So do I.

31:47.600 --> 31:50.956
I feeI like we should be
arresting these doctors,

31:51.040 --> 31:55.397
because whether they killed her
or not, they still erased her.

31:56.840 --> 32:02.119
- Well, maybe I can hold Cullen off for a day.
- It's not good enough.

32:02.200 --> 32:05.556
<i>You're welcome.</i>

32:05.640 --> 32:06.550
Brennan.

32:06.640 --> 32:10.474
The murder weapon is a larger version
of the surgicaI implement used on herjaw.

32:10.560 --> 32:14.758
You compared the wounds to the marks
left on herjaw? That's brilliant, Zack.

32:14.840 --> 32:17.957
It was Hodgins. Hodgins quoting
you, so it was us. Go, team.

32:18.040 --> 32:21.669
But get this. According to the
NationaI Plastic Surgery Association,

32:21.760 --> 32:24.069
only one surgeon does this procedure.

32:24.160 --> 32:27.038
- Tell me he's in LA.
- He's in LA.

32:27.120 --> 32:31.159
Dr Henry Atlas, Rodeo
Drive, Beverly Hills. Go.

32:36.840 --> 32:41.789
I'm ethically bound to ask you for a
warrant before revealing any of my patients.

32:41.880 --> 32:46.670
Let me try this then. The jaw procedure
which Dr Brennan described to you as...

32:46.760 --> 32:48.876
Was my innovation, yes.

32:48.960 --> 32:51.235
There's an adage in my business.

32:51.320 --> 32:53.311
You can't alter the bone.

32:53.400 --> 32:56.358
I've proven it incorrect,
given the right patients.

32:56.440 --> 32:59.113
- How many have you done?
- Perhaps half a dozen.

32:59.200 --> 33:02.272
If you get a warrant, I will
release the names of my patients.

33:02.360 --> 33:06.831
- Do you use speciaI operating instruments?
- Yes. I designed them myself specifically.

33:06.920 --> 33:10.117
- Have you patented them or shared designs?
- Not yet.

33:10.200 --> 33:13.033
He's waiting to have enough
success stories to cash in.

33:13.120 --> 33:16.510
- He's gonna be short one success story.
- Let's see what we got here.

33:16.600 --> 33:21.594
Oh, Sandra Cane, RacheI LaChance, Candice
Hayden. Any of these women ring a bell?

33:21.680 --> 33:23.557
As I have reiterated...

33:23.640 --> 33:29.192
I have a search warrant here to
collect your surgicaI instruments.

33:31.120 --> 33:35.079
You'II... you'll shut me down.
You will cost me a fortune.

33:35.160 --> 33:41.030
The only ones we require, Dr Atlas,
are the ones you designed yourself.

33:42.040 --> 33:45.316
She told me her name was Susan Shepherd.

34:02.560 --> 34:04.232
Brilliant.

34:10.480 --> 34:12.994
You wanted to see me?

34:16.480 --> 34:20.996
You are a very difficult
and stubborn man, Dr Hodgins.

34:21.080 --> 34:24.389
Right now, I'd like nothing
more than to fire you.

34:25.960 --> 34:32.069
In my position, very few people
tell me the truth any more.

34:32.159 --> 34:35.708
I find I enjoy it in some perverse way.

34:35.800 --> 34:39.588
- You admit you bailed on the authentication?
- Yes.

34:39.679 --> 34:42.638
- Seriously?
- But not for the reasons you think.

34:42.719 --> 34:47.350
True, we might be able to authenticate the
skeleton by taking him apart, destroying him.

34:47.440 --> 34:50.079
If he's a fake, fine. Nothing lost.

34:50.159 --> 34:53.118
But I think he's the reaI thing.

34:53.199 --> 34:56.431
You do know he's been
dead for 1500 years, right?

34:56.520 --> 35:00.638
I am an archaeologist.
This is what we do.

35:00.720 --> 35:06.352
We step outside the facts and tell ourselves
the story of an individuaI or a culture.

35:06.440 --> 35:11.355
And if the story I tell myself about
this man who lived 1500 years ago is true,

35:11.440 --> 35:16.833
if he was laid to rest by
people who respect and loved him,

35:16.920 --> 35:21.789
don't I owe it to them not to let the
pure scientist desecrate his remains?

35:23.640 --> 35:30.159
Or you could be rationaI and say you were
waiting for imaging technology to improve

35:30.240 --> 35:34.279
to the point where it wasn't
necessary to disassemble him.

35:36.480 --> 35:38.072
Ah.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.718
Yes.

35:40.800 --> 35:45.954
- I suppose I could say that. It's less...
- SentimentaI for the pure scientists.

36:24.160 --> 36:26.435
I've got the murder weapon.

36:28.160 --> 36:31.516
We have the murder weapon. We
have trace evidence from your boat.

36:31.600 --> 36:36.594
We have testimony from your staff that you
argued with Susan Shepherd before she died.

36:36.680 --> 36:38.989
So what you need now is a confession.

36:39.080 --> 36:42.914
Your patient list is what's
known as an A-list, right?

36:43.000 --> 36:48.677
Oscar winners, supermodels,
super agents, moguls.

36:48.760 --> 36:51.228
So how is it that a call
girI makes the grade?

36:51.320 --> 36:54.676
- You can answer that, Henry.
- I did Susan's procedure pro bono.

36:54.760 --> 36:57.593
- Why?
- Because she volunteered.

36:57.680 --> 37:01.798
- She was a guinea pig.
- How did you meet her?

37:01.880 --> 37:06.476
Oh, come on. Susan just didn't
walk into your office, did she?

37:09.240 --> 37:11.959
Oh, just tell them, Henry.

37:12.040 --> 37:14.474
Through another call
girI, one I used regularly.

37:14.560 --> 37:17.757
Sometimes these girls from
the high-class establishments

37:17.840 --> 37:21.037
start to have expectations
beyond the professionaI.

37:21.120 --> 37:23.509
She thought you were gonna marry her?

37:23.600 --> 37:25.830
Something along those lines, yes.

37:25.920 --> 37:28.275
So I made a change. I
started requesting Susan.

37:28.360 --> 37:32.672
- Did you trade plastic surgery for sex?
- Obfuscate, Henry.

37:32.760 --> 37:35.513
We did each other favours.
Went fine for a few months.

37:35.600 --> 37:37.830
UntiI Susan wanted you to marry her too?

37:37.920 --> 37:40.957
No. In my opinion, Susan became
addicted to plastic surgery.

37:41.040 --> 37:45.113
I refused to do any more procedures.
That's what my staff heard us arguing about.

37:45.200 --> 37:48.158
What was Susan like?

37:48.240 --> 37:50.754
She was a girI next door.

37:50.840 --> 37:52.831
Simple, healthy.

37:53.920 --> 37:57.390
The girI before Susan was the
opposite. She was very flashy.

37:57.480 --> 38:00.119
She had diamonds in her
incisors and fingernails.

38:00.200 --> 38:04.113
- Bones, didn't Hodgins find a fingernaiI?
- Yes. With a fake diamond in it.

38:04.200 --> 38:07.875
- Susan was the girI-next-door
type? - It wasn't her fingernaiI.

38:07.960 --> 38:12.875
Jealousy, like I said. So what was
the name of the escort before Susan?

38:12.960 --> 38:16.077
The flashy one, the one who
thought you were gonna marry her?

38:16.160 --> 38:19.550
Tell the man what he
needs to know, Henry.

40:06.600 --> 40:09.160
She thought Atlas was gonna
take her out of the life.

40:09.240 --> 40:12.596
He wanted the girI next
door. You were right.

40:12.680 --> 40:14.671
Jealousy.

40:15.600 --> 40:21.232
Ah, it's an old story. I bet your 1500
year old friend back home heard a version.

40:21.320 --> 40:25.313
Leslie thought RacheI was stealing
her man, so she killed her.

40:25.400 --> 40:27.436
- What did she ask you?
- What?

40:27.520 --> 40:30.353
She asked you something
after she was arrested. What?

40:30.440 --> 40:33.113
She asked me...

40:33.200 --> 40:35.998
if I thought she was beautifuI.

40:36.080 --> 40:41.712
One more thing. The bureau searched for girls
injured in car crashes in the upper Northeast

40:41.800 --> 40:43.870
ten to twelve years ago.

40:46.040 --> 40:51.433
- Daughter's right leg was crushed.
- Allison. Her name was Allison Holmes.

40:51.520 --> 40:55.149
Her father and her brother are still
alive. Somewhere in Bangor, Maine.

40:55.240 --> 40:58.198
- We'll return the remains.
- Thanks, Booth.

40:58.280 --> 41:02.114
Well, Bones, you do your thing

41:02.200 --> 41:04.191
and I do mine.

41:05.520 --> 41:07.511
- Look at her.
- Yeah.

41:08.680 --> 41:10.671
Pretty little thing.

41:57.800 --> 42:02.555
