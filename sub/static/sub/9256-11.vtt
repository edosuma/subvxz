00:02.120 --> 00:03.360
Previously on The Shield:

00:03.560 --> 00:06.480
- I'm not gay.
- Julien, come on.

00:06.680 --> 00:08.320
I hate this thing inside of me.

00:08.520 --> 00:10.720
You can't go through life
hating who you are.

00:10.880 --> 00:11.920
I pushed away everyone.

00:12.080 --> 00:14.520
What about your alleged rape
of a 21 -year-old girl?

00:14.680 --> 00:17.400
- There's not a story here.
- I'll take that as a no comment.

00:17.560 --> 00:19.680
Thanks for coming
to my album-release party.

00:19.880 --> 00:22.720
Hey, yo, yo! Hey, Kern!
Do that duet with Tyesha.

00:23.080 --> 00:24.600
Rondell in the house.

00:24.840 --> 00:27.560
Me and Kern, we've been hanging
since we was kids.

00:27.760 --> 00:30.640
Don't you mean Kern financed
your entry into the drug business?

00:31.160 --> 00:32.360
Yeah, no comment.

00:32.560 --> 00:35.000
- I'm gonna get my money, bitch.
- Over my dead body...

00:35.160 --> 00:37.920
- Damn, that sound like a good idea.
- Shut up!

00:38.120 --> 00:39.560
This war ends here.

00:39.720 --> 00:41.760
I'm never for sale.
You two can't make peace...

00:41.920 --> 00:43.520
...I'll see one of you
in the morning.

00:50.440 --> 00:52.120
T-Bonz!

00:52.320 --> 00:55.120
Nobody else coming out of there.
Told you he was a bitch.

00:56.960 --> 01:01.160
I'm your landlord, Rondell.
I let you use space that I own.

01:01.320 --> 01:04.239
You can't follow by my rules,
then I'll find someone who can.

01:08.200 --> 01:12.240
- How can I come up with the money?
- It's easy, Rondell. Sell drugs.

01:12.440 --> 01:15.200
- Stop snorting your profit.
- Oh, man, don't be like that.

01:15.360 --> 01:17.480
Hey, you gotta hook me up, Kern.

01:17.680 --> 01:21.520
Man, you got Paula so high trying
to get laid, she couldn't even sing.

01:21.880 --> 01:24.840
I'll make it back up to you, Kern.
I always do.

01:25.040 --> 01:29.120
Listen, don't make me beg, brother.
Just hook me up with the 50 grand.

01:29.320 --> 01:31.680
Since when am I a goddamn ATM?

01:38.560 --> 01:40.480
Oh, shit!

01:40.680 --> 01:42.120
Shit! Rondell, you all right?

01:43.280 --> 01:45.520
- Where's this 50 grand?
- Rondell should be here.

01:45.720 --> 01:47.920
We don't ever touch the cash
or the shipments.

01:48.080 --> 01:50.440
- I'm not waiting around here all day.
- He'll be here.

01:50.640 --> 01:52.400
- Thought you knew how to do this.
- We do.

01:52.560 --> 01:54.560
Then what's with the goddamn
amateur hour?

01:54.760 --> 01:57.120
Know how many people want
a crate through customs?

01:57.320 --> 02:00.440
Let's set a new meet for tomorrow.
I'll drag Rondell here myself.

02:00.600 --> 02:02.560
- We'll get this all squared away.
- Tomorrow?

02:02.760 --> 02:05.520
I won't sit on that package.
It goes to the highest bidder.

02:05.720 --> 02:08.680
If something comes into this
neighbourhood, it goes through me.

02:08.840 --> 02:11.680
Guys come up with 50 grand,
you call me.

02:14.320 --> 02:16.880
Oh, I'm gonna kill Rondell.

02:17.080 --> 02:20.320
See, this is why I didn't show.
Bastards tried to kill me!

02:20.520 --> 02:23.040
- Wait till I find who shot my ride.
- Good you got armour.

02:23.240 --> 02:26.000
- Who else did you call?
- Just you. I had some product on me.

02:26.160 --> 02:28.480
What about the 50 grand
to give to Jasper?

02:28.680 --> 02:31.880
- I'm a little short on the 50 G's.
- Short? You don't have the money?

02:32.040 --> 02:34.040
These guys were breaking
in my business!

02:34.200 --> 02:36.640
- Who?
- Them bean-selling, bow tie-wearing...

02:36.800 --> 02:39.440
...skinny-suited, Nation
of Islam terrorists.

02:39.600 --> 02:41.880
- Same guys who shot at me!
- What?

02:42.080 --> 02:44.680
Yeah, they been rousting my
dealers, scaring away traffic.

02:44.840 --> 02:46.840
So yesterday, when
three of them rolled up...

02:47.040 --> 02:50.000
...start preaching and babbling all
sorts of biblical nonsense...

02:50.160 --> 02:52.000
...I swung on the main cat!

02:52.200 --> 02:54.840
- He didn't even see it coming.
- So the Muslims shoot at you?

02:55.040 --> 02:56.480
I figure they come for payback.

02:56.680 --> 02:58.960
Why you been hanging around
me all day, then?

02:59.120 --> 03:02.560
I didn't think they was gonna touch
you. And I don't got no armoured car.

03:02.760 --> 03:04.360
- What?!
- Stay here till I get back.

03:04.480 --> 03:06.680
I'm gonna go talk to them.
Which way to Mecca?

03:07.880 --> 03:09.160
That's the one.

03:09.360 --> 03:11.920
Police. Are you all right in there?

03:15.280 --> 03:18.280
Entering the premises.
Step away from the door.

03:25.400 --> 03:29.040
One Tango 13, requesting an R.A.
And additional units.

03:29.200 --> 03:31.640
We have a possible homicide
and assault.

03:31.840 --> 03:34.920
<i>Roger that, One Tango 13.
R.A. And backup.</i>

03:38.800 --> 03:40.640
She's gone.

03:47.120 --> 03:48.760
Clear.

03:50.560 --> 03:53.200
They nailed his feet to the floor.

03:54.760 --> 03:56.480
What do you want me to do?

03:58.920 --> 04:00.560
Pull the nail out of the floor...

04:00.760 --> 04:03.760
...without pulling it through his foot.
I'll get some towels.

04:05.000 --> 04:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:17.680 --> 04:19.560
Prop his feet up.

04:30.200 --> 04:33.040
Gun!

04:33.640 --> 04:35.360
Julien!

04:39.680 --> 04:42.120
- Oh, God.
- Oh, Jesus.

04:42.440 --> 04:44.520
Are you okay?

04:55.960 --> 04:56.080
- Yeah, sister, read it.
- No, no, no.

04:56.080 --> 04:57.920
- Yeah, sister, read it.
- No, no, no.

04:58.200 --> 05:00.960
- Excuse me, brother.
- How about you, brother?

05:02.120 --> 05:03.320
Yeah, yeah. Right here.

05:03.480 --> 05:06.760
- How about you, sister?
- Come on, sister.

05:06.920 --> 05:10.800
As-salaam alaikum, my brother. May I
interest you in one of our magazines?

05:11.680 --> 05:13.720
You wandered into the wrong
prayer group, frosty.

05:13.880 --> 05:16.320
We're looking for Xavier Salaam.

05:16.480 --> 05:19.720
- Xavier Salaam.
- I'm Xavier Salaam.

05:19.880 --> 05:24.240
Formerly Xavier Chris. Spent six
years in Chino for manslaughter?

05:24.400 --> 05:26.480
- That's right.
- I'm Detective Vic Mackey.

05:26.640 --> 05:31.120
- We'd like a few words with you.
- I'm happy to cooperate.

05:32.920 --> 05:36.080
I hear you had a little run-in with
Rondell Robinson the other day.

05:36.240 --> 05:38.520
You wanna tell me about that?

05:38.680 --> 05:41.480
I was trying to distribute my magazines
on the same corner...

05:41.640 --> 05:44.960
...that Mr. Robinson's men were
attempting to distribute his drugs.

05:45.160 --> 05:46.760
We fought briefly, it concluded.

05:46.920 --> 05:49.680
- You two kissed and made up?
- There will be no retaliation.

05:49.840 --> 05:53.040
I thought you guys were an eye
for an eye, whacking off hands.

05:53.200 --> 05:55.600
Those are the Jews
and fundamentalist Muslims.

05:55.760 --> 05:58.200
Nation of Islam is
an African-American way of life.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.720
So you didn't shoot up Kern Little's
car, trying to get to Rondell?

06:01.920 --> 06:03.960
The Nation does not murder.

06:04.760 --> 06:07.000
You committed murder.

06:07.360 --> 06:11.840
That was a long time ago.
And it was manslaughter.

06:12.920 --> 06:16.760
- Why this neighbourhood?
- Because it needs cleansing.

06:16.920 --> 06:18.680
What if I said that's my job?

06:19.720 --> 06:22.600
I'd say you were doing it poorly.

06:22.760 --> 06:26.840
- You can do better?
- Yes.

06:31.120 --> 06:34.680
- You okay?
- Yeah, I guess.

06:35.200 --> 06:37.160
Get some rest, son.

06:37.320 --> 06:39.440
Don't bother with that one.

06:39.600 --> 06:40.800
Thanks.

06:40.960 --> 06:43.200
You want someone
to take you home?

06:43.360 --> 06:47.200
- No. I'm okay.
- Okay.

06:52.080 --> 06:54.880
Murder, torture, suicide.
Where to start?

06:55.040 --> 06:58.920
Home invasion. Looks like
they were after the life savings.

06:59.480 --> 07:02.120
Family bank.
Brought their distrust of institutions...

07:02.280 --> 07:03.840
...with them from North Korea.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.080
- Forced entry?
- No, that was us.

07:06.320 --> 07:09.200
Neighbours said they heard
a conversation for five, 10 minutes...

07:09.360 --> 07:11.280
...then arguing, then loud music.

07:11.440 --> 07:14.400
- They recognise any of the voices?
- No, said they sounded young.

07:14.840 --> 07:17.120
What a mess.

07:22.160 --> 07:25.200
We just spoke to Xavier.
I don't get the feeling he's behind this.

07:25.480 --> 07:28.240
- I'm telling you, they did it.
- If not them, then who?

07:28.440 --> 07:30.760
Who else wants you out of the way?

07:30.960 --> 07:34.080
All kinds of rival dealers are
popping up, taking away my business.

07:34.200 --> 07:37.680
I've had shipments stolen. And now
these Muslims messing things up.

07:37.880 --> 07:39.240
What am I paying you for?

07:39.440 --> 07:41.640
Another dealer comes in,
I'm happy to clean up.

07:41.800 --> 07:44.600
But there's no way I'm strong-arming
a law-abiding citizen.

07:44.800 --> 07:47.920
- Find a way to work around it.
- So do something about these dealers.

07:48.120 --> 07:51.120
I will. I'd be trying to come
up with the 50 grand...

07:51.280 --> 07:53.360
...and hoping Jasper agrees
to another meeting.

07:53.520 --> 07:55.760
I can't come up with the cash
till I got the drugs.

07:56.080 --> 07:59.200
Well, he's not coming up with
the drugs until he's got the cash...

07:59.360 --> 08:02.560
...which screws both of us.
So think of something!

08:04.600 --> 08:06.240
Let's sweep up some
of these dealers.

08:06.400 --> 08:08.600
Twist their arms till they tell you
who's running them.

08:08.800 --> 08:10.160
Be a pleasure.

08:16.600 --> 08:18.960
Right there, right here.
He's going, he's going.

08:19.160 --> 08:20.440
Come here!

08:22.520 --> 08:25.040
Where you going? Come here.

08:27.080 --> 08:29.040
Hold on, right there.
Where you going?

08:37.200 --> 08:39.400
Where you going, huh?

08:39.600 --> 08:41.679
- You're Rondell's friend.
- His right-hand man.

08:41.840 --> 08:42.840
I am.

08:43.039 --> 08:45.520
One of your dealers broke him
and took away his Pop-Tarts.

08:45.680 --> 08:49.440
Selling Rondell's dope while he's
out chasing a bunch of bow ties.

08:49.600 --> 08:52.800
- That's a pretty ballsy move.
- You give me too much credit.

08:52.960 --> 08:56.360
I guess we should just apologise,
let you go, then, huh?

08:56.520 --> 08:58.600
- No. We gotta settle this.
- Settle what?

08:58.800 --> 09:01.400
You say you didn't shoot
up Kern's car. We think you did.

09:01.560 --> 09:05.080
- That's what we're gonna tell Kern.
- Not a good enemy to have.

09:06.640 --> 09:08.960
Things gotta change.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.680
The Nation is bad for business
and Rondell wasn't hearing it.

09:13.840 --> 09:16.920
So you figured he'd hear about
50 slugs in the side of Kern's car?

09:17.120 --> 09:20.080
I just know it's gonna take a smarter
man than what we got now.

09:20.280 --> 09:23.240
And you're dumb enough
to think that smarter man is you?

09:23.400 --> 09:26.520
Things are about to get crazy
and dangerous out there.

09:27.560 --> 09:32.360
Well, lucky for you, you'll be sitting
safe and snug in a cage in here.

09:34.120 --> 09:38.120
- You're expecting some kind of reward?
- We solved 23 murders with one bust.

09:38.280 --> 09:41.920
What do we get? No bonus, no time off,
no commendation. What is that?

09:42.080 --> 09:46.080
You broke one serial killer case.
Get off your high horse.

09:53.200 --> 09:55.960
You think they noticed us?

09:56.640 --> 09:59.920
Police. We're looking for Rhee-Soo.

10:00.080 --> 10:02.600
- Rhee-Soo?
- Are you Rhee-Soo?

10:03.680 --> 10:05.920
Is there a place where
we could talk?

10:06.400 --> 10:09.560
It's about your father,
Young-Ho.

10:10.360 --> 10:11.760
Young-Ho?

10:13.680 --> 10:17.720
- Can anyone help us?
- Does anyone here speak English?

10:18.400 --> 10:20.360
You'd better come with us.

10:22.560 --> 10:25.400
No one here speaks English?

10:27.200 --> 10:30.560
- I know it was rough.
- Yeah.

10:31.560 --> 10:34.520
Don't spend too much time asking why.

10:39.840 --> 10:43.800
Vic says if it was Dragon 10 or Flaming
Fists they would've tagged the walls.

10:43.960 --> 10:46.720
So our killers are merely working
freelance? What a relief.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.280
No telling how much they got.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.880
Our victims had a checking account,
but no savings.

10:51.040 --> 10:53.960
They'd deposit $1000 every two weeks
to write checks against.

10:54.120 --> 10:56.040
Father owned a butcher shop
for years.

10:56.200 --> 10:58.040
Probably squirreled away
a small fortune.

10:58.200 --> 11:01.560
We should put out the word
for any kids blowing cash.

11:01.960 --> 11:04.120
- What?
- I should've thought of that. Good idea.

11:04.280 --> 11:06.160
You would have, given time.

11:06.960 --> 11:08.960
Dae, you're here.
Could you do us a favour?

11:09.160 --> 11:10.880
- What?
- We need to talk to this woman.

11:11.040 --> 11:13.560
She doesn't speak English.
Can you translate for us?

11:13.720 --> 11:15.720
- I don't speak Korean.
- Really?

11:16.040 --> 11:18.320
I was born in Torrance.

11:19.560 --> 11:23.280
- Dae speaks less Korean than you do.
- Better call Division for a translator.

11:23.440 --> 11:26.280
Already done.
You feeling all right?

11:26.440 --> 11:27.440
Yeah. Sure.

11:27.600 --> 11:30.400
Then pick up the pace.
You're doing a 12-minute mile.

11:57.360 --> 12:00.400
- Hello, Maureen.
- David Segovia Aceveda.

12:00.560 --> 12:02.880
I knocked but...

12:03.040 --> 12:06.000
A little out of your comfort zone,
aren't you?

12:06.520 --> 12:12.200
I struggled with whether to come here
or not. A phone call didn't feel right.

12:12.400 --> 12:16.720
- I hope I didn't catch you at a bad time.
- She interviewed me two days ago.

12:18.400 --> 12:21.840
When you pursue a council seat,
they open up all your closets.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.640
And I'm your biggest skeleton.

12:24.800 --> 12:28.400
Actually, it was quite healing,
sharing what happened.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.840
And what did you tell her happened?

12:30.960 --> 12:34.760
The ambitious Latino pursued the rich
white girl, got her drunk, tied her up...

12:34.960 --> 12:37.320
...subjected her to sexual acts
against her will.

12:37.480 --> 12:40.560
He continued to stalk her obsessively
until one night she was forced...

12:40.720 --> 12:43.440
...to fend him off with a penknife.
Am I leaving anything out?

12:43.600 --> 12:45.640
Just the truth.

12:45.800 --> 12:48.560
I thought maybe your hatred
for me would...

12:48.720 --> 12:51.760
- It's been 15 years, Maureen.
- Fifteen years later, I still hurt.

12:51.920 --> 12:53.880
- What do you want from me now?
- An apology.

12:54.080 --> 12:56.120
- I'm sorry you felt hurt.
- An admission.

12:56.280 --> 12:58.880
- I did nothing wrong.
- We'll let the public decide.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.480
My friends, they know people
at this newspaper.

13:02.640 --> 13:05.320
One phone call, the whole story
will just disappear.

13:05.480 --> 13:07.640
Then why did you come here?

13:07.800 --> 13:11.160
I thought we could make some sort
of peace after all this time.

13:11.360 --> 13:14.720
Then you wasted a trip.
I have to get back to work.

13:27.920 --> 13:29.600
What happened?

13:29.760 --> 13:32.840
We were gathering peacefully,
then shots rang out.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.520
How's your buddy?

13:34.680 --> 13:38.360
He hit his head diving for cover,
but that's the only casualty.

13:38.520 --> 13:39.800
- Lucky.
- Allah's will.

13:39.960 --> 13:43.440
- Know who did it?
- Rondell Robinson.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.840
- How do you know that?
- Because we saw him.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.160
He was fast and we tried to catch him.
We couldn't, but we will.

13:49.320 --> 13:52.240
No. I will.
You just file your police report...

13:52.400 --> 13:54.720
...and let us handle grabbing
up Rondell.

13:54.920 --> 13:58.440
- I have little faith in your cooperation.
- Sounds like we're working together.

13:58.600 --> 14:01.680
We're not.
You stay out of my way.

14:01.840 --> 14:05.640
That's easy.
We're headed in opposite directions.

14:15.840 --> 14:18.680
My father lost his life savings.

14:19.840 --> 14:21.600
He couldn't protect my mother.

14:24.680 --> 14:26.920
He would've been ashamed.

14:27.960 --> 14:29.600
He must've felt he had no choice.

14:29.800 --> 14:33.440
We think her father knew his attackers.
They talked for a while before.

14:33.600 --> 14:36.600
Does she have any idea
who would do this?

14:42.760 --> 14:44.800
No idea.

14:44.960 --> 14:46.880
We're sorry about your loss.

14:51.920 --> 14:53.720
I'm off in there.

14:53.880 --> 14:55.800
Leave your A game
in your cereal bowl?

14:55.960 --> 14:58.440
Through a translator, there's
no back and forth. No rhythm.

14:58.640 --> 15:02.880
- I say she's lying about something.
- You learn Korean in the last half-hour?

15:03.040 --> 15:06.360
I don't tell liars by listening.
I tell them by watching.

15:06.520 --> 15:09.280
Body language? Come on,
it's a completely different culture.

15:09.440 --> 15:12.120
People are people, aren't they?

15:13.360 --> 15:16.160
I'm sorry to have to tell you this.
Matthew's been wait-listed.

15:16.360 --> 15:18.440
- Wait-listed?
- But you said we were in.

15:19.080 --> 15:21.040
The board had to review
your application.

15:21.200 --> 15:22.280
What's the problem?

15:22.440 --> 15:26.040
The Glenridge families
are a very tightknit community.

15:26.200 --> 15:29.240
The admissions board selected
a family they felt...

15:29.400 --> 15:32.040
- The Demicellis interviewed last week...
- Last week?

15:32.200 --> 15:34.240
I thought the deadline
was three weeks ago.

15:34.840 --> 15:37.760
- There were special circumstances.
- What special circumstances?

15:39.120 --> 15:42.640
Some of our trustees saw an article
in the paper.

15:42.800 --> 15:46.520
- You and some other officers...
- My husband didn't steal those drugs.

15:46.680 --> 15:49.480
- The charges were dropped.
- Yeah, if I really did that...

15:49.600 --> 15:52.920
...do you think I'd still have my job?
- I'm sorry.

15:53.080 --> 15:56.160
There are other programs that
are quite good for autistic children.

15:56.320 --> 15:59.200
We don't want another program.

15:59.520 --> 16:01.760
- How long is the wait list?
- Nine months, a year.

16:01.920 --> 16:05.400
Matthew's behind already.
He's drowning socially.

16:05.600 --> 16:08.160
I really am very sorry.

16:09.560 --> 16:11.680
- Hey, Danny, you got a sec?
- What's up?

16:11.840 --> 16:15.280
Linda here decided to have
a crack party in her El Camino.

16:15.840 --> 16:16.840
That's nice.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.880
Problem is, she likes to keep her
stash where the sun don't shine.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.040
- You up for a strip search?
- Ask some rookie.

16:23.520 --> 16:26.160
You're the only female uniform here.

16:32.160 --> 16:33.560
Come with me.

16:35.520 --> 16:38.720
- Okay, lean over.
- I got my period.

16:38.880 --> 16:42.080
- Keep your mouth shut, please.
- Yo, my lips are sealed.

16:42.280 --> 16:44.680
Not for long.
Put your palms on the floor.

16:44.840 --> 16:47.280
Come on.
You don't have to touch my string.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.840
Hey.

16:57.080 --> 16:59.240
Who's in charge here?

16:59.400 --> 17:02.080
- I'm the captain. Can I help you?
- We have a citizen's arrest.

17:02.320 --> 17:05.440
They were selling crack cocaine
on the street corner.

17:07.359 --> 17:09.599
Go ahead and book them.
I'll need your statement.

17:10.280 --> 17:14.119
This is my statement:
We will not rest until the dealers...

17:14.640 --> 17:18.680
...and the police who provide
them comfort are brought to justice.

17:29.400 --> 17:32.720
Farmington has a veneer
of tranquillity...

17:32.880 --> 17:35.120
...but the dermis is infected.

17:35.280 --> 17:37.800
Could you be more specific
about the dermis?

17:38.000 --> 17:40.840
Those drug dealers that we
apprehended, they might as well...

17:41.000 --> 17:44.360
...have been wearing a sign that read,
I have no fear of being arrested.

17:44.560 --> 17:47.240
- Really?
- I couldn't believe it. It...

17:47.400 --> 17:49.520
It was clear that they
were just soldiers.

17:49.840 --> 17:52.120
The captains and the general
are still at large.

17:52.280 --> 17:54.280
Any idea who they might be?

17:55.000 --> 17:56.920
Hey, Vic.

17:57.080 --> 18:00.480
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Look, this is the only place safe, man.

18:00.640 --> 18:03.120
I tried to kill them bastards,
man, but I missed.

18:03.280 --> 18:05.080
I can't let them find me, Vic.

18:05.240 --> 18:06.920
Vic.

18:08.920 --> 18:11.400
You're a dealer!
You can't be coming where I work!

18:11.560 --> 18:14.600
- They looking for me out there!
- They're looking for you in here!

18:14.760 --> 18:16.360
You're supposed to help me, Vic.

18:16.520 --> 18:18.440
You been telling the Muslims
I'm backing you?

18:18.600 --> 18:22.560
What kind of good is police protection
if no one knows about it, huh?

18:22.720 --> 18:25.600
- Go home. Stay there.
- I can't go home!

18:26.080 --> 18:28.080
They could be waiting for me, man.

18:28.240 --> 18:31.360
Well, go somewhere
because you ain't staying here.

18:31.520 --> 18:34.720
If I go down, I ain't going
down alone, Vic!

18:34.880 --> 18:36.920
- What?
- That's right. You heard me.

18:37.080 --> 18:40.960
You better do something about it.
You better do something.

18:46.880 --> 18:47.040
I've had my suspicions
about Rondell.

18:47.040 --> 18:49.120
I've had my suspicions
about Rondell.

18:49.320 --> 18:53.040
Questioned how he so easily
operated within our district.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.400
What cops do you believe
he's in league with?

18:55.560 --> 18:57.040
I'd rather not say at this time.

18:57.200 --> 19:00.640
- Come on.
- Not until there's 100 percent certainty.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.520
The wait won't be long.

19:02.680 --> 19:05.040
Where will you be if I need
to speak with you?

19:05.160 --> 19:08.240
In your lobby. Until we're
satisfied that this matter...

19:08.440 --> 19:12.040
...has been settled, the Nation
is not leaving this building.

19:37.960 --> 19:41.360
Tomas, I spoke to your legal aid guy.

19:41.720 --> 19:46.040
Stealing CDs, look,
what were you thinking?

19:46.200 --> 19:50.000
With your prior record,
he said you could get prison time.

19:52.360 --> 19:56.480
Hey. Say something.

20:02.040 --> 20:04.080
- You abandoned me.
- What?

20:06.160 --> 20:08.960
- You never called.
- That cop told me not to call.

20:09.800 --> 20:12.000
He tell you the same thing?

20:12.280 --> 20:14.040
I wanted you to call.

20:14.400 --> 20:17.720
I needed you to call.

20:18.640 --> 20:22.320
- I'm sorry.
- It's too late now.

20:24.040 --> 20:26.080
I'm going away.

20:27.120 --> 20:29.080
I'm scared.

20:34.080 --> 20:37.400
I screwed up, I know, but...

20:39.280 --> 20:41.440
...where were you for me?

20:47.320 --> 20:50.000
What do we know about the family
that got Matthew bumped?

20:50.160 --> 20:53.880
Banker and his second wife, living
large. The got a house in Brentwood...

20:54.080 --> 20:55.320
...a ranch in Telluride.

20:55.480 --> 20:58.360
So Matthew's stuck because this
rich prick can buy his way in?

20:58.520 --> 21:00.240
It sucks. I'm sorry.

21:00.400 --> 21:02.920
- What about the dirt on him?
- There's nothing. Nothing.

21:03.080 --> 21:04.120
There is nothing.

21:04.280 --> 21:06.160
- What about Ms. Emerich?
- She's clean.

21:06.320 --> 21:08.840
- There's gotta be something.
- She's an administrator.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.800
- She's pristine.
- Domestic abuse, an alcoholic brother.

21:11.960 --> 21:13.240
Give me something I can use.

21:13.400 --> 21:15.320
The only record of her
is a police report...

21:15.480 --> 21:17.920
...that she filed
when her house was broken into.

21:18.080 --> 21:20.080
Well, let me see it.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.520
Excuse us, detectives.

21:22.680 --> 21:25.240
What? I got a million things
going on here.

21:25.440 --> 21:27.280
A million and one.

21:36.240 --> 21:39.320
Xavier Salaam has an interesting take
on how dealers keep managing...

21:39.480 --> 21:43.280
...to slip through the cracks.
He's got his men out doing your job.

21:44.320 --> 21:46.520
Salaam also thinks someone
took a shot at him.

21:46.680 --> 21:49.880
- Rondell Robinson, to be exact.
- Still to be proven.

21:50.040 --> 21:52.480
By five or six eyewitnesses.

21:52.640 --> 21:55.680
Couple of uniforms went by Rondell's
house. He wasn't there.

21:55.880 --> 21:59.000
He shouldn't be too hard
to find, though.

21:59.440 --> 22:02.200
It'll be real interesting to hear
what Rondell has to say.

22:03.640 --> 22:05.440
You doing okay?
You don't look so hot.

22:06.720 --> 22:10.040
- I'm fine.
- Good.

22:11.840 --> 22:14.320
I'll leave you to your work, then.

22:19.120 --> 22:23.560
Maybe it's all in the family.
Rhee-Soo has a son with a rap sheet.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.280
Think the kid went
from loitering and shoplifting...

22:27.440 --> 22:30.320
...to strangling Grams and nailing
Grandpa's feet to the floor?

22:30.480 --> 22:33.280
They probably had 10s of thousands
of dollars in that mattress.

22:33.440 --> 22:35.360
Who else but a family
would know about it?

22:35.520 --> 22:39.720
No way. Robbing the grandparents,
maybe, but nailing the feet?

22:39.880 --> 22:42.600
You rarely see that kind
of sadism amongst family members.

22:42.760 --> 22:45.400
Let's see your list of suspects.

22:45.560 --> 22:48.960
Three Korean male teens just spent
a ton of cash on jewellery.

22:49.160 --> 22:51.800
I wrote the address in English for you.

22:52.680 --> 22:54.440
Thanks.

22:56.520 --> 23:00.320
Hope you found your game
because I'm on mine.

23:01.080 --> 23:04.880
Three boys. Very flashy.
Spent over 7000.

23:05.040 --> 23:07.720
- On what?
- Chains. Men's and the woman's.

23:07.880 --> 23:11.680
- Thank you.
- Have you seen any of these boys?

23:16.440 --> 23:18.840
Him. He bought the biggest bracelet.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.800
He paid for all the stuff in cash.

23:20.960 --> 23:23.640
Probably Christmas gifts
for the rest of the family.

23:23.800 --> 23:26.160
Do you have the cash they spent?
We need it.

23:26.320 --> 23:30.600
- You give me different $7000?
- No. We'll give you a voucher.

23:31.120 --> 23:34.880
- When do I get the money back?
- It's evidence in a murder.

23:35.040 --> 23:37.840
If we retrieve the merchandise,
we'll see it's returned to you.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.040
So I never get my jewellery
back either, right?

23:41.320 --> 23:44.040
- Why did I even call the police?
- You're a good citizen.

23:44.360 --> 23:47.960
Not anymore. Too expensive.

23:49.160 --> 23:53.200
All right, ladies, backs
against the cage. No talking.

23:54.880 --> 23:57.640
You finger yourself after
you finger me? You bitch.

23:57.840 --> 24:00.960
Hey, watch your mouth.
Show her some respect.

24:01.160 --> 24:02.160
Hey, relax.

24:02.320 --> 24:06.000
Come on, ladies, your ride's here.
Move it along, single file.

24:06.160 --> 24:09.000
I don't need you in someone's face
every time they look at me.

24:09.160 --> 24:10.480
I'm just sticking up for you.

24:10.640 --> 24:13.280
Yeah, like you did with that
drag queen who bit me?

24:13.440 --> 24:14.560
What?

24:14.720 --> 24:17.720
Mackelroy just told me about
the blanket party you guys threw.

24:17.880 --> 24:20.160
What the hell were you thinking?

24:20.640 --> 24:23.520
Julien, that guy is seriously hurt.

24:23.680 --> 24:26.000
Why would you do that?
Is that who you are now?

24:26.200 --> 24:28.640
- After what he did to you?
- Exactly. To me.

24:28.800 --> 24:31.240
- You should've stayed out of it.
- He tried to kill you.

24:31.400 --> 24:33.880
He's the criminal, remember, Julien?

24:34.320 --> 24:36.760
After all the problems we had,
I thought the one thing...

24:36.920 --> 24:40.000
...that I could count on was
the fact that you had a good heart.

24:42.480 --> 24:45.520
Okay, boys, your turn. Let's go.

24:51.560 --> 24:54.080
Machado and his hatchet men
had my story killed.

24:54.240 --> 24:55.600
I'm sure there'll be more.

24:55.760 --> 24:58.080
Like the Nation of Islam standing
in your lobby.

24:58.760 --> 25:02.600
That'll be the second one I sell.
I left La Unidad.

25:02.760 --> 25:06.080
I'm freelancing now.
My first sale was to the Times.

25:06.280 --> 25:08.520
It's a piece about an ambitious
police captain...

25:08.680 --> 25:13.280
...who uses aggressive tactics
to hurt people and squelch the truth.

25:13.440 --> 25:16.000
Just like you did 15 years ago.

25:16.200 --> 25:18.200
I thought you'd like
to see a first draft.

25:18.360 --> 25:20.640
Feel free to call with any questions.

25:20.840 --> 25:23.040
If he ain't here,
I don't know where he's hiding.

25:23.240 --> 25:26.280
We used to come up here all the time
when we were shorties.

25:26.440 --> 25:28.680
Yo, Rondell!

25:29.840 --> 25:33.000
Rondell! Put the gun down,
you shithead!

25:33.160 --> 25:36.040
- Vic!
- Yeah, and Kern!

25:36.480 --> 25:38.560
- You two okay, man?
- You shot at me!

25:38.720 --> 25:40.760
- Mackey, let me talk to him.
- Well, I'm done!

25:40.960 --> 25:42.800
Vic, I didn't know it was...

25:44.840 --> 25:47.200
- You shoot at me, you die!
- Vic, man, no!

25:47.400 --> 25:50.640
- No! No! No!
- Chill, man. What you doing!

25:50.840 --> 25:52.640
- No!
- Chill, Mackey. Mackey...

25:52.840 --> 25:54.320
- You wanna join him?
- Vic!

25:54.520 --> 25:56.680
Look at all the people
down there. That's my boy.

25:56.920 --> 25:59.600
- We got history. Chill.
- He could've killed you and me.

25:59.760 --> 26:02.040
- He's a problem.
- No, no!

26:02.240 --> 26:03.280
- No! Chill, man!
- No!

26:03.480 --> 26:05.560
No, Mackey, no! No.
Chill. Chill, man.

26:05.720 --> 26:07.640
He won't be a problem.
I'll take him someplace...

26:07.800 --> 26:10.840
...where these cats won't get him.
Just chill. I'm all over it!

26:11.040 --> 26:13.120
Just chill, all right? Just chill.

26:13.320 --> 26:15.000
Come on, man.

26:16.440 --> 26:19.600
If he's a problem again,
you got a problem.

26:19.800 --> 26:22.320
Next time you better grow wings.

26:41.240 --> 26:43.120
- What are you doing?
- Getting us privacy.

26:43.280 --> 26:45.200
- What for?
- Explain to me why it wasn't...

26:45.360 --> 26:48.960
...the stupidest move of your life to try
to take out Kern Little with Rondell.

26:49.120 --> 26:51.840
Rondell was telling everybody
that you and Kern had his back.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.200
That y'all were dealing out retribution
if any harm came Rondell's way.

26:55.400 --> 26:57.800
Let me get this straight.
After Rondell and Kern...

26:57.960 --> 27:00.600
...you were gonna come after me?
- No way, man. You?

27:00.760 --> 27:03.280
- I knew I could reason with.
- Start reasoning, then.

27:03.480 --> 27:05.200
What do you wanna know?

27:06.120 --> 27:07.920
Why are you a better dealer for me?

27:08.080 --> 27:11.000
I don't use my own product.
Rondell does, more and more.

27:11.200 --> 27:14.440
He's getting sloppy. This Nation of
Islam thing came on when he was high.

27:15.840 --> 27:18.600
- How would you have handled it?
- Let them have the corner.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.960
Move three blocks over.

27:21.120 --> 27:22.960
Dopers follow the dope.

27:23.120 --> 27:25.760
Pissing off the bean pie crowd
gives them a reason to live.

27:26.200 --> 27:30.320
Throw a little bit of that peaceful
resistance right back at them, huh?

27:31.520 --> 27:34.200
Now, if I'm done filling
out the job application...

27:34.360 --> 27:37.160
...let's talk about how
much rent's gonna be.

27:39.840 --> 27:44.600
Actually, 50 grand lets
you move in right away.

27:45.840 --> 27:48.320
Good thing I've been saving.

27:53.480 --> 27:55.120
It's a good thing.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.920
David...

28:07.080 --> 28:10.320
...what's wrong?
- Hang on.

28:13.160 --> 28:14.880
Shit.

28:21.880 --> 28:25.320
I'm sorry.
I just can't seem to focus.

28:25.880 --> 28:30.120
- Varela interviewed Maureen Wilmore.
- Oh, God.

28:30.280 --> 28:32.000
She still blames me
for what happened...

28:32.160 --> 28:34.960
...and now the article
could run in the Times.

28:35.120 --> 28:36.920
Great.

28:37.200 --> 28:40.520
- I went to talk to Maureen.
- What? When?

28:40.680 --> 28:42.000
- Today.
- Why?

28:42.360 --> 28:45.760
I thought maybe
if I could convince her...

28:46.000 --> 28:47.600
But she's sticking to her story.

28:47.760 --> 28:50.560
- What did you expect?
- I was hoping I could reason with her.

28:50.720 --> 28:53.000
Reason with her?
You said she was a crazy girl.

28:53.200 --> 28:58.440
- That was 15 years ago.
- David, 15 years is nothing to a woman.

29:04.280 --> 29:07.840
My guy at the Times says the editor
likes it, but can't confirm it'll run.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.560
What happens if it does?

29:09.720 --> 29:13.760
Change your name to Kennedy, move
to Massachusetts and you'll be fine.

29:14.800 --> 29:17.200
- It's critical, but it's not fatal...
- Isn't this libel?

29:17.360 --> 29:19.960
Technically, yes. The law
presumes a statement is false...

29:20.120 --> 29:21.960
...unless she can prove the contrary.

29:22.120 --> 29:24.000
You show damages, you have a case.

29:24.160 --> 29:26.320
But the damage to you
will already be done.

29:26.480 --> 29:29.280
- What are my options?
- You get this woman to recant.

29:29.480 --> 29:31.680
- I already tried.
- Try again.

29:32.000 --> 29:36.200
She wants me to admit I hurt her.
Apologise for a rape I didn't commit.

29:36.360 --> 29:39.400
- I won't do it.
- If she's willing to make it go away...

29:39.560 --> 29:41.080
...you give her what she wants.

29:41.240 --> 29:43.320
Won't Varela still print the story?

29:43.520 --> 29:46.800
Not if this woman denies it.
It's survival, David.

29:46.960 --> 29:48.920
You wanted in the game.

29:49.080 --> 29:51.640
Now is when it starts to get fun.

29:53.800 --> 29:56.640
- Ms. Emerich.
- Mr. Mackey.

29:57.280 --> 30:01.240
- Look, I understand your frustration.
- Actually, I'm here on police business.

30:01.400 --> 30:02.400
What's that?

30:02.560 --> 30:05.920
I understand you had a ring stolen
from your house about a month ago.

30:06.080 --> 30:08.200
The report said it was an heirloom.

30:08.360 --> 30:11.960
Yes, it was my mother's. I was hoping
to give it to my daughter someday.

30:12.120 --> 30:14.920
- Can I be brutally honest with you?
- Okay.

30:15.080 --> 30:17.560
Hollywood Division's never
gonna get your ring back.

30:17.720 --> 30:19.760
- I figured.
- Let me explain.

30:19.920 --> 30:22.560
The police have the resources
to solve almost any crime.

30:22.720 --> 30:24.360
Just a matter
of making it a priority.

30:24.560 --> 30:27.680
To them, a stolen ring
doesn't rate very high.

30:27.840 --> 30:29.800
I guess not.

30:30.520 --> 30:33.160
I can see it's very important to you.

30:34.760 --> 30:36.920
Maybe there's something I can do.

30:42.600 --> 30:44.040
Looks like they're not budging.

30:44.200 --> 30:46.400
Guess not. Did you find the ring?

30:46.560 --> 30:48.320
I gave your guy
a detailed description.

30:48.480 --> 30:51.480
It hasn't passed through his pawnshop,
but he's checking around.

30:51.760 --> 30:55.880
Guy's kind of whacked. He bet me
50 bucks he could find it in 12 hours.

30:56.040 --> 30:57.840
- Did you take the bet?
- Oh, damn right.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.800
Bad move. You don't know Felipe.

31:03.040 --> 31:06.840
We know your son, Nam Yung,
has been in trouble before.

31:12.200 --> 31:13.760
She only wants to talk to him.

31:14.240 --> 31:17.360
- What? Why?
- Because she doesn't wanna talk to me.

31:17.680 --> 31:19.480
Why?

31:20.000 --> 31:25.040
- Oh, no. You tell her we don't do that.
- Dutch, whatever. As long as she talks.

31:25.960 --> 31:27.920
Fine.

31:28.120 --> 31:30.760
Ask if there's any ill will between
her son and her parents.

31:30.920 --> 31:32.960
- She won't answer.
- Would you let her decide?

31:33.120 --> 31:35.080
I'm sorry. I know she won't.

31:35.240 --> 31:37.960
If she thinks we're prying into
her family, she'll shut down.

31:38.160 --> 31:42.240
- So I can't even do my job now?
- Dutch, just work with it.

31:46.280 --> 31:49.080
We're looking for Nam Yung
and his friends Kenny and Paul.

31:49.240 --> 31:51.040
They were arrested together
in the past.

31:51.200 --> 31:53.800
Do you have any idea
where they are now?

32:02.000 --> 32:04.160
He stayed at Kenny's house
last night.

32:04.320 --> 32:08.640
We talked to Kenny's mother.
She thought they were at your house.

32:13.160 --> 32:15.120
I guess teenage lies
are pretty universal.

32:15.280 --> 32:17.320
I never told that one before.

32:17.480 --> 32:20.160
Detectives, there's been
another home invasion.

32:22.920 --> 32:25.080
Our home-wreckers left
their hammers behind.

32:25.240 --> 32:26.480
This family gave it up.

32:26.640 --> 32:29.760
No one's talking, but whatever
they took, they took it all.

32:29.920 --> 32:32.480
- Who called 911?
- I did.

32:34.640 --> 32:38.160
They don't like to talk about these kind
of things in front of other people.

32:44.200 --> 32:46.280
- What happened?
- They got all our money.

32:46.480 --> 32:49.320
They took my Xbox.
They took the games too.

32:49.480 --> 32:51.160
Well, did you recognise any of them?

32:51.320 --> 32:54.640
Sure, it was my cousin
and his two buddies.

32:57.520 --> 33:00.320
Look, I just want my Xbox back.

33:12.760 --> 33:15.000
Graduation party. Kid's got a gun.
One Tango 13...

33:15.200 --> 33:17.840
...requesting assistance,
8266 Alameda.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.640
You go through the house,
I'll take the side.

33:26.080 --> 33:27.520
Come on, stay out front. Move.

33:27.720 --> 33:29.480
Go. Move.

33:52.480 --> 33:54.520
Julien, wait!

33:56.480 --> 33:59.360
One Tango 13, shots fired!
Move it!

34:23.679 --> 34:25.080
Get back.

34:25.239 --> 34:27.679
I'll shoot, man.
I swear, I'll shoot.

34:27.880 --> 34:29.840
Are you deaf?

34:34.239 --> 34:38.000
I said, I'll shoot you.
Get away from me.

34:38.159 --> 34:40.520
- Go ahead.
- You wanna die?

34:41.760 --> 34:44.480
- Shoot me.
- I said, I'll shoot you!

34:45.120 --> 34:46.679
Shoot!

34:46.840 --> 34:48.920
Julien!

34:52.480 --> 34:54.560
Give me the gun.

34:54.760 --> 34:57.840
- Get on the ground.
- Julien.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.560
I got him.

35:01.080 --> 35:02.680
I got him.

35:05.400 --> 35:07.640
Hey, you guys all right?

35:24.920 --> 35:27.280
- Nice work, Julien.
- I'm just glad everyone's safe.

35:27.440 --> 35:28.720
Well, it could've been bad.

35:28.920 --> 35:32.960
Who knows, come commendation time,
maybe we'll hear your name.

35:35.440 --> 35:37.080
Way to go.

35:38.360 --> 35:42.480
- Yeah, you're a real hero.
- What's that supposed to mean?

35:43.800 --> 35:47.400
- You're not wearing a vest, are you?
- I forgot to wear it today.

35:47.560 --> 35:49.200
You holstered your weapon
at the scene.

35:49.360 --> 35:52.280
- After the suspect was on the ground.
- I talked to the suspect.

35:52.480 --> 35:55.960
- I made the arrest, all right?
- Did you wanna get shot?

35:59.400 --> 36:01.760
Julien, did you wanna die?

36:03.840 --> 36:06.880
Why? You can tell me.

36:07.640 --> 36:10.800
I do things that can't be forgiven
and I can't stop myself.

36:10.960 --> 36:12.600
I know.

36:12.760 --> 36:16.400
- You have no idea.
- You're gay, okay?

36:16.560 --> 36:20.400
I'm your partner.
I know it's not worth dying for.

36:22.320 --> 36:26.360
- Fighting this is killing me.
- Then stop fighting.

36:26.560 --> 36:30.680
- I would rather die than be that.
- You don't mean that.

36:30.840 --> 36:34.160
I can't go on like this. I can't.

36:38.440 --> 36:40.200
What's up, money?

36:41.680 --> 36:43.080
I got the name of your shooter.

36:43.240 --> 36:45.200
- Who?
- Tio.

36:45.360 --> 36:46.960
- That's Rondell's dog.
- Used to be.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.360
I'll make sure no blood
don't spill your way.

36:51.520 --> 36:53.120
There's more.

36:53.480 --> 36:56.720
- Rondell's out. This kid, Tio, he's in.
- What?

36:56.880 --> 36:59.560
Rondell's been blabbing
you and me are protecting him.

37:00.040 --> 37:01.400
That's just Rondell talking.

37:01.560 --> 37:04.800
Well, that talk got your car shot up
and the Nation of Islam camped out...

37:04.960 --> 37:07.000
...in my back yard trying
to make me the devil.

37:07.160 --> 37:11.240
Rondell's using.
He could've killed us both yesterday.

37:11.400 --> 37:15.360
He nearly messed up a relationship
that's gonna be very valuable to me.

37:18.200 --> 37:22.040
He got one of my acts high.
Ruined the whole session.

37:23.920 --> 37:26.960
Tio's prepared to make restitution.
I'm making the change.

37:27.120 --> 37:30.120
Whether you wanna fight it
or not is up to you.

37:32.160 --> 37:36.120
Me and Rondell, we grew up together,
man. We got a lot of history, son.

37:36.280 --> 37:38.440
People change.

37:40.800 --> 37:43.400
I don't really recognise him no more.

37:44.560 --> 37:46.760
So, what do we do now?

37:48.440 --> 37:50.760
Tell him it's safe to go home.

37:50.920 --> 37:53.840
Then we let the street take care of it.

38:11.280 --> 38:12.760
Freeze! Facedown!

38:12.920 --> 38:15.480
Get your hands behind your back!
Get down!

38:15.640 --> 38:18.000
- We're clear!
- Clear!

38:18.160 --> 38:21.280
When I was a kid,
we just tipped cows.

38:22.160 --> 38:26.480
The three of you decided
to rob your own relatives?

38:27.120 --> 38:30.080
We just wanted what
the other kids had.

38:31.720 --> 38:35.400
- You killed your grandmother.
- No, Kenny did that.

38:35.560 --> 38:37.680
You didn't stop them.

38:38.800 --> 38:41.920
They should've just told us
where the money was.

38:42.080 --> 38:46.360
You nailed your grandfather's
feet to the floor.

38:46.880 --> 38:49.160
Kenny did that too.

38:49.520 --> 38:51.400
Why?

38:51.720 --> 38:54.720
Grandfather kept following us around.

38:55.280 --> 38:57.480
He wouldn't sit still.

39:10.280 --> 39:14.000
- Oh, my God.
- It's beautiful.

39:14.600 --> 39:17.680
- I can't believe you got it back.
- Just have to know where to look.

39:18.200 --> 39:20.400
I don't know how to thank you.

39:20.680 --> 39:23.080
You know how to thank me.

39:24.000 --> 39:27.920
- I don't know. It's a little late.
- Special circumstances.

39:28.960 --> 39:32.200
Look, my family will be
a great asset to this school.

39:39.560 --> 39:40.920
You win.

39:41.080 --> 39:43.440
- You've arrested Rondell Robinson?
- Not yet.

39:43.600 --> 39:45.720
But he's not gonna be a problem
for you anymore.

39:45.920 --> 39:49.000
- He was your problem, not ours.
- Well, we're both on the same side.

39:49.160 --> 39:51.200
I doubt that.

39:52.280 --> 39:54.720
There's nothing I can say
to you, is there?

39:54.880 --> 39:56.840
Admit you're evil.

39:58.240 --> 40:00.280
I'm out of here.

40:00.440 --> 40:03.680
Sure you don't wanna wait
this out at a Best Western?

40:04.040 --> 40:07.280
- Hell of a lot more restful.
- You get your rest, detective.

40:07.440 --> 40:11.080
The peddlers of illegal drugs can hide,
but we know where to find you.

40:11.240 --> 40:15.040
As long as you keep it legal,
you'll get no trouble from me.

40:15.200 --> 40:17.080
You have a good night.

40:20.520 --> 40:23.400
- Thank you for seeing me.
- What do you want, David?

40:23.560 --> 40:25.560
I know you're still upset.
I understand that.

40:25.800 --> 40:29.040
But I need you to tell the truth
about what happened that night.

40:29.200 --> 40:31.120
You need me?

40:35.280 --> 40:38.000
- Don't.
- Remember?

40:39.880 --> 40:41.920
I'm married now.

40:55.160 --> 40:57.680
- Stop it.
- You wanna save your political career?

40:58.040 --> 41:01.120
Then I want you to say it,
say it just once.

41:01.280 --> 41:04.760
Admit what you did to me
so I know I wasn't crazy.

41:18.840 --> 41:20.040
Asshole.

41:20.200 --> 41:22.120
You're recording this?
You're unbelievable.

41:22.320 --> 41:24.680
Varela said it was the only way
to print the story.

41:24.880 --> 41:26.480
Why are you doing this?

41:26.640 --> 41:28.760
I was just a kid.

41:28.920 --> 41:31.400
I wanted to explore sexually.
So what?

41:31.560 --> 41:33.960
- That's right. You wanted to explore.
- You loved it.

41:34.160 --> 41:37.080
Then you go tell your friends
about the crazy white bitch...

41:37.240 --> 41:38.960
...who likes to be tied up
and choked.

41:39.120 --> 41:42.320
- What?
- Two of them came to my room.

41:42.480 --> 41:46.560
They held me down and raped me.

41:47.440 --> 41:50.080
They said they heard
that I liked that.

41:50.280 --> 41:52.000
Oh, my God.

41:52.240 --> 41:55.600
- Who?
- Mark and Peter.

41:56.880 --> 41:58.640
Don't tell me you don't remember.

41:58.800 --> 42:02.000
I don't. Mark and Peter,
I barely knew them.

42:02.160 --> 42:05.800
You knew them well enough
to tell them how to hurt me.

42:06.200 --> 42:09.280
- Oh, Maureen.
- You sent them there to rape me.

42:09.480 --> 42:13.920
- No, I didn't. I am so sorry...
- Don't touch me. You are responsible.

42:14.080 --> 42:16.080
- Maureen, I am so sorry.
- Stay away from me.

42:16.240 --> 42:18.920
You tell that slut you married
I feel sorry for her.

42:19.080 --> 42:20.960
Maureen.

42:27.680 --> 42:29.320
Hey.

42:30.720 --> 42:34.200
- Something you wanna tell me?
- I love you?

42:34.400 --> 42:36.680
Well, I love you too.
Now, how'd you do it?

42:36.840 --> 42:38.040
Do what?

42:38.240 --> 42:40.760
Matthew was accepted
into Glenridge.

42:40.920 --> 42:43.960
- Really? That's great.
- Oh, please. Stop with the act.

42:44.120 --> 42:47.520
Yesterday you were a criminal,
today she calls to set an orientation.

42:47.680 --> 42:50.400
- Fess up.
- It could happen.

42:50.560 --> 42:53.760
- What did you do?
- Nothing any dad wouldn't do.

42:54.520 --> 42:56.240
Come here.

42:58.000 --> 43:02.080
Well, thank you.
Matthew really needs this.

43:02.240 --> 43:04.800
What about the other family?

43:05.200 --> 43:09.120
They missed the deadline.
They broke the rules.

43:11.360 --> 43:14.600
Don't worry. They'll be fine.
They're loaded.

43:15.160 --> 43:17.640
You and the kids come first.

43:22.120 --> 43:25.480
Remind me not to get
on your bad side.

43:32.520 --> 43:36.520
Young black male, shot numerous
times at close range.

43:36.680 --> 43:39.840
No witnesses.
Now we're talking my language.

43:40.240 --> 43:43.720
- Don't tell me.
- Oh, yeah. I think I'm back.

43:43.880 --> 43:46.640
Oh, God help us.
