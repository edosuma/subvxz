00:00.226 --> 00:02.469
Previously, on "Another Period"...

00:06.773 --> 00:08.074
Poor Lillian's memory was erased.

00:08.108 --> 00:09.643
You don't remember who you are,

00:09.676 --> 00:10.811
and you don't remember where you are.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.446
That's about right.

00:12.479 --> 00:14.114
We should get you home, shouldn't we?

00:14.147 --> 00:15.582
I live here?

00:15.616 --> 00:17.417
And you make love to me
with no protection

00:17.451 --> 00:18.619
because you're my wife.

00:18.652 --> 00:20.554
My prince charming left a clue!

00:20.587 --> 00:22.322
Come back, mystery lady!

00:22.356 --> 00:24.424
Frederick is your beloved!

00:24.458 --> 00:25.826
It's his name in the ring!

00:25.859 --> 00:27.160
This is not my baby.

00:27.194 --> 00:28.495
This is the wrong baby! This is not...

00:28.529 --> 00:30.430
this is the wrong baby!

00:30.464 --> 00:32.131
I'm running for president?

00:32.165 --> 00:34.334
Oh, fantastic!

00:34.368 --> 00:35.769
Frederick for president!

00:35.802 --> 00:37.671
If we want to be president in '08,

00:37.704 --> 00:39.473
we've gotta go straight to the people.

00:39.506 --> 00:40.541
Frederick for president!

00:42.309 --> 00:43.844
Oh, Frederick!

00:43.877 --> 00:46.380
Remember, all you have to do is wave.

00:46.413 --> 00:47.381
No words.

00:47.414 --> 00:50.083
Just put your hand up and wave.

00:50.117 --> 00:51.852
Do you understand?

00:51.885 --> 00:53.487
- No words.
- What are you going to say?

00:55.122 --> 00:55.989
Well, if I'm allowed
to say anything, then...

00:56.023 --> 00:58.692
- Shh!
- Manure Association of America

00:58.725 --> 01:00.661
is proud to present...

01:00.694 --> 01:04.096
Vice President Frederick Bellacourt!

What are you doing?

01:50.410 --> 01:51.645
Freddy... no!

01:51.678 --> 01:53.447
No, no!

01:53.480 --> 01:55.282
Oh, holy Moses, no.

01:55.315 --> 01:56.850
No.

01:56.884 --> 01:58.185
Frederick,

01:58.218 --> 02:01.288
put down the horse shit.

02:02.322 --> 02:03.490
Put it back, put it back!

02:17.671 --> 02:19.439
See? I didn't say a word.

when I show him the ring

02:39.660 --> 02:41.361
he left inside me at the ball.

02:41.395 --> 02:42.496
What is this I'm hearing about

02:42.529 --> 02:43.964
you desecrating our flag?

02:43.997 --> 02:46.500
Am I gonna have to cut
my hunting trip short?!

02:46.533 --> 02:49.837
I'm one grizzly cub shy
of killing an entire family!

02:49.870 --> 02:52.706
- Oh, just leave the one.
- You are about to destroy

02:52.739 --> 02:54.942
everything I've worked so hard for!

02:54.975 --> 02:57.344
I am terrified at
what you're capable of.

02:57.377 --> 02:59.313
Oh, well, there's no reason
to be scared.

02:59.346 --> 03:00.848
It's not dark out...

03:00.881 --> 03:02.449
yet.

03:02.482 --> 03:05.652
Uh, bye, Mr. Rosenfeld!

03:05.686 --> 03:06.920
- Frederick?
- Yes.

03:06.954 --> 03:08.689
- I have something to tell you.
- Me too.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.457
You know the symbol of America?

03:10.490 --> 03:12.392
Well, I set it on fire and covered it

03:12.426 --> 03:13.861
in a steaming pile of horse shit,

03:13.894 --> 03:15.629
and now everybody's talking about me.

03:15.662 --> 03:17.998
Frederick, what I have to say
is important.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.466
Do you remember how we met

03:19.499 --> 03:20.767
our soul mates at the masquerade ball?

03:20.801 --> 03:23.270
Yes, and being jilted
by my mystery soul mate

03:23.303 --> 03:25.906
is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

03:25.939 --> 03:27.007
What do you mean?

03:27.040 --> 03:28.876
Well, now that I'm done with love

03:28.909 --> 03:31.011
and focused on my career,
there's a pretty picture of me

03:31.044 --> 03:33.714
in every newspaper, with a caption

03:33.747 --> 03:35.716
that says something
about a national joke.

03:35.749 --> 03:36.717
Oh.

03:36.750 --> 03:37.784
So, Beatrice,

03:37.818 --> 03:40.420
what was it you wanted to tell me?

03:40.454 --> 03:42.556
I, um...

03:57.371 --> 03:59.640
That's... that's all I had to say.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.275
- Hmm.
- "I, um."

04:01.308 --> 04:02.476
Oh, dear God. Well, thank you

04:02.509 --> 04:04.478
- for letting me know.
- You're welcome.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.620
It's been two weeks,

04:13.654 --> 04:15.489
and no matter how many
loads of laundry I do

04:15.522 --> 04:17.624
or loads of Kerrtrussel I take,

04:17.658 --> 04:20.327
I just can't seem to remember who I am.

04:24.998 --> 04:26.567
God...

04:26.600 --> 04:28.836
Ah, forgot me gun again!

04:28.869 --> 04:30.971
I'll tell you what,
I'd forget me belt too.

04:31.004 --> 04:34.575
Great green goblins, what is this mess?!

04:34.608 --> 04:35.742
I don't know what I'm doing.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.544
None of this feels right!

04:37.578 --> 04:40.447
I'm not good at cooking
and cleaning and...

04:40.480 --> 04:41.982
Rubbing peat oil

04:42.015 --> 04:43.817
on your aching feet.

04:43.851 --> 04:46.053
Oh, Garbagella.

04:46.086 --> 04:47.788
I love the way you rub my feet.

04:47.821 --> 04:49.857
I'm sorry about all the blisters.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.959
Policeman shoes aren't good for much

04:51.992 --> 04:54.361
but kicking hobos and stomping tramps.

04:55.996 --> 04:58.599
I wish I could remember who I was.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.801

06:05.999 --> 06:08.068
What are these telegrams
you keep sending out

06:08.101 --> 06:11.004
- at all hours?
- Those are my musings.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.574
"Make America great for the first time."

06:13.607 --> 06:15.409
- Mm-hmm.
- "My plan for the economy

06:15.442 --> 06:16.643
is that I am rich."

06:16.677 --> 06:18.679
"I declare Civil War II"?

06:18.712 --> 06:20.080
What do these even mean?

06:20.113 --> 06:21.882
Well, I guess there already was one,

06:21.915 --> 06:23.617
so it has to be a sequel.

06:23.650 --> 06:25.619
That never is good, but what can you do?

06:25.652 --> 06:26.653
Half the country is furious,

06:26.687 --> 06:28.589
but the other half...

06:28.622 --> 06:31.058
loves you!
I like the sound of that half.

06:31.091 --> 06:33.627
I thought you'd have to wait
until 1908 to run,

06:33.660 --> 06:35.562
but I think you could
beat Roosevelt now.

06:35.596 --> 06:36.964
Freddy!

06:36.997 --> 06:39.833
Do you want to be president?

06:39.867 --> 06:41.535
- Do I have to?
- Well...

06:41.568 --> 06:43.837
do you want more applause
and portraits painted?

06:43.871 --> 06:45.138
- Yes!
- Then I'll make

06:45.172 --> 06:46.540
the announcement tomorrow morning.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.942
We have so much hard work

06:48.976 --> 06:50.010
ahead of us!

06:50.043 --> 06:51.712
Work? There's more work?

06:51.745 --> 06:53.614
Nothing but work, work, work ahead of us

06:53.647 --> 06:54.815
until the minute you take office!

06:54.848 --> 06:55.616
I can't possibly work any harder

06:55.649 --> 06:57.217
than I already am.

06:57.251 --> 06:59.553
I've been standing here
for an hour, at least.

06:59.586 --> 07:00.821
At least five minutes.

07:00.854 --> 07:02.623
Five, ten minutes.

07:07.127 --> 07:08.962
Blanche! You're back.

07:08.996 --> 07:11.598
Here, take this... shit-maker from me.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.835
I'd say he missed you,

07:14.868 --> 07:16.003
but I doubt he knows who you are.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.905
Back to work, back to work!

07:17.938 --> 07:19.006
Stop feeling.

07:20.707 --> 07:22.176
Hi. Murray.

07:22.209 --> 07:23.177
He's alive.

07:23.210 --> 07:25.612
My baby is alive!

07:25.646 --> 07:26.914
For the first time in my life,

07:26.947 --> 07:28.148
I can honestly say I'm glad

07:28.182 --> 07:30.751
I didn't die in my sleep last night!

07:34.172 --> 07:35.640
Now that Lillian's gone,

07:35.674 --> 07:38.109
Mother fired me,
and Frederick wants to be alone,

07:38.143 --> 07:40.946
there is no one in the world
who loves me.

07:40.979 --> 07:42.414
So, I'm going to get advice

07:42.447 --> 07:43.849
from the least-loved person I know.

07:45.417 --> 07:47.152
Hostess?

07:47.185 --> 07:48.420
Hon-ton?

07:49.621 --> 07:50.655
Becky?

07:52.724 --> 07:54.793
- Hortense.
- Yes.

07:54.826 --> 07:56.094
Can I ask you some advice?

07:56.127 --> 07:58.897
No, I do not know
the best way to kill myself,

07:58.930 --> 08:00.832
even though I must
think about it day and night.

08:00.866 --> 08:02.567
No, it's something else this time.

08:03.635 --> 08:04.903
Oh, okay.

08:04.936 --> 08:06.938
So, people don't like you, right?

08:06.972 --> 08:10.475
So, it is not something else, but, yes.

08:10.509 --> 08:11.943
I am a smart, independent woman,

08:11.977 --> 08:13.879
so I am generally disliked. What of it?

08:13.912 --> 08:16.448
Well, I lost the love of my life,

08:16.481 --> 08:18.116
and the man who I thought
was the future love of my life,

08:18.149 --> 08:19.918
because the man who I thought
was the future love of my life

08:19.951 --> 08:21.853
was the same man as the love of my life.

08:21.887 --> 08:23.722
But you already know all that.

08:23.755 --> 08:24.856
Yes, and how can I help you?

08:24.890 --> 08:27.526
Now that no one loves me...

08:27.559 --> 08:29.160
what am I supposed to do?

08:31.196 --> 08:32.664
Oh.

08:32.697 --> 08:36.034
Being unloved can be
quite liberating, actually.

08:36.067 --> 08:39.037
With nobody to care about but yourself,

08:39.070 --> 08:42.039
you can spend your time
any way you want.

08:42.073 --> 08:43.741
I never thought about it before.

08:43.775 --> 08:45.944
I've always just done what
Lillian, or Frederick,

08:45.977 --> 08:48.813
or the horse that told me
to murder his family wanted.

08:52.484 --> 08:54.085
Well...

08:54.119 --> 08:57.622
now is your chance to do what you want.

08:57.656 --> 09:00.192
- Oh!
- Travel, get a hobby.

09:00.225 --> 09:02.727
Read a book.

09:02.761 --> 09:04.763
Well, and learn the alphabet first.

09:04.796 --> 09:07.866
Oh, so many options.

09:07.899 --> 09:09.968
Would you...

09:10.001 --> 09:12.604
want to do something together?

09:14.606 --> 09:16.842
Just us...

09:16.875 --> 09:18.844
lonely gals?

09:20.879 --> 09:22.547
Remember how I said
that people don't like you?

09:22.581 --> 09:24.049
Oh, yes.

09:24.082 --> 09:26.117
Well, I'm one of those people.

09:26.151 --> 09:27.752
But thank you.

09:31.022 --> 09:32.858
When Frederick's in charge,
we're finally going to

09:32.891 --> 09:35.093
get rid of all those poor people.

09:35.126 --> 09:37.229
Garfield, we are those poor people.

09:37.262 --> 09:40.198
No, if he's in charge,
we're all going to die.

09:40.232 --> 09:41.933
We're all going to die!

09:41.967 --> 09:42.934
Oh, it won't be that bad.

09:42.968 --> 09:44.502
Yes, our wages will be cut,

09:44.536 --> 09:46.738
our rights will be
systematically dismantled,

09:46.771 --> 09:48.573
and the doctor will be fired,

09:48.607 --> 09:50.509
causing all of us to die,
but that's as it should be.

09:50.542 --> 09:51.510
I agree.

09:51.543 --> 09:52.644
To hell with it.

09:52.677 --> 09:54.679
Let it all burn to the ground.

09:54.713 --> 09:56.882
No! That man is dangerous.

09:56.915 --> 09:58.750
He says he wants a Civil War II.

09:58.783 --> 10:00.585
Why are you so scared of war?

10:00.619 --> 10:02.954
It's a man's most natural state,
you idiot.

10:02.988 --> 10:04.155
You can't think of a reason

10:04.189 --> 10:05.690
I wouldn't want another civil war?

10:05.724 --> 10:06.858
We're all gonna die!

10:06.892 --> 10:08.260
Oh, stop your hysterics, woman.

10:08.293 --> 10:10.562
Frederick doesn't mean
the things he says.

10:10.595 --> 10:12.230
- That's why I like him.
- Oh, I think he means

10:12.264 --> 10:14.299
exactly what he says,
and that's why I like him.

10:14.332 --> 10:16.868
Well, either way,
that idiot is never actually

10:16.902 --> 10:19.137
going to be in charge.
He thinks rain is a hoax

10:19.170 --> 10:21.006
created by the umbrella industry.

10:21.039 --> 10:23.074
Oh, he's going to build
a roof over America,

10:23.108 --> 10:24.976
and then we'll never get wet again!

10:25.010 --> 10:26.611
Well, it doesn't matter anyway,

10:26.645 --> 10:28.914
because we're already dead,
and none of you can see it!

10:28.947 --> 10:30.615
All right, all right!

10:30.649 --> 10:33.118
This is why servants should
never discuss politics,

10:33.151 --> 10:35.220
religion, or contemporary
American painting.

10:35.253 --> 10:37.289
Whistler is overrated.

10:37.322 --> 10:40.091
Whistler is a master of color and light,

10:40.125 --> 10:41.726
and you know it! Whistler?

10:41.760 --> 10:43.795
Whistler?! Whistler sucks.

10:43.828 --> 10:46.965
John Singer Sargent...
now that is a real painter!

10:46.998 --> 10:49.701
Sargent's landscapes
are middling at best,

10:49.734 --> 10:50.802
you repulsive troll.

10:50.835 --> 10:51.970
You wanna tell me

10:52.003 --> 10:53.004
that Whistler's "Mother"
is a good piece?

10:53.038 --> 10:54.639
Come on! Well, it is!

10:54.673 --> 10:56.575
It's an old lady sitting
around, doing nothing!

10:56.608 --> 10:58.343
- No, no!
- When I see subjects,

10:58.376 --> 10:59.845
I want them to be doing something,

10:59.878 --> 11:01.680
or at least be posing!

11:01.713 --> 11:04.749
♪ I'm trying to get that money ♪

11:32.244 --> 11:33.211
Now that I'm done with Frederick,

11:33.245 --> 11:35.847
I'm off to the place
where rich people go

11:35.881 --> 11:37.682
when they're completely out of options.

11:44.222 --> 11:45.657
♪ Money don't sleep ♪

11:45.690 --> 11:47.325
♪ Got a penny by the minute ♪

11:49.427 --> 11:51.162
Okay!

11:51.196 --> 11:53.865
- O'Malley, here's for you.
- Ah, thank you.

11:53.899 --> 11:55.300
O'Shaugnessy.

11:55.333 --> 11:56.768
- Thank you, dearie.
- Ain't cheating this time.

11:56.801 --> 11:58.336
- Okay.
- Muah!

11:58.370 --> 12:00.405
Oh, thank you, sweetie.

12:00.438 --> 12:02.340
O'Connor, you keep
looking at me like that,

12:02.374 --> 12:04.309
I'm gonna have to
make you my husband, too.

12:08.180 --> 12:09.881
Who am I kidding? You can have a pat.

12:09.915 --> 12:11.016
Ah, there you go, then!

12:11.049 --> 12:12.817
Okay!

12:12.851 --> 12:15.320
Okay.

12:17.389 --> 12:19.858
What kind of sick game
are you playing here,

12:19.891 --> 12:22.294
- Kerrtrussel?
- I have no idea

12:22.327 --> 12:23.862
- what you're talking about.
- What are you doing

12:23.895 --> 12:25.263
with Lillian Bellacourt?

12:25.297 --> 12:27.799
Shh! Hush up.

12:27.832 --> 12:30.735
You know how sad I've been
since my Petunia died.

12:30.769 --> 12:32.137
Petunia was your cat.

12:32.170 --> 12:34.906
And she made the house into a home!

12:34.940 --> 12:36.274
Look, I've got no problem
with you tricking a woman

12:36.308 --> 12:38.143
with amnesia into
believing she's your wife.

12:38.176 --> 12:39.911
I mean, we've all done it.

12:39.945 --> 12:42.981
The problem that I have
is that it's her.

12:43.014 --> 12:44.883
She's a damn heiress, man.

12:44.916 --> 12:46.985
And when her family finds out
about this,

12:47.018 --> 12:48.253
you'll be in the clink.

12:48.286 --> 12:49.821
And it'll be worth it!

12:49.855 --> 12:51.857
She's the greatest woman
I've ever known or abducted.

12:53.325 --> 12:55.827
Food, food!

12:57.395 --> 13:00.031
- Of course, some food.
- Pretzels for you, honey.

13:00.065 --> 13:02.200
My favorite German dish!

13:04.436 --> 13:05.370
I fold.

13:10.867 --> 13:12.469
Would you like me to pack this?

13:12.502 --> 13:13.837
You have 12 other birdcages.

13:13.870 --> 13:15.539
Blanche, I want to make
a good impression.

13:17.407 --> 13:19.376
Beatrice, can I ask your advice?

13:19.409 --> 13:20.811
Celery is making me be president,

13:20.844 --> 13:22.512
but it sounds really hard.

13:22.546 --> 13:24.715
No! For the love of America, no!

13:26.216 --> 13:27.751
Nothing.

13:27.784 --> 13:30.153
I thought you were dead.

13:30.187 --> 13:31.321
No, I'm still holding on.

13:31.355 --> 13:32.789
Oh! Huh.

13:34.825 --> 13:36.460
Well, if I'm president,
I won't be able to focus

13:36.493 --> 13:38.762
on what really matters, like...

13:38.795 --> 13:41.431
what's for dessert, or...
or teaching myself how to fly.

13:41.465 --> 13:42.699
This is as far as I've gotten.

13:44.534 --> 13:46.470
Hmm. You should focus on that.

13:46.503 --> 13:48.538
- You're so close.
- Thank you.

13:48.572 --> 13:49.906
Blanche, don't forget to pack my Bible.

13:49.940 --> 13:51.575
- I want to look smart.
- Yes.

13:51.608 --> 13:53.377
- Are you going somewhere?
- I'm going to college.

13:54.211 --> 13:55.379
Ew.

13:55.412 --> 13:56.513
Gross. When?

13:56.546 --> 13:58.815
I don't know. Tomorrow?

13:58.849 --> 14:01.218
I'm... not sure how college works.

14:01.251 --> 14:02.519
Well, if you're gone,

14:02.552 --> 14:04.421
then I won't have anyone to play with.

14:04.454 --> 14:07.924
So, I... might as well be president.

14:07.958 --> 14:09.459
Will you at least stay for the speech

14:09.493 --> 14:11.495
where I tell everyone
I'm going to ruin the world?

14:11.528 --> 14:13.497
Or run the world? What's the..

14:13.530 --> 14:15.565
Sounds boring, but... all right.

14:16.600 --> 14:18.769
Thank you.

14:18.802 --> 14:20.537
- You found your ring.
- Oh, yes.

14:20.570 --> 14:21.738
Turns out I left it on my desk,

14:21.772 --> 14:23.273
and not in the soggy velvet

14:23.307 --> 14:25.375
of the mystery woman of my dreams.

14:25.409 --> 14:27.878
Well, all right.

14:27.911 --> 14:31.615
I guess I'm... off to be president.

14:31.648 --> 14:34.318
Unless anybody wants to stop me.

14:41.358 --> 14:42.492
- Did you say something?
- Nothing.

14:42.526 --> 14:43.760
- You didn't say anything?
- No.

14:43.794 --> 14:44.761
Okay.

14:44.795 --> 14:46.763
Uh...

14:46.797 --> 14:48.532
Well... it's a lot of power.

14:48.565 --> 14:50.000
A lot of responsibility.

14:50.033 --> 14:51.535
That I don't have to do...

14:51.568 --> 14:54.004
if anyone says literally anything.

14:54.037 --> 14:55.906
Miss Beatrice,
perhaps you should stop him.

14:55.939 --> 14:59.242
No, I think it's better this way.

14:59.276 --> 15:00.377
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

15:18.495 --> 15:20.731
Oh! Sadly, it's back to work

15:20.764 --> 15:22.933
- for me, dearie.
- No, you're working?

15:22.966 --> 15:25.002
I was gonna make wood biscuits
for lunch.

15:25.035 --> 15:26.670
Oh, that sounds too delicious,

15:26.703 --> 15:28.405
but I had to pick up an extra shift...

15:28.438 --> 15:30.307
big event for the vice president.

15:30.340 --> 15:31.675
Wait, that sounds familiar.

15:31.708 --> 15:33.043
No, it doesn't!

15:33.076 --> 15:35.879
Politics is boring and for men.

15:35.912 --> 15:37.714
Don't worry your pretty little mind

15:37.748 --> 15:39.416
about that, my little pie.

15:39.449 --> 15:40.751
Kisses forever.

15:40.784 --> 15:41.818
Kisses forever.

15:48.859 --> 15:50.027
Kertrussel!

15:50.060 --> 15:53.964
Kertrussel! You forgot your gun!

15:53.997 --> 15:55.499
Kertrussel!

16:02.706 --> 16:05.475
Dear America, I come to you today

16:05.509 --> 16:07.644
not just as a man,

16:07.678 --> 16:08.845
but as a great man.

16:08.879 --> 16:11.748
And not just as a great man,

16:11.782 --> 16:13.650
but as a president man.

16:22.392 --> 16:23.593
This ring...

16:25.996 --> 16:26.964
Today...

16:26.997 --> 16:28.465
My ring!

16:28.498 --> 16:29.900
Where did it go?

16:30.934 --> 16:33.737
Fre... Fre...

16:35.405 --> 16:36.940
Hey!

16:36.974 --> 16:38.709
I used to have a ring just like that!

16:39.776 --> 16:40.877
It was you.

16:42.713 --> 16:43.480
You are my beloved.

16:43.513 --> 16:44.681
Freddy!

16:44.715 --> 16:46.416
Go on with the announcement.

16:46.450 --> 16:47.918
Frederick, Frederick!

16:50.621 --> 16:53.557
Thank you, thank you, but...

16:53.590 --> 16:55.926
I don't need your love.

16:55.959 --> 16:58.929
In fact, I'm a little disgusted by it.

16:58.962 --> 17:00.497
There's only one person

17:00.530 --> 17:01.898
who will always love me no matter what.

17:03.834 --> 17:05.102
And it's my sister, Beatrice.

17:08.505 --> 17:10.607
You people only love me
because I burned the flag

17:10.641 --> 17:12.376
and destabilized our democracy,

17:12.409 --> 17:14.144
but Beatrice doesn't care
about that stuff.

17:14.176 --> 17:17.146
Beatrice just cares about me,
and how I feel,

17:17.180 --> 17:19.148
and if my hair looks pretty.

17:19.182 --> 17:21.451
- It does look pretty.
- Thank you, Beatrice.

17:21.484 --> 17:23.887
I'm not qualified for president.

17:23.920 --> 17:24.988
I don't even know if it's pronounced

17:25.021 --> 17:26.957
the "U-S" or the "us."

17:26.990 --> 17:29.593
And frankly, I don't care.

17:29.626 --> 17:31.962
Because I don't care about this country.

17:31.995 --> 17:33.830
And I don't care about any of you.

17:33.864 --> 17:36.967
All I care about is Beatrice.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.669
- Oh, Frederick.
- Oh, Beatrice.

17:51.782 --> 17:53.617
Oh, goodness me.

18:03.342 --> 18:05.244
Kertrussel!

18:05.277 --> 18:06.645
Kertrussel.

18:06.679 --> 18:08.714
You forgot your gun again, sweetheart.

18:08.747 --> 18:11.217
I told you to not leave
the house, darling.

18:11.250 --> 18:12.351
Oh, hi, Lillian!

18:12.384 --> 18:13.619
Hi, Beatrice.

18:17.623 --> 18:19.492
Beatrice...

18:19.525 --> 18:21.427
I literally have
no behavioral standards at all.

18:21.460 --> 18:24.196
I can make anyone cry
in under 60 seconds.

18:24.230 --> 18:25.664
I get to marry the prince! I'm Lillian!

18:25.698 --> 18:28.100
Imagine my face on a milk jar...

18:28.133 --> 18:29.502
or an oat sack.

18:29.535 --> 18:31.070
I can't be better than you at anything?

18:31.103 --> 18:32.271
That's the dynamic

18:32.304 --> 18:33.472
that's been working for us so far!

18:33.506 --> 18:35.174
Stop trying to make this all about you!

18:35.207 --> 18:36.375
You're only pretty in Massachusetts!

18:36.408 --> 18:38.344
I'm a star,

18:38.377 --> 18:39.445
and you're not.

18:41.280 --> 18:43.449
I'm supposed to be the famous one.

18:43.482 --> 18:45.684
What's the point of living
when Beatrice is famous

18:45.718 --> 18:47.553
and I'm not? I'm going to miss

18:47.586 --> 18:49.255
our custom-made suicide outfits.

18:54.627 --> 18:56.495
This is all your fault!

18:57.530 --> 18:59.398
Okay, Garbagella,

18:59.431 --> 19:00.833
why don't you just go ahead
and give me the gun.

19:00.866 --> 19:03.102
My name's not Garbagella!

19:03.135 --> 19:05.404
It's Lillian Bellacourt!

19:05.437 --> 19:07.540
You held me hostage.

19:07.573 --> 19:11.143
I slept... on cotton!

19:11.177 --> 19:12.778
- Ew.
- I was happy.

19:12.812 --> 19:14.280
I had it all.

19:14.313 --> 19:16.649
And then you got famous!

19:16.682 --> 19:18.818
You ruined my life.

19:18.851 --> 19:21.320
No, no, Lillian.
I'm sorry I stole your dream.

19:21.353 --> 19:23.589
I didn't mean to. And you know what?

19:23.622 --> 19:25.758
Being famous, it's really hard.

19:25.791 --> 19:27.693
And if you want to, you can have it.

19:27.726 --> 19:29.094
Wait, you're not just
saying that because

19:29.128 --> 19:30.296
I'm holding a loaded weapon, are you?

19:30.329 --> 19:32.264
Well, I am, but also, no.

19:32.298 --> 19:34.667
I don't want it anymore,
and you need it more than I do.

19:34.700 --> 19:37.670
Lillian, I am giving you my fame.

19:37.703 --> 19:39.405
Oh, Beatrice.

19:39.438 --> 19:41.407
That's all I ever wanted, really...

19:41.440 --> 19:43.375
was to be more famous than you.

19:43.409 --> 19:45.177
Well, to be more famous
than anyone, really.

19:46.378 --> 19:47.713
Look, it's President Roosevelt!

19:47.746 --> 19:49.815
I go hunting for one fortnight,

19:49.849 --> 19:52.551
and you try to usurp me!

19:55.221 --> 19:56.822
Drop the gun!

19:59.892 --> 20:02.328
Beatrice! No!

20:02.361 --> 20:05.431
Frederick, no!

20:07.299 --> 20:10.536
I'm finally flying!

20:26.452 --> 20:28.154
I think he's dead!

20:30.689 --> 20:33.726
Garbagella, you're under arrest.

20:33.759 --> 20:36.529
Anything you say or do

20:36.562 --> 20:38.631
can be held... I love you so much!

20:38.664 --> 20:40.833
Lillian! You shot the president!

20:40.866 --> 20:42.468
Smile!

20:42.501 --> 20:44.336
It turns out,
we both got what we wanted.

20:44.370 --> 20:45.738
I'm finally famous!

20:45.771 --> 20:47.506
All right, off to the pokey, now!

20:49.241 --> 20:51.377
And I get to keep my brother.

20:53.779 --> 20:56.248
I guess Freddy's going
to be president after all.
