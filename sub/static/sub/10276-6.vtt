( Minimus whinnies )

01:04.731 --> 01:06.732
We got this, Minimus!

01:06.734 --> 01:09.068
( whinnying )

01:09.070 --> 01:11.637
Lovely day
for a ride, Sofia!

01:11.639 --> 01:13.072
Mind if I join you?

01:13.074 --> 01:14.673
Aunt Tilly!

01:14.675 --> 01:16.108
( horses whinnying )
Whoa! What's the rush?

01:16.110 --> 01:18.177
We're racing,
but that's okay.

01:18.179 --> 01:19.344
I'll get them next time.

01:19.346 --> 01:22.014
( whinnying )

01:23.249 --> 01:25.117
So how long
are you staying?

01:25.119 --> 01:26.785
Oh, just long enough.

01:26.787 --> 01:29.621
Tell me, Sofia,
have you finished
the book I gave you?

01:29.623 --> 01:31.056
I just finished chapter 12.

01:31.058 --> 01:32.658
I never knew how
many kings and queens

01:32.660 --> 01:34.226
there were in Enchancia.

01:34.228 --> 01:36.195
Oh, there's a lot
of history in these walls.

01:36.197 --> 01:38.597
Wait till you get
to chapter 17.

01:38.599 --> 01:39.698
That's my favorite.

01:39.700 --> 01:40.866
But you
should keep reading,

01:40.868 --> 01:44.002
because knowledge
is the key to everything.

01:51.044 --> 01:54.279
"Chapter 17,
Behind the Walls."

01:55.849 --> 01:58.884
( gasps ) What's this?

01:58.886 --> 02:00.953
Whoa!

02:10.897 --> 02:12.664
Hey!
Whatcha doin', Sof?

02:12.666 --> 02:14.733
Clover! I found this book
inside my book!

02:14.735 --> 02:17.669
Did you know there are
secret passageways
in the castle?

02:17.671 --> 02:20.172
Hello? How do you think
I get in here?

02:20.174 --> 02:21.707
Huh?

02:21.709 --> 02:23.709
Ta-da!

02:25.645 --> 02:26.712
Huh.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.689
( Amulet tinkling )

02:37.691 --> 02:40.058
Huh.

02:40.060 --> 02:43.162
My amulet's
never turned blue before.

02:47.133 --> 02:48.800
I want to look
around in there.

02:48.802 --> 02:50.669
Too bad you're not
rabbit-sized.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.171
But I could be.

02:52.173 --> 02:54.840
My amulet
gave me the power
to shrink, remember?

02:56.676 --> 02:59.978
I wish to be small.

02:59.980 --> 03:02.681
Are you sure you wanna
poke around in there?

03:02.683 --> 03:05.851
Some of those passageways go
all the way under the castle.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.352
Sounds like fun.

03:07.354 --> 03:10.222
Not as much fun as staying
up here and taking a nap.

03:10.224 --> 03:11.423
I'll be back soon.

03:19.165 --> 03:21.967
I wish to be big again.

05:32.532 --> 05:35.000
( whooshing )

How do I get
in without a key?

06:23.182 --> 06:25.951
( straining )

06:25.953 --> 06:28.186
How do I get in?

06:28.188 --> 06:31.957
Hmm. Maybe there's something
in the book about it.

06:42.001 --> 06:43.435
Hmm.

06:43.437 --> 06:47.906
Knowledge is the key
to everything.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.007
Unh.

07:05.958 --> 07:07.492
Unh.

07:25.311 --> 07:27.946
Wow!
Look at all these books.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.714
( bell clanging )
Huh?

07:33.119 --> 07:35.020
( bell clanging )

07:35.022 --> 07:37.055
Hmm.

07:39.392 --> 07:41.626

07:51.003 --> 07:52.637
Wow.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.641
( bell clangs )

07:56.643 --> 07:58.076
Hmm?

08:02.315 --> 08:03.715
My castle?

08:09.489 --> 08:11.523
Wh--Where am I?

08:11.525 --> 08:13.124
The secret library.

08:13.126 --> 08:15.727
Aunt Tilly?
What are you doing here?

08:15.729 --> 08:17.529
How did
you find this place?

08:17.531 --> 08:19.164
The same way
as you, dear,

08:19.166 --> 08:21.299
although I did
it 30 years ago.

08:21.301 --> 08:22.634
You've been here before?

08:22.636 --> 08:24.569
Many times.
But this is the visit

08:24.571 --> 08:26.404
I've been looking
forward to the most.

08:26.406 --> 08:29.107
Now, come along,
we've much to do.
Much to do.

08:29.109 --> 08:31.009
We have to see if you
have what it takes

08:31.011 --> 08:33.011
to be
the next "storykeeper."

08:33.013 --> 08:34.079
Storykeeper?

08:34.081 --> 08:36.114
See all those books
on the walls?

08:36.116 --> 08:37.382
Uh-huh.

08:37.384 --> 08:39.384
Well, most of them
don't have endings yet.

08:39.386 --> 08:42.521
It's been my job to go out and
find whoever the book is about

08:42.523 --> 08:44.689
and help them finish
their story.

08:44.691 --> 08:48.193
And now I'm hoping,
that job will be yours.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.195
Why me?

08:50.197 --> 08:52.531
The answer is
right there around
your neck, Sofia.

08:52.533 --> 08:54.466
The Amulet of Avalor
led you here,

08:54.468 --> 08:57.168
just like it led me here
when I wore it.

08:57.170 --> 08:59.070
You wore the amulet?

08:59.072 --> 09:02.541
Yes, I did
when I was a young princess.

09:02.543 --> 09:06.111
The amulet is how I knew you
could be the next storykeeper.

09:06.113 --> 09:08.179
That and passing
all my little tests.

09:08.181 --> 09:11.216
Which is why I gave you
the key to the library.

09:11.218 --> 09:12.450
Oh...

09:12.452 --> 09:15.554
You should really
sit down now.

09:15.556 --> 09:17.355
( rumbling )

09:20.092 --> 09:21.526
What's happening?

09:21.528 --> 09:23.128
Oh, this is exciting.

09:23.130 --> 09:25.463
The library is choosing
your first story.

09:29.602 --> 09:32.170
( whooshing )

09:38.244 --> 09:39.177
Here it comes now.

09:42.114 --> 09:45.517
Well, what are you
waiting for? Open it.

09:48.454 --> 09:51.423
<i> "The Tale</i>
<i> of Wildwing Valley."</i>

09:51.425 --> 09:53.291
Mmm. Interesting.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.272
NARRATOR:
<i> Once upon a pasture,</i>

10:07.274 --> 10:10.475
<i> there was a flying horse</i>
<i> named Mazzimo,</i>

10:10.477 --> 10:12.877
<i> who lived with his family</i>
<i> at a royal stable.</i>

10:12.879 --> 10:16.147
<i> Even though he served</i>
<i> a kind and noble king,</i>

10:16.149 --> 10:18.717
<i> Mazzimo yearned to be wild.</i>

10:18.719 --> 10:21.486
<i> One night,</i>
<i>a visiting horse told Mazzimo</i>

10:21.488 --> 10:25.457
<i> about Wildwing Valley,</i>
<i> a magically hidden land</i>

10:25.459 --> 10:28.526
<i> where enchanted creatures</i>
<i> roam free.</i>

10:28.528 --> 10:31.796
<i> Mazzimo knew he had</i>
<i> to find this valley.</i>

10:31.798 --> 10:34.699
<i> So he said goodbye to his</i>
<i>father, mother, and brother,</i>

10:34.701 --> 10:36.434
<i> who liked living at the castle</i>

10:36.436 --> 10:38.703
<i> and didn't understand</i>
<i> why he was leaving.</i>

10:38.705 --> 10:41.306
<i> They were very sad</i>
<i> to see him go.</i>

10:41.308 --> 10:43.708
That's Minimus!
Mazzimo is his brother?!

10:43.710 --> 10:45.744
The things you learn
from books.

10:45.746 --> 10:49.247
<i> Mazzimo flew off</i>
<i>in search of Wildwing Valley.</i>

10:49.249 --> 10:53.385
<i> he was captured</i>
<i> by the knights of Borrea.</i>

10:53.387 --> 10:56.254
<i> Mazzimo was taken to</i>
<i>the castle of Prince Roderick,</i>

10:56.256 --> 11:00.225
<i> where he has been held</i>
<i>against his will to this day.</i>

11:02.161 --> 11:03.595
That's awful.

11:03.597 --> 11:06.865
Unless you give the story
a better ending.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.833
I'm supposed
to save Mazzimo?

11:08.835 --> 11:11.269
And help him find
Wildwing Valley.

11:11.271 --> 11:13.171
I'm not sure
I can do this.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.640
I know. Being storykeeper
is not easy.

11:15.642 --> 11:17.442
But you can do it, Sofia,

11:17.444 --> 11:19.210
or you wouldn't be here.

11:19.212 --> 11:21.479
So the real question isn't
"can you do it?"

11:21.481 --> 11:22.914
It's "will you do it?"

11:29.355 --> 11:31.256
I will.

11:31.258 --> 11:32.490
Whiz bang!

11:32.492 --> 11:34.359
But I don't even know
where to start.

11:34.361 --> 11:37.495
You can start by putting on
something more adventurous.

11:37.497 --> 11:39.964
That's not what I meant.

11:39.966 --> 11:41.800
Mmm, how about this?

11:41.802 --> 11:43.968
I'll come with you
this one time.

11:43.970 --> 11:45.437
Thanks.

11:47.873 --> 11:49.307
Minimus!

11:49.309 --> 11:50.675
What's up, Sofia?

11:50.677 --> 11:52.377
Come on. We're going
to save your brother.

11:52.379 --> 11:53.978
Mazzimo's in trouble?!

11:53.980 --> 11:55.613
Oh! Well, then
we have to help him!

11:55.615 --> 11:57.549
What are we waiting for?
Let's go!

11:58.684 --> 12:00.285
Wait, where are we going?

12:00.287 --> 12:02.854
And how did you know
I have a brother?

12:02.856 --> 12:04.255
I'll tell you
on the way!

12:04.257 --> 12:06.257
Are you talking
to your horse, Sofia?

12:06.259 --> 12:09.327
Oh. The amulet gave me
the power to talk to animals.

12:09.329 --> 12:11.229
I should've known.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.431
The amulet gave me all sorts
of powers when I wore it.

12:13.433 --> 12:16.534
Oh, I guess I should introduce
you to my horse, Athena.

12:16.536 --> 12:18.303
Nice to meet you, Athena.

12:18.305 --> 12:20.238
Okay, then, let's
shake a horse feather!

12:20.240 --> 12:21.239
( Minimus whinnies )

12:21.241 --> 12:23.341
SOFIA:
Is Borrea far?

12:23.343 --> 12:24.743
It's only
two kingdoms over,

12:24.745 --> 12:26.244
across
the Strangeway Channel.

12:32.518 --> 12:34.452
( Minimus whinnies )

12:46.766 --> 12:48.500
TILLY:
That's one big stable.

12:48.502 --> 12:50.769
Mazzimo's probably
in there somewhere.

12:50.771 --> 12:54.372
Maybe I should search one end
and you search the other.

12:54.374 --> 12:55.607
Good idea.

13:12.658 --> 13:14.826
( horse whinnies,
kicks door )

13:15.761 --> 13:19.831
( kicking, whinnying )

13:21.467 --> 13:24.836
( whinnying )

13:24.838 --> 13:26.070
Mazzimo?!

13:26.072 --> 13:28.072
Minimus?!

13:28.074 --> 13:30.308
Good to see you, bro!

13:30.310 --> 13:31.609
It's been so long...

13:31.611 --> 13:33.812
since you took off
and left us for no reason!

13:33.814 --> 13:35.446
You didn't
even send a postcard!

13:35.448 --> 13:36.648
Uh, Minimus...

13:36.650 --> 13:38.316
Whoa! I had a reason.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.617
And then we come
here to save you,

13:39.619 --> 13:42.086
and this is, like,
the nicest stable ever.

13:42.088 --> 13:43.788
TEMPEST: That's what
we keep telling him,

13:43.790 --> 13:45.924
but does he listen? No.

13:45.926 --> 13:48.092
We even have heated stalls.

13:48.094 --> 13:49.460
Heated stalls?!

13:49.462 --> 13:50.929
The only way
to heat my stall

13:50.931 --> 13:52.463
is to have a dragon
set it on fire.

13:52.465 --> 13:54.098
Yeah, it's nice in here.

13:54.100 --> 13:56.968
But a cozy cage
is still a cage.

13:56.970 --> 14:00.338
It's not a cage!
It's a royal stable.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.841
And you are lucky
to be here.

14:02.843 --> 14:04.042
I'd rather be free.

14:04.044 --> 14:05.476
Here we go again.

14:05.478 --> 14:06.878
All right, Minimus,

14:06.880 --> 14:08.646
yeah, maybe you'd be
living it up in here.

14:08.648 --> 14:10.715
You don't mind letting people
ride around on your back.

14:10.717 --> 14:12.750
But that's
not how I fly, bro.

14:12.752 --> 14:14.385
Mazzimo gotta roam.

14:14.387 --> 14:16.054
I really don't get you.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.422
I don't get you, either,

14:17.424 --> 14:19.424
but you're my brother,
so I let it slide.

14:19.426 --> 14:20.892
Guys? Maybe we can
talk about this

14:20.894 --> 14:23.027
after we get
out of here, okay?

14:24.363 --> 14:25.997
( straining )

14:25.999 --> 14:28.867
Ah, you found him!

14:28.869 --> 14:30.535
Uh-huh,
but the stall's locked.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.403
RODERICK: Hallo?

14:33.539 --> 14:34.706
Do I know you?

14:34.708 --> 14:36.040
Uh, not yet.

14:36.042 --> 14:38.743
I'm Princess Sofia
of Enchancia.

14:38.745 --> 14:39.878
And this
is my Aunt Tilly.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.846
Good afternoon.

14:41.848 --> 14:43.815
I didn't know we were
expecting visitors
today, Gavin.

14:43.817 --> 14:45.416
We weren't, sire.

14:45.418 --> 14:47.986
Ah, well, guests
are always welcome,

14:47.988 --> 14:50.521
although they
usually knock first.

14:50.523 --> 14:53.124
I am Prince Roderick.

14:53.126 --> 14:56.060
You know, I was
just about to take
my horse for a spin,

14:56.062 --> 14:57.896
if you
care to join me.

14:57.898 --> 14:59.530
He hasn't quite
taken to me yet,

14:59.532 --> 15:00.798
but I'm sure
he'll come around.

15:00.800 --> 15:03.167
No way I'm letting
that guy ride me.

15:03.169 --> 15:05.136
Um...Prince Roderick?

15:05.138 --> 15:06.604
That's why we're here.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.506
Mazzimo wants to be free.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.975
Mazzimo? You mean,
Thundercloud here?

15:10.977 --> 15:12.944
Can you believe that name?

15:12.946 --> 15:14.445
Your knights
captured him,

15:14.447 --> 15:15.813
but he doesn't want
to be here.

15:15.815 --> 15:17.582
Of course he does.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.584
This is the best stable
in the world.

15:19.586 --> 15:22.453
That may be true,
but he's not your horse.

15:22.455 --> 15:24.422
I beg to differ.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.457
We found him flying
loose in my kingdom
three months ago.

15:26.459 --> 15:28.593
No rider, no markings.

15:28.595 --> 15:31.729
I believe the expression
is "finders keepers."

15:31.731 --> 15:33.064
So there you have it.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.565
Now, how about we
all go for a ride

15:34.567 --> 15:36.601
and have
a jolly time? Gavin?

15:36.603 --> 15:37.468
Right, sire.

15:37.470 --> 15:38.636
( lock clinks )
Mmm!

15:40.906 --> 15:42.440
Fly for it, Mazzimo!

15:42.442 --> 15:43.574
( whinnying )

15:43.576 --> 15:45.810
Go, go, go!

15:45.812 --> 15:47.078
Watch your step.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.713
( grunting )

15:48.715 --> 15:50.915
SOFIA: Come on, Aunt Tilly!
Let's go!

15:50.917 --> 15:53.484
( Minimus whinnying )

15:53.486 --> 15:55.720
( whinnying )

15:55.722 --> 15:58.056
This won't do at all.

15:58.058 --> 16:01.559
I suppose we'll have
to hunt them down
and get my horse back.

16:01.561 --> 16:03.761
Right.
Let's saddle up, Gavin.

16:03.763 --> 16:05.163
( whinnying )

16:05.165 --> 16:08.666
Whoo-hoo! Oh, I owe
you guys big time!

16:08.668 --> 16:10.868
Hey, you wanna come
to Wildwing Valley
with me?

16:10.870 --> 16:12.503
It's just
past those gorges.

16:12.505 --> 16:14.205
Wherever we go,
we'd better hurry,

16:14.207 --> 16:15.540
because they're chasing us!

16:15.542 --> 16:16.641
RODERICK:
Ha ha ha ha!

16:16.643 --> 16:18.543
A-hunting we will go,
Gavin!

16:18.545 --> 16:20.478
We should probably try
to get them off our trail.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.847
Let's try to lose them
in the gorges. C'mon!

16:22.849 --> 16:25.483
( whinnying )

16:27.486 --> 16:29.854
Wow, you are faster
than you used to be!

16:29.856 --> 16:31.122
You ever think
about racing?

16:31.124 --> 16:32.490
Now that you mention it,
you know,

16:32.492 --> 16:34.659
we've actually
won a few races.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.594
Wait a second,
I'm still angry at you!

16:36.596 --> 16:38.096
Faster, Minimus!

16:38.098 --> 16:39.564
Go, go, go!

16:39.566 --> 16:40.565
Hyah!

16:44.503 --> 16:46.704
That's it, Tempest!
Reel them in!

16:46.706 --> 16:48.539
Gavin! Prepare the rope.

16:53.145 --> 16:54.879
Aunt Tilly!
They're catching up!

16:54.881 --> 16:58.049
No worries. I know just
the thing to slow them down.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.552
Where did
all this come from?

17:01.554 --> 17:02.653
So sorry, sir.

17:02.655 --> 17:03.788
They're spoiling
my suit!

17:06.892 --> 17:09.160
Minimus, I just
don't understand
why you're so angry.

17:09.162 --> 17:13.564
Because finding this valley
is all you care about.

17:13.566 --> 17:14.866
You know, when you took off,

17:14.868 --> 17:16.834
you didn't just
leave the stable.

17:16.836 --> 17:19.570
You left Mom and Dad
and me!

17:19.572 --> 17:20.772
Look out!

17:20.774 --> 17:22.907
MINIMUS: Whoa!

17:22.909 --> 17:24.042
Whoa!

17:24.044 --> 17:25.176
Sofia!

17:26.211 --> 17:27.779
Gotcha!

17:27.781 --> 17:29.113
Your bag!

17:30.282 --> 17:31.949
Oh, hold on!

17:33.118 --> 17:35.086
You're lucky
she's all right.

17:35.088 --> 17:37.255
Look, Minimus, there's
something you should know.

17:37.257 --> 17:38.723
Mazzimo, Look out!

17:39.691 --> 17:40.725
No!

17:40.727 --> 17:41.726
No!

17:41.728 --> 17:43.561
I'll get you loose!

17:43.563 --> 17:45.696
Ow! He's got my wing!

17:45.698 --> 17:49.067
Excellent! Now they have to fly
whichever way we pull.

17:49.069 --> 17:51.769
Let's land so we can secure them
for the ride back.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.237
Shouldn't we
let the runt go?

17:53.239 --> 17:54.605
No, let's keep him.

17:54.607 --> 17:56.707
Teach that
little princess a lesson.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.209
The prince caught them!

17:58.211 --> 18:00.611
( whinnying )

18:00.613 --> 18:03.047
Then we'll just have
to un-catch them.

18:03.049 --> 18:05.249
How? The prince has a sword.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.618
All we have is...an umbrella.

18:07.620 --> 18:10.621
The umbrella can be mightier
than the sword, Sofia.

18:10.623 --> 18:12.256
We need your bag.

18:12.258 --> 18:14.258
I'm sure there are tons of
things we can use in there.

18:14.260 --> 18:15.593
Let's land and look for it.

18:15.595 --> 18:16.594
Okey-dokey.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.063
( whinnying )

18:19.065 --> 18:20.665
Let's spread out.

18:20.667 --> 18:21.699
I'll check over here.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.034
You check over there.

18:30.609 --> 18:32.844
Oh, where is it?

18:34.947 --> 18:36.013
Oh!

18:36.015 --> 18:39.016
Oh, I'm never going to find it!

18:39.018 --> 18:40.718
I can't do this.

18:40.720 --> 18:41.953
I can't do any of this.

18:41.955 --> 18:44.322
I'm no storykeeper.
( amulet tinkling )

18:44.324 --> 18:46.324
( gasps )

18:49.228 --> 18:50.962
Have I got your attention?

18:50.964 --> 18:52.396
Merida!

18:52.398 --> 18:54.899
How can I
help you, Sofia?

18:54.901 --> 18:56.701
My friends are
in great danger,

18:56.703 --> 18:58.903
but I don't know
how you can help,

18:58.905 --> 19:00.805
unless you know
where Tilly's bag is.

19:00.807 --> 19:03.107
Oh, you don't
need her bag 'o' tricks.

19:03.109 --> 19:06.777
You're searching for the wrong
thing in the wrong place.

19:06.779 --> 19:09.380
What you need
can only be found within you.

19:09.382 --> 19:10.982
What's that?

19:10.984 --> 19:14.652
The belief that you
can save them yourself.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.220
That's just it.

19:16.222 --> 19:18.055
I'm still getting used
to being a princess.

19:18.057 --> 19:20.291
How am I supposed to
finish all those stories
in the library

19:20.293 --> 19:22.860

finish this one?

I can't stand being
tied up like this.

22:02.221 --> 22:04.955
Now you know how I feel
every day I spend
in a horse stall.

22:04.957 --> 22:06.857
That's why
I had to leave home,

22:06.859 --> 22:08.326
and it was the toughest thing
I've ever done,

22:08.328 --> 22:10.328
'cause, you know,
I love you.

22:10.330 --> 22:11.595
But I couldn't stay
in a place

22:11.597 --> 22:13.264
where I felt all tied up
all the time.

22:13.266 --> 22:14.265
You know what I mean?

22:14.267 --> 22:16.834
Yeah, Mazzimo, I...I do.

22:16.836 --> 22:18.469
I finally do.

22:18.471 --> 22:20.604
I'm sorry
I was so angry at you.

22:20.606 --> 22:23.974
I'm sorry I got you
all caught up in this.

22:23.976 --> 22:27.611
Oh! Do we have
to take 'em back, Ellegra?

22:27.613 --> 22:29.613
We are royal horses,
Tempest.

22:29.615 --> 22:31.849
We have to do what
the prince commands.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.551
To the castle, Tempest!

22:33.553 --> 22:34.852
( whinnying )

22:34.854 --> 22:36.220
Whoa!

22:37.489 --> 22:39.190
( whinnying )

22:42.260 --> 22:45.029
Uh, Sofia, I hate to
be a stickler for details,

22:45.031 --> 22:47.565
but do have
any kind of a plan?

22:49.935 --> 22:52.970
Let's hope the umbrella is
mightier than the sword.

22:52.972 --> 22:53.971
Now fly me to Minimus.

22:53.973 --> 22:56.307
But be as quiet as you can.

22:56.309 --> 22:59.076
Gotcha!
Goin' into stealth mode.

23:10.255 --> 23:12.056
I don't know about you,

23:12.058 --> 23:13.924
but this racing about
has made me famished.

23:13.926 --> 23:16.160
I hope lunch is
ready when we return.

23:23.935 --> 23:26.103
Unh! Unh!

23:27.172 --> 23:28.172
Sofia?!

23:28.174 --> 23:29.440
(whispering)
Shhh!

23:29.442 --> 23:30.941
Athena, go back and
get Aunt Tilly.

23:30.943 --> 23:32.042
Done and done!

23:34.045 --> 23:35.112
( grunts )

23:35.114 --> 23:36.514
Prince Roderick!

23:38.583 --> 23:40.551
Ah, Princess Sofia.

23:40.553 --> 23:41.919
You can have
your horse back.

23:41.921 --> 23:43.521
I still have mine.

23:43.523 --> 23:46.323
Now fly along home
before someone gets hurt.

23:46.325 --> 23:47.324
En garde!

23:47.326 --> 23:48.926
An umbrella?

23:48.928 --> 23:50.394
What do you expect
to do with that?

23:50.396 --> 23:52.563
Wait for rain?
( laughs )

23:52.565 --> 23:54.932
You can't be serious.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.333
I'll chop
that thing in half.

23:56.335 --> 23:57.935
You won't get the chance.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.170
Hyah!

24:01.106 --> 24:03.174
Hyah!

24:03.176 --> 24:04.308
What is she doing?

24:04.310 --> 24:05.643
Tuck your wings, Minimus!

24:05.645 --> 24:07.011
Tucked and ready!

24:10.348 --> 24:12.183
Whoa! Ouchee!

24:16.121 --> 24:17.254
Prince Roderick!

24:19.057 --> 24:20.391
Happy trails!

24:20.393 --> 24:23.093
Gavin, come and fetch me.

24:24.629 --> 24:26.297
I just need to get
you untied.

24:26.299 --> 24:28.299
Take your time,
Princess.

24:28.301 --> 24:30.067
We shoulda let you go
in the first place.

24:30.069 --> 24:32.136
Here, Sofia. Let me.

24:32.138 --> 24:34.972
( whinnying )

24:34.974 --> 24:36.574
All right, let's go
back for Aunt Tilly.

24:36.576 --> 24:39.076
Sofia!
Look what I found!

24:39.078 --> 24:40.611
SOFIA: Your bag.

24:40.613 --> 24:43.113
MAZZIMO: Hey!
It's the Glittering Gorge!

24:43.115 --> 24:44.582
That's the way
to Wildwing Valley!

24:44.584 --> 24:46.083
Then let's go.

24:46.085 --> 24:48.486
Mazzimo, do you mind
if I come along?

24:48.488 --> 24:50.754
I think
I've had enough
of Prince Roderick.

24:50.756 --> 24:52.089
Sure thing, Tempest.

24:52.091 --> 24:53.724
( whinnying )

24:55.594 --> 24:57.027
( whinnying )

24:58.497 --> 25:00.664
Where is Tempest going?

25:00.666 --> 25:02.099
Ohh!

25:02.101 --> 25:03.167
Wait for me!

25:03.169 --> 25:04.668
( whinnying )

25:04.670 --> 25:06.370
RODERICK:
Ellegra!

25:06.372 --> 25:08.572
What a thoroughly
ungrateful horse.

25:08.574 --> 25:10.407
Guess we're walking,
sire.

25:12.177 --> 25:14.745
Uh, Mazzimo, that looks
like a dead end up ahead.

25:14.747 --> 25:16.480
It's a hidden valley,
remember?

25:16.482 --> 25:19.216
Sofia, why are we flying
right toward that cliff?

25:19.218 --> 25:20.751
Mazzimo says it's the way
to the valley,

25:20.753 --> 25:22.052
and I believe him.

25:22.054 --> 25:23.654
Well, I guess
one way or another,

25:23.656 --> 25:25.189
we're going to finish
this story!

25:25.191 --> 25:27.091
I can't look!

25:35.800 --> 25:37.401
It was an illusion!

25:37.403 --> 25:39.169
You can open
your eyes now, Minimus.

25:39.171 --> 25:41.071
You'll wanna see this.

25:45.343 --> 25:48.679
Wildwing Valley!
I'm finally here!

25:48.681 --> 25:50.381
( whinnying )

25:57.722 --> 26:00.057
Welcome to the valley.
I'm Marchand.

26:00.059 --> 26:04.128
Mazzimo. I've been
lookin' for this place
for a long time.

26:04.130 --> 26:06.196
Hey! Why don't you stay
with me, Minimus?

26:06.198 --> 26:08.299
I know Mazzimo gotta roam,

26:08.301 --> 26:10.467
but Minimus
gotta go home.

26:10.469 --> 26:14.104
I guess we're just horses
of a different color,

26:14.106 --> 26:16.574
but you're still my brother,
and I love you.

26:16.576 --> 26:18.175
I love you, too, bro.

26:18.177 --> 26:20.177
I'll come back
and visit you sometime.

26:20.179 --> 26:21.712
You know where to find me.

26:21.714 --> 26:23.747
MARCHAND:
Time to hit the skies!

26:23.749 --> 26:25.716
( whinnying )

26:29.120 --> 26:30.487
Bye, Mazzimo.
Fly safe!

26:42.100 --> 26:43.634
Congratulations, Sofia.

26:43.636 --> 26:45.803
You finished
your first story.

26:45.805 --> 26:47.304
So what's next?

26:47.306 --> 26:48.872
Why don't you have
a seat and find out...

26:48.874 --> 26:50.774
storykeeper?
