<b>THE MISERABLE MILL:</b>
part TWO

01:22.492 --> 01:26.617
I've called every town,
business and bus stop

01:26.700 --> 01:30.783
within 100 miles of Lake Lachrymose,
and no one has seen the Baudelaires.

01:34.908 --> 01:36.408
I'm finished, Eleanora!

01:36.492 --> 01:40.575
If I hadn't lost those orphans,
I'd be getting a promotion right now.

01:41.533 --> 01:44.742
Mr. Tamerlane is gonna fire me
at any time.

01:46.075 --> 01:48.367
That's him! Pick it up!
No, don't pick it up!

01:48.450 --> 01:49.825
Answer it! Hang up!

01:49.908 --> 01:51.825
No! Yes! No...

01:51.908 --> 01:53.617
Get a hold of yourself!

02:00.867 --> 02:02.575
Poe speaking.

02:02.658 --> 02:04.575
<i>Poe, this is Tamerlane.</i>

02:04.658 --> 02:08.032
<i>I've received orders
that I can't let you go.</i>

02:08.116 --> 02:10.407
<i>But if you don't find those orphans,
I'll make sure you end up</i>

02:10.491 --> 02:14.117
<i>handing out cannoli to incontinent adults
on the new accounts desk.</i>

02:14.200 --> 02:17.617
<i>- Am I clear?</i>
- Yes, Mr. Tamerlane, yes.

02:17.700 --> 02:18.700
<i>Take it off.</i>

02:21.575 --> 02:23.575
- No.
<i>- Take it off.</i>

02:23.658 --> 02:26.033
No!

02:28.533 --> 02:30.783
No, please.

02:32.033 --> 02:34.242
No, don't make... No.

02:34.325 --> 02:37.450
<i>Call me when you've found those orphans.</i>

02:41.033 --> 02:42.117
Leave it to me, Artie.

02:42.200 --> 02:44.700
Before I was editor in chief
of the <i>Daily Punctilio,</i>

02:44.783 --> 02:47.908
I cut my teeth
as an investigative journalist.

02:50.700 --> 02:52.575
Oh.

02:54.367 --> 02:56.367
It's time I got back to my roots.

03:00.367 --> 03:01.908
<i>"Seeing in black and white"</i>

03:01.992 --> 03:04.200
is a way of saying
that a person looks at the world

03:04.283 --> 03:07.492
in a manner that is oversimplified
and often incorrect.

03:07.575 --> 03:11.908
Like many newspapers, the <i>Daily Punctilio</i>
is printed in black and white,

03:11.992 --> 03:16.242
and its look at the world
is oversimplified and often incorrect.

03:17.950 --> 03:20.992
The death of noted scientist
Dr. Montgomery Montgomery

03:21.075 --> 03:22.742
was not due to snake allergies.

03:24.283 --> 03:26.408
The destruction
of Josephine Anwhistle's home

03:26.492 --> 03:29.117
was not the work
of a cabal of real estate agents.

03:31.658 --> 03:34.075
Lemony Snicket is not dead.

03:35.283 --> 03:38.867
I am sorry to say
that there was not a terrible accident

03:38.950 --> 03:41.783
at the Lucky Smells Lumbermill
during the Baudelaires' time there.

03:41.867 --> 03:43.117
There were two.

03:43.783 --> 03:45.867
It is my duty
to report these events correctly,

03:45.950 --> 03:47.283
the way they actually happened.

03:47.367 --> 03:50.492
But if you prefer to look at the world
in black and white,

03:50.575 --> 03:53.450
then you should avert your eyes
or pick up a newspaper instead.

03:53.533 --> 03:55.992
Because I know the shocking truth
behind the accidents

03:56.075 --> 03:58.950
atAia?a Ie?eoauaoamells Lumbermill,
and I can assure you...

04:00.117 --> 04:01.700
it's better if you can't see.

04:06.408 --> 04:08.450
- Thank you. I can see.
- Well, of course you can.

04:08.533 --> 04:12.783
I'm an excellent optometrist,
no matter what the medical board says.

04:12.867 --> 04:15.200
Well, hello, little girls.
What are your names?

04:15.283 --> 04:17.908
You know our names, and that wig
and that lipstick don't fool us.

04:17.992 --> 04:20.325
I don't know
what you're talking about.

04:20.408 --> 04:23.575
I'm Dr. Orwell's receptionist.
My name is Shirley.

04:23.658 --> 04:28.283
- You mean Shirley Count Olaf?
- Actually, my last name is St. Ives.

04:28.367 --> 04:31.075
It says so on my name tag, see?

04:32.145 --> 04:32.718
Nametag schmametag.

04:32.742 --> 04:34.700
- What have you done to Klaus?
- You were right.

04:34.783 --> 04:36.617
These children are horribly impolite.

04:36.700 --> 04:39.492
They really should be more careful,
Dr. Orwell.

04:39.575 --> 04:42.783
If they were to do something impolite
to me, like, for example,

04:42.867 --> 04:44.450
call me by the wrong name,

04:44.533 --> 04:46.492
I would have to do something
impolite to them,

04:46.575 --> 04:49.783
like, for example,
tear their hair out with my bare hands.

04:49.867 --> 04:50.950
Cookie?

04:54.825 --> 04:55.992
What's all this?

04:56.075 --> 04:58.242
I don't pay you in gum
to stand around gabbing!

04:58.325 --> 05:00.825
Oh, hello, children.

05:00.908 --> 05:02.742
I hope you're having a nice visit
with the optometrist.

05:02.825 --> 05:05.825
Charles, you have to listen.
This woman is a notorious villain.

05:05.908 --> 05:07.367
- And she's not a woman.
- Nonsense!

05:07.450 --> 05:11.575
Dr. Orwell has provided free eye exams
to Lucky Smells employees for years.

05:11.658 --> 05:14.367
And there's nothing villainous
about free healthcare.

05:15.283 --> 05:17.158
Clearly she's a woman.
Look at her pantsuit.

05:17.242 --> 05:19.033
I'm surprised at you, Baudelaires.

05:19.117 --> 05:21.533
Women can be doctors
just as men can be receptionists.

05:21.617 --> 05:23.450
I'm talking about the receptionist.

05:23.533 --> 05:25.408
Hi, I'm Cookie. Shirley?

05:25.492 --> 05:28.533
- I'm Shirley. Cookie?
- Don't mind if I do.

05:30.242 --> 05:32.117
Did you consider our little proposal?

05:32.200 --> 05:35.242
- What proposal?
- It doesn't concern you, Charles.

05:35.325 --> 05:37.658
Doesn't concern me? I'm your partner.

05:38.867 --> 05:41.242
I... I haven't seen you in my chair.

05:41.825 --> 05:43.992
- I have excellent vision.
- Well, vision changes.

05:46.242 --> 05:49.408
Just as I suspected. Cloudy, dull.

05:49.492 --> 05:51.617
- What color is this newspaper?
- Hmm, black and white?

05:51.700 --> 05:54.783
And color-blind, too.
You must come see me right away.

05:54.867 --> 05:58.033
Can't have a cloudy, dull-eyed partner.
How would you make my omelets?

05:58.117 --> 06:00.367
Now, ladies, would you like a ride?

06:00.450 --> 06:02.700
Handsome and a gentleman.

06:04.492 --> 06:05.575
Pleasure.

06:06.742 --> 06:08.325
Let's go, Charles.

06:08.408 --> 06:10.367
Hur-rah!

06:12.117 --> 06:13.658
What a nice lady.

06:13.742 --> 06:16.700
<i>Lucky Smells visiting hours are over.</i>

06:16.783 --> 06:18.783
<i>Get back to work!</i>

06:18.867 --> 06:21.617
Yes, sir.

06:26.783 --> 06:28.325
<i>Lucky boy,</i>

06:28.408 --> 06:30.117
<i>would you like to turn on
the stamping machine?</i>

06:30.200 --> 06:31.242
Yes, sir.

06:36.575 --> 06:37.575
Klaus?

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
What's wrong with Klaus?

06:53.000 --> 06:54.500
I wish I knew.

06:58.492 --> 07:00.242
There's nothing to worry about.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.117
Your brother is smiling.

07:03.200 --> 07:06.325
He would never operate a machine
without reading the manual first.

07:06.408 --> 07:08.283
He's operating it perfectly.

07:08.367 --> 07:09.950
You're doing great, Klaus!

07:13.367 --> 07:16.700
Move as fast as you can
and then move faster!

07:25.533 --> 07:27.908
Count Olaf and Dr. Orwell
did something to Klaus.

07:27.992 --> 07:29.575
He's not himself.

07:29.658 --> 07:33.450
One moment he's normal, and the next...
he's like a zombie.

07:35.908 --> 07:37.742
I saw a scary movie like that once.

07:38.492 --> 07:39.867
Was it <i>Zombies in the Snow?</i>

07:39.950 --> 07:43.325
What? No.
It was <i>Hypnotists in the Forest.</i>

07:43.408 --> 07:45.325
To be honest with you,
I didn't really get it.

07:45.408 --> 07:47.367
But I loved the fact
that it was in black and white.

07:47.450 --> 07:49.200
Focus, lumber minions!

07:49.283 --> 07:50.533
Did you just say "hypnotists"?

07:51.367 --> 07:53.867
Cheer up. I'm sure that if you look
on the bright side...

07:53.950 --> 07:55.408
Look on your right side!

07:56.367 --> 07:58.200
Get out of the way!

07:58.500 --> 07:59.500
Uh oh?

07:59.867 --> 08:01.950
Code red! Code red!

08:04.283 --> 08:05.408
Get out of the way!

08:06.617 --> 08:07.700
Whoa!

08:07.783 --> 08:09.575
Ah!

08:16.492 --> 08:18.658
<i>They won't stop coming, Dolores.</i>

08:18.742 --> 08:20.825
<i>They're like zombies, only different.</i>

08:20.908 --> 08:22.533
<i>I'm afraid they've been...</i>

08:27.700 --> 08:28.575
<i>hypnotized.</i>

08:33.533 --> 08:36.366
Many people think hypnosis
is only in scary movies.

08:37.866 --> 08:38.991
<i>Dolores, avert your eyes!</i>

08:39.075 --> 08:41.700
<i>But, Dolores, no!</i>

08:41.783 --> 08:43.241
Those people are wrong.

08:43.325 --> 08:46.242
The <i>Encyclopedia Hypnotica</i>
tells of a woman who,

08:46.325 --> 08:48.908
whenever she'd hear the word "omelet,"
would cluck like a chicken.

08:51.575 --> 08:54.033
<i>What are you doing?</i>

08:54.117 --> 08:56.033
And a man who,
upon hearing the word "Nero,"

08:56.117 --> 08:58.325
could suddenly play an instrument
he'd never studied.

09:00.117 --> 09:03.033
<i>Dolores, put down that violin!</i>

09:03.992 --> 09:07.075
The <i>Encyclopedia Hypnotica</i>
does not mention the fatal accident

09:07.158 --> 09:10.033
that happened during the Baudelaires' time
at Lucky Smells Lumbermill.

09:13.367 --> 09:16.867
"Fatal" is a word here which means
"caused the death of one person who...

09:16.950 --> 09:19.450
it is my solemn duty to inform you...

09:21.575 --> 09:22.700
was not Phil."

09:25.617 --> 09:26.992
- We're here for you, Phil.
- Come on.

09:27.075 --> 09:29.283
- You're gonna be all right.
- Bear down now, Phil.

09:30.200 --> 09:33.283
I'm okay!

09:33.367 --> 09:36.575
Code red! Code red! Code red!

09:36.658 --> 09:39.200
<i>- Code red! Code red!</i>
- What's going on out there?

09:39.283 --> 09:40.783
Code red!

09:43.950 --> 09:45.908
It's too heavy! It won't budge!

10:10.867 --> 10:12.492
I was saving that for later.

10:34.283 --> 10:38.283
- Oh!
- Oh, boy!

10:38.700 --> 10:41.033
Half-price pedicures for life!

10:41.117 --> 10:43.033
If somebody can help me up to my foot,

10:43.742 --> 10:46.700
I'm pretty sure I'll be able
to get back to work.

10:46.783 --> 10:48.367
You need to go to a hospital.

10:48.450 --> 10:51.700
We earned those coupons last month.
50% off Ahab Memorial.

10:51.783 --> 10:53.117
Uh, two of us will chip in.

10:53.200 --> 10:55.825
- We'll get your leg fixed up.
- It can't be fixed.

10:57.575 --> 11:00.075
Oh! I wouldn't say that.

11:00.158 --> 11:02.825
I mean, Phil's leg
is going to need some...

11:03.325 --> 11:05.158
eh... help.

11:05.242 --> 11:08.325
But, uh, we're fortunate that, uh,
the damage wasn't worse.

11:08.408 --> 11:11.742
Wasn't worse?
The debarker dispenser is destroyed.

11:11.825 --> 11:15.283
- Who's responsible?
- Klaus Baudelaire caused the accident.

11:15.783 --> 11:18.033
He said he knew
how to operate heavy machinery.

11:18.117 --> 11:20.908
- That's not true.
- Well, now I know that.

11:20.992 --> 11:22.367
I meant it was a mistake.

11:22.450 --> 11:26.075
Excuses, excuses.
Just like your parents.

11:26.158 --> 11:27.283
They burnt down the town,

11:27.367 --> 11:29.617
and now you've come back
to finish the job.

11:29.700 --> 11:31.158
Sir, be reasonable.

11:31.242 --> 11:33.992
Perhaps we should reevaluate
our safety procedures.

11:34.075 --> 11:36.575
Or perhaps we shouldn't let children
near dangerous machines.

11:37.658 --> 11:38.992
I got a better solution.

11:39.075 --> 11:42.617
One more mistake, Baudelaires,
and I'm gonna send you away

11:42.700 --> 11:46.450
to a place where you'll learn
the value of discipline and child labor.

11:46.533 --> 11:49.950
As it happens,
I have just the place in mind.

11:51.242 --> 11:52.783
Now get back to work!

11:52.867 --> 11:56.075
This mistake has cost me
an inordinate amount of money.

12:04.325 --> 12:07.950
It was an accident.
Klaus didn't mean to hurt Phil. I know it.

12:08.033 --> 12:10.575
I'm sorry. When Sir gets like this,
there's nothing I can do.

12:10.658 --> 12:12.033
So you're just gonna do nothing?

12:12.492 --> 12:14.950
If you can't speak up for us,
at least speak up for yourself.

12:16.783 --> 12:20.117
You're right, my dear.
I've been a silent partner for too long.

12:20.700 --> 12:23.825
And this mill...
it has too many secrets.

12:24.450 --> 12:26.658
It's time you learnt one
about your parents.

12:26.742 --> 12:27.783
Charles?

12:30.117 --> 12:33.492
- Meet me after lunch in the library.
- You can't tell us now?

12:34.075 --> 12:35.950
Well, I would,
but I've got an appointment.

12:38.950 --> 12:40.450
I don't understand.

12:40.533 --> 12:42.450
Everyone is staring at me
like I'm a pariah.

12:44.075 --> 12:45.283
"Pariah" means "outcast."

12:45.367 --> 12:46.783
Klaus, it's you.

12:48.283 --> 12:51.158
- What happened to Phil?
- I'm okay.

12:51.242 --> 12:52.450
We need to talk.

12:53.033 --> 12:55.200
If the world ever feels confusing,

12:55.283 --> 12:59.450
as if people are having secret meetings
to plot against you behind your back,

12:59.533 --> 13:01.492
it's useful to know they are.

13:01.575 --> 13:03.783
And the odd behavior of Klaus Baudelaire

13:03.867 --> 13:06.325
could be traced to a secret meeting
that happened not long after

13:06.408 --> 13:09.200
the Baudelaires arrived
at Lucky Smells Lumbermill.

13:09.283 --> 13:12.200
Like most things from the past,
it's best seen...

13:12.283 --> 13:13.825
<i>in black and white.</i>

13:13.908 --> 13:16.033
We have a good deal, you and I.

13:16.117 --> 13:20.158
You provide a steady stream of employees
for me to practice my craft,

13:20.242 --> 13:24.242
and I send them back
after I've fixed how they see.

13:24.325 --> 13:26.575
Frankly, I never thought weekly eye exams

13:26.658 --> 13:29.033
would have such an impact
on employee morale.

13:29.117 --> 13:32.450
Oops! I dropped a pen on the floor.
Would you mind helping me look for it?

13:33.575 --> 13:36.367
Does he really not know
how you make his workers so compliant?

13:36.450 --> 13:38.450
Doesn't know, doesn't want to know.

13:38.533 --> 13:41.033
He gets free labor,
we split the profits 50-50.

13:41.117 --> 13:43.450
You're terrible, and I love it.

13:44.408 --> 13:45.492
Found it.

13:45.992 --> 13:47.825
You said you had some business to discuss.

13:47.908 --> 13:51.117
Actually, my receptionist
has a story to share.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.200
It's okay, Shirley.

13:59.367 --> 14:01.158
My name is Shirley.

14:01.242 --> 14:04.700
I'm a poor receptionist
who lives all alone

14:04.783 --> 14:07.533
and wants very much
to raise children of her own.

14:08.783 --> 14:12.033
Alas, the helter-skelter life
of a working girl

14:12.117 --> 14:14.158
has left me no time to find a partner,

14:14.242 --> 14:16.700
and the cruel reality
of adoption economics

14:16.783 --> 14:19.992
has left me unable to purchase
even the runtiest of orphans.

14:22.867 --> 14:28.533
And so I wait and work...
and grow old dreaming of children.

14:28.617 --> 14:30.117
Three of them to be precise.

14:30.200 --> 14:32.617
A bucktoothed baby,
a smarty-pants little boy

14:32.700 --> 14:35.408
and a girl with an enormous fortune...

14:35.492 --> 14:38.117
uh, uh... bank account... uh, uh...

14:38.200 --> 14:40.242
...heart.

14:44.700 --> 14:45.783
Thank you.

14:49.117 --> 14:51.158
It's a moving story.

14:51.908 --> 14:55.450
And frankly,
it's a coincident that defies belief.

14:56.158 --> 14:59.992
But a trio of orphans
with those exact qualities

15:00.075 --> 15:01.908
arrived at the mill just yesterday.

15:01.992 --> 15:03.408
- I'll take them.
- Excuse me?

15:03.492 --> 15:07.408
I mean, don't you want to see
those children in a loving home?

15:07.492 --> 15:08.367
Absolutely not.

15:09.950 --> 15:11.533
Beg your pardon?

15:11.617 --> 15:13.408
They're an economic bonanza.

15:13.492 --> 15:16.242
They do the work of an adult
for half the gum.

15:16.325 --> 15:18.825
What kind of a businessman would I be
to part with them?

15:18.908 --> 15:21.117
What would make you part with them?

15:21.700 --> 15:23.367
I suppose if they became costly.

15:23.450 --> 15:25.117
What might make them costly?

15:25.200 --> 15:28.117
They made a...
costly mistake.

15:28.200 --> 15:30.158
- Like a fatal accident?
- A bit drastic, but...

15:30.658 --> 15:32.408
Deal! Oops! Dropped another pen.

15:34.033 --> 15:35.200
Did you hear that?

15:35.283 --> 15:37.492
All we have to do is get
one of those brats to murder someone.

15:37.575 --> 15:39.742
Oh, they'll never do that.
They're total goody two-shoes.

15:39.825 --> 15:41.992
You so underestimate me.

15:42.075 --> 15:45.158
Hmm, I smell an evil plan.

15:47.617 --> 15:50.242
Thank you so much
for your time, Sir.

15:54.158 --> 15:55.742
I can't believe it.

15:55.825 --> 15:58.325
It does sound like something
from a scary movie.

15:58.408 --> 15:59.492
I believe that part.

15:59.575 --> 16:02.242
I read the <i>Encyclopedia Hypnotica</i>
last year.

16:02.325 --> 16:04.033
I can't believe I hurt Phil.

16:04.950 --> 16:06.283
And I almost hurt you, Sunny.

16:06.950 --> 16:07.950
I didn't mean to.

16:08.477 --> 16:09.259
I know.

16:09.283 --> 16:12.950
Charles will be back soon.
He wants to help us.

16:13.033 --> 16:14.492
No.

16:15.200 --> 16:18.117
If Dr. Orwell did something to my brain,
I have to fix it.

16:18.200 --> 16:20.575
You can't go back there.
It's too dangerous.

16:20.658 --> 16:22.617
I don't care. I have to know.

16:23.200 --> 16:24.200
What if you get hurt?

16:24.283 --> 16:27.075
What if I cause another accident
and hurt more people?

16:27.867 --> 16:29.283
You're the one that wanted to stay here.

16:29.867 --> 16:32.158
You wanted to find out
what our parents were doing in this town.

16:32.242 --> 16:33.992
And I'm sorry I put us in danger.

16:34.075 --> 16:37.908
I don't know why they blame our parents
for the fire, and I don't care anymore.

16:37.992 --> 16:40.617
I just want you to be safe.
Count Olaf is here.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.742
- We have to leave.
- And we will.

16:45.908 --> 16:47.992
When I get back from Dr. Orwell's.

16:58.408 --> 17:00.283
What's that thing Samuel Beckett said?

17:01.533 --> 17:04.867
"I can't go on. I'll go on."

17:04.950 --> 17:07.242
Let's go on. Together.

17:10.367 --> 17:11.825
Was it fatal?

17:12.867 --> 17:16.242
Just a leg?
Call me when there's a real maiming.

17:16.325 --> 17:18.742
And don't take your eyes
off those orphans!

17:18.825 --> 17:21.657
Well, this one's too easy.

17:21.742 --> 17:24.450
There's just no challenge
when they love taking orders.

17:24.532 --> 17:27.242
Those are covered in eye junk.
Order me a new box of gloves.

17:27.325 --> 17:28.950
Do I look like your receptionist?

17:29.033 --> 17:30.908
Yes, now act like one.

17:31.825 --> 17:34.450
You wouldn't have the Baudelaires at all
if it weren't for me.

17:34.533 --> 17:35.908
I don't have them.

17:35.992 --> 17:37.742
You were supposed to hypnotize
the bookworm

17:37.825 --> 17:39.367
into causing a fatal accident.

17:39.450 --> 17:42.242
Don't blame me for that.
I'm running a business

17:42.325 --> 17:43.992
while you're running around
wearing my clothes.

17:44.075 --> 17:46.408
How quickly we fall into old routines.

17:46.492 --> 17:49.575
Perhaps some old flames
are better snuffed out.

17:53.075 --> 17:54.700
Oh, Georgina...

17:55.617 --> 17:57.158
you little minx.

17:57.242 --> 17:59.742
You have lipstick on your teeth.

17:59.825 --> 18:02.117
Yes, it's part of my character.

18:26.992 --> 18:29.742
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.

18:33.700 --> 18:37.450
Partner trouble.
But you'd know all about that, Charles.

18:39.658 --> 18:40.783
Yes, sir.

18:40.867 --> 18:42.158
She has Charles.

18:42.242 --> 18:44.450
Now, Charles,
would you like to look at the screen

18:44.533 --> 18:45.992
and tell me what you see?

18:46.075 --> 18:48.658
- Orphans.
- Dangerous orphans.

18:48.742 --> 18:50.783
Charles, don't you think
your partner and you

18:50.867 --> 18:53.492
would be a lot happier
without these orphans around?

18:53.575 --> 18:56.242
We could finally be happy
without those orphans around.

18:56.325 --> 18:57.617
She's hypnotizing him.

18:58.408 --> 19:01.408
You will awaken from your trance
when I say the word...

19:01.492 --> 19:02.700
Charles...

19:02.783 --> 19:05.242
would you like to do
your impersonation of a chicken?

19:05.325 --> 19:08.575
I told you to wait in the waiting room.

19:08.658 --> 19:11.158
- Did you? I must've forgot.
- Mmm.

19:11.242 --> 19:13.075
Charles, would you like to stop?

19:13.158 --> 19:15.908
- That's Shirley?
- We should go before she sees us.

19:15.992 --> 19:16.992
Wait.

19:17.075 --> 19:19.783
I really wanna practice
saying the secret words.

19:19.867 --> 19:23.158
Why? So you could take over
and you wouldn't need me anymore?

19:23.242 --> 19:26.950
- Someone has trust issues.
- Of course I do. I dated you!

19:27.033 --> 19:28.700
Secret words?

19:28.783 --> 19:30.617
According to the <i>Encyclopedia Hypnotica,</i>

19:30.700 --> 19:33.533
a hypnotist chooses one word
to induce hypnotic suggestion,

19:33.617 --> 19:37.117
like "Nero" or... or "omelet,"

19:37.200 --> 19:38.658
and another one to break it.

19:38.742 --> 19:42.200
Charles, would you tell Dr. Orwell
to please stop bringing up the past?

19:42.867 --> 19:44.408
Stop bringing up the past.

19:44.492 --> 19:47.450
Charles, would you tell Count Olaf
to stop talking in that voice?

19:47.533 --> 19:48.908
Stop talking in that voice.

19:48.992 --> 19:52.117
- You drank all of my wine.
- You poisoned my coffee.

19:52.200 --> 19:55.450
- You tried to hypnotize me!
- It was the only way to shut you up!

19:55.533 --> 19:57.492
What was that?

19:58.408 --> 19:59.783
There's nothing up there.

20:01.992 --> 20:05.158
If there's nothing up there,
then what was that noise?

20:43.992 --> 20:45.033
Sorry about that.

20:45.867 --> 20:48.783
We all have skeletons in our closet,
metaphorically,

20:48.867 --> 20:51.825
meaning things from our past
we'd prefer not leave lying around

20:51.908 --> 20:56.450
because they are painful or incriminating
or would create unnecessary clutter.

20:56.533 --> 21:01.992
In my closet, I keep a 200-page book
written by the woman I loved,

21:02.075 --> 21:04.658
explaining at great length
and in specific detail

21:04.742 --> 21:07.033
the reason she could not marry me,

21:07.117 --> 21:10.908
which, if I were to leave out in the open,
I would find myself reading over and over.

21:10.992 --> 21:13.283
It would be as if my darling Beatrice

21:13.367 --> 21:17.158
were bringing me bad news every day
and every night of my life.

21:26.992 --> 21:29.617
Unless you are a murderer
or a taxidermist,

21:29.700 --> 21:31.742
it is rare to have actual skeletons
in your closet,

21:31.825 --> 21:33.367
as opposed to metaphorical ones.

21:33.450 --> 21:35.533
But as Klaus had just discovered...

21:39.825 --> 21:41.242
<i>Dr. Orwell's closet...</i>

21:42.367 --> 21:43.200
had both.

21:43.283 --> 21:45.450
Nothing to be frightened of.

21:45.533 --> 21:49.033
I'm sure many doctors have skeletons
to study anatomy.

21:49.617 --> 21:52.325
I suppose they could keep them in closets.

21:52.408 --> 21:56.200
But Dr. Orwell's an eye doctor.
Skeletons don't even have eyes.

22:03.492 --> 22:04.325
Look.

22:04.408 --> 22:06.700
- What are those?
- Records.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.875
Any Tito Puente?

22:08.908 --> 22:11.908
Not that type of record, Sunny.
Medical records.

22:11.992 --> 22:13.783
For employee eye exams.

22:14.783 --> 22:18.325
I don't think Charles and I were
the only victims of Dr. Orwell's hypnosis.

22:20.325 --> 22:21.992
I think it's the entire mill.

22:23.325 --> 22:24.825
That's why they never leave

22:24.908 --> 22:27.367
and why they're happy
to work for coupons and gum.

22:27.450 --> 22:29.367
It's probably why they think
our parents started that fire.

22:29.450 --> 22:31.617
We need to figure out the word
that breaks the trance.

22:31.700 --> 22:34.200
- We can use the library.
- We might not need the library.

22:34.283 --> 22:35.825
Are you sure you're not still hypnotized?

22:35.908 --> 22:37.867
After Phil's accident,

22:37.950 --> 22:40.200
do you remember the word
that brought me back to normal?

22:40.283 --> 22:41.700
I can't remember.

22:44.033 --> 22:46.408
We don't have to go back.
We can run away.

22:46.492 --> 22:49.075
- What if Count Olaf finds us again?
- We'll protect each other.

22:49.158 --> 22:51.783
How will we protect each other
if one of us is under a hypnotic trance?

22:51.867 --> 22:55.033
And we'd be abandoning those workers.
They're victims of Dr. Orwell, too.

22:55.658 --> 22:57.242
Our parents wanted us to be safe.

22:57.325 --> 22:59.867
We don't know what they wanted.
Not anymore.

22:59.950 --> 23:01.408
We don't know
why they were in Paltryville.

23:01.492 --> 23:03.283
We don't know why there were
so many things they never told us.

23:04.283 --> 23:07.158
But we do know
how we remember them.

23:07.242 --> 23:09.283
And the parents I remember
would've wanted us to help.

23:09.367 --> 23:10.575
Then we go back.

23:13.825 --> 23:16.075
Trying to run away, are ya?

23:17.367 --> 23:18.617
I'm not an idiot.

23:18.700 --> 23:20.700
I've been trying to figure out
what to do with you

23:20.783 --> 23:24.908
since you caused that accident
that crushed a man's debarker dispenser.

23:25.380 --> 23:26.176
Phil.

23:26.200 --> 23:27.950
That glib attitude will get you nowhere.

23:29.450 --> 23:32.700
Now, you wanna hear the good news
or the bad news first?

23:33.533 --> 23:34.992
The... the bad news.

23:35.075 --> 23:38.367
There's a local receptionist
who wants children of her own.

23:38.450 --> 23:39.617
You make one more mistake,

23:39.700 --> 23:42.117
and I'm gonna be forced to sack you
and send you to live with her.

23:42.825 --> 23:45.658
I've interviewed her
about her parenting methods, and...

23:46.617 --> 23:47.992
I can vouch for her fully.

23:48.075 --> 23:49.450
You can't send us to live with Shirley.

23:49.533 --> 23:51.617
And Klaus isn't responsible
for that accident.

23:51.700 --> 23:53.867
He was hypno...

23:53.950 --> 23:56.408
He was hyp...

23:56.492 --> 23:59.867
He was hypnotized,
just like the rest of the workers here!

23:59.950 --> 24:02.700
I don't care
what my employees do for a hobby.

24:04.408 --> 24:06.075
Do you even know
what's going at this mill?

24:06.158 --> 24:09.408
Are you aware of anything
outside that horrible cloud of smoke?

24:09.492 --> 24:11.867
"Don't ask, don't tell." That's my motto.

24:11.950 --> 24:13.325
Now is there anything else?

24:14.742 --> 24:16.492
What's the good news?

24:17.158 --> 24:19.200
It will build character.

24:19.783 --> 24:21.992
I was willing to forgive the accident.

24:22.075 --> 24:25.867
You three are an economic bonanza,
and I'm a softie at heart.

24:25.950 --> 24:29.617
But my partner convinced me that
I need to be a little more inflexible.

24:29.700 --> 24:31.117
Isn't that right, Charles?

24:32.408 --> 24:34.617
We'll finally be happy
without those orphans around.

24:38.325 --> 24:39.825
"It'll build character."

24:39.908 --> 24:41.117
That's just something people say

24:41.200 --> 24:43.533
when they're trying to make others
accept a miserable situation.

24:43.617 --> 24:44.617
It is miserable.

24:44.700 --> 24:46.325
If we can't find the word
to break your hypnosis,

24:46.408 --> 24:49.242
you could cause another accident
and we'd be in the hands of Count Olaf.

24:49.325 --> 24:50.742
You mean Shirley.

24:50.825 --> 24:53.283
- He looks like Father...
- When he went...

24:53.367 --> 24:54.908
To the masquerade ball.

24:57.825 --> 24:59.783
I don't want you to go away again.

25:09.867 --> 25:12.450
It seems darker in here
without Phil to find the bright side.

25:12.533 --> 25:14.950
It seems darker 'cause it is.

25:15.033 --> 25:17.117
Sir won't let us keep the lights on.

25:18.325 --> 25:22.242
He says we need to cut corners
to pay for a new debarker dispenser.

25:22.325 --> 25:25.617
I'm surprised they can show their faces
after what they did to Phil.

25:26.242 --> 25:27.242
It's not your fault.

25:27.325 --> 25:29.242
You're right. It's Count Olaf's.

25:30.000 --> 25:30.971
And Dr.Orwell's.

25:31.033 --> 25:33.783
They're a wretched pair of villains,
and they deserve each other.

25:33.867 --> 25:36.450
They deserve to be locked away
for a very long time.

25:36.533 --> 25:37.825
But for that to happen,

25:37.908 --> 25:39.783
we have to find the word
that wakes everyone up.

25:39.867 --> 25:41.242
So what do we do?

25:41.325 --> 25:43.575
Say a bunch of words out loud
and hope one of them works?

25:53.742 --> 25:55.200
Maybe this can help.

26:04.533 --> 26:05.658
"Aardvark."

26:08.033 --> 26:09.075
"Abacus."

26:09.783 --> 26:10.783
Shh!

26:13.658 --> 26:14.783
"Aberrant."

26:14.867 --> 26:16.908
You're waking everyone up.

26:20.658 --> 26:22.408
There has to be a better way.

26:42.492 --> 26:46.575
Lucky boy...
would you like to get to work?

27:14.200 --> 27:15.200
Things look bad.

27:15.283 --> 27:17.492
Sometimes when things look bad,
they turn out to be worse.

27:19.492 --> 27:22.408
There are fires all around us,
literally and figuratively.

27:22.492 --> 27:24.950
Then it's time we mount
a vigorous fire defense.

27:25.033 --> 27:26.450
Why do they keep talking about fire?

27:26.533 --> 27:28.408
- I know, right?
- We can hear you back there.

27:28.492 --> 27:30.700
If you'd gone to my school,
you would have flunked eavesdropping.

27:30.783 --> 27:32.825
What kind of school teaches eavesdropping?

27:32.908 --> 27:35.200
Come on, children. It's past your bedtime.

27:35.283 --> 27:36.992
- We've got a big day tomorrow.
- What's tomorrow?

27:37.075 --> 27:38.242
It's a secret.

28:23.450 --> 28:26.617
You've been fortunate so far,
you little twerp.

28:26.700 --> 28:27.992
But not anymore.

28:29.158 --> 28:30.658
Yeah, you tell 'em, boss.

28:31.283 --> 28:33.783
One more accident, and you're mine.

28:33.867 --> 28:37.825
And this will be the worst accident
the Lumbermill has ever seen.

28:43.617 --> 28:45.950
Now, you lucky brat,

28:46.033 --> 28:49.408
would you like to send that log
into that saw?

28:49.492 --> 28:51.367
- Yes, sir.
- Klaus, don't do it!

28:54.408 --> 28:59.367
Well, well, well.
If it isn't... the other two.

28:59.450 --> 29:02.158
You're just in time to see the accident.

29:02.242 --> 29:05.492
It's not an accident.
You're doing this on purpose!

29:05.575 --> 29:08.617
Let's not split hairs. That's Klaus' job.

29:08.700 --> 29:13.242
And you can shout as much as you want.
Your brother isn't here right now.

29:23.242 --> 29:25.158
Poor little orphan.

29:25.242 --> 29:27.742
Haven't you learned anything this year?

29:27.825 --> 29:30.450
Week? Season?

29:30.533 --> 29:33.742
Wherever you go, I will be waiting.

29:33.825 --> 29:37.492
Wherever you hide, I will hunt you down.

29:37.575 --> 29:40.533
I'm smarter. I'm pluckier.

29:40.617 --> 29:42.367
I'm stronger.

29:43.658 --> 29:46.033
Put some lower back into it!

29:51.075 --> 29:54.367
I'm unstoppable!

29:54.450 --> 29:56.033
Why do you hate us so much?

29:56.617 --> 29:58.617
Because it's fun.

29:58.700 --> 30:00.617
How are you doing back there, Charles?

30:00.700 --> 30:02.950
Oh! Just peachy!

30:03.033 --> 30:06.492
Wait till Sir finds out that his partner's
been turned into human boards.

30:06.575 --> 30:09.492
I bet he won't even wait
until the morning to fire...

30:14.575 --> 30:15.700
Where am I?

30:16.367 --> 30:17.950
What's going on?

30:18.950 --> 30:21.908
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!

30:21.992 --> 30:23.825
Fire! The secret word is "fire."

30:23.908 --> 30:25.950
Klaus, fire! Turn off the machine!

30:28.867 --> 30:30.492
Nice try.

30:30.575 --> 30:32.408
But did you really think
we'd use the same word

30:32.492 --> 30:35.033
on your bratty brother
that we used on the mill workeroaa?eea

30:36.283 --> 30:39.867
You will never find the word
to save your brother.

30:39.950 --> 30:43.492
And you certainly won't find it
in time to save Charles.

30:45.450 --> 30:47.492
Help me! Help me!

30:47.575 --> 30:50.908
Sorry, Charlie.
No one's coming to help you now.

30:50.992 --> 30:52.283
Help me!

30:58.492 --> 30:59.825
Where did the girl go?

31:01.575 --> 31:05.200
Perhaps you've been told
never to shout "fire" in a public place.

31:05.283 --> 31:07.950
When you shout "fire" and there isn't one,
it can cause chaos.

31:08.033 --> 31:09.825
Of course, when you shout "fire"
and there is one,

31:09.908 --> 31:12.117
it can cause chaos but also save lives.

31:12.200 --> 31:15.158
Still, there are times when shouting
"fire" can save lives

31:15.242 --> 31:16.617
even when there isn't one.

31:18.283 --> 31:20.783
For example, you may be trapped
in a motel room...

31:22.033 --> 31:24.033
with your enemies waiting outside.

31:24.117 --> 31:27.117
Shouting "fire"
will cause the kind of chaos

31:27.200 --> 31:29.825
that will allow you to escape undetected.

31:29.908 --> 31:33.492
Therefore, the life it saves
will be your own.

31:33.575 --> 31:35.450
Fire! Fire!

31:35.533 --> 31:36.992
Fire! Fire!

31:37.075 --> 31:39.700
- <i>Fire! Fire!</i>
- Where am I?

31:39.783 --> 31:41.783
<i>If you're in a town where</i>
<i>the workers have been warned</i>

31:41.867 --> 31:44.742
<i>never to talk about a terrible fire,
not because it was too terrible...</i>

31:44.825 --> 31:46.033
Why does my mouth taste like gum?

31:46.117 --> 31:47.325
<i>because the word "fire"</i>

31:47.408 --> 31:50.617
<i>would awaken them from a state
of complacency induced by hypnosis,</i>

31:50.700 --> 31:54.242
<i>shouting "fire" would cause chaos
and save lives.</i>

31:54.325 --> 31:56.992
Of course, there is the single most
important time to shout "fire,"

31:57.075 --> 31:58.617
and that is when there is one.

31:59.325 --> 32:02.783
<i>Sometimes, even shouting "fire"
cannot save every life.</i>

32:10.908 --> 32:12.033
Get 'em!

32:12.117 --> 32:13.158
What have you done?

32:13.908 --> 32:14.992
Shut the door!

32:17.908 --> 32:20.450
Help me! Help me!

32:25.450 --> 32:28.117
Open up! We want answers!

32:33.783 --> 32:36.617
Thank you, thank you!

32:38.658 --> 32:41.450
Lucky, would you like to cut
the log faster?

32:42.283 --> 32:44.867
Lucky, would you like to reverse
the direction of the log?

32:46.033 --> 32:49.617
- Lucky, push that lever forward!
- Lucky, pull the lever backward!

32:50.200 --> 32:51.367
Lucky, push!

32:52.117 --> 32:53.533
- Lucky, pull!
- Lucky!

32:53.617 --> 32:55.783
Don't listen to your sister.

32:55.867 --> 32:57.367
Hey, why didn't you think of that?

32:57.450 --> 33:01.825
I just stopped by to see if everything
was running smoothly, and I'm glad I did.

33:01.908 --> 33:03.950
- Because it wasn't.
- Ah!

33:04.033 --> 33:06.950
How did you even get inside?
There's an angry mob at the door.

33:07.533 --> 33:09.950
You're right.
I don't trust you with all my secrets.

33:10.825 --> 33:13.408
Oh, oh, oh!

33:14.200 --> 33:15.408
You know, they say holding a baby

33:15.492 --> 33:18.325
can make all these deep,
primal parenting instincts kick in.

33:19.492 --> 33:21.367
- I don't see it.
- Sunny!

33:21.950 --> 33:23.075
Shh!

33:25.242 --> 33:29.533
Lucky... would you like to send
that log into that saw?

33:29.617 --> 33:30.700
Yes, sir.

33:33.992 --> 33:37.075
We want fair wages!

33:37.742 --> 33:39.992
You think you're so superior,

33:40.075 --> 33:43.825
with your fancy optometry degree
and weird hypnosis thing.

33:43.908 --> 33:47.992
Well, I don't need a partner.
I was better off alone,

33:48.075 --> 33:50.908
where my plots were simple
and straightforward

33:50.992 --> 33:54.992
and didn't involve any high-concept
science fiction gimmicks.

33:55.075 --> 33:56.408
Are you breaking up with me again?

33:56.492 --> 33:59.242
No, I'm breaking up with you...
again!

33:59.325 --> 34:00.908
You're being insensitive.

34:00.992 --> 34:03.158
- You're being inor...
- Oh, don't say the word!

34:04.200 --> 34:06.283
- Inordinate.
- An inordinate...

34:07.575 --> 34:09.699
Inordinate! Klaus, inordinate!

34:14.699 --> 34:16.074
Now he's unhypnotized.

34:18.783 --> 34:21.783
How in the world does a child
know a word like "inordinate"?

34:21.867 --> 34:23.992
These brats know all kind of words.
They're book addicts.

34:24.074 --> 34:27.699
But there is still time to cause
an accident and get their fortune!

34:28.408 --> 34:29.742
Oh, no, you can't.

34:30.949 --> 34:33.449
Now put my sister down.

34:33.533 --> 34:35.324
Yes, you may have saved Charles,

34:35.408 --> 34:39.533
but there will still be a fatal accident
at the Lumbermill tonight.

34:39.617 --> 34:41.867
Oh, there you are.

34:41.949 --> 34:45.199
If you want our fortune, you can have it.
Just leave Sunny alone!

34:45.283 --> 34:49.033
You think you're so clever,
but you only see in black and white.

34:49.117 --> 34:51.867
Just like your parents.
They were shortsighted, too.

34:51.949 --> 34:55.949
With their, "You can't hypnotize people!"
And, "What about free will?"

34:56.033 --> 35:00.242
And, "We're going to kick you out
and have your license revoked,

35:00.325 --> 35:01.617
and if we ever have children,

35:01.700 --> 35:03.783
we're never gonna let you
anywhere near them!"

35:03.867 --> 35:05.242
Well, I showed them!

35:05.325 --> 35:07.658
I don't think I can hold them off
much longer, boss!

35:08.617 --> 35:11.533
I'll show everyone!
It was never about the fortune.

35:11.617 --> 35:12.742
- It's about...
- Ah!

35:25.908 --> 35:29.283
Sometimes when we are startled
by a loud noise or an angry mob

35:29.367 --> 35:31.867
looking to confront their hypnotist,
we take a step back.

35:32.950 --> 35:34.283
Dr. Orwell was right.

35:34.367 --> 35:37.908
There was a fatal accident
at the Lucky Smells Lumbermill that night.

35:39.614 --> 35:41.614
Nice catch.

35:59.658 --> 36:02.033
How can anyone run in these things?

36:03.658 --> 36:06.533
- Sorry about the doc, boss.
- Are you kidding? I'm a free man.

36:06.617 --> 36:10.867
I am never taking a partner again.
From now on, Count Olaf works alone!

36:14.700 --> 36:16.783
Can I get a boost?

36:23.700 --> 36:25.283
Oh, careful, careful.

36:28.950 --> 36:30.408
Come on!

36:36.533 --> 36:38.950
You ripped my hem!

36:42.200 --> 36:44.242
I don't recall assigning a night shift!

36:45.367 --> 36:46.867
But I fully approve.

36:47.867 --> 36:50.783
Keep this up and you'll earn
your dorm lights back in no time.

36:50.867 --> 36:53.700
- What do we want?
- Freedom!

36:53.783 --> 36:55.908
Hey. Hey, wait. Hey! Hey!

36:55.992 --> 36:57.950
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

37:10.158 --> 37:12.325
That's it.

37:13.742 --> 37:15.908
Oh, excuse me. Excuse me.

37:16.492 --> 37:18.700
- Cheese.
- Oh!

37:26.533 --> 37:30.492
Hypnosis, child labor,
Count Olaf in a dress!

37:30.575 --> 37:33.867
You children
certainly have lively imaginations.

37:33.950 --> 37:37.158
But a Lumbermill is no substitute
for a proper guardian.

37:37.242 --> 37:40.158
You're fortunate that my wife
is such a great investigative journalist.

37:40.242 --> 37:41.492
How did she find us?

37:43.200 --> 37:45.325
I heard there was an accident
at the Lumbermill,

37:45.408 --> 37:46.658
so I came right away.

37:46.742 --> 37:48.075
So you found us by accident?

37:48.158 --> 37:50.992
- Exactly.
- You're fantastic!

37:51.075 --> 37:53.408
I had to! Trust your instincts.

37:53.492 --> 37:54.867
- Every time. Every...
- Absolutely.

37:56.992 --> 37:59.117
We never found out what caused that fire.

37:59.200 --> 38:01.533
We know it wasn't our parents.

38:01.617 --> 38:03.742
We don't know if Count Olaf
will turn up again.

38:03.825 --> 38:05.992
We know Dr. Orwell won't.

38:07.825 --> 38:10.617
We never solved the mystery
of this photograph.

38:11.450 --> 38:14.408
Oh! Baudelaires...

38:14.492 --> 38:16.450
I want to thank you for saving my life.

38:16.533 --> 38:19.908
Because of your quick thinking,
I only have a small cut on my foot.

38:19.992 --> 38:21.533
You certainly are clever children.

38:21.617 --> 38:24.533
- Are you leaving Paltryville?
- I'm gonna search for Sir.

38:24.617 --> 38:27.867
He may not have been a good partner,
or a good boss...

38:28.575 --> 38:29.450
or a good person...

38:30.200 --> 38:33.283
but someday you'll learn
things aren't always black and white.

38:35.158 --> 38:37.033
Ooh, that reminds me...

38:37.950 --> 38:39.283
I thought you should see this.

38:41.200 --> 38:43.450
Well, tallyho!

38:48.658 --> 38:51.033
"Chapter 12. The Paltryville Fire."

38:51.117 --> 38:52.700
It's a page from Sir's book.

38:52.783 --> 38:55.367
"The Baudelaires
were unequivocally responsible..."

38:55.450 --> 39:00.033
"for putting out the fire and helping
the survivors get back on their feet."

39:09.331 --> 39:11.331
Phil!

39:12.742 --> 39:14.158
Look on the bright side.

39:14.242 --> 39:15.908
You're alive!

39:16.825 --> 39:17.950
Officer.

39:22.033 --> 39:24.742
I think you children
will have a good home here.

39:24.825 --> 39:27.367
I hope so anyway,
because I've just received a promotion.

39:27.450 --> 39:29.658
Vice President of Orphan Affairs.

39:29.742 --> 39:32.200
Which means I'll be too busy
to check in on you orphans.

39:32.783 --> 39:34.033
What's our new guardian's name?

39:34.117 --> 39:36.200
Guardian? Oh, no. Good God, no.

39:36.283 --> 39:38.117
I couldn't find a single one
willing to take you in.

39:38.200 --> 39:41.033
Not after what happened
to the last three. Uh, two.

39:41.117 --> 39:42.700
No, four.

39:42.783 --> 39:44.492
Oh, no, children,
you're going to boarding school.

39:44.575 --> 39:46.950
It's the end of the season,
um, semester,

39:47.033 --> 39:48.992
so you're gonna have to work
very hard to catch up.

39:49.075 --> 39:52.242
It won't be easy,
but I promise you it will build character.

39:55.992 --> 39:57.367
Here's a fun bit of trivia.

39:57.450 --> 40:00.908
The architect who built this school
was severely depressed.

40:04.908 --> 40:07.325
I always wanted to go to boarding school.

40:07.408 --> 40:09.408
Rules, traditions...

40:09.492 --> 40:12.575
Why, I'd give every last suit
just to wear a uniform.

40:18.825 --> 40:21.325
The office is over there.
You can wait on that bench.

40:21.408 --> 40:22.492
You're not coming with us?

40:22.575 --> 40:24.742
Oh, this has already taken up
much too long already.

40:24.825 --> 40:26.575
Banking hours.

40:27.200 --> 40:28.033
Um...

40:28.617 --> 40:30.492
I do want you children to know...

40:35.533 --> 40:38.283
I hope you find comfort here.

40:44.700 --> 40:47.492
Um, this came to the bank for you.
I assume it's junk mail.

40:47.575 --> 40:49.867
I can't imagine that you know
anyone in South America,

40:49.950 --> 40:52.533
or why the return address
is from my secretary.

40:53.742 --> 40:54.908
Um...

40:56.450 --> 40:57.742
So long, Baudelaires.

41:25.617 --> 41:29.325
The statue woman said she'd get it back.
Do you think she'll find us again?

41:29.950 --> 41:32.200
Klaus... we're on our own.

41:35.575 --> 41:37.950
<i>In a world</i>
<i>both frightening and unlucky,</i>

41:38.033 --> 41:39.325
<i>there are a few comforts.</i>

41:39.408 --> 41:41.700
<i>One of them is making new friends.</i>

41:41.783 --> 41:45.158
<i>Friends can make you feel the world
is smaller and safer than it really is,</i>

41:45.242 --> 41:48.117
<i>because you know people
who have similar experiences.</i>

41:48.200 --> 41:49.450
<i>When you meet people like that,</i>

41:49.533 --> 41:52.492
<i>you may find your world
feels a little more complete.</i>

41:53.950 --> 41:55.658
<i>Like the missing piece of a puzzle...</i>

41:56.908 --> 41:59.617
or two halves of a broken spyglass.

42:01.950 --> 42:02.992
Click.

42:25.450 --> 42:29.075
<i># You may think that the Baudelaires
Ought to prevail #</i>

42:29.158 --> 42:33.033
<i># And be tucked some place
All safe and sound #</i>

42:33.117 --> 42:36.450
<i># Count Olaf captured
And rotting in jail #</i>

42:36.533 --> 42:39.908
<i># His henchpeople nowhere around #</i>

42:39.992 --> 42:44.242
<i># But there's no happy endings
Not here and not now #</i>

42:44.325 --> 42:47.783
<i># This tale is all sorrows and woes #</i>

42:47.867 --> 42:51.825
<i># You dream that justice
And peace win the day #</i>

42:51.908 --> 42:56.075
<i># But that's not how the story goes #</i>

42:57.075 --> 43:00.908
<i># You might think that two parents
Both brave and both true #</i>

43:00.992 --> 43:04.492
<i># Would live till a nice ripe old age #</i>

43:04.575 --> 43:08.450
<i># But I'm sad to say
I have bad news for you #</i>

43:08.533 --> 43:11.325
<i># The curtain rings down on the stage #</i>

43:11.992 --> 43:15.867
<i># Yes, there's no happy endings
Not here and not now #</i>

43:15.950 --> 43:19.325
<i>#This tale is all sorrows and woes #</i>

43:19.408 --> 43:23.242
<i># You might dream that justice
And peace win the day #</i>

43:23.325 --> 43:27.700
<i># But that's not how the story goes #</i>

43:29.242 --> 43:32.825
<i># I once loved a girl
And she thought well of me #</i>

43:32.908 --> 43:36.617
<i># We thought we'd be happy together #</i>

43:36.700 --> 43:40.283
<i># But now I'm alone
As you can well see #</i>

43:40.367 --> 43:43.742
<i># And she's cold in her grave forever #</i>

43:47.742 --> 43:51.325
<i># There's no happy endings
Not here and not now #</i>

43:51.408 --> 43:54.783
<i>#This tale is all sorrows and woes #</i>

43:54.867 --> 43:58.908
<i># You might dream that justice
And peace win the day #</i>

43:58.992 --> 44:02.825
<i># But that's not how the story goes #</i>

44:04.783 --> 44:08.575
<i># The world is a pair
Of ill-fitting pants #</i>

44:08.658 --> 44:11.908
<i># And other dire hideous clothes #</i>

44:11.992 --> 44:15.700
<i># You may think that three children
Would lead pleasant lives #</i>

44:15.783 --> 44:19.242
<i># But that's not how the story goes #</i>

44:19.825 --> 44:22.867
<i># Some people smile
At the end of the day #</i>

44:23.533 --> 44:26.658
<i># Some people laugh, I suppose #</i>

44:26.742 --> 44:30.867
<i># But to me there's nothing
But gloom and despair #</i>

44:30.950 --> 44:34.617
<i># That's just how the story goes #</i>

44:34.700 --> 44:36.950
<i># That's just how the story... #</i>

44:59.033 --> 45:01.450
Mmm, that's nice.
