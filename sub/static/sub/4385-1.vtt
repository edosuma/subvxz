00:47.297 --> 00:49.716
Okay, what we're
getting now is, yes,

00:49.800 --> 00:52.260
they're saying it was, in
fact, a fire that erupted

00:52.344 --> 00:54.262
inside the external tank
of the ship

00:54.346 --> 00:57.348
exactly 98 seconds after it
entered the asteroid field.

00:57.433 --> 00:59.100
No one is sure
what caused the fire

00:59.184 --> 01:00.810
which led to
the massive explosion

01:00.894 --> 01:02.979
killing all 12
crew members and scientists

01:03.063 --> 01:04.897
aboard the space
shuttle Deliverance,

01:04.982 --> 01:07.608
taking with them our
last and only hope.

01:07.693 --> 01:09.402
Once again,
if you're just tuning in,

01:09.486 --> 01:11.195
the CSA space shuttle
Deliverance

01:11.280 --> 01:12.321
has been destroyed.

01:12.406 --> 01:15.241
The final mission to
save mankind has failed.

01:15.325 --> 01:18.494
The 70-mile-wide asteroid
known commonly as "Matilda"

01:18.579 --> 01:21.831
is set to collide with Earth
in exactly three weeks' time,

01:21.915 --> 01:23.916
and we'll be bringing you
up-to-the-minute coverage

01:24.001 --> 01:26.127
of our countdown
to the end of days,

01:26.211 --> 01:29.046
along with all your
classic rock favorites.

01:29.131 --> 01:30.798
This is Q107.2.

01:34.303 --> 01:36.429
I think we missed the exit.

02:14.593 --> 02:16.511
They say the damage
to the tower has rendered

02:16.595 --> 02:19.222
all cellular
telephones useless.

02:19.306 --> 02:21.432
No word yet on how long
before water and power

02:21.517 --> 02:22.850
will be shut off altogether.

02:22.935 --> 02:24.977
But we'll be bringing you
all the information you need

02:25.062 --> 02:26.562
just as long as
we have a live feed.

02:26.647 --> 02:29.649
And be sure to stay tuned at
9:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time

02:29.733 --> 02:31.234
for the End of the World
Awareness Concert.

02:31.401 --> 02:34.821
The human migration
continues...

02:39.952 --> 02:41.911
- Sorry, dude!
- It's okay.

02:48.585 --> 02:50.169
What are you doing?

02:50.254 --> 02:51.921
Hey, up yours, pal!

03:16.746 --> 03:17.363
I'm sorry, sir,

03:17.447 --> 03:18.948
that's not covered
under your current policy.

03:21.118 --> 03:24.245
I'm afraid the Armageddon
package is extra, yes.

03:26.331 --> 03:27.874
Well, that protects you
and your family

03:27.958 --> 03:30.418
against any sort of
apocalyptic disaster.

03:30.502 --> 03:33.838
Asteroids, obviously,
plague, famine, locusts...

03:36.383 --> 03:38.050
Drawbacks?

03:39.303 --> 03:40.553
The premiums are high...

03:42.639 --> 03:46.475
I'm sorry... Can you just hold
on for one moment? Thank you.

03:49.054 --> 03:50.938
So feel free to wear

03:51.023 --> 03:55.651
your casual Friday clothing
pretty much any day of the week.

03:56.486 --> 04:00.990
And since Ted in Human
Resources is no longer with us,

04:03.827 --> 04:09.332
I thought I'd let you all know of
a few positions in upper management

04:09.416 --> 04:11.834
that have been made available.

04:12.502 --> 04:17.589
So, if anyone wants to be
Chief Financial Officer...

04:18.841 --> 04:20.843
CFO? Anyone?

04:21.178 --> 04:23.971
Life has no meaning.

04:24.056 --> 04:25.181
Anyone?

04:25.265 --> 04:27.808
I really think I'm coming
down with something.

04:29.353 --> 04:30.728
On your right!

04:32.606 --> 04:33.606
On your right, buddy.

04:33.690 --> 04:34.732
On your right!

05:06.264 --> 05:08.057
You could have
told me that yesterday!

05:20.487 --> 05:21.946
Linda?

05:23.573 --> 05:25.074
Oh, hi, Elsa.

05:25.909 --> 05:27.284
Hi, Mr. Dodge.

05:27.911 --> 05:29.829
- Okay, I finish.
- Okay.

05:32.290 --> 05:35.292
Me estoy volviendo vieja,
Mr. Dodge. I getting older.

05:35.377 --> 05:38.254
I didn't mean to rush
you off or anything.

05:42.259 --> 05:44.510
Do you have someplace to be?

05:46.346 --> 05:48.597
I mean, if you want,
you could...

05:49.182 --> 05:51.600
I don't know,
you could watch TV here,

05:53.186 --> 05:55.146
or something,
whatever you like.

05:55.772 --> 05:57.356
Oh, my kids are waiting.

05:57.441 --> 05:59.608
Oh, right. Of course.
You have kids.

06:01.611 --> 06:03.946
Listen, Elsa, you don't
have to come next week.

06:04.656 --> 06:09.285
Or, you know, ever, if you
don't want to. It's okay.

06:10.287 --> 06:11.537
You firing me?

06:11.621 --> 06:13.372
No, no, no. No, I just...

06:13.498 --> 06:15.041
Is this because
I don't watch TV with you?

06:15.125 --> 06:18.044
No. No. I...

06:18.795 --> 06:20.546
I just thought, considering...

06:24.134 --> 06:27.178
There's just no need to...

06:32.142 --> 06:34.185
Nothing. Forget it. It's fine.

06:37.314 --> 06:38.314
You're out of Windose.

06:38.982 --> 06:40.524
More Windose, got it.

06:42.486 --> 06:43.652
See you next week, Mr. Dodge.

06:43.820 --> 06:44.945
Okay.

06:45.030 --> 06:46.739
I regret my entire life.

06:46.823 --> 06:48.032
- Okay.
- Okay.

06:48.116 --> 06:49.408
- Bye!
- Bye, now.

06:49.493 --> 06:51.410
Well, it's no longer
just the postal service.

06:51.995 --> 06:55.623
Commercial airlines have
discontinued altogether today.

06:55.707 --> 06:58.501
After much delay, the final
flight, piloted by Delta Airlines,

06:58.585 --> 07:01.253
left Chicago Midway
at 3:45 Central Time,

07:01.338 --> 07:03.422
touching down in
Seattle at 6:15 Pacific.

07:03.507 --> 07:05.633
Private charters have been
given military clearance

07:05.717 --> 07:08.677
to use intercontinental
airspace at their own risk.

07:09.721 --> 07:11.722
And now
the traffic report. Amy?

07:12.432 --> 07:13.933
We're fucked, Bob.

07:14.684 --> 07:16.393
Thank you, Amy.

07:22.526 --> 07:24.735
Oh, shit.

07:47.384 --> 07:49.844
They have yet to make
a statement regarding rumors

07:49.928 --> 07:52.847
of a classified space launch for
high-ranking government officials,

07:52.931 --> 07:55.015
religious figureheads,
and important contributors

07:55.100 --> 07:57.393
to athletics and entertainment.

07:57.894 --> 08:00.354
They have predicted
the exact location of impact,

08:00.438 --> 08:03.524
but the government is refusing to
release this information to the public

08:03.608 --> 08:06.318
to avoid creating an even
greater sense of panic.

08:29.842 --> 08:31.760
- Oh! You're early!
- Hi.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.179
Warren told me about Linda.

08:34.264 --> 08:35.264
Oh, yeah...

08:35.347 --> 08:37.933
I am so surprised
she didn't do it sooner.

08:39.436 --> 08:40.936
She never really looked happy,

08:41.020 --> 08:42.605
especially when
she was with you.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.565
That's new information.

08:44.649 --> 08:46.066
Really?

08:46.151 --> 08:47.735
Why do you think she
didn't want to have kids?

08:49.446 --> 08:50.696
Karen Amalfi is
coming alone tonight.

08:50.780 --> 08:52.239
Don't. Do not.

08:52.324 --> 08:53.824
Do not what?

08:54.284 --> 08:57.536
Please, Warren. Can we just
have a few sober moments tonight?

08:59.247 --> 09:01.874
This is the Last Supper, Diane.

09:01.958 --> 09:04.710
You think Jesus was sober
for his last supper?

09:04.794 --> 09:06.545
You think he turned
water into lemonade?

09:06.630 --> 09:09.048
Dodge, a little help, please.

09:09.132 --> 09:11.383
No, no, no, no, no.
Dodge is my friend.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.844
My friend.
Look at this, my friend.

09:15.472 --> 09:17.473
This is a Don Ramon cigar.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.226
This is the hardest
cigar in the world...

09:20.310 --> 09:23.312
Can you chop those
a little louder, please?

09:24.564 --> 09:26.941
This is the hardest cigar
in the world to find.

09:27.025 --> 09:30.194
And tonight, I'm going to share
one of my last 13 with you.

09:31.029 --> 09:32.529
How's that sit?

09:35.200 --> 09:36.242
Hi, Danny.

09:36.326 --> 09:38.077
Hey, can I fix you
a drink, son?

09:38.161 --> 09:40.204
Quit ruining my life.

09:40.747 --> 09:43.332
Good for you, sweetie. Express yourself.

09:43.416 --> 09:44.500
Go fuck yourself!

09:45.043 --> 09:46.502
I was thinking
maybe we should set up

09:46.586 --> 09:48.462
Dodge with Karen.
Don't you think?

09:48.838 --> 09:51.006
Oh, my God, will you stop it?

09:51.675 --> 09:52.675
What?

09:52.759 --> 09:55.594
He doesn't want to get set up
with one of your gross friends.

09:55.679 --> 09:57.137
He needs to meet somebody!

09:57.222 --> 09:58.347
No, he doesn't!

09:58.390 --> 10:00.140
- Leave him alone.
- He is alone, look at him.

10:00.225 --> 10:01.934
- I'm fine.
- No, honey, you're not fine.

10:02.018 --> 10:04.353
You're gonna die alone.
Doesn't that bother you?

10:04.437 --> 10:06.105
- He's not gonna die alone.
- Yes, he is.

10:06.189 --> 10:09.316
He's not gonna die alone.
He's gonna die with everybody else!

10:09.801 --> 10:11.860
There's just no need
to cling to who's closest.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.530
This isn't
the fucking Ark, Diane.

10:15.991 --> 10:17.616
This is the Titanic!

10:19.209 --> 10:22.496
And there is not
a life raft in sight.

10:26.258 --> 10:27.876
Welcome aboard.

10:29.462 --> 10:32.172
Dodge, you remember
Karen Amalfi.

10:32.257 --> 10:33.257
Hello, good to see you.

10:33.341 --> 10:34.717
Hi.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.226
It's everything I never wore.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.649
It's very nice, very shiny.

10:54.321 --> 10:55.821
You're funny.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.327
So...

11:06.624 --> 11:08.125
Well...

11:09.586 --> 11:13.839
We decided that we would use
this time to be with family.

11:13.923 --> 11:17.009
First we're gonna go to
West Virginia, see my sister

11:17.093 --> 11:20.179
and her husband
and the two boys.

11:20.263 --> 11:22.514
Even though we just saw them.

11:22.599 --> 11:24.308
We just saw them.

11:24.392 --> 11:29.855
And then Lacey wants to go
to her stepfather's in Aspen

11:29.939 --> 11:32.608
so that she can
tell him to fuck off.

11:33.443 --> 11:34.985
And also ski!

11:35.612 --> 11:36.653
And ski.

11:36.738 --> 11:38.447
- Great!
- Yeah.

11:39.115 --> 11:40.240
Karen?

11:44.621 --> 11:49.208
Okay, well, I think I'm finally
gonna take that pottery class.

11:49.292 --> 11:52.711
And... Well, I'm gonna
eat whatever I want,

11:52.796 --> 11:55.631
and totally
not even care. Just...

11:56.841 --> 11:58.300
Go, girl.

11:59.636 --> 12:01.637
And maybe I'll...

12:03.640 --> 12:07.226
be spending a little time
with someone special.

12:12.982 --> 12:14.149
Yeah.

12:14.651 --> 12:16.568
Oh, me? Let's see...

12:18.696 --> 12:19.738
What was the question?

12:25.495 --> 12:27.162
Qué será, será!

12:28.164 --> 12:31.250
We're gonna ski first,
and then she's gonna tell...

12:31.334 --> 12:35.170
Drink! Drink!
Drink! Drink! Drink!

12:36.339 --> 12:39.007
Fight through the burn, fight through
the burn! Fight through the burn!

12:54.065 --> 12:55.665
Yes!

12:59.320 --> 13:00.446
Winner's wine!

13:02.740 --> 13:04.158
- Hey, Dodge!
- Hey, Roache.

13:04.242 --> 13:08.745
Dodger! I'm gonna miss you, man.
Gonna miss you...

13:09.873 --> 13:12.791
Oh, boy. It's the fucking
Wild West, you know?

13:12.876 --> 13:14.209
- Is it?
- Come on.

13:14.711 --> 13:18.714
Single guys like us, I mean, we
gotta grab this thing, you know?

13:18.798 --> 13:21.884
Because it is
a different world now.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.302
It's a different world.

13:23.386 --> 13:25.137
- Okay.
- We gotta... You know?

13:25.221 --> 13:26.722
No, I don't. I don't...

13:26.806 --> 13:28.807
- I don't...
- You don't? Dude,

13:29.601 --> 13:31.059
the sky is falling.

13:31.728 --> 13:33.228
The sky is falling.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.899
<i>And it's raining pussy!</i>

13:38.776 --> 13:40.652
<i>It's raining pussy</i>

13:40.737 --> 13:43.238
Dude, ever since
Deliverance, man,

13:43.323 --> 13:46.200
I've been with a
different girl every day.

13:46.284 --> 13:48.368
And they don't care
about getting pregnant.

13:48.453 --> 13:51.205
They don't care about diseases,

13:51.289 --> 13:52.414
or are you gonna
call them back,

13:52.499 --> 13:53.832
or can you provide for them,

13:53.917 --> 13:57.044
or do you have a small dick,

13:57.128 --> 14:00.172
or are you related. All right?

14:00.256 --> 14:03.592
And it's like the apocalypse...

14:03.676 --> 14:07.054
The apocalypse has
leveled the field, man.

14:07.138 --> 14:11.183
Oh, my God.
Do you want to double-stuff that cookie?

14:11.267 --> 14:14.895
<i>Do you want to double-stuff
that cookie with me?</i>

14:14.979 --> 14:17.814
<i>Two chefs in the kitchen</i>

14:17.941 --> 14:21.276
<i>We're double-stuffing the
cookie Dodge and Roache</i>

14:21.361 --> 14:25.572
You guys, look!
Sarah and Dave brought heroin.

14:25.657 --> 14:28.408
- It's time.
- Bucket list! Bucket list!

14:28.493 --> 14:31.328
Wait, where's Lacey?
Let Lacey do it, she's a dental assistant.

14:31.412 --> 14:32.746
- I'll do it.
- Yeah, you do it, Lace.

14:32.830 --> 14:34.081
Here we go.

14:34.165 --> 14:35.499
Don't grab, Roache.

14:35.667 --> 14:38.210
Let's watch her, let's
everyone watch her do it.

14:38.294 --> 14:39.378
Put some Radiohead on.

14:39.462 --> 14:41.129
I want to do heroin
to Radiohead.

14:41.464 --> 14:44.091
Yeah! Yeah!

14:44.175 --> 14:47.010
This is dynamite!
Everybody, run!

14:48.471 --> 14:51.098
I'm kidding! It's not.

14:51.182 --> 14:53.976
It can't hurt you unless you
get about this close to it.

15:04.988 --> 15:06.405
Are you hiding?

15:07.282 --> 15:08.407
Yes.

15:11.828 --> 15:14.830
You don't have to do heroin
if you don't want to, sweetie.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.415
Look, I tried.

15:16.499 --> 15:19.418
I just can't spend the last month
of my life getting to know someone.

15:19.502 --> 15:20.502
It's ridiculous.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.506
You don't like Karen?

15:25.508 --> 15:27.342
I couldn't
possibly give a shit.

15:27.885 --> 15:31.805
I'm not gonna sit across from
someone and hear all their stories,

15:31.889 --> 15:34.474
even if she was someone
I could be interested in,

15:34.559 --> 15:36.602
because I just...

15:36.894 --> 15:40.647
I'm not sure that the month
between my wife leaving me

15:40.732 --> 15:44.443
and the end of the world
sounds like good timing. Do you?

15:44.527 --> 15:47.362
What... Hey... What are you
doing? What are you doing?

15:47.447 --> 15:49.031
What?

15:49.115 --> 15:50.782
- What?
- What?

15:50.867 --> 15:52.993
You're Warren's.

15:53.286 --> 15:54.453
No, I'm not.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.206
Nobody's anybody's
anything anymore.

16:06.716 --> 16:09.134
Why did Linda get to disappear?

16:11.804 --> 16:15.015
Why does everybody else
get to do what they want?

16:16.809 --> 16:18.894
I don't know what I want.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.736
You can't run from this, Dodge.

17:46.858 --> 17:48.316
Hello?

17:55.533 --> 17:56.992
You okay?

17:58.577 --> 17:59.286
No.

18:02.540 --> 18:04.583
How could I be so stupid?

18:07.003 --> 18:09.212
I don't know.
I don't know you very well.

18:09.338 --> 18:12.340
I'm never gonna
see my family again.

18:13.509 --> 18:15.761
I missed the planes,
all of them.

18:16.554 --> 18:20.682
I mean, God, it's the end of the
world and I'm still 15 minutes late.

18:21.350 --> 18:24.019
I can hear my father say it now.
I can hear him say,

18:24.103 --> 18:26.855
"Flaky and irresponsible,"
and he's right.

18:27.523 --> 18:31.151
How could I do this?
I put my energy in the wrong places,

18:31.235 --> 18:32.778
I give my time to
the wrong people.

18:32.862 --> 18:34.196
I mean,
when I think of all the...

18:34.280 --> 18:36.782
All the holidays I didn't
spend with my mum and dad

18:36.866 --> 18:39.284
to be with some guy
I used to know.

18:41.871 --> 18:43.872
Would you like to come in?

18:51.964 --> 18:54.132
I won't steal anything
if you don't rape me.

18:55.885 --> 18:57.219
Agreed.

19:09.065 --> 19:10.148
My name's Penny.

19:10.233 --> 19:11.274
I'm Dodge.

19:14.237 --> 19:16.112
How long have you lived here?

19:16.239 --> 19:18.156
Three years. You?

19:19.242 --> 19:21.368
I just broke up with someone.

19:21.452 --> 19:22.911
Oh, I'm sorry.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.162
No, I mean...

19:24.247 --> 19:25.997
You know,
it was building to this.

19:26.082 --> 19:29.417
He's just taking the night
to clear out his stuff.

19:30.253 --> 19:31.878
I mean, it's always better
to sleep on the fire escape

19:31.963 --> 19:34.089
than have pity sex,
I always say.

19:37.510 --> 19:38.927
What's that?

19:39.428 --> 19:42.347
What? Oh, that is cough
syrup with codeine.

19:42.431 --> 19:44.850
- Splash of vodka.
- Can I have a sip?

19:44.934 --> 19:46.685
Actually, I'm feeling a little...

19:47.937 --> 19:49.062
You want some weed?

19:50.273 --> 19:51.731
Oh, no, thank you.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.442
It's the only thing
that sends me to sleep

19:54.527 --> 19:56.361
and the only thing
that wakes me up again.

19:57.145 --> 19:57.863
I mean, seriously,

19:57.947 --> 19:59.489
I've got a wicked
case of hypersomnia.

19:59.574 --> 20:00.949
I mean, I could sleep
through the apocalypse.

20:09.959 --> 20:11.960
- Who's the girl?
- Who?

20:12.461 --> 20:14.629
Oh. That's Olivia.

20:15.506 --> 20:17.299
Is she the one that got away?

20:18.718 --> 20:21.553
Well, they all got away,
but she was the first, yeah.

20:23.014 --> 20:24.764
Are you gonna go
and get her back?

20:25.892 --> 20:28.059
I'm sure she has
enough on her plate.

20:30.646 --> 20:32.063
And what is it about
the end of the world

20:32.148 --> 20:33.815
that brings them
all out of the woodwork?

20:54.045 --> 20:55.629
There he's got it.

20:55.713 --> 20:59.549
Yeah.
He changed his mind, as he...

21:02.011 --> 21:04.638
doing a terrific
job of cutting him off.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.599
Now coming from behind,

21:07.683 --> 21:10.518
he's got him around the
shoulders, and down goes...

22:01.404 --> 22:03.905
I'm ready to go downstairs now.

22:13.916 --> 22:15.000
Wait here a tick.

22:15.084 --> 22:16.251
Okay.

22:23.634 --> 22:26.720
He's gone. Took my Pet Sounds with
him. I should've seen that coming.

22:30.599 --> 22:34.602
So...

22:36.397 --> 22:37.856
What are you doing
with the rest of your life?

22:40.192 --> 22:42.110
Little of this, little of that.

22:42.194 --> 22:45.196
Probably catching
up on some "me" time.

22:46.282 --> 22:47.699
Find God.

22:47.783 --> 22:49.617
Maybe move around some chairs.

22:51.287 --> 22:54.205
Well, maybe I'll run into
you at a support group

22:54.290 --> 22:55.373
or an orgy or something.

22:55.458 --> 22:56.958
Yeah, that sounds nice.

22:59.462 --> 23:00.462
What's that?

23:00.546 --> 23:01.713
That's your mail.

23:01.964 --> 23:03.548
Why do you have it?

23:03.632 --> 23:06.384
Oh, you know how the mailman
would sometimes put the mail

23:06.469 --> 23:07.719
In the wrong box?

23:07.803 --> 23:10.972
Well, over time, say like...
Well, three years, I mean, it...

23:11.557 --> 23:12.974
God, it really
adds up, doesn't it?

23:14.560 --> 23:16.269
Isn't it funny?
I mean, how we've lived

23:16.353 --> 23:18.229
so close and
we've never said hi.

23:18.314 --> 23:20.482
Oh, but I did meet
your roommate a few times.

23:20.566 --> 23:22.233
My roommate? You mean Linda?

23:22.318 --> 23:25.445
Linda. Linda, right. And her
boyfriend, what was his name?

23:25.529 --> 23:28.239
Oh, God, they seemed so happy
together. What was his name?

23:28.324 --> 23:30.283
I haven't seen them in a
while. Are they all right?

23:30.367 --> 23:31.910
What was his name again?

23:34.789 --> 23:36.289
I forget.

24:01.524 --> 24:02.816
$8.50.

24:48.529 --> 24:49.988
Come on.

25:31.906 --> 25:33.239
Give it to me! I'll hit it!

25:33.324 --> 25:34.782
Fuck, yeah! Hit it!

25:59.767 --> 26:02.101
What started as a few
individuals acting out

26:02.186 --> 26:04.437
has quickly escalated
into a massive riot

26:04.521 --> 26:06.689
sweeping through
the streets of downtown.

26:06.774 --> 26:08.983
If we could show
the live footage, Dory?

26:09.902 --> 26:11.402
Dory?

26:11.987 --> 26:14.072
You see people using
every available weapon,

26:14.156 --> 26:16.157
looting, smashing windows,

26:16.242 --> 26:18.952
setting fires, and in some
cases, attacking one another.

26:19.995 --> 26:21.246
With the lack of
police presence,

26:21.330 --> 26:23.957
we are seeing people
with nothing left to lose.

26:25.918 --> 26:27.877
They appear to be
moving off Main Street

26:27.962 --> 26:29.671
and heading towards
Division Avenue,

26:29.755 --> 26:32.507
where residences and
businesses are more at risk.

26:33.926 --> 26:35.593
And perhaps
it's only a matter of time

26:35.678 --> 26:38.137
before the city is
too dangerous to inhabit.

26:48.816 --> 26:50.483
Oh, my God.

26:55.322 --> 26:56.990
Oh, God.

27:05.124 --> 27:06.541
Oh, God.

27:08.127 --> 27:09.711
Okay. Okay.

27:12.840 --> 27:17.135
Oh, Sorry. Okay.
Good, Sorry. Here we go.

27:18.137 --> 27:19.554
Come on.

27:24.393 --> 27:25.893
Penny?

27:31.900 --> 27:33.735
Penny! Penny?

27:34.903 --> 27:36.738
- Penny!
- Who the fuck are you?

27:37.322 --> 27:39.324
Oh, shit! I'm sorry.

27:39.408 --> 27:40.575
I'm sorry. I'm Dodge,
I live upstairs.

27:40.659 --> 27:41.993
I've never seen you before.

27:42.077 --> 27:43.661
We've run into each other a
few times, but that's not...

27:43.746 --> 27:45.913
I'm pretty good with faces.

27:46.749 --> 27:49.375
Anyway... Obviously,
there's a riot going on.

27:49.835 --> 27:53.171
Maybe you heard the
screaming, smelled the burning.

27:53.255 --> 27:54.464
If you could
just wake up Penny,

27:54.548 --> 27:56.507
I think we should get out of
the building as soon as possible.

27:56.592 --> 27:57.967
Jesus.

27:59.928 --> 28:01.304
You're fucking her, aren't you?

28:01.388 --> 28:03.848
What? No... What? No, I'm...

28:03.932 --> 28:05.016
No. I'm not.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.142
Oh, I knew it!

28:07.394 --> 28:09.020
I knew it.

28:10.356 --> 28:11.773
Fuck! I knew it!

28:14.068 --> 28:15.193
Shit!

28:16.077 --> 28:16.694
Okay, all right.

28:16.779 --> 28:18.821
Penny! Come on,
here we go. Wake up.

28:18.906 --> 28:19.947
There you go.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.032
Hey! I decide
when Penny wakes up!

28:21.116 --> 28:22.533
This isn't what it looks like.

28:22.618 --> 28:23.701
I broke my hand, baby.

28:23.786 --> 28:25.870
I hope you're happy.
It's my guitar hand.

28:25.954 --> 28:27.455
Aren't they both
your guitar hands?

28:27.539 --> 28:29.665
Penny, there's a small riot brewing
and we need to go, right now!

28:29.750 --> 28:31.084
She's not going
anywhere with you...

28:31.168 --> 28:32.502
Would you please just stop?

28:32.586 --> 28:35.713
We all need to go! Come on! Here we go!
Here we go, guys! Come on!

28:35.798 --> 28:38.800
My hand! My gift.
Will you just look at it? I broke it.

28:40.067 --> 28:40.927
This is the guy?

28:41.011 --> 28:42.720
I can't believe you want
this creep instead of me.

28:42.805 --> 28:45.056
Hey! Hey! I'm not kidding!
Let's do it!

28:45.140 --> 28:46.599
Oh, he's old!

28:46.725 --> 28:49.227
He's not even good-looking.
What, do you have a job?

28:49.311 --> 28:50.895
- Mister Job?
- Owen!

28:50.979 --> 28:53.815
I told you there wasn't anybody else.
Oh, shit, my records.

28:54.817 --> 28:57.318
So you broke up
with me for nobody?

28:57.403 --> 28:59.028
Do you not see
how that's worse?

28:59.113 --> 29:00.696
We don't have time for this.

29:00.781 --> 29:02.949
Scott Walker, Wilco...
John Cale!

29:03.033 --> 29:04.158
Hey, that's my Cale.

29:04.243 --> 29:05.993
We don't have time
for any of this, guys!

29:06.829 --> 29:08.079
Goodbye, friends!

29:08.163 --> 29:09.414
Come on.

29:09.498 --> 29:10.748
Give me that Cale.

29:10.833 --> 29:11.916
Okay, here we go.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
I'll drive.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.002
- All right, all right.
- Hey!

29:15.421 --> 29:16.838
Watch out for my hand.

29:16.922 --> 29:18.297
Here we go.

29:20.676 --> 29:22.093
I can't believe you're
breaking up with me now.

29:22.177 --> 29:23.594
It's the worst timing
for me, ever!

29:23.679 --> 29:24.804
We didn't get back together.

29:24.930 --> 29:26.597
- What do you call last night?
- Nothing happened!

29:26.682 --> 29:28.349
Since when is
snuggling nothing?

29:28.475 --> 29:30.101
Shit. I thought
it was right there.

29:30.185 --> 29:31.269
You don't remember
where you parked?

29:31.353 --> 29:32.437
No, it was... It was on...

29:32.521 --> 29:34.897
It was on 1st and 9th.
Fuck, maybe it was 10th and 2nd?

29:34.982 --> 29:36.274
- This way.
- It could have been 3rd...

29:36.358 --> 29:38.526
It was definitely one
of those combinations.

29:38.610 --> 29:40.611
I'm the asshole, right?
Everything's my fault?

29:40.696 --> 29:42.113
Can we just concentrate
on finding the car?

29:42.197 --> 29:43.781
No, Owen, it's not about that.

29:43.866 --> 29:45.032
I'm just saying
that we're not a match.

29:45.117 --> 29:47.201
I mean, isn't it better we
find out now, rather than later?

29:47.703 --> 29:48.744
No!

29:48.829 --> 29:50.746
What do you mean,
not soul mates?

29:50.831 --> 29:52.665
I love you.
I want to take care of you.

29:55.335 --> 29:57.044
Just get...

29:57.671 --> 29:59.213
Penny, let's go, come on!

30:00.716 --> 30:02.216
- Owen?
- Come on!

30:07.389 --> 30:09.682
You okay?
Come on! Go for the car.

30:13.562 --> 30:15.062
There it is!

30:16.148 --> 30:18.399
Is this because
you pay my rent?

30:18.525 --> 30:20.485
Because I had to swallow a lot
of pride to let you do that.

30:20.569 --> 30:22.028
Get in the car, Owen.

30:24.239 --> 30:25.323
I'm not leaving the city.

30:25.407 --> 30:26.407
Well, it's my car.

30:26.492 --> 30:28.451
Oh, that's right,
I don't have a car.

30:28.535 --> 30:29.952
Throw that in my face
while you're at it.

30:30.037 --> 30:31.162
They're right on top of us!

30:31.246 --> 30:32.288
"They're right on top of us!"

30:32.372 --> 30:34.290
- Would you get out and help?
- I'll do it!

30:34.374 --> 30:36.125
No, no, no.
No, no, no. I'll do it.

30:36.210 --> 30:37.168
Just...

30:37.252 --> 30:39.795
Oh, God, there's a guy.
There's a guy right there!

30:39.880 --> 30:41.881
Cut the wheel! Cut it!

30:42.382 --> 30:44.008
What are you doing?
Cut the wheel!

30:44.092 --> 30:45.843
- I'm...
- Cut the wheel!

30:45.928 --> 30:47.887
- Fire! Fire!
- There's fire!

30:47.971 --> 30:48.971
You're not cutting at all!

30:49.256 --> 30:51.474
Are you freaking blind?

30:51.558 --> 30:52.558
God, here they come!

30:52.643 --> 30:53.768
What is wrong with you?

30:54.937 --> 30:57.438
Hey! Hey!
I know a guy with a plane.

30:57.523 --> 31:00.775
If you drive me to where I need to
go, I can get you to your family.

31:00.859 --> 31:03.110
Hello? Cut the wheel!

31:05.364 --> 31:07.406
That's it. Now come
forward a little bit.

31:09.159 --> 31:10.368
He'll be fine!

31:11.620 --> 31:13.120
Hey!

31:16.208 --> 31:17.708
So tell me about this plane.

31:32.182 --> 31:34.892
You know, hybrid cars
don't need as much gas.

31:34.977 --> 31:37.979
Yes. They still need
a little gas, don't they?

31:38.063 --> 31:41.774
No, I'm just saying, you don't
have to fill them up as much.

31:43.986 --> 31:46.237
Does this mean we're
not going to the plane?

31:46.321 --> 31:49.574
Look, maybe you should
just forget about the plane.

31:50.450 --> 31:52.243
I left Owen in
the middle of a riot.

31:52.327 --> 31:54.078
He used you as
a human shield, Penny.

31:54.162 --> 31:56.247
You don't even know him.

31:56.665 --> 31:59.208
Look, you're the one who woke
me up in the middle of the night,

31:59.334 --> 32:00.793
dragged me out of bed...
You're right.

32:00.877 --> 32:03.921
I don't know why I bothered saving
your life, after you ruined mine.

32:04.006 --> 32:05.965
What is that supposed to mean?

32:09.720 --> 32:11.387
What? What is that?

32:11.972 --> 32:13.848
Well, you know how
sometimes the mailman

32:13.932 --> 32:15.766
would put the mail
in the wrong box?

32:15.851 --> 32:18.436
Well, sometimes, the girl
that you never got over

32:18.520 --> 32:19.604
sends you a letter.

32:19.688 --> 32:21.689
That's from the girl? My God.

32:22.232 --> 32:23.899
Oh, my God!
That's great, right?

32:23.984 --> 32:25.401
Yeah, it's pretty good.

32:25.485 --> 32:28.988
What would be great is if I could
call her from a regular phone,

32:29.072 --> 32:31.449
or I could just hop
on a train to wherever,

32:31.533 --> 32:33.451
or not die in
the outer suburbs.

32:33.535 --> 32:36.078
But instead,
I am on the scenic route

32:36.163 --> 32:38.956
to the guillotine
with you, and you.

32:41.376 --> 32:44.211
She could be at the
fucking pyramids by now.

32:44.838 --> 32:47.006
She could have blown her
head off, and I wouldn't know,

32:47.090 --> 32:49.091
because I didn't get this

32:49.176 --> 32:50.718
three annoying months ago!

32:54.598 --> 32:55.890
Now I feel bad.

32:58.226 --> 32:59.977
Fuck. Look,
guilt isn't a feeling

33:00.062 --> 33:01.312
that I'm comfortable with.

33:02.397 --> 33:05.650
Well, fortunately you won't
have long to live with it.

33:11.698 --> 33:13.240
What are you doing?

33:13.325 --> 33:14.825
Penny, this really
doesn't involve you.

33:14.910 --> 33:17.119
I said I was gonna get you there,
I'm gonna get you there, so...

33:17.204 --> 33:18.663
Where was the last place
you saw her?

33:18.747 --> 33:20.373
Where was she 18 years ago?

33:21.208 --> 33:23.000
Look, you don't need to spend
the last few days of your life

33:23.085 --> 33:24.126
with a total stranger.

33:24.211 --> 33:26.504
You're not a total stranger,
and these aren't my last days.

33:26.588 --> 33:27.797
Oh, you're a survivalist.

33:27.881 --> 33:29.757
No, I'm not a survivalist.
I'm an optimist.

33:30.258 --> 33:31.634
- Hello!
- You having some trouble?

33:31.760 --> 33:33.719
Do you know where the
nearest gas station is?

33:33.804 --> 33:36.263
Yeah, but diesel is all they got left.
Where you headed?

33:37.224 --> 33:38.432
Where we headed, Dodge?

33:40.602 --> 33:41.811
Somerset.

33:42.479 --> 33:44.230
Somerset. Wherever that is.

33:44.940 --> 33:46.941
I think Huntsville
might be as far as I'm going.

33:47.025 --> 33:49.068
Great! Thank you!

34:03.250 --> 34:05.126
So, what's your pilgrimage?

34:05.210 --> 34:07.002
Because everybody's
headed somewhere.

34:07.087 --> 34:09.964
Well, I'm going to see
my family, and he's...

34:10.799 --> 34:12.466
He's looking for someone.

34:12.842 --> 34:14.176
Who is it you're looking for?

34:15.011 --> 34:16.512
His high school sweetheart.

34:16.596 --> 34:18.139
Is that right?

34:18.264 --> 34:19.681
Well, there's no greater search

34:19.766 --> 34:21.641
than that of lost love,
I'll give you that.

34:22.143 --> 34:23.476
- You married?
- No, darling,

34:23.603 --> 34:26.938
I never did walk the plank.
There was a special lady.

34:27.815 --> 34:30.192
My Rita passed
seven years back.

34:31.402 --> 34:33.237
You know, it's all about
who you lay down with

34:33.321 --> 34:34.362
when the lights go out.

34:34.447 --> 34:37.074
Takes longer than it
should to figure that part.

34:37.159 --> 34:42.204
Truth is, it's nice to have
some company for a change.

34:42.289 --> 34:43.414
Even strangers.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.751
Why don't you
tell us your life story?

34:46.835 --> 34:48.418
Then we won't be
strangers anymore.

34:48.503 --> 34:49.503
Yeah?

34:49.588 --> 34:53.340
Well, sure. Let's see.
I was born in...

34:54.176 --> 34:58.804
Wait a minute. I should probably
tell Daddy's life story first,

34:58.889 --> 35:00.806
- so there's some context.
- Okay.

35:01.516 --> 35:03.184
- Uptime?
- Groovy!

35:04.186 --> 35:06.937
Yeah. Daddy was born
in Skokie, Illinois.

35:07.689 --> 35:10.816
And his dad was born in Okie.
Used to catch bass.

35:11.693 --> 35:13.152
So they run a bunch of tests

35:13.236 --> 35:15.196
and they all come back
with the same bad news.

35:15.280 --> 35:17.490
Doctors give me
six months to live.

35:17.574 --> 35:20.993
Then I go home, turn on the
TV, and they say three weeks.

35:21.077 --> 35:23.245
If you ask me, a man is not
supposed to know when his time is up,

35:23.330 --> 35:24.955
it's not natural.

35:25.040 --> 35:27.708
That's when you find yourself
renting a gun and buying a bullet.

35:28.210 --> 35:30.586
But that ain't
no way into heaven.

35:31.379 --> 35:32.546
Isn't that right, Dodge?

35:34.925 --> 35:36.383
No, I guess not.

35:37.677 --> 35:39.804
I'm gonna go drain the snake.

35:39.888 --> 35:41.222
You wanna join me?

35:43.266 --> 35:44.767
No, thanks, I'm good.

35:53.235 --> 35:56.028
Okay, what a fucking weirdo.

35:57.012 --> 35:58.030
I think he's soulful.

35:58.114 --> 36:01.659
Who drives around with shovels?
I don't trust him.

36:02.244 --> 36:05.538
Glen? What?
He told us his life story.

36:05.622 --> 36:07.998
Yes, and thank you
for that, by the way.

36:08.083 --> 36:10.793
Do you know, if you actually
listened, you might learn something.

36:12.003 --> 36:13.045
Sorry needs to go out.

36:13.129 --> 36:14.713
I'll go. I will take him.

36:14.798 --> 36:17.883
I'm gonna take him for a sniff.
Don't go anywhere.

36:28.103 --> 36:29.728
I knew it as soon as I saw you.

36:31.314 --> 36:35.818
That detached look in your eyes.
That vague way about you.

36:38.446 --> 36:39.697
You almost had me
fooled with that line

36:39.781 --> 36:40.906
about your
high school girlfriend.

36:42.784 --> 36:43.868
I'm sorry, I don't...

36:43.952 --> 36:45.286
Don't be sorry, son.

36:47.497 --> 36:49.123
Just kill me quickly.

36:50.125 --> 36:51.542
What?

36:51.626 --> 36:53.252
Well, I thought we could
do it in that nice field,

36:53.336 --> 36:55.671
but if you're gonna shoot me in the
back, then let's get it over with.

36:55.755 --> 36:58.757
Shoot you? I don't...
Are we still speaking metaphorically?

36:58.842 --> 37:03.095
Well, what's it gonna be, then?
Knife? Piano wire?

37:03.179 --> 37:05.180
Okay, you know what?
She's gonna be back any second.

37:05.265 --> 37:07.266
Don't tell me they sent
a girl to do a man's job.

37:07.350 --> 37:09.143
I specifically
requested a male!

37:09.603 --> 37:11.478
Unless you're some sort of team!
Is that how this works?

37:11.563 --> 37:14.815
Okay, you know what?
I don't think I am who you think I am.

37:23.491 --> 37:25.701
Well, that's a relief.

37:25.785 --> 37:29.204
Because I was afraid
I could fight you off!

37:31.124 --> 37:34.209
You know, Dodge, when a man...

37:41.009 --> 37:42.593
Dodge? Glen?

37:44.846 --> 37:46.055
Oh, my God.

37:46.723 --> 37:48.098
Glen's dead.

37:48.642 --> 37:51.560
Are you okay?
Did you get the plates?

37:55.482 --> 37:57.191
"When a man..."

37:58.360 --> 38:01.487
"When a man..." What do you
think he was trying to say?

38:01.571 --> 38:03.280
I don't know, Penny.

38:03.365 --> 38:04.990
"When a man..."

38:05.700 --> 38:07.159
Loves a woman?

38:08.036 --> 38:10.329
"When a man..." Is a trucker?

38:10.413 --> 38:12.247
The man...

38:12.332 --> 38:14.625
The man committed
suicide via homicide

38:14.709 --> 38:16.919
two weeks before
the apocalypse.

38:17.003 --> 38:19.004
I'm not really concerned
with any Road Warriorwisdom

38:19.089 --> 38:21.882
I may have missed out on. Okay?

38:22.550 --> 38:24.009
All right.

38:24.678 --> 38:27.346
I'll drive.
Do you have the keys?

38:32.852 --> 38:34.228
Okay.

38:35.730 --> 38:36.605
Okay.

38:44.739 --> 38:46.865
You'd think a lifetime of
waiting for the worst to happen

38:46.950 --> 38:48.951
would have
prepared me for this.

38:49.619 --> 38:52.204
How could anyone
prepare for this?

38:53.456 --> 38:56.750
I always knew.
I always knew it'd be over too soon.

38:57.919 --> 38:59.253
I never saw myself
as an old man.

38:59.629 --> 39:00.838
Really?

39:01.756 --> 39:06.760
I thought I was gonna live forever.
Was totally gonna peak at 40.

39:10.306 --> 39:12.266
Well, I hear 30 is the new 40.

39:16.604 --> 39:20.899
Luckily, I'm getting my mid-life
crisis in just under the wire.

39:21.776 --> 39:24.737
She must be really special, Olivia?

39:26.114 --> 39:27.865
To want to find her
after so much time.

39:28.950 --> 39:30.325
She was, yeah.

39:30.744 --> 39:32.411
So why did you break up?

39:33.288 --> 39:37.166
We were young.
We were not fully formed beings yet.

39:38.168 --> 39:40.377
Life just took us
in different directions.

39:40.462 --> 39:41.962
She dumped you?

39:43.423 --> 39:44.640
Yes.

39:45.967 --> 39:47.301
What about you?

39:47.469 --> 39:48.761
What about me?

39:48.845 --> 39:50.387
Who's the one that got away?

39:50.513 --> 39:52.306
I am, thank God.

39:52.599 --> 39:54.725
I don't mean I'm anything
special, I just...

39:54.809 --> 39:59.021
I'm glad that part of my life's
over with, you know? Relationships.

39:59.981 --> 40:01.440
I thought you weren't cynical.

40:01.566 --> 40:03.025
I'm not cynical. I'm...

40:04.152 --> 40:05.194
I'm clinical.

40:06.112 --> 40:08.822
I am a recovering
serial monogamist.

40:09.324 --> 40:10.616
Sounds very serious.

40:10.700 --> 40:11.950
Very serious.

40:12.035 --> 40:13.702
I went to this
therapist who told me

40:13.787 --> 40:15.662
that I had problems
being alone.

40:15.997 --> 40:18.207
But then, I mean, she wanted
to see me five times a week,

40:18.291 --> 40:20.167
so you tell me
who had the real problem.

40:20.960 --> 40:23.754
You know, if the end of the
world has taught me anything,

40:23.838 --> 40:26.131
it's that I'm finally
getting my...

40:26.216 --> 40:27.716
Oh, my God.

40:29.552 --> 40:30.812
Is that a Friendsy's?

40:31.971 --> 40:33.639
I would kill for a pint.

40:42.690 --> 40:45.192
Hi, welcome to Friendsy's,
where everyone's your friend!

40:45.693 --> 40:47.194
- Hi!
- Hi!

40:48.696 --> 40:51.406
Two for dinner? Yeah!

40:51.491 --> 40:52.574
Look at this little guy.

40:52.659 --> 40:53.659
Is this okay?

40:53.743 --> 40:55.494
Oh, yeah!
Everyone's welcome, yeah.

40:55.578 --> 40:58.247
Dude brought in a wolf
last week. It's crazy!

40:58.331 --> 40:59.331
Come on in!

40:59.457 --> 41:00.499
Okay.

41:01.042 --> 41:02.126
Taquitos!

41:02.210 --> 41:03.293
Yeah, three orders.

41:03.378 --> 41:04.962
I can't believe
you guys are still open.

41:05.046 --> 41:06.797
Yeah, we thought about
closing up shop,

41:06.881 --> 41:10.509
but then we realized this is
really our family, you know?

41:10.593 --> 41:13.929
In fact, the tragedy has brought us closer.
Some of us too close.

41:14.013 --> 41:15.347
That's impossible.

41:15.431 --> 41:17.349
And under new management,
it's a lot less corporate.

41:17.433 --> 41:18.475
Right, Steven?

41:19.060 --> 41:21.603
Right. I hope a booth is okay.

41:21.688 --> 41:22.646
Yeah, it's...

41:22.730 --> 41:24.231
We burned all the chairs in a bonfire.

41:24.899 --> 41:26.984
I'm gonna pass you
off to Katie, okay?

41:27.068 --> 41:29.987
You're in warm hands with her.
My skin feels great!

41:30.071 --> 41:32.322
Thanks, Darcy.
Isn't he incredible?

41:32.407 --> 41:34.032
Hi, I'm Katie.

41:34.117 --> 41:35.409
Can you slide over, please?

41:35.493 --> 41:36.702
Yeah.

41:36.786 --> 41:38.745
- Can I touch your hair?
- Yeah.

41:38.830 --> 41:41.456
- Oh, it's so soft.
- Thank you.

41:41.541 --> 41:44.418
Can I get you guys something
to wet your whistle?

41:44.502 --> 41:45.669
Everything's awesome!

41:45.753 --> 41:47.671
- How are your mudslides?
- Fucking awesome!

41:47.755 --> 41:49.590
- Can we get two mudslides?
- Yes.

41:49.674 --> 41:50.674
Thank you.

41:50.758 --> 41:52.509
Do you guys wanna
know the specials?

41:52.594 --> 41:54.261
Because these guys are
getting really creative.

41:54.845 --> 41:56.346
No, just the mudslides.

41:58.975 --> 42:02.895
Okay! Gotcha.
Guys, I'm rolling pretty hard right now,

42:02.979 --> 42:05.022
but if you two
keep it super positive,

42:05.106 --> 42:06.857
I will bring you
those M-slides.

42:06.941 --> 42:09.902
And maybe an order of
spin-dip for the table.

42:09.986 --> 42:13.363
That is amazing! And you know what,
it's his birthday today.

42:13.448 --> 42:16.450
Why didn't you tell me that?
Happy birthday!

42:17.752 --> 42:18.535
Thank you.

42:23.124 --> 42:24.541
I really hope you're
having a good time.

42:24.626 --> 42:25.709
Yeah, I am having fun.

42:25.793 --> 42:29.046
I think that this place
is some sort of cult

42:29.130 --> 42:30.380
and we probably
shouldn't eat anything.

42:30.465 --> 42:32.216
Oh, you're crazy.
This is amazing.

42:32.300 --> 42:35.219
Look, people are sitting down
together, everybody's happy. Hey!

42:35.303 --> 42:37.262
There's a conga line.
Just like...

42:37.347 --> 42:41.058
This is a piece of American history.
It's a human landmark.

42:41.142 --> 42:43.477
It's a shout-out to
the man upstairs to say... Oh!

42:44.345 --> 42:46.730
I smell weed.
Excuse me! I smell weed.

42:46.814 --> 42:49.775
Yeah, it's right this way.
Conga your way to a great time!

43:03.539 --> 43:04.957
Is it good?

43:05.083 --> 43:06.500
This bun is a donut.

43:08.628 --> 43:11.588
It's exactly what
you think a burger

43:11.673 --> 43:14.091
with a donut bun
would taste like.

43:17.136 --> 43:18.845
What did you do?

43:18.972 --> 43:19.930
When?

43:20.014 --> 43:22.391
You know, before,
like, as a living.

43:22.684 --> 43:24.351
I sold insurance.

43:26.688 --> 43:28.188
That's...

43:30.316 --> 43:31.858
- Oh, you're serious.
- Yes, I am.

43:33.695 --> 43:37.656
Okay. How does...
How does somebody get into that field?

43:38.199 --> 43:39.817
You dare to dream, Penny.

43:40.201 --> 43:42.202
I don't know, you...

43:42.829 --> 43:46.039
I guess you start with all
of your childhood fantasies

43:46.124 --> 43:47.958
of being a fireman

43:48.042 --> 43:50.627
or an athlete or whatever.

43:50.712 --> 43:52.462
And then eventually
reality hits,

43:52.547 --> 43:55.257
and you realize that,
really, all you want

43:55.383 --> 43:59.261
is to have a desk somewhere
with your name on it.

43:59.345 --> 44:00.429
But why insurance?

44:00.513 --> 44:01.555
I didn't like law,

44:01.639 --> 44:04.308
and the economy was
headed in one direction.

44:04.392 --> 44:05.976
I'm the type of person,
I just...

44:06.060 --> 44:08.437
I feel more comfortable
with a safety net.

44:12.517 --> 44:13.817
Yeah.

44:13.901 --> 44:17.070
So, go on.
How do you know a man with a plane?

44:17.530 --> 44:19.197
I don't know him.
I said I knew him.

44:19.282 --> 44:22.451
I know, I know.
I'm not getting my hopes up. I'm just...

44:22.535 --> 44:24.745
I'm just really excited.

44:25.913 --> 44:27.164
Obviously.

44:27.248 --> 44:29.458
<i>With the Friendsy's family</i>

44:29.542 --> 44:31.835
<i>It's your very last birthday</i>

44:31.919 --> 44:33.378
<i>Happy birthday!</i>

44:33.796 --> 44:35.422
<i>There'll never be another</i>

44:35.882 --> 44:37.591
<i>So tell all your
sisters and brothers</i>

44:38.092 --> 44:40.093
<i>It's your very last birthday</i>

44:41.304 --> 44:43.805
Happy birthday!

44:49.145 --> 44:51.396
Okay...

44:52.273 --> 44:54.316
That's... All right.

44:56.319 --> 44:57.736
- Hi, buddy.
- Hi, there.

44:57.820 --> 44:59.488
Can I join in?

45:00.073 --> 45:01.323
Look, I don't
wanna be rude, but...

45:01.407 --> 45:02.407
Oh, God!

45:02.492 --> 45:03.992
Yeah, we should go.
We should go.

45:04.410 --> 45:05.994
Okay. Sorry.

45:06.579 --> 45:08.121
Here's some money.

45:08.456 --> 45:10.123
- Oh!
- All right. Come on, let's go.

45:10.249 --> 45:14.002
All right, see you soon!
Okay, have a good night.

45:16.130 --> 45:17.589
Let's get these off.

45:30.937 --> 45:32.396
They were...

45:36.818 --> 45:39.444
Oh, God.

45:52.834 --> 45:56.378
Dodge,
I want you to be my last.

45:58.840 --> 46:00.757
That's a lot of pressure.

46:20.695 --> 46:22.237
Listen, I...

46:22.321 --> 46:24.448
Sorry, you go first.

46:24.532 --> 46:25.866
I wasn't saying anything.

46:26.409 --> 46:27.409
It's just...

46:28.578 --> 46:31.580
I think I got a little
carried away before with

46:33.374 --> 46:36.042
the mudslides and the orgy,

46:36.127 --> 46:41.047
and, you know, obviously, things
are very complicated right now.

46:42.216 --> 46:43.508
What are you doing?

46:43.593 --> 46:45.010
I just want you
to know that I...

46:45.219 --> 46:47.804
I wasn't trying
to take advantage.

46:49.348 --> 46:53.310
Obviously, you're very young.
What are you, like 30? 31?

46:53.394 --> 46:56.897
- Twenty-eight.
- Oh, God. Oh!

46:58.900 --> 47:00.484
God, you try to be
a good person...

47:00.568 --> 47:02.194
Relax, Dodge. It was...

47:03.237 --> 47:05.739
It was end-of-the-world sex.
It was creature comfort.

47:05.865 --> 47:07.199
- Well...
- If anything, it was my fault.

47:07.283 --> 47:08.283
You didn't do anything.

47:08.367 --> 47:09.576
I think I did some things.

47:09.911 --> 47:11.870
It isn't gonna happen again, I promise.

47:11.954 --> 47:14.331
You've got Olivia,
I've got my family.

47:14.415 --> 47:16.666
You know, we both have
more important places to be.

47:16.751 --> 47:18.335
Just... A little sex.
It was bound to happen,

47:18.419 --> 47:20.128
let's not make
a big deal out of it.

47:21.130 --> 47:22.923
I dated someone from Camden.

47:23.591 --> 47:26.051
Listen, Penny, it...

47:30.973 --> 47:32.057
I don't understand.

47:32.141 --> 47:33.266
What is he doing?

47:33.434 --> 47:35.560
I guess he's...
Is he trying to pull us over?

47:35.645 --> 47:37.062
Oh, come on.
He can't be serious.

47:37.146 --> 47:38.355
How fast are you going?

47:38.439 --> 47:39.481
Who gives a shit?

47:39.565 --> 47:40.524
Why aren't you slowing down?

47:40.608 --> 47:41.650
I think we can take him.

47:41.734 --> 47:43.777
Hey! Hey! Hey! Slow down!

47:43.861 --> 47:45.612
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

47:45.696 --> 47:47.155
- Slow down! Pull the car over.
- Come on.

47:47.240 --> 47:48.990
Don't you think that he must
have better things to do?

47:49.075 --> 47:50.200
Penny, pull the car over.

47:50.284 --> 47:51.660
Jesus, what's he
gonna do, shoot us?

47:51.744 --> 47:54.079
There's a very real possibility
he could shoot us, yes!

47:54.163 --> 47:55.372
- All right! All right!
- Let's pull it over.

47:55.456 --> 47:57.874
All right! God, but...

47:57.959 --> 48:00.168
But I should warn you,
my dad's ex-military

48:00.253 --> 48:02.754
and he says I have a really
serious problem with authority.

48:02.838 --> 48:05.090
Put that away, please.
Give that.

48:05.174 --> 48:06.466
No, it's all I've got left

48:06.592 --> 48:08.176
and I'm trying to ration it.
Come on.

48:08.636 --> 48:09.719
What do I do with it?

48:09.804 --> 48:11.304
Oh, just...
Just put it in your mouth.

48:15.560 --> 48:16.643
That was still lit.

48:21.357 --> 48:23.775
Hello, Officer, what
seems to be the problem?

48:23.859 --> 48:25.652
Well, for starters,

48:25.736 --> 48:28.738
you're driving about 15 miles
an hour over the speed limit.

48:28.823 --> 48:30.865
Really?

48:30.950 --> 48:32.659
I thought I was making
better time than that.

48:34.120 --> 48:37.080
And you know,
you got a tail light out.

48:37.164 --> 48:38.832
- No.
- Yeah.

48:39.667 --> 48:43.295
Also, your plates
expired about a month ago.

48:43.713 --> 48:45.338
Go on.

48:46.173 --> 48:49.509
That's it. That's everything.

48:50.136 --> 48:51.261
Those three things.

48:51.345 --> 48:52.929
Well, why don't you
write us out

48:53.014 --> 48:55.473
any number of expensive,
time-sensitive tickets,

48:55.558 --> 48:57.517
and we'll be on our way?

48:59.562 --> 49:01.104
I need some identification.

49:01.188 --> 49:02.939
Of course. My name is Penny,

49:03.024 --> 49:04.149
and this is Dodge.

49:04.233 --> 49:05.233
Hi.

49:05.985 --> 49:08.111
Okay. License and registration.

49:08.195 --> 49:09.654
Well, you see, that's
where we've got a problem,

49:09.739 --> 49:13.241
because I didn't get a chance
to retrieve my identification

49:13.326 --> 49:15.452
before fleeing my home
during a deadly riot.

49:15.536 --> 49:17.454
However, we were
fortunate enough

49:17.538 --> 49:19.581
to hitch a ride with
a very nice trucker,

49:19.665 --> 49:22.959
who, turns out, had hired a hit
man to assist him in a suicide,

49:23.044 --> 49:24.628
thus bestowing us with this...

49:24.712 --> 49:26.296
This beautiful mode
of transportation.

49:26.380 --> 49:31.801
So, the answer is no, no
license or registration here.

49:32.553 --> 49:36.056
However, given the current
situation with the...

49:39.602 --> 49:41.269
Couldn't you find it
in your heart

49:41.354 --> 49:43.146
to set aside the law
just this once

49:43.230 --> 49:46.191
and let us on our way, so
that I can give my friend here

49:46.275 --> 49:48.485
a fighting chance of
being with the one he loves

49:48.569 --> 49:51.571
before we all reach
our untimely conclusion?

49:59.288 --> 50:00.497
No.

50:03.584 --> 50:04.959
All right.

50:05.753 --> 50:08.338
Oh, excuse me,
do we get a phone call?

50:08.422 --> 50:09.381
No, phones are dead.

50:09.465 --> 50:10.465
Okay.

50:10.549 --> 50:11.966
Have fun.

50:13.969 --> 50:17.222
Hello? What are you in for?

50:18.099 --> 50:19.099
Disturbing the peace.

50:19.983 --> 50:20.684
Brilliant.

50:21.936 --> 50:23.645
Well, might as well
get comfortable.

50:23.729 --> 50:25.397
This is as good
a place to die as any.

50:27.066 --> 50:28.441
I ruined your life.

50:29.151 --> 50:30.610
No, you didn't.

50:31.779 --> 50:33.738
Oh, yes, I did.

50:34.490 --> 50:37.992
I ruined my life,
and I took you down with me.

50:38.077 --> 50:41.454
I was a terrible neighbor,
and I'm a...

50:42.123 --> 50:43.790
I'm an awful daughter.

50:44.458 --> 50:46.251
Hey. Hey.

50:58.222 --> 50:59.931
Look at him.

51:00.558 --> 51:03.810
Sound asleep in his sandwich board.
You know why?

51:04.353 --> 51:06.438
'Cause he always knew
the end was near.

51:07.106 --> 51:08.940
And he's currently
not surprised.

51:10.484 --> 51:13.027
You are looking at
a vindicated man.

51:14.238 --> 51:15.947
How come you're not
with your family?

51:17.116 --> 51:18.742
I don't really have any.

51:20.828 --> 51:22.495
What do you mean?

51:24.790 --> 51:26.624
My mother passed away,

51:27.960 --> 51:32.130
and my father drove away
a long time ago.

51:32.798 --> 51:37.010
My wife recently ran away, as
fast as any human woman could.

51:38.512 --> 51:40.764
It only took Armageddon
to give her the courage.

51:40.848 --> 51:43.057
Which is ironic, because

51:46.228 --> 51:50.064
being afraid of dying alone is why
I got married in the first place.

51:51.817 --> 51:53.234
Your roommate was your wife.

51:55.362 --> 51:56.738
My wife was my roommate.

51:58.365 --> 51:59.824
Should have listened
to my mother.

52:00.451 --> 52:03.995
Even after she got sick, she
always made the most sense.

52:05.039 --> 52:07.040
You would have liked her.

52:09.210 --> 52:10.919
She would have liked you, too.

52:11.921 --> 52:13.379
You think so?

52:15.591 --> 52:17.133
She died alone.

52:17.968 --> 52:20.094
Guess it doesn't matter now.

52:21.514 --> 52:23.056
How long since
you've seen your dad?

52:24.558 --> 52:26.392
Twenty-five years?

52:26.477 --> 52:29.979
Twenty-five years?

52:31.273 --> 52:33.566
Well, don't you have
anything to say to him?

52:33.651 --> 52:35.109
Nothing good.

52:36.612 --> 52:38.279
Well, what about Olivia?

52:39.073 --> 52:42.534
We were together
on and off for ten years.

52:42.618 --> 52:45.078
She wanted to get married.
I didn't pull the trigger.

52:45.746 --> 52:47.247
Somebody else did.

52:47.331 --> 52:51.543
And then I met Linda, and
the rest is almost history.

52:51.627 --> 52:55.171
What did she say,
Olivia, in her letter?

52:55.256 --> 52:57.549
She said she and her
husband had gotten divorced,

52:57.633 --> 53:00.552
and that she had a
6-year-old son named Marcus,

53:00.636 --> 53:02.345
and she asked about my parents,

53:03.264 --> 53:04.806
and she said she missed me.

53:05.474 --> 53:09.853
You know, garden-variety "end
of the world" mumbo jumbo.

53:11.605 --> 53:13.189
I did ruin your life.

53:13.274 --> 53:14.816
No, you didn't.

53:16.026 --> 53:17.569
I had a really long head start.

53:21.991 --> 53:24.117
Oh, man, I don't feel good.

53:26.620 --> 53:28.288
Is that the weed kicking in?

53:29.331 --> 53:30.790
What does it feel like?

53:30.875 --> 53:32.208
Feels like
I'm falling off a cliff

53:32.293 --> 53:33.793
with a bomb
strapped to my chest.

53:34.837 --> 53:36.296
Well, that could be anything.

54:13.834 --> 54:15.335
Damn it, Wally!

54:16.754 --> 54:19.047
There you go.
Look who's here. Look who's here.

54:19.173 --> 54:20.340
Hey, hey, hey. Come here.

54:20.424 --> 54:21.591
There you go.

54:22.843 --> 54:24.260
Well, sorry, folks,

54:24.345 --> 54:27.805
but Wally's been taking the
quota pretty serious these days,

54:27.890 --> 54:30.516
and I'm afraid that...

54:31.101 --> 54:32.894
Well, your truck was impounded.

54:34.188 --> 54:36.940
Is there some place
I can drop you folks?

54:38.192 --> 54:39.233
Delaware.

54:40.361 --> 54:42.111
Yeah... No.

54:43.572 --> 54:45.531
How far is it to Camden?

54:46.700 --> 54:48.534
No matter where
the impact occurs,

54:48.619 --> 54:50.870
it will create a firestorm
that will wipe out all life.

55:02.132 --> 55:03.549
Thank you!

55:08.222 --> 55:09.514
So how long
were you with this guy?

55:09.640 --> 55:10.890
Total?

55:11.475 --> 55:13.226
Nine months, plus six more.

55:14.728 --> 55:16.145
How do you know
he's going to be here?

55:17.564 --> 55:18.940
He's always here.

55:29.118 --> 55:30.576
There he is.

55:36.500 --> 55:37.792
Penny.

55:37.876 --> 55:39.127
Hey, Speck.

55:41.630 --> 55:44.465
Oh, my goodness.

55:48.036 --> 55:49.387
I knew you'd come back.

55:49.471 --> 55:51.347
No, I'm not back. I...

55:51.432 --> 55:52.932
We were just
in the neighborhood.

55:53.058 --> 55:54.517
I haven't seen
this girl in 12 months

55:54.601 --> 55:56.853
and she's just
in the neighborhood.

55:56.937 --> 55:58.229
Lance Corporal James Speck.

55:58.355 --> 55:59.689
Speck, this is Dodge...

55:59.773 --> 56:01.566
Lieutenant Colonel
Dodge Petersen.

56:01.650 --> 56:03.526
Look, we're in
a bit of a pickle,

56:03.610 --> 56:06.154
and I was hoping that
you could help us out.

56:06.947 --> 56:08.948
Helping you out of a pickle
should be my middle name.

56:09.283 --> 56:10.283
Na-hah!

56:13.287 --> 56:15.621
Come on.
Bring your little amigo.

56:17.041 --> 56:18.791
You have to leave
the dog up top.

56:18.876 --> 56:20.710
Mom just vacuumed
the bomb shelter.

56:21.712 --> 56:23.629
Come on,
I'll show you the digs.

56:24.465 --> 56:25.631
Fellas.

56:25.758 --> 56:26.883
Hey.

56:27.051 --> 56:28.176
That's Entertainment.

56:31.680 --> 56:33.139
Sports and Recreation.

56:34.808 --> 56:36.100
And if nature calls...

56:36.518 --> 56:37.560
Hey.

56:39.688 --> 56:41.773
As you can see,
we have enough rations

56:41.857 --> 56:44.484
to live down here comfortably
for a good six months.

56:45.027 --> 56:47.904
These walls are 12
inches of pure titanium.

56:50.190 --> 56:51.491
Yeah, I was going to say 11.

56:52.076 --> 56:53.868
Resurfacing won't be that easy.

56:53.994 --> 56:55.828
The world will need
a strong leader.

56:56.830 --> 56:58.289
Is that a satellite phone?

56:58.373 --> 57:00.416
It is. You want to
call your folks?

57:01.251 --> 57:02.251
What?

57:02.336 --> 57:04.921
Yeah, I was talking
to your dad the other day.

57:05.005 --> 57:07.340
What time is it
across the pond, 1600?

57:07.883 --> 57:08.966
I don't know.

57:20.896 --> 57:22.355
Mum?

57:24.024 --> 57:25.483
It's me.

57:25.567 --> 57:28.236
Yeah, yeah, no, no, no.
I'm fine. We got out.

57:29.571 --> 57:31.489
Me and a friend.

57:34.034 --> 57:36.077
Yeah, he is.

57:39.915 --> 57:41.374
Hi, Dad.

57:45.796 --> 57:47.547
I miss you like crazy.

57:50.050 --> 57:55.221
Tell me everything.
How's the garden? Is everyone there?

57:57.141 --> 57:59.934
Is that Benny?
Yeah, yeah. Put him on.

58:05.732 --> 58:07.567
Oh, you twat.

58:08.443 --> 58:11.070
No. You're mental.

58:13.740 --> 58:15.116
Oh, my God.

58:16.827 --> 58:18.077
Oh, I hear the baby.

58:20.998 --> 58:22.623
Is that my niece?

58:24.334 --> 58:25.793
Yeah.

58:27.087 --> 58:28.921
She sounds beautiful.

58:31.175 --> 58:33.009
What did you name her?

58:45.105 --> 58:48.441
You have a lot of guns
and a lot of potato chips.

58:51.945 --> 58:53.821
Yeah, gotta be safe.

58:55.866 --> 58:57.950
So how long
you known our Penny?

58:58.035 --> 58:59.452
About a week.

59:01.079 --> 59:02.580
Give or take.

59:02.664 --> 59:04.248
So what's your pitch?

59:04.333 --> 59:05.541
My pitch?

59:05.626 --> 59:07.460
'Cause let me tell you
something about that girl.

59:07.544 --> 59:10.129
She may be a romantic
on the outside,

59:10.214 --> 59:12.632
but on the inside
she's all survivor.

59:13.508 --> 59:17.053
And she knows her
best chance of survival

59:17.137 --> 59:19.472
is sitting right here,
and I'm talking about me.

59:20.807 --> 59:22.934
Can we restart civilization without her?

59:23.018 --> 59:24.477
Sure.

59:25.187 --> 59:28.189
But she deserves to be one of the
top quality females in contention.

59:30.651 --> 59:32.985
There's no room for you, dude.

59:33.362 --> 59:34.820
That's okay.

59:35.572 --> 59:37.782
Got a pretty good lead
on a school desk.

59:40.160 --> 59:41.702
There she is.

59:41.787 --> 59:42.828
We should go.

59:43.205 --> 59:44.455
I thought you were staying.

59:44.915 --> 59:47.833
I promised I'd take him
somewhere. Can we...

59:48.877 --> 59:50.336
Can we borrow one
from the fleet?

59:55.717 --> 59:58.010
Are you sure you don't want
a fallout tablet for the road?

59:58.095 --> 59:59.845
That's okay, thanks.

01:00:03.074 --> 01:00:04.892
The car's a loan, Penny.

01:00:05.519 --> 01:00:08.271
I want to see it back
here with you in it.

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:20.783
Thank you.

01:00:21.702 --> 01:00:23.202
For everything.

01:00:25.122 --> 01:00:27.248
I should have married you.

01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:29.458
When?

01:00:31.044 --> 01:00:33.212
When you would've said yes.

01:00:41.888 --> 01:00:42.888
Dodgy-Dodge.

01:00:44.224 --> 01:00:45.599
Keep her out of trouble.

01:00:52.274 --> 01:00:53.733
You okay?

01:00:55.569 --> 01:00:57.236
They sounded good.

01:00:59.781 --> 01:01:01.741
They sounded really good.

01:01:21.928 --> 01:01:23.929
My dry cleaner.

01:01:24.814 --> 01:01:26.098
Meatball subs at Zuzu's.

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.772
Ducks pond in the summertime.

01:01:33.648 --> 01:01:35.066
Riding the subway.

01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:38.194
Oh, you lost me there.
Nobody misses the subway.

01:01:38.278 --> 01:01:40.696
No, I did some of my best
people-watching on the subway.

01:01:42.532 --> 01:01:44.533
How about things that
we are not going to miss?

01:01:44.618 --> 01:01:47.286
Like going to the dentist.

01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:50.081
Dr. Hoberman.

01:01:50.749 --> 01:01:53.542
Oh, my God.

01:01:54.211 --> 01:01:56.504
Dr. Hoberman.

01:02:30.288 --> 01:02:31.705
That's it.

01:02:32.999 --> 01:02:35.334
I cannot tell you how
many hours I spent out here

01:02:35.419 --> 01:02:37.086
obsessing over that window.

01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:38.170
Which window?

01:02:38.255 --> 01:02:39.255
Right there.

01:02:40.715 --> 01:02:42.508
That's a good window.

01:02:44.168 --> 01:02:45.636
I don't think anybody's home.

01:02:46.346 --> 01:02:48.180
Oh, come on, we have to try.

01:02:49.006 --> 01:02:50.850
I'll be right here
if you need me.

01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:17.710
Nobody's home.

01:03:17.878 --> 01:03:18.878
Try the knob.

01:03:26.261 --> 01:03:27.720
You know what,
she's definitely not here.

01:03:29.264 --> 01:03:33.225
Well, we've driven all this way

01:03:33.894 --> 01:03:36.562
and it has definitely
not been in vain.

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:39.398
You know what?
I think there's a hide-a-key.

01:03:39.483 --> 01:03:42.067
Okay, here we...

01:03:44.905 --> 01:03:46.447
Go.

01:03:47.741 --> 01:03:49.450
You are insane.

01:03:51.077 --> 01:03:52.203
Come on.

01:04:04.257 --> 01:04:07.092
Looks the same.
Smells the same.

01:04:07.928 --> 01:04:10.012
So what are we looking for?

01:04:10.096 --> 01:04:12.181
Something with
an address, I guess.

01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:21.190
Oh, my God!

01:04:21.274 --> 01:04:22.441
What? What?

01:04:22.526 --> 01:04:25.694
We have exactly the same
wallpaper in our kitchen!

01:04:26.379 --> 01:04:27.279
Don't do that, please.

01:04:27.364 --> 01:04:28.864
Isn't that wild?

01:04:31.284 --> 01:04:33.994
Okay.

01:04:38.959 --> 01:04:41.627
Oh. Oh, I love this house.

01:04:47.342 --> 01:04:49.552
And I can make
something with this.

01:04:49.636 --> 01:04:51.804
I'll go check the bedrooms.

01:04:51.888 --> 01:04:54.974
Yeah, we used to break into
people's houses when we were kids,

01:04:55.058 --> 01:04:56.392
me and my brothers.

01:04:56.476 --> 01:04:58.561
I mean, we wouldn't
steal anything.

01:04:58.645 --> 01:05:01.647
We'd just eat their ice
cream and watch cable.

01:05:10.874 --> 01:05:12.575
Then this one time, Benny,

01:05:12.659 --> 01:05:14.743
who must've been
about, like, seven,

01:05:14.828 --> 01:05:16.453
he took off all his clothes

01:05:16.538 --> 01:05:18.122
and he got onto this old
man's exercise bike...

01:05:18.206 --> 01:05:19.248
Penny?

01:05:55.109 --> 01:05:57.369
How long was I out?

01:05:57.454 --> 01:05:59.538
Couple of hours.
Think you needed it.

01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:03.042
Well, I've lost a third
of my life to sleep,

01:06:03.126 --> 01:06:04.460
what's another couple of hours?

01:06:04.544 --> 01:06:05.669
Can you grab the wine?

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:06.920
Yeah.

01:06:11.926 --> 01:06:13.669
Okay, so explain this to me.

01:06:14.054 --> 01:06:16.847
You picked the tomatoes,
you made the sauce.

01:06:17.641 --> 01:06:19.350
You went out and
harvested the wheat.

01:06:19.434 --> 01:06:21.477
Yes, I harvested the wheat.

01:06:21.561 --> 01:06:23.354
That was actually good.

01:06:23.438 --> 01:06:25.648
I don't know.
It was the best I could do,

01:06:25.732 --> 01:06:30.027
but just imagine a big juicy
ham instead of the canned beets.

01:06:30.195 --> 01:06:31.737
Perfect.

01:06:33.406 --> 01:06:35.991
How could anyone
abandon this face?

01:06:36.076 --> 01:06:37.868
Look at that little face.

01:06:37.952 --> 01:06:41.413
Look, look, he's got
bits of gray in his beard.

01:06:41.498 --> 01:06:42.665
Highlights.

01:06:45.418 --> 01:06:48.170
What'd you do? Before.

01:06:48.254 --> 01:06:49.963
I think you could
say that I dabbled.

01:06:50.965 --> 01:06:52.132
How did you learn
to cook like this?

01:06:53.635 --> 01:06:56.178
I watched everything my mum
did and did the exact opposite.

01:06:57.597 --> 01:06:59.348
My dad had the real talent,

01:06:59.432 --> 01:07:01.350
and my mum was
sort of a cheerleader.

01:07:03.603 --> 01:07:06.438
You've never seen
two people more in love.

01:07:07.107 --> 01:07:08.649
I think that's the reason
I can never settle

01:07:08.733 --> 01:07:10.025
for anything less than amazing.

01:07:10.485 --> 01:07:12.945
You know?
They made it look so easy.

01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:17.658
There's a reason that opposites
are supposed to attract.

01:07:18.827 --> 01:07:21.370
I'm the result of two
romantics getting together.

01:07:21.454 --> 01:07:23.038
I'm totally screwed.

01:07:25.542 --> 01:07:27.960
I love this song.

01:07:30.964 --> 01:07:34.091
I can't believe I nearly
never heard it again.

01:07:34.968 --> 01:07:36.885
You know, this was the
first record I ever got.

01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:40.055
I stole it from my dad's collection.
Pretended that he didn't know,

01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:42.474
and then I'd hear him
whistling it the whole time.

01:07:42.559 --> 01:07:43.793
Just to torture me.

01:07:44.477 --> 01:07:45.894
Is that how you
got into records?

01:07:45.979 --> 01:07:48.147
Yeah, he started it, but...

01:07:50.483 --> 01:07:53.819
I don't know, I just...
I love records.

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:56.488
I mean, they're not
for everyone, you know?

01:07:56.573 --> 01:07:58.741
You really have to
take care of vinyl.

01:07:58.825 --> 01:08:01.785
It's very delicate,
it can get wrecked so easily.

01:08:02.412 --> 01:08:04.496
You really have to love it.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.375
Do you hear how full it sounds?

01:08:10.837 --> 01:08:14.757
Now, what you want to buy is a
thicker record. They're more stable.

01:08:14.841 --> 01:08:17.301
The grooves in them are
sort of deeper and wider.

01:08:17.385 --> 01:08:18.761
You get more detail.

01:08:18.845 --> 01:08:22.305
I mean, they're harder to carry
around 'cause they're heavier,

01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:24.183
but they're worth it.

01:08:24.893 --> 01:08:26.350
You know,
my parents have this...

01:08:26.895 --> 01:08:31.814
It's an amazing turntable.
It's vintage, cherry wood Victor 45.

01:08:31.899 --> 01:08:35.152
Oh! Perfect tone.
All the original parts.

01:08:37.697 --> 01:08:39.907
I can't wait to hear it again.

01:08:45.078 --> 01:08:48.207
So, what else are you going
to do when you go home?

01:08:51.169 --> 01:08:52.795
I'm going to...

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:56.298
I'm going to listen
to my mum play piano.

01:08:56.381 --> 01:08:59.510
I'm gonna sit
in my dad's garden.

01:08:59.594 --> 01:09:01.886
He grows the most ridiculous sunflowers.
They're like 10 feet tall.

01:09:03.723 --> 01:09:05.890
I'm going to hang out
with my brothers.

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:08.935
I'm gonna play with
my niece and my nephews.

01:09:10.604 --> 01:09:13.564
I'm gonna do all the things
I missed out on for so long.

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:15.234
That sounds great.

01:09:15.318 --> 01:09:16.734
It is.

01:09:18.238 --> 01:09:22.573
I'm not gonna waste my time
on the wrong person.

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:25.202
I'm not gonna
waste my parents' time

01:09:25.286 --> 01:09:28.247
introducing them to
some future stranger.

01:09:29.499 --> 01:09:31.875
And no more days spent picking
out what you're gonna wear

01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:33.794
for nights that
don't mean anything.

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:37.256
No more wondering whether
you're with the right person,

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:40.843
or if this is the guy that
you're meant to have kids with.

01:09:41.426 --> 01:09:43.929
All those ridiculous questions.

01:09:47.267 --> 01:09:49.268
It's liberating.
That's what it is.

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:56.441
Maybe you just haven't
met the right guy.

01:10:06.202 --> 01:10:08.328
You're a really nice person.

01:10:13.126 --> 01:10:15.794
You are an awful
judge of character.

01:10:32.478 --> 01:10:33.604
I'm gonna fix that.

01:10:35.690 --> 01:10:37.149
Okay.

01:10:42.572 --> 01:10:44.990
What do you think
Sorry would like to do?

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:48.785
I don't know.
Lay in the sun somewhere.

01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:50.120
We could look for a Frisbee.

01:10:50.204 --> 01:10:51.997
Or I could set up
a squirrel hunt.

01:10:52.081 --> 01:10:53.248
Do you think he's horny?

01:10:53.333 --> 01:10:56.168
Oh, yes, I think he is
definitely girl-crazy.

01:10:59.505 --> 01:11:03.216
Maybe he wants
to find his owner.

01:11:03.301 --> 01:11:04.760
You know, abandonment issues?

01:11:07.013 --> 01:11:09.264
You know what?
Maybe we're enough for him.

01:11:09.349 --> 01:11:11.850
I don't know,
he seems comfortable.

01:11:19.525 --> 01:11:20.651
What is it?

01:11:21.861 --> 01:11:23.654
It has a return address.

01:11:29.452 --> 01:11:30.911
Is it close?

01:11:32.163 --> 01:11:33.705
Yeah, it's pretty close.

01:11:34.374 --> 01:11:35.874
That's great.

01:11:42.382 --> 01:11:43.632
So...

01:11:43.716 --> 01:11:45.133
We'll go first thing tomorrow.

01:11:45.218 --> 01:11:46.677
Okay.

01:11:48.221 --> 01:11:49.638
Okay.

01:13:35.119 --> 01:13:37.370
Should I...

01:13:37.622 --> 01:13:38.997
Should I disappear?

01:13:39.499 --> 01:13:41.083
No, stay here in the car.

01:14:19.372 --> 01:14:20.872
What happened?

01:14:22.458 --> 01:14:24.042
What's happening?

01:14:27.213 --> 01:14:28.547
Was she home?

01:14:29.882 --> 01:14:31.716
Yeah, I think so.

01:14:32.635 --> 01:14:35.971
Did you knock?
Why are we driving away?

01:14:37.056 --> 01:14:40.392
I wrote her a letter. I put it on her door.
She should get it soon.

01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:44.354
You wrote her a letter?
Well, what did it say?

01:14:45.690 --> 01:14:46.898
It just... It doesn't matter.

01:14:47.817 --> 01:14:50.110
I don't understand. Why don't you
want to see her? What's happened?

01:14:50.194 --> 01:14:51.653
We really can't
talk about this, Penny.

01:14:51.737 --> 01:14:52.696
Why not?

01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:54.239
Because I don't want it
to change anything.

01:14:54.323 --> 01:14:55.490
Change what?

01:14:55.825 --> 01:14:57.159
You have somewhere
you need to be.

01:14:57.243 --> 01:14:59.244
And what about you?
What's changed?

01:15:02.081 --> 01:15:02.898
Dodge!

01:16:16.155 --> 01:16:17.364
You're not taking
this very seriously.

01:16:17.448 --> 01:16:19.449
No, it's very good.

01:16:26.916 --> 01:16:28.583
Wait. Keep practicing.

01:16:29.418 --> 01:16:30.835
Hey!

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:49.497
Where are we?

01:17:50.041 --> 01:17:51.499
Come on.

01:18:11.312 --> 01:18:12.479
Who's there?

01:18:15.858 --> 01:18:17.275
Frank?

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:25.950
Hi, Frank.

01:18:28.788 --> 01:18:30.372
Dodge.

01:18:31.374 --> 01:18:32.957
Is it a bad time?

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:39.130
Why, no. No, of course not.
Come in. Please, come in.

01:18:41.467 --> 01:18:43.134
Thank you.

01:18:46.472 --> 01:18:48.223
Dodger!

01:18:48.307 --> 01:18:50.016
I can't believe it.
You're here,

01:18:50.101 --> 01:18:51.768
you're really here.
Who's your friend?

01:18:53.186 --> 01:18:53.728
This is Penny.

01:18:53.813 --> 01:18:55.146
- Penny, this is Frank.
- Hi.

01:18:55.231 --> 01:18:56.981
Hi. I'm his father.

01:18:57.817 --> 01:19:00.777
Oh! Oh, it's lovely
to meet you.

01:19:00.861 --> 01:19:02.320
You, too!

01:19:03.239 --> 01:19:06.533
Welcome.
Well, you must be hungry or something.

01:19:06.617 --> 01:19:09.077
Actually, I was hoping that
I could talk to you for a minute.

01:19:09.161 --> 01:19:11.621
Sure. Go right
in there. Go ahead.

01:19:11.705 --> 01:19:12.747
Is there a restroom?

01:19:12.832 --> 01:19:15.250
Yeah, right at the top
of the stairs. Here.

01:19:15.334 --> 01:19:16.751
- There you are.
- Thank you.

01:19:16.836 --> 01:19:19.087
Top of the steps on your left.
There you go.

01:19:19.171 --> 01:19:20.755
- What's the dog's name?
- Sorry.

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:22.590
- What?
- Sorry?

01:19:29.682 --> 01:19:31.099
She your girlfriend?

01:19:32.017 --> 01:19:33.017
I don't know.

01:19:33.477 --> 01:19:34.477
She should be.

01:19:41.193 --> 01:19:43.361
Did we get old or what?

01:19:48.784 --> 01:19:50.994
So you're here to tell me
all the things I did wrong?

01:19:51.871 --> 01:19:53.705
No, you know all the
things you did wrong.

01:19:53.789 --> 01:19:55.206
I came here to
ask you something.

01:19:56.667 --> 01:19:58.293
I know I could have
handled things differently.

01:19:58.377 --> 01:20:00.170
I don't want to talk about it.

01:20:01.839 --> 01:20:03.548
You know, your mother
didn't make it any easier...

01:20:03.632 --> 01:20:06.134
Don't. Don't say
another word about her.

01:20:09.138 --> 01:20:11.055
We were so young
when you were born...

01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:13.725
And now you're not,
and neither am I.

01:20:14.518 --> 01:20:16.769
And we had our whole
lives to figure it out.

01:20:17.730 --> 01:20:19.481
I'm just trying
to say I'm sorry.

01:20:19.565 --> 01:20:21.941
Well, just say it, then.

01:20:24.487 --> 01:20:25.904
I'm sorry.

01:20:33.245 --> 01:20:35.079
Now what?

01:20:35.915 --> 01:20:39.209
I don't know.
You were the one with the question.

01:20:42.588 --> 01:20:43.838
I guess I just couldn't believe

01:20:43.923 --> 01:20:45.298
you didn't wanna see
your old man again.

01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:48.343
Your mother wouldn't
take my calls,

01:20:48.427 --> 01:20:51.304
she ripped up all my
cards and letters to you,

01:20:51.388 --> 01:20:52.847
but, you know, I figured
when you got older...

01:20:52.932 --> 01:20:55.308
Not that it was on you, no, no.

01:20:55.392 --> 01:20:56.935
No, I did that.

01:20:58.687 --> 01:21:01.606
I know I lost all my
privileges when I left.

01:21:07.947 --> 01:21:09.656
You know, when you were a baby,

01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:12.325
she used to hold you
so tight sometimes,

01:21:12.409 --> 01:21:14.869
I thought you couldn't breathe.

01:21:17.414 --> 01:21:19.499
Maybe that was just me.

01:21:24.463 --> 01:21:26.297
I really am sorry.

01:21:30.302 --> 01:21:32.136
It doesn't matter anymore.

01:21:34.765 --> 01:21:36.975
We're in the same place now.

01:21:37.977 --> 01:21:40.979
Well, I know I wasn't
there for you back then.

01:21:44.567 --> 01:21:46.234
It's not too late.

01:22:16.682 --> 01:22:17.807
May I propose a toast?

01:22:17.891 --> 01:22:18.975
Please.

01:22:21.687 --> 01:22:25.148
To the beginning of the world.

01:22:29.778 --> 01:22:30.820
It's a good one, that.

01:22:30.904 --> 01:22:32.030
Such a good cheap wine.

01:23:56.782 --> 01:23:59.200
You are the love of my life.

01:26:07.496 --> 01:26:09.080
Elsa, what are you doing here?

01:26:09.706 --> 01:26:11.415
It is Thursday.

01:26:14.086 --> 01:26:17.338
Are you
shitting me, Elsa? Seriously?

01:26:18.173 --> 01:26:23.135
Go home. Just be with your family,
or do anything else.

01:26:23.887 --> 01:26:26.848
I'm serious.
You... Leave. Please.

01:26:33.063 --> 01:26:36.899
It's just that...
You don't... It's not...

01:26:38.068 --> 01:26:41.779
I'm sorry.
I just... I'm not trying...

01:26:44.241 --> 01:26:45.616
Never mind.

01:26:48.203 --> 01:26:50.288
See you next week, Mr. Dodge?

01:26:52.291 --> 01:26:53.332
Okay.

01:26:54.751 --> 01:26:56.961
Bye, Elsa.

01:27:01.967 --> 01:27:03.259
More Windose!

01:27:05.053 --> 01:27:06.470
More Windose.

01:27:11.268 --> 01:27:14.729
Matilda will be arriving
one week ahead of schedule.

01:27:14.813 --> 01:27:18.232
The point of contact
is 16 hours, 26 minutes away,

01:27:18.317 --> 01:27:19.901
so be sure to
mark your calendars.

01:27:20.402 --> 01:27:21.569
Also, a friendly reminder

01:27:21.653 --> 01:27:24.572
to set your clocks ahead
for daylight savings time.

01:27:24.656 --> 01:27:26.908
Spring forward.
That's one hour ahead.

01:27:28.327 --> 01:27:31.495
On a personal note,
this is my final broadcast.

01:27:31.955 --> 01:27:33.664
Our final broadcast.

01:27:34.333 --> 01:27:37.168
On behalf of myself,
producer Bruce Hammond,

01:27:37.252 --> 01:27:38.920
and everyone here
at the network,

01:27:39.004 --> 01:27:40.922
we bid you all a fond farewell.

01:27:41.632 --> 01:27:45.134
It has been my pleasure to bring
you the news for the past 27 years.

01:27:46.136 --> 01:27:49.597
Tonight, I'll be sitting across the
dinner table from my wife, Helen,

01:27:49.681 --> 01:27:53.017
and we'll be talking about
our sons, Henry and Paul.

01:27:53.977 --> 01:27:57.146
And we'll be saying our prayers
for each and every one of you.

01:27:58.148 --> 01:28:02.443
Good night, good luck,
and God bless.

01:30:59.162 --> 01:31:00.955
Hey, what is it?

01:31:05.168 --> 01:31:06.919
How could you let me go?

01:31:09.005 --> 01:31:11.966
I don't know. It was so stupid.

01:31:16.179 --> 01:31:17.805
I woke up.

01:31:19.057 --> 01:31:21.058
I made him turn around.

01:31:26.898 --> 01:31:29.525
I don't want to
fall asleep, okay?

01:31:31.319 --> 01:31:32.653
Don't let me fall asleep.
Promise.

01:31:32.737 --> 01:31:33.988
I promise.

01:31:36.741 --> 01:31:38.242
What about your parents?

01:31:39.161 --> 01:31:41.745
They're romantics,
they understand.

01:31:42.539 --> 01:31:44.582
Besides,
they've got each other.

01:31:46.001 --> 01:31:48.210
I just want to be with you.

01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:50.963
And I want to be with you.

01:31:53.091 --> 01:31:56.594
I couldn't live without you.
No matter how long.

01:32:02.058 --> 01:32:03.767
What do we do now?

01:32:05.604 --> 01:32:09.315
I just want to lay here with you.
Just want to talk to you.

01:32:13.904 --> 01:32:15.272
What are we gonna talk about?

01:32:17.616 --> 01:32:19.450
Where'd you grow up?

01:32:20.368 --> 01:32:22.995
Well, I was born in Surrey.

01:32:23.079 --> 01:32:24.163
I know.

01:32:24.247 --> 01:32:25.706
My whole family are from there.

01:32:27.792 --> 01:32:30.211
My mum was a journalist
before she married my dad.

01:32:30.295 --> 01:32:33.797
They never fought.
Or at least we never heard them fight.

01:32:34.966 --> 01:32:38.010
Charlie's the oldest,
then Benny, then me.

01:32:39.221 --> 01:32:41.472
We had a sister, but she
died when she was born.

01:32:41.973 --> 01:32:43.515
I still think about her.

01:32:45.343 --> 01:32:46.143
Oh, God!

01:32:46.394 --> 01:32:49.521
What was her name?
What was your sister's name?

01:32:50.190 --> 01:32:52.024
Patricia.

01:32:52.234 --> 01:32:54.068
Patricia Hope Lockhart.

01:32:54.152 --> 01:32:56.487
That's beautiful.
That's a beautiful name.

01:32:56.571 --> 01:32:59.156
I wish I'd met you
a long time ago.

01:33:00.242 --> 01:33:01.700
When we were kids.

01:33:01.785 --> 01:33:05.246
It couldn't have happened any other way.
It had to happen now.

01:33:06.748 --> 01:33:08.666
But it isn't enough time.

01:33:10.085 --> 01:33:11.835
It never would have been.

01:33:14.839 --> 01:33:16.423
- I'm scared.
- I...

01:33:16.967 --> 01:33:19.677
Am madly in love
with you, Penny.

01:33:20.345 --> 01:33:22.972
You're my favorite,
favorite thing.

01:33:24.849 --> 01:33:27.851
I thought that somehow
we'd save each other.

01:33:29.479 --> 01:33:30.938
We did.

01:33:33.608 --> 01:33:35.025
Penny...

01:33:37.028 --> 01:33:39.446
I'm really glad
I got to know you.
