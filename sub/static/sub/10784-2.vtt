00:01.417 --> 00:02.875
Announcer: PREVIOUSLY ON
DAWSON'S CREEK...

00:02.875 --> 00:03.834
I'M JEN.

00:03.834 --> 00:05.041
SO YOU'LL BE GOING
TO SCHOOL HERE THEN?

00:05.041 --> 00:07.000
YEAH. UH, 10th GRADE.

00:07.000 --> 00:07.500
GOD, LOOK AT HER.

00:07.500 --> 00:09.458
OH, YEAH.

00:09.458 --> 00:10.917
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

00:10.917 --> 00:12.458
WHY DON'T YOU
CALL ME MISS JACOBS
DURING SCHOOL HOURS?

00:12.458 --> 00:15.875
I'M MAKING A MOVIE.
KIND OF YOUNG
TO BE SO AMBITIOUS.

00:15.875 --> 00:17.875
I WAS DENIED ADMITTANCE
TO YOUR FILM CLASS.

00:17.875 --> 00:19.875
SORRY, BUT NO IS MY
DEFINITIVE ANSWER.

00:19.875 --> 00:22.000
AND WE CAN'T
TALK TO EACH OTHER
THE WAY WE USED TO.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.417
I DON'T WANT
TO LOSE YOU, JOEY.

00:23.417 --> 00:24.333
WHAT?!
OHH!

00:24.333 --> 00:26.792
I'M THE BEST SEX
YOU'LL NEVER HAVE.

00:29.500 --> 00:31.000
I KNOW WHAT I SAW.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
IT WAS BIG, IT WAS UGLY,
AND IT ATTACKED ME,

00:33.000 --> 00:34.417
AND IT'S STILL OUT THERE,
JUST WAITING.

00:34.417 --> 00:35.875
I MAY NOT BELIEVE YOU,
STEPHANIE,

00:35.875 --> 00:38.750
BUT I BELIEVE IN YOU.

00:41.667 --> 00:42.708
OHH! UHH!

00:42.708 --> 00:44.375
WHAT? WHAT? COME ON!

00:44.375 --> 00:45.375
I'M SORRY.

00:45.375 --> 00:46.417
[COUGHING]

00:46.417 --> 00:48.458
I'M SORRY, DAWSON.
HE IS JUST TOO REPELLING.

00:48.458 --> 00:51.208
JOEY, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO KISS HIM.

00:51.208 --> 00:53.333
I CANNOT AND WILL NOT
KISS THAT CRETIN.

00:53.333 --> 00:55.375
IT'S A MOVIE.
YOU'RE PLAYING
A CHARACTER.

00:55.375 --> 00:57.041
IT'S NOT PACEY
YOU'RE KISSING.

00:57.041 --> 00:58.917
SO HE'S A SEA SERPENT
FROM THE DEEP.
CITE THE DIFFERENCE.

00:58.917 --> 01:02.000
BUT YOU'RE NOT AWARE
OF HIS EVIL ALTER EGO.
YOU'RE IN LOVE.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.792
FORGET IT.

01:03.792 --> 01:05.583
THE MOVIE DOESN'T WORK
WITHOUT THE KISS, JOEY.
IT'S A LOVE STORY.

01:05.583 --> 01:07.125
IT'S
A HORROR MOVIE.

01:07.125 --> 01:10.041
IT'S AN HOMAGE,
WITH A HEAVY
ALLEGORICAL SLANT.

01:11.959 --> 01:14.041
BUT HE'S SO...

01:14.041 --> 01:16.583
UNKISS-WORTHY.

01:16.583 --> 01:18.166
DO IT FOR ME?

01:18.166 --> 01:21.000
I DON'T WANT TO
REGURGITATE ON CAMERA.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.375
WHY DON'T YOU KISS HIM?

01:22.375 --> 01:25.417
BECAUSE MY LIPS
ARE RESERVED FOR
SOMEONE ELSE.

01:25.417 --> 01:29.250
HAVE YOU KISSED LITTLE
"MISS-SOMEONE-ELSE" YET?

01:29.250 --> 01:31.208
THERE'S NO NEED
TO RUSH FATE.

01:31.208 --> 01:33.333
WELL, DON'T WAIT
AN ETERNITY, DAWSON.

01:33.333 --> 01:36.333
I MEAN, SHE'S FROM
NEW YORK, WHERE THINGS
TEND TO MOVE FASTER.

01:36.333 --> 01:38.834
WELL, THEN SO HOW
ENCHANTING TO MEET A
STRAPPING YOUNG MAN

01:38.834 --> 01:39.917
WHO DOESN'T HAVE
SEX ON THE BRAIN.

01:39.917 --> 01:43.291
HELPS YOU
SLEEP AT NIGHT.

01:43.291 --> 01:45.125
JOEY, YOU HEARD
HER FOR HERSELF,

01:45.125 --> 01:46.875
THROUGH HER
OWN ADMITTANCE, SHE'S
A SELF-PROCLAIMED VIRGIN.

01:46.875 --> 01:49.291
FOR ANOTHER SECOND.

01:49.291 --> 01:51.959
JEN HAPPENS TO BE
A BRIGHT, INTELLIGENT
YOUNG WOMAN

01:51.959 --> 01:54.083
WHO IS CLEARLY IN CHARGE
OF HER OWN BODY.

01:54.083 --> 01:55.708
I'M NOT SUGGESTING
LEATHER STRAPS
AND CRISCO,

01:55.708 --> 01:58.041
JUST A KISS.

01:58.041 --> 02:01.417
JEN AND I WILL DEFINITELY
KISS, DON'T YOU WORRY.

02:01.417 --> 02:03.083
THE QUESTION IS,
WILL YOUR LIPS
EVER FIND PACEY'S?

02:03.083 --> 02:04.792
I VOTE FOR
AN EXTENSIVE REWRITE.

02:04.792 --> 02:07.959
WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD,

02:07.959 --> 02:11.041
BECAUSE YOU DEFINITELY
HAVE KISSING LIPS.

02:11.041 --> 02:12.708
WHAT?

02:12.708 --> 02:14.250
CHECK THAT OUT.

02:15.750 --> 02:17.708
YOU GIVE GOOD LIP.

02:18.250 --> 02:20.458
YOU KNOW, JOEY,

02:20.458 --> 02:23.166
YOU COULD ALWAYS JUST
CLOSE YOUR EYES AND
THINK OF SOMEONE ELSE.

02:23.166 --> 02:24.417
[SIGHS]

02:27.083 --> 02:29.208
EXPLAIN TO ME
THE CRISCO.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.083
AHEM.

03:26.083 --> 03:29.750
DON'T FORGET ABOUT
THE BIG DANCE ON SATURDAY

03:29.750 --> 03:32.708
TO CELEBRATE OUR VICTORY
AT THE BIG GAME ON FRIDAY,

03:32.708 --> 03:35.000
EVEN IF WE DON'T KNOW YET
IF WE'LL EVEN WIN
THE BIG GAME,

03:35.000 --> 03:38.041
BUT THE PLANNING COMMITTEE
IS REALLY OPTIMISTIC,

03:38.041 --> 03:40.125
SO GET YOUR TICKETS NOW!

03:40.125 --> 03:41.208
MR. GOLD,

03:41.208 --> 03:42.834
YOU GOT A SEC?

03:42.834 --> 03:44.250
WHAT IS IT, DAWSON?

03:45.667 --> 03:48.542
UM, WELL, I'VE
BEEN THINKING ABOUT
WHAT YOU SAID,

03:48.542 --> 03:51.500
AND YOU WERE RIGHT
NOT TO LET ME
INTO YOUR CLASS.

03:53.375 --> 03:57.000
I'M GLAD YOU GAVE IT
SOME THOUGHT.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.667
I AM, HOWEVER,
IN A BIT OF A JAM.

03:59.667 --> 04:01.708
SEE, I HAVE
STUDY HALL FIFTH PERIOD
IN THE LIBRARY,

04:01.708 --> 04:03.708
AND IT'S--IT'S REALLY
CROWDED IN THERE.

04:03.708 --> 04:06.125
IT'S A MAJOR OVERLOAD.
IT'S REALLY UNPLEASANT,

04:06.125 --> 04:07.458
YOU KNOW.

04:07.458 --> 04:09.125
AND I TALKED TO
MR. GIBBONS ABOUT
SWITCHING STUDY HALL,

04:09.125 --> 04:10.708
AND HE
SEEMED TO THINK THAT,
WITH YOUR PERMISSION,

04:10.708 --> 04:13.041
I COULD JUST SPEND
STUDY HALL WITH YOU.

04:13.041 --> 04:15.792
HMM. FIFTH PERIOD.

04:15.792 --> 04:19.250
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHEN FILM CLASS IS.

04:19.250 --> 04:21.916
NOW, THAT'S AN UNCANNY
COINCIDENCE.

04:22.792 --> 04:24.750
YOU WILL NOT BE
PART OF THE CLASS,

04:24.750 --> 04:26.250
YOU WILL SIT IN
THE BACK AND BE QUIET,

04:26.250 --> 04:28.291
YOU WILL NOT PARTICIPATE OR
INVOLVE YOURSELF IN ANY WAY.

04:28.291 --> 04:29.917
GREAT. GREAT.
THANK YOU, MR. GOLD.
THANK YOU.

04:29.917 --> 04:32.708
I...I REALLY--
THIS IS--THIS IS
A BIG DEAL.

04:48.792 --> 04:50.208
GOOD MORNING,
MISS JACOBS.

04:50.208 --> 04:51.834
GOOD MORNING, PACEY.

04:53.291 --> 04:54.792
CAN WE TALK?

04:54.792 --> 04:56.792
UH, YOU KNOW,
THIS ISN'T YOUR CLASS.

04:56.792 --> 04:58.250
SO, UM,
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

04:58.250 --> 05:02.583
NO. WE REALLY
NEED TO TALK.

05:02.583 --> 05:04.417
WELL, WE HAVE
NOTHING TO DISCUSS,

05:04.417 --> 05:07.208
EXCEPT HOMEWORK, OF
WHICH THERE IS NONE.

05:07.208 --> 05:10.208
SO...YOU
CAN RUN ALONG.

05:10.208 --> 05:12.917
THERE'S
A LOT TO DISCUSS.

05:12.917 --> 05:16.792
WE COULD START WITH
THE OPEN-MOUTH KISS,
IF YOU LIKE.

05:16.792 --> 05:18.792
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT,

05:18.792 --> 05:19.834
AND I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO INSIST

05:19.834 --> 05:21.708
THAT YOU LEAVE THIS
CLASSROOM IMMEDIATELY.

05:21.708 --> 05:24.458
LISTEN, I'M JUST
AS CONFUSED ABOUT
THIS AS YOU ARE.

05:24.458 --> 05:26.417
PACEY, PLEASE.

05:26.417 --> 05:28.417
NOTHING HAPPENED.

05:28.417 --> 05:30.083
THERE WAS NO KISS.

05:30.083 --> 05:32.667
PLEASE, DON'T.

05:35.208 --> 05:38.375
YOUR TONGUE
WAS IN MY MOUTH.

05:40.291 --> 05:43.333
YOU'RE NOT
BEING FAIR.

05:50.875 --> 05:52.667
GOOD MORNING,
EVERYONE.

05:52.667 --> 05:54.542
OK, I'M NOT GONNA
BE ABLE TO COUNT ON
THE FILM CLASS FOR SUPPORT

05:54.542 --> 05:55.959
LIKE I WAS HOPING.

05:55.959 --> 05:56.959
WHICH MEANS WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO WORK OVERTIME

05:56.959 --> 05:59.333
IF WE WANT TO MEET
THE FESTIVAL DEADLINE.

05:59.333 --> 06:00.667
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO SHOOT ALL WEEKEND.

06:00.667 --> 06:03.208
JOEY, THIS MEANS
NO LIP ABOUT GIVING
PACEY LIP.

06:03.208 --> 06:04.667
I'M REACHING
A BREAKING POINT WITH
THIS WHOLE KISS THING.

06:04.667 --> 06:07.583
LISTEN, I'M NOT
ENGORGED WITH THIS
EITHER, OK?

06:07.583 --> 06:09.000
IT GOES BOTH WAYS.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.041
JOEY...

06:10.041 --> 06:11.333
MAJOR REVELATION.

06:11.333 --> 06:13.792
ALL RIGHT,
I THINK I KNOW A WAY

06:13.792 --> 06:15.500
TO MAKE YOU THE HAPPIEST
ACTRESS IN THE WORLD.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.834
YOU KNOW HOW YOU DIE
AT THE END OF THE MOVIE?

06:17.834 --> 06:20.041
HOW WOULD YOU
LIKE TO DIE SOONER,
LIKE TOMORROW?

06:20.041 --> 06:22.458
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

06:22.458 --> 06:23.875
OK, YOUR CHARACTER,
IN A SURPRISE ATTACK,
IS KILLED VIOLENTLY,

06:23.875 --> 06:27.708
BUT YOUR BEAUTIFUL,
BUT BRIGHT COUSIN
FROM NEW YORK

06:27.708 --> 06:30.708
ARRIVES JUST IN TIME TO
FIND YOUR MUTILATED BODY.

06:30.708 --> 06:33.125
YOU KNOW, DUDE,
I THINK YOU'RE ONTO
SOMETHING HERE.

06:33.125 --> 06:34.708
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT A MINUTE.
IF IT MEANS I'M GONNA
BE PLAYING--

06:34.708 --> 06:35.834
NO, NO, IT'S PERFECT.

06:35.834 --> 06:37.208
SEE, THIS NULLIFIES
THE KISS ISSUE

06:37.208 --> 06:38.917
AND PUTS YOU
BACK BEHIND THE CAMERA
WITH ME WHERE YOU BELONG.

06:38.917 --> 06:42.083
WELL, BUT, I MEAN,
HAVEN'T YOU ALREADY
SHOT A LOT OF STUFF

06:42.083 --> 06:44.125
WITH JOEY'S CHARACTER?

06:44.125 --> 06:46.000
IT'S AN EASY COVER.
IT'S BETTER THIS WAY.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.708
IT'S SO UNPREDICTABLE.
THE AUDIENCE IS NEVER
GOING TO SEE IT COMING.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.542
IT'S LIKE JANET LEE
IN PSYCHO.

06:49.542 --> 06:51.750
DREW BARRYMORE
IN SCREAM.

06:51.750 --> 06:53.333
OH, A RIP-OFF
OF A RIP-OFF.

06:53.333 --> 06:54.708
YEAH, I REALLY THINK
IT FITS RIGHT IN LINE

06:54.708 --> 06:55.375
WITH THE WHOLE
TONE OF THE PIECE,
DON'T YOU THINK?

06:55.375 --> 06:57.875
YOU'RE RIGHT,
DAWSON.

06:57.875 --> 06:59.458
IT'S PERFECT.

06:59.458 --> 07:03.375
OK, SOMEONE EXPLAIN
TO ME THE STATE
OF CATHERINE'S MIND

07:03.375 --> 07:05.458
AS SHE DROVE
HEATHCLIFF AWAY.

07:05.458 --> 07:08.917
OH! IT WAS HER TRAGIC
AND DYSFUNCTIONAL WAY

07:08.917 --> 07:10.166
OF LETTING HIM
KNOW SHE LOVED HIM.

07:10.166 --> 07:14.834
YES, THAT'S
THE OBVIOUS INTERPRETATION
OF THE MOMENT.

07:14.834 --> 07:17.625
HOWEVER, I THINK
IT GOES DEEPER THAN THAT.

07:17.625 --> 07:21.750
FOR SOME REASON,
THIS STORY IS REGARDED
AS SOME GREAT LOVE STORY.

07:21.750 --> 07:23.083
BUT THE REALITY IS,

07:23.083 --> 07:25.625
THAT HEATHCLIFF
AND CATHERINE NEVER
BELONGED TOGETHER.

07:25.625 --> 07:28.417
THEY NEVER SHOULD
HAVE BEEN TOGETHER.

07:28.417 --> 07:30.583
CATHERINE WAS
ESSENTIALLY A MESS,

07:30.583 --> 07:32.625
HEATHCLIFF WAS
BASICALLY A DECENT GUY

07:32.625 --> 07:35.125
WHO HAD A LOT
TO LEARN ABOUT LIFE,

07:35.125 --> 07:38.250
AND HE WAS INHERENTLY
BETTER OFF WITHOUT
SOME WHIMPERING,

07:38.250 --> 07:40.625
MENTALLY UNSTABLE WET RAG
FOLLOWING HIM AROUND.

07:40.625 --> 07:42.458
THE WHOLE THING
WAS WRONG.

07:42.458 --> 07:44.375
NEVER SHOULD
HAVE HAPPENED.

07:44.375 --> 07:46.625
BRONTE SHOULD HAVE
SAVED HER INK.

07:50.125 --> 07:54.250
SO, WE'LL HAVE TO
MOVE FAST IF WE WANT TO
ENTER THE FILM FESTIVAL.

07:54.250 --> 07:55.750
Student:
WE CAN MAKE IT.
THE SCRIPT IS DONE,

07:55.750 --> 07:57.125
THE MOVIE'S BOARDED,

07:57.125 --> 07:58.750
AND WE DID A LOT
OF THE WORK OVER
THE SUMMER.

07:58.750 --> 08:00.291
THEN LET'S
MOVE ON TO STORY.

08:00.291 --> 08:01.750
HAVE YOU SOLVED
YOUR THIRD ACT PROBLEM?

08:01.750 --> 08:03.500
MR. GOLD?
YES, DAWSON?

08:03.500 --> 08:04.959
WOULD THAT
BE THE BOSTON
FILM FESTIVAL?

08:04.959 --> 08:08.542
YES, THAT WOULD BE.
THEY HAVE A JUNIOR VIDEO
LEVEL COMPETITION.

08:08.542 --> 08:11.208
OK, THE THIRD ACT.

08:11.208 --> 08:12.333
I'VE JUST BEEN INJURED
IN THE BIG GAME
WITH TYLER,

08:12.333 --> 08:14.291
MY THROWING ARM
CRUSHED,

08:14.291 --> 08:16.291
THE BONE BROKEN
IN 3 PLACES.

08:16.291 --> 08:18.208
BUT I REFUSE
TO TELL THE COACH

08:18.208 --> 08:20.375
BECAUSE HE WON'T LET ME
PLAY AT HOMECOMING
IF I DO.

08:20.375 --> 08:22.667
NOW, REMEMBER, WE WANT
THE AUDIENCE ASKING,

08:22.667 --> 08:24.166
"CAN HE DO IT?

08:24.166 --> 08:26.834
WILL THE TEAM
WIN THE BIG GAME?"

08:26.834 --> 08:28.375
REMEMBER, THIS
IS AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL,

08:28.375 --> 08:30.750
SO IF ANYBODY
HAS ANY QUESTIONS,
I WAS THERE, I LIVED IT.

08:30.750 --> 08:33.207
COME TALK TO ME,
ALL RIGHT?

08:34.291 --> 08:35.958
HELMETS OF GLORY.

08:35.958 --> 08:38.291
CHRONICLES LAST YEAR'S
FOOTBALL SEASON.

08:38.291 --> 08:40.667
AND GET THIS. MR. CLIFF
QUARTERBACK HIMSELF

08:40.667 --> 08:43.166
IS WRITING, DIRECTING,
AND STARRING IN THIS.

08:43.166 --> 08:44.792
OH, A STREISAND.

08:44.792 --> 08:46.500
THIS IS SERIOUS, JOE.

08:46.500 --> 08:48.375
THEY'RE ENTERING IT
IN THE FILM FESTIVAL.

08:48.375 --> 08:49.708
MY FILM FESTIVAL.

08:49.708 --> 08:51.333
THIS IS MY IMMEDIATE
COMPETITION.

08:51.333 --> 08:52.708
AND IT'S A SPORTS FILM?

08:52.708 --> 08:53.917
A THIN AND PEDESTRIAN
SPORTS FILM.

08:53.917 --> 08:57.291
OH, THE EPITOME
OF EVERYTHING
YOU'RE AGAINST.

08:57.291 --> 09:00.834
COULD LIFE
BE MORE CRUEL?

09:00.834 --> 09:02.708
HI, I'M CLIFF.

09:02.708 --> 09:03.417
HI, I'M JEN.

09:03.417 --> 09:07.583
THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.

09:07.583 --> 09:09.667
I KNOW THAT BEING
THE NEW KID CAN BE
KIND OF TRAUMATIC.

09:09.667 --> 09:11.125
SO IF THERE'S
ANYTHING I CAN DO,
YOU KNOW,

09:11.125 --> 09:12.375
TO TAKE
THE EDGE OFF,

09:12.375 --> 09:14.125
UH, INTRODUCE
YOU AROUND,

09:14.125 --> 09:15.583
TAKE YOU OUT...

09:15.583 --> 09:17.750
THAT'S--THAT'S
REALLY SWEET OF YOU.

09:17.750 --> 09:20.708
UM, CAN I LET YOU KNOW?
I MEAN, I'M STILL GETTING
SETTLED AND STUFF.

09:20.708 --> 09:22.667
SURE.
SURE, ABSOLUTELY.

09:22.667 --> 09:24.750
AND IT WAS NICE
TO MEET YOU, JEN,

09:24.750 --> 09:26.291
SHORT FOR JENNIFER.

09:26.291 --> 09:29.000
YOU, TOO, CLIFF.
SHORT FOR CLIFFORD.

09:35.875 --> 09:39.834
I TOLD YOU, DAWSON.
THEY MOVE FAST
IN NEW YORK.

09:46.125 --> 09:46.583
Dawson: DAD.

09:46.583 --> 09:48.542
HEY, DAD,

09:48.542 --> 09:50.750
HAVE YOU SEEN
MY CAMCORDER?

09:50.750 --> 09:51.917
FILMING TODAY?

09:51.917 --> 09:54.083
YEAH. JOEY
GETS DECAPITATED.

09:54.083 --> 09:56.917
IT'S, UH, IN MY BEDROOM
ON THE NIGHT TABLE,
YOUR MOTHER'S SIDE.

09:56.917 --> 10:00.166
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO TAKE THE TAPE OUT.

10:00.166 --> 10:03.000
YOU CAN GET ARRESTED
FOR THAT IN SOME STATES.

10:05.750 --> 10:08.417
UM, I HAVE A QUESTION.

10:10.041 --> 10:13.500
IT'S KIND OF
A GIRL/RELATIONSHIP
QUESTION,

10:13.500 --> 10:15.041
AND I DON'T WANT
IT TO GO TO YOUR HEAD

10:15.041 --> 10:17.583
THAT I'M SOLICITING
FATHERLY ADVICE
OR ANYTHING.

10:17.583 --> 10:21.417
BUT--'CAUSE I CLEARLY
DON'T CONDONE YOURS AND
MOM'S PERVERSE SEX LIFE.

10:21.417 --> 10:23.875
BUT I'M NOT TOO
PROUD TO ADMIT THAT
MY OWN INEXPERIENCE

10:23.875 --> 10:26.667
IS HINDERING MY CURRENT
FEMALE RELATIONS.

10:26.667 --> 10:29.125
WELL,
WHAT'S THE QUESTION?

10:29.125 --> 10:30.834
MECHANICS OF KISSING.

10:30.834 --> 10:32.834
HOW CAN I HELP?

10:34.333 --> 10:34.875
WELL...

10:37.500 --> 10:38.792
I'M INTERESTED
IN TECHNIQUE.

10:38.792 --> 10:40.792
WELL, THERE IS
NO TECHNIQUE, DAWSON.

10:40.792 --> 10:44.417
YOU JUST PUT YOUR LIPS
TOGETHER AND GO.

10:44.417 --> 10:45.792
YEAH, BUT WHAT
MAKES A GOOD KISS?

10:45.792 --> 10:49.291
THE FIRST TIME
I KISSED YOUR MOTHER--

10:49.291 --> 10:51.041
AND DON'T
GET TOO DETAILED.

11:01.291 --> 11:02.792
AND WE WERE
OUT ON A BOAT,

11:02.792 --> 11:04.792
AND YOUR MOTHER'S LIPS
WERE CHAPPED FROM THE SUN,

11:04.792 --> 11:06.667
AND SHE ASKED ME IF SHE
COULD BORROW MY CHAPSTICK.

11:06.667 --> 11:09.291
SO I TOOK IT OUT,

11:09.291 --> 11:12.250
AND I PUT SOME
ON MY LIPS.

11:12.250 --> 11:15.333
AND THEN I LEANED OVER
AND KISSED HER.

11:16.583 --> 11:19.291
THE CHAPSTICK
WAS REALLY SMOOTH

11:19.291 --> 11:21.667
AND JUST SLID
ONTO HER LIPS.

11:21.667 --> 11:24.250
THE SENSATION
WAS AMAZING.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.458
I MEAN, THE CHEMISTRY
WAS ALREADY THERE,
YOU KNOW,

11:28.458 --> 11:34.000
BUT THIS WAS JUST
ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT
CEMENTED IT, YOU KNOW.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.166
IT WAS UNFORGETTABLE.

11:36.166 --> 11:39.875
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,
ROMANTIC.

11:41.291 --> 11:43.708
SEE, AND HERE I THOUGHT
YOU WERE ALL ABOUT SEX.

11:43.708 --> 11:46.417
WELL, WE STILL
JUMPED EACH OTHER.

11:46.417 --> 11:48.458
HA HA. BUT YOU
GOTTA HAVE ROMANCE.

11:48.458 --> 11:52.000
IT'S ALL ABOUT ROMANCE...

11:52.000 --> 11:54.333
AND CHAPSTICK.

11:55.750 --> 11:57.542
OK.

11:57.542 --> 12:00.166
BUT THE KISS ITSELF?

12:00.166 --> 12:01.041
WHAT DID YOU DO?

12:03.708 --> 12:05.708
WELL, HERE...

12:05.708 --> 12:07.708
GIVE IT A TRY.

12:07.708 --> 12:09.667
NO.

12:09.667 --> 12:13.542
WELL, COME ON.
THIS IS A BIG FATHER/SON
MOMENT HERE.

12:13.542 --> 12:15.166
YOU ASKED FOR IT.

12:19.250 --> 12:20.542
ALL RIGHT.

12:20.542 --> 12:22.083
ALL RIGHT.

12:22.083 --> 12:24.792
NOW, MOISTEN
YOUR LIPS...

12:24.792 --> 12:26.417
AND GO FOR IT.

12:26.417 --> 12:28.625
HA HA. I DON'T--

12:28.625 --> 12:30.041
WAIT, THE TRICK IS,

12:30.041 --> 12:32.333
IT'S YOUR BOTTOM LIP.
YOU GOT TO KEEP IT RELAXED,
ALL RIGHT?

12:32.333 --> 12:35.500
YOU--YOU WANT
TO LET IT HAVE
A MIND OF ITS OWN.

12:35.500 --> 12:38.875
YOU WANT IT TO DANCE

12:38.875 --> 12:40.250
WITH HERS.

12:40.250 --> 12:42.834
GO ON.

12:51.208 --> 12:52.834
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

13:06.625 --> 13:08.208
THAT WAS GOOD.

13:08.208 --> 13:09.041
YEAH?
YEAH.

13:12.667 --> 13:13.917
COOL.

13:20.250 --> 13:23.625
UM...FORGET THIS
EVER HAPPENED?

13:25.125 --> 13:26.542
ALL RIGHT.

13:26.542 --> 13:28.667
THANKS.

13:34.208 --> 13:36.750
Woman: YES,
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.

13:36.750 --> 13:39.917
NO, NO, NO, NO,
I CAN'T. HE'S DOWNSTAIRS.

13:43.458 --> 13:45.500
OK, BUT THEN
I'M HANGING UP.

[KISSING SOUNDS]

13:47.667 --> 13:49.250
HA HA HA HA HA.

13:49.250 --> 13:51.667
OK, I PROMISE.
I PROMISE.

13:51.667 --> 13:54.291

13:58.625 --> 14:01.708
JOEY, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

14:01.708 --> 14:03.500
UH, I WAS JUST
LOOKING FOR DAWSON.

14:03.500 --> 14:05.166
WE'RE FILMING TODAY.

14:05.166 --> 14:07.583
OH, THAT'S NICE.

14:07.583 --> 14:08.792

WEAR SUNBLOCK.

14:22.250 --> 14:24.333
WELL, SEE YOU LATER,
MRS. LEERY.

14:24.333 --> 14:25.000
YOU, TOO, JOEY.

14:27.333 --> 14:30.083
MRS. LEERY?

14:30.083 --> 14:31.583
HMM?

14:32.583 --> 14:35.208
I KNOW.

14:45.959 --> 14:47.208
STEVEN?

14:50.667 --> 14:52.458
STEVEN?

14:59.708 --> 15:01.166
AAH!

15:13.667 --> 15:14.959
AND, CUT!

15:14.959 --> 15:16.041
BEAUTIFUL.

15:16.041 --> 15:17.875
Jen: GUYS, THAT
LOOKED REALLY GOOD.

15:19.417 --> 15:21.542
PERFECT. THAT COULD
NOT HAVE GONE ANY BETTER.

15:21.542 --> 15:23.083
OHH! JOEY,
YOU DIE SO WELL.

15:23.083 --> 15:25.542
DAWSON, COULD WE
GET ANOTHER ONE
OF THOSE,

15:25.542 --> 15:27.458
'CAUSE I SO LOVE
THAT IMAGE.

15:27.458 --> 15:29.125
NO, WE'RE
BEHIND SCHEDULE.
MOVING ON.

15:48.375 --> 15:49.875
HEY, JOEY, LET ME HELP
YOU GET THAT BLOOD OFF.

15:49.875 --> 15:51.834
OH, IT'S OK.
I THINK I CAN--

15:51.834 --> 15:54.291
NO, COME ON.
I DON'T MIND AT ALL.

15:56.375 --> 16:00.166
OOH, LOOKS LIKE IT'S
REALLY STUCK ON THERE,
DOESN'T IT?

16:00.166 --> 16:02.208
I--I CAN GET IT.

16:02.208 --> 16:03.250
OK.

16:04.834 --> 16:08.625
HERE, LET'S
COVER YOU UP.

16:08.625 --> 16:10.458
HERE, GO AHEAD.

16:13.250 --> 16:15.458
YOU HAVE NICE BREASTS.

16:15.458 --> 16:18.583
I MEAN, DON'T
GET THE WRONG IDEA.
I'M COMPLETELY HETERO.

16:18.583 --> 16:19.917
I'M JUST COMMENTING
GIRL TO GIRL.

16:19.917 --> 16:22.750
YOU HAVE A REALLY
NICE BODY.

16:25.291 --> 16:26.792
I'M TOO TALL.

16:26.792 --> 16:28.458
NO, YOU'RE NOT AT ALL.
YOU'RE COMMANDING.

16:28.458 --> 16:31.583
I MEAN, COME ON,
I WISH I HAD YOUR STATURE
AND YOUR LONG LEGS.

16:31.583 --> 16:34.083
MY BODY'S A MESS.

16:34.083 --> 16:37.500
I MEAN, I'M TOO SHORT,
MY HIPS DO THIS WEIRD THING,

16:37.500 --> 16:38.792
AND MY FACE IS
SHAPED LIKE A DUCK.

16:38.792 --> 16:41.583
OH, AND I
HATE MY BREASTS.

16:41.583 --> 16:43.333
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

16:43.333 --> 16:46.834
YEAH, I MEAN,
IT'S COMPLETELY NORMAL
TO HATE THE WAY YOU LOOK.

16:52.792 --> 16:54.917
YOU DON'T LOOK
LIKE A DUCK.

16:54.917 --> 16:59.291
YOU KNOW, THAT'S
THE NICEST THING YOU'VE
SAID TO ME SINCE WE MET.

17:02.625 --> 17:03.500
[SIGHS]

17:03.500 --> 17:06.458
I'LL TAKE THESE
WET THINGS INSIDE.

17:06.458 --> 17:10.458
JOEY, I PLAN TO MAKE
IT REALLY HARD FOR YOU
NOT TO LIKE ME.

17:16.666 --> 17:19.875
Pacey: DON'T WORRY.
I HOPE YOU FIND
YOUR COUSIN.

17:19.875 --> 17:23.458
THAT'S SO SWEET OF YOU.
I CAN NEVER THANK YOU
ENOUGH.

17:26.583 --> 17:27.791
MMM...

17:27.791 --> 17:28.625
WHOA. WHOA. CUT!

17:28.625 --> 17:31.834
WHOA, CUT! CUT!

17:31.834 --> 17:34.125
CUT! PACEY, WHAT
THE HELL ARE YOU
DOING?

17:34.125 --> 17:35.417
I'M KISSING, MAN.
WHAT DOES IT LOOK
LIKE I'M DOING?

17:35.417 --> 17:36.875
SNORKELING.
THAT'S NOT THE WAY
IT'S SCRIPTED.

17:36.875 --> 17:39.625
ARE YOU OK?
DID HE HURT YOU?

17:39.625 --> 17:40.417
NO, NO, NO,
I'M FINE.

17:40.417 --> 17:43.083
IT WAS JUST
A KISS, DAWSON.

17:43.083 --> 17:44.583
YEAH, AND
YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:44.583 --> 17:46.250
HONESTLY, I THINK
WE SHOULD HAVE
ANOTHER, YEAH?

17:46.250 --> 17:48.667
NO! NO, KISS.
I'M CUTTING THE
KISS. IT'S OUT.

17:48.667 --> 17:49.625
WAIT A SECOND, YOU
CAN'T CUT THE KISS.

17:49.625 --> 17:51.375
YES, I CAN.
I JUST DID,
ALL RIGHT?

17:51.375 --> 17:52.708
IT'S NOT WORKING.

17:52.708 --> 17:54.750
IT DOESN'T MAKE
SENSE FOR OUR
NEW CHARACTER

17:54.750 --> 17:57.083
TO BE KISSING
HER DEAD COUSIN'S
BOYFRIEND, RIGHT?

17:57.083 --> 17:58.458
THE KISS IS
OFFICIALLY CUT.

17:58.458 --> 17:59.708
ALL RIGHT,
SO THEN IS
THAT A WRAP?

17:59.708 --> 18:00.875
'CAUSE I GOT
PLANS TONIGHT,
YOU KNOW?

18:00.875 --> 18:01.875
YEAH, IT'S
A WRAP.

18:01.875 --> 18:03.583
YEAH, ACTUALLY, I
SHOULD GET GOING, TOO.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.667
BYE, YOU GUYS.

[SIGHS]

18:06.750 --> 18:10.291
AND, UH,
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO
THIS EVENING?

18:10.291 --> 18:12.125
WELL, IT JUST SO HAPPENS
THAT THE WOMAN OF MY DREAMS

18:12.125 --> 18:14.959
IS GONNA BE AT
THE SCHOOL DANCE TONIGHT,

18:14.959 --> 18:17.250
AND I PLAN ON ATTENDING.

18:17.250 --> 18:19.417
LUCKY HER.

18:19.417 --> 18:20.417
SO, IN HONOR OF
THE SCHOOL DANCE
TONIGHT,

18:20.417 --> 18:22.583
I'VE RENTED
SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER,

18:22.583 --> 18:23.125
STAYIN' ALIVE,
AND GREASE.

18:23.125 --> 18:24.583
IN LIEU OF GOING?

18:24.583 --> 18:28.875
YEAH. IT'LL BE
A JOHN TRAVOLTA NIGHT OF
INTERPRETIVE EXPRESSION.

18:28.875 --> 18:32.417
SEE, THIS WAY, WE
CAN DANCE AND OUR FEET
NEVER HAVE TO MOVE.

18:32.417 --> 18:34.417
I CAN'T, DAWSON.
I'M SORRY.

18:34.417 --> 18:36.333
YOU HAVE MORE
ENTICING PLANS?

18:36.333 --> 18:38.250
UH, ACTUALLY, I'M
GOING TO GO TO THE DANCE.

18:38.250 --> 18:39.834
OH.

18:39.834 --> 18:42.250
I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T
KNOW YOU WANTED TO DO
THE WHOLE MOVIE NIGHT THING.

18:42.250 --> 18:43.750
NO, IT'S OK.

18:43.750 --> 18:45.917
ARE YOU GOING--
ARE YOU GOING ALONE?

18:45.917 --> 18:48.792
NO. ACTUALLY, UH,
CLIFF ELLIOT ASKED ME.

18:48.792 --> 18:51.625
HE THOUGHT IT WOULD
BE A GOOD WAY FOR ME
TO MEET SOME NEW PEOPLE.

18:51.625 --> 18:53.417
ALL RIGHT.

18:53.417 --> 18:55.333
COME ON, DON'T
LOOK SO DOWN. IT'S NOT
LIKE A DATE OR ANYTHING.

18:55.333 --> 18:59.166
HE JUST ASKED ME
IF I WANTED TO GO
AND I SAID YES.

18:59.166 --> 19:02.333
OK, WELL,
CALL ME CONFUSED,

19:02.333 --> 19:04.834
BUT THAT'S
THE DEFINITION OF
A DATE, JEN, ISN'T IT?

19:04.834 --> 19:06.291
I KNOW.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:06.291 --> 19:08.291
UM, I JUST WANTED
TO GO, YOU KNOW.

19:08.291 --> 19:10.291
I MEAN--I MEAN,
I'M NEW HERE,

19:10.291 --> 19:13.250
AND IT JUST
SOUNDED LIKE FUN.

19:13.250 --> 19:16.792
WHY DON'T YOU DROP BY?
WE--WE COULD DANCE.

19:16.792 --> 19:18.792
NO. I GOT A DATE
WITH TRAVOLTA.

19:18.792 --> 19:19.834
I WOULDN'T WANT
TO DISAPPOINT HIM.

19:19.834 --> 19:22.291
WELL,
SEE YOU LATER.

19:22.291 --> 19:23.583
OK.

19:25.083 --> 19:26.291
SEE YA.

19:26.291 --> 19:27.458
BYE.

19:28.708 --> 19:30.250
CLIFF.

19:30.250 --> 19:31.792
CLIFF ELLIOT!

19:31.792 --> 19:33.708
WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?
I DON'T GET IT.

19:33.708 --> 19:35.166
HOW COULD SHE
BE ATTRACTED TO HIM?
WHAT'S HE GOT?

19:35.166 --> 19:36.708
WELL, WE COULD START WITH
HIS CHEST MEASUREMENT
AND WORK DOWN.

19:36.708 --> 19:38.625
NO, NO!

19:38.625 --> 19:40.667
NO, NO,
BEYOND THE EXTERNAL?

19:40.667 --> 19:43.333
THERE'S NOTHING
GOING ON UP HERE.
IT'S HEAD FUMES.

19:43.333 --> 19:45.750
THE GUY'S A LIGHTWEIGHT.
HIS SCRIPT'S LUDICROUS.

19:45.750 --> 19:47.583
HIS STORY SENSE
IS EVEN WORSE.

19:47.583 --> 19:48.834
I DON'T THINK HIS
CINEMATIC PROWESS IS
THE ATTRACTION, DAWSON.

19:48.834 --> 19:51.500
WHAT KILLS ME
IS SHE WAS SO OPEN
ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.000
LIKE, "WELL, I'M
GOING TO THE DANCE
WITH CLIFF."

19:53.000 --> 19:55.041
LIKE IT WOULDN'T
BOTHER ME.

19:55.041 --> 19:57.875
I RESPECT HER CANDOR
AND ALL, BUT IT'S A LITTLE
ON THE THOUGHTLESS SIDE.

19:57.875 --> 19:59.834
COMPLETELY THOUGHTLESS.

19:59.834 --> 20:03.208
AT THIS VERY MOMENT,
THEY'RE SLOW DANCING.

20:03.208 --> 20:04.792
HER ARMS ARE WRAPPED
AROUND HIS WAIST,

20:04.792 --> 20:06.834
AND THEY'RE MOVING
TO SOME STUPID, CHEESY
EIGHTIES SONG,

20:06.834 --> 20:08.333
AND HE'S WHISPERING
THINGS INTO HER EAR

20:08.333 --> 20:09.834
AND IT KIND OF MAKES
HER GIGGLE AND TOSS HER
HAIR OFF TO THE SIDE.

20:09.834 --> 20:14.291
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,
THEIR EYES MEET AND THEY
SHIFT AWKWARDLY,

20:14.291 --> 20:15.667
BECAUSE THEY KNOW

20:15.667 --> 20:17.250
IT'S COMING DOWN
TO THAT ONE MOMENT AT
THE END OF THE NIGHT

20:17.250 --> 20:19.208
WHERE HE LEANS OVER
AND TELLS HER WHAT
A GREAT TIME HE'S HAD.

20:19.208 --> 20:20.667
HE ASKS HER IF
THEY CAN DO IT AGAIN,

20:20.667 --> 20:22.750
AND SHE JUST SMILES
IN THAT SEXY, TEASING
WAY THAT SHE HAS--

20:22.750 --> 20:24.834
IT'S NOT REALLY
TEASING, BUT JUST SEXY--

20:24.834 --> 20:26.125
AND SAYS,
"I'D LIKE THAT."

20:26.125 --> 20:28.125
AND THEN
THEIR LIPS MEET,

20:28.125 --> 20:29.542
THEIR MOUTHS
COME TOGETHER,

20:29.542 --> 20:32.875
THEIR TONGUES

AAH! I CAN'T TAKE IT!

I DON'T GET IT.

I DON'T GET IT.

20:39.458 --> 20:41.250
WHAT DID HE DO
THAT I DIDN'T DO?

20:41.250 --> 20:43.792
HE ASKED HER OUT?

OF ANOTHER MAN.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.333
I MEAN, WHY
TORTURE YOURSELF?

20:56.333 --> 20:57.083

IS A PREREQUISITE.

ARE YOU COMING OR NOT?

UP THIS MORNING.

22:03.375 --> 22:04.500
MY MOM WAS THE BEST.

22:04.500 --> 22:07.458
SHE WAS
AN INCREDIBLE WOMAN.

22:07.458 --> 22:11.291
MY DAD, HOWEVER,
DIDN'T ALWAYS SEE THAT.

22:11.291 --> 22:13.125

AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER,
