Ackerman, he was really happy with, uh, the work I did.

06:08.466 --> 06:10.300
I mean, you know, I did a good job,

06:10.366 --> 06:12.433
just objectively speaking.

06:12.500 --> 06:15.300
Um, so anyway we merged the Tel Aviv office

06:15.366 --> 06:17.600
into the European division and he said,

06:17.666 --> 06:19.733
Ackerman, he was like, "Just take all of Europe."

06:49.000 --> 06:51.733
What did you tell Ackerman? Like, how did you leave it?

06:52.000 --> 06:55.066
I said that it-- you know, I needed to talk to you first.

06:55.133 --> 06:58.133
It was an amazing offer, but, you know,

06:58.200 --> 06:59.433
I needed to talk to you.

07:02.700 --> 07:05.133
Okay. So what are you--

07:05.200 --> 07:07.700
you're thinking that you're gonna go back to...

-flying here every other weekend to see Ava again? -No. No, of course not.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.466

Oh, all right. All right. So then what?

07:15.300 --> 07:16.366

07:43.400 --> 07:44.566
MIRA: Well, I don't have a concrete solution.

07:44.633 --> 07:46.033
That's why I was hoping we could hash it out together.

07:46.100 --> 07:47.166
Yeah, of course you don't have a concrete solution

07:47.233 --> 07:48.433
because there is no concrete solution.

07:48.500 --> 07:50.666
So why would you bring it up? Just to see how I'd react?

07:56.766 --> 07:58.000
Okay.

08:00.366 --> 08:01.400

08:37.566 --> 08:38.666
What do you want?

08:41.033 --> 08:44.100
I was-- Okay. I was thinking that, um...

08:46.333 --> 08:49.566
maybe the two of you could come to London.

08:50.366 --> 08:52.600
Like, uh, Ava and you.

08:57.100 --> 08:59.000
I thought that could be a possibility.

09:13.133 --> 09:16.500

09:16.566 --> 09:19.133
And we could do shared custody, like we do here.

09:21.366 --> 09:24.433
London's the perfect place for you to write.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.400

Of course I'm gonna rule it out. What do you-- what--

what, do you think that we're just like a suitcase

I don't know why it came out like that. It just did.

27:38.333 --> 27:40.233
The whole point is that you're just supposed to...

27:40.733 --> 27:42.500
to go with the flow.

27:44.566 --> 27:46.233
Okay. Um... (CLEARS THROAT)

"Apparently, his obsessive rational thinking

27:50.766 --> 27:55.733
at that age was only compensation

27:56.000 --> 27:58.533
for all the anxieties.

27:58.600 --> 28:02.433
Because there was the father, this dominant father

28:02.500 --> 28:05.033
casting a shadow over him,

28:05.100 --> 28:09.166
judgmental, with strict moral codes,

28:09.233 --> 28:11.633
and he--" Meaning me.

28:11.700 --> 28:12.666
MIRA: Mm.

28:12.733 --> 28:16.133
Uh, "Tried so hard to please this father,

28:16.200 --> 28:18.366
to live up to his standards,

28:18.433 --> 28:20.533
but he always felt like he'd failed,

28:20.600 --> 28:25.566
so that, gradually, he developed this permanent feeling

28:25.633 --> 28:31.066
of 'I'm not good enough, I'm not moral enough,

28:31.133 --> 28:33.300
I'm too egocentric,'

28:33.366 --> 28:35.433
which, in the world he grew up in,

28:35.500 --> 28:37.300
is the worst possible sin.

28:40.200 --> 28:42.700
And on the other hand, there was the mother,

28:42.766 --> 28:46.733
who was always too weak to face down this tough father.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.300
But she was such an anxious person herself

28:49.366 --> 28:53.600
that even with her, this boy, he couldn't really be himself,

28:53.666 --> 28:56.033
he couldn't share his hardships, his fears,

28:56.100 --> 28:59.266
because she'd immediately get so overwhelmed

28:59.333 --> 29:02.333
that her anxiety would only compound his.

29:02.400 --> 29:05.366
And then, when he realized no one actually saw him,

29:05.433 --> 29:07.433
his true self that is,

29:07.500 --> 29:11.200
no one could help him cope with everything he was going through,

29:11.266 --> 29:14.000
he fell deeper and deeper into himself,

29:14.066 --> 29:17.000
and kept all of his pain and anxiety inside,

29:17.066 --> 29:19.166
and never told anyone anything,

29:19.233 --> 29:21.233
and this split inside him

29:21.300 --> 29:24.133
wouldn't let him truly be in a relationship,

29:24.200 --> 29:26.466
because there was always part of him that he kept hidden,

29:27.300 --> 29:29.000
he was never fully present,

29:30.100 --> 29:31.266
until Mira showed up.

29:33.366 --> 29:37.366
And to a certain extent, she saved him by seeing him.

29:37.433 --> 29:41.233
For the first time in his life, he felt like he might be pulled

29:41.300 --> 29:43.566
out of the inherent loneliness.

29:46.400 --> 29:50.700
But only after she left did he realize how,

29:50.766 --> 29:55.400
even with her, he was there-not-there,

29:55.466 --> 29:58.100
and how hard it must have been to live with this,

29:58.166 --> 30:01.266
with someone who was always partly somewhere else,

30:01.333 --> 30:03.366
inside his own head,

30:03.433 --> 30:07.266
how that could make her feel lonely and unseen.

30:07.333 --> 30:11.766
And this realization helped him deal with her leaving him,

30:12.466 --> 30:14.466
to make sense of it,

30:14.533 --> 30:16.533
and that disabused him of the idea

30:16.600 --> 30:21.233
that he'd been a victim of some kind of sudden cataclysm."

47:42.433 --> 47:44.166
-over a couple texts-- -JONATHAN: Enough!

47:45.266 --> 47:46.266
Enough!

48:00.666 --> 48:03.066
Can I just say something to you, Mira?

48:03.433 --> 48:04.533
Truthfully...

48:06.000 --> 48:10.633
I'm not buying your whole "ode to solitude" thing.

48:10.700 --> 48:12.566
Okay? It's bullshit.

48:13.700 --> 48:16.000
And I don't believe that you believe in it.

48:17.166 --> 48:21.033
It's a weakness. It's fear. It's not strength.

48:21.100 --> 48:24.333
And I don't know what's gonna happen to you if you can't--

48:24.400 --> 48:26.533
I'm not-- I'm not trying to be patronizing,

48:26.600 --> 48:31.033
but I can see that your chaos and your detachment--

48:31.100 --> 48:33.766
your total detachment and...

48:42.066 --> 48:45.233
I remember how-- how we were back then

48:45.300 --> 48:47.166
before we moved in together

48:48.066 --> 48:50.066
and what we saved ourselves from.

48:52.600 --> 48:55.400
How we pulled each other out of exactly--

48:55.466 --> 48:59.033
exactly that loneliness that you're talking about.

49:00.566 --> 49:05.200
It wasn't an illusion, and you know it.

49:09.233 --> 49:10.500
It was a miracle.

49:10.566 --> 49:13.500
It was like the biggest miracle of our lives.

49:18.300 --> 49:20.366
And we're just like throwing it all away.

49:22.333 --> 49:24.600
And it's... it's...

49:26.333 --> 49:28.466
It's just, like, it's a terrible mistake.

49:28.533 --> 49:31.066
It's terrible. And...

49:31.133 --> 49:33.533
We should-- I don't know.

49:33.600 --> 49:35.666
We should've just done everything we could to...

49:37.533 --> 49:38.600
to...

49:40.500 --> 49:42.433
save it, to not just give up.

49:49.400 --> 49:51.033
I can't, uh...

49:54.600 --> 49:56.366
I don't know how to...

50:00.266 --> 50:01.533
(GROANS)

50:04.000 --> 50:05.366
I'm really nauseous.

50:12.766 --> 50:14.766
Something is fucked up with me.

50:19.233 --> 50:21.500
Something inside is so fucked up.

50:36.600 --> 50:38.000
(SIGHS)

50:43.366 --> 50:44.700
Can I play you something?

50:47.333 --> 50:48.466
MIRA: Play something?

50:49.433 --> 50:51.200
Yeah. It's...

50:51.266 --> 50:53.300
It's a voicemail I got this morning.

50:55.733 --> 50:57.300
Just hold on a second.

51:01.033 --> 51:02.766
POLI: (ON PHONE) Hey, Jonathan. It's Poli.

51:03.033 --> 51:05.366
Um, I'm in the airport right now,

51:05.433 --> 51:07.400
I'm going for a week, so, uh...

51:08.133 --> 51:09.700
uh, listen...

51:09.766 --> 51:13.333
I know that Mira is going to meet you tonight, okay?

51:13.400 --> 51:15.566
I don't know what you're going to do together.

51:15.633 --> 51:18.600
It's a free country, you're still married,

51:18.666 --> 51:20.533
legally, so...

51:21.600 --> 51:23.400
(LAUGHS)  I'm just saying,

51:23.466 --> 51:26.100
this whole fucking situation here...

51:26.166 --> 51:30.233
The suspicions and, uh, the fights and all that...

51:30.300 --> 51:32.600
It-- it's just not for me.

51:32.666 --> 51:35.333
You two sit together, talk,

51:35.400 --> 51:37.600
decide what you wanna do with each other.

51:37.666 --> 51:39.400
I had enough.

51:39.466 --> 51:42.366
Uh, if she wants to come back to you, believe me,

51:42.433 --> 51:45.566
I'm the last person to stop her, okay?

51:45.633 --> 51:47.766
And you can share this with Mira if you want.

51:48.033 --> 51:50.600
She probably told you everything anyway, so...

51:50.666 --> 51:53.200
-just, uh, keep me posted. -Ava. Hey!

51:53.266 --> 51:55.466
-Hi, babe! -Where's Poli?

51:56.400 --> 51:58.633
Poli? Um... Poli's not here.

51:58.700 --> 52:00.466
We're at Daddy's house, honey.

52:00.533 --> 52:03.233
But I'm hungry, and I want Poli to make me pancakes.

52:03.300 --> 52:04.766
Sweetie, we don't eat in the middle of the night.

52:05.033 --> 52:07.200
-Okay? Come here. -But Poli lets me.

52:07.266 --> 52:09.000
JONATHAN: Yeah? Does he?

52:09.066 --> 52:10.533
Well, you know what? Let's go lay down

52:10.600 --> 52:12.000
and we'll try to sleep,

52:12.066 --> 52:14.000
and if you're still hungry, we'll make a snack. Okay, honey?

52:15.066 --> 52:16.000
All right?

52:16.066 --> 52:18.266
But can I sleep in your bed, Mommy?

52:19.466 --> 52:22.133
Oh, my... Tomorrow you can.

52:23.366 --> 52:25.433
-Promise, tomorrow. -Come on. Let's go lie down.

52:25.500 --> 52:27.133
I'll lie down next to you, all right?

52:27.200 --> 52:28.733
Come give Mommy a big good night kiss.

52:29.766 --> 52:31.000
Love you.

52:31.066 --> 52:32.433
All right. Let's go.

52:33.466 --> 52:34.666
One second, all right?

52:34.733 --> 52:36.066
MIRA: Sure.

52:36.133 --> 52:40.000
JONATHAN: Yeah, just... There we go.

52:40.066 --> 52:41.366
All right.

52:42.700 --> 52:45.133
'Bout I sing you a little dream song?

52:48.200 --> 52:50.033
AVA LEVY: I don't wanna go to sleep yet.

52:50.100 --> 52:51.566
JONATHAN: Of course you don't wanna go to sleep yet.

52:51.633 --> 52:53.200
We're not gonna go to sleep, okay?

52:53.266 --> 52:54.600
I'm just gonna sing a song.
