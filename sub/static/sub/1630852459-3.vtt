00:13.763 --> 00:18.560
In 1980, I was a beat reporter
in Bergen County with<i> The Record,</i>

00:18.643 --> 00:23.314
covering Hasbrouck Heights,
covering Lodi, New Jersey.

00:25.734 --> 00:28.361
The call came
that there was an incident

00:28.445 --> 00:30.488
at the Quality Inn in Hasbrouck Heights.

00:32.240 --> 00:35.285
And of course,
it was my responsibility to respond to it.

00:39.205 --> 00:44.919
A woman screamed loud enough
for the hotel personnel, uh, to hear it

00:45.003 --> 00:48.006
and to, uh,
come to the room and knock on the door.

00:52.677 --> 00:55.430
She managed to make a hand signal

00:57.057 --> 00:59.225
to whoever was there in the hallway.

01:01.770 --> 01:04.522
The hotel staff realized
that she was in trouble.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.110
And so, right away, they call the police.

01:09.861 --> 01:12.697
At this point, he's in a panic.

01:12.781 --> 01:14.908
He knows the jig is up.
He's gotta get out of there.

01:16.117 --> 01:19.329
He attempts
to make a run for it down the hallway.

01:19.954 --> 01:21.289
All of a sudden,

01:21.372 --> 01:24.959
a Hasbrouck Heights police officer
came in, threw him down…

01:25.043 --> 01:28.171
…told him to stop,
raise his hands,

01:28.254 --> 01:30.882
said, "If you don't stop,
I'm gonna blow you away."

01:33.343 --> 01:34.469
He did stop,

01:35.970 --> 01:38.056
and he dropped everything in the hallway.

01:40.725 --> 01:42.977
When they grabbed this perpetrator,

01:43.728 --> 01:47.440
in his possession, he's got… tape.

01:48.149 --> 01:50.068
He's got handcuffs.

01:50.151 --> 01:52.445
He's got bondage restraints.

01:52.529 --> 01:54.364
He's got sedatives.

01:55.615 --> 01:58.159
Police question Leslie Ann O'Dell,

01:58.243 --> 02:01.746
and she told the police
everything that he was doing to her.

02:01.830 --> 02:04.124
She accused him of sexual assault

02:04.207 --> 02:08.753
and said it was when
he put handcuffs on her and threatened her

02:08.837 --> 02:11.256
that she was afraid
she was gonna be killed.

02:11.339 --> 02:14.217
But when police question the suspect,

02:14.300 --> 02:17.887
he made it sound like
he wasn't really at fault.

02:17.971 --> 02:21.015
He said that she was there willingly,

02:21.099 --> 02:23.893
so there was no crime
that had been committed.

02:23.977 --> 02:26.563
But for the police
in New Jersey,

02:26.646 --> 02:28.731
right away, alarm bells are ringing.

02:29.607 --> 02:31.651
This is the same hotel.

02:31.734 --> 02:35.113
Two women, they were killed there earlier.

02:35.947 --> 02:37.365
This has gotta be the same guy.

02:38.700 --> 02:41.119
So the police
put him under arrest,

02:41.202 --> 02:44.664
and they took him to police headquarters…

02:47.041 --> 02:48.877


02:48.960 --> 02:52.672
…and learned that his name
was Richard Cottingham.

02:52.755 --> 02:54.757


02:56.176 --> 02:57.177


03:31.669 --> 03:35.173
In New York City,
with the Midtown torso case,

03:37.008 --> 03:40.220
the case
was basically stalled in the water.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.894
There was no further information…

03:50.980 --> 03:53.024
because the investigation

03:53.608 --> 03:56.027
didn't lead to any… any suspects.

03:57.570 --> 04:00.657
Now, you gotta remember something.
It's the early '80s.

04:00.740 --> 04:03.368
There wasn't any communication
between agencies.

04:05.036 --> 04:08.748
And so just a few days
after the murder of Jean Ann Reyner,

04:09.749 --> 04:11.584
authorities in New York City,

04:11.668 --> 04:16.673
they had no idea that a suspect
with the same MO as the Torso Killer

04:17.340 --> 04:21.219
had been arrested for assaulting
a prostitute across the river

04:21.302 --> 04:22.595
in New Jersey.

04:26.349 --> 04:30.520
Richard Cottingham
had been locked up in Bergen County

04:30.603 --> 04:33.731
for the attack against,
uh, Leslie Ann O'Dell.

04:36.776 --> 04:40.780
And Jersey police thought
that he might be the serial killer

04:40.863 --> 04:42.657
they had been looking for,

04:43.491 --> 04:48.579
who murdered Valerie Street
and Maryann Carr at the Quality Inn.

04:50.373 --> 04:52.250
So Bergen County

04:52.333 --> 04:54.252
began building their case,

04:55.003 --> 04:58.506
connecting him with earlier crimes.

04:59.132 --> 05:04.012
They learned that Richard Cottingham
was living in nearby Lodi, New Jersey,

05:05.054 --> 05:07.432
which is adjacent to Hasbrouck Heights,

05:08.474 --> 05:10.977
where the Quality Inn was located.

05:12.895 --> 05:15.231
Police had also learned

05:16.107 --> 05:18.818
that Maryann Carr was abducted

05:18.901 --> 05:22.530
from the same apartment complex
where Richard Cottingham lived

05:22.613 --> 05:25.533
about five years earlier
before her abduction.

05:26.659 --> 05:30.413
In all these cases,
there's the use of handcuffs,

05:31.331 --> 05:34.250
two victims with strangulation,

05:34.334 --> 05:38.421
two victims with adhesive remains
around their mouths.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.173
So we're having a pattern here.

05:40.965 --> 05:44.177
And they felt very confident
this guy might be related.

05:44.677 --> 05:47.305
But there's a lot of things
working against the investigators.

05:48.181 --> 05:52.060
They didn't have enough evidence
to support the prosecutor's case.

05:52.560 --> 05:56.022
'Cause you not only wanna arrest this guy,
you need to convict him.

05:56.105 --> 06:00.568
You have to build a solid case
of credible information…

06:02.153 --> 06:05.365
…using evidence and statements

06:05.448 --> 06:08.993
from surviving victims,
like Leslie Ann O'Dell.

06:10.453 --> 06:13.456
Because this
is a serial killer case, in particular,

06:13.539 --> 06:14.999
detectives are looking into

06:15.083 --> 06:17.126
if something similar happened
to someone else.

06:17.877 --> 06:20.963
Because if you have other survivors,

06:21.047 --> 06:22.757
then you have more witnesses,

06:23.800 --> 06:28.888
which would help determine a pattern
of what this guy does and how he does it.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.766
How did he approach her?

06:31.849 --> 06:33.226
What did he say?

06:33.851 --> 06:35.603
How did the evening progress?

06:36.104 --> 06:37.605
When did it go bad?

06:37.688 --> 06:39.524
These little details

06:39.607 --> 06:41.734
can link different crimes together.

06:41.818 --> 06:43.694
It can make or break the case.

06:44.987 --> 06:50.118
The Bergen County investigators
found a lot of unsolved rape-assault cases

06:50.201 --> 06:52.703
where they were picked up
from New York City,

06:52.787 --> 06:55.581
brought to New Jersey, and almost killed.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.592
<i>When I became conscious,</i>

07:06.676 --> 07:11.264
<i>I was lying naked in a sewer</i>
<i>at an apartment complex.</i>

07:11.848 --> 07:16.310
The night before, she was approached
at a bar in New York City.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.230
<i>He started talking to me,</i>

07:20.148 --> 07:22.400
<i>and he asked me</i>
<i>what I was doing there alone.</i>

07:22.900 --> 07:24.902
He offered to buy her a drink.

07:26.154 --> 07:28.406
<i>He asked me</i>
<i>if I was a working girl.</i>

07:28.489 --> 07:30.700
<i>I told him that I was a waitress.</i>

07:31.242 --> 07:34.454
The drink was loaded,
and she began to feel ill.

07:34.537 --> 07:37.582
She left the bar, he followed her,
offered her a ride home.

07:38.166 --> 07:39.417
She got into the car,

07:39.959 --> 07:42.837
and before you know it,
they were driving into New Jersey.

07:43.504 --> 07:45.256
<i>I kept passing out.</i>

07:45.756 --> 07:47.508
When she came conscious,

07:47.592 --> 07:50.970
she had been severely,
uh, bitten on the breast.

07:51.053 --> 07:54.015
She had been beaten
and sexually assaulted.

07:54.515 --> 07:57.310
<i>I woke up in a dark area,</i>

07:57.393 --> 08:01.814
<i>and he told me,</i>
<i>"Don't worry, I used to live here."</i>

08:13.451 --> 08:16.287
<i>When I came to,</i>
<i>my attacker was gone.</i>

08:17.038 --> 08:18.581
<i>He took my jewelry.</i>

08:18.664 --> 08:20.041
<i>I could barely move.</i>

08:20.541 --> 08:22.168
<i>I hurt all over.</i>

08:23.294 --> 08:24.670
The night before,

08:24.754 --> 08:27.381
a female prostitute named Susan Geiger

08:28.090 --> 08:30.676
was approached near Broadway in Manhattan.

08:31.552 --> 08:33.429
<i>He asked me</i>
<i>if I was a working girl.</i>

08:33.513 --> 08:35.598
<i>I told him I was. I needed the money.</i>

08:36.265 --> 08:40.228
This individual asked her
to come with him, and she was busy.

08:40.311 --> 08:43.147
Gets her to agree
to meet him the next night,

08:44.148 --> 08:45.650
and she does. She comes.

08:46.567 --> 08:48.986
<i> He says,</i>
<i>"Let's go have a couple drinks."</i>

08:49.070 --> 08:51.572
<i>He knew of a nice place, Flanagans.</i>

08:53.699 --> 08:57.328
<i>He said he worked with computers,</i>
<i>lived in New Jersey.</i>

08:58.329 --> 09:01.666
And once he had her, he drugged her.

09:01.749 --> 09:04.460
He drugged her,
and he brought her to New Jersey…

09:04.544 --> 09:08.172
<i>I started feeling drowsy,</i>
<i>tired, sleepy.</i>

09:08.256 --> 09:13.886
…where the assailant bit her breasts
and caused horrendous injuries.

09:14.470 --> 09:16.472
She'd been sexually assaulted.

09:17.098 --> 09:19.433
Susan Geiger was left for dead,

09:20.017 --> 09:22.019
and by the grace of God, she lived.

09:33.864 --> 09:38.035
<i>I woke up in a parking lot</i>
<i>and had no idea what had happened.</i>

09:38.661 --> 09:39.912
The night before,

09:39.996 --> 09:42.957
the offender spotted her
on the street in Times Square.

09:43.708 --> 09:46.085
<i>He had a big fat bankroll.</i>

09:46.168 --> 09:48.462
<i>He told me it was $3,000,</i>

09:49.005 --> 09:52.383
<i>and he said, "I want</i>
<i>to spend the whole night with you."</i>

09:52.466 --> 09:55.136
This guy was waving these wads of cash,

09:56.345 --> 09:58.222
asking for sex acts.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.727
<i>In the bar, he kept insisting</i>
<i>that I drink with him.</i>

10:02.810 --> 10:05.896
<i>He kept touching my breasts</i>
<i>the whole time.</i>

10:06.564 --> 10:07.898
<i>He was rough.</i>

10:08.733 --> 10:11.694
And then he drugged her,
and he brought her to New Jersey,

10:13.404 --> 10:17.325
where she reported
a horrific beating and sexual assault.

10:22.163 --> 10:23.873
All of these cases…

10:25.166 --> 10:26.709
had several parallels.

10:28.002 --> 10:30.212
The victims found
in New Jersey

10:30.296 --> 10:34.800
were abducted from an area
in New York City

10:34.884 --> 10:38.387
where Richard Cottingham worked
at Blue Cross.

10:39.847 --> 10:43.059
Karen Schilt,
she was found in the parking lot

10:43.142 --> 10:46.437
of the Ledgewood apartments
in Little Ferry,

10:47.480 --> 10:49.607
which was Maryann Carr's apartment,

10:50.858 --> 10:52.652
where Cottingham used to live.

10:55.363 --> 10:57.740
The attack of Pamela Weisenfeld

10:57.823 --> 11:00.660
was a couple days
before the assault of Leslie O'Dell.

11:02.411 --> 11:05.998
Also, this perpetrator,
he was drugging them.

11:07.166 --> 11:11.837
And Richard Cottingham
had sedatives in his possession.

11:13.798 --> 11:16.717
And all the injuries were so similar.

11:18.219 --> 11:21.681
Now, Bergen County investigators
need each new victim

11:21.764 --> 11:26.519
to try to identify Richard Cottingham
as their attacker and rapist.

11:28.562 --> 11:30.439
But it's sometimes difficult.

11:32.191 --> 11:35.236
Previously,
in the 1970s,

11:35.319 --> 11:39.699
many women would be wary to come forward

11:39.782 --> 11:43.160
because rape victims
were treated horribly by the law.

11:43.244 --> 11:45.371
New York law was particularly onerous.

11:45.454 --> 11:47.707
Even if a woman could identify the rapist,

11:47.790 --> 11:51.377
if you did not have a witness to your rape
who was willing to get on the stand

11:51.460 --> 11:53.754
and say, "Yes, I saw this person raped,"

11:53.838 --> 11:56.132
then they could not get a conviction.

11:56.215 --> 11:58.718
But also, if you're a sex worker,

11:58.801 --> 12:01.345
the police officer would arrest you

12:01.846 --> 12:04.849
for having said you were a sex worker.

12:04.932 --> 12:07.518
And at the time in New York,

12:07.601 --> 12:10.020
they were cracking down
on the sex industry.

12:11.230 --> 12:14.316
The main focus of the Office
of Midtown Enforcement in Times Square

12:14.400 --> 12:16.736
is the elimination of prostitution.

12:18.154 --> 12:20.865
For so long,
only women were arrested

12:20.948 --> 12:23.284
for the crime of prostitution.

12:23.367 --> 12:24.577
Men would not be,

12:24.660 --> 12:28.873
even though the law said that soliciting
was a non-gendered offense.

12:29.457 --> 12:33.502
The girl is taking the brunt
of the entire bust.

12:34.253 --> 12:35.963
Double standard? Absolutely.

12:38.716 --> 12:42.011
I was arrested all these dozens
of times in New York City.

12:42.511 --> 12:45.848
The men, the clients, the johns,
the tricks, whatever you wanna call them,

12:46.974 --> 12:48.350
they were never rounded up.

12:48.434 --> 12:51.312
The traffickers or pimps,
they were never rounded up.

12:51.937 --> 12:54.648
<i> In most cases,</i>
<i>a summons was issued,</i>

12:54.732 --> 12:56.692
<i>and the violator was on his way.</i>

12:58.068 --> 13:01.572
But in the late 1970s, early 1980s…

13:03.115 --> 13:05.951
…the feminist movement was getting bigger.

13:06.035 --> 13:08.204
<i>Today's marchers</i>
<i>were celebrating the growth</i>

13:08.287 --> 13:11.499
<i>of the women's movement</i>
<i>from a small band of dedicated feminists</i>

13:11.582 --> 13:15.503
<i>into a full-scale movement</i>
<i>involving women of all kinds.</i>

13:16.212 --> 13:18.839
And so, as a result,

13:18.923 --> 13:23.344
there were lots of new developments
in the way of policing,

13:23.427 --> 13:28.390
and what began to happen was let's catch
the men who are doing all of this.

13:29.308 --> 13:32.520
<i>By the new law,</i>
<i>it is now a misdemeanor</i>.

13:32.603 --> 13:35.940
<i>When arrested,</i>
<i>a so-called john will be fingerprinted,</i>

13:36.023 --> 13:39.109
<i>photographed, and held in a cell</i>
<i>until his arraignment.</i>

13:40.069 --> 13:44.073
-What do you think of that law?
-Well, uh, it's fair, but being a man,

13:44.156 --> 13:46.784
I'm a little biased
as to how I feel about it.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.285
But, uh, definitely fair

13:48.369 --> 13:50.412
if you wanna cut down the traffic
in Times Square.

13:50.496 --> 13:52.206
Well, there should be equity
under the law.

13:52.289 --> 13:54.166
What goes for the woman
ought to go for the man.

13:54.250 --> 13:57.711
One of the things
that happened with the women's movement

13:57.795 --> 14:01.257
was that women now
were feeling that they could

14:01.340 --> 14:05.094
and should determine sexual consent.

14:06.136 --> 14:08.472
Rape laws began to be changed,

14:08.556 --> 14:12.142
and women understood now
that what was happening to them

14:12.226 --> 14:14.186
was not right,

14:14.770 --> 14:18.023
and they began to advocate for themselves.

14:18.107 --> 14:22.862
And rape crimes could no longer
be swept under the rug, forgotten.

14:24.822 --> 14:27.157
And so in Bergen County…

14:28.617 --> 14:30.452
…these other victims

14:30.536 --> 14:33.873
who were also attacked
by Richard Cottingham

14:33.956 --> 14:38.043
now feel it is the right time

14:38.127 --> 14:41.088
to come forward and give their story

14:41.171 --> 14:44.258
as to what happened to them,
that they will be listened to.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.265
And so, uh, they came forward

14:51.348 --> 14:54.852
to try and identify the guy
who attacked them.

14:55.978 --> 14:58.647
However, by the time
it came time for the lineup,

14:59.648 --> 15:01.400
Cottingham shaved off his mustache

15:01.483 --> 15:03.694
and looks
like a completely different person.

15:04.528 --> 15:06.530
He was trying to prevent identification.

15:07.865 --> 15:11.493
Tell you the truth, if I wasn't a cop,
I'd have trouble ID'ing him in the lineup.

15:11.577 --> 15:13.245
He looked completely different.

15:14.747 --> 15:19.960
But Susan Geiger,
Pamela Weisenfeld, and Karen Schilt

15:20.044 --> 15:22.838
were able to identify Richard Cottingham.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.806
And now in New Jersey<i>,</i>

15:33.515 --> 15:37.311
the media was reporting
on Richard Cottingham as the suspect

15:37.394 --> 15:40.314
with the victims found in Bergen County.

15:46.070 --> 15:48.656
Very quickly, the NYPD

15:49.698 --> 15:53.994
sees Richard Cottingham
being written about.

15:55.079 --> 15:59.166
They discover similarities
between the two cases

16:00.209 --> 16:01.669
and start thinking

16:02.378 --> 16:05.881
maybe Richard Cottingham's
the Times Square Torso Killer.

16:06.548 --> 16:08.092
This is what broke the case.

16:08.676 --> 16:10.719
Now these detectives are working together.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.263
They're talking, cooperating,

16:13.347 --> 16:16.976
examining everything,
comparing everything,

16:17.059 --> 16:18.477
putting the cases together.

16:18.560 --> 16:22.856
So the Bergen County prosecutor's
office executed a search warrant

16:22.940 --> 16:25.442
on the home of Richard Cottingham.

16:27.903 --> 16:31.240
When they entered his house
in Lodi, New Jersey,

16:31.323 --> 16:35.202
the investigators uncovered
a private room in his house,

16:35.285 --> 16:37.621
and that was a big, big find.

16:38.622 --> 16:41.625
It was a room that was down
in the basement of the house.

16:42.126 --> 16:45.546
He could go there.
He… he could lock the door and be alone,

16:46.338 --> 16:49.591
away from his wife,
who had filed for divorce.

16:50.467 --> 16:54.304
And what they found
made everybody's head spin.

16:55.431 --> 16:57.433
He had pornographic artwork,

16:59.101 --> 17:00.352
adhesive tape,

17:02.104 --> 17:03.689
books about S&M.

17:05.983 --> 17:10.571
They find
all these women's clothing, purses…

17:12.448 --> 17:15.534
Inside that room, he had a vault.

17:16.243 --> 17:18.704
A lockbox, uh, that he kept things in.

17:20.289 --> 17:23.125
They found what turned out
to be the actual key

17:23.208 --> 17:26.462
for Maryann Carr's apartment,
which he wouldn't have had access to

17:26.545 --> 17:28.797
unless he had gotten access
to Maryann Carr.

17:30.549 --> 17:35.012
They found a little koala bear.
It belonged to Valerie Ann Street.

17:36.472 --> 17:40.726
The police had discovered
what became known as the trophy room.

17:42.061 --> 17:45.105
A trophy is evidence
of a successful hunt.

17:46.440 --> 17:49.318
And lo and behold, there was a necklace

17:50.569 --> 17:51.987
of Jean Ann Reyner,

17:52.488 --> 17:54.865
the victim found at the Hotel Seville.

17:55.532 --> 17:58.535
The same necklace
from her arrest photograph

17:58.619 --> 18:00.120
is right there.

18:03.707 --> 18:07.086
All of a sudden,
they had evidence linking this guy

18:07.169 --> 18:10.172
who was torturing and killing women
in Bergen County, New Jersey,

18:10.255 --> 18:13.717
to the famous Torso Killer of New York.

18:14.843 --> 18:17.346
And now, for Richard Cottingham,

18:17.846 --> 18:20.140
his house of cards began to collapse.

18:23.477 --> 18:26.105
Last winter, we told you about
several especially brutal murders

18:26.188 --> 18:28.023
of alleged prostitutes here in New York,

18:28.107 --> 18:29.900
And so far,
the murders have gone unsolved.

18:29.983 --> 18:32.778
But now there may be
a major break in that case.

18:33.445 --> 18:36.031
The man they want
is 33-year-old Richard Cottingham,

18:36.115 --> 18:38.492
a Lodi, New Jersey computer operator.

18:38.575 --> 18:42.287
And right now, Cottingham
is being held on $350,000 bail

18:42.371 --> 18:44.873
in connection with the murder
of an alleged prostitute

18:44.957 --> 18:47.876
at the Quality Inn
in Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey.

18:55.259 --> 18:56.677
When I came to work,

18:56.760 --> 19:00.305
and we found out
that Richie was arrested in New Jersey,

19:01.098 --> 19:02.432
we were all shocked.

19:03.267 --> 19:06.728
And we just kept learning about
more killings and more killings.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.355
Not just the murders,

19:08.438 --> 19:11.483
but the taking apart the body
and… and things like that.

19:11.567 --> 19:13.152
I-- It was horrific.

19:13.735 --> 19:16.572
Thinking back
to all the stories about the prostitutes

19:16.655 --> 19:18.949
and how he would lure them to New Jersey,

19:19.032 --> 19:21.034
we didn't hear of him hurting them.

19:21.118 --> 19:24.371
Nobody reported him on any--
We didn't know what was going on with him.

19:24.872 --> 19:26.707
All we know is what he told us.

19:26.790 --> 19:30.335
As days went by, when the shock wore off,

19:30.419 --> 19:33.046
after I was questioned by the police,

19:34.256 --> 19:35.674
then the bell went off in my head.

19:36.258 --> 19:38.927
This diagram that he drew for me,

19:40.596 --> 19:43.307
I cannot explain why I kept it.

19:43.807 --> 19:45.184
It was just there,

19:45.976 --> 19:49.521
laying with a bunch of crap in a drawer.

19:49.605 --> 19:51.231
And I gave it to them.

19:52.149 --> 19:53.817
I wanted to get him bad.

19:55.068 --> 19:58.071
There are 19 charges pending
against Richard Cottingham,

19:58.155 --> 20:01.742
a 34-year-old computer programmer
from Lodi, New Jersey.

20:01.825 --> 20:03.118
The major charge is murder.

20:03.202 --> 20:06.872
The murder of Valerie Ann Street,
a 19-year-old prostitute,

20:06.955 --> 20:09.750
who Cottingham
allegedly picked up in New York City

20:09.833 --> 20:11.585
on May 4th of 1980.

20:12.169 --> 20:15.631
The charges are as long
as your arm, you know.

20:16.757 --> 20:20.928
In New Jersey, there was
administrating noxious substances.

20:21.011 --> 20:25.599
There was possession
of illegal prescriptions, pharmaceuticals.

20:25.682 --> 20:28.852
There was possession of, um… a knife.

20:29.561 --> 20:32.940
And, of course,
there was the rape, abduction, and assault

20:33.023 --> 20:37.236
of Leslie O'Dell,
Susan Geiger, Karen Schilt,

20:37.319 --> 20:40.280
and the abduction of Pamela Weisenfeld,

20:40.822 --> 20:43.492
and the murder of Valerie Street.

20:48.497 --> 20:50.249
At the risk of sounding vain,

20:50.332 --> 20:52.918
my reputation was I was the best lawyer,

20:53.001 --> 20:56.004
not only in Bergen County,
but North Jersey for sure.

20:57.172 --> 21:02.928
Every time a newspaper article would refer
to a significant crime in the county,

21:03.011 --> 21:04.763
I was waiting for my phone to ring.

21:05.555 --> 21:09.851
I remember the initial contact
that Mrs. Cottingham made with me.

21:09.935 --> 21:11.436
She said right at the outset,

21:11.520 --> 21:14.815
"Mr. Conway, I've been referred to you
to represent my son."

21:14.898 --> 21:18.151
"My son did not do anything wrong."

21:18.652 --> 21:23.699
Mr. Cottingham was so determined
to prove that he's innocent,

21:23.782 --> 21:25.450
he insisted on going to trial.

21:39.923 --> 21:42.884
What makes this historically
an interesting trial,

21:42.968 --> 21:45.721
it's one of the first trials
that I know of

21:45.804 --> 21:49.850
where signature evidence was presented.

21:49.933 --> 21:54.187
Um… Dennis Calo,
the prosecutor at that time,

21:54.271 --> 21:57.482
was arguing that

21:58.692 --> 22:02.946
Cottingham's signature
was the abduction, the handcuffing,

22:03.030 --> 22:06.325
the taping of his victims,

22:07.326 --> 22:08.785
the mutilation.

22:09.619 --> 22:13.540
He would run that knife
along the body of the women,

22:13.623 --> 22:18.920
um… in order to, uh, bring,
uh, them into a state of fear.

22:19.004 --> 22:22.924
You know, the signature is the same
even though the MO is different.

22:24.301 --> 22:27.554
One victim is stabbed,
another one is strangled.

22:28.096 --> 22:30.682
Some were found outside.

22:30.766 --> 22:33.060
Other victims are found inside.

22:33.560 --> 22:37.439
He may commit these crimes
in different ways,

22:37.522 --> 22:39.024
but the signature is the same.

22:39.107 --> 22:42.861
And that was very advanced at that time.

22:46.990 --> 22:49.409
And then
the prosecutor brought out

22:49.493 --> 22:52.079
a number of victims who lived to testify.

22:52.829 --> 22:54.748
And… and their testimony was crucial.

22:55.999 --> 23:01.380
<i> I have the vague memory</i>
<i>of, like, being burnt on my breast.</i>

23:01.463 --> 23:02.714
<i>Like, really hurting.</i>

23:03.965 --> 23:05.550
<i>I felt like I was dead.</i>

23:06.760 --> 23:11.807
<i>He said I was going</i>
<i>to pay for being a whore, like the others.</i>

23:12.641 --> 23:14.851
<i>And if I did anything</i>
<i>he didn't want me to,</i>

23:15.602 --> 23:17.479
<i>he would… kill me.</i>

23:19.147 --> 23:21.274
<i>I remember being in a hotel room</i>

23:21.775 --> 23:25.695
<i>and waking up to him beating me</i>
<i>with a hose and biting me.</i>

23:26.530 --> 23:27.489
<i>Jim.</i>

23:28.448 --> 23:30.117
<i>He said his name was Jim.</i>

23:30.742 --> 23:32.494
The name didn't mean a damn thing.

23:32.994 --> 23:36.748
The prosecutor would say, "Do you see,
uh, the man who attacked you?"

23:36.832 --> 23:38.834
"Yes. There he is."

23:44.673 --> 23:48.844
And then the prosecutor
entered forensic evidence,

23:48.927 --> 23:52.180
such as the jewelry

23:52.264 --> 23:54.182
that was taken from victims

23:54.266 --> 23:56.059
and was in his possession,

23:56.601 --> 23:57.936
and the fingerprints.

24:00.313 --> 24:03.191
In the case
in the murder of Valerie Street,

24:03.275 --> 24:08.697
the perpetrator had left a print
on the ratchet of the handcuff.

24:08.780 --> 24:12.075
They never found a match for that print

24:12.159 --> 24:14.661
until, of course,
they arrested Richard Cottingham.

24:16.621 --> 24:20.959
Richard Cottingham actually took
the stand in his own defense.

24:22.127 --> 24:25.046
Richard Cottingham's defense was,
"I didn't do it."

24:27.924 --> 24:30.385
<i>Most of the stuff never happened that way.</i>

24:31.052 --> 24:35.515
<i>See, the police, they're the most</i>
<i>corrupt people in the world.</i>

24:35.599 --> 24:37.851
<i>They will plant evidence on you.</i>

24:37.934 --> 24:40.395
<i>They will hide evidence</i>
<i>that's in your favor.</i>

24:40.896 --> 24:42.230
 Later, he said,

24:42.314 --> 24:48.445
"You guys put my fingerprint
on that handcuff

24:48.528 --> 24:51.072
when you were cuffing my hands up
behind my back,

24:51.156 --> 24:53.617
and that's how you got that, uh, print."

24:54.743 --> 24:56.453
<i>When police found the room,</i>

24:56.536 --> 25:00.207
<i>they made it out to be</i>
<i>like they were mementos from victims.</i>

25:00.290 --> 25:02.375
He also said, "The jewelry that you found,

25:02.459 --> 25:05.670
you could buy on Canal Street.
It's a coincidence."

25:05.754 --> 25:07.964
He says he wasn't getting along
with his wife,

25:08.048 --> 25:09.883
so he frequented with ladies of the night.

25:10.717 --> 25:12.052
<i>I was a lousy husband.</i>

25:12.135 --> 25:13.762
<i>I was into that nightlife,</i>

25:13.845 --> 25:16.139
<i>and I went out with women every night.</i>

25:16.223 --> 25:18.975
He said they would like
some unusual kind of sex.

25:19.059 --> 25:21.645
That's what he enjoyed,
and that's what he was paying for.

25:22.604 --> 25:25.774
He said Leslie Ann O'Dell
permitted him to do the things

25:25.857 --> 25:26.942
that he did to her.

25:27.025 --> 25:29.694
<i>Look at her crime scene photos.</i>

25:30.529 --> 25:32.614
<i>You're not gonna see a beat-up person.</i>

25:32.697 --> 25:34.616
He said, well,
"She misunderstood his intentions."

25:34.699 --> 25:37.661
"She's supposed to take pain
because I paid her for a bondage session."

25:39.037 --> 25:43.041
In terms of the other women
who had identified him,

25:43.124 --> 25:45.126
he said the women were lying.

25:45.710 --> 25:47.963
<i>Hookers will say anything</i>
<i>to the police</i>

25:48.046 --> 25:49.839
<i>that the police want them to say.</i>

25:50.340 --> 25:53.718
<i>No hooker is gonna remember</i>
<i>a person two years before,</i>

25:53.802 --> 25:55.720
<i>but she'll come and say,</i>
<i>"Oh, that's the man,"</i>

25:55.804 --> 25:58.139
<i>'cause that's what the police</i>
<i>want them to say.</i>

25:58.848 --> 26:02.060
His defense
was that he was at work

26:02.686 --> 26:04.563
at the time of these, uh, crimes,

26:04.646 --> 26:07.107
and that he has time sheets.

26:07.190 --> 26:11.611
<i>I went to work every day. I ne--</i>
<i>I worked sometimes 200 days straight.</i>

26:11.695 --> 26:13.530
<i>I worked all kinds of overtime.</i>

26:14.155 --> 26:17.367
But it turned out
that some of his co-workers

26:17.450 --> 26:19.035
at Blue Cross Blue Shield

26:20.245 --> 26:22.789
were willing to come forward and testify.

26:24.374 --> 26:27.836
Other guys in the office
were afraid to testify against Richie

26:28.587 --> 26:30.755
because they were in fear

26:30.839 --> 26:33.592
that Richie might do something
to them or their family.

26:34.467 --> 26:36.511
But I wanted to hang him by his balls,

26:36.595 --> 26:40.640
and that… and that's the reason
that, uh, I… I wasn't afraid to testify.

26:40.724 --> 26:44.311
His alibi for a lot
of these murders was, "I was working."

26:45.228 --> 26:46.187
"I was working."

26:46.980 --> 26:49.024
And then I told the prosecutors,

26:49.107 --> 26:51.651
I said, "Look, I can tell you
why he wasn't there."

26:53.320 --> 26:54.779
He was cheating the clock,

26:54.863 --> 26:57.157
and I told them how he did it.

26:59.993 --> 27:05.624
Richard and I knew how to change
the internal clock on the computer.

27:06.207 --> 27:07.876
As soon as you start the job,

27:07.959 --> 27:10.045
you move the clock ten hours ahead,

27:10.128 --> 27:13.798
and when the job prints out on the log,

27:13.882 --> 27:15.550
it prints that time.

27:17.010 --> 27:19.763
So ten minutes was ten hours.

27:21.097 --> 27:24.893
I had no idea what he was doing
when he was cheating the clock.

27:24.976 --> 27:28.271
Murder would have been
the last thing on my… on the list.

27:28.938 --> 27:31.691
Nothing more I wanted to do
than to put this man away.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.402
I didn't care what happened to me.

27:37.405 --> 27:41.201
At this point, prosecution
had overwhelming evidence against him.

27:42.452 --> 27:46.373
The jury came back and, of course,
found him guilty of the several charges.

27:47.624 --> 27:50.627
I think people really feared

27:51.336 --> 27:53.254
to let him out.

27:53.338 --> 27:57.842
This guy was a menace, um,
that he had to be taken off the street,

27:57.926 --> 28:00.845
and I think the jury
were persuaded of that.

28:00.929 --> 28:05.642
When the jury returned a verdict,
Cottingham didn't, uh, cry out.

28:05.725 --> 28:07.894
He didn't, uh, show any emotion at all.

28:09.270 --> 28:12.232
His mother certainly did,
and his sister, oh yes.

28:12.899 --> 28:15.527
She was upset,
like I-- It was all my fault.

28:17.278 --> 28:18.321
After that trial,

28:19.447 --> 28:21.324
they brought up a homicide committed

28:21.408 --> 28:24.077
to a former neighbor
of his in Little Ferry,

28:24.661 --> 28:29.082
Maryann Carr,
who was not abducted from New York.

28:30.500 --> 28:33.086
Sure enough,
he was found guilty of killing her too.

28:34.671 --> 28:38.007
Richard Cottingham, he faces
another murder trial here in New York.

28:38.091 --> 28:40.969
That case involves
three prostitutes who were killed.

28:49.144 --> 28:51.104
During the New York trial,

28:52.772 --> 28:55.024
my mother's pimp, James Thomas,

28:55.608 --> 29:00.488
was waiting
for court to be in session again

29:01.489 --> 29:02.657
in the hallway.

29:04.951 --> 29:09.664
I guess Cottingham
was in the hallway at the same time.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.875
They get into a physical altercation

29:11.958 --> 29:17.589
where James is just pummeling Cottingham

29:17.672 --> 29:21.593
and punching him repeatedly saying,
"Let me punch him one more time."

29:32.228 --> 29:35.190
Richard was sentenced
to almost 200 years total

29:36.065 --> 29:37.275
in Trenton State.

29:40.403 --> 29:42.906
In 1984, I went down to Trenton

29:43.865 --> 29:46.409
to ask him to identify the Jane Doe

29:47.035 --> 29:49.746
from the Travel Inn homicide.

29:49.829 --> 29:53.124
It's very important to bring closure
to the families. They have nothing else.

29:53.208 --> 29:56.503
When I was there, he was real arrogant.

29:57.545 --> 30:00.590
And he had a kind of smirk on his face
like he was… he was playing with me.

30:01.925 --> 30:04.719
Bottom line, he wasn't giving anything up.

30:08.431 --> 30:12.602
Cottingham sat
in prison for 30 years.

30:13.686 --> 30:19.692
Not a letter, not a word,
not a single comment to anybody…

30:23.947 --> 30:25.490
until 2009.

30:59.774 --> 31:00.859
Hi.

31:01.359 --> 31:02.569
Hello.

31:02.652 --> 31:04.863
I'm Nadia Fezzani. I'm a journalist.

31:04.946 --> 31:08.700
I interview serial killers
to discover the deeper side of them,

31:08.783 --> 31:10.660
the psychological aspect.

31:10.743 --> 31:14.163
Richard Cottingham
had never confessed before.

31:14.747 --> 31:19.752
So when I asked him about the reason why
he had killed so many women,

31:19.836 --> 31:22.213
I was surprised that he actually told me.

31:23.840 --> 31:26.426
It was a game to me. It was…

31:27.218 --> 31:29.637
It was mainly psychological.

31:30.221 --> 31:31.139
Uh…

31:34.851 --> 31:40.690
I was able to get almost any woman
to do whatever I wanted them to do…

31:42.150 --> 31:43.568
psychologically.

31:43.651 --> 31:47.196
You know, or through the… the threat,
or the implied threat…

31:48.197 --> 31:49.157
uh…

31:50.033 --> 31:51.117
of being hurt,

31:51.784 --> 31:53.661
of being killed sometimes.

31:54.329 --> 31:57.040
It's godlike, almost.

31:57.540 --> 32:01.961
It's-- I mean, you're… you're
in complete control of somebody's destiny.

32:02.754 --> 32:05.214
Cottingham claims that

32:06.758 --> 32:10.803
one reason why he chose to kill
was when he believed

32:11.387 --> 32:15.224
that some of the women
would report him to the police.

32:15.808 --> 32:20.355
The murders were 99%
of the time just to protect myself.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.982
The Maryann Carr case,

32:23.775 --> 32:26.861
she wanted to leave, and I wouldn't
let her leave at some point.

32:27.362 --> 32:30.114
And then she said the fatal sentence,

32:30.198 --> 32:32.158
"I'll talk to the cops in the morning."

32:33.284 --> 32:36.663
Just that sentence. If she didn't
say that sentence, she'd be alive.

32:37.330 --> 32:40.625
But by her saying that,
I knew she had to die.

32:41.501 --> 32:43.461
Before I interviewed him,

32:43.544 --> 32:47.465
Richard Cottingham
had never confessed to the two murders

32:47.548 --> 32:51.594
he had committed
in the Travel Inn Lodge in Times Square.

32:52.303 --> 32:55.098
He revealed to Nadia

32:55.181 --> 32:57.850
that he knew Deedeh Goodarzi

32:57.934 --> 33:02.355
and that he had severed her head
and both her hands

33:02.438 --> 33:05.358
because he had been seen with her,

33:05.441 --> 33:08.069
and he was worried
that he would've been connected to her.

33:11.364 --> 33:15.159
He said that he left the hotel
at 3:30 in the morning,

33:16.536 --> 33:19.831
and he was just walking in Times Square.

33:21.374 --> 33:25.003
He was carrying the heads in a bag.

33:27.922 --> 33:32.218
And two police officers stopped him, said,
"Hey, where are you going this late?"

33:33.511 --> 33:36.431
He said,
"I'm just going to get something to eat."

33:37.557 --> 33:39.100
And they let him go,

33:40.601 --> 33:42.437
so he just continued walking.

33:45.481 --> 33:47.775
<i>I would keep pushing</i>
<i>the limit of the law,</i>

33:47.859 --> 33:51.612
<i>keep pushing what I could get away with.</i>

33:51.696 --> 33:54.449
<i>The more you get away,</i>
<i>the more you wanna get away with.</i>

33:55.742 --> 34:00.329
Cottingham claimed later
that he put them in the trunk of his car,

34:00.413 --> 34:03.666
then returned back to that hotel room…

34:05.835 --> 34:07.920
and then set the torsos on fire.

34:14.927 --> 34:17.555
<i>What was happening</i>
<i>was always gonna happen.</i>

34:18.598 --> 34:21.017
<i>That was the separate life I lived.</i>

34:23.227 --> 34:25.271
<i>Today, do you feel any remorse?</i>

34:26.564 --> 34:27.607
<i>Of course.</i>

34:28.107 --> 34:30.359
<i>If, uh, I had to do it over,</i>

34:30.443 --> 34:32.487
<i>probably none…</i>
<i>none of it would ever happen.</i>

34:32.570 --> 34:34.655
<i>I never thought I would get caught.</i>

34:36.115 --> 34:39.535
<i>We've been discussing</i>
<i>only basically the ones I was caught for.</i>

34:40.161 --> 34:42.413
<i>How many people</i>
<i>did you really kill?</i>

34:43.790 --> 34:48.461
<i> I mean, they talk about</i>
<i>there's no such thing as a perfect murder.</i>

34:49.253 --> 34:53.633
<i>Well, I had over 80 perfect murders</i>
<i>they never even knew about.</i>

34:56.719 --> 35:00.890
Cottingham said that he killed
more people than he was found guilty of.

35:03.059 --> 35:05.144
He said he was killing women

35:05.728 --> 35:08.981
every other week for 13 years.

35:10.525 --> 35:14.487
Altogether, that's 85 up to 100.

35:16.197 --> 35:19.117
<i>It was just</i>
<i>a constant type of thing.</i>

35:20.618 --> 35:23.496
While Mr. Cottingham's claims
seem outlandish,

35:23.579 --> 35:25.289
it's entirely possible.

35:26.040 --> 35:28.000
<i> I flew under the radar.</i>

35:28.084 --> 35:29.335
<i>Nobody knew.</i>

35:30.044 --> 35:33.131
I think Richard Cottingham
was gonna kill anywhere,

35:33.214 --> 35:35.967
but Times Square in the '70s did not help

35:36.759 --> 35:40.138
for someone like Richard,
who's a sexual sadist,

35:40.221 --> 35:44.559
to walk through and see sex workers
and peep shows

35:44.642 --> 35:49.438
and all sorts of dark,
erotic, sexual stuff.

35:50.231 --> 35:53.067
There was too much temptation.

35:53.151 --> 35:56.028
With every step,
the opportunity was there.

35:56.654 --> 35:59.323
It gave him
a kind of almost immunity.

35:59.407 --> 36:01.242
Everybody is doing this.

36:01.325 --> 36:04.662
Everybody is using everybody else.

36:04.745 --> 36:10.293
Everyone is degraded
in the sex industry part of Times Square.

36:14.297 --> 36:17.425
Pornography is not frowned upon,
you could say,

36:17.508 --> 36:19.594
like it was a few years ago.

36:20.094 --> 36:25.516
Today, it's, uh, it's looked upon,
um… you know, as perfectly normal.

36:26.100 --> 36:28.436
Pornography is considered
to be normal.

36:28.936 --> 36:32.064
I mean, there are judges
and lawyers and media figures in this town

36:32.148 --> 36:33.774
who thought <i>Deep Throat</i> was terrific.

36:33.858 --> 36:40.072
It was humiliating,
disgusting, sick, sadistic.

36:40.156 --> 36:43.618
Shut it down!
Shut it down!

36:43.701 --> 36:46.078
<i>Thousands of angry women</i>
<i>marched down Broadway</i>

36:46.162 --> 36:47.079
<i>to Times Square today.</i>

36:47.163 --> 36:49.624
<i>The heart</i>
<i>of the billion-dollar porn industry.</i>

36:49.707 --> 36:52.210
<i>They say</i>
<i>it promotes violence against women.</i>

36:52.293 --> 36:54.795
<i>They've made porn a feminist target.</i>

36:54.879 --> 36:57.715
In the late '70s,
Women Against Pornography

36:57.798 --> 37:02.720
was a campaign of reform
in trying to combat the rise of porn,

37:02.803 --> 37:04.889
not only in Times Square,
but throughout the country.

37:04.972 --> 37:09.602
What we're objecting to in pornography
is the use and abuse of women.

37:09.685 --> 37:12.021
It's the violent images of women.

37:12.104 --> 37:17.735
Uh, images of women being bound,
beaten, raped, tortured, and murdered

37:17.818 --> 37:20.488
for stimulation, entertainment, or profit.

37:21.072 --> 37:23.407
And so Women Against Pornography

37:23.491 --> 37:27.453
joined the ranks of people who wanted
to clean up Times Square and 42nd Street.

37:28.454 --> 37:30.581
The Midtown Enforcement Project,

37:30.665 --> 37:32.833
and the work that we did over the years,

37:32.917 --> 37:35.169
I think made a big difference.

37:35.253 --> 37:39.465
But what I think did more
to stop the sex business in Times Square

37:40.424 --> 37:41.425
was AIDS.

37:42.093 --> 37:45.471
For months now, we've been telling you
about the disease called A.I.D.S.,

37:45.554 --> 37:47.932
or Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome,

37:48.015 --> 37:51.143
and about half of all the cases
happened here in New York.

37:51.936 --> 37:57.984
The AIDS epidemic,
we became aware of it around 1981.

37:59.193 --> 38:03.489
It was, uh,
like a science-fiction scenario of death.

38:05.866 --> 38:10.162
There was a lot
of concern about the sex businesses

38:10.246 --> 38:12.331
and the sex workers in Times Square.

38:13.082 --> 38:15.251
The live sex acts stopped onstage.

38:15.334 --> 38:17.044
You didn't see that anymore,

38:17.128 --> 38:19.297
because that was just too… too dangerous.

38:22.091 --> 38:23.217
<i>In an overwhelming vote,</i>

38:23.301 --> 38:25.511
<i>members of the New York State</i>
<i>Public Health Council</i>

38:25.594 --> 38:27.346
<i>today gave local authorities the power</i>

38:27.430 --> 38:30.474
<i>to close</i>
<i>any establishment catering to the public</i>

38:30.558 --> 38:33.561
<i>that allows what it calls "dangerous sex."</i>

38:33.644 --> 38:36.063
<i>Places such as gay bathhouses,</i>
<i>adult bookstores,</i>

38:36.147 --> 38:37.857
<i>and heterosexual sex clubs.</i>

38:38.816 --> 38:40.443
On a Friday night at 11 p.m.,

38:40.526 --> 38:44.572
there are usually 50 heterosexual couples
inside Plato's Retreat,

38:44.655 --> 38:46.407
but tonight at 8:40,

38:46.490 --> 38:49.285
just 20 minutes before
their usual opening time,

38:49.368 --> 38:52.038
the city shut down this sexual playpen.

38:52.121 --> 38:55.166
So the sex businesses
and the sex workers on the street

38:55.249 --> 38:58.586
were getting kicked out,
and AIDS was pushing that along.

39:02.381 --> 39:05.885
A cleanup of Times Square has been one
of City Hall's promises over the years,

39:05.968 --> 39:08.971
and New Yorkers might be forgiven
some healthy skepticism by this time.

39:09.055 --> 39:11.557
But if you've taken a stroll
through the area lately,

39:11.640 --> 39:14.602
you might have known that, uh,
some real change has taken place there.

39:14.685 --> 39:17.855
<i>The number of peep shows,</i>
<i>massage parlors, and porno shops</i>

39:17.938 --> 39:20.358
<i>has been cut almost in half</i>
<i>in the past seven years.</i>

39:20.441 --> 39:23.319
<i>Crime in the Times Square area</i>
<i>is down too, the report said.</i>

39:26.989 --> 39:29.367
<i> We learned tonight</i>
<i>the Koch administration</i>

39:29.450 --> 39:32.995
<i>is considering a plan to turn the center</i>
<i>of the Times Square porno district</i>

39:33.079 --> 39:34.914
<i>into a kind of amusement park.</i>

39:36.999 --> 39:40.419
New development began in the early 1980s

39:40.503 --> 39:43.297
with major office towers,

39:43.381 --> 39:46.217
hotels, legitimate theaters.

39:46.300 --> 39:50.012
The city condemned
a very large swath of territory.

39:51.639 --> 39:55.559
But some historic theaters
on 42nd Street were preserved.

39:56.644 --> 39:58.854
The New Amsterdam Theater,

39:58.938 --> 40:01.399
where the<i> Ziegfeld Follies </i>opened in 1903,

40:01.482 --> 40:03.609
was going to be torn down.

40:05.027 --> 40:08.906
Somehow, between Disney
and the city of New York,

40:08.989 --> 40:10.533
for 30 or 40 million dollars,

40:10.616 --> 40:13.869
they were able to renovate that
into what it is today.

40:16.330 --> 40:19.291
The New Amsterdam
is where you first saw<i> The Lion King.</i>

40:20.459 --> 40:21.794
It's gorgeous.

40:22.628 --> 40:25.965
Times Square is now Disneyfied,

40:26.632 --> 40:29.593
so it has really had quite an evolution

40:30.219 --> 40:33.347
over the last 20, 30 years.

40:34.140 --> 40:35.975
Crime has come down so much,

40:37.393 --> 40:39.979
and tourism has exploded.

40:40.938 --> 40:46.277
I think something like 85% of people
who visit New York from elsewhere

40:46.360 --> 40:47.445
come to Times Square.

40:48.654 --> 40:52.366
Tourists love it,
but it sanitized the area.

40:52.950 --> 40:55.202
Times Square became
just like every other city.

40:56.412 --> 40:58.330
It's so generic.

41:00.124 --> 41:03.377
The old Times Square was extraordinary.

41:03.461 --> 41:04.837
There's nothing like it.

41:06.922 --> 41:09.550
And yet,
I understand why it's gone.

41:16.056 --> 41:17.683
The old Times Square

41:18.851 --> 41:20.978
was not a good place.

41:22.855 --> 41:26.734
It really ruined a lot of people's lives.

41:29.278 --> 41:34.325
I was out in the street
being trafficked… for 13 years.

41:35.868 --> 41:39.497
I've seen one study that said
the average lifespan of someone…

41:41.540 --> 41:44.376
that's experienced what I have
is seven years.

41:44.460 --> 41:46.045
I've never met anyone

41:46.128 --> 41:49.507
that was out
in the street of New York when I was

41:49.590 --> 41:51.383
that's alive today.

41:53.844 --> 41:54.803
I never have.

41:56.514 --> 41:58.933
So the whole time I was in New York City,

41:59.016 --> 42:02.102
I had no identification,
no Social Security number,

42:02.186 --> 42:05.272
uh, no birth certificate, nothing.
No identifying anything.

42:09.151 --> 42:12.988
If I died,
nobody would have ever known who I was.

42:13.072 --> 42:15.157
I just would have been a Jane Doe.

42:18.452 --> 42:21.497
In the 1970s
and into the 1980s,

42:21.580 --> 42:26.627
many sex workers' bodies
who have been found

42:26.710 --> 42:28.963
were listed as NHI,

42:29.880 --> 42:32.174
and that is "No Human Involved."

42:32.675 --> 42:37.596
In other words, they lacked
so little respect and status in society,

42:37.680 --> 42:39.014
according to the police,

42:39.098 --> 42:44.144
that it was not worth pursuing the crime
that had been committed against them.

42:46.438 --> 42:49.149
The police wouldn't go after
the perpetrator.

42:50.526 --> 42:51.944
I find it appalling.

42:54.947 --> 42:58.701
I think it's awful
when a killer kills someone

42:58.784 --> 43:00.953
and thinks they're gonna get away with it.

43:01.036 --> 43:05.666
And if there's up to a hundred women
and children that Richard killed,

43:06.417 --> 43:10.337
he was gonna go to the grave
with all these cold-case stories,

43:10.421 --> 43:13.340
and I just can't fathom that.

43:14.133 --> 43:16.969
So I wanted to learn more,

43:17.052 --> 43:20.973
and I knew I could only find out more
from Richard himself.

43:24.143 --> 43:26.729
That's how my relationship
started with him.

43:29.273 --> 43:31.066
We aren't friends.

43:32.860 --> 43:35.487
He is a real sick individual.

43:36.363 --> 43:40.409
And as I… began to visit him more,

43:41.368 --> 43:43.370
he revealed details

43:43.454 --> 43:47.166
about really traumatic experiences
with young girls.

43:48.292 --> 43:50.085
Deaths he's responsible for.

43:51.670 --> 43:57.134
It kind of snowballed
into working with police officers

43:57.217 --> 44:00.679
to help close some cold cases.

44:02.056 --> 44:06.518
Investigators have now started
multi-jurisdictional efforts

44:06.602 --> 44:10.439
looking into other cases
that this guy could be responsible for.

44:10.939 --> 44:12.816
But in 2010,

44:12.900 --> 44:16.070
Cottingham confessed
to the murder of Nancy Vogel.

44:16.737 --> 44:18.989
October in 1967,

44:19.073 --> 44:21.575
Nancy Vogel, a young mother,

44:21.659 --> 44:24.411
she went to go play bingo

44:24.495 --> 44:28.749
and disappeared in suburban New Jersey.

44:29.583 --> 44:33.545
Three days later, she's naked,
found dead in her car.

44:34.296 --> 44:36.840
She'd been strangled, sexually assaulted.

44:37.466 --> 44:39.885
Her clothes were neatly folded.

44:41.637 --> 44:43.639
He pled guilty to that

44:43.722 --> 44:47.226
and took another life sentence
on that case.

44:47.309 --> 44:50.104
<i>Mr. Cottingham,</i>
<i>you did commit the offenses</i>

44:50.187 --> 44:51.897
<i>you're pleading guilty to today?</i>

44:52.898 --> 44:53.982
<i>Yes.</i>

44:54.066 --> 44:56.360
Cottingham confessed
to other killings.

44:57.653 --> 44:59.947
Five murders in Bergen County

45:00.030 --> 45:03.617
that have been unsolved since 1968,

45:04.535 --> 45:06.036
1969,

45:07.371 --> 45:09.206
and 1974.

45:10.374 --> 45:13.585
They were schoolgirls
in their teenage years.

45:14.461 --> 45:19.508
It looks like he started out
with young women and girls

45:19.591 --> 45:23.053
in the suburbs, not far away from him,

45:23.137 --> 45:25.389
and that's how he started out.

45:26.390 --> 45:27.766
Maryann Carr,

45:28.267 --> 45:29.643
Nancy Vogel,

45:30.477 --> 45:32.604
and the schoolgirls,

45:32.688 --> 45:36.734
did not match his original profile

45:37.609 --> 45:40.028
because they weren't sex workers.

45:40.988 --> 45:43.741
Traditionally,
most serial killers,

45:43.824 --> 45:46.243
the first killings
are usually close to home.

45:47.494 --> 45:49.747
But when they see
the extent of the investigation

45:49.830 --> 45:51.915
and they realize
the possibility of being caught,

45:51.999 --> 45:53.667
they distance themselves.

45:54.877 --> 46:00.549
For him, it was a progression
to targeting prostitutes in Times Square.

46:02.718 --> 46:06.472
Serial killers
often tend to target

46:06.555 --> 46:09.641
those people that society devalues.

46:10.726 --> 46:16.482
And so sex workers, of course,
are… are universally devalued by society.

46:17.816 --> 46:20.861
Times Square aided
and abetted Richard Cottingham

46:20.944 --> 46:23.155
in the sense
that it gave him a victim pool.

46:26.700 --> 46:32.289
The problem that sex workers identify
as the most problematic

46:32.790 --> 46:35.209
is the illegality of their trade.

46:35.292 --> 46:38.712
That is why sex workers call
for decriminalization

46:38.796 --> 46:42.674
as a first step
towards creating regulations of…

46:42.758 --> 46:45.636
on their own terms, by themselves,

46:46.303 --> 46:49.389
in conditions that provide safety,

46:50.724 --> 46:52.392
paving the way eventually

46:52.476 --> 46:55.854
for the stigma
of being a sex worker to erode.

46:56.438 --> 46:58.982
The biggest takeaway from this case

46:59.066 --> 47:02.194
is maybe as many
as a hundred people were murdered,

47:02.277 --> 47:03.654
and we don't know about it.

47:07.366 --> 47:12.913
All of the women
that Richard killed…

47:14.915 --> 47:18.418
left this world in a horrific way.

47:19.419 --> 47:22.089
It always weighs heavily over me.

47:22.881 --> 47:24.007
A dark cloud.

47:24.925 --> 47:30.556
So I maintain a re… relationship
with Richard now

47:30.639 --> 47:34.017
because I want the names

47:34.101 --> 47:37.646
of the unidentified victims
whose lives he took.

47:40.357 --> 47:43.652
Lives that… never came to fruition.

47:44.486 --> 47:46.905
I think we need to remember them

47:46.989 --> 47:51.159
because they… deserve justice.
