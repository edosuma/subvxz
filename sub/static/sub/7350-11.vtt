WEBVTT

00:05.473 --> 00:08.376
* You gotta beg,
steal or borrow *

00:08.409 --> 00:10.478
* Ooh-ooh-ooh my

00:12.413 --> 00:14.715
* Hey, hey, hey, hey

00:14.748 --> 00:17.518
* Beg, steal or borrow

00:17.551 --> 00:19.720
* My love...

00:22.556 --> 00:25.059
*

00:25.093 --> 00:27.128
Oh, you are flagging,
Christopher.

00:27.161 --> 00:28.462
I'm trying to keep up with you.

00:28.496 --> 00:29.697
Don't bother.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.499
I used to go dancing
four nights a week

00:31.532 --> 00:35.136
before I suffered a radial
meniscal tear last year.

00:35.169 --> 00:36.637
Well, how'd
you do that?

00:36.670 --> 00:38.172
Dancing four nights a week.

00:39.707 --> 00:42.610
Oh, great!

00:42.643 --> 00:45.146
That was fabulous!

00:47.115 --> 00:50.318
Oh, who's next?
Pride...

00:51.652 --> 00:53.121
I learned a long time ago

00:53.154 --> 00:55.356
that my two feet
can't keep up

00:55.389 --> 00:56.857
with your two
feet, Loretta.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.126
I hear you.

00:58.159 --> 01:00.328
Young people! Join me.

01:00.361 --> 01:02.763
Oh, the kids
like EMD, so...

01:02.796 --> 01:04.298
It's EDM, sir.

01:04.332 --> 01:06.134
Whatever it's called,

01:06.167 --> 01:07.368
you can't convince me

01:07.401 --> 01:09.203
that a laptop's
a musical instrument.

01:09.237 --> 01:10.404
LASALLE: Agreed.
PRIDE: Right?

01:10.438 --> 01:12.173
WADE:
Sebastian...
Here's the thing.

01:12.206 --> 01:14.275
You see, I'm, uh...
I'm currently on a break

01:14.308 --> 01:15.543
from funk music,

01:15.576 --> 01:17.145
unless it's soul
funk, you know,

01:17.178 --> 01:18.312
like the Isley
Brothers or...

01:18.346 --> 01:19.147
Help, help,
somebody help me.

01:19.180 --> 01:21.615
Oh!
I'm undaunted.

01:21.649 --> 01:25.319
I will not quit until
I find a rear admiral

01:25.353 --> 01:26.620
willing to shake his

01:26.654 --> 01:29.657
rear admiral.
PRIDE:
Whoa, Loretta!

01:29.690 --> 01:31.392
Ms. Loretta dancing
with Navy brass?

01:31.425 --> 01:32.626
Not gonna miss that.

01:32.660 --> 01:34.162
I'm right
behind you.

01:34.195 --> 01:37.198
Maybe they'll play
"Between the Sheets."

01:37.231 --> 01:38.666
She looks great,
doesn't she?

01:39.700 --> 01:41.235
Spitting image of her mother.

01:41.269 --> 01:42.570
Want me to take this?

01:42.603 --> 01:43.804
I'll put it back
at the table.

01:43.837 --> 01:45.173
Thank you.

01:48.676 --> 01:51.812
Quite the Southern gentleman
you got there, Ms. Laurel.

01:51.845 --> 01:54.582
Thanks to you.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.217
I'm glad I gave him
a second ch...

02:21.409 --> 02:23.377
Come on. Come on.

02:23.411 --> 02:25.213
This way. It's okay.

02:25.246 --> 02:27.715
This way. It's okay.

02:27.748 --> 02:28.749
King!

02:31.919 --> 02:33.621
Laurel.

02:37.358 --> 02:39.793
PRIDE:
Laurel.

02:43.464 --> 02:44.698
Laurel?

02:44.732 --> 02:46.334
:
Oh, my God.

02:46.367 --> 02:47.401
Oh, my God.
Baby...

02:47.435 --> 02:48.569
He's really hurt.

02:48.602 --> 02:50.571
I-I don't know what...

02:50.604 --> 02:52.473
Daddy... Daddy, he's hurt.

02:52.506 --> 02:53.907
I don't, I don't
know where

02:53.941 --> 02:55.909
the blood is coming from.
It's okay. Let go.

02:55.943 --> 02:57.878
I... I c... I can't,
I don't know...
All right.

02:57.911 --> 02:59.647
I don't know what to do.
Laurel, listen to me.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.515
I don't...
I can't...
You gotta let go.

03:01.549 --> 03:03.351
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.353
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

03:05.386 --> 03:07.955
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

03:07.988 --> 03:10.558
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

03:10.591 --> 03:13.261
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

03:13.294 --> 03:14.362
* How, how, how, how

03:14.395 --> 03:16.730
* Hey, hey

03:22.570 --> 03:23.937
* You gotta come on.

03:25.406 --> 03:27.408
He's still in surgery,
but you should know--

03:27.441 --> 03:29.477
he suffered
a Class IV Hemorrhage.

03:29.510 --> 03:31.445
Lost 40% of
his blood volume.

03:31.479 --> 03:34.715
That said, we've managed to
control the external bleeding,

03:34.748 --> 03:37.285
but the contusions
sustained at the explosion

03:37.318 --> 03:39.753
have caused gross
internal hemorrhaging.

03:39.787 --> 03:41.389
But you're doing
everything in your power

03:41.422 --> 03:42.423
to stabilize him, right?

03:42.456 --> 03:43.757
Yes, we are.

03:43.791 --> 03:45.359
And Orion seems like a fighter.

03:45.393 --> 03:46.494
Mm-hmm.

03:46.527 --> 03:48.296
We'll keep you both posted.

03:48.329 --> 03:50.364
Thank you, Doctor.

03:50.398 --> 03:53.401
Dad, just... just tell me
that he's not gonna die.

03:55.303 --> 03:58.038
He's not going to die.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.440
I wish, just
this once,

03:59.473 --> 04:01.342
you were a
better liar.

04:03.511 --> 04:04.778
You called Orion's family yet?

04:05.513 --> 04:08.349
Go do that.

04:23.497 --> 04:25.366
Thanks for running back
to the morgue to get my kit.

04:25.399 --> 04:26.767
How's everyone
holding up?

04:26.800 --> 04:28.336
I think we're all feeling
badly shaken, but

04:28.369 --> 04:30.704
very lucky.

04:33.006 --> 04:34.875
Where would you like to start?

04:38.078 --> 04:40.881
I guess this is where
Pride would say,

04:40.914 --> 04:43.551
"Let's review
what we got so far."
Yeah.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.386
The victims are
Herbert Walker

04:45.419 --> 04:47.287
and Allison
Lacroix.

04:49.056 --> 04:52.960
Mr. Walker appears to have
had his anterior jugular

04:52.993 --> 04:55.696
severed by a piece
of flying shrapnel.

04:57.465 --> 05:00.568
Ms. Lacroix has multiple
lacerations, center mass.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.438
Walker worked in the
office of city planning.

05:04.472 --> 05:05.639
Lacroix was the civilian wife

05:05.673 --> 05:07.775
of Naval Captain
Patrick Lacroix.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.810
I got witnesses
that put both of them

05:09.843 --> 05:12.513
in the same general area as
Orion when the blast occurred.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.382
Based on the site map,
that's somewhere

05:14.415 --> 05:17.418
in the vicinity
of tables 14, 15 or 17.

05:17.451 --> 05:18.986
Now, table 14 was sponsored by

05:19.019 --> 05:21.489
the New Orleans Office
of Homeland Security.

05:21.522 --> 05:24.492
Table 15 was Fender and Cohen,
defense attorneys,

05:24.525 --> 05:26.827
and table 17,
group of naval commanders.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.929
LASALLE:
What we need...
BRODY:
Nature and

05:28.962 --> 05:30.431
precise location of the bomb.

05:30.464 --> 05:32.766
Tons of cameras.
I'll get the footage.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.668
At autopsy,
I'll likely be able

05:34.702 --> 05:36.537
to pull
chemical traces

05:36.570 --> 05:38.572
off of the
shrapnel.
See this?

05:38.606 --> 05:40.007
I'm guessing this is part
of the detonation device.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.409
If you get me
more of these,

05:41.442 --> 05:42.610
I might be able
to reconstruct it.

05:42.643 --> 05:44.011
And as for suspects,

05:44.044 --> 05:46.013
we all had to go through
security to get in here.

05:46.046 --> 05:48.516
Bomber had to bypass it
to get that device in.

05:48.549 --> 05:49.783
Maybe event staff?

05:49.817 --> 05:51.485
Caterers, florists...

05:51.519 --> 05:52.853
I'll get a list of
everyone who worked the party.

05:52.886 --> 05:55.523
All right.

05:55.556 --> 05:56.790
Let's go learn things.

05:59.593 --> 06:00.928
PATTON:
I've been on the Web,

06:00.961 --> 06:02.162
monitoring all this
chatter-chatter,

06:02.195 --> 06:03.564
and this sound
of silence

06:03.597 --> 06:04.898
is giving me
a migraine.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.700
Nobody in the
terrorist crowd

06:06.734 --> 06:09.002
want to take the credit
for making things go boom.

06:09.036 --> 06:11.171
Look, I appreciate you
rushing down here, Patton, but

06:11.204 --> 06:13.507
there's no indication there's
a Web angle in this case.

06:13.541 --> 06:15.443
Like I care.
I'm either here helping,

06:15.476 --> 06:18.746
or I'm at home trying to hack
some free crap out of QVC.

06:18.779 --> 06:20.113
Excuse me.

06:20.147 --> 06:22.850
Hypothetically speaking.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.718
Come on, Brody.

06:24.752 --> 06:27.721
Let me go all deep Web on
whoever these crazy asses are.

06:27.755 --> 06:30.924
Okay. Of the 62 members

06:30.958 --> 06:33.627
of the staff, only
56 have gone through

06:33.661 --> 06:35.629
a pat-down and search.
Of the six that didn't,

06:35.663 --> 06:39.500
only one is still unaccounted
for after the blast-- a waiter.

06:39.533 --> 06:40.734
Okay, hit me with a name.

06:40.768 --> 06:42.202
Bertrand Willis.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.872
Okay.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.107
Bertrand Willis.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.976
What database are you
running his name through?

06:49.009 --> 06:50.944
I created a way

06:50.978 --> 06:52.613
to consolidate
municipal, federal,

06:52.646 --> 06:54.482
state and even international
criminal databases.

06:54.515 --> 06:57.651
Do I want to know
how you do this?

06:57.685 --> 07:00.754
You most certainly do not.

07:01.989 --> 07:05.493
Whatever you're doing,
put it on hold.

07:05.526 --> 07:08.161
Girlfriend of the band
was recording their set--

07:08.195 --> 07:11.064
caught the exact blast site.
Where was it?

07:11.098 --> 07:13.601
LASALLE:
We had Patton digitize
the footage.

07:13.634 --> 07:17.204
Angle catches the tables closest
to where the bomb went off.

07:17.237 --> 07:19.540
PRIDE:
Well, what am I supposed
to be looking at?

07:19.573 --> 07:21.742
Time code was 7:12 p.m.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.544
That Orion?

07:24.712 --> 07:26.246
We were slightly off

07:26.279 --> 07:28.549
in our original guess
of where the bomb was.

07:28.582 --> 07:32.620
Table 19, seat eight.

07:32.653 --> 07:34.922
We were at table 19.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.690
And you were seat eight.

07:47.635 --> 07:50.671
Bertrand Willis-- that's the
name of the missing waiter?

07:50.704 --> 07:52.039
Yeah. Sound familiar?

07:52.072 --> 07:53.607
Doesn't
ring a bell.

07:53.641 --> 07:55.175
We searched
our NCIS files.

07:55.208 --> 07:56.944
He didn't show up
in any of our cases.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.179
Does have civilian priors--
drunk and disorderly,

07:59.212 --> 08:00.848
domestic disturbance.

08:00.881 --> 08:02.583
Patton. Yeah?

08:02.616 --> 08:05.218
King, I'm gonna set up
a security detail for you.

08:05.252 --> 08:07.087
Look, somebody tried
to kill you once.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.255
They might try it again.

08:08.288 --> 08:10.257
Set up something
here for Laurel.

08:10.290 --> 08:11.959
But I'm not
giving whoever

08:11.992 --> 08:14.528
the satisfaction
of me running scared.

08:14.562 --> 08:15.696
BRODY:
Thanks, Patton.

08:15.729 --> 08:18.131
Got him.
Bertrand Willis has a day job

08:18.165 --> 08:20.200
at a mechanics shop
in Chef Menteur.

08:20.233 --> 08:22.536
We'll call you
when we got him cuffed.

08:22.570 --> 08:24.638
SEBASTIAN:
I'm thinking about the bomb
and its parts.

08:24.672 --> 08:26.173
Detonator,
accelerant.

08:26.206 --> 08:27.908
Shrapnel.

08:27.941 --> 08:30.911
Pretty sure this baby came
from the detonation device.

08:30.944 --> 08:33.313
Cell phone?
It's my best guess,

08:33.346 --> 08:35.315
but I've got barely anything
to work with here.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.585
Where the hell's
the rest of you, huh?!

08:37.618 --> 08:40.788
Sebastian, yelling at the
evidence is rarely effective.

08:40.821 --> 08:43.156
Sorry. I was punch-drunk.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.292
Aren't we all?
As for the accelerant,

08:45.325 --> 08:47.194
I tested those metal pieces
you gave me.

08:47.227 --> 08:49.897
Lawn fertilizer and diesel fuel.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.198
It's a crude concoction

08:51.231 --> 08:53.667
I've dubbed
"Big Joe's Garage Cocktail."

08:53.701 --> 08:55.335
Meaning any average Joe

08:55.368 --> 08:57.671
with a love of lawn care
and muscle cars could make one.

08:57.705 --> 08:59.172
Yeah, and there's shrapnel.

08:59.206 --> 09:02.576
Now, I've pulled a series
of small metal shards,

09:02.610 --> 09:04.878
likely from the casing.

09:04.912 --> 09:08.181
I'm thinking
a deep fryer.

09:08.215 --> 09:12.552
And then... there are these.

09:13.386 --> 09:16.023
Come to Papa.

09:20.628 --> 09:22.930
Heavy grease residue,

09:22.963 --> 09:24.598
spherical
chrome steel composition.

09:24.632 --> 09:26.299
Ball bearings.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.335
Okay, detonator unknown.

09:28.368 --> 09:30.871
Accelerant crude.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.773
Shrapnel identified.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.174
We've framed
a picture.

09:34.207 --> 09:36.610
Let's find who painted it.

09:44.752 --> 09:46.253
Bertrand Willis.
Yello.

09:46.286 --> 09:47.788
Agents Lasalle
and Brody.

09:47.821 --> 09:50.223
What can I do for you?

09:50.257 --> 09:53.260
You can turn your ass around
and hope you got thin wrists.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.395
What the hell?!
What's this about?

09:55.428 --> 09:57.264
It's about the catering gig
you did the other night.

09:57.297 --> 09:59.633
Navy and Marine Relief
Gala at City Park.

09:59.667 --> 10:00.868
It's where the
bomb went off.

10:00.901 --> 10:01.869
Where you disappeared.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.403
Oh, hell, this will never end.

10:03.436 --> 10:06.306
Look, six weeks ago,
my wallet was stolen.

10:06.339 --> 10:08.976
Credit cards.
Someone started charging me up

10:09.009 --> 10:10.744
to the tune
of thousands of dollars.

10:10.778 --> 10:11.945
Any proof of this story?

10:11.979 --> 10:13.647
Sure. Call my
credit card company.

10:13.681 --> 10:15.949
I was on the phone
with them for hours.

10:15.983 --> 10:18.151
Look, I never catered
in my life.

10:18.185 --> 10:21.054
And as for City Park,
I don't much care for crowds,

10:21.088 --> 10:23.657
and I like grass even less.

10:23.691 --> 10:25.058
Credit card
companies confirm

10:25.092 --> 10:26.894
the story
Bertrand Willis told us.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.896
I got two witnesses that
put him at Cooter Brown's

10:28.929 --> 10:30.263
the whole time the
gala was going on.

10:30.297 --> 10:33.066
Double-P bringing
the intel.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.068
Note-- there's always
a hackers angle.

10:35.102 --> 10:37.070
Beyond the stuff
in his wallet,

10:37.104 --> 10:39.907
Bertrand's driver's license
and his SSN were compromised.

10:39.940 --> 10:42.309
Which is how our bomber was able
to fill out an I-9,

10:42.342 --> 10:45.412
pass a background check
and get access to the event.

10:45.445 --> 10:48.415
So, it could be anyone from any
case Pride has ever had at NCIS.

10:50.050 --> 10:52.352
Connection predates
my days at NCIS.

10:56.323 --> 10:57.891
Hey, how's
the kid doing?

10:57.925 --> 10:59.059
He's out of surgery.

10:59.092 --> 11:00.293
He's critical but stable.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.929
His family's flying in.

11:04.464 --> 11:06.433
So, Loretta sent me info
on the bomb.

11:06.466 --> 11:08.869
There is a signature.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.938
It's the Broussard
Syndicate.

11:10.971 --> 11:11.939
The Broussards?

11:11.972 --> 11:13.406
But they're defunct.

11:13.440 --> 11:17.177
'Cause I shut their asses down
two decades ago.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.012
Quick bit
of New Orleans history.

11:19.046 --> 11:22.716
In the early '80s, the biggest
Mob element in the city--

11:22.750 --> 11:25.218
guy named
Carlos Marcello.

11:25.252 --> 11:27.721
He was put away
on federal racketeering charges.

11:27.755 --> 11:29.222
Suddenly there's
a vacuum

11:29.256 --> 11:31.091
as to who would control
the deep and dark

11:31.124 --> 11:32.726
that came in and out
of the city.

11:32.760 --> 11:36.263
Broussard Syndicate moved in,
filled that void.

11:36.296 --> 11:40.267
Fiercely territorial, unafraid
to flex their muscles.

11:40.300 --> 11:44.271
Dominated drugs,
weapons, counterfeiting.

11:44.304 --> 11:46.106
PATTON:
Those some bad dudes.

11:46.139 --> 11:48.408
My last assignment with
the sheriff's office--

11:48.441 --> 11:50.443
roll up the
Broussards.

11:50.477 --> 11:54.147
First day of trial, bomb went
off outside my JPSO district.

11:54.181 --> 11:56.449
Fertilizer and diesel
fuel, ball bearings...

11:56.483 --> 11:57.885
Packed
in a deep fryer.

11:57.918 --> 11:59.887
Intention was to intimidate me.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.922
Had the exact opposite effect.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.826
All of the adults
in this picture are

12:05.859 --> 12:07.294
incarcerated or dead.

12:07.327 --> 12:11.298
Which means
the torch has been passed

12:11.331 --> 12:12.966
to the new generation.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.167
Sasha.

12:14.201 --> 12:15.903
Ashley.

12:15.936 --> 12:16.904
Michael.

12:16.937 --> 12:17.905
Dante.

12:17.938 --> 12:18.906
Frank.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.507
I'm telling you,

12:20.540 --> 12:24.511
one of them is behind
what happened.

12:24.544 --> 12:27.915
Everything you need
to know...

12:27.948 --> 12:29.182
is in here.

12:32.519 --> 12:35.155
King, where you going?

12:35.188 --> 12:37.190
To see an old friend.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.347
Deputy Pride.

13:00.380 --> 13:03.350
Haven't been "deputy"
for a long time.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.285
Let's talk, "Baitfish."

13:05.318 --> 13:08.455
Haven't been "Baitfish"
in a long time, either.

13:08.488 --> 13:10.090
Take a break.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.025
I'm in the
middle of a rush.

13:12.059 --> 13:14.828
All orders are on hold
until further notice!

13:14.862 --> 13:16.463
The rush is

13:16.496 --> 13:18.331
now over.
Just 'cause I'm an ex-con

13:18.365 --> 13:20.100
doesn't give you the
right to push me around.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.002
I'm rehabilitated.

13:22.035 --> 13:24.004
I don't drink or drug
no more like before.

13:24.037 --> 13:26.006
For real. Look.

13:26.039 --> 13:27.975
Clean and sober.

13:28.008 --> 13:30.377
I'm thrilled for you.
Bomb at City Park.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.479
Got your old bosses
written all over it.

13:32.512 --> 13:33.847
I don't know anything.

13:33.881 --> 13:35.215
Yes, you do.
I don't.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.449
I swear. On my word.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.518
That supposed
to mean something to me?

13:38.551 --> 13:40.020
Come here.

13:40.053 --> 13:41.454
Sasha,

13:41.488 --> 13:42.589
Ashley, Michael, Dante, Frank.

13:42.622 --> 13:44.024
Which one is it?

13:44.057 --> 13:45.959
I told you
I don't know.

13:45.993 --> 13:47.995
I put you away once.

13:48.028 --> 13:50.530
I'll bet my last dollar
if I look, just a little,

13:50.563 --> 13:52.432
I'll find a reason
to send you back.

13:53.934 --> 13:55.268
Now, which one?

13:55.302 --> 13:58.605
Sasha, Ashley, Michael,
Dante, Frank.

14:10.617 --> 14:13.553
Dante called me about a
month ago asking for help

14:13.586 --> 14:16.156
getting a false identity.
I assumed he wanted to give it

14:16.189 --> 14:18.091
to a mule to move contraband.

14:18.125 --> 14:20.627
The number he called you from,
write it down.

14:20.660 --> 14:22.963
He's got, like, a dozen phones,
rotates 'em around.

14:22.996 --> 14:24.331
He's not an idiot.

14:24.364 --> 14:27.634
That point's debatable.
Write it down.

14:32.039 --> 14:35.008
You'll protect
me, right?

14:35.042 --> 14:37.010
That privilege? Long gone.

14:37.044 --> 14:38.912
I get it, but you
don't understand.

14:38.946 --> 14:42.015
If this gets back to him,
Dante will kill me.

14:42.049 --> 14:44.617
Then you better hope
I find him first.

14:44.651 --> 14:47.487
You hear from Dante,
I'm your first call.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.589
This isn't just about drugs
or the bombing.

14:49.622 --> 14:52.092
He's trying to make
alliances with gangs,

14:52.125 --> 14:54.261
branch out into weapons.

14:54.294 --> 14:58.565
Dante, he wants to put
the Syndicate back together.

14:58.598 --> 14:59.933
Not gonna happen.

14:59.967 --> 15:02.402
Not in my city.

15:11.178 --> 15:12.345
Dante Broussard.

15:12.379 --> 15:13.346
In and out of Rayburn

15:13.380 --> 15:14.447
over the last five years.

15:14.481 --> 15:16.449
Petty things.

15:16.483 --> 15:18.618
Burglary,
assault.

15:18.651 --> 15:21.388
But in the last six months,
my old friends at JPSO confirm

15:21.421 --> 15:23.323
he's trying to move white.

15:23.356 --> 15:24.557
Confirm from who?

15:26.693 --> 15:28.395
That friend you went to see?

15:28.428 --> 15:31.598
Guy predates you. Not important.

15:31.631 --> 15:35.168
Okay, but, like always,

15:35.202 --> 15:37.470
the more I know,
the more I can help.

15:37.504 --> 15:39.306
BRODY:
BOLO's out on Dante.
Nothing so far.

15:39.339 --> 15:41.308
Patton's working the cell number
you gave him,

15:41.341 --> 15:42.342
but likely it's...

15:42.375 --> 15:44.311
Burner?
Yeah.

15:44.344 --> 15:45.545
We need
to start putting pressure

15:45.578 --> 15:47.414
on the other Broussard kids.

15:47.447 --> 15:48.715
Ashley Broussard is dead.

15:48.748 --> 15:50.717
Boating accident in 2011.

15:50.750 --> 15:53.320
Michael, he's in prison in Laos.

15:53.353 --> 15:55.255
Laos?
Porn thing.

15:55.288 --> 15:58.091
I saw photos, which I'm gonna
need a quart of brain bleach

15:58.125 --> 15:59.459
to cleanse from my memory.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.495
What about Frank and Sasha?

16:02.529 --> 16:03.563
Following in the footsteps
of the others,

16:03.596 --> 16:05.498
Frank's
also fresh out

16:05.532 --> 16:08.501
of prison after 15 months
on a car theft rap.

16:08.535 --> 16:10.570
We've got a lead
on his last place of residence.

16:10.603 --> 16:12.305
LASALLE:
And a work address,

16:12.339 --> 16:13.706
warehouse in Harahan.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.542
And Sasha?

16:15.575 --> 16:17.544
WOMAN: Sasha's saving
you the trouble

16:17.577 --> 16:20.080
of having to darken
her doorstep.

16:20.113 --> 16:22.149
I'd say

16:22.182 --> 16:23.783
it's lovely to see you again,
Dwayne,

16:23.816 --> 16:27.654
but, given the circumstances,
I doubt you'd agree.

16:30.057 --> 16:34.527
My family,

16:34.561 --> 16:36.629
they've been ruining my life
since I was in utero.

16:38.298 --> 16:39.732
And...

16:39.766 --> 16:42.335
growing up
a mobster's daughter is...

16:42.369 --> 16:45.138
not as cool as advertised
in the brochure.

16:45.172 --> 16:46.573
How do I find Dante?

16:46.606 --> 16:48.575
I don't know.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.510
I'm sorry.

16:50.543 --> 16:52.579
You got to understand,

16:52.612 --> 16:54.714
I keep my distance.
But when I heard

16:54.747 --> 16:56.583
about the bombing

16:56.616 --> 16:59.552
and I realized your connection
to one of the victims,

16:59.586 --> 17:01.354
then I thought

17:01.388 --> 17:03.223
that I should come over
as soon as possible.

17:03.256 --> 17:04.424
He's...

17:04.457 --> 17:06.093
your daughter's boyfriend?

17:06.126 --> 17:07.594
Names.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.429
Cell numbers. Addresses.

17:09.462 --> 17:11.531
Doesn't matter
how far back.

17:11.564 --> 17:14.567
Anything that might lead
to your brother's capture.

17:14.601 --> 17:16.269
If this

17:16.303 --> 17:18.705
is really him...

17:18.738 --> 17:20.807
then it doesn't surprise me.

17:23.176 --> 17:24.611
After my father went to prison,

17:24.644 --> 17:28.315
he was... obsessed.

17:28.348 --> 17:29.549
Said you ruined us.

17:32.619 --> 17:35.622
Said that he would make good

17:35.655 --> 17:37.624
on what our father couldn't.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.092
By killing me?

17:39.126 --> 17:42.395
By making you... back down.

17:42.429 --> 17:44.264
I have
spent every

17:44.297 --> 17:46.466
waking moment trying to change

17:46.499 --> 17:49.402
people's association
with my last name.

17:49.436 --> 17:50.703
I'm aware of your charity work.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.505
And yet you've never accepted
my offer

17:52.539 --> 17:54.507
to be on any of the boards.

17:54.541 --> 17:55.842
Tad awkward.

17:58.378 --> 18:01.381
Can't blame a
girl for trying.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.219
It's ironic

18:06.253 --> 18:08.221
how our worlds
are intertwined.

18:08.255 --> 18:11.624
Your legacy is the
albatross around my neck,

18:11.658 --> 18:13.693
and our fathers...

18:15.562 --> 18:19.098
Same cell block
for a few months, right?

18:20.533 --> 18:23.102
If we need anything more,
we'll be in touch.

18:37.684 --> 18:39.886
Frank Broussard?

18:39.919 --> 18:41.554
Who wants to know?

18:41.588 --> 18:43.690
NCIS.

18:43.723 --> 18:45.692
We're gonna ask you questions
about the City Park bombing.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.560
Where's your cousin
Dante?

18:47.594 --> 18:49.829
Don't know. Don't give a crap.

18:49.862 --> 18:52.265
Even if I did,
wouldn't tell you.

18:52.299 --> 18:54.567
Well, tell us this,
where were you last night?

18:54.601 --> 18:56.203
Last night?

18:56.236 --> 18:58.605
Go ask at Jackfish
Jordy's Grill.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.573
It's Wing-it-Wednesday
from 5:00 to close.

19:00.607 --> 19:02.509
Where's Jackfish Jordy's
located?

19:02.542 --> 19:03.410
Google it, bitch.

19:03.443 --> 19:07.747
Now, that was the wrong answer.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.322
Y'all don't have
probable cause.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.690
You can't just break
into my stuff.

19:17.724 --> 19:20.627
You had your chance
to play nice.

19:20.660 --> 19:23.330
This is what happens
when we use the B-word.

19:23.363 --> 19:26.499
LASALLE:
Looks like a false bottom.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.737
That was already there
when I got this job.

19:37.744 --> 19:39.746
Looks like old Frank's
got a...

19:39.779 --> 19:41.414
raging case of the herps.

19:41.448 --> 19:43.983
What can I say?
The ladies love cool Frank.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.752
Doubtful.

19:47.887 --> 19:51.258
Using it as a cutting agent
for Dante's coke, ain't you?

19:51.291 --> 19:52.725
Black market for Benzocaine

19:52.759 --> 19:55.895
sometimes fetches
as much as cocaine itself.

19:55.928 --> 19:57.797
Whether you're mixing
or selling,

19:57.830 --> 20:00.667
I'm sure your parole officer

20:00.700 --> 20:02.235
will be intrigued.

20:02.269 --> 20:04.671
Your cousin Dante.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.673
Help us bring him in,

20:06.706 --> 20:09.809
I'm gonna let you slide
on the Benzocaine.

20:09.842 --> 20:12.879
We haven't been meeting
directly lately.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.647
As a precaution.

20:14.681 --> 20:17.250
If I call him,
he'll know something's up.

20:17.284 --> 20:18.651
He told me to contact
him once I've lined up

20:18.685 --> 20:19.886
and vetted a
major buyer.

20:19.919 --> 20:20.920
We'll make one up.

20:20.953 --> 20:22.522
No.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.991
No, a real buyer.
Someone on the grid.

20:25.024 --> 20:27.827
Dante won't show unless he's
sure of who he's dealing with.

20:29.429 --> 20:32.265
I got a buyer who's on the grid.

20:32.299 --> 20:34.667
No. No. Hell no, man.

20:34.701 --> 20:36.002
It's not a request.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.770
You're gonna make a buy,

20:37.804 --> 20:39.038
help me draw this guy out.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.573
Cocaine's that hard stuff, man.

20:40.607 --> 20:42.041
Even playing with that's
dangerous.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.676
He's been blowing people up.

20:43.710 --> 20:45.812
Making my point for me.

20:45.845 --> 20:47.780
It's people I care about.

20:48.681 --> 20:51.684
Copy that.

20:51.718 --> 20:53.353
What's in it for me?

20:53.386 --> 20:55.922
Well, you get to keep
your safety net-- me.

20:55.955 --> 20:57.824
So, unless you want to revisit

20:57.857 --> 20:59.792
those weapon charges...

21:01.728 --> 21:03.663
At this point, man,

21:03.696 --> 21:06.699
I deserve some frequent-flier
miles or something, man.

21:08.067 --> 21:09.936
FRANK:
This guy legit?

21:09.969 --> 21:12.372
'Cause like I said,
if this is just some cop

21:12.405 --> 21:14.040
dressed up to look
like a hood...

21:14.073 --> 21:16.843
I don't know which I should
get more offended by--

21:16.876 --> 21:18.811
the "cop" part or
the "hood" part.

21:18.845 --> 21:20.947
Pipe down, both of you.

21:20.980 --> 21:23.850
Hey, how come I don't get a vest
just in case this get ugly?

21:23.883 --> 21:26.486
Yeah, that'd be comforting.
And a dead giveaway.

21:26.519 --> 21:28.521
What? They don't make vests
that look like regular clothes?

21:28.555 --> 21:30.523
What, y'all ain't got
the technology for that?

21:30.557 --> 21:31.958
In prison, we made armor
out of book covers

21:31.991 --> 21:33.660
so people couldn't shank us.

21:33.693 --> 21:35.962
See? Prisoners get more
protection than us.

21:35.995 --> 21:38.331
That's informants abuse, man.

21:38.365 --> 21:41.734
Well, you can file a grievance
with the CI union later.

21:41.768 --> 21:43.002
All right, shut up.

21:43.035 --> 21:44.604
Look alive.

21:49.942 --> 21:51.811
Where's Dante?

21:51.844 --> 21:52.779
Don't know.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.614
He must've sent his minions.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.649
I smell a setup.

21:56.683 --> 21:57.817
Wouldn't make much sense.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.952
I set you up,
I'm back in prison.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.622
All right, new plan.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.591
After they show the merch,
we pop them

22:04.624 --> 22:07.627
and then get them
to roll over on Dante.

22:13.099 --> 22:14.767
Yo.

22:14.801 --> 22:16.769
Where's Dante?

22:16.803 --> 22:19.338
He regretfully couldn't attend,
but he sends his regards.

22:20.573 --> 22:21.741
Pure Colombian.

22:21.774 --> 22:23.910
Uncut, free-trade, organic.

22:23.943 --> 22:27.146
Looks like y'all are
Real Deal Holyfield, huh?

22:27.179 --> 22:28.815
And you're under arrest...
Hands behind your back!

22:28.848 --> 22:30.650
DEA!
What?

22:30.683 --> 22:32.084
Hands behind your back.
Hold up, man. What you...

22:32.118 --> 22:33.386
Frank!

22:33.420 --> 22:34.721
This is a sting!

22:34.754 --> 22:36.723
Lasalle, what's going on, man?

22:36.756 --> 22:39.526
No, this is a sting. Frank!

22:41.528 --> 22:43.830
NCIS.

22:43.863 --> 22:44.964
My bust...

22:44.997 --> 22:46.666
went bust.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.901
While we were running
a sting on Dante,

22:48.935 --> 22:52.071
DEA was running one
on my guy Ross P.

22:52.104 --> 22:54.073
Apparently he'd been selling
ecstasy and they thought

22:54.106 --> 22:56.075
he was looking to move
into selling coke.

22:56.108 --> 22:57.777
Did you know about the ecstasy?

22:57.810 --> 22:59.078
News to me.

22:59.111 --> 23:01.614
Now Ross P. is downtown
and Frank Broussard

23:01.648 --> 23:03.416
is gone and gone.

23:03.450 --> 23:06.118
And my guess is if
Dante was thinking about

23:06.152 --> 23:09.656
showing up for the buy
at all, he's spooked.

23:09.689 --> 23:12.091
All right, put
a BOLO out on Frank,

23:12.124 --> 23:15.928
see if someone can make up
for DEA crashing your party.

23:18.164 --> 23:19.198
Should I ask?

23:19.231 --> 23:21.067
If you wave at it,

23:21.100 --> 23:22.969
it waves back.

23:24.937 --> 23:28.975
Brody and I brought it for,
uh, Patton's kid.

23:29.008 --> 23:31.143
Pride.

23:31.177 --> 23:33.045
SASHA:
Uh, I'm sorry.

23:33.079 --> 23:35.615
I didn't know
who else to come to.

23:35.648 --> 23:37.083
What is it?

23:37.116 --> 23:40.653
Paul Jenks. He showed up
at the charity offices.

23:40.687 --> 23:42.455
Threatened me.
Said if Dante

23:42.489 --> 23:45.091
goes after him,
he's coming after me.

23:45.124 --> 23:46.526
Who's Paul Jenks?

23:47.727 --> 23:48.928
I got this.

23:51.631 --> 23:53.132
You threatening people,
Baitfish?

23:53.165 --> 23:55.134
You said you wouldn't
protect me, so

23:55.167 --> 23:57.504
got to watch my own back.

23:57.537 --> 23:59.739
After Dante showed up, hell
yeah, I had to do something.

23:59.772 --> 24:02.074
Wait, wait, wait. Dante showed
up and you didn't call me?

24:02.108 --> 24:03.776
What the hell you want me to do?

24:03.810 --> 24:04.911
They think I'm helping anyone,

24:04.944 --> 24:06.012
let alone you, they'll cap me.

24:06.045 --> 24:09.516
Now, wh... when exactly
did he show up

24:09.549 --> 24:11.618
and what exactly did he say?

24:11.651 --> 24:14.887
Dante wanted to know
if I could get to you.

24:14.921 --> 24:16.889
Said he's planning...

24:16.923 --> 24:19.258
What Planning what?

24:19.291 --> 24:20.627
Oh, God.

24:20.660 --> 24:22.862
I... I-I got to get out...

24:24.564 --> 24:26.899
Paul! Damn it!

24:52.992 --> 24:55.962
WADE: Might as well
call it a pig roast, but

24:55.995 --> 24:58.931
height and size suggest
what's on the I.D.

24:58.965 --> 25:00.533
Shrapnel's consistent with

25:00.567 --> 25:03.235
what we found on the two
victims at the gala,

25:03.269 --> 25:04.737
ball bearing fragments.

25:04.771 --> 25:06.639
Back at autopsy,
I'll be able to

25:06.673 --> 25:09.542
confirm a match for the
accelerant, but, again,

25:09.576 --> 25:11.544
if I were playing
Final Jeopardy!,

25:11.578 --> 25:12.879
I'd bet everything I had.

25:16.082 --> 25:17.850
You were first on the scene.

25:17.884 --> 25:19.552
On my way here already.

25:19.586 --> 25:21.854
So you knew him,
and yet I don't detect

25:21.888 --> 25:23.590
the slightest bit of remorse.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.960
Not all dead
are worth grieving for.

25:27.994 --> 25:31.598
King, can I borrow you?

25:31.631 --> 25:33.299
Keep me posted on Laurel's boy.

25:36.636 --> 25:37.804
It's Dante, ain't it?

25:37.837 --> 25:39.205
Goes after me,

25:39.238 --> 25:41.107
goes after anyone
who talks to me.

25:41.140 --> 25:43.610
Found this by the blast site.

25:45.211 --> 25:48.114
It was clearly not
meant to be shrapnel, so...

25:48.147 --> 25:50.316
Maybe it's part
of the detonator.

25:50.349 --> 25:52.719
Damage patterns this
side of the room suggest

25:52.752 --> 25:54.687
the blast started
next to the furnace.

25:56.355 --> 25:58.991
Assuming Dante didn't want to
take any chances this time.

25:59.025 --> 26:00.793
If the blast wasn't
going to kill our victim,

26:00.827 --> 26:02.328
the ensuing fire
would seal the deal.

26:02.361 --> 26:04.864
And burns up the evidence
in the process.

26:04.897 --> 26:07.333
Not all of the evidence.
I found this.

26:09.168 --> 26:11.704
Crystallized.

26:11.738 --> 26:14.240
Stuff wasn't
at the first bombing.

26:14.273 --> 26:16.676
All right, get a sample
of that and that motor

26:16.709 --> 26:18.177
and get it
to Sebastian.

26:18.210 --> 26:19.712
BOTH:
On it.

26:25.117 --> 26:26.653
King, hold up a sec.

26:26.686 --> 26:29.055
I've been thinking,

26:29.088 --> 26:31.724
with nothing substantial to
go on and Dante planting bombs

26:31.758 --> 26:34.193
all over the city,
we might want to take a flyer...

26:34.226 --> 26:35.695
On?

26:35.728 --> 26:39.031
Grease wheels at Orleans
Parish, spring Ross P.

26:40.767 --> 26:43.402
His getting popped only
gives him more street cred.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.638
Ross P.'s fine where he is.

26:45.672 --> 26:49.308
I'm just saying, maybe we can
pull Dante into another buy.

26:49.341 --> 26:52.378
We'll find Dante another way.

26:52.411 --> 26:55.014
Every angle.

26:55.047 --> 26:58.017
That's what you've hammered
into me for the past ten years.

26:58.050 --> 27:01.187
And you won't let me
spring Ross P.?

27:01.220 --> 27:02.655
I don't get it, King.

27:02.689 --> 27:03.723
We got a guy in there

27:03.756 --> 27:04.657
that's fried to a crisp,

27:04.691 --> 27:06.158
maybe because he knows you,

27:06.192 --> 27:07.694
and I'm totally
left in the dark.

27:07.727 --> 27:10.362
You and I--

27:10.396 --> 27:12.398
I thought we kept no secrets.

27:18.237 --> 27:19.438
Get in the car, Christopher.

27:19.471 --> 27:22.008
LASALLE:
Where we headed?

27:22.041 --> 27:23.409
Out of the darkness.

27:25.311 --> 27:27.046
Paul Jenks was my CI.

27:27.079 --> 27:28.948
How you shut down
the Broussards.

27:28.981 --> 27:30.950
Yeah, two-bit hustler.

27:30.983 --> 27:33.119
And I used him to
gather the evidence

27:33.152 --> 27:34.721
to bring down the family.

27:34.754 --> 27:36.055
Along the way,

27:36.088 --> 27:38.290
Paul got himself
in all kinds

27:38.324 --> 27:40.727
of trouble,
which I scrubbed,

27:40.760 --> 27:43.896
'cause he was the bait,

27:43.930 --> 27:48.034
and I needed him to
reel in the big fish.

27:48.067 --> 27:50.369
Well, it worked.
Yeah.

27:50.402 --> 27:53.239
For a while.

27:53.272 --> 27:55.274
Here.

28:01.848 --> 28:03.482
Once the Broussards
were away,

28:03.515 --> 28:06.085
Paul tried to start
his own crew,

28:06.118 --> 28:08.921
holding up liquor
stores, grand theft,

28:08.955 --> 28:11.290
home invasion.

28:11.323 --> 28:13.826
November 3, 2002,

28:13.860 --> 28:15.094
Paul tried a grab-and-dash.

28:15.127 --> 28:17.229
Thought he'd get
TVs and computers.

28:17.263 --> 28:21.400
Instead, he got Martin Brooks,
ready to defend his family.

28:21.433 --> 28:24.837
BROOKS:
Get the hell out of my house!
Get out!

28:24.871 --> 28:27.173
PRIDE:
Martin chased Paul.

28:27.206 --> 28:29.041
Took a couple shots...

28:30.843 --> 28:32.812
Missed badly.

28:32.845 --> 28:34.113
And then,

28:34.146 --> 28:35.815
when Paul fired back...

28:37.817 --> 28:39.418
Stray bullet.

28:39.451 --> 28:40.787
Bedroom window.

28:40.820 --> 28:42.521
Inside, Sophie Brooks.

28:42.554 --> 28:45.157
My baby!

28:45.191 --> 28:48.360
Nine years old.
MOTHER: You shot my baby!

28:48.394 --> 28:51.798
My baby!

28:51.831 --> 28:54.166
It wasn't your fault, King.

28:54.200 --> 28:57.236
Fault? No.

28:57.269 --> 29:00.773
But the cost of looking
the other way.

29:02.441 --> 29:05.511
Paul's in a cell,
what happened here...

29:05.544 --> 29:07.213
doesn't.

29:08.447 --> 29:09.916
One question.

29:09.949 --> 29:12.952
If Paul killed that girl,
why was he out?

29:12.985 --> 29:14.553
Gun was never recovered

29:14.586 --> 29:16.255
and only a
partial fingerprint

29:16.288 --> 29:19.425
put Paul at the scene.

29:19.458 --> 29:22.194
I knew the case for murder
was never gonna make,

29:22.228 --> 29:24.463
but I'd be damn sure he
went down for something,

29:24.496 --> 29:26.899
so I dumped everything
I had on him.

29:26.933 --> 29:29.568
Put him away.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.570
Too little.

29:31.603 --> 29:34.473
Too late.

29:34.506 --> 29:35.975
Got to go.

29:36.008 --> 29:38.010
I'll drop you off.

29:46.585 --> 29:48.287
I got good news, bad news

29:48.320 --> 29:50.122
and kind of gross news.

29:50.156 --> 29:51.590
Good news is that I
identified that piece

29:51.623 --> 29:53.559
of hardware you found
at the blast site.

29:53.592 --> 29:55.862
It's a gear.
A mini-gear, actually,

29:55.895 --> 29:57.930
from some kind of motor.
What kind?

29:57.964 --> 30:00.166
Not sure. But we can rule out
a cell phone as the detonator.

30:00.199 --> 30:02.601
Won't find a mini-gear in those.
Nope. I'm leaning towards a

30:02.634 --> 30:05.604
timer mechanism, but, bad news--
I still don't have enough

30:05.637 --> 30:08.574
to definitively identify
the detonation device.

30:08.607 --> 30:10.609
That leaves us
with the gross news.
Yes.

30:10.642 --> 30:14.313
So, that white crystallized
substance you found is actually

30:14.346 --> 30:16.916
uric acid crystals. See,

30:16.949 --> 30:20.619
birds and reptiles, they don't,
uh, go number one...

30:20.652 --> 30:23.189
in a mammalian sense.
They excrete uric acid.

30:23.222 --> 30:25.257
When uric acid is heated
past its boiling point,

30:25.291 --> 30:26.592
it crystallizes.

30:26.625 --> 30:29.361
So our bomber tracks in
bird or reptile pee.

30:29.395 --> 30:30.930
How is that
supposed to be helpful?

30:30.963 --> 30:32.865
Well, because,
lucky for you, Agent Brody,

30:32.899 --> 30:35.201
I did a urinalysis
and found a high concentration

30:35.234 --> 30:37.003
of omega-3 fatty acids,

30:37.036 --> 30:40.372
the kinds that are found in, uh,
digested mackerel and sardines.

30:40.406 --> 30:41.974
It's a bird?
It's a plane,

30:42.008 --> 30:43.910
it's Superman. I'm sorry.

30:43.943 --> 30:45.511
That's a reflexive
reaction there.

30:45.544 --> 30:48.280
Anyway, the, uh,
brown pelican is the most

30:48.314 --> 30:49.882
common waterbird in the region.

30:49.916 --> 30:51.117
I would bet dollars to diatoms

30:51.150 --> 30:53.419
that is where your
substance came from.

30:53.452 --> 30:55.287
How are we supposed
to figure out where it is

30:55.321 --> 30:56.588
with pelican pee?

30:56.622 --> 30:58.925
The Audubon Society
created a sanctuary

30:58.958 --> 31:00.226
in Terrebonne Parish
for birds

31:00.259 --> 31:01.894
who were hurt in the
Deepwater Horizon spill.

31:01.928 --> 31:03.595
There's plenty
of brown pelicans there.

31:03.629 --> 31:06.232
And lots of square footage.

31:06.265 --> 31:08.034
Oh, let me help
you with that.

31:08.067 --> 31:10.937
You know what, no matter how
many times I tell a bad guy that

31:10.970 --> 31:14.106
cell phones are gonna undo them,
they never seem to learn. Okay.

31:14.140 --> 31:16.008
Now, Dante seems to cycle

31:16.042 --> 31:18.477
through ten or 12 phones.
He uses one phone,

31:18.510 --> 31:20.412
then he shuts it off,
then he's on to the next phone.

31:20.446 --> 31:23.115
So, no one phone will be useful

31:23.149 --> 31:24.616
in pinpointing him, but

31:24.650 --> 31:26.152
if we use the numbers
that we got

31:26.185 --> 31:27.686
from Paul Jenks,
Sasha Broussard,

31:27.719 --> 31:29.388
and the number
that Frank Broussard

31:29.421 --> 31:30.923
used to set up the sting,

31:30.957 --> 31:32.291
plot the points...

31:32.324 --> 31:33.960
you'll see a theme
start to develop.

31:33.993 --> 31:35.161
That's your cell tower.

31:35.194 --> 31:37.396
Less than a mile away
from the sanctuary.

31:37.429 --> 31:39.565
Looking at properties
in the area.

31:39.598 --> 31:43.669
Closest building--
an abandoned structure.

31:43.702 --> 31:46.372
And I'll bet
he's not building birdhouses.

31:56.082 --> 31:57.349
Hey, baby.

32:00.586 --> 32:05.057
They, um, induced a coma

32:05.091 --> 32:07.459
to reduce swelling in
the brain, they said.

32:12.064 --> 32:13.732
Got you something to eat.

32:13.765 --> 32:16.135
I'm not hungry.

32:25.477 --> 32:31.550
Your mother was always worried
about me bringing my work home.

32:34.453 --> 32:37.256
That bomb was intended
for me, Laurel.

32:39.791 --> 32:42.194
Is that what all
the security is about?

32:43.229 --> 32:44.997
I'm sorry for...

32:46.798 --> 32:49.235
...getting you and Orion
wrapped up in all this.

32:54.173 --> 32:56.742
Just tell me.

32:56.775 --> 32:59.445
Are you trying to make the city
a safer place?

32:59.478 --> 33:01.213
I am.

33:07.586 --> 33:10.056
That's good enough for me.

33:54.766 --> 33:56.168
NCIS!

33:56.202 --> 33:57.803
Hands in the air!

33:57.836 --> 33:58.804
BRODY:
Hands on your head.

33:58.837 --> 34:00.306
Now!

34:20.526 --> 34:23.462
Give me your hands.

34:23.495 --> 34:25.864
Let me put this
in terms you'll understand.

34:25.897 --> 34:28.667
Make another move,
and the gun goes boom.

34:37.776 --> 34:40.746
You tried to kill
Dwayne Pride.

34:40.779 --> 34:42.814
Much as I'd be fine and dandy
with all that,

34:42.848 --> 34:45.117
I didn't have anything to do
with either of these bombs

34:45.151 --> 34:46.818
you seem so obsessed about.

34:46.852 --> 34:49.655
Take it you got nothing to do
with the 20 kilos of cocaine

34:49.688 --> 34:51.423
you and your boys
were boxing up, too?

34:51.457 --> 34:55.627
BRODY:
Got to say, I admire
your sense of nostalgia.

34:55.661 --> 34:57.596
Both the devices you used

34:57.629 --> 35:00.799
match the explosive recipe your
father used during his reign.

35:00.832 --> 35:03.835
I was six
when my father went to prison.

35:03.869 --> 35:06.438
I didn't write the formula down
with crayons.

35:06.472 --> 35:08.340
Not hard to figure out
for a smart guy like you.

35:08.374 --> 35:09.841
You've heard of the Internet?

35:09.875 --> 35:12.144
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
that's that place

35:12.178 --> 35:13.879
with all those naked ladies,
right?

35:21.653 --> 35:24.323
Ah, well, there goes your case.

35:24.356 --> 35:25.824
How's that?

35:25.857 --> 35:27.526
Bombing was
on Wednesday?

35:27.559 --> 35:29.761
Well, I was elsewhere.

35:29.795 --> 35:31.530
AirTrans round trip,

35:31.563 --> 35:33.265
first class.

35:33.299 --> 35:35.834
Fountain Blue Hotel in Miami,
Presidential Suite.

35:36.902 --> 35:39.171
I got receipts.

35:39.205 --> 35:40.406
What were you doing?

35:40.439 --> 35:42.908
I was importing...

35:44.643 --> 35:46.845
...drugs.

35:46.878 --> 35:49.715
Your microphones got that,
right?

35:54.920 --> 35:58.224
Speak.

35:58.257 --> 36:00.692
I need to think
about something else.

36:00.726 --> 36:03.395
We pinned Dante
to the cocaine,

36:03.429 --> 36:05.731
but he can't
actually be the one

36:05.764 --> 36:07.866
that planted the
explosive in City Park.

36:07.899 --> 36:10.702
Using a drug buy
as an alibi for murder.

36:10.736 --> 36:12.471
First time for everything.

36:13.905 --> 36:15.841
Hey, guys.

36:15.874 --> 36:18.244
I, uh, brought some
violas for Orion.

36:18.277 --> 36:20.746
They're a good anti-inflammatory
and antipyretic,

36:20.779 --> 36:23.482
meaning they treat fevers
and bacterial infections.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.317
Also, they smell nice.

36:25.351 --> 36:27.786
Thank you.

36:27.819 --> 36:30.289
But you didn't run
all the way down here

36:30.322 --> 36:31.723
just to deliver flowers.

36:31.757 --> 36:33.492
No, I figured it out.

36:33.525 --> 36:35.994
It wasn't a timer or cell phone
that triggered the explosions.

36:36.027 --> 36:37.563
It was motion.

36:37.596 --> 36:40.366
More specifically
a motion sensor.

36:40.399 --> 36:42.000
You see, in the first explosion,
Orion dropped

36:42.033 --> 36:43.702
Laurel's jacket at a distance
of two and a half feet

36:43.735 --> 36:45.471
from the explosive device,

36:45.504 --> 36:46.872
which is the maximum
perceptive range

36:46.905 --> 36:48.006
of this infrared sensor.

36:48.039 --> 36:49.641
And, given the proximity

36:49.675 --> 36:51.377
of Paul's body to
the second device,

36:51.410 --> 36:53.979
that explosion was triggered
from the same distance.

36:54.012 --> 36:55.681
Do we know
where the bomber got it?

36:55.714 --> 36:57.316
No, see, that's the thing.

36:57.349 --> 36:59.351
I can't find a serial number
or design specifications

36:59.385 --> 37:01.887
that get me
to its place of origin.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.822
I'm sorry to let you down.

37:03.855 --> 37:06.492
No, we'll find something.

37:06.525 --> 37:09.861
I need... I need
to go clear my head.

37:09.895 --> 37:12.931
Will you... will you all
just watch Laurel for me?

37:55.374 --> 37:56.908
You're gonna pay
for that, right?

38:07.686 --> 38:09.821
I need you
to do something for me.

38:13.124 --> 38:15.794
You here?

38:15.827 --> 38:17.829
FRANK:
Thanks again, Sasha.

38:20.499 --> 38:22.334
I know we've never
been close,

38:22.368 --> 38:24.870
but you're doing me
a solid here.

38:24.903 --> 38:26.738
The least I could do.

38:26.772 --> 38:28.974
Ah. Man, I thought
I was screwed.

38:29.007 --> 38:31.042
Been hiding out in a shed.

38:31.076 --> 38:32.478
Didn't know where to go.

38:32.511 --> 38:34.045
I'm gonna set you up.

38:34.079 --> 38:38.584
Money, passport,
transport out of the country.

38:38.617 --> 38:40.919
Family's got to stick together.

38:40.952 --> 38:43.121
Yeah.

38:43.154 --> 38:44.956
The thing about that

38:44.990 --> 38:47.393
is...

38:47.426 --> 38:49.795
I've had enough
of this family.

38:52.598 --> 38:54.132
NCIS.

38:54.165 --> 38:56.435
Nice to see you
again, Frank.

38:56.468 --> 38:59.337
Sasha.

39:00.939 --> 39:03.008
Really?

39:07.446 --> 39:10.115
Let me guess.
He denied it.

39:10.148 --> 39:13.952
He's going with "framed,"
but it doesn't matter.

39:13.985 --> 39:18.156
The shed in the back--
ball bearings, chemicals,

39:18.189 --> 39:20.125
two more of these.

39:20.158 --> 39:22.594
Bomb squad disarmed it.

39:22.628 --> 39:24.963
Oh.

39:26.197 --> 39:27.866
You okay?

39:30.702 --> 39:33.605
I'm free... of all of them.

39:33.639 --> 39:35.474
Finally.

39:38.043 --> 39:41.813
And... maybe so are you.

39:47.152 --> 39:48.854
Excuse me.

39:48.887 --> 39:51.089
Sure.

39:51.122 --> 39:53.058
Hello?

39:53.091 --> 39:54.860
LAUREL:
He's awake, Daddy!

39:54.893 --> 39:57.162
Orion's up.

40:00.231 --> 40:02.701
Sorry to call you in,
but this couldn't wait.

40:02.734 --> 40:04.135
Oh, it's okay.

40:04.169 --> 40:06.204
I was just bringing Laurel
a change of clothes.

40:06.237 --> 40:08.039
What is it?

40:08.073 --> 40:10.842
The dental records for this
body don't match Paul Jenks.

40:10.876 --> 40:13.078
Jenks had fillings

40:13.111 --> 40:15.146
in the third canine
and the second premolar.

40:15.180 --> 40:18.183
This mouth-- full of
decay, no fillings,

40:18.216 --> 40:20.218
like the person
never saw a dentist.

40:20.251 --> 40:21.687
I'm thinking transient.

40:21.720 --> 40:23.088
You sure?

40:23.121 --> 40:24.556
Never been more so.

40:24.590 --> 40:27.158
I don't know who this is, but...

40:27.192 --> 40:29.461
Paul Jenks
is most probably alive.

40:30.929 --> 40:33.532
And likely the one
who bombed City Park.

40:39.805 --> 40:45.243
* Smiling faces sometimes

40:45.276 --> 40:48.914
* Pretend to be your friend

40:50.816 --> 40:53.585
* Smiling faces show no traces

40:55.787 --> 40:57.756
* Of the evil
that lurks within *

40:57.789 --> 41:00.826
* Can you dig it? *
* Smiling faces

41:00.859 --> 41:04.095
* Smiling faces sometimes

41:04.129 --> 41:07.666
* They don't tell the truth

41:07.699 --> 41:11.637
* Smiling faces, smiling faces

41:11.670 --> 41:16.007
* Tell lies and I got proof

41:16.041 --> 41:18.744
* Oh, yeah

41:32.824 --> 41:34.760
* They don't tell the...

41:34.793 --> 41:37.729
* The truth is in the eyes

41:37.763 --> 41:43.234
* 'Cause the eyes
don't lie, amen... *
