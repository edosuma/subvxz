08:12.432 --> 08:14.265
- I am Michael.

08:14.267 --> 08:17.335
Shawn did call me,
and I saw the Michael suit.

08:17.337 --> 08:19.370
He said
if the experiment failed,

08:19.372 --> 08:23.174
he was gonna use it to make you
think I was torturing you.

08:23.176 --> 08:24.242
- Why didn't you tell us?

08:24.244 --> 08:27.478
- Because he said he would
just erase your memories

08:27.480 --> 08:29.414
of me telling you,
so it wouldn't matter anyway.

08:29.416 --> 08:32.283
He thought that I would
crumble under the pressure.

08:32.285 --> 08:35.987
- But a month ago,
you told me you only pretended

08:35.989 --> 08:38.990
to freak out in order to get me
to step up and become a leader.

08:38.992 --> 08:40.725
- Yes, that also was a lie,

08:40.727 --> 08:42.827
but it was
an inspirational one.

08:42.829 --> 08:45.630

"So great running into you.

08:45.632 --> 08:47.165

some time,"

08:47.167 --> 08:49.100

08:49.102 --> 08:52.570

you found out the Bad Place

08:52.572 --> 08:54.172
made a Michael suit,
freaked out,

08:54.174 --> 08:56.641
didn't tell us why,
and then later,

08:56.643 --> 08:59.777
you lied to me
about why you freaked out?

08:59.779 --> 09:02.480

got a call from Shawn.

09:12.292 --> 09:15.860
Shawn sent Glenn to undermine
our trust in each other

09:15.862 --> 09:18.763

I'm gonna call The Judge.
We'll start over.

16:50.957 --> 16:52.690
We won't have Chidi in the mix,

16:52.692 --> 16:55.493
but he'll be on our side again,
which is almost as good.

16:55.495 --> 16:57.128
- But we know the humans now.

16:57.130 --> 16:59.297
Starting over
sounds exhausting.

16:59.299 --> 17:01.332
- I know,
but if that's not Michael,

17:01.334 --> 17:05.036
he could sabotage us
in ways we can't even perceive,

17:05.038 --> 17:07.939
and even if it is,
I can't fully trust him,

17:07.941 --> 17:09.274
so every time
something goes wrong,

17:09.276 --> 17:12.777
a little part of me
is gonna wonder.

17:12.779 --> 17:14.779
We have to start over.

17:14.781 --> 17:16.848
- I have a better idea.

17:16.850 --> 17:19.050
I'm gonna blow myself up.
all: What?

17:19.052 --> 17:19.984
- I'll blow myself up.

17:19.986 --> 17:22.353
That way,
you can continue the experiment

17:22.355 --> 17:24.055
with Chidi
as one of the people,

17:24.057 --> 17:27.125
which is our best chance
to ever be successful.

17:27.127 --> 17:28.860
- Why not just
lock you in a room

17:28.862 --> 17:30.862
or in Janet's void
or something?

17:30.864 --> 17:33.031
- But then you might worry
that I'd escape.

17:33.033 --> 17:35.066
I blow myself up,
I'm out of your hair for good.

17:35.068 --> 17:38.403
Well, parts of me will be
in your actual hair,

17:38.405 --> 17:40.505
but you get it.
- Michael, wait.

17:40.507 --> 17:42.340
- Tahani, this is the only way.

17:42.342 --> 17:44.242
There's literally
noting I can say

17:44.244 --> 17:48.046
that will make you realize
that I'm really me.

17:48.048 --> 17:50.048
Oh, boy.
This is gonna suck.

17:50.050 --> 17:52.884
Hopefully, I will see you all
in a few months. Good luck.

17:52.886 --> 17:54.986
Oh, and make sure that you, uh,

17:54.988 --> 17:57.188
get all of me
into the container,

17:57.190 --> 18:01.192
or I might come back
way shorter.

18:01.194 --> 18:04.162
And that would bum me out.
[device whirrs]

18:04.164 --> 18:08.233
I wish I were saying this in
different circumstances but...

18:10.036 --> 18:11.369
Take it sleazy.

18:11.371 --> 18:14.505
- Michael, wait!
[handcuffs whirr]

18:14.507 --> 18:17.642
- Oh, crud nuts.

18:18.442 --> 18:18.475
.

18:19.910 --> 18:21.678
- Jason, how did you know
that was bad Janet?

18:21.713 --> 18:23.813
- Michael said
there's nothing he could say

18:23.849 --> 18:26.016
that would make you realize
he's really him,

18:26.051 --> 18:27.851
but Janet does have a thing
she can say

18:27.886 --> 18:31.421
that does make me realize
she is really not her.

18:31.456 --> 18:32.656
- What?

18:32.691 --> 18:33.957
- I called Janet "girl,"

18:33.992 --> 18:35.492
but she didn't say,
"Not a girl."

18:35.527 --> 18:37.427
- The real Janet always says,

18:37.462 --> 18:39.963
"Not a girl."

18:39.998 --> 18:41.765
- [laughing]
Oh, wow.

18:41.800 --> 18:43.700
That realization is the only
thing that stopped me

18:43.735 --> 18:45.135
from becoming a pile of goo.

18:45.170 --> 18:46.670
Oh.
[device clatters]

18:46.705 --> 18:47.804
- Wait,
how did you pull it off?

18:47.839 --> 18:50.540
You were outside on the platform
with me the whole time.

18:50.575 --> 18:52.609
- We brought two
bad Janets on the train,

18:52.644 --> 18:54.778
you dumb, dumb idiot.

18:54.813 --> 18:57.213

18:57.249 --> 18:59.616

19:04.222 --> 19:06.489
<i> Stupid Michael never knew.</i>

19:06.525 --> 19:09.025
I had you fartknockers
fooled for weeks,

19:09.061 --> 19:11.494
until Glenn the traitor
ruined everything.

19:11.530 --> 19:14.197
That guy sucks, right?
[goo bubbles]

19:14.232 --> 19:16.232
Shut up, Glenn.

19:16.268 --> 19:17.100
[goo bubbles]
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

19:17.135 --> 19:19.903
Bad Janets can't impersonate
Good Janets.

19:19.938 --> 19:21.738
I've seen them try.
Their heads melt, so...

19:21.773 --> 19:24.007
- Oh.
Oh, you're so smart, sir.

19:24.042 --> 19:25.475
Well, listen, here's the thing.

19:25.510 --> 19:28.578
Shawn rebooted me,
like, 40 million tines.

19:28.613 --> 19:30.647
Wait, tine-him-is.

19:30.682 --> 19:33.683
Time-ses.
These things rule.

19:33.719 --> 19:35.919
- Oh, dip.
This means Janet didn't dump me.

19:35.954 --> 19:37.654
Her weird sister did.

19:37.689 --> 19:39.756
- Everything makes
so much more sense.

19:39.791 --> 19:42.759
All of Janet's ideas
were so counterproductive.

19:42.794 --> 19:44.661
She brought
the horse monster to life.

19:44.696 --> 19:47.197
She forced me
to antagonize John.

19:47.232 --> 19:50.667
She got us to doubt
Eleanor's leadership skills.

19:50.702 --> 19:52.769
- Oh, I was just
about to launch an idea

19:52.804 --> 19:54.037
where Tahani
was gonna give herself

19:54.072 --> 19:55.105
an asymmetrical haircut.

19:55.140 --> 19:56.740
- You monster.

19:56.775 --> 19:58.608
- Thank you!

19:58.643 --> 20:00.543
- Guys, we still have
a problem here.

20:00.579 --> 20:03.012
You still don't have evidence
that I'm actually me.

20:03.048 --> 20:04.214
- Sure, we do.

20:04.249 --> 20:05.782
You offered
to sacrifice yourself

20:05.817 --> 20:08.718
to help a bunch
of cockroaches.

20:08.754 --> 20:11.788
That's about the most
Michael thing you could do.

20:11.823 --> 20:13.690
- Then where's real Janet?

20:13.725 --> 20:15.258
- [laughing]
Oh, she's in the Bad Place.

20:15.293 --> 20:18.261
She's probably wiping her butt
with her own butt.

20:18.296 --> 20:19.462
[laughs]

20:19.498 --> 20:22.899
- I can't bear the idea of poor
Janet down there all alone.

20:22.934 --> 20:25.235
[sighs]
What should we do?

20:25.270 --> 20:27.704
- I know what to do.

20:27.739 --> 20:30.874
It's like what that guy
who blew up said.

20:30.909 --> 20:32.876
Shawn's a bully,

20:32.911 --> 20:35.145
and sometimes, the only thing
a bully understands

20:35.180 --> 20:37.814
is punch in the mouth.

20:37.849 --> 20:39.616
I'm gonna go down there,

20:39.651 --> 20:41.217
I'm gonna punch him
in the mouth,

20:41.253 --> 20:43.887
and I'm gonna get Janet back!

20:43.922 --> 20:46.222
- Oh, sounds like
somebody has a plan.

20:46.258 --> 20:47.991
- Dope.
Where is he?

20:48.026 --> 20:50.927
What's the plan?
- It's okay.

20:50.962 --> 20:53.830
<i> [bright music]</i>

20:53.865 --> 20:55.331
You sure you
can hold down the fort?

20:55.367 --> 20:58.334
- Not at all.
You sure you can do your thing?

20:58.370 --> 21:00.136
- Nope.

21:00.172 --> 21:03.339
We'll just try our best.
Right?

21:03.375 --> 21:05.341
Okay, let's go get our girl.

21:05.377 --> 21:07.677
