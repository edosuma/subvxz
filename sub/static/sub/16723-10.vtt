"Festival of Magic"?

00:21.976 --> 00:23.277
This whole town's
gonna be full

00:23.311 --> 00:25.212
of magicians
turning tricks!

00:25.213 --> 00:27.080
Hi, Jimmy, Jr.
Hi, Zeke.

00:27.081 --> 00:28.549
What are you
wearing?

00:28.550 --> 00:30.384
Is it cape o'clock,
already?

00:30.418 --> 00:31.952
It's for the Young
Magicians Competition.

00:31.953 --> 00:33.820
I'm in it to win it.

00:33.821 --> 00:36.290
Abraca-yeah-bro!
I support ya!

00:36.324 --> 00:37.558
I didn't know
you were into magic.

00:37.559 --> 00:38.859
I thought you were
more into dancing.

00:38.893 --> 00:42.095
Well, I dance a lot
during my magic. Like this.

00:43.298 --> 00:44.431
♪ Ta-da!

00:44.432 --> 00:46.133
Whoa! Where'd the hell
that come from?!

00:46.134 --> 00:47.968
He's like
a magical florist!

00:47.969 --> 00:49.503
Thank you. Oh.
Whoop!

00:49.504 --> 00:51.038
Maybe I'll come to the
competition and cheer for you.

00:51.072 --> 00:52.039
Whatever.
It's a free country.

00:52.073 --> 00:53.774
He's so patriotic.

00:53.808 --> 00:55.909
Okay, then, see you at our date.
It's not a date.

00:55.910 --> 00:57.110
Yes, it is.
Not really.

00:57.111 --> 00:59.346
Pretty much, it is a date.
Definitely not. Whoop.

01:00.949 --> 01:02.749
Oh, this promotion
is a great idea, Bob!

01:02.784 --> 01:04.284
I love magic!
I know. Me, too.

01:04.285 --> 01:06.153
Ooh, I'm gonna stick
a quarter in my ear,

01:06.154 --> 01:07.621
so they have something
to pull out.

01:07.655 --> 01:09.489
Yeah, the only problem is,

01:09.490 --> 01:11.491
this sign could actually
attract magicians, so...

01:11.492 --> 01:13.360
Louise, this will
be good for business.

01:13.361 --> 01:15.529
Plus, magic is fun.
Mm-mm.

01:15.530 --> 01:17.097
Magic can take you
to places

01:17.098 --> 01:18.198
you could never
possibly imagine.

01:18.199 --> 01:19.900
Like Delaware!

01:19.934 --> 01:22.936
Oh, look, here comes
our first magician.

01:22.937 --> 01:24.371
Or a Wild West
wedding DJ?

01:24.372 --> 01:26.907
Hello.
Hello...

01:26.941 --> 01:30.410
Hello. Um, I couldn't help
but notice your sign.

01:30.445 --> 01:32.379
Notice anything else?

01:32.380 --> 01:34.314
Whoops. Uh, oh, where'd
that come from?

01:34.349 --> 01:36.683
Uh, come on in, Mr., uh...

01:36.684 --> 01:37.918
Mars Sazerac.

01:37.952 --> 01:39.720
Boy, that is a...
magicky name.

01:39.721 --> 01:41.888
Hold on. How do we know
you're a magician?

01:41.889 --> 01:43.123
Show us a trick!

01:43.124 --> 01:44.791
Oh, write my name
on a piece of cake,

01:44.792 --> 01:46.226
put it in a box,
and I'll eat it!

01:46.227 --> 01:47.394
Sorry, don't
listen to him.

01:47.395 --> 01:49.162
He's just wants
to eat cake.

01:49.163 --> 01:52.366
Fine, write it on a piece of
pizza and put it under my desk.

01:52.367 --> 01:54.835
It's always gonna have something
to do with eating something.

01:54.836 --> 01:56.136
Just hiding food in places

01:56.137 --> 01:57.671
that he already knows
the location of.

01:57.705 --> 02:00.841
I mean, it would be nice to
see something, like a trick.

02:00.875 --> 02:05.145
Well, I suppose me and my 52
friends could use the exercise.

02:05.146 --> 02:06.546
Oh, God,
it's happening!

02:06.581 --> 02:08.715
Miss, could I ask you
to be my assistant?

02:08.750 --> 02:09.916
Oh, I couldn't. No.

02:09.917 --> 02:11.518
Okay I'll do it!

02:11.552 --> 02:14.354
Oh, that's right,
magicians have assistants...

02:20.028 --> 02:21.828
Ta-da.

02:21.863 --> 02:22.896
Now I'll need a volunteer

02:22.930 --> 02:23.530
Me!
Me!

02:23.531 --> 02:24.264
Me!
Me!

02:24.265 --> 02:25.232
Me!
Me...!

02:25.233 --> 02:26.733
Me!

02:26.768 --> 02:28.268
You're already
the assistant, Linda.

02:28.269 --> 02:29.369
Oh.
You win.

02:29.370 --> 02:31.038
No need to shout.
Thank you.

02:31.072 --> 02:32.506
Bye, Gene.
Bye.

02:32.507 --> 02:34.274
Okay, Bob, let's move
you over here

02:34.275 --> 02:35.275
so the audience
can see you.

02:35.276 --> 02:36.576
Right here?
Perfect.

02:36.577 --> 02:38.111
Now, you're going
to pick a card.

02:38.112 --> 02:39.613
And while you're doing that,

02:39.614 --> 02:41.114
Linda's going to get me
your biggest knife.

02:41.115 --> 02:42.949
I have it right here.
Butcher knife, check!

02:42.950 --> 02:44.351
Whoa, why do
you have that?

02:44.352 --> 02:45.519
Me and Gene
were playing pirates.

02:45.520 --> 02:46.887
Mm-hmm.

02:46.888 --> 02:49.022
Pick a card, Bob.
Show it to them, not me.

02:49.057 --> 02:50.524
Okay, everyone, here's my card.

02:50.558 --> 02:51.925
Nice one, Dad.
Okay.

02:51.926 --> 02:53.593
That was not a
very good trick.

02:53.628 --> 02:55.696
Now, Linda,
cut the deck, literally.

02:55.697 --> 02:57.197
Go on! Whack it!

02:57.198 --> 02:58.598
All right, step back.
Whaaah!

02:58.633 --> 03:00.200
Whoa!
Still not a great trick.

03:00.201 --> 03:02.135
Well, well, looks like
we have a survivor.

03:02.136 --> 03:03.537
Recognize this?!

03:03.538 --> 03:04.971
Ha-ha!

03:04.972 --> 03:06.373
That's not my card.
Oh.

03:06.407 --> 03:07.541
Hit the bricks,
Fail-dini!

03:07.542 --> 03:08.909
You had your shot,
you blew it.

03:08.943 --> 03:11.078
Well, so much for
the magician's discount.

03:11.079 --> 03:13.780
In fact, maybe
I should pay you.

03:13.781 --> 03:15.282
Wait... that looks
like my wallet.

03:15.283 --> 03:16.950
Did you take my wallet?

03:16.951 --> 03:18.585
Oh-ho-ho, slow down,
there, Bob.

03:18.586 --> 03:21.588
Before you call the cops,
you'd better check the I.D.

03:21.622 --> 03:23.490
My card!

03:23.491 --> 03:24.758
Oh, my!

03:24.792 --> 03:26.259
Wait... how did you
pick my pocket?

03:26.260 --> 03:27.194
I didn't feel anything.

03:27.228 --> 03:28.829
Oh, I feel something.

03:28.830 --> 03:31.098
I feel like I want
to magically steal things, too.

03:31.099 --> 03:33.266
This must be what it's like when
people get called to the priesthood.

03:33.301 --> 03:34.968
I accept.

03:37.505 --> 03:38.638
Whoa!

03:38.673 --> 03:40.841
I've seen canned tuna,
but never canned Tina!

03:40.842 --> 03:42.943
Ugh! You're such
a locker stalker.

03:42.944 --> 03:44.144
Good one, Tammy.
I know.

03:44.178 --> 03:45.746
Oh, hi, Jimmy Jr.

03:45.747 --> 03:48.982
It's like I was padlocked
in a box, and you set me free.

03:50.251 --> 03:52.185
Um, okay.
Hi.

03:52.186 --> 03:53.754
How did you know
my locker combination?

03:53.755 --> 03:55.355
It only took
a couple thousand tries.

03:55.356 --> 03:56.823
Allow me.
Okay.

03:56.824 --> 03:58.759
Is there anything else
I could assist you with?

03:58.793 --> 04:00.761
Uh, I need to get
my science book.

04:00.795 --> 04:02.796
This perfectly ordinary textbook.
Thanks.

04:02.797 --> 04:05.265
You know, I could also assist
you with your magic act

04:05.266 --> 04:07.000
as your magician's assistant.

04:07.034 --> 04:08.668
Classy.
Like a lady butler.

04:08.703 --> 04:11.638
Um, okay, I-I guess
you could do that.

04:11.639 --> 04:12.606
I practice after school.

04:12.607 --> 04:15.442
Oh, okay, cool.
All right, see ya.

04:16.611 --> 04:17.711
Yes! Yes! Yes!

04:17.712 --> 04:18.978
What? What?

04:19.012 --> 04:21.548
Oh, I just found a cool book
I've been meaning to read.

04:21.548 --> 04:22.482
Oh, it's mine.

04:22.483 --> 04:24.284
Oh.
That's his!

04:24.285 --> 04:27.154
Can I borrow it? No,
I don't think so. I kinda need it.

04:27.155 --> 04:28.655
Okay, I'll
read it here. Bye.

04:35.656 --> 04:37.624
Um, Jimmy Junior?!

04:37.625 --> 04:39.459
What, Tina?

04:39.460 --> 04:41.527
Maybe I should be facing
the audience, too?

04:41.528 --> 04:42.929
Fine.

04:45.599 --> 04:47.634
Um... okay, there's more?

04:47.635 --> 04:49.802
Remember?

04:49.837 --> 04:53.373
The blades?
I remember!

04:58.112 --> 04:59.279
Stupid magic.

04:59.280 --> 05:02.515
♪ Ta-dance!

05:02.516 --> 05:04.951
Uh, hello? Jimmy Jr.?

05:04.952 --> 05:06.252
What, Tina?

05:06.287 --> 05:08.755
If this were a dancing
competition, forget about it.

05:08.789 --> 05:11.157
But you might want to put a little
more flair into the actual magic.

05:11.158 --> 05:12.625
What makes you such
an expert, Tina?

05:12.660 --> 05:14.794
You've only been doing
magic for a day.

05:14.795 --> 05:17.063
I've been doing it
for nine days!

05:17.064 --> 05:19.532
Jimmy Jr., they spilled a crate
of yogurt in the cafeteria!

05:19.533 --> 05:20.533
Let's go slide
around in it!

05:20.534 --> 05:21.968
Cool, Zeke.

05:21.969 --> 05:23.903
Come on! Let's go!
Wait up, Zeke!

05:23.904 --> 05:25.138
Okay, I'll be here.

05:25.139 --> 05:27.507
Sweep up all the
confetti, okay?

05:27.541 --> 05:30.777
Okay, Gene, let's start
with an easy mark.

05:30.811 --> 05:32.278
Uh, there we go.

05:32.313 --> 05:34.180
You distract
while I extract.

05:34.181 --> 05:35.515
Got it.

05:35.549 --> 05:37.383
Andy, there's something
I need to ask you,

05:37.384 --> 05:39.052
but you have
to really focus on me

05:39.053 --> 05:41.521
while I'm saying
these words!

05:41.555 --> 05:43.222
Oh, okay!
I'll focus, too!

05:43.223 --> 05:45.058
I've never done
that before!

05:45.092 --> 05:47.360
What do you think of bacon?
Hmm?

05:47.394 --> 05:48.895
Bacon, bacon, bacon.

05:48.896 --> 05:50.830
Andy, someone's trying
to steal your candy!

05:50.831 --> 05:51.931
Ugh!
Thanks, Ollie!

05:51.932 --> 05:53.166
You're welcome, Andy!

05:53.200 --> 05:54.867
Damn it, Ollie!
How did you know?!

05:54.868 --> 05:56.903
I felt it coming out
of Andy's pocket!

05:56.904 --> 05:59.305
Get a womb,
you wacky twins.

05:59.340 --> 06:00.506
That hurt my feelings.

06:00.507 --> 06:01.874
I felt it hurt
your feelings!

06:01.875 --> 06:03.176
You did?
Yes!

06:06.947 --> 06:09.215
Ah-choo!
Oh, I wish somebody had

06:09.216 --> 06:13.586
a really long handkerchief
up their sleeve. Anybody? Hmm?

06:13.620 --> 06:14.921
Come on.
Where's the pizazz-matazz?

06:14.922 --> 06:16.356
I thought they'd
get more food.

06:16.357 --> 06:18.391
They split an order
of fries three hours ago

06:18.392 --> 06:19.859
and they haven't ordered
anything since.

06:19.860 --> 06:21.227
Now they're just
loitering.

06:21.228 --> 06:23.196
They tricked you, Bob!
It's what they do!

06:23.230 --> 06:26.132
So, Sazerac, can I get you
and your friends anything else?

06:26.133 --> 06:29.068
Remember, it's half off,
so don't hold back.

06:29.069 --> 06:32.638
Ah, well, your delicious fries
have left my fingers greasy.

06:32.639 --> 06:35.408
Bring me a huge plate
of napkins.

06:35.442 --> 06:37.410
Well, how 'bout a burger?
I can get you a...

06:37.444 --> 06:38.611
Napkins.
All right, napkins.

06:38.612 --> 06:40.079
Get him a napkin.

06:40.080 --> 06:41.848
Hey, Bob, I think he
got your wallet again.

06:41.882 --> 06:43.916
And keys!

06:43.917 --> 06:45.151
And your gas pills!

06:45.152 --> 06:46.819
And your dignity.

06:46.820 --> 06:48.154
Ha-ha, ha-ha-ha,
great.

06:49.556 --> 06:50.990
Hi, I'm looking for

06:50.991 --> 06:52.325
a magician's
assistant's costume.

06:52.326 --> 06:53.326
Something classy!

06:53.327 --> 06:55.094
So no butt cheek!

06:55.129 --> 06:56.562
Well, you're in luck!

06:56.563 --> 06:58.564
This is my last assistant's
costume in your size.

06:58.599 --> 07:00.666
The sequins are French crystal.

07:00.667 --> 07:02.268
Well, French-Canadian.
Is that good?

07:02.269 --> 07:03.636
How much do you know
about sequins?

07:03.670 --> 07:05.271
Nothing.
They're the best.

07:05.272 --> 07:06.406
She'll take it!

07:06.407 --> 07:07.874
Rented!
Okay, what else?

07:07.908 --> 07:09.542
How's your magician set
for cups and balls?

07:09.576 --> 07:10.710
I beg your pardon!

07:13.480 --> 07:14.747
Oh...

07:14.748 --> 07:16.449
That looks pretty advanced.

07:16.450 --> 07:18.451
My magician's better
with his feet than his hands.

07:18.452 --> 07:20.153
He's more
of a dance-ician?

07:20.187 --> 07:23.890
Well, for those with only the
slightest sleight-of-hand,

07:23.924 --> 07:25.792
you can't go wrong
with magic rope.

07:25.793 --> 07:26.959
♪ Ta-da!

07:26.994 --> 07:28.428
Great.
I'll take that too.

07:28.429 --> 07:30.630
The only thing I need now
is some magic

07:30.631 --> 07:31.931
between me and my magician.

07:31.965 --> 07:33.366
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

07:33.367 --> 07:35.768
Are you talking
about mixing magic and romance?

07:35.803 --> 07:36.469
Big time.

07:36.470 --> 07:37.870
Don't do it!

07:37.871 --> 07:39.472
It's dangerous.
Also, don't mix

07:39.473 --> 07:41.107
magic with taxes.
Or plumbing.

07:41.108 --> 07:42.975
That's okay... danger
is my middle name.

07:42.976 --> 07:45.945
But I spell it R-U-T-H.
It spells Ruth.

07:45.946 --> 07:47.550
Yeah. Yeah, it does. Mm-hmm.

07:49.049 --> 07:50.950
Looks like there's
a wait, huh?

07:50.984 --> 07:52.218
Yeah.

07:52.219 --> 07:53.553
Maybe I'll just
come back later.

07:53.554 --> 07:54.887
Oh, hold on,
that guy's getting up.

07:54.888 --> 07:56.622
No, he's levitating!

07:56.623 --> 07:58.391
What? Nope,
he was just leaning over to fart.

07:58.392 --> 07:59.725
You know what?
I'll handle this.

07:59.726 --> 08:00.860
What are you
gonna do?

08:00.861 --> 08:02.195
Yeah, wait, you'll see.
What?

08:02.196 --> 08:04.163
Look, guys, you've been here
all day

08:04.164 --> 08:06.099
working on one order
of fries, so...

08:06.133 --> 08:07.200
Understood, Bob.

08:07.201 --> 08:08.468
Let me settle my tab.

08:08.469 --> 08:11.170
Do you have change for this?

08:11.171 --> 08:13.673
Sorry I don't have
anything smaller.

08:14.842 --> 08:16.375
No, you know what?
To be honest, Sazerac,

08:16.376 --> 08:18.344
I don't even enjoy
this anymore.

08:18.378 --> 08:21.447
I don't, I, I, honestly don't
even like magic that much now,

08:21.482 --> 08:23.950
because of you.

08:23.984 --> 08:26.219
So, you and your friends,
you now all pay full price.

08:26.220 --> 08:28.121
No magicians' discount.

08:28.155 --> 08:30.656
Well, if that's how you feel,
you can have your fries back.

08:32.592 --> 08:33.392
Oh, my God.

08:33.393 --> 08:35.027
Oh, God!

08:36.363 --> 08:37.964
Look, it says "Ta-da"!

08:37.998 --> 08:40.666
That's it!
I don't care that that was good.

08:40.667 --> 08:43.535
You and your regurgitated
potatoes and the rest

08:43.537 --> 08:45.404
of your magic buddies,
you're banned!

08:45.439 --> 08:47.840
Bob, you can't just ban them!

08:47.841 --> 08:49.408
This isn't the '60s,
you know!

08:49.443 --> 08:51.210
Fellow conjurers,
let's go somewhere

08:51.211 --> 08:53.012
our craft is
appreciated.

08:53.013 --> 08:55.214
Like my mother's!

08:55.249 --> 08:57.517
Oh, and one
last thing, Bob.

08:57.518 --> 08:59.051
Your name goes
in the book.

08:59.052 --> 09:02.088
What book?
The "Enemies of Magic" book.

09:02.089 --> 09:04.090
Good! I want to be
in your stupid book

09:04.091 --> 09:06.325
because I <i>am</i>
an enemy of magic!

09:06.360 --> 09:08.294
Well, then this is
the perfect book for you!

09:08.295 --> 09:09.662
Will this page do?

09:09.696 --> 09:10.695
Love it!

09:11.899 --> 09:13.633
Don't gasp, Linda!

09:13.634 --> 09:15.201
Oh!
Don't you gasp!

09:15.202 --> 09:16.102
Rest assured, Bob,

09:16.103 --> 09:17.403
I will never set foot

09:17.404 --> 09:18.938
in this restaurant again.

09:18.939 --> 09:21.774
And yet, you will never be
rid of me!

09:24.411 --> 09:26.846
I just got chills!
Oh, my God.

09:26.880 --> 09:30.116
Come on, J-Ju,
get your dance on!

09:30.117 --> 09:31.551
I'm doing it, Zeke.

09:31.552 --> 09:32.852
My little tiny dancer.

09:32.886 --> 09:34.420
Here we go!

09:34.421 --> 09:36.381
Look, Jimmy Jr. I got something
new for our act...

09:36.390 --> 09:37.957
magic rope.

09:37.958 --> 09:40.927
Cool! A rope!
No, that's not how it works.

09:40.928 --> 09:42.628
Yee-hah! Whoo!

09:42.663 --> 09:44.230
No... Giddy up, magic cowboy!
Come on!

09:44.231 --> 09:45.932
Look, you're supposed
to cut the rope,

09:45.933 --> 09:47.633
then restore it.
I can show you.

09:47.634 --> 09:48.968
Oh, cool, scissors!
Hyah! Hyah!

09:48.969 --> 09:51.771
Jimmy Jr., stop.
Snipping and a-whipping.

09:51.772 --> 09:52.638
Doola-di-doo!

09:52.673 --> 09:55.141
Jimmy Jr., stop.
Tina, move!

09:55.175 --> 09:57.476
Listen to me!
Stop it, Tina. I can't dance

09:57.477 --> 09:59.545
to the sound
of you telling me what to do.

09:59.580 --> 10:00.813
Yeah! Boom!

10:00.814 --> 10:02.048
I'm trying to help.

10:02.082 --> 10:03.849
Assist me assist you.

10:03.850 --> 10:06.018
You know what, Tina?
This isn't working.

10:06.019 --> 10:07.420
That's why we have
to keep practicing.

10:07.421 --> 10:09.555
No, <i>this</i> isn't working.

10:09.590 --> 10:10.790
I am firing you.

10:11.692 --> 10:12.691
What?

10:12.693 --> 10:14.660
You can't stop my dancing!

10:14.661 --> 10:16.829
You can't tie me up
with your magic rope!

10:16.863 --> 10:18.898
Holy moly!
Tell it, James Ju!

10:18.932 --> 10:21.767
I'm not trying to tie you up,
you gorgeous idiot!

10:21.802 --> 10:23.936
Maybe I should enter this stupid
contest myself

10:23.937 --> 10:26.005
just to show you
an actual magic act!

10:26.039 --> 10:27.640
You see that, Zeke?

10:27.641 --> 10:29.775
Yeah.
She got pretty mad.

10:29.810 --> 10:31.110
She's a trip.

10:31.144 --> 10:32.345
Her face turned purple.

10:32.379 --> 10:34.780
Plus, you're not even
a magician, Tina.

10:34.781 --> 10:36.015
I am now!

10:36.016 --> 10:37.516
Oh.

10:37.517 --> 10:38.618
It worked in the store. Look, Zeke,

10:38.619 --> 10:40.486
tassels!
Yeah!

10:40.487 --> 10:41.687
Come on, let me touch 'em.

10:45.847 --> 10:47.080
So, you and
your magician split up...

10:47.081 --> 10:48.182
big surprise.

10:48.183 --> 10:49.683
Jimmy Junior
thinks assistants

10:49.684 --> 10:51.018
should be sequined
and not heard.

10:51.019 --> 10:52.386
So, presto.

10:52.387 --> 10:53.620
Now I'm the magician.

10:53.621 --> 10:55.289
So, uh... what do
you got for this

10:55.290 --> 10:56.857
no-trick pony, eh?
Set her up.

10:56.891 --> 10:58.592
Young lady, you're in luck.

10:58.593 --> 11:00.394
Here's a classic
of escapology...

11:00.395 --> 11:01.628
the straitjacket.

11:01.629 --> 11:02.930
Last one in your size.

11:02.931 --> 11:04.932
It just takes
a little bit of practice

11:04.933 --> 11:06.600
and some dislocateable
shoulders.

11:06.634 --> 11:08.569
I'll dislocate
Jimmy Junior's heart...

11:08.570 --> 11:09.770
and my shoulders.

11:09.804 --> 11:11.071
You sound like
you could use

11:11.072 --> 11:12.573
the full
revenge package.

11:12.574 --> 11:15.075
For just $19.95,
you could get this...

11:15.109 --> 11:17.544
Hmm... interesting.

11:17.579 --> 11:19.813
<i>When Doves Cry.</i>

11:19.814 --> 11:21.381
<i>The Art of
Magic Sabotage.</i>

11:21.382 --> 11:23.116
No, thanks.
I want to win fair and square.

11:23.151 --> 11:25.052
Keeping it clean?
I have just the thing.

11:25.053 --> 11:26.386
A-ha.

11:26.421 --> 11:28.622
<i>A Guide to Not Cheating</i>

11:28.656 --> 11:29.990
<i>in Magic Competitions.</i>

11:29.991 --> 11:31.892
I'll just take
the straitjacket.

11:31.893 --> 11:33.660
It's not going to be
the last time she says that.

11:33.661 --> 11:35.062
It's our
family motto!

11:37.632 --> 11:38.866
<i>Wow.</i>

11:38.900 --> 11:40.067
This place looks
pretty big

11:40.068 --> 11:41.101
without all those
magicians in it.

11:41.135 --> 11:42.302
Ah! Oh! Whoa!

11:42.303 --> 11:43.871
Oh!

11:43.905 --> 11:45.572
Oh... Wow,
that's never happened before.

11:45.573 --> 11:46.940
That flustered
the heck out of me.

11:46.941 --> 11:48.475
Can I get some
water, Bobby?

11:48.476 --> 11:51.078
Yeah, sure.

11:51.112 --> 11:52.579
What the hell?

11:52.580 --> 11:53.780
Bobby,
it's the curse!

11:53.815 --> 11:54.948
Oh!
What curse?

11:54.983 --> 11:56.116
The Curse of Sazerac!

11:56.150 --> 11:57.985
Linda's right, Bob.

11:57.986 --> 11:59.419
You're cursed. You're in
the "Enemies of Magic" book.

11:59.454 --> 12:00.754
We're not cursed.

12:00.755 --> 12:02.122
<i>We're</i> not cursed.
You are.

12:02.123 --> 12:03.423
You're the one who's cursed. Yeah.

12:03.424 --> 12:04.758
It's your name
in the book.

12:04.759 --> 12:06.460
The black magic
death book.

12:06.461 --> 12:08.328
Look, it's just
a bunch of stupid tricks.

12:08.329 --> 12:09.963
Someone must've
snuck in and...

12:09.964 --> 12:11.198
Where are you going?

12:11.199 --> 12:12.966
What?
Nowhere.

12:12.967 --> 12:14.601
Just, if something heavy falls
on you, I don't want to...

12:14.602 --> 12:16.169
I mean, I want to be
able to help you, bye.

12:16.170 --> 12:17.437
I'm not cursed!

12:17.438 --> 12:18.839
Aah!
I don't want to die!

to being an assistant.

No...

you're really

Hah!

12:59.981 --> 13:01.481
Tammy?
What are you doing?

13:01.516 --> 13:03.183
I'm Jimmy Junior's
new assistant.

13:03.217 --> 13:04.217
You coul't en wait

13:04.218 --> 13:05.652
until the Zig-Zag box was cold?

13:05.653 --> 13:07.654
Oh, I thought I smelled
your B.O. in there.

13:07.655 --> 13:09.856
Uh-oh. Battle of
the training bras.

13:09.891 --> 13:12.225
I feel like I'm back
in diapers at divorce court!

13:12.260 --> 13:13.527
You know what
really stinks, Tammy?

13:13.528 --> 13:14.828
His act.

13:14.829 --> 13:16.763
It's not magic,
it's tragic.

13:16.764 --> 13:18.765
Don't be such a rhymin' hymen,
Tina. Yeah, Tina.

13:18.766 --> 13:20.667
You're not even good at it.
Yeah, Tina.

13:20.668 --> 13:22.502
Oh, Jimmy Junior,
you make me so mad!

13:22.503 --> 13:23.704
What are you gonna
do about it?

13:23.738 --> 13:25.405
I'll take it.

13:25.440 --> 13:26.773
Here you go!

13:29.677 --> 13:31.345
Do you have something
caught in your throat?

13:31.346 --> 13:32.846
That was my evil laugh.

13:32.847 --> 13:34.514
I also have something
caught in my throat.

13:36.548 --> 13:38.616
And... we're in.

13:38.650 --> 13:40.484
His magic cape
won't be so magic

13:40.485 --> 13:42.987
when the hidden pockets
are stapled shut.

13:44.389 --> 13:46.590
Guys, code red,
Hocus and Dopus!

13:46.591 --> 13:47.858
Tina, start stapling!

13:47.859 --> 13:49.360
Hurry!

13:49.361 --> 13:50.594
Done.

13:51.896 --> 13:53.163
Go! Split up!

13:54.399 --> 13:56.900
You missed
the cape, Tina!

13:56.935 --> 13:58.836
Oh, hi, Jimmy Junior.

13:58.837 --> 14:01.839
We were just leaving
in that direction.

14:01.873 --> 14:03.941
Man, I wish
I had siblings

14:03.942 --> 14:05.209
I could walk
that close with.

14:05.210 --> 14:07.211
My brother's 44.

14:07.212 --> 14:08.612
<i>There has to be
something else</i>

14:08.613 --> 14:10.547
in here that will
ruin Jimmy Junior.

14:10.548 --> 14:12.516
This one would be great,
if we had eight weeks,

14:12.517 --> 14:14.385
25 rabbits,
and a fireman's hose.

14:14.386 --> 14:15.719
Ooh, look at
this one.

14:15.720 --> 14:16.954
"Find the heart of his act,

14:16.955 --> 14:18.222
and cut it out."

14:18.223 --> 14:19.556
Like when Shelley
Long left <i>Cheers.</i>

14:19.557 --> 14:20.758
Okay, Tina,

14:20.792 --> 14:22.693
time to put on
your straitjacket.

14:22.727 --> 14:24.795
Oh, all this white,
it's like your wedding day.

14:24.796 --> 14:26.096
Oh, I'm tearing up!

14:26.131 --> 14:27.398
Thank you, Mother.

14:27.399 --> 14:29.033
I must prepare.

14:29.034 --> 14:31.101
Boy, she's really
in the zone, huh?

14:31.136 --> 14:32.870
Uh, I think I should
stay here, Lin.

14:32.871 --> 14:34.872
Protect the restaurant
from another Sazerac attack.

14:34.873 --> 14:36.206
A Saz attack.

14:36.241 --> 14:37.608
Forget the restaurant, Bob.

14:37.609 --> 14:39.109
You're gonna be cursed,
no matter what.

14:39.110 --> 14:40.944
You might as well come
support your daughter.

14:40.979 --> 14:42.313
And let's be
honest, Dad,

14:42.314 --> 14:43.981
how much more cursed
can you really get?

14:43.982 --> 14:46.216
What, is he gonna give you
an even weirder body?

14:46.217 --> 14:48.052
Thanks, Louise.
You got it.

14:51.089 --> 14:53.624
Great. Sazerac's the emcee.

14:53.658 --> 14:55.292
I can't get away
from that idiot.

14:55.293 --> 14:57.761
So... maybe...
I'm going to get even with him.

14:57.762 --> 14:58.996
What?

14:58.997 --> 15:00.264
I mean...
uh, nothing.

15:00.265 --> 15:02.433
Be right back.
Good luck, Tina.

15:02.467 --> 15:04.501
Okay, my little
Teenie-Weenie Houdini!

15:04.502 --> 15:05.769
Go kick some butt!

15:05.770 --> 15:07.504
Some butt,
or one butt?

15:07.505 --> 15:08.772
Okay...

15:08.773 --> 15:10.107
We need to go,
too, Mom.

15:10.108 --> 15:11.342
Uh, I'm Tina's...

15:11.343 --> 15:12.676
silk scarf wrangler.

15:12.677 --> 15:14.611
And I'm the one who
has to make sure

15:14.612 --> 15:16.080
there's nothing
up her sleeves.

15:16.081 --> 15:17.414
I love that.

15:17.415 --> 15:19.483
All right, Team Tina!
Go, Team Tina!

15:26.257 --> 15:29.626
Enjoy your complimentary
cold-cuts, Saza-jerk!

15:33.098 --> 15:34.431
The "Enemies of Magic" book!

15:35.967 --> 15:37.868
David Cassidy?
Larry Bird?!

15:37.869 --> 15:39.303
Diane Keaton?

15:39.304 --> 15:40.971
Ha!
My name's not in your book

15:41.005 --> 15:44.174
anymore, Sazerac,
but this is!

15:46.378 --> 15:47.845
Uh-oh, that's not good.

15:47.846 --> 15:49.880
Ow.
That's a peppercorn.

15:56.821 --> 15:58.055
Say that again.

15:58.056 --> 15:59.456
Now we cut out the heart

15:59.457 --> 16:01.792
of Jimmy Junior's act
and put in this.

16:01.793 --> 16:04.128
"Poly-rhythmic
synth-jazz"!

16:04.129 --> 16:05.529
No one can
dance to that.

16:05.530 --> 16:07.164
That's right.
Not even Jimmy Junior.

16:07.165 --> 16:08.866
Yeah!

16:08.867 --> 16:10.868
Here's the new music
for Jimmy Junior's act.

16:10.869 --> 16:13.704
Um, I don't see anything
on my list about new music.

16:13.738 --> 16:15.839
Look, we did a Kickstarter
to make this music

16:17.375 --> 16:19.476
Oh, okay, okay!
All right!

16:21.045 --> 16:22.746
Oh, boy.

16:22.747 --> 16:24.548
I snuck into Sazerac's
dressing room

16:24.549 --> 16:27.351
and I found his stupid
book and tore my name out.

16:27.352 --> 16:28.585
What?
You did what?

16:28.586 --> 16:29.853
Ooh...

16:29.854 --> 16:31.054
Ooh, you smell
like salami.

16:31.089 --> 16:32.523
Thank you, and welcome

16:32.524 --> 16:34.491
to the Young Magician's
Competition!

16:34.492 --> 16:37.161
These kids are the magic stars
of the future.

16:37.162 --> 16:38.562
Well, not all of them.

16:38.563 --> 16:39.830
Some will give up,

16:39.831 --> 16:41.498
become teachers, doctors...

16:42.667 --> 16:43.667
I know, I know.

16:43.668 --> 16:45.169
I agree, but come on.

16:45.170 --> 16:46.670
Let's hear it for
our first contestant,

16:46.671 --> 16:48.605
The Amazing Jimmy Pesto Junior

16:48.606 --> 16:50.841
and his assistant,
Tammy Larson!

16:53.244 --> 16:54.511
That's not my music.

16:54.512 --> 16:55.712
Just go with it.

16:59.951 --> 17:01.518
I can't dance
to this!

17:04.756 --> 17:06.356
Damn it!

17:06.357 --> 17:08.258
It looks like he's
having a funky stroke.

17:08.259 --> 17:09.893
I miss you, Grandpa!

17:09.928 --> 17:12.128
This doesn't bother me at all,

17:12.130 --> 17:13.797
watching my almost
boyfriend get

17:13.798 --> 17:15.365
horribly humiliated...

17:15.366 --> 17:17.134
Ah! Yes, it does!
I can't do this!

17:17.135 --> 17:19.136
I gotta save him.
It's not too late.

17:21.039 --> 17:22.705
Oh, maybe it is too late.

17:22.707 --> 17:24.308
Still, I've gotta try.

17:26.377 --> 17:28.111
What are you doing out here?

17:28.112 --> 17:29.780
Trying to save you.
I switched your music

17:29.781 --> 17:31.482
to something with
a nine-eight time signature.

17:31.483 --> 17:33.116
That's like dance Kryptonite!

17:33.151 --> 17:35.285
I know, I'm sorry.
I was really mad at you

17:35.286 --> 17:37.287
for firing me and for
replacing me with Tammy.

17:37.322 --> 17:39.756
I'm sorry, too, for being
so sensitive about my dancing.

17:39.757 --> 17:41.258
So what do we do now?

17:41.292 --> 17:43.727
We have the rest of our
lives to figure that out.

17:43.728 --> 17:46.096
No, I mean right now. Oh.

17:46.097 --> 17:47.564
Get off
the stage, Tina!

17:47.599 --> 17:48.832
You're not his assistant.

17:48.833 --> 17:50.067
I am! Deal with it!

17:50.068 --> 17:51.435
Sorry, Tammy,
I can't hear you

17:51.436 --> 17:52.402
while you're rolling
away so fast.

17:52.403 --> 17:54.538
Aah!

17:54.572 --> 17:55.572
Hi, Tammy!
Bye, Tammy!

17:55.573 --> 17:56.707
Great magic!

17:56.741 --> 17:58.308
Well, should I
do a trick?

17:58.343 --> 17:59.810
No, I'll be the magician

17:59.811 --> 18:02.112
and you assist me
with your dancing.

18:02.146 --> 18:04.581
I told you, I can't
dance to this music!

18:04.582 --> 18:06.817
And I probably can't
get out of this.

18:06.818 --> 18:08.919
But follow my lead anyway.
Okay, Tina.

18:08.953 --> 18:10.187
Is this part of the show?

18:10.188 --> 18:11.755
Yeah, right?
Do a trick!

18:11.756 --> 18:14.591
And now, with the help
of my lovely assistant,

18:14.592 --> 18:16.493
I will perform
an amazing escape

18:16.494 --> 18:17.995
from the Jacket
of Doom.

18:22.433 --> 18:23.667
Huh.

18:23.668 --> 18:24.935
I thought we were
getting revenge.

18:24.936 --> 18:27.504
More like revenge on us,
having to watch.

18:29.140 --> 18:30.474
Ho-ho.

18:30.475 --> 18:32.376
And now for the master
to become the mark...

18:36.014 --> 18:38.682
This... isn't
going well...

18:38.683 --> 18:40.183
Aah!

18:40.184 --> 18:42.152
♪ Ta-dance.
Hah!

18:46.291 --> 18:47.958
And now, for the winner

18:47.959 --> 18:49.660
of the Young Magician's
Competition...

18:49.661 --> 18:51.461
The envelope, please!

18:51.462 --> 18:53.363
I can't believe you
got out of that thing.

18:53.364 --> 18:55.332
How'd you do it?
Magic.

18:55.333 --> 18:56.733
Would you mind

18:56.734 --> 18:58.335
popping my shoulder back in?
Yeah, sure.

18:58.369 --> 18:59.870
Thank you.

18:59.871 --> 19:01.672
Now, that's what
I call air mail!

19:02.907 --> 19:04.908
The $500 grand prize goes to...

19:04.909 --> 19:08.312
Peter Pescadero,
the Impescadaralist!

19:12.850 --> 19:14.151
I can't turn it off!

19:14.152 --> 19:15.352
Thank you!

19:15.386 --> 19:17.254
And the Honorable Mention Award

19:17.255 --> 19:19.389
for On-Stage Chemistry
goes to...

19:19.390 --> 19:22.492
Tina Belcher and
Jimmy Pesto Junior!

19:22.527 --> 19:23.493
Go, Tina!

19:23.528 --> 19:24.761
What?!

19:24.762 --> 19:26.229
"On Stage Chemistry"?

19:26.230 --> 19:27.764
That's almost as good
as off-stage chemistry.

19:27.765 --> 19:29.566
Why don't you two nerds
go have wizard babies?

19:29.567 --> 19:30.834
Enjoy your prize.

19:30.835 --> 19:32.235
A $50 gift
certificate from

19:32.236 --> 19:34.504
Wands! Wands! Wands!
magic shop.

19:34.505 --> 19:36.173
Can not be applied to
the purchase of wands.

19:36.207 --> 19:37.574
Sweet. Thanks, Tina.

19:37.575 --> 19:40.444
Don't thank me,
thank my lips.

19:40.445 --> 19:41.845
Thanks, lips!

19:41.879 --> 19:43.046
See ya!

19:44.349 --> 19:46.283
Now I see him, now I don't.

19:46.284 --> 19:48.385
Way to go, Tina!
Your trick was the best!

19:48.386 --> 19:49.720
Everyone was
talking about it.

19:49.754 --> 19:51.688
Thanks, Mom.
Cool if we don't hug?

19:51.723 --> 19:53.890
So you won
the Honorable Mention

19:53.891 --> 19:55.392
Onstage Chemistry award.

19:55.393 --> 19:56.627
That's something, right?

19:56.628 --> 19:58.028
No, I've thought
about it

19:58.029 --> 19:59.262
and I don't think
it is anything.

19:59.263 --> 20:00.530
Meanwhile,

20:00.531 --> 20:02.032
I picked my first pocket.

20:02.033 --> 20:03.567
Sazerac's.

20:03.568 --> 20:05.535
Oh, the "Enemies
of Magic" book.

20:05.570 --> 20:07.437
Thanks, Louise,
but I already tore my name out

20:07.438 --> 20:08.972
and look what I put in.

20:08.973 --> 20:10.407
Wait, what is this?

20:10.408 --> 20:12.976
"Look on the back of
the page you tore out."

20:14.779 --> 20:17.981
"Dear Bob, I knew this
is how it would end...

20:17.982 --> 20:19.816
<i>"...you sneaking
into my dressing room,</i>

20:19.817 --> 20:21.318
<i>"licking my cold-cuts,</i>

20:21.319 --> 20:22.986
<i>"and ripping your name
out of the book,</i>

20:22.987 --> 20:24.821
<i>which I then let Louise
take from my pocket."</i>

20:24.822 --> 20:26.390
He <i>let</i> me
take it?

20:26.391 --> 20:28.425
Wow.
That guy is good.

20:28.426 --> 20:30.127
Yeah, he's great!
There's a P.S.

20:30.128 --> 20:32.129
<i>"P.S. I farted on the meat."</i>

20:32.163 --> 20:34.231
Oh! Oh, God!

20:34.232 --> 20:36.733
Oh! Well, I hope you
learned your lesson, Bob.

20:36.734 --> 20:38.735
Don't lick meat.
Disagree.
