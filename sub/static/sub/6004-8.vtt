11:25.418 --> 11:27.752
[Gamora]
We're going to Hala?
The Kree Homeworld?

11:27.754 --> 11:29.587
That's not
what the map says.

11:29.589 --> 11:31.990
[beeps]

11:31.992 --> 11:35.960
I can't change the nav
coordinates. Someone's
got control of the ship.

11:35.962 --> 11:37.929
<i>[Quill, echoing]</i>

11:48.441 --> 11:49.941
[growling]

11:49.943 --> 11:52.810
Quill, we have
an intruder!

11:52.812 --> 11:55.680
[Gamora groaning]

11:55.682 --> 11:58.116
Groot, if you
jacked my tunes...

11:58.118 --> 12:01.452
<i>[Gamora echoing]</i>

12:17.469 --> 12:19.504
Holy pod people!

12:19.506 --> 12:21.806
Hang on! I'm gonna
get you out of here! Ah!

12:21.808 --> 12:23.875
[screams]

12:25.477 --> 12:27.578
[socket wrench ratcheting]

12:27.580 --> 12:29.580
I am Groot?

12:29.582 --> 12:32.817
There you are! Make
yourself useful and hold
this flashlight for me.

12:34.820 --> 12:37.655
Whoa! Somebody
changed our course.

12:37.657 --> 12:39.657
And then ripped out
the auxiliary controls.

12:39.659 --> 12:42.493
But... why?
I am--

12:42.495 --> 12:43.895
[Gamora]
Symbiote.
Rocket.

12:43.897 --> 12:47.031
Okay, that's new.
And creepy.

12:47.033 --> 12:49.233
<i>[Groot-Symbiote]</i>
<i>Very alone.</i>

12:49.235 --> 12:53.237
<i>[Symbiote speaking</i>

<i>Robots... must... yes!</i>

12:53.239 --> 12:57.608
Take it easy, big guy!
You still remember
your best bud Rocket!

12:57.610 --> 13:00.011
<i>[Symbiote imitating Rocket]</i>
<i>You're usually the one</i>
<i>messing up! Quit whining.</i>

13:00.013 --> 13:02.847
<i>Just gotta ruin</i>
<i>everything, don't ya?</i>

13:02.849 --> 13:05.716
<i>And don't try to play</i>
<i>the "last of my kind" card.</i>

13:05.718 --> 13:09.187
Heh-heh.
No... hard feelings?

13:09.189 --> 13:11.689
[Quill]
Rocket, run!

13:11.691 --> 13:13.758
Ah-ha-ha!
Ha-ha!

13:13.760 --> 13:15.693
[growling]

13:15.695 --> 13:18.262
[Rocket]
Wha'! Ugh. That ain't
gonna stop 'em for long!

13:18.264 --> 13:22.033
Where's Drax and Gammy?
Some kind of cocoon thing.
I mean, I think they're okay,

13:22.035 --> 13:23.968
but I can't get them out.

13:23.970 --> 13:26.871
So Groot's been taken over
by one of those kumbaya things?

13:26.873 --> 13:28.639
"Symbiote."
Said it wanted to grow,

13:28.641 --> 13:30.641
so it took over Groot
and hijacked the ship!

13:30.643 --> 13:33.711
Well, we're okay as long
as we steer clear of
any populated planets.

13:33.713 --> 13:38.649
Does 100 billion Kree
count as "populated"?
Ah! Yes.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.351
[Rocket]
Quick! In here!
[screaming]

13:44.723 --> 13:47.158
A little big ship welding
should buy us some time.

13:48.760 --> 13:50.628
We got to warn
the Kree Homeworld.

13:50.630 --> 13:52.263
Maybe they can keep
the ship from landing.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.298
You know, without
killing us.

13:54.300 --> 13:58.302
Nah, Groot ripped out
the comm when he tore up
the auxiliary controls.

13:58.304 --> 14:00.304
What we need
is a weapon.

14:00.306 --> 14:02.573
[Quill]
Yes! Another
music-blaster thing.

14:02.575 --> 14:04.175
Only way more powerful!

14:06.245 --> 14:08.746
Wait.<i> You</i> took
my tape player?

14:08.748 --> 14:11.649
[Rocket] Groot may love
your tunes, but they give
me a splittin' headache.

14:11.651 --> 14:13.985
But remember back in the mine?

14:13.987 --> 14:15.987
Won't cranking them to 11
do worse to Groot?

14:15.989 --> 14:18.923
I can't think about that now.

14:18.925 --> 14:20.324
[banging]

14:23.128 --> 14:24.762
I had the door reinforced
for smuggling.

14:24.764 --> 14:25.997
No way he's getting in.

14:25.999 --> 14:28.599
We are not a servant.

14:28.601 --> 14:31.669
We will not "be useful"!
[Quill grunts, yells]

14:33.272 --> 14:35.706
Wow, this guy learns fast!

14:35.708 --> 14:40.611
We will no longer be
"the last of our kind."

14:40.613 --> 14:43.114
With the power
of the Cosmic Seed,

14:43.116 --> 14:46.684
We will spread our kind
throughout the universe!

14:47.986 --> 14:49.820
Don't make me do this, bud.

14:49.822 --> 14:53.958
If you're still in there,
please don't make me do this!

14:53.960 --> 14:56.060
Okay, wait! Which kind
are we talking?

14:56.062 --> 14:58.963
The trees or the goop?
'Cause now I'm really confused.

14:58.965 --> 15:01.832
Don't matter, Quill.
'Cause the only thing
I'm spreadin'...

15:01.834 --> 15:03.201
is pain!

15:06.905 --> 15:10.408
[moaning]

15:13.745 --> 15:17.715
Ha-ha! I knew you could
do it, buddy!

15:17.717 --> 15:21.152
You're tougher than
any d'ast Symbiote!

15:21.154 --> 15:25.389
Mmm. I am Groot.

15:25.391 --> 15:27.758
No-o!

15:30.229 --> 15:34.098
No! Uh, there's
gotta be something!

15:34.100 --> 15:36.934
A twig. A splinter--
Anything!

15:36.936 --> 15:39.237
[crying]
He can't be gone!

15:39.239 --> 15:42.340
Rocket, I--
His arm.

15:42.342 --> 15:45.243
What about his arm?
[sniffing] What?

15:45.245 --> 15:47.345
The Symbiote
that took his arm.

15:47.347 --> 15:49.680
You sucked him up in
the storage dimension vial.

15:49.682 --> 15:52.383
If I go in and get Groot's arm,
you could regrow him from that!

15:52.385 --> 15:54.719
Yeah. Yeah!

15:54.721 --> 15:57.722
The big guy's grown back
before from a toothpick.

15:57.724 --> 16:00.124
But you ain't going.
I am.

16:00.126 --> 16:02.226
He's my best bud
and I did this to him.

16:02.228 --> 16:04.161
I gotta make it right.

16:06.098 --> 16:09.367
[whining]

16:09.369 --> 16:13.237
[humming]
I won't be able to communicate
while in the storage dimension.

16:13.239 --> 16:15.706
Let's synchronize watches.

16:15.708 --> 16:17.708
Okay, you've got
ten minutes.

16:17.710 --> 16:20.077
When that alarm goes off,
I open the vial
to let you out.

16:20.079 --> 16:23.447
On three.
One, two--

16:23.449 --> 16:25.750
Wait, should it be
"one, two, three go?"

16:25.752 --> 16:27.251
Or just like,
one two three?

16:27.253 --> 16:29.987
[angry]
Three!

16:48.807 --> 16:50.741
<i>[thinking]</i>
<i>Man, this is a lot of junk!</i>

16:50.743 --> 16:52.810
<i>They really got to do something</i>
<i>about that hoarding instinct.</i>

16:59.451 --> 17:03.854
All right, slimeballs.
Come get some!

17:03.856 --> 17:06.424
So! Which one of
you grease stains

17:06.425 --> 17:08.925
swiped my bud's arm, huh?

17:08.928 --> 17:11.494
Was it you?
Or was it you?

17:19.938 --> 17:22.106
And, back to
manual control.

17:22.108 --> 17:25.509
No Kree Homeworld
on today's menu.
[beeping]

17:25.511 --> 17:30.281
<i>Ho, ho. Now, you didn't</i>
<i>think you was gettin' away</i>
<i>that easy, did you, Boyo?</i>

17:37.489 --> 17:40.391
<i>Our Ravagers are currently</i>
<i>boarding your ship, so...</i>

17:40.393 --> 17:43.427
<i>if you could drop your weapon,</i>
<i>I'd greatly appreciate it.</i>

17:50.802 --> 17:56.006
Up till now,
I've been a kind and
patient father figure.

17:56.008 --> 17:58.809
But you betrayed my trust
once too often!

17:58.811 --> 18:01.312
I want that Cube, Quill. Now.

18:01.314 --> 18:04.782
I will do everything in my power
to make sure you never get it.

18:04.784 --> 18:09.153
Knock yourself out, Quill.
Or better yet, I will.

18:09.155 --> 18:10.421
Ugh!

18:11.823 --> 18:14.859
[squishing]

18:14.861 --> 18:17.528
Ohh... Uh!

18:17.530 --> 18:19.530
No one cocoons Drax.

18:19.532 --> 18:21.332
[groaning]

18:21.334 --> 18:25.469
Unh!
What took you so long?

18:26.872 --> 18:28.172
Running out of time here.

18:28.174 --> 18:30.241
Where is that d'ast arm?

18:32.944 --> 18:35.579
[roaring]

18:35.581 --> 18:38.416
There it is! Okay,
this situation

18:38.418 --> 18:41.419
calls for total,
surgical precision!

18:41.421 --> 18:43.521
Get ready to be dis-armed!

18:47.426 --> 18:49.927
[roaring]

18:51.563 --> 18:55.599
Huh! Sorry, chump,
that's my ride calling.

18:55.601 --> 18:57.535
Any time now.
[growls]

18:57.537 --> 18:59.003
Quill!

19:00.872 --> 19:05.075
Well, looky here.
A storage dimension vial.

19:05.077 --> 19:07.411
You think I wouldn't
find this, Boyo?

19:07.413 --> 19:10.281
You been hiding
swag in your boot
since you was a pup.

19:10.283 --> 19:14.051
Fellow in my line of work
could put this to good use.

19:14.053 --> 19:15.386
Now where's that Cube?

19:15.388 --> 19:17.621
Okay. I'll give you
the Cube.

19:17.623 --> 19:21.158
Just, whatever you do,
do not open that vial.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.395
I'm serious!
Hmm.

19:24.397 --> 19:26.931
You put it in here,
didn't you? Yeah.

19:26.933 --> 19:29.333
You can't hide
nothin' from me, boy.

19:29.335 --> 19:32.403
I can read you
like a book.

19:32.405 --> 19:34.505
A book I writ myself.

19:36.341 --> 19:38.576
Ahh!
Ohh!

19:38.578 --> 19:40.411
You keep your pet in there?

19:40.413 --> 19:43.581
Pet this, you toothless--
Huh?
[clanking]

19:45.417 --> 19:47.418
It's gonna blow!

19:48.920 --> 19:50.988
Aw, not again.

19:57.028 --> 19:58.963
I leave you alone
for ten minutes, Quill.

19:58.965 --> 19:59.997
And this
is what happens?

19:59.999 --> 20:02.099
That is so not fair!

20:02.101 --> 20:04.335
[screaming]

20:08.640 --> 20:10.241
Dude! Behind you!

20:11.276 --> 20:12.476
[groaning]

20:12.478 --> 20:14.545
It was kind of you
to warn them.

20:18.683 --> 20:21.051
[twittering, beeping]

20:23.054 --> 20:24.655
Hold on to your shorts!

20:24.657 --> 20:26.390
[engine roaring]
Holding.

20:27.392 --> 20:30.060
[alarm blasting]

20:36.535 --> 20:40.971
I'll get you, Quill!
I swear, I'll get you
for this one,

20:40.973 --> 20:42.973
boy!

20:42.975 --> 20:46.410
We still have the problem
of a Ravager ship
full of Symbiotes.

20:46.412 --> 20:51.148
Not necessarily. Remember
that wrench I gave Yondu?

20:51.150 --> 20:52.383
Yeah. Why?

20:52.385 --> 20:53.584
[clinks]

20:53.586 --> 20:55.653
[beeps]

21:00.592 --> 21:02.226
No reason.

21:04.329 --> 21:07.665
[Gamora]
Welcome back, Groot.
Don't
scare us like that again, okay?

21:07.667 --> 21:12.202
So... I know I've been treating
you kind of harsh lately.

21:12.204 --> 21:14.438
But all that angry,
taking-over-the-universe stuff,

21:14.440 --> 21:18.275
[laughs]
that was just a Symbiote
talking, right, buddy?

21:18.277 --> 21:21.178
I am Groot.

21:21.180 --> 21:25.015
Okay. I get it. I'll take
clean-up duty for this run.

21:25.017 --> 21:26.417
But you owe me!

21:29.220 --> 21:32.623
Gimme that. The rest o' youse,
keep your big yaps shut!

21:33.692 --> 21:35.693
No cheating
using the vial!
