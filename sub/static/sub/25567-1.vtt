A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:12.429 --> 00:14.597
[woman] Let me see that one.

00:15.015 --> 00:18.226
[woman] No, she'll end up
looking like a psychedelic fish.

00:18.309 --> 00:20.895
[woman] Let me see that other one there.

00:21.438 --> 00:24.149
[woman] Know what I'm going to do?
Not sure.

00:24.232 --> 00:26.776
[woman] I think I'll just take this one,
look.

00:26.860 --> 00:29.195
This one is perfect!

00:29.279 --> 00:30.196
No!

00:33.033 --> 00:34.993
Quick. Quick.

00:35.076 --> 00:37.954
Look at this one. [laughing]

00:38.038 --> 00:40.874
Beautiful, isn't it? Shines just like you.

00:40.957 --> 00:43.293
This is not my tiara.

00:43.376 --> 00:47.630
Samantha, the show is about to start.
Everyone is waiting for you on stage.

00:49.382 --> 00:52.135
It only starts when I arrive.

00:53.762 --> 00:55.638
[Samantha] Idiot. Out!

00:55.847 --> 00:58.641

01:05.397 --> 01:07.067
[Samantha] I want my tiara, now!

01:07.150 --> 01:10.070
-You look like a princess.
-And you look like an alien.

01:10.403 --> 01:11.738
[loudspeaker] <i>Dancers, please.</i>

01:11.821 --> 01:13.907
[grunts] Can someone shut up this woman?

01:13.990 --> 01:15.700
[moaning]

01:15.784 --> 01:18.369
[Samantha] That's all I needed.
Have you seen my tiara?

01:18.703 --> 01:20.121
Go away!

01:20.205 --> 01:22.415
[bell rings]

01:24.542 --> 01:26.211

01:28.213 --> 01:29.547
[Samantha] You again?

01:31.925 --> 01:34.010
I'm not a mushroom. I'm a human.

01:34.093 --> 01:35.595
[Samantha] You are weak!

01:40.642 --> 01:42.060
[Samantha] Where's my tiara?

01:44.646 --> 01:46.689
-Out, you witch.
<i>-</i> [loudspeaker] <i>Samantha, now!</i>

-Samantha, here! It's time!
-[Samantha] Have you seen my tiara?

01:51.903 --> 01:54.781
[Samantha] I'm not going on without it.
It's my favorite one!

01:54.864 --> 01:56.241
[producer] See you out there.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.201
[loudspeaker] <i>One minute.</i>

01:59.744 --> 02:01.037

-[Samantha] You've gained weight?

02:03.748 --> 02:07.001
[boy] Samonster, check out my tiara!

02:07.252 --> 02:09.336
[Samantha] Idiot, I knew it was you.

02:10.255 --> 02:12.841
-[Samantha] Give it back.
-Give me that!

02:13.299 --> 02:15.135
-[Samantha laughs]
-I hate you.

02:19.806 --> 02:20.974
[vomits]

02:28.273 --> 02:30.441
-Princess.
-[Samantha] Hey, Cig.

02:30.525 --> 02:31.943
Princess.

02:34.320 --> 02:38.408
They don't understand, Cig.
Everybody loves this tiara.

02:38.491 --> 02:40.201
[Ciggy] This is your show, princess.

02:40.285 --> 02:43.663
You are Brazil's most beloved child.

02:43.955 --> 02:47.959
-[Ciggy] Here!
-[woman] No is no. That's it. Excitement.

02:48.042 --> 02:50.295
[woman] Position, Cig.

02:51.629 --> 02:52.797

03:03.266 --> 03:06.185
What matters is to never stop believing!

03:06.269 --> 03:07.854
[music plays]

03:07.937 --> 03:09.772
Has anyone here seen an UFO?

03:09.856 --> 03:11.649
Yeah! We saw it together, remember?

03:11.733 --> 03:12.734
Of course I do!

05:25.658 --> 05:26.993
It's over, Samantha.

05:27.076 --> 05:28.286
Who are we trying to fool?

05:28.619 --> 05:32.832
Here, take your pay check and get lost.
I'm not your agent anymore, OK?

05:32.915 --> 05:36.252
Who are you working with, Marcinho?
That redneck with a moustache?

05:36.335 --> 05:38.296
It's called peach fuzz. And she's viral.

05:38.379 --> 05:41.799
Scored over a million views with a video!
You don't know what viral means.

05:41.883 --> 05:43.843
-I'm a cultural heritage.
-Ruined.

05:44.135 --> 05:46.304
You'll regret this. Mark my words.

05:46.387 --> 05:48.389
[Marcinho] If you were younger, I'd help.

05:48.473 --> 05:50.099
Put you naked on a magazine,

05:50.183 --> 05:52.602
marry you with some famous gay
from TV, but...

05:52.685 --> 05:54.771
[Marcinho] Want some advice?
From a father?

05:54.854 --> 05:58.608
Take the offer for that porn movie.
Before it's too late.

05:59.275 --> 06:01.652
Take a good look at my face, Marcinho.

06:02.236 --> 06:03.946
You will see me on television.

06:04.447 --> 06:05.740
You know what will happen?

06:06.866 --> 06:09.327
You will crawl, begging me to come back.

06:09.410 --> 06:12.622
You have a fucking star on your head
and you're threatening me?

06:13.414 --> 06:16.667
It'd be easier to change my name to Joelma
than ask you to come back.

06:18.127 --> 06:19.837
See you soon, Joelma.

06:24.258 --> 06:27.053
My bad, Paulão.
It's all going to Save the Bees.

06:27.136 --> 06:29.597
He doesn't deserve you!
He has someone else.

06:29.680 --> 06:31.015
Are you seeing it on my hand?

06:31.099 --> 06:33.559
No, but everyone here
has been gossiping about it.

06:33.643 --> 06:35.561
Let's go, kids! It's over.

06:37.313 --> 06:38.981
Cindy, cape.

06:39.398 --> 06:42.068
Brandon, boot. And the other one.

06:42.151 --> 06:43.319
Tiara?

06:45.279 --> 06:47.448
Got the sneakers? Where are they?

06:49.158 --> 06:50.451
[Samantha] I want to go now.

06:51.369 --> 06:52.954
Come on. Let's go.

06:53.037 --> 06:54.497
[male] Help me, kids!

06:54.580 --> 06:57.333
-[Ciggy] Help me get this off!
-[Cindy] It's stuck.

07:00.461 --> 07:02.547
Everyone gets a parking ticket here.

07:02.630 --> 07:03.881
Are you working here now?

07:03.965 --> 07:06.551
No, I already told your co-worker
this is a TV costume.

07:06.634 --> 07:08.302
Get out... Samantha?

07:08.386 --> 07:09.720
Since I was five.

07:09.804 --> 07:12.557
I can't believe this.
My mother was crazy about you.

07:12.640 --> 07:15.309
She named me after you,
but I'm Symantha with a Y.

07:15.393 --> 07:17.103
[laughing] How cool.

07:17.186 --> 07:20.022
But if you'll excuse me,
I'm leaving work, you know?

07:20.106 --> 07:21.607
You're working! That's great.

07:21.691 --> 07:25.153
It's tough out here. The Internet, apps.
Streets are dead.

07:25.903 --> 07:28.072
-Can you take a photo with me?
-Of course.

07:31.492 --> 07:32.743
[shutter clicks]

07:32.827 --> 07:35.621
Let's see. I've one eye that opens
less than the other one.

07:36.831 --> 07:39.208
-[hooker sighs]
-You don't look good?

07:39.292 --> 07:41.252
Me, no, I look great.

07:41.335 --> 07:42.837
[shouting]

07:42.920 --> 07:46.424
Who's the dirty old man
who farted in here?

07:46.507 --> 07:48.426
[laughing]

07:48.926 --> 07:49.844
Samantha?

07:49.927 --> 07:50.928
[together] Yes?

07:51.012 --> 07:54.390
He is speaking to me. Excuse me now.
Nice to meet you.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.683
-Bye!
-Bye!

07:55.933 --> 07:57.477
[sighs] Samantha...

07:57.560 --> 07:59.437
we've been through worse.

07:59.645 --> 08:02.690
-Remember that reality show?
-It was the ostrich's fault, Cig.

08:02.773 --> 08:05.318
[laughing] I know, princess.

08:06.152 --> 08:07.278
Oh...

08:07.987 --> 08:10.198
It's going to be all right, OK?

08:12.283 --> 08:13.451
[he kisses]

08:16.412 --> 08:17.538
Let's go, children!

08:17.622 --> 08:18.789
Let's go!

08:19.290 --> 08:22.627
-[computer game beeps]
-[children laugh]

08:23.794 --> 08:25.546
-[Brandon] That's so funny.
-Brandon.

08:25.630 --> 08:26.839
-Take this.
-[Brandon] OK.

08:26.923 --> 08:28.591
[whispering] Thank you.

08:31.302 --> 08:33.304
-There's something wrong here.
-What?

08:34.096 --> 08:36.307
[Samantha] What's going on?
Kids, lock the doors!

08:36.390 --> 08:38.183
-Lock the doors! Lock them.
-Mom?

08:38.476 --> 08:40.937
-[Samantha] Dodoi?
-[Cindy] Dad?

08:41.020 --> 08:42.730
[people shouting]

08:42.813 --> 08:44.607
[shouting]

08:46.317 --> 08:48.694
Brandon, I'm here. I'm here! Hold my hand.

08:50.655 --> 08:52.073
What the hell?

08:52.823 --> 08:54.158
[Samantha] Son, stay calm.

08:54.242 --> 08:55.409
[kids scream]

08:55.493 --> 08:59.330
It's over, calm down.
Let's get out of the car. Come on.

08:59.789 --> 09:00.998
[door opens]

09:03.042 --> 09:05.002
No! Turn it off! They'll see me.

09:05.753 --> 09:07.255
What are you doing here?

09:07.338 --> 09:08.714
Dad!

09:09.340 --> 09:11.425
-I'm out!
-Did you escape from prison?

09:11.509 --> 09:13.135
-Will we be arrested?
-Calm down.

09:13.219 --> 09:14.220
I'm free!

09:14.303 --> 09:16.138
[Samantha] What do you mean free?

09:16.222 --> 09:17.682
It's been 12 years, Samantha!

09:17.765 --> 09:21.060
-There's a guy climbing on the car!
-It's because Dad is famous.

09:21.143 --> 09:23.396
No, it's just that Brazilians
have a short memory.

09:23.479 --> 09:25.022
[Brandon] He's getting naked!

09:25.106 --> 09:27.149
He tattooed Dad's face on his butt!

09:27.233 --> 09:28.734
These people are insane.

09:29.110 --> 09:31.487
There's a pregnant man
saying the baby is mine!

09:31.571 --> 09:33.864
I was in prison,
how could I get someone pregnant?

09:35.491 --> 09:37.910
Kids, you're going to bed early today, OK?

09:37.994 --> 09:40.121
I need to have a little chat
with your dad.

09:40.204 --> 09:43.749
-But it's still midnight.
-We can make an exception. Go on.

09:43.833 --> 09:45.293
Give Dad a kiss.

09:45.751 --> 09:46.919
[kissing]

09:48.462 --> 09:50.423
[Dodoi] And you, come here.

09:53.134 --> 09:54.468
Aren't you happy to see me?

09:54.552 --> 09:57.680
I was last happy to see you
when you signed the divorce papers.

09:59.056 --> 10:03.227
Take it, my love.
And stop crying, for Christ's sake.

10:03.311 --> 10:04.812
[baby cries]

10:05.563 --> 10:08.065
[Cindy] Mommy, is Daddy
coming to live with us?

10:08.149 --> 10:10.359
No. Daddy is spending Christmas with us.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.111
We came to surprise him.

10:12.194 --> 10:14.447
Is he a gift from Santa?

10:14.530 --> 10:16.574
No, baby. Santa Claus isn't real.

10:16.657 --> 10:17.908
Look, look...

10:18.409 --> 10:20.244
[gate opens]

10:21.495 --> 10:23.122
[Samantha] Now. It's Daddy!

10:23.205 --> 10:25.458
[tires screech]

10:25.541 --> 10:28.127
[Dodoi laughs]

10:28.210 --> 10:30.963
[Dodoi] Here we go, let's drink!

10:32.548 --> 10:33.716
[baby screams]

10:33.799 --> 10:36.927
-I didn't see you, I told you.
-[Samantha] Yeah, right.

10:37.011 --> 10:39.221
-I have changed.
-Say it to your pals.

10:39.305 --> 10:42.058
It was the drink. I quit drinking.

10:42.141 --> 10:43.434
That thing is evil.

10:43.517 --> 10:45.519
I married you while you were in prison.

10:45.603 --> 10:48.481
We had two kids when your life was a mess.

10:48.564 --> 10:50.775
I stood by your side
when no one else wanted to.

10:51.942 --> 10:54.487
[people shouting outside]

10:56.906 --> 11:00.201
Mom, the samba school is outside!
Can I go out and dance?

11:00.284 --> 11:01.452
Go to bed, Brandon!

11:02.662 --> 11:04.080
Go to Rio, Dodoi.

11:04.163 --> 11:07.625
-Look at your pals partying outside.
-I don't want that, Samantha.

11:07.708 --> 11:11.545
I was thinking about buying a ranch
in a place that no one knows us.

Good evening, people.

12:06.392 --> 12:09.061
-Everybody from the press, OK?
-Where is Dodoi?

12:09.145 --> 12:11.897

He sent me to speak to you.

I'm more of an intellectual type.
I'm writing my autobiography.

17:28.422 --> 17:29.631
[Dodoi] Right.

17:31.467 --> 17:34.678
it must be hard for you
to live here alone with two women.

17:34.762 --> 17:35.846
I get along with women.

17:35.929 --> 17:37.473
Just like your daddy!

But now you have a buddy here, right?

Everything you can't tell your mom,
you can tell me.

I tell Mom everything.

17:43.687 --> 17:47.107
Yes, but I'm here

Everything's great!
I've made you a great breakfast.

I have to go to school.

-Just so you know, I'm vegan.
-Didn't your mom raise you as a Catholic?

18:17.429 --> 18:20.015
No, vegans don't eat anything
from animals.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.683
But all food comes from animals.

18:22.059 --> 18:25.896
That's delicious!
What did you put in here? Lemongrass?

I don't know, maybe we could do
something more...

I also know what's best for my kids.

-I'm good at men's stuff.
-Men's stuff?

19:13.318 --> 19:15.654
Now you'll hear about
how the world has changed.

19:15.737 --> 19:17.406
-Dad, the world's changed.
-See?

19:17.489 --> 19:19.741
And there's a kind of man
that is endangered.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.285
-Like rhinos.
-[Cindy] Exactly.

19:21.368 --> 19:24.496
Did you know there are only
2,000 rhinos left in the world?

19:24.580 --> 19:26.206
You don't want to be a rhino, Dad?

19:26.290 --> 19:27.207
No...

24:36.057 --> 24:37.893
[Dodoi] So you have keys, Cig?

24:40.729 --> 24:41.938
Who's there?

24:42.522 --> 24:43.481
Is it a spirit?

24:43.815 --> 24:45.108
[Dodoi] A spirit, Cig?

24:46.067 --> 24:47.986
Fofão? [laughing]

24:48.069 --> 24:49.279
Is it you?

24:49.571 --> 24:51.072
Are you trying to make contact?

24:51.156 --> 24:53.533
-Hold on, I'll write it down.
-[Dodoi] It's Dodoi.

24:53.617 --> 24:55.452
Oh! You scared me!

24:55.535 --> 24:56.995
[laughing]

24:57.078 --> 24:59.873
I thought it was a friend.

24:59.956 --> 25:01.291
[laughing]

25:03.001 --> 25:04.920
You've been with her a long time, right?

25:05.462 --> 25:09.174
I've been her friend since the time
it was cool to be a cigarette.

25:09.257 --> 25:10.217
[laughing]

25:10.675 --> 25:12.177
[Ciggy] It's been a while...

25:14.262 --> 25:16.389
Is she giving you much trouble?

25:17.599 --> 25:19.601
I was away too long, Cig.

25:19.684 --> 25:21.603
It's hard to understand what she wants.

25:21.686 --> 25:23.730
I'm here now.
I'll help to leave this life.

25:24.314 --> 25:25.690
Leave this life?

25:26.149 --> 25:28.360
You still don't understand.

25:28.902 --> 25:30.445
[Ciggy laughs]

25:30.528 --> 25:32.822
[coughing]

25:32.906 --> 25:34.324
[Dodoi] Are you OK, man?

25:34.407 --> 25:38.119
[coughing] I'm just tired. And old.

25:38.620 --> 25:40.622
You've done it all, haven't you?

25:40.705 --> 25:43.625
[Ciggy] No!
I've got a lot of things left to do.

25:43.708 --> 25:47.587
I still have to rob a bank with a toy gun,

25:47.671 --> 25:50.674
because... who hasn't done it
with a real gun?

25:50.924 --> 25:53.385
Parachuting without an instructor...

25:53.927 --> 25:55.887
I have to make love to a man...

25:56.763 --> 25:57.847
What's the matter?

25:58.181 --> 26:01.810
Don't trust what people say,
sex with men is not so cool, Cig.

26:01.893 --> 26:03.311
[Ciggy laughs]

26:03.395 --> 26:05.855
A dancer was hitting on me today.

26:06.273 --> 26:07.607
You know what he told me?

26:08.316 --> 26:10.110
He told me he was "fluid".

26:10.193 --> 26:11.903
[chuckles] That's it, Cig.

26:11.987 --> 26:15.573
If I learned anything in prison, it's that
we have to do what makes us happy.

26:15.782 --> 26:16.950
[Dodoi] Go for it.

26:18.952 --> 26:20.328
[Samantha] <i>So many signatures!</i>

26:21.121 --> 26:23.164
Too many, Joelma!

26:23.248 --> 26:26.126
It was a little more expensive
than I had in mind,

26:26.209 --> 26:27.627
but it's good news.

26:28.837 --> 26:31.256
-[Samantha] Let me see!
-Ready? I'll show it to you!

26:33.049 --> 26:34.175
Ta-daa!

26:34.259 --> 26:36.303
"Big handbags are coming back
into fashion"?

26:37.220 --> 26:38.638
Here, on the footnote.

26:38.722 --> 26:40.890
The human eye goes
straight to the footnote.

26:40.974 --> 26:43.268
-[Samantha] What's this?
-[Marcinho] Your interview! This tiny thing? It's not even a page!

26:45.729 --> 26:48.356
I spent hours telling my intimate stuff
to that woman.

26:48.773 --> 26:52.819
And look at this! My name is misspelled.
I told her my name's not Samantha anymore.

26:52.902 --> 26:54.279
-Not Samantha anymore?
-No.

26:54.362 --> 26:56.906
It's Samantha!
With an exclamation point at the end.

26:56.990 --> 26:58.158
-Repeat it.
-Samantha.

26:58.241 --> 26:59.451
No, Samantha!

26:59.534 --> 27:01.369
"Samanthá", emphasis on the last "A".

27:01.453 --> 27:03.079
-Samanthá.
-Listen, you'll see.

27:03.163 --> 27:04.622
-Samantha!
-Samantha.

27:04.706 --> 27:06.374
-Samantha!
-Like an exclamation.

27:06.458 --> 27:08.084
-Samantha!
-Samantha!

27:08.168 --> 27:09.002
Samantha!

27:09.085 --> 27:10.545
-Samantha.
-Samantha!

27:10.628 --> 27:11.463
Samantha.

27:11.546 --> 27:13.798
"Samantha!
There's a huge line for your show."

27:13.882 --> 27:15.550
"Samantha! Your car's outside."

27:15.633 --> 27:18.053
"Samantha! Ivete went home crying."
Try it!

27:18.386 --> 27:21.973
-Ivete never goes home crying.
-You wouldn't know!

27:34.027 --> 27:35.612
[Samantha] <i>Dodoi! I'll kill you!</i>

27:35.987 --> 27:38.448
[Samantha] That's what happens
when you help someone.

27:38.531 --> 27:41.910
What happens is that you get stabbed
in the back in your own house.

27:41.993 --> 27:43.703
I want to know what this is!

27:43.787 --> 27:45.872
"Big handbags back in fashion"?

27:46.623 --> 27:49.793
No, Dodoi! I'm talking about this.
What is this?

27:49.876 --> 27:51.878
EX-SOCCER PLAYER DODOI INVADED PITCH

27:51.961 --> 27:53.254
An article about you?

27:53.338 --> 27:58.134
My interview is only this tiny piece
which you need a telescope to read.

27:58.218 --> 28:00.011
This whole page. What is this, Dodoi?

28:00.595 --> 28:02.013
I can't even see it.

28:02.097 --> 28:04.766
-You can't? Brandon?
-I don't have my glasses.

28:04.849 --> 28:06.726
Cindy, the picture is pretty big.

28:06.810 --> 28:08.228
Is it a soccer pitch?

28:08.311 --> 28:10.855
Suddenly everyone's nearsighted here.

28:10.939 --> 28:12.649
It's OK, I'll read it to you.

28:12.732 --> 28:17.570
[Samantha] "Former soccer star Dodoi
invaded Pacaembu Stadium,

28:17.654 --> 28:20.615
played soccer with his kids,
did some ball-bouncing,

28:20.698 --> 28:22.617
and took photos with fans."

28:22.700 --> 28:24.994
Can I die now? With so much cuteness?

28:25.078 --> 28:27.872
Is that why my photo came out so small
in the footnote?

28:27.956 --> 28:30.041
Samantha, I didn't see any photographers.

28:30.125 --> 28:33.545
You were supposed to take the kids
to school. Look how my son is!

28:33.628 --> 28:35.130
But I'm great!

28:35.213 --> 28:37.382
So that's what you came back for?

28:37.674 --> 28:39.300
To mess up my life?

28:39.384 --> 28:42.011
Because if so,
you should have stayed in prison.

28:57.277 --> 29:01.197
[Samantha] Put me down gently, OK?
Careful with your Cindy...

29:02.073 --> 29:06.369
<i>It doesn't matter that this place isn't</i>
<i>normal. Our lives aren't normal anyway.</i>

29:06.703 --> 29:09.581
[chuckling] She's going to be so pretty.

29:10.039 --> 29:11.875
Just like her mom...

29:16.755 --> 29:17.672
What's this?

29:18.006 --> 29:20.633
The key to our home
for when you leave here.

29:44.157 --> 29:45.492
[door opens]

29:50.038 --> 29:54.000
This is a really important night for me,
and I need my family with me.

30:05.053 --> 30:06.679
I didn't mean to say that, OK?

30:06.971 --> 30:09.766
Of course it wouldn't be better
if you'd stayed in prison.

30:10.850 --> 30:13.937
Hey... I didn't even
have to fire the old guy!

30:14.020 --> 30:16.564
It couldn't be better than this
if we tried.

30:16.648 --> 30:18.483
What are you talking about?

30:19.317 --> 30:22.278
[Ciggy] No, I was waiting
for you to ask me out.

30:22.362 --> 30:23.822
I wanted to know if you have...

30:24.823 --> 30:27.784
-[Ciggy] Stop it!
-[Samantha] That's all I needed now!

30:28.159 --> 30:30.245
Leave me, Samantha! I'm old.

30:30.328 --> 30:32.831
Stop this nonsense!
It's always been like this.

30:33.164 --> 30:35.375
Who's going to help me
if I forget the lyrics?

30:35.458 --> 30:36.584
Look at me.

30:38.044 --> 30:40.338
Get on this stage and help me shine.

30:40.421 --> 30:43.633
Marcinho is right.
Who is going to need a stinky old man?

30:43.716 --> 30:45.510
Cig! This is just the beginning.

30:45.593 --> 30:49.222
We'll make a comeback,
you and me together, on television.

30:49.305 --> 30:52.725
Samantha... television is dead!

[Ciggy] Dodoi, come here!

31:13.997 --> 31:15.039
It happened!

31:16.040 --> 31:17.083
Did you rob a bank?

31:17.166 --> 31:19.127
His name is Wilson, silly!

31:19.586 --> 31:22.255
-The dancer?
-Yeah, him and two others!

31:22.338 --> 31:24.883
But what they did, man,
first they grabbed me...

31:24.966 --> 31:27.719
All right, Cig. I'm glad for you!

31:27.802 --> 31:28.803
[Ciggy laughs]

31:28.887 --> 31:30.763
-I'll see how the kids are.
-OK.

31:32.056 --> 31:33.349

[Samantha] Cig?

32:08.927 --> 32:10.136
What's wrong, Cig?

32:10.553 --> 32:11.596
[Dodoi] Someone help!

32:11.679 --> 32:14.265
-[Samantha] Talk to me!
-[Marcinho] Come on, Samantha!

32:14.599 --> 32:15.642
Dodoi...

32:16.100 --> 32:17.644
[Marcinho] Now, for fuck's sake!

32:19.771 --> 32:21.773
Leave this old man behind, Samantha!

32:21.856 --> 32:24.192

32:24.275 --> 32:27.362
Do you know how much this costs?
I'll destroy your career!

32:29.572 --> 32:32.241
-Go! Call a doctor!
-[Dodoi] I need a phone.

32:32.325 --> 32:36.746
[Samantha] Call the doctor.
Cig? Talk to me, Cig.

32:43.002 --> 32:47.340
"If there is anyone reading this,
it is because I am dead.

32:49.300 --> 32:52.720
I don't have anything to say at my wake,
