WEBVTT

00:10.560 --> 00:15.280
[Carol] "And Babar with his arm around
Celeste's shoulder,

00:15.360 --> 00:18.240
Celeste with her head bowed,

00:18.320 --> 00:21.320
and the other elephant, Cornelius,

00:21.400 --> 00:24.520
giving to Babar power..."

00:24.600 --> 00:26.360
[man on television]
<i>She's my food idol, I had to--</i>

00:26.440 --> 00:28.040
[Audrey clicks tongue]
Can you come here for a sec?

00:28.120 --> 00:30.120
[man on television] <i> I couldn't wait</i>
<i>to see what was in that box.</i>

00:31.160 --> 00:34.000
<i>Oh, my god. It was not what I expected.</i>

00:34.760 --> 00:37.360
What? I was just about to find out
what the mystery box was.

00:37.440 --> 00:39.560
Yeah, your mum's reading Stevie <i> Babar.</i>

00:39.640 --> 00:41.880
So? That's my old book.

00:42.680 --> 00:44.520
OK, everyone knows Babar's a dictator

00:44.600 --> 00:46.760
and the whole thing's an allegory
for French colonialism.

00:46.840 --> 00:48.720
It's imperialist propaganda.

00:48.800 --> 00:51.240
Rich old lady domesticates savage beast.

00:51.320 --> 00:54.120
Can we not turn story time
into a political act?

00:54.200 --> 00:58.040
And you're not going to start
defacing books like Verity, are ya?

00:58.120 --> 01:00.200
Damn right I'll change the pronouns
from 'he' to 'she'!

01:00.280 --> 01:02.880
I'm not having Stevie grow up
thinking only boys have adventures.

01:02.960 --> 01:04.400
Fine, I'll go tell her to stop.

01:04.480 --> 01:07.400
Don't do that. Don't do that.
She'll know it was me.

01:07.480 --> 01:09.880
I just wish she would stop doing
the opposite of what I... -I left out a <i> Miffy.</i>
-What?

01:13.240 --> 01:14.760
The genderless rabbit books.

01:14.840 --> 01:16.520
Miffy's a she, Aud.

01:16.600 --> 01:17.840
Not in my house.

01:17.920 --> 01:20.200
And I cannot do anymore home mochas.

01:20.280 --> 01:23.120
OK, instant coffee and Milo, it's yuck!

01:23.200 --> 01:24.880
[Carol] Audrey?

01:24.960 --> 01:26.120
Home mocha?

01:26.200 --> 01:27.760
Ooh, yes, please. Thanks, Carol.

01:27.840 --> 01:30.000
[television plays indistinctly
in the background]

01:31.280 --> 01:32.320
Shut up.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
[theme music plays]

01:39.000 --> 01:42.640
[Carol] Jeremy gave me a shopping list.
Now, your pads.

01:42.720 --> 01:45.080
Jeremy said to get the biggest.

01:45.160 --> 01:49.840
Extra thick and extra wide,
with aloe vera.

01:49.920 --> 01:52.960
Oh, aloe vera. I wonder how that helps.

01:53.040 --> 01:55.840
Thanks. I just wanted some liners
in case I went back to yoga.

01:55.920 --> 01:57.440
But these are perfect. Thank you.

01:57.520 --> 01:59.960
And new razors too,

02:00.040 --> 02:02.600
if you're thinking about
de-fuzzing those legs.

02:04.200 --> 02:05.880
[mobile phone rings]

02:06.960 --> 02:07.960
Hi, Mum.

02:08.038 --> 02:09.160
[Verity] <i> Oh hi, darling.</i>

02:09.240 --> 02:11.480
How can you call? I thought
it was a monastic silence retreat.

02:11.560 --> 02:13.440
[Verity] <i> I'm hiding.</i>
<i>I've got the worst throat.</i>

02:13.520 --> 02:15.240
Oh, how can you possibly
have a sore throat?

02:15.320 --> 02:16.440
[Verity] <i> Now, what did you want?</i>

02:16.520 --> 02:18.920
Now, tomorrow night, are you coming
for Dad's anniversary?

02:19.000 --> 02:20.280
[Verity] <i> Who? Babs?</i>

02:20.360 --> 02:21.360
Stephen.

02:21.440 --> 02:22.640
[Verity] <i> What are we celebrating?</i>

02:22.720 --> 02:23.800
His death.

02:23.880 --> 02:24.880
[Verity] <i> I can't.</i>

02:24.960 --> 02:26.040
OK, well, just the pub, then?

02:26.120 --> 02:27.760
[Verity] <i> No, I'll reflect here.</i>
<i>More picturesque.</i>

02:27.840 --> 02:29.800
We're supposed to reflect together.

02:29.880 --> 02:31.640
[Verity] <i> Oh, Audrey.</i>
-How long are you there for?

02:31.720 --> 02:33.320
[Verity] <i> Ten days. If you want results.</i>

02:33.400 --> 02:35.360
-Yeah, alright. Hang on, no, I can't...
[Verity] <i> Oh, shit.</i>

02:35.440 --> 02:37.800
-Mum? Mum? Mum?
[Verity] <i> I've gotta go. Sprung. Sorry.</i>

02:37.880 --> 02:41.200
How's Mum? Oh, she's fun, isn't she?

02:41.280 --> 02:42.320
[chuckles] Yes.

02:43.240 --> 02:46.240
[Teddy cooing]

02:46.320 --> 02:48.240
[bicycle bell]
[Dave] Martha! Martha!

02:48.320 --> 02:49.320
-Dave?
[Dave] Hi!

02:49.400 --> 02:51.360
What... are you... What are you doing?

02:51.440 --> 02:53.280
I was just riding by and I saw you guys.

02:53.360 --> 02:55.240
Yeah, right. You live in Banksia.

02:55.320 --> 02:56.360
[panting] Yeah.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.920
Yeah, actually it's really handy
that I saw you because, um...

02:59.000 --> 03:02.960
I was going to drop round to your place
because Mum's been knitting.

03:03.040 --> 03:05.160
Dave, you cannot be doing...
Boy, that's really soft.

03:05.240 --> 03:06.400
Is that a garter stitch?

03:06.480 --> 03:07.680
No, it's a moss stitch.

03:08.720 --> 03:11.000
No, Dave, it's just not appropriate.

03:11.080 --> 03:12.120
-Really?
-No.

03:12.200 --> 03:14.480
I thought with this trans-seasonal
weather it was kind of perfect.

03:14.560 --> 03:16.720
Dave, it's not the cardigan. OK?

03:16.800 --> 03:18.840
It's your mother, knitting.

03:18.920 --> 03:20.760
And you just popping up everywhere

03:20.840 --> 03:22.400
and you're leaving food parcels
at my door.

03:22.480 --> 03:24.440
Did you get the pumpkin ravioli
with the burnt sage butter?

03:24.520 --> 03:26.000
Dave, it's... No.

03:26.080 --> 03:28.080
It is just not what we agreed to.

03:29.200 --> 03:30.920
-OK. Absolutely.
-OK?

03:31.000 --> 03:32.440
-OK.
-OK?

03:32.520 --> 03:34.200
-Quick cuddle before you--
-No!

03:35.400 --> 03:38.080
You're sweaty and I'm going to be late.

03:38.160 --> 03:39.520
[mumbles indistinctly]

03:39.600 --> 03:41.440
OK. Bye, Teddy Bear.

03:42.520 --> 03:43.600
Bye, Martha.

03:44.520 --> 03:46.760
The orchestra really misses you.

03:46.840 --> 03:48.520
Strings are rubbish without you.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.160
[sighs]

03:51.240 --> 03:53.640
[Teddy crying]

03:53.720 --> 03:57.280
Now, the level of support needed
will depend largely on rest.

03:57.360 --> 03:59.160
[chuckles] Rest? What is that?

03:59.240 --> 04:00.600
I think she's trying to be funny.

04:00.680 --> 04:02.080
You still driving at night?

04:02.160 --> 04:04.480
[Audrey] No. Well,
not while the in-laws are here.

04:04.560 --> 04:06.400
I'm just feeding five times a night.

04:06.480 --> 04:07.880
[Martha] Oh, Audrey.

04:08.680 --> 04:10.880
I just can't seem to settle him
at the moment.

04:10.960 --> 04:13.000
Well, it could be over-stimulation.

04:13.080 --> 04:14.440
-Really?
-He's very alert.

04:14.520 --> 04:15.520
[Teddy cooing] Hello.

04:16.680 --> 04:20.279
You might want to try what they now call
a 'boring them to sleep' technique.

04:20.360 --> 04:23.120
I could lend you my father-in-law
for that. Very boring.

04:23.200 --> 04:24.200
[scattered chuckles]

04:24.280 --> 04:28.320
Low lights, tight swaddle.
And make sure partner does a night shift.

04:28.400 --> 04:31.000
You need your rest too.
Men might seem useless--

04:31.080 --> 04:32.240
Uh, not in my house.

04:32.320 --> 04:34.240
...but they're perfectly capable.

04:34.320 --> 04:35.720
It's just me and Teddy.

04:35.800 --> 04:38.120
[Barbara] Where's your partner, love?
Work trips? Or in Bali surfing with the boys?
[chuckles]

04:40.600 --> 04:44.120
There's no he. Or she. It's just us.

04:44.200 --> 04:47.320
OK, do you have other support, then?
Paid, even?

04:47.400 --> 04:50.560
I will, once we get childcare sorted.

04:50.640 --> 04:55.560
And we've actually got another interview
this week, so fingers crossed.

04:55.640 --> 04:58.440
[Georgia] Well, make sure you look
really chaotic. Like, really fucked up.

04:58.520 --> 05:00.840
Yeah, she's right.
So, tears, vomit stains

05:00.920 --> 05:03.560
and if you could and try maybe sleep
in your make-up as well.

05:03.640 --> 05:06.880
Matted hair helps. Bit like...
[whistles] ...over here.

05:06.960 --> 05:07.960
Huh?

05:08.040 --> 05:09.760
Oh, do you have a childcare interview
today, Audrey?

05:09.840 --> 05:13.800
No. I've been sleeping on an air mattress
cause the in-laws are here.

05:13.880 --> 05:16.920
Oh, and I know it's a little on the nose,
but the single mum angle.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Wh... What?

05:18.080 --> 05:19.840
It's a very strong narrative for you.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.760
[Barbara] Your partner didn't die, did he?

05:21.840 --> 05:23.000
No.

05:23.080 --> 05:24.680
You know, maybe he did die...

05:25.640 --> 05:26.640
in battle... [Martha sighs]

05:27.800 --> 05:29.200
...fighting for his country. It all helps.

05:29.280 --> 05:30.480
[Ruben] That's good.
[Barbara] Yeah.

05:30.560 --> 05:32.280
Just be vague about the whole thing.
It will help.

05:32.360 --> 05:33.440
It's needs-based.

05:33.520 --> 05:35.120
She doesn't have to manipulate the system.

05:35.200 --> 05:38.720
Alright, but, you know... eye drops,
Vicks under the nose. You'll be sweet.

05:38.800 --> 05:41.440
OK. Thank you, everyone. We're fine.

05:41.520 --> 05:44.520
[Teddy cries loudly]

05:44.600 --> 05:45.960
[relaxed music plays]

05:46.040 --> 05:47.600
[Carol] There she is.
-Hi.

05:48.600 --> 05:52.480
I was so worried, she must be exhausted.

05:52.560 --> 05:53.720
I'll put her down.

05:53.800 --> 05:56.400
Come on, my little bubba darling.

06:01.800 --> 06:03.240
[keys jingle]

06:03.320 --> 06:04.960
[Audrey sighs] [Gene mutters indistinctly]

06:12.200 --> 06:13.560
What are you up to, Gene?

06:14.760 --> 06:15.880
Ancestry.

06:15.960 --> 06:16.960
Oh, brilliant.

06:17.040 --> 06:18.840
I just got this email.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.520
It's from this butcher in Scotland.

06:20.600 --> 06:22.280
Now, he reckons that we're related

06:22.360 --> 06:27.880
through a paternal
great-great-great-great-uncle.

06:27.960 --> 06:29.720
Wow.

06:29.800 --> 06:30.800
Mmm.

06:31.960 --> 06:33.160
Cup of tea?

06:33.240 --> 06:36.680
-Oh, I'd rather have a home mocha.
-Home mocha. You bet.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.720
[Carol] I don't know what all the fuss
is about, Audrey.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.920
I popped her down on her tummy
and she's out like a light.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.880
Cousin Richard...
he's descended from Romanian gypsies.

06:46.960 --> 06:48.040
[Carol] Shocking!

06:48.120 --> 06:50.720
Oh, Margaret won't put that
on The Facebook.

06:50.800 --> 06:52.160
[Carol and Gene laugh] Mochas?

06:54.240 --> 06:57.200
Darling, I'll help you,
'cause there's such an art to it. Now...

06:58.040 --> 07:00.440
Hey, what time will you be home?
Please don't be late.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.480
[Jeremy] <i> What? Mum's there to help you.</i>

07:02.560 --> 07:04.880
[sniggers] Help or judge?

07:04.960 --> 07:07.840
Oh, come on. But Mum doesn't have
a judgey bone in her body.

07:07.920 --> 07:10.320
[Audrey] <i> Yeah, you have a curious</i>
<i>inability to read passive aggression.</i>

07:10.400 --> 07:11.680
Even mine.
[knocking]

07:11.760 --> 07:13.880
[Carol] Goodness me, that's a long feed.

07:13.960 --> 07:16.480
Yeah, she hates the left boob.

07:16.560 --> 07:19.680
[Carol] Oh, well, that's no good.
Make sure you even them out.

07:19.760 --> 07:22.440
And don't overfeed.
She'll only bring it back up.

07:22.520 --> 07:23.520
Thank you. [Audrey] <i> Hear that?</i>

07:24.680 --> 07:26.080
Um, no.
[phone ringing]

07:26.160 --> 07:28.880
Um, Aud, I'm sorry, I've got to go.
OK? Got a meeting.

07:28.960 --> 07:30.160
Don't be late. Be early.

07:30.240 --> 07:31.480
[Jeremy] <i> OK. Bye.</i>

07:31.560 --> 07:34.240
[Audrey sighs]
[Carol] Audrey? How are your nipples?

07:35.880 --> 07:37.000
Sorry, mate. Go ahead.

07:37.080 --> 07:40.040
<i>So, more money, more hours,</i>
<i>more time away from home,</i>

07:40.120 --> 07:41.320
<i>you can thank me later,</i>

07:41.400 --> 07:43.640
<i>and you'll be part</i>
<i>of the fucking revolution.</i>

07:43.720 --> 07:46.920
[chuckles] Amazing. So it's California?

07:47.000 --> 07:49.200
<i>Yeah, mate.</i><i> They're making</i>
<i>huge progress with it over here.</i>

07:49.280 --> 07:50.440
<i>Have you driven one?</i>

07:50.520 --> 07:51.880
Just an early prototype

07:51.960 --> 07:54.800
when I was still doing
my masters research, that was it.

07:54.880 --> 07:57.560
[Harry] <i> Silent. You think your car</i>
<i>is a refuge now?</i>

07:57.640 --> 07:59.680
<i>Wait until you get inside</i>
<i>one of these electric babies.</i>

07:59.760 --> 08:01.640
<i>I'm getting hard just thinking about it.</i>

08:01.720 --> 08:04.240
Well, I need to talk to Audrey
about it first.

08:04.320 --> 08:05.640
[Harry] <i> Buh! Wrong!</i>

08:05.720 --> 08:07.840
<i>You want to have that shit-fight</i>
<i>before you see the offer?</i>

08:07.920 --> 08:11.680
<i>You need to ease into this stuff.</i>
<i>Champagne, new handbag.</i>

08:11.760 --> 08:13.440
<i>I better go address this hard-on.</i>

08:13.520 --> 08:15.520
Yeah, go for it. Thanks.

08:15.600 --> 08:17.200
[Harry] <i> I'll get back to ya.</i>
[call ends]

08:17.280 --> 08:18.800
"Go for it"? Jesus.

08:21.480 --> 08:23.760
Well, it was important for me
to know the donor

08:23.840 --> 08:26.200
and Dave was an excellent candidate.

08:26.280 --> 08:29.960
-Thanks.
-He's a musician. He's smart. Good teeth.

08:30.040 --> 08:32.880
Oh, four years of braces. I'd hope so.
[Dave chuckles]

08:32.960 --> 08:35.600
Really? You didn't tell me
about the braces.

08:35.679 --> 08:38.840
Right. So, thanks for bringing these in,
Dave. That's fantastic.

08:38.919 --> 08:42.919
But it's clear that he wants to play
a very different role

08:43.000 --> 08:44.240
to what we agreed on.

08:45.120 --> 08:47.920
Since Teddy's birth,
there's been a lot of interference.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.040
Interference?

08:49.120 --> 08:50.840
OK. Tell me about that.

08:50.920 --> 08:54.920
Mmm, well, one day,
he left cake at my front door.

08:55.640 --> 08:56.640
It was her birthday.

08:56.720 --> 08:59.240
He comes around a lot, actually,
with food.

08:59.320 --> 09:01.640
Oh, really? Always cakes, or...

09:01.720 --> 09:03.000
More savoury, actually.

09:03.080 --> 09:05.560
I like to make my own fresh pasta,
so ravioli, gnocchi.

09:05.640 --> 09:07.520
-Mmm! Me too!
-Ah!

09:07.600 --> 09:09.720
What sort of potatoes do you use
in your gnocchi?

09:09.800 --> 09:10.920
Oh, good question.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.160
So, I use Yukon Gold,
but I also use Russet.

09:15.240 --> 09:16.320
[Martha clears her throat]

09:17.040 --> 09:18.320
-So...
-[whispers] Tell me after.

09:18.400 --> 09:23.440
...last Saturday, he came around
with 12 panels of acoustic foam.

09:23.520 --> 09:25.880
To soundproof your study,
so she can practise.

09:25.960 --> 09:28.360
His mother came to my house yesterday.

09:28.440 --> 09:29.880
-What?
-With that cardigan.

09:30.960 --> 09:33.120
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

09:34.080 --> 09:35.880
Oh, she's really struggling with this.

09:35.960 --> 09:37.440
She's desperate to meet him.

09:37.520 --> 09:41.000
"The donor agrees to forego
all rights and responsibilities

09:41.080 --> 09:44.320
in relation to any child,
including contact."

09:45.520 --> 09:48.720
I mean, don't make me
enforce this in court, Dave. That's not necessarily
what would happen, Martha.

09:53.320 --> 09:55.760
So, what? What? Pardon?

09:55.840 --> 09:59.400
Well, the court would decide
in the best interest of the child.

09:59.480 --> 10:02.520
And that may not be
what's written in your contract.

10:02.600 --> 10:05.800
So... it's not legally binding.

10:05.880 --> 10:09.000
I just feel like I could be
so much more than just sperm.

10:10.800 --> 10:12.960
I just wanted a baby.

10:14.040 --> 10:16.920
I didn't want a partner or another family.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.400
I've got my own fucked up one
that I manage to avoid...

10:19.480 --> 10:21.960
-OK, let's just keep the language--
-...quite successfully, actually.

10:22.040 --> 10:23.600
Don't you think he'll want to know
who his dad is?

10:23.680 --> 10:24.800
You're not his dad.

10:26.120 --> 10:27.840
You're his donor.

10:28.520 --> 10:29.960
OK, look...

10:30.040 --> 10:31.360
he's mine.

10:32.040 --> 10:33.160
-OK?
-Martha...

10:33.240 --> 10:34.840
Teddy is mine.

10:34.920 --> 10:38.280
Martha, come on. You're all alone.
I can just help.

10:39.480 --> 10:43.320
Well, I could teach him boy things,
like...

10:43.400 --> 10:45.480
like sports or Lego

10:45.560 --> 10:48.200
or how to clean his little penis.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
You have to peel the skin back
so it doesn't get infected.

10:56.840 --> 10:58.200
Another?

10:59.320 --> 11:01.160
After this. Come here.

11:02.400 --> 11:05.880
[chuckles] What are you doing?
I need to find out if she went to prison.

11:05.960 --> 11:08.760
Come on, Aud. It's been...
It's been a long time.

11:09.600 --> 11:11.840
Your parents are upstairs.

11:12.440 --> 11:15.720
Yeah, they're asleep,
and Mum has sleep apnoea.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.320
Well, don't mention your mother
with your hand down my pants!

11:18.400 --> 11:20.080
Eugh! I feel sick.

11:20.160 --> 11:21.280
[Jeremy] Thanks.

11:21.360 --> 11:22.800
We should probably go to bed.

11:22.880 --> 11:24.400
You go. I'll come up soon.

11:25.400 --> 11:26.720
Yep. Mm-hm.

Hi, Mum! Yep, just, um...

11:57.520 --> 12:00.840
if you could knock...
I'm watching this Iranian doco.

12:00.920 --> 12:02.120
It's fascinating.

12:03.920 --> 12:07.280
About a guy who goes to Tehran
for the first time.

12:09.840 --> 12:11.000
-Night night.
-OK.

around the cemetery.

12:20.920 --> 12:23.440
[Gene] What? What?
[Carol] Audrey's having another sleep-in.

12:23.520 --> 12:26.360
[Gene] She's getting more sleep
than all of us put together.

12:26.440 --> 12:28.480
[Carol] Well, you wouldn't know
by looking at her.

12:28.560 --> 12:30.320
She obviously needs a lot.

[Jimmy] He was a good man. He was.

12:35.920 --> 12:37.640
He would've loved that little one.

Feels like yesterday
he was just sitting there.

-Cheers.

Sure do.

Nah. One more.

13:16.320 --> 13:17.520
[young Audrey] OK, Dad.

13:18.640 --> 13:19.720

13:23.120 --> 13:25.520
It's, um... early, isn't it?

13:26.120 --> 13:28.960
Yeah, I'm... I'm having a beer.
[chuckles]

13:29.840 --> 13:31.720
Yeah, so, just a little ritual.

13:31.800 --> 13:33.000
Not usually at 9am.

13:33.080 --> 13:36.240

from the in-laws.

-Mmm!
-They think we're at mums and bubs yoga.

Oh. How is that going?
Not the yoga, the...

-Yeah.

Um, well, the place is immaculate.

13:47.040 --> 13:48.520
-Well, that's something.
-Yep. -And Jeremy's dad...
-Mmm?

13:50.960 --> 13:55.000
He is... um, completely disengaged.

13:55.080 --> 13:57.240
-Ah.
-Yeah, virtually silent.

13:57.320 --> 13:58.960
Polar opposite to mine.

13:59.040 --> 14:00.600
He does nothing.

14:00.680 --> 14:02.400
-Oh.
-Well, except family trees.

14:02.480 --> 14:05.840
-Oh, one of those people who does that.
-Yes. Yes, he is.

14:05.920 --> 14:07.360
Yeah, he wouldn't know where Jeremy works,

14:07.440 --> 14:10.120
but he could tell you where
his great-great-uncle did.

14:10.200 --> 14:13.160
[Martha laughs]
-Yes, he could. And he will.

14:13.240 --> 14:15.560
[both laugh]

14:18.880 --> 14:20.360
What was your dad like?

14:22.880 --> 14:25.320
I actually have a lot of memories of him
sitting right there.

14:26.720 --> 14:29.280
Yeah, he probably was an alcoholic.
High functioning.

14:30.120 --> 14:34.160
Um... he was a kind guy. He was...

14:36.080 --> 14:37.280
you know, adventurous.

14:38.080 --> 14:40.440
He was a very hands-on dad.
He, um...

14:40.520 --> 14:45.280
Yeah, Verity, my mum, had a bit of
an '80s feminist moment in the '90s,

14:45.360 --> 14:46.600
when I was in Year Six,

14:46.680 --> 14:48.960
and she took off to Turkey
for four months.

14:49.040 --> 14:50.400
-Oh!
-Yep.

14:50.480 --> 14:53.880
And Dad quit work, and, um...

14:54.600 --> 14:55.880
just looked after me.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.240
-Really?
-Yeah.

14:58.320 --> 14:59.600
Wow.

14:59.680 --> 15:01.080
Yep, we were good friends.

15:02.640 --> 15:03.640
Mmm.

15:03.720 --> 15:08.960
It's weird thinking she won't... know him.
Like, that's strange. [chuckles]

15:11.880 --> 15:13.840
[Martha sighs and clicks tongue]

15:13.920 --> 15:16.240

15:17.560 --> 15:18.880
Anyway, how are you?

[gentle music plays]

15:20.240 --> 15:21.760
Oh, I...

15:21.840 --> 15:24.440
Oh, there's just a little bit
of shit going down.

15:25.280 --> 15:27.720
It's... Excuse me, um...

15:27.800 --> 15:30.320
I will have one of those,
and do you want...

15:30.400 --> 15:31.600
Yeah, I'll get another.

15:32.680 --> 15:35.680

but this can't become a thing.

-You missed bath time.

You two are going out to dinner.

15:47.400 --> 15:49.640
-I'll do this.
-No, Mum it's a...

15:49.720 --> 15:52.400
Yeah, no, it's the anniversary
of Dad's death.

15:53.400 --> 15:56.600
Oh, well, that's not a very happy thing,
is it?

15:56.680 --> 15:58.120
Well, I thought you meant...

15:58.880 --> 16:00.880
It's very difficult
without a wedding date.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.120
Look, it doesn't bother me,

16:02.200 --> 16:04.640
but it could have consequences
for little Stevie.

16:05.640 --> 16:06.640
[sighs]

16:07.560 --> 16:11.680
Well, I guess you won't want to celebrate
a death anniversary, will you?

16:11.760 --> 16:12.760
I do.

16:12.840 --> 16:13.920
Yeah, I do too.

16:16.120 --> 16:19.160
How hard was that? That was beautiful.

16:19.240 --> 16:20.960
Let's just do that once, in church.

16:21.040 --> 16:22.880
OK, we're not going to do this, Carol.

16:22.960 --> 16:24.080
-We're not going to--
-Come on.

16:24.160 --> 16:25.800
We're not going to have
this conversation again.

16:25.880 --> 16:27.600
-Do you want to get going, or...
-We'll get dressed.

16:27.680 --> 16:29.000
-Yeah, see ya.
-Thank you.

Goodnight, my darling.

16:33.720 --> 16:36.320
-Thanks, Carol.
-See you later. Don't get drunk.

16:41.160 --> 16:42.400
That's great. Thanks, mate.

16:44.360 --> 16:45.960
Yeah, so why didn't you say anything?

16:46.040 --> 16:47.400
[waiter] Sparkling or tap?

16:47.480 --> 16:48.640
[Jeremy] She's my mother.

16:48.720 --> 16:50.360
-Hang on. Did you just hear that?
-What?

16:50.440 --> 16:52.720
"Sparkling or tap"?
We didn't even get a choice.

16:52.800 --> 16:54.840
-What?
-What, are we tap people, are we?

16:54.920 --> 16:56.320
What shoes are you wearing?

16:56.400 --> 16:57.920
Desert boots.
I told you that before we left.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.120
-They're nice.
-Yeah?

16:59.200 --> 17:02.080
So, you would have asked for
tap water anyway. I'm confused.

17:02.160 --> 17:03.280
Still, nice to be asked.

17:03.360 --> 17:05.358
OK, calm down.
Let's not just ruin everything already.

17:05.440 --> 17:06.960
-OK, fine.
-Yeah?

17:07.040 --> 17:10.480
Well, I don't understand,
because Mum and I fight all the time

17:10.560 --> 17:13.000
and, by the way, she told me
I never had to shave my legs,

17:13.079 --> 17:14.440
which is what I'll be telling Stevie.

17:14.520 --> 17:16.520
I don't... What does...
What does this mean?

17:16.598 --> 17:18.400
-I'm talking about your mother.
-Yes?

17:18.480 --> 17:19.920
And fighting.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.520
What? She doesn't fight.

17:21.598 --> 17:23.920
-Well, exactly, you guys don't...
-Yeah?

17:24.000 --> 17:28.240
My parents encouraged that
because they treated me like an equal.

17:28.319 --> 17:30.120
Yeah, so they didn't have to be parents.

17:30.200 --> 17:33.920
Tell me again about your progressive,
liberal, hairy upbringing.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.560
Before or after my dad died?

17:35.640 --> 17:36.640
Sorry.

17:38.120 --> 17:40.280
Shit. Um, let's not fight.

17:40.360 --> 17:41.360
OK.

17:42.640 --> 17:46.960
I just can't stand the idea of Stevie
listening to that conservative...

17:47.040 --> 17:50.280
stuff about marriage
and all the things that they talk about.

17:50.360 --> 17:55.080
Yes, OK, they're her grandparents.
They're my parents.

17:55.160 --> 17:56.840
So can we stop shitting on them

17:56.920 --> 17:59.600
because my upbringing
was different to yours?

18:01.240 --> 18:03.480
They cooked and cleaned all week.

18:03.560 --> 18:04.960
No, your dad hasn't.

18:05.040 --> 18:07.440
-He's incapable of it. You know that.
-He's not incapable.

18:07.520 --> 18:08.800
-Yes, he is.
-He just doesn't.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.680
-He's from a different generation.
-Fine.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.000
Sorry.

18:16.960 --> 18:18.320
To Stephen.

18:18.400 --> 18:19.440
To Dad.

18:20.480 --> 18:23.640
Yeah, truly a great human,
and the best man I've known.

18:27.160 --> 18:28.360
What?

18:29.480 --> 18:31.440
He did drink a lot, though, didn't he?

18:31.520 --> 18:34.360
He didn't drink... OK, so he drank at...

18:34.440 --> 18:35.880
-He did.
-Yeah.

18:35.960 --> 18:37.200
-He's a great man.
-He was.

18:37.280 --> 18:38.320
He's a great man.

18:40.160 --> 18:42.960
Maybe we should take your mum to brunch
on Sunday or something

18:43.040 --> 18:44.560
to thank her for the cleaning. And your Dad can come too.

18:46.240 --> 18:50.560
Actually... I think it would mean
a lot to Mum...

18:52.160 --> 18:53.320
if we all...

18:54.960 --> 18:56.240
went to church.

18:57.720 --> 18:59.000
Yep. That's the one.

19:20.920 --> 19:24.400
So, friends,
yesterday I phoned a young man.

19:25.440 --> 19:28.240
A smart man, good friend of mine.

19:28.320 --> 19:29.720
An engineer...

19:31.000 --> 19:32.120
and we talked.

19:33.040 --> 19:34.880
And we spoke about many things.

19:34.960 --> 19:37.240
About the football, the weather.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.760
I asked after his young family...

19:39.840 --> 19:44.080
Did you just wink at that little boy?
You can't do that. Not here.

19:45.160 --> 19:47.160
Yeah, of course I can. I was one of them.

19:47.240 --> 19:48.760
-You were an altar boy?
-Yeah.

19:48.840 --> 19:50.000
Well, you kept that quiet.

19:50.080 --> 19:52.600
-Shh.
-Ooh. Sorry. Busted.

19:52.680 --> 19:53.960
[Audrey clears throat]

19:57.600 --> 19:59.680
Yes, little Teddy boy. Here.

20:01.480 --> 20:02.520
Here.

20:03.960 --> 20:06.960
[gentle music plays]

20:08.040 --> 20:09.680
OK. That's alright.

20:18.160 --> 20:19.160
[sighs]

20:26.880 --> 20:28.160
[phone ringing]

20:29.280 --> 20:33.520
[priest] So now, more than ever,
it is our job to raise up our daughters,

20:33.600 --> 20:38.280
our migrants,
our LGBTQIA brothers and sisters.

20:38.360 --> 20:40.360
-What's the A stand for?
[priest] Anyone who's been oppressed.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.600
-Asexual.
-Ah.

20:41.680 --> 20:43.960
[priest] Anyone who feels marginalised.
-Like new parents.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
Very funny.

20:46.080 --> 20:48.000
[Stevie cries loudly]

20:48.080 --> 20:49.960
[priest] Now is the time to say to them...

20:50.840 --> 20:53.400
may they find a home here
in our community.

20:53.480 --> 20:55.160
[Audrey whispers] Shh, it's OK.

20:56.840 --> 20:59.200
I, um... I spoke to Mum.

20:59.280 --> 21:01.840
I... I think she gets it.

21:01.920 --> 21:06.720
But she does have one more jumper.
It's a cable knit.

21:06.800 --> 21:08.600
She'd already started it. It's just...

21:10.560 --> 21:11.600
You know what...

21:13.120 --> 21:15.760
I'm starting to think this whole thing
was a mistake.

21:17.080 --> 21:18.600
Please don't say that.

21:19.480 --> 21:20.680
Look at him.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.560
-How can you say that?
-No, a mistake for me.

21:24.640 --> 21:28.200
It's just, I don't understand. What...

21:28.280 --> 21:29.840
[Martha sighs]

21:29.920 --> 21:32.160
Dave, the more that I let you help me,

21:32.240 --> 21:35.480
the more the courts will consider
your application for custody,

21:35.560 --> 21:36.880
if you happen to make one.

21:36.960 --> 21:38.760
I'm not going to make an application
for custody.

21:38.840 --> 21:40.920
I'm not going to take him away from you.

21:41.640 --> 21:44.560
I'm sorry if what I've been doing
has made you feel that I would. But...

21:45.680 --> 21:49.400
Look, honestly, I had no idea
I was going to feel this way.

21:50.760 --> 21:51.760
It's just...

21:53.400 --> 21:55.440
I might not have any other kids.

21:55.520 --> 21:57.920
Come on, Dave.
You just need to find the right lady.

21:58.960 --> 22:00.400
I kind of thought that I had.

22:01.600 --> 22:04.640
You know I'm gay, Dave. Very gay.

22:04.720 --> 22:07.360
Really? Didn't you sleep
with that trombonist guy?

22:07.440 --> 22:09.600
[scoffs] Everybody slept
with the trombonist guy.

22:09.680 --> 22:10.680
Didn't you?

22:16.520 --> 22:20.120
Honestly, I get a little tired of the men
in frocks telling me how it is.

22:20.200 --> 22:21.200
[chuckles]

22:21.280 --> 22:23.240
You go back, I'll stay here.

22:23.320 --> 22:24.480
-Really?
-Yeah.

22:24.560 --> 22:25.960
Oh, that speech was amazing.

22:26.840 --> 22:27.840
So progressive.

22:30.080 --> 22:32.320
[chuckles] Thanks, Carol.

22:32.400 --> 22:34.400
-Audrey, um...
-Mmm?

22:35.720 --> 22:37.440
I just wanted to say,

22:37.520 --> 22:38.960
don't be pressured

22:39.040 --> 22:41.800
into resuming your marital obligations

22:41.880 --> 22:43.200
till you're ready.

22:43.280 --> 22:46.840
It's your body, and it's been through
something extraordinary.

22:47.880 --> 22:49.680
And becoming a mum is...

22:50.520 --> 22:52.520
Well, you just take your time.

22:53.280 --> 22:54.920
It won't hurt him.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.040
And anyway, I think he's got a hand on...

22:57.120 --> 22:58.480
uh...

22:58.560 --> 23:00.760

Thanks, Carol.

Bye-bye darling.

23:42.080 --> 23:43.360
-Bye.
-Bye.

23:43.440 --> 23:45.600
Oh, Audrey. I have something for you.

23:46.640 --> 23:50.160
-Here we are. I did your family tree.
[Jeremy] Oh!

23:50.240 --> 23:54.280
I thought it best if Stevie had both,
you know. It's all there.

23:54.360 --> 23:56.360
A very strong German line.

23:56.440 --> 23:58.000
Is that Dad's side?

23:58.080 --> 24:00.000
German Jews, no less.

24:00.080 --> 24:02.360
-I didn't know that! [chuckles]
[Gene] Mmm.

24:02.440 --> 24:04.320
Well, no wonder I have
a soft spot for Jews.

24:04.400 --> 24:07.320
You know, the rituals
and the comedy and the... soups.

24:08.360 --> 24:11.080
Wow, that... that's really special.
Thanks, Gene. Look, it's all about
this little family now.

24:13.960 --> 24:16.000
You know, you've started your own chart. Thank you so much for coming.

24:19.320 --> 24:22.800
-Jeremy, about the other night--
-Bye, Mum.

24:22.880 --> 24:24.440
Thanks for coming. It was good.

24:25.360 --> 24:27.520
-You take care of her, Jeremy.
-Yep, yep. Good.

24:27.600 --> 24:28.960
[Gene muttering]

24:29.040 --> 24:30.720
Which way did I put the car?

24:30.800 --> 24:32.920
Go right. Just go right. Straight down.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.280
What's going on with her?

24:34.360 --> 24:35.880
Ah, she caught me masturbating.

24:35.960 --> 24:37.160
Oh, wow.

[theme music plays]

24:39.040 --> 24:40.040
Oh!

24:41.240 --> 24:42.640
One home mocha.

24:42.720 --> 24:44.680
Oh, thanks. Yum.

24:45.800 --> 24:47.520
Jeremy, this stuff is so powerful.

My maternal great-grandmother
got married at St Mary's Cathedral.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.360
Big society wedding.

24:53.440 --> 24:55.240
There is a photo in here.

24:55.320 --> 24:57.840
And when Dad's family
came out after the war...

24:58.960 --> 25:02.560
they had to change their name
to protect themselves. Just...

25:03.400 --> 25:06.920
And I just found a cousin,
Yael, on Facebook.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.560
We look so alike. It's weird.

25:10.240 --> 25:12.240
Didn't your dad came over
from New Zealand?

25:13.320 --> 25:14.320
Huh?

25:21.640 --> 25:22.960
This says 'Halloway'.

25:24.120 --> 25:25.920
Dad's misspelt your name.

25:27.520 --> 25:28.760
You didn't notice?

25:30.520 --> 25:32.120
Did you check the tree?

25:37.720 --> 25:39.720
-This isn't your family.
-No, it's not.

25:40.560 --> 25:42.480
Have you already made contact
with cousin Yael?

25:42.560 --> 25:43.560
Yep.

25:44.560 --> 25:47.600
And, uh, do you think you'll just
pretend to be a Halloway?

25:48.280 --> 25:49.280
Yeah.

25:50.320 --> 25:51.400
OK.

25:54.480 --> 25:56.160
[sighs] Do you wanna have sex?

25:56.240 --> 25:57.560
What?

25:57.640 --> 25:59.360
No. How does that follow?

25:59.440 --> 26:00.960
Well, after a disappointment

26:01.040 --> 26:04.960
I thought you might appreciate
some sort of tenderness

26:05.040 --> 26:07.520
or, um, sexual excitement.

26:08.720 --> 26:11.800
No, because in ten minutes,
I'm meant to Skype my cousin.

Take that. Righto.
