00:13.233 --> 00:17.112
Terminal City is a 20-block no-man's-land
in the heart of Seattle.

00:17.193 --> 00:22.506
Closed ten years ago after a massive
toxic spill, it is without power or water,

00:22.593 --> 00:26.063
and it is a felony to go beyond
this security fence behind me.

00:26.153 --> 00:28.144
Terminal City is far from empty.

00:28.233 --> 00:31.509
It is home to rats, stray cats,
a few homeless humans,

00:31.593 --> 00:35.552
and according to many reports
an increasing number of transgenics,

00:35.633 --> 00:37.828
some of them far from human.

00:37.913 --> 00:41.701
Local citizens have begun setting up
flaming X's, like this one,

00:41.793 --> 00:45.547
outside the fence, as a warning
to the transgenics inside.

00:45.633 --> 00:51.151
- Go back where you came from!
- Hey, freakazoids!

01:10.393 --> 01:13.829
Two million years of human evolution
and this is what we get.

01:13.913 --> 01:15.585
You morons.

01:30.393 --> 01:33.749
- Did you get that? Tell me you got that!
- Freak!

01:57.833 --> 02:00.222
- Hey, Mole.
- Hey, Max. How'd it go?

02:00.313 --> 02:04.352
Ever notice how drug dealers have no
sense of humour when it comes to money?

02:04.433 --> 02:06.628
That'll keep us in beer for a while.

02:06.713 --> 02:10.068
Good, cos we got a lot
of new people around here.

02:10.152 --> 02:13.065
We've got X5s, X6s, even a few 7s.

02:13.153 --> 02:16.429
We got transhumans,
Nomlies, pregnant females.

02:16.513 --> 02:19.550
It's turned into Grand
Central Station around here.

02:19.633 --> 02:24.184
We're gonna need gas for the generator,
iodine tablets ASAP,

02:24.273 --> 02:27.948
blankets, bedrolls, Sterno for stoves.
We're gonna need food.

02:28.033 --> 02:32.549
We're gonna need weapons, bullets, ammo,
guns, grenades, anything you can get.

02:32.633 --> 02:36.785
- I'm gonna need more cigars.
- There are only so many hours in the night.

02:43.713 --> 02:45.351
- Evenin'.
- Hey, Max.

02:45.433 --> 02:48.630
Some people are calling you vigilantes.

02:48.713 --> 02:54.106
Nah, we're just concerned citizens.
Kinda like a neighbourhood watch troop.

02:54.193 --> 02:57.071
We want our streets safe
from these mutant freaks.

02:57.153 --> 03:01.032
Should we wait until they break into
our houses and take our daughters?

03:01.113 --> 03:02.592
Believe this pudknocker?

03:02.673 --> 03:05.710
They need to go back wherever
the hell they came from.

03:05.793 --> 03:09.866
- Get outta town, egg-sucking freaks!
- You're right on, Charlie.

03:09.953 --> 03:12.706
You heard 'em.
Looks like it's back to Manticore.

03:12.793 --> 03:15.830
Things are tense
at the gates of Terminal City.

03:15.913 --> 03:17.904
- Hey, Joshua.
- Hey.

03:17.993 --> 03:23.306
- What ya doin'?
- It's a flag. It's our flag.

03:23.393 --> 03:28.592
We'll need it when our transhuman drill team
is marching in the St Paddy's Day parade.

03:28.673 --> 03:32.222
- Don't forget half-time at Seahawks games.
- Hey, cut it out.

03:32.313 --> 03:36.591
An unknown woman on a motorcycle
went over the fence...

03:37.793 --> 03:41.468
This is you, me, even them. It's all of us.

03:43.033 --> 03:44.953
This is where we came from,
where they tried to keep us.

03:44.953 --> 03:46.545
This is where we came from,
where they tried to keep us.

03:46.633 --> 03:49.943
- In the dark.
- Secret.

03:50.513 --> 03:55.223
This is where we are now
because our blood is being spilled.

04:00.273 --> 04:03.345
And this is where we want to go.

04:05.073 --> 04:08.827
- Into the light.
- Light.

04:20.952 --> 04:24.707
You understand bringing in this team
compromises my cover at the agency?

04:24.793 --> 04:28.308
Your position has served us well.
The Conclave feels that...

04:28.393 --> 04:30.270
With all due respect to the Conclave,

04:30.353 --> 04:33.663
bringing in outside muscle
is not the solution to this problem.

04:33.753 --> 04:37.666
Hardly "outside muscle".
The Phalanx are the best we have.

04:37.753 --> 04:42.383
The elite of our warrior breeding line.
The tip of the spear.

04:42.473 --> 04:46.068
They come by direct order of the Conclave,

04:46.153 --> 04:48.951
so discussion is pointless.

04:52.273 --> 04:54.309
I bow to the wisdom.

04:54.393 --> 04:56.588
Fe'nos tol. I'm Thula, team leader.

04:56.673 --> 04:57.901
Fe'nos tol.

04:57.993 --> 05:02.987
I've heard a lot about you. I'm surprised
you couldn't handle one girl on your own.

05:03.073 --> 05:05.541
Your target's a little more than a "girl".

05:05.633 --> 05:09.421
You defend your failure
by flattering your enemy?

05:09.513 --> 05:14.348
452 is a threat to everything we've
worked for throughout the generations.

05:14.433 --> 05:16.867
Her death is our highest priority.

05:18.593 --> 05:22.188
Don't worry, Brother.
We'll clean your mess up for you.

05:29.873 --> 05:34.549
They designed her to be the perfect soldier,
a human weapon.

05:34.633 --> 05:36.624
Then she escaped.

05:36.713 --> 05:41.025
In a future not far from now,
in a broken world,

05:41.113 --> 05:43.502
she is haunted by her past.

05:43.633 --> 05:46.193
She cannot run.
She must fight to discover her destiny.

05:46.193 --> 05:48.627
She cannot run.
She must fight to discover her destiny.

06:28.793 --> 06:30.909
- You seen my girl?
- No.

06:30.993 --> 06:34.190
- Do I need a touch-up?
- No, you're good.

06:35.113 --> 06:37.308
Hey, guys. Check this out.

06:39.993 --> 06:41.108
It's a hat.

06:41.193 --> 06:44.663
With a fully rotational brim,
so you can always represent.

06:45.313 --> 06:48.828
Yeah. Represent your massive stupidity.

06:50.313 --> 06:52.065
That's one opinion.

06:52.553 --> 06:54.305
All right, babe.

06:54.393 --> 06:55.872
Sky.

06:55.953 --> 06:58.547
Normal, what's the good word, buddy?

07:03.953 --> 07:08.344
- The man's finally lost it.
- Many happy returns there, buddy boy.

07:10.113 --> 07:13.822
- It's not my birthday.
- It's right there on your application form.

07:13.913 --> 07:17.189
Oh, yeah. Boy, nothing
gets by you, does it, Normal?

07:17.273 --> 07:21.471
I made that without eggs and butter.
I know you look out for the physique.

07:21.553 --> 07:23.350
Go ahead, blow it out.

07:23.433 --> 07:26.505
If you see your colleague Max,
tell her she's fired.

07:26.593 --> 07:28.948
She gonna be here, like, any minute.

07:29.033 --> 07:31.991
Do you think I buy your lies
for, like, a nanosecond?

07:32.073 --> 07:33.950
Man is like a steel trap.

07:34.033 --> 07:36.627
Keep covering up for her, you'll be outta here.

07:36.713 --> 07:38.431
Ya promise?

07:47.113 --> 07:48.910
Basic CDC procedure.

07:48.993 --> 07:52.906
Yeah, to protect you against
your biohazard girlfriend.

07:52.993 --> 07:55.712
- I didn't mean that last part.
- It's OK.

08:14.913 --> 08:18.906
- This is awkward.
- For me, too.

08:28.993 --> 08:32.668
But I figured you should check
these out before they faded.

08:40.073 --> 08:43.270
- When did they appear?
- Last night.

08:45.233 --> 08:48.942
So, any luck on translating the stuff?

08:50.073 --> 08:51.711
Hold still.

08:55.673 --> 08:58.506
I'm making progress, but...

09:00.153 --> 09:02.621
some of it's still missing.

09:03.593 --> 09:07.268
Maybe not. Sorry.

09:13.593 --> 09:14.742
What?

09:17.113 --> 09:19.104
Just hm.

09:22.553 --> 09:27.866
If Sandeman put these in your genome
from day one, like your bar code,

09:27.953 --> 09:32.151
- then it's part of a plan.
- Instead of making my skin a Jumbotron,

09:32.233 --> 09:37.591
why didn't he give me something
I could use, like x-ray vision or something?

09:37.673 --> 09:39.550
Maybe he did.

09:43.353 --> 09:43.393
Maybe it just hasn't shown up yet.

09:43.393 --> 09:45.463
Maybe it just hasn't shown up yet.

09:52.713 --> 09:54.271
I gotta jet.

09:55.393 --> 09:56.667
Yeah.

10:03.113 --> 10:05.104
Could you zip me?

10:08.913 --> 10:13.589
I'm way beyond late, and I still
gotta go home and change.

10:13.673 --> 10:15.504
Thanks for this.

10:16.633 --> 10:20.069
Yeah. I'll give you a call
if I turn up anything on these.

10:20.153 --> 10:21.791
OK.

10:21.873 --> 10:23.864
Yeah.

11:05.393 --> 11:07.748
You sure this is the right way?

11:08.393 --> 11:10.543
I think so.

11:10.633 --> 11:15.149
It said south on 7th. I figure
we got another half a click or so.

11:19.833 --> 11:21.824
Can you make it?

11:22.673 --> 11:24.868
I'll make it.

11:59.913 --> 12:02.905
Hey, come back. Hurry, come.

12:03.753 --> 12:06.108
In. In. Go, go!

12:07.833 --> 12:10.552
- Hey, I'm Gem, X5. This is Dalton.
- X6.

12:10.633 --> 12:11.986
Joshua.

12:12.073 --> 12:15.509
- You're having a baby?
- Yeah.

12:15.593 --> 12:17.311
When's the baby due?

12:17.393 --> 12:21.102
Last week. Keeping my legs crossed
until we reach the promised land.

12:21.193 --> 12:24.026
Terminal City ain't exactly
the promised land,

12:24.113 --> 12:26.388
but we got guys with medical training.

12:26.473 --> 12:27.667
Watch out!

12:34.513 --> 12:38.108
- Is everyone fine?
- Yeah, I think so. You all right?

12:38.193 --> 12:41.151
- Yeah.
- Bastard backs out without even lookin'.

12:41.233 --> 12:42.905
We need to go.

12:45.313 --> 12:48.510
- We need to go.
- Yeah, yeah. Hang on.

12:48.593 --> 12:49.353
It's not starting?

12:49.353 --> 12:50.786
It's not starting?

12:55.353 --> 12:58.629
This is not good. We got company.

12:58.713 --> 13:00.669
We gotta blaze now!

13:00.753 --> 13:04.189
Man up, dog. You're the one
who wanted some action.

13:07.153 --> 13:09.348
Punk-ass! Look what you did to my truck!

13:09.433 --> 13:11.549
Punk-ass?

13:18.353 --> 13:21.151
You mean Mr Punk-ass, don't ya?

13:21.993 --> 13:26.430
- Damn. It's one of those freaks.
- Now, that hurts.

13:34.473 --> 13:37.943
I'll say one thing for ordinaries.
They know when to run.

13:38.033 --> 13:42.788
- Maybe we should run, too.
- We don't run, we fall back. Let's go.

13:51.953 --> 13:55.662
- Go for Max.
- Little fella, everything's gone sideways.

13:55.753 --> 13:57.664
It's FUBAR, people screaming.

13:57.753 --> 14:01.143
Gem is trying to keep her legs crossed
so the baby won't pop out.

14:01.233 --> 14:04.623
- What? Where are you?
- I'm at South Market.

14:04.713 --> 14:09.833
You're right around the corner from Jam
Pony. Find Alec, he'll get you a car.

14:10.953 --> 14:14.628
- Joshua.
- Max? Max?

14:17.633 --> 14:20.943
Battery died. She said Jam Pony,
then battery died.

14:21.033 --> 14:22.910
- Which way?
- Come.

14:22.993 --> 14:23.982
Go, go, go!

14:30.593 --> 14:32.470
Out of the way!

14:33.873 --> 14:36.068
- Freaks!
- Look at that!

14:36.153 --> 14:37.871
Suspects in sight.

14:37.953 --> 14:39.671
This way.

14:43.953 --> 14:45.944
I'm in pursuit!

15:02.473 --> 15:05.545
Alec, I'm so glad to see you.

15:05.633 --> 15:07.749
This is Gem. She's having a baby.

15:07.833 --> 15:10.472
So you stop by Jam Pony in broad daylight.

15:10.553 --> 15:14.068
Max said to come see you
and get a car and then...

15:14.153 --> 15:16.747
Don't turn around. Keep walking.

15:16.833 --> 15:19.188
You in the hood, drop your weapon!

15:23.713 --> 15:26.546
Drop the weapon now,
put your hands on your head!

15:30.473 --> 15:32.350
Get back or he's dead!

15:36.273 --> 15:38.264
I said stay back or he's dead!

15:39.353 --> 15:41.503
- Play along.
- Yeah, no problem.

15:42.673 --> 15:44.629
This should be interesting.

15:44.713 --> 15:47.989
- Jumpin' George W.
- Don't blow my cover.

15:48.073 --> 15:49.426
This cannot be good.

15:49.513 --> 15:50.628
- Got a back door?
- Yeah.

15:50.713 --> 15:52.704
All right, nobody move.

16:09.033 --> 16:10.785
They've got my boy!

16:12.233 --> 16:13.348
No, no. Go back!

16:13.433 --> 16:16.345
Freeze! I said freeze!

16:17.033 --> 16:18.705
Get back!

16:19.993 --> 16:22.553
Hold it right there, freak show!

16:27.433 --> 16:28.707
You're bleeding.

16:30.473 --> 16:33.271
Bullets'll do that to you.

16:35.433 --> 16:37.708
OK, you're safe now.

16:39.353 --> 16:40.388
No.

16:44.673 --> 16:47.267
I'm safe now.

16:52.553 --> 16:54.669
No one leaves!

16:54.753 --> 16:56.789
Nobody move!

16:56.873 --> 16:59.262
CeCe's one of 'em, too. Cool.

16:59.353 --> 17:03.824
CeCe, call base. Tell 'em we're in trouble.
Joshua, take the front. Mole, you got back?

17:03.913 --> 17:05.505
- Got it.
- Your name?

17:05.593 --> 17:08.983
- Dalton.
- Why don't you keep an eye on the street?

17:09.553 --> 17:13.910
- My golden boy's a mutant.
- We prefer "genetically empowered".

17:14.673 --> 17:18.382
- Take me, Jesus.
- Careful what you wish for.

17:27.953 --> 17:30.228
You in the building,

17:30.313 --> 17:32.702
this is the Seattle Police Department.

17:32.793 --> 17:35.148
The building is completely surrounded.

17:35.233 --> 17:40.830
Throw your weapons out
and come out with your hands visible,

17:40.913 --> 17:44.588
and you will be treated fairly under the law.

17:44.673 --> 17:50.589
Throw your weapons out and come out
with your hands on top of your heads.

18:27.513 --> 18:30.550
Hey. Who ordered a pizza?

18:44.873 --> 18:47.592
- My watch.
- It's all yours.

19:04.273 --> 19:05.633
- What's that?
- It's a hole in my body made by a bullet.

19:05.633 --> 19:07.783
- What's that?
- It's a hole in my body made by a bullet.

19:07.873 --> 19:10.592
Been there, done that. Check the news.

19:10.673 --> 19:14.905
- Hey, how's Gem?
- This girl is havin' a baby.

19:15.473 --> 19:18.112
I can still move, if you need to displace.

19:19.833 --> 19:24.224
It's turning into a damn pig farm out there.
Who said you could get up?

19:26.153 --> 19:27.745
Bathroom.

19:29.873 --> 19:33.309
Hey! No more pictures.

19:36.313 --> 19:37.826
Go.

19:39.993 --> 19:41.711
Go.

19:42.633 --> 19:46.023
- Who put you in charge?
- These people are not the enemy.

19:46.113 --> 19:48.343
Don't be so sure.

19:57.993 --> 20:00.268
I always knew you were a wrong number.

20:00.353 --> 20:02.742
You never had me fooled for a second, miss.

20:02.833 --> 20:05.984
Yeah. Transgenic Central
right here under your nose.

20:06.073 --> 20:07.062
Shut up.

20:12.993 --> 20:16.144
Listen up. I know things
are really tense right now...

20:16.233 --> 20:18.349
Gee, I wonder why.

20:19.953 --> 20:24.265
If you'll sit tight and be patient,
we'll get out of here before you know it.

20:24.353 --> 20:29.473
I got a hot flash. Me and mine are gonna
get out now. Let's go, people. Bip bip bip.

20:29.553 --> 20:31.623
Go on, take your best shot, frog boy.

20:35.953 --> 20:40.424
Nobody's shootin' at anybody.
Now, sit your raggedy ass down.

20:40.513 --> 20:43.630
Not only are you a daughter of Sappho,
you're one of them, too?

20:43.713 --> 20:47.547
No. What I am is a friend to Max and Alec
and CeCe and the rest of 'em.

20:47.633 --> 20:49.908
We walk outta here now, they're toast.

20:49.993 --> 20:52.666
- I don't have a problem with that.
- Well, I do.

20:52.753 --> 20:56.507
And I'm guessin' so does anyone else
here who is down with my girl.

20:58.153 --> 21:00.353
So how about we take a minute, figure this
bitch out, so that nobody else gets hurt?

21:00.353 --> 21:03.311
So how about we take a minute, figure this
bitch out, so that nobody else gets hurt?

21:05.713 --> 21:07.305
All right?

21:09.993 --> 21:17.024
Armed transgenics and transhumans
have barricaded themselves in this building,

21:17.113 --> 21:19.752
the offices of the Jam Pony
messenger service.

21:19.833 --> 21:23.872
Already angry crowds have gathered,
shouting anti-transgenic slogans.

21:23.953 --> 21:27.707
Just moments ago, an unknown woman
commandeered a Hoverdrone.

21:27.793 --> 21:29.784
She rode it over the police cordon

21:29.873 --> 21:32.990
and into the building in which
the suspects are barricaded.

21:33.073 --> 21:35.462
Police believe the woman is a transgenic,

21:35.553 --> 21:39.262
apparently coming to the aid
of the suspects inside.

22:23.673 --> 22:25.265
Yeah.

22:25.353 --> 22:28.584
- Good news. We've found our target.
- Excellent.

22:28.673 --> 22:32.791
The bad news is she's sitting smack
in the middle of Seattle PD, sector cops,

22:32.873 --> 22:36.422
my agency people,
and every news crew in the city.

22:36.513 --> 22:40.506
- This complicates things.
- I think we can hit her under their noses.

22:40.593 --> 22:43.903
I need a little bit of time
to heat things up. Be ready.

22:44.353 --> 22:45.547
Always.

22:52.793 --> 22:57.423
- Get the mutant freaks out of our city!
- Stay behind the barricade!

22:58.793 --> 23:01.865
Where's my phone? A secure line
should have been here.

23:01.953 --> 23:06.981
Get that news team behind that barricade.
Next camera I see, the guy goes for a ride.

23:07.073 --> 23:09.712
Special Agent in Charge Ames White.

23:09.793 --> 23:11.943
Nice badge. Picture looks just like you.

23:12.033 --> 23:14.991
Appreciate you securing the area.
We'll take it from here.

23:15.073 --> 23:16.393
I'm so pleased. Now I won't have to miss
my son's recital this afternoon.

23:16.393 --> 23:18.987
I'm so pleased. Now I won't have to miss
my son's recital this afternoon.

23:19.073 --> 23:21.064
Get this idiot outta here.

23:21.153 --> 23:24.429
You're out of your league.
Ask your men to stand down.

23:24.513 --> 23:28.791
Not until those hostages are out
in one piece. Where's my freakin' phone?

23:28.873 --> 23:32.502
You're not dealing with punks
who boost TVs for a living.

23:32.593 --> 23:36.063
They're trained, genetically engineered
killing machines.

23:36.153 --> 23:39.623
As far as I know, no one's dead yet.
I intend to keep it that way.

23:39.713 --> 23:44.912
I need you and I need your lady friend
behind that barricade, so I can do my job.

23:44.993 --> 23:49.032
- You force me to go over your head?
- Do what you gotta do, Special Agent.

23:49.113 --> 23:51.149
Just do it someplace else.

23:53.433 --> 23:56.823
- Where the hell is my phone?
- Kill the freaks!

23:56.913 --> 24:00.030
The economy is bad enough.
You want 'em taking your job?

24:00.113 --> 24:04.823
You want 'em living next door
spitting out their mutant half-breed kids?

24:04.913 --> 24:07.746
These mutant freaks
are an affront to nature.

24:07.833 --> 24:10.267
Who's taking care of this? Nobody!

24:10.353 --> 24:14.107
These freaks are running rampant.
They get to do whatever they want.

24:14.193 --> 24:17.629
These things aren't natural.
They don't deserve to live.

24:17.713 --> 24:21.467
They should be lined up and shot
like the rabid dogs they are.

24:21.553 --> 24:25.990
These freakoids smashed up my truck.
That's taking bread out of my mouth...

24:26.753 --> 24:29.631
Really FUBAR, little fella.

24:29.713 --> 24:32.511
We just gotta hang tough. It's gonna be OK.

24:33.833 --> 24:37.872
I don't know. The way
upstairs people look at me,

24:37.953 --> 24:40.069
I don't know if it'll ever be OK.

24:40.153 --> 24:45.227
I say, kill the freaks or send them back
to whatever cesspool they came from!

24:45.313 --> 24:46.792
Yeah!

24:49.673 --> 24:51.868
If it's a package, get a number.

24:51.953 --> 24:55.662
...to deal with this transgenic threat.

24:55.753 --> 24:56.742
Start talking.

24:56.833 --> 24:59.870
Detective Ramon Clemente
of the Seattle PD. Who is this?

24:59.953 --> 25:02.262
Let's keep it simple and you call me 452.

25:02.353 --> 25:04.662
OK, 452.

25:04.753 --> 25:06.823
I want a van with a full tank of gas.

25:06.913 --> 25:10.713
Before you give me your Christmas list,
why don't you let those people come out?

25:10.713 --> 25:11.862
Before you give me your Christmas list,
why don't you let those people come out?

25:11.953 --> 25:15.866
Not until I get my transportation
and a guarantee of safe passage out.

25:15.953 --> 25:18.228
You have a wounded man
and a pregnant woman

25:18.313 --> 25:22.465
- who, I'm sure, need medical attention.
- Just the van. We'll take care of our own.

25:22.553 --> 25:26.023
If I agree to your terms,
when do I get my hostages?

25:26.113 --> 25:29.583
Half when the van arrives.
Half when we get to our destination.

25:29.673 --> 25:34.144
- Which would be where?
- It's not far. They'll be home for dinner.

25:34.233 --> 25:38.351
You're dreamin' if you think
they'll let us drive off into the sunset.

25:38.433 --> 25:44.429
Get it through your head. The only way
they want this to end is with us dead.

25:52.593 --> 25:56.711
There's no point in discussing human rights
since they're not human,

25:56.793 --> 25:58.829
so they don't have rights.

25:58.913 --> 26:00.983
They don't even have souls.

26:01.073 --> 26:07.546
It's worse than that, because animals don't
have souls, but they were meant to be here.

26:07.633 --> 26:12.229
These things were never
even intended by God to exist.

26:12.313 --> 26:15.225
They are an insult to everything
in his creation.

26:15.313 --> 26:18.908
I was hoping you might be interested
in having me interview you

26:18.993 --> 26:23.271
about your life as a hot transgenic female
on the run in post-Pulse America.

26:23.353 --> 26:24.342
No!

26:25.953 --> 26:30.583
- But it is known that they are armed...
- Sorry, dude. Whatever.

26:32.473 --> 26:35.988
Please tell me that he is not the baby daddy.

26:36.593 --> 26:40.381
He was another X5.
We were breeding partners.

26:40.473 --> 26:43.829
- That sounds real romantic.
- It wasn't.

26:43.913 --> 26:46.188
...taking innocent people hostage.

26:56.593 --> 27:00.063
- What you got?
- A headache and I got your vehicle.

27:00.153 --> 27:03.509
Now send out the hostages.

27:05.593 --> 27:06.582
It's on.

27:10.073 --> 27:12.348
Get our people in position.

27:32.433 --> 27:34.264
Stand clear.

27:34.353 --> 27:37.106
Behind the barricade, people!

27:50.833 --> 27:54.223
- How's it look?
- I don't know, it's dicey.

27:54.313 --> 27:57.430
Got shooters on the roof,
bus door's on the exposed side.

27:57.513 --> 28:00.391
Yeah, it looks pretty messy.

28:00.473 --> 28:04.671
All right. You're gonna have to use
the messengers as shields.

28:04.753 --> 28:06.391
OK.

28:06.473 --> 28:12.309
Clemente, I'm gonna need the snipers
on the roof pulled back, or no deal!

28:14.073 --> 28:16.189
Sniper team, pull back.

28:16.273 --> 28:18.184
Pull back.

28:23.193 --> 28:25.184
All right, you're clear.

28:26.393 --> 28:28.907
Wish me luck.

28:28.993 --> 28:31.746
First group's comin' out!

28:31.833 --> 28:33.744
OK, guys, come on.

28:33.833 --> 28:37.462
Keep your arms in the air
and go slow. All right?

28:38.833 --> 28:40.824
Be careful.

28:43.433 --> 28:46.231
This way. Keep your hands in the air.

28:46.313 --> 28:48.668
Come towards the barricade.

28:50.353 --> 28:55.108
OK, 452. The keys are
in the vehicle. Your ball.

28:56.913 --> 28:59.871
They won't shoot.
We got a kid and a pregnant girl.

28:59.953 --> 29:02.421
They don't know which ones
are transgenic.

29:02.513 --> 29:05.869
A couple of us, they got a pretty good idea.

29:05.953 --> 29:09.263
- Come on.
- They saw you flying over their heads.

29:09.353 --> 29:10.581
I got you.

29:11.953 --> 29:14.513
- Thanks.
- They don't know about me.

29:14.593 --> 29:18.825
- Then help me protect my girl.
- All right, let's file in, guys. Come on.

29:19.673 --> 29:21.823
This is my cover story, man.

29:21.913 --> 29:23.904
Let's do this.

29:26.073 --> 29:27.506
Wait for my command.

30:00.913 --> 30:02.904
Take the shot.

30:10.433 --> 30:12.185
Max!

30:14.513 --> 30:15.548
Go!

30:16.073 --> 30:17.472
Get back!

30:27.473 --> 30:29.304
Cease fire!

30:34.993 --> 30:37.791
- Cease fire!
- Move, move, move, move!

30:45.473 --> 30:48.112
Fall back! Cover the door!

30:49.713 --> 30:50.702
Anyone else hit?

30:50.793 --> 30:52.784
- No.
- No.

31:25.073 --> 31:28.668
All right, get down.
I want everybody on the floor. Now!

31:28.753 --> 31:31.221
Stay there! Stay down!

31:31.313 --> 31:33.304
They killed her.

31:34.113 --> 31:36.388
Go take care of Gem.

31:36.993 --> 31:41.464
Why did they do this?
We did everything they wanted.

31:45.873 --> 31:49.422
This is on you.
I told you not to trust the cops.

31:49.513 --> 31:52.073
It wasn't the cops. It was White.

31:53.393 --> 31:55.349
- White is out there?
- Yeah.

31:55.433 --> 31:57.628
White's guys did this. They killed CeCe.

32:00.153 --> 32:03.509
They screwed this up on purpose
to escalate the situation.

32:03.593 --> 32:05.470
Yeah, well, it worked.

32:05.553 --> 32:09.990
What difference does it make who fired?
They all want to see us dead!

32:10.073 --> 32:11.586
Calm down.

32:11.673 --> 32:14.949
- I won't wait around for them to try again.
- What are you doing?

32:15.033 --> 32:18.469
Until we get safe passage,
we kill one hostage every hour.

32:18.553 --> 32:21.465
- Let him go!
- I don't take orders from your kind.

32:21.553 --> 32:24.192
- You take orders from me. Let him go.
- No.

32:24.273 --> 32:25.873
We gotta show them we mean business,
or we're dead!

32:25.873 --> 32:26.908
We gotta show them we mean business,
or we're dead!

32:26.993 --> 32:30.588
That's a good idea. Shooting people.
That's what White wants.

32:30.673 --> 32:36.305
- Prove you're the monster that people think.
- Shut up! You're not one of us!

32:40.073 --> 32:43.588
No, I'm not. But I'm standing
right here with you, aren't I?

32:44.593 --> 32:46.788
All right, people, listen up!

32:46.873 --> 32:50.388
If we don't stick together,
we don't get out of here alive.

32:51.113 --> 32:52.671
You understand that?

32:54.833 --> 32:56.824
OK.

32:58.833 --> 33:00.312
OK.

33:00.393 --> 33:04.671
But if they come near the building,
I start taking them out.

33:04.753 --> 33:06.823
Come on, Joshua.

33:11.753 --> 33:12.868
Joshua.

33:15.473 --> 33:16.462
Joshua!

33:19.873 --> 33:22.910
Thanks, guys. That was close.

33:31.593 --> 33:35.029
- Kill the freaks! They all should die!
- Yeah!

33:41.273 --> 33:44.424
You fed son of a bitch.
You get off my scene right now,

33:44.513 --> 33:47.027
or I swear I will kick you to the curb myself.

33:47.113 --> 33:49.502
Seems your snipers got carried away.

33:49.593 --> 33:53.347
- Those were your men and we both know it!
- Is that what we know?

33:53.433 --> 33:59.827
I don't know that, but what I do know is that
this was faxed in from the governor's office.

33:59.913 --> 34:02.268
So you got friends in high places?

34:02.353 --> 34:07.108
I draw your attention to the part
where I'm given overriding jurisdiction.

34:07.193 --> 34:11.902
- You screwed up, Lieutenant.
- Yeah, when I voted for this nimrod.

34:12.672 --> 34:15.585
My tactical team is gonna go in.
We'll get this done.

34:15.672 --> 34:20.667
And you are gonna stay out of my way.
But thanks for coming out.

34:38.193 --> 34:40.866
It wasn't your fault.

34:40.953 --> 34:42.944
This is all my fault.

34:43.033 --> 34:48.585
I let these people loose in the world,
but there's no place for us out here.

34:48.672 --> 34:51.710
There's no place anywhere.

34:51.793 --> 34:54.148
You gave them freedom, Max.

34:54.233 --> 34:58.909
And the thing about freedom...
it's never free.

35:07.993 --> 35:10.109
Push. Push.

35:11.113 --> 35:14.389
That's it, girl. Keep pushing.

35:14.993 --> 35:17.553
The situation is extremely tense...

35:17.633 --> 35:19.589
Yes. Push.

35:20.273 --> 35:21.831
Push. You can do it.

35:21.913 --> 35:25.906
No. Wrong. Ca-ca. Don't you know
anything about birthin' babies?

35:25.993 --> 35:28.587
Pushing is exactly what
she should not be doing now.

35:28.673 --> 35:34.509
Listen, I want you to breathe and relax, OK?
All right, just breathe and relax.

35:34.593 --> 35:37.824
Breathe and relax. That's it.

35:41.393 --> 35:43.273
OK. OK, you're fully dilated. You're in late
second stage. It's not gonna be long now.

35:43.273 --> 35:46.743
OK. OK, you're fully dilated. You're in late
second stage. It's not gonna be long now.

35:46.833 --> 35:49.984
I want you to breathe
from your diaphragm, OK?

35:50.073 --> 35:53.145
- And you know this how?
- My dad was a dairy farmer.

35:53.233 --> 35:57.146
I know my way around the inside
of a heifer better than you do.

35:59.833 --> 36:02.870
- I need a weapon!
- You're out of this fight, soldier.

36:03.593 --> 36:05.823
Me and my baby are getting out alive.

36:05.913 --> 36:10.623
You get that baby into this world.
We got your back. OK?

36:12.753 --> 36:15.108
I say we kill 'em like cockroaches.

36:15.193 --> 36:19.106
Burn 'em out, before they spread,
before they breed.

36:31.353 --> 36:36.427
Clemente, this is White. I'm inserting
my team now. Remember, zero interference.

36:36.513 --> 36:39.027
It's your world.

36:40.233 --> 36:44.829
- What is this? Who are these people?
- They're on loan from another agency.

36:44.913 --> 36:49.225
- What agency? I don't understand, sir.
- Let's keep it that way.

36:49.313 --> 36:53.909
You're not cleared for this op. Now, move
the men back and secure the perimeter.

36:53.993 --> 36:56.382
Walk away. Do it now.

37:01.113 --> 37:03.229
Look at them.

37:06.473 --> 37:10.864
When we carry her out in a body bag,
they'll be clappin', cheerin'.

37:10.953 --> 37:13.706
They'll never know she was their only hope.

37:24.073 --> 37:27.304
- It's me White wants. I'm going out there.
- No way.

37:27.393 --> 37:29.433
He wants this thing to end badly.
I won't let that happen.

37:29.433 --> 37:30.548
He wants this thing to end badly.
I won't let that happen.

37:30.633 --> 37:34.785
- Max, you're not goin' out there.
- I have to.

37:35.673 --> 37:38.665
- OK, take a breath.
- Max, listen to me.

37:38.753 --> 37:42.428
After you left, I translated
the new runes on your skin.

37:44.073 --> 37:48.225
- Is that the message from Father?
- That's right. I think it's complete.

37:48.313 --> 37:51.350
The symbols have multiple meanings,
but the gist is:

37:52.073 --> 37:55.031
"When the shroud of death
covers the face of the earth,

37:55.113 --> 37:58.867
the one whose power is hidden
will deliver the helpless."

37:58.953 --> 38:00.352
What does that mean?

38:00.433 --> 38:06.429
It means something really, really bad,
like maybe biblically bad, is gonna happen.

38:09.393 --> 38:11.907
And you're the one who's gonna stop it.

38:12.633 --> 38:16.546
Look, if all of this is
about White getting Max,

38:16.633 --> 38:19.466
specifically Max,
then she should go out there.

38:19.553 --> 38:21.748
- Forget it.
- She runs for it.

38:21.833 --> 38:24.905
- Lets him see her. She's fast.
- No.

38:24.993 --> 38:29.509
- He'll leave us alone because she's gone.
- No. No. Out of the question, Mole!

38:29.593 --> 38:32.426
Wake up, chimp! We're out of options here.

38:32.513 --> 38:35.311
No, you wake up.

38:35.393 --> 38:39.864
If she is the key to saving millions
of people from some kind of apocalypse...

38:39.953 --> 38:44.151
Your people or my people?

38:44.233 --> 38:47.111
People!

38:47.193 --> 38:50.230
Human beings, like you and me.

38:59.353 --> 39:02.868
They're coming. They're coming.
Carry Gem. Come on, let's go.

39:02.953 --> 39:06.582
- I don't hear anything.
- Joshua, you carry Gem.

39:06.673 --> 39:09.187
- We're clear.
- Don't argue. Dalton, let's go.

39:09.273 --> 39:12.982
Come on. I need everybody upstairs
right now. Let's go. Follow me.

39:15.633 --> 39:16.702
Hang on.

39:17.913 --> 39:19.904
Come on.

39:23.393 --> 39:27.784
- Remember, our primary target is 452.
- What about the hostages?

39:27.873 --> 39:33.152
Let's show the viewers at home what
the mutant menace does to innocent people.

39:33.233 --> 39:38.387
Take out the hostages, the freaks, the kid.
Take out anything with a pulse.

39:54.953 --> 39:58.628
Come on, guys. File in.
Stay low. All the way to the back.

39:59.353 --> 40:03.062
Sketchy, keep them quiet
and keep them down.

40:03.153 --> 40:05.713
- Stay down.
- Take cover behind the desk.

40:05.793 --> 40:09.991
Come on. Hurry up.
Keep her behind the desk.

40:18.033 --> 40:19.989
- Mole!
- Go, go, go. Move it.

40:32.593 --> 40:33.787
Take cover.

40:47.113 --> 40:51.868
Wait for my signal. We hit hard,
we hit fast, and we don't back off.

40:51.953 --> 40:54.865
This is for all the marbles, people.

44:03.233 --> 44:06.111
- 452...
- Just bring it.

45:39.753 --> 45:40.822
OK.

45:42.993 --> 45:46.542
Listen. OK, it's time to push now.

45:46.633 --> 45:49.989
Come on. Push, push, push
with all your might, all your might.

45:57.753 --> 46:01.632
All right, it's coming. It's coming.

46:43.993 --> 46:47.190
The baby's coming. I can see the head.
You gotta bear down.

46:47.273 --> 46:49.912
Really bear down. Time to push now.

47:10.593 --> 47:13.312
Bear down hard now, honey.
Bear down hard.

47:13.393 --> 47:15.463
That's it. Good!

47:20.113 --> 47:23.549
Go! Push, push, push, push,
push, push, push, push!

48:09.833 --> 48:11.266
- You all right?
- Yeah.

48:11.353 --> 48:15.232
One more big push.
Really crank down! Really crank down!

48:15.313 --> 48:16.826
Stay down!

48:16.913 --> 48:20.030
- Max, clear!
- Clear!

48:22.993 --> 48:25.871
Joshua, no! Joshua, no!

48:26.833 --> 48:30.951
- Joshua, no!
- He deserves to die!

48:31.473 --> 48:35.227
- He killed Annie.
- No, he deserves to die a lot!

48:35.313 --> 48:38.544
If you kill him now, the only
thing people will remember

48:38.633 --> 48:42.103
is how some transgenic killed
a human being in cold blood.

48:42.193 --> 48:45.503
And then they'll never stop hunting us.

48:56.673 --> 48:59.233
Bring around your muscle queens any time.

49:00.073 --> 49:02.348
I'll be happy to kick their ass.

49:02.433 --> 49:05.505
- We are not finished.
- Fe'nos tol, bitch!

49:15.033 --> 49:20.346
There you go.
What a dear little sweet soul.

49:25.953 --> 49:29.946
- No bar code. She doesn't have one.
- Then she's free.

49:30.033 --> 49:32.263
Not yet, she ain't.

49:39.673 --> 49:42.585
Weapons down, hold your fire,
team coming out!

49:42.673 --> 49:44.391
Let's go!

49:44.473 --> 49:46.464
Federal agents - step back!

49:49.353 --> 49:51.150
I need you back! Move, move!

49:51.233 --> 49:54.145
We may have a biohazard here, people.
Make a hole.

49:54.233 --> 49:57.111
Make a hole! Move, move!

49:57.193 --> 49:58.592
Let's go!

49:58.673 --> 50:04.669
Agent White wants your people in there
to secure the crime scene ASAP. Let's go!

50:04.753 --> 50:06.471
Let's go! Let's go!

50:12.673 --> 50:15.870
We're gonna need
to commandeer this ambulance.

50:15.953 --> 50:20.071
Agent White is not a man who likes
to be kept waiting, Detective.

50:24.273 --> 50:26.150
We'll take over from here,

50:26.233 --> 50:30.146
unless you wanna be stuck with
a six-hour decontamination hose-down.

50:37.633 --> 50:41.308
Clear the barricades!
Clear the barricades!

50:41.393 --> 50:43.827
Clear the barricades! Clear "em! Let's go!

50:43.913 --> 50:45.949
Nice and easy.

50:48.313 --> 50:53.103
Let's move it. Move! Move!
Let's go, let's move it!

50:53.193 --> 50:56.503
Move, move, move, move! Out of the way!

50:58.593 --> 51:00.868
- Where are we goin'?
- Just drive!

51:00.953 --> 51:04.582
- Can I turn on the siren?
- Just drive, fool!

51:08.313 --> 51:10.383
All right, let's get in there.

51:12.433 --> 51:14.105
We're clear.

51:14.193 --> 51:17.788
- Yeah, baby. That's what I'm talking about.
- It's all good.

51:17.873 --> 51:21.468
- Yeah.
- All right! We rock!

51:23.673 --> 51:28.508
- That chick was kicking your ass.
- I had it, I was just setting her up.

51:29.433 --> 51:32.027
All right. Head for Terminal City.

51:39.193 --> 51:42.868
- Anyone hurt?
- No, we're OK.

51:42.953 --> 51:44.989
But you better go look upstairs.

52:04.913 --> 52:08.223
Special Agent in Charge White.

52:09.633 --> 52:13.182
What? The transgenics taped you up
and took your uniforms?

52:14.513 --> 52:16.231
No way.

52:17.873 --> 52:20.990
And you want me to go after them?

52:21.073 --> 52:23.303
That's a good idea.

52:33.433 --> 52:35.424
We got company.

52:36.833 --> 52:41.031
Stop your vehicles now,
or you will be fired upon.

52:41.113 --> 52:45.265
Pull over now, or we will use
deadly force to stop you!

52:45.353 --> 52:47.821
Don't stop. Keep moving.

52:52.353 --> 52:54.503
- What should I do?
- Keep driving.

52:54.593 --> 52:57.869
- Follow Max. She knows what she's doing.
- OK.

53:05.393 --> 53:08.032
- Go straight through the gates.
- Hold on.

53:17.233 --> 53:21.272
You're gonna make a right, a left,
then straight up the ramp.

53:23.913 --> 53:26.222
Straight through the building.

53:33.513 --> 53:35.629
End of the line.

53:46.153 --> 53:50.669
Throw your weapons out
and let me see your hands!

53:51.553 --> 53:54.590
- So what's your plan now?
- Max?

53:56.433 --> 53:59.505
Throw your weapons out now!

54:00.113 --> 54:02.183
You heard the man.

54:02.273 --> 54:05.948
- Well, this sucks.
- I fought the law, and the law won.

54:06.033 --> 54:09.946
Throw your weapons out and put
your hands where I can see them!

54:10.033 --> 54:12.501
Throw 'em out! Do it!

54:12.993 --> 54:16.349
Step away from the vehicle
and keep those hands up!

54:18.233 --> 54:19.222
Do it!

54:20.713 --> 54:25.468
Put your hands up! Keep 'em up!
Keep those hands up!

54:26.473 --> 54:29.545
Step out of the vehicle
and keep those hands up!

54:29.633 --> 54:34.423
Get down on your knees
and put your hands on your head!

54:36.113 --> 54:37.626
Get down on your knees now!

54:40.153 --> 54:42.428
Do it!

54:47.953 --> 54:52.822
- 452?
- You can call me Max.

54:55.673 --> 55:00.349
- I think you better get down on the ground.
- Actually, I think you should probably go.

55:00.433 --> 55:04.346
- I'm not gonna tell you again.
- I'm not gonna tell you again.

55:12.673 --> 55:14.709
On your left.

55:45.153 --> 55:47.747
You can try to arrest us all,

55:47.833 --> 55:51.428
but you guys might wanna call it a night
and go have a beer.

55:52.513 --> 55:56.586
All right. All right, everybody,
let's back it up. Let's back it up!

55:56.673 --> 55:59.665
Outside the fence! Back it up!

56:02.033 --> 56:03.432
Come on, let's move!

56:21.553 --> 56:24.545
You kept today from being
a bloodbath. I respect that.

56:24.633 --> 56:28.023
- You held up your end, too.
- But you haven't won anything.

56:28.113 --> 56:30.991
This is gonna get ugly
and it's way over my head now.

56:31.073 --> 56:35.510
These people's lives depend on
the decisions that you make right now.

56:35.833 --> 56:40.827
I pray you make the right ones, Max.

56:59.553 --> 57:04.502
Escape and evade. We divide up into teams,
pick an azimuth, and go to ground.

57:04.593 --> 57:05.992
No, we stay here!

57:06.073 --> 57:09.224
In a couple of hours,
that perimeter will be locked down.

57:09.313 --> 57:13.670
Tanks, National Guard,
every cop within 100 miles.

57:13.753 --> 57:15.550
We'll be digging our own grave.

57:15.633 --> 57:19.421
Mole's right. We move now,
they'll never be able to catch us all.

57:19.513 --> 57:21.902
Where are we gonna go?

57:22.633 --> 57:27.866
I can't stop anyone, but I'm through
running and hiding and being afraid.

57:27.953 --> 57:30.467
I'm not gonna live my life like that any more.

57:30.553 --> 57:35.388
Aren't you tired of living in darkness?
Don't you wanna feel the sun on your face?

57:35.953 --> 57:41.789
To have a place of your own, where you can
walk down the street without being afraid?

57:41.873 --> 57:47.266
They made us, and they trained us
to be soldiers, to defend this country.

57:47.953 --> 57:50.865
It's time for them to face us
and take responsibility,

57:50.953 --> 57:54.946
instead of trying to
sweep us away like garbage.

57:55.033 --> 57:58.742
We were made in America
and we're not going anywhere.

57:59.953 --> 58:04.902
So they call us freaks. Who cares?
Today I'm proud to be a freak.

58:05.793 --> 58:09.103
And today we're gonna
make a stand right here.

58:10.313 --> 58:12.304
Who's with me?

58:49.713 --> 58:52.102
What the hell.

58:56.593 --> 58:58.504
Right on.

59:05.833 --> 59:10.304
What are these creatures like?
Is it true you delivered a transgenic baby?

59:10.393 --> 59:14.068
Yes, I did indeed, and a beautiful
bouncing baby girl she is.

59:14.153 --> 59:16.587
You're saying they're not all monsters?

59:16.673 --> 59:21.030
Monsters? No. No more than you and me.

59:22.753 --> 59:28.703
Hey! Let's go there, Sparky.
Not a country club. Bip bip bip. Move!

59:29.193 --> 59:32.981
As dawn breaks on this, the third day
of the siege at Terminal City,

59:33.073 --> 59:35.428
the situation is tense but unchanged.

59:35.513 --> 59:39.870
While hundreds of transgenics remain
barricaded inside the restricted area,

59:39.953 --> 59:43.628
police and National Guard stand
an uneasy watch at the perimeter,

59:43.713 --> 59:47.388
each side seemingly waiting
to see what the other will do next.

01:00:25.513 --> 01:00:27.947
Now look what you've done.

01:01:07.193 --> 01:01:09.388
