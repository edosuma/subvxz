00:06.655 --> 00:08.758
<i>The Yukon River is huge.</i>

00:10.896 --> 00:16.517
<i>Nearly 2,000 miles long,
and for 6 months of the year,
it's frozen solid.</i>

00:24.172 --> 00:26.482
<i>When it starts to crack,
that's the sign.</i>

00:31.241 --> 00:33.000
<i>You know
it is time to get going.</i>

00:35.379 --> 00:37.379
<i>The gold rush starts again.</i>

00:43.448 --> 00:45.793
<i>There's
a war for ground in the Yukon.</i>

00:45.827 --> 00:48.241
<i>All the good ground
is tied up.</i>

00:48.275 --> 00:50.482
<i>That's why we're digging
deeper than ever.</i>

00:52.137 --> 00:54.000
<i>We're hunting for ground.</i>

00:55.344 --> 00:58.137
<i>As soon as you start
getting desperate...</i>

00:58.172 --> 01:04.620
-[bleep], man.
- People can smell it on you,
and that's dangerous.

01:04.655 --> 01:06.344
<i>We need ground.</i>

01:06.379 --> 01:08.931
We got to trust something,
and we got to trust somebody.

01:14.172 --> 01:16.275
I'm 38 years in the game,

01:16.310 --> 01:19.379
and I've never seen
anything like this.

01:19.413 --> 01:22.482
<i>I spent a</i><i>
whole lot of money
in the offseason.</i>

01:22.517 --> 01:24.413
<i>I'm making this my year.</i>

01:26.241 --> 01:27.482
Let's crank it up.

01:28.689 --> 01:31.896
<i>This ain't like
any other season.</i>

01:31.931 --> 01:34.724
Right now,
it looks like we're dead
in the water.

01:34.758 --> 01:37.689
<i>Sometimes we have to force
our way through something,</i>

01:37.724 --> 01:39.896
that's just what you're
going to have to do.

01:43.586 --> 01:47.068
<i>Out on
the Indian River,
Parker, Tony,</i>

01:47.103 --> 01:50.103
<i>those guys are battling for
the last bits of good ground.</i>

01:50.137 --> 01:53.793
<i>I seen that coming and I got
the hell out of there.</i>

01:53.827 --> 01:57.689
<i>I'm doubling down
and I'm going
for 2,000 ounces.</i>

01:57.724 --> 01:59.103
Bigger the better.

01:59.137 --> 02:01.551
That thing's massive.

02:01.586 --> 02:04.137
<i>I've got no crew,
but I'm coming out fighting.</i>

02:04.172 --> 02:06.413
Whoo!

02:06.448 --> 02:08.551
You've got one job,
why can't you do it?

02:08.586 --> 02:11.137
Well, that's on you.

02:11.172 --> 02:13.965
This is what I've been
waiting for.
This is next level.

02:19.655 --> 02:23.137
<i>For me right now,
mining is more than just gold.</i>

02:23.172 --> 02:24.655
Oh, yeah!

02:24.689 --> 02:26.413
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

02:26.448 --> 02:30.931
<i>Two Green Beret's
leading the charge.</i>

02:30.965 --> 02:34.551
<i>I'm on a mission to
make a better life for
my all-veteran crew.</i>

02:34.586 --> 02:37.241
<i>It's about living
the American dream.</i>

02:37.275 --> 02:38.931
- You guys made it.
- How's it going?

02:38.965 --> 02:40.482
Good, how you been?

02:40.517 --> 02:41.862
<i>It's a treasure hunt.</i>

02:41.896 --> 02:44.103
Who doesn't love
a treasure hunt?

02:44.137 --> 02:46.551
Everybody that's looking for
ground is competition, right?

02:48.586 --> 02:52.448
Finally, sluicing gold.
This right here
is what it's all about.

02:52.482 --> 02:54.000
<i>I will not fail again.</i>

03:11.827 --> 03:14.551
<i>Klondike legend,
Tony Beets,</i>

03:14.586 --> 03:17.000
<i>once a farmer
in the Netherlands,</i>

03:17.034 --> 03:20.586
<i>now stands at the top of
a gold mining dynasty.</i>

03:22.206 --> 03:25.379
<i>At an age
when most people would retire,</i>

03:25.413 --> 03:28.586
<i>Tony's primed
to make big moves.</i>

03:44.172 --> 03:45.896
Well, I'm never surprised
by your plans anymore.

04:00.034 --> 04:02.068
Don't count your chickens
till they hatch.

04:04.689 --> 04:07.137
- Yeah.
Yeah. Piece of cake.

04:12.172 --> 04:13.413
Day shift, night shift?

04:15.793 --> 04:17.034
Here and the Hill?

04:20.827 --> 04:22.896
<i>For nearly 40 years,</i>

04:22.931 --> 04:26.137
<i>Tony snatched up
gold-rich ground in the Yukon.</i>

04:27.448 --> 04:31.689
<i>Now, with gold prices holding
at historic highs,</i>

04:31.724 --> 04:35.413
<i>he's looking
for a monster payday.</i>

04:35.448 --> 04:42.172
<i>To get his $16 million payout,
Tony's reopening
his Indian River operation,</i>

04:42.206 --> 04:46.068
<i>where he hopes to bank
5,000 ounces.</i>

04:46.103 --> 04:50.862
<i>40 miles north, he's counting
on his Paradise Hill claims</i>

04:50.896 --> 04:54.724
<i>to deliver the other
4,000 ounces of gold...</i>

05:02.068 --> 05:04.241
<i>...but there's
one massive problem.</i>

05:34.724 --> 05:36.000
Let's get going.

05:55.482 --> 05:56.758
<i>Leading the charge</i>

05:56.793 --> 06:01.172
<i>to push the first dirt
of the season
at Paradise Hill,</i>

06:01.206 --> 06:07.068
<i>a brand-new massive
850 horsepower D11 dozer</i>

06:07.103 --> 06:10.551
<i>that can shift
45 yards of dirt in one push.</i>

06:12.344 --> 06:17.275
<i>And a 100-ton 950 excavator,
the biggest in the Yukon.</i>

06:22.517 --> 06:23.724
All good.

06:23.758 --> 06:24.586
Okay.

06:53.103 --> 06:53.896
Okay.

06:59.689 --> 07:04.172
<i>Tony's first target
on the hill, an 8-acre cut</i>

07:04.206 --> 07:08.586
<i>he discovered 30 years ago,
filled with big gold nuggets.</i>

07:18.344 --> 07:22.206
We need to move a absolute
crap ton of dirt this year

07:22.241 --> 07:24.827
if we're going to
reach Tony's goal.

07:24.862 --> 07:28.896
Gold is high right now,
so strike
while the iron is hot.

07:47.551 --> 07:51.068
<i>When Tony discovered
the prime piece of land,</i>

07:51.103 --> 07:54.931
<i>he didn't have big enough
equipment to get down
to the pay layer</i>

07:54.965 --> 07:57.000
<i>80 feet below the surface.</i>

07:58.206 --> 07:59.655
<i>Even last year,</i>

07:59.689 --> 08:04.310
<i>it would have taken
at least three weeks
to get to pay.</i>

08:04.344 --> 08:09.000
<i>But with his new arsenal,
Tony wants it done
in just five days.</i>

08:13.344 --> 08:17.655
It definitely is nice
to have the 950,

08:17.689 --> 08:21.137
3 1/2 scoops to a rock truck,
then it's full.

08:33.551 --> 08:37.655
<i>As the Beets
race to transform
the family's future,</i>

08:37.689 --> 08:41.137
<i>daughter Monica has
the biggest role of all.</i>

08:49.724 --> 08:54.068
My father likes to pretend
he's not excited, but he
is very much excited.

08:54.103 --> 09:01.000
Tony can look so scary
and intimidating but just
melts for dogs and kids.

09:47.517 --> 09:50.724
Yeah, you know, I'm happy
to be back up here though.

09:50.758 --> 09:54.482
It's been brutally cold,
but it's just finally
starting to warm up.

09:54.517 --> 09:57.344
<i>In just eight
seasons in the Klondike,</i>

09:57.379 --> 10:00.724
<i>Parker Schnabel has gone
from an 18-year-old</i>

10:00.758 --> 10:05.172
<i>mining prodigy
to one of the region's
top producers</i>

10:05.206 --> 10:09.000
<i>after clocking record
gold totals year after year.</i>

10:09.034 --> 10:13.896
<i>Now this seasoned 26-year-old
is at a crossroads.</i>

10:13.931 --> 10:17.241
I don't know where we're
gonna be mining this year.

10:17.275 --> 10:21.068
<i>We're just eating all
the reserves faster than ever.</i>

10:24.206 --> 10:29.482
<i>Last season,
Parker mined a record
$14 million in gold,</i>

10:29.517 --> 10:32.172
<i>but he chewed through
so much ground,</i>

10:32.206 --> 10:37.344
<i>he's now running out,
and the future of his
operation is in jeopardy,</i>

10:38.551 --> 10:41.586
<i>forcing him into
survival mode.</i>

10:41.620 --> 10:45.379
And with gold prices going
up, it's a terrible time
to be looking for ground.

10:45.413 --> 10:48.827
Like, landowners
are in complete control
right now.

10:48.862 --> 10:53.000
<i>And that means doing
a lot of hunting because all
the good ground is tied up.</i>

10:53.034 --> 10:56.517
And that makes... that
makes me stressed out.

11:01.758 --> 11:05.551
I don't know that--
A good friend of mine,
you know,

11:05.586 --> 11:07.931
he's been here
before, Liam Ferguson.

11:07.965 --> 11:09.586
And Liam's in the area,
so I might just see

11:09.620 --> 11:12.275
if he'll come over and talk
to me a little bit about it.

11:12.310 --> 11:16.172
<i>Liam Ferguson drills for gold
all over the Klondike</i>

11:16.206 --> 11:18.793
<i>and knows just about
every landowner out there.</i>

11:20.310 --> 11:21.689
- Hey, man.
How's it going?

11:21.724 --> 11:23.655
- Good. How are you?
- Not too bad.

11:23.689 --> 11:25.068
How's your spring?

11:25.103 --> 11:27.000
- It's been going good so far.
Pretty busy.
- Yeah.

11:28.965 --> 11:30.206
What's up?

11:30.241 --> 11:33.068
We're just about done,
like, around our camp,

11:33.103 --> 11:35.586
and there's very few
pieces of ground left.

11:35.620 --> 11:38.517
Well, I drilled some ground
for your neighbor last fall

11:38.551 --> 11:39.965
that turned out pretty good.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.068
He was looking
to lease it out.

11:42.103 --> 11:43.620
And what's your opinion of it?

11:43.655 --> 11:47.620
It's really good ground,
yeah, but we got a very
clear defined channel.

11:47.655 --> 11:53.068
The holes range from
mid-40s up to mid-60s.

11:53.103 --> 11:58.724
<i>The neighbor's
ground sits a mile east
of Parker's Airstrip Cut.</i>

11:58.758 --> 12:04.551
<i>Liam's drill result
show unique pay streak
in an ancient riverbed.</i>

12:04.586 --> 12:08.931
<i>The tests show five times
more gold than other claims</i>

12:08.965 --> 12:10.827
<i>on the Indian River,</i>

12:10.862 --> 12:15.620
<i>but it's covered in a layer
of sticky black glacial
overburden</i>

12:15.655 --> 12:22.068
<i>60 feet thick, deeper
than any Yukon ground
Parker's ever mined.</i>

12:22.103 --> 12:23.758
It's a lot of dirt to move.

12:23.793 --> 12:25.517
It'd be expensive to strip.

12:25.551 --> 12:28.482
We haven't mined
much ground like that.

12:28.517 --> 12:30.793
Yeah, well, I mean,
I can at least tell
you that the results

12:30.827 --> 12:33.896
are real and that
we're confident in
what we found there.

12:33.931 --> 12:37.275
It's up to you to work out
a deal that makes it
make sense for you, I guess.

12:37.310 --> 12:40.275
It's not gonna be an--
a particularly good deal

12:40.310 --> 12:43.275
because he is a gold miner
and he knows what he's got.

12:43.310 --> 12:45.068
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

12:47.241 --> 12:49.758
Can you give me
some resource insurance?

12:49.793 --> 12:51.103
- No.

12:53.413 --> 12:55.000
A case of beer if
there's no gold in it.

12:55.034 --> 12:57.413
- Perfect.
- Call it-- call it even.

12:57.448 --> 13:02.034
<i>It's a rare chance to mine
such a gold-rich claim</i>

13:02.068 --> 13:07.758
<i>and Parker's only hope of
securing enough ground to
keep his operation running.</i>

13:07.793 --> 13:11.275
<i>I'm gonna go
see if we can make
something work with him.</i>

13:11.310 --> 13:14.620
In this industry,
as soon as you start
getting desperate,

13:14.655 --> 13:18.517
people can, like,
smell it on you.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.034
Right.

13:23.275 --> 13:25.000
Very close to being desperate.

13:28.137 --> 13:35.034
He is, you know,
not too interested in being
involved in TV stuff.

13:35.068 --> 13:39.862
And, uh, I definitely won't
get anywhere with him
if you're with me.

13:46.310 --> 13:48.758
His camp's just up here,
so I'm booting you out here.

13:50.068 --> 13:51.620
There's a car behind me
that'll pick you up.

13:51.655 --> 13:56.551
I think that's your guy.
Yeah. Get out. Please.

14:24.793 --> 14:27.379
<i>On an urgent
hunt for ground,</i>

14:27.413 --> 14:32.172
<i>Parker Schnabel returns
from a meeting with
a neighboring claim owner.</i>

14:32.206 --> 14:34.827
Um, right now, it's just that
it's a seller's market,

14:34.862 --> 14:38.000
you know,
price of gold is high.

14:38.034 --> 14:43.206
He's offered it to us,
not really in the most
favorable of terms.

14:43.241 --> 14:48.034
You know, I'm usually pretty
open about drilling and mining

14:48.068 --> 14:50.620
and deals and whatnot
because I don't really care,

14:50.655 --> 14:54.724
but he doesn't want
much details on TV, so.

14:54.758 --> 15:00.379
<i>Parker believes
the 9-acre cut could hold
8,000 ounces of gold,</i>

15:00.413 --> 15:07.103
<i>a $14 million haul,
but to mine
the 60-foot deep cut,</i>

15:07.137 --> 15:12.896
<i>Parker will have to drop over
$1 million just to get down
to pay dirt</i>

15:12.931 --> 15:17.413
<i>and find out
if the ground's
as rich as everyone says.</i>

15:17.448 --> 15:19.965
<i>They're willing
to gamble and take big risks.</i>

15:21.379 --> 15:23.034
We need to keep
the company running.

15:23.068 --> 15:25.482
Everything else is
just stupid details.

15:50.931 --> 15:53.206
I don't know what else
to do it right now,
I mean, it's just...

15:53.241 --> 15:54.517
it's getting out of control.

15:54.551 --> 15:57.689
Shut the pump off,

15:57.724 --> 15:59.724
<i>What did I drag

15:59.758 --> 16:02.793

that there would have been
another year.

17:15.655 --> 17:21.793
<i>2,000 ounces,
worth $3.6 million,
would move Rick's operation</i>

17:21.827 --> 17:25.103
<i>to the next level and prove
that his bold decision</i>

17:25.137 --> 17:28.241
<i>to get out of the Klondike
was the right one.</i>

17:30.068 --> 17:33.310
You know, having a dozer,
especially a dozer this size,

17:33.344 --> 17:35.551
<i>is kind of one of
the last pieces of
the puzzle to putting,</i>

17:35.586 --> 17:37.448
<i>you know, the entire
package together,</i>

17:37.482 --> 17:40.758
being a legitimate mine boss.

17:40.793 --> 17:43.620
Makes things pretty
real.

17:43.655 --> 17:49.965
<i>This season,
Rick has also invested
in a $1 million 750 excavator.</i>

17:50.000 --> 17:53.448
<i>He needs all the horsepower
he can get.</i>

17:53.482 --> 17:57.758
<i>After starting his operation
with a team of
hometown buddies,</i>

17:57.793 --> 18:04.931
<i>years of struggling to
find gold have left him
with just one, Chris Kruse.</i>

18:04.965 --> 18:08.275
<i>As good as it feels to be back
up here and doing our thing.</i>

18:08.310 --> 18:11.413
Being gone for six months,
it's never easy.

18:13.310 --> 18:16.793
<i>Got married to my fiancee
of ten years, Michelle.</i>

18:16.827 --> 18:19.551
<i>Rick married Michelle and I
in his backyard.</i>

18:19.586 --> 18:23.000
<i>And then we went to
a baseball game that night.</i>

18:23.034 --> 18:24.724
<i>A pretty good day.</i>

18:24.758 --> 18:27.000
And I hope everything,
you know,

18:27.034 --> 18:28.896
plays out the way we hope it's
going to this year,

18:28.931 --> 18:32.379
because it'd make it
that much sweeter being gone
from my wife for six months.

18:38.931 --> 18:40.034
Good to see you, buddy.

18:40.068 --> 18:42.275
The wash plant's
right where we left it.

18:42.310 --> 18:43.586
Yeah,
it didn't move itself.

18:43.620 --> 18:47.206
No, and it's still
half beaten to death.

18:47.241 --> 18:48.517
She's looking pretty sad.

18:51.827 --> 18:54.379
We're gonna have to
get this thing running because

18:54.413 --> 18:55.655
you know
the name of the game.

18:55.689 --> 18:58.551
If there ain't gold coming in,
it's money going out the door.

18:58.586 --> 19:00.068
Not a good business model.

19:01.448 --> 19:03.551
Well, as usual,
we've been plagued
with problems.

19:03.586 --> 19:06.448
I mean, Karla's...
she's focusing on
other things, man.

19:06.482 --> 19:08.448
So she's... she's not
coming back this year.

19:08.482 --> 19:11.275
That's gonna suck.
She's become my little buddy
around camp.

19:11.310 --> 19:14.172
You know, Carl, you know,
he's going in for his surgery

19:14.206 --> 19:17.827
and his health... I mean,
his health's number one.

19:17.862 --> 19:23.034
<i>Without mechanic
Carl Rosk or gold room
operator Karla Ann,</i>

19:23.068 --> 19:26.275
<i>Rick is a miner
without a crew.</i>

19:26.310 --> 19:29.448
It's tough losing,
you know, integral parts
of the... the crew.

19:29.482 --> 19:31.137
But we're gonna have
to figure out a way to do it

19:31.172 --> 19:33.896
because we've got 2,000
ounces to get this year.

19:33.931 --> 19:36.310
There's definitely
no way I can
fill both of their shoes.

19:36.344 --> 19:39.724
It would be nice to have
another set of hands,
though, I'll tell you that.

19:39.758 --> 19:42.758
And I... I got... I will have
some help for you, I think.

19:42.793 --> 19:45.068
So, you guys can hit
the ground running.

19:45.103 --> 19:47.758
Yeah, there's a ton of
to do. Let's go, man.

19:52.551 --> 19:54.689
<i>On the road
up to Duncan Creek,</i>

19:54.724 --> 19:58.482
<i>Rick's newest crew member
heads towards a fresh start.</i>

20:01.241 --> 20:03.758
<i>Here I am
on my way back up here
to the Yukon.</i>

20:05.172 --> 20:07.448
<i>I just knew it was
time for a change.</i>

20:07.482 --> 20:09.413
<i>A whole new crew,
whole new blood</i>

20:09.448 --> 20:11.482
<i>and a whole new way
of mining, you know.</i>

20:17.103 --> 20:22.655
<i>Mining veteran
Brennan Ruault is jumping
ship from Parker's claim.</i>

20:24.310 --> 20:27.103
Last year was, uh...
it was pretty brutal.

20:27.137 --> 20:30.344
Parker and I seemed to not
see eye to eye anymore.

20:30.379 --> 20:34.793
It's very draining
and stressful when you're
angry half the time.

20:34.827 --> 20:37.206
Like, that's no way to work,
you know.

20:37.241 --> 20:41.413
<i>Brennan met Rick on
Parker's claim six years ago</i>

20:41.448 --> 20:45.793
<i>when Rick was the foreman
and Brennan
a greenhorn operator.</i>

20:45.827 --> 20:48.931
Nice work today, boss.
We did good.

20:48.965 --> 20:51.241
Whoo!

20:51.275 --> 20:55.620
<i>Two seasons ago,
he was promoted
to co-foreman himself...</i>

20:55.655 --> 20:58.172
I guess the big question is
if you are game for that.

20:58.206 --> 20:59.517
I'll definitely step up.

20:59.551 --> 21:02.310
<i>...but after
a series of run-ins
with Parker...</i>

21:02.344 --> 21:03.931
I have hardly dug any of this.

21:03.965 --> 21:05.137
I don't care.

21:06.310 --> 21:08.724
Are you in charge,
or are you not in charge?

21:08.758 --> 21:10.758
<i>...he reached
the end of his rope.</i>

21:10.793 --> 21:12.793
So over this [bleep],
man.

21:14.241 --> 21:15.862
I'll pack my
and leave right now.

21:15.896 --> 21:17.551
I don't give a
about any of this

21:19.000 --> 21:20.379
Right there, I kind of knew,
I was like,

21:20.413 --> 21:24.275
"Well, this, I don't think is
gonna go any further for me."

21:24.310 --> 21:26.931
This year, I just want
to run some big gear,
move some dirt

21:26.965 --> 21:28.310
and, you know,

21:28.344 --> 21:30.758
go back to having
a nice fun summer
like it used to be,

21:30.793 --> 21:33.689
and-- and kill it
and hopefully
find a ton of gold.

21:40.620 --> 21:44.793
Ricky, coming to see
if you need some help
for this season.

21:44.827 --> 21:46.551
- How's it going, buddy?
- Good to see you, pal.

21:46.586 --> 21:49.758
- Yeah,
Been a few fricking years, eh?
- No,

21:49.793 --> 21:52.137
- Man, I'm glad you're here.
- Yeah, me too.

21:52.172 --> 21:54.862
You know,
Parker and I just seemed to,
for some reason,

21:54.896 --> 21:57.000
start butting heads
a little bit more
in the last few years,

21:57.034 --> 21:58.413
and it's just made it--

21:58.448 --> 22:01.103
made it quite tough
and draining
at the end of the day and...

22:01.137 --> 22:03.344
Yeah. Well, I certainly
know that feeling.

22:03.379 --> 22:04.758
- Yeah, yeah.
- I know you know.

22:04.793 --> 22:06.551
- Yeah.
- So now we're reunited.

22:06.586 --> 22:07.758
Yes, sir.

22:07.793 --> 22:09.344
I can't wait to get out
there and get started

22:09.379 --> 22:11.586
and start learning some
new ground here, man.

22:11.620 --> 22:12.896
- Yeah, buddy.
- It's gonna be fun.

22:12.931 --> 22:14.310
I'm gonna throw my boots on.

22:14.344 --> 22:16.103
Why don't you go throw
your work clothes,
I'll meet down there.

22:16.137 --> 22:17.758
Yeah.
Sounds good, bud, thanks.

22:21.620 --> 22:23.482
Oh, boy.

22:23.517 --> 22:25.724
- How's it going, buddy?
- Brennan.

22:25.758 --> 22:26.965
Kruse boy.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.689
- What's going on, buddy?
- Not much. Nice to see you.

22:28.724 --> 22:30.275
- Oh, you look good.
- Thanks.

22:30.310 --> 22:32.793
Wow.
We got a big crew.

22:32.827 --> 22:35.310
Right?
Yeah, huge.

22:35.344 --> 22:38.931
I'm excited personally
to start getting some gold,
so let's get after it, buddy.

22:56.655 --> 22:59.517
<i>I've been through some
pretty complicated scenarios
in the military</i>

22:59.551 --> 23:03.517
where my life and my career
was at jeopardy
every single day.

23:03.551 --> 23:08.655
And reality is gold mining
is the most difficult
thing I've ever done.

23:11.206 --> 23:12.724
<i>But I'm not a quitter.</i>

23:12.758 --> 23:15.172
I've never quit
anything in my life.

23:15.206 --> 23:19.000
If we can just find ground,
I feel like we could succeed.

23:20.758 --> 23:23.000
<i>Special Forces
veteran Fred Lewis</i>

23:23.034 --> 23:29.344
<i>is on a 1,500-mile journey
determined to resurrect
his gold mining dream.</i>

23:29.379 --> 23:32.586
<i>I've tried to settle in
with the civilian lifestyle,</i>

23:32.620 --> 23:36.034
<i>but nine-to-five job
is just not in my DNA.</i>

23:36.068 --> 23:39.103
<i>I packed up all my stuff.
I'm driving up to the Yukon.</i>

23:39.137 --> 23:41.827
<i>I need this freedom.
I need the risk.</i>

23:41.862 --> 23:44.310
<i>My mission is to find ground.</i>

23:44.344 --> 23:47.275
It's the only place I know
where there is good gold
in the ground for a fact.

23:48.827 --> 23:52.862
Because last season, I would
pretty much categorize
as a complete failure.

23:52.896 --> 23:56.931
I had a window of opportunity.
I took it.

23:56.965 --> 23:58.896
<i>In Oregon last year,</i>

23:58.931 --> 24:01.241
<i>Fred and his band of
combat veterans</i>

24:01.275 --> 24:04.620
<i>mined just $12,000
worth of gold.</i>

24:06.551 --> 24:08.827
That puts our
total at 6.39,

24:08.862 --> 24:11.103
which is honestly
embarrassing.

24:14.827 --> 24:19.344
<i>Now,
after striking out
prospecting in the lower 48,</i>

24:19.379 --> 24:24.000
<i>Fred's driving into
the fiercest war for
ground in decades,</i>

24:24.034 --> 24:29.206
<i>hanging his hopes
on a meeting with his only
contact in the Yukon.</i>

24:31.482 --> 24:35.137
Parker is the only one in
this game I know that I
can trust wholeheartedly,

24:35.172 --> 24:37.517
and he's the only one I know
that will give me advice.

24:37.551 --> 24:41.241
Maybe he has somebody I can
go talk to, maybe he has
ground I don't know about.

24:41.275 --> 24:43.068
It's really the only option
we have at this point.

24:43.103 --> 24:44.586
It's a Hail Mary,

24:44.620 --> 24:47.000
but I'd rather
throw a Hail Mary
than lose the game.

25:03.241 --> 25:05.758
<i>Fred Lewis has
traveled to the Yukon</i>

25:05.793 --> 25:10.896
<i>in a desperate last
attempt to find ground
to mine this season.</i>

25:10.931 --> 25:13.103
- Hello?
I'm in here.

25:14.931 --> 25:17.034
- You want a coffee?
I'm good, thanks.

25:19.689 --> 25:21.689
So how's everything
going here, man, um?

25:21.724 --> 25:26.896
It's going good.
We just signed the lease
on a block of ground that is--

25:26.931 --> 25:29.896
average depth is
like 55 feet of mud.

25:29.931 --> 25:31.551
Oh, wow!
- Yeah.

25:32.862 --> 25:35.344
Man, so you just gotta go
layer by layer on this, huh?

25:37.068 --> 25:39.758
So that's
a big project.
- That is yuck.

25:39.793 --> 25:41.724
That leads me to something
I was going to ask you about

25:41.758 --> 25:45.689
because, the team, we put
a lot into this offseason
looking for ground,

25:45.724 --> 25:48.689
and it's just... there's
nothing that was viable.

25:48.724 --> 25:52.000
So this is like my last
hurrah to come up here

25:52.034 --> 25:53.172
and see
if I can find something.

25:53.206 --> 25:54.482
Right.

25:54.517 --> 25:56.655
And so you're just out
looking for ground right now.

25:56.689 --> 25:59.310
Yeah, I don't necessarily
want to ask you for help,
but I know you might know--

25:59.344 --> 26:01.344
Aren't we all
looking for ground?

26:01.379 --> 26:03.724
Yeah, right?

26:03.758 --> 26:07.034
It is a little conflicting
for me because, like,

26:07.068 --> 26:12.034
there's a very finite
number of ounces of gold
in the ground...

26:12.068 --> 26:16.862
...and at a certain point,
everybody that's looking for
ground's competition, right?

26:20.103 --> 26:21.862
Now, I'm like trying to ask
for a favor,

26:21.896 --> 26:24.034
but we look for
different things, though.

26:24.068 --> 26:25.758
We don't need
a big piece of property.

26:25.793 --> 26:29.068
I think property you would
probably not even look at.

26:29.103 --> 26:32.379
So I was kind of hoping
you might be able to point me
in the right direction.

26:35.448 --> 26:36.551
Hmm.

26:39.413 --> 26:42.310
You'll have no problem
finding ground.

26:42.344 --> 26:44.206
But good ground.

26:44.241 --> 26:46.379
- That's the difficult part.
- Right.

26:48.620 --> 26:52.896
Very hard business,
and it's a difficult
community to break into.

26:54.620 --> 26:59.448
The Yukon will punch you
in the face pretty hard
if you're not careful.

27:03.862 --> 27:07.275
What would you do
if you were me, honestly?

27:07.310 --> 27:08.689
I don't know.

27:08.724 --> 27:11.655
I was in your shoes
when I met Tony Beets.
Probably go talk to him.

27:11.689 --> 27:15.137
You think that would be
wise just to show up
and try and get his number

27:15.172 --> 27:17.655
and call him and see
if he'll meet with me?

27:17.689 --> 27:19.137
Yeah, just show up
at Paradise Hill.

27:19.172 --> 27:20.862
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

27:20.896 --> 27:23.206
All right.

27:23.241 --> 27:27.206
You know, if you're into it
and, um, you know
what you're getting into,

27:27.241 --> 27:28.827
then more power to you.

27:30.896 --> 27:33.206
All right, man,
I'll get out of your hair.
I know you're busier than me,

27:33.241 --> 27:37.172
so that's pretty busy,
but thanks, dude.

27:37.206 --> 27:38.931
Oh, no worries.
It's good to see you.

27:38.965 --> 27:40.724
- Appreciate it.
- No worries.

27:40.758 --> 27:41.931
Let me know if
you need anything.

27:41.965 --> 27:43.310
Yeah, you know I will.

27:46.275 --> 27:49.620
<i>I wasn't expecting much,
but I was expecting
a lot more than that.</i>

28:00.482 --> 28:03.862
Definitely not comfortable
right now with
what Parker said.

28:03.896 --> 28:06.965
It does not lead me to
believe this is gonna be easy.

28:21.551 --> 28:23.413
You don't have time to eat,
except for at lunch.

28:23.448 --> 28:26.482
Don't have time to, like--
barely have enough
time to drink water.

28:29.896 --> 28:32.827
Now we're in kind of
a rush mode.

28:32.862 --> 28:37.551
<i>We are doing a big push
right now to expose the cuts,
get them all ready to go.</i>

28:37.586 --> 28:40.655
That'll allow myself and Tony
to focus out on the Indian.

28:40.689 --> 28:45.793
<i>As the Beets Family
wait on a water license for
their Indian River claims,</i>

28:45.827 --> 28:52.103
<i>it's all-hands-on-deck to
strip the Nugget Cut at
Paradise Hill in record time.</i>

28:54.724 --> 28:58.965
Now, Ruby and I are at home,
everybody's is gonna
have to work extra hard

28:59.000 --> 29:01.896
to make sure that we
get the 9,000 ounces.

29:03.068 --> 29:06.551
That's Tony Beets for you.
Go big or go home, right?

29:06.586 --> 29:09.310
Balls to the walls
all the time.

29:09.344 --> 29:14.206
<i>With Tony's new
D11 dozer and 950 excavator,</i>

29:18.655 --> 29:22.137
<i>revealing a massive

29:23.275 --> 29:27.103
We have hit gravel

<i>pulls down the pay dirt
to load it into rock trucks.</i>

29:43.586 --> 29:45.000
<i>You know,
it's crunch time.</i>

29:45.034 --> 29:47.103
<i>We have to get
this dirt moved.</i>

29:53.793 --> 29:56.793
Holy [bleep],
it's solid.

30:13.482 --> 30:17.206
Oh, I... I'm just
wasting time here,
I cannot get through this.

30:18.482 --> 30:19.827
<i>This is just not working.</i>

30:23.241 --> 30:25.448
Tony, do you copy?
Tony, do you copy?

30:27.034 --> 30:28.724
This wall is completely solid.

30:28.758 --> 30:30.103
<i>We are at
astandstill.</i>

30:30.137 --> 30:32.137
Can you please
come and talk to me?

30:55.103 --> 30:57.379
This wall is
completely frozen.

30:58.931 --> 31:00.448
Yeah, she's solid.

31:05.482 --> 31:10.448
<i>To rip through
the frozen section, Tony plans
to take his brand-new</i>

31:10.482 --> 31:17.551
<i>$2.7 million D11 dozer to
the top of the pay dirt cliff.</i>

31:17.586 --> 31:20.862
<i>He'll then go
right to the edge
of the 40-foot drop</i>

31:20.896 --> 31:23.482
<i>and use
the 10-ton ripper shank</i>

31:23.517 --> 31:28.896
<i>to break up the frozen
layer so the excavator can
get to the pay dirt beneath.</i>

31:34.034 --> 31:35.965
The D11 has arrived.

32:07.965 --> 32:12.137
You get high enough,
sink the ripper in, pull
the whole cliff down.

32:27.655 --> 32:30.965
<i>Tony maneuvers
the 120-ton machine</i>

32:31.000 --> 32:35.000
<i>right to the very cusp
of the 40-foot drop.</i>

32:35.034 --> 32:36.448
Tear the out.

33:08.448 --> 33:11.379
<i>As Tony busts through
the permafrost,</i>

33:11.413 --> 33:14.068
<i>Ruby removes
the pay dirt beneath.</i>

33:33.137 --> 33:38.793
<i>Tony has pay dirt
ready to run a full month
earlier than last year,</i>

33:38.827 --> 33:43.413
<i>a vital head start on his
mammoth 9,000-ounce goal.</i>

33:48.517 --> 33:49.724
Huh?

33:55.655 --> 33:56.724
You want to say that again?

34:12.793 --> 34:16.172
I'm finally, uh,
almost to the claim.

34:16.206 --> 34:19.137
<i>Parker Schnabel's foreman,
Mitch Blaschke,</i>

34:19.172 --> 34:23.586
<i>arrives at Scribner Creek
for a milestone season.</i>

34:23.620 --> 34:28.413
You know, I can't
believe that this year
is my tenth year of mining.

34:30.413 --> 34:31.896
You know, when I started this,

34:31.931 --> 34:33.241
I was just a young guy
coming up here

34:33.275 --> 34:35.758
trying to figure it out
and wanting to work on stuff

34:35.793 --> 34:40.793
and, you know, now I'm helping
run Parker's mine site.

34:40.827 --> 34:43.034
<i>Mitch first
came to the Klondike</i>

34:43.068 --> 34:49.034
<i>as a fresh-faced mechanic
for Todd Hoffman with
no gold mining experience.</i>

34:49.068 --> 34:52.275
<i>For the last seven years,
he's worked for Parker...</i>

34:52.310 --> 34:55.068
He's gonna be coming
right through here,
so watch yourselves.

34:55.103 --> 34:56.517
<i>...rising up the ranks</i>

34:56.551 --> 34:58.586
<i>to become his
most trusted wingman.</i>

34:58.620 --> 35:00.413
Whoo!

35:02.000 --> 35:04.586
<i>But now he's
without his co-foreman,</i>

35:04.620 --> 35:05.689
<i>Brennan Ruault.</i>

35:07.000 --> 35:09.241
He's my go-to guy, I mean,
we're bro-men, you know,

35:09.275 --> 35:14.103
we do all this together and we
work so well with one another.

35:14.137 --> 35:17.241
To try and find another guy
like that, um,

35:17.275 --> 35:18.862
it just doesn't
come around that often.

35:20.827 --> 35:22.344
It is what it is,
you know.

35:22.379 --> 35:25.103
<i>I'm back here
and just gonna have to try
and make the best of it.</i>

35:25.137 --> 35:27.137
Here we are.

35:27.172 --> 35:29.310
Oh, I see
he's got a golf cart.

35:29.344 --> 35:30.655
- What's happening?
What's up?

35:30.689 --> 35:33.275
Now see I might go for
a ride with you in that.

35:33.310 --> 35:34.931
- How you been, man?
Good. How are you?

35:34.965 --> 35:36.137
Not too bad.

35:36.172 --> 35:37.551
Good to see you.

35:37.586 --> 35:39.413
- How are you doing?
- Good.

35:39.448 --> 35:40.793
I'm sure you heard
about Brennan.

35:40.827 --> 35:44.000
I talked to him just
a couple of weeks ago there,

35:44.034 --> 35:45.758
said that he wasn't
going to be here this year.

35:45.793 --> 35:48.862
I'm just pissed off
that he didn't tell me
until March.

35:49.275 --> 35:50.068
You know?

35:53.482 --> 35:56.655
I mean, we've been
working hard to get
this system running good.

35:56.689 --> 35:59.344
Then you take a guy
like that out of the mix and--

35:59.379 --> 36:02.586
It's a-- it's a pisser,
but that's all right.
We'll be fine.

36:02.620 --> 36:04.310
Yeah, we'll just have
to figure it out.

36:04.344 --> 36:06.517
See what we can do, I mean.

36:06.551 --> 36:08.034
What's the game plan
for the season?

36:08.068 --> 36:10.379
We picked up
a new block of ground.

36:10.413 --> 36:13.620
Go Tuesday,
we had the first meeting,

36:13.655 --> 36:15.379
and on Saturday,
we signed the deal.

36:15.413 --> 36:18.034
Oh, wow! How deep is it?

36:18.068 --> 36:21.758
Average is... about 50.

36:21.793 --> 36:23.241
Well, it's got
a lot at the bottom.

36:23.275 --> 36:24.965
Just want to make
sure we don't it up.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.896
Well, I guess, uh, yeah.
I'll go get settled in.

36:27.931 --> 36:29.448
You can show me
your big project here,

36:29.482 --> 36:30.724
and we'll figure out
a game plan.

36:30.758 --> 36:33.034
For sure.
I'm glad you're back.

36:33.068 --> 36:34.379
I hope you're glad to
be here,

36:34.413 --> 36:36.172
'cause, [bleep], do we have
a lot of work to do.

36:36.206 --> 36:38.068
If I didn't want to be here,
I wouldn't be here, right?

36:38.103 --> 36:39.172
Right.

36:39.206 --> 36:41.482
- That's usually-- Whenever I--

36:41.517 --> 36:44.310
Whenever I say that,
that usually means
I don't want to be there,

36:44.344 --> 36:46.586
but I don't want
to answer the question.

36:50.172 --> 36:52.344
And, you know, we definitely
need some new dirt here,

36:52.379 --> 36:54.000
but it sounds like
it's pretty deep.

36:54.034 --> 36:57.241
So I'm pretty interested
to go take a look at that,

36:57.275 --> 36:58.827
see what we got
going on there,

36:58.862 --> 37:00.206
and just see what we're
gonna have to do

37:00.241 --> 37:01.172
to make this season work.

37:01.206 --> 37:03.586
And, you know,
without Brennan here, uh,

37:03.620 --> 37:05.931
it's definitely
not gonna be easy.

37:13.137 --> 37:14.758
<i>As the lone foreman,</i>

37:14.793 --> 37:18.241
<i>it's on Mitch to figure out
how to tackle the new cut.</i>

37:25.655 --> 37:27.034
What's happening there,
young man?

37:27.068 --> 37:28.206
How's it going, Mitch?

37:28.241 --> 37:30.551
Oh, not too bad. Well, I see
you guys found this place.

37:30.586 --> 37:31.793
Yeah.

37:31.827 --> 37:34.689
<i>Tyson Lee, last
year's rookie plant boss,</i>

37:34.724 --> 37:40.379
<i>and gold room expert
Chris Doumitt joined
Mitch at the new ground.</i>

37:40.413 --> 37:44.310
So what we got here is
this section of ground
through these claims here.

37:44.344 --> 37:47.275
This stuff
with the way it's drilling,
if the math is right,

37:47.310 --> 37:50.379
might be 10 ounces an hour
with just one wash plant.

37:50.413 --> 37:51.482
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

37:51.517 --> 37:55.103
So we're talking like
8,000 ounces possibly, then?

37:55.137 --> 37:57.827
The only problem
is 60 feet deep.

37:57.862 --> 37:58.931
Oh, geez!

37:58.965 --> 38:00.965
I've been doing it for
ten years now up here

38:01.000 --> 38:03.206
- and we've never gone
this deep.
No.

38:03.241 --> 38:05.379
<i>We're looking at a million
square feet of mud to move.</i>

38:05.413 --> 38:07.724
<i>So we're gonna have to mine
this a lot differently than
we've done anything else.</i>

38:07.758 --> 38:11.000
We've never had to tackle
a project like this.

38:11.034 --> 38:14.517
So once we do get it opened
up, we're gonna gut shoot

38:14.551 --> 38:15.793
this thing right through here.

38:15.827 --> 38:17.551
We're gonna take
just the best because

38:17.586 --> 38:21.068
when you're going
60 feet deep, you can't
hit marginal ground.

38:21.103 --> 38:23.034
It's going to look
like a crater.
It's going to look like

38:23.068 --> 38:24.758
the Grand Canyon
by the time we're done.

38:26.206 --> 38:28.379
<i>To get down
to the pay layer,</i>

38:28.413 --> 38:34.827
<i>Parker's crew normally strips
around 10 feet of overburden
with dozers and excavators.</i>

38:34.862 --> 38:38.482
<i>Mitch will have to
dig a narrow canyon
to follow the course</i>

38:38.517 --> 38:41.827
<i>of the ancient riverbed
and its deposits of gold.</i>

38:43.517 --> 38:45.793
<i>He'll open a small section
first to find out</i>

38:45.827 --> 38:48.931
<i>if the ground
is flush with gold.</i>

38:50.689 --> 38:53.896
<i>He wants to do it
in just 30 days.</i>

38:54.482 --> 38:55.655
Yeah.

38:55.689 --> 38:57.137
Should we name
it Mud Mountain?

38:57.172 --> 38:58.413
That works, because,
like I say,

38:58.448 --> 39:00.586
you're gonna have
a mountain range by
the time we're done.

39:00.620 --> 39:02.068
It's gonna be tough.

39:02.103 --> 39:04.620
There's no part of this
that's gonna be easy,
not to mention that,

39:04.655 --> 39:05.827
you know, we don't have...

39:05.862 --> 39:07.068
you know,
we don't have Brennan here.

39:07.103 --> 39:08.551
We don't have, you know,
a lot of people

39:08.586 --> 39:10.862
who have a lot of
experience with moving
material like this.

39:10.896 --> 39:13.310
I mean, if we have issues with
any of the machinery in this,

39:13.344 --> 39:16.724
we're gonna end up
a couple hundred grand
into this cut real quick.

39:16.758 --> 39:18.448
- Yeah.
- Let's hope it pays out.

39:18.482 --> 39:19.689
I'm gonna get back to the yard

39:19.724 --> 39:22.275
because we've got
a ton of gear in the yard
that needs work.

39:22.310 --> 39:25.620
'Cause the last thing we want
is breaking down
out here.

39:25.655 --> 39:27.379
- All right.
Let's do 'er, boys!
- Solid plan.

39:28.758 --> 39:30.896
<i>To dig out
the first section,</i>

39:30.931 --> 39:34.379
<i>Mitch taps rising crew member,
Tyson Lee.</i>

39:34.413 --> 39:36.551
How's everyone
doing this morning?

39:36.586 --> 39:39.034
Never been better.
That's good.

39:39.068 --> 39:41.448
Parker was saying that
he wants this cut opened up

39:41.482 --> 39:45.275
by June 1st when we started
it, so that gives us 30 days.

39:45.310 --> 39:47.931
Just be careful.
The roads are slick
and we just gotta try and move

39:47.965 --> 39:51.620
as much mud as we can
and try and keep the trucks
from getting stuck.

39:51.655 --> 39:54.482
- Drive safely fast.
- Yeah, exactly.

39:54.517 --> 39:55.655
Okay.

39:55.689 --> 39:58.758
Awesome.
- Let's get to work!

39:58.793 --> 40:02.896
<i>Tyson and his crew
are up against the toughest
dirt moving operation</i>

40:02.931 --> 40:05.413
<i>in Parker's mining history.</i>

40:05.448 --> 40:10.206
<i>When the melting snow
mixes with the thawing
find glacial silt,</i>

40:10.241 --> 40:14.137
<i>it creates
a toxic combination,
a slippery surface</i>

40:14.172 --> 40:16.758
<i>riddled with
quicksand-like holes.</i>

40:19.310 --> 40:22.034
<i>We're gonna have
three excavators swinging,</i>

40:22.068 --> 40:25.758
<i>five rock trucks,
four Cats ripping
and pushing day and night.</i>

40:25.793 --> 40:28.413
<i>Short on crew,
Parker pitches in.</i>

40:28.448 --> 40:31.551
It's definitely gonna
be a difficult block
of ground to mine.

40:31.586 --> 40:34.344
You know, some of the more
deep ground that--

40:34.379 --> 40:37.137
<i>that's on the Indian River,
it does have
some high royalty.</i>

40:37.172 --> 40:38.896
For sure it's gonna
be a challenge.

40:40.517 --> 40:42.344
I wouldn't be moving 60 feet
of mud if I thought there

40:42.379 --> 40:44.172
wasn't a hell of a lot of
gold down here.

40:59.482 --> 41:01.310
This is only the second time
I've been in a helicopter

41:01.344 --> 41:03.310
without a parachute,
jumping out.

41:08.482 --> 41:10.793
<i>Greenhorn miner
Fred Lewis</i>

41:10.827 --> 41:16.586
<i>is hitching a ride with
Klondike legend Tony Beets
in search of a claim to mine.</i>

41:27.896 --> 41:30.655
<i>Last year,
the Indian River produced</i>

41:30.689 --> 41:34.655
<i>over $30 million
worth of gold.</i>

41:34.689 --> 41:40.068
<i>High gold prices now
make leasing good ground
almost impossible.</i>

41:40.103 --> 41:42.758
You would come up here,
and you would think
there's so much, like,

41:42.793 --> 41:44.793
hard-to-reach spots,
but I'm seeing houses

41:44.827 --> 41:47.517
up in these little valleys
where people
have already come up.

41:50.862 --> 41:53.586
Makes me wonder how
much work's gonna have to go

41:53.620 --> 41:55.965
into finding something
that I can actually
mine this season.

42:20.896 --> 42:24.000
Yeah, and I don't have a lot.
I like a challenge, though.

42:36.689 --> 42:37.689
Yeah.

42:43.793 --> 42:45.068
Right.

42:45.103 --> 42:48.172
If you had a small group here,
how... how would you hit it?

42:51.103 --> 42:52.310
Yeah. Well, after the doctor?

43:02.758 --> 43:03.827
Okay.

43:08.586 --> 43:10.344
I definitely want
to look at it.

43:10.379 --> 43:12.931
All right. Well,
I'll get out of your hair.

43:12.965 --> 43:14.517
Appreciate it, Tony.

43:26.896 --> 43:29.517
<i>Fred finally has
a lead for a landowner</i>

43:29.551 --> 43:35.862
<i>who may lease him ground,
but it's 45 miles east of
the gold-rich Indian River.</i>

43:35.896 --> 43:38.896
I'm gonna go and talk to
Paul Phillips and see
what he has to offer.

43:40.896 --> 43:43.517
You know, people may
think that I don't
know what I'm doing

43:43.551 --> 43:47.931
or that I'm over my
head here. You know what?
I am over my head.

43:47.965 --> 43:50.000
Went up against a lot of
odds in my life, you know,

43:50.034 --> 43:55.482
just becoming a Green Beret,
the attrition rate
is over 90%.

43:55.517 --> 43:58.931
So at this point,
I'm all in for gold mining,

43:58.965 --> 44:00.896
and I don't see anything
that's gonna stop me.

44:17.068 --> 44:19.344
This thing is ready
to go. It's turnkey.

44:19.379 --> 44:22.827
<i>At the stripped
Creek Cut, Rick brings Kruse</i>

44:22.862 --> 44:26.517
<i>and new crew member
Brennan up to speed.</i>

44:26.551 --> 44:28.137
Well, we're going for
2,000 ounces this year,

44:28.172 --> 44:29.724
so we're gonna have to
seriously up our game.

44:29.758 --> 44:32.482
<i>I mean, the gold that
we got out of this creek
bed last year was good.</i>

44:32.517 --> 44:34.241
<i>It got us to our goal.</i>

44:34.275 --> 44:38.620
That was where we found
that 1 1/2 ounce
nugget at the very end, so--

44:38.655 --> 44:39.827
<i>That's crazy.</i>

44:39.862 --> 44:41.379
From what we left last
year in the Creek Cut,

44:41.413 --> 44:44.275
I figured we got
600-700 ounces to get
started sluicing with.

44:44.310 --> 44:45.724
And that's just money
in the bank.

44:45.758 --> 44:48.620
That gets us the money
we need to start stripping
these deeper cuts.

44:48.655 --> 44:50.689
It's early in the season, but
we really got to get moving.

44:50.724 --> 44:54.241
So the wash plant's where
we left it last year, it's got
to get moved over here.

44:54.275 --> 44:57.103
That distribution box we've
been working on,
we got to slam that thing on.

44:57.137 --> 44:58.931
And we're ahead of
the game from last year, so.

44:58.965 --> 45:00.931
We are, yeah, exactly.

45:00.965 --> 45:03.413
I basically-- I want
to be sluicing by
the end of the day.

45:03.448 --> 45:05.793
It's kind of
a time crunch thing.

45:05.827 --> 45:07.689
Let's keep it that way.

45:09.896 --> 45:12.551
<i>Short of time
and manpower...</i>

45:12.586 --> 45:14.275
Let's go, you [bleep]!

45:14.310 --> 45:17.103
<i>...Rick's skeleton
crew must first attach</i>

45:17.137 --> 45:21.896
<i>the 1.5 ton distribution box
to wash plant Rocky.</i>

45:24.344 --> 45:26.172
Why don't you guys wrap
your nuggets around

45:26.206 --> 45:28.172
how the we're gonna
get that thing in there.

45:28.206 --> 45:33.000
<i>To help out, Rick's
tapped local heavy load truck
driver Nathan Thornington.</i>

45:34.379 --> 45:36.620
How's it going?
- Good, buddy.

45:36.655 --> 45:38.517
I heard you guys needed
help out here this season.

45:38.551 --> 45:40.517
- Oh, yeah.
- How's it going, Kruse?

45:40.551 --> 45:41.655
Always good to see you.

45:41.689 --> 45:43.482
Buddy, you showed
up just in time.

45:45.793 --> 45:47.689
Really happy that we got
Nathan to join our crew.

45:47.724 --> 45:50.000
I've trusted him for years
to move my wash plants,

45:50.034 --> 45:52.413
my heavy equipment.
So compared to that,

45:52.448 --> 45:54.655
moving this distribution
box should be easy.

45:54.689 --> 45:57.034
<i>I've been around this
sort of stuff all my life.</i>

45:57.068 --> 45:59.965
And so hopefully we
can get this in on the plant.

46:02.172 --> 46:06.862
<i>Rick plans to
maneuver the ten-foot box into
the heart of the wash plant</i>

46:06.896 --> 46:11.827
<i>using the 480 Excavator,
then winch it into position.</i>

46:16.103 --> 46:17.689
Keep going.

46:17.724 --> 46:19.310
Yeah!

46:19.344 --> 46:21.068
We might be able
to slide it right in.

46:21.103 --> 46:22.896
If you go underneath.

46:22.931 --> 46:24.551
If you just go
real slow, Rick.

46:30.862 --> 46:31.965
Whoa!

46:36.103 --> 46:37.586
We'll blame it on the new guy.

46:37.620 --> 46:38.689
That's you.

46:38.724 --> 46:40.206
- Oh,

46:44.103 --> 46:47.034
Haven't you guys ever moved
a couch into an apartment?

46:47.068 --> 46:48.827
Just think of it
as a real heavy couch.

46:48.862 --> 46:50.068
Okay, come in.

46:50.103 --> 46:51.965
Down, down, down, down.

46:53.620 --> 46:54.793
Okay.

46:59.206 --> 47:00.689
There we go.

47:02.862 --> 47:04.172
<i>It's really nice
having Brennan here.</i>

47:04.206 --> 47:06.137
You know, he does have several
years of experience now.

47:06.172 --> 47:08.931
We're not gonna let
him think that that
gets him a free pass.

47:08.965 --> 47:13.000
If anything, that's going to
get him picked on more, gonna
have to keep him grounded.

47:13.034 --> 47:16.241
Get ready with that
chain, I'm gonna try
and lift on this end, Kruse.

47:16.275 --> 47:17.758
All right.
- You ready?

47:19.241 --> 47:21.275
- Hurry up.

47:21.310 --> 47:23.482
I got to crank it up.

47:23.517 --> 47:24.620
Hold on.

47:24.655 --> 47:27.275
- Easier said than
done.
- I know.

47:27.310 --> 47:29.137
All right. All right.

47:29.172 --> 47:32.034
I think I blew blood
vessel in my brain there.

47:32.068 --> 47:34.689
You mean a blood vessel
where your brain should be?

47:37.206 --> 47:40.137
Good job on this.
hanging off it.

47:40.172 --> 47:43.310
Distribution box is hanging
from the chains now,
that's how it's designed.

47:43.344 --> 47:44.931
Everything else is pretty
much ready to go.

47:44.965 --> 47:47.103
Like,
we get this thing over here,
plumb it in and we're good.

47:52.379 --> 47:54.172
I'm just gonna go.

47:54.206 --> 48:01.103
<i>Next task, drag
the 25-ton steel wash plant
500 yards to the Creek Cut.</i>

48:06.965 --> 48:09.620
It's always nerve-racking
moving a plant.

48:13.896 --> 48:16.000
<i>Anything else that
we destroy, break,</i>

48:16.034 --> 48:19.137
<i>or whatever, we can survive,
but not the one machine</i>

48:19.172 --> 48:21.896
<i>that gets our gold, so.</i>

48:21.931 --> 48:28.000
Just gotta try to take it
slow and smart, which I'm
not good at either of those.

48:45.827 --> 48:49.827
All right, that worked about
as perfect as we could
have asked for, I think.

48:49.862 --> 48:53.344
I haven't ever showed up
on the first day and
been ready to sluice.

48:53.379 --> 48:55.379
Can you believe
Nathan is pulling
that pump and that loader

48:55.413 --> 48:56.931
with just that
little ratchet strap?

49:01.137 --> 49:03.275
This is
the sweetest plant move ever.

49:03.310 --> 49:04.482
Yeah.

49:06.068 --> 49:08.344
Waterline and generator hooked up...

49:08.379 --> 49:09.758
Yay!

49:09.793 --> 49:11.344
Here we go, man. High five!

49:11.379 --> 49:14.310
<i>...Rick is ready
to fire up for the first time
this year.</i>

49:16.172 --> 49:18.344
But, for me,
there's always a certain
amount of excitement,

49:18.379 --> 49:22.413
but also a little bit of,
you know, anxiety
because the fuse is

49:22.448 --> 49:24.448
lit as soon as the button
gets turned on that thing

49:24.482 --> 49:28.137
and our pants
are on fire until October.

49:28.172 --> 49:29.586
You guys ready?
It's go time? Yeah?

49:29.620 --> 49:31.482
I'm ready, man.
You betcha.
Let's give her.

49:31.517 --> 49:33.827
All right.
Let's fire this thing up.

49:33.862 --> 49:35.413
Shake it up, brother.
Shake it up.

49:35.448 --> 49:38.448
Pull big rocks up there that
are gonna come tumbling out.

49:40.827 --> 49:42.137
Get the water pumping.

49:54.896 --> 49:55.965
Ready?

49:57.172 --> 49:58.482
First bucket of dirt.

50:03.758 --> 50:05.724
Looks good.

50:05.758 --> 50:07.206
We're ahead of the game
this year.

50:07.241 --> 50:10.551
I've never sluiced in
May before, so,
this is pretty awesome.

50:11.724 --> 50:15.103
<i>See, if Rick wants to shoot
for 2,000 plus ounces,</i>

50:15.137 --> 50:17.448
<i>you know, we got to make sure
we get every
damn nugget</i>

50:17.482 --> 50:19.241
<i>and flake of gold
out of this ground.</i>

50:19.275 --> 50:21.724
<i>Yeah, it's actually
kind of cool to see it up
and running, eh?</i>

50:21.758 --> 50:24.310
It's actually amazing.

50:24.344 --> 50:30.172
<i>Despite the bare
bones crew, Rick's sluicing
earlier than ever before.</i>

50:30.206 --> 50:31.862
<i>You know, we
haven't been here for long</i>

50:31.896 --> 50:34.551
<i>and my plan is always,
when we get here,</i>

50:34.586 --> 50:36.137
<i>we want to be sluicing
as quick as possible,</i>

50:36.172 --> 50:38.758
so we are gonna get
gold coming in right away.

50:53.517 --> 50:56.413
<i>A full month
earlier than last season,</i>

50:56.448 --> 51:00.862
<i>Tony's ready to fire up his
massive 8-foot wide trommel</i>

51:00.896 --> 51:04.172
<i>and start sluicing
Nugget Cut pay dirt.</i>

51:04.206 --> 51:07.517
<i>But his whole operation
now rests on firing up</i>

51:07.551 --> 51:12.793
<i>one 900 horsepower,
1,500 gallon a minute
water pump.</i>

51:20.793 --> 51:22.137
I'm here for my looks.

51:25.275 --> 51:27.000
At least one of us
should be good looking.
- Yeah.

51:36.241 --> 51:37.137
I'd put more in.

51:42.586 --> 51:45.206
TB's tried to turn
over the generator.

51:45.241 --> 51:46.482
Batteries are just clicking.

51:50.206 --> 51:52.137
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

51:55.344 --> 51:58.620
<i>To jumpstart the 900
horsepower water pump,</i>

51:58.655 --> 52:01.655
<i>Tony needs an engine
with a bigger battery.</i>

52:06.206 --> 52:10.344
So we're gonna run in the
349 and boost it off of that.

52:11.724 --> 52:13.275
Yes, he does.

52:30.068 --> 52:33.413
Hey, Monica, I need you
to hold these for a sec.

52:33.448 --> 52:34.793
Thank you.

52:55.724 --> 52:57.965
Sounds like me trying
to get up in the morning.

53:24.655 --> 53:26.103
Everybody clear?

53:45.965 --> 53:48.344
We did it.
We're back in business.

54:36.379 --> 54:37.896
<i>Wow!</i>

54:37.931 --> 54:40.275
<i>This is the stuff you think of
when you think of like
the old Gold Rush</i>

54:40.310 --> 54:43.758
and people coming up here
and the frontier
and vast unknown.

54:45.931 --> 54:50.241
<i>Definitely not comfortable
right now with what
Tony and Parker said.</i>

54:50.275 --> 54:53.103
<i>I'm not expecting to walk in
and just fall into something,</i>

54:53.137 --> 54:56.689
<i>but there's got to
be something here.</i>

54:56.724 --> 55:01.344
<i>Special Forces
veteran Fred Lewis
heads to Clear Creek,</i>

55:01.379 --> 55:05.000
<i>a remote and little
known area 45 miles east</i>

55:05.034 --> 55:09.551
<i>from the Indian River
in a last-ditch
attempt to find ground</i>

55:09.586 --> 55:14.034
<i>to mine this season with
his band of combat veterans.</i>

55:14.068 --> 55:16.758
The guys I put together,
you know,
we're a really close team.

55:16.793 --> 55:17.931
We're brothers.

55:17.965 --> 55:21.172
So if I'm gonna drag them
all up to the Yukon to mine,

55:21.206 --> 55:23.172
<i>it's gonna have to
be something that's
gonna put money</i>

55:23.206 --> 55:27.482
<i>in their pockets
and pay back the debt
the company made last season.</i>

55:27.517 --> 55:31.482
<i>Tony said not to make
those mistakes twice,
and we're not doing that.</i>

55:31.517 --> 55:34.793
It's not just about fighting
the first chance I get.

55:34.827 --> 55:36.620
<i>But time is running out,</i>

55:36.655 --> 55:41.517
<i>and all Fred has to go on
is the name of a smalltime
family mine owner</i>

55:41.551 --> 55:43.827
<i>given to him by Tony Beets.</i>

55:45.827 --> 55:48.655
<i>Trying to find this
Paul Phillips guy in hopes
that he has ground</i>

55:48.689 --> 55:52.206
that has water rights
and has permits, so we can
actually mine this season.

55:57.103 --> 55:58.137
- Paul?
- Hello.

55:58.172 --> 55:59.241
Fred Lewis.

55:59.275 --> 56:02.103
Whoo. You said
you were far out here.

56:02.137 --> 56:03.724
Yeah, we're a ways out.

56:03.758 --> 56:05.965
So, uh, am I catching you
at a good time?

56:06.000 --> 56:08.965
Oh, yeah, we're just starting
to get stuff out of
retirement for the winter.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.206
Well, I'm really kind of
cold calling you, I know.

56:11.241 --> 56:12.965
Yeah.

56:13.000 --> 56:17.206
But Tony mentioned your name,
and that was enough for me to
come out and talk to you.

56:17.241 --> 56:18.586
Yeah.

56:18.620 --> 56:21.103
Said that you might have
some ground you might be
willing to lease.

56:23.931 --> 56:26.620
We haven't really done
much on Clear Creek

56:26.655 --> 56:28.896
because we've always had
the other places to work at.

56:28.931 --> 56:32.103
We hadn't really
considered it yet, but...

56:32.137 --> 56:34.586
it's something
we'd look at for sure.

56:34.620 --> 56:39.172
<i>Paul Phillips
and his family used to
mine in the Klondike.</i>

56:39.206 --> 56:44.172
<i>But this year,
they've left it behind to mine
out here in Clear Creek.</i>

56:46.413 --> 56:49.379
I've got a real
small operation,
so I'm really trying to find

56:49.413 --> 56:51.862
a piece of ground
that's got that open space
we're looking for

56:51.896 --> 56:56.241
and, um, a relatively
non-complex mining operation

56:56.275 --> 56:58.689
because we're not the most
experienced operators.

56:58.724 --> 57:00.310
It's pretty much
a team of greenhorns.

57:02.068 --> 57:03.896
Well, this would be some
of the easiest for your team

57:03.931 --> 57:06.413
to handle until they get some
experience, I would think.

57:06.448 --> 57:08.137
It's quite simple.

57:08.172 --> 57:09.793
The first time we...
we washed down there,

57:09.827 --> 57:13.344
I stripped for one day
with the 400 by myself,
and we had enough.

57:13.379 --> 57:14.586
We sluiced for 6 weeks.

57:14.620 --> 57:15.931
Holy cow!

57:15.965 --> 57:18.206
It's lean ground,
but there's lots of it.

57:18.241 --> 57:20.724
- So just run it.
- Yeah.

57:20.758 --> 57:22.655
- And catch the gold.
- Okay.

57:22.689 --> 57:26.034
Well, I would love to see
like how you have done it
here, if you don't mind.

57:26.068 --> 57:27.310
Sure.

57:27.344 --> 57:29.172
We can walk down to the creek
and show you where we've been.

57:29.206 --> 57:30.241
Yeah.

57:32.655 --> 57:34.931
So this basically is,
uh, borderline the creek?

57:34.965 --> 57:37.137
- Yeah, the creeks right there.
Okay.

57:37.172 --> 57:39.793
So if someone were to come up
in here from start to finish,

57:39.827 --> 57:43.034
how long do you think
it would take them to
get into sluicing?

57:43.068 --> 57:46.689
Hmm. Maybe an hour. Two hours.

57:46.724 --> 57:48.482
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

57:48.517 --> 57:49.793
So it's pretty
much ready to go.

57:49.827 --> 57:52.000
Back your plant in,
turn the pump on.

57:52.034 --> 57:54.172
It's definitely
profitable mining.

57:54.206 --> 57:56.586
Well, what do you think
the odds of...
of maybe getting

57:56.620 --> 57:59.551
a test up here, um,
just to kind of
see what we've got up here?

57:59.586 --> 58:01.310
Yeah, I don't have a problem
with you testing.

58:01.344 --> 58:04.862
Okay. That sounds good to me.
That's more than, uh, no.

58:04.896 --> 58:07.517
- Yeah.
- I'll take that any day.

58:08.724 --> 58:11.275
<i>To come back
from last season's failure,</i>

58:11.310 --> 58:15.896
<i>Fred needs to be sure
the ground has good gold.</i>

58:15.931 --> 58:17.517
Okay. Right on,
I'll just fire this thing up.

58:17.551 --> 58:18.793
Sounds good.

58:21.758 --> 58:25.206
<i>I think right now
the treasure hunt begins.
But if it's here,</i>

58:25.241 --> 58:26.655
<i>we're gonna find it.</i>

58:36.034 --> 58:38.758
I'm really looking
for 10 to 15 colors,
that's really gonna be

58:38.793 --> 58:41.655
the target for what
I'm looking for.

58:41.689 --> 58:44.379
A lot of fine gold,
there's not any chunks in here
but...

58:44.413 --> 58:46.655
Oh, boy, I'm seeing
some good color.

58:48.379 --> 58:49.482
Oh, yeah.

58:49.517 --> 58:50.931
So this is what
we're looking for.

58:52.034 --> 58:54.413
I think this pan I just did
is sitting at about

58:54.448 --> 58:56.000
a little under an ounce
a hundred here,

58:56.034 --> 58:57.103
'cause I'm not a professional.

58:57.137 --> 58:58.965
I'm just--
I'm learning as well.

58:59.000 --> 59:03.689
But I'm at least at 0.8,
which is fantastic.

59:03.724 --> 59:07.482
<i>Fred calculates
he needs at least half
an ounce of gold</i>

59:07.517 --> 59:11.724
<i>in every 100 yards of dirt
to make his season pay.</i>

59:11.758 --> 59:13.103
This is our second hole.

59:13.137 --> 59:14.689
It's on the left
side of the valley.

59:17.655 --> 59:21.172
I honestly don't know.
Right now, I'm looking at
probably 0.6,

59:21.206 --> 59:23.827
maybe 0.7 per 100
out of that pan.

59:23.862 --> 59:26.379
<i>And this is exactly why
we came to the Yukon.</i>

59:26.413 --> 59:28.827
If you can find a claim
with a good claim owner
that has potential,

59:28.862 --> 59:31.344
and it hasn't been mined out,
you're probably gonna
find gold.

59:33.517 --> 59:34.931
<i>I know that there's
stripped ground here.</i>

59:34.965 --> 59:36.862
<i>I know it's easy
for me to access.</i>

59:36.896 --> 59:38.517
<i>I know the gold's here.</i>

59:38.551 --> 59:43.241
Depending on what Paul and I
come up with for royalty,
this could be workable.

59:52.689 --> 59:56.034
<i>At Parker Schnabel's
Mud Mountain Cut...</i>

59:56.068 --> 59:59.655
Next truck come back in,
right where my bucket is.

59:59.689 --> 1:00:03.034
<i>Tyson Lee is on
a mission to get down to pay</i>

1:00:03.068 --> 1:00:06.413
<i>and test what could
be the richest ground
they've ever mined.</i>

1:00:08.206 --> 1:00:13.172
<i>But first, he has to
strip over a million
cubic yards of overburden.</i>

1:00:15.103 --> 1:00:18.068
<i>You know, we're a week
into Mud Mountain and we've
made a hell of a dent.</i>

1:00:18.103 --> 1:00:20.103
And as you can tell,
it's warming up

1:00:20.137 --> 1:00:24.413
and definitely slowly
sliding backwards as
the mud gets ahead of us, so.

1:00:25.896 --> 1:00:28.482
<i>Thicker than
regular overburden,</i>

1:00:28.517 --> 1:00:33.655
<i>Mud Mountain's sticky wet
black muck is
a force to be reckoned with.</i>

1:00:37.931 --> 1:00:41.482
So far, we've had
two rock trucks down
for three days

1:00:41.517 --> 1:00:43.586
at 100 loads each a day.

1:00:46.379 --> 1:00:49.448
<i>You know, we really cannot
afford breakdowns right now.</i>

1:00:56.068 --> 1:00:58.137
Due to the mud,
there's these big holes,

1:00:58.172 --> 1:01:00.241
so I've got to drive
really slow,

1:01:00.275 --> 1:01:02.551
otherwise, I'm gonna
slam the rock truck

1:01:02.586 --> 1:01:07.689
and it can really damage
the hydraulics.
I'm sliding everywhere.

1:01:09.827 --> 1:01:13.655
<i>Although now we have
a bit more space so we can
actually fit in four trucks.</i>

1:01:15.482 --> 1:01:19.034
<i>We don't have much time here,
because as the snow melts,</i>

1:01:19.068 --> 1:01:23.793
all the water is coming
down from the hill, so we
are getting a lot of mud.

1:01:23.827 --> 1:01:26.655
Um, so we got to
be pretty fast here.

1:01:26.689 --> 1:01:29.586
<i>So we're just flying here.</i>

1:01:47.379 --> 1:01:50.758
It's very, very difficult
right now, it's... it's tough.

1:01:52.241 --> 1:01:55.517
It's advanced rock driving
if that's a thing.

1:01:55.551 --> 1:01:58.965
<i>To keep on track
with Parker's 30-day deadline,</i>

1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:02.517
<i>Tyson's rock trucks need
to dump at least 400 loads of</i>

1:02:02.551 --> 1:02:05.310
<i>overburden a day
at the waste site.</i>

1:02:05.344 --> 1:02:10.931
<i>But with multiple breakdowns,
Tyson is falling further
and further behind.</i>

1:02:10.965 --> 1:02:14.586
I'm normally a sluicer, man.
I don't move mud.

1:02:14.620 --> 1:02:18.344
<i>You know, Brennan could
run any piece of equipment
that was around here.</i>

1:02:18.379 --> 1:02:21.724
You can't replace that
experience overnight.

1:02:21.758 --> 1:02:24.172
<i>Like anything in life,
anything new
is a learning curve,</i>

1:02:24.206 --> 1:02:27.034
and this is gonna be
one hell of a learning curve.

1:02:27.068 --> 1:02:28.413
<i>Can I steal a truck here?</i>

1:02:29.310 --> 1:02:31.655
Can I have one truck, please?

1:02:31.689 --> 1:02:33.344
<i>Hey, Jordan, I got a copy.</i>

1:02:33.379 --> 1:02:36.413
Yeah, man,
my truck keeps
going into limp mode.

1:02:36.448 --> 1:02:37.517
<i>Won't accelerate.</i>

1:02:37.551 --> 1:02:39.862
Won't really do anything
in here.

1:02:39.896 --> 1:02:43.689
<i>Rookie Jordan Tatlow's truck
is in limp mode,</i>

1:02:43.724 --> 1:02:46.862
<i>a safety mechanism
that slows it right down</i>

1:02:46.896 --> 1:02:49.103
<i>when there's
a mechanical problem.</i>

1:02:49.137 --> 1:02:50.896
<i>Bring it up
to the mechanic's up there</i>

1:02:50.931 --> 1:02:52.586
<i>and let them know.
That's their department.</i>

1:02:54.586 --> 1:02:57.551
<i>One rock truck goes down,
that's 100 less loads
a day we're getting.</i>

1:02:57.586 --> 1:02:59.586
Or 100 loads a day
that we're gonna have to get

1:02:59.620 --> 1:03:02.827
out of Mud Mountain at a later
date when it's warmer
and when the mud is thicker.

1:03:04.275 --> 1:03:06.206
<i>Hey, Mitch,
you got a copy, Mitch?</i>

1:03:06.241 --> 1:03:09.413
Yeah, we got another truck
down here at Mud Mountain,
one's coming your way.

1:03:09.448 --> 1:03:11.724
<i>Oh, wonderful,
just what we need.</i>

1:03:11.758 --> 1:03:14.137
<i>Already,
two trucks down,</i>

1:03:14.172 --> 1:03:17.034
<i>Tyson must send another
to be fixed.</i>

1:03:17.068 --> 1:03:18.793
<i>Mitch,
he's in the yard right now</i>

1:03:18.827 --> 1:03:20.517
<i>trying to keep
the mechanics going,</i>

1:03:20.551 --> 1:03:23.793
<i>you know, trying to
get everyone caught up,
but it's just tough.</i>

1:03:23.827 --> 1:03:30.275
I'd say it's Mud Mountain one
and our crew zero.

1:03:30.310 --> 1:03:35.586
<i>In the yard,
foreman Mitch is back where
he started nine years ago,</i>

1:03:35.620 --> 1:03:38.379
<i>wrenching to keep up
with broken equipment.</i>

1:03:38.413 --> 1:03:41.413
We're out here doing
everything we can to
get these trucks fixed.

1:03:41.448 --> 1:03:45.206
<i>All that permafrost muck
that just keeps getting
into everything.</i>

1:03:45.241 --> 1:03:48.310
And, right now, we're not even
keeping our heads above water.

1:03:53.517 --> 1:03:54.689
Hi.
What up?

1:03:54.724 --> 1:03:56.724
Are you deep in the
middle of something?

1:03:56.758 --> 1:03:58.862
What do you got going on?
- Mud Mountain.

1:03:58.896 --> 1:04:00.000
<i>Do you want to
bump down there?</i>

1:04:00.034 --> 1:04:01.931
I know, we got a ton of
work to do out in the cut,

1:04:01.965 --> 1:04:04.000
but we got way
more to do right here.

1:04:04.034 --> 1:04:06.068
If we keep stopping,
we're never gonna
get any of it done.

1:04:06.103 --> 1:04:08.620
Okay.
- But we're just trying
to get that crashed out

1:04:08.655 --> 1:04:10.172
and so we can get on
to the next one here.

1:04:12.068 --> 1:04:15.137
I know, as a foreman,
probably not the best,
you know,

1:04:15.172 --> 1:04:17.379
use of my time to be
in here working on stuff.

1:04:17.413 --> 1:04:21.137
<i>Right now, we need to be
thinking about moving dirt,
not working on trucks.</i>

1:04:21.172 --> 1:04:22.724
<i>But we have
no other option right now.</i>

1:04:22.758 --> 1:04:25.379
We've got to get these
machines to where we can
rely on them every day.

1:04:25.413 --> 1:04:27.068
They can go out
and do their job.

1:04:27.103 --> 1:04:29.379
<i>I can't be both places
at the same time.</i>

1:04:29.413 --> 1:04:31.551
And it seems like that's what
Parker expects every day.

1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:36.172
<i>Jordan's truck
reaches the yard.</i>

1:04:36.206 --> 1:04:39.793
If it's not one thing
around here,
it's usually ten things more.

1:04:41.586 --> 1:04:43.965
<i>Every hour it's down
makes it harder</i>

1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:47.275
<i>for Tyson to hit Parker's
30-day deadline.</i>

1:04:47.310 --> 1:04:48.689
Whoa!

1:04:48.724 --> 1:04:50.896
What is going on down here?

1:04:52.551 --> 1:04:54.241
First, we have to try
and get rid of some mud

1:04:54.275 --> 1:04:56.137
so we can actually
get to the bolts.

1:05:07.448 --> 1:05:09.413
Really not what we're
wanting to see down here.

1:05:09.448 --> 1:05:12.793
This hydraulic pump completely
encased with this, well,

1:05:12.827 --> 1:05:16.241
pretty much mammoth
This stuff is like
concrete here.

1:05:16.275 --> 1:05:17.586
It flowed in as a liquid.

1:05:17.620 --> 1:05:21.344
Well, it set back up
and this stuff,
it's brutally hard here.

1:05:21.379 --> 1:05:23.517
You can barely bust it apart.

1:05:23.551 --> 1:05:28.586
<i>The hydraulic pumps
power the truck's suspension,
brakes and steering.</i>

1:05:28.620 --> 1:05:31.517
<i>Without them,
the truck is useless.</i>

1:05:31.551 --> 1:05:35.275
<i>Mechanic Taylor must remove
them and assess the damage.</i>

1:05:40.655 --> 1:05:42.586
We know the pumps
not building pressure.

1:05:42.620 --> 1:05:45.620
You can see damage
on the plate here.

1:05:47.517 --> 1:05:50.241
We'll take
the guts out of this one,
and we'll have a look.

1:05:53.448 --> 1:05:57.275
More than likely the pistons--
The pistons or the slippers
are toast.

1:05:57.310 --> 1:06:01.379
You can see here these
grooves in here are why we're
not building any pressure.

1:06:01.413 --> 1:06:03.137
The oil can just go
wherever it wants.

1:06:03.172 --> 1:06:06.517
It's not forced through
the output ports.

1:06:06.551 --> 1:06:11.965
<i>Mud Mountain's
fine black silt has worked
its way inside the pump,</i>

1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:16.379
<i>breaking the pistons
and damaging the precision
engineered plate</i>

1:06:16.413 --> 1:06:19.689
<i>that seals in
the hydraulic fluid.</i>

1:06:19.724 --> 1:06:23.103
Okay, um, there's
a curve ball.

1:06:23.137 --> 1:06:26.965
<i>Getting a spare up
to the claim could take weeks.</i>

1:06:29.586 --> 1:06:30.862
Man,
the only other thing

1:06:30.896 --> 1:06:34.758
I'm wondering here we could
do and try in the meantime.

1:06:34.793 --> 1:06:38.551
So if we can get
this to all look like
this outer portion here...

1:06:38.586 --> 1:06:39.689
Yeah.

1:06:39.724 --> 1:06:42.000
...and maybe with
the new pistons here,

1:06:42.034 --> 1:06:44.689
and if we can get
this flat again.

1:06:44.724 --> 1:06:47.344
<i>Without a working
seal from the top plate,</i>

1:06:47.379 --> 1:06:52.379
<i>the pump leaks hydraulic
fluid and is unable to
gain pressure.</i>

1:06:52.413 --> 1:06:57.965
<i>Mitch's Hail Mary bush fix,
remove and replace
the damaged pistons,</i>

1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:02.965
<i>then take the top plate
and grind out the
grooves to create a seal</i>

1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:06.862
<i>so the pump can regain
pressure and power the truck.</i>

1:07:15.689 --> 1:07:21.413
So we've polished up
this piece here, so
hopefully this will seal.

1:07:21.448 --> 1:07:24.689
This will make pressure.
And if it does, this
truck can go back to work.

1:07:24.724 --> 1:07:26.827
If not, we're gonna be
waiting for a new part.

1:07:28.344 --> 1:07:30.310
I'm gonna roll the dice on
this thing. See if she works.

1:07:30.344 --> 1:07:31.724
100%.

1:07:48.103 --> 1:07:50.103
We just got to fire it up
and see if it works.

1:07:50.137 --> 1:07:51.206
You ready?

1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:54.965
- You ready?
Yeah.

1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:56.344
Here we go.

1:07:59.034 --> 1:08:00.655
Come on, baby.

1:08:11.896 --> 1:08:13.586
We just need our pump
to build enough pressure

1:08:13.620 --> 1:08:16.620
to raise the machine
all the way up to the top.

1:08:16.655 --> 1:08:19.379
Before we took it out,
it wasn't building
any pressure.

1:08:23.068 --> 1:08:24.931
100% lift.

1:08:28.068 --> 1:08:30.586
- There it is, buddy.
- How about that!

1:08:31.655 --> 1:08:33.482
You know, we've been
working on trucks all day,

1:08:33.517 --> 1:08:36.896
but this is the last
one right here heading
back out to the cut,

1:08:36.931 --> 1:08:38.517
and everything's
good to go again.

1:08:38.551 --> 1:08:40.000
Hopefully, it lasts a while.

1:08:41.344 --> 1:08:44.137
<i>With the full
fleet back in action,</i>

1:08:44.172 --> 1:08:48.862
<i>Tyson has a fighting chance
to hit Parker's deadline.</i>

1:08:48.896 --> 1:08:50.793
Hey, Jordan, yeah, it's good
to see you're back, man.

1:08:50.827 --> 1:08:54.586
You know, we need every
truck going here at
Mud Mountain we can get.

1:08:54.620 --> 1:08:57.413
That's one step
closer to getting me
the hell out of the mud

1:08:57.448 --> 1:09:01.413
and back around a wash plant
in my happy place.

1:09:18.068 --> 1:09:19.965
How's it going, guys?

1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:22.931
Hey, Fred.
- How you doing?

1:09:22.965 --> 1:09:27.620
<i>Fred Lewis'
chances of getting gold
rest on striking a deal</i>

1:09:27.655 --> 1:09:33.586
<i>with Paul and Diana Phillips
to mine their pre-stripped
claims in Clear Creek.</i>

1:09:33.620 --> 1:09:34.931
How'd it go?

1:09:34.965 --> 1:09:36.379
I got all my testing done

1:09:36.413 --> 1:09:39.241
and I'm seeing
the exact type of gold
that you guys told me.

1:09:39.275 --> 1:09:41.413
It's consistent throughout
the valley, like you said.

1:09:43.965 --> 1:09:46.034
So what are you guys
looking at for a royalty?

1:09:49.931 --> 1:09:54.896
It's probably the easiest
ground you'll ever find
to mine, go about 50%.

1:09:56.172 --> 1:09:57.517
50%?

1:10:00.862 --> 1:10:02.724
I never heard of that before.

1:10:02.758 --> 1:10:04.827
Did a lot of time on that,
and all you got to do is

1:10:04.862 --> 1:10:07.344
just pick up the dirt
and throw it in the plant.

1:10:07.379 --> 1:10:14.068
<i>Giving up 50% of
every ounce of gold could make
this lean ground a loss maker.</i>

1:10:14.103 --> 1:10:17.379
To be able to give my
guys their gold bonus
at the end of the year,

1:10:17.413 --> 1:10:18.931
so they're not
working for free,

1:10:18.965 --> 1:10:21.965
that coupled with
last season's loss,

1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:26.448
I'm not sure that the 50%--
Well, I know the 50% is--

1:10:26.482 --> 1:10:30.241
is something I just can't...
I can't bite on.

1:10:30.275 --> 1:10:33.344
This ground here is
already set up, stripped
and ready to mine.

1:10:35.344 --> 1:10:37.137
- We can't give it away, Fred.
- I know.

1:10:37.172 --> 1:10:39.275
- We can't.
- And that's my...
That's it right there.

1:10:41.896 --> 1:10:46.896
But it's still below that line
where I told myself
and my entire team,

1:10:46.931 --> 1:10:49.068
"I won't bite unless
I find this for you."

1:10:50.655 --> 1:10:52.172
If I'm being
painstakingly obvious,

1:10:52.206 --> 1:10:55.206
I don't feel like there's a...

1:10:55.241 --> 1:10:58.068
there's a ground that
we're gonna come to
that both of us are happy on.

1:10:59.724 --> 1:11:01.310
It's just not
a good option for us.

1:11:04.620 --> 1:11:06.551
- Thank you very much.
- Thanks for stopping by, Fred.

1:11:06.586 --> 1:11:08.137
Thanks, Fred.

1:11:08.172 --> 1:11:09.517
- I'll talk to you guys. Yep.
- Take care.

1:11:13.827 --> 1:11:18.103
50%? There's no way
I can make 50% work.

1:11:20.827 --> 1:11:22.413
What do you think?

1:11:22.448 --> 1:11:27.068
You know, Paul,
no miner has the opportunity
to walk in on ground

1:11:27.103 --> 1:11:30.689
that's already stripped,
ponds in place,

1:11:30.724 --> 1:11:34.448
<i>literally bring your machines
in and start sluicing.</i>

1:11:34.482 --> 1:11:37.275
<i>Once everything's
all hooked up.
I mean, it's very rare.</i>

1:11:37.310 --> 1:11:38.931
It doesn't happen that often.

1:11:41.724 --> 1:11:43.172
<i>He made it
sound so easy.</i>

1:11:43.206 --> 1:11:45.034
<i>But, you know,
if it sounds
too good to be true,</i>

1:11:45.068 --> 1:11:46.896
<i>it probably is.</i>

1:11:46.931 --> 1:11:49.241
Really sucks, because
I had my hopes up.

1:11:49.275 --> 1:11:52.000
<i>And it's not just give me
some ground, let's go dig.</i>

1:11:52.034 --> 1:11:54.379
The very minimum is I've got
to put money into the company

1:11:54.413 --> 1:11:57.793
and my guys' pockets,
or we're a failure.

1:11:57.827 --> 1:11:59.586
I'm pretty much
back to square one.

1:12:12.275 --> 1:12:15.241
The best part is we fired up
my first week here, you know.

1:12:15.275 --> 1:12:17.586
We're already washing
the rocks,
so that's pretty sweet.

1:12:17.620 --> 1:12:19.344
<i>Let's hope there's a whole
load of gold in here.</i>

1:12:20.793 --> 1:12:23.793
<i>Rick Ness and his
bare bones three-person crew</i>

1:12:23.827 --> 1:12:26.103
<i>are gunning for 2,000 ounces,</i>

1:12:26.137 --> 1:12:30.379
<i>banking on a fast start
sluicing Creek Cut pay dirt.</i>

1:12:30.413 --> 1:12:32.586
Shut it down.

1:12:32.620 --> 1:12:34.965
<i>After three
days of washing rocks,</i>

1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:37.655
<i>it's time for the first
cleanup of the season.</i>

1:12:38.724 --> 1:12:40.655
I don't know why
I'm so nervous.

1:12:40.689 --> 1:12:42.379
It's the first
one of the year. I--

1:12:42.413 --> 1:12:43.448
You seem a little giddy.

1:12:43.482 --> 1:12:44.965
I am.

1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:46.517
All right,
I can't talk anymore.
I got to go look--

1:12:46.551 --> 1:12:48.413
Let's do this.
Let's make it rain, boys.
Whoo!

1:12:54.517 --> 1:12:56.689
Yeah, look at that pile
right there, Brennan.

1:12:56.724 --> 1:12:58.310
- Yeah.
- Look at them all there.

1:12:58.344 --> 1:13:00.137
Yeah, buddy.
yeah.

1:13:02.068 --> 1:13:04.034
Oh, there's one.
Look at that, buddy.

1:13:05.689 --> 1:13:07.586
Look at that
nugget right there.

1:13:08.931 --> 1:13:10.482
Oh, buddy.

1:13:10.517 --> 1:13:11.758
It looked really good.

1:13:13.068 --> 1:13:15.758
Oh!

1:13:17.310 --> 1:13:18.724
Holy [bleep], man.

1:13:22.482 --> 1:13:24.482
- Does it feel like the
first time again?

1:13:24.517 --> 1:13:25.931
It does.

1:13:25.965 --> 1:13:27.758
Look at these chunks
coming out of there.

1:13:27.793 --> 1:13:29.655
It's amazing.

1:13:29.689 --> 1:13:32.551
Pretty excited, like,
we had a big fat
first clean up.

1:13:32.586 --> 1:13:34.413
You know, this is gonna make
everybody feel pretty good

1:13:34.448 --> 1:13:38.206
for the season and what we're
having to look forward to.

1:13:38.241 --> 1:13:40.896
I hate to make guesses,
and I won't, but I will
say that it looks good.

1:13:40.931 --> 1:13:44.103
It looks really good, like,
some of the best I've
seen in that box, so.

1:13:50.551 --> 1:13:52.068
I see some gold in that pan.

1:13:52.103 --> 1:13:53.655
A lot of gold actually, right?

1:13:53.689 --> 1:13:55.137
You know, the cleanup
looked really good.

1:13:55.172 --> 1:13:57.034
Yeah, it does look good.

1:13:57.068 --> 1:14:00.172
And actually, I mean,
that being said,

1:14:00.206 --> 1:14:01.310
why don't we just
weigh this out?

1:14:01.344 --> 1:14:03.034
Let's do this.
- Sounds good.

1:14:03.068 --> 1:14:09.241
<i>To his 2,000 ounce
season goal, Rick needs
around 100 ounces a week,</i>

1:14:09.275 --> 1:14:13.482
<i>so this 3-day run
needs to deliver at least 50.</i>

1:14:13.517 --> 1:14:19.620
5, 10, 20, 30,

1:14:19.655 --> 1:14:22.689
40, 50,

1:14:23.862 --> 1:14:27.103
60. What...

1:14:27.137 --> 1:14:29.275
67.50.

1:14:29.310 --> 1:14:30.689
- Buddy.
- Oh, man!

1:14:30.724 --> 1:14:31.862
How does that feel, huh?

1:14:31.896 --> 1:14:33.275
awesome.

1:14:34.931 --> 1:14:37.206
Well, that's evidence
of all our hard work
right there.

1:14:37.241 --> 1:14:38.965
Yeah.

1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:45.793
<i>At over $120,000,
Rick's pulled more gold
in his first three days</i>

1:14:45.827 --> 1:14:48.965
<i>than he did
in the first three weeks
last year.</i>

1:14:53.103 --> 1:14:55.241
Well, for now,
it's the four of us.

1:14:55.275 --> 1:14:57.827
Let's just keep doing
our thing, I mean,
that's a hell of a start.

1:14:57.862 --> 1:14:59.206
In all honesty,
the four of us,

1:14:59.241 --> 1:15:00.724
I mean, we work
really well together.

1:15:00.758 --> 1:15:02.310
Like, I'm impressed
with everybody.

1:15:02.344 --> 1:15:03.793
- That's good to hear.
- You know-- Yeah.

1:15:03.827 --> 1:15:07.034
You know, you stepped up
this year like you always do,
get us started.

1:15:07.068 --> 1:15:10.172
Brennan you showed right up,
jumped right in,
you know. Kruse.

1:15:10.206 --> 1:15:12.206
I mean, you know,
everybody pulled their weight

1:15:12.241 --> 1:15:13.758
and the results
are right here.

1:15:15.103 --> 1:15:16.551
Let's go get some dinner
and some sleep.

1:15:16.586 --> 1:15:17.655
Get back at it tomorrow.

1:15:17.689 --> 1:15:19.275
Yeah, buddy.
Sounds good.

1:15:19.310 --> 1:15:20.758
Eat, sleep, mine, bro.

1:15:22.241 --> 1:15:24.448
<i>Well, we definitely have
a good start to the season,</i>

1:15:24.482 --> 1:15:27.827
<i>but it's a long way to go
to 2,000 ounces.</i>

1:15:27.862 --> 1:15:31.068
So I'm not gonna jump the gun
and say this is gonna be easy,

1:15:31.103 --> 1:15:32.758
uh, but I've got
the right people here with me.

1:15:32.793 --> 1:15:35.793
We did the right prep work
over the offseason
and last fall,

1:15:35.827 --> 1:15:40.517
and we got a hell of a start,
so onward and upward.

1:15:50.068 --> 1:15:53.137
Find out if my little shack
is still livable.

1:15:55.172 --> 1:15:56.793
Let's go see what we got
going on here.

1:15:58.448 --> 1:16:00.000
I got water.

1:16:00.034 --> 1:16:01.793
Sounds like I got heat, too.

1:16:03.275 --> 1:16:04.448
Wow.

1:16:04.482 --> 1:16:06.586
Everybody's been
using my shower.

1:16:06.620 --> 1:16:11.689
Oh, hammer and chisel
and sand blast it,
and it'll be good as new.

1:16:11.724 --> 1:16:15.724
Somebody tried using
steel wool on it
to clean it up

1:16:15.758 --> 1:16:17.689
and left the steel wool
in the shower.

1:16:17.724 --> 1:16:19.000
That's always good.

1:16:19.034 --> 1:16:20.655
All right, I'm home.

1:16:20.689 --> 1:16:21.793
Let's go.

1:16:31.482 --> 1:16:34.379
This first segment
is almost done.
Once it's done,

1:16:34.413 --> 1:16:37.034
then we can move on
to the next piece.

1:16:37.068 --> 1:16:41.310
<i>Two weeks into
digging Mud Mountain,
Parker Schnabel's crew</i>

1:16:41.344 --> 1:16:45.000
<i>is 55 feet down
in the first half of the cut</i>

1:16:45.034 --> 1:16:48.931
<i>and pushing hard
to hit pay dirt
so they can find out just</i>

1:16:48.965 --> 1:16:50.758
<i>how rich the ground is.</i>

1:16:52.310 --> 1:16:54.551
Word on the street
is that at the bottom here,

1:16:54.586 --> 1:16:56.241
there's roughly 8,000 ounces.

1:16:56.275 --> 1:16:59.413
<i>When Parker told me that,
I said, "Okay,
so after we're done this,</i>

1:16:59.448 --> 1:17:00.758
we're going to Mexico, right?

1:17:00.793 --> 1:17:02.448
'Cause we've hit our goal.

1:17:02.482 --> 1:17:03.931
Or we've pretty much
topped what

1:17:03.965 --> 1:17:06.344
we've done every other year,"
and he's like, "Yeah,
exactly, Tyson,

1:17:06.379 --> 1:17:08.068
that's exactly
what we're gonna do."

1:17:08.103 --> 1:17:11.931
But I have a feeling
that's wishful
thinking on my behalf.

1:17:13.137 --> 1:17:14.724
Looks like there's some
bedrock.

1:17:16.448 --> 1:17:18.172
Hey, Mitch, Doumitt,

1:17:18.206 --> 1:17:19.413
do you guys got a copy?

1:17:19.448 --> 1:17:21.379
<i>Yeah, hey, Tyson, what's up?</i>

1:17:21.413 --> 1:17:23.413
Yeah, I think I hit pay gravel
down at Mud Mountain.

1:17:23.448 --> 1:17:24.965
You guys want to come down?

1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:27.000
<i>Oh, man, if you hit gravel
in Mud Mountain,</i>

1:17:27.034 --> 1:17:29.137
<i>there's gotta be pay.</i>

1:17:29.172 --> 1:17:30.379
Oh, yeah, it's pay.

1:17:31.655 --> 1:17:33.413
It's been such a tough week.

1:17:33.448 --> 1:17:36.482
We've been out here fighting,
struggling to keep these
rock trucks going.

1:17:36.517 --> 1:17:39.793
<i>Really excited to see
what's at the bottom of it
60 feet down.</i>

1:17:39.827 --> 1:17:42.689
We're gonna go out,
pan it up and, well,

1:17:42.724 --> 1:17:44.413
hopefully, the pans look
as good as the drilling.

1:17:46.793 --> 1:17:48.517
What do you think, Chris,
you ready to do this?

1:17:48.551 --> 1:17:49.931
You bring a gold pan?

1:17:49.965 --> 1:17:51.965
I know all you've been seeing
is nothing but mud out here.

1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:54.379
All we've been seeing
is nothing but broken
machines in the yard.

1:17:54.413 --> 1:17:55.689
So I'm ready to see some gold.

1:17:55.724 --> 1:17:57.103
How about you guys?

1:17:57.137 --> 1:17:59.689
Yeah, for sure.
Let me grab a pan.
We'll go wash this stuff up.

1:17:59.724 --> 1:18:04.620
<i>After moving
60 feet of overburden,
all Parker's hopes</i>

1:18:04.655 --> 1:18:09.862
<i>for the season rely
on a razor-thin pay layer
less than two feet thick.</i>

1:18:09.896 --> 1:18:11.413
Let's see what we got here.

1:18:16.103 --> 1:18:17.655
I wasn't expecting that.

1:18:17.689 --> 1:18:19.413
What do you got over there?

1:18:19.448 --> 1:18:20.724
A couple flakes.

1:18:20.758 --> 1:18:21.862
What do you got Chris?

1:18:21.896 --> 1:18:23.344
Not a hell of a lot,
though.

1:18:23.379 --> 1:18:24.586
Not even a flake.

1:18:30.655 --> 1:18:32.931
Well, we're gonna
need to show this Parker.

1:18:32.965 --> 1:18:34.103
Yeah.

1:18:35.862 --> 1:18:38.862
We've definitely
invested a lot of money,
tore up a lot of machines,

1:18:38.896 --> 1:18:42.827
and what I'm seeing here
looks like

1:18:46.103 --> 1:18:50.000
<i>Parker is already
$700,000 in the hole,</i>

1:18:50.034 --> 1:18:54.103
<i>and the first pans
of Mud Mountain are duds.</i>

1:18:58.275 --> 1:18:59.655
How's it going?
How are you doing?

1:18:59.689 --> 1:19:01.137
Hey, Parker.
- I'm all right.

1:19:01.172 --> 1:19:02.586
Getting in
the swing of things.

1:19:02.620 --> 1:19:04.034
What are you guys up to?

1:19:04.068 --> 1:19:06.172
We got a little bit of
a problem, I think, maybe.

1:19:06.206 --> 1:19:07.275
What kind of problem?

1:19:07.310 --> 1:19:09.379
Well, we've been down at
Mud Mountain panning.

1:19:09.413 --> 1:19:11.620
Our best pan had two colors.

1:19:14.896 --> 1:19:16.344
It doesn't make me feel good.

1:19:16.379 --> 1:19:18.344
It makes me a bit nervous,
actually.

1:19:20.758 --> 1:19:24.275
You'd think with
how concentrated
the material is down there,

1:19:24.310 --> 1:19:27.103
and you'd think you'd
at least see something, but...

1:19:27.137 --> 1:19:29.379
It's not like we're just--
It's not like
we're just going off

1:19:29.413 --> 1:19:32.137
of a gut feeling
like Liam drilled that.

1:19:32.172 --> 1:19:33.344
What can we do about it?

1:19:33.379 --> 1:19:34.482
Yeah. You can't.

1:19:34.517 --> 1:19:35.793
I mean, you got the money
invested in it.

1:19:35.827 --> 1:19:36.965
We're going to sluice it,
right?

1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:38.241
There's nothing
we can do about it now.

1:19:39.793 --> 1:19:41.931
We've got to trust something
and we've got
to trust somebody.

1:19:41.965 --> 1:19:43.413
Yeah.

1:19:43.448 --> 1:19:46.241
You're either gonna come
out of this, and we're all
going to be smiling

1:19:46.275 --> 1:19:47.965
and everything's
gonna be good,

1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:50.620
or it's gonna be
a big learning experience so.

1:19:50.655 --> 1:19:53.413
Yeah, I mean,
it's definitely
a pretty big gamble,

1:19:53.448 --> 1:19:55.137
especially with
how deep it is.

1:19:55.172 --> 1:19:56.620
And if it mines the way
it drilled,

1:19:56.655 --> 1:19:58.448
we're gonna have
a hell of a season

1:19:58.482 --> 1:20:01.034
and should be able to beat
last year, for sure.

1:20:01.068 --> 1:20:02.310
All right, well...

1:20:02.344 --> 1:20:04.068
We'll get it through
a wash plant and
see what we end up with.

1:20:04.103 --> 1:20:05.379
Thanks, Parker.
- Thanks, guys.

1:20:17.827 --> 1:20:20.241
<i>In the Beets Family
gold room...</i>

1:20:20.275 --> 1:20:22.965
We started sluicing everything
from the Nugget Cut.

1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:24.931
I don't know how much T Beets
was expecting,

1:20:24.965 --> 1:20:27.965
but from what I see,
and I do think we'll have

1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:29.689
at least a little bit
of gold in there.

1:20:32.965 --> 1:20:35.275
At the end of this week,
Mom and I are heading

1:20:35.310 --> 1:20:38.206
600 kilometers away
to have a baby.

1:20:38.241 --> 1:20:41.379
We're just really not set up
here in the Yukon

1:20:41.413 --> 1:20:43.689
to have babies anywhere
except for Whitehorse.

1:20:45.172 --> 1:20:48.655
Working for my family,
I'll be able
to bring my child in

1:20:48.689 --> 1:20:49.931
and continue working.

1:20:49.965 --> 1:20:54.931
She'll be in
a playpen over by...
probably the table

1:20:54.965 --> 1:20:59.655
because that's a peaceful
noise to listen to.

1:20:59.689 --> 1:21:01.448
It is an exciting thing,
but...

1:21:06.448 --> 1:21:08.137
<i>It's the moment of truth.</i>

1:21:08.172 --> 1:21:14.034
<i>The Beets family's first
gold weigh of their ambitious
9,000 ounce season.</i>

1:21:15.689 --> 1:21:16.965
Hi, folks.
- Hi.

1:21:20.620 --> 1:21:23.034
That thing runs
basically a day on
a half a tank.

1:21:23.068 --> 1:21:25.310
I see what the 11 does.
It's like, "What the [bleep]?"

1:21:27.586 --> 1:21:29.689
Why do we have two jars?

1:21:29.724 --> 1:21:31.896
Well, I figured it,
it's called the Nugget Cut,

1:21:31.931 --> 1:21:35.000
so I kept all the nuggets out
and we'll put them on top.

1:21:38.103 --> 1:21:41.206
Roughly 40, 45.

1:21:41.241 --> 1:21:48.137
<i>To hit his 9,000
ounce target, Tony needs
475 ounces a week,</i>

1:21:48.172 --> 1:21:52.379
<i>so this 2-day run
should deliver 160 ounces.</i>

1:21:53.689 --> 1:21:55.103
Are you gonna pour
some gold for us?

1:21:55.137 --> 1:21:59.103
5, 6, 14, 15, 18, 25,

1:21:59.137 --> 1:22:05.379
40, 50, 70, 80.44.

1:22:08.689 --> 1:22:10.896
82.72.

1:22:12.068 --> 1:22:17.000
<i>82 ounces is
worth over $147,000.</i>

1:22:25.586 --> 1:22:27.103
Yeah.

1:22:27.137 --> 1:22:30.655
<i>It's more than
the trommel produced
per hour last season,</i>

1:22:30.689 --> 1:22:36.137
<i>but still less than
the 475 ounces
a week they need.</i>

1:22:36.172 --> 1:22:38.448
Well, this will be your last
gold weigh for a while.

1:22:38.482 --> 1:22:40.758
Well, I mean, only if you
don't have somebody else

1:22:40.793 --> 1:22:41.827
cleaning the gold
while I'm gone.

1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:45.068
Oh, yeah.

1:22:45.103 --> 1:22:47.103
She needs a job
like a hole in her head.

1:22:51.448 --> 1:22:53.827
Well, then you're gonna have
to buy a playpen

1:22:53.862 --> 1:22:56.482
and maybe a mobile
and maybe an
white noise machine.

1:22:56.517 --> 1:22:57.862
I need a humidifier.

1:23:00.620 --> 1:23:02.413
Clean it up,
and let's go to work.

1:23:02.448 --> 1:23:04.827
- Yeah.
- I have stuff to do, too,
so please.

1:23:06.379 --> 1:23:07.862
Bye.

1:23:10.517 --> 1:23:14.034
<i>Now, Tony can
expand to the Indian River</i>

1:23:14.068 --> 1:23:17.827
<i>and easily double or even
triple his output.</i>

1:23:21.724 --> 1:23:23.310
The water license,
as you know,

1:23:23.344 --> 1:23:25.275
as long as we get it
in the next 14 days,

1:23:25.310 --> 1:23:26.724
<i>that's good.</i>

1:23:26.758 --> 1:23:30.275
We should have both operations
up and running.

1:23:30.310 --> 1:23:33.586
With all that, I think
we should be able to
reach the goal.
