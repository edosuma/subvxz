- Abby: Ha ha ha!
- Alan: Julia, these are

01:17.166 --> 01:18.900
the shapes that we're
trying to find, OK?

01:18.900 --> 01:21.867
All right? Yeah. It's gonna
be so much fun.

01:21.867 --> 01:24.033
We can win, too.
Oh. Hey. Check it out.

01:24.033 --> 01:26.333
- Look who's here.
- Oh. Hello there.

01:26.333 --> 01:27.767
- Hey. Welcome
to Sesame Street.
- Hi.

01:27.767 --> 01:29.900
- Hey.
- We're getting ready
to play a game!

01:29.900 --> 01:31.100
That's right.

01:31.100 --> 01:32.500
- Game, game, game!
- Yeah.

01:32.500 --> 01:34.367
This game is called
a shape hunt.

01:34.367 --> 01:37.500
See? Each team
has a list of shapes.

01:37.500 --> 01:39.867
Mm-hmm, and then we
have to look around

01:39.867 --> 01:41.033
to find them.

01:41.033 --> 01:42.667
Oh, oh, oh!
I found them, I found them!

01:42.667 --> 01:45.300
They are right there
on that paper!

01:45.300 --> 01:47.266
No, Grover.
We have to find these shapes

01:47.266 --> 01:49.367
in something around us.

01:49.367 --> 01:52.066
Oh.
That sounds harder.

01:52.066 --> 01:55.900
Yeah. Me, uh--
me no see any shapes
around us.

01:55.900 --> 01:57.567
OK. Well, see,
that's why it's called

01:57.567 --> 01:59.233
a shape hunt,  Cookie.

01:59.233 --> 02:00.767
You have to look
very closely.

02:00.767 --> 02:03.500
Sometimes, shapes are
hidden right in front of you,

02:03.500 --> 02:05.400
and you have to find them.

02:05.400 --> 02:07.266
Well, you guys are lucky
because you have

02:07.266 --> 02:09.300
Julia on your team,

02:09.300 --> 02:11.266
and she's really good
at finding things.

02:11.266 --> 02:13.166
Oh, that's great
because the first team

02:13.166 --> 02:17.200
that finds all the shapes
on their list wins!

02:17.200 --> 02:18.567
Oh, boy,
oh, boy, oh, boy!

02:18.567 --> 02:20.300
- This going to be fun!
- Yeah!

02:20.300 --> 02:22.266
Play, play, play!

02:22.266 --> 02:23.500
On your marks...

02:23.500 --> 02:24.867
- get set...
- Yes.

02:24.867 --> 02:27.700
Go! Shape hunt!

02:27.700 --> 02:29.800
Find those shapes!

02:29.800 --> 02:31.166
Here we go, here we go.

02:31.166 --> 02:34.567
OK, guys. Let's find
the first shape on our list.

02:34.567 --> 02:36.900
Oh! I know that shape.
It's a square.

02:36.900 --> 02:38.467
Yep. That's right, Abby.

02:38.467 --> 02:41.000
You can tell because it has
1--uh-huh--

02:41.000 --> 02:44.233
2, 3, 4 sides

02:44.233 --> 02:46.467
that are all
the same size.

02:46.467 --> 02:47.934
Ha ha ha! All right.
So let's look

02:47.934 --> 02:51.533
around here and see
if we can find any squares.

02:51.533 --> 02:53.467
- OK. OK. Let's look.
- All right.

02:53.467 --> 02:54.467
OK, OK.

02:54.467 --> 02:56.166
Me gonna
check over here.

02:56.166 --> 02:59.433
OK. Let's see
what we got here.

02:59.433 --> 03:04.233
Oh! Oh, look!
Me found a shape.

03:04.233 --> 03:05.667
- All right!
- Look at this!

03:05.667 --> 03:07.467
- Hey!
- Yes, me did it.

03:07.467 --> 03:09.033
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa.

03:09.033 --> 03:11.500
Cook--cookie monster, no, no.
That is not a square.

03:11.500 --> 03:13.567
Yeah. Cookie,
that's a circle.

03:13.567 --> 03:15.567
Uh, yeah.
Me-- Me know it circle,

03:15.567 --> 03:18.333
but circle me favorite shape

03:18.333 --> 03:22.533
because it remind me
of cookie!

03:22.533 --> 03:24.033
Me getting hungry.

03:24.033 --> 03:26.467
Hey, buddy. Hey.
We're just gonna focus, OK?

03:26.467 --> 03:28.533
Let's focus on finding
a square.

03:28.533 --> 03:30.967
Oh. Look!
I found one.

03:30.967 --> 03:32.166
Chris:
Hey! You're right!

03:32.166 --> 03:33.767
That is a square!
Ha ha ha!

03:33.767 --> 03:36.266
Oh! Hey. Look. Another one!

03:36.266 --> 03:39.000
Oh, look.
There's even more squares.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.367
There's 1, and there's 1,
and there's 1.

03:42.367 --> 03:43.633
- Ha ha ha!
- Way to go, Abby.

03:43.633 --> 03:44.834
Hey. We did a great job.

03:44.834 --> 03:46.667
We found a lot of squares
around here.

03:46.667 --> 03:47.834
Isn't that great,
Cookie Monster?

03:47.834 --> 03:49.266
Wha? Oh, sorry.

03:49.266 --> 03:52.133
Uh, me no can think
of anything but this circle.

03:52.133 --> 03:56.533
Yeah. It look too much
like a cookie!

03:56.533 --> 03:59.600
Ahh, nom nom! Ohh! Ohh!

03:59.600 --> 04:01.734
OK, team.

04:01.734 --> 04:03.633
Now according
to our list,

04:03.633 --> 04:06.734
the first thing
we are looking for is this.

04:06.734 --> 04:08.233
The number 0.

04:08.233 --> 04:09.600
It's a circle.

04:09.600 --> 04:11.266
We're hunting
for shapes, remember?

04:11.266 --> 04:13.734
Oh, yeah. Ha ha.
I knew that.

04:13.734 --> 04:16.433
Now a circle is
a shape with no straight lines.

04:16.433 --> 04:20.734
It just has one line
that goes all the way around.

04:20.734 --> 04:22.433
All right. See if you
can find it.

04:22.433 --> 04:24.033
Ah. OK. OK.
All right?

04:25.600 --> 04:27.200
Circle!

04:27.200 --> 04:28.200
That's right, Julia.

04:28.200 --> 04:30.200
We are looking
for a circle.

04:30.200 --> 04:32.633
Circle, circle!

04:32.633 --> 04:34.867
You see a circle, Julia?
Where?

04:36.300 --> 04:38.533
Oh. The stop sign?

04:38.533 --> 04:40.333
Well, that's
another shape.

04:40.333 --> 04:45.700
See? It has 1, 2, 3 4,
5, 6, 7, 8 sides.

04:45.700 --> 04:48.000
Yes, and a shape
with 8 sides is called

04:48.000 --> 04:50.567
an eighterooni!

04:50.567 --> 04:53.066
- It's called an octagon.
- Oh, yeah. Right.

04:53.066 --> 04:55.367
Circle, circle, circle!
Ha ha!

04:55.367 --> 04:58.934
What? Oh! Wait.

04:58.934 --> 05:01.800
Julia, you're right.
There are lots of little circles

05:01.800 --> 05:03.734
hidden in the signpost.

05:03.734 --> 05:05.433
- Oh, yeah.
- I didn't even see those.

05:05.433 --> 05:08.633
Oh, and what cute,
little circles they are.

05:08.633 --> 05:09.900
- Wow.
- Ohh.

05:09.900 --> 05:11.900
Julia, you saw something
that we didn't see.

05:11.900 --> 05:13.300
Great job!

05:13.300 --> 05:15.433
You are good
at finding things.

05:15.433 --> 05:18.533
OK, guys.
Follow me this way! Come on!

05:18.533 --> 05:20.533
Come on, guys.
We have to find more shapes

05:20.533 --> 05:22.467
before the other team does.

05:22.467 --> 05:25.266
Come on!
Shape hunt! Come on!

05:25.266 --> 05:26.867
Shape hunt!

05:26.867 --> 05:28.200
Oh, ho ho! OK.
All right. OK.

05:28.200 --> 05:31.533
The next shape
we have to find is a rectangle.

05:31.533 --> 05:33.066
- OK.
- Wait-- Wait a minute.

05:33.066 --> 05:36.333
That shape look almost
the same as the last shape.

05:36.333 --> 05:37.734
Yeah, yeah,
but rectangles

05:37.734 --> 05:39.066
and squares are different.

05:39.066 --> 05:40.133
- That's right.

05:40.133 --> 05:41.967
Yeah, yeah.

05:41.967 --> 05:45.400
See, a rectangle
has 1, 2, 3, 4 sides

05:45.400 --> 05:46.800
- like a square.
- Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm.

05:46.800 --> 05:50.500
But a rectangle has
1...2... long sides

05:50.500 --> 05:53.233
and 1...2... short sides.

05:53.233 --> 05:55.767
- Oh, me get it.
- Hey, hey, Chris.

05:55.767 --> 05:57.467
Maybe we can find
rectangles in there!

05:57.467 --> 05:58.967
- Oh, OK.
- Ooh! In there.

05:58.967 --> 06:00.800
Everybody, look closely.

06:00.800 --> 06:02.133
- Let's do it.
- Go. Here we go.

06:02.133 --> 06:03.200
- Go, go.
- Rectangles.

06:03.200 --> 06:05.800
Ha ha ha!

06:05.800 --> 06:09.000
Ohh. Rectangle.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.467
Rectangle.

06:11.467 --> 06:14.266
All right! Ha ha ha!

06:14.266 --> 06:17.900
If there's any more--
Ohh!

06:17.900 --> 06:19.834
Both: Rectangle!

06:19.834 --> 06:21.567
- Oh! Ha ha!
- Yeah.

06:21.567 --> 06:23.133
It was here
the whole time.

06:23.133 --> 06:25.367
Yeah. Here
the whole time. Ha ha ha!

06:25.367 --> 06:28.500
Ooh, ooh!
Here another rectangle.

06:28.500 --> 06:32.200
Uh, no, no. No. That's
a circle, Cookie, again.

06:32.200 --> 06:33.400
But hey, listen,

06:33.400 --> 06:34.834
there are other rectangles.

06:34.834 --> 06:37.667
Hey, hey. Over there.
Ha ha ha! Right there.

06:37.667 --> 06:39.033
Hey! And there.

06:39.033 --> 06:40.667
- Oh, me see it.
- Yeah, yeah.

06:40.667 --> 06:42.000
Yeah. All over there.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.400
That is great, Chris!

06:43.400 --> 06:45.667
We found all the rectangles.

06:45.667 --> 06:47.533
Yeah, and so fast, too.

06:47.533 --> 06:49.900
Look at the time. Time.

06:49.900 --> 06:53.734
Uh, where did
the clock go?

06:53.734 --> 06:57.900
Ahh. Cookie, did you
eat that circle, too?

07:00.567 --> 07:02.967
Maybe.

07:02.967 --> 07:04.533
Alan: Come on, guys!

07:04.533 --> 07:06.367
Hey. We're doing great
on this shape hunt,

07:06.367 --> 07:07.734
but we have to be fast.

07:07.734 --> 07:09.633
- Come on.
- Yeah, yeah.

07:09.633 --> 07:11.100
- OK.
- Come on, guys.

07:11.100 --> 07:13.834
And the next shape
we have to find is...

07:13.834 --> 07:16.233
Ah! That pointy guy
right there.

07:16.233 --> 07:18.667
- It's called a triangle...
- Oh, yeah. Ha ha ha!

07:18.667 --> 07:20.500
And it's got
1, 2, 3 sides.

07:20.500 --> 07:23.500
Do not worry.
I shall find this one.

07:23.500 --> 07:25.834
Let's see.
Triangle, triangle.

07:25.834 --> 07:27.100
All right.
There's got to be one

07:27.100 --> 07:29.033
somewhere in this store.

07:29.033 --> 07:30.467
Let's look closely, Julia.

07:30.467 --> 07:31.800
Triangle.

07:31.800 --> 07:34.633
What

07:34.633 --> 07:36.200
This is a rectangle.

07:36.200 --> 07:38.367
Triangle, triangle!

07:38.367 --> 07:41.400
Oh, and those are squares,
Julia, you see?

07:41.400 --> 07:43.367
Triangle, triangle!

07:43.367 --> 07:45.900
All right. Yeah.
A triangle has 3 sides.

07:45.900 --> 07:47.633
Well, I have looked,
and I am sorry

07:47.633 --> 07:49.667
to say this, Alan, but there are
simply no triangles

07:49.667 --> 07:51.934
in this entire store.

07:51.934 --> 07:53.834
Triangle!

07:56.000 --> 07:59.400
Ohh! Oh, I see them,
Julia.

07:59.400 --> 08:02.767
Lots of triangles
hidden in the pattern.

08:02.767 --> 08:04.734
How did you
ever find those?

08:04.734 --> 08:06.266
That is amazing.

08:06.266 --> 08:07.400
Look at that.

08:07.400 --> 08:08.767
Julia, you are
seeing shapes

08:08.767 --> 08:09.934
that we didn't see.

08:09.934 --> 08:11.333
Way to go!

08:11.333 --> 08:14.000
Abby:
Oh, boy! So close.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.200
Guys, we are down
to our last shape,

08:16.200 --> 08:17.767
but this one's gonna
be tricky.

08:17.767 --> 08:19.066
Check it out, check it out.

08:19.066 --> 08:21.233
OK. It's called
a rhombus.

08:22.600 --> 08:23.934
- Rhombus.

08:23.934 --> 08:25.166
Well, I never heard
of that shape before.

08:25.166 --> 08:26.500
Yeah. That one
look a lot like

08:26.500 --> 08:27.700
the other ones.

08:27.700 --> 08:28.800
Well, it's true.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.033
A rhombus does have

08:30.033 --> 08:34.533
1, 2, 3, 4 sides,

08:34.533 --> 08:36.667
like a square or a rectangle,

08:36.667 --> 08:38.667
but look closely.

08:38.667 --> 08:41.266
- A rhombus is tilted.

08:41.266 --> 08:43.033
Oh, boy. Well,
where are we gonna

08:43.033 --> 08:44.667
find a rhombus?

08:44.667 --> 08:46.900
I don't know, Abby,
but it's the last shape

08:46.900 --> 08:48.800
on our list,
so we better hurry!

08:48.800 --> 08:49.867
Yeah, yeah.
Let's go find the rhombus!

08:49.867 --> 08:51.667
Where rhombus

08:51.667 --> 08:52.867
Hey, guys.
They're almost done

08:52.867 --> 08:54.100
with their list.

08:54.100 --> 08:55.333
Quick. What is
our last shape?

08:55.333 --> 08:58.233
Oh! Ooh. It's a tough one,
a pentagon.

08:58.233 --> 08:59.367
It's a shape with

08:59.367 --> 09:02.533
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 sides.

09:02.533 --> 09:04.066
Oh, come on!

09:04.066 --> 09:05.633
That is way too hard.

09:05.633 --> 09:07.700
We are never going
to find a pentagon.

09:07.700 --> 09:09.367
No way, no way, no way.

09:09.367 --> 09:11.200
- Pentagon.
- No way.

09:11.200 --> 09:12.734
You see a pentagon,
Julia?

09:12.734 --> 09:13.934
Pentagon.

09:13.934 --> 09:15.033
Oh, this here? No.

09:15.033 --> 09:16.834
This is a fire hydrant, Julia.

09:16.834 --> 09:20.934
Yeah. We are not looking
for a hydrant shape on our list.

09:20.934 --> 09:24.000
I don't believe it. Look!

09:24.000 --> 09:25.367
Ha ha ha!

09:25.367 --> 09:26.734
Oh! Look at that!

09:26.734 --> 09:30.967
It is a teeny, tiny pentagon.

09:30.967 --> 09:33.400
Julia, you did it!
You found the last shape!

09:33.400 --> 09:36.133
We won the shape hunt! Ha ha!

09:36.133 --> 09:37.834
Whoo-hoo! Yes!

09:37.834 --> 09:40.000
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah!

09:40.000 --> 09:41.967
Man, you guys found
your last shape!

09:41.967 --> 09:44.200
Yep, all thanks
to Julia here.

09:44.200 --> 09:46.533
- She found every shape.
- Wow!

09:46.533 --> 09:48.200
- Mm-hmm.
- Nice work, Julia.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.033
Hey, hey, hey.
Congratulations, guys.

09:50.033 --> 09:52.867
You know, we just got stuck
on our very last shape.

09:52.867 --> 09:55.166
Check it out. A rhombus.

09:55.166 --> 09:57.667
Yeah. We couldn't find
a rhombus anywhere.

09:57.667 --> 09:59.667
Ha ha!
- What a funny shape.

09:59.667 --> 10:03.367
I have never seen a rhombus
before in my life. Ha ha ha!

10:03.367 --> 10:06.266
- Oh, rhombus!

10:06.266 --> 10:08.467
I think Julia knows
where a rhombus is.

10:08.467 --> 10:10.533
- Hey!
- Come on, you guys.

10:10.533 --> 10:12.800
Rhombus,
rhombus, rhombus.

10:12.800 --> 10:14.233
Oh, ho ho ho!

10:14.233 --> 10:15.567
I don't understand.

10:15.567 --> 10:19.467
Those all look like
diamonds to me, not a rhombus.

10:19.467 --> 10:21.867
Yeah. Well, actually,
Abby, the real name

10:21.867 --> 10:24.367
for a diamond shape
is a rhombus.

10:24.367 --> 10:26.367
- Ha ha ha!
- No way!

10:26.367 --> 10:27.867
- Whoa!
- It's a diamond.

10:27.867 --> 10:29.667
Julia, it's amazing
that you see things

10:29.667 --> 10:31.166
that everybody else doesn't.

10:31.166 --> 10:34.400
Yeah. Julia can
find shapes everywhere.

10:34.400 --> 10:37.133
- Alan: That's right.
- Circle!

10:37.133 --> 10:39.900
Circle! Rectangle!

10:39.900 --> 10:43.100
Oh, oh! Square!
Uh, pentagon!

10:44.767 --> 10:46.800
Wow! If you look around
close enough,

10:46.800 --> 10:48.633
shapes really are
all around us.

10:48.633 --> 10:51.367
Yeah.
They sure are.

10:51.367 --> 10:52.633
Ahh. Ahh, nom nom nom!

10:52.633 --> 10:54.533
Come on! Cookie!

10:54.533 --> 10:56.266
Oh, boy.
Shapes delicious!

10:56.266 --> 10:57.600
Mmm. That rhombus yummy.

10:57.600 --> 10:59.166
- No, no, no!
- Cookie Monster.

10:59.166 --> 11:00.367
Ohh! Ohh!
Ha ha ha!

11:00.367 --> 11:02.700
Ohh, ohh. Nom nom.

11:04.166 --> 11:06.400

11:49.633 --> 11:51.567
Announcer: Hi, and welcome
to "The Letter 'S' Show,"

11:51.567 --> 11:52.600
where it's all about shapes,

11:52.600 --> 11:55.300
because "S" is for shapes.

11:55.300 --> 11:56.967
Just doing a little stretching,

11:56.967 --> 11:58.767
- and here we go.

11:58.767 --> 12:00.734
Starting off easy
with a circle.

12:00.734 --> 12:04.200
It's just one line
that goes all the way around.

12:04.200 --> 12:05.533
Perfect!

12:05.533 --> 12:07.166
- Now an oval.
- Audience: Ooh!

12:07.166 --> 12:09.633
Announcer: As you can see,
it's shaped like an egg.

12:09.633 --> 12:12.800
And here comes
the first tricky move.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.300
Yes, it's a triangle!

12:14.300 --> 12:18.333
That's a shape
with 3 sides. Wow!

12:18.333 --> 12:20.200
But "S" is not done,

12:20.200 --> 12:22.734
as she stretches herself
into a square.

12:22.734 --> 12:24.800
That's 4 equal sides.

12:24.800 --> 12:27.834
It's a tough move,
but "S" makes it look easy.

12:27.834 --> 12:30.867
And with just a slight tilt,
she becomes a rhombus.

12:30.867 --> 12:33.400
That also has 4 sides.

12:33.400 --> 12:35.533
What incredible control!

12:35.533 --> 12:37.200
Now a rectangle.

12:37.200 --> 12:39.066
That's still 4 sides--

12:39.066 --> 12:41.000
2 long and 2 short.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.567
How do you top that?

12:43.767 --> 12:45.200
With a pentagon!

12:45.200 --> 12:47.033
That's 5 sides.

12:47.033 --> 12:48.767
Beautifully done!

12:48.767 --> 12:51.734
She adds another side,
and now it's a hexagon.

12:51.734 --> 12:54.000
That has 6 sides!

12:57.533 --> 12:59.266
Yes! It's an octagon.

12:59.266 --> 13:01.333
That has 8 sides.

13:01.333 --> 13:03.333
What a great show!

13:03.333 --> 13:05.100
"S" is for shapes.

13:05.100 --> 13:06.600
Way to go, letter "S."

I got it, I got it!

13:32.133 --> 13:35.467
Hi! I would like
a breakfast made by monsters.

13:35.467 --> 13:37.900
Ooh! Well, you
called the right truck,

13:37.900 --> 13:39.266
because we are...

13:39.266 --> 13:42.333
Both:
Monster foodies!

13:42.333 --> 13:43.700
What I'd like for breakfast

13:43.700 --> 13:46.133
is food that's
round and flat, like a circle.

13:46.133 --> 13:47.834
It's my favorite shape.

13:47.834 --> 13:49.934
Could you help me, please?

13:49.934 --> 13:53.633
Oh, that easy.
Cookie round and flat.

13:53.633 --> 13:57.233
Um, a cookie's
not a breakfast food.

13:57.233 --> 13:58.467
- Uh-uh.

13:58.467 --> 13:59.700
That news to me.

13:59.700 --> 14:01.867
Ahh, nom! Ohh, nom nom nom!

14:01.867 --> 14:03.600
Ohh.
Nom nom nom nom.

14:03.600 --> 14:06.767
Oh, I know.
Pancakeys!

14:06.767 --> 14:09.700
Ooh!
That a good idea, Gonger.

14:09.700 --> 14:11.033
- Yeah!
- Pancakes are

14:11.033 --> 14:12.533
round and flat

14:12.533 --> 14:13.900
- like a circle.
- Yeah.

14:13.900 --> 14:15.333
Here the ingredients.

14:15.333 --> 14:17.767
Oh. And a bananananana?

14:17.767 --> 14:19.100
Yeah.
Banana. Right.

14:19.100 --> 14:21.266
- Mm-hmm.
- OK. There we go.

14:21.266 --> 14:23.667
And the maple syrup.

14:23.667 --> 14:26.867
- Oh, boy. Uh...

14:26.867 --> 14:29.367
- There no syrup.
!

14:29.367 --> 14:30.600
- Yeah.
- Ohh!

14:30.600 --> 14:34.033
We need to get
the fresh maple syrup!

14:34.033 --> 14:36.967
Ooh! You know where we get
maple syrup from?

14:36.967 --> 14:38.700
Uh, maple trees?

14:38.700 --> 14:40.266
- Yeah!

14:40.266 --> 14:41.600
- Me was kidding.
- I show you.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.100
Come on!

14:50.367 --> 14:53.533
Both:
To the maple farm!

14:56.500 --> 14:58.533
Cookie Monster: We're going
to the maple syrup farm!

15:02.700 --> 15:04.867
Cookie Monster:
Hello, Mrs. Farmer.

15:04.867 --> 15:06.333
We need maple syrup.

15:06.333 --> 15:07.967
Can you help us, please?

15:07.967 --> 15:09.700
Well, you monsters
came to the right place.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.266
This is where we make it!

15:11.266 --> 15:13.600
Oh! Do we have
to bring the whole tree home?

15:13.600 --> 15:17.233
No. This is only
the first step in making syrup.

15:17.233 --> 15:19.567
This is called a spile.

15:21.066 --> 15:23.100
It's drilled
into a maple tree.

15:28.300 --> 15:32.800
The sap in the tree
drains down this hose

15:32.800 --> 15:36.600
and fills up this tank.

15:36.600 --> 15:39.800
From there, the sap is
pumped into the sugar house.

15:42.533 --> 15:45.000
The sap is boiled.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.166
When it reaches
the right temperature,

15:47.166 --> 15:49.934
it's maple syrup.

15:49.934 --> 15:52.233
Then the syrup is poured
into bottles,

15:52.233 --> 15:53.467
and it's ready.

15:53.467 --> 15:55.467
How many bottles you need?

15:55.467 --> 15:57.400
Cookie Monster:
Uh, just 1, please.

15:57.400 --> 15:59.734
Thank you, Mrs. Farmer.

15:59.734 --> 16:02.100
We're taking maple syrup back!

16:04.100 --> 16:05.166
We got it!

16:05.166 --> 16:06.900
Time to make pancakes.

16:06.900 --> 16:09.600
Oh, yes!
Let's check the recipe.

16:11.033 --> 16:13.433
1 cup of flour.

16:13.433 --> 16:15.700
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah. Ooh!

16:15.700 --> 16:17.934
Some baking powder.

16:17.934 --> 16:20.100
Yeah.

16:20.100 --> 16:22.533
Oh, a cup of milk.

16:22.533 --> 16:25.166
Ahh. Ooh. Yes, yes.

16:25.166 --> 16:27.266
And an egg.

16:29.500 --> 16:33.333
Ooh! Well done, Cookie.
And a bit of oil.

16:34.834 --> 16:39.233
- Now mix.
- Yeah. Ohh, ayy, ohh!

16:39.233 --> 16:40.767
Mix it, mix it, mix it.

16:40.767 --> 16:43.734
Ooh! Now pour on the griddle.

16:43.734 --> 16:45.867
OK. Me on.

16:45.867 --> 16:48.066
Ooh. Hey, look at that.

16:48.066 --> 16:50.700
It turns round
all by itself.

16:50.700 --> 16:52.867
Yeah.

16:52.867 --> 16:56.100
Uh, me still
no see how banana

16:56.100 --> 16:58.367
can be round and flat.

16:58.367 --> 17:00.000
Watch.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.700
Ooh!
Nice banana slices.

17:02.700 --> 17:04.066
Thank you.

17:07.033 --> 17:10.734
Oh, yeah. Uh-huh.

17:10.734 --> 17:13.367
Yeah. Now 1 more. Ooh.

17:15.100 --> 17:17.867
Mmm. Yummy!

17:17.867 --> 17:19.367
Ooh! Hmm.

17:20.667 --> 17:22.433
It's ready!

17:22.433 --> 17:24.667
OK. Order up!

17:25.934 --> 17:27.834
Oh, ho! Ha ha!

17:27.834 --> 17:29.734
- Ah, yeah.
- Bye-bye, pancake!

17:29.734 --> 17:31.166
See ya!

17:31.166 --> 17:33.033
Oh, Cookie Monster.

17:33.033 --> 17:34.333
Yeah?

17:34.333 --> 17:36.500
I got this
nice for you.

17:36.500 --> 17:38.767
Oh, Gonger.

17:38.767 --> 17:41.667
Thank you. Mmm.

17:41.667 --> 17:44.333
Ahh! Mmm. Nom ohh ohh.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.066
Thank you, Cookie Monster
and Gonger,

17:49.066 --> 17:51.934
for my round, flat breakfast.

17:51.934 --> 17:54.333
Circles are my favorite shape.

17:54.333 --> 17:55.900

17:55.900 --> 17:57.033
Cookie Monster:

19:10.367 --> 19:13.200
in the shape of hexagons.

19:13.200 --> 19:15.567
There are 6 bees!

19:15.567 --> 19:19.300
Let's count the bees

wondering about today.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.600
Wait for it.

20:36.600 --> 20:39.667
Wai-ai-ait for it!

20:39.667 --> 20:42.266
Oh, ho ho ho! Shapes.

20:42.266 --> 20:44.967
- Hi, circle.
- Hi!

20:44.967 --> 20:47.300
- Hi, rhombus.
- Yo!

20:47.300 --> 20:49.100
Oh! Elmo loves shapes

20:49.100 --> 20:51.934
and wants to find out
more about them.

20:51.934 --> 20:55.433
Hey-ey! Let's ask
Elmo's friend Smartie.

20:55.433 --> 20:57.500
Let's call her together.

20:57.500 --> 21:00.200
Elmo and kids:
♪ Oh, Smartie! ♪

21:00.200 --> 21:02.166
( Smartie playing
"Elmo's Song" )

21:02.166 --> 21:05.734
- Hiya, Elmo.
- Oh! Hi, Smartie.

21:05.734 --> 21:07.066
Check out my screen!

21:07.066 --> 21:10.033
Each button is
a different shape!

21:10.033 --> 21:12.066
That's perfect, Smartie,
because Elmo

21:12.066 --> 21:14.700
wants to learn
all about shapes today!

21:14.700 --> 21:17.433
Well, what do we do
to learn something new?

21:17.433 --> 21:20.967
All:
We look it up!

21:20.967 --> 21:22.567
Here we go.

21:22.567 --> 21:25.433
Shapes are all around us!

21:25.433 --> 21:27.467
Look around,
and you can see shapes

21:27.467 --> 21:28.734
like circles,

21:28.734 --> 21:30.100
squares,

21:30.100 --> 21:32.367
and triangles.

21:32.367 --> 21:34.266
A stop sign has 8 sides.

21:34.266 --> 21:36.567
That's called an octagon.

21:36.567 --> 21:37.900
Shapes can even be put together

21:37.900 --> 21:39.300
to make other shapes.

21:39.300 --> 21:41.633
Like, these 2 squares
go together

21:41.633 --> 21:43.800
to make 1 rectangle.

21:43.800 --> 21:46.166
We can even use shapes
to play games,

21:46.166 --> 21:47.967
like hopscotch.

21:50.567 --> 21:54.867
All that info really rounds out
my knowledge about shapes.

21:54.867 --> 21:56.266
Rounds?
- Ha ha!

21:56.266 --> 21:57.900
See ya later, Elmo.

21:57.900 --> 21:59.800
Bye-bye, Smartie.
Thank you.

21:59.800 --> 22:04.800
Ha ha! Hey! That gives
Elmo an idea.

22:04.800 --> 22:07.500
Oh, ho. Let's play
a game together.

22:07.500 --> 22:10.567
Yeah-eah-eah!
Come on, come on. Ha ha!

22:13.734 --> 22:16.667
Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha!

22:16.667 --> 22:20.400
Ha ha! Can you help Elmo
find all the circles

22:20.400 --> 22:21.967
in this picture?

22:21.967 --> 22:24.233
Come on! Let's play.

22:24.233 --> 22:25.867
Boy:
I see circles!

22:25.867 --> 22:27.734
Girl:
Look out the window.

22:27.734 --> 22:31.633
Elmo:
Oh, yeah. The sun is shaped
like a circle.

22:31.633 --> 22:33.967
Let's find another circle.

22:33.967 --> 22:35.967
Girl #2:
Look on the table.

22:35.967 --> 22:39.300
Elmo:
Is this cereal box
shaped like a circle?

22:39.300 --> 22:42.367
Girl:
No. That's shaped
like a rectangle.

22:42.367 --> 22:44.033
Elmo:
How about this?

22:44.033 --> 22:46.667
Girl #2:
Yeah. That's a circle!

22:46.667 --> 22:48.700
Elmo:
Yeah! Are there
any more circles

22:48.700 --> 22:50.533
in the kitchen?

22:50.533 --> 22:53.633
Girl #3: I see one!
It goes tick-tock.

22:53.633 --> 22:55.200
Elmo:
Oh, yeah.

22:55.200 --> 22:57.800
The last circle is the clock.

22:57.800 --> 23:00.400
Thank you for helping
Elmo find the circles.

23:00.400 --> 23:01.567
Oh, ho ho ho!

23:01.567 --> 23:03.967
Boy, shapes are so cool!

23:03.967 --> 23:07.467
Oh, and that makes Elmo
wonder even more.

23:07.467 --> 23:09.834
Oh. Does Mr. Noodle
know about shapes?

23:09.834 --> 23:12.367
Oh, let's ask him.
Ha ha hee hee!

23:12.367 --> 23:14.934
♪ Hey, Mr. Noodle ♪

23:14.934 --> 23:17.600
Oh, ho ho!
It's Mr. Noodle's sister

23:17.600 --> 23:19.367
Ms. Noodle.

23:19.367 --> 23:21.400
Oh. Hi, Ms. Noodle.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.734
Ms. Noodle, Elmo was wondering

23:23.734 --> 23:25.600
can you show us
some shapes?

23:25.600 --> 23:28.400
- Kids: Yeah!

23:28.400 --> 23:30.967
Show us a triangle,
Ms. Noodle!

23:33.900 --> 23:35.567
Boy:
No, Ms. Noodle.

23:35.567 --> 23:37.934
Girl:
That's not a triangle.

23:37.934 --> 23:40.266
Elmo:
That's a really nice
picture frame, Ms. Noodle,

23:40.266 --> 23:43.367
but Elmo sees a rectangle.

23:43.367 --> 23:47.166
Yeah. A rectangle
has 4 sides.

23:47.166 --> 23:52.033
Elmo and kids:
1, 2, 3, 4.

23:52.033 --> 23:54.233
Boy:
Keep looking for a triangle.

23:54.233 --> 23:55.867
Girl:
You can do it!

23:58.166 --> 23:59.700
Kids:
No, Ms. Noodle.

23:59.700 --> 24:03.734
Elmo:
That sandwich is a square,
not a triangle.

24:05.734 --> 24:06.934
What's she doing?

24:09.400 --> 24:10.834
Oh, ho ho ho!

24:10.834 --> 24:12.800
Look what Ms. Noodle did!

24:12.800 --> 24:14.700
She made a triangle.

24:14.700 --> 24:16.066
Yeah, baby!
That's a triangle

24:16.066 --> 24:19.100
because it has 3 sides.

24:19.100 --> 24:22.033
Elmo and kids:
1, 2, 3.

24:22.033 --> 24:24.567
Yay, Ms. Noodle!
You did it!

24:24.567 --> 24:27.834
Elmo: Yay! Ms. Noodle
made 2 triangles

24:27.834 --> 24:30.767
out of 1 square.

24:30.767 --> 24:32.867
Great job, Ms. Noodle!

24:32.867 --> 24:35.266
Thank you for showing
us triangles.
