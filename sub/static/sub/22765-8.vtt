[Tina] <i>Previously,</i>
<i>on Marvel's</i> Runaways...

00:09.830 --> 00:11.920
Video is being funneled
to your parents' company.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.840
Well, we have to find
a way to get it.

00:13.920 --> 00:15.390
What should I do about the fact

00:15.470 --> 00:18.560
that my wife is sleeping
with another man?

00:18.640 --> 00:19.810
[Nico] <i>If they know</i>
<i>you saw the robes,</i>

00:19.890 --> 00:21.190
they know you got
down the staircase.

00:21.270 --> 00:23.030
They're getting rid of me!

00:23.110 --> 00:24.650
[Gert] <i>Molly, you're gonna</i>
<i>get through this,</i>

00:24.740 --> 00:26.410
but for now you have to go.

00:26.490 --> 00:28.450
What do you have
to be ashamed of?

00:28.540 --> 00:30.710
My relationship with Jonah.

00:30.790 --> 00:32.750
How about my mom's password?

00:32.840 --> 00:34.300
No, I told you,
I just... I guessed.

00:34.380 --> 00:35.840
No, you knew,

00:35.930 --> 00:38.060
and you're gonna
tell me how right now.

00:38.140 --> 00:39.220
He's a monster, Janet.

00:39.310 --> 00:40.520
And how do you think he'll react

00:40.600 --> 00:41.730
when I tell him I'm leaving him?

00:41.810 --> 00:42.860
I got this.

00:45.700 --> 00:48.160
You tricked me
into thinking you'd changed,
but you know what?

00:48.240 --> 00:50.710
[both grunting]

00:52.460 --> 00:53.880
Dad, don't!

[body thuds]

01:07.570 --> 01:10.200
[car alarm continues wailing]

01:10.290 --> 01:13.880
- He's barely breathing.
- Just hold on, Victor, please!

01:15.840 --> 01:18.550
Janet! Jesus, is he alive?

01:18.640 --> 01:19.890
I think so.

01:19.970 --> 01:21.020
Are you okay?

01:21.100 --> 01:23.940
Get out of here. Now.

01:24.020 --> 01:25.570
Chase, you are bleeding.

01:25.650 --> 01:27.400
Not as bad as you'll be
if you don't go!

01:27.490 --> 01:29.200
[Janet]
Hey! Hey! Chase!

[gasping]

02:02.310 --> 02:05.230
You may as well start talking.

02:05.310 --> 02:09.030
'Cause I'm not leaving here
till I get answers.

02:09.110 --> 02:11.120
Why you didn't go
to Amy's funeral.

02:11.200 --> 02:13.710
How you knew my mom's password.

02:13.790 --> 02:15.830
Anything else
you've been hiding from me?

02:17.000 --> 02:17.920
Okay.

02:20.220 --> 02:21.930
I'm gonna tell you everything,

02:22.010 --> 02:23.730
starting where it ended.

02:25.980 --> 02:28.570
- The night she died...
- [message tone]

02:28.650 --> 02:31.370
[Amy] <i>Hey, Alex, sorry I didn't</i>
<i>make it over tonight.</i>

02:31.450 --> 02:34.200
<i>Can you get out of the house,
meet me at Timely in 20?</i>

02:34.290 --> 02:37.040
<i>I really need to talk,</i>
<i>and you're the only person</i>
<i>who knows.</i>

02:38.800 --> 02:40.470
Knows what?

02:57.130 --> 02:59.250
The Minorus are already here.

03:01.050 --> 03:03.890
No doubt whatever this is,
Tina's involved.

03:12.070 --> 03:13.870
[Catherine] We don't know
the situation yet.

03:13.950 --> 03:15.330
It was just one text.

03:15.410 --> 03:16.870
One word.

03:16.960 --> 03:18.420
That's enough.

03:18.500 --> 03:20.840
The last time we got
a text with that message,

03:20.920 --> 03:22.890
the Hernandezes
were found in pieces.

03:25.140 --> 03:28.230
I should've done
something about that,
about <i>her</i> back then.

03:28.310 --> 03:30.480
Let's just keep it cool,

03:30.570 --> 03:32.950
Geoffrey, until we know
what's up.

03:35.080 --> 03:36.790
Oh, I know what's up.

03:36.870 --> 03:39.130
[Nico] So you had no idea
why Amy didn't come

03:39.210 --> 03:40.670
to the PRIDE meeting that night?

03:40.750 --> 03:42.090
Amy was older than us.

03:42.170 --> 03:44.180
Hanging out during PRIDE
meetings was tradition,

03:44.260 --> 03:45.470
but it was also lame.

03:45.560 --> 03:47.180
At a certain point,
it makes sense

03:47.270 --> 03:49.560
that she'd stop wanting to come.

03:49.650 --> 03:51.440
But that wasn't it.

03:51.530 --> 03:53.150
And you knew it?

03:55.030 --> 03:56.490
You're mad at me.

03:56.580 --> 03:58.040
I think you knew I would be,

03:58.120 --> 03:59.960
which is why it took you
two years to grow the balls

04:00.040 --> 04:01.710
- to tell me what happened!
- I'm telling you now,

04:01.800 --> 04:04.260
unless you don't want
to hear it!

04:04.340 --> 04:05.640
Let me at least explain myself

04:05.720 --> 04:07.100
before you lose your shit on me.

04:07.180 --> 04:08.640
Alex, there's no explanation

04:08.730 --> 04:10.480
that would justify you
having this information

04:10.560 --> 04:12.230
and just sitting on it,

04:12.320 --> 04:15.200
knowing that I can
barely stand to be alive!

04:16.990 --> 04:20.170
Thinking that I did something
or I missed something...

04:20.250 --> 04:22.420
I missed something!

04:22.500 --> 04:24.300
I'm the one
who should've seen it coming.

04:24.380 --> 04:27.010
I should've done more.
I should've stopped her.

04:29.890 --> 04:33.740
Tell me the rest,
and I'll let you know
if I agree.

04:36.410 --> 04:38.370
The first night I noticed
something was off,

04:38.450 --> 04:39.870
I was sitting right over there.

04:39.960 --> 04:43.300
Told our parents that we
were just studying, but...

04:43.380 --> 04:45.930
we were mostly just
playing <i>Battlefront.</i>

04:46.010 --> 04:47.720
We're never getting off Endor

04:47.810 --> 04:49.600
if you don't get
the speeder bike moving.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.770
It's my laptop's fault.
This thing is slow as hell.

04:51.850 --> 04:54.570
Wow, blaming the laptop
for my superior skills.

04:54.650 --> 04:56.490
Lucky for you, I got a new pass

04:56.570 --> 04:58.030
on an antivirus software.

04:58.120 --> 04:59.950
I could run it, see if
anything weird pops up.

05:00.040 --> 05:01.960
Then I'll get us some refills,

05:02.040 --> 05:03.460
and when I get back,
you can tell me

05:03.550 --> 05:05.090
when you're finally gonna
ask my sister out.

05:05.170 --> 05:06.470
It's that obvious?

05:06.550 --> 05:07.850
Only since you were 11.

05:07.930 --> 05:10.220
[scoffs]

05:10.310 --> 05:12.100
[barista]
Two more house blend?

05:12.190 --> 05:14.110
All right.

05:16.070 --> 05:17.410
[beep]

05:25.500 --> 05:26.670
What's the diagnosis?

05:26.760 --> 05:28.180
I don't think it's a virus.

05:28.260 --> 05:29.970
Great, so you're just
that much better than me?

05:30.060 --> 05:32.310
I think you got hacked.

05:32.390 --> 05:33.900
Whatever's doing it
is keylogging you,

05:33.980 --> 05:35.320
seeing everything that you type.

05:41.700 --> 05:43.920
Whoa, whoa.
Hey, Amy, we can fix it.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.920
- Not this. Bye.
- Amy!

05:51.430 --> 05:53.850
Who was it that hacked her?

05:53.940 --> 05:56.980
An online creeper, or...

05:57.070 --> 05:59.990
or someone trying a backdoor
to get into Wizard?

06:01.450 --> 06:03.250
It was your mom.

06:05.920 --> 06:08.800
♪

07:17.060 --> 07:19.020
At first it was just
a little click jacking,

07:19.110 --> 07:20.900
and I was just fooling around,

07:20.990 --> 07:24.080
trying to crack my mom's
password, which I did.

07:24.160 --> 07:28.000
Then I thought, "Why not
move to a bait-and-switch,"

07:28.080 --> 07:30.170
and then I...

07:30.250 --> 07:32.090
You decided to make some money.

07:32.170 --> 07:34.050
But you're already rich.

07:34.140 --> 07:36.520
It wasn't about the money.

07:36.600 --> 07:39.940
It was about beating her,
just once.

07:40.020 --> 07:42.490
But she always wins, Amy.

07:42.570 --> 07:44.780
You know that.
You set off an alarm.

07:44.870 --> 07:47.450
She put me on it,
[sighs] and now...

07:47.540 --> 07:49.040
You're gonna turn me in.

07:49.130 --> 07:50.550
You're gonna turn yourself in.

07:50.630 --> 07:51.960
Are you kidding?

07:52.050 --> 07:54.890
There's no way out.
[chuckles]

07:54.970 --> 07:57.890
There are a lot of people
looking into this breach.

07:59.610 --> 08:01.070
You don't know her.

08:01.150 --> 08:05.490
You don't know
what she'll do to me.

08:05.580 --> 08:09.670
So, she couldn't face her,
admit to what she did.

08:09.750 --> 08:11.920
She'd rather die.

08:15.340 --> 08:18.350
She was upset, freaking out.

08:18.430 --> 08:21.480
I did what I could
to tell her that it
was gonna be okay, but...

08:23.070 --> 08:24.450
I should've done more.

08:24.530 --> 08:26.450
Should've followed her,
stayed with her,

08:26.530 --> 08:29.960
been with her when she
told your mom. I mean...

08:30.040 --> 08:31.540
Tina would've been upset, but...

08:31.630 --> 08:33.380
My mom has known
the entire time.

08:34.549 --> 08:36.049
I think so. Yeah.

08:36.140 --> 08:37.760
She lies to everyone...

08:39.690 --> 08:40.980
about everything.

08:44.030 --> 08:45.240
Just like you.

08:46.410 --> 08:48.240
Nico, I made a promise,

08:48.330 --> 08:50.620
a promise to keep
her secret, and then...

08:50.710 --> 08:52.590
Why drag that all up
after she was dead?

08:52.670 --> 08:54.210
Because I'm still here...

08:55.840 --> 08:57.510
and I deserve the truth.

08:57.600 --> 09:00.140
Come on, Nico, it's not like
you've never made a mistake.

09:00.230 --> 09:01.730
Don't turn this back on me.

09:01.810 --> 09:03.980
I'm not. I'm admitting
that I was wrong, okay,

09:04.070 --> 09:05.240
and I should've done better.

09:05.320 --> 09:06.820
And I want to do better
in the future,

09:06.910 --> 09:09.700
- but Amy was my friend.
- And she was my sister.

09:09.790 --> 09:12.960
Look, I should've told you,
okay, but I couldn't.

09:15.260 --> 09:16.840
And then look what happened.

09:16.930 --> 09:20.520
The clothes, the makeup,
you turned in on yourself,

09:20.600 --> 09:22.310
and the few times
that I tried reaching out...

09:22.390 --> 09:24.230
Alex, you can't keep
the circumstances

09:24.320 --> 09:26.110
of my sister's suicide a secret

09:26.190 --> 09:28.110
and then blame my lipstick.

09:31.410 --> 09:34.710
I was scared, okay?

09:34.800 --> 09:37.340
Scared that you'd
never forgive me.

09:37.420 --> 09:39.260
'Cause losing you
forever, Nico...

09:42.560 --> 09:44.020
that'd be like another death.

09:54.670 --> 09:56.960
It still doesn't make sense.

09:57.050 --> 09:59.390
- What?
- Something's wrong.

09:59.470 --> 10:01.720
Something's always
been wrong. Like...

10:01.810 --> 10:03.890
My mom sealing the house,

10:03.980 --> 10:06.360
not letting me call 911,

10:06.440 --> 10:09.200
Flores, the diary...

10:09.280 --> 10:12.870
If my mom knew
about Amy hacking Wizard,

10:12.950 --> 10:14.920
and it looked like
she killed herself...

10:16.000 --> 10:17.130
why do all that?

10:17.210 --> 10:18.970
Well, if Amy was digging
into Wizard...

10:20.220 --> 10:21.970
Maybe your mom was worried

10:22.060 --> 10:24.140
that she'd found
something out about PRIDE.

10:25.690 --> 10:27.820
Maybe even what we found.

10:27.900 --> 10:30.160
Her laptop was wiped clean,

10:30.240 --> 10:31.780
but we never found her phone.

10:31.870 --> 10:34.830
Not like my parents
wanted to look for it.

10:34.920 --> 10:36.500
There was other stuff
missing, too.

10:37.710 --> 10:39.300
Her backpack.

10:39.380 --> 10:41.970
Maybe she was packing a bag
and planning on running away.

10:42.050 --> 10:45.140
That sounds more like Amy
than suicide.

10:45.230 --> 10:46.860
I need to search her room again.

10:46.940 --> 10:48.900
- All right. I'll come with you.
- I'm good, thanks.

10:58.590 --> 11:01.220
[Janet shushing]

11:01.300 --> 11:04.470
- Son of a bitch.
- [Robert] Geoffrey, hold on!

11:04.560 --> 11:08.360
Geoffrey, we're all upset,
none more so than Chase.

11:11.610 --> 11:14.080
Hey, Chase, how ya doing?

11:15.790 --> 11:19.170
Um... sorry
about your father.

11:19.250 --> 11:20.920
[Janet] I'm the one
that shot him.

11:21.010 --> 11:23.140
Victor was having one
of his episodes.

11:23.220 --> 11:25.180
Mom, what's going on?

11:25.270 --> 11:27.190
Why'd you call them?

11:27.270 --> 11:28.900
Can't exactly call
the police or paramedics

11:28.980 --> 11:30.740
unless you want your mother
taken away in handcuffs.

11:30.820 --> 11:33.240
- She saved me!
- She was also having an affair,

11:33.320 --> 11:36.330
and shot her husband using a gun
registered to her lover.

11:39.670 --> 11:42.930
[Catherine] We have all known
each other a long time.

11:43.010 --> 11:45.930
[Geoffrey] Yeah, we're more
than a charity organization.

11:46.020 --> 11:48.770
We think of each other like...
family.

11:50.320 --> 11:53.030
A pride.

11:53.110 --> 11:55.620
[Catherine] Why don't you
take him upstairs?

11:55.700 --> 11:57.250
He's got some cuts
that need to be cleaned up.

11:57.330 --> 11:58.830
Good idea.

11:58.920 --> 12:00.000
No, I'm not leaving.

12:00.090 --> 12:01.590
Come on, now, son.

12:03.340 --> 12:04.340
We got this.

12:14.320 --> 12:16.790
- What was he still doing here?
- lt's his father.

12:16.870 --> 12:19.580
- Not for long.
- He's lost a lot of blood.

12:19.670 --> 12:22.630
Where the hell
are Dale and Stacey?

12:22.710 --> 12:24.260
Yes, and Graciela's
gonna reach out

12:24.340 --> 12:26.140
to the local school district
in the morning

12:26.220 --> 12:27.770
so you don't get
behind in your studies.

12:27.850 --> 12:29.180
I'm sure it's not as fancy

12:29.270 --> 12:30.940
as your school, but it's nice.

12:31.020 --> 12:33.440
Do you know the man who does
the weather for Channel 5?

12:33.530 --> 12:34.950
- Oh, I love him.
- He went there.

12:35.030 --> 12:37.330
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm. He's doing very well.

12:37.410 --> 12:40.420
He forecasts the weather
in Southern California.
Not that hard.

12:40.500 --> 12:43.050
And I'm sure this isn't
as big as your home, Molly,

12:43.130 --> 12:45.760
but I promise you,
your bed is very comfortable.

12:45.840 --> 12:49.890
I think it's very nice.
Isn't it cozy, Molly, and...

12:49.980 --> 12:53.730
Wow, look at all
the different types of crosses!

12:53.820 --> 12:55.780
Who knew?
Well, you knew, obviously,

12:55.860 --> 12:57.830
because of your...
which is great.

12:57.910 --> 12:59.870
You're making this worse, Dale!

12:59.950 --> 13:03.590
I have a tendency to do that
when I don't know what to say.

13:03.670 --> 13:05.720
How about,
"This is a terrible idea,"

13:05.800 --> 13:07.800
or "Let's not do this,"
or "I'm sorry!"

13:07.890 --> 13:09.010
Molly...

13:09.100 --> 13:10.640
[vibrates]

13:12.060 --> 13:13.400
Oh, no.

13:13.480 --> 13:14.780
Look, Molly, we are sorry

13:14.820 --> 13:15.990
that this is happening,

13:16.070 --> 13:19.620
and also... we have to go.

13:19.700 --> 13:22.040
Honey, now.

13:30.980 --> 13:34.190
Honey, all we ever wanted
is what's best for you.

13:34.270 --> 13:37.740
Tossing me out like I'm
some trash is good for me?

13:37.820 --> 13:41.830
Okay, I know this is hard
to understand right now,

13:41.910 --> 13:44.040
but hopefully in time
you'll see that we had

13:44.130 --> 13:45.590
your best interests at heart.

13:46.670 --> 13:47.930
I hope so.

13:48.010 --> 13:51.100
Till then, bite me, Stacey.

13:51.180 --> 13:54.520
Molly, we love you.

13:54.610 --> 13:56.570
Please know that.

13:59.240 --> 14:00.740
I'm sorry.

14:03.290 --> 14:05.210
[Graciela]
<i>Esta bien. Tranquilo, eh.</i>

14:07.760 --> 14:08.800
<i>Vamos a comer.</i>

14:10.510 --> 14:12.850
It doesn't get
any worse than that.

14:12.930 --> 14:16.020
Oh, yeah, it does.

14:33.560 --> 14:35.190
I'll take one of those.

14:52.100 --> 14:57.940
Thanks.

14:59.740 --> 15:00.860
[groans]

15:03.080 --> 15:05.330
Mom, what if he doesn't make it?

15:06.580 --> 15:08.500
What if he does?

15:11.930 --> 15:13.350
That wasn't him down there.

15:15.020 --> 15:18.440
This time it was...
it was different.

15:18.520 --> 15:19.980
It was like it was
the brain tumor.

15:20.070 --> 15:22.870
Or maybe what that Jonah guy
gave him to fix it.

15:22.950 --> 15:24.120
What if that made it worse?

15:27.000 --> 15:31.970
Look, Chase,
even if a medical condition
was to blame,

15:32.050 --> 15:34.430
- what would really change?
- Everything.

15:36.270 --> 15:38.350
That would mean
he didn't want to kill me.

15:42.570 --> 15:44.490
You still love him.

15:47.790 --> 15:49.540
I'm sure that's what it was.

15:49.630 --> 15:51.840
[doorbell rings]

15:51.920 --> 15:54.260
That must be Dale and Stacey.

15:54.340 --> 15:55.560
What, you invited them?

15:55.640 --> 15:56.720
They're doctors.

16:02.280 --> 16:06.410
You do realize
we're not... doctors.

16:06.490 --> 16:07.500
Well, not surgeons.

16:07.580 --> 16:09.250
You went to medical school.

16:09.330 --> 16:11.090
Yeah, in the '90s.

16:11.170 --> 16:13.510
He's about to die.
You need to do something.

16:16.260 --> 16:17.600
Oh, you need me to do...

16:19.230 --> 16:20.310
Okay.

16:22.650 --> 16:25.030
His pulse is faint, skin's cold.

16:25.110 --> 16:27.490
He's in shock,
but he's hanging in there.

16:27.580 --> 16:30.000
I'd give him an hour or so

16:30.080 --> 16:32.500
before complete
organ failure and death.

16:32.590 --> 16:34.170
It's his axillary artery.

16:35.430 --> 16:38.220
[others groan in disgust]

16:38.310 --> 16:40.850
Direct digital pressure
is the best way
to slow the hemorrhage.

16:42.270 --> 16:44.360
- You guys need to stop it.
- Okay, sure,

16:44.440 --> 16:47.080
but we have no anesthesia,
no blood for transfusion,

16:47.160 --> 16:49.450
never mind the basics,
like gloves or sutures.

16:49.540 --> 16:51.330
This is war, hon.
We can at least tie off

16:51.420 --> 16:52.800
the artery
and stop the bleeding.

16:52.880 --> 16:55.130
He might lose his arm.

16:55.220 --> 16:56.800
Hey, can you find me
dental floss,

16:56.890 --> 16:58.560
needle and thread,
and rubbing alcohol?

16:58.640 --> 16:59.730
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

16:59.810 --> 17:02.310
[Robert] Just what
the world needs...

17:02.400 --> 17:04.900
a new way to beat
the hell out of someone.

17:07.700 --> 17:08.950
Where's Leslie?

17:09.040 --> 17:12.079
She wasn't invited.
Too close to Jonah.

17:12.170 --> 17:13.670
- He already thinks
we're screw-ups.
- Yeah.

17:13.750 --> 17:16.589
This ain't gonna change
his opinion.

17:16.680 --> 17:18.180
That's good.
That's good, sweetie.

17:18.260 --> 17:20.060
I think you got it.
A little to the left.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.849
To the left, I think. Yeah.

17:21.940 --> 17:23.859
- There it is.
- Yeah. Thanks, hon.

17:23.940 --> 17:24.900
Get it, get it, get it.

17:40.600 --> 17:43.520
[phone ringing]

17:44.820 --> 17:46.650
[animals chirping]

17:54.880 --> 17:56.050
[soft whine]

17:57.840 --> 18:01.350
I have no idea what's going on
around here tonight...

18:01.430 --> 18:04.100
but there's no way
I'm sleeping in my room alone.

18:04.190 --> 18:07.360
[purrs]

18:07.440 --> 18:09.820
<i>Hey, it's Gert. How about
instead of leaving a message,</i>

18:09.910 --> 18:11.870
<i>you sign my petition
demanding better wages</i>

18:11.950 --> 18:14.370
<i>for the Chinese factory workers
who made this device?</i>

18:25.020 --> 18:26.940
Chase? Everything okay?

18:28.400 --> 18:31.240
Nope. Definitely not okay.

18:31.320 --> 18:32.790
What's wrong?

18:32.870 --> 18:35.630
<i>It's my dad.
He's... He's hurt.</i>

18:35.710 --> 18:40.180
Well, I mean, we both are,
but he's definitely worse.

18:40.260 --> 18:42.430
How did everything get
so messed up?

18:42.510 --> 18:43.930
What do you mean he's hurt?

18:44.020 --> 18:44.980
Hey, do you think you want

18:45.060 --> 18:46.270
to come over here right now?

18:46.350 --> 18:48.940
I just don't want to be alone...

18:49.030 --> 18:50.400
You know what?
Don't. Sorry.

18:50.490 --> 18:51.620
Just stay out of it.

18:51.700 --> 18:53.620
I shouldn't have
got you involved.

18:53.700 --> 18:54.960
Involved in what?

18:55.040 --> 18:59.130
[sighing]

19:02.890 --> 19:05.270
Hey, sweetie.
I saw your light was still on.

19:05.350 --> 19:07.150
I'm just getting ready for bed.

19:07.230 --> 19:08.940
Anything you need to talk about?

19:13.620 --> 19:18.460
Was it just me, or was Dad
acting kind of weird tonight?

19:18.550 --> 19:22.890
You know your father
can be socially awkward
at public functions.

19:22.970 --> 19:25.390
He always says he's
most comfortable
playing someone else.

19:25.470 --> 19:27.230
Not when he's with me.

19:27.310 --> 19:28.730
When I talked to him tonight

19:28.820 --> 19:30.740
he just seemed,
I don't know, kind of...

19:31.820 --> 19:34.410
different, like, far away.

19:34.490 --> 19:38.500
Honestly, I think he is
a little lost right now.

19:38.590 --> 19:41.090
It's been a difficult time.

19:41.170 --> 19:42.800
You know, Phil fired him.

19:42.890 --> 19:44.970
It's devastating.

19:45.060 --> 19:46.730
And he failed to go Ultra.

19:48.560 --> 19:51.530
I think he's just trying
to figure some things out.

19:52.990 --> 19:54.740
Cut him a little slack.

19:56.240 --> 19:57.250
Good night, Mom.

19:57.330 --> 19:58.540
Night, sweetie.

20:11.190 --> 20:14.950
<i>This is Nico. Do people even
leave messages anymore?</i>

20:16.030 --> 20:17.910
Hey, call me.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.460
I just spoke to Chase.

20:19.540 --> 20:21.670
Something happened to his dad.

20:21.750 --> 20:23.010
Something bad.

20:28.940 --> 20:33.150
Well, the good news is
he's not gonna bleed
to death now.

20:33.240 --> 20:36.320
The bad news is
he's lost a lot of blood.

20:38.660 --> 20:39.790
He's in a coma.

20:41.960 --> 20:45.090
Think of it as the body's way
to heal itself.

20:45.180 --> 20:47.720
So, this is what
you've been keeping from me?

20:49.020 --> 20:50.480
So what are you gonna do?

20:50.560 --> 20:52.110
Call Jonah?

20:52.190 --> 20:53.230
Hell, no.

20:54.280 --> 20:55.320
I'm calling Frank.

21:04.550 --> 21:06.930
You have your mother's taste
for spicy foods.

21:08.350 --> 21:09.600
This was her favorite.

21:09.680 --> 21:12.940
I don't get this much
in my other house.

21:13.020 --> 21:15.700
- Have you ever tried
gefilte fish?
- No.

21:15.780 --> 21:18.200
Don't. It's like putting
a dirty diaper in your mouth.

21:18.280 --> 21:22.580
You know, Molly,
I think you and I are gonna
get along just fine.

21:25.210 --> 21:26.930
I wanted to wait
until the others left

21:27.010 --> 21:30.430
before talking to you
about something important.

21:30.520 --> 21:32.980
I'm not sure about those people,

21:33.060 --> 21:35.070
not really sure
what's going on with you...

21:36.820 --> 21:37.740
but...

21:39.990 --> 21:42.500
your parents sent me this
just before they died.

21:42.580 --> 21:44.500
It's addressed to you.

21:44.590 --> 21:46.630
I kept it because, well,

21:46.720 --> 21:49.760
they were special people
and I wanted to honor them.

21:49.850 --> 21:53.270
They said one day
you might come for it.

21:54.360 --> 21:57.280
And, look, here you are.

22:00.030 --> 22:01.950
<i>Pues andale. Ábralo.</i>

22:09.340 --> 22:10.350
There's a note.

22:18.450 --> 22:20.240
Who's Elian?

22:20.320 --> 22:21.660
My elephant.

22:33.100 --> 22:34.190
You brought them?

22:34.270 --> 22:36.150
Hello to you, too.

22:36.230 --> 22:37.440
What's going on?

22:37.530 --> 22:39.450
You said you wanted in on this,

22:39.530 --> 22:40.820
so here you are.

22:40.910 --> 22:43.660
And yes, it's complicated.

22:43.750 --> 22:45.500
[scoffs] That's pretty much life
with you, Leslie.

22:45.580 --> 22:46.840
Kind of getting used to it now.

22:46.920 --> 22:50.890
This is not the time, Frank.

22:50.970 --> 22:53.180
Look, whatever happens
here tonight,

22:53.270 --> 22:56.270
you cannot tell anyone
about me and Jonah.

22:56.350 --> 22:57.690
I'm not kidding.

22:57.770 --> 22:59.900
The blowback would be
devastating for you,

22:59.990 --> 23:01.450
for me, and for Karolina.

23:01.530 --> 23:03.200
What does Karolina have
to do with any of this?

23:03.290 --> 23:05.960
Leslie, we're
running out of time.

23:06.040 --> 23:08.920
- I'll be right there.
- Hey, Frank.

23:09.010 --> 23:13.760
Please, Frank, I will
tell you everything later,

23:13.850 --> 23:17.440
but for right now,
if you love your daughter,

23:17.520 --> 23:20.030
you will shut the hell up
and do what you're told.

23:20.110 --> 23:21.990
I'll do what I want,
thank you very much.

23:29.960 --> 23:33.050
Uh, just sit anywhere.

23:35.980 --> 23:38.190
Oh, oh, no, not there.
Not there.
You'll crush that.

23:38.270 --> 23:39.940
Just, uh, there.
Yeah.

23:42.570 --> 23:43.990
Stop.

23:45.790 --> 23:48.380
[phone rings]

23:51.090 --> 23:53.300
- Hey.
- Hey. Chase is really upset.

23:53.390 --> 23:54.600
Have you talked to him tonight?

23:54.680 --> 23:56.220
Why, no, I haven't.

23:56.310 --> 23:58.270
There's been a couple
other things going on here.

23:58.350 --> 24:00.730
I tried calling Molly, too,
but she's not picking up.

24:00.820 --> 24:02.280
You called Molly before me?

24:02.360 --> 24:03.950
We've been bonding lately.

24:04.030 --> 24:06.410
- Well, that's over.
- What do you mean?

24:06.490 --> 24:11.090
My parents sent Molly away
to stay with a relative.

24:11.170 --> 24:12.420
I was about to text you guys.

24:12.510 --> 24:13.840
Away? Why?

24:13.930 --> 24:15.350
<i>She's okay, I think.</i>

24:15.430 --> 24:16.850
For now, at least.

24:16.930 --> 24:18.350
I don't know
what's gonna happen later.

24:18.440 --> 24:19.520
My parents aren't back yet.

24:19.600 --> 24:22.150
Okay, I'm coming to get you.

24:22.230 --> 24:23.530
We can go to Chase's together.

24:23.610 --> 24:25.740
If Chase needed you,
why would you even call me?

24:25.830 --> 24:27.790
Why didn't you just go
straight to his place?

24:30.790 --> 24:32.710
Because you don't want
to be alone with him.

24:32.800 --> 24:36.260
Because he kissed you...

24:36.350 --> 24:39.270
<i>and you don't like him.
You like Nico,</i>

24:39.350 --> 24:41.900
who likes Alex.

24:41.980 --> 24:44.700
We should go right away!
I'll drive.

24:44.780 --> 24:46.320
Fine, but hurry.

24:49.830 --> 24:51.170
He called me first.

24:53.670 --> 24:54.590
What?

24:57.640 --> 24:59.770
So, is he back in now?

25:01.400 --> 25:03.360
<i>Back</i> in?

25:03.440 --> 25:05.360
Just focus on what you're doing.

25:05.450 --> 25:06.450
Which is what?

25:06.530 --> 25:07.910
How are gloves gonna help?

25:12.250 --> 25:17.340
Okay, so the light signature
resembles that of a box, right,

25:17.430 --> 25:19.680
and if that converts matter
into energy,

25:19.770 --> 25:21.140
then those gloves might also be

25:21.230 --> 25:22.770
some kind
of regenerative technology.

25:22.860 --> 25:24.900
Please, Dale, if the gunshot
didn't kill him,

25:24.990 --> 25:26.910
you may bore him to death.

25:26.990 --> 25:28.950
- Yeah, let's just get this done.
- [gasps sharply]

25:29.030 --> 25:31.290
- That's good, right?
- Victor, can you hear me?

25:31.370 --> 25:32.920
He can.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.090
Ow! It's... This isn't...

25:35.170 --> 25:36.220
Just give it a chance.

25:36.300 --> 25:38.220
Ow! No! He's
hurting my hand!

25:38.300 --> 25:40.220
- Breaking it!
- What's happening?

25:40.310 --> 25:41.560
It's not working.

25:46.360 --> 25:47.320
His heart is racing.

25:47.400 --> 25:48.950
Hold on a second. Hold on.

25:56.840 --> 25:58.130
Not anymore.

25:58.220 --> 25:59.300
It stopped.

26:01.520 --> 26:02.730
He's dead.

26:25.360 --> 26:27.570
- You ready to do this?
- Sure.

26:28.990 --> 26:30.620
What exactly are we doing?

26:32.790 --> 26:34.540
Shit, get down!

26:43.430 --> 26:45.060
That's the guy
I met at the gala.

26:45.150 --> 26:46.980
Friends with my mom,
part of the church.

26:47.070 --> 26:48.650
Stares very intensely.

26:48.740 --> 26:50.570
Isn't that just how
all guys look at you?

26:50.660 --> 26:53.540
What do you think
he's doing at Chase's?

26:55.750 --> 26:58.460
Right, right, right...
Get the door...

26:58.550 --> 26:59.760
Aah! Shitballs.

26:59.840 --> 27:01.470
It's Jonah.

27:03.810 --> 27:05.640
Well, that was inevitable.

27:05.730 --> 27:08.020
[Geoffrey]
Who called him?

27:08.110 --> 27:09.110
Who do you think?

27:09.190 --> 27:10.400
It wasn't me.

27:27.770 --> 27:29.900
So grateful to have
gotten the heads up.

27:29.980 --> 27:32.200
Would not have wanted
to miss this.

27:33.660 --> 27:35.960
Thank you, Tina,
you always do the right thing.

27:38.960 --> 27:40.800
What other choice did we have,

27:40.880 --> 27:44.560
once Frank killed Victor
with his magic mittens?

27:47.650 --> 27:49.690
I'll get this primed.

27:49.770 --> 27:52.240
Geoffrey, Robert,
and Dale, I need you

27:52.320 --> 27:55.540
to pull the other device
from its hiding place

27:55.620 --> 27:57.290
and put Victor inside.

27:57.370 --> 27:58.960
You're gonna sacrifice Victor?

27:59.040 --> 28:01.340
That would be of little use.
No, no, no, no.

28:01.420 --> 28:03.640
I intend to do the opposite.

28:06.270 --> 28:10.440
I'm gonna revive him
the way I get revived.

28:10.520 --> 28:13.610
Time is of the essence,
but I can bring him back.

28:13.700 --> 28:17.500
But that means you need
another body to convert.

28:17.580 --> 28:19.290
Correct.

28:24.380 --> 28:27.310
[pulsing sound]

28:40.250 --> 28:42.340
And who did you have in mind?

28:42.420 --> 28:46.260
The one responsible
for this mess.

28:46.350 --> 28:49.730
Jonah...
it's not my fault.

28:49.810 --> 28:51.820
I know it's not, my dear.

28:56.240 --> 28:57.660
It's hers.

29:11.770 --> 29:13.780
So you know how to break
into Chase's house

29:13.860 --> 29:16.660
because you've been stalking
him since preschool?

29:16.740 --> 29:19.750
No, because we were astronomy
partners in eighth grade.

29:19.830 --> 29:22.080
His dad has
a telescope on the roof,

29:22.170 --> 29:24.880
so we used to sneak in
through here.

29:24.960 --> 29:27.260
I did most of the stargazing.

29:27.340 --> 29:30.100
He spent the entire time
playing Candy Crush

29:30.180 --> 29:31.520
and sexting Eiffel.

29:36.530 --> 29:37.780
[clanging]

29:37.870 --> 29:39.700
Shh! Girl, quiet!

29:39.790 --> 29:41.830
- Sorry, that was me.
- [clanging, roaring]

29:41.920 --> 29:45.250
Unless that is
who you're referring to.

29:50.850 --> 29:52.020
[whines]

29:58.110 --> 29:59.580
[snuffles]

29:59.660 --> 30:00.990
Follow me.

30:05.550 --> 30:07.510
The weirdest thing
isn't that my parents

30:07.590 --> 30:08.930
left me a mysterious key

30:09.010 --> 30:10.470
with an even
more mysterious note

30:10.560 --> 30:12.060
telling me to find
my stuffed elephant.

30:12.140 --> 30:14.980
It's that my elephant
isn't lost.

30:17.240 --> 30:18.490
What does it mean?

30:18.570 --> 30:21.160
We can figure it out
in the morning.

30:21.240 --> 30:23.040
Right now you need to sleep.

30:25.080 --> 30:27.090
I did lose him one time.

30:28.510 --> 30:29.640
I left him on a train.

30:30.800 --> 30:32.810
I was so upset.

30:32.890 --> 30:35.060
But then my dad told us all
to jump back in the car

30:35.150 --> 30:36.690
and we drove
to the next station.

30:36.770 --> 30:37.940
We beat the train there,

30:38.030 --> 30:39.860
and Elian was exactly
where I left him.

30:41.700 --> 30:43.120
Is there a train station
around here?

30:43.200 --> 30:44.830
There's a Metrolink.

30:44.920 --> 30:46.630
We can go down there
in the morning if you'd like.
[speaks Spanish]

30:47.800 --> 30:48.970
Sounds good.

31:39.110 --> 31:41.190
[Frank] Chase, you shouldn't be
down here right now.

31:41.280 --> 31:43.280
- Chase, Chase...
- Get outta my way, man.

31:43.370 --> 31:44.580
Get out of my way,
Mr. Dean.

31:44.660 --> 31:46.330
No offense, but if you
do not step aside,

31:46.410 --> 31:47.370
I will drop you.

31:47.460 --> 31:48.420
I appreciate how much you care

31:48.500 --> 31:49.710
about your father right now.

31:49.800 --> 31:50.880
I really do,
but I think it'd be best

31:50.960 --> 31:52.090
if you just went back upstairs.

31:52.180 --> 31:53.800
- No, just...
- Whoa, and I know

31:53.890 --> 31:55.510
you might've missed
a string of action movies

31:55.600 --> 31:57.640
that I made in the early aughts
for the Chinese market,

31:57.730 --> 31:59.820
but my martial arts training,
it's very real.

31:59.900 --> 32:03.360
- I don't want to have
to hurt you.
- Just let me see my dad!

32:03.450 --> 32:05.990
Let me see my dad!

32:07.080 --> 32:08.830
Please.

32:08.920 --> 32:10.380
He's gonna be okay.

32:10.460 --> 32:12.380
Just have some faith, son.

32:13.890 --> 32:15.390
Jonah's here.

32:15.470 --> 32:17.270
Wait, who is that guy?

32:17.350 --> 32:20.310
- I've got this.
- Karolina?

32:20.400 --> 32:22.900
Chase, you're hurt.
Why don't you go back
up to your room, okay?

32:22.990 --> 32:25.070
Gert's waiting for you.
I'll be up in a second.

32:26.410 --> 32:27.750
- Okay.
- Okay. Come on.

32:36.640 --> 32:38.270
Karolina, what are you
doing here?

32:38.350 --> 32:39.850
I was gonna ask you
the same thing.

32:39.940 --> 32:42.480
There was an accident.
Victor got hurt.

32:42.570 --> 32:44.360
The Steins asked some
of their closest friends

32:44.450 --> 32:45.950
to come over and help.

32:46.030 --> 32:48.580
Dad, Victor Stein
doesn't have any friends.

32:48.660 --> 32:50.000
That's PRIDE that's down there,

32:50.080 --> 32:51.590
which you told me
you weren't a part of!

32:51.670 --> 32:53.170
Dad, you were the only one

32:53.260 --> 32:54.760
that is good, Dad, please!

32:54.840 --> 32:56.970
Honey, what are you
talking about?

32:57.050 --> 32:58.390
Do you know what they do?

32:58.470 --> 33:01.690
PRIDE? They raise money
for charity, honey,

33:01.770 --> 33:03.320
that school they're building.

33:03.400 --> 33:05.070
No. No, Dad, that is not it.

33:05.150 --> 33:06.660
That is not it at all.

33:06.740 --> 33:08.160
Then tell me what it is.

33:09.370 --> 33:10.370
Tell me about it.

33:19.220 --> 33:21.390
This night has been so weird.

33:38.050 --> 33:40.730
[roars]

33:40.810 --> 33:43.190
Holy shit!
Gert, look out!

33:43.270 --> 33:46.150
Chase, chill.
Also, lacrosse sticks

33:46.240 --> 33:48.410
are not the cure-all
for everything.

33:48.490 --> 33:50.200
That thing already
tried to kill us!

33:50.290 --> 33:52.750
She listens to me
and protects me,

33:52.830 --> 33:55.630
which means if I say so,
she protects us.

33:58.180 --> 34:00.600
- Hey...
- [snuffles]

34:01.770 --> 34:03.600
Hey...

34:03.690 --> 34:04.820
- [roars]
- [gasps]

34:04.900 --> 34:06.030
[Gert] Okay, you know,

34:06.110 --> 34:08.659
maybe I should just
do the touching.

34:10.199 --> 34:12.290
Got it.

34:12.370 --> 34:15.250
Wait, why does he get to decide?

34:15.340 --> 34:17.300
Maybe somebody else
should be sacrificed.

34:17.380 --> 34:18.630
How 'bout a show of hands?

34:18.719 --> 34:21.179
This isn't <i>Survivor,</i> Janet.

34:21.260 --> 34:23.270
You can't convince us to vote
someone else off the island.

34:23.350 --> 34:25.570
But any one of you would've done
the exact same thing

34:25.650 --> 34:27.820
if you were in my shoes.
Tell me I'm wrong!

34:27.900 --> 34:30.030
I'm willing to say I'm Spartacus
if everyone else is.

34:30.120 --> 34:33.120
The decision has been made.
We all heard Jonah.

34:33.210 --> 34:35.710
Actually, this is
all your fault!

34:35.790 --> 34:38.670
Whatever Jonah Juice
he injected into Victor

34:38.760 --> 34:40.929
did something to him,
something terrible,

34:41.010 --> 34:43.230
so if anyone is
to blame here, it's you!

34:43.310 --> 34:46.230
We both know that's
not gonna happen.
Nice try, though.

34:46.310 --> 34:49.949
No offense, Janet, but the team
can survive without you.

34:50.030 --> 34:52.120
It's not like you ever really
brought anything to the table.

34:52.199 --> 34:54.540
- Is that really necessary?
- No, no, it's okay.

34:54.620 --> 34:56.630
I'm glad she finally
said it to my face.

34:56.710 --> 34:58.920
You've always judged me
for being a stay-at-home mom,

34:59.010 --> 35:02.100
but the truth is,
I could've done something else.

35:02.180 --> 35:04.560
I could've invented something
and changed the world,

35:04.640 --> 35:07.190
but instead my life
became about managing

35:07.270 --> 35:09.280
the brilliant Victor Stein.

35:09.360 --> 35:12.200
So you guys, you all
took Jonah's gifts

35:12.280 --> 35:14.250
and you got success and fame,

35:14.330 --> 35:16.630
and I got an abusive
megalomaniac!

35:16.710 --> 35:18.550
[Geoffrey] We know
Victor wasn't easy,

35:18.630 --> 35:21.180
but if you'd come to us before,
we could've helped.

35:21.260 --> 35:24.520
Really? Would any of you
have actually stood up to him?

35:24.600 --> 35:25.890
I guess now we'll never know.

35:25.980 --> 35:27.400
You know what?
Shut up, Catherine.

35:27.480 --> 35:29.690
It's time to embrace
the light, Janet.

35:31.450 --> 35:32.820
What about Dale?

35:32.910 --> 35:35.120
Look at Dale.
What's so great about Dale?

35:35.200 --> 35:36.790
What's Dale ever done for PRIDE?

35:36.870 --> 35:39.500
Research that's proven crucial
to our mission,

35:39.590 --> 35:42.430
not to mention patenting
a mind-wipe drug

35:42.510 --> 35:44.600
that everyone here's found
pretty valuable.

35:44.680 --> 35:46.180
Um, we developed
that patent together,

35:46.270 --> 35:47.440
in case anybody was
gonna vote against me.

35:47.520 --> 35:48.440
We did. Of course.

35:48.520 --> 35:49.690
But when push came to shove,

35:49.780 --> 35:51.150
neither one of you
could save Victor.

35:51.240 --> 35:52.450
We only needed to save Victor

35:52.530 --> 35:53.660
because you shot him, Janet.

35:53.740 --> 35:55.120
Why don't we go get Frank?

35:55.200 --> 35:57.580
Put him in the box.
He's not even in PRIDE.

35:57.670 --> 35:58.960
Not the worst idea.

35:59.040 --> 36:00.630
Look, I don't care who you pick.

36:00.710 --> 36:02.170
Victor is the only one of you

36:02.260 --> 36:04.430
that's actually necessary
for this to work.

36:04.510 --> 36:07.770
The dig is about to start,
and his time is just about up,

36:07.850 --> 36:11.190
so I would appreciate it
if you choose quickly.

36:11.280 --> 36:13.820
Because if I don't
revive him, you all die.

36:15.120 --> 36:16.950
And so do your children.

36:17.040 --> 36:19.630
- Okay, that is not necessary.
- That is not fair!

36:19.710 --> 36:22.590
- Janet, get in the box!
- Jonah is the one to blame!

36:22.670 --> 36:26.220
[overlapping shouting]

36:26.310 --> 36:28.560
All right, enough! Stop!

36:28.640 --> 36:31.020
When my girls are involved,
that is where I draw the line.

36:31.110 --> 36:33.030
Now somebody is getting
in the goddamn box,

36:33.110 --> 36:35.070
and personally, I don't mind
if it's Tina.

36:35.160 --> 36:37.080
I'm just putting it out there.
That's my vote.

36:37.160 --> 36:38.460
Dale, what are you
doing with a gun?

36:38.540 --> 36:39.580
It was on the table.

36:39.670 --> 36:41.040
Do you even know how to fire it?

36:41.130 --> 36:43.510
Nope! That means
I am unpredictable

36:43.590 --> 36:45.970
and therefore
much more dangerous!

36:47.930 --> 36:49.940
Okay, now, let's go now!

36:50.020 --> 36:51.860
[cocking]

36:51.940 --> 36:53.610
Put the gun down, Dale.

36:53.690 --> 36:55.780
Crap. He got the drop on me.

36:55.870 --> 36:57.580
I said drop it, Yorkes!

36:57.660 --> 37:00.210
I wasn't gonna
hurt anybody, man.
You know that.

37:00.290 --> 37:03.000
Right, okay, I'm just thinking
about my kids.

37:03.090 --> 37:04.680
I'm not playing with you.

37:04.760 --> 37:08.390
All right, man. It's me, Dale.
I'm dropping it.

37:08.470 --> 37:10.350
- [gunshot]
- [screaming]

37:10.440 --> 37:11.650
What the hell, man!

37:11.730 --> 37:12.980
Who does that?

37:13.070 --> 37:14.820
See? Box him.

37:14.900 --> 37:17.120
Come on, we're all
on the same side here, right?

37:17.200 --> 37:19.580
Time is running out.

37:19.660 --> 37:21.170
I'll make this easy for you.

37:22.250 --> 37:23.710
It's a family problem.

37:24.800 --> 37:26.720
Either you get in the box,

37:26.800 --> 37:29.100
or your son gets in the box.

37:34.990 --> 37:36.360
I'll go.

37:36.450 --> 37:38.780
- Janet, wait, no.
- I'll go. I'm gonna go.

37:38.870 --> 37:40.200
Robert, what are you doing?

37:40.290 --> 37:41.670
I just have something private

37:41.750 --> 37:43.880
I'd like to say
before it's too late.

37:43.960 --> 37:46.220
Can we have a moment alone?

37:46.300 --> 37:47.220
Please?

37:51.770 --> 37:53.350
You got two minutes.

38:33.600 --> 38:35.570
[sighs]

38:41.200 --> 38:43.000
[relieved sigh]

38:58.530 --> 38:59.910
You don't need to do this.

38:59.990 --> 39:01.660
Yes, I actually do.

39:01.740 --> 39:03.410
This is what's best
for everyone.

39:03.490 --> 39:04.660
Not for me.

39:04.750 --> 39:06.790
Oh, that's sweet.
You're sweet,

39:06.880 --> 39:08.920
but this is... this is my time.

39:10.550 --> 39:13.430
Then you should at least
get to say goodbye.

39:13.510 --> 39:15.230
He's gonna miss you terribly.

39:15.310 --> 39:17.060
How am I even supposed
to face him,

39:17.150 --> 39:18.270
let alone say goodbye?

39:18.360 --> 39:19.860
Think about what it'll do to him

39:19.950 --> 39:21.620
if he never gets
to have that moment.

39:33.510 --> 39:35.640
I have to say goodbye to my son.

39:35.730 --> 39:38.570
- Absolutely not.
- I'm not gonna tell
him anything.

39:38.650 --> 39:41.950
I just want to hug him
for a final time.

39:43.410 --> 39:44.830
He's my baby. Please.

39:44.910 --> 39:46.410
[Catherine]
She deserves that chance.

39:48.080 --> 39:49.340
That's what we would want.

39:49.420 --> 39:51.260
We wouldn't be in this position.

39:51.340 --> 39:52.800
You sure?

39:52.890 --> 39:55.850
Um, I don't think
you have to worry about that.

39:55.930 --> 39:57.850
- Oh, boy.
- And why is that?

39:57.940 --> 39:59.820
Robert's getting in the box.

39:59.900 --> 40:01.900
[gasps]

40:06.620 --> 40:08.960
If anyone dies tonight, it's me.

40:13.760 --> 40:15.810
Robert, please, don't do this.

40:15.890 --> 40:17.100
You're being irrational.

40:17.180 --> 40:18.690
What do you even care, Tina?

40:18.770 --> 40:21.940
I've done nothing
but humiliate you, betray you.

40:22.030 --> 40:24.370
I let you down.
I let our girls down.

40:26.120 --> 40:28.960
I couldn't protect Amy.

40:29.040 --> 40:33.930
Janet saves her child,
and for that she needs to die?

40:35.350 --> 40:36.260
This...

40:39.770 --> 40:41.820
This is
the honorable thing to do.

40:46.330 --> 40:47.790
This works, too.

40:47.870 --> 40:50.290
At this point in time,
he's expendable.

40:50.380 --> 40:52.170
But he's still my husband.

40:56.350 --> 40:58.220
Don't do that!

41:11.420 --> 41:12.840
<i>This is Nico.</i>

41:12.920 --> 41:15.130
<i>Do people even leave
messages anymore?</i>

41:15.220 --> 41:18.260
Please, Nico, I can't
apologize enough.

41:18.350 --> 41:19.680
Call me back so we can talk.

41:19.770 --> 41:21.560
I'm still at Timely,
just waiting.

41:21.650 --> 41:24.360
- [beep]
- [Tina] <i>What I want to know is</i>

41:24.440 --> 41:26.200
<i>what Victor's gonna do
with that box.</i>

41:26.280 --> 41:28.080
Holy shit, it's decrypted.

41:28.160 --> 41:30.210
You guys better get over here.

41:30.290 --> 41:32.750
[Leslie] <i>Brooks here is
going to get into it.</i>

41:32.840 --> 41:35.510
<i>Just follow the light, Brooks.</i>

41:35.590 --> 41:38.180
<i>When it comes for you, go with it.</i>

41:38.260 --> 41:40.430
[Brooks] <i>Whatever you say, Mrs. Dean.</i>

41:47.110 --> 41:49.370
What have you done?

41:49.450 --> 41:51.370
And for Robert?

41:52.500 --> 41:53.710
You wouldn't understand.

41:53.790 --> 41:56.470
No, you don't understand.

41:56.550 --> 41:58.260
You don't understand
what it means

41:58.340 --> 41:59.600
to destroy one of the boxes

41:59.680 --> 42:00.980
when the only person who knows

42:01.060 --> 42:02.810
how to make one is legally dead.

42:02.900 --> 42:04.650
What, are you gonna blast me
with that thing?

42:04.730 --> 42:06.030
Go right ahead.

42:06.110 --> 42:08.490
I'm thinking more
of smacking you with it.

42:08.570 --> 42:10.330
Enough, enough,
enough, enough, enough.

42:10.410 --> 42:12.080
Come on, come on.
No one enjoys

42:12.160 --> 42:13.630
a good cat fight more than me,

42:13.710 --> 42:15.590
and the thought
of you two going at it

42:15.670 --> 42:16.970
would be one for the ages,

42:17.050 --> 42:18.340
but I think
we've had enough drama

42:18.430 --> 42:20.600
for one night, don't you think?

42:23.690 --> 42:28.610
I'm fine. I told you it was
gonna be the last sacrifice,

42:28.700 --> 42:30.660
and I meant it.

42:33.460 --> 42:34.370
Sorry.

42:35.630 --> 42:36.960
Apology accepted.

42:38.840 --> 42:39.760
I'm fine.

42:42.520 --> 42:44.140
[speaking Japanese]

42:57.210 --> 43:00.970
[continues in Japanese]

43:20.720 --> 43:23.260
What about Victor?

43:32.870 --> 43:34.490
Well, you seem pumped.

43:34.580 --> 43:36.080
Either you've forgiven me,

43:36.170 --> 43:38.250
or you have a secret fetish
for snuff films.

43:38.340 --> 43:39.800
I found the backpack.

43:39.880 --> 43:41.930
- Holy shit.
- And her phone.

43:42.010 --> 43:43.970
It was dead, but it's charging.

43:44.060 --> 43:46.900
And I prayed to the maiden,
the mother, and the crone

43:46.980 --> 43:48.770
that there's something on it
that leads to the truth.

43:48.860 --> 43:50.190
That's amazing, Nico.

43:50.280 --> 43:52.910
I don't know much
about maidens and crones,

43:52.990 --> 43:54.620
but I do know
what it means to you

43:54.700 --> 43:55.950
to finally have your answers.

43:56.040 --> 43:58.170
No thanks to you.

43:58.250 --> 44:00.800
And she's back,
mad Nico. Got it.

44:02.930 --> 44:04.470
You watched the whole thing?

44:05.640 --> 44:06.680
Scrolled through it.

44:08.310 --> 44:09.310
How bad is it?

44:09.400 --> 44:10.860
It's the worst thing

44:10.940 --> 44:13.320
I've ever seen,

44:13.410 --> 44:16.120
possibly that anyone
has ever seen.

44:32.150 --> 44:34.360
What just happened?

44:34.450 --> 44:38.250
Well, I can't fully revive him
without a sacrifice.

44:38.330 --> 44:41.550
However, a jolt
from the inner coil
should be enough

44:41.630 --> 44:43.930
to keep his mitochondria
nourished for a time.

44:44.010 --> 44:45.890
- Should be?
- Yeah.

44:47.930 --> 44:49.480
Is he gonna be okay?

44:49.560 --> 44:51.520
That's what we're
all hoping for.

44:53.360 --> 44:54.780
Fellas, a hand, please.

45:00.630 --> 45:02.710
The last time we did
something like this

45:02.800 --> 45:04.970
was at Gene and Alice's funeral.

45:06.350 --> 45:08.730
We've never done
something like this.

45:13.280 --> 45:14.610
Honey, you still awake?

45:17.950 --> 45:20.080
How's Dad? Is he alive?

45:21.710 --> 45:23.710
PRIDE's taking care of him.

45:25.010 --> 45:27.470
He's being given great care...

45:27.550 --> 45:30.690
exceptional care,
so I don't want you to worry.

45:31.770 --> 45:32.900
When Dad gets better...

45:34.530 --> 45:37.830
I really want another chance
with him, you know?

45:37.910 --> 45:39.910
What do you think?

45:40.000 --> 45:42.210
I think he would love that.

45:52.480 --> 45:53.980
Way to front to your mom.

45:54.070 --> 45:56.190
Alex texted us.
We have to go.

46:01.000 --> 46:04.920
[traffic passing]

46:05.000 --> 46:07.340
[distant chatter]

46:30.970 --> 46:32.270
Twenty, twenty, twenty...

46:34.730 --> 46:35.690
Come on.

46:42.330 --> 46:43.830
What is this?

46:48.760 --> 46:49.890
I don't want to watch it.

46:51.970 --> 46:54.350
Yeah, you don't have to.

46:54.440 --> 46:58.190
They all start off different,
but they all end the same.

46:58.280 --> 47:01.160
Still, there's something
I don't understand.

47:01.240 --> 47:02.410
Our parents.

47:02.490 --> 47:03.960
Tell me about it.

47:04.040 --> 47:06.130
No, I mean, they don't like it.

47:06.210 --> 47:07.380
It bothers them.

47:07.460 --> 47:09.090
Then why do they do it?

47:09.170 --> 47:11.090
I don't know.

47:13.680 --> 47:15.480
I mean, that's the question
we've been asking ourselves

47:15.560 --> 47:17.270
from the beginning,
and we still have no clue.

47:17.360 --> 47:18.780
[vehicle approaches]

47:28.300 --> 47:29.420
Hey, girl, stay here.

47:32.970 --> 47:34.390
Got it all right here,

47:34.470 --> 47:36.980
all the proof we need
to put 'em away forever.

47:37.060 --> 47:38.650
Where are we sending it first?

47:38.730 --> 47:41.360
We don't.

47:41.450 --> 47:44.790
There's so much
that we don't understand.
Too much.

47:44.870 --> 47:48.170
And now, if something
happens to PRIDE,
my dad dies.

47:48.250 --> 47:49.920
This video can't get out.

47:50.010 --> 47:52.130
I agree.

47:52.220 --> 47:54.600
You do? Since when?

47:54.680 --> 47:57.650
Since I spoke to my dad,
and I think he could help us.

47:57.730 --> 47:59.980
Well, if Frank Dean
is our only hope,

48:00.070 --> 48:02.110
we are way more screwed
than I realized.

48:02.200 --> 48:03.660
You two want to back out now?

48:03.740 --> 48:06.870
No. No way. All right,
we've come too far.

48:06.960 --> 48:09.290
If you guys don't want to go
through with it, fine,
the rest of us will.

48:09.380 --> 48:11.420
- Give me the laptop!
- Not your choice, Chase.

48:11.510 --> 48:14.560
- Wilder, I can't let
you do this.
- It's not up to you!

48:14.640 --> 48:18.600
- [Gert] Hey. Hey! Hey!
- [Nico] What's wrong with you?

48:18.690 --> 48:20.690
Nico? Stop, guys!

48:20.780 --> 48:22.820
- Hey!
- Oh, shit!

48:22.900 --> 48:24.530
[Nico] Are you kidding me?

48:24.620 --> 48:26.490
[Gert] Alex... guys!

48:26.580 --> 48:29.420
- Guys, no!
- Guys, stop!

Chase! No, no, no! Chase!

48:31.300 --> 48:33.970

Don't! Chase, no!

The hell are you doing?!

48:39.190 --> 48:41.230
Hey, Chase, goddamn it!

48:41.320 --> 48:42.820
[Nico] Are you kidding me!

48:42.900 --> 48:44.700
What's wrong with you?

I'm sorry.
