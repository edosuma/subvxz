00:07.290 --> 00:08.951
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

00:09.159 --> 00:10.592
Be good, son.

00:11.661 --> 00:13.754
We usually do amnio
when you're over 35.

00:13.964 --> 00:16.626
Unless you have genetic disorders
in your family.

00:17.167 --> 00:20.034
No, Reggie. I'm seeing someone else.

00:20.670 --> 00:23.104
Can I hang around
and see how this goes?

00:23.440 --> 00:24.429
Absolutely.

00:24.641 --> 00:27.303
Thank you, but I'm taking
the trauma fellowship.

00:27.510 --> 00:28.602
Fine. Whatever.

00:28.812 --> 00:31.508
- I'd consider you for cardiothoracic.
- Isn't that Peter's?

00:31.715 --> 00:34.275
Ritalin's for hyperactive children.
You're 24.

00:34.484 --> 00:37.146
My doctor prescribes it.
I'm not doing anything wrong.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:08.852 --> 01:12.117
- Did I do something wrong?
- Just trying to get your attention.

01:12.322 --> 01:14.552
Which hasn't been easy to do of late.

01:14.758 --> 01:18.091
- I've been busy working.
- And seeing someone else.

01:18.294 --> 01:20.421
- I gotta get to work.
- Want a lift?

01:20.630 --> 01:21.858
It's two blocks away.

01:22.065 --> 01:25.762
- You want to be resisting an officer?
- Are you gonna arrest me?

01:25.969 --> 01:28.369
Well, I'm a cop. That's what I do.

01:31.241 --> 01:32.367
Okay, you win.

01:33.309 --> 01:34.571
Whoa.

01:35.712 --> 01:38.237
Let's pick up the doggy.

01:38.715 --> 01:40.307
Can you say "doggy," Reece?

01:40.683 --> 01:42.014
Doggy.

01:42.452 --> 01:43.817
Doggy.

01:45.588 --> 01:48.887
- I don't think he's got that one yet.
- He will soon.

01:49.092 --> 01:52.289
He's doing great.
He's responding to vocalizations...

01:52.495 --> 01:55.521
...repeating back more.
I just wish we had more time.

01:55.732 --> 01:58.792
In a month, I'll be able
to add more sessions a week.

01:59.002 --> 02:00.492
Cutting back your schedule?

02:00.703 --> 02:04.002
This trauma fellowship I'll have
will give me more free time.

02:04.541 --> 02:07.533
That's great. On top of
the three sessions we have now...

02:07.744 --> 02:09.644
...Reece is gonna make real progress.

02:09.846 --> 02:12.144
Three? Is Carla coming
twice a week now?

02:12.816 --> 02:14.283
No. Just once.

02:14.484 --> 02:18.147
But her fianc Á's doing a session
once a week now too.

02:18.788 --> 02:22.189
- Roger's working with Reece here?
- I assumed you knew.

02:23.293 --> 02:27.423
No, no, no. I mean, it's not
a problem, you know?

02:28.298 --> 02:30.425
The more we work with him, the better.

02:30.633 --> 02:31.622
Right.

02:32.135 --> 02:33.693
See you next time.

03:01.197 --> 03:03.563
- Excuse me. Is that your son?
- What?

03:04.067 --> 03:05.728
No, he's not mine.

03:05.935 --> 03:07.425
Where'd he come from?

03:15.712 --> 03:18.180
- Are you with this child?
- No.

03:18.381 --> 03:22.078
Hi there. Where's your mommy, huh?

03:22.285 --> 03:24.378
Where's your mommy?

03:24.587 --> 03:26.282
Where's your mommy?

03:26.489 --> 03:27.478
Is he okay?

03:29.159 --> 03:30.319
No.

03:32.896 --> 03:34.830
Something's not right with him.

03:36.833 --> 03:37.822
Do you feel okay?

03:39.202 --> 03:40.499
What's your name, honey?

03:40.703 --> 03:42.432
Can you tell me your name?

03:45.175 --> 03:47.769
Okay. All right. All right.

03:48.511 --> 03:52.572
We're gonna take good care of you.
Don't worry, you're gonna be okay.

04:43.399 --> 04:45.867
Jerry, why can't I get
an outside line?

04:46.069 --> 04:48.936
- You have to punch in the code first.
- The code?

04:49.138 --> 04:51.971
- A Rocket Romano innovation.
- What for?

04:52.175 --> 04:54.143
To make things more difficult.

04:54.344 --> 04:55.811
Have you seen Dr. Greene?

04:56.012 --> 04:57.843
Rounds with His High Holiness.

04:58.047 --> 05:00.277
- Hear about the new code?
- Unbelievable.

05:00.483 --> 05:02.747
- Tell Mark I need to speak with him.
- Sure.

05:02.952 --> 05:05.113
Carla, it's me. We need to talk.

05:05.321 --> 05:07.482
No, no, no. Reece is fine.

05:07.690 --> 05:10.682
But we need to talk
about some other stuff, okay?

05:11.261 --> 05:13.092
Yeah. I know. I just...

05:13.596 --> 05:15.427
Well, can you get away for lunch?

05:16.199 --> 05:18.326
Great, I'll meet you there. Bye.

05:18.534 --> 05:19.831
You just found him?

05:20.036 --> 05:22.095
Wandering around, a block from here.

05:22.305 --> 05:26.639
Resps 11, pupils still,
pinpoint and nonreactive.

05:26.843 --> 05:28.868
Lacerations on the feet look infected.

05:29.078 --> 05:34.015
Let's get an O-2 mask on him, CBC,
lytes, tox screen, EIKG and bag a urine.

05:34.217 --> 05:36.742
- So you think he was just lost?
- And neglected.

05:36.953 --> 05:40.411
With the decreased resps
and contracted pupils...

05:40.623 --> 05:42.853
...I'd say he
might have been given opiates.

05:43.059 --> 05:45.357
We need to give him Narcan,
.10 milligram.

05:45.561 --> 05:47.927
Stand by with an intubation tray.

05:48.264 --> 05:50.926
He's dehydrated. I can't get a line.

05:51.334 --> 05:53.427
Blew the hand
and the antecubital.

05:53.636 --> 05:55.900
Can't use the infected feet.
Page Surgery.

05:56.105 --> 05:58.573
- We'll need IV access.
- Resps are down to 8.

05:58.775 --> 06:01.767
- You want to intubate?
- No. Get me Narcan in a syringe.

06:01.978 --> 06:05.778
Hold the mouth open. I'll inject
sublingually into the vascular bed.

06:05.982 --> 06:08.473
I've paged Dr. Corday.
You're not intubating?

06:08.685 --> 06:10.243
Not if this works.

06:15.325 --> 06:16.690
Come on, little guy.

06:16.893 --> 06:19.726
Let's hear something. Come on.

06:36.512 --> 06:39.743
Second EIKG was normal.
Hold for another hour, then release.

06:40.083 --> 06:41.448
Thank you. Ms. IKnight...

06:41.651 --> 06:44.916
...are you running to get here
because you're 20 minutes late?

06:45.121 --> 06:47.282
- Sorry.
- It's all right. Let's proceed.

06:49.759 --> 06:52.887
With presenting David Chameides.
Complains of back pain.

06:53.096 --> 06:54.324
Yep.

06:55.565 --> 06:59.160
This is a 68-year-old man.
He complains...

06:59.369 --> 07:03.328
He presents with back pain,
said it started two days ago...

07:03.539 --> 07:06.736
...when he helped his daughter
move into her new apartment.

07:06.943 --> 07:09.275
He lifted heavy boxes.
She lived in Dubuque...

07:09.479 --> 07:11.743
...but got divorced,
so she moved to Chicago...

07:11.948 --> 07:14.178
- I mention the pain was constant?
- Not yet.

07:14.384 --> 07:17.353
Well, it is.
And upon physical examination...

07:17.553 --> 07:20.181
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What about pertinent negatives?

07:21.324 --> 07:24.384
No fever, no trauma...

07:24.594 --> 07:26.892
...no abdominal pain, no...

07:28.164 --> 07:30.155
No...

07:30.533 --> 07:32.728
No...

07:33.102 --> 07:34.228
He's a heavy smoker...

07:34.670 --> 07:38.436
...and the BP is one...

07:38.641 --> 07:39.869
Sorry.

07:40.143 --> 07:43.510
BP is 170/95.

07:45.348 --> 07:48.909
No. No, no. His BP is...

07:49.118 --> 07:51.882
...175/100. Pulse, 95.

07:52.088 --> 07:53.715
- Neuro exam normal?
- Yes.

07:53.923 --> 07:57.017
And could you appreciate
a pulsatile abdominal mass?

07:57.593 --> 08:00.892
But the ultrasound revealed
an abdominal aortic aneurysm.

08:01.631 --> 08:03.064
How did you know that?

08:03.266 --> 08:05.564
- Carter?
- Patient has all the risk factors.

08:05.768 --> 08:08.794
Presenting a case is like
telling a good story.

08:09.005 --> 08:11.974
Succinct, focused, to the point.
You lost me in Dubuque.

08:12.175 --> 08:14.871
Dr. Carter, Ms. IKnight
is a student of yours?

08:15.077 --> 08:17.045
- Yes.
- Work harder.

08:17.447 --> 08:20.610
Thank God I have a small bowel
obstruction waiting for me.

08:20.817 --> 08:22.512
Gentlemen, Ms. IKnight.

08:25.354 --> 08:28.517
I think we can all thank God
for that small bowel.

08:31.994 --> 08:34.861
If you're gonna be late,
at least be prepared.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.967
Any idea as to the source of fever?

08:40.169 --> 08:41.193
Probably cellulitis.

08:41.404 --> 08:43.530
- IKerry, Reggie's still here.
- Good.

08:43.739 --> 08:46.333
- We need a photo.
- We have a camera by the desk.

08:46.542 --> 08:49.568
Soon as the IV's in, get him juice
and something to eat.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.804
- Sure.
- Could I have a IKelly?

08:52.882 --> 08:55.578
What sort of parents
would abandon their child?

08:55.785 --> 08:57.753
We don't know that's what happened.

08:57.954 --> 09:01.048
If drugs are in his system,
the parents could be addicts...

09:01.257 --> 09:05.125
...and not even know he's missing.
- Okay. That's lovely.

09:05.428 --> 09:07.896
I've exposed the saphenous vein.
18 angio.

09:08.097 --> 09:11.589
- Is this Baby John Doe?
- Two-year-old. IKerry found him.

09:12.435 --> 09:14.596
Looks good. Jerry said you needed me?

09:14.804 --> 09:17.534
Oh, no, it's nothing important.
I'll find you.

09:17.740 --> 09:21.198
Okay. Oh, I remembered
to bring my tuxedo...

09:21.410 --> 09:24.402
...but left the tickets at home.
Can we stop by on the way?

09:24.947 --> 09:27.745
- Sure. Sounds fine.
- Okay, catch you later.

09:29.919 --> 09:34.720
IV's in. Let's hydrate him with
a bolus of 100 cc's normal saline...

09:34.924 --> 09:39.258
...250 milligrams IV oxacillin,
and put him on a Narcan drip.

09:39.662 --> 09:40.822
Tuxedo?

09:41.964 --> 09:45.331
Yes, it's just some fundraiser
thing we need to go to.

09:51.874 --> 09:54.968
- I can't find that camera anywhere.
- Just find it, Jerry.

09:55.177 --> 09:58.146
- Seen my palmtop computer?
- Is everything missing? No.

09:58.347 --> 10:02.078
That's why you're so scattered?
You lost your electronic cheat sheet?

10:02.285 --> 10:07.052
- When did Antoine Bell come in?
- He asked for you. He's in Trauma 1.

10:07.256 --> 10:11.056
Give me a break. I need sleep,
I was late and my cards got messed up.

10:11.260 --> 10:15.321
I've done a hundred presentations
without notes, computers or sleep.

10:15.531 --> 10:17.726
Get some coffee and get it together.

10:17.934 --> 10:20.402
- I am together. I went off Ritalin.
- When?

10:20.603 --> 10:22.833
- Two days ago.
- That's great.

10:23.039 --> 10:25.667
I got a patient.
Maybe we can talk more later.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.809
- Sure.
- Antoine.

10:28.678 --> 10:31.044
I expected to see you.
Just not like this.

10:31.247 --> 10:33.010
Antoine is not in any gang.

10:33.215 --> 10:34.443
He knows that, Mom.

10:34.650 --> 10:38.416
It was a bad neighborhood boy.
I hate that you attend school with him!

10:38.621 --> 10:42.182
- Can you let Dr. Carter do his job?
- Dr. Carter?

10:42.391 --> 10:46.122
I am so happy to meet you.
He's so enjoyed all you've taught him.

10:46.329 --> 10:48.388
Thank you for setting up
the interview.

10:48.598 --> 10:52.090
Oh, yeah.
That's this afternoon, right?

10:52.301 --> 10:54.565
- Summer science lab.
- Maybe I won't go now.

10:54.770 --> 10:57.705
- Of course you will.
- Like this? What'll they think?

10:57.907 --> 11:01.707
Let's worry about that later, huh?
Tell me what happened.

11:03.145 --> 11:04.806
Got mugged, took my wallet.

11:06.215 --> 11:08.080
Follow my finger with your eyes.

11:08.284 --> 11:10.252
You want an orbital series?

11:12.888 --> 11:14.879
Yeah, let's check for a rim fracture.

11:15.091 --> 11:16.786
- Does that hurt?
- No.

11:16.993 --> 11:19.223
No septal hematoma and no broken nose.

11:19.528 --> 11:22.395
- But you may have an orbital fracture.
- What do we do?

11:22.598 --> 11:25.965
You just apply ice, keep his head
elevated when he sleeps.

11:26.168 --> 11:28.728
We'll wait to see
if he needs antibiotics.

11:28.938 --> 11:34.001
- Well, can he go to the interview?
- Come on, Antoine. It's not that bad.

11:34.644 --> 11:37.943
You've worked hard for this.
We've worked hard for this.

11:38.147 --> 11:39.546
I think your mom's right.

11:40.049 --> 11:42.609
Hey, you'll be the candidate
they'll remember.

11:45.354 --> 11:48.016
There was a man waiting
in the ultrasound place.

11:48.224 --> 11:51.284
I think he's gonna part
with his gallbladder today.

11:51.494 --> 11:54.122
- Really tall guy, red hair?
- Yeah, that's the one.

11:54.330 --> 11:56.890
They took him up to Surgery.
How did you know?

11:57.099 --> 12:00.626
Oh, what a sweet little face!
He's not gonna be crying.

12:00.836 --> 12:03.498
No, don't worry.
I think he'll be pretty quiet.

12:04.373 --> 12:07.672
No, that's what I mean.
He's not gonna be doing any crying.

12:07.877 --> 12:11.108
This is Celinda Randlett.
In for a rule-out appy.

12:11.313 --> 12:13.679
- She's medically empathetic.
- Sorry?

12:14.850 --> 12:17.785
I can tell what's going on
with people. Inside them.

12:17.987 --> 12:19.454
IKind of like a psychic.

12:19.655 --> 12:23.147
I don't predict things. I feel
what's happening in the present.

12:23.359 --> 12:26.055
Started when I was a girl.
Been with me ever since.

12:26.262 --> 12:29.754
But she can't tell about herself.
Maybe appendicitis, maybe not.

12:30.900 --> 12:33.528
It's not like I can treat
anybody for anything.

12:38.040 --> 12:39.837
By the way, when are you due?

12:40.643 --> 12:43.544
- Excuse me?
- I mean, when is your due date?

12:44.580 --> 12:48.607
Oh, right, that. Well, we'll
be expecting in early November.

12:49.385 --> 12:52.081
- Lydia, want to help me with this IV?
- Sure.

12:53.355 --> 12:55.414
- Have you called Psych yet?
- Yeah.

12:55.891 --> 12:58.121
Hi there!

12:58.327 --> 12:59.385
How are you doing?

12:59.595 --> 13:01.825
He's doing pretty good.
He's settling in.

13:02.031 --> 13:05.023
Well, you got a stuffed cow.
That's pretty neat.

13:05.234 --> 13:06.701
Jerry found the camera.

13:06.902 --> 13:10.463
Carol, can you prop his head up
a little bit? There we go.

13:10.673 --> 13:13.665
- Come on, let's sit you up.
- He's been through a lot.

13:13.876 --> 13:18.040
Wandering around by himself
about a block from here, lost.

13:18.247 --> 13:20.306
Oh, he doesn't look lost.

13:20.516 --> 13:21.505
He looks found.

13:21.717 --> 13:24.811
All right. Let me just get one more.

13:28.124 --> 13:31.457
- Hey, where's the roach coach?
- Let's go over to Doc Magoo's.

13:31.660 --> 13:34.254
- You wanted to talk?
- About tonight, actually.

13:34.463 --> 13:36.158
I've never been before...

13:36.365 --> 13:39.823
...but it's a dinner cruise,
swing band, how bad can it be?

13:40.035 --> 13:42.094
Sounds wonderful.
I look forward to it.

13:42.304 --> 13:45.000
It's just we've never
actually talked, you know...

13:45.341 --> 13:46.569
Elizabeth!

13:51.013 --> 13:52.105
You all right?

13:56.418 --> 13:57.908
You okay in there?

13:58.687 --> 14:01.281
- You all right?
- It's okay. We'll help you.

14:01.490 --> 14:03.219
My dad. Please help my dad!

14:03.425 --> 14:04.983
It's okay. It's all right.

14:05.194 --> 14:07.890
We need a couple of gurneys out here!

14:12.701 --> 14:14.999
- He's had four of Ativan.
- Give him two more.

14:15.204 --> 14:19.538
- Good breath sounds.
- BP's 125/75. Pulse 100.

14:19.742 --> 14:23.644
No signs of abdominal trauma. Get an
ultrasound, see if he's bleeding.

14:23.846 --> 14:25.905
The pupils are equal and reactive.

14:26.115 --> 14:28.413
There we go. That's more like it.

14:28.617 --> 14:30.585
Load him with a gram of Dilantin.

14:30.786 --> 14:33.016
- He needs a C-spine and a head CT.
- Got it.

14:33.222 --> 14:36.191
- No evidence of abdominal bleeding.
- That's a good sign.

14:36.392 --> 14:38.326
I'm gonna go talk to his daughter.

14:39.428 --> 14:41.623
Hi. I'm Dr. Greene.

14:41.831 --> 14:43.458
- How are you doing?
- Okay.

14:43.666 --> 14:45.930
Your dad's doing okay too.

14:46.468 --> 14:48.265
Ms. IKnight, fill me in.

14:48.470 --> 14:51.803
- This is Sarah... Sorry. Sarah...
- Bengossi.

14:52.007 --> 14:56.205
Bengossi. And she's 10.
She has facial lacerations...

14:56.412 --> 14:59.245
...bruise to her forehead,
normal cranial nerve exam.

14:59.448 --> 15:02.747
No loss of consciousness.
She had a car accident outside the ER.

15:02.952 --> 15:06.080
- She was driving.
- I know about that part, don't I?

15:06.789 --> 15:08.814
So did you ask her what happened?

15:09.725 --> 15:11.124
Car accident.

15:12.228 --> 15:15.425
And she said she hit
the El or something.

15:15.631 --> 15:19.567
Call me crazy, but you're too young
to drive, aren't you?

15:19.768 --> 15:21.895
- Yeah.
- Not that you're not a good driver.

15:22.104 --> 15:25.540
That El stanchion just jumped out
in the middle, didn't it?

15:27.109 --> 15:28.701
Something happen to your dad?

15:28.911 --> 15:32.642
Well, he has epilepsy.
He hasn't had a seizure in two years.

15:32.848 --> 15:36.579
When that happens, I know what to do.
He and Mom taught us.

15:36.986 --> 15:41.446
- He was driving, so you took the wheel?
- It was hard to reach the pedals.

15:41.657 --> 15:44.182
You thought fast enough
to get him to the ER.

15:44.693 --> 15:46.786
We brought my brother here last week.

15:46.996 --> 15:49.191
He fell and broke his collarbone.

15:49.398 --> 15:51.832
Well, you did a great job, Sarah.

15:52.034 --> 15:54.969
When I tell my 10-year-old
that you got to drive...

15:55.170 --> 15:57.900
...she is gonna be so jealous.

15:58.107 --> 16:01.975
Yosh, why don't you get that cut
cleaned up and let her see her dad?

16:02.411 --> 16:05.471
- Sure. No problem.
- Lucy, come with me.

16:06.982 --> 16:09.212
I was going to ask her what happened.

16:09.418 --> 16:11.978
Then you walked in
and asked me if I knew what...

16:12.187 --> 16:14.348
Hold up! What's going on?
Are you okay?

16:14.556 --> 16:17.525
- I'm definitely fine.
- You didn't seem definitely fine...

16:17.726 --> 16:22.527
...when you presented to Dr. Romano.
And I've seen you handle kids better.

16:22.731 --> 16:27.293
- I didn't get much sleep last night...
- You'll get even less as a Resident.

16:27.503 --> 16:29.630
You gotta learn to deal with it.

16:33.742 --> 16:35.903
Jeanie, I was looking for you.

16:36.111 --> 16:37.442
Did they find anything?

16:37.646 --> 16:39.443
No kids reported missing.

16:39.648 --> 16:41.548
- And the neighborhood?
- Nothing yet.

16:41.750 --> 16:45.117
- I'll let you know if I hear anything.
- I'll fill IKerry in.

16:45.321 --> 16:48.415
- Going back to work?
- All the POs in the area got called.

16:48.624 --> 16:52.116
Some lunatic is standing on
a van on Madison, waving a.45.

16:52.328 --> 16:55.559
- Shooting at people?
- No, threatening to kill himself.

16:56.765 --> 16:58.426
- Catch you later.
- Okay.

16:58.634 --> 17:01.626
- Thanks for the ride this morning.
- My pleasure.

17:03.973 --> 17:05.270
We have to use a code?

17:05.473 --> 17:07.031
All calls get charged to it?

17:07.242 --> 17:09.675
- So if I use the code for my home...
- Good luck.

17:09.877 --> 17:11.675
I could use a little help here.

17:11.880 --> 17:12.868
Hello. ER.

17:13.082 --> 17:14.310
No, she's not here.

17:14.516 --> 17:18.077
Okay. "McLucas has to cancel.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.944
Call to reschedule."
Okay, I'll tell her.

17:21.156 --> 17:23.181
- Anyone see Carol?
- She's in Curtain 3.

17:23.392 --> 17:26.361
Her appointment's canceled.
She needs to call McLucas.

17:26.561 --> 17:29.895
Oh, I know her. She was Conni's OB
when she had her baby.

17:31.266 --> 17:32.255
Did you say baby?

17:32.468 --> 17:34.368
- You think...
- Pop Tart in the toaster?

17:34.570 --> 17:37.300
That empathetic woman
did ask about her due date.

17:37.506 --> 17:39.940
You hear anything
about Carol being pregnant?

17:40.142 --> 17:42.303
- By Doug Ross?
- I'm sure it would be Doug.

17:42.511 --> 17:47.505
McLucas is also a GYN. Maybe Carol
has a checkup or a yeast infection.

17:47.716 --> 17:48.705
- What is it?
- Jerry.

17:48.917 --> 17:51.283
- They think Carol's knocked up.
- Is she happy?

17:51.487 --> 17:54.388
- She hasn't told anyone.
- She must've told someone.

18:00.095 --> 18:01.119
What?

18:01.463 --> 18:02.623
How's he doing?

18:02.831 --> 18:03.820
He's doing great.

18:04.099 --> 18:07.091
I can't get him to tell me his name.
He's not a talker.

18:07.302 --> 18:09.998
The police haven't come up
with anything yet.

18:10.806 --> 18:13.172
How can you not know
where your child is?

18:13.375 --> 18:16.037
Labs came back.
He tested positive for opiates.

18:16.245 --> 18:18.543
Great. Drugs lying around the house.

18:18.747 --> 18:22.740
I mean, if he was crying a lot,
maybe they gave him something...

18:22.951 --> 18:25.511
...to quiet him down. I don't know.

18:25.888 --> 18:28.584
- I'll look in on him later, okay?
- Okay.

18:30.292 --> 18:31.520
He's all right now.

18:32.194 --> 18:36.187
But there's still something inside
of him. I just don't know what.

18:36.398 --> 18:38.525
Well, he has an infection.
Cellulitis.

18:40.269 --> 18:41.896
No, that's not it.

18:45.607 --> 18:48.872
So anyway, have you started
thinking about names?

18:49.078 --> 18:51.740
That's the hard part.
Everybody's got an opinion.

18:54.550 --> 18:57.678
You are in a family way?
As my grandmother used to say.

18:57.886 --> 18:59.478
How could you tell?

19:00.923 --> 19:04.620
Like I said, I'm sensitive
to what's going on with people.

19:08.197 --> 19:11.530
Like that gentleman over there,
I'm sad to say...

19:11.733 --> 19:13.291
...has leukemia.

19:14.703 --> 19:16.762
You could have looked at his chart.

19:17.473 --> 19:20.067
That's right. I could have.

19:22.644 --> 19:26.080
The odd thing is, I can't tell
if you're having a boy or a girl.

19:26.648 --> 19:29.617
Oh, well, I'm just beginning
my second trimester, so...

19:30.018 --> 19:33.010
No. I can usually tell
long before that.

19:34.990 --> 19:37.458
So you've had this gift
your whole life?

19:38.127 --> 19:40.595
Well, it doesn't seem
like much of a gift...

19:40.796 --> 19:43.663
...when I see a gentleman like that.

19:51.573 --> 19:52.699
What?

19:54.076 --> 19:55.270
Nothing.

19:59.648 --> 20:01.240
Carla. I'm sorry I'm late.

20:01.450 --> 20:05.978
It's okay. I'm glad you called.
I needed to talk to you.

20:07.489 --> 20:09.980
Look, I know haven't...

20:10.192 --> 20:14.322
I haven't spoken to you about Roger
working with Reece on language...

20:14.530 --> 20:17.294
...and Martha called
and told me about this morning.

20:17.499 --> 20:19.990
Look, I was angry at first.

20:20.202 --> 20:23.603
But I know you know
the more anybody works with him...

20:23.805 --> 20:26.672
...the quicker he's gonna learn.
So it's okay.

20:29.611 --> 20:30.873
Peter...

20:32.114 --> 20:34.241
...Roger and I got
married last weekend.

20:35.717 --> 20:36.741
Wow!

20:37.519 --> 20:39.419
There's a lot you haven't told me.

20:41.723 --> 20:45.056
His company is transferring him
to Germany. Hamburg.

20:45.260 --> 20:49.196
I'm gonna sell the restaurant.
And we're going.

20:49.831 --> 20:51.526
And I'm taking Reece with us.

20:52.067 --> 20:53.534
Carla, what are you...?

20:56.238 --> 20:59.036
We're not gonna even
have this conversation.

20:59.641 --> 21:01.666
There's no way I'll let that happen.

21:01.877 --> 21:04.903
He'll have to be with one of us,
and I'm his mother.

21:05.614 --> 21:07.445
This will happen!

21:08.584 --> 21:10.916
- Do you have a minute?
- You wanted to talk.

21:11.119 --> 21:13.986
I've moved Mr. Bengossi
and Sarah into Exam 4.

21:14.189 --> 21:16.214
That's what you wanted to talk about?

21:19.094 --> 21:20.721
No time like the present.

21:20.929 --> 21:22.191
All right.

21:22.397 --> 21:24.661
I want to talk about, you know...

21:24.866 --> 21:27.027
...what's been going on
between us lately.

21:27.236 --> 21:29.033
Something been going on?

21:29.671 --> 21:31.263
Come on, we'll talk in here.

21:31.473 --> 21:33.964
It's no big deal or anything.
It's just that...

21:34.176 --> 21:36.872
- Carol?
- Damn! I thought I locked that door.

21:37.346 --> 21:39.871
- What are you doing?
- An ultrasound.

21:40.082 --> 21:42.073
- On yourself?
- Yes, Mark.

21:42.284 --> 21:46.345
My doctor's appointment canceled,
and no one was using the equipment.

21:46.555 --> 21:50.116
- Well, why don't you let us do it?
- Lf you must.

21:51.526 --> 21:52.857
Let me get it.

21:53.061 --> 21:55.962
Is it too early to tell
if it's a girl or a boy?

21:56.164 --> 21:58.394
It's never too early to be inaccurate.

22:01.570 --> 22:04.061
- There's the heartbeat.
- Any turtle sign?

22:05.440 --> 22:06.702
Looking.

22:08.443 --> 22:09.876
Okay.

22:12.614 --> 22:14.206
There's the...

22:14.549 --> 22:16.107
- Mark?
- Uh-huh.

22:17.219 --> 22:20.017
What? Mark, what?

22:20.689 --> 22:22.020
Heartbeat.

22:22.224 --> 22:24.818
Yes, Mark. Elizabeth already
said that. What?

22:25.327 --> 22:28.194
What he means is,
there's another heartbeat.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.032
Twins?

22:48.216 --> 22:50.616
What's up with Malik?
He's got a big grin.

22:50.819 --> 22:52.286
He knows nothing.

22:52.521 --> 22:55.490
I mean, he's just
a naturally happy person.

22:55.691 --> 22:58.091
- That's Malik.
- Downright inspiring.

22:58.293 --> 23:01.023
And infectious. I'm happy too.

23:01.229 --> 23:05.598
Could somebody please tell me what
the hell's going on with these phones?

23:05.801 --> 23:08.201
Dr. Romano instituted a code system...

23:08.403 --> 23:10.871
...so people don't make
so many personal calls.

23:11.073 --> 23:13.268
- A code system?
- Yes, sir.

23:14.376 --> 23:16.970
IKid ditched school only
to ride his bike into a bus.

23:17.179 --> 23:18.578
Life is not fair. Lucy?

23:18.780 --> 23:20.407
X-ray shows a fractured ankle.

23:20.615 --> 23:21.843
- What kind?
- Comminuted.

23:22.050 --> 23:23.677
Trimalleolar. Which needs...

23:23.885 --> 23:27.514
- Open reduction and internal fix...
- We got a double trauma coming.

23:27.723 --> 23:30.055
Two GSWs.
Officer and the man who shot him.

23:30.258 --> 23:32.624
- What happened?
- A guy waving a.45 around.

23:32.828 --> 23:36.161
- Police got him.
- Find Carter or Weaver. Let's set up.

23:39.601 --> 23:43.059
Carol, did you...?
Did you notice this before?

23:43.839 --> 23:44.828
Here.

23:46.074 --> 23:47.871
Looks like a scar from surgery.

23:48.076 --> 23:50.567
It's okay.
We're just looking you over.

23:51.179 --> 23:53.306
Yes. All right.

23:53.515 --> 23:54.982
Let's just look you over.

23:56.651 --> 23:57.640
He's got a shunt.

23:58.787 --> 24:01.483
From the ventricles in his brain...

24:02.290 --> 24:04.315
...to his peritoneum.

24:04.760 --> 24:06.853
He was probably born
with hydrocephalus.

24:07.496 --> 24:08.485
What's a shunt?

24:08.897 --> 24:11.991
It's like a small tube
that runs through the body.

24:12.534 --> 24:14.468
It drains excess fluid.

24:15.404 --> 24:18.601
That must be what I've been
feeling inside him then.

24:19.441 --> 24:21.102
Carol, please. Would you?

24:22.844 --> 24:26.541
- I'm sorry.
- It's no problem. Mystery solved.

24:28.316 --> 24:31.410
He could have a shunt infection.
We need to do a tap.

24:31.620 --> 24:33.485
- Go bye-bye?
- Yeah.

24:33.688 --> 24:36.213
Yeah. You want to go
bye-bye, don't you?

24:38.393 --> 24:39.382
Where's the officer?

24:39.594 --> 24:41.994
- The cop?
- Another unit took him to Mercy.

24:42.197 --> 24:45.030
About 40 years old.
Two GSWs to the left chest.

24:45.233 --> 24:48.066
Full arrest. Two lines in.
Weak pulse then lost it.

24:48.270 --> 24:51.239
- Agonal rhythm on the scope.
- I'm checking on an officer...

24:51.440 --> 24:54.068
Lucy, I'll show you how
to put in an atrial line.

24:55.377 --> 24:56.708
Thoracotomy tray.

24:56.912 --> 24:59.745
Sorry to barge in.
Lucy, I got a call from Psych.

24:59.948 --> 25:02.746
- You were to see a kid 20 minutes ago?
- Seth Willows.

25:02.951 --> 25:06.011
- You'd better go.
- They said Mercy. Please check again.

25:06.221 --> 25:09.213
- Asystole on the monitor!
- I'll take over bagging.

25:09.424 --> 25:11.688
Squeeze in that O-neg
as fast as you can.

25:11.893 --> 25:13.383
Rib spreader.

25:14.095 --> 25:15.756
I need suction.

25:23.004 --> 25:26.735
- Lap pad. Left ventricle is shredded.
- Give me a sponge stick.

25:28.643 --> 25:31.203
Second shot transected
the ascending aorta.

25:31.413 --> 25:33.108
Two units in. Still asystole.

25:34.449 --> 25:37.976
That's it.
There's nothing we can do here.

25:38.186 --> 25:39.551
I'm calling it.

25:40.622 --> 25:42.351
Time of death, 1509.

25:47.429 --> 25:48.691
Reggie!

25:48.997 --> 25:49.986
He didn't make it?

25:52.200 --> 25:53.292
Not even close.

25:55.170 --> 25:57.263
We heard that an officer was shot.

25:58.139 --> 26:00.437
Bullet grazed his shoulder.
He'll be okay.

26:02.177 --> 26:04.475
Well, it could've been much worse.

26:05.247 --> 26:07.841
Carter, let's go talk
about your student.

26:14.022 --> 26:16.047
So it was you who shot him?

26:22.831 --> 26:24.321
Hey, Seth.

26:24.699 --> 26:26.257
I'm so sorry I'm late.

26:26.468 --> 26:29.835
A trauma came into the ER
and I got delayed.

26:31.072 --> 26:33.063
Okay, that's not true. I forgot.

26:33.275 --> 26:34.867
And I'm really sorry.

26:36.444 --> 26:37.672
Seth?

26:39.481 --> 26:40.971
- Seth?
- What?!

26:41.182 --> 26:43.047
What?! What?! What?! What?!

26:43.251 --> 26:44.582
Please!

26:45.353 --> 26:47.048
Can we just talk about this?

26:48.023 --> 26:50.082
I don't feel like talking right now.

26:59.234 --> 27:01.930
I know you're angry.
You have every right to be.

27:09.477 --> 27:11.468
I do need to get on there soon.

27:11.680 --> 27:13.045
In a minute, Jer.

27:13.248 --> 27:15.910
Don't we have a
lost-and-now-it's-ours box?

27:16.117 --> 27:18.551
- Yeah. Right here.
- Oh, thanks.

27:18.753 --> 27:22.018
The police find anything on the boy?
I hear he has a shunt.

27:22.223 --> 27:26.922
No. I'm e-mailing his info and photo
to all board-certified neurosurgeons.

27:27.128 --> 27:28.117
All of them?

27:28.330 --> 27:30.958
There's only 380
that specialize in pediatrics.

27:31.166 --> 27:33.691
Hopefully, someone will recognize him.

27:33.902 --> 27:36.598
Three hundred and eighty?
Which one are you on?

27:36.805 --> 27:38.466
You ready to take a break?

27:38.673 --> 27:42.268
I wish. I've got a vegetectomy
and a valvuloplasty with Romano.

27:42.477 --> 27:46.573
- How are you taking the news?
- I'm in denial, but thanks for asking.

27:46.781 --> 27:48.510
Mark, what are you doing?

27:48.717 --> 27:51.083
I have a woman who has arthritis.

27:51.286 --> 27:53.516
I had to cut her wedding ring off.

27:53.722 --> 27:56.657
I glued it back together
and I'm putting it on a chain...

27:56.858 --> 27:58.485
...so she can still wear it.

27:58.693 --> 28:01.253
- That's very sweet.
- I thought she'd like it.

28:01.463 --> 28:03.294
- I'll catch you later.
- Uh-huh.

28:11.172 --> 28:12.833
Mark, what's that movie called...

28:13.041 --> 28:16.306
...where all the people turn
into some kind of a pod?

28:16.511 --> 28:17.500
What?

28:17.712 --> 28:20.078
His life was in his own hands,
not yours.

28:20.281 --> 28:22.442
There must've been 20 cops out there.

28:22.651 --> 28:25.745
I don't know.
My patrol car was closest?

28:26.521 --> 28:28.614
It was just random, I guess.

28:30.125 --> 28:33.458
Well, I don't think I believe
in "random" anymore.

28:35.797 --> 28:39.358
When I told you that
I was seeing someone else...

28:39.567 --> 28:41.933
...that wasn't the complete truth.

28:48.576 --> 28:51.443
I had just found out
that I have hepatitis C.

28:53.448 --> 28:56.440
I'm responding to medication.
It's under control.

28:56.718 --> 28:58.913
You didn't think I could handle that?

28:59.120 --> 29:01.179
I couldn't handle it.

29:02.724 --> 29:04.123
I kept thinking, "Why me?

29:04.325 --> 29:06.759
Why this on top of everything else?"

29:07.462 --> 29:11.990
But after a while, I came to see
that I wasn't sick. I was healed.

29:14.369 --> 29:16.269
I don't think I'm getting this.

29:16.638 --> 29:19.573
God kept throwing things
at me until I realized...

29:19.774 --> 29:21.765
...it's not about what happens to us.

29:21.976 --> 29:24.536
It's about how we deal
with what happens to us.

29:25.380 --> 29:28.406
We have choices.
Our lives are in our own hands.

29:29.584 --> 29:32.815
So you think what happened
was some kind of message for me?

29:33.021 --> 29:35.751
Maybe what happened today
didn't happen to you.

29:35.957 --> 29:37.584
Maybe it happened "for" you.

29:41.396 --> 29:43.523
Yeah, I understand what you're saying.

29:45.033 --> 29:47.433
I'm not sure it makes me
feel any better.

29:49.571 --> 29:51.402
Sitting here feels pretty good.

29:52.774 --> 29:54.264
Yeah, it does.

30:03.251 --> 30:05.981
You're awfully quiet, Peter.
Bad mood?

30:06.187 --> 30:07.279
Just working.

30:07.489 --> 30:09.650
A surgeon's nimble fingers
toiling away.

30:09.858 --> 30:11.382
Suction, please.

30:11.593 --> 30:14.994
I know you didn't expect to
assist today. Hope you don't mind.

30:15.196 --> 30:16.185
Of course not.

30:16.397 --> 30:19.798
This might well be Dr. Benton's
last cardiothoracic surgery.

30:20.502 --> 30:22.367
Vegetation removed. 6-O Prolene.

30:22.570 --> 30:25.869
It's a shame you can't use
all that hard-earned knowledge...

30:26.074 --> 30:30.977
...while you're doing trauma scut.
Lizzie, you've actually been spared.

30:31.513 --> 30:34.073
Peter was chosen fairly.
I've made my peace.

30:34.282 --> 30:38.685
An excellent attitude. Which is why
we should keep you on here at County.

30:38.887 --> 30:41.355
Either with cardiothoracic
or something else.

30:41.556 --> 30:44.957
That's something you're still
thinking about, and you should.

30:45.160 --> 30:46.457
After all...

30:47.028 --> 30:49.519
...that's what any good
candidate would do.

30:51.699 --> 30:53.894
Someone's calling
about that little boy.

30:54.102 --> 30:55.797
Chuny, can you stay with him?

30:56.004 --> 30:58.063
I need you to look at that patient.

30:58.273 --> 30:59.433
- Yeah, okay.
- Thank you.

31:01.309 --> 31:05.143
- Antoine, the same kid jump you again?
- No.

31:05.346 --> 31:08.179
- Was it somebody else from school?
- It's the same dude.

31:08.383 --> 31:09.748
I jumped him.

31:09.951 --> 31:12.613
The kid from this morning?
You went after him?

31:12.921 --> 31:16.084
He took my wallet, man!
I can't be letting that go down.

31:17.125 --> 31:19.889
Why not? What did you lose?
Ten, 15 bucks?

31:21.062 --> 31:22.654
He sounds like my mom.

31:22.864 --> 31:25.958
BP's 128/74. Pulse 96.

31:26.167 --> 31:28.931
Got any pain in your belly?
Get hit in the stomach?

31:29.137 --> 31:31.332
No, he only got me in the face.

31:34.709 --> 31:38.236
Colles with dorsal angulation.
He'll need a closed reduction.

31:38.446 --> 31:40.778
- What's that?
- You broke your left wrist.

31:42.183 --> 31:43.616
Can you feel this?

31:44.319 --> 31:45.308
Yeah.

31:45.520 --> 31:48.819
- What kind of sutures do you want?
- 5-O Vicryl, 6-O nylon.

31:49.424 --> 31:50.652
I gotta have stitches?

31:50.959 --> 31:53.792
Fifth metacarpal fracture
with rotational deformity.

31:53.995 --> 31:55.462
You broke both your hands.

31:55.997 --> 31:57.988
Let's get an orbital series.

31:58.199 --> 32:01.691
Call Ortho because that one's
gonna have to be pinned in the O.R.

32:02.136 --> 32:05.071
- I gotta have an operation?
- That's right.

32:05.707 --> 32:08.198
Well, you wanted to blow off
your interview.

32:11.246 --> 32:12.577
I can go in a few days.

32:12.780 --> 32:16.477
You're not getting into
any summer science lab. Not now.

32:17.485 --> 32:21.114
You have to go to surgery,
have a pin put into your right hand.

32:21.356 --> 32:24.052
You'll get a cast that goes
from elbow to fingers.

32:24.359 --> 32:27.123
- I can still go to class.
- It's a hands-on program.

32:27.328 --> 32:31.128
You won't have use of your hands.
You won't be able to dress yourself...

32:31.332 --> 32:34.893
...tie your own shoe or blow your
own nose for the next six weeks.

32:35.403 --> 32:37.132
- Well, it's not your problem.
- No?!

32:37.338 --> 32:40.307
I'm the one that's spent time
showing you around...

32:40.508 --> 32:43.204
...for the last month,
trying to teach you something.

32:43.411 --> 32:47.245
So you can go and screw it up
by having to go beat down some punk.

32:47.448 --> 32:49.882
- You don't know!
- I know it dragged you away...

32:50.084 --> 32:52.279
...from the best opportunity
you've ever had.

32:52.487 --> 32:55.923
No one gave me anything.
I earned that chance myself!

32:56.891 --> 32:58.756
You just blew it, all by yourself.

32:58.960 --> 33:00.222
- Dr. Carter!
- Yes, Chuny?

33:01.229 --> 33:03.060
Don't forget to call Ortho.

33:05.800 --> 33:08.894
- Jerry, any word on the kid?
- Just one call for Dr. Weaver.

33:09.103 --> 33:12.834
It was the grocer I met this morning.
He called to see what had happened.

33:13.041 --> 33:16.135
Labs came back. The shunt's not
causing the infection.

33:16.344 --> 33:18.437
Maybe it's the cellulitis.

33:18.813 --> 33:21.373
Do you think his parents left him
because of the shunt?

33:21.582 --> 33:24.574
- What?
- I mean, you know, because...

33:24.986 --> 33:27.955
...he wasn't normal.
Something was wrong with him.

33:28.156 --> 33:30.317
I hate to think so,
but anything's possible.

33:30.525 --> 33:32.356
I'm gonna go check on him.

33:40.034 --> 33:43.094
Seth, we'll see you next week.
Is your mom here?

33:43.304 --> 33:44.862
She's my foster mom.

33:45.206 --> 33:47.868
- Okay, see you.
- Bye, Seth.

33:49.043 --> 33:50.533
I'm sorry I had to call you.

33:51.079 --> 33:53.479
I'm glad you recognized
it was over your head.

33:53.681 --> 33:56.479
- A lot of students can't admit that.
- I really blew it.

33:56.684 --> 34:00.381
A kid like Seth, alcoholic father,
been bounced around a lot.

34:00.588 --> 34:02.749
You can expect a lot of setbacks.

34:02.957 --> 34:07.087
I caused this setback. I was 20
minutes late for our meeting today.

34:07.795 --> 34:11.025
Well, that is something
that cannot happen again.

34:11.498 --> 34:13.330
It won't. I won't let it.

34:17.804 --> 34:20.239
Now from the sublime
to the utterly mundane.

34:20.440 --> 34:23.706
But then, the appendectomy is
our bread and butter, no?

34:23.911 --> 34:26.004
Maybe not, if I do cardiothoracic.

34:26.813 --> 34:29.612
Yeah? So, what do you think?

34:31.085 --> 34:34.282
You're a bastard for mentioning it
in front of Peter.

34:34.489 --> 34:36.821
- He's a big boy.
- It was mean.

34:37.025 --> 34:39.458
Well, he was mean to me first.

34:41.062 --> 34:44.395
He led me on to think he wanted
cardiothoracic and then took trauma.

34:44.766 --> 34:47.132
It was bad form
to speak to one colleague...

34:47.335 --> 34:49.360
...in front of another
about a sensitive matter.

34:49.570 --> 34:51.400
Jeez, talk about being sensitive.

34:51.606 --> 34:52.868
- Robert.
- Donald!

34:53.074 --> 34:57.135
- How was your Whipple, you lucky dog?
- A long six hours, that's how.

34:57.345 --> 34:59.404
Which is why I couldn't
find you earlier.

35:00.148 --> 35:03.811
You initiated this code phone system
down in the ER?

35:04.018 --> 35:06.282
- Yes, sir.
- For what purpose?

35:06.487 --> 35:09.547
So patients' families can't sneak
in calls to Hoboken.

35:09.957 --> 35:11.891
Which is not a big problem.

35:12.093 --> 35:14.755
Want to know what is?
Employee personal calls.

35:14.962 --> 35:17.453
This allows us to track
outgoing calls.

35:17.665 --> 35:20.293
That way we don't have
to wait for the phone bills.

35:20.501 --> 35:23.561
I see. "Big Brother is watching"
kind of thing.

35:23.771 --> 35:25.170
"Monitoring" is a better word.

35:25.373 --> 35:30.675
Have you no respect for those who work
here for long hours and not much pay?

35:33.047 --> 35:34.912
- I don't see it that way.
- I do.

35:35.383 --> 35:38.409
If you'd be so kind as to take
your code phone system...

35:38.619 --> 35:40.519
...and put it where the sun...
- Got it.

35:42.256 --> 35:43.382
Good.

35:51.799 --> 35:53.198
Point taken.

35:56.037 --> 35:58.835
- That's really exciting.
- A new little voice in the world.

35:59.040 --> 36:02.203
Carol hasn't told anyone,
so pretend like you don't know.

36:02.410 --> 36:04.469
Okay. I won't say anything.

36:17.725 --> 36:20.091
- Sorry!
- Oh, man!

36:21.129 --> 36:23.097
- Carter...
- Look!

36:23.598 --> 36:24.587
I'm sorry.

36:24.799 --> 36:28.633
I think it's great that you
went off the Ritalin. I really do.

36:28.836 --> 36:31.532
But I can't hold your hand
through this.

36:31.739 --> 36:34.435
I wouldn't ask you to.
I know you're not capable of it.

36:34.642 --> 36:37.008
- What does that mean?
- You don't like me.

36:37.211 --> 36:38.701
I've never been up to your standards.

36:38.913 --> 36:41.313
I want you to be a better student
and to succeed.

36:41.516 --> 36:42.505
That's what you think.

36:42.717 --> 36:45.584
You're the one who wants
to succeed as a teacher.

36:45.786 --> 36:48.983
And in order for that to happen...

36:49.190 --> 36:52.421
...I would have to be the perfect
reflection of you.

36:52.627 --> 36:53.821
I have a patient.

37:00.001 --> 37:02.094
I'm dropping these off
for Dr. Weintraub.

37:02.303 --> 37:06.399
Peter, I think Rocket was a complete
ass for doing what he did in the O.R.

37:06.607 --> 37:10.236
- He can do whatever he wants.
- Well, not entirely, but...

37:10.444 --> 37:14.175
It doesn't matter, Elizabeth.
Cardiothoracic, trauma.

37:14.382 --> 37:16.475
I don't care about any of it anymore.

37:16.684 --> 37:18.618
Hang on. What do you mean?

37:20.454 --> 37:23.252
Carla came to see me today.
She married Roger.

37:23.457 --> 37:26.255
She wants to take Reece
and move to Germany.

37:26.460 --> 37:28.587
Something about Roger's job.

37:28.796 --> 37:32.232
Well, she can't. I mean, legally
she can't do that, can she?

37:32.433 --> 37:35.402
Yeah, well, she won't get
the chance to.

37:35.603 --> 37:36.695
Hey, Carol?

37:36.904 --> 37:38.838
This fax just came in for you.

37:39.340 --> 37:43.401
Thanks, Jerry.
By the way, I know you know.

37:43.611 --> 37:44.737
IKnow what?

37:45.146 --> 37:49.105
I know nothing. I'm a complete
walking lack of information.

37:49.317 --> 37:50.477
Oh, man!

37:50.685 --> 37:52.778
Carol, it's for you.

37:53.921 --> 37:55.548
This is Carol Hathaway.

37:56.257 --> 37:59.021
Yeah! You're doing
so much better, huh?

37:59.227 --> 38:01.161
IKind of a big day.

38:01.362 --> 38:06.197
You want some juice?
I got some apple juice here.

38:06.400 --> 38:09.927
My name is IKerry.
Can you tell me your name?

38:10.171 --> 38:11.297
Jack.

38:12.306 --> 38:13.796
Jack Toberen.

38:16.477 --> 38:19.071
So that's your name, little guy?
Jack?

38:19.280 --> 38:22.875
Wow! What a great name, Jack, huh?

38:23.084 --> 38:26.349
- You got a response?
- A pediatric neurosurgeon.

38:26.554 --> 38:29.421
He recognized the photo.
He put the shunt in.

38:29.624 --> 38:32.252
He saw Jack about two months ago.

38:32.460 --> 38:34.655
- He called the parents.
- They coming in?

38:34.862 --> 38:38.559
Oh, yeah, in a big hurry. I just
spoke to the mother on the phone.

38:38.766 --> 38:41.963
- Jack was kidnapped three weeks ago.
- What?

38:42.169 --> 38:46.697
Unreal, huh? By the nanny
and the drugged-out boyfriend.

38:46.907 --> 38:49.068
They must've been the ones
who abandoned him.

38:49.277 --> 38:50.835
- I guess so.
- There you go.

38:51.045 --> 38:53.172
The police are on their way in.

38:54.015 --> 38:56.483
So now we know
who you are, Jack.

38:58.286 --> 39:02.450
Your mom and dad are coming in,
and you get to go home.

39:02.657 --> 39:04.022
Yeah.

39:05.593 --> 39:06.787
All right.

39:09.563 --> 39:10.655
- Hey.
- Hey, Lizette.

39:10.865 --> 39:12.594
Carla won't be home until 7:30.

39:12.800 --> 39:15.735
Actually, it might even be later.
Maybe not until 10.

39:15.936 --> 39:17.096
Hey, man!

39:18.139 --> 39:21.734
- She didn't tell me she'd be late.
- I told her I'd tell you.

39:21.942 --> 39:26.402
I don't have to take Reece. Carla was
sure you would have plans tonight.

39:26.614 --> 39:28.741
I was planning to go
to the Quartz Lounge.

39:28.949 --> 39:31.008
I've been seeing this trumpet player.

39:31.218 --> 39:32.845
- Oh, a musician, huh?
- Yeah.

39:33.054 --> 39:34.817
You'd better watch yourself.

39:35.022 --> 39:36.250
Say "bye," Reece.

39:37.024 --> 39:38.491
- Bye, Reece.
- Say "bye."

39:38.693 --> 39:40.854
Bye-bye. Bye.

39:42.263 --> 39:46.563
So is your mom more or less pissed off
than I imagine she is?

39:47.435 --> 39:48.868
More or less than you?

39:49.603 --> 39:50.661
That's fair.

39:53.341 --> 39:55.571
She acts like I'll never play
the violin again.

39:57.745 --> 39:59.337
That's pretty funny.

39:59.814 --> 40:01.907
I heard it in a stupid TV movie.

40:02.917 --> 40:04.885
Why are you watching TV
when you got homework?

40:05.086 --> 40:07.213
Oh, man! You are my mom.

40:08.789 --> 40:10.313
I don't know about that.

40:11.492 --> 40:13.551
I think I want the best for you.

40:14.662 --> 40:19.656
I suspect that she does a better job
of appreciating you for who you are.

40:20.935 --> 40:23.096
As long as I grow up
to be just like her.

40:23.471 --> 40:27.407
I know that routine. My family wanted
me to grow up to be a rich, white guy.

40:28.142 --> 40:30.474
Damn, they must be dancing!

40:30.678 --> 40:32.236
You don't make money in the ER.

40:32.446 --> 40:34.744
They figure they'd settle
on two out of three.

40:37.118 --> 40:40.952
- I'm sorry I blew the summer thing.
- You'll get another chance.

40:41.489 --> 40:44.686
I mean now I'll be spending
my time bagging groceries.

40:44.892 --> 40:47.520
Actually, I'm not even sure
you'll be doing that.

40:50.698 --> 40:52.495
I'll be here when you get out.

40:55.336 --> 40:58.703
- We'll still make it.
- This is worth staying for.

40:58.906 --> 41:00.897
- Carol!
- Wow, you two look great.

41:01.409 --> 41:03.877
- I'll walk out with you.
- I have to check on a chart.

41:04.078 --> 41:05.909
Return a phone call.

41:06.981 --> 41:09.074
Okay. Good night.

41:11.118 --> 41:13.245
Surprise!

41:14.121 --> 41:15.782
- We got you.
- She got us.

41:15.990 --> 41:19.391
- What are you doing?
- You haven't told us about the baby...

41:19.593 --> 41:23.927
- We couldn't sit on it another minute.
- We wanted you to know we're so happy.

41:24.131 --> 41:26.827
- We'll get you something better...
- But for now...

41:27.535 --> 41:28.763
Oh, man!

41:32.173 --> 41:35.142
- Carol, you need a Lamaze coach?
- You're it, Malik.

41:36.243 --> 41:37.505
This is amazing.

41:38.479 --> 41:41.505
I've just been overwhelmed
with this news myself.

41:41.715 --> 41:44.275
Today I found out I'm having twins.

41:47.788 --> 41:49.813
I didn't know when
or how to tell people.

41:50.024 --> 41:54.518
And I'm really glad that I can share
this with you now. So thank you.

41:54.728 --> 41:56.821
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations!

42:12.746 --> 42:16.773
<i>You've reached Peter. Please leave</i>
<i>a message after the tone.</i>

42:17.551 --> 42:22.545
<i>Peter, are you there?</i>
<i>Is Reece there with you? Peter?</i>

42:24.124 --> 42:26.115
<i>Peter, what are you doing?</i>

42:26.327 --> 42:29.125
<i>You know darn well Reece</i>
<i>is supposed to be here tonight.</i>

42:29.330 --> 42:32.356
<i>If you're there, please pick up.</i>

42:39.206 --> 42:41.197
So we missed the boat.

42:41.408 --> 42:44.468
Oh, well, cruises are
overrated anyway.

42:45.379 --> 42:46.607
Shall we?

42:52.219 --> 42:55.017
So, what's been going on?

42:56.357 --> 42:59.724
The thing is, I'm not exactly sure
what has been going on.

43:00.895 --> 43:02.192
What do you mean?

43:04.498 --> 43:07.899
Look, Peter and I jumped
into something rather quickly.

43:08.102 --> 43:11.697
And when it wasn't working,
we both jumped out.

43:14.241 --> 43:15.640
Is it still unresolved?

43:15.843 --> 43:17.936
No, no, no. It is.

43:19.947 --> 43:24.281
The thing is, you and I have been
seeing a lot of each other.

43:24.485 --> 43:25.611
And it's been great.

43:27.021 --> 43:30.252
But it's not anything
that I was looking for.

43:30.457 --> 43:33.893
And it's caught me off balance,
rather, which I'm not used to.

43:35.362 --> 43:37.922
It makes me rather nervous.

43:41.368 --> 43:42.926
Elizabeth, I don't...

43:44.471 --> 43:46.769
I don't know what's going to happen.

43:47.808 --> 43:50.140
But I do know how I feel.

43:51.545 --> 43:53.069
And I feel like...

43:53.847 --> 43:57.442
...I've found something amazing.

43:59.453 --> 44:01.353
And I want to be here.

44:02.856 --> 44:04.721
I want to get to know you...

44:07.595 --> 44:09.529
...and not be scared.

44:14.134 --> 44:17.103
I would hate to miss another boat.
