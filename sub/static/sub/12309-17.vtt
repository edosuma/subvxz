00:01.202 --> 00:03.079
<i>Previously on Stargate Atlantis.</i>

00:03.162 --> 00:04.880
Lower your weapons.

00:04.962 --> 00:06.998
<i>We've come up with a gene therapy.</i>

00:07.082 --> 00:08.515
We think we can make it so that

00:08.602 --> 00:11.356
you will never need
to feed on humans again.

00:14.243 --> 00:15.995
How did you do that?

00:16.082 --> 00:18.756
Surely you don't think
we had anything to do with this?

00:20.163 --> 00:22.313
What the hell's going on?
Where's Caldwell?

00:22.403 --> 00:23.995
We need everyone we can.

00:24.083 --> 00:25.277
We're taking this ship back.

00:27.803 --> 00:29.680
Todd let us take her back
without so much as a fight,

00:29.763 --> 00:33.359
<i>but he's locked us out of the controls
and retreated to one of the 302 bays.</i>

00:34.404 --> 00:35.883
That's how he's going
to destroy the facility,

00:35.964 --> 00:38.114
by ramming us into it.

00:40.084 --> 00:42.518
<i>- What did you do?
- I just opened up a hyperspace window</i>

00:42.604 --> 00:46.802
big enough for the both of us.
We just traveled through the planet.

00:49.644 --> 00:51.237
How long till they get here?

00:51.325 --> 00:53.441
- Just a matter of minutes.
- Are we prepared to cloak the city?

00:53.525 --> 00:55.038
Yes, I've made
all the necessary modifications,

00:55.125 --> 00:57.480
but for the record,
I still say the shield is a better idea.

00:57.565 --> 00:58.600
Rodney.

00:58.685 --> 01:00.915
Look, that cloak offers us
no protection whatsoever.

01:01.005 --> 01:03.200
- If that hive opens up on us...
- How could they do that?

01:03.285 --> 01:04.843
They'd have to know our exact position
on the planet.

01:04.925 --> 01:05.960
Well, you're assuming they don't?

01:06.045 --> 01:08.320
Look, we've been tracking them for days!
They're headed straight for us.

01:08.405 --> 01:10.157
I think it's safe to say
they've got some inside information!

01:10.245 --> 01:12.157
Even so,
it's better not to confirm our location

01:12.246 --> 01:13.918
until we know for sure.

01:14.006 --> 01:16.474
No sense in giving them
an easy target to shoot at.

01:16.566 --> 01:18.284
Colonel Sheppard, what's your status?

01:18.366 --> 01:19.401
Standing by.

01:19.486 --> 01:21.795
<i>Be prepared to fire drones on my mark.</i>

01:21.886 --> 01:24.684
Copy that. Just say the word.

01:26.646 --> 01:30.161
Well, I suppose
we're as prepared as we can be.

01:30.246 --> 01:33.444
- Engage the cloak.
- All right.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:44.807 --> 01:47.002
Okay. Cloak's engaged.

01:47.087 --> 01:49.647
They should be here momentarily.

02:01.728 --> 02:05.118
- What's happening?
- Nothing.

02:05.208 --> 02:06.800
From what I can tell,
they're just sitting there.

02:06.888 --> 02:09.243
Do they know we're here?

02:09.328 --> 02:12.162
Hang on. I'm receiving a transmission.

02:12.249 --> 02:13.807
It's a file of some kind.

02:13.889 --> 02:16.403
- Pull it up on a firewalled computer.
- Yeah.

02:26.249 --> 02:27.238
What's it say?

02:27.329 --> 02:29.684
It's nothing. Just a random bunch of...

02:29.769 --> 02:31.601
- Wait a second.
- What is it?

02:31.690 --> 02:32.725
It's encrypted.

02:32.810 --> 02:35.404
<i>Using the same kind of algorithm
we use on the Daedalus.</i>

02:39.010 --> 02:41.478
<i>Hold your fire... Gene therapy developed</i>

02:41.570 --> 02:44.687
<i>by Dr. Keller... Some of the formulation...</i>

02:44.810 --> 02:46.641
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

02:46.730 --> 02:49.085
Looks like the file's corrupted somehow.

02:49.170 --> 02:52.049
<i>...was unable to counteract the disease.</i>

02:52.131 --> 02:54.008
<i>Help us.</i>

03:00.091 --> 03:01.888
What on Earth does that mean?

03:02.491 --> 03:04.243
I have no idea.

04:09.055 --> 04:10.773
What do you mean,
you didn't understand him?

04:10.855 --> 04:11.924
<i>The file was corrupted.</i>

04:12.015 --> 04:14.324
<i>We were only able to catch
a few words here and there.</i>

04:14.415 --> 04:18.202
<i>Though, from what we could tell,
it seemed like he was asking for our help.</i>

04:18.295 --> 04:19.488
With what?

04:19.575 --> 04:21.372
Something to do
with Jennifer's gene therapy?

04:21.454 --> 04:24.606
We already gave him a chance to test it.
He double-crossed us.

04:24.695 --> 04:26.890
I say we blow him out of the sky.

04:26.975 --> 04:29.365
I can't say I disagree with you.

04:29.456 --> 04:32.414
Though I do find it odd
he would just show up here,

04:32.496 --> 04:34.248
knowing that would likely be our reaction.

04:34.336 --> 04:37.214
And why send a file?
Why not just radio us directly?

04:37.296 --> 04:39.446
Whatever he wants,
it must be really important.

04:39.536 --> 04:41.367
Perhaps we should answer back,

04:41.456 --> 04:43.412
tell him that
we did not receive the file properly.

04:43.496 --> 04:45.214
If we do that,
we might as well just drop the cloak.

04:45.296 --> 04:46.729
They'll be able to trace our radio signal,

04:46.816 --> 04:49.377
know exactly where we are. No.

04:49.457 --> 04:50.856
We might be able
to do it from a Jumper, though.

04:50.937 --> 04:53.371
Approach the hive cloaked,
and communicate with them from there.

04:53.457 --> 04:55.687
But then they would be able to
pinpoint the Jumper's exact location.

04:55.777 --> 04:59.133
Yes, but the Jumper's a lot more
maneuverable than the city.

04:59.217 --> 05:00.332
Look, besides, this isn't the first time

05:00.417 --> 05:03.853
we've flown up to Todd's doorstep
in a Jumper.

05:04.857 --> 05:06.768
Any chance you could clean up that video,

05:06.857 --> 05:08.085
piece together more of what he's saying?

05:08.177 --> 05:11.614
No, there's too much data missing.
That is as good as we're going to get.

05:11.698 --> 05:13.689
All right. Colonel?

05:14.178 --> 05:15.497
On my way.

05:26.258 --> 05:28.454
Coming up on it now.

05:31.339 --> 05:33.773
This is Colonel John Sheppard.

05:33.859 --> 05:36.009
Please come in.

05:38.379 --> 05:41.098
We didn't receive
your video transmission correctly.

05:41.179 --> 05:43.090
Please respond.

05:43.179 --> 05:44.373
Are they getting this?

05:44.459 --> 05:46.814
They should be.
I mean, there's no reason why they...

05:47.819 --> 05:51.972
- What is it?
- I'm not picking up any life signs on board.

05:52.060 --> 05:53.254
What?

05:53.340 --> 05:54.693
I believe Rodney is correct.

05:54.780 --> 05:57.294
I have also not been able
to detect the presence of any Wraith.

05:57.380 --> 05:58.574
I thought it was because we were too far,

05:58.660 --> 06:00.776
- but this makes more sense.
- It does?

06:00.860 --> 06:03.454
This better not be a Wraith ship
from another reality.

06:03.540 --> 06:06.373
We've been tracking their approach
for a few days now, remember?

06:06.460 --> 06:09.259
<i>It didn't just pop into our space
like that other Daedalus did.</i>

06:09.341 --> 06:12.378
Look, we know that they don't show up
on our scans when they're hibernating.

06:12.461 --> 06:14.372
I think that's probably
a more logical explanation.

06:14.461 --> 06:15.814
Hibernating, all of them?

06:15.901 --> 06:17.095
Well, they could've
pre-programmed the ship

06:17.181 --> 06:20.617
to fly here on its own, enter orbit,
even send a pre-recorded signal.

06:20.701 --> 06:21.690
Why?

06:21.781 --> 06:24.170
There's only one way to find out.

06:26.341 --> 06:28.173
We're receiving a signal.

06:28.262 --> 06:29.581
It's Colonel Sheppard on a secure channel.

06:29.662 --> 06:31.493
Patch me in.

06:31.582 --> 06:32.935
Colonel, what's happening up there?

06:33.022 --> 06:35.900
Well, the Wraith have thrown us
a little curve ball here.

06:35.982 --> 06:38.052
<i>Got no life signs on board.
We think they're hibernating.</i>

06:38.142 --> 06:39.700
Why would they do that?

06:39.782 --> 06:42.216
That's what we'd like to find out,
but it means boarding the ship.

06:42.302 --> 06:44.133
Are you sure that's wise?
What if it's a trap?

06:44.222 --> 06:45.940
Well, if it is, it's a pretty lousy one.

06:46.022 --> 06:49.095
If they ambush us, you can still
take them out from down there.

06:49.183 --> 06:51.174
Sacrificing your lives.

06:51.263 --> 06:54.460
I'm flattered you think Todd would go
to so much trouble to kill me.

06:54.543 --> 06:57.740
Look, taking out a hive ship is always
a good idea, far as I'm concerned,

06:57.823 --> 06:59.859
but we did come all this way,

06:59.943 --> 07:02.776
got all dressed up.

07:02.863 --> 07:04.740
All right.

07:11.024 --> 07:12.696
No sign of them yet.

07:13.704 --> 07:15.422
Why is it that I find empty hives

07:15.504 --> 07:17.381
even creepier than the ones
that are full of Wraith?

07:17.464 --> 07:19.614
Trust me, we're better off this way.

07:19.704 --> 07:21.615
Bridge should be up here.

07:30.025 --> 07:33.301
All right, just give me a few seconds.

07:36.785 --> 07:38.377
All right.

07:40.665 --> 07:42.496
Well, I was right.

07:43.105 --> 07:45.619
- They're all in their hibernation pods.
- Where?

07:45.705 --> 07:47.901
There's several large chambers
in the aft section of the hive.

07:47.986 --> 07:50.420
The weird thing is, though,
if I'm reading this right,

07:50.506 --> 07:53.259
they haven't given themselves
a wake-up call.

07:53.346 --> 07:55.302
- What are you talking about?
- Well, the normal operating procedure

07:55.386 --> 07:57.024
would be to leave
a few crew members awake

07:57.106 --> 07:59.700
so that they could monitor the pods
and bring the others out when it's time,

07:59.786 --> 08:00.980
but since they all went in,

08:01.066 --> 08:02.499
I would assume there'd be some kind of

08:02.586 --> 08:05.817
an automatic or timed shut-down
protocol, but I can't find one.

08:05.906 --> 08:08.375
So if we do not wake them...

08:08.467 --> 08:10.423
Then they never will.

08:10.507 --> 08:12.702
Sounds good to me.

08:13.187 --> 08:15.542
Do you not find it odd
that Todd would leave himself

08:15.627 --> 08:17.743
and his entire crew to our mercy,

08:17.827 --> 08:19.704
especially after our last encounter?

08:19.787 --> 08:21.937
Maybe he's not as smart
as you think he is.

08:23.947 --> 08:25.016
What was that?

08:25.107 --> 08:26.860
Some kind of power fluctuation.

08:27.588 --> 08:31.627
I'm reading minor malfunctions
in several of the ship's systems.

08:32.388 --> 08:33.821
Hang on.

08:34.107 --> 08:35.985
I got Todd's video file.
Looks like it's intact.

08:36.068 --> 08:37.136
I thought you said it was corrupted.

08:37.227 --> 08:40.698
Well, it must've happened in transmission,
some kind of a glitch in the comm system.

08:40.788 --> 08:42.857
- The original, it's all there.
- Let's see it.

08:42.948 --> 08:44.381
All right.

08:44.468 --> 08:47.461
<i>Hold your fire. We mean you no harm.</i>

08:47.549 --> 08:51.462
<i>Allow me to explain our presence here
before you take any action.</i>

08:51.549 --> 08:56.942
<i>If you are seeing this message,
my ship has arrived safely at Atlantis.</i>

08:57.029 --> 09:02.979
<i>I'm coming to you because my crew
and I have been stricken with a disease,</i>

09:03.709 --> 09:07.180
<i>a complication to the gene therapy
developed by Dr. Keller.</i>

09:07.270 --> 09:08.464
Wait a second. We didn't give them any...

09:08.550 --> 09:10.268
<i>I acquired some of the formulation</i>

09:10.350 --> 09:13.786
<i>while my crew and I
were occupying the Daedalus.</i>

09:15.070 --> 09:20.542
<i>I admit, I wanted to see
if it would actually work.</i>

09:20.630 --> 09:22.507
<i>And it did.</i>

09:22.590 --> 09:26.425
<i>The initial results
were nothing short of astonishing.</i>

09:27.871 --> 09:30.510
<i>See for yourself.</i>

09:30.591 --> 09:34.869
<i>I was so impressed,
I decided to treat my entire crew.</i>

09:34.951 --> 09:38.580
<i>It was only then
that we began to notice problems.</i>

09:39.471 --> 09:43.384
<i>The first group grew sick and died.</i>

09:43.471 --> 09:46.270
<i>Before long,
others began to get sick, as well.</i>

09:46.352 --> 09:51.551
<i>Our natural healing ability
was unable to counteract the disease.</i>

09:51.632 --> 09:57.343
<i>I have come here
as a matter of last resort.</i>

09:57.432 --> 10:02.506
<i>I realize
we have had our differences of late,</i>

10:02.592 --> 10:06.472
<i>and you may be reluctant to help us,</i>

10:08.713 --> 10:12.023
<i>but remember this,</i>

10:12.113 --> 10:13.148
<i>if we die,</i>

10:13.233 --> 10:17.226
<i>any hope you may have
of distributing this treatment in the future</i>

10:17.313 --> 10:19.110
<i>dies with us.</i>

10:23.433 --> 10:25.469
<i>The choice is yours.</i>

10:32.154 --> 10:33.826
All right,
so now that we know what happened,

10:33.914 --> 10:38.032
we can just fire drones at them
and close the file and move on.

10:38.114 --> 10:40.230
You said his feeding hand was clean,

10:40.314 --> 10:42.748
which means the treatment worked,
at least for a while.

10:42.834 --> 10:44.392
Well, then it started killing them,

10:44.474 --> 10:46.864
so I don't know if they're going
to exactly line up for this one.

10:46.955 --> 10:50.265
Which is why we need to find out
exactly what went wrong.

10:50.355 --> 10:55.110
We need to examine every scrap
of medical data on that hive.

10:55.195 --> 10:57.550
We may even need to
revive a few of the Wraith

10:57.635 --> 11:01.514
so Dr. Keller can perform
a complete physical evaluation.

11:01.595 --> 11:03.745
I'm sorry,
but the IOA is strongly committed

11:03.835 --> 11:05.667
to the development of this gene therapy.

11:05.756 --> 11:07.428
It's one of the only things
they all agree on.

11:07.516 --> 11:09.108
If it's simply not workable, so be it,

11:09.196 --> 11:10.948
but they're going to
want to see some proof.

11:11.036 --> 11:14.631
I say it works fine. It kills Wraith.
What more do you want?

11:14.716 --> 11:16.672
You're suggesting
we keep the formula as is

11:16.756 --> 11:19.589
and find a way
of exposing them involuntarily.

11:19.676 --> 11:22.634
Why not?
Get rid of the Wraith once and for all.

11:22.716 --> 11:24.513
Don't tell me the IOA
would have a problem with that.

11:24.596 --> 11:26.155
The problem is in the delivery systems.

11:26.237 --> 11:28.705
We just went down this road
with Beckett's retrovirus.

11:28.797 --> 11:30.833
And even if we do succeed
in weaponizing the treatment,

11:30.917 --> 11:33.590
it is unlikely that we would wipe out
the Wraith entirely.

11:33.677 --> 11:36.350
At best, we would weaken them.

11:36.437 --> 11:37.552
I don't have a problem with that.

11:37.637 --> 11:40.868
On the other hand, if we do succeed
in eliminating their need to feed,

11:40.957 --> 11:43.073
we might be able to convince
their entire population

11:43.157 --> 11:44.749
to take the treatment willingly.

11:44.837 --> 11:45.987
Either way,

11:46.078 --> 11:48.990
whether it's perfecting the formula
as a treatment or a weapon,

11:49.078 --> 11:51.672
we need to gather as much information
as we possibly can,

11:51.758 --> 11:53.476
which brings me back
to the same conclusion.

11:53.558 --> 11:54.957
We need to go back up there.

11:55.038 --> 11:57.029
This time, have Dr. Keller accompany you,

11:57.118 --> 12:00.906
as well as Major Lorne's team
and another unit of marines.

12:00.998 --> 12:03.387
Are you still not sure if it's a trap?

12:03.478 --> 12:06.949
Let's just say I've learned to
exercise an abundance of caution

12:07.039 --> 12:09.189
when dealing with Todd.

12:09.279 --> 12:11.270
All right.

12:22.039 --> 12:25.430
My men have established a perimeter.
They'll be checking in every hour.

12:27.920 --> 12:29.353
Rodney?

12:29.440 --> 12:32.591
I know! I know! Power fluctuations.
Look, it's like I said,

12:32.680 --> 12:34.910
some of the ship's systems
are acting up a little.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.149
Well, get it fixed.

12:36.240 --> 12:38.196
Yeah, give me a few minutes.

13:03.401 --> 13:06.280
- Major Lorne, this is Lieutenant Williams.
- Go ahead.

13:06.362 --> 13:08.830
<i>Sir, you wanted us to
report anything unusual.</i>

13:08.922 --> 13:10.833
Yeah, that's right, Lieutenant.
What do you got?

13:10.922 --> 13:14.073
<i>Well, sir, I was standing watch,
and I heard a noise, and...</i>

13:15.562 --> 13:17.871
Well, the wall is melting.

13:18.402 --> 13:19.960
Sorry? Come again?

13:20.042 --> 13:24.001
Wait a minute. I think it stopped.
Stand by.

13:31.563 --> 13:33.360
Williams, come in.

13:33.883 --> 13:35.794
Lieutenant, please respond.

13:47.764 --> 13:49.561
How you doing?

13:50.524 --> 13:52.435
That good, huh?

13:52.524 --> 13:54.560
I don't know. I mean, I...

13:54.644 --> 13:56.714
I guess I'm making progress.

13:56.804 --> 13:58.362
I found out what was killing them.

13:58.444 --> 13:59.559
You did?

13:59.644 --> 14:01.794
The treatment worked
exactly like it was supposed to.

14:01.884 --> 14:05.082
It eliminated their feeding hands,
it activated their digestive system,

14:05.165 --> 14:06.917
just like it did in the simulation,

14:07.005 --> 14:10.361
but, unfortunately, it also created

14:10.445 --> 14:12.959
a virulent cancer-like disease
at the same time

14:13.045 --> 14:14.398
that it was weakening
their immune systems.

14:14.485 --> 14:16.362
That's what killed them.

14:16.445 --> 14:18.197
Well, is there anything
you can do about it?

14:18.285 --> 14:21.118
I don't know. Maybe. It's possible.

14:21.205 --> 14:22.354
What?

14:22.445 --> 14:25.518
I just feel like I'm in over my head.

14:25.606 --> 14:27.324
What are you talking about?

14:27.406 --> 14:30.557
I look at you and Colonel Sheppard
the rest of the team,

14:30.646 --> 14:32.796
you guys are so used to making decisions

14:32.886 --> 14:36.356
that affect the lives of thousands,
and even millions, of people.

14:36.446 --> 14:38.676
I'm not so used to
having the fate of the galaxy

14:38.766 --> 14:39.994
hang in the balance.

14:40.086 --> 14:42.759
That. You get used to it.
Helps to have a massive ego.

14:43.406 --> 14:45.875
Look, I don't know much
about Wraith physiology,

14:45.967 --> 14:47.116
but I know you.

14:47.207 --> 14:49.767
And if anyone can make this work,
you can.

14:56.407 --> 14:59.444
Well, this is his last known position.

15:00.447 --> 15:03.200
Colonel! We got something over here!

15:16.048 --> 15:17.561
Hasn't been fired.

15:17.648 --> 15:19.764
Should I call up for some more personnel
to help track him down?

15:19.848 --> 15:22.965
No, I got a better idea. Rodney?

15:23.048 --> 15:25.358
<i>Are the ship's schematics loaded
into the life-signs detector?</i>

15:25.449 --> 15:27.087
I did it when we first got here. Why?

15:27.169 --> 15:28.807
We're going to need them.

15:34.449 --> 15:35.677
Anything?

15:35.769 --> 15:37.282
No, it's just us.

15:37.369 --> 15:39.678
Ronon, Teyla, anything on your end?

15:39.769 --> 15:41.760
I'm afraid not, Colonel.

15:41.849 --> 15:44.000
<i>All right. Stay in touch.</i>

15:48.650 --> 15:50.720
What the hell is this?

15:50.810 --> 15:53.199
It's supposed to be an open corridor.

15:54.970 --> 15:57.404
- Let me see.
- Here.

15:59.770 --> 16:01.488
Rodney?

16:01.930 --> 16:04.161
This schematic you gave us
is a piece of crap.

16:04.251 --> 16:05.366
What are you talking about?

16:05.451 --> 16:07.362
<i>There's a dead end that's not on the map.</i>

16:07.451 --> 16:08.964
That's impossible!

16:09.051 --> 16:10.848
Look, I'm staring at it right now.

16:10.931 --> 16:12.125
Look, I don't know what to tell you,
all right?

16:12.211 --> 16:14.884
I pulled that schematic
directly from the ship's database.

16:14.971 --> 16:16.370
Great. We have to double back.

16:16.451 --> 16:18.567
<i>Colonel Sheppard, this is Teyla.
Please respond.</i>

16:18.651 --> 16:20.642
<i>- Go ahead.
- We found Lieutenant Williams.</i>

16:22.491 --> 16:24.323
I'm afraid he's dead.

16:27.172 --> 16:28.321
What happened?

16:28.892 --> 16:30.007
He was attacked.

16:30.092 --> 16:31.491
<i>By who?</i>

16:32.412 --> 16:36.564
I don't know, but whatever it was,
it tried to eat him.

16:37.052 --> 16:39.122
You mean feed on him?

16:39.212 --> 16:41.009
No. I mean eat him.

16:41.092 --> 16:43.209
With teeth, like an animal.

16:44.293 --> 16:45.328
What?

16:45.413 --> 16:48.723
All right, radio back,
try to get somebody to pick up the body.

16:48.813 --> 16:49.928
In the meantime, we're going to have

16:50.013 --> 16:52.049
- to figure out who the hell this is.
- Colonel.

16:56.653 --> 16:58.484
Hang on. We got something.

17:01.373 --> 17:03.410
Move back to our position.

17:27.095 --> 17:28.608
Sir,

17:28.695 --> 17:30.413
in here.

17:49.736 --> 17:52.170
Another dead end.

17:52.696 --> 17:56.245
Well, this doesn't make any sense.
The signal's right on top of us.

18:18.457 --> 18:21.530
- Is everybody okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

18:21.618 --> 18:25.816
- What the hell is that?
- A Wraith soldier without the mask.

18:26.618 --> 18:29.735
I didn't think
they ever took those things off.

18:33.178 --> 18:35.328
No feeding hand, remember?

18:35.418 --> 18:37.409
How else is he going to eat?

18:42.139 --> 18:44.733
Oh, great. So now we have to
contend with starving Wraith

18:44.819 --> 18:46.571
who are just learning to use their teeth?

18:46.659 --> 18:48.536
This is my fault.
I'm the one that took away

18:48.619 --> 18:51.372
the only practical feeding mechanism
they ever knew.

18:51.459 --> 18:54.496
All right, look,
I admit that it's a little disturbing,

18:54.579 --> 18:57.332
but it's not like
they were man's best friend before.

18:57.419 --> 18:59.091
This is just a different version
of the same thing.

18:59.179 --> 19:00.453
The question is, how did it get out?

19:00.539 --> 19:01.529
Well, the power fluctuations.

19:01.620 --> 19:03.258
They must be more widespread
than I thought.

19:03.340 --> 19:04.375
So?

19:04.460 --> 19:07.338
So, there must be a safety protocol
of some kind.

19:07.420 --> 19:09.615
When there's an interruption of the power,
the pods shut down

19:09.700 --> 19:10.849
and automatically release their occupant.

19:10.940 --> 19:13.215
But you stabilized it. Right? I mean...

19:13.300 --> 19:15.256
All the other pods are fine?

19:15.340 --> 19:18.730
They might be. I never actually figured out
what was wrong, so...

19:18.820 --> 19:21.540
Is there any way to determine if any of
the other pods have been compromised?

19:21.621 --> 19:23.418
Well, I don't know. Maybe.

19:23.501 --> 19:24.775
Why don't you go down and look?

19:24.861 --> 19:26.977
I got a better idea.
Let's get the hell out of here.

19:27.061 --> 19:29.131
Except I haven't finished
sorting through the relevant data.

19:29.221 --> 19:31.860
- I mean, the IOA...
- The IOA can sue me. Let's go.

19:42.182 --> 19:43.217
What?

19:43.302 --> 19:45.213
I know this is the way,
because we came by here this morning,

19:45.302 --> 19:46.781
but it just looks different.

19:46.862 --> 19:49.456
You're probably imagining it.

19:50.102 --> 19:51.455
Or not.

19:51.542 --> 19:52.611
McKay!

19:54.822 --> 19:57.097
Where the hell did that wall come from?
It wasn't there when we came in.

19:57.182 --> 19:58.661
- How's that possible?
- I don't know!

19:58.742 --> 20:01.211
We need to figure out
another way out of here.

20:01.783 --> 20:04.377
Okay, it looks like if we go back
the way we came a bit,

20:04.463 --> 20:06.340
we should be able to hook up
with another corridor

20:06.423 --> 20:07.697
that loops around the other side
of the Dart bay.

20:07.783 --> 20:09.933
- All right. Lead the way.
- All right.

20:16.783 --> 20:18.182
All right, this is it.

20:18.263 --> 20:20.539
Through here, about 100 meters,
and we are there.

20:33.584 --> 20:36.257
- Oh, my God.
- This is not good.

20:36.344 --> 20:37.823
You're telling me.

20:37.904 --> 20:39.383
The Dart bay's on
the other side of that thing.

20:39.464 --> 20:41.342
This is the only way out of here.

20:49.945 --> 20:53.381
Anyone want to tell me how a giant hole
magically appears in the middle of a ship?

20:53.465 --> 20:55.820
- Actually, I have a theory about that.
- You do?

20:55.905 --> 20:57.782
Look, these glitches
we've been experiencing,

20:57.865 --> 21:00.903
they're not confined to power regulation.
They're in every major system.

21:00.986 --> 21:03.261
I wouldn't call them glitches.
This is a major renovation.

21:03.346 --> 21:04.904
I know, but think about it.

21:04.986 --> 21:06.977
The Wraith ships
are basically organic, right?

21:07.066 --> 21:09.534
I mean, they're capable of
self-regeneration when they're damaged,

21:09.626 --> 21:11.105
but not just the hull.

21:11.186 --> 21:13.541
The same systems regulate
internal structure, as well,

21:13.626 --> 21:16.265
so if those systems are malfunctioning
along with the others...

21:16.346 --> 21:19.304
You think the ship
is repairing itself incorrectly?

21:19.386 --> 21:23.380
Not repairing so much as reconfiguring.

21:23.467 --> 21:26.823
Look, before he was killed,
Williams said he saw the wall melt.

21:26.907 --> 21:28.784
We've experienced it ourselves.
I mean, dead ends popping up

21:28.867 --> 21:30.016
where there're supposed to be
open corridors.

21:30.107 --> 21:34.066
And this reconfiguration has completely
cut us off from the Dart bay?

21:34.147 --> 21:36.422
- From what I can tell, yes.
- All right, get on the line to Atlantis.

21:36.507 --> 21:38.338
Tell them to send some Jumpers
and combat engineers.

21:38.427 --> 21:39.941
We need to figure out
how to get the hell outta here.

21:40.028 --> 21:41.222
Actually, I can't do that,

21:41.308 --> 21:44.186
because the communications systems
are now completely offline.

21:44.268 --> 21:46.099
- Rodney!
- Look, what do you want me to do?

21:46.188 --> 21:47.416
I mean, if I knew what was causing this,

21:47.508 --> 21:49.226
I could do something about it,
but these malfunctions

21:49.308 --> 21:52.106
are showing up everywhere.
I mean, they seem to be entirely random!

21:52.188 --> 21:56.101
- So we're stuck here?
- For the time being, yes.

21:56.188 --> 21:59.464
I do have an idea.

21:59.548 --> 22:01.380
- We revive Todd.
- What?

22:01.469 --> 22:02.982
He knows more about this ship
than anyone.

22:03.069 --> 22:04.468
Maybe he can help me
figure out what's wrong with it.

22:04.549 --> 22:06.540
You do remember the last Wraith
that came out of one of those pods

22:06.629 --> 22:07.664
ate one of our Marines?

22:07.749 --> 22:09.228
He was just a warrior drone.

22:09.309 --> 22:11.539
Look, we've long suspected
that they spend the majority of their life

22:11.629 --> 22:14.223
under the controlling mental influence
of the other Wraith.

22:14.309 --> 22:15.981
It's not surprising that
if you remove that influence,

22:16.069 --> 22:17.821
they revert to an animal state.

22:17.909 --> 22:19.946
But that shouldn't happen
with Todd, theoretically.

22:20.030 --> 22:22.339
Yeah, but you're forgetting one thing.
I haven't found a cure

22:22.430 --> 22:23.545
for the disease that was killing them.

22:23.630 --> 22:26.940
I mean, we take him out,
and he might not last long.

22:27.030 --> 22:29.225
Well, that's the one thing
I like about the plan.

22:30.190 --> 22:32.146
Oh, great!

22:32.230 --> 22:33.549
Okay, so navigation's acting up.

22:33.630 --> 22:35.222
Look, whatever we decide,
we got to do it quickly,

22:35.310 --> 22:39.223
because I cannot stay ahead
of these malfunctions for much longer.

22:43.111 --> 22:45.227
You sure about this?

23:09.672 --> 23:12.789
- Sheppard.
- How are you feeling?

23:12.872 --> 23:15.181
I did not think you would come.

23:15.312 --> 23:16.870
What are friends for?

23:17.432 --> 23:19.424
Your ship is malfunctioning.

23:19.513 --> 23:21.151
We need you to fix it.

23:21.233 --> 23:22.985
You woke me for this?

23:23.073 --> 23:26.349
That's right. You've got work to do.

23:30.833 --> 23:33.666
You know, I tried that already.

23:33.753 --> 23:37.223
Okay, all right. You know what?
You just go ahead.

23:37.633 --> 23:39.943
Somebody woke up
on the wrong side of the pod this morning.

23:40.034 --> 23:43.583
This makes no sense.
These systems are behaving erratically.

23:43.674 --> 23:44.868
That's what I've been trying to tell you!

23:44.954 --> 23:46.785
- What have you done to them?
- I haven't done anything!

23:46.874 --> 23:49.866
They've been acting screwy
since the moment we came on board!

23:49.954 --> 23:52.422
Nothing's responding the way it should.

23:52.514 --> 23:54.869
It's almost as if...

23:54.954 --> 23:56.182
What?

23:56.274 --> 23:59.108
No, it's not possible.

23:59.195 --> 24:00.389
What's not possible?

24:00.475 --> 24:03.547
I believe I know why
the ship is malfunctioning.

24:06.915 --> 24:08.746
The disease is in the ship?

24:08.835 --> 24:11.303
It is the only explanation
that makes sense.

24:11.395 --> 24:13.033
All right, if you say so.

24:13.115 --> 24:14.548
How is that even possible?

24:14.635 --> 24:16.944
During the process of hibernation,

24:17.035 --> 24:21.268
there is a continuous exchange
of fluid between Wraith and hive.

24:21.356 --> 24:23.506
The disease must have been transmitted
in this manner.

24:23.596 --> 24:26.633
Great. So we're flying around
in a giant tumor.

24:26.716 --> 24:28.593
With no way off.

24:28.676 --> 24:32.305
As time goes on
and the disease progresses,

24:32.396 --> 24:34.864
more and more systems
will become affected.

24:34.956 --> 24:37.789
Inertial dampeners, life support,
hull integrity...

24:37.876 --> 24:39.196
Can we land it?

24:40.517 --> 24:44.795
Landing a hive is a tricky proposition
in the best of circumstances.

24:44.877 --> 24:47.550
Under these conditions,
I would not recommend it.

24:47.637 --> 24:49.275
So, what do we do?

24:49.357 --> 24:51.951
There is only one thing we can do.

24:52.037 --> 24:54.392
- We must cure this disease.
- Wait a second.

24:54.477 --> 24:56.786
I've barely scratched the surface
on what went wrong here.

24:56.877 --> 24:58.869
I mean, it could take months
to analyze the data.

24:58.958 --> 25:01.392
At the current level
of the ship's degradation,

25:01.478 --> 25:04.390
I estimate we have four days
before it becomes uninhabitable.

25:04.478 --> 25:06.355
Well, you better get to work.

25:12.878 --> 25:14.231
How's it going, Rodney?

25:14.318 --> 25:15.307
Well, aside from the fact

25:15.398 --> 25:17.913
that every time I try to fix something,
something else breaks, fine.

25:17.999 --> 25:20.229
So we can expect
more of these power fluctuations?

25:20.319 --> 25:22.230
I think it's more than likely.
Probably going to get worse.

25:22.319 --> 25:23.638
Then we've got a problem.

25:23.719 --> 25:24.708
The other Wraith.

25:24.799 --> 25:26.710
We can't afford
to let them get out anymore.

25:26.799 --> 25:30.109
I have been able to identify
that safety protocol I was talking about.

25:30.199 --> 25:31.234
I won't be able to override it completely,

25:31.319 --> 25:33.469
but I should be able to
make a few key alterations.

25:33.559 --> 25:34.594
Yeah? Like what?

25:34.679 --> 25:36.510
Well, I mean, the simplest thing to do
would be to make it

25:36.599 --> 25:39.160
so that the pods don't release the Wraith
when they shut down,

25:39.240 --> 25:42.516
but that would kill them.
Basically suffocate them.

25:42.600 --> 25:44.909
- Great. They're Wraith.
- Yeah, but are they?

25:45.000 --> 25:46.718
I mean, they've taken the treatment.
They no longer feed.

25:46.800 --> 25:49.360
- Tell that to Lieutenant Williams.
- What about Todd?

25:49.440 --> 25:51.032
If significant numbers
of his crew are killed,

25:51.120 --> 25:52.348
he will demand to know why.

25:52.440 --> 25:54.271
Just another malfunction.

25:54.360 --> 25:56.191
Do it.

25:56.280 --> 25:57.634
All right.

26:03.961 --> 26:05.679
You all right?

26:05.761 --> 26:07.797
It will pass.

26:08.321 --> 26:09.913
I'm sorry.

26:10.001 --> 26:11.992
I never meant for any of this to happen.

26:12.081 --> 26:16.393
I honestly thought the treatment
would make things better for everyone.

26:19.602 --> 26:21.672
What's funny?

26:22.322 --> 26:27.077
I find it amusing,
human apologizing to Wraith.

26:27.802 --> 26:29.520
That's 'cause
you don't understand compassion.

26:29.602 --> 26:32.435
You just view it as a sign of weakness.

26:32.522 --> 26:34.433
Isn't it?

26:34.522 --> 26:37.356
No, not by a long shot.

26:37.443 --> 26:41.152
I'm not sure Colonel Sheppard
would agree with you.

26:41.243 --> 26:43.598
Colonel Sheppard's a soldier. I'm a doctor.

26:43.683 --> 26:45.241
Yes.

26:45.323 --> 26:48.440
His job is to take lives
and yours is to save them.

26:48.523 --> 26:51.674
No, his job is also to save lives.

26:52.283 --> 26:55.002
He just has a different set of tools.

27:02.204 --> 27:07.039
All right. I've created a program
to override the safety protocol.

27:07.124 --> 27:09.843
- You sure you want me to do this?
- Go ahead.

27:09.924 --> 27:11.073
All right.

27:19.525 --> 27:21.720
- What is that?
- It's one of the hibernation chambers.

27:21.805 --> 27:24.114
It's not accepting the new commands.

27:24.725 --> 27:27.717
No, it's no good.
I can't access it from here.

27:27.805 --> 27:29.284
How many of them are in there?

27:29.365 --> 27:30.957
Well, it's one of
the smaller auxiliary chambers,

27:31.045 --> 27:34.276
so a couple of dozen at the most.

27:34.365 --> 27:38.359
All right, we're going to have to figure out
another way to deal with these guys.

27:50.846 --> 27:52.404
Colonel.

28:01.127 --> 28:04.836
Well, that's not a good sign. Let's move.

28:06.887 --> 28:08.878
Power fluctuations.

28:08.967 --> 28:11.083
More of them could be out.

28:14.327 --> 28:18.082
This is what I was afraid of.

28:18.168 --> 28:19.726
McKay. We just figured out

28:19.808 --> 28:22.003
<i>why you weren't able to
access the last chamber.</i>

28:22.088 --> 28:24.204
What? What is it?

28:24.288 --> 28:26.643
We're too late. The pods are opened.

28:26.728 --> 28:27.877
How many got out?

28:31.088 --> 28:32.680
All of them.

28:34.968 --> 28:36.243
All right, we're going to split into teams.

28:36.329 --> 28:38.604
We're going to divide each deck
into four sections.

28:38.689 --> 28:40.839
We're going to sweep through,
starting from this position.

28:40.929 --> 28:42.282
Don't take any chances.

28:42.369 --> 28:45.486
Shoot anything that moves.
Everyone clear?

28:45.569 --> 28:47.321
All right, let's move out.

29:21.411 --> 29:22.526
It says here

29:22.611 --> 29:28.561
you attempted to use iratus DNA
in your treatment.

29:28.651 --> 29:31.563
Yeah, I thought using the pure DNA
of an iratus bug

29:31.651 --> 29:35.246
would help prevent the deterioration
of your Wraith abilities.

29:35.331 --> 29:37.971
Got the idea from Michael,
if you can believe that,

29:38.052 --> 29:41.089
but, unfortunately, it didn't work, so...

29:42.412 --> 29:43.970
What is it?

29:44.052 --> 29:46.122
I have an idea.

29:47.412 --> 29:50.051
<i>- Colonel Sheppard, come in, please.
- This is Sheppard.</i>

29:50.132 --> 29:51.724
We need you to come down
to the lab right away.

29:51.812 --> 29:53.165
Todd needs to speak to you.

29:53.252 --> 29:56.131
<i>I'm a little busy right now. Can it wait?</i>

29:56.213 --> 29:57.566
Apparently not.

29:58.613 --> 30:01.491
Meet up with Teyla and Ramirez
till I get back.

30:04.493 --> 30:06.051
What's so damn important?

30:06.133 --> 30:07.486
He says there's a way to fix this.

30:07.573 --> 30:09.564
Fix what? Cure the disease?

30:09.653 --> 30:12.770
Not cure it, but undo it.

30:12.853 --> 30:14.445
What are you talking about?

30:14.533 --> 30:17.094
As you know,
healthy Wraith have an inherent ability

30:17.174 --> 30:20.450
to heal themselves of almost any ailment,

30:20.534 --> 30:21.967
but this has not always been the case.

30:22.054 --> 30:26.491
Hundreds of thousands of years ago,
there was a treatment of last resort.

30:26.574 --> 30:28.610
All right, all right,
spare me the history lessons.

30:28.694 --> 30:33.563
A terminally ill Wraith could occasionally
restore himself to perfect health

30:33.654 --> 30:37.364
if he allowed an iratus "bug,"
as you call them,

30:37.455 --> 30:40.686
specifically a queen, to feed on him.

30:40.775 --> 30:42.447
And you're just bringing this up now?

30:42.535 --> 30:45.811
The process was abandoned long ago
because it is dangerous,

30:45.895 --> 30:50.411
almost always resulting
in the death of the Wraith in question.

30:51.015 --> 30:53.734
I only consider it now

30:53.815 --> 30:57.286
because it would appear that we are

30:57.376 --> 31:00.493
beyond hope.

31:01.376 --> 31:05.085
Now, there is a planet
less than three days' journey

31:05.176 --> 31:06.734
where we will find what we need.

31:06.816 --> 31:08.693
McKay can barely keep this thing in orbit,

31:08.776 --> 31:10.289
and you want to take it into hyperspace?

31:10.376 --> 31:11.650
I can manage it.

31:11.736 --> 31:13.215
Well, forget about it.

31:13.296 --> 31:14.615
We're going to come up
with a solution right here.

31:14.697 --> 31:16.369
This is the only way to save my crew.

31:16.457 --> 31:18.095
Well, we're not leaving.

31:18.977 --> 31:22.128
At least do me the courtesy
of being honest.

31:25.337 --> 31:27.009
This is not about you

31:27.097 --> 31:32.046
not wanting to risk a jump to hyperspace
on a damaged ship.

31:32.137 --> 31:35.050
You do not want me to go
because I'll be restoring the lives

31:35.138 --> 31:37.652
of hundreds of unhealthy Wraith,
including myself.

31:37.738 --> 31:40.013
I got to admit, that did cross my mind.

31:40.098 --> 31:42.737
This disease is your responsibility.

31:43.418 --> 31:49.254
If I had not agreed to meet with you
to discuss this innovation of yours,

31:49.338 --> 31:53.092
my crew and I would not be
in this predicament!

31:53.178 --> 31:55.773
Well, I might be feeling
a little more charitable

31:55.859 --> 32:00.808
if you hadn't tried to kill half my people
last time we decided to trust each other!

32:14.620 --> 32:18.738
You owe me this, Sheppard.

32:19.860 --> 32:22.249
I don't owe you anything.

32:22.940 --> 32:25.090
Get him out of here.

32:34.541 --> 32:37.658
Well, I guess I can't count
on his help anymore.

32:39.661 --> 32:41.014
What was that?

32:41.101 --> 32:43.217
<i>Sheppard, you're going to want
to get up here.</i>

32:43.301 --> 32:45.212
Keep working.

32:52.381 --> 32:53.815
What the hell was that?

32:53.902 --> 32:54.937
It looks like Todd's estimate

32:55.022 --> 32:56.899
of how long the ship's going to last
is a little off.

32:56.982 --> 32:58.938
- What are you talking about?
- You remember that hole we saw?

32:59.022 --> 33:01.172
It's getting bigger, and it's beginning
to threaten the hull integrity,

33:01.262 --> 33:03.253
but that's not the biggest problem.

33:03.342 --> 33:04.536
See that?

33:04.622 --> 33:07.659
That is a line of structural weakness
right across the width of the hive.

33:07.742 --> 33:10.859
If there's an explosive decompression,
this entire thing could be ripped in half.

33:10.942 --> 33:13.776
This is Sheppard. All teams fall back.
Fall back immediately.

33:15.303 --> 33:17.100
We're not finished
dealing with the Wraith yet.

33:17.183 --> 33:19.777
Just leave them. The hull's failing.
Get the hell out of there.

33:19.863 --> 33:21.581
You heard the man. Let's move!

33:21.663 --> 33:22.982
Let's go! Let's go!

33:23.823 --> 33:25.256
Come on! Hurry up!

33:39.624 --> 33:41.455
Are you all right?

33:41.544 --> 33:43.262
Yeah.

33:47.144 --> 33:49.214
Let's get the hell out of here.

33:56.745 --> 33:58.463
What is it?

33:58.545 --> 34:00.740
The door's jammed. Won't open.

34:00.825 --> 34:01.860
Rodney, this is Teyla.

34:01.945 --> 34:04.095
We are stuck behind a door
that will not open. Can you help us?

34:04.185 --> 34:06.938
Look, the controls are malfunctioning.
I can't seem to override them.

34:07.025 --> 34:09.539
Just give me a minute.

34:09.625 --> 34:12.344
We might not have a minute, Rodney.

34:26.585 --> 34:27.780
Crap.

34:35.947 --> 34:40.099
Guys? You need to get out of there now.
You hear me? Get out of there now!

34:52.547 --> 34:54.583
Go, go, go!

34:54.668 --> 34:55.783
Go!

35:15.589 --> 35:17.386
Sheppard! Come in, please!

35:18.789 --> 35:20.905
- Yeah, we're here.
- Oh, thank God.

35:20.989 --> 35:23.139
- I take it the bulkhead held?
- Yeah, for now.

35:23.229 --> 35:25.220
<i>Look, I was able to seal off the section
so it won't depressurize,</i>

35:25.309 --> 35:26.867
but you need to get down here...

35:28.349 --> 35:31.022
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

35:31.789 --> 35:32.905
What now?

35:32.990 --> 35:35.265
The force of the ship tearing itself apart,
it's shifted our trajectory.

35:35.350 --> 35:37.068
We're headed straight for the planet!

35:48.590 --> 35:49.739
What's our status, Rodney?

35:49.830 --> 35:52.219
I would say screwed is an apt description.

35:52.311 --> 35:54.541
- Are we going to burn up?
- No, we're going to survive re-entry.

35:54.631 --> 35:57.225
In fact, it'll even slow us down a little,
but nowhere near enough.

35:57.311 --> 35:58.300
Can you get us over the water?

35:58.391 --> 36:00.302
Land, water, at the speed we're traveling,
it's not gonna matter.

36:00.391 --> 36:01.426
We'll be vaporized on impact.

36:01.511 --> 36:03.024
- We've got to do something.
- Like what?

36:03.111 --> 36:05.784
- Think!
- I don't know... Okay, right.

36:05.871 --> 36:07.623
Forward maneuvering thrusters.
They should be unaffected.

36:07.711 --> 36:09.030
But they're not getting any power

36:09.111 --> 36:11.102
because the propulsion conduits
have been ripped in half.

36:11.191 --> 36:12.910
All right, look.
I may be able to reroute power to them

36:12.992 --> 36:14.345
so they can slow our descent.

36:14.432 --> 36:15.421
All right, now you're talking.

36:15.512 --> 36:17.184
The only problem is,
I haven't a clue how to do it!

36:17.272 --> 36:18.910
Look, even if the systems
weren't all malfunctioning,

36:18.992 --> 36:21.142
it would still take me a few hours
to create that kind of work-around.

36:21.232 --> 36:23.029
All right, just keep working on it.

36:23.112 --> 36:26.024
- Where the hell are you going?
- I'm going to go get some help.

36:29.832 --> 36:32.028
- Get up.
- You can't quite leave me be.

36:32.113 --> 36:33.546
I don't have time to play games.

36:33.633 --> 36:34.907
You know what that shaking is.

36:34.993 --> 36:37.188
I can guess.

36:37.273 --> 36:39.628
We've lost orbit.
We're entering the atmosphere,

36:39.713 --> 36:42.181
which means in a few minutes,
we're going to slam into that planet.

36:42.273 --> 36:44.833
A quick death will be a welcome reprieve.

36:44.913 --> 36:47.825
I didn't think you were such a quitter.

36:47.913 --> 36:51.110
Look, you get this ship on the ground,
I'll take you to your bug planet.

36:51.193 --> 36:53.913
And you expect me to believe that?

36:53.994 --> 36:55.712
My word.

36:58.994 --> 37:01.713
And my crew?

37:01.794 --> 37:03.466
They're dead.

37:04.994 --> 37:07.110
The ship sheared in two.
We lost the entire rear section.

37:07.194 --> 37:09.469
If we'd gone to the planet
when I suggested it,

37:09.554 --> 37:10.669
none of this would have happened!

37:10.754 --> 37:12.586
We would have never made it there,
and you know it.

37:12.675 --> 37:14.506
The hull was too badly damaged.

37:14.595 --> 37:18.713
Now, I understand you're pissed off
about your crew,

37:18.795 --> 37:19.910
but we're about to join them

37:19.995 --> 37:21.713
unless somebody manages
to slow us down.

37:21.795 --> 37:23.513
So are you going to help us out?

37:26.955 --> 37:30.914
We're in the atmosphere.
Altitude 100,000 feet.

37:30.995 --> 37:32.588
It is no use. I cannot control it.

37:32.676 --> 37:34.189
Move aside!

37:37.476 --> 37:40.309
- You sure about this?
- What can he do? We're in a free fall.

37:40.396 --> 37:42.671
I believe I can successfully create a bypass

37:42.756 --> 37:44.474
that will deliver power
to the forward thrusters,

37:44.556 --> 37:45.875
but it will take a few moments.

37:45.956 --> 37:48.868
- Hey, you just take your time.
- Impact in 15 seconds.

37:48.956 --> 37:51.835
Not if I can help it. Firing thrusters!

38:00.797 --> 38:03.391
-40,000 feet. Still descending too fast.
- It's not enough!

38:03.477 --> 38:04.626
Instead of criticizing,

38:04.717 --> 38:07.185
perhaps you could work
at getting me some more power!

38:07.277 --> 38:08.756
I'm on it!

38:08.837 --> 38:10.589
20,000 feet, still too fast.

38:10.677 --> 38:12.236
Angle the thrusters.
Try to get the ship level.

38:12.318 --> 38:14.309
We can glide her across the water.

38:14.398 --> 38:17.151
Trust me. I've done this before.

38:17.238 --> 38:18.273
10,000 feet.

38:18.358 --> 38:20.792
That's it. That's all the power we've got.

38:33.439 --> 38:35.475
2,000 feet!

38:35.839 --> 38:38.592
This is it! We're about to
lose the inertial dampeners!

39:06.560 --> 39:09.358
They just hit the water.
I've got the coordinates.

39:09.440 --> 39:12.274
Relay them
to the rescue Jumpers immediately.

39:22.201 --> 39:24.715
Colonel. Good to see you
back on your feet.

39:24.801 --> 39:27.520
- How's the rest of your team?
- You know, recovering.

39:27.601 --> 39:29.592
We took quite a jolt
when we hit the water.

39:29.681 --> 39:32.560
I can imagine. You were lucky.

39:32.642 --> 39:34.075
By the time Major Kersey and his team

39:34.162 --> 39:36.278
were able to blast their way
down to your position,

39:36.362 --> 39:38.922
the hive, what remained of it,
was already half full of water.

39:39.002 --> 39:41.596
It sank minutes after they extracted you.

39:41.682 --> 39:43.912
Wish I was awake to see that.

39:46.562 --> 39:48.518
- How is he?
- Not well.

39:48.602 --> 39:50.958
He hasn't responded to any treatment.

39:53.523 --> 39:55.832
I received your request.

39:56.643 --> 40:00.192
- And?
- Forgive me if I'm wrong,

40:00.283 --> 40:02.160
but weren't you the one
who wanted to destroy his ship

40:02.243 --> 40:04.632
when it first appeared?

40:04.723 --> 40:05.951
Sounds vaguely familiar.

40:06.043 --> 40:09.035
And now you want me
to go against protocol and let him go.

40:09.123 --> 40:11.797
- Well, he is the reason we're alive.
- I realize that, Colonel.

40:11.884 --> 40:14.398
He's also the reason
you were in danger in the first place,

40:14.484 --> 40:16.634
not to mention an incredible security risk.

40:16.724 --> 40:19.682
All right, look,
he's probably going to die anyway.

40:19.764 --> 40:20.799
And if he survives?

40:20.884 --> 40:23.318
If he survives,
he's going to remember what we did.

40:23.404 --> 40:26.680
Like it or not, he's the best ally
we've had in the fight against the Wraith.

40:26.764 --> 40:29.996
If we ever get around
to perfecting this gene therapy,

40:30.085 --> 40:32.155
we're going to need his help to deploy it.

40:33.605 --> 40:37.120
You realize this is the kind of decision
that could cost me my job.

40:38.405 --> 40:40.043
Aren't they all?

40:52.006 --> 40:55.681
I appreciate your decision to let me go.

40:57.126 --> 40:59.435
A deal's a deal.

40:59.526 --> 41:02.677
I will remember this, John Sheppard.

41:03.305 --> 41:09.552
