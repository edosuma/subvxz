WEBVTT

00:23.106 --> 00:27.653
You know, I've realized
lately that... I'm alone.

00:42.584 --> 00:44.461
I look around,

00:47.256 --> 00:49.049
all I want is...

00:50.342 --> 00:51.927
Just to be...

00:52.010 --> 00:55.222
all I want is
to talk to a girl.

00:55.305 --> 00:58.058
And hopefully that
can lead somewhere, like...

01:00.769 --> 01:01.854
A relationship?

01:03.146 --> 01:04.397
Some love,

01:04.480 --> 01:06.149
some affection, you know?

01:06.400 --> 01:07.901
Things that everybody wants.

01:14.950 --> 01:16.952
And yet...

01:17.035 --> 01:18.704
here I sit...

01:18.787 --> 01:19.997
all by myself.

01:27.296 --> 01:28.672
I just, I...

01:37.598 --> 01:39.474
I don't understand what it is.

01:39.558 --> 01:43.145
I see all you beautiful
women walking around

01:43.228 --> 01:45.272
with boyfriends,
holding peoples' hands.

01:47.691 --> 01:49.651
That's what I want, right.

01:49.735 --> 01:52.946
I feel that I am worthy
of somebody else's love

01:53.030 --> 01:54.698
and affection.

01:54.781 --> 02:00.996
And yet, what I really feel like
lately is that every--

02:01.079 --> 02:05.125
All you girls,
and all you women are just...

02:05.209 --> 02:07.044
repulsed by me.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.127
And...

02:08.878 --> 02:11.924
And I don't know why that is.

02:12.007 --> 02:13.467
Right? Like...

02:15.719 --> 02:16.720
I'm...

02:18.514 --> 02:20.724
I'm pretty, like--

02:20.807 --> 02:22.518
I make myself attractive.

02:22.601 --> 02:24.019
I go to the gym.

02:24.102 --> 02:26.939
I take care of my place.

02:27.022 --> 02:29.024
You know, I'm not--I--

02:29.107 --> 02:32.861
I'm doing everything in my power
to get you to notice me,

02:32.945 --> 02:34.905
and yet, every time I walk out,

02:34.988 --> 02:36.365
I feel like I'm walking around

02:36.448 --> 02:38.992
and I'm playing the part
of the invisible man

02:39.076 --> 02:42.079
every day of my life because
nobody fucking notices me.

02:57.469 --> 02:58.762
I know I'm worthy.

02:58.846 --> 03:03.517
I know I'm worthy
of girls' love and affection.

03:06.728 --> 03:08.313
And yet, I...

03:09.565 --> 03:12.401
Somebody made a law
and said I can't have that.

03:14.278 --> 03:15.946
So, I'm 28.

03:20.784 --> 03:22.244
And I'm a virgin.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.937

05:47.139 --> 05:49.183
[woman] You don't want
me to be lonely, do you?

05:56.815 --> 05:58.400
Is anyone online?

06:12.456 --> 06:14.833
As you can see,
I'm already all ready for bed.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.333
Keep a girl company.

07:22.693 --> 07:26.196
I'm going to be up all night.

07:50.429 --> 07:52.264
Do you want
to go chat in private?

07:58.729 --> 08:00.272
[indistinct]

08:03.984 --> 08:06.528
I'm feeling a bit
lonely tonight, guys.

08:06.612 --> 08:08.363
Somebody come keep me company.

08:16.246 --> 08:18.749
Somebody with a sexy voice

08:18.832 --> 08:20.584
who can make me smile.

08:22.503 --> 08:24.046
You know who I'm talking about.

09:26.483 --> 09:28.026
[washing machine running]

09:33.115 --> 09:34.658
Thank you.

[slow music]

11:37.698 --> 11:39.491
-Hi.
-Thank god.

11:40.868 --> 11:42.494
Are you okay?

11:42.661 --> 11:44.580
What do you mean am I okay?

11:44.663 --> 11:46.206
I saw that video you made.

11:46.665 --> 11:47.875
What video?

11:47.958 --> 11:51.044
Your sister sent it
to me and I just watched it.

11:51.128 --> 11:52.963
You weren't
supposed to see that.

11:54.423 --> 11:57.259
You just seemed so lonely.

11:58.427 --> 12:00.721
I was very worried about you.

12:00.804 --> 12:03.390
Are you alright?
What's going on there?

12:03.557 --> 12:06.018
-What are you--
-What's happening?

12:06.101 --> 12:07.603
You weren't--

12:07.686 --> 12:09.771
You weren't supposed
to see that, okay?

12:09.855 --> 12:11.857
It left me
with a very bad feeling.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.901
-You sound nervous.
-I thought you were happy.

12:13.984 --> 12:15.194
I know.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.654
I'm fine.

12:18.864 --> 12:20.866
You don't. You're not alone.
If you have a problem,

12:20.949 --> 12:22.034
you can call me.

12:22.117 --> 12:24.036
We'll talk about it,
and you can always come home.

12:24.703 --> 12:26.830
Don't do anything.

12:28.790 --> 12:30.834
Like, I don't--

12:30.918 --> 12:32.336
I don't want to talk about this.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.046
I don't want to talk
about this right now.

12:34.129 --> 12:36.215
-You can talk to me.
-No, because it's not--

12:37.382 --> 12:38.926
I'm fine.

12:39.009 --> 12:41.970
For every problem
you have there's a solution.

12:42.054 --> 12:43.764
-[woman on computer] Hey, guys.
-[music]

12:44.765 --> 12:46.308
I'm back. Did you miss me?

12:48.685 --> 12:50.354
[mother] What's going
on in your life?

12:51.939 --> 12:54.525
-I have to go now, okay?
-I'm very worried about you.

12:54.608 --> 12:56.026
I don't want you to worry.

12:56.109 --> 12:59.154
There's this girl
coming by who I like.

12:59.238 --> 13:02.199
And, yeah, I really got to go.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.784
I got to go.

13:03.867 --> 13:05.410
-We love you.
-Okay, bye.

13:05.702 --> 13:07.538
[woman on computer]
That's sweet and kind of you.

13:09.706 --> 13:11.500
What, not these clothes?

13:12.501 --> 13:14.044
You want these clothes off?

13:21.051 --> 13:22.052
Yeah?

13:26.473 --> 13:28.684
You can see
a little more if, uh...

13:29.685 --> 13:31.103
We kick it, just me and you.

13:35.065 --> 13:36.525
So impatient.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.827
How patient am I?

13:47.327 --> 13:48.829
I'm not that patient.

13:51.248 --> 13:52.666
Come on. Somebody come play.

13:58.547 --> 14:00.007
[giggles]

14:03.886 --> 14:05.345
That's always nice to hear.

14:11.393 --> 14:12.394
Okay.

14:13.437 --> 14:15.731
I need to remove
somebody from this room,

14:15.814 --> 14:17.983
because he's not
being very nice.

14:21.278 --> 14:22.279
Bye.

14:22.738 --> 14:26.742
Sorry, guys. There's always
some weirdo that comes on here.

14:26.825 --> 14:28.827
I'm glad the rest
of you are still with me.

14:31.580 --> 14:33.373
Come on. You're not going
to make a girl wait all night,

14:33.457 --> 14:34.499
are you?

14:43.967 --> 14:45.636
That was very generous.

14:46.512 --> 14:48.514
Thank you, Mr. Darcy.

14:52.809 --> 14:54.144
[giggles]

14:55.312 --> 14:59.525
I don't know if snuggling
the cam works quite so well.

15:01.193 --> 15:02.778
I just turn into a blob.

15:02.986 --> 15:04.279
[giggles]

15:09.660 --> 15:11.370
Come on. I thought
you were gentlemen.

15:13.789 --> 15:16.542
Gentlemen don't keep
a lady waiting all night.

15:19.127 --> 15:21.463
These clothes are getting
so uncomfortable.

15:28.720 --> 15:33.475
Hey, guys. I'm going to
run outside for a few minutes

15:33.559 --> 15:35.936
for my dirty bad girl habit.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.105
I'll be back soon.

16:51.345 --> 16:53.222
Let me guess. You want
to bum a cigarette?

16:54.306 --> 16:56.767
Uh, sure. Yeah.

16:58.894 --> 17:00.395
If you don't mind, yeah, sure.

17:07.528 --> 17:08.987
-I'm Jared--
-[clears throat]

17:09.070 --> 17:10.489
I'm Jared by the way.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.622
Do you have a lighter?

17:19.122 --> 17:22.084
Sorry, I just--
All I have is my--

17:39.434 --> 17:40.894
So we meet again.

17:41.603 --> 17:43.730
Because I saw you
in the laundry room before.

17:45.357 --> 17:47.484
Sorry about that by the way.

17:48.569 --> 17:51.738
I don't mean to, you know,
weird you out or anything.

18:03.041 --> 18:04.626
So what are you up to tonight?

18:06.420 --> 18:09.256
I'm heading in
as soon as this is done.

18:11.758 --> 18:12.759
Cool.

18:20.434 --> 18:22.227
How long have you, uh...

18:22.311 --> 18:24.104
I mean, I'm assuming
you live in the building.

18:24.188 --> 18:26.023
Yeah, I live in the building.

18:26.106 --> 18:28.775
Um, six months.

18:31.612 --> 18:33.906
-I've been here six years.
-Mm.

18:37.576 --> 18:38.577
So...

18:39.494 --> 18:42.122
I don't know. It's been alright.

18:50.005 --> 18:51.590
What are you, uh--

18:53.967 --> 18:56.512
doing these days?

18:58.805 --> 18:59.806
Um.

19:00.724 --> 19:05.395
I have to head in, but it
was nice chatting with you.

19:06.563 --> 19:07.940
Yeah, likewise.

19:09.691 --> 19:11.443
Thanks for the cigarette again.

19:12.986 --> 19:14.279
See you.

19:26.750 --> 19:31.630
I have a private request,
so I'll be back.

19:35.759 --> 19:37.427
[tense music]

19:38.387 --> 19:39.847
Hello, Mr. Darcy.

19:45.769 --> 19:47.187
Are you there?

19:48.647 --> 19:49.648
Hi.

19:50.190 --> 19:51.191
Hi.

19:52.693 --> 19:54.695
I haven't met
you before have I?

19:58.115 --> 20:01.034
What would you
like me to do for you?

20:03.745 --> 20:06.623
I could take this tank
top off for you.

20:07.708 --> 20:09.501
Is it okay if we just talk?

20:09.960 --> 20:11.378
Is this your first time?

20:14.715 --> 20:16.341
What do you want to talk about?

20:17.092 --> 20:18.552
So what should I call you?

20:20.512 --> 20:22.264
You can call me Ivy.

20:25.142 --> 20:26.852
Why don't you tell
me about yourself?

20:28.061 --> 20:29.438
What do you look like?

20:31.398 --> 20:33.275
-Normal]

20:34.109 --> 20:37.029

What color are your eyes?

20:38.030 --> 20:39.031
Green.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.533
I love green eyes.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.543
How long have you
been doing this?

20:52.628 --> 20:53.795
Not long.

20:59.176 --> 21:00.719
I think you're really beautiful.

21:02.221 --> 21:03.472
Thank you.

21:04.473 --> 21:06.183
I like the way you smile.

21:13.315 --> 21:15.150
-Can you bring it in anymore?
-Mm-hm.

21:20.656 --> 21:21.657
Yeah.

21:22.199 --> 21:24.618
Are you touching
yourself right now, Mr. Darcy?

21:25.744 --> 21:27.454
It would turn me on if you were.

21:28.705 --> 21:30.040
I just want to talk.

21:34.503 --> 21:36.463
I wish you could keep smiling.

21:37.881 --> 21:38.882
Yeah?

21:47.266 --> 21:48.851
What do you look for in a guy?

21:48.934 --> 21:50.310
[laughs]

21:51.645 --> 21:54.064
I like someone
who makes me laugh.

21:55.023 --> 21:57.234
And someone
who knows how to touch me.

22:01.154 --> 22:02.698
I want to touch you.

22:05.242 --> 22:08.412
I think my body would
like to be caressed right now.

22:11.623 --> 22:13.542
Are you touching
yourself right now?

22:14.126 --> 22:15.627
Want me to play, too?

22:21.341 --> 22:22.843
Can I show you

22:23.886 --> 22:25.137
a bit more?

22:31.226 --> 22:32.227
Yeah?

22:33.562 --> 22:34.563
[unzips]

22:39.818 --> 22:41.445
Should I take this off?

22:49.912 --> 22:51.872
Where is your hand right now?

22:58.170 --> 22:59.171
Oops.

23:01.089 --> 23:02.508
Shouldn't have done that.

23:05.719 --> 23:07.804
Let's see. How much
more should I show you?

23:12.976 --> 23:14.937
I just want to make you happy.

23:15.521 --> 23:17.022
Can we stop talking?

23:17.105 --> 23:18.440
[giggles]

23:19.274 --> 23:20.984
Maybe a little more?

26:16.952 --> 26:18.829
Have a you seen a sock?
It's got, like,

26:19.288 --> 26:21.415
half a cat face on it?

26:21.748 --> 26:22.749
Um.

26:36.388 --> 26:37.848
Hey, I owe you a cigarette.

26:40.017 --> 26:42.102
It's cool, but thanks.

26:49.568 --> 26:50.819
Do you have weed?

26:54.281 --> 26:55.449
[traffic]

27:56.385 --> 27:57.386
So.

27:58.720 --> 28:00.347
I'm sorry about the other night.

28:01.014 --> 28:02.641
About being a bitch.

28:03.767 --> 28:05.227
You weren't.

28:05.310 --> 28:06.895
Oh, I was.

28:07.688 --> 28:09.189
I had a shitty day.

28:09.857 --> 28:11.400
I guess I took it out on you.

28:13.652 --> 28:15.279
Do you want to talk about it?

28:16.446 --> 28:17.906
You sound like my therapist.

28:19.199 --> 28:20.200
[exclaims]

28:22.870 --> 28:24.913
I was supposed to get
a call back about a movie,

28:24.997 --> 28:26.373
and it never happened.

28:29.293 --> 28:30.711
So you're an actress?

28:31.378 --> 28:33.380
I've done a few
shorts in a web series.

28:34.506 --> 28:37.509
I'm a filmmaker myself.

28:41.722 --> 28:43.015
Anything I've seen?

28:44.641 --> 28:45.642
No.

28:46.727 --> 28:48.270
Sorry. I am a bitch.

28:49.062 --> 28:50.314
You're not.

29:25.724 --> 29:27.100
Do you want to watch a movie?

29:59.424 --> 30:00.717
My girl.

30:04.471 --> 30:05.889
Come on, get up.

30:08.475 --> 30:10.394
Why do you do this to yourself?

30:43.886 --> 30:45.137
That was beautiful.

30:48.724 --> 30:51.852
-Yeah?
-Yeah. You're super fucked up.

30:58.025 --> 30:59.443
Thank you.

31:00.068 --> 31:01.820
For showing this to me.

31:05.490 --> 31:06.909
Your welcome.

31:14.708 --> 31:16.001
I mean, I...

31:17.836 --> 31:19.254
I wanted to show you.

31:27.721 --> 31:29.264
I should go.

31:31.975 --> 31:33.352
Where should I put this?

31:52.120 --> 31:53.622
Well, thanks.

31:54.456 --> 31:55.916
No problem.

31:57.501 --> 32:00.170
I mean, I was happy
to smoke a little weed.

32:04.466 --> 32:06.093
We'll do it again soon.

32:08.178 --> 32:09.429
I'd like that.

32:12.558 --> 32:14.476
We should do it again soon.

32:18.313 --> 32:20.107
-I should, um...
-Yeah.

32:50.762 --> 32:52.014
Are you--

32:53.390 --> 32:54.391
hungry?

32:55.058 --> 32:56.226
[elevator dings]

32:57.477 --> 32:58.854
[relaxing music]

33:06.695 --> 33:08.030
Do you like it here?

33:11.867 --> 33:13.118
I mean the city.

33:13.869 --> 33:14.870
Oh.

33:15.829 --> 33:17.122
Yeah, it's okay.

33:21.126 --> 33:22.961
Where are you from exactly?

33:24.838 --> 33:26.423
Um, D.C..

33:27.508 --> 33:28.884
I'm from Montreal.

33:30.636 --> 33:32.012
What brought you here?

33:33.847 --> 33:36.099
-School.
-Film school?

33:36.183 --> 33:37.184
Yeah.

33:37.893 --> 33:40.896
And that's what you wanna do?
You want to make movies?

33:41.813 --> 33:42.814
Yeah.

33:45.400 --> 33:46.985
And what would you
do if you couldn't?

33:50.322 --> 33:51.698
I don't mean that--

33:51.782 --> 33:53.408
I've never really
thought about it.

33:56.370 --> 34:01.166
Even as a kid, I had all
these self-imposed deadlines.

34:01.250 --> 34:05.212
You know, if I don't
have an agent by 16,

34:05.295 --> 34:08.422
or my first feature by 21,

34:08.507 --> 34:13.094
I'd let it go and become
a doctor, or something.

34:16.014 --> 34:17.724
I guess it's a bit
late for that, huh?

34:27.734 --> 34:29.110
So tell me something.

34:32.989 --> 34:34.992
-Something.
-Um.

34:36.243 --> 34:38.328
What's your longest
relationship?

34:45.210 --> 34:46.628
I've never really had one.

34:53.051 --> 34:54.469
I know what you mean.

35:01.185 --> 35:03.020
Are you working
on anything right now?

35:04.188 --> 35:06.815
Got some ideas here and there.

35:09.067 --> 35:10.694
I'm doing photography.

35:13.572 --> 35:15.157
Are you any good?

35:18.493 --> 35:20.120
I'm just screwing with you.

35:24.041 --> 35:28.670
Well, if you ever need
a model, I'm pretty good.

35:30.422 --> 35:31.798
I'm going to hold you to that.

35:54.321 --> 35:55.656
[door opens]

36:50.252 --> 36:51.670
[phone dials]

36:56.592 --> 36:57.593
Hello?

36:58.760 --> 36:59.761
Hey.

37:01.096 --> 37:02.806
I think you've got
the wrong number.

37:02.890 --> 37:04.183
It's Jared.

37:05.517 --> 37:06.768
From upstairs?

37:06.852 --> 37:08.812
Oh, hey.

37:10.105 --> 37:11.732
So what's up?

37:11.815 --> 37:13.066
Not much.

37:14.568 --> 37:19.156
Uh, just wondering if you want
to do the photography thing.

37:20.574 --> 37:21.575
Photography?

37:23.076 --> 37:26.663
'Cause you mentioned before that
you had done some modeling.

37:30.292 --> 37:31.293
Hello?

37:31.793 --> 37:34.338
Oh. Yeah, um...

37:35.297 --> 37:36.882
Yeah. When were you thinking?

37:36.965 --> 37:37.966
Um.

37:39.134 --> 37:41.637
-Now?
-Um.

37:43.639 --> 37:45.766
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

37:46.642 --> 37:49.102
Can you give me
an hour to get ready?

37:49.436 --> 37:50.437
Yeah.

37:51.104 --> 37:53.315
Okay, cool. I'll just
text you when I'm ready,

37:53.398 --> 37:54.691
and then meet downstairs?

37:54.775 --> 37:57.069
-Okay.
-Okay, cool.

37:57.152 --> 37:58.737
I'll see you soon.

37:58.820 --> 37:59.988
See ya.

38:16.213 --> 38:17.297
[soft music]

39:58.857 --> 40:00.234
So what I asked you before.

40:00.984 --> 40:02.528
To think of your first memory.

40:05.447 --> 40:07.574
I just want to know
what you were thinking about.

40:09.743 --> 40:10.911
My dad.

40:14.331 --> 40:16.416
I don't know
if this is my first memory,

40:16.500 --> 40:19.253
but I was five or six.

40:20.712 --> 40:24.383
And I was home alone.
My parents were both at work.

40:25.425 --> 40:29.680
My best friend Bonnie just
got this new game Duck Hunt.

40:29.763 --> 40:30.931
So, um--

40:31.014 --> 40:33.433
Oh, I've played
my fair share of Duck Hunt.

40:34.059 --> 40:35.060
Right?

40:36.186 --> 40:39.106
So I'm at her place.

40:40.190 --> 40:41.692
We're playing,
so we're going good.

40:41.775 --> 40:44.236
Then my dad shows up
and he's panicked.

40:44.319 --> 40:47.406
I guess he called the house,

40:47.489 --> 40:50.784
and when I didn't
answer he freaked.

40:50.868 --> 40:52.578
And he, um--

40:52.661 --> 40:56.415
He left work. He just
walked out and came to find me.

40:56.790 --> 40:59.918
I just remember
being so mad at him.

41:00.002 --> 41:01.587
Because he messed up my playdate

41:01.670 --> 41:04.464
and couldn't play
the game anymore.

41:04.548 --> 41:07.718
But I guess it's a pretty
good memory.

41:10.053 --> 41:11.263
How so?

41:12.014 --> 41:13.557
I mean, he cared enough.

41:13.640 --> 41:14.641
Yeah.

41:17.019 --> 41:19.146
So you must be close
with your dad then?

41:20.147 --> 41:21.857
Yeah, I was.

41:27.237 --> 41:31.450
Um, he passed away
right before I moved here.

41:34.578 --> 41:36.079
Sorry, I didn't--

41:37.122 --> 41:38.415
It is what it is.

41:49.343 --> 41:50.844
I knew you were
going to do that.

41:51.303 --> 41:52.679
Am I that obvious?

41:52.763 --> 41:54.306
Super-duper obvious.

Hey.

44:11.985 --> 44:13.278
Are you cold?

[chatting]

44:59.241 --> 45:00.576
[Jared cries]

45:50.209 --> 45:51.460
Please stop.

45:52.794 --> 45:54.588
Don't be like that.

46:01.261 --> 46:02.721
You have a boyfriend.

46:03.847 --> 46:04.848
So?

46:07.976 --> 46:08.977
So.

46:10.020 --> 46:11.980
You can't be mine.

46:12.397 --> 46:13.524
[giggles]

46:14.566 --> 46:16.860
I don't belong to anyone.

46:19.279 --> 46:21.365
It's not like I'm married.

46:23.951 --> 46:24.952
Besides...

46:26.286 --> 46:28.622
True love triumphs
in the end, right?

46:35.128 --> 46:36.505
Oh, god.

46:38.090 --> 46:39.716
I just want to love you.

47:00.696 --> 47:01.697
Hey.

47:02.531 --> 47:03.532
Hey.

47:04.741 --> 47:06.618
-It's me.
-What's up?

47:09.288 --> 47:10.289
[exclaims]

47:11.039 --> 47:14.459
Uh, nothing. I just
wanted to give you a call

47:14.543 --> 47:17.421
and let you know I got
those photographs that we did.

47:17.504 --> 47:19.256
-I got them printed.
-Oh, nice.

47:23.886 --> 47:28.807
So I can show them
to you if you want.

47:30.142 --> 47:31.435
Yeah, for sure.

47:33.937 --> 47:36.064
I could come by
and show them to you.

47:38.150 --> 47:39.985
Yeah. When do you
want to come by?

47:41.195 --> 47:42.404
How about now?

47:44.448 --> 47:49.870
Um, my boyfriend's here
right now, so tomorrow?

47:50.537 --> 47:52.080
Can you do around noon?

47:53.373 --> 47:57.252
Yeah. Yeah, let's do that then.

47:58.045 --> 47:59.796
Okay, see you then.

47:59.880 --> 48:01.715
Uh, yeah. See ya.

48:04.635 --> 48:06.136
[sad music]

48:10.599 --> 48:11.975
That's really cool.

48:12.601 --> 48:15.062
-Yeah.
-I had such a wave.

48:23.445 --> 48:24.863
That's super cool.

48:51.265 --> 48:52.766
That's amazing.

48:53.141 --> 48:54.142
Yeah.

49:01.733 --> 49:03.151
Can I get a copy of these?

49:03.235 --> 49:04.987
-These are for you.
-[exclaims]

49:05.070 --> 49:07.698
-These are all for you.
-Thank you. You're awesome.

49:07.781 --> 49:09.116
Have I told you that?

49:10.826 --> 49:13.620
I think my boyfriend
will really love this one.

49:15.747 --> 49:17.332
Maybe I'll get a frame for him.

49:31.305 --> 49:32.598
[phone buzzes]

49:41.315 --> 49:42.608
What is it?

49:43.358 --> 49:45.402
[sister] Mom asked
me to give you a call.

49:47.905 --> 49:49.573
Said she was worried about you.

49:51.950 --> 49:52.951
Oh.

49:54.620 --> 49:58.248
Look, I figured you weren't
going to talk to me, so,

49:58.498 --> 50:00.542
I went ahead and booked
a session with my life coach

50:00.626 --> 50:01.668
for you.

50:04.713 --> 50:06.965
And I really think
this could be good for you.

50:10.260 --> 50:14.097
I'm kind of busy these days.

50:17.392 --> 50:20.187
Well, it's already
been paid for.

50:20.270 --> 50:21.730
So it's up to you.

50:25.859 --> 50:30.531
You know, it's not good
being a lone wolf all the time.

50:47.422 --> 50:48.924

50:55.848 --> 50:58.100
-Sorry.
-Don't be sorry.

51:00.435 --> 51:04.231
I'm just wondering what I can
do to get all of your attention.

51:08.652 --> 51:11.113
Maybe if I took this bikini off?

51:12.656 --> 51:14.199
I just want you to be you.

51:20.247 --> 51:21.874
Why don't you tell
me about your day?

51:25.544 --> 51:28.672
I spent some time
with this girl.

51:30.841 --> 51:32.301
Do you like her?

51:38.515 --> 51:40.267
Why don't you tell me about her?

51:45.105 --> 51:47.983
I just feel that
when I'm with her,

51:48.066 --> 51:51.153
that I never know
what's going to happen next.

51:53.864 --> 51:55.157
Are you in love?

51:55.240 --> 51:57.159
Sounds like you're in love.

52:00.913 --> 52:02.581
Why don't you describe her?

52:05.042 --> 52:06.960
We like the same things.

52:10.631 --> 52:12.925
I think we're a good match,
like, physically.

52:13.675 --> 52:15.511
Sounds like you're
really feeling her.

52:19.056 --> 52:21.099
She's got a really nice smile.

52:24.144 --> 52:26.355
And when she smiles, I smile.

52:29.525 --> 52:32.444
And I like her hair.

52:34.947 --> 52:36.823
What color is her hair?

52:41.537 --> 52:42.538
Black.

52:43.038 --> 52:44.456
Like mine?

52:45.415 --> 52:47.668
You have a type, Mr. Darcy.

52:53.090 --> 52:55.008
She has a boyfriend.

52:59.930 --> 53:02.641
Are you sure I can't
lose this bikini for you?

53:08.897 --> 53:10.899
I just want you to be you.

53:16.363 --> 53:18.073
Can you just be you?

53:21.994 --> 53:23.453
It's all I want.

[muttered argument]

53:59.031 --> 54:01.992

I've wanted to do and you said--

[man] None of my friends have
to deal with this bullshit

54:05.329 --> 54:07.039
when it comes
to their girlfriends.

54:07.122 --> 54:09.374
I'm trying to be supportive,
but I don't fucking understand--

54:09.458 --> 54:11.168
You're trying to be supportive,
but you want me to be an actor

54:11.251 --> 54:13.670
that has no kissing scenes,
no love scenes.

54:14.671 --> 54:16.840
Do you know how fucking
unrealistic that is?

54:16.924 --> 54:19.927
If you want to be a fucking
actress, why can't you do, like,

54:20.010 --> 54:21.261
commercials, or something?

54:21.345 --> 54:22.429
I mean, there's money in that.

54:22.513 --> 54:24.389
I don't see you
coming home with anything.

54:24.973 --> 54:27.935
I mean, you know,
I helped you out with rent.

54:28.310 --> 54:30.062
I don't know what
I can say that will help you

54:30.145 --> 54:31.480
to understand this.

54:32.314 --> 54:35.734
I want to be supportive. I don't
want to shit on every single--

55:13.105 --> 55:14.106
Hey.

Sorry about before.

No, it's okay.

Um, what's up?

55:30.289 --> 55:31.540
Can I come over?

Now?

55:38.422 --> 55:39.423
Yeah.

Sure. Yeah.

[voices on TV]

Are you okay?

56:16.960 --> 56:18.253
It's stupid.

56:20.130 --> 56:21.965
He's fucking stupid.

56:28.472 --> 56:29.848
I got that role.

56:32.226 --> 56:33.977
The one you helped
me audition for.

56:40.234 --> 56:42.736
-That's great.
-Yeah.

56:47.157 --> 56:50.619
And when I told him,
he did this whole, like,

56:50.702 --> 56:52.329
Dr. Jekyll thing.

56:55.332 --> 56:56.500
You know.

56:57.668 --> 56:59.586
He actually had
the nerve to say,

57:00.879 --> 57:02.422
"What if we had kids?"

57:06.051 --> 57:08.220
Just 'cause of the sex scenes.

57:15.936 --> 57:17.896
I'm just so fucking tired.

57:22.818 --> 57:24.570
I think he's really stupid.

57:27.239 --> 57:28.240
Yeah.

57:33.328 --> 57:34.580
You're really great.

57:39.126 --> 57:41.211
See, why'd I just
date someone like you?

58:21.877 --> 58:23.253
I'm so sorry.

58:47.361 --> 58:48.362
I'm sorry.

58:51.031 --> 58:53.784
Takes a while to get
to know each other this way.

58:55.619 --> 58:56.995
Yeah, but...

58:59.248 --> 59:00.791
I just wanted
to be good for you.

59:02.251 --> 59:03.669
You're adorable.

59:06.922 --> 59:08.715
There's something
I have to tell you.

59:09.842 --> 59:11.343
I should have told you.

59:14.137 --> 59:15.472
You can tell me.

59:22.604 --> 59:24.106
This was my first time.

59:28.402 --> 59:29.403
Yeah.

59:30.529 --> 59:31.655
I know.

59:35.367 --> 59:37.911
After we met, I looked you up.

59:39.621 --> 59:40.873
And I found...

59:42.249 --> 59:44.251
the video that you posted.

59:47.546 --> 59:52.467
I thought that was really
sweet telling the world

59:52.551 --> 59:54.428
how ugly that you were a virgin.

59:55.554 --> 59:56.847
That takes some guts.

59:58.473 --> 01:00:02.853
And I felt how sad you were.

01:00:07.274 --> 01:00:08.525
And I get that.

01:00:15.824 --> 01:00:17.576
Do you forgive me for creeping?

01:00:27.419 --> 01:00:30.714
I played this scene
before in my head so many times.

01:00:34.009 --> 01:00:35.552
I'm not going anywhere.

01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:41.308
I hate being alone.

01:00:42.476 --> 01:00:44.228
Maybe because you're alone.

01:01:01.119 --> 01:01:02.496
[typing]

01:01:34.444 --> 01:01:35.779

01:02:16.278 --> 01:02:18.655
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:02:18.739 --> 01:02:20.199
What are you doing here?

01:02:22.117 --> 01:02:23.368
I came to see you.

01:02:25.162 --> 01:02:26.830
I texted you last night.

01:02:27.831 --> 01:02:31.335
You didn't answer me, so I just
wanted to check up on you.

01:02:31.502 --> 01:02:32.753
My phone died.

01:02:32.836 --> 01:02:33.837
[exclaims]

01:02:34.588 --> 01:02:36.215
Was there something
you wanted to talk about?

01:02:38.133 --> 01:02:40.135
Um, do you want
to grab breakfast?

01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:42.888
A quick talk over coffee.

01:02:42.971 --> 01:02:46.475
Now's not a great time.
My boyfriend's here.

01:02:50.145 --> 01:02:52.105
-Is he leaving?
-What?

01:02:55.692 --> 01:02:57.528
I saw you guys
fighting last night.

01:02:59.029 --> 01:03:03.617
I just assumed then that you
were in a fight of some sort--

01:03:08.997 --> 01:03:12.835
We fought and then we made up.

01:03:14.336 --> 01:03:16.171
Is that what you
wanted to talk about?

01:03:19.216 --> 01:03:21.635
No. I, uh...

01:03:25.055 --> 01:03:28.433
I should go.

01:03:28.517 --> 01:03:30.853
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to bug you.

01:03:30.936 --> 01:03:33.814
Um, I can do breakfast on...

01:03:35.899 --> 01:03:37.860
Um, Saturday?

01:03:40.821 --> 01:03:41.822
Yeah.

01:03:42.155 --> 01:03:43.907
Okay. I'll see you then,

01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:45.701
Yeah.

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:53.333

[ominous music continues]

01:05:22.464 --> 01:05:23.465
Hey.

01:05:27.135 --> 01:05:28.929
What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

01:05:33.809 --> 01:05:36.186
No. I'm talking to you.

01:05:38.313 --> 01:05:40.232
What the fuck do you
think you're doing, man?

01:05:41.608 --> 01:05:43.360
I don't know what
you're doing, man.

01:05:45.153 --> 01:05:46.154
What?

01:05:47.739 --> 01:05:48.907
[mumbling]

01:05:50.742 --> 01:05:51.994

01:06:07.342 --> 01:06:08.343
Hey.

01:06:14.141 --> 01:06:15.184
[groans]

01:06:35.746 --> 01:06:37.206
[knocking]

01:06:47.549 --> 01:06:48.759
Are you there?

01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:56.350
Let me in.

01:07:04.066 --> 01:07:05.859
It's just me. Open up.

01:08:02.082 --> 01:08:03.375
[water running]

01:08:48.795 --> 01:08:50.464
I'm so sorry about all this.

01:08:53.966 --> 01:08:57.554
We were fighting.
Well, you saw us.

01:09:00.515 --> 01:09:02.184
And then you
showed up in the morning

01:09:02.267 --> 01:09:05.270
and he started asking about you,
and got all paranoid.

01:09:05.354 --> 01:09:06.729
Thought you liked me.

01:09:21.453 --> 01:09:22.662
I do like you.

01:09:36.801 --> 01:09:38.095
You "like, like" me?

01:09:45.894 --> 01:09:47.437
You know I have a boyfriend.

01:09:53.151 --> 01:09:54.570
You know that I love him?

01:09:58.657 --> 01:09:59.908
I do.

01:10:03.370 --> 01:10:06.874
Did you think something
was going to happen here?

01:10:19.636 --> 01:10:21.013
I thought.

01:10:26.185 --> 01:10:27.895
How long have you
thought this way?

01:10:47.664 --> 01:10:48.999
Since I saw you.

01:10:51.585 --> 01:10:52.586
Okay.

01:11:01.553 --> 01:11:03.013
[door opens and closes]

01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:37.798
Why don't I just
date someone like you?

01:11:37.881 --> 01:11:39.341
I just want to make you happy.

01:11:41.426 --> 01:11:42.678
[giggles]

01:11:45.138 --> 01:11:46.139
[ominous music]

01:11:56.316 --> 01:11:58.110
I just want you to like me.

01:12:00.153 --> 01:12:01.446
That's all.

01:12:01.530 --> 01:12:03.282
Did you think
I'd leave him for you?

01:12:07.995 --> 01:12:08.996
Maybe.

01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:15.335
[indistinct]

01:12:17.337 --> 01:12:19.047
Get out of my head now, please.

01:12:20.007 --> 01:12:23.468
I was reciprocating
friendliness, man. Nothing more.

01:12:26.263 --> 01:12:27.848
Can you just leave my head now?

01:12:28.265 --> 01:12:33.604
Oh, gone puppy dog
on this whole thing.

01:12:34.104 --> 01:12:36.356
Over one scenario.

01:12:37.149 --> 01:12:39.193
Chemistry and connection.

01:12:40.152 --> 01:12:42.779
[indistinct]

01:12:46.742 --> 01:12:49.578
It's your own fault
if you overthink it with me.

01:12:53.457 --> 01:12:55.000
I just want to love you.

01:13:03.675 --> 01:13:04.927
This isn't what I want.

01:13:09.139 --> 01:13:10.641
If you ever think about me,

01:13:10.724 --> 01:13:12.518
you might as well
just put your head--

01:13:12.684 --> 01:13:13.769
[glass shatters]

01:13:37.668 --> 01:13:38.877
[ominous music]

01:15:06.965 --> 01:15:08.342
Did you miss me?

01:15:10.761 --> 01:15:12.554
That's what I like to hear.

01:15:16.141 --> 01:15:18.352
No, of course, I miss you guys.

01:15:20.145 --> 01:15:22.147
It's what I look forward to.

01:15:25.192 --> 01:15:28.862
I had a very stressful day.

01:15:30.822 --> 01:15:32.950
So, yeah.

01:15:34.451 --> 01:15:36.620
You're like
my bad little addiction.

01:15:37.246 --> 01:15:39.039
You're like my cigarette.

01:15:48.423 --> 01:15:50.384
Oh, we can talk
about that in private.

01:15:51.635 --> 01:15:52.970
[gun cocks]

01:15:59.059 --> 01:16:00.602
You're sweet.

01:16:03.897 --> 01:16:05.607
You want me to take this off?

01:16:06.358 --> 01:16:08.402
Don't you like it?
Isn't it nice?

01:16:18.954 --> 01:16:20.873
Oh, we can talk about
that if it's the two of us.

01:16:28.589 --> 01:16:29.590
Yeah?

01:16:31.133 --> 01:16:32.426
Of course.

01:16:35.888 --> 01:16:37.306
You know.

01:16:47.024 --> 01:16:48.400
[knocking]

01:16:48.775 --> 01:16:51.695
You know, we don't we just go?

01:16:51.778 --> 01:16:53.614
The two of us
can talk about that.

01:16:54.781 --> 01:16:55.782
Yeah?

01:16:56.450 --> 01:16:57.743
[knocking]

01:17:01.622 --> 01:17:03.624
Will you wait
for me just one minute?

01:17:05.292 --> 01:17:06.293
'Kay.

01:17:09.296 --> 01:17:11.048
Don't go anywhere.
