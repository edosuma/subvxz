WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:03.003
GILES: Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

00:03.036 --> 00:06.807
Look at you. All afraid
I'm hot for your honey.
Because you are.

00:06.839 --> 00:09.676
SPIKE: "They had to be
 certain the Slayer would
 protect it with her life,

00:09.710 --> 00:12.712
so they sent the key to her
 in the form of a sister."

00:12.746 --> 00:15.148
I'm not real.
You're the key.

00:15.182 --> 00:17.550
Go. Before she finds you.
Don't--

00:17.585 --> 00:19.053
She's here.

00:19.086 --> 00:21.355
Ben. He was here.
He was trying to help me.

00:21.388 --> 00:24.292
He might've left
before Glory came.
I can't remember.

00:25.359 --> 00:28.696
(rock music playing)

00:35.368 --> 00:40.441
* I'm amused
by the overwhelming choices *

00:40.473 --> 00:45.213
* I guess the hardest part
is knowing when to stop *

00:45.246 --> 00:50.551
* Yeah, I'm confused and I
think I'm hearing voices *

00:50.584 --> 00:55.689
* 'Cause you're
happening so fast
gonna save the best for last *

00:55.722 --> 00:58.926
SPIKE:
Bleedin' crime is what it is.

01:01.295 --> 01:04.864
Jackin' up the bar price
to pay for fixin' up
this sinkhole.

01:04.897 --> 01:07.468
Not my fault
the insurance doesn't
cover "act of troll."

01:07.501 --> 01:11.638
Gee. Maybe it's time
you found a new place
to patronize.

01:11.671 --> 01:14.807
I've half a mind to,
especially since
the flowering onion

01:14.841 --> 01:16.977
got remodeled right off
the soddin' menu.

01:17.010 --> 01:18.811
That's the only thing
this place had
going for it.

01:20.180 --> 01:24.385
What are you doing?
What do you mean,
what am I--

01:24.418 --> 01:27.721
Here... at this table,

01:27.754 --> 01:30.658
talking to me like
we're some kind of
talking buddies?

01:32.659 --> 01:36.096
Well, I saw you
sittin' here alone.

01:36.129 --> 01:39.832
Thought, I don't know,
you could maybe do with
a bit of, you know, company.

01:44.972 --> 01:46.140
Suit yourself.

01:48.876 --> 01:50.510
Well...

01:50.543 --> 01:53.079
it's just,
we took on that
Glory chippie together.

01:53.112 --> 01:55.515
I was right there with you,
fightin' the fight.

01:55.549 --> 01:57.918
Actually, you were
sleeping the sleep
of the knocked unconscious.

01:57.950 --> 02:01.155
Yeah. Still, points
for intent. All right, you'd
think that would be enough

02:01.188 --> 02:04.992
to cut me a sliver of slack,
earn me a little
consideration, respect.

02:05.025 --> 02:06.394
XANDER: Hey, Evil Dead,
you're in my seat.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.164
Bugger it.

02:17.704 --> 02:20.640
Xander, I think
you may have
hurt his feelings.

02:20.674 --> 02:22.575
And you should never
hurt the feelings
of a brutal killer.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.213
You know, that's actually
some pretty good advice.

02:28.181 --> 02:31.151
So, who's up for some more
liquid refreshments?

02:31.185 --> 02:34.854
I'm buying,
for I am Payday Man.
I could use a water.

02:34.888 --> 02:38.391
Water poses no challenge
for Payday Man,
for I have--

02:38.425 --> 02:40.260
Hey, where's my change?

02:44.897 --> 02:46.533
Spike, you diabolical fiend.

02:47.935 --> 02:51.003
Poor Wil.
Still getting those headaches?

02:51.038 --> 02:53.674
Fewer and further between,
but, yep.

02:53.706 --> 02:55.975
They're still exercising
their visitation rights.

02:56.009 --> 03:00.681
Honey, in case you didn't
hear me the first 6,000 times,
no more teleportation spells.

03:00.713 --> 03:04.084
Well, it's just
we have squat in the way
of Glory-fighting arsenal,

03:04.116 --> 03:05.818
and another run-in
with her,

03:05.853 --> 03:09.257
and my headaches and
nosebleeds are gonna be
the least of our problems.

03:09.289 --> 03:12.659
You know what?
This is the first "R and R"
I've had in weeks.

03:12.693 --> 03:15.062
How about we go
one night without saying
the name "Glory"?

03:15.094 --> 03:18.331
I'm down with that.
Let's just call "she who will
not be named" another name.

03:18.365 --> 03:20.067
Let's just call her--
Ben.

03:20.099 --> 03:22.703
TARA: for example.
I'll be right back.

03:24.305 --> 03:26.507
Ben. Hey.
Buffy, hi.

03:26.539 --> 03:30.277
I barely recognized you
without your hospital scrubs.

03:30.311 --> 03:35.182
Oh, you'd be surprised
the extent of my wardrobe.
Really?

03:35.215 --> 03:38.352
I actually have
entire outfits that
aren't blue pajamas.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.388
(laughs)

03:40.420 --> 03:44.557
Um, my sister,
uh, told me what happened
at the hospital

03:44.591 --> 03:46.960
right before
I got there.
Uh-huh.

03:46.993 --> 03:50.129
And I just wanted
to say thanks...

03:51.230 --> 03:52.966
for looking after her.

03:54.668 --> 03:57.937
That's okay.
I'm glad Dawn's all right.

03:57.971 --> 04:01.908
The point is,
I work hard for that money.
And you're saying I didn't?

04:01.942 --> 04:05.479
You stole it.
And you're making it
into very hard work.

04:05.513 --> 04:08.415
Listen, bleach boy.
I don't have a chip
in my head.

04:08.449 --> 04:11.551
I can do far more damage to you
than you can ever do to me.

04:11.585 --> 04:14.153
Yeah?
(Buffy laughs)

04:15.254 --> 04:16.524
Like you could
ever hurt me.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.959
(horn blaring)

04:49.856 --> 04:53.026
Sunnydale Station.
Last stop this line.

05:14.581 --> 05:17.016
Oh, god!
Oh, please!

05:17.050 --> 05:18.851
Help me!
Somebody, please!

05:18.886 --> 05:22.622
Help me! Somebody!

05:22.656 --> 05:24.358
(screaming)

06:21.781 --> 06:24.250
Buffy?
(TV noise)

06:24.283 --> 06:27.620
Back by popular demand.
Did you have a nice time?

06:29.088 --> 06:32.125
You know, I think I did.
Much-needed fun,

06:32.158 --> 06:35.062
apart from Willow's headaches
and Spike's cameo appearance.

06:35.095 --> 06:37.096
Spike was there?

06:37.129 --> 06:40.067
Unfortunately.
Well, I'm relieved
that you're home,

06:40.100 --> 06:43.069
'cause, to be honest,
I wasn't feeling all
that safe with you gone...

06:44.971 --> 06:47.106
at first...

06:47.139 --> 06:50.409
and then I remembered
that Rupert was here,

06:50.444 --> 06:53.781
and I felt much, much safer.
Yes. Thank you
for the little backpedal,

06:53.814 --> 06:58.619
but I'm forced to agree that I'm
barely an adequate substitute
for a Slayer in the house.

06:58.651 --> 07:01.187
Good night.
JOYCE:
Good night.

07:04.423 --> 07:07.761
So, how is Dawn?
She's coping very well--

07:07.795 --> 07:13.100
Extremely well, considering
the extraordinary circumstances
of her origin.

07:13.132 --> 07:14.802
Then let me
ask you something.

07:14.834 --> 07:19.139
Um... we've been going easy
on her the last week,

07:19.172 --> 07:22.009
letting things slide.
Oh, I don't think
that's at all wise.

07:22.042 --> 07:24.244
You don't?
About the best thing
you can do now

07:24.276 --> 07:26.980
is behave exactly
as you always have.

07:27.014 --> 07:31.117
Any special treatment at this
stage is likely to undermine
Dawn's sense of normality.

07:31.151 --> 07:33.319
You think so?
Absolutely.

07:33.353 --> 07:35.154
Thanks.

07:35.187 --> 07:37.790
Dawn!
What?

07:37.824 --> 07:41.127
What did I tell you about
borrowing my clothing?
I didn't take your clothes.

07:41.161 --> 07:42.930
Bull!
I never touched your stuff.

07:42.963 --> 07:45.733
Really? Then what happened
to my blue cashmere sweater?

07:47.534 --> 07:49.836
HARMONY:
Spikey.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.672
Aren't you coming to bed?

07:51.704 --> 07:54.007
I'm not tired.

07:54.040 --> 07:55.543
Me neither.

07:58.745 --> 08:01.247
Don't you want
to come in and...

08:02.482 --> 08:03.817
tire me out?

08:03.850 --> 08:07.954
Harm, really not
in the mood right now.

08:07.987 --> 08:11.158
(sighs)
You're never in the mood.

08:15.062 --> 08:17.029
We could do something
different tonight.

08:17.064 --> 08:19.766
Like what, you stop
yammering for two seconds?

08:21.535 --> 08:23.903
Well, we could...

08:23.937 --> 08:26.038
I don't know...

08:26.072 --> 08:28.007
maybe play a game?

08:33.446 --> 08:36.216
Oh, I'm gonna stake you.

08:36.249 --> 08:39.852
I'm coming after you,
you bad, evil vampire,

08:39.885 --> 08:42.254
and I'm gonna slay you!

08:43.624 --> 08:48.327
I'm sneaking up,
and I'm gonna stake you
so much

08:48.360 --> 08:52.765
with my slaying powers
that I have, because
I'm the chosen--

08:52.799 --> 08:54.902
Whoo! Ohh!
(growling)

08:54.934 --> 08:57.169
Oh, Spike.

08:57.203 --> 09:00.373
WILLOW:
I just don't see why he
couldn't end up with Esmeralda.

09:00.407 --> 09:04.543
They could have had
the wedding right there,
Beneath the very bell tower

09:04.577 --> 09:07.715
where he labored thanklessly
for all those years.

09:07.815 --> 09:09.548
No. See, it can't--
it can't end like that,

09:09.582 --> 09:12.284
'cause all
of Quasimodo's actions
were selfishly motivated.

09:12.318 --> 09:15.254
He had no moral compass,
no understanding of right.

09:15.288 --> 09:19.025
Everything he did he did out
of love for a woman who'd never
be able to love him back.

09:19.058 --> 09:23.263
Also, you can tell it's
not gonna have a happy ending
when the main guy's all bumpy.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.201
What did you think,
Buffy?

09:29.235 --> 09:33.105
The test isn't till tomorrow,
right? I don't have an opinion
'til then.

09:33.139 --> 09:35.542
But you read it,
right?

09:35.575 --> 09:38.110
Kind of not.
I rented the movie.

09:38.144 --> 09:41.480
Oh, with, um--
with Charles Laughton?

09:41.514 --> 09:43.951
I don't know.
Was he one of
the singing gargoyles?

09:43.984 --> 09:46.653
Oh, boy.
I-- I'm kidding.

09:49.121 --> 09:52.491
You're done with this?
Yeah, hi. Uh,
kind of reading that?

09:54.427 --> 09:56.929
BUFFY:
"Six found murdered on train
at Sunnydale Station."

09:56.963 --> 09:59.732
Glory?

09:59.767 --> 10:03.370
"Unconfirmed reports of
severe trauma to the throats
of one or more of the victims."

10:05.605 --> 10:08.541
Survey says... vampire.

10:12.879 --> 10:17.250
Oh, it's you.
What are you doing here
lurking about?

10:17.283 --> 10:19.919
I'm not lurking.

10:19.952 --> 10:22.288
I'm looking.
What are you doing?

10:22.322 --> 10:23.691
Nothing.

10:25.057 --> 10:26.894
So, is that how
you get around town
in the daytime?

10:28.561 --> 10:31.630
I mean, does that
lead into the sewers
or something?

10:31.664 --> 10:33.365
Can you show me?
No.

10:35.201 --> 10:36.568
Why are you--

10:38.205 --> 10:39.873
Does Buffy know
you're here?

10:39.907 --> 10:42.174
Huh! Yeah, right.

10:42.209 --> 10:45.011
'Cause nothing would
make her happier than
to find out I'm hanging out

10:45.044 --> 10:47.681
after school in
a vampire's lair.

10:47.715 --> 10:49.149
Especially yours.

10:50.750 --> 10:52.652
Go home then.

10:52.686 --> 10:55.722
I don't feel like it right now.
Well, you can't bloody well
stay here.

10:55.755 --> 10:58.225
Why not?
Because I've
got things to do.

10:58.258 --> 11:01.594
Bad, evil things...

11:03.230 --> 11:04.932
that are not
for a child's eyes.

11:06.767 --> 11:09.035
I'm not a child.

11:09.068 --> 11:10.570
I'm not even human.

11:11.839 --> 11:15.241
Not originally.
(sighs)

11:15.274 --> 11:17.476
Yeah, well,
originally, I was.

11:17.509 --> 11:19.746
I got over it.

11:19.779 --> 11:22.548
Doesn't seem to me
it matters very much
how you start out.

11:22.581 --> 11:24.250
That's smart.

11:25.451 --> 11:26.619
I get that.

11:29.756 --> 11:32.993
I like how you talk to me
like I can understand things.

11:33.025 --> 11:36.229
Everyone else is being
all twitchy and secretive.

11:36.263 --> 11:39.566
They're just trying
to keep you safe,
I expect.

11:39.599 --> 11:43.202
I feel safe with you.
(coughing)

11:43.235 --> 11:47.673
Take that back!
I mean, you have the
whole super power thing,

11:47.706 --> 11:50.243
and you're just
as tough as Buffy is.

11:50.277 --> 11:54.447
Maybe tougher.
Buffy thinks so, too.

11:54.480 --> 11:55.648
She does?

11:57.149 --> 11:59.753
Well, she's always worried
about what she's gonna do

11:59.787 --> 12:02.855
if you ever get that chip
out of your head.
Is that right?

12:02.889 --> 12:05.258
So, um...

12:07.394 --> 12:09.562
What else does Buffy
say about me?

12:11.398 --> 12:13.265
Hey!
JOYCE:
Dawn?

12:13.299 --> 12:15.869
No. It's me.

12:15.903 --> 12:18.605
Is Dawn with you?
Isn't she here?

12:18.638 --> 12:20.373
No, she didn't come home
from school today.

12:20.407 --> 12:23.375
Oh, Buffy,
the news said something
about people murdered--

12:23.409 --> 12:25.913
It's not Glory.
It has nothing to do
with Dawn. I promise.

12:25.946 --> 12:28.248
Look, she probably--

12:28.280 --> 12:29.649
I'll find her.

12:31.683 --> 12:34.386
DAWN:
And the lady
just invited you in?

12:34.421 --> 12:37.890
Well, I had hubby
by the throat, didn't I?

12:37.924 --> 12:40.027
Promised her he'd live
if she did the invite.

12:41.193 --> 12:43.663
And did you...
let him live?

12:43.696 --> 12:47.767
What do you think?
Too much for you?

12:47.801 --> 12:49.937
No. Keep going.

12:49.970 --> 12:52.672
And I kill 'em.

12:52.705 --> 12:54.774
Right quick.
The whole lot.

12:54.807 --> 12:58.610
But...
there's someone missing.

12:58.644 --> 13:00.847
There's supposed to be...

13:00.880 --> 13:02.381
this little girl...

13:03.984 --> 13:06.986
So, I get real quiet...

13:09.022 --> 13:14.126
and I hear this tiny noise
coming from the coal bin.

13:14.160 --> 13:16.129
This little sigh.

13:18.030 --> 13:22.668
So, I listened harder.
It's very, very quiet.

13:22.701 --> 13:24.171
(door opens)
(both gasp)

13:24.203 --> 13:27.975
Oh, bloody hell.
Spike, I need your help.
Dawn is...

13:29.642 --> 13:31.979
here.

13:32.011 --> 13:34.981
Spike was just telling a story,
and he was just at
this really cool part--

13:35.014 --> 13:37.783
What the hell is this?
What is she doing here?

13:37.817 --> 13:40.820
Just hanging out.
Here?

13:40.854 --> 13:44.857
Can you please
let him finish the story,
then you could do the lecture?

13:48.727 --> 13:51.965
Yeah. Okay.

13:51.999 --> 13:55.335
Let's hear the story
that Spike is telling
my little sister.

13:56.668 --> 14:00.173
Right. Yeah.

14:00.206 --> 14:03.342
So, uh, I knew the girl
was in the coal bin.

14:03.375 --> 14:06.712
And I rip it open,
very violent,
haul her out of there...

14:07.779 --> 14:09.982
and then I give her
to a good family

14:10.017 --> 14:12.351
in a nice home
where they're never,
ever mean to her.

14:12.384 --> 14:13.921
And didn't lock her
in a coal bin.

14:14.922 --> 14:17.557
What?
That's so lame.

14:17.590 --> 14:20.692
I was just about
to send her home.
I knew you'd be fretting.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.932
Dawn, get your stuff.
We're getting out of here.

14:28.368 --> 14:32.438
Why doesn't that
register with you?
Crypt plus vampire equals bad.

14:32.471 --> 14:33.941
'Cause it was Spike.

14:35.107 --> 14:38.177
Hanging out with Spike
is not cool, Dawn, okay?

14:38.211 --> 14:42.548
It is-- It is
dangerous and icky.

14:42.581 --> 14:45.817
I don't think Spike's icky.
Yeah, well,
think again, sister--

14:50.123 --> 14:52.658
You have a crush on him.
No, I don't.

14:54.061 --> 14:56.596
It's just...
(laughs)
he's got cool hair

14:56.629 --> 14:59.165
and he wears cool
leather coats and stuff.

15:00.267 --> 15:02.434
And he doesn't treat me
like an alien.

15:02.469 --> 15:05.272
He's a killer, Dawn.
You cannot have a crush
on something

15:05.304 --> 15:08.274
that is dead
and evil and a vampire.

15:08.307 --> 15:11.311
Right. That's why you
were never with Angel
for three years.

15:11.344 --> 15:14.246
Angel's different.
He has a soul.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.482
Spike has a chip.
Same diff.

15:16.515 --> 15:18.985
I can't listen to this!

15:19.019 --> 15:23.222
(sighs)
Spike is a monster, okay?

15:23.255 --> 15:25.825
And plus, you are
only 14 years old.

15:25.857 --> 15:29.629
I like hanging out
with him is all.

15:29.662 --> 15:33.133
And even if I did have a crush,
he wouldn't notice
in a million years.

15:33.165 --> 15:36.102
Not with you around.
What does that mean?

15:36.135 --> 15:38.270
Spike's totally into you.

15:40.974 --> 15:44.076
Oh, come on.
You didn't notice?

15:44.110 --> 15:46.778
Buffy,
Spike's completely
in love with you.

15:48.048 --> 15:49.816
Huh?

15:55.888 --> 15:58.125
So, tell me again
what we're looking for.

15:58.158 --> 16:01.660
Clues.
Okay.

16:01.693 --> 16:05.365
Could you give me a clue
about what kind of clues?

16:06.566 --> 16:08.701
(sighs)
Something. Anything.

16:10.669 --> 16:13.340
Just want to know
this was a vamp attack.

16:13.373 --> 16:15.942
If it was, how many
we're talking about.

16:15.975 --> 16:20.712
Well, Sunnydale's finest
didn't leave us a lot
of stuff to examine and...

16:20.746 --> 16:23.850
who knows how many people
have traipsed through here.
Xander?

16:23.883 --> 16:27.886
What?
Never mind.

16:32.259 --> 16:34.394
(sighs)
It's just that...

16:34.427 --> 16:36.263
Dawn said that--

16:37.429 --> 16:40.667
Yeah?
Forget it.

16:41.868 --> 16:43.070
Buffy.

16:44.703 --> 16:46.873
She thinks that--

16:46.905 --> 16:48.841
She said that--

16:50.576 --> 16:52.745
Spike's in love with me.

16:54.280 --> 16:57.317
(laughs)
I'm not joking.

16:57.350 --> 17:01.187
Oh, I hope not.
It's funnier if it's true.

17:01.221 --> 17:05.258
I'm serious.
Xander, this is serious.

17:05.290 --> 17:07.759
You're right.
(clears throat)

17:07.794 --> 17:11.730
(laughs)
It's creepy.

17:11.762 --> 17:15.067
No, not creepy.

17:15.102 --> 17:17.104
'Cause it's not real.

17:17.136 --> 17:21.272
I mean, how upset can you
really get over one of
Spike's fevered daydreams

17:21.307 --> 17:23.608
that's not gonna happen?
I guess.

17:23.643 --> 17:26.578
So, where did Dawn--

17:26.613 --> 17:30.650
How did she come
to this extremely
entertaining conclusion?

17:32.085 --> 17:34.287
She was hanging out
with Spike.

17:34.320 --> 17:38.290
I think she has
a crush on him.
What?

17:38.325 --> 17:42.095
I mean, I always knew
that he had this
weird fixation with me--

17:42.128 --> 17:46.398
I'm the one she
has a crush on. Me!
There's nothing here. Let's go.

17:46.432 --> 17:49.868
It's always been me.
Big, funny Xander.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.204
Oh, what?
She just suddenly decides
I'm not the cool one anymore?

17:52.239 --> 17:54.106
Why is that okay?

17:57.277 --> 18:01.480
But what they didn't get
was that it was a copy
of the bill of lading.

18:01.513 --> 18:04.083
So they thought that
it was another order form.

18:04.116 --> 18:07.586
So now I've got two shipments
of Greek amphorae on my hands.
(laughing)

18:07.619 --> 18:10.423
SPIKE: That's funny.
And really, how many
do you need? Amphorae.

18:10.457 --> 18:13.292
(laughing)
Oh, Buffy.

18:13.326 --> 18:18.897
Spike came by
to apologize for yesterday.
Our missing-child drama.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.468
And he just decided
to hang out for a while?

18:21.500 --> 18:25.471
Well, I got talking
about the gallery.
See, there was this--

18:25.505 --> 18:28.340
Oh, don't get us all
laughing again, Joyce.

18:28.375 --> 18:30.942
Anyhow, I really need
to talk to your eldest.
What about?

18:34.314 --> 18:36.982
I got a bit of info you
might be keen on knowing.

18:37.016 --> 18:41.086
Sorry. All out of cash.
Why don't you hit on Giles--
hitGiles.

18:41.119 --> 18:43.455
I got a bead on the guy
who killed those people.

18:43.490 --> 18:46.092
The ones on the train.
Do tell.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.228
I'll do better than that.
I'll show.

18:51.198 --> 18:53.766
What's the matter?
Nothing.

18:53.799 --> 18:56.935
Just--
(sighs)

18:56.969 --> 18:59.338
Two vamps holed up
in a warehouse downtown.

18:59.372 --> 19:02.709
Come on. What are you
waiting for? Grab your coat
and pointy sticks.

19:16.154 --> 19:17.356
Hey!

19:25.565 --> 19:28.401
Eww.
It's not blood.
It's bourbon.

19:28.434 --> 19:30.202
Eww.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.506
Suit yourself.

19:39.211 --> 19:41.113
(sighs)

19:42.249 --> 19:44.049
(humming)

19:46.786 --> 19:48.887
* I wanna be sedated

19:48.921 --> 19:51.824
Do you like the Ramones?

19:51.857 --> 19:54.594
So, if you're not doing this
for the money, why are you--
Shh!

19:56.095 --> 19:58.397
(distant chattering)

20:07.205 --> 20:09.040
(corn popping)

20:14.814 --> 20:16.648
The Slayer.

20:21.320 --> 20:23.890
Well,
that was sad.

20:25.592 --> 20:27.594
I'm embarrassed
for our kind.

20:28.994 --> 20:32.298
So, should we chase
after 'em then?

20:32.332 --> 20:34.767
They couldn't
have gone far.

20:34.800 --> 20:38.605
These vamps have
been here for a while.
They've nested.

20:38.637 --> 20:42.040
So, you're saying
they're a couple
of poofters?

20:42.074 --> 20:46.746
No. I'm saying
they had nothing to do
with last night's murders.

20:46.778 --> 20:50.950
How do you figure?
Whoever did it only arrived
in town last night.

20:52.183 --> 20:54.421
Looks like you've
wasted my time.

20:54.453 --> 20:55.954
(sighs)
Ugh!

21:02.828 --> 21:08.335
What are you doing?
I-- uh, it was--
(scoffs)

21:08.367 --> 21:12.404
I wasn't thinking.
What is this?

21:12.439 --> 21:14.906
Oh, c-- don't get
your knickers twisted!
I was--

21:14.941 --> 21:17.477
What is this?

21:17.509 --> 21:21.980
The late-night stakeout,
the bogus suspects,
the flask.

21:23.316 --> 21:25.284
Is this a date?
A--

21:26.519 --> 21:29.355
Please!
(chuckles)
A date!

21:29.388 --> 21:32.825
You are completely
off your bird.

21:32.858 --> 21:34.626
I mean-- do you
want it to be?

21:36.162 --> 21:39.632
Uhh. Oh, my god.

21:43.234 --> 21:45.971
Oh. Oh, no.

21:47.673 --> 21:50.643
Are you out
of your mind?
It's not so unusual.

21:52.811 --> 21:56.816
Two people...
in the workplace.
Feelings develop.

21:56.848 --> 22:01.354
No! No, no, feelings
do not develop.
No feelings.

22:01.387 --> 22:05.357
You can't deny it.
There's something
between us.

22:05.392 --> 22:09.060
Loathing. Disgust.
Heat. Desire.

22:09.095 --> 22:12.632
Please. Spike,
you're a vampire!
Angel was a vampire.

22:12.664 --> 22:17.836
Angel was good.
And I can be too.
I've changed, Buffy.

22:17.869 --> 22:21.907
What, that chip
in your head?
That's not change.

22:21.941 --> 22:25.678
That's just holding you back.
You're like a serial killer
in prison!

22:25.711 --> 22:28.013
Women marry 'em
all the time!
Uhh!

22:28.047 --> 22:31.317
Uh, but I'm not like that.

22:31.349 --> 22:34.353
Something's happening to me.
I can't stop
thinking about you.

22:34.386 --> 22:37.355
Uhh.
And if that means turning my
back on the whole evil thing--

22:37.390 --> 22:40.992
You don't know what you mean.
You don't know
what feelings are.

22:41.027 --> 22:44.596
I damn well do!
I lie awake every night.

22:44.631 --> 22:48.233
You sleep
during the day!
Yeah, but--

22:48.267 --> 22:52.238
You are missing the point.
This is real here.

22:52.270 --> 22:54.373
I love--
Don't!

22:54.406 --> 22:57.477
(sighs)
Don't say it.

22:59.546 --> 23:03.615
I'm going.
Oh, come on.
We need to talk.

23:03.650 --> 23:06.285
We don't need to
do anything, okay?

23:06.317 --> 23:10.288
There is no we.
Understand?

23:12.791 --> 23:14.093
Buffy.

23:36.615 --> 23:37.983
Who's there?

23:39.184 --> 23:42.153
DRUSILLA:
A happy memory,
pretty Spike.

23:44.957 --> 23:47.425
Look who's come to make
everything right again.

23:58.671 --> 24:01.907
So, uh, let me
get this straight.

24:01.941 --> 24:06.479
Darla got mojoed back
from the beyond.
You vamped her,

24:06.512 --> 24:08.515
and now she and you
are working on
turning Angel

24:08.548 --> 24:11.416
into his own
bad self again.
Mm-hmm.

24:11.450 --> 24:13.653
Sounds fun.
It is.

24:13.685 --> 24:17.155
Like lollipops
at the circus.

24:17.189 --> 24:22.929
Although... didn't care for
Angelus setting us on fire.

24:22.961 --> 24:26.265
And this has got you,
what, all nostalgic
now, has it?

24:26.298 --> 24:28.867
I want us to be a family again,
my William.

24:31.738 --> 24:33.806
(breathy sigh)

24:33.839 --> 24:35.974
(whispers)
Come back with me.

24:38.243 --> 24:40.613
To Los Angeles?

24:40.646 --> 24:43.348
I've done the whole
L.A. scene, Dru.

24:43.382 --> 24:44.916
Didn't agree with me.

24:47.385 --> 24:51.891
Besides, hmm?
I've got a sweet little setup
here in Sunny-d.

24:51.923 --> 24:57.028
Decent digs...
not to mention all
the tasty townies I can eat.

24:57.063 --> 24:59.999
Naughty. Shh.

25:00.031 --> 25:01.733
You needn't
make up stories.

25:02.835 --> 25:05.704
I already know why
you're not coming.

25:05.738 --> 25:08.740
Poor boy.

25:08.775 --> 25:12.510
Tin soldiers put
funny little knickknacks
in your brain.

25:12.545 --> 25:15.446
Can't hunt. Can't hurt.
Can't kill.

25:18.750 --> 25:20.553
You've got a chip.

25:21.587 --> 25:25.057
Right. So you've heard.

25:25.090 --> 25:28.493
Poor Spike's become
a cautionary tale
for vampires, right?

25:28.527 --> 25:31.864
"You better be good, kiddies,
or else they might wire you up
someday."

25:34.032 --> 25:36.702
I don't believe in science.

25:36.736 --> 25:39.305
All those bits and molecules
no one's ever seen.

25:40.372 --> 25:43.742
I trust eyes
and heart alone.

25:43.776 --> 25:48.314
And do you know what
mine is singing out
right now?

25:51.083 --> 25:52.618
(whispers)
You're a killer.

25:53.786 --> 25:58.924
Born to slash
and bash and--
(gasps)

25:58.958 --> 26:04.096
Oh! Bleed like
beautiful poetry.

26:04.130 --> 26:06.633
(panting)

26:06.665 --> 26:10.737
No little tinkertoy could
ever stop you from flowing.

26:10.769 --> 26:13.605
Yeah.
Ohh.

26:18.109 --> 26:21.446
But the pain,
love, you don't understand.

26:21.480 --> 26:26.653
It's-- It's searing.
It's blinding.

26:29.288 --> 26:30.521
All in your head.

26:32.023 --> 26:36.427
I can see it.
Little bit of plastic

26:36.461 --> 26:39.131
spider webbing out
nasty blue shocks,

26:40.266 --> 26:42.801
and every one is a lie.

26:42.835 --> 26:46.505
Electricity lies, Spike.

26:46.538 --> 26:50.375
It tells you
you're not a bad dog,
but you are.

26:52.111 --> 26:55.047
(growls)

26:56.382 --> 26:57.950
HARMONY:
What the heck is this?

26:57.983 --> 27:00.286
Oh, bloody hell.

27:00.318 --> 27:04.355
Who is--
oh, wait. I get it.

27:04.390 --> 27:06.525
Our little
sex game was
just the beginning.

27:06.557 --> 27:09.428
Now you've gone
and picked up some
cheap queen of the damned

27:09.461 --> 27:12.198
to dress up like
your precious "Druidzilla."

27:12.230 --> 27:14.767
Harm--
You better not be thinking
what I think you're thinking,

27:14.800 --> 27:17.869
'cause my answer is
the same as always.

27:17.903 --> 27:22.875
No threesomes unless
it's boy, boy, girl.
Or Charlize Theron.

27:22.909 --> 27:27.179
Harm, you moron,
this is Drusilla.

27:27.212 --> 27:31.349
Oh.
(scoffs)
Well.

27:31.383 --> 27:36.387
You've got some nerve
showing up here like this
after all this time.

27:36.422 --> 27:40.226
After breaking my sweet
boo-boo's heart!
(mouths "boo-boo")

27:40.259 --> 27:42.394
Do you have any idea
how hard it's been

27:42.427 --> 27:44.630
to break down
the walls he put up
after you left?

27:44.663 --> 27:47.799
I mean,
serious trust issues.
Harm--

27:47.834 --> 27:50.001
So it's no use,
you crawling back to him,

27:50.036 --> 27:53.072
'cause Spikey don't
play that game anymore,
morticia.

27:56.607 --> 27:58.544
It's been fun while
it lasted, Harm,

27:58.576 --> 28:02.749
But I think
it'd be best now
if you hit the road.

28:02.781 --> 28:04.182
Uh!

28:05.616 --> 28:08.855
(gasping)

28:08.887 --> 28:12.157
Why?
Because she's back?

28:12.191 --> 28:13.392
No.

28:15.060 --> 28:16.295
Because I am.

28:20.799 --> 28:24.236
Huh!
And there you are,

28:24.269 --> 28:27.506
my darling, deadly boy.

28:27.538 --> 28:29.375
(panting)

28:30.876 --> 28:33.444
Well, he--
he actually told you?

28:33.479 --> 28:35.914
He said,
"I love you"?

28:35.948 --> 28:41.086
Well, I didn't let him
get that far, but I could
see the words coming.

28:41.119 --> 28:46.224
Honey, did you somehow,
unintentionally,
lead him on in any way?

28:46.258 --> 28:49.694
Send him signals?
Well...

28:49.728 --> 28:51.430
I do beat him up a lot.

28:52.898 --> 28:56.734
For Spike, that's
like third base.
Ohh!

28:56.769 --> 28:59.238
Buffy, um, I'm
really worried.

28:59.270 --> 29:02.909
So am I.
He could become dangerous.
Not really.

29:02.942 --> 29:05.310
I mean, as long as
it's still "chips ahoy"
in Spike's head,

29:05.344 --> 29:08.213
He can't hurt me
or any of us.

29:08.247 --> 29:10.916
You know, besides,
this'll probably just
blow over. You know?

29:10.950 --> 29:14.220
It's just some weird
Spike thing.

29:14.252 --> 29:16.555
He'll have the hots
for some gak demon
before we know it.

29:16.587 --> 29:21.626
I don't know.
These things can--
can become pretty twisted.

29:21.660 --> 29:23.796
Yeah, and Spike.
I mean, he's--

29:23.829 --> 29:26.731
Pretty twisted.
Yeah.

29:26.765 --> 29:30.169
Well, you made it clear,
right? That it could
never happen.

29:30.201 --> 29:33.005
That there's no
possible way ever.

29:33.038 --> 29:36.508
Yeah. I-I think so.

29:36.541 --> 29:39.510
I don't know.
I was just so thrown.

29:39.545 --> 29:41.913
Well, Buffy, you have
to talk to him again.

29:41.948 --> 29:44.415
What? No! No, no, no.

29:44.450 --> 29:48.019
I have to avoid him again.
Not until you shut
him down completely.

29:48.054 --> 29:52.825
If he thinks there's even a
little chance with you, there's
no telling what he'll do.

29:54.625 --> 29:58.329
* And this time

29:58.364 --> 30:02.101
* I'm staying

30:02.134 --> 30:04.369
* To bury

30:04.403 --> 30:07.839
* The trail that you left

30:07.874 --> 30:11.176
* You left

30:24.990 --> 30:28.727
* And if I was cold

30:28.759 --> 30:34.532
* Well then you would stay

30:34.566 --> 30:37.202
* Inside me

30:37.236 --> 30:42.508
* Warm me

30:48.279 --> 30:51.482
* Here I'm safe

30:51.517 --> 30:55.054
I know this is hard, honey,
but I think you made
the right decision.

30:55.086 --> 30:57.823
Better to nip this
in the bud before--
The bud nips me?

30:57.855 --> 30:59.758
Exactly.

30:59.790 --> 31:03.429
I mean, if you want, Buffy,
I can go with. Back you up
with some scowlin'.

31:03.461 --> 31:05.897
Thanks, but I think
this is something

31:05.932 --> 31:08.267
I have to do myself.

31:08.299 --> 31:10.368
Besides, you know,
maybe I'm wrong.

31:10.402 --> 31:13.838
Maybe this whole thing's
just been blown
way out of proportion,

31:13.872 --> 31:17.409
and he's already gone back
to wanting me dead.
Here's hopin'.

31:18.443 --> 31:21.712
(sighs)

31:21.747 --> 31:25.550
You know what though?
There is one thing you can
do for me while I'm gone.

31:25.584 --> 31:27.920
* I told you

31:27.953 --> 31:32.557
* Just like I told everyone

31:32.590 --> 31:36.362
* I still have some doubts

31:36.394 --> 31:39.932
* That you are the reason

31:41.267 --> 31:43.902
* Still this is just so hard

31:43.935 --> 31:50.041
* 'Cause I know that
I'll be left like always *

31:50.076 --> 31:52.211
(snarls)

31:52.243 --> 31:55.981
* Always

31:56.015 --> 31:59.817
* Here I'm safe

31:59.851 --> 32:03.654
* So here I stay

32:03.689 --> 32:07.492
* Lift me out

32:07.526 --> 32:11.497
* Lift the doubt

32:16.934 --> 32:18.836
(snarls)

32:34.885 --> 32:36.154
Spike?

32:39.724 --> 32:40.826
Are you here?

32:51.636 --> 32:52.570
Spike?

32:54.640 --> 32:56.208
(sighs)

34:14.052 --> 34:15.786
See anything interesting?

34:18.056 --> 34:20.492
Spike. I--

34:22.128 --> 34:23.994
What-- eh--

34:25.130 --> 34:27.233
What happened?
DRUSILLA:
Me.

34:28.434 --> 34:29.867
Aah!

34:29.900 --> 34:32.438
You remember my ex,
don't you, Slayer?

34:32.471 --> 34:34.273
(groans)

34:34.306 --> 34:37.074
Come back,
she did.

34:37.108 --> 34:39.744
Couldn't live
without me.

34:39.777 --> 34:43.282
My boy's been feeding again.
I know what he
really wants to eat.

34:45.184 --> 34:47.918
Uh!

34:47.952 --> 34:50.822
Shall we tie her up?

34:50.856 --> 34:53.391
Play with her
a teensy bit first.

34:53.425 --> 34:57.295
I'm through playing.
Ooh!

34:57.329 --> 34:59.998
I like it when you're all dour
and straight-to-business-like.

35:05.804 --> 35:07.172
Aah!

35:11.510 --> 35:13.545
Bloody well
through playing.

35:22.887 --> 35:25.523
(moans softly)
SPIKE:
There she is.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.161
I was beginning
to think you'd sleep
the night away.

35:32.664 --> 35:35.501
Dru? Drusilla?

35:39.804 --> 35:43.309
Not nice to change the game
in mid-play, Spike.

35:43.342 --> 35:46.844
You've taken my chair,
and the music
hasn't stopped.

35:46.878 --> 35:49.347
Sorry, pet.
My house, my rules.

35:49.380 --> 35:52.351
I think I should be
very cross with you
when I'm free again.

35:52.384 --> 35:57.188
What's going on?
Simple. I'm gonna
prove something.

36:00.559 --> 36:03.695
I love you.
Oh, my god.

36:03.728 --> 36:05.896
Hey, no. Look at me.
(grunts)

36:05.931 --> 36:09.835
I... love you.
Uh!

36:11.036 --> 36:13.271
You're all I
bloody think about...

36:14.572 --> 36:16.007
dream about.

36:17.509 --> 36:19.577
You're in my gut...

36:19.610 --> 36:21.012
in my throat.

36:23.114 --> 36:25.851
I'm drowning
in you, Summers.
I'm drowning in you.

36:25.884 --> 36:29.355
(laughing)

36:29.387 --> 36:32.190
I can do without
the laugh track, Dru.

36:32.224 --> 36:34.826
But it's so funny.

36:34.860 --> 36:38.364
I knew...
before you did.

36:39.864 --> 36:41.567
I knew you
loved the Slayer.

36:41.599 --> 36:44.503
The pixies in my head
whispered it to me.

36:44.536 --> 36:47.338
You can't tell me that
there isn't anything there
between you and me.

36:47.373 --> 36:51.175
I know you feel something.
It's called revulsion.

36:51.208 --> 36:53.744
And whatever you
think you're feeling,
it's not love.

36:53.778 --> 36:56.047
You can't love
without a soul.

36:56.081 --> 36:58.617
Oh, we can, you know.

36:58.650 --> 37:02.219
We can love quite well...
if not wisely.

37:02.253 --> 37:06.257
You still don't believe.
You still don't think
I mean it.

37:06.291 --> 37:10.762
You want proof, huh?
How's this?

37:19.637 --> 37:23.875
I'm gonna kill
Drusilla for you.
(laughs)

37:23.909 --> 37:27.612
That doesn't prove anything,
except that you're a sick,
miserable vampire

37:27.646 --> 37:29.114
that I should've
dusted a long time ago.

37:29.146 --> 37:32.150
And, hey! Already there.
Don't mock this.

37:32.182 --> 37:36.253
Oh, mock yourself.
This is Drusilla, girl!

37:36.288 --> 37:38.389
Do you have
the slightest idea of
what she means to me?

37:38.423 --> 37:40.925
It's the face
of my salvation.

37:40.958 --> 37:43.961
She delivered me
from mediocrity.

37:43.994 --> 37:48.166
For over a century,
we cut a swath
through continents.

37:48.199 --> 37:50.335
100 years,
she never stopped
surprising me.

37:52.304 --> 37:54.806
Never stopped taking
me to new depths.

37:56.375 --> 37:58.175
I was a lucky bloke...

37:59.777 --> 38:02.112
just to touch such
a black beauty.

38:05.550 --> 38:07.818
Ohh.

38:07.853 --> 38:12.490
Ow!
So you see,
it means something.

38:12.523 --> 38:14.992
Not to me. Kill her.
Why do I care?

38:16.226 --> 38:17.862
Here's why.

38:20.030 --> 38:23.369
If you don't admit that
there's something there,

38:24.735 --> 38:26.704
some tiny feeling for me,

38:26.737 --> 38:31.041
Then I'll untie Dru
and let her kill you instead.

38:31.076 --> 38:35.614
Yes, please.
I like that game much more.

38:35.646 --> 38:37.148
SPIKE: Just...

38:38.717 --> 38:40.985
give me something.

38:41.018 --> 38:44.523
A crumb...
the barest smidgen.

38:46.056 --> 38:50.528
Tell me... maybe...
someday,

38:50.561 --> 38:51.896
there's a chance.

39:03.074 --> 39:04.275
Spike...

39:07.579 --> 39:11.016
the only chance
you had with me was
when I was unconscious.

39:12.684 --> 39:14.219
Oh, wha--

39:15.721 --> 39:17.889
(furious groaning)

39:17.922 --> 39:20.257
(screaming)

39:20.291 --> 39:24.061
What the bleeding hell
is wrong

39:24.094 --> 39:27.065
with you bloody women?

39:27.097 --> 39:29.568
What the hell
does it take?

39:29.601 --> 39:32.771
Why do you bitches
torture me?

39:32.804 --> 39:34.739
Which question do you
want me to answer first?

39:34.773 --> 39:37.175
No, I-I'm at the end
of my bleeding tether,
you know?

39:37.208 --> 39:41.246
I don't know why
I even bother, you know.
It's your fault.

39:41.278 --> 39:44.048
You're the one to blame
for all this, you know.
Am I?

39:44.081 --> 39:48.052
Bloody right you are!
If you hadn't left me
for that chaos demon,

39:48.085 --> 39:50.121
I never would've
come back here!

39:50.155 --> 39:52.858
Never would've had
this sodding chip
in my skull.

39:52.891 --> 39:55.427
And you wouldn't be able
to touch me,

39:55.460 --> 39:58.563
because this,
with you, is wrong.

39:58.597 --> 40:03.201
I know it.
I'm not a complete idiot.

40:03.233 --> 40:05.771
You think I like
having you in here?

40:05.804 --> 40:09.440
Destroying everything that
was me until all that's left
is you in a dead shell.

40:09.474 --> 40:12.978
(scoffs)
You say you hate it,
but you won't leave.

40:13.010 --> 40:16.246
You know what I
should just do is get
rid of both of you.

40:16.280 --> 40:19.150
Burn you!
Cut you into little pieces

40:19.184 --> 40:21.318
so there won't be
any more bints to cock up
things for spi--

40:24.989 --> 40:27.391
Oh, great.

40:27.425 --> 40:30.628
What about me, Spike?
You forget
about me again?

40:30.661 --> 40:33.097
The actu girlfriend?

40:33.130 --> 40:39.103
I gave you the best...
bunch of months
of my life!

40:39.137 --> 40:41.672
Uh!
That's right, little girl.

40:41.706 --> 40:46.777
Teach our naughty boy
a lesson.
Oh, now you're all ganging up.

40:46.811 --> 40:49.079
HARMONY:
I thought I could
change you, Spike.

40:49.114 --> 40:52.416
I thought maybe if I gave
and I gave and gave,

40:52.449 --> 40:55.420
maybe you'd come around.

40:55.452 --> 40:57.655
Maybe be a little nicer.

40:57.688 --> 41:00.525
Stop treating me
like your dog.

41:00.559 --> 41:03.094
But now I see it's you.

41:03.128 --> 41:06.364
You're the dog...
who needs to be put--

41:07.833 --> 41:09.967
(grunting, groaning)

41:31.722 --> 41:33.925
Ow! You're on my hair!

41:35.092 --> 41:36.161
Aah!

41:49.206 --> 41:50.942
(grunting)

42:03.755 --> 42:06.356
(groaning, coughing)

42:10.628 --> 42:11.896
Poor Spike.

42:13.197 --> 42:16.735
So lost.
Even I can't help you now.

42:22.072 --> 42:23.440
Oh, Spikey!

42:24.943 --> 42:27.545
And you can say
good-bye to this,

42:27.579 --> 42:31.548
because you're not
gonna see it anymore.

42:31.583 --> 42:35.887
Unless you run into me
somewhere and it's me
walking away from you.

42:37.088 --> 42:40.391
But even then,
I'll probably just,

42:40.425 --> 42:42.893
you know, back away.

42:49.934 --> 42:50.969
Yow!

43:01.813 --> 43:05.983
Buffy! Come on, now. Stop!
You can't just walk
away from this.

43:06.016 --> 43:08.853
What part of punching you in
the face did you not understand?
So we had a fight.

43:08.954 --> 43:10.789
It's not our first,
love. It doesn't
change anything.

43:10.822 --> 43:14.659
It changes everything, Spike!
I want you out!

43:14.693 --> 43:17.929
I want you out of this town.
I want you off this planet!

43:17.963 --> 43:21.331
You don't come near me,
my friends, or my family
again, ever!

43:21.365 --> 43:25.903
Understand?
No. It's not that easy.

43:25.936 --> 43:28.907
We have something, Buffy.
It's not pretty,
but it's real.

43:28.940 --> 43:30.775
And there's nothing
either one of us
can do about it.

43:30.809 --> 43:32.844
Like it or not,
I'm in your life.
You can't just shut me out.

44:22.092 --> 44:23.661
Grr! Arrgh!
