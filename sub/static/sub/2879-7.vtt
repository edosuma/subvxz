00:02.577 --> 00:04.995
Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

00:04.997 --> 00:08.765
Welcome to Sheldon Cooper
Presents: Fun with Flags.

00:10.335 --> 00:13.203
Before we get started,
I'd like to announce

00:13.205 --> 00:16.106
the winner of our design
your own flag competition.

00:16.108 --> 00:18.275
But I can't.

00:18.277 --> 00:20.944
The only entry
was from GameyGamer75,

00:20.946 --> 00:24.882
and I know that was a jpeg
of your buttocks.

00:24.884 --> 00:27.251
Now this week we have
a very special episode

00:27.253 --> 00:28.919
where we explore the flags

00:28.921 --> 00:32.222
of the popular entertainment
franchise, <i>Star Trek.</i>

00:32.223 --> 00:34.491
And to help me,
I'm pleased to introduce

00:34.493 --> 00:36.326
Internet personality,

00:36.328 --> 00:39.029
former star of <i>Star Trek:</i>
<i>The Next Generation,</i>

00:39.031 --> 00:42.533
and the only guy I know lucky
enough to be immortalized

00:42.535 --> 00:47.638
in 1/16 scale--
set phasers to "fun"...

00:49.874 --> 00:52.309
...for my friend, Wil Wheaton.

00:53.945 --> 00:55.679
Hi, Sheldon.
Thanks for having me.

00:55.681 --> 00:57.080
I'm happy to be here.

00:57.082 --> 00:58.599
Cut.

00:58.601 --> 00:59.700
What's wrong?

00:59.702 --> 01:01.969
Sorry, Sheldon, you were
brilliant as always.

01:01.971 --> 01:04.754
Wil, that was
a little wooden.

01:04.757 --> 01:07.307
Wooden?

01:07.309 --> 01:08.642
Don't worry,
it wasn't terrible.

01:08.644 --> 01:12.479
Just, this time, try to say it
the way people sound.

01:14.482 --> 01:15.816
And action.

01:15.818 --> 01:18.151
My friend, Wil Wheaton.

01:18.153 --> 01:19.820
Hi, Sheldon.
Thanks for having me.

01:19.822 --> 01:21.054
I'm excited to be here.

01:21.056 --> 01:23.740
So, Wil, what do you
have for us first?

01:23.742 --> 01:25.659
Well, this is
an exciting one.

01:25.661 --> 01:28.095
This is the flag of the
United Federation of Planets.

01:28.097 --> 01:30.063
Now what's interesting about this flag...
Cut.

01:31.332 --> 01:32.749
What was wrong with that?

01:32.751 --> 01:35.335
It's called "Fun with Flags."

01:35.337 --> 01:37.671
They're not at half-mast,
nobody died.

01:37.673 --> 01:39.840
Let's try and keep it upbeat.

01:40.725 --> 01:42.125
Um, no offense,

01:42.127 --> 01:43.894
but I've been acting
since I was a kid.

01:43.896 --> 01:45.596
I think I can
handle a Web show

01:45.598 --> 01:46.847
without a lot
of direction.

01:46.849 --> 01:48.098
SHELDON:
It's true.

01:48.100 --> 01:49.633
In 1982, Wil
played the voice

01:49.635 --> 01:52.302
of Martin the mouse
in <i>The Secret of NIMH.</i>

01:52.304 --> 01:54.438
You moved me.

01:55.657 --> 01:56.990
You'll have to forgive me.

01:56.992 --> 02:00.077
This is my first time directing,
I just want it to be good.

02:00.079 --> 02:01.478
So do I.

02:01.480 --> 02:03.363
Great. So, this time let's try

02:03.365 --> 02:05.165
more real boy, less Pinocchio.

02:06.868 --> 02:07.918
And action.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.303
And cut.

02:10.288 --> 02:12.422
You realize that I'm doing this
for free, right?

02:12.424 --> 02:16.510
Yes. And so far, we're still
not getting our money's worth.

02:18.829 --> 02:21.298
Let's try it again.

02:21.300 --> 02:23.166
Everybody's having fun.

02:23.168 --> 02:25.135
And action.

02:25.137 --> 02:27.337
So, Wil...

02:34.779 --> 02:37.080
...what do you have
for us first?

02:37.082 --> 02:41.318
Well, this is
an <i>exciting</i> one.

02:41.320 --> 02:42.886
This is the flag

02:42.888 --> 02:44.888
of the United
Federation of Planets.

02:44.890 --> 02:46.156
Cut.

02:46.158 --> 02:48.959
Problem,
first-time director?

02:48.961 --> 02:50.210
SHELDON:
Oh, none that I could see.

02:50.212 --> 02:53.664
I saw a man who loved flags
almost as much as I do.

02:53.666 --> 02:56.166
I got goose bumps.

02:56.168 --> 02:58.368
He was overacting on purpose.

02:58.370 --> 02:59.469
Really?

02:59.471 --> 03:02.089
He reminded me of a
young William Shatner.

03:02.091 --> 03:03.473
Listen, Sheldon,
I'm really happy

03:03.475 --> 03:05.976
to do this for you,
but not if she's gonna be

03:05.978 --> 03:08.045
a huge pain in the ass
the whole time.

03:08.963 --> 03:11.098
You gonna let him
speak to me like that?

03:11.100 --> 03:15.235
Well...

03:15.237 --> 03:16.720
you're my girlfriend

03:16.722 --> 03:18.655
and I don't want
you to be upset.

03:18.657 --> 03:20.323
Then again,
Wil Wheaton's my friend

03:20.325 --> 03:22.576
and I don't want
him to be upset.

03:22.578 --> 03:24.745
Hmm...

03:24.747 --> 03:26.396
This is a sticky wicket.

03:27.498 --> 03:29.282
What do you think?

03:29.284 --> 03:31.702
Can I speak to you
for a second?

03:31.704 --> 03:34.037
I'll be right back.

03:34.039 --> 03:36.423
Feel free to play
with yourself.

03:43.014 --> 03:46.249
I don't care for your friend,
he's being rude to me.

03:46.251 --> 03:47.684
You need to ask him to leave.

03:47.686 --> 03:50.754
Amy, I can't just ask
Wil Wheaton to leave.

03:50.756 --> 03:52.689
He's a minor celebrity.

03:53.825 --> 03:57.427
Once you explain who he is,
many people recognize him.

03:57.429 --> 03:59.279
Fine. Then maybe I should go.

03:59.281 --> 04:01.865
Could you?
That would solve everything.

04:03.084 --> 04:05.535
You are the <i>best.</i>

04:05.537 --> 04:07.370
I'll see you at dinner tonight?

04:07.372 --> 04:09.039
You sure you wouldn't rather
have dinner

04:09.041 --> 04:10.240
with your friend Wil Wheaton?

04:10.242 --> 04:12.793
Come to think of it, I would!

04:13.628 --> 04:16.446

04:46.913 --> 04:48.182
Every time we eat
dinner here,

04:48.183 --> 04:50.266
your mother refuses to let me
help with the dishes.

04:50.268 --> 04:52.969
Don't take it personally.
She likes doing them by herself

04:52.971 --> 04:55.888
so she can lick the plates
with no one looking.

04:55.890 --> 04:57.723
You ready to go?

04:57.725 --> 05:01.444
Yeah, let me just grab a couple
of fresh turtlenecks.

05:01.446 --> 05:03.780
I don't understand
why you keep your stuff here

05:03.782 --> 05:05.598
when there's plenty
of room at home.

05:05.600 --> 05:07.333
What are you
talking about?

05:07.335 --> 05:10.169
All I have here
is a few sweaters,

05:10.171 --> 05:12.989
books, bank stuff,
computers,

05:12.991 --> 05:15.458
mail, collectibles, medicine
and my electric body groomer.

05:16.627 --> 05:19.579
Ooh, there's my plaid dickie.

05:19.581 --> 05:22.748
Oh, got this at the Goodwill
store for 50 cents.

05:22.750 --> 05:25.201
Can you believe it?

05:26.203 --> 05:29.055
50 cents sounds right.

05:30.540 --> 05:31.724
Let's go.

05:31.726 --> 05:32.892
You know, it's kinda late.

05:32.894 --> 05:34.543
Why don't we just spend
the night here?

05:34.545 --> 05:36.179
Because we don't live here.

05:36.181 --> 05:37.379
I know.

05:37.381 --> 05:39.348
Do you? You said when you got
back from space

05:39.350 --> 05:40.983
you were gonna move into
my apartment,

05:40.985 --> 05:42.602
but half the time we stay here.

05:42.604 --> 05:45.071
That's not true.

05:45.073 --> 05:47.156
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Howard, I'm doing laundry!

05:47.158 --> 05:49.492
You want me to put
anything in for you?!

05:49.494 --> 05:52.829
There's some underwear
in the hamper!

05:52.831 --> 05:56.249
Oh, good! I got that new
stain stick to try out!

05:58.669 --> 06:03.723
Thank you! I only put it
on the list two weeks ago!

06:03.725 --> 06:05.858
Okay, I see what
you're getting at.

06:06.760 --> 06:08.878
How about this weekend

06:08.880 --> 06:13.850
I'll box up all my things
and move them to our place.

06:13.852 --> 06:15.268
Thank you.

06:15.270 --> 06:17.937
The lightsabers are gonna
look great in the living room.

06:17.939 --> 06:21.090
Or in the closet.
We can decide later.

06:21.092 --> 06:23.359
Howard, help!

06:23.361 --> 06:26.112
My hand's stuck
in the garbage disposal!

06:26.114 --> 06:30.283
Let go of whatever piece of food
you're holding!

06:30.285 --> 06:31.951
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Are you kidding?!

06:31.953 --> 06:35.388
It's a perfectly good
chicken leg!

06:38.375 --> 06:40.626
Hey, look who's out
after dark, like a big boy.

06:40.628 --> 06:44.380
I was out raising heck
with Mr. Wil Wheaton.

06:44.382 --> 06:45.998
Four hours more
and we would have

06:46.000 --> 06:49.051
closed down the
HomeTown Buffet.

06:49.053 --> 06:50.586
I thought you had plans
with Amy.

06:50.588 --> 06:55.007
Yeah, I did, but then Wil called
Amy a pain in the A-S-S.

06:55.009 --> 06:56.893
She got huffy and left,

06:56.895 --> 06:59.145
then Wil and I headed out
to dinner.

06:59.147 --> 07:02.265
That place really did remind me
of my hometown.

07:02.267 --> 07:06.085
Because there we also have
a HomeTown Buffet.

07:08.121 --> 07:10.356
Hold on.
Wil and Amy had an argument?

07:10.358 --> 07:12.491
Yes, quite the kerfuffle.

07:12.493 --> 07:14.827
Then Amy got mad and left?

07:14.829 --> 07:16.495
Walked right out the door.

07:16.497 --> 07:18.531
And you...?

07:18.533 --> 07:21.183
Enjoyed a delightful dinner
at a reasonable price.

07:22.119 --> 07:24.153
The manager recognized Wil

07:24.155 --> 07:27.206
and let us sit right next
to the frozen yogurt machine.

07:27.208 --> 07:28.474
Right next to it!

07:29.493 --> 07:32.812
I was closer to it than
I am to you right now.

07:32.814 --> 07:35.932
Buddy, I think Amy
might be upset.

07:35.934 --> 07:37.683
Why's that?

07:37.685 --> 07:39.668
Because your friend
was rude to her,

07:39.670 --> 07:41.470
and then you went
to dinner with him.

07:41.472 --> 07:44.640
You're just repeating
what I said.

07:44.642 --> 07:46.976
It's like living with
a lactose-intolerant parrot.

07:48.795 --> 07:51.781
Trust me, call her.

07:51.783 --> 07:55.952
Fine. It's a shame you didn't
go to dinner with us,

07:55.954 --> 07:57.536
because the buffet
you're about to enjoy

07:57.538 --> 07:59.288
only serves humble pie,

07:59.290 --> 08:02.241
a dessert much less tasty
than frozen yogurt.

08:02.243 --> 08:03.626
I was this close.

08:03.628 --> 08:06.912
(Skype ringing)

08:06.914 --> 08:09.649
What?

08:09.651 --> 08:11.150
You'll appreciate this.

08:11.152 --> 08:13.719
Leonard has some ridiculous
notion that you're mad at me.

08:13.721 --> 08:15.504
Tell him you're
not mad at me.

08:15.506 --> 08:16.922
Go ahead, set
him straight.

08:16.924 --> 08:18.491
I'm mad at you, Sheldon.

08:18.493 --> 08:23.012
Hmm. Eat one of
your Luna bars.

08:24.481 --> 08:26.449
Very often when women
think they're angry,

08:26.451 --> 08:28.818
they're really just hungry.

08:28.820 --> 08:31.370
I'm not hungry.

08:32.438 --> 08:34.373
Your friend insulted me,
and you didn't do anything.

08:34.375 --> 08:39.111
Precisely, I didn't
do anything.

08:39.113 --> 08:42.231
Now does someone feel like
checking her emotional math?

08:42.232 --> 08:45.451
Keep going, buddy,
you're doing great.

08:45.453 --> 08:47.036
Sheldon, I'm your girlfriend,

08:47.038 --> 08:48.921
and you should have
taken my side.

08:48.923 --> 08:52.425
That's it. End of story.
Good night.

08:53.360 --> 08:58.097
Wow, Amy's mad
and Leonard was right.

08:58.099 --> 09:00.800
What a weird day.

09:03.053 --> 09:04.753
Hey. Sorry this took so long.

09:04.755 --> 09:07.390
But you used to work here,
you know how it is.

09:07.392 --> 09:09.058
Kitchen slammed again?

09:09.060 --> 09:11.811
No, I'm a terrible waitress,
remember?

09:13.113 --> 09:14.263
So, is there anything I can do

09:14.265 --> 09:15.597
to help you with the move
tomorrow?

09:15.599 --> 09:16.866
Now that you mention it,

09:16.868 --> 09:19.985
I was thinking tomorrow
might not be great.

09:19.987 --> 09:22.238
What's your excuse this time?

09:22.240 --> 09:25.958
No excuse. It's just, you know,
I'm Jewish, and technically,

09:25.960 --> 09:28.494
we're not supposed to drive or
carry anything on the Sabbath.

09:28.496 --> 09:31.881
So this one's on God.

09:31.883 --> 09:33.282
That might be
a little more convincing

09:33.284 --> 09:36.268
if you didn't have a mouthful
of bacon cheeseburger.

09:36.270 --> 09:39.455
My religion's kinda
loosey-goosey.

09:39.457 --> 09:41.640
Basically, as long as you got
your schmekel clipped

09:41.642 --> 09:43.743
and don't wear a cross,
you're good.

09:46.480 --> 09:47.596
Howie, you promised you'd move.

09:47.598 --> 09:48.848
And I will.

09:48.850 --> 09:50.182
Yeah, right.

09:50.184 --> 09:52.651
I will. I'm obviously not going
to live in my mother's house

09:52.653 --> 09:55.321
for the rest of my life.
I'm not a child.

09:55.323 --> 09:58.624
I've seen her burp you.

10:00.160 --> 10:02.061
She did not burp me.

10:02.063 --> 10:05.631
She was patting me on the back,
and I happened to burp.

10:07.650 --> 10:10.319
Don't you have other tables
you should be waiting on?

10:10.321 --> 10:13.422
Yeah, but I told you,
I'm not good at my job.

10:13.424 --> 10:14.507
Bernadette,
listen to me.

10:14.509 --> 10:15.624
He is never gonna leave.

10:15.626 --> 10:17.626
I'm starting to think
you're right.

10:17.628 --> 10:19.295
All right,
I've had enough of this.

10:19.297 --> 10:21.881
I'm a grown man,
I have a successful career.

10:21.883 --> 10:24.433
For the love of God,
I've been to space!

10:24.435 --> 10:26.051
I will move out when I'm ready,

10:26.053 --> 10:28.387
and I don't need anyone
badgering me into it!

10:28.389 --> 10:32.007
Wow, excuse me.

10:32.842 --> 10:34.510
That was just for her benefit.

10:34.512 --> 10:36.479
I'll move tomorrow. I love you.
Don't leave me.

10:41.318 --> 10:43.185
Amy.

10:43.187 --> 10:45.187
Amy.

10:45.189 --> 10:47.573
Angry Amy.

10:47.575 --> 10:49.792
What?

10:49.794 --> 10:52.244
I've been thinking about
what happened,

10:52.246 --> 10:54.497
and I hope this gift

10:54.499 --> 10:56.582
will make things better.

10:58.385 --> 11:01.637
<i>Star Trek</i> DVDs?

11:01.639 --> 11:02.888
Why would I want this?

11:02.890 --> 11:05.090
First of all, you're welcome.

11:06.092 --> 11:08.043
Furthermore, not being familiar

11:08.045 --> 11:09.478
with Wil Wheaton's body of work,

11:09.480 --> 11:11.063
there was no way for you to know

11:11.065 --> 11:12.932
you were being rude
to a national treasure.

11:14.267 --> 11:17.703
Get ready for 130 hours
of "I told you so."

11:21.174 --> 11:22.741
Fine.

11:22.743 --> 11:25.394
I'll just tell you what happens.

11:25.396 --> 11:28.397
Episode one,
"Encounter at Farpoint."

11:28.399 --> 11:29.698
Fade in.

11:29.700 --> 11:32.585
The new <i>Enterprise</i> heads out
on its maiden voyage

11:32.587 --> 11:35.287
to contact the Bandi people
of Deneb IV.

11:35.289 --> 11:38.374
Enter Wesley Crusher,
played by my buddy...

11:42.963 --> 11:45.181
She's hooked.

11:47.000 --> 11:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:56.909 --> 11:57.943
Wow.

11:57.944 --> 11:59.693
An end of an era.

11:59.695 --> 12:00.861
(sighs)

12:00.863 --> 12:04.715
Boy, if these walls could talk.

12:04.717 --> 12:08.336
They'd say, "Why does he
touch himself so much?"

12:12.925 --> 12:14.642
Yeah.

12:16.979 --> 12:20.248
I can't believe I'm not going
to live here anymore.

12:20.250 --> 12:23.601
This has always been my bedroom.

12:23.603 --> 12:27.021
Right here is where my mom
used to mark my height.

12:27.023 --> 12:28.722
Oh, yeah.

12:28.724 --> 12:30.141
Fifth grade.

12:30.143 --> 12:31.576
Sixth grade.

12:31.578 --> 12:32.860
Seventh grade.

12:32.862 --> 12:33.995
Eighth grade.

12:33.997 --> 12:36.330
Ninth grade.

12:37.299 --> 12:39.534
I remember when I was five,

12:39.536 --> 12:43.538
hiding under this desk
with all my Halloween candy.

12:43.540 --> 12:44.905
Had some Peanut M&M'S,

12:44.907 --> 12:48.092
went into my first
anaphylactic shock

12:48.094 --> 12:51.796
and had to be rushed
to the hospital.

12:51.798 --> 12:53.798
Came home,
celebrated with a Snickers,

12:53.800 --> 12:55.716
went into my second
anaphylactic shock.

12:56.835 --> 12:59.887
When did you figure out
you were allergic to nuts?

12:59.889 --> 13:02.056
Sometime
around the third Almond Joy.

13:03.058 --> 13:04.425
Okay.

13:04.427 --> 13:06.561
You want to start loading
this stuff into the truck?

13:06.563 --> 13:08.262
Yeah, I guess.

13:08.264 --> 13:10.498
Hey, would you do me a favor?

13:10.500 --> 13:11.732
Go on ahead.

13:11.734 --> 13:16.270
I just want one last moment
alone in my old room.

13:16.272 --> 13:18.289
We're not standing outside
by the U-Haul

13:18.291 --> 13:20.458
while you fondle yourself.

13:20.460 --> 13:22.627
(scoffs)

13:22.629 --> 13:24.545
Fine, let's go.

13:31.053 --> 13:32.336
Hey.

13:32.338 --> 13:33.921
What brings you in?

13:33.923 --> 13:35.640
Penny, if you wouldn't mind,

13:35.642 --> 13:39.644
I'd like to have a conversation
about girls.

13:39.646 --> 13:43.197
I had a feeling we'd have a
talk like this sooner or later.

13:44.283 --> 13:48.302
Are you finally getting
fuzz in weird places?

13:48.304 --> 13:49.803
Penny, please,

13:49.805 --> 13:52.006
I'm on the horns
of a relationship dilemma.

13:52.008 --> 13:54.325
And for the record,
I had a full pubis of hair

13:54.327 --> 13:56.944
by the time I was 19.

13:56.946 --> 13:59.163
And for the record...

13:59.165 --> 14:01.382
(vomiting noises)

14:02.401 --> 14:03.784
So what are you drinking?

14:03.786 --> 14:05.536
Well, it's been a rough day.

14:05.538 --> 14:06.987
I usually go chamomile tea,

14:06.989 --> 14:08.856
but I don't think
that's going to cut it.

14:08.858 --> 14:12.076
You could have a
Long Island Iced Tea.

14:14.896 --> 14:18.366
Will that calm my nerves?

14:18.368 --> 14:21.969
It's calmed the pants
off me a couple of times.

14:21.971 --> 14:23.621
Sold.

14:23.623 --> 14:26.474
Oh.

14:26.476 --> 14:29.877
So, the heart you got from
the wizard giving you trouble?

14:29.879 --> 14:31.845
The trouble isn't with me,
Penny,

14:31.847 --> 14:33.364
it's with your gender.

14:33.366 --> 14:34.782
Someday,
scientists will discover

14:34.784 --> 14:36.784
that second X chromosome
contains nothing

14:36.786 --> 14:39.503
but nonsense and twaddle.

14:39.505 --> 14:41.656
Yeah, Amy told me what happened.

14:41.658 --> 14:43.040
Look, just apologize.

14:43.042 --> 14:44.659
It'll warm her twaddle.

14:44.661 --> 14:46.160
(groans)

14:46.162 --> 14:47.878
It's a Band-Aid at best.

14:47.880 --> 14:51.582
The core problem is that Amy
and Wil do not like each other.

14:51.584 --> 14:55.336
Which is baffling because
they're both crazy about me.

14:56.488 --> 14:57.705
And I like them,

14:57.707 --> 14:59.840
which indicates
they're bright and interesting

14:59.842 --> 15:02.426
and/or were on <i>Star Trek.</i>

15:02.428 --> 15:05.546
Honey, you can't make
people like each other.

15:05.548 --> 15:06.897
Not true.

15:06.899 --> 15:08.599
Leonard made me like you.

15:08.601 --> 15:11.569
And let me tell you,
that was a hard row to hoe.

15:12.821 --> 15:15.022
Cheers, pal.

15:16.692 --> 15:18.225
Ooh.

15:18.227 --> 15:22.079
Boy, that is a treat
that's hard to beat.

15:23.348 --> 15:26.567
Get the Mad Hatter on the horn,
I'm having a tea party.

15:32.090 --> 15:33.841
You might want to pace yourself.

15:33.843 --> 15:35.876
I drink tea all the time.

15:35.878 --> 15:38.546
I think I know what I'm doing.

15:38.548 --> 15:42.383
Far be it from me to criticize
a man with a full pubis.

15:43.952 --> 15:46.754
Look, Sheldon, your problem
is not Wil Wheaton, okay?

15:46.756 --> 15:48.539
Your problem is the way
you treated Amy.

15:48.541 --> 15:51.776
(slurps)
My problem is I'm out of tea.

15:53.094 --> 15:54.779
Come on, someone insulted

15:54.781 --> 15:56.731
your girlfriend and
you just let him do it.

15:56.733 --> 15:59.283
I thought you Texas guys
stood up for your womenfolk.

15:59.285 --> 16:01.202
Penny, please,

16:01.204 --> 16:04.388
I think I've evolved beyond
my simple rustic upbringing.

16:04.390 --> 16:06.106
Sorry.

16:06.108 --> 16:09.343
On the other hand, that low-down
polecat done wronged my woman.

16:12.748 --> 16:14.915
Welcome to Long Island, Tex.

16:16.551 --> 16:18.669
Amy deserves better.

16:18.671 --> 16:21.338
You know, when we buy
the Planter's deluxe mix,

16:21.340 --> 16:24.892
she eats all the Brazil nuts
so I don't have to look at them.

16:26.094 --> 16:29.830
She's a unique blend
of saint and squirrel.

16:29.832 --> 16:31.632
Yeah, that she is.

16:31.634 --> 16:32.616
Here you go.

16:32.618 --> 16:34.518
I'm a callous egomaniac.

16:34.520 --> 16:36.303
She's gonna leave me.

16:36.305 --> 16:37.421
No, she won't.

16:37.423 --> 16:39.640
No, she won't. I'm great.

16:46.981 --> 16:49.517
(exhales)

16:50.702 --> 16:52.953
Okay, I have now

16:52.955 --> 16:55.506
officially moved
out of my mother's house.

16:55.508 --> 16:57.541
You are now the only woman
in my life

16:57.543 --> 16:59.810
who I'll see naked
in the bathroom.

16:59.812 --> 17:02.129
I know this wasn't easy.

17:02.131 --> 17:03.414
You doing okay?

17:03.416 --> 17:04.998
Oh, I'm fine.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.851
It's just her I'm worried about.

17:06.853 --> 17:08.636
Aw, she'll be okay.

17:08.637 --> 17:10.588
She's a grown woman.
I know.

17:10.589 --> 17:12.673
It's just
ever since my dad left,

17:12.675 --> 17:15.142
I've felt responsible for her.

17:15.144 --> 17:17.728
That's a lot for a
kid to deal with.

17:17.730 --> 17:20.830
She was just so sad
all the time.

17:20.833 --> 17:24.068
Yeah, I was the only person
who could cheer her up.

17:24.069 --> 17:26.470
Well, me and Ben and Jerry.

17:26.472 --> 17:30.124
She's lucky you were there.

17:31.910 --> 17:34.962
You know, she's why
I first got into magic.

17:34.964 --> 17:36.714
I would do little shows
for her,

17:36.716 --> 17:40.417
hang up a bedsheet
like it was a curtain,

17:40.419 --> 17:42.753
put on a top hat and cape.

17:42.755 --> 17:44.171
And part way through the act,

17:44.173 --> 17:47.925
I would say I needed a volunteer
from the audience

17:47.927 --> 17:50.711
to be my beautiful assistant

17:50.713 --> 17:53.481
and invite her up on stage.

17:53.483 --> 17:57.217
I can still remember
the way she'd smile.

17:57.219 --> 17:59.904
For a few minutes,
she'd...

17:59.906 --> 18:02.773
forget how lonely she was.

18:02.775 --> 18:04.408
(sighs)

18:04.410 --> 18:06.327
Aw, crap.

18:06.329 --> 18:08.045
Let's go.

18:08.047 --> 18:10.230
Where we going?

18:10.232 --> 18:11.499
Grab a box.

18:11.501 --> 18:13.334
We'll sleep
at your mother's place tonight.

18:13.336 --> 18:15.186
No, but I want to live here.

18:15.188 --> 18:16.570
Well, you should've
thought of that

18:16.572 --> 18:19.423
before you told me
the stupid magic trick story.

18:19.425 --> 18:21.926
Can't we talk about this?

18:21.928 --> 18:25.546
No husband of mine is gonna
break his mother's heart!

18:33.221 --> 18:34.922
Wil Wheaton!

18:34.924 --> 18:37.925
Wil Wheaton!

18:37.927 --> 18:40.077
Wait, how many was that?

18:42.447 --> 18:43.898
Hey, Sheldon, what's up?

18:43.900 --> 18:47.651
Wouldn't you like to know?

18:47.653 --> 18:49.119
Have you been drinking?

18:49.121 --> 18:51.906
Just tea.

18:51.908 --> 18:55.809
The best tea I've ever had.

18:55.811 --> 18:57.795
Why are you here?

18:57.797 --> 18:59.580
I'll tell you.

18:59.582 --> 19:01.582
I'm from Texas.

19:01.584 --> 19:05.286
Need I say more?

19:05.288 --> 19:09.073
Yeah, actually, a little more
would be helpful.

19:09.075 --> 19:10.808
You insulted my woman.

19:10.810 --> 19:13.227
I'm here to defend her honor.

19:13.229 --> 19:15.462
Two! It was two.

19:15.464 --> 19:18.315
Wil Wheaton!

19:19.951 --> 19:22.486
Now prepare yourself

19:22.488 --> 19:25.656
for what may come.

19:25.658 --> 19:29.159
Oh, Sheldon, do you really
think we're gonna fight?

19:29.161 --> 19:30.911
My fists are not up here

19:30.913 --> 19:34.782
because I'm milking a
giant invisible cow.

19:35.750 --> 19:39.036
They're up to beat an
apology out of you.

19:39.038 --> 19:41.188
Okay, I'm sorry.

19:41.190 --> 19:44.959
Well, that was a long bus
ride for not very much.

19:44.961 --> 19:47.127
Are you okay?

19:47.129 --> 19:49.162
You're asking a lot of
questions, Wil Wheaton.

19:49.164 --> 19:51.765
As a matter of
idle curiosity,

19:51.767 --> 19:54.385
which of your
shrubberies do you feel

19:54.387 --> 19:56.604
would benefit from
a thorough vomiting?

19:56.606 --> 19:58.639
Never mind, I'll choose.

20:00.859 --> 20:03.060
(vomiting)

20:05.013 --> 20:07.564
You were so good in <i>Stand by Me.</i>

20:07.566 --> 20:09.767
(vomiting)

20:17.515 --> 20:20.517
Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

20:20.519 --> 20:24.221
Welcome to Sheldon Cooper
Presents: Fun with Flags.

20:25.790 --> 20:27.791
Get ready
for a very special episode

20:27.793 --> 20:29.426
where we explore the flags

20:29.428 --> 20:30.994
of the popular
entertainment franchise,

20:30.996 --> 20:31.975
<i>Star Trek.</i>

20:31.976 --> 20:35.010
And to help us, I'm pleased
to introduce a special guest--

20:35.012 --> 20:37.112
surprisingly,
it only took gas money

20:37.114 --> 20:39.315
and the promise of free food
to get him here--

20:39.317 --> 20:41.650
Mr. LeVar Burton.

20:43.453 --> 20:45.354
Hey, Sheldon,
it's a pleasure to be here.

20:45.356 --> 20:47.773
Well, we've got some interesting flags for...
AMY: Cut!

20:50.226 --> 20:53.462
Yikes, this guy is worse
than Wil Wheaton.

20:55.815 --> 20:58.100
I don't know what
she's talking about,

20:58.102 --> 21:00.202
but I'm obligated
to agree with her.

21:00.204 --> 21:01.370
She's my girlfriend.

21:01.372 --> 21:03.205
Ah, I hear you, brother.

21:03.707 --> 21:06.541
I still get lunch, right?
