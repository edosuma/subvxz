NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system

00:03.337 --> 00:06.174
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:06.207 --> 00:08.442
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.476 --> 00:10.311
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.344 --> 00:12.046
are members of an elite squad

00:12.080 --> 00:13.647
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.316
These are their stories.

00:17.185 --> 00:18.186
I know it's your turn,

00:18.219 --> 00:20.354
but Eric can't spend this
weekend with you...

00:20.388 --> 00:23.157
Adam, breakfast is ready!

00:23.191 --> 00:24.625
Why can't I see
Dad this weekend?

00:24.658 --> 00:25.726
Hold on, Steve...

00:25.759 --> 00:27.495
Because it's Grandma's
birthday

00:27.528 --> 00:28.296
and I promised
we'd go out with her.

00:28.329 --> 00:29.297
Come on, Mom.

00:29.330 --> 00:30.631
Don't argue
with me, Eric.

00:30.664 --> 00:32.533
Just go get him,
or we'll all be late.

00:33.601 --> 00:35.203
Move it, shrimp,
let's go...

00:35.236 --> 00:38.506
Please, Steve, I never
ask you to switch.

00:38.539 --> 00:39.673
I'll owe you one...

00:39.707 --> 00:41.209
Mom, come up here! Hurry!

00:41.242 --> 00:42.276
Thanks, Steve.

00:42.310 --> 00:44.378
I got to go.
What's wrong?

00:44.412 --> 00:45.513
Adam's gone!

00:45.546 --> 00:48.249
What do you mean gone?

00:48.282 --> 00:50.618
Look...

00:55.523 --> 00:57.525
Oh, God, no.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.530
I tucked Adam in at 8:30,

01:02.563 --> 01:05.566
checked on him at 11:00
before I went to bed.

01:05.599 --> 01:06.800
He was sound asleep.

01:06.834 --> 01:07.601
Was the window locked?

01:07.635 --> 01:09.537
I always leave it
open a crack--

01:09.570 --> 01:12.440
Adam likes to be cool.

01:12.473 --> 01:14.475
Look, my bastard
ex-husband did this.

01:14.508 --> 01:16.777
Why would he climb up
the fire escape?

01:16.810 --> 01:18.546
He would do anything.

01:18.579 --> 01:21.249
Peter agreed to take Adam
Tuesday nights

01:21.282 --> 01:22.683
and every other weekend,

01:22.716 --> 01:24.852
but now,
that's not good enough.

01:24.885 --> 01:26.654
We had a court date
this morning.

01:26.687 --> 01:29.290
Peter's suing
for sole custody.

01:31.859 --> 01:33.294
But not for Eric?

01:33.327 --> 01:36.164
Eric and Adam
are half brothers.

01:36.197 --> 01:36.930
The boys have
different fathers.

01:36.964 --> 01:39.500
Eric's from
my first marriage.

01:39.533 --> 01:41.669
Adam was watching me play
The Hulk on my X-Box.

01:41.702 --> 01:43.737
Then Mom put him to bed.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.539
You guys play together a lot?

01:45.573 --> 01:47.141
Sometimes.

01:47.175 --> 01:48.476
Outside?

01:48.509 --> 01:50.711
Only when Mom's with us.

01:50.744 --> 01:52.746
Eric, do you ever notice
any strangers

01:52.780 --> 01:53.914
watching you while you play?

01:53.947 --> 01:55.649
No.

01:55.683 --> 01:57.551
STABLER:
Liv, they need us

01:57.585 --> 01:59.187
upstairs.

02:00.221 --> 02:02.223
The dad could have taken
Adam from school.

02:02.256 --> 02:03.257
Why risk breaking in?

02:03.291 --> 02:04.492
I don't think
he broke in.

02:04.525 --> 02:05.793
Take a close look.

02:05.826 --> 02:06.727
See the edges of the cut?

02:06.760 --> 02:08.829
BENSON:
The screen's been
pushed outward.

02:08.862 --> 02:11.665
Perp sliced it from
inside the house.

02:11.699 --> 02:14.568
To make it look like
Adam was kidnapped.

02:16.537 --> 02:20.808
Captioning sponsored by
UNIVERSAL NETWORK TELEVISION

02:20.841 --> 02:23.544

03:04.618 --> 03:06.887
CRAGEN:
This flyer's gone out to
every precinct in the city,

03:06.920 --> 03:09.357
every police department in
the tri-state, and the FBI.

03:09.390 --> 03:10.891
Captain, any response
to the Amber Alert?

03:10.924 --> 03:13.427
We've had numerous calls;
we're checking each one out.

03:13.461 --> 03:15.496
Now, unless there are any
further developments,

03:15.529 --> 03:17.231
the next briefing will be
in two hours.

03:17.265 --> 03:20.268
All right, thank you.
That's all.

03:20.301 --> 03:21.269
Who has keys to the house?

03:21.302 --> 03:22.336
Just the cleaning lady.

03:22.370 --> 03:24.438
Comes twice a week,
we're trying to locate her.

03:24.472 --> 03:26.574
But we're still thinking
it's a custody snatch.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.509
Divorce wasn't finalized
until a month ago,

03:28.542 --> 03:30.811
and Peter didn't move out
of the house until then.

03:30.844 --> 03:32.012
He still has
a working key?

03:32.045 --> 03:33.814
Carolyn never
changed the locks.

03:33.847 --> 03:35.916
Divorce 101.
First thing my ex-wives did.

03:35.949 --> 03:37.818
Smart women.

03:37.851 --> 03:38.919
You guys find Adam's father?

03:38.952 --> 03:41.021
FIN:
He wasn't home,
and three shifts of doormen say

03:41.054 --> 03:43.457
they haven't seen him
since he left for work
yesterday morning.

03:43.491 --> 03:45.359
His and Carolyn's court date
was set for 10:00--

03:45.393 --> 03:46.394
that's 15 minutes ago.

03:46.427 --> 03:47.861
Court officers haven't
seen him yet.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.463
The precinct cops
say Peter's been here

03:49.497 --> 03:51.632
every night for the past
two weeks demanding
to see Adam.

03:51.665 --> 03:52.633
Any violence?

03:52.666 --> 03:53.501
MUNCH:
Everything but.

03:53.534 --> 03:56.036
Except for last night,
Peter didn't show.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.671
Put details
on Peter Forbes'
home and office.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.307
And let's get traps
on his credit cards.

03:59.340 --> 04:01.375
If he tried to skip town
with Adam we can track him.

04:01.409 --> 04:03.611
We might not have to.

04:03.644 --> 04:05.713
Peter's on the set.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.981
What are you doing here,
you son of a bitch?

04:08.015 --> 04:09.016
I'm Adam's father...

04:09.049 --> 04:10.017
Where is he?!

04:10.050 --> 04:11.385
You think I took him?

04:11.419 --> 04:13.554
How could you do this
to your own son?!

04:13.587 --> 04:15.723
I don't have him,
you crazy bitch.
You liar!

04:15.756 --> 04:17.024
Carolyn, Carolyn, Carolyn.

04:17.057 --> 04:18.459
Listen to me,
both of you.

04:18.492 --> 04:19.793
You're going to have

04:19.827 --> 04:22.296
to put your problems aside
and work with us together.

04:22.330 --> 04:22.996
Do you understand?

04:23.030 --> 04:24.365
She's insane.

04:24.398 --> 04:26.434
He stole my baby!

04:26.467 --> 04:28.068
Mr. Forbes,
I'm Detective Stabler.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.037
I need to ask you
some questions.
Of course.

04:30.070 --> 04:31.972
Do you mind if we wait
for my attorney?

04:32.005 --> 04:33.674
He should be
here any minute.

04:38.078 --> 04:39.680
I don't care what she told you.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.315
I didn't kidnap my own son.

04:41.349 --> 04:42.850
CRAGEN:
Nobody is accusing you

04:42.883 --> 04:43.817
of anything, Mr. Forbes.

04:43.851 --> 04:45.553
But when there's
a custody fight,

04:45.586 --> 04:46.787
we have to rule
everybody out.

04:46.820 --> 04:49.690
God knows where Adam is
and you're wasting
your time with me.

04:49.723 --> 04:50.858
STABLER:
We wouldn't be if we knew
where you were last night.

04:50.891 --> 04:51.892
Oh, for crying out loud.

04:51.925 --> 04:53.927
I was at my
girlfriend's place.

04:53.961 --> 04:54.862
Ira,
help me out here.

04:54.895 --> 04:57.097
My client will be glad
to give you her name.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.332
She'll vouch for him.

04:58.366 --> 05:00.601
I'm sure she will,
Mr. Rosenman.

05:00.634 --> 05:01.702
Where'd you go from there?

05:01.735 --> 05:03.504
Motor Vehicles.
My license expired.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.439
I was trying to renew it.
I have receipts.

05:05.473 --> 05:06.707
How come you didn't make
your court date?

05:06.740 --> 05:07.908
ROSENMAN:
He was on his way
in a cab

05:07.941 --> 05:09.377
when he heard the news
on the radio.

05:09.410 --> 05:10.878
Had the cabbie bring him here.

05:10.911 --> 05:13.347
Businessman like you
doesn't own a cell phone?

05:13.381 --> 05:14.281
It was turned off.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.849
But believe me, I got her
crazy messages

05:15.883 --> 05:16.917
as soon as I turned it back on.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.719
Yeah, to call
Mr. Rosenman here.

05:18.752 --> 05:21.822
I brought Ira because
I knew Carolyn

05:21.855 --> 05:24.892
would try to turn this on me,
just like everything else.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.827
She got half my money,
my house...

05:26.860 --> 05:27.828
And Adam.

05:27.861 --> 05:29.062
You're suing for sole custody.

05:29.096 --> 05:30.564
Afraid you might lose?

05:30.598 --> 05:31.865
You think I have Adam?

05:31.899 --> 05:34.935
Search my place, take my DNA,
my fingerprints,

05:34.968 --> 05:36.370
whatever you need.

05:36.404 --> 05:38.672
But I'm telling you,
I love my son.

05:38.706 --> 05:41.742
I would never put him through
this kind of hell.

05:43.811 --> 05:44.778
Motor Vehicles confirms

05:44.812 --> 05:46.747
Peter got there just after
8:00 this morning.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.882
Girlfriend swears he was
with her all last night.

05:48.916 --> 05:49.950
Forget the
cleaning lady.

05:49.983 --> 05:52.553
She's been in Antigua since
Friday visiting family.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.555
Which leaves Carolyn herself,
or big brother Eric.

05:54.588 --> 05:56.924
Is he capable of doing something
to his little brother?

05:56.957 --> 05:58.125
I didn't get
that vibe from him.

05:58.158 --> 05:59.560
But with the custody
battle going on,

05:59.593 --> 06:01.662
Adam's probably getting
most of Mom's attention.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.497
Eric got tired of it,
anything's possible.

06:03.531 --> 06:05.365
Maybe we should ask him,
before he skips.

06:07.935 --> 06:09.870
Eric...

06:09.903 --> 06:10.871
Can I help you?

06:10.904 --> 06:11.872
They're cops, Dad.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.140
Detectives Benson and Stabler.

06:13.173 --> 06:15.175
You're Eric's father?
Steven Manning.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.144
I'm taking Eric until
this is ironed out.

06:17.177 --> 06:18.446
Can I have
a word with you?

06:18.479 --> 06:20.013
Sure. Anything
I can do to help.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.415
Stay with the detective.

06:21.449 --> 06:23.150
Why don't you have
a seat over here.

06:23.183 --> 06:24.452
Sorry that we, uh,

06:24.485 --> 06:25.953
we got
interrupted before.

06:25.986 --> 06:28.789
So, Eric, you and Adam are
pretty tight, right?

06:28.822 --> 06:30.090
I guess.

06:30.123 --> 06:31.725
And when you lived
with Adam's dad,

06:31.759 --> 06:33.193
were you pretty tight
with him, too?

06:33.226 --> 06:34.728
Not really.

06:34.762 --> 06:37.898
I mean, Peter's cool and all,
but I got my own dad.

06:37.931 --> 06:42.503
Did Peter or your mom ever
talk about taking Adam away?

06:42.536 --> 06:45.773
If you know something,
you've got to tell us.

06:45.806 --> 06:47.174
I can't.

06:47.207 --> 06:48.041
I'll get in trouble.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.143
You'll get in trouble
with who, Eric?

06:50.177 --> 06:51.912
Mom.

06:51.945 --> 06:55.849
What did
your mom say?

06:55.883 --> 06:58.919
Eric... it's okay.

07:00.153 --> 07:04.892
That she'd hide Adam before
she'd let Peter have him.

07:04.925 --> 07:07.461
That was just talk.

07:07.495 --> 07:08.762
I was angry.

07:08.796 --> 07:11.231
I thought I was going
to lose custody.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.033
STABLER:
We understand that.

07:13.066 --> 07:14.635
Look, if someone threatened
to take my kids,

07:14.668 --> 07:16.604
I can't say that I wouldn't do
something desperate.

07:16.637 --> 07:18.772
You really think
I'm hiding Adam?

07:18.806 --> 07:20.941
That I would harm my own son?

07:20.974 --> 07:23.210
Carolyn, we know that
you wouldn't hurt Adam.

07:23.243 --> 07:26.246
But the only way for us
to focus this investigation

07:26.279 --> 07:30.017
is to rule out everyone
who had daily access to him.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.251
Including you.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.753
Detectives?

07:32.786 --> 07:34.688
A moment? Now.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.126
I'm pretty sure you can
rule her out as a suspect.

07:39.159 --> 07:41.261
I brought a dummy screen
to show you, and this.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.229
A fingerprint.

07:42.262 --> 07:44.732
Fresh off the handrail
of the fire escape.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.800
Matches several prints
on the screen.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.135
Why is there a print outside

07:48.168 --> 07:50.103
when the screen was cut
from inside the house?

07:50.137 --> 07:51.271
I asked myself
the same question.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.773
So I took another look
at the screen

07:52.806 --> 07:54.842
and found this under
the microscope.

07:54.875 --> 07:55.843
It's oxidation.

07:55.876 --> 07:56.944
Happens when the
screen and frame

07:56.977 --> 07:57.945
are exposed
to the elements.

07:57.978 --> 07:58.946
So, what's
the problem?

07:58.979 --> 07:59.513
This side of the screen

07:59.547 --> 08:00.581
is supposed to face out.

08:00.614 --> 08:01.815
But it's less weathered

08:01.849 --> 08:03.951
than the side
that's supposed to face in.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.052
So the screen was
in backwards.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.087
They took it out to clean it
and just put it in wrong.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.622
Which means that it was
cut from the outside

08:08.656 --> 08:09.923
by a perp who came up
the fire escape.

08:09.957 --> 08:10.991
You get a hit
on those prints?

08:11.024 --> 08:13.561
Sorry. Not in the system.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.295
We got to go.
BENSON:
What's up?

08:15.328 --> 08:16.396
Fin just called.

08:16.429 --> 08:18.799
Adam may have been spotted
three blocks from here.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.704
FIN:
A newspaper delivery guy saw

08:23.737 --> 08:25.138
a man carrying a boy in pajamas

08:25.172 --> 08:27.775
around the grocery store
at 5:00 a.m. this morning.

08:27.808 --> 08:29.877
Called when he saw
the kidnapping on TV.

08:29.910 --> 08:31.979
You think Adam and
whoever snatched
him are inside?

08:32.012 --> 08:33.847
Precinct's cops said
this place has been open

08:33.881 --> 08:35.583
every day for 12 years,
except today.

08:35.616 --> 08:36.717
And they can't locate
the owner.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.085
How you want
to play it, Captain?

08:38.118 --> 08:41.254
Lift the gate.
Let's take a look inside.

08:45.726 --> 08:47.628
We've got a victim down.
Some movement.

08:47.661 --> 08:48.629
Take the door.

08:48.662 --> 08:50.097
Give me your flashlight.

09:08.616 --> 09:09.817
He's cut, but he's breathing.

09:09.850 --> 09:10.918
Sir, we're the police.

09:10.951 --> 09:12.720
We're going to get you
to a hospital.

09:12.753 --> 09:13.921
You hang in there, okay?

09:13.954 --> 09:15.589
STABLER:
Got another one here.

09:15.623 --> 09:16.657
CRAGEN:
Go. I got him.

09:20.093 --> 09:22.129
All set?

09:27.134 --> 09:29.670
That's stairs to a basement.

09:36.644 --> 09:38.245
FIN:
Clear on the left.

09:38.278 --> 09:39.647
Clear on the right.

09:39.680 --> 09:40.681
BENSON:
Guys...

09:40.714 --> 09:42.349
check this out.

09:44.785 --> 09:46.620
Home sweet home.

09:46.654 --> 09:50.023
One of the victims
must sleep here.

09:50.057 --> 09:51.725
Or whoever stabbed them.

09:51.759 --> 09:52.893
Look at this.

09:52.926 --> 09:56.096
STABLER:
That was taken
in the store here.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.631
It's Adam.

10:05.939 --> 10:06.840
The deceased victim is
Lester Hale, store owner.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.210
Multiple stab wounds
to the chest.

10:10.243 --> 10:12.780
This guy's the
assistant manager,
Emilio Vasquez.

10:12.813 --> 10:15.683
Unconscious, but EMS thinks
he's going to make it.

10:15.716 --> 10:17.150
What about
our basement resident?

10:17.184 --> 10:18.051
The precinct cops say

10:18.085 --> 10:20.654
the guy that works
here, his name is Kevin.

10:20.688 --> 10:21.588
Nobody's seen him today,

10:21.621 --> 10:24.057
but people I canvassed
say he's a little off.

10:24.091 --> 10:25.058
Captain!

10:25.092 --> 10:27.060
Get a sketch artist
down here.

10:27.094 --> 10:28.896
Perp left us some
patent prints.

10:28.929 --> 10:30.831
Forgot to wipe the
blood off his hands

10:30.864 --> 10:32.800
after he opened the
doors from the inside.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.134
So he stabbed
the victims,

10:34.167 --> 10:35.736
he takes Adam
down into the basement

10:35.769 --> 10:36.937
and they come out
this way.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.071
And goes
who knows where.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.272
The blood trail
ends here.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.273
What do you got?

10:40.307 --> 10:41.742
So far, just
this picture.

10:41.775 --> 10:43.076
Found three more.

10:43.110 --> 10:45.078
"I'm coming
to get you, Son."

10:45.112 --> 10:46.379
He thinks Adam
is his boy.

10:46.413 --> 10:48.782
STABLER:
He's been stalking
him for months.

10:48.816 --> 10:49.883
Those kids are
wearing winter jackets.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.919
Here's the Forbes' brownstone,
labeled "Tate's house."

10:51.952 --> 10:54.755
"Tate's Room." He even
scoped out Adam's window.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.757
He's X-ed out the faces

10:56.790 --> 10:58.291
of the other kids
in this picture,

10:58.325 --> 10:59.727
but he's completely
obliterated

10:59.760 --> 11:00.861
the face of the mother.

11:00.894 --> 11:02.896
She's the one that could
pose a threat to his fantasy.

11:02.930 --> 11:04.064
So he snatches the kid,

11:04.097 --> 11:05.766
and takes him down
to his bedroom.

11:05.799 --> 11:07.835
The victims catch him
in the act with the boy.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.169
He chases them upstairs,
stabs them

11:09.202 --> 11:10.437
so they can't talk.

11:10.470 --> 11:12.840
Except that his bed is so neat
you can bounce a quarter off it.

11:12.873 --> 11:14.441
I don't think he'd take
the time to make it

11:14.474 --> 11:15.909
after he just stabbed
two people.

11:15.943 --> 11:16.877
Adam's not defaced

11:16.910 --> 11:18.011
in any of these pictures.

11:18.045 --> 11:20.447
A pedophile has his choice
of any kid on the street,

11:20.480 --> 11:21.749
but this guy believes

11:21.782 --> 11:23.784
he has an absolute right
to Adam.

11:23.817 --> 11:24.684
So this isn't a pedophile.

11:24.718 --> 11:26.820
I doubt it. But the
clock's still ticking

11:26.854 --> 11:28.488
and he's in a volatile state;
so if Adam sets him off,

11:28.521 --> 11:29.622
then he's going to probably
kill him, too.

11:29.656 --> 11:31.859
So we got to find out
who this Kevin is in a hurry.

11:31.892 --> 11:33.093
Maybe we
should start
with Carolyn.

11:33.126 --> 11:35.262
The window's three stories high.

11:35.295 --> 11:37.064
He knows it's Adam's room.

11:37.097 --> 11:38.799
He must have been inside.

11:38.832 --> 11:40.968
Kevin from the grocery store?

11:41.001 --> 11:42.269
I never let him in here.

11:42.302 --> 11:43.804
Why, did he do
something?

11:43.837 --> 11:45.873
Well, every time Adam
and I were there,

11:45.906 --> 11:46.874
Kevin gave him

11:46.907 --> 11:49.342
a candy bar

11:49.376 --> 11:51.311
and I thought it was
a little weird.

11:51.344 --> 11:52.212
( phone rings )

11:52.245 --> 11:53.914
And you never once
saw him follow you home?

11:53.947 --> 11:55.082
No.

11:55.115 --> 11:56.149
Stabler.

11:56.183 --> 12:00.520
What kind of person stalks
a five-year-old child?

12:00.553 --> 12:03.857
Kevin believes
that Adam is his son.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.525
You just have to think
positive,

12:05.558 --> 12:07.795
that he wouldn't harm
his own child.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.229
Assistant manager
just woke up
from surgery.

12:09.262 --> 12:12.833
Two of our detectives
will be talking to him now.

12:14.902 --> 12:16.036
Lester and I came in

12:16.069 --> 12:18.171
and Carolyn was there
with the boy.

12:18.205 --> 12:19.172
This boy?

12:19.206 --> 12:20.808
Kevin says he's his son,

12:20.841 --> 12:22.876
but I knew the kid
from deliveries.

12:22.910 --> 12:25.278
Lester told me
to take him back home.

12:25.312 --> 12:26.914
What happened?

12:26.947 --> 12:28.515
Kevin went loco.

12:28.548 --> 12:31.785
He said we were "hombres malos."

12:31.819 --> 12:36.824
I tried to grab the boy,
and Kevin stabbed me.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.191
Then Lester tried
to stop him

12:38.225 --> 12:39.827
and Kevin cut him, too.

12:39.860 --> 12:42.162
Kevin ever mention
any favorite places of his,

12:42.195 --> 12:43.563
some place he might have
taken Adam?

12:43.596 --> 12:47.935
He mostly just talked
to himself.

12:47.968 --> 12:50.838
Lester said Kevin has demons
in his head.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.472
He feels sorry for him

12:52.505 --> 12:55.108
because he lost his house
and family,

12:55.142 --> 12:56.576
so he let Kevin live
in the basement

12:56.609 --> 12:58.145
in exchange for work.

12:58.178 --> 12:59.546
For how long?

12:59.579 --> 13:03.516
Seven, maybe eight months.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.853
Did Kevin ever make
a delivery to Adam's house?

13:08.488 --> 13:09.923
A couple days ago.

13:09.957 --> 13:14.494
I was alone in the store
and Kevin was all I had.

13:14.527 --> 13:17.597
He said he knew
where it was because...

13:17.630 --> 13:20.333
he used to live
across the street.

13:22.569 --> 13:23.470
Carolyn's cleaning lady

13:23.503 --> 13:25.973
let him leave a candy bar
on Adam's bed.

13:26.006 --> 13:27.975
Which explains how he
knew where Adam's room was.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.509
Okay, so the super
in Kevin's building said

13:29.542 --> 13:31.611
that he lived there
till about four years ago.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.679
He know
what happened?

13:32.712 --> 13:34.614
Said Kevin was a partner
in some big accounting firm

13:34.647 --> 13:35.615
until they fired him.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.683
Kept showing up
to work drunk.

13:36.716 --> 13:39.586
About the same time,
he got a bad case
of paranoia,

13:39.619 --> 13:41.054
started talking
to himself.

13:41.088 --> 13:41.588
He thought that everybody
in his office

13:41.621 --> 13:42.489
was staring at him.

13:42.522 --> 13:43.423
What about the family?

13:43.456 --> 13:45.525
Sold the apartment last year,
moved away

13:45.558 --> 13:48.061
when Kevin started begging
on the street corner.

13:48.095 --> 13:49.963
Kevin's wife take the son
named Tate with her?

13:49.997 --> 13:51.865
He's about five years old now,
same as Adam.

13:51.899 --> 13:54.601
Super doesn't know
where they went.

13:54.634 --> 13:57.004
Kevin lived across the
street from Adam.

13:57.037 --> 13:58.939
He panhandled on the corner,

13:58.972 --> 14:01.074
worked three blocks away
in a grocery.

14:01.108 --> 14:02.075
Seems he likes it
close to home.

14:02.109 --> 14:03.977
STABLER:
It's pretty risky
to be hanging around

14:04.011 --> 14:05.512
if he's got Adam with him.

14:05.545 --> 14:07.047
They both got to eat

14:07.080 --> 14:08.982
and Kevin's cut off
from the grocery store.

14:09.016 --> 14:10.951
Well, the precinct community
cops might know

14:10.984 --> 14:13.020
where Kevin used to go
Dumpster diving

14:13.053 --> 14:15.555
before he worked
at the grocery.

14:15.588 --> 14:16.556
Guess what.

14:16.589 --> 14:18.191
He's not in this one,
either.

14:18.225 --> 14:20.560
Cragen wants us back
at the command post.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.662
Didn't take him
five minutes to
tell you that.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.397
Three years ago,
cops picked up Kevin

14:24.431 --> 14:25.032
for yelling
at some woman
on the street

14:25.065 --> 14:26.099
he swore was
following him.

14:26.133 --> 14:29.036
But they didn't collar him,
or we'd have his prints.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.670
They just sent him off
to Bellevue Psych

14:30.703 --> 14:32.472
and that's the last
they heard of him.

14:32.505 --> 14:34.007
Until now.

14:34.041 --> 14:35.242
Across the street--
Dumpster.

14:41.314 --> 14:42.449
That's him.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.255
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

14:48.288 --> 14:49.689
I wonder if you
can help me out.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.258
I'm busy.
I can't talk to you.

14:51.291 --> 14:53.393
I was wondering if you
could just help me out.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.095
I'm looking for 569.

14:55.128 --> 14:55.963
Sorry, I'm in a hurry.
I can't talk to you.

14:55.996 --> 14:57.931
My son's waiting for me.
I'm in a hurry.

14:57.965 --> 14:59.466
Do you mean Tate?

15:01.701 --> 15:03.103
Kevin?

15:03.136 --> 15:05.205
Cacisti! Cacisti!

15:06.573 --> 15:08.475
My son-- don't let her
take my son!

15:08.508 --> 15:09.509
No one's going
to take your son!

15:09.542 --> 15:12.012
Don't let her
take my son!

15:12.045 --> 15:15.482
Cacisti! Cacisti!

15:15.515 --> 15:17.450
I know she's back there,
watching me behind the glass.

15:17.484 --> 15:18.718
I know she is.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.087
Kevin, I've told you before,

15:20.120 --> 15:21.421
there's no one
behind the mirror.

15:21.454 --> 15:23.156
You lie like a rug.
Snug as a bug in a rug.

15:23.190 --> 15:24.391
You pull the rug out
from under me,

15:24.424 --> 15:26.426
I will go underground.
I will go underground.

15:26.459 --> 15:27.127
Kevin...
You're cacisti.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.162
You are cacistis, all of you.

15:29.196 --> 15:31.031
You can run, but you can't hide.

15:31.064 --> 15:32.332
Kevin, talk to me.
Where's the boy?

15:32.365 --> 15:33.400
I won't tell you
where the boy is.

15:33.433 --> 15:34.467
I won't tell you where he is.

15:34.501 --> 15:36.336
I know who you are.
I know what's going on here.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.105
You're working
for that witch
behind the window,

15:38.138 --> 15:39.206
and she is evil.

15:39.239 --> 15:40.340
She is trying to steal
my thoughts

15:40.373 --> 15:41.441
and I will protect myself.

15:41.474 --> 15:43.443
I work for you.
I'm trying to help you.

15:43.476 --> 15:46.213
Just tell me where the boy is.
I want to protect the boy.

15:46.246 --> 15:48.048
Elliot, can I talk to you
for a minute?

15:48.081 --> 15:49.682
...and they want to
indoctrinate my son

15:49.716 --> 15:50.483
and I will stop them!

15:50.517 --> 15:52.219
I will stop them!
I will stop you!

15:52.252 --> 15:53.386
I will stop you!

15:53.420 --> 15:56.089
I have news for you.
I will stop you!

15:56.123 --> 15:58.425
The guy's hopeless.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.227
He's a paranoid
schizophrenic

16:00.260 --> 16:02.329
and these cacistis
are his delusion.

16:02.362 --> 16:05.165
You're not going to get
anything more out of him.

16:05.198 --> 16:08.701
Well, he's got a five-year-old
kid stashed out there somewhere.

16:08.735 --> 16:09.769
And he's decompensating.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.338
Any more stress,
and he could go into

16:11.371 --> 16:12.639
a psychotic break
and he'll never talk.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.007
He needs medication.

16:14.041 --> 16:15.475
You got a medical bag.

16:15.508 --> 16:17.177
You got anything in there

16:17.210 --> 16:18.611
to make him lucid
enough to talk?

16:18.645 --> 16:21.548
Yes, but I can't give it to him
just to make him confess.

16:21.581 --> 16:22.582
Why not?

16:22.615 --> 16:24.517
Because he's not my patient.

16:24.551 --> 16:26.386
I could lose my license.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.321
We need to get him
to a psych hospital

16:28.355 --> 16:29.689
for treatment.

16:29.722 --> 16:32.292
And lose him
in the mental health system?

16:32.325 --> 16:34.227
We don't have that kind of time.

16:34.261 --> 16:35.628
Well, we don't have a choice.

16:35.662 --> 16:36.563
Without medication,

16:36.596 --> 16:37.130
he's never going to be able
to tell you

16:37.164 --> 16:41.401
what you need to know.

16:41.434 --> 16:43.570
How fast can you make it happen?

16:46.406 --> 16:47.440
I'll make some calls.

16:47.474 --> 16:50.443
Any luck, he'll be able
to talk tomorrow morning.

16:54.147 --> 16:56.249
I appreciate that.
Thank you very much. Bye-bye.

16:56.283 --> 16:57.650
Hey. Found Kevin's
wife and son.

16:57.684 --> 16:58.485
Jersey City.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.520
Doesn't want anything
to do with him.

17:00.553 --> 17:02.055
Oh, too bad.
Did you get him
in somewhere?

17:02.089 --> 17:03.390
Yeah. Bellevue Psych's
going to take him.

17:03.423 --> 17:05.058
The bus is going
to be here any minute.

17:05.092 --> 17:07.260
( crash )
Is Elliot still in there
with Kevin?

17:07.294 --> 17:08.295
What the hell's going on?

17:08.328 --> 17:09.429
You're one of them!

17:09.462 --> 17:10.697
They sent you!

17:11.531 --> 17:13.166
Elliot!

17:13.200 --> 17:15.302
Need a little help in here!
She sent you!

17:15.335 --> 17:16.136
She's the one
who did this!
Elliot.

17:16.169 --> 17:18.138
She wants Tate.
You can't have him!

17:18.171 --> 17:19.406
You can never have him!

17:19.439 --> 17:20.773
He's locked away!
Hidden away!

17:20.807 --> 17:22.675
My medical bag's
in your office.
Go!

17:22.709 --> 17:24.211
...secret police probes!

17:24.244 --> 17:27.647
Your drones, your spies,
your agents!

17:27.680 --> 17:28.515
What the hell happened?!

17:28.548 --> 17:30.517
I told him he was going
to the hospital!

17:30.550 --> 17:32.252
He freaked out on me.

17:32.285 --> 17:33.420
Grabs a chair.
Knocked over the table.

17:33.453 --> 17:34.321
Your stealth weapons!

17:34.354 --> 17:35.755
Oh, you can kill me,
you can murder me,

17:35.788 --> 17:36.856
but you can't find my son!

17:36.889 --> 17:37.857
Here you go, Doc.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.559
You will never
find my son!

17:41.394 --> 17:42.695
Come on, we got him, Doc.
Let's go!

17:42.729 --> 17:44.464
What are you
giving him?

17:44.497 --> 17:46.166
Ativan and Haldol.

17:46.199 --> 17:48.535
Hold him still!
Got it.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.303
( screaming ):
No!

17:50.337 --> 17:51.238
No!

17:51.271 --> 17:54.407
It'll take about ten minutes
to kick in.

17:54.441 --> 17:56.443
No!

17:58.145 --> 17:59.146
He stable?

17:59.179 --> 18:00.247
Enough to transport.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.514
I need two minutes
with him.

18:01.548 --> 18:03.350
Well, you better
make it quick.

18:03.383 --> 18:05.218
He's on the express
to La-La Land.

18:09.589 --> 18:10.457
Kevin,

18:10.490 --> 18:12.392
where's Tate?

18:12.425 --> 18:15.262
Don't be scared, Tate.

18:15.295 --> 18:16.729
Daddy'll be home soon.

18:16.763 --> 18:17.697
Hey.

18:17.730 --> 18:18.731
Kevin, Kevin!

18:18.765 --> 18:20.400
You're not pulling that
on me now.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.402
Where's your son?
Where's Tate?

18:22.435 --> 18:24.304
Look out the window, baby.

18:24.337 --> 18:26.506
Look out the window, Tater.

18:26.539 --> 18:30.543
See the man
with the big white hat?

18:30.577 --> 18:31.911
Hey, hey!

18:31.944 --> 18:33.380
Kevin, come on. Come on, Kevin.

18:33.413 --> 18:34.147
Hey, what are you
trying to do?

18:34.181 --> 18:34.814
I'm trying to wake
him the hell up.

18:34.847 --> 18:36.683
A nuclear bomb
won't wake him

18:36.716 --> 18:37.750
with what the doc
gave him.

18:49.196 --> 18:49.729
FIN:
We've been through

18:50.397 --> 18:51.664
every building
within 12 blocks

18:51.698 --> 18:52.499
of the kidnap site.

18:52.532 --> 18:54.534
Have the teams
go two more blocks.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.203
Adam has been gone for 36 hours.

18:56.236 --> 18:57.237
What are we missing?

18:57.270 --> 18:58.738
"Look out
the window, Tater,

18:58.771 --> 19:00.840
see the man in
the big white hat?"

19:00.873 --> 19:02.209
When did he
say that?

19:02.242 --> 19:03.810
He mumbled it when
they put him on the bus.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.678
Sounds like a parent
talking to a baby.

19:05.712 --> 19:06.779
Do we know where
Kevin lived

19:06.813 --> 19:08.681
immediately after
his son was born?

19:08.715 --> 19:09.682
Two-family
house

19:09.716 --> 19:10.717
in Astoria.

19:10.750 --> 19:11.584
The 109 Precinct checked it

19:11.618 --> 19:13.253
and the entire
neighborhood--nothing.

19:13.286 --> 19:14.254
What about where
he grew up?

19:14.287 --> 19:16.356
Maybe he's flashing back
on his own childhood.

19:16.389 --> 19:17.557
MUNCH:
DMV has every
address

19:17.590 --> 19:19.526
where Kevin
had a driver's license.

19:19.559 --> 19:22.462
The earliest one was East 200th
Street in the Bronx

19:22.495 --> 19:23.763
when he was seventeen.

19:23.796 --> 19:24.697
Manhattan
Special Victims?

19:24.731 --> 19:25.698
Stabler, Benson.

19:25.732 --> 19:27.200
Thanks for helping
us out here.

19:27.234 --> 19:28.768
If you want
to call it that.

19:28.801 --> 19:29.902
There's your location.

19:29.936 --> 19:31.371
The parking lot?

19:31.404 --> 19:32.239
Sorry.

19:32.272 --> 19:34.207
We checked the buildings
on either side,

19:34.241 --> 19:35.141
no sign of him.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.310
We'll go through them
again if you like.

19:37.344 --> 19:39.479
Not necessary,
thanks.

19:39.512 --> 19:42.882
Hey, I hope you
find your kid.

19:42.915 --> 19:46.253
( tires squealing )

19:46.286 --> 19:47.420
Damn it.

19:47.454 --> 19:48.855
We have nowhere
left to look.

19:50.657 --> 19:52.292
Elliot, back up, back up,
back up.

19:52.325 --> 19:54.427
Man in a white hat,
around the corner,

19:54.461 --> 19:55.695
down that
side street.

20:08.775 --> 20:11.278
He was talking about
that bakery.

20:11.311 --> 20:12.845
Elliot, that building,
boarded up.

20:14.647 --> 20:16.449
The building's
condemned.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.520
Perfect view from here
of the sign.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.725
Adam!

20:25.758 --> 20:28.495
Adam Forbes, you in there?!

20:30.397 --> 20:32.565
Adam!
This is the police.

20:32.599 --> 20:35.568
If you can hear us,
bang on something.

20:40.873 --> 20:42.975
There's no way
to get in back here.

20:43.009 --> 20:47.380
( faint clanging )

20:47.414 --> 20:50.016
Adam, do it again!

20:50.049 --> 20:52.519
Bang again!

20:52.552 --> 20:54.721
( clanging )

20:54.754 --> 20:55.688
I can hear him,

20:55.722 --> 20:57.390
I just can't tell
where it's coming from.

20:57.424 --> 21:00.327
( clanging )

21:00.360 --> 21:02.695
Kevin's gotten in and
out of there quickly.

21:02.729 --> 21:04.797
We're going to need
flashlights.

21:04.831 --> 21:05.832
And a crowbar.

21:13.740 --> 21:14.707
You okay?

21:14.741 --> 21:15.742
Yeah.

21:18.978 --> 21:23.650
Manhattan SVU to Central,
requesting a bus and ESU

21:23.683 --> 21:26.986
to 511 Valentine Avenue
in the Bronx.

21:41.601 --> 21:42.869
Watch it!

21:46.005 --> 21:48.875
Place is a hellhole.

21:48.908 --> 21:50.743
Adam, it's the police!

21:50.777 --> 21:52.111
Knock again!

21:52.144 --> 21:55.482
( clanging )

21:55.515 --> 21:56.849
Elliot!

21:56.883 --> 21:58.651
Are you all right?

21:58.685 --> 22:01.721
Aside from my armpits
killing me, I'm fine.

22:01.754 --> 22:03.089
Take the flashlight.

22:05.525 --> 22:06.926
Step back.

22:06.959 --> 22:09.862
( clanging )

22:09.896 --> 22:11.798
It's coming from
upstairs.

22:11.831 --> 22:13.866
Hold on.

22:13.900 --> 22:17.770
( groaning )

22:17.804 --> 22:20.873
( clanging )

22:24.110 --> 22:26.045
( muffled cries )

22:26.078 --> 22:27.414
Adam...

22:27.447 --> 22:28.781
BENSON:
Adam, we're police officers.

22:28.815 --> 22:30.550
We're here to help you.
Are you okay?

22:30.583 --> 22:31.718
I think so.

22:31.751 --> 22:33.453
You think so?

22:33.486 --> 22:34.821
You okay?

22:34.854 --> 22:36.689
We're going to get
you loose here.

22:36.723 --> 22:37.890
Is Kevin coming back?

22:37.924 --> 22:38.858
No, you're safe now.

22:42.829 --> 22:45.765
Kevin hurt those guys
in the grocery store.

22:45.798 --> 22:46.899
We know, sweetheart.

22:46.933 --> 22:49.869
We're going to take you to
your mommy and daddy now.

22:49.902 --> 22:52.739
He said he had to protect me.

22:52.772 --> 22:54.707
( sirens approaching )

22:54.741 --> 22:56.008
Okay, you're
going home.

23:07.854 --> 23:09.856
Casey Novak?

23:09.889 --> 23:11.057
Yes?

23:12.925 --> 23:14.026
Rebecca Balthus.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.896
Kevin Walker's
Legal Aid attorney.

23:16.929 --> 23:19.532
Your, uh, boss order you

23:19.566 --> 23:20.633
to try my client?

23:20.667 --> 23:21.668
No, that was my decision,

23:21.701 --> 23:23.770
but the District Attorney
did sign off on it.

23:23.803 --> 23:25.004
Waste of time
and money.

23:25.037 --> 23:26.539
Kevin's a lunatic.

23:26.573 --> 23:28.441
Your client kidnapped
a five-year-old boy,

23:28.475 --> 23:29.509
murdered a man

23:29.542 --> 23:31.944
and almost killed another
who tried to stop him.

23:31.978 --> 23:34.514
And a jury will
institutionalize him quicker

23:34.547 --> 23:35.915
than you can say "cacisti."

23:35.948 --> 23:37.784
He's schizophrenic.

23:37.817 --> 23:39.552
He stalked
Adam Forbes

23:39.586 --> 23:40.620
for months.

23:40.653 --> 23:42.455
He took photographs
to help plan the kidnapping.

23:42.489 --> 23:43.823
He knew what
he was doing was wrong.

23:43.856 --> 23:44.791
He tied the boy up,

23:44.824 --> 23:46.826
and consciously tried
to elude the police.

23:46.859 --> 23:47.827
Because

23:47.860 --> 23:51.163
a bunch of little men
in his head told him to.

23:51.197 --> 23:52.899
We're pleading insanity.

23:52.932 --> 23:54.767
You'll get his psych records.
Read them.

23:54.801 --> 23:55.702
Not good enough.

23:55.735 --> 23:57.737
I want him examined
by our psychiatrist.

23:57.770 --> 23:59.438
Thank you.

24:01.040 --> 24:04.511
KEVIN:
They started talking to me
when I was 25.

24:04.544 --> 24:05.812
HUANG:
Who's "they"?

24:05.845 --> 24:07.714
The cacistis?

24:07.747 --> 24:10.750
Yeah, the drinking
helped at first,

24:10.783 --> 24:13.786
but after a while
it didn't do anything.

24:13.820 --> 24:17.757
Let's talk about
Adam Forbes, okay?

24:17.790 --> 24:20.192
Okay.

24:20.226 --> 24:24.597
He came into the store one day.

24:24.631 --> 24:31.571
The cacistis told me
he was my son, Tate.

24:31.604 --> 24:33.673
I try not to listen to them,

24:33.706 --> 24:36.609
but they scream at me
if I don't.

24:36.643 --> 24:41.681
What are cacistis?

24:41.714 --> 24:45.151
Secret police.

24:45.184 --> 24:46.686
They know everything.

24:46.719 --> 24:48.120
And are they talking to you
right now?

24:48.154 --> 24:49.622
No.

24:49.656 --> 24:53.259
They go away when the
doctors give me drugs.

24:53.292 --> 24:55.227
Then why don't you
stay on the medication?

24:55.261 --> 24:57.296
I don't want to talk about that.

24:57.329 --> 24:59.699
Okay.
Fair enough.

24:59.732 --> 25:04.003
Do you remember the
night you took Adam?

25:04.036 --> 25:07.574
Yeah, I went up the fire escape
a couple of times before,

25:07.607 --> 25:09.642
but they kept telling me
to stop.

25:09.676 --> 25:12.111
Cacistis kept telling me
to stop.

25:12.144 --> 25:17.584
Until that night,
and they said it was time.

25:17.617 --> 25:20.920
Yeah, I told him not to scream,

25:20.953 --> 25:25.157
because I wasn't
going to hurt him.

25:25.191 --> 25:28.861
But he was scared.

25:28.895 --> 25:31.864
Like Lester.

25:34.901 --> 25:36.769
You feel pretty bad
about Lester, huh?

25:36.803 --> 25:38.304
I don't want to
talk about that.

25:38.337 --> 25:39.839
Why, because
you did something bad?

25:39.872 --> 25:41.307
Don't want to talk about it.

25:41.340 --> 25:42.241
Kevin...

25:42.274 --> 25:45.778
what did you do?

25:47.279 --> 25:49.982
You know I didn't mean to.

25:50.016 --> 25:52.151
I didn't want to kill him.

25:52.184 --> 25:56.122
He's the only person
who ever tried to help me.

25:56.155 --> 25:57.857
Then why did you stab him?

25:57.890 --> 25:59.225
Well,
the cacistis

25:59.258 --> 26:01.761
told me that he was going
to call the police,

26:01.794 --> 26:04.096
and that they would take
my son Tate away from me.

26:04.130 --> 26:07.634
So I grabbed a box cutter
and I couldn't stop myself.

26:07.667 --> 26:09.101
So the cacistis

26:09.135 --> 26:11.237
told you to throw the chair
at the police station?

26:11.270 --> 26:14.006
Oh, no.

26:14.040 --> 26:17.209
No, I did that
because I was scared.

26:17.243 --> 26:19.178
What were you scared of?

26:19.211 --> 26:21.280
The police officer.

26:21.313 --> 26:22.348
You were
scared

26:22.381 --> 26:24.116
of Detective Stabler?

26:24.150 --> 26:26.653
Why?

26:28.821 --> 26:32.725
When he came back in, he told me

26:32.759 --> 26:36.796
the cacistis were going
to take my son,

26:36.829 --> 26:39.198
and that if I didn't tell them
where the boy was

26:39.231 --> 26:41.834
they would kill me.

26:46.072 --> 26:47.073
It's not coercion.

26:47.106 --> 26:48.741
HUANG:
You pushed
Kevin into

26:48.775 --> 26:50.276
a psychotic break
so I would drug him

26:50.309 --> 26:51.210
so you could coerce
his confession.

26:51.243 --> 26:53.412
I did what I had to do
to save that boy.

26:53.445 --> 26:54.346
Great, what are
you going to do next?

26:54.380 --> 26:56.683
Bash in people's skulls
to make them talk?

26:56.716 --> 26:57.684
You know,
your way,

26:57.717 --> 26:58.785
Adam wouldn't have been found

26:58.818 --> 26:59.551
till he was starved to death.

26:59.585 --> 26:59.919
CRAGEN:
All right,
that's enough.

26:59.952 --> 27:01.420
Both of you.

27:01.453 --> 27:04.657
Did the medication
hurt Kevin?

27:04.691 --> 27:06.425
No.

27:06.458 --> 27:09.128
Then what's
the harm?

27:09.161 --> 27:12.264
Unless a court forces him to,
it's Kevin's choice

27:12.298 --> 27:13.432
whether
to take it.

27:13.465 --> 27:16.035
We don't have the right
to make that decision for him.

27:16.068 --> 27:17.737
Do me a favor,
stop treating this perp

27:17.770 --> 27:18.738
like he's your patient.

27:18.771 --> 27:19.605
He became
my patient

27:19.638 --> 27:20.272
the second I gave him
that injection.

27:20.306 --> 27:21.440
Do me a favor,
start thinking

27:21.473 --> 27:22.508
about the victims here.

27:22.541 --> 27:25.244
The kid he kidnapped,
the two people he stabbed.

27:25.277 --> 27:27.213
They're your victims, Doc,
not Kevin.

27:27.246 --> 27:28.380
You made Kevin a victim,

27:28.414 --> 27:30.182
and I'm going to testify
on his behalf

27:30.216 --> 27:31.283
if this goes to trial,

27:31.317 --> 27:32.184
which Kevin will win

27:32.218 --> 27:33.953
since you handed
the defense its case.

27:33.986 --> 27:36.222
How'd I do that?

27:38.991 --> 27:40.793
They're going to make you say

27:40.827 --> 27:43.763
that he wasn't rational
until he was medicated,

27:43.796 --> 27:45.765
which means he's
not responsible

27:45.798 --> 27:47.166
for his actions
before then.

27:47.199 --> 27:48.434
You get it now?

27:50.469 --> 27:52.705
Let him go,
Elliot.

27:56.142 --> 27:58.778
I didn't do anything wrong here.

27:58.811 --> 28:00.713
I understand why you did
what you did.

28:00.747 --> 28:02.982
You didn't have time
to think about the consequences.

28:03.015 --> 28:06.452
We saved that kid.

28:06.485 --> 28:08.755
Kevin goes to trial,
you testify,

28:08.788 --> 28:11.724
what you did to him
goes on the record.

28:11.758 --> 28:14.894
Every perp you collar
from then on,

28:14.927 --> 28:17.830
their lawyer's going to make you
tell the jury

28:17.864 --> 28:20.933
how you coerced a confession
from Kevin Walker.

28:22.769 --> 28:25.371
( breathes deeply )

28:25.404 --> 28:28.207
How do I make this right?

28:38.484 --> 28:41.153
Well, you got some
pop in that bat.

28:43.522 --> 28:46.258
Bet you didn't come all the way
here to watch me swing.

28:46.292 --> 28:49.428
I need you to plead
Kevin Walker out.

28:49.461 --> 28:51.463
Why is that?

28:51.497 --> 28:53.766
I can't tell you.

28:53.800 --> 28:56.903
Oh, well, I don't really
need to know, do I?

28:56.936 --> 28:58.470
You're an officer
of the court.

28:58.504 --> 29:02.074
And you don't want whatever
happened going on the record.

29:02.108 --> 29:05.011
I don't know your detectives
and I don't know you.

29:06.545 --> 29:08.114
When you worked felonies,

29:08.147 --> 29:09.849
you had a different cop
on every case, right?

29:09.882 --> 29:11.150
Yeah. So?

29:11.183 --> 29:13.085
Special Victims,
it's just us.

29:13.119 --> 29:14.420
We got
to trust each other.

29:16.488 --> 29:19.258
You're asking for
a hell of a lot of trust.

29:21.527 --> 29:23.395
Either way, Kevin Walker
goes someplace

29:23.429 --> 29:24.797
where he can't hurt anybody.

29:24.831 --> 29:26.565
You take him to trial,
a good detective

29:26.598 --> 29:27.867
loses his credibility

29:27.900 --> 29:28.901
as a cop.

29:28.935 --> 29:31.570
He'll never be able
to testify in court again.

29:31.603 --> 29:32.438
His only choices

29:32.471 --> 29:34.841
will be to quit or
finish his career

29:34.874 --> 29:36.508
in the Property
Clerk's office.

29:38.544 --> 29:41.580
What this detective did
was necessary?

29:41.613 --> 29:43.082
Under the circumstances,

29:43.115 --> 29:45.451
I can't say I would
have done any different.

29:45.484 --> 29:47.519
Can you assure me
the defendant wasn't hurt

29:47.553 --> 29:50.256
and I'm not going to get
my ass kicked in court

29:50.289 --> 29:52.391
on a technicality?

29:52.424 --> 29:54.360
Yes.

30:03.202 --> 30:04.937
KEVIN:
I kidnapped Adam Forbes

30:04.971 --> 30:08.140
because I thought
he was my son Tate.

30:08.174 --> 30:11.143
I stabbed Lester Hale
and Emilio Vasquez

30:11.177 --> 30:14.313
because I was afraid they
would take him away.

30:17.884 --> 30:20.352
I'm a paranoid
schizophrenic,

30:20.386 --> 30:23.622
and was not medicated
at the time.

30:23.655 --> 30:26.158
And though I am not
being held

30:26.192 --> 30:29.461
legally accountable
for my actions,

30:29.495 --> 30:35.301
I feel completely
responsible for them.

30:35.334 --> 30:37.403
You can never know
how sorry I am

30:37.436 --> 30:40.272
for all the harm I've caused.

30:43.009 --> 30:44.176
Are the People

30:44.210 --> 30:45.277
satisfied the requirements

30:45.311 --> 30:47.013
of the plea agreement
have been met?

30:47.046 --> 30:49.148
We are, Your Honor.

30:49.181 --> 30:50.316
The defendant
will rise.

30:52.284 --> 30:53.085
Kevin James Walker,

30:53.119 --> 30:55.154
on the counts of
second degree murder,

30:55.187 --> 30:56.923
attempted murder and kidnapping,

30:56.956 --> 30:59.125
I am entering a plea
of not guilty by reason

30:59.158 --> 31:00.226
of mental disease
or defect.

31:00.259 --> 31:01.627
I order you remanded
to the custody

31:01.660 --> 31:03.195
of the Commissioner
of Mental Health

31:03.229 --> 31:04.296
until such time...
Mental Health?

31:04.330 --> 31:05.331
You can't send
me back there.

31:05.364 --> 31:06.298
Kevin, take it...

31:06.332 --> 31:08.000
Your Honor, you can't
send me back there.

31:08.034 --> 31:10.002
Please, be quiet
Mr. Walker.
They'll kill me.

31:10.036 --> 31:12.004
Another word
and I'll have you removed.
They will murder me,

31:12.038 --> 31:13.005
Your Honor,
if you send me back...

31:13.039 --> 31:14.040
Remove
the defendant.

31:14.073 --> 31:16.175
...just like they murdered
Martha. No! No! No!

31:16.208 --> 31:17.643
No, Your Honor,
listen to me.

31:17.676 --> 31:18.644
No, this is you!

31:18.677 --> 31:20.012
You did this!

31:20.046 --> 31:21.213
They sent you

31:21.247 --> 31:23.649
to shut me up so I wouldn't
talk about Martha!

31:23.682 --> 31:24.650
Don't let them kill me!

31:24.683 --> 31:26.318
Don't let them kill me
like they killed Martha!

31:26.352 --> 31:29.188
Don't send me back there!
Please don't send me!

31:33.659 --> 31:35.361
What the hell was Kevin
talking about?

31:35.394 --> 31:36.462
I have no idea.

31:36.495 --> 31:37.696
So it has nothing to do

31:37.729 --> 31:39.698
with whatever you got me
to cover up?

31:39.731 --> 31:41.567
I'm not covering up
anything.

31:41.600 --> 31:44.603
I put my ass on the line
for you when I pled Kevin out.

31:44.636 --> 31:47.673
Now he's lucid, screaming
about someone killing Martha.

31:47.706 --> 31:50.509
Well, I'm telling you I don't
know who Martha is.

31:50.542 --> 31:51.510
You better
find out.

31:51.543 --> 31:53.612
If there's been another murder
in this case,

31:53.645 --> 31:54.713
I am holding you responsible,

31:54.746 --> 31:57.249
and your dirty little secret's
going on the record.

32:09.328 --> 32:11.397
Elliot, Novak is
digging in her heels.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.399
She wants an
answer by tomorrow.

32:13.432 --> 32:15.434
Is there any chance we can
get Kevin's psych records?

32:15.467 --> 32:17.536
His pleading out takes away
our right to see them.

32:17.569 --> 32:19.638
Then how in the hell
am I going to prove to Novak

32:19.671 --> 32:21.440
that I'm not trying
to cover up for murder?

32:21.473 --> 32:24.376
We have to figure out what Kevin
was rambling on about in court.

32:24.410 --> 32:26.312
Well, I just spoke with
Kevin's social worker.

32:26.345 --> 32:27.713
Says he was never
institutionalized.

32:27.746 --> 32:29.015
Well, where was he

32:29.048 --> 32:30.449
before
Lester Hale's grocery store?

32:30.482 --> 32:32.384
BENSON:
Three years at an adult home

32:32.418 --> 32:34.353
for the mentally ill,
out in Queens,

32:34.386 --> 32:37.289
called Jackson Manor,
until he walked out a year ago.

32:37.323 --> 32:39.058
What about our mystery
murder victim Martha?

32:39.091 --> 32:40.192
Don't know.
But Jackson Manor

32:40.226 --> 32:41.060
says there hasn't been

32:41.093 --> 32:42.028
a homicide there
since the early '80s.

32:42.061 --> 32:44.563
They say why Kevin left?
No, but they couldn't

32:44.596 --> 32:45.531
force him to stay.

32:45.564 --> 32:47.666
He did tell an aide
that he was going home

32:47.699 --> 32:49.068
to his wife and son.

32:52.104 --> 32:54.340
I told the detective
on the phone

32:54.373 --> 32:56.308
that I didn't want
to talk about Kevin.

32:56.342 --> 32:57.543
Mrs. Walker, I'm sorry.

32:57.576 --> 32:59.378
I just need
to ask you one question.

32:59.411 --> 33:02.181
Did Kevin ever talk to you about
a woman named Martha?

33:02.214 --> 33:05.417
A woman who lived next door
to him at Jackson Manor?

33:05.451 --> 33:06.552
Yes, constantly. Why?

33:06.585 --> 33:08.420
Because in court
this morning,

33:08.454 --> 33:12.091
Kevin talked about someone
named Martha being murdered.

33:12.124 --> 33:14.560
Then maybe you should ask his
cacistis instead of to me.

33:14.593 --> 33:16.562
Kevin's been on
medication ever since

33:16.595 --> 33:17.696
we arrested him.

33:17.729 --> 33:19.031
He wasn't delusional.

33:19.065 --> 33:20.732
Then I don't know
what to tell you.

33:20.766 --> 33:22.134
If that's all...

33:22.168 --> 33:24.070
Do you know why he left
Jackson Manor?

33:24.103 --> 33:25.404
He said they kicked him out.

33:25.437 --> 33:27.639
When did he tell you that?

33:27.673 --> 33:29.275
Last year...

33:29.308 --> 33:32.478
when he asked to move back
in with me and Tate.

33:34.646 --> 33:36.515
You let him come back?

33:36.548 --> 33:37.649
He called from the home.

33:37.683 --> 33:39.685
Said he was on his meds,
doing great,

33:39.718 --> 33:41.287
that he wanted to see us.

33:41.320 --> 33:43.489
I told him he could come over
the next day.

33:43.522 --> 33:44.456
What happened?

33:44.490 --> 33:46.658
He showed up at
the apartment a week later.

33:46.692 --> 33:49.495
Said the cacistis wouldn't find
him here.

33:49.528 --> 33:50.462
I told him to leave.

33:50.496 --> 33:52.631
He lied to me, just like
all the other times.

33:52.664 --> 33:55.134
He wasn't
taking his meds.

33:55.167 --> 33:56.802
Did you ask him why?

33:56.835 --> 34:00.139
I loved him... I still do,

34:00.172 --> 34:02.608
but I couldn't stand
the lies anymore.

34:02.641 --> 34:06.178
He said Jackson Manor ran out
of his medication.

34:06.212 --> 34:09.081
How could that happen?

34:12.518 --> 34:16.322
I hear you're jammed up.

34:16.355 --> 34:18.857
Word travels fast.

34:18.890 --> 34:22.528
I got a call from Novak.

34:22.561 --> 34:26.365
I told her the injection
didn't harm Kevin, and...

34:26.398 --> 34:29.701
he's right
where he belongs.

34:30.902 --> 34:33.339
I'm sure you didn't
come all the way up here

34:33.372 --> 34:35.774
at this time of night
just to tell me that.

34:35.807 --> 34:38.144
No.

34:38.177 --> 34:39.445
Martha Davis, age 45.

34:39.478 --> 34:43.182
Lived in the room next to Kevin
at Jackson Manor.

34:47.186 --> 34:49.355
And I thought I was going
to have to go through

34:49.388 --> 34:51.190
every obituary on the Internet.

34:51.223 --> 34:52.824
How'd you find out
about Jackson Manor?

34:52.858 --> 34:55.661
Friend at the Health Department.

34:55.694 --> 34:57.896
This friend of yours know
how a place like that

34:57.929 --> 34:59.598
could run out of medication?

34:59.631 --> 35:01.233
You know, the good adult homes

35:01.267 --> 35:03.469
help schizophrenics
lead productive lives.

35:03.502 --> 35:06.438
The bad ones, the flophouses,
just provide minimum care

35:06.472 --> 35:09.708
while their owners line their
pockets with government money.

35:09.741 --> 35:11.143
So instead of drugs

35:11.177 --> 35:13.245
for their patients,
they use the money

35:13.279 --> 35:14.880
to buy themselves Mercedes.

35:14.913 --> 35:17.216
What was Martha Davis'
cause of death?

35:17.249 --> 35:20.118
Uh, suicide.

35:21.687 --> 35:24.390
Why'd Kevin say
she was murdered?

35:24.423 --> 35:26.725
Let's ask him.

35:34.766 --> 35:36.302
What's he doing here?

35:36.335 --> 35:38.237
We need to speak
to Kevin.

35:38.270 --> 35:39.338
Speak to him?

35:39.371 --> 35:41.173
Or send him into another
psychotic break?

35:41.207 --> 35:43.242
STABLER:
I know you didn't mean
to kill Lester.

35:44.943 --> 35:46.845
And I'm sorry

35:46.878 --> 35:49.215
about what happened.

35:51.383 --> 35:52.718
Kevin, I'm sorry.

35:52.751 --> 35:54.686
I'm sorry for
what I did.

35:54.720 --> 35:58.457
( sighs )

35:58.490 --> 36:01.227
That little boy might have died
if I hadn't found him.

36:01.260 --> 36:04.230
Yes, I know.

36:04.263 --> 36:05.897
I know.

36:07.499 --> 36:08.867
What do you want?

36:08.900 --> 36:13.839
We know you were telling the
truth about Martha in court.

36:13.872 --> 36:15.274
I can't talk about that.

36:15.307 --> 36:17.343
Why can't you talk about that?

36:17.376 --> 36:18.877
Because they'll get me.

36:18.910 --> 36:19.978
HUANG:
The cacistis?

36:20.011 --> 36:23.215
No. No.

36:23.249 --> 36:26.952
No, the people from the home.

36:26.985 --> 36:30.322
Kevin, nobody from
Jackson Manor can hurt you now.

36:32.658 --> 36:33.859
But if you're right--

36:33.892 --> 36:34.926
if they killed Martha,

36:34.960 --> 36:37.596
you know they're going to
do it to someone else

36:37.629 --> 36:40.266
some time unless we stop them.

36:40.299 --> 36:43.535
We need your help.

36:47.906 --> 36:50.709
Last summer, one day
during the heat wave

36:50.742 --> 36:52.578
Martha shut herself
in her room

36:52.611 --> 36:53.979
and wouldn't come out.

36:54.012 --> 36:55.947
I, uh... begged them
to help her

36:55.981 --> 36:57.683
because she was burning up.

36:57.716 --> 36:59.518
You see, she was burning up.

36:59.551 --> 37:02.488
And they won't turn
the air-conditioning on there

37:02.521 --> 37:04.956
unless you pay extra,
and she couldn't afford

37:04.990 --> 37:08.494
to pay extra.

37:08.527 --> 37:11.330
Kevin, what happened?

37:11.363 --> 37:13.599
Well, the same night,
I heard a commotion.

37:13.632 --> 37:14.866
They tried
to save her.

37:14.900 --> 37:17.369
They put her in a tub
full of ice water,

37:17.403 --> 37:19.338
and... you know
it was too late.

37:19.371 --> 37:21.039
And I asked them what happened,

37:21.072 --> 37:23.041
and they said
she slit her wrist;

37:23.074 --> 37:24.810
but they were lying.

37:24.843 --> 37:26.645
I knew they were lying.

37:26.678 --> 37:27.879
So I started screaming.

37:27.913 --> 37:29.948
I started screaming,
screaming at them

37:29.981 --> 37:30.949
calling them killers,

37:30.982 --> 37:33.819
telling them that I'm going
to tell the police.

37:33.852 --> 37:34.853
And the next day

37:34.886 --> 37:36.955
I went for my medication,

37:36.988 --> 37:39.825
and they told me
that they ran out.

37:39.858 --> 37:41.560
And the same thing
the next day,

37:41.593 --> 37:42.494
and the next day,

37:42.528 --> 37:44.730
and then on the fourth day,
they told me

37:44.763 --> 37:46.765
that they didn't have any room
for me

37:46.798 --> 37:48.634
and I was going
to have to leave.

37:49.935 --> 37:51.537
BALTHUS:
Kevin...

37:51.570 --> 37:53.705
why didn't you tell anyone?

37:53.739 --> 37:55.641
Well, they said if I did,

37:55.674 --> 37:58.944
what happened to Martha
would happen to me.

38:01.513 --> 38:03.615
Whoever runs Jackson Manor's
as guilty of killing Lester

38:03.649 --> 38:04.916
as if he put the knife
in himself.

38:04.950 --> 38:05.917
STABLER:
Kevin, thank you.

38:05.951 --> 38:09.888
I promise you,
we're going to make this right.

38:09.921 --> 38:11.990
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

38:12.023 --> 38:13.592
Can I ask
you something?

38:13.625 --> 38:14.826
Yes.

38:14.860 --> 38:16.362
When I moved out of there,

38:16.395 --> 38:18.430
they wouldn't let me
take my things,

38:18.464 --> 38:21.700
and in my room I had a really
nice photo of my son Tate.

38:21.733 --> 38:24.436
Could you just bring it to me?

38:24.470 --> 38:28.006
You got it.

38:32.911 --> 38:34.713
STABLER:
No security.
Anyone could walk in here.

38:34.746 --> 38:36.448
Yeah, or out.

38:36.482 --> 38:37.849
A health facility
and they're smoking?

38:37.883 --> 38:38.750
Who's going
to stop them?

38:38.784 --> 38:40.786
Who's going to put
this guy's pants on?

38:40.819 --> 38:42.521
You got nobody
supervising these people.

38:42.554 --> 38:44.089
Except her.
She's handing out meds.

38:44.122 --> 38:45.123
She must work here.

38:45.156 --> 38:46.992
Tomlinson.

38:47.025 --> 38:48.427
Tomlinson.

38:48.460 --> 38:51.530
Police. We need to see
Kevin Walker's records.

38:51.563 --> 38:54.966
( speaking Russian )

38:55.000 --> 38:57.035
She don't speak English.

38:57.068 --> 38:58.670
Of course she doesn't,

38:58.704 --> 39:01.607
but she's passing out
the medication.

39:01.640 --> 39:03.542
Actually, this is exactly
what I'm looking for.

39:03.575 --> 39:04.576
Thank you.

39:04.610 --> 39:05.577
MAN:
Put that down.

39:05.611 --> 39:06.978
Those records are confidential.

39:07.012 --> 39:08.814
Excuse me.
Who are you?

39:08.847 --> 39:10.916
Randall Haber, the owner.

39:10.949 --> 39:13.685
Mr. Haber, this is
a binding consent

39:13.719 --> 39:16.755
signed by Kevin Walker
and his attorney

39:16.788 --> 39:18.123
permitting us to
see his records.

39:18.156 --> 39:19.758
Why don't you
stand there and read it.

39:19.791 --> 39:22.594
It says here that
Kevin Walker was given

39:22.628 --> 39:26.031
ten milligrams
of olanzapine before
bedtime last night.

39:26.064 --> 39:27.899
Mr. Haber, we find that
really very funny

39:27.933 --> 39:30.135
because Mr. Walker
hasn't lived here in a year.

39:31.903 --> 39:32.771
I don't know how this happened.

39:32.804 --> 39:34.105
BENSON:
Sure you don't.

39:34.139 --> 39:35.841
Why don't you put
your hands behind
your back,

39:35.874 --> 39:37.443
since you're under
arrest for fraud.

39:37.476 --> 39:38.710
You're making a mistake.

39:38.744 --> 39:40.746
My wife is on
the city council.

39:40.779 --> 39:42.614
Really? That's great.
I'll tell you what.

39:42.648 --> 39:43.915
We're going to make
a phone call,

39:43.949 --> 39:45.150
see if she wants
to join you

39:45.183 --> 39:47.853
when we parade your sorry ass
in front of the TV cameras.

39:49.921 --> 39:51.890
I didn't even know
Kevin Walker was gone.

39:51.923 --> 39:54.059
NOVAK:
Your administrator's
going to testify

39:54.092 --> 39:56.828
that you ordered her to keep
Kevin on the books

39:56.862 --> 39:59.531
so you could get his money
from the State.

39:59.565 --> 40:01.600
Those people are no longer
your own

40:01.633 --> 40:03.034
personal cash cows.

40:03.068 --> 40:04.803
MAN:
That's enough.

40:04.836 --> 40:05.871
You think you have a case,

40:05.904 --> 40:07.573
charge him
so he can make bail.

40:07.606 --> 40:09.475
Fine.

40:14.813 --> 40:15.814
What the hell is this?

40:15.847 --> 40:17.015
STABLER:
Randall Haber,

40:17.048 --> 40:18.750
you're now under arrest
for the murders

40:18.784 --> 40:20.185
of Lester Hale
and Martha Davis.

40:20.218 --> 40:22.153
Murder?

40:22.187 --> 40:24.756
Martha Davis committed suicide.

40:24.790 --> 40:26.825
STABLER:
We exhumed her body.

40:26.858 --> 40:28.694
She died of severe
heat stroke.

40:28.727 --> 40:29.861
Because you told them

40:29.895 --> 40:31.830
not to turn on
her air-conditioning.

40:31.863 --> 40:33.865
A jury's going
to believe him?

40:33.899 --> 40:36.468
He murdered that grocer
in cold blood.

40:36.502 --> 40:38.203
STABLER:
Which only happened

40:38.236 --> 40:39.971
because you withheld
his medication

40:40.005 --> 40:41.873
and kicked him out
on the street.

40:41.907 --> 40:44.510
That makes you responsible
for Lester Hale's death.

40:44.543 --> 40:45.677
Okay...

40:45.711 --> 40:47.913
one count of Man Two with
a sentencing recommendation.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.981
Are you crazy?
I'm not making a deal.

40:50.015 --> 40:51.683
KEVIN:
Why did you tell

40:51.717 --> 40:53.018
the aide to cut Martha's wrists?

40:53.051 --> 40:54.553
I heard you.

40:54.586 --> 40:56.588
He doesn't know
what he heard.

40:56.622 --> 40:58.590
He's a mental patient.

40:58.624 --> 41:00.992
NOVAK:
He's back
on his medication.

41:01.026 --> 41:04.763
He's perfectly lucid,
and he's our star witness.

41:04.796 --> 41:06.264
Two counts, Man One,
concurrent.

41:06.297 --> 41:08.934
He does his 15.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.235
15 years?

41:10.268 --> 41:15.774
That or a jury can sentence
you to 25 to life.

41:15.807 --> 41:18.109
It's your choice.

41:24.082 --> 41:34.125
A deal.

41:34.125 --> 41:43.869
A deal.

41:43.902 --> 41:45.737
How are you doing?

41:45.771 --> 41:48.640
I'm okay.

41:48.674 --> 41:49.875
Good.

41:49.908 --> 41:51.710
You found my picture?

41:51.743 --> 41:54.680
Uh, no. I'm sorry.
They tossed everything.

41:54.713 --> 41:56.782
I did get you
a camera, though.

41:56.815 --> 41:58.684
What's that for?

42:05.691 --> 42:07.626
I brought him to see
how great

42:07.659 --> 42:08.660
his father's doing.

42:13.965 --> 42:16.635
It's okay, Tate. Say hello.

42:20.271 --> 42:21.607
Hello, Daddy.

42:21.640 --> 42:23.642
( chuckles )

42:23.675 --> 42:26.878
Hey, hey...
hey, Tate.

42:26.912 --> 42:28.313
Hi.

42:30.616 --> 42:32.017
How you doing?

42:32.050 --> 42:34.319
Good.

42:34.352 --> 42:36.087
I missed you.

42:36.121 --> 42:38.890
I missed you, too, Dad.

42:38.924 --> 42:41.993
I missed you
very, very much.
