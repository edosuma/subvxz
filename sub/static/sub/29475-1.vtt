20:58.725 --> 21:00.925
I forgot to put
the bloody pie in.

21:00.927 --> 21:01.993
[exhales]

21:01.995 --> 21:03.561
Can't you microwave it?

21:03.563 --> 21:04.729
We don't have a microwave.

21:04.731 --> 21:05.696
They're bad for you.

21:06.366 --> 21:07.598
I couldn't live without mine.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.033
It'll kill all the nutrients.

21:09.035 --> 21:12.470
So what are we going
to do for nutrients?

21:12.472 --> 21:14.005
It's nine o'clock already.

21:14.607 --> 21:15.539
Where's Bee?

21:15.541 --> 21:17.541
-She went to bed.
-Jet-lag.

21:17.543 --> 21:20.044
Where did you get
this wonderful smoked salmon?

21:20.046 --> 21:22.413
Fordham's Emergency Rations
thanks to Trent.

21:22.415 --> 21:24.782
I don't hear anybody
complaining.

21:24.784 --> 21:25.950
Oh, you like movies.

21:25.952 --> 21:27.985
Oh, so what kind of movies?

21:29.856 --> 21:31.489
Why don't you start
with the nuts?

21:33.660 --> 21:34.725
Horrible movies.

21:34.727 --> 21:35.726
Horrible movies.

21:35.728 --> 21:36.661
I think she means horror movies.

21:39.399 --> 21:41.432
-[all] Oh!
-Oh, finally.

21:41.434 --> 21:43.401
-Dan, darling, come and eat.
-That is huge.

21:44.404 --> 21:45.987
This is Soon.

21:45.988 --> 21:47.571
She's on an exchange visit
with Bee learning English.

21:48.441 --> 21:49.907
Oh, hello, Soon.

21:49.909 --> 21:50.908
Hello.

21:50.910 --> 21:51.842
[Dan] Welcome.

21:52.779 --> 21:54.095
[sighs]

21:54.096 --> 21:55.412
Are you okay? Was it terrible?

21:55.415 --> 21:56.547
No, it was fun.

21:56.549 --> 21:58.049
Haven't laughed so much
in years.

21:58.851 --> 21:59.950
[whispering] Here we go.

22:02.322 --> 22:05.056
For Father Christmas,
in case he gets hungry.

22:05.058 --> 22:06.991
Night-night.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.893
See you in the morning.

22:16.969 --> 22:18.703
Oh, what?

22:18.705 --> 22:20.638
Come on, guys, it's past 11.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.606
Mom says you have
to go to sleep.

22:22.608 --> 22:24.442
Otherwise, Father Christmas
won't come.

22:24.444 --> 22:26.377
[video game sounds playing]

22:26.379 --> 22:28.846
Tyler, please, switch it off.

22:28.848 --> 22:30.815
It's almost over.

22:32.118 --> 22:35.086
Don't make me scream.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.097
Dan.

22:47.567 --> 22:48.632
[knocking on the door]

22:52.004 --> 22:54.038
Oh, man, I am so sorry.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.673
I was completely out of line.

22:55.675 --> 22:57.708
It's okay, Trent. All forgotten.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.277
Can we drink to that?

22:59.278 --> 23:00.845
I hope you don't mind
I opened a bottle of cognac.

23:00.847 --> 23:02.646
Oh, <i> mi casa, su ca--</i>

23:03.816 --> 23:06.584
I guess now's
a good a time as any.

23:06.586 --> 23:08.652
1962.

23:08.654 --> 23:10.521
Miranda's father left it
for me in his will.

23:10.523 --> 23:11.722
Cool.

23:11.724 --> 23:12.857
You online?

23:12.859 --> 23:14.992
Still down, I'm afraid.

23:14.994 --> 23:16.093
Cheers!

23:18.965 --> 23:20.431
[grunts]

23:21.401 --> 23:22.833
So what's it like living here?

23:22.835 --> 23:24.402
Oh, it's great.

23:24.404 --> 23:25.569
It's great.

23:25.571 --> 23:27.805
Kids go to a really good
local school.

23:27.807 --> 23:28.806
We don't go out.

23:28.808 --> 23:29.807
Don't buy clothes.

23:29.809 --> 23:30.908
Life is so much simpler.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.643
I'd go nuts.

23:32.645 --> 23:34.028
Do you miss London?

23:34.029 --> 23:35.412
Don't you miss
being an architect?

23:35.815 --> 23:36.981
Well, not really.

23:38.117 --> 23:40.418
Well, yes, a bit.

23:40.420 --> 23:42.086
But if we can get
the B and B going...

23:42.088 --> 23:44.922
and the organic vegetable
business, and the farm shop...

23:44.924 --> 23:46.991
Organic vegetables.

23:46.993 --> 23:48.559
Oh, man.

23:49.462 --> 23:52.530
Well, I-- I may be able to get
something around here,

23:52.532 --> 23:54.999
open a small practice,
work from home.

23:55.735 --> 23:57.535
With no internet?

23:57.537 --> 24:00.070
[screaming]

24:01.741 --> 24:02.807
What the hell was that?

24:02.808 --> 24:03.874
Just Vicky putting
the kids to bed.

24:03.876 --> 24:08.512
[mysterious Christmas music
plays]

24:20.860 --> 24:24.094
Listen, Dan, I know
you never really liked me.

24:24.096 --> 24:26.931
-No, that's not true.
-It's okay.

24:26.933 --> 24:28.933
As long as we're still married
to these two chicks,

24:28.935 --> 24:30.201
we're stuck with each other.

24:30.203 --> 24:33.137
So what I'm about to say

24:33.139 --> 24:35.639
is from the best of motives.

24:36.042 --> 24:37.641
The point, Trent?

24:38.578 --> 24:40.211
The point is

24:40.213 --> 24:42.713
I think you've made
a terrible mistake

24:43.950 --> 24:45.483
moving here,

24:45.485 --> 24:47.218
taking on this house,

24:47.220 --> 24:50.221
all of the unresolved issues.

24:50.223 --> 24:51.555
What issues?

24:51.557 --> 24:52.823
What are you talking about?

24:52.825 --> 24:55.192
Nothing.

24:55.194 --> 24:57.161
I just think you're both
gonna die of boredom

24:57.163 --> 24:59.063
stuck out here in the country.

25:00.233 --> 25:01.599
Just because you and Lyla
can't stand

25:01.601 --> 25:02.733
to be alone for five minutes.

25:02.735 --> 25:04.235
-Now steady.
-The point is, Trent,

25:04.237 --> 25:05.936
I wasn't happy.

25:05.938 --> 25:07.204
We weren't happy.

25:07.206 --> 25:09.206
Struggling to make ends meet.

25:09.208 --> 25:10.641
Then there's
the kids' education.

25:10.643 --> 25:12.543
There's no way
we could afford to go private.

25:12.545 --> 25:15.179
Life is so much better for them
here in the country.

25:15.181 --> 25:17.548
Happy. What's happy?

25:17.550 --> 25:18.749
God, I don't know.

25:19.118 --> 25:20.184
You know when you're not.

25:20.186 --> 25:21.819
I'll tell you happy.

25:21.821 --> 25:23.287
Happy's a flame-red Porsche.

25:23.289 --> 25:25.006
[chuckles]

25:25.007 --> 25:26.724
Happy is watching your kid
hit a home run.

25:26.726 --> 25:30.861
-Happy is a nice pair of...
-There you are.

25:30.863 --> 25:32.196
-...shoes.
-Dan, they are sleep.

25:32.198 --> 25:34.031
Oh, we don't have to.

25:35.668 --> 25:37.735
If you don't want to,
Trent will. Won't you, Trent?

25:38.137 --> 25:39.937
Sure.
Does it matter if I'm Jewish?

25:39.939 --> 25:41.071
I'll do it.

25:42.174 --> 25:44.074
Thank you. Ho ho ho.

25:44.076 --> 25:44.942
Ha ha ha.

25:44.944 --> 25:46.544
[laughs]

25:46.546 --> 25:47.945
Oh.

25:47.947 --> 25:52.583
[quiet Christmas music plays]

26:18.978 --> 26:20.344
What's that?

26:21.347 --> 26:22.846
It's Tyler's stocking.

26:24.016 --> 26:26.317
Are you insane?
What are the twins gonna say?

26:27.086 --> 26:29.219
I don't know.
What are they gonna say?

26:29.221 --> 26:30.254
They're gonna say,
"How come Father Christmas

26:30.256 --> 26:31.622
doesn't love us
as much as Tyler."

26:31.624 --> 26:33.140
That's what they're gonna say.

26:33.141 --> 26:34.657
Don't tell me they still
believe in Santa Claus.

26:34.660 --> 26:36.961
Yes, they do.
Can't you tone it down a bit?

26:36.963 --> 26:38.762
And not give Tyler his presents?

26:39.231 --> 26:40.698
Well, maybe not all of them.

26:40.700 --> 26:41.966
All at once.

26:41.968 --> 26:44.602
Can't you put some of them
under the tree or...?

26:44.604 --> 26:46.236
Obviously, you haven't seen
under the tree.

26:47.239 --> 26:49.840
-What, there's more?
-Don't blame me. Blame Lyla.

26:49.842 --> 26:51.175
This is just the tip
of the iceberg.

26:51.177 --> 26:52.643
[whispering]
Can you keep it down?

26:52.645 --> 26:53.778
You'll wake up everyone up.

26:53.779 --> 26:54.912
I've got a problem
with the presents.

26:56.983 --> 27:00.184
Lyla, can you come here
for a second, please?

27:00.786 --> 27:03.120
I just think
it's unfair on our kids.

27:03.122 --> 27:04.855
You can give Tyler
whatever you want

27:04.857 --> 27:06.824
in the privacy of your own home.

27:08.027 --> 27:10.928
Why don't you just put more
in the twin's stockings?

27:10.930 --> 27:13.397
Then we won't have anything
on Christmas Day.

27:14.033 --> 27:15.199
Well, what do you want me to do?

27:15.201 --> 27:17.167
Give Tyler's presents
to the twins?

27:17.169 --> 27:18.302
Of course, not.

27:18.304 --> 27:20.638
I just don't want it
to look so obvious

27:20.640 --> 27:22.940
in the morning
when they wake up.

27:22.942 --> 27:24.341
I'm sure Tyler won't mind

27:24.343 --> 27:25.976
getting
a few of his presents later,

27:25.978 --> 27:27.711
something to look forward to.

27:27.713 --> 27:29.113
Fine, whatever.

27:29.115 --> 27:31.115
Honey, why don't you Polaroid
the ones you take out

27:31.117 --> 27:33.350
and put in his stocking
in case he gets disappointed?

27:34.020 --> 27:35.136
Well, that's a good idea.

27:35.137 --> 27:36.253
That's actually
a very good idea.

27:36.255 --> 27:38.122
Do you know what?
I am going to bed.

27:38.124 --> 27:40.224
You sort it out.

27:40.226 --> 27:41.725
Well,
what about midnight carols?

27:41.727 --> 27:44.245
I promised the Vicar.

27:44.246 --> 27:46.764
Oh, my God, that really is in
the above and beyond category.

27:48.401 --> 27:50.968
Goodnight, everyone. Are you...?

27:50.970 --> 27:52.403
I'll be up in a bit, hon.

to London in the morning.

I always go around
on Christmas Day,

open Harry's presents with him.

30:25.891 --> 30:27.090
It's slightly different.

Now we're not living in London.

I'm not gonna start

That's not the point.

30:33.365 --> 30:35.199
He's not in a good way.

30:35.201 --> 30:36.900
I dropped by with his presents,

30:36.902 --> 30:39.002
and he was still in bed
at six o'clock.

30:39.004 --> 30:42.005
You went to Miriam's.
No wonder you were so late.

-Really.
-Yeah.

Not a good idea.

32:30.950 --> 32:35.185
Good evening, sir.
Do you know a Mr. Malinowski?

32:35.955 --> 32:37.721
I'm not sure.

32:37.723 --> 32:41.525
Well, how about
a Mr. Wino Brodsky?

32:53.105 --> 32:55.205
Bee, what the hell
are you doing here?

32:59.745 --> 33:02.346
[slurred] I real sorry, Dan.

33:10.255 --> 33:12.389
[mumbles]

33:20.466 --> 33:22.299
Watch on your toe.

33:24.336 --> 33:26.436
[grunts]

33:29.008 --> 33:32.509
-Oh, I'm warming up.
-Brilliant.

33:38.317 --> 33:39.583
[retches]

33:43.155 --> 33:45.188
-Please don't tell my dad!
-Shh.

33:45.190 --> 33:46.123
[steps coming closer]

33:46.125 --> 33:48.525
[Lyla snores]

33:48.527 --> 33:49.726
Lyla.

33:49.728 --> 33:51.261
They'll send me
to one of those camps

33:51.263 --> 33:53.163
where they leave you
in the desert with nothing

33:53.165 --> 33:54.264
but a canvas and a penknife.

33:54.266 --> 33:55.766
-Wake up.
-What? What?

33:55.768 --> 33:57.667
-[screams]
-[screams]

33:58.737 --> 34:01.671
[Bobo barks]

34:01.673 --> 34:03.440
Are you all--

34:03.442 --> 34:05.742
Are you my stocking
present, darling?

34:05.744 --> 34:08.779
[Bobo barks]

34:08.781 --> 34:11.281
Oh, hey, Dad. What's up?

34:11.283 --> 34:12.749
[Bobo barks]

34:12.751 --> 34:16.153
[laughs]

34:16.155 --> 34:17.354
-I think we should--
-Go back to bed.

34:17.356 --> 34:18.488
We'll just leave you to it.

34:18.490 --> 34:19.423
[Dan laughs]

34:19.425 --> 34:20.524
[Bobo grunts]

34:20.526 --> 34:21.458
[Bobo barks]

34:28.300 --> 34:32.402
-Wow! A Frisbee. I love that.
-It's amazing.

34:34.640 --> 34:35.806
Cool.

34:37.810 --> 34:40.277
[car engine chokes]

34:43.282 --> 34:45.682
[car engine starts]

34:48.353 --> 34:50.587
Now you begin to see
what I have to put up with.

34:50.589 --> 34:52.255
Oh, come on, he got drunk.

34:52.257 --> 34:53.290
It's Christmas.

34:53.292 --> 34:54.758
No, you don't understand.

34:54.760 --> 34:56.760
Trent gets drunk every night.

34:56.762 --> 34:58.562
He's an alcoholic.

34:58.563 --> 35:00.363
How could he hold out
such a high-powered job

35:00.365 --> 35:01.264
if he was an alcoholic?

35:01.266 --> 35:02.566
Trent got fired.

35:02.568 --> 35:04.134
He doesn't have a job.

35:04.136 --> 35:05.435
What?

35:05.437 --> 35:07.637
He was losing clients
left, right and center.

35:07.639 --> 35:09.739
The agency agreed to keep him on

35:09.741 --> 35:11.508
if he could stay sober
for six months.

35:11.510 --> 35:13.677
He couldn't manage six days.

35:14.279 --> 35:16.146
Poor Trent. I'm so sorry.

35:16.882 --> 35:18.615
His mother founded
the agency, didn't she?

35:18.617 --> 35:20.350
I know. It's humiliating.

35:20.752 --> 35:23.687
I mean, when she asked
about managing to keep afloat

35:23.689 --> 35:26.389
on my earnings from the show,

35:26.391 --> 35:28.525
but if the series
doesn't get renewed...

35:28.527 --> 35:30.861
-When did this happen?
-September.

35:30.863 --> 35:32.562
He's been hoping
to get Soon's father

35:32.564 --> 35:35.165
to invest in this movie fund

35:35.167 --> 35:36.766
he's hoping to put together.

35:36.768 --> 35:39.603
-Really?
-Apparently he's a billionaire.

35:39.605 --> 35:42.472
His company builds
half the sewers in China and--

35:42.474 --> 35:45.308
And now he wants to get involved
in the movie business.

35:45.310 --> 35:46.610
Oh, that would be good,
wouldn't it?

35:46.612 --> 35:48.478
Well, I'm not holding my breath.

35:48.480 --> 35:51.748
I mean, why would
he choose Trent, for God's sake?

35:51.750 --> 35:54.151
I had no idea
things were so bad.

35:54.153 --> 35:55.285
The point is...

35:55.287 --> 35:57.287
is that I'm thinking

35:57.289 --> 35:58.755
of moving back here

35:58.757 --> 36:01.358
to live without Trent.

36:01.360 --> 36:02.559
Gosh.

36:02.561 --> 36:06.763
Well, it's assuming that
the series doesn't get renewed.

36:06.765 --> 36:08.765
Let's pray that it does.

36:08.767 --> 36:10.567
Not that it wouldn't
be great to have you back

36:10.569 --> 36:11.768
from my selfish point of view.

36:11.770 --> 36:13.303
It's just that, you know,

36:13.305 --> 36:15.238
it's so complicated

36:15.240 --> 36:16.606
about where we live,

36:16.608 --> 36:17.874
the kids' schools.

36:17.876 --> 36:19.376
Well,

36:19.378 --> 36:21.378
you could always come back here.

36:21.380 --> 36:24.181
[laughing] I don't think
that would work.

36:24.183 --> 36:25.749
Can you imagine?

36:25.751 --> 36:28.285
Well, let's hope
it doesn't come to that.

36:30.222 --> 36:34.291
But we do need to talk
about Mom and Dad,

36:34.293 --> 36:36.526
about the will,
about everything.

36:37.629 --> 36:39.229
Okay.

36:41.200 --> 36:41.898
Fire away.

36:41.900 --> 36:44.568
Just not now.

36:44.569 --> 36:47.237
I mean, I'm sorry
that I brought it up, but...

36:47.239 --> 36:48.772
[sighs]

36:48.774 --> 36:50.273
I have to go and get dressed.

36:50.275 --> 36:52.409
It's going to be a busy day.

36:53.845 --> 36:55.212
Love you.

37:07.292 --> 37:08.525
[doorbell rings]

37:13.432 --> 37:14.364
Happy Christmas.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.333
Happy Christmas.

37:19.371 --> 37:20.270
Sorry I'm late.

37:20.272 --> 37:21.404
Is he up yet?

37:21.406 --> 37:23.840
He's lying down on the sofa.

37:27.846 --> 37:29.312
Hey, Harry.

37:29.314 --> 37:30.013
Happy Christmas.

37:30.015 --> 37:30.981
Hey.

37:30.983 --> 37:32.415
What's up?

37:32.417 --> 37:34.451
What are you doing?

37:34.453 --> 37:38.588
I'm experiencing myself
as inert matter.

37:39.258 --> 37:40.790
Well, that shouldn't
be too difficult.

37:41.793 --> 37:42.859
Sorry, bad joke.

37:44.496 --> 37:45.695
Are you all right?

37:47.566 --> 37:48.698
Who are you?

37:48.700 --> 37:52.836
Oh, come on, for God's sake,
I'm here to open your presents.

37:53.905 --> 37:56.673
How do I know
you're not a machine

37:56.675 --> 37:58.775
that's pretending
to be my father?

37:59.411 --> 38:00.677
Harry, if you're trying
to scare me,

38:00.679 --> 38:01.978
you're doing a really good job.

38:03.415 --> 38:04.681
Bee, darling.

38:04.683 --> 38:08.285
Could you be an angel
and peel some sprouts?

38:08.287 --> 38:10.620
Potatoes. Peel some potatoes.

38:10.622 --> 38:13.356
Oh, sure.

38:13.358 --> 38:15.592
Okay. This...

38:15.594 --> 38:17.460
I mean...

38:19.798 --> 38:21.031

-All right.

-Aim higher, Dylan. Fire!

38:35.947 --> 38:37.681

Quick. In here.

38:40.485 --> 38:41.618
Get behind the curtain.

38:41.620 --> 38:43.520
[Tyler] I'm coming for you.

38:45.857 --> 38:47.490
Who's that?

38:47.893 --> 38:48.825

39:04.042 --> 39:05.408

now the bloody gas has gone out.

-[Vicky] Oh, no. You're joking.
-Hello?

39:30.836 --> 39:33.136
Doesn't anyone answer
the bloody phone in that house?

39:33.138 --> 39:35.572

lunch, or at least trying to.

and everyone is talking at once.

-Yes, that's better.

a massive freak-out.

40:02.033 --> 40:03.500
What do you mean?

40:03.502 --> 40:04.667
He's just gunk.

40:04.669 --> 40:06.069
He's completely psychotic.

40:06.071 --> 40:07.137
He thinks I'm a machine.

40:07.139 --> 40:09.572
Oh, I thought
he'd that given up.

40:09.574 --> 40:10.740
[Dan] <i> I know.</i>

We're trying
to get him into a clinic.

40:12.110 --> 40:13.977
His therapist is on a case now.

I don't know
what time I'll be back.

for you to open the presents.

-What? Don't be silly.

40:20.619 --> 40:22.886
-She's making groaning noises.
-She's almost dead.

Gone. Departed.

41:00.759 --> 41:02.125
Are you sure?

41:02.127 --> 41:03.626
Dan, they are gone.

41:03.628 --> 41:05.528
We are a Pole-free zone.

41:05.530 --> 41:07.530
They must have panicked
after the arrest.

41:07.532 --> 41:10.066
So now the oven's blown out,
and I've got no one to fix it.

How am I gonna cook Gobbles?

Well, it can't all be done.

I suppose you know
what you're doing.

43:32.677 --> 43:33.943
I'll have that, too, please.

43:34.346 --> 43:36.846
-My phone?
-[nurse] Yes, please.

43:36.848 --> 43:38.881
No, but I can't--
I can't sleep without it.

43:38.883 --> 43:40.016
Can't you make an exception?

43:40.018 --> 43:41.651
It's not like it's a pill

43:41.653 --> 43:42.785
or a drug or anything.

43:43.388 --> 43:45.922
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't.

43:45.924 --> 43:47.357
I'd have to have it
safety-checked

43:47.359 --> 43:49.292
by an electrician.

43:49.294 --> 43:51.194
Well, okay, check it then.

43:51.796 --> 43:54.697
Mr. Reid, it's Christmas Day.

43:54.699 --> 43:55.865
[laughs]

43:55.867 --> 43:57.266
I'm glad you think it's funny.

43:57.268 --> 44:00.069
Please don't raise your voice,
Mr. Reid.

44:00.071 --> 44:01.170
I'm not raising my voice.

44:01.172 --> 44:03.139
This is raising my voice!

44:04.109 --> 44:05.975
Is everything okay in here?

44:05.977 --> 44:08.211
Would you take the patient
through, please?

44:08.213 --> 44:10.647
If you'd just follow me, sir,
and if you'd come along quietly.

44:10.649 --> 44:11.848
Not me, for God's sakes.

44:11.850 --> 44:13.116
My son.

44:13.118 --> 44:17.687
[upbeat classical music]

44:43.381 --> 44:45.682
Mommy, mommy,
the Popemobile is here.

44:45.684 --> 44:46.949
Oh, God. What time is it?

44:49.320 --> 44:52.922
Uncle John! Oh!

44:54.426 --> 44:55.925
Happy Christmas!

44:55.927 --> 44:58.294
Lyla, my darling,
lovely as ever.

44:58.296 --> 45:00.363
Oh, if only that were true.

45:00.965 --> 45:03.866
This is David, everybody,
my personal assistant.

45:03.868 --> 45:06.302
-Hello, David.
-Uncle John! You're early.

45:06.304 --> 45:08.938
No, my dear, I'm on time.

45:10.809 --> 45:14.277
In this house, that probably
means you're 24 hours too early.

45:14.279 --> 45:16.713
Trent, I'm so glad
you could make it.

45:16.715 --> 45:17.880
[Bobo barks]

45:17.882 --> 45:19.282
John! Johnny!

45:19.284 --> 45:21.284
How wonderful you're here.

45:21.286 --> 45:23.419
Peggy, what a lovely surprise.

45:23.421 --> 45:26.222
Hardly. I'm here every year.
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

45:26.224 --> 45:27.790
Come in, come in.

45:27.792 --> 45:29.158
You're gonna do it, David.

45:29.160 --> 45:30.159
Here we go.

45:30.161 --> 45:32.095
Love your socks.

45:32.097 --> 45:33.396
Love your clothes.

45:33.398 --> 45:38.501
[reporter] <i> ...come together</i>
<i> in celebration of the year...</i>

45:38.503 --> 45:40.169
That's disgusting.

45:40.171 --> 45:42.371
It just had one big lump.

45:43.174 --> 45:44.941
I hate to ask,
but how soon is lunch?

45:45.877 --> 45:47.944
You know how Mr. Fitzgerald
has to have his meals on time.

45:48.780 --> 45:49.879
[sighs]

46:00.024 --> 46:01.324
[grunts]

46:02.327 --> 46:04.260
[grunts]

46:05.330 --> 46:07.330
Okay. Okay.

46:07.932 --> 46:10.800
[TV playing in the background]

46:17.075 --> 46:18.441
Potatoes are done!

46:20.111 --> 46:22.345
All right.
Let's get everyone to sit down.

46:22.347 --> 46:24.147
-[Vicky] Looking good.
-I'm sorry, we've got to eat.

46:24.149 --> 46:26.082
He's about to go
low blood sugar on me.

46:29.921 --> 46:31.087
Lunch is ready.

46:31.089 --> 46:32.789
Oh.

46:32.791 --> 46:34.023
Oh, God.

46:41.166 --> 46:42.799
Is he dead?

46:42.801 --> 46:44.267
He's fine.

46:44.269 --> 46:46.102
He just needs his medication.

46:55.113 --> 46:57.346
Did I miss anything?

46:57.348 --> 46:58.981
Lunch, for example?

47:16.000 --> 47:18.034
Everybody is starving.

47:18.036 --> 47:19.202
We almost lost Uncle John.

47:19.204 --> 47:21.070
He went low blood sugar on us.

47:21.072 --> 47:22.972
[Dan] <i> I'll be there</i>
<i> in ten minutes.</i>

47:22.974 --> 47:24.106
[Miranda] Hurry.

47:24.108 --> 47:25.942
[Dan]
<i> I'm going as fast as I can.</i>

47:25.944 --> 47:26.976
<i> Start without me.</i>

47:26.978 --> 47:29.312
No, just get here.

47:29.314 --> 47:32.615
Everybody please sit down
before it gets cold.

47:33.885 --> 47:36.853
-[Daisy] I'm starving.
-[Miranda] I know.

47:38.189 --> 47:40.923
I don't know.

47:40.925 --> 47:42.291
I'm sorry, we're waiting
for him still.

47:42.293 --> 47:43.192
It's getting late.

47:43.194 --> 47:45.428
Oh, it's Dan.

47:45.430 --> 47:46.295
[Bobo barks]

47:46.297 --> 47:47.530
Finally, Dan is here.

47:47.532 --> 47:48.965
I'm starv--

47:48.967 --> 47:50.633
-Trent. Trent.
-Is he here?

47:54.105 --> 47:55.338
Honey, how was it?

47:55.340 --> 47:56.305
Terrible.

47:56.307 --> 47:57.273
Truly awful.

47:57.275 --> 47:58.608
I'm sorry.

47:58.610 --> 48:00.610
Poor Harry.

48:00.612 --> 48:02.529
You're just in time to carve.

48:02.530 --> 48:04.447
-Thought you were ruthless.
-I'm sorry, I really am.

48:04.449 --> 48:05.982
We'll talk about it later.

48:05.984 --> 48:08.584
But we've got a houseful
of starving guests.

48:08.586 --> 48:10.887
-All right.
[Miranda] Come on.

48:13.157 --> 48:15.892
Sorry, everybody. Sorry.

48:15.894 --> 48:17.927
Daddy, Daddy, when are we going
to open the presents?

48:17.929 --> 48:20.162
Not now, Daisy. As soon
as we finish lunch, I promise.

48:20.164 --> 48:22.148
-[Daisy] But it's night time.
-Hello, Uncle John.

48:22.149 --> 48:24.133
For God's sake, come and get
something to eat, dear boy.

48:25.103 --> 48:26.369
Where is Soon?

48:26.370 --> 48:27.636
[Bee] Oh,
she didn't feel like eating.

48:27.639 --> 48:29.171
You don't say.

48:29.173 --> 48:31.140
-All right.
-[Miranda] Ho ho.

48:31.142 --> 48:32.942
Yes, indeed.

48:32.944 --> 48:34.911
Okay, where is the bird?

48:34.913 --> 48:36.646
[knives clinking]

48:36.648 --> 48:39.048
Coming. I'm sorry it's late.
I-- It's--

48:39.050 --> 48:41.250
What happened to--
to-- to the turkey?

48:41.252 --> 48:43.185
-Don't even go there.
-[Bobby] I'm not hungry anymore.

48:43.187 --> 48:44.921
Please tell me
that's not a turkey.

48:44.923 --> 48:46.923
-Gobbles?
-Yeah.

48:46.925 --> 48:48.357
Darling, that's
what happens to turkeys.

48:48.359 --> 48:49.525
We always knew.

48:49.527 --> 48:50.493
You killed Gobbles.

48:50.495 --> 48:51.394
-What?
-Ow!

48:51.396 --> 48:52.628
I hate you.

48:52.630 --> 48:53.629
Daisy, stop it!

48:53.631 --> 48:55.331
Right, that does it.

48:55.332 --> 48:57.032
I am so sick of being
the bad guy in this house.

48:57.035 --> 48:59.001
[Daisy] Ow,
you're pulling my hair.

48:59.003 --> 49:00.937

<i> child abuse </i> ¶

49:00.939 --> 49:02.088
Boys.

49:02.089 --> 49:03.238
I'm just going to have
a little talk with Daisy,

49:03.241 --> 49:04.573
explain
some of the facts of life.

49:04.575 --> 49:06.042
[Bobby] What does that mean?

49:07.445 --> 49:09.712
Daddy, where are we going?

49:09.714 --> 49:11.080
It's a surprise.

49:14.185 --> 49:16.652
Daisy, can you keep a secret?

49:16.654 --> 49:18.287
I think so.

49:18.289 --> 49:20.723
You've got to promise me
not to say anything to Mommy.

49:20.725 --> 49:22.058
You mean lie?

49:22.060 --> 49:24.727
Yes, darling,
that's exactly what I mean.

49:27.098 --> 49:29.031
Here you go.

49:39.043 --> 49:40.109
[Gobbles gobbles]

49:40.111 --> 49:41.277
Jesus.

49:41.279 --> 49:42.345
Gobbles, Gobbles.

49:42.347 --> 49:43.713
I love you, Daddy.

49:43.715 --> 49:46.382
Not a word.
Not a word to anyone, okay?

49:46.384 --> 49:47.383
Okay, I promise.

49:47.385 --> 49:48.250
[Gobbles gobbles]

49:48.252 --> 49:49.385
[chink]

49:49.387 --> 49:52.021
If I may say a few words,

49:52.023 --> 49:53.522
I promise to be brief.

49:53.524 --> 49:54.657
[laughs]

49:55.760 --> 50:00.196
This is a sad occasion
and a happy one.

50:00.198 --> 50:03.332
Sad, because it's the first
Christmas in this house

50:03.334 --> 50:07.003
without Ron
and my dear sister June.

50:07.005 --> 50:11.607
Happy, because they would have
been so thrilled

50:11.609 --> 50:14.210
to see all the family
gathered here

50:14.212 --> 50:17.613
celebrating Christmas in
this house they loved so much.

50:17.615 --> 50:21.517
So, Dan and Miranda, thank you
for making this Christmas

50:21.519 --> 50:24.086
so special
with all your hard work.

50:24.088 --> 50:25.788
And, Lyla, Trent, thank you

50:25.790 --> 50:28.324
for making the long journey
to be with us today.

50:28.326 --> 50:29.892
[clears his throat]

50:29.893 --> 50:31.459
Call me a sentimental old fool,

50:31.462 --> 50:34.130
but it means so much to me

50:34.132 --> 50:37.266
to see your wonderful children
Bee and Tyler

50:37.268 --> 50:39.201
discovering their roots,

50:39.203 --> 50:42.238
bonding
with their English cousins.

50:42.240 --> 50:45.374
So it's been
a wonderful lunch, Miranda.

50:45.376 --> 50:49.311
As they say, all good things
come to he who waits.

50:49.313 --> 50:51.647
[all] Yeah!

50:51.649 --> 50:53.416
Good speech.

51:06.597 --> 51:09.832
But I got the house,
and you got the investments.

51:09.834 --> 51:12.535
That was what we agreed
with Mom and Dad.

51:12.537 --> 51:15.204
The will said that everything
should be equal.

51:15.206 --> 51:17.173
The investments have gone,
Miranda.

51:17.175 --> 51:18.207
What do you mean gone?

51:18.209 --> 51:20.076
There's nothing left.

51:20.078 --> 51:22.144
Can't you explain, Uncle John?

51:22.146 --> 51:23.412
Unfortunately,

51:23.414 --> 51:25.381
your father put all the money

51:25.383 --> 51:27.149
into one of those hedge funds.

51:27.151 --> 51:30.386
Now, I advised him against it
but, anyway...

51:30.388 --> 51:31.420
[clears his throat]

51:31.422 --> 51:33.355
The fund's been wiped out

51:33.357 --> 51:34.757
every penny.

51:34.759 --> 51:36.125
I'm really sorry,

51:36.127 --> 51:37.793
but we've put everything we have

51:37.795 --> 51:39.361
into this house,

51:39.363 --> 51:41.330
everything we got
from selling London.

51:41.332 --> 51:42.498
[scoffs]

51:42.500 --> 51:44.667
What do you expect me to say?

51:44.669 --> 51:46.135
I am in a crisis.

51:46.137 --> 51:47.603
My marriage is shit.

51:47.605 --> 51:49.405
My career's shit.

51:49.407 --> 51:50.739
[exhales]

51:50.741 --> 51:53.442
I need the money. I just do.

51:53.444 --> 51:56.378
Obviously, I'll pay back
everything that you've put in.

51:56.380 --> 51:59.115
What do you want us to do? Sell?

51:59.117 --> 52:02.751
This isn't just a house, Lyla,
it's our childhood.

52:02.753 --> 52:06.222
And I want it to be
my children's childhood, too.

52:06.224 --> 52:08.858
I know that doesn't mean
anything to you.

52:08.860 --> 52:10.893
Well, can't you take out a loan?

52:11.762 --> 52:13.562
We've already borrowed
up to the hill.

52:13.564 --> 52:15.898
The bank's calling
every other day.

52:15.900 --> 52:18.367
Well, I don't expect
to get paid right away.

52:18.369 --> 52:19.535
When, then?

52:20.438 --> 52:22.438
Oh, I don't know, six months?

52:23.474 --> 52:25.407
What? What would be
the situation

52:25.409 --> 52:28.277
if the investments have gone up
instead of down?

52:28.279 --> 52:29.395
[exhales]

52:29.396 --> 52:30.512
Would you be giving me
a share of the profits?

52:30.515 --> 52:32.248
So the answer's no?

52:32.250 --> 52:34.250
You're just gonna keep
everything for yourself.

52:34.252 --> 52:36.652
Oh, that is so unfair.

52:36.654 --> 52:38.454
You want us to move out
of our home,

52:38.456 --> 52:40.456
but you're the one we're
supposed to feel sorry for.

52:40.458 --> 52:43.292
Oh, God,
you're being ridiculous!

52:43.294 --> 52:46.362
I mean, this whole lifestyle,
who are you kidding, huh?

52:46.364 --> 52:48.664
I mean, look at you, no makeup,
your hair's a mess.

52:48.666 --> 52:50.082
[laughs]

52:50.083 --> 52:51.499
How long do you think Dan's
gonna stick around?

52:51.502 --> 52:52.868
He hates the bloody country.

52:52.870 --> 52:54.537
What would you know?

52:54.539 --> 52:56.305
You can't stand anyone else
being happy

52:56.307 --> 52:57.439
just because you're married

52:57.441 --> 52:59.308
to a raging alcoholic
drug addict.

52:59.310 --> 53:02.912
Girls, girls, this isn't
getting us anywhere.

53:02.914 --> 53:05.814
The thing is that Lyla
does have a point.

53:06.417 --> 53:09.585
The terms of the will
are quite explicit.

53:09.587 --> 53:12.321
The intention is
and always has been

53:12.323 --> 53:15.524
that you both end up
with an equal share.

53:15.526 --> 53:18.294
And, clearly,
that's no longer the case.

53:18.296 --> 53:21.363
I'm so pleased to see you,
Uncle John.

53:21.365 --> 53:22.498
[kids] We love you.

53:22.500 --> 53:24.200
We hope to see more of you
in the future.

53:24.202 --> 53:25.434
Bye!

53:25.436 --> 53:27.403
-[Daisy] See ya.
-[Miranda grunts]

53:27.405 --> 53:28.337
[Dan] Bye.

53:31.442 --> 53:32.308
Bye-bye.

53:32.310 --> 53:32.975
Goodbye!

53:32.977 --> 53:34.410
[grunts]

53:34.412 --> 53:35.811
Bye!

53:35.813 --> 53:36.745
[car engine starts]

53:38.516 --> 53:40.416
-Miranda?
-I don't think he can hear us.

53:40.418 --> 53:42.851
[all] Bye!

53:46.891 --> 53:47.756
[sighs]

53:47.758 --> 53:49.625
What an evening.

53:49.627 --> 53:50.993
I think we should go to bedroom.

53:50.995 --> 53:52.495
Okay.

53:52.496 --> 53:53.996
I don't know about you guys,
but I'm bushed.

53:53.998 --> 53:56.432
I'm gonna hit the sack.

53:56.434 --> 53:57.933
Come on, boys. Daisy, sleep.

53:57.935 --> 53:59.768
Even Uncle Trent
is going to bed now.

53:59.770 --> 54:01.403
What about the presents?

54:01.405 --> 54:02.771
No, it's far too late.

54:02.773 --> 54:04.023
You promised.

54:04.024 --> 54:05.274
We need to be up
for the match in the morning.

54:05.276 --> 54:06.286
Mom, it's not fair.

54:06.287 --> 54:07.297
Trent, you will play,
wouldn't you?

54:07.298 --> 54:08.308
Please take one to bed.

54:08.312 --> 54:10.446
-Soccer?
-That's really mean.

54:10.448 --> 54:11.947
We always play the village
on Boxing Day.

54:11.949 --> 54:14.416
Another of those quaint
old family traditions?

54:14.418 --> 54:16.452
Yeah, I'm afraid so.
We need you, pal.

54:16.454 --> 54:17.886
This is the worst
Christmas ever.

54:17.888 --> 54:19.788
And the Poles buggered off.
They took half our team.

54:19.790 --> 54:21.890
-The best half.
-Yeah.

54:23.427 --> 54:24.760
I mean, she went ballistic.

54:24.762 --> 54:26.662
She started yelling
at Uncle John.

54:26.664 --> 54:28.931
I've never seen her
so worked up.

54:28.933 --> 54:30.833
She sees the logic?

54:30.835 --> 54:33.002
It's not about logic, Trent.

54:33.004 --> 54:35.671
They spent all the money
from selling the house in London

54:35.673 --> 54:37.606
doing this place up.

54:37.608 --> 54:38.540
And it's still a wreck.

54:38.542 --> 54:41.343
They have a huge overdraft
and they think

54:41.345 --> 54:45.014
that they can make whole thing
work by selling vegetables.

54:45.016 --> 54:47.283
Don't forget the goat's milk.

54:47.285 --> 54:49.518
[laughs] Oh, stop.

54:49.520 --> 54:51.103
[Trent] It's insane.

54:51.104 --> 54:52.687
Dan doesn't even have
a job anymore.

54:52.690 --> 54:54.390
Well, that makes two of you.

54:55.926 --> 54:58.294
I mean, I feel
really bad about it,

54:58.296 --> 55:00.429
but, I mean,
what am I supposed to do?

55:02.500 --> 55:04.366
[Trent sighs]

55:22.053 --> 55:24.653
No, Trent,
I want to go to sleep.

55:24.655 --> 55:28.490
[Trent] Come on, baby, be nice.

55:28.492 --> 55:30.726
[Lyla] Did you just take Viagra?

55:30.728 --> 55:31.694
[Trent] No.

55:31.696 --> 55:32.995
[Lyla] I know you did.

55:32.997 --> 55:33.862
[Trent] Please.

55:33.864 --> 55:36.398
[Lyla] No means no, Trent.

55:36.400 --> 55:37.333
[Trent] It's Christmas.

55:42.006 --> 55:43.639
This is my favorite place,

55:43.641 --> 55:46.709
not just 'cause you can get
a frigging phone signal.

55:46.711 --> 55:48.010
Cool.

55:48.012 --> 55:50.479
Magic showed me.
It's our secret.

55:51.716 --> 55:53.582
But you can't tell anyone.

55:53.584 --> 55:55.117
Okay, I understand.

55:55.119 --> 55:56.352
Thanks.

55:57.054 --> 55:58.420
You gonna be okay?

55:58.422 --> 55:59.955
You-- you feeling better?

55:59.957 --> 56:01.957
Yes, I better now.

56:01.959 --> 56:03.592
Okay.

56:13.637 --> 56:17.072
[faucet running]

56:17.074 --> 56:19.141
[dishwasher starts running]

56:22.747 --> 56:25.814
Thanks, Vicks. You go to bed.
It's under control.

56:25.816 --> 56:28.450
Come on, you must have had
a hell of a day.

56:28.452 --> 56:30.386
Okay, you wash. I'll dry.

56:32.590 --> 56:35.724
You must be so worried
about Harry,

56:35.726 --> 56:38.127
stuck here in the country.

56:38.129 --> 56:40.529
Listen, do you want me
to have a word with him?

56:40.531 --> 56:43.665
I do know a thing or two
about substance abuse.

56:43.667 --> 56:46.402
Thanks. You know, I may
take you up on that, actually.

56:46.404 --> 56:48.570
And we're not stuck here,
by the way.

56:48.572 --> 56:51.540
We're here of her own free will,
believe it or not.

57:21.806 --> 57:23.138
[Dan sighs]

57:26.177 --> 57:27.476
[sighs]

57:29.046 --> 57:30.179
Dan.

57:30.181 --> 57:32.014
Oh, sorry,
I thought you were asleep.

57:32.817 --> 57:35.150
I've got some really bad news.

58:07.585 --> 58:09.618
Oh, my God, you scared me.

58:09.620 --> 58:10.986
I thought
everyone had gone to bed.

58:11.589 --> 58:13.822
I can't sleep.
I need some water.

58:13.824 --> 58:15.824
[slurred] Well, there's water
in the bathroom.

58:15.826 --> 58:16.992
Clean water.

58:16.993 --> 58:18.159
The water in the bathroom
is brown.

58:18.162 --> 58:19.194
No, thanks.

58:19.196 --> 58:21.129
It's from a well.

58:21.131 --> 58:22.664
Organic.

58:22.666 --> 58:23.765
Yeah?

58:23.767 --> 58:24.933
What if there's a dead rat

58:24.935 --> 58:26.502
in the water tank?

58:26.504 --> 58:27.903
There's only rat in this house,

58:27.905 --> 58:30.672
and he's very much alive.

58:31.075 --> 58:33.675
I think rats get bad PR.

58:33.677 --> 58:36.578
A rat never changes its spots.

58:36.981 --> 58:38.280
I think you mean a leopard.

58:38.282 --> 58:40.249
No, not, in this case, I don't.

58:40.851 --> 58:42.918
God, you look hot tonight.

58:42.920 --> 58:45.254
Can you let me by,
please, would you?

58:45.256 --> 58:46.889
What if I say no?

58:48.225 --> 58:49.892
I'll scream.

58:54.632 --> 58:57.099
And wake everybody up?

58:57.101 --> 58:59.067
[both pant]

58:59.069 --> 59:00.135
I mean it.

59:00.137 --> 59:01.970
Just a cuddle.

59:05.843 --> 59:09.144
Trent. No. No.

59:10.314 --> 59:11.914
Trent.

59:11.916 --> 59:13.549
No, no, no.

59:13.551 --> 59:15.717
We're getting too old
for this sort of thing.

59:15.719 --> 59:19.054
Speak for yourself.

59:19.056 --> 59:21.156
What about Lyla?

59:21.158 --> 59:23.125
Lyla doesn't care. She hates me.

59:31.001 --> 59:32.668
Houston, we have a problem.

59:32.670 --> 59:34.269
Not that much for a problem.

59:34.271 --> 59:37.139
Let's blast.

59:37.141 --> 59:38.840
-[gasps]
-Oh, shit.

59:38.842 --> 59:40.609
You bastard!

59:40.611 --> 59:42.144
I don't believe it.

59:42.146 --> 59:43.645
Get off me!

59:46.850 --> 59:48.016
I'm gonna need some ice.

59:48.619 --> 59:50.852
And what did Uncle John
actually say?

59:50.854 --> 59:53.922
Nothing.
He was completely on her side.

59:53.924 --> 59:55.691
She always was the favorite,

59:55.693 --> 59:58.760
the pretty one,
the clever one, the star.

59:58.762 --> 1:00:00.996
I mean, this is a disaster.

1:00:00.998 --> 1:00:02.998
We're totally screwed.

1:00:03.000 --> 1:00:05.100
I can't believe you didn't tell
me what it said in the will.

1:00:05.102 --> 1:00:08.203
Dan, I didn't know the fund
was going to go bust.

1:00:08.205 --> 1:00:09.771
I'm really sorry.

1:00:09.773 --> 1:00:11.239
Yeah, so am I.

1:00:13.677 --> 1:00:14.610
[exhales]

1:00:17.014 --> 1:00:19.781
[rooster crows]

1:00:29.627 --> 1:00:31.093
[Dan snores]

1:00:40.204 --> 1:00:41.637
Harry?

1:00:42.306 --> 1:00:46.274
[pigs grunt]

1:00:46.276 --> 1:00:47.309
It wasn't for me, Dad.

1:00:47.311 --> 1:00:48.410
I'm sorry.

1:00:50.781 --> 1:00:52.648
I really don't think
I'm an addict.

1:00:52.650 --> 1:00:54.082
That's what they all say.

1:00:54.084 --> 1:00:56.284
I smoke too much weed.
I have to stop.

1:00:56.286 --> 1:00:58.053
It's no great mystery.

1:00:58.055 --> 1:01:00.288
Yes, but can you stop?

1:01:00.290 --> 1:01:01.423
I think so.

1:01:03.093 --> 1:01:04.760
All my friends smoke.

1:01:06.063 --> 1:01:07.763
I don't know
how I can keep on saying that.

1:01:07.765 --> 1:01:09.665
Well, maybe you need
to make some new friends.

1:01:10.067 --> 1:01:11.833
That's not so easy, is it?

1:01:14.938 --> 1:01:18.373
I just want you
to know I'm sorry.

1:01:19.777 --> 1:01:21.710
What for?

1:01:21.712 --> 1:01:24.780
That it didn't work out
for me and Mom.

1:01:26.216 --> 1:01:29.951
Obviously, I can't help feeling
if we stayed together...

1:01:31.889 --> 1:01:34.990
Then there'd be
no Dylan, no Bobby...

1:01:34.992 --> 1:01:36.224
No Daisy.

1:01:38.362 --> 1:01:39.995
It's okay, Dad.

1:01:41.865 --> 1:01:43.231
I'm gonna be all right.

1:01:43.233 --> 1:01:44.332
I promise.

1:01:45.936 --> 1:01:48.370
But you are going back
after the holidays.

1:01:48.372 --> 1:01:51.073
I really think it's a waste
of time, Dad, and money.

1:01:51.075 --> 1:01:52.741
I mean it.

1:01:52.742 --> 1:01:54.408
You better call your mother,
let her know where you are.

1:01:54.411 --> 1:01:55.711
I'll phone the clinic

1:01:55.713 --> 1:01:56.745
before Nurse Ratchet

1:01:56.747 --> 1:01:58.080
comes looking for you.

1:02:33.250 --> 1:02:37.352
[vacuum cleaner turned on]

1:02:50.167 --> 1:02:52.067
What are you doing?

1:02:52.069 --> 1:02:53.101
Vicky!

1:02:55.105 --> 1:02:57.439
[turns vacuum cleaner off]

1:02:57.441 --> 1:02:58.507
I couldn't sleep.

1:02:58.509 --> 1:03:02.110
Actually, I was thinking
of heading off, yeah,

1:03:02.112 --> 1:03:03.512
avoid the traffic.

1:03:03.514 --> 1:03:05.046
What about the football?

1:03:05.048 --> 1:03:06.782
You're one of our star players.

1:03:07.217 --> 1:03:10.352
-Really?
-I'm counting on you, Vicks.

1:03:10.354 --> 1:03:12.420
England expects.

1:03:13.023 --> 1:03:14.990
Come on, Neverton.
Let's do this.

1:03:16.560 --> 1:03:17.893
Come on, team.

1:03:17.895 --> 1:03:18.894
[Vicky] Here we go, guys.

1:03:18.896 --> 1:03:20.462
[Daisy] You can do this.

1:03:20.464 --> 1:03:21.997
Bee, what are you doing
out there?

1:03:21.999 --> 1:03:24.432
Come on!
The game is about to start.

1:03:25.402 --> 1:03:26.935
[whistle]

1:03:26.937 --> 1:03:31.173
[talking and yelling]

1:03:32.376 --> 1:03:34.509
Go! Go!

1:03:34.511 --> 1:03:36.578
[Daisy] Go Neverton!

1:03:37.548 --> 1:03:40.382
-[Trent] That hurt.
-I hate you. You're disgusting.

1:03:40.384 --> 1:03:42.250
Come on, Tyler, come on.

1:03:42.252 --> 1:03:43.218
Come on, Trent.

1:03:45.022 --> 1:03:45.987
Oh!

1:03:45.989 --> 1:03:47.088
[whistle]

1:03:47.090 --> 1:03:49.391
[applause]

1:03:49.393 --> 1:03:50.258
[Dan] Go on, get in there.

1:03:50.260 --> 1:03:51.543
[dogs grunt]

1:03:51.544 --> 1:03:52.827
-[Bobo whines]
-[Peggy] It's all right.

1:03:52.830 --> 1:03:55.064
[dog barks]

1:03:55.065 --> 1:03:57.299
-[Bobo whines]
-There, there, Mommy's got you.

1:03:57.301 --> 1:03:59.167
Nasty horrid dogs.

1:04:00.237 --> 1:04:01.903
-Go boys!
-Tackle him.

1:04:01.905 --> 1:04:03.238
[whistle]

1:04:03.240 --> 1:04:04.239
Yeah!

1:04:04.241 --> 1:04:06.975
Come on, Harry.

1:04:06.977 --> 1:04:09.578
Stupid game.

1:04:09.580 --> 1:04:12.080
Dan, it's only a game.

1:04:12.082 --> 1:04:13.181
[whistle]

1:04:13.183 --> 1:04:14.616
It's all right, Harry.

1:04:14.618 --> 1:04:16.184
Don't take it to heart.

1:04:16.186 --> 1:04:18.286
It's a dumb fucking game
if you ask me.

1:04:23.360 --> 1:04:24.893
[Dan] What's wrong with you lot?

1:04:24.895 --> 1:04:26.094
We're gonna need more
than sliced oranges.

1:04:26.095 --> 1:04:27.294
This is England
under Royal Hudson.

1:04:27.297 --> 1:04:28.964
Where is the Neverton
fighting spirit?

1:04:28.966 --> 1:04:30.232
[Miranda]
This is not the attitude.

1:04:30.234 --> 1:04:32.467
You're letting these losers
walk all over you.

1:04:32.469 --> 1:04:35.337
What is it? Dan, just--

1:04:35.339 --> 1:04:37.639
Is that supposed
to make us play better?

1:04:39.009 --> 1:04:41.109
[car engine approaches]

1:04:49.319 --> 1:04:50.418
Over here.

1:04:50.420 --> 1:04:51.620
Guys!

1:04:51.622 --> 1:04:53.154
Hey!

1:04:53.156 --> 1:04:55.023
Bee, you are a genius.

1:04:55.025 --> 1:04:55.957
Yes!

1:04:55.959 --> 1:04:59.895
[Miranda] The Polish cavalry
to the rescue.

1:04:59.897 --> 1:05:02.330
[grunts]

1:05:02.332 --> 1:05:05.367
[all scream]

1:05:10.908 --> 1:05:12.040
Hey, hey, hey, cut that out.

1:05:12.042 --> 1:05:13.475
Oh, shut up, Trent.

1:05:13.477 --> 1:05:14.409
[Vicar] Ready?

1:05:17.014 --> 1:05:18.079
[whistle]

1:05:18.081 --> 1:05:19.314
Let's go.

1:05:19.316 --> 1:05:21.116
[Bee] Go, Witek. Go, go.

1:05:21.118 --> 1:05:22.984
Come on, come on. You got this.

1:05:23.387 --> 1:05:24.252
Go, go!

1:05:24.254 --> 1:05:25.120
Yes!

Yes! Come on!

1:05:43.140 --> 1:05:44.272
[all] Yes!

1:05:44.274 --> 1:05:45.640
Harry's.

1:05:45.642 --> 1:05:47.709
[all] Yeah!

1:05:47.711 --> 1:05:50.512
Coming up.

1:05:50.514 --> 1:05:52.681
Yes! Yes!

1:05:53.383 --> 1:05:55.167
Come on, Trent. Come on, Trent.

1:05:55.168 --> 1:05:56.952
Trent... For Christ's sake,
pass the ball.

1:05:56.954 --> 1:05:59.587
[whistle]

1:05:59.589 --> 1:06:01.623
Come on, Rev,
that should have been a red.

1:06:04.161 --> 1:06:06.227
[Daisy] Are you okay,
Uncle Trent?

1:06:06.229 --> 1:06:07.128
[whistle]

1:06:07.130 --> 1:06:08.063
Corner.

1:06:15.472 --> 1:06:20.241
[cheering]

1:06:20.243 --> 1:06:24.012
[whistle]

1:06:24.014 --> 1:06:26.147
Game over, six-five.

1:06:26.149 --> 1:06:27.549
[kids] Yeah!

1:06:27.551 --> 1:06:32.520
[all] Woohoo!

1:06:32.522 --> 1:06:33.655
[dogs bark]

1:06:33.657 --> 1:06:36.424
[woman] Come back.

1:06:36.426 --> 1:06:38.193
Come back you silly boy.

1:06:38.195 --> 1:06:39.561
You were amazing.

1:06:39.563 --> 1:06:41.529
You were absolutely amazing.

1:06:41.531 --> 1:06:42.781
We win?

1:06:42.782 --> 1:06:44.032
Actually, we win thanks to you.

1:06:44.034 --> 1:06:48.603
[dogs barking]

1:07:05.088 --> 1:07:07.655
[Peggy] Where are you,
silly boy?

1:07:10.160 --> 1:07:11.026
I got a piggy bank.

1:07:11.028 --> 1:07:12.611
So cool.

1:07:12.612 --> 1:07:14.195
Mom, look what Tyler got.
It's not even in the shops yet.

1:07:14.197 --> 1:07:16.398
Remember to keep the labels
for your thank-you letters.

1:07:16.400 --> 1:07:17.732
-[Bobby] We will.
-[Dylan] Look what Daisy got.

1:07:17.734 --> 1:07:19.567
Oh, shouldn't we
be waiting for Lyla?

1:07:19.569 --> 1:07:21.703
She said to start without her.

1:07:23.740 --> 1:07:25.573
Oh...

1:07:25.575 --> 1:07:27.042
Thank you, darling.

1:07:27.044 --> 1:07:28.343
Oh, no, wait a minute.

1:07:28.345 --> 1:07:30.045
Oh, Dan,

1:07:30.047 --> 1:07:34.315
how absolutely beautiful,
you dear, dear boy.

1:07:34.317 --> 1:07:36.751
[laughs]

1:07:36.753 --> 1:07:38.219
Um, sorry, hold on, everyone.

1:07:38.221 --> 1:07:39.387
Who's been at the presents?

1:07:39.389 --> 1:07:40.522
It was Daisy.

1:07:40.524 --> 1:07:42.057
She was trying to open them all.

1:07:42.059 --> 1:07:43.558
-No, I wasn't.
-Yes, you were.

1:07:43.560 --> 1:07:45.060
Hey, hey, hey, calmer.

1:07:45.062 --> 1:07:46.594
Excuse me, darling. Sorry.

1:07:46.596 --> 1:07:49.330
Um, sorry, Peggy,
this one's for you.

1:07:49.332 --> 1:07:51.099
Oh, really?

1:07:52.102 --> 1:07:53.601
Happy Christmas, darling.

1:07:53.603 --> 1:07:56.371
Dan, I didn't know you cared.

1:07:56.373 --> 1:07:58.673
[laughing] No, Tren--

1:07:58.675 --> 1:08:01.142
Don't be stupid.

1:08:01.144 --> 1:08:03.344
Vicky, this is for you.

1:08:03.346 --> 1:08:04.412
Thanks.

1:08:04.414 --> 1:08:06.147
I thought it was so you.

1:08:06.149 --> 1:08:07.248
Really?

1:08:07.250 --> 1:08:08.817
So you.

1:08:11.121 --> 1:08:12.253
You can change it if you want.

1:08:12.255 --> 1:08:14.622
No. I love it.

1:08:14.624 --> 1:08:16.074
I thought we agreed

1:08:16.075 --> 1:08:17.525
we weren't going to give
each other proper presents.

1:08:17.527 --> 1:08:18.526
I know, but--

1:08:18.528 --> 1:08:20.228
I love you.

1:08:20.230 --> 1:08:21.796
I love you.

1:08:28.171 --> 1:08:29.604
Here.

1:08:31.141 --> 1:08:34.309
[Gobbles gobbles]

1:08:41.818 --> 1:08:44.819
[toilet flushes]

1:09:15.519 --> 1:09:17.485
You sure you don't have
a girlfriend in Poland?

1:09:17.487 --> 1:09:20.188
No, I promise.

1:09:20.190 --> 1:09:21.756
Or a boyfriend.

1:09:21.758 --> 1:09:22.690
[chuckles]

1:09:22.692 --> 1:09:25.326
-No.
-[laughs]

1:09:40.944 --> 1:09:42.944
Shit.

1:09:42.946 --> 1:09:44.679
Right, that does it.

1:09:47.651 --> 1:09:48.516
No.

1:09:48.518 --> 1:09:50.818
[moans]

1:09:50.820 --> 1:09:53.388
Dad, what the hell
are you doing?

1:09:53.390 --> 1:09:56.824
[Trent] I might very well
ask the same of you.

1:09:56.826 --> 1:09:59.060
[Trent spits]

1:09:59.061 --> 1:10:01.295
Lyla, we put our heart and soul
into this place.

1:10:01.298 --> 1:10:03.464
I really didn't mean
to ruin your Christmas.

1:10:03.466 --> 1:10:06.434
Well, you have.
You could at least have waited.

1:10:06.436 --> 1:10:08.303
Oh, okay, when?

1:10:08.305 --> 1:10:09.837
When will be a good time
to tell you

1:10:09.839 --> 1:10:12.574
that my entire life
is falling apart?

1:10:12.576 --> 1:10:13.775
It's always about you, isn't it?

1:10:13.777 --> 1:10:15.510
It always has been.

1:10:15.512 --> 1:10:17.195
[gasps]

1:10:17.196 --> 1:10:18.879
I don't think
you're being very fair.

1:10:18.882 --> 1:10:20.215
You've got Dan.

1:10:20.217 --> 1:10:21.449
You're happy.

1:10:21.451 --> 1:10:23.785
[sobbing] My life is hell.

1:10:23.787 --> 1:10:25.753
[sobs]

1:10:25.755 --> 1:10:28.723
Well, maybe we get
the life that we deserve.

1:10:32.362 --> 1:10:34.529
I can't believe
she just said that.

1:10:34.531 --> 1:10:35.830
I can.

1:10:40.770 --> 1:10:42.437
What is your problem?

1:10:42.439 --> 1:10:44.372
You've got a fucking nerve
after last night.

1:10:44.374 --> 1:10:45.940
You watch your fucking mouth.

1:10:45.942 --> 1:10:47.275
Mom.

1:10:47.277 --> 1:10:48.376
Where are you, Mom?

1:10:48.378 --> 1:10:49.244
You wouldn't dare.

1:10:49.246 --> 1:10:50.011
Mom!

1:10:50.013 --> 1:10:51.446
Bee, please.

1:10:51.448 --> 1:10:53.514
She'll fire me.
Is that what you want?

1:10:53.516 --> 1:10:54.449
Fire you?

1:10:54.985 --> 1:10:57.018
Divorce me. Fire me. Both.

1:10:57.621 --> 1:10:59.854
Good. It's what you deserve.

1:11:03.760 --> 1:11:04.626
[Trent] Bee.

1:11:04.628 --> 1:11:06.327
Bee.

1:11:06.329 --> 1:11:07.262
Bee.

1:11:08.865 --> 1:11:09.931
Hey!

1:11:12.936 --> 1:11:15.770
Bee, Bee, you have
every reason to be angry.

1:11:15.772 --> 1:11:16.771
We were drunk.

1:11:16.773 --> 1:11:18.006
It didn't mean anything.

1:11:18.008 --> 1:11:19.874
We were stupid.

1:11:19.876 --> 1:11:24.479
I know it doesn't help,
but I am truly, truly sorry.

1:11:25.548 --> 1:11:26.514
Slut.

1:11:35.725 --> 1:11:36.958
Open the door, Mom.

1:11:36.960 --> 1:11:39.294
Go away, please.

1:11:39.296 --> 1:11:40.828
Please, I need to speak to you.

1:11:40.830 --> 1:11:43.665
I have a terrible migraine.

1:11:43.667 --> 1:11:44.832
It's a really bad migraine.

1:11:44.834 --> 1:11:46.434
You wanna make it worse?

1:11:46.435 --> 1:11:48.035
-Mom.
-Think about the consequences.

1:11:48.672 --> 1:11:52.907
Guys, please,
I just want some me time.

1:11:52.909 --> 1:11:53.875
[Bee] Mom.

1:11:53.877 --> 1:11:56.044
Think about Tyler.

1:11:56.046 --> 1:11:58.346
Tyler's a brat.

1:11:58.348 --> 1:12:00.381
[Bee knocks on the door]

1:12:00.850 --> 1:12:02.634
Maybe she's right.

1:12:02.635 --> 1:12:04.419
Maybe this whole thing
is a ridiculous idea.

1:12:04.421 --> 1:12:06.387
You don't even like the country.

1:12:06.389 --> 1:12:08.723
Oh, so it's my fault.
I should have known.

1:12:08.725 --> 1:12:10.958
Don't be stupid.
That's not what I'm saying.

1:12:10.960 --> 1:12:12.794
The stupid thing
was getting into this

1:12:12.796 --> 1:12:14.629
without proper legal advice.

1:12:14.631 --> 1:12:16.597
You completely misrepresented
the situation.

1:12:16.599 --> 1:12:17.999
How?

1:12:18.001 --> 1:12:20.435
How did I misrepresent
the situation?

1:12:20.437 --> 1:12:21.569
You said the house was yours.

1:12:21.571 --> 1:12:22.704
I thought it was.

1:12:22.706 --> 1:12:23.971
That's what it said in the will.

1:12:23.973 --> 1:12:25.790
But, apparently, it isn't.

1:12:25.791 --> 1:12:27.608
That's what's called
misrepresenting the situation.

1:12:29.479 --> 1:12:31.412
I suppose we could always
move in with Miriam.

1:12:32.615 --> 1:12:33.648
Very funny.

1:12:35.919 --> 1:12:39.354
Okay, but there'll have
to be some changes.

1:12:39.356 --> 1:12:40.688
-[Trent] You got it.
-I need a new car.

1:12:40.690 --> 1:12:42.790
-Right.
-I hate my school.

1:12:42.792 --> 1:12:44.759
Okay, okay.

1:12:45.795 --> 1:12:47.862
And I wanna stay here
for a while

1:12:47.864 --> 1:12:49.097
with Aunty Miranda

1:12:49.099 --> 1:12:51.632
after you've gone.

1:13:10.153 --> 1:13:12.820
[grunts]

1:13:12.822 --> 1:13:13.755
[car door closes]

1:13:14.657 --> 1:13:15.990
[car engine starts]

1:13:15.992 --> 1:13:16.924
Vicky?

1:13:21.798 --> 1:13:24.465
Vicky!

1:13:24.467 --> 1:13:26.033
Where are you going?

1:13:27.437 --> 1:13:29.137
Vicky.

1:13:29.139 --> 1:13:30.605
Vicky.

1:13:30.607 --> 1:13:32.974
Vicky, stop. Stop.

1:13:32.976 --> 1:13:34.041
Vicky, stop.

1:13:34.043 --> 1:13:35.076
Where are you going?

1:13:35.078 --> 1:13:36.677
Sorry, I can't talk--

1:13:36.679 --> 1:13:38.179
Please, please,
I'll explain later.

1:13:38.181 --> 1:13:40.415
What the hell happened?
What's going on?

1:13:42.519 --> 1:13:44.051
[Miranda] I mean...

1:13:44.053 --> 1:13:46.454
Vicky, how could you.

1:13:46.456 --> 1:13:47.922
[Vicky] I was drunk.

1:13:47.924 --> 1:13:50.158
I'm not proud of myself.

1:13:50.860 --> 1:13:52.927
I haven't told you
the worst part.

1:13:54.664 --> 1:13:55.897
Bee saw us.

1:13:56.499 --> 1:13:57.498
What?

1:13:57.500 --> 1:13:59.867
She caught us...

1:13:59.869 --> 1:14:01.602
in the loo.

1:14:01.604 --> 1:14:02.737
-You mean--
-Yes.

1:14:02.739 --> 1:14:04.472
Do I have to draw a diagram?

1:14:04.874 --> 1:14:05.740
Actually--

1:14:05.742 --> 1:14:08.509
Well, not quite actually,

1:14:08.511 --> 1:14:11.646
but almost actually.

1:14:11.648 --> 1:14:15.950
Oh, gods please, please,
don't tell Dan.

1:14:15.952 --> 1:14:17.985
I feel so--

1:14:17.987 --> 1:14:20.621
I feel so ashamed.

1:14:20.623 --> 1:14:23.958
Why does-- Why does this
always happen to me?

1:14:23.960 --> 1:14:28.196
Because you're beautiful
and sexy and...

1:14:28.198 --> 1:14:30.565
absolutely desirable.

1:14:30.567 --> 1:14:32.099
I'm a joke.

1:14:33.036 --> 1:14:35.102
Please don't go.

1:14:35.104 --> 1:14:37.839
You leave now, then everyone's
going to know what happened,

1:14:37.841 --> 1:14:39.574
including Lyla.

1:14:45.748 --> 1:14:47.081
[sighs]

1:14:51.120 --> 1:14:52.487
Hello?

1:14:53.923 --> 1:14:55.373
[Bobo barks]

1:14:55.374 --> 1:14:56.824
Miriam, what are you doing here?

1:14:56.826 --> 1:14:58.593
I never thought I'd see the day.

1:14:58.595 --> 1:15:00.228
I've come to get Harry.

1:15:01.264 --> 1:15:04.232
[Bobo barks in the distance]

1:15:07.670 --> 1:15:08.836
[knocking on the door]

1:15:08.838 --> 1:15:11.205
[Miriam] Harry. Harry.

1:15:11.207 --> 1:15:13.007
Come on.
Come on, open up, Harry.

1:15:13.009 --> 1:15:13.875
Why is it locked?

1:15:13.877 --> 1:15:14.742
[knocking on the door]

1:15:14.744 --> 1:15:16.628
Harry!

1:15:16.629 --> 1:15:18.513
-[Harry blows]
-[Miriam] Open the door.

1:15:19.516 --> 1:15:20.815
Mom, what are you doing here?

1:15:20.817 --> 1:15:22.283
How could you? You promised.

1:15:22.285 --> 1:15:24.218
-About what?
-You-- To leave the clinic.

1:15:24.220 --> 1:15:27.755
You promised, you promised
that you would give it a go.

1:15:27.757 --> 1:15:28.623
[sniffs]

1:15:28.625 --> 1:15:31.125
-Oh, for Christ's sake.

1:15:31.127 --> 1:15:32.627
-Mom--
-Harry.

1:15:32.629 --> 1:15:34.229
Honestly, it's no big deal,

1:15:34.230 --> 1:15:35.830
it's just an old roach
from the last time I was here.

1:15:35.832 --> 1:15:37.031
How could you be so stupid?

1:15:37.032 --> 1:15:38.231
No, no, no, that's it.
There's no more.

1:15:38.234 --> 1:15:40.234
But that isn't--
That is not the point.

1:15:40.236 --> 1:15:42.236
You-- you can't do this anymore.

1:15:42.238 --> 1:15:45.806
Harry, you-- you--
You just can't do this anymore.

1:15:47.210 --> 1:15:49.544
Dan, Miriam's here.

1:15:49.546 --> 1:15:50.912
What? Where?

1:15:50.914 --> 1:15:53.648

1:17:55.972 --> 1:17:58.005
[Gobbles gobbles]

1:17:58.007 --> 1:17:59.273

Um, well,

1:18:07.350 --> 1:18:10.718
Oh, that will-- that will
have to do, I suppose.

1:18:10.720 --> 1:18:13.320
Can we get rid of the chicken
from the food preparation area?

1:18:13.322 --> 1:18:15.690
It's basically a Petri dish
with feathers.

1:18:15.692 --> 1:18:16.808
Come on.

1:18:16.809 --> 1:18:17.925
It's not just salmonella
you can get.

No, it's--

1:18:19.696 --> 1:18:22.697
It's salmonella,
campylobacter, listeria,

Worse, actually.
I'm not actually joking.

1:18:29.205 --> 1:18:30.755
You should probably have

1:18:30.756 --> 1:18:32.306
special chicken clothes
if you want to cuddle it.

1:18:34.277 --> 1:18:36.243

[Miranda] Hey, what is it?

1:19:09.078 --> 1:19:10.311
You don't wanna know.

1:19:10.313 --> 1:19:11.779
It's probably illegal.

1:19:11.781 --> 1:19:12.947
And if it isn't, it ought to be.

1:19:14.083 --> 1:19:14.982

I'm sure he'll show up.

No, you never are.

Come on, guys,
let's go have a drink.

1:19:25.862 --> 1:19:27.394
How could you let him
discharge himself

1:19:27.396 --> 1:19:29.230
just when we finally
got him into a clinic?

1:19:29.866 --> 1:19:31.532
Miriam, he's over 18.

1:19:31.534 --> 1:19:33.434
He can do what he likes.

1:19:33.436 --> 1:19:35.269
You think I had
anything to do with it?

1:19:35.271 --> 1:19:37.171
Always going
for the easy option.

1:19:37.173 --> 1:19:40.074

than ever is a strong father.

[Bobo barks]

1:19:41.110 --> 1:19:44.812
You know, maybe if we just made
a bit less of a fuss over Harry,

1:19:44.814 --> 1:19:46.781
he might be a lot better for it.

1:19:46.783 --> 1:19:49.083
I'm sorry, what is that
supposed to mean?

1:19:49.085 --> 1:19:52.086
It means that maybe he's a lot
less fragile than we think.

1:19:52.088 --> 1:19:53.921
If we keep treating him
like a basket case,

1:19:53.923 --> 1:19:55.523
then that's what he'll be,
a basket case.

1:19:55.525 --> 1:19:58.893
Excuse me, I live with him.

what you're talking about.

is helping.

[Harry laughs]

1:26:31.220 --> 1:26:32.519
[Harry laughs]

1:26:35.958 --> 1:26:39.226
[Soon and Harry laugh]

1:26:48.270 --> 1:26:52.973
[upbeat music playing]

1:26:52.975 --> 1:26:59.246
[indistinct chatter]

1:27:03.552 --> 1:27:05.752
Slow down. Sorry, everybody.
I just have a--

1:27:05.754 --> 1:27:07.287
I just have
a brief announcement.

1:27:07.289 --> 1:27:09.756
[music stops]

1:27:09.758 --> 1:27:13.660
Lyla's series got picked up
for a whole another season.

1:27:16.498 --> 1:27:20.000
-[Miranda] Fantastic!
-Congratulations!

1:27:20.002 --> 1:27:22.302
-I'm so proud.
-[Dan] That's amazing.

1:27:22.304 --> 1:27:26.607
[applause]

1:27:26.609 --> 1:27:28.375
[Trent] Isn't that great,
everyone?

1:27:29.778 --> 1:27:31.678
Brilliant.

1:27:34.883 --> 1:27:36.383
Oh, I can't believe it.

1:27:36.385 --> 1:27:37.951
-Bravo! Bravo!
-Oh, thank you.

1:27:37.953 --> 1:27:40.254
[upbeat music starts playing]

1:27:44.593 --> 1:27:47.661
[giggles]

1:27:47.663 --> 1:27:49.863
[laughs]

1:27:49.865 --> 1:27:51.932
[Miranda] We are gonna
celebrate this.

1:27:51.934 --> 1:27:52.833
You all right, Trent?

1:27:52.835 --> 1:27:53.967
[clears his throat]

1:27:53.969 --> 1:27:55.369
[Bobo barks]

1:27:55.371 --> 1:27:57.271
Get off me.

1:27:57.273 --> 1:27:59.640
What on Earth
is matter with you?

1:27:59.642 --> 1:28:00.674
You silly dog.

1:28:05.581 --> 1:28:10.284
-[all laugh]
-[Bobo barks]

1:28:10.286 --> 1:28:13.487
You're a dirty,
disgusting little dog.

1:28:15.491 --> 1:28:17.291
Ugh.

1:28:17.293 --> 1:28:20.560
[Miriam] Come along,
it's about to midnight. Bed.

1:28:20.562 --> 1:28:22.496
-Goodnight, darlings.
-Bed.

1:28:22.498 --> 1:28:24.598
-Good night, Mom.
-See you in the morning.

1:28:24.600 --> 1:28:27.301
Good night, Dad.

1:28:27.303 --> 1:28:28.368
[Daisy] Good night, Dad.

1:28:28.370 --> 1:28:29.369
Yes.

1:28:29.371 --> 1:28:30.337
Whoo!

1:28:30.339 --> 1:28:32.873
[laughs]

1:28:32.875 --> 1:28:34.574
-Whoo!
-[laughs]

1:28:34.576 --> 1:28:35.976
-Come on, Trent.
-[Trent] No, I can't.

1:28:35.978 --> 1:28:37.978
-Get up.
-[Trent] I can't, I'm injured.

1:28:37.980 --> 1:28:40.414
I'm so happy.

1:29:03.639 --> 1:29:05.706
[knocking on the door]

1:29:07.509 --> 1:29:09.042
[doorbell rings]

1:29:11.480 --> 1:29:12.512
Oh.

1:29:30.499 --> 1:29:32.933
[Trent] ¶ <i> Oh </i> ¶

1:29:32.935 --> 1:29:34.468
[gasps]

1:29:36.405 --> 1:29:37.838
[Lyla] Oh, dear.

1:29:37.840 --> 1:29:40.073
-[Trent] Shit.
-[Lyla] Soon's parents.

1:29:40.075 --> 1:29:41.475
[Dan] Trent,
what's he doing here?

1:29:41.477 --> 1:29:42.442
[Lyla] Trent.

1:29:44.880 --> 1:29:46.580
[Harry] Wait, wait, wait. Hey.

1:29:52.621 --> 1:29:53.653
Mr. Wang.

1:29:53.655 --> 1:29:55.088
[music stops]

1:29:55.090 --> 1:29:57.891
Bernie, I think
you're overreacting here.

1:29:57.893 --> 1:30:00.994
You, very disrespectful.

1:30:01.597 --> 1:30:02.562
[Lyla] Oh, God.

1:30:02.564 --> 1:30:05.866
Bernie, can we talk
about this tomorrow?

1:30:05.868 --> 1:30:08.502
Please. It's honestly
not such a big deal.

1:30:10.439 --> 1:30:12.472
Oh, fuck it.

1:30:15.411 --> 1:30:17.644
I write you e-email.
You write me back, yes?

1:30:17.646 --> 1:30:20.013
I'm gonna learn Chinese.
Don't forget me.

1:30:30.092 --> 1:30:31.525
[sighs]

1:30:31.527 --> 1:30:33.493
Good job, Harry.

1:30:33.495 --> 1:30:35.028
I think you made
a bit of a hit there.

1:30:35.030 --> 1:30:36.596
Do you really think so?

1:30:36.598 --> 1:30:38.498
Without a doubt.

1:30:38.500 --> 1:30:40.434
She's a very special girl.

1:30:40.436 --> 1:30:41.601
You're a lucky guy.

1:30:42.838 --> 1:30:45.105
I'm sorry I messed up
your movie deal.

1:30:45.107 --> 1:30:47.040
Ah, forget it.

1:30:47.910 --> 1:30:50.610
Never thought it'd come through.

1:30:50.612 --> 1:30:52.979
It's kind of a relief
if you really wanna know.

1:30:55.117 --> 1:30:57.951
I've been thinking
about your situation.

1:30:57.953 --> 1:30:59.886
Both our situations, in fact.

1:31:01.156 --> 1:31:02.889
I got a proposal for you.

1:31:02.891 --> 1:31:04.658
Really?

1:31:04.660 --> 1:31:06.526
Will you hear me out?

1:31:06.528 --> 1:31:10.897
Then you can say yes
or you can say no.

1:31:17.639 --> 1:31:20.674
The family that you choose can
sometimes be more important

1:31:20.676 --> 1:31:22.108
than the family
that you're given.

1:31:23.879 --> 1:31:27.180
I feel a real closeness
to all of you guys.

1:31:28.183 --> 1:31:29.816
Thank you, Trent.

1:31:29.818 --> 1:31:31.818
I'm sure
the feeling's reciprocated.

1:31:31.820 --> 1:31:34.521
-I mean, it is reciprocated.
-Of course, it is.

1:31:34.523 --> 1:31:36.089
Particularly this young man.

1:31:36.091 --> 1:31:38.625
I think I can identify
with some of the issues

1:31:38.627 --> 1:31:40.927
he's dealing with, God knows.

1:31:40.929 --> 1:31:42.729
We had a long talk last night,
didn't we, Harry?

1:31:42.731 --> 1:31:44.764
Yeah, we did.

1:31:44.766 --> 1:31:47.133
In short, Miriam, Dan...

1:31:48.537 --> 1:31:49.903
I want you to lend me your son.

1:31:50.606 --> 1:31:51.938
I think I can help him,

1:31:51.940 --> 1:31:54.908
and he can
almost certainly help me.

1:31:54.910 --> 1:31:58.111
Uh, Trent's asked me
to go with him to America.

1:31:59.114 --> 1:32:01.281
There's this great clinic
in Arizona,

1:32:01.283 --> 1:32:02.616
and we're gonna do it together.

1:32:05.254 --> 1:32:06.586
What-- do--

1:32:06.588 --> 1:32:07.721
I mean, do you have any idea

1:32:07.723 --> 1:32:08.889
how much those places cost?

1:32:08.891 --> 1:32:10.223
Oh, Dan, please, it's on us.

1:32:10.225 --> 1:32:12.025
I talked about it
with Lyla last night.

1:32:12.728 --> 1:32:14.761
You'd actually
be doing me a favor

1:32:14.763 --> 1:32:16.263
by letting Harry come with me.

1:32:17.232 --> 1:32:19.533
Well, that's incredibly
generous, Trent, but we--

1:32:19.535 --> 1:32:21.234
We couldn't possibly
let you pay.

1:32:21.236 --> 1:32:23.537
Okay, can I--
Can I just say something?

1:32:24.573 --> 1:32:26.740
Strictly <i> entre nous?</i>

1:32:28.010 --> 1:32:29.543
The series is a piece of crap.

1:32:29.545 --> 1:32:33.280
I mean, really excremental,

1:32:33.282 --> 1:32:35.649
but it pays a shitload of money.

1:32:36.852 --> 1:32:38.618
Let's put some of those
ill-gotten gains

1:32:38.620 --> 1:32:41.621
to good use, shall we?

1:32:45.861 --> 1:32:48.128
[sighs]

1:32:48.130 --> 1:32:51.565
Thank you for everything.

1:32:51.567 --> 1:32:52.265
[laughs]

1:32:52.267 --> 1:32:54.167
It's been great.

1:32:54.169 --> 1:32:56.303
And don't worry about the house.

1:32:56.305 --> 1:32:57.938
I'm sure we can
work something out

1:32:57.940 --> 1:32:59.105
now that the pressure is off.

1:32:59.107 --> 1:33:00.173
Thank you.

1:33:00.175 --> 1:33:01.608
And please,

1:33:01.610 --> 1:33:02.842
don't you worry about Bee.

1:33:02.844 --> 1:33:04.177
Oh.

1:33:04.179 --> 1:33:06.046
You get Bee. We get Harry.

1:33:06.048 --> 1:33:08.848
Well, maybe we can do a better
job with each other's kids.

1:33:08.850 --> 1:33:10.984
Oh, mm.

1:33:10.986 --> 1:33:14.020
-I love you.
-Love you.

1:33:14.022 --> 1:33:17.958
And when the internet's
back up, follow me on Instagram.

1:33:17.960 --> 1:33:19.259
Bye.

1:33:21.830 --> 1:33:24.064
Look, I can never
thank you enough.

1:33:25.267 --> 1:33:27.667
[laughs]

1:33:27.669 --> 1:33:29.970
And I'm sorry it didn't
work out with Mr. Wang.

1:33:29.972 --> 1:33:31.638
You know,
there's the important stuff

1:33:31.640 --> 1:33:33.974
and then there's
the important stuff.

1:33:33.976 --> 1:33:35.075
-[chuckles]
-Right?

1:33:35.077 --> 1:33:36.343
Right.

1:33:40.282 --> 1:33:42.082
Oh, and, Trent,

1:33:42.084 --> 1:33:44.751
we survived, we live
to fight another Christmas.

1:33:44.753 --> 1:33:47.354
Next year,
same time, same place.

1:33:47.356 --> 1:33:49.689
You're more than welcome
to come to us in the meantime.

1:33:49.691 --> 1:33:51.658
Oh, and I'll send you
some goat's milk.

1:33:51.660 --> 1:33:53.159
Oh, please don't.

1:33:53.161 --> 1:33:55.128
[both laugh]

1:33:55.130 --> 1:33:56.296
See ya.

1:33:56.298 --> 1:33:57.397
-[Miranda] Bye.
-Bye.

1:33:57.399 --> 1:33:59.132
-Bye.
-Bye.

1:34:00.836 --> 1:34:02.335
[twins] Bye, Tyler.

1:34:02.337 --> 1:34:04.004
Bye, Aunty Lyla.

1:34:04.006 --> 1:34:05.639
Bye.

1:34:05.641 --> 1:34:06.339
Bye, Tyler.

1:34:06.341 --> 1:34:07.707
Bye, Trent.

1:34:07.709 --> 1:34:08.775
Bye, Aunty Lyla.

1:34:08.777 --> 1:34:09.876
[whispering] Thank God.

1:34:09.878 --> 1:34:10.977
[twins] See you next year.

1:34:10.979 --> 1:34:12.212
Bye.

1:34:17.319 --> 1:34:18.852
-[Miranda] Goodbye.
-Thank you.

1:34:18.854 --> 1:34:20.053
Thank you for coming.

1:34:20.055 --> 1:34:23.056
-Lovely time.
-Thank you.

1:34:23.058 --> 1:34:24.991
-Thank you, dear boy.
-My pleasure.

1:34:24.993 --> 1:34:26.393
Oh.

1:34:27.929 --> 1:34:29.696
-Take care.
-And you.

1:34:30.232 --> 1:34:31.364
[Miriam] Harry!

1:34:37.439 --> 1:34:39.005
Oh, and...

1:34:39.007 --> 1:34:40.407
Thanks for giving
the old girl a lift.

1:34:40.409 --> 1:34:41.741
Oh, okay.

1:34:41.743 --> 1:34:43.843
And thanks for a black eye.

1:34:43.845 --> 1:34:45.845
-Oh, pleasure.
-[laughs]

1:34:45.847 --> 1:34:47.047
No, really, for everything.

1:34:48.784 --> 1:34:51.851
I know it hasn't been easy
dealing with it all on your own.

1:34:51.853 --> 1:34:52.752
No, it hasn't.

1:34:52.754 --> 1:34:53.920
And I'm sorry

1:34:53.922 --> 1:34:55.288
that I have apparently made

1:34:55.290 --> 1:34:56.389
such a hash of it.

1:34:57.325 --> 1:34:59.392
You haven't, actually.

1:35:00.462 --> 1:35:01.928
We're gonna deal with it
together.

1:35:01.930 --> 1:35:02.796
[sobs]

1:35:02.798 --> 1:35:04.297
-Okay?
-Okay.

1:35:04.299 --> 1:35:06.466
-[laughs]
-[laughs]

1:35:08.103 --> 1:35:10.070
Take care. Drive safe.

1:35:14.276 --> 1:35:15.275
[both sigh]

1:35:15.277 --> 1:35:16.409
[car engine starts]

1:35:16.411 --> 1:35:18.945
-Sure this is what you want?
-Yeah, I'm sure.

1:35:18.947 --> 1:35:20.780
I'm gonna make it work
this time.

1:35:21.850 --> 1:35:23.850
-I know you will.
-Yeah.

1:35:26.088 --> 1:35:29.055
I'm proud of you, Harry. I am.

1:35:31.460 --> 1:35:32.792
Take care of yourself, okay?

1:35:32.794 --> 1:35:35.295
[Harry] Yeah. See you soon.

1:35:42.504 --> 1:35:44.871
-[Dan] Bye.
-[Miranda] Bye, Miriam.

1:35:44.873 --> 1:35:46.139
-[car horn honks]
-[Daisy] Bye, Harry.

1:35:46.141 --> 1:35:47.874
Bye. Take care.

1:35:47.876 --> 1:35:49.943
Bye.

1:35:49.945 --> 1:35:51.177
[car horn honks]

1:35:51.179 --> 1:35:52.812
Goodbye, everyone. Love you.

1:35:52.814 --> 1:35:53.947
Bye-bye.

1:35:54.750 --> 1:35:56.149

[Gobbles gobbles]

1:36:01.223 --> 1:36:02.789
Dan?

1:36:02.791 --> 1:36:04.224
What is it?

1:36:04.226 --> 1:36:05.759
[Gobbles gobbles]

1:36:05.761 --> 1:36:07.427
I could've sworn
I just saw Gobbles.

1:36:10.866 --> 1:36:12.098
Impossible.

1:36:22.878 --> 1:36:24.210
[sighs]

1:36:24.212 --> 1:36:26.246
Never ever again.

1:36:26.248 --> 1:36:27.514
You say that every year.

1:36:27.516 --> 1:36:29.215
No, I mean it this time.

1:36:30.152 --> 1:36:31.551
Come here.

1:36:32.387 --> 1:36:33.820
Come here.

1:36:38.827 --> 1:36:41.027
Oh, that's nice.

1:36:42.564 --> 1:36:45.899
I just wanna say thank you.

1:36:45.901 --> 1:36:47.066
What for?

1:36:47.068 --> 1:36:48.468
For working so hard,

1:36:48.470 --> 1:36:51.805
for making it work,

1:36:51.807 --> 1:36:53.106
Christmas.

1:36:53.108 --> 1:36:54.908
I thought you hated Christmas.

1:36:54.910 --> 1:36:58.211
Yeah, this was one
of the better ones in the end.

1:36:58.213 --> 1:37:00.814
[Miranda laughs]

1:37:00.816 --> 1:37:02.182
It was actually
one of the greater.

1:37:02.184 --> 1:37:04.317
-Yeah.
-Credit where credit's due.

1:37:04.319 --> 1:37:06.519
