WEBVTT

00:34.493 --> 00:36.412
Oh, it tastes like fish eggs.

00:38.039 --> 00:40.083
I think they are, Einstein.

00:40.166 --> 00:42.335
And it tops out at $200 an ounce.

00:42.418 --> 00:44.629
You two really think
you can crash this party?

00:44.713 --> 00:47.381
-Yes.
-We're kind of ambitious.

00:47.465 --> 00:49.843
-Are you gonna kick us out, bro?
-Depends.

00:49.926 --> 00:52.095
Are you pompous jackasses?

00:52.178 --> 00:54.180
Uh, well, we're not... pompous.

00:54.263 --> 00:55.932
--Help yourself.

00:57.141 --> 00:59.352
Mmm, the taste kind of grows on you.

01:00.519 --> 01:02.606
You wanna get down on this?
Pull up a stool.

01:02.689 --> 01:04.608
Uh, you do that.
I'm gonna find the alcohol.

01:04.691 --> 01:07.276
Genius! And grab me a beer!

01:09.028 --> 01:12.115
It's not a cabin cruiser,
it's a yacht.

01:12.198 --> 01:14.200
For the $24,000
we're paying Dalton,

01:14.283 --> 01:16.745
I would expect Jackson's
modern dance to be included.

01:16.828 --> 01:18.830
I like the way
the Jets are playing this year.

01:59.120 --> 02:01.164
-Excuse me.
-It's time to go.

02:01.247 --> 02:03.249
- No, I'm just looking for--
- You found it.

02:03.332 --> 02:04.876
Come on.

02:13.760 --> 02:15.094
He's with me.

02:16.429 --> 02:17.806
Excuse me.

03:35.633 --> 03:38.594
Mmm! German beer.
Tastes like piss.

03:41.014 --> 03:42.724
What the hell are you doing here?

03:42.807 --> 03:44.851
You've never been hard to find.

03:45.643 --> 03:46.978
That's not what I asked.

03:47.812 --> 03:49.856
At least your furniture's improved.

03:51.607 --> 03:53.151
Kinda liked my old futon.

03:53.234 --> 03:55.820
I liked breaking it in.

03:55.904 --> 03:57.822
Nice place.

03:57.906 --> 04:00.283
Too bad about the clothes, though.

04:00.366 --> 04:01.575
Why are you here?

04:04.537 --> 04:06.790
Would you believe it if I said
I missed you?

04:06.873 --> 04:08.582
-No.
-Smart man.

04:08.666 --> 04:11.085
Columbia education really paid off.

04:11.169 --> 04:14.005
- No thanks to you.

04:14.088 --> 04:17.091
I'm in New York for a meeting.
I thought I'd pop by.

04:17.175 --> 04:19.552
Well, you're not staying here, so...

04:19.635 --> 04:20.970
Fine.

04:21.054 --> 04:24.390
My penthouse in midtown
will just have to do, then.

04:24.473 --> 04:25.683
We spent some nights there.

04:25.767 --> 04:27.476
Look, if you came here
to walk down memory lane,

04:27.560 --> 04:28.812
-I don't really have the--
-I'm sorry.

04:30.646 --> 04:35.484
I've spent years trying to convince myself
that things happen for a reason,

04:35.568 --> 04:38.279
that you and I were not meant to be.

04:41.574 --> 04:44.618
But I know now.
That wasn't fate.

04:45.494 --> 04:46.788
It was a choice.

04:48.414 --> 04:49.707
My choice.

04:51.584 --> 04:52.919
And I'm sorry.

04:56.923 --> 04:59.050
I'm alone in the world, Matthew.

05:00.468 --> 05:02.345
Do you know what that feels like?

05:06.224 --> 05:07.516
Of course you do.

05:09.102 --> 05:12.814
And you know what it's like
to clean up your father's messes.

05:15.358 --> 05:17.151
A long time ago,
before he died,

05:17.235 --> 05:20.196
my father did business
with the Roxxon Corporation.

05:20.279 --> 05:21.280
Roxxon?

05:21.364 --> 05:24.242
Energy, cleaning supplies,
macaroni and cheese.

05:24.325 --> 05:26.744
Child labor, slave trade.

05:26.828 --> 05:28.371
They have their fingers in everything.

05:28.454 --> 05:30.789
I believe it's called diversification.

05:30.874 --> 05:33.251
And thanks to my father's
shitty investments,

05:33.334 --> 05:34.627
they hold most of his wealth.

05:34.710 --> 05:35.753
Yeah, okay, I...

05:37.046 --> 05:40.674
I have a meeting tomorrow with the board
at the Yakatomi Building.

05:41.759 --> 05:43.636
And I need your help, Matthew.

05:43.719 --> 05:45.763
How am I supposed to help you?

05:45.846 --> 05:48.516
I want you to use that expensive
legal training of yours

05:48.599 --> 05:51.060
-to help me get my money back.
-See, I'm a defense lawyer.

05:51.144 --> 05:53.938
- I'll pay you well.
- I'm not taking your money.

05:54.022 --> 05:56.815
And, even if I accepted,
there's not enough time.

05:56.900 --> 05:59.110
-For what?
-Oh, just research.

05:59.193 --> 06:01.404
Accounts, shareholders,
hierarchy of the--

06:01.487 --> 06:04.532
-You have 15 hours.
-Fifteen hours, Elektra, are you insane?

06:04.615 --> 06:05.866
Matthew.

06:09.745 --> 06:11.664
You're the only person I can trust.

06:11.747 --> 06:15.876
Well, sweetheart, you don't break into
my house and then talk to me about trust.

06:15.960 --> 06:17.795
Don't overthink it.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.214
It's just a bunch of guys
in business suits.

06:20.298 --> 06:22.341
They won't know what hit them.

06:22.425 --> 06:24.760
Would be fun, like old times.

06:24.843 --> 06:27.972
Oh, you and I,
we have very different ideas of fun.

06:28.056 --> 06:29.432
You can say whatever you want.

06:29.515 --> 06:32.018
-But I know you--
-No, you don't.

06:32.101 --> 06:33.227
You don't, not anymore.

06:34.478 --> 06:36.940
Not... ever again.

06:41.986 --> 06:43.904
Well...

06:43.988 --> 06:45.781
that's disappointing.

06:48.451 --> 06:49.535
Get out.

07:06.885 --> 07:08.471
Morning.

07:08.554 --> 07:11.432
We, uh, have anything for breakfast?

07:11.515 --> 07:12.850
You hungry or hungover?

07:15.103 --> 07:16.770
- Both.

07:16.854 --> 07:20.858
All right, you need some potassium,
some electrolytes, and a jolt of caffeine.

07:20.942 --> 07:23.027
I'll give you, uh...

07:24.403 --> 07:28.241
The last piece of Mrs. DiNizio's
peach cobbler,

07:28.324 --> 07:31.077
which is the last piece of anything
in this office.

07:31.160 --> 07:33.912
I guess our finances
haven't improved since last week.

07:33.997 --> 07:37.333
Yeah, well, clients don't respond well
to a "closed" sign.

07:39.585 --> 07:40.586
Yeah, it's my fault.

07:40.669 --> 07:42.671
-I'm sorry, Foggy.
-Don't be.

07:42.755 --> 07:44.090
Punisher off the street.

07:44.173 --> 07:46.342
I'm hoping Reyes
will get her jackboot off our neck

07:46.425 --> 07:48.594
and this office can go back to normal.

07:48.677 --> 07:51.222
Oh, yeah? Normal? What's that?

07:52.974 --> 07:55.768
Matt. Uh, good morning.

07:55.851 --> 07:57.020
Hey, Karen.

07:58.062 --> 07:59.397
Did you sleep well?

08:00.189 --> 08:02.025
Uh, not so much. You?

08:02.733 --> 08:03.901
Me? Yeah, sure.

08:03.985 --> 08:05.194
I mean...

08:06.195 --> 08:07.530
Is that coffee I can smell?

08:08.239 --> 08:09.490
- Hmm?
- Coffee.

08:09.573 --> 08:10.992
Uh, yeah, um...

08:11.075 --> 08:13.119
Yeah, arabica for all.

08:13.202 --> 08:16.080
- For everyone.
- Wow, thank you. You're a goddess.

08:16.164 --> 08:18.707
Okay, you two.
Let's talk business.

08:18.791 --> 08:20.834
Potential clients. Real ones.
With bank in the bank.

08:20.918 --> 08:24.047
Uh, actually, yeah, can we, uh...
talk about these first?

08:24.922 --> 08:27.716
The, uh, press is still painting Castle

08:27.800 --> 08:30.761
like he's nothing more than
some deranged lunatic.

08:30.844 --> 08:33.722
Well, it's not like our boy was
out collecting for the Red Cross.

08:33.806 --> 08:36.934
-I know. I know, but--
-You think there's more to the story.

08:37.018 --> 08:39.270
Exactly. I mean, five different papers

08:39.353 --> 08:41.189
and not a word about the bullet
he took to the brain,

08:41.272 --> 08:42.940
or his military record, or his family.

08:43.649 --> 08:44.983
Uh, his family?

08:46.985 --> 08:48.237
Um...

08:48.321 --> 08:49.405
Okay, uh...

08:50.656 --> 08:51.949
I found this photograph.

08:52.033 --> 08:54.410
It's of him and his wife and kids
at the carousel.

08:54.493 --> 08:55.828
You found it where?

08:57.080 --> 08:58.664
I sort of broke into his house.

08:58.747 --> 08:59.665
-You did what?
-What?

08:59.748 --> 09:01.834
-It was ill-advised, I know.
-Not to mention dangerous.

09:01.917 --> 09:03.502
- And illegal.
- Yeah--

09:03.586 --> 09:04.712
It's all that. All of that.

09:04.795 --> 09:07.798
And I don't need a lecture or I will
take those coffees back, okay?

09:10.218 --> 09:11.344
Thank you.

09:12.803 --> 09:15.098
Look, it's not just about the press.

09:15.181 --> 09:18.434
The DA's office released their statement
and it's full of holes, too.

09:18.517 --> 09:21.895
Something big is going on here, guys,
and it all circles back to Frank Castle.

09:21.979 --> 09:23.314
-Oh, no, no, no--
-Foggy--

09:23.397 --> 09:26.067
No, come on, we successfully dodged
a metaphorical bullet

09:26.150 --> 09:27.443
and quite a few literal ones.

09:27.526 --> 09:30.279
We need to be done with the crazy, guys.

09:30.363 --> 09:31.905
We need normal.

09:37.245 --> 09:38.371
I'm sorry.

09:40.498 --> 09:41.874
I'm really sorry if I--

09:41.957 --> 09:43.917
-I pushed it too far.
-It's okay.

09:44.001 --> 09:45.586
I just...

09:45.669 --> 09:48.464
Uh, I don't think you're wrong
about Castle, but...

09:49.590 --> 09:51.134
it's really simple, Karen.

09:51.217 --> 09:52.968
Just... I don't want you to get hurt.

09:56.555 --> 09:58.641
So, uh...

09:58.724 --> 10:00.434
Last night.

10:00.518 --> 10:01.894
Last night?

10:03.354 --> 10:05.106
I don't-- What happened last night?

10:05.189 --> 10:06.524
- At Josie's? With Foggy?
- You--

10:06.607 --> 10:07.733
-Did something happen?
-Yeah.

10:07.816 --> 10:09.485
-Anything else? I don't--
-Yeah?

10:12.738 --> 10:14.031
Yeah, it was great.

10:16.659 --> 10:19.828
And I like to think I can do better,
if we're still on for dinner.

10:19.912 --> 10:21.289
Uh, yeah.

10:21.372 --> 10:22.998
It's a date.

10:23.081 --> 10:24.417
Holy shit!

10:26.043 --> 10:28.003
-That was the bank.
-Oh, no.

10:28.086 --> 10:31.006
No, it's... all good.
There was a deposit.

10:31.089 --> 10:32.675
A big one.

10:32.758 --> 10:34.635
What? Uh...

10:34.718 --> 10:37.054
Um, yeah...

10:37.138 --> 10:39.640
Yeah, uh, do me a favor,
don't spend any of it.

10:39.723 --> 10:41.058
-Why not?
-God...

10:41.142 --> 10:44.061
I was hit up by a potential client
yesterday, so, I just--

10:44.145 --> 10:45.896
Is it dirty money?
Are we doing that again?

10:45.979 --> 10:47.773
No! No, it's nothing like that.
It's just, um...

10:47.856 --> 10:49.942
I'm not sure
it's gonna work out, let me...

10:50.025 --> 10:52.110
Let me get into it, I'll--
I'll get back to you.

10:54.822 --> 10:59.368
Hey, I'm gonna have a Macallan, neat,
and the lady will have, uh...

10:59.452 --> 11:01.662
another vodka martini.

11:01.745 --> 11:04.039
-Perceptive.
-Thank you, I try.

11:04.122 --> 11:05.791
But I can order my own drinks.

11:06.792 --> 11:08.794
Tequila. Mezcal, if you have it.

11:10.629 --> 11:13.382
So, thanks for your help.

11:13.466 --> 11:16.176
It's hard to find reliable
security these days.

11:19.347 --> 11:20.806
Nice shoes.

11:20.889 --> 11:22.266
What?

11:22.350 --> 11:25.478
Wingtips. Good call.
Shine them yourself?

11:25.561 --> 11:27.980
How'd you know?

11:28.814 --> 11:30.566
You're not exactly a tough read.

11:31.484 --> 11:32.568
I...

11:32.651 --> 11:33.986
could surprise you.

11:35.070 --> 11:36.239
Doubt it.

11:37.323 --> 11:38.407
All right.

11:39.950 --> 11:41.702
You, uh, wanna give it a try?

11:43.912 --> 11:45.080
Okay.

11:45.163 --> 11:47.625
You desperately want
to belong somewhere...

11:48.459 --> 11:50.127
with someone,

11:50.210 --> 11:53.381
which is the real reason why
you sneak into fancy faculty parties.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.716
Not because you're sick of your ramen

11:55.799 --> 11:57.676
- and video games routine.

11:58.886 --> 12:02.222
And now, your mind is racing.

12:03.724 --> 12:08.354
You're wondering what you can possibly
say or do to keep me on the line,

12:08.437 --> 12:12.149
because the last thing you want
is to spend the rest of the evening

12:12.232 --> 12:15.152
with that scotch
and that shaggy-haired friend of yours.

12:17.696 --> 12:19.365
You know what your problem is?

12:19.448 --> 12:20.491
You're pretty.

12:20.574 --> 12:23.201
You even work the blind thing.

12:23.286 --> 12:24.412
But you're dumb.

12:24.495 --> 12:26.997
You lost before you even
stepped to the plate.

12:30.250 --> 12:33.421
You get all of that
from a pair of old wingtips?

12:34.254 --> 12:35.881
Quick study.

12:40.969 --> 12:43.806
- You wanna know what I think?
- Tell me.

12:44.973 --> 12:46.684
I think the game's just beginning.

12:49.520 --> 12:52.481
Because despite your artisan tequilas

12:52.565 --> 12:54.775
and charm-school manners...

12:56.026 --> 13:00.573
Despite being richer than God and having
the whole world at your fingertips...

13:02.450 --> 13:04.076
you're just bored.

13:06.829 --> 13:07.830
Really?

13:07.913 --> 13:11.124
Bored enough to spend your time
studying a stranger's shoes.

13:14.252 --> 13:18.173
See, I think you were dying on the vine
of this tight-ass party,

13:18.256 --> 13:21.510
because Daddy's money can't buy you
the one thing you really need.

13:23.887 --> 13:25.639
And what's that?

13:25.723 --> 13:27.516
The unexpected.

13:31.979 --> 13:33.981
Maybe you're not so dumb.

13:35.358 --> 13:36.859
Elektra Natchios.

13:37.610 --> 13:38.986
Matt Murdock.

13:44.658 --> 13:46.076
Let's go, Matthew.

13:55.127 --> 13:56.379
On your left.

14:08.766 --> 14:11.351
--Do you like it?

14:11.435 --> 14:13.854
--Sounds expensive.

14:13.937 --> 14:15.355
You have good ears.

14:19.109 --> 14:21.779
-Is it yours?
-It is.

14:21.862 --> 14:23.113
Until we get caught.

14:33.999 --> 14:35.000
Mr. Tower?

14:35.083 --> 14:38.045
Uh, I wish you'd called.
I'd have set something up.

14:38.128 --> 14:41.173
-Are they in?
-Uh, just the Nelson half.

14:41.256 --> 14:42.466
What's the problem?

14:42.550 --> 14:43.967
We need to talk.

14:44.051 --> 14:45.928
In private.

14:52.350 --> 14:54.728
You know, it's really not
a good idea to piss her off.

14:55.854 --> 14:58.732
So, what can I do
for the Assistant District Attorney?

14:58.816 --> 15:01.485
It's more what I can do for you,
Mr. Nelson.

15:01.569 --> 15:03.571
We need all your files on the Grote case.

15:03.654 --> 15:06.615
Notes, interviews, any and all
recordings and e-mails.

15:06.699 --> 15:08.116
And in return, we get...

15:08.200 --> 15:09.702
I convince District Attorney Reyes

15:09.785 --> 15:12.455
to scratch the names Nelson
and Murdock off her shit-list.

15:12.538 --> 15:14.206
Wow.

15:14.289 --> 15:15.874
There's an actual list?

15:15.958 --> 15:17.084
-Mr. Nelson, I--
-I'm sorry.

15:17.167 --> 15:20.963
Believe me, the sooner this Punisher
mess is off our plate, the better.

15:21.046 --> 15:23.716
So... show me a subpoena, and...

15:25.801 --> 15:27.219
Is there a problem?

15:30.598 --> 15:33.391
Are you really going to make me
jump through hoops for this?

15:33.476 --> 15:37.938
Trust me, there's nothing I'd rather do
more than cooperate with your office.

15:38.021 --> 15:41.484
But a legal firm sharing privileged
communications with a client,

15:41.567 --> 15:43.861
I mean, even a deceased one,
without a court order?

15:43.944 --> 15:46.447
I've seen lawyers get disbarred for less.

15:46.530 --> 15:51.076
And I don't know about you, but I worked
really hard for my law degree.

15:51.159 --> 15:52.786
Nights and everything.

15:58.250 --> 15:59.877
Reyes...

15:59.960 --> 16:04.214
she staked all her political chips
on the conviction of this Punisher freak.

16:05.215 --> 16:06.592
Now, if things'll go her way,

16:06.675 --> 16:09.094
there'll be an opening
in the District Attorney's office

16:09.177 --> 16:10.721
in the not-so-distant future.

16:11.639 --> 16:14.016
And DA Tower has a nice ring to it.

16:14.099 --> 16:17.394
Now, I'd start considering
the benefits that could accrue

16:17.478 --> 16:19.522
if your firm were more...

16:19.605 --> 16:20.814
cooperative.

16:21.774 --> 16:24.401
Like I said...

16:24.485 --> 16:28.071
show me a subpoena,
and I'll cooperate like a son of a bitch.

16:32.868 --> 16:34.995
Reyes is gonna roll over you like a tank.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.329
You keep saying that.

16:36.830 --> 16:37.831
And yet...

16:38.749 --> 16:40.458
still kinda here.

17:21.458 --> 17:23.460
I'm gonna have to pay for that.

17:23.544 --> 17:24.920
I'll stake you.

17:26.964 --> 17:28.591
So this is the famous Fogwell's.

17:28.674 --> 17:30.718
Yeah, breathe it in fast.

17:32.845 --> 17:35.931
If we get arrested for breaking
and entering, the fun kinda stops.

17:36.014 --> 17:37.307
Shows what you know.

17:38.225 --> 17:39.643
I haven't been here in a while.

17:41.019 --> 17:42.896
I bet nothing's moved.

17:48.318 --> 17:50.571
-Thanks.
-So tell me.

17:51.488 --> 17:54.366
-How does a blind man box?
-Oh, uh...

17:54.449 --> 17:56.702
I don't...
I can't.

17:56.785 --> 17:58.704
My dad, he was the boxer.

17:58.787 --> 18:00.413
Was?

18:00.497 --> 18:02.457
Yeah, he died.

18:02.540 --> 18:03.667
I'm sorry.

18:04.710 --> 18:08.005
I just come here to...
breathe in the smell of sweat.

18:09.297 --> 18:12.134
Hear the clank of the chains
holding the bags.

18:12.217 --> 18:13.551
Remember him.

18:15.303 --> 18:17.681
You never saw your father fight.

18:17.765 --> 18:21.309
Oh, I saw him get his ass beat
more times than I can count.

18:23.395 --> 18:25.480
I wasn't born blind.
That's a...

18:25.563 --> 18:26.982
whole other story.

18:32.487 --> 18:34.239
Did he die in the ring?

18:35.448 --> 18:36.784
Uh...

18:36.867 --> 18:39.161
No, boxing didn't kill him.

18:39.244 --> 18:40.328
What did?

18:41.705 --> 18:43.081
Organized crime.

18:44.541 --> 18:46.001
Like a mob hit?

18:47.628 --> 18:49.838
- Was he a criminal?
- No.

18:51.214 --> 18:53.634
But I guess you could say he rubbed
some people the wrong way.

18:54.927 --> 18:56.428
Someone in particular?

19:00.015 --> 19:01.684
Uh, yeah.

19:03.018 --> 19:05.854
A guy named Roscoe Sweeney.

19:05.938 --> 19:08.106
I don't know if he pulled the trigger,
but he gave the order.

19:09.149 --> 19:11.443
Did you ever try to find
that piece of shit?

19:12.527 --> 19:14.196
Yeah, once. When I was a kid.

19:14.279 --> 19:17.532
Got nothing.
Learned to live with it.

19:18.533 --> 19:20.035
He probably went underground.

19:20.118 --> 19:21.829
Well, six feet, I hope.

19:24.164 --> 19:26.166
You don't have to feel sorry for me.

19:26.249 --> 19:27.500
I don't.

19:27.584 --> 19:29.377
Are you sure?

19:29.461 --> 19:30.587
Yes.

19:32.464 --> 19:33.674
I've seen it.

19:33.757 --> 19:37.803
Here and there,
over the past few weeks.

19:39.054 --> 19:41.932
You're so much more than you let on.

19:43.308 --> 19:44.977
Okay.

19:45.060 --> 19:47.062
I feel like I've told you more
in the last ten minutes

19:47.145 --> 19:49.647
than I've told anyone else in ten years.

19:49.732 --> 19:51.524
Ha!

19:51.608 --> 19:53.276
I knew it.

19:54.569 --> 19:56.613
- You knew what?

19:57.698 --> 20:00.701
You said you were blind.

20:00.784 --> 20:02.703
No, you said I was blind.

20:02.786 --> 20:04.747
So you can see?

20:04.830 --> 20:06.164
It's complicated.

20:11.920 --> 20:14.214
What about you?
You said you took ballet lessons.

20:14.297 --> 20:15.340
I did.

20:15.423 --> 20:16.674
In the winters,

20:16.759 --> 20:19.677
when my capoeira master
returned to Angola.

20:28.603 --> 20:29.730
Muay Thai?

20:29.813 --> 20:32.065
-Every other Thursday.
-Of course.

20:36.153 --> 20:37.988
You got me.

20:39.239 --> 20:40.490
Get me back.

20:41.408 --> 20:42.409
Get me!

20:49.750 --> 20:51.084
I win.

20:53.295 --> 20:55.130
Yeah, first round, maybe.

20:56.298 --> 20:57.758
We're just getting started.

23:30.785 --> 23:32.787
Ms. Natchios, good afternoon.

23:32.870 --> 23:35.082
Good afternoon.
You can sit.

23:38.501 --> 23:40.963
We hope you know how valuable
your business is

23:41.046 --> 23:42.755
to the Roxxon Corporation.

23:42.839 --> 23:43.840
Thank you.

23:44.591 --> 23:48.303
This is Stan Gibson.
He's the money man for our Japanese arm.

23:48.386 --> 23:50.763
So, he'll have the answers
you're looking for.

23:50.847 --> 23:53.516
Whether or not he can put them
in terms you'll understand

23:53.600 --> 23:55.810
is another matter.

23:57.270 --> 24:00.190
Let's all prepare to be dazzled, shall we?

24:07.030 --> 24:09.241
-Excuse me, uh, Mr. Ellison?
-Yeah?

24:09.324 --> 24:11.159
Sorry, I don't mean to interrupt.
My name is Karen Page.

24:11.243 --> 24:12.827
-I was a friend of--
-Ben.

24:12.910 --> 24:14.329
Yeah, I remember.

24:15.372 --> 24:17.832
Look, I think that
I owe you an apology.

24:17.915 --> 24:19.376
-At the funeral, I thought that you--
-Forget it.

24:20.710 --> 24:22.962
Look, Ben...

24:23.046 --> 24:25.548
- Ben was a real pain in my ass.

24:25.632 --> 24:28.260
So it follows that his friends
would be, too.

24:29.594 --> 24:30.970
What can I do for you?

24:31.054 --> 24:33.181
Well, I don't think
you're gonna like my answer.

24:33.265 --> 24:35.017
I'd like to talk to you
about the Frank Castle article.

24:35.100 --> 24:37.769
-I know, terrifying.
-Also inaccurate.

24:38.853 --> 24:40.855
Look...

24:40.938 --> 24:43.733
that article was corroborated
by multiple sources.

24:43.816 --> 24:47.195
NYPD, DA's office,
we even had some eyewitnesses.

24:47.279 --> 24:49.281
Yes, everything that
you reported is correct.

24:49.364 --> 24:50.948
It's what you haven't reported
that bothers me.

24:51.074 --> 24:53.076
The article is inaccurate by omission.

24:55.453 --> 24:56.996
Okay, come here, come here.

24:57.080 --> 24:58.748
Excuse me, please.

24:58.831 --> 24:59.916
Go.

25:02.252 --> 25:05.630
Right, did you know that two years ago,
Lieutenant Frank Castle

25:05.713 --> 25:07.924
was awarded the Navy Cross
for his service in Afghanistan, right?

25:08.007 --> 25:09.842
That's second only
to the Medal of Honor.

25:09.926 --> 25:11.261
This guy is a war hero.

25:11.344 --> 25:13.221
Military history
is the first thing we search

25:13.305 --> 25:15.265
whenever there's a mass shooting.

25:15.348 --> 25:19.186
So, we know that he was a Marine recruit,
and we know that he went in as a kid,

25:19.269 --> 25:21.521
but there's no evidence
that he actually served.

25:21.604 --> 25:23.440
I've seen the medal,

25:23.523 --> 25:24.941
engraved with Castle's name,

25:25.024 --> 25:27.277
next to a photograph of him
shaking the secretary's hand.

25:28.736 --> 25:30.947
Are you suggesting
that his work was classified?

25:31.030 --> 25:33.241
I don't know, but--
but I would assume.

25:33.325 --> 25:35.285
Don't assume. Where'd you see it?

25:36.494 --> 25:38.455
Uh, not important.

25:38.538 --> 25:39.872
Pretty important.

25:39.956 --> 25:41.999
Look, your article also states
that he had no known relatives,

25:42.084 --> 25:43.751
but every paper in New York says that.

25:43.835 --> 25:46.879
Well, that was in the press briefing
issued by the DA's office.

25:46.963 --> 25:48.215
He had a family.

25:49.257 --> 25:52.802
He had a wife, Maria Elizabeth,
a daughter, Lisa Barbara,

25:52.885 --> 25:54.721
and a son, Frank Junior.

25:55.763 --> 25:57.682
-Had?
-All dead.

25:57.765 --> 26:00.685
Killed around the same time
that Castle was hospitalized

26:00.768 --> 26:02.270
for a gunshot wound to the head.

26:02.354 --> 26:03.355
What, so...

26:03.438 --> 26:06.316
What, you're saying that he murdered
his family and then shot himself?

26:06.399 --> 26:08.943
Some sort of PTSD murder-suicide attempt?

26:09.026 --> 26:10.027
No, see, if that's what had happened,

26:10.112 --> 26:11.363
the DA would have put it in her brief,

26:11.446 --> 26:12.905
in flashing neon if she could,

26:12.989 --> 26:15.867
because that supports her story
that he's a psychopath.

26:17.702 --> 26:19.912
So, what do you think really happened?

26:20.747 --> 26:23.250
That's what I don't know yet.

26:23.333 --> 26:26.461
But if I could dig through your files
or I could check into your back issues,

26:26.544 --> 26:28.004
maybe I could figure it out.

26:29.005 --> 26:32.217
And anything that I find,
anything that I can prove--

26:32.300 --> 26:34.136
The Bulletin gets the exclusive.

26:35.262 --> 26:36.388
Deal.

26:37.514 --> 26:38.723
Okay, deal.

26:38.806 --> 26:42.269
Uh-uh... don't do any somersaults yet.

26:49.234 --> 26:51.153
All the, uh...

26:51.236 --> 26:53.696
All the servers were completely
wiped in the incident.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.698
--Decades, just...

26:55.782 --> 26:56.866
gone.

26:56.949 --> 26:59.911
So, um, we keep hard copies
of everything now.

26:59.994 --> 27:01.621
Jeez! Are they in any kind of order?

27:01.704 --> 27:03.290
Um, you know, roughly.

27:03.373 --> 27:05.542
I would... I would start, uh, down here.

27:05.625 --> 27:07.502
-Okay. Uh, thanks.
-Uh-huh.

27:11.214 --> 27:13.007
- What?
- Oh...

27:13.090 --> 27:15.718
Uh, nothing, I'm just thinking, uh,
somewhere...

27:15.802 --> 27:19.472
Ben Urich is looking down,
and just...

27:19.556 --> 27:21.849
- getting a real kick out of all this.

27:23.226 --> 27:24.519
Have fun.

27:35.988 --> 27:38.825
I'm sure you all have
places to be, things to do.

27:38.908 --> 27:41.619
With your wives,
your mistresses...

27:41.703 --> 27:44.080
--But I have questions.

27:46.165 --> 27:48.460
And this subsidiary,
what is it exactly?

27:48.543 --> 27:51.546
- A medical company.
- And they do?

27:51.629 --> 27:54.173
- Studies.
- How specific.

27:54.257 --> 27:56.759
Research for pain relievers,
treatments for diseases.

27:56.843 --> 27:59.637
The names of which
I mostly can't pronounce.

27:59.721 --> 28:01.931
How do you determine
your acquisitions?

28:02.014 --> 28:03.933
- Well--

28:05.101 --> 28:06.102
Excuse me.

28:11.233 --> 28:12.734
There's an issue with our server.

28:12.817 --> 28:14.402
Someone has
hacked into the server.

28:14.486 --> 28:17.239
Possibly internal, we don't know yet,
security is looking into it.

28:17.322 --> 28:23.370
If it's an external threat,
I'm sure they can trace the IP address

28:23.453 --> 28:28.250
and deal with the "problem" face-to-face.

28:28.333 --> 28:32.169
But I'm more concerned
about what information

28:32.254 --> 28:38.301
they can pull from Roxxon's system
when it is offline.

28:38.385 --> 28:40.637
I'm terribly sorry,
something has come up.

28:40.720 --> 28:43.306
Could we reconvene at another time?

28:43.390 --> 28:44.849
Absolutely.

28:45.683 --> 28:47.227
Thank you.

28:48.019 --> 28:50.355
I'll have someone
escort you downstairs.

28:50.438 --> 28:51.939
Thank you.

28:52.023 --> 28:54.817
In this city, a girl needs
all the help she can get.

29:02.199 --> 29:03.493
Why is it gray?

29:03.576 --> 29:05.870
One of life's mysteries.

29:17.382 --> 29:19.384
They were out of olives.

29:19.467 --> 29:21.928
So?

29:22.970 --> 29:24.681
So...

29:25.222 --> 29:26.474
What?

29:27.475 --> 29:28.893
It was a hard day.

29:28.976 --> 29:31.521
I thought we could catch up,
you know, have a drink.

29:31.604 --> 29:33.022
Just...

29:33.105 --> 29:34.231
be like we were.

29:34.316 --> 29:35.983
Normal.

29:37.444 --> 29:39.279
I haven't heard from you in months.

29:40.488 --> 29:41.739
Well, that's...

29:41.823 --> 29:43.616
not all that abnormal, right?

29:45.618 --> 29:47.787
Yeah, I guess you're right.

29:47.870 --> 29:51.333
Let's get trashed and tell each other
our sob stories. You first.

29:51.999 --> 29:53.585
Matt's dating our office assistant.

29:54.502 --> 29:56.421
The cute one?
Blonde, totally your type?

29:56.504 --> 29:57.839
-Yeah.
-Mmm.

29:58.423 --> 29:59.674
The correct answer is,

29:59.757 --> 30:02.802
"No one is as perfect for me
as you, Marci."

30:02.885 --> 30:03.970
Gets worse.

30:04.053 --> 30:05.888
We lost two clients in the last hour.

30:05.972 --> 30:08.099
Oh, it's kinda like when I lost the job
at Landman and Zack.

30:08.182 --> 30:10.977
-Thank God HC and B was hiring.
-No, I'm serious.

30:11.060 --> 30:12.228
It's the DA.

30:13.145 --> 30:15.815
I called her bluff on a case
she's building against the Punisher

30:15.898 --> 30:16.983
and she doubled down.

30:17.567 --> 30:18.943
She's coming after us.

30:19.611 --> 30:20.612
I see.

30:21.529 --> 30:23.865
You didn't call me for a social drink.

30:23.948 --> 30:25.700
You called me for help.

30:26.618 --> 30:29.621
That feels more normal.

30:37.545 --> 30:38.671
Fine.

30:41.633 --> 30:43.885
Rumors among my new partners?

30:43.968 --> 30:45.970
Reyes has her sights
on the mayor's office.

30:48.348 --> 30:50.307
- This is my shocked face.

30:50.392 --> 30:52.519
And she aims to do so by...

30:52.602 --> 30:55.480
building a platform
on Frank Castle's conviction.

30:55.563 --> 30:57.106
She gets him...

30:57.189 --> 31:00.485
she sets precedent against
these other vigilantes popping up.

31:00.568 --> 31:03.195
One in our office is already
under serious scrutiny,

31:03.279 --> 31:05.490
lady by the name of Jessica Jones.

31:05.573 --> 31:07.450
Oh, and you know who I bet is next?

31:07.534 --> 31:09.076
The horny one.

31:09.160 --> 31:10.787
It's... Daredevil.

31:12.497 --> 31:14.416
- You think it'll work?

31:15.249 --> 31:20.713
She's gonna turn city-wide disaster
into damn fine lemonade.

31:20.797 --> 31:23.049
It's her big power play.

31:23.132 --> 31:24.717
It's gonna work.

31:43.152 --> 31:44.904
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:46.238 --> 31:49.366
It's been... whoa, three hours.

31:49.451 --> 31:50.993
Oh, God.

31:51.077 --> 31:53.455
And I'm almost late for dinner.

31:53.538 --> 31:55.748
-Thanks.
-Any luck?

31:56.833 --> 31:59.586
Well, these are all the papers
from the week that Castle was shot.

31:59.669 --> 32:01.421
I've been through each one
of them three times,

32:01.504 --> 32:03.923
and there's not a single mention
of Castle, his family...

32:04.006 --> 32:06.092
Not even a John Doe that matches.

32:06.175 --> 32:07.384
Just nothing.

32:07.469 --> 32:09.721
Well, you know,
people are shot every day.

32:09.804 --> 32:11.347
It doesn't always make the paper.

32:11.431 --> 32:13.307
Cleavered Cleavers.

32:13.390 --> 32:14.434
What's that?

32:14.517 --> 32:17.479
Ah, just an old newspaper adage, right?

32:17.562 --> 32:19.772
If horror befalls a family
you can paint as all-American,

32:19.856 --> 32:21.441
it makes the front page.

32:21.524 --> 32:24.235
So, if the Castles are not in this paper,

32:24.318 --> 32:26.403
it's because somebody
wants to keep it quiet.

32:26.488 --> 32:27.864
Well, shit.

32:30.533 --> 32:32.243
April 14th.

32:33.536 --> 32:35.538
When was the Castle family murdered?

32:35.622 --> 32:38.082
Well, I figure it's gotta be
sometime that week, right?

32:38.165 --> 32:41.919
You know, I cannot remember my...
my kids' birthdays, but...

32:42.003 --> 32:46.132
violent, soul-sucking events
are just seared into my brain.

32:46.215 --> 32:47.509
Figures, right?

32:48.635 --> 32:50.261
Ah, yes, yes.

32:50.344 --> 32:53.055
Okay, gang-on-gang violence.

32:53.139 --> 32:55.391
No civilians were reported injured,
so nobody cared.

32:55.475 --> 32:57.519
It took me a week
to get this in the paper.

32:57.602 --> 32:58.770
Here.

33:00.563 --> 33:02.273
Three gangs, Central Park, mid-day.

33:02.356 --> 33:04.817
They shot each other to shit.
It was a total massacre.

33:04.901 --> 33:07.444
Mexican Cartel,
Dogs of Hell...

33:07.529 --> 33:09.113
- Kitchen Irish.
- ...Kitchen Irish.

33:09.196 --> 33:11.240
-Those were all the three--
-That the Punisher gunned down.

33:11.323 --> 33:13.409
-There's gotta be a connection, right?
-Mmm-hmm. Right.

33:15.620 --> 33:16.746
-Oh, my God.
-What?

33:16.829 --> 33:17.914
Oh, my God.

33:24.879 --> 33:26.756
This is it.

33:26.839 --> 33:29.091
This is where his family was killed.

33:29.175 --> 33:31.218
Shit, what do I do now?

33:31.302 --> 33:32.512
Confirm it.

33:34.096 --> 33:36.265
-Can I borrow this?
-Yeah, sure.

33:36.348 --> 33:37.767
Just a little reminder...

33:37.850 --> 33:40.102
Bulletin gets the exclusive, right?

33:40.186 --> 33:42.479
-You got it, boss.
-Wait, you're going now?

33:42.564 --> 33:43.690
Really?

33:50.279 --> 33:52.198
Do you drink wine?

33:52.281 --> 33:53.825
I should know that.

33:54.742 --> 33:57.870
I don't drink anything
they don't serve at Josie's.

33:57.954 --> 34:00.456
Yeah, well,
I don't see swill on the menu.

34:05.336 --> 34:06.588
-So how was--
-So what did--

34:06.671 --> 34:07.839
-I'm sorry--
-I was just gonna--

34:09.340 --> 34:10.758
Uh, you go ahead.
Go, go first.

34:11.968 --> 34:13.720
How was your day?

34:13.803 --> 34:14.804
Fine.

34:14.887 --> 34:16.973
Uh, yeah,
just a regular day at the office.

34:17.056 --> 34:19.058
Well, it's a nice change of pace, right?

34:19.141 --> 34:20.184
Not being shot at?

34:20.267 --> 34:23.395
- That's gotta feel good.
- Yeah.

34:24.939 --> 34:27.399
You, how's the, uh, new client?

34:27.483 --> 34:29.986
Uh, yeah, um...

34:31.571 --> 34:33.072
Nothing I haven't seen before.

34:33.781 --> 34:35.908
I seriously doubt it's gonna pan out,
but that's...

34:35.992 --> 34:37.619
That's fine.

34:37.702 --> 34:39.286
Okay, good.

34:42.624 --> 34:45.042
- Well, that covers work.

34:46.502 --> 34:48.045
Uh, well, it's a start.

34:50.715 --> 34:54.260
-Um, I'll be back in just a minute, um...
-Yeah.

34:54.343 --> 34:56.888
- Order something fantastic.
- Sure.

35:05.021 --> 35:06.022
-Sir?
-Look.

35:06.105 --> 35:08.650
If I had to seem like I knew everything
there is to know about wines

35:08.733 --> 35:11.152
in the next 60 seconds, what would I...
what would I order?

35:11.235 --> 35:12.904
-Matthew Murdock?
-Yeah.

35:12.987 --> 35:14.280
You have a call.

35:15.281 --> 35:16.407
Oh, thanks.

35:17.950 --> 35:19.201
This is Murdock.

35:20.202 --> 35:22.288
Sorry to bother you
while you're out,

35:22.371 --> 35:25.207
but you have a few moments
before she returns, right?

35:27.376 --> 35:28.670
What do you want from me?

35:29.671 --> 35:31.798
You should ask yourself
the same question.

35:31.881 --> 35:34.050
That rooftop act was cute.

35:34.133 --> 35:36.678
Yeah, nothing compared
to your damsel-in-distress one.

35:36.761 --> 35:41.057
Oh, you're right.
I didn't actually need you.

35:41.140 --> 35:43.184
I told you,
maybe I just missed you.

35:43.267 --> 35:45.144
But don't worry,
you can keep the money.

35:47.438 --> 35:48.480
Aw...

35:48.564 --> 35:49.565
Go to hell.

35:49.649 --> 35:53.402
If you really want to be done,
consider this me firing you.

36:17.551 --> 36:19.721
Any time you want to drive...

36:19.804 --> 36:23.224
I think it's illegal, driving under
the influence of blindness.

36:23.307 --> 36:24.684
You're the future lawyer.

36:24.767 --> 36:26.936
Yeah, I should start
going to class again, then.

36:27.019 --> 36:29.772
-Hey, where are we?
-A house.

36:30.982 --> 36:33.192
Yeah. Is it yours?

36:33.275 --> 36:35.945
Oh, God, no.
I'd die in the suburbs.

36:36.028 --> 36:38.197
No, this charming little chateau

36:38.280 --> 36:42.118
belongs to one of my father's
many work associates,

36:42.201 --> 36:46.455
who's currently off to Monte Carlo,
where prostitution is legal.

36:47.456 --> 36:48.708
So...

36:48.791 --> 36:50.667
you have the keys, right?

36:54.546 --> 36:57.466
Welcome home, darling.
Dinner's almost ready.

37:00.094 --> 37:01.553
- Tiny kitchen.
- Mmm-hmm.

37:03.765 --> 37:05.892
Okay, so we have, uh...

37:05.975 --> 37:09.645
truffles, saucissons, cornichons...

37:09.729 --> 37:10.980
-Baby pickles.
-No.

37:11.063 --> 37:12.398
-Ugh!
-Okay, got it.

37:12.481 --> 37:14.150
No cornichons.

37:14.233 --> 37:15.359
So...

37:17.111 --> 37:19.530
-when you graduate...
-Mmm-hmm.

37:19.613 --> 37:22.199
-...and we get married...
-Wow.

37:22.283 --> 37:25.661
...and we buy a house...
I mean, houses, sorry.

37:25.745 --> 37:28.164
Santorini, San Sebastian...

37:28.247 --> 37:29.999
Paris, for when we're
feeling cosmopolitan.

37:31.208 --> 37:32.960
This...

37:33.044 --> 37:34.545
is how we'll live.

37:40.176 --> 37:41.510
And what about the kids?

37:41.593 --> 37:43.470
What are we gonna do with them?

37:43.554 --> 37:46.390
Oh, you know, sweet little Ellie, and...

37:46.473 --> 37:48.935
her simpleton brother, Matty Junior...

37:49.018 --> 37:50.770
--...can cook and clean

37:50.853 --> 37:53.480
and stock the fridge for us,
so we can use...

37:53.564 --> 37:55.942
our time doing better things.

37:57.193 --> 37:58.735
Like sex?

37:58.820 --> 38:01.072
Exactly like sex.

38:01.155 --> 38:03.157
- Who's thirsty?

38:07.995 --> 38:09.121
- Hey.
- Mmm?

38:09.205 --> 38:11.791
-Is it good?
-What?

38:11.874 --> 38:13.042
This.

38:13.793 --> 38:15.795
All of this, this, uh...

38:15.878 --> 38:17.629
life.

38:17.713 --> 38:19.506
It's fantastic.

38:22.093 --> 38:26.848
But I would trade it all in
for a lifetime of smelling your skin.

38:39.401 --> 38:40.486
Cheers.

38:49.661 --> 38:52.039
-Sounded expensive.
-I'm guessing.

38:53.040 --> 38:54.291
I don't care.

38:59.171 --> 39:01.090
- Get me?

39:01.173 --> 39:02.967
I do, I get you.

39:03.050 --> 39:04.301
When are you going to learn?

39:05.594 --> 39:06.762
Get me.

39:11.308 --> 39:12.684
I have learned.

39:14.186 --> 39:15.396
You know me.

39:16.730 --> 39:19.275
Like no one else ever has.
And I know you.

39:21.152 --> 39:22.236
We belong together.

39:30.202 --> 39:31.412
Someone's here.

39:31.495 --> 39:33.455
Daddy's friend
probably ran out of Viagra--

39:33.539 --> 39:34.665
Shh...

39:34.748 --> 39:36.417
They're footsteps. Moving fast.
Let me go check.

39:36.500 --> 39:39.628
No, no, no, no, no.
You stay here.

39:39.711 --> 39:41.505
If I explain everything,
he won't be mad.

39:41.588 --> 39:42.589
I promise.

40:02.401 --> 40:04.361
Matthew, you remember
Roscoe Sweeney,

40:04.445 --> 40:06.363
the son of a bitch who killed your father?

40:10.159 --> 40:11.743
--Hey.

40:11.827 --> 40:13.287
-Hey.
-Everything okay?

40:13.370 --> 40:16.332
- Yeah, they ran out of wine.
- No.

40:16.415 --> 40:17.583
Wait, seriously?

40:19.418 --> 40:20.586
Matt...

40:23.339 --> 40:25.632
I don't...
I don't like this place, you know?

40:28.844 --> 40:30.804
Is it the place? Or is it--

40:30.887 --> 40:32.223
It's definitely not you.

40:34.016 --> 40:35.476
-You're sure?
-Yeah.

40:35.559 --> 40:36.893
I'm positive.

40:40.731 --> 40:43.359
Come on.
I know where we can go.

40:44.944 --> 40:47.029
- Thank you.
- Wow, this smells amazing.

40:48.655 --> 40:50.324
- What is it?
- Um...

40:50.407 --> 40:52.284
Who cares?
They have wine.

40:52.368 --> 40:53.785
Right.

40:53.869 --> 40:55.079
That's...

40:55.162 --> 40:58.165
You know, I've always felt
more comfortable with the cheap stuff.

40:58.249 --> 40:59.833
-You know?
-Yeah?

40:59.916 --> 41:01.710
Well, here, I'll drink to that.

41:06.132 --> 41:07.341
--Cheap stuff.

41:07.424 --> 41:09.468
--Cheap stuff.

41:10.927 --> 41:13.973
You know, I never even had
Indian food until a few months ago.

41:14.056 --> 41:16.308
- How is that possible?

41:16.392 --> 41:19.103
Well, my hometown in Vermont
had about 400 people,

41:19.186 --> 41:21.938
so the most ethnic food it offered
was French fries.

41:24.233 --> 41:27.028
So that's why you, uh, came to New York?
For the... for the food?

41:28.070 --> 41:29.613
Uh, no.

41:29.696 --> 41:31.490
Although, if I knew
places like this existed,

41:31.573 --> 41:33.200
I'd have left Vermont ages ago.

41:34.994 --> 41:37.538
-You see, that's why I love this city.
-Hmm?

41:37.621 --> 41:39.248
I've lived here my whole life, and...

41:40.832 --> 41:42.501
the place never stops
unfolding new secrets.

41:42.584 --> 41:43.585
Hmm.

41:44.670 --> 41:46.130
Yeah, you know...

41:46.213 --> 41:48.549
despite the crime,

41:48.632 --> 41:50.092
and the darkness,

41:50.176 --> 41:52.803
every once in a while,
New York makes me feel...

41:53.845 --> 41:55.222
Like, safe?

41:55.306 --> 41:57.141
- Yes, is that weird?
- Well...

41:57.224 --> 41:58.559
-Huh.
-I get it.

42:00.144 --> 42:01.853
I wish you could see this place.

42:03.439 --> 42:06.567
I can, if you describe it to me.

42:07.693 --> 42:10.696
So, anyways,
my favorite part...

42:10.779 --> 42:12.198
is the ceiling.

42:12.281 --> 42:18.162
So, it's literally dripping
with thousands of lights.

42:18.245 --> 42:20.081
They're shaped like chili peppers...

42:20.164 --> 42:24.626
which sounds really tacky, I know,
but it's, um, it's not.

42:25.836 --> 42:27.754
Just...

42:27.838 --> 42:29.631
It's magic.

42:36.930 --> 42:38.682
This is me.

42:43.562 --> 42:44.938
Are you sure you don't...

42:45.021 --> 42:46.648
- live two more blocks?

42:46.732 --> 42:49.025
-Maybe three?
-I wish.

42:51.153 --> 42:53.280
We could sit.

42:53.364 --> 42:54.365
Yeah.

43:06.835 --> 43:09.130
- All right, I'm gonna kiss ya.

43:30.567 --> 43:32.027
You could come up...

43:33.404 --> 43:34.655
if you like.

43:37.616 --> 43:38.992
I would love to.

43:42.954 --> 43:44.248
But you won't.

43:45.916 --> 43:47.251
Not tonight.

43:50.254 --> 43:51.505
-It's okay.
-Can I...

43:51.588 --> 43:53.382
--Can I tell you why?

43:55.592 --> 43:57.511
Because I have this...

43:59.054 --> 44:01.807
incredible ability to bring...

44:01.890 --> 44:05.852
disaster to the best things in my life
and tonight has been perfect.

44:07.313 --> 44:09.523
--Don't you think?

44:11.608 --> 44:12.776
Yes.

44:14.861 --> 44:18.699
And if I stop now, then I get to keep
this one perfect night.

44:20.951 --> 44:24.663
And also have the chance
of keeping it going tomorrow.

44:30.252 --> 44:31.795
And the day after...

44:38.635 --> 44:41.054
And the day after that...

44:41.137 --> 44:43.056
- And the...

44:44.099 --> 44:45.267
Exactly.

44:55.110 --> 44:58.196
Then I guess it's good night...

44:58.280 --> 45:00.115
- Mr. Murdock.

45:03.034 --> 45:04.536
Good night, Ms. Page.

45:47.704 --> 45:49.498
Fix me up, man?
Fix me up.

45:51.667 --> 45:54.210
I know who you are, man!
I know who you are!

45:58.757 --> 46:01.302
How much you got, man?
How much you got?

46:08.309 --> 46:10.561
Oh, Jesus Christ.

46:10.644 --> 46:13.772
When I get out of this...

46:15.982 --> 46:18.610
- Oh, I'll remember your faces.

46:18.694 --> 46:20.612
Every single bit of them...

46:21.822 --> 46:24.700
- I will hunt you!
- Aw...

46:24.783 --> 46:26.368
When you get out?

46:26.452 --> 46:28.412
--Where did you find him?

46:28.912 --> 46:31.540
Monte Carlo.
I wasn't lying.

46:32.666 --> 46:35.877
He's been going by an alias for years now.

46:35.961 --> 46:38.505
Al Marino.

46:38.589 --> 46:41.758
An ugly name for an ugly man.

46:41.842 --> 46:43.594
Oh, you're dead.

46:43.677 --> 46:45.554
Both of ya!

46:45.637 --> 46:47.848
Couple of kids playing house!

46:47.931 --> 46:49.433
Hey!

46:49.516 --> 46:51.059
Watch your tongue.

46:51.142 --> 46:52.268
While it's still attached.

46:53.812 --> 46:56.607
He tried to hide.
Went underground.

46:56.690 --> 46:59.443
But the scum always rises.

46:59.526 --> 47:02.363
Al just couldn't stay anonymous.

47:02.446 --> 47:04.365
He had to spend his blood money.

47:04.448 --> 47:06.282
Make a splash.

47:06.367 --> 47:07.868
Be the big man.

47:07.951 --> 47:09.620
You made it easy for me.

47:09.703 --> 47:11.079
Eat shit.

47:12.373 --> 47:14.040
Want me to hit you again?

47:15.709 --> 47:17.210
Well, I won't.

47:17.293 --> 47:18.670
But he will.

47:29.390 --> 47:33.018
I don't know him from Christ,
but one look and I can tell.

47:34.352 --> 47:36.938
Pretty boy ain't got it in him.

47:37.022 --> 47:39.315
You don't remember me?

47:42.152 --> 47:44.154
You killed my father.

47:44.237 --> 47:46.364
Well, I hate to break it to you, son...

47:46.448 --> 47:49.451
but I killed a lot of guys' dads.

47:49.535 --> 47:50.994
Then let me help you.

47:52.287 --> 47:53.705
He hit hard.

47:55.165 --> 47:56.207
Like this.

48:16.311 --> 48:17.771
You call that hard?

48:17.854 --> 48:20.065
Let it out.

48:20.148 --> 48:21.191
Let it out.

48:21.274 --> 48:23.902
Okay? Whatever's inside you.

48:23.985 --> 48:25.862
Do it for your father, Matthew.

48:25.946 --> 48:27.448
Do it for us.

48:27.531 --> 48:29.115
Come on.

48:29.199 --> 48:30.826
"Matthew"?

48:32.494 --> 48:35.581
You're Battlin' Jack's boy!

48:35.664 --> 48:37.916
Oh, you amateur.

48:38.667 --> 48:40.627
Now I know your name.

48:41.628 --> 48:46.842
Nothing'll stop me from bloodying
the street with your corpse.

48:46.925 --> 48:49.928
Just like I did to your old man!

48:53.599 --> 48:55.058
Yes.

49:09.573 --> 49:11.366
End it.

49:11.449 --> 49:12.701
End it now.

49:12.784 --> 49:14.410
-What?
-Keep going.

49:16.079 --> 49:17.664
No, that's, uh...

49:19.332 --> 49:22.127
- No, that's all I got.
- No...

49:22.210 --> 49:23.837
He knows your name.

49:24.838 --> 49:26.381
Cut his throat.

49:26.464 --> 49:27.674
Kill him.

49:27.758 --> 49:28.925
What?

49:30.093 --> 49:31.136
Kill him.

49:38.143 --> 49:40.812
I can't do that.

49:42.105 --> 49:45.275
We can do anything together.

49:45.358 --> 49:46.860
Remember?

49:58.038 --> 49:59.330
No, I can't.

50:06.296 --> 50:08.506
I thought you understood me.

50:09.465 --> 50:11.217
Yeah, I thought I did, too.

50:14.220 --> 50:15.430
We need to call the police.

50:26.149 --> 50:29.069
- 911, what is your emergency?
- Um...

50:29.695 --> 50:32.864
Yes, I'd like to report
the location of a wanted felon.

50:34.991 --> 50:36.702
The name is Roscoe Sweeney.

50:36.785 --> 50:38.453
What is the address?

51:08.066 --> 51:10.568
See? You missed me, too.

51:17.325 --> 51:19.202
Did you have a nice dinner?

51:25.709 --> 51:28.544
Elektra, I came here
to ask you a question,

51:28.629 --> 51:30.797
and I'd like for you to answer it.

51:38.639 --> 51:40.682
Why did you take me to that mansion?

51:43.101 --> 51:44.602
That's your question?

51:46.271 --> 51:47.522
For fun.

51:49.315 --> 51:50.525
For fun?

51:52.568 --> 51:53.945
That's fun for you?

51:55.613 --> 51:57.532
To try to push me into killing a man?

51:57.615 --> 51:58.742
Oh...

52:00.952 --> 52:03.496
I didn't push you into anything.

52:04.998 --> 52:06.750
And you didn't kill anyone.

52:08.001 --> 52:09.670
-But you wanted to.
-No, I didn't.

52:09.753 --> 52:12.130
Don't do that, don't...
Not now, don't...

52:12.213 --> 52:14.299
You act like you have some
window into my soul,

52:14.382 --> 52:16.677
but you don't,
and you never have.

52:19.304 --> 52:23.058
There was always this glorious
darkness inside you.

52:23.141 --> 52:24.225
No.

52:24.309 --> 52:26.978
That's why I took you to Roscoe Sweeney's.

52:30.273 --> 52:31.524
And, yes.

52:32.901 --> 52:34.360
That's why I loved you.

52:37.948 --> 52:39.866
That's why you loved me, too.

52:41.827 --> 52:43.704
Don't deny what we have.

52:46.164 --> 52:47.290
Please.

52:48.875 --> 52:50.919
You think that's what love is?

52:55.131 --> 52:56.549
Someone... someone's coming.

52:58.384 --> 53:00.053
- Mmm-hmm.

53:00.136 --> 53:02.180
--The elevator's moving--

53:02.263 --> 53:03.473
--There's...

53:03.556 --> 53:05.516
There's a silencer in the lobby.

53:06.601 --> 53:07.894
Who is it, Elektra?

53:07.978 --> 53:09.813
If I had to guess, Yakuza.

53:11.689 --> 53:12.690
No.

53:12.774 --> 53:15.235
No, that's impossible.
I took care of the Yakuza.

53:15.318 --> 53:17.988
Clearly, you didn't.
Hold my gloves?

53:19.447 --> 53:23.284
Today, at the Yakatomi Building,
I infiltrated Asano,

53:23.368 --> 53:26.079
the Japanese branch of Roxxon,

53:26.162 --> 53:28.373
and I planted a little bug
to crash their system.

53:28.456 --> 53:30.541
Yeah, I heard it.

53:30.625 --> 53:32.836
You knew they'd come for you?

53:32.919 --> 53:34.629
Well, I knew they'd come here.

53:35.588 --> 53:37.883
This building isn't in my name.
I'm no amateur.

53:37.966 --> 53:40.010
Hold on a second,
did you know I'd come?

53:40.927 --> 53:42.512
My confidence was high.

53:45.431 --> 53:46.432
You planned this.

53:46.516 --> 53:48.059
Everything you said in the apartment,
it's just lies.

53:48.143 --> 53:49.602
You don't mean it,
you're not sorry...

53:49.685 --> 53:50.686
It's just manipulation with you.

53:50.771 --> 53:51.813
-It's the same thing--
-No!

53:51.897 --> 53:53.189
Over and over again,
you just manipulate!

53:53.273 --> 53:54.274
Matthew!

53:54.357 --> 53:56.484
-I told you, I know you.
-You don't.

53:56.567 --> 53:57.986
I've always known you.

53:58.069 --> 54:00.280
-Then, and now.
-No, you don't know me.

54:00.363 --> 54:02.240
So, now, you tell me.

54:02.323 --> 54:05.535
-You can handle them yourself.
-Do I need to push you this time?
