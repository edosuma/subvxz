00:06.740 --> 00:08.542
BOB LEE:
Previously on "Shooter"...

00:08.576 --> 00:10.111
I'm writing a book
about your husband.

00:10.144 --> 00:12.146
I don't think he did it.
I can help.

00:12.180 --> 00:14.382
Ukrainian journalist
by the name of Karlina Ordenko

00:14.415 --> 00:15.383
has gone missing.

00:15.416 --> 00:17.118
I need to talk to her.

00:17.151 --> 00:19.320
The micro-drive,
so-called Annex B files.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.189
I-I can't understand you.
Oh, my God, they found me.

00:21.222 --> 00:22.356
They found--

00:22.390 --> 00:24.158
[screams]
Karlina?

00:24.192 --> 00:25.526
Karlina Ordenko is dead.

00:25.559 --> 00:27.395
I believe a man
named Grigory Krukov

00:27.428 --> 00:28.562
gave the order
to have her killed.

00:28.596 --> 00:30.364
He's a high-ranking
member of the FSB.

00:30.398 --> 00:32.133
[gunshot]

00:32.166 --> 00:33.134
O'BRIEN: You find the other
Black Kings,

00:33.167 --> 00:34.435
you find your shooter.

00:34.468 --> 00:35.436
[gunshot]

00:35.469 --> 00:37.271
1,500 yards.

00:37.305 --> 00:39.273
What's that guy's name?
HELLING: Lon Scott.

00:39.307 --> 00:43.144
NADINE: CEO of Anhur Dynamics?
The resolution is shitty.

00:43.177 --> 00:44.512
It's a cell phone video.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.480
My laptop original,
it's way better.

00:46.514 --> 00:48.849
It's like every page
of the complete,

00:48.882 --> 00:51.285
un-redacted copy
of the Annex B file,

00:51.319 --> 00:54.088
which I also have
in my possession.

00:54.122 --> 00:55.556
I need you to suspend me.
Suspend you?

00:55.589 --> 00:56.857
What the hell
are you talking about?

00:56.890 --> 00:58.326
I need you
to trust me on this.

00:58.359 --> 00:59.627
He found the shooter.

00:59.660 --> 01:01.295
Lon Scott,
that's him, right?

01:01.329 --> 01:02.596
What the hell
are you talking about?

01:02.630 --> 01:04.365
No way he'd expose himself.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.167
He exposed himself,
all right.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.402
Bob Lee is headed to Virginia.

01:08.436 --> 01:10.271
I'm guessing he's
planning a rendezvous.

01:12.306 --> 01:15.276
[soft suspenseful music]

01:15.309 --> 01:22.316

01:39.500 --> 01:41.202
BOB LEE: Memphis.

01:41.235 --> 01:43.271
Swagger?

01:43.304 --> 01:45.306
Hey, thanks for coming.

02:00.254 --> 02:02.156
[phone beeps]

02:02.190 --> 02:03.657
WOMAN: [speaking Russian]

02:03.691 --> 02:06.694
[speaking Russian]

02:12.433 --> 02:14.568
WOMAN: [speaking Russian]

02:14.602 --> 02:15.636
All right.
All right.

02:15.669 --> 02:17.438
Would you just shut up?

02:17.471 --> 02:19.540
Just tell him
I have the thumb drive.

02:19.573 --> 02:22.743
Annex B.
My number's not blocked.

02:22.776 --> 02:24.578
He has three minutes
to call me back.

02:24.612 --> 02:25.579
WOMAN: [speaking Russian]

02:25.613 --> 02:26.580
[phone claps]

02:26.614 --> 02:33.621
*

02:37.425 --> 02:40.428
[phone vibrating]

02:45.466 --> 02:47.735
Yo.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.670
KRUKOV: What do you want, Jack?

02:49.703 --> 02:52.706
What, you don't want to talk
about the high price of caviar?

02:52.740 --> 02:55.576
KRUKOV: Nyet.
Okay, fine.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.311
I want $10 million

02:57.345 --> 03:02.516
in uncut diamonds
for Dimitri's thumb drive.

03:02.550 --> 03:04.485
Hello?

03:04.518 --> 03:06.687
You know, I can always go
to "The Washington Post."

03:06.720 --> 03:09.423
KRUKOV: [chuckles]

03:09.457 --> 03:10.991
Right.

03:11.024 --> 03:13.227
Uh, look, I don't care
where you get 'em.

03:13.261 --> 03:16.264
Get 'em from Panama.
Get 'em from Putin.

03:16.297 --> 03:17.665
[laughs]
I don't really give a shit.

03:17.698 --> 03:20.434
KRUKOV:
It is a complicated request.

03:20.468 --> 03:22.570
There are layers.

03:22.603 --> 03:25.406
A cake has layers, Grig.
Okay?

03:25.439 --> 03:29.577
Just--I'll turn my phone
on tomorrow at 12:00.

03:29.610 --> 03:33.614
You have till 12:03
to call me back with a deal.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.753
NADINE:
So what do you got so far?

03:39.787 --> 03:43.491
BOB LEE: He's got three guard
rotations, six in each unit.

03:43.524 --> 03:45.359
They rotate at 6:00 a.m.,
2:00 p.m.,

03:45.393 --> 03:46.527
and 10:00 p.m.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.761
Nobody visits.

03:47.795 --> 03:48.796
He never goes anywhere.

03:48.829 --> 03:51.299
Look, we need to talk.

03:51.332 --> 03:53.801
Then talk.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.769
There's a thumb drive.

03:55.803 --> 03:57.371
It contains proof,

03:57.405 --> 03:58.872
definitive proof
of what happens in the Ukraine

03:58.906 --> 04:01.609
and why their president
was assassinated.

04:01.642 --> 04:04.512
They killed Karlina Ordenko
trying to find it.

04:04.545 --> 04:07.548
It'll clear your name.

04:09.850 --> 04:12.453
You heard what I said, right?

04:12.486 --> 04:14.822
Yes.
You need to find the proof.

04:14.855 --> 04:16.524
But if we can't...

04:16.557 --> 04:17.825
[scoffs]

04:17.858 --> 04:21.695
Lon Scott is sitting on
the sequel to Iran-Contra.

04:21.729 --> 04:24.598
Whatever happens,
we're going to get him.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.567
Don't be so sure.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.503
The bigger the conspiracy,
the bigger the people involved.

04:29.537 --> 04:31.805
Then we'll expose them all,

04:31.839 --> 04:34.542
all the way to the top,
as high as it goes.

04:36.844 --> 04:39.547
Okay, Agent Memphis.
We'll do it your way.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.782
But if it doesn't work,
it's back to plan A.

04:41.815 --> 04:44.452
NADINE: What's plan A?

04:44.485 --> 04:46.387
What do you think?

04:46.420 --> 04:49.390
[dramatic music]

04:49.423 --> 04:55.829
*

04:58.966 --> 05:01.969
[phone vibrating]

05:02.002 --> 05:03.571
Yeah?

05:03.604 --> 05:04.972
HOWARD: Spoke to my buddy
at the FAA.

05:05.005 --> 05:07.941
An Anhur private jet
took off from Bellingham

05:07.975 --> 05:10.010
60 minutes after Payne
was walked out of here.

05:10.043 --> 05:11.945
The flight plan had them
going to Delaware,

05:11.979 --> 05:13.013
but they left
controlled airspace

05:13.046 --> 05:14.915
when they got to Virginia.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.950
Baby, you just got to hang
in a couple more days.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.952
Heard that before.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.521
BOB LEE: You can believe me.
We're in field-goal range.

05:20.554 --> 05:22.089
I promise it's almost over.

05:22.122 --> 05:23.457
JULIE: Okay.

05:23.491 --> 05:25.659
Hey, you remember
the old Ranger station?

05:25.693 --> 05:27.628
Damn right I do.
Okay, settle down.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.430
[chuckles]

05:29.463 --> 05:30.564
BOBBY LEE: I need you
and Mary to get there

05:30.598 --> 05:32.466
as soon as you can.

05:32.500 --> 05:35.636
Are we in trouble?
Can you slip away quietly?

05:35.669 --> 05:37.505
JULIE: Yes, definitely.

05:37.538 --> 05:40.140
I'll check in as soon
as I'm clear of this.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.876
Is this really almost over?

05:42.910 --> 05:45.413
The hard part will be,

05:45.446 --> 05:48.449
and you're not gonna have to
look over your shoulder anymore.

05:48.482 --> 05:50.918
The rest of it
we'll deal with later.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.922
All right, babe.
I got to go.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.957
I love you.

06:04.632 --> 06:07.167
NADINE: Okay, Anhur
has a private airfield

06:07.200 --> 06:08.469
in Langley Falls.

06:08.502 --> 06:09.637
It's about 20 minutes from here.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.539
HOWARD:
I know, I ran it.

06:11.572 --> 06:12.740
They were just issued
a diplomatic clearance number

06:12.773 --> 06:15.175
for a flight
originating in Russia.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.978
It's scheduled to arrive
in half an hour.

06:18.011 --> 06:19.447
Lon Scott's on the move.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.449
I know where he's going.

06:21.482 --> 06:24.452
[dramatic music]

06:24.485 --> 06:31.492
*

06:38.165 --> 06:40.167
So according to my boss
at the Bureau,

06:40.200 --> 06:43.003
an Anhur private jet took off
from Bellingham an hour

06:43.036 --> 06:46.540
after Payne got sprung
from the Seattle office.

06:51.211 --> 06:53.581
BOB LEE: Well, Payne's
on Lon Scott's payroll,

06:53.614 --> 06:55.516
so that makes sense.

06:55.549 --> 06:59.720
*

06:59.753 --> 07:01.755
NADINE: And based on
his intel at the FAA,

07:01.789 --> 07:04.124
this airfield was just issued
a diplomatic clearance

07:04.157 --> 07:07.461
on a flight
originating from Russia.

07:09.997 --> 07:12.666
BOB LEE: All right.
Let's see who we get.

07:12.700 --> 07:19.172
*

07:19.206 --> 07:21.542
That's Meachum and...

07:21.575 --> 07:26.547
*

07:26.580 --> 07:27.748
That's Grigory Krukov,

07:27.781 --> 07:31.084
the FSB officer
I mentioned earlier.

07:31.118 --> 07:35.022
Full security detail.
He's not taking any chances.

07:35.055 --> 07:37.190
[car approaches]

07:40.761 --> 07:41.729
Where are you going?

07:41.762 --> 07:44.565
I'm moving ringside.

07:44.598 --> 07:51.605
*

08:12.159 --> 08:13.794
KRUKOV: Where is Payne?

08:13.827 --> 08:17.765
MEACHUM: Shit, did we forget
to send him an eVite?

08:17.798 --> 08:22.069
KRUKOV: He wants $10 million
for the thumb drive.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.204
You screwed up.
You pay him.

08:24.237 --> 08:26.740
I was tasked with killing
the Ukrainian president.

08:26.774 --> 08:29.577
Last time I checked, his brains
were all over the sidewalk.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.144
And things have just been
as smooth

08:31.178 --> 08:33.581
as a minx's kiska
ever since.

08:33.614 --> 08:35.215
Payne knows how to hide.

08:35.248 --> 08:37.284
It could take a while
to find him.

08:37.317 --> 08:40.187
I didn't fly 5,000 miles
to be told this.

08:40.220 --> 08:44.758
I know the problem.
What is your solution?

08:44.792 --> 08:46.226
Pay him.

08:46.259 --> 08:47.828
Nyet.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.598
Grigory, he's got Annex B.

08:50.631 --> 08:52.633
Once that gets out,
there'll be an investigation,

08:52.666 --> 08:54.568
followed by sanctions.

08:54.602 --> 08:56.737
Finally, NATO tanks
on your border.

08:56.770 --> 08:59.106
What the hell
are we talking about?

08:59.139 --> 09:01.141
Pay him.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.281
You could be
implicated too, Lon.

09:08.315 --> 09:12.185
Anhur is all over
that thumb drive.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.787
I'm not worried about that.

09:13.821 --> 09:15.589
If anything, it'll just enhance
our reputation.

09:15.623 --> 09:16.724
[scoffs]

09:16.757 --> 09:19.226
Plus, it's a big world.

09:19.259 --> 09:20.327
I got a lot of money.

09:20.360 --> 09:23.664
MEACHUM: [chuckles]

09:23.697 --> 09:24.932
Payne has the Annex B file.

09:24.965 --> 09:27.267
He's using it
to finance an exit.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.202
I'll deal with the Russians.
I'll turn up the heat.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.337
Red on red.

09:30.370 --> 09:32.305
Red on red?

09:32.339 --> 09:33.874
Yeah, we'll play them
against each other.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.242
That's what we did
in Afghanistan.

09:35.275 --> 09:36.910
How does that get us
what we need?

09:36.944 --> 09:38.779
We just make sure Payne
comes out the other side of it.

09:38.812 --> 09:41.782
And let him lead us
right to it.

09:41.815 --> 09:44.818
[indistinct chatter]

09:51.258 --> 09:54.728
You're not hard to find.

09:54.762 --> 09:56.196
Who said I was hiding?

09:56.229 --> 09:58.732
How the hell
can you eat that?

09:58.766 --> 10:00.668
It tastes good.
What do you want?

10:00.701 --> 10:02.269
Bob Lee's here.

10:02.302 --> 10:05.272
You might want to stay away
from open spaces, windows.

10:06.707 --> 10:09.309
I already know he's here.

10:11.311 --> 10:13.847
You talked to him.

10:13.881 --> 10:15.182
Holy shit.

10:15.215 --> 10:17.417
You did.
Let me guess.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.386
He said no.

10:19.419 --> 10:22.289
You're reaching.
Wasn't a very smart play.

10:22.322 --> 10:24.324
Not like you at all.

10:29.229 --> 10:30.397
I need a path out.

10:30.430 --> 10:32.299
Nobody's stopping you.

10:32.332 --> 10:34.267
There's the door.
Thanks for playing.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.169
Retirement costs money.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.441
All right.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.911
You want out?

10:43.944 --> 10:47.414
There's one last thing
you could do for me.

10:47.447 --> 10:50.217
Payne's got Annex B.
He wants $10 million.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.985
Lon said no.

10:52.019 --> 10:54.187
He tried the Russians?
They won't pay either.

10:54.221 --> 10:59.292
Find Payne.
Get the thumb drive.

10:59.326 --> 11:03.764
I'll fund your IRA.

11:03.797 --> 11:06.399
Get me Payne's files
from Anhur.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.368
Ops, personnel, financials.

11:08.401 --> 11:10.237
There's got to be a place
he stays, eats,

11:10.270 --> 11:13.006
and gets a blow job
on a regular basis.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.474
I already did that.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.877
Yeah?
You miss things.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.912
Oh.

12:41.061 --> 12:43.296
Don't feel bad.

12:43.330 --> 12:45.332
You couldn't know
he was already in the room.

12:50.003 --> 12:53.841
Special Agent Memphis
from Seattle FBI office,

12:53.874 --> 12:56.076
Russian Organized
Crime Unit, yes?

12:56.109 --> 13:00.380
*

13:00.413 --> 13:04.151
If you kill me, she dies.

13:04.184 --> 13:07.154
So you may as well
drop it, Swagger.

13:07.187 --> 13:13.927
*

13:13.961 --> 13:16.063
I know Jack Payne's
blackmailing you.

13:16.096 --> 13:17.397
Tell him you'll pay him off,

13:17.430 --> 13:18.398
and when he comes out
of hiding to collect,

13:18.431 --> 13:20.834
I'll kill him for you.

13:20.868 --> 13:21.869
While I'm at it,
I'll kill Meachum

13:21.902 --> 13:25.072
and Lon Scott for you too.

13:25.105 --> 13:27.474
You are trying to entrap me.

13:27.507 --> 13:29.977
She's wearing wire.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.044
Show him.

13:31.078 --> 13:38.085
*

13:42.255 --> 13:45.358
I'm not with the FBI.
I've been suspended.

13:45.392 --> 13:47.394
And yet you still have gun.

13:47.427 --> 13:48.461
This is America.

13:48.495 --> 13:51.865
[chuckles]

13:51.899 --> 13:54.034
And now,
you two are a team.

13:54.067 --> 13:56.870
Yes.
So we're all friends here.

13:56.904 --> 13:58.338
Yes, we are.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.974
*

14:01.008 --> 14:04.011
I survived the fall
of communism

14:04.044 --> 14:06.279
and three presidents.

14:06.313 --> 14:09.482
You know how?

14:09.516 --> 14:12.185
Never trusting anyone.

14:12.219 --> 14:17.124
*

14:17.157 --> 14:19.492
Call your boss.

14:19.526 --> 14:24.031
Ask for State Department file
on me, Grigory Krukov.

14:24.064 --> 14:27.267
He says no, I believe you.

14:27.300 --> 14:30.537
If he provides it, well...

14:30.570 --> 14:34.407

14:39.379 --> 14:42.049
NADINE:
This is Special Agent Memphis.

14:42.082 --> 14:44.017
I need the State Department file

14:44.051 --> 14:47.520
on a Russian diplomat,
Grigory Krukov.

14:47.554 --> 14:51.424
*

14:51.458 --> 14:53.393
HOWARD: What's going on?
Nothing.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.095
Just need the file, sir.

14:55.128 --> 15:00.968
*

15:01.001 --> 15:03.971
Memphis, you were suspended.

15:04.004 --> 15:06.573
As you know, your access
to FBI files is revoked.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.441
Don't call here again.

15:08.475 --> 15:15.482
*

15:24.091 --> 15:28.328
Lon Scott, Meachum, and Payne,
are you not forgetting someone?

15:30.130 --> 15:31.498
Me.

15:31.531 --> 15:34.467
I'd like to kill you.

15:34.501 --> 15:37.270
But if I do,
more Russians keep coming.

15:37.304 --> 15:40.974
If I kill them,
it's tied off on their side.

15:41.008 --> 15:42.209
But...

15:42.242 --> 15:45.178
I want what you're
giving Payne.

15:45.212 --> 15:48.481
What makes you think
I want him dead that badly?

15:48.515 --> 15:50.517
'Cause they're amateurs,

15:50.550 --> 15:52.385
and you're thinking about it,

15:52.419 --> 15:56.123
which means you still get paid
even with them dead.

15:56.156 --> 15:59.226
I didn't think you were
a man that cared about money.

15:59.259 --> 16:00.493
I don't.

16:00.527 --> 16:01.561
But after the shit
I've been through,

16:01.594 --> 16:04.297
I think I deserve some privacy.

16:04.331 --> 16:05.598
I'm thinking a ranch,

16:05.632 --> 16:08.101
a couple thousand acres,
big fence.

16:08.135 --> 16:10.003
Keep my family safe.

16:10.037 --> 16:13.240
[tense music]

16:13.273 --> 16:20.247
*

16:20.280 --> 16:22.249
Okay, Swagger.

16:22.282 --> 16:25.118
You can have the $10 million.

16:25.152 --> 16:27.120
*

16:27.154 --> 16:30.157
You kill Meachum,
Lon Scott,

16:30.190 --> 16:33.526
and Payne,
and I get Annex B.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.662
Done.

16:35.695 --> 16:37.330
The meet has to be
at the airport.

16:37.364 --> 16:39.132
It's the perfect place
for me to shoot.

16:39.166 --> 16:40.267
They will be suspicious.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.568
Then throw in a getaway plane.

16:41.601 --> 16:44.337
*

16:44.371 --> 16:47.174
When heads start popping,
you go.

16:47.207 --> 16:48.508
But if you don't leave me
the money, you're dead

16:48.541 --> 16:50.310
before your foot hits
the step of your jet.

16:50.343 --> 16:57.317
*

16:57.350 --> 16:59.052
You okay?

16:59.086 --> 17:00.087
Yeah.

17:02.222 --> 17:03.356
Thanks for doing that, bro.

17:03.390 --> 17:05.458
Any time, my bro,
any time.

17:05.492 --> 17:07.194

Long time, no see.

17:25.412 --> 17:26.446
You're not armed?

17:26.479 --> 17:28.648
It's casual Friday.

17:28.681 --> 17:32.252
So, what, you tracked me down
through my Leavenworth cellmate?

17:32.285 --> 17:33.253
I'm impressed.

17:33.286 --> 17:35.255
The thumb drive,
where is it?

17:35.288 --> 17:37.524
You kill me,
you'll never find out.

17:44.264 --> 17:45.665
Next time, it won't
just be a muzzle burn.

17:45.698 --> 17:47.500
What, kneecaps?

17:47.534 --> 17:49.202
Nuts?

17:49.236 --> 17:51.671
Word of advice,
if I bleed out and die,

17:51.704 --> 17:54.207
the Russians are
gonna be pissed.

17:54.241 --> 17:55.542
I don't give a shit
about the Russians.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.344
Where's the thumb drive?
Right.

You're still
Meachum's errand boy.

Well, he can't have it,

18:01.614 --> 18:03.616
and neither can you.

18:03.650 --> 18:06.686
I die, it flies,
and you know I'm right.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.288
Bullshit.

18:08.321 --> 18:10.490
Look, the Russians
just agreed to pay me, okay?

18:10.523 --> 18:15.362
You blow it now, they will be on
your ass until the end of time.

18:15.395 --> 18:17.130
So kill me

a tin can from 100 yards?

18:58.638 --> 19:00.473
The thing's five feet tall.

Guard shift's about to change,
so it's time to go to work.

19:45.852 --> 19:49.356
I swapped out the substation
fuses with cheaper ones.

19:49.389 --> 19:51.458
They'll short out soon.

19:51.491 --> 19:52.825
The lights will dip
when the generator kicks on,

19:52.859 --> 19:56.496
and that's when you tuck in.

19:56.529 --> 20:00.267
Wait until you see flames,
and then count to five.

20:00.300 --> 20:03.270
Propane ignites at 470 degrees,

How do you know this shit?

20:05.372 --> 20:07.474
I'm a sniper.

Remember, this silencer
gives you one shot,

hear you down below.

I can assure you,
I'm unarmed.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.896
The only way I want to kill you
is the only way I imagine

22:09.929 --> 22:11.831
you'd like to kill me.

22:11.864 --> 22:15.101
On a long gun.

There's a meeting.

Krukov called for it
to pay off Payne.

22:19.606 --> 22:21.974
Yeah, I'm not going.
I think it's a set-up.

You're right.
It is a set-up.

22:27.079 --> 22:28.848
You can have the $10 million.

You kill Meachum, Lon Scott,
and Payne.

22:32.885 --> 22:35.488
*

22:35.522 --> 22:37.790
So why am I still alive?

22:37.824 --> 22:39.726
I could've taken you out
two days ago at the hangar

22:39.759 --> 22:42.529
when your guards
left you exposed.

22:42.562 --> 22:44.997
They didn't cover you on your
morning run around the grounds.

22:45.031 --> 22:46.666
Hmm.

22:46.699 --> 22:49.569
If I thought you matter,
you'd already be dead.

22:49.602 --> 22:52.104
But you're just a cog
in the Russians' wheel.

22:52.138 --> 22:54.507
It's them I want.

22:54.541 --> 22:56.976
So why didn't you kill them
when you had the chance?

22:57.009 --> 22:58.611
I was outgunned.

22:58.645 --> 23:00.713
Yeah?

23:00.747 --> 23:02.782
Should've done
your reconnaissance.

23:02.815 --> 23:04.684
I did my reconnaissance
on you.

23:04.717 --> 23:08.621
You were the Oregon Junior Rifle
Champion three years in a row.

23:08.655 --> 23:10.089
You were making shots
most shooters

23:10.122 --> 23:12.759
in the adult
competition couldn't make.

23:12.792 --> 23:17.797
But then, at 18, you lost.

23:17.830 --> 23:20.900
You didn't even crack
the final round.

23:20.933 --> 23:22.769
I assume the death
of your father earlier

23:22.802 --> 23:25.805
that year had
an adverse effect on you.

23:28.875 --> 23:31.778
Fathers have a way of
screwing up their sons.

23:31.811 --> 23:34.647
Hmm.
They sure do.

23:34.681 --> 23:37.617

23:37.650 --> 23:40.787
I don't remember the pain.

How about you?

23:44.123 --> 23:47.960
Yeah,
I remember it.

23:47.994 --> 23:50.029
You know, my accident
happened before I got a chance

23:50.062 --> 23:52.064
to serve my country.

23:52.098 --> 23:54.801
I serve it now, though.

23:54.834 --> 23:56.135
For years, I wanted to be
as good as you.

23:56.168 --> 23:59.572
But we both know
I'm better now.

23:59.606 --> 24:03.876
*

24:03.910 --> 24:05.612
Yeah, the shot that
killed the Ukrainian president

24:05.645 --> 24:07.814
was a good one,

24:07.847 --> 24:10.049
even with your special
red bullet.

24:40.112 --> 24:41.814
There you go.
I got your bag.

24:41.848 --> 24:43.783
I'll see you in a second.

24:43.816 --> 24:45.785
Take it.
It's not much.

24:45.818 --> 24:47.820
I can't.

What are you gonna do
if things don't pan out

24:55.895 --> 24:58.030
the way Bob Lee says?

24:58.064 --> 25:00.700
Please, I swore
I'd take care of you.

25:00.733 --> 25:03.202
You already have.

25:03.235 --> 25:05.237
Where are you going?

25:09.141 --> 25:12.812
You can't say, can you?

25:12.845 --> 25:15.014
You can't say when you'll call
or when I'll see you again.

25:15.047 --> 25:16.248
Hey, I'll reach out
to you when we're safe.

25:16.282 --> 25:20.119
I promise.

25:20.152 --> 25:21.821
You remember when
I used to sneak out

25:21.854 --> 25:23.756
to Tommy O'Leary's house?

25:23.790 --> 25:25.992
And what has that got
to do with anything?

25:26.025 --> 25:28.227
You've always covered
for me my whole life,

25:28.260 --> 25:30.697
no matter what.

25:30.730 --> 25:34.701
I need you to do it
this one last time.

anyone, no one.

Bye, Auntie Anne.

25:43.810 --> 25:46.879
Oh, good-bye, sweetheart.

25:46.913 --> 25:49.215
You be a good girl, and you
take care of your mommy for me.

25:49.248 --> 25:50.216
Okay?

25:50.249 --> 25:51.918
Mm-hmm.
Come on.

Okay.

26:05.031 --> 26:06.699

26:06.733 --> 26:09.068
Goddamn, Payne.
Nothing you need to worry about.

26:09.101 --> 26:10.737
Just do what you can
to shut Payne up.

26:13.039 --> 26:14.741
Who was that?

26:14.774 --> 26:16.242
Like I don't have
enough problems.

26:16.275 --> 26:18.077
Now, I hear you've
changed your mind.

26:18.110 --> 26:20.279
LON SCOTT:
They hired Swagger to kill us.

26:20.312 --> 26:22.815
Now he's gonna
kill them instead.

26:22.849 --> 26:25.117
MEACHUM: You arranged this
with Swagger.

26:25.151 --> 26:26.719
What makes you think he isn't
gonna pop you too

26:26.753 --> 26:27.787
while he's at it?

26:27.820 --> 26:30.222
He will.
He'll try.

26:30.256 --> 26:33.125
But it's worth the risk
in order to get my shot at him.

26:35.862 --> 26:39.331
He kills the Russians,
he kills the deal.

26:39.365 --> 26:40.967
You'll be able to make
a new deal

Krukov's replacement is.

27:02.321 --> 27:03.856
Simon Porter.
She knows me.

27:03.890 --> 27:05.291
I just said
she's busy right now.

27:05.324 --> 27:07.259
It's very important
that I speak to her.

27:07.293 --> 27:09.395
You've got one second to get
your foot out of my door

27:48.868 --> 27:49.936
I'll have someone there
within the hour.

27:49.969 --> 27:51.904

All right,

28:08.955 --> 28:12.925
Okay, so everyone arrives.
Then what?

28:12.959 --> 28:14.426
Then I'm gonna
light the fuse.

28:14.460 --> 28:16.228
Speak English.

BOBBY LEE: Create chaos and get
them questioning each other.

28:18.931 --> 28:21.467
Red on red.

28:21.500 --> 28:24.303
There'll be no innocents
in that hangar today.

28:24.336 --> 28:25.772
Like I told you,
if all goes well,

28:25.805 --> 28:27.339
all you'll have to do is spot.

28:27.373 --> 28:29.976
But if some shit goes wrong,

28:30.009 --> 28:32.278
you keep Payne alive
until we get the evidence.

This is some Deep Throat shit.

29:00.973 --> 29:03.810
The situation
has grown untenable.

29:03.843 --> 29:05.011
No kidding.

29:05.044 --> 29:07.413
Swagger approached me
with a deal.

29:07.446 --> 29:10.282
Let me guess.
He gets to kill everyone.

29:10.316 --> 29:11.951
In exchange,
you leave him alone.

29:11.984 --> 29:15.387
He wants his life back.

29:15.421 --> 29:17.790
After Swagger has killed
Lon Scott, Meachum,

29:17.824 --> 29:22.394
and Payne,
I'd like you to kill him.

29:22.428 --> 29:24.296
Why the hell would
I trust you?

29:24.330 --> 29:27.399
Because our interests
are aligned.

29:29.836 --> 29:32.004
All right.

29:32.038 --> 29:34.306
After it's done
and Bob Lee is dead,

29:34.340 --> 29:37.810
you get on a plane
with Annex B, and you go.

29:37.844 --> 29:40.546
But you leave the diamonds.

29:40.579 --> 29:42.581
Of course.

29:42.614 --> 29:45.384
How will you do it?

29:45.417 --> 29:46.986
That's not your problem.

Good morning, Ms. Murphy.

SIMON: Anne, we have
a formal offer of $500,000

29:59.065 --> 30:02.001
for exclusive rights
to Julie and Bob Lee's story.

30:02.034 --> 30:03.535
I know Julie's gone.

30:03.569 --> 30:05.537
Can we please come in
and talk it over?

30:05.571 --> 30:08.474
I know she needs the money.

30:10.409 --> 30:11.477
You have a beautiful home.

Let's just get this over with.

We are delighted
to present this offer to you.

30:20.052 --> 30:21.620
Take your time.
Read it carefully.

30:21.653 --> 30:23.923
It's a very generous offer.

30:23.956 --> 30:26.458
If my sister said no, she
probably won't change her mind.

30:26.492 --> 30:31.397
Well, if it's in her best
interest, maybe she should.

30:31.430 --> 30:34.033
How soon do you think
you can get this to her?

30:34.066 --> 30:35.467
ANNE: I don't know.
She's very busy.

this is appropriate.
