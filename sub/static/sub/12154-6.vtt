01:15.536 --> 01:17.286
- Mr. Eaton?
- Mr. Ames?

01:19.591 --> 01:21.658
Sorry I'm late.
There was traffic.

01:21.783 --> 01:24.375
It's great to be here.
I grew up in new jersey.

01:25.396 --> 01:26.805
Do you know who that is?

01:27.416 --> 01:29.088
That's my colleague.

01:29.264 --> 01:30.829
He does all the driving.

01:32.342 --> 01:33.317
Anyways,

01:33.508 --> 01:35.629
why don't you tell me
what the exact problem is?

01:35.754 --> 01:38.309
I appreciate you wanting
to be discreet on the phone.

01:40.049 --> 01:41.267
I'm being blackmailed.

01:41.920 --> 01:43.412
Why?
What happened?

01:43.537 --> 01:45.551
Well, I've been married 11 years.

01:45.676 --> 01:48.837
I have two little boys.
They're lovely. And my wife and I...

01:51.354 --> 01:54.357
When I was a kid
my parents had separate bedrooms.

01:54.482 --> 01:56.323
I don't think I ever
even saw them kiss.

01:56.535 --> 01:59.090
- That happens a lot.
- Yeah, well, it happened to me.

01:59.215 --> 02:01.619
So I went on Craigslist.

02:03.376 --> 02:07.168
I figured it'd be all right
if I had an affair with a married woman.

02:07.336 --> 02:09.544
Oh, my god,
this woman's body is beautiful.

02:09.713 --> 02:11.131
Did you really meet her?

02:12.320 --> 02:13.253
Sorry.

02:13.781 --> 02:14.633
Go on.

02:15.128 --> 02:17.034
Yeah, we met at a motel,

02:17.159 --> 02:19.814
one of those
that charges by the hour.

02:20.556 --> 02:22.801
Her name was Sophia and she was...

02:22.926 --> 02:24.870
I mean, she is beautiful.

02:26.535 --> 02:29.398
I actually thought that she liked me,
which is pathetic.

02:30.329 --> 02:32.665
Don't beat yourself up.
You were vulnerable.

02:32.790 --> 02:35.035
I don't know how, but she filmed us.

02:35.160 --> 02:37.810
She sent me a copy
and she asked for $1000

02:37.935 --> 02:39.366
or she would show it to my wife.

02:39.590 --> 02:42.362
- You paid?
- I maxed out a credit card

02:42.487 --> 02:44.439
and I thought
the whole thing was over.

02:44.564 --> 02:47.500
But then she called again.
She wants $500 a month.

02:48.537 --> 02:49.585
That is a lot.

02:49.753 --> 02:51.923
I don't have that,
especially not in this economy.

02:52.048 --> 02:53.795
You know, I've got two kids.

02:56.192 --> 02:59.149
Your ad said
that your rates were reasonable.

03:00.181 --> 03:02.389
All the other detectives
were way out of my league.

03:02.557 --> 03:04.757
I charge $100 a day, but I'm good.

03:05.737 --> 03:07.087
I'm one of the...

03:07.832 --> 03:08.896
Well, I'm good.

03:10.229 --> 03:11.629
I can afford that.

03:12.128 --> 03:14.985
I just need you to get
that tape back for me.

03:15.969 --> 03:18.956
The weird thing is
I feel closer to my wife than ever.

03:20.475 --> 03:22.074
I can't lose her now.

03:22.505 --> 03:23.655
I understand.

03:27.865 --> 03:30.501
<i>Will you get me a hamburger to go?
I'm starving.</i>

03:30.710 --> 03:31.959
- Cheese?
- <i>No cheese.</i>

03:32.084 --> 03:33.634
All right, no cheese.

03:36.138 --> 03:38.008
I'll get your tape for you.
I promise.

03:38.947 --> 03:39.947
Excuse me,

03:40.257 --> 03:42.957
can I get a cheeseburger,
no cheese, to go?

03:46.986 --> 03:48.744
- Hello, ladies.
- Good morning.

03:48.869 --> 03:51.769
So just wait here
under these ballerinas, okay?

03:52.324 --> 03:54.237
Okay, I like ballet.

04:00.787 --> 04:03.099
Hey, Jonathan, dear boy, come in.

04:03.535 --> 04:07.464
Got your email. I came by to pick up
the galleys for the new Paul Auster.

04:07.589 --> 04:08.455
Oh, shit.

04:08.623 --> 04:10.499
- What's the matter?
- There's a party tonight

04:10.667 --> 04:13.260
for Gay Talese
at the national arts club.

04:13.453 --> 04:16.212
Another award.
I think he's a great writer,

04:16.337 --> 04:18.591
but how many of these things
can I go to in life?

04:18.759 --> 04:19.755
I don't know.

04:19.880 --> 04:21.878
You go to one
almost every night of the week.

04:22.003 --> 04:24.952
I know, and it's always
the same boring people,

04:25.077 --> 04:27.035
going on 35 years.

04:27.930 --> 04:30.501
Though some die and some press on.

04:31.477 --> 04:33.772
I fall into the press-on category.

04:34.019 --> 04:36.150
Pressing on is good.
Pressing on is heroic.

04:36.578 --> 04:37.448
Maybe.

04:37.573 --> 04:40.827
The first 25 years or so
it all seemed very meaningful.

04:41.443 --> 04:42.741
The past 10 years

04:42.866 --> 04:45.028
I feel like I'm on autopilot.

04:45.201 --> 04:47.128
I may not even be talking right now.

04:47.253 --> 04:49.413
This could be a tape recording.

04:50.145 --> 04:51.245
Your Auster.

04:51.458 --> 04:54.793
Great. I love Paul Auster.
I'll write you a good review.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.762
Yeah, whatever,
but more importantly,

04:56.887 --> 04:59.201
I want you to come with me
tonight to the party.

04:59.326 --> 05:01.574
You can get quotes
for the society page or something.

05:01.699 --> 05:03.761
See, I don't want to go
to the party by myself.

05:03.935 --> 05:05.932
Tonight?
I'm really sorry but I can't.

05:06.057 --> 05:09.099
You never say no.
Don't you need money for the piece?

05:09.267 --> 05:10.317
I do but...

05:10.602 --> 05:12.921
Since when do you play it
so close to the vest?

05:14.163 --> 05:15.272
I don't like secrets.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.969
I'm the only one who gets
to have secrets. Sit down.

05:23.293 --> 05:26.867
- I have another job.
- You're not writing for Antrem at <i>GQ</i> ?

05:27.949 --> 05:31.163
I would never do that to you.
Do you really want to know the truth?

05:31.831 --> 05:33.013
Yes, I do,

05:33.386 --> 05:35.428
as long as it's not boring.

05:38.942 --> 05:41.626
I have a second job
as a private detective.

05:41.751 --> 05:44.468
I haven'ttold you because I thought
you would think it was strange.

05:46.369 --> 05:49.051
If you're going to lie
you need to make it believable.

05:49.176 --> 05:51.475
Throw in an element of truth.
That's what I do.

05:51.643 --> 05:54.011
But I'm not lying.
I have an ad on Craigslist

05:54.136 --> 05:56.702
advertising myself as an
unlicensed private detective.

05:56.827 --> 06:00.067
And tonight in New Jersey
I'm meeting this woman... A blackmailer.

06:01.141 --> 06:03.362
I still don't believe you.
What kind of blackmailer?

06:03.593 --> 06:05.214
She targets married men.

06:05.339 --> 06:08.589
We've been emailing and texting
for the last 24 hours.

06:08.832 --> 06:11.584
I posed as married to lure her in.
And tonight...

06:11.995 --> 06:14.123
And tonight I have to get
my client's sex tape back.

06:15.510 --> 06:17.908
- I want to come with you.
- On my case?

06:19.566 --> 06:21.812
Gay Talese would want me
to do something like this.

06:21.937 --> 06:25.056
To hell with a boring dinner party.
Now don't you see, Jonathan?

06:25.181 --> 06:28.170
This is the kind of journalism
that we need in the magazine.

06:28.295 --> 06:30.673
We'll be writers who fight crime,

06:30.798 --> 06:32.349
give it a big cover story...

06:32.672 --> 06:34.885
You know,
"Blackmailer's brought... "

06:36.151 --> 06:37.847
"Sextortionist brought down

06:37.972 --> 06:40.572
"by George Christopher
and Jonathan Ames."

06:41.269 --> 06:43.879
Or your name would
go first if you want. I'm just...

06:44.004 --> 06:45.461
thinking out loud here.

06:45.586 --> 06:46.655
What do you say?

06:51.828 --> 06:54.580
Ray, this is George... My boss.
He's coming with us.

06:55.009 --> 06:56.756
Nice to meet you.
Heard a lot about you.

06:56.881 --> 06:59.585
Thank you for letting me come on
this adventure with you.

06:59.813 --> 07:02.677
I'm just the driver.
My girlfriend lent us the car.

07:03.641 --> 07:06.244
- A nice car?
- A Subaru, automatic.

07:07.302 --> 07:08.602
What's a Subaru?

07:10.537 --> 07:12.708
Now what's the exact plan?
How are we doing this?

07:12.833 --> 07:15.538
I'm gonna meet the woman at this motel
outside the Lincoln tunnel.

07:15.663 --> 07:18.592
She's supposed to get a room and
call me. But I'm gonna stand her up.

07:18.717 --> 07:21.042
Except we'll be there
and we'll follow her home.

07:21.167 --> 07:22.020
Then what?

07:22.145 --> 07:24.076
- Then the plan gets weak.
- It doesn't.

07:24.201 --> 07:27.028
Either I'll confront her at her home
and ask for the tape back

07:27.153 --> 07:29.142
or we'll wait till she leaves
and we'll break in

07:29.267 --> 07:31.139
and grab the thing and flee.

07:31.264 --> 07:33.073
How are we gonna break in?

07:33.198 --> 07:35.329
I went online.
There's a spy shop in the village.

07:35.836 --> 07:38.082
They have a special lock picker
that opens all doors.

07:38.751 --> 07:41.601
This is all very insane
and illegal, isn't it?

07:43.639 --> 07:45.672
It is illegal.
And insane.

07:46.284 --> 07:48.133
Good.
I like insane.

07:48.798 --> 07:50.398
So this is the Subaru?

07:50.607 --> 07:52.607
Yeah, try not to make a mess.

07:54.790 --> 07:56.269
$700?

07:57.410 --> 07:59.645
- Is that a lot?
- You know, I have no idea.

07:59.878 --> 08:01.271
It could be a good deal,

08:01.715 --> 08:03.232
night vision and all.

08:03.867 --> 08:05.700
Those are top of the line,

08:06.016 --> 08:08.654
very popular in Afghanistan
at 3:00 a.m.

08:09.215 --> 08:11.464
- Howard baker.
- George christopher.

08:11.699 --> 08:13.200
Howard, we'll take one.

08:13.384 --> 08:15.786
- Charge it to the magazine.
- Maybe we won't need them.

08:16.088 --> 08:17.689
You know what, Sunday styles...

08:17.814 --> 08:20.621
I'd hate to think of a situation
where you needed night-vision goggles

08:20.746 --> 08:22.751
and you didn't have
night-vision goggles.

08:24.028 --> 08:26.033
You know, maybe he's got
a good point.

08:26.459 --> 08:27.798
We'll take one of these too.

08:28.267 --> 08:29.482
What are these?

08:30.065 --> 08:31.277
Those...

08:31.402 --> 08:32.676
are cameras.

08:34.130 --> 08:35.681
Look at that.
That's great.

08:38.183 --> 08:39.684
Do you have an e.z. Lock picker?

08:39.852 --> 08:41.318
Yeah, right over here.

08:45.446 --> 08:47.373
I already thought
it was a done deal.

08:47.793 --> 08:49.361
Is he gonna change his mind?

08:51.357 --> 08:52.807
Thanks for calling.

08:55.879 --> 08:58.562
- Is everything okay?
- That was my friend at <i>Esquire</i>.

08:58.687 --> 09:02.374
They won't run the cartoon about me
trying to get the lesbians pregnant.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.742
That was $5000 I was gonna get.

09:05.552 --> 09:08.047
- What happened?
- The senior editors hated it.

09:08.172 --> 09:10.349
They're not even gonna
let me do a revision.

09:10.474 --> 09:12.557
I really needed that cash, man.

09:12.850 --> 09:14.848
I'm sorry.
I know it's not much,

09:14.973 --> 09:16.907
but I'll give you half
of what I make tonight...

09:17.032 --> 09:18.032
50 bucks.

09:18.904 --> 09:19.904
Good.

09:20.377 --> 09:22.936
- That's good for half of a colonic.
- How much for the taser?

09:23.772 --> 09:25.314
I can't sell you that.

09:25.482 --> 09:27.842
- Howard, come on.
- George, it takes special training.

09:27.967 --> 09:30.751
I don't have time.
I gotta close up in 10 minutes.

09:30.876 --> 09:33.655
Man, if I get home late
my wife will kill me.

09:34.273 --> 09:35.951
I mean, I wear the pants,

09:36.076 --> 09:38.869
but she's got the belt,
if you know what I mean.

09:39.037 --> 09:40.537
This pen doesn't work.

09:41.631 --> 09:42.981
That's because...

09:44.056 --> 09:45.185
it's a camera.

09:45.682 --> 09:46.874
Look at that.

09:47.241 --> 09:50.564
You know, I love this place.
I'm gonna do all my shopping here.

09:52.087 --> 09:53.634
We've got a blackmailer to meet.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.149
So who's this fellow?

10:10.190 --> 10:12.486
That's my girlfriend's
kid's toy. It's called Janet.

10:13.578 --> 10:15.155
This unicorn's name is Janet?

10:15.741 --> 10:19.050
Yeah, she likes for her kids
to use real names for some reason.

10:26.672 --> 10:28.085
Yes, this is Ray.

10:29.300 --> 10:32.026
<i>Get us a room and call me
when you're inside.</i>

10:32.215 --> 10:33.853
- <i>I'm almost there.</i>
- But I thought...

10:33.978 --> 10:34.924
<i>See you soon.</i>

10:37.037 --> 10:39.728
- Why'd you use my name?
- It was the first one that came.

10:39.853 --> 10:42.182
- I didn't use your last name.
- So what's going on?

10:42.385 --> 10:44.935
She wants me to rent a room
and call her from inside.

10:46.457 --> 10:49.644
So how are you gonna stand her up
if you're already in the room?

10:52.185 --> 10:54.739
I'll meet her and then
I'll pretend to get cold feet.

10:54.864 --> 10:57.197
The plan still works.
We'll tail her when she leaves.

10:57.950 --> 10:59.350
Sounds good to me.

11:05.874 --> 11:06.874
Oh, boy.

11:09.860 --> 11:11.488
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

11:11.613 --> 11:14.333
She's a blackmailer
but looked very small in her picture.

11:14.458 --> 11:16.685
And I fenced in college.
I have some moves.

11:16.950 --> 11:18.640
Maybe we should have gotten a taser.

11:18.765 --> 11:21.129
No, I don't need a taser.
I'll be okay.

11:22.878 --> 11:24.999
I'm doing this
to save a man's marriage.

11:25.124 --> 11:27.001
He shouldn't be punished
for one mistake.

11:27.126 --> 11:28.526
- Why not?
- Ray.

11:29.428 --> 11:31.744
Hey, we'll be right here
if anything goes wrong.

11:42.106 --> 11:44.161
Hi, it's Ray.
I'm in room 6.

11:44.609 --> 11:45.479
<i>Great.</i>

11:45.899 --> 11:47.318
<i>I'll be right there.</i>

11:47.843 --> 11:49.292
No rush.
No rush.

12:11.285 --> 12:12.712
Not much to see.

12:15.811 --> 12:16.715
In fact,

12:17.252 --> 12:19.446
it's actually
pretty well-lit out there.

12:21.937 --> 12:23.658
Do you mind if I smoke pot in here?

12:24.827 --> 12:25.827
Not at all.

12:27.647 --> 12:29.831
- Can I have some?
- You smoke pot?

12:30.692 --> 12:31.917
Since the '60s.

12:42.457 --> 12:44.199
Look look, here she is.

12:49.768 --> 12:50.811
Oh my God,

12:51.167 --> 12:52.508
she's a knockout.

12:52.897 --> 12:53.947
Let me see.

12:57.081 --> 12:58.474
Coming coming.

13:04.895 --> 13:05.992
Can I come in?

13:09.578 --> 13:10.651
Of course.

13:16.450 --> 13:17.587
Mind if I smoke?

13:18.170 --> 13:21.811
It's actually a non-smoking room,
but for they have an ashtray.

13:21.936 --> 13:24.248
It sort of sends a mixed message.

13:31.763 --> 13:32.763
Just...

13:33.302 --> 13:34.552
sit on the bed?

13:39.769 --> 13:42.669
You're more attractive
than I thought you'd be.

13:43.326 --> 13:45.490
I like a man with a big nose.

13:53.747 --> 13:55.306
Is it really that big?

13:55.431 --> 13:56.631
In a good way.

14:01.983 --> 14:04.183
So you're unhappy with your wife?

14:07.273 --> 14:08.657
My wife?
I'm not...

14:09.285 --> 14:10.532
Right, yes,

14:10.657 --> 14:12.442
my wife... Suzanne.

14:13.965 --> 14:15.712
Things haven't been good.

14:15.837 --> 14:19.133
She thinks I drink too much,
but it's her father who's the...

14:22.003 --> 14:23.887
Maybe this isn't a good idea.

14:24.012 --> 14:26.818
I haven't been with another woman
since Suzanne...

14:26.943 --> 14:28.408
I mean, since Suzanne and I

14:28.576 --> 14:31.477
started having troubles,
and I think I'd better go.

14:31.829 --> 14:34.830
- But it was really nice to meet you...
- Shut up, Ray.

14:36.344 --> 14:37.459
I don't understand.

14:37.712 --> 14:39.795
It was a cartoon about your sperm?

14:41.733 --> 14:44.228
I've been giving my sperm
to these two lesbians.

14:44.353 --> 14:47.010
They're fans of mine.
They want to have a kid.

14:47.337 --> 14:49.346
You're helping lesbians have a baby?

14:50.281 --> 14:51.967
My girlfriend doesn't want
any more kids

14:52.092 --> 14:55.519
and thought, "This is my chance
and I can also help this couple."

14:55.959 --> 14:57.309
That's beautiful.

14:58.222 --> 14:59.356
I have a daughter.

15:00.426 --> 15:01.483
Are you close?

15:01.826 --> 15:03.193
She lives in Seattle.

15:04.252 --> 15:06.117
We love each other but we're...

15:08.252 --> 15:10.073
We don't really know each other.

15:14.931 --> 15:16.865
I have completely failed

15:16.990 --> 15:19.340
at the most important thing in life.

15:21.577 --> 15:23.630
I'm gonna call her
and tell her I love her.

15:23.798 --> 15:26.258
No, you don't want
to high-dial your daughter.

15:26.786 --> 15:29.636
- I'm not that high really.
- I think you are.

15:32.964 --> 15:34.864
I'll use the voice changer.

15:35.584 --> 15:37.394
She won't be able
to tell I'm stoned.

15:37.562 --> 15:38.580
No, here.

15:41.547 --> 15:44.484
Hey, honey, I just called to tell you
that I love you.

15:45.568 --> 15:47.768
This is your father.
I'm a robot.

15:49.095 --> 15:51.533
That's stoned thinking.
You'll scare the shit out of her.

15:51.701 --> 15:52.851
You're right.

15:54.243 --> 15:56.121
Should I send a text message?

16:03.884 --> 16:05.594
- Did you come?
- No, not yet.

16:05.719 --> 16:08.206
- That was a loud yell.
- No, you'll know.

16:09.032 --> 16:11.845
Put a finger in now, okay?
That'll push me over the top.

16:15.492 --> 16:17.267
This is my fleet of super sperms.

16:17.503 --> 16:19.326
I could have really used
that 5 grand.

16:19.451 --> 16:21.324
You're very talented.

16:21.449 --> 16:22.939
I mean, these are amazing.

16:23.107 --> 16:24.107
Really?

16:24.463 --> 16:26.344
Do you think you could publish them?

16:27.688 --> 16:31.544
It's probably too sperm-oriented
for our readership,

16:31.669 --> 16:33.366
but I love your style.

16:33.679 --> 16:34.677
Wait wait.

16:36.015 --> 16:38.747
- What?
- How long has Jonathan been in there?

16:39.732 --> 16:42.040
I don't know.
I'm on marijuana minutes.

16:42.210 --> 16:43.287
Yeah, me too.

16:43.412 --> 16:45.598
I usually set my diver's watch
when I'm stoned

16:45.723 --> 16:47.474
so I know how long it's been.

16:47.847 --> 16:51.259
He could have been in there for 2 h,
but it seems like it's only been 5 min.

16:51.427 --> 16:53.835
I need a new watch.
Are you happy with yours?

16:54.764 --> 16:56.317
Yeah, it's navy seals,

16:56.891 --> 16:58.630
water-resistant up to 200.

16:58.755 --> 17:01.885
- I wear it to the bathtub all the time.
- I should get one of these.

17:02.010 --> 17:04.105
I can't wear mine in the bathtub.

17:11.484 --> 17:13.040
That was amazing.

17:13.928 --> 17:15.265
Get over here now.

17:15.390 --> 17:17.661
You know, they say if babies
don't get touched enough

17:18.452 --> 17:19.570
they die.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.141
I think the same thing
applies to adults,

17:24.348 --> 17:25.348
you know?

17:31.087 --> 17:32.926
The water pressure
is pretty good here.

17:33.094 --> 17:34.761
Your name's not Ray.
It's Jonathan.

17:35.055 --> 17:37.266
- How did you...?
- Jonathan Ames,

17:37.391 --> 17:40.127
181 hamilton street,
Brooklyn, New York.

17:40.476 --> 17:42.936
- That's my license. I can't lose that.
- I videotaped us.

17:43.502 --> 17:45.165
You're gonna pay me $500 now

17:45.290 --> 17:47.482
and $500 a week
for the next 10 weeks.

17:47.650 --> 17:49.813
- Every week? That's more...
- If I don't get my money

17:49.938 --> 17:51.409
your wife gets the tape.

17:53.026 --> 17:54.026
Listen,

17:56.364 --> 17:58.275
I had a really nice time with you,

17:58.400 --> 18:00.297
but I'm holding all the cards here.

18:00.922 --> 18:01.996
I'm not married.

18:03.098 --> 18:05.385
- Who's Suzanne?
- My ex-girlfriend.

18:06.328 --> 18:09.054
You're actually the first
person I've slept with in months.

18:09.179 --> 18:10.588
It was really nice with you,

18:13.507 --> 18:14.551
so you know.

18:16.725 --> 18:19.556
But you're a novelist.
You're in the public eye.

18:19.760 --> 18:21.110
How did you know?

18:21.591 --> 18:24.141
- You've read my work?
- I googled you.

18:24.740 --> 18:26.188
You freelance at <i>Edition NY</i>.

18:26.313 --> 18:28.132
You've written one book,
<i>I pass like night</i>.

18:28.257 --> 18:30.804
And your Amazon ranking
is roughly 447,000.

18:31.152 --> 18:33.194
Amazon's ranking thing is
all screwed up...

18:33.362 --> 18:36.109
I'm gonna put the video
on YouTube, Facebook... Everywhere.

18:36.234 --> 18:37.532
You will be humiliated.

18:38.209 --> 18:39.617
But you had two orgasms.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.286
I want my $500 now.

18:49.872 --> 18:52.149
Have you thought
about going for counseling

18:52.274 --> 18:54.174
to help with your relationship?

18:55.140 --> 18:56.950
I have a wonderful therapist.

18:57.075 --> 18:58.475
He has me doing...

19:00.022 --> 19:01.347
all sorts of things.

19:02.086 --> 19:03.844
I went a few weeks ago.

19:04.065 --> 19:05.365
Leah made me go.

19:05.625 --> 19:07.520
She also made me
go get some colonics.

19:07.754 --> 19:09.272
I'd like a colonic.

19:11.041 --> 19:12.674
Hey, let me see, let me see.

19:12.799 --> 19:13.849
Be patient.

19:17.791 --> 19:19.541
Can I draw you next?

19:19.780 --> 19:21.451
I haven't drawn in years.

19:21.975 --> 19:23.825
I want to be like a child.

19:23.969 --> 19:25.369
I want to be free.

19:29.511 --> 19:30.511
Please.

19:34.704 --> 19:36.454
- Did he pay?
- Not yet.

19:36.726 --> 19:39.052
He's only got 40 bucks.
We'll go out to the ATM.

19:39.330 --> 19:42.305
- Who are you?
- I'm the guy with the taser.

19:42.473 --> 19:44.766
Do you shop at the spy store
on Christopher street?

19:45.061 --> 19:46.995
Shut up.
$500 now

19:47.120 --> 19:49.729
and $500 for the next 10 weeks
or I will fuck you up.

19:49.897 --> 19:52.690
Listen, I'm a writer.
I don't make that kind of money.

19:56.758 --> 19:58.071
That's not cool, man.

19:58.239 --> 19:59.787
That really hurt, all right?

19:59.912 --> 20:01.866
You need special training to use it.

20:02.099 --> 20:03.615
Get your fucking pants on.

20:03.740 --> 20:06.911
- You didn't have to hurt him.
- You do your thing, I'll do mine.

20:18.839 --> 20:20.486
$500.
Let's go.

20:26.451 --> 20:28.351
It'll only let me take out
$200 at a time.

20:28.615 --> 20:30.760
So make three withdrawals, genius.

20:30.885 --> 20:34.107
- But that's 3 separate service charges.
- Look, I will taser your face.

20:34.232 --> 20:36.603
Okay, I'm just saying you
should at least acknowledge

20:36.728 --> 20:39.112
that I'm now basically paying $509.

20:55.510 --> 20:57.380
I feel like a child again.
I'm drawing.

20:57.548 --> 20:59.632
What the hell?
Didn't you see what was going on?

20:59.834 --> 21:01.002
What happened?

21:01.127 --> 21:03.247
Follow that van.
That guy tasered me.

21:03.372 --> 21:06.022
- Look what I drew.
- Just follow the van.

21:17.716 --> 21:19.985
- Now what?
- I gotta go get those tapes back.

21:20.110 --> 21:22.947
Are you nuts? You can't go in
there. He's tasered you already.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.283
- But I need to get those tapes.
- Who cares?

21:25.451 --> 21:26.959
There's a sex tape of you online.

21:27.084 --> 21:29.913
I can't think of anybody's career
who hasn't been helped by a sex tape.

21:30.158 --> 21:32.010
Could even help a writer like you.

21:32.905 --> 21:34.746
Are you working on your novel?

21:35.294 --> 21:37.587
Please, I don't want
to talk about my writing.

21:37.755 --> 21:39.753
I have to get that tape
back for Mr. Eaton.

21:39.878 --> 21:42.374
He's got 2 kids. It's a sexless marriage
but he loves her.

21:42.499 --> 21:44.889
Who cares about that guy?
Are you gonna get yourself maimed

21:45.014 --> 21:47.221
for $100...
$50 if we split it?

21:47.556 --> 21:49.048
What do you think, George?

21:49.490 --> 21:51.047
I don't really have an opinion.

21:51.172 --> 21:52.795
I'm too stoned to think.

21:52.920 --> 21:54.729
But I'm having a really good time.

22:01.205 --> 22:02.592
I thought he saw us.

22:02.717 --> 22:04.867
The pot's making me so paranoid.

22:11.252 --> 22:14.422
- She's alone in there. I'm going in.
- I think we should just give up.

22:14.621 --> 22:16.501
There's no problem with failure.
I do it often.

22:16.694 --> 22:18.836
But if I can get her alone
I can reason with her.

22:20.639 --> 22:23.007
It's okay. She had two orgasms.
She must like me.

22:23.175 --> 22:25.426
- How do you know she wasn't faking?
- She wasn't.

22:25.594 --> 22:29.042
- Two orgasms?
- Yes, it was kind of amazing. I'm...

22:29.673 --> 22:32.383
Anyway, and I could tell
that she felt bad when he tasered me.

22:32.508 --> 22:34.291
I think she really likes me.

22:34.416 --> 22:35.937
Will you reason with him?

22:36.288 --> 22:37.563
I think he should go in.

22:37.731 --> 22:39.072
See?
Now listen.

22:39.594 --> 22:42.402
If that guy comes back you need
to call my cell phone and warn me.

22:42.570 --> 22:44.070
Definitely.
I can handle that.

22:44.238 --> 22:45.238
All right.

22:45.679 --> 22:47.429
I'm counting on you guys.

22:50.704 --> 22:52.304
So please no more pot.

22:52.512 --> 22:54.122
Just keep an eye out, okay?

22:54.635 --> 22:57.635
She's gonna face the music
and I'm gonna play it.

22:59.329 --> 23:00.448
Good luck.

23:10.368 --> 23:11.931
What are you doing here?

23:12.099 --> 23:14.767
I want the tapes...
Not just mine, all of them.

23:15.101 --> 23:17.411
- You followed me?
- Of course I followed you.

23:17.536 --> 23:21.277
And I want my tape and
Mr. Eaton's and my money

23:21.402 --> 23:23.651
and I guess that's it.

23:23.900 --> 23:25.254
You know Mr. Eaton?

23:25.907 --> 23:27.007
He hired me.

23:27.206 --> 23:28.891
I'm a private detective.

23:29.016 --> 23:31.766
I'm also a writer
with a bad Amazon ranking,

23:32.074 --> 23:34.162
but that doesn't mean
I can't call the cops.

23:34.330 --> 23:35.656
No cops, please.

23:35.781 --> 23:37.541
Why not?
It's the next logical step.

23:37.666 --> 23:39.625
It wasn't my idea.
My brother made me do it.

23:40.060 --> 23:41.560
The cops won't care.

23:42.120 --> 23:44.548
You'll probably get at least
five years for extortion.

23:44.673 --> 23:45.492
But...

23:47.218 --> 23:49.469
You could call me when you get out.

23:50.422 --> 23:53.913
My brother's got gambling debts.
If I didn't help they're gonna kill him.

23:54.038 --> 23:56.338
And this was what you came up with?

23:56.970 --> 23:58.896
If he made you do this...

23:59.155 --> 24:01.155
Even if we had a good time...

24:01.454 --> 24:03.775
Then I'm not sure he's
a brother worth saving.

24:05.843 --> 24:09.370
So give me those tapes
and your word that you'll stop,

24:09.495 --> 24:12.366
- and I'll leave the cops out of it.
- You promise?

24:12.809 --> 24:15.036
Now give me those tapes
and the money.

24:33.256 --> 24:35.431
Here.
We only did it twice, I swear...

24:36.535 --> 24:37.935
You and Mr. Eaton.

24:39.093 --> 24:40.493
He was a nice guy.

24:41.820 --> 24:43.481
But you liked me better, right?

24:44.646 --> 24:45.942
I don't want to compare.

24:52.195 --> 24:54.200
- Oh, shit.
- You gotta call Jonathan.

24:54.442 --> 24:56.192
- What?
- Call Jonathan.

24:58.157 --> 25:00.711
- I can't get a signal.
- Stupid New Jersey.

25:02.634 --> 25:03.876
Don't go in the house.

25:06.255 --> 25:08.198
He went in the house.
We gotta go in there.

25:08.323 --> 25:09.632
We gotta go in the house.

25:09.816 --> 25:11.425
What the fuck are you doing here?

25:12.803 --> 25:15.366
Wait wait, what do I use
for a weapon?

25:19.457 --> 25:20.691
She extends?

25:29.729 --> 25:31.647
We're business partners.

25:31.772 --> 25:33.406
- Really?
- All three of us.

25:33.574 --> 25:34.574
Kill!

25:40.339 --> 25:41.339
Damn!

25:49.467 --> 25:51.754
Get in the car.
George, come on.

25:55.111 --> 25:56.354
Come on, go!

26:02.084 --> 26:03.519
Hurry.
He's gonna catch us.

26:03.887 --> 26:04.687
Floor it.

26:04.892 --> 26:06.740
I am. This car sucks.

26:10.944 --> 26:11.944
Shit.

26:18.440 --> 26:19.440
Fuck you.

26:20.311 --> 26:22.830
You too.
We did it!

26:29.929 --> 26:31.362
This is not good.

26:31.897 --> 26:34.550
Let me handle this.
Is there a problem, officer?

26:37.738 --> 26:40.504
I think this is the best night
I've had in years.

26:40.909 --> 26:43.284
It's 5:30 in the morning, George.

26:43.642 --> 26:46.854
Come on, what's wrong with you guys?
Show some team spirit.

26:47.120 --> 26:48.689
The cops found Ray's pipe.

26:49.071 --> 26:50.911
We already smoked everything.

26:51.036 --> 26:52.818
It's not illegal
to have a glass pipe.

26:53.004 --> 26:55.354
Residue.
Plus driving while impaired.

26:55.499 --> 26:57.933
Hey, fellows, listen to me.
Don't worry, all right?

26:58.058 --> 27:01.410
The magazine has had a criminal lawyer
on retainer for years.

27:01.739 --> 27:03.989
I'm gonna make all of this go away.

27:04.297 --> 27:07.566
Sometimes one has to embrace
one's place in society.

27:07.691 --> 27:09.919
Leah is gonna kill me
when she sees that fender.

27:10.585 --> 27:11.754
And we lost Janet.

27:14.559 --> 27:16.159
I'm sorry about Janet.

27:17.961 --> 27:21.222
But, the car just needs a little work.
We'll find a body shop.

27:21.390 --> 27:25.184
- I can't afford a body shop right now.
- I have a solution for that too.

27:25.352 --> 27:26.952
I'm full of solutions.

27:27.262 --> 27:28.612
I want to pay you

27:29.266 --> 27:33.270
and Jonathan to collaborate on a comic
for the magazine

27:33.440 --> 27:34.860
about this whole case.

27:35.124 --> 27:38.072
I mean, my original cover story idea
was way too grandiose.

27:38.431 --> 27:40.428
But a comic is better, right?

27:40.553 --> 27:42.505
I mean, comics are really in now.

27:42.779 --> 27:44.704
Could be fun.
We've never worked together.

27:45.020 --> 27:47.522
I don't give a shit about that.
I need the money.

27:49.042 --> 27:51.544
No, thank you for a great night.

27:51.820 --> 27:54.654
I am still stoned.
That was really good pot.

27:55.678 --> 27:57.186
God.
Don't say that.
