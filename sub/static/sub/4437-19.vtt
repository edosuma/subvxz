09:42.540 --> 09:44.383
I even know what
you're thinking right now.

09:44.626 --> 09:45.468
That's impossible!

09:45.668 --> 09:47.045
No one can guess
what I'm thinking!

09:49.005 --> 09:50.803
Whoa!
Where are we, bro?

09:51.007 --> 09:54.136
We must be in heaven,
'cause I just saw an angel.

09:54.302 --> 09:55.804
I'm never letting go
of your leg!

09:55.970 --> 09:57.517
You're out of your league, kids.

09:57.514 --> 10:00.313
Turn around now, before you
see something you might regret.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.227
Later, suckers!

10:03.978 --> 10:05.150
We're going in.

10:05.355 --> 10:07.403
Mabel, can we leave
those guys out here?

10:07.607 --> 10:09.701
Looking at them hurts my eyes.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.783
No!
They can help us!

10:11.986 --> 10:14.114
Xyler and Craz:
Totally! Arm throne!

10:14.322 --> 10:16.290
( Mabel giggles )

10:16.533 --> 10:18.786
-( sighs )
- Dude, arm throne!

10:19.160 --> 10:21.504
- Arm throne!
- Ah!

10:22.664 --> 10:24.382
- Xyler and Craz: Whoa!
- Mabel: Neato!

10:24.374 --> 10:27.378
- Craz: Radical!
- Xyler: I also think it's radical!

10:30.713 --> 10:32.306
Stan: No refunds!
No refunds!

10:32.465 --> 10:33.136
( Echoing ) No refunds!
No refunds!

10:33.383 --> 10:34.760
( Growling )

10:38.221 --> 10:39.188
( Stan speaking indistinctly )

10:39.389 --> 10:41.858
Soos: Whoa, look!
All of Stan's memories.

10:42.934 --> 10:44.186
Great, sure there's
plenty of memories

10:44.394 --> 10:46.067
of Stan bossing me around.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.063
Can't wait to see more of that!

10:47.272 --> 10:48.148
Come on, Dipper.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.108
We've gotta find the code
before Bill does.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.488
Mabel is talking!

10:51.693 --> 10:52.785
So rad!

10:53.027 --> 10:53.994
Let's get searching!

10:54.195 --> 10:55.492
( Panting )

10:58.533 --> 10:59.409
Jorge, Rico,

10:59.742 --> 11:01.494
you're the two best
Colombian prison friends

11:01.703 --> 11:02.704
a fella could make.

11:06.332 --> 11:07.128
Nope.

11:07.834 --> 11:10.587
Sir, would you like
to buy a Stan-Vac vacuum?

11:10.795 --> 11:13.514
Stan-Vac: It sucks more
than anything.

11:14.257 --> 11:15.008
Gotta work on that.

11:15.216 --> 11:16.012
Nope.

11:17.927 --> 11:20.897
Whoa!
It's Stan on a date!

11:21.222 --> 11:24.567
So, your, uh,
your eye is weird.

11:24.767 --> 11:26.235
Let's, let's talk
about that.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.359
( Iaughil19 )

11:28.563 --> 11:31.362
( both laughing )

11:31.566 --> 11:32.863
<i>This is going terrible.</i>

11:33.067 --> 11:34.489
<i>I can't think
of anything to say,</i>

11:34.485 --> 11:36.908
<i>and she looks weird up close.</i>

11:37.113 --> 11:38.410
<i>Think of a way out.</i>

11:39.657 --> 11:41.705
Non-specific excuse!

11:41.910 --> 11:43.912
( Grunts, panting )

11:45.163 --> 11:46.164
Yeesh!

11:47.457 --> 11:49.004
Look, guys.
Memories about me.

11:49.626 --> 11:51.219
That doesn't seem
like a good idea.

11:51.419 --> 11:53.421
I just want to know what the
old guy really thinks of me.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.598
We already know how
Stan feels about us,

11:55.798 --> 11:57.516
he loves us!
We're great.

11:57.717 --> 11:58.764
Yeah, let's
just keep moving.

11:58.968 --> 12:00.470
- More moving?
- Yes!

12:00.678 --> 12:02.146
I love motion!

12:09.938 --> 12:11.815
Okay, just a quick peek.

12:12.607 --> 12:13.483
Stan: <i>Dipper, my back itches,
can you scratch it?</i>

12:13.691 --> 12:15.409
<i>Dipper, clean the boiler!</i>

12:15.610 --> 12:17.112
( Stan laughs)

12:17.528 --> 12:18.279
No buts!

12:18.488 --> 12:19.956
Now go chop that
firewood already!

12:20.573 --> 12:21.415
Ah!

12:23.576 --> 12:25.203
Dude, Stan, I been
meaning to ask you.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.084
Why are you so hard on
Dipper all the time?

12:27.664 --> 12:29.211
Look, Soos, I'm gonna
let you in on something.

12:29.415 --> 12:30.667
You wanna know what
I really think?

12:30.875 --> 12:32.877
( Indistinct whispering )

12:33.503 --> 12:35.130
The kid's a loser.
He's weak.

12:35.338 --> 12:36.806
He's an utter embarrassment.

12:38.007 --> 12:39.930
I just want to get rid of him.

12:47.016 --> 12:49.439
Hello, code to Stan's safe,
where are you?

12:50.061 --> 12:52.029
Opening and closing
doors is fun.

12:52.230 --> 12:53.573
I can do it also!

12:56.776 --> 12:58.369
If only people knew the truth.

12:58.569 --> 13:00.196
That hidden behind
this vending machine,

13:00.613 --> 13:02.206
- I secretly have a--
- Boring!

13:03.533 --> 13:04.329
All right, guys,

13:04.534 --> 13:06.878
I have a good feeling
about this door.

13:08.037 --> 13:09.539
Hey, Mr. Tummy.

13:09.747 --> 13:11.090
( High-pitched voice )
Hey, Mr. Stan!

13:11.291 --> 13:12.417
( Normal ) Are you hungry?

13:12.583 --> 13:14.005
( High-pitched voice ) Yes.

13:14.210 --> 13:15.712
-( Normal ) Eat your crackers!
- Soos: Ugh!

13:15.920 --> 13:17.217
( High-pitched voice
chomping and giggling )

13:17.422 --> 13:18.844
Sweet Sally.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.220
Oh, we've been
searching forever.

13:20.383 --> 13:22.932
What if the triangle guy
finds the memory before we do?

13:23.094 --> 13:26.018
If we wanna find Stan's memory,
we gotta think like Stan.

13:26.180 --> 13:27.898
He's always hiding stuff, right?

13:28.057 --> 13:29.684
Yeah, like how he hides
his arrest warrants

13:29.851 --> 13:31.319
under that rug in the gift shop?

13:31.311 --> 13:32.813
Soos, that's it!
Look!

13:38.735 --> 13:39.861
(all gasp)

13:44.949 --> 13:45.745
There ya go.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.002
And now to input the code.

13:48.202 --> 13:51.422
Thirteen, forty-fou r,
and finally--

13:52.457 --> 13:53.709
- Dude, we found it!
- Yeah!

13:53.916 --> 13:55.259
Guys: But what
do we do now?

13:55.460 --> 13:56.177
Jinx!

13:56.377 --> 13:58.175
Um, um, let's just
destroy the door

13:58.379 --> 13:59.676
before Bill can find it.

14:02.467 --> 14:04.219
Wait!
Maybe I should do it!

14:04.385 --> 14:06.934
My big fat arms are great
at destroying stuff.

14:07.096 --> 14:07.847
Oh, okay-

14:13.269 --> 14:13.895
HEY, guys!

14:14.103 --> 14:14.945
I just saw
a memory of Stan

14:15.146 --> 14:16.944
roller skating
and wearing short-shorts!

14:17.398 --> 14:18.741
Didn't look--didn't look
half bad.

14:20.443 --> 14:21.569
Hey, something weird
is going on here.

14:21.778 --> 14:23.576
( laughs )

14:25.656 --> 14:26.578
(all gasp)

14:26.991 --> 14:28.368
Boy, you kids sure are gullible!

14:28.576 --> 14:30.294
I knew you'd lead me
straight to the code!

14:30.495 --> 14:33.499
(evil laughing )

14:34.248 --> 14:35.841
It's funny how dumb you are.

14:36.834 --> 14:39.007
The combination to Stan's safe!

14:39.253 --> 14:41.005
Boy, that was even easier
than I thought.

14:41.381 --> 14:42.257
Oh, yeah?

14:42.590 --> 14:43.637
Well, you're a...

14:43.841 --> 14:45.559
A stink-face!

14:45.760 --> 14:47.387
Awesome comeback, Mabel!

14:47.595 --> 14:49.017
Don't treat me
like a child, Xyler.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.145
- Later, suckers!
-( all yell )

14:52.183 --> 14:53.935
Come on, we've got to save Stan!

14:54.143 --> 14:55.486
Dipper:
What's the point?

14:56.604 --> 14:57.947
Why should I save him, huh?

14:58.189 --> 14:59.611
I work for Stan day and night,

14:59.816 --> 15:02.695
and all he does in return is
say he wants to get rid of me.

15:03.027 --> 15:05.155
Dipper, I'm sure
that's not true.

15:05.363 --> 15:07.661
I saw it with my own eyes
in one of his memories, Mabel!

15:07.865 --> 15:09.708
He's always picked on me
and now I know why!

15:10.034 --> 15:11.286
Stan hates me!

15:11.536 --> 15:12.412
(all gasp)

15:12.620 --> 15:14.122
Dipper, it doesn't
matter what you saw.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.628
If we don't stop Bill,
we'll lose the Shack!

15:16.833 --> 15:18.835
No, you know what?
Not this time.

15:19.043 --> 15:21.842
For once, this is one of Stan's
problems I'm not gonna fix.

15:22.797 --> 15:24.299
Fine!
Come on, Soos.

15:24.465 --> 15:26.217
We'll save Stan ourselves!

15:26.676 --> 15:29.600
Dipper, you're a cool dude,
but this isn't cool, dude.

15:29.804 --> 15:31.147
Craz:
Let's go, Xyler!

15:31.389 --> 15:32.561
Xyler:
All right, Craz!

15:32.765 --> 15:33.982
Craz:
Those are our names!

15:40.106 --> 15:42.074
( Phone ringing )

15:42.733 --> 15:44.155
- Yello?
- Bill!

15:44.360 --> 15:46.408
Did you find the memory
with the combination yet?

15:46.612 --> 15:48.910
Relax, shortstack,
I got it right here.

15:49.115 --> 15:50.742
( laughs )
Perfect!

15:50.950 --> 15:51.576
Now give it to me

15:51.784 --> 15:53.411
and I'll fulfill
my end of the bargain.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.621
Finally! It's--
you got a pen there?

15:56.122 --> 15:59.422
It's thirteen, forty-four--

16:00.126 --> 16:01.719
Ah! N
0&2?' Wait!

16:01.919 --> 16:03.671
Stan: None more bottomless
than the bottomless pit.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.848
Which, as you can see here,
is bottomless.

16:06.048 --> 16:08.551
Whoo! Whatever that was,
it's gone forever.

16:10.803 --> 16:11.804
Ha ha! Boom!

16:12.013 --> 16:12.889
Xyler and Craz:
Mabel did it!

16:13.306 --> 16:14.353
The shack is safe!

16:14.557 --> 16:15.308
The deal's off!

16:15.516 --> 16:16.312
Wait. No! Wait!

16:16.517 --> 16:17.860
I'm switching to plan B!

16:22.607 --> 16:23.358
You!

16:23.566 --> 16:26.570
You can't even imagine
what you just cost me!

16:26.819 --> 16:28.821
Do you have
any idea what I'm like

16:28.988 --> 16:31.036
( distorted )
when I'm mad?

16:44.045 --> 16:44.796
( Mabel gasps )

16:45.004 --> 16:46.927
Soos: So I guess he gets
really mad when he gets mad.

16:47.465 --> 16:49.388
Eat nightmares!

16:49.592 --> 16:50.684
( Screaming )

16:51.677 --> 16:53.725
(grunts) How do I
get out of this place?

16:54.305 --> 16:55.932
Exit? Hello?

16:59.560 --> 17:00.402
Ah, this again?

17:00.603 --> 17:01.980
Stan: He's a loser.
He's weak.

17:02.188 --> 17:03.986
I just want to
get rid of him.

17:04.232 --> 17:04.983
( Chuckles )

17:05.316 --> 17:07.569
Yeah, those are all
things people said

17:07.777 --> 17:08.903
about me when I was a boy.

17:09.111 --> 17:09.737
Huh?

17:10.279 --> 17:11.201
It was terrible.

17:11.446 --> 17:13.324
I was the biggest wimp
on the playground.

17:15.326 --> 17:16.703
( Whimpers )

17:16.911 --> 17:18.913
-( laughil19 )
-( crying )

17:19.914 --> 17:22.792
Stan: So one summer my pop
signs me up for boxing lessons.

17:23.542 --> 17:24.886
And it was even worse
than the schoolyard!

17:25.086 --> 17:26.303
Left hook!

17:28.839 --> 17:31.638
You know, at the time, I thought
my pop was trying to torture me.

17:32.093 --> 17:32.764
But wouldn't you know it?

17:32.969 --> 17:34.937
The old man was doin' me
a favor all along.

17:35.179 --> 17:35.805
Give me that bag!

17:36.013 --> 17:36.889
Help!
MY Purse!

17:37.098 --> 17:38.725
- Woman: Help!
- Left hook!

17:38.933 --> 17:39.855
Ah!

17:41.143 --> 17:43.987
( Cheering )

17:44.188 --> 17:45.110
So you see?

17:45.314 --> 17:46.361
That's why I'm
hard on Dipper.

17:46.566 --> 17:47.362
To toughen him up,

17:47.567 --> 17:49.661
so when the world fights,
he fights back.

17:50.987 --> 17:52.580
Do you think it's
actually working?

17:53.948 --> 17:55.370
I, I did it!

17:56.200 --> 17:56.871
Yes!

17:57.076 --> 17:58.077
He's really comin' along.

17:58.369 --> 18:01.122
When push comes to shove,
I'm actually proud of him.

18:01.789 --> 18:03.132
Just don't ever tell him that.

18:03.416 --> 18:04.713
His head's big enough as it is.

18:05.418 --> 18:06.419
Soos: That's true.

18:10.464 --> 18:12.011
Whoa, kid, what are
you doin' here?

18:12.216 --> 18:13.763
Nice hole in your chest,
by the way.

18:14.135 --> 18:15.102
Let's fix that up.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.931
W-- What the--
How did you do that?

18:19.432 --> 18:21.560
Word to the wise, kid,
we're in the mind.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.769
You could do whatever
you can imagine in here.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.232
Well, how about that.

18:28.482 --> 18:30.075
-( Bill laughing )
- Soos: No! Make it stop!

18:30.276 --> 18:32.199
Mabel: Help!
Someone, please!

18:32.403 --> 18:33.746
Oh, my gosh, what am I doing?

18:33.946 --> 18:35.038
I gotta stop Bill!

18:35.865 --> 18:37.959
Huh.
Fightin' back.

18:39.285 --> 18:41.287
One nightmare, coming up!

18:41.704 --> 18:42.330
Nightmare?

18:42.538 --> 18:44.006
Hope he doesn't mean
that British dog-man

18:44.206 --> 18:45.674
I'm always dreaming about.

18:46.375 --> 18:47.592
( British accent )
'Ello, 'ello, 'ello!

18:47.793 --> 18:49.386
Who's crike for
a shdig in the pudding?

18:49.545 --> 18:51.923
Ah! It's everything
I ever feared!

18:52.214 --> 18:52.965
You!

18:55.009 --> 18:57.979
Ahh! My cuteness!

18:58.554 --> 19:02.149
( Distorted )
What did you do to my cuteness--

19:02.350 --> 19:03.693
( spitting )

19:03.893 --> 19:05.315
You're next!
