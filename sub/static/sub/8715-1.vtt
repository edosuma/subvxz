00:43.260 --> 00:45.160
Are you really here with me?

00:46.930 --> 00:50.260
- I'm here.
- And you'll never leave me?

00:50.370 --> 00:52.430
Never.

00:52.540 --> 00:56.100
- Promise?
- Promise.

00:56.210 --> 00:58.110
How can I be certain?

00:58.210 --> 01:01.510
Because the two
shall become one.

01:18.300 --> 01:21.750
What a wonderful life
you've given me, Clark.

01:21.870 --> 01:25.600
What a wonderful life
we've made together.

02:23.390 --> 02:28.190
Lord, we're grateful that the soil is warm
and ready to be planted.

02:28.300 --> 02:30.630
And we ask that
this season's crop be bountiful.

02:30.730 --> 02:33.860
We thank you
for this nourishment before us.

02:33.970 --> 02:38.600
Bless it to our bodies
and bless this day. Amen.

02:38.710 --> 02:40.840
Amen.

02:40.940 --> 02:43.310
Hey, where's Missie?

02:45.420 --> 02:51.050
"I thank you again and again for the honor
you've done me in your proposals...

02:51.150 --> 02:54.120
"but to accept them
is absolutely impossible.

02:54.220 --> 02:57.190
"I mean, my feelings
in every respect forbid it.

02:57.290 --> 03:01.700
Now, can I speak any plainer?"

03:19.920 --> 03:23.040
Hyah! Hyah!

03:24.920 --> 03:30.050
And I think I'm old enough
to be riding by myself to school.

03:30.160 --> 03:35.100
Charlie's a good horse, and he don't like
standing around all day with nothing to do.

03:35.200 --> 03:38.100
How do you know
he don't like standing around?

03:38.200 --> 03:40.100
- From Charlie.
- Hyah!

03:40.200 --> 03:43.040
Hey. That was Missie...

03:45.380 --> 03:47.610
on Charlie.

03:47.710 --> 03:50.410
I believe it was.

03:52.720 --> 03:54.620
Hyah!

04:26.350 --> 04:29.980
Take your seats and get out
your reading primers.

04:30.090 --> 04:32.280
Quickly, please.

04:35.160 --> 04:38.590
All right. Daniel, please start reading
from the top of page 25.

04:45.840 --> 04:50.240
Just makin' sure the teacher
made it here safely.

04:50.340 --> 04:54.300
Well, here I am, safe and sound.

04:54.410 --> 04:57.870
I would appreciate it, though, if you made
sure that Arnie and Aaron got here on time.

04:57.980 --> 05:00.640
It's disruptive to the rest of the class
when they enter late.

05:00.750 --> 05:05.050
Well, I think they're gonna be here
on time from now on.

05:05.160 --> 05:08.680
You have a very nice day,
Miss Davis.

05:12.230 --> 05:15.460
- All right, Daniel.
- Yes, ma'am.

05:21.870 --> 05:25.830
Get on up. Ho.

05:28.880 --> 05:33.150
- How you doin', Zeke?
- Gettin' by.

05:33.280 --> 05:37.380
I just took the boys to school.
Late again.

05:37.490 --> 05:40.290
I'll tell you, though,
I wish they'd stay young forever.

05:40.390 --> 05:42.790
How old's that boy
of yours now?

05:42.890 --> 05:45.730
He'll be 10
on his next birthday.

05:45.830 --> 05:49.630
- And the younger one?
- Arnie? He's seven.

05:49.730 --> 05:52.400
He's got it in his head, though,
that one of these days...

05:52.500 --> 05:55.230
he and Aaron are going to swap places
and he's gonna be the older brother.

05:55.340 --> 05:57.810
Yeah, well.

05:57.910 --> 06:02.310
Boys sure are
full of big ideas.

06:02.410 --> 06:05.070
Yeah.

06:05.180 --> 06:07.310
Any word from your boy?

06:09.750 --> 06:13.380
Well, like you said...

06:13.490 --> 06:16.580
boys are full of big ideas.

06:27.800 --> 06:30.030
Lunch.

06:48.120 --> 06:50.590
No. Get your own.

06:54.130 --> 06:56.260
I was wondering if you'd
do me a favor, Clara.

06:56.370 --> 06:59.530
I'm just not hungry today,
but I don't want my lunch to go to waste.

06:59.640 --> 07:02.370
- Maybe you'd eat it for me?
- I'd like to help you, Miss Davis.

07:02.470 --> 07:04.870
Thank you, Clara.

07:08.310 --> 07:10.210
I'll be stepping out
for a few minutes.

07:10.310 --> 07:12.540
Charlotte will be in charge
while I'm gone...

07:12.650 --> 07:16.280
and she'll report to me the names of anyone
breaking any class rules in my absence.

07:16.390 --> 07:18.980
Anyone.

07:27.030 --> 07:30.560
I got it level.

07:56.190 --> 08:00.320
Give the men a break for lunch.
I'll be back.

08:00.430 --> 08:05.300
You're the boss.
All right, that's lunch.

08:12.640 --> 08:16.440
Is this a private lunch
or can anyone dine here?

08:16.550 --> 08:19.310
I hope I didn't startle you.

08:19.420 --> 08:21.350
No.

08:21.450 --> 08:23.480
I'm Grant Thomas.

08:23.590 --> 08:25.780
Missie Davis.

08:25.890 --> 08:27.820
Well, Missie Davis...

08:27.920 --> 08:30.720
I have surveyed hundreds of miles of land
west of the Mississippi...

08:30.830 --> 08:33.630
but today is the first time
I've ever seen anything as pretty as you...

08:33.730 --> 08:35.630
in the viewfinder
of my transit.

08:35.730 --> 08:38.220
I was picking berries.

08:38.340 --> 08:41.860
Not a very substantial midday meal,
if you don't mind my saying so.

08:41.970 --> 08:44.940
Did you say you have a transit?

08:45.040 --> 08:47.030
Yes. It's a device used to
measure the...

08:47.140 --> 08:49.870
Horizontal and vertical
angles of the land.

08:49.980 --> 08:52.880
- That's right.
- And you have one close by?

08:52.980 --> 08:54.710
Would you like to see?

09:08.430 --> 09:10.730
- Would you like to look?
- Mm-hmm.

09:12.770 --> 09:15.900
- Allow me.
- Thank you.

09:23.450 --> 09:26.540
- That's amazing.
- Hmm.

09:26.650 --> 09:29.950
What are you all doing here?

09:30.050 --> 09:32.350
Follow me.

09:39.900 --> 09:43.700
We work for the Continental Railroad Company.
It's our job to survey the lines...

09:43.800 --> 09:48.460
to find the best and shortest routes
for the men who lay the tracks.

09:48.570 --> 09:52.130
That's a Vernier solar compass.
It shows us which direction is true north.

09:52.240 --> 09:55.210
I've read about equipment
like this.

09:55.310 --> 09:57.710
I know you said
you're not hungry, but...

09:57.810 --> 10:00.940
maybe you'd consider
joining me for lunch.

10:01.050 --> 10:04.750
I'm sorry.
I really have to go. I'm late.

10:04.850 --> 10:06.380
Late?

10:08.390 --> 10:10.290
Thanks.

10:16.670 --> 10:20.120
- Are you sure you have to go?
- I'm afraid so.

10:20.240 --> 10:23.730
But it was nice to meet you,
and good luck with all your work here.

10:33.020 --> 10:35.780
Let me in.

10:35.890 --> 10:38.750
Let me in.

10:40.620 --> 10:43.250
I know you're responsible for this,
Brian Murphy.

10:43.360 --> 10:48.850
Get off this door.
I'm giving you one last chance.

10:48.970 --> 10:52.590
Fine, have it your way.
I'm leaving and coming back with your pa.

10:56.040 --> 11:00.480
I'm sorry. I assure you it isn't my desire
to startle you every time we meet.

11:00.580 --> 11:05.280
No. It's fine.
I was just about to go in and teach a class.

11:06.480 --> 11:08.950
I'm the teacher.

11:09.050 --> 11:11.780
Well, I don't mean to hold you up,
but you left this.

11:11.890 --> 11:14.020
Thank you.

11:14.120 --> 11:17.580
I understand now why you couldn't
accept my invitation for lunch.

11:17.690 --> 11:22.130
So maybe you'll accept my next invitation
to dine with me for lunch?

11:22.230 --> 11:25.690
A week from Saturday?
It's not a school day.

11:25.800 --> 11:29.000
- Unless you have a steady beau.
- No.

11:29.110 --> 11:33.570
- No, you won't dine with me?
- No. I mean, no, I don't have a steady beau.

11:33.680 --> 11:37.580
- Oh.
- Yes. I would be delighted to dine with you.

11:37.680 --> 11:41.140
Wonderful. I hear the hotel dining room
has the best food in town.

11:41.250 --> 11:43.150
I could arrange
for transportation.

11:43.250 --> 11:45.520
Oh, no. That's all right.
I'll meet you there.

11:47.460 --> 11:51.090
- Around noon?
- Noon would be perfect.

11:53.300 --> 11:55.360
Better get back to my class.

11:55.470 --> 11:59.370
All right. Good-bye.

12:01.370 --> 12:03.670
Good-bye.

12:13.880 --> 12:19.010
And this handsome and mysterious stranger
rides up on this mighty steed...

12:19.120 --> 12:21.420
and sweeps me off my feet.

12:21.520 --> 12:24.150
- Missie Davis, you are making that up.
- I'm not.

12:24.260 --> 12:27.890
It really happened. His name's Grant Thomas,
and he works for the railroad.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.300
- On the crew?
- Yes, but he's different from the other men.

12:32.400 --> 12:36.700
I mean, he was well-dressed
and self-assured.

12:36.810 --> 12:38.710
They treat him
like he was the boss.

12:38.810 --> 12:40.710
He even had his own tent
filled with food.

12:40.810 --> 12:44.110
Looks like you're imagining
a little more than just food.

12:44.210 --> 12:47.440
He invited me
to dine with him at the hotel.

12:47.550 --> 12:49.810
- He said "dine"?
- Yes.

12:49.920 --> 12:52.110
- What'd you say?
- I said yes.

14:00.420 --> 14:04.330
Pa, when you gonna let me do
the choppin' and you do the loadin'?

14:04.430 --> 14:08.960
- When you get older.
- That's what you said about the plowin'.

14:09.070 --> 14:13.530
Well, that's right. You're gonna be
a big help with the plowin' someday.

14:13.640 --> 14:17.500
- But I wanna help now.
- You are helping me.

14:17.610 --> 14:22.480
But I wanna do important work.
A man's work.

14:22.580 --> 14:25.840
There's all kinds of work, Son.

14:27.720 --> 14:29.690
There's a boy's work.

14:31.720 --> 14:35.820
There's a man's work,
and there's God's work.

14:35.930 --> 14:37.830
It's all important.

14:37.930 --> 14:41.190
- So feeding the chickens is important?
- Yep.

14:41.300 --> 14:43.860
- And cleaning the pig's pen?
- Oh, you bet.

14:43.970 --> 14:45.900
Um, Pa, I gotta go.

14:47.840 --> 14:52.710
- Go ahead.
- Be right back, Pa. Be right back to help.

14:52.810 --> 14:55.710
Okay.

14:56.780 --> 14:58.750
Whew.

15:12.100 --> 15:14.030
Aaron.

15:17.200 --> 15:19.530
Aaron, are you hurt?

15:19.640 --> 15:21.900
Seen 'em trapped
lots of times, Pa...

15:22.000 --> 15:25.870
but I ain't never heard
one do that till now.

15:34.350 --> 15:39.580
It scared me so bad, Pa.
I don't need to pee no more.

15:49.700 --> 15:51.630
You all right, Pa?

15:51.730 --> 15:54.640
Come here.

15:56.510 --> 15:58.500
Listen to me, Son.

15:58.610 --> 16:01.240
I need you to take off your belt...

16:01.340 --> 16:05.780
I need you to take off your belt
and wrap it around my leg.

16:09.850 --> 16:12.690
Oh. Come on.

16:16.560 --> 16:18.690
There you go.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.990
What do I do again, Pa?

16:21.100 --> 16:24.500
Wrap it around
above my knee. Tight.

16:24.600 --> 16:28.660
Pa, help me. I don't know what to do.

16:28.770 --> 16:32.210
It's not your fault.

16:34.040 --> 16:36.380
Pa.

16:39.720 --> 16:43.550
Pa.! Pa.!

16:45.760 --> 16:50.220
Please, Pa.

16:50.330 --> 16:52.620
Don't leave me.

16:55.730 --> 16:58.460
Please, Pa.

17:17.250 --> 17:20.220
Hyah.! Hyah.!

17:38.980 --> 17:41.600
Hyah.

17:46.480 --> 17:48.380
Hyah.

17:50.220 --> 17:53.020
Whoa. Whoa.

18:03.030 --> 18:04.930
Hello.

18:11.370 --> 18:13.710
Who are you?

18:13.810 --> 18:15.780
Hyah.

18:21.320 --> 18:23.910
Help him, Missie.

18:24.020 --> 18:29.650
Oh, my God. Ma-Mama!

18:32.700 --> 18:34.600
- Mama!
- What?

18:34.700 --> 18:36.670
Come quick.

18:38.770 --> 18:41.600
Oh, God. Oh, God.

18:46.380 --> 18:49.830
The bleeding has stopped for now.

18:49.950 --> 18:53.750
No moving around, Clark.
Uh-uh.

18:55.690 --> 19:00.920
Need to give that wound
a chance to heal.

19:01.020 --> 19:06.290
- For how long?
- At least a few weeks. Maybe more.

19:06.400 --> 19:11.660
That's a serious injury.
Gash goes clear to the bone.

19:13.170 --> 19:15.160
I'll see you out.

19:15.270 --> 19:17.540
Thanks, Doc.

19:21.040 --> 19:24.340
- How's Pa?
- He's resting.

19:26.480 --> 19:28.950
Thank you
for coming so quickly.

19:29.050 --> 19:31.820
It takes me a better part
of a month to do my rounds...

19:31.920 --> 19:34.650
but I'll be back
to check on him then.

19:34.760 --> 19:36.730
I'll make sure
he stays in bed.

19:36.830 --> 19:39.850
Infection.
That's your biggest worry now.

19:39.960 --> 19:43.520
A bad infection
could lead to gangrene.

19:43.630 --> 19:45.620
He could lose his leg.

19:47.270 --> 19:49.860
Or worse.

20:10.760 --> 20:15.220
Dear Lord,
you've healed the lame.

20:15.330 --> 20:17.490
Please.

20:17.600 --> 20:20.430
Please help this good man.

20:20.540 --> 20:22.500
Give us the strength
to endure this.

20:22.610 --> 20:28.410
He will.

20:28.510 --> 20:31.240
He will.

20:31.350 --> 20:35.510
That look of worry on your face,
it hurts a lot more than this leg does.

20:35.620 --> 20:37.590
I'm fine.

20:37.690 --> 20:40.590
I'm right here.

20:40.690 --> 20:43.450
I know, but...

20:43.560 --> 20:46.720
I'm right here, Marty.
I'm not going anywhere.

20:50.230 --> 20:54.190
And I'm figuring that, uh...

20:54.300 --> 20:57.360
A couple of days,
I'm gonna be right as rain.

20:59.910 --> 21:01.810
You can't work the fields, Clark.

21:01.910 --> 21:05.400
I have to.

21:05.510 --> 21:10.320
If we don't get a good crop this year,
we're gonna lose everything.

21:10.420 --> 21:14.050
I know.

21:14.160 --> 21:16.590
That's why Missie and I
will do it.

21:18.130 --> 21:20.930
You can't.

21:21.030 --> 21:23.230
We will.

21:51.930 --> 21:54.020
Shh.

21:55.300 --> 21:57.600
Pa's asleep.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.470
Go on and eat your lunch.

22:01.570 --> 22:06.030
- I wanna stay here with Pa.
- I'll be right here with him.

22:06.140 --> 22:08.610
Pa needs me.

22:53.860 --> 22:55.760
Whoa.

24:25.380 --> 24:28.180
- Thank you.
- Here you go, sir.

24:28.280 --> 24:31.410
- Mm-hmm. Thank you.
- Looks good.

24:52.070 --> 24:53.840
Whoa.

25:12.330 --> 25:15.960
Lunchtime.

25:18.000 --> 25:23.060
Oh, no. Saturday.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.260
What is it?
What's wrong?

25:52.370 --> 25:57.000
I'm just redressing the wound.
Can you hand me that canister of yeast?

26:02.480 --> 26:04.340
Elm bark and yeast?

26:26.400 --> 26:31.200
This should make it all better.

26:31.310 --> 26:33.430
And if it doesn't?

26:54.460 --> 26:58.090
Oh, God. Please, God.
Help my pa.

27:16.080 --> 27:18.210
Whoa. Whoa.

27:28.430 --> 27:32.800
Afternoon.
I think this belongs to you.

27:34.670 --> 27:37.040
You're the man
that helped bring my pa home.

27:37.140 --> 27:40.040
How is he?

27:40.140 --> 27:43.770
He's alive.

27:43.880 --> 27:45.850
How did you
happen upon him?

27:45.950 --> 27:49.980
I was out checking my traps.

27:52.520 --> 27:55.650
What do you think
you're doing?

27:55.760 --> 27:58.690
I thought I might
have a turn at the plow.

27:58.790 --> 28:02.890
Why are you helping me?

28:03.000 --> 28:04.900
Well, wait a minute.
What's your name?

28:05.000 --> 28:07.560
Nate.

28:07.670 --> 28:10.040
I thought maybe
we'd met before.

28:10.140 --> 28:12.040
I don't think so.

28:21.620 --> 28:26.710
Got, uh, Anders and Malone working
on the next quarter-mile like you asked.

28:26.820 --> 28:29.990
I'm glad someone
is where they're supposed to be.

28:30.090 --> 28:32.060
Yeah. I know it's
none of my business, boss...

28:32.160 --> 28:35.190
but maybe the lady had a good reason
for standing you up.

28:51.610 --> 28:55.380
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

28:59.350 --> 29:03.880
- So, you've handled a plow before.
- Yep.

29:03.990 --> 29:07.020
Are you from around here?

29:09.230 --> 29:12.460
- Here and there.
- Just passing through?

29:12.570 --> 29:15.560
You always ask
so many questions?

29:15.670 --> 29:18.070
Just wondering
on your work experience.

29:18.170 --> 29:21.970
'Cause it seems to me you should be
spacing the rows a little closer together.

29:22.080 --> 29:25.710
Because the more rows you plow, the more seeds
I can plant and the bigger the harvest is.

29:25.810 --> 29:29.440
Do I tell you how to
braid your hair?

29:29.550 --> 29:31.820
Don't tell me
how to plow a field.

29:48.700 --> 29:51.760
How is he, ma'am?

30:06.690 --> 30:09.990
Mind if I take a look?

30:12.190 --> 30:15.160
There's some water in the bowl.
Missie, could you...

30:28.540 --> 30:30.510
Best if your boy
wasn't in here.

30:30.610 --> 30:33.810
Aaron, Pa needs fresh water.

30:33.920 --> 30:37.650
- Missie can.
- No, I want you to get it.

30:37.750 --> 30:41.620
No, Mama.
I'm not leaving Pa.

30:41.720 --> 30:44.520
Pa will be all right.
We're here to see to that.

30:44.630 --> 30:46.650
- Right now I want you to...
- I'm not going! No!

30:46.760 --> 30:48.660
- Aaron.
- No.

30:48.760 --> 30:51.730
- Go and get fresh water.
- I'm not leaving.

30:51.830 --> 30:53.560
- Pa needs me.!
- Hand me that chair.

30:53.670 --> 30:57.160
Let me in.!

30:57.270 --> 31:01.140
He needs me in there, Mama.
Let me in.

31:01.240 --> 31:04.410
Please, let me in.

31:04.510 --> 31:07.140
What didn't you want him
to hear?

31:07.250 --> 31:10.550
We're gonna have to open that wound
and burn it clean.

31:10.650 --> 31:12.550
It's the only way
to get rid of the infection.

31:12.650 --> 31:16.220
- I thought the elm bark would help dry it out.
- Mama, please.

31:16.320 --> 31:19.620
He'll lose his leg...

31:19.730 --> 31:22.200
or his life if you let
the infection get worse.

31:22.300 --> 31:26.430
No. You're not touching my pa.

31:26.540 --> 31:30.490
Have you ever done
this sort of thing before?

31:30.610 --> 31:35.570
Been a ranch hand for years.
Seen a lot of mishaps.

31:35.680 --> 31:37.940
So I've taken care
of my share of accidents.

31:40.150 --> 31:44.350
Mama. Can't we just
wait for Doc?

31:44.450 --> 31:47.850
The doc won't be around
for another three weeks.

31:54.030 --> 31:57.120
What do you need?

32:00.170 --> 32:04.470
Take my knife and clean it
with whatever you got. Brandy or iodine.

32:04.570 --> 32:06.870
I'm gonna need
some hot coals and a fry pan.

32:17.420 --> 32:21.150
Be best if you took
your brothers out of earshot.

32:28.200 --> 32:30.560
I love you, Pa.

33:27.120 --> 33:29.390
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.

33:48.940 --> 33:51.240
Appreciate it.

34:20.810 --> 34:24.110
The fever broke.
He's awake.

34:24.210 --> 34:26.510
He's even hungry.
He's asking for my fried chicken.

34:39.690 --> 34:42.360
Make sure you thank him
and invite him for supper tonight.

34:42.460 --> 34:45.760
I will. Nate.

34:48.170 --> 34:50.969
Whoa. Whoa.
Whoa. Whoa.

34:53.580 --> 34:57.200
Thank you... for everything.

34:59.920 --> 35:02.820
Just glad I was there.

35:02.920 --> 35:05.550
Especially wouldn't wantin'
your brother watching his pa die...

35:05.650 --> 35:08.750
then living a life wondering
what he could've done different.

35:10.230 --> 35:12.520
Well, I hope you like fried chicken.

35:12.630 --> 35:15.760
That's what
we're having for supper.

35:23.770 --> 35:27.730
I'm hungry.
You hear my stomach growl here?

35:27.840 --> 35:29.970
We're all hungry.
We've been waiting all day.

35:30.080 --> 35:32.710
So who cooked this fine feast anyway?

35:32.810 --> 35:34.940
- Who do you think cooked it?
- Come on. Who cooked it?

35:35.050 --> 35:39.010
- I cooked it of course.
- Who put the on this chicken?

35:39.120 --> 35:42.280
- The what?
- It's my favorite.

35:44.960 --> 35:47.790
He's here.
Can we start eating?

35:47.900 --> 35:49.800
- Patience.
- Nate, come on in.

35:49.900 --> 35:52.330
We're having a picnic.
We made you a plate.

35:52.430 --> 35:55.230
Pa's leg is getting better, Nate.

35:55.340 --> 35:59.360
And I'll be right here to make sure
you have everything you need, Pa.

35:59.470 --> 36:04.500
Like if you need water... or biscuits.
Or someone to get you a piece of ham.

36:04.610 --> 36:09.950
- Or your Bible.
- How 'bout you get me some help with the chores?

36:10.050 --> 36:14.010
- Pa needs me.
- All right, you two. Let's say the blessing...

36:14.120 --> 36:18.580
so we can eat this fine meal
that your mama has prepared.

36:18.690 --> 36:24.330
Lord, we thank you for the blessings
that you've bestowed on this family.

36:24.430 --> 36:27.730
My family. And to Nate...

36:27.840 --> 36:31.290
our very own miracle...

36:31.410 --> 36:34.340
who has reopened our eyes
to your enduring promise.

36:34.440 --> 36:37.000
- Amen.
- Amen.

36:37.110 --> 36:39.010
- Eat up.
- All right.

36:39.110 --> 36:41.240
Oh.

36:41.350 --> 36:44.580
Marty tells me that you've done
more work in that field today...

36:44.690 --> 36:46.810
than she and Missie
have been able to do all week.

36:48.860 --> 36:51.660
Well, it wasn't
my first time behind a plow.

36:51.760 --> 36:53.750
You got your own
piece of land?

36:53.860 --> 36:59.560
Uh, no. No land yet.
Just plans.

36:59.670 --> 37:03.100
Never despise meager beginnings.

37:08.280 --> 37:12.240
Got some wheat and corn...

37:12.350 --> 37:16.980
needs to get in the ground...
next couple of weeks.

37:17.090 --> 37:20.080
I'll pay you fair price
soon as the crop comes in.

37:20.190 --> 37:22.090
But Missie here,
she's young and able...

37:22.190 --> 37:26.960
and I'm sure she'd be happy to
help you with the planting.

37:33.500 --> 37:35.730
I'll be out there at sunup.

37:35.840 --> 37:37.700
All right.

37:43.750 --> 37:46.210
Do a bunny.

37:48.250 --> 37:52.880
- He has a big mouth.
- You better watch out. He might get ya.

37:56.990 --> 38:00.120
What I won't give
for a handful of quiet.

38:00.230 --> 38:04.430
Do a swan.

38:12.240 --> 38:14.940
Do a bear.

38:15.040 --> 38:18.670
- He has a big mouth.
- Better watch out. He might get ya!

38:50.880 --> 38:52.810
Cut your hair for two bits.

38:52.910 --> 38:56.040
Actually, I'm not here for a haircut.
I just need a little information.

38:56.150 --> 38:58.210
Information's two bits.

39:00.920 --> 39:03.320
I'm looking for a young woman...
a Missie Davis.

39:03.420 --> 39:05.220
I can tell you just where
to find the Davis place.

39:05.330 --> 39:07.560
I'd be most appreciative.

39:07.660 --> 39:11.530
You wanna head back out of town.
Go south from the post office.

39:11.630 --> 39:15.090
- Get to two big oak trees. Head west.
- Head west.

39:15.200 --> 39:17.800
- You can't miss it.
- Thank you very much.

39:17.910 --> 39:20.530
Sometimes when
I'm outside like this...

39:20.640 --> 39:23.440
surrounded by all this beauty...

39:23.550 --> 39:26.910
it feels like I'm walking through
one of God's paintings.

39:27.020 --> 39:29.250
Feeds my soul.

39:30.620 --> 39:32.750
Speaking of God...

39:32.850 --> 39:36.650
what did your Pa mean by
"His enduring promise"?

39:36.760 --> 39:40.350
That someday
he'll wipe away all our tears...

39:40.460 --> 39:46.200
and that all pain and suffering
and heartache will be gone.

39:46.300 --> 39:49.270
That evening when
we were all together...

39:49.370 --> 39:53.170
feeling joyful that Pa
wasn't in pain...

39:53.270 --> 39:56.180
you helped give us
a glimpse of that promise.

40:11.990 --> 40:14.430
We have plenty of wood
back at the cabin.

40:14.530 --> 40:17.590
Not a sturdy piece of oak
like this one.

40:17.700 --> 40:20.170
What's it for?

40:23.000 --> 40:27.100
None of your beeswax.

40:31.650 --> 40:34.210
Are you all right?

40:43.660 --> 40:46.250
Crazy.

40:51.200 --> 40:53.060
You're foolish
to mess with bees.

40:53.170 --> 40:56.140
I've done this
plenty of times.

40:56.240 --> 40:58.140
Smoke puts 'em to sleep.

41:00.940 --> 41:03.310
We'll surprise your mama
with some honey.

41:09.250 --> 41:11.450
Ouch. Hey, ouch!

41:11.550 --> 41:14.580
What's the matter?
One of the bees not sleepy?

41:23.730 --> 41:26.670
What about the honey for Mama?

41:26.770 --> 41:31.430
I'd, uh, stop talking
and start running if I were you.

41:33.470 --> 41:36.770
Oh.

41:46.390 --> 41:50.220
Come here.

42:03.300 --> 42:05.170
That was close.

42:05.270 --> 42:08.240
Smoke puts 'em to sleep.

42:08.340 --> 42:13.140
- It's always worked before.
- Well, throwing a rock at 'em didn't help either.

42:17.020 --> 42:19.650
No. Oh, no.

42:19.750 --> 42:22.310
- What is it?
- My locket.

42:23.690 --> 42:25.890
- It's gone... It can't be gone.
- Missie.

42:31.700 --> 42:34.220
My mama gave it to me.

42:42.440 --> 42:44.740
Come on.

42:52.220 --> 42:54.710
I can't believe it.

42:56.720 --> 42:58.690
Someone you know?

43:00.060 --> 43:03.030
Someone I never thought
I'd see again.

43:10.870 --> 43:13.500
Good afternoon, Missie.

43:14.980 --> 43:17.570
Good afternoon, Grant.

43:17.680 --> 43:20.080
I was worried when you didn't
show up at the restaurant.

43:20.180 --> 43:22.650
It took every bit of
my surveying equipment to find you.

43:22.750 --> 43:26.710
Actually, I hope you don't mind, but I took
the liberty of asking around in town.

43:26.820 --> 43:31.120
I had planned to be there.
My pa had an accident and was quite ill.

43:31.230 --> 43:34.680
- Is he all right?
- He's still recovering...

43:34.800 --> 43:36.890
but I think the worst
is behind him.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.360
Well, I'm so glad.

43:41.440 --> 43:46.140
This is Nate. He's been working
for my pa since his accident.

43:46.240 --> 43:49.070
This is Grant Thomas.

43:49.180 --> 43:54.480
We had a mishap with some bees.
I'm a mess.

43:54.580 --> 43:57.570
A beautiful mess.
If you don't mind my saying so.

43:59.290 --> 44:01.980
Would you like to meet my folks?
I mean, my pa might be sleeping, but...

44:02.090 --> 44:04.720
Well, I don't wanna disturb them
with this unannounced visit.

44:04.830 --> 44:08.690
But if it's all right, I'd like to come back and
do things the right and proper way.

44:08.800 --> 44:11.420
- Things?
- Yes.

44:11.530 --> 44:14.970
I'd like to ask his permission to court
his daughter, if that's all right with you?

44:15.070 --> 44:19.840
Yes. That would be fine
with me.

44:19.940 --> 44:23.740
Then I'll look forward to my next conversation
with him when he's feeling up to it.

44:23.850 --> 44:26.780
It's nice to meet you, Nate.

44:32.420 --> 44:34.120
I'll see you soon.

44:36.590 --> 44:38.890
All right, John.

45:36.620 --> 45:39.020
Mama sent me to get you.
She's got supper ready.

45:40.720 --> 45:43.710
I'm not real hungry.

45:43.820 --> 45:47.780
- But thank her for me anyway.
- All right.

45:47.900 --> 45:50.520
- I could bring you something for later.
- No.

45:52.570 --> 45:56.090
But you, uh... you can do
something for me.

45:57.670 --> 46:01.570
Give this to your pa.
He's gonna need it to get around.

46:04.450 --> 46:07.070
A sturdy piece of oak.

46:08.950 --> 46:10.980
I know how much
he'll appreciate it.

46:12.390 --> 46:14.320
Good night.

46:27.870 --> 46:30.500
Whoa. Whoa.

46:31.740 --> 46:33.640
Good to see you up.

46:33.740 --> 46:37.540
I just wanted to thank you
for making this fancy cane for me.

46:37.650 --> 46:42.410
- Mighty thoughtful of you.
- I know what a chore it can be to get around at first.

46:42.520 --> 46:45.010
You had some experience
with a bum leg yourself?

46:45.120 --> 46:49.520
My pa.
He needed a cane for months.

46:50.730 --> 46:52.590
Best if I get
the horses brushed and fed.

46:52.690 --> 46:54.460
All right then.

48:20.950 --> 48:23.080
How was your walk?

48:23.180 --> 48:26.450
Felt good to get out for a while.
Thanks to you.

48:26.550 --> 48:30.120
I went back to that spot in the woods
where I had my accident.

48:30.220 --> 48:32.350
Woods are nice and green
this time of year.

48:32.460 --> 48:37.860
Yep. Fella could get lost
in those trees if he wanted to.

48:37.970 --> 48:40.800
Willie.

48:44.970 --> 48:46.910
How long have you known?

48:47.010 --> 48:50.640
Boy does a lot of growing and changing
in his teen years.

48:50.750 --> 48:56.050
When you told me about your pa's leg,
well, that kind of confirmed it for me.

49:00.420 --> 49:05.590
My middle name's Nathan.
Nate.

49:05.690 --> 49:10.390
Been using it for years 'cause I thought if
I changed my name I could change my past.

49:10.500 --> 49:12.970
Hmm.

49:13.070 --> 49:15.060
How's that
working out for you, son?

49:17.270 --> 49:22.570
Most days it seems like
the past is breathing down my neck...

49:22.680 --> 49:25.300
reminding me I'm Willie.

49:25.410 --> 49:28.870
Even in a roomful of folks
who call me Nate.

49:28.980 --> 49:31.510
Your family
had a lot to deal with...

49:34.260 --> 49:36.520
and it must've been awful hard.

49:39.390 --> 49:41.490
When a tragedy...

49:43.200 --> 49:46.000
happens...

49:46.100 --> 49:48.090
a real family pulls together.

49:48.200 --> 49:50.670
I mean, mine ripped apart.

49:53.470 --> 49:57.430
My ma, she...

49:57.550 --> 50:01.680
grieved herself crazy,
and she went back East.

50:02.980 --> 50:07.610
My pa, he just quit.
So I left home six years ago.

50:09.660 --> 50:13.220
I imagine you got your reasons
for coming back now.

50:13.330 --> 50:16.300
I got some things
that need to be said.

50:19.670 --> 50:24.130
Then I came close to going home,
and I couldn't face my pa.

50:28.010 --> 50:30.640
Not after I left like I did.

50:30.740 --> 50:35.370
And then you found...
Aaron and me.

50:37.250 --> 50:40.080
Yes, you did.

50:40.190 --> 50:43.650
I saw your pa today, son.

50:43.760 --> 50:48.220
I don't know what happened
between you two.

50:48.330 --> 50:52.200
I do know you're never going to step out of
the shadow of your past until you see him.

51:04.580 --> 51:06.440
Did you...
Did you tell him about me?

51:06.550 --> 51:08.740
That's not up to me.

51:08.850 --> 51:11.370
He probably doesn't even
wanna see me.

51:11.490 --> 51:16.790
I saw a man
with a face full of regret.

51:19.490 --> 51:23.620
Seeing you.
Talking to you.

51:23.730 --> 51:27.430
That might help him
put his past to rest.

51:30.800 --> 51:33.400
I suppose you think I'm a coward
for running the way I did.

51:33.510 --> 51:37.440
The way a man grieves,
that's a personal thing.

51:38.810 --> 51:41.040
But I do know
there are times...

51:41.150 --> 51:46.610
when a man can be driven
to take a trip in search of answers.

51:46.720 --> 51:49.780
And if that man doesn't find
the answer he's looking for?

51:49.890 --> 51:55.350
Most often we're not looking for answers.
We're in need of comfort.

51:57.400 --> 52:02.530
And for me, the only trip worth taking
is when I kneel to pray.

52:04.910 --> 52:08.310
All the comfort I could ever ask for
is right there.

52:08.410 --> 52:11.040
In God.

52:13.280 --> 52:15.310
You'll be fine, son.

52:31.930 --> 52:35.330
Oh, yes. Of course.

53:27.420 --> 53:29.320
What's your business here?

53:30.360 --> 53:32.480
Pa, it's me, Willie.

53:44.200 --> 53:46.100
Oh, my.

53:46.210 --> 53:49.510
I guess you would be old enough
to have whiskers by now.

53:49.610 --> 53:51.510
Yes, sir.

54:01.720 --> 54:03.880
I'm gonna make some coffee.
You want a cup?

54:06.530 --> 54:09.090
Coffee would be good.

54:09.200 --> 54:11.160
Maybe I'll fix some eggs.

54:19.540 --> 54:22.530
I found your parents to be
very gracious about our lunch together.

54:22.640 --> 54:26.440
Back East, young women must often
be accompanied by a chaperone.

54:26.550 --> 54:29.610
Mothers and sisters are too busy
with their tasks of the day...

54:29.720 --> 54:31.620
to spend time chaperoning.

54:31.720 --> 54:35.450
If you don't mind
my saying so, Mr. Thomas...

54:35.560 --> 54:37.820
the entire town is very happy...

54:37.930 --> 54:41.330
that your family's bringing the railroad
right past our doors.

54:41.430 --> 54:43.830
Glad to hear we have the support
of the community.

54:43.930 --> 54:48.830
Oh, um, the cook is preparing that special
chicken dish that you requested.

54:48.940 --> 54:52.130
Well, whenever you're ready
for your first course, just signal me.

54:52.240 --> 54:55.570
- Very good.
- I thought you were a surveyor.

54:55.680 --> 54:58.580
I am. When your family
owns the business...

54:58.680 --> 55:01.150
it's only smart to know
every aspect of it.

55:01.250 --> 55:03.270
I hope you find everything
to your satisfaction.

55:03.380 --> 55:06.510
Well, everything's so lovely...

55:06.620 --> 55:10.610
the table linens, the crystal,
the beautiful Aubusson china.

55:10.720 --> 55:13.450
- You know the pattern?
- Her Majesty's Filigree.

55:13.560 --> 55:16.960
See, the scroll designs along the rim
give it elegance...

55:17.060 --> 55:19.330
and the raised accents
make it unique.

55:21.240 --> 55:23.760
I spend an exorbitant
amount of time reading.

55:23.870 --> 55:26.530
Hey! Hey!

55:26.640 --> 55:30.840
- I believe that's our lunch.
- Pardon. Sorry, sir.

55:33.810 --> 55:35.710
Excuse me.

55:35.820 --> 55:38.150
I'm terribly sorry.

55:39.820 --> 55:43.280
Here you go, sir.

55:43.390 --> 55:45.690
Thank you.

55:50.800 --> 55:54.060
- A connoisseur of knowledge
and a chicken-wrangler.

55:54.170 --> 55:57.730
The advantage of being raised in the West
and educated by a woman from the East.

55:58.940 --> 56:03.240
Um, my mother died
when I was just a child...

56:03.340 --> 56:07.250
and my father ended up
marrying a woman from the East.

56:09.120 --> 56:11.710
Oh, no!
Oh, I'm so clumsy.

56:11.820 --> 56:14.550
No, no. Not at all.
Missie. No, Missie.

56:14.660 --> 56:17.060
- I know they're expensive. I can pay him back.
- Missie. Missie.

56:17.160 --> 56:20.390
The crystal is mine...
as are the plates.

56:20.490 --> 56:23.730
They are easily replaced.
Now sit.

56:23.830 --> 56:28.030
- They're yours?
- I wanted the table to be perfect...

56:28.140 --> 56:30.330
so I had my man, John,
bring them over this morning.

56:30.440 --> 56:34.370
Don't worry another moment. I have 20 more
crystal glasses just like that one at home.

56:34.470 --> 56:36.770
- Twenty more.
- Yes.

56:36.880 --> 56:39.540
And I would happily let you
crack each and every one...

56:39.650 --> 56:41.640
if you'll dine with me
20 more times.

56:43.380 --> 56:45.910
Maybe next time we'll have
to have a picnic instead.

56:46.020 --> 56:48.080
You can leave
all your crystal at home.

56:48.190 --> 56:50.420
I'm already
planning the menu.

56:56.130 --> 56:59.900
This is potatoes
with scrambled eggs.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.370
Just like you always
used to have.

57:02.470 --> 57:05.060
Oh, that wasn't me.
That was Matt...

57:05.170 --> 57:08.070
Mattie.

57:08.180 --> 57:10.440
I hate to waste good food.

57:10.540 --> 57:12.770
You know, Pa,
I could probably eat some of this.

57:12.880 --> 57:14.870
Just don't do me
any favors, Willie.

57:14.980 --> 57:18.110
It ain't gonna break my heart
if you don't eat the eggs.

57:18.220 --> 57:20.650
Really, Pa,
I could eat some of that.

57:20.750 --> 57:24.350
Well, you're gonna
eat nothin' now.

57:24.460 --> 57:27.020
I mean, six years since
I seen or heard from you.

57:27.130 --> 57:29.890
I guess I'm entitled
to forget a few things.

57:30.000 --> 57:31.900
Oh, Pa.

57:34.030 --> 57:36.090
I'm sorry I left like I did.

57:36.200 --> 57:39.660
Well, at least your ma
had the guts...

57:39.770 --> 57:42.000
to tell me to my face
she was leavin'.

57:44.880 --> 57:48.140
- You know what happened to her?
- No.

57:50.050 --> 57:52.480
Then I guess
you're a lot like your mama.

57:55.620 --> 57:58.750
Well, I'm here now.

57:58.860 --> 58:01.490
I came back
to set things right.

58:01.600 --> 58:05.000
- I hope you could...
- What can I do? I could pretend none of this ever happened?

58:05.100 --> 58:07.070
I'm not asking you
to pretend nothin', Pa.

58:07.170 --> 58:10.190
- I'm asking you to forgive me.
- You want me to forgive you?

58:17.440 --> 58:20.440
Maybe you should forget
you still have a son.

58:58.150 --> 59:02.210
- Yes. We'll take three of those, okay?
- Yes.

59:02.320 --> 59:04.220
Yes, please.

59:08.200 --> 59:10.560
That will be fine.

59:14.370 --> 59:16.960
We'll try these ones.

59:19.940 --> 59:22.370
My goodness.

59:22.480 --> 59:26.410
You make him sound like a fictional hero
from one of your novels.

59:26.510 --> 59:31.380
Grant is educated...
and handsome...

59:31.490 --> 59:33.450
attentive.

59:35.160 --> 59:37.060
He's traveled all over
for his job...

59:37.160 --> 59:39.650
and seen places
I've only read about.

59:39.760 --> 59:42.290
Just remember...

59:42.400 --> 59:45.090
that God has written
his own story for you.

59:45.200 --> 59:48.170
And it's not the feelings of your heart
that it should be based upon...

59:48.270 --> 59:52.530
but... rather the thoughts of your heart
that you need to hear...

59:52.640 --> 59:55.570
that inner voice
that tells you...

59:55.680 --> 59:58.040
that this man will care for you
no matter what...

59:58.150 --> 01:00:01.910
that he'll still want to kiss you
when you're old and gray...

01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:06.380
tend to you when you're sick,
honor you.

01:00:06.490 --> 01:00:11.050
And if the thoughts of my heart say yes,
he is the one?

01:00:13.930 --> 01:00:17.060
Then you should trust your instincts
and pledge your heart to him...

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:19.630
because a man like that
is as rare as a diamond in the rough.

01:00:19.730 --> 01:00:21.890
Like Pa.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.600
Yes. Like your pa.

01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:33.270
Aaron said he saw you
packin' up your horse.

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:35.280
You plannin'
on goin' somewhere?

01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:38.720
Took your advice.
I saw my pa.

01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:40.790
I figured
that's where you were.

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:47.260
According to him,
I ruined his life.

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:51.390
I'm sorry that it didn't work out
the way you hoped, Willie.

01:00:53.470 --> 01:00:56.490
I really thought your father was ready
to make amends with you.

01:00:58.270 --> 01:01:00.800
He'll never be ready
to do that.

01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:03.500
He'll never forgive me.

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:08.510
You're his son.

01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:10.710
Not anymore.

01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:12.810
You wanna talk about it?

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:16.410
Talkin' about it
don't change anything.

01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:22.190
Sometimes,
just talkin' it through...

01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:25.590
it'll help you see things
in a whole different light.

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:31.700
There ain't no light in the world
that'd make this better.

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:40.170
Can't hurt to try.

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:43.740
Unless you're afraid.

01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:50.690
I used to set traps for Pa.

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:56.760
Mattie was always after me
to let him come along.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:01.520
I didn't want him to.
I just figured he'd slow me down.

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:05.930
I didn't want him to.

01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:08.010
I just figured
he'd get in the way.

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:13.410
But Mattie had a way
about him.

01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:18.580
He knew just how to get Ma and Pa
to let him have his way.

01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:23.550
When are we gonna
set the first trap, Willie?

01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:26.150
When I find the right place.

01:02:28.930 --> 01:02:32.190
- When are we gonna eat the food Mama sent?
- When we get hungry.

01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:34.890
How do you know when
it's the right time for the traps?

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.770
Can't you hush up
for just two seconds?

01:02:37.870 --> 01:02:40.740
I can't concentrate
with you yammering on and on.

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:44.610
I don't know how I lost track of the day.

01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:47.180
Guess I was just so intent...

01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:50.270
on gettin' those traps...
set so Pa would know...

01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:53.280
what a good trapper
I really was.

01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:55.750
Thinkin' back,
I don't know how I couldn't see...

01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:58.150
how tired and worried
Mattie was.

01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:01.590
I'm cold, and it's getting dark.

01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:03.660
Don't you think
we'd better head back?

01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:06.200
I got one more trap to set.

01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:11.600
Mama's gonna be worried.

01:03:11.710 --> 01:03:15.330
Hush. Gotta make
this last trap count.

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:18.470
Pa's dependin' on me.

01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:21.050
It was like a curtain dropped over the sun.

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:25.280
One minute, I could see
where I was goin'...

01:03:25.390 --> 01:03:27.820
and the next minute
it got so dark...

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:30.520
I couldn't make out
the right way to go.

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:41.160
I'm so sorry, Mattie.
I should have listened to you.

01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:44.330
There's no way I can
get us home in the dark.

01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:49.770
May-Maybe Pa
will come find us.

01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:55.280
Maybe. More than likely,
we'll just have to wait out the night...

01:03:55.380 --> 01:03:57.350
set out home at first light.

01:03:57.450 --> 01:04:00.350
I'm awful cold, Willie.

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:06.460
Here. Stay close to me,
and I'll...

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:09.790
I'll keep you wa-warm.

01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:12.800
Thanks, Willie.

01:04:22.210 --> 01:04:24.640
"Thanks, Willie. "

01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:28.980
The kid was shiverin' and shaking
in the cold, and he says thanks.

01:04:33.150 --> 01:04:35.550
Then what happened?

01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:37.620
Then...

01:04:39.290 --> 01:04:41.260
Then he, uh...

01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:46.370
You know.

01:04:46.470 --> 01:04:48.870
I was right.

01:04:48.970 --> 01:04:51.840
Talkin' about it
doesn't change anything.

01:05:02.250 --> 01:05:04.720
Plowin's about done.

01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:06.720
I think it's time I moved on.

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:09.880
- I did what I came for.
- Did you?

01:05:11.890 --> 01:05:14.660
Came home, saw my pa.

01:05:16.130 --> 01:05:19.720
Are you sure that's who
you really needed to face?

01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:25.100
I should be on my way.

01:05:25.210 --> 01:05:28.540
Our doors will always
be open to you, Willie...

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:30.540
and our prayers
will be with you.

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:59.170
Hah.

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:02.140
Hah.

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:07.810
Hah.

01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:12.280
Hah.

01:07:46.380 --> 01:07:48.350
Mattie, wake up.

01:07:52.490 --> 01:07:54.720
Come on, Mattie.
Quit foolin'.

01:07:56.220 --> 01:07:58.520
Mattie?

01:07:58.630 --> 01:08:00.790
No. Mattie.

01:08:00.890 --> 01:08:02.860
Mattie, come on.

01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:06.530
Come on, Mattie.
Wake up. No.

01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:10.070
No.! Mattie.!

01:08:10.170 --> 01:08:12.690
Mattie!

01:08:12.810 --> 01:08:15.240
Mattie! No!

01:08:16.810 --> 01:08:19.569
Mattie.

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:24.080
No. Mattie.

01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:27.279
Mattie.

01:08:30.359 --> 01:08:33.380
It was my fault, Mattie.

01:08:37.529 --> 01:08:40.290
I was supposed to protect you,
and I didn't.

01:08:44.399 --> 01:08:47.130
I didn't want it to happen.

01:08:49.939 --> 01:08:52.640
You slipped away,
and I didn't even know.

01:08:55.979 --> 01:08:59.080
You were so brave,
and I didn't even get to tell you.

01:09:06.029 --> 01:09:08.149
I'm sorry, Mattie.

01:09:12.770 --> 01:09:14.790
Please forgive me.

01:09:33.649 --> 01:09:35.810
- After you.
- Thank you.

01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:47.000
Grant.

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:49.160
I've never seen anything like it.

01:09:49.270 --> 01:09:51.760
It's just like a real home.

01:09:53.010 --> 01:09:55.340
It is my home.

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:58.140
The tent goes up
wherever I am.

01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:00.210
I don't see any purpose
in depriving myself...

01:10:00.310 --> 01:10:02.710
of the comforts
I've become accustomed to.

01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:07.220
You travel
with all these books?

01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:10.850
Books... and music.

01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:18.360
Honor me with a dance.

01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:27.510
- You're an excellent partner.
- Thank you. My father taught me.

01:10:27.610 --> 01:10:30.630
Missie, I...

01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:34.040
I'm not generally a man who thinks much
past the next site I'm working...

01:10:34.150 --> 01:10:38.880
but, since we've met, I've found myself
daydreaming about a future with you.

01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:43.190
What do you see for us
in your dreams?

01:10:43.290 --> 01:10:48.250
Well, I see us traveling
and exploring together.

01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:52.630
Midnight picnics under a canopy
of the brightest stars...

01:10:52.730 --> 01:10:54.930
or dining in the finest hotels.

01:10:55.030 --> 01:10:58.400
A life brimming with anything
and everything you could ever want.

01:11:01.410 --> 01:11:04.270
That life sounds like
a fairy tale.

01:11:06.850 --> 01:11:09.470
That life could be ours.

01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:12.240
You would never have to
turn a spade in soil again or...

01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:14.720
or toil at planting
your own food.

01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:17.420
And if I did have
to plant and plow...

01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:19.920
do you see yourself
right there beside me?

01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:23.150
You're missing my point.
I wouldn't have to be there...

01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:25.230
because no wife of mine
would ever struggle...

01:11:25.330 --> 01:11:27.130
if even for an hour, in a field.

01:11:27.230 --> 01:11:29.330
I'm a very wealthy man.

01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:37.240
What's wrong?

01:11:39.250 --> 01:11:42.480
I just always thought my first kiss
should be for the man I marry.

01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:44.780
Then marry me.

01:11:47.250 --> 01:11:49.720
Missie, you don't want
to say no to a man...

01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:52.120
who's offering to save you
from a life of adversity.

01:11:52.230 --> 01:11:54.560
I'm saying no to a man
who doesn't think adversity...

01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:56.630
is something
to get through together.

01:11:56.730 --> 01:12:00.060
It's just not real, Grant.

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:05.140
I'll tell you what's real.

01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:08.140
You've just given up
the chance of a lifetime.

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:10.140
I can have any heart I want.

01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:13.140
Until now.

01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:18.120
I'm sorry, Grant.

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:22.550
I'll get someone
to take you home.

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:32.820
God bless you.

01:12:32.930 --> 01:12:35.530
Nate. Hi.

01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:41.230
Actually, I'm Willie...
Nathan LaHaye.

01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:46.510
- Willie LaHaye.
- You were the boy...

01:12:46.610 --> 01:12:50.140
that stole my hair ribbons
and dipped my braids in ink.

01:12:50.250 --> 01:12:52.650
And then when your brother...

01:12:56.890 --> 01:12:59.590
And then you were gone.

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:05.200
So, why didn't you tell me
who you were?

01:13:08.570 --> 01:13:11.040
I've been Nate for years
to strangers.

01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:15.040
Guess I wasn't ready
to be Willie again...

01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:17.040
un-until now.

01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:22.180
Well, you don't look
like anything I remember.

01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:26.010
Oh. I was just a boy
when I left.

01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:29.880
It's been a while.
People change.

01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:33.130
They do.

01:13:37.030 --> 01:13:40.090
Well, how about your Pa?
Have you seen him?

01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:45.200
I've seen him...

01:13:46.610 --> 01:13:49.370
but he's not ready
to see me.

01:13:57.980 --> 01:14:02.080
Well, you know, I wanted to thank you
for all you did for my family...

01:14:02.190 --> 01:14:06.420
but you... you left
without saying good-bye.

01:14:09.130 --> 01:14:12.760
Had some thinkin' to do,
some things to get right.

01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:18.460
I'm grateful to you
and your family...

01:14:18.570 --> 01:14:21.130
for helping me
put down a burden...

01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:23.140
that I've been carryin'
for a long time.

01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:27.370
Actually, I'm...
I'm headed for the West.

01:14:32.850 --> 01:14:34.820
You've got land to farm?

01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:40.120
No. Not yet.
When I do claim my land...

01:14:40.230 --> 01:14:44.600
it'll be for raising cattle,
not crops.

01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:48.600
I worked on a couple cattle ranches,
and it's what suits me.

01:14:53.210 --> 01:14:56.440
The thing is,
I came by today...

01:14:56.540 --> 01:14:58.510
because I didn't want
to make the same mistake.

01:15:01.150 --> 01:15:04.410
I wanted to see you
and, um...

01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:09.720
and give these back to you.

01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:18.490
My ribbons.

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:20.660
You kept them all these years?

01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:24.500
Probably seems silly to you.

01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:26.800
No, not silly.

01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:30.670
It's sweet.

01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:33.750
Well, anyway,
that's what I came for...

01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:36.840
to give you those and...

01:15:38.250 --> 01:15:41.650
to say good-bye.

01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:47.690
Bye.

01:16:06.650 --> 01:16:09.210
Never despise meager beginnings.

01:16:13.490 --> 01:16:15.510
Wait!

01:16:15.620 --> 01:16:17.520
Willie.

01:16:24.260 --> 01:16:27.390
Willie.

01:16:34.510 --> 01:16:38.640
I was just wondering
if, um...

01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:41.910
Are cattle ranchers tied to the seasons
the same way farmers are?

01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:46.110
No, not in the same way,
I suppose.

01:16:46.220 --> 01:16:49.920
So, would it make a difference
if you leave now or leave later?

01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:52.120
I guess not.

01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:55.630
After all the work you did
plowing and planting our fields...

01:16:55.730 --> 01:16:58.930
it would be a shame for you to miss
the harvest and not collect your pay.

01:16:59.030 --> 01:17:01.520
And I make really good
corn bread pudding...

01:17:01.630 --> 01:17:03.930
once the sweet corn's shucked.

01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:10.580
I'll bet that fella Grant Thomas
will really like that.

01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:16.000
Yes, I bet he will...

01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:18.480
if he finds someone
to make it for him.

01:17:20.350 --> 01:17:22.790
It won't be me.

01:17:25.260 --> 01:17:29.990
I guess I could postpone my trip
long enough to be here for the harvest.

01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:33.400
Good.

01:17:58.060 --> 01:18:00.180
They named him Big Earl.

01:18:00.290 --> 01:18:02.450
Big Earl, he...

01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:07.060
Dear Father, we thank you
for this harvest...

01:18:07.170 --> 01:18:09.070
for your faith in us...

01:18:09.170 --> 01:18:11.470
and for the time
we spend together.

01:18:11.570 --> 01:18:14.560
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:21.240
All right,
pass your bowls down.

01:18:30.690 --> 01:18:32.660
You workin' hard?

01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:34.660
Tryin' to.

01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:47.540
Go again.

01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:54.710
All right, you two.
You know what's expected.

01:18:54.810 --> 01:18:57.370
- Ah.
- Go ahead. Get on up there.

01:18:57.480 --> 01:18:59.680
Time's a-wastin', boy.

01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:04.280
Ah.!

01:19:18.970 --> 01:19:20.530
Look at them two.

01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:47.690
I love you, Missie Davis.

01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:52.230
I always have.

01:19:54.010 --> 01:19:55.910
I love you too.

01:19:58.780 --> 01:20:02.270
Missie Davis,
will you marry me?

01:20:35.150 --> 01:20:37.120
Happy day.

01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:13.210
- Try and send word as soon as you're settled.
- I will.

01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:21.370
And walk as much as you can.
It's better than riding.

01:22:23.820 --> 01:22:27.160
You know
how much we love you.

01:22:32.530 --> 01:22:35.630
I know it's not so far,
but send word once you're settled.

01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:43.600
I'll take good care of her.

01:22:43.710 --> 01:22:45.610
I know you will.

01:22:45.710 --> 01:22:48.440
You take good care
of both of you.

01:22:57.520 --> 01:22:59.990
Ever since you were
just a little baby...

01:23:01.430 --> 01:23:04.400
I knew this moment would come.

01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:08.930
You always had
an independent spirit.

01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:14.800
Pa. My heart's breaking.

01:23:14.910 --> 01:23:17.640
Mine too.

01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:23.480
- Can you fix it?
- Not this time, little one.

01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:30.690
Not this time.

01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:48.610
You go ahead now.

01:23:48.710 --> 01:23:51.010
Your husband's waitin' on you.

01:24:00.820 --> 01:24:02.720
Thank you.

01:24:36.290 --> 01:24:38.450
Remember His promise.

01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:50.660
No tears.
