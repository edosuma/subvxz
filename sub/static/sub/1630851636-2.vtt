WEBVTT

00:01.740 --> 00:04.265
Previously onBull...Where's Astrid?

00:04.395 --> 00:05.788
[sobbing]:
He took her! He had a gun!

00:05.918 --> 00:06.876
[distorted]: If you ever
want to see your daughter

00:07.007 --> 00:09.313
again, you'll pay $1 million.

00:09.444 --> 00:11.924
If you call police, she's dead.

00:12.055 --> 00:13.926
You need to find out everything
that you can about this woman.

00:14.057 --> 00:15.102
SHERYL:
We'll see how sorry
you are.

00:15.232 --> 00:17.017
This is for Simon.

00:17.147 --> 00:19.236
Drop your weapon!
Put your hands in the air!

00:26.287 --> 00:29.159
McDONNELL:
But the good news is,
our group got a grant

00:29.290 --> 00:30.856
to help survey
water systems upstate

00:30.987 --> 00:32.902
and look for lead pipe.Is there a lot?

00:33.033 --> 00:34.730
It feels like there
would be a lot.

00:34.860 --> 00:36.427
Actually...

00:36.558 --> 00:38.603
seven percent of water systems
nationwide are leaded.

00:38.734 --> 00:40.475
This is not working.

00:40.605 --> 00:42.129
What's the matter?

00:42.259 --> 00:44.218
The video said it was supposed
to thicken while it cooked,

00:44.348 --> 00:46.046
and it's... not.

00:46.176 --> 00:47.699
Mm.This is inedible.

00:47.830 --> 00:48.918
Yeah.
[laughs]

00:49.049 --> 00:50.615
We have to pull
the pizza rip cord.

00:50.746 --> 00:52.443
No problem. You know me--
no veggies, lots of meat.

00:52.574 --> 00:53.836
[pounding on door]

00:53.966 --> 00:55.925
MAN:
Jerry McDonnell!
This is the FBI!

00:56.056 --> 00:59.363
We have a warrant to search
the premises! Open the door!

01:03.106 --> 01:05.717
Jerry McDonnell?
Are you Jerry McDonnell?

01:05.848 --> 01:07.154
AGENT:
Check the bedroom.Yes.

01:07.284 --> 01:09.547
This authorizes us to search
for and remove items

01:09.678 --> 01:10.766
from these premises.

01:10.896 --> 01:12.202
If you interfere
or obstruct us,

01:12.333 --> 01:13.638
you will be arrested.

01:13.769 --> 01:14.683
What is this about?

01:14.813 --> 01:15.945
That's all the information

01:16.076 --> 01:17.903
I'm required to provide.

01:18.904 --> 01:19.862
Kelsey.

01:19.992 --> 01:21.211
We should get out of here.

01:21.342 --> 01:23.083
Really, let's just go.

01:24.214 --> 01:25.868
Jerry, my name is Anna Steadman.

01:25.998 --> 01:27.522
I'm a special agent
with the FBI.

01:28.523 --> 01:29.741
You're FBI?

01:29.872 --> 01:31.003
Yes, I am.

01:31.134 --> 01:32.962
[panting]:
Oh, my God.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.095
I think I'm gonna be sick.Jerry,

01:35.225 --> 01:36.400
I'm not supposed
to tell you this,

01:36.531 --> 01:37.401
but you're
about to get arrested.

01:37.532 --> 01:38.750
Don't try to run
or fight.

01:38.881 --> 01:39.969
You'll just,
you'll make it worse.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.449
You're in a lot
of trouble.

01:41.579 --> 01:43.103
More than you understand.
You need a lawyer.

01:43.233 --> 01:45.105
A good one.

01:45.235 --> 01:47.107
[siren wailing in distance]

01:50.458 --> 01:52.112
[passing siren wailing]

01:52.242 --> 01:53.722
[snorts]

01:53.852 --> 01:55.724
[sniffling]

01:55.854 --> 01:57.900
[panting]

02:05.516 --> 02:07.562
[chuckles]

02:08.650 --> 02:11.522
[whispers]:
Good morning.[grunts]

02:11.653 --> 02:13.698
Couldn't sleep.

02:13.829 --> 02:16.440
Tried and I couldn't do
it, so I came in here.

02:16.571 --> 02:18.486
Good idea.

02:20.227 --> 02:22.577
It just felt better
to be close to her.

02:22.707 --> 02:24.231
Call me crazy.

02:24.361 --> 02:25.928
Our daughter was just kidnapped,

02:26.058 --> 02:27.625
and we almost
didn't get her back.

02:27.756 --> 02:30.150
I'd say you were crazy
if you did anything else.

02:30.280 --> 02:31.673
Flatterer.

02:31.803 --> 02:33.240
[chuckles softly]

02:33.370 --> 02:36.417
I think I'm just
gonna stay in today and just...

02:36.547 --> 02:38.332
be with Astrid.

02:39.333 --> 02:41.204
Good idea.

02:43.424 --> 02:45.556
I think I'm gonna go
into the office.

02:47.123 --> 02:48.516
Already?

02:48.646 --> 02:50.648
Yeah. Just want to see
how things are going.

02:50.779 --> 02:53.695
But I thought we were gonna take
some time to rest and recover.

02:53.825 --> 02:55.392
We did.

02:55.523 --> 02:56.611
Two days.

02:56.741 --> 02:59.266
Rested. Recovered.

03:00.789 --> 03:02.138
[sighs]

03:04.140 --> 03:06.360
I'm gonna go get dressed.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.102
[sighs]

03:12.844 --> 03:14.368
[bell dings]

03:19.851 --> 03:22.202
I thought you were gonna
stay home for a while.

03:22.332 --> 03:23.594
I stayed. I'm back.

03:23.725 --> 03:25.379
Okay. How's Izzy doing?

03:26.380 --> 03:28.730
Why, she's excellent.
Thank you for asking.

03:28.860 --> 03:31.167
She is at home
with Astrid.

03:31.298 --> 03:33.561
Sounds like a good idea
given what she went through.

03:33.691 --> 03:35.824
What you all went through.

03:39.393 --> 03:41.656
That PhD after your name
says you know something

03:41.786 --> 03:44.006
about post-traumatic stressMm.

03:44.136 --> 03:45.399
and how to deal with it.

03:45.529 --> 03:46.791
There's no need
for you to hurry back.

03:46.922 --> 03:48.445
Everything is under control.

03:48.576 --> 03:50.404
You don't have
to be here.
Sure I do.

03:50.534 --> 03:51.970
My name's on the door.

03:52.101 --> 03:53.407
Actually, it isn't.

03:53.537 --> 03:54.973
Well, it's a good thing
I'm here, then.

03:55.104 --> 03:57.193
We can do something
about it. Hey.

03:57.324 --> 03:58.760
Where are you going?

03:58.890 --> 04:00.805
See a new client.Okay, we did not
take him on

04:00.936 --> 04:02.285
without consulting you.
The Federal Defenders Office

04:02.416 --> 04:04.156
assigned him to Chunk.

04:04.287 --> 04:06.463
Oh. And who is
this lucky person?

04:06.594 --> 04:09.336
Name's Jerry McDonnell.
The FBI hit him

04:09.466 --> 04:11.251
with a quick-knock raid.What's the charge?

04:11.381 --> 04:12.164
Spying.

04:12.295 --> 04:13.731
Ooh. Espionage.

04:13.862 --> 04:14.993
That could be
interesting.

04:15.124 --> 04:17.344
Let's see what he has to say.

04:17.474 --> 04:19.781
Wasn't he supposed to be
staying home for a little while?

04:19.911 --> 04:21.478
BULL:
Government says

04:21.609 --> 04:23.567
McDonnell distributed
classified information

04:23.698 --> 04:25.265
about nuclear weapons?

04:25.395 --> 04:27.092
There's a government
facility in Kentucky

04:27.223 --> 04:31.183
that stores radioactive material
from decommissioned warheads.

04:31.314 --> 04:32.663
They've had accidents.

04:32.794 --> 04:34.665
The locals claim they've
released radioactive gas.

04:34.796 --> 04:36.841
McDonnell got his hands
on some documents

04:36.972 --> 04:39.627
describing these accidents
and put them on the Internet.

04:39.757 --> 04:41.933
Well, apparently,
the place has a website.

04:42.064 --> 04:43.283
It's not exactly
a secret lab.

04:43.413 --> 04:44.936
No, but they have
a lot of secrets.

04:45.067 --> 04:46.938
These documents talk about
the moving and storage

04:47.069 --> 04:48.679
of nuclear material.

04:48.810 --> 04:50.768
The government thinks that's
national defense information,

04:50.899 --> 04:53.815
and they've charged him with 12
counts under the Espionage Act.

04:53.945 --> 04:55.556
[sighs]:
Espionage Act.

04:55.686 --> 04:57.601
Does he know
what that's about?

04:57.732 --> 04:59.821
I'm guessing
he does not.

04:59.951 --> 05:02.606
Ah. So we're giving him
the bad news. Great.

05:02.737 --> 05:04.216
[cell door closing]

05:04.347 --> 05:07.437
I work for a nonprofit
that advocates for clean water.

05:07.568 --> 05:11.398
So how'd you go from clean water
to nuclear secrets?

05:11.528 --> 05:13.269
I grew up near the facility.

05:13.400 --> 05:14.836
I still have family in the area.

05:14.966 --> 05:16.185
It's a seriousconcern

05:16.316 --> 05:18.187
for people down there.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.276
Everyone's heard rumors
about leaks...

05:20.407 --> 05:23.584
fires that spread
radioactive ash.

05:23.714 --> 05:25.542
There's been a lot
of unexplained illness.

05:25.673 --> 05:27.152
Cancer clusters
and such.

05:27.283 --> 05:28.763
So when I...

05:28.893 --> 05:31.374
I obtained the documents,
I had to make them public,

05:31.505 --> 05:33.376
because they show
that there were leaks

05:33.507 --> 05:35.378
of radioactive material.

05:35.509 --> 05:37.337
Poison's been spread

05:37.467 --> 05:39.991
a half mile from where
my mother and father live,

05:40.122 --> 05:42.516
which the facility has denied
up and down.

05:42.646 --> 05:44.692
So, you knew that
you could get in trouble?

05:44.822 --> 05:47.085
I posted them
under a fake handle.

05:47.216 --> 05:48.565
I thought that

05:48.696 --> 05:50.306
would keep me anonymous;
not so much, I guess.

05:50.437 --> 05:53.527
You said you "obtained"
these documents.

05:53.657 --> 05:55.485
Who gave them to you?

05:57.139 --> 05:58.358
Jerry, you need
to tell us.

05:58.488 --> 05:59.924
It could be
our only bargaining chip.

06:00.055 --> 06:02.100
I don't see how. He's dead.

06:03.188 --> 06:04.451
He was a friend
from high school.

06:04.581 --> 06:06.278
He had leukemia.

06:06.409 --> 06:08.803
Which he thought he got
from the facility.

06:08.933 --> 06:10.544
Maybe he did, maybe he didn't.

06:10.674 --> 06:12.676
But doesn't his family have
the right to know

06:12.807 --> 06:14.417
what he'd been exposed to?

06:14.548 --> 06:16.680
This has zero to do
with national security.

06:16.811 --> 06:18.203
I put out those documents

06:18.334 --> 06:19.770
so people would know
what was in their air

06:19.901 --> 06:21.032
and water.

06:21.163 --> 06:22.686
They have a right to know that.

06:22.817 --> 06:24.079
I agree.

06:24.209 --> 06:26.864
And we should tell
the jury that.

06:26.995 --> 06:28.388
But we can't.

06:28.518 --> 06:30.259
Why not?Because you're
being charged

06:30.390 --> 06:33.044
under the Espionage Act,
and that is kryptonite

06:33.175 --> 06:34.655
for a defense.

06:34.785 --> 06:36.134
We cannot discuss

06:36.265 --> 06:39.137
your motives or the consequences
of your actions.

06:39.268 --> 06:41.618
The reasons, whatever
you hoped to accomplish,

06:41.749 --> 06:42.967
none of it

06:43.098 --> 06:45.405
is admissible in court.

06:45.535 --> 06:47.668
Most people in your
position plead guilty.

06:47.798 --> 06:50.061
What would happen if I did that?

06:50.192 --> 06:52.629
Well, the charges call
for a 30-year sentence,

06:52.760 --> 06:54.414
but with a plea deal,

06:54.544 --> 06:55.980
we'd be looking at less.

06:56.111 --> 06:57.504
I was trying to help people.

06:57.634 --> 06:59.767
They want to put me in prison
for 30 years?

06:59.897 --> 07:01.421
We're gonna talk to the AUSA

07:01.551 --> 07:03.379
and see what
he's thinking.

07:04.380 --> 07:05.512
Jerry.

07:05.642 --> 07:07.731
It's gonna be okay.

07:08.732 --> 07:10.255
How?

07:11.256 --> 07:12.780
Thanks, Marissa.
Appreciate it.

07:12.910 --> 07:14.390
What's she got
on AUSA Carto?

07:14.521 --> 07:16.305
CHUNK:
Been in office about six years.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.263
Some kind of cop
before that.Anything else?

07:18.394 --> 07:20.048
He wins. A lot.

07:20.178 --> 07:21.832
The famous Dr. Bull.

07:21.963 --> 07:23.486
Ha! Famous, huh?

07:23.617 --> 07:24.922
Walt Carto.

07:25.053 --> 07:27.490
Chester Palmer.
Chief counsel for TAC.

07:27.621 --> 07:30.014
Good for you.
So, Jerry McDonnell.

07:30.145 --> 07:31.538
What are we doing?
Talking a deal?

07:31.668 --> 07:33.540
12 counts and 30 years

07:33.670 --> 07:36.717
seems unacceptable and abusive.

07:36.847 --> 07:38.196
Yeah, well,
I like to come in strong,

07:38.327 --> 07:40.590
but I can go down
to four counts and 20.

07:40.721 --> 07:42.200
CHUNK:
You want to put
this man away

07:42.331 --> 07:44.333
for 20 years for trying
to protect his community?

07:44.464 --> 07:46.727
No, I want to put him away for
30, but I'll take the haircut

07:46.857 --> 07:48.337
if it'll save the cost
of a trial. [chuckles]

07:48.468 --> 07:50.339
You believe McDonnell deserves
that kind of punishment?

07:50.470 --> 07:52.950
The material this facility
processes is the actual payload

07:53.081 --> 07:54.474
from a nuclear warhead.

07:54.604 --> 07:56.780
You want to make a dirty bomb,
a suitcase nuke,

07:56.911 --> 07:58.521
Aw, come on.this is the place
you target.

07:58.652 --> 08:00.305
McDonnell drew
the bad guys a map.

08:00.436 --> 08:02.133
CHUNK:
No. What he did

08:02.264 --> 08:04.179
was try to inform his friends
and family about the toxins

08:04.309 --> 08:06.964
they were breathing in.Okay, look,
I don't care why he did it.

08:07.095 --> 08:08.575
The government decides
what's secret, okay?

08:08.705 --> 08:09.924
Can't tolerate

08:10.054 --> 08:11.229
people thinking
what McDonnell did

08:11.360 --> 08:14.276
is anything less
than deadly serious.

08:14.406 --> 08:17.279
20 years or no deal.

08:17.409 --> 08:18.976
But, I mean, if you
want to keep it coming,

08:19.107 --> 08:20.978
keep it coming, 'cause
I do enjoy the back-and-forth.

08:21.109 --> 08:23.198
Who hit you, Walt, Mom or Dad?

08:23.328 --> 08:24.634
What are you talking about?

08:24.765 --> 08:26.897
Most bullies were
physically abused as children.

08:27.028 --> 08:29.596
I'm sorry, you're saying I'm
a bully now for doing my job?

08:29.726 --> 08:32.729
Not for doing your job.
Just, it's this.

08:32.860 --> 08:34.035
It's what they call
a Duchenne smile.

08:34.165 --> 08:35.515
It's a sign
of genuine pleasure.

08:35.645 --> 08:38.126
Now, you may think
putting Jerry McDonnell away

08:38.256 --> 08:40.520
is necessary,
even important...

08:40.650 --> 08:43.348
but you can't say
it's fun, Walt.

08:43.479 --> 08:45.350
Not unless you're a bully.

08:47.527 --> 08:48.963
You have my offer.

08:49.093 --> 08:51.182
Talk to your client.

08:54.011 --> 08:55.665
That escalated quickly.

08:55.796 --> 08:57.841
I mean, 20 years is a long time,
but it's still less

08:57.972 --> 09:00.104
than 30.A bad deal's a bad deal.

09:00.235 --> 09:02.237
You sure you want to fight
this out in court, Bull?

09:02.367 --> 09:06.067
We're gonna take
that smug bastard to trial...

09:06.197 --> 09:08.417
and it's gonna be fun.

09:11.507 --> 09:13.553
♪

09:21.038 --> 09:23.258
It's still so early.
You don't have to leave.Shh!

09:23.388 --> 09:24.607
You'll wake Mauricio.

09:24.738 --> 09:26.435
Erik, how much effort

09:26.566 --> 09:28.568
have we put into making our son
okay with the divorce?

09:28.698 --> 09:30.308
Let's not confuse things
by adding,

09:30.439 --> 09:32.484
"But every now and then
Mommy and Daddy hook up.

09:32.615 --> 09:33.442
"Come by sometime.

09:33.573 --> 09:34.574
You can watch."

09:34.704 --> 09:35.879
Now you're just being perverse.

09:36.010 --> 09:37.228
Have you seen my shoes?Yeah,

09:37.359 --> 09:39.056
they're where
you always put them.

09:42.930 --> 09:43.670
Mm.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.410
[sighs]

09:45.541 --> 09:47.717
You are leaving
because of Mauricio?

09:47.848 --> 09:51.329
Not because you want to get out
of here as fast as you can?

09:51.460 --> 09:53.549
Amazingly, no.

09:54.506 --> 09:56.204
I'd like to stay.

09:56.334 --> 09:58.815
If our son's bedroom
wasn't 20 feet away.

09:58.946 --> 10:00.121
Well...

10:00.251 --> 10:01.905
if you prefer the
sneaky approach,

10:02.036 --> 10:05.343
my company does keep a
hotel room at the St. Blair.

10:06.344 --> 10:08.956
We could meet there
for lunch or...

10:09.086 --> 10:10.435
you know.

10:11.436 --> 10:13.700
Lunch at TAC lasts
just long enough

10:13.830 --> 10:16.180
for a handful
of Cheez-Its, but...

10:16.311 --> 10:18.226
thanks for the invitation.

10:28.105 --> 10:29.846
[exhales]:
Mm...

10:29.977 --> 10:33.067
This is not a place
I expected to be again.

10:33.197 --> 10:34.459
Me, neither.

10:34.590 --> 10:35.722
But I like it.

10:35.852 --> 10:37.549
[laughs]

10:39.116 --> 10:40.683
Mm-mm.

10:40.814 --> 10:42.119
[laughs]

10:44.165 --> 10:46.471
BULL: And that's the thing
about this case--

10:46.602 --> 10:49.300
we've lost before we start.

10:49.431 --> 10:51.868
Our client
obtained documents

10:51.999 --> 10:53.609
he did not have clearance
to possess,

10:53.740 --> 10:55.393
and he gave them to others
who also lacked clearance.

10:55.524 --> 10:57.047
And those are the elements
of the crime,

10:57.178 --> 10:58.658
and we cannot contest them.

10:58.788 --> 10:59.920
DANNY:
Why did we take

11:00.050 --> 11:01.399
this case, exactly?

11:01.530 --> 11:03.314
Our job is to make the jury
see it differently.

11:03.445 --> 11:05.055
Jerry McDonnell was
a concerned citizen,

11:05.186 --> 11:07.971
and he was revealing
important information

11:08.102 --> 11:09.886
to a threatened
community.

11:10.017 --> 11:12.759
It all comes down
to the press, Danny.

11:12.889 --> 11:15.370
I want every report,
every rumor

11:15.500 --> 11:16.893
you can find
on this facility.

11:17.024 --> 11:18.678
'Cause when those jurors
walk into the court

11:18.808 --> 11:20.680
and they hear
the words "nuclear facility,"

11:20.810 --> 11:23.639
I want them to think
"environmental catastrophe."

11:23.770 --> 11:25.815
I'll see what I can dig up.

11:25.946 --> 11:27.512
Juries have to be
independent thinkers,

11:27.643 --> 11:28.688
people who
instinctively distrust

11:28.818 --> 11:30.124
everything
the government tells them.

11:30.254 --> 11:31.952
Who doesn't do that?

11:33.040 --> 11:34.737
Just saying.

11:37.218 --> 11:39.786
We need the real deal:
true disbelievers.

11:39.916 --> 11:41.701
Exactly how big a tinfoil hat
are we looking for?

11:41.831 --> 11:44.399
[sighs]
How big you got?

11:44.529 --> 11:46.575
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.446
This case is about
government secrets.

11:48.577 --> 11:50.231
Nuclear weapons.

11:50.361 --> 11:52.407
National security.

11:52.537 --> 11:54.278
So what I would like
to speak to you about

11:54.409 --> 11:55.845
is canned goods.

11:56.977 --> 11:58.282
You, sir.

11:58.413 --> 11:59.414
How many cans
would you say

11:59.544 --> 12:01.851
are in your cabinets right now?

12:01.982 --> 12:03.113
Uh...

12:03.244 --> 12:04.593
I don't know.

12:04.724 --> 12:05.942
Uh...

12:06.073 --> 12:07.465
a half dozen?

12:07.596 --> 12:09.250
CHUNK:
All right. And, uh,

12:09.380 --> 12:10.425
what about you, ma'am?

12:10.555 --> 12:12.470
Uh, not many.

12:12.601 --> 12:13.994
I like fresh ingredients.

12:14.124 --> 12:15.212
Okay.

12:15.343 --> 12:16.736
And, you.

12:16.866 --> 12:19.216
I keep a six-month supply
of canned and dry goods,

12:19.347 --> 12:21.436
which I rotate
by expiration date.

12:21.566 --> 12:22.654
Hello.
CHUNK:
And anything else

12:22.785 --> 12:24.091
in that well-stocked pantry

12:24.221 --> 12:25.570
of yours?Propane stove.

12:25.701 --> 12:27.137
Supply of fuel.

12:27.268 --> 12:29.139
Plus two 50-gallon drums
of distilled water.

12:29.270 --> 12:30.662
I think I like her.

12:30.793 --> 12:32.882
When civilization as we know it
collapses,

12:33.013 --> 12:35.015
I intend to survive.

12:35.145 --> 12:36.233
Bingo.

12:36.364 --> 12:37.147
We have a prepper.

12:37.278 --> 12:38.409
Your Honor, this juror

12:38.540 --> 12:39.846
is acceptable to the defense.

12:41.499 --> 12:44.328
It says here that you refused
to join a family tree website.

12:44.459 --> 12:46.635
Why?
They wanted a sample
of my DNA.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.289
You know they're going
straight to the government,

12:48.419 --> 12:50.682
and with the cloning
they're doing,

12:50.813 --> 12:52.249
they could produce
a whole army of me.

12:52.380 --> 12:53.468
What's that gonna be like?

12:53.598 --> 12:54.686
That's a good question.

12:54.817 --> 12:56.253
Your Honor, this juror

12:56.384 --> 12:57.864
is acceptable
to the defense.

12:57.994 --> 12:59.517
We have one pick left--

12:59.648 --> 13:01.432
between 14 and nine.

13:01.563 --> 13:02.825
MARISSA:
14. Bonnie Kaplow.

13:02.956 --> 13:04.044
Votes independent.

13:04.174 --> 13:05.697
I checked
her social media feed.

13:05.828 --> 13:07.134
It's government-skeptical.

13:07.264 --> 13:08.831
Let's go with 14.

13:08.962 --> 13:11.051
She's detail-oriented,
educated--

13:11.181 --> 13:13.618
the kind of leader the
other jurors are gonna follow.

13:13.749 --> 13:15.098
Carto's all over us,

13:15.229 --> 13:16.665
and he still has
one peremptory challenge left.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.449
So you think if we
show interest,

13:18.580 --> 13:19.537
he'll kick her?

13:19.668 --> 13:21.409
I'm sure of it.

13:21.539 --> 13:22.802
Mm.

13:22.932 --> 13:24.368
I'm gonna head-fake him.

13:24.499 --> 13:26.196
He's gonna head-fake him?What does that even mean?

13:26.327 --> 13:28.242
Ma'am, you mentioned
that you have a relative

13:28.372 --> 13:29.634
in the military.

13:29.765 --> 13:30.635
Correct?

13:30.766 --> 13:32.463
A cousin. Why?

13:32.594 --> 13:33.682
Your Honor, I move

13:33.813 --> 13:35.031
to dismiss this
juror for cause.

13:35.162 --> 13:37.251
Her connection to the military
prejudices her

13:37.381 --> 13:39.470
in favor of the government.Your Honor,

13:39.601 --> 13:40.732
the defense has
tried to manipulate

13:40.863 --> 13:42.386
this voir dire
from the start.

13:42.517 --> 13:44.475
The challenge is ridiculous
and so is the motion.

13:44.606 --> 13:46.216
Won't fly, Counsel.
Motion denied.

13:46.347 --> 13:48.958
And as far as the government
is concerned, juror number 14

13:49.089 --> 13:50.090
is acceptable.

13:50.220 --> 13:51.439
JUDGE:
We have a jury.

13:52.744 --> 13:53.876
Hello.

13:54.007 --> 13:56.052
IZZY:
We're in the kitchen.

13:57.358 --> 13:59.099
What's going
on in here?

13:59.229 --> 14:00.491
This is...

14:00.622 --> 14:02.624
ADA Mary O'Neill.
She's prosecuting

14:02.754 --> 14:03.973
the kidnapping.

14:04.104 --> 14:05.453
We spoke when the police
took your statement.

14:05.583 --> 14:08.195
So what's happening?
Is something wrong?

14:08.325 --> 14:09.631
No, no,
nothing's wrong.

14:09.761 --> 14:10.850
I was just telling
your wife

14:10.980 --> 14:12.677
that both the mother and the son

14:12.808 --> 14:14.854
who abducted your daughter
have decided to plead guilty.

14:14.984 --> 14:16.551
So no trial,Jason.

14:16.681 --> 14:18.727
Isn't that great?What's the sentence?

14:18.858 --> 14:20.294
We're still hammering
out the details,

14:20.424 --> 14:22.165
but they will
be substantial.

14:22.296 --> 14:23.993
I just wanted you
to know,

14:24.124 --> 14:25.865
because I know sometimes
victims get anxious

14:25.995 --> 14:27.867
about the prospect
of court proceedings.

14:27.997 --> 14:28.955
We're not anxious.

14:29.085 --> 14:30.173
I was.

14:30.304 --> 14:31.305
[Izzy sighs]

14:31.435 --> 14:32.697
Thank you for telling us.

14:32.828 --> 14:34.047
It's no problem.

14:34.177 --> 14:37.224
Uh, also, I wanted
to give you this.

14:37.354 --> 14:38.660
[clears throat]

14:43.534 --> 14:46.407
[distorted]: Hi, baby girl.
It's Daddy. You're okay.

14:46.537 --> 14:48.278
Shut up!

14:49.976 --> 14:51.064
O'NEILL:
...car when he was arrested.

14:51.194 --> 14:52.630
We've been holding it
for evidence.

14:52.761 --> 14:54.241
I thought your daughter
might want it back.

14:54.371 --> 14:55.982
Thank you.
She's been missing it.

14:56.112 --> 14:57.244
I'll bring it to her.

14:57.374 --> 14:58.854
I'm pretty sure
she's sleeping.

14:58.985 --> 15:01.465
I'll just put it in her crib.

15:04.077 --> 15:06.949
[sighing]

15:08.733 --> 15:10.866
[takes deep breath]

15:14.609 --> 15:18.091
THOMAS:
It's hell when someone takes
your child from you, isn't it?

15:18.221 --> 15:20.267
IZZY:
Hey.

15:21.833 --> 15:23.531
You've been in here
awhile.

15:23.661 --> 15:25.054
Is everything okay?

15:26.273 --> 15:28.144
Yeah.

15:28.275 --> 15:31.017
Well, O'Neill left.
She said to say goodbye.

15:34.542 --> 15:36.500
Jason, is everything all right?

15:36.631 --> 15:38.850
For real.

15:38.981 --> 15:41.418
[whispers]:
Absolutely.

15:42.593 --> 15:44.900
[chuckles]:
Aw, come on. I'm fine.

15:47.642 --> 15:49.165
[sighs]

15:57.434 --> 15:59.175
Don't get comfortable.

15:59.306 --> 16:02.613
What?
Just heard from
the judge's clerk.

16:02.744 --> 16:04.789
We got trouble.

16:06.878 --> 16:08.837
The AUSA has brought
to my attention

16:08.968 --> 16:10.186
some social media posts
of a significantly

16:10.317 --> 16:11.579
antigovernment nature

16:11.709 --> 16:12.884
which Mr. Carto believes

16:13.015 --> 16:15.191
were written by this juror,
Ms. Kaplow.

16:15.322 --> 16:16.279
Ma'am, did you post these?

16:16.410 --> 16:17.715
I remind you
you're under oath.

16:17.846 --> 16:19.717
Yes. I did.

16:19.848 --> 16:21.197
CARTO:Well, then I believe
we have a problem.

16:21.328 --> 16:23.069
BULL:
Your Honor,
we've examined the posts,

16:23.199 --> 16:25.636
and yes, they are passionate
and strongly worded...

16:25.767 --> 16:27.203
"Dismantle
the FBI

16:27.334 --> 16:29.727
and the whole"--
I won't read the next word,

16:29.858 --> 16:32.643
but it rhymes with "trucking"--
"Justice Department,

16:32.774 --> 16:34.994
destroy them
and salt the earth around them."

16:35.124 --> 16:36.256
You're telling me
she's impartial?

16:36.386 --> 16:38.519
Ms. Kaplow, you're dismissed.

16:38.649 --> 16:40.086
Thank you
for your brief service.CHUNK: Your Honor,

16:40.216 --> 16:42.305
we object to this in the
strongest possible terms.

16:42.436 --> 16:44.003
Of course you do. Anything else?

16:51.097 --> 16:52.620
Uh, you know,

16:52.750 --> 16:54.274
that was an okay stunt
you pulled in voir dire.

16:54.404 --> 16:56.711
Crossed me up a minute,
and then I realized 14 was

16:56.841 --> 16:58.191
your keystone juror.
[chuckles]

16:58.321 --> 17:00.106
See, that's the thing
about bullies.

17:00.236 --> 17:02.586
We win.

17:02.717 --> 17:05.024
[chuckles]
Duchenne smile?

17:05.154 --> 17:06.764
Right?

17:06.895 --> 17:08.636
Now I know what it is.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.073
BULL:
How did Carto get

17:11.204 --> 17:12.727
those posts and we didn't?

17:12.857 --> 17:14.598
They were on an obscure site.
She used a screen handle

17:14.729 --> 17:16.861
she didn't use anywhere else.You didn't answer
my question!

17:16.992 --> 17:18.689
Carto found them. Why didn't we?

17:18.820 --> 17:21.170
He has the entire
Justice Department behind him.

17:21.301 --> 17:22.737
He can get a hundred people
to do his search.

17:22.867 --> 17:24.956
I'm one person.
It's not a fair fight.

17:25.087 --> 17:26.741
Is that what I'm supposed
to tell Jerry McDonnell

17:26.871 --> 17:28.351
when he serves 30 years
in prison?

17:28.482 --> 17:30.919
Sorry, but Taylor said
it wasn't a fair fight.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.530
I did what you asked.

17:33.661 --> 17:35.489
You wanted jurors who were
skeptical of the government.

17:35.619 --> 17:37.360
I found them.Well, they're useless

17:37.491 --> 17:39.101
if we can't keep them
on the jury.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.930
No more mistakes.

17:43.236 --> 17:45.412
He's just wound up.

17:45.542 --> 17:47.588
I'm going to lunch.

17:48.980 --> 17:51.244
It's 10:15.

17:51.374 --> 17:53.333
Hey, got some stuff
on the nuclear facility.

17:53.463 --> 17:56.553
An IG's report and some locals
who will talk to reporters.

17:56.684 --> 17:58.077
Good. Now I need something else.

17:58.207 --> 18:00.296
What?Everything you can
get on the AUSA,

18:00.427 --> 18:01.645
Walter Carto.

18:01.776 --> 18:03.865
Background.
Weaknesses. Skeletons.

18:03.995 --> 18:05.519
Well, I've got more leads
I wanted to track down

18:05.649 --> 18:07.173
on the nuclear stuff.
Can it wait a day?

18:07.303 --> 18:09.305
No, it cannot. I need
everything you can give me.

18:09.436 --> 18:11.481
Now.

18:12.700 --> 18:14.745
[line ringing]

18:14.876 --> 18:16.095
ERIK:
Hey.

18:16.225 --> 18:17.879
How soon can you be
at the St. Blair?

18:18.009 --> 18:19.402
[bell dings]

18:20.577 --> 18:22.101
It's not about being sensitive
to criticism--

18:22.231 --> 18:23.493
you know I can take that--

18:23.624 --> 18:25.321
but criticize me
for something real,

18:25.452 --> 18:26.844
not, "What do you mean

18:26.975 --> 18:28.150
you didn't search the
entire Internet?"

18:28.281 --> 18:30.021
I have done so much
for that man,

18:30.152 --> 18:32.023
but what he notices
is the one time

18:32.154 --> 18:34.156
I get beaten by
the U.S. government,

18:34.287 --> 18:36.332
using digital tools
I can only dream of.

18:36.463 --> 18:38.378
And now I'm gonna
stop talking,

18:38.508 --> 18:40.858
because I don't think you've
said anything since we came in.

18:40.989 --> 18:42.860
Sorry.It's okay.

18:42.991 --> 18:45.515
Look, you have every reason
to be mad at Bull--

18:45.646 --> 18:47.126
he was a jerk--

18:47.256 --> 18:49.867
but it sounds like
you're angry

18:49.998 --> 18:52.087
partly because you're worried...

18:52.218 --> 18:54.133
he was right, a little.

18:54.263 --> 18:56.047
Maybe you
should have caught it.

19:00.313 --> 19:02.489
How is it, after being
divorced this long,

19:02.619 --> 19:04.926
you still know me better
than anyone else?

19:06.449 --> 19:07.668
Thanks for listening.

19:07.798 --> 19:09.713
I'm sure this wasn't
what you had in mind

19:09.844 --> 19:11.715
when I said, "Let's
meet at the hotel."

19:11.846 --> 19:13.239
[laughs]:
What?

19:13.369 --> 19:15.241
A bitch session with my ex-wife
about her boss?

19:15.371 --> 19:17.765
Don't be ridiculous.
It's a classic nooner.

19:18.766 --> 19:20.724
I'm glad you called.

19:20.855 --> 19:22.683
Do it anytime.

19:22.813 --> 19:24.685
Thanks.

19:26.339 --> 19:28.384
♪

19:32.693 --> 19:34.564
Mm, I have to get
back to work.

19:34.695 --> 19:36.087
I'm sorry.
I'm an awful person.

19:38.351 --> 19:40.701
Just, um, let me say one thing

19:40.831 --> 19:42.181
before you go, okay?

19:42.311 --> 19:43.965
What's that?

19:44.095 --> 19:46.489
Uh, when we first...

19:46.620 --> 19:47.925
connected...

19:48.056 --> 19:49.492
I was with Rachel,
which was a problem.

19:49.623 --> 19:50.667
I never asked you

19:50.798 --> 19:52.408
to break up...I know. I know.

19:52.539 --> 19:54.193
I didn't break up with her
because of anything you did.

19:54.323 --> 19:56.064
But it was

19:56.195 --> 19:59.502
partly because of the way I
found myself feeling about you.

19:59.633 --> 20:01.330
Something real

20:01.461 --> 20:03.114
is happening between us.

20:03.245 --> 20:07.075
Like, we're finding our way back
to a real relationship.

20:08.076 --> 20:09.904
I don't know, Erik.
I think...

20:10.034 --> 20:11.819
[sighs]:
maybe this works

20:11.949 --> 20:13.908
because it's nothing
like a real relationship.

20:14.038 --> 20:15.910
It's different,
but that's okay.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.912
We're not the people we were
when we got divorced.

20:18.042 --> 20:19.740
We can be different.

20:20.741 --> 20:23.831
I need to know you think this
is going somewhere, because...

20:23.961 --> 20:26.137
I feel like it is.

20:27.138 --> 20:28.966
Let's see.

20:30.359 --> 20:32.622
STEADMAN:
I was part of a team

20:32.753 --> 20:34.450
that surveilled Mr. McDonnell
for about nine weeks.

20:34.581 --> 20:36.365
CARTO:And what were
you looking for?

20:36.496 --> 20:38.106
STEADMAN:
We were trying to determine
if he had possession

20:38.237 --> 20:39.934
of classified
national defense information

20:40.064 --> 20:41.718
that had been published
on the Internet.

20:41.849 --> 20:44.068
Did he?Yes. I saw the documents
on his computer myself.

20:44.199 --> 20:46.854
And their presence was confirmed
by forensic examination

20:46.984 --> 20:48.595
of the computer
after Mr. McDonnell

20:48.725 --> 20:50.466
was arrested.
Why were

20:50.597 --> 20:51.902
these documents significant?

20:52.033 --> 20:54.253
The facility described
in the documents

20:54.383 --> 20:56.516
stores what are known
as canned subassemblies.

20:56.646 --> 20:58.213
They hold
enriched uranium

20:58.344 --> 20:59.823
and other materials

20:59.954 --> 21:01.303
that detonate a nuclear warhead.

21:01.434 --> 21:02.826
Any terrorist would be
extremely motivated

21:02.957 --> 21:04.828
to get his hands on them.And these documents

21:04.959 --> 21:06.177
describe where they're stored,

21:06.308 --> 21:07.962
how they're transported,
correct?

21:08.092 --> 21:09.659
Mm-hmm.Highly, highly
valuable information.

21:09.790 --> 21:11.095
That's right.

21:11.226 --> 21:13.010
No further questions.

21:14.316 --> 21:15.883
He's a winker.

21:16.013 --> 21:17.363
[sighs]:
Bad news.

21:17.493 --> 21:20.235
The jury likes her.
That testimony killed.

21:20.366 --> 21:21.584
Give us a chance.

21:21.715 --> 21:23.325
CHUNK:Ms. Steadman,
how did you

21:23.456 --> 21:26.110
come to see the documents
on my client's computer?

21:26.241 --> 21:29.288
It's not the sort of thing
he would readily share, correct?

21:29.418 --> 21:31.899
I was working undercover
and had gained his trust.

21:32.029 --> 21:33.901
"Gained his trust"? That's
an interesting phrase.

21:34.031 --> 21:37.557
In fact, your job
was to insert yourself

21:37.687 --> 21:40.124
into Mr. McDonnell's life
by pretending to be

21:40.255 --> 21:42.605
romantically interested
in him

21:42.736 --> 21:44.303
and then spy on him.

21:44.433 --> 21:47.871
You lied about the most
personal things imaginable.

21:48.002 --> 21:51.310
Did you ever kiss this
man to gain his trust?

21:51.440 --> 21:53.355
Uh, we kissed a few times.

21:53.486 --> 21:55.314
Yes.Hmm.

21:55.444 --> 21:57.316
Quite an accomplishment,
isn't it?

21:57.446 --> 21:59.187
To get him to show you
these documents.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.798
Took a lot of trust,

22:01.929 --> 22:03.191
isn't that right?

22:03.322 --> 22:04.584
I guess.

22:04.714 --> 22:05.889
What did he talk about

22:06.020 --> 22:07.674
when he showed you
these documents?

22:07.804 --> 22:08.805
Objection, Your Honor.

22:08.936 --> 22:09.850
Relevance.

22:09.980 --> 22:11.025
This is the wedge.

22:11.155 --> 22:12.592
Let's see
if she lets us in.

22:12.722 --> 22:14.333
I'm willing to see
where this goes. Overruled.

22:14.463 --> 22:16.335
Good.
STEADMAN:
He...

22:16.465 --> 22:18.598
talked about what was
in the documents.

22:18.728 --> 22:20.077
Anything else?

22:21.078 --> 22:22.428
Agent?

22:22.558 --> 22:25.866
He... talked about the region
around the facility.

22:25.996 --> 22:27.868
Did he talk
about the people there as well?

22:27.998 --> 22:29.435
I guess.
You were
surveilling him.

22:29.565 --> 22:30.827
You had to have known

22:30.958 --> 22:32.351
what he did or
did not say.

22:32.481 --> 22:34.048
Yes, he talked about the people.

22:34.178 --> 22:36.355
Did he happen to mention
his concern for their health?

22:36.485 --> 22:38.400
Your Honor...That they were being poisoned

22:38.531 --> 22:40.359
I object
in the strongest terms possible.by leaks from this facility?

22:40.489 --> 22:42.361
Counsel is way outside the scope
of this proceeding.

22:42.491 --> 22:44.319
I was hoping you
wouldn't go there, Mr. Palmer.

22:44.450 --> 22:46.277
Damn it.Sustained. Move on.

22:48.279 --> 22:50.194
You mentioned terrorists.

22:50.325 --> 22:51.848
You found no evidence

22:51.979 --> 22:55.461
of any connection
between Mr. McDonnell

22:55.591 --> 22:57.854
and any individual
or terror groups, did you?

22:57.985 --> 22:59.682
That's right.Did he ever express

22:59.813 --> 23:03.730
any interest in any
anti-American or terror group?

23:03.860 --> 23:04.992
No.

23:05.122 --> 23:07.211
No further questions,
Your Honor.

23:09.257 --> 23:11.041
Redirect, Your Honor?

23:12.042 --> 23:13.479
You mentioned

23:13.609 --> 23:15.306
forensic analysis
of the computer.

23:15.437 --> 23:17.004
And it showed
Mr. McDonnell

23:17.134 --> 23:19.093
posted the documents on
several Internet sites, correct?

23:19.223 --> 23:21.269
That's right.Effectively making
them available

23:21.400 --> 23:23.837
to every terrorist in the world.
Isn't that right?

23:23.967 --> 23:26.187
Yes.No further questions.

23:27.667 --> 23:30.191
MARISSA:
You scored some points.

23:30.321 --> 23:32.236
Jury's got more questions
about the government's case,

23:32.367 --> 23:34.456
but it's not
enough to acquit.

23:34.587 --> 23:35.631
BULL:Yeah.

23:35.762 --> 23:37.459
We need more than skepticism.

23:37.590 --> 23:39.418
We need an excuse.

23:39.548 --> 23:40.810
Jurors need
to understand

23:40.941 --> 23:42.333
there's a justification
for what he did.

23:42.464 --> 23:43.422
No kidding.

23:43.552 --> 23:44.466
But how are we
gonna get it in?

23:44.597 --> 23:46.381
We tried the frontal assault.

23:46.512 --> 23:47.991
You saw how that went.MARISSA: Sorry
to bring it up,

23:48.122 --> 23:49.993
but is it time for a second
talk with the other side

23:50.124 --> 23:52.431
about a deal?
Carto is not
gonna discuss

23:52.561 --> 23:53.475
anything now.

23:53.606 --> 23:54.824
Why should he? He's winning.

23:54.955 --> 23:56.478
DANNY:
Hey.

23:56.609 --> 23:57.958
Sorry to break up the party.
I learned some things

23:58.088 --> 23:59.568
about Carto.What?

23:59.699 --> 24:01.962
Well, he was a sheriff's deputy
upstate for a few years,

24:02.092 --> 24:04.399
and then FBI
before he got his law degree.

24:04.530 --> 24:05.531
Married, divorced.

24:05.661 --> 24:06.967
In the FBI, he was

24:07.097 --> 24:08.447
a wiretap specialist
on RICO cases,

24:08.577 --> 24:10.100
[scoffs]but something
went wrong,

24:10.231 --> 24:11.537
and he was disciplined.

24:11.667 --> 24:12.973
Disciplined for what?No one can tell me.

24:13.103 --> 24:15.062
I'd have to look
in his personnel file.

24:15.192 --> 24:16.367
And why haven't you done that?

24:17.412 --> 24:18.848
Well, 'cause it's not like
I can just walk

24:18.979 --> 24:20.284
into the FBI and ask to see it.

24:20.415 --> 24:22.069
Well, then you find another way
to do it!

24:22.199 --> 24:23.070
Or are you
quitting?

24:23.200 --> 24:24.027
Do you quit?!

24:24.158 --> 24:25.028
CHUNK:
Bull.

24:25.159 --> 24:26.073
That's a little harsh.

24:28.162 --> 24:29.685
I'm not quitting.

24:29.816 --> 24:31.557
Then why are we talking?

24:31.687 --> 24:33.515
Do it!

24:37.476 --> 24:40.304
I'll talk to him.

24:43.525 --> 24:44.874
Not sure if I agree

24:45.005 --> 24:46.397
with your
motivational technique.

24:46.528 --> 24:48.182
With Danny orTaylor.Oh, I'm sorry,

24:48.312 --> 24:50.401
did I hurt someone's feelings?

24:50.532 --> 24:52.621
Heavens. Let me sit down
and pen an apology.

24:52.752 --> 24:54.144
I just, I have to...Look,

24:54.275 --> 24:56.016
if you're gonna ask
if I'm okay, Marissa,

24:56.146 --> 24:57.452
I'm gonna throw something.

24:57.583 --> 24:59.410
All right, I won't do that.

24:59.541 --> 25:00.760
Thank you.

25:00.890 --> 25:03.545
Look, everyone is frustrated.

25:03.676 --> 25:05.199
It's worse than that.

25:05.329 --> 25:07.636
I feel like
we've strapped Jerry McDonnell

25:07.767 --> 25:11.205
to the front of a car and we're
gonna drive him off a cliff.

25:11.335 --> 25:13.903
We knew what defending against
the Espionage Act would be like.

25:14.034 --> 25:17.037
It's brutal. That's why most
people confess and plea out.

25:18.038 --> 25:19.518
That's an idea.

25:19.648 --> 25:21.041
Plea out? Chunk said...

25:21.171 --> 25:23.086
No, that's not what I mean.Then what did you...

25:23.217 --> 25:24.740
Okay.

25:25.915 --> 25:27.526
Hi.

25:27.656 --> 25:29.179
Don't drink too
much coffee.

25:29.310 --> 25:30.746
We got to meet McDonnell
first thing in the morning.

25:30.877 --> 25:33.270
Why?So we can convince him
to confess.

25:37.927 --> 25:39.276
I don't understand.
If I confess, doesn't that mean

25:39.407 --> 25:40.582
I'll go to prison for sure?We're hoping

25:40.713 --> 25:42.192
it'll keep you
out of prison.

25:42.323 --> 25:43.716
We're not contesting
the elements of the crime.

25:43.846 --> 25:45.935
You'll just be saying
what we've admitted.

25:46.066 --> 25:48.024
Okay. I guess.We'll also need you

25:48.155 --> 25:50.636
to name the person
who gave you the documents.I told you,

25:50.766 --> 25:51.941
he's dead.

25:52.072 --> 25:53.116
What's the point
of saying his name?

25:53.247 --> 25:55.554
We want you to say
more than that.

25:56.467 --> 25:58.339
CHUNK:Just to be clear, the
documents in question,

25:58.469 --> 26:00.123
you had them?I did.

26:00.254 --> 26:01.560
And you put them
on the Internet?

26:01.690 --> 26:02.996
Yes.

26:03.126 --> 26:04.475
How did you get them
in the first place?

26:04.606 --> 26:06.303
I got a call from a friend
from high school.

26:06.434 --> 26:08.218
His name was
Lane Burrell.

36:02.029 --> 36:03.770
gonna have his friend tap
our phones to intercept

36:03.900 --> 36:05.772
the report from
our source.I've got a digital watchdog

36:05.902 --> 36:07.469
on our phone system.

36:07.600 --> 36:08.862
Anyone tries to get in,
I'll know.

36:08.992 --> 36:09.993
Can't the FBI get past that?

36:10.124 --> 36:11.299
Well, the FBI could.

36:11.430 --> 36:12.779
Carto's working with some
private numbnut.

36:12.909 --> 36:14.041
Can't beat Taylor.

36:14.172 --> 36:15.825
CHUNK:And what happensif Carto

36:15.956 --> 36:17.958
doesn't fall for it?BULL:
You go in tomorrow,

36:18.088 --> 36:20.047
tell the judge we were wrong
about the Brady violation,

36:20.178 --> 36:22.615
give a beautiful closing
argument, and we lose.

36:25.705 --> 36:28.098
Okay, I don't care
if I am an officer of the court,

36:28.229 --> 36:31.232
I'm either gonna be in on the
play or there won't be no play.

36:31.363 --> 36:33.365
[computer beeps]Ooh.

36:33.495 --> 36:35.541
11:54. Is that Carto?

36:35.671 --> 36:37.195
It's definitely somebody
trying to get in.

36:37.325 --> 36:38.848
I just can't tell who
or where they are.

36:38.979 --> 36:40.198
MARISSA:
So we don't know

36:40.328 --> 36:42.025
for sure if it's Carto.

36:42.156 --> 36:43.636
Is that enough?

36:43.766 --> 36:45.072
Yeah.

36:45.203 --> 36:46.900
If you're here to ask
for another deal,

36:47.030 --> 36:48.162
you could save it.

36:48.293 --> 36:49.990
I like my chances
with the jury.

36:50.120 --> 36:52.122
I am here about a deal, but
it's not for Jerry McDonnell.

36:52.253 --> 36:53.689
Who, then?
We know you
tried to place

36:53.820 --> 36:55.822
illegal surveillance equipment
on our office today.

36:55.952 --> 36:57.867
And we know you've
done it before,

36:57.998 --> 37:00.218
as a U.S. attorney
and with the FBI.

37:01.262 --> 37:03.438
Cool, cool. Where's your proof?

37:03.569 --> 37:04.918
Right now
we're preparing a subpoena

37:05.048 --> 37:06.572
for your little
wiretapping buddy.

37:06.702 --> 37:09.052
And you know how this story
goes, don't you, Walt?

37:09.183 --> 37:12.404
He's gonna flip on you, and then
you're gonna be in prison

37:12.534 --> 37:13.883
before the end
of the year.

37:14.014 --> 37:15.929
And that'll be the end
of your career.

37:18.148 --> 37:19.846
No.

37:21.239 --> 37:22.414
What do you mean, no?

37:22.544 --> 37:24.329
If you were
gonna do that,

37:24.459 --> 37:26.069
you would have already done it;
we wouldn't be standing here.

37:26.200 --> 37:27.680
I'd be in a room
with a dozen lawyers.

37:27.810 --> 37:28.985
No, no, no, no.

37:29.116 --> 37:30.683
See, you don't want me
arrested.

37:30.813 --> 37:32.250
You're right.

37:32.380 --> 37:34.339
I don't want you arrested.No.

37:34.469 --> 37:36.254
You know what I want?Hmm?

37:36.384 --> 37:37.951
I want you to give Jerry
a plea agreement,

37:38.081 --> 37:39.474
and that agreement
is going to state

37:39.605 --> 37:41.607
very clearly
that he does no jail time.

37:41.737 --> 37:43.783
And then we will sit on
what we know about you,

37:43.913 --> 37:45.480
and you can have
your career,

37:45.611 --> 37:47.308
your reputation
and your freedom.

37:47.439 --> 37:50.093
And Jerry gets his freedom,
and that is gonna be the deal.

37:50.224 --> 37:52.574
I can't do it.

37:52.705 --> 37:54.272
I answer to people,

37:54.402 --> 37:58.101
and they take what McDonnell did
very seriously.

37:58.232 --> 37:59.581
You have an hour to think
about it.

37:59.712 --> 38:01.279
Get it done.

38:01.409 --> 38:03.542
[chuckles]
See? That's the Duchenne smile.

38:03.672 --> 38:05.674
[sighs]

38:05.805 --> 38:07.459
[chuckles]

38:09.287 --> 38:10.288
[lock buzzes]

38:11.332 --> 38:13.291
No prison time?None.

38:13.421 --> 38:15.467
They're requiring
long probation-- seven years--

38:15.597 --> 38:17.295
and you can't go on the Internet

38:17.425 --> 38:19.166
for 22 months, and there's
some community service

38:19.297 --> 38:20.602
and a few other things, but...

38:20.733 --> 38:22.082
[laughs]:
But no prison time.

38:22.212 --> 38:23.388
Nope.

38:23.518 --> 38:26.216
None.[laughing]

38:26.347 --> 38:28.349
[suppressed sob]

38:30.656 --> 38:31.787
I...

38:31.918 --> 38:33.311
[laughs]
I can't...

38:34.834 --> 38:35.835
Thank you.

38:35.965 --> 38:37.053
Thank you so much.

38:37.184 --> 38:38.925
You got it.

38:39.055 --> 38:41.449
How did you and Dr. Bull
pull this off?

38:41.580 --> 38:43.016
Well...

38:43.146 --> 38:46.106
that's a long story.

38:46.236 --> 38:47.890
[laughs]

38:50.806 --> 38:52.112
Hey.

38:52.242 --> 38:53.766
Hey.
Is the little guy
ready to go?

38:53.896 --> 38:55.158
Yeah, he'll be here
in a minute.

38:55.289 --> 38:56.638
There was a small problem.

38:56.769 --> 38:58.118
What?The other night

38:58.248 --> 38:59.989
when you were here
and didn't want him to know--

39:00.120 --> 39:01.600
it turns out he knew.

39:01.730 --> 39:03.689
He came into the bedroom
and saw us while we were asleep.

39:03.819 --> 39:05.038
I just found out today.

39:05.168 --> 39:07.301
But it's okay.
I took care of it.

39:07.432 --> 39:09.303
What do you mean,
you took care of it?

39:09.434 --> 39:10.783
It's fine.
He's a little cranky,

39:10.913 --> 39:12.045
but he'll get over it.

39:12.175 --> 39:13.699
[laughs]:
Hey, buddy.

39:13.829 --> 39:15.831
It's been a blast.
A hug?

39:15.962 --> 39:17.790
Okay.

39:19.400 --> 39:21.359
Mauricio! Hey!

39:21.489 --> 39:22.534
Stop!

39:24.405 --> 39:27.365
What's going on?
Come on, tell me.

39:27.495 --> 39:29.279
Dad lied to me.

39:30.106 --> 39:32.282
He told me I
didn't see you,

39:32.413 --> 39:33.588
but I did.

39:33.719 --> 39:36.025
He kept saying
you weren't there,

39:36.156 --> 39:37.723
it was a dream,
but it wasn't.

39:37.853 --> 39:39.899
I know I saw you.

39:40.029 --> 39:42.467
You're right, buddy, you did.

39:42.597 --> 39:44.164
So why did Dad lie to me?

39:44.294 --> 39:46.427
He did that to help me.

39:46.558 --> 39:47.907
He thought that's
what I wanted.

39:48.037 --> 39:49.387
I'm so sorry.

39:49.517 --> 39:52.172
We didn't mean to get you
caught up in this.

39:52.302 --> 39:53.478
It just happened.

39:53.608 --> 39:56.524
But you still shouldn't lie,
right?

39:56.655 --> 39:59.266
No. You shouldn't.

39:59.397 --> 40:01.964
You should always tell
the truth.

40:04.489 --> 40:06.055
Wait here a minute, okay?

40:06.186 --> 40:07.622
Will you watch my bag?

40:11.931 --> 40:13.411
Hey.

40:13.541 --> 40:15.021
Everything okay?

40:15.151 --> 40:17.763
You're such a good kisser.

40:17.893 --> 40:19.329
That time you kissed
me in my apartment

40:19.460 --> 40:22.942
that started all this,
it felt so...

40:23.072 --> 40:24.378
good.

40:24.509 --> 40:25.858
Exciting.

40:25.988 --> 40:27.947
I needed that.

40:28.991 --> 40:31.777
And... you know me so well.

40:31.907 --> 40:34.519
That felt good,
too. Easy.

40:34.649 --> 40:36.608
[takes deep breath]

40:36.738 --> 40:39.306
You said maybe we're
different people now, but...

40:39.437 --> 40:40.699
I'm not.

40:40.829 --> 40:42.831
And I can't keep lying to myself
that I am.

40:42.962 --> 40:45.486
We could keep this
up for a while,

40:45.617 --> 40:48.794
but eventually
it'll fall apart, and...

40:48.924 --> 40:52.058
we'll both just be hurt again,
and our son

40:52.188 --> 40:53.929
will be confused
and upset.

40:56.671 --> 40:58.281
It stops now.

40:58.412 --> 41:00.022
Taylor...

41:01.546 --> 41:03.678
I'll see you next
week for drop-off.

41:03.809 --> 41:05.506
[sighs]

41:06.855 --> 41:08.683
Let's go home.

41:11.556 --> 41:13.383
[door opens]

41:13.514 --> 41:16.909
How was the first
voyage outdoors?

41:17.039 --> 41:19.302
Good.

41:19.433 --> 41:20.956
Turns out
I like being outside.

41:21.087 --> 41:22.349
Might do it again tomorrow.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.612
Who knows, could become a habit.

41:24.743 --> 41:26.701
I'm glad to hear it.

41:26.832 --> 41:29.269
So, how are you doing...

41:29.399 --> 41:33.621
she asked the angry man
with the big knife.

41:33.752 --> 41:35.493
Still angry.

41:35.623 --> 41:37.146
But I'm working on it.

41:38.147 --> 41:39.148
That's good.

41:39.279 --> 41:41.150
So, my plan for this evening

41:41.281 --> 41:43.196
Mm-hmm.
is to take
this delicious watermelon

41:43.326 --> 41:46.678
and, uh, share it with
our delightful daughter Astrid

41:46.808 --> 41:48.767
while we watch Wonder Pets!

41:48.897 --> 41:52.074
Mm. Well, that sounds like
excellent therapy.

41:52.205 --> 41:54.294
Well, I do have
that psychology degree.

41:55.730 --> 41:57.297
Hey.

42:00.082 --> 42:02.520
It's gonna be okay.

42:02.650 --> 42:05.131
I know.

42:05.261 --> 42:06.741
Thank you.

42:14.183 --> 42:16.534
[calls]:
Astrid? Mama's home.

42:24.846 --> 42:26.892
[exhales]

42:28.981 --> 42:31.157
Okay, here it comes, kiddo!
