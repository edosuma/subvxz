WEBVTT

00:04.797 --> 00:07.883
Well, sir, looks like
it's time for me to begin
my long overdue vacation.

00:08.383 --> 00:10.552
Vacation?

00:10.594 --> 00:12.680
Uh, a little heads-up
would have been nice.

00:12.721 --> 00:15.390
I've e-mailed you daily,
left you dozens
of voicemails,

00:15.432 --> 00:17.810
and for the last six weeks,
there's been this.

00:22.147 --> 00:24.274
I can't decipher
your cryptic clues.

00:26.025 --> 00:28.779
Anyway, here's your schedule
for while I'm away, sir.

00:28.821 --> 00:30.781
"Shedule." Bless you.
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

00:33.826 --> 00:34.994
Mmm-hmm.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.288
All right,
this seems doable.

00:38.330 --> 00:39.790
Sir, we both know
the paper is blank.

00:41.291 --> 00:42.960
You have no meetings,
no calls,

00:43.002 --> 00:44.962
nothing to do.

00:45.004 --> 00:46.463
Can you e-mail me
this as well?

00:47.673 --> 00:49.717
Of course, sir.

00:49.758 --> 00:51.050
So you're going
on vacation, huh?

00:51.092 --> 00:52.887
A little vacay action.

00:52.928 --> 00:54.847
Where's it gonna be?
Florida?

00:54.889 --> 00:56.473
Bahamas?

00:56.515 --> 00:58.517
(STUTTERING)
Virgin Islands, hmm?

00:59.727 --> 01:01.603
I'm not telling you
where I'm going.

01:01.645 --> 01:03.188
If I do,
you'll show up.

01:05.106 --> 01:06.525
Why would I do that?

01:06.567 --> 01:08.276
Because the one other time
I took a vacation,

01:08.318 --> 01:09.528
I told you
where I was going,

01:09.570 --> 01:10.654
and you showed up.

01:11.947 --> 01:14.616
That was a coincidence.

01:14.658 --> 01:16.284
Worst vacation of my life.

01:16.326 --> 01:18.453
I can't believe
you dragged me there.

01:18.495 --> 01:21.790
I didn't drag you...
Or in...

01:21.832 --> 01:24.334
Anyway, as much
as you've come
to depend on me,

01:24.376 --> 01:25.753
I'm sure you'll be fine.

01:25.794 --> 01:27.254
(EXCLAIMS INCREDULOUSLY)
I depend on you?

01:28.129 --> 01:29.673
Wow, that's hysterical.

01:29.715 --> 01:31.717
I have plenty to do
around here.

01:31.759 --> 01:34.720
Yes, this city is full
of barely legal girls

01:34.762 --> 01:36.680
down on their luck,
thinking life
can't get any worse.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.099
Go prove them wrong.

01:41.476 --> 01:42.937
You know, you can't leave

01:42.978 --> 01:44.312
until you get someone
to cover your desk.

01:44.354 --> 01:45.773
Very well, sir.

01:50.193 --> 01:51.695
Oh, will there
be anything else?

01:51.737 --> 01:54.114
Yeah, can you CC
the new guy my "shedule"?

01:59.954 --> 02:02.706
♪ How many ways
to say I love you?

02:05.333 --> 02:08.420
♪ How many ways
to say that I'm not scared?

02:09.922 --> 02:14.843
♪ With you by my side
there is no denying

02:14.885 --> 02:17.805
♪ I can't wait
for me and you ♪

02:28.607 --> 02:30.442
Oh, yes.
Oh, come on.

02:30.484 --> 02:31.902
What is that?

02:31.944 --> 02:33.988
It's his artificial
seasoning salt.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.908
I've developed an immunity
to regular salt.

02:39.242 --> 02:41.620
Apparently he's on
a quest to become
uninsurable.

02:42.287 --> 02:43.455
Hey...

02:44.081 --> 02:45.666
It's worth it.

02:45.707 --> 02:47.126
It really wakes up
the flavor.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.293
Mmm!

02:49.711 --> 02:52.213
All right, this stuff
is pure MSG.

02:52.255 --> 02:54.341
Uh, honey,
I'm an adult.

02:54.382 --> 02:56.093
Okay, you don't have
to spell things
in front of me.

02:58.470 --> 03:00.347
It stands for
monosodium glutamate.

03:00.388 --> 03:01.640
(SCOFFS) Nerd alert.

03:06.020 --> 03:08.605
You know,
Adam and I are taking
a healthy cooking class.

03:08.647 --> 03:10.732
Mmm-hmm, not my first.

03:10.774 --> 03:12.567
Tell 'em
what I made you.

03:12.609 --> 03:14.193
He carved a radish
into a rose.

03:14.235 --> 03:15.654
Aw.
(GIGGLES)

03:16.905 --> 03:19.033
Hey, you two should
take a class with us.

03:19.074 --> 03:20.492
Oh, that sounds fun.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.077
Based on
previous behavior,
I'm sure my husband

03:22.119 --> 03:23.745
will be eager
to participate.

03:25.246 --> 03:27.499
I'm not gonna pay
to watch this knob
carve a radish.

03:30.169 --> 03:32.129
Come on, we never
do anything together.

03:32.171 --> 03:34.715
Last night,
we watched TV
in separate rooms.

03:34.756 --> 03:36.550
I wanted to watch
The Mentalist.

03:36.591 --> 03:38.510
I was watching
The Mentalist...

03:41.638 --> 03:42.931
All right, you know what?
That's it.

03:42.973 --> 03:45.184
We're doing this.
We're taking
that cooking class.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.393
JEFF: All right,
we'll do this together.

03:46.434 --> 03:48.020
But next week,
I get the big TV
for  The Mentalist.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.360
(SIGHS)

03:59.073 --> 04:00.448
Hey, ferny,
I'm not mad,

04:00.490 --> 04:01.783
but in the future,
could you... Hey!

04:02.910 --> 04:04.953
Timmy's back!

04:04.995 --> 04:06.621
Seems about right.

04:06.663 --> 04:08.749
Took me two weeks
with you to die
inside as well.

04:11.543 --> 04:13.461
So how was
the vacation?
Where'd you go?

04:13.503 --> 04:15.130
I went to Chicago, sir.

04:15.172 --> 04:16.882
Ah, Mile High City.

04:17.716 --> 04:19.218
Nation's capital.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.719
Paul Revere and so forth.

04:23.180 --> 04:24.431
0 for 3, sir.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.601
So you seem
to have held up well.

04:27.642 --> 04:29.519
Oh, yeah.
Things went pretty well
while you were gone.

04:29.561 --> 04:31.105
I met a nice little
lady friend.

04:31.146 --> 04:33.398
Oh, good for you, sir.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.900
And just for
record keeping,

04:34.942 --> 04:36.860
did you expense her
or use petty cash?

04:38.528 --> 04:40.530
No, no,
she was a non-pro.

04:40.572 --> 04:43.366
In fact, something special
about this one.

04:43.408 --> 04:45.202
Oh.
She's very...
Oh, here she is.

04:45.244 --> 04:46.620
Radha! Hey, babe.

04:46.661 --> 04:48.705
Come on in.
This is Timmy.

04:48.747 --> 04:50.665
Timmy, this is Radha.
And she knows English,
you don't have to be all,

04:50.707 --> 04:52.000
"Nur-nur, nur-nur,
nur-nur."

04:53.794 --> 04:54.962
Pleased to meet you.

04:55.003 --> 04:57.005
Ah, a British accent.

04:57.047 --> 04:59.091
Yeah, just like you.

04:59.133 --> 05:00.842
(IN BRITISH ACCENT) "Oi!
Sweep the chimney, Governor."

05:01.969 --> 05:03.511
"A little shrimp
on the Barbie."

05:04.721 --> 05:07.182
"Who's been
eatin' me bowl
of Lucky Charms?"

05:09.059 --> 05:11.145
Another huge
swing and a miss, sir.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.606
So do tell,
how did you two meet?

05:14.648 --> 05:17.234
Well, I work
at a restaurant
on 6th Street.

05:17.276 --> 05:18.485
6th Street?

05:19.402 --> 05:20.612
You went
to Indian Row, sir?

05:21.280 --> 05:22.781
Ah, I had a hankerin'.

05:24.950 --> 05:28.203
By the way, Timmy, uh,
can you print out my
schedule for the week?

05:28.245 --> 05:29.955
Yes, just take
any sheet of paper
out of the printer, sir.

05:32.207 --> 05:33.500
BRB.

05:34.668 --> 05:35.710
Oh, hey, Timmy.

05:36.170 --> 05:37.296
Lady Timmy.

05:43.510 --> 05:46.096
Now in healthy kitchen,
we say goodbye to salt,

05:47.014 --> 05:48.807
we say goodbye
to butter...

05:50.309 --> 05:52.269
We should say goodbye
to this class.

05:52.311 --> 05:53.854
Would you stop it?

05:53.895 --> 05:55.522
Oh, no,
that's all right.

05:55.563 --> 05:56.857
It looks like
we've found
our class clown.

05:56.898 --> 05:59.151
Everyone, say, "Hi"
to the class clown.

05:59.193 --> 06:00.944
ALL: Hi.

06:00.986 --> 06:02.237
Ugh.

06:04.614 --> 06:05.866
I look the most
like a chef.

06:07.659 --> 06:09.119
I don't know
that that's important.

06:09.161 --> 06:10.287
It is.

06:12.164 --> 06:14.624
Tomorrow,
we'll be making
free-range coq au vin

06:14.666 --> 06:16.668
with low-fat
potatoes au gratin.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.419
But tonight
is all about prep work.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.005
Now, does anyone know
how to prep a chicken?

06:20.047 --> 06:20.964
I do, chef.

06:21.923 --> 06:24.425
Just calm down,
Wolfgang Suck.

06:26.385 --> 06:28.096
Okay, but before
we prep the chicken,

06:28.138 --> 06:29.931
we are gonna
slice the cheddar.

06:29.973 --> 06:33.476
So just to be clear,
you're asking
the entire class to, uh...

06:34.269 --> 06:35.645
Cut the cheese?

06:42.527 --> 06:44.571
Wow, Adam,
you were not kidding

06:44.612 --> 06:46.073
about having
done this before.

06:46.114 --> 06:47.448
Thank you, chef.

06:48.033 --> 06:49.201
(KISSING)

06:51.661 --> 06:52.913
You're jealous.

06:52.954 --> 06:54.664
Hey, chef.

06:54.706 --> 06:55.957
What do you think
of that mess?

06:58.293 --> 07:00.212
Well, you know,
considering you're
a beginner, it's...

07:00.837 --> 07:02.964
It's not good.

07:03.006 --> 07:05.967
Did you even use a knife,
or just your fists?

07:06.009 --> 07:08.970
(CHUCKLING)
That's a good one,
chef.

07:09.012 --> 07:12.391
All right, just tell me,
am I going home alone
tonight, or...

07:12.432 --> 07:14.309
Okay, let's all bring
our pans to the back.

07:14.351 --> 07:15.769
(SIGHING) I'll take it.

07:15.810 --> 07:17.062
I see an open bottle
of wine back there.

07:18.521 --> 07:20.357
Hey, hang in there,
buddy.

07:20.399 --> 07:21.649
You'll get the hang of it.

07:21.691 --> 07:24.361
Uh, no, I won't,
because I don't
give a crap.

07:24.403 --> 07:25.320
This is stupid.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.199
That's typical.
You can't do it,
so you put it down.

07:29.241 --> 07:30.658
Oh, please.
If I tried,

07:30.700 --> 07:32.702
our dish would
kick your dish's ass.

07:32.744 --> 07:34.288
(CHUCKLES)
Oh, really,
is that right?

07:34.329 --> 07:35.747
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah?

07:35.789 --> 07:37.582
Yeah, you wanna dance?
Let's dance.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.667
Sure.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.669
I mean, maybe after class
we could hit up a salsa club.

07:43.338 --> 07:45.090
No. I mean,
tomorrow night

07:45.132 --> 07:46.883
we have chef Brad
judge our food,

07:46.925 --> 07:48.676
see which one
tastes better.
Oh, all right, fine.

07:48.718 --> 07:50.387
And how about loser
pays for the winner's class?

07:50.429 --> 07:51.888
Done.
Done.

07:51.930 --> 07:52.931
Uh, hey, uh, teach?

07:54.182 --> 07:56.726
Uh, tomorrow night,
could you judge us?

07:56.768 --> 07:58.019
I'm actually
doing that right now.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.731
I meant, could you
judge our dishes,

08:01.773 --> 08:03.150
tell us which one
tastes better?

08:03.191 --> 08:05.277
Oh, that sounds like fun.

08:05.319 --> 08:06.694
Actually, you know,
I was once asked
to be a judge on...

08:06.736 --> 08:08.113
Super, all right.

08:14.244 --> 08:17.456
Ah, Mr. Dunbar, Radha.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.540
Ah, he caught us
on a little R and R...

08:19.582 --> 08:21.460
Russell and Radha.
(CHUCKLES)

08:23.044 --> 08:23.962
I'll never tire of that.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.466
Oh, um, he prefers
his fries...

08:27.507 --> 08:28.549
Much less crispy.

08:29.050 --> 08:30.469
Yes, uh...

08:30.510 --> 08:31.636
BOTH: His teeth
are very sensitive.

08:33.096 --> 08:34.306
Hey, that's my cross
to bear.

08:34.348 --> 08:35.807
Timmy knows.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.476
He's the one
who has to soak
my Doritos every day.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.560
Hmm.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.396
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Will you excuse me?

08:41.438 --> 08:42.939
Of course.

08:45.108 --> 08:46.985
Oh, my God.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.363
So hot the way
she takes care of me.

08:51.948 --> 08:53.367
Hot?

08:53.408 --> 08:54.868
Yeah, totally.

08:54.909 --> 08:57.371
I mean, between that,
her fancy accent,

08:57.412 --> 08:59.206
her exotic brown skin...

08:59.247 --> 09:01.249
Dude, I could not
be more into her.

09:08.756 --> 09:11.426
And those things
specifically are what
you like about her?

09:13.136 --> 09:14.346
Who knew I had a type?

09:16.890 --> 09:18.766
Yes. Who knew?

09:31.571 --> 09:33.823
Why are you
smashing tomatoes?

09:34.741 --> 09:36.284
Uh, I'm practicing.

09:36.326 --> 09:38.119
If we're gonna
take a cooking class,
let's do it right.

09:39.371 --> 09:40.788
Really?

09:40.830 --> 09:42.249
You're gonna stop
half-assing it?

09:42.290 --> 09:43.875
Yep, tomorrow
I'm going full ass.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.754
Why are you suddenly
into the cooking class?

09:47.795 --> 09:49.464
Well, I realized
you were right,
you know?

09:49.506 --> 09:50.965
We should be able
to enjoy things together.

09:53.801 --> 09:55.387
(CHUCKLES)

09:56.555 --> 09:58.223
Okay,
let's take that again.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.891
Why are you suddenly
into the cooking class?

10:01.435 --> 10:02.561
Because I made
a bet with Adam

10:02.602 --> 10:03.811
that we could cook
better than them.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.439
Oh, God.

10:05.480 --> 10:06.856
Come on, Aud. I'm
just trying to make
it more interesting.

10:06.898 --> 10:07.982
Why would you do that?

10:08.024 --> 10:08.900
Because it's
not interesting.

10:11.194 --> 10:12.653
It was fine, okay?

10:12.695 --> 10:14.239
The whole point
was for us to do
something together.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.032
We still are!

10:16.074 --> 10:18.118
We're gonna
destroy Adam
and Jen...

10:19.994 --> 10:21.162
Together.

10:23.373 --> 10:25.417
You know what?
Forget it. I'm out.

10:25.459 --> 10:27.877
I just wanted to learn
to cook with my husband,

10:27.919 --> 10:29.463
not destroy our friends.

10:30.088 --> 10:31.423
We can do both!

10:33.508 --> 10:34.717
Together!

10:39.722 --> 10:41.724
Hey, big Jeff.
Hey.

10:41.766 --> 10:42.725
This is Radha.
Radha, this is Jeff.

10:42.767 --> 10:43.726
Hello.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.107
Is this a goof?

10:51.610 --> 10:53.236
No, this is my
new lady friend.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.697
Um...

10:56.739 --> 10:58.658
Seems you've changed
your hair, Radha.

10:58.699 --> 11:00.034
Oh, yes.
I had been thinking

11:00.076 --> 11:01.328
of doing something
new with it,

11:01.369 --> 11:03.037
and Russell suggested
I go short.

11:06.458 --> 11:07.708
Did he now?

11:09.002 --> 11:11.212
Doesn't she look
adorable and amazing?

11:12.464 --> 11:13.756
I am amazed.

11:15.425 --> 11:16.801
There you go, babe.
Thank you.

11:25.977 --> 11:27.686
Babe,

11:27.728 --> 11:29.022
you look so sexy
with those glasses.

11:32.150 --> 11:33.401
Seriously.

11:36.613 --> 11:37.989
It's such a guy
thing to turn

11:38.031 --> 11:39.907
even a cooking class
into a competition.

11:39.949 --> 11:41.700
Well, I'm sure
it was Jeff's idea.
(SIGHS)

11:41.742 --> 11:42.952
The other night,
he bet me

11:42.994 --> 11:44.829
he could draw
a better bath
than I could.

11:45.330 --> 11:46.289
Did he?

11:46.623 --> 11:47.582
Yes.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.545
Well, don't worry.
We would never make you
pay for our cooking class.

11:52.546 --> 11:54.005
Well, I mean...

11:54.047 --> 11:55.131
You mean if you
were to win, right?

11:55.714 --> 11:56.757
"If"?

11:57.842 --> 11:59.718
What, you don't
think we could win?

11:59.760 --> 12:01.095
Well, we've been
to your dinner parties.

12:02.805 --> 12:04.391
Oh, I'm kidding.
No!

12:05.433 --> 12:07.185
Of course.
I know you are.

12:09.646 --> 12:11.356
I'm in.
Let's take 'em down.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.150
Nice.

12:23.284 --> 12:24.911
All right, we got this.

12:24.952 --> 12:26.246
Yeah, we do.

12:26.287 --> 12:28.039
We're a team.
That's right.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.874
Hands in,
team Bingham on three.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.544
I'm not doing that.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.385
(FAKING SNEEZE) A tool.

12:42.721 --> 12:44.055
Hey,

12:44.097 --> 12:45.764
I think we're
gonna be okay.

12:45.806 --> 12:46.849
It sounds like Jeff's
getting a cough.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.603
BRAD: All right,

12:49.644 --> 12:51.812
you've got
your ingredients
and your recipes.

12:51.854 --> 12:53.523
Now let's prove
that we can all make

12:53.565 --> 12:55.400
a yummy and healthy
coq au vin.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.402
Here you go, buddy.

12:59.529 --> 13:02.156
Are you trying
to bribe me?

13:02.198 --> 13:04.200
Absolutely not.
I'm just thanking you
for teaching us

13:04.242 --> 13:05.493
how to make the best dish.

13:06.745 --> 13:07.579
(MOUTHING) Right.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.916
That hurt.
I had a lot
riding on that.

13:13.834 --> 13:15.836
Well, good thing
you used a five.

13:22.801 --> 13:23.762
Uh!

13:31.478 --> 13:32.437
No!

13:42.989 --> 13:44.240
(SNIFFLING)

14:04.344 --> 14:05.637
Ooh!
(SCOFFS)

14:08.847 --> 14:09.932
Whoa!

14:32.497 --> 14:34.457
That was a wonderful
evening, Russell.

14:34.499 --> 14:36.376
And thank you
so much for
this jacket.

14:36.417 --> 14:37.836
What a thoughtful gift.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.879
Ah, you really like it?

14:39.920 --> 14:41.631
Well, I usually
prefer a more
feminine look,

14:41.673 --> 14:43.299
but I think
it works.
(LAUGHS)

14:44.175 --> 14:45.510
It works for me.

14:47.178 --> 14:49.138
May I check my e-mail
on your computer?

14:49.180 --> 14:50.765
Oh, uh, my computer?

14:50.807 --> 14:52.433
No, no, no. Uh...

14:52.475 --> 14:55.186
My computer's
actually running
a little slow right now.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.397
I think I got
a virus from some

14:57.438 --> 15:00.233
reputable, completely
work-related website.

15:00.274 --> 15:02.943
So why don't
you use Timmy's,
'cause he's cool with it.

15:02.985 --> 15:05.279
And I will go
troubleshoot mine.

15:10.284 --> 15:12.412
Ah, Radha.

15:12.453 --> 15:14.497
Timmy, I was just
checking my e-mail.

15:14.539 --> 15:16.207
Is that okay?
Of course.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.881
That's a very, uh,
handsome coat.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.884
Thank you.
Russell just
bought it for me.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.094
Huh.

15:28.720 --> 15:29.763
It looks like yours.

15:32.724 --> 15:34.517
Yes, well, nothing
rampantly unsettling
about that.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.395
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

15:37.437 --> 15:39.355
Will you excuse me?
Certainly.

16:01.586 --> 16:03.045
(WHISPERING)
I want you right now.

16:16.893 --> 16:18.770
(BELL DINGS)

16:18.812 --> 16:19.813
All right,
that is time.

16:22.398 --> 16:23.858
Well, this might
be the wine talking,

16:23.900 --> 16:26.110
but that does
not look good.

16:27.236 --> 16:28.446
There has
been a request

16:28.488 --> 16:30.657
for me to judge
two of our couples.

16:30.698 --> 16:34.243
Wow, that is
beautiful plating.

16:34.285 --> 16:35.495
Well, we wanted
it to be elegant
and not...

16:35.536 --> 16:36.621
Thank you, chef.

16:39.916 --> 16:41.292
Good, clean flavors.

16:42.418 --> 16:43.169
Excellent job, you two.

16:43.795 --> 16:44.629
Thank you, chef.

16:47.590 --> 16:49.008
Thank you, chef.

16:50.593 --> 16:51.511
(SHUDDERING)

16:51.886 --> 16:52.929
Wow.

16:53.638 --> 16:55.097
That is...

16:55.139 --> 16:56.223
Also on a plate.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.353
Ours is about taste
and not presentation.

17:00.394 --> 17:01.604
Yeah, yeah.

17:01.646 --> 17:03.815
It may not be
easy on your eyes,

17:03.857 --> 17:06.233
but it will be
easy on your mouth.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.404
Let's calm down
for a second.

17:14.868 --> 17:17.954
I see. Well
this has been
a tough decision,

17:17.996 --> 17:19.121
but I'm gonna go
with Jen and Adam.

17:19.163 --> 17:20.331
Whoo!
Ah!

17:20.373 --> 17:21.791
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

17:21.833 --> 17:23.250
You didn't even
taste ours.

17:24.669 --> 17:25.795
Busted.

17:27.505 --> 17:29.716
I guess there's
no more putting it off.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.053
Mmm!

17:35.346 --> 17:37.015
That is good.
That is very good.

17:37.807 --> 17:39.017
BOTH: Thank you, chef.

17:40.434 --> 17:42.520
There's a certain
creaminess,

17:42.562 --> 17:45.189
which is hard to coax
out of olive oil.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.649
We coaxed the crap
out of that.

17:48.317 --> 17:50.695
Well, I have
made up my mind.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.321
Jeff and Audrey win!
What?

17:52.363 --> 17:53.740
Yeah!
Yes!

17:53.781 --> 17:55.074
Come on, you son of...
No, look at theirs!

17:56.034 --> 17:57.785
True, yes, it...

17:57.827 --> 18:00.496
(STAMMERING)
It does look like

18:00.538 --> 18:02.415
a fetid pile of barf,

18:02.456 --> 18:05.543
but I was asked
to judge based
only on flavor.

18:06.377 --> 18:07.587
But don't worry, Jen,

18:07.628 --> 18:09.589
you do not have
to pay for our class.

18:09.630 --> 18:10.548
She's drunk.
Of course you do.

18:12.216 --> 18:15.177
And didn't I tell you
healthy cooking
could be delicious?

18:15.219 --> 18:17.304
Well, a student
is only as good
as his teacher.

18:17.346 --> 18:18.973
(CHUCKLING)

18:19.015 --> 18:20.307
Oh, you are
making me blush.

18:21.851 --> 18:23.310
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:24.562 --> 18:25.396
They used butter.

18:25.980 --> 18:27.065
What?

18:27.690 --> 18:29.233
(EXHALES)

18:29.275 --> 18:30.651
(ADAM STAMMERING)
What... What...

18:32.361 --> 18:33.863
So it turns out
you coaxed nothing.

18:34.530 --> 18:35.698
You just cheated.

18:35.740 --> 18:37.033
You can't prove that.
(SIGHING)

18:37.075 --> 18:38.659
Actually, I saw him
put the butter in.

18:41.454 --> 18:42.956
See, he proved it.

18:45.249 --> 18:46.208
You did not.

18:48.168 --> 18:50.880
Jeff, we...
We could have won
without butter.

18:50.922 --> 18:52.506
What, are you kidding?
I lost a band-aid
in that mess.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.301
Oh, my God.
Don't worry about it.

18:55.342 --> 18:57.219
It wasn't in
the bite you ate.

18:57.261 --> 18:58.387
(STAMMERING)
No, I'm, I'm...

18:58.429 --> 19:00.222
I'm having an
allergic reaction.

19:00.264 --> 19:02.767
To the butter?
Or the lies?

19:02.809 --> 19:05.352
No, I'm only
allergic to MSG.

19:05.937 --> 19:08.731
We did not use MSG.

19:08.773 --> 19:10.900
Are you serious?
You used MSG?

19:10.942 --> 19:13.111
Just a little,
teeny...

19:13.152 --> 19:15.488
Oh, actually
all of it.

19:15.529 --> 19:17.782
Oh, here come
the hives.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.450
(ADAM LAUGHING)

19:19.492 --> 19:21.786
Hey, you guys forfeit.
We win.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.288
Can somebody bring
me to the hospital?

19:24.330 --> 19:25.623
It would be
an honor, chef.

19:28.126 --> 19:30.461
I had a feeling that guy
would be leaving
in Adam's arms.

19:33.006 --> 19:34.340
We cheated...

19:36.009 --> 19:37.176
Together.

19:38.302 --> 19:39.553
(CHUCKLING)

19:46.268 --> 19:47.145
Good morning.

19:49.522 --> 19:50.523
Sir?

19:51.816 --> 19:53.317
It's nice outside today.
It's warm.

19:55.862 --> 19:58.072
Yes, unseasonably so.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.039
Sir, do you perhaps
think we should talk
about what happened?

20:06.080 --> 20:06.831
What's there to talk about?

20:07.999 --> 20:09.917
I was dating a hottie.

20:09.959 --> 20:12.045
You got weird,
tried to turn
yourself into her,

20:14.047 --> 20:15.798
and now she doesn't
talk to me anymore.

20:15.840 --> 20:16.757
Thanks a lot, buddy.

20:17.675 --> 20:18.968
That's your version?

20:21.888 --> 20:23.347
My version,

20:23.389 --> 20:24.348
because that's
what happened.

20:25.641 --> 20:26.851
Do me a favor.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.145
Let's not let
it happen again.

20:30.855 --> 20:32.439
Fine.

20:32.481 --> 20:33.649
I'll do my best, sir.
Okay.

20:33.691 --> 20:34.650
That'd be great.

20:37.528 --> 20:38.654
(SIGHS)

20:41.323 --> 20:42.533
Oh, hey, Radha.

20:42.575 --> 20:43.951
Can I have a chat
with your man?
