WEBVTT

00:17.875 --> 00:19.000
It's all happening, gentlemen.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.417
This is my wedding day.

00:21.834 --> 00:24.750
She's gonna be married
to someone she barely knows.

00:24.750 --> 00:26.250
What about Fran, is it weird?

00:26.250 --> 00:27.083
Hi.

00:27.542 --> 00:28.875
-No, I'm happy for her.
-JESSA: Cool.

00:30.208 --> 00:31.333
Okay, see you.

00:31.750 --> 00:33.041
SHOSHANNA: I've been living
in Japan for like

00:33.333 --> 00:36.166
seven months now
and it has seeped into my soul.

00:36.542 --> 00:37.500
Hot date tonight?

00:37.750 --> 00:39.917
He's quite famous.
Dill Harcourt.

00:40.750 --> 00:42.625
I have to go,
Hannah's having a gay emergency

00:42.625 --> 00:43.625
with her gay dad.

00:43.834 --> 00:45.959
Tell him I want
a fucking divorce!

00:45.959 --> 00:47.125
TAD: She didn't say that.

00:47.625 --> 00:50.125
DESI: I never dreamed
that you could be this cruel.

00:50.125 --> 00:52.542
MARNIE: I just don't know
who I am right now,

00:52.542 --> 00:55.041
but I don't want
to be married to you.

00:55.875 --> 00:58.250
I've wanted this
for a really long time.

00:59.542 --> 01:00.625
Me too.

01:02.542 --> 01:04.625
ABIGAIL: This is so hard for me
to say.

01:04.625 --> 01:06.458
We're managing you out.

01:06.709 --> 01:08.750
Will you just stop
so I can talk to you?

01:08.750 --> 01:09.458
No!

01:10.041 --> 01:12.208
I don't want to do this,
I don't belong with you,

01:12.208 --> 01:13.166
please go.

01:13.875 --> 01:14.792
Fuck!

01:14.792 --> 01:16.125
I love you.

01:18.667 --> 01:21.125
I'm looking
for someone special.

01:21.500 --> 01:22.875
And I'm not that someone.

01:22.875 --> 01:24.583
Are you with Adam?

01:24.583 --> 01:25.917
She knows. She fully knows.

01:26.125 --> 01:27.583
I can't really think
about Hannah right now.

01:27.792 --> 01:29.917
You're saying, that she's not
in our lives anymore

01:29.917 --> 01:31.208
doesn't work for me.

01:33.250 --> 01:34.250
You're writing again?

01:34.667 --> 01:36.291
I don't know,
but I have something to say.

01:36.291 --> 01:39.041
And you know what?
I can only control the mayhem

01:39.041 --> 01:40.583
that I create around me.

01:40.583 --> 01:42.667
(APPLAUSE AND CHEERS)

01:43.834 --> 01:44.834
That's all.

( music playing )

03:39.500 --> 03:41.250
Yeah, I just feel like
I'm, like, perfect

03:41.250 --> 03:43.291
for the aesthetic
of "Slag Mag," you know?

03:43.291 --> 03:46.417
Because it's like
my persona's very witty
yet narcissistic

03:46.417 --> 03:49.208
as you could probably tell
from my, like, triumphant
Moth monologue

03:49.208 --> 03:50.834
and resultant
"Modern Love" column.

03:50.834 --> 03:52.667
And the other thing
about me is, like,

03:52.667 --> 03:54.792
I give zero fucks
about anything,

03:54.792 --> 03:56.667
yet I have a strong opinion
about everything,

03:56.667 --> 03:58.542
even topics
I'm not informed on.

03:58.542 --> 04:01.458
And I have
to tell you that I read
your "Modern Love" piece,

04:01.458 --> 04:03.000
and, for me,
I was just fixated.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.667
I was like, what,
like, the fuck?

04:06.667 --> 04:10.291
Your best friend--
so-called best friend--

04:10.291 --> 04:13.333
and then your boyfriend
going at it.

04:13.333 --> 04:15.250
Just...

04:15.250 --> 04:17.709
And you just
have to sit there
and fucking take it?

04:17.709 --> 04:19.125
It's so fucking awful.

04:19.125 --> 04:21.000
How do you even
recover from that?

04:21.000 --> 04:24.333
I don't get how people
pick themself up
and keep going.

04:24.333 --> 04:26.667
It definitely was not easy,
and I definitely feel like

04:26.667 --> 04:29.834
I'm more of like
a dumpling than a woman
at this point in my life.

04:29.834 --> 04:32.667
Like a welcome mat
or a punching bag.
I mean, it's horrible.

04:32.667 --> 04:36.166
Anyway, I feel
so, so, so grateful
to be meeting with you.

04:36.166 --> 04:37.959
This is surreal.

04:37.959 --> 04:39.834
And you know what?
You don't even have
to sell me on you,

04:39.834 --> 04:41.500
because I already love
your writing.

04:41.500 --> 04:43.500
But even if I didn't,
I mean,

04:43.500 --> 04:46.834
we're basically hiring you
for your look.

04:46.834 --> 04:49.375
Amazing.
That's what I've always
wanted to hear.

04:49.375 --> 04:51.625
Yeah, your look
and your vibe,
your shape--

04:51.625 --> 04:54.542
I mean,
just your whole thing,
like, all that is you.

04:54.542 --> 04:56.542
You know?
I mean, this assignment,

04:56.542 --> 04:59.750
it's, like, stupid.
It's gonna be rad.

04:59.750 --> 05:00.792
Amazing.

05:00.792 --> 05:02.291
We're gonna
basically send you

05:02.291 --> 05:05.375
to this super chill
but also kind of disgusting

05:05.375 --> 05:07.583
female surf camp
in the Hamptons.

05:07.583 --> 05:09.333
Oh, my God, so I'm like
a millennial Gidget,

05:09.333 --> 05:10.959
who, by the way,
was a Jew,

05:10.959 --> 05:13.458
which nobody ever
wants to fucking
talk about.

05:13.458 --> 05:16.667
Well, she wasn't,
and that's not
the angle.

05:16.667 --> 05:19.667
What our vision is
is kind of we send you
out there,

05:19.667 --> 05:23.208
sort of bearing witness
to these bored, rich ladies

05:23.208 --> 05:26.041
who are taking
surf culture,
co-opting it,

05:26.041 --> 05:29.041
just turning it
into basically, like,
some shitty yoga,

05:29.041 --> 05:30.959
- which they've
already ruined.
- 100%.

05:30.959 --> 05:32.917
And then you look like
the opposite of a surfer.

05:32.917 --> 05:34.417
You're just kind of
wandering around,

05:34.417 --> 05:36.917
and, like, we just
throw you in the mix.

05:36.917 --> 05:38.500
It's so weird
how life works,

05:38.500 --> 05:40.208
because, like,
I never swimsuit shop,

05:40.208 --> 05:41.959
and I just bought
two new bathing suits.

05:41.959 --> 05:45.083
Also, I read
Shailene Woodley likes
to go to a private area,

05:45.083 --> 05:46.750
open her vagina,
let the sun in,

05:46.750 --> 05:48.250
and that's how
she gets her glow.

05:48.250 --> 05:50.333
So, when she goes to, like,
"Insurgent" premiere,

05:50.333 --> 05:52.583
that's not makeup,
that's sun in her pussy.

05:54.083 --> 05:56.542
( both panting )

06:00.917 --> 06:03.417
( moans )

06:11.917 --> 06:13.792
- ( sighs )
- And good morning
to you.

06:13.792 --> 06:17.083
Yeah, sorry. I just have
a million things going on.

06:17.083 --> 06:20.458
That's okay. I got a bunch
of reading-for-pleasure
to do, so.

06:20.458 --> 06:22.959
Oh, no, baby.
You got to go.

06:22.959 --> 06:25.583
Baby, I'm not gonna
be in your way.
Do your thang.

06:25.583 --> 06:29.709
No, I just--
I can't have you sleeping at
my place anymore every night.

06:29.709 --> 06:32.500
I've been talking
about this a lot with
my online therapist

06:32.500 --> 06:35.125
and she's, like,
obsessed with the idea
that this is just gonna be

06:35.125 --> 06:37.667
me getting back into
all of my old routines.

06:37.667 --> 06:39.291
I am in the middle
of a divorce right now,

06:39.291 --> 06:42.583
so this is not about you,
this is all about me.

06:42.583 --> 06:45.000
Okay, could I just
perception check
for a moment?

06:45.000 --> 06:46.709
Sure thing, baby.

06:46.709 --> 06:48.166
Are you asking me
to move out?

06:48.166 --> 06:49.250
Is that
what's happening here?

06:49.250 --> 06:50.500
Well, technically, no,

06:50.500 --> 06:52.291
because I couldn't
ask you to move out

06:52.291 --> 06:54.625
if you never moved in.

06:54.625 --> 06:56.333
Right, yeah, but I've been
staying here for months.

06:56.333 --> 06:57.667
Yes, and I love that.

06:57.667 --> 07:00.083
I love that.
I love spending
time with you.

07:00.083 --> 07:01.792
In fact, I want to spend
more time with you,

07:01.792 --> 07:03.917
but I just want
some of that time
to be apart.

07:03.917 --> 07:06.333
Ah. Okay.

07:06.333 --> 07:09.458
Sure, yeah.
I'll just crash
with Shosh, then.

07:09.458 --> 07:11.375
Baby, you live at Adam's.

07:11.375 --> 07:13.291
Technically, yes,
but, baby,

07:13.291 --> 07:15.792
that's one of the most
repulsive places you've
ever seen.

07:15.792 --> 07:19.166
Trust me,
it's a boundaryless hinterland
of sexuality and emotion.

07:19.166 --> 07:22.542
It's very disturbing,
and they're always somehow
reheating fish.

07:22.542 --> 07:25.166
Always. Like, they ordered
this huge fish dinner
months ago

07:25.166 --> 07:27.333
and it just...
never ends.

07:27.333 --> 07:28.667
It's bottomless.

07:28.667 --> 07:31.083
It's baffling.
It's haunting.

07:31.083 --> 07:33.709
I still think you should
try there first.

07:33.709 --> 07:35.792
I'll try Shosh's first
and see how it feels.

07:35.792 --> 07:37.667
Her manic energy
is not welcome here,

07:37.667 --> 07:41.291
so I just think
the only fail-safe way
to not bring that in here

07:41.291 --> 07:43.750
is to not live there.

07:43.750 --> 07:45.875
Well, I won't
bring her energy
into your place, baby.

07:45.875 --> 07:48.875
I'll just endure her energy
while I'm there,

07:48.875 --> 07:50.375
while preserving
my own energy.

07:50.375 --> 07:52.083
You're only human, baby.

07:52.083 --> 07:54.542
Okay, baby,
I'll just crash
at Adam's.

07:54.542 --> 07:56.250
I don't know,
it just seems so weird
to me that, like,

07:56.250 --> 07:58.208
they dated,
and now Ray's like,

07:58.208 --> 08:00.959
"Oh, no, of course,
I'm just gonna go live
with Shosh. It's fine.

08:00.959 --> 08:04.333
We get along so well
and our routines are
totally NSYNC."

08:04.333 --> 08:07.041
- Like, who does that?
- Well, Elijah and me,
for starters.

08:07.041 --> 08:08.709
Yeah, but you guys
don't even get along
that well.

08:08.709 --> 08:10.542
- Plus, he's gay.
- Elijah: I can hear you.

08:10.542 --> 08:12.667
Congratulations.
Now you know that
I think you're gay.

08:12.667 --> 08:13.959
Elijah:
You're gay.

08:13.959 --> 08:15.750
Well, maybe Ray
should move in
with you.

08:15.750 --> 08:17.208
Ew. No.

08:17.208 --> 08:18.750
That's a very nice thing
to say about your boyfriend.

08:18.750 --> 08:20.709
No, no, no.
No, this is
not about him.

08:20.709 --> 08:23.250
I love him.
I just can't
do that right now.

08:23.250 --> 08:26.000
I'm going
through a divorce.
Slow it down.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.458
You know what, Marn?

08:27.458 --> 08:29.542
That's surprisingly
and impressively mature,

08:29.542 --> 08:32.457
- and I'm gonna give you
some big kudos.
- Thank you.

08:32.457 --> 08:35.041
Aren't you glad
I didn't let you throw away
that halter top collection

08:35.041 --> 08:38.332
after you read
the "how to clean up like
a Japanese person" book?

08:38.332 --> 08:41.125
Literally so relieved.
You're an amazing friend.

08:41.125 --> 08:44.542
So, because I am such
an amazing friend

08:44.542 --> 08:46.709
and I am so respectful
of your space,

08:46.709 --> 08:48.417
I wanted to ask you,
personally,

08:48.417 --> 08:51.333
if I could use your room
while you're away.

08:51.333 --> 08:52.542
What for?

08:52.542 --> 08:54.917
Just a teeny,
tiny little orgy.

08:54.917 --> 08:56.750
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Fantastic.

08:56.750 --> 08:59.041
Oh, my G--
how many people
even come to an orgy?

08:59.041 --> 09:01.917
Well, I don't want to brag,
but Pablo only really
invites the elite,

09:01.917 --> 09:05.125
usually from the Broadway
sphere, so it'll be small,
probably like 15.

09:05.125 --> 09:07.208
I think it's gonna
be a really good way
for me to network.

09:07.208 --> 09:09.333
Why don't you just
take an acting class?

09:09.333 --> 09:11.333
Shut up, Marnie!

09:11.333 --> 09:13.625
Who do I look like,
Ryan Dillon Davidson?
Pff!

09:13.625 --> 09:15.125
I don't know
who that is.

09:15.125 --> 09:17.500
Yes, you do.
We went to Oberlin
with him.

09:17.500 --> 09:19.333
He was that annoying boy
who was always

09:19.333 --> 09:21.041
gaining and losing weight
for a role,

09:21.041 --> 09:23.250
and the role
was always chorus.

09:23.250 --> 09:26.709
That's who takes class,
Marnie, your dumb friend.

09:26.709 --> 09:29.166
That's who takes
fuckin' class!

09:31.834 --> 09:34.250
I don't think
you need to take
an acting class, baby.

09:34.250 --> 09:35.583
Elijah:
Thank you.

09:35.583 --> 09:37.625
I'm gonna fuck my way
to the middle.

10:00.542 --> 10:01.750
I guess it's just

10:01.750 --> 10:03.333
I wouldn't have
signed up for the camp

10:03.333 --> 10:05.458
if I knew that Tamara
wasn't teaching this year.

10:05.458 --> 10:06.917
Like...

10:06.917 --> 10:08.917
( whispering )
she is an incredible
person.

10:08.917 --> 10:10.917
Employee:
Tamara's in Santa Cruz
on vacation

10:10.917 --> 10:13.166
with her family
this season.

10:13.166 --> 10:14.834
Woman:
Is there a way
I can contact her?

10:14.834 --> 10:17.166
I know she'd want
to hear from me.

10:17.166 --> 10:20.500
Facebook's a good way
to keep in touch.

10:20.500 --> 10:22.834
( softly )
I reached out to her,
like, 12 times on Face--

10:22.834 --> 10:24.375
Fuck this.
Fuck this!

10:26.542 --> 10:29.625
Wow, seems like there's
a pretty tangled web
of history there.

10:29.625 --> 10:31.542
And super lesbionic.

10:31.542 --> 10:34.041
Me, I'm just worried about
being able to swim out
to my board.

10:34.041 --> 10:36.041
Okay, but you
can swim, right?

10:36.041 --> 10:38.875
Because it's kind of,
like, a liability issue
if you can't.

10:38.875 --> 10:40.709
I can 100% swim.

10:40.709 --> 10:42.500
I have a fun
sense of humor.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.041
Great!

10:44.041 --> 10:47.500
Okay, well,
you can go up to your room,
loosen those joints,

10:47.500 --> 10:50.750
and we'll see you
in the parking lot
in about an hour.

10:50.750 --> 10:52.166
Great.
I'm not complaining,

10:52.166 --> 10:54.250
but she did get a tote
and I just got these papers.

10:54.250 --> 10:55.625
- I'll see you soon.
- Uh...

10:55.625 --> 10:58.375
Wear sunscreen!

10:58.375 --> 11:00.333
You're very pale!

11:05.166 --> 11:06.917
Fuck.

11:08.500 --> 11:10.125
Oh, God damn it.

11:36.250 --> 11:38.792
Oh, my God,
this is so cute.

11:46.375 --> 11:49.208
( car tires squealing )

11:57.291 --> 12:00.041
Yo, can you put it
in park this time?

12:00.041 --> 12:01.125
Yo, park.

12:01.125 --> 12:03.625
( gearshift thumps )

12:03.625 --> 12:05.917
( over radio )
♪ Hey, yo, I'm feelin'
like Ray Charles ♪

12:05.917 --> 12:08.917
♪ I got my shades on,
I don't know where
they are... ♪

12:08.917 --> 12:11.542
- Yo.
- Yo.

12:11.542 --> 12:13.333
Sweet board.
Sick.

12:13.333 --> 12:14.792
Oh, this is just foam.

12:14.792 --> 12:17.458
Cool colors, though.

12:19.125 --> 12:21.959
- You here
for the surf camp?
- Uh, yeah.

12:21.959 --> 12:23.792
The girl inside
told me to come out
to the parking lot,

12:23.792 --> 12:25.792
but she seemed
pretty, uh, dumb.

12:25.792 --> 12:29.125
Everyone here kind of
talks in this slow,
unintelligible way

12:29.125 --> 12:32.333
that borders on just, like,
Matthew McConaughey hell,
so I don't really...

12:32.333 --> 12:36.333
Right, okay, well,
I'm one of the instructors,
Paul-Louis.

12:36.333 --> 12:38.834
Oh, yeah.
Well, you have
a smart voice, so.

12:38.834 --> 12:40.542
But "Paul Louis"--

12:40.542 --> 12:43.500
asking people
to call you by two names,
very bold move.

12:43.500 --> 12:45.125
Oh, no, no.
It's one name.

12:45.125 --> 12:46.500
Like the French
Paul-Louis?

12:46.500 --> 12:48.375
Got it.

12:48.375 --> 12:50.333
Anyway, you want
to suit up?

12:50.333 --> 12:51.750
We're gonna head down
to the surf soon.

12:51.750 --> 12:53.166
I'm in
a bathing suit.

12:53.166 --> 12:55.291
Uh, wet suit.
It's behind you.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.250
- These?
- Yeah, one of those.

13:01.250 --> 13:03.333
- They're all clean.
- ( sniffs )

13:05.667 --> 13:08.291
Jesus!
Sorry, um...

13:08.291 --> 13:09.875
For what?

13:09.875 --> 13:11.250
For, um...

13:11.250 --> 13:14.083
I actually texted,
saying that I...

13:14.083 --> 13:16.709
needed to crash here
for a while and I might
come by.

13:16.709 --> 13:18.834
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
you did.

13:18.834 --> 13:20.667
I remember.

13:20.667 --> 13:23.291
- Yeah, but you didn't--
you didn't respond.
- Mm-mm.

13:23.291 --> 13:25.250
So, I assumed
you weren't here
or something.

13:25.250 --> 13:26.792
Mm-hmm.
( laughs )

13:26.792 --> 13:30.166
I live here,
so I just decided
to come anyway.

13:30.166 --> 13:32.041
- Wow.
- Hey, man.

13:32.041 --> 13:33.375
Oh, hey.

13:33.375 --> 13:34.625
Oh.

13:34.625 --> 13:36.375
Well, it's been
a minute.

13:36.375 --> 13:38.542
Yep...

13:38.542 --> 13:39.917
it has.

13:39.917 --> 13:42.375
Oh, uh,
do you need
any yogurt?

13:42.375 --> 13:44.375
Keep the brain
in your gut happy.

13:44.375 --> 13:47.208
- Okay, thank you.
- ( laughing )

13:47.208 --> 13:49.709
- What?
- You already
have a spoon!

13:49.709 --> 13:52.125
I know, I'm sorry.
I found it after--

13:52.125 --> 13:53.250
( squeals )

13:53.250 --> 13:55.917
- ( grunting )
- ( laughing )

13:55.917 --> 13:58.291
Jessa: Okay, okay!
We have company,
we have company.

13:58.291 --> 14:00.083
Hey.

14:00.083 --> 14:02.083
What's up?

14:02.083 --> 14:04.291
What's going on here?
Where's all my stuff?

14:04.291 --> 14:06.500
Well, we needed
a clearer space
for sex reasons,

14:06.500 --> 14:08.417
so we thought
we'd give you
your own area.

14:08.417 --> 14:10.417
So you put my stuff
in the corner?

14:14.375 --> 14:16.291
Oh, God.

14:16.291 --> 14:17.583
( sighs )

14:18.917 --> 14:20.750
So you just
jammed all my shit
in the corner?

14:20.750 --> 14:22.750
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, but it's by
the best widow.

14:22.750 --> 14:24.959
Mm-hmm.
And it's all organized.

14:24.959 --> 14:27.083
I mean, basically,
roughly.

14:27.083 --> 14:28.583
In that it's not.

14:28.583 --> 14:31.208
( laughing )

14:31.208 --> 14:32.792
Oh.

14:32.792 --> 14:36.458
Look, I'm gonna
have to crash here
for a while, so...

14:36.458 --> 14:40.083
I'm gonna have to lie down
where your vagina is.

14:40.083 --> 14:42.792
Yeah.
Right here.

14:42.792 --> 14:44.208
Same as always.

14:44.208 --> 14:45.458
Yeah.

14:45.458 --> 14:49.291
Ugh. I really don't
like this "yah-gurt."

14:49.291 --> 14:51.250
Let's go downstairs.

14:51.250 --> 14:52.709
You really don't like
this "yo-gurt."

14:52.709 --> 14:54.500
Jessa:
Yah-gurt! Yah-gurt!

14:54.500 --> 14:57.000
Sorry!
Sorry, sorry.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.875
That was so hard
to get on.

14:58.875 --> 15:00.709
I had to lube
the whole thing up
with motel conditioner

15:00.709 --> 15:02.000
just to get it
over my ass.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.125
Yeah, and that's
my wetsuit.

15:04.125 --> 15:06.625
Are you sure?
Because it was just hanging
over there with the others.

15:06.625 --> 15:08.667
No, except it's pink
and it has my name

15:08.667 --> 15:11.000
written in super large
letters inside.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.333
Oh... okay.

15:12.333 --> 15:14.291
I thought the brand
was Ginny.

15:14.291 --> 15:16.333
- I am so sorry.
- It's okay.

15:16.333 --> 15:18.709
Teo, why don't you get
the rest of the girls
down there?

15:18.709 --> 15:20.000
Ah, all right.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.583
Let's make our own
little paradise.

15:21.583 --> 15:23.250
Come on.
Let's go, let's go.

15:23.250 --> 15:24.792
Paul-Louis:
Okay, guys, guys,
guys, guys.

15:24.792 --> 15:26.250
I think this
is a misunderstanding.

15:26.250 --> 15:28.542
We can get this resolved
nice and clean, okay?

15:28.542 --> 15:30.000
We have more wetsuits
on the truck.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.750
Why don't you
take that off here,

15:31.750 --> 15:34.667
and you guys
can both get suited up
down at the beach?

15:34.667 --> 15:36.750
Is that okay?
All right?

15:36.750 --> 15:38.083
So, I should
take this off here?

15:38.083 --> 15:39.834
- Yeah, go ahead.
- Okay.

15:39.834 --> 15:41.333
That okay?

15:41.333 --> 15:43.333
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

15:43.333 --> 15:45.500
Okay, stop, you're--
( chuckles )

15:45.500 --> 15:47.500
You're supposed to have
a bikini on under that.

15:47.500 --> 15:50.333
Well, fuck me.
I did not get that
information.

15:53.166 --> 15:54.792
Paul-Louis: All right,
how's everybody feeling?

15:54.792 --> 15:56.291
- Good?
- Woman: Yeah.

15:56.291 --> 15:58.709
You good?
Looking good.

15:58.709 --> 16:00.709
A lot of you are gonna
remember this from last year.

16:00.709 --> 16:03.333
I know you will.
It was a blast, right?

16:03.333 --> 16:05.709
How's the hip?
You okay?

16:05.709 --> 16:06.917
Looking good.

16:06.917 --> 16:08.792
All right, so,
position on the board

16:08.792 --> 16:10.458
is one of the most important
things we want to establish

16:10.458 --> 16:12.041
right off the top, okay?

16:12.041 --> 16:15.000
So, ideally,
you want to have
your toes

16:15.000 --> 16:17.709
on the tail or just off
the tail of the board,

16:17.709 --> 16:19.375
chest up off the board.

16:19.375 --> 16:21.834
- Tits out, ladies.
- Mmm.

16:23.458 --> 16:25.375
And, uh...

16:25.375 --> 16:29.000
have the nice,
strong back muscles
engaged, here.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.792
Man, you yogis
got this down.

16:30.792 --> 16:32.959
- You show me up
every time.
- Mmm.

16:32.959 --> 16:35.083
All right, Laramy.
All right, we get the point.

16:35.083 --> 16:37.041
You're beautiful.

16:37.041 --> 16:40.083
So, engaging our back muscles,
and we're gonna be paddling.

16:40.083 --> 16:43.417
Just like we're swimming.
Nice and relaxed.

16:43.417 --> 16:44.792
Feel a wave coming.

16:44.792 --> 16:46.083
Hands on the rails

16:46.083 --> 16:48.417
and we're gonna pop up
on three.

16:48.417 --> 16:50.041
Okay, straight up
to a standing position.

16:50.041 --> 16:51.375
Try not to come
to your knees.

16:51.375 --> 16:53.917
So that's one, two,

16:53.917 --> 16:55.709
three...

16:55.709 --> 16:56.750
straight up.

16:56.750 --> 16:57.917
Good work!
Good work!

16:57.917 --> 16:59.458
The key is to stay low

16:59.458 --> 17:01.083
and remember to always look
where you're going.

17:01.083 --> 17:02.458
If you look down,
you're gonna fall down.

17:02.458 --> 17:03.625
That's what
I always say.

17:03.625 --> 17:05.375
Right?
Just like life.

17:05.375 --> 17:08.875
All right,
we're gonna drill that
a couple times, okay?

17:08.875 --> 17:12.000
Laramy, what's up?

17:12.000 --> 17:13.290
Show me what
you got, lady.

17:13.290 --> 17:14.959
I know you got this.

17:14.959 --> 17:16.416
Duh-duh-duh-duh!

17:16.416 --> 17:18.083
Boom!

17:18.083 --> 17:21.083
Nailed it!
Every time, you--

17:21.083 --> 17:22.165
ah!

17:22.165 --> 17:23.290
Beautiful.

17:23.290 --> 17:25.333
Real nice.
That's cute.

17:25.333 --> 17:28.000
Every time.
Goddamn star
of the sea.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.041
We got to get her
into some kind of
ocean circus.

17:31.041 --> 17:33.792
Okay, Hannah,
we gonna give this a go?

17:33.792 --> 17:34.917
Um...

17:34.917 --> 17:36.291
You got this.

17:36.291 --> 17:38.834
You wanna slide down
a little?

17:38.834 --> 17:40.333
Okay, you got it.

17:40.333 --> 17:42.458
Chest up.
Chest up.

17:42.458 --> 17:44.208
You got this.
Back muscles engaged.

17:44.208 --> 17:46.291
We start paddling,
just like you're swimming.

17:46.291 --> 17:48.458
Nice and easy.
We're just paddling.

17:48.458 --> 17:50.291
In that position.

17:50.291 --> 17:52.542
Yeah, but with
the chest up.

17:52.542 --> 17:56.709
So-- and paddling
with a forward motion.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.583
Paddle, paddle, paddle.

17:58.583 --> 18:00.542
That's good.

18:00.542 --> 18:03.792
Okay, that's enough paddling.
And then hands on the rails.

18:04.792 --> 18:06.417
Okay, now when
the wave comes,

18:06.417 --> 18:08.291
you're gonna push up
into a standing position.

18:08.291 --> 18:09.750
One, two, three, up!

18:09.750 --> 18:11.083
Pop up.

18:11.083 --> 18:12.667
- Okay, that's not bad.
- Fuck!

18:12.667 --> 18:15.291
- Oh, shit. You okay?
- Fuck. No, I'm not okay.

18:15.291 --> 18:18.917
No, I'm not okay.
It's my front arm.

18:18.917 --> 18:22.291
- Which arm's the fr...
- This front of this arm
is really injured.

18:22.291 --> 18:23.667
Okay, let me have a look.

18:23.667 --> 18:25.834
You look okay.
There's no grazes
or anything.

18:25.834 --> 18:28.333
Well, it's an internal injury,
so obviously you're not
gonna see anything.

18:28.333 --> 18:30.000
Uh-huh. You know what?
You'd be surprised.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.834
I've fallen over
on concrete.

18:31.834 --> 18:33.083
You'll be okay.

18:33.083 --> 18:35.041
Sand is a very
forgiving surface, so...

18:35.041 --> 18:36.625
- Okay.
- ...why don't
we get you back up?

18:36.625 --> 18:38.125
What am I gonna do
when I'm out in the water

18:38.125 --> 18:39.458
and I only have one arm?

18:39.458 --> 18:41.000
Um...

18:41.000 --> 18:43.625
Okay, Teo, why don't
we get her up to Nurse Laura,

18:43.625 --> 18:45.500
see if she can get
taken care of?
You okay?

18:45.500 --> 18:47.125
- Yeah.
- 'Twould be my honor.

18:47.125 --> 18:51.041
♪ We get it on
most every night ♪

18:51.041 --> 18:52.333
♪ And when that moon... ♪

18:52.333 --> 18:54.208
Ah.
( sucks in breath )

18:54.208 --> 18:55.959
Ooh, yeah.
That there's tender.

18:55.959 --> 18:57.375
That's the tender stuff.

18:57.375 --> 18:59.625
Fuck.

18:59.625 --> 19:02.417
You actually
can't really sprain
your front arm,

19:02.417 --> 19:05.208
so you should be all good
to head back out there.

19:05.208 --> 19:08.041
Okay, but I'm a little worried
because I'm, like, super itchy,

19:08.041 --> 19:10.875
specifically in my navel,
and I think I might have
sand lice,

19:10.875 --> 19:12.875
which I've heard
are highly contagious.

19:12.875 --> 19:15.166
There's no such thing
as sand lice.

19:16.709 --> 19:19.291
Okay, I really need you
to give me an excuse

19:19.291 --> 19:20.709
why I can't surf.

19:20.709 --> 19:22.125
Who's making you surf?

19:22.125 --> 19:23.333
My job.

19:23.333 --> 19:25.333
You're a professional
surfer?

19:25.333 --> 19:28.000
No, I'm a writer
writing about surfing.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.875
Although, what if the piece
was about how I went out
to the beach,

19:31.875 --> 19:34.500
hated it, went back inside,
and never came out.

19:34.500 --> 19:36.375
Could that be
an interesting angle?

19:37.583 --> 19:38.542
No.

19:39.583 --> 19:40.917
I don't really need these.

19:40.917 --> 19:43.166
This was all a charade.
I am completely fine.

19:43.166 --> 19:47.125
No shit. I'm just
surprised you're not
asking for opiates.

19:58.583 --> 20:01.041
That looks great,
Tammy.

20:01.041 --> 20:02.834
- ( Tammy giggles )
- Hey.

20:02.834 --> 20:05.750
- Careful.
- Cool wings.

20:05.750 --> 20:08.041
( seagulls screeching )

20:15.083 --> 20:17.125
What are you
gonna do after this?

20:19.792 --> 20:22.166
- Just stay in the pool?
- ( Tammy giggles )

20:22.166 --> 20:25.000
( inhales, exhales )

20:26.625 --> 20:28.792
( music playing )

20:34.291 --> 20:36.875
( exhales )

20:36.875 --> 20:39.250
- Paul-Louis: Yo, Sebastian.
- What's up, Paul-Louis?

20:39.250 --> 20:40.792
Hannah, right?

20:40.792 --> 20:43.625
- Hi, yeah.
- How's the front arm?

20:43.625 --> 20:45.083
You never made it
back out with us.

20:45.083 --> 20:46.500
Oh, it's really bad.

20:46.500 --> 20:48.333
It's like, basically,
like-- it's not broken,

20:48.333 --> 20:49.834
but it's not
not broken,
you know?

20:49.834 --> 20:51.667
Right.
I'm so sorry
to hear that.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.417
And with
the beach bugs, too.

20:53.417 --> 20:55.542
I think you may
be talking about
my sand fleas.

20:55.542 --> 20:58.667
And I don't know
how you got my private
medical information, so.

20:58.667 --> 21:01.542
Um, Nurse Laura and I
are pretty tight.

21:01.542 --> 21:02.792
S'up?

21:02.792 --> 21:04.500
Yes! Hey!

21:04.500 --> 21:06.750
That's my girl.
( laughs )

21:06.750 --> 21:09.417
- That's my girl.
- Did he not just
touch my arm?

21:09.417 --> 21:11.333
Uh, listen,
none of my business,

21:11.333 --> 21:14.000
but you'd probably
have fun in surf camp
if you'd just let yourself.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.500
- Everybody else does.
- You sound like my mom.

21:16.500 --> 21:19.333
I mean, it's like,
maybe I don't want
to enjoy things all the time.

21:19.333 --> 21:20.709
Maybe that's not my style.

21:20.709 --> 21:22.375
In fact, this job,
that's why

21:22.375 --> 21:24.667
I was selected for it--
to not enjoy surf camp.

21:24.667 --> 21:26.500
I just didn't know
I would...

21:26.500 --> 21:29.500
so thoroughly disenjoy
surf camp.

21:29.500 --> 21:31.333
Wow.

21:31.333 --> 21:34.125
Well, I can't say
I blame you.

21:34.125 --> 21:36.375
Long Island's
the wrong island.

21:36.375 --> 21:39.875
Surfing out here
is all just kook city--
posers, businessmen.

21:39.875 --> 21:43.291
I spend a lot of my year
teaching water skiing
up at Poseidon,

21:43.291 --> 21:45.375
- this resort
in the Bahamas.
- Oh, wow.

21:45.375 --> 21:46.792
Yeah, much more chill.

21:46.792 --> 21:49.458
So, you like it
out at Poseidon?

21:49.458 --> 21:50.542
Yeah.

21:52.375 --> 21:54.458
To be honest with you,
I'd rather be teaching
at Atlantis,

21:54.458 --> 21:57.667
but that's not
an easy gig to get.

21:57.667 --> 22:00.500
Hey, if I ordered
some more drinks and
charge them to my magazine,

22:00.500 --> 22:02.542
would you, um, want one?

22:03.709 --> 22:05.500
Yeah. Thanks.

22:05.500 --> 22:07.417
I love drinking.

22:07.417 --> 22:10.375
But I'm cool,
because I can drink a lot
and not be an alcoholic.

22:10.375 --> 22:11.875
Very, very dope.

22:11.875 --> 22:14.500
- It's tricky, but--
- But you got there.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.417
- Yeah.
- Awesome.

22:16.417 --> 22:19.291
Hey, can I ask you
a question on, like,
deep background?

22:19.291 --> 22:21.583
Have any of your female
surf instructor colleagues

22:21.583 --> 22:24.125
had sex with any of their
female students?

22:24.125 --> 22:26.250
Yeah, all the time.

22:26.250 --> 22:29.208
Sometimes we--
we all do it together.
( laughs )

22:29.208 --> 22:31.375
Cool. And it doesn't
get awkward with your
colleagues

22:31.375 --> 22:34.417
when you're trying to, like,
kind of keep it profesh?

22:34.417 --> 22:35.750
I don't think so.

22:35.750 --> 22:36.709

so amazing at rapping.

24:22.500 --> 24:24.417
- Thank you.
- It must be--

24:24.417 --> 24:26.709
- Takes a lot of practice.
- It's hard, right?

24:26.709 --> 24:27.959
Mm-hmm.

24:27.959 --> 24:29.834
Just gonna...

24:33.542 --> 24:36.667
Just gonna hit the lights
so Teo knows it's not
an invitation.

24:36.667 --> 24:38.083
For sure.
Yeah, cool.

24:38.083 --> 24:39.583
Let's keep Teo
out of here.

24:39.583 --> 24:41.917

whatever happens, it's--

24:43.583 --> 24:46.583
it's like-- it's like
hang ten, cowabunga.

24:46.583 --> 24:49.875
Let's...
take your shirt off
and put it...

24:49.875 --> 24:51.000
Yeah.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.500
...in the shirt section.

24:52.500 --> 24:54.000
Bye, shirt.

25:02.333 --> 25:04.709
- Put this up.
- Oh, yeah.

25:04.709 --> 25:07.041
Totally,
just totally.

25:07.041 --> 25:09.083
Yeah. Yeah.

25:09.083 --> 25:10.709
Ah, f--

25:10.709 --> 25:12.750
You know what?
My hip actually
just kind of

25:12.750 --> 25:14.542
- popped in a weird way.
- Yeah?

25:14.542 --> 25:15.709
- Yeah.
- Oh, okay.

25:15.709 --> 25:17.291
- Well, let's try this.
- Okay.

25:17.291 --> 25:19.542
- Let's-- if you turn around...
- Yeah, definitely.

25:20.750 --> 25:22.709
Definitely
gonna turn around.

25:24.291 --> 25:26.125
- Okay.
- Okay.

25:26.125 --> 25:28.333
- So, I'm gonna
go like that? Yeah.
- Right here? I got you.

25:28.333 --> 25:30.750
- Is that what--? Okay.
- I got you. In...

25:30.750 --> 25:32.792
- Help me, here.
- Okay.

25:32.792 --> 25:34.792

25:34.792 --> 25:36.417
- Paul-Louis: Is that okay?
- Hannah: Uh, yeah.

25:36.417 --> 25:38.000
- Paul-Louis: Is that good?
- I don't-- my--

25:38.000 --> 25:39.750
Paul-Louis:
Try getting your heels
around my shoulders.

25:39.750 --> 25:41.458
Hannah:
I don't think my body
can necessarily do that.

25:41.458 --> 25:45.000
That's like a-- I'm not
really flexible in that way.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.792
- Paul-Louis: Really?
- I mean, I am flexible,

25:46.792 --> 25:48.959
but this is more like
a Cirque du Soleil
type of thing.

25:48.959 --> 25:50.625
- Paul-Louis:
Yeah, those gals are wild.
- ( bed squeaking )

25:50.625 --> 25:52.417
Hannah:
Yeah, maybe that's
a little-- nope.

25:52.417 --> 25:54.083
- Paul Louis:
How about if I bounce?
- I can't do this.

25:54.083 --> 25:55.917
I'm so sorry.
I cannot, actually.

25:55.917 --> 25:57.709
It's not, like, ideal.

25:57.709 --> 25:59.917
- I'm much more flexible
than I am strong.
- It's okay.

25:59.917 --> 26:04.000
And it's like--
I just feel like my lung's
a little bit collapsing.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.208
- Okay.
- So, we just--

26:06.208 --> 26:09.083
- Lie down.
- Okay. Okay.

26:09.083 --> 26:10.542
- You know what?
- Yeah?

26:10.542 --> 26:13.291
- Just breathe.
- Okay.

26:13.291 --> 26:15.208
I'm breathing.

26:15.208 --> 26:16.792
I'm breathing.

26:16.792 --> 26:19.667
That's way better.
Thank you.

26:19.667 --> 26:21.500
Yeah,
that's just normal.

26:21.500 --> 26:23.625
That's better.

27:12.333 --> 27:14.375
- Do you want some coffee?
- No. Good.

27:14.375 --> 27:17.333
Definitely have coffee.
I bought it at, like,
a real coffee place.

27:17.333 --> 27:19.375
- Here you go.
- Shoshanna: Oh, yeah,
well, you know

27:19.375 --> 27:21.542
that he doesn't drink coffee
from multi-national
conglomerates.

27:21.542 --> 27:23.375
Yeah. I appreciate
the thought, though.

27:23.375 --> 27:26.000
Cool.
More for me.

Oh, wow.

Paul Krugman.

27:31.250 --> 27:33.917
I know, right?
You've really got your finger
on the pulse there, Krugman.

27:33.917 --> 27:36.458
- What's happening?
- Shoshanna: I know, it's like,
if I need a tip about

27:36.458 --> 27:38.750
what to talk about
at a dinner party
in 2005,

27:38.750 --> 27:40.625
I'll call you
on your flip phone.

27:40.625 --> 27:43.500
- Fuck you, Paul Krugman!
- ( laughing )

27:43.500 --> 27:46.750
Ray: Thank you for shedding
light on the most obvious,
self-evident bullshit

27:46.750 --> 27:49.083
that every halfwit
in the city already knows.

27:49.083 --> 27:51.291
Shoshanna: It's like,
"Oh, hey, Krugman, maybe
you should write an article

27:51.291 --> 27:53.250
- about, like,
women's inequality."
- ( yawns )

27:53.250 --> 27:55.250
- ( Ray laughs )
- Like, let's talk
about that.

27:55.250 --> 27:56.625

Oh, man.

28:13.333 --> 28:16.208
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, no.

28:16.208 --> 28:18.208
Oh, no.

28:18.208 --> 28:19.959
Don't feel bad.

28:19.959 --> 28:21.875
Those red fuckers
you were drinking

28:21.875 --> 28:23.291
are way stronger
than they seem.

28:23.291 --> 28:25.083
They make everybody
boot.

28:25.083 --> 28:27.083
It tasted like a Slushee
when I was having it.

28:27.083 --> 28:28.834
( laughs )

28:28.834 --> 28:31.750
You probably shouldn't
drink so many Slushees
either.

28:31.750 --> 28:34.583
Oh, shit,
that's a beast
of a sunburn.

28:34.583 --> 28:36.291
Ow.

28:39.333 --> 28:41.250
Probably not.

28:42.375 --> 28:43.458
Fuck.

28:46.375 --> 28:47.959
You okay?

28:47.959 --> 28:49.500
Uh, yeah.
I'm fine.

28:49.500 --> 28:52.834
Um, I don't remember
very much about
last night,

28:52.834 --> 28:56.041
but I don't feel
violated in any way,
so...

28:56.041 --> 28:58.333
- um, that's good.
- Nice.

28:58.333 --> 29:00.250
I'm just gonna, um,

29:00.250 --> 29:02.291
clean that up
and go back to my room.

29:02.291 --> 29:03.709
It's okay.

29:03.709 --> 29:05.625
I don't want you to be
all sick by yourself.

29:05.625 --> 29:07.291
You can stay here.

29:07.291 --> 29:09.000
Oh, no, it's okay.
I'm used to it.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.667
It's not a big deal.

29:10.667 --> 29:13.834
Oh, shit. You know what?
You've got a lot
of pubic hair.

29:15.083 --> 29:16.875
What the fuck
did you just say?

29:16.875 --> 29:19.500
No, I just noticed
because I've seen a lot
of different bushes

29:19.500 --> 29:22.000
around the world,
and that's just, like,
totally...

29:22.000 --> 29:23.667
it's its own style.

29:23.667 --> 29:26.000
For your information,
this is what adult women
look like

29:26.000 --> 29:28.291
when they're using
their pubic hair the way
that, like, whatever,

29:28.291 --> 29:30.667
the Lord intended,
which is to protect
their vagina,

29:30.667 --> 29:32.375
so thank you
for pointing that out.

29:32.375 --> 29:34.417
Yeah, it's dope.

29:34.417 --> 29:35.792
Thank you.

29:37.125 --> 29:39.000
What's the plan
for today?

29:39.000 --> 29:41.083
Probably just gonna,
like, go back to my room

29:41.083 --> 29:43.542
and write, and then
just, like, cry,

29:43.542 --> 29:47.125
not in, like, a sad way,
just more like in a "Sundays
in high school" kind of way.

29:48.208 --> 29:49.333
I don't really like
the beach.

29:49.333 --> 29:50.875
I'm more into, like,
my apartment

29:50.875 --> 29:53.041
and meatball shops
and libraries.

29:53.041 --> 29:55.417
Whoa. I thought
you just didn't
like surfing.

29:55.417 --> 29:56.917
You don't like
the beach?

29:56.917 --> 29:58.291
No, it sucks.

29:58.291 --> 30:00.166
The best part of the beach
isn't the beach.

30:00.166 --> 30:01.834
It's everything else.

30:01.834 --> 30:03.542
Like, what's the cure
for everything?

30:03.542 --> 30:04.959
Uh, penicillin.

30:04.959 --> 30:05.917
It's salt.

30:05.917 --> 30:08.458
Tears, sweat, the sea.

30:08.458 --> 30:11.041
Think about it.
I call it the big, blue
medicine pill.

30:11.041 --> 30:12.333
Well, I told you
I'm gonna sob,

30:12.333 --> 30:13.917
so I guess
I'm getting it done.

30:15.208 --> 30:17.417
You know what
I'm gonna do?

30:17.417 --> 30:20.375
I'm gonna tell Teo to handle
the other girls, and I'm gonna
show you around.

30:20.375 --> 30:22.959
That's a really sweet offer,
but you don't have to do that.

30:22.959 --> 30:24.542
And anyway, I'm here
on a journalistic mission

30:24.542 --> 30:26.917
that I kind of have to,
like, pursue on my own

30:26.917 --> 30:29.166
to get the energy
of Montauk.

30:29.166 --> 30:33.834
So, you can't hang out because
you're writing an article
about hanging out?

30:33.834 --> 30:36.750
I mean, if you
want to, like, show me
some inside track stuff

30:36.750 --> 30:39.041
that would, like,
make my editor happy...

30:39.041 --> 30:41.542
All right.
Cool.

30:41.542 --> 30:43.000

It's really...

31:21.291 --> 31:22.625
It's very hard.

31:56.834 --> 31:58.583
Fuck you!

32:00.500 --> 32:02.500

32:04.333 --> 32:06.875
- These kids are always
up to no good.
- Right.

32:09.458 --> 32:11.500
But Mr. Cooper's
there to help.

32:12.917 --> 32:14.333
Exactly.

32:18.583 --> 32:21.000
( coughs, laughs )

32:21.000 --> 32:23.166
You okay?

32:23.166 --> 32:25.208
( seagulls screeching )

32:28.959 --> 32:30.667
This really
is breathtaking,

32:30.667 --> 32:33.125
and that is not a word
I have ever used before.

32:33.125 --> 32:34.625
( chuckles )

32:34.625 --> 32:36.083
Yeah.

32:36.083 --> 32:38.458
When nature puts on a show,
you gotta come watch.

32:39.500 --> 32:41.000
Yeah.

32:42.875 --> 32:46.291
I just can't believe
that this is my life.

32:46.291 --> 32:47.500
You know?

32:47.500 --> 32:48.875
I'm just a dude
from Detroit.

32:48.875 --> 32:51.625
All my parents ever did
was yell at each other

32:51.625 --> 32:54.166
and turn the TV up
real loud.

32:54.166 --> 32:57.375
The neighbors
were always having kids,
kids were always crying.

32:57.375 --> 33:00.208
I didn't know what quiet
sounded like till I left.

33:00.208 --> 33:01.875
Even when I was
in my room, it was like,

33:01.875 --> 33:04.542
"Paul-Louis, Paul-Louis,
get out here."

33:04.542 --> 33:06.208
I'm from Michigan, too.

33:06.208 --> 33:08.083
- East Lansing.
- Oh.

33:08.083 --> 33:09.542
It was really quiet
where I lived.

33:09.542 --> 33:11.917
My parents used to forget
about me for, like, 72 hours

33:11.917 --> 33:13.083
while I was reading
in my room.

33:13.083 --> 33:14.542
Just, like,
not feed me and stuff.

33:14.542 --> 33:15.834
( laughs )

33:15.834 --> 33:17.709
I couldn't wait
to leave.

33:19.166 --> 33:21.583
You know, I've seen
a bunch of places--

33:21.583 --> 33:24.875
Panama Canal, Sweden,
New Zealand,

33:24.875 --> 33:26.250
Thailand, Wales.

33:26.250 --> 33:27.750
- Wow, Wales.
- Mm-hmm.

33:27.750 --> 33:29.583
So, you just, like,
wander full time.

33:29.583 --> 33:30.583
Yeah, pretty much.

33:30.583 --> 33:32.834
Bungee, parasail,
hike, kitesurf.

33:32.834 --> 33:35.750
Well, was there something
that you wanted to be
when you grew up?

33:35.750 --> 33:37.750
Like, a goal
that you had?

33:38.834 --> 33:40.583
Just whatever
my dad wasn't.

33:42.417 --> 33:45.250
God, I was so ready
to hate this.

33:46.333 --> 33:48.250
Why?
What's to hate?

33:48.250 --> 33:51.083
You know,
confusing ocean smells,

33:51.083 --> 33:53.083
watersports,
sand in my vagina.

33:53.083 --> 33:54.875
- What's not to hate?
- ( laughs )

33:54.875 --> 33:56.750
Yeah, but it's so much easier
to love something
than to hate it.

33:56.750 --> 33:58.083
Don't you think?

33:58.083 --> 33:59.959
Love's the easiest thing
in the world.

33:59.959 --> 34:01.458
Yeah, but, like,
all my friends
in New York

34:01.458 --> 34:03.041
define themselves
by, like, what they hate.

34:03.041 --> 34:04.875
Like, I don't even know
what any of my friends like.

34:04.875 --> 34:06.709
I just know
what they don't like.

34:06.709 --> 34:08.750
God, that's so crazy.

34:08.750 --> 34:12.125
It's like everyone's so busy
chasing success and, like,
defining themselves,

34:12.125 --> 34:14.458
they can't even
experience pleasure.

34:15.458 --> 34:17.792
It's what we're here for.

34:17.792 --> 34:19.917
Think about it.

34:19.917 --> 34:22.291
Hate takes energy.

34:22.291 --> 34:24.917
Love gives vibes.

34:24.917 --> 34:26.917
Yeah, love does
give vibes.

34:29.041 --> 34:30.625
Are you a Buddhist?

34:31.792 --> 34:33.291
I don't think so.

34:35.792 --> 34:37.667
You're a really
special person.

34:45.333 --> 34:48.500
So, I think that covers
everything we received

34:48.500 --> 34:51.291
from our
Bloomingdale's registry,

34:51.291 --> 34:52.542
which, frankly,
wasn't much

34:52.542 --> 34:55.792
because people
really cheaped out.

34:55.792 --> 34:59.834
Okay, well,
obviously, I'll hold on
to all the guitars

34:59.834 --> 35:02.709
and, you know, various
accompanying accoutrement.

35:02.709 --> 35:05.166
- What the fuck?
- What?

35:05.166 --> 35:06.667
Those pedals
are expensive.

35:07.709 --> 35:09.667
What, do you want
a pedal?

35:10.834 --> 35:12.917
You want
the Professor Mud Rucker?

35:12.917 --> 35:15.208
Oh, come on, Marnie,
you're better than that.

35:15.208 --> 35:16.500
Better than what,
Desi?

35:16.500 --> 35:18.291
Better than wanting
what's mine?

35:18.291 --> 35:20.166
I'm not keeping them
for me, Marnie, okay?

35:20.166 --> 35:21.458
I'm keeping them
for Marnie & Desi.

35:21.458 --> 35:22.959
Or are we not
a band anymore?

35:22.959 --> 35:24.625
I don't know.

35:24.625 --> 35:26.834
The tour was a total shit-show.
We didn't make any money.

35:26.834 --> 35:30.000
And anyway,
it was your weird
hippie-freak girlfriend

35:30.000 --> 35:31.542
that refused
to sell any merch

35:31.542 --> 35:34.709
other than the oil
that she blended
in a thermos.

35:34.709 --> 35:37.208
Desi, everyone knows
the money is in the merch.

35:37.208 --> 35:38.709
I know the money's
in the merch!

35:38.709 --> 35:40.625
And Tandace is not
my fucking girlfriend.

35:40.625 --> 35:42.625
She is my therapeutic
companion, Marnie.

35:42.625 --> 35:44.417
And you know this.
You know this.

35:44.417 --> 35:46.250
She's helping me
on a spiritual journey,
Marnie.

35:46.250 --> 35:48.083
You know that.

35:48.083 --> 35:49.417
She doesn't want
anything from me.

35:49.417 --> 35:51.041
She doesn't need
anything from me,

35:51.041 --> 35:53.458
except maybe my sperm sometime
in the next six months, okay?

35:53.458 --> 35:55.208
- Oh, my God.
- Okay? Okay?

35:55.208 --> 35:56.333
That is a good idea.

35:56.333 --> 35:58.750
Beware, my Lord,
of jealousy,

35:58.750 --> 36:00.208
for it is
a green-eyed monster

36:00.208 --> 36:04.041
that doth mock the meat
it feeds on, okay?

36:05.250 --> 36:07.542
( sighs )
Fuck!

36:07.542 --> 36:08.792
Why are we even fighting?

36:08.792 --> 36:10.583
We should be putting this
into the music.

36:10.583 --> 36:12.208
I can't do that
right now.

36:12.208 --> 36:14.041
I know that Fleetwood Mac
worked through

36:14.041 --> 36:16.583
some fucking serious
interpersonal strain, okay?

36:16.583 --> 36:18.458
But we are not
Fleetwood Mac.

36:18.458 --> 36:20.166
You should want
to be Fleetwood Mac.

36:20.166 --> 36:22.000
You should want
to be Fleetwood Mac.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.625
You should want that.

36:26.125 --> 36:28.792
I'll see you
around, kid.

36:28.792 --> 36:30.709
Okay, Desi, stop.

36:30.709 --> 36:32.709
I do want that.

36:32.709 --> 36:35.041
You know I want that.
I just...

36:36.291 --> 36:38.083
I don't know
if we can right now.

36:38.083 --> 36:40.166
I'm not feeling it.

36:40.166 --> 36:42.041
Fuck, I don't even think
I'm that talented.

36:42.041 --> 36:45.250
- I think I just decided
this was something--
- Hey! Hey!

36:47.750 --> 36:49.917
Before everything,

36:49.917 --> 36:53.000
before I even saw you
as a woman,

36:53.000 --> 36:55.125
I saw you
as an artist.

36:57.750 --> 36:59.792
You are a musical force.

37:02.083 --> 37:04.000
You are a musical force.

37:05.667 --> 37:08.166
Thank you.

37:08.166 --> 37:10.750
Thank you
for really seeing me.

37:16.709 --> 37:18.000
( sobbing )

37:18.000 --> 37:21.333
Fucking divorce
is fucking killing me!

37:28.250 --> 37:30.750
( distant seagulls
screeching )

37:30.750 --> 37:32.000
Hey.

37:33.542 --> 37:34.834
Hey.

37:37.834 --> 37:39.583
Ah.

37:39.583 --> 37:42.125
- Ah.
- ( both chuckle )

37:43.583 --> 37:47.166
I was thinking
maybe I should,
like, um--

37:47.166 --> 37:50.250
I don't know,
like, stay here
for a little while.

37:50.250 --> 37:52.709
- Yeah?
- You know?

37:52.709 --> 37:57.166
Like, maybe I can get,
like, an Airbnb in town
and write and hang out.

37:57.166 --> 38:00.667
And, like,
you and I can get to know
each other better, and...

38:00.667 --> 38:03.583
I should probably start
disconnecting from, like,
the toxic negativity

38:03.583 --> 38:05.166
of everyone
I thought I loved
in New York.

38:05.166 --> 38:08.041
So this would be
a good way to start.

38:08.041 --> 38:09.875
- Cool.
- Cool?

38:09.875 --> 38:11.375
Yeah, it makes sense.

38:11.375 --> 38:14.750
I mean,
nobody wants bad vibes
in their life, right?

38:14.750 --> 38:17.375
- Yeah.
- I mean, actually,
my girlfriend Ashlynn

38:17.375 --> 38:20.041
is getting here Friday,
so you can meet her.

38:20.041 --> 38:23.792
Your, um--
your what?

38:23.792 --> 38:25.458
My girlfriend Ashlynn.

38:25.458 --> 38:27.542
I know.
It's because
her dad is named Lynn

38:27.542 --> 38:30.291
and her mom was Asher,
hence the unusual name.

38:30.291 --> 38:32.083
Kind of have that
in common.

38:32.083 --> 38:34.208
She teaches hula
up at Atlantis.

38:34.208 --> 38:36.375
Yeah, she got
the big gig.

38:36.375 --> 38:39.583
We try and see each other
every couple of weeks
when I'm off.

38:39.583 --> 38:41.375
But, I mean,
I prefer to go there

38:41.375 --> 38:44.750
because they got
a fucking bungee
that goes into a shark tank.

38:44.750 --> 38:46.291
I mean, not man-eaters
or anything.

38:46.291 --> 38:49.542
Wait, so you're saying
that you have a girlfriend?

38:49.542 --> 38:53.041
Yeah, but, I mean,
we're open at the moment.

38:54.208 --> 38:55.542
I mean,
outside of the Bahamas,

38:55.542 --> 38:57.333
there's no real rules
between us

38:57.333 --> 38:59.083
except if we, like,
go on a trip.

38:59.083 --> 39:01.166
Like, next month,
we're gonna go Kilimanjaro,

39:01.166 --> 39:02.917
which is gonna be
a motherfucker.

39:02.917 --> 39:04.750
So, you, like, can't fuck
anyone on Kilimanjaro

39:04.750 --> 39:06.667
because you'll
be, like, with her,
so it wouldn't be...

39:06.667 --> 39:11.667
- Yeah.
- ...appropriate for you to fuck
someone on Kilimanjaro.

39:11.667 --> 39:13.417
Probably not.

39:13.417 --> 39:14.750
Great.

39:17.417 --> 39:20.208
Well, lucky I didn't
meet you on Kilimanjaro.

39:21.792 --> 39:23.542
( exhales )

39:23.542 --> 39:25.166
What's up?

39:25.166 --> 39:27.083
I don't know.
What's up, dude?

39:27.083 --> 39:28.583
( stammering )
Well, I didn't...

39:28.583 --> 39:30.375
Is that a problem?

39:30.375 --> 39:32.583
I didn't think
you were looking
for something serious.

39:32.583 --> 39:34.750
- I mean--
- I didn't say I was looking
for something serious.

39:34.750 --> 39:36.166
I'm here on assignment.

39:36.166 --> 39:38.959
I mean, don't, like,
put words in my mouth.

39:38.959 --> 39:41.625
That's so insane.

39:43.125 --> 39:45.125
Well, you just seem upset.
You seem mad.

39:45.125 --> 39:47.041
I mean, I...

39:47.041 --> 39:48.625
Hannah.

39:52.417 --> 39:54.625
( sighs )

40:00.959 --> 40:03.000
I'm really sorry,
Hannah.

40:05.208 --> 40:06.667
I'm sorry.

40:10.291 --> 40:11.291
It's okay.

40:11.291 --> 40:13.125
I mean, like...

40:13.125 --> 40:14.959
why get mad
at fun, right?

40:14.959 --> 40:16.291
( laughs )

40:16.291 --> 40:18.792
- Why get mad at fun?
- Yeah.

40:18.792 --> 40:21.041
- Why get mad at fun?
- No.

40:21.041 --> 40:23.208
But I don't really
want to be tickled.

40:23.208 --> 40:24.667
- I don't want
to be tickled.
- Come on.

40:24.667 --> 40:26.250
I'd really love
to not be tickled.

40:26.250 --> 40:27.667
I'd love
to not be tickled.

40:27.667 --> 40:29.166
Please.

40:29.166 --> 40:32.166
If you could just stop tick--
I am really serious.

Hi!

43:22.125 --> 43:23.208
DESI: Bella, join us.

43:24.166 --> 43:25.709
-Tonight? I have plans.
-Oh.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.834
And it's totally not your crowd.

43:27.834 --> 43:29.542
You think I have time to go
Poughkeepsie,

43:29.542 --> 43:31.625
to support her like, sick,
little tryst.

43:31.625 --> 43:32.500
Yeah, 'cause nothin' says,

43:33.083 --> 43:34.834
"Let's get this romance back
on track" like Poughkeepsie.

43:35.250 --> 43:36.500
Okay, I'm kinda freaking out.

43:36.500 --> 43:37.333
This is it?

43:37.709 --> 43:39.208
New York's best and brightest
we-men?

43:39.417 --> 43:41.000
Whole lot of pleather,
considering.

43:41.500 --> 43:43.166
-Where's my name tag?
-Ugh! No.

43:49.291 --> 43:51.208
I read Shailene Woodley likes
to go to a private area,

43:51.208 --> 43:52.458
open her vagina, let the sun in,

43:52.458 --> 43:53.834
and that's how
she gets her glow.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.041
Episode one,
"All I Ever Wanted,"

43:57.041 --> 44:01.125
is, uh, Hannah's, uh, foray
into vacation journalism.

44:01.625 --> 44:04.125
And it was a really fun way
to reset the season.

44:04.125 --> 44:05.875
We got to have that
little moment at home,

44:05.875 --> 44:08.709
and, um, we see that
Hannah's been having her...

44:08.709 --> 44:10.125
a little bit of writing success,

44:10.125 --> 44:11.375
and what that looks like
for her.

44:11.583 --> 44:12.792
You don't even have
to sell me on you,

44:13.041 --> 44:14.208
because I already love
your writing.

44:14.750 --> 44:17.917
But even if I didn't... I mean,
we're basically hiring you

44:17.917 --> 44:19.041
for your look.

44:19.041 --> 44:20.041
LENA DUNHAM: And then...

44:20.458 --> 44:21.583
sent her off
on a humiliating journey,

44:21.583 --> 44:22.583
our favorite combination.

44:23.041 --> 44:24.542
We ended up in Montauk.
It was great.

44:24.542 --> 44:28.000
And then we had this
awesome, fun guest cast.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.500
It was like we were living
in a different show

44:29.500 --> 44:30.583
-for a few days.
-Yeah, right.

44:31.083 --> 44:33.083
Riz Ahmed, who's amazing,
and obviously playing

44:33.083 --> 44:34.542
a very different role
then he played in...

44:34.542 --> 44:36.083
We were all obsessed
with Native!

44:36.083 --> 44:38.208
In my mind, he was the same guy.

44:38.208 --> 44:39.583
(ALL LAUGHING)

44:39.875 --> 44:42.166
Well, I'm one of
the instructors, Paul-Louis.

44:42.750 --> 44:45.417
Asking people to call you
by two names. Very bold move.

44:45.917 --> 44:47.792
-And then he is a rapper...
-DUNHAM: Yeah.

44:47.792 --> 44:49.125
-So, that was added.
-Yes.

44:49.417 --> 44:52.250
You know, Riz is also "Riz MC,"
so, we talked to him

44:52.250 --> 44:54.083
about memorizing
this Twista song.

44:54.083 --> 44:55.250
And he was like,
"I'll be right back,"

44:55.625 --> 44:57.166
and... totally came back
and was on it.

44:57.417 --> 44:59.709
-(HYPING) Yo! What's good?
-(CHEERING)

44:59.917 --> 45:01.166
And the idea of her going
into something

45:01.542 --> 45:02.917
with all her sort of
New York skepticism,

45:03.291 --> 45:04.709
and then letting that go,
and being able to, like,

45:05.000 --> 45:07.542
experience joy, was really what
we wanted to get.

45:07.917 --> 45:11.417
Yeah, I think it was, you know,
Hannah finding the beauty

45:11.417 --> 45:14.417
in, like, the simplicity
of nature, just the simplicity

45:14.417 --> 45:17.834
of the lives out there was,
like, a really funny idea to us,

45:17.834 --> 45:21.959
that, like, Hannah could go
un-cynical after all this time.

45:22.500 --> 45:26.166
I wanted to ask you personally
if I could use your room...

45:26.166 --> 45:28.125
-While you're away.
-What for?

45:28.583 --> 45:31.041
Just a... teeny, tiny,
little orgy.

45:31.250 --> 45:32.291
Yeah. Absolutely.

45:32.917 --> 45:34.417
I think it's gonna be a really
good way for me to network.

45:34.792 --> 45:37.250
When we find Elijah this season,
he's in a place of incredible,

45:37.250 --> 45:40.500
like, jealousy, spite,
and self-righteousness.

45:40.500 --> 45:42.542
Which is, like, he thinks
everyone's an asshole,

45:42.917 --> 45:46.125
everyone's untalented,
he's not properly recognized,

45:46.125 --> 45:47.875
and he's also not doing
anything about it.

45:47.875 --> 45:50.417
And I think a lot of Dill
telling Elijah last season,

45:50.417 --> 45:53.625
like, "You're not, um, ambitious
and you're not accomplished,"

45:53.625 --> 45:55.542
threw him into a real state.

45:56.125 --> 45:57.834
Why don't you just take
an acting class?

45:58.125 --> 45:59.125
Shut up, Marnie!

46:00.250 --> 46:03.625
In terms of where Marnie was,
we liked this idea that

46:03.625 --> 46:07.333
she has been dating Ray,
but there is some unrest.

46:07.667 --> 46:10.500
I know that Fleetwood Mac worked
through some fucking serious

46:10.500 --> 46:11.959
-interpersonal strain, okay?
-Yeah.

46:11.959 --> 46:14.125
-But we are not Fleetwood Mac.
-(CLATTERING)

46:14.125 --> 46:15.667
You should want
to be Fleetwood Mac.

46:15.667 --> 46:17.166
You should want
to be Fleetwood Mac.

46:17.500 --> 46:18.667
You should want that.

46:19.250 --> 46:20.959
JENNI KONNER: Well, Marnie has
a problem with infidelity.

46:20.959 --> 46:23.750
She's just always looking
for the next best thing,

46:23.750 --> 46:26.417
and looking for more excitement
and more drama.

46:26.625 --> 46:29.542
The minute something is settled,
she can't stay there.

46:29.542 --> 46:31.875
She's never been able
to be comfortable with something

46:31.875 --> 46:34.667
that didn't contain
massive amounts of drama.

46:35.834 --> 46:37.500
(HEAVY BREATHING)
