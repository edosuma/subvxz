The narrow streets of the
neatly dressed schoolchildren

02:05.193 --> 02:09.395
different Africa than
I've ever known.

02:09.396 --> 02:10.530
It's tight, small.

02:10.531 --> 02:15.835
The architecture
speaks of many layers.

02:15.836 --> 02:18.271
The hierarchy long gone
but still evident.

02:18.272 --> 02:24.611
The famous Zanzibar
door, for instance.

02:24.612 --> 02:32.612
Meticulously carved from
mohagany and tique.

02:32.720 --> 02:35.388
They reveal the professions.

02:35.389 --> 02:37.089
Brass bikes similar to India.

02:37.090 --> 02:40.927
The lotis flower and the symbol

02:40.928 --> 02:42.429
meant to promote fertility.

02:42.430 --> 02:44.364
And chains, a reminder that this

02:44.365 --> 02:47.900
once was a central hub
of the slave trade.

02:47.901 --> 02:55.901
♪

03:05.819 --> 03:10.790
What Zanzibar is today is
overwhelmingly Muslim.

03:10.791 --> 03:11.958
99% of the population.

03:11.959 --> 03:15.828
And you see a strong influence
everywhere you look.

03:15.829 --> 03:19.332
The children are coming from the

03:19.333 --> 03:20.600
Medrassa, the streets are neat

03:20.601 --> 03:21.901
and private homes even of the

03:21.902 --> 03:25.137
very poor are maintained
with great pride.

03:25.138 --> 03:33.138
The call to prayer,
five times a day.

03:33.146 --> 03:36.649
Zanzibar part of Tanzania but

03:36.650 --> 03:41.688
also an autonomous state
sits just off the mainland.

03:41.689 --> 03:43.990
The minute you cross the
ocean from the mainland, you

03:43.991 --> 03:46.259
feel like you're in a different

03:46.260 --> 03:47.827
country and different
culture, different vibe.

03:47.828 --> 03:51.831
This is a native of Zanzibar

03:51.832 --> 03:53.500
and former tour guide and knows

03:53.501 --> 03:55.502
his way around these parts.

03:55.503 --> 03:56.869
So, what are our options here?

03:56.870 --> 04:00.807
This is what we call Mandazi.

04:00.808 --> 04:06.846
Mandazi, a Swahili treat or

04:06.847 --> 04:14.587
basically a donut
spiced with cormeander.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.188
Care for a cup of coffee?

04:16.189 --> 04:17.390
Yeah, let's do it.

04:17.391 --> 04:18.991
If you live here, if you're from

04:18.992 --> 04:20.360
here, chances are you start your

04:20.361 --> 04:22.228
day with bitter spiced coffee.

04:22.229 --> 04:26.198
Talk about the issues of
the day, politics for one.

04:26.199 --> 04:30.737
Maybe a pastry.

04:30.738 --> 04:31.871
Oh, that's good.

04:31.872 --> 04:34.874
So, you were born and bred here.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.643
How long has your
family been here?

04:36.644 --> 04:38.378
How far back do you guys go?

04:38.379 --> 04:42.882
I'm half Indian, half African,
and my mother has been

04:42.883 --> 04:44.050
here four generation.

04:44.051 --> 04:46.386
Four generations, that's
starting out in the...

04:46.387 --> 04:47.687
Late 1700s.

04:47.688 --> 04:48.221
Wow.

04:48.222 --> 04:50.089
Who built this neighborhood?

04:50.090 --> 04:58.090
Construction started in 1830s
in a Portuguese colony.

04:59.900 --> 05:03.235
And it started in 1864 but they

05:03.236 --> 05:05.037
lost a lot of power in 1996.

05:05.038 --> 05:06.072
Confused?

05:06.073 --> 05:07.440
Let's take a step back.

05:07.441 --> 05:08.775
The Persians were the first

05:08.776 --> 05:11.378
major power to set up here back

05:11.379 --> 05:13.746
around 975 a.D. Expanding their

05:13.747 --> 05:17.116
empire onto the strategically
positioned island.

05:17.117 --> 05:22.121
Then the Portuguese used
Zanzibar a hub for their slave

05:22.122 --> 05:23.523
trade and spices.

05:23.524 --> 05:28.361
Then they did the same
ultimately with the British who

05:28.362 --> 05:33.099
ruled from them.

05:33.100 --> 05:33.501
1964, revolution.

05:33.502 --> 05:35.067
As with most revolutions, the

05:35.068 --> 05:39.271
days following were
violent, chaotic and ugly.

05:39.272 --> 05:41.441
After overthrowing the mostly

05:41.442 --> 05:43.275
Arab government, reprisals.

05:43.276 --> 05:46.112
It wasn't intended for a

05:46.113 --> 05:49.115
revolution where more than 3,000

05:49.116 --> 05:51.618
Arabs and Indians were
moved out of this country.

05:51.619 --> 05:52.752
But your family stayed?

05:52.753 --> 05:54.320
My family stayed.

05:54.321 --> 05:56.055
Why?

05:56.056 --> 06:00.259
There was no money for
the family to move out.

06:00.260 --> 06:00.994
Tough times?

06:00.995 --> 06:08.801
Very tough times.

06:08.802 --> 06:12.805
In about two hours from stone

06:12.806 --> 06:16.643
town, this is John Biani,
a tiny fishing village.

06:16.644 --> 06:24.644
Here the first revolutionaries
met from an independent

06:25.986 --> 06:27.420
Zanzibar.

06:27.421 --> 06:30.823
Total assassination in 1972.

06:30.824 --> 06:34.260
This, too, is a grandson of the

06:34.261 --> 06:35.662
country's first president.

06:35.663 --> 06:37.697
Well, what was the political
situation back then?

06:37.698 --> 06:40.166
Well, it wasn't good.

06:40.167 --> 06:41.534
Basically it was English...

06:41.535 --> 06:43.836
Arabs in the middle and then the

06:43.837 --> 06:45.872
Africans way, way at the bottom.

06:45.873 --> 06:48.841
And it was a form of
apartheid, you know.

06:48.842 --> 06:52.344
Was this village sort of a
center for revolutionary...

06:52.345 --> 06:53.946
This village was important in

06:53.947 --> 06:57.116
terms of the political support
prior to the revolution.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.718
When my grandfather and my

06:58.719 --> 07:02.955
grandmother stayed right here

07:02.956 --> 07:06.526
and had meetings on the
field right over there.

07:06.527 --> 07:07.327
That's where they would have

07:07.328 --> 07:08.828
their meetings to raise support

07:08.829 --> 07:14.801
for the African people,
their it into identity.

07:14.802 --> 07:22.802
The objective was to give
identity to Zanzibar.

07:25.979 --> 07:28.548
Well, this is the house.

07:28.549 --> 07:34.488
They are preparing a
wonderful lunch for us.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.731
She used to take care of my

07:44.732 --> 07:49.570
grandmother many,
many years ago.

07:57.210 --> 07:59.411
She was a close family friend

07:59.412 --> 08:01.280
to him and his grandparents and

08:01.281 --> 08:06.085
she's putting together
quite a spread.

08:06.086 --> 08:07.920
Coconut rice, freshly caught

08:07.921 --> 08:11.390
fish called tasi simmered in

08:11.391 --> 08:12.892
broth of garlic and wine topped

08:12.893 --> 08:15.127
with a fresh salad of chopped

08:15.128 --> 08:18.430
tomato, eggplant,
cucumber and potato.

08:18.431 --> 08:21.634
Another fish called mackerel

08:21.635 --> 08:26.906
marinated in juice and
garlic an pan fried.

08:26.907 --> 08:27.808
That's looking good.

08:27.809 --> 08:31.443
So coconut rice.

08:31.444 --> 08:33.613
Japati bread from the other
side of the water there.

08:33.614 --> 08:34.614
That's it.

08:34.615 --> 08:38.116
This is Kasaba.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.952
Two different types
of fried bread.

08:39.953 --> 08:42.087
Wow, what a spread here.

08:42.089 --> 08:44.624
And you can use your hands.

08:44.625 --> 08:45.292
Good.

08:45.293 --> 08:46.458
This I can do by hand.

08:46.459 --> 08:51.430
The rice, I need help.

08:51.431 --> 08:52.464
Good.

08:52.465 --> 08:55.301
What do you think of the Kasaba?

08:55.302 --> 08:56.069
Lovely.

08:56.070 --> 08:59.739
The rice is great, too.

08:59.740 --> 09:02.341
Whatever your feelings on
revolutions, it is probably

09:02.342 --> 09:07.346
worth remembering that they
start in places like this.

09:07.347 --> 09:08.315
People talking.

09:08.316 --> 09:12.151
And when they are one, they are

09:12.152 --> 09:16.823
often won by feet of the
original planners, people who

09:16.824 --> 09:17.924
look like this.

09:17.925 --> 09:21.661
Look at all these kids.

09:21.662 --> 09:27.099
Watch out future
revolutionaries.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.768
There's no ideas.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.436
How to change comes from them.

09:30.437 --> 09:31.638
Think about it, the challenges

09:31.639 --> 09:34.140
we face as a small island

09:34.141 --> 09:35.341
country, doesn't the whole world

09:35.342 --> 09:36.508
face a similar challenge?

09:36.509 --> 09:37.344
Yeah.

09:37.345 --> 09:39.879
How to preserve all these
things, find balance?

09:39.880 --> 09:43.515
To me, I see Africa as a whole.

09:43.516 --> 09:49.221
I see a very interesting timing.

09:49.222 --> 09:49.823
Optimistic?

09:49.824 --> 09:51.357
I'm very optimistic and think

09:51.358 --> 09:53.025
we have a lot of great people.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.293
And given the opportunity, I

09:54.294 --> 09:56.696
think they can put a lot on the

09:56.697 --> 09:58.130
table, not only for themselves

09:58.131 --> 10:00.700
but also for the culture of east

10:00.701 --> 10:02.034
Africa and possibly the world.

10:02.035 --> 10:03.035
I think they are great people.

10:03.036 --> 10:06.205
Why not?

10:06.206 --> 10:07.641
The sky is the limit, right?

10:40.908 --> 10:43.776
Say you're going to Zanzibar

10:43.777 --> 10:45.912
and people will tell
you about the seafood.

10:45.913 --> 10:48.614
It's pretty impressive.

10:48.615 --> 10:56.088
In stone towns for downey
gardens, vendors set up an

10:56.089 --> 10:57.890
insane variety of
a seafood snack.

10:57.891 --> 11:04.731
Oh, yeah, I would
love some of that.

11:04.732 --> 11:11.637
We have shellfish, we have a

11:11.638 --> 11:18.410
mussel small shell, a tune
tuna fish, mahi-mahi.

11:18.411 --> 11:18.979
Good.

11:18.980 --> 11:26.980
Let me find some of the octopus.

11:29.156 --> 11:32.491
I like hot.

11:32.492 --> 11:40.492
Okay, good.

11:40.834 --> 11:41.001
Mmm.

11:41.002 --> 11:43.669
I like it, chewy but tasty.

11:43.670 --> 11:47.239
Lobster is working for me.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.675
Too spicy for you, ma'am.

11:49.676 --> 11:55.414
Believe me, only one of us is

11:55.415 --> 11:56.983
going to be [ Bleep ] tonight.

11:56.984 --> 12:04.984
And it's not going to be you.

12:05.793 --> 12:11.864
The famous Zanzibar pizza.

12:11.865 --> 12:17.003
Awesome.

12:17.004 --> 12:25.004
Sounds awesome to me.

12:28.015 --> 12:30.783
Looks good.

12:30.784 --> 12:32.384
Thank you.

12:32.385 --> 12:32.719
Mmm.

12:32.720 --> 12:39.658
Weird and wonderful.

12:39.659 --> 12:39.827
Mmm.

12:39.828 --> 12:41.027
These stands are extremely

12:41.028 --> 12:43.162
popular with locals and visitors

12:43.163 --> 12:46.165
alike, so of course the
government raised the rents.

12:46.166 --> 12:48.968
One guy, Juma, decided to pick

12:48.969 --> 12:51.670
up and move his place
a bit out of town.

12:51.671 --> 12:57.309
His customers came with him.

12:57.310 --> 12:58.577
This is Juma.

12:58.578 --> 13:00.212
Hi, Juma.

13:00.213 --> 13:00.914
How are you?

13:00.915 --> 13:02.048
So what are we having?

13:02.049 --> 13:03.349
Chick up and steak.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.985
Half chicken and all the spices.

13:05.986 --> 13:07.486
I ordered beef for now.

13:07.487 --> 13:08.421
Beef is good.

13:08.422 --> 13:10.422
I'll take half a chicken.

13:10.423 --> 13:11.158
Chicken?

13:11.159 --> 13:14.726
Yeah, sure.

13:14.727 --> 13:18.497
Juma is famous for his chicken.

13:18.498 --> 13:23.769
The bird is slathered with
a mixture of garlic, lime,

13:23.770 --> 13:25.571
coriandor, salt and pepper and

13:25.572 --> 13:27.173
grilled and served as a saw stay

13:27.174 --> 13:31.410
or whole pieces topped
with chili sauce.

13:31.411 --> 13:33.712
Preparation for this is
Saturday morning, prepare

13:33.713 --> 13:35.447
cutting and then coming here at

13:35.448 --> 13:39.018
6:30 to finish about 10:00.

13:39.019 --> 13:40.987
How many guys are working here?

13:40.988 --> 13:43.355
It's about six, seven of them.

13:43.356 --> 13:44.291
Six or seven of them.

13:44.292 --> 13:45.391
All around the table.

13:45.392 --> 13:48.627
Wow, it's like a big operation.

13:48.628 --> 13:51.130
He's finishing the skewers, I

13:51.131 --> 13:53.900
guess he's half-cooking
or saucing.

13:53.901 --> 13:56.502
He's re-heating,
finishing the skewers.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.871
That guy doesn't just set up

13:58.872 --> 14:00.439
plates for him to top with meat.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.607
Then I guess they have the bread

14:01.608 --> 14:04.076
and the sauce and
finishing to go, also.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.811
What are they squirting
on the fries?

14:05.812 --> 14:09.615
His hot sauce, ketchup.

14:09.616 --> 14:11.483
So you never go hungry here.

14:11.484 --> 14:12.919
There's always food
many the street.

14:12.920 --> 14:15.988
If you come here to buy ten
skewers, you are eventually

14:15.989 --> 14:17.656
going to buy 20 or 30 because

14:17.657 --> 14:18.958
someone is always asking for

14:18.959 --> 14:20.092
food and you always buy it.

14:20.093 --> 14:21.827
It's just the culture.

14:21.828 --> 14:23.996
You always shell out food.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.965
There we go.

14:25.966 --> 14:32.004
And you use the
stick as your fork.

14:32.005 --> 14:34.173
Hot, hot, hot.

14:34.174 --> 14:36.808
Where do you think the
recipe came from?

14:36.809 --> 14:39.011
This is a real mixed
up history here?

14:39.012 --> 14:43.415
Mostly Arabic/Indian components
with the spices, most

14:43.416 --> 14:45.151
of the trees like mangos came

14:45.152 --> 14:47.686
from India, pineapples
from Brazil.

14:47.687 --> 14:55.687
Tamron, southeast
Asia, not even India.

14:57.030 --> 14:57.664
Damn, that's good.

14:57.665 --> 14:59.098
The chicken is really awesome.

14:59.099 --> 15:01.968
I might need some more of this.

15:01.969 --> 15:04.036
I'm liking the heat, man.

15:04.037 --> 15:07.439
Good stuff.

15:07.440 --> 15:15.440
Incredible.

15:17.817 --> 15:20.552
The 250-mile flight from

15:20.553 --> 15:22.388
Zanzibar across the water to the

15:22.389 --> 15:29.661
town of Arusha takes
an hour and a half.

15:29.662 --> 15:31.863
But culturely you are flying

15:31.864 --> 15:39.864
from Texas to the Philippines.

15:45.512 --> 15:50.416
Kilimanjaro into whose white
peak the hero saw himself

disappear as he
slipped into death.

15:52.485 --> 16:00.485
From there we head into
the Sarang Sarangeti.

16:03.463 --> 16:11.463
♪

16:16.676 --> 16:24.583
The journey of this kind one
must expect an occasional

16:24.584 --> 16:32.584
setback.

16:38.198 --> 16:44.136
We reached the eastern edge of

16:44.137 --> 16:52.137
the Sanghetti where it is a
significant descent to the

16:53.413 --> 16:53.646
crater.

16:53.647 --> 16:58.150
A long time ago the crater
collapsed on itself creating

this kaldera, creating
a truly lost word.

A hot bubble bath awaits after
a long day in the bush.

17:26.679 --> 17:30.482
Perhaps a dry cherry of
a glass of decanter.

17:30.483 --> 17:32.451
The next morning one rises to

17:32.452 --> 17:35.487
breakfast in one's chambers
on the balcony, perhaps.

17:35.488 --> 17:41.260
Silver service, hot coffee,
freshly baked croissant.

Good morning.

Thank you, sir.

17:43.263 --> 17:43.996
You're welcome.

17:43.997 --> 17:48.834
The rules of the house while
slightly restricting are

17:48.835 --> 17:50.502
sensible enough and given the

17:50.503 --> 17:54.005
luxurious surroundings and
the view, hardly a burden.

17:54.006 --> 17:55.374
You're not supposed to wander

17:55.375 --> 17:57.709
around at night here unescorted.

17:57.710 --> 18:05.710
There's lions and hyenas
and baboons and stuff.

18:09.055 --> 18:13.525
I heard they can get a little

18:13.526 --> 18:15.827
rakey, but there were
no knocks on the door.

18:15.828 --> 18:17.896
I know what you're thinking

18:17.897 --> 18:18.731
already, you're not going to go

18:18.732 --> 18:23.535
out there and shoot some
beautiful animal in the brain.

18:23.536 --> 18:24.404
Answer?

18:24.405 --> 18:26.138
No.

18:26.139 --> 18:28.374
What kind of sick [ Bleep ]

18:28.375 --> 18:29.575
Wants to shoot an elephant?

18:29.576 --> 18:31.410
Even the toilet has a nice view.

18:31.411 --> 18:36.415
This is pretty much what you see

18:36.416 --> 18:42.087
because you're sitting
on the snakes.

18:42.088 --> 18:43.722
Idyllic natural setting and

18:43.723 --> 18:48.628
good plumbing, it's
pretty much paradise.

19:10.750 --> 19:18.750
It's nuts driving
into the Serangeti.

19:21.060 --> 19:22.093
After a short while you actually

19:22.094 --> 19:23.929
get used to the jungle book

19:23.930 --> 19:31.930
scene playing out in
front of your car.

19:35.242 --> 19:36.942
It's interesting to see the

19:36.943 --> 19:44.943
giraffe and wild beasts, zebra,

19:45.117 --> 19:46.952
they all seem to pretty
much hang together.

19:46.953 --> 19:49.120
The buffalos take
the big stuff out.

19:49.121 --> 19:51.723
The zebras follow it down and

19:51.724 --> 19:57.663
the wild beasts are
the closed crop.

19:57.664 --> 20:00.131

20:04.804 --> 20:08.740
like I know the Barney counter.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.476
About every tree you see here

20:10.477 --> 20:13.412
that's lying on its side has not

20:13.413 --> 20:14.646
fallen over by choice, it's

20:14.647 --> 20:22.647
being pushed over by elephants.

20:22.655 --> 20:23.822
There's an elephant over there.

20:23.823 --> 20:27.926
Oh, yeah.

20:27.927 --> 20:28.127
Whoo!

20:28.128 --> 20:29.261
It's a big bull.

20:29.262 --> 20:30.329
Magnificent.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.830
Will he charge us?

20:31.831 --> 20:32.432
No.

20:32.433 --> 20:35.334
If we piss him off?

20:35.335 --> 20:43.335
If we piss him off he would.

20:52.685 --> 20:57.022
They sleep so
soundly, the zebra.

20:57.023 --> 20:57.824
You can creep right up.

20:57.825 --> 21:03.362
Zebras as and more zebras you
almost get bored looking at

21:03.363 --> 21:05.163
them.

21:05.164 --> 21:09.368
Giraffes look slightly irritated
to be interrupted and

21:09.369 --> 21:12.270
stadium-sized crowds
of wild beasts.

21:12.271 --> 21:19.177
The unkept looking
things every 100 yards.

21:19.178 --> 21:22.080
All that's missing
is a happy sound.

21:22.081 --> 21:24.383
Everyone thinks wild beasts

21:24.384 --> 21:26.251
jump into the rivers, but that

21:26.252 --> 21:27.819
only happens two
months of the year.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.020
The rest of the year they are

21:29.021 --> 21:29.989
trekking through the bush.

21:29.990 --> 21:31.890
To me this is so much more

21:31.891 --> 21:33.725
spectacular when you
see the big numbers.

21:33.726 --> 21:37.162
You'll be in an area this
morning that was full of wild

21:37.163 --> 21:42.568
beasts and go there this
afternoon and there's not one.

21:42.569 --> 21:46.938
They have moved.

21:46.939 --> 21:50.742
Thousands and thousands of
wild beasts are on their

21:50.743 --> 21:51.711
migration everywhere.

21:51.712 --> 21:55.881
A big circle stretched out
across Tanzania in search of

21:55.882 --> 21:56.915
prime grazing.

21:56.916 --> 21:58.283
It's all about water and grass

21:58.284 --> 22:02.888
and a good place to make babies.

22:02.889 --> 22:04.890
I mean, look at this little guy.

22:04.891 --> 22:07.125
He's keeping up with his mom.

22:07.126 --> 22:08.226
He's doing okay.

22:08.227 --> 22:09.595
Within 15 minutes of being

22:09.596 --> 22:11.196
born, they are up and standing.

22:11.197 --> 22:11.598
Really.

22:11.599 --> 22:16.635
Running as fast as their moms
within a couple of hours.

22:16.636 --> 22:20.372
There's a wild beast
that didn't make it.

22:20.373 --> 22:21.640
How long has it been there?

22:21.641 --> 22:22.974
A day or two.

22:22.975 --> 22:25.110
Very fresh.

22:25.111 --> 22:26.211
You don't want to get lost here.

22:26.212 --> 22:28.113
You definitely don't want to be

22:28.114 --> 22:31.282
on foot outside your car
or injured, for instance.

22:31.283 --> 22:36.321
Nature as they say is a cruel

22:36.322 --> 22:39.124
miscus to take care of
its own without mercy.

22:39.125 --> 22:40.959
The evidence of this cool math

22:40.960 --> 22:43.128
called survival is everywhere.

22:43.129 --> 22:44.295
Non-immediate family, you're not

22:44.296 --> 22:45.831
going to help a brother out.

22:45.832 --> 22:46.832
You would think, huh?

22:46.833 --> 22:52.971
Start limping, first
come the hyenas.

22:52.972 --> 22:55.974
They see the vultures dropping
and that's key to them

22:55.975 --> 22:56.676
there's food up.

22:56.677 --> 22:59.645
And the vultures need the hyenas

22:59.646 --> 23:01.580
to rip open the skin
to start eating it.

23:01.581 --> 23:03.248
By the time they stop ripping

23:03.249 --> 23:06.452
out your soft parts and treating

23:06.453 --> 23:09.020
your femur like a chew toy, they

23:09.021 --> 23:12.323
call them the undertaker birds

23:12.324 --> 23:14.159
that are waiting for their turn.

23:14.160 --> 23:15.827
When I have cause to reflect on

23:15.828 --> 23:18.764
a pack of hyenas ripping out the

23:18.765 --> 23:20.532
guts, I think, you know what?

23:20.533 --> 23:25.671
I could really go for
some Pesto right now.

23:25.672 --> 23:28.640
By late day we pause for lunch.

23:28.641 --> 23:31.176
Penne with Pesto, steamed baby

23:31.177 --> 23:34.145
corn and snow peas, sprinkled

23:34.146 --> 23:37.215
tomatoes with Parmesan
and oh look, brownies.

23:37.216 --> 23:39.851
Boy, the hippos
are coming close.

23:39.852 --> 23:46.391
Yeah, you can smell the pesto.

23:46.392 --> 23:48.359
They are coming ashore.

23:48.360 --> 23:49.628
Yes, Dave.

23:49.629 --> 23:51.196
Over thankfully cold beers, I

23:51.197 --> 23:52.731
learn who is really the most

23:52.732 --> 23:54.866
dangerous animal around here.

23:54.867 --> 23:55.367
Yeah, that's right.

23:55.368 --> 23:57.969
Mr. Lovable funny hippo always

23:57.970 --> 24:00.205
in a tutu in the cartoons.

24:00.206 --> 24:02.508
A vicious, unpredictable and ape

24:02.509 --> 24:05.143
parentally incredibly
fast moving killer.

24:05.144 --> 24:07.378
You happen to leave here and

24:07.379 --> 24:09.380
go to pee behind the tree here

24:09.381 --> 24:11.550
and come face to face with a

24:11.551 --> 24:13.652
hippo, the hippo would easily

24:13.653 --> 24:16.387
outrun you in a big chomp, big

24:16.388 --> 24:18.389
tusks that will go straight

24:18.390 --> 24:19.858
through you, chop you in half.

24:19.859 --> 24:22.327
Just get between them and
their mud hole and they'll be

24:22.328 --> 24:27.499
all over you like Justin
Bieber's bodyguards.

24:27.500 --> 24:28.900
It can get ugly.

24:28.901 --> 24:35.073
What do hippo penises look like?

24:35.074 --> 24:35.875
I don't know.

24:35.876 --> 24:38.209
Do they ever emerge
with a big hard on?

24:38.210 --> 24:39.410
Not that I've said.

24:39.411 --> 24:42.180
They are under water.

24:42.181 --> 24:43.248
I don't go snorkeling.

24:43.249 --> 24:44.851
I find that comforting to know.

25:04.871 --> 25:12.871
They are among the last great
warrior tribes on earth.

25:14.080 --> 25:14.781
Semi-nomatic, they believe all

25:14.782 --> 25:17.983
the cattle are a gift
from the gods to them.

25:17.984 --> 25:19.885
They move with their animals

25:19.886 --> 25:22.153
across the Tanzanian planes

25:22.154 --> 25:25.791
setting up homes where they
find the best grazing.

The big cats, lions,
roam free here.

An area called Indutut.

26:13.706 --> 26:16.374
The lions are an enemy, they

26:16.375 --> 26:18.944
are a competitor, but they are

26:33.392 --> 26:35.661
needs, traditions and the basic

26:35.662 --> 26:37.328
identities of the people and the

26:37.329 --> 26:38.664
outside's world's desire to

26:38.665 --> 26:40.265
protect the beautiful
killing machines.

takes on a hungry adult lion.

26:46.906 --> 26:49.808
Nobody wants this.

26:49.809 --> 26:52.844
For the Masai, being comprised

26:52.845 --> 26:55.146
of the comings and goings of the

26:55.147 --> 27:02.420
lion population is a useful

27:25.377 --> 27:27.679
Engela has brought several Masai

27:28.881 --> 27:32.583
close the lions they
share this land with.

27:32.584 --> 27:34.585
So often on my days out when

27:34.586 --> 27:37.555
I'm working with the Masai,
you don't eat at all.

27:37.556 --> 27:39.290
You get a cup of tee in the

27:39.291 --> 27:40.458
morning and then if you're lucky

27:40.459 --> 27:44.529
in the rainy season, you'll
get fresh milk or this.

27:44.530 --> 27:48.299
This is Amasi, by the way, a

27:48.300 --> 27:51.436
lumpy yogurt drink similar
to the Masai diet.

27:51.437 --> 27:52.304
Cheers.

27:52.305 --> 27:53.772
And before you say yuck, it

27:53.773 --> 27:55.040
may be worth noting that between

27:55.041 --> 27:58.543
their nearly 100% protein diet

27:58.544 --> 28:05.717
of meat, blood and dairy,
the Masai are known to have

28:05.718 --> 28:07.085
Olympic-level Stan ma and

28:07.086 --> 28:08.720
condition and can run miles at a

28:08.721 --> 28:09.988
time without rest or water and

28:09.989 --> 28:13.324

28:13.325 --> 28:14.826
any physical contact
given half the chance.

28:14.827 --> 28:20.832
So help yourself to some
sour lumpy goodness.

28:20.833 --> 28:28.833
A little honey and raisins
in there, good to go.

28:31.110 --> 28:32.343
It's so different here, like

28:32.344 --> 28:35.680
the rainy season, dry season.

28:35.681 --> 28:39.684
Such different challenges.

28:39.685 --> 28:42.821
What do you think of
going under here?

28:42.822 --> 28:50.822
I'm okay with it.

28:58.204 --> 29:03.174
Currently, Engela is tracking
two lions particular.

29:03.175 --> 29:11.175
Ramu ss and pouyo.

29:12.551 --> 29:13.651
Do you see them?

29:13.652 --> 29:15.220
Yes, I do.

29:15.221 --> 29:17.889
I see them.

29:17.890 --> 29:18.057
Wow.

29:18.058 --> 29:19.157
Two of them.

29:19.158 --> 29:19.859
Yeah.

29:19.860 --> 29:21.359
You like them, don't you?

29:21.360 --> 29:23.628
Oh, they are magnificent.

29:23.629 --> 29:24.729
Very admirable.

29:24.730 --> 29:27.999
He's a bit of a
warrior, that one.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.903
Should we try to upright them?

29:31.904 --> 29:34.305
Yeah.

29:34.306 --> 29:37.308
When you go to the lions, you

29:37.309 --> 29:38.743
don't ever drive
straight on them.

29:38.744 --> 29:46.744
You kind of go in at an
angle to relax them.

29:47.854 --> 29:52.090
That's funny how they
pretend they don't see you.

29:52.091 --> 29:59.931
But they are so
completely aware.

29:59.932 --> 30:02.567
So basically what we look at to

30:02.568 --> 30:10.568
identify them are their spots,
like their fingerprint.

30:11.110 --> 30:15.446
Punctured in the face, that
means he's fighting with a

30:15.447 --> 30:15.882
female.

30:15.883 --> 30:17.415
It's too dangerous to go for the

30:17.416 --> 30:18.950
head area if they're fighting.

30:18.951 --> 30:20.785
The reason for the colors, do

30:20.786 --> 30:22.620
you see how lions behave to cope

30:22.621 --> 30:25.123
with threats in the area, to

30:25.124 --> 30:29.928
show that lions and Masai
can stay together.

30:29.929 --> 30:35.433
They will always live together.

30:35.434 --> 30:41.606
For the Masai, one of the
diminish things for them is

30:41.607 --> 30:42.640
large ranges.

30:42.641 --> 30:45.476
The same resource
that the lion needs.

30:45.477 --> 30:48.213
If push came to show and one

30:48.214 --> 30:50.248
would have to go, it wouldn't be

30:50.249 --> 30:52.050
the wildlife that's bringing in

30:52.051 --> 30:54.652
far too much for this
area of the country.

30:54.653 --> 30:56.454
If they can show you they are

30:56.455 --> 30:58.156
actually fundamental to protect

30:58.157 --> 30:59.925
them in this area and to protect

30:59.926 --> 31:05.263
the lions, well, then it's
the better for them as well.

31:05.264 --> 31:13.071
And what's total population
of lions countrywide?

31:13.072 --> 31:14.839
Tanzania probably has 50%

31:14.840 --> 31:19.044
population for the lion,
so it's important.

31:19.045 --> 31:23.949
And best estimates are that
there are 30,000 lions.

31:23.950 --> 31:28.453
It's not so worrisome the
size but the rapid decrease.

31:28.454 --> 31:31.189
We have lost large predators in

31:31.190 --> 31:33.824
the world but the
world carries on.

31:33.825 --> 31:35.193
There would probably be other

31:35.194 --> 31:43.194
predators to take their place,
the hyenas, cheetahs and

31:43.669 --> 31:44.303
leopards.

31:44.304 --> 31:49.307
Lions are a big show of the
ecosystem that is healthy.

31:49.308 --> 31:52.510
They are important to that.

31:52.511 --> 31:56.614
20, 22 hours of the
day they relax.

31:56.615 --> 31:59.951
So when you see sleeping cats...

31:59.952 --> 32:01.287
Man, they are beautiful.

32:19.005 --> 32:21.639
Just a few miles from the

32:21.640 --> 32:29.640
crater's rim, the village,
about 400 Masai live here.

32:30.482 --> 32:33.318
He's the chief, four wives, 12

32:33.319 --> 32:34.919
children, a handful of woman are

32:34.920 --> 32:40.891
old enough to be out
looking after the herds.

32:40.892 --> 32:44.195
I was born in New Jersey
and live in New York.

32:44.196 --> 32:44.563
Oh.

32:44.564 --> 32:46.864
You have a son in
New Jersey, yeah?

32:46.865 --> 32:49.900
Yes, yes.

32:49.901 --> 32:55.740
He's at one of the colleges
known as Montclair state.

32:55.741 --> 32:59.010
Oh, sure, I know Montclair well.

32:59.011 --> 33:00.045
Near where I grew up.

33:00.046 --> 33:04.182
Oh, yes.

33:04.183 --> 33:07.218
There's going to
be some downpours.

33:07.219 --> 33:09.387
Well, do you think
it comes here?

33:09.388 --> 33:10.388
No.

33:10.389 --> 33:10.922
No.

33:10.922 --> 33:11.623
Not us.

33:11.624 --> 33:15.726
It's funny, like they always

33:15.727 --> 33:19.030
know since there are no
weather reports out here.

33:19.031 --> 33:20.465
They have been migrating with

33:20.466 --> 33:21.632
the season since they came to

33:21.633 --> 33:23.301
this part of Africa sometime in

33:23.302 --> 33:27.072
the 15th century, long, long

33:27.073 --> 33:28.873
before this became
a national park.

33:28.874 --> 33:36.114
Here we run into the kind of

33:36.115 --> 33:37.282
conflict that the world will see

33:37.283 --> 33:40.751
as they value the most.

33:40.752 --> 33:44.455
Parts of nature populated
with magnificent, wild but

33:44.456 --> 33:48.993
aggressively protected animals

33:48.994 --> 33:51.129
were the indigenous people.

33:51.130 --> 33:58.303
So when I came here to start

33:58.304 --> 33:59.970
up here, they were suspicious.

33:59.971 --> 34:01.005
They thought it was going to

34:01.006 --> 34:02.807
lead to us being kicked out.

34:02.808 --> 34:06.444
That's a constant
fear in this area.

34:06.445 --> 34:10.014
Because in the past,
they kill them.

34:10.014 --> 34:13.518
But today we stop that.

34:13.518 --> 34:15.018
Or we can kill.

34:15.020 --> 34:17.188
If you have no
other alternative.

34:17.188 --> 34:17.856
Yeah.

34:17.857 --> 34:21.492
That's why we have a sphere.

34:21.493 --> 34:24.027
We are not harmless people but

34:24.029 --> 34:25.463
it is only for protection only.

34:25.464 --> 34:28.433
The Masai know we are here to

34:28.434 --> 34:29.833
work with them and we hope to

34:29.835 --> 34:31.969
start the lion guardian project,

34:31.969 --> 34:35.039
which basically you hire masais

34:35.040 --> 34:38.376
to protect the lions
rather that kill them.

34:38.377 --> 34:44.149
When all of the cattle the

34:44.150 --> 34:45.716
Masai people have, how do you

34:45.717 --> 34:47.885
protect them from the predators?

34:47.886 --> 34:50.888
If you do not bother them,
they will not bother you.

34:50.889 --> 34:52.690
How about when they are grazing?

34:52.690 --> 34:55.193
When they are grazing, we
have people who follow.

34:55.194 --> 35:00.131
And that's enough to
discourage hyenas or lions?

35:00.132 --> 35:01.499
Yes.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.234
But sometimes they are happy

35:03.235 --> 35:07.071
lion, so they are making it loud

35:07.072 --> 35:13.911
to assure they are happy.

35:13.912 --> 35:19.517
And they make sounds to
know they are happy.

35:19.518 --> 35:21.752
And if they catch something, we

35:21.753 --> 35:29.753
can hear very close,
only like... and stop.

35:31.897 --> 35:35.566
And if it's a loud
that's a happy.

35:35.567 --> 35:37.101
That's happy.

35:37.102 --> 35:39.937
The purring noise,
that's not good.

35:39.938 --> 35:40.706
That is not.

35:40.707 --> 35:45.276
That's not a hear
kitty situation.

35:45.277 --> 35:47.512
That's him looking for food.

35:47.513 --> 35:48.247
Okay.

35:48.248 --> 35:55.386
My cat ♪

35:55.387 --> 35:57.955
okay, this, a lot of you are

35:57.956 --> 36:01.559
going to find very disturbing.

36:01.560 --> 36:03.794
I'm guessing the little goat

36:03.795 --> 36:11.795
over there is about
to get the bad news.

36:14.273 --> 36:16.474
Come now.

36:16.475 --> 36:19.477
I try and be a good guest.

36:19.478 --> 36:22.613
I eat what my hosts
put in front of me.

36:22.614 --> 36:24.982
I try to take responsibility if

36:24.983 --> 36:28.052
something dies for my dinner.

36:28.053 --> 36:28.754
Here?

36:28.755 --> 36:31.656
No, no, here.

36:31.657 --> 36:34.091
So when the chief asks if I'd

36:34.092 --> 36:35.826
care to do the honors and tells

36:35.827 --> 36:42.300
me how it has to be
done, I'm not happy.

36:42.301 --> 36:45.403
In fact, as I close off his air

36:45.404 --> 36:53.404
passages, I'm struggling
to not throw up on myself.

36:59.851 --> 37:04.689
Yeah.

37:04.690 --> 37:07.625
Do you know how to skin?

37:07.626 --> 37:10.961
Maybe I can show you.

37:10.962 --> 37:13.664
Go ahead.

37:13.665 --> 37:17.167
The Masai traditionally kill

37:17.168 --> 37:19.203
their goats by suffocation, for

37:19.204 --> 37:21.706
very good reason, it turns out,

37:21.707 --> 37:23.007
to keep the blood, which is a

37:23.008 --> 37:29.614
vital component for the Masai

37:29.615 --> 37:32.350
diet abundant in
the chest cavity.

37:32.351 --> 37:40.157
Let's prepare to
take the skin out.

37:40.158 --> 37:43.828
Oh, good.

37:43.829 --> 37:48.899
Here now.

37:48.900 --> 37:52.870
Then like this.

37:52.871 --> 37:54.372
More?

37:54.373 --> 37:56.741
Everything's intact, beautiful.

37:56.742 --> 38:00.745
So all the blood... it
filled up the cavity and

38:00.746 --> 38:03.180
started to get coagulated.

38:03.181 --> 38:04.149
Yes.

38:04.149 --> 38:05.083
I get it now.

38:05.084 --> 38:07.985
Easier now to take
the blood out.

38:07.986 --> 38:08.520
See?

38:08.521 --> 38:11.556
I've never seen that.

38:11.557 --> 38:12.757
That's super cool.

38:12.758 --> 38:17.928
Some would like to drink fresh.

38:17.929 --> 38:25.929
Sure.

38:27.873 --> 38:29.340
It's good.

38:29.341 --> 38:29.541
♪

38:29.542 --> 38:32.643
People, they eat this one fresh.

38:32.644 --> 38:37.014
That's kidney.

38:37.015 --> 38:37.849
Yeah.

38:37.850 --> 38:39.617
Just a little piece.

38:39.618 --> 38:44.755
Deed done, it's time
for a little kidney.

38:44.756 --> 38:46.957
Enjoy the spoils, then party.

38:46.958 --> 38:48.959
Sweet, actually, I like them

38:48.960 --> 38:51.196
better like this than cooked.

39:00.271 --> 39:02.373
They're smelling good.

39:02.374 --> 39:03.774
That's great.

39:03.775 --> 39:11.775
Not too much of a meat eater,
but this I kind of like.

39:12.050 --> 39:12.250
♪

39:12.251 --> 39:17.955
Even on the Serengeti, it
ain't barbecue if there ain't

39:17.956 --> 39:18.989
some kind of beer.

39:18.990 --> 39:25.596
Normally the Masai, they have
what you call honey beer.

39:25.597 --> 39:30.935
You drink it just very strong.

39:30.936 --> 39:36.941
Love to try some.

39:36.942 --> 39:44.942
Noticed a palpable
change in the mood.

39:56.495 --> 39:57.162
Welcome.

39:57.163 --> 40:04.535
Asante.

40:04.536 --> 40:05.471
Pretty tasty.

40:05.472 --> 40:08.372
Almost refreshing.

40:08.373 --> 40:15.846
Like a palm wine, kind
of pulpy-like taste.

40:15.847 --> 40:23.847
You can definitely
taste the honey.

40:24.155 --> 40:29.126
Welcome to our culture.

40:29.127 --> 40:32.296
Everyone has to
carry a big knife.

40:32.297 --> 40:39.069
Many aspects of their lifestyle
and traditions remain

40:39.070 --> 40:41.639
unchanged.

40:41.640 --> 40:43.173
Awesome.

40:43.174 --> 40:46.210
This does not mean Masai don't

40:46.211 --> 40:50.881
have cell phones, by the way.

40:50.882 --> 40:52.583
Everybody does.

40:52.584 --> 40:55.686
We are talking about how can

40:55.687 --> 40:57.722
we balance this, because they're

40:57.723 --> 40:58.889
now looking to send our children

40:58.890 --> 41:02.860
to school, getting a good

41:02.861 --> 41:07.264
education, but we still
stay a very strong culture.

41:07.265 --> 41:10.568
So it's really a hard
time, but we continue.

41:10.569 --> 41:11.869
That's another question, when

41:11.870 --> 41:13.838
your son comes back from new

41:13.839 --> 41:15.540
Jersey, you know, is your son

41:15.541 --> 41:18.075
going to want a motorcycle?

41:18.076 --> 41:20.511
Is he going to want a car?

41:20.512 --> 41:22.580
A flat screen TV?

41:22.581 --> 41:23.081
I don't know.

41:23.082 --> 41:26.216
As you know, the children, they

41:26.217 --> 41:28.052
quickly change their mind.

41:28.053 --> 41:36.053
They may one day and
say... I don't know.

41:37.428 --> 41:43.968
It's beautiful, this country,
this part of Africa.

41:43.969 --> 41:46.704
Geographically huge,
but not really.

41:46.705 --> 41:50.207
As the world and what we need to

41:50.208 --> 41:54.579
live in it shrinks every day.

41:54.580 --> 41:57.615
Who gets to live here?

41:57.616 --> 42:01.952
Who or what do we want to see,

42:01.953 --> 42:05.122
is for better or worse
going to determine that.

42:05.123 --> 42:08.425
Nearly $1.5 billion is spent

42:08.426 --> 42:09.827
here every year by people who

42:09.828 --> 42:15.465
come wanting to look mostly
at beautiful animals.

42:15.466 --> 42:17.401
That's an amount that's hard to

42:17.402 --> 42:25.402
argue with, and
impossible to outrun.
