00:13.535 --> 00:15.058

of every other mob character

00:16.190 --> 00:17.713

deserve any respect

00:17.756 --> 00:19.323

Fuckin' he's the man!

00:33.685 --> 00:34.556

00:35.209 --> 00:36.558
He's been in almost

00:36.601 --> 00:38.081
every major crime movie
in the past fifty years

00:39.909 --> 00:40.431
He always plays the
violent one who curses
and yells all the time

00:40.475 --> 00:40.997
that's it!

00:42.129 --> 00:42.868

Yeah.

00:57.579 --> 00:59.146
-aight then

00:59.189 --> 01:00.669

01:01.931 --> 01:02.845
...name one person
Pacino would play

01:05.152 --> 01:06.153
The boss

01:07.110 --> 01:08.285
Who, Vincent?
-Yeah.

01:08.329 --> 01:10.896
Nah man you got
that all wrong dude

01:12.115 --> 01:14.509
Vincent is way too crazy
to be played by Pacino

01:15.336 --> 01:16.337
Then who would play Vincent?

01:17.077 --> 01:18.252
Jack Nicholson.

01:18.295 --> 01:20.210
Jack Nicholson!?
-Yes

01:21.429 --> 01:23.039
Vincent is mothafuckin'
Jack as Frank Costello

01:23.083 --> 01:25.128
"As Good As It Gets" Jack
Nicholson? -YES

01:25.172 --> 01:26.173
Now Johnny...

01:27.609 --> 01:28.697
...that guy is somebody Pacino
or maybe even DeNiro

01:28.740 --> 01:30.220
coulda played in
their younger years

01:31.656 --> 01:34.311
Well which one of these
handsom devils gets to plan ME?

01:34.355 --> 01:37.488
You're more like a-like a
Billy Crystal type

01:38.707 --> 01:40.012
Man fuck you man I
ain't no Billy Crystal

01:40.056 --> 01:41.101
Yeah...

01:41.144 --> 01:43.146
You fuckin' look
like Chris Tucker

01:44.147 --> 01:45.105
-but littler

01:45.801 --> 01:46.932
I'm with Ross, why?

01:56.507 --> 01:58.379
Yeah I got it.
Nah, it's not far from here

01:58.422 --> 02:01.077
Yeah I know where that is man.
-Shut up.

02:01.904 --> 02:03.035
So you want us to get him...

02:04.211 --> 02:06.126
and meet back there?

02:07.214 --> 02:08.084
Aight.

02:08.911 --> 02:09.693
-What the fuck man?

02:10.347 --> 02:11.000
-That was Johnny

02:12.306 --> 02:13.481
Seems like we got some
more collecting to do

02:14.612 --> 02:16.875
Hmm. His plan actually
worked this time

02:16.919 --> 02:18.877
Little bitch finally got
his shit together

02:19.530 --> 02:20.749
Bout fuckin' time.

02:20.792 --> 02:21.793
-I know right?

02:22.316 --> 02:23.186
Fuck, man

02:24.666 --> 02:26.146
He wants us to collect
then tie up the loose ends.

02:27.059 --> 02:28.583
Once we do that
hopefully we be good.

02:29.410 --> 02:30.628
You mean we gotta go fuckin...?

02:30.672 --> 02:32.674
No shit man.

02:32.717 --> 02:34.458
-What the fuck else
have we been doing
in the past for him?

02:35.242 --> 02:36.243
Man...

02:38.114 --> 02:40.943
Why's the boss tryina
have us knock off
everyone all of a sudden?

02:43.032 --> 02:45.165
I don't know, I think it's
because his experience is
gettin' the best of him

02:46.644 --> 02:48.646
He's tired of stayin'
all paranoid and takin'
everyone's bullshit

02:48.690 --> 02:50.692
So you know what? He's cappin
motherfuckers out.

02:50.735 --> 02:52.346
I don't give a damn
and neither should you

02:53.260 --> 02:54.086
we gettin paid for this shit...

02:55.392 --> 02:56.088
Why doesn't Johnny
do this shit man?

02:57.177 --> 02:58.047
Jonny does what he's told.

02:58.700 --> 03:00.005
You mean like us?

03:00.049 --> 03:01.616
Just like us.
Let's get the fuck outta here.

03:04.009 --> 03:06.751
[engine starts]

03:10.102 --> 03:12.192

Shut up you dumb fuck!

blasted or in jail.

03:30.166 --> 03:31.167

03:51.405 --> 03:52.754

04:05.854 --> 04:08.117

04:12.121 --> 04:14.428
Voice Over: My grandba
told me years ago,

04:14.471 --> 04:17.082
you really need
few things in life.

04:17.560 --> 04:19.302
A little love,

04:20.084 --> 04:20.695
a lot of money,

04:21.738 --> 04:22.784
respect,

04:23.437 --> 04:24.220
good decision making.

04:28.180 --> 04:30.705
I got everything I
need and then some...

04:32.097 --> 04:33.098
Fuck it.

04:34.578 --> 04:36.537
I hold stock in all the major
black markets around.

04:39.191 --> 04:41.629
Got a fiery ass lawyer

04:50.246 --> 04:53.118
You look out at

04:58.776 --> 05:01.170
From that nice little
coffee shop on the corner.

05:02.606 --> 05:05.174
To the skaniest strip joints.

05:05.653 --> 05:07.219
I own em' all.

05:09.091 --> 05:11.354
Motherfuckers here live
under my rule,

05:12.137 --> 05:12.790
in my territory,

05:14.401 --> 05:15.837
my way...

05:18.405 --> 05:21.277
There's just one thing
I've never gotten
through all my years:

05:22.365 --> 05:23.714
Job security.

05:25.107 --> 05:26.500
There's always some asshole
who thinks

05:26.543 --> 05:28.197
they can do what I do better.

05:30.068 --> 05:32.723
Fucking rats...

05:38.555 --> 05:40.862
Stefan.
-Ah yes

05:40.905 --> 05:41.906
I forgot.

05:43.038 --> 05:43.995
You know the drill,
once a month.

05:44.474 --> 05:44.996
I got his money.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.782
Also came here to warn you.

05:48.130 --> 05:49.218
Warn me?

05:50.045 --> 05:51.873
Keep reaching further
than your grasp,

05:53.004 --> 05:53.178
you'll have to
start paying double.

05:54.354 --> 05:54.484
-what're you
talkning about?

05:55.442 --> 05:57.052
Get back here you piece of shit

05:57.095 --> 05:58.314
-you've been in this
racket longer
than I have.

05:59.794 --> 06:01.056
You should know by now
he only keeps the pigs off

06:01.099 --> 06:02.971
your back while you
make an honest living.

06:04.189 --> 06:06.670
Changing social circles,
isn't part of the arragement.

06:08.019 --> 06:09.586
Well what if I make it a part
of the arangement.

06:14.548 --> 06:15.549
He's always watching.

06:17.899 --> 06:19.030
He's like...

06:19.074 --> 06:20.205
Santa Claus

06:20.249 --> 06:22.120
except he brings lead
instead of coal

06:22.164 --> 06:23.600
to all the naughty children

07:02.073 --> 07:04.032
He hasn't got it in him yet.

07:05.163 --> 07:06.338
He's getting a
little bold though.

07:07.252 --> 07:08.428
Too bold I'm thinking.

07:09.603 --> 07:09.777
Yo Johnny, want
us to do anything?

07:10.473 --> 07:12.083
No, not now.

07:12.127 --> 07:14.216
Ken's keeping an eye
on Stefan for me.

07:16.827 --> 07:18.742
Thatis the address of
a loyal customer.

07:20.265 --> 07:21.876
-I need you two to go
over and collect.

07:23.312 --> 07:24.356
Sure Johnny.

07:25.880 --> 07:26.750
-And tell the guy if he's
late again on a payment

07:26.794 --> 07:28.056
the boss'll make him pay double.

07:28.970 --> 07:30.580
-He may be trying
to go legit,

07:30.624 --> 07:31.625
-but that doesn't change the
fact that you gotta

07:31.668 --> 07:33.453
finish giving back first

07:35.150 --> 07:36.847
Alright man, we got it.

07:39.502 --> 07:41.461
I also may have one or
two more for you later.

07:42.026 --> 07:42.462
Damn!

07:43.201 --> 07:44.028
You sure?

07:45.639 --> 07:46.161
Sounds like the boss is getting
a little impatient, don't it?

07:47.075 --> 07:47.554
Don't worry about it.

07:48.816 --> 07:50.165
You just keep going
as business as usual.

07:50.208 --> 07:52.820
and everything will stay
Jim Freakin' Dandy

07:53.516 --> 07:54.430
But is it though?

07:56.780 --> 07:59.217
-Do as I ask,
and everything
will be fine.

08:03.961 --> 08:07.617
C'mon.
Boss needs me back at his place.

08:34.034 --> 08:35.471
FUCK!

08:36.994 --> 08:38.909
-You almost gave me a
fucking heart attack!

08:38.953 --> 08:40.041
-Son of a bitch...

08:41.825 --> 08:43.347
-So much for these
relaxation tapes
the ex-wife gave me.

08:43.392 --> 08:45.176
They didn't work
then and they
still fuckin' don't.

08:46.221 --> 08:48.528
This, however, does.

09:00.148 --> 09:04.369
Ah, I see Stefan still knows
his place.

09:07.111 --> 09:09.026
-And it's all here.

09:11.028 --> 09:13.030
If that little rat fucker
wants to continue

09:13.074 --> 09:14.075
to do business in my town

09:14.118 --> 09:15.555
he'll pay the
fuckin' toll.

09:18.470 --> 09:20.255
Don't seem so concerned.

09:21.735 --> 09:23.301
My ass is the one with the
fuckin' target painted on it.

09:23.345 --> 09:24.346
Have a drink.

09:35.009 --> 09:36.706
Is there anything else I can
do for you?

09:40.928 --> 09:42.494
Sir?
-Yeah?

09:42.538 --> 09:43.974
Is there anything else I can-

09:44.018 --> 09:46.498
Oh, oh. Yeah, yeah.

09:47.674 --> 09:49.153
Someone I need you
to check up on.

09:52.679 --> 09:54.506
<i>-Here's his number</i>

09:55.682 --> 09:57.509
Places you can
find him at.

10:38.159 --> 10:39.813
-Looking for something?
Hey!

10:40.335 --> 10:40.770
Johnny!

10:41.989 --> 10:42.816
Johnny, I-I'm in a
real bind man!

10:42.859 --> 10:43.817
Boss doesn't care.

10:45.253 --> 10:46.602
Do you have any idea how
important this is to him?

10:46.646 --> 10:47.995
Do you honestly thing I would
be here right now?

10:48.038 --> 10:50.084
No-I know this is really
I know you only do things

10:50.127 --> 10:51.433
whenever they're really
fuckin' important

10:52.042 --> 10:52.216
Right!

10:53.565 --> 10:54.523
And this is really fucking
important -Yeah!

10:54.566 --> 10:56.003
Cause you owe!
And you owe big.

10:56.046 --> 10:57.134
Boss says I can give you a
few more days

10:57.178 --> 10:58.179

10:58.919 --> 11:01.225
Thank-thank you.

11:02.357 --> 11:03.358

11:05.839 --> 11:07.492

basket from the boss.

11:08.232 --> 11:08.842
You'll deliver.

11:10.278 --> 11:11.975

You know the drill.

11:12.019 --> 11:13.063
Y-Yeah I can do that.

11:13.760 --> 11:14.586
-Good.

11:16.023 --> 11:17.024
Hey...

11:18.590 --> 11:19.766
Don't be looking for that
sweet stuff when you should

11:19.809 --> 11:21.202
be looking for Vincent's money.

11:23.073 --> 11:24.901
J-Johnny I, I don't
do that anymore.

11:24.945 --> 11:25.946
You know that.

11:29.819 --> 11:30.777
Goodbye, Jake.

11:33.127 --> 11:34.041

12:10.991 --> 12:11.861
Yeah.

12:13.428 --> 12:15.343
I mean my Dad used to watch
those like Elvis movies with me

12:15.386 --> 12:17.084
when I was little so I always

12:18.607 --> 12:20.217
...dreamed about picking up
and going with someone.

12:20.740 --> 12:21.566
Nice.

12:22.393 --> 12:24.004
Well I think you'll have fun.

12:24.482 --> 12:25.483
Yeah.

12:26.484 --> 12:28.051
I'd love to get out of here.

12:28.748 --> 12:29.487
Yeah you and me both.

12:33.056 --> 12:34.318
-Can I get you something?

12:37.452 --> 12:38.322
Miss?

12:38.366 --> 12:39.802
Can I have the check please?

12:41.499 --> 12:42.283
Okay.

13:01.911 --> 13:02.433
Hi honey.

13:03.173 --> 13:04.914
About damn time!

13:05.610 --> 13:07.177
Fucking where were you?

13:07.221 --> 13:09.179
-I was at the salon. Where
were you, here?

13:09.789 --> 13:10.093
Yes!

13:11.225 --> 13:12.008
Y-You gotta answer your phone,
okay?

13:12.879 --> 13:13.096
I'm sorry, I left it here.

13:14.184 --> 13:15.490
I-I'm in deep shit, okay?

13:16.926 --> 13:18.362
-yeah what does that mean
"I'm in deep shit?"

13:18.406 --> 13:21.017
It means that I owe Vincent
a lot of fucking money,

13:21.061 --> 13:23.759
and if I don't get it to him
he's going to kill me.

13:23.803 --> 13:24.978
Literally slit my throat.

13:25.021 --> 13:26.501
Innards everywhere!
-Okay, okay!!

13:26.544 --> 13:27.981
So measure that
-Okay! Just..

13:28.024 --> 13:29.852
into your lifes equation. So...

13:29.896 --> 13:34.030
Let's just take a breath,
and, and...um...

13:35.205 --> 13:35.945
What do you, what do you
propose that we do?

13:35.989 --> 13:37.468
I don't fucking know!

13:37.512 --> 13:39.993
I asked Ken for money but he's
a coke-head douche bag

13:40.036 --> 13:41.037
so he wouldn't give me any.

13:41.081 --> 13:42.647
Um, I asked uh...

13:42.691 --> 13:45.912
Stefan for a loan but he's still
pissed a-about the mule job

13:45.955 --> 13:47.261
that I fucked up which,

13:47.304 --> 13:49.437
how the FUCK was I supposed
to know that that

13:49.480 --> 13:52.962
dirty fucking JAP was a
GOD DAMNED RAT!?

13:54.094 --> 13:54.877
...Um

13:56.226 --> 13:57.662
- Okay well then, um, I could
take some more

13:57.706 --> 13:59.273
uh, shifts at the salon?

13:59.316 --> 14:01.753
No baby, that won't work.
We need money now!

14:02.493 --> 14:04.234
[PHONE RINGS]

14:07.194 --> 14:08.891
[PHONE RINGS]

14:09.718 --> 14:10.980
Are you gonna fucking get that?

14:11.024 --> 14:12.503
Let's, let's handle
one thing at a time

14:12.547 --> 14:14.114
-let's just let it go
to voicemail

14:14.157 --> 14:15.332
-I'll deal with
it in a second.

14:16.507 --> 14:17.726
[Voicemail]:
Hello, Tiffany?

14:17.769 --> 14:19.467
this is Marty,
uh, Mr. Maguffin.

14:19.510 --> 14:21.948
I know you've done a lot
for us and...

14:21.991 --> 14:24.951
I'd love to thank
you by taking you
for some dinner?

14:24.994 --> 14:27.127
Jamie loves you and I feel
I should do this

14:27.170 --> 14:30.304
so if you could call me at my
cell it'd be great.

14:31.044 --> 14:32.262
Yeah I'm sure.

14:33.481 --> 14:33.960
Hope to hear
from you soon!

14:34.656 --> 14:35.265
The fuck was that?

14:36.527 --> 14:38.138
That's that um, that dad of that
girl I babysit

14:38.181 --> 14:39.139
like three times a week.

14:40.488 --> 14:41.271
That rich little brat?

14:41.315 --> 14:42.316
-Yeah.

14:44.709 --> 14:46.668
He's so fucking weird, man

14:46.711 --> 14:50.672
he keeps on like, like trying
to get with me and

14:50.715 --> 14:53.022
he does't seem to understand
that I'm like

14:53.066 --> 14:55.982
way too young for him like,
like twenty years too young

14:56.025 --> 14:56.983
and I'm already dating-

14:58.071 --> 14:58.810
THAT'S IT!
-oh my god!

14:58.854 --> 14:58.985
That's fucking it!

14:59.507 --> 15:00.421
Seduce him.

15:01.552 --> 15:02.249
..What?

15:02.292 --> 15:04.773
N-n-no! Seduce him

15:04.816 --> 15:06.688
and then ask him for money,

15:06.731 --> 15:09.169
and he'll give it to you and
then we'll be free and clear

15:09.212 --> 15:10.257
I'm a fucking genuis!
-stop, STOP!

15:11.736 --> 15:13.216
I'm not going to go fuck some
other dude for money.

15:13.260 --> 15:14.391
I'm not going to go
fuck some other dude for
money. -No, shh!

15:14.435 --> 15:15.088
No I'm not saying fuck him.
God!

15:15.740 --> 15:16.959
Just, just seduce him

15:17.003 --> 15:18.700
and ask him for money,
it's that simple.

15:18.743 --> 15:20.441
Stop, no, I'm not gonna do that.

15:21.659 --> 15:23.139
You need to do this.
It's, it's gotta work.

15:23.183 --> 15:25.707
Okay? Baby? Please?
You owe me.

15:27.013 --> 15:28.623
Thats! -Whenever you left
home I took you in.

15:30.016 --> 15:31.626
Um, um that time that I fucking
bailed you out because

15:31.669 --> 15:33.410
your clepto-ass couldn't stop-
- Okay, okay, okay!

15:34.063 --> 15:35.108
I fucking..I, I get it.

15:35.151 --> 15:37.153
- I get it just, just shut up.

15:39.242 --> 15:40.635
C'mon baby please, okay?

15:40.678 --> 15:41.679
I love you.

15:42.550 --> 15:44.639
I love you and...

15:45.292 --> 15:46.946
I don't want to die.

15:47.468 --> 15:48.208
-so...

15:49.122 --> 15:50.427
..please baby?

15:53.213 --> 15:55.171
-I think I'm
being watched

15:55.215 --> 15:56.129
-Yeah by who?

15:56.912 --> 15:57.957
Cops?

16:01.786 --> 16:03.440
Put him down.

16:06.052 --> 16:09.011
Now explain to us how you
being watched by the cops.

16:15.452 --> 16:18.803
This morning, when I was at
the coffee house

16:20.109 --> 16:22.155
I-I peeked outside and I-I
saw a cop car

16:22.198 --> 16:23.634
just parked there, you know.

16:24.287 --> 16:25.375
J-just sitting there-

16:27.029 --> 16:28.988
Stop fuckin' mumbling and
get to the point.

16:29.858 --> 16:30.728
How you know it was a cop?

16:32.208 --> 16:33.775
T-the guy's a regular you know?

16:33.818 --> 16:35.907
He's been driving the same car
for two or three years.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.042
I thought maybe he was
just on the phone or somethin'

16:40.086 --> 16:41.957
but I saw him again on
my lunch break.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.263
only this time

16:44.742 --> 16:45.613
He was in an unmarked car
with two other guys.

16:46.831 --> 16:48.094
when I got home

16:49.051 --> 16:49.486
I recieved a call

16:51.010 --> 16:53.751
One of the young waitresses
said a detective came in

16:53.795 --> 16:56.493
and started asking questions
about the management.

16:59.801 --> 17:01.411
I-I hung up immediately when
I heard this! I-I

17:01.455 --> 17:02.543
I didn't know if I was
bugged or-

17:03.152 --> 17:03.413
You're coming with us.

17:09.028 --> 17:09.723
No..

17:11.117 --> 17:12.031
No.

17:15.077 --> 17:17.339
-No, no, no,

17:17.384 --> 17:18.340
NO!

17:23.520 --> 17:26.609
You stupid, slimey fuck.

17:28.395 --> 17:31.093
-You know I oughta rip
your fucking heart out.

17:33.139 --> 17:34.053
Motherfucker.

17:35.141 --> 17:37.056
How could you let this happen?

17:38.622 --> 17:39.754
You know I oughta just-

17:39.797 --> 17:42.061
Hey, hey! Just relax,
he's nervous.

17:43.497 --> 17:44.759
There's nothing wrong we still
have our connections.

17:45.977 --> 17:47.457
Now I can figure this out.

17:48.632 --> 17:49.459
-I don't think
it's that simple.

17:50.895 --> 17:53.159
I just got this, this morning.

17:53.202 --> 17:55.813
I think you have yourself
a rodent problem Vincent,

17:55.857 --> 17:57.293
Quite possibly a large one.

17:58.251 --> 17:58.990
The fuck is this?

17:59.817 --> 18:00.905
Evidence.

18:02.255 --> 18:03.647
Apparently someone's been
sticking their nose

18:03.691 --> 18:05.562
in your business and they've
given a wiff to the dogs.

18:06.389 --> 18:06.737
-Who gave you this?

18:08.391 --> 18:09.914
Luckily Vincent still has well
placed spiders who catch these

18:09.958 --> 18:11.394
things in their little webs.

18:12.178 --> 18:13.048
-Is this?

18:13.092 --> 18:14.963
Enough to arrest him? No.

18:16.182 --> 18:17.618
It is enough to push for a
search warrant though.

18:19.228 --> 18:20.403
Do we have anything here or at
the coffee house that they-

18:20.447 --> 18:21.143
There's some books and other
shit. BONES!

18:24.103 --> 18:26.192
Go there, clean house, make sure
you leave nothing for the

18:26.235 --> 18:27.410
fuckin' feds to find.

18:28.194 --> 18:29.151
Right away, sir.

18:29.195 --> 18:30.805
Hey! Tell Ray to do the
same here.

18:30.848 --> 18:31.806
Yes, sir.

18:33.068 --> 18:34.330
I may have something

18:34.374 --> 18:36.158
These emails were sent from
someone's phone.

18:37.333 --> 18:39.205
Whoever sent them missed
making it anonymous.

18:39.727 --> 18:40.206
-Really?

18:43.165 --> 18:43.818
So.

18:44.558 --> 18:46.037
Who's number is this?

18:46.995 --> 18:47.691
I don't-

18:47.735 --> 18:48.605
Who's fucking number-

18:48.649 --> 18:49.737
Just relax, I'll handle this.

18:50.999 --> 18:52.740
Do you know who's number
this is?

18:54.698 --> 18:56.222
Wait, let me check my phone.

19:03.533 --> 19:04.447
-Shit..

19:05.231 --> 19:06.188
Who?

19:06.232 --> 19:07.581
Tell us you fucking shit!

19:08.408 --> 19:08.973
-I-It's Primo's boy.

19:09.017 --> 19:09.931
WHO!?

19:10.236 --> 19:10.932
Sal!

19:11.759 --> 19:13.152
Who the fuck is Sal!?

19:13.195 --> 19:14.588
- Calm down or we'll never
figure it out.

19:17.373 --> 19:19.506
Are you talking about the guy
they found dead in November?

19:20.898 --> 19:21.595
Okay.

19:22.770 --> 19:25.076
You're telling me it's
that man's son?

19:25.120 --> 19:26.121
-Yeah.

19:27.340 --> 19:29.255
He's only worked for me since
December.

19:29.298 --> 19:32.040
I-I don't know. I just
wanted to help him.

19:33.128 --> 19:33.911
So what the fuck is he doing?

19:35.696 --> 19:37.480
He must blame you Vincent.

19:39.265 --> 19:39.830
What?

19:40.614 --> 19:40.788
-That makes sense.

19:42.006 --> 19:42.268
How the fuck does
that make sense?

19:43.834 --> 19:45.575
The shooting, down at the docks.
Crazy Cameron thought we had

19:45.619 --> 19:47.098
the feds there that night.

19:49.231 --> 19:50.885
I remember Primo's funeral.

19:52.278 --> 19:54.584
That kid had a look in his eye,
just like you do now.

19:54.628 --> 19:56.325
- So Vincent,what I think we
should do is-

19:56.369 --> 19:58.458
Fuck it, kid. Paulie you know
what

19:58.501 --> 20:01.200
you started this fuckin' shit.
Fix it.

20:05.291 --> 20:08.903
SCRAM! GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE
WHILE YOU CAN STILL FUCKING WALK

20:09.773 --> 20:10.339
-Vin.

20:12.080 --> 20:12.863
-Vin

20:12.907 --> 20:13.908
Fuck me.

20:14.387 --> 20:15.605
Look, Vin-

20:15.649 --> 20:17.694
All of you fuck OFF!
Get the fuck outta here!

20:29.706 --> 20:33.971
-A word?

20:46.157 --> 20:49.291
-Which speaking of
money, I'm going
to need some more.

20:49.335 --> 20:50.292
How much?

20:51.467 --> 20:52.816
Hundred thousand should clean up
this mess.

20:54.688 --> 20:55.993
Do you know who made you?
-Yes..

20:56.037 --> 20:57.865
and I would like to keep
it that way.

20:58.518 --> 20:59.214
Hundred thousand.

20:59.823 --> 21:00.215
Done.

21:00.955 --> 21:01.216
I may need more.

21:02.043 --> 21:03.349
Fine, what the fuck ever.

21:04.219 --> 21:05.264
Let me take you home, sir.

21:06.090 --> 21:07.091
We'll figure this out later.

21:09.050 --> 21:11.139
But I am in the middle-
-Come by tomorrow.

21:11.966 --> 21:13.272
Do not leave me out in the cold.

21:14.098 --> 21:14.447
I won't.

21:17.580 --> 21:19.408
Don't forget about the fucking
Mexican deal.

21:19.452 --> 21:20.496
- I'm already on it.

21:28.374 --> 21:30.071
â™ª

21:40.211 --> 21:41.952
-I don't know what Maurice
could have told you.

21:43.519 --> 21:45.521
I mean isn't that something
we do?

21:47.610 --> 21:48.611
Uh huh.

21:51.092 --> 21:52.398
Yeah check with him on that.

21:53.137 --> 21:53.529
I gotta go.

21:55.575 --> 21:58.708
- You seemed a little anxious
in there.

21:58.752 --> 22:01.232
I was beginning to think maybe
you were too busy.

22:02.146 --> 22:02.669
I'm never anxious.

22:03.365 --> 22:04.235
Look.

22:05.802 --> 22:07.282
They haven't shaken since
Vincent gave me his first job.

22:08.109 --> 22:09.893
Alright Mister no shakes.

22:16.117 --> 22:17.118
-What about you?

22:18.119 --> 22:19.338
Why were you so serious
back there?

22:20.295 --> 22:22.471
I take my business very
seriously.

22:24.212 --> 22:27.607
Oh I have not behaved like this
since like high school.

22:29.217 --> 22:30.261
Were you one of those future
business leaders of America?

22:30.305 --> 22:32.394
No, I was a lazy lazy smart kid.

22:33.090 --> 22:33.352
So a cheerleader?

22:34.483 --> 22:36.050
Captain of the
cheerleading squad.

22:36.398 --> 22:37.356
Oh yeah?

22:37.399 --> 22:38.357
Yeah.

22:42.230 --> 22:45.146
Hey, hey, hey, playtime is over
I have to get back to work.

22:48.628 --> 22:52.327
So, who were you?
Were you the nerd or the jock?

22:52.371 --> 22:53.894
Neither.

22:53.937 --> 22:56.287
I actually did my school work
and then I went to work.

22:59.160 --> 23:01.423
See it was only my mother and I
at that point

23:01.467 --> 23:03.033
and she wasn't making rent.

23:05.949 --> 23:06.863
Well that's no fun.

23:11.694 --> 23:12.652
You're tellin' me.

23:16.046 --> 23:17.178
Hey..

23:23.663 --> 23:27.406
â™ª

23:37.590 --> 23:40.201
- You know sittin' alone
with a cooler seems odd.

23:41.289 --> 23:42.203
Yeah well, what would you have
me do?

23:43.422 --> 23:43.944
For one I wouldn't send you
by yourself.

23:46.163 --> 23:47.121
Do you have something for me?

23:48.078 --> 23:49.079
Do you?

23:56.565 --> 23:57.174
Good?

23:57.784 --> 23:58.175
Good.

24:10.753 --> 24:12.059
Get in.

24:18.979 --> 24:19.936
It's all there.

24:20.459 --> 24:20.937
How do you know?

24:22.156 --> 24:23.244
Because I checked.

24:24.114 --> 24:25.115
- You can never check
too many times.

24:28.902 --> 24:29.642
Am I good?

24:30.338 --> 24:31.687
You're better, not good.

24:32.601 --> 24:34.124
I-I-I did everything you
told me.

24:35.038 --> 24:35.082
Shut the fuck up!

24:39.652 --> 24:41.218
This covers half.

24:42.176 --> 24:43.003
Half?!

24:44.526 --> 24:46.006
Boss had me take care of
things between you and Stefan.

24:46.833 --> 24:48.008
For that, he wants double.

24:49.444 --> 24:50.924
Yeah b-but Johnny, th-those
two don't make double.

24:52.099 --> 24:53.404
There's a helper's fee.

25:02.109 --> 25:04.503
We'll contact you again when
we have more work for you.

25:08.245 --> 25:11.074
Why don't you take a cue?
Get the fuck out.

25:34.271 --> 25:35.229
[Door Knocking]

25:35.708 --> 25:36.709
Gotta go.

25:37.536 --> 25:38.580
Yes?

25:40.364 --> 25:42.541
Dude, what the fuck are
you doing here?

25:43.237 --> 25:44.499
No, I just, I-I-I-

25:44.543 --> 25:46.980
N-nah nah. You've done
enough already.

25:48.721 --> 25:50.853
Our involvement with you
is over.

25:52.028 --> 25:53.900
I want to work for Stefan.
- Look

25:53.943 --> 25:57.077
Dude you're a fuck up.
Stefan's tired of your shit.

25:58.121 --> 25:59.645
No I-I know I ha I know
I'ma fuck up.

25:59.688 --> 26:01.821
But uh I-I,

26:01.864 --> 26:05.172
I can help. I can- I can do
whatever you need me to do just,

26:05.215 --> 26:07.391
I need I need I need something.

26:07.957 --> 26:08.784
Hmm.

26:17.140 --> 26:18.315
-Ross, what
are you doing?

26:18.359 --> 26:19.229
What?

26:20.579 --> 26:21.710
Why you sitting here like
this place is open?

26:22.885 --> 26:24.757
I don't know man,
I'm just visualizing.

26:26.280 --> 26:28.587
Visualizing? Ain't even no
fuckin' stripper on the pole.

26:29.805 --> 26:29.979
I wish there was a stripper
on the pole.

26:30.719 --> 26:31.285
Have you seen maurice?

26:32.373 --> 26:32.982
Nah man I ain't seen
him anywhere.

26:34.157 --> 26:35.419
Well you dumb fuck let's go see
him then.

26:35.463 --> 26:36.725
He's probably here in the back.

26:39.510 --> 26:41.600
Why the fuck are you wearing
sweat pants?

26:42.862 --> 26:44.733
It's easy access for the ladies.

26:46.126 --> 26:49.129
Ain't no fuckin' ladies
around here!

26:50.696 --> 26:51.348
-So have y'all already
made y'all's schedules?

26:52.741 --> 26:53.612
- Yeah, I turned mine into
Frank last night.

26:54.134 --> 26:55.135
- Yo! Maurice.

26:56.179 --> 26:57.137
Hello ladies.

26:58.007 --> 26:58.442
Sup Ross.
- What's up.

26:59.182 --> 26:59.705
- Gentlemen.

26:59.748 --> 27:00.575
- What's up man.

27:01.054 --> 27:01.794
How's it hangin?

27:02.621 --> 27:03.099
Hangin' low like my dick.

27:06.755 --> 27:08.104
Whatchu call us up here for?

27:09.758 --> 27:11.151
Look, I think you two guys needa
stay away from here for a while.

27:12.718 --> 27:14.328
Man, don't take this booty
away from me. - Ross, Ross.

27:14.937 --> 27:15.938
Why?

27:17.374 --> 27:18.680
Look you know Vincent has that
cop perched outside

27:18.724 --> 27:20.116
just waiting on me to
fuck up.

27:20.160 --> 27:21.161
- What cop?

27:22.771 --> 27:23.772
Cause Vincent don't send no
police after his bitches man.

27:23.816 --> 27:25.165
That's our thing.

27:26.688 --> 27:28.211
Well it's funny that the car
started showing up outside

27:28.255 --> 27:29.865
right around the same time y'all
started hanging around here.

27:30.736 --> 27:32.215
So I think y'all need to go.

27:33.260 --> 27:34.391
Man you're making a mistake.

27:35.218 --> 27:36.132
Man, we think you bullshitting.

27:37.438 --> 27:38.004
Y'all need to take y'all's
asses home.

27:38.526 --> 27:39.266
- Fuck you.

27:40.180 --> 27:41.181
- This some straight bullshit.

27:42.312 --> 27:43.313
- Can't believe this, man.

27:44.140 --> 27:45.228
Cannot fucking believe this.

27:46.752 --> 27:48.667
I know, man. All those fuckin'
titties and asses, man,

27:48.710 --> 27:50.059
left alone.

27:50.103 --> 27:51.278
- Can you stop thinking about
your tiny ass dick

27:51.321 --> 27:53.106
for two fuckin' seconds?
- Hello boys.

27:55.108 --> 27:57.240
Taking in the sights in there?

27:58.764 --> 28:01.027
Hey, you two better keep your
fucking heads on straight

28:01.070 --> 28:03.464
before they're chained straight.

28:04.639 --> 28:06.467
So you're the pig he was talking
about, huh?

28:10.863 --> 28:12.734
Watch your mouth
you little shit.

28:15.171 --> 28:16.825
Better stay out of trouble.

28:17.957 --> 28:18.827
Or else.

28:25.138 --> 28:26.748
Adios, motherfuckers.

28:27.880 --> 28:30.012
- You know something?

28:30.360 --> 28:31.013
What?

28:32.275 --> 28:33.102
The man's too small to be
messing with us?

28:33.799 --> 28:34.321
Nah.

28:35.888 --> 28:38.107
I think it's time we do a little
recon on Vincent's bitches.

28:39.848 --> 28:42.503
â™ª

28:55.472 --> 28:56.343
Get in.

29:03.263 --> 29:05.047
-What the hell
were you thinking?

29:05.569 --> 29:07.093
What?

29:07.136 --> 29:08.964
- I told you, the boss
dealt with Stefan for you

29:09.008 --> 29:10.313
and your job is to work for me.

29:10.357 --> 29:11.924
- Johnny, I do work for you.

29:11.967 --> 29:14.230
- If you are then why the fuck
were you meeting with him?

29:14.274 --> 29:16.929
- I didn't even meet with
Stefan. I-I only saw Solo.

29:17.799 --> 29:18.582
Why? It was taken care of.

29:20.149 --> 29:22.282
See, Johnny, I-I think this is
where I can help the boss.

29:22.325 --> 29:23.936
We need a guy on the inside,
right?

29:25.241 --> 29:26.112
I understand but you need to
keep you head on straight and

29:26.155 --> 29:27.200
you do what I say, you got it?

29:27.809 --> 29:29.071
Got it.

29:29.115 --> 29:30.290
You're on thin fucking ice
right now

29:30.333 --> 29:31.247
so don't bite of more than
you can chew.

29:31.857 --> 29:32.466
I know.

29:37.950 --> 29:38.951
What'd he say?

29:40.953 --> 29:42.389
Solo, what did he say to you?

29:42.432 --> 29:43.433
Oh oh.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.133
He said uh, if, if I wanted to
work with Stefan I need to

29:47.176 --> 29:49.613
sweeten the deal somehow.

29:53.095 --> 29:54.705
And how are you
going to do that?

29:56.011 --> 29:57.317
They thought I could tell them
what you're up to.

29:59.275 --> 30:00.581
[Laughter]

30:01.887 --> 30:02.844
Okay.

30:02.888 --> 30:03.845
- What?

30:05.281 --> 30:08.110
Nothin' just confirms
what we already knew.

30:11.853 --> 30:15.030
Wait. How did you know that I
was over there

30:15.074 --> 30:16.031
in the first place?

30:16.727 --> 30:17.816
Connections my man.

30:19.252 --> 30:20.688
They can make or break you
in this business.

30:27.260 --> 30:28.783
-Happy birthday, Grandpa

30:35.355 --> 30:37.139
I know what I'm doing?

30:37.879 --> 30:38.010
Says who?

30:40.055 --> 30:41.100
Do you like it?

30:42.101 --> 30:42.753
I love it.

30:44.190 --> 30:46.235
So. How are your parents?

30:47.149 --> 30:49.108
Good. I haven't been home much
lately,

30:49.151 --> 30:52.372
but they try to keep things
the way they used to be.

30:54.026 --> 30:54.722
How so.

30:55.941 --> 30:58.987
Well, they don't want me to
grow up

30:59.031 --> 31:00.336
and they don't want to move.

31:01.990 --> 31:02.861
Move?

31:04.297 --> 31:06.168
Well, neither of them is
getting much work lately.

31:07.604 --> 31:09.128
If you want I could-

31:09.171 --> 31:12.131
No, no no. They wouldn't want me
telling you.

31:13.697 --> 31:17.136
I won't tell. Besides, they
barely speak to me anyway.

31:17.963 --> 31:20.226
It's alright. I better be going.

31:22.706 --> 31:24.665
- Wait. How's your
dancing going?

31:26.101 --> 31:28.451
It's really great. We've been
practicing a lot lately.

31:29.017 --> 31:29.278
Good.

31:30.105 --> 31:31.237
Sorry, this is important.

31:35.371 --> 31:36.242
It's okay.

31:37.025 --> 31:37.634
But...

31:38.635 --> 31:40.115
Thank you for having me grandpa.

31:45.033 --> 31:45.816
What the fuck?

31:46.992 --> 31:48.080
I didn't mean to-
- Spit it out.

31:49.864 --> 31:50.734
Paulie's dead.

32:01.528 --> 32:02.529
Hello, Mr. Vitti.

32:04.052 --> 32:06.968
Hey Sal, is your mother home?

32:07.751 --> 32:08.927
No, why?

32:10.015 --> 32:12.278
Well actually I wanted
to talk to you.

32:19.067 --> 32:20.982
- Sal's gone missing.

32:21.026 --> 32:23.202
I'm not sure what the kid is
planning, if anything,

32:23.245 --> 32:24.246
but I think we should
be prepared.

32:25.726 --> 32:28.207
He shows his face again,
put a bullet in his fucking head

32:29.382 --> 32:30.905
Sir, I understand but it's not
that easy.

32:31.732 --> 32:33.342
- It's much simpler. Okay?

32:34.822 --> 32:37.042
No time for bullshitting around;
if he shows his fucking face

32:37.085 --> 32:39.783
again, he's fucking dead.
End of discussion.

32:39.827 --> 32:41.916
Besides we've got bigger fish
to fry.

32:42.482 --> 32:43.178
Like what?

32:44.179 --> 32:45.050
Like Raquel.

32:46.442 --> 32:47.748
- You have got to keep an eye
or two on Stefan.

32:47.791 --> 32:49.010
What?

32:49.054 --> 32:50.011
He's buying out the right people
Your people.

32:50.055 --> 32:51.752
- My people?
- Yes!

32:51.795 --> 32:53.928
I keep more and more through
cracks at the D.A.'s office.

32:53.972 --> 32:56.235
Cops, lawyers, judges
all working for him.

32:56.278 --> 32:57.888
-Hey Ken. Where the
fuck is he getting his money?

32:57.932 --> 32:59.586
his business can't be serving
him that well.

32:59.629 --> 33:01.196
- He musn't be working alone.

33:01.240 --> 33:02.284
No.

33:02.328 --> 33:03.024
- Well shit could
it be Bones or-

33:03.068 --> 33:04.591
Maybe.

33:04.634 --> 33:06.897
Do not forget that Solo is not
some Jo-shmo from Idaho.

33:06.941 --> 33:08.943
He's been keeping busy.

33:08.987 --> 33:12.077
It's either him or one
of those suits of yours.
They have the funds right?

33:12.425 --> 33:13.208
Alright.

33:14.775 --> 33:16.081
- Which speaking of money
I'm going to need some more.

33:16.777 --> 33:17.169
I'm going to call her.

33:17.908 --> 33:19.214
Oh I did.

33:19.258 --> 33:22.000
Raquel wants more money. Big
fucking surprise.

33:22.043 --> 33:24.306
Seems soom wise asses are
nosing around asking questions,

33:24.350 --> 33:26.700
and she's trying to dodge them
while being watched.

33:26.743 --> 33:29.137
You know what? For all I know
maybe she's the one fucking us.

33:30.008 --> 33:30.095
Let's just think this through.

33:31.879 --> 33:33.881
Enough dicking around
I'm too old to sit on
my fucking ass thinking.

33:37.276 --> 33:39.060
Oh fuck me, what?

33:39.887 --> 33:40.801
We talked to Pincher.

33:41.106 --> 33:41.715
And?

33:43.195 --> 33:45.023
Talk you little bitch!

33:47.547 --> 33:48.461
Fuckin' speak!

33:49.592 --> 33:50.854
I got this.

33:54.510 --> 33:55.337
[Gun cocks]

33:56.425 --> 33:57.122
Talk.

34:01.256 --> 34:03.389
I said fuckin' talk!
- Alright, alright!

34:06.957 --> 34:10.004
Okay. Alright, we want out.

34:10.483 --> 34:10.960
What people?

34:11.527 --> 34:12.440
Everyone.

34:14.094 --> 34:17.054
Everyone wants out, okay? We're
sick and tired of paying tribute

34:18.404 --> 34:21.623
We want our own racquets, and no
more Vincent getting his own cut

34:21.668 --> 34:24.018
and having to feel like we gotta
look over our shoulders

34:24.062 --> 34:25.802
all the time. Alright?

34:26.455 --> 34:29.023
Give me fucking names.

34:30.981 --> 34:32.853
Alright I'll give you names.

34:36.204 --> 34:38.076
Damn motherfucker headbutted me.

34:39.033 --> 34:39.947
- What happened to him?

34:40.600 --> 34:41.253
I fuckin' shot him.

34:44.908 --> 34:46.083
- A nigga's gotta react
to survive, man.

34:46.127 --> 34:48.260
Enough of this bullshit. Okay?
Enough.

34:49.130 --> 34:50.697
You know what's going to happen?

34:50.739 --> 34:52.916
I'm gonna cloud up and rain
all over these fuckers, okay?

34:52.960 --> 34:55.136
They're gonna pay me what they
fuckin' owe me.

34:56.485 --> 34:59.140
And I'll remind them who the
fuck is boss. We Clear?

34:59.184 --> 35:00.141
Alright?

35:01.142 --> 35:02.056
You!

35:02.100 --> 35:03.666
Clean this fucking shit up.

35:03.710 --> 35:04.624
You got it?

35:04.667 --> 35:06.713
Clean this fuckin' shit up now.

35:10.369 --> 35:11.848
- So what now, Johnny?

35:18.203 --> 35:21.119
It's okay. I'll handle this.

35:31.259 --> 35:32.521
Need some help?

35:33.957 --> 35:36.221
Yeah. It just died I think.

35:37.091 --> 35:38.266
Did you check under the hood?

35:39.833 --> 35:41.269
No, I just called somebody. I
figured it would be easier

35:41.313 --> 35:42.270
that way.

35:43.053 --> 35:43.880
Here let me try.

35:45.230 --> 35:46.622
But you don't even have a car.

35:47.449 --> 35:49.843
No I do, I just prefer to walk.

35:50.713 --> 35:51.845
Trying to save the earth?

35:52.802 --> 35:54.456
Trying to stay in shape.

35:59.200 --> 36:02.029
So what do you do for my
grandfather exactly?

36:02.072 --> 36:03.813
He never really told me what
you do.

36:04.640 --> 36:06.990
I just...ya know. Help him out.

36:07.034 --> 36:10.342
Get him places, make sure work
is serving him well.

36:10.385 --> 36:12.387
Ya know, keep things
in order for him.

36:13.823 --> 36:16.522
That's good. Somebody probably
should be doing that.

36:19.002 --> 36:20.743
You know how much you mean
to him right?

36:22.702 --> 36:24.312
Yeah. I do.

36:24.356 --> 36:28.186
It's not easy with my parents
disowning him and everything.

36:29.230 --> 36:32.494
I wish we could all hold hands
and sing Kumbaya but

36:32.538 --> 36:34.757
the world doesn't quite work
that way now does it.

36:35.280 --> 36:36.063
No, it doesn't.

36:41.199 --> 36:44.724
You're out of anti-freeze.
Just need to get more.

36:46.073 --> 36:47.248
Alright someone's probably
on their way.

36:49.163 --> 36:50.599
Well here let me wait with you.

36:51.296 --> 36:52.819
No, I-I couldn't impose.

36:53.298 --> 36:54.168
No I insist.

36:54.821 --> 36:57.171
Well then by all means.

37:06.963 --> 37:08.965
So what do you do in your
free time?

37:11.446 --> 37:12.230
Well

37:16.669 --> 37:18.236
I don't much free time.

37:19.106 --> 37:20.194
My grandpa overworking you?

37:21.239 --> 37:22.152
No, I like my job.

37:23.197 --> 37:25.025
Running someone else's errands?

37:26.156 --> 37:27.245
Keeping someone's things
together for them.

37:32.772 --> 37:34.295
-Voicemail: I feel I
should do this.

37:34.339 --> 37:37.080
So if you could call
me at my cell,
that'd be great.

37:38.299 --> 37:39.300
Hope to hear
from you soon.

37:41.781 --> 37:43.173
Honey.

37:43.478 --> 37:44.740
Honey.

37:44.784 --> 37:48.135
Getting ready for
my night shift.

37:49.354 --> 37:51.269
But honey. Jamie's still
at summer camp and...

37:51.312 --> 37:53.271
We got the whole house to
ourselves.

37:53.793 --> 37:55.011
I got you these.

37:55.055 --> 37:56.622
Thought we could spice things
up a bit.

37:57.623 --> 37:59.102
I have to go to work.

38:03.759 --> 38:06.414
Well I hope there's leftovers
in the fridge.

38:12.246 --> 38:13.291
Hello?

38:13.595 --> 38:15.641
â™ª

38:37.837 --> 38:40.013
Hey where are you?
I'm at the apartment.

38:42.972 --> 38:43.669
Wait.

38:44.365 --> 38:45.453
Wait what?

38:48.456 --> 38:50.110
Wait who are they?

38:51.546 --> 38:53.156
What things?

38:55.202 --> 38:56.246
Fuck.

39:02.731 --> 39:04.254
Hey Gill?

39:04.298 --> 39:05.908
Tell me you got something good.

39:07.170 --> 39:10.086
Hey babe I was thinking about
order some uh, some food.

39:10.130 --> 39:12.437
Maybe lo mein, would you
want anything?

39:12.480 --> 39:13.438
No.

39:14.308 --> 39:15.831
You serious? You're not hungry?

39:15.875 --> 39:17.267
No, I'm not hungry.

39:18.921 --> 39:21.359
I'm freakin' starving after all
this cray cray shit going down.

39:21.402 --> 39:23.099
Oh my god don't say that.

39:23.578 --> 39:24.797
You okay?

39:25.145 --> 39:25.754
Yeah.

39:29.236 --> 39:30.629
What's wrong?

39:31.717 --> 39:33.066
Can we just go?
Can we just go, please?

39:33.109 --> 39:34.937
Can we just pack up our stuff
and, and leave?

39:34.981 --> 39:37.766
Look, we need, we need to
take care of this stuff.

39:37.810 --> 39:40.334
We can't just leave it hanging
it will follow us

39:40.378 --> 39:42.205
wherever the fuck we go.

39:47.776 --> 39:48.995
Did you meet with Johnny?

39:50.170 --> 39:52.259
Yeah uh, He was a little
skeptical at first,

39:52.302 --> 39:55.567
but I'm pretty sure I'm gonna
be able to unfuck us. So...

39:55.610 --> 39:56.524
That's good.

39:57.351 --> 39:58.787
Some good news.

39:59.701 --> 40:01.094
Um, did you uh...

40:02.008 --> 40:03.139
Meet with the old guy?

40:03.183 --> 40:05.881
Yeah, it was great.

40:05.925 --> 40:08.406
He took me to dinner and-

40:08.449 --> 40:10.756
Um, is, is he gonna help?

40:10.799 --> 40:12.845
I mean I-I think so.

40:12.888 --> 40:15.804
It's really, it's really
complicated

40:16.457 --> 40:18.981
So his wife...

40:19.765 --> 40:21.506
Okay, let me just start over.

40:22.550 --> 40:25.248
His wife has these like
family jewels,

40:25.292 --> 40:28.948
and she's, she's been holding
onto them for a few years.

40:28.991 --> 40:31.472
She inherited from like her
grandparents or her

40:31.516 --> 40:33.256
great grandparents,
I don't know.

40:33.300 --> 40:38.218
But she spent like three fourths
of it on like clothers and

40:38.261 --> 40:41.134
jewelry and a bunch of stuff.
And now that she's got like

40:41.177 --> 40:43.441
this little portion left, she
doesn't want to get rid of it

40:43.484 --> 40:45.443
because it's got like
sentimental value.

40:45.486 --> 40:48.054
So she keeps it in this safe
that they have somewhere

40:48.097 --> 40:49.098
in their house.

40:50.622 --> 40:52.624
Wait, so you're gonna have
to steal the family jewels?

40:54.190 --> 40:56.715
I mean, that's-that's what he
wants to do.

40:58.630 --> 40:59.631
Ugh.

41:01.197 --> 41:02.416
Have you thought about it?

41:03.939 --> 41:06.420
Well uh, yeah I-I've though
about it but I mean w-what

41:07.987 --> 41:11.686
what am I supposed to do?
I'm not a-a theif per se.

41:11.730 --> 41:15.298
I don't know how to break into
somebody's safe in their house.

41:16.604 --> 41:18.345
But think about it though.

41:19.825 --> 41:24.307
I mean as soon as I get done
with Johnny's errands...

41:25.700 --> 41:26.875
and...

41:26.919 --> 41:28.486
And If I do this, then we can
just go.

41:29.922 --> 41:33.055
Yes, we'll have the money,
e-everything will be all tied up

41:33.099 --> 41:34.709
I wont owe anything to Vincent-

41:34.753 --> 41:38.713
And then we can move and change
our phone number and get a puppy

41:38.757 --> 41:41.107
and have a yard and a porch.
I want a porch.

41:41.150 --> 41:42.500
- I don't want a puppy.

41:42.543 --> 41:44.414
You don't want a puppy?
- I'm sorry I like cats.

41:45.372 --> 41:46.982
You can like bowl a cat.

41:47.026 --> 41:50.203
You can't, you can't cuddle
with a little kitty.

41:50.246 --> 41:51.247
S-stop.

41:53.685 --> 41:54.903
I hate you.

41:55.513 --> 41:56.557
I hate you too.

41:58.646 --> 42:02.563
â™ª

42:13.618 --> 42:14.662
[Whistle]

42:16.577 --> 42:17.839
So did you do as you was told?

42:19.972 --> 42:20.581
Yeah.

42:21.190 --> 42:21.713
And?

42:23.323 --> 42:24.411
They've got a shipment coming
into the warehouse tonight.

42:24.454 --> 42:25.760
They wanted me to help them
unload.

42:26.456 --> 42:27.240
And what about Solo?

42:29.677 --> 42:30.635
He'll be there.

42:31.505 --> 42:32.288
What about fucking Stefan?

42:33.812 --> 42:34.377
Stefan stays back at the
headquarters running numbers.

42:35.378 --> 42:36.815
It's true.
- It's true.

42:38.468 --> 42:39.252
They wanted to cut Vincent out
of it and that's why we didn't

42:39.295 --> 42:40.253
hear anything about it.

42:41.167 --> 42:41.515
What about the money?

42:42.168 --> 42:42.516
Jake's got a plan.

42:47.869 --> 42:48.696
She'll get him the money.

42:49.088 --> 42:49.654
When?

42:50.306 --> 42:51.264
Tonight.

42:51.307 --> 42:52.352
Tonight?
- Tonight?

42:52.395 --> 42:53.919
Yeah fucking tonight!
It's simple.

42:53.962 --> 42:56.138
h-he's got the access, and-and
the wife won't be there.

42:57.444 --> 42:58.880
Jake you know what happens
if you don't deliver right?

42:59.402 --> 43:00.882
You gonna be ok?

43:02.754 --> 43:05.060
Yeah. Johnny knows that I
can deliver.

43:05.408 --> 43:05.583
Does he?

43:06.671 --> 43:07.672
You know Imma send Colin
after his ass

43:07.715 --> 43:08.716
if I don't get it right?

43:10.936 --> 43:12.938
Yeah, he does.

43:15.157 --> 43:17.159
Well since you're so sure
you're gonna come with us.

43:17.203 --> 43:18.160
Let's roll Ross.

43:24.079 --> 43:25.298
Take a seat.

43:33.001 --> 43:35.177
She's still practicing. The rest
of them knocked off

43:35.221 --> 43:36.222
a half hour ago.

43:37.179 --> 43:38.572
She won't quit.

43:40.139 --> 43:42.924
Supposed to do some kind of
dance routine at a convnention

43:42.968 --> 43:43.969
in a couple weeks.

43:44.622 --> 43:45.318
That's nice.

43:47.320 --> 43:49.627
Yeah I suppose that some
big time dancers and
choroegraphers'll be there.

43:50.323 --> 43:51.193
I hope she does well.

43:51.977 --> 43:52.978
Oh she will.

43:54.544 --> 43:56.895
I've seem them rehease this
fucking thing two weeks already.

43:57.722 --> 43:58.984
You go to all the rehearsals?

43:59.680 --> 44:00.942
As many as I can.

44:02.161 --> 44:04.119
Never know when it'll be my last
time watching her.

44:06.905 --> 44:09.821
Just look at her.
She makes me so proud.

44:11.474 --> 44:14.434
You know when she came to me and
told me she was gonna do this,

44:16.131 --> 44:17.567
I saw that look.

44:18.830 --> 44:21.267
Fuck the world
this is mine look, you know?

44:22.268 --> 44:24.183
I couldn't help but get
behind her.

44:25.358 --> 44:28.578
Unlike my good for nothing
worthless ass son.

44:30.102 --> 44:32.278
Swear he's his mothers.

44:32.321 --> 44:36.195
Best part of him ran down
the crack of her fuckin' ass
on the night of conception.

44:37.152 --> 44:38.545
Not my doing.

44:40.112 --> 44:43.419
Anyways she came to me a few
months back asking if I had any

44:43.463 --> 44:46.727
empty office space she could use
for rehearsals.

44:46.771 --> 44:49.077
I know the guy who owns this
place,

44:49.121 --> 44:51.079
he owed me fuckin' big time.

44:51.776 --> 44:52.690
So I took it from him.

44:53.212 --> 44:54.213
Does she know?

44:55.301 --> 44:57.129
Course not.

44:58.478 --> 45:01.307
She has no idea what I do and
I'd like to keep it that way.

45:02.830 --> 45:04.571
I'm not explaining what I do
to her.

45:04.614 --> 45:06.747
She only vaguely knows how
I got to where I am.

45:07.269 --> 45:08.836
How's that?

45:10.055 --> 45:12.797
By doing whatever it takes.
Not stopping.

45:13.667 --> 45:14.886
You know, like she's doing.

45:16.061 --> 45:18.193
Like I've seen you do with
that fuckin' look.

45:20.065 --> 45:23.242
Course, I leave out all the
murder and shit.

45:24.373 --> 45:26.114
Makes no difference
in my opinion.

45:27.507 --> 45:29.291
There's something else.

45:30.292 --> 45:30.902
Hmm?

45:31.816 --> 45:33.252
Raquel's getting really paranoid

45:34.732 --> 45:37.604
She says there's a judge that's
really close to signing a

45:37.647 --> 45:39.301
warrant for your arrest.

45:40.607 --> 45:43.958
Someone's talking to the feds
and she can't find out who it is

45:48.267 --> 45:50.835
Ken, let's get this fuckin'
thing going.

45:51.966 --> 45:53.446
Yeah I'm working on that.

45:54.273 --> 45:55.274
No, no I'll let gill know.

45:56.318 --> 45:57.363
Alright.

45:58.146 --> 45:59.321
What do you mean?

46:03.543 --> 46:04.762
Yeah.

46:06.111 --> 46:07.068
- Okay.

46:12.073 --> 46:14.206
We got work to do now man.

46:15.598 --> 46:17.383
<i>-Done. I've had enough.</i>

46:18.601 --> 46:19.428
What do you mean
you've had enough?

46:21.039 --> 46:23.911
Life's too short to be worried
about rats and all these little

46:23.955 --> 46:26.784
fuckers talking to the
wrong people.

46:26.827 --> 46:30.222
You don't get to where I am
without making enemies, alright?

46:31.440 --> 46:34.748
But I can't, fuck it I won't,
leave my granddaughter.

46:36.054 --> 46:36.881
So what? You're just going to
kill everyone off?

46:36.924 --> 46:37.838
Yes.

46:39.797 --> 46:43.931
And no one's gonna get
in my way and you know
there's no way around it.

46:45.411 --> 46:49.110
You're fucking serious? There
has to be another way.

46:49.154 --> 46:51.852
I can fix this without bringing
the whole world down upon our

46:51.896 --> 46:55.160
heads. You just, you just gotta
keep your emotions in check.

46:56.901 --> 46:58.859
Think about the heat that it's
gonna put on this business.

46:58.903 --> 47:03.124
Enough, enough. This, okay? This
is how this business get's done.

47:05.257 --> 47:06.911
Or have you forgotten?

47:06.954 --> 47:08.956
I haven't forgotten
shit. I know exactly-

47:09.000 --> 47:10.479
Shut-shut your fuckin' mouth.

47:12.220 --> 47:15.267
Look kid, you don't want to get
knocked down from here any more

47:15.310 --> 47:17.225
than I do, so fucking fix this.

47:20.228 --> 47:21.316
Now fuck off.

47:23.797 --> 47:26.321
Assholes and elbows, get going.

47:40.335 --> 47:43.121
â™ª

51:29.042 --> 51:31.044
-Eve was fuckin'
great today.

51:32.350 --> 51:35.527
She's gonna kill down there.

51:36.745 --> 51:38.095
Absolutely.

51:38.965 --> 51:41.272
Where we head now, sir?

51:42.577 --> 51:46.712
Home's fine.
But you'll have to stay on.

51:46.755 --> 51:49.193
After tonight, the fucking
world changes,

51:49.236 --> 51:51.282
and I ain't getting smoked
in my sleep.

51:57.026 --> 51:58.593
- Hey what's up?

52:03.207 --> 52:04.121
It's done.

52:05.078 --> 52:06.297
That's good.

52:09.213 --> 52:14.043
Son of a bitch fought another
battle and came out on top.

52:17.308 --> 52:21.138
Always had a good feeling about
that kid, first time I met him.

52:22.139 --> 52:24.532
I'd seen him around some.

52:26.534 --> 52:30.582
His dad was a degenerate fucking
doper and his shit caught up
with him so ended up locked up.

52:32.105 --> 52:36.153
I never really took a good look
at the kid till that night.

52:37.284 --> 52:40.026
Fifteen and a fucking man
already.

52:41.158 --> 52:43.290
Never saw a kid hold up
like that.

52:44.030 --> 52:46.337
Yeah, I can see that.

52:47.555 --> 52:50.950
Shit I told him that night come
work for me.

52:50.993 --> 52:53.996
He wanted more than a job type
fucking job.

52:55.476 --> 52:57.870
So we kept in touch through
the years.

52:57.913 --> 53:00.133
He went on and got his M.B.A.

53:00.177 --> 53:02.179
He's fuckin' genius.

53:02.962 --> 53:03.702
Prodigy.

53:05.182 --> 53:07.662
Wasn't long till I realized
what he was made for.

53:08.446 --> 53:10.491
- and what's that, sir?

53:11.188 --> 53:12.885
Getting shit done.

53:15.192 --> 53:18.238
My old driver, the dead one.

53:19.196 --> 53:21.763
brought me there to
his graduation.

53:21.807 --> 53:25.245
So he was doing all this fucking
song and dance, you know,

53:25.289 --> 53:28.248
graduation ceremonies. It took
him a while to make his way

53:28.292 --> 53:29.423
over to my car.

53:30.990 --> 53:35.212
I let him in, he handed me
his diploma without a word.

53:36.822 --> 53:38.737
I still got that motherfucker.

53:39.651 --> 53:41.218
He's a god damned beast
like me.

53:43.350 --> 53:44.351
But he's smarter.

53:49.313 --> 53:52.533
It's why I brought him into
this business, to inherit it.

53:54.056 --> 53:56.276
Him and Eve make me so fucking
proud.

53:57.495 --> 53:59.497
It's nice to see shit
shaping up for a change.

54:01.977 --> 54:06.547
Hey Vin, I've been meaning to
ask you something.

54:07.592 --> 54:08.549
Shoot.

54:12.379 --> 54:14.860
If you could do this all over
again,

54:16.340 --> 54:20.518
even after all this shit,
would you?

54:22.346 --> 54:24.391
Even with all this shit...

54:26.654 --> 54:30.179
Fuckin' A, I absolutely would.
And fuck em' all!

54:31.659 --> 54:34.314
When push comes to shove it's
either put up or shut up.

54:35.359 --> 54:38.971
So I put up, and they shut the
fuck up. Simple.

54:47.632 --> 54:49.286
-Did you bring
what I asked?

54:51.549 --> 54:52.245
Good.

54:53.812 --> 54:56.336
Now, I've parked down here
so my wife won't hear the car.

54:56.380 --> 54:59.861
Don't worry, I've seen this done
on TV,

54:59.905 --> 55:01.254
it'll work.

55:01.298 --> 55:03.778
Besides, my wife's like the
worst cop ever, so,

55:03.822 --> 55:05.171
she won't even notice.

55:06.390 --> 55:09.001
[Voice] -Oh my
god, Marty?!

55:09.958 --> 55:10.959
-Marty!!

55:40.424 --> 55:45.385
Yeah baby, it's me. Umm.
I'm sorry I'm not home yet

55:47.213 --> 55:49.476
but ah, I-I just had to
take care of a couple
of things for the boss.

55:50.956 --> 55:54.133
Thinks have just got a little
bit crazy, people are uh,

55:55.221 --> 55:58.093
umm, doesn't matter I'm fine.

55:58.137 --> 56:02.707
I'm fine and we're gonna get
out of here and I'l-I'll

56:02.750 --> 56:05.536
be home soon t-to get you and,
and

56:05.579 --> 56:07.842
things are gonna be great, okay?
So uh,

56:09.191 --> 56:10.410
Yeah.

56:10.454 --> 56:13.239
I love you, and I'll
see you soon. Bye.

56:26.165 --> 56:27.253
Yeah?

56:28.080 --> 56:29.386
Ross tells me you did well.

56:30.212 --> 56:30.822
I did what you told me to do.

56:31.953 --> 56:32.737
Good, cause we got more work
to do.

56:35.348 --> 56:36.131
What do you mean we have mo-

56:36.175 --> 56:37.219
- Jake shut the fuck up!

56:38.917 --> 56:39.526
- Okay.

56:40.701 --> 56:42.399
Time to take care of one more
witness.

56:43.922 --> 56:45.576
Who? Who, Johnny?

56:45.619 --> 56:48.405
What other witnesses could there
possibly be?

56:49.144 --> 56:49.667
Your girl.

56:53.540 --> 56:54.280
Now uh-

56:55.412 --> 56:56.282
I'm sorry Jake but she's
seen too much.

56:58.110 --> 57:00.242
What do you mean? She-she-
hasn't done anything
she's not a threat.

57:01.113 --> 57:01.766
What do you want me to say,
Jake?

57:04.333 --> 57:06.074
It's our job in this business to
keep the heat

57:06.118 --> 57:07.902
off our business
so we have a job.

57:10.209 --> 57:11.950
Sometimes we gotta
make sacrifices.

57:13.168 --> 57:15.344
Sacrif-What sacrifices have you
made you fuck?

57:15.388 --> 57:17.521
I understand that you like her,

57:18.739 --> 57:20.001
but you're in the
wrong business.

57:20.828 --> 57:22.439
Like? She's my girlfriend.

57:22.482 --> 57:24.963
- That's the way
the dice rolled!

57:29.402 --> 57:30.838
Just take care of it.

57:33.232 --> 57:34.059
Fuck you.

57:44.548 --> 57:46.114
â™ª

58:00.564 --> 58:04.263
You know, isn't normal for
enemies to share secrets.

58:10.487 --> 58:12.401
They say there's a monster in
this house.--

58:14.142 --> 58:15.840
-They say he has scales,

58:15.883 --> 58:16.884
large fangs.

58:18.190 --> 58:19.800
And yet,

58:20.975 --> 58:22.237
No one can ever find him.

58:24.196 --> 58:26.894
Is there such a man who has seen
this bloody beast?

58:31.159 --> 58:33.858
Think you should stick to your
job. Do as your paid.

58:34.554 --> 58:35.990
Thank you.

58:37.252 --> 58:38.558
You've done a service for both
your community

58:38.602 --> 58:40.342
and for this man's career.

58:41.822 --> 58:43.302
Say hi to Vincent for me.

59:11.635 --> 59:14.333
You're more like, like a
Billy Crystal type.

59:14.376 --> 59:16.422
Hey fuck you man! I ain't no
Billy Crystal.

59:16.465 --> 59:19.381
Hey, Gill?

59:20.339 --> 59:21.122
Yeah.

59:22.254 --> 59:23.516
You fucking look like
Chris Tucker.

59:24.256 --> 59:25.126
- But littler.

59:25.779 --> 59:27.215
I'm with Ross, why?

59:29.304 --> 59:31.350
Babe? We gotta go.

59:31.393 --> 59:33.961
Hey! Baby?

59:35.920 --> 59:37.051
C'mon we...

59:41.882 --> 59:43.231
Yeah this is straight...

59:44.232 --> 59:45.233
Fuck!

59:48.759 --> 59:50.064
What number is it?

59:50.717 --> 59:51.544
Think he said 210

59:51.588 --> 59:52.501
You think or you know?

59:52.545 --> 59:53.546
Yeah look for 210

01:00:00.684 --> 01:00:01.815
Man I'm hungry, man.

01:00:01.859 --> 01:00:03.251
Go to Bojangles after this?

01:00:08.517 --> 01:00:09.301
Shit!

01:00:09.867 --> 01:00:10.302
Fuck!

01:00:12.086 --> 01:00:13.000
[Vincent Voice Over:]
There are two
fucking important

01:00:13.044 --> 01:00:13.958
choices in life.

01:00:16.047 --> 01:00:18.005
Either do, or don't.

01:00:19.311 --> 01:00:20.791
And I've seen too much
of the latter

01:00:20.834 --> 01:00:21.792
not to be in
on the former.

01:00:24.098 --> 01:00:28.189
And for that, these
people here know me
pretty fucking well.

01:00:31.802 --> 01:00:33.412
And the trick to it,

01:00:33.455 --> 01:00:35.632
isn't the choice
you make.

01:00:38.765 --> 01:00:40.854
But what choice you can
live with.

01:00:47.948 --> 01:00:50.690
These sons of bitches
know what I'll do
if they screw with me.

01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:54.302
I mean I've done it time
and time again

01:00:54.346 --> 01:00:55.913
and another time
won't fuckin' kill me.

01:00:58.132 --> 01:00:59.177
It's what I know.

01:01:00.352 --> 01:01:01.353
Not love,

01:01:02.267 --> 01:01:03.616
but fear and passion.

01:01:05.139 --> 01:01:06.924
This passion gave me the
strength to do

01:01:06.967 --> 01:01:08.142
what others wouldn't do.

01:01:08.186 --> 01:01:10.362
I mean fuck it, it got me
what I wanted.

01:01:12.843 --> 01:01:14.061
But you see the
difference,

01:01:15.889 --> 01:01:17.761
I mean the real
difference between
me and every other cunt

01:01:17.804 --> 01:01:19.501
isn't that I don't
have regrets.

01:01:19.545 --> 01:01:21.373
I mean, I got my share.

01:01:22.591 --> 01:01:23.505
It's that I can
live with them.

01:01:24.419 --> 01:01:25.638
Despite those
other cunts.

01:01:28.902 --> 01:01:31.078
I mean most people
I've associated
with are either dead

01:01:31.122 --> 01:01:32.079
or on their way out.

01:01:34.125 --> 01:01:36.257
Don't matter to me
because I wanted
something I could call my

01:01:36.301 --> 01:01:37.911
own apart from the norm.

01:01:39.217 --> 01:01:40.522
And I got it, I
shit you not.

01:01:50.707 --> 01:01:55.059
This drive I have will
live on in Eve,
my perfect angel.

01:01:56.277 --> 01:01:57.583
Who'll use my
talents for good.

01:01:59.324 --> 01:02:02.153
You know, despite
everything, I wouldn't
change a thing even

01:02:02.196 --> 01:02:04.198
if it meant
living another
thousand years.

01:02:05.765 --> 01:02:06.723
â™ª

01:02:20.301 --> 01:02:23.087
I've tasted grateness,
now I'm full.

01:02:23.914 --> 01:02:25.437
I'm finished.

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:26.743
and I ain't sorry.

01:02:29.267 --> 01:02:31.182
If you think that makes
me a monster...

01:02:32.923 --> 01:02:34.359
Fuck you.

01:02:37.623 --> 01:02:39.146
- Let's take you in now.

01:04:10.629 --> 01:04:12.587
-I think he has
to walk...Yeah.

01:04:14.154 --> 01:04:15.677
- Better, not good.

01:04:15.721 --> 01:04:17.331
- But I did everything you...

01:04:18.985 --> 01:04:20.378
- This only covers half...

01:04:21.945 --> 01:04:22.946
- Half?

01:04:24.512 --> 01:04:26.253
We gotta cut, we gotta cut.

01:04:28.168 --> 01:04:31.084
But-uh I-I can do more, I uh...

01:04:34.305 --> 01:04:35.828
- Yeah start over.

01:04:36.655 --> 01:04:38.439
Think you should stick to you-

01:04:39.788 --> 01:04:42.704
- Bout damn time. Where the fuck
were you?

01:04:43.357 --> 01:04:45.751
I was at the salon.

01:04:47.753 --> 01:04:49.407
That was a great catch!

01:04:50.364 --> 01:04:52.236
It's the choices you can
live with.

01:04:53.541 --> 01:04:55.108
And I just went completely blank

01:04:56.022 --> 01:04:58.372
Is it further than your tiny di-

01:04:59.286 --> 01:05:01.114
I cannot fucking believe
this, man.

01:05:02.463 --> 01:05:04.291
I know, I was about to bring
that big ol' ass home, man.

01:05:05.031 --> 01:05:05.292
Can you jus-

01:05:08.730 --> 01:05:10.210
I know man, all those
big asses and wet pussies man

01:05:10.254 --> 01:05:12.734
I know man all that fucking
wet pussy in there.

01:05:12.778 --> 01:05:15.476
I know man all those fucking
nice sweet titties, man.

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:16.913
I just wanna suck on em'

01:05:16.956 --> 01:05:18.871
Man I was about to bring that
big ol' ass home.

01:05:18.915 --> 01:05:21.526
Man I was about to
get my fuckin' dick
wet in that wet pussy.

01:05:22.875 --> 01:05:24.224
Ah man all that fuckin' wet
pussy in there.

01:05:25.965 --> 01:05:27.924
I know man, all those
fucking titties and
asses, man, left alone.

01:05:29.751 --> 01:05:31.623
I know man all that fucking
wet pussy just fuckin'
sitting there without us.

01:05:32.798 --> 01:05:34.408
Man all those fuckin' titties
and asses,

01:05:34.452 --> 01:05:35.932
I feel like we're being
kicked out of paradise.

01:05:35.975 --> 01:05:37.281
I know man that fucking pussy
was so wet I was about

01:05:37.324 --> 01:05:39.196
I was about to fucking
take that butt home!

01:05:40.371 --> 01:05:42.503
God damn I wanna suck on those
fucking titties, dude.

01:06:00.086 --> 01:06:02.436
Looks like playtime's over for
me too, see?

01:06:06.875 --> 01:06:08.138
Playtime?

01:06:08.181 --> 01:06:09.139
- Over.

01:06:09.835 --> 01:06:10.705
- And do as you're paid.

01:06:10.749 --> 01:06:11.793
Thank you.

01:06:13.012 --> 01:06:15.362
You've done your community
and this-

01:06:16.189 --> 01:06:17.669
And this man's service-

01:06:17.712 --> 01:06:19.149
and you've done it all!

01:06:19.845 --> 01:06:20.585
Yes! Done it all!

01:06:22.065 --> 01:06:23.240
Get the fuck out!

01:06:26.330 --> 01:06:29.942
Ah fuck I had my seat belt on
the whole god damn time.

01:06:31.074 --> 01:06:32.640
Shit!

01:06:32.684 --> 01:06:33.990
I thought maybe he was just on
the phone or something, but

01:06:35.469 --> 01:06:37.341
Then I saw him again on my
lunch break.

01:06:37.689 --> 01:06:37.863
Cut!

01:06:39.473 --> 01:06:41.823
And if I don't get it to him,
then he is going to kill me.

01:06:41.867 --> 01:06:44.652
Literally slit my throat
- He...

01:06:44.696 --> 01:06:47.133
Don't tell me what Vincent will
or won't do!

01:06:47.177 --> 01:06:48.178
-Cut!

01:07:00.059 --> 01:07:01.017
-Cut!

01:07:17.859 --> 01:07:18.295
-Cut!

01:07:20.123 --> 01:07:20.906
No!

01:07:22.125 --> 01:07:23.213
-Cool, cut.

01:07:27.826 --> 01:07:29.523
-Ooh yaa....

01:07:31.264 --> 01:07:32.004
-Cut!

01:07:34.963 --> 01:07:37.401
Noo!

01:07:55.114 --> 01:07:57.377
Just relax

01:07:58.509 --> 01:08:00.032
-Cut!

01:08:00.076 --> 01:08:04.297
You know, it isn't normal for
enemies to have secrets.

01:08:06.299 --> 01:08:07.866
Go back.

01:08:07.909 --> 01:08:09.520
Cause they don't have secrets
they gotta share secrets!

01:08:10.521 --> 01:08:11.478
-I was good with it!

01:08:22.402 --> 01:08:24.187
Fuck! No! No.

01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:26.014
- Yeah bitch I'm alive!

01:08:27.493 --> 01:08:28.930
Ah shit.

01:08:33.152 --> 01:08:34.719
My bad.

01:08:38.243 --> 01:08:39.462
Fuck, line.

01:08:40.290 --> 01:08:41.203
Let me tell you something, man.
