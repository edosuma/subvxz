WEBVTT

00:04.796 --> 00:06.798
- What's Carver Edlund's real name?
- Chuck Shurley?

00:07.007 --> 00:08.850
Who gave you the rights
to our life's story?

00:09.092 --> 00:11.936
One day these books, they'll be
known as the Winchester Gospel.

00:12.095 --> 00:14.268
You wanna know what she is, Crowley?
How about God's sister?

00:14.431 --> 00:15.683
He has relatives?

00:15.933 --> 00:17.435
So what? She shows up and
everybody goes 28 Days Later?

00:17.601 --> 00:19.603
This is Metatron. Scribe of God.

00:19.770 --> 00:21.772
We have your grace.
You're mortal now.

00:21.939 --> 00:24.488
- The indignities.
- I’m looking for God.

00:24.691 --> 00:26.443
He didn't feel the need to
show up for the apocalypse.

00:26.610 --> 00:28.863
He just doesn't think it's his problem.

00:29.112 --> 00:30.329
Why would he give a crap now?

00:30.531 --> 00:32.290
I don't know.
Maybe because she's his sister.

00:32.491 --> 00:34.289
All your chosen are suffering!

00:34.493 --> 00:36.370
Don't count on God. Count on us.

00:36.620 --> 00:38.088
Maybe now he'll hear me.

01:02.229 --> 01:04.903
Pastrami. Maybe.

01:37.055 --> 01:38.352
I give up!

01:49.860 --> 01:55.037
Yeah, Toto. I got a feeling
we aren't on Earth anymore, either.

02:07.210 --> 02:08.211
Hello?

02:16.928 --> 02:18.271
Carver Edlund?

02:19.431 --> 02:21.980
What the hell is going on here?
What is this place?

02:22.225 --> 02:23.568
It's a bar. Actually...

02:23.810 --> 02:28.065
It's not just a bar, genius. This is
one of the big man's constructs.

02:28.732 --> 02:31.406
I'd know his work anywhere.
We were besties, you know.

02:31.902 --> 02:33.245
Well, I wouldn't exactly say...

02:33.403 --> 02:36.748
This is some kind of punishment,
isn't it? For my sins?

02:37.407 --> 02:41.958
A limbo where I get to spend eternity
in a crappy bar with a hack writer.

02:42.913 --> 02:44.290
- Dude.
- Sorry, Chuckles.

02:44.498 --> 02:47.627
Not just any hack writer.
A prophet of the Lord.

02:48.335 --> 02:49.757
Give me a break.

02:51.088 --> 02:53.682
Tell me at least the beer is real in here.

02:56.259 --> 02:57.806
You really think I'm a hack?

02:58.011 --> 03:01.811
I have trudged through
your complete oeuvre.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.610
Published and unpublished.

03:05.602 --> 03:09.152
Of the metric ton of books
I've read in my lifetime,

03:09.773 --> 03:16.122
Supernatural didn't even crack
the top 10... Thousand. Respectfully.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.218
- You didn't like any of it?
- Mmm-mmm.

03:19.449 --> 03:21.292
- Not even "Home"?
- No.

03:21.493 --> 03:22.790
Or "All Hell Breaks Loose"?

03:22.953 --> 03:24.955
Oh, way too much melodrama.

03:26.123 --> 03:28.797
And then you put yourself
in the story. God!

03:28.959 --> 03:31.633
Okay. That's fair. Mildly constructive.

03:32.879 --> 03:35.849
Still doesn’t justify you burning
one of my books, though.

03:37.676 --> 03:38.756
What are you talking about?

03:39.136 --> 03:43.812
Tall Tales. You were monologuing it
to Castiel and you threw one in the fire.

03:45.976 --> 03:47.319
How do you know about that?

03:47.894 --> 03:51.489
Oh, I'm sorry. I always forget. People
can't see me unless I want them to see me.

03:51.815 --> 03:54.739
It's very confusing. Here, visual aid.

03:55.485 --> 03:59.661
Put these on. It'll help. Go on.
Just do it. It's a whole thing.

04:09.750 --> 04:13.254
You... God...

04:20.677 --> 04:23.180
God... You've come back.

04:26.850 --> 04:28.443
I can't believe you've come back.

04:28.769 --> 04:32.194
I didn't mean what I said
about Supernatural. It's underrated.

04:32.355 --> 04:34.528
Due for a reboot. And this bar?

04:34.775 --> 04:39.030
It's not crappy at all. It's just like the
one in Cheers, everybody knows my name!

04:39.237 --> 04:41.035
- And the lights are very forgiving...
- Okay, yeah. Please.

04:41.239 --> 04:44.413
All the kneeling and stuff, it's always
made me deeply, deeply uncomfortable.

04:45.035 --> 04:48.881
Just don't use the G-word, okay?
Just... Just call me Chuck.

04:51.374 --> 04:52.967
- Chuck?
- Chuck.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.263
I think I need a stiffer drink.

05:08.391 --> 05:10.393
Oh, perfect. We're gonna need our suits.

05:11.061 --> 05:12.654
Tell me you got something on Amara.

05:12.896 --> 05:16.571
Uh, it's a long shot, but clock's ticking,
right? Whatever Amara's doing to Lucifer.

05:16.942 --> 05:18.222
Beating on Cass in the meantime.

05:19.069 --> 05:22.448
Yeah. Uh, Hope Springs, Idaho.
Guy named Wes Cooper killed himself

05:22.614 --> 05:25.788
after killing a coworker. According to
reports, though, nobody knows why.

05:25.951 --> 05:29.171
Apparently, he was a perfectly happy guy,
and then, snap.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.252
- So what? Possession?
- Or he was soulless.

05:31.498 --> 05:33.751
Well, it ain't much,
but given what we got? I'll take it.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.420
- Yeah.
- Here you go.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.092
Thanks.

05:43.134 --> 05:45.603
Dude, quit ironing my shirts with beer!

05:51.643 --> 05:54.271
So what you been up to?

05:54.437 --> 05:55.438
Oh, I've been super busy.

05:55.605 --> 05:57.107
- Yeah, I traveled.
- Mmm-hmm.

05:57.274 --> 06:00.448
Uh, I started a blog.
Mostly just pictures of cats.

06:00.694 --> 06:01.946
Oh.  So cute.

06:02.153 --> 06:04.155
And, oh, I signed up for Snapchat.

06:04.781 --> 06:08.661
And I started a new series of books.
Yeah. Revolution.

06:10.620 --> 06:11.980
I don't think it's going anywhere.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.457
- "Revolution"?
- Yeah.

06:13.665 --> 06:17.135
Supernatural. Maybe titles
aren't your thing.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.800
You're not wrong.

06:23.008 --> 06:26.228
But why did you put on the Chuck suit
in the first place?

06:26.845 --> 06:28.643
How did that make any sense to you?

06:29.639 --> 06:33.314
I like front row seats. You know,
I figured I'd hide out in plain sight.

06:34.060 --> 06:37.030
You know. Plus, you know, acting is fun.

06:39.566 --> 06:42.490
Well, it's an Oscar-worthy performance.

06:43.820 --> 06:47.040
But how did nobody know?

06:47.324 --> 06:50.328
I mean, what about that Amulet thingy?
You told me about it.

06:50.493 --> 06:55.750
Some silly charm that
"Burned brightly in the presence of you."

06:56.666 --> 06:59.089
- You mean this?
- Yes! Dean had it.

06:59.753 --> 07:03.098
And your fave, Castiel.
They were around you, how did it never...

07:03.340 --> 07:05.434
I turned it off. See?

07:09.846 --> 07:11.348
I should really put this away.

07:11.681 --> 07:14.355
You'll never guess where
this thing has been this entire time.

07:14.517 --> 07:17.191
Look, I don't care
about that ugly old thing,

07:17.354 --> 07:20.028
or why you were
slumming it with the plebes.

07:20.231 --> 07:22.609
Let's brass some tacks already, okay?

07:25.445 --> 07:27.698
You see and hear all.

07:29.449 --> 07:32.874
You know what an absolute piece of garbage
I've been the last couple of years.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.624
Did you bring me here to destroy me?

07:40.627 --> 07:44.803
You know what humanity's
greatest creation has been?

07:47.801 --> 07:49.053
Music.

07:49.803 --> 07:53.899
That and nacho cheese. Even I couldn't
have dreamt up that deliciousness.

07:54.933 --> 07:57.732
But music is magic.

07:59.229 --> 08:03.234
A lot of remarkable music
was created in this space.

08:04.442 --> 08:05.739
Bee Gees' Canteen.

08:06.152 --> 08:09.497
Now, it's not as well-known as
The Bitter End or The Gaslight.

08:09.739 --> 08:12.663
But some amazing musicians
got their start on this stage.

08:13.493 --> 08:17.088
I'm hoping that you and I can tap into
some of that old magic

08:17.247 --> 08:19.750
and finish what I started
a few months ago.

08:29.092 --> 08:30.594
You wrote your autobiography?

08:30.760 --> 08:34.434
Ish. I mean, they're chapters,
it's kind of a loose structure.

08:34.597 --> 08:38.318
Uh, but somethings missing. I'm stuck.

08:39.436 --> 08:44.363
You wanna get the old band back together.
Lennon and McCartney ride again.

08:44.774 --> 08:48.119
Well, I'm kind of Lennon
and McCartney, so...

08:48.445 --> 08:49.947
But every writer needs a good editor.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.624
I did some of my best work
with you, Metatron.

08:53.283 --> 08:54.963
Does this mean I get to be an angel again?

08:56.536 --> 08:58.379
No. No. That's never, ever happening.

08:58.621 --> 09:00.464
- It's probably a good call.
- I think so.

09:04.461 --> 09:05.633
Well...

09:09.299 --> 09:10.471
Let's do this.

09:13.678 --> 09:16.147
Appreciate the FBI taking
an interest in this case.

09:16.514 --> 09:18.642
We don't really see things
like this around here.

09:19.142 --> 09:20.815
Hey, you mind if I knock off, Sheriff?

09:21.478 --> 09:24.322
Let me guess, Art's back? Newlyweds.

09:25.190 --> 09:27.550
You can head home after you
show Agent Greer the M.E. files.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.493
- Thank you, sir.
- Thanks.

09:30.487 --> 09:31.909
What do you have on Wes Cooper?

09:32.155 --> 09:33.748
We talked to his friends and family.

09:34.324 --> 09:37.077
Nobody can make heads or tails
of why he'd do this.

09:37.494 --> 09:41.169
We have a witness who overheard Wes
before he took his own life.

09:41.498 --> 09:43.876
He was saying things that
sounded "Out of character."

09:44.084 --> 09:45.084
Yeah, how so?

09:45.251 --> 09:49.006
Wes said that his life was meaningless,
nobody loved him.

09:49.589 --> 09:54.516
It was like every negative thought he
ever had came spilling out. Thing is...

09:54.719 --> 09:57.848
I knew Wes's wife.
We sang in choir together.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.192
She loved Wes till the day she died.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.227
I don't know why
he'd say anything like that.

10:02.519 --> 10:05.363
And then, there's this.

10:05.563 --> 10:08.863
Hold on a second. I've actually
seen something like that before.

10:10.360 --> 10:14.206
Deputy, tell me. Have you noticed any
strange phenomena around town?

10:14.864 --> 10:18.744
Uh, sulfur smells or power outages.
Maybe an unexplained fog?

10:19.035 --> 10:22.630
No, sir. It's always sunny
in Hope Springs.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.542
At least it used to be.

10:42.392 --> 10:43.894
Are you in a hurry or something?

10:44.227 --> 10:46.150
I'm on a bit of a deadline.

10:46.729 --> 10:51.075
Just give me some broad strokes.
First impressions. Come on. Hit me.

10:52.735 --> 10:55.238
It's good. Real good.

10:56.072 --> 10:58.325
Oh, man. You hate it.

10:59.951 --> 11:04.172
What? No, I love it. Love it.

11:04.581 --> 11:07.755
Last time I saw that look on an
editor's face, I'd just handed in Bugs.

11:08.751 --> 11:11.095
All right. Come on. Safe place.

11:15.300 --> 11:17.769
Details are what make a story great.

11:18.678 --> 11:21.272
This is lacking in some details.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.438
Like, all of them.

11:27.437 --> 11:30.862
"In the beginning, there was me."
Boom. Detail.

11:31.107 --> 11:33.986
And what a grabber.
I mean, I'm hooked. And I was there.

11:34.194 --> 11:37.664
I'm hooked, too. And yet, details.

11:39.782 --> 11:41.329
You weren't alone in the beginning.

11:42.952 --> 11:44.454
Your sister was with you.

11:49.209 --> 11:50.802
Who cares about her?

11:51.502 --> 11:52.503
Um...

11:54.088 --> 11:55.965
Me, for starters.

11:57.800 --> 12:01.304
I assume you're aware
that she's out and about.

12:02.180 --> 12:04.274
Tanned, rested and ready.

12:06.184 --> 12:08.107
I mean, that's why you're back, right?

12:10.271 --> 12:11.989
This isn't her story.

12:13.775 --> 12:14.776
It's mine.

12:27.538 --> 12:29.666
- Hey.
- I thought you were coming home early.

12:30.208 --> 12:31.881
I'm sorry. Paperwork.

12:34.003 --> 12:35.505
That follow you in from town?

12:40.176 --> 12:42.349
Honey, you wanna head inside
while I call this in?

12:43.179 --> 12:46.399
- It's just fog.
- Hey. You know I'm the law, right?

12:47.850 --> 12:50.820
See you inside, Deputy.
Don't forget your cuffs.

12:53.398 --> 12:56.197
Hey, Dispatch, this is 3-William-56,
you got your ears on?

12:56.359 --> 12:58.159
Aren't you done for the day,
Deputy?

12:58.194 --> 13:01.994
Lam. Listen, I know this might sound odd,
but there's a heavy fog headed my way.

13:02.198 --> 13:03.916
We expecting any weather like that?

13:04.158 --> 13:05.831
No, it's supposed to be

13:06.035 --> 13:07.537
clear skies all night.

13:12.208 --> 13:13.380
Anything you want to call in?

13:45.700 --> 13:46.952
That bad?

13:48.036 --> 13:50.255
I'll tell you.
There's some great bones in there.

13:51.581 --> 13:56.553
I'm thinking what's missing, maybe less
about detail and more about balance.

13:57.086 --> 13:58.087
How do you mean?

13:58.254 --> 14:00.757
You're giving the wrong stuff
too much real estate.

14:01.132 --> 14:02.930
Like that chapter about being Chuck.

14:04.218 --> 14:05.891
- What about it?
- Once you've explained

14:06.262 --> 14:10.392
the Vonnegut performance art,
that should be it.

14:10.933 --> 14:12.105
No one cares about the rest.

14:12.310 --> 14:17.111
I did some great stuff as Chuck.
I mean, I told you about my blog.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.450
- Uh, right, yeah.
- Right.

14:19.650 --> 14:23.280
- Your, uh, cat pic blog? Yeah.
- Yeah, they're super cute.

14:23.488 --> 14:26.742
So there's that.
And I traveled a lot, you know.

14:27.116 --> 14:31.246
- And I dated. Yeah? Had some girlfriends.
- Mmm.

14:31.579 --> 14:33.456
- Had a few boyfriends.
- Hmm.

14:33.623 --> 14:35.625
Oh, and I learned how to play guitar.

14:38.461 --> 14:41.260
Hmm.

14:42.632 --> 14:48.605
Yeah. That, you know, makes you seem
like a really grounded, likeable person.

14:50.181 --> 14:51.808
Yeah. What's wrong with that?

14:52.433 --> 14:55.528
You are neither grounded nor a person!

14:56.020 --> 14:57.220
So you're saying I'm likeable?

14:57.355 --> 15:01.485
No, no. lam saying that
Chapter "Chuckles" is devouring

15:01.984 --> 15:07.161
pounds of pages at the
expense of juicier stuff.

15:07.532 --> 15:10.285
Stuff that people might
actually wanna read.

15:11.327 --> 15:12.328
Like what?

15:13.162 --> 15:17.167
Well, like, uh... Like the archangels.

15:18.167 --> 15:22.297
But you've got, maybe,
two paragraphs on them in here.

15:23.172 --> 15:24.549
And that's it.

15:24.966 --> 15:28.687
Don't you think they deserve
a few extra words?

15:30.012 --> 15:32.014
Especially your favorite, Lucifer?

15:34.851 --> 15:35.852
He wasn't my favorite.

15:36.686 --> 15:37.687
Oh.

15:38.688 --> 15:40.190
He helped you defeat Amara.

15:40.648 --> 15:45.324
You trusted him with the Mark. And when
you asked him to bow to mankind...

15:45.528 --> 15:46.528
He refused.

15:46.696 --> 15:51.497
He rebelled! And in doing so,
kind of wrecked Christmas.

15:51.868 --> 15:54.712
Okay, all that's in there.
Except the bit about Christmas.

15:54.912 --> 15:58.883
If you say that Amara is off limits, fine.

15:59.500 --> 16:05.553
But you know every great hero
is defined by his or her villain.

16:05.882 --> 16:07.600
Lucifer is not a villain.

16:08.718 --> 16:10.061
He's...

16:11.846 --> 16:13.598
No, he wasn't a villain.

16:16.559 --> 16:18.778
Okay. Real talk.

16:20.229 --> 16:22.231
This is still a safe place, right?

16:23.733 --> 16:25.406
Safest place ever created.

16:27.361 --> 16:32.959
Okay. There are two types of memoir.

16:33.201 --> 16:36.421
One is honest, the other not so much.

16:37.079 --> 16:38.251
Truth and fairy tale.

16:38.748 --> 16:43.094
Now, do you wanna write
Life by Keith Richards,

16:44.212 --> 16:47.432
or do you wanna write
Wouldn't It Be Nice by Brian Wilson?

16:47.715 --> 16:48.887
I wanna tell the truth.

16:49.091 --> 16:50.434
Then you've got some work to do.

16:51.093 --> 16:53.937
There are no revelations in this book!

16:54.263 --> 16:56.607
And that's weird, given who you are.

16:57.266 --> 17:00.065
There's no new information.
No soul baring.

17:00.436 --> 17:02.109
That's because I don't have a soul.

17:02.730 --> 17:05.950
Right! But you invented them!

17:07.276 --> 17:10.119
You invented souls!

17:11.489 --> 17:12.832
Souls!

17:13.616 --> 17:16.790
Try shining a light on that.
How did that make you feel?

17:17.912 --> 17:19.414
Nauseous.

17:19.664 --> 17:22.166
You know what? No.

17:23.416 --> 17:27.968
That is not G-O-D talking.
That's Chuck talking.

17:28.756 --> 17:31.475
And I get it, when you were on Earth,
you had to go full method.

17:31.634 --> 17:33.978
Well, it's time for you to
get back into character.

17:34.929 --> 17:35.976
This is me.

17:36.138 --> 17:38.186
Really? This?

17:38.933 --> 17:45.316
This pile of self-doubt and
nebbishness flooded the Earth?

17:46.649 --> 17:50.279
Followed up Sodom with
a blockbuster Gomorrah?

17:51.320 --> 17:55.041
Created as much as he punished? No. Uh-uh.

17:56.325 --> 17:59.795
The guy I worked for? Total badass.

18:00.496 --> 18:02.169
And, yes, he could be a dick.

18:03.040 --> 18:06.510
Now, that guy had some stories to tell.

18:09.338 --> 18:11.011
And he has a lot to answer for.

18:15.720 --> 18:20.066
Okay. So...  What do I do?

18:20.891 --> 18:24.065
Hold up a mirror and show us who you are.

18:25.187 --> 18:28.987
Warts and all.
Write for an audience of one.

18:30.192 --> 18:31.193
You.

18:32.361 --> 18:34.864
- Dance like no one else is watching.
- Yeah.

18:36.365 --> 18:38.038
I'm gonna help you either way.

18:38.868 --> 18:40.495
But you gotta pick a lane.

18:44.206 --> 18:45.549
Richards or Wilson, Chuck.

18:59.764 --> 19:01.391
Richards. All the way.

19:18.741 --> 19:19.913
Sorry I woke you boys, but...

19:20.076 --> 19:22.750
No, no, it's all right. Just, uh...
Why don't you tell us what happened here.

19:23.037 --> 19:24.584
Harris didn't show up
for work this morning.

19:24.747 --> 19:27.591
We called, tried her CB, nothing.
So, I swung by here.

19:27.792 --> 19:31.888
I found Art on the kitchen floor.
Harris' shotgun right next to him.

19:32.088 --> 19:36.309
Sure looks like Deputy Harris
shot her husband

19:36.550 --> 19:39.429
point-blank in the face,
then left the scene.

19:39.595 --> 19:41.939
Did you notice anything off

19:42.098 --> 19:43.645
about Deputy Harris' behavior
last couple of days?

19:43.933 --> 19:45.810
No. Nothing at all.

19:46.102 --> 19:47.445
When was the last time
anyone heard from her?

19:47.603 --> 19:49.321
Called in for the last time yesterday,

19:49.897 --> 19:53.117
said something about
seeing some fog rolling in.

19:53.275 --> 19:55.653
I don't know why she cared
about the damn weather.

19:56.112 --> 19:57.830
Could you get in contact
with your dispatch officer?

19:58.072 --> 20:00.792
Tell her to let us know if she gets
any more reports like that again?

20:01.450 --> 20:02.930
- You serious?
- Yeah, just to be safe.

20:02.952 --> 20:04.952
And do you have any idea
where Harris might be now?

20:04.954 --> 20:08.800
No, but we can track her vehicle
from our office.

20:20.261 --> 20:23.686
Oh, this!
This is what I was talking about.

20:23.973 --> 20:28.149
Chapter 10, "Why I Never Answer Prayers
and You Should Be Glad I Don't."

20:28.936 --> 20:29.983
And Chapter 11,

20:30.271 --> 20:33.992
"The Truth About Divine Intervention
and Why I Avoid It At All Costs."

20:34.275 --> 20:36.494
- Better, right?
- It's gold!

20:37.153 --> 20:40.999
Kind of angry, with a side of bitter,
but hey. It's real.

20:42.032 --> 20:45.286
Now, not to overstep my bounds,

20:45.494 --> 20:48.668
but since you're on a roll, there's
one thing that I've always wondered.

20:49.290 --> 20:52.294
Maybe it'll make a good chapter,
maybe even a whole book.

20:52.501 --> 20:54.003
- Shoot.
- Why?

20:55.880 --> 20:57.052
Can you be more specific?

20:57.298 --> 21:00.347
I kind of get that question a lot
about pretty much everything.

21:01.177 --> 21:03.020
Why did you create life?

21:07.683 --> 21:08.809
I was lonely.

21:10.853 --> 21:12.571
Your sister wasn't company enough?

21:17.026 --> 21:20.656
I am being, she's nothingness.

21:22.156 --> 21:24.659
It's not exactly the makings
of a fun two-hander, you know?

21:24.867 --> 21:28.246
Yeah, but you didn't stop at one archangel

21:29.205 --> 21:32.755
or a handful of angels.
You created worlds.

21:33.209 --> 21:36.383
I was stupid. Naive.

21:38.088 --> 21:43.060
I thought if I could show my sister that
there was something more than just us,

21:43.344 --> 21:46.894
something better than us,
then maybe she'd change.

21:48.390 --> 21:51.769
Maybe she'd stop being her.

21:53.687 --> 21:54.904
But...

21:56.565 --> 22:01.241
Every time I'd build a new world,
she'd destroy it.

22:05.866 --> 22:09.461
So you and your archangels
locked her away.

22:10.955 --> 22:14.255
And you got down to unfettered creation.

22:17.378 --> 22:20.928
I tried to, anyway. But...

22:21.257 --> 22:24.602
This was as close as I got to
something as good as or better

22:24.802 --> 22:26.270
than me or my sister.

22:26.554 --> 22:28.272
The national park system?

22:28.931 --> 22:32.435
Nature. I mean,
look what nature created on its own.

22:33.727 --> 22:37.777
What's more, nature's smart enough to know
that sometimes, there's no fixing things.

22:38.566 --> 22:40.989
Sometimes, you just
have to wipe the slate clean.

22:41.610 --> 22:43.283
Wipe the slate clean.

22:44.488 --> 22:48.959
Sure. Natural selection. Good times.

22:49.952 --> 22:54.128
Of course, in your case that means flood
the Earth, but build and stock a boat.

22:55.124 --> 22:57.422
Start over fresh on the B-side.

22:58.085 --> 23:00.964
If Amara wipes the slate,
the slate's destroyed.

23:01.630 --> 23:06.807
Everything is destroyed.
All your great work, lost forever.

23:07.636 --> 23:09.479
We should take a stroll then.

23:10.139 --> 23:12.813
Enjoy it all one last time
before it's all gone.

23:23.777 --> 23:25.737
I can't make heads or tails.
Harris is...

23:26.780 --> 23:28.327
Was our computer person.

23:28.532 --> 23:29.624
Can I give it a shot?

23:31.869 --> 23:34.372
Sheriff. Matt and Emmy just called in.

23:34.622 --> 23:36.782
They said they saw some fog
rolling in by Jasper Hills.

23:38.208 --> 23:39.528
Did they say where it was headed?

23:39.710 --> 23:40.836
West. Towards town.

23:41.170 --> 23:42.513
Okay, call them back.
Tell 'em to get inside.

23:42.713 --> 23:44.135
Shut their windows and doors
and seal it up

23:44.340 --> 23:45.512
and stay the hell away from that fog.

23:45.674 --> 23:48.794
And get the word out to everybody in town.
They need to do the same damn thing.

23:48.844 --> 23:50.892
Hold on. What are you talking about?

23:51.513 --> 23:53.811
My partner and I have
seen this before, okay?

23:54.016 --> 23:55.814
Wes, Deputy Harris were infected

23:56.018 --> 23:58.218
by something in this fog.
Now, I know it sounds crazy...

23:58.312 --> 24:00.690
- No, it sounds like we should call CDC.
- There's no time for that.

24:00.856 --> 24:01.982
Found Deputy Harris.

24:04.193 --> 24:05.953
She's on Main Street.
Heading right this way.

24:06.195 --> 24:08.323
All right, we'll handle Harris.
Just, please get the word out.

24:08.530 --> 24:09.873
Tell everybody they need to stay inside,

24:10.074 --> 24:12.543
seal up their windows,
their doors, everything. Do it.

24:25.422 --> 24:26.890
Hey, get them out of here.

24:28.217 --> 24:31.437
Agent Greer, FBI. I need you to
get inside immediately. Go.

24:33.263 --> 24:38.110
I tried to kill myself.
But she won't let me.

24:39.561 --> 24:40.687
She has a message.

24:41.563 --> 24:43.565
For you, Dean Winchester.

24:44.566 --> 24:46.568
Amara. Is she here?

24:46.735 --> 24:50.239
No.
But her words have been echoing in my head

24:50.406 --> 24:52.249
ever since I took a breath of that fog.

24:52.700 --> 24:54.373
Did she tell you to kill your husband?

24:54.910 --> 24:57.288
And I watched myself do it.

24:58.872 --> 25:02.092
Okay, listen to me. This is an infection.
Put the gun down, let us help you.

25:02.292 --> 25:06.923
It's not an infection.
She says it's a mirror.

25:07.923 --> 25:09.766
She's showing us all the truth.

25:11.218 --> 25:14.097
- Darkness.
- The light was just a lie.

25:26.984 --> 25:29.112
It'll all be over soon.

25:30.279 --> 25:32.122
He's not gonna save them.

25:33.157 --> 25:36.752
It's all going away. Forever.

25:40.122 --> 25:41.624
But not you, Dean.

25:47.129 --> 25:49.678
Dean. Dean!

26:13.822 --> 26:17.167
Nature, divine. Human nature, toxic.

26:19.161 --> 26:20.879
They do like blowing stuff up.

26:21.538 --> 26:23.381
Yeah. And the worst part?

26:23.665 --> 26:27.135
They do it in my name. And then they come
crying to me. Asking me to forgive,

26:27.336 --> 26:28.633
to fix things.

26:29.004 --> 26:32.474
- Never taking any responsibility.
- What about your responsibility?

26:33.300 --> 26:35.723
I took responsibility. By leaving.

26:36.345 --> 26:38.518
At a certain point,
training wheels gotta come off.

26:38.847 --> 26:43.227
- No one likes a helicopter parent.
- What about Amara? She's your sister.

26:43.477 --> 26:46.196
I took responsibility for her, too.
Locked her away.

26:46.647 --> 26:50.402
Barely, I might add. And who let her out?

26:51.360 --> 26:54.204
Sam and Dean Winchester.
But they're trying to fix that.

26:54.363 --> 26:56.036
You know, I love those guys.

26:56.323 --> 26:58.997
But the world would still be spinning
with Demon Dean in it.

26:59.535 --> 27:01.295
But Sam couldn't have that,
though, could he?

27:01.745 --> 27:04.840
- And so how is Amara being out on me?
- It's not.

27:05.374 --> 27:07.877
- But you've helped the Winchesters before.
- Helped them?

27:08.377 --> 27:09.720
I've saved them.

27:10.337 --> 27:13.511
I've rebuilt Castiel more times than
I can remember. Look where that got me.

27:13.715 --> 27:15.217
So you're just gonna let Amara win?

27:15.717 --> 27:17.765
Eh. It's her time to shine.

27:18.053 --> 27:21.523
Then why the hell are we working
on your stupid memoir?

27:22.057 --> 27:24.025
You think it's stupid?

27:24.434 --> 27:29.235
No, I think it's stupid to write a book
nobody is gonna be around to read!

27:29.523 --> 27:31.400
You told me to write
for an audience of one.

27:32.109 --> 27:34.282
Me. And I

27:34.736 --> 27:36.079
think we're finally getting somewhere.

27:36.238 --> 27:39.412
You started writing the second
she came back, didn't you?

27:40.075 --> 27:42.248
No wonder you're on a deadline.

27:43.245 --> 27:47.421
Now I understand why you're masquerading
in that sad little meat suit.

27:48.375 --> 27:51.595
For the same reason
you created this nostalgic bar

27:51.879 --> 27:55.224
to write your masterpiece in!
You're hiding!

27:55.924 --> 27:59.098
Okay. First of all, this gift

27:59.761 --> 28:03.391
is super cute. Secondly, I'm not hiding.

28:03.932 --> 28:06.276
I just like the ambiance in here.

28:06.935 --> 28:10.610
You said, "The safest place ever created."

28:10.939 --> 28:15.319
Created by you to keep you
safe from Amara.

28:15.569 --> 28:18.823
- She can't touch you in here, can she?
- You're upset. I understand.

28:19.114 --> 28:20.957
And it's good to let it out.

28:21.158 --> 28:24.412
But, uh, let's focus on, uh,
finishing my book.

28:25.287 --> 28:29.633
You know, I was a crappy, terrible God.

28:31.126 --> 28:37.429
My work was pretty much a lame,
half-assed rewrite of your greatest hits.

28:39.259 --> 28:41.637
But at least I was never a coward!

29:08.997 --> 29:10.340
There he is.

29:11.500 --> 29:13.343
That's the guy I know.

29:14.002 --> 29:15.345
The guy I love.

29:16.505 --> 29:18.507
I remember the first time I saw you.

29:18.840 --> 29:21.184
All the angels were terrified,
but I wasn't.

29:22.177 --> 29:26.182
The feeling of your light was...
It was just beyond measure.

29:28.350 --> 29:30.853
And then, the unthinkable.

29:33.146 --> 29:36.525
You picked me to help you
with your tablets.

29:37.526 --> 29:40.700
You were just the closest angel
to the door when I walked in the room.

29:42.698 --> 29:45.326
There's nothing special
about you, Metatron.

29:46.243 --> 29:49.372
Not then. Not now.

29:52.374 --> 29:55.719
Now, I've been called many things.

29:57.045 --> 30:00.549
Absentee father. Wrathful monster.

30:02.342 --> 30:03.594
But coward?

30:06.555 --> 30:08.023
Lam not hiding.

30:09.099 --> 30:15.072
I am just done watching
my experiments' failures.

30:16.398 --> 30:18.901
You mean your failures, Chuck.

30:25.699 --> 30:27.201
You wanna watch? Be my guest.

30:27.451 --> 30:29.579
Reports are that there
wasn't a cloud in the sky,

30:29.745 --> 30:31.747
but as we know, a dense fog did roll in.

30:32.039 --> 30:35.919
Many citizens also feeling some sort of
impact from this fog.

30:38.253 --> 30:40.472
If you ask me, they're all reruns.

30:40.714 --> 30:41.931
Local law enforcement has been overwhelmed

30:42.090 --> 30:43.888
as the National Guard has been brought in.

30:45.427 --> 30:47.475
Hey, we gotta go. Here.

30:48.430 --> 30:50.728
Hey, sweetheart. Okay.
We're gonna get you out of here.

30:50.932 --> 30:52.605
We're gonna keep you safe, okay?

30:53.143 --> 30:56.317
- Okay, give me your hands. Oh! Okay.
- Thank you.

30:56.563 --> 30:57.985
Watch out. Okay.

30:58.315 --> 30:59.783
- Thank you.
- What the hell's going on?

30:59.983 --> 31:01.781
- You just get out of here, okay?
- What's this fog doing?

31:01.985 --> 31:03.828
Just get inside now. Go, go.

31:05.947 --> 31:07.790
- Guys, come on.
- Come in, Sam. Sam.

31:07.949 --> 31:09.075
We can't just let them go.

31:09.284 --> 31:10.627
They're right there.

31:23.465 --> 31:25.513
Agent Ehart. Radio's dead.

31:26.635 --> 31:27.978
You have any duct tape?

31:37.187 --> 31:39.189
Sam. Sam!

31:54.329 --> 31:55.797
You Okay?

32:09.636 --> 32:11.796
Sheriff, let's see if we can't
fix that radio of yours.

32:29.030 --> 32:30.031
Dean.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.047
You hear that?

33:06.568 --> 33:07.569
Dean.

33:30.759 --> 33:31.760
Sam!

33:39.059 --> 33:40.060
Sam.

33:40.602 --> 33:43.230
No, no. Get back. Don't.

33:43.438 --> 33:45.111
My God, he's infected.

33:48.068 --> 33:49.115
Everybody get inside!

33:51.154 --> 33:52.622
- Come on.
- Everybody.

33:52.948 --> 33:55.121
Come on.

33:55.575 --> 33:56.918
Come on, this way.

33:57.118 --> 33:59.086
Come on, come on.

33:59.287 --> 34:01.927
- Come on, let's go! Get in here!
- No, I'm not leaving my brother.

34:08.295 --> 34:10.639
You know, you really
are a terrific editor, Metatron.

34:13.301 --> 34:17.306
Well, I was a terrible writer. Worse God.

34:18.639 --> 34:20.483
It's good I got something going for me.

34:20.976 --> 34:24.606
Yeah, you know, I have to say, I didn't
see the whole evil turn thing coming.

34:24.813 --> 34:27.282
Why did you try to be me?

34:27.815 --> 34:31.661
That was just a sad,
pathetic cry for attention.

34:33.029 --> 34:34.656
Whose attention were you trying to get?

34:35.156 --> 34:36.328
Yours.

34:38.159 --> 34:41.504
You are light. Beauty.

34:42.289 --> 34:44.712
Creation. Wrath.

34:46.333 --> 34:48.632
Damnation and salvation.

34:49.379 --> 34:55.556
And I don't care if I was just
the angel nearest the door.

34:57.470 --> 34:59.393
You picked me.

35:01.182 --> 35:04.402
Your light shined on me.

35:04.853 --> 35:06.321
Me!

35:08.231 --> 35:10.359
Ah, the warmth...

35:11.526 --> 35:15.247
But then, you left me. You left all of us.

35:18.742 --> 35:21.871
It wasn't just the saps on Earth
who were praying to you.

35:22.203 --> 35:25.878
The angels prayed too.
And so did I. Every day.

35:26.541 --> 35:28.214
- I know.
- You wanna write

35:28.376 --> 35:32.847
the best-selling autobiography
of all time, you explain to me.

35:33.214 --> 35:37.264
Tell me why you abandoned me. Us.

35:37.886 --> 35:39.354
Because you disappointed me.

35:40.347 --> 35:44.693
- You all disappointed me.
- I know I'm a disappointment,

35:45.018 --> 35:47.066
but you're wrong about humanity.

35:47.354 --> 35:51.450
They are your greatest creation
because they're better than you are.

35:52.567 --> 35:59.576
Sure they're weak, and they cheat
and steal and destroy and disappoint.

36:00.617 --> 36:04.212
But they also give. And create.

36:04.746 --> 36:07.545
And they sing and dance and love.

36:09.542 --> 36:12.421
And above all, they never give up.

36:15.423 --> 36:17.096
But you do.

36:46.454 --> 36:47.455
Sam!

36:49.290 --> 36:51.463
Hey. Listen to me, Sam.

36:51.626 --> 36:53.628
- We're not gonna make it.
- No, no, no. There's no quitting here.

36:53.795 --> 36:55.513
We were never gonna make it.

36:55.797 --> 36:57.640
Sam, listen to me, that's not you talking,
it's the fog.

36:57.841 --> 37:01.846
You're gonna choose Amara.
Her over me. Over everything.

37:02.137 --> 37:03.980
- Sam, no!
- I’m sorry, I didn't mean that.

37:04.472 --> 37:07.817
I can't fight this. You gotta go.
You gotta go before you get infected.

37:08.393 --> 37:11.146
- Go before I hurt you!
- No, I'm not leaving you, ever!

37:34.169 --> 37:37.173
Stop this! You hear me, you dick?

37:46.848 --> 37:51.274
No, no, no!
Hey, look at me, I'm right here.

37:51.686 --> 37:57.034
I'm right here. Okay. It's okay.
It's all right. I'm here. I'm right here.

38:24.719 --> 38:26.562
Yeah!

38:29.390 --> 38:33.611
You know, I lied before.
I didn't really learn to play guitar.

38:34.479 --> 38:37.483
I just kind of gave myself the ability.

38:38.942 --> 38:40.910
I did the same
when I "learned" French.

38:41.903 --> 38:45.123
Man! This whole honesty thing
is really freeing.

38:47.116 --> 38:50.086
Come on. Take a look at the new pages.

38:51.246 --> 38:52.247
You know you want to.

38:53.331 --> 38:55.333
Think I'll pass.

38:55.750 --> 38:58.173
I think you're really gonna like them!

38:58.419 --> 39:00.968
You're right. It's a little high.

39:03.258 --> 39:05.602
All right. Suit yourself.

41:33.408 --> 41:35.581
- Okay?
- Thanks.

41:37.078 --> 41:38.250
Mom!

41:52.927 --> 41:54.600
We should probably talk.

42:27.962 --> 42:28.963
English - SDH
