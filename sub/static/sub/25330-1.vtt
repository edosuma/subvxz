Farid Morocco

02:14.100 --> 02:16.970
Carol, Jer, Steph, come on,
let's go!

02:18.505 --> 02:19.606
Where's your brother?

02:19.606 --> 02:21.474
It's not my day to keep him.
- Young lady?

02:21.474 --> 02:24.544
Sorry. He's upstairs shaving
the three whiskers off his face.

02:24.544 --> 02:26.246
Jer, let's go, man!

02:26.246 --> 02:28.648
Put that in the sink and come to
the living room.

02:28.648 --> 02:31.117
Let's go. Jer!

02:31.351 --> 02:33.453
Good morning.

02:35.555 --> 02:38.625
Oh, why don't you wear your gray
suit for the interview?

02:38.625 --> 02:39.959
Really?

02:39.959 --> 02:41.361
Yeah.

02:41.361 --> 02:42.562
Can we do
the picture first?

02:42.562 --> 02:44.030
Are you sure you
wanna do this right now?

02:44.030 --> 02:45.532
Yes, I wanna do it right now.

02:45.532 --> 02:46.733
And, we're gonna celebrate
tonight, okay?

02:46.733 --> 02:48.134
- What did you make it out of?

02:48.134 --> 02:49.369
Leftover drywall from the
garage.

02:49.369 --> 02:51.304
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:51.304 --> 02:54.140
- Jer, let's go, come on!
- Ow.

02:54.140 --> 02:56.609
- Sorry.
- I'm coming. Coming.

03:05.051 --> 03:06.619
Mom, does this look all right?

03:06.619 --> 03:09.789
- Oh, you look so handsome,
baby. Aww.
- It's so big.

03:09.789 --> 03:11.658
- Carol. Carol
- Yeah?

03:12.325 --> 03:13.927
Doesn't this thing
have a timer on it?

03:13.927 --> 03:15.828
Oh, I don't-- Yeah, ask
Stephanie. I don't know
about that.

03:15.828 --> 03:18.031
Here Dad, you do this.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.533
Okay, all right, cool.

03:21.234 --> 03:22.335
- Why are we doing
this right now?

03:22.335 --> 03:23.336
- Okay All right.

03:23.336 --> 03:26.105
We wanted to have
just a, you know,

03:26.105 --> 03:28.775
little ceremony of our own.

03:28.775 --> 03:31.477
We have a little somethin'
for ya.

03:32.145 --> 03:33.012
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:33.813 --> 03:35.081
Okay, close your eyes.

03:35.081 --> 03:36.749
Close 'em. Close 'em.

03:38.618 --> 03:40.353
- Keep 'em closed.
- [Tom] Keep 'em closed!

03:40.353 --> 03:42.021
- Okay.
- All right.

03:42.021 --> 03:43.856
And...

03:43.856 --> 03:45.625
Open your eyes!

03:46.292 --> 03:47.727
What?!

03:48.861 --> 03:50.363
Awesome.

03:50.363 --> 03:53.166
- Wait, you're doing one
of these for me too right?

03:53.166 --> 03:56.002
- Wow, I don't know what to say.

03:56.002 --> 03:58.204
- You just say the name of
the university you want

03:58.204 --> 04:01.641
and I will put it
right there in that blank!

04:04.077 --> 04:05.945
Whaddya' think? Any school.

04:06.145 --> 04:07.780
Say the school.

04:07.780 --> 04:09.315
Any school.

04:10.650 --> 04:13.219
- Well, I wanna go to
community college,

04:13.219 --> 04:15.822
and take the mechanics program.

04:15.822 --> 04:19.591
J-Jer, are you-
You're...

04:22.929 --> 04:27.533
We want you to start life on
the best possible footing.

04:29.836 --> 04:32.038
You need a four
year degree, son.

04:32.038 --> 04:33.573
Okay?

04:33.573 --> 04:35.642
- Okay. All right.

04:36.142 --> 04:37.677
Honey, what time is it?

04:37.677 --> 04:39.912
I'm gonna be late.
Here.

04:41.347 --> 04:43.483
Hit the timer. Go hit the
timer.
- Okay.

04:45.685 --> 04:47.620
I gotta change my suit.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.422
Oh, Dad, you're coming
to my race today, right?

04:49.422 --> 04:51.591
Yeah, I think I'll be able
to figure that out.

04:51.591 --> 04:52.992
Happy family.

04:52.992 --> 04:54.193
Oh, I gotta get my hat!

04:54.193 --> 04:55.895
- Oh, honey! Let me see.
- Nose bleed.

04:55.895 --> 04:58.064
- Oh, that's gonna hurt.
- Oh, oh, honey! Let me see. Let
me see.

04:58.064 --> 04:59.332
Get a tissue.

05:10.376 --> 05:12.178
Uh, Mr. Jenkins.

05:12.178 --> 05:13.880
- Whoa. Hey..
- Hey.

05:14.647 --> 05:16.316
I've heard some good things
about you, Trent.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.417
Uh, Tom. It's Tom.

05:17.417 --> 05:18.618
- Tom.
- Yeah.

05:18.618 --> 05:20.219
Uh, somebody pop you
in the nose, there, Tom?

05:20.219 --> 05:22.188
Oh, god, okay.

05:22.188 --> 05:24.290
Oh! I just bumped my-

05:24.290 --> 05:26.459
Yeah, Im just gonna carry on,
if you don't mind.

05:26.459 --> 05:30.730
You see, we are doing a little
strategic realignment

05:30.730 --> 05:33.132
here in the Southeast
which is exactly why I

05:33.132 --> 05:37.303
- As the new Southeastern
Regional Manager, I will do...

05:37.303 --> 05:40.640
- We got a little hiccup,
and we should talk about it.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.342
Did you know you have to have
a four year degree

05:42.342 --> 05:45.044
before you can manage here
at the corporate level?

05:45.044 --> 05:47.547
- Oh...
- [laughs] I mean I had no idea.

05:47.547 --> 05:48.748
I found that out
just the other day,

05:48.748 --> 05:51.751
and you don't have one.

05:51.751 --> 05:53.686
Anyway, you're a great worker,

05:53.686 --> 05:56.489
so I'm gonna send ya to Alabama
run our new store down there.

05:56.489 --> 05:58.558
And before you say yes

05:58.558 --> 06:01.761
I'm gonna kick in an extra
150 bucks a month.

06:01.761 --> 06:03.629
Pound it.
- Um.

06:05.698 --> 06:08.901
Okay...
- Okay! Which is awesome,

06:08.901 --> 06:10.536
because that means
I can make my tee time.

06:10.536 --> 06:13.106
And you are gonna go home
and tell the little lady

06:13.106 --> 06:14.440
about the good news.

06:14.440 --> 06:17.176
Oh, that made me queasy.
The little lady thing.

06:17.176 --> 06:19.345
Oh, God, I used to have a wife.

06:19.345 --> 06:21.214
Gots me a Porsche now.

06:21.681 --> 06:23.383
Ah. Could you do me a favor

06:23.383 --> 06:25.551
and haul my clubs down to
my car before you leave?

06:25.551 --> 06:26.853
Thank you, buddy.

06:27.887 --> 06:29.789
Brenda, hold all my calls!

06:55.615 --> 06:58.684
Jeremy. Hey, sugar. Good
luck, honey.

07:00.486 --> 07:01.888
- What?
- Where's Dad?

07:01.888 --> 07:03.523
Um, he had to stay late.

07:03.523 --> 07:05.558
It's okay. Have fun.

07:07.960 --> 07:10.129
I'm gonna crush you,
Mama's boy.

07:10.129 --> 07:12.565
- Yeah fat chance of that.

07:13.299 --> 07:16.436
- All right, you've done a good
job in the shop this semester.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.038
I had a hard time getting
approval for this.

07:19.038 --> 07:22.575
Don't turn it into a race.
Just get out there and finish.

07:22.575 --> 07:24.110
You're first up.

07:25.912 --> 07:28.014
Glad to be rid of
you knuckleheads.

07:29.348 --> 07:31.884
Nice helmet. Loser.

07:33.319 --> 07:34.887
Try to keep up.

07:38.257 --> 07:41.394
On your mark. Get set!

07:52.572 --> 07:54.173
Go, go, go!

08:03.015 --> 08:05.084
Go, go, go, go!

08:07.353 --> 08:08.621
- What do I do? Just brake
right now?
- Just brake!

08:10.156 --> 08:11.424
Ah!

08:12.892 --> 08:15.761
Come on, Jeremy! Go, baby!

08:16.863 --> 08:18.598
Look out!

08:35.481 --> 08:37.917
Move! Move! Go on,
get out of the way!

08:54.433 --> 08:56.903
I've gotta work on my résumé.

09:03.876 --> 09:06.312
The new engine
I built worked great.

09:06.312 --> 09:07.680
Guess who pulls in front
right at the last minute.

09:07.680 --> 09:09.882
- Who?
- This guy, right here.

09:14.921 --> 09:16.122
Honey?

09:17.156 --> 09:19.692
You okay? Ah-ah-ah.

09:19.692 --> 09:21.561
I am great.

09:23.629 --> 09:24.964
Why didn't you go to the race?

09:25.364 --> 09:27.099
You knew about it for,
like, two weeks.

09:29.702 --> 09:30.903
Okay.

09:31.337 --> 09:32.471
All right.

09:32.471 --> 09:33.973
You want the bad news,

09:33.973 --> 09:35.708
the bad news, or the
good news first?

09:36.242 --> 09:38.644
Um, good news?

09:38.644 --> 09:40.713
Okay, we're at least
$80,000 richer.

09:41.681 --> 09:43.149
That's great! Can I get a car?

09:43.149 --> 09:44.517
Oh, my gosh.

09:44.517 --> 09:46.252
Okay, the bad news?

09:46.252 --> 09:51.757
Q-Mark is moving us to
Alabama, end of next week!

09:51.757 --> 09:52.925
What?

09:52.925 --> 09:55.294
I'm not leaving a
week before graduation.

09:55.294 --> 09:58.698
Well, Jeremy, you let
this be lesson to you.

09:58.698 --> 10:03.469
I didn't get the job because
I don't have a four year degree.

10:03.469 --> 10:05.404
So, I don't have a choice.

10:05.404 --> 10:07.206
We don't have a choice.

10:07.206 --> 10:08.474
We should be talking
about this without the kids-

10:08.474 --> 10:11.944
Wait. Didn't you say there
were two pieces of bad news?

10:13.112 --> 10:14.880
It's actually part of
the good news.

10:15.314 --> 10:16.582
My dad died.

10:18.217 --> 10:20.152
I thought he was dead already.

10:21.887 --> 10:22.755
What?

10:24.924 --> 10:27.693
Sweetie, I'm so sorry.

10:27.693 --> 10:29.695
It's the only decent thing
the man ever did.

10:30.429 --> 10:34.200
But, at least we can sell the
property and be done with it.

10:34.200 --> 10:35.635
What property?

10:35.635 --> 10:37.003
It's over there.

10:37.603 --> 10:38.838
That is just like him.

10:38.838 --> 10:40.373
Just like him.

10:40.373 --> 10:41.841
He dies and I get
a letter in the mail

10:41.841 --> 10:44.577
with a picture of a
service station.

10:44.577 --> 10:48.214
Dad, that's awesome! We can,
like, work on a car together.

10:48.214 --> 10:49.915
As nice at that sounds, Jeremy,

10:49.915 --> 10:51.450
that's the least of my
worries right now.

10:51.450 --> 10:53.386
Jeremy, um...

10:55.755 --> 10:58.858
- Come on, Stephy.
- It was just getting good.

11:04.597 --> 11:05.965
Honey.

11:05.965 --> 11:07.867
I don't know what to say.

11:08.801 --> 11:10.403
I know this sounds crazy,

11:10.403 --> 11:14.607
but... we always wanted
to have our own business.

11:17.543 --> 11:19.745
Seriously, Carol?

11:19.745 --> 11:21.480
Don't even start that right now.

11:21.480 --> 11:24.617
We could sell this house
right now for $110,000

11:24.617 --> 11:27.453
in the low point of this market,
quick sale.

11:27.453 --> 11:29.555
We only owe $30,000.

11:29.555 --> 11:32.825
We can match this
Conrad fella for his 80.

11:32.825 --> 11:35.261
We would have our own new house,

11:35.261 --> 11:37.063
a service station,

11:37.063 --> 11:38.564
free and clear.

11:39.765 --> 11:41.400
We've turned into four people

11:41.400 --> 11:44.737
in the same house looking
out different windows.

11:47.006 --> 11:48.274
I don't know why, but I just-

11:48.274 --> 11:51.343
I can feel that this is
really right.

11:56.582 --> 11:59.118
And you and I can reconnect.

12:00.886 --> 12:02.221
I'll do the books.

12:02.221 --> 12:04.290
It'll be our family business.

12:06.192 --> 12:09.628
Look, the bottom line is
I just don't trust him.

12:09.628 --> 12:13.499
He's gonna lure us in just
enough to sucker punch us.

12:13.499 --> 12:15.701
Sweetie...

12:15.701 --> 12:17.503
Oh, I love you.

12:18.871 --> 12:21.640
Will you just think about it?

12:21.640 --> 12:23.676
Okay, I'm gonna leave you alone.

12:24.677 --> 12:26.645
Just think about it.

12:39.058 --> 12:41.560
“I'm sorry, Tom, you have to
have a four-year degree.”

12:42.128 --> 12:43.729
Management Training, doesn't
mean anything.

12:45.898 --> 12:48.400
Manager of the Year, even less.

12:48.734 --> 12:52.605
Employee of the month, nothing.

12:54.640 --> 12:56.408
“Company perks!”

13:02.848 --> 13:04.016
She's right.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.186
Screw this.

13:08.187 --> 13:10.856
Mr. Jenkins.

13:14.693 --> 13:18.297
Mr. Jenkins!
- Oh! Oh, whoa. Yes, yes?

13:18.297 --> 13:20.299
I have been with this company
for 20 years.

13:20.299 --> 13:21.901
I have jumped through every hoop
that this company

13:21.901 --> 13:23.002
has wanted me to jump through.

13:23.002 --> 13:25.604
I am the best manager
that you have.

13:25.604 --> 13:27.907
I want the Southeastern Regional
Manager position.

13:27.907 --> 13:29.408
I'm not moving my family.

13:29.408 --> 13:31.911
Trevor, what are you
talking about?

13:31.911 --> 13:33.112
It's all been put into motion.

13:33.112 --> 13:34.747
My name is Tom.

13:34.747 --> 13:36.115
Look, what difference
does it make?

13:36.115 --> 13:37.750
The decision's been made.

13:40.019 --> 13:43.455
Okay. Well, then, I quit.

13:45.357 --> 13:46.792
Okay.

13:49.161 --> 13:51.197
I am serious about that.

13:51.197 --> 13:52.598
Me, too.

13:52.898 --> 13:54.900
The good news is, we don't have
to pay your pension.

13:55.701 --> 13:58.971
Oh, and would you drop off your
badge with Judy on your way out,
please?

14:00.005 --> 14:04.443
Brenda, could you get me Alex
over at store 324?

14:04.443 --> 14:06.312
Is that right? 324.

14:06.512 --> 14:07.947
You're a sweetheart.

14:09.448 --> 14:10.816
Anything else?

14:30.169 --> 14:31.871
Oh, Jeremy,

14:31.871 --> 14:34.907
you have a whole drawer full of
clothes here.

14:38.277 --> 14:39.578
Jeremy!

14:42.648 --> 14:45.117
You didn't mail in
your college applications?

14:45.117 --> 14:47.186
- Look, Mom, I-
- Are these boxes ready?

14:47.953 --> 14:49.955
Uh, yeah, you can take
those two.

14:49.955 --> 14:54.593
All right. All right. Lift with
your legs, not with your back.

14:58.697 --> 14:59.698
What're you all doing?

14:59.698 --> 15:01.533
I'm just helping him
finish packing.

15:01.533 --> 15:03.469
Okay, well come on. We gotta go.

15:03.469 --> 15:05.437
Let's go! Come on.

15:07.539 --> 15:09.141
Thanks, Mom.

15:10.009 --> 15:13.379
Do you have any idea how crushed
he's going to be

15:13.379 --> 15:14.880
when he finds this?

15:16.916 --> 15:19.318
You are so lucky
we are moving today.

15:19.318 --> 15:20.819
Finish packing.

15:41.106 --> 15:43.742
Oh, look at that. That's that
Bainesville guy

15:43.742 --> 15:45.644
who offered you the buyout.

15:45.644 --> 15:47.780
He's got his own billboard?

15:53.819 --> 15:55.020
Wow.

15:55.020 --> 15:56.989
She's got a good foundation.

15:58.123 --> 15:59.658
She'll clean up all right.

16:00.125 --> 16:01.393
Uh huh.

16:18.677 --> 16:21.780
All right, people, let's
adjust our attitudes.

16:21.780 --> 16:22.848
It's just a little dirt.

16:25.050 --> 16:27.686
I guess we just need to
start chucking stuff, I guess.

16:27.686 --> 16:29.254
 Yeah, definitely all--

16:29.254 --> 16:31.090
Not that! I love that.

16:31.390 --> 16:33.158
- Really?
- Yeah, your daddy has
good taste.

16:33.158 --> 16:34.093
That's a antique.

16:37.629 --> 16:38.931
Okay, whatever.

16:43.969 --> 16:45.037
Dad!

16:46.005 --> 16:47.206
Dad!

16:50.109 --> 16:52.077
- Wow.
- Right?

16:52.378 --> 16:54.580
That is a piece of junk now.

16:54.580 --> 16:55.814
I'm gonna have to
get a tow truck.

16:55.814 --> 16:58.217
Wait now, Dad, come on, let me
have it.

16:58.217 --> 17:00.285
Let me have it, please!

17:02.287 --> 17:03.288
Please?

17:03.288 --> 17:06.392
Okay. All right,

17:06.392 --> 17:08.127
all right, if...
- Okay

17:08.127 --> 17:10.829
- ...you can get that running
- Well, I'll get it running.

17:10.829 --> 17:12.231
That's no problem.

17:12.231 --> 17:13.432
Then it's yours.

17:13.432 --> 17:17.002
What? Yes! Thank you so much!

17:18.002 --> 17:19.304
Oh!

17:20.005 --> 17:21.740
Hey-hey, hey-hey.

17:23.075 --> 17:27.012
Time to send those in,
or tell your dad. Your choice.

17:27.012 --> 17:28.614
Man up, son.

17:29.281 --> 17:32.284
Woo. I am dog-tired.

17:32.651 --> 17:34.420
Feels good though, right?

17:35.821 --> 17:37.456
Ha!

17:38.557 --> 17:40.692
This place is disgusting.

17:42.694 --> 17:45.697
God, I just-I wanted to
give you so much more by now.

17:45.697 --> 17:49.134
I mean you're right,
look at this place. It's a dump.

17:49.968 --> 17:51.703
What?

17:51.703 --> 17:54.673
Tom Williamson, I love you.

17:54.673 --> 17:56.942
I'm so glad we
get to start over.

17:56.942 --> 17:58.777
And your daddy gave us that.

18:02.548 --> 18:04.550
Why you always gotta be
so positive? Huh?

18:04.550 --> 18:05.751
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

18:05.751 --> 18:06.885
No...

18:16.728 --> 18:18.230
I wish I had your faith.

18:18.997 --> 18:21.967
All the faith you need is
just the size of a seed.

18:29.708 --> 18:31.677
Wow. I love it.

18:31.677 --> 18:33.278
Me, too.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.682
I think I just threw up
a little bit.

18:38.283 --> 18:39.651
Oh. That's gross.

18:39.651 --> 18:41.086
- Just needs a little elbow
grease.

18:41.086 --> 18:42.154
- Yeah, we could pick up
al that stuff.

18:42.154 --> 18:43.956
And a feather duster, maybe.

18:45.090 --> 18:46.592
Who's this?

18:46.592 --> 18:48.127
Oh, I think that's J.P.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.229
- J.P.?
- Yeah, he's supposed to
meet us here.

18:50.229 --> 18:51.763
That's the guy?

18:52.564 --> 18:54.700
- J. P. Clark.
- Hey, J.P., I'm Tom.

18:54.700 --> 18:55.834
Nice to meet you.

18:57.569 --> 19:00.105
Uh, who is that?

19:01.740 --> 19:04.443
That's Hank. Sweetheart
of a guy.

19:04.443 --> 19:06.078
He kinda comes
with the place.

19:06.078 --> 19:07.579
- Okay.

19:07.579 --> 19:09.581
Well, what d'ya think?

19:10.949 --> 19:12.918
- Excited.
- It's great. Yeah.

19:14.186 --> 19:17.723
Mr. Baines will go up to
95,000, if you wanna reconsider.

19:19.825 --> 19:23.562
- Well, maybe.
- No. No, we want we want it.

19:23.562 --> 19:25.264
- All right.
- We want it.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.266
Well, thank you.

19:29.535 --> 19:31.470
- Appreciate it.
- Welcome to Bainesville.

19:35.741 --> 19:37.676
Hey. Hey, there, Hank.

19:37.676 --> 19:41.246
J.P. told us your name. I'm Tom.

19:46.752 --> 19:48.220
Is he okay?

19:48.220 --> 19:49.555
I think so.

19:50.822 --> 19:53.158
His chest is going up and down.

19:56.962 --> 19:58.697
Whoa, hey!

19:59.264 --> 20:01.700
Thought we lost ya there
for a second, buddy.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.602
I'm Tom.

20:03.602 --> 20:05.270
You just hangin' out?

20:05.270 --> 20:06.872
I'm Carol.

20:07.439 --> 20:09.107
I'm-I'm Carol!

20:09.107 --> 20:10.842
[Tom, shouting] We're the
new owners!

20:10.842 --> 20:12.844
I'm not deaf!

20:12.844 --> 20:15.047
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.582
Well, everything's unlocked.

20:16.582 --> 20:18.183
Mom, you gotta check this out.

20:18.917 --> 20:22.454
That's great to know.

20:52.150 --> 20:53.352
Wow.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.535
God.

21:25.284 --> 21:28.053
We have got our
work cut out for us.

21:31.123 --> 21:34.359
Jeremy. What're you doing?

21:34.359 --> 21:35.994
Dad, this is you?

21:37.729 --> 21:39.197
You used to race?

21:39.965 --> 21:42.801
Wow. Look at that.

21:43.869 --> 21:45.170
Yeah.

21:46.071 --> 21:47.272
It's a matter of opinion,
though.

21:47.272 --> 21:49.841
Clem always said
I was no good, but--

21:49.841 --> 21:51.109
You were young.

21:51.843 --> 21:53.312
I won all those.

21:58.016 --> 21:59.151
Wow.

21:59.918 --> 22:01.687
This is awesome.

22:05.123 --> 22:07.326
Golly.

22:08.226 --> 22:13.598
I am... I'm surprised
he kept all this crap.

22:14.399 --> 22:16.268
So, why didn't you and
your dad talk?

22:17.736 --> 22:19.805
Dad?

22:19.805 --> 22:23.508
Let's just say he made a very
conscious choice

22:23.508 --> 22:25.811
to leave all that behind
and so did I.

22:31.049 --> 22:33.685
So, what're we gonna
call this place?

22:37.956 --> 22:39.658
We gotta get it
cleaned up first.

22:39.658 --> 22:42.794
So let's...Head out front and
I'll be out there in a minute

22:42.961 --> 22:44.329
All right.

22:45.697 --> 22:48.533
Figure out the game plan.

23:18.964 --> 23:21.066
Ew.

23:21.600 --> 23:22.734
Uck.

23:33.745 --> 23:35.013
Sorry, Hank.

23:38.383 --> 23:39.684
Sorry.

24:00.639 --> 24:02.574
Whoa! Whoa!

24:02.574 --> 24:05.710
Oh, oh no, no, no, no, no!

24:05.710 --> 24:07.112
Dad!

24:08.013 --> 24:09.047
Dad!

24:09.581 --> 24:11.416
- Go, go, get the tires!
- Dad!

24:11.416 --> 24:13.051
Oh, god!

24:13.585 --> 24:14.853
Dad!

24:23.628 --> 24:26.198
- Wait-wait, wait-wait!
- Oh, god.

24:31.803 --> 24:33.104
Come on.

24:35.974 --> 24:38.410
All right. Woo.

24:55.827 --> 24:57.662
- Well, that looks good
and cold.

24:58.663 --> 25:00.232
- Coldest in the county.

25:00.899 --> 25:02.100
- Where'd you get it?

25:03.668 --> 25:04.970
- From your machine.

25:04.970 --> 25:06.371
- We have a drink machine?

25:06.805 --> 25:07.906
- Where?

25:09.908 --> 25:11.576
- Around the corner.

25:11.576 --> 25:13.144
- Oh, thanks.

25:13.645 --> 25:14.946
- Bees.

25:16.014 --> 25:17.582
Careful, son.

25:18.116 --> 25:19.885
- Don't you worry your pretty
'lil head there, Hank.

25:19.885 --> 25:21.520
I'll bees all right.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.297
Well, look at that.

25:34.199 --> 25:36.768
Wow. That is a good deal.

25:44.743 --> 25:46.278
Bees!

25:46.545 --> 25:48.380
Aah!

26:09.034 --> 26:10.502
Thanks, Hank.

26:10.502 --> 26:14.706
We're not gonna let a little
bees and a little rain
get us down.

26:14.706 --> 26:16.541
We're doing this.
- I think there's some over
here, too.

26:16.541 --> 26:18.109
Let me see.
- Yeah.

26:18.944 --> 26:21.046
Oh, look at that. Our
first customer.

26:21.046 --> 26:22.247
What?

26:25.917 --> 26:27.719
- Here.
- Well, set it down.

26:29.120 --> 26:30.855
You nut.

26:30.855 --> 26:35.627
I am just gonna go
handle a little business.

26:35.927 --> 26:38.863
As you can see, you're gonna
have plenty of room for parking.

26:40.565 --> 26:42.267
Real nice.

26:42.267 --> 26:44.803
Ever hear of Chick Chickabee,
the North Carolina Whistler?

26:44.803 --> 26:47.672
He was born in that house
right over there.

26:48.506 --> 26:50.408
I thought you said this station
was non-operational.

26:50.408 --> 26:52.978
Oh, it wasn't. Well, I'll take
care of this.

26:56.114 --> 26:57.716
- Jenkins?
- Ted?

26:57.716 --> 27:00.185
- Tom.
- Tom.

27:00.185 --> 27:02.554
- You guys know each other?
- Not really.

27:03.188 --> 27:04.990
You could say that.

27:07.492 --> 27:09.561
That was kind of a waste of
money, don't you think?

27:09.561 --> 27:11.596
- Excuse me?
- Oh, what you're doing here.

27:11.596 --> 27:13.765
We're just gonna
tear it down anyway.

27:13.765 --> 27:15.934
What're you trying to do,
extort me for more money?

27:15.934 --> 27:17.502
Come on.

27:19.704 --> 27:22.807
Okay, Mr. Jenkins, do you care
to explain what's going on,
please.

27:22.807 --> 27:26.177
This is a primary site
for a brand new Q-Mark.

27:26.177 --> 27:29.247
- Uh, no.
- Excuse me?

27:29.247 --> 27:31.383
Okay, we turned down
your piddly little offer.

27:31.383 --> 27:32.517
This is my station,
free and clear

27:32.517 --> 27:33.985
and I have no intentions
of selling it.

27:33.985 --> 27:36.988
- Okay, just settle down, Turbo.
- Okay, my name is Tom!

27:39.524 --> 27:43.328
I am not putting a Q-Mark on
this land.

27:43.328 --> 27:47.632
Think you might just take this
conversation elsewhere, son.

27:47.632 --> 27:49.668
What're you doing here?

27:50.068 --> 27:51.870
Cold Cheerwine.

27:53.371 --> 27:55.473
 Okay, look, this
conversation's over.

27:55.473 --> 27:57.542
All right, please leave.

27:58.343 --> 27:59.878
Let's go, Conrad.

28:00.979 --> 28:03.281
You told me you
had this sorted out.

28:03.281 --> 28:05.083
I'll take care of this.

28:05.483 --> 28:06.951
We'll be back later.

28:25.503 --> 28:28.106
- I'm really starting to like
this whole be-your-own-boss
thing.

28:28.106 --> 28:29.374
That was awesome.

28:29.374 --> 28:31.009
Mwah, mwah, mwah.
I love you, honey.

28:31.009 --> 28:33.978
Tonight, we celebrate.

28:36.448 --> 28:39.084
Yeah, that's a small town,
for ya.

28:39.084 --> 28:41.619
Looks like the only place open.

28:52.430 --> 28:54.499
Dad, this is great.

28:54.499 --> 28:56.334
- Howdy.
- Hey.

28:59.637 --> 29:01.406
These old pictures.

29:01.406 --> 29:03.608
What's it say? Roy “Fig Newton”,

29:03.608 --> 29:05.877
“Monkey-Wrench” Tucker,

29:05.877 --> 29:08.046
“Red Dirt” Randy,

29:08.046 --> 29:10.148
“Lug Nut” Williamson.

29:10.148 --> 29:13.251
Oh, look. Look.
That's Clem, right?

29:13.251 --> 29:15.353
God, look at that. It sure is.

29:16.654 --> 29:19.124
Looks like he was
a pretty decent driver.

29:19.124 --> 29:22.060
Ol' Lug Nut was one of the best
drivers ever around these parts.

29:22.060 --> 29:24.429
And that, that's that
Baines jerk, right?

29:24.929 --> 29:26.765
Yeah, we used to think
ol' Gold-Digger there

29:26.765 --> 29:28.333
paid people off to let him win,

29:28.333 --> 29:30.502
but we never could
prove it, though.

29:30.502 --> 29:33.438
Anyway, I'm Dirty Harry Hawkins.
People call me D.H.

29:33.438 --> 29:35.073
Hey D.H., I'm Tom.

29:35.073 --> 29:37.142
Are you Clem's boy?

29:37.509 --> 29:40.912
Yeah, Clem would be my father,
yeah.

29:40.912 --> 29:43.715
Well I'll be ding-danged and
dipped in snuff.

29:43.715 --> 29:45.483
He found you!

29:45.483 --> 29:49.053
Oh, wait a minute. You must
be the ones fixing up
Lug Nutz shop.

29:49.053 --> 29:51.489
Yeah, we're here to celebrate
the grand opening.

29:51.489 --> 29:52.791
Well let's celebrate.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.325
Follow me, I'll get ya
a good table.

29:54.325 --> 29:55.593
Come on.

29:57.195 --> 29:59.798
At least his name carries
a little weight around here.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.032
Yeah.

30:03.535 --> 30:04.769
You wanted to see me,
Mr. Baines?

30:04.769 --> 30:07.372
Yeah. Did you
make my offer?

30:07.372 --> 30:08.940
Yes sir, I asked them.

30:09.407 --> 30:11.075
They didn't want to take it.

30:11.075 --> 30:12.443
You asked them?

30:12.710 --> 30:16.714
Did you ask them politely? Did
you ask them gingerly?

30:16.714 --> 30:19.684
Did ya put a frickin'
cherry on the top?

30:19.684 --> 30:21.986
You don't ask 'em, you tell 'em!

30:21.986 --> 30:24.756
I'm trying to do economic
development around here!

30:24.756 --> 30:26.591
Isn't that what you want?

30:26.591 --> 30:28.092
Huh?
- Yes sir, I do.

30:28.092 --> 30:30.028
Then start acting like it.

30:30.028 --> 30:31.963
I shouldn't have to be
doing everything.

30:33.198 --> 30:34.899
What about the
Betty Tucker Estate?

30:34.899 --> 30:36.634
Mrs. Tucker didn't have a will.

30:37.335 --> 30:40.171
All her assets will be
dealt with at auction.

30:40.805 --> 30:42.240
Now, look on the bright side.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.609
You'll probably be
the only one there anyway.

30:45.777 --> 30:47.178
Get outta here.

30:53.418 --> 30:55.653
I met Clem at a race.

30:55.653 --> 30:58.957
I was kinda in the midst
of reinventing myself.

30:58.957 --> 31:00.758
I'd just graduated with
a Masters Degree

31:00.758 --> 31:02.327
in Mechanical Engineering.

31:03.795 --> 31:05.763
What, I don't look the type?

31:07.065 --> 31:10.869
I had a lot of book smarts,
but it was your daddy...

31:10.869 --> 31:13.404
...who taught me the practical
application of everything...

31:13.404 --> 31:15.607
...stuff I never would've
learned in a class.

31:16.441 --> 31:18.009
- Like what?
- Cars...

31:18.009 --> 31:19.611
...everything about 'em,
from the ground up.

31:19.611 --> 31:21.412
He knew how to drive 'em,
build 'em,

31:21.412 --> 31:23.815
he knew everything
about cars and racing.

31:23.815 --> 31:24.949
Yeah.

31:24.949 --> 31:26.351
That's interesting.

31:26.351 --> 31:27.819
How long ago was that?

31:28.052 --> 31:30.255
Oh, it was a little
over 20 years ago,

31:30.255 --> 31:33.424
right around the same time
you two were married.

31:34.259 --> 31:35.760
What, he talked about that?

31:35.760 --> 31:38.363
Oh, yeah. He was real happy
about it.

31:39.764 --> 31:40.999
Now that's funny,

31:40.999 --> 31:45.870
because he gave me a lug nut
for a wedding gift.

31:45.870 --> 31:47.171
Keep the wheels on your love...

31:47.171 --> 31:49.073
...like the man knew
anything about that.

31:49.073 --> 31:50.808
Um, what's a lug nut?

31:51.175 --> 31:53.378
Well, without lug nuts
the tires fall off.

31:53.378 --> 31:55.213
A lug nut's a small thing,

31:55.213 --> 31:57.548
but it holds the whole thing
together.

31:57.548 --> 31:59.117
Can't do anything without 'em.

31:59.117 --> 32:01.352
Must've meant something to ya,

32:01.352 --> 32:03.655
kept it on a key
chain for 20 years.

32:07.091 --> 32:11.496
Ol' Clem, he leased that shop
from Conrad's daddy.

32:12.697 --> 32:16.234
Clem and Conrad, they never
did get along very well.

32:16.234 --> 32:19.370
So when Conrad's
daddy retired...

32:19.370 --> 32:21.039
...Conrad took over his affairs,

32:21.039 --> 32:23.241
and he come after
the shop first thing.

32:23.241 --> 32:26.110
Now, Clem bet him a race on it.

32:26.110 --> 32:27.912
They raced for it?

32:28.546 --> 32:30.915
It was 50 laps,
winner takes all.

32:30.915 --> 32:32.750
And they went at it
hammer and tong,

32:32.750 --> 32:35.386
nose to nose, for 49 laps.

32:35.386 --> 32:38.022
Come down to that last
straightaway, bang,

32:38.022 --> 32:40.591
your grandpa won
that station, bang.

32:40.591 --> 32:41.659
What? That's awesome.

32:41.659 --> 32:44.128
You know, Conrad
still wants that shop.

32:44.128 --> 32:46.264
He offered us 95,000 for it.

32:46.264 --> 32:48.032
95,000? That's an insult.

32:48.032 --> 32:49.667
The land alone's worth that.

32:49.667 --> 32:51.803
He wants to put
a Quality-Mark there.

32:51.803 --> 32:53.771
Q-Mark here.

32:53.771 --> 32:56.074
We had one of those here,
that'd pretty much finish off

32:56.074 --> 32:57.675
all the little guys in this town

32:57.675 --> 33:00.578
and a lot of people are
barely hanging on as it is.

33:00.578 --> 33:03.214
Hey, you know what?
We need some mechanics.

33:03.214 --> 33:05.350
Can you refer us to anybody?

33:05.350 --> 33:06.951
I tell you what I'll do.

33:06.951 --> 33:09.754
Tomorrow I'll send you
Charlie and Derwin.

33:09.754 --> 33:14.492
They both been downsized by
one of Conrad's
development deals,

33:14.492 --> 33:17.595
and they happen to be two
of the best mechanics
in the county.

33:17.595 --> 33:20.298
Well, that would be fantastic
'cause we need the help.

33:20.298 --> 33:21.666
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

33:21.666 --> 33:23.134
It's a pleasure.

33:28.373 --> 33:31.109
I like this one with the light.
- Oh, thanks.

33:36.414 --> 33:37.982
What is this?

33:37.982 --> 33:40.018
I was trying to encourage
Stephy's creativity.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.452
Look at her framing.

33:41.452 --> 33:43.287
It's a doorknob.

33:43.287 --> 33:45.590
Honey, look, can we
encourage our bank account?

33:45.590 --> 33:46.791
It gets expensive.

33:46.791 --> 33:48.426
- Dad!
- What?

33:48.426 --> 33:49.293
What?

33:49.293 --> 33:50.728
Somebody had too much coffee.

33:50.728 --> 33:52.397
Well, I'm just saying-
they're great, honey.

33:52.397 --> 33:53.698
Just keep 'em on the computer.

33:53.698 --> 33:55.733
It's not the same as prints.

33:56.901 --> 33:59.103
You're lucky the Cheerwine guy's
here, buddy.

33:59.103 --> 34:02.106
The Cheer-- Bees!
Wait-wait! Don't touch--

34:04.409 --> 34:06.077
Tricky little boogers,
aren't they?

34:09.880 --> 34:11.916
You make normal deliveries here?

34:11.916 --> 34:14.085
Yeah. Why do you think
I got this hood on?

34:15.119 --> 34:15.953
Um...

34:15.953 --> 34:17.655
Oh, here you go.

34:17.655 --> 34:19.290
Gotta run, on a schedule.

34:19.290 --> 34:21.559
Hey, can we get another machine?

34:21.559 --> 34:23.694
- You can't move that one.
- Well, why not?

34:23.694 --> 34:25.196
It's full of bees.

34:57.995 --> 34:59.864
Jeremy, the big tires
go on the bottom.

34:59.864 --> 35:01.532
- Dad.
- You gotta make the pyramid.

35:03.267 --> 35:05.536
Oh, hey, can I help you?

35:05.536 --> 35:08.005
Yeah, I'm Charlie. D.H. sent me.

35:08.005 --> 35:10.975
- Oh, okay.
- Uh, I'm Jeremy.

35:11.709 --> 35:13.945
Well, wait. You're the mechanic?

35:15.146 --> 35:16.347
Yeah.

35:17.915 --> 35:19.283
That's cool.

35:19.283 --> 35:20.284
Yo, yo, yo, yo!

35:31.362 --> 35:33.131
Hey, what's up with it?

35:33.131 --> 35:36.567
Yo, you gotta have red hair
to work over here?

35:36.567 --> 35:39.203
Hey, I heard y'all hiring
a black dudes. That true?

35:39.203 --> 35:40.805
That's Derwin.

35:43.941 --> 35:46.244
Yeah, D.H. said
he was a good mechanic.

35:46.244 --> 35:47.512
Couldn't tell by his car.

35:47.512 --> 35:49.614
That car was in a
junkyard yesterday.

35:49.614 --> 35:52.350
Engine hadn't been turned
over since before I was born.

35:52.350 --> 35:54.819
I mean, could you get
that car working in one day?

35:54.819 --> 35:59.223
Hey, yo-yo! Yo,
Charlie, check this out!

36:03.828 --> 36:05.263
Yeah.

36:06.764 --> 36:08.866
I be waving, ho-ho-ho!

36:08.866 --> 36:10.801
Yeah, Derwin!

36:19.477 --> 36:21.145
That can't be right.

36:24.549 --> 36:25.883
No.

36:26.417 --> 36:28.052
No-no-no.

36:28.052 --> 36:30.421
Okay, so, I mean,
that was impressive.

36:30.421 --> 36:31.989
That car was on
blocks yesterday?

36:31.989 --> 36:33.758
- Yeah. Okay.

36:33.758 --> 36:34.892
Thank you, man.

36:34.892 --> 36:36.861
What kind of engine is in it?

36:36.861 --> 36:39.964
Just some parts I put together.
A little this, a little that.

36:39.964 --> 36:41.832
- You just made it up?
- Yeah.

36:41.832 --> 36:44.101
Wow, that's
pretty impressive.

37:01.319 --> 37:03.688
So, you, how old are you?

37:03.688 --> 37:05.056
I'm 20.

37:09.126 --> 37:10.294
What's up?

37:10.294 --> 37:11.929
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

37:11.929 --> 37:14.532
Hey, I'm gonna need you
to check out my freeze-on.

37:15.233 --> 37:16.400
The what?

37:17.235 --> 37:20.504
My freeze-on. Yeah.

37:22.206 --> 37:24.342
Your air conditioner?

37:24.342 --> 37:28.879
No, Gingerbread. What I'm saying
is, my sea foam green Sprite.

37:28.879 --> 37:31.282
You know what I'm sayin'?
My frostbite kryptonite.

37:32.016 --> 37:33.918
Oh yeah, your antifreeze.

37:34.418 --> 37:37.488
- Yeah, that's it. Yeah.
- All right, pop the hood.

37:37.488 --> 37:39.624
Antifreeze!

37:44.128 --> 37:47.531
Can you tell me
some qualifications that you
have, that--

37:48.366 --> 37:50.768
I wouldn't touch it
'til it stops, man.

37:50.768 --> 37:54.505
Yeah, yeah. You know,
I grew up working in my Da-

37:55.106 --> 37:56.540
Can you excuse me for a second?

37:56.540 --> 37:58.109
- Okay.
- Thanks.

37:58.442 --> 38:00.745
Trying to figure out
these hydraulics, man,

38:00.745 --> 38:02.546
I'll pop it in a second.
- Hey, Mac Daddy.

38:02.546 --> 38:03.714
Yo, C-Train.

38:03.714 --> 38:05.516
How I get this
wheel to chill, man?

38:05.516 --> 38:07.118
It's got my eyeballs
banging around

38:07.118 --> 38:08.653
like some dimes in a piggybank.

38:08.653 --> 38:10.321
Turn the music down.

38:10.321 --> 38:12.990
- What?
- Turn the music down.

38:16.394 --> 38:19.497
What in the
G-Washington is going on?

38:19.497 --> 38:21.165
What'd I tell you
not to forget?

38:22.466 --> 38:23.901
I forgot.

38:23.901 --> 38:25.903
I wired in a sound sensor.

38:25.903 --> 38:28.472
When you have it activated
and the music's up,

38:28.472 --> 38:32.143
the car bounces-
--The car bounces on its own.

38:32.143 --> 38:33.811
All right, now. You know. Yeah.

38:33.811 --> 38:35.479
It's just, I'm getting
used to everything,

38:35.479 --> 38:39.016
you know, because there's
a lot of bells and whistles
in this circus.

38:40.685 --> 38:43.487
She put the hydraulic
system in there.

38:43.487 --> 38:45.189
Yeah, she did.

38:45.189 --> 38:47.558
All right, so all I gotta do
is flip the switch right here.

38:50.995 --> 38:52.163
That's it.

38:53.364 --> 38:55.232
- Oh!
- Whoa!

38:55.633 --> 38:57.234
Oh no!

38:59.570 --> 39:02.907
Turn it off! Turn it off!

39:05.943 --> 39:07.211
Jeremy.

39:10.648 --> 39:12.917
You look like you could
use a beer.

39:13.751 --> 39:15.086
Yeah.

39:16.120 --> 39:17.922
I got eaten by a car.

39:17.922 --> 39:19.457
It happens.

39:19.457 --> 39:21.926
One birch beer coming up.

39:21.926 --> 39:23.427
No, I'm fine.

39:23.994 --> 39:25.629
Ice cold. Foamy.

39:26.130 --> 39:27.431
That bad, huh?

39:28.199 --> 39:30.234
I bet it's not so bad
that you couldn't fix it

39:30.234 --> 39:32.436
with a quick ride
around the track.

39:33.204 --> 39:34.405
Come on!

41:00.057 --> 41:02.560
Wow, I didn't know
this was back here.

41:02.560 --> 41:04.161
Yeah, I keep this open
during the summer

41:04.161 --> 41:06.430
just for the next generation.

41:07.531 --> 41:09.033
You feel better?

41:09.033 --> 41:10.734
Yeah. That was great.

41:14.271 --> 41:18.342
you got a lot of your
granddaddy's blood in
you, Jeremy.

41:19.944 --> 41:22.713
I don't know if you'd ever
be interested, but...

41:24.381 --> 41:27.051
...if you are,I believe
you could race.

41:27.051 --> 41:29.687
I got a feeling you could
go straight to crates.

41:30.454 --> 41:31.622
Really?

41:31.622 --> 41:32.823
Oh, yeah.

41:35.659 --> 41:37.027
Think about it.

41:38.462 --> 41:39.730
I'll think about it.

41:48.506 --> 41:50.274
Hey, Hank, grab you one
while it's open.

41:50.274 --> 41:51.876
Don't reckon I will.

41:51.876 --> 41:53.844
Oh, go 'head.
It's just a quarter. Go 'head.

41:54.645 --> 41:58.916
Don't make no difference
whether it's 25 cents
or a million.

41:58.916 --> 42:01.719
Dishonest gain don't profit.

42:05.489 --> 42:07.658
You know what, Hank?
You're right.

42:08.392 --> 42:10.160
I wouldn't want anybody
doing that to me.

42:11.228 --> 42:13.163
So, thank you.

42:13.998 --> 42:15.499
I knew there was a reason
I kept you around

42:15.499 --> 42:17.101
besides that pretty smile
of yours.

42:19.503 --> 42:20.804
Mr. Williamson.

42:20.804 --> 42:22.273
Oh. Hey, Mr. Clark.
How you doing?

42:22.273 --> 42:23.340
I missed you yesterday.

42:23.340 --> 42:24.875
I need to speak with you
and your wife.

42:24.875 --> 42:27.077
It's sort of urgent.

42:27.478 --> 42:29.780
Okay. Come on in to the office.

42:30.614 --> 42:32.917
There was an oversight
with your father's estate.

42:35.052 --> 42:38.822
- Okay. Go on.
- Local woman, Betty Tucker,
just passed.

42:38.822 --> 42:40.124
Turns out she didn't have a will

42:40.124 --> 42:43.127
so I was assigned by the state
to handle her affairs.

42:43.127 --> 42:44.428
Something like this
isn't gonna be on record,

42:44.428 --> 42:46.497
but the truth is,
these sort of things

42:46.497 --> 42:48.699
are pretty common
in small towns.

42:48.699 --> 42:50.601
What sort of thing
are you talking about?

42:52.303 --> 42:54.772
Clem had a notarized,
personal loan with Betty Tucker.

42:56.273 --> 42:59.343
He used the station
as collateral, so technically,

42:59.343 --> 43:00.844
Miss Betty owns the garage.

43:00.844 --> 43:02.780
And, since she didn't
have a will...

43:02.780 --> 43:04.782
...her estate's gotta be sold
at public auction.

43:04.782 --> 43:06.250
What?

43:06.250 --> 43:10.588
Total amount with interest owed
is $118,328.34.

43:10.588 --> 43:12.523
That's, great. Hey, Dad, thank
you so much

43:12.523 --> 43:13.958
for the service station.

43:16.927 --> 43:18.562
What did I tell you?

43:18.562 --> 43:19.797
Just enough to sucker punch us.

43:19.797 --> 43:21.098
I know. Just wait.

43:21.098 --> 43:23.000
Let's just get all
the information.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.869
Debt has to be paid by the time
it goes on the auction block.

43:27.004 --> 43:28.672
You have 60 days.

43:29.773 --> 43:31.542
How could you have
not told us about this?

43:31.542 --> 43:33.010
I don't understand.

43:33.010 --> 43:35.346
Was this somewhere--
- I'm gonna let you all alone to
talk about this.

43:50.527 --> 43:51.762
Hey!

43:52.763 --> 43:54.898
Just to show you
what a nice guy I am...

43:54.898 --> 43:58.335
...I'm gonna call Q-Mark on
your behalves...

43:58.335 --> 44:01.305
...see if I can get ya jobs
in the stockroom, huh?

44:02.439 --> 44:04.842
Tom, you started there,
didn't ya?

44:07.511 --> 44:09.747
Hey, I'll see ya at the auction.

44:09.747 --> 44:12.349
No, I won't.[laughing]

44:12.349 --> 44:13.584
I won't!

44:23.327 --> 44:24.595
What'd I miss?

44:24.595 --> 44:28.065
Right when I started thinking
my dad might not
be so screwed up.

44:28.065 --> 44:29.400
Dad, what do you mean?

44:32.102 --> 44:35.239
The station has to be sold
at auction.

44:35.239 --> 44:38.275
We have 60 days to come up
with $120,000.

44:38.275 --> 44:40.310
- What?
- Why is that?

44:40.310 --> 44:43.781
Because my dad
spent my future, again.

44:48.352 --> 44:51.255
Derwin, can we get back to...

44:53.157 --> 44:54.725
Why are you being so selfish?

44:54.725 --> 44:56.160
I'm being selfish?

44:56.160 --> 44:58.462
Your daddy was dying of cancer.

44:58.462 --> 44:59.963
Did you even know that?

45:01.765 --> 45:04.768
My dad made it very clear to me

45:04.768 --> 45:06.570
that I was not an important
part of his life.

45:06.570 --> 45:10.374
So excuse me if I didn't
check in on a regular basis!

45:12.342 --> 45:15.079
Your daddy was torn up
over you, Tommy.

45:15.079 --> 45:16.980
Now maybe you never knew that.

45:16.980 --> 45:21.785
and he knew that he treated
you wrong in a lot of ways.

45:22.619 --> 45:24.555
Clem didn't know
how to say sorry.

45:24.555 --> 45:26.156
But right now,

45:26.156 --> 45:28.992
you gotta find a way
to get over all that.

45:28.992 --> 45:32.196
You gotta forget about
everything you don't have.

45:32.196 --> 45:34.698
You gotta forget about
what you missed out on.

45:34.698 --> 45:38.001
You gotta see
what you do have...

45:38.001 --> 45:40.070
...right here, right now, son.

45:42.106 --> 45:44.808
You wanna see a
Q-Mark sitting on this spot?

45:46.376 --> 45:49.113
Do ya?
- No.

45:50.147 --> 45:52.316
Then do something about it.

45:59.523 --> 46:00.891
All right.

46:01.725 --> 46:02.860
All right.

46:02.860 --> 46:04.628
I'm gonna need everybody's help.

46:07.164 --> 46:08.599
Just tell 'em.

46:09.199 --> 46:10.534
Hey, guys.

46:14.605 --> 46:15.506
What d'ya think, Mom?

46:16.240 --> 46:18.008
Oh, that looks
really nice, baby.

46:18.008 --> 46:18.809
Good job.

46:18.809 --> 46:23.847
I need you to get this running,
and, set it to a dollar.

46:23.847 --> 46:25.516
Okay? Awesome.

46:27.618 --> 46:29.820
Hey, how old is this thing, man?

46:39.630 --> 46:40.497
Oh!

47:03.720 --> 47:05.756
Hey. I got ya. I got ya. Yeah.

47:11.495 --> 47:13.931
Oh, you're kidding me!
[loud truck horn]

47:13.931 --> 47:15.766
What's up with this vacuum!

47:19.803 --> 47:21.538
What can I do for you?

47:22.239 --> 47:24.341
Fill 'er up. High test.

47:24.341 --> 47:25.809
Oh, you bet!

47:30.747 --> 47:34.084
The bottom line is
that we're just short 85K.

47:37.821 --> 47:39.022
Use my college money.

47:40.224 --> 47:42.826
We'd still be 50 K
in the deficit, sweetie.

47:45.329 --> 47:47.497
No, we're not using
your college money.

47:47.497 --> 47:50.167
You wanna invest in
my future, put it in the shop.

47:50.934 --> 47:52.236
Dad, look.

47:55.172 --> 47:57.107
This will make up
the difference.

47:59.343 --> 48:02.579
We're gonna win this place,
just like granddad did.

48:02.913 --> 48:04.581
Come on, we got a garage.
We know how to do this.

48:04.581 --> 48:07.718
All right, even if I thought
this was a good idea,
which I don't...

48:07.718 --> 48:11.555
you would still need a car,
not to mention a driver,
to win a race.

48:11.555 --> 48:14.424
Car's not a problem. I have a
friend who's got an old chassis.

48:15.092 --> 48:17.261
And I can call in some favors
and get us a good motor.

48:17.261 --> 48:18.962
Yeah, you got a
driver right here.

48:19.096 --> 48:20.030
Jeremy.

48:20.397 --> 48:21.965
Dad, come- I could so do this.

48:21.965 --> 48:23.066
He's amazing.

48:23.066 --> 48:23.901
You just haven't seen him.

48:23.901 --> 48:24.868
What're you doing?

48:25.769 --> 48:27.471
It's completely different.

48:27.471 --> 48:28.772
I think it's worth a shot.

48:28.772 --> 48:30.274
Do you have a better idea?

48:30.274 --> 48:31.975
Well, yeah, how 'bout
we go to Vegas...

48:31.975 --> 48:32.910
and roll it all on black.

48:32.910 --> 48:37.080
Look, this is the
U.S. Open of dirt track racing.

48:37.080 --> 48:39.583
We're not gonna enter
a race for the money.

48:39.583 --> 48:41.551
Can we just hear
what he's got to say?

48:43.921 --> 48:46.590
What I'm saying is...
the top ten earners,

48:46.590 --> 48:47.824
they're in the big
race automatically.

48:48.125 --> 48:49.626
The rest of 'em
gotta qualify to race.

48:49.626 --> 48:51.595
And your boy, he can drive.

48:52.195 --> 48:53.063
Yeah.

48:55.632 --> 49:00.570
Has anyone from the open race
ever won the money?

49:00.570 --> 49:02.572
Yeah. Two that we know of.

49:02.572 --> 49:04.474
Your dad and Conrad.

49:33.537 --> 49:34.371
Get us the car.

49:34.371 --> 49:38.041
- That's what I'm talking about.
- You are not gonna
regret this--

49:38.041 --> 49:40.243
If anybody's gonna do this,
it's gonna be me.

49:41.411 --> 49:42.279
What?

49:42.279 --> 49:43.280
Come on, I used to race.

49:43.280 --> 49:44.414
I won trophies.

49:44.414 --> 49:46.350
D.H. is just gonna have to
give me a refresher.

49:46.350 --> 49:47.484
You're so full of crap.

49:47.484 --> 49:48.785
It is my responsibility.

49:48.785 --> 49:50.287
It is my way or it's not at all.

49:50.287 --> 49:51.355
What're you talking about?
You're not even around!

49:51.355 --> 49:52.856
All you do is work!

49:52.856 --> 49:54.825
Okay, you've never once
come to something I'm good at.

49:54.825 --> 49:56.059
Not once!

49:56.059 --> 49:57.828
Okay, I've had to work
so much because...

49:57.828 --> 49:59.229
I don't have a college
degree, Jeremy!

49:59.229 --> 50:00.831
Well then, why don't you
go get one!

50:00.831 --> 50:03.367
'Cause I didn't even send in
the stupid application!

50:08.705 --> 50:09.873
Tell him, Mom!

50:14.711 --> 50:16.580
You knew about that?

50:23.253 --> 50:24.154
Tom.

50:28.792 --> 50:30.694
- Jeremy.
- I don't wanna hear it, Mom.

50:30.694 --> 50:31.995
Oh, excuse me.

50:33.096 --> 50:35.432
Don't do this for your father,
do this for yourself.

50:35.432 --> 50:36.933
It's just like him.

50:36.933 --> 50:38.668
Always thinking of himself.

50:38.668 --> 50:40.203
All right, I'm not a
little kid anymore.

50:40.203 --> 50:41.004
I can do this.

50:41.004 --> 50:42.039
I know that.

50:42.039 --> 50:43.673
You've grown up so much.

50:44.041 --> 50:45.442
But honor your father.

50:45.442 --> 50:48.612
And like it or not, he is trying
to look out for you.

50:48.612 --> 50:50.747
He's not trying to
look out for me.

50:50.747 --> 50:53.517
Yes he is. He is trying to give
you a better life
than what he had.

50:53.517 --> 50:56.219
He has zero prospects right now.

50:56.219 --> 50:57.254
Do you understand that?

50:57.254 --> 50:59.790
His life is crumbling
around him.

51:00.457 --> 51:01.892
And he's not just
thinking of himself.

51:01.892 --> 51:03.326
He's thinking of our family.

51:05.162 --> 51:08.231
Jeremy, you threw me
under the bus.

51:13.303 --> 51:14.504
I'm gonna go talk to him.

51:22.279 --> 51:24.147
That's what this is about,
being too protective.

51:24.147 --> 51:26.083
- That's what I'm saying.
- Okay, don't. Just stop.

51:26.083 --> 51:27.984
I don't wanna talk
about it right now.

51:27.984 --> 51:30.087
Tom, talk to me!

51:30.087 --> 51:31.721
What do you wanna talk about?

51:31.721 --> 51:36.059
How 'bout the fact that I was
19 when we got married and you
were 22.

51:36.059 --> 51:38.862
He's big enough to start
making his own decisions.

51:38.862 --> 51:40.297
Okay, don't turn this
around on me.

51:40.297 --> 51:41.531
It is entirely different.

51:41.531 --> 51:43.667
My dad was a deadbeat.

51:43.667 --> 51:45.735
I was on my own since I was 14.

51:45.735 --> 51:46.570
I had to figure it out.

51:46.570 --> 51:47.471
He's got a father.

51:47.471 --> 51:48.271
I've been here.

51:48.271 --> 51:49.072
Not really.

51:49.072 --> 51:50.674
You've kinda been at Q-Mark.

51:53.743 --> 51:55.378
Okay. Awesome.

51:55.378 --> 51:58.148
So, I'm not only a
failure as a provider...

51:58.148 --> 52:00.183
I'm a failure as a father, too?
That's awesome.

52:00.183 --> 52:02.352
Thank you so much for
the pep talk. I appreciate it!

52:02.886 --> 52:03.753
Stop it!

52:04.121 --> 52:05.122
I've watched this kid.

52:05.122 --> 52:06.289
I know what he excels in.

52:06.289 --> 52:08.225
He has a gift, and it runs deep.

52:08.225 --> 52:10.093
Do not let your past dictate
his future because...

52:10.093 --> 52:12.696
you will stay disappointed
for the rest of your life.

52:12.696 --> 52:15.966
It is my responsibility
to provide for this family.

52:15.966 --> 52:17.400
It is too dangerous.

52:17.400 --> 52:18.969
Give him a chance.

52:31.014 --> 52:32.582
Hey.

52:33.650 --> 52:34.518
- Hey.

52:34.518 --> 52:37.420
Your mom said you were
back here. What's wrong?

52:38.355 --> 52:39.222
Nothin'.

52:41.525 --> 52:44.227
I just thought having a family
business would change things.

52:44.961 --> 52:48.031
And when I saw it was a shop,
I was so excited, you know?

52:48.031 --> 52:50.934
Like, maybe he'll see me,
see something I'm good at.

52:53.236 --> 52:55.071
Of course I just,
I screw it all up.

52:57.674 --> 52:58.742
I actually meant the car.

53:01.678 --> 53:06.483
Yeah, I've tried everything.
It just- it won't start.

53:10.453 --> 53:12.422
Ahh. Here it is.

53:16.259 --> 53:18.295
What are the two things
essential to a motor?

53:20.230 --> 53:21.498
Fire and fuel.

53:22.766 --> 53:23.633
That's right.

53:24.534 --> 53:26.369
There's a mutual
relationship between...

53:26.369 --> 53:27.571
the carburetor and the engine.

53:27.804 --> 53:31.141
This little bitty wire
makes it all work.

53:32.776 --> 53:37.280
This line of communication
is busted, the whole
thing doesn't work.

53:40.684 --> 53:41.551
Turn it over.

53:58.902 --> 54:00.170
Let's go for a spin.

54:07.277 --> 54:11.348
- This is an old bootlegger's
road my grandpa used to take me.

54:13.750 --> 54:16.353
Kinda cool, isn't it?
- Yeah.

54:19.155 --> 54:20.724
So how do you know
so much about cars?

54:21.925 --> 54:23.093
I was a shop rat.

54:24.894 --> 54:26.696
My mom left when I was three.

54:26.696 --> 54:29.799
Dad started taking me
to the shop after that.

54:30.667 --> 54:33.570
And I was changing spark plugs
by the time I was eight.

54:33.570 --> 54:34.537
Eight?

54:34.537 --> 54:36.072
- What?
- Yeah.

54:36.072 --> 54:38.408
Complete rebuilds
by the time I was 10.

54:41.911 --> 54:43.246
Yeah, that's all
I've ever known.

54:45.482 --> 54:47.183
It's the only thing I'm good at.

54:50.487 --> 54:55.458
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Man, I wish my dad
was like that.

54:55.458 --> 54:57.761
He just always wants me to
be something I'm not.

54:58.461 --> 55:00.263
I mean, I wanted
to play with dolls...

55:01.931 --> 55:03.199
but my dad needed me.

55:04.367 --> 55:06.536
And I didn't want to-
- Yeah, let him down.

55:08.071 --> 55:08.938
Yeah, me neither.

55:11.141 --> 55:13.543
He did the best he could
with the cards he was dealt.

55:15.145 --> 55:16.279
And I love him for it.

55:23.119 --> 55:25.889
Whoa, slow down there, cowboy.

55:27.123 --> 55:29.559
I just- I thought that
we were like--

55:29.559 --> 55:30.593
No.

55:35.131 --> 55:36.032
Okay.

55:36.032 --> 55:39.436
About a quarter mile ahead is a
dog leg turn to the left.

55:39.436 --> 55:42.305
I have taken it as fast as 65.

55:44.541 --> 55:45.575
Let's see what you got.

57:11.428 --> 57:12.295
Now come on.

57:12.295 --> 57:13.329
That was pretty good, right?

57:14.097 --> 57:14.998
I was doing good.

57:15.899 --> 57:16.966
I'm getting the hang of it.

57:20.904 --> 57:22.772
You're too timid
with your driving.

57:22.772 --> 57:26.109
You're gonna have 450 horses
under your control.

57:26.109 --> 57:29.479
Either you control the car,
or the car will control you.

57:36.653 --> 57:37.887
Jeremy, come here a minute.

57:39.255 --> 57:40.523
Stand here and face your dad.

57:42.192 --> 57:45.528
Now look at your son
and tell him to eat your dust.

57:45.528 --> 57:47.263
- Really?
- Do it.

57:51.334 --> 57:52.402
Eat my dust.

57:53.369 --> 57:54.237
Well that was pitiful.

57:54.237 --> 57:57.540
Look at your dad
and tell him to kiss your grits.

57:59.175 --> 58:01.010
- Who says that?
- Do it.

58:03.480 --> 58:04.581
Kiss my grits.

58:04.581 --> 58:06.816
Oh, pitiful must run
in this family.

58:06.816 --> 58:07.684
Do it again.

58:09.152 --> 58:10.420
Kiss my grits.

58:20.597 --> 58:21.931
Eat my dust.

58:25.602 --> 58:26.903
Kiss my grits.

58:30.006 --> 58:31.140
Eat my dust.

58:33.443 --> 58:34.477
Kiss my grits.

58:38.214 --> 58:39.382
Eat my dust.

58:39.382 --> 58:41.651
- Kiss my grits.
- Eat my dust.

58:41.651 --> 58:42.785
Kiss my grits.

58:42.785 --> 58:45.221
- Eat my dust.
- Kiss my grits.

58:45.221 --> 58:47.323
- Eat my dust.
- Whoa! Whoa!

58:47.323 --> 58:49.058
We are racing now!

58:51.728 --> 58:53.162
Bring it on down.
Bring it on down.

58:54.230 --> 58:57.333
Now that's the kind of focus
you're gonna need, right there.

58:57.333 --> 59:02.071
You weren't worried about your
shop, or your debts...
or anything except winning.

59:03.873 --> 59:07.544
When you're in that car,
you cannot be distracted.

59:08.077 --> 59:10.480
You can't take your mind
off what you're doing
for a second.

59:10.480 --> 59:15.418
If you see an opportunity
and you hesitate,
you lost already.

59:16.653 --> 59:18.121
That's the focus, right there.

59:19.889 --> 59:20.823
Great.

59:21.157 --> 59:22.559
That's good enough for today.

59:35.905 --> 59:36.706
You guys hungry?

59:36.706 --> 59:38.441
Oh, just in time to help.

59:39.075 --> 59:39.976
Can you handle that, dog?

59:39.976 --> 59:41.444
You wanna find out?

59:41.444 --> 59:43.079
- Yeah. Show me.
- All right.

01:00:25.989 --> 01:00:27.290
Jeremy, pass him.

01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:29.158
He's leaving himself wide open.

01:00:31.094 --> 01:00:32.562
Tom, don't let him pass you.

01:00:32.562 --> 01:00:33.396
Tighten it up.

01:00:33.396 --> 01:00:35.765
I'm trying. He's good.

01:00:50.613 --> 01:00:51.514
Dang.

01:00:51.948 --> 01:00:53.449
You bullied your
way to the inside.

01:00:54.117 --> 01:00:55.618
He didn't bully
his way anywhere.

01:00:55.618 --> 01:00:57.353
You left yourself wide open.

01:00:57.353 --> 01:00:58.254
He took advantage of it.

01:00:58.254 --> 01:00:59.255
That's racing.

01:00:59.255 --> 01:01:01.391
You're racing one
guy in a go-cart.

01:01:01.391 --> 01:01:03.326
You ain't even touched
the race car yet...

01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:06.129
and you're gonna have to
find your way to the front
of 30 cars.

01:01:08.131 --> 01:01:09.932
Racing is position.

01:01:10.366 --> 01:01:12.635
Position's about fighting
for your territory.

01:01:12.635 --> 01:01:16.205
Once you get your hands on it,
you don't give it up
for nothin'.

01:01:16.873 --> 01:01:18.841
All right, put your
hats on, girls.

01:01:18.841 --> 01:01:20.076
Let's try it one more time.

01:01:23.413 --> 01:01:24.147
Here we go.

01:01:30.386 --> 01:01:34.023
We're running a 350 small block
with a four barrel carburetor...

01:01:34.023 --> 01:01:35.692
bumps it up to 450 horses.

01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:38.061
- Wow.
- Boo-ya!

01:01:38.194 --> 01:01:39.629
Wow! This is amazing.

01:01:39.629 --> 01:01:41.464
How did you guys get this done
so fast?  This is--

01:01:41.464 --> 01:01:43.599
No-no, this belongs
to the track.

01:01:43.599 --> 01:01:46.369
No, they give rides in this.
We just borrowed this for today.

01:01:46.369 --> 01:01:47.537
Yeah, that ain't you.

01:01:48.471 --> 01:01:50.840
That's yours. Right there.

01:01:53.509 --> 01:01:54.477
That's ugly.

01:01:54.477 --> 01:01:57.413
It's still got the same
size engine, so it'll handle.

01:01:57.413 --> 01:01:59.115
It'll run like a scalded dog.

01:02:16.833 --> 01:02:18.301
- I see you got it running.
- Yeah.

01:02:18.901 --> 01:02:20.069
Heads up.

01:02:21.137 --> 01:02:22.205
What is that for?

01:02:22.205 --> 01:02:24.640
You didn't think you was
running out here by yourself,
did ya?

01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:27.643
Little competition will be
good for ya, baby.

01:02:27.643 --> 01:02:29.011
See what you got.

01:02:31.047 --> 01:02:32.849
All right, fine,
get it off the hitch.

01:02:32.849 --> 01:02:34.617
Whoa, no-no.

01:02:34.617 --> 01:02:36.919
You drivin' number 15.

01:02:36.919 --> 01:02:39.388
You need to practice
on the one you're racing in.

01:02:39.388 --> 01:02:40.490
- Exactly.

01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:49.866
All right, let's get
the rust off.

01:02:51.033 --> 01:02:52.268
Here we go, all right.

01:02:56.572 --> 01:02:58.474
Take it easy, Tom. Feel it out.

01:03:00.042 --> 01:03:01.077
Roger that.

01:03:06.816 --> 01:03:08.151
Yeah, that thing your foot's on,

01:03:08.151 --> 01:03:09.252
it's called a brake.

01:03:09.252 --> 01:03:10.987
That's real funny, Jeremy.

01:03:10.987 --> 01:03:12.522
Real funny.

01:03:16.859 --> 01:03:18.895
Whoa. It feels loose.

01:03:18.895 --> 01:03:19.695
I think it's the car.

01:03:19.695 --> 01:03:21.063
It's not the car.

01:03:21.063 --> 01:03:22.165
You've just got a
little more power.

01:03:22.165 --> 01:03:24.066
All right. Gotcha.

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:33.342
Stay with him, stay with him,
stay with him.

01:03:35.244 --> 01:03:36.712
All right, let's see
what you really got.

01:03:39.048 --> 01:03:39.916
No!

01:03:43.452 --> 01:03:44.687
Need to tweak anything, now?

01:03:45.521 --> 01:03:46.956
Yeah. The driver.

01:03:48.090 --> 01:03:50.126
All right, come on fellas,
bring it in. Bring it in.

01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:07.210
I was running good.

01:04:07.210 --> 01:04:08.311
It got away from me.

01:04:09.045 --> 01:04:10.746
No, you weren't running good.

01:04:10.746 --> 01:04:13.115
That last turn is the first time

01:04:13.115 --> 01:04:14.483
you ever really punched it.

01:04:14.483 --> 01:04:17.620
And punchin' it's where
you gotta live for
the entire race.

01:04:18.554 --> 01:04:20.323
You get back out there
and give me 20 more laps.

01:04:20.556 --> 01:04:21.724
Jeremy, you're in front.

01:04:22.725 --> 01:04:26.495
Tom, I want you to
work on passing. Okay?

01:04:26.929 --> 01:04:28.397
Make him work for it, Jeremy.

01:04:38.474 --> 01:04:40.076
How's that dust taste,
Dad?

01:04:40.076 --> 01:04:42.578
- Jeremy, shut up and drive.

01:04:48.484 --> 01:04:49.719
Bring it, Tom, bring it!

01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:12.441
So are you ready
to start racing yet?

01:05:16.479 --> 01:05:18.047
Okay, now he's gettin' it.

01:05:22.485 --> 01:05:24.654
Yeah! Yeah!

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:29.025
Your gas is on the right.

01:05:33.429 --> 01:05:35.698
Come on. You gotta keep up.
You gotta keep up!

01:05:39.802 --> 01:05:41.170
So that's how you wanna play.

01:05:43.839 --> 01:05:45.408
Come on, come on.

01:05:45.408 --> 01:05:46.642
Nice!

01:05:46.642 --> 01:05:48.411
- Now he's got it.
- Yeah, he's got it now.

01:05:52.381 --> 01:05:53.549
D.H., watch this!

01:05:53.549 --> 01:05:55.284
Don't go high. Don't go high!

01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:01.824
Oh, no.

01:06:11.334 --> 01:06:12.702
Dad!

01:06:27.049 --> 01:06:29.018
I'm so glad you're okay, baby.

01:06:33.089 --> 01:06:35.658
Keep this on you, there,
for 20 minutes.

01:06:46.569 --> 01:06:50.373
Ow. Ow. Oh.

01:06:55.911 --> 01:06:57.747
Ow.

01:06:59.815 --> 01:07:02.351
Ow!

01:07:52.535 --> 01:07:57.740
“Dear Tom, I've sent several
letters, but they've
all come back.”

01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:00.376
“I'm having my lawyer
look for you now.”

01:08:00.376 --> 01:08:04.980
“Can't say as I blame you
wanting to forget me.

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:10.586
“I've got a lot of regrets.
Sure ain't sitting here wishing

01:08:10.586 --> 01:08:15.458
“That's for darn sure. I just
want to say, I'm sorry, son.”

01:08:15.458 --> 01:08:18.394
“I did you and your mama wrong.

01:08:18.394 --> 01:08:22.598
“I was selfish and
I regret ever loosing you.

01:08:22.598 --> 01:08:26.734
“Treasure your family, son.
Trust me.”

01:08:26.734 --> 01:08:30.473
“Sitting where I'm sitting,
it's a cold place alone.

01:08:30.473 --> 01:08:33.742
“I pray this letter
finds you someday.

01:08:33.742 --> 01:08:36.812
“I love you, son."

01:08:53.929 --> 01:08:57.633
Oh, you're right, but I still
don't know what we're gonna do.

01:08:57.633 --> 01:08:58.667
I know.

01:09:00.202 --> 01:09:02.505
I come in peace. I come
in peace.

01:09:04.506 --> 01:09:07.776
I was wondering, how is he?

01:09:11.546 --> 01:09:12.615
What're you doing here?

01:09:12.615 --> 01:09:15.751
While it was very noble of you
to try and win the money...

01:09:15.751 --> 01:09:17.553
you and I both know
that there's no way...

01:09:17.553 --> 01:09:20.689
you are gonna beat me
this weekend.

01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:25.361
So, if you sign these papers,
I don't have to go
to the auction...

01:09:25.361 --> 01:09:28.063
you can put all
this mess behind ya...

01:09:28.063 --> 01:09:31.167
and we can both move on
with our lives.

01:09:34.937 --> 01:09:35.938
He's right.

01:09:35.938 --> 01:09:37.173
Dad, no.

01:09:37.173 --> 01:09:40.042
- What? No, he's not right.-
Really?

01:09:41.544 --> 01:09:42.478
Here you go.

01:09:42.478 --> 01:09:44.345
I even brought a desk for ya.

01:09:57.393 --> 01:09:58.260
There ya go.

01:10:00.262 --> 01:10:01.230
Thank you very much.

01:10:02.131 --> 01:10:03.766
It's been a pleasure doing --

01:10:03.766 --> 01:10:04.833
Yeah, you read that right.

01:10:06.535 --> 01:10:10.239
See You At The Race.

01:10:11.574 --> 01:10:13.876
Now take your papers and
your fake Armani suit...

01:10:13.876 --> 01:10:17.213
and get back in your car
over there and get off my porch.

01:10:22.218 --> 01:10:23.452
It's not fake.

01:10:32.761 --> 01:10:34.263
We're gonna need a car.

01:10:34.697 --> 01:10:36.065
And a sponsor.

01:10:36.899 --> 01:10:37.833
What about a driver?

01:10:40.736 --> 01:10:43.505
You wanted trust. Here it is.

01:10:53.716 --> 01:10:58.287
This is the car Lug Nut used
to beat Conrad the first time.

01:10:58.988 --> 01:11:01.624
I think it's time she showed her
teeth again.

01:11:09.164 --> 01:11:10.199
Yeah, this is D.H.

01:11:10.199 --> 01:11:12.801
All right, Derwin, Charlie,
when you get back...

01:11:12.801 --> 01:11:14.937
salvage whatever you can
off the other car.

01:11:14.937 --> 01:11:15.738
All right, I gotta take this.

01:11:15.738 --> 01:11:16.639
Could be a sponsor.

01:11:16.639 --> 01:11:18.507
Hey Hals, how ya doin'?

01:11:22.211 --> 01:11:23.445
What have I done?

01:11:23.445 --> 01:11:24.647
I mean, this is a mistake.

01:11:24.647 --> 01:11:26.081
It's a mistake.

01:11:26.081 --> 01:11:28.484
Tom, just take a breath.

01:11:30.586 --> 01:11:35.424
Honey, if he doesn't win,
we lose everything.

01:11:35.424 --> 01:11:37.092
It's too much pressure
on the kid.

01:11:37.092 --> 01:11:38.694
It's too much pressure on him...

01:11:38.694 --> 01:11:40.462
if you don't give
him your support

01:11:40.462 --> 01:11:41.930
and your confidence.

01:11:43.899 --> 01:11:47.369
Honey, this relationship that
you're building with our son...

01:11:48.871 --> 01:11:51.440
it's more important
than anything we own.

01:11:55.277 --> 01:11:56.478
God, I love you.

01:12:07.656 --> 01:12:08.857
Why don't we go lock up.

01:12:10.059 --> 01:12:10.993
Okay.

01:12:13.495 --> 01:12:14.496
Believe in him.

01:12:15.464 --> 01:12:17.066
I want you to
practice your turns.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.336
About all you'll be able to do,
this track is so small.

01:12:20.336 --> 01:12:22.471
But you need some
time in the car.

01:12:28.043 --> 01:12:29.111
Huh?

01:12:34.216 --> 01:12:35.084
What is it?

01:12:36.051 --> 01:12:37.686
It's just, I always wanted this.

01:12:39.054 --> 01:12:42.358
I always wanted my dad to trust
me with responsibilities
and what not

01:12:42.358 --> 01:12:44.293
Now that he does, I'm scared--

01:12:44.293 --> 01:12:45.394
Be stupid if you weren't.

01:13:05.314 --> 01:13:07.049
- Dad, look-
- No, Jeremy.

01:13:07.049 --> 01:13:08.217
- Look, Dad--
- Look, Jeremy--

01:13:10.452 --> 01:13:11.553
You go first.

01:13:15.357 --> 01:13:17.326
My dad was not a nice man.

01:13:17.326 --> 01:13:20.929
And he was always absent.

01:13:22.398 --> 01:13:28.604
So I've never had a good example
on how to do this, just--

01:13:29.772 --> 01:13:31.273
I just knew I had to do better.

01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:36.078
Dad, look, you don't
have to do this right now.

01:13:36.078 --> 01:13:37.012
Yeah, I do.

01:13:38.614 --> 01:13:42.151
And in trying to
provide you with more...

01:13:42.951 --> 01:13:44.686
I've done basically
the same thing he did.

01:13:46.388 --> 01:13:47.322
I haven't been there.

01:13:47.322 --> 01:13:50.559
Feel like I failed you.

01:13:50.559 --> 01:13:54.797
Yeah, but, none of that ever
mattered. All I ever wanted to

01:13:54.797 --> 01:13:57.866
do is just hang out with you.

01:14:05.841 --> 01:14:07.910
I didn't get to
see my dad change.

01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:10.112
I just heard about
it second hand.

01:14:10.112 --> 01:14:13.182
And I want you to see that
change in person.

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:21.390
But what if I fail?

01:14:22.157 --> 01:14:28.263
But what if you don't? And no
matter what happens tomorrow...

01:14:28.263 --> 01:14:33.802
Win or lose, you are
always going to be my son.

01:14:33.802 --> 01:14:36.872
There is nothing that is
going to change that.

01:14:38.173 --> 01:14:43.245
Now you go out there, and
you kick up some dirt.

01:14:44.046 --> 01:14:47.115
Don't drive with this.
Drive with this.

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:54.490
I love you so much.

01:14:57.860 --> 01:15:00.896
I love you, too.

01:15:00.896 --> 01:15:03.966
Go get 'em.

01:15:05.267 --> 01:15:08.337
The “H” is all yours..

01:15:25.854 --> 01:15:28.924
It's race day! The
U.S. Open of Dirt Track Racing!

01:15:30.325 --> 01:15:33.395
The Dirt Track Grand National
from Friendship Speedway is on.

01:15:34.263 --> 01:15:37.199
And the favorite today has
got to be Conrad Bangs.

01:15:37.199 --> 01:15:41.970
He's on a long winning
streak, and he's the oldest
driver still on

01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:45.541
the dirt track circuit. Not to
mention the most well financed.

01:16:11.533 --> 01:16:13.535
Couple more tweaks, and she'll
be good to go.

01:16:13.535 --> 01:16:16.605
Oh, by the way.
Here's your helmet.

01:16:21.743 --> 01:16:23.178
A chicken helmet?

01:16:23.178 --> 01:16:26.248
Personally, I don't eat
chickens, but your sponsor does,
and he'd

01:16:26.582 --> 01:16:29.585
appreciate it if
you'd wear it.

01:16:29.585 --> 01:16:31.520
Hey, look. At least it's kinda
grittin' it's teeth, right?

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:36.191
Yeah.
Grrr! [laughs] Come on, man.

01:16:36.191 --> 01:16:38.860
- Hey, Derwin!
- Jeremy?

01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:39.695
Charlie, Derwin, come here.

01:16:39.695 --> 01:16:42.497
Rick! What are you doing' here?

01:16:42.497 --> 01:16:44.199
You're not gonna race, are you?

01:16:44.199 --> 01:16:46.802
Yeah, yeah I'm up to qualify.

01:16:46.802 --> 01:16:49.905
Nice helmet.

01:16:52.341 --> 01:16:55.410
See you at the race.

01:16:59.147 --> 01:17:00.115
Who was that?

01:17:00.115 --> 01:17:02.517
Oh, it's no one.

01:17:02.517 --> 01:17:03.952
All right, well we goto get you
on the track.

01:17:03.952 --> 01:17:06.021
I'm gonna tell Carol, and I'll
see you at the crow's nest.

01:17:06.021 --> 01:17:08.357
All right, listen.

01:17:08.357 --> 01:17:11.426
To be a shoe in, you got to beat
18.5 seconds in the second lap.

01:17:12.995 --> 01:17:16.064
You can do this. All right.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.736
Hey guys...

01:17:20.736 --> 01:17:23.338
Does this look weird?

01:17:23.338 --> 01:17:26.408
It's kinda cute.

01:17:26.942 --> 01:17:30.012
Looks good for having' a beak.

01:17:32.614 --> 01:17:35.684
Oh, thank you.

01:17:45.193 --> 01:17:48.163
Whoo!

01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:00.275
Twenty-one seconds

01:18:00.275 --> 01:18:03.345
Just keep cool, we can
still make the race.

01:18:12.487 --> 01:18:14.389
Well, you're all set.

01:18:14.389 --> 01:18:16.158
You're running' 27th.

01:18:16.158 --> 01:18:18.694
Hey. Hey.

01:18:18.694 --> 01:18:20.429
Well, at least I'm not last.

01:18:20.429 --> 01:18:23.498
Well, you kinda are. Three
people are having mechanical
issues couldn't run.

01:18:23.999 --> 01:18:27.069
Hey, but that's good. That's
good. That's three people you
don't have to pass.

01:18:27.402 --> 01:18:28.770
- That's great.
- That's exactly right.

01:18:28.770 --> 01:18:32.741
Just got to come in 10th on
this one, that's all.

01:18:33.608 --> 01:18:36.678
Listen, just stay focused.
All you got to do is take down

01:18:36.812 --> 01:18:39.881
one care every three laps.
That's it.

01:18:40.015 --> 01:18:43.552
One car every three laps.
Okay, I got it,

01:18:44.486 --> 01:18:46.421
All right, now just stay focused
and just stay right on the-

01:18:46.421 --> 01:18:49.157
Dad. I got this.

01:18:56.531 --> 01:18:58.667
One car every three laps?
That's hard!

01:18:58.667 --> 01:19:01.002
Yeah, he don't know that.

01:19:03.138 --> 01:19:06.208
We're 20 laps in on
the first of 350 lappers
of the day.

01:19:06.808 --> 01:19:09.511
And all the action is at
the back of
the pack, right now.

01:19:09.511 --> 01:19:12.114
Number 8, Rick Daniels,
is currently in 10th.

01:19:12.114 --> 01:19:15.183
Remember, only the top 10
positions in the next two races
will make it to the

01:19:15.684 --> 01:19:18.086
Fifty thousand dollar
dash for cash.

01:19:18.086 --> 01:19:21.223
Oh, Lucas slams the
door on the 300.

01:19:21.223 --> 01:19:25.627
Oh, the 300 takes
the low line at turns three,
and gets around Lucas.

01:19:25.627 --> 01:19:28.697
Whoo!

01:19:33.668 --> 01:19:36.738
He started dead last,
but he's been
taking down cars left and right.

01:19:37.105 --> 01:19:38.740
Go!

01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:40.642
Who's drivin' that car?

01:19:40.642 --> 01:19:42.310
It's Jeremy Williams.

01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:45.380
Who's Jeremy Williams?

01:19:46.481 --> 01:19:49.551
Whoa! We got a reck out there!

01:19:49.851 --> 01:19:51.686
The caution flag is out!

01:19:51.686 --> 01:19:54.756
The cars slid to the inside!
Slow down
and go high and turn three.

01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:57.726
Okay, got it. Slowin' and goin'.

01:19:57.726 --> 01:19:59.761
All right, that puts
you in eleventh.

01:19:59.761 --> 01:20:02.831
Let's get 'em lined up and see
how this race turns
out from here.

01:20:04.566 --> 01:20:06.334
Cars are coming to
a complete stop now

01:20:06.334 --> 01:20:08.336
as the debris clears the track.

01:20:08.336 --> 01:20:10.705
- Do you want a drink?
- No, thank you,

01:20:10.705 --> 01:20:12.073
Okay.

01:20:12.073 --> 01:20:13.175
All right, let's see
what you got!

01:20:13.175 --> 01:20:17.112
Cars on the move,
again, under caution, now.

01:20:17.112 --> 01:20:17.846
Come on!

01:20:17.846 --> 01:20:20.682
And the green flag
drops, it's game on!

01:20:25.353 --> 01:20:28.690
Jeremy Williamson on the
high line, pulls close,

01:20:28.690 --> 01:20:30.492
but can't over take Brick.

01:20:31.793 --> 01:20:34.296
Pass him! Whoo!

01:20:34.296 --> 01:20:38.133
I got you. Okay. All right.
I got you. I got you!

01:20:38.133 --> 01:20:42.204
Williamson, getting
pressure from Beau Lucas,

01:20:42.204 --> 01:20:44.039
but now it's his
turn to slam the door.

01:20:44.039 --> 01:20:44.773
- Come on!

01:20:44.773 --> 01:20:46.641
- You're not gonna
take this one, Rick!

01:20:46.641 --> 01:20:49.344
Jeremy passes odds
on that 10 spot.

01:20:49.344 --> 01:20:51.746
Now, Brick sideswipes Jeremy!

01:20:53.181 --> 01:20:56.117
Williamson gives it
right back! Good for him!

01:21:01.890 --> 01:21:03.325
Jeremy Williamson,
on the high line!

01:21:04.259 --> 01:21:06.962
- And over takes Bricks
number 8.

01:21:06.962 --> 01:21:08.129
- Whoo! Yes!

01:21:10.799 --> 01:21:13.368
Looks like team Williamson gonna
make it to the
Dash for the Cash.

01:21:15.070 --> 01:21:17.372
Oh! Hit by a brick!

01:21:17.372 --> 01:21:18.807
What was he thinking?

01:21:18.807 --> 01:21:24.312
- Folks, that is just uncalled
for. That is an amateur move.

01:21:24.312 --> 01:21:27.215
You don't expect that,
and you hate to see it,

01:21:27.215 --> 01:21:30.252
Now, Jeremy Williamson still
finishes in 10th place

01:21:30.252 --> 01:21:31.820
so he'll be passed on
to the final,

01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:34.990
but his pit crew is gonna be
busy for the next two hours.

01:21:34.990 --> 01:21:38.493
Jeremy Williamson, a man
on a mission here today.

01:21:38.493 --> 01:21:41.229
- All right, Charlie. What's
it look like under there?

01:21:41.229 --> 01:21:44.032
- Well, at first glance, the
rear end it toast.

01:21:48.036 --> 01:21:49.905
- Hey.
- Wassup, bro?

01:21:50.438 --> 01:21:52.607
- Hey, Will. We have an hour
and a half to fix this,
all right?

01:21:52.607 --> 01:21:54.209
You beat him, let it go.

01:21:54.209 --> 01:21:56.678
- All right, Derwin, Tom. Come
with me, let's see what we

01:21:56.678 --> 01:21:58.013
can salvage out of my truck.

01:21:58.013 --> 01:21:59.014
- Let's make this happen.

01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:42.157
The sun has set,
here at Friendship Speedway,

01:22:42.157 --> 01:22:45.527
we are ready for the main event,
just about 10 minutes from now.

01:22:45.527 --> 01:22:47.529
We will go for the
Dash for the Cash.

01:22:47.529 --> 01:22:49.564
And everybody wants to know
who's going to win this thing.

01:22:49.564 --> 01:22:51.199
The heavy favorite,
Conrad Bank?

01:22:51.199 --> 01:22:54.235
Or the young up star, perhaps,
Jeremy Williamson?

01:22:56.972 --> 01:23:00.041
Jerry Shifter, please
report to the tech shift.

01:23:00.976 --> 01:23:01.743
- Having trouble?

01:23:02.877 --> 01:23:05.113
- Nah.
- Hmm?

01:23:05.113 --> 01:23:07.282
Just stopped by to
see if you're doin' okay.

01:23:07.282 --> 01:23:08.583
- Right.
- Yeah.

01:23:08.583 --> 01:23:11.820
Yeah, we're fine.
Why don't you get outa here?

01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:15.523
Look, son. You did a decent job
with the amateurs.

01:23:15.523 --> 01:23:19.861
But you're about to step off the
porch with the big dogs
this race.

01:23:19.861 --> 01:23:22.297
- Kiss my grits!

01:23:23.098 --> 01:23:25.633
- Did you say "kiss my grits"?
- Yeah, I did.

01:23:25.633 --> 01:23:29.904
I don't know
why I bother.

01:23:29.904 --> 01:23:32.807
- He don't like grits, or
somethin'?

01:23:32.807 --> 01:23:34.109
- He did that better
than me.

01:23:35.243 --> 01:23:38.780
- Drivers suiting up with fifty
thousand dollars on the line.

01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:42.017
A purse this big has attracted
drivers from all over
the country.

01:23:42.017 --> 01:23:45.320
Thirty drivers remain, all
foaming at the mouth
for the win.

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:49.424
If you're gonna get a hot dog,
do it now, because the flag is
about to drop.

01:23:49.424 --> 01:23:51.159
- How's it look,
is she gonna hold?

01:23:51.159 --> 01:23:54.562
- I did everything short of
using gum and duct tape

01:23:54.562 --> 01:23:56.831
but, I think she's got
another one left in her.

01:23:56.831 --> 01:23:59.401
- Good, how you guys
lookin', good?

01:23:59.401 --> 01:24:01.603
Good? How you lookin', Derwin?

01:24:03.872 --> 01:24:05.173
- Where the nuts?

01:24:05.173 --> 01:24:06.975
- We missin' two nuts, man.
- We don't have any extras?

01:24:06.975 --> 01:24:09.210
No, we don't have any extras,
man, it's too much pressure on

01:24:09.210 --> 01:24:11.713
this tire to run on only three,
not through the whole darn race.

01:24:11.713 --> 01:24:14.115
- We aint got no extras, man.
- What is it?

01:24:14.115 --> 01:24:15.717
- I'm missing two nuts.
- Lug nuts?

01:24:15.717 --> 01:24:17.519
- Yeah, I'm missin'
two of 'em.

01:24:19.387 --> 01:24:22.657
Drivers for A-Main.
10 minutes 'til start.

01:24:22.657 --> 01:24:24.726
Drivers, report to the line.

01:24:30.198 --> 01:24:31.032
- Oh, wait!

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.802
Will this one work?

01:24:36.371 --> 01:24:38.540
- Yeah, that'll work. Yes.

01:24:42.577 --> 01:24:45.346
Conrad Baine's had a
little trouble in qualifying

01:24:45.346 --> 01:24:47.115
and is starting deep
in the pack.

01:24:47.115 --> 01:24:49.050
I've seen him win
in worse positions, though.

01:24:49.050 --> 01:24:52.320
So he is a very dangerous
adversary, even still.

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:54.689
Jesse came from Pennsylvania,
Mark Luft is from Florida,

01:24:54.689 --> 01:24:57.625
Landon Baker from Texas,
Terry Shifter from New Mexico,

01:24:57.625 --> 01:25:00.995
and John Logan from Iowa,
round out the top five.

01:25:00.995 --> 01:25:04.265
There's the four car salute, now
let's get these cars line up.

01:25:04.265 --> 01:25:05.433
The fans are pumped up!

01:25:10.138 --> 01:25:13.274
Five time winner, Conrad Baines,
and Clift Williamson

01:25:13.274 --> 01:25:15.977
were not very fond
of each other.

01:25:15.977 --> 01:25:20.115
Turns out the 300, Jeremy
Williamson, is Clift's grandson.

01:25:20.115 --> 01:25:22.917
I smell blood on
the tracks tonight, folks,

01:25:25.787 --> 01:25:27.388
And there's the green!

01:25:34.729 --> 01:25:37.732
Baker, Shifter and Logan
all buying for third.

01:25:47.108 --> 01:25:50.245
Jeff, Williams, and the number 7
moves up from 14 to 11.

01:25:50.245 --> 01:25:51.312
What a mount!

01:26:09.564 --> 01:26:12.767
Lucy Wagner, our only female
driver here tonight from Kansas,

01:26:12.767 --> 01:26:14.536
moves up from tenth to eighth.

01:26:17.172 --> 01:26:21.075
Oh, the cars get wadded up
into turn two and the caution

01:26:21.075 --> 01:26:21.910
flag comes out!

01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:25.113
- There's a reck at turn two,
son. Go high. Go high!

01:26:25.113 --> 01:26:25.947
- Got it!

01:26:28.583 --> 01:26:30.518
Looks like at least
two of 'em are gonna be out of
this race.

01:26:32.453 --> 01:26:36.124
Cars lined back under caution as
Wayne Mans knotted up Number 19

01:26:36.124 --> 01:26:38.159
gets towed off the track.

01:26:39.093 --> 01:26:40.862
And the race is back underway.

01:26:43.698 --> 01:26:45.533
Logan moves up to third,
putting pressure on Caine,

01:26:45.533 --> 01:26:48.636
now in second. Luft is just
trying to open up a lead.

01:26:48.636 --> 01:26:50.471
Caine is not letting
that happen.

01:26:50.471 --> 01:26:51.973
- How's she feelin'?

01:26:51.973 --> 01:26:54.042
- She feels good,
I'm gonna push her.

01:27:01.115 --> 01:27:02.450
- How far back am I?

01:27:02.450 --> 01:27:04.419
- You're sitting at twenty.

01:27:04.419 --> 01:27:07.655
Conrad is looking
lethal tonight, making big moves

01:27:07.655 --> 01:27:08.756
up the pack.

01:27:08.756 --> 01:27:11.659
Jeremy Williamson gets
around 33 and 115.

01:27:11.659 --> 01:27:15.029
Caine, dropping back three more
spots, not a good night for him.

01:27:17.832 --> 01:27:18.666
- Ease back.

01:27:20.535 --> 01:27:23.638
Williamson gets
around Conrad, mid-pack.

01:27:27.475 --> 01:27:29.544
Duncan's number one
loses control,

01:27:29.544 --> 01:27:33.348
The 17, 41, 22 and 57
all tangled up.

01:27:33.348 --> 01:27:35.116
And the caution is out.

01:27:36.784 --> 01:27:38.519
- You all right?
- I'm all right!

01:27:41.122 --> 01:27:43.424
It won't go in reverse,
it's stuck!

01:27:44.859 --> 01:27:48.296
Wait, no, I got it! I got it!
We're good! We're good!

01:27:49.964 --> 01:27:53.201
Twenty-five laps
into the dash, John Logan,
from Iowa,

01:27:53.201 --> 01:27:56.304
has taken the lead. Landen Baker
in second. Conrad Baine's is

01:27:56.304 --> 01:27:59.707
right on his tail. Do not
underestimate Baines.

01:28:02.243 --> 01:28:04.746
- Doin' great, son. You're
doing great! Keep it up!

01:28:07.582 --> 01:28:10.718
You just grabbed fifteenth
place. You're doin' great!

01:28:11.219 --> 01:28:14.522
Conrad Baine takes
the lead!

01:28:14.522 --> 01:28:17.025
Williamson moves up
six more spots.

01:28:19.794 --> 01:28:23.498
- That's fourth.
[announcer] This rookie is
rockin'!

01:28:23.498 --> 01:28:25.533
- I'm comin' for
you, Conrad!

01:28:36.444 --> 01:28:39.947
 Williamson gets
around veterans Logan and Baker!

01:29:06.841 --> 01:29:07.675
Ohh!

01:29:10.578 --> 01:29:11.412
- Yeah!

01:29:25.393 --> 01:29:26.828
- Go! Go!

01:29:31.833 --> 01:29:34.736
- I want you to go high
in the next turn.

01:29:34.736 --> 01:29:37.905
- What, I can't, when Dad did
that, he flippe-

01:29:37.905 --> 01:29:40.975
- Never mind that, I'm
telling you to go high!

01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:43.945
When you get to the
top of the curve,

01:29:43.945 --> 01:29:46.481
yank it hard to the
inside, and floor it!

01:29:46.481 --> 01:29:48.416
- Here goes nothing!

01:29:56.057 --> 01:29:57.959
- I'm losing power!

01:29:57.959 --> 01:30:00.027
Conrad Baines and
Jeremy Williamson come to the

01:30:00.027 --> 01:30:01.462
finish line.
They're neck and neck!

01:30:01.462 --> 01:30:07.068
And ohh! Jeremy
Williamson was robbed!

01:30:07.068 --> 01:30:07.902
- What?

01:30:21.416 --> 01:30:22.250
Hey!

01:30:24.085 --> 01:30:26.220
Check this out! [laughs]

01:30:28.222 --> 01:30:29.190
Huh?

01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:31.726
I'm gonna have to
find a bigger bank!

01:30:31.726 --> 01:30:35.296
What, do you think that'll
buy me a lot of grits?

01:30:44.439 --> 01:30:46.874
- I had him, Dad.

01:30:46.874 --> 01:30:48.309
I had him!

01:30:50.812 --> 01:30:52.947
- All right, I'm gonna go
pull the car around, all right?

01:31:00.788 --> 01:31:01.622
- Let's go.

01:31:19.740 --> 01:31:23.144
- Well, we'll figure it out.

01:31:23.144 --> 01:31:28.115
- I'm gonna go talk
to Stephanie, okay?

01:31:28.115 --> 01:31:28.950
Sorry, babe.

01:31:50.338 --> 01:31:51.806
- Nice show of force, huh?

01:31:56.043 --> 01:31:58.179
Auction's not for
another thirty minutes.

01:32:08.456 --> 01:32:10.925
- Tom, we're just gonna finish
cleaning up the tools, okay?

01:32:31.479 --> 01:32:32.580
- Here's your final pay checks.

01:32:35.950 --> 01:32:39.220
- You know we really don't-
- No, I insist. I insist.

01:32:40.521 --> 01:32:43.958
Take them. Take them.

01:32:46.661 --> 01:32:50.665
Thank you for stickin' around
and helping us close down,

01:32:50.665 --> 01:32:53.200
This gave me a place
to do my thing, man.

01:32:54.936 --> 01:32:55.770
- Thank you.

01:33:04.345 --> 01:33:07.782
- Thank you.
- [grunts]

01:33:34.375 --> 01:33:35.209
- Hank.

01:33:39.747 --> 01:33:41.182
I want you to have
the bench, okay?

01:33:48.823 --> 01:33:50.224
- Honey, I need you
to finish up with that.

01:33:50.224 --> 01:33:52.994
I need you to help me pack up
all this stuff, and this.

01:33:52.994 --> 01:33:54.729
- I just want to print
a few more.

01:33:54.729 --> 01:33:56.731
- Hold on, go back,

01:34:06.874 --> 01:34:10.978
- What, really? Right now?
Do we have to do that right now?

01:34:10.978 --> 01:34:13.180
- Just, their about to kno-
- Honey, look at it.

01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:16.384
- Dad, just look at
the picture.

01:34:21.288 --> 01:34:23.090
- What is it?
- Is that what-

01:34:23.090 --> 01:34:23.924
- What is it?

01:34:27.261 --> 01:34:29.330
Huh, it's-

01:34:31.666 --> 01:34:33.534
- That means I won!
[laughs]

01:34:33.534 --> 01:34:37.038
Ohh, I gotta show this
to the race officials right now!

01:34:37.038 --> 01:34:39.674
- Stephany, you are the best
[kiss] photographer ever.

01:34:39.674 --> 01:34:41.375
I love you. Yes!

01:34:41.375 --> 01:34:43.978
- Goin' once. Goin' twice.
Sold, to the lady in the back.

01:34:43.978 --> 01:34:46.347
You got a beautiful
deal there, darlin'.

01:34:46.347 --> 01:34:47.682
Next item up for bid,

01:34:47.682 --> 01:34:50.451
ladies and gentlemen, we got a
beautiful piece of property

01:34:50.451 --> 01:34:53.521
at 3525 Big Lawny Way.

01:34:53.521 --> 01:34:55.289
Who give me 90 thousand, 90k?

01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:05.700
I got 90 right here.
Give me 90k.

01:35:05.700 --> 01:35:07.401
- Stop! Wait!

01:35:07.401 --> 01:35:09.236
- Hey sir, I'm trying to
do something here!

01:35:09.236 --> 01:35:11.372
- I know, stop!

01:35:12.306 --> 01:35:14.575
- What are you doin' here?
- I'm here to claim my property,

01:35:14.575 --> 01:35:16.544
Conrad. You're busted.

01:35:16.544 --> 01:35:18.145
- What are you talkin' about?

01:35:18.145 --> 01:35:20.247
- I happen to have a picture
of you, right here,

01:35:20.247 --> 01:35:23.984
paying off Brick, to wreck us,
sabotaging the race!

01:35:23.984 --> 01:35:25.653
The race commissioner has
been sent a copy of this,

01:35:25.653 --> 01:35:28.622
and you have been
officially disqualified!

01:35:28.622 --> 01:35:30.391
We win!

01:35:31.592 --> 01:35:35.296
- Huh, lemme see that.

01:35:35.296 --> 01:35:38.466
Oh, sure. I'm gonna cut you
a check for your winnings,

01:35:38.466 --> 01:35:41.769
just as soon as I make it back
to my office, is that okay?

01:35:41.769 --> 01:35:43.537
- Doggon right.

01:35:43.537 --> 01:35:45.439
- But first I'm gonna
win this auction.

01:35:45.439 --> 01:35:47.208
Now, if there's nothing else,

01:35:47.208 --> 01:35:49.777
I have some business
to take care of.

01:35:49.777 --> 01:35:51.979
Oh, unless you've brought
enough money

01:35:51.979 --> 01:35:53.080
to settle your debt?

01:35:55.816 --> 01:35:56.884
I didn't think so.

01:35:56.884 --> 01:35:57.718
Go.

01:35:58.119 --> 01:35:58.886
- Eh, and the bid
goin' twice!

01:35:58.886 --> 01:36:00.788
- Not so fast!

01:36:00.788 --> 01:36:04.492
You no good, money grubbin'
whippersnapper.

01:36:04.492 --> 01:36:07.228
I thought-I thought I
taught you better than that.

01:36:07.228 --> 01:36:09.196
- Look, Dad-
- Well, don't you give that

01:36:09.196 --> 01:36:13.334
"Dad" stuff. I gave you enough
money so you can keep on doing

01:36:13.334 --> 01:36:16.737
whatever you want.
But it was my money!

01:36:16.737 --> 01:36:21.108
And I don't want it used for
no deceitful purposes.

01:36:21.108 --> 01:36:23.210
Especially if the best you can

01:36:23.210 --> 01:36:26.680
is tear down the gasoline
station, the first one I that

01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:31.018
I ever had! I don't want
nothing to do with it.

01:36:31.018 --> 01:36:34.855
And if he hadn't crashed,
you-you'd be history.

01:36:40.494 --> 01:36:43.864
Consider the debt paid!

01:36:43.864 --> 01:36:44.965
- Wha-what?

01:36:46.634 --> 01:36:47.635
What?

01:36:47.635 --> 01:36:49.703
- Thank you so much.
[laughs]

01:36:51.005 --> 01:36:53.908
- Oh, my gosh.
Thank you, Hank.

01:36:55.176 --> 01:36:56.010
You're an angel.

01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:02.583
- Congratulations, Tom.
You know I've always liked you.

01:37:03.517 --> 01:37:05.686
What do you say you come over to
my office on Wednesday

01:37:05.686 --> 01:37:07.655
we kick around some number, and
try and work out a deal.

01:37:09.924 --> 01:37:12.760
- Yeah, I don't think so.
I have a service station to run,

01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:14.562
but, I sure do appreciate
it, Mr. Jacobs.

01:37:18.833 --> 01:37:21.135
- Hey, uhh, Jenkins.

01:37:21.135 --> 01:37:23.904
I got nine acres over by
the chicken farm.

01:37:23.904 --> 01:37:26.974
- Yeah, Conrad. I don't think
there's a deal here to be made.

01:37:26.974 --> 01:37:28.776
- No deal, huh?

01:37:29.443 --> 01:37:31.545
- Say cheese!
- Huh?

01:37:32.179 --> 01:37:33.614
- I know he does.

01:37:39.019 --> 01:37:40.921
- Yes, yes.

01:37:40.921 --> 01:37:44.058
Uhm, your applications
came back in the mail.

01:37:44.058 --> 01:37:47.428
I couldn't stand it. I opened
'em all, and you got into

01:37:47.428 --> 01:37:48.963
every of them. [laugh]

01:37:48.963 --> 01:37:51.332
You can go wherever you want.

01:37:51.332 --> 01:37:54.668
- Wow! Uhm...

01:37:54.668 --> 01:37:58.839
You know what, I think I still
wanna go to community college.

01:37:58.839 --> 01:37:59.874
Take the mechanics program.

01:38:02.243 --> 01:38:04.311
- Okay.

01:38:04.311 --> 01:38:09.383
Well, here I want you
to have this.

01:38:12.453 --> 01:38:14.221
- Wow. Thanks.

01:38:16.523 --> 01:38:18.525
- I love you, man.

01:38:18.525 --> 01:38:20.961
