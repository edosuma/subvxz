WEBVTT

00:02.770 --> 00:06.474
(Mindy)
SO I GUESS ALL MY PROBLEMS
HAVE BEEN SOLVED FOREVER.

00:08.442 --> 00:11.279
AFTER YEARS AS A HIGH-PROFILE
DOCTOR IN MANHATTAN,

00:11.312 --> 00:14.115
THIS SUMMER, I GAVE IT ALL UP
TO MOVE TO HAITI.

00:14.148 --> 00:17.451
[rhythmic world music]

00:17.485 --> 00:19.620
HAITI'S NOT SO DIFFERENT
FROM NEW YORK,

00:19.653 --> 00:21.389
EXCEPT NOT AS MANY PEOPLE
SCREAM AT YOU,

00:21.422 --> 00:23.691
AND IT SMELLS BETTER.

00:23.724 --> 00:25.826
THE BEST PART IS THAT I'M HERE
WITH MY AMAZING BOYFRIEND.

00:25.859 --> 00:28.229
HE'S A MAN OF GOD,
NO BIG DEAL.

00:28.262 --> 00:31.199
WE LIVE TOGETHER,
WE SHOP TOGETHER.

00:31.232 --> 00:32.466
WE EVEN CARPOOL
TO WORK TOGETHER.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.302
WE'RE BASICALLY
AN OLD MARRIED COUPLE,

00:34.335 --> 00:36.337
EXCEPT WE'RE YOUNG AND HOT.

00:36.370 --> 00:39.373
OH! I BOUGHT STATIONERY
THAT HAS MY NAME ON IT,

00:39.407 --> 00:41.542
AND I CORRESPOND WITH PEOPLE.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.577
I'VE BEEN ABLE TO KEEP
CLOSE TABS ON MY LIFE BACK HOME,

00:43.611 --> 00:46.414
THANKS TO AN OLD FORM OF EMAIL
CALLED "MAIL."

00:46.447 --> 00:49.183
MORGAN'S BEEN SENDING ME
THOUGHTFUL CARE PACKAGES,

00:49.217 --> 00:52.820
BUT I THINK SOMEONE'S BEEN
STEALING MY PEANUT BUTTER CUPS.

00:52.853 --> 00:54.455
*

00:54.488 --> 00:57.125
I FEEL A LITTLE GUILTY ABOUT
LEAVING MY JOB.

00:57.158 --> 01:00.161
I JUST HOPE THE PRACTICE
DOESN'T FALL APART WITHOUT ME.

01:02.863 --> 01:05.666
[applause]

01:05.699 --> 01:07.535
I GUESS DANNY'S TOO BUSY
ENJOYING HIS SECOND HONEYMOON

01:07.568 --> 01:09.470
TO KEEP ME UP ON MY TV SHOWS.

01:09.503 --> 01:11.105
BUT THAT'S OKAY.

01:11.139 --> 01:13.241
WE'VE GOTTEN ADDICTED
TO HAITI'S BIGGEST REALITY HIT,

01:13.274 --> 01:15.576
THE REAL HOUSEFLIES OF
PORT-AU-PRINCE.

01:15.609 --> 01:17.345
*

01:17.378 --> 01:20.181
I GUESS IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT
I DON'T MISS NEW YORK AT ALL.

01:20.214 --> 01:22.416
EVERYTHING'S GREAT.

01:22.450 --> 01:25.286
EXCEPT WHEN MY BOYFRIEND
WAKES ME UP AT 5:00 A.M.

01:25.319 --> 01:27.188
TO SEE THE HAITIAN SUNRISE.

01:27.221 --> 01:28.256
LOOK AT YOU.

01:28.289 --> 01:29.457
IF, SIX MONTHS AGO,
I'D SAID,

01:29.490 --> 01:30.658
"HEY, LET'S
CLIMB A TREE

01:30.691 --> 01:33.361
AND CHECK OUT
THIS BEAUTIFUL-ASS SUNRISE,"

01:33.394 --> 01:36.397
YOU'D PUNCH ME
IN THE CROTCH, RIGHT?

01:36.430 --> 01:37.631
I'M NOT HAPPY
ABOUT IT NOW.

01:37.665 --> 01:40.268
BUT...
YOU BARELY HATE IT.

01:40.301 --> 01:41.602
YEAH, I MEAN, IT LOOKS--
RIGHT?

01:41.635 --> 01:43.204
IT LOOKS
LIKE A DOUCHE AD.

01:43.237 --> 01:47.408
NOT EXACTLY THE BEST SEGUE
I WAS LOOKING FOR.

01:47.441 --> 01:48.876
THERE'S ANTS
ON THIS.

01:48.909 --> 01:50.644
MINDY...

01:50.678 --> 01:51.645
[gasps]

01:51.679 --> 01:53.247
STOP.
LISTEN.

01:53.281 --> 01:54.248
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

01:54.282 --> 01:55.716
NO. HEY.

01:55.749 --> 01:56.884
I WANNA VINE THIS.

01:56.917 --> 01:58.719
I--PEOPLE SHOULD--
OKAY.

01:58.752 --> 02:00.688
MINDY, WHEN I FIRST
MET YOU, I THOUGHT,

02:00.721 --> 02:01.822
"THIS IS PROBABLY GONNA BE
A FLING," YOU KNOW,

02:01.855 --> 02:02.890
BASED ON YOUR
BODY TYPE ALONE.

02:02.923 --> 02:05.226
BUT I THOUGHT IT'D BE
A FUN LITTLE DETOUR, YOU KNOW.

02:05.259 --> 02:06.160
"WE'LL GO OFF-ROADIN',

02:06.194 --> 02:08.562
JUST HEAD UP THE DUNE
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS."

02:08.596 --> 02:11.932
BUT IT WASN'T A DETOUR.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.201
THIS WAS MY PATH.

02:13.234 --> 02:14.535
I LOVE YOU.

02:14.568 --> 02:16.270
MINDY LAHIRI,
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

02:16.304 --> 02:17.938
YES! YES, YES, YES!
CAN I--CAN I?

02:17.971 --> 02:19.340
PUT IT ON...

02:19.373 --> 02:20.474
'CAUSE I SEE
A LADY IN THIS TREE

02:20.508 --> 02:22.343
THAT SHOULD BE
HAVING MY BABY.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.279
MM! MM!
WHOA, OH!

02:25.313 --> 02:26.680
[thud]
(Mindy)
OH, GOD.

02:26.714 --> 02:29.383
(Casey)
IT IS SO HOT THAT
YOU'RE GONNA BE MY WIFE.

02:29.417 --> 02:30.851
BUT LET ME WARN YOU.
MM-HMM?

02:30.884 --> 02:32.786
MY FAMILY HAS A LOT
OF HEART DISEASE.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.288
YEAH?

02:34.322 --> 02:36.324
I COULD DIE WHILE WE'RE
DOIN' IT OR SOMETHING.

02:36.357 --> 02:38.526
MM--OW! OH, GOD.
WHAT'S UP?

02:38.559 --> 02:40.628
WHAT IS IT?
OH, MY GOD.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.330
OH, IT'S MY STOMACH.
MINDY...

02:42.363 --> 02:43.497
HEY, COME ON,
FIVE MINUTES.

02:43.531 --> 02:45.199
FIVE--
OKAY, JUST TWO.

02:45.233 --> 02:46.200
ALL I NEED IS TWO.

02:46.234 --> 02:47.368
I CAN TAKE CARE
OF EVERYTHING.

02:47.401 --> 02:48.569
YEAH, YEAH, OKAY,
AND I'M HORNY, TOO,

02:48.602 --> 02:49.737
'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA
BE MY HUSBAND.

02:49.770 --> 02:51.339
MM! OH, GOD!
WHAT?

02:51.372 --> 02:52.506
OH, I'M CLOSE, TOO.
DAMN IT, NO--

02:52.540 --> 02:53.774
NO, OW!
WHAT?

02:53.807 --> 02:55.343
[pained groan]
MINDY...

02:55.376 --> 02:57.578
COME ON.
HEY, HEY, MINDY?

02:57.611 --> 03:00.414
MINDY...
MINDY...

03:00.448 --> 03:02.950
HI.

03:02.983 --> 03:03.984
HI.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.253
[screams]

03:05.286 --> 03:06.687
OH, OH, G--
OH, SHH, QUIET!

03:06.720 --> 03:08.356
QUIET, NO, NO, NO, NO.
QUIET! STOP, STOP!

03:08.389 --> 03:09.957
OH, W-WE'RE FINE!

03:09.990 --> 03:13.193
[upbeat music]

03:25.706 --> 03:26.874
SHH, MM, QUIET,
QUIET, QUIET, QUIET.

03:26.907 --> 03:28.776
I'VE BEEN SNOW WHITE-ING
YOU FOR THE PAST HOUR.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.811
SHH.
YOU ALL GOOD?

03:30.844 --> 03:32.680
THERE YOU GO.
WHERE AM I?

03:32.713 --> 03:34.748
YOU'RE IN
NEW YORK CITY!

03:34.782 --> 03:35.583
GOT AIRLIFTED
OUT OF HAITI

03:35.616 --> 03:38.819
TO HAVE EMERGENCY
GALLBLADDER SURGERY.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.788
OKAY, THAT MAKES SENSE.
YEAH.

03:40.821 --> 03:42.456
WHAT DID YOU BRING ME
FROM HAITI?

03:42.490 --> 03:44.725
[sighs]
I BROUGHT YOU NOTHING.

03:44.758 --> 03:46.760
OKAY, WELL, I'M GONNA
ORDER SOMETHING ONLINE,

03:46.794 --> 03:47.995
AND MAYBE YOU CAN
REIMBURSE ME?

03:48.028 --> 03:50.298
NO. NO.
TELL ME HOW MUCH
I CAN SPEND.

03:50.331 --> 03:51.732
150? $200?
NO. NO, NO, NO, NO.

03:51.765 --> 03:52.800
I'M NOT--I'M NOT GONNA
BUY YOU ANYTHING, NO--

03:52.833 --> 03:54.402
SHH, SHH, SHH.
I'M NOT GON--I'M NOT--

03:54.435 --> 03:56.670
[muffled protests]
CAN WE GET
SOME JELL-O IN HERE?

03:56.704 --> 03:58.839
YOU WANT SOMETHING?

03:58.872 --> 04:01.675
(Paul)
I WANNA DO A LITTLE EXERCISE.

04:01.709 --> 04:03.377
I WANT YOU TO TELL US

04:03.411 --> 04:07.315
FIVE THINGS YOU FIND BEAUTIFUL
ABOUT YOUR PENIS.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.583
HEY, YOU GUYS MIND
IF I GO KILL MYSELF?

04:09.617 --> 04:10.718
DANNY, THIS IS
SEX THERAPY.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.520
WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO TALK ABOUT SEX.

04:12.553 --> 04:14.054
OR, IN OUR CASE,
LACK THEREOF.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.757
OKAY, OKAY, WE--THAT'S
PRIVATE BETWEEN ME AND YOU.

04:16.790 --> 04:19.593
DANNY, DANNY, DANNY...
WHAT?

04:19.627 --> 04:21.429
NOW, THIS ISN'T GONNA WORK
UNLESS YOU'RE OPEN.

04:21.462 --> 04:24.732
FOR EXAMPLE,
CHRISTINA'S EROTIC JOURNAL

04:24.765 --> 04:27.901
WAS COMPREHENSIVE,
SUSPENSEFUL,

04:27.935 --> 04:30.471
AND, FRANKLY, MOVING.
THANK YOU.

04:30.504 --> 04:31.572
WHILE YOURS,
ON THE OTHER HAND,

04:31.605 --> 04:35.309
WAS JUST A RANT
ABOUT AIRPORT SECURITY

04:35.343 --> 04:37.911
AND A TRICK PLAY
FOR THE JETS.

04:37.945 --> 04:41.415
NOW, LET'S TALK
ABOUT YOUR SPERM.

04:41.449 --> 04:42.783
[aggravated sigh]

04:42.816 --> 04:43.951
NOTICE THEIR BEHAVIOR.

04:43.984 --> 04:46.454
THEY'RE LISTLESS.
THEY'RE UNHAPPY.

04:46.487 --> 04:48.989
THEY'RE APATHETIC.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.858
BUT THEY ARE
PERFECTLY HEALTHY.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.693
THEN WHY'D YOU SAY
ALL THAT OTHER STUFF FIRST?

04:52.726 --> 04:53.994
JUST THE WAY I TALK.

04:54.027 --> 04:55.729
NOW, I TOOK THE LIBERTY

04:55.763 --> 04:57.931
OF PUTTING MY OWN SPERM
ON A SLIDE

04:57.965 --> 05:00.834
FOR MEANS OF COMPARISON.

05:00.868 --> 05:03.937
[funky music]
MM! MM-MM!

05:03.971 --> 05:05.906
CHECK 'EM OUT.

05:05.939 --> 05:07.841
GOT ATTITUDE.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.410
THEY'RE LIKE KIDS

05:09.443 --> 05:12.346
PLAYING IN AN OPEN
FIRE HYDRANT IN THE '70S.

05:12.380 --> 05:13.213
THANK YOU, PAUL.
PUT IT AWAY.

05:13.246 --> 05:17.485
SO HOW DO WE GET
YOUR SPERM MORE EXCITED?

05:17.518 --> 05:20.120
EH...
DANNY'S NOT
VERY ADVENTUROUS.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.822
HE REALLY LIKES
TO DO IT MISSIONARY.

05:21.855 --> 05:24.692
MISSIONARIES ARE
EXTREMELY ADVENTUROUS.

05:24.725 --> 05:27.661
YOU KNOW WHO ELSE
IS ADVENTUROUS?

05:27.695 --> 05:30.664
COWGIRLS.
REVERSE COWGIRLS.

05:30.698 --> 05:31.765
OKAY.

05:31.799 --> 05:33.601
THE NEXT TIME
EITHER ONE OF YOU

05:33.634 --> 05:34.735
IS IN THE MOOD,

05:34.768 --> 05:37.070
I WANT YOU
TO POP IN THIS CD.

05:37.104 --> 05:38.872
I'VE HAD A LOT
OF LUCK WITH IT.

05:38.906 --> 05:42.009
IT WON A GRAMMY.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.848
WHAT? STOP EATING
CHEESE FOR A SECOND.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.483
YOU LOOK REALLY DIFFERENT.
THANK YOU.

05:49.517 --> 05:50.484
I'M GLAD
SOMEBODY NOTICED.

05:50.518 --> 05:51.819
YEAH, I GOT
MY TEETH WHITENED.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.887
I MEAN, IT BLOODY HURT,
ACTUALLY,

05:53.921 --> 05:54.888
BUT THEY LOOK FANTASTIC.

05:54.922 --> 05:56.624
YEAH, SHE'S NOT TALKING
ABOUT YOUR TEETH, BUDDY.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.025
SHE'S TALKING
ABOUT YOUR FAT.

05:58.058 --> 06:00.528
I AM.
I AM TALKING ABOUT THAT.

06:01.795 --> 06:05.566
SINCE YOU ABANDONED US
FOR HAITI,

06:05.599 --> 06:07.768
AND DANNY WENT TO JERSEY,
WHEREVER THAT IS,

06:07.801 --> 06:10.170
I WAS FORCED TO ASSUME
THE ROLE OF MANAGING PARTNER.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.171
NOW, IN TIMES
OF EXTREME STRESS,

06:11.204 --> 06:12.172
I TURN TO FOOD.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.575
WHEN I DID MY "A" LEVELS,

06:14.608 --> 06:15.876
I WAS THE SIZE
OF A SMALL SKI CHALET.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.044
IS THAT UNFORGIVABLE?

06:17.077 --> 06:18.746
WHY DON'T YOU
LEAVE HIM ALONE?

06:18.779 --> 06:20.080
HE'S A HUMAN BEING
WITH FEELINGS.

06:20.113 --> 06:21.882
OKAY.

06:21.915 --> 06:23.517
WANT TO SEE IF HIS FATNESS
CAN HOLD THIS PEN?

06:23.551 --> 06:25.786
OH, WOW,
'CAUSE YOU'RE PERFECT!

06:25.819 --> 06:27.821
AREN'T YOU?

06:36.930 --> 06:38.599
HELLO?

06:38.632 --> 06:41.702
HELLO.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.771
HEY, TAMRA,
WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

06:43.804 --> 06:44.972
DID THEY GO TO
THAT ETHNIC STREET FAIR?

06:45.005 --> 06:46.073
I TOLD THEM NOT TO GO.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.675
NO, THEY ALL WENT
TO VISIT

06:47.708 --> 06:49.209
THAT INDIAN DOCTOR
WHO USED TO WORK HERE.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.479
SHE'S REAL SICK.

06:51.512 --> 06:54.682
WHAT'S HER NAME AGAIN?
I WANNA SAY GLOB.

06:54.715 --> 06:55.749
MINDY?

06:55.783 --> 06:57.217
I REALLY THINK
IT'S GLOB.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.919
SHE'S BACK.
SHE'S SICK?

06:58.952 --> 07:00.621
I DON'T KNOW.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.799
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
WHAT DID YOU DO?

07:11.832 --> 07:13.767
WHAT'D YOU DO, GET DRUNK
AND SASS A VOODOO PRINCESS?

07:13.801 --> 07:15.503
TRY TO GET YOUR GROOVE BACK
WITH SOME STREET KID?

07:15.536 --> 07:16.604
WHAT HAPPENED?
NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO.

07:16.637 --> 07:17.805
SHE'S FINE.

07:17.838 --> 07:19.239
I JUST HAD
SOME GALLSTONES REMOVED.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.041
I'M FINE.
[relieved sigh]

07:21.074 --> 07:22.543
DID YOU RUN HERE?
NO, I JUST--

07:22.576 --> 07:25.012
YOU'RE SWEATING OUT OF
YOUR ARMPITS SO MUCH.

07:25.045 --> 07:27.715
I COULDN'T GET A CAB,
AND THEN I--

07:27.748 --> 07:29.517
SO HOW WAS THE CARIBBEAN?

07:29.550 --> 07:31.819
DID YOU LOSE
ANY WET T-SHIRT CONTESTS?

07:31.852 --> 07:34.855
OKAY, I WOULD WIN EVERY WET
T-SHIRT CONTEST I ENTERED.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.657
YEAH, BECAUSE I HAVE
HUGE KNOCKERS,

07:36.690 --> 07:38.926
AND THEY LOOK GREAT DAMP.
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.

07:38.959 --> 07:41.595
BUT I THINK YOU'RE REFERRING
TO MY CHARITY TRIP IN HAITI.

07:41.629 --> 07:44.998
DO YOU WANNA SEE PICTURES?
YEAH.

07:45.032 --> 07:46.734
THIS IS THE HOSPITAL
I BUILT IN HAITI.

07:46.767 --> 07:48.702
WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT.
ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL?

07:48.736 --> 07:50.838
WOW, I'VE NEVER SEEN
PHOTOS ON YOUR PHONE

07:50.871 --> 07:51.905
OF ANYBODY BUT YOU.

07:51.939 --> 07:54.808
HEY, YOU GUYS.
HEY!

07:54.842 --> 07:55.809
I WAS OUT GETTING SOME
OF OUR FAVORITE STUFF

07:55.843 --> 07:57.010
WE CAN'T GET IN HAITI,

07:57.044 --> 07:59.079
SO, FOR ME, A LITTLE CANDY
AND SOME BEER.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.180
AND FOR YOU...

08:00.213 --> 08:01.715
[whispers]
PRESCRIPTION DANDRUFF SHAMPOO.

08:01.749 --> 08:03.183
YES.
I GOT YOU, GIRL.

08:03.216 --> 08:05.586
YOU TELL HIM THE GOOD NEWS?
I DID NOT.

08:05.619 --> 08:09.156
GUYS, I LOST THREE POUNDS
OF WATER WEIGHT FROM DIARRHEA.

08:09.189 --> 08:11.058
OH! I KNEW
YOU LOOKED GOOD.

08:11.091 --> 08:13.927

I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE A DOCTOR.

11:28.055 --> 11:30.423
YOU COULD BE A MODEL.
ANYBODY CAN BE A DOCTOR.

11:30.457 --> 11:32.359
I ACTUALLY DID THINK
ABOUT MODELING,

11:32.392 --> 11:35.262
UNTIL I WAS SCOUTED,
AND I BECAME A MODEL.

11:35.295 --> 11:36.129
THAT'S INTERESTING.
ACTUALLY,

11:36.163 --> 11:37.330
THE SAME THING
KINDA HAPPENED TO ME.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.331
NO, IT DIDN'T,
IT DIDN'T.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.267
IF I COULD MODEL,
I WOULDN'T BE IN THIS DUMP

11:40.300 --> 11:41.468
WITH THESE LOSERS.

11:41.501 --> 11:43.070
I'D BE ON A YACHT
WITH ROBIN THICKE

11:43.103 --> 11:44.204
AND HE'D SPRAY ME
WITH CHAMPAGNE.

11:44.237 --> 11:45.305
IT JUST DIDN'T
JIBE WITH ME.

11:45.338 --> 11:46.940
THEN, ONE DAY,

11:46.974 --> 11:49.242
I WAS WALKING DOWN
THE RUNWAY SO HIGH ON "E"

11:49.276 --> 11:52.079
I ACTUALLY WALKED
OFF THE STAGE.
[gasps]

11:52.112 --> 11:53.413
I MEAN, NORMALLY,
THAT WOULD KILL A PERSON.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.015
WHAT IS IT, LIKE,
TWO FEET?

11:55.048 --> 11:56.383
HE SAID IT WOULD
KILL A PERSON.
OH, SORRY.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.385
SHUT UP.
WHEN SUDDENLY...

11:58.418 --> 12:02.322
THIS BEAUTIFUL,
GLOWING ANGEL CAUGHT ME.

12:02.355 --> 12:04.224

PREGNANT WOMAN.

I NEVER FOUND OUT
WHO SHE WAS.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.063
I KNOW SHE DID AD SALES
FOR INSTYLE.

12:10.097 --> 12:11.464
ANYWAY, FROM
THAT MOMENT ON,

12:11.498 --> 12:13.366
I REALIZED
MY LIFE'S PURPOSE:

12:13.400 --> 12:16.469
I WAS MEANT
TO GUIDE BABIES

12:16.503 --> 12:19.539
DOWN THE ORIGINAL RUNWAY,

AH, MY WEDDING DAY.

15:25.392 --> 15:27.594
THERE'S A CERTAIN CHARM
TO A SIMPLE WEDDING.

15:27.627 --> 15:30.363
NOT EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED,
BUT JUST WHAT I NEEDED.

15:30.397 --> 15:32.199
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
SOMETHING PEOPLE SAY,

15:32.232 --> 15:34.367
AND THOUGH I'M SURROUNDED
BY MY COWORKERS

15:34.401 --> 15:36.236
AND PEOPLE I FRANKLY
DON'T EVEN LIKE,

15:36.269 --> 15:37.971
ALL THAT MATTERS IS ME,

15:38.005 --> 15:40.473
MY FIANCE,
AND THE LOOK IN HIS EYES

15:40.507 --> 15:43.043
WHEN HE SEES ME FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN MY WEDDING DRESS.

15:43.076 --> 15:44.311
[urine trickling]
CASEY!

15:44.344 --> 15:45.312
OH! WHAT? OH! SH--

15:45.345 --> 15:46.179
AHH! AHH!
OH!

15:46.213 --> 15:46.946
OH, SORRY, SORRY,
SORRY, SORRY, SORRY.

15:46.980 --> 15:49.349
YOU JUST PEED ON
MY WEDDING DRESS!

15:49.382 --> 15:50.350
I AM SORRY.
YOU SCARED ME.

15:50.383 --> 15:51.084
IT SPRAYS HARDER
WHEN I'M SCARED.

15:51.118 --> 15:52.452
STOP PEEING
AND GET OUT OF HERE!

15:52.485 --> 15:53.586
NO, I CAN'T--
AND DON'T LOOK AT ME!

15:53.620 --> 15:54.721
NO, I CAN'T STOP
ONCE I'VE STARTED.

15:54.754 --> 15:56.123
I'LL DIE.
WHAT?

15:56.156 --> 15:57.424
I WILL STOP,
I'M SORRY--OKAY.
GET OUT.

15:57.457 --> 15:58.558
GET OUT, GET OUT.
I WILL DIE.

15:58.591 --> 15:59.559
WAIT, NO, NO, NO--
STOP PEEING.

15:59.592 --> 16:01.728
OH, SHOOT, I'LL
CLEAN THAT LATER.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.132
THIS IS A NIGHTMARE.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.102
[upbeat jazz music]

16:09.136 --> 16:11.104
HEY, MORGAN,
YOU SEEN MINDY ANYWHERE?

16:11.138 --> 16:13.740
NO, NO. HEY...

16:13.773 --> 16:15.075
THANK YOU FOR
THROWING A WEDDING

16:15.108 --> 16:16.676
WHERE I FEEL COMFORTABLE.

16:16.709 --> 16:18.345
YEAH, MAN.
GLAD YOU'RE HAVING FUN.

16:18.378 --> 16:20.047
I FEEL ACCEPTED
IN MY TRACKSUIT.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.548
YOU KNOW,
NO ONE'S JUDGING ME

16:21.581 --> 16:22.782
FOR DIGGING
INTO THE CAKE EARLY.

16:22.815 --> 16:23.783
IT'S JUST--IT'S NICE.

16:23.816 --> 16:27.454
JUST, LIKE, LOW STAKES.
MAN, HAVE FUN, WHATEVER.

16:29.122 --> 16:30.657
UH-HUH.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.692
I LIKE
THESE ONE-ON-ONE TALKS.

16:34.261 --> 16:36.063
ALL RIGHT.

16:39.199 --> 16:41.668
MINDY?

16:41.701 --> 16:43.703
MINDY...

16:54.114 --> 16:56.516
ARE YOU WEARING
A BED SHEET?

16:56.549 --> 16:58.785
HEY. WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

16:58.818 --> 17:00.720
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE
PROPOSING TO CHRISTINA

17:00.753 --> 17:02.789
ON A GONDOLA IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE GOWANUS CANAL OR SOMETHING?

17:02.822 --> 17:06.126
THAT'S OFFENSIVE.
I WAS GONNA DO IT...

17:06.159 --> 17:08.828
BUT...I DIDN'T.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.531
I LOVE HER, BUT WHEN
IT COMES DOWN TO IT...

17:11.564 --> 17:13.800
JUST BEING WITH HER
EVERY DAY--I JUST...

17:13.833 --> 17:16.803
WASN'T HAPPY.

17:16.836 --> 17:19.406
I THINK YOU MADE
THE RIGHT DECISION.

17:19.439 --> 17:20.773
YEAH?
YEAH.

17:20.807 --> 17:22.309
CAN I CONFESS SOMETHING?
SURE.

17:22.342 --> 17:24.544
I DON'T WANT TO
GO BACK TO HAITI.

17:24.577 --> 17:26.079
I MEAN, I LIKE THE WORK
THAT I WAS DOING THERE,

17:26.113 --> 17:28.215
BUT I-I JUST--
I MISS BEING HERE.

17:28.248 --> 17:29.682
I KNEW YOU WERE UNHAPPY.

17:29.716 --> 17:30.683
REALLY? HOW?
YEAH.

17:30.717 --> 17:34.087
WELL, YOU WROTE ME,
LIKE, EVERY WEEK, SO...

17:34.121 --> 17:35.755
MORE LIKE YOU WROTE ME
EVERY WEEK.

17:35.788 --> 17:37.290
I HAVE A STACK OF LETTERS
FROM YOU THIS HIGH.

17:37.324 --> 17:38.158
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

17:38.191 --> 17:40.093
YOU KEPT THEM ALL?
YOU'RE SUCH A STALKER.

17:40.127 --> 17:41.394
I LIKE THE WAY
YOU WRITE LETTERS.

17:41.428 --> 17:45.765
YOU DON'T RAMBLE ON
LIKE YOU DO WHEN YOU TALK.

17:45.798 --> 17:49.169
YOU KNOW, I REALLY THOUGHT
THAT I CHANGED, BUT I DIDN'T.

17:49.202 --> 17:51.404
I JUST GOT GOOD
AT PRETENDING

17:51.438 --> 17:54.241
TO LIKE THINGS
THAT I DON'T LIKE.

17:54.274 --> 17:56.409
WELL, AS LONG AS YOU'RE
NOT PRETENDING TO LIKE

17:56.443 --> 17:58.445
THE GUY YOU'RE
ABOUT TO MARRY.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.349
I'M NOT.

18:02.382 --> 18:04.684
THEN GO GET MARRIED.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE?

18:04.717 --> 18:07.854
YEAH, THERE'S ACTUALLY PEE
ALL OVER MY WEDDING DRESS.

18:07.887 --> 18:08.988
I'M GONNA BLOW PAST THAT.
I DON'T--

18:09.021 --> 18:11.858
I SURPRISED HIM,
AND HE PEED ON IT.
I DON'T--I'M GOOD.

18:15.295 --> 18:18.598
YOU KNOW WHAT I ALWAYS THOUGHT
YOU LOOKED NICE IN?

18:18.631 --> 18:21.601

18:21.634 --> 18:23.803
*

18:23.836 --> 18:26.773
* SOMETHING IN THE WAY
YOU LOVE ME *

18:26.806 --> 18:29.176
* WON'T LET ME BE

18:29.209 --> 18:31.711
*

18:31.744 --> 18:35.148
* I DON'T WANT
TO BE YOUR PRISONER *

18:35.182 --> 18:36.883
* SO, BABY, WON'T YOU

18:36.916 --> 18:40.153
* SET ME FREE?

18:40.187 --> 18:41.654
HEY, HOLD UP.
STOP THE TRACK.

18:41.688 --> 18:43.790
[music stops]

18:43.823 --> 18:45.592
JUST, MINDY,
I DON'T WANT TO MARRY YOU.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.260
[others gasping]
OH, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

18:47.294 --> 18:48.695
I MEAN LIKE THIS.
I DO WANT TO MARRY YOU.

18:48.728 --> 18:50.530
I WANT TO MARRY HER.
SORRY.

18:50.563 --> 18:51.564
WHY WOULD YOU
SAY IT LIKE THAT?

18:51.598 --> 18:53.233
I KNOW, I'M SORRY,
NOT COOL.

18:53.266 --> 18:54.234
SHOULDN'T HAVE
SAID IT LIKE THAT.

18:54.267 --> 18:55.302
[stammers]
BUT THIS WEDDING

18:55.335 --> 18:56.469
IS NOT COOL EITHER,
RIGHT?

18:56.503 --> 18:59.672
I DO NOT CARE ABOUT A FANCY,
EXPENSIVE WEDDING, CASEY.

18:59.706 --> 19:01.841
NO, IT'S NOT THAT
THIS ISN'T EXPENSIVE.

19:01.874 --> 19:02.709
IT'S THAT IT'S NOT YOU.

19:02.742 --> 19:04.744
YOU WANNA COME OUT OF
A PUMPKIN CARRIAGE

19:04.777 --> 19:06.846
CARRIED BY FOUR GAY DUDES,
LIKE CLEOPATRA.

19:06.879 --> 19:08.481
NO, I DON'T.

19:08.515 --> 19:09.849
YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE
A WEDDING IN OUR APARTMENT.

19:09.882 --> 19:11.751
WE SHOULD BE
RENTING OUT THE PLAZA,

19:11.784 --> 19:13.753
AND IT SHOULD BE
SO FANCY THAT BANE,

19:13.786 --> 19:15.422
FROM THE BATMAN MOVIES,

19:15.455 --> 19:16.523
BUSTS IN THROUGH A SKYLIGHT,

19:16.556 --> 19:17.690
SLITS MY THROAT,

19:17.724 --> 19:19.259
AND THEN TAKES YOU
AS PRISONER.

19:19.292 --> 19:21.594
TOM HARDY TAKES ME
AS HIS SEX PRISONER?

19:21.628 --> 19:24.397
NO, THAT'S THE ACTOR.
BANE, THE CHARACTER.
SORRY, YEAH.

19:24.431 --> 19:26.866
WHICH IS WHY I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD COME BACK TO HAITI.

19:26.899 --> 19:28.668
WHAT?

19:28.701 --> 19:30.903
THE WEDDING YOU DESERVE,
IT'S EXPENSIVE, RIGHT?

19:30.937 --> 19:33.840
YEAH.
AND I MAKE,
LIKE, NOTHING.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.508
SO I-I SHOULD STAY HERE.

19:35.542 --> 19:37.577
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
AND THEN DOWN THE LINE--

19:37.610 --> 19:41.348
I MEAN, PASTORS, WE ARE
PAID IN THE AFTERLIFE, OKAY?

19:41.381 --> 19:43.583
OKAY. PERFECT.
SO WE'LL HAVE A MCMANSION,
WE'LL HAVE A FOUNTAIN.

19:43.616 --> 19:44.917
GREAT.
WE'LL BE LIVING
IN HEAVEN HEIGHTS.

19:44.951 --> 19:46.619
YEAH, AND I'M GONNA STAY HERE.
THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

19:46.653 --> 19:48.388
[sighs in relief]
THANK YOU. I LOVE YOU.

19:48.421 --> 19:50.823
I LOVE YOU.

19:50.857 --> 19:53.326
(as Bane)
MINDY, I'VE KILLED CASEY.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.861
OKAY, THAT'S SCARY GOOD.

20:32.932 --> 20:34.801
HI, MINDY.
OH, GOD.

20:34.834 --> 20:37.804
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

20:37.837 --> 20:39.406
YOU HAVE
A VERY LIGHT TREAD.

20:39.439 --> 20:41.508
YEAH, I'M PART CHEROKEE.

20:41.541 --> 20:42.542
NOT ME.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.311
I HAVE AN EXTREMELY
HEAVY TREAD.

20:44.344 --> 20:45.412
WHEN I WALK AROUND,
I'M LIKE,

20:45.445 --> 20:46.913
STOMP, STOMP,
STOMP, STOMP.

20:46.946 --> 20:50.049
THEY CAN'T EVEN RENT OUT
THE APARTMENT BELOW ME.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.851
SO, WHAT HAPPENED?
DID YOU MISS YOUR FLIGHT?

20:51.884 --> 20:54.721
NO, ACTUALLY, I AM NOT
GOING TO HAITI ANYMORE.

20:54.754 --> 20:55.822
YOU'RE NOT?

20:55.855 --> 20:57.624
NO. YEAH.
WELL...

20:57.657 --> 20:59.792
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,
I THINK YOU DODGED A BULLET.

20:59.826 --> 21:01.461
I DIDN'T WANT TO
SAY ANYTHING BEFORE,

21:01.494 --> 21:03.863
BUT THAT GUY HAS
BIG-TIME GAY FACE.

21:03.896 --> 21:05.064
OKAY, I'M GONNA STOP YOU
RIGHT THERE.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.933
I AM STILL ENGAGED.

21:06.966 --> 21:08.635
THAT'S A GOOD CHOICE, TOO.
I'M GONNA STAY HERE.

21:08.668 --> 21:09.869
YEAH.
YEAH, HE'S HETEROSEXUAL.

21:09.902 --> 21:11.471
SO AM I, SO...
OH, FANTASTIC.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.340
AND--AND--
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

21:13.373 --> 21:15.975
I'M GONNA BE A DOCTOR.

21:16.008 --> 21:18.745
COOL.
WHERE ARE YOU GONNA WORK?

21:18.778 --> 21:21.748
HERE,
AT THE PRACTICE.

21:21.781 --> 21:22.915
WHERE ARE YOU GONNA WORK?

21:22.949 --> 21:24.817
