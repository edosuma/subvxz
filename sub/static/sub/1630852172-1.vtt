51:08.875 --> 51:11.166

there's something to win.

51:24.583 --> 51:26.291
But I'm not playing your game.

51:26.375 --> 51:28.041

means nothing to me.

51:29.500 --> 51:32.583
That's right.
How could I forget?

51:32.666 --> 51:34.208
People like you don't win.
They steal.

51:36.083 --> 51:37.250
Just like your dad did.

51:38.416 --> 51:39.750
So...

52:28.875 --> 52:31.250

52:35.500 --> 52:36.625
Yeah, maybe.

52:39.291 --> 52:41.583

be there when you do.

Sir, can you just--

52:43.083 --> 52:45.083

-This could go on your record.
-No, it won't. I'll--

53:21.000 --> 53:23.666
I'll tell them
that I had no idea
Julien got me the scholarship.

53:23.750 --> 53:26.375
-You mean you'll lie?
-I had no idea, Dad. Really.

53:27.875 --> 53:31.833

gotten it anyway, right?
