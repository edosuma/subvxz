16:53.328 --> 16:54.417
Bulkhead to optimus.

16:54.418 --> 16:56.292
Rendezvous to my coordinates.

16:56.758 --> 16:58.451
I'm in need of backup.

17:29.372 --> 17:32.431
[ Electricity crackles ]

17:35.697 --> 17:37.304
[ Grunts ]

17:41.918 --> 17:44.290
[ Beeping ]

18:03.911 --> 18:05.966
Sir, incoming bogeys.

18:08.043 --> 18:09.352
All units,

18:09.736 --> 18:12.905
disengage and initiate omega protocols.

18:28.680 --> 18:29.947
Your backup?

18:39.128 --> 18:40.823
Commander starscream!

18:41.029 --> 18:43.794
Consorting with the enemy, breakdown?

18:43.795 --> 18:45.731
But bulkhead got me out of there.

18:46.030 --> 18:49.657
Many spark-felt thanks, autobot.

18:49.663 --> 18:51.676
Now destroy him.

18:55.050 --> 18:56.915
- But you...
- Do you plan on joining

18:56.916 --> 18:59.017
their ranks anytime soon?!

18:59.018 --> 19:02.046
No?! Then be done with him already!

19:07.096 --> 19:08.760
Tough break, bulkhead.

19:08.887 --> 19:10.465
Maybe in the next life.

19:10.466 --> 19:11.829
[ Grunts ]

19:16.382 --> 19:17.768
Destroy hi...

19:17.769 --> 19:19.267
Aaah!

19:25.027 --> 19:27.573
Hammer time!

19:29.926 --> 19:32.612
Come on! I'll scrap all of you!

19:41.146 --> 19:43.073
[ Growls ]

19:43.074 --> 19:44.697
Retreat!

19:55.685 --> 19:58.980
[ Engine revs ]

20:01.313 --> 20:06.294
Engaging the enemy on your own was even
more foolish this time, bulkhead.

20:06.432 --> 20:11.098
But I am honored that you saw fit
to rescue your rival.

20:11.492 --> 20:14.608
You have truly risen above yourself.

20:14.653 --> 20:15.652
Did you see?

20:15.653 --> 20:19.119
I beat breakdown and bashed
them all with his own hammer!

20:19.120 --> 20:21.319
I won the rematch!

20:22.473 --> 20:25.403
I'm sure Miko would be proud.

20:29.513 --> 20:32.062
[ Tires screech ]

20:32.345 --> 20:35.948
Starscream: One day, you will repay
your debt to me, breakdown...

20:35.949 --> 20:39.336
The day it comes time to choose sides.

20:41.782 --> 20:43.513
Uh, between 'bots and 'cons?

20:43.514 --> 20:47.368
Between myself and Megatron.

20:48.797 --> 20:54.724
Incidentally, I suggest that
Megatron never know of this rescue.

20:54.825 --> 20:58.335
You do want him to think
you overcame the puny humans

20:58.336 --> 21:00.873
on your own, don't you?

21:05.473 --> 21:07.585
Silas: The test subject escaped,

21:07.586 --> 21:09.585
but we've managed
to sanitize the location

21:09.586 --> 21:13.171
and transfer most of the newly
acquired data to another facility.

21:13.172 --> 21:15.753
The diagnostic scans of
the subject's vital components

21:15.754 --> 21:19.424
were thorough enough for us
to initiate project chimera.

21:19.661 --> 21:24.080
The power of the living machines
will, someday soon...

21:24.081 --> 21:26.213
