WEBVTT

00:02.733 --> 00:03.966
‐ Hey!
‐ Hey.

00:04.033 --> 00:06.100
We just got back from
the Thompsons' garage sale

00:06.166 --> 00:08.066
and boy, did we hit the jackpot.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.000
Say the Thompsons
hit the jackpot

00:11.066 --> 00:13.600
when they saw you two suckers.

00:13.666 --> 00:17.200
Obviously, you're not
a garage sale connoisseur.

00:17.266 --> 00:23.066
My baby is playin' a genuine
faux leopard ensemble.

00:23.133 --> 00:27.933
And in my hand is a virtual
cornucopia of 60's classics.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.633
Oh, dear, dear, dear,
if only there was someone

00:30.700 --> 00:33.266
in the brownstone who still
had a record player.

00:33.333 --> 00:35.333
Oh, snap!
Look what I found.

00:35.400 --> 00:36.866
[laughs]

00:36.933 --> 00:38.633
Hey, hey, hey, be careful
with that now.

00:38.700 --> 00:42.300
That is an exquisitely preserved
Barbie collectible.

00:42.366 --> 00:44.533
Made even more special
by the fact that

00:44.600 --> 00:48.566
little artistic Ne‐ne
painted Barbie black.

00:48.633 --> 00:50.333
With that blonde hair,
she's a dead ringer

00:50.400 --> 00:52.166
for Mary J. Blige.

00:52.233 --> 00:53.300
Oh, let's see what
we've got here.

00:53.366 --> 00:55.333
Oh, oh,
"Martha and the Vandellas"

00:55.400 --> 00:57.433
and, "Up the Charelles" and..

00:57.500 --> 01:01.040
My personal favorite,
"Shonda and the Shoopettes"

01:01.106 --> 01:03.040
who immortalized
that famous phrase

01:03.106 --> 01:07.206
"Doo‐wop shoop‐shoop‐shoop shoop
shoop‐doo‐wop shoop‐shoop."

01:09.673 --> 01:11.873
I don't know how you can get
so worked up about music

01:11.940 --> 01:13.806
that was played out
before we were born.

01:13.873 --> 01:16.806
Oh, shoot, girl, all those
beautiful girl‐groups

01:16.873 --> 01:21.240
in the 60's with their big hair
and their big..

01:21.306 --> 01:24.606

it's "The Supremes."

02:42.146 --> 02:46.513
Hmm, shall we vote
or save her some embarrassment?

02:46.580 --> 02:47.780

Regine made me give

03:26.553 --> 03:29.153
Well, I'm too tired
to put up with you.

03:29.220 --> 03:33.753
But Regine and the cast
of "Fame" are inside dancing.

03:33.820 --> 03:37.753

You know, I think we all need
to be reminded..

04:54.693 --> 04:57.960
...just who started this group,
"The Flavorettes."

04:58.026 --> 04:59.093
Me!

04:59.160 --> 05:01.300
'Now, when I found you,
you were nothing.'

05:01.366 --> 05:04.300
And you would be
nothing without me.

05:06.133 --> 05:07.700
Nothing.

05:07.766 --> 05:09.333
Nothing, nothing.

05:09.400 --> 05:12.833
That's what a black man
in America has, nothing.

05:14.666 --> 05:16.800
Well, we would have something
if you'd start singin'

05:16.866 --> 05:19.133
and stopped hanging out
with those black leopards.

05:20.933 --> 05:24.633
Black Panthers.
Black Panthers, man!

05:24.700 --> 05:28.166
Hey, hey, hey, peace and love,
girls, peace and love!

05:28.233 --> 05:29.900
Now, all your bickering
is upsettin'

05:29.966 --> 05:32.733
my sweet wheezing Rupert.

05:32.800 --> 05:35.566
Well, maybe,
sweet wheezing Rupert

05:35.633 --> 05:38.133
can stop suckin'
on that inhaler.

05:38.200 --> 05:41.800
Maybe he can manage to tell us
if he booked us a gig.

05:44.266 --> 05:47.800
Well, uh, uh, my‐my cousin
Marietta said we could play

05:47.866 --> 05:50.466
at her big bridge party
in Chitalling‐Chow.

05:52.466 --> 05:56.066
God, what kind of
jerk manager are you?

05:56.133 --> 05:59.300
Oh, oh, God.

06:01.073 --> 06:03.573
Guys, you know the offer still
stands for us to go and play

06:03.640 --> 06:05.740
for my steady
down at the Highline Club.

06:05.806 --> 06:07.540
Okay, I'm against that
for three reason.

06:09.373 --> 06:12.406
Number one, it wasn't my idea.

06:12.473 --> 06:15.506
Number two, it's not
a big enough house.

06:15.573 --> 06:18.340
Number three, it was your idea.

06:19.973 --> 06:22.140
Well, I think that
we should take the job.

06:22.206 --> 06:24.106
I mean, I sure could
use the money.

06:24.173 --> 06:27.106
Embutu, the little African boy
that I sponsor

06:27.173 --> 06:29.940
he lost his goat
in the last heavy rain.

06:34.140 --> 06:36.740
Look, man, dig this.

06:36.806 --> 06:38.640
Now, we need to go shake
our groove thing

06:38.706 --> 06:40.340
down at the Highline Club

06:40.406 --> 06:42.040
so we can be seen.

06:42.106 --> 06:43.406
Come on, who's in?

06:43.473 --> 06:44.840
'Who's in?'

06:44.906 --> 06:48.040
Oh, right, right, I'm in,
I'm in! I'm in! I'm in!

06:48.106 --> 06:50.473
We'll change the lyrics though.
Think about this.

06:50.540 --> 06:53.173
Tell him that our children
are starving.

06:53.240 --> 06:56.473
Tell him that the time
of oppression is over.

06:56.540 --> 07:00.746
Tell him! Tell him! Tell him!
Tell him we need jobs, man!

07:00.813 --> 07:02.746
We need jobs, man!

07:03.946 --> 07:05.880
Sorry, brother.
I'm sorry, brother.

07:07.313 --> 07:10.346
Alright, I'm with it.
We play at the club.

07:10.413 --> 07:11.580
Yeah, man.

07:11.646 --> 07:14.246
But no more lyrics
from Cynthia X.

07:16.680 --> 07:19.280
Girl, you need to get
with that high comb.

07:21.413 --> 07:22.846
‐ Keepin' it natural, man.
‐ No!

07:22.913 --> 07:23.980
‐ Keepin' it natural.
‐ No!

07:25.646 --> 07:27.780
Why, sister, why?

07:28.613 --> 07:31.546
Why? Think about it! Why?

07:36.346 --> 07:39.246
Come on, stop it, now.
Stop it.

07:39.313 --> 07:40.713
I'm spoken for.

07:40.780 --> 07:43.046
That's right,
and I speak loudly.

07:43.113 --> 07:44.546
Get your own damn man.

07:52.280 --> 07:55.146
Hey, groovy people,
welcome to the Highline.

Sunny Clifton.

07:58.180 --> 07:59.746
If I'd known
you were so pretty

07:59.813 --> 08:02.753
we'd have taken you up on
that invitation a lot sooner.

08:14.620 --> 08:16.720
Who is that sugar daddy?

08:18.020 --> 08:21.586
The man who put "Shonda
and Shoopettes" on the map.

08:21.653 --> 08:23.720
And Shonda's husband
on the curb.

08:25.186 --> 08:28.686
That's right, kid, it's me.
OW Jones.

08:28.753 --> 08:31.686
This could be the luckiest night
of your life.

08:31.753 --> 08:33.686
And you won't be
disappointed, Mr. Jones.

08:33.753 --> 08:35.186
Thanks for coming out
to hear me.

08:35.253 --> 08:37.785
Yeah, you can, uh, thank me
by putting my butt in a seat

08:37.852 --> 08:40.553
a drink in my hand and another
girl on my arm for balance.

08:40.620 --> 08:42.320
‐ Oh, here you go.
‐ Oh, okay.

08:42.385 --> 08:43.486
Yeah, this will do.

08:55.353 --> 08:58.820
Sing until my husband starts
to look good to me again.

08:58.886 --> 09:01.760
Huh! Hey, hey, hey.
Thanks for loving me, baby.

09:01.826 --> 09:03.960
But before I shake,
rattle and roll

09:04.026 --> 09:06.460
I want to introduce you
