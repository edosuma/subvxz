01:15.480 --> 01:18.199
Oh, my God, Mom. I found it!

01:18.440 --> 01:21.238
Oh, it must have been
decomposing down here for months.

01:21.840 --> 01:23.717
What are we gonna do
when he gets it out?

01:23.960 --> 01:27.157
Well, I guess we'll just say a prayer
and flush it down the toilet...

01:27.360 --> 01:29.999
...like we did
when your goldfish died.

01:30.840 --> 01:32.512
Okay, back, people! Back!

01:32.760 --> 01:35.752
Now, give me some room!
Give me some room!

01:40.480 --> 01:42.550
God, it stinks.

01:42.800 --> 01:45.678
Did you find his other bowling shoe
down there?

01:46.760 --> 01:48.159
No, just the eyelets.

01:49.880 --> 01:51.996
I'm gonna go throw this thing
in the back yard.

01:52.240 --> 01:55.755
That's a good idea, honey.
Just put it out with Buck's house.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.834
You know how he likes to roll around
with your father's old things.

02:04.920 --> 02:06.956
Well, I guess he's not finished...

02:07.160 --> 02:10.948
...with your father's
"Home of the Whopper" jockey shorts.

02:13.520 --> 02:15.670
Well, Peg, I got them.

02:20.280 --> 02:21.633
Third row, centre aisle.

02:21.880 --> 02:24.758
The best seats in the house
for the greatest show on earth.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.752
What, Public Enemy?

02:27.640 --> 02:29.312
Nirvana?

02:29.560 --> 02:31.357
Carla and Her Disappearing
Vegetables?

02:40.080 --> 02:42.674
l... I mean the rock group.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.913
Not the blond stripper who's making
a squash disappear for Thanksgiving.

02:50.400 --> 02:53.392
No, pig-in-training.

02:53.600 --> 02:56.114
These are tickets
to The Jeffersons Live.

02:56.360 --> 02:58.715
It's their "Moving On Up" tour.

03:01.400 --> 03:05.632
What, was the Facts of Life
"Eating On Up" tour all sold out?

03:06.240 --> 03:07.798
Oh, Marcie, I can't believe it.

03:08.040 --> 03:10.190
We are actually gonna see
George and Weezy...

03:10.400 --> 03:14.757
...perform episodes from their sitcom
live on stage.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.231
Now, when you say "live"
do you mean...

03:17.480 --> 03:23.157
...live as opposed to on TV,
or live as opposed to Daddy?

03:25.560 --> 03:28.597
Look, we are talking
about the Jeffersons.

03:28.840 --> 03:30.592
They made me understand
the greatness...

03:30.800 --> 03:32.916
...of the African-American culture.

03:33.160 --> 03:36.197
I used to think
I was a hip white chick...

03:37.640 --> 03:39.596
...but then I saw George and Weezy...

03:39.840 --> 03:43.469
...and they me realize
that I'm just a square honky peg...

03:43.720 --> 03:46.188
...in a round, black world.

03:51.520 --> 03:52.839
Well, I guess I can relate.

03:53.040 --> 03:57.079
If Beavis and Butthead did a live show
90 years from now, I'd be there.

03:58.760 --> 04:01.718
Kelly, Beavis and Butthead
are cartoons.

04:02.640 --> 04:06.110
They prefer to be called
"dimensionally challenged," Bud.

04:09.200 --> 04:12.670
- Why do I feel so alone?
- Because no one likes you?

04:14.640 --> 04:16.153
Peg.

04:27.400 --> 04:28.879
Peg, I got good news.

04:29.200 --> 04:31.873
- So do we.
- No one cares.

04:33.880 --> 04:35.438
Peg, I heard they're opening up...

04:35.640 --> 04:37.710
...a brand-new sports bar
in the neighbourhood.

04:37.960 --> 04:40.190
Finally, a place
a man can relax after work.

04:40.400 --> 04:41.799
Well, what about home?

04:46.040 --> 04:48.474
Finally, a place a man can relax
after work.

04:50.080 --> 04:51.718
A place where women
bring you food.

04:51.960 --> 04:55.111
Chips and pretzels,
nuts with sugar on them.

04:55.360 --> 04:57.635
Al, you haven't even asked us
about our good news.

04:57.880 --> 04:59.108
I'm sorry, Peg. What is it?

04:59.360 --> 05:01.749
- We got four tickets...
- Another thing they'll have:

05:02.000 --> 05:03.877
Twelve TVs,
each with a different game on.

05:04.120 --> 05:05.394
Peg, I tell you, I'm so hot.

05:05.640 --> 05:08.598
If Marcie wasn't here,
I'd take you on the floor right now.

05:13.640 --> 05:15.631
Get out, Marcie.

05:16.520 --> 05:18.795
Never mind. The mood has passed.

05:20.760 --> 05:23.752
Well, all I can say is I'm glad
my man is evolved to the point...

05:24.000 --> 05:26.912
...where he doesn't need
a sports bar to go to.

05:27.480 --> 05:29.198
Hey, Al.

05:34.120 --> 05:35.792
Did you hear
about the new sports bar?

05:36.680 --> 05:38.272
Sure did.

05:38.520 --> 05:40.636
Ickey Shuffle.

05:44.120 --> 05:46.793
Did you hear they'll have a pair
of Ali's gloves on display?

05:47.040 --> 05:51.716
- Yes, I did. And Mantle's spikes.
- Plus Michael Jordan's putter.

05:51.960 --> 05:56.192
Yes, but are they gonna have the actual
door that George Jefferson slammed...

05:56.440 --> 05:57.953
...in the Willis' face?

06:03.920 --> 06:06.480
Speaking of Michael Jordan...

06:06.720 --> 06:10.349
...I bet you don't know who was picked
ahead of him in the 1984 NBA draft.

06:10.600 --> 06:13.558
- Sam Bowie. Went to the Trail Blazers.
- Good call, buddy.

06:16.080 --> 06:17.559
All right, Al, I got one for you.

06:17.760 --> 06:20.115
When was the last time the Cubs
won the World Series?

06:20.360 --> 06:21.509
1908.

06:22.080 --> 06:25.675
And you can't remember
the year we were married?

06:27.800 --> 06:30.075
Same year, 1908.

06:33.640 --> 06:36.791
Only difference is,
baseball's still interesting.

06:41.760 --> 06:46.390
Well, maybe that's because
they score more than once a season.

06:51.080 --> 06:52.832
Okay, Al.

06:53.720 --> 06:55.312
I've got one that's gonna stump you.

06:55.520 --> 06:58.637
All right, who was in the very first
light-beer commercial?

06:58.880 --> 07:02.509
No problem. You're talking beer,
you're talking my language.

07:02.760 --> 07:06.389
You're talking beer,
you're talking his belly.

07:08.960 --> 07:12.589
Why do I have an uncontrollable urge
to play T-ball?

07:16.520 --> 07:19.557
- The answer is Bubba Smith.
- Billy Martin.

07:19.800 --> 07:22.792
Bubba Smith. Wore a blue shirt
with a black penguin on the pocket.

07:23.040 --> 07:26.271
Hey, Al, what was I wearing
the day you met me?

07:26.520 --> 07:27.589
Too much makeup.

07:29.440 --> 07:31.237
- It was Billy Martin.
- Bubba Smith.

07:31.480 --> 07:32.754
- Billy.
- Bubba. Bubba.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.035
- Bubba.
- Billy.

07:34.240 --> 07:35.229
- Bubba.
- Billy.

07:36.720 --> 07:40.395
Hello, Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms?

07:40.640 --> 07:43.518
Yeah, I have an alcohol question.

07:44.360 --> 07:47.955
Who was in the first light-beer
commercial? Now, I say...

07:49.000 --> 07:51.833
Now, I say it was Bubba Smith,
but my friend here says it was...

07:52.040 --> 07:53.359
Hello?

07:53.600 --> 07:55.318
Hello?

07:59.280 --> 08:01.555
He said it was Bubba.

08:02.560 --> 08:03.993
- Billy.
- Bubba.

08:04.200 --> 08:05.155
- Billy.
- Billy.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.793
Bubba.

08:10.560 --> 08:12.630
That's no fair.
You stole that from Bugs Bunny.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.114
- Daffy.
- Bugs.

08:14.360 --> 08:15.839
- Daffy. Daffy.
- Bugs. Bugs.

08:16.080 --> 08:21.552
Hey, hey, why are you two introducing
yourselves to each other?

08:22.680 --> 08:25.114
You guys have been doing this
for two days.

08:25.360 --> 08:28.238
And we demand you pay us
some attention.

08:28.920 --> 08:30.592
All right.

08:30.840 --> 08:32.193
- Bubba.
- Billy.

08:32.440 --> 08:33.668
You know what we can do?

08:33.880 --> 08:35.950
We can ask them Friday night
at the sports bar.

08:36.200 --> 08:38.191
- Yeah, great.
- Friday?

08:38.440 --> 08:40.556
Friday night is our play.

08:41.320 --> 08:42.832
What play?

08:43.080 --> 08:46.436
The Jeffersons "Moving on Up" tour.

08:48.040 --> 08:51.510
What are they moving on up to,
channel 99?

08:54.600 --> 08:57.512
Al, we have been talking about this
for two days.

08:57.760 --> 09:01.514
- You never listen to me.
- Well, why would I? I got a TV.

09:03.760 --> 09:08.914
I know. It's the only thing
you've turned on in 20 years.

09:11.120 --> 09:13.076
If you came with a remote
and mute button...

09:13.280 --> 09:15.953
...I might turn you on too
every now and then.

09:18.840 --> 09:23.038
Listen to me. I gotta be there opening
night. You know who's gonna be there?

09:23.280 --> 09:25.475
Johnny Bench, Ernie Banks
and Joe Namath.

09:26.120 --> 09:29.078
Yawn, gag and snore.

09:29.720 --> 09:32.757
- Now, listen here, Peg.
- No, no, no, Al. You listen to me.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.434
Now, you weren't there
when Kelly was born.

09:35.680 --> 09:37.716
You weren't there
when Bud was born.

09:37.960 --> 09:41.077
I don't think you were even there
when they were conceived.

09:42.120 --> 09:46.830
Now, this play is important to me
and you will be there.

09:47.080 --> 09:50.595
Do I even have to open my mouth?

09:52.000 --> 09:53.228
Nope, nope. I'm there.

09:53.480 --> 09:58.156
Moving on up to the East Side,
the West Side, all around the town.

09:59.280 --> 10:03.068
Fine. Now that that's settled,
let's go buy some clothes.

10:03.320 --> 10:07.108
Oh, you're right.
We must accessorize for the theatre.

10:18.120 --> 10:21.192
Oh, God, how sad.

10:22.480 --> 10:24.357
Anyway, Dad...

10:24.600 --> 10:28.275
...I just heard the sports bar's opening
the same night as the Jeffersons tour.

10:28.520 --> 10:31.592
Which one are you going to?

10:32.840 --> 10:34.068
Yeah.

10:35.520 --> 10:40.548
Kids, you wanna do old Dad a favour
before he kills you?

10:52.400 --> 10:54.436
You know, they call Chicago
the second city...

10:54.640 --> 10:56.995
...because we're supposed to
be inferior to New York.

10:57.240 --> 11:00.949
But with theatre like this,
we have nothing to be ashamed of.

11:01.200 --> 11:03.191
Let's open our
"Moving On Up" souvenir bags.

11:03.840 --> 11:06.718
We can use them
when our dinner starts moving on up.

11:14.760 --> 11:18.355
Okay, Al. Who am I?

11:18.600 --> 11:20.397
Patrick Ewing?

11:21.760 --> 11:24.877
No, you Philistine. I'm Weezy.

11:25.120 --> 11:26.678
Well, I'm woozy.

11:28.880 --> 11:31.997
Ladies and gentlemen, a brief
announcement before our show starts.

11:32.240 --> 11:37.234
Tonight the role of Ralph the Doorman
will be played by Erik Estrada.

11:43.800 --> 11:46.075
Well, he was Ponch.

11:50.880 --> 11:52.108
There go the lights.

11:52.360 --> 11:54.157
You know what we have to do.

11:54.400 --> 11:59.076
Ladies and gentlemen,
give it up for the Jeffersons.

12:44.360 --> 12:47.955
Look at this, Jefferson.
Every sport known to man.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.679
Baseball, football...

12:50.200 --> 12:53.272
...girls in bikinis
wrestling in lettuce.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.516
Jefferson, if I thought
heaven was like this...

12:57.760 --> 13:00.274
...l'd have put a bullet
in my brain years ago.

13:00.520 --> 13:04.832
If I thought you had a chance in hell
of getting in, I'd do it for you, buddy.

13:05.280 --> 13:07.271
- Thanks, man. I love you.
- Yeah.

13:10.760 --> 13:12.512
Al, Al. Over there.

13:13.080 --> 13:15.958
It's Ernie Banks.
Gotta get a picture with him!

13:20.920 --> 13:24.196
Wait a second. You can't just go up
to Mr. Cub and drool all over him.

13:24.440 --> 13:26.795
That's a... That's a legend,
a Hall of Famer.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.270
You gotta respect his privacy.

13:29.520 --> 13:32.432
You know, you... Shoot it, damn it!

13:32.680 --> 13:34.989
I'm blind.

13:35.240 --> 13:39.836
You hit 512 homers. Imagine how good
you'd be if you could see.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.752
We're just kidding, Ernie. You okay?

13:42.000 --> 13:44.912
- Yeah, I guess.
- Good. Shoot, Al!

13:46.120 --> 13:47.394
- Thanks, pal.
- Ernie Banks.

13:47.640 --> 13:49.596
I can't see.

13:50.520 --> 13:52.112
What a great guy.

14:04.040 --> 14:06.554
Officer Dan. Let me guess.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.472
Jeffersons Live.

14:08.720 --> 14:12.395
I would have been here sooner,
but my kids showed up late.

14:37.680 --> 14:39.079
Okay, watch this, Al.

14:39.320 --> 14:42.756
Now, Florence is gonna hold up
a jock strap and say, "What's that?"

14:43.000 --> 14:45.275
And then George is gonna say,
"That's my cup."

14:45.520 --> 14:49.638
And she's gonna say, " How the heck
you gonna drink out of that?"

14:50.760 --> 14:53.832
- What's that?
- Oh, that's my cup.

14:54.760 --> 14:57.149
How the heck
do you drink out of that?

15:00.560 --> 15:03.870
And you wanted to go
to a sports bar.

15:04.120 --> 15:07.669
Hey, where's the guy
who says "Dynomite"?

15:10.040 --> 15:13.828
No, that's the other show,
Gimme a Strok e.

15:17.880 --> 15:20.792
This is the lowest thing
that I have ever done.

15:23.560 --> 15:26.677
Okay, the lowest thing
I've ever been paid to do.

15:29.760 --> 15:33.719
Okay, the lowest thing I've ever been
paid to do that I didn't enjoy.

15:37.680 --> 15:41.593
If you ask me, the Willis'
were way ahead of their time.

15:44.280 --> 15:47.238
Your hands are moist like mine.

15:47.480 --> 15:51.234
But then watching The Jeffersons
always made me horny.

15:54.080 --> 15:58.995
What say the next time the scenes
change and the lights go out, we...

16:05.000 --> 16:08.356
What's wrong with women?
Don't they know what real fun is?

16:08.600 --> 16:12.309
I know what you mean.
Check out Shaquille's foot.

16:13.520 --> 16:15.670
The size of it alone
is better than anything...

16:15.920 --> 16:17.717
...the Jeffersons have ever done.
- Yeah.

16:17.960 --> 16:19.757
And look at that
massive hand imprint.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.558
Who's is it? Wilt Chamberlain's?

16:21.800 --> 16:24.633
"Martina Navratilova."

16:25.720 --> 16:27.551
You know what they say
about big hands?

16:29.040 --> 16:31.270
- Johnny Bench!
- Johnny Bench!

16:35.840 --> 16:37.398
Quick!

16:38.320 --> 16:40.231
Get a picture!

16:43.760 --> 16:45.830
It's okay. He never won a pennant.

16:46.400 --> 16:49.119
Or scored four touchdowns
in a single game, eh, John?

16:50.560 --> 16:53.996
- Who is that guy?
- How do I know? I'm blind.

16:54.240 --> 16:57.835
We never settled our bet about who
was in the first light-beer commercial.

16:58.080 --> 17:01.789
Now, there must be somebody around
here that knows it was Billy Martin.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.752
There must be somebody here
that knows it was Bubba Smith.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.468
Wait a second.
I know just who to ask.

17:07.680 --> 17:08.829
Yo, barkeep.

17:17.640 --> 17:20.233
Joe Namath! Give me the camera!

17:21.880 --> 17:23.836
I'm blind.

17:25.240 --> 17:26.719
Joe...

17:27.720 --> 17:30.871
Joe, l... I've followed your career
from Alabama to Super Bowl III...

17:31.120 --> 17:34.590
...to that pain-ointment thing
you do now.

17:35.240 --> 17:36.958
Thanks.

17:37.160 --> 17:39.276
- You a shoe salesman?
- Yeah.

17:39.520 --> 17:41.351
Told you.

17:47.520 --> 17:50.114
You... You know, Joe,
I got just one question for you.

17:50.360 --> 17:53.750
Oh, I know, I know. Did I really believe
I'd win the Super Bowl?

17:54.000 --> 17:55.228
No, no.

17:55.440 --> 17:57.749
Who was in the first
light-beer commercial?

17:58.880 --> 18:00.199
Who cares?

18:01.200 --> 18:02.428
See, he said Bubba.

18:02.680 --> 18:04.033
It was Billy.

18:04.280 --> 18:06.589
I couldn't help
overhearing you two...

18:06.840 --> 18:10.879
...and after sucking down 20 cold ones
and a couple of warm ones...

18:11.120 --> 18:13.714
...my memory and my bladder
have been jogged.

18:13.960 --> 18:17.555
- It was Bubba Smith.
- Thank you.

18:19.360 --> 18:21.555
And that's the law talking.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.995
It was Billy Martin.
I know, I have it on tape.

18:24.240 --> 18:26.708
Bubba Smith. I know,
I don't know anything except that.

18:26.920 --> 18:28.273
- Billy Martin.
- Bubba Smith.

18:28.480 --> 18:30.198
- Billy Martin.
- Bubba Smith.

18:30.440 --> 18:32.749
- Billy Martin.
- Bubba Smith.

18:47.440 --> 18:49.874
I cannot believe
this actually worked.

18:50.120 --> 18:54.318
Mom was so convinced I was Dad,
she picked my pocket during the show.

18:55.040 --> 18:58.316
What are you complaining about?
At least you didn't get a hickey.

19:02.280 --> 19:04.077
- Billy Martin!
- Bubba Smith!

19:04.320 --> 19:06.072
- Billy Martin!
- Bubba Smith!

19:06.320 --> 19:10.950
Fellas, fellas, fellas.
Now, what are we fighting about?

19:11.200 --> 19:13.839
Here we are in the playground
of the gods.

19:14.080 --> 19:17.152
We got bimbos on the tube,
we got the law on the floor...

19:17.400 --> 19:19.630
...we got sugar on our nuts...

19:21.600 --> 19:23.591
...and we got our wives
at The Jeffersons.

19:23.840 --> 19:27.992
Who gives a rat's patoot who was
in the first light-beer commercial?

19:28.240 --> 19:30.993
- He's right!
- Yeah.

19:31.240 --> 19:35.153
Especially since we all know
it was Bubba Smith.

19:45.320 --> 19:48.471
Sometimes I wish I was back
in the game, where it's safe.

19:48.720 --> 19:50.199
You left the game?

19:50.440 --> 19:52.749
Two years after my knees did.

19:54.480 --> 19:56.675
Watch it, now! Watch it, now!

19:56.920 --> 19:59.070
Watch it, now!

20:00.360 --> 20:01.759
- Billy Martin!
- Bubba Smith!

20:02.000 --> 20:03.752
- Billy Martin!
- Bubba Smith!

20:08.200 --> 20:10.077
Jefferson, watch my camera!

20:11.000 --> 20:13.116
I got it, Al.

20:17.120 --> 20:20.908
You have the right to remain...

20:21.680 --> 20:23.830
...unconscious.

20:24.080 --> 20:27.277
I'll kill you. I'm gonna kill you.

20:46.160 --> 20:48.799
Well, did you learn your lesson?

20:49.040 --> 20:50.871
We have.

20:53.200 --> 20:56.715
It was a pretty good sports-trivia
bar-fight, though, hey, buddy?

20:57.280 --> 20:58.508
The best.

20:58.760 --> 21:00.398
Give me five.

21:02.280 --> 21:03.599
On second thought...

21:03.840 --> 21:06.035
...give me one five times.

21:10.560 --> 21:12.437
Well, boys,
we'll see you in about a week.

21:12.680 --> 21:15.433
We're going to see
the "Moving On Up" tour in Milwaukee.

21:15.680 --> 21:19.673
Yeah, we bought a "See America
With the Jeffersons" rail pass.

21:19.920 --> 21:22.559
It includes transportation,
theatre tickets...

21:22.800 --> 21:26.076
...and a box lunch with both Lionels.

21:27.640 --> 21:29.232
Can we get you anything
before we go?

21:29.480 --> 21:33.473
- As a matter of fact, my pain medicine...
- Gotta run. See you later.

21:35.360 --> 21:39.148
Oh, well, at least they're gone
and we've got a game on the tube.

21:44.320 --> 21:50.270
And now stay tuned for
our 24-hour Jeffersons marathon.

21:51.160 --> 21:55.119
Starting with
"The Jeffersons Go to Hawaii."

21:55.360 --> 21:57.510
Hey, now, kids. Hey, now!

21:57.760 --> 21:59.557
Change the channel here!

22:04.320 --> 22:08.233
Oh, my God.
It's Weezy in a bathing suit!
