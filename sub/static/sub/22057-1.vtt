Hey, no jumping.

No jumping!

00:40.325 --> 00:41.557
Seriously?

00:41.559 --> 00:43.392
Hey, boys, look, I know
you're having fun,

00:43.394 --> 00:45.962
but remember what I told
you about the rules?

00:48.366 --> 00:50.733
Okay, I will find
your parents.

00:51.703 --> 00:52.768
Excuse me.

00:52.770 --> 00:53.736
Hey, you Tani Rey?

00:53.738 --> 00:55.071
Yeah.
Commander Steve McGarrett.

00:55.073 --> 00:56.739
This is Danny Williams,
my partner.

00:56.741 --> 00:58.307
Five-O. You got a minute?

01:00.945 --> 01:02.578
Who is he?

01:02.580 --> 01:04.180
His name is Benny Lung.

01:04.182 --> 01:07.250
He was, uh, studying computer
engineering at Aloha State.

01:07.252 --> 01:10.253
Campus police found him
strangled to death last week.

01:10.255 --> 01:12.455
The only suspect
we have is a hacker

01:12.457 --> 01:14.290
who goes by the name
of MiZchief.

01:14.292 --> 01:16.125
And he spells it with a "Z"

01:16.127 --> 01:18.961
instead of an "S,"
like a rapper.

01:18.963 --> 01:19.996
Or maybe he's a moron.

01:19.998 --> 01:21.531
Whatever these guys
had going on,

01:21.533 --> 01:23.165
uh, went south.

01:24.402 --> 01:25.768
All right, well,
it's all very interesting.

01:25.770 --> 01:27.503
What does this
have to do with me?

01:27.505 --> 01:28.804
Well, we'd like you

01:28.806 --> 01:30.206
to help us find the guy.

01:30.208 --> 01:32.742
- Me?
- You.

01:32.744 --> 01:35.378
We believe this guy's been
operating on campus.

01:35.380 --> 01:36.879
We want you to go undercover.

01:36.881 --> 01:38.347
Identify MiZchief.

01:38.349 --> 01:40.716
As soon as you do, we'll, uh...
we'll take it from there.

01:40.718 --> 01:43.352
Look, I'm-I'm digging
the whole Jump Street thing--

01:43.354 --> 01:47.256
I-I really am--
but, um, I'm not your girl.

01:47.258 --> 01:48.491
Why not?

01:48.493 --> 01:49.892
Because I'm busy.

01:49.894 --> 01:50.960
Busy doing what?

01:50.962 --> 01:52.528
Getting, uh, harassed
by eight-year-olds?

01:52.530 --> 01:54.096
Come on,
what do you mean?

01:54.098 --> 01:55.364
Look, I gotta get
back to work.

01:55.366 --> 01:56.399
All right?
It's been ace.

01:56.401 --> 01:57.633
Actually, your, uh...

01:57.635 --> 01:59.268
your boss isn't
expecting you back today,

01:59.270 --> 02:01.904
so why don't you take a seat,
hang out a little bit?

02:05.810 --> 02:07.777
You guys are Five-O.

02:07.779 --> 02:10.613
You can have your pick
of anyone. Why me?

02:10.615 --> 02:13.649
Well, we need a cop
who doesn't think like a cop

02:13.651 --> 02:15.918
and, uh, you know,
who isn't afraid

02:15.920 --> 02:17.653
to break the rules a little bit.

02:17.655 --> 02:19.455
Or break somebody's nose.
Break somebody's nose.

02:19.457 --> 02:21.057
- Well, so you heard about that.
- Yeah, we did.

02:21.059 --> 02:22.091
- We did.
- Yep.

02:22.093 --> 02:23.593
We heard
that your training officer

02:23.595 --> 02:24.961
deserved it, so...
Yeah.

02:24.963 --> 02:27.897
Then you also heard that
I cheated on my written exam.

02:27.899 --> 02:29.565
That doesn't matter.
We're not looking for somebody

02:29.567 --> 02:31.634
who can recite code violation.

02:31.636 --> 02:34.503
Okay? And, uh,
your father passed away

02:34.505 --> 02:36.005
earlier that week, I understand.

02:36.007 --> 02:37.907
I'm sorry to bring
that up, but frankly,

02:37.909 --> 02:39.709
I'll take that as an excuse.

02:39.711 --> 02:41.377
Well, there are other things.

02:41.379 --> 02:43.346
I don't care about other things.

02:43.348 --> 02:46.449
What I care about is
that up until a month ago,

02:46.451 --> 02:49.752
when you washed out,
you were probably the best cadet

02:49.754 --> 02:51.520
the police academy
had seen in many years.

02:51.522 --> 02:53.756
Okay, so that-that's why
we came to talk to you.

02:53.758 --> 02:56.826
No, the academy was right
to kick me out.

02:56.828 --> 02:58.761
I shouldn't be a cop.

02:58.763 --> 03:01.464
The-the last thing
the HPD wants to see

03:01.466 --> 03:03.232
is me wearing a badge.

03:03.234 --> 03:05.635
Eight years ago, I sat across
from an ex-cop who said

03:05.637 --> 03:07.470
exactly the same thing
as you're saying now.

03:07.472 --> 03:09.505
His name was Chin Ho Kelly.

03:09.507 --> 03:11.007
Know where he is today?

03:11.009 --> 03:14.810
He's in San Francisco
running his own task force.

03:18.282 --> 03:19.582
I'm sorry.

03:19.584 --> 03:21.250

- Get a job.
- Get a life.

06:42.019 --> 06:43.586
You look at this place?
Look at this.

06:43.588 --> 06:44.854
We got tables everywhere.
Table here.

06:44.856 --> 06:46.355
Look at the light.
Right here, look.

06:46.357 --> 06:47.623
Boom, booths.
Nice light.

06:47.625 --> 06:49.792
Beautiful set of booths.
Over here, we got a bar.

06:49.794 --> 06:51.393
Obviously, we get
a liquor license.

06:51.395 --> 06:52.561
Look how big the kitchen is.

06:52.563 --> 06:54.663
Look at this kitchen. Huh?

06:54.665 --> 06:56.298
Got, uh, space for a brick oven.

06:56.300 --> 06:57.533
Right here-- big, big.

06:57.535 --> 06:59.068
Chef's table.
Big table.

06:59.070 --> 07:01.103
Boom. And lookit-- outside,

07:01.105 --> 07:02.338
metered parking everywhere.

07:02.340 --> 07:03.539
All right?
It's a fantastic neighborhood.

07:03.541 --> 07:05.040
Look at the light.
Look at everything.

07:05.042 --> 07:07.109
This place is-is perfect, no?

07:07.111 --> 07:09.812
It's very nice. I'm
just... I'm a little...

07:09.814 --> 07:12.214
I thought you said you were
gonna wait until you retire.

07:12.216 --> 07:14.550
I am, but this is now...
we start now, we get it going,

07:14.552 --> 07:16.385
and if we need help running it,
somebody helps us.

07:16.387 --> 07:17.586
Whoa, you keep saying "we."

07:17.588 --> 07:18.854
Who you talking about?
Who's the "we"? Us?

07:18.856 --> 07:20.256
We. Us. We.
I'm asking you

07:20.258 --> 07:21.857
to be my partner
in this restaurant.

07:21.859 --> 07:22.858
You want m-me?

07:22.860 --> 07:24.159
What, do I gotta
spell it out? Yes.

07:24.161 --> 07:25.227
In Steve's?

07:25.229 --> 07:27.596
In St... whatever we
decide to call it, yeah.

07:27.598 --> 07:29.198
Okay.

07:29.200 --> 07:31.700
This got something to do
with my radiation poisoning?

07:31.702 --> 07:33.569
Why would you say that?
Huh?

07:33.571 --> 07:35.738
Maybe you think
I'm gonna catch the big "C,"

07:35.740 --> 07:37.940
we start doing this now,
I retire from this.

07:37.942 --> 07:39.275
Is that right?

07:39.277 --> 07:41.110
No, it's not that.
Actually, what it really is,

07:41.112 --> 07:43.879
is that I want you to join me,
we'll do all the work together,

07:43.881 --> 07:45.981
and then you die
and I get all the profits.

07:45.983 --> 07:48.350
That's stupid. And I didn't...
that's not what I meant.

07:48.352 --> 07:50.119
No reason I'm doing this
except that it'd be fun.

07:50.121 --> 07:52.054
There's no guilt, no pity.
I want to have fun.

07:52.056 --> 07:53.756
We'll have fun. A restaurant
together would be fun, no?

07:53.758 --> 07:56.792
Huh? What are you
thinking about?

07:56.794 --> 07:58.260
I'm very flattered.

07:59.096 --> 08:00.496
You look it.
I'm very flattered.

08:00.498 --> 08:02.164
I'm trying to tell
you something here.

08:02.166 --> 08:03.866
I'm very flattered,
but this is...

08:03.868 --> 08:05.100
Steve's is your dream.

08:05.102 --> 08:06.302
It's not, uh...
it's not Steve's.

08:06.304 --> 08:07.436
You don't think
it'd be fun?

08:07.438 --> 08:08.871
Did I say it
wouldn't be fun?

08:08.873 --> 08:10.339
You don't think it'd be fun?
I didn't say...

08:10.341 --> 08:11.740
No, it would be fun.
We'd have...

08:11.742 --> 08:13.509
we'd have a terrible time
doing a restaurant together?

08:15.446 --> 08:17.479
McGarrett.

08:19.317 --> 08:21.216
What? When?

08:22.219 --> 08:23.786
Yeah, we're on the way.

08:28.459 --> 08:31.427
So he literally walked
out the front door.

08:31.429 --> 08:33.028
While the guards
watched helplessly,

08:33.030 --> 08:34.163
locked inside the prison.

08:34.164 --> 08:36.565
Well, I guess it beats
digging a tunnel.

08:36.567 --> 08:38.433
It's an escape worthy
of Houdini himself.

08:38.436 --> 08:40.501
I mean, if Houdini
had been a world-class hacker

08:40.504 --> 08:42.304
instead of a master illusionist.

08:42.306 --> 08:43.871
So you're saying he's
gone and we got nothing.

08:43.874 --> 08:44.974
Not really.

08:44.976 --> 08:46.342
Fortunately, we had

08:46.344 --> 08:47.977
a bit more luck
with the hacker.

08:47.979 --> 08:50.379
I was able to trace the point
of origin of the cyber attack.

08:50.381 --> 08:52.514
It was launched from
a Wi-Fi hotspot

08:52.516 --> 08:54.283
- at the Aloha State campus.
- Wait, wait, wait.

08:54.285 --> 08:56.085
Aloha State campus?
It could be the same guy

08:56.087 --> 08:57.219
we want for the strangling.

08:57.221 --> 08:58.687
This guy.

08:58.689 --> 09:00.923
Dean of students picked
him out of the footage,

09:00.925 --> 09:01.890
said he wasn't
registered there,

09:01.892 --> 09:03.292
so I ran him
through facial rec.

09:04.462 --> 09:06.295
Why does that name
look familiar?

09:06.297 --> 09:07.496
Aaron Wright.

09:07.498 --> 09:08.764
Wright?

09:08.766 --> 09:11.400
Four years ago, some
bastard named Ian Wright

09:11.402 --> 09:13.836
kidnapped my daughter.
Is this bird related to him?

09:13.838 --> 09:15.671
It's his brother.

09:17.575 --> 09:20.809
We need to figure out
what a hacker like this

09:20.811 --> 09:22.578
wants with a pyro like Duclair.

09:22.580 --> 09:24.913
The question is not
what I want with Duclair.

09:24.915 --> 09:27.116
What's Duclair going
to do now that he's escaped?

09:27.118 --> 09:29.385
- Jerry?
- I have no idea. Eric?

09:29.387 --> 09:31.220
Uh... uh, he's locked us
out of the system.

09:31.222 --> 09:34.289
What do you mean, he's locked us
out of the system?

09:34.291 --> 09:36.258
You have any idea
what you've done?

09:36.260 --> 09:37.259
Who you've set free?

09:37.261 --> 09:39.428
Yeah, I do.

09:40.564 --> 09:42.598
I've unleashed hell.

09:45.669 --> 09:47.403
Good luck.

10:45.591 --> 10:46.790
All right, all right.

10:46.792 --> 10:48.826
Just keep at it.
All right.

10:48.828 --> 10:50.127
Thanks.
That was Eric.

10:50.129 --> 10:51.495
He's still trying
to figure out

10:51.497 --> 10:52.863
how Aaron hacked
into our system.

10:52.865 --> 10:55.265
Take a look at this.
What do you got?

10:55.267 --> 10:58.836
It seems Aaron found his way
to Oahu two months ago.

10:58.838 --> 11:01.238
We know the name
he was traveling under?

11:02.074 --> 11:03.340
Here we go.

11:03.342 --> 11:04.375
Passenger manifest.

11:04.377 --> 11:05.509
One name doesn't check out.

11:05.511 --> 11:06.577
A Mick St. John.

11:06.579 --> 11:07.978
Well, that name's

11:07.980 --> 11:09.847
about as real
as a three-dollar bill.

11:09.849 --> 11:12.483
Okay, let's see if he booked
a room under that name.

11:16.022 --> 11:17.921
Crockett.

11:17.923 --> 11:19.790
White Tubbs.

11:19.792 --> 11:22.026
It's good to see you guys again.

11:22.928 --> 11:25.062
You could probably
put down the iron now.

11:25.064 --> 11:27.131
I mean, unless, you know,
you're gonna pull an Elvis

11:27.133 --> 11:28.565
and shoot the screen,
but I don't...

11:28.567 --> 11:30.034
I don't think
that would accomplish much

11:30.036 --> 11:31.201
at this point, now, would it?

11:31.203 --> 11:33.704
Oh, come on, guys.
Why the long faces?

11:33.706 --> 11:35.673
You didn't really think
I was gonna leave

11:35.675 --> 11:37.174
a digital footprint
like that, now, did you?

11:37.176 --> 11:39.476
What do you think, you're
dealing with an amateur here?

11:39.478 --> 11:41.712
If this is about your brother,
we didn't kill him.

11:41.714 --> 11:43.147
Yeah, I know.

11:43.149 --> 11:45.449
Wo Fat murdered him, and...

11:45.451 --> 11:47.451
Navy SEAL stole my revenge.

11:47.453 --> 11:48.986
Okay, so what's this about?

11:48.988 --> 11:50.587
I'm bored, guys.
Ask me something else.

11:50.589 --> 11:52.589
- Where's Duclair?
- Honestly,

11:52.591 --> 11:54.758
you two would have
a better chance finding Waldo.

11:54.760 --> 11:57.061
That pyro's got
a very busy schedule,

11:57.063 --> 12:01.131
and I don't think
it includes re-incarceration.

12:02.001 --> 12:03.600
Wait a minute.

12:03.602 --> 12:05.536
Is... is that even a word?

12:05.538 --> 12:07.705
Doesn't matter.
You guys get the idea.

12:07.707 --> 12:09.673
Oh, you might want to get that.

12:09.675 --> 12:10.708
Get what?

12:14.346 --> 12:15.746
That's clever.
How'd he do that?

12:17.983 --> 12:19.249
Jerry, talk to me.

12:19.251 --> 12:21.351
So we may have gotten
our first lead on Duclair.

12:21.353 --> 12:22.519
What do you got?

12:22.521 --> 12:24.021
Seems there's a fire
in progress.

12:24.023 --> 12:25.222
One casualty so far.

12:25.224 --> 12:26.490
Let me guess. Arson?

12:26.492 --> 12:27.791
It's too early to know for sure.

12:27.793 --> 12:29.460
HFD's still getting it
under control.

12:29.462 --> 12:31.428
Duclair's sprung out
of prison not six hours,

12:31.430 --> 12:32.930
already somebody's
dead in a fire.

12:32.932 --> 12:34.665
Can't be a coincidence.

12:43.809 --> 12:46.343
What did this poor guy do
to get himself burned alive?

12:46.345 --> 12:49.446
Actually, C.O.D. was
smoke inhalation,

12:49.448 --> 12:51.115
so he was dead
before immolation.

12:51.117 --> 12:52.950
But I'd say he definitely
made someone mad.

12:52.952 --> 12:54.017
Why do you say that?

12:54.019 --> 12:56.987
He's got two
perimortem GSWs--

12:56.989 --> 12:58.689
one in each kneecap.

12:58.691 --> 13:00.057
Probably so he
couldn't get away

13:00.059 --> 13:01.792
once the blaze was started.
- Yeah.

13:01.794 --> 13:04.461
So you went out there
and really pissed somebody off,

13:04.463 --> 13:06.296
didn't you, buddy,
with your crispy self?

13:06.298 --> 13:08.398
Question now is-- who?

13:08.400 --> 13:11.702
- So it was arson, no question.
- You sure?

13:11.704 --> 13:14.772
A can of paint thinner left
behind in plain sight.

13:14.774 --> 13:16.340
Stuff was splashed
everywhere.

13:16.342 --> 13:17.741
Real amateur hour.

13:17.743 --> 13:19.109
I don't think it was Duclair.

13:19.111 --> 13:21.044
Why, 'cause he got a little
crazy with the accelerant?

13:21.046 --> 13:21.621
Yeah.

13:21.645 --> 13:22.914
Guy's been sitting in
the joint for 12 months

13:22.915 --> 13:24.047
just dreaming
about doing this.

13:24.049 --> 13:26.116
He gets out, he gets
a little overexcited.

13:26.118 --> 13:27.918
This... this is Duclair's life,
you understand?

13:27.920 --> 13:29.787
It's-it's like an art to him.

13:29.789 --> 13:32.489
And like every artist,
he has a specific style,

13:32.491 --> 13:33.557
a-a signature.

13:33.559 --> 13:35.025
This... this isn't it.

13:35.027 --> 13:36.894
I see. So, he gets out today,
this happens,

13:36.896 --> 13:38.428
and he's got nothing
to do with it?

13:38.430 --> 13:39.596
I didn't say that. I just...

13:39.598 --> 13:41.131
I just don't think
he lit the match.

13:41.133 --> 13:42.332
Well, how was he involved?

13:42.334 --> 13:43.767
I got an idea about that.

13:43.769 --> 13:46.537
Noelani just I.D.'d
the body the fire department

13:46.539 --> 13:48.906
dragged out here.
This is Anthony Brent,

13:48.908 --> 13:51.508
two-time convicted
arsonist.

13:51.510 --> 13:53.076
Now, Noelani
also told me

13:53.078 --> 13:55.445
that the guy had a
bullet in both kneecaps.

13:55.447 --> 13:57.181
I think I can tell you why.

13:57.183 --> 14:00.584
According to HPD, Brent
was the number-one suspect

14:00.586 --> 14:03.520
in a residence fire that
happened a week ago.

14:03.522 --> 14:05.856
The residence belonged
to Randy Tao.

14:05.858 --> 14:07.157
Wait, Randy... Randy Tao.

14:07.159 --> 14:08.725
The drug trafficker Randy Tao?

14:08.727 --> 14:10.961
That's the one. He was
using the place as a lab.

14:10.963 --> 14:12.696
He lost a ton of product--

14:12.698 --> 14:14.731
not to mention one
of his top lieutenants--

14:14.733 --> 14:15.999
in that fire.

14:16.001 --> 14:17.267
So this is payback.

14:17.269 --> 14:19.069
That's right.
But here's how I think

14:19.071 --> 14:20.470
Duclair fits into this picture.

14:20.472 --> 14:21.939
What if Tao sprung Duclair

14:21.941 --> 14:24.508
out of prison not to
torch this place,

14:24.510 --> 14:26.743
but to find out who burned
down his dope house?

14:26.745 --> 14:28.712
Like an arson
investigator.

14:28.714 --> 14:29.880
To identify this guy?

14:29.882 --> 14:31.448
- Yeah.
- Right.

14:31.450 --> 14:32.683
Duclair's an expert
on the subject.

14:32.685 --> 14:34.218
- Who better?
- Of course.

14:34.220 --> 14:35.786
We need to go talk to Randy Tao

14:35.788 --> 14:38.288
because, if anybody knows
where Duclair is, it's him.

14:39.859 --> 14:42.793
Randy Tao, Five-O.
Open the door.

14:49.301 --> 14:50.734
Clear.

14:51.937 --> 14:54.638
Clear. Clear.

14:54.640 --> 14:56.707
Think we just
found Randy Tao.

14:56.709 --> 14:58.876
And, presumably,
his sons.

14:58.878 --> 15:00.611
Looks like nothing else
has been touched.

15:02.448 --> 15:03.680
Controlled fire
like this--

15:03.682 --> 15:05.115
this is Duclair,
I'm telling you.

15:05.117 --> 15:06.516
Dumb bastards.

15:06.518 --> 15:09.219
They didn't have any idea
what they were setting free.

15:09.221 --> 15:10.854
He's got a taste of it
again now.

15:10.856 --> 15:13.123
He's not gonna stop
until we put him down.

15:24.706 --> 15:25.839
Tao gets his revenge

15:25.841 --> 15:27.407
on the guy who burned
down his building,

15:27.409 --> 15:29.676
and then Duclair roasts him
and his boys in a luau.

15:29.678 --> 15:31.177
It's an interesting way
to say thank you

15:31.179 --> 15:32.546
for getting the guy
out of prison.

15:32.548 --> 15:33.713
Duclair's not stupid.

15:33.715 --> 15:34.681
Right? Check it out.

15:34.683 --> 15:36.249
He knew that we
would get onto Tao

15:36.251 --> 15:38.184
and that Tao would
eventually send us back

15:38.186 --> 15:40.086
in his direction,
so he gets preemptive.

15:40.088 --> 15:42.155
Takes Tao and his boys out
before that can happen.

15:42.157 --> 15:43.435
Yeah, you know, you play
with fire, you get burned, man.

15:43.459 --> 15:44.659
Really?

15:44.660 --> 15:46.493
You were both thinking it.

15:46.495 --> 15:47.794
No, I was not thinking it.

15:47.796 --> 15:49.129
I was not.
I wasn't thinking it, either.

15:49.131 --> 15:50.897
I wasn't...
Jerry, what do you got?

15:50.899 --> 15:52.532
A money trail from Tao
to Aaron Wright

15:52.534 --> 15:54.601
for breaking Duclair
out of prison.

15:54.603 --> 15:56.803
The cash landed
in a holding company which also

15:56.805 --> 15:58.505
paid for a rental in Ewa Beach.

15:58.507 --> 16:00.040
Yeah, send me the address.

16:01.009 --> 16:02.242
<i>Whoa, whoa!</i>

16:02.244 --> 16:04.544
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, listen.

16:04.546 --> 16:07.213
Just, whatever you want,
I can help you with this.

16:07.215 --> 16:08.982
Okay? I got a lot of money.

16:08.984 --> 16:11.818
All right? You can... you
can have it all, okay?

16:11.820 --> 16:13.553
Oh, oh!

16:14.690 --> 16:16.156
Come on, man.

16:16.158 --> 16:18.024
Come on. Please?

16:21.630 --> 16:23.330
Come on, man.

16:23.332 --> 16:24.931
Come on.

16:37.212 --> 16:38.845
Am I interrupting something?

16:50.459 --> 16:52.192
I don't know who you are,

16:52.194 --> 16:54.427
but you're gonna
look good on fire.

16:54.429 --> 16:57.197
Wow, that is so sweet
of you to say, you psycho.

17:23.125 --> 17:25.392
Hands!

17:28.597 --> 17:29.529
Rey, you all right?

17:29.531 --> 17:30.597
Yeah.

17:30.599 --> 17:31.598
Yeah.

17:31.600 --> 17:33.166
What are you
doing here, huh?

17:33.168 --> 17:34.834
I changed my mind.
You changed your mind?

17:34.836 --> 17:36.069
You weren't gonna tell us?

17:36.838 --> 17:38.138
Step back.

17:40.075 --> 17:41.508
Lou?
He's running!

17:41.510 --> 17:43.543
Okay, Lou, stay with Wright.

17:44.546 --> 17:46.179
I got him.

17:46.181 --> 17:48.114
Knock yourself out.

17:50.952 --> 17:53.186
So, my daughter...

17:53.188 --> 17:56.790
is still having nightmares
about being kidnapped.

17:57.793 --> 17:59.025
That was my brother.

17:59.027 --> 18:00.727
All right?
That wasn't me.

18:05.434 --> 18:09.302
I sure hope you're the last one
in the Wright family.

18:18.814 --> 18:20.146
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

18:20.148 --> 18:21.347
What the hell were
you doing in there?

18:21.349 --> 18:23.249
You told me to identify MiZchief
and report back.

18:23.251 --> 18:25.051
Go back to the house.

18:25.053 --> 18:26.953
That's funny.

18:26.955 --> 18:27.987
What's funny?

18:27.989 --> 18:29.322
Unpredictable,
stubborn, crazy.

18:29.324 --> 18:31.257
She's the female you.

18:55.117 --> 18:57.317
Tell me you have an
antitheft device.

18:58.286 --> 19:01.087
Guys, I'm tracking
that Mustang now.

19:04.893 --> 19:06.092
I got him.

19:07.195 --> 19:09.429
All right, Duke's got HPD
getting a helicopter up.

19:09.431 --> 19:11.631
Does this thing go any faster?

19:12.934 --> 19:14.134
Danny?

19:17.405 --> 19:19.405
Guys, you got him.
That street he just turned on

19:19.407 --> 19:20.707
dead-ends into the woods.

19:29.251 --> 19:29.896
There he is right there.

19:29.920 --> 19:31.719
I got him, I got him.
Jerry, we got him.

19:31.720 --> 19:34.120
He's on foot. Connect
to a satellite in this area.

19:58.246 --> 20:01.214
So, uh, what... what about me?

20:01.216 --> 20:03.049
Why are you here?

20:03.051 --> 20:04.350
You know what?
I don't care.

20:04.352 --> 20:06.152
You've gone far enough.

20:06.154 --> 20:08.721
There are thousands
of acres of land.

20:08.723 --> 20:10.657
You're gonna need
all the help you can get.

20:10.659 --> 20:11.858
She's right.

20:16.364 --> 20:17.797
You're not giving her a gun,
right?

20:17.799 --> 20:18.898
Um, I know
we don't have

20:18.900 --> 20:20.266
a lot of time,
but maybe it's worth

20:20.268 --> 20:21.501
a little, short
conversation.

20:21.503 --> 20:24.404
What's the first rule
of carrying a firearm?

20:24.406 --> 20:25.605
Don't give her a gun.

20:25.607 --> 20:27.574
Don't shoot the good guys.

20:27.576 --> 20:28.775
That's good enough.

21:03.778 --> 21:04.811
What? What is it?

21:04.813 --> 21:06.212
Steve?

21:16.391 --> 21:18.124
He started a fire.

21:22.264 --> 21:24.464
Yeah, he's a pyro.
That's what he does.

21:24.466 --> 21:26.766
He's using it
as a cover to escape.

21:53.193 --> 21:55.460
All right, we
gotta split up.

21:55.462 --> 21:57.129
Create a bottleneck,
catch this guy

21:57.131 --> 21:58.530
before we all
end up barbecue.

21:58.532 --> 22:00.298
Be careful.
Good thinking.

22:01.301 --> 22:03.235
<i>All residents of Oahu</i>

22:03.237 --> 22:07.205
<i>are being urged to stay indoors</i>
<i>with windows closed,</i>

22:07.207 --> 22:08.907
<i>as firefighters</i>
<i>desperately battle</i>

22:08.909 --> 22:10.409
<i>to contain the blaze</i>

22:10.411 --> 22:12.978
rapidly moving
through the Ewa Forest Reserve.

22:12.980 --> 22:16.748
The inferno, which has just
knocked out another cell tower,

22:16.750 --> 22:19.551
is now causing
the evacuation of nearby homes,

22:19.553 --> 22:22.788
as well as the local
elementary school.

22:23.757 --> 22:25.590
Oh, that's a big fire.

22:25.592 --> 22:27.325
Yeah.

22:28.562 --> 22:29.995
Let them finish.

22:29.997 --> 22:32.097
Let's move over
to the fire trucks.

22:32.099 --> 22:34.633
Those guys got a fight
ahead of them.

22:34.635 --> 22:36.334
They're gonna be hungry.

22:36.336 --> 22:38.336
Yeah, you got it.

22:44.978 --> 22:46.745
Drop it.

22:46.747 --> 22:47.946
It's over, Duclair.

22:47.948 --> 22:49.881
You want to live,
we need to get out of here.

23:56.817 --> 23:58.016
Duclair!

23:58.018 --> 23:59.784
Get your hands up!

23:59.786 --> 24:01.019
Hands up, Duclair!

24:01.021 --> 24:03.822
Get your hands up!
I got this.

24:08.695 --> 24:10.061
Hey, cowgirl.

24:10.063 --> 24:11.596
What are you doing?

24:12.099 --> 24:13.632
Lower your weap...

24:17.504 --> 24:18.870
Oh, okay.
All right, that's cool.

24:18.872 --> 24:20.038
That's cool. Good shot.

24:20.040 --> 24:21.907
What did I just say?

24:21.909 --> 24:23.508
Look, maybe you would
have won-- I don't know.

24:23.510 --> 24:25.844
I'm done with this weenie roast.
Can we get out of here?

24:25.846 --> 24:27.445
Get on your feet.
Can we keep her?

24:27.447 --> 24:28.513
Come on. Let's go.

24:28.515 --> 24:29.714
Let's go. Come on.

24:29.716 --> 24:31.316
Come on, move.

24:34.021 --> 24:35.353
Jerry?

24:36.757 --> 24:37.856
Jerry!

24:39.026 --> 24:40.559
I'm getting nothing
on the comm, Steve.

24:40.561 --> 24:42.327
We gotta go back.
Stop. We gotta go back.

24:42.329 --> 24:43.862
Go back where? What
are you talking about?

24:43.864 --> 24:45.163
Look how thick the
smoke's getting.

24:45.165 --> 24:46.231
We're walking right into
the heart of the fire.

24:46.233 --> 24:47.632
I don't know how
to break this to you,

24:47.634 --> 24:48.700
but the fire
is everywhere, Steve.

24:49.903 --> 24:51.336
All right,
you're the fire expert.

24:51.338 --> 24:52.804
What do we do now?
Die.

24:52.806 --> 24:54.839
You first.
We're going this way.

24:54.841 --> 24:56.474
Danny, let's go this way.

24:56.476 --> 24:58.610
Maybe we can miss
the worst of it.

24:58.612 --> 25:01.246
Find a clearing,
flag a chopper. Come on.

25:24.638 --> 25:25.937
Move! Move!

25:25.939 --> 25:27.672
Out of here,
out of here. Go!

25:27.674 --> 25:29.074
Move! Keep going.

25:29.076 --> 25:31.476
Move, move, move!
Come on!

25:35.048 --> 25:37.115
All right, Steve,
this is not working.

25:41.788 --> 25:43.054
Don't worry.

25:43.056 --> 25:46.458
You'll die of inhalation
before it ever touches you.

25:49.329 --> 25:51.329
I'm starting
to like you.

25:55.269 --> 25:58.136
Guys. Guys, they got
a cabin here. Come on.

26:04.911 --> 26:06.611
Come on.

26:11.785 --> 26:13.418
All right.

26:13.420 --> 26:14.819
Grover, you put him
in that chair.

26:14.821 --> 26:16.454
Secure him, okay?
I got it.

26:16.456 --> 26:17.455
You guys, get towels,

26:17.457 --> 26:18.890
pillow cases,
whatever you can find.

26:18.892 --> 26:21.459
We gotta fill these cracks,
keep the smoke out, fresh O2 in.

26:21.461 --> 26:22.994
He's down.
Weapon.

26:23.563 --> 26:25.297
Jerry?

26:26.166 --> 26:27.932
Jerry, come in. Jerry.

26:27.934 --> 26:29.801
Jerry, come on.

26:29.803 --> 26:31.169
Steve.
Yeah?

26:31.171 --> 26:33.338
How much time do we have?

26:33.340 --> 26:35.473
Five people, less than
a thousand square feet.

26:35.475 --> 26:38.510
We're gonna run out of O2
before we burn to death.

26:38.512 --> 26:40.378
You could've lied, you know?

26:41.581 --> 26:43.682
We're gonna get out of here.

26:44.718 --> 26:46.084
How?

26:46.086 --> 26:47.319
What's your plan?

26:47.321 --> 26:49.521
This place has got to be
crawling with rescue.

26:49.523 --> 26:52.057
I'm gonna get out there,
I'm gonna find one of them.

26:53.160 --> 26:56.061
Out there, back in the fire?
That's your plan?

26:56.063 --> 26:58.330
That's my plan-- or I can stay
in here and we all die.

26:58.332 --> 27:00.865
I'm gonna run downhill
into the wind as much as I can.

27:00.867 --> 27:02.100
Sounds so stupid.

27:02.102 --> 27:03.201
It sounds just as stupid

27:03.203 --> 27:04.769
as what you
just said before.

27:04.771 --> 27:07.739
That's what I got.

27:11.712 --> 27:14.479
If this thing starts
coming in, you all stay low

27:14.481 --> 27:15.480
and you stay wet.

27:15.482 --> 27:16.715
- All right?
- All right.

27:16.717 --> 27:17.882
Do me a favor-- uh...

27:17.884 --> 27:19.150
stay alive.

28:44.300 --> 28:45.700
How are we on that AC?

28:45.702 --> 28:47.368
So far, so good.

28:49.539 --> 28:51.505
Well?

28:51.507 --> 28:54.542
Ice bucket challenge? That's a
little 2014, don't you think?

28:54.544 --> 28:56.110
Uh-huh. I, uh...
I'm-I'm genuinely sorry

28:56.112 --> 28:57.812
that I got you involved
in all this.

28:57.814 --> 28:59.680
You didn't tell me to
go to Wright's place.

28:59.682 --> 29:02.350
I did that on my own.
I got myself into this.

29:02.352 --> 29:03.484
That's true,
but I'm still sorry.

29:03.486 --> 29:04.752
Well, you should be.

29:04.754 --> 29:06.087
Thanks.

29:11.394 --> 29:13.327
You guys are
wasting your time.

29:13.329 --> 29:15.563
Nobody asked you.

29:15.565 --> 29:17.765
Oh, I'm gonna enjoy
watching you burn.

29:17.767 --> 29:19.467
Oh, we can get this party
started right now.

29:19.469 --> 29:20.835
How about I go find
some accelerant

29:20.837 --> 29:23.237
and light that ass up,
and we can watch you burn.

29:25.875 --> 29:28.142
McGarrett isn't gonna
make it far, you know.

29:28.144 --> 29:30.611
The smoke out there is a mix

29:30.613 --> 29:33.114
of carbon monoxide
and fine particles

29:33.116 --> 29:35.716
of burning trees and plant life.

29:35.718 --> 29:37.618
Those particles are small.

29:37.620 --> 29:40.421
Less than two and a
half micrometers.

29:40.423 --> 29:42.990
But trust me,
they're deadly.

29:42.992 --> 29:47.161
They can find their way into
the deepest parts of your lungs.

29:47.163 --> 29:49.029
<i>First comes the coughing.</i>

29:50.733 --> 29:53.334
<i>Your throat turns to sandpaper.</i>

29:53.336 --> 29:55.002
<i>Then the headaches.</i>

29:55.004 --> 29:56.370
<i>Fatigue.</i>

29:56.372 --> 29:58.205
<i>Shortness of breath.</i>

29:58.207 --> 29:59.407
Smoke is like a poison

29:59.409 --> 30:01.175
infecting your blood
through your lungs

30:01.177 --> 30:02.843
and attacking the cells.

30:02.845 --> 30:05.513
<i>Fire uncontrolled</i>

30:05.515 --> 30:09.116
is one of Mother Nature's
most elegant weapons.

30:09.118 --> 30:10.284
That's it.

30:11.721 --> 30:13.287
Oh!

30:13.289 --> 30:14.488
That's an elegant weapon, too!

30:14.490 --> 30:16.090
Nobody likes a Chatty Cathy.

30:17.260 --> 30:18.726
What, you want
another wood facial?

30:18.728 --> 30:21.929
You better point them eyes
someplace else.

30:25.601 --> 30:27.067
Hey!

30:28.905 --> 30:30.304
Hey!

30:35.545 --> 30:37.278
Hey!

30:38.548 --> 30:40.915
Hey!

30:40.917 --> 30:43.918
Jerry. Come in, Jerry.

30:43.920 --> 30:46.153
Steve?

30:46.155 --> 30:47.555
Steve, you copy?

30:47.557 --> 30:49.256
Get anything?

30:49.258 --> 30:50.925
No, nothing.

30:52.395 --> 30:54.995
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey! Hey!

31:03.506 --> 31:05.139
He's just gonna
die out there.

31:05.141 --> 31:06.507
Good.
We can only hope.

31:06.509 --> 31:07.575
Back inside.

31:09.512 --> 31:11.312
Get down on the floor.

31:21.057 --> 31:23.691
Hey, Danny, um...

31:24.527 --> 31:26.460
Do me a favor--
save your oxygen, okay?

31:26.462 --> 31:28.262
Just let him say
what he wants to say.

31:28.264 --> 31:30.304
I think I'm pretty sure
I know what he wants to say.

31:31.234 --> 31:33.067
Hey.

31:34.737 --> 31:36.437
Me, too, brother.

31:36.439 --> 31:37.872
Me, too.

31:57.360 --> 31:59.026
Danny!

32:04.166 --> 32:05.933
I got a visual. I got a visual.

32:12.074 --> 32:13.440
Hi, Steve.

32:13.442 --> 32:15.075
Hey, pal. Ready to go home?

32:15.077 --> 32:17.711
Hell yeah,
we want to go home!

32:18.448 --> 32:20.115
Throw down the rope.
I'll send Tani up first.

32:20.117 --> 32:21.616
No, no. I'm not
going up first.

32:21.618 --> 32:22.491
By the time I get up
there, the fire...

32:22.515 --> 32:23.753
You don't have a...

32:23.754 --> 32:25.053
You don't have a choice, okay?

32:25.055 --> 32:26.354
Come on.
Look, she's right.

32:26.356 --> 32:27.282
There's a good chance

32:27.283 --> 32:29.417
one of us might not
make it, Danny.

32:29.418 --> 32:30.850
No, we're all gonna make it.

32:30.852 --> 32:31.851
How?

32:31.853 --> 32:34.421
Good question. How?

32:36.058 --> 32:39.359
Okay.
What is this?

32:39.361 --> 32:40.694
No, we can't all
go down together.

32:40.696 --> 32:41.928
The wind's gonna tangle us up.

32:41.930 --> 32:43.196
It's never gonna work.
No, no, that's...

32:43.198 --> 32:44.698
that's not what
he's got in mind.

32:44.700 --> 32:46.332
I need you to take those cables

32:46.334 --> 32:49.135
and attach them together
underneath the cabin.

32:49.137 --> 32:51.705
Attach them together,
and then get inside the cabin.

32:51.707 --> 32:52.872
You hear me?

32:52.874 --> 32:54.441
This is crazy.

32:54.443 --> 32:57.043
Nah! This is McGarrett.

32:57.045 --> 32:58.144
Attach those cables. Go.

33:20.469 --> 33:22.602
Grab hold of something.

33:22.604 --> 33:23.670
Danny, talk to me.

33:23.672 --> 33:25.205
All right,
Steve, we're in.

33:25.207 --> 33:26.740
Everybody needs to hold on.

34:35.877 --> 34:38.178
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are clear.

34:38.179 --> 34:40.580
And headed home.

34:47.188 --> 34:49.222
<i>At this time,</i>
<i>firefighters have managed</i>

34:49.224 --> 34:51.257
<i>to contain 80% of the wildfire,</i>

34:51.259 --> 34:52.958
<i>with an anticipated</i>
<i>100% containment...</i>

34:52.960 --> 34:55.929
<i>An HPD spokesperson</i>
<i>has confirmed one casualty.</i>

34:55.931 --> 34:58.097
<i>As reported earlier,</i>
<i>the body of a male</i>

34:58.099 --> 35:01.835
<i>has now been identified as</i>
<i>escaped convict Jason Duclair.</i>

35:01.837 --> 35:03.570
<i>Duclair was</i>
<i>serving a life sentence</i>

35:03.572 --> 35:05.371
<i>for arson</i>
<i>and multiple homicides</i>

35:05.373 --> 35:07.340
<i>prior to his escape.</i>

35:27.362 --> 35:29.395
Hi.
Hi.

35:29.397 --> 35:31.231
This is a nice place.

35:32.567 --> 35:34.434
Not really, but thanks.

35:34.436 --> 35:36.269
No, it's, uh...

35:36.271 --> 35:38.404
it's good. I like it.
It's very nice.

35:38.406 --> 35:41.040
You're such a bad liar.

35:41.042 --> 35:42.475
People tell me I need
to be more positive,

35:42.477 --> 35:43.443
so I'm working on it, you know?

35:43.445 --> 35:45.445
Oh. Nice try.

35:45.447 --> 35:46.746
Thank you.

35:46.748 --> 35:50.683
So, uh, Steve, uh...
Steve called you, right?

35:51.753 --> 35:53.453
And?

35:54.356 --> 35:56.022
I'm thinking about it.

35:56.024 --> 35:58.391
That's good. At least
you're not packing your bags,

35:58.393 --> 35:59.726
trying to join
the witness protection program.

35:59.728 --> 36:02.562
Is it really that bad?

36:02.564 --> 36:03.696
No, it's not that bad.

36:03.698 --> 36:05.031
It's never boring.

36:05.033 --> 36:07.333
McGarrett doesn't seem
like the boring type.

36:07.335 --> 36:09.802
No, no.
He's definitely not that.

36:09.804 --> 36:13.006
I've seen him do a lot crazier
things than yesterday.

36:13.008 --> 36:15.608
God.
Yeah.

36:15.610 --> 36:19.212
He will definitely, um...
drive you crazy,

36:19.214 --> 36:20.446
frustrate you.

36:20.448 --> 36:22.215
But, uh...

36:22.217 --> 36:24.450
if you're with him,
there is nobody out there

36:24.452 --> 36:26.519
you'd rather have
having your back than him.

36:26.521 --> 36:28.855
You're...
you're an Army brat, right?

36:28.857 --> 36:30.356
Mmm, yeah.

36:30.358 --> 36:32.325
Seven bases in 15 years.

36:32.327 --> 36:33.960
Oahu was the last one.

36:33.962 --> 36:36.129
So, then you know it's
very difficult to find a...

36:36.131 --> 36:38.264
somebody you can count on--
a good friend, right?

36:39.100 --> 36:40.266
Very.

36:40.268 --> 36:41.634
Well, that's the
difference between Steve

36:41.636 --> 36:43.102
and the rest
of the planet Earth.

36:43.104 --> 36:46.472
He will be there for you...
no matter what.

36:46.474 --> 36:47.874
When I first met him,

36:47.876 --> 36:50.710
I, uh... I-I almost shot him.

36:50.712 --> 36:52.378
And then, uh,

36:52.380 --> 36:55.081
he asked me to be his partner,
and I-I felt like punching him

36:55.083 --> 36:57.016
in the face.

36:57.018 --> 37:00.887
But his timing was...
was spot-on, you know.

37:00.889 --> 37:03.523
That's the thing about Steve.
He has this ability

37:03.525 --> 37:07.160
to show up in your life
right when you need him.

37:07.162 --> 37:08.861
That's how it was
for me, uh...

37:08.863 --> 37:10.897
Kono, Chin,

37:10.899 --> 37:12.632
Lou, Jerry.

37:12.634 --> 37:14.300
Can't explain.

37:14.302 --> 37:15.735
You-you remind me a lot

37:15.737 --> 37:16.970
of Kono, by the way.

37:16.972 --> 37:18.137
That's a compliment.

37:18.139 --> 37:19.639
Where is she?

37:19.641 --> 37:23.242
She is on the mainland, uh,
working with a task force

37:23.244 --> 37:25.945
shutting down
a sex trafficking network.

37:28.717 --> 37:30.616
Anyway, um...

37:30.618 --> 37:32.685
things are changing, and, uh...

37:32.687 --> 37:36.322
uh, we would all like you
to be a part of that.

37:58.813 --> 38:00.346
Hey, wait in the hall.

38:00.348 --> 38:02.048
I'll be right out.

38:15.864 --> 38:18.564
Let me guess.

38:18.566 --> 38:20.066
Your daughter?

38:20.068 --> 38:21.934
Yeah.

38:23.004 --> 38:24.904
She's talking about going
to college out of town,

38:24.906 --> 38:26.272
so I brought her
down here

38:26.274 --> 38:27.874
to see the brother of the man

38:27.876 --> 38:29.475
who kidnapped her
three years ago

38:29.477 --> 38:31.811
and made her life a living hell.

38:32.914 --> 38:35.548
She needed to see
that there are still

38:35.550 --> 38:38.084
real live monsters in the world

38:38.086 --> 38:40.586
and that as her father,

38:40.588 --> 38:43.289
it's my job to protect her.

38:52.467 --> 38:55.101
No cameras in here.

38:55.103 --> 38:59.038
You better be glad
they caught you first.

39:09.818 --> 39:11.717
Samantha, this guy...

39:11.719 --> 39:13.019
Hey...

39:17.625 --> 39:20.593
I'd do anything
to keep you safe.

39:32.841 --> 39:34.540
Hey.

39:38.279 --> 39:39.645
I, uh...

39:40.582 --> 39:41.981
...got your message.

39:41.983 --> 39:43.883
Yeah.

39:43.885 --> 39:45.751
Hey. How's, uh...
how's Tani?

39:45.753 --> 39:47.086
She all right?

39:47.088 --> 39:48.287
Yeah, she's good.

39:48.289 --> 39:50.022
She, uh, says she feels
like she smoked

39:50.024 --> 39:51.691
a thousand packs
of cigarettes.

39:51.693 --> 39:52.859
She's, uh... she's fine.

39:52.861 --> 39:55.228
I think she's gotta get
her head examined, though.

39:55.230 --> 39:56.462
What are you talking about?

39:56.464 --> 39:58.498
She's coming back tomorrow.

39:58.500 --> 40:00.199
That's great news.

40:00.201 --> 40:01.501
She is? That's great.

40:01.503 --> 40:02.735
We need the help.

40:02.737 --> 40:04.670
How'd you get in here?

40:04.672 --> 40:07.473
Oh, we need to talk about
the lock on the back door.

40:07.475 --> 40:09.075
First thing we
gotta fix.

40:09.077 --> 40:10.343
It's a joke.

40:10.345 --> 40:12.912
First thing <i>we</i> gotta fix?

40:12.914 --> 40:15.248
Yeah, you and me-- we.

40:16.184 --> 40:17.450
This is for you.

40:17.452 --> 40:18.618
It's a, uh...

40:18.620 --> 40:21.087
this is a Hawaii
commercial lease agreement.

40:21.089 --> 40:23.589
Been signed by
yours truly

40:23.591 --> 40:26.125
and dated--
today's date.

40:26.127 --> 40:27.593
You're not messing with me?

40:27.595 --> 40:29.996
No, you wore me down,
like you always do.

40:29.998 --> 40:31.130
That's because
that's my superpower.

40:31.132 --> 40:32.999
I know it is.
I know it is.

40:33.001 --> 40:34.634
But you're right. You're
right about this place.

40:34.636 --> 40:37.770
Uh... it's special.

40:37.772 --> 40:39.138
It's special. I've been
thinking about it a lot.

40:39.140 --> 40:40.439
It's got great bones.

40:40.441 --> 40:41.641
But it's gonna
need a lot of TLC.

40:41.643 --> 40:42.742
There's gonna be
a lot of work.

40:42.744 --> 40:44.277
You understand
that, right?

40:44.279 --> 40:45.611
Listen, that's what you said
about Charlie's remodel.

40:45.613 --> 40:46.679
We did that right, didn't we?

40:46.681 --> 40:48.080
Dude, we killed it.

40:48.082 --> 40:50.883
We killed it to death, but
this is different, Danny.

40:50.885 --> 40:53.052
This is, uh... this is
pretty complicated.

40:53.054 --> 40:54.453
I agree. I agree, partner.
Okay.

40:54.455 --> 40:56.489
All right, partner.
I agree.

40:56.491 --> 40:58.424
We're gonna be great, huh?
Good.

40:58.426 --> 41:01.627
Hey, um, just a...

41:01.629 --> 41:03.029
couple things.

41:03.031 --> 41:04.430
You-you-you believe in this?

41:04.432 --> 41:06.232
You're not... it's just not
that I wore you down

41:06.234 --> 41:07.333
and bugged you enough about it?

41:07.335 --> 41:08.301
I mean, you actually believe

41:08.303 --> 41:09.502
that this thing
could work, right?

41:09.504 --> 41:12.305
Old-school Italian
in the middle of Chinatown.

41:12.307 --> 41:14.173
It's a horrendous idea. No.

41:14.175 --> 41:16.442
But I don't know anything
about restaurants.

41:16.444 --> 41:17.643
I believe in you.

41:17.645 --> 41:18.844
I believe in us.

41:18.846 --> 41:20.213
That's all that matters, right?

41:20.215 --> 41:21.514
That's right.
Are we clear?

41:21.516 --> 41:23.249
I guess so.

41:25.353 --> 41:26.619
It's gonna be fun.

41:26.621 --> 41:28.287
Yeah.

41:28.289 --> 41:30.623
It's gonna be fun.

41:30.625 --> 41:32.258
<i>I'm in charge. You know that.</i>

41:32.260 --> 41:33.726
<i>Nope.</i>
