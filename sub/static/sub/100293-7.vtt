00:22.129 --> 00:23.809
Thief!

00:25.049 --> 00:26.968
- Let me back in.
- How did you get out there?

00:26.969 --> 00:28.808
- Seeing a friend.
- I'll chop your hand off!

00:28.809 --> 00:31.608
I say friend. We're not that
close. Please, let me back in.

00:31.609 --> 00:34.529
Please, let me back in. Fast.

00:39.929 --> 00:42.328
You can't keep stealing
from merchants in the souk.

00:42.329 --> 00:44.168
They know where you're from.

00:44.169 --> 00:48.046
You tell me creating happiness is
important to my mental wellbeing.

00:48.929 --> 00:50.488
Game like this makes me happy.

00:52.375 --> 00:54.679
Time to go back in your
room. It'll be dark soon.

00:55.129 --> 00:57.528
Have you taken precautions?
Have you told everyone?

00:58.406 --> 00:58.928
Tahira...

00:59.500 --> 01:00.820
We have to keep everyone safe.

01:00.845 --> 01:03.328
- Nothing is going to happen, Tahira.
- Of course it is.

01:03.329 --> 01:06.329
I told you to tell them. I told
the doctors, I told all of you.

01:07.689 --> 01:08.968
They're real.

01:09.633 --> 01:11.609
I understand they seem real to you.

01:13.085 --> 01:15.288
You need to rest. Sleep will help.

01:15.289 --> 01:18.169
<i>Sleep is when they'll come.</i>

01:19.689 --> 01:21.769
I can feel them coming.

01:23.089 --> 01:24.769
They'll be here tonight.

01:25.822 --> 01:27.542
Rest well, Tahira.

01:45.301 --> 01:46.941
Maryam! Maryam!

01:47.714 --> 01:48.814
Over here.

01:49.673 --> 01:52.258
- I told you to lock the doors.
- We don't do that.

01:52.369 --> 01:54.449
Get everyone out.

01:58.929 --> 02:00.321
Oh, no.

02:02.529 --> 02:03.968
I tried to warn you.

02:07.329 --> 02:09.488
Don't struggle.

02:09.489 --> 02:11.408
They like it more when you struggle.

03:23.969 --> 03:26.048
<i>- Here we are! Sheffield.
- Is it the right day?</i>

03:26.049 --> 03:27.768
- It's the right day.
- In the right year?

03:27.769 --> 03:29.248
The day you asked, in
the year that you asked,

03:29.249 --> 03:32.208
at the time that you
asked... you are home.

03:32.209 --> 03:34.808
Ah. Everyone meet back here?

03:34.809 --> 03:36.248
Tomorrow lunchtime?

03:36.249 --> 03:38.088
Yeah, yeah. What you gonna do?

03:38.089 --> 03:40.048
Me? Oh, you know...

03:40.049 --> 03:42.048
Very busy.

03:42.049 --> 03:44.408
Busy, busy. I've got maintenance.

03:44.409 --> 03:46.128
Correspondence.

03:46.129 --> 03:48.489
- Correspondence
about maintenance.

03:49.689 --> 03:52.448
Oh, okay, not the exact right time,

03:52.449 --> 03:54.448
77 minutes out. Late.

03:54.449 --> 03:56.529
What?

03:57.729 --> 03:59.608
You sure you're gonna
be alright on your own?

03:59.609 --> 04:03.088
Ah, you know... finally
a bit of peace and quiet.

04:09.513 --> 04:10.848
I could always...

04:11.645 --> 04:12.779
Oh, nah.

04:14.489 --> 04:17.009
Maybe I'll just nip straight
to tomorrow lunchtime.

04:22.644 --> 04:24.404
What was that?

04:34.129 --> 04:36.128
Location for that noise.

04:36.129 --> 04:37.609
Aleppo?

04:38.609 --> 04:39.809
I've got time.

04:44.649 --> 04:46.208
<i>Sorry, sorry.</i>

04:46.209 --> 04:48.888
Am I late? It is the
right day, isn't it?

04:48.889 --> 04:50.728
Have you been waiting
long? Am I really late?

04:50.729 --> 04:53.688
Yes, yes, yes and yes.

04:53.689 --> 04:55.648
Mum and Dad left hours ago.

04:55.649 --> 04:57.528
Whitby for the night.

04:57.529 --> 04:59.129
Did you cook?

05:00.249 --> 05:01.929
Can you cook now?

05:04.089 --> 05:05.729
Hi, loser.

05:08.449 --> 05:10.089
Hey, no-mark.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.048
What you doing here, man?

05:21.049 --> 05:22.808
I got your messages, didn't I?

05:22.809 --> 05:25.008
- It's been months.
- Yeah.

05:25.009 --> 05:26.489
Me phone's been playing up.

05:29.089 --> 05:31.288
- So... so are you back?
- Yeah.

05:31.289 --> 05:32.688
Sort of.

05:32.689 --> 05:34.488
Not really. Just a few hours.

05:34.489 --> 05:36.729
I bought chips. You
gonna let me in or what?

05:37.809 --> 05:39.289
It's not a good time.

05:41.169 --> 05:43.408
I got chips, though!

05:45.409 --> 05:46.689
Come on.

05:57.089 --> 06:01.608
And that, gentlemen,
is a full... house.

06:01.609 --> 06:02.688
What?

06:02.689 --> 06:05.768
Well, I've been practising,
ain't I? On me travels. Hey?

06:05.769 --> 06:07.328
Gotta say, it's great to see you lads.

06:07.329 --> 06:09.128
Don't sound like I've
been missing much, though.

06:09.129 --> 06:12.128
Nothing at all. I'd
rather be on cruises, like you.

06:12.129 --> 06:15.688
Let me tell you, Gabe, those boats,
mate, they are lovely. Very calm.

06:15.689 --> 06:17.528
And how's your health now, Gra? Alright?

06:17.529 --> 06:19.328
Good, Freddy boy, thanks. Very good.

06:19.329 --> 06:21.408
How you coping?

06:21.409 --> 06:23.008
Without Grace?

06:23.009 --> 06:25.488
Well, I have to, don't I? You know?

06:25.489 --> 06:27.728
Travelling helps, mate, don't it?

06:27.729 --> 06:30.008
Stops me getting stuck in the past.

06:39.529 --> 06:41.968
Aleppo.

06:41.969 --> 06:44.488
1380. Welcome to Syria.

06:44.489 --> 06:46.529
Now... Oh...

06:47.929 --> 06:49.529
They're not here, are they?

06:50.649 --> 06:52.329
"Bimaristan".

06:53.689 --> 06:55.208
That means 'sick place'.

06:55.209 --> 06:59.128
This must be one of the
oldest hospitals in the world.

06:59.129 --> 07:02.328
Of course, Islamic physicians
are known for the enlightened way

07:02.329 --> 07:04.449
they treated people with
mental health problems.

07:06.849 --> 07:08.968
What happened here?

07:08.969 --> 07:11.368
You guys go this way... oh!

07:11.369 --> 07:13.768
Who am I supposed to share all
the interesting stuff with?!

07:13.769 --> 07:16.008
Is someone there?

07:16.009 --> 07:18.329
Friendly visitors... visitor.

07:19.329 --> 07:22.009
Where are you?
I'm coming to say hello.

07:23.449 --> 07:25.649
I'm the Doctor.

07:28.129 --> 07:30.249
I'm here to help!

07:32.809 --> 07:35.168
- Stay away!
- It's alright.

07:35.169 --> 07:38.208
- You're safe, I promise.
- No, they took everyone.

07:38.209 --> 07:41.088
- What happened here?
- You have to get out!

07:41.089 --> 07:42.328
Why?

07:42.329 --> 07:44.568
Because there's one still here.

07:59.489 --> 08:01.648
What are you?

08:01.649 --> 08:02.688
Leave her alone!

08:04.929 --> 08:06.369
Stay here!

08:07.609 --> 08:09.728
Gone. That was fast.

08:14.409 --> 08:15.889
Nothing.

08:17.489 --> 08:18.929
Nothing at all.

08:21.169 --> 08:23.608
Right, lads, ready? Here we go.

08:23.609 --> 08:26.648
Fastest dealer in South Yorkshire.

08:41.129 --> 08:42.769
Can you see?

08:44.489 --> 08:46.529
Can you see it?

08:48.129 --> 08:49.809
I'm trapped.

08:50.929 --> 08:52.649
This is what he did to me.

08:53.849 --> 08:55.728
Help me, Graham.

08:55.729 --> 08:57.209
He's close.

09:00.489 --> 09:02.328
I think you lost count.

09:08.009 --> 09:09.688
Goes past one.

09:09.689 --> 09:11.209
Goes past two.

09:12.529 --> 09:13.888
It's a screamer!

09:13.889 --> 09:16.568
Top bins! Final seconds.

09:16.569 --> 09:18.448
He's got it. He's a legend.

09:18.449 --> 09:20.328
Ryan Sinclair, FIFA legend.

09:20.329 --> 09:23.089
I've never lost it.
Oh! I've still got it.

09:26.529 --> 09:28.209
I'll make tea.

09:37.849 --> 09:40.448
The place is normally
spotless. This ain't you.

09:40.449 --> 09:42.568
Mate, you ain't been around,
so don't tell me what I am.

09:42.569 --> 09:43.889
Alright.

09:47.169 --> 09:49.529
Mate, sorry for not
answering your messages...

09:53.369 --> 09:55.369
... but you ain't yourself.

09:56.929 --> 10:00.528
I'm just... finding things
difficult at the moment.

10:00.529 --> 10:03.149
- Have you spoken to anyone about it?
- No! And I'm not going to.

10:04.689 --> 10:06.249
Alright.

10:09.249 --> 10:10.729
There's something else.

10:12.329 --> 10:14.829
- Promise you won't laugh at me.
- I can't promise that, can I?

10:23.209 --> 10:24.729
Last few days...

10:26.089 --> 10:27.649
... I've been having nightmares.

10:28.849 --> 10:30.529
Dark, messed-up stuff.

10:32.009 --> 10:34.689
And there's this... bloke in them.

10:35.889 --> 10:39.728
He keeps recurring, like
he's... watching my dreams.

10:39.729 --> 10:41.408
Waiting in the dark.

10:41.409 --> 10:44.129
- Ah, that's creepy.
- That's not the mad bit.

10:46.249 --> 10:48.249
For the past few days...

10:49.289 --> 10:50.769
... I've seen him.

10:52.249 --> 10:54.929
At night, outside the
flat, across the hall...

10:57.369 --> 10:58.928
... in my room.

10:58.929 --> 11:01.128
The guy that's in your
dreams is in your room?

11:01.129 --> 11:02.488
I knew you'd laugh.

11:02.489 --> 11:04.088
Look at me.

11:04.089 --> 11:05.689
I'm not laughing.

11:07.489 --> 11:10.408
Mate, I've seen some weird
things while I've been away.

11:10.409 --> 11:12.609
Things you wouldn't
believe were possible.

11:16.569 --> 11:18.289
Would you kip here tonight?

11:19.369 --> 11:22.928
So, can you say where
you've been... where they sent you?

11:22.929 --> 11:25.968
Madagascar, California, Hong Kong.

11:25.969 --> 11:28.768
- Gloucester.
- Oh, they had a thing in Gloucester.

11:28.769 --> 11:32.048
Dad was going on about it.
Something to do with Russians.

11:32.049 --> 11:34.369
Had nought to do with Russians.

11:35.729 --> 11:37.849
- How's the new job?
- Sacked.

11:38.889 --> 11:40.248
- Sonya!
- What?

11:40.249 --> 11:41.528
That's the third time!

11:41.529 --> 11:44.368
People are really annoying
and they hate being told that.

11:44.369 --> 11:46.288
I'm just not cut out
for customer services.

11:46.289 --> 11:47.809
No kidding.

11:49.889 --> 11:51.329
Sonya...

11:54.889 --> 11:57.168
... we can stop doing this,

11:57.169 --> 11:59.168
stop marking it.

11:59.169 --> 12:01.369
I thought it was a good thing.

12:03.249 --> 12:04.848
Yeah.

12:04.849 --> 12:07.808
No, I just don't know whether
an anniversary dinner...

12:07.809 --> 12:09.369
I still think about it.

12:11.489 --> 12:12.849
Do you?

12:15.889 --> 12:17.929
I dream about it sometimes.

12:21.489 --> 12:23.408
Sofa movie after?

12:23.409 --> 12:26.048
What? So you can fall
asleep halfway through?

12:26.049 --> 12:28.048
I do not do that.

12:33.489 --> 12:35.449
Idiot.

12:36.489 --> 12:38.888
Hi.

12:38.889 --> 12:41.248
<i>I-I didn't know who to call.</i>

12:41.249 --> 12:43.089
<i>We need help.</i>

13:23.129 --> 13:26.169
Who are you?
What you doing here?

14:22.209 --> 14:24.249
What you doing?
Hey?

14:29.729 --> 14:30.768
Tibo!

14:30.769 --> 14:33.888
What is your name?
- Tahira.

14:33.889 --> 14:36.288
Have you seen those
creatures before, Tahira?

14:36.289 --> 14:37.808
Not really.

14:37.809 --> 14:39.248
Who are you?

14:39.249 --> 14:41.208
I've never seen you here before, Doctor.

14:41.209 --> 14:44.409
Oh, my brief is quite wide-ranging.

14:45.529 --> 14:48.408
No signs of those creatures
outside the bimaristan.

14:48.409 --> 14:51.608
So, deliberately targeting a
hospital of vulnerable people.

14:51.609 --> 14:53.728
The place is silent.
Where is everyone else?

14:53.729 --> 14:56.848
- How many people were here?
- Maybe 10 or 12 patients.

14:56.849 --> 14:58.688
I'm really sorry...

14:58.689 --> 15:01.048
... but I think those creatures
must have taken them.

15:01.049 --> 15:03.248
- Taken them where?
- I have no idea.

15:03.249 --> 15:05.529
And... why have they left you behind?

15:06.569 --> 15:07.890
How long have you been here?

15:07.891 --> 15:10.848
If it's not a personal
question, which it is.

15:10.849 --> 15:12.369
A few weeks.

15:13.369 --> 15:14.968
I've travelled a long way.

15:14.969 --> 15:16.769
Seen a lot of things I wish I hadn't.

15:19.129 --> 15:21.248
My family were killed when I were seven.

15:21.249 --> 15:22.728
I ran.

15:22.729 --> 15:23.768
Aleppo was safety for me,

15:23.769 --> 15:25.888
they let me in here
because I wasn't doing well.

15:25.889 --> 15:28.928
I promise to keep you
safe. We will work this out.

15:28.929 --> 15:31.648
Ah! Really sorry.

15:31.649 --> 15:34.488
Message device. Someone's
trying to get in touch.

15:34.489 --> 15:38.288
Just in 14th century Syria. Is
it lunchtime tomorrow already?!

15:38.289 --> 15:39.408
I need your help.

15:39.409 --> 15:41.048
- Me mate's been taken.
- What?

15:41.049 --> 15:42.968
Wait!
Another call.

15:42.969 --> 15:44.368
- Yaz?
- Doctor.

15:44.369 --> 15:45.928
There was a figure in our flat.

15:45.929 --> 15:47.568
- Oh, hold on.

15:47.569 --> 15:49.448
Ah. Graham?

15:49.449 --> 15:52.288
Hey, Doc, I keep seeing
these images of planets,

15:52.289 --> 15:54.048
like they're being
projected into my head.

15:54.049 --> 15:57.528
Hmm. Hold on. Call merge.

15:57.529 --> 15:58.968
I'm coming to get you all now.

15:58.969 --> 16:00.728
And I'm bringing my new friend, Tahira.

16:00.729 --> 16:03.088
Who?
- I'll be there in a sec.

16:07.809 --> 16:09.968
It did leave something behind.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.728
I knew it. This'll tell us something.

16:12.729 --> 16:15.088
Come on, I'll explain on the way.

16:15.089 --> 16:17.289
And it might just blow your mind.

16:24.129 --> 16:26.968
Tahira, This is Ryan, Graham and Yaz.

16:26.969 --> 16:28.648
Hi.

16:28.649 --> 16:31.688
Tahira is from Aleppo in 1380.

16:31.689 --> 16:33.208
I've explained about the TARDIS

16:33.209 --> 16:35.608
and the fact that you're
from 700 years in the future.

16:35.609 --> 16:37.328
I'm really not ready for today.

16:38.609 --> 16:40.528
No. Don't tell me that,
'cause you're wrong.

16:40.529 --> 16:42.248
Well, I'm telling you, you are.

16:42.249 --> 16:44.808
- Who's she arguing with?
- The TARDIS.

16:44.809 --> 16:46.728
Because it's telling
me, quite defiantly,

16:46.729 --> 16:49.168
that these two strands
of fur do not exist,

16:49.169 --> 16:50.728
when they're right there!

16:50.729 --> 16:54.448
Those creatures that we saw
aren't registered in its database.

16:54.449 --> 16:57.208
<i>They've never existed.
Will never exist.</i>

16:57.209 --> 16:58.568
Except they must,

16:58.569 --> 17:00.528
<i>'cause if they don't
exist, if they can't exist,</i>

17:00.529 --> 17:02.088
where did they come from?

17:02.089 --> 17:03.528
And how?

17:03.529 --> 17:05.127
Tell me what happened to your mate.

17:05.128 --> 17:08.728
Some guy was in his room...
don't know how he got in there...

17:08.729 --> 17:11.328
and it was like his fingers
were detached from his hand,

17:11.329 --> 17:12.808
connected to Tibo's ear,

17:12.809 --> 17:14.647
and it was draining something from him.

17:14.648 --> 17:16.008
What did he look like?

17:16.009 --> 17:18.407
He was bald and... tattooed head.

17:18.409 --> 17:20.728
Whoa. Same bloke that was in the flat.

17:20.729 --> 17:22.048
And you.

17:22.049 --> 17:23.728
The psychic incursion in your head.

17:23.729 --> 17:25.647
Someone trying to communicate with you.

17:25.648 --> 17:27.083
Yeah.
But it was a woman.

17:27.084 --> 17:29.288
She was trapped inside this, um...

17:29.289 --> 17:31.888
I don't know. I couldn't
make head nor tail of it.

17:31.889 --> 17:34.248
But then I saw these... um...

17:34.249 --> 17:35.768
... like, planets.

17:35.769 --> 17:38.688
They were burning, like she
was connected to 'em somehow.

17:38.689 --> 17:41.008
Someone's targeting us.

17:41.009 --> 17:43.528
Do you have any idea where
those planets might be?

17:43.529 --> 17:45.528
You get me an A to Z of the universe,

17:45.529 --> 17:48.088
and I'll be able to stick
my finger straight...

17:48.089 --> 17:49.808
Um, no. I've got no idea.

17:49.809 --> 17:51.688
Right, then. Better idea.

17:51.689 --> 17:53.769
TARDIS telepathic circuits.

17:54.769 --> 17:56.528
- Doc...
- Stop fidgeting, will you?

17:57.569 --> 17:58.569
- Doc...

17:58.570 --> 18:00.088
Ow! I don't like it.
Are you sure it's safe?

18:00.089 --> 18:01.408
You trust me, don't you?

18:01.409 --> 18:03.329
- Have I got to answer that?
- Oi!

18:04.369 --> 18:05.968
- Is it gonna hurt?
- No.

18:05.969 --> 18:07.088
Probably not.

18:07.089 --> 18:08.728
Maybe. Yeah.

18:08.729 --> 18:10.168
- Ready?
- No!

18:10.169 --> 18:11.969
- Focus on the image.
- Oh...

18:16.449 --> 18:17.928
Doc!

18:17.929 --> 18:19.288
Ouch.

18:20.729 --> 18:22.689
We found something. We're moving.

18:24.929 --> 18:26.448
But where?

18:40.649 --> 18:43.009
Deep space. Distant future.

18:44.409 --> 18:45.889
Is this what you saw?

18:46.889 --> 18:48.369
No. Nothing like this.

18:50.489 --> 18:52.368
Then why here?

18:52.369 --> 18:54.529
What did the telepathic
circuits lock onto?

18:55.689 --> 18:57.288
If they were
hooked into your mind,

18:57.289 --> 18:59.088
no wonder we're
somewhere dark and weird.

19:00.489 --> 19:02.608
Do you even know where we are?

19:02.609 --> 19:04.928
Half a galaxy past the Geskin Straits.

19:04.929 --> 19:06.688
Very little out here.

19:06.689 --> 19:08.688
No civilisations left by now.

19:08.689 --> 19:10.688
It doesn't feel like a ship, though.

19:10.689 --> 19:14.648
And we're in geostationary orbit,
and that would be deliberate.

19:14.649 --> 19:16.248
So, why here?

19:16.249 --> 19:18.408
Are we underground?
Is that why it's so dark?

19:19.769 --> 19:22.808
The Doctor reckons we're in
a building, among the stars.

19:22.809 --> 19:24.448
We've come a long way from home.

19:24.449 --> 19:27.208
That's impossible. Nobody
can travel across the stars.

19:27.209 --> 19:28.888
Unless you're the Doctor.

19:28.889 --> 19:31.168
She's basically the
definition of impossible.

19:32.969 --> 19:34.889
Oh! Control hub.

19:36.449 --> 19:37.928
Operator-activated.

19:37.929 --> 19:40.768
GRAHAM: Oh. Now, you've
got something there, Doc.

19:40.769 --> 19:42.328
Yeah. But what?

19:42.329 --> 19:43.569
There... look.

19:44.569 --> 19:46.528
That is exactly what I saw.

19:46.529 --> 19:48.208
Those two objects.

19:48.209 --> 19:50.648
This must be a monitor platform.

19:50.649 --> 19:53.568
Observing events in this
part of the solar system.

19:53.569 --> 19:55.768
What are they... like, planets?

19:55.769 --> 19:57.648
Looks like they're
falling into each other.

19:57.649 --> 20:00.288
Colliding. About to destroy each other.

20:00.289 --> 20:02.648
It's an extinction event.

20:02.649 --> 20:04.888
But... they're not colliding,
and they should be.

20:04.889 --> 20:06.849
What's stopping the final collapse?

20:08.729 --> 20:10.209
Let's take a little zoom in.

20:12.289 --> 20:15.568
Whoa! There's something there,
between those planets.

20:15.569 --> 20:17.049
What sort of something?

20:18.929 --> 20:20.848
Good question.

20:20.849 --> 20:23.891
Whoa!
The engineering required

20:23.892 --> 20:26.528
to create that and keep it in place...

20:26.529 --> 20:30.488
Bravo. Whoever built that,
round of applause from me.

20:30.489 --> 20:33.648
Doc, can... can you
magnify it? Like, zoom in?

20:33.649 --> 20:36.169
- Why?
- Well, I think there's more to see.

20:38.049 --> 20:40.408
A tiny geo orb locked in place.

20:40.409 --> 20:42.129
Is there someone in there?

20:44.489 --> 20:46.689
Are you here? Is it you?

20:47.689 --> 20:49.848
Th... that's it.

20:49.849 --> 20:52.249
She's trapped. That's...
that's what I saw!

20:53.489 --> 20:55.408
Doc, we... we gotta help her out.

20:55.409 --> 20:56.729
Please.

20:58.169 --> 21:01.408
Hey! Have you seen this?

21:01.409 --> 21:03.289
This whole section
is covered in fingers.

21:04.849 --> 21:07.449
What? Covered in fingers?

21:12.289 --> 21:14.169
And there's a signal coming from them.

21:15.169 --> 21:17.728
Broadcasting it to
that orb, to that girl.

21:17.729 --> 21:19.328
<i>Trapped.</i>

21:19.329 --> 21:22.088
A psychic signal fed by all this.

21:22.089 --> 21:23.769
But what is it?

21:28.769 --> 21:31.169
This place has so many secrets to yield.

21:33.649 --> 21:35.168
RYAN: What do you
reckon you've got there?

21:35.169 --> 21:38.568
This tech is powering this platform,

21:38.569 --> 21:40.408
powering that orb,

21:40.409 --> 21:43.529
keeping it in place
between those two planets.

21:44.649 --> 21:47.928
And at its heart, a
quantum fluctuation lock,

21:47.929 --> 21:51.248
a sequence of changing combinations,

21:51.249 --> 21:55.808
hundreds of billions of
combinations every millisecond,

21:55.809 --> 21:57.729
which would mean that orb...

21:59.249 --> 22:01.968
It's a prison, and
she's locked in there,

22:01.969 --> 22:03.929
fed by that signal.

22:05.689 --> 22:07.449
Signal of what, though?

22:09.369 --> 22:10.889
Where's Tahira?

22:24.809 --> 22:26.289
Maryam.

22:32.449 --> 22:34.449
Do you recognise them?

22:37.169 --> 22:38.968
The Chagaskas.

22:38.969 --> 22:42.889
Your worst fears, my creativity.

22:43.849 --> 22:47.049
There she is. Oi!
Freakhands! Get away from her!

22:48.489 --> 22:50.888
Plus, you can release all
of these people right now.

22:50.889 --> 22:53.649
And don't you ever come sneaking
back into my family's flat.

22:55.129 --> 22:56.409
Oh, that's not good.

23:17.289 --> 23:18.769
Do it right this time.

23:20.849 --> 23:22.889
I won't be calling anyone.

23:24.329 --> 23:26.128
No point.

23:26.129 --> 23:28.168
You're weak.

23:28.169 --> 23:30.009
You run.

23:31.809 --> 23:33.649
Nobody's coming, Yaz.

23:45.849 --> 23:47.569
You're alone in the dark.

23:52.049 --> 23:53.369
Oh, no...

23:57.609 --> 23:59.969
Sonya!

24:31.409 --> 24:34.089
- Tibo?
- Where you been, man?

24:36.009 --> 24:38.049
We waited for you.
You said you'd be back.

24:39.329 --> 24:40.848
How long you been waiting?

24:40.849 --> 24:42.809
Our whole lives.

24:44.769 --> 24:46.288
What's with all the fire?

24:46.289 --> 24:48.648
The place is burning.

24:48.649 --> 24:51.609
- What place?
- Earth.

24:53.329 --> 24:55.529
And you weren't here.

24:57.209 --> 24:58.849
I thought we were mates.

25:21.649 --> 25:23.529
Why am I hooked up to this?

25:31.049 --> 25:32.528
Grace...

25:32.529 --> 25:34.569
I'm sorry to tell you, Mr O'Brien...

25:35.569 --> 25:37.488
... your cancer's returned.

25:37.489 --> 25:39.248
Wh...

25:39.249 --> 25:41.008
Well, no, no. No, that can't be right.

25:41.009 --> 25:42.848
I've... I've had a check-up.

25:42.849 --> 25:44.408
I, um...

25:44.409 --> 25:46.128
Anyway, you're not my doctor.

25:46.129 --> 25:48.689
This time, it's very aggressive.

25:50.609 --> 25:53.368
Well... how long have I got?

25:53.369 --> 25:55.249
A couple of hours.

25:57.769 --> 25:59.688
Why didn't you...

25:59.689 --> 26:01.329
... save me?

26:03.089 --> 26:05.248
I'm sorry.

26:05.249 --> 26:07.049
Let me... let me try again.

26:10.369 --> 26:14.008
Now, for most people, a
quantum flux lock is breakable.

26:14.009 --> 26:17.489
100 billion combinations
every millisecond.

26:18.489 --> 26:19.808
But I've got an app for that.

26:19.809 --> 26:21.248
One sonic...

26:21.249 --> 26:23.568
... connected to the
calculating power...

26:23.569 --> 26:25.089
... of one TARDIS.

26:26.089 --> 26:27.729
Shouldn't take too long, so...

26:28.889 --> 26:31.609
And I'm talking to myself again,
which means the others aren't here.

26:32.969 --> 26:34.529
Hello, Doctor.

26:39.049 --> 26:41.208
I've watched you...

26:41.209 --> 26:43.569
... stumbling round this universe.

26:45.969 --> 26:47.569
I presume this is all your doing.

26:49.529 --> 26:53.168
Who's that girl in the orb?
And where are my friends?

26:53.169 --> 26:54.929
Who are you?

26:56.049 --> 26:57.649
I go by many names.

26:58.769 --> 27:01.008
My preferred...

27:01.009 --> 27:03.488
... my original...

27:03.489 --> 27:05.449
... is Zellin.

27:06.649 --> 27:07.729
No.

27:10.529 --> 27:12.408
Zellin's a mythical name,

27:12.409 --> 27:14.128
way beyond this universe.

27:14.129 --> 27:16.848
Zellin was thought to be a god.

27:16.849 --> 27:18.329
I blush.

27:20.529 --> 27:21.888
It can't be.

27:21.889 --> 27:25.608
We immortals need our games, Doctor.

27:25.609 --> 27:30.329
Eternity is long and we
are cursed to see it all.

27:31.849 --> 27:33.649
The Eternals have their games...

27:34.809 --> 27:37.888
... the Guardians have
their power struggles.

27:37.889 --> 27:45.208
For me, this dimension is a
beautiful board for a game.

27:45.209 --> 27:47.608
The Toymaker would approve.

27:47.609 --> 27:52.208
And I do like this
form... it's so... small.

27:52.209 --> 27:57.089
To exist within molecules
and atoms is fascinating.

27:58.169 --> 28:00.128
I can shape them,

28:00.129 --> 28:02.128
regrow,

28:02.129 --> 28:05.648
mould my form,

28:05.649 --> 28:08.768
to provoke fear from humans

28:08.769 --> 28:13.409
as I extract nightmares from
the scared and vulnerable.

28:15.089 --> 28:16.848
Now, that...

28:16.849 --> 28:18.769
- ... is a good game.
- Wait.

28:21.129 --> 28:23.368
Are you transmitting nightmares?

28:24.889 --> 28:27.970
Taking nightmares from humans
and forcing them into the mind

28:27.971 --> 28:30.051
of a girl you've
trapped between planets?

28:30.809 --> 28:32.928
I've seen many races, Doctor,

28:32.929 --> 28:36.209
and the humans are
infinitely fascinating.

28:37.209 --> 28:38.768
Infinitely...

28:38.769 --> 28:40.449
... pathetic.

28:41.449 --> 28:43.049
But, of course, you know that.

28:44.129 --> 28:46.568
We share the same obsession.

28:46.569 --> 28:48.488
We're not the same.

28:48.489 --> 28:49.609
No.

28:50.889 --> 28:53.009
You are so much lesser.

28:55.249 --> 28:57.169
You know the best part of humanity?

28:58.169 --> 29:01.449
The thing that truly sets them apart?

29:02.809 --> 29:07.969
The cruelty of their own minds
directed towards themselves.

29:09.409 --> 29:11.209
The doubt. The fear.

29:13.329 --> 29:16.448
The endless voices telling themselves

29:16.449 --> 29:19.128
they're incapable and unworthy.

29:22.169 --> 29:24.329
Such an exquisite animal.

29:25.649 --> 29:28.128
Built-in pain.

29:28.129 --> 29:30.768
And the repositories of that pain?

29:30.769 --> 29:32.488
The nightmares.

29:36.329 --> 29:38.328
I presume that's your doing, Doctor.

29:38.329 --> 29:39.808
Always interfering.

29:39.809 --> 29:42.648
I've watched you blunder into this.

29:42.649 --> 29:44.528
"Blundering"... top of my CV,

29:44.529 --> 29:46.208
alongside "Plays well with others"

29:46.209 --> 29:48.528
and "Excellent tap-dancer in a crisis".

29:48.529 --> 29:50.169
Almost clever.

29:51.249 --> 29:53.249
But not quite clever enough.

29:54.409 --> 29:55.888
You sure about that?

29:55.889 --> 29:59.049
'Cause, look... your
prisoner, she's free.

30:00.289 --> 30:03.249
I used your own technology against you.

30:04.249 --> 30:06.248
No, Doctor.

30:06.249 --> 30:09.968
I used your instincts against you.

30:09.969 --> 30:11.169
What?

30:12.889 --> 30:18.168
I made the Chagaskas, targeted
the humans, to entice you here.

30:18.169 --> 30:22.568
I needed someone from this realm
to break a lock from this realm.

30:22.569 --> 30:24.249
Only one would do.

30:25.249 --> 30:26.609
You.

30:28.249 --> 30:29.409
No.

30:31.649 --> 30:34.168
You did find the right answer,

30:34.169 --> 30:36.969
but you weren't asking
the right question, so...

30:39.289 --> 30:40.729
My freedom.

30:43.809 --> 30:46.808
This platform isn't my technology.

30:46.809 --> 30:48.688
I didn't make this prison.

30:48.689 --> 30:51.848
She was always the more powerful of us.

30:51.849 --> 30:54.168
The more dangerous.

30:54.169 --> 30:55.969
That's why they imprisoned her.

30:57.409 --> 30:59.168
I just...

30:59.169 --> 31:01.529
... ride in her slipstream.

31:08.409 --> 31:10.288
Release?

31:10.289 --> 31:12.049
After all this time?

31:14.649 --> 31:16.368
I don't understand.

31:16.369 --> 31:17.809
Let me make you.

31:21.369 --> 31:25.048
<i>Two creatures from another
realm descended into a universe</i>

31:25.049 --> 31:27.129
<i>where they were worshipped as gods.</i>

31:28.169 --> 31:31.928
<i>They saw two planets and laid a wager...</i>

31:31.929 --> 31:34.969
<i>which of them could bring a
planet to destruction first?</i>

31:35.969 --> 31:37.448
<i>The gods set to their game,</i>

31:37.449 --> 31:40.168
<i>sowing chaos through the populations.</i>

31:40.169 --> 31:43.608
<i>Wars began, between species,</i>

31:43.609 --> 31:45.609
<i>then between the planets themselves.</i>

31:46.649 --> 31:49.128
<i>The gods delighted in the carnage.</i>

31:49.129 --> 31:50.609
<i>It passed the time.</i>

31:51.609 --> 31:55.368
<i>But slowly, the inhabitants
of the worlds grew wise,</i>

31:55.369 --> 31:58.248
<i>realised what these
creatures had done to them.</i>

31:58.249 --> 32:02.168
<i>They unified, and fought back
against their so-called gods.</i>

32:02.169 --> 32:05.728
<i>They set their own planets
into a collision course</i>

32:05.729 --> 32:09.368
<i>and at the heart of the
collision they laid a prison.</i>

32:09.369 --> 32:13.929
<i>They trapped one creature
between the planets for eternity.</i>

32:14.969 --> 32:17.768
<i>The other fled, vowing to return</i>

32:17.769 --> 32:19.889
<i>to release his eternal partner.</i>

32:21.169 --> 32:23.408
<i>Wake up, Doctor.</i>

32:23.409 --> 32:25.368
Welcome back.

32:25.369 --> 32:27.289
I hope you understand now.

32:29.129 --> 32:32.208
I wasn't torturing her with nightmares.

32:32.209 --> 32:36.648
I was feeding her what
she needed to stay sane...

32:36.649 --> 32:40.088
the pain of others.

32:40.089 --> 32:43.528
But even gods need a
helping hand, Doctor.

32:43.529 --> 32:45.329
Thank you.

32:47.009 --> 32:50.809
You won't feel a thing
when this all burns.

32:51.969 --> 32:53.768
Yes, they will.

32:53.769 --> 32:56.049
Yes.

32:57.449 --> 32:59.329
Where now?

33:00.729 --> 33:04.688
All those nightmares... I loved them.

33:04.689 --> 33:06.448
Humans?

33:06.449 --> 33:08.009
Earth.

33:09.489 --> 33:10.808
Let's take them all.

33:10.809 --> 33:12.729
Yes.

33:17.809 --> 33:19.649
Oh, come on.

33:55.529 --> 33:58.208
What do you think it
feels like for them...

33:58.209 --> 34:04.168
to be such... tiny, ephemeral
flashes of existence?

34:10.409 --> 34:12.449
They feel so much.

34:13.728 --> 34:15.648
It must burn them.

34:15.649 --> 34:17.569
I think it does.

34:26.409 --> 34:28.888
<i>It's buried
deep in all our memories.</i>

34:28.889 --> 34:31.608
<i>In our identity.</i>

34:31.609 --> 34:35.248
<i>Built on the lie of the Timeless Child.</i>

34:42.329 --> 34:45.329
Mm! Right.
Think this'll hold me, do you?

34:56.449 --> 34:57.848
Ugh!

34:57.849 --> 34:59.249
Disgusting.

35:08.769 --> 35:11.128
I have just had the maddest dream.

35:11.129 --> 35:12.688
I know. You all have.

35:12.689 --> 35:14.168
Tranquillising psycho-extraction.

35:14.169 --> 35:15.528
I need to get Tibo.

35:15.529 --> 35:18.368
We have to get everybody safe
and back to their rightful place.

35:18.369 --> 35:21.168
Well, maybe if you stop messing
around with those finger things.

35:21.169 --> 35:24.929
Tapped into the bio-organic code.
Sonic does fingers.

35:29.529 --> 35:31.009
Down.

35:34.609 --> 35:36.328
Stay.

35:36.329 --> 35:37.848
Good dog.

35:37.849 --> 35:39.968
- Ew.
- Could be useful.

35:39.969 --> 35:42.568
Ryan... where am I?

35:42.569 --> 35:44.288
Alright, mate, try
not to freak out, yeah?

35:44.289 --> 35:46.208
But you're on a floating space platform

35:46.209 --> 35:48.728
in a gravitational pull
between two colliding planets

35:48.729 --> 35:50.168
halfway across the universe

35:50.169 --> 35:52.328
'cause of the guy who was
stealing your nightmares

35:52.329 --> 35:53.849
through creepy detachable fingers.

35:54.849 --> 35:56.448
Prank?

35:56.449 --> 35:58.648
No.

35:58.649 --> 36:00.768
Take me through that again.

36:02.569 --> 36:03.928
What are they?

36:03.929 --> 36:06.009
I know why they didn't attack you.

36:07.009 --> 36:08.408
Because they're yours.

36:08.409 --> 36:13.328
Zellin, that man, created the
Chagaska from your nightmares.

36:13.329 --> 36:16.769
They wouldn't kill you. They
couldn't, because you created them.

36:18.849 --> 36:23.528
So, how do you defeat
two rampaging immortals?

36:23.529 --> 36:25.488
Answer... you don't.

36:25.489 --> 36:26.968
Those two planets,

36:26.969 --> 36:29.968
they've spent a millennia
trying to work out how to do it.

36:29.969 --> 36:32.448
Well, I think the motivational
speech needs a bit of work, Doc,

36:32.449 --> 36:34.488
if you don't m... and,
also, a plan, by the way.

36:34.489 --> 36:37.768
I've got plans crashing
through my brain all the time.

36:37.769 --> 36:39.208
You want a plan? Come to me.

36:39.209 --> 36:42.609
Identifying which plan's gonna
work... that's the tricky bit.

36:52.369 --> 36:54.448
This is perfect, Zellin.

36:54.449 --> 36:56.168
You've done well.

36:56.169 --> 36:57.808
Take them all.

36:57.809 --> 36:59.448
Mm.

36:59.449 --> 37:01.689
Billions in one go.

37:03.049 --> 37:05.568
Gorge on their fears.

37:05.569 --> 37:07.089
Why would we rush?

37:08.249 --> 37:09.889
We have so much time...

37:11.569 --> 37:13.969
... to walk in their nightmares.

37:17.049 --> 37:19.089
We can pass eternity here...

37:20.409 --> 37:21.889
... if we take it slow.

37:22.969 --> 37:25.049
Of course.

37:31.969 --> 37:35.288
I've told you... there are no bogeymen.

37:35.289 --> 37:37.488
Nothing to be worried about.

37:37.489 --> 37:39.129
Night-night.

37:59.129 --> 38:02.249
That's not true.

38:22.369 --> 38:24.368
What was that?

38:24.369 --> 38:27.608
I manifested a creature
from a human nightmare.

38:27.609 --> 38:30.008
It's calling across the timewaves.

38:30.009 --> 38:31.809
A pet?

38:35.369 --> 38:37.289
I want to see.

38:46.729 --> 38:48.448
Oh, nice entrance.

38:48.449 --> 38:52.328
Welcome to Aleppo. Very beautiful city.

38:52.329 --> 38:54.488
How are you here?

38:54.489 --> 38:57.528
I'm that little bit smarter
than you thought I was.

38:57.529 --> 39:00.889
Now, listen to me. Earth
is not your plaything.

39:03.129 --> 39:04.848
You're wrong about humans.

39:04.849 --> 39:08.408
They're not pathetic.
They're magnificent.

39:08.409 --> 39:11.928
They live with their
fears, doubts, guilts.

39:11.929 --> 39:15.609
They face them down every
day and they prevail.

39:16.769 --> 39:19.169
That's not weakness. That's strength.

39:20.289 --> 39:22.368
That's what humanity is.

39:22.369 --> 39:24.328
- Isn't that right, Tahira?
- Yes, Doctor.

39:24.329 --> 39:26.968
Why don't you show
them how strong you are?

39:26.969 --> 39:29.489
My Chagaska.

39:31.169 --> 39:33.129
How can you control it?

39:35.089 --> 39:37.928
Literally conquered her fear.

39:37.929 --> 39:40.809
<i>Are you confronting us?</i>

39:42.289 --> 39:43.688
Yeah.

39:43.689 --> 39:45.968
- You immortals.

39:45.969 --> 39:47.768
So entitled. So spoilt.

39:47.769 --> 39:49.288
You never clear up after yourself.

39:49.289 --> 39:51.689
And you should be really careful
what you leave lying around.

39:53.089 --> 39:55.249
Oh! Sorry. I won't do that again.

39:57.169 --> 39:59.249
Just returning your lost property.

40:01.129 --> 40:02.968
Thanks for lending a helping hand.

40:02.969 --> 40:04.529
- Really?
- I couldn't resist.

40:05.809 --> 40:07.449
<i>What's your worst nightmare?</i>

40:10.209 --> 40:11.488
Now, Tahira!

40:18.189 --> 40:20.848
<i>You made my nightmares
real, now you can live with them...</i>

40:20.849 --> 40:22.472
<i>for all eternity.</i>

40:22.473 --> 40:25.041
Yes! Gods back in their box.

40:25.042 --> 40:27.065
We need to get this back
to the monitor platform...

40:27.066 --> 40:28.929
... and all those people
out of the TARDIS jacuzzi.

40:28.930 --> 40:29.930
Come on.

40:41.329 --> 40:43.369
Slept like a baby last night.

40:45.769 --> 40:48.128
Good, 'cause you need all
the beauty sleep you can get.

40:48.129 --> 40:51.328
- Oi. Man's still looking fresh.
- Ooh.

40:54.289 --> 40:55.809
Well, you'll be going again.

40:56.969 --> 40:58.488
Yeah.

40:58.489 --> 41:01.248
But you could've told me
the truth about it all.

41:01.249 --> 41:02.768
Would you have believed me?

41:02.769 --> 41:05.248
Nope.

41:05.249 --> 41:07.489
It's a bit more than just
the world you're seeing.

41:10.409 --> 41:12.969
- Do you know when you'll be back?
- Not sure.

41:15.609 --> 41:17.849
Well, don't make it too long.

41:20.449 --> 41:22.209
I need my best mate.

41:26.489 --> 41:28.369
I get a bit lost without him.

41:30.489 --> 41:32.169
Yeah, I get that too.

41:35.089 --> 41:38.968
Look, I've been looking at
something that might help,

41:38.969 --> 41:40.408
for me mate.

41:40.409 --> 41:43.969
And there's something I need you
to do for me, and you can't argue.

41:45.809 --> 41:50.409
I get down and I shut myself off.

41:52.049 --> 41:53.569
And it's like I'm paralysed with it.

41:54.609 --> 41:56.368
For days.

41:56.369 --> 41:57.889
Weeks.

41:58.969 --> 42:00.569
It's in control of me.

42:02.849 --> 42:04.969
And I thought I'd try
and do something about it.

42:05.969 --> 42:08.368
I went to the supermarket, just
so I could talk to the cashier...

42:08.369 --> 42:10.968
you know, get back to human contact.

42:10.969 --> 42:13.088
But I got there

42:13.089 --> 42:15.648
and it's those self-service checkouts.

42:19.369 --> 42:21.449
I haven't said that to anyone before.

42:23.169 --> 42:25.088
I felt like it was just me.

42:25.089 --> 42:27.009
It's not just you.

42:53.489 --> 42:55.488
Hitchhiking?

42:55.489 --> 42:57.248
No.

42:57.249 --> 42:59.368
Just taking in the view?

42:59.369 --> 43:02.169
- Not breaking the law, am I?
- No.

43:03.169 --> 43:05.009
Where you off to?

43:06.769 --> 43:08.328
Away.

43:08.329 --> 43:09.968
It's good there.

43:09.969 --> 43:12.208
- Leave me alone.
- Can't do that.

43:12.209 --> 43:14.008
Why not?

43:14.009 --> 43:16.368
- People are worried about you.
- No, they're not.

43:16.369 --> 43:18.488
Your sister is.

43:18.489 --> 43:20.129
That's why she called us.

43:21.889 --> 43:24.969
She's worried you've left and
you're gonna do something stupid.

43:27.609 --> 43:29.608
I've heard things are tough.

43:29.609 --> 43:31.608
Getting bullied at school.

43:31.609 --> 43:33.489
Grades have gone a bit wonky.

43:35.089 --> 43:36.849
Parents don't get what's up.

43:40.489 --> 43:42.969
You must be feeling
pretty trapped and alone.

43:44.569 --> 43:46.289
I'm feeling way more than that.

43:49.009 --> 43:50.848
That's better than the other way.

43:50.849 --> 43:52.408
What?

43:52.409 --> 43:55.008
Well, feeling things isn't wrong.

43:55.009 --> 43:57.529
- I don't want your speech.
- I know.

43:59.289 --> 44:01.169
Terrible thing about being older...

44:02.369 --> 44:07.449
... is you have all this experience
and nobody ever wants to hear it.

44:09.449 --> 44:12.849
'Cause I know that there's
so much ahead of you.

44:15.851 --> 44:18.291
What if this moment...

44:19.209 --> 44:22.208
... where you want to run... away
from everyone, including yourself...

44:22.209 --> 44:23.688
is just that?

44:24.376 --> 44:25.414
A moment.

44:27.689 --> 44:30.484
What if we find a way to get you
through it and out the other side?

44:37.195 --> 44:38.675
I've been where you are.

44:41.015 --> 44:42.312
Moments change.

44:44.929 --> 44:48.448
Help's out there, as much
or as little as you need.

44:48.449 --> 44:49.969
I'm not listening to you.

44:52.841 --> 44:54.640
Would hard cash make a difference?

44:56.148 --> 44:57.211
I'll make you a deal.

44:58.209 --> 45:01.568
Look me up in three years. If
I'm wrong, I'll give you 50 quid.

45:01.569 --> 45:03.601
I mean, I'd say more,
but the pay's rubbish.

45:03.849 --> 45:07.369
- Get another job, then.
- Can't. Love it too much.

45:10.092 --> 45:11.652
But if I'm right...

45:12.489 --> 45:14.329
... you owe me 50p.

45:15.849 --> 45:17.448
Come on.

45:17.449 --> 45:19.209
Those are good odds.

45:41.329 --> 45:43.169
Hi. Can I help you?

45:44.369 --> 45:46.375
Hi. You won't remember me.

45:46.376 --> 45:48.008
- My name's Yasm...
- Yasmin Khan.

45:48.009 --> 45:50.129
I flippin' do remember you.

45:55.129 --> 45:57.209
I've got something for you.

46:05.569 --> 46:07.249
You want to come in?

46:10.529 --> 46:15.168
The thing is, Doc, I worry about
getting sick again, you know?

46:15.169 --> 46:18.408
About the... about
the cancer coming back.

46:18.409 --> 46:21.849
And I didn't know who to say it
to, so I thought I'd say it to you.

46:23.009 --> 46:25.009
You know, seeing as you're a doctor.

46:26.009 --> 46:27.368
Look, 'cause once...

46:27.369 --> 46:30.408
... once you have it, it's
with you the whole time.

46:30.409 --> 46:32.328
Not... not quite a shadow, but, uh...

46:32.329 --> 46:35.728
Hey, don't get me wrong... I mean,
my check-ups, they're all fine.

46:35.729 --> 46:37.409
But it... it made me think.

46:38.609 --> 46:40.328
You know? And, uh...

46:40.329 --> 46:42.609
... I thought I should talk about it.

46:43.729 --> 46:45.609
'Cause those nightmares... I mean...

46:46.689 --> 46:48.528
Well,
they made me realise

46:48.529 --> 46:52.249
that the fear is...
is still there. Yeah.

46:58.929 --> 47:01.169
I should say a reassuring
thing now, shouldn't I?

47:02.729 --> 47:04.568
Yeah, probably.

47:04.569 --> 47:06.689
I'm still quite socially awkward.

47:08.449 --> 47:11.408
So, I'm just gonna subtly
walk towards the console

47:11.409 --> 47:13.088
and look at something.

47:13.089 --> 47:15.449
And then... in a minute...

47:16.809 --> 47:19.089
... I'll think of something
that I should've said...

47:21.129 --> 47:22.568
... that might have been helpful.

47:22.569 --> 47:24.608
Okay.

47:24.609 --> 47:27.008
Well...

47:27.009 --> 47:28.928
I'm glad we had this chat, eh?

47:28.929 --> 47:30.369
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

47:31.649 --> 47:33.729
How long is this gonna last, Yaz?

47:34.769 --> 47:36.888
Hanging out with the Doctor.

47:36.889 --> 47:39.368
I don't know.

47:39.369 --> 47:41.048
Is this our lives?

47:41.049 --> 47:44.329
Going from one place to
the next, ignoring home?

47:45.649 --> 47:47.529
We're getting older but without them.

47:49.649 --> 47:51.088
Missing out bits of their lives.

47:51.089 --> 47:52.568
When we're done,

47:52.569 --> 47:54.928
the Doctor can drop you off at
whatever point you want, though.

47:54.929 --> 47:57.128
Yeah, but we'll have
changed. They wouldn't have.

47:57.129 --> 47:59.928
It's like we're living
at different rates.

47:59.929 --> 48:01.889
The Doctor said we
won't come back the same.

48:04.889 --> 48:07.088
I was thinking... Frankenstein.

48:07.089 --> 48:08.368
What?
- Did I interrupt?

48:08.369 --> 48:09.448
Am I interrupting?

48:09.449 --> 48:11.448
- No.
- Cool.

48:11.449 --> 48:13.449
You might need to change your clothes.

48:15.009 --> 48:16.255
On we go.

48:16.817 --> 48:17.966
On we go.

48:18.249 --> 48:19.569
Right.

49:02.129 --> 49:04.648
How about writing the most gruesome,

49:04.649 --> 49:07.888
spine-chilling ghost story of all time?

49:09.890 --> 49:12.169
Tales of the Dead.

49:13.305 --> 49:19.526
