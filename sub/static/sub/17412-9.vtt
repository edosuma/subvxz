00:06.140 --> 00:08.307
    - Well, I'm really glad
          we did this.

00:08.309 --> 00:10.242
      - Yeah, I--that was
           wonderful.

00:10.244 --> 00:12.711
     I love <i> mother courage.</i>
   I think it's a great play.

00:12.713 --> 00:14.113
         - Yes, me too.

00:18.218 --> 00:21.387
      Mm, um, marcus is at
a friend's house tonight, yeah?

00:21.389 --> 00:24.256
      Did you, um, want me
       to come in, or...

00:24.258 --> 00:26.225
             - Oh.
          - I could...

00:26.227 --> 00:31.330
  Have a glass of wine, or...
            - Boop!

00:31.332 --> 00:33.565
   Maybe--maybe another time.
             Ahem.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.734
             Yeah.
  - Sure, have a great night.

00:35.736 --> 00:39.238
           - You too.

00:39.240 --> 00:42.307
         - Oh, my god.
    - Are you spying on me?

00:42.309 --> 00:43.409
         - It was like
        a car accident,

00:43.411 --> 00:44.710
       And I didn't want
            to look,

00:44.712 --> 00:46.278
         But I couldn't
       tear my eyes away.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.348
      Did you just "boop"
     mr. Chris on the nose?

00:49.350 --> 00:51.483
  - Oh, he wanted to come in,
            and I...

00:51.485 --> 00:53.118
           Panicked.
             - Why?

00:53.120 --> 00:54.820
      - 'cause, you know,

00:54.822 --> 00:56.655
          We haven't--
            - what?

00:56.657 --> 00:57.756
      You haven't shoveled
         snow together?

00:57.758 --> 01:00.225
        - We haven't...

01:00.227 --> 01:02.694
          Consummated.
            - What?

01:02.696 --> 01:04.663
              Ew.
         What are you--

01:04.665 --> 01:06.231
         - Oh, stop it.
            Stop it.

01:06.233 --> 01:08.167
    - You guys have gone on,
     like, what, six dates

01:08.169 --> 01:09.768
      And you guys haven't
        slept together?

01:09.770 --> 01:11.637
            - Eight.
      And I know the time

01:11.639 --> 01:15.474
        Probably is now.
 - The time was six dates ago.

01:15.476 --> 01:19.111
   - I'm out of practice and
 I can't get over this hurdle.

01:19.113 --> 01:22.548
     How do people just go
      from not having sex

01:22.550 --> 01:27.252
         To having sex?
  What happens in the middle?

01:27.254 --> 01:29.288
             - Sex.
   Sex happens in the middle.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.623
     And in the beginning,
        and in the end.

01:31.625 --> 01:34.093
     Look, mr. Chris isn't
       my favorite person

01:34.095 --> 01:36.195
      In the whole world,
     but he's still a guy.

01:36.197 --> 01:38.464
      He's still a human.
   You need to get over this,

01:38.466 --> 01:39.832
   You know, hurdle of yours

01:39.834 --> 01:41.667
       Or he's not going
    to stick around, fiona.

01:41.669 --> 01:46.271
    And when you do "do it,"
        do not tell me.

01:51.244 --> 01:53.112
         - Here we go.

02:29.182 --> 02:31.250
             What?

02:33.820 --> 02:36.922
- And these are some of the ribs
that we've eaten over the years.

02:36.924 --> 02:39.591
   We got the feelings wheel,
     some orange soda legs,

02:39.593 --> 02:41.193
     And we have the knife

   You know, honestly I think
       this is the moment

02:43.264 --> 02:45.497
      When our friendship
    just became undeniable.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.199
         - Definitely.
        What's the hair?

02:47.201 --> 02:49.334
   - Oh, the hair is actually
           your hair.

02:49.336 --> 02:50.736
     You see, I snuck into
         your bathroom

02:50.738 --> 02:52.404
       And took some from
       your shower drain.

02:52.406 --> 02:54.606
      There's even some of
    my mom's in there, too.

  to show you until tomorrow.

02:59.213 --> 03:03.248
    - Which would make today
       manniversary eve.

03:03.250 --> 03:05.450
            - Right.
       Right, of course.

03:05.452 --> 03:08.253
         And that would
        make tomorrow...

03:08.255 --> 03:10.189
         Manniversary.

03:10.191 --> 03:12.691
 - Can you believe it's a year
ago tomorrow that we first met?

03:12.693 --> 03:14.459
          - Obviously.

03:14.461 --> 03:16.762
     Aw, man, this is such
            a nice--

03:16.764 --> 03:19.398

03:22.203 --> 03:26.205
     Lot of brainstorming,
         image boards,

03:26.207 --> 03:27.739
        Bone scrubbing.
      - Man, I can't wait

03:27.741 --> 03:30.309
    To see what you got me.
      - Yeah, me neither.

03:30.311 --> 03:31.543
     - Could I have a hint?
No, no, no, I don't want a hint.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.412
             - Oh.
  - Okay, maybe just one hint.

03:33.414 --> 03:34.947
    - Well, let me tell you
       something, marcus.

03:34.949 --> 03:36.715
        I can't tell you
         what I got you

  'cause obviously tomorrow's
        the actual day,

    But what I can tell you
           as a hint,

03:40.487 --> 03:45.624
         Is that it is
    exactly what you wanted.

03:45.626 --> 03:46.858
        - No, it's not.
          - [chuckles]

03:46.860 --> 03:48.594
         - Yeah, it is.
      - You got me tickets

03:48.596 --> 03:50.395
  To the golden gate femfest?

03:50.397 --> 03:52.598
 Mom, this is the greatest day
          of my life.

03:52.600 --> 03:56.602
           - I know.
    The golden gate femfest.

03:56.604 --> 04:00.606
       The folk festival
   of iconic female singers.

04:00.608 --> 04:02.608
   Marcus has been begging me
          to take him

04:02.610 --> 04:05.010
   Ever since we moved here.
       - And that is why

04:05.012 --> 04:07.646
       I have gotten you
        a ticket, buddy.

04:07.648 --> 04:09.248
        Yep, you're go--
          we're going.

04:09.250 --> 04:11.016
    Two tickets to femfest.
          You and me.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.651

       all the way, bud.

            - Whoa.
       Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:16.023 --> 04:17.522
         Does that mean
     what I think it means?

04:17.524 --> 04:18.957
     I'm meeting lisa loeb?
             - Ah--

04:18.959 --> 04:21.793
       - Grammy-nominated
       singer/songwriter/

04:21.795 --> 04:23.829
     Eyeglasses trendsetter
           lisa loeb?

04:23.831 --> 04:25.764
       - I guess you are.
         - Oh, my god!

04:25.766 --> 04:27.599
    I have to find something
            to wear.

04:27.601 --> 04:28.967
      Something that says,
    "I'm obsessed with you,

04:28.969 --> 04:30.669
       But I'm still just
         a normal boy."

04:30.671 --> 04:33.338
 Um, maybe my lisa loeb shirt,
    and my lisa loeb beanie,

04:33.340 --> 04:34.873
         But, you know,
       just normal pants.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.708
     Yeah, I don't want to
   come across as a stalker.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.377
           All right,
       I love you, will!

04:38.379 --> 04:40.912
      - All right, buddy.
         See you later.

04:40.914 --> 04:42.381
         What the hell
         just happened?

04:42.383 --> 04:44.349
       - You may not have
       those tickets yet,

04:44.351 --> 04:45.784
        But you're going
          to get them.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.486
 Every man in that child's life
         lets him down,

04:47.488 --> 04:48.920
          You will not
     be another one, will.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.789
      - I don't even know
       who lisa loeb is.

04:50.791 --> 04:54.660
          - ¶ you say
  I only hear what I want to ¶

04:54.662 --> 04:57.362
    ¶ talk so all the time ¶
     - please stop, please!

04:57.364 --> 05:00.332
    I mean, who in the world
      has ever even heard

05:00.334 --> 05:03.635
    Of golden gate femfest?

05:03.637 --> 05:05.470
         - Um, we have.
       We go every year.

05:05.472 --> 05:07.039
            - What?
            - Yeah.

05:07.041 --> 05:08.874
      That's not something
I scream from the mountaintops,

05:08.876 --> 05:12.377
        But laurie loves
        a folk festival.

05:12.379 --> 05:14.513
     She becomes the laurie
      I fell in love with.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.982
     She gets funny, wild,

05:16.984 --> 05:19.685
             Sexy.
        - Oh, god, dude.

05:19.687 --> 05:21.386
        - No underwear.

05:21.388 --> 05:22.688
        But I don't know
    what you're going to do.

05:22.690 --> 05:23.922
    It's been sold out for,
         like, a month.

05:23.924 --> 05:25.590
            - What?
  - Yeah, we got our tickets,

05:25.592 --> 05:27.059
     Like, four months ago.
   - Well, you gotta give me

05:27.061 --> 05:28.927
       Your tickets then,
      because I can't let

05:28.929 --> 05:30.362
         The kid down,
         you know that.

05:30.364 --> 05:33.498
          - You know,
     you take a lot, will.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.567
       You will not take
        femfest laurie.

05:35.569 --> 05:37.402
         You will not.

05:40.073 --> 05:43.642
          - Oh, hello.
Hello, marcus' english teacher.

05:43.644 --> 05:46.812
     Um, mr. Chris, is it?
         - Yes, hello.

05:46.814 --> 05:48.013
            - Hello.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.648
      I wonder if we could
          have a word?

05:49.650 --> 05:51.650
           - We--yes,
      I actually wanted--

05:51.652 --> 05:53.385
       I actually wanted
    to talk to you as well,

05:53.387 --> 05:57.422
         About marcus'
   <i> death of a salesman</i> paper.

05:57.424 --> 05:58.757
            - Good.
           Both: Yes.

05:58.759 --> 06:00.692
      Let's go over here.

06:00.694 --> 06:04.129
          I was just--
I was just thinking, um, ahem--

06:04.131 --> 06:07.999
   Instead of, uh, going out
   for dinner tomorrow night,

06:08.001 --> 06:09.768
       I thought perhaps
       we could stay in.

06:09.770 --> 06:13.038
     Marcus is going to be
       gone all evening.

06:13.040 --> 06:17.609
  So I thought that you could
     finally see my house.

06:17.611 --> 06:23.482
             - Oh.
   - You know, all the rooms.

06:23.484 --> 06:24.816
      - That sounds great.
       What can I bring?

06:24.818 --> 06:26.451
        A bottle of red?
            Dessert?

06:26.453 --> 06:27.986
             - No.
        No, no, no, no.

06:27.988 --> 06:31.790
          I-I will be
       providing dessert

06:31.792 --> 06:34.092
         With my body.

06:34.094 --> 06:36.395
    - Your body is dessert,
           I got it.

06:36.397 --> 06:37.562
       Well, I'm excited.

06:37.564 --> 06:38.797
         - Okay, yeah.
           I am, too.

06:38.799 --> 06:40.732
         I must go now.

06:40.734 --> 06:43.602
        This is the face
     of an excited person.

06:50.176 --> 06:50.609
               .

06:50.611 --> 06:54.846
        For eight dates
   if you're not having sex.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.415
         - Well, pfft.

06:56.417 --> 06:58.750
       He's a fascinating
       conversationalist.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.419
     I mean, he's traveled
      all over the world.

07:00.421 --> 07:02.587
           - Exactly.
 Can you imagine what he knows,

07:02.589 --> 07:03.688
       What he's learned?
            - Yeah.

07:03.690 --> 07:05.424
  He's learned six languages.

07:05.426 --> 07:09.127
  And he's currently learning
      conversational zulu.

07:09.129 --> 07:10.829
  - No, I'm talking positions.
          - Positions?

07:10.831 --> 07:13.765
    Well, hold on, hold on.
   I mean, let's just review.

07:13.767 --> 07:16.568
       I mean, there's--
 there's basically two posit--

07:16.570 --> 07:18.170
      Well, there's three.

07:18.172 --> 07:19.538
       Lying down's one.
   - Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

07:19.540 --> 07:22.908
            - Flip--
   - fiona, you have to learn

07:22.910 --> 07:25.444
        To turn the mom
           part off,

07:25.446 --> 07:27.078
      And the sex goddess
            part on.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.647
        - Yeah, but how
         do I do that?

07:28.649 --> 07:30.582
            - Well,

07:30.584 --> 07:32.884
         I take a shot
        of goldschlager

07:32.886 --> 07:35.487
    And watch an episode of
    <i> orange is the new black.</i>

07:35.489 --> 07:36.855
     But that's what works
            for me.

07:36.857 --> 07:38.957
        You have to find
      what works for you.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.525
      How's your bedroom?
       Is it appropriate

07:40.527 --> 07:41.793
     To entertain a man in?

07:41.795 --> 07:44.463
    - Um, yeah, yeah, yeah,
    yeah, yeah, absolutely.

07:44.465 --> 07:45.931
           I think--
        I think that's--

07:45.933 --> 07:46.965
     - I don't believe you.
      - I think that it--

07:46.967 --> 07:48.767
        - That'll be our
          second stop.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.702
             - Why?
             What--

07:50.704 --> 07:52.771
          Oh, god, no.
   I've shaved up to my knee.

07:52.773 --> 07:57.876
          - Oh, honey,
we're going way above the knee.

07:57.878 --> 08:00.479
     It's going to be like
        a little pinch.

08:00.481 --> 08:01.880
         Just give her
       what you give me.

08:01.882 --> 08:04.649
       - Right this way.

08:04.651 --> 08:09.955
           Brazilian?
         - No, british.

08:09.957 --> 08:11.590
         - Do you think
       anybody else here

08:11.592 --> 08:12.791
         Is celebrating
      their manniversary?

08:12.793 --> 08:14.926
      - I highly doubt it.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.628
        - Oh hey, look.
             - Hey.

08:16.630 --> 08:17.896
       - What's up, guys?
             - Hey.

08:17.898 --> 08:18.964
          - What's up?
            - Whoo.

08:18.966 --> 08:20.932
             - Oh.
          Wow, laurie.

08:20.934 --> 08:23.902
      You look different.
  - Thank you very much, will.

08:23.904 --> 08:25.904
      - I said different.
      Keep your pants on.

08:25.906 --> 08:27.506
    - How'd you get the tix?

08:27.508 --> 08:29.908
       - My buddy, craig.
        - Mr. List, huh?

08:29.910 --> 08:31.243
     - How have I never met
           this guy?

08:31.245 --> 08:32.644
   - Marcus, are you excited?

08:32.645 --> 08:34.546
   - I'm so excited, laurie.

08:34.548 --> 08:35.947
       Hey, do you think
    I could have a brownie?

08:35.948 --> 08:37.215
       - Oh, no, no, no.
        - Oh, no, dude.

08:37.217 --> 08:38.650
  - Those are andy's brownies.

08:38.652 --> 08:39.885
       - Adult brownies.

08:39.886 --> 08:40.885
       - They have coffee
            in them.

08:40.888 --> 08:41.886
        Lots of coffee.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.822
  God, I hate being pregnant.

08:43.823 --> 08:45.557
         I miss coffee.
         - That's okay.

08:45.559 --> 08:46.825
         I'll just have
     a rice krispie treat.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.660
           Both: No.
   - Those have coffee, too.

08:48.662 --> 08:50.929
        - Chicken kabob?

08:50.931 --> 08:52.864
       - Seriously, guys?
     In the chicken kabobs?

08:52.866 --> 08:54.699
             - Yep.
 - You know what, that's fine.

08:54.701 --> 08:56.301
  You know, if I eat something
        I might throw up

08:56.303 --> 08:59.771
     When I meet lisa loeb.
 - You're gonna meet lisa loeb?

08:59.773 --> 09:01.673
            - Yeah.
 Will arranged the whole thing.

09:01.675 --> 09:03.775
     - Really? Didn't know
   mr. List had that hook-up.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.777
          - Wow, will.

09:05.779 --> 09:07.579
  I'm having feelings for you
    I've never felt before.

09:07.581 --> 09:09.848
    - Oh, well, it was only
   a matter of time, laurie.

09:09.850 --> 09:12.684
       Thank you, really.
   I'm flattered, but, never.

09:12.686 --> 09:15.954
Even if andy was hit by a truck
   and his last dying wish--

09:15.956 --> 09:18.790
        - Respect, will.
         And it's gone.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.292
      - Why has it always
  got to be a truck with you?

09:20.294 --> 09:22.694
        It's so violent.
   - It's better than a car.

09:22.696 --> 09:24.563
   - How'd you hook that up?
      She's the headliner.

09:24.565 --> 09:26.264
       That's a big deal.
 - Because I'm very important,

09:26.266 --> 09:27.866
          That's how.
    Let's go meet lisa loeb.

09:27.868 --> 09:30.302
        - Yeah, you are.
           [chuckles]

09:30.304 --> 09:32.070
  - I think you should lay off
          the coffee.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.740
           - [gasps]

09:35.742 --> 09:38.276
          Oh. My. God.

09:38.278 --> 09:39.778
            No, no.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.813
       You can't have sex
         in this room.

09:41.815 --> 09:42.814
             - Why?
            Why not?

09:42.816 --> 09:44.683
     - Okay, picture this:

09:44.685 --> 09:46.985
       You're in the bed
  about to get down and dirty.

09:46.987 --> 09:48.920
        Chris leans over
     to turn off the light

09:48.922 --> 09:50.655
     And what does he see?

09:50.657 --> 09:52.924
   <i> Constipation, withholding,</i>
        <i> and your child.</i>

09:52.926 --> 09:54.693
   - Yeah, a family guide to
      soiling and wetting.

09:54.695 --> 09:55.860
             - No.
           - It's a--

09:55.862 --> 09:59.798
        - No, it's not.
    And with all the photos

09:59.800 --> 10:02.834
           Of marcus.
    - Yeah, but he's my son.

10:02.836 --> 10:03.802
    Of course I got pictures
     of him in my bedroom.

10:03.804 --> 10:05.604
            - Fiona.

10:05.606 --> 10:06.838
        - Okay, I'll put
         tedicus away.

10:06.840 --> 10:07.839
            - Okay.
            Oh, hey.

10:07.841 --> 10:09.674
       I got you a gift.

10:09.676 --> 10:11.943
         - Oh, you did?
  - This is what I would wear

10:11.945 --> 10:13.979
  If I was spending the night
        with mr. Chris.

10:13.981 --> 10:18.817
Not that I've thought about it.

10:18.819 --> 10:20.251
       - Is it a hairnet?

10:20.253 --> 10:21.820
             - No.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.722
         It's lingerie!

10:23.724 --> 10:26.691
    Oh, my god, what are you
     wearing on your feet?

10:26.693 --> 10:29.694
       - Um, what--those?
 - No, nobody wants to have sex

10:29.696 --> 10:30.996
           In clogs.
            - I do.

10:30.998 --> 10:33.365
            - Here.
             Here.

10:33.367 --> 10:35.767
             Here.
      My mom always said,

10:35.769 --> 10:40.739
   "if you want to feel sexy,
  wear a pair of sexy boots."

10:40.741 --> 10:42.941
         Why did my mom
       buy me sex boots?

10:42.943 --> 10:44.843
    Maybe I need to go back
          to therapy.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.811
    - Yeah, but don't sleep
   with your therapist again.

10:46.813 --> 10:49.848
      - Well, I am a woman
       with needs, fiona.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.082
    - Oh, my god, he's here.

10:51.084 --> 10:53.251
         - Okay, okay.
        Okay, calm down.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.687
            Breathe.
      You're going to go.

10:55.689 --> 10:56.955
     You're going to put on
           the boots.

10:56.957 --> 10:58.023
    I'll clean up your room.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.958
  And I'll go out the window.
            - What?

10:59.960 --> 11:01.926
     - I've done it before.
           Okay, go.

11:01.928 --> 11:04.129
             Boots.

11:04.131 --> 11:05.664
  That's a lot of teddy bears.

11:05.666 --> 11:06.998
       - I think my feet
 are a bit beefier than yours.

11:09.835 --> 11:12.337
             Hello.
             - Hi.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.339
             Here.
        - Oh, thank you.

11:14.341 --> 11:17.909
     - You look beautiful.
          - Thank you.

11:17.911 --> 11:21.446
             - Wow.

11:30.122 --> 11:30.355
               .

11:30.357 --> 11:33.758
       I mean, if this is
        what we're doing

11:33.760 --> 11:35.193
  For out first manniversary,

11:35.195 --> 11:37.228
     Imagine what we'll do
      for, like, our 20th.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.330
    I mean, ten is tin, so,
           you know,

11:39.332 --> 11:41.366
      That one's obvious.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.034
       - Passes, please.
       - Oh, no, no, no.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.402
      We're with the band.
     - Which band is that?

11:44.404 --> 11:46.871
          - Lisa loeb.
          - Oh, okay.

11:46.873 --> 11:49.007
        Passes, please.
   - Marcus, can you give us

11:49.009 --> 11:50.442
          A quick sec?
          Go check out

11:50.444 --> 11:54.345
       That joni mitchell
  cactus garden I saw before.

11:54.347 --> 11:57.949
         Look, edison.
 That's a cool name by the way.

11:57.951 --> 11:59.818
       You got any kids?
            - Seven.

11:59.820 --> 12:02.020
         - Oh, my god.
             Seven?

12:02.022 --> 12:03.488
        Whoa, well done.

12:03.490 --> 12:05.323
           Same mom?
          That's not--

12:05.325 --> 12:07.826
    That's not my business.
 I don't know why I asked that.

12:07.828 --> 12:08.927
     But you get it, right?

12:08.929 --> 12:10.929
        When you promise
        a kid something,

12:10.931 --> 12:12.063
     You don't want to let
           them down.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.265
       - That's your kid?

12:14.267 --> 12:15.867
      - He's my neighbor.
       - Okay, first off,

12:15.869 --> 12:18.503
       You're a grown man
           at femfest

12:18.505 --> 12:20.405
      With your little boy
           neighbor.

12:20.407 --> 12:23.007
     That's a little weird.
    - Well, I care about him

12:23.009 --> 12:24.843
       And he care about
      women's folk music.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.845
         Is that weird?
         - Yeah, kinda.

12:26.847 --> 12:28.880
   Second off, I would never
         promise my kid

12:28.882 --> 12:30.915
      Something I couldn't
          deliver on.

12:30.917 --> 12:33.351
   Because I have integrity.
          - 200 bucks?

12:33.353 --> 12:35.220
      - I have seven kids.
            - Okay.

12:35.222 --> 12:37.489
 Cost of integrity has gone up.
           - Way up.

12:37.491 --> 12:41.326
          - All right.
       Marcus, we're in.

12:41.328 --> 12:43.328
     Don't be afraid to use
   some of that for condoms.

12:44.930 --> 12:48.199
      - This looks great.
        - Oh, yeah, I-I-

12:48.201 --> 12:52.003
     I think fondue is such
   a sensual food, isn't it?

12:52.005 --> 12:54.172
            - Yeah.

12:54.174 --> 12:56.374
- I probably shouldn't have made
 it with cashew cheese 'cause--

12:56.376 --> 12:59.944
             - Oh.
   - I'm--gosh, it's really--

12:59.946 --> 13:02.447
        - You know what?
          I'll just...

13:02.449 --> 13:04.516
    Scrape it out of there.
      It's gonna be fine.

13:04.518 --> 13:08.086
   - Didn't think it through,
            really.

13:08.088 --> 13:09.487
        - Are you okay?

13:09.489 --> 13:12.991
       - I'm fine, yeah.

13:12.993 --> 13:14.526
            - Good.
            - Okay.

13:14.528 --> 13:15.894
            - Okay.
     - Oh, bloody hell, no.

13:15.896 --> 13:18.229
            Oh, ah.
     Don't touch me there.

13:18.231 --> 13:20.465
      I did a yoga class.
           Very sore.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.801
  Oh, look, we need more wine.

13:24.570 --> 13:28.072
- Marcus did write an excellent
 paper on <i> death of a salesman.</i>

13:28.074 --> 13:29.307
         - Oh, did he?
    Oh, let's not talk about

13:29.309 --> 13:30.575
          Marcus now.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.343
        He's not really
    that interesting, is he?

13:32.345 --> 13:33.878
      Oh, you know, kids.
           [snoring]

13:33.880 --> 13:36.047
         Boring, right?
             Wine?

13:36.049 --> 13:37.515
          There we go.
    - Just a little, thanks.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.050
            - Okay.
          - Thank you.

13:39.052 --> 13:41.186
           - Cheers.

13:47.359 --> 13:48.326
             Right.
    I'm done with the wine.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.594
    Should we have dessert?

13:49.596 --> 13:52.130
       Upstairs dessert?
        - Fiona, fiona.

13:52.132 --> 13:54.232
      Why don't we just--
       - no, bup-bup-bup.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.901
          Gotta get up
        to the boudoir.

13:56.903 --> 13:58.603
        And if you could
         meet me there,

13:58.605 --> 14:01.606
     Just give me a minute
  'cause I want to get ready.

14:01.608 --> 14:06.411
           Uh, count
        100 mississippi.

14:06.413 --> 14:09.981
       Or just count like
           an adult.

14:12.117 --> 14:16.054
              Oh!

14:16.056 --> 14:17.856
             - Oh.
     How much longer are we

14:17.858 --> 14:19.924
         Going to wait
         for lisa loeb?

14:19.926 --> 14:21.359
        - You know what?
    We're not going to wait

14:21.361 --> 14:23.027
         For lisa loeb.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.262
    We're going to go after
           lisa loeb.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.864
            Come on.

14:25.866 --> 14:28.233
        She's gonna have
  the biggest trailer, right?

14:28.235 --> 14:30.535
      - I bet it's purple.
       She loves purple.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.437
        It could also be
 a hello kitty trailer though.

14:32.439 --> 14:34.038
  She also loves hello kitty.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.907
   We could try to sniff out
          the coffee.

14:35.909 --> 14:38.877
 Because did you know lisa loeb
   has her own coffee brand?

14:38.879 --> 14:41.346
     And her own eyeglasses
          collection?

14:41.348 --> 14:45.583
 Man, I wish I was cool enough
        to wear glasses.

14:45.585 --> 14:48.152
            - Bingo.
            Come on.

14:48.154 --> 14:50.521
      - Oh, I think I just
          peed myself.

14:50.523 --> 14:52.357
     No, wait, that's just
          the juicebox

14:52.359 --> 14:56.194
        She loves juice.
     Is she even in there?

14:56.196 --> 14:57.428
   - I'm gonna need your help
           with this.

14:57.430 --> 14:58.596
          - Oh, okay.

14:58.598 --> 15:01.232
   Are you sure we're allowed
          to do this?

15:01.234 --> 15:04.068
          Okay, I see
     a hunched over figure.

15:04.070 --> 15:06.437
     So beautiful, spunky,
           and wise.

15:06.439 --> 15:08.273
             Yeah,
     that's definitely her.

15:08.275 --> 15:10.909
  Oh, wait, she's getting up.
      She's looking at me.

15:10.911 --> 15:12.343
   - Is she happy or pissed?
           - Unclear.

15:12.345 --> 15:15.480
  But I am making eye contact
        with lisa loeb.

15:15.482 --> 15:17.248
          - Excuse me.

15:17.250 --> 15:20.051
     You're coming with me.
      - What's that, now?

15:20.053 --> 15:23.254
          - Oh my god.
           What is--

15:23.256 --> 15:25.089
      Bloody hell, dakota.
          That's not--

15:25.091 --> 15:26.591
       - 96 mississippi.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.326
        - Okay, hold on.
            Hold on.

15:28.328 --> 15:29.661
            Hold on.

15:29.663 --> 15:32.030
              Oh!
       - 98 mississippi.

15:32.032 --> 15:33.231
     - Is it supposed to be
           that red?

15:33.233 --> 15:35.233
             Is it?
       - 99 mississippi.

15:35.235 --> 15:37.135
        - God, he's such
     a bloody fast counter.

15:37.137 --> 15:38.336
       - 100 mississippi.

15:38.338 --> 15:43.341
          - All right.
            Coming!

15:43.343 --> 15:46.577
             Ahem.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.613
           - Wow, hi.
            - Hello.

15:48.615 --> 15:51.149
   - So this is your bedroom.
             - Yep.

15:51.151 --> 15:54.385
             Yeah.
This is where the magic happens.

15:54.387 --> 15:58.389
   I mean, not all the time.
       Just occasionally.

15:58.391 --> 16:01.559
        Not that often.
 Um, should we sit on the bed?

16:01.561 --> 16:05.463
         - Yes, let's.
            - Okay.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.732
    - Are you limping, or--
           - no, no.

16:07.734 --> 16:10.969
       Have a seat under
       the mosquito net.

16:10.971 --> 16:15.039
            - Sure.
             Just--

16:15.041 --> 16:19.143
             - Oh.
           [chuckles]

16:19.145 --> 16:21.713
             Great.
           [chuckles]

16:25.684 --> 16:27.518
           Oh, dear.

16:27.520 --> 16:30.388
         The, uh, yeah.
              Um--

16:30.390 --> 16:32.390
    Boot actually does hurt
          quite a lot.

16:32.392 --> 16:33.758
     - Well, do you want to
         take them off?

16:33.760 --> 16:36.527
             - No.
      No, absolutely not.

16:39.698 --> 16:41.366
     - Are you shuddering?
        - Yes, actually.

16:41.368 --> 16:43.067
       Horribly painful.

16:43.069 --> 16:44.435
 Then wh--here, let me help you
      take this boot off.

16:44.437 --> 16:48.606
            - Okay.
             Okay.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.441
       You sure? I just--
         - oh, no, no.

16:50.443 --> 16:52.377
- I think you should just relax.
   - I've got good momentum.

16:52.379 --> 16:53.544
            [grunts]
             - ahh!

16:53.546 --> 16:54.545
             - Oh!

16:54.547 --> 16:56.781
          Bloody hell.

16:56.783 --> 16:59.217
       - Oh, my--oh, god!
    - Oh, is it--is it bad?

16:59.219 --> 17:00.284
            - Yeah.

17:03.722 --> 17:04.155
               .

17:04.156 --> 17:07.325
       - So you never had
     the vip tickets, huh?

17:07.327 --> 17:09.460
      - No, bud, I didn't.

17:09.462 --> 17:11.095
        - Why didn't you
         just tell me?

17:11.097 --> 17:14.332
      - Because, you know,
   well, I just--I messed up.

17:14.334 --> 17:16.701
      I wanted to give you
  the best manniversary ever,

17:16.703 --> 17:18.202
       But the problem is
         I didn't know

17:18.204 --> 17:19.804
       That manniversary
      was an actual thing

17:19.806 --> 17:21.372
     Until the day before.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.641
    - There's no such thing
       as a manniversary?

17:23.643 --> 17:25.643
             - Eh.

17:25.645 --> 17:28.646
  - Then I was a real jerk to
 the guy at the hallmark store.

17:28.648 --> 17:31.049
          - [chuckles]

17:31.051 --> 17:33.551
       Look, I--you know,
I thought I had the connections.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.053
   I thought I could get you
       to meet your idol,

17:35.055 --> 17:36.788
        But I couldn't,
            and, uh,

17:36.790 --> 17:39.824
           I'm sorry.

17:39.826 --> 17:42.160
       - You know, will,
      my mom always said,

17:42.162 --> 17:44.462
 "never meet your idol because
  they always disappoint you."

17:44.464 --> 17:47.165
 You see, that's why it's great
        I met you first

17:47.167 --> 17:48.733
     As the weird neighbor.

17:48.735 --> 17:52.170
    Then I realized you were
    the coolest person ever.

17:52.172 --> 17:54.806
       - In what universe
    am I the weird neighbor?

17:54.808 --> 17:58.142
 - This has been the best year
       of my life, will.

17:58.144 --> 18:01.646
     You know, you may not
      know this about me,

18:01.648 --> 18:05.216
    But I didn't really have
     a lot of close friends

18:05.218 --> 18:07.185
       Before I met you.

18:07.187 --> 18:09.353
        - Well, I knew.
   - I was just moving around

18:09.355 --> 18:11.122
            So much.
      It was pretty hard.

18:11.124 --> 18:13.157
        I always wanted
         a best friend.

18:13.159 --> 18:15.593
     And I never would have
          even dreamed

18:15.595 --> 18:18.463
      Of having an awesome
     friendship like ours.

18:18.465 --> 18:21.599
      - Me neither, buddy.
          Me neither.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.668
      - I don't even need
       to meet lisa loeb.

18:23.670 --> 18:25.369
    Maybe we could just find
        andy and laurie

18:25.371 --> 18:27.138
         And have some
        adult brownies.

18:27.140 --> 18:30.141
 - Well, I think we're going to
       skip the brownies,

18:30.143 --> 18:32.243
      But I'm gonna get us
          out of here.

18:32.245 --> 18:33.845
            Edison.

18:37.449 --> 18:39.817
    - I probably should have
        said before, um,

18:39.819 --> 18:43.187
     But it's been a while
  since I've been with a man.

18:43.189 --> 18:47.558
         Um, I know sex
   isn't a big deal, I mean,

18:47.560 --> 18:49.360
       Everybody does it,
          don't they?

18:49.362 --> 18:52.563
       And it--it's just
        a casual thing.

18:52.565 --> 18:57.902
      But it's not casual
            for me.

18:57.904 --> 19:00.905
   And I know that's exactly
  what every man wants to hear

19:00.907 --> 19:05.343
     Right before he jumps
    in the sack with a girl.

19:05.345 --> 19:07.478
            - Fiona,
    you're a single mother,

19:07.480 --> 19:09.180
    The parent of one of my
           students,

19:09.182 --> 19:11.182
     And you haven't dated
          in a decade.

19:11.184 --> 19:13.184
      You really think if
   I wanted something casual,

19:13.186 --> 19:15.253
         I'd pick you?

19:17.489 --> 19:20.258
             Boop.
           [laughing]

19:20.260 --> 19:25.663
      I find you radiant,
  and funny, and fascinating.

19:25.665 --> 19:29.200
          I have loved
      getting to know you.

19:29.202 --> 19:31.736
        And I can wait.

19:31.738 --> 19:37.208
           - I can't.

19:37.210 --> 19:38.843
             - Oh!
    - Oh, are you all right?

19:38.845 --> 19:41.179
        - I'm gonna need
       another ice pack.

19:41.181 --> 19:44.182
        But I can wait.

19:44.184 --> 19:45.850
    - Go buy yourself a car.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.518
           - Oh, man.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.521
      Our seats are really
           far away.

19:50.523 --> 19:51.889
    - We got to walk through
        a lot of hippies

19:51.891 --> 19:53.357
    And a lot of patchouli.

19:53.359 --> 19:54.859
   Maybe we should just find
           some seats

19:54.861 --> 19:56.227
      A little bit closer.

19:56.229 --> 19:57.461
     - You know what, will?

19:57.463 --> 19:58.696
      Maybe we should just
         call it a day.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.231
      - I'm sorry, marcus.

20:00.233 --> 20:02.466
       - Right this way,
           miss loeb.

20:02.468 --> 20:04.235
     - You stay right here.
          I got this.

20:04.237 --> 20:06.704
      Hey, miss lisa loeb,
        miss lisa loeb.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.673
  I'm so sorry to bother you,
           so sorry.

20:08.675 --> 20:10.441
     Listen, my best friend
          over there,

20:10.443 --> 20:13.578
     It's our manniversary.
   He is a huge fan of yours,

20:13.580 --> 20:15.947
      And it would be just
          a huge honor

20:15.949 --> 20:17.748
     If you would give him
         an autograph,

20:17.750 --> 20:19.684
   Or, like, a quick picture.
    - Those are the weirdos

20:19.686 --> 20:21.352
        Who were peeking
        in your trailer.

20:21.354 --> 20:26.757
          - Perverts.

20:26.759 --> 20:29.393
         - Oh, my god,
       that was awesome!

20:29.395 --> 20:30.928
    Lisa loeb winked at me!

20:30.930 --> 20:33.764
 Lisa loeb called us perverts!
            - Yeah!

20:33.766 --> 20:36.701
    Best manniversary ever.
            - Yeah!

20:36.703 --> 20:38.769
        But shouldn't we
           go listen?

20:38.771 --> 20:42.573
- Lisa loeb called us perverts,
  we're not going to top that.

20:42.575 --> 20:45.009
       - ¶ and I thought
    what I felt was simple ¶

20:45.011 --> 20:47.645
      ¶ and I thought that
        I don't belong ¶

20:47.647 --> 20:49.513
             Will.
            - What--

20:49.515 --> 20:51.582
      What are you doing?
    This is not acceptable.

20:51.584 --> 20:52.984
          - I had sex!
             - Ugh.

20:52.986 --> 20:55.019
       Fiona, I told you
     I didn't want to hear

20:55.021 --> 20:56.354
      Anything about this,
             okay?

20:56.356 --> 20:57.622
        - I know, sorry.

20:57.624 --> 20:59.423
             Twice!
   - Oh, stop it, all right.

20:59.425 --> 21:01.459
  Look, I'm very proud of you,

21:01.461 --> 21:03.628
     But we are never ever
    to speak of this again,

21:03.630 --> 21:05.529
       Do you understand?
    - Wait, one more thing.

21:05.531 --> 21:08.466
  ¶ and I know that you don't
          believe me ¶

21:08.468 --> 21:11.035
    ¶ when I say that I had
         a lot of sex ¶

21:11.037 --> 21:13.638
             - Ugh.
    - ¶ but now that I am ¶

21:13.640 --> 21:15.706
        ¶ standing here
   totally had, totally had ¶

21:15.708 --> 21:21.646
       ¶ a lotta, lotta,
          lotta sex ¶

21:21.648 --> 21:24.949
        ¶ t-t-t-twice ¶
           - [groans]
