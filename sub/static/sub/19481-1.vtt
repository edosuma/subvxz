03:38.120 --> 03:39.690
Almost.

03:39.760 --> 03:41.603
"Almost."

03:42.720 --> 03:45.530
Sir, with all due respect,
are you sure this is our best option?

03:45.600 --> 03:46.656
I mean, why can't we just correct

03:46.680 --> 03:49.650
- the problem?
- Because my fuckin' nephew...

03:50.920 --> 03:52.410
killed a dog.

03:54.120 --> 03:55.485
And he stole a car.

03:56.760 --> 03:58.171
A car...

03:59.320 --> 04:02.290
which currently is among our inventory.

04:06.520 --> 04:09.330
So we're giving everything up for a car?

04:11.240 --> 04:12.685
It's not just a car.

04:13.680 --> 04:16.000
It is John Wick's car.

04:17.680 --> 04:19.091
Oh.

04:25.200 --> 04:28.204
Sir, why don't we just give it back?

04:29.400 --> 04:31.323
He killed my nephew.

04:33.120 --> 04:34.201
My brother.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.089
<i>And a dozen of my men.</i>

04:40.400 --> 04:42.323
Over his car.

04:43.600 --> 04:44.965
And a puppy.

04:48.120 --> 04:51.841
And you...
you think he will stop now?

04:51.920 --> 04:53.206
<i>Hmm?</i>

04:56.160 --> 04:58.003
<i>Sir, he's one man.</i>

04:59.000 --> 05:00.570
Why don't we just eliminate him?

05:05.040 --> 05:06.485
John Wick...

05:06.560 --> 05:09.006
<i>is a man of focus...</i>

05:13.200 --> 05:14.486
Commitment...

05:21.480 --> 05:24.324
And sheer fuckin' will.

05:40.680 --> 05:42.409
He once killed three men in a bar...

05:42.480 --> 05:44.881
With a pencil. I know.
I've heard the story.

05:44.960 --> 05:46.530
With a fucking pencil!

05:47.760 --> 05:49.444
Who the fuck can do that?

05:51.920 --> 05:53.445
Well, I can assure you

05:55.240 --> 05:58.289
<i>that the stories you hear about this man,</i>

05:59.280 --> 06:05.367
if nothing else, has been watered down.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.080
...Mr. Wick.

15:48.440 --> 15:49.646
Hey, buddy.

15:56.880 --> 15:59.121
Hey.

16:05.960 --> 16:07.200
Good dog.

16:22.760 --> 16:25.127
<i>- What are you doing, John?
- Looking at you.</i>

16:26.120 --> 16:27.360
<i>What are you doing?</i>

16:27.440 --> 16:28.851
<i>I'm waiting for you.</i>

16:29.880 --> 16:31.041
<i>Come here.</i>

16:46.680 --> 16:47.841
Hey, boy.

17:13.319 --> 17:15.003
Nice peaceful place you got here.

17:16.400 --> 17:18.128
- Hey, Aurelio.
- Hey.

17:22.640 --> 17:25.962
John, what the hell?
I thought you loved this oar.

17:26.960 --> 17:28.246
What do you think?

17:28.319 --> 17:30.800
Well, your motor's
about to fall out and...

17:31.800 --> 17:32.926
the chassis' all bent up,

17:34.000 --> 17:36.002
the... the driveshaft is all destroyed.

17:36.080 --> 17:38.920
And I don't know if you noticed,
but you got a crack in your windshield.

17:39.880 --> 17:42.247
I mean... what do I think?

17:43.760 --> 17:45.171
I could fix this.

17:46.760 --> 17:48.125
Thanks for finding her.

17:48.200 --> 17:51.329
Not a problem, man.
I just made a few calls. No big deal.

17:54.200 --> 17:55.645
Let me know when it's fixed.

17:56.800 --> 18:00.282
All right. It'll be ready Christmas...

18:00.360 --> 18:01.725
2030.

19:40.840 --> 19:41.841
<i>Ciao,</i> John.

19:43.560 --> 19:44.561
Santino.

20:03.560 --> 20:04.686
<i>Café?</i>

20:05.680 --> 20:06.920
<i>Grazie.</i>

20:11.240 --> 20:12.287
Good to see you.

20:13.280 --> 20:14.611
Good to see you.

20:34.680 --> 20:37.001
I was sorry to hear about your wife, John.

20:39.280 --> 20:40.611
Thank you.

20:42.560 --> 20:43.561
Hi.

20:46.680 --> 20:49.251
And the dog,
does he have a name?

20:50.440 --> 20:51.521
No.

21:00.720 --> 21:04.441
Listen, John... with all sincerity...

21:06.520 --> 21:07.851
I don't want to be here.

21:07.920 --> 21:09.604
Please, don't.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.523
I'm asking you not to do this.

21:13.520 --> 21:14.681
I'm sorry.

21:19.400 --> 21:25.362
No one gets out and comes back
without repercussions.

21:27.400 --> 21:30.051
I do this with a heavy heart, John.

21:33.520 --> 21:37.127
But remember, if not for what I did

21:37.200 --> 21:40.283
on the night of your impossible task,

21:40.400 --> 21:44.371
you wouldn't be here right now, like this.

21:44.440 --> 21:47.364
This is because of me.

21:47.440 --> 21:48.965
This, in part, is mine.

21:49.960 --> 21:52.122
Take it back.

21:52.200 --> 21:53.480
- "Take it back"?
- Take it back.

21:54.320 --> 21:57.164
A marker is no small thing, John.

21:58.240 --> 22:00.561
For a man to grant a marker to another,

22:01.640 --> 22:04.166
is to bind a soul to a blood oath.

22:08.280 --> 22:10.169
Find someone else.

22:13.920 --> 22:15.365
Listen to me.

22:15.440 --> 22:16.851
What is this? Hmm?

22:17.840 --> 22:20.320
Do you remember? This is your blood.

22:21.520 --> 22:24.364
You came to me. I helped you.

22:25.560 --> 22:28.211
If you don't do this,

22:28.280 --> 22:30.567
you know the consequences.

22:32.680 --> 22:34.648
I'm not that guy anymore.

22:39.080 --> 22:41.128
You are always that guy, John.

22:45.840 --> 22:47.285
I can't help you.

22:59.520 --> 23:00.931
I'm sorry.

23:14.120 --> 23:16.600
Yes. You're right.

23:17.680 --> 23:18.761
You can't.

23:22.320 --> 23:24.209
But he can.

23:24.280 --> 23:25.930
I'll see you soon, John.

23:38.040 --> 23:40.566
You have a beautiful home, John.

23:42.840 --> 23:44.126
<i>Buenasera.</i>

25:57.560 --> 25:59.528
Well, good evenin', John.

26:00.520 --> 26:01.806
Hey, Jimmy.

26:04.160 --> 26:05.491
Gas leak?

26:07.520 --> 26:09.090
Yeah, gas leak.

26:10.760 --> 26:12.330
You workin' again?

26:15.200 --> 26:16.645
I'll see you, Jimmy.

26:17.840 --> 26:19.729
Come on, boy.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.525
'Night, John.

26:26.800 --> 26:28.245
Oh, shit.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.803
I'd like to see the manager.

27:13.880 --> 27:16.611
How good to see you again so soon,
Mr. Wick.

27:17.680 --> 27:18.886
Shall I announce you?

27:19.880 --> 27:21.245
Yes, please.

27:22.360 --> 27:23.725
Stay.

27:31.560 --> 27:34.086
Mr. Wick is on his way to see you, sir.

27:47.400 --> 27:48.640
Impeccable.

27:50.520 --> 27:53.808
Put these into circulation.

28:07.640 --> 28:08.846
Where is he?

28:10.720 --> 28:12.609
Thank you, my friend.

28:12.680 --> 28:14.762
Beautiful work. Beautiful.

28:22.040 --> 28:23.690
What are you doing, Jonathan?

28:25.080 --> 28:27.287
He burned my house down.

28:27.360 --> 28:30.569
You rejected his marker.
You're lucky he stopped there.

28:31.960 --> 28:33.096
What the hell were you thinking,

28:33.120 --> 28:36.203
giving a marker to a man
like Santino D'Antonio?

28:36.280 --> 28:38.851
It was the only way I could get out.

28:38.920 --> 28:41.844
Oh. You call this "out"?

28:43.680 --> 28:45.967
What did you think was gonna happen?
Huh?

28:46.040 --> 28:47.849
What did you expect? Huh?

28:47.920 --> 28:51.561
Did you really think this day
was never going to come'? Hmm?

28:54.040 --> 28:55.690
What does he want you to do?

28:57.840 --> 28:59.171
I didn't ask.

29:00.160 --> 29:01.366
I just said no.

29:04.480 --> 29:07.086
Two rules that cannot be broken, Jonathan.

29:08.080 --> 29:12.085
No blood on Continental grounds,
and every marker must be honored.

29:13.320 --> 29:16.847
Now while my judgment comes
in the form of <i>excommunicado,</i>

29:17.840 --> 29:19.729
the High Table

29:19.800 --> 29:22.963
demand a more severe outcome
if their traditions are refused.

29:24.520 --> 29:26.204
I have no choice?

29:27.520 --> 29:29.443
You dishonor the marker, you die.

29:29.520 --> 29:31.648
You kill the holder of the marker,
you die.

29:31.720 --> 29:33.882
You run, you die.

29:35.400 --> 29:37.528
This is what you agreed to, Jonathan.

29:38.520 --> 29:40.204
Do what the man asks.

29:41.520 --> 29:42.806
Be free.

29:42.880 --> 29:48.046
Then, if you want to go after him,
burn his house down, be my guest.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.451
But until then...

29:52.200 --> 29:53.361
Rules.

29:54.360 --> 29:57.364
Exactly. Rules.

29:57.480 --> 29:59.721
Without them, we'd live with the animals.

30:08.240 --> 30:09.605
Do you board?

30:10.880 --> 30:13.929
I'm sorry to say, sir,
but this facility does not.

30:15.600 --> 30:21.369
I, however, would be willing to accept
the responsibility, should you wish.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.411
Appreciate that.

30:24.480 --> 30:26.209
Does he have a name, sir?

30:26.280 --> 30:27.281
No.

30:27.360 --> 30:29.522
Good dog.

30:29.640 --> 30:31.324
Stay.

31:34.560 --> 31:37.404
This was my father's collection.

31:38.680 --> 31:42.207
I see little more
than just paint on canvas, of course.

31:44.520 --> 31:46.488
But I do find myself here.

31:48.360 --> 31:49.725
Please.

32:02.720 --> 32:04.051
I didn't want to do this, John.

32:05.040 --> 32:08.567
Had you stayed retired,
I would have respected it.

32:10.680 --> 32:11.761
Look at you.

32:12.920 --> 32:15.127
You're thinkin' about it, aren't you?

32:16.400 --> 32:19.882
You're counting exits... guards...

32:21.720 --> 32:23.563
Could you get to me in time?

32:25.880 --> 32:27.689
How would you do it, I wonder?

32:29.920 --> 32:30.921
That woman's pen?

32:33.440 --> 32:34.441
His cane?

32:36.720 --> 32:37.926
Maybe his glasses?

32:39.040 --> 32:40.610
My hands.

32:41.720 --> 32:45.008
Ah. How exciting.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.729
Yet you know you cannot, can you?

32:49.040 --> 32:52.806
I told you I needed that guy,

32:52.880 --> 32:55.201
the way you are looking at me right now.

32:56.320 --> 32:58.800
I needed the Boogeyman.

32:58.880 --> 33:00.370
I needed John Wick.

33:00.440 --> 33:03.364
Just... tell me what you want.

33:08.720 --> 33:11.246
I want you to kill my sister.

33:13.240 --> 33:14.605
Why?

33:14.720 --> 33:18.008
There are 12 seats at the High Table.

33:19.600 --> 33:22.251
Camorra, Mafia, and 'Ndrangheta.

33:24.160 --> 33:26.162
The Chinese, the Russian.

33:27.480 --> 33:29.528
When my father died...

33:31.120 --> 33:33.248
he willed his seat to her.

33:34.920 --> 33:37.844
She represents Camorra now.

33:37.920 --> 33:40.287
And I can't help but wonder...

33:41.680 --> 33:44.206
what I might accomplish in her stead.

33:46.040 --> 33:51.524
You want me to kill... Gianna D'Antonio?

33:54.240 --> 33:55.446
I could never do it.

33:56.440 --> 33:58.124
She is my blood.

33:58.200 --> 33:59.281
I still love her.

34:00.280 --> 34:01.850
It can't be done.

34:01.920 --> 34:05.481
She's in Rome for her coronation.

34:06.480 --> 34:11.007
- You will take the catacombs in...
- It doesn't matter where she is.

34:11.080 --> 34:16.246
That's why I need the ghost,
<i>lo spettro,</i> John Wick.

34:17.239 --> 34:19.049
That's why I need you.

34:20.159 --> 34:21.400
Do this for me,

34:22.400 --> 34:24.322
and your marker is honored.

34:25.679 --> 34:27.330
What say you?

34:35.120 --> 34:36.963
Never one to waste words.

34:53.520 --> 34:56.000
Fifty-nine, zero, 3.5.

36:59.160 --> 37:00.571
Jonathan!

37:01.960 --> 37:03.325
Julius.

37:05.400 --> 37:07.289
<i>- Ciao.</i>
- Nice to see you.

37:13.080 --> 37:16.289
I fail to recall the last time
you were in Rome.

37:17.600 --> 37:18.840
And here I'd heard

37:19.840 --> 37:21.080
you had retired.

37:22.640 --> 37:23.846
I had.

37:25.080 --> 37:28.607
Then humor me with, uh...
but one question.

37:38.680 --> 37:39.841
No.

37:42.280 --> 37:43.486
All right, then.

37:49.000 --> 37:52.049
One of our finest rooms.

37:56.680 --> 37:57.806
<i>Grazie.</i>

37:59.080 --> 38:00.570
Enjoy your stay.

38:08.080 --> 38:09.081
Mr. Wick.

38:28.560 --> 38:30.130
Is the sommelier in?

38:30.200 --> 38:32.089
I have never known him not to be.

38:48.160 --> 38:49.810
Good afternoon, Mr. Wick.

38:51.400 --> 38:52.686
It's been a long time.

38:52.760 --> 38:54.330
I'd like a tasting.

38:54.400 --> 38:57.404
I am quite excited
to show you something.

38:58.840 --> 38:59.841
First...

39:05.960 --> 39:08.247
<i>Buongiorno, Signor</i> Wick.

39:08.320 --> 39:09.321
<i>Ciao,</i> Angelo.

39:09.400 --> 39:10.845
Welcome back to Rome.

39:13.760 --> 39:14.761
I am.

39:14.840 --> 39:17.923
I know of your past fondness
for the German varietals,

39:18.040 --> 39:22.204
but I can wholeheartedly endorse
the new breed of Austrians.

39:23.200 --> 39:25.931
Glock .34 and .26.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.731
This is the original map
of the D'Antonio estate.

39:29.800 --> 39:32.280
Here, you have all the ancient ruins.

39:34.920 --> 39:38.811
Tell me, Mr. Wick,
is this a formal event or a social affair?

39:38.880 --> 39:42.771
- Social.
- And is this for day or evening?

39:42.840 --> 39:45.081
I need one for day and one for night.

39:45.160 --> 39:46.400
Recontoured grips.

39:47.400 --> 39:50.483
Flared magwell for easier reloads.

39:50.560 --> 39:52.961
And I know you'll appreciate
the custom porting.

39:55.920 --> 39:57.445
What's next?

39:57.520 --> 40:01.161
I need something robust. Precise.

40:01.240 --> 40:04.084
"Robust. Precise."

40:05.360 --> 40:10.764
This is the map of the temple
and catacombs underneath.

40:10.840 --> 40:12.569
- In what style?
- Italian.

40:12.680 --> 40:14.250
- How many buttons?
- Two.

40:14.320 --> 40:16.004
- Trousers?
- Tapered.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.286
How about the lining?

40:17.360 --> 40:18.964
Tactical.

40:20.280 --> 40:24.126
AR-15, 11.5-inch.

40:24.200 --> 40:27.124
Compensated
with an ion-bonded bolt carrier.

40:27.200 --> 40:30.170
Trijicon accupoint
with one-six magnification.

40:30.280 --> 40:34.365
And this is the modern blueprint.

40:34.440 --> 40:37.762
There are one, two, three gates.

40:40.360 --> 40:43.330
Silicon carbide discs.
Ceramic matrices.

40:43.400 --> 40:45.050
Accompanying laminates.

40:45.120 --> 40:46.884
Cutting-edge body armor.

40:46.960 --> 40:50.646
We just sew it between the fabric
and the lining.

40:50.760 --> 40:53.411
Zero penetration. However...

40:54.760 --> 40:56.205
quite painful, I'm afraid.

40:56.280 --> 40:59.648
Could you recommend anything
for the end of the night?

40:59.720 --> 41:01.848
Something big, bold.

41:01.920 --> 41:05.322
May I suggest the Benelli M4?

41:09.880 --> 41:11.928
Custom bolt carrier release
and charging handle.

41:12.920 --> 41:16.208
Textured grips,
should your hands get... wet.

41:19.240 --> 41:21.163
An Italian classic.

41:21.240 --> 41:22.287
Dessert?

41:22.360 --> 41:24.488
Dessert.

41:25.480 --> 41:29.280
The finest cutlery. All freshly stoned.

41:38.880 --> 41:40.291
Well done.

41:40.360 --> 41:42.362
- Could you do a rush order?
- I sure can.

41:42.440 --> 41:44.249
Where would you like to have it sent?

41:44.320 --> 41:45.367
The hotel.

41:45.480 --> 41:47.160
Shall I have everything sent to your room?

41:48.080 --> 41:50.367
- Yes. Thank you.
- Excellent.

41:51.960 --> 41:53.166
Mr. Wick?

41:56.800 --> 41:58.689
Do enjoy your party.

45:53.280 --> 45:54.281
Good evening.

45:55.400 --> 45:57.164
Are you enjoying the party?

46:45.520 --> 46:47.010
Mr. Akoni.

46:52.400 --> 46:54.402
Are you enjoying the festivities?

46:57.560 --> 47:00.450
Please. Sit.

47:04.840 --> 47:06.569
Ms. D'Antonio,

47:06.640 --> 47:08.847
you can't just take
what is rightfully mine...

47:08.920 --> 47:10.126
Nothing was taken.

47:11.280 --> 47:14.727
Those among your own
came to us with these territories.

47:14.800 --> 47:16.370
A knife was pressed to their throats.

47:17.360 --> 47:18.361
Semantics.

47:19.360 --> 47:20.441
Besides...

47:21.440 --> 47:24.762
That blade you speak of was meant
for their children.

47:26.080 --> 47:28.447
They were only meant to watch.

47:29.560 --> 47:33.246
What is yours is now ours, Mr. Akoni.

47:35.320 --> 47:36.481
Now go.

47:39.600 --> 47:41.011
Enjoy the party.

47:42.520 --> 47:44.045
Have some fun.

47:55.280 --> 47:56.805
<i>Sì, signora.</i>

48:42.760 --> 48:44.000
John.

48:45.920 --> 48:47.081
Gianna.

48:53.360 --> 48:58.685
There was a time not so long ago
in which I considered us as friends.

49:02.400 --> 49:03.731
I still do.

49:07.480 --> 49:08.686
Yet here you are.

49:15.920 --> 49:18.002
What brought you back, John?

49:19.440 --> 49:20.851
A marker.

49:22.920 --> 49:24.001
Held by?

49:26.440 --> 49:27.885
Your brother.

49:35.800 --> 49:37.040
Tell me, John.

49:38.040 --> 49:39.565
This marker...

49:41.080 --> 49:42.605
Is it how you got out?

49:45.440 --> 49:46.521
And what was her name,

49:47.520 --> 49:50.171
this woman whose life has ended my own?

49:52.760 --> 49:54.046
Helen.

49:55.080 --> 49:56.241
"Helen."

49:59.400 --> 50:00.925
This Helen...

50:02.840 --> 50:05.923
was she worth the price
that you now seek to pay?

50:12.880 --> 50:14.291
Now...

50:16.840 --> 50:19.286
let me tell you what happens when I die.

50:20.280 --> 50:23.443
Santino will lay claim
to my seat at the Table.

50:24.800 --> 50:26.564
He will take New York.

50:28.600 --> 50:32.969
And you... will have been the one
who gifted it to him.

51:23.520 --> 51:25.841
What would your Helen
think about that, John?

51:45.160 --> 51:47.561
What would your Helen think about you?

51:48.560 --> 51:49.686
Hmm?

52:04.880 --> 52:06.166
Why?

52:11.560 --> 52:13.130
Because...

52:13.200 --> 52:16.443
I lived my life my way.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.162
And I'll die my way.

52:35.200 --> 52:37.965
Do you fear damnation, John?

52:40.000 --> 52:41.161
Yes.

52:47.960 --> 52:49.200
You know,

52:50.200 --> 52:53.727
I always thought I could escape it.

52:55.680 --> 52:57.728
That I'd see it coming.

53:01.320 --> 53:03.288
That I'd see you.

54:16.000 --> 54:17.161
John?

54:22.880 --> 54:24.211
Cassian.

54:26.680 --> 54:27.761
You working?

54:30.280 --> 54:32.089
Yeah.

54:32.160 --> 54:33.161
You?

54:34.600 --> 54:35.761
Yeah.

54:39.200 --> 54:40.361
Good night?

54:43.120 --> 54:44.451
Afraid so.

54:46.640 --> 54:48.210
I'm sorry to hear that.

57:50.200 --> 57:51.611
Loose ends?

57:59.160 --> 58:00.491
Yeah...

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.600
You're not havin' a good night,
are you, John?

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:51.401
Gentlemen!

01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:55.046
Gentlemen!

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:09.044
Do I need to remind you

01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:10.770
that there will be no business

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:13.411
conducted on the Continental grounds?

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:15.927
No, <i>signore.</i>

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:18.366
No, sir.

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:21.161
<i>Bene.</i>

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:27.610
Now, may I suggest a visit to the bar,

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:29.170
so you can calm yourselves.

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:35.170
Gin, wasn't it?

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:37.361
Yes.

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:41.724
Bourbon, right?

01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:44.241
Yeah.

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:12.405
I had a marker.

01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:15.601
Whose?

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:18.210
Her brother.

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:24.521
I see.

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:27.924
You had no choice.

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:35.007
He wants her seat at the Table.

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:38.410
He will get it now.

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:42.606
Yeah.

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:45.401
Yeah.

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:49.445
So you're free.

01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:57.441
Am I?

01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:01.007
No.

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:04.371
Not at all.

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:11.129
You killed my ward.
Someone I was close to.

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:14.965
An eye for an eye, John.

01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:18.045
You know how it goes.

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:21.487
Yeah.

01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:29.569
I'll make it quick.

01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:32.210
I promise.

01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:35.844
I appreciate that.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.082
I'll try and do the same.

01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:50.051
This round's on me.

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:55.481
Consider it a professional courtesy.

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:31.761
No. Thanks.

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:36.562
<i>Hello, John.</i>

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:38.926
<i>I understand if you're upset.</i>

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.731
<i>And I know it might feel personal.</i>

01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:44.087
<i>But what kind of man would I be</i>

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:46.600
<i>if I didn't avenge my sister's murder?</i>

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:49.001
John?

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:09.287
Could you let management know
I'll be checking out in the morning.

01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:50.331
Operator. How may I direct your call?

01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:52.687
- Accounts payable.
<i>- One moment, please.</i>

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:06.536
<i>Accounts payable.</i>

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:07.721
How may I help you?

01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:09.176
<i>I'd like to open an account.</i>

01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:11.601
- Name on the account?
- John Wick.

01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:13.330
<i>Verification?</i>

01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:15.243
<i>9305-05.</i>

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:18.371
<i>State of contract?</i>

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:21.250
- Open.
<i>- Denomination?</i>

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.001
Seven million.

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:26.208
Processing. Please hold.

01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:32.250
- I appreciate the service.
- My pleasure.

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:34.561
You will find safe passage below.

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:40.369
Transportation is waiting for you.

01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:46.608
May you have a safe journey, Mr. Wick.

01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:19.041
Order confirmed.

01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:25.166
- What is this?
- He completed the task.

01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:28.242
The marker is over.

01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:30.241
Mark it.

01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:34.086
If Mr. Wick isn't dead already,

01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:35.491
he soon will be.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.731
Will you mark it, sir?

01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:57.807
You have no idea what's coming, do you?

01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:03.163
I have everyone in New York
looking for him.

01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:05.561
I doubt we will see him again.

01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:09.765
Do you now?

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:14.411
You stabbed the devil in the back

01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:17.723
and forced him back
into the life that he had just left.

01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:22.451
You incinerated the priest's temple.

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:23.721
Burned it to the ground.

01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:28.768
Now he's free of the marker,
what do you think he'll do?

01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:34.051
<i>He had a glimpse of the other side</i>

01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:35.690
<i>and he embraced it.</i>

01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:37.649
<i>But you,</i> Signor <i>D'Antonio...</i>

01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:40.046
took it away from him.

01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:42.525
He was already back.

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:45.206
Oh, he came back for love, not for you.

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:47.760
He owed me. I had every right.

01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:51.764
And now he's coming again.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.411
<i>He did tell you not to do this.</i>

01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:00.086
He did warn you.

01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:03.130
<i>Addio, Santino.</i>

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:11.850
<i>Please notify MTA
personnel of any suspicious activity.</i>

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:21.729
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:25.282
<i>The Broad Street bound C train
is now arriving.</i>

01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:28.205
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:31.648
<i>The Broad Street bound C train
is now arriving.</i>

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:47.367
<i>Next stop, Canal Street.</i>

01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:09.530
<i>This is Canal Street.</i>

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:15.401
<i>This is the Broad Street bound C train.</i>

01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:17.801
<i>Next stop is Rector Street.</i>

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:44.962
<i>This is Rector Street.</i>

01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:52.850
<i>This is the Broad Street bound C train.</i>

01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:56.207
<i>The next stop is Broad Street.</i>

01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:21.727
<i>This is Broad Street.</i>

01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:24.485
<i>This is the last stop
on the southbound C train.</i>

01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:26.767
The blade is in your aorta.

01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:29.047
You pull it out, you will bleed,
and you will die.

01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:32.240
<i>This is the end of the line.</i>

01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:37.327
Consider this a professional courtesy.

01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:40.323
<i>This is Broad Street.</i>

01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:43.529
<i>This is the last stop
on the southbound C train.</i>

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:47.329
<i>This is the end of the line.</i>

01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:26.481
We see things,
we see things.

01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:29.848
The things you see are nightmares, man.

01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:32.002
Like this one time...

01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:36.845
Take me to him.

01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:42.011
Tell him it's John Wick.

01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:01.050
You know, they just...
they put it in everything!

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:03.361
Hey, man. You got a quarter?

01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:56.008
As I live and breathe!

01:25:57.160 --> 01:25:58.650
John Wick.

01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:00.641
The man.

01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:03.165
The myth.

01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:05.686
The legend.

01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:09.048
You're not very good at retiring.

01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:10.804
I'm workin' on it.

01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:15.442
Mr. Wick doesn't remember,
but we met many years ago,

01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:17.329
before my ascension...

01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:21.251
When I was just a pawn in the game.

01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:25.811
We met and you gave me a gift,

01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:27.644
the gift that would make me a king.

01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:33.443
You don't remember, but there I was,
standing in an alleyway.

01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:36.690
I didn't even hear you comin'.

01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:42.527
You gave me this.

01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:48.410
Gift from the Boogeyman.

01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:51.926
Perfect for every occasion.

01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:56.807
But you also gave me a choice.

01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:01.766
Pull my gun,
shoot you in the back, and die,

01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:04.047
or keep the pressure on my neck...

01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:06.727
and live.

01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:10.564
And so you see, I survived.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:15.846
No one sneaks up on me anymore,
thanks to you.

01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:20.522
I am all-seeing and all-knowing.

01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:24.642
Then you know why I'm here.

01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:29.726
Santino D'Antonio, yes.

01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:32.406
Your contract went wide, John.

01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:35.369
That's bad for your health.

01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:38.203
What's the number up to now, Earl?

01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:41.727
Seven million dollars!

01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:42.801
Damn!

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:47.004
It's Christmas.
We're going to Applebee's after this.

01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:52.927
I need your help.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.766
You have eyes begging for change
on every corner in the city.

01:27:56.840 --> 01:27:59.047
I'm thinkin' you can find Santino.

01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:03.130
I need you to move me. Underground.

01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:04.486
Get me to him.

01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:08.006
How sweet it is!

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.571
The Boogeyman begging me for help.

01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:13.489
Well, of course, John.

01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:16.171
Yes, John. Whatever you'd like, John.

01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:19.005
Would you like a back rub with that, John?

01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:21.730
You're going to help me.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.207
Why the fuck would I do that?

01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:29.400
Because I'm the only one
that can help you.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.411
You're gonna help me out?

01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:53.364
That's downright upright of you, Mr. Wick.

01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:57.165
You sound positively magnanimous.

01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:00.524
But look around you.

01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:04.082
How much help does it look like I need?

01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:16.043
It seems to me that the real question,
Mr. Wick,

01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:21.330
is who in this cruel world of ours...
is going to help you?

01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:37.361
There's a storm coming.

01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:41.081
Not just for me. For all of us.

01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:43.731
For everyone under the Table.

01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:47.521
Yes, killing someone who has a seat
at the High Table does create a problem.

01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:49.443
But it's your problem, baby.

01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:55.050
After all, none of my people
sent Gianna D'Antonio...

01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:56.764
to the hereafter.

01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:02.171
That being said, Santino has her seat now.

01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:04.446
And he wants the city.

01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:08.523
When he's done uptown,
you think he's gonna stop at 14th Street?

01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:12.524
We'll just have to take care of ourselves.

01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:13.806
Oh, yeah?

01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:16.281
For how long?

01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:17.691
And how much blood?

01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:20.409
You kill Santino,

01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:23.006
the Camorra,
and the High Table come for you.

01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:27.608
I kill Santino, they come for me.

01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:31.645
He's offered $7 million for your life.

01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:36.964
Seven million dollars
is a lot of money, Mr. Wick.

01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:45.128
So I guess you have a choice.

01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:47.929
You want a war?

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.321
Or do you wanna just give me a gun?

01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:05.882
Somebody, please! Get this man a gun!

01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:15.444
Kimber 1911, .45 ACP.

01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:20.525
Seven-round capacity.

01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:30.126
Seven rounds?

01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:34.806
Seven million dollars
gets you seven rounds.

01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:38.368
That's a million dollars a round, baby.

01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:51.081
Let's go.

01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:55.411
Your descent into Hell begins here,
Mr. Wick.

01:31:55.480 --> 01:31:56.720
He's at the museum.

01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:58.450
Earl will guide you.

01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:00.761
Do be careful on your way down.

01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:05.801
Oh, and remember... you owe me.

01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:09.289
You don't want me owing you.

01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:40.646
Welcome, everyone.

01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:43.883
Let us toast to the future
of the High Table

01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:47.123
and of course,
to the memory of my dear sister.

01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:06.089
Nice to see you.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:17.650
Mr. Akoni, how are you?

01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:16.089
Wick is here.

01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:17.161
Yeah.

01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:11.241
You and you, with me. You, go.

01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:29.365
<i>Welcome to
"Reflections of the Soul"</i>

01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:31.727
<i>at the New Modern NYC.</i>

01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:34.884
<i>Within this exhibition,</i>

01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:38.203
<i>the interplay of light
and the nature of self-images</i>

01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:40.248
<i>coalesce to provide an experience</i>

01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:42.482
<i>which will highlight the fragility</i>

01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:46.531
<i>of our perception of space

01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:49.843

we can provide new insights</i>

01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:51.968
<i>into your understanding of the world,</i>

01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:55.567
<i>and just possibly lead you

01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:57.244
<i>into the nature of self.</i>

01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:15.170
The marker is complete, John.

01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:16.844
You should have just run away.

01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:29.647
You know what the Camorra will do to you.

01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:33.203
You think you're Old Testament?

01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:35.611
No, John.

01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:38.961
No.

01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:43.409
Killing me won't stop the contract.

01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:48.966
Killing me will make it so much worse.

01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:53.121
John...

01:37:54.520 --> 01:37:55.726
you know what I think?

01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:00.727
I think you are addicted to it.

01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:01.801
To the vengeance.

01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:22.531

No wife.

01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:32.491
No life.

01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:35.761
No home.

01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:40.681
Vengeance... it's all you have.

01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:44.521
You wanted me back.

01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:46.607
I'm back.

01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:46.168

01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:41.930
Good evening.

01:43:43.720 --> 01:43:45.404
Is the manager in?

01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:48.848
The manager is always in.

01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:54.961
Winston.

01:43:56.640 --> 01:43:57.801
Mr. D'Antonio.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:00.809
Your evening has been colorful, I see.

01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:03.962
Seeking safe harbor, I presume?

01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:07.567
I want his membership revoked. Now.

01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:12.009
In the eyes of this institution,
Mr. Wick has breached no legalities.

01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:14.208
Then you know that I have the right
to demand...

01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:18.524
Nothing.
You demand nothing of me, Mr. D'Antonio.

01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:21.331
This kingdom is mine and mine alone.

01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:26.044
All right.

01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:28.964
Then enjoy your kingdom, Winston,
while you still can.

01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:32.726
And you, its privileges, sir.

01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:48.211
I'm here to see Santino D'Antonio.

01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:54.527
He's waiting for you in the lounge, sir.

01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:47.121
Duck fat.

01:45:47.200 --> 01:45:48.770
Makes all the difference.

01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:51.250
Jonathan...

01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:52.446
Have you seen the menu here?

01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:56.407
- Lot of options.
- Jonathan, listen to me...

01:45:56.480 --> 01:45:59.927
A man can stay here a long time

01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:01.690
and never eat the same meal twice.

01:46:02.680 --> 01:46:06.048
Jonathan, just walk away.

01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:09.321
Yeah, Jonathan.

01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:10.925
Walk a...

01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:20.849
What have you done?

01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:25.881
Finished it.

01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:46.169
How was he?

01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:49.130
He was a good dog.
I have enjoyed his company.

01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:56.169
Let's go home.

01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:33.891
Mr. Wick?

01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:42.522
If you would be so inclined.

01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:17.841
Come on, boy.

01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:29.041
It has been a pleasure, Mr. Wick.

01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:37.371
Good bye.

01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:15.965
Jonathan.

01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:17.201
Winston.

01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:20.166
What am I lookin' at?

01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:24.966
The Camorra's doubled
Santino's open contract.

01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:26.246
It's gone international.

01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:28.766
High Table?

01:50:28.840 --> 01:50:29.841
Mmm-hmm.

01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:32.521
And the Continental?

01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:36.528
You killed a man on company grounds,
Jonathan.

01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:40.400
You leave me no choice
but to declare you <i>excommunicado.</i>

01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:46.291
The doors to any service or provider
in connection with the Continental

01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:48.806
are now closed to you.

01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:54.202
I am so sorry.

01:50:56.240 --> 01:50:58.242
Your life is now forfeit.

01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:02.808
Then why am I not dead?

01:51:04.120 --> 01:51:06.487
Because I deemed it not to be.

01:51:09.480 --> 01:51:10.481
Now.

01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:41.489
You have one hour.
I can't delay it any longer.

01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:44.765
You might need this...

01:51:46.760 --> 01:51:47.761
down the road.

01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:53.401
Winston...

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:56.331
tell them.

01:51:57.480 --> 01:51:59.482
Tell them all.

01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:01.562
Whoever comes,

01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:02.971
whoever it is...

01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:05.491
I'll kill them.

01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:08.130
I'll kill them all.

01:52:11.960 --> 01:52:13.371
'Course you will.

01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:19.171
