00:52.350 --> 00:54.543
Montana to Rice!

00:56.049 --> 00:57.810
- They're on different teams.
- Since when?

00:58.016 --> 00:59.709
When I watched their last game at Carol's.

00:59.916 --> 01:01.779
- But that was way back.
- I'll say.

01:02.216 --> 01:03.772
- Go long.
- Me go long?

01:03.983 --> 01:06.881
- I'm out of shape. You go long.
- I'll go long.

01:09.749 --> 01:12.010
- Too far for the lvy League arm?
- Car!

01:17.115 --> 01:18.172
Hey, you butthead!

01:18.481 --> 01:20.447
What are you, out of your mind?

01:20.882 --> 01:22.404
Not another one!

01:22.615 --> 01:24.604
Go get a gurney, Doug.

01:25.181 --> 01:27.477
I'm not playing catch
with you anymore.

01:28.881 --> 01:31.040
- Nice of them to drop him off.
- What are friends for?

01:31.248 --> 01:33.645
Three-month-old seizing in 1.
Temp's 105.

01:33.847 --> 01:36.870
- I got him, Doug. Go!
- Is Dr. Benton...?

01:38.747 --> 01:40.770
- Give her three more of morphine.
- Five.

01:40.981 --> 01:44.105
- Call X-ray down here, stat.
- Susan, I need you in here.

01:44.313 --> 01:46.370
- What x-rays do you want?
- Move, Carter.

01:46.680 --> 01:48.373
Please, Petey. Oh, it hurts!

01:48.580 --> 01:50.568
Okay, Ma, okay.
Listen, all right?

01:50.779 --> 01:53.041
Get an x-ray of the hip,
chest and pelvis.

01:53.247 --> 01:55.576
- What about a C-spine?
- Get out of here!

01:55.779 --> 01:57.506
Carter, come with me.

01:59.679 --> 02:01.235
Pulse, weak.
He's bleeding.

02:01.446 --> 02:03.809
- Multiple trauma. Gown up!
- O-2, 15 liters.

02:04.012 --> 02:06.205
- What's Benton doing?
- His mom broke her hip.

02:06.412 --> 02:08.707
- That's bad at her age.
- What about labs?

02:08.912 --> 02:12.469
CBC, type and cross 8 units.
Run the saline wide open.

02:12.678 --> 02:14.769
Carter, Deb, the guy's out of it.

02:14.979 --> 02:17.171
Primary survey's done.
Now what do you get?

02:17.378 --> 02:20.173
- Get a CT.
- Narcan, 0.8.

02:20.378 --> 02:22.900
- And then you gotta get the...
- Glucose, 85.

02:23.111 --> 02:25.736
Get smart nurses and nod sagely.

02:27.011 --> 02:30.704
Get her another 5 of morphine.
CBC, Chem-7, UA, EKG...

02:30.911 --> 02:33.399
...hip, chest and pelvis.
Move! Come on!

02:34.510 --> 02:35.703
Don't take it off!

02:35.911 --> 02:38.967
Call the chief of Orthopedics.
Tell him to get down here now!

02:39.177 --> 02:43.075
- We need to undress you, Mrs. Benton.
- Please. Not in front of Petey.

02:43.843 --> 02:46.309
- Peter. Peter.
- What?

02:46.509 --> 02:49.475
She doesn't want to be naked
in front of her son.

02:49.676 --> 02:51.733
Okay. All right, Ma.

02:52.409 --> 02:54.068
I'll be outside, okay?

02:55.676 --> 02:56.971
Here's the blood clav.

02:58.209 --> 02:59.640
I'll be right out here.

03:05.575 --> 03:06.598
He's going down the tubes.

03:06.809 --> 03:09.604
- Can I intubate?
- No. It could be a neck fracture.

03:09.809 --> 03:12.240
Always look everywhere.
We'll roll him.

03:12.442 --> 03:14.499
Ready, and now.

03:16.641 --> 03:19.403
There we go!
Single gunshot wound. And back.

03:19.608 --> 03:20.733
Heart's racing. 180.

03:20.941 --> 03:23.463
- He barely has a pulse.
- Put the blood on a pressure bag.

03:23.674 --> 03:24.867
Cap refill's bad.

03:25.075 --> 03:26.870
- No pulse. He's arrested.
- All right.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.529
Carter, take over CPR.

03:30.608 --> 03:32.937
- We gotta crack his chest.
- I got it.

03:33.140 --> 03:34.901
Thoracotomy tray!

03:36.207 --> 03:38.900
We do a thoracotomy when?

03:39.440 --> 03:43.202
- Penetrating trauma and full arrest?
- Exactamundo!

03:43.940 --> 03:45.803
I need the rib spreader.

03:46.139 --> 03:47.537
Towel, scalpel.

03:48.906 --> 03:50.735
Move your hands, Carter.

03:53.606 --> 03:55.504
Put the blood on the pump.

03:55.873 --> 03:57.463
Rib spreader.

03:58.505 --> 03:59.971
I'm in.

04:00.706 --> 04:01.797
Pericardium's dry.

04:03.072 --> 04:04.129
Aorta...

04:04.339 --> 04:05.464
Statinsky.

04:05.772 --> 04:06.794
Is O.R. On alert?

04:07.005 --> 04:11.528
- They just finished that perfed appy.
- Tell them they've got another customer.

04:12.671 --> 04:14.660
- There it is.
- Nice save, Mark.

04:14.872 --> 04:16.202
Got a faint pulse.
Let's go!

04:18.303 --> 04:19.668
I gotta go.
I'm on tonight.

04:19.872 --> 04:21.838
- I'll have the place emptied out.
- Deal!

04:22.036 --> 04:23.333
You taking the El home?

04:23.538 --> 04:25.629
I'll go with you.
I'm back tonight...

04:25.837 --> 04:28.303
...could you finish the nurse's notes?
- Sure.

04:28.904 --> 04:32.768
Who the hell stat-paged me here
for some old lady with a broken hip?

04:32.971 --> 04:35.368
- I'm Dr. Benton...
- Pulled me out of a meeting.

04:35.570 --> 04:38.001
This is my mother
and she broke her hip, sir.

04:38.203 --> 04:40.362
Well, that she did, Dr. Benton.

04:40.570 --> 04:42.468
Blair, put her on your O.R. Schedule.

04:42.670 --> 04:45.329
No, no. Sir, I want you
to do the surgery.

04:45.537 --> 04:47.093
ER admits go to
the teaching...

04:47.303 --> 04:49.825
I don't want a resident
operating on my mother.

04:50.036 --> 04:52.593
- I'll scrub in.
- So you'll be holding the knife?

04:52.769 --> 04:53.792
I wanna scrub in too.

04:54.003 --> 04:56.491
- I'll be in there.
- That's not good enough.

04:56.703 --> 04:58.464
I know this is your mother...

04:58.669 --> 05:01.896
...but you are way
over the line, son.

05:06.902 --> 05:08.492
I'll page you when we're done.

05:08.702 --> 05:10.793
Now back off.

06:04.565 --> 06:08.657
- So you tried to sand it off?
- Isn't that what you do?

06:08.865 --> 06:11.559
Yeah, but we don't use
a power sander.

06:12.198 --> 06:15.755
Mr. Longet's a diabetic, as well
as an amateur dermatologist.

06:15.965 --> 06:18.453
Vera didn't want me
just crossing it out.

06:19.031 --> 06:22.394
Well, one gram of Ancef.
Update his tetanus.

06:22.598 --> 06:24.587
And get Plastics to see him.

06:24.798 --> 06:27.195
They may have to do a graft.

06:27.397 --> 06:31.386
- They can move that serpent head.
- Onto the body of a goddess?

06:32.663 --> 06:34.186
I'll be right back.

06:37.496 --> 06:40.553
- Did you eat lunch?
- No, the cafeteria's already closed.

06:40.763 --> 06:42.126
- VoilÃ !
- Thank you.

06:42.330 --> 06:44.989
Hey, you're gonna be an ER attending.
Congratulations!

06:45.196 --> 06:47.560
It's not a lock.
Can I borrow your pen?

06:47.762 --> 06:49.523
A lifetime of this, huh?

06:49.729 --> 06:52.161
The ER's great.
Free time's your own.

06:52.362 --> 06:53.521
What free time?

06:53.729 --> 06:57.491
After your residency, you get
skilled in every aspect of medicine.

06:57.696 --> 06:59.662
You see a variety of cases.

06:59.863 --> 07:03.192
You have an immediate effect
upon your patients' lives.

07:03.395 --> 07:07.554
But mainly it's like
joining the circus.

07:46.359 --> 07:49.189
I'm telling you,
the opening goes in the back.

07:49.392 --> 07:52.449
Oh, my God, I'm as big as a house!

07:56.226 --> 07:58.317
- I'm Dr. Mark Greene.
- Sean O'Brian.

07:58.526 --> 07:59.513
I'm Jodi.

07:59.725 --> 08:03.283
- Hop up on that bed.
- I don't think I can hop anywhere.

08:04.092 --> 08:05.183
Easy.

08:05.892 --> 08:07.881
What seems to be the problem?

08:08.091 --> 08:12.251
Our baby's due in two weeks and
I have to pee every 30 seconds.

08:12.458 --> 08:15.083
It burns and my stomach hurts.

08:15.258 --> 08:17.087
Sounds like a bladder infection.
Does this hurt?

08:17.291 --> 08:20.018
No, just don't push too hard.
I gotta go again.

08:24.390 --> 08:28.220
Thirty-six minus four.
Baby's about...

08:28.424 --> 08:31.117
...five or six pounds.

08:31.790 --> 08:34.416
- You have any other medical problems?
- No, no.

08:37.190 --> 08:39.678
- Is that cold?
- Yes.

08:39.890 --> 08:41.879
Let's take a quick listen here.

08:43.289 --> 08:45.255
- I love that sound.
- It's great.

08:46.089 --> 08:47.419
It's great.

08:48.423 --> 08:51.514
- Any cramping? Any vaginal bleeding?
- No.

08:52.622 --> 08:54.520
Can you feel the baby move?

08:55.922 --> 08:58.183
Can you give me a urine sample?

08:58.455 --> 09:00.182
Are you kidding?

09:00.388 --> 09:02.786
Yes, I think I can do that.

09:04.821 --> 09:07.981
I want you to follow my finger
with just your eyes.

09:13.321 --> 09:15.879
Good. Now squeeze
your eyes tight like this.

09:20.454 --> 09:23.648
Great. Okay, press against
my hand with your face.

09:26.020 --> 09:28.451
Great. Okay, show me your teeth.

09:38.553 --> 09:42.178
- Will Grandma be able to walk again?
- Yeah, she'll be fine.

09:47.652 --> 09:51.141
I know what you're thinking, Jackie.
Why don't you just say it?

09:51.953 --> 09:54.851
- Shut up, Peter.
- No, go ahead and say it.

09:55.686 --> 09:58.447
I mean, it's my fault
that this happened, right?

09:58.652 --> 10:01.913
I'm so pigheaded and self-centered.

10:02.385 --> 10:04.680
Just shut up and sit down.

10:17.218 --> 10:18.514
BP's 90 over 60.

10:18.717 --> 10:22.081
I found him in the greenhouse,
passed out in the back.

10:22.284 --> 10:24.909
He visits at my work
and this is the shape he's in.

10:25.117 --> 10:26.673
- Hydrate with saline.
- I don't want to go.

10:26.884 --> 10:28.941
You'll go where I tell you to go.

10:29.150 --> 10:32.378
I am not losing another son
to alcohol and drugs.

10:32.584 --> 10:34.913
She's 38 weeks,
but I think her dates are off.

10:35.116 --> 10:36.548
The baby's small on exam.

10:36.749 --> 10:40.079
Initial BP is 130 over 90,
but over a couple of hours...

10:40.283 --> 10:43.373
...BP's been fine.
Around 120 over 80.

10:43.583 --> 10:46.811
FHT's normal, no cramps or spotting.

10:47.015 --> 10:48.641
I got your test results.

10:48.850 --> 10:51.577
UA shows white cells
too numerous to count.

10:51.782 --> 10:56.044
Bacteria, 2 plus protein.
CBC's normal. No fever.

10:56.249 --> 10:59.271
Simple cystitis. Fluids, rest
and a course of Bactrim.

10:59.481 --> 11:01.674
It's a bladder infection.

11:03.048 --> 11:05.241
- Who are they?
- Med students.

11:06.014 --> 11:09.276
- They're so young.
- I know. It's disgusting, isn't it?

11:09.681 --> 11:13.239
Near-term antibiotic of choice
is Macrodantin.

11:14.181 --> 11:16.738
Now, I want you to take these.

11:16.948 --> 11:18.709
Lots of fluids.

11:19.747 --> 11:22.212
Rest and follow up
with your doctor in the morning.

11:25.147 --> 11:28.977
The sulfas compete with bilirubin
for the binding sites on albumin...

11:29.180 --> 11:31.873
...increasing the risk
of neonatal jaundice.

11:32.080 --> 11:34.841
He saves lives, he teaches,
he slices and dices.

11:35.047 --> 11:37.808
Deb, will you work up
a weak and dizzy in 3, please?

11:38.013 --> 11:41.172
Doctors? Would you sign a get-well card?

11:41.780 --> 11:42.870
Sure.

11:45.479 --> 11:47.671
- Who's this for?
- Me.

11:49.213 --> 11:50.974
- What is it?
- Hemorrhoids.

11:51.146 --> 11:52.134
That's right here.

11:52.345 --> 11:55.243
- Dr. Ross, kid's crashing!
- What?

11:58.078 --> 12:00.805
Alcohol level's down to 0,
his pulse is down 40.

12:01.011 --> 12:04.273
Pupils pinpoint. Haleh, get a BP.
Frothing at the mouth.

12:04.744 --> 12:06.801
- Is it drugs?
- He's incontinent.

12:07.011 --> 12:09.602
- Negative drug screen.
- BP's 70 over 50.

12:09.778 --> 12:10.766
Where do you work?

12:10.978 --> 12:13.205
- Wrigleyville Nursery.
- Nursery, as in school?

12:13.411 --> 12:14.434
No, like in plants.

12:14.611 --> 12:16.440
- Outside or in the office?
- Both.

12:17.244 --> 12:18.869
Mag of atropine, IV push.

12:19.077 --> 12:21.634
Tear off his clothes, wear gloves.

12:21.844 --> 12:25.571
Start a drip. A milligram an hour.
2-Pam. 1 gram over 30 minutes.

12:25.777 --> 12:26.800
What's wrong?

12:26.977 --> 12:29.499
Insecticide poisoning.
What chemicals do you carry?

12:29.710 --> 12:30.937
We use everything.

12:31.143 --> 12:32.938
We were spraying in
the greenhouse today.

12:33.143 --> 12:34.769
- Will he be okay?
- I think so.

12:34.976 --> 12:36.908
I'm gonna call the nursery.

12:40.009 --> 12:42.702
- What do you have?
- Elderly man with hemorrhoids.

12:42.909 --> 12:45.466
Yuck! Everyone's so old
and sick around here.

12:45.676 --> 12:47.835
Yeah. This is a hospital.

12:48.043 --> 12:51.906
- Yeah, I guess. Where's Benton?
- He's in surgery with his mom.

12:52.108 --> 12:54.097
- Hi, guys.
- Working the graveyard?

12:54.309 --> 12:57.706
Seven p.m., no Benton. I may
get home by 8:00, for once.

12:57.908 --> 12:58.999
Somebody help me.

12:59.209 --> 13:01.936
My wife's unconscious in the car.
Dr. Greene!

13:02.575 --> 13:06.132
Please, somebody help me!
She's pregnant. Hurry!

13:07.241 --> 13:09.104
She's passed out.

13:41.206 --> 13:42.763
Freeze right there!

13:43.139 --> 13:45.298
It's my mother.
I wanna scrub in.

13:45.506 --> 13:50.268
You take one more step and I'll
have your ass hanging on my wall...

13:50.472 --> 13:52.767
...right next to your residency.

13:53.206 --> 13:55.728
- I wanna help.
- Don't test me.

13:57.271 --> 13:58.464
Out!

13:59.305 --> 14:03.135
Now divide the iliotibial tract.
Hemosat.

14:18.704 --> 14:20.602
Watch her airway.

14:22.537 --> 14:25.025
Get a stat BP.

14:25.237 --> 14:26.930
Oh, my God! What's going on?

14:27.137 --> 14:29.000
Carter, help Mr. O'Brian.

14:29.204 --> 14:30.601
Mr. O'Brian, we need to work.

14:30.803 --> 14:33.530
- Start a second IV.
- BP's high, 160 over 110.

14:33.736 --> 14:35.167
You're okay, babe!

14:37.902 --> 14:42.494
She's eclamptic! Load her
with mag sulfate, four grams, IV.

14:42.702 --> 14:43.895
Do you need blood?

14:44.102 --> 14:47.932
She needs a Chem-24, a coag panel
and put her on a fetal monitor.

14:48.136 --> 14:50.158
Cap refill's fair.

14:52.268 --> 14:53.757
- Mr. O'Brian?
- Yeah.

14:54.135 --> 14:56.499
- Your wife has eclampsia.
- Is she gonna die?

14:56.702 --> 14:58.826
No, we need to get her admitted and...

14:59.035 --> 15:00.023
She's seizing!

15:00.235 --> 15:02.326
Grab a bite block!
Is the mag in?

15:02.534 --> 15:04.023
- Got it.
- Restrain her.

15:04.235 --> 15:05.996
Do something!
Somebody help her!

15:06.668 --> 15:07.998
Help her.

15:09.634 --> 15:11.122
Push another four mag sulfate.

15:13.267 --> 15:15.130
You'll be okay.

15:15.967 --> 15:17.297
IV's out!

15:17.534 --> 15:19.227
The other one's blown.

15:19.434 --> 15:21.399
I'll throw in an external jugular.

15:23.466 --> 15:25.159
Two migs of Ativan.

15:25.366 --> 15:27.559
- Where's the prep pad?
- Restrain her.

15:36.433 --> 15:37.557
Restrain her.

15:40.099 --> 15:41.325
It's in.

15:45.666 --> 15:47.824
O-2 to 15 liters.

15:52.098 --> 15:54.360
Okay, seizure's stopping.

15:55.665 --> 15:59.290
Let's hyperventilate her. Get
doptones. Let me do a quick pelvic.

15:59.498 --> 16:01.396
Let's get a blood gas.

16:07.298 --> 16:09.889
Fetal heart tones, strong at 140.

16:10.464 --> 16:11.952
- That's good news.
- 30cc's of saline.

16:12.131 --> 16:16.120
Two cm dilated. Eighty percent effaced.
Membrane's intact.

16:17.730 --> 16:19.559
Call upstairs,
see who's on call for OB.

16:19.764 --> 16:21.252
What the hell is going on?

16:21.463 --> 16:24.792
Your wife has a disorder of late
pregnancy known as eclampsia.

16:24.996 --> 16:28.894
The blood vessels spasm,
causing lack of oxygen to the brain...

16:29.096 --> 16:32.619
...which leads to the seizures.
We're relaxing them with medicine.

16:32.830 --> 16:35.455
- What about the baby?
- We'll need to deliver.

16:35.663 --> 16:37.424
- When?
- Soon.

16:37.863 --> 16:39.294
Very soon.

16:39.962 --> 16:40.985
Who's in Trauma 1?

16:41.162 --> 16:43.719
A pregnant woman
with an eclamptic seizure.

16:43.929 --> 16:46.191
She's postdictal but coming around.

16:46.396 --> 16:47.656
BP's stabilized?

16:47.862 --> 16:50.521
Mag sulfate going?
I'll take over. Go home.

16:50.728 --> 16:52.819
I'd like to see her through the OB.

16:53.029 --> 16:55.051
- I can handle it.
- It's not you, it's me.

16:55.261 --> 16:58.557
I saw her earlier
and I diagnosed UTI.

16:58.762 --> 17:01.557
Sent her out and
she seized in the parking lot.

17:01.928 --> 17:04.689
I thought the protein in her urine
was due to cystitis...

17:04.894 --> 17:08.791
...and I blew off one borderline BP.
I'd feel better if I saw her through.

17:12.627 --> 17:15.819
Fundal placenta. Looks okay.

17:16.527 --> 17:19.321
BP, 120 over 70.
That's very nice.

17:21.827 --> 17:24.259
- Look at little Hunter.
- Dermot.

17:24.459 --> 17:26.516
- Jason.
- Patrick.

17:27.492 --> 17:30.220
- Is that a boy or what?
- Four plus turtle sign.

17:30.426 --> 17:31.891
What's that?

17:32.092 --> 17:35.320
Looks like a little head
peeking out right there.

17:36.759 --> 17:40.987
You give a score of zero or two
for each category.

17:41.193 --> 17:44.091
- Movement?
- He seems very active.

17:44.292 --> 17:46.258
Every night, around the same time.

17:47.358 --> 17:48.585
Score two.

17:48.792 --> 17:51.553
Also breathing, tone,
amount of fluid.

17:51.758 --> 17:55.191
He's an eight. Anything less than a six,
then you worry.

17:56.392 --> 17:57.448
You do the AFI.

18:00.192 --> 18:03.419
You divide the abdomen into four.

18:06.558 --> 18:08.989
Find the deepest pockets of fluid...

18:09.191 --> 18:11.986
...without fetal parts
or umbilical cord.

18:12.457 --> 18:13.717
You mark...

18:13.924 --> 18:16.152
...each corner of the quadrant.

18:16.857 --> 18:18.584
Measure and then add up.

18:18.790 --> 18:21.312
Is that what this number is over here?

18:21.523 --> 18:25.250
That's the baby's heart rate.
That should be between 120 and 160.

18:25.456 --> 18:27.046
So 140's perfect.

18:37.622 --> 18:42.486
The baby's in great shape.
Biophysical profile's 8. AFI's 14.

18:42.689 --> 18:46.745
Cervix is favorable. I've got
a non-stress test started.

18:47.389 --> 18:50.946
I feel very comfortable. I've
delivered a couple hundred babies.

18:51.155 --> 18:54.279
It's 9:00, so we'll see you
in about an hour?

18:54.488 --> 18:55.613
What did Coburn say?

18:55.822 --> 18:58.515
She's at St. Luke's,
and she says she'll be here...

18:58.721 --> 19:02.175
...as soon as she's finished
with her repeat C-section.

19:02.388 --> 19:04.251
She wants me to start an induction.

19:04.454 --> 19:06.976
That is, of course,
if I feel comfortable.

19:07.188 --> 19:08.676
She said that?

19:08.921 --> 19:10.648
What a bitch!

19:11.954 --> 19:12.942
Hey, Drake?

19:13.554 --> 19:15.383
- How do things look?
- Great.

19:15.587 --> 19:17.576
BP's have been perfectly normal.

19:17.787 --> 19:20.877
Oh, boy. How can l...?

19:21.086 --> 19:22.211
Excuse me.

19:23.053 --> 19:26.815
- He can't be more than 12 years old.
- He's the OB resident on call.

19:27.719 --> 19:30.207
I just spoke with Dr. Coburn,
our OB attending.

19:30.419 --> 19:33.112
And she agrees that
we need to deliver you soon.

19:33.319 --> 19:36.717
- Will you have to do a C-section?
- I want to deliver naturally.

19:36.919 --> 19:39.646
Your eclampsia's under control,
the baby's good...

19:39.852 --> 19:43.080
...and the cervix is favorable.
I'd say we do a trial of labor.

19:43.718 --> 19:45.082
And if it doesn't work?

19:45.952 --> 19:47.474
I think it will work.

19:48.885 --> 19:50.851
I want to give it a try.

19:52.718 --> 19:54.240
Let's do it!

19:57.485 --> 19:58.780
Excuse me.

20:03.018 --> 20:05.984
Do you feel competent
to handle this without me?

20:06.184 --> 20:10.048
- I think I can muddle through.
- I'll check back with you at 2300?

20:10.250 --> 20:11.341
Roger.

20:12.350 --> 20:16.373
Carol, could you give Mrs. O'Brian
.5 Pitocin IV?

20:16.583 --> 20:20.413
- You're inducing down here?
- We'll start here and then get her up to OB.

20:25.650 --> 20:29.138
- How frequent are the contractions?
- Every 10 minutes or so.

20:29.750 --> 20:32.909
- Okay, let's have Dr. Greene decide.
- You're kidding!

20:33.116 --> 20:35.809
We can't call him Baby X
when we call our parents.

20:36.149 --> 20:39.081
All right.
Let's take a quick look.

20:44.415 --> 20:46.210
It's five centimeters dilated.

20:46.415 --> 20:48.381
Ninety percent effaced.

20:48.582 --> 20:50.411
Station, minus two.
Membrane's intact.

20:50.881 --> 20:52.211
- You wanna look too?
- May I?

20:52.382 --> 20:54.973
Why not? Everybody else
has been poking around in there.

20:57.714 --> 20:58.702
Here.

21:01.514 --> 21:07.378
<i>- Lan, Patrick, Dermot...</i>
- Sounds like the cast of Finian's Rainbow.

21:07.647 --> 21:09.806
- Sorry.
- Hunter?

21:10.014 --> 21:12.276
Hunter O'Brian?

21:14.513 --> 21:16.479
You agree with my assessment?

21:19.513 --> 21:22.377
Your labor's progressing
along nicely and quickly.

21:22.580 --> 21:23.671
The baby's great.

21:23.879 --> 21:27.175
Is it normal for the heart rate
to be going down like that?

21:27.380 --> 21:30.971
As long as it's only briefly,
and it stays over 120.

21:31.180 --> 21:33.236
Jared's on both lists.

21:33.445 --> 21:34.706
It's not my favorite.

21:34.913 --> 21:39.242
Compromise is the soul of marriage.
Jared, it is.

21:41.078 --> 21:42.634
Jared.

21:47.012 --> 21:48.841
- Hope you feel better.
- Thank you.

21:49.045 --> 21:50.635
You're welcome.

21:51.444 --> 21:53.239
The OB case is still here?

21:53.444 --> 21:56.376
They're still busy upstairs.
I gotta call again.

21:56.977 --> 21:59.000
Dr. Greene! Something's wrong.

21:59.211 --> 22:01.972
The baby's heart...
The monitor's down to 90.

22:02.178 --> 22:04.201
It's not supposed to go that low.

22:10.343 --> 22:12.502
Hey, Ma. Hanging in there?

22:13.477 --> 22:14.670
How are you doing?

22:14.876 --> 22:17.706
- Why so long in the recovery?
- She's 76.

22:17.910 --> 22:20.933
- Estimated blood loss?
- 500cc's.

22:21.143 --> 22:22.802
Post-op orders?

22:23.010 --> 22:25.635
She may be your mother,
but she's my patient.

22:25.843 --> 22:28.240
We're taking the O.R. Elevator.

22:28.609 --> 22:30.904
She's going to 604.

22:40.242 --> 22:42.935
It was bound to happen
sooner or later, Peter.

22:54.208 --> 22:56.935
Sweetie, let's try a deep,
cleansing breath.

22:57.141 --> 23:00.231
- Let's exhale on the count of...
- Shut up, Sean!

23:00.440 --> 23:04.031
Call OB and get the FeSS in here.
How are we doing?

23:04.507 --> 23:07.802
- I'll have an epidural.
- Contractions are three minutes apart.

23:08.007 --> 23:10.802
- No kidding!
- Tracing showing decreased activity.

23:11.007 --> 23:12.132
What's that?

23:12.340 --> 23:14.965
The baby's heart rate is reacting
less than it should.

23:15.174 --> 23:18.731
But babies sleep in 20-minute cycles,
so what we want to do...

23:18.940 --> 23:22.030
...is wake him up.
Rise and shine!

23:23.506 --> 23:25.597
There we go.
He was just sleeping.

23:25.806 --> 23:28.567
The heart rate's back up.
Get an ETA on Coburn.

23:29.639 --> 23:33.537
I'm Dr. Urami, anesthesiology.
I'm here to do your epidural.

23:33.739 --> 23:36.227
Yes, please. Let's do that.

23:39.672 --> 23:41.899
- How's that epidural?
- Wonderful.

23:42.105 --> 23:45.333
I'm gonna show these pictures
of Jared to my students.

23:45.539 --> 23:48.369
- Eighth graders?
- You know, like "show and tell."

23:48.571 --> 23:50.128
In math class?

23:50.305 --> 23:53.930
Now we can get a pressure
reading inside the uterus.

23:55.604 --> 23:58.297
This scalp electrode...

23:58.970 --> 24:02.334
...monitors the pulse rate
more exactly.

24:02.504 --> 24:03.730
Enjoying the show?

24:04.104 --> 24:06.127
Yeah. I mean...

24:06.371 --> 24:07.461
...no.

24:07.670 --> 24:10.636
She's eight centimeters dilated,
completely effaced.

24:11.904 --> 24:14.960
- Won't be long.
- There's another decel.

24:16.836 --> 24:19.098
Variable with a late component.

24:20.336 --> 24:25.268
Let's infuse 500cc's normal saline
through the uterine catheter.

24:25.435 --> 24:27.367
- Like a regular IV?
- Yeah.

24:28.069 --> 24:30.660
And we need to get her up to OB.

24:31.502 --> 24:32.967
I'll light a fire under someone.

24:33.169 --> 24:36.135
- Is something wrong?
- No, we're okay.

24:36.636 --> 24:38.601
- Page Coburn again.
- Okay.

24:41.468 --> 24:42.934
Why can't I send her up?

24:43.135 --> 24:46.101
She's inches away
and the epidural's wearing off.

24:46.835 --> 24:49.528
Well, then find Drake!
Hurry up.

24:51.701 --> 24:54.962
Breathe. Breathe.
Wanna try some breathing?

24:55.134 --> 24:56.895
Your fantasy about me
quitting work...

24:57.067 --> 24:59.624
...and staying home to have kids?
Forget it! This is it.

24:59.834 --> 25:02.164
Repetitive lates.
We need to deliver.

25:02.367 --> 25:05.527
- I need to take a look.
- Try some single breaths.

25:09.133 --> 25:12.792
<i>Fully dilated, 100% effaced.</i>
It's time to start to push.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.091
Already?

25:14.300 --> 25:16.697
- Here?
- Here. Carter.

25:16.900 --> 25:18.832
Run and get Carol.

25:20.800 --> 25:22.823
Try some breathing!

25:23.033 --> 25:26.430
I love you so much, babe.
So much!

25:27.366 --> 25:29.093
Shut up!

25:31.199 --> 25:35.029
Get a baby warmer and a newborn
resuscitation tray in 3, stat!

25:37.298 --> 25:39.730
Nine, ten!

25:39.932 --> 25:41.522
Take a breath, take a breath.

25:41.732 --> 25:43.527
- Welcome back.
- Did I go home?

25:43.732 --> 25:46.425
Push! One, two, three...

25:49.231 --> 25:51.220
Eight, nine, ten!

25:51.430 --> 25:53.226
I'm not ready to be a mother.

25:53.430 --> 25:55.658
- Bear down.
- I can't! It's gonna rip me apart.

25:55.864 --> 26:00.421
One, two, three, four...

26:01.130 --> 26:04.426
I can't! I can't!
Get it out!

26:05.164 --> 26:10.562
Carter! Go up to OB and drag Drake down.
Tell him to bring some forceps. Go!

26:10.763 --> 26:11.854
She's not progressing.

26:12.063 --> 26:15.029
The baby's rate is low.
I'll start the pudendal block.

26:15.229 --> 26:16.718
Okay, I'll gown up.

26:25.263 --> 26:29.319
- OB's got C-sections and deliveries.
- No one will blame you if you wait.

26:29.529 --> 26:32.222
- The monitor says now.
- Why put your ass on the line?

26:32.428 --> 26:34.894
I've come this far,
I'm gonna see it through.

26:35.095 --> 26:36.686
- Where's Coburn?
- In transit.

26:37.262 --> 26:38.887
What, is she coming by camel?

26:39.529 --> 26:41.051
Get her BP.

26:43.594 --> 26:45.992
BP's still climbing.
150 over 100.

26:46.195 --> 26:48.024
Go, Mark. Baby's bradying down.

26:48.227 --> 26:50.216
Now don't push.
Don't push.

26:50.427 --> 26:54.189
Before I break the plates,
cut a median episiotomy.

26:57.461 --> 26:58.687
Here comes the head.

27:02.460 --> 27:04.222
- Get a blanket ready.
- Damn!

27:04.426 --> 27:05.722
- Get him out!
- He's stuck.

27:05.927 --> 27:07.517
- Shoulder dystocia.
- What's that?

27:07.727 --> 27:09.590
Shoulder's hung up on the pubic bone.

27:12.326 --> 27:13.985
Oh, my God!

27:14.493 --> 27:15.856
Lead's off.

27:17.592 --> 27:18.615
McRobert's maneuver.

27:19.326 --> 27:22.553
- Push her legs up towards her head.
- Lift your legs.

27:23.259 --> 27:24.623
Straight up in the air.

27:24.826 --> 27:26.724
Somebody push on the abdomen.

27:26.926 --> 27:29.517
- What are you doing?
- Trying to free his shoulders.

27:29.992 --> 27:33.152
Carter, not fundal pressure.
Down here. Down here.

27:36.225 --> 27:38.316
It's jammed! Stat page OB!

27:38.491 --> 27:39.889
Oh, my God, do something!

27:40.892 --> 27:42.448
Let's try a Woods.

27:42.658 --> 27:44.453
I need to extend the episiotomy.

27:47.758 --> 27:50.189
If I can rotate
the posterior shoulder...

27:50.724 --> 27:51.849
I love you, baby.

27:52.057 --> 27:54.716
Try to deliver
the posterior shoulder.

27:56.291 --> 27:58.722
He's jammed in. Come on.

27:58.891 --> 28:00.618
Come on! Come on!

28:00.857 --> 28:02.584
Why can't you deliver this baby?

28:02.791 --> 28:04.051
Mr. O'Brian, please.

28:10.457 --> 28:12.786
It's not working.
Let her go.

28:12.990 --> 28:14.649
Let her go. It's not working.

28:15.723 --> 28:17.154
Zavenelli.

28:17.356 --> 28:18.379
What are you doing?

28:18.589 --> 28:20.578
We gotta push the baby back in.

28:20.790 --> 28:21.880
Then what?

28:22.089 --> 28:24.453
We're almost through.

28:24.656 --> 28:28.678
Susan, get your hand in here.
Grab a cesarean tray. Run!

28:30.822 --> 28:34.276
Climb on up, hold her head in.
Throw a sheet over her.

28:34.488 --> 28:36.386
Get her into Trauma 1.

28:37.121 --> 28:39.848
Find out if Benton's still here.
Splash and crash.

28:42.988 --> 28:46.113
- Where are you taking her?
- We gotta do an emergency C-section.

28:46.321 --> 28:49.480
- Have you done this before?
- I've scrubbed in many times.

28:49.687 --> 28:50.710
I want somebody else!

28:50.888 --> 28:53.479
If we wait five more minutes,
your baby's brain dead.

28:53.687 --> 28:55.812
Oh, my God. Go, go!

28:56.087 --> 28:57.280
Do it!

28:58.554 --> 29:01.281
Please get out of the way.
Let them work.

29:02.553 --> 29:03.849
I love you so much.

29:04.053 --> 29:06.348
We're almost home.
We're almost out of here.

29:09.586 --> 29:10.574
Call Respiratory.

29:11.653 --> 29:13.050
Mr. O'Brian, wait outside.

29:13.253 --> 29:14.446
I love you!

29:14.653 --> 29:17.517
I'm right here. I'm right here.

29:23.219 --> 29:25.117
BP's sky high. 170 over 120.

29:25.318 --> 29:27.307
- What about anesthesia?
- No time.

29:27.552 --> 29:29.313
I'll throw in a local.

29:29.585 --> 29:32.210
- She's seizing!
- Grab the bite block.

29:33.851 --> 29:35.579
Let's paralyze and intubate.

29:35.785 --> 29:38.979
Versed, four migs. Norcuron, 10.

29:39.684 --> 29:41.343
Intubation tray.

29:41.751 --> 29:44.774
- Get Respiratory down here.
- 7.5.

29:46.718 --> 29:49.343
Suction standing by.

29:49.551 --> 29:51.517
O-2 at 15.

29:51.950 --> 29:54.542
Carter, try and get in here.

29:55.817 --> 29:58.045
We're just gonna bag her for now.

29:59.151 --> 30:02.412
Get that typed blood
cross-matched and down here.

30:02.617 --> 30:04.879
- Where's that coag panel?
- Get a vent ready.

30:05.083 --> 30:07.878
BP's 200 over 130!

30:11.016 --> 30:14.448
Everybody just take
a deep breath, all right?

30:18.549 --> 30:21.310
Hydralazine, 10 migs.

30:22.749 --> 30:25.738
Another bolus of mag sulfate.

30:26.415 --> 30:30.813
Somebody call NICU
and get somebody down here...

30:31.015 --> 30:32.640
...for the baby.

30:34.515 --> 30:37.572
Somebody physically go up to the OB...

30:37.782 --> 30:42.339
...and drag somebody
down here, okay? Go!

30:47.814 --> 30:49.507
Get the suction in.

30:50.647 --> 30:52.079
Scalpel.

30:53.214 --> 30:54.577
Let's see.

30:55.247 --> 30:57.145
Is that the fascia?

30:57.647 --> 30:58.907
Yeah, that looks right.

30:59.113 --> 31:02.671
- Grab with those clippies.
- Hydralazine's in.

31:03.580 --> 31:04.670
Grab an army, navy.

31:04.880 --> 31:07.073
- Suction.
- Metz.

31:09.113 --> 31:10.738
The long scissors.

31:12.379 --> 31:13.777
Retract there.

31:15.546 --> 31:19.239
- I'm in.
- Isn't there something about a bladder flap?

31:20.513 --> 31:21.876
- Pickups.
- Suction.

31:22.079 --> 31:24.136
- I'm dividing the peritoneum.
- Hemostat.

31:24.312 --> 31:25.675
Okay, we're in.

31:26.378 --> 31:28.140
Grab that side and pull.

31:30.445 --> 31:31.968
Get a retractor in there.

31:32.178 --> 31:33.405
We need exposure. Pull!

31:34.245 --> 31:35.233
Oh, man!

31:36.512 --> 31:38.307
That's wide enough.

31:38.744 --> 31:40.710
All right. Now, scalpel.

31:41.644 --> 31:43.906
Cut across the lower segment
of the uterus.

31:44.711 --> 31:45.699
You're asking me?

31:46.344 --> 31:48.139
I'm asking God.

31:48.611 --> 31:50.372
Suction. No, here.

31:50.577 --> 31:53.042
- You're not all the way through.
- I don't wanna cut the baby.

31:53.377 --> 31:55.706
Open a pack of lap pads.

31:56.843 --> 31:58.070
Retract this way, more.

32:00.610 --> 32:03.269
- There, I think I'm in.
- Oh, my God.

32:03.443 --> 32:05.136
There's two liters in there.

32:05.510 --> 32:08.203
- She's got an abruption!
- She's bleeding out!

32:08.409 --> 32:10.705
- Gown up!
- Get the baby out!

32:11.243 --> 32:12.799
Open those IV lines.

32:13.409 --> 32:15.136
Hurry, Mark. Get him out!

32:15.343 --> 32:17.831
- Get the baby.
- Pump in saline.

32:18.042 --> 32:21.633
Forget that cross-match!
Eight units O-neg down here, stat!

32:21.842 --> 32:24.672
- Hurry up.
- I've got him. He's big.

32:25.408 --> 32:27.873
- Suction his airway.
- BP's okay, 120 over 80.

32:28.041 --> 32:29.632
- Come out.
- Hurry up.

32:32.008 --> 32:33.667
The cord's free.

32:33.875 --> 32:34.966
Suction his nose.

32:37.208 --> 32:38.366
Umbilical clamp.

32:42.608 --> 32:43.631
He's not breathing.

32:50.141 --> 32:51.606
Okay, clamp.

32:51.807 --> 32:53.273
All right, bag him.

32:53.473 --> 32:55.133
Carter, get in here.

32:57.473 --> 33:00.496
Get in here.
Follow my hand down.

33:01.939 --> 33:03.064
Feel the aorta?

33:03.273 --> 33:05.068
- It's pulsing.
- Yeah, I do.

33:05.273 --> 33:07.296
- Push down on it. Got it?
- I think so.

33:07.507 --> 33:09.836
- Don't think, do.
- I got it.

33:10.039 --> 33:13.096
- Is he alive?
- BP's holding. 110 over 70.

33:13.305 --> 33:15.033
Move, move!

33:15.239 --> 33:16.933
Start CPR.

33:17.139 --> 33:18.730
I'm gonna intubate.

33:23.339 --> 33:26.237
- Heel stick a glucose.
- Tone is flaccid.

33:26.838 --> 33:28.428
We need a blood gas.

33:28.772 --> 33:30.931
- I can't see. Suction!
- O-neg's here.

33:32.105 --> 33:33.764
All right, pump it in.

33:34.605 --> 33:36.298
I think I'm in.

33:39.605 --> 33:40.797
Bag him.

33:42.004 --> 33:43.402
Quick listen.

33:44.837 --> 33:48.599
- Chest expands while we're bagging.
- Okay, we got it.

33:48.804 --> 33:50.599
Tape it and keep bagging.

33:50.804 --> 33:52.736
Blood sugar's 20.

33:53.303 --> 33:55.030
Give him D-10.

33:55.470 --> 33:58.231
- He's got no veins.
- Hyperventilate him.

33:58.437 --> 34:00.766
I'm gonna try an umbilical line.

34:00.970 --> 34:02.197
What about some epi?

34:02.536 --> 34:05.832
0.04 epi down the tube.

34:06.036 --> 34:07.592
Here's the epi.

34:14.335 --> 34:17.268
Release that clamp
after I tie this off.

34:19.069 --> 34:20.659
Release the clamp.

34:22.534 --> 34:24.592
Oh, my God. How can you see?

34:24.802 --> 34:26.233
I don't know.

34:27.301 --> 34:28.289
Grab a bag of O-neg.

34:28.735 --> 34:30.927
Stick the pins per kilo.

34:32.934 --> 34:34.297
40cc's.

34:35.268 --> 34:36.630
Come on.

34:41.734 --> 34:45.291
That's the umbilical vein.
Hook it up while I advance it.

34:45.900 --> 34:47.889
Okay, it's going.
Glucose at...

34:48.100 --> 34:49.998
...5 mil per kilo.

34:50.199 --> 34:51.790
Follow me down.

34:52.733 --> 34:54.222
20 mils.

34:54.733 --> 34:57.756
Come on, little guy.
Come on.

34:58.266 --> 34:59.596
He moved!

34:59.800 --> 35:01.027
It's going. 100!

35:01.233 --> 35:03.324
- Re-gown me.
- He's pinking up!

35:04.032 --> 35:06.123
She's had three units,
two liters, saline.

35:06.333 --> 35:09.628
- Vitals?
- BP's 80 over 50. Pulse, 112.

35:09.832 --> 35:11.855
I can live with that and so can she.

35:12.066 --> 35:15.089
- Baby's Apgar's much better. Eight.
- That's good.

35:15.298 --> 35:17.730
- Re-gown, Susan.
- Look who's here.

35:17.932 --> 35:19.625
What's going on in here?

35:19.832 --> 35:22.093
I intubated. Baby went bad.

35:23.332 --> 35:26.628
I tried forceps and got
a shoulder dystocia. She seized.

35:26.831 --> 35:29.024
I paralyzed and did a crash section.

35:29.232 --> 35:31.357
There were two liters
of blood in her uterus.

35:31.564 --> 35:33.553
- You knew she'd abrupted?
- Once I got in.

35:33.765 --> 35:36.925
- Baby nearly died.
- Who's this? And what's he doing?

35:37.131 --> 35:39.689
John Carter, med student.
I'm pressing the aorta.

35:39.897 --> 35:41.863
It's a mess!
What'd you use, a chain saw?

35:42.064 --> 35:44.553
I couldn't stand around waiting
while that baby died.

35:44.764 --> 35:48.162
Get an NICU transport team
and the OB resident on call.

35:48.364 --> 35:51.057
You should've let me know
you were in over your head.

36:08.263 --> 36:14.593
We've got hemostasis.

36:15.829 --> 36:17.590
Someone call Respiratory.

36:20.028 --> 36:22.892
Okay, Carson.
You can let go of the aorta.

36:23.895 --> 36:25.326
Wait! Wait!

36:26.195 --> 36:27.990
Stop, stop.

36:28.394 --> 36:31.087
Looks good. Bleeding's stopped.

36:31.294 --> 36:33.192
Go talk to the father.

36:42.027 --> 36:43.322
Suction.

36:46.594 --> 36:48.617
- Is my baby okay?
- He was apneic at first.

36:48.827 --> 36:50.258
But his Apgar's encouraging...

36:50.460 --> 36:54.687
- Stop hiding behind that medical crap!
- Your baby's gonna be fine.

36:54.893 --> 36:57.052
Don't take my son!

36:57.260 --> 36:58.486
And Jodi?

36:58.693 --> 37:01.921
There was bleeding. She's had
transfusions, but she's stabilized.

37:02.127 --> 37:04.456
Dr. Coburn is in there with her now.

37:04.659 --> 37:06.750
- She's closing the incision.
- How can this happen?

37:06.959 --> 37:11.051
What we need to do now
is get your son upstairs. Now! Go!

37:11.259 --> 37:14.225
- Everything's okay, right?
- Go be with your baby.

37:14.426 --> 37:18.721
- She'll be okay, right?
- She's stabilized. Go with your son.

37:26.858 --> 37:28.983
I've never seen
such a chain of errors.

37:29.191 --> 37:31.316
- I did what you said.
- You miss preeclampsia!

37:31.524 --> 37:34.490
- You underestimate the fetal weight.
- I expected OB backup!

37:34.691 --> 37:36.418
You miss a placental abruption!

37:36.624 --> 37:38.783
Blood clot. Right there!

37:38.991 --> 37:42.218
You do an ill-advised forceps
delivery on a baby that's too big.

37:42.424 --> 37:44.583
Then you do a hack job
of a C-section!

37:44.790 --> 37:47.620
It was me in the barrel
with a baby down the tubes.

37:47.823 --> 37:50.255
What saved you
from disaster was dumb luck.

37:50.456 --> 37:53.150
If not for me, the mother'd be dead
and the baby a vegetable!

37:53.356 --> 37:55.652
- Who's on OB call?
- Drake.

37:57.890 --> 38:01.344
- She's just covering herself.
- She was right. It was my screwup.

38:01.556 --> 38:03.919
You were great.
I couldn't have done it.

38:04.123 --> 38:07.055
It was my fault that she went sour.
She's my patient.

38:07.256 --> 38:10.279
- No one will blame you.
- No, they don't have to.

38:10.489 --> 38:12.250
She's crashing!

38:15.355 --> 38:18.980
- How many units has she had?
- BP's falling. 70 over 40.

38:20.021 --> 38:22.317
- I can't get a blood gas.
- Run a resuscitation.

38:22.522 --> 38:25.851
- Cap refill's bad.
- I'll throw in an arterial line.

38:26.055 --> 38:29.384
- Put blood bags on a rapid infuser.
- Get the kit!

38:29.588 --> 38:31.520
Hook up the transducer.

38:32.321 --> 38:35.549
Give her a mig of atropine.
Check a manual BP.

38:35.755 --> 38:37.414
She's bleeding from the puncture.

38:37.621 --> 38:39.711
- Somebody put pressure on it.
- I got it.

38:41.321 --> 38:44.514
- IV site's oozing too.
- I don't hear it. 65 palp.

38:44.720 --> 38:46.515
Hang a dopamine drip.

38:46.720 --> 38:48.515
Pull her off that respirator
and bag her.

38:48.720 --> 38:51.515
Blood's stopped clotting.
She's going into DIC!

38:51.720 --> 38:55.516
Oh, damn! Order 10 units,
cryoprecipitated platelets.

38:55.720 --> 38:58.379
- Multifocal PVCs!
- What now?

38:58.586 --> 39:01.814
Lidocaine, 100 migs, IV push.
Start a drip.

39:03.786 --> 39:06.718
Mark the time: 0542.
Charging 260.

39:10.152 --> 39:11.448
Clear!

39:14.285 --> 39:16.648
300. Clear!

39:16.852 --> 39:20.875
- She's oozing from every cut surface.
- We're chasing our tails in here.

39:21.185 --> 39:23.173
- Time down?
- 33 minutes.

39:23.585 --> 39:25.448
More PVC.
She's maxed out on lidocaine.

39:25.651 --> 39:28.640
Add Pronestyl, 30 migs a minute,
up to 200.

39:28.951 --> 39:31.349
- No pulse. We're losing her!
- Get a dopamine drip.

39:31.551 --> 39:34.039
- Charging to 300.
- Out of the way!

39:39.283 --> 39:40.749
Again. 360.

39:46.850 --> 39:49.907
- Give her 300, IV push.
- Blood gas is bad, 302 over 50.

40:11.149 --> 40:13.706
It's been five minutes
since her last epi.

40:13.915 --> 40:15.505
Another seven.

40:16.815 --> 40:19.212
Mark, she's gone.

40:19.415 --> 40:21.846
It's thirty minutes past too late.

40:22.215 --> 40:23.613
I'm calling it.

40:23.814 --> 40:25.474
Time of death:

40:26.081 --> 40:28.240
0646.

40:37.147 --> 40:40.909
It's not flatlined. It's fine V-fib.
Another 7 migs epi.

43:41.337 --> 43:42.859
Dr. Greene.

43:51.936 --> 43:53.061
I...

43:54.002 --> 43:58.957
...just wanted to tell you that...

43:59.802 --> 44:02.962
...I thought what you did
was a heroic thing.

44:25.601 --> 44:28.760
It's one stop the other way,
right by the station.

44:28.967 --> 44:30.762
- I gotta get going.
- Come on!

44:31.000 --> 44:33.398
Not only does Shorty's
have the greasiest eggs...

44:33.600 --> 44:36.327
...stuff falls from the ceiling
when the El goes by.

44:36.533 --> 44:39.795
Sounds attractive, Susan.
I got a million things to do.

44:40.067 --> 44:41.657
Are you sure you're okay?

44:41.867 --> 44:43.196
I'm fine.

44:43.467 --> 44:44.955
Scout's honor.

44:45.300 --> 44:47.027
Is Jen home?

44:48.305 --> 44:54.326
