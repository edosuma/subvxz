01:51.932 --> 01:53.266
Ohh.

01:54.643 --> 01:56.602
Come on, Toto.

02:01.233 --> 02:02.817
She isn't coming yet, Toto.

02:02.985 --> 02:04.068
Did she hurt you?

02:04.236 --> 02:05.820
She tried to, didn't she?

02:05.988 --> 02:09.031
Come on, we'll go tell Uncle Henry and Auntie Em.

02:16.915 --> 02:18.666
Auntie Em. Auntie Em.

02:20.043 --> 02:21.794
Auntie Em. Just listen
to what Miss Gulch did to Toto.

02:21.962 --> 02:23.754
Dorothy, please. We're trying to count.

02:23.922 --> 02:25.548
But Aunt Em. She hit him over the--

02:25.716 --> 02:27.174
Oh, don't bother us now, honey.

02:27.342 --> 02:28.801
This old incubator's gone bad...

02:28.969 --> 02:31.762
...and we're likely to lose a lot of our chicks.

02:31.930 --> 02:33.472
Oh, the poor little things.

02:33.640 --> 02:36.058
All right, come on now, let's go.

02:36.226 --> 02:38.019
There you go.

02:58.624 --> 03:01.959
Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Thanks, Jer.

04:16.368 --> 04:19.036
Auntie Em, Miss Gulch said
she was gonna take Toto away.

04:19.204 --> 04:20.954
She said she was gonna get the sheriff.

04:21.123 --> 04:24.208
- Dorothy, please.
- Oh, all right.

04:30.966 --> 04:32.925
Oh. Oh. Oh!

04:43.228 --> 04:44.562
Dorothy.

04:44.730 --> 04:46.939
Oh, get me out of here.

04:52.696 --> 04:55.114
- Are you all right, Dorothy?
- I'm all right.

04:55.282 --> 04:58.909
Tom, Jerry. Thanks ever so much.

05:02.289 --> 05:05.166
What's all this jabberwopping
when there's work to be done?

05:05.333 --> 05:08.169
Thank you, boys. I'm much obliged.

05:08.795 --> 05:11.964
Auntie Em, you know what Miss Gulch
said she was gonna do to Toto?

05:12.132 --> 05:13.174
Now, Dorothy, dear...

05:13.341 --> 05:15.760
...you always get yourself into a fret over nothing.

05:15.927 --> 05:18.262
Just help us out today and find yourself a place...

05:18.430 --> 05:20.181
..where you won't get into any trouble.

05:20.348 --> 05:22.057
Yes, ma'am. Come on, Toto.

05:23.435 --> 05:27.146
Boys, I know you two like to tussle,
but will you promise me something?

05:27.981 --> 05:30.274
Promise me you'll be friends and work together...

05:30.442 --> 05:32.568
...to keep an eye on Dorothy.

05:33.236 --> 05:35.988
Please, boys, you're awfully good
at looking after her.

05:36.406 --> 05:39.200
She needs someone to protect her, and Toto, too.

05:39.367 --> 05:40.826
Promise me you'll do that.

05:48.752 --> 05:49.835
Thank you, boys.

05:50.003 --> 05:52.755
Now, you stay close to Dorothy.

05:54.674 --> 05:56.967
Do you suppose there is such a place, Toto?

05:57.594 --> 05:59.136
There must be.

05:59.304 --> 06:02.848
It isn't a place you can get to by a boat or a train.

06:03.016 --> 06:05.184
It's far, far away.

06:05.352 --> 06:08.813
Behind the moon. Beyond the rain.

06:08.980 --> 06:15.319
Somewhere over the rainbow

06:15.487 --> 06:19.865
Way up high

06:20.033 --> 06:23.828
There's a land that I've heard

06:25.205 --> 06:30.292
Of once in a lullaby

06:31.044 --> 06:37.049
Somewhere over the rainbow

06:37.217 --> 06:41.470
Skies are blue

06:41.888 --> 06:44.807
And the dreams that you dare

06:47.394 --> 06:52.815
To dream really do come true

06:53.733 --> 06:57.361
Someday I'll wish upon a star

06:57.529 --> 06:59.405
And wake up where the clouds

06:59.573 --> 07:04.577
Are far behind me

07:05.745 --> 07:08.372
Where troubles melt like lemon drops

07:08.540 --> 07:11.083
Away above the chimney tops

07:11.251 --> 07:12.751
That's where

07:12.919 --> 07:19.425
You'll find me

07:20.594 --> 07:26.640
Somewhere over the rainbow

07:26.808 --> 07:30.436
Bluebirds fly

07:32.480 --> 07:38.110
Birds fly over the rainbow

07:38.653 --> 07:41.030
Why then

07:41.448 --> 07:47.953
Oh, why can't I?

07:57.797 --> 08:02.176
If happy little blue birds fly

08:02.344 --> 08:05.471
Beyond the rainbow

08:05.639 --> 08:09.016
Why, oh, why

08:09.184 --> 08:15.689
Can't I?

08:25.992 --> 08:30.079
Mr. Gale. I want to see you and your wife
right away about Dorothy.

08:38.171 --> 08:40.923
That dog is a menace to the community.

08:41.091 --> 08:44.343
I'm taking him to the sheriff
to make sure he's destroyed.

08:53.645 --> 08:56.146
No, no. I won't let you take him.

08:56.564 --> 08:58.232
You go away, you wicked old witch.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.359
We can't go against the sheriff, Dorothy.

09:00.527 --> 09:01.860
Put him in the basket, Henry.

09:02.028 --> 09:04.321
Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let her take Toto.

09:04.489 --> 09:06.615
Don't let her take him.

10:05.759 --> 10:06.925
What in the world?

10:07.093 --> 10:08.427
I know you two.

10:08.595 --> 10:11.597
You're that Tom and Jerry from the Gale farm.

10:11.765 --> 10:13.432
I'll teach you to get in my way.

10:13.600 --> 10:14.683
Take that.

10:14.851 --> 10:16.643
And that.

10:26.905 --> 10:29.948
Get off.

10:42.462 --> 10:44.713
I'll get you, Tom and Jerry.

10:44.881 --> 10:47.216
And that little dog, too.

10:50.887 --> 10:53.138
Toto, you came back.

10:53.306 --> 10:55.140
Oh, I'm so glad.

10:55.308 --> 10:57.142
Miss Gulch will be coming back for you.

10:57.310 --> 10:58.560
We've got to get away.

10:58.728 --> 11:00.938
We've got to run away.

11:04.901 --> 11:07.986
It's a twister, it's a twister.

11:08.154 --> 11:09.446
Get the horses up.

11:09.614 --> 11:13.408
Dorothy.

11:26.422 --> 11:29.007
Jiminy Crickets. Thanks again.

11:29.175 --> 11:31.009
Come on.

11:32.470 --> 11:34.012
Dorothy.

11:34.180 --> 11:35.389
Dorothy, where are you?

11:35.557 --> 11:39.017
It's too late, we can't look for her now.

11:40.395 --> 11:42.938
Auntie Em. Auntie Em.

11:43.815 --> 11:45.232
You keep trying the door.

11:45.400 --> 11:48.569
Auntie Em. Uncle Henry.

13:54.612 --> 13:56.196
Look out, mouse.

13:56.364 --> 13:58.156
You won't eat me, cat.

13:58.324 --> 13:59.992
Put 'em up, put 'em up.

14:09.002 --> 14:13.338
Watch it. There's more where that came from.

14:17.427 --> 14:19.803
You mean that thing is with you?

14:19.971 --> 14:21.513
Where did you come from?

14:23.516 --> 14:26.184
Why then, you must know Dorothy.

14:29.772 --> 14:31.356
Well, I'll be.

14:31.524 --> 14:33.400
I'm Tuffy, the Munchkin Mouse.

14:33.568 --> 14:36.528
And I'd like to welcome you to Munchkin Land.

14:38.698 --> 14:41.700
I'm afraid Dorothy's left hours ago.

14:47.290 --> 14:49.124
The house you and Dorothy came in...

14:49.292 --> 14:52.377
...landed on the Wicked Witch
of The East and crushed her.

14:52.545 --> 14:54.588
Dorothy had freed us from the Witch...

14:54.756 --> 14:57.299
...and then Glinda, the Good Witch of the North...

14:57.467 --> 14:59.384
...gave Dorothy the ruby slippers.

14:59.552 --> 15:02.220
But then, the Wicked Witch
of the West showed up...

15:02.388 --> 15:04.681
...to take the magical ruby slippers.

15:04.849 --> 15:06.892
And she'll do anything to get them.

15:10.730 --> 15:12.189
So Glinda sent Dorothy...

15:12.357 --> 15:15.734
...to the great and powerful
Wizard of Oz in the Emerald City...

15:15.902 --> 15:19.029
...where she's gonna ask the Wizard
to send her home to Kansas.

15:19.197 --> 15:21.239
So she set off on the yellow brick road.

15:21.741 --> 15:32.918
Follow the yellow brick road.

15:36.130 --> 15:37.339
Stop.

15:37.507 --> 15:39.299
You can't follow Dorothy.

15:39.467 --> 15:41.510
It's too dangerous.

15:58.111 --> 16:02.364
So you two promised you'd protect Dorothy, huh?

16:03.533 --> 16:05.951
Then take me with you. I know I can help.

16:06.119 --> 16:07.786
What do you say?

16:11.290 --> 16:14.960
Don't laugh. I'm very insecure about my size.

16:15.128 --> 16:17.212
Oh, it's sad believe me, mister

16:17.380 --> 16:19.297
When you're tiny as a blister

16:19.465 --> 16:22.092
Without the strength to fight

16:22.844 --> 16:24.511
But I could show my prowess

16:24.679 --> 16:29.724
Though I'm just a humble mouse
If I only had the height

16:30.268 --> 16:34.146
I'm afraid there's no denying
I'm small, but I'm not crying

16:34.313 --> 16:36.815
I'm gonna be all right.

16:37.692 --> 16:41.486
I'd be tall as a giant I'd be big and self-reliant

16:41.654 --> 16:44.656
If I only had the height

16:46.826 --> 16:51.079
We're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

16:51.247 --> 16:52.873
We hear he is a wiz of a wiz

16:53.040 --> 16:54.749
If ever a wiz there was

16:54.917 --> 16:56.460
If ever, oh, ever a wiz there was

16:56.627 --> 16:58.420
The Wizard of Oz is one because

16:58.588 --> 17:01.756
Because, because, because Because

17:01.924 --> 17:04.300
Because of the wonderful things He does

17:05.261 --> 17:07.179
We're off to see the Wizard

17:07.346 --> 17:11.766
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

17:24.655 --> 17:26.198
If ever a wiz there was

17:26.365 --> 17:27.949
If ever, oh, ever a wiz there was

17:28.117 --> 17:30.118
The Wizard of Oz is one because

17:30.286 --> 17:34.581
Because, because, because Because

17:36.209 --> 17:37.959
Because of the wonderful things he does

17:49.347 --> 17:53.391
Uh-oh. Now which way do we go?

17:53.935 --> 17:55.560
Ho, ho, ho. Look at those.

17:55.728 --> 17:57.479
That's a strange threesome right there.

17:57.647 --> 17:58.939
Oh, look at them. Yeah, odd.

17:59.106 --> 18:00.565
Yeah, go ahead and do something.

18:00.733 --> 18:02.734
You say something and I'll say something.

18:02.902 --> 18:07.405
Pardon me, but that way is very nice.

18:08.866 --> 18:10.742
What are you, nuts? No one goes that way.

18:10.910 --> 18:14.037
What do you mean? Lots of people go both ways.

18:22.380 --> 18:23.922
How do you do, Mr. Crows?

18:24.090 --> 18:27.259
I'm Tuffy and these are my friends, Tom and Jerry.

18:27.426 --> 18:33.014
Did you see a young girl
skip by with a basket and a dog?

18:33.182 --> 18:34.391
Sure did.

18:34.559 --> 18:36.518
- She passed by just a few hours ago.
- Yeah.

18:36.686 --> 18:40.605
She hooked up with the scarecrow and
they went dancing off down that road there.

18:41.315 --> 18:43.567
Thanks, fellers.

18:43.734 --> 18:47.112
We'll catch up to Dorothy in no time now.

18:48.030 --> 18:51.449
Unless she went skipping down that road.

18:51.617 --> 18:52.951
You know, I think she did.

18:53.119 --> 18:55.912
Oh, well. At least we helped.

18:59.208 --> 19:01.459
- See you.
- Oh, we sure fooled them.

19:02.962 --> 19:04.713
It's funny. We had to do it.

19:49.925 --> 19:50.967
Hmph!

19:53.638 --> 19:55.972
I don't know, fellers, this doesn't look right.

19:58.976 --> 20:01.186
What do you think we should do?

20:01.604 --> 20:03.855
Follow the yellow brick road?

20:05.483 --> 20:13.365
Follow the yellow brick road.

20:50.903 --> 20:53.822
Wicked Witch. Hide.

20:59.912 --> 21:01.746
There's that cursed girl.

21:02.957 --> 21:05.333
When I have her ruby slippers...

21:05.501 --> 21:08.253
...my power will be the greatest in all of Oz.

21:08.921 --> 21:10.422
But how to do it?

21:10.589 --> 21:14.342
Oh, oh, oh. You could ask her nicely.

21:14.510 --> 21:15.552
Hey.

21:15.720 --> 21:18.513
You could trade her for a bag of magic beans.

21:18.681 --> 21:22.183
Ahh! Sorry. Wrong story.

21:23.102 --> 21:24.436
Now, quiet, both of you.

21:24.603 --> 21:27.522
I'm trying to think.

21:31.861 --> 21:34.446
I said quiet.

21:34.739 --> 21:38.116
Ah! That's how I'll get that girl.

21:38.284 --> 21:42.203
I'll turn these pretty dandelions into an avalanche.

21:49.128 --> 21:50.587
We gotta get that wand.

21:50.755 --> 21:53.673
It's the only way to save Dorothy.

21:57.136 --> 22:00.597
Hey! What? Whoa!

22:04.143 --> 22:05.560
- Got it.
- What?

22:05.728 --> 22:07.437
Get that wand.

22:17.907 --> 22:19.741
Jerry, catch.

22:20.701 --> 22:22.243
Give me that wand, little mouse.

22:22.411 --> 22:24.412
It's mine.

22:26.373 --> 22:27.499
Ha, ha!

22:34.715 --> 22:37.175
Enough of this foolishness.

22:37.343 --> 22:40.136
Come on, you two, quit clowning around.

22:40.304 --> 22:43.807
I'll deal with you
right after I finish that girl. Ha-ha-ha!

22:53.776 --> 22:56.528
Ha, ha-- What? Again?

22:59.532 --> 23:01.324
What's that? What's that?

23:01.492 --> 23:03.785
- Oh, no.
- It's an avalanche.

23:13.170 --> 23:15.880
- We're saved.
- Unusual weather we're having.

23:22.471 --> 23:23.721
Tom, Jerry, look out.

23:24.139 --> 23:26.391
Tom and Jerry, eh?

23:26.559 --> 23:29.143
Well, you've both earned my wrath.

23:30.396 --> 23:33.147
Ahh! This isn't over.

23:33.315 --> 23:38.820
I'll get you Tom and Jerry, and that little girl, too.

23:46.078 --> 23:47.078
Good work, guys.

23:47.246 --> 23:50.498
Now, come on, let's catch up to Dorothy.

23:55.337 --> 23:57.881
Someone always helps that girl.

23:58.048 --> 24:01.259
But I'm still great enough to conquer her.

24:02.761 --> 24:05.680
To the Emerald City, as fast as lighting.

24:14.857 --> 24:18.234
Oh, Tom, Jerry.

24:19.612 --> 24:22.447
How did you two get here?

24:22.615 --> 24:24.365
The twister brought them here with you.

24:24.533 --> 24:25.992
Name's Tuffy, Miss Dorothy.

24:26.160 --> 24:28.244
And I came along because I want the Wizard...

24:28.412 --> 24:31.205
...to give me some height,
on account of I'm so small.

24:31.373 --> 24:32.707
Oh, I see.

24:32.875 --> 24:35.251
Well, my new friends want to see the Wizard, too.

24:35.794 --> 24:38.713
That's right. I'm hoping the Wizard
will give me some brains.

24:38.881 --> 24:41.466
- I want a heart.
- And I need some courage.

24:41.634 --> 24:46.304
And all Tom, Jerry, Toto and I want
is to get back home to Kansas.

24:47.681 --> 24:49.307
Then what are we waiting for?

24:49.475 --> 24:51.809
Let's get to the Emerald City.

24:51.977 --> 24:54.270
I'm afraid there's no denying

24:54.438 --> 24:56.272
I'm small but I'm not crying

24:56.440 --> 24:59.067
It's gonna be all right

24:59.860 --> 25:02.153
I'd be tall as a giant

25:02.321 --> 25:03.988
I'd be big and self-reliant

25:04.156 --> 25:06.324
I'd be smart and rather pliant

25:06.492 --> 25:11.454
If the Wizard's not defiant And will serve

25:11.622 --> 25:13.581
Then I'm sure to get a brain

25:13.749 --> 25:15.750
- A heart
- A home

25:15.918 --> 25:17.418
Some height

25:17.586 --> 25:21.965
We're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

25:22.132 --> 25:25.468
We hear he is a wiz of a wiz
If ever a wiz there was

25:25.636 --> 25:30.014
We're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

25:43.487 --> 25:46.197
Look, Emerald City is closer and prettier than ever.

25:46.365 --> 25:48.449
- Oh, my.
- Simply amazing.

25:48.617 --> 25:50.034
We're nearly there.

25:50.703 --> 25:52.453
Come on.

25:53.706 --> 25:57.500
- I'm feeling smarter already.
- Come on, let's go.

26:07.803 --> 26:09.554
Cabby. Cabby.

26:09.722 --> 26:11.180
Just what you're looking for.

26:11.348 --> 26:13.725
Take you anyplace in the city, we does.

26:13.892 --> 26:16.894
- Will you take us to see the Wizard?
- The Wizard?

26:17.062 --> 26:18.730
I can't.

26:18.897 --> 26:22.066
Well, yes, but first I'll have
to take you to a little place...

26:22.234 --> 26:24.527
...where you can tidy up a bit, what?

26:24.695 --> 26:26.571
Oh, thank you so much.

26:26.739 --> 26:28.573
We've been gone such a long time.

26:28.741 --> 26:30.241
And we feel so miser--

26:31.326 --> 26:33.453
What kind of a horse is that?

26:33.620 --> 26:35.872
I've never seen a horse like that before.

26:36.040 --> 26:38.332
No, and never will again, I fancy.

26:38.500 --> 26:40.835
There's only one of him, and he's it.

26:41.003 --> 26:45.298
He's the horse of a different color
you've heard tale about.

26:46.133 --> 26:49.927
Ha ha ha, ho ho ho And a couple of tra-la-las

26:50.095 --> 26:54.348
That's how we laugh the day away
In the merry old land of Oz

26:54.516 --> 26:58.394
Buzz buzz buzz, chirp chirp chirp
And a couple of la-di-das

26:58.562 --> 27:00.438
That's how the crickets crick All day

27:00.606 --> 27:02.231
In the merry old land of Oz

27:02.399 --> 27:06.444
We get up at 12 And start to work at 1

27:06.612 --> 27:09.822
Take an hour for lunch And then at 2 we're done

27:09.990 --> 27:11.032
Jolly good fun

27:11.200 --> 27:14.786
Ha ha ha, ho ho ho And a couple of tra-la-las

27:14.953 --> 27:19.082
That's how we laugh the day away
In the merry old land of Oz

27:19.249 --> 27:23.044
Ha ha ha, ho ho ho Ha ha ha ha ha

27:23.212 --> 27:27.298
That's how we laugh the day away
With a ha ha ha and a ho ho ho

27:27.466 --> 27:29.342
In the merry old land of Oz

27:29.510 --> 27:32.136
Come on along, folks.

28:31.280 --> 28:34.699
Look. "Surrender Dorothy."

28:35.367 --> 28:38.327
Well, at least she's forgotten about you two.

28:39.037 --> 28:43.708
Oops, my mistake. She's still pretty mad at you.

28:47.004 --> 28:48.713
Dorothy? Who's Dorothy?

28:48.881 --> 28:52.175
- And who's Tom and Jerry?
- The Wizard will explain it. To the Wizard.

28:52.342 --> 28:54.719
Dorothy, we'd better see the Wizard right away.

28:54.887 --> 28:56.846
Oh, I think you're right.

28:57.014 --> 28:59.390
Jerry, please find Tom and follow us.

29:55.280 --> 29:58.616
You can't run away, Tom.
You promised you'd protect Dorothy.

30:05.040 --> 30:08.459
I am Oz, the great and powerful.

30:08.627 --> 30:10.461
Who are you?

30:12.381 --> 30:15.549
Halt. No one can see the great Oz.

30:15.717 --> 30:17.051
But we're with Dorothy.

30:17.219 --> 30:20.471
The-- The Witch's Dorothy?

30:20.639 --> 30:23.224
She's already inside with the Wizard.

30:26.561 --> 30:27.603
Don't worry, now.

30:27.771 --> 30:30.606
I know it sounds bad, but I assure you...

30:30.774 --> 30:35.319
...the great Oz is wise and benevolent and kind.

30:38.323 --> 30:41.742
Of course, sometimes
he does get a little ticked off.

30:42.661 --> 30:45.663
What happened inside, Miss Dorothy?
Are you going home?

30:45.831 --> 30:49.000
Will Scarecrow get his brain? Will I get to be big?

30:49.167 --> 30:53.170
Oh, Tuffy, the Wizard says
he won't do anything for any of us.

30:53.338 --> 30:56.757
Not unless Dorothy brings him
the Wicked Witch's broomstick.

30:56.925 --> 30:59.760
But to do that, she'd have to kill the Witch.

31:01.513 --> 31:04.307
Oh, this is terrible, terrible.

31:06.310 --> 31:07.476
That's right, Tom.

31:07.644 --> 31:10.354
You give that Wizard a piece of your mind.

31:10.522 --> 31:13.024
Oh. Tom's a lot braver than I thought.

31:17.529 --> 31:20.865
Okay, let's go get that witch.

31:33.920 --> 31:38.674
"Witches castle, one mile.
I'd turn back if I were you."

31:48.685 --> 31:52.271
At last, I've got that girl right where I want her.

31:52.439 --> 31:54.857
And Tom and Jerry, too.

31:55.025 --> 31:57.026
Take your army to the haunted forest...

31:57.194 --> 32:01.655
...and bring me that girl, her dog,
and especially that cat and mouse.

32:01.823 --> 32:04.033
Now, fly. Fly.

32:29.434 --> 32:31.102
Well, what's happened to you?

32:31.269 --> 32:33.562
They took my legs off and threw them over there.

32:33.730 --> 32:35.981
They took my chest out and threw it there.

32:36.149 --> 32:37.525
Well, that's you all over.

32:37.692 --> 32:40.736
They sure knocked the stuffings
out of you, didn't they?

32:40.904 --> 32:43.280
They took Dorothy and Toto and Tom and Jerry...

32:43.448 --> 32:45.783
...and we gotta follow them.

33:52.934 --> 33:55.436
- What a nice little dog.
- No!

33:55.604 --> 33:56.687
Oh, Toto.

33:56.855 --> 34:00.524
And you, my dear, what an unexpected pleasure.

34:00.692 --> 34:04.695
It's so kind of you to visit me in my loneliness.

34:06.448 --> 34:10.826
Now, give me those ruby slippers
or your dog goes into the river.

34:11.369 --> 34:14.038
No, please. Take the slippers.

34:14.206 --> 34:18.542
What a good little girl.
I knew you'd listen to reason.

34:21.545 --> 34:23.047
I should have remembered.

34:23.215 --> 34:26.884
Those slippers will never come off
as long as you're alive.

34:29.221 --> 34:32.556
But that's not what's worrying me,
it's how to do it.

34:32.724 --> 34:35.141
These things must be done delicately...

34:35.310 --> 34:38.521
...or you'll hurt the spell.

34:44.735 --> 34:47.905
- Run, Toto, run.
- Catch him, you fool.

34:50.992 --> 34:52.243
Do you see that?

34:52.409 --> 34:54.828
It's how long you've got to live.

34:54.996 --> 34:57.665
And it isn't long, my dear.

34:59.626 --> 35:01.418
Wanna play ball, Jerry?

35:21.481 --> 35:22.773
Tom, Jerry.

35:22.941 --> 35:24.358
That's the last of them.

35:24.526 --> 35:28.279
I'll come back for you
just as soon as those sands run out.

35:34.452 --> 35:38.080
Yo he ho Yo ho

35:38.248 --> 35:39.957
And halt.

35:40.125 --> 35:41.792
Excellent work, new guard.

35:41.960 --> 35:44.336
- Any questions so far?
- Yeah.

35:44.504 --> 35:47.131
What does that "Yo He Ho" song mean?

35:47.591 --> 35:50.092
I have absolutely no idea.

35:50.260 --> 35:52.928
Let's review what we learned today.

35:53.972 --> 35:57.933
"Rule one: Winkie guards
must keep track of their hours...

35:59.561 --> 36:02.896
...and submit a timecard at the end of the week."

36:03.064 --> 36:05.232
Something wrong, new guard?

36:06.484 --> 36:07.526
Okay, then.

36:07.694 --> 36:11.822
"Rule two: Winkie guards
receive one personal day...

36:11.990 --> 36:14.325
...every 300 years.

36:14.492 --> 36:19.496
Rule three, and this
is the most important rule of all...

36:19.664 --> 36:24.376
..."Guards must keep all water
away from the Wicked Witch.

36:24.544 --> 36:27.588
It's her one weakness."

36:29.341 --> 36:31.008
Got that?

36:33.595 --> 36:38.474
Sir, I think we have a couple of escaped prisoners.

36:38.642 --> 36:40.976
Well, how about that?

36:41.144 --> 36:44.104
You're having a busy first day, new guard.

36:44.272 --> 36:45.314
I salute you.

36:48.401 --> 36:49.526
It's them.

36:49.694 --> 36:51.945
Oh, dear. Seize them.

36:55.617 --> 36:59.703
I'm afraid this won't look good
on your personal evaluation.

37:14.219 --> 37:16.220
You know, I'm just a guard...

37:16.388 --> 37:21.725
...but I take my responsibilities very seriously.

37:38.326 --> 37:40.411
It's not a glamorous job...

37:40.578 --> 37:45.332
...but a good guard
always does the very best he can.

37:57.470 --> 37:59.430
If you come along quietly...

37:59.597 --> 38:03.642
...I'll try to get you an extra ration of gruel.

38:05.687 --> 38:08.772
- Gotcha.
- Arrest them, old new guard.

38:08.940 --> 38:11.150
You better not try any of your tricks.

38:11.317 --> 38:14.445
They won't work twice.

38:17.615 --> 38:20.951
Are you sure you completed basic training?

38:31.254 --> 38:35.632
- Tom, Jerry, it's us.
- Boy, are we glad to see you.

38:37.302 --> 38:39.052
Toto found us and led us back here.

38:40.430 --> 38:42.014
Where's Dorothy?

38:43.224 --> 38:45.934
"Witch." "Slippers." "Ouch."

38:47.270 --> 38:51.148
She's locked in the tower
with only moments left to live.

38:55.153 --> 38:57.154
Auntie Em.

38:59.073 --> 39:01.116
Dorothy, where are you?

39:01.284 --> 39:04.495
It's Aunt Em, we're looking for you.

39:04.662 --> 39:06.705
Oh, Auntie Em, don't go away.

39:06.873 --> 39:08.832
I'm frightened. Come back.

39:09.000 --> 39:12.252
- Come back.
- I'll give you Auntie Em, my pretty.

39:22.222 --> 39:25.140
Toto will find Dorothy. Come on.

39:30.605 --> 39:32.815
There's more?

39:45.537 --> 39:49.832
You mean that water is the Witch's one weakness?

39:51.668 --> 39:52.709
I'll take that.

39:57.966 --> 39:59.508
You and Tom find some more water.

39:59.676 --> 40:03.136
I'll go with the others and try
to save Dorothy. Good luck, fellers.

41:14.751 --> 41:16.543
This way.

41:19.380 --> 41:21.590
Wait, I have an idea.

41:21.758 --> 41:23.133
Dorothy, are you in there?

41:24.344 --> 41:25.385
I'm here.

41:25.553 --> 41:26.678
Oh, please hurry.

41:26.846 --> 41:29.556
The Witch will be back
when the hourglass is empty.

41:30.475 --> 41:32.851
I'll handle this.

41:33.061 --> 41:34.311
Stand back.

41:35.688 --> 41:37.022
We haven't much time.

41:37.190 --> 41:38.815
Hi.

41:55.875 --> 41:58.502
Oh, Dorothy, we found you.

41:58.670 --> 42:00.462
Oh, thank you. Oh.

42:00.672 --> 42:02.506
Come on, there's no time to lose.

42:13.518 --> 42:15.602
Oh, run.

42:22.610 --> 42:24.486
We're trapped, don't you know?

42:27.782 --> 42:29.282
I'll handle this.

42:35.123 --> 42:37.708
Who dares disturb my cookie time?

42:42.964 --> 42:44.006
That's right.

42:44.173 --> 42:47.801
That's what you get
when you mess with a big munchkin.

42:47.969 --> 42:50.637
Very impressive. Now run.

42:59.480 --> 43:02.733
What are you guys doing?
We need that water, fast.

43:03.568 --> 43:05.444
Come on.

43:09.490 --> 43:10.782
Whoa!

43:51.824 --> 43:53.408
We're safe.

43:55.411 --> 43:57.037
Going so soon?

43:57.205 --> 43:59.873
Why, our little party's just beginning.

44:00.041 --> 44:02.751
We're trapped. Trapped like mice, rats.

44:09.467 --> 44:10.801
That's right.

44:10.968 --> 44:15.597
Don't hurt them right away,
let them think about it a little first.

44:16.474 --> 44:17.724
Ha!

44:21.395 --> 44:22.479
Seize them.

44:23.773 --> 44:25.148
Seize them. Seize them.

44:25.316 --> 44:27.150
Stop them, you fools. Seize them.

44:27.318 --> 44:29.402
Seize them.

44:35.868 --> 44:37.661
Guys.

44:39.747 --> 44:41.706
What?

44:43.334 --> 44:45.168
Stop fooling around.

44:45.336 --> 44:47.629
Dorothy needs that water.

44:47.797 --> 44:49.840
Hmm. Ah-ha!

45:10.695 --> 45:13.029
There. Water.

45:17.994 --> 45:21.037
This way. Come on.

45:26.586 --> 45:28.170
Oh, my.

45:30.882 --> 45:32.299
That way.

45:51.068 --> 45:52.444
Hyah!

45:54.447 --> 45:55.822
Whoa!

46:16.636 --> 46:18.053
Well, well.

46:18.221 --> 46:21.932
Ring around the rosie, a pocket full of spears.

46:22.099 --> 46:24.017
Thought you were pretty foxy, didn't you?

46:27.605 --> 46:30.607
Ha-ha-ha! Fill it up.

46:31.067 --> 46:33.902
The last to go will see the first four go before her.

46:34.070 --> 46:35.111
No.

46:43.079 --> 46:45.789
How about a little fire, Scarecrow?

46:45.957 --> 46:47.791
Oh, no.

46:47.959 --> 46:49.376
I'm burning. I'm burning.

47:12.525 --> 47:14.985
Jerry, quick, the water.

47:18.906 --> 47:20.407
I'm burning. Help me.

47:20.574 --> 47:22.158
I'm burning. Help.

47:22.326 --> 47:23.994
Don't throw that water.

47:26.497 --> 47:30.166
You cursed brat, look what you've done.

47:30.334 --> 47:32.794
I'm melting, melting.

47:33.337 --> 47:34.838
What a world.

47:35.006 --> 47:37.799
Who could have thought
a good little girl like you...

47:37.967 --> 47:41.011
...would destroy my beautiful wickedness?

47:41.178 --> 47:45.598
Look out. I'm going.

47:52.690 --> 47:56.693
She's dead. You killed her.

47:57.028 --> 47:58.695
I didn't meant to kill her.

47:58.863 --> 48:02.115
Really, I didn't. It's just that he was on fire.

48:02.283 --> 48:04.909
Hail to Dorothy, the Wicked Witch is dead.

48:05.077 --> 48:08.997
Hail, hail to Dorothy, the Wicked Witch is dead.

48:09.832 --> 48:11.207
The broomstick.

48:13.878 --> 48:16.004
- May we have it?
- Of course you can.

48:16.172 --> 48:18.506
You've freed us all from the Wicked Witch.

48:22.219 --> 48:26.473
Now I can go back to my old job as a haberdasher.

48:26.640 --> 48:28.725
Hail to Dorothy.

48:28.893 --> 48:30.560
Hail, hail to Dorothy.

48:30.728 --> 48:33.396
The Wicked Witch is dead.

48:33.939 --> 48:36.232
Why have you come back?

48:37.651 --> 48:38.693
Please, sir.

48:38.861 --> 48:40.320
We've done what you told us.

48:40.488 --> 48:43.531
We've brought you the broomstick
of the Wicked Witch of the West.

48:43.699 --> 48:45.283
Dorothy melted her.

48:45.451 --> 48:47.452
- You liquidated her, eh?
- Shh!

48:47.620 --> 48:50.872
So you see, sir, we'd like you
to fulfill your promises to us.

48:51.040 --> 48:54.167
Not so fast. Not so fast.

48:54.335 --> 48:57.379
I'll have to give the matter a little thought.

48:57.546 --> 48:59.589
Go away and come back tomorrow.

48:59.757 --> 49:00.799
What?

49:00.966 --> 49:03.551
But I want to go home now.

49:04.095 --> 49:08.264
Do not arouse the wrath
of the great and powerful Oz.

49:08.432 --> 49:11.643
I said come back tomorrow.

49:11.811 --> 49:13.895
If you were really great and powerful...

49:14.063 --> 49:15.522
...you'd keep your promises.

49:15.689 --> 49:19.317
Do you presume to criticize the great Oz?

49:19.485 --> 49:22.862
You ungrateful creatures.

49:26.117 --> 49:28.034
The great Oz has spoken.

49:29.703 --> 49:33.415
What? Hey. No. Stop th--Stop that. Whoa!

49:34.792 --> 49:35.834
Oh, I--

49:36.001 --> 49:38.837
Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain.

49:39.004 --> 49:41.589
The great Oz has spoken.

49:41.757 --> 49:43.550
- Who are you?
- I?

49:43.717 --> 49:45.844
Oh, I am the great and powerful...

49:47.888 --> 49:49.347
...Wizard of Oz.

49:49.598 --> 49:51.641
- You humbug.
- Yeah.

49:51.809 --> 49:53.685
I'm afraid you're right.

49:53.853 --> 49:55.645
I am a humbug.

49:55.813 --> 49:58.273
What about the heart that you promised Tin Man?

49:58.441 --> 50:00.442
And the courage you promised Cowardly Lion?

50:00.609 --> 50:02.777
Don't forget the most important thing.

50:02.945 --> 50:05.989
He promised he'd get Dorothy
back home to Kansas.

50:06.449 --> 50:07.574
Yeah.

50:07.741 --> 50:12.162
My diminutive friend, you force me
into a cataclysmic decision.

50:12.329 --> 50:15.123
The only way to get Dorothy
back home to Kansas...

50:15.291 --> 50:17.500
...is for me to take her there myself.

50:17.668 --> 50:19.669
Oh, will you? Could you?

50:19.837 --> 50:21.171
I will, indeed.

50:21.338 --> 50:24.841
But first, I'll fulfill my promises to each of you.

50:25.009 --> 50:28.136
Tuffy, too? He was going to ask you
to make him big.

50:28.304 --> 50:30.597
Yes, Tuffy, too.

50:39.315 --> 50:41.733
My friends, I, your wizard...

50:41.901 --> 50:44.444
...am about to embark upon a hazardous journey...

50:44.612 --> 50:46.779
...into the outer stratosphere.

50:49.867 --> 50:52.619
And I hereby decree that in my absence...

50:52.786 --> 50:57.457
...the Scarecrow shall rule by
virtue of his highly superior brain.

50:58.125 --> 51:01.044
The sum of the square roots of any two
sides of an isosceles triangle...

51:01.212 --> 51:03.421
...is equal to the square root of the remaining side.

51:03.589 --> 51:05.715
Oh, joy. Rapture.

51:05.883 --> 51:09.719
Assisted by the Tin Man by virtue of his heart...

51:09.887 --> 51:12.555
...the Lion, by virtue of his courage.

51:12.723 --> 51:14.807
Ain't it the truth?

51:14.975 --> 51:17.977
And Tuffy, by virtue of his enormous height.

51:18.729 --> 51:20.146
I'm huge.

51:20.314 --> 51:23.358
Obey them as you would me.

51:33.244 --> 51:35.870
Oh! Oh, Toto.

51:36.872 --> 51:39.374
Please don't go, I'll be right back.

51:39.542 --> 51:42.585
Oh, but this is a highly irregular procedure.

51:43.295 --> 51:46.214
This is absolutely unprecedented.

51:46.382 --> 51:49.384
Boys, please. We don't want to keep
the Wizard waiting.

51:49.552 --> 51:52.887
Oh! Oh, my. Come back, come back.

51:53.055 --> 51:54.931
Don't go without me, please come back.

51:55.099 --> 51:56.516
I can't come back.

51:56.684 --> 52:01.271
I don't know how it works. Goodbye, folks.

52:02.106 --> 52:04.440
Goodbye, Wizard, goodbye.

52:04.608 --> 52:08.069
Now I'll never get home to Kansas.

52:10.281 --> 52:11.781
Goodbye, Wizard.

52:11.949 --> 52:14.909
Stay with us. We don't want you to go.

52:17.079 --> 52:19.622
Look, here's someone who can help you.

52:30.259 --> 52:31.926
Oh, will you send me home?

52:32.094 --> 52:33.428
Can you send me home?

52:33.596 --> 52:35.638
You don't need to be helped any longer.

52:35.806 --> 52:38.349
You've always had the power
to go back to Kansas.

52:38.517 --> 52:40.226
I have?

52:40.394 --> 52:43.688
Now those ruby slippers
will take you home in two seconds.

52:43.856 --> 52:46.316
Tom and Jerry and Toto, too?

52:46.483 --> 52:48.568
Tom and Jerry and Toto, too.

52:51.572 --> 52:53.990
Just tap your heels three times...

52:54.158 --> 52:57.493
...and think to yourself,
"There's no place like home."

52:58.078 --> 53:00.705
"There's no place like home."

53:00.873 --> 53:03.833
- There's no place like home.
- There's no place like home.

53:04.001 --> 53:13.593
There's no place like home.

53:14.011 --> 53:18.181
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.

53:39.870 --> 53:42.330
- You just had a bad dream.
- Sure you did.

53:42.498 --> 53:44.040
You remember us, don't you?

53:44.208 --> 53:47.126
And you couldn't forget
your old pal Tuffy, could you?

53:47.294 --> 53:49.671
Or me, the local haberdasher.

53:51.507 --> 53:53.341
Well, she's all right now, thank heaven.

53:53.509 --> 53:55.635
Oh, but I wasn't all right, Aunt Em.

53:55.803 --> 53:57.303
We were in terrible danger.

53:57.471 --> 53:59.722
But we kept asking people to send us home.

53:59.890 --> 54:01.057
And they sent us home.

54:03.060 --> 54:05.728
Doesn't anyone believe me?

54:49.106 --> 54:51.941
Anyway, it's all right, because I'm home again...

54:52.109 --> 54:56.112
...and this is my room and I love you all.

54:56.280 --> 55:00.950
And, oh, Auntie Em, there's no place like home.
