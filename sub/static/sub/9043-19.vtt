WEBVTT

00:00.900 --> 00:02.200
- [giggling]

00:02.200 --> 00:04.033
- NO, NOW HERE'S
THE SWEETEST THING.

00:04.033 --> 00:05.567
EVERY NIGHT
SINCE OUR WEDDING,

00:05.567 --> 00:07.167
ROBERT GIVES ME
A LITTLE MASSAGE.

00:07.167 --> 00:09.067
- OH, WOW.
YOU ARE SO LUCKY.

00:09.067 --> 00:10.633
- YEAH.

00:10.633 --> 00:12.433
ALTHOUGH HE KIND OF
DOESN'T KNOW HIS OWN STRENGTH,

00:12.433 --> 00:14.067
AND SOMETIMES
WHEN HE SQUEEZES,

00:14.067 --> 00:18.400
I FEEL LIKE
I'M BEING JUICED.

00:18.400 --> 00:19.900
BUT IT'S VERY THOUGHTFUL.

00:19.900 --> 00:22.200
- CAN'T YOU JUST TELL HIM
TO LIGHTEN UP A LITTLE?

00:22.200 --> 00:23.633
- I DON'T HAVE THE HEART.

00:23.633 --> 00:25.933
PLUS I USUALLY BLACK OUT
BEFORE I CAN SAY ANYTHING.

00:25.933 --> 00:28.967
[laughter]

00:28.967 --> 00:30.367
- MY BERNIE DOES
CUTE THINGS TOO.

00:30.367 --> 00:32.867
YOU KNOW, LIKE, EVERY NIGHT
HE SHUFFLES IN

00:32.867 --> 00:34.033
IN HIS PAJAMAS.

00:34.033 --> 00:36.600
HE KNEELS BY THE BED
AND PRAYS.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.033
- AW.

00:38.033 --> 00:40.500
- YOU KNOW, WHEN RAY
KNEELS BY THE BED,

00:40.500 --> 00:42.833
IT'S NOT SO MUCH PRAYING
AS BEGGING.

00:42.833 --> 00:46.467
[laughter]

00:46.467 --> 00:51.000
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
RAY IS PRETTY SWEET HIMSELF.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.133
THE OTHER NIGHT,
WHEN I WOKE UP,

00:53.133 --> 00:55.233
HE WAS WHIMPERING
IN HIS SLEEP.

00:55.233 --> 00:56.533
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

00:56.533 --> 00:59.700
AND THEN HE SAID,
"CHOO-CHOO GONE."

00:59.700 --> 01:01.867
both: AWW...

01:01.867 --> 01:05.300
- "CHOO-CHOO GONE."
HOW ADORABLE IS THAT?

01:05.300 --> 01:07.033
- YOU KNOW, HE WOKE UP,
AND HE WAS REALLY EMBARRASSED,

01:07.033 --> 01:09.000
BUT HE TOLD ME
HE WAS HAVING A DREAM

01:09.000 --> 01:10.767
THAT HE WAS IN THE PARK
WITH HIS MOMMY,

01:10.767 --> 01:14.133
AND THE KIDDY TRAIN LEFT
BEFORE HE GOT ON.

01:14.133 --> 01:15.900
- OHH.
- I KNOW.

01:15.900 --> 01:17.167
- I AM SUCH A SUCKER

01:17.167 --> 01:18.667
FOR THAT LITTLE BOY THING
IN MEN.

01:18.667 --> 01:21.600
IT'S SO ENDEARING.
[door opens]

01:21.600 --> 01:25.100
- WHERE'S MARIE?
I LOST MY SHOE.

01:37.167 --> 01:38.500
- COME ON, ROBERT.

01:38.500 --> 01:40.300
YOU DIDN'T PLAY THAT BAD,
ALL RIGHT?

01:40.300 --> 01:44.500
I WAS JUST AWESOME.

01:44.500 --> 01:48.133
- THANKS. YOU ALWAYS KNOW
JUST WHAT TO SAY.

01:48.133 --> 01:49.700
- WHAT ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT?
IT'S NOT LIKE ANYBODY SAW YOU.

01:49.700 --> 01:52.133
YOU WERE IN THE WOODS
THE WHOLE TIME.

01:57.433 --> 01:59.400
- ALL RIGHT, SO YOU JUST
INVITED ME IN TO INSULT ME?

01:59.400 --> 02:01.300
IS THAT IT?
- YES.

02:01.300 --> 02:04.633
AND TO OFFER YOU
A MIXED BERRY JUICE BOX.

02:04.633 --> 02:07.500
- HMM.
I DO LIKE MIXED BERRY.

02:07.500 --> 02:09.667
- HERE, I'LL PUT
THE STRAW IN FOR YOU.

02:09.667 --> 02:13.767
I KNOW YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO GET
IT ANYWHERE NEAR THE HOLE.

02:13.767 --> 02:17.033
- I CAN DO IT MYSELF!

02:18.800 --> 02:21.167
GOOD-BYE!

02:21.167 --> 02:23.567
- WHY ARE YOU BEING
SUCH A BABY?

02:23.567 --> 02:24.833
- BABY?
- YEAH.

02:24.833 --> 02:26.800
- I'M A BABY?

02:26.800 --> 02:30.700
BABY KNOWS THREE WORDS,
"CHOO-CHOO GONE."

02:35.667 --> 02:38.100
- WHAT?

02:38.100 --> 02:40.867
- NOTHING.
[sips noisily]

02:40.867 --> 02:41.967
AHH!

02:41.967 --> 02:45.300
[imitates train whistle]

02:51.067 --> 02:52.667
- HEY.
HOW WAS YOUR GOLF?

02:52.667 --> 02:55.367
- W-W-WHAT'D YOU DO?
YOU TOLD ROBERT MY DREAM?

02:55.367 --> 02:56.433
- WHAT?

02:56.433 --> 02:58.733
- MY TRAIN DREAM.
"CHOO-CHOO GONE."

02:58.733 --> 03:00.833
- NO, I DIDN'T TELL
ROBERT THAT.

03:00.833 --> 03:02.500
OH, AMY.

03:02.500 --> 03:04.567
- YOU TOLD AMY?

03:04.567 --> 03:07.300
- WELL, YOU KNOW, I JUST THOUGHT
IT WAS SWEET, AND SO DID SHE.

03:07.300 --> 03:08.800
AND I DIDN'T THINK
SHE WOULD TELL ROBERT.

03:08.800 --> 03:10.633
- NO, IT'S NOT SWEET.
IT'S PERSONAL.

03:10.633 --> 03:12.167
- I'M SORRY,
I'LL TELL AMY

03:12.167 --> 03:13.867
TO KEEP THOSE KIND OF THINGS
BETWEEN US.

03:13.867 --> 03:15.600
- WHA--
NO! NO!

03:15.600 --> 03:18.000
HOW 'BOUT YOU
JUST KEEP THEM BETWEEN US?

03:18.000 --> 03:21.633
WAIT A MINUTE, WHAT THINGS?
SHE KNOWS OTHER OF MY THINGS?

03:23.200 --> 03:24.500
- RAY, JUST CALM DOWN.

03:24.500 --> 03:26.133
- WHAT ELSE
DOES SHE KNOW? HUH?

03:26.133 --> 03:27.567
DOES SHE KNOW
YOU SAW ME THAT TIME,

03:27.567 --> 03:31.267
SHAVING
WITH YOUR PINK LADY RAZOR?

03:31.267 --> 03:32.667
- I DON'T KNOW.

03:32.667 --> 03:34.033
- COME ON, COME ON, THINK.
DID YOU TELL HER?

03:34.033 --> 03:35.367
- RAY, THIS IS CRAZY.

03:35.367 --> 03:37.100
WHAT, DO YOU
EXPECT ME TO REMEMBER

03:37.100 --> 03:40.500
EVERYTHING I'VE EVER TOLD AMY
ABOUT YOU OVER THE YEARS?

03:40.500 --> 03:43.200
- YEARS?

03:43.200 --> 03:45.500
YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS
TO ME FOR YEARS?

03:45.500 --> 03:48.200
- OKAY, I REALIZE
YOU'RE UPSET,

03:48.200 --> 03:50.000
AND I WILL TRY
TO BE MORE SENSITIVE,

03:50.000 --> 03:52.200
BUT I DO TALK TO AMY
ABOUT MY LIFE.

03:52.200 --> 03:55.367
AND I'M SORRY, BUT YOU HAPPEN
TO BE A BIG PART OF MY LIFE.

03:55.367 --> 03:57.733
- WELL, I'M SORRY
YOU AND THE OTHER HENS

03:57.733 --> 03:59.367
DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING BETTER TO DO

03:59.367 --> 04:01.167
THAN TO--THAN TO CLUCK
AROUND THE HENHOUSE

04:01.167 --> 04:04.467
LIKE A GAGGLE
OF CLUCKETY-CLUCKING HENS!

04:07.467 --> 04:08.967
- WE'RE NOT CLUCKING, RAY.

04:08.967 --> 04:11.933
WE'RE SHARING
OUR FEELINGS.

04:11.933 --> 04:13.433
- OH, MY GOD.

04:13.433 --> 04:17.700
YOU TELL HER
ABOUT OUR SEX!

04:17.700 --> 04:21.067
- LOOK, RAY, LISTEN.
I DON'T...

04:21.067 --> 04:22.467
SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

04:22.467 --> 04:24.333
- DUMP HER!

04:24.333 --> 04:25.767
- WHAT?
- YOU HAVE TO DUMP HER.

04:25.767 --> 04:28.100
SHE KNOWS TOO MUCH,
THANKS TO YOUR GOSSIP.

04:28.100 --> 04:32.433
YES, THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU'RE A GOSSIP.

04:35.167 --> 04:36.533
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

04:36.533 --> 04:38.233
- I'M GOING UPSTAIRS
TO TAKE A SHOWER,

04:38.233 --> 04:40.667
AND I WOULD RATHER
AMY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WASH

04:40.667 --> 04:43.667
OR HOW LONG I WASH IT!

04:48.900 --> 04:50.233
[TV turns on]

04:50.233 --> 04:51.733
[sports announcer
speaks indistinctly]

04:51.733 --> 04:53.767
[door opens]
- HEY.

04:53.767 --> 04:55.133
OH, GAME'S ALREADY ON?

04:55.133 --> 04:58.400
- YEAH, YEAH,
IT JUST STARTED.

04:58.400 --> 05:00.033
- UH, SAY THERE, DAD,

05:00.033 --> 05:03.633
HOW 'BOUT PASSING ME
SOME OF THOSE TASTY CHIPS?

05:03.633 --> 05:06.767
- WHY, CERTAINLY, SON.
HERE YOU GO.

05:09.067 --> 05:14.600
[both crunching loudly]

05:16.600 --> 05:19.667
- HEY, ANIMALS, CAN YOU AT LEAST
EAT WITH YOUR MOUTH SHUT?

05:19.667 --> 05:21.700
- OH, I'M SORRY.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

05:21.700 --> 05:25.500
DON'T YOU LIKE
THE WAY WE CHOO-CHOO?

05:31.800 --> 05:34.900
- CHOO-CHOO.
CHOO-CHOO GONE!

05:34.900 --> 05:36.400
[laughter]

05:36.400 --> 05:38.133
WE GOT HIM TOTALLY WORKED.

05:38.133 --> 05:40.333
- YEAH, HA-HA.
VERY FUNNY.

05:40.333 --> 05:41.733
YEAH, YOU WOULDN'T
BE LAUGHING

05:41.733 --> 05:43.867
IF YOU KNEW WHAT THE DREAM
WAS REALLY ABOUT.

05:43.867 --> 05:45.367
- YEAH, RIGHT.
- TRUST ME.

05:45.367 --> 05:47.467
I DIDN'T TELL DEBRA
THE EXACT TRUTH.

05:47.467 --> 05:50.300
- OH, YEAH?
- WHAT WAS IT?

05:50.300 --> 05:52.367
- OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

05:52.367 --> 05:55.867
REMEMBER ELLEN CHULESKY
FROM HIGH SCHOOL?

05:55.867 --> 05:57.600
- OH, YEAH.

05:57.600 --> 06:00.933
SHE WAS A WOMAN AMONG GIRLS.
- YEAH.

06:00.933 --> 06:02.333
WELL, IN MY CLASS,

06:02.333 --> 06:05.767
WE USED TO CALL HER
CHOO-CHOO CHULESKY.

06:05.767 --> 06:09.000
SO ANYWAY, IN THE DREAM,
IT WAS NO KIDDY TRAIN.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.067
IT WAS JUST ME
AND CHOO-CHOO.

06:13.067 --> 06:18.067
ALL ABOARD!

06:18.067 --> 06:20.667
both: OOH.

06:20.667 --> 06:23.233
- SO THEN WHAT DOES
"CHOO-CHOO GONE" MEAN?

06:23.233 --> 06:25.933
- WELL, SHE HAD HER WAY
WITH ME AND LEFT.

06:25.933 --> 06:28.800
SO "CHOO-CHOO" WAS GONE.

06:28.800 --> 06:31.433
ANYWAY, THEN I HAD TO MAKE UP
THE WHOLE TRAIN THING

06:31.433 --> 06:32.833
'CAUSE THE WIFE WAS THERE.

06:32.833 --> 06:36.867
- AH, THEY'RE ALWAYS THERE.

06:36.867 --> 06:38.967
- I DIDN'T KNOW DEBRA
WAS GOING TO GO BLABBING IT.

06:38.967 --> 06:40.433
I DON'T GET IT.

06:40.433 --> 06:41.700
SHE HAS NOTHING BETTER TO DO

06:41.700 --> 06:44.333
THAN TO TALK
ABOUT MY PERSONAL LIFE?

06:44.333 --> 06:46.700
- RAYMOND, RAYMOND, RAYMOND.

06:46.700 --> 06:49.800
SEE, THAT JUST
SHOWS THE SURPRISING NAIVETE

06:49.800 --> 06:50.867
ON YOUR PART.

06:50.867 --> 06:52.233
FOR, YOU SEE,

06:52.233 --> 06:54.367
IT IS ALWAYS
THE NATURE OF THE FEMALE

06:54.367 --> 06:57.467
TO GATHER
WITH OTHER FEMALES--

06:57.467 --> 07:03.233
- AND SCREECH LIKE A TREE
FULL OF CHINESE MONKEYS.

07:03.233 --> 07:05.433
- YEAH, WELL...

07:05.433 --> 07:07.067
I DON'T DO IT TO HER.

07:07.067 --> 07:08.500
I DON'T GO AROUND
TELLING EVERYBODY

07:08.500 --> 07:10.800
THAT DEBRA BURPS
ALL THE TIME.

07:10.800 --> 07:12.767
- DEBRA BURPS?

07:12.767 --> 07:16.233
- YEAH, SOMETIMES
SHE GETS A NERVOUS STOMACH.

07:16.233 --> 07:19.533
IT ROCKS THE HOUSE.

07:19.533 --> 07:21.867
- REALLY?
LITTLE DEBRA?

07:21.867 --> 07:23.233
- OH, YEAH.

07:23.233 --> 07:26.167
ONE TIME, I SAW HER BURP
A DOOR OPEN.

07:26.167 --> 07:29.367
[laughter]

07:31.733 --> 07:32.900
- HEY. HEY.

07:32.900 --> 07:34.633
YOU KNOW WHAT AMY DOES?

07:34.633 --> 07:35.667
- WHAT?

07:35.667 --> 07:39.100
- OKAY.

07:39.100 --> 07:42.267
SOMETIMES
WHEN SHE LAUGHS...

07:42.267 --> 07:45.667
SHE PEES A LITTLE.

07:50.233 --> 07:51.733
- WHAT DO YOU--?

07:51.733 --> 07:55.100
YOU MEAN,
SHE PEES WHEN SHE LAUGHS?

07:55.100 --> 07:56.467
YEAH, WELL,
A CHUCKLE WON'T DO IT,

07:56.467 --> 07:57.833
BUT IF YOU
REALLY CRACK HER UP,

07:57.833 --> 08:00.500
YOU MIGHT WANT TO PUT
SOME PAPERS DOWN.

08:00.500 --> 08:01.767
[laughter]

08:01.767 --> 08:03.200
- OH, MAN!

08:03.200 --> 08:04.833
OUR WIVES
ARE DISGUSTING.

08:04.833 --> 08:06.033
- YEAH.

08:06.033 --> 08:07.533
- AW, THEY ALL
GOT THEIR SECRETS.

08:07.533 --> 08:08.900
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW A GOOD ONE
ABOUT YOUR MOTHER?

08:08.900 --> 08:11.100
both: NO, NO, NO.

08:11.100 --> 08:12.633
- DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.

08:12.633 --> 08:16.900
- YOU KNOW YOUR MOTHER'S FAMOUS
HOMEMADE MARINARA SAUCE?

08:16.900 --> 08:18.467
ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION...

08:18.467 --> 08:21.067
[whispers]
STORE-BOUGHT.

08:21.067 --> 08:23.600
- NO!
- NO! NO WAY!

08:23.600 --> 08:25.567
UH-UH.
- YES. WHEN SHE'S IN A RUSH,

08:25.567 --> 08:30.167
OUT OF THE JAR,
MY FRIENDS.

08:30.167 --> 08:31.767
- THIS IS HUGE!

08:31.767 --> 08:34.100
- OH, MAN!

08:34.100 --> 08:37.267
SO IT'S HOMEMADE IF YOU LIVE
IN AISLE SIX AT WALDBAUM'S.

08:37.267 --> 08:38.567
- YEAH, THERE YOU GO.

08:38.567 --> 08:41.133
HEY, LOOK,
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE AMY DOES?

08:41.133 --> 08:43.667
- HANG ON, LET ME
TURN THIS THING OFF.

08:43.667 --> 08:44.733
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:44.733 --> 08:48.533
I'M GOING TO MAKE US
A POT OF COFFEE.

08:48.533 --> 08:51.500
- THIS IS GREAT.

09:04.167 --> 09:06.000
- LISTEN, RAY, YOU KNOW,
I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT

09:06.000 --> 09:07.900
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID
YESTERDAY,

09:07.900 --> 09:10.033
AND I REALLY AM SORRY.

09:10.033 --> 09:11.600
I THINK
YOU HAVE A GOOD POINT.

09:11.600 --> 09:14.967
SOME THINGS ARE PRIVATE
AND SHOULD JUST STAY THAT WAY.

09:14.967 --> 09:16.400
- THANK YOU.

09:16.400 --> 09:18.267
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.
- OKAY.

09:18.267 --> 09:21.400
GOOD NIGHT.
- NIGHT.

09:28.600 --> 09:31.733
GUESS WHO PEES
WHEN SHE LAUGHS.

09:33.767 --> 09:38.967
- GOT TO TELL YOU, THAT'S
YOUR WORST COME-ON LINE EVER.

09:38.967 --> 09:40.633
- I'LL GIVE YOU
A CLUE.

09:40.633 --> 09:44.067
FIRST LETTER, "A,"
LAST LETTER, "Y,"

09:44.067 --> 09:46.167
AND DON'T ASK ME
THE MIDDLE LETTER,

09:46.167 --> 09:50.033
BECAUSE I "M" NOT GOING
TO TELL YOU.

09:50.033 --> 09:51.267
- NO.
- IT'S AMY.

09:51.267 --> 09:53.467
- [gasps]
SHE DOES?

09:53.467 --> 09:56.100
- ROBERT SAID THAT IF YOU GET
HER LAUGHING HARD ENOUGH,

09:56.100 --> 09:58.767
80% CHANCE
OF FLASH FLOODING.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.767
- WE HAVE BEEN FRIENDS
FOR YEARS.

10:03.767 --> 10:05.067
WHY DIDN'T I KNOW THAT?

10:05.067 --> 10:09.133
- MAYBE YOU'RE NOT FUNNY.

10:09.133 --> 10:10.933
- SO WAIT A MINUTE.

10:10.933 --> 10:13.133
YOU AND ROBERT
WERE GOSSIPING?

10:13.133 --> 10:14.633
- YEAH,
AND MY FATHER TOO.

10:14.633 --> 10:16.633
YOU WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING
ABOUT MY MOTHER?

10:23.233 --> 10:24.633
LOOK AT YOU.

10:24.633 --> 10:26.767
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
THIS EXCITED IN BED.

10:30.100 --> 10:32.733
- SHUT UP AND TELL ME
ABOUT YOUR MOTHER.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.067
- OKAY.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.733
YOU KNOW HER, UH,
FAMOUS HOMEMADE SAUCE?

10:36.733 --> 10:38.067
- YEAH?

10:38.067 --> 10:39.833
- YOU WANT TO KNOW
THE SECRET INGREDIENT?

10:39.833 --> 10:41.500
- OKAY.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.300
- GASOLINE...

10:43.300 --> 10:46.800
WHICH SHE PUTS IN HER CAR
TO DRIVE TO WALDBAUM'S

10:46.800 --> 10:50.800
TO GO TO AISLE SIX
TO PICK UP A JAR OF RAGU!

10:50.800 --> 10:51.833
- NO WAY!

10:51.833 --> 10:52.900
- YEAH!

10:52.900 --> 10:54.700
- [laughing]

10:54.700 --> 10:56.800
WOW!

10:56.800 --> 10:58.633
- HON, LOOK...

10:58.633 --> 11:01.900
I KNOW IT'S A LITTLE EARLY,
BUT HAPPY ANNIVERSARY.

11:01.900 --> 11:06.700
- [giggles]

11:06.700 --> 11:08.800
OH, SO YOUR MOTHER'S
A CHEATER.

11:08.800 --> 11:10.567
- MM-HMM, YEAH,
SHE SURE IS.

11:10.567 --> 11:12.533
- WAIT A MINUTE.

11:12.533 --> 11:14.900
IF THAT'S WHAT THOSE GUYS
WERE SAYING ABOUT THEIR WIVES,

11:14.900 --> 11:18.367
WHAT DID YOU SAY
ABOUT ME?

11:18.367 --> 11:20.400
- NOTHING, I JUST...

11:20.400 --> 11:23.733
I-I TOLD THEM
THAT WHEN YOU SLEEP,

11:23.733 --> 11:28.200
SOMETIMES YOU WIGGLE YOUR NOSE
LIKE A LITTLE BUNNY.

11:28.200 --> 11:30.667
- I DO THAT?
- YEAH, YEAH.

11:30.667 --> 11:32.300
MM-MM-MM-MM-MM.

11:32.300 --> 11:33.800
YEAH, IT'S CUTER ON YOU
THOUGH.

11:33.800 --> 11:36.200
- OH...I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU TOLD THEM THAT.

11:36.200 --> 11:37.933
- YEAH.
- WHAT DID THEY SAY?

11:37.933 --> 11:41.300
- THEY...I THINK
THEY SAID, "AWW."

11:41.300 --> 11:43.933
- AWW!
- [laughs]

11:43.933 --> 11:46.000
- YEAH.
IT WAS CUTE.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.133
- OOH!

11:50.133 --> 11:51.600
- YOU SURE?

11:51.600 --> 11:53.867
- I'M TELLING YOU,
FOR APPLE PIE, 21 SECONDS.

11:53.867 --> 11:54.967
YOU'LL BE VERY HAPPY.

11:54.967 --> 11:56.667
[beeps]

11:56.667 --> 12:01.133
[microwave humming]

12:18.333 --> 12:20.633
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

12:20.633 --> 12:23.433
- JUST...HEATING UP PIE.

12:23.433 --> 12:25.200
[beeps]

12:25.200 --> 12:28.467
- I'LL HAVE SOME,
BUT WASH YOUR HANDS FIRST.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.300
- WHAT'S UP WITH YOU?

12:33.300 --> 12:35.400
- YOU GUYS GOT TO GET
YOUR WIVES OUT OF MY HOUSE.

12:35.400 --> 12:38.300
THEY'RE OVER THERE LOOKING
AT FURNITURE CATALOGS.

12:38.300 --> 12:39.700
I TOLD MARIE,
"AT YOUR AGE,

12:39.700 --> 12:41.100
"YOU SHOULDN'T BE LOOKING
AT ANY FURNITURE

12:41.100 --> 12:44.367
UNLESS IT HAS A LID."

12:51.933 --> 12:54.533
- CHOO-CHOO CHULESKY?

12:54.533 --> 12:56.400
- WHAT?

12:56.400 --> 12:59.433
- WHO IS
CHOO-CHOO CHULESKY?

12:59.433 --> 13:03.500
- RAY, YOU BETTER GET BACK
INTO YOUR MICROWAVE POSITION.

13:07.567 --> 13:10.600
- LOOK, DEBRA...
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

13:10.600 --> 13:12.233
- OH, I THINK YOU WERE DREAMING
ABOUT ANOTHER WOMAN,

13:12.233 --> 13:14.467
AND YOU TOLD ME
A CHOO-CHOO TRAIN STORY.

13:14.467 --> 13:15.867
- NO...

13:15.867 --> 13:18.933
YOU COULDN'T KEEP YOUR
GIANT MOUTH SHUT, COULD YOU?

13:18.933 --> 13:21.533
- I-I-I--

13:21.533 --> 13:23.433
- I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING,
ROBERT, I SWEAR.

13:23.433 --> 13:26.400
- WELL, SOMEONE OPENED
THEIR GIANT MOUTH.

13:26.400 --> 13:29.533
- I DID.

13:29.533 --> 13:32.700
- WELL, I'M SURE YOU HAD
YOUR REASONS.

13:35.833 --> 13:37.300
- MOM?

13:37.300 --> 13:40.667
- YOUR FATHER TOLD ME
ABOUT YOUR LITTLE FANTASY,

13:40.667 --> 13:43.533
AND I FELT I'D BE REMISS
IF I DIDN'T TELL DEBRA

13:43.533 --> 13:47.000
THAT HER MARRIAGE
WAS IN PERIL.

13:48.167 --> 13:49.800
- DAD, WHY WOULD YOU
TELL MOM?

13:49.800 --> 13:51.967
- I WAS PROUD OF YOU.

13:51.967 --> 13:54.533
YOU DREAM LIKE A MAN.

13:54.533 --> 13:56.000
- YEAH, WELL,
THAT'S GREAT, RAY.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.133
I'M GOING AROUND
TELLING EVERYBODY

13:57.133 --> 13:58.567
WHAT A SWEET LITTLE BOY
YOU ARE,

13:58.567 --> 14:00.000
AND YOU'RE DREAMING
ABOUT ANOTHER WOMAN.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.400
THANKS A LOT, RAY.

14:01.400 --> 14:02.767
THANKS FOR MAKING ME LOOK
LIKE A TOTAL JERK!

14:02.767 --> 14:06.500
- WAIT, I MADE IT UP,
I MADE IT UP!

14:06.500 --> 14:10.167
CHOO-CHOO
REALLY WAS A TRAIN.

14:10.167 --> 14:13.167
- SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
YOU LIED TO THEM?

14:13.167 --> 14:17.333
- AND HERE I WAS
FINALLY PROUD OF YOU.

14:17.333 --> 14:19.167
- YOU ARE UNBELIEVABLE,
RAY.

14:19.167 --> 14:21.233
- NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE.

14:21.233 --> 14:22.633
YOU TOOK SOMETHING
THAT WAS PRIVATE,

14:22.633 --> 14:24.533
AND YOU BLABBED IT
ALL OVER TOWN!

14:24.533 --> 14:26.167
- OH, YEAH?
WELL, YOU WERE

14:26.167 --> 14:27.600
A PRETTY GOOD BLABBERMOUTH
YOURSELF LAST NIGHT.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.267
"HEY, GUESS WHO PEES
WHEN SHE LAUGHS."

14:38.667 --> 14:41.033
- GUESS WHO WAS RIGHT THERE
WITH ME, LAUGHING IT UP.

14:41.033 --> 14:43.800
"OH! AMY PEES!
HA-HA, THAT'S SO FUNNY!"

14:43.800 --> 14:47.100
YEAH.

14:49.633 --> 14:52.567
- ROBERT.

14:55.600 --> 14:58.100
- I LOVE YOU.

14:58.100 --> 14:59.433
AMY. AMY.

14:59.433 --> 15:00.600
AMY, LISTEN,
I'M SORRY.

15:00.600 --> 15:04.333
SWEETIE, COME ON,
LOOK AT ME.

15:04.333 --> 15:07.533
WE WERE ALL TALKING.
EVERYONE WAS DOING IT!

15:10.267 --> 15:11.933
DEBRA BELCHES
LIKE A TRUCK DRIVER,

15:11.933 --> 15:14.367
AND MA USES RAGU!

15:14.367 --> 15:17.000
- FRANK!

15:17.000 --> 15:18.533
- RAY!

15:18.533 --> 15:20.800
THAT'S WHAT YOU TOLD THEM
ABOUT ME, THAT I BURP?

15:20.800 --> 15:22.767
YOU JUST MADE UP
THAT CUTE LITTLE NOSE THING?

15:22.767 --> 15:24.733
- I DIDN'T MAKE IT UP.
LOOK, THERE IT IS. THERE IT IS.

15:24.733 --> 15:26.167
OW!

15:26.167 --> 15:27.533
- OH, ALL RIGHT!
ALL RIGHT!

15:27.533 --> 15:29.667
A LOT OF THINGS
HAVE BEEN SAID,

15:29.667 --> 15:31.467
AND I HAVE NO PROBLEM
FACING THE TRUTH,

15:31.467 --> 15:34.033
HOWEVER PAINFUL
IT MIGHT BE.

15:34.033 --> 15:36.300
NOW, ABOUT MY SAUCE,

15:36.300 --> 15:39.167
FRANK, TELL THEM
YOU'RE A LIAR.

15:44.067 --> 15:45.267
- WHAT?

15:45.267 --> 15:47.800
- DO YOU EVER WANT
TO EAT AGAIN?

15:47.800 --> 15:49.633
- I LIED.

15:49.633 --> 15:52.600
I'M A CRAZY OLD MAN
WHO LIES.

15:56.767 --> 15:58.133
- GOOD.

15:58.133 --> 16:00.033
AND I'M GLAD
THAT YOU COULD ADMIT THAT.

16:00.033 --> 16:02.867
AND YOU SHOULD ALL KNOW BETTER
THAN TO ENGAGE IN IDLE GOSSIP.

16:02.867 --> 16:04.167
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

16:04.167 --> 16:05.233
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO BLABBED IT TO DEBRA

16:05.233 --> 16:06.567
ABOUT CHOO-CHOO CHULESKY.

16:06.567 --> 16:07.900
- I DO NOT BLAB!

16:07.900 --> 16:12.233
WHAT I DO
COMES FROM LOVE.

16:12.233 --> 16:13.500
AND IF YOU WANT TO KNOW
THE TRUTH,

16:13.500 --> 16:15.300
DEBRA IS THE WORST GOSSIP
OF US ALL.

16:15.300 --> 16:17.300
- ME? YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO ONCE TOLD ME

16:17.300 --> 16:19.900
THAT FRANK CAME TO BED
WITH A TOUPEE ON FOR YOU.

16:19.900 --> 16:24.200
- WHAT?

16:24.200 --> 16:26.467
- THIS IS AN OUTRAGE,
MARIE.

16:26.467 --> 16:29.867
THAT WAS A HAT
I FOUND ON THE STREET.

16:29.867 --> 16:31.300
- OH, REALLY?

16:31.300 --> 16:34.900
AND WHAT ABOUT WHAT DEBRA
TOLD AMY LAST JULY?

16:34.900 --> 16:36.133
- WHAT?

16:36.133 --> 16:38.200
- DEBRA TOLD AMY
THAT RAYMOND THOUGHT

16:38.200 --> 16:39.600
THAT AMY
AND ROBERT'S MARRIAGE

16:39.600 --> 16:41.333
DIDN'T HAVE
A CHANCE IN HELL.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.100
- MARIE,
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

16:43.100 --> 16:44.767
- MARIE, I TOLD YOU THAT
IN CONFIDENCE!

16:44.767 --> 16:46.767
- AMY, HOW COULD YOU TELL MARIE
THAT I SAID THAT?

16:46.767 --> 16:48.600
- DEBRA, HOW COULD YOU TELL AMY
WHAT I TOLD YOU?

16:48.600 --> 16:52.567
- MY MARRIAGE DOESN'T HAVE
A CHANCE IN HELL?

16:52.567 --> 16:54.733
- [belches]

17:04.967 --> 17:09.500
EXCUSE ME.

17:09.500 --> 17:11.167
- I DIDN'T SAY
YOUR MARRIAGE

17:11.167 --> 17:14.033
DOESN'T HAVE
A CHANCE IN HELL...

17:14.033 --> 17:17.900
THE WAY THAT SOUNDS.

17:17.900 --> 17:19.367
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

17:19.367 --> 17:21.300
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS
THAT A MAN SAYS TO HIS WIFE

17:21.300 --> 17:23.267
WHEN HE'S JUST TRYING TO,
I DON'T KNOW,

17:23.267 --> 17:26.433
FILL THE SILENCE.

17:28.200 --> 17:31.033
- OH...
NOW I UNDERSTAND.

17:31.033 --> 17:33.833
YOU'RE A HATEFUL JERK-FACE.

17:33.833 --> 17:36.133
AND WHAT I MEAN
BY THAT IS,

17:36.133 --> 17:39.533
YOU'RE HATEFUL,
AND YOU'RE A JERK-FACE.

17:39.533 --> 17:41.333
- WHY DID YOU HAVE
TO TELL AMY THAT?

17:41.333 --> 17:44.100
- I WAS JUST TALKING TO AMY
ABOUT THE STUPID THINGS MEN SAY.

17:44.100 --> 17:45.600
WE ALL DO IT.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.567
AMY KNEW WHAT I MEANT.
SHE WAS OKAY WITH IT.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.133
YOU WERE OKAY
WITH IT, RIGHT?

17:49.133 --> 17:51.400
- ACTUALLY,
I WAS PRETTY UPSET.

17:51.400 --> 17:55.900
- THAT'S WHY
SHE CAME TO ME.

17:55.900 --> 17:57.267
- OKAY, SEE?
SHE WAS UPSET.

17:57.267 --> 17:58.800
- YEAH, BUT YOU'RE
THE ONE WHO SAID IT.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.433
- YEAH, B--

18:00.433 --> 18:03.133
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

18:03.133 --> 18:04.533
YOU'VE BEEN WALKING
AROUND,

18:04.533 --> 18:06.100
SECRETLY THINKING
I'M A HATEFUL JERK-FACE

18:06.100 --> 18:08.400
BUT STILL ACTING
ALL FAKE NICE TO ME?

18:08.400 --> 18:12.200
- I HAVEN'T BEEN
THAT NICE.

18:12.200 --> 18:13.567
A FEW MONTHS AGO,
YOU GOT A HAIRCUT,

18:13.567 --> 18:15.567
AND EVERYBODY SAID,
"NICE HAIRCUT, RAY,"

18:15.567 --> 18:18.567
BUT I DIDN'T.

18:20.567 --> 18:21.967
- HOW COULD YOU
DO THAT TO ME?

18:21.967 --> 18:23.067
I MEAN,
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

18:23.067 --> 18:24.633
- YOU HURT MY FEELINGS.

18:24.633 --> 18:27.067
- STILL, YOU THINK SOMEBODY'S
A HATEFUL JERK-FACE,

18:27.067 --> 18:28.367
YOU GOT TO TELL 'EM.

18:28.367 --> 18:29.667
I HAVE FEELINGS TOO.

18:29.667 --> 18:32.533
- HATEFUL JERK-FACE.
FEEL BETTER?

18:32.533 --> 18:35.167
- YOU SEE? YOU MADE ME
A HATEFUL JERK-FACE.

18:35.167 --> 18:36.700
- YOU KNOW, AMY,
RAY'S RIGHT.

18:36.700 --> 18:38.400
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW
I UPSET YOU IF YOU DON'T

18:38.400 --> 18:39.833
SAY ANYTHING TO ME?
I MEAN, COME ON.

18:39.833 --> 18:41.500
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
YOUR BEST FRIEND.

18:41.500 --> 18:44.133
- WHAT ABOUT ME?
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE HER HUSBAND!

18:44.133 --> 18:45.433
I'M YOUR HUSBAND!

18:45.433 --> 18:46.800
DON'T YOU KNOW,
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,

18:46.800 --> 18:49.200
TO TELL ME IMMEDIATELY
WHEN RAYMOND SCREWS UP?

18:49.200 --> 18:54.433
YOU PAGE ME AT WORK!

18:54.433 --> 18:56.600
- I MUST SAY, AMY,
BEFORE YOU CAME INTO THE FAMILY,

18:56.600 --> 18:58.433
WE WERE ALL JUST OPEN
WITH EACH OTHER.

18:58.433 --> 19:01.833
WE'D SAY WHATEVER
WAS ON OUR MIND.

19:01.833 --> 19:03.167
AND NOW...

19:03.167 --> 19:06.267
WE HAVE TO TIPTOE
AROUND YOUR FEELINGS.

19:06.267 --> 19:10.033
- IT'S NOT FAIR, AMY.

19:10.033 --> 19:13.600
- YEAH, AMY,
SEE WHAT YOU DID?

19:14.967 --> 19:17.333
- [sobs]

19:17.333 --> 19:20.567
- AH, JEEZ.
THERE SHE GOES AGAIN.

19:23.700 --> 19:27.000
- ROBERT, GET IN THERE.

19:29.167 --> 19:31.367
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I DID WRONG.

19:31.367 --> 19:33.200
I WAS BROUGHT UP
TO BE NICE.

19:33.200 --> 19:36.667
I NEVER SAY ANYTHING BAD
ABOUT ANYBODY.

19:36.667 --> 19:39.767
WHAT DO YOU PEOPLE WANT?

19:39.767 --> 19:43.100
ALL I EVER WANTED TO DO
WAS TO FIT INTO THIS FAMILY.

19:45.800 --> 19:47.167
- OH, HONEY.

19:47.167 --> 19:49.533
YOU DO FIT IN.

19:49.533 --> 19:54.300
- I HATE TO SAY IT,
AMY, BUT YOU DO.

19:54.300 --> 19:55.433
- YEAH, I'M SORRY
ABOUT ALL THAT STUFF

19:55.433 --> 19:56.733
I SAID
ABOUT YOU AND ROBERT.

19:56.733 --> 19:59.967
YOU DEFINITELY HAVE
A CHANCE IN HELL.

19:59.967 --> 20:01.167
- THANK YOU, RAY.

20:01.167 --> 20:02.600
AND THAT WAS
A NICE HAIRCUT.

20:02.600 --> 20:06.100
- THANKS.
I SWITCHED BARBERS.

20:06.100 --> 20:08.367
- AW, YOU SEE, AMY?

20:08.367 --> 20:10.967
YOU DO HAVE A PLACE
IN OUR FAMILY,

20:10.967 --> 20:14.367
AND WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE
A PLACE FOR YOU.

20:14.367 --> 20:18.433
- HERE YOU GO,
SWEETIE.

20:23.233 --> 20:26.767
- ROBERT,
I HAVE TO SPEAK UP.

20:26.767 --> 20:30.000
YOU'RE KILLING ME.

20:34.267 --> 20:37.433
- WOMEN.
THEY'RE NEVER SATISFIED.

20:45.933 --> 20:47.700
- AH.

20:47.700 --> 20:49.800
- ARE YOU READY?

20:49.800 --> 20:51.033
OH, FRANK, COME ON!

20:51.033 --> 20:52.467
NO, DON'T TURN AROUND NOW.

20:52.467 --> 20:55.200
IT'S NOT EMBARRASSING.
IT'S FUNNY.

21:02.033 --> 21:05.700
[laughter]

21:09.867 --> 21:10.900
- [laughs]

21:10.900 --> 21:13.133
[gasps]
