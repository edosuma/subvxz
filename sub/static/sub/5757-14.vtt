WEBVTT

00:05.705 --> 00:09.543
SHE'S NOT HERE.
LOOKS LIKE SHE DIDN'T
COME HOME LAST NIGHT, EITHER.

00:09.577 --> 00:12.480
I WALKED TOBY OUTSIDE
AND WHEN I CAME BACK INSIDE,
IT WAS HERE.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.582
WE HAVE FIVE HOURS
TO OBEY OUR CHUCKY DOLLS.

00:16.650 --> 00:18.586
WHEN MY DAD CAME BACK
TO ROSEWOOD,

00:18.619 --> 00:23.224
HE HOOKED UP WITH MY MOM.
IS THIS TRUE?

00:23.257 --> 00:25.393
Toby: I THOUGHT WE FELT
THE SAME WAY ABOUT EACH OTHER.

00:25.426 --> 00:27.595
YOU DESERVED TO BE WITH SOMEBODY
WHO CAN BE HONEST WITH YOU.

00:27.628 --> 00:29.230
SO I'M SORRY.

00:29.263 --> 00:31.532
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
I THINK YOU NEED
TO LEAVE HOLLIS.

00:31.565 --> 00:34.168
WHAT WERE YOU AND NOEL KAHN
TALKING ABOUT TODAY?

00:34.202 --> 00:35.603
THE ENGLISH TEACHER
YOU THINK IS SO GREAT

00:35.636 --> 00:38.172
IS HAVING A THING
WITH ONE OF HIS STUDENTS.

00:38.206 --> 00:40.408
ARIA, HAVE YOU HEARD
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS?

00:40.441 --> 00:44.078
I'M NOT LEAVING HOLLIS,
BUT YOU ARE LEAVING EZRA.

00:44.112 --> 00:47.515
IF SPENCER'S PARENTS
FIND OUT ABOUT THIS,
THEY WILL RUIN YOU.

00:47.548 --> 00:50.418
I'VE DONE EVERYTHING
YOU'VE ASKED ME TO DO.

00:53.721 --> 00:58.292
THOSE ARE A SET OF LATITUDE
AND LONGITUDE COORDINATES.
DR. SULLIVAN!

00:58.326 --> 00:59.827
THERE'S SOMETHING DOWN THERE.

00:59.860 --> 01:02.430
( all scream )

01:02.463 --> 01:04.498
THEY SET US UP!

01:04.532 --> 01:06.267
Man: EVIDENCE DOESN'T LIE.

01:06.300 --> 01:08.869
WE'VE KNOWN ALL ALONG
WHAT THE MURDER WEAPON WAS.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.571
TONIGHT WE CAUGHT YOU
WITH IT.

01:10.604 --> 01:13.141
I WISH I COULD SEE
THOSE BITCHES RIGHT NOW.

01:13.174 --> 01:16.410
IT'S OVER, JEN.
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT THAT
CAN LINK US TO THAT NIGHT.

01:16.444 --> 01:18.812
SHE DESERVED
TO DIE LIKE THAT.

01:20.748 --> 01:25.253
( children laughing,
singing nursery rhyme )

01:25.286 --> 01:28.489
* PRETTY LITTLE LIAR
ALL BY YOURSELF *

01:28.522 --> 01:31.692
* SNEAK TO THE PARK,
DIG IN THE DARK *

01:31.725 --> 01:35.196
* TELLING LITTLE LIES
TO MAKE THEIR MARK *

01:39.900 --> 01:43.571
* I THINK I'M IN TROUBLE,
 I'M IN TROUBLE AGAIN *

01:43.604 --> 01:47.908
* I BEEN A BAD, BAD GIRL
 AND IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME *

01:47.941 --> 01:52.213
* IT'S A BAD SITUATION AND
 IT'S JUST GETTIN' WORSE... *

01:52.246 --> 01:55.649
ONLY AN HOUR
AND THIRTY MINUTES
TO GO.

01:55.683 --> 01:59.287
I THINK IT'S MORE
LIKE TWO HOURS,
BUT WHO'S COUNTING?

02:03.291 --> 02:06.394
HOW MANY HOURS YOU GOT LEFT?
SIX MONTHS.

02:06.427 --> 02:08.829
BUT YOUR MOMMA'S NOT
A BIG-SHOT LAWYER

02:08.862 --> 02:10.830
GETTING YOU AND YOUR PALS
COMMUNITY SERVICE

02:10.864 --> 02:12.700
FOR TAMPERING WITH EVIDENCE.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.835
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
THEY KILLED SOMEBODY.

02:14.868 --> 02:17.771
THAT'S WHAT THE COPS THINK,
BUT THE COPS CAN'T PROVE IT.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.540
COPS ARE STUPID.

02:19.573 --> 02:23.311
WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
 DON'T TALK TO THEM.

02:23.344 --> 02:25.179
I'LL TALK TO
ANYBODY I WANT TO.

02:25.213 --> 02:27.448
NO, YOU WON'T.
AND WHO'S GONNA STOP ME?

02:27.481 --> 02:30.218
BOTH OF YOU JUST SHUT UP.
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT ANYMORE.

02:31.619 --> 02:34.255
DID YOU AT LEAST
THINK ABOUT MY IDEA?

02:34.288 --> 02:37.491
IT WAS A BAD IDEA
WHEN THEY ARRESTED US,
IT'S A BAD IDEA NOW.

02:37.525 --> 02:40.361
WE FINALLY HAVE
SOMETHING SOLID.
WHY WON'T YOU USE IT?

02:40.394 --> 02:43.197
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T MAKE
A DEAL WITH A RATTLESNAKE.

02:43.231 --> 02:45.366
YOU CAN IF YOU HAVE
SOMETHING THE RATTLESNAKE WANTS.

02:45.399 --> 02:47.668
CAN WE STOP TALKING
ABOUT SNAKES?

02:47.701 --> 02:50.871
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE MAKING
ANY KIND OF A DEAL WITH "A."

02:50.904 --> 02:53.641
THAT'S FINAL.
MAYBE FOR YOU.

02:53.674 --> 02:56.877
THE REST OF US DON'T HAVE
LAWYERS FOR PARENTS.

02:56.910 --> 02:59.513
MEANING WHAT?

02:59.547 --> 03:01.782
MEANING YOUR MOM MAY HAVE
GOTTEN US A DEAL,

03:01.815 --> 03:04.385
BUT IF THEY EVER FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO CHARGE US
FOR KILLING ALI,

03:04.418 --> 03:08.456
SHE'LL THROW THE REST OF US
UNDER THE BUS TO SAVE YOU...
AND YOU'D LET HER.

03:14.362 --> 03:15.496
HEY!

03:15.529 --> 03:16.797
YOU GUYS, STOP!

03:21.335 --> 03:24.972
( all shouting )

03:25.005 --> 03:27.375
* I'M IN TROUBLE....

03:27.408 --> 03:28.809
WHOA! SPENCER, STOP!

03:28.842 --> 03:31.279
* I THINK I'M IN TROUBLE

03:32.880 --> 03:34.782
* TROUBLE AGAIN...

03:37.418 --> 03:39.987
* GOT A SECRET,
 CAN YOU KEEP IT *

03:40.020 --> 03:42.490
* SWEAR THIS ONE
 YOU'LL SAVE *

03:42.523 --> 03:44.925
* BETTER LOCK IT
 IN YOUR POCKET *

03:44.958 --> 03:47.561
* TAKING THIS ONE
 TO THE GRAVE *

03:47.595 --> 03:52.533
* IF I SHOW YOU THAT I KNOW
 YOU WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID *

03:52.566 --> 03:57.237
* 'CAUSE TWO CAN KEEP A SECRET
 IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD *

04:02.009 --> 04:04.645
CAN YOU AT LEAST TRY
TO BE CIVIL TO HER?
I AM CIVIL.

04:04.678 --> 04:08.649
HANNA, WHEN YOU AND EMILY
WALK INTO THE SAME ROOM,
THE SMOKE ALARMS GO OFF.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.884
IF EMILY'S PARENTS HAD
TAKEN HER BACK TO TEXAS,

04:10.918 --> 04:12.720
THE PLEA BARGAIN
WOULD HAVE FALLEN APART,

04:12.753 --> 04:14.655
YOU MIGHT HAVE
GONE TO JAIL.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.524
WHATEVER IT IS THAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU--

04:16.557 --> 04:18.858
HAVE YOU TALKED TO DAD
SINCE THE BIG EVENT?

04:18.892 --> 04:21.629
( sighs ) YES.

04:21.661 --> 04:23.797
HE STILL SEEMS MAD
WHEN HE TALKS TO ME.

04:23.831 --> 04:24.898
BECAUSE HE'S ANGRY.

04:24.932 --> 04:27.335
HE'S ANGRY, ISABEL'S ANGRY--

04:27.368 --> 04:29.670
I'M STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHY YOU DID WHAT YOU DID.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.539
I HAD TO STOP IT.

04:31.572 --> 04:34.375
YOU STOPPED THE WEDDING BUT
YOU DIDN'T STOP THE MARRIAGE.

04:34.408 --> 04:36.610
HE WANT BACK TO BALTIMORE
AND GOT MARRIED ANYWAY.

04:36.644 --> 04:38.846
YEAH, IN SOME
COURT JUSTICE'S OFFICE.

04:38.879 --> 04:43.417
WELL, AT LEAST CREEPY KATE
DIDN'T GET TO SHOW OFF
AT THE RECEPTION.

04:44.652 --> 04:47.020
GOOD MORNING.
GOOD MORNING, EMILY.

04:54.762 --> 04:56.364
( sighs )

04:58.732 --> 05:02.836
SO, HOW DOES IT FEEL
TO BE DONE WITH
COMMUNITY SERVICE?

05:02.870 --> 05:03.971
ALMOST DONE.

05:05.606 --> 05:07.608
THERE WAS A PROBLEM
IN THE PARK.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.843
SPENCER AND I HAVE TO DO
AN EXTRA TWO WEEKS.

05:11.845 --> 05:15.549
WELL, MAYBE THEN THINGS
CAN GET BACK TO NORMAL
FOR ALL OF YOU.

05:15.583 --> 05:17.851
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
WHAT NORMAL IS ANYMORE.

05:26.527 --> 05:29.062
HAVING YOU AND HANNA
UNDER THE SAME ROOF,

05:29.096 --> 05:32.433
I KNOW HOW HARD THIS HAS BEEN
FOR BOTH OF YOU.

05:32.466 --> 05:34.902
I HATE TO SEE THE FOUR OF YOU
DRIFTING APART.

05:34.935 --> 05:37.571
I WAS REALLY HOPING
THERE'S BE SOME KIND OF...

05:37.605 --> 05:39.373
THAW BY NOW.

05:41.174 --> 05:44.578
I DON'T THINK THAT'S SOMETHING
HANNA AND THE OTHER GIRLS WANT.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.748
( Fax machine rings )

05:55.022 --> 05:56.790
FAX IS FOR YOU.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.674
SO, YOU LIKE THIS GUY?

06:13.707 --> 06:15.576
HE'S OKAY.

06:15.609 --> 06:18.812
I MEAN, HE'S REALLY OLD,
BUT HE'S NOT A JERK.

06:18.846 --> 06:22.850
HE DOESN'T MAKE
THOSE LISTENING NOISES
LIKE MY FIRST THERAPIST.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.952
HE DIALED DOWN MY MEDS,

06:24.985 --> 06:27.821
AND HE DOESN'T LOOK AT ME
LIKE I'M A BOBBLEHEAD

06:27.855 --> 06:29.723
THE WAY I CATCH MOM AND DAD
SOMETIMES.

06:29.757 --> 06:31.592
THEY DO NOT LOOK AT YOU
LIKE YOU'RE A BOBBLEHEAD.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.861
REALLY? I STILL
CATCH THEM LOOKING.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.829
AND YOU TOO.

06:35.863 --> 06:38.966
WELL, WE JUST
WANT YOU TO BE OKAY.

06:38.999 --> 06:41.502
THAT'S TOUGH TO DO
WITH PEOPLE WAITING FOR YOU

06:41.535 --> 06:43.671
TO TURN INTO A ZOMBIE
OR SOMETHING.

06:43.704 --> 06:47.107
HMM. I ALWAYS SAW YOU AS MORE
OF THE CUTE WEREWOLF TYPE.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.212
HELLO.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.948
HEY, MIKE. ARIA.

06:54.982 --> 06:56.550
HI.

06:56.584 --> 06:57.951
HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
IN A WHILE.

06:57.985 --> 06:59.820
YEAH, I, UM,

06:59.853 --> 07:02.956
I DON'T REALLY GET OVER
TO HOLLIS ANYMORE.

07:02.990 --> 07:05.225
HAVE THINGS TO DO
AROUND HERE.

07:05.258 --> 07:09.663
SO, I STILL HAVE
THAT IVY DUNBAR BOOK
THAT YOU LENT ME.

07:09.697 --> 07:13.033
THE ESSAYS. I KNOW THAT
YOU SAID IT'S PRETTY RARE,

07:13.066 --> 07:15.703
SO YOU PROBABLY WANT THAT BACK.
NO, IT'S OKAY.

07:15.736 --> 07:18.238
NO RUSH. AS LONG AS
I KNOW YOU HAVE IT.

07:18.271 --> 07:21.509
I DO. I REALLY
LIKE HER WRITING.

07:21.542 --> 07:23.443
YEAH. I KNEW YOU WOULD.

07:26.046 --> 07:29.016
MIKE, WOULD YOU--
WOULD YOU GO...?

07:29.049 --> 07:30.217
SURE.

07:33.153 --> 07:34.722
HOW ARE YOU?

07:34.755 --> 07:36.757
NUMB.
LOOK, I'M SORRY.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.158
ARIA--
NO--

07:38.191 --> 07:40.628
I CAN'T HANDLE IT.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.996
MY MOM THINKING THAT
YOU WERE WITH SPENCER--

07:43.030 --> 07:45.599
DON'T WORRY,
SHE HASN'T TOLD ANYBODY.

07:50.303 --> 07:53.507
THE TROUBLE WITH THE POLICE--
I CAN'T LET ANYTHING BAD
HAPPEN TO YOU.

07:53.541 --> 07:57.144
ARIA, SOMETHING BAD
 HAS HAPPENED. YOU WON'T
 LET ME SEE YOU.

07:59.780 --> 08:02.683
WELL...
WE GOTTA GO.

08:02.716 --> 08:04.885
YEAH, I GOTTA GO TOO.

08:04.918 --> 08:07.154
IT WAS GREAT
SEEING YOU, MIKE.

08:07.187 --> 08:09.289
MR. FITZ.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.191
BYE.
BYE.

08:16.964 --> 08:18.732
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU'RE NOT COMING?
I'M HERE.

08:18.766 --> 08:20.067
I'M WAITING FOR YOU.

08:21.802 --> 08:25.072
UM, I SHOULD PROBABLY GO.
WE'LL TALK LATER.

08:26.574 --> 08:27.841
HEY.

08:27.875 --> 08:29.810
ARE YOU BACK FOR
MORE DRIVERS ED?

08:29.843 --> 08:31.945
UH, ACTUALLY I WAS
HOPING TO SEE JENNA,

08:31.979 --> 08:33.714
BUT SHE'S STAYING HOME
TODAY.

08:33.746 --> 08:36.717
YOU TWO MAKE
AN INTERESTING COUPLE.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.986
HAS ANYBODY
EVER MENTIONED THAT?

08:39.019 --> 08:41.655
I MEAN, I LIKED IT BETTER
WHEN YOU GUYS WERE
KEEPING IT A BIG SECRET.

08:41.688 --> 08:44.124
NOW ALL THE MYSTERY'S GONE.

08:44.157 --> 08:46.860
IT WAS NEVER SECRET.
IT WAS PRIVATE.

08:46.894 --> 08:50.197
WHEN THE TIME WAS RIGHT,
WE LET PEOPLE KNOW.

08:50.230 --> 08:54.267
YEAH, WELL,
TIMING IS EVERYTHING.

08:54.301 --> 08:59.306
YOU KEEP SAYING THINGS TO ME
LIKE THEY'RE SUPPOSED
TO MEAN SOMETHING.

08:59.339 --> 09:02.610
NO, NO, JUST THAT IT'S
INTERESTING, YOU KNOW,
THE TIMING OF THINGS.

09:02.643 --> 09:05.579
LIKE THE SHOVEL
THAT KILLED ALI TURNS UP,

09:05.613 --> 09:08.616
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN
YOU TWO ARE HOLDING HANDS
IN THE TOWN SQUARE.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.718
LOOK, JUST BECAUSE
TWO THINGS HAPPEN
AT THE SAME TIME

09:10.751 --> 09:12.352
DOESN'T MEAN
THEY'RE CONNECTED.

09:12.385 --> 09:15.055
WELL, YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT
THINGS BEING CONNECTED,
DON'T YOU?

09:15.088 --> 09:17.658
AGAIN, IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN SOMETHING?

09:17.691 --> 09:19.693
YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT
CONNECTIONS.

09:19.727 --> 09:22.329
LIKE YOU'RE CONNECTED
TO JENNA

09:22.362 --> 09:25.666
AND IAN AND JASON...

09:25.699 --> 09:29.903
ALMOST LIKE YOU GUYS ARE
MEMBERS OF THE SAME CLUB.

09:29.937 --> 09:32.105
HEY, WHERE IS JASON,
ANYWAYS?

09:32.139 --> 09:34.842
NOBODY'S SEEN HIM SINCE
THE NIGHT WE WERE ARRESTED.

09:34.875 --> 09:37.377
HE WAS AT THE POLICE STATION,
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN
HE'S GONE...

09:37.410 --> 09:40.347
YOU WERE THERE THAT NIGHT.
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS?

09:40.380 --> 09:44.017
MAYBE HE GOT TIRED
OF YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS

09:44.051 --> 09:47.821
AND HE JUST WENT AWAY...
LIKE DR. SULLIVAN.

09:54.127 --> 09:57.364
ALL MY BLOOD LEVELS ARE GOOD,
THE ULCER'S COMPLETELY
UNDER CONTROL.

09:57.397 --> 09:59.399
I'M TOTALLY OKAY
TO SWIM AGAIN.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.835
SEE? NO EXERCISE
RESTRICTIONS.

10:01.869 --> 10:04.137
THAT'S REALLY GREAT, EMILY.

10:04.171 --> 10:05.706
I CAN BE AT PRACTICE
TOMORROW.

10:05.739 --> 10:08.709
I HOPE WE CAN
WORK SOMETHING OUT.

10:08.742 --> 10:12.279
IT'S ALREADY WORKED OUT.
I'VE GOT A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH.

10:12.312 --> 10:14.782
YOU'VE GOT IT
RIGHT IN YOUR HAND.

10:14.815 --> 10:17.651
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT
YOUR HEALTH, EMILY.

10:17.685 --> 10:20.320
BEING ON A TEAM
IS A PRIVILEGE,
NOT A RIGHT.

10:20.353 --> 10:23.223
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT,
DON'T YOU?

10:24.958 --> 10:28.028
I'M ALMOST FINISHED
WITH COMMUNITY SERVICE.

10:28.061 --> 10:30.664
WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT
WHAT IT MEANS TO THE TEAM--

10:30.698 --> 10:34.802
THE SORT OF SIGNAL
IT SENDS TO THE OTHER SCHOOLS
IF WE LET YOU BACK.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.670
WHAT EXACTLY
ARE YOU TELLING ME?

10:36.704 --> 10:38.806
I'M TELLING YOU
IT'S NOT MY CALL.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.307
I HAVE TO TALK
TO THE PRINCIPAL.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.109
I'M SORRY.

10:46.246 --> 10:50.684
UM, THIS IS
MY EXTRA-CREDIT REPORT
ON VONNEGUT.

10:50.718 --> 10:52.352
THANK YOU.

10:52.385 --> 10:54.822
SO IT'S OKAY?

10:54.855 --> 10:56.924
I LOOK FORWARD
TO READING IT.

11:01.328 --> 11:02.963
HEY!
SORRY.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.435
STOP IT!

11:08.468 --> 11:10.838
I'M TIRED OF MAKING
ALLOWANCES FOR YOU GUYS.

11:10.871 --> 11:14.307
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE FRIENDS.
NOW GO SIT DOWN.

11:21.248 --> 11:22.983
( cell phone plinks )

12:01.789 --> 12:02.923
BECAUSE OF MIKE?

12:02.956 --> 12:05.192
NO, 'CAUSE I JUST...
I CAN'T.

12:05.225 --> 12:08.328
THERE WAS NOTHING YOU COULD DO.
YOU HAD TO BREAK UP WITH HIM.

12:08.361 --> 12:09.997
I KNOW.

12:10.030 --> 12:12.365
WE'VE ALL GOT SOMEBODY
WE WANT TO PROTECT FROM "A."

12:12.399 --> 12:15.769
AND ON TOP OF ALL THAT,
YOU'VE GOT JACKIE THE EX
TO WORRY ABOUT.

12:15.803 --> 12:18.806
WHAT DID HE EVER
SEE IN HER, ANYWAY?
I HAVE NO IDEA.

12:18.839 --> 12:21.141
MAYBE SHE WAS
A LATE-ONSET PSYCHO.

12:21.174 --> 12:23.310
WELL, WE'LL TAKE CARE OF JACKIE,

12:23.343 --> 12:25.345
BUT RIGHT NOW WE JUST
HAVE TO DO WHAT SPENCER SAID,

12:25.378 --> 12:28.816
JUST SLAY ONE DRAGON
AT A TIME. OKAY?

12:30.117 --> 12:31.318
OKAY.

13:01.348 --> 13:03.851
HEY. I FOUND
ANOTHER ONE.

13:03.884 --> 13:05.585
OH, NO.
WHAT CAN I SAY,

13:05.618 --> 13:07.454
YOU WERE ON
THE SIDE OF THE ROAD
FOR A MONTH

13:07.487 --> 13:08.922
AND THERE ARE A LOT
OF CELLPHONES IN THE WORLD.

13:08.956 --> 13:10.858
PEOPLE TAKE PICTURES.

13:10.891 --> 13:12.325
BUT WHY DO THEY HAVE TO
TAKE PICTURES OF ME

13:12.359 --> 13:14.928
IN AN ORANGE JUMPSUIT
PICKING UP BEER CANS?

13:14.962 --> 13:17.197
THIS ONE WASN'T SO BAD.
YOU LOOKED AT THEM?!

13:17.230 --> 13:20.367
I HAVE TO LOOK AT THEM
IF I'M GONNA FIND THEM
AND GET THEM TAKEN DOWN.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.501
SHOW 'EM TO ME.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.438
NO, NO. DON'T SHOW THEM TO ME.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.541
OKAY, LET ME LOOK.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.816
WHAT'S THAT?
UH, NOTHING.

13:38.251 --> 13:41.354
OH, GOD, I LOOK LIKE
A DEMENTED CREAMSICLE.

13:41.388 --> 13:42.622
IT'LL BE DOWN
BY TOMORROW.

13:42.655 --> 13:45.225
LOOK, YOU HAVE BEEN AMAZING,

13:45.258 --> 13:47.527
AND I'M SO, SO GRATEFUL TO YOU,

13:47.560 --> 13:51.031
BUT YOU'RE NEVER GONNA
FIND ALL OF THESE, ARE YOU?

13:51.064 --> 13:53.466
LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE.
IT IS THE INTERNET,

13:53.500 --> 13:55.402
YOU'RE UP AGAINST
TALKING DOGS

13:55.435 --> 13:58.105
AND PEOPLE EATING
BITS OF SOFA CUSHION--

13:58.138 --> 14:01.041
IT'S WAY MORE INTERESTING
THAN A PRETTY GIRL IN
AN ORANGE BAGGIE.

14:01.074 --> 14:03.543
I DO NOT LOOK PRETTY
IN THESE PICTURES.

14:03.576 --> 14:06.880
YOU DO. SORT OF.

14:06.914 --> 14:11.418
IN A POST-APOCALYPTIC-
RAG-TAG-BAND-OF-SURVIVORS
KIND OF WAY.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.420
OKAY, NOW YOU'RE JUST
TRYING TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

14:13.453 --> 14:15.188
AND HOW IS THAT WORKING?

14:15.222 --> 14:18.291
SURPRISINGLY WELL.

14:18.325 --> 14:22.129
I THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD WAY
TO TALK ABOUT ARCHITECTURE
IN CONTEXT.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.431
I MEAN, PEOPLE LIVED
IN THESE BUILDINGS.

14:24.464 --> 14:26.266
IT WAS THE REAL WORLD FOR THEM.

14:26.299 --> 14:29.536
ANYTHING THAT GETS PEOPLE
READING HENRY JAMES
IS FINE BY ME.

14:29.569 --> 14:31.404
YEAH, AND WE COULD
COMBINE CLASSES.

14:31.438 --> 14:33.006
WE'LL SHOW 'EM
 THE HEIRESS.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.008
COUNT ME IN.
( cellphone rings )

14:38.578 --> 14:40.180
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

14:40.213 --> 14:42.215
I NEVER USED TO WINCE
WHEN MY PHONE WENT OFF.

14:42.249 --> 14:45.218
NOW I'VE GOT JUDGES
AND LAWYERS ON MY SPEED-DIAL.

14:45.252 --> 14:46.653
IT'S A DIFFERENT WORLD.

14:46.686 --> 14:48.488
HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?

14:48.521 --> 14:50.690
ONE DAY AT A TIME.

14:50.723 --> 14:53.093
FAMILIES GET THROUGH
MUCH WORSE THAN THIS.

14:53.126 --> 14:55.595
EVERYBODY'S BEEN VERY POLITE
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED,

14:55.628 --> 14:58.631
VERY SYMPATHETIC...
AND I HATE IT.

14:58.665 --> 15:02.936
I KNOW THAT UNDERNEATH IT
THEY'RE JUST GLAD IT WASN'T
THEIR KID THAT GOT IN TROUBLE.

15:02.970 --> 15:05.605
I GUESS...I KNOW ARIA
WELL ENOUGH TO BELIEVE

15:05.638 --> 15:09.009
THAT SHE WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING
TO HURT YOU AND ELLA.

15:09.042 --> 15:13.013
WELL, NOBODY STARTS OUT
TO HURT ANYBODY.

15:13.046 --> 15:16.149
NO. NO, THEY DON'T.

15:16.183 --> 15:18.318
YOU SHOULD COME BACK OVER.
WE'LL FINISH THAT DINNER.

15:18.351 --> 15:20.954
AND THAT SCOTCH.
I WOULD LOVE IT.

15:20.988 --> 15:23.256
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL TALK TO ELLA.
GREAT.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.168
HEY.
HEY.

15:35.202 --> 15:39.172
YOU OKAY?
YEAH.

15:39.206 --> 15:43.076
YOU STOPPED PICKING UP
YOUR CELL, AND I DIDN'T
WANT TO CALL THE HOUSE.

15:43.110 --> 15:46.313
WELL, MY FOLKS
ARE IN PHILADELPHIA
WITH MELISSA.

15:46.346 --> 15:48.148
SOMETHING WRONG?

15:48.181 --> 15:49.616
THEY WANTED HER
TO SEE A SPECIALIST.

15:49.649 --> 15:52.352
THERE'S SOMETHING IRREGULAR
ABOUT HER HEART RATE,

15:52.385 --> 15:55.255
SO SHE'S HAVING TESTS DONE.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.224
YOU OKAY OUT HERE ALONE?

15:57.257 --> 15:58.725
YEAH.

15:58.758 --> 16:01.628
YOU'RE FINISHED WITH
COMMUNITY SERVICE, RIGHT?

16:01.661 --> 16:06.066
WELL, NO. THEY TACKED ON
TWO MORE WEEKS.
WHY?

16:06.099 --> 16:08.501
BECAUSE EMILY AND I
HAD A FIGHT.

16:08.535 --> 16:11.604
WH-WHAT'S GOING ON?
YOU'RE BEST FRIENDS.

16:11.638 --> 16:15.075
I'M GETTING REALLY TIRED
OF PEOPLE TELLING ME
WHO MY FRIENDS ARE.

16:15.108 --> 16:16.576
WELL...

16:18.645 --> 16:21.281
TWO WEEKS IS CLOSE ENOUGH.

16:34.661 --> 16:37.030
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

16:37.064 --> 16:39.432
I MADE IT FOR YOU.

16:40.800 --> 16:43.470
I CAN'T TAKE IT.
WHY NOT?

16:43.503 --> 16:46.073
WE'VE BEEN OVER THIS.
I TOLD YOU THE NIGHT
THEY ARRESTED YOU,

16:46.106 --> 16:48.075
I'M NOT WALKING AWAY.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.043
DO YOU HEAR
WHAT YOU JUST SAID?

16:50.077 --> 16:52.645
THE NIGHT THAT I WAS ARRESTED?
I DON'T CARE.

16:52.679 --> 16:55.515
WELL, I DO!
PLEASE, TOBY, I DO.

16:55.548 --> 16:57.350
YOU HAVE TO STAY AWAY FROM ME!

16:59.352 --> 17:00.787
I CAN HANDLE YOUR FATHER.

17:00.820 --> 17:02.689
THIS ISN'T ABOUT MY FATHER.
THEN WHAT IS IT?

17:02.722 --> 17:05.325
I DON'T WANT YOU
"HANDLING" MY FATHER.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.694
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO
LOOK OVER MY SHOULDER
AND FIND YOU THERE.

17:07.727 --> 17:10.163
WHAT I WANT IS FOR YOU
TO FORGET ABOUT ME.

17:10.196 --> 17:12.398
IF YOU REALLY WANT
TO WORRY ABOUT SOMEBODY,

17:12.432 --> 17:14.800
WHY DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT
YOUR SISTER AND THAT
COP BOYFRIEND OF HERS?

17:30.850 --> 17:32.285
( owl hooting )

18:09.856 --> 18:11.724
"YOU WERE ALWAYS MY FAVORITE.

18:11.758 --> 18:14.127
WANT TO MAKE A DEAL?"

18:15.462 --> 18:16.796
"A" TOOK THE BAIT.

18:23.236 --> 18:25.138
WE PULLED IT OFF.

18:27.507 --> 18:29.609
"A" TOTALLY THINK
WE'RE NOT FRIENDS ANYMORE.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.711
THEY THINK THAT WE HAVE
REAL EVIDENCE.

18:31.744 --> 18:34.747
DOES IT BOTHER ANYBODY
THAT WE DON'T ACTUALLY
HAVE ANYTHING,

18:34.781 --> 18:37.684
WE'RE JUST MAKING IT UP?
BUT JENNA AND GARRETT
DON'T KNOW THAT.

18:37.717 --> 18:40.620
I JUST SCARES ME THAT
EMILY'S DOING THIS ALONE.

18:40.653 --> 18:42.622
SHE'S NOT GONNA BE ALONE.
WE'LL BE OUTSIDE.

18:42.655 --> 18:44.691
YEAH, BUT IT'S JUST
THE FOUR OF US.

18:44.724 --> 18:47.627
EVERY TIME
WE ASK SOMEONE FOR HELP,
THEY END UP COLLATERAL DAMAGE.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.262
LIKE DR. SULLIVAN.

18:49.296 --> 18:50.797
OR A TRAITOR, LIKE GARRETT.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.932
IT WAS SO CREEPY TO
HAVE TO TALK TO HIM,

18:52.965 --> 18:56.303
BUT IT WAS TOTALLY WORTH IT
TO RATTLE THE CAGE.

18:56.336 --> 18:58.371
SO TOMORROW.

18:58.405 --> 19:00.407
AND EVERYONE THAT'S WATCHING
IS GOING TO BELIEVE

19:00.440 --> 19:01.708
THAT EMILY TOTALLY WENT ROGUE

19:01.741 --> 19:03.576
AND THAT SHE WANTS
THE BOX THAT JASON GAVE ME.

19:03.610 --> 19:06.179
THE ONE WITH THE EVIDENCE...
THAT DOESN'T REALLY EXIST.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.949
ARE YOU SURE THAT "A"
IS GONNA FOLLOW EMILY?

19:09.982 --> 19:12.419
ABSOLUTELY.

19:12.452 --> 19:14.321
I'M THE WEAKEST LINK.

19:14.354 --> 19:17.624
AND THE WEAKEST LINK
WANTS SOME PAYBACK.

19:20.760 --> 19:25.632
SO WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN A COMIC BOOK
AND A GRAPHIC NOVEL?

19:25.665 --> 19:27.567
ABOUT 12.98.

19:30.237 --> 19:31.871
DID YOU MISS ME?

20:07.540 --> 20:10.610
HE FOLLOWS HER AROUND
LIKE A TRAINED MONKEY.

20:10.643 --> 20:14.514
IT'S WORSE WHEN
HE COMES TO THE HOUSE.

20:14.547 --> 20:17.317
I DIDN'T SEE JENNA.
IS SHE HERE?

20:17.350 --> 20:19.419
MUST BE IN THE GIRLS' ROOM.

20:26.326 --> 20:28.428
STILL SUPPORTING
THE SHARKS?

20:28.461 --> 20:30.830
THEY'RE SWIMMING
AGAINST ROLLINS HIGH.

20:30.863 --> 20:32.699
THOUGHT I'D MAKE SOME NOISE.

20:32.732 --> 20:35.502
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?
SURE.

20:35.535 --> 20:37.570
WHAT THE HELL IS
GOING ON WITH SPENCER?

20:37.604 --> 20:40.307
YOU'LL HAVE TO
TALK TO HER ABOUT THAT.

20:40.340 --> 20:42.275
SHE'S NOT TALKING.

20:42.309 --> 20:44.911
I REALLY CAN'T HELP YOU
WITH SPENCER. SORRY.

20:44.944 --> 20:47.013
EMILY.

20:47.046 --> 20:48.815
DON'T YOU SHUT ME OUT, TOO.

20:51.418 --> 20:53.353
I'M NOT SHUTTING YOU OUT.

20:53.386 --> 20:56.323
IT'S JUST NOT GOOD FOR
ANY OF US RIGHT NOW, TOBY.

21:23.916 --> 21:26.319
Jackie:
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

21:26.353 --> 21:29.356
YOU'VE GOT
A VERY SHORT MEMORY.

21:29.389 --> 21:32.825
WE HAD A DEAL.
YOU WERE GOING TO
STAY AWAY FROM HIM.

21:32.859 --> 21:35.695
I DID STAY AWAY FROM HIM.
WE BROKE UP.

21:35.728 --> 21:38.097
I'M JUST RETURNING A BOOK.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.533
RETURNING A BOOK.
I SAW.

21:40.567 --> 21:42.068
LOOK, I DIDN'T--

21:42.101 --> 21:45.004
I DIDN'T LEAVE IT.
I WAS TAKING IT WITH ME.

21:45.037 --> 21:47.707
I CAN SHOW THIS
TO YOUR FATHER TOO.

21:47.740 --> 21:49.676
YOU THINK I WON'T DO
WHAT I PROMISED?

21:49.709 --> 21:52.879
THIS IS YOUR GAME.
YOU PICKED THE RULES.

22:07.394 --> 22:09.896
AT LEAST I KNOW WHY
YOU BROKE UP WITH ME.

22:09.929 --> 22:14.133
BEFORE JACKIE, I DON'T THINK
I UNDERSTOOD HOW...

22:14.166 --> 22:18.705
HOW DANGEROUS IT WAS
WHAT WE WERE DOING.

22:20.840 --> 22:25.011
DID YOU STOP BECAUSE OF JACKIE?
OR BECAUSE YOU WERE AFRAID?

22:25.044 --> 22:28.014
I WAS AFRAID FOR YOU.

22:28.047 --> 22:31.951
I DIDN'T WANT TO
SEE YOU GET HURT.

22:31.984 --> 22:34.454
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOUR MOTHER
THE TRUTH ABOUT US
AT THE POLICE STATION.

22:34.487 --> 22:37.824
YOU TRIED.
I SHOULD HAVE TRIED HARDER.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.826
BUT I SAW THAT LOOK
IN HER EYE,

22:39.859 --> 22:42.695
THAT STEELY
"I KNOW WHAT YOU'VE DONE" LOOK,

22:42.729 --> 22:44.897
AND I FOLDED.

22:44.931 --> 22:47.400
I KNOW THAT LOOK.

22:57.977 --> 22:59.412
I HAVE TO GO.

23:01.147 --> 23:03.983
ARIA.

23:04.016 --> 23:08.488
I'M NOT GONNA LET JACKIE
DESTROY ANYTHING OR ANYBODY.

23:08.521 --> 23:10.757
SHE MEANS WHAT SHE SAID.

23:12.124 --> 23:13.893
YOU STILL TRUST ME?

23:13.926 --> 23:16.563
YEAH, I DO.

23:16.596 --> 23:21.167
THEN THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU AND I NEED TO DO
THIS AFTERNOON.

23:23.870 --> 23:25.538
( all cheering )

23:27.640 --> 23:29.776
( cheers in distance )

23:31.811 --> 23:33.646
HEY.

23:33.680 --> 23:36.082
YOU'RE MISSING
ALL THE ACTION.

23:36.115 --> 23:37.784
TOO MUCH CHLORINE.

23:37.817 --> 23:39.619
YOU ALLERGIC?
INTOLERANT.

23:39.652 --> 23:41.821
THERE'S SUPPOSED TO
BE A DIFFERENCE.

23:44.056 --> 23:47.827
HEY, LISTEN, I WANTED
TO SAY THANK YOU FOR
KEEPING AN EYE ON HANNA

23:47.860 --> 23:49.762
WHILE I WAS AWAY.

23:49.796 --> 23:51.931
HOW'S CALIFORNIA?

23:51.964 --> 23:53.566
DIFFERENT.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.234
AND THE NEW FAMILY?

23:55.267 --> 23:57.937
I STILL SORT OF FEEL LIKE
A FOREIGN EXCHANGE STUDENT,

23:57.970 --> 23:59.105
BUT I LIKE THEM.

23:59.138 --> 24:00.707
AND THEY SEEM TO LIKE ME, SO...

24:00.740 --> 24:02.875
WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE?

24:04.210 --> 24:06.713
SO, ARE YOU GOING BACK
FOR GOOD?

24:06.746 --> 24:08.648
HMM. IT'S COMPLICATED.

24:08.681 --> 24:11.851
MY MOM GAVE UP
HER PARENTAL RIGHTS.
YOU CAN'T JUST CHANGE THAT.

24:11.884 --> 24:15.588
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
LAWYERS ARE FOR.

24:17.189 --> 24:19.959
I THOUGHT I WOULD STAY HERE
AND FINISH OUT THE SCHOOL YEAR.

24:19.992 --> 24:23.696
AND THEN WHAT?
FIGURE IT OUT
WHEN I FINISH.

24:23.730 --> 24:25.665
BUT HEY,
IF YOU CAN'T PUT ME UP,

24:25.698 --> 24:27.534
I'LL TOTALLY
FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

24:27.567 --> 24:29.802
NO, YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME
TO STAY WITH ME.

24:29.836 --> 24:33.840
I WAS JUST WONDERING
HOW LONG YOU'D BE AROUND.

24:33.873 --> 24:37.577
SO, HAVE YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT THE FUTURE?

24:37.610 --> 24:39.912
LUCAS, I OWE YOU A LOT,

24:39.946 --> 24:41.981
BUT RIGHT NOW YOU'RE TALKING
LIKE A GUIDANCE COUNSELOR.

24:42.014 --> 24:43.282
YOU DON'T OWE ME
ANYTHING.

24:43.315 --> 24:44.917
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

24:44.951 --> 24:46.853
IF YOU HADN'T TALKED ME
INTO COMING BACK TO TOWN,

24:46.886 --> 24:50.289
NONE OF THIS
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.
THAT THOUGHT DID OCCUR TO ME.

24:50.322 --> 24:53.492
IF I MAKE PLANS,
YOU'LL KNOW ABOUT THEM.

24:55.161 --> 24:58.865
I'M NOT THE ONE YOU NEED
TO KEEP IN YOUR PLANS.

24:58.898 --> 25:01.801
DON'T WORRY ABOUT HANNA,
OKAY?

25:05.805 --> 25:07.740
( cheers from swim meet )

25:09.141 --> 25:12.044
HEY, IT'S LAST EVENT,
THE LAST HEAT.

25:12.078 --> 25:15.247
WHERE IS ARIA?
WE SAID THAT WE WERE
GONNA DO THIS TOGETHER.

25:15.281 --> 25:17.984
I'M SORRY.
IT'S COMPLICATED.

25:18.017 --> 25:19.752
SO IS THIS.
I'M HERE, OKAY?

25:23.155 --> 25:25.024
( chatter )

25:32.865 --> 25:35.902
OKAY, IT'S EVERY MAN
FOR HIMSELF.

25:35.935 --> 25:37.904
I WANT THE BOX
THAT JASON GAVE ARIA.

25:37.937 --> 25:39.305
WELL, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA GET IT.

25:39.338 --> 25:42.108
GUYS, SPENCER'S ONLY
LOOKING OUT FOR HERSELF.

25:42.141 --> 25:44.143
WE HAVE TO CUT A DEAL WITH--
SHUT UP, EMILY.

25:44.176 --> 25:45.778
WHERE IS IT?
IT'S SAFE.

25:45.812 --> 25:46.879
WHERE?
DON'T TELL HER.

25:46.913 --> 25:48.247
IT'S HIDDEN,

25:48.280 --> 25:50.583
AND IT STAYS HIDDEN
UNTIL I WANT IT FOUND.

25:50.617 --> 25:54.186
YOU FORGET,
WE ALL LEARNED HOW TO KEEP
SECRETS FROM THE SAME PERSON.

25:54.220 --> 25:56.756
I BET I KNOW WHERE IT IS.

25:56.789 --> 25:58.891
GOOD LUCK.
HMM.

26:03.796 --> 26:05.598
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

26:08.835 --> 26:10.302
( cellphone plinks )

26:27.019 --> 26:29.856
I WANTED TO CLARIFY SOMETHING.

26:29.889 --> 26:34.193
WE WANTED TO TELL YOU
 SOMETHING IMPORTANT.

26:43.770 --> 26:45.772
I'M IN LOVE
WITH YOUR DAUGHTER.

26:54.914 --> 26:56.048
I LOVE ARIA.

27:05.958 --> 27:07.293
( clears throat )

27:13.966 --> 27:16.235
WE MET BEFORE
SCHOOL STARTED THIS YEAR.

27:20.139 --> 27:23.676
MIKE, YOU SHOULD
GO BACK UPSTAIRS.

27:25.712 --> 27:29.348
I WANTED YOU TO KNOW
THAT THIS STARTED
BEFORE ARIA WAS

27:29.381 --> 27:31.784
ASSIGNED TO MY CLASS.
WHAT STARTED?

27:31.818 --> 27:35.121
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
BEFORE SHE WAS "ASSIGNED"
TO YOUR CLASS?

27:35.154 --> 27:37.356
SHE WASN'T MY STUDENT...THEN.

27:37.389 --> 27:39.859
SHE WASN'T
YOUR STUDENT THEN?

27:39.892 --> 27:41.961
THIS CAN'T BE TRUE.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.896
IT IS. REALLY.

27:47.033 --> 27:48.300
I LOVE HIM.

27:51.904 --> 27:54.240
THIS WAS GOING ON...

27:54.273 --> 27:56.943
THIS HAPPENED WHILE
YOU WERE HER TEACHER?

27:56.976 --> 27:59.712
YES.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOUR STAYING?

27:59.746 --> 28:01.948
YES, I DO.
NO, I DON'T THINK YOU DO,

28:01.981 --> 28:05.885
BECAUSE IF YOU DID,
YOU WOULDN'T BE STANDING HERE.
YOU WOULDN'T DARE!

28:05.918 --> 28:06.886
ARIA, GO UPSTAIRS.

28:06.919 --> 28:08.487
TAKE MIKE WITH YOU.
NO.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.890
NO, I'M STAYING HERE.

28:10.923 --> 28:13.359
IF THIS IS TRUE,
WHAT YOU'RE TELLING US--
IT IS.

28:13.392 --> 28:15.161
NO!

28:15.194 --> 28:16.896
WHAT I'M HOPING CAN HAPPEN
IS THAT--

28:16.929 --> 28:18.765
NO. WHAT IS GONNA HAPPEN IS,

28:18.798 --> 28:20.399
YOU ARE GONNA
LEAVE THIS HOUSE RIGHT NOW.

28:20.432 --> 28:23.002
MR. MONTGOMERY--
END OF CONVERSATION.

28:23.035 --> 28:24.871
DAD, JUST--
ARIA, NO.

28:24.904 --> 28:26.839
BYRON--
I AM NOT ASKING YOU.

28:26.873 --> 28:29.008
I AM TELLING YOU.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.042
MIKE!

28:45.257 --> 28:47.026
MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO.

29:04.476 --> 29:07.546
I THOUGHT I KNEW
ABOUT SPENCER HASTINGS.

29:07.579 --> 29:09.415
SPENCER.

29:09.448 --> 29:12.484
YES. I SAW THEM TOGETHER, AND--

29:12.518 --> 29:14.854
YOU HEARD THE SAME RUMORS I DID.

29:14.887 --> 29:17.323
AND YOU TALKED TO HIM
ABOUT SPENCER?
YES.

29:17.356 --> 29:19.926
AND HE LIED TO YOUR FACE.

29:19.959 --> 29:24.897
WELL, MAYBE I DIDN'T
GIVE HIM A CHANCE
TO TELL ME THE TRUTH.

29:24.931 --> 29:26.999
WELL, THIS IS NOT ABOUT
TELLING THE TRUTH.

29:27.033 --> 29:30.036
THIS IS ABOUT WHAT HE DID.
HE'S FINISHED.

29:30.069 --> 29:31.303
THE MAN IS FINISHED.

29:31.337 --> 29:33.472
WELL, I SUPPOSE HE IS.

29:33.505 --> 29:34.841
YOU SUPPOSE?

29:34.874 --> 29:36.909
YOU WERE HERE,
YOU HEARD WHAT HE SAID.

29:36.943 --> 29:38.444
OF COURSE I DID.

29:38.477 --> 29:40.980
WHEN WHAT'S LEFT
TO SUPPOSE?

29:41.013 --> 29:45.151
IT'S JUST I REALIZE
THAT THIS HAPPENED
WHEN WE CAME HOME.

29:48.955 --> 29:50.522
THAT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS.

29:50.556 --> 29:53.292
I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT SHE WAS THINKING

29:53.325 --> 29:56.262
BY GETTING INVOLVED
WITH A TEACHER.

29:56.295 --> 29:58.130
WELL, THIS IS NOT ABOUT
WHAT SHE WAS THINKING;

29:58.164 --> 30:00.099
THIS IS ABOUT
WHAT HE DID.

30:00.132 --> 30:02.869
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE
WHO SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER.

30:02.902 --> 30:04.370
IT SHOULDN'T HAVE STARTED,

30:04.403 --> 30:08.140
BUT IT WAS HIS
RESPONSIBILITY TO STOP IT.

30:14.546 --> 30:16.415
CAN I SAY SOMETHING, PLEASE?

30:16.448 --> 30:19.118
OF COURSE YOU CAN.

30:21.487 --> 30:24.056
DON'T MAKE UP YOUR MINDS
RIGHT NOW.

30:25.925 --> 30:28.460
YOU CAN'T FIGURE OUT
IN ONE NIGHT

30:28.494 --> 30:31.931
WHAT I'M STILL TRYING
TO UNDERSTAND MYSELF.

30:35.201 --> 30:37.569
I LOVE YOU...

30:37.603 --> 30:39.939
SO MUCH.

30:41.207 --> 30:44.310
I LOVE HIM TOO.

30:44.343 --> 30:47.179
SO PLEASE, JUST--

30:47.213 --> 30:50.082
JUST IMAGINE FOR ONE MINUTE
THAT THIS IS REAL,

30:50.116 --> 30:52.584
BECAUSE IT IS,
I SWEAR THAT IT IS.

30:52.618 --> 30:56.388
JUST GO TO YOUR ROOM,
ARIA.

30:56.422 --> 30:58.024
DAD.

31:00.526 --> 31:02.328
MOM.

31:02.361 --> 31:04.296
GO...UPSTAIRS.

31:31.357 --> 31:33.592
DON'T BE ANGRY.

31:33.625 --> 31:39.131
ANGRY DOESN'T BEGIN
TO DESCRIBE HOW I FEEL
ABOUT YOU RIGHT NOW.

31:41.700 --> 31:44.070
WHO SAID YOU COULD COME IN?

31:44.103 --> 31:47.606
EZRA, YOU WERE MAKING
A TERRIBLE MISTAKE.

31:47.639 --> 31:51.610
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING
TO WAKE YOU UP TO WHAT
WAS HAPPENING.

31:53.145 --> 31:55.414
BAD IDEA TO WAKE
A SLEEPWALKER.

32:01.620 --> 32:03.990
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR LIP?

32:08.627 --> 32:11.063
YOU TOLD HER PARENTS.

32:11.097 --> 32:14.066
DID PROFESSOR MONTGOMERY
 HIT YOU?

32:14.100 --> 32:17.636
NO, THAT'S WHAT HER BROTHER
BROUGHT TO THE PARTY.

32:17.669 --> 32:20.272
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT
WAS GONNA HAPPEN?

32:21.673 --> 32:23.475
GO AWAY, JACKIE.

32:25.011 --> 32:27.346
SHE'S A TEENAGER...

32:27.379 --> 32:29.982
AND YOU WERE HER TEACHER.

32:37.523 --> 32:39.291
GET OUT.

32:39.325 --> 32:41.527
THERE'S NOTHING
I WANT FROM YOU.

32:41.560 --> 32:45.497
AND I WILL NOT LET YOU
DO ANYTHING TO HER.

32:45.531 --> 32:47.433
SO GET OUT.

33:03.049 --> 33:06.185
EMILY LEFT TEN MINUTES AGO.
I'M ALMOST AT THE DOOR.

33:06.218 --> 33:08.087
I'M GOING NOW.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.556
I'M TRYING TO THINK OF
WHAT WE'RE FORGETTING TO BRING.

33:15.194 --> 33:18.097
I THINK WE'RE ALL SET.
I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

33:18.130 --> 33:19.698
OKAY.

33:28.240 --> 33:30.209
HANNA...

33:30.242 --> 33:32.478
YOU CAN'T GO ANYWHERE
RIGHT NOW. YOUR FATHER'S
ON HIS WAY OVER.

33:32.511 --> 33:35.247
HE WANTS TO
TALK TO US TOGETHER.

33:43.555 --> 33:46.625
YOU WANT TO GIVE ME A HARD TIME,
THAT'S ONE THING, BUT YOU CAN'T
TREAT EMILY LIKE THAT.

33:46.658 --> 33:48.360
I'M NOT GONNA
LET THAT HAPPEN.

33:48.394 --> 33:50.096
WHAT IS GOING ON
IS BETWEEN EMILY AND ME,

33:50.129 --> 33:52.231
SO JUST FORGET IT.
FORGET IT?

33:52.264 --> 33:55.101
I'M JUST GONNA WATCH
TWO PEOPLE I CARE ABOUT
RIP INTO EACH OTHER?

33:55.134 --> 33:56.535
RIGHT. I'M GONNA DO THAT.

33:56.568 --> 33:58.704
FOR EVERYBODY'S SAKE,
JUST STAY OUT OF IT!

33:58.737 --> 34:00.406
STAY OUT OF WHAT, SPENCER?

34:00.439 --> 34:02.174
AFTER EVERYTHING
THAT'S HAPPENED,

34:02.208 --> 34:03.809
HOW CAN YOU JUST STAND THERE
AND TELL ME THERE'S SOMETHING

34:03.842 --> 34:05.544
I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO KNOW ABOUT?

34:05.577 --> 34:07.413
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO
TO MAKE YOU LEAVE ME ALONE?

34:07.446 --> 34:09.514
TELL ME ABOUT THE NIGHT
YOU FOUND THE SHOVEL.

34:09.547 --> 34:11.817
I TOLD YOU WHAT HAPPENED.
YEAH, YOU SAID SOMEBODY
TRICKED YOU INTO FINDING IT,

34:11.850 --> 34:13.784
AND I BELIEVE YOU,
BUT EVER SINCE THAT NIGHT,

34:13.819 --> 34:15.687
THE FOUR OF YOU
HAVE BEEN ACTING LIKE--
ACTING LIKE WHAT?!

34:15.721 --> 34:17.422
LIKE ALI IS STILL
RUNNING THINGS,

34:17.456 --> 34:19.558
PLAYING YOU
AGAINST EACH OTHER.

34:19.591 --> 34:23.829
TODAY AT SCHOOL,
YOU SOUNDED JUST LIKE ALI
WHEN YOU TALKED TO EMILY.

34:23.862 --> 34:27.498
JENNA ALWAYS SAID THAT
YOU WANTED TO TAKE ALI DOWN,

34:27.533 --> 34:29.435
REPLACE HER.

34:29.467 --> 34:32.103
I DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS TRUE
UNTIL TODAY.

34:32.138 --> 34:34.473
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.
THEN WHAT IS IT LIKE?

34:34.505 --> 34:36.442
I CAN'T DO THIS!
DON'T ASK ME!

34:36.475 --> 34:39.645
SPENCER--
NO! DON'T ASK ME NOW!
ASK ME AFTER TONIGHT.

34:39.678 --> 34:41.380
WHAT DIFFERENCE
IS ONE NIGHT GONNA MAKE?

34:41.413 --> 34:44.150
IT COULD CHANGE EVERYTHING,
BUT I NEED YOU TO LET ME GO.

34:44.183 --> 34:47.518
AND I NEED YOU TO PROMISE
THAT YOU WON'T FOLLOW ME.

34:56.795 --> 34:59.631
CONGRATULATIONS AGAIN
ON GETTING MARRIED.

34:59.665 --> 35:01.533
THANK YOU.

35:01.567 --> 35:04.270
WELL, AT LEAST NOW
YOU WON'T HAVE TO
SEND BACK ALL YOUR GIFTS.

35:04.303 --> 35:05.837
HANNA.

35:05.871 --> 35:08.307
SORRY.

35:08.340 --> 35:10.242
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
THAT'S ANGRY HERE, HANNA.

35:10.276 --> 35:11.743
THERE'S PLENTY OF THAT
TO GO AROUND.

35:11.777 --> 35:14.280
THAT'S SOMETHING
WE'RE GONNA DEAL WITH,

35:14.313 --> 35:16.248
AND WE'RE GONNA DEAL
WITH IT AS A FAMILY.

35:16.282 --> 35:17.849
WHICH FAMILY?

35:17.883 --> 35:20.652
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS
WE'RE GONNA WORK ON.

35:20.686 --> 35:24.523
WHICH IS WHY I WANTED TO
TALK TO YOU AT THE SAME TIME,
IN PERSON.

35:24.556 --> 35:29.428
I MADE SOME ARRANGEMENTS,
WE'RE MOVING BACK TO ROSEWOOD.

35:29.461 --> 35:31.230
"WE"?

35:31.263 --> 35:34.866
ME, ISABEL, KATE.

35:34.900 --> 35:38.304
KATE'S GOING TO BE IN ROSEWOOD?
MM-HMM.

35:38.337 --> 35:41.673
IS SHE GOING TO SCHOOL HERE?
YES, SHE IS.

35:43.475 --> 35:46.278
DAD, HOW COULD YOU
DO THAT TO ME?

35:50.416 --> 35:53.585
BECAUSE HE LOVES YOU...

35:53.619 --> 35:57.623
AND THIS WAY
HE CAN BE NEAR YOU.

35:57.656 --> 36:00.392
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, TOM?

36:39.865 --> 36:43.735
OH, MY GOD.
HE TOLD YOUR PARENTS?

36:43.769 --> 36:46.572
YEAH.
 WHAT HAPPENED?

36:46.605 --> 36:48.740
THEY SENT ME TO MY ROOM.

36:48.774 --> 36:51.577
NO. NO, THIS IS NOT GOOD.

36:51.610 --> 36:52.978
I'LL GET OUT SOMEHOW.
WHERE'S HANNA?

36:53.011 --> 36:55.814
ON HER WAY, I HOPE.

37:06.825 --> 37:08.460
( cellphone plinks )

37:32.884 --> 37:35.621
( Byron, Ella
talking in distance )

37:42.528 --> 37:45.030
ARE YOU GOING TO SEE HIM?
NO.

37:46.765 --> 37:49.735
BUT I HAVE TO GET OUT.

37:51.803 --> 37:54.039
YOU BETTER GO THIS WAY.

38:07.386 --> 38:09.521
THERE'S HANDHOLDS.

38:09.555 --> 38:11.957
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DROP
THE LAST FOUR FEET,
THOUGH.

38:11.990 --> 38:15.060
IS THIS HOW YOU
SNEAK OUT OF THE HOUSE?

38:15.093 --> 38:17.596
IT'S BEEN MY ESCAPE ROUTE
FOR YEARS.

38:19.097 --> 38:22.634
LOOK, MIKE,
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH ME AND EZRA,

38:22.668 --> 38:24.536
IT'S REALLY--
STOP.

38:24.570 --> 38:28.407
LOOK, I'M SORRY
I HIT HIM.

38:28.440 --> 38:32.511
BUT WHEN I SAW DAD'S FACE,
I FIGURED BETTER I DO IT
THAN HIM.

38:58.036 --> 39:00.472
I KNEW YOU'D BE HERE.

39:01.773 --> 39:03.442
I KNEW I COULD
DEPEND ON YOU.

39:08.179 --> 39:10.549
YOU LISTEN TO US.

39:10.582 --> 39:12.718
YOU'RE ALWAYS LISTENING.

39:15.987 --> 39:18.724
YOU KNOW YOU MADE
A MISTAKE, DON'T YOU?

39:23.595 --> 39:25.997
IT MUST BE
DRIVING YOU CRAZY.

39:28.934 --> 39:31.102
YOU'RE AFRAID
WE FOUND SOMETHING,

39:31.136 --> 39:34.506
SOMETHING IN THIS BOX.

39:34.540 --> 39:36.608
SOMETHING ABOUT YOU.

39:39.110 --> 39:42.881
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT WE FOUND?

39:42.914 --> 39:46.051
DO YOU WANT TO SEE
WHAT YOU'RE AFRAID OF?

39:55.126 --> 39:57.195
NOTHING.

39:57.228 --> 39:59.064
WE FOUND NOTHING.

40:00.632 --> 40:03.969
WE LIED TO YOU,
AND YOU BELIEVED US.

40:04.002 --> 40:05.671
THAT WAS YOUR MISTAKE.

40:12.177 --> 40:15.080
( Emily whimpering,
shouting )

40:16.515 --> 40:18.049
AAAAH!

40:31.963 --> 40:34.132
NO! NO!

40:34.165 --> 40:35.801
EMILY!

40:56.555 --> 40:59.625
ARE YOU OKAY?
( shouting )

41:08.033 --> 41:09.968
YOU GUYS, COME ON!

41:10.001 --> 41:11.937
HANNA!

41:53.912 --> 41:56.915
MY GOD,
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS!

41:56.948 --> 41:59.718
HEY. YOU OKAY?
YEAH, I THINK SO.

41:59.751 --> 42:02.821
DID I JUST HIT
WHAT I THINK I DID?
YES!

42:02.854 --> 42:07.025
AND NOW THEY'RE GONE!
WE'VE GOT NOTHING!

42:07.058 --> 42:08.526
WE'VE GOT NOTHING!

42:12.330 --> 42:14.800
WAS IT GARRETT
OR JENNA?
HOW COULD IT BE JENNA?

42:14.833 --> 42:17.335
I COULDN'T TELL.
WELL, WAS IT
A BOY OR A GIRL?

42:17.368 --> 42:19.304
I DON'T KNOW!
ANY SENSE OF BOOBS?

42:19.337 --> 42:21.640
HANNA.
WHAT?
IT COULD BE A CLUE.

42:29.748 --> 42:31.116
THAT'S NOT MINE.

42:31.149 --> 42:32.818
IT'S NOT MINE.

42:34.285 --> 42:36.554
IT'S NONE OF OURS.

42:39.958 --> 42:41.727
DO YOU THINK WHEN "A"
BOUNCED OFF THE CAR...

42:41.760 --> 42:44.696
THAT'S "A"'s CELLPHONE.
