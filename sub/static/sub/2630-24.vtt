00:02.001 --> 00:03.877
Previously on Friends:

00:04.086 --> 00:06.296
Don't come out here.

00:06.506 --> 00:09.717
- I ran into Richard.
- Which Richard?

00:09.926 --> 00:11.176
My ex-boyfriend.

00:11.386 --> 00:13.721
This is the worst thing
that could happen.

00:13.930 --> 00:18.017
You decided to tell him
about the Richard thing.

00:19.185 --> 00:21.311
Oh, no.

00:21.521 --> 00:24.440
- You can't see him.
- You can't tell me what to do.

00:24.649 --> 00:27.484
That's funny, I think I just did.

00:27.694 --> 00:31.739
- I have found my identical hand twin.
- What's that?

00:31.948 --> 00:36.744
A guy with my identical hands.
I'm gonna be a millionaire!

00:43.668 --> 00:46.670
You thought
I wanted to have sex with you?

00:46.838 --> 00:48.255
No.

00:49.340 --> 00:51.717
Last night was embarrassing
for you too.

00:51.926 --> 00:54.636
I just don't embarrass that easily.

01:02.979 --> 01:05.606
- I think the check-in is that way.
- Ah.

01:08.735 --> 01:09.943
Hello.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.282
Ah, kids love me.

01:15.575 --> 01:18.577
Hey! Hi. You guys are here!

01:18.745 --> 01:22.206
Yay! What'd you do?
Did you go to a costume party?

01:23.083 --> 01:25.501
Let me guess. Um, Pancho Villa.

01:27.587 --> 01:29.463
And you're Bob Saget.

01:31.800 --> 01:32.883
Pancho Villa?

01:34.844 --> 01:36.845
What are you talking about, Pheebs?
I don't...

01:40.975 --> 01:43.644
Oh, my God! You drew on me?

01:43.853 --> 01:45.938
Hey, you wet my pants!

01:46.856 --> 01:48.607
Whoa, what kind of party was this?

01:49.651 --> 01:53.320
I've been walking around like this?
You have so crossed a line.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.824
Rach, wait.
The men's room is that way.

02:01.579 --> 02:03.205
- Oh!
- What?

02:03.414 --> 02:06.875
It's the third time she's won
on a machine I was playing.

02:07.043 --> 02:09.627
Oh. I bet she's one of those people.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.548
Mole people?

02:13.424 --> 02:14.800
What? No, a lurker.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.677
Oh. What's that?

02:16.845 --> 02:19.555
When you're playing a machine
and it hasn't paid out...

02:19.806 --> 02:22.224
...a lurker waits for you
to give up and then...

02:22.392 --> 02:23.433
Kills you?

02:25.019 --> 02:28.230
No, they swoop in and steal your jackpot.

02:29.065 --> 02:30.149
- Oh.
- Mm-hm.

02:30.358 --> 02:33.485
- How do you know about this?
- My nana used to do it.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.780
That's how she paid for my dance...
Karate lessons.

02:37.699 --> 02:39.074
Dance karate?

02:39.284 --> 02:41.827
Yes, it's a deadly...

02:42.036 --> 02:43.912
...but beautiful sport.

02:47.917 --> 02:49.960
- It won't come off.
- What?

02:50.211 --> 02:51.336
It won't come off.

02:51.546 --> 02:53.755
Oh, my God. Rach, are you sure?

02:53.965 --> 02:56.383
I took it off,
and then I drew it back on.

02:57.969 --> 02:59.636
Hey! You made it!

03:02.682 --> 03:04.099
Who's your friend? He's hot.

03:05.894 --> 03:06.935
Thanks, man.

03:07.103 --> 03:11.148
Listen, I talked to Chandler,
and I'm sorry about the movie.

03:11.357 --> 03:12.399
Don't be sorry.

03:12.609 --> 03:15.986
I don't need it anymore.
I found my identical hand twin.

03:16.654 --> 03:17.696
Your what?

03:17.906 --> 03:21.408
My identical hand twin.
The person whose hands are like mine.

03:21.618 --> 03:22.951
This is a gold mine.

03:23.161 --> 03:24.411
What?

03:25.997 --> 03:28.081
That won't make you any money.

03:28.291 --> 03:29.625
Well, fine.

03:29.876 --> 03:33.253
None of you will live with me
in my hand-shaped mansion.

03:35.173 --> 03:37.549
Except, uh, you.
You can live in the thumb.

04:18.548 --> 04:20.550
All right, baby, come on!

04:20.718 --> 04:21.927
Yes! Yes!

04:22.095 --> 04:24.513
- I am on fire!
- See you later.

04:25.223 --> 04:26.682
What are you doing?

04:26.891 --> 04:28.558
What's it look like? Going home.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.269
Why?

04:30.812 --> 04:32.271
Chandler.

04:32.480 --> 04:33.730
Chandler, wait.

04:34.190 --> 04:36.817
Sorry, I was just playing
for one second.

04:37.026 --> 04:40.362
If you don't want me to see
Richard again, I won't.

04:40.571 --> 04:42.239
He means nothing to me.

04:42.448 --> 04:44.741
Oh, come on. I was there.

04:47.495 --> 04:49.288
I know he's the love of your life.

04:50.581 --> 04:51.873
Not anymore.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.209
Really?

04:55.169 --> 04:56.837
Really.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.425
All right?

05:01.634 --> 05:05.429
Let's forget about going home
and celebrate our anniversary.

05:07.181 --> 05:08.682
Okay, this is empty.

05:10.059 --> 05:12.853
I wanted to make a dramatic scene,
but I hate packing.

05:17.358 --> 05:18.608
Where's the other guy?

05:19.027 --> 05:20.319
Which guy?

05:20.528 --> 05:23.196
Tall, dark hair, hand looks
exactly like this?

05:23.990 --> 05:27.492
I don't know about the hands,
but he went to the restroom.

05:27.702 --> 05:29.161
Okay.

05:34.250 --> 05:37.836
- How you doing?
- Very busy.

05:38.046 --> 05:39.588
Right. Okay.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.178
Yes, hello. I have a question.

05:46.346 --> 05:51.558
Um, I used your pen to draw
on my friend's face.

05:52.393 --> 05:54.478
A beard and a mustache.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.358
Thank you.

06:00.526 --> 06:02.694
No, she didn't think so.

06:02.904 --> 06:04.905
I know. It's like... Anyway...

06:06.532 --> 06:10.702
Makeup didn't cover it. We've tried
everything, and nothing's worked.

06:10.953 --> 06:12.788
What do we do?

06:13.623 --> 06:15.624
Yeah. Uh-huh.

06:16.167 --> 06:19.252
Yeah. Oh, okay.

06:19.462 --> 06:21.296
Okay, thank you.

06:21.506 --> 06:23.382
Yeah, it's not coming off.

06:24.300 --> 06:26.134
What? What else did he say?

06:26.344 --> 06:29.596
Um, he said he thought I was funny.

06:31.599 --> 06:34.643
Okay, look. Let's just go downstairs...

06:34.852 --> 06:38.230
...we'll have some fun,
and you will forget all about it.

06:38.439 --> 06:41.525
There's no way I am leaving
looking like this!

06:41.734 --> 06:43.819
Come on, Rach. It's not that bad.

06:44.070 --> 06:46.071
Ross, I am a human doodle!

06:47.532 --> 06:51.785
Just because some idiot drew on your
face doesn't mean you can't have fun.

06:52.036 --> 06:54.246
Besides, no one will even look at you.

06:54.455 --> 06:58.291
This is Vegas. Hello?
There are tons of other freaks here.

06:59.794 --> 07:04.881
There are tons of freaks here.
No other. No.

07:05.133 --> 07:07.843
Come on. No one will notice. I swear.

07:15.017 --> 07:17.727
There was some staring and pointing.

07:19.689 --> 07:20.939
I need a drink.

07:21.649 --> 07:24.317
They really overcharge you
for that stuff.

07:26.195 --> 07:29.114
But who cares,
because it's all on me.

07:33.744 --> 07:36.288
That is one big drink.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.498
Macadamia nut?

07:38.666 --> 07:42.169
Um, wow! That's some pricey nut.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.798
Really like those macadamia nuts, huh?

07:47.300 --> 07:49.009
Nope.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.522
Get out of here, you lurker!

08:02.773 --> 08:04.065
Go on, get!

08:06.110 --> 08:08.945
- Hey, Pheebs.
- You made up.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.698
I couldn't be mad at him for too long.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.909
She couldn't live
without the "Chand love."

08:16.537 --> 08:17.954
Aw.

08:18.122 --> 08:20.290
Get a room.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.459
- We have one.
- I know. Use it.

08:26.297 --> 08:27.672
Oh, yeah.

08:29.258 --> 08:31.968
That's right.
Take good care of those babies.

08:32.595 --> 08:34.804
- Excuse me?
- It's me. Joey.

08:35.014 --> 08:37.307
Do I know you?

08:37.517 --> 08:38.892
Joey?

08:40.269 --> 08:42.229
Oh, yeah.

08:42.438 --> 08:44.731
Yeah, the hand guy.

08:44.941 --> 08:48.276
So, what are we gonna do
about this hand twin thing?

08:49.487 --> 08:50.737
Nothing.

08:51.697 --> 08:54.783
Look, you and I have been given a gift.

08:54.992 --> 08:58.912
We have to do something with it.
Like hand modeling. Or magic.

08:59.121 --> 09:01.873
And you know NASA's
gonna want to talk to us.

09:03.501 --> 09:05.377
- I have to get back to work.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:05.878 --> 09:07.462
We can have our own show.

09:07.672 --> 09:10.882
We can clap our hands together.
People will love it!

09:11.759 --> 09:12.801
Huh?

09:12.969 --> 09:14.886
And I wrote a song for us.

09:15.137 --> 09:17.681
This hand is your hand

09:18.808 --> 09:21.226
This hand is my hand

09:21.727 --> 09:24.020
Oh, wait, that's your hand

09:25.982 --> 09:28.400
No, wait, it's my hand

09:30.861 --> 09:34.573
- That's okay.
- But you haven't even heard the chorus!

09:37.034 --> 09:38.285
Oh, my God.

09:38.703 --> 09:41.162
I look like my great-aunt, Muriel.

09:41.956 --> 09:43.415
All right, you know what?

09:43.624 --> 09:45.750
We don't have to go downstairs.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.587
We can bring Vegas up to us.

09:48.796 --> 09:50.046
All right, come on.

09:50.298 --> 09:52.924
We'll play some blackjack.
Here we go.

09:53.634 --> 09:55.218
- Thirteen.
- Hit me.

09:55.469 --> 09:57.429
Ooh, 23.

09:58.848 --> 10:02.517
Which is what we play to
at this casino!

10:04.186 --> 10:05.770
You win $10!

10:05.980 --> 10:08.148
- I bet 20.
- Right.

10:13.362 --> 10:16.281
A new pair of shoes
for the Chan-Chan man!

10:17.283 --> 10:18.867
Yes!

10:19.035 --> 10:20.869
I've never seen a roll like this!

10:21.078 --> 10:22.329
That's right, baby!

10:22.538 --> 10:23.872
What do I want now?

10:25.666 --> 10:28.168
Eight? Uh, six.

10:28.419 --> 10:31.296
Pick a number!
That is your only job.

10:31.505 --> 10:32.756
- Eight.
- Thank you.

10:32.965 --> 10:35.800
If you get this,
we buy everybody a steak dinner.

10:39.096 --> 10:40.555
- Eight it is.
- Yes!

10:41.807 --> 10:43.808
We're not buying steak dinners, are we?

10:44.018 --> 10:45.685
- No.
- Okay, good.

10:47.021 --> 10:49.230
- What do I want now?
- Try a hard eight.

10:49.440 --> 10:50.940
- What?
- Two fours.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.069
Eight!

10:54.654 --> 10:57.656
Don't you let her go.
You're a lucky guy.

10:57.865 --> 11:00.075
Thank you, Mr. Drunken Gambler.

11:00.910 --> 11:04.412
You get this, and, uh, we get
the biggest suite in the place.

11:08.250 --> 11:10.502
We get the biggest suite in the place.

11:10.711 --> 11:12.462
The biggest suite in the place!

11:12.672 --> 11:14.130
Come on!

11:15.675 --> 11:18.051
I love you!
I can't remember why we fought.

11:18.302 --> 11:20.220
Because I had lunch with Rich...

11:20.471 --> 11:21.763
Me neither!

11:22.473 --> 11:24.474
- What now?
- Uh, another hard eight.

11:24.725 --> 11:26.976
Hard eight? Let's call it easy eight!

11:27.228 --> 11:30.522
I'll tell you what.
You roll another hard eight...

11:31.232 --> 11:33.858
...and we get married here, tonight.

11:38.739 --> 11:40.323
Shut up!

11:42.785 --> 11:45.203
It just got interesting!

11:51.168 --> 11:52.460
What did you say?

11:52.837 --> 11:55.714
You roll another eight,
we get married tonight.

11:56.716 --> 11:59.676
- You serious?
- Yes. I love you.

11:59.885 --> 12:05.974
I've never loved anybody
as much as I love you.

12:06.434 --> 12:10.228
So if an eight comes up,
we take it as a sign and we do it.

12:10.479 --> 12:12.522
What do you say?

12:12.732 --> 12:13.940
- Okay.
- Okay.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.317
Hard eight.

12:20.114 --> 12:23.199
That's a four.
And where's the other one?

12:23.409 --> 12:26.619
- Under the table.
- Nobody move!

12:26.871 --> 12:29.414
You look that way, I look this way.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.294
Here it is, here it is.

12:36.046 --> 12:37.505
That could be 4 or 5.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.010
It's your call.

12:45.514 --> 12:47.223
It's a four.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.187
I think so too.

13:19.173 --> 13:21.633
Oh, well, lost again.

13:26.013 --> 13:28.348
That's it. You and me. Outside!

13:28.557 --> 13:32.101
I wouldn't want you to lose a chunk
of that pretty blond hair!

13:34.730 --> 13:36.189
Oh!

13:37.274 --> 13:38.525
Be cool.

13:42.321 --> 13:44.447
Okay, your lurking days are over.

13:44.657 --> 13:48.326
- What?
- Everyone you lurk, I'll lurk first.

13:48.577 --> 13:51.329
You move on,
I'll be one step ahead of you...

13:51.539 --> 13:52.789
...every single time.

13:52.998 --> 13:56.668
And then I'll be on your ass
every hour of every day...

13:56.877 --> 13:58.461
...till Monday...

13:58.754 --> 14:01.047
...because that's when I go home.

14:01.757 --> 14:04.467
- When do you leave?
- Also Monday.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.011
What time? Maybe we can share a cab.

14:09.390 --> 14:10.640
Hit me.

14:11.350 --> 14:22.110
Hit me.

14:22.903 --> 14:24.195
We need more cards.

14:25.823 --> 14:29.242
Yeah, and we also need more, um, drinks.
Hold on a second.

14:32.788 --> 14:34.414
Hello, Vegas?

14:36.166 --> 14:37.792
We would like more alcohol.

14:38.043 --> 14:40.962
You know what else?
We would like some more beers.

14:43.799 --> 14:46.092
Oh, I forgot to dial.

14:49.847 --> 14:52.849
That must be our alcohol and beers.

14:56.562 --> 14:59.898
- Hey.
- It's Joey! I love Joey!

15:00.107 --> 15:01.733
Oh, I love Joey!

15:01.942 --> 15:03.234
Joey lives with a duck.

15:05.946 --> 15:07.822
Look, I need some help, okay?

15:08.073 --> 15:11.200
Someone has to convince
my hand twin to cooperate.

15:11.410 --> 15:16.331
I'll do it. Whatever you need
me to do, I'm your man.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.002
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

15:21.211 --> 15:23.171
Are you okay?

15:25.799 --> 15:27.759
Yeah. Fine. Thanks.

15:30.888 --> 15:32.221
Hey, Rach?

15:32.473 --> 15:34.307
How you doing?

15:36.936 --> 15:39.687
I'm doing good, baby.
How you doing?

15:41.523 --> 15:43.358
Don't let her drink anymore.

15:47.237 --> 15:51.032
Here's that macadamia nut.

15:53.118 --> 15:54.953
- No, something else.
- Oops.

16:00.834 --> 16:02.710
So, what do you wanna do now?

16:02.920 --> 16:05.129
I wanna get out of the room.

16:06.882 --> 16:10.051
I really miss downstairs.

16:10.803 --> 16:15.348
Okay, you know what? There is only
one way I am leaving this hotel room.

16:17.267 --> 16:18.893
Well, hello!

16:20.104 --> 16:21.854
I'm Ross.

16:22.314 --> 16:25.692
- Good luck to you.
- Sir, you've got a little something...

16:31.490 --> 16:33.700
- Hello.
- Hello.

17:01.812 --> 17:04.689
I won! I won! I finally won!

17:04.897 --> 17:06.648
I won! That was my quarter!

17:06.858 --> 17:08.984
Take a hike, toots.

17:10.487 --> 17:11.904
Excuse me, sir.

17:12.114 --> 17:14.781
This lady played my quarter.
This is my money.

17:14.992 --> 17:16.284
Is that true, miss?

17:17.786 --> 17:20.663
- Sells drugs to kids.
- What?

17:21.665 --> 17:23.540
She sells drugs to kids.

17:24.917 --> 17:26.877
It was my quarter.

17:27.087 --> 17:28.337
Was it her quarter?

17:29.048 --> 17:31.758
How about we talk
about this over dinner?

17:31.967 --> 17:35.720
- Okay, lady, you're out of here.
- No, you can't arrest me!

17:35.929 --> 17:38.014
I won't go back to that hellhole!

17:39.767 --> 17:42.268
I'm just taking you outside.

17:42.478 --> 17:43.978
Oh, okay.

17:48.025 --> 17:52.945
I need something old, something new,
something borrowed and something blue.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.365
Here's something blue and new.

17:56.575 --> 17:59.035
You are so efficient. I love you.

17:59.453 --> 18:00.703
- Let's go.
- No, wait!

18:00.954 --> 18:02.455
We need something old.

18:02.664 --> 18:06.501
I have a condom in my wallet
that I've had since I was 12.

18:08.420 --> 18:10.046
That'll work.

18:10.255 --> 18:11.923
I don't think so.

18:13.467 --> 18:15.593
Now something borrowed.

18:16.512 --> 18:20.098
- Here, just take this.
- That's stealing.

18:20.641 --> 18:22.850
We'll bring it back.
Put it under your dress.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.401
Aw.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.489
Okay. One thing at a time.

18:48.919 --> 18:52.380
- Are you gonna play?
- No, I don't really have any money.

18:53.507 --> 18:56.175
Not yet, anyway.

18:57.678 --> 18:59.387
Can't sit here if you don't play.

19:13.777 --> 19:17.530
Hello. My name is Regina Phalange.

19:19.366 --> 19:22.034
I'm a businesswoman
in town on business.

19:22.244 --> 19:24.036
Would you like to see my card?

19:24.246 --> 19:25.997
What did I do with my Filofax?

19:26.248 --> 19:28.457
I must've left it
in Conference Room B.

19:29.585 --> 19:31.586
- Fourteen.
- Hit me.

19:32.045 --> 19:37.633
Oh, my God. May I just say that you
gentlemen have the exact same hands?

19:39.178 --> 19:40.511
They're identical.

19:40.721 --> 19:43.431
I've never seen that
in the business world.

19:45.100 --> 19:46.809
Stop it.

19:47.728 --> 19:52.565
Miss Phalange, may I ask you a question
as an impartial person at this table?

19:52.774 --> 19:54.317
Please stop it.

19:56.153 --> 19:59.155
Wouldn't you pay good money
to see identical hands...

19:59.406 --> 20:03.784
...showcased in some type
of an entertainment venue?

20:03.994 --> 20:07.872
If you leave now, I will chop off
my hand and give it to you!

20:10.876 --> 20:12.627
Didn't I just throw you out?

20:13.128 --> 20:14.962
No, you threw out Phoebe.

20:15.214 --> 20:18.007
I'm Regina Phalange. Phalange.

20:18.592 --> 20:20.384
Come on, lady.

20:20.594 --> 20:21.928
Please take him too.

20:22.137 --> 20:24.805
Me? Oh, come on, man.

20:25.015 --> 20:26.265
Come on, buddy.

20:27.142 --> 20:29.393
Don't let him do this. Come on!

20:29.645 --> 20:32.271
I'm your hand twin!

20:36.526 --> 20:38.736
Hello. One marriage, please.

20:38.987 --> 20:40.404
We want to get married.

20:40.614 --> 20:43.282
There's a service in progress.
Have a seat.

20:43.784 --> 20:45.117
All right.

20:54.002 --> 20:55.253
What are you doing?

20:55.504 --> 20:58.005
The "Wedding March."
Does that freak you out?

20:58.215 --> 21:00.091
No, it's the graduation song.

21:04.763 --> 21:06.222
Okay.

21:06.431 --> 21:09.267
This is it. We're gonna get married.

21:09.476 --> 21:11.060
You sure you wanna do this?

21:16.733 --> 21:18.985
Hello, Mrs. Ross!

21:19.236 --> 21:22.321
Well, hello, Mr. Rachel!

21:24.491 --> 21:26.284
Wait. Okay.
