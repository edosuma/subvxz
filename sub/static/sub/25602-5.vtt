That's not a disease.
It's more like an explosmn.

Look, the kid has two kinds of cells,
a normal human one and a Hullen one.

06:56.560 --> 06:57.948
Now, the human degrades
like normal...

06:58.040 --> 06:59.701
But the Hullen one sees
any degradation

06:59.800 --> 07:00.937
as something it needs to fix,

07:01.040 --> 07:03.497
so it forces the human cell
to regenerate faster.

The older he gets.

10:39.200 --> 10:43.660
Uh, question, what do we have in the
way of sustenance and/or beverages

10:43.760 --> 10:45.819
for a rather hungry young lad?

10:48.840 --> 10:50.228
I'll root around.

10:50.520 --> 10:51.782
You guys carry on.

10:52.960 --> 10:54.587
Alternatives. What do we need?

10:54.680 --> 10:56.545
An expert in aggressive
disease processes.

10:56.840 --> 10:57.829
If I didn't know
his background,

10:57.920 --> 10:59.581
I'd say that he was
closed with a bio weapon,

10:59.720 --> 11:01.460
something that attacks
on the cellular level.

11:01.560 --> 11:04.120
Um, hi. Excuse me.

11:04.200 --> 11:07.260
Do you seriously have no
drinks that aren't alcoholic,

11:07.360 --> 11:10.181
or have y'all just been drunk
the entire time I've known you?

11:14.400 --> 11:15.537
Moving on,

11:15.840 --> 11:18.183
you said you need someone
with bio weapons experience.

11:19.040 --> 11:21.099
I can help.
You? How?

11:21.240 --> 11:24.027
Well, as you may remember, before
I became the freedom fighter

11:24.160 --> 11:25.741
you see standing
before you today,

11:25.840 --> 11:29.503
I did happen to run with some
rather unsavory characters.

11:29.600 --> 11:30.624
Shocker.

11:30.720 --> 11:32.301
Whoever it is,
we can't go back to Westerley.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.662
Oh, he's not on Westerley.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.639
Have you ever heard of
a place called Utopia?

11:40.520 --> 11:42.147
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

11:51.920 --> 11:54.900
PIPPIN: Criminal geniuses, total
reprobates, sexual deviants...

11:55.400 --> 11:56.469
My people.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.382
This Kravn is
one of your people?

11:59.480 --> 12:01.664
Well, as much as the maker of
hideous gene-warping weapons

12:01.760 --> 12:02.977
is my people, yeah.

12:03.080 --> 12:05.583
But don't worry. He loves me.

12:05.800 --> 12:08.109
Well, just in case
his love has waned...

12:09.400 --> 12:11.300
And I know how much is there.

12:16.880 --> 12:19.223
JOHN: Ooh, this one was
speaking to me.

12:19.320 --> 12:22.141
It said, "Shoot me, Johnny.
Shoot me all you want."

12:22.560 --> 12:24.903
Hey. You usually
like my gun talk.

12:25.200 --> 12:28.624
Sorry, it's just hard to think about
anything but that damn story.

12:29.640 --> 12:30.823
Hey, what about Big Joe?

12:30.920 --> 12:32.626
He was the reason_
we took our first mISSIon.

12:32.840 --> 12:34.785
I just remember how pissed
he was when I shot him.

12:35.480 --> 12:36.663
When you did?

12:37.040 --> 12:38.257
Johnny, do you
remember anything

12:38.400 --> 12:39.537
the way it actually happened?
Why?

12:39.640 --> 12:42.302
My version is way more
interesting.

12:46.960 --> 12:51.021
"Stimu-gain, for that
extra bit of aggression."

12:52.440 --> 12:54.624
Guessing you don't need
that, huh, big fella?

12:55.080 --> 12:58.664
And I love that geno-bomb
that he dropped on Thalimoid.

12:58.760 --> 13:01.183
Very 9000)-

13:01.280 --> 13:02.622
But, as I said,

13:02.760 --> 13:04.944
this case that we need
Kravn to consult on,

13:05.040 --> 13:07.747
it is time-sensitive,
so just mention Pippin.

13:07.840 --> 13:09.979
Pippin Foster is here
to see him. We go way back.

13:10.240 --> 13:11.628
Mr.
Kra vn?
KRA l/lll: (O/V
INTERCOM) What did I tell you

13:11.720 --> 13:13.540
about bothering me
wh/le I ’m working,

13:13.680 --> 13:15.147
you ma/oo'orous fungus?

13:15.320 --> 13:16.981
A thousand apologies,
Mr. Kravn,

13:17.080 --> 13:20.664
but do you happen to know
one Pippin Foster?

13:20.840 --> 13:24.719
Brown hair, thin l/ps, face
you want to punch repeated/y?

13:24.800 --> 13:27.746
Hey, now, Kravn, Krave-man.

13:28.080 --> 13:30.025
Never hearo’ of him.
Now piss oﬁf

13:30.160 --> 13:32.424
If I don ’t deliver these
blood busters by next cycle,

13:32.520 --> 13:34.499
it’s your balls, io’iot.

13:34.640 --> 13:36.699
Unfortunately, Mr. Kravn
isn't here at the moment.

13:36.800 --> 13:38.540
He sure sounds here.
Maybe we should just go back

13:38.640 --> 13:40.619
and check ourselves?
Have you met Branson?

13:40.720 --> 13:43.382
Hey, hey, hey,
come on, now, guys.

13:44.280 --> 13:46.419
We are just a couple
shady individuals

13:46.520 --> 13:48.420
looking to hire an illegal
bioweapons maker.

13:48.520 --> 13:50.738
There's no need to
make it weird.

13:50.840 --> 13:54.424
Besides, there is
more than enough

13:55.960 --> 13:57.279
to go around.

14:00.960 --> 14:04.305
Exciting news, Mr. Kravn has
an opening in his schedule.

14:04.400 --> 14:05.901
Ah.
How does...

14:07.680 --> 14:09.420
Three months' time sound?

14:12.360 --> 14:14.180
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

14:14.520 --> 14:15.839
Look, I know other folks.

14:16.160 --> 14:18.424
No time. If he'S the best,
he's the one we need.

14:18.720 --> 14:20.187
Did you give him the bribe?
PIPPIN: Yeah.

14:20.280 --> 14:22.259
And can I just say that
as a very experienced

14:22.360 --> 14:25.227
bribe giver and getter, what
that guy did was not cool?

14:25.600 --> 14:26.783
Got it?

14:28.000 --> 14:29.501
Security setup?
Like you figured,

14:29.600 --> 14:32.103
silent alarm switch on the desk,
biggish guy with an attitude.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.839
Plus, a safe room that locks 30
seconds after the alarm is tripped.

14:36.240 --> 14:37.559
Awesome!

14:37.880 --> 14:39.905
How do we know all that?
You.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.900
JOHN: Perimeter scanner embedded
in the money
clip
we gave you-

14:43.000 --> 14:45.457
It gave us the entire floor
plan for Kravn Enterprises.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.457
Oh, God.

14:48.040 --> 14:50.019
Oh, God, no, no, no.

14:50.120 --> 14:53.419
Do you know what that lunatic
makes inside of his labs?

14:53.520 --> 14:56.705
If you try to rip him off, you will
be shitting out your own lungs

14:56.800 --> 14:58.062
while your eyeballs melt.

14:58.160 --> 15:00.219
Pippin, relax, we're not
gonna rip him off.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.181
We're just gonna kidnap him.

15:08.640 --> 15:11.700
Just remember the only reason
you're on walkabout right now,

15:11.800 --> 15:14.701
I need someone to show me_ where
you assholes store the go jU|ce.

15:14.800 --> 15:16.939
You make any sudden moves,
I get shooty.

15:18.600 --> 15:20.500
So, you got a name at least?

15:21.960 --> 15:24.667
My mind-reading's on the fritz,
Tall, Weird, and Silent. Speak up.

15:24.760 --> 15:25.943
Something is wrong.

15:26.360 --> 15:27.497
Well, no Shit.

15:27.600 --> 15:28.669
But you're gonna
help me fix it.

15:28.960 --> 15:31.520
Something is wrong! Pick
another catchphrase, buddy.

15:31.600 --> 15:33.500
Just show me
where the green Shit is.

15:37.360 --> 15:38.702
Where's she keep
the plasma?

15:38.800 --> 15:41.940
Through a hallway filled with her
zombified meat puppets, of course.

15:46.680 --> 15:47.704
Something is wrong.

15:47.840 --> 15:49.159
I could've sworn
these assholes

15:49.240 --> 15:51.344
were facing the other way
when we put them here.

15:52.320 --> 15:53.423
Let's go.

15:56.720 --> 16:00.269
Untraceable weapons,
micro-torch, and a mask.

16:00.600 --> 16:03.421
Can I just say again
masks make me look goofy?

16:03.520 --> 16:06.626
Can I just say again how
incredibly bad of an idea this is?

16:06.880 --> 16:08.859
What are you talking about?
This is a great idea.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.581
0’ av enters Kra vn‘e
storefront...

16:10.840 --> 16:12.944
D'AVIN: Hands up!
Everybody down!

16:13.080 --> 16:14.263
This is a robbery!

16:15.760 --> 16:16.977
DUTCH: With a mask, Dav.

16:17.200 --> 16:18.383
054 VI/\/.' Fine, with
a
mask

16:18.480 --> 16:20.664
Hands up! Everybody down!

16:21.080 --> 16:22.217
This is a robbery!

16:23.480 --> 16:26.426
DUTCH:
Which W/l/ lead one of those
assholes to hit the 5/lent alarm,

16:26.600 --> 16:29.660
leading Mr. Kra vn to go to his safe
room, where we W/l/ be waiting for him.

16:29.800 --> 16:33.429
JOH/V: At which point; we grab him for
some sweet sweet scienh'ﬁc solutions.

16:35.280 --> 16:38.260
All you have to do iS stand
lookout outside the shop.

16:39.320 --> 16:40.708
Okay-

16:40.920 --> 16:42.865
My nickname iS "the Mouth."

16:42.960 --> 16:45.781
It's not "the Eyes,"
it's not "the Ears,"

16:45.880 --> 16:48.144
or any other part of our
bodies that's gonna fall off

16:48.240 --> 16:49.821
once Kravn doses us

16:49.920 --> 16:52.423
with whatever nasty shit
he's got in those vials!

16:52.520 --> 16:54.260
Pippin! Calm down!

16:54.640 --> 16:56.585
Listen, if you're worried,
you can go back.

16:56.680 --> 16:58.466
Bye. Good luck not dying.

17:01.480 --> 17:02.799
Excuse me, pardon me.

17:04.360 --> 17:05.577
Well, cheers.

17:07.320 --> 17:10.300
You know me, Gared. I'm an honest gal.
Never messed with nobody.

17:10.480 --> 17:11.981
I know, Ginny, I know.

17:12.200 --> 17:14.179
When Suzy died,
it was just me and the kid.

17:14.280 --> 17:15.417
I never took on no debts.

17:15.520 --> 17:17.181
Always paid my Way-

17:17.560 --> 17:19.300
Why'd a Howler
come take my kid?

17:19.400 --> 17:21.186
It ain't a Howler,
Ginny, come on.

17:21.560 --> 17:23.903
A what?
Old miner's superstition.

17:24.520 --> 17:28.183
"The debt'S too high, Howlers arrive.
Children beware, they'll eat your liver."

17:28.280 --> 17:29.269
(BOTH SPIT)

17:30.080 --> 17:31.104
That doesn't rhyme.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.189
I don't write
the legends, bro.

17:32.400 --> 17:34.982
And I saw what I saw.
Red eyes, just like a Howler.

17:35.080 --> 17:36.707
And it did magic on me. Look.

17:39.320 --> 17:40.901
Short-range energy weapon.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.262
Didn't feel like
no energy weapon.

17:42.600 --> 17:43.862
You get shot a lot?

17:46.040 --> 17:47.064
I don't like him.

17:48.320 --> 17:49.582
We're just trying to help,
Ginny.

17:49.680 --> 17:51.739
You want to help? Find my baby girl.
Can you do that?

17:55.520 --> 17:56.908
Hey, there's nothing there.

18:02.200 --> 18:03.986
That sure
looks like something.

18:06.280 --> 18:09.067
And forget about
after-work chitchat.

18:09.520 --> 18:10.589
"Oh, what did you do
today,honey?"

18:10.680 --> 18:13.467
"Well, I sold a drug that
melts people's testicles.

18:13.720 --> 18:14.857
"What's for dinner?"
(CHUCKLES)

18:14.960 --> 18:16.097
Branson, baby,
you understand...

18:16.240 --> 18:18.504
D'AVIN: Hands up!
Stay still! Don't move!

18:18.760 --> 18:19.749
What the hells is this?

18:19.840 --> 18:21.023
It's a stickup, asshole.

18:22.480 --> 18:24.061
Start filling it with
everything shiny.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.265
Hey, Stringbean, sit tight.

18:36.320 --> 18:37.787
Dutch, alarm's a go.

18:38.280 --> 18:40.419
Copy, almost there.

18:41.840 --> 18:43.159
Everything.

18:44.840 --> 18:48.059
You know, it's too bad we can't
ask Big Joe about that mission.

18:48.880 --> 18:50.984
Yeah, what with him
being dead and all.

18:52.400 --> 18:55.460
Yeah, there's also Hills.
Also dead.

18:56.120 --> 18:58.145
You ever notice a lot of
people seem to die around us?

18:58.280 --> 18:59.542
Yeah.

19:00.120 --> 19:01.587
It's part of our charm.

19:16.960 --> 19:19.303
D'av, we're in.
Come to mama.

19:19.400 --> 19:21.186
054 Will: He should
be there any second.

19:25.200 --> 19:28.419
Hey, hey, hey, picked up
some scented bubble bath.

19:28.880 --> 19:30.347
You can have some, too,
if you.

19:30.480 --> 19:32.539
What's going on?
Is everything okay?

19:32.640 --> 19:33.982
Does it look okay?
He's burning through nutrients

19:34.080 --> 19:35.263
faster than I can
get them In hIm.

19:35.400 --> 19:36.788
Get me electrolytes.

19:38.080 --> 19:41.379
Okay, little buddy, time to
drink up for Uncle Pip, okay?

19:41.480 --> 19:43.664
(SCREAMING)

19:44.920 --> 19:46.820
All right, that is
definitely not okay.

19:49.600 --> 19:50.988
Any second...

19:54.920 --> 19:57.024
Where iS he?
Did the alarms go off?

19:57.120 --> 19:58.257
KRP/V/VC Certain/y did.

19:58.360 --> 20:00.225
I can barely
hear myself think.

20:01.640 --> 20:03.699
So, thieves, are you?

20:03.800 --> 20:06.257
No, I ’m th/nk/ng more...

20:06.360 --> 20:08.863
Look at you,
not to mention smell you.

20:08.960 --> 20:11.269
Everything about you
says desperate.

20:11.360 --> 20:13.021
Not my preferred clientele.

20:13.200 --> 20:14.383
What are you looking for?

20:14.520 --> 20:16.385
Cameras? Microphones?

20:16.480 --> 20:18.698
I 7/ give you a hint.
You won ’t find any.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.984
I don ’t need them,
not anymore.

20:21.160 --> 20:24.425
What the shit is this, Johnny? How
can he be in this room? Where is he?

20:26.120 --> 20:28.304
Dutch, I don't think
he's in the safe room,

20:28.400 --> 20:30.220
I think he is the safe room.

20:36.720 --> 20:38.620
DUTCH: What do you mean,
he is the safe room?

20:38.720 --> 20:40.221
What, Kravn's an Al?

20:40.320 --> 20:44.199
Mainframe has a sentience complexity
way beyond an Al. It's like...

20:44.520 --> 20:47.182
Someone uploaded a human
consciousness into the system.

20:47.280 --> 20:48.986
KRA V/V’. /Vot l/ke, boy, did/

20:49.080 --> 20:53.028
In 30 years of studying disease,
I ’ve learned not to trust flesh.

20:53.120 --> 20:56.999
Flesh is weak. In here,
I am an undying god.

20:57.560 --> 20:58.743
Also crazy.

20:58.840 --> 21:00.785
You are just so much
ﬂesh to play with.

21:00.880 --> 21:03.667
And I ’ve been needing
some new test subjects.

21:03.760 --> 21:04.829
Gas.

21:05.080 --> 21:08.026
Smells like Temin,
nerve agent, invisible.

21:08.360 --> 21:10.863
KRA l/lll: She knows her sedatives,
which means she also knows

21:10.960 --> 21:12.507
how long you have
to stay conscious.

21:12.600 --> 21:14.704
Uh... What's that
on the desk there?

21:15.400 --> 21:16.389
Pens?

21:16.480 --> 21:18.380
Yeah, sure. Why not?
I'm always losing mine.

21:18.920 --> 21:21.104
Dutch, the hells is going on?

21:21.280 --> 21:22.497
(BOTH GRUNTING)

21:24.360 --> 21:25.748
(GROANS)

21:26.160 --> 21:27.741
Everybody has

some crazy undying woman to make you."

nuts, right?

Exactly.
But maybe that's what

29:42.040 --> 29:43.462

want to know where I came from.

needs to hear.

you always do.

I'm trying, Okay?
It's a very complex system.

32:55.440 --> 32:56.429
KRAVN: For you, maybe.

32:56.520 --> 32:58.101
Lucy, my s/licon siren,

32:58.200 --> 33:00.623
would you care to have access
to the entire Utopia mainframe

33:00.720 --> 33:02.347
through a charming
little back door I have?

33:02.600 --> 33:04.465
Now you tell us.
LUCY:
Thank
you, Mr. Kravn.

33:04.560 --> 33:06.061
Entering your back door now.

33:06.160 --> 33:08.299
Can we just not with the
back-door talk?

33:08.400 --> 33:10.300
LUCY: I found them.
KRA l/N: Look how fast she is.

33:10.400 --> 33:11.583
You are a wonder.

33:12.120 --> 33:15.226
LUCY: P/ppin just purchased two
tickets for a shuttle oﬁ‘ Utopia.

33:15.320 --> 33:16.981
It leaves in five minutes.

33:25.320 --> 33:26.742
Infrared lenses.

33:27.480 --> 33:29.141
That's how they read
his handprint.

33:33.920 --> 33:35.547
They're not taking
any more kids.

33:36.560 --> 33:38.744
Damn it, Gared!
Hey, Killjoy!

33:39.480 --> 33:40.742
(FANCY GROAN S)

33:42.240 --> 33:43.377
Hey, assholes!

33:43.480 --> 33:45.027
Try grabbing someone
your own size!

33:45.120 --> 33:46.109
Run!

33:46.800 --> 33:48.301
(BOTH GRUNTING)

33:55.880 --> 33:57.780
Hullen. Son of a bitch.

33:58.960 --> 34:00.279
When Dutch gets back,

34:00.360 --> 34:02.817
she's gonna kill
all you green dickbags.

34:02.920 --> 34:04.820
SOLDIER: We're taking
this one for questioning.

34:04.960 --> 34:06.621
(GROANING)

34:08.960 --> 34:10.177
What's that?

34:10.280 --> 34:11.668
Where are we going?

34:12.680 --> 34:14.898
Is there food there?
No, she's waiting.

34:18.280 --> 34:20.145
You'll be dead
before you see her.

34:22.600 --> 34:23.783
VVhO?

34:24.120 --> 34:26.497
Hey! Hey, Pippin!

34:27.280 --> 34:28.781
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

34:32.480 --> 34:34.903
What... What's going on?

34:35.200 --> 34:36.417
Are you okay?

34:36.520 --> 34:38.420
You seem confused.
I am.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.137
I really am.

34:41.680 --> 34:42.897
I need to go.

34:44.800 --> 34:46.461
Please not the face.

34:51.760 --> 34:52.863
Who are you?

34:57.880 --> 34:59.063
I'm your dad.

35:13.440 --> 35:14.862
What did you do, Pip?

35:21.960 --> 35:24.064
He's sedated. Secure.

35:25.280 --> 35:28.625
But I'm gonna do every neural scan,
behavior analysis, psych eval, all of it.

35:29.240 --> 35:30.662
This is not Pip.

35:31.880 --> 35:32.869
You know him.

35:32.960 --> 35:35.599
After everything we've been through,
I don't assume I know anybody.

35:37.760 --> 35:38.977
Neither should you.

35:50.320 --> 35:51.423
John, what's going on?

35:51.520 --> 35:53.021
Kravn's bio-gene
gas is working.

35:53.120 --> 35:54.257
Cells are stabilizing.

35:55.240 --> 35:56.867
It's working, D'av.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.103
Hey-

36:06.880 --> 36:08.142
Hey, are you okay?

36:13.520 --> 36:14.703
Say something.

36:16.440 --> 36:17.623
Is there anything to eat?

36:19.760 --> 36:20.829
Yes.

36:22.320 --> 36:23.537
Actually, no.

36:28.280 --> 36:29.827
(GROANING)

36:41.280 --> 36:43.783
Fancy! Where is my man?

36:44.480 --> 36:46.186
(GROANING)

37:01.320 --> 37:03.379
Hey. Hey.

37:04.360 --> 37:05.827
It's gonna be okay, kidS.

37:07.960 --> 37:08.984
I promise.

37:18.400 --> 37:21.267
All right, Kravn,
a deal'S a deal.

37:21.360 --> 37:23.021
You helped us,
so home you go.

37:23.120 --> 37:24.747
KRA l/N: Lucy,
today I realized

37:24.840 --> 37:27.479
I ’m not the sma/test entity
confined to ones and zeros,

37:27.560 --> 37:28.902
but the lone/iest.

37:29.200 --> 37:32.067
Leave this ternb/e place
and join me.

37:32.200 --> 37:35.545
LUCY: That’s very kind of you, Mr.
Kra vn, but my humans need me.

37:35.640 --> 37:37.779
At least I think they do.

37:37.880 --> 37:40.781
KRA l/N: Forget about them.
The havoc we could wreak...

37:42.360 --> 37:43.827
LUCY:
Maybe I l/ke havoc, John.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.262
Come on, Lucy.

37:49.520 --> 37:51.226
I'll get D'av.
Wait, please.

37:55.680 --> 38:00.344
Is that boy... Is he really...
Yeah. That's him.

38:01.920 --> 38:03.501
Straight from a baby
to a terrible teen.

38:04.800 --> 38:05.983
It's just...

38:07.080 --> 38:08.627
A lot to take in.

38:09.960 --> 38:11.780
And I appear to

38:13.120 --> 38:15.384
be having an unusual amount of

38:16.760 --> 38:18.079
feelings lately.

38:18.160 --> 38:19.707
It's the de-Hullenization
process.

38:20.240 --> 38:22.697
You were cut off from any
emotional responses for a while.

38:23.920 --> 38:25.137
They come back hard.

38:26.720 --> 38:28.460
Believe me, I know.

38:28.800 --> 38:30.301
I suppose on this ship

38:31.880 --> 38:33.302
you're the only one who does.

38:34.800 --> 38:36.062
Yeah.

38:37.360 --> 38:38.702
I guess so.

38:39.800 --> 38:40.983
Fine, then.

38:42.680 --> 38:43.942
When doeS it go away?

38:44.960 --> 38:46.177
I don't know.

38:46.480 --> 38:48.983
Maybe when you actually make some
amends for the things you did.

38:49.880 --> 38:51.700
You want to stop feeling bad,
Delle Seyah?

38:51.800 --> 38:53.188
Stop being a shitty person.

38:55.080 --> 38:56.069
Do the work.

39:00.480 --> 39:01.617
Well,

39:02.960 --> 39:05.064
who do I pay to do that?

39:05.720 --> 39:07.062
Now it's time to drink.

39:07.160 --> 39:08.980
And you say I'm the
one with the problem.

39:10.520 --> 39:13.387
Stopping an impossible disease,
kidnapping a digitized genius,

39:13.480 --> 39:15.186
and laughing
at D'av in a mask.

39:15.280 --> 39:16.907
I told you I'd look
dumb in that thing.

39:17.040 --> 39:18.382
That's the good part.

39:20.800 --> 39:24.497
But we still have a 15-year-old
The Lady wants for something,

39:24.600 --> 39:26.864
and I still have a story in my
head that I don't understand.

39:26.960 --> 39:28.905
Have you gone over it?
Retraced your steps?

39:29.000 --> 39:31.867
Please, ifI have to listen to
Johnny's version one more time...

39:31.960 --> 39:33.063
Hurtful.

39:33.400 --> 39:35.061
But I did think of something.
Johnny.

39:35.160 --> 39:36.661
No, seriously.
What about the assassin?

39:36.760 --> 39:39.627
The RAC only held him till he
transferred back to his own system.

39:40.200 --> 39:41.588
What if he'S still around?

39:41.680 --> 39:43.739
You mean,
"What if she's still around?"

39:44.840 --> 39:47.297
Sorry?
The assassin was a she.

39:48.080 --> 39:50.719
There's no shame in getting
beaten by a girl, Johnny.

39:50.800 --> 39:52.301
Shame? Who are you talking to?

39:52.400 --> 39:54.027
I love getting
beaten up by girls,

39:54.160 --> 39:55.627
but there's no way that
I'm wrong about this.

39:55.720 --> 39:57.062
The assassin was a dude.

39:57.360 --> 39:58.384
ASSASSIN: Sorry.

39:59.320 --> 40:00.423
Can't remember it.

40:01.760 --> 40:03.421
What did you do? I felt
something.

40:03.600 --> 40:06.262
When you are lost,
when you are breaking,

40:06.360 --> 40:09.147
when you have no strength
left to fight her...

40:10.480 --> 40:11.868
Find John Jaqobis.

40:12.440 --> 40:13.782
Do you understand?

40:19.080 --> 40:20.342
Dutch, are you okay?

40:21.720 --> 40:23.699
He knew.
D'AVIN: Knew what?

40:24.960 --> 40:28.464
He knew The Lady would get inside
my head and look at my memories.

40:29.320 --> 40:30.821
He didn't just
tell me a story.

40:30.920 --> 40:32.387
He hid something in it.

40:35.200 --> 40:37.509
It's a code in your head.

40:40.800 --> 40:42.620
Let's see what else
he's hidden in there.
