00:42.503 --> 00:45.519
And 5% HACI? NDOLAS

00:45.520 --> 00:51.820
THAT'S NO LIFE "
Orson Welles (1915-1985)

00:56.703 --> 00:59.701
I have not sung
in a Broadway musical,

00:59.702 --> 01:02.719
but I've done it all,
for better or worse.

01:02.720 --> 01:04.718
I pel? Particles small as
and large.

01:04.720 --> 01:07.699
I daytime soaps
and night.

01:07.700 --> 01:10.714
I mini-series, actu?
on and off Broadway,

01:10.715 --> 01:14.708
I Radio
and returned? the pel? particles

01:14.709 --> 01:19.016
because when it's good,
It is? nica.

01:22.720 --> 01:27.717
I have the belief that
I've never done a good.

01:27.718 --> 01:32.723
Sometimes he sat on it was a pe? N
a qualified principal.

01:32.724 --> 01:37.029
I was the spies to flip Tula
Mike Nichols tortillas.

01:37.709 --> 01:39.716
I was not the omelet,

01:39.717 --> 01:42.725
or spinach and olives
in the tortilla.

01:42.726 --> 01:46.712
Quiz? I was the salt
with which it is seasoned,

01:46.713 --> 01:51.718
or principal obstru? all
how good I could do.

01:51.719 --> 01:54.704
They were unable.

01:54.705 --> 01:56.710
You try to ignore the principal,

01:56.711 --> 01:59.726
or you do as if there
and you try to avoid it,

01:59.727 --> 02:05.722
but it is how to avoid the vagina
when you leave your mother.

02:05.723 --> 02:09.023
? C? Mo can do?

02:14.708 --> 02:17.714
The pin? Ass is a good film,
with a good director.

02:17.715 --> 02:21.701
I received? a call
My agent

02:21.702 --> 02:24.728
and I found me in ...

02:24.729 --> 02:28.706
... The worst time
my divorce.

02:28.707 --> 02:31.723
That was the worst time
of my life,

02:31.724 --> 02:34.713
but are they? my phone rang

02:34.714 --> 02:37.704
and my agent asked me ?:
"? C? Mo est? S?"

02:37.705 --> 02:41.717
I told him I had spent
One day I played terrible.

02:41.718 --> 02:46.718
He asked me? it was the place
where he was declaring

02:46.719 --> 02:51.714
and to request all
I was called Juan Trippe.

02:51.715 --> 02:54.700
It was the will sign that Scorsese

02:54.701 --> 02:56.720
I had to die
a role in his film.

02:56.721 --> 03:01.721
I There would be all I liked to see ?,
John was exciting.

and will fly, curse? No!

03:11.729 --> 03:12.728
I hope so.

03:12.729 --> 03:16.717
US people deserve
something for their $ 13 million.

03:16.718 --> 03:19.018
People think...

03:20.700 --> 03:23.013
Think about the money.

03:24.700 --> 03:27.023
And thinks it
fame,

03:27.712 --> 03:30.703
and he thinks that it is the ego,

03:30.704 --> 03:33.726
but when Scorsese
He gave me that role,

03:33.727 --> 03:38.005
I can not tell you
which signific? to m ?.

using the big politics
as background,

without presenting

between the actor and the role </ i>

<I> and create something bold and dark
from you and for you. </ i>

I want your fingers goals

One of the teachers achievements

07:29.715 --> 07:32.719
in the history of Directors
directing actors,

07:32.720 --> 07:35.703
Bertolucci was making that
Brando.

07:41.700 --> 07:45.029
It may be within a script

07:45.700 --> 07:49.719
but must be violent
and it takes a woman.

07:49.720 --> 07:53.701
As I said,
I can not pinpoint the reason? n

07:53.702 --> 07:58.008

for this film.

08:19.713 --> 08:22.725

10:24.719 --> 10:25.724
<I>? And secondly? </ I>

12:08.718 --> 12:13.012
I wondered if they were going to get you
to my room n.

I started? with l? nea ...

And continued to? with that.

13:42.708 --> 13:44.722

13:44.723 --> 13:50.718
Quiz? she felt?

15:34.702 --> 15:38.712
Since d? Ed is a
division? n deep in France

15:38.713 --> 15:41.728
between Cahiers du Cin? ma
and Positif.

15:41.729 --> 15:45.700
<I> Cahiers du Cin? Ma was famous
in the 50 </ i>

15:45.701 --> 15:50.700
<I> for all filmmakers
They formed the New Wave. </ i>

15:50.701 --> 15:54.726
They were enthusiastic
of American films

15:54.727 --> 15:57.713
<I> as Sam Fuller
and Nicholas Ray, </ i>

15:57.714 --> 16:01.714

Valdhalla was the film.

16:22.722 --> 16:24.713
This was the place.

16:24.714 --> 16:29.704
I never miss a festival.
I find it exciting.

16:29.705 --> 16:31.721
The plan is where to? Or

16:31.722 --> 16:36.700
and once half of the films
important in ten d? ace.

16:36.701 --> 16:37.718
Is essential.

16:37.719 --> 16:40.724
Le Film Francais presents
a guide? a daily

16:40.725 --> 16:43.711
what they say the cr? ticos

16:43.712 --> 16:47.723
and if you look at the list
Positif and Cahiers,

16:47.724 --> 16:51.702
They are opposed by 99%.

16:51.703 --> 16:53.717
It seems like
They consult each other prior

16:53.718 --> 16:56.726
to disagree ever.

16:56.727 --> 17:00.706
Thank you very much for coming.

<I> I was invited to jury

17:09.710 --> 17:14.728
<I> "You must come quickly,
to support Henri Langlois </ i>

17:14.729 --> 17:20.029
<I> and have it return
the Cin? math? que ". </ i>

17:20.707 --> 17:26.029
<I> It was a beloved man
for youth, including myself, </ i>

17:26.700 --> 17:30.713
<I> but Dirig? To Cin? Math? That
with a lot of clutter. </ i>

17:30.714 --> 17:35.029
<I> He kept copies of films
under his bed. </ i>

17:35.700 --> 17:38.724
<I> Langlois was a? Cone.
I adored Henri Langlois, </ i>

17:38.725 --> 17:44.719
<I> but the government? Little

<I> "Comrades, est? N coming
Nice students. "</ i>

18:13.723 --> 18:18.728
<I> As the word suggests,
a festival is to have fun </ i>

18:18.729 --> 18:24.024
<I> and were angry, but not
Change? to anything if it would stop. </ i>

18:24.702 --> 18:29.707
<I> m? S, a? Adi? one joy? to
absurd at all. </ i>

18:29.708 --> 18:32.714
Disfrut? a lot
when he was "Mean Streets."

18:32.715 --> 18:35.723
<I> I was the pas? all right,
I stayed at the Carlton, </ i>

18:35.724 --> 18:38.724
<I> where conoc? many people. </ i>

There were interviews
and people are praised.

18:42.707 --> 18:49.007

NovoCento 1900 "...

18:49.701 --> 18:51.716

18:51.717 --> 18:55.700
that lasted
a little m? s five hours.

18:55.701 --> 18:59.723
There was a d? to
dedicated to this film.

18:59.724 --> 19:03.713
The festival stopped,
there was only "NovoCento".

19:03.714 --> 19:08.029
The first part of the evening
and the second part at night.

19:09.724 --> 19:14.720
It was the best moment
my megaloman? a.

19:14.721 --> 19:18.027
If I see the film again,
or part of the film,

19:18.718 --> 19:21.720
I m going to see me? same

19:21.721 --> 19:25.717

Oc? ano pleasure

19:25.718 --> 19:29.710

He was young, ten? a desires

19:29.711 --> 19:33.029
and I saw my wishlist
They were satisfied.

19:33.700 --> 19:38.705
Pas? two d? as with DeNiro,
Jodi Foster and I think Harvey.

19:38.706 --> 19:42.702
Tennessee Williams Dirig? A
Reject the jury? violence,

19:42.703 --> 19:45.725
but we dined with Serge Leoni
and Costa-Gavras,

19:45.726 --> 19:48.709
who they were on the jury,
and gust them ?.

19:48.710 --> 19:53.707
We dined at the L'Oasis,
Leoni and talk to Costa.

19:53.708 --> 19:59.007
It's appreciated, we went
and the pel? cula won ?.

20:00.703 --> 20:01.726
Fuck Tennessee Williams.

20:01.727 --> 20:04.717
? Qu? happens?
I like his work.

20:04.718 --> 20:07.019
The ironic that I do is praise.

20:13.701 --> 20:16.700
When young,
I went to Cannes with the film

20:16.701 --> 20:20.717
"You're a Big Boy Now"
Elizabeth Hartman,

20:20.718 --> 20:23.723
who she was a wonderful young

20:23.724 --> 20:26.715
and Tony Billman, who was a child? o.

20:26.716 --> 20:30.720
It was a dream
and it is given ?? gently.

20:30.721 --> 20:34.720
It was not a film festival.
It was a film market,

20:34.721 --> 20:37.728
where all people
He was knowledgeable

20:37.729 --> 20:43.701
and knew whether you go to your film? a
well before t? same.

20:43.702 --> 20:45.728
It seemed to me?
an aggressive environment.

20:45.729 --> 20:48.726
? Do you sought money
in that market?

20:48.727 --> 20:52.029
- No, and I did not return.
- Do not come back?

20:52.700 --> 20:55.721
No, and not the fault of
Cannes managers.

20:55.722 --> 20:59.723
It attracts people

20:59.724 --> 21:04.023
and press it attracts.
It looks like a bullfight.

21:04.700 --> 21:07.719
It was after? s Film Festival

21:07.720 --> 21:10.722
when Robert Altman
He brought his film "3 Women".

21:10.723 --> 21:12.713

21:12.714 --> 21:15.719
<I> It was the only time he came
the Cannes Film Festival. </ i>

21:15.720 --> 21:18.711
The film won? the award
Best Actress,

21:18.712 --> 21:20.721
but Altman not won? nothing.

21:20.722 --> 21:23.721

21:23.722 --> 21:28.711
It was Pauline, arrived? Altman,
Pauline saw,

21:28.712 --> 21:31.721
and he said, despite being friends
hac from 7 to you?:

21:31.722 --> 21:35.703
"Damn Whore,
I was going to like my film.

21:35.704 --> 21:39.723
You were going to support me and do not gust ?.
Did not give me an award. "

21:39.724 --> 21:44.018
Explot? against all.
It was embarrassing.

21:45.701 --> 21:46.718
H? Blame Damon.

21:46.719 --> 21:51.728
It is legendary in the world
film finance.

21:51.729 --> 21:55.713
- You use that word?
- S ?, pioneered.

21:55.714 --> 21:57.700
? Pioneer in what ??

21:57.701 --> 22:00.701
In the sales process

22:00.702 --> 22:03.715
to finance pel? particles

22:03.716 --> 22:07.705

and what should I show? a
happen in USA

22:19.720 --> 22:22.720
and make up? No Money
with gains,

22:22.721 --> 22:26.017
I can finance the pel? cula
you want.

22:26.702 --> 22:29.706
I just got
$ 80 million,

22:29.707 --> 22:32.721
for a film with Denzel
Washington and Mark Wahlberg.

22:32.722 --> 22:37.704
? D? Nde is the money?

22:37.705 --> 22:41.707

23:02.700 --> 23:04.709
I have Alec

23:04.710 --> 23:06.720
It is an adventure
politics-rom? ntica,

23:06.721 --> 23:08.724
set
in the Middle East.

23:08.725 --> 23:12.714
Me interested? Finance

23:12.715 --> 23:15.717
Neve Campbell

23:15.718 --> 23:19.702
Adventure politics-rom? Ntica,
between 15 and 20 million.

23:19.703 --> 23:25.003
Neve Campbell is wonderful,

23:25.700 --> 23:28.723
but today in d? a
no commercial value.

23:28.724 --> 23:29.724
Right.

23:29.725 --> 23:33.017
Alec Baldwin is sensational,

23:33.705 --> 23:38.717
but does not suggest
a theatrical film.

23:38.718 --> 23:42.719
Just to know, though our
I could not film? cost less,

23:42.720 --> 23:49.009

23:53.710 --> 23:56.001
Four or five million.

23:56.700 --> 23:58.711
- I'm too old for that.
- ?Really?

23:58.712 --> 24:00.713
I have the ...

24:00.714 --> 24:02.714
It is horrendous.

24:02.715 --> 24:07.029
It is very high, or too low.
Nothing in between.

24:07.703 --> 24:11.721
- There is never enough money.
- Fighting to get money?

24:11.722 --> 24:16.703
I had many problems
to film "Repulsion"

24:16.704 --> 24:20.707
because, unfortunately,
double the budget.

24:20.708 --> 24:22.709
The budget of "Repulsion"

24:22.710 --> 24:27.018
It was of 41,000 pounds

24:27.717 --> 24:31.713
and ended? costing about 90.

24:31.714 --> 24:32.721
- Right.
- Why ??

24:32.722 --> 24:36.715
We wanted to make a film
90,000 pounds.

24:36.716 --> 24:40.726
I am an Australian distributor
and another Russian.

24:40.727 --> 24:44.710
I est? N waiting
to give me money.

24:44.711 --> 24:47.705
No politics, no adventure,
no sex.

24:47.706 --> 24:48.728
Duty? To be comedy.

24:48.729 --> 24:50.726
- No no no...
- No comedy?

24:50.727 --> 24:55.702
- Habr? some humor.
- There must be comedy.

24:55.703 --> 24:56.721
- ?You think?
- Clear.

24:56.722 --> 24:59.021
? Why? you wear a tuxedo?

25:00.700 --> 25:03.706
They are m? s six.
? Am I a farmer?

25:03.707 --> 25:05.712
I know well "30 Rock".

25:05.713 --> 25:10.020
But there is something.
You got a submarine?

25:12.724 --> 25:14.724
? D? Where are? Alpha, Josei?

25:14.725 --> 25:18.708
You did the film Submarine
A long time ago.

25:18.709 --> 25:20.708
We need action? N
and submarines.

25:20.709 --> 25:24.726
You can put sex.
Le falt? in the other.

25:24.727 --> 25:28.023
- "The last tango with missiles?".
- Of course.

25:30.727 --> 25:33.712
If it was not a film g? Gangsters,

25:33.713 --> 25:36.716
or alg? n g? nero
to which he was associated,

25:36.717 --> 25:40.721
She had to ask
c? m going to do this film.

25:40.722 --> 25:43.716
She did not know for d? Nde begin.

25:43.717 --> 25:46.710
Nobody wanted? To do
"Apocalypse Now"

25:46.711 --> 25:50.702
after? s of "The Godfather"
and? scar that won ?.

25:50.703 --> 25:52.717
It is m? s, ten? six? scar,

25:52.718 --> 25:56.728
but threw? Through the window
and they disrupted.

25:56.729 --> 26:00.029
My mother told me
deb not? to do that.

26:00.700 --> 26:03.702
Then picked up? pieces,

26:03.703 --> 26:08.702
he went to the Academy in LA
and said:

26:08.703 --> 26:12.719
"My poor son, the maid
I was cleaning? scar ".

26:12.720 --> 26:15.029
I was very frustrated and said:

26:15.700 --> 26:20.717
"? What? I do to
make the film I want? "

26:20.718 --> 26:23.704
Can we help with the actress?

26:23.705 --> 26:25.724
A new star
Jessica Chestain.

26:25.725 --> 26:29.707
Listen,
I will not betray Neve.

26:29.708 --> 26:31.699
I love her, worked? with her.

26:31.700 --> 26:34.723
I can invent another paper
for Neve.

26:34.724 --> 26:39.029
- Neve may be the sp?.
- And we can use to Jessica.

26:39.700 --> 26:40.714
? We killed Neve?

26:40.715 --> 26:42.726
We did not kill her, the hurt

26:42.727 --> 26:46.705
and appears with the arm
in a sling.

26:46.706 --> 26:48.721
If Neve appears, the assassinate.

26:48.722 --> 26:51.029
You convert? A star.

26:52.717 --> 26:56.699
<I>? Cu? L is the probability
Damon? </ i>

26:56.700 --> 26:57.708
<I> Two to one against. </ I>

26:57.709 --> 27:00.699
<I>? S ?? I say six to one
against. </ i>

27:00.700 --> 27:02.716
<I> Although you had reason? N,
do not worry </ i>

27:02.717 --> 27:04.726
<I> because we lack Avi Lerner </ i>

27:04.727 --> 27:09.019
<I> and has m? S films rod? Ndose
the other sellers together. </ i>

27:09.701 --> 27:12.716
To succeed in this business,

27:12.717 --> 27:15.721
you have to become
a type very ego? sta.

27:15.722 --> 27:20.725
You have to tell your mother,
your wife, your children

27:20.726 --> 27:22.726
and who needed

27:22.727 --> 27:27.699
it must not be without reason? n
and without a prop? site,

27:27.700 --> 27:33.007
but you say to all this
is your thing, that's what you are,

27:33.703 --> 27:39.017
and I was not able to do so
in all this time.

27:42.720 --> 27:45.703
-? Qu? You do here ??
- We are filming.

27:45.704 --> 27:46.725

28:17.711 --> 28:20.710

You started as an assistant
Pasolini? right?

Cathedral of St. Patrick.

30:21.704 --> 30:23.705
I enjoyed when I was all?

30:23.706 --> 30:27.717

and cruelty

Regrettably,
He had a tragedy s? loss

around me.

30:37.717 --> 30:41.706

where people with houses,
fences, and it's serious,

30:47.715 --> 30:50.705

Those were hard times.
Needless to talk

31:03.711 --> 31:08.709
Although he had to benefits
and was film school,

31:08.710 --> 31:13.704
because a phrase from Lenin:
"Of all the arts,

31:13.705 --> 31:16.716
the film is the m? s important
for us".

31:16.717 --> 31:19.712

They were portions

34:09.717 --> 34:12.022

34:12.699 --> 34:15.701
When I went to Washington Square
College, NYU, was great.

34:15.702 --> 34:16.708
And Haig met.

34:16.710 --> 34:18.714

Haig Manoogian.

34:18.715 --> 34:23.710
She had a lot of passion? N

34:34.713 --> 34:36.716
And I said:

34:47.713 --> 34:51.717
Exactly, not accepted
in their paper? particles.

34:51.717 --> 34:53.022
"Do not bring that."

34:57.717 --> 34:59.702
? To d? Nde are we going?

34:59.703 --> 35:05.016
This is the world
film business.

35:08.700 --> 35:11.708
? These people is? selling
their pel? particles?

35:11.709 --> 35:15.025
Or looking for a film
to market,

35:15.716 --> 35:19.726
or partner
to find a distributor.

35:19.727 --> 35:24.005
It's like the Diamant Center? fero
at 47th Street.

35:25.724 --> 35:27.722

Sure,? C? Mo est? S? Come in.

35:34.722 --> 35:39.700
I do not like the Festival
Cannes nor do I believe in the festival.

35:39.701 --> 35:43.029
One thing is the market that is?
Always and another is the festival.

35:43.700 --> 35:45.713
Almost all films
at the festival

35:45.714 --> 35:51.703
They were seen by their mothers,
his cousins ​​and no m? s.

35:51.704 --> 35:54.716
The Fantasy? Stico Cannes
It is a Romanian film,

35:54.717 --> 35:58.718
a Belgian film, a film give? s
or a Norwegian film

35:58.719 --> 36:02.706
They are presented at the same time
and journalists themselves.

36:02.707 --> 36:03.713
There is opportunity.

36:03.714 --> 36:07.700
S ?, against productions
US with big stars.

36:07.701 --> 36:10.721
Big films
protect small years.

36:10.722 --> 36:14.706
The stars protect
to unknown actors.

36:14.707 --> 36:18.714
When I make a pel? Cula,
I think of the gain.

36:18.715 --> 36:21.720
Before doing it,
s? cu? nto I am going to sell.

36:21.721 --> 36:25.726
Not about
with the creative side.

36:25.727 --> 36:28.726
I see it as a business.

36:28.727 --> 36:32.720
Cinema is not poetry? A, nor is
painting; You need money.

36:32.721 --> 36:36.710
Some people say

36:36.711 --> 36:40.703
that here? there are
a large shopping circus,

36:40.704 --> 36:42.723
but it is very important.

36:42.724 --> 36:46.720
When we stop having
advertising everywhere,

36:46.721 --> 36:49.725
would not have? m? s money
and would not have? m? s films.

36:49.726 --> 36:53.029
- True.
- We can not be naive.

36:53.700 --> 36:56.705
Cannes is an h? I hybrid fabulous.

36:56.706 --> 36:59.722
Malroux wrote?
an essay on the film

36:59.723 --> 37:01.721
? and the last prayer is famous:

37:01.722 --> 37:04.715
"Adem? S film,
there is an industry. "

37:04.716 --> 37:07.728
Cannes has always reminded
that prayer? n.

37:07.729 --> 37:10.714
Tambi? N there is an industry
which is combined

37:10.715 --> 37:13.721
because it is the nature
imperfect film.

37:13.722 --> 37:19.712
We want to make a film very
pol? mico set in Iraq.

37:19.713 --> 37:23.720

Get out of a TV show

37:33.720 --> 37:36.728
I need half of the s optimal?

37:36.729 --> 37:41.700
and, without trying to be
very pretentious,

37:41.701 --> 37:44.706
I want to resume my career
At the cinema.

37:44.707 --> 37:47.021

37:52.710 --> 37:57.025
Esc? Chame, I am known
as someone sincere.

37:57.716 --> 38:02.724
You need support
other stars of cinema.

38:02.725 --> 38:06.713
Gerry Butler received? support for
four on ...

38:06.714 --> 38:07.728

38:07.729 --> 38:11.711
You want me to sleep

38:11.712 --> 38:14.713
If possible five.
It will be better.

38:14.714 --> 38:18.715
In the world of today is
very dif? cult or impossible

38:18.716 --> 38:22.713
a man to do a film
alone with his name.

38:22.714 --> 38:27.701
He makes few years,
people went to the movies and dec to?:

38:27.702 --> 38:31.026
"It's a film by Johnny Depp,
I will see it".

38:31.707 --> 38:33.723
"It is a film of Marlon Brando,
I will see it."

38:33.724 --> 38:38.019
And when I was popular,
They went to see Jimmy.

38:38.710 --> 38:39.728
That does not work today.

38:39.729 --> 38:45.009
Find out the reasons why
a franchise earn both.

38:52.706 --> 38:54.715
Johnny Depp is terrific.

38:54.716 --> 38:59.701
The film makes you want
and they do not care.

38:59.702 --> 39:02.018
God m? Or,
is the cop that we burn.

39:05.707 --> 39:07.709
It acts normally.

39:07.710 --> 39:12.015
That film produces the same as
a franchise because they are fans.

39:12.722 --> 39:15.019
They will not love me.

39:15.700 --> 39:19.005
The knights envied me
ladies and reject me.

39:22.712 --> 39:24.713

39:26.701 --> 39:30.712
I like, it is fabulous,
but you can not sell it.

39:30.713 --> 39:34.708
We use the word in France
"Profitable". ? The US used?

39:34.709 --> 39:35.709
Of course.

39:35.710 --> 39:36.722
It does not mean anything.

39:36.723 --> 39:41.702
Today in d? To receive all
scripts that are possible.

39:41.703 --> 39:43.725
I can read the script
and see if it suits me

39:43.726 --> 39:46.716
because I'm famous
and I receive scripts.

39:46.717 --> 39:49.707
Profitability

39:49.708 --> 39:52.718
If you are attracted to history
you will see the pel? cula.

40:11.709 --> 40:15.718
She is beautiful, but not a woman
you can sell.

40:15.719 --> 40:18.715
What happens is that
I do not have 20 years

40:18.716 --> 40:22.720
and I'm on the crest of the wave,
but tomorrow no.

40:22.721 --> 40:26.699

46:11.714 --> 46:12.715

He was the head of security.
I hac? An out in front of him

46:16.710 --> 46:21.700
and had many people
because it was Elvis.

46:21.701 --> 46:26.723
Elvis Perry, bald, mustachioed
and a mark on his face,

46:26.724 --> 46:31.029
but I swear it was Elvis
for all of us.

46:31.707 --> 46:36.714
Power show
totally vulnerable,

46:36.715 --> 46:40.718
open up to many people
Seeing me

46:40.719 --> 46:46.719
and feel the process to arrive
to a level of emotions,

46:46.720 --> 46:49.718
It's what makes me feel alive.

46:49.719 --> 46:53.716
I have an idea of ​​the role
I play in the film,

46:53.717 --> 46:56.718
but not s? exactly
what har? in the scene

46:56.719 --> 47:00.706
to see in the eyes and actions
of whom I speak.

47:00.707 --> 47:04.718
I try to work with actorsbetter than I, as? I strive.

47:04.719 --> 47:06.707
I must keep up.

47:06.708 --> 47:09.707
It is a moment of panic
and I must follow.

47:09.708 --> 47:12.712
It is very rare, as an actor,

47:12.713 --> 47:16.708
let go during
the recording? n of a scene,

47:16.709 --> 47:19.705
until the point
not knowing what you did.

47:19.706 --> 47:23.706
And if Francis dec to?:
"Well, let".

47:23.707 --> 47:27.708
She knew she was good,
at least Qued? satisfied.

47:27.709 --> 47:28.728
? Do what you order ?!

47:28.729 --> 47:33.014
? From having been at war,
not be? to here ?!

47:33.704 --> 47:35.026
Pap? had to Jenk,? and what ??

47:39.706 --> 47:40.724
I did not mean that.

47:40.725 --> 47:46.703
But most? At times, you must
be aware of what you do,

47:46.704 --> 47:48.720
and is 10%
you lose in actuaci? n.

47:48.721 --> 47:53.026
Your job is to look
always something new happening.

47:53.700 --> 47:58.702
That is ruined when
Know your entire set l? lines,

47:58.703 --> 47:59.723
even the techs.

47:59.724 --> 48:02.716
You're wrong during rehearsals.

48:02.717 --> 48:05.029
Someone placed tape on the floor

48:05.708 --> 48:08.717
and you stay tied
what you did at first.

48:08.718 --> 48:12.023
They start with a wide shot
They never used.

48:12.705 --> 48:16.702
You waste novelty
in the general plans.

48:16.703 --> 48:18.709
They approach,
and end of d? to

48:18.710 --> 48:21.706
comes the foreground,
which it is what they use.

48:21.707 --> 48:25.710
Use it? Last for all?
It is when you do it perfect,

48:25.711 --> 48:28.014
but you talk like a robot.

48:29.700 --> 48:34.710
Leave the set feeling
you failed because nothing changed ?.

48:34.711 --> 48:36.725
We know the speed
by the script.

48:36.726 --> 48:41.721
But really, if Bob Harvey
and the rest is? n at the scene,

48:41.722 --> 48:43.728
They know with qui? nes work.

48:43.729 --> 48:48.722
I hope to create something
and at the same time I'm afraid ...

48:48.723 --> 48:53.024
? C? Mo say?
? It could? create an environment

48:53.712 --> 48:58.027
conducive something magnetic? fico
and unexpected?

48:58.706 --> 49:00.716
The best experiences
that I had

49:00.717 --> 49:04.726
They are led by the environment.

49:04.727 --> 49:10.014
Michelle and I were
tucked into the film for years

49:10.708 --> 49:12.722
conoc not we? masters.

49:12.723 --> 49:18.016
It was structured so that
we met? ramos when shooting.

49:18.710 --> 49:22.029
As we walk,
? L told ad? Nde go.

49:22.709 --> 49:24.717
We'll go from here ?, all ?.

49:24.718 --> 49:27.725
The night program?
to roam freely

49:27.726 --> 49:32.713
while we were filming.
Est? Bamos met? Ndonos.

49:32.714 --> 49:36.719
Good directors
They are supervisors.

49:36.720 --> 49:39.703
Knowing my position? N,
sabr? what? I seek.

49:39.704 --> 49:40.717
I know the conflict.

49:40.718 --> 49:44.714
If I can hardly remember it,
est? misspelled.

49:44.715 --> 49:49.707
For example, in "Goodfellas"
Joe Pesci says: "I'm funny?"

49:49.708 --> 49:50.708
S ?.

49:50.709 --> 49:53.705
It was something that happened to you? Joe.

49:53.706 --> 49:56.023
He said har? To the film
if inclu? to the scene.

49:58.703 --> 50:02.005
Damned. Desire? To be great.

50:03.711 --> 50:06.711
You're the best. Very funny.

50:06.712 --> 50:08.017
Very funny.

50:08.724 --> 50:11.005
? C? Mo that funny?

50:11.722 --> 50:16.018
You know, it's a good story.
You're a funny guy.

50:16.719 --> 50:19.022
? In what? you speak, my voice?

50:19.729 --> 50:23.017
You're just funny.

50:23.721 --> 50:26.704
By the way
when you tell the story.

50:26.705 --> 50:29.027
? In what? how?
? Qu? funny?

50:29.715 --> 50:30.725
The misunderstood.

50:30.726 --> 50:33.725
Anthony, an adult,
He knows what he said.

50:33.726 --> 50:35.726
? Qu? you say? ? C? Mo that funny?

50:35.727 --> 50:39.715
They were two c? Maras
doing medium shots.

50:39.716 --> 50:42.711
While changing
the tone of the scene,

50:42.712 --> 50:47.026
the faces of people
and the atmosphere changed.

50:47.702 --> 50:53.700
But I had to talk to Joe
for 5 or 6 improvisations.

50:53.701 --> 50:54.701
With Ray.

50:54.702 --> 50:58.706
S ?. We played with it.
I wrote? some things.

50:58.707 --> 51:02.705
To reach certain level,
Joe had to lead.

51:02.706 --> 51:05.709
T? You said it was funny,
not me.

51:05.710 --> 51:08.725
? Qu? Devils
I'm funny?

51:08.726 --> 51:11.013
Tell me what? is.

51:16.713 --> 51:21.721
- Stop it, Tommy.
- Damn, you almost fall.

51:21.722 --> 51:24.029
Woody Allen is the ideal manager.

51:24.709 --> 51:26.699
And, oddly,

51:26.700 --> 51:31.704
It reminds me of the deceased
John Hughes at the time.

51:31.705 --> 51:34.718
? L was a director and writer
very successful.

51:34.719 --> 51:39.728
The first pel? Cula I did with
? L was "She's Having a Baby"

51:39.729 --> 51:42.711
with Kevin Bacon
and Elizabeth McGovern.

51:42.712 --> 51:44.718
Film? Bamos with Hughes.

51:44.719 --> 51:48.709
And if he did not like,
He shouted sticamente mood?:

51:48.710 --> 51:51.710
"? Qui? N wrote? This stuff?"
And he threw the script.

51:51.711 --> 51:56.724
Woody is the same. All
nominations he has won,

51:56.725 --> 52:00.700
think of the essentials
which is his career.

52:00.701 --> 52:02.703
His first words were:

52:02.704 --> 52:06.719
"If you would not say anything
this, do not tell.

52:06.720 --> 52:11.023
Di much as you want. "

52:11.701 --> 52:14.717
And you think:
"God m? Or what? Ego".

52:14.718 --> 52:18.714
I have worked
with others who have ...

52:18.715 --> 52:22.704
Woody Allen has
m? s talent in their areas? as

52:22.705 --> 52:24.724
others complete idiots.

52:24.725 --> 52:28.726
Those you ordered
do not add a 'quiz? s "

52:28.727 --> 52:33.709
and you say that "maybe"
go? s the party.

52:33.710 --> 52:35.724
"Do not say quiz? S, Echo your phone eve? MoSlo".

52:35.725 --> 52:38.714
No treasure my scripts.

52:38.715 --> 52:43.720

and novice director.

52:43.721 --> 52:48.713
And I'm open to suggestions.
I like the improvisation? N.

52:48.714 --> 52:55.014
Occasionally, you hear an idea
and it is twisted with humor.

52:55.718 --> 52:57.728
This is not a draft.

52:57.729 --> 53:01.715
It's a doodle
you can not delete.

53:01.716 --> 53:07.029
I had a breeding cat? Lica
conventional. That upsets you.

53:07.700 --> 53:08.714
I went to university.

53:08.715 --> 53:10.719

53:10.720 --> 53:14.703

Suddenly,
people wanted to hear.

53:32.706 --> 53:37.022
I always wanted to be a writer,
since the beginning.

53:37.700 --> 53:43.702

54:02.724 --> 54:07.702
Actually, I wrote? Since ni? A,

54:23.704 --> 54:27.711

They are a form of automedicaci? n.

Knowing you build something
Total nihilistic be prevented.

54:47.700 --> 54:48.700

Bob Towne.

54:54.720 --> 54:59.699

54:59.700 --> 55:01.701
and I told him that was impossible.

55:01.702 --> 55:04.728
"For the pel? Cula
cause impact on the audience,

55:04.729 --> 55:06.719
she must die.

55:06.720 --> 55:11.019
Evil must succeed. "

55:11.718 --> 55:14.717
Olv? Dala, Jake, it's Chinatown.

55:14.718 --> 55:18.025
As Mickey Cohen dec? A,
It is an? short anecdote.

55:18.726 --> 55:21.726
Charlotte Chandler
tells a great story

55:21.727 --> 55:26.725
on Mastroianni and Fellini,
"La Dolce Vita".

55:26.726 --> 55:30.714
Fellini He wanted to do it,
I offered? paper.

55:30.715 --> 55:34.701
Mastroianni He wanted to see the script,
Fellini told him there had to.

55:34.702 --> 55:35.720
Mastroianni needed.

55:35.721 --> 55:40.704
Fellini gave a manuscript
fat with p? pages blank,

55:40.705 --> 55:44.709
where he had a drawing
Mastroianni in a boat,

55:44.710 --> 55:45.716
in the oc? year,

55:45.717 --> 55:50.728
and his penis went down a hole
He is facing the bottom of the oc? year

55:50.729 --> 55:55.700
a beautiful mermaid
swimming around the hole.

55:55.701 --> 55:57.711
Seeing him, Mastroianni said:

55:57.712 --> 56:00.021
"The har ?.
The role is interesting. "

56:00.729 --> 56:04.726
In the film we want to do,
I am a government agent.

56:04.727 --> 56:09.716
The woman is a reporter,
left-leaning.

56:09.717 --> 56:11.721
They are poles apart.

56:11.722 --> 56:14.704
Known in Iraq,
in the war.

56:14.705 --> 56:19.026
B? Basically, as is the end
The world decide fornicate.

56:20.713 --> 56:25.700
Something crazy. We called the
pel? cula "Last Tango in Tikrit."

56:25.701 --> 56:27.728
All right. Well, what? deep.

56:27.729 --> 56:31.715
We explore what happens
between man and woman.

This is invaluable.

56:45.726 --> 56:50.011
Diane Kruger teach us? A
we are not convincing.

56:50.714 --> 56:55.728
We need to prepare another group
sales agents, 3 or 4 m? s.

57:06.724 --> 57:10.711
I think Alec has the ability.

57:10.712 --> 57:16.699
It is one of those actors that can
jump between g? genres.

It is very dif? cult to find someone
I say, "I want to."

57:48.709 --> 57:49.724
All accounts removed.

57:49.725 --> 57:53.026
And people
They are not visionary.

57:53.706 --> 57:56.026
The heads of visionaries study
no longer exist.

58:17.709 --> 58:21.021
? T you? who rules
in that society?

58:22.707 --> 58:26.725
Assuming we need
between $ 15 and $ 18 million.

58:26.726 --> 58:28.703
It's too much.

58:28.704 --> 58:30.721
Should not exceed
the $ 10 million.

58:30.722 --> 58:34.721
You must save relationship? N
It will be obtained thereby ?.

You are good.

01:01:04.701 --> 01:01:06.716

I owe this to my father.
Not responsible for this.

because not many hire
someone who does not depend on it.

01:03:47.721 --> 01:03:53.702
It's a bad job. There are prejudices
against blacks, gays and rich.

All right.

01:07:38.705 --> 01:07:39.724
It is dif? cult to know.

01:07:39.725 --> 01:07:43.711
But I always wanted to go into space.

01:07:43.712 --> 01:07:49.708
I think what m? S desire,
It s not? or if I can not,

People leaving his family,

to pursue her dream,

01:09:29.725 --> 01:09:34.029
knowing that the probability
to achieve this is almost nil.

01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:37.720
But just they do.
All share the same dream

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:42.022
and no one knows if it was
one premonici? No delirium.

01:09:42.707 --> 01:09:44.703
There is only one way to know.

01:09:44.705 --> 01:09:45.725
- Ben Schneider.

01:09:54.722 --> 01:09:56.022
? Why ??

01:09:57.703 --> 01:09:59.706
An audition? N is dif? Cult.

01:09:59.707 --> 01:10:03.713
You get it. You walk into a room
full of guys like t ?.

01:10:03.714 --> 01:10:08.723
You're not the? cowboy unique.
You hear another audition.

01:10:08.724 --> 01:10:13.720
You do not think the same,
instead of your style.

01:10:13.721 --> 01:10:14.723
Before entering,

01:10:14.724 --> 01:10:18.705
the casting director
Trading paper for another.

01:10:21.704 --> 01:10:25.022
When you enter, you see
as a pr? PRACTICE of actuaci? n.

01:10:25.710 --> 01:10:29.025
S? I do not get ?,
live alone? the experience.

01:10:29.705 --> 01:10:32.703
In the scene
you must mourn for a friend.

01:10:32.704 --> 01:10:37.721
You begin to mourn emotionally.
They receive a call and salts.

01:10:37.722 --> 01:10:39.711
You try to keep crying,

01:10:39.712 --> 01:10:42.723
but you wait for 10 minutes
and you desconcentras.

01:10:42.724 --> 01:10:47.716
You want to start and
do you continue where you left off.

01:10:47.717 --> 01:10:50.701
You go to your car and have a fine.

01:10:50.702 --> 01:10:55.011
Because the sign of the audition? N
He covered the se? al.

01:10:55.702 --> 01:11:00.706
Get in the car, you recompose.
You go to the next.

01:11:00.707 --> 01:11:04.025
You spend two hours tr? Fico
and the cycle begins again.

01:11:06.713 --> 01:11:09.712
<I> I think the three of us
a good connection? n. </ i>

01:11:09.713 --> 01:11:12.719
<I> If you write a role
original and ambitious, </ i>

01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:16.717
<I> is aiming? To immediately
and rain? to money. </ i>

01:11:16.718 --> 01:11:20.723
<I> Because money
follow the stars. </ i>

01:11:20.724 --> 01:11:24.716
<I> Jessica Chastain could? A
Neve be women and wife, </ i>

01:11:24.717 --> 01:11:28.023
<I> and divorce before you go. </ I>

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:32.722
HOMEWORK? N
FOR VANITY FAIR PARTY

01:11:32.723 --> 01:11:35.714
The sale covers
magazines are evasive.

01:11:35.715 --> 01:11:39.719
Deb? Masters retreating in.
We talked.

01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:44.700
Pod? Masters do the cover,
changing the way to do it.

01:11:44.701 --> 01:11:49.702
The one to do it,
t ?, you were together.

01:11:49.703 --> 01:11:52.704
In our culture,
It is dif? cult to find someone

01:11:52.705 --> 01:11:58.029
who can pull strings
and look good in the magazine.

01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:01.016
And something people want to read.

01:12:02.723 --> 01:12:05.711
Vanity Fair is not
magazine pel? particles,

01:12:05.712 --> 01:12:08.704
but it came back?
magazine for pel? particles.

01:12:08.705 --> 01:12:09.722
? That was intentional?

01:12:09.723 --> 01:12:14.719
No. I think the people of this
It has a fascination n

01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:16.719
with the "romance" of Hollywood.

01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:18.724
Especially,
with the old Hollywood.

01:12:18.725 --> 01:12:20.699
Perhaps we see it

01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:23.721
to trav? s of a different light
of those who live there ?.

01:12:23.722 --> 01:12:26.716
Most? To the holidays
in Hollywood

01:12:26.717 --> 01:12:30.713
seem auditions
for "Jersey Shore".

01:12:30.714 --> 01:12:32.705
We talk about now.

01:12:32.706 --> 01:12:37.701
S ?. Watch this weekend.
The pel? Particles have degenerated

01:12:37.702 --> 01:12:40.711
to the point that there pel? particles
over cartoons

01:12:40.712 --> 01:12:44.014
competing against other
of gambling.

01:12:45.705 --> 01:12:48.026
<I> Many people with lots of money. </ I>

01:12:48.701 --> 01:12:52.015
<I> You know cu? L be? A
a good idea? Steal. </ I>

01:12:52.705 --> 01:12:56.700
<I> Just I am kidding.
Although, you know, maybe not. </ I>

01:12:56.701 --> 01:13:00.008
<I> But is? crowded.
Many witnesses. </ I>

01:13:00.704 --> 01:13:03.703
<I> What unites them is moving </ i>

01:13:03.704 --> 01:13:08.703
<I> complete ignorance
they all die? n. </ i>

01:13:08.704 --> 01:13:12.723
<I>? In what? serve them? the money?
Duty? An finance us. </ I>

01:13:12.724 --> 01:13:16.026
<I> At least his name be? A
in a work of art. </ i>

01:13:16.714 --> 01:13:18.722
<I> I must be careful
or crazy?. </ i>

01:13:18.723 --> 01:13:21.699
NOBODY EVER PAID ME
WHAT VALGO

01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:24.701
BUT WITH MONEY.
Charles Baudelaire

01:13:24.702 --> 01:13:27.708
?GIVE ME MONEY!
?IT'S WHAT I WANT!

01:13:27.709 --> 01:13:28.720
THE BEATLES

01:13:28.721 --> 01:13:31.716
Recently
I was summoned err ously?:

01:13:31.717 --> 01:13:34.718
"We
many pel? particles bad ".

01:13:34.719 --> 01:13:35.723
What I said was:

01:13:35.724 --> 01:13:39.700
"As an industry, we
pel? particles bad and good ".

01:13:39.701 --> 01:13:40.717
The real problem

01:13:40.718 --> 01:13:44.724
It is that you can do
a pel? cula that nobody sees,

01:13:44.725 --> 01:13:47.720
or a bad pel? cula
everyone saw

01:13:47.721 --> 01:13:51.703
and that is the secret
to keep your job.

01:13:51.704 --> 01:13:54.728
You do not get cr? Dito
for the good that nobody saw.

01:13:54.729 --> 01:13:57.708
There are dealers

01:13:57.709 --> 01:14:00.703
those who refuse
to make the film.

01:14:00.704 --> 01:14:06.020
The truth is that not justified? N
enough money to film.

01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:08.710
It is important
was the view? n market

01:14:08.711 --> 01:14:12.707
and what they think they achieve? a
with the campaign to the pel? cula.

01:14:12.708 --> 01:14:15.716
Marketability
of pel? particles has become

01:14:15.717 --> 01:14:18.704
m? s important
their stories.

01:14:18.705 --> 01:14:21.711
It's very important
was the view? n on the pel? cula

01:14:21.712 --> 01:14:24.701
dealers
international.

01:14:24.702 --> 01:14:28.710
This influences much? Simo
decisions today.

01:14:28.711 --> 01:14:33.703
Was the view? No distributors
Local video is important.

01:14:33.704 --> 01:14:38.703
? C? Mo think this affects
quality pel? cula?

01:14:38.704 --> 01:14:41.709
While one person
making the decision? n

01:14:41.710 --> 01:14:44.716
to accept the audacity
and originality,

01:14:44.717 --> 01:14:49.708
a committee? of decision? No
It guarantees conventional shyness.

01:14:49.709 --> 01:14:52.701
For this, people
with innovative ideas

01:14:52.702 --> 01:14:55.714
You should always seek the money
outside the system.

01:14:55.715 --> 01:15:00.699
For you as a filmmaker,
and a community of agents,

01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:02.725
braking ability.

01:15:02.726 --> 01:15:05.721
When I was an actor,
She could see Tom Pollock.

01:15:05.722 --> 01:15:06.722
S ?.

01:15:06.723 --> 01:15:09.715
She could to convince him to? L
or Casey Silver

01:15:09.716 --> 01:15:14.710
to accept a pel? cula
based on my enthusiasm.

01:15:14.711 --> 01:15:18.709
Dec to them: "If you refuse,
go? another study. "

01:15:18.710 --> 01:15:20.029
It could at the time.

01:15:20.700 --> 01:15:22.721
With one out,
any study.

01:15:22.722 --> 01:15:25.029
In actuality,
that's impossible.

01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:27.699
Neither Universal
or IN NO another.

01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:28.704
? Why ??

01:15:28.705 --> 01:15:32.710
If I love something
and the rest hate it, it is not.

01:15:32.711 --> 01:15:35.709
All pel? Particles
that made us win? scar,

01:15:35.710 --> 01:15:38.717
and I say "we"
because it was not me alone,

01:15:38.718 --> 01:15:41.029
nobody wanted? a.

01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:43.728
Or "Cuckoo's Nest
or "Dance with Wolves".

01:15:43.729 --> 01:15:46.720
Sol? To have
a large margin of pel? particles

01:15:46.721 --> 01:15:49.703
like "Taxi Driver"
and "Raging Bull"

01:15:49.704 --> 01:15:52.708
until a certain point.
UA was fant? Acoustic.

01:15:52.709 --> 01:15:56.726
We were not forced to make,
dese? Bamos them.

01:15:56.727 --> 01:16:01.029
The whole group supported us in UA
on making varieties of pel? particles

01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:03.715
Consider that? semos
be? n the norm.

01:16:03.716 --> 01:16:07.726
We "Apocalypse"
and "Raging Bull" in another era.

01:16:07.727 --> 01:16:12.728
There was a? little in which hac? as
one or two large pel? particles

01:16:12.729 --> 01:16:15.715
and anchored your program
pel? particles.

01:16:15.716 --> 01:16:19.029
Now you do five of them,
? And what? remains?

01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:21.715
Somehow, I was able

01:16:21.716 --> 01:16:27.714
to navigate the thin margin
make pel? particles

01:16:27.715 --> 01:16:34.010
to consider could? a
give me two years.

01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:37.016
And be supported.

01:16:37.701 --> 01:16:41.704
Now he receives? To support
for many pel? particles

01:16:41.705 --> 01:16:43.718
if they are indicating me.

01:16:43.719 --> 01:16:46.709
We want to make films
give a lot of money,

01:16:46.710 --> 01:16:49.707
be rich, and finance
the pel? particles art? sticas.

01:16:49.708 --> 01:16:51.724
That was always the model.

01:16:51.725 --> 01:16:56.012
I always wonder:

01:16:56.724 --> 01:16:59.720
? C? Mo can survive
in this environment?

01:16:59.721 --> 01:17:03.717
The margin is very small or.

01:17:03.718 --> 01:17:08.713
With that, and the great interest s
selling pel? particles,

01:17:08.714 --> 01:17:10.705
we must be careful

01:17:10.706 --> 01:17:14.722
or fight hard
to do what you want

01:17:14.723 --> 01:17:19.703
and you think best for the pel? cula.
Fight with all means.

01:17:19.704 --> 01:17:23.725
Often, the fight is civilized
and that makes m? s dif? cult.

01:17:23.726 --> 01:17:24.725
True.

01:17:24.726 --> 01:17:29.002
Because everything boils down to money.

01:17:34.729 --> 01:17:37.704
<I> Never give? No money </ i>

01:17:37.705 --> 01:17:40.029

Any information? N is good.

01:18:04.718 --> 01:18:10.710
If you give me something, what advantage?
to advance my way.

01:18:10.711 --> 01:18:14.704
<I> In the old days,
some were on top </ i>

01:18:14.705 --> 01:18:19.706
and they supported me.
John Calley and many others.

01:18:19.707 --> 01:18:24.706
Not that I believe
they were bad,

01:18:24.707 --> 01:18:27.716
but they were otherwise? little.

01:18:27.717 --> 01:18:31.725
-? How much does it have changed?
- I do not exist.

01:18:31.726 --> 01:18:34.716
Sec? N Scorsese,

01:18:34.717 --> 01:18:37.708
we must learn
make pel? particles for them.

01:18:37.709 --> 01:18:40.709
What happens
It is that we must overcome.

01:18:40.710 --> 01:18:45.706
<I> Quiz? I'm too old now,
but, to make a pel? cula m? s, </ i>

01:18:45.707 --> 01:18:48.711

01:18:51.703 --> 01:18:53.726
You did, and still haci? Ndolo.

01:18:53.727 --> 01:18:56.707
Find new individuals.

01:18:56.708 --> 01:18:58.723
Individuals and new technology? Ace.

01:18:58.724 --> 01:19:01.722
Film is m? S largest
that everything else? s.

01:19:01.723 --> 01:19:07.710
The film really is a way
Art provided by the gods.

01:19:07.711 --> 01:19:13.711
I've seen adults, people
Marty or as my friend George,

01:19:13.712 --> 01:19:17.725
taking two pieces of film
and together in various ways.

01:19:17.726 --> 01:19:24.024
They discover something new, and jump
of joy? to by that magic.

01:19:24.703 --> 01:19:29.699
While this continues? E as ?,
the rest does not matter.

01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:33.728
On the way you find things
for avivarte positively.

01:19:33.729 --> 01:19:38.712
If something in your way, what you reject.
You reject this, that.

01:19:38.713 --> 01:19:41.718
You must follow those impulses,
no m? s.

01:19:41.719 --> 01:19:43.710
Especially with the years.

01:19:43.711 --> 01:19:45.728
? C? Mo is for you
the Cinematograf? to now?

01:19:45.729 --> 01:19:47.029
Okay...

01:19:48.716 --> 01:19:52.724
Dir? It is increasingly
m? s f? easy to do.

01:19:52.725 --> 01:19:58.725
The difficult
It is to get funding.

01:19:58.726 --> 01:20:05.705
I want to use new equipment
to advance and be m? s free.

01:20:05.706 --> 01:20:11.714
Being on set and when
I start to prepare the editing? n,

01:20:11.715 --> 01:20:15.701
Everything flows. I look for simplicity.

01:20:15.702 --> 01:20:20.709
I do not need search
alg? n dazzling effect.

01:20:20.710 --> 01:20:24.701
The current film, thankfully,
no longer category? ace.

01:20:24.702 --> 01:20:25.728
They are not relevant.

01:20:25.729 --> 01:20:31.706
The idea of ​​a flat s? Lido
as Bertolucci or Kubrick,

01:20:31.707 --> 01:20:34.029
in any great film ...

01:20:36.705 --> 01:20:37.728

01:20:37.729 --> 01:20:39.029
S ?.

01:20:39.700 --> 01:20:42.709
They were destroyed.
The plans mean nothing.

01:20:42.710 --> 01:20:43.720
And you get caught.

01:20:43.721 --> 01:20:47.705
You understand that
You started working with video.

01:20:47.706 --> 01:20:48.726
In black and white.

01:20:48.727 --> 01:20:51.029
You never stop learning.

01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:55.001
There are changes f? Musicians,
Things happen.

01:20:57.718 --> 01:21:02.015
But there is a big difference
with great experiences.

01:21:02.702 --> 01:21:06.719
Today in d? To become hogwash.
Excuse t? Rmino.

01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:12.711
I criticize m? same.
Never cheating ?? to anyone.

01:21:12.712 --> 01:21:16.029
And I think, my job sucks.

01:21:16.703 --> 01:21:19.711
Way as a beggar.

01:21:19.712 --> 01:21:23.703
? Why? nobody calls me?
I cross for those phases.

01:21:23.704 --> 01:21:27.719
But in the end,
I am happy working.

01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:33.716
Especially if it is not temporary,
if it's something that values.

01:21:33.717 --> 01:21:36.726
Obviously, you had
health problems.

01:21:36.727 --> 01:21:40.712
It had not made a role as? Cula
10 to? I will because of your back.

01:21:40.713 --> 01:21:47.005
S ?, sounds like something is? I ask.
He was obsessed.

01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:51.719
She could not move my back
and it was strange or.

01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:56.719
I had surgery three times.
He wanted to work. And here? am.

01:21:56.720 --> 01:22:00.700
Each trade? N was worse
and m? s painful.

01:22:00.701 --> 01:22:01.720
My sister pas? because.

01:22:01.721 --> 01:22:05.019
But I discovered? that I can
do pel? particles even as ?.

01:22:05.701 --> 01:22:06.718
<I>? Back? S work? </ I>

01:22:06.719 --> 01:22:09.711
<I> hope to find
another film soon. </ i>

01:22:09.712 --> 01:22:12.726
<I> For 10 years,
I never sent? as well </ i>

<I> and the filmaci? N
"Me and You". </ i>

01:22:16.712 --> 01:22:21.723
I remember shooting
my d? ace O'Malley.

01:22:21.724 --> 01:22:25.704
For years, I had in mind to do

01:22:25.705 --> 01:22:28.728
a film about my childhood
and the occupation of Germany n.

01:22:28.729 --> 01:22:32.715
And found?
the book "The Pianist".

01:22:32.716 --> 01:22:38.706
I watched closely related
my memories

01:22:38.707 --> 01:22:42.726
without it being
my exact knowledge.

01:22:42.727 --> 01:22:47.708
Because it was not
in the ghetto of Krakow,

01:22:47.709 --> 01:22:50.722
but in the Warsaw ghetto.

01:22:50.723 --> 01:22:53.720
Jam? S har? To a pel? Cula
Krakow ghetto.

01:22:53.721 --> 01:22:54.721
? Why ??

01:22:54.722 --> 01:22:56.720
It is very close to my home.

01:22:56.721 --> 01:23:01.705
When you make a pel? Cula
a site, you ruin.

01:23:01.706 --> 01:23:03.722
Because still a memory.

01:23:03.723 --> 01:23:09.015
And are part recueros
important of my life.

01:23:09.711 --> 01:23:13.709
Jam? S har? another film
as successful as "The Godfather".

01:23:13.710 --> 01:23:19.027
That was a fluke.
And I started? something new from scratch.

01:23:19.703 --> 01:23:20.722
It's curious,

01:23:20.723 --> 01:23:25.718
"Twixt" deb? To be funny,
but it came back? would.

01:23:25.719 --> 01:23:30.705
As? the pel? cula
tom? a shift m? s tr? cal.

01:23:30.706 --> 01:23:31.717
He had no at the end.

01:23:31.718 --> 01:23:36.720
In the script, I asked? Poe
cu? l was the end.

01:23:36.721 --> 01:23:37.721
? L replied ?:

01:23:37.722 --> 01:23:42.029
"You want me to tell you?
If I do, there is no return. "

01:23:42.707 --> 01:23:43.722
She did not know for what? He spoke.

01:23:43.723 --> 01:23:48.725
He said: "T you are the end?.
M? Rate and sabr? S what I say. "

01:23:48.726 --> 01:23:52.007
It is time
to face the truth ...

01:23:52.717 --> 01:23:57.016
... To finish the story.
There is no alternative.

01:23:57.729 --> 01:24:01.022
Never admit? ...

01:24:03.719 --> 01:24:06.725

and what I should? be.

01:24:06.726 --> 01:24:09.717
Deb? witness it.
It was a weekend.

... Not There would be happened.

01:24:29.713 --> 01:24:32.009
And you took a drink.

01:24:37.722 --> 01:24:42.027
They shot Sonny
in high. Est? dead.

01:24:48.723 --> 01:24:54.716
An alternative
to our proposal

01:24:54.717 --> 01:24:59.701
is a pel? cula in which
the essential issue is the same.

01:24:59.702 --> 01:25:03.717
The characters, the politics,
sex, past romance.

01:25:03.718 --> 01:25:07.717
All those things,
psicol? logical and emotionally.

01:25:07.718 --> 01:25:08.728
The psychology a.

01:25:08.729 --> 01:25:13.701
But I carried a history

01:25:13.702 --> 01:25:17.713

In other words,

01:25:17.714 --> 01:25:22.710
could? an be two people
who returned from the war

01:25:22.711 --> 01:25:27.720

wherever you want.

01:25:27.721 --> 01:25:32.714
B? Basically,

Run? To within
the financial framework.

Tell cu? Much money to me? S

01:25:54.714 --> 01:25:58.728
Part of the financing? N

but talk about you see? cula,
adventures, cr? regimes,

01:26:35.715 --> 01:26:40.722

From the emotional side
and from the profits.

01:27:11.710 --> 01:27:14.717

Unfathomable depths.

01:32:13.707 --> 01:32:16.725
