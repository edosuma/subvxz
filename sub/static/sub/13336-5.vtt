WEBVTT

00:07.000 --> 00:08.160
We're back.

00:10.200 --> 00:11.600
Let's fucking do this.

00:13.640 --> 00:14.720
Come on!

00:16.600 --> 00:17.680
More pulling.

00:19.040 --> 00:20.680
More getting mortal.

00:21.320 --> 00:23.520
More fights.

00:24.040 --> 00:25.600
Get your fucking hands off me!

00:26.800 --> 00:28.560
Things are about to go crazy.

00:30.240 --> 00:31.720
Let the chaos begin.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.640
We are going to meet
Gary Beadle's girlfriend.

00:35.720 --> 00:37.560
She's absolutely gorgeous.

00:38.480 --> 00:41.200
Gary always said
he was never ready to settle down

00:41.280 --> 00:43.760
but now he is ready
and it isn't with me.

00:43.840 --> 00:46.880
You have never cared about me!
Never!

00:46.960 --> 00:48.760
Charlotte is proper in Gaz's face.

00:52.160 --> 00:54.560
I just feel like
I was never good enough.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.560
All I want to do is put the shit
behind wor and have a friendship.

01:03.680 --> 01:05.840
I should have a degree in pulling.

01:05.920 --> 01:08.240
I'd never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

01:08.320 --> 01:10.440
The hardest graft I've done
is my hair.

01:10.520 --> 01:12.640
I'm a natural beauty.

01:12.720 --> 01:17.080
I'm gonna tear the place up.
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.760
I'm preened to perfection.

01:18.840 --> 01:21.280
I'm cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.

01:21.360 --> 01:25.600
I'm fake, flirty and I've got FFs.
I'm gonna make sparks fly.

01:25.680 --> 01:28.200
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

01:38.600 --> 01:40.520
(Holly)Aaron.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.920
What the hell are you doing in here?

01:43.000 --> 01:44.360
(laughs)

01:47.800 --> 01:49.240
(all laugh)

01:49.320 --> 01:53.000
The girls are giving grief about
sleeping in the bed next to Marnie.

01:53.080 --> 01:55.360
It's harmless.
It's good we're getting on.

01:59.040 --> 02:00.360
(sighs)

02:00.440 --> 02:03.400
Gary brought his new girlfriend
to meet everyone

02:03.480 --> 02:06.440
and Charlotte had the worst night
of her entire life.

02:12.600 --> 02:16.240
This morning I feel like I've had
a weight lifted off my shoulders.

02:16.320 --> 02:19.640
It's nice to have got out things
I've kept inside for so long.

02:22.440 --> 02:25.880
I can't help
but feel still, like...

02:25.960 --> 02:28.160
Angry?
Just a bit like...

02:33.560 --> 02:35.000
I've got no time for Gary.

02:35.080 --> 02:37.560
It's all got to be on his terms
and I'm sick of it.

02:37.640 --> 02:39.880
So I'm making this decision
for myself

02:39.960 --> 02:41.760
and I don't want to speak to him.

02:41.840 --> 02:45.440
I've got no time for the boy.
Not now.

03:03.120 --> 03:05.160
Last night for me
was a massive thing.

03:05.240 --> 03:09.040
Introducing Lillie to everyone.
But not only everyone, Charlotte.

03:09.120 --> 03:12.160
When would you ever introduce
a new girl to your ex girl?

03:12.240 --> 03:13.560
That doesn't happen.

03:19.640 --> 03:22.800
I know it's hard for Charlotte
to think about me moving on

03:22.880 --> 03:24.360
and seeing somebody else.

03:24.440 --> 03:27.680
But hopefully there's
a little bit of closure there for her

03:27.760 --> 03:29.520
and we can slowly move on.

03:31.320 --> 03:32.880
Where's Scott?

03:35.520 --> 03:37.640
Suddenly I realise
Scott is not in bed.

03:37.720 --> 03:40.040
Where the fuck is he?
Why are you in his bed?

03:40.120 --> 03:41.760
He carried us upstairs.

03:41.840 --> 03:46.760
I was hoping to get freaky until
he fell asleep but I didn't know.

03:46.840 --> 03:49.560
I tried to get freaky with Scott
but he was asleep.

03:49.640 --> 03:52.520
What a fucking cheek.
He's not getting any more.

03:52.600 --> 03:53.840
It's over.

03:58.560 --> 04:01.560
I walk downstairs
and I find a note from Scott.

04:01.640 --> 04:04.560
Fuck, everybody needs to read this.
Everyone!

04:05.360 --> 04:08.520
It says, "Oi-oi, listen."

04:08.600 --> 04:11.840
"Something's came up so I need
to nash away for a few weeks."

04:11.920 --> 04:15.480
"Don't miss us too much.
I'll be back ASAP. Love you all."

04:15.560 --> 04:17.000
"PS, clean the house."

04:17.080 --> 04:19.720
It says Scott's gone off
to sort a few things.

04:19.800 --> 04:22.440
I'm more surprised the kid
could write a letter.

04:22.520 --> 04:24.720
He has a mental age
of a three-year-old.

04:28.920 --> 04:32.240
Scott obviously can't handle
how much he's loved it.

04:32.320 --> 04:34.920
He's had to go away
to sort his feelings out.

04:45.640 --> 04:47.560
I'm properly impressed at this.

04:47.640 --> 04:50.720
Thing is, once I start,
it's got to be done properly.

04:50.800 --> 04:53.200
I'm so confused about
what's going on with us.

04:53.280 --> 04:56.640
All this flirting
is bringing back good memories.

04:56.720 --> 04:58.480
I don't know where our head's at.

04:58.560 --> 05:02.080
I do feel like you are more
close and flirty with us

05:02.160 --> 05:03.640
now I've got a boyfriend.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.240
You never gave us
this much attention before.

05:08.640 --> 05:11.240
I feel it's because
you want what you can't have.

05:11.320 --> 05:13.600
I do fancy Marnie
and that's why we flirt.

05:13.680 --> 05:17.480
That doesn't mean I want anything.
I would never go there.

05:17.560 --> 05:20.120
I think that we should try
and not flirt.

05:20.200 --> 05:22.840
It's only harmless though.
It's not fucking...

05:22.920 --> 05:24.760
It's harmless now.

05:31.800 --> 05:35.880
I'm sick of Aaron playing dumb saying
we aren't doing anything wrong.

05:35.960 --> 05:37.640
On paper, he hasn't.

05:37.720 --> 05:41.200
I got a boyfriend though,
all this flirting is going too far.

05:45.800 --> 05:47.320
(doorbell rings)

05:48.240 --> 05:49.240
Hi.

05:52.160 --> 05:54.800
Girls!
Anna's here and this is never good.

05:54.880 --> 05:58.600
She's here to tell us about the
outrageous amount of Botox she's had

05:58.680 --> 06:02.000
or to tell us that
we're going to work. Great.

06:02.080 --> 06:06.960
So tonight, you lot will be taking
Tash-On Tours to another country.

06:07.040 --> 06:08.440
Country?

06:08.520 --> 06:11.720
I'm absolutely buzzing.
We're going to another country!

06:11.800 --> 06:13.360
Where could we be going?

06:13.440 --> 06:15.320
You're going to Bangor in Wales.

06:15.400 --> 06:17.720
Fuck, it is another country,
isn't it?

06:17.800 --> 06:19.880
Eh? But Wales is in England.

06:19.960 --> 06:21.400
Get your bags packed.

06:21.480 --> 06:24.920
From what I've heard, Wales
has got more sheep than people.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.960
Maybe this won't be
so bad after all.

06:27.040 --> 06:28.200
(bleats, laughs)

06:29.480 --> 06:30.880
Let's get packing!

06:36.600 --> 06:37.800
(all laugh)

06:37.880 --> 06:41.280
Everyone is buzzing to go to Bangor.
My first trip away with work

06:41.360 --> 06:43.760
and I've no intention
of being professional.

06:44.880 --> 06:47.080
Our bags are packed,
we're so excited,

06:47.160 --> 06:50.040
get me out of the house
and get me to Bangor!

07:01.280 --> 07:04.160
(both try to pronounce Welsh word)

07:04.240 --> 07:05.600
(all laugh)

07:05.680 --> 07:07.320
Everyone is practising Welsh

07:07.400 --> 07:09.960
but sounds like
they're clearing their throat.

07:12.200 --> 07:14.480
(all exclaim, laugh)

07:14.560 --> 07:17.360
Kyle is trying so hard
to speak Welsh,

07:17.440 --> 07:20.720
he spat all over his shoulder.
Rank.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.520
The Welsh are known for castles,
everybody in Wales has a castle

07:33.600 --> 07:36.080
so I guess we're gonna
be staying in a castle.

07:37.560 --> 07:40.920
Oh, what?! What the fuck?!

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Anna, are you fucking
having a laugh?

07:43.080 --> 07:44.400
It's a caravan!

07:51.280 --> 07:52.720
I am fucking devastated.

07:52.800 --> 07:55.120
There'll be no banging
in Bangor tonight.

07:55.200 --> 07:57.880
I can barely swing a cat in here,
never mind my cock.

08:00.560 --> 08:05.360
It's minus degrees, there's only
one teeny-weeny fireplace.

08:05.440 --> 08:08.200
Me own shit would project
more heat than that.

08:12.880 --> 08:14.840
Tonight we are going international.

08:14.920 --> 08:18.040
We're hitting Bangor
and we are gonna fuck shit up.

08:22.280 --> 08:23.640
To the bus!

08:32.960 --> 08:35.600
We get to the bar
and the crowd are already there.

08:35.680 --> 08:37.280
Let's get the singles mortal.

08:45.760 --> 08:47.960
(attempts to repeat Welsh)

08:48.040 --> 08:51.880
Bangor is a quiet town but tonight
this lot are pulling out the stops.

08:51.960 --> 08:54.120
Work is wicked.

08:58.560 --> 09:00.640
It's me versus Chloe.

09:00.720 --> 09:04.000
Head-to-head, mano-to-mano,
sheepo-to-sheepo.

09:04.080 --> 09:05.880
Go!

09:07.560 --> 09:10.560
I am bossing this. This girl
is having the time of her life.

09:10.640 --> 09:13.800
Limbs are flying everywhere.
Chloe, watch and take note.

09:13.880 --> 09:16.200
Four, three...

09:20.760 --> 09:23.600
I can't believe Nathan knows
this many sex positions.

09:23.680 --> 09:27.440
Chloe's gonna have to pull something
out the bag.Three, two, one!

09:30.320 --> 09:32.000
This game is fucking easy.

09:32.080 --> 09:35.120
All I've got to do
is go over my normal repertoire.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.760
I don't know what's come over Chloe,
she's possessed.

09:42.840 --> 09:44.800
She's riding him like a rodeo.

09:56.560 --> 09:59.000
I'm not gonna lie,
I'm genuinely annoyed.

09:59.080 --> 10:01.560
Chloe only won
because the bitch is horny.

10:05.520 --> 10:07.120
We're here for Tash-On Tours

10:07.200 --> 10:10.440
and it's about time
someone started tashing on.

10:19.520 --> 10:21.480
Tash-On Tours is so good tonight.

10:21.560 --> 10:24.360
Everyone is just pissed
and having such a good time.

10:29.200 --> 10:31.160
Work was absolutely fucking mint.

10:31.240 --> 10:34.360
We're all mortal but now
it's time to show these Welshies

10:34.440 --> 10:36.480
how to proper party, Geordie-style.

10:41.040 --> 10:44.080
Work's done, now we're off
to the club to get hammered.

11:00.520 --> 11:03.800
Me and Kyle have been getting along
so well since our chat.

11:03.880 --> 11:07.080
I feel we might have turned a corner
in our non-relationship.

11:16.840 --> 11:18.360
We've hit a turning point.

11:18.440 --> 11:21.320
I want to let her know
how much she means to us.

11:24.720 --> 11:26.720
Kyle is like most men
on this planet,

11:26.800 --> 11:28.320
he doesn't say how he feels.

11:28.400 --> 11:31.120
So when he does say I'm
the best thing to happen to him,

11:31.200 --> 11:32.640
that means so much to me.

11:38.240 --> 11:42.200
I'm pretending I'm in a music video
and I'm busting out my best moves.

11:44.680 --> 11:46.640
I'm not sure what Chloe's doing

11:46.720 --> 11:50.040
but looks like she's having
a dance-off with herself.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.440
If I wasn't around Aaron,
I wouldn't be tempted

12:09.520 --> 12:12.360
but I can't get away
and he won't leave us alone.

12:27.880 --> 12:30.320
What Marnie needs to realise
is I did like her

12:30.400 --> 12:33.720
but she got a boyfriend
and there's nothing I can do.

12:44.840 --> 12:46.520
I'm so confused over Aaron.

12:46.600 --> 12:49.280
He's acting the way
I always wanted him to act.

12:49.360 --> 12:52.320
If he'd acted like this last time,
it would have worked.

13:01.640 --> 13:05.200
I've lost count the amount of times
we've tried to make this work.

13:05.280 --> 13:08.040
I don't know if it's the house
but whatever reason,

13:08.120 --> 13:09.320
it's not meant to be.

13:18.760 --> 13:20.480
I feel like Aaron's play thing.

13:20.560 --> 13:23.920
It was always more to me than that
and it still is now.

13:30.560 --> 13:34.000
There's obviously something there
cos every time I walk away,

13:34.080 --> 13:36.480
I keep going back.
But we don't work.

13:44.160 --> 13:46.920
He knows I wanted something
to happen and he didn't.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.080
It's so frustrating
how things can flip so quickly.

13:55.560 --> 13:58.760
I'm foaming here.
I can't argue with a fucking idiot.

13:58.840 --> 14:00.880
She's talking utter shit.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.160
(glass smashing)

14:04.240 --> 14:08.040
What the fuck is that idiot doing?
Smashing a glass?

14:08.120 --> 14:10.640
Thought you haven't
done anything wrong.

14:10.720 --> 14:13.920
One minute we're getting on
and the next minute,

14:14.000 --> 14:17.240
Aaron's hoying jugs around
and punching glasses.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.000
Tonight has been a disaster.

14:21.080 --> 14:23.720
Me and Marnie argued,
I'm getting out of here.

14:28.120 --> 14:30.120
Everyone's left the club in tatters

14:30.200 --> 14:33.200
and we've got to go
to the shitty caravans.

14:33.280 --> 14:35.400
Things are only getting worse.

14:48.040 --> 14:52.080
I do feel for Aaron because he's got
a very pretty girl flirting with him

14:52.160 --> 14:55.160
who's got a boyfriend
but he can't do anything.

15:01.320 --> 15:04.480
I literally don't have a fucking clue
what I'm doing.

15:04.560 --> 15:06.360
I'm trying to stay angry at Aaron

15:06.440 --> 15:09.440
but it's so hard
because he always wins us over.

15:16.840 --> 15:20.240
I don't know how two people
can go from screaming at each other

15:20.320 --> 15:21.720
to flirting and kissing.

15:24.360 --> 15:27.600
Oh, my God. I'm kissing Aaron.
I'm getting carried away.

15:27.680 --> 15:30.520
And I can't stop myself.

15:32.920 --> 15:36.720
Aaron necking on with Marnie,
I really don't get these two.

15:36.800 --> 15:39.200
One minute
they're at each other's throats

15:39.280 --> 15:42.360
and the next,
they're IN each other's throats.

15:48.520 --> 15:51.920
I've kissed Aaron and we're
still flirting with each other.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.680
This can only lead to trouble.

15:57.320 --> 15:59.640
I must be drunk,
Marnie's got a boyfriend.

15:59.720 --> 16:00.800
What am I doing?

16:03.480 --> 16:06.680
I've agreed that Aaron
can stop in my bed as friends.

16:06.760 --> 16:09.120
Who am I kidding?
This isn't gonna end well.

16:11.720 --> 16:14.360
I'm that drunk I don't even know
what's going on.

16:14.440 --> 16:18.280
Marnie's kissing us
and her hands are all over us.

16:21.360 --> 16:25.520
I'm so into Aaron, I'm not even
thinking about Dan. I'm awful.

16:29.960 --> 16:32.360
(groans)

16:32.440 --> 16:36.600
I've had too much to drink, I'm
feeling sick, I've got to go to bed.

16:47.360 --> 16:49.920
Aaron has resisted Marnie
for a long time.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.800
There's only so much you can take
before you crack.

16:58.880 --> 17:01.720
Gary comes over to help me
make my bed for me and Holly

17:01.800 --> 17:05.480
and I do what all good friends do,
grass up Aaron for necking on.

17:12.360 --> 17:17.520
Knowing Aaron, he is gonna
regret this so much in the morning.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.600
It's absolutely freezing
in this caravan

17:27.680 --> 17:30.920
and there's only one way
me and Holly know to warm up.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.120
(moaning, panting)

17:35.880 --> 17:38.680
I feel so sorry for all the boys
in the caravan tonight

17:38.760 --> 17:41.000
and anyone within a five-mile radius

17:41.080 --> 17:44.440
because no-one is getting
any sleep tonight.

17:45.880 --> 17:47.320
Fucking great.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.400
Kyle and Holly are fucking banging.

17:49.480 --> 17:52.640
It's that loud I feel like
I'm in the room with them.

18:02.560 --> 18:04.400
Well, you know what they say.

18:04.480 --> 18:07.240
If the caravan's a-rocking,
don't come a-knocking.

18:07.320 --> 18:08.680
(crashing)

18:26.320 --> 18:29.680
I've woke up in Marnie's bed,
what the fuck is going on?

18:29.760 --> 18:31.640
I need to get out of here quick.

18:33.600 --> 18:36.720
The first thing I do is go and find
Gaz in the shower block

18:36.800 --> 18:38.600
to piece together what went on.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.280
The more Gaz is telling us,
the more I remember.

18:50.360 --> 18:52.280
Fuck me, it's not sounding good.

18:58.120 --> 19:00.440
Aaron says he remembers
kissing Marnie,

19:00.520 --> 19:02.680
but he was that pissed,

19:02.760 --> 19:05.840
he wouldn't remember
if Marnie tried to bang him.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.760
I can't believe what I've done.

19:17.840 --> 19:19.880
Not only have I went back on my word,

19:19.960 --> 19:22.080
I've fucked things up
for her and Dan.

19:22.160 --> 19:24.880
And that's exactly
what I didn't want.

19:30.960 --> 19:33.240
I've woken up feeling pretty wicked.

19:33.320 --> 19:35.960
It must have been the caravan sex
I had last night.

19:36.040 --> 19:39.400
Morning, Mum and Dad.
(laughs)

19:39.480 --> 19:42.600
One person who is not feeling
so great is Nathan

19:42.680 --> 19:45.080
who probably had
about 3.5 minutes sleep.

19:45.160 --> 19:48.920
I heard everything.
I felt like I was in the room.

19:52.200 --> 19:53.520
I thought I was quiet.

20:00.520 --> 20:04.080
It was so obvious that Aaron
was gonna get into Marnie.

20:04.160 --> 20:08.720
They've got so much chemistry, they
can't keep away from each other.

20:08.800 --> 20:10.560
Eh, God. I don't know.

20:12.960 --> 20:16.920
Marnie is gonna have to tell
her boyfriend what she's done.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.560
I would hate to be Marnie.

20:27.120 --> 20:29.320
Erm... like...

20:32.080 --> 20:33.360
(sighs)

20:33.440 --> 20:34.800
Oh, God.

20:34.880 --> 20:39.000
I've woke up and I don't think I've
ever felt this bad in my entire life.

20:39.080 --> 20:41.400
I can't believe
I kissed Aaron last night.

20:41.480 --> 20:44.000
It was the one thing
I was trying so hard not to do.

20:44.080 --> 20:47.720
(sobs)
It's OK. You're only human.

20:47.800 --> 20:50.440
It's bound to happen
in this situation.

20:50.520 --> 20:52.640
But Dan doesn't deserve that.

20:52.720 --> 20:55.680
You're only guilty
of having feelings for Aaron.

20:55.760 --> 20:58.120
At one point
I wanted to be with Aaron.

20:58.200 --> 21:03.280
How dare he just fuck
everything up with me and Dan?

21:03.360 --> 21:07.160
I feel so bad for Marnie.
Aaron has lead her on from day one

21:07.240 --> 21:09.400
and acted
as if he's still interested

21:09.480 --> 21:13.200
even though she's got a boyfriend.
What are you going to do?

21:13.280 --> 21:16.760
I'm gonna tell him
I don't want him to speak to us.

21:18.280 --> 21:20.680
Aaron is in the wrong but so am I.

21:20.760 --> 21:22.400
I need to take responsibility

21:22.480 --> 21:24.520
for hurting someone
that I care about.

21:29.720 --> 21:32.760
The last think Marnie wants today
is to bump into Aaron

21:32.840 --> 21:35.520
so I decide to take to the girls
on a little activity

21:35.600 --> 21:38.120
to take her mind
off cheating on her boyfriend.

21:50.360 --> 21:54.480
I've gone to see Gary, Aaron and
Nathan, the others have fucked off.

22:03.800 --> 22:05.320
Everyone has done a runner

22:05.400 --> 22:08.840
so we're gonna see
what Wales has got to offer.

22:22.400 --> 22:26.240
What better way to take Aaron's
mind off things than crabbing.

22:34.360 --> 22:35.360
(shrieks)

22:44.280 --> 22:45.360
Gary's got a cheek.

22:45.440 --> 22:49.200
The amount of lasses he's shagged,
must be like crab hotel down there.

23:07.280 --> 23:10.520
I thought today was supposed
to be taking my mind off things

23:10.600 --> 23:13.960
but all everyone can talk about
is what happened with Marnie.

23:14.040 --> 23:15.480
Fuck.

23:20.160 --> 23:22.120
We are going trampolining in a cave.

23:22.200 --> 23:24.680
Charlotte is terrified
of small spaces.

23:24.760 --> 23:27.680
Which probably explains
why she's got a baggy fanny.

23:32.080 --> 23:36.400
This place sounds scary as fuck.
I'm so nervous.

23:36.480 --> 23:39.240
This is so good.

23:41.360 --> 23:42.800
(groans)

23:44.640 --> 23:46.360
I'm actually buzzing for this.

23:46.440 --> 23:49.680
We're going in tiny little caves
to bounce on trampolines.

23:49.760 --> 23:50.920
It sounds wicked.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.080
(screams)

23:56.840 --> 23:58.800
Oh! No!

24:03.600 --> 24:05.800
I know how to get them
out of this fear.

24:05.880 --> 24:08.680
Just bounce around them in a circle
and make them cry.

24:11.120 --> 24:13.320
Why is Kyle making this
ten times worse?

24:13.400 --> 24:15.600
If I could catch him,
I would knock him out.

24:18.040 --> 24:21.200
That's what you've got to go down.

24:21.280 --> 24:22.600
Fuck it, I'm game.

24:27.120 --> 24:28.600
That was fucking mint!

24:28.680 --> 24:30.880
(screams)

24:33.400 --> 24:35.640
(screams)

24:35.720 --> 24:39.040
Thank God Kyle rescues me
like a knight in shining armour.

24:41.200 --> 24:42.400
See you later, pet.

24:42.480 --> 24:46.320
(screams)

24:50.080 --> 24:52.520
I never thought I was scared
of nets and caves

24:52.600 --> 24:55.640
but after going through that,
I could take on anything.

24:55.720 --> 24:57.720
Except mushrooms. I hate mushrooms.

24:59.200 --> 25:00.320
That was mint.

25:00.400 --> 25:03.480
Today has been wicked
but now I've to get on that bus

25:03.560 --> 25:05.800
and see Aaron
and I'm fucking dreading it.

25:11.320 --> 25:13.560
Seeing Aaron
has made us feel horrendous.

25:13.640 --> 25:15.920
I can't look at him,
I can't speak to him.

25:16.000 --> 25:20.120
I want to get back to Newcastle
and forget that Bangor ever existed.

25:24.640 --> 25:28.240
I've been on some awkward journeys
but this coach takes the piss.

25:28.320 --> 25:31.600
Me and Marnie haven't spoken
to each other since this morning.

25:35.560 --> 25:38.440
Me and the girls are buzzing
to be back in Newcastle.

25:38.520 --> 25:40.360
Time to get ready and go out.

25:47.120 --> 25:50.080
Tonight we need to forget
about the arguments we had

25:50.160 --> 25:52.880
and try for once
to have a wicked night.

25:52.960 --> 25:53.960
Let's hit the Toon.

26:03.080 --> 26:05.560
Thank fuck Gaz starts us off
with tequilas.

26:05.640 --> 26:07.880
A bit of Dutch courage
is what I need.

26:12.160 --> 26:14.520
I need to talk to Marnie
as soon as possible

26:14.600 --> 26:16.640
but I am absolutely shitting myself.

26:27.800 --> 26:30.800
There's absolutely no way
me and Aaron can be friends.

26:30.880 --> 26:34.160
We can be civil, we can't speak,
because look where it led us.

26:45.320 --> 26:48.720
I'm testing Aaron by asking him
if he thinks I should tell Dan.

26:48.800 --> 26:52.400
I'm hoping that he says no so that
all this flirting he's been doing

26:52.480 --> 26:53.640
is for a reason.

27:01.480 --> 27:05.120
If there was a time for Aaron to
prove that he's got feelings for us,

27:05.200 --> 27:07.520
it would be now to stop us
from going to Dan,

27:07.600 --> 27:09.760
but the fact that he's just sat there

27:09.840 --> 27:12.960
proves he's done all this
for no reason at all.

27:26.160 --> 27:29.000
Me and Charlotte are talking
about Aaron and Marnie

27:29.080 --> 27:31.960
and we want them to make up
because the house is awkward.

27:37.200 --> 27:40.520
In this situation, Gary is
always going to have Aaron's back

27:40.600 --> 27:44.360
and I'll always have Marnie's,
so we'll have to agree to disagree.

27:55.400 --> 27:57.320
Of course Gary wants to be friends,

27:57.400 --> 28:00.640
cos then he can have a laugh with me
when he's inside the house

28:00.720 --> 28:02.600
and when he gets out, he has Lillie.

28:02.680 --> 28:05.200
I don't want to be part
of your convenient plan.

28:05.280 --> 28:06.760
It's not convenient for me.

28:20.240 --> 28:25.520
I've gone from a nice conversation
with Charlotte to her going berserk.

28:33.760 --> 28:36.400
She's still acting like this
cos she still cares

28:36.480 --> 28:38.200
but she'll never admit that.

28:42.600 --> 28:44.040
That's it, I'm done.

28:44.120 --> 28:47.880
I don't wanna hear one more dribble
of shit that comes out of his mouth.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.000
We're not talking.

28:58.640 --> 29:02.120
I can feel Marnie and Charlotte
burning daggers into our heads.

29:02.200 --> 29:03.400
But fuck them.

29:06.960 --> 29:09.880
The word "disaster"
does not come close to tonight.

29:09.960 --> 29:11.640
Get me home and get me to bed.

29:18.080 --> 29:21.080
I'm going to bed.
I don't want to be around anyone.

29:23.560 --> 29:29.160
This night out has been the world's
worst night out in history.

29:46.600 --> 29:48.920
If the girls don't want
to talk to us, fine.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.360
I dealt with them before
and I'll do it again.

29:57.680 --> 30:01.640
When I've got a girlfriend,
I don't look at anyone else.

30:01.720 --> 30:04.840
She's window-shopping
on someone else's card.

30:14.800 --> 30:17.960
My head is just all over the place.

30:18.040 --> 30:19.800
I don't even know how I feel.

30:19.880 --> 30:23.000
There is nothing more hard
than juggling a relationship

30:23.080 --> 30:24.480
and being in that house.

30:24.560 --> 30:26.920
I've not got what it takes
to do it any more.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.840
Do you feel like the thing
with Aaron was a mistake

30:29.920 --> 30:32.760
or do you feel like
there was something more there?

30:32.840 --> 30:35.040
It was a mistake
because I'm with Dan.

30:35.120 --> 30:37.720
But it happened because
there's feelings there.

30:37.800 --> 30:41.760
It's not a crime to have feelings
for two people at the same time.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.840
Marnie's right,
you can't choose who you like.

30:44.920 --> 30:46.680
Yes, she might have a boyfriend

30:46.760 --> 30:49.200
but she's also got strong feelings
for Aaron

30:49.280 --> 30:50.720
and that must be confusing.

30:55.040 --> 30:56.680
(doorbell rings)

30:58.640 --> 31:02.600
The doorbell rings and there's a kid
there with some flowers for Marnie.

31:02.680 --> 31:04.720
Shit.
Marnie!

31:08.440 --> 31:09.480
Oh, my God.

31:09.560 --> 31:11.720
Nathan walked in
with a bunch of roses.

31:11.800 --> 31:14.960
I know straight away they're
from Dan. I feel horrific.

31:19.600 --> 31:22.080
Oh, my God.

31:23.160 --> 31:25.000
Fuck Marnie's life.

31:25.080 --> 31:29.240
What are the chances of him sending
flowers the day after you cheat?

31:38.000 --> 31:42.360
If I wasn't sure, I am sure now.
I need to speak to Dan.

31:47.960 --> 31:51.960
Marnie stands up and tells wor
she's leaving the house for a while.

31:52.040 --> 31:55.200
That means I won't go anywhere
near her if she's not here.

31:55.280 --> 31:56.280
See youse later.

31:59.280 --> 32:01.400
I'm so anxious about seeing Dan.

32:01.480 --> 32:04.880
I don't know what he's gonna say
when he finds out what I've done.

32:04.960 --> 32:08.200
I'm gonna be as honest as I can
and hopefully he will forgive us.

32:19.360 --> 32:20.520
(phone ringing)

32:22.840 --> 32:25.000
Hello?
"Hi, Charlotte."

32:25.080 --> 32:26.120
Hi, Anna.

32:27.480 --> 32:30.520
It was really good,
we had a really good time.

32:33.760 --> 32:36.280
Oh, yeah. That happened, too.

32:36.360 --> 32:40.080
Anna is on the phone and is furious
about what Aaron did in Bangor.

32:40.160 --> 32:45.520
She's punishing me, Kyle, Chloe
and Aaron by sending us to work.

32:45.600 --> 32:47.160
What the fuck did I do?

32:47.240 --> 32:50.000
It's a bar crawl
for a 25th birthday party.

32:50.080 --> 32:52.200
All girls.
All girls, Charlotte?

32:52.280 --> 32:53.440
All girls.

32:55.360 --> 32:58.880
Anna calls and she's sending us
to a 25th girl's birthday party.

32:58.960 --> 33:02.000
Normally that would feel like
it was my birthday party,

33:02.080 --> 33:04.600
but because I've got Holly,
I'm in trouble.

33:10.800 --> 33:13.800
I understand that it's Kyle's job
to go and entertain

33:13.880 --> 33:17.000
and flirt but it doesn't mean
I'm gonna be happy about it.

33:22.680 --> 33:25.360
Kyle hasn't done anything wrong...
yet.

33:25.440 --> 33:29.560
But my eyes will always be on him
and he needs to know that.

33:40.440 --> 33:44.240
It's work tonight, it's
a Tash-On Tours 25th birthday party.

33:44.320 --> 33:46.640
Should be interesting.
Charlotte, Chloe!

33:52.880 --> 33:55.520
(cheering)

33:57.280 --> 33:59.920
We arrive at work and these girls
are well up for it.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.960
This will be harder than I thought.

34:05.920 --> 34:07.680
(cheering)

34:13.160 --> 34:15.480
Tonight at work,
we're actually buzzing.

34:15.560 --> 34:17.760
We're drinking,
the girls are loving it.

34:21.880 --> 34:24.960
Happy birthday.
Thank you.

34:25.040 --> 34:27.560
I go to give to birthday girl
a kiss on the cheek

34:27.640 --> 34:29.800
and I end up
kissing her on the lips.

34:29.880 --> 34:31.640
Thank fuck Charlotte didn't see.

34:31.720 --> 34:34.240
She'd be back to teacher
with her kiss report.

34:41.680 --> 34:45.720
I've been watching Kyle all night
and so far, so good.

34:45.800 --> 34:47.720
But the night is still young.

34:54.480 --> 34:55.560
(cheering)

34:56.160 --> 34:59.880
Me, Nathan and Gary
are ready to hit Powerhouse hard.

35:05.800 --> 35:08.840
Tonight we're in Powerhouse
and I'm in my comfort zone.

35:08.920 --> 35:11.680
Let the games begin.

35:16.240 --> 35:18.160
Next on the bar crawl
is Tiger Tiger.

35:18.240 --> 35:20.040
Let's keep this party going.

35:22.480 --> 35:23.960
Work is going off.

35:24.040 --> 35:27.120
Everyone is having a mint time
and the girls are loving it.

35:27.200 --> 35:28.200
Probably too much.

35:31.600 --> 35:35.280
Kyle is over there standing
talking to girls. What the fuck?!

35:38.560 --> 35:42.600
I'm going over and I'm going over
to stop this behaviour right now.

35:46.080 --> 35:48.960
Oh, look, here comes Charlotte,
the fun police,

35:49.040 --> 35:52.640
to ruin my day and ruin work.
Thank you.

36:03.160 --> 36:07.400
No, I don't have to touch the girls
to do my job, but it does help.

36:28.960 --> 36:32.640
Holly is the one I want to be with
so these numbers mean nothing to me.

36:32.720 --> 36:35.440
Sorry, girls, but 0191-do one.

36:40.600 --> 36:42.400
I don't believe what I'm seeing.

36:42.480 --> 36:45.720
Kyle has ripped them up. What are
you doing? I'd have had them.

36:50.360 --> 36:54.240
Work's done and we're off
to Powerhouse to meet the others.

37:01.440 --> 37:03.960
Get to Powerhouse,
they've got drinks in.

37:04.040 --> 37:06.040
Time to get fucking mortal.

37:13.960 --> 37:17.520
The workers are back,
I'm hoping Kyle behaved himself.

37:25.080 --> 37:28.000
I am so relieved that Kyle
didn't do anything at work.

37:28.080 --> 37:31.200
I don't know why
I get myself so worked up.

37:38.240 --> 37:41.040
Me and Kyle are catching up with Gaz.

37:51.200 --> 37:53.640
I can't believe
Kyle got two numbers at work.

37:53.720 --> 37:56.720
Even if he did rip them up,
Holly will still go mental.

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
It doesn't take long
for me to find a good-looking lad.

38:08.080 --> 38:10.760
This blond-haired beauty
came out of nowhere.

38:15.760 --> 38:19.120
This lad doesn't move slow.
We go from drinking to tashing on.

38:19.200 --> 38:20.200
Buzzin'.

38:23.880 --> 38:26.360
I'm on the dance floor
no more than three seconds

38:26.440 --> 38:29.520
and I've spotted a fitty.
I'm not wasting no time tonight.

38:30.960 --> 38:34.600
Aaron's enjoying the freedom
because as soon as Marnie's not here,

38:34.680 --> 38:36.680
he's actually going on the pull.

38:36.760 --> 38:39.000
Never been happier.
I love Powerhouse.

38:44.520 --> 38:46.640
I haven't had a chance
to speak to Kyle.

38:46.720 --> 38:49.520
All he's been doing
is hanging around with the lads

38:49.600 --> 38:52.920
and if he hasn't done anything
wrong, why is he ignoring us?

38:53.000 --> 38:57.360
The more pissed I'm getting,
the more paranoid it's making me.

39:10.240 --> 39:13.480
Why can't Kyle realise I haven't
felt like this about anyone

39:13.560 --> 39:14.600
in such a long time?

39:14.680 --> 39:18.480
Every time he goes to work, I wanna
crawl inside myself and disappear.

39:27.600 --> 39:30.960
The reason Holly gets jealous
is because when I first met her

39:31.040 --> 39:34.040
and I first got with her,
I used to sleep with other girls.

39:34.120 --> 39:35.960
She's got to realise I've changed.

39:41.200 --> 39:43.680
On what planet
does Kyle actually think

39:43.760 --> 39:46.960
that I would be OK with him
getting girls' numbers at work?

39:53.880 --> 39:57.160
I can't deal with any more
arguments. I'm at my wit's end.

39:57.240 --> 39:59.960
All I want to do now is forget
this night and get home.

40:10.840 --> 40:13.200
Me and this lad
arrive back at the house

40:13.280 --> 40:17.280
and there's only one place to go.
Shag pad!

40:20.680 --> 40:22.240
I'm not fucking about.

40:22.320 --> 40:26.560
I'm getting naked, getting in that
bed and getting in that lad's mouth.

40:33.200 --> 40:35.360
I want to sort things out
with Holly.

40:35.440 --> 40:39.200
I don't wanna let this argument
ruin another night.

40:43.360 --> 40:46.080
I know this is just me
being drunk and paranoid

40:46.160 --> 40:49.080
but right now me and Kyle
are back to square one.

40:49.160 --> 40:51.040
This is just exhausting.

40:51.120 --> 40:52.240
(sobs)

40:55.480 --> 40:58.320
Holly doesn't realise
that she makes us happy.

40:58.400 --> 41:00.840
She always goes on,
she wants us to be happy.

41:00.920 --> 41:02.320
I'm happiest with her.

41:18.080 --> 41:20.760
I'm starting to feel really freaky.

41:20.840 --> 41:25.080
Then for some stupid fucking reason,
I start to tell him a story.

41:33.800 --> 41:35.760
(both chant) Nathan, Nathan, Nathan!

41:35.840 --> 41:38.240
Me and Charlotte
are gonna leave Nathan to it.

41:38.320 --> 41:40.880
We're both pissed
so we're off to bed.

41:47.200 --> 41:50.320
I felt like I was in a fairy-tale
and I got my happy ending.

41:50.400 --> 41:52.600
Cheers, Prince Charming.

41:52.680 --> 41:54.360
Oh, fuck!

41:55.400 --> 41:58.000
(laughs)

42:22.200 --> 42:22.400
.
