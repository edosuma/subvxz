- Previously on <i>awkward...</i>

00:03.771 --> 00:04.536
- You broke up? When?

00:04.538 --> 00:07.906
- When I realized I wanted to
be with someone more like you.

00:07.908 --> 00:10.175
- You said you were
never embarrassed of me.

00:10.177 --> 00:12.177
- I lied.
- You're 16.

00:12.179 --> 00:14.146
If there's ever
a time to be selfish,

00:14.148 --> 00:15.748
It's now.

00:19.319 --> 00:20.619
- Hey.

00:24.991 --> 00:28.660
- It had been 31 hours--
minus the 2 I could sleep--

00:28.662 --> 00:31.063
Of significant self-loathing.

00:31.065 --> 00:32.698
I had cheated
on my boyfriend.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.533
And with time travel
off the table

00:34.535 --> 00:35.868
To undo the dirty deed,

00:35.870 --> 00:36.568
I had to take control

00:36.570 --> 00:39.671
And ensure it would
never happen again.

00:39.673 --> 00:42.941
Get in.

00:44.344 --> 00:46.278
What happened
last Friday was wrong.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.147
- Agreed.

00:48.149 --> 00:48.981
- I love matty.
- I know.

00:48.983 --> 00:50.849
- And it is not right to hurt
the people you love.

00:50.851 --> 00:52.184
- Couldn't agree more.
- So it's done.

00:52.186 --> 00:53.585
- It's done.
- Just to clarify,

00:53.587 --> 00:55.788
The "it" means "we."
<i>we</i> are done.

00:55.790 --> 00:56.722
- Clarified.
- Good.

00:56.724 --> 00:57.623
- Great.
See you in class.

00:57.625 --> 01:00.526
- Bye.

01:46.606 --> 01:47.739

you just saw that.

01:47.741 --> 01:50.609
- I can't believe
you just did that.

01:50.611 --> 01:51.677
This is bonky kong.

01:51.679 --> 01:53.479
Your collin dalliance
was supposed to be

01:53.481 --> 01:54.613
A one-time special event,

01:54.615 --> 01:56.281
Like if I saw five erections

01:56.283 --> 01:58.083
From one direction
in my direction.

01:58.085 --> 01:59.685
You said you were just
living in the moment

01:59.687 --> 02:00.819
And that the kiss
meant nothing.

02:00.821 --> 02:01.920
- It didn't mean anything.

02:01.922 --> 02:03.689
- Then why did
you do it again?

02:03.691 --> 02:04.323
- I don't know.

02:04.325 --> 02:07.259
- Jenna, once is an accident,
twice is an affair.

02:07.261 --> 02:08.060
- I was trying to end it.

02:08.062 --> 02:09.595
- By shoving your face
into his?

02:09.597 --> 02:11.296
- Things got out of control.

02:11.298 --> 02:12.831
- I know.
I saw.

02:12.833 --> 02:14.266
So now,
you have two choices:

02:14.268 --> 02:16.301
Either end it with collin
or tell matty.

02:16.303 --> 02:18.103
- Oh, I've tried the first one,
and that's not working.

02:18.105 --> 02:20.072
And the second option
is never gonna happen.

02:20.074 --> 02:22.040
- Then it's all
about option three.

02:22.042 --> 02:23.075
- There's a third?
- Yeah.

02:23.077 --> 02:24.376
And it entails
me telling matty

02:24.378 --> 02:25.444
Because I can't
keep a secret.

02:25.446 --> 02:27.346
So if you don't choose
option "a" or "b" soon,

02:27.348 --> 02:28.680
Option "c" might not
be an option

02:28.682 --> 02:30.682
But rather
a foregone conclusion.

02:30.684 --> 02:32.851
Jenna, holding on
to a secret this big

02:32.853 --> 02:34.419
Runs the risk
of secret leakage.

02:34.421 --> 02:34.853
- What?

02:34.855 --> 02:35.988
- You know,
when little secrets

02:35.990 --> 02:37.189
Spring up and out
in my attempt

02:37.191 --> 02:38.490
To hold down
the big one.

02:38.492 --> 02:39.057
Help me, jenna.

02:39.059 --> 02:40.492
If you don't fix this,
I might explode,

02:40.494 --> 02:43.428
And there is no telling
how many lives I might ruin.

02:43.430 --> 02:45.264
- Your secret is safe.

02:45.266 --> 02:46.865
I am amazing at secrets.

02:46.867 --> 02:49.434
- I'm not, and I'm even worse
with surprises.

02:49.436 --> 02:50.936
- Aren't they
the same thing?

02:50.938 --> 02:52.938
- No.
Maybe.

02:52.940 --> 02:53.405
Yes!

02:53.407 --> 02:55.707
Oh, damn it, how am I
gonna pull this off?

02:55.709 --> 02:59.144
I have been trying to throw
a surprise party for jenna

02:59.146 --> 03:00.379
Since she was three.

03:00.381 --> 03:01.613
And for whatever reason,

03:01.615 --> 03:04.249
She always manages
to find out.

03:04.251 --> 03:08.554
Mm, I ordered them
for your surprise party.

03:08.556 --> 03:09.354
Shit.

03:09.356 --> 03:13.492
You can wear it
for your surprise party.

03:13.494 --> 03:16.261
Shit.

03:16.263 --> 03:17.729
Shit.

03:17.731 --> 03:20.799
The only surprise I've
ever pulled off for jenna

03:20.801 --> 03:23.068
Was redoing her room
for her 16th birthday.

03:23.070 --> 03:25.637
- And the real surprise there
was that she left it redone

03:25.639 --> 03:29.708
As long as she did, oof.

03:29.710 --> 03:33.645
- I really wanna pull off
her party this year.

03:33.647 --> 03:34.613
Can you help?

03:34.615 --> 03:35.714
- Can I help?

03:35.716 --> 03:38.183
My middle name isn't "ta-da"
for nothing.

03:38.185 --> 03:40.686
Actually, it wasn't
my given name.

03:40.688 --> 03:42.621
I rocked it in college
when I worked at a gay bar

03:42.623 --> 03:46.358
And I would show off
my man boobs for extra cash.

03:46.360 --> 03:47.226
- Interesting.
- It was.

03:47.228 --> 03:51.330
I mean, who knew gay men wanted
to see boobs on a dude?

03:51.332 --> 03:52.064
- But you're not a dude.

03:52.066 --> 03:55.634
- Exactly, which is why
it was such a great scam.

03:55.636 --> 03:59.271
Cha-ching, cha-ching,
cha-ching-ching.

03:59.273 --> 04:03.242
Cha-ching.

04:03.244 --> 04:04.910
- So Friday!

04:04.912 --> 04:06.778
Can you keep jenna busy
after school

04:06.780 --> 04:09.281
So everyone can get
to the house and hide?

04:09.283 --> 04:10.315
- You got it, l-dog.

04:10.317 --> 04:12.451
I will take our girl
to my favorite dive bar,

04:12.453 --> 04:17.022
Put a little hair on her chest,
and then drop her off.

04:17.024 --> 04:20.425
Or we can paint mugs
at color me mine

04:20.427 --> 04:22.561
And then head over.

04:22.563 --> 04:24.129
- I was lost in thought.

04:24.131 --> 04:27.532
I had to tell matty.
What would I say?

04:27.534 --> 04:27.966
Nothing.

04:27.968 --> 04:29.234
Which meant
I had to avoid him

04:29.236 --> 04:31.470
Until I got back
from my guilt trip.

04:31.472 --> 04:33.505
- Hey, we need to figure
some stuff out.

04:33.507 --> 04:34.973
- My guilt trip
had been extended.

04:34.975 --> 04:37.109
There's nothing
to figure out, it's over.

04:37.111 --> 04:38.710
- But it's on Friday.

04:38.712 --> 04:39.711
- What's on Friday?

04:39.713 --> 04:41.179
- Your birthday.
[laughs]

04:41.181 --> 04:42.814
What do you wanna do
to celebrate?

04:42.816 --> 04:45.684
- Right, yes.
My birthday.

04:45.686 --> 04:47.853
Uh, nothing.

04:47.855 --> 04:49.321
I don't wanna do anything.

04:49.323 --> 04:50.756
- Are you sure?

04:50.758 --> 04:51.990
Okay, but think about it.

04:51.992 --> 04:55.294
I'm not gonna let you
get out of it that easy.

04:55.296 --> 04:57.729
- And I'm not either.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.665
What are you thinking,
cheating on matty?

04:59.667 --> 05:01.266
You need to shut
that shit down.

05:01.268 --> 05:02.801
- Tamara has
such a loud mouth.

05:02.803 --> 05:05.604
- Oh-ho-ho, I didn't hear it
from tamara.

05:05.606 --> 05:07.506
I got it from my daily
mafia briefing.

05:07.508 --> 05:08.774
- The mafia knows?

05:08.776 --> 05:10.142
- Is that
a rhetorical question?

05:10.144 --> 05:11.877
Of course we do.
We're magic.

05:11.879 --> 05:14.413
But don't flip out yet.

05:14.415 --> 05:17.215
Asians not only know
how to do great hair,

05:17.217 --> 05:18.016
But they keep things quiet.

05:18.018 --> 05:22.888
- Well, great, 'cause I'm on
my way to end it right now.

05:22.890 --> 05:23.655
- Ming!

05:23.657 --> 05:27.125
- [chuckles]
you're back!

05:27.127 --> 05:30.796
- Am I?

05:30.798 --> 05:33.131
- Becca's m.I.A.
Or laying low.

05:33.133 --> 05:34.232
Either way, she's done.

05:34.234 --> 05:36.435
There's nothing to fear.

05:36.437 --> 05:37.502
How was idaho?

05:37.504 --> 05:38.437
- Not bad.

05:38.439 --> 05:40.539
Not good, just safe,

05:40.541 --> 05:42.341
Although I'm gonna miss
taking ceramics.

05:42.343 --> 05:44.242
I really worked out
a lot of my anxiety

05:44.244 --> 05:46.611
Throwing a good pot
or two.

05:46.613 --> 05:49.181
I even made you
a clay hat.

05:49.183 --> 05:51.450
I've missed you, ming.

05:51.452 --> 05:52.584
Just ming.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.920
- I missed you too.

05:54.922 --> 05:56.521
Why don't you sign up
for ceramics here?

05:56.523 --> 05:58.890
- I tried, but they're
over capacity.

05:58.892 --> 06:02.627
- Hmm.

06:02.629 --> 06:06.665
Not anymore.
You're in.

06:10.203 --> 06:10.736
- Huh.

06:10.738 --> 06:13.038
- This is crazy,
and it needs to stop.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.106
- What needs to stop?

06:14.108 --> 06:16.908
- Uh, we were just
discussing my birthday.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.543
Everyone's making way too big
a deal about it.

06:18.545 --> 06:20.479
- Interesting,
because matty told me

06:20.481 --> 06:22.981
That no one was making
a big deal about it.

06:22.983 --> 06:26.418
You know matty, right?
Jenna's boyfriend.

06:26.420 --> 06:30.322
- Sure do.

06:30.324 --> 06:33.091
- You need to watch it.
- Watch what?

06:33.093 --> 06:34.960
- Whatever it is
that's going on

06:34.962 --> 06:35.861
Between the two of you.

06:35.863 --> 06:39.631
Even though matty is blind
to your treachery,

06:39.633 --> 06:40.132
I'm not.

06:40.134 --> 06:41.700
I know
when something's up,

06:41.702 --> 06:45.203
And something
is definitely up.

06:45.205 --> 06:47.105
- Really?

06:47.107 --> 06:49.274
Do tell.

06:49.276 --> 06:52.844
- Um, we were
just discussing

06:52.846 --> 06:55.380
Working on...

06:55.382 --> 06:57.048
The assignment together.

06:57.050 --> 06:59.451
I was thinking
that we could write a story

06:59.453 --> 07:00.585
About the genesis
of a girl

07:00.587 --> 07:04.456
Who goes from heinous wallflower
to hideous skank.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.491
- So it's
an autobiographical piece?

07:06.493 --> 07:09.227
- Yes.

07:09.229 --> 07:11.696
No, I mean,
not about me.

07:11.698 --> 07:14.466
- Miss saxton, don't feign
modesty in my class.

07:14.468 --> 07:17.736
Anti-heroes are complicated
character studies.

07:17.738 --> 07:22.007
And heinous skanks
are pleasures to read and ruin.

07:22.009 --> 07:24.576
So why don't you write that up
and act it out?

07:24.578 --> 07:25.744
I suspect you know
how to play

07:25.746 --> 07:27.512
A heinous character
quite well.

07:27.514 --> 07:29.848
- I-I can't--

07:29.850 --> 07:32.117
I can't do that.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.452
- Well...

07:33.454 --> 07:35.487
Then don't fuck around
in my class.

07:35.489 --> 07:35.887
Capisce?

07:35.889 --> 07:37.722
If you wanna bully
miss hamilton here,

07:37.724 --> 07:38.623
Do it online.

07:38.625 --> 07:39.825
You grow some balls.

07:39.827 --> 07:42.494
No one gets anywhere in life
taking shit.

07:42.496 --> 07:43.695
Now give me 500 words

07:43.697 --> 07:48.934
On the nuances
of being a pussy.

07:48.936 --> 07:49.534
Now.

07:49.536 --> 07:51.470
- Post-my cowardly
reflection expression

07:51.472 --> 07:53.638
That was surprisingly
not hard to write,

07:53.640 --> 07:57.142
I realized I needed to shed
my scaredy-cat skin.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.243
I was not a wuss
or a puss.

07:58.245 --> 08:01.112
So it was time to shut down
the collin ballin'

08:01.114 --> 08:02.080
Once and for all.

08:02.082 --> 08:03.114
- Hey, man.
What's up?

08:03.116 --> 08:05.450
- Or once
my boyfriend skedoodled.

08:05.452 --> 08:07.052
- Sorry I missed your party
last weekend.

08:07.054 --> 08:08.920
Did I miss much?
- No, nothin'.

08:08.922 --> 08:11.256
Nothin' at all.
- So I need a favor.

08:11.258 --> 08:12.023
- Uh, okay.

08:12.025 --> 08:12.891
- That photographer chick

08:12.893 --> 08:14.159
That you had
the party for,

08:14.161 --> 08:14.960
What's her name?

08:14.962 --> 08:16.094
- Elizabeth karen.
- Right.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.996
I'd love to buy
one of her photographs

08:17.998 --> 08:19.030
For jenna's birthday.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.332
Think you could help me
get one

08:20.334 --> 08:21.766

17:24.577 --> 17:26.911
And if that means
that I just have to enjoy

17:26.913 --> 17:29.514
The nice things and not ask
where they come from,

17:29.516 --> 17:31.916
I will do that...

17:31.918 --> 17:34.819
For you.

17:34.821 --> 17:38.122
- For us.

17:43.262 --> 17:47.799
Now, put this on.

17:47.801 --> 17:48.299
- Hey, t.

17:48.301 --> 17:50.468
I don't know
where you've been all day,

17:50.470 --> 17:51.335
But the deed is done.

17:51.337 --> 17:54.372
It's over.
Happy birthday to me.

17:54.374 --> 17:56.140
I promise there won't be
any more secrets

17:56.142 --> 17:56.974
To keep any time soon.

17:56.976 --> 17:59.444
I just need to figure out
how to tell matty

17:59.446 --> 18:01.245
And then you can go on a diet.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.581
I was finally getting
my birthday wish.

18:03.583 --> 18:07.452
Time to decompress
and de-stress alone.

18:07.454 --> 18:10.888
- Jenna.

18:10.890 --> 18:12.290
- Or not.

18:16.028 --> 18:17.128
- What are you doing here?

18:17.130 --> 18:18.896
- I'm not causing trouble.

18:18.898 --> 18:19.597
Promise.

18:19.599 --> 18:22.533
I just felt like I was
a little harsh this morning.

18:22.535 --> 18:25.870
And then, when I found out
today was your birthday,

18:25.872 --> 18:28.973
I had to make amends.

18:28.975 --> 18:30.475
I got you this.

18:30.477 --> 18:31.943
- You didn't have
to do that.

18:31.945 --> 18:35.046
- I wanted to.

18:35.048 --> 18:36.013
Can we be friends?

18:36.015 --> 18:37.181
I promise
to control myself.

18:37.183 --> 18:42.253
And we can completely forget
anything ever happened.

18:42.255 --> 18:43.621
- Sure.

18:43.623 --> 18:44.989
Do you wanna come in?

18:44.991 --> 18:47.191
You know, as a friend?

18:47.193 --> 18:50.094
- I'd love that.

18:50.096 --> 18:52.930
- ♪ tell me
if it's not enough ♪

18:52.932 --> 18:57.201
♪ tell me
if it's not enough ♪

18:57.203 --> 19:01.772
All: Surprise!

19:06.044 --> 19:07.512
- Shit.

19:09.381 --> 19:10.248
- Next on <i>awkward...</i>

19:10.250 --> 19:11.782
I am an asshole
and a cheater and a liar.

19:11.784 --> 19:12.817
And everyone hates me.

19:12.819 --> 19:13.885
- Did you and matty
break up?

19:13.887 --> 19:14.819
- They're over.
- Finished.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.988
- Done-zel washington.
- They're not done.

19:16.990 --> 19:20.358
- What happened next?
- Where are you going?

19:20.360 --> 19:23.094
- To talk to matty.
- To...

19:23.096 --> 19:24.662
Break up?
Make up?

19:24.664 --> 19:26.097
- I don't know.
