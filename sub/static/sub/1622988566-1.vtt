you for your property,

33:49.013 --> 33:53.650
Um, I've been thinking
and I think that we should

33:53.683 --> 33:55.987

Ballsack.

34:06.063 --> 34:08.598
[Rufus sighs]

34:09.666 --> 34:11.101
What if I got another personal
loan

34:11.135 --> 34:13.436
and pay off payroll for the
month?

34:13.469 --> 34:15.705

over

standing

[Jane chuckles]

37:17.254 --> 37:18.089
Yeah.

37:19.223 --> 37:20.224
You know, it's funny because
it's like,

37:20.257 --> 37:22.592
when you're on the
outside, you look at people

37:22.625 --> 37:24.261

either like successful

37:24.295 --> 37:26.063
or not successful.

37:26.097 --> 37:29.699
And then uh, you get
closer and you realize

37:29.733 --> 37:31.268
that the people you
thought were killing it

37:31.302 --> 37:33.971
are um, sleeping in their vans.

37:34.005 --> 37:35.039
Well, half the people I know

43:14.978 --> 43:15.946
Yeah, he's depressed. Look at
his face.

43:15.979 --> 43:16.747
[Maddie] Yeah, everybody
knows he's depressed.

43:16.781 --> 43:18.549
- Depressed.
- No, I'm not depressed,

43:18.582 --> 43:20.451
but I will say I'm happy Jane is
here.

43:20.484 --> 43:21.385
[Jane gasps]

43:21.418 --> 43:23.087
Jane also happy Jane here.

43:28.992 --> 43:30.227
What?

43:30.260 --> 43:31.128
Fucking smoke it.

43:31.161 --> 43:32.529
[laughing]

43:32.563 --> 43:33.430
Smoke it.

43:33.464 --> 43:34.932
Yeah, come on.

43:34.965 --> 43:35.632
What is wrong with you?

43:35.666 --> 43:36.667
Let it still, smoke a cigarette-

43:36.700 --> 43:37.501
- I'm pregnant.
- With your friend.

43:37.534 --> 43:38.335
What?

43:39.603 --> 43:40.404
What?

43:42.606 --> 43:43.374
I'm pregnant.

43:45.943 --> 43:46.610
For real?

43:46.643 --> 43:48.011
- Yeah.
- Are you fu-

43:48.045 --> 43:48.912
You're not fucking with me, are
you?

43:48.946 --> 43:49.546
- For real?
- No.

43:51.515 --> 43:53.617
Get this shit away from my baby.

43:53.650 --> 43:54.451
Are you fucking kidding me?

43:54.485 --> 43:56.053
Holy shit.

43:56.086 --> 43:57.354
No!

43:57.388 --> 44:00.057
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- No, I'm pregnant.

44:01.258 --> 44:02.059
Oh my god.

44:04.428 --> 44:06.530
Oh my god, I'm so fucking happy
for you.

44:06.563 --> 44:08.298
Holy shit, you're fucking
pregnant!

44:08.332 --> 44:09.566
- [Maddie yells]
- Are you fucking kidding me?

44:09.600 --> 44:10.968
Shh, shh, shh.

44:12.236 --> 44:13.670
Shh.
Shh, shh, sorry.

44:13.704 --> 44:15.105
I'm drunk, I'm sorry.

44:15.139 --> 44:16.340
- I'm a little drunk.
- It's okay, it's okay.

44:16.373 --> 44:17.307
Okay, okay.

44:18.375 --> 44:19.209
I just cannot fucking...

44:19.243 --> 44:20.477
Oh shit. I'm sorry.

44:20.511 --> 44:21.645
I'm sorry.

44:21.678 --> 44:23.313
God get this shit away from you.

44:23.347 --> 44:24.381
Fuck.

44:24.415 --> 44:25.983
Whoa.

44:26.016 --> 44:28.018
Um, okay.

44:28.051 --> 44:32.256
How um, how many, like how,
how, how far along are you?

44:32.289 --> 44:33.357
How big is it?

44:33.390 --> 44:35.092
Is it, is it like a lemon?

44:35.125 --> 44:38.195
- Is it smaller than a lemon?
- Well, I am about two months.

44:38.228 --> 44:39.329
Two months?

44:39.363 --> 44:41.298
Yeah, so we aren't telling
anyone yet.

44:41.331 --> 44:42.499
Okay.

44:42.533 --> 44:43.400
Yeah, no, no.

44:43.434 --> 44:44.334
- I'm gonna keep it-
- Shh.

44:44.368 --> 44:45.469
I'll keep it zipped right up.

44:45.502 --> 44:46.570
I'll keep it up.

44:46.603 --> 44:47.671
Yeah.

44:47.704 --> 44:49.473
- Holy shit.
- [Maddie laughs]

44:49.506 --> 44:52.109
So like what are you
gonna do when um, the,

44:53.210 --> 44:54.144
it's so weird to say this.

44:54.178 --> 44:56.413
What are you gonna do when the
baby comes?

44:56.447 --> 44:58.148
Baby.

44:58.182 --> 45:00.384
I'll get bought out and stay
home.

45:00.417 --> 45:02.152
Wow.

45:02.186 --> 45:03.020
- To pursue writing full time.
- Right, right, right, right.

45:03.053 --> 45:03.987
Of course.

45:04.021 --> 45:07.157
I mean, but like, if
you want to stay home,

45:07.191 --> 45:08.992
dude you just fucking stay home.

45:09.026 --> 45:10.160
You know?

45:10.194 --> 45:11.228
Just stay home.

45:11.261 --> 45:13.096
- Thanks.
- Yeah, just do it.

45:14.665 --> 45:16.733
I don't want to leave
completely.

45:16.768 --> 45:18.202
Yeah.

45:18.235 --> 45:20.637
I always feel I'll be
fine with one foot in,

45:20.671 --> 45:22.706
and then I get tractor-beamed.

45:22.739 --> 45:23.707
Boom.

45:23.740 --> 45:25.676
That Rufus Paisley tractor beam.

45:25.709 --> 45:27.644
I'm very familiar with that.

45:27.678 --> 45:29.346
Yeah.

45:29.379 --> 45:31.448
Especially because things
were so rough for awhile, so.

45:32.649 --> 45:33.785
What do you mean?

45:33.818 --> 45:35.252
Jamie and I had to
like loan the business

45:35.285 --> 45:37.187
some money like sometime back.

45:38.722 --> 45:40.624
- Oh.
- Yeah.

45:40.657 --> 45:42.326
Wow. I didn't, I didn't know
that.

45:42.359 --> 45:43.727
[Maddie] Yeah.

45:43.761 --> 45:45.529
[Tyler] A little more
than a skosh, sorry.

45:58.742 --> 45:59.610
So how's it feel?

46:01.813 --> 46:03.046
What?

46:03.080 --> 46:04.114
Being a big deal, man.

46:05.449 --> 46:09.386
Playing for 20,000
screaming fans every night,

46:09.419 --> 46:11.655
taking the earth by the horns?

46:14.224 --> 46:15.492
No, it's cool, you know?

46:15.526 --> 46:16.393
It's cool?

46:17.427 --> 46:19.129
Yeah.

46:19.162 --> 46:20.531
I mean, it's kinda, you know,
it's the same thing right?

46:20.564 --> 46:22.699
Just higher stakes.

46:23.667 --> 46:24.769
More pressures and...

46:28.773 --> 46:30.641
I mean, I'm not complaining.
Don't get me wrong.

46:30.674 --> 46:31.742
We've been crazy lucky.

46:33.143 --> 46:36.146
- Yeah.
- But I don't know, man.

46:36.179 --> 46:39.550
Sometimes I think about those,
those old days when we were

46:39.583 --> 46:41.184
playing at Rollers all the time,

46:42.419 --> 46:46.089
- back when it was just for fun.
- [Rufus chuckles]

46:46.123 --> 46:47.691
I don't know, it's
usually when I'm sitting

46:47.724 --> 46:49.326
in another fucking meeting with

46:49.359 --> 46:52.830
some fucktard marketing exec and
I just,

46:54.264 --> 46:56.533
I wish I could live in
your world for awhile.

46:56.567 --> 46:59.336
[Rufus laughs]

46:59.369 --> 47:01.405
Take all that pressure
off, though, really.

47:01.438 --> 47:04.141
[Rufus chuckles]

47:06.710 --> 47:07.578
You know what I mean?

47:07.611 --> 47:09.212
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:09.246 --> 47:10.247
Yeah, I get it.

47:12.316 --> 47:13.617
- I'm just-
- Yeah, yeah, Tyler,

47:13.650 --> 47:14.751
I, I get it.

47:16.320 --> 47:17.120
I get it.

47:18.221 --> 47:19.456
Look, I'm just trying to say,
man,

47:21.358 --> 47:22.626
I miss being around, you know?

47:23.761 --> 47:24.561
Huh.

47:27.664 --> 47:29.166
That's cool.

47:29.199 --> 47:31.535
I mean, we both know what
happened.

47:34.939 --> 47:35.840
No, we don't.

47:35.873 --> 47:37.441
You got big and you bailed.

47:37.474 --> 47:38.776
[Tyler scoffs]

47:38.810 --> 47:39.610
Yeah.

47:40.912 --> 47:42.546
And now you want to
come back to your roots

47:42.579 --> 47:43.881
to the land of who the fuck
cares

47:43.915 --> 47:45.649
so you can remember what it's
like to live

47:45.682 --> 47:47.451
without all that horrible
pressure

47:47.484 --> 47:48.920
from people throwing money at
you

47:48.953 --> 47:50.687
and going broke from screaming
your name.

47:50.721 --> 47:52.422
Oh my god, I get it.

47:52.456 --> 47:53.523
- I get it.
- If that's the story you

47:53.557 --> 47:55.325
wanna tell yourself man, go for
it.

47:55.359 --> 47:57.561
No, it's not a story.
It's what happened, Tyler.

47:59.363 --> 48:01.331
You ghosted me, dude.

48:01.365 --> 48:02.767
I quit calling because
you quit answering, man.

48:02.800 --> 48:04.301
Yeah, 'cause you sold out.

48:06.236 --> 48:08.639
Dude, you're the one
bailing on legit acts

48:08.672 --> 48:10.507
so you can book a fucking kids
band, man.

48:12.275 --> 48:14.378
Yeah, yeah. People talk, man.

48:14.411 --> 48:15.345
You should know that.

48:17.849 --> 48:19.282
And just because we're popular

48:19.316 --> 48:20.651
doesn't mean we sold out, man.

48:21.786 --> 48:23.487
We play the music we love.

48:23.520 --> 48:25.288
Yeah, bro, because I
hustled for you, man.

48:25.322 --> 48:27.224
And that's why I'm here, Rufus.

48:27.257 --> 48:28.325
I'm fuckin' here, man.

48:29.827 --> 48:30.928
I should've known that all I'd
hear

48:30.962 --> 48:33.865
is the same old garbage
from another jaded musician

48:33.898 --> 48:35.432
who couldn't hack it on the
road.

48:39.469 --> 48:42.272
Hey, by the way? Man,
we could have been huge.

48:43.540 --> 48:44.441
But you quit.

48:46.443 --> 48:48.780
That deal was almost closed,

48:48.813 --> 48:52.349
but you chose to come back to
Rollers, and I started Dogs.

48:54.418 --> 48:55.218
That's life, man.

48:56.788 --> 48:59.356
[slams]
Fuck!

49:00.524 --> 49:02.459
Everything okay, Rufus?

49:04.762 --> 49:05.595
Is he okay?

49:07.899 --> 49:10.734
[guitar strumming]

49:11.869 --> 49:13.270
You didn't even ask?

49:13.303 --> 49:14.738
It didn't come up.

49:14.772 --> 49:15.605
That's the whole point of going

49:15.639 --> 49:16.606
to talk to him, man, was to ask
him.

49:16.640 --> 49:19.376
Yeah but just, let's,
let's have a party.

49:19.409 --> 49:20.477
- A party?
- Yeah.

49:20.510 --> 49:22.379
We are on our backs right now

49:22.412 --> 49:24.281
with three lawyers standing over
us.

49:24.314 --> 49:25.149
And you know what they have?

49:25.183 --> 49:26.249
You know what they have in their
hands?

49:26.283 --> 49:27.919
Socks full of nickels, man.

49:27.952 --> 49:29.319
Yeah, but let's just have a
party.

49:29.352 --> 49:31.789
Yo man, I just, I need a drink,
bro.

49:31.823 --> 49:32.824
You're already drunk.

49:32.857 --> 49:33.690
Know what? Here.

49:34.926 --> 49:35.760
Chill pills.

49:35.793 --> 49:36.560
Take a few.

49:38.930 --> 49:40.263
[Donnie grunts]

49:40.297 --> 49:42.033
You have an opportunity to save
Rollers

49:42.066 --> 49:44.701
and all you gotta do is talk to
Tyler

49:44.735 --> 49:46.403
and tell him what's really going
on.

49:47.504 --> 49:48.705
This is about Jane, isn't it?

49:48.739 --> 49:50.407
No, no. This is not about Jane.

49:50.440 --> 49:52.375
This is about Rollers, man,
okay?

49:52.409 --> 49:54.277
And the people who play here and
see shows

49:54.311 --> 49:56.914
and you and Mills and Quinn and
Taylor.

49:56.948 --> 49:59.784
Oh, she quit today, but,
you know what I mean.

49:59.817 --> 50:01.018
You get like this.

50:01.052 --> 50:02.552
You act like a crackhead
every time she's around.

50:02.586 --> 50:03.720
Her dad died, Donnie.

50:03.755 --> 50:04.554
- So?
- Seriously.

50:04.588 --> 50:05.990
[door opens]

50:06.023 --> 50:06.891
- Hey.
- All right.

50:06.924 --> 50:09.060
You just barged right in.

50:09.093 --> 50:10.762
Thank you.

50:10.795 --> 50:12.029
Oh. Oh, y'all want me to come
back?

50:12.063 --> 50:13.865
Oh no, no, no. We're
about to have a party.

50:13.898 --> 50:16.566
- Oh, a party?
- Yes, a party.

50:16.600 --> 50:17.869
Yes.

50:17.902 --> 50:18.668
Wait, did you get that
electrician scheduled?

50:18.702 --> 50:19.503
- Because how are we gonna-
- No, no.

50:19.536 --> 50:20.437
Forget the electrician. Forget
it.

50:20.470 --> 50:22.572
It's just, just for the box by
the stage.

50:22.606 --> 50:23.607
I mean you said that last week
and it's-

50:23.640 --> 50:24.574
Yes, forget last week.

50:24.608 --> 50:26.443
I'm talking about right now and
right now,

50:26.476 --> 50:27.779
I think you should have a beer,
okay?

50:27.812 --> 50:28.780
I know you should have a beer.

50:28.813 --> 50:30.014
That's technically illegal,

50:30.047 --> 50:31.648
but I'm the master of this
domain,

50:31.681 --> 50:32.682
and if I say you should have a
beer,

50:32.716 --> 50:33.785
you, sir, should have a beer.

50:33.818 --> 50:34.651
Okay?

50:34.684 --> 50:35.485
So...

50:37.789 --> 50:38.790
Brewski mode activated.

50:40.992 --> 50:42.860
Let's drink beer.

50:42.894 --> 50:44.061
Beer will make us happy.

50:44.095 --> 50:45.695
Why am I not in that picture?

50:45.729 --> 50:46.663
When did, when did that happen?

50:46.696 --> 50:47.664
This picture was before you bro.

50:47.697 --> 50:49.733
[Donnie] If we drink,
the pain will go away.

50:49.767 --> 50:50.700
It always does.

50:53.570 --> 50:56.673
You have an opportunity to
save Rollers right now, man,

50:56.706 --> 50:59.043
and all you have to do is talk
to Tyler

50:59.076 --> 51:01.511
and tell him what's really going
on.

51:01.545 --> 51:02.746
This is about Jane, isn't it?

51:04.816 --> 51:06.017
[Stan] Rufus, it's Stan again.

51:06.050 --> 51:08.485
Look, I believe in you, kid.

51:08.518 --> 51:10.520
But I put my ass out there
for this refi, all right?

51:10.554 --> 51:11.856
Now I need your help.

51:12.924 --> 51:15.993
So give me that check first
thing on Monday morning

51:16.027 --> 51:17.962
or a check won't do it anymore,

51:17.995 --> 51:19.931
and you're gonna have to
dislodge Potter's

51:19.964 --> 51:22.767
fat fist from my ass.

51:22.800 --> 51:24.836
Call me. Just call me.

Yeah, me too.

Seriously, dude, what the H
happened?

You gotta figure out what you
want

01:32:28.565 --> 01:32:29.800
to do with Rollers, man.

01:32:31.268 --> 01:32:33.570

I just know people need Rollers.

01:32:40.010 --> 01:32:40.811

01:32:42.179 --> 01:32:43.914
The whole community is
not gonna fall apart

01:32:43.947 --> 01:32:44.948
because you gotta quit.

01:32:46.517 --> 01:32:48.252
You're not fuckin' George
Bailey.

01:32:49.987 --> 01:32:51.322
But you are Rufus Paisley.

01:32:53.524 --> 01:32:54.358
And I need you.

01:33:09.506 --> 01:33:12.443
I'm really glad that you came
back.

01:33:15.112 --> 01:33:15.913
Me, too.

01:33:20.951 --> 01:33:22.920
[Cramer J] It's a sad day
here in the Grotto folks.

01:33:22.953 --> 01:33:24.555
It feels like we're losing
a member of a family.

01:33:24.588 --> 01:33:25.956
[Captain Dingus] After 101
years,

01:33:25.989 --> 01:33:28.025
tonight marks the last show
before Rollers

01:33:28.058 --> 01:33:29.993
closes its doors forever.

01:33:30.027 --> 01:33:31.462
[Cramer J] Now we
called up longtime owner

01:33:31.495 --> 01:33:34.631
and operator Rufus Paisley
to give us some thoughts,

01:33:34.665 --> 01:33:36.467
and he asked us to play an
interview

01:33:36.500 --> 01:33:38.535
we did with his dad years ago

01:33:38.569 --> 01:33:41.105
when Rollers was hitting
a bit of a rough patch.

01:33:41.138 --> 01:33:42.239
[Captain Dingus] Roll the tape,
Jerry.

01:33:42.272 --> 01:33:44.274
[Cramer J] Rollers is a
huge part of this community.

01:33:44.308 --> 01:33:46.243
Now is this the end? Is
this the end of the line?

01:33:46.276 --> 01:33:48.112
[Ragged Man] Well, my
grandmother,

01:33:48.145 --> 01:33:52.649
her favorite thing to say was
there's a time for everything.

01:33:53.317 --> 01:33:56.320
A time to eat, and a time to be
hungry,

01:33:56.353 --> 01:33:58.589
she used to say when I'd come
crashing into her kitchen.

01:33:58.622 --> 01:34:00.524
[Captain Dingus] Well a lovely
story.

01:34:00.557 --> 01:34:02.493
I think what we're all
dying to know, though,

01:34:02.526 --> 01:34:05.195
is how hot was your grandma?

01:34:05.229 --> 01:34:06.296
[Ragged Man laughs]

01:34:06.330 --> 01:34:08.031
The people wanna know, Mr.
Paisley.

01:34:08.065 --> 01:34:09.566
[laughing]

01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:11.201
[Cramer J] All kidding aside,
settle down, Dingus, okay?

01:34:11.235 --> 01:34:13.370
Mr. Paisley, we're dying to
know,

01:34:13.404 --> 01:34:14.238
is this the end of the line?

01:34:14.271 --> 01:34:16.340
[Ragged Man] No,
that's not why I'm here.

01:34:16.373 --> 01:34:19.343
But when that day does come and
it will,

01:34:19.376 --> 01:34:21.011
it won't be the end.

01:34:21.044 --> 01:34:24.615
See, Rollers isn't just a place,

01:34:24.648 --> 01:34:28.018
a couple of plaster walls and a
stage.

01:34:28.051 --> 01:34:31.221
Rollers is a family, a group of
all sorts

01:34:31.255 --> 01:34:33.424
of crazy ass people who came
together

01:34:33.457 --> 01:34:38.228
to make all sorts of things
like love, trouble, music.

01:34:39.997 --> 01:34:43.066
And I know that as long
as people keep doing that,

01:34:43.100 --> 01:34:47.171
keep reaching outside themselves,
keep that, that spirit,

01:34:48.305 --> 01:34:50.307
Rollers will always live on.
