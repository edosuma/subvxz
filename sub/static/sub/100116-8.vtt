WEBVTT

00:00.160 --> 00:01.460
Previously on Legacies...
I found a way to bring back

00:01.460 --> 00:04.270
everyone's Malivore memories.

00:04.270 --> 00:06.770
Landon, I love you.

00:06.770 --> 00:08.740
LANDON:
Monsters aren't
the only problem.

00:08.740 --> 00:11.010
So I have to leave,
knowing that they'll follow me

00:11.010 --> 00:13.940
When the moon reaches its apex
tomorrow night...
Simu-me will disintegrate.

00:13.940 --> 00:17.880
It's the only way anyone can
think of to close the portal.
CLARKE: My consciousness

00:17.880 --> 00:19.980
will transfer to
the next person I cut.

00:19.980 --> 00:20.980
(grunts)

00:35.930 --> 00:37.700
(door opens)

00:40.900 --> 00:45.510
Ah, yes, I did a spell
to alter your appearance.

00:45.510 --> 00:46.640
Turn you into
the most vile thing

00:46.640 --> 00:47.840
I could imagine.

00:50.310 --> 00:51.650
I just look like me.

00:51.650 --> 00:53.920
Then I nailed it.
Huh. I thought
you'd rather

00:53.920 --> 00:56.520
stare at Landon's
sad little face.

00:57.390 --> 00:58.590
Sorry.

00:58.590 --> 01:01.620
To be honest,
I'm glad you're here.

01:01.620 --> 01:04.490
You clearly hate me,
so I can't imagine why.

01:04.490 --> 01:07.530
Because there's still time
for you to come to your senses

01:07.530 --> 01:09.630
before you toss me into the pit.

01:09.630 --> 01:11.770
One, it's more of a ditch;

01:11.770 --> 01:14.700
two, I'm really
looking forward to it;

01:14.700 --> 01:17.540
and three, you're trapped inside
a magically created body

01:17.540 --> 01:19.410
that expires
at midnight.

01:19.410 --> 01:21.580
Save your breath.

01:21.580 --> 01:23.750
There's no one coming
to save you.

01:25.720 --> 01:28.820
You're going into a grave
you dug for yourself.

01:47.370 --> 01:49.640
Oh, my God,
it's snowing.

01:53.380 --> 01:54.940
Oh, boy.

01:59.380 --> 02:02.490
(indistinct chatter, shouting)

02:02.490 --> 02:03.750
(chuckles)
Hey!

02:03.750 --> 02:07.590
No fair.
Wasn't even looking.

02:08.560 --> 02:09.860
(laughs)

02:13.030 --> 02:14.800
Okay.

02:34.150 --> 02:35.620
Kaleb.

02:35.620 --> 02:36.990
What the hell is going on?

02:36.990 --> 02:39.520
Don't be a Scrooge, Hope.
It's Christmas.

02:39.520 --> 02:41.420
No. It's October.

02:41.420 --> 02:43.530
Christmas is a state of mind.

02:43.530 --> 02:45.660
It's a feeling in the air.

02:45.660 --> 02:49.630
Now...
you feeling it?

02:50.730 --> 02:53.170
Definitely feeling something.

03:00.610 --> 03:04.480

03:04.480 --> 03:06.550

03:06.550 --> 03:10.490

I got here as fast as I could.

03:10.490 --> 03:12.790
On the drive over,

03:12.790 --> 03:14.220
I saw snowmen
going up all over town.

03:14.220 --> 03:15.790
Kids on sleds

03:15.790 --> 03:17.760
and adults running around
like idiots, stringing up

03:17.760 --> 03:19.160
Christmas lights,
drinking cocoa.

03:21.900 --> 03:23.530
Did someone say "cocoa"?

03:23.530 --> 03:25.970
This is bad, Dorian.

03:25.970 --> 03:27.840
This has to be the work
of another monster.

03:27.840 --> 03:29.670
And the last one
gave us a prophecy

03:29.670 --> 03:30.810
that we need to figure out,

03:30.810 --> 03:32.710
so you need to
turn that music off,

03:32.710 --> 03:34.080
and get your head in the game.

03:34.080 --> 03:38.180
And you need to get your ass
off the naughty list, Ric.

03:38.180 --> 03:39.480
Okay?

03:39.480 --> 03:40.850
So, like I said,

03:40.850 --> 03:43.890
cocoa, and then
we can talk about

03:43.890 --> 03:45.820
whatever it is you
want to talk about.

03:47.690 --> 03:50.090
Now, what were you
so worried about?

04:19.260 --> 04:22.160

I need your help.

04:22.160 --> 04:24.260
(both laughing)

04:24.260 --> 04:26.600
What are you wearing?

04:26.600 --> 04:27.630
Dorian had an extra one.

04:27.630 --> 04:29.730
Lucky me, right?
(laughs)

04:29.730 --> 04:31.130
No, Ric. We're
the lucky ones.

04:31.130 --> 04:35.240
Because Dr. Saltzman is gonna
spend Christmas with us.

04:35.240 --> 04:36.270
(cheering and applause)

04:36.270 --> 04:37.610
Thank you. Thank you.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.740
Thank you.

04:39.740 --> 04:41.010
Lizzie!

04:41.010 --> 04:44.210
We get it, Hope.
You're back.

04:44.210 --> 04:45.880
Now disappear again.

04:45.880 --> 04:47.850
Ah. You're still a bitch.
Thank God.

04:47.850 --> 04:50.020
What?

04:51.120 --> 04:52.760
What is happening?
I don't know.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.690
It's like everyone in the school
is happy except for us.

04:55.690 --> 04:56.960
Too happy.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.630
Like scary happy.

04:58.630 --> 05:01.000
Merry, even. They all think
that it's Christmas.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.070
And the snow
probably doesn't help.

05:04.230 --> 05:07.140
It's snowing? How?

05:07.140 --> 05:08.500
Uh, another monster,
I'm guessing.

05:09.710 --> 05:12.170
This is terrible news.

05:12.170 --> 05:15.610
It's freaking fall.
Not winter.

05:15.610 --> 05:17.650
What am I gonna wear?

05:17.650 --> 05:20.980
Something to travel in?

05:22.080 --> 05:24.050
I'm gonna need you
to hit the road.

05:25.190 --> 05:27.790
You want me to quest
for Frodo Baggins,

05:27.790 --> 05:29.290
don't you?

05:29.290 --> 05:31.030
I thought that the monsters
weren't after him now.

05:31.030 --> 05:32.360
We don't know
what they want,

05:32.360 --> 05:35.160
or even who
they're working for anymore.

05:35.160 --> 05:37.530
I just need Landon to be safe.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.240
(exhales)
Fine.

05:42.240 --> 05:45.780
A little locator spell
and then off to Mordor I go.

05:45.780 --> 05:48.380
Ho, ho, ho!

05:48.380 --> 05:49.980
I come bearing gifts.

05:51.010 --> 05:53.750
More like a peace offering,
really.

05:53.750 --> 05:56.920
I thought that
the three of us

05:56.920 --> 05:58.720
had already made peace.

05:58.720 --> 06:02.120
Well, this whole school year,
I have been really naughty.

06:02.120 --> 06:05.090
I've not been the supportive
sister that I want to be.

06:05.090 --> 06:06.830
And then there's Landon.
(scoffs)

06:06.830 --> 06:08.400
It was wrong of me to be jealous

06:08.400 --> 06:10.970
when his subconscious
just chose you.

06:10.970 --> 06:12.670
But thankfully,
Christmas

06:12.670 --> 06:13.900
is all about forgiveness, right?

06:13.900 --> 06:15.840
Cookie?

06:18.070 --> 06:19.180
Run.

06:21.910 --> 06:24.050
(clears throat)
What kind of cookie?

06:27.220 --> 06:28.680
(exhales)

06:28.680 --> 06:30.720
Dude, you didn't have
to get me anything.

06:30.720 --> 06:32.020
I mean, we don't even know

06:32.020 --> 06:33.660
when my birthday is,
just that it's this month.

06:33.660 --> 06:36.660
Okay, then today's as good a day
as any. Open it up.

06:39.960 --> 06:41.730
Um, it's...

06:41.730 --> 06:43.130
I have no idea.

06:43.130 --> 06:45.270
So while you were trapped
in wolf form,

06:45.270 --> 06:48.140
I had Josie do a lineage spell
to see if you had any ancestors

06:48.140 --> 06:49.770
who might know
how to turn you back.

06:49.770 --> 06:51.740
I figured
it was a long shot,

06:51.740 --> 06:53.010
but she got a hit.

06:54.740 --> 06:56.310
Your parents.

06:57.750 --> 06:58.880
My parents are dead, Lan.

06:58.880 --> 07:00.280
That's what
we thought.

07:00.280 --> 07:01.950
But the people who raised you
till you were ten

07:01.950 --> 07:03.350
weren't your real parents.

07:04.390 --> 07:05.890
How do you know that?

07:05.890 --> 07:07.320
Because locator
spells don't work

07:07.320 --> 07:09.260
on dead bodies.

07:09.260 --> 07:12.290
This is leading us
straight to...

07:13.930 --> 07:15.900
North Carolina.

07:17.300 --> 07:19.100
The same place that this bus
is going?

07:19.100 --> 07:20.800
I've seen how much
you've been struggling.

07:20.800 --> 07:23.770
I thought maybe meeting your
parents might help you heal.

07:23.770 --> 07:25.770
It's your call, Rafael.

07:48.930 --> 07:50.400
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:50.400 --> 07:52.940
Sounds like someone
could use a little help

07:52.940 --> 07:54.940
getting in the spirit.
You want to help?

07:54.940 --> 07:56.310
Find me an ax.

07:56.310 --> 07:58.770
So that's a neg on the nog?

07:58.770 --> 08:00.280
I need to figure out
what monster's making everyone

08:00.280 --> 08:02.380
so freaking merry,
then kill it.

08:02.380 --> 08:04.850
Whoa. That's naughty
as hell, Hope.

08:04.850 --> 08:07.820
I got to do all I can to
make it on Santa's nice list.

08:07.820 --> 08:10.050
'Cause I've been asking
for this one thing

08:10.050 --> 08:12.390
every Christmas and,
uh, I never got it.

08:12.390 --> 08:14.490
But I'm hoping that
this is the year.

08:14.490 --> 08:15.790
(slurping)

08:15.790 --> 08:17.390
Oh.

08:17.390 --> 08:19.400
Hell yeah. You sure you
don't want to hit this?

08:19.400 --> 08:22.100
If I started hitting stuff now,
I might never stop.

08:23.370 --> 08:26.270
There's got to be someone around
here as miserable as I am.

08:27.840 --> 08:30.770
CLARKE:
You're right.
I am miserable.

08:33.810 --> 08:36.510
So why would I help you?

08:36.510 --> 08:39.380
Believe me, I wish that
there was another option,

08:39.380 --> 08:41.820
but you're the only one
around here that's not

08:41.820 --> 08:44.490
eating figgy pudding.

08:45.990 --> 08:48.160
On the bright side,
me being miserable

08:48.160 --> 08:50.930
must be why I'm immune
to the Christmas spirit.

08:50.930 --> 08:52.190
What's your excuse?

08:52.190 --> 08:55.000
I used to love the holidays.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.470
But...

08:56.470 --> 08:59.370
I lost a lot of my family,
and everything changed.

08:59.370 --> 09:02.140
Everyone running around
here all thankful

09:02.140 --> 09:04.340
for what they have...

09:04.340 --> 09:06.280
You realize what you're missing.

09:09.010 --> 09:11.310
What?

09:12.920 --> 09:15.580
If anyone can relate
to being alone,

09:15.580 --> 09:17.150
it's me.

09:17.150 --> 09:19.290
I've never even had a Christmas.

09:22.860 --> 09:24.290
That's it.

09:24.290 --> 09:27.030
You want my help
figuring out your monster?

09:27.030 --> 09:31.000
Let me eat, drink and be merry

09:31.000 --> 09:32.470
for once in my life.

09:32.470 --> 09:34.270
Go out with a bang.

09:34.270 --> 09:36.510
Now...
(clears throat)

09:36.510 --> 09:39.340
...should old acquaintance
be forgot?

09:50.050 --> 09:52.550
Come on, we're almost there.

09:52.550 --> 09:54.390
Uh, do you remember
the last time

09:54.390 --> 09:56.190
that you tried to reunite

09:56.190 --> 09:59.160
a father and a son?
I just need you to consider

09:59.160 --> 10:01.030
that when Josie returned
all of our memories,

10:01.030 --> 10:03.430
I remembered everyone
that went into the Malivore pit,

10:03.430 --> 10:05.070
and it wasn't
just Hope.

10:05.070 --> 10:07.200
Your mom.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.000
Was meeting her everything
I hoped it would be?

10:09.000 --> 10:10.340
No.

10:10.340 --> 10:11.610
But I'm really
glad I did.

10:11.610 --> 10:13.210
I just wanted to give you
the same chance.

10:13.210 --> 10:14.640
And I hear that.

10:14.640 --> 10:17.950
Bro, you are the only family
that I need.

10:17.950 --> 10:19.520
So let's-let's
just keep moving

10:19.520 --> 10:21.280
before another monster
catches up with us.

10:21.280 --> 10:25.390
Raf, please...
Let go of me!

10:34.430 --> 10:36.300
I-I can't...

10:36.300 --> 10:38.270
I can't deal with this
right now.

10:38.270 --> 10:39.970
I just...
Hey. It's okay.

10:39.970 --> 10:41.670
Let's just get out of here.
Let's just get out of here.

10:41.670 --> 10:43.410
(gun clicks)

10:43.410 --> 10:46.210
I think you boys
better come with me.

10:51.180 --> 10:52.920
All right, pass
those ribbons around.

10:52.920 --> 10:55.180
Everybody write down
your Christmas wish on them.

10:55.180 --> 10:57.020
Don't let anyone see it.

10:57.020 --> 10:59.150
Then when you're done,
I want you to toss your ribbon

10:59.150 --> 11:01.160
into the fire.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.160
There you go.
(whoops)

11:02.160 --> 11:04.230
My bad, Pedro.

11:04.230 --> 11:06.700
Me and Santa got

Mm. My best guess?

11:48.170 --> 11:49.440
The Krampus.

11:49.440 --> 11:51.140
What the hell is a Krampus?

11:51.140 --> 11:52.270
Well, it's the
monster that brought

11:52.270 --> 11:54.380
all this snow and ice to town.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.710
And think of it
as the anti-Santa.

11:56.710 --> 11:59.380
Santa Claus rewards good
boys and girls, right?

11:59.380 --> 12:02.050
Well, the Krampus
does the opposite.

12:02.050 --> 12:04.750
It seeks out hatred and anger

12:04.750 --> 12:06.360
instead of peace and joy.

13:10.120 --> 13:11.720
Not if we're ready for it.

13:11.720 --> 13:14.190
By "we," do you mean the school

drunk on Christmas cheer?

13:17.020 --> 13:18.990
Or the grown men
running around

their spirits and getting them

13:35.610 --> 13:37.010
literally stop

13:37.010 --> 13:38.510
pushing my buttons?

13:38.510 --> 13:40.980
So, she finally speaks, eh?

13:40.980 --> 13:42.450
Sorry. But...

13:42.450 --> 13:45.150
modern machinery
fascinates me.

13:45.150 --> 13:46.990
This gas-guzzler
is older than dirt.

13:46.990 --> 13:50.190
My dad's friend gave it to me
and Josie for our sweet 16.

13:50.190 --> 13:52.190
We should stop for fuel, then.

13:52.190 --> 13:54.730
I could also use a proper meal.

13:54.730 --> 13:56.130

13:56.130 --> 13:57.730
Uh, whoever else stops for fuel.

13:57.730 --> 14:01.500
Yes.
Mm. You should've
eaten before we left.

14:03.200 --> 14:05.140
You know,
you confound me, Elizabeth.

14:05.140 --> 14:07.310
You know, when you made me
this daylight ring,

14:07.310 --> 14:09.580
I assumed it was a ruse.

14:09.580 --> 14:12.750
That you merely wanted
to spend time together beyond

14:12.750 --> 14:15.380
the loathsome confines
of your school.

14:15.380 --> 14:17.390
Well, then, you assumed wrong.

14:17.390 --> 14:20.320
The only reason that you're here
is because you keep me

14:20.320 --> 14:23.460
perpetually un-jolly.

14:26.190 --> 14:29.560
Well, we both know
that's not true.

14:31.630 --> 14:34.700
I'm here because
you fancy me, obviously.

14:40.240 --> 14:43.780
You command this vessel
like a drunken pirate.

14:43.780 --> 14:46.650

14:46.650 --> 14:48.420

14:48.420 --> 14:51.390
why don't you go eat Bambi?

14:53.790 --> 14:57.230

15:35.600 --> 15:38.170

HOPE:
All right! Didn't want to
deploy the nuclear option,

16:10.430 --> 16:12.300
but Santa's not real.

16:12.300 --> 16:14.770
He's a myth. And you're all
acting like a bunch of children.

16:14.770 --> 16:16.600
So let's just

16:16.600 --> 16:18.510
put the partridge
back in the pear tree

16:18.510 --> 16:20.340
and grow the hell up.

16:26.610 --> 16:28.580
She's right.

16:28.580 --> 16:30.320
I... This was all
too good to be true.

16:30.320 --> 16:32.790
I...

16:32.790 --> 16:35.860
I, uh, I don't know
what came over us.

16:37.490 --> 16:39.490
All right, you all heard her.

16:39.490 --> 16:41.460
Dorian, hit the books,

16:41.460 --> 16:42.500
figure out how the
Krampus operates.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.230
Josie, Kaleb,

16:44.230 --> 16:45.630
we need to set a trap
for this thing. Everyone else,

16:45.630 --> 16:48.200
get the kids to bed
and gather weapons.

16:48.200 --> 16:51.610
And someone bring me a crossbow.

16:51.610 --> 16:54.480
This is all
a-a misunderstanding.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.640
We were just lost.

17:09.720 --> 17:12.790
RAFAEL:
A werewolf cage?

17:12.790 --> 17:14.530
I saw your eyes.

17:14.530 --> 17:16.260
I know what you are.

17:16.260 --> 17:17.830
What you're going through.

17:17.830 --> 17:20.200
You're a werewolf.

17:20.200 --> 17:22.470
No.

17:22.470 --> 17:24.540
But I was in love with one.

17:27.480 --> 17:30.240
I met Lucia in Afghanistan.

17:30.240 --> 17:33.810
But if she'd known what would
happen after she took a life,

17:33.810 --> 17:36.150
she never would've
enlisted.

17:39.250 --> 17:41.560
When we got back to the States,

17:41.560 --> 17:43.820
she was like
a lot of us:

17:43.820 --> 17:47.260
fits of anger, memory loss,

17:47.260 --> 17:48.700
trouble with crowds.

17:48.700 --> 17:50.530
A classic
case of PTSD.

17:50.530 --> 17:53.930
Until that first full moon hit.

17:53.930 --> 17:55.700
Uh, why do you...
why do you keep talking

17:55.700 --> 17:57.000
about her in the past tense?

17:57.000 --> 17:59.240
What happened?

18:02.680 --> 18:05.710
Lucia was the bravest soldier
I ever knew.

18:05.710 --> 18:07.980
The only time I
ever saw her scared

18:07.980 --> 18:10.990
was when she found out
she was pregnant.

18:10.990 --> 18:13.790
You two had a-a kid?

18:17.960 --> 18:20.460
First full moon after she
learned she was expecting,

18:20.460 --> 18:21.830
she was just gone.

18:21.830 --> 18:25.000
I searched for her
for years, but...

18:25.000 --> 18:28.600
a soldier like her who doesn't
want to be found never will be.

18:31.470 --> 18:33.540
But I thought about her
and our baby

18:33.540 --> 18:35.280
every day since.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.880
So it's time you told
me why you're here.

18:40.780 --> 18:44.890
Because you have more than just
your mother's eyes, Rafael.

19:11.610 --> 19:14.580
Merry Christmas, Krampus.

19:16.480 --> 19:18.920
I believe you have
something for me.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.840
No, that-that's not
what I asked for.

19:38.840 --> 19:41.680
I wanted another trident.

19:45.110 --> 19:47.480
(grunts)

19:47.480 --> 19:50.920
What the hell are you doing?
You were supposed to save me.

20:01.060 --> 20:02.660
(grunting)

20:14.410 --> 20:16.110
(grunting)

20:21.210 --> 20:22.880
(shrieks)

20:22.880 --> 20:24.980
(coughs)

20:30.260 --> 20:32.060
I'm guessing
you're the Krampus.

20:32.060 --> 20:33.890
(screeching)

20:33.890 --> 20:35.160
Mittent.

20:41.170 --> 20:42.300
I'm Hope.

20:44.400 --> 20:47.370
And I find the holidays
really stressful.

20:55.210 --> 20:57.150
(cackles)

20:59.850 --> 21:02.490
Damn it.
That thing could be anywhere.

21:02.490 --> 21:04.790
Wait. I thought

21:04.790 --> 21:07.390
my father was bringing
the Krampus to save me.

21:07.390 --> 21:09.200
But I was wrong.

21:09.200 --> 21:11.360
He must have known
I was planning

21:11.360 --> 21:14.300
to jump into a new body
and screw him over again.

21:14.300 --> 21:15.470
How?

21:15.470 --> 21:17.200
Well, I don't know.

21:19.140 --> 21:20.370
But if you let me go,

21:20.370 --> 21:21.910
I can make it
to the portal

21:21.910 --> 21:23.110
before the Krampus kills me.

21:23.110 --> 21:24.810
Nice try, but
"fool me once" and all...

21:24.810 --> 21:26.080
What if there was a way
that I could prove to you

21:26.080 --> 21:28.180
that I'm on your side?

21:29.150 --> 21:32.690
That I'm telling the truth.

21:34.290 --> 21:36.260
RAFAEL:
I thought I had laid
the anger under control,

21:36.260 --> 21:39.090
but... but it just came back

21:39.090 --> 21:41.930
worse than ever,
you know?

21:41.930 --> 21:43.460
Being at school-- it helped,
because there was-there was

21:43.460 --> 21:47.070
other people like me.
But it turned out that

21:47.070 --> 21:50.240
it-it wasn't the right
place for us, you know.

21:50.240 --> 21:53.440
Sometimes you have to leave
to protect the people you love.

21:55.310 --> 21:57.110
I think that's why
my mom gave me up.

21:58.780 --> 22:01.250
Believe me,
I get it.

22:03.950 --> 22:05.920
I know running away
can feel like

22:05.920 --> 22:07.390
it's the only option.

22:11.460 --> 22:14.530
Sure I can't get you
something to drink, Landon?

22:14.530 --> 22:16.400
I'm good, Walt.

22:16.400 --> 22:19.200
Thank you.
For everything.

22:19.200 --> 22:22.970
Um, I'm just gonna
grab some air,

22:22.970 --> 22:24.070
if that's cool with you.

22:24.070 --> 22:26.070
Uh, yeah.

22:26.070 --> 22:28.010
Hey, Lan.

22:29.580 --> 22:32.110
I think maybe you were
right about coming here.

22:36.850 --> 22:38.420
(door closes)

22:47.830 --> 22:49.300
Hop in, hobbit.

22:49.300 --> 22:50.300
Lizzie?

22:50.300 --> 22:53.300
One more word and I will
feed you to the flames

22:53.300 --> 22:56.070
of Mount Doom myself.

23:09.950 --> 23:11.450

some cocoa?

23:46.890 --> 23:48.520

Wait, you two are still merry.

23:51.520 --> 23:54.560

is coming out.

Ho, ho, ho, ho!

24:19.390 --> 24:22.120
Who wouldn't be merry

24:22.120 --> 24:24.460

24:24.460 --> 24:27.230
SANTA CLAUS:
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

24:27.230 --> 24:30.600
It's the magic of Christmas,
Miss Mikaelson.

24:30.600 --> 24:34.530
It's the most wonderful time
of the year.

24:34.530 --> 24:36.370
Santa?

24:40.940 --> 24:44.380
I can't believe you're real.
Well, of course you can.

24:44.380 --> 24:46.010
You see,
my dear Hope,

24:46.010 --> 24:48.280
belief is what
makes things real.

24:48.280 --> 24:49.380
Uh...

24:49.380 --> 24:50.520
Yes?

24:50.520 --> 24:52.950
How did you
know her name?

24:52.950 --> 24:55.450
Because everyone
was a child once,

24:55.450 --> 24:57.960
and I remember
each and every one.

24:57.960 --> 25:01.660
Besides, a name like Alaric
is pretty tough to forget.

25:01.660 --> 25:04.030
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

25:04.030 --> 25:06.660
(laughing)

25:06.660 --> 25:08.330
I-I must thank all of you

25:08.330 --> 25:10.300
for bringing
me back.

25:10.300 --> 25:12.000
It's been hard, all these years,

25:12.000 --> 25:15.270
being trapped in that awful,
dark place,

25:15.270 --> 25:18.710
unable to spread joy
around the world...
(screeching)

25:18.710 --> 25:21.180
(all gasping)

25:21.180 --> 25:23.280
(hissing)

25:23.280 --> 25:25.320
...because of you.

25:36.360 --> 25:37.660

that damn thing.

25:37.660 --> 25:39.460
Language, Dr. Saltzman.

25:39.460 --> 25:41.100
Don't blame yourself
for missing.

25:41.100 --> 25:43.400
The Krampus' heart
is very small,

25:43.400 --> 25:46.340
and this...

25:46.340 --> 25:48.940
is my fight.

25:50.980 --> 25:54.280
Wait, Hope, no.
You heard the man.

25:54.280 --> 25:56.550
This one's personal.

25:56.550 --> 25:59.480
So you thought you could
steal Christmas, did you?

26:00.820 --> 26:02.850
Ho, ho...

26:04.020 --> 26:06.120
...no.

26:06.120 --> 26:08.030
Leaving Hope and Josie
without having

26:08.030 --> 26:10.230
the balls to say why
was one thing,

26:10.230 --> 26:11.700
but now you're ditching Raf?

26:11.700 --> 26:13.130
As long as monsters
are after me,

26:13.130 --> 26:15.100
he's in danger, too.
I needed to find someplace

26:15.100 --> 26:16.270
where I knew
he'd be safe.

26:16.270 --> 26:18.140
So what is your plan,
Huck Finn--

26:18.140 --> 26:19.840
ride the rails?
My only plan

26:19.840 --> 26:22.870
is to make sure that nobody else
gets hurt because of me,

26:22.870 --> 26:24.880
because that really sucks.

26:26.280 --> 26:29.710
Come back to the school with me,
face Hope and Josie,

26:29.710 --> 26:31.950
and then they will
help you face

26:31.950 --> 26:34.650
whatever comes next.

26:36.890 --> 26:39.490
We all will.

26:41.890 --> 26:44.560
What do you say?

26:45.860 --> 26:47.160

(gasps)

26:48.170 --> 26:49.770

28:15.890 --> 28:18.320
I didn't think
that being with you

28:18.320 --> 28:21.420
could get any more
miserable.

28:21.420 --> 28:23.230
You are only angry

28:23.230 --> 28:26.360
because your plan
to abandon me has failed.

28:31.870 --> 28:33.500
What are you doing?

28:34.840 --> 28:36.840
Put your shirt back on.
You know, I sussed it

28:36.840 --> 28:38.370
when I was
tracking you down.

28:38.370 --> 28:40.240
That is the reason you
brought me along, wasn't it?

28:40.240 --> 28:41.910
So you could just,
what, ditch me like

28:41.910 --> 28:43.710
some unwanted puppy.

28:45.180 --> 28:47.350
I mean, more like
a perk, really.

28:47.350 --> 28:49.650
You shouldn't be
at the school.

28:49.650 --> 28:52.390
You call my friends parsnips.

28:52.390 --> 28:53.790
No, they're turnips.

28:53.790 --> 28:55.660
Okay, whatever vegetable
that they are,

28:55.660 --> 28:56.790
they don't like you.

28:56.790 --> 28:59.560
No one does.

28:59.560 --> 29:01.200
(chuckles)

29:02.630 --> 29:04.730
Except for you, Elizabeth.

29:04.730 --> 29:07.740
For the last time,

29:07.740 --> 29:11.270
I don't "fancy" you or whatever.

29:11.270 --> 29:14.410
I might even hate you,
Sebastian.

29:14.410 --> 29:17.550
You made me think
that I was crazy.

29:18.750 --> 29:20.720
Well, perhaps we both are.

29:20.720 --> 29:24.420
For I fancy you, Elizabeth.

29:27.890 --> 29:30.690
Did that line work
in the Middle Ages?

29:30.690 --> 29:32.560
Yes.
Yes, it did,

29:32.560 --> 29:34.330
as did my abdominal muscles,

29:34.330 --> 29:36.670
but all that
truly matters is that

29:36.670 --> 29:38.400
it's working now.

29:38.400 --> 29:40.540
No, it isn't.

29:40.540 --> 29:41.940
Mm, 'tis.

29:41.940 --> 29:45.440
'Tis not.
'Tis.

29:45.440 --> 29:46.880
'Tis not.

29:50.010 --> 29:51.650

29:51.650 --> 29:53.720
Okay, you

29:53.720 --> 29:55.820
are insufferable.

29:55.820 --> 29:58.020
But lucky for me,

29:58.020 --> 30:01.860
there is something called
an aneurysm spell.
Ah,

30:01.860 --> 30:03.730
which you cannot cast.

30:03.730 --> 30:05.460
Uh,

30:05.460 --> 30:07.530
not without touching me.

30:10.470 --> 30:13.000
I said

30:13.000 --> 30:15.140
put your shirt back on.

30:19.010 --> 30:20.780
Okay, you know what?
Whatever.

30:20.780 --> 30:23.880
You are forgetting that there is
a perfectly good dead phoenix

30:23.880 --> 30:26.220
in the trunk.

30:33.360 --> 30:36.430
And you are forgetting
that I am dangerous.

30:36.430 --> 30:38.530
Stop talking.

30:40.800 --> 30:43.800
Action is required.

31:06.660 --> 31:09.560
(piano playing)

31:09.560 --> 31:11.790
Can't say I expected
to talk to you again.

31:11.790 --> 31:13.660
CLARKE:
Me neither.

31:13.660 --> 31:15.400
But before I die,

31:15.400 --> 31:17.800
I wanted to tell you
that you're wrong.

31:17.800 --> 31:19.600
I don't hate you.

31:21.800 --> 31:24.070
And that the truth spell
you cast on me

31:24.070 --> 31:27.280
is still working, obviously.

31:30.450 --> 31:32.110
The snow melted.

31:32.110 --> 31:34.850
I'm assuming that means
the Krampus is dead?

31:34.850 --> 31:37.050
Yup. Santa Claus killed him.

31:37.050 --> 31:38.990
This Christmas

31:38.990 --> 31:41.020
was surprisingly violent.

31:41.020 --> 31:42.390

34:01.500 --> 34:04.430
The jury's out on all the rest.

34:04.430 --> 34:07.170
Would more copulation

stay at the school?

34:10.470 --> 34:11.740
Uh, I-I...
