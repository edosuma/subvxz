03:37.709 --> 03:39.753
This is not
a foundry worker's hand.

03:40.253 --> 03:43.882
If you work with steel,
you should be used to the heat.

04:28.311 --> 04:31.605
I want Rosta! Viktor Rosta!

04:31.773 --> 04:33.440
- He left!
- Where?

04:33.608 --> 04:36.611
Druzhba Cafe!

07:23.282 --> 07:24.783
It's getting harder.

07:24.951 --> 07:28.036
Ten years ago, no drugs.
Now we have a problem.

07:28.204 --> 07:30.997
Another 10 years, it'll be like Harlem.

07:31.165 --> 07:32.582
It'll never happen.

07:33.042 --> 07:34.751
You're wrong.

07:34.919 --> 07:36.336
You know your new nickname?

07:36.504 --> 07:39.256
The officers called you Iron Jaw...

07:39.423 --> 07:42.134
...but after the fight in the snow,
they call you Roundheaded.

07:42.301 --> 07:44.136
Actually, I'm circumcised myself.

07:50.017 --> 07:51.184
How's your cold?

07:51.352 --> 07:55.438
Awful. Did your mother teach you
any home remedies?

07:55.606 --> 07:58.650
Try holding a hot rock in your hand.

07:58.818 --> 08:02.864
All right, listen.
You go first and I'll stay behind.

08:03.031 --> 08:06.409
To make sure our men
are positioned properly.

08:06.577 --> 08:08.494
Let's get them.

09:08.432 --> 09:11.768
Everything's okay.
No problem, officer.

09:43.842 --> 09:46.386
Let's go. All of you.

09:46.804 --> 09:52.934
Why do you always
pick on us Georgians?

09:54.478 --> 09:59.233
We are just simple people.

09:59.401 --> 10:05.155
Maybe that is why
we are such easy prey.

10:05.323 --> 10:07.741
What's this country coming to?!

10:08.702 --> 10:11.245
This is like the old days!

10:11.413 --> 10:14.581
We are not guilty of anything!

10:14.749 --> 10:16.750
Where is your evidence?

12:07.407 --> 12:10.075
I got his brother in the leg.

12:54.539 --> 12:57.666
Freeze! You are under arrest!

12:57.834 --> 12:59.168
Drop your gun!

12:59.335 --> 13:01.128
Now!

13:02.297 --> 13:05.090
Handcuffs would be a good Idea.

14:22.045 --> 14:23.254
Our informants...

14:23.421 --> 14:29.176
...say Rosta fled the county
with two other criminals...

14:30.512 --> 14:35.099
...Josip Baroda
and Pytor Tatamovich.

14:36.851 --> 14:38.310
We'll find him.

14:38.478 --> 14:42.273
He'll pay far his crimes
against the people.

15:25.693 --> 15:27.402
Abdul Elijah says we're in business.

15:27.570 --> 15:30.447
Get the capital in a safe place
as previously discussed, dig?

15:30.615 --> 15:31.823
Meet me back here at 3:00.

15:31.991 --> 15:34.659
You bring me a key.
We go check the color of your green.

15:34.827 --> 15:37.579
Your shipment's on its way.
You have a small item for me.

15:37.747 --> 15:39.247
I give you a courier?

15:39.707 --> 15:41.541
Bless Abdul Elijah
and the brotherhood.

15:41.709 --> 15:44.044
Nice doing business with you,
comrade.

16:16.621 --> 16:18.205
We're in business.

16:26.923 --> 16:28.006
Attention.

16:28.174 --> 16:32.386
Fun bag patrol.
Double bogies, 11 o'clock.

16:32.845 --> 16:35.055
Christ.

16:35.515 --> 16:37.641
You think she bought those?
I don't think so.

16:37.809 --> 16:40.018
I don't think so.
I think those are homegrown.

16:40.186 --> 16:41.561
Yeah, definitely homegrown.

16:41.729 --> 16:43.355
Art.

16:44.400 --> 16:46.317
Just an opinion.

16:46.902 --> 16:49.320
Jesus.

16:51.031 --> 16:54.242
- Guy's gotta be dead not to notice.
- What's the matter with you?

16:54.410 --> 16:56.327
I'm a man. I got needs.

16:56.495 --> 16:59.122
Chrissakes, we're on the job.
Come on.

16:59.415 --> 17:01.457
We ought to arrest her.

17:07.256 --> 17:11.134
- What'd you squeeze him with?
- Caught him packing on parole.

17:11.300 --> 17:13.176
Gave him a choice:
Whisper in my ear...

17:13.345 --> 17:16.222
...or I turn him into Miss Joliet
for the next three to five.

17:16.390 --> 17:18.141
He tipped you
to a big cleanhead deal?

17:18.308 --> 17:22.103
Man, don't tell me we're popping
cleanheads. I hate the cleanheads.

17:22.271 --> 17:24.063
You are this close to losing your job.

17:24.231 --> 17:26.941
Can you just give us a second,
Charlie?

17:27.608 --> 17:29.485
Yeah, right.

17:31.780 --> 17:33.698
You're not helping yourself here, Art.

17:33.866 --> 17:36.784
This is a good tip.
I got it from my guy, Streak.

17:38.454 --> 17:42.166
All right. Come on, let's go.

17:53.636 --> 17:56.305
- Freeze!
- Freeze! Police! Hands up!

17:58.016 --> 17:59.308
Shut up!

17:59.476 --> 18:01.185
You ain't got shit.

18:10.195 --> 18:12.322
Follow me. You have the right
to remain silent.

18:12.490 --> 18:15.158
Anything you say can be used
against you in court.

18:15.326 --> 18:17.160
You have the right to talk to a...

18:24.126 --> 18:25.335
Outside stairwell.

18:52.280 --> 18:54.406
Freeze, motherfucker!

18:56.034 --> 18:58.744
Don't get nervous. I do this for a living.

19:01.331 --> 19:03.207
You look like Marvin Hagler to me.

19:03.375 --> 19:05.793
I lost money on Hagler!

19:20.851 --> 19:22.893
Hey! How long
you gonna be in there, man?

19:23.061 --> 19:25.855
You're not even using
the goddamn phone.

19:27.732 --> 19:29.191
Jerk.

20:36.804 --> 20:39.598
Yes, top priority.
I'm expecting confirmation.

20:39.766 --> 20:42.893
We'll take extreme precaution.

20:43.728 --> 20:46.813
Take this to Colonel Kulikov
immediately.

20:46.981 --> 20:49.149
Then send for Captain Danko.

20:49.317 --> 20:52.277
He is to report as soon as possible.

20:52.904 --> 20:55.280
Good news, comrade.

20:55.448 --> 20:57.658
America.

20:58.785 --> 21:01.411
Chicago. Gangster.

21:13.007 --> 21:17.594
You are being given
a great responsibility, captain.

21:18.638 --> 21:22.015
Viktor has been arrested
for a minor offense.

21:22.183 --> 21:25.435
His two accomplices
are still at large.

21:26.396 --> 21:31.942
Viktor was organizing a huge
cocaine shipment from America.

21:32.110 --> 21:35.905
Our informants say
5 million dollars' worth.

21:36.657 --> 21:38.825
Bring Viktor home.

21:38.993 --> 21:42.537
Bring him home.
But don't tell the Americans.

21:42.705 --> 21:45.081
I repeat, tell the Americans nothing.

21:45.249 --> 21:47.250
Do not discuss our problems.

21:47.418 --> 21:49.210
Bring Viktor to us.

21:49.378 --> 21:51.587
We will avenge Yuri...

21:51.755 --> 21:57.385
...and protect ourselves
from the poison of the West.

21:58.220 --> 22:00.221
Trust me.

22:12.235 --> 22:17.072
O'Hare skybus leaving for downtown
in five minutes.

22:17.824 --> 22:19.575
- How you doing, honey?
- Blow yourself.

22:19.743 --> 22:23.245
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Good thinking.

22:24.748 --> 22:26.457
He should be out any second.

22:26.624 --> 22:29.168
He's going through customs right now.

22:29.335 --> 22:31.879
You read the report Stobbs wrote
on the cleanhead bust?

22:32.047 --> 22:34.758
Yeah. He said your performance
was adequate.

22:34.925 --> 22:37.469
Adequate. Jesus Christ.
What a jerk.

22:37.636 --> 22:39.804
- It's a personality thing, Art.
- Yeah.

22:39.972 --> 22:42.223
Stobbs just doesn't like yours.

22:48.397 --> 22:50.940
Ten to one
he doesn't speak English.

22:55.946 --> 22:58.364
- Captain Danko.
- Yes.

22:58.532 --> 23:02.118
I'm Detective Sergeant Gallagher,
Chicago Police Department.

23:02.286 --> 23:04.287
- Glad to meet you.
- Thank you.

23:05.039 --> 23:07.916
This is my partner,
Detective Sergeant Ridzik.

23:11.003 --> 23:13.797
- First time in Chicago?
- Yes.

23:14.298 --> 23:17.634
- You have a nice flight?
- Yes, fine.

23:18.427 --> 23:20.637
- You hungry?
- No.

23:20.805 --> 23:21.971
- Thirsty?
- No.

23:22.139 --> 23:25.850
Hate to break up this romance,
but I'm parked in a red zone.

23:26.018 --> 23:27.977
No offense.

23:28.229 --> 23:30.647
We got a car waiting outside
for you.

23:31.691 --> 23:33.651
Be about a half-hour drive to the city.

23:33.819 --> 23:36.987
It's a nice drive. You'll enjoy it.

23:38.115 --> 23:39.323
Nice night.

23:39.491 --> 23:41.242
Been real hot lately.

23:41.409 --> 23:44.495
Nothing hotter
than Chicago in August.

23:44.663 --> 23:47.456
It's the humidity that gets to you.

23:48.416 --> 23:51.669
Humidity.
You know, moisture in the air.

23:55.006 --> 23:56.507
How's it been in Moscow?

23:56.675 --> 23:58.134
Hot.

23:58.510 --> 24:00.595
No moisture.

24:01.722 --> 24:03.849
Where'd you learn to speak English
so well?

24:04.016 --> 24:05.475
Army.

24:05.643 --> 24:09.187
Compulsory training.
Language school in Kiev.

24:09.355 --> 24:12.691
Oh, yeah.
That's like as in Chicken Kiev.

24:13.109 --> 24:15.819
Yeah, we had that
at my sister's wedding.

24:16.946 --> 24:20.490
This Viktor Rosta, he must've
pissed off quite a few commissars...

24:20.658 --> 24:23.869
...for them to send someone all
this way just to babysit him home.

24:24.036 --> 24:27.038
What did he do? Take a leak
on the Kremlin Wall or something?

24:30.502 --> 24:33.504
I gotta apologize for my partner,
captain.

24:33.672 --> 24:35.798
You see,
he's just naturally suspicious.

24:35.966 --> 24:37.466
Did you arrest Viktor?

24:37.634 --> 24:40.386
Me? No, it was a couple
of our patrolmen.

24:40.554 --> 24:42.054
Where?

24:42.222 --> 24:45.224
Right near his hotel, actually,
The Garvin.

24:45.392 --> 24:48.394
Yeah, it's a breeding ground
for pushers, pimps, prostitutes.

24:48.562 --> 24:50.855
- You know, anybody...
- Take me there.

24:51.064 --> 24:53.441
We got you booked
at the Executive House.

24:53.609 --> 24:56.194
Please. Garvin.

25:02.576 --> 25:05.578
You sure you wanna stay here?
It's the pits. You have a choice.

25:05.746 --> 25:07.622
I stay here.

25:08.540 --> 25:11.334
- If you're on a budget I can talk to my...
- Thank you.

25:11.501 --> 25:14.754
- I will be fine.
- Okay.

25:14.922 --> 25:16.672
You're the boss.

25:17.299 --> 25:20.927
I'll pick you up around
9:00 in the morning, okay?

25:21.887 --> 25:24.555
Hey, nice talking to you, captain.

25:30.647 --> 25:34.066
- What do you think, Art?
- I think he's a jerk.

25:42.200 --> 25:45.077
- Danko.
- You're welcome.

25:56.214 --> 25:58.800
Put your name in the big book
right there.

26:01.220 --> 26:04.389
You had man here called Rosta.

26:04.556 --> 26:06.599
Viktor Rosta.

26:06.767 --> 26:09.560
- A Russian?
- Soviet.

26:09.979 --> 26:12.230
I want same room.

26:12.398 --> 26:13.731
Are you Russian too?

26:19.280 --> 26:20.989
Nice going.

26:23.200 --> 26:26.829
It's 302.

26:26.997 --> 26:29.290
Right up the stairs.

27:20.342 --> 27:22.051
Capitalism.

27:43.491 --> 27:45.909
And this is our booking area.

27:47.119 --> 27:50.413
Looks like a major crime wave
just hit, right?

27:50.581 --> 27:54.126
When I first walked in here when
they assigned me to this district...

27:54.294 --> 27:57.713
...I thought all hell had broken loose.

27:58.090 --> 28:02.343
Nope.
It was just a typical Monday morning.

28:02.511 --> 28:04.303
Is that a Russian cop uniform?

28:04.471 --> 28:07.473
Looks like a glorified postman
or something out of World War Two.

28:07.641 --> 28:10.684
- Be respectful to our guest, Audrey.
- Yes, sir.

28:11.853 --> 28:13.604
Not king.

28:14.481 --> 28:16.607
Checkmate in two moves.

28:16.775 --> 28:19.360
Use bishop to queen four.

28:19.861 --> 28:22.781
Thanks for your advice, comrade,
but I think I got it covered.

28:24.033 --> 28:25.409
This way, captain.

28:26.953 --> 28:28.537
The nerve of that guy.

28:30.373 --> 28:32.207
Captain Danko, Moscow Militia.

28:32.375 --> 28:35.293
This is Commander Donnelly,
chief of this district.

28:35.461 --> 28:38.672
Thanks, Tom. The captain
will be with you in a minute.

28:43.428 --> 28:47.472
This is an extradition order.
All it requires is your signature.

28:47.640 --> 28:50.267
He ran a red light.
Didn't have a valid driver's license.

28:50.435 --> 28:53.645
Arresting officer found a gun
in his glove box, brought him in.

28:53.813 --> 28:56.565
We shook him down.
Then he refused to speak English.

28:56.732 --> 28:59.234
We found the Cyrillic
tattooed across his shoulders...

28:59.402 --> 29:01.987
...we figured out he was one of yours.

29:03.030 --> 29:05.532
Viktor did not ask for political asylum?

29:05.700 --> 29:07.742
I think he's resigned to going home.

29:11.164 --> 29:14.124
Audrey, go get Sergeant Ridzik,
will you?

29:14.292 --> 29:15.792
Right.

29:21.967 --> 29:24.302
Stress management.

29:24.553 --> 29:26.262
You watch the fishes.

29:26.430 --> 29:27.930
You water the plants.

29:28.098 --> 29:31.517
Special breathing exercises.
Monitor your blood pressure.

29:31.685 --> 29:34.353
Listen to pleasant sounds.

29:36.190 --> 29:38.191
Relax.

29:38.358 --> 29:41.569
Personally, I think
it may all be a pile of shit.

29:41.820 --> 29:46.032
But when you're facing a bypass,
you stop asking questions.

29:49.203 --> 29:55.375
Look, just out of curiosity, and since
I figure cops are cops the world over...

29:55.877 --> 29:58.795
...how do you Soviets
deal with all the tension and stress?

30:00.131 --> 30:01.757
Vodka.

30:03.968 --> 30:05.010
Yes, sir.

30:05.178 --> 30:09.389
Art, I want you to ride with Gallagher
and the captain here to the city jail.

30:09.557 --> 30:13.018
Make sure he signs this form before
he and Gallagher go to the airport.

30:13.186 --> 30:14.895
Then bring the top copy back here.

30:15.063 --> 30:19.317
- Well, you're probably want...
- Just bring the top form back to me.

30:20.110 --> 30:22.570
- Yes, sir.
- That'll make it official.

30:22.738 --> 30:26.366
So long, captain.
Nice doing business with you.

30:26.534 --> 30:29.577
- Gallagher! Taxi service.
- Right.

30:41.507 --> 30:43.174
Stand up.

30:50.099 --> 30:52.600
I'm taking you home.

30:53.060 --> 30:54.769
Eat shit.

30:56.689 --> 30:58.231
You can tell they're old buddies.

30:58.399 --> 31:01.067
Body language
is a beautiful thing, isn't it?

31:02.820 --> 31:04.529
We are ready.

31:05.447 --> 31:07.115
Yes, sir.

31:20.922 --> 31:22.715
What is this key to?

31:22.882 --> 31:25.718
Kiss my ass.

31:26.177 --> 31:30.055
- Do you know what this key opens?
- Looks like a key to a locker to me.

31:30.223 --> 31:32.558
Why don't you ask your bud?

31:33.852 --> 31:35.561
You try it.

31:41.067 --> 31:43.819
Where is the locker...

31:43.987 --> 31:47.449
...that this key opens?

31:51.370 --> 31:53.246
- What'd he say?
- He say:

31:53.414 --> 31:56.499
"Go and kiss your mother's behind."

32:00.338 --> 32:02.839
You son of a bitch! Come here!

32:03.007 --> 32:05.133
- Stupid motherfucker!
- Take it easy!

32:05.301 --> 32:08.553
- All right, all right, I'm fine! Fine.
- For God's sakes.

32:08.721 --> 32:10.764
- Take it easy.
- All right, all right.

32:10.931 --> 32:13.600
- Take it easy.
- I'm fine. It happens all the time.

32:13.768 --> 32:17.313
Every day someone tells me
to go fuck my mother's ass.

32:18.857 --> 32:22.109
- Have you seen my mother's ass?
- No, I haven't seen your mother's ass.

32:22.277 --> 32:24.528
Well, you'd want to fuck it too.

32:32.204 --> 32:34.038
He shouldn't have said that
about my mom.

32:34.206 --> 32:37.750
What do you care what he says?
It's not your case, Art. It's not my case.

32:37.918 --> 32:40.920
- It's not even an American case.
- Right, right, right.

32:41.088 --> 32:44.840
We're just an escort service here,
Jesus. Pull back on your emotions.

32:45.008 --> 32:47.468
You heard what he said.
How can I let that pass?

32:47.636 --> 32:49.970
- Find a middle ground, Art.
- Yeah.

32:50.138 --> 32:52.264
This way, clown.

33:07.030 --> 33:09.115
All right, I'm out of here.

33:09.282 --> 33:11.784
Look, captain,
you have a good flight back, all right?

33:11.952 --> 33:15.539
And if you get a chance
to flush this turd down the toilet...

33:15.707 --> 33:17.708
...do it over the Pole.

33:17.875 --> 33:21.378
By the way, you were right about
that chess move. I was dead in two.

33:21.546 --> 33:23.672
It was obvious.

33:31.931 --> 33:35.308
Forgive Ridzik, captain.
He's been having a hard time lately.

33:35.476 --> 33:38.687
- Put himself in a jam...
- I try to forget Ridzik.

33:47.573 --> 33:48.740
- Hey, Bernie.
- Yes, sir.

33:48.907 --> 33:51.451
Yeah, give me a Sun Times
and a Racing Action tip sheet.

33:51.618 --> 33:53.286
Yes, sir.

33:53.454 --> 33:54.620
You got a winner?

34:10.804 --> 34:12.054
Move!

34:12.223 --> 34:14.099
- Come on, let's move!
- I need the key!

34:18.605 --> 34:19.813
Come on, man!

34:19.981 --> 34:22.483
- Let's go, let's go!
- Move it. Let's move it, damn it!

35:31.637 --> 35:35.849
- Well, how's he doing, doctor?
- It's still a little early.

35:36.016 --> 35:39.394
There's no fracture, but Captain
Danko does have a concussion.

35:39.563 --> 35:41.939
Well, we're gonna need him
to make a full statement.

35:42.107 --> 35:45.317
Well, I don't think you should plan
on getting much out of him today.

35:45.944 --> 35:47.736
Thank you very much.

36:07.382 --> 36:09.926
Gallagher didn't even get a shot off.

36:10.428 --> 36:12.345
I think it was
the cleanheads who did it.

36:12.513 --> 36:15.015
That's possible.
They all walked yesterday morning.

36:15.182 --> 36:16.308
Illegal warrant.

36:16.475 --> 36:18.351
- Even the guy with the shotgun?
- You bet.

36:18.519 --> 36:21.646
Walked right out the door with
a great big handshake from the judge.

36:21.814 --> 36:23.273
- Shit.
- Get a load of this.

36:23.441 --> 36:25.108
- This guy you nailed in here.
- Yeah.

36:25.276 --> 36:27.777
According to his ID,
he's another Russian.

36:27.945 --> 36:29.613
Can you believe that?

36:29.780 --> 36:33.617
Comrade Captain Danko,
this is Comrade Consul Stepanovich.

36:33.784 --> 36:36.453
I am Moussorsky,
your liaison officer.

36:36.621 --> 36:38.622
We're here from Washington.

36:38.789 --> 36:42.292
We took the first flight
when we heard the news.

36:42.460 --> 36:44.336
We need to know what happened.

36:44.503 --> 36:47.797
Moscow must get a full report
when we return to Washington.

36:47.965 --> 36:49.841
There's nothing to report.

36:50.009 --> 36:52.886
Your attitude is disappointing.

36:53.137 --> 36:56.973
He got away.
Get the details from the Americans.

36:57.141 --> 37:02.062
They ask too many questions.
It could be an embarrassment.

37:02.229 --> 37:04.606
Rosta escaped
because of your stupidity.

37:04.982 --> 37:09.278
Rosta will finish his deal
and send the American poison home...

37:09.446 --> 37:11.781
...through his Georgian network.

37:11.990 --> 37:15.493
We are humiliated before the world.

37:15.661 --> 37:18.037
You've failed.

37:18.205 --> 37:20.581
Report whatever you want.

37:20.749 --> 37:23.834
I've already cabled Internal Affairs.

37:24.002 --> 37:28.798
Take the first plane to Moscow
when you leave the hospital.

37:29.341 --> 37:32.301
Your superiors want to see you...

37:32.469 --> 37:34.679
...the moment you land.

37:45.024 --> 37:48.527
I'm sorry, but the police department
will have to bear with us, lieutenant.

37:48.695 --> 37:51.530
Captain Danko
should remain incommunicado.

37:51.698 --> 37:53.949
The Russians got a chance
to talk to him. Why?

37:54.117 --> 37:56.034
They were the closest thing
to family...

37:56.202 --> 37:58.537
...and they didn't intend
to interrogate him.

38:02.208 --> 38:05.086
Now, how did you get that piece
through customs?

38:05.713 --> 38:07.964
Diplomatic immunity.

38:08.132 --> 38:12.218
Great. That restores my faith
in airport security.

38:12.386 --> 38:15.388
You're not supposed to have that gun,
Danko.

38:15.723 --> 38:17.724
I'll tell you what, though.

38:18.475 --> 38:21.894
Tell me what the hell's going on
with Viktor, I'll let you keep the piece.

38:22.062 --> 38:23.521
Take it.

38:23.689 --> 38:25.732
Come on, give me a break
with this shit, huh?

38:25.899 --> 38:30.194
Maybe this Russian bully stuff
works on a chessboard, but not here.

38:30.571 --> 38:32.321
What, are you retiring your uniform?

38:32.489 --> 38:34.407
I now work undercover.

38:35.159 --> 38:36.826
Undercover?

38:36.994 --> 38:38.995
You look like Gumby.

38:39.163 --> 38:41.080
Yeah, you're gonna fit right in.

38:43.083 --> 38:46.627
For your information, captain,
I bagged one of your Russians.

38:46.795 --> 38:50.506
Unfortunately, he's not dead.
He's in the intensive care unit.

38:50.674 --> 38:52.925
When he comes to,
maybe you should talk to him.

38:53.093 --> 38:54.927
How long before this happens?

38:55.095 --> 38:58.264
What is this, 60 Minutes?
Do I look like a doctor to you?

38:59.183 --> 39:01.559
Other things first.

39:02.853 --> 39:05.355
Hey, Gumby? Hey.

39:06.024 --> 39:07.483
Where do you think you're going?

39:07.650 --> 39:11.195
All right, lighten up.
Lighten up, I got it. Thanks.

39:11.362 --> 39:14.656
- Hey, what are you doing out of bed?
- He thinks he's gonna find Viktor.

39:14.824 --> 39:17.284
- That's cute. You keep an eye on him.
- Why me?

39:17.452 --> 39:20.996
Because I said so. He's a material
witness. I'm gonna talk to Donnelly.

39:21.164 --> 39:23.999
- He can figure what to do.
- How come I get all the shit jobs?

39:24.167 --> 39:26.043
- Because it fits you, Ridzik.
- Yeah.

39:26.211 --> 39:29.588
- You come with me, yes?
- Well, you heard. I just got my orders.

39:29.756 --> 39:33.051
- Take me to the same hotel.
- Do I look like a fucking cab to you?

39:33.219 --> 39:34.803
Yes.

39:38.724 --> 39:41.142
All right, all I did
was take him back to the hotel.

39:41.310 --> 39:43.478
He went in, came out 10 minutes later.

39:43.771 --> 39:46.439
I don't know what to do with him,
so I brought him here.

39:46.607 --> 39:48.817
Okay. Good.

39:49.110 --> 39:52.904
About your involvement in this thing,
you know the standard procedure.

39:53.072 --> 39:56.991
If you're a witness to a murder, you can
no longer be active in the investigation.

39:57.159 --> 40:00.286
- But I think this is gonna be a little...
- Okay, okay, I know.

40:00.454 --> 40:02.915
I'm not taking you off the case.

40:03.083 --> 40:05.459
You and Gallagher were friends.

40:05.627 --> 40:07.837
I'll fit you in somehow.

40:09.422 --> 40:10.798
Send in Danko.

40:17.514 --> 40:20.641
The two Russian suits
that showed up out at the hospital.

40:20.809 --> 40:22.685
They want Danko.
Want him in a big way.

40:22.853 --> 40:26.021
So I told them we'd put him on a plane
as soon as possible.

40:29.192 --> 40:31.318
Please be seated, captain.

40:31.486 --> 40:33.696
You've met Lieutenant Stobbs?

40:33.864 --> 40:35.990
Stobbs is the point man
in this investigation.

40:36.158 --> 40:40.202
We met. I'd like to run this by you,
captain.

40:43.248 --> 40:46.750
"Viktor Rosta.
Full name, Viktor Sedgavich Rostavili.

40:46.918 --> 40:51.130
Born September 4, 1944.
Georgia, Russia.

40:51.298 --> 40:54.425
His father had the distinction
of being hanged by the U.S.S. R...

40:54.593 --> 40:57.344
...for the crime of brigandage."

40:57.512 --> 40:59.013
Brigandage?

41:00.933 --> 41:04.019
Burning villages, raping women.

41:04.562 --> 41:06.688
That sort of thing goes on
in Russia, huh?

41:06.856 --> 41:09.065
In past, during war.

41:09.233 --> 41:10.525
Not now.

41:11.152 --> 41:12.903
According to you. According to this...

41:13.070 --> 41:14.988
...Viktor spent three years
in the army...

41:15.156 --> 41:18.366
...and six on a forced labor camp
for drug offenses.

41:18.534 --> 41:21.077
"Is currently wanted in the U.S.S. R...

41:21.245 --> 41:24.247
...on the charges of murder,
kidnapping, rape...

41:24.415 --> 41:29.670
...extortion, currency speculation
and drug dealing."

41:29.838 --> 41:31.756
Where did you get this information?

41:31.924 --> 41:33.132
Your boys in Washington...

41:33.300 --> 41:36.427
...have decided to be incredibly
cooperative since Viktor split.

41:36.595 --> 41:38.596
In fact, they got a whole new attitude.

41:38.764 --> 41:41.515
I hear they're sending over
some caviar later.

41:45.187 --> 41:47.104
Why didn't you tell us this before?

41:47.272 --> 41:50.608
- I had no authorization.
- Bullshit.

41:51.276 --> 41:54.946
My government does not like
to do laundry in public.

41:55.113 --> 41:57.281
Is there anything else
we should know about?

41:58.368 --> 42:01.912
I will not leave this country
without Viktor.

42:02.747 --> 42:04.915
I need cooperation.

42:07.293 --> 42:08.919
Okay.

42:09.629 --> 42:11.338
You wanna stick around...

42:11.506 --> 42:14.967
...and find Viktor, captain,
that's fine by me.

42:18.137 --> 42:19.930
One more thing, captain.

42:20.390 --> 42:22.391
I don't want the press to get near you.

42:22.558 --> 42:25.560
And I don't want you rolling
through this town like the Red Army.

42:30.858 --> 42:32.234
Have you wigged out?

42:32.986 --> 42:37.155
Danko is the perfect weapon, Charlie:
A loose cannon.

42:37.323 --> 42:40.242
If he helps us find Viktor Rosta, great.

42:40.410 --> 42:44.162
If he screws up, breaks rules
along the way, he's a Russian.

42:44.539 --> 42:47.666
- But what about Ridzik?
- Ridzik is a good cop.

42:47.834 --> 42:50.168
And a total expert at fucking up.

42:51.004 --> 42:55.424
Departmentally speaking,
I got no downside here.

42:55.591 --> 42:57.677
I have them bringing
Gallagher's snitch...

42:57.845 --> 43:01.222
...the guy who helped us with the bust
on the cleanheads the other day.

43:01.390 --> 43:03.933
He's a sleazy shit,
but if we can get him to talk...

43:04.101 --> 43:07.020
...I think he can tell us
who's brokering the cleanheads deal.

43:07.187 --> 43:08.855
This man visits Viktor in jail?

43:09.023 --> 43:10.690
Only two folks had that honor:

43:10.858 --> 43:14.193
A skirt named Cat Manzetti
and that Russian I shot.

43:14.361 --> 43:17.363
All right, the girl teaches dance
in Wicker Park for the city.

43:17.531 --> 43:20.533
We're gonna try to catch up with her
later on tonight, all right?

43:20.701 --> 43:23.161
About this pile of shit pimp in here.

43:23.329 --> 43:26.832
In this country, we try
to protect the rights of individuals.

43:27.000 --> 43:31.170
It's called the Miranda Act, and it says
that you can't even touch his ass.

43:31.338 --> 43:35.215
I do not want to touch his ass.
I want to make him talk.

43:36.593 --> 43:38.510
I'm gonna handle this one, okay?

43:46.227 --> 43:47.853
Hey, Streak.

43:48.021 --> 43:50.564
- You can't hold me here, dickweed.
- Hostility.

43:50.732 --> 43:52.649
You got nothing on me.
This is bullshit!

43:52.817 --> 43:55.570
- Easy.
- Where is Viktor?

43:55.738 --> 43:57.906
What are you doing?
Will you be civilized?

43:58.074 --> 44:01.701
I don't know who he thinks he is.
I'll have both your badges for brutality.

44:01.869 --> 44:04.829
Easy, Streak. Just sit down, relax.

44:04.997 --> 44:07.916
Now, we wanna ask you a couple
questions about the cleanheads.

44:08.334 --> 44:10.710
Fair price for services rendered?

44:10.878 --> 44:13.296
Capitalism works, right, Streak?

44:13.464 --> 44:18.093
Cleanheads got a monster deal going
down. I told Gallagher. End of story.

44:18.260 --> 44:19.928
He lies.

44:20.096 --> 44:23.098
In this country,
he has that God-given right.

44:26.644 --> 44:28.812
Do I smell heroin?

44:29.605 --> 44:31.064
- What's this?
- Come on, man.

44:31.232 --> 44:33.942
- You bring this into the police station?
- You planted that.

44:34.110 --> 44:37.195
That's disrespectful.
This is distribution weight.

44:37.363 --> 44:38.446
Fucking cop setup.

44:38.614 --> 44:40.698
You're fired.
You know who I got on retainer?

44:40.866 --> 44:42.617
Cleanheads deal:
Who, when and where?

44:42.785 --> 44:45.495
The lawyer I got makes ACLU
look like Nazis.

44:45.663 --> 44:47.622
He lives for cop misconduct like this.

44:47.790 --> 44:49.916
- Probably sue you for fucking free.
- Yeah?

44:50.084 --> 44:52.502
And I ain't telling you shit.

44:54.881 --> 44:56.340
Jesus! Oh, shit!

44:56.508 --> 44:59.802
Okay, Abdul Elijah's running the deal
from Joliet.

44:59.970 --> 45:02.721
Shit's coming in in a couple of days.
I don't know where.

45:02.889 --> 45:06.225
I swear on my balls,
I don't know where.

45:11.356 --> 45:14.316
Soviet method is more economical.

45:14.985 --> 45:19.822
I'm so glad I took the time
to explain to you an individual's rights.

45:21.700 --> 45:23.243
Streak.

45:24.454 --> 45:28.039
Sorry about that hand.
You gotta watch these doorjambs.

45:28.207 --> 45:29.916
They're dangerous.

45:31.335 --> 45:33.628
Breaking his goddamn fingers
right in front of me.

45:33.796 --> 45:36.548
You can't pull a stunt like that.
You fucking ignored me.

45:36.716 --> 45:38.008
- Miranda?
- Yes, Miranda.

45:38.176 --> 45:40.802
In your country,
it's okay to lie and put drug in pocket?

45:40.970 --> 45:43.180
Okay, okay, no, not really.

45:43.347 --> 45:45.891
Okay, maybe I was a little
out of line there, all right?

45:46.058 --> 45:48.351
I was just trying to get him to talk,
that's all.

45:48.519 --> 45:50.812
I mean, I wasn't gonna
prosecute the guy.

45:50.980 --> 45:52.648
We both go too far.

45:52.816 --> 45:56.736
Shit. All I know is Gallagher's dead,
your Russian's on the loose...

45:56.904 --> 45:59.655
...and I gotta chauffeur you around
all goddamn day.

45:59.823 --> 46:01.782
You know, it really sucks.

46:01.950 --> 46:04.827
Who is Abdul Elijah?

46:04.995 --> 46:08.456
He's got one of the biggest
criminal organizations going right now.

46:08.624 --> 46:11.209
- Where can we find him?
- In jail.

46:11.710 --> 46:13.377
Miranda Law is there?

46:13.921 --> 46:16.172
Yes. Miranda is there.

46:16.340 --> 46:19.467
Even scumbags have rights
in this country. I told you.

46:19.635 --> 46:24.263
In Soviet Union, only after two days
can scumbag talk to lawyer.

46:24.431 --> 46:26.224
You're shitting me.

46:26.391 --> 46:28.684
I am not shitting on you.

46:28.852 --> 46:30.561
We go see Abdul? Yes?

46:30.729 --> 46:35.399
Sure. Whatever you say, Gumby.
I'm your escort.

46:37.611 --> 46:39.570
That suit's not gonna explode
or anything?

46:39.738 --> 46:42.365
- I think you're safe.
- Just checking.

46:42.533 --> 46:45.910
Once I lock one of these fuckers up,
the gangs take over.

46:46.078 --> 46:49.414
You got the Aryan brotherhood,
the cleanheads, the Muslims.

46:49.582 --> 46:52.417
Since most of these convicts
are repeaters...

46:52.585 --> 46:54.753
...gang leader's got connection
to the outside.

46:54.921 --> 46:56.672
Criminal operation.

47:04.514 --> 47:06.265
Cleanheads' playground.

47:06.432 --> 47:10.269
- From now on, you're on your own.
- Thanks.

47:11.521 --> 47:15.607
There he is. Abdul Elijah.
Sitting on his throne with his cronies.

47:15.775 --> 47:18.570
He makes them shave their heads
to prove their obedience.

47:19.196 --> 47:22.115
I guess the rules are different
for the bosses.

47:22.533 --> 47:24.909
Kind of like your government,
huh, Ivan?

47:25.452 --> 47:26.578
Come here, you.

47:26.745 --> 47:28.496
I wanna talk to you.

47:29.164 --> 47:30.456
This is Captain Ivan Danko.

47:30.624 --> 47:33.376
He's come from Russia
to speak to your scoutmaster.

47:33.544 --> 47:35.795
Well, that's nice,
but who the fuck are you?

47:35.963 --> 47:39.799
These men have no respect
of our authority as police officers.

47:39.967 --> 47:41.217
No shit.

47:41.385 --> 47:44.137
Revolutionary political leaders,
like myself...

47:44.305 --> 47:46.806
...are incarcerated to keep us quiet.

47:46.974 --> 47:49.810
What is your political crime?

47:49.978 --> 47:51.812
I robbed a bank.

47:52.397 --> 47:56.317
Now, let's get to it, Mr. Moscow.
What is it you want?

47:56.735 --> 47:57.985
I have Viktor's key.

47:58.153 --> 48:00.654
If that's true,
then you also have Viktor's money...

48:00.822 --> 48:02.948
...and all you need is half
a hundred dollar bill...

48:03.116 --> 48:05.284
...then you and me are in business.

48:05.452 --> 48:08.579
I give you key, you give me Viktor.

48:09.247 --> 48:10.831
That isn't ethical.

48:13.043 --> 48:15.169
You keep cocaine.

48:16.463 --> 48:21.925
Man. You're trying to make me
compromise my principles.

48:22.093 --> 48:24.386
We are not like American police.

48:24.554 --> 48:28.891
You ship drugs to my country,
and one morning you will wake up...

48:29.059 --> 48:32.978
...and find your testicles floating
in jars of water next to your bed.

48:33.146 --> 48:37.566
I'm a holy man.
I got no need for testicles.

48:37.734 --> 48:40.611
Then I settle for your eyes.

48:41.321 --> 48:44.698
You can't threaten me, white boy.

48:48.162 --> 48:52.040
You want to know what my crime is?
My crime was being born.

48:52.208 --> 48:56.044
I'm 38 years old
and I've been locked up 26 of those.

48:56.212 --> 48:58.588
I educated myself in here.

48:58.756 --> 49:03.677
I've come to understand this country
was built on exploiting the black man.

49:04.136 --> 49:07.222
Of course, I don't hear anything
about brothers in your country.

49:07.390 --> 49:10.016
But your country
exploits its own people just the same.

49:10.184 --> 49:14.813
So I guess that makes me
the only Marxist around here...

49:14.981 --> 49:16.524
...right, comrade?

49:17.067 --> 49:19.235
You see, this ain't just no drug deal.

49:19.403 --> 49:21.696
This is politics, baby.
This is economics.

49:21.863 --> 49:23.781
This is spiritual.

49:23.949 --> 49:26.409
I plan to sell drugs...

49:26.576 --> 49:29.412
...to every white man in the world...

49:30.038 --> 49:32.248
...and his sister.

49:35.335 --> 49:36.877
I still want Viktor Rosta.

49:37.045 --> 49:40.589
- Yeah, real bad. I can tell.
- Where can I find him?

49:40.757 --> 49:44.803
I tell you what I am gonna do, captain.

49:45.680 --> 49:47.764
I'm gonna put you
two white boys together...

49:47.932 --> 49:50.434
...see if you can't
work this thing out.

49:50.601 --> 49:51.935
I need Viktor.

49:52.103 --> 49:54.354
And he needs that key.

49:54.939 --> 49:56.440
And you.

49:57.775 --> 50:02.362
You're just another motherfucker
we gonna have to deal with.

50:04.323 --> 50:06.199
Be cool.

50:18.087 --> 50:20.714
Okay, so tell me. How did it go?

50:20.882 --> 50:23.383
- Fine.
- Fine?

50:23.551 --> 50:24.885
You wanna cut the shit?

50:25.052 --> 50:26.970
You were talking
to that jazzbo so long...

50:27.138 --> 50:29.055
...I thought about having
my head shaved.

50:30.183 --> 50:32.309
Could be a good idea.

50:34.145 --> 50:36.480
- What's that?
- My watch.

50:36.647 --> 50:40.108
- It's on Moscow time.
- Time to pick up Pokey?

50:40.276 --> 50:42.487
- Time to feed parakeet.
- What's that?

50:42.654 --> 50:44.572
Russian for jerking off?

50:47.534 --> 50:50.203
- I guess not.
- What's wrong with parakeet?

50:50.370 --> 50:52.914
Nothing. I didn't say
anything was wrong with parakeet.

50:53.081 --> 50:54.916
My kid sister used to have a parakeet.

50:55.083 --> 50:57.835
You want a parakeet,
it's okay with me. I don't give a shit.

50:58.003 --> 51:00.421
You think that parakeet is feminine?

51:00.589 --> 51:03.841
Did I say that? I didn't say that, did I?

51:04.009 --> 51:06.677
What the hell do I know?
I guess it's okay.

51:06.845 --> 51:09.472
- Christ, it's fine.
- Thank you.

51:09.640 --> 51:11.098
You're welcome.

51:11.518 --> 51:13.352
Slow and fast.

51:13.520 --> 51:17.272
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, hips.

51:17.440 --> 51:20.192
One, two, three and four, five, six.

51:20.360 --> 51:23.153
Easy. One, two.

51:25.156 --> 51:28.992
One, two, smooth, five, six.

51:31.788 --> 51:34.498
Okay, that's great. That's fine.

51:41.382 --> 51:45.009
You mind showing me some ID?
I like to know who I'm talking to.

51:45.719 --> 51:47.470
Ridzik, Arthur, Detective Sergeant.

51:47.638 --> 51:49.722
This is Captain Danko.
He's from Moscow.

51:49.890 --> 51:52.225
Now, look,
you went to see Rosta in jail.

51:52.393 --> 51:55.562
- What did you talk about?
- The weather, taxes, inflation.

51:55.729 --> 51:57.856
So did you meet him
hanging around a hotel bar?

51:58.023 --> 51:59.691
You probably worked
the lobbies, right?

52:00.234 --> 52:01.484
Fuck you.

52:01.652 --> 52:03.903
No thank you, I have a headache
and good taste.

52:04.071 --> 52:06.197
I don't have to listen to this shit.

52:08.033 --> 52:12.245
It's very important.
Many people could be hurt.

52:15.499 --> 52:17.166
Shit.

52:17.334 --> 52:19.252
It's really no big deal.

52:19.420 --> 52:21.421
He told me to go to The Garvin,
get his old room...

52:21.589 --> 52:23.172
...told me exactly where to look.

52:23.340 --> 52:26.676
It was just a passport and this
hundred-dollar bill torn in half.

52:26.844 --> 52:30.471
I gave the stuff to a friend of Viktor's.
I don't even know his name.

52:30.639 --> 52:32.098
Cut the shit, will you?

52:32.266 --> 52:34.267
- Just tell me where he's at.
- I don't know.

52:34.435 --> 52:35.935
- Got a phone number?
- I lost it.

52:36.103 --> 52:39.982
- Look, this Viktor's a very bad guy.
- Really?

52:40.150 --> 52:42.943
- A cop died because of him.
- I don't know anything about it.

52:43.111 --> 52:44.987
You know anything
about 11th and State?

52:45.155 --> 52:47.740
Maybe I'll take you down there
and book you for murder.

52:47.908 --> 52:49.992
- Trying to scare me?
- Trying to figure out...

52:50.160 --> 52:53.537
...why you're trying to help him.
- He's my husband.

52:57.792 --> 53:01.420
I'm gonna bust that bitch so hard
she bounces.

53:01.630 --> 53:05.299
Wait. We can use her to find Viktor.

53:07.260 --> 53:11.139
You got all the ideas.
Maybe I'll just go home and whack off.

53:11.307 --> 53:13.600
You know, watch old crime stories,
get some tips.

53:14.810 --> 53:15.977
Viktor uses fake name...

53:16.145 --> 53:18.855
...marries American to get
travel visa to United States.

53:19.023 --> 53:22.817
Right. Why do I get the feeling
that you're taking it so personal?

53:22.985 --> 53:25.862
I shot his brother six months ago
in Moscow.

53:26.030 --> 53:27.697
- Shot him dead?
- Yes.

53:27.865 --> 53:28.907
Way to go.

53:29.075 --> 53:30.784
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

53:44.174 --> 53:47.635
Why don't we stake it out? You go
to the car, I'll get us something to eat.

53:47.803 --> 53:50.221
I'll get you something healthy,
from all food groups:

53:50.389 --> 53:52.515
Hamburger, French fries,
coffee and donuts.

53:52.683 --> 53:55.017
- Wait.
- What, you don't like onions?

53:55.185 --> 53:57.853
- Give me key to car.
- It's unlocked.

53:58.021 --> 53:59.772
In case she leave.

53:59.940 --> 54:02.191
You can't drive that car.
That's against regulations.

54:02.359 --> 54:03.359
What if you crash?

54:03.527 --> 54:06.862
That means I gotta fill out reports
until I retire.

54:07.030 --> 54:08.531
Key.

54:11.994 --> 54:15.454
All right. But honk
if you see something.

54:45.028 --> 54:47.988
Hey, asshole. You can't park here.

54:48.156 --> 54:50.365
This is my parking place.
I live right up there.

54:50.533 --> 54:53.410
Move your piece of shit car out now
or give me 50 bucks.

54:53.578 --> 54:56.913
- I do not understand.
- Let me make it real simple, moron.

54:57.081 --> 54:59.750
You move your ass or give me 50
or I take my Pete Rose...

54:59.917 --> 55:02.210
...and fucking mutilate your car.

55:02.670 --> 55:05.923
- Do you know Miranda?
- Never heard of the bitch.

55:29.740 --> 55:33.284
- Everything okay?
- Yes, fine. No problems.

55:33.453 --> 55:35.913
What about that sack of shit
laying on the sidewalk?

55:36.081 --> 55:37.915
He lives here.

55:40.168 --> 55:42.086
You're a real beaut, you know that?

55:42.629 --> 55:44.379
I called the squad room. Guess what.

55:44.547 --> 55:46.924
Tatomovich, you know,
that bastard I shot?

55:47.092 --> 55:49.968
Well, he's pulling out of his coma
at the hospital.

55:50.553 --> 55:53.639
Why don't we just go over there
and interrogate him, bag this shit?

55:53.807 --> 55:55.390
Here she is.

56:07.612 --> 56:09.446
- Now we go.
- Wait, wait, wait!

56:09.614 --> 56:13.659
Shit! Goddamn it! Jesus Christ!
I just burned off my dick!

56:13.827 --> 56:16.453
Oh, God! Jesus!

56:16.621 --> 56:19.456
Look at the mess I made, damn it.
Now I gotta wash the car.

56:19.624 --> 56:23.627
Just wrecked a goddamn suit
and I hard-boiled my nuts.

56:23.795 --> 56:26.839
It's gonna look like I pissed
in my pants all goddamn night.

56:27.006 --> 56:30.342
Hey, hey, careful with the driving,
will you? I don't want any accidents.

56:30.510 --> 56:33.179
I'll have to fill out paperwork
for the rest of my life.

56:33.347 --> 56:35.348
I have car under control.

56:35.558 --> 56:38.685
Yeah, sure. I suppose they taught you
everything you need to know...

56:38.853 --> 56:43.356
...about car wrecks and the price
of insurance in your school in Kiev.

56:43.899 --> 56:47.902
Socialist countries,
insurance not necessary.

56:48.070 --> 56:49.863
State pays for everything.

56:50.030 --> 56:52.782
Yeah.
Well, tell me something, captain.

56:52.950 --> 56:55.160
If you got such a fucking paradise
over there...

56:55.327 --> 56:58.163
...how come you're up the same creek
with heroin and cocaine?

56:58.330 --> 57:00.540
Chinese find way.

57:00.708 --> 57:02.710
Right after revolution...

57:02.878 --> 57:06.422
...they line up all drug dealers,
all drug addicts...

57:06.590 --> 57:10.301
...take them to public square
and shoot them in back of head.

57:10.802 --> 57:14.471
Never work here.
Fucking politicians wouldn't go for it.

57:14.639 --> 57:16.557
Shoot them first.

57:23.732 --> 57:25.399
Christ, they're right behind us.

57:26.193 --> 57:28.485
That's the general idea.

58:07.568 --> 58:10.779
Look at this, man. We have a pro
basketball team heading toward us...

58:10.947 --> 58:12.113
...with guns.

58:16.577 --> 58:17.953
- Hold this.
- What's this?

58:18.120 --> 58:20.121
It's Viktor's key.

58:22.250 --> 58:25.043
- Put gun away.
- Are you nuts?

58:42.854 --> 58:44.772
I'm supposed to tell you
that this is a truce...

58:44.940 --> 58:46.691
...arranged by somebody
named Abdul.

58:46.858 --> 58:49.735
- You leave your guns with those guys.
- No way.

58:49.903 --> 58:52.321
Chicago cop never relinquishes
his weapon.

58:53.865 --> 58:54.991
Here.

59:00.665 --> 59:02.291
You got the key?

59:03.042 --> 59:05.460
Boy, am I glad we hid that key.

59:05.628 --> 59:09.673
Good thing we didn't bring it with us.
We'd really be in deep shit.

59:12.677 --> 59:14.428
Don't waste your time.

59:15.596 --> 59:18.181
- Where is Viktor?
- We got everything under control.

59:18.349 --> 59:20.517
Well, good. I'll be the translator.

59:20.685 --> 59:23.854
You got a job. You're the hostage.

59:24.022 --> 59:26.524
I'm out of here. I've had enough
of this macho shit.

59:26.692 --> 59:28.484
Thank you. I'm glad you could help.

59:28.652 --> 59:31.362
Hey, I'm sorry,
but this whole thing is way past me.

59:31.530 --> 59:33.698
Honey, I understand, really.

59:36.869 --> 59:38.202
Go see Viktor.

59:38.370 --> 59:41.331
He's down that ramp over there.
You get out of hand...

59:42.624 --> 59:45.126
...your friend here gonna be gone.

59:45.544 --> 59:47.003
Hear that?

59:48.797 --> 59:50.048
Prick.

01:00:11.862 --> 01:00:18.493
Greetings, comrade.
We meet in strange places.

01:00:27.587 --> 01:00:29.088
I don't like being used as bait.

01:00:29.255 --> 01:00:32.925
- I thought Viktor wanted to see me.
- Viktor wants you to get in car.

01:00:44.145 --> 01:00:49.400
If they let me have my gun
you would be already dead.

01:00:50.110 --> 01:00:52.069
Cigarette?

01:00:59.036 --> 01:01:01.871
The people have many needs.

01:01:02.039 --> 01:01:07.585
One is law and order.
Other, entertainment.

01:01:08.963 --> 01:01:11.798
We both have our codes, Vanya.

01:01:11.966 --> 01:01:15.051
Yours, one of the state.

01:01:15.219 --> 01:01:18.930
Mine, one of thieves.

01:01:19.974 --> 01:01:23.018
We both respect courage.

01:01:23.186 --> 01:01:26.564
We even hold our own lives
in contempt.

01:01:27.065 --> 01:01:30.234
You have contempt for all life.

01:01:32.112 --> 01:01:33.654
You don't, huh?

01:01:33.822 --> 01:01:35.948
You killed my friend.

01:01:37.993 --> 01:01:40.244
You killed my brother.

01:01:40.412 --> 01:01:42.580
Your brother was criminal.

01:01:44.374 --> 01:01:47.001
A dead man is a dead man.

01:01:47.836 --> 01:01:51.630
After 70 years,
the doors begin to open in Moskva.

01:01:52.007 --> 01:01:55.801
Our first taste of freedom
will be cut with cocaine.

01:01:55.969 --> 01:01:57.845
Any country that can survive Stalin...

01:01:58.013 --> 01:02:01.098
...can certainly handle dope.

01:02:01.975 --> 01:02:05.019
I think you should come off
your high horse, captain...

01:02:05.187 --> 01:02:08.105
...and start to talk business.

01:02:08.773 --> 01:02:11.775
You have my key.

01:02:11.943 --> 01:02:14.528
I need it quite badly.

01:02:14.696 --> 01:02:16.489
I'm willing to pay for it generously.

01:02:16.656 --> 01:02:19.366
More than you can make in 10 years.

01:02:19.534 --> 01:02:22.204
I do not sell drugs.

01:02:26.667 --> 01:02:28.543
Foolish.

01:02:30.046 --> 01:02:33.757
You are so foolish.

01:02:37.845 --> 01:02:40.430
I thought you might
be more reasonable.

01:02:40.598 --> 01:02:44.684
Money has a way
of doing that to a man, but no.

01:02:44.852 --> 01:02:46.937
I don't think so.

01:02:47.104 --> 01:02:49.064
Not with you.

01:02:49.732 --> 01:02:54.612
You are one of those kinds of Soviets
that only look forward to death.

01:02:56.156 --> 01:02:58.991
I know you well, Vanya.

01:02:59.493 --> 01:03:04.914
Without me, you don't even exist.

01:03:19.556 --> 01:03:22.891
I don't give a shit if they did
give us the fucking guns back!

01:03:23.059 --> 01:03:26.186
These are the motherfuckers
that killed Gallagher, you know that?

01:03:26.354 --> 01:03:28.313
And you call yourself a fucking cop.

01:03:28.481 --> 01:03:32.025
You know, in this country,
we trust our partners.

01:03:32.193 --> 01:03:34.528
We don't hold back
from our partners...

01:03:34.696 --> 01:03:40.951
...and we never leave our partners
holding their dicks in their hands...

01:03:41.119 --> 01:03:44.913
...while some bald motherfucker's
got a gun in his ear.

01:03:45.915 --> 01:03:49.585
Here. Here. Take this goddamn key.
Take it.

01:03:49.752 --> 01:03:53.422
Now we go to hospital
to question Tatomovich.

01:03:53.590 --> 01:03:56.550
You are a shithead.

01:03:59.929 --> 01:04:03.265
- We're here to see Tatomovich.
- Yeah, I got him right over here.

01:04:03.433 --> 01:04:06.143
No, this is not part of our deal.
I've had...

01:04:45.643 --> 01:04:46.684
What is his condition?

01:04:46.853 --> 01:04:49.188
He started coming around
about an hour or so ago...

01:04:49.356 --> 01:04:51.315
...you know, mumbling something
in Russian.

01:04:51.483 --> 01:04:53.651
They got a nurse in there with him
right now.

01:04:55.278 --> 01:04:58.697
- Any visitors from downtown?
- Not so far, but they're on the way.

01:04:58.865 --> 01:05:00.783
You'd better wait
for Stobbs and Donnelly.

01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:04.203
- Ernie, let's get some coffee.
- Sure, okay.

01:05:07.791 --> 01:05:09.625
- Pardon me.
- Pardon me.

01:05:11.252 --> 01:05:14.797
Check it out.
I knew I should have been a doctor.

01:05:15.925 --> 01:05:19.052
Hey, this area's restrict...

01:05:20.596 --> 01:05:23.890
Hey, buddy. Hey, shithead.

01:05:24.558 --> 01:05:26.393
You talk to him.
You speak his language.

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:28.228
Tatomovich.

01:05:30.231 --> 01:05:32.899
Come on, scumbag, don't play dead.

01:05:40.241 --> 01:05:41.241
The nurse.

01:05:46.706 --> 01:05:48.248
Hey!

01:05:51.627 --> 01:05:52.669
Hey.

01:06:20.991 --> 01:06:22.450
Hey.

01:06:30.041 --> 01:06:32.293
Shit. Look out.

01:06:34.004 --> 01:06:37.548
Goddamn it, lady, police!
Stop, goddamn it, or I'll shoot.

01:06:37.716 --> 01:06:39.967
- Don't! Put it down.
- What are you doing here?

01:06:40.135 --> 01:06:42.595
- Put it down. Are you crazy?
- Move, goddamn it.

01:06:42.763 --> 01:06:44.556
- Put it down. Goddamn it.
- Goddamn it.

01:06:44.724 --> 01:06:45.891
- Move.
- Oh, God, no.

01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:51.813
Don't! Stop it!

01:06:53.649 --> 01:06:54.983
You...

01:07:45.369 --> 01:07:47.995
What the hell? It was a guy.

01:07:59.049 --> 01:08:00.758
Shit.

01:08:02.594 --> 01:08:05.012
You are stupid.

01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:06.973
I never meant for any of this...

01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:11.728
Viktor has 10 women like you at home.
They're all dead or in prison.

01:08:13.648 --> 01:08:15.816
What am I supposed to do?

01:08:23.408 --> 01:08:26.660
Go. Go.

01:08:34.711 --> 01:08:37.254
I just don't see how she could
disappear into thin air.

01:08:37.421 --> 01:08:39.924
- You checked the back stairs?
- Yes.

01:08:40.091 --> 01:08:42.218
- No sign of her?
- Yes.

01:08:42.386 --> 01:08:45.305
- She just got away?
- Yes.

01:08:46.807 --> 01:08:49.475
- Nice work, Gumby.
- Thank you.

01:08:49.643 --> 01:08:51.477
I didn't mean that.

01:08:52.104 --> 01:08:54.063
- You got a shithouse in Russia?
- Yes.

01:08:54.231 --> 01:08:56.774
We got one here
and you and I are standing right in it.

01:08:56.942 --> 01:09:00.278
It's not only gonna hit the fan,
it's gonna go right through the ceiling.

01:09:00.446 --> 01:09:03.781
Watch it, lady, okay? I don't know
why you insist on this tetanus shot.

01:09:03.948 --> 01:09:07.410
I had one 14 years ago. Easy.

01:09:08.578 --> 01:09:11.290
Shit, bitch.

01:09:12.542 --> 01:09:13.751
What's in that, cement?

01:09:15.545 --> 01:09:17.296
All right, what's the score, Ridzik?

01:09:18.631 --> 01:09:20.799
Shit, it's been a hell of a night,
commander.

01:09:20.966 --> 01:09:25.638
First of all, some cleanhead
stuck his damn gun in my ear.

01:09:25.805 --> 01:09:27.221
Danko here shot a drag queen.

01:09:27.390 --> 01:09:30.768
I've always enjoyed your reports,
Ridzik. I'm gonna enjoy the one...

01:09:30.935 --> 01:09:33.812
...where you detail your examination
of Gallagher's informant.

01:09:33.979 --> 01:09:35.648
- Streak?
- According to his lawyer...

01:09:35.814 --> 01:09:39.151
...you tried to break his hand.
He's filing a criminal and civil suit...

01:09:39.319 --> 01:09:40.486
...against the department.

01:09:40.654 --> 01:09:43.488
Well, it's bullshit.
We can beat that rap.

01:09:43.657 --> 01:09:46.200
He got his hand stuck in the door.
Danko will tell you.

01:09:46.368 --> 01:09:49.995
Listen, the story is after silencing
the alarm button on the EKG monitor...

01:09:50.162 --> 01:09:53.791
...el transvesto killed Tatomovich
by shooting an air bubble into a vein.

01:09:53.959 --> 01:09:55.793
He didn't want us to question him.

01:09:55.961 --> 01:09:58.337
Viktor did not want me
to question him.

01:09:58.505 --> 01:10:00.089
The drag queen belongs to Viktor?

01:10:00.256 --> 01:10:02.508
Yes. He killed his own man.

01:10:02.676 --> 01:10:05.469
He knew I would get information
from Tatomovich.

01:10:05.637 --> 01:10:08.473
- He thinks it's better to kill him.
- Did you get to his wife?

01:10:08.641 --> 01:10:12.435
This Manzetti woman? We've been
trying to track her down all night long.

01:10:15.439 --> 01:10:16.856
No, we don't have shit.

01:10:24.782 --> 01:10:27.701
Tell me, captain.
Where did you get the gun you used?

01:10:27.868 --> 01:10:31.413
Registered in my name.
Moscow Militia Headquarters.

01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:33.873
- Ridzik.
- Yeah.

01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:36.502
He did not know about gun.

01:10:37.129 --> 01:10:40.047
Under the circumstances, I'm gonna
have to ask for your weapon.

01:10:40.215 --> 01:10:41.716
And I say no.

01:10:41.883 --> 01:10:44.468
I see Ridzik is teaching you
his sense of humor.

01:10:44.636 --> 01:10:48.889
Your gun, captain. Now.
Don't fuck with me.

01:11:08.327 --> 01:11:09.369
Sergeant...

01:11:09.537 --> 01:11:13.206
...I need to see paperwork on this
whole incident by 10:00 this morning.

01:11:13.374 --> 01:11:15.375
Every move you and Danko
have made.

01:11:15.543 --> 01:11:17.169
You'll have it.

01:11:17.754 --> 01:11:21.173
- Where did you put the witnesses?
- Got them right down the hall, sir.

01:11:22.258 --> 01:11:24.051
I need other gun.

01:11:24.218 --> 01:11:27.429
Get away from me, man. Just get away
from me. I can't deal with that.

01:11:27.597 --> 01:11:30.098
We got no leads, pal.
We're batting fucking zero.

01:11:30.266 --> 01:11:33.518
Don't even look at me like that.
It's not happening.

01:11:33.686 --> 01:11:37.189
I mean, I give you a gun,
my ass is grass. You understand?

01:11:37.356 --> 01:11:40.692
Donnelly wants me for dog meat,
so forget it.

01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:43.236
Just get in the car and relax.

01:11:47.492 --> 01:11:52.037
We have many men like
Commander Donnelly in Soviet Union.

01:11:52.413 --> 01:11:56.917
I understand him. He's like KGB.

01:12:01.089 --> 01:12:02.631
All right, goddamn it.

01:12:05.803 --> 01:12:09.013
All right, I owe you one
because you saved my life tonight.

01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:11.766
Here.

01:12:12.226 --> 01:12:14.977
Captain Danko,
you are now the proud owner...

01:12:15.145 --> 01:12:17.730
...of the most powerful handgun
in the world.

01:12:18.607 --> 01:12:22.110
Soviet Podbyrin 9.2 mm...

01:12:22.277 --> 01:12:24.320
...is world's most powerful handgun.

01:12:24.488 --> 01:12:26.197
Come on, everyone knows
the Magnum.44...

01:12:26.365 --> 01:12:27.990
...is the big boy on the block.

01:12:28.158 --> 01:12:30.660
Why do you think Dirty Harry
uses it?

01:12:33.665 --> 01:12:35.916
Who is Dirty Harry?

01:12:41.172 --> 01:12:44.174
Well, you got your site report,
your preliminary report.

01:12:44.342 --> 01:12:46.009
You got your accident report.

01:12:46.177 --> 01:12:49.138
You got a questionnaire
from the coroner to fill out...

01:12:49.305 --> 01:12:51.181
...which has to be typed in triplicate.

01:12:51.349 --> 01:12:53.142
- How are you two fellows doing?
- Great.

01:12:53.309 --> 01:12:55.269
Just had my ass jammed
with a horse needle.

01:12:55.436 --> 01:12:57.146
Poor baby.

01:12:57.313 --> 01:13:01.108
Look, lady, I just got my coffee
the perfect color.

01:13:01.276 --> 01:13:04.070
It's the only thing I got going for me
tonight.

01:13:05.281 --> 01:13:06.906
You married?

01:13:08.576 --> 01:13:11.035
I'm just curious.
I mean, we are working together.

01:13:11.203 --> 01:13:14.038
- No.
- Ever?

01:13:14.206 --> 01:13:15.623
No.

01:13:16.041 --> 01:13:19.210
- You got a girlfriend?
- No.

01:13:19.545 --> 01:13:22.297
- Ever?
- Of course.

01:13:22.715 --> 01:13:25.049
Great. That's good to hear.

01:13:26.135 --> 01:13:28.553
How about your dad?
What was he, a cop?

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:34.976
Army. Dead 11 years.

01:13:36.687 --> 01:13:38.062
How about your ma?

01:13:38.230 --> 01:13:42.025
Nurse. Died when I was young.

01:13:42.359 --> 01:13:43.693
Grandparents?

01:13:43.861 --> 01:13:46.738
Killed in war against Nazis.

01:13:48.407 --> 01:13:50.366
Pretty fucking grim.

01:13:52.077 --> 01:13:55.079
- You got any brothers or sisters?
- No.

01:13:56.540 --> 01:13:57.624
You?

01:13:57.791 --> 01:14:00.085
Yeah, I got one sister. Divorced.

01:14:00.253 --> 01:14:02.296
Parents are both dead.

01:14:02.547 --> 01:14:06.342
My dad was a cop. A real good cop.

01:14:06.801 --> 01:14:10.429
You and I won't spend a lot of time
Christmas shopping this year, huh?

01:14:11.681 --> 01:14:14.016
You don't like talking
about this stuff, do you?

01:14:16.269 --> 01:14:18.062
I didn't think so.

01:14:19.022 --> 01:14:21.607
Yo, sweet cheeks.
While we're young, huh?

01:14:26.154 --> 01:14:27.738
Tea, please.

01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:31.409
In a glass with lemon.

01:14:32.119 --> 01:14:33.453
Right?

01:14:33.621 --> 01:14:35.038
Yes.

01:14:36.499 --> 01:14:38.792
I saw Dr. Zhivago.

01:14:55.601 --> 01:14:57.102
I'm gonna go back
to the station house.

01:14:57.270 --> 01:14:59.313
You catch a couple Z's
and take a shower.

01:14:59.481 --> 01:15:01.732
We'll get back to it
in a couple hours.

01:15:10.993 --> 01:15:12.576
Hey, you're all wet.

01:15:12.744 --> 01:15:14.412
Messages.

01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:17.665
Just trying to be friendly.

01:15:18.333 --> 01:15:20.293
Yeah, you got a whole
mess of them here.

01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:21.544
All from the same honey too.

01:15:21.712 --> 01:15:24.880
Been calling every 10 minutes
the last hour.

01:15:29.094 --> 01:15:32.096
Hey, buddy, I got an idea.
Why don't you just use my phone?

01:15:32.264 --> 01:15:34.015
Just make sure it's a local, will you?

01:15:39.021 --> 01:15:40.813
- Yeah.
- This is Danko.

01:15:40.981 --> 01:15:43.858
Yeah, look,
I can't be in the middle of this.

01:15:44.026 --> 01:15:46.944
If Viktor finds out, you guys
gotta promise you'll protect me.

01:15:47.112 --> 01:15:51.198
The drugs are coming in tonight.
I give you Viktor, you let me walk.

01:15:52.034 --> 01:15:54.910
- I do not understand.
- You know exactly what I mean.

01:15:55.078 --> 01:15:58.290
You get Viktor, I go free.
You understand "freedom"?

01:15:58.833 --> 01:16:02.377
Look, I just want my life back.
The city pays me $5.84 an hour...

01:16:02.545 --> 01:16:05.005
...to teach kids
they hope won't turn into junkies.

01:16:05.173 --> 01:16:08.425
Viktor gives me 10 grand
just to marry him. You figure it out.

01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:10.635
Look, he's gonna contact me.

01:16:10.803 --> 01:16:13.889
I find out when and where this
drug deal's going down. I tell you.

01:16:14.057 --> 01:16:17.809
- Why would he tell you?
- He trusts me. I'm his wife.

01:16:19.187 --> 01:16:22.064
Come on, Danko.
Don't just breathe at me.

01:16:23.441 --> 01:16:27.695
I get Viktor, I promise I do what I can
to help.

01:16:56.643 --> 01:16:59.478
- Come on, what's bugging you?
- What do you think?

01:16:59.646 --> 01:17:03.065
Check your messages, Art.
Your phone's been driving me crazy.

01:17:10.448 --> 01:17:12.282
Yeah, Ridzik, Nelligan here.

01:17:12.450 --> 01:17:15.494
Listen, that 560 report,
please get it done tonight.

01:17:15.662 --> 01:17:17.788
It's got to be in by morning.

01:17:17.956 --> 01:17:20.624
Yo, Art, this is Pat,
your millionaire brother-in-law.

01:17:20.792 --> 01:17:23.043
Yo, hey, pay attention to me.

01:17:23.211 --> 01:17:26.088
This alimony business
with your sister is getting out of hand.

01:17:26.256 --> 01:17:29.133
We gotta talk. I'll be at the key shop
later tonight.

01:18:24.733 --> 01:18:26.650
Hi, guys.

01:18:29.529 --> 01:18:31.071
How you doing?

01:18:32.866 --> 01:18:37.203
Hey, you want your old room back?

01:19:30.633 --> 01:19:32.342
We're ready for our next case.

01:19:32.510 --> 01:19:35.804
So, Mr. Bennet,
please introduce our new couple.

01:19:35.972 --> 01:19:38.932
Your Honor, this is the case
of Antonello v. Antonello.

01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:41.685
Ben Antonello is a 27-year-old
police officer.

01:19:41.852 --> 01:19:44.271
Roxanne Antonello is 23
and works at...

01:19:53.782 --> 01:19:55.491
Three-oh-two.

01:20:11.508 --> 01:20:15.886
- You shop full-time, then?
- As a matter of fact, I do.

01:20:21.853 --> 01:20:25.814
- Where is he?
- He's in the bathroom.

01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:46.501
Wrong guy.

01:20:47.295 --> 01:20:49.172
Viktor set us up.

01:21:06.357 --> 01:21:08.066
It's him.

01:22:05.583 --> 01:22:10.295
No. Not me. I'm not with them.
I don't know anything about this shit.

01:22:10.463 --> 01:22:12.631
- I just wanna get out of here.
- How many more?

01:22:12.799 --> 01:22:15.510
I don't know. They just came in
and blew my trick away.

01:22:16.303 --> 01:22:18.847
I don't know anything about this.

01:22:20.307 --> 01:22:22.058
Viktor.

01:22:23.811 --> 01:22:25.437
Hey, wait a minute.

01:22:33.446 --> 01:22:37.282
I don't believe this.
What is this all about?

01:22:40.619 --> 01:22:42.787
Hey, where are you going?

01:22:44.791 --> 01:22:47.460
You're not gonna start shooting again,
are you?

01:22:52.799 --> 01:22:54.592
What's in there?

01:23:00.098 --> 01:23:04.477
What are you gonna do?
Let's get out of here. Oh, God.

01:23:08.982 --> 01:23:10.983
Oh, God.

01:23:46.103 --> 01:23:47.479
Don't get any on your shoes.

01:23:47.980 --> 01:23:50.690
Would you tell me
who's gonna explain this to my boss?

01:23:50.858 --> 01:23:52.526
That third floor looks like Beirut.

01:23:52.693 --> 01:23:54.611
He's gonna shit bricks
when he sees this.

01:23:54.779 --> 01:23:57.697
Who's gonna back me up
when I tell him it's not my fault?

01:23:57.865 --> 01:23:59.991
The city of Chicago? You cops?

01:24:00.159 --> 01:24:01.868
Somebody's gotta pay for this...

01:24:02.036 --> 01:24:05.372
...and it ain't gonna be
that bastard Commie Russian.

01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:08.083
- I'm just here to get your statement.
- I don't know.

01:24:08.251 --> 01:24:10.168
I don't know about anything.

01:24:10.336 --> 01:24:13.548
- Everybody just started shooting.
- Where'd you get the gun?

01:24:13.715 --> 01:24:15.550
In my purse.

01:24:15.717 --> 01:24:18.469
I don't know nothing about any of this.

01:24:18.637 --> 01:24:22.682
- You carry a gun in your purse?
- Around here everybody's got a gun.

01:24:22.850 --> 01:24:24.725
You meet a lot of weirdos.

01:24:27.396 --> 01:24:30.231
- How many more upstairs?
- Three.

01:24:30.399 --> 01:24:33.693
There's only one thing that's clear
to me about this whole damn case.

01:24:33.861 --> 01:24:36.070
That Russian bastard
is still holding out on us.

01:24:36.238 --> 01:24:40.575
- Young woman found in the Chicago
River as a Catherine "Cat" Manzetti.

01:24:40.742 --> 01:24:42.536
The victim was a dance instructor...

01:24:42.704 --> 01:24:45.747
...employed at Wicker Park
Performing Arts Center.

01:24:45.915 --> 01:24:47.583
She was 24 years old.

01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:49.918
The body was discovered
beneath the Kinsey Bridge...

01:24:50.086 --> 01:24:51.795
...by a local patrol unit.

01:24:51.963 --> 01:24:53.589
Cause of death
has not been determined...

01:24:53.756 --> 01:24:56.133
...but foul play
has not been ruled out.

01:24:56.301 --> 01:25:00.095
Thus far, investigators are refusing
to comment on the incident.

01:25:00.263 --> 01:25:02.890
Miss Manzetti was identified
by police records.

01:25:03.057 --> 01:25:05.976
In 1986,
she was charged with pros...

01:25:09.188 --> 01:25:10.230
It's Viktor's wife.

01:25:11.399 --> 01:25:14.610
Cat Manzetti. We fished her
out of the river about an hour ago.

01:25:14.777 --> 01:25:17.571
Preliminary med-path
indicates a broken neck...

01:25:17.739 --> 01:25:20.073
...strangulation, the works.

01:25:21.451 --> 01:25:23.785
I want an autopsy right away.

01:25:27.290 --> 01:25:30.292
If I talk to either of them now,
I'm gonna get a heart attack.

01:25:30.460 --> 01:25:33.045
Bring them both in,
shut them down, the end.

01:25:33.212 --> 01:25:36.798
I'll interview Danko in my office later.
I want some debriefing.

01:25:36.966 --> 01:25:40.219
I was very wrong about the downside.

01:25:46.352 --> 01:25:49.562
Donnelly says you're riding
the desk starting now.

01:25:49.730 --> 01:25:53.316
We're sending you back
behind the curtain where you belong.

01:25:56.487 --> 01:25:57.487
Eat shit.

01:25:58.238 --> 01:25:59.906
Excuse me?

01:26:00.908 --> 01:26:03.034
See you at the office.

01:26:11.002 --> 01:26:14.088
Stupid, goddamn, fucking Russians!

01:26:15.006 --> 01:26:18.008
Don't take that personal, Danko.
I didn't mean you.

01:26:18.176 --> 01:26:19.885
I'm talking about Viktor.

01:26:20.053 --> 01:26:22.680
Except Viktor's not stupid
because he's got the key.

01:26:31.189 --> 01:26:34.233
Okay, Art, if you and your foreign
friend wanna goosestep back here...

01:26:34.401 --> 01:26:35.442
...we can talk.

01:26:35.610 --> 01:26:36.735
- These the books?
- Yeah.

01:26:36.903 --> 01:26:39.864
They're alphabetical order
and in English. Is that a problem?

01:26:40.032 --> 01:26:42.617
- Hey, take a walk, will you?
- What did you do, Art?

01:26:42.785 --> 01:26:45.412
Lock one of your girlfriends up
in the patrol car?

01:26:47.373 --> 01:26:50.417
- Tell your sister to stop calling me.
- I'll give you a tip.

01:26:50.584 --> 01:26:53.003
Pay your alimony on time
and she'll leave you alone.

01:26:53.170 --> 01:26:55.088
Said it was your idea
to go back to court.

01:26:55.256 --> 01:26:58.383
She can take me back to court
because I don't have any more money.

01:26:58.551 --> 01:27:01.052
We both agreed to the payments.
Why can't she live...

01:27:01.220 --> 01:27:04.681
Your May check arrived July 9th
and bounced like a superball.

01:27:04.849 --> 01:27:08.560
- Too much free work for the police.
- Maybe we should have a pity party.

01:27:08.728 --> 01:27:11.354
Don't start with that. Talk to her.
She'll listen to you.

01:27:11.522 --> 01:27:13.732
She don't listen.
I told her not to marry you.

01:27:13.899 --> 01:27:15.650
I offered her money not to marry you.

01:27:15.818 --> 01:27:17.736
I gave her the best six months
of my life.

01:27:17.903 --> 01:27:20.238
You know what you are?
You're cheap, man.

01:27:20.406 --> 01:27:23.033
You hurt her. You owe her money,
and you should pay up.

01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:27.078
- You're a sleazebag.
- Get out of my face.

01:27:27.496 --> 01:27:29.748
Hey, you pay her.

01:27:38.550 --> 01:27:40.092
Find anything?

01:27:57.110 --> 01:27:58.694
Coffee.

01:28:14.587 --> 01:28:16.129
Thank you.

01:28:36.985 --> 01:28:40.571
Everything okay, yes?

01:28:42.783 --> 01:28:44.325
Sure.

01:28:44.827 --> 01:28:48.454
The stuff's coming in on the 9:30
from El Paso. Check it out.

01:28:50.332 --> 01:28:51.833
I trust you.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.335
Spread it all over Siberia, right, man?

01:29:13.397 --> 01:29:15.648
All right. Let's go in.

01:29:15.816 --> 01:29:18.151
Wait a minute. Now, look.

01:29:18.610 --> 01:29:21.821
I know you really want this guy,
but this is a Chicago Police matter.

01:29:21.989 --> 01:29:24.490
Go in the front.
I'm gonna cover the back.

01:29:24.658 --> 01:29:26.534
And don't try to be a hero.

01:29:26.702 --> 01:29:28.161
You dig?

01:29:29.705 --> 01:29:32.249
You dig? You understand? Dig?

01:29:32.417 --> 01:29:34.209
What, they didn't
teach you that in Kiev?

01:29:34.377 --> 01:29:37.379
- I'm not on holiday here.
- Then let's go.

01:29:59.569 --> 01:30:00.736
Excuse me.

01:30:02.114 --> 01:30:04.866
You got change for a $100 bill?

01:30:09.079 --> 01:30:11.414
This is the smallest I have.

01:30:19.423 --> 01:30:22.467
Your merchandise
is in the luggage trunks.

01:30:49.454 --> 01:30:50.829
Hey.

01:30:59.047 --> 01:31:00.881
You did not make it, Viktor.

01:31:02.133 --> 01:31:03.592
Back off, captain.

01:31:04.469 --> 01:31:07.721
He killed a Chicago police officer.
Chicago gets him first.

01:31:07.889 --> 01:31:09.807
I have my orders.

01:31:09.975 --> 01:31:11.642
What, are you fucking nuts?

01:31:13.144 --> 01:31:15.771
All right, come on, get real, Danko.

01:31:15.939 --> 01:31:18.274
Look, we're doing good things here.
We'll... Move!

01:31:19.484 --> 01:31:20.901
Move!

01:32:02.362 --> 01:32:04.780
- I'm not leaving yet, mister.
- Get out.

01:32:07.034 --> 01:32:08.576
Hey.

01:32:09.494 --> 01:32:11.912
Hey. Hey.

01:32:15.792 --> 01:32:17.251
- Get in.
- What were you gonna do?

01:32:17.419 --> 01:32:19.003
Leave without me?

01:32:24.885 --> 01:32:27.054
Where did you learn to drive a bus,
anyway?

01:32:27.221 --> 01:32:29.473
Kiev. In the army.

01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:31.725
Jesus, we're going down
the wrong way street.

01:32:31.893 --> 01:32:33.977
Get on the other side of the street.

01:32:35.063 --> 01:32:38.899
Danko. Danko,
you're not listening to me.

01:32:40.068 --> 01:32:43.070
Christ. Go to the right.

01:32:49.577 --> 01:32:52.913
Way to go.
That was a fucking Chicago landmark.

01:33:14.769 --> 01:33:16.478
Where the hell are all the cops?

01:33:16.646 --> 01:33:19.189
Damn, they're never around
when you need one, you know?

01:33:19.357 --> 01:33:23.443
You make a U-turn, they're all over
your ass. Where the fuck are they?

01:33:37.709 --> 01:33:38.876
Watch it, watch it!

01:33:52.641 --> 01:33:53.766
Shit!

01:34:47.865 --> 01:34:50.450
Shit. This is called Chicken.

01:34:50.618 --> 01:34:52.368
You're not supposed
to play it with buses.

01:34:52.536 --> 01:34:55.163
- This is no game.
- No shit.

01:34:58.709 --> 01:35:00.001
Get ready to swerve.

01:35:01.879 --> 01:35:03.379
Come on, get ready to swerve.

01:35:07.718 --> 01:35:10.845
Come on. You crazy fucker.

01:35:53.808 --> 01:35:56.268
You fucker. You almost killed
both of us, goddamn it.

01:35:56.435 --> 01:35:59.020
- And Viktor!
- Fuck Viktor!

01:35:59.188 --> 01:36:01.856
What's wrong with you?
Are you crazy?

01:36:02.024 --> 01:36:03.733
You almost got us both killed!

01:36:03.901 --> 01:36:07.904
Jesus Christ, man! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

01:36:08.990 --> 01:36:11.366
You son of a bitch.

01:36:18.958 --> 01:36:21.377
I take care of this.

01:36:28.385 --> 01:36:30.636
I give up.
This whole thing's very Russia.

01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:35.433
Hey, Gumby.

01:36:35.726 --> 01:36:37.768
Honk if you need me.

01:37:24.317 --> 01:37:26.026
Did you get him?

01:37:29.197 --> 01:37:31.865
Nice grouping of your shots.

01:37:32.367 --> 01:37:34.409
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:37:34.577 --> 01:37:37.746
I still like Soviet model better.

01:37:41.376 --> 01:37:43.835
Got a real attitude problem, Danko.

01:38:20.250 --> 01:38:22.501
High, left center.

01:38:24.003 --> 01:38:26.338
I do not understand this sport.

01:38:26.506 --> 01:38:28.924
You're not supposed to.
It's totally American.

01:38:29.092 --> 01:38:31.593
You should stick to things
that you're good at.

01:38:31.761 --> 01:38:36.765
You know, like knee dancing, training
those cute little bears for the circus.

01:38:37.517 --> 01:38:39.768
We play baseball now
in Soviet Union.

01:38:39.936 --> 01:38:41.395
Come on.

01:38:41.563 --> 01:38:44.690
Give me a break, will you?
You haven't got a shot.

01:38:44.858 --> 01:38:47.443
This is our national pastime.

01:38:47.610 --> 01:38:49.194
Forget it.

01:38:51.406 --> 01:38:53.907
It'd be a hell of a World Series,
though, wouldn't it?

01:38:54.909 --> 01:38:56.285
We will win.

01:39:00.665 --> 01:39:04.209
Hey, Danko, listen, I been wanting
to ask you something.

01:39:04.377 --> 01:39:07.963
Remember when we were back at
the bus station, both of us had Viktor?

01:39:08.131 --> 01:39:10.799
You turned and pointed
the gun at me.

01:39:11.468 --> 01:39:13.635
You weren't gonna really shoot me,
were you?

01:39:18.809 --> 01:39:20.977
Yeah, that's what I figured.

01:39:21.812 --> 01:39:23.521
Just checking.

01:39:30.571 --> 01:39:32.655
It is custom in Soviet Union...

01:39:32.823 --> 01:39:37.494
...to exchange article
as souvenir for friendship.

01:39:38.204 --> 01:39:40.955
I decide to give you this.

01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:44.460
That's really nice.

01:39:44.836 --> 01:39:47.421
Here. Here, I want you
to have my watch.

01:39:47.714 --> 01:39:52.551
This here is a $1000 marvel
of Western technology.

01:39:52.719 --> 01:39:55.596
I got it at, you know, a discount
from my cousin.

01:39:58.433 --> 01:39:59.642
Thanks.

01:39:59.810 --> 01:40:01.519
This is really...

01:40:02.687 --> 01:40:05.689
...a $20 East German watch.

01:40:09.694 --> 01:40:11.237
Thank you.

01:40:13.741 --> 01:40:15.242
Ridzik.

01:40:17.286 --> 01:40:19.538
We are police officers...

01:40:20.289 --> 01:40:21.832
...not politicians.

01:40:22.333 --> 01:40:24.835
It's okay to like each other.

01:40:34.428 --> 01:40:37.138
Sorry, my Russian's a little rusty.

01:40:38.933 --> 01:40:40.517
Good luck.

01:40:41.769 --> 01:40:43.520
Farewell.
