WEBVTT

00:01.504 --> 00:02.753
We hear you've been on ditching school.

00:02.839 --> 00:05.589
I wanna drop out. I got a job at that bar.

00:05.675 --> 00:08.092
- Come to California with me.
- You're on your own path.

00:08.144 --> 00:09.343
I think what you really need

00:09.429 --> 00:10.728
is to do this on your own.

00:10.763 --> 00:12.596
- They wanna book the tour.
- I'll call you every night.

00:12.648 --> 00:15.266
(Elizabeth) I'll answer every night.

00:15.318 --> 00:17.768
(Carter) I have been
hanging out at Jared's.

00:17.820 --> 00:19.937
- He's way too old for you.
- You're 17?

00:20.022 --> 00:22.940
Did you know he's married?

00:23.025 --> 00:24.492
- Seriously?
- You think I enjoy

00:24.577 --> 00:25.659
rifling through your underwear drawer

00:25.745 --> 00:27.278
looking for the money that you owe me?

00:27.363 --> 00:29.113
I'm gonna have some
stuff for you to do soon.

00:29.198 --> 00:30.364
I want you to leave.

00:30.450 --> 00:31.665
You can't sell drugs at my party.

00:31.751 --> 00:33.451
Carter, something's wrong with Seth!

00:33.503 --> 00:34.952
Come on, hey. Hey!

00:35.037 --> 00:36.954
No, no, no. He's dead.

00:37.006 --> 00:38.038
We got into this together.

00:38.124 --> 00:39.423
We'll get out of it together too.

00:39.459 --> 00:41.258
Your friend says he knew
drugs were being sold.

00:41.294 --> 00:42.626
I don't believe you.

00:42.712 --> 00:43.844
Carter's in trouble.

00:43.930 --> 00:44.962
My dad's getting out.

00:45.047 --> 00:46.680
Hey, son.

00:46.766 --> 00:48.966
No! No!

00:49.018 --> 00:50.634
You should think about moving near me.

00:50.686 --> 00:52.436
You're kinda the greatest son ever.

00:52.472 --> 00:54.271
You know I would do the same thing for you.

00:54.307 --> 00:55.773
- Bird?
- I'm pregnant.

00:55.808 --> 00:57.641
Okay, we're gonna figure this out.

00:57.727 --> 00:59.143
Carter's in a lot of trouble

00:59.228 --> 01:01.312
and she's gonna need
all the help she can get.

01:01.364 --> 01:02.530
Hey! Lori!

01:02.615 --> 01:04.482
Give me one reason not to kill you.

01:04.534 --> 01:05.983
She didn't know anything about the drugs.

01:06.035 --> 01:07.318
<i>- I admit it.
- That's it.</i>

01:08.788 --> 01:11.739
I'm sorry, I thought I
had it all under control.

01:11.824 --> 01:14.158
I will always be there for you.

01:14.243 --> 01:15.543

01:35.681 --> 01:38.349
- Carter.
- Hey.

01:38.401 --> 01:40.518
What the hell are you doing here?

01:40.570 --> 01:42.236
My lawyer got me out on bail.

01:42.321 --> 01:44.355
Can I talk to you for a minute?

01:44.407 --> 01:46.156
I don't think we have
anything to talk about.

01:46.192 --> 01:47.441
- Carter, please...
- What are you doing?

01:47.527 --> 01:48.993
There's a few things
I just need to explain.

01:49.028 --> 01:50.578
Yeah, I'll bet, like why you threw me

01:50.663 --> 01:52.112
under the bus with the cops.

01:52.198 --> 01:53.998
I didn't... I mean,
yeah, I did, but I knew

01:54.033 --> 01:55.249
you'd get off, okay? You're underage.

01:55.334 --> 01:58.369
Really? That's your explanation?

02:00.122 --> 02:03.207
Wow, thank you, that's very noble of you.

02:03.292 --> 02:04.542
I have no excuse, okay?

02:04.627 --> 02:06.510
Except I have my little girl to support.

02:06.546 --> 02:07.678
I can't go to jail.

02:07.713 --> 02:09.797
And to hell with everyone else, right?

02:09.882 --> 02:11.215
No, no, it's not what I'm saying.

02:11.267 --> 02:14.184
I was in way over my head,
things got out of control.

02:14.220 --> 02:15.386
- Oh, my God.
- Please, Carter,

02:15.471 --> 02:16.770
you gotta listen to me, okay?

02:16.856 --> 02:18.389
I'm not asking you to forgive me.

02:18.441 --> 02:20.107
But after everything
that went down between us,

02:20.192 --> 02:21.525
can't you just hear me out?

02:21.561 --> 02:24.228
Fine. Explain.

02:24.280 --> 02:26.146
I was in the hole before I met you,

02:26.232 --> 02:27.698
I was about to lose the bar.

02:27.733 --> 02:29.233
- Yep, you told me that.
- What you don't know

02:29.285 --> 02:30.985
is that I borrowed money from some guys

02:31.070 --> 02:32.319
to help dig myself out.

02:32.405 --> 02:34.038
They seemed okay, I thought I was on my way

02:34.073 --> 02:35.122
to paying them off because the money

02:35.207 --> 02:36.373
we were making from the parties.

02:36.409 --> 02:37.741
But then they started charging me more,

02:37.793 --> 02:39.960
twisting my arm and forcing me to do stuff.

02:40.046 --> 02:41.829
So, you started dealing for them,

02:41.914 --> 02:44.131
and you made Ben do it too.

02:44.216 --> 02:45.833
Look, I know I should've stood up to them,

02:45.918 --> 02:47.217
but they threatened me.

02:47.253 --> 02:49.470
They said they were
gonna hurt my little girl.

02:49.555 --> 02:51.922
I just want you to know
that if I could go back,

02:52.008 --> 02:53.424
I would do it all differently.

02:55.061 --> 02:56.427
I still love you, Carter.

02:56.479 --> 02:58.512
I need you to know that.

02:58.598 --> 03:00.481
And if there's any way
you could just give me

03:00.566 --> 03:02.266
another chance.

03:05.021 --> 03:06.437
I gotta go, Jared.

I just don't understand

03:38.104 --> 03:39.136
how he could put up some money

03:39.188 --> 03:41.355
and walk away freely like that.

03:41.440 --> 03:42.773
Well, charges may be pending,

03:42.808 --> 03:44.692
it's difficult to know
exactly what went on.

03:44.777 --> 03:47.811
I'm not part of the investigation anymore.

03:49.448 --> 03:51.815
I could find out, if you want.

03:51.867 --> 03:53.450
- Would you?
- Listen.

03:53.486 --> 03:55.786
I'm not sure hearing all the details

03:55.821 --> 03:57.905
is gonna make you feel any better.

03:57.990 --> 03:59.456
Well, I don't know either,

03:59.492 --> 04:01.325
but I think I still wanna hear them.

04:03.295 --> 04:05.996
All right then.

04:06.048 --> 04:08.549
Thank you...

04:08.634 --> 04:11.635
for not saying "I told you so."

04:11.671 --> 04:13.303
Well, my mother said it enough to me

04:13.339 --> 04:14.588
to last a lifetime, so...

04:14.674 --> 04:16.173
I'm trying to break the cycle.

04:16.225 --> 04:18.142
(chuckles)

04:18.177 --> 04:22.012
You know, Carter, there's
not a person in the world

04:22.098 --> 04:24.231
who hasn't made a mistake.

04:24.316 --> 04:27.151
You just got swept up, that's all.

04:27.186 --> 04:29.403
It's human.

04:32.191 --> 04:35.159
How 'bout we just focus on the future?

04:35.194 --> 04:38.362
You got your whole life ahead of you.

04:40.533 --> 04:43.250
(rock music playing)

04:47.339 --> 04:48.922
(sneezes)

04:57.016 --> 05:01.051
This place looks amazing.
Your mom is gonna love it.

05:01.137 --> 05:02.886
Thank you for helping me.

05:02.938 --> 05:05.556
Of course, you know how
much I hate a dust bunny.

05:05.641 --> 05:07.691
Mmm.

05:07.727 --> 05:09.476
I feel bad for leaving her behind

05:09.562 --> 05:11.562
after my dad got arrested.

05:11.614 --> 05:14.031
She's kinda been spiraling.

05:14.066 --> 05:16.817
She quit her job, and now
she's way behind on bills.

05:16.902 --> 05:19.870
Well, you're a really good son and friend.

05:19.905 --> 05:22.456
Thank you for offering
to help me with Bird.

05:22.541 --> 05:24.408
Has Bird decided what she's gonna do yet?

05:24.460 --> 05:27.077
No, she's still processing.

05:27.163 --> 05:29.413
That can't be easy.

05:32.468 --> 05:35.052
What would we do if I got pregnant?

05:35.087 --> 05:38.806
My mom was 18 when she had me.

05:38.891 --> 05:41.008
- I don't think she was ready.
- Yeah, I get that.

05:41.093 --> 05:43.644
She never had time to
figure out what she wanted.

05:43.729 --> 05:45.596
Well, she's crazy about you.

05:45.648 --> 05:47.314
Yeah.

05:47.399 --> 05:49.767
I think she gave up a lot to have me.

05:51.353 --> 05:53.687
I would be there with you either way.

05:55.024 --> 05:56.774
I know you would.

06:01.163 --> 06:04.414
It should have been something
Seth and I decided together.

06:04.450 --> 06:08.585
Well, I wish he was still here too.

06:08.621 --> 06:11.088
My life before was so easy.

06:11.123 --> 06:14.208
What do I wear? What purse do I buy?

06:14.293 --> 06:16.460
Which wine to match with which cheese.

06:16.512 --> 06:21.348
If I do it, I won't have
anything left with him.

06:21.433 --> 06:25.469
If I don't do it, I'll have a baby.

06:25.521 --> 06:28.605
Me, Bird, with a child,

06:28.641 --> 06:30.691
probably living at my parents' house,

06:30.776 --> 06:32.192
if they don't kick me out first.

06:32.278 --> 06:34.978
Oh, come on, your parents
aren't gonna kick you out.

06:35.064 --> 06:36.980
Okay, fine, they might.

06:37.066 --> 06:38.482
Look, whatever you decide,

06:38.534 --> 06:40.784
we're gonna be 100% behind you, okay?

06:40.820 --> 06:41.819
Thanks.

06:41.871 --> 06:43.821
You make the appointment at the clinic?

06:43.873 --> 06:45.322
(sighing) Yeah.

06:45.374 --> 06:47.491
But I can always cancel
it, I mean, I can...

06:47.576 --> 06:49.076
always just not go.

06:49.161 --> 06:50.577
Exactly.

06:50.663 --> 06:52.212
It's completely your call.

06:52.298 --> 06:54.832
God, I wish it wasn't though.

07:00.256 --> 07:02.506
(Elizabeth) All right, thanks.

07:02.558 --> 07:04.341
Jared's out on bail, and it looks like

07:04.426 --> 07:06.009
- his lawyer made a deal.
- What are the terms?

07:06.061 --> 07:08.929
The terms are he'll be off
completely if he puts together

07:09.014 --> 07:10.681
a list of everyone involved in the dealing.

07:10.766 --> 07:12.182
So, basically he's gonna
rat his way out of it.

07:12.268 --> 07:13.567
- (Elizabeth) Sounds that way.
- Hey, we don't know

07:13.652 --> 07:15.068
for sure he's gonna give you up.

07:15.154 --> 07:17.354
We don't? I mean, what's stopping him?

07:17.439 --> 07:19.323
They only care about the big fish, right?

07:19.358 --> 07:21.825
They're not gonna waste
their time on an underage kid.

07:21.861 --> 07:24.027
Kids die, they want everyone.
They're sending a message.

07:24.113 --> 07:26.864
But Ben was forced into it,
he can't be held responsible.

07:26.916 --> 07:29.283
Details don't matter,
they're making an example

07:29.368 --> 07:31.001
out of everyone who was involved.

07:31.036 --> 07:32.252
So, I'm screwed.

07:32.338 --> 07:34.037
(door opens)

07:42.181 --> 07:44.431
Hello.

07:46.024 --> 07:47.601
Somebody wanna tell me what's going on?

07:47.701 --> 07:48.700
Um... hey!

07:48.786 --> 07:49.701
Hey.

07:49.787 --> 07:50.786
Dad, welcome home.

07:50.871 --> 07:52.287
Hey you.

07:52.373 --> 07:54.456
I... I wasn't expecting
you home until the weekend.

07:54.541 --> 07:56.625
Well, after your call, I thought I better

07:56.710 --> 07:58.176
cut the tour short.

07:58.262 --> 08:00.429
Hey, Ben. Good to see you.

08:00.464 --> 08:02.464
Yeah, you too.

08:04.968 --> 08:08.887
(chuckles) I bet this
seems a little strange.

08:08.972 --> 08:11.139
That would be an understatement.

08:11.191 --> 08:13.558
- Dad!
- Aw, there he is.

08:13.644 --> 08:15.644
Hey.

08:17.031 --> 08:18.814
(clears throat)

08:18.866 --> 08:21.783
- This is the new normal.
- Really?

08:21.819 --> 08:23.869
Yeah, I think we better get going.

08:23.954 --> 08:26.655
Um, you'll keep us posted?

08:26.707 --> 08:29.458
About what?

08:29.493 --> 08:31.043
Liz?

08:33.746 --> 08:36.331
Anybody gonna fill me in?

08:37.467 --> 08:41.837
I'm loving your place,
it's so... tidy, funky.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.472
You can take the bed.

08:43.506 --> 08:45.674
That's very sweet of you, honey.

08:45.726 --> 08:47.008
Thank you.

08:48.762 --> 08:51.847
Okay, these are all of your bills

08:51.932 --> 08:54.266
in order of payment due.

08:54.351 --> 08:56.017
Here's some cash I scrounged up for you.

08:56.070 --> 08:59.271
(gasps) Thank you, honey!

08:59.356 --> 09:02.991
I love how you put them
in order of date due.

09:03.026 --> 09:04.860
You are so organized!

09:04.945 --> 09:06.528
Taylor helped me.

09:06.580 --> 09:08.830
One of these days, I'm gonna
get a little system of me own.

09:08.866 --> 09:11.166
Until then, you have me.

09:11.201 --> 09:12.951
All you need to do is go
out and get money orders,

09:13.036 --> 09:15.454
and then you can send these off today.

09:15.539 --> 09:17.839
Aw.

09:17.875 --> 09:20.258
Mmm.

09:20.344 --> 09:23.879
How 'bout I make you
dinner as a thank you, hmm?

09:23.964 --> 09:25.797
Okay.

09:25.883 --> 09:27.215
Really?

09:27.267 --> 09:30.469
All you have is mac and cheese and popcorn?

09:30.554 --> 09:34.055
We have olives and brownie mix.

09:34.141 --> 09:36.475
No offense, but I'm not
eating your brownies.

09:41.565 --> 09:43.281
Carter, hey.

09:43.367 --> 09:46.067
Please don't put Ben's
name on that list, Jared.

09:46.153 --> 09:48.203
Whoa... what are you talking about?

09:48.238 --> 09:49.738
I know you made a deal with the DA

09:49.823 --> 09:51.740
and I know that would involve
putting Ben on that list.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.291
Stop. I'm not giving up Ben.

09:53.377 --> 09:55.744
Jared, I know you agreed to the deal.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.129
Yeah, I did.

09:57.214 --> 09:58.797
But Ben isn't part of it.

09:58.882 --> 10:00.749
He's not?

10:00.834 --> 10:02.217
No.

10:02.252 --> 10:03.835
I would do pretty much anything

10:03.921 --> 10:05.337
to get partial custody of my daughter,

10:05.422 --> 10:07.589
but I know how much Ben means to you.

10:07.674 --> 10:08.890
Are you lying to me?

10:08.926 --> 10:11.226
No.

10:11.261 --> 10:14.179
Carter, I would never
do anything to hurt you.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.766
I love you.

10:17.818 --> 10:20.268
You know that, right?

10:21.271 --> 10:23.438
I thought I did, yeah.

10:23.524 --> 10:24.773
(sighs)

10:24.858 --> 10:27.359
Look, I know everything's
been crazy and there's been

10:27.444 --> 10:29.361
rumors flying around, but you have my word.

10:29.446 --> 10:32.113
I want you to stop
worrying about Ben, okay?

10:32.166 --> 10:34.449
He's gonna be fine.

10:34.535 --> 10:37.035
I promise.

10:39.790 --> 10:41.423
Thank you.

10:41.458 --> 10:42.958
First, Carter's brought in for questioning,

10:43.043 --> 10:44.292
and now, Ben's involved?

10:44.378 --> 10:46.127
Carter was part of a
preliminary investigation

10:46.213 --> 10:47.679
after this kid's death.

10:47.764 --> 10:50.966
Now, Ben's involvement may be more serious.

10:51.018 --> 10:52.801
I don't understand any of this.

10:52.886 --> 10:54.352
Well, I'm trying to
explain it to you, David.

10:54.438 --> 10:56.137
How could you not tell me

10:56.223 --> 10:57.639
Carter was living with this guy?

10:57.691 --> 10:59.391
I told you that Carter moved out.

10:59.476 --> 11:02.310
Now, you were on a book tour.

11:02.396 --> 11:04.613
I felt like that was your priority.

11:04.648 --> 11:06.815
I was trying to take care of this family.

11:06.900 --> 11:10.151
And I was trying to take
care of everything here

11:10.237 --> 11:11.486
on my own!

11:11.538 --> 11:13.321
Now, I don't appreciate you coming in here

11:13.407 --> 11:15.457
and second guessing my decision making.

11:15.492 --> 11:17.042
Well, considering what's happened,

11:17.127 --> 11:18.827
I guess I can understand that.

11:18.879 --> 11:21.746
This conversation is over.

11:27.387 --> 11:30.005
Wait, so I have to get
my parents' permission?

11:30.090 --> 11:32.007
Yep, you have to wait 24 hours

11:32.059 --> 11:34.392
and have an ultrasound.

11:36.563 --> 11:40.232
We could go to D.C. It's only an hour away.

11:40.317 --> 11:41.433
We wouldn't have to jump through hoops.

11:41.518 --> 11:42.767
Maybe this is a sign.

11:42.853 --> 11:44.686
Maybe Seth wouldn't want me to do this.

11:44.738 --> 11:46.354
It's just a law.

11:46.406 --> 11:48.523
I'm not sure it has
anything to do with Seth.

11:51.662 --> 11:53.361
You know, I've been thinking.

11:53.413 --> 11:56.364
You can have the baby, and we get married.

11:56.416 --> 12:00.085
Wow, that's really generous, Gabe.

12:00.170 --> 12:02.003
Yeah, that is very sweet.

12:02.039 --> 12:04.289
(clears throat) A little help here, man?

12:04.374 --> 12:06.458
Tell her I'm the marrying
type. I'd make a great husband,

12:06.543 --> 12:08.543
I've got really great hair. Something?

12:08.629 --> 12:10.845
You know, Bird, I've
been thinking about Gabe.

12:10.881 --> 12:12.597
He really is the marrying type.

12:12.683 --> 12:14.716
He'd make a great husband,
he has fantastic hair.

12:14.801 --> 12:15.967
(laughs)

12:16.053 --> 12:18.436
You're a great friend,
Gabe, but I couldn't do that.

12:20.307 --> 12:22.023
I was so sure about what to do before,

12:22.059 --> 12:24.225
and now I have no idea.

12:24.278 --> 12:27.779
You could make a pros and cons list.

12:27.864 --> 12:29.364
Can be very helpful.

12:29.399 --> 12:30.949
Regardless, whatever
it is that you wanna do,

12:31.034 --> 12:33.068
- we're here for you.
- All the way.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.903
Totally.

12:34.988 --> 12:36.404
Thanks, guys.

12:37.658 --> 12:39.157
(David) I don't understand any of this.

12:39.242 --> 12:41.409
Well, I'm trying to...

12:42.546 --> 12:44.462
Jared's not gonna give up Ben.

12:44.548 --> 12:46.548
What?

12:46.583 --> 12:48.249
How do you know that exactly?

12:48.335 --> 12:49.417
Because I went to go and see him.

12:49.503 --> 12:50.719
- Carter!
- What were you thinking?

12:50.754 --> 12:52.137
I couldn't just sit around and do nothing,

12:52.222 --> 12:54.005
I had to at least try and help Ben.

12:54.091 --> 12:55.974
What exactly did Jared say?

12:56.059 --> 12:57.175
He gave me his word

12:57.260 --> 12:58.643
he is not gonna put Ben on that list.

12:58.729 --> 13:00.979
What makes you think his
word is worth anything?

13:01.064 --> 13:02.597
He's lied to you before.

13:04.601 --> 13:06.851
Look, okay, I know this is gonna be hard

13:06.937 --> 13:08.236
for you two to understand.

13:08.305 --> 13:12.607
But I... I actually think
I believe him this time.

13:14.277 --> 13:16.695
Carter...

13:16.780 --> 13:19.030
(doorbell rings)

13:19.116 --> 13:20.532
I'll get it.

13:27.090 --> 13:28.673
Surprise.

13:30.594 --> 13:32.627
Hey.

13:35.610 --> 13:37.827
I can't believe you're here.

13:37.912 --> 13:39.779
Yeah, well, Max said things
were kind of upside-down,

13:39.864 --> 13:43.583
so I figured you could use a friend.

13:43.618 --> 13:47.453
Well, thank you, that's really sweet.

13:47.505 --> 13:49.622
It's really good to see you.

13:51.126 --> 13:52.342
But?

13:54.095 --> 13:56.462
Well, I hope you didn't
feel like you had to come,

13:56.548 --> 13:58.131
like, rescue me or something.

13:58.183 --> 14:00.133
I think you have me
confused with a superhero.

14:00.218 --> 14:02.468
(laughs)

14:02.554 --> 14:04.304
Also, I'm not sure I've ever met anyone

14:04.389 --> 14:06.222
that needed less rescuing.

14:06.308 --> 14:11.027
Tell you the truth, that's
not really how it feels lately.

14:11.112 --> 14:14.147
Look, Carter, we're doing
the friend thing, right?

14:14.232 --> 14:16.649
That's what we agreed on,
and I'm still up for it.

14:16.735 --> 14:18.651
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

14:18.737 --> 14:21.821
Good, I'm gonna go settle in my hotel room

14:21.873 --> 14:24.791
and... polish up my friendship badge.

14:24.826 --> 14:27.160
- (chuckles)
- And we can, uh...

14:28.663 --> 14:29.829
we can catch up later.

14:29.881 --> 14:31.714
Yeah, okay, I'd like that.

14:31.800 --> 14:34.917
I've, uh, got some stuff
I have to sort out first.

14:35.003 --> 14:37.170
Yeah, it seems like it.

14:38.506 --> 14:40.256
Well, I'm here.

14:40.342 --> 14:42.258
If you need anything, just call.

14:42.344 --> 14:43.843
I will.

14:50.518 --> 14:52.902
Thank you.

14:52.987 --> 14:56.189
Seriously, it means everything
to know that you have my back.

14:56.241 --> 14:58.107
Always.

15:00.528 --> 15:02.028
Thanks for meeting me.

15:02.080 --> 15:04.747
Yeah, I never say no to caffeine.

15:06.534 --> 15:09.535
I am sorry you had a hard
time while I was away.

15:09.587 --> 15:12.255
Mostly brought it on myself.

15:13.541 --> 15:15.708
I know you're just trying
to help your foster sister,

15:15.760 --> 15:18.044
but I just wish I'd been around.

15:18.129 --> 15:20.346
Maybe I could've helped out.

15:20.382 --> 15:23.383
Yeah, there's not much you could've done.

15:24.803 --> 15:26.936
Well, I would have like to have tried.

15:28.223 --> 15:29.972
I have a feeling you've had a lot of people

15:30.058 --> 15:32.975
disappoint you in your past, and, uh...

15:33.061 --> 15:35.812
I don't wanna be one of 'em.

15:39.284 --> 15:42.568
I was hoping that it's not too late

15:42.620 --> 15:44.904
for us to get to know each other.

15:44.989 --> 15:49.075
Maybe we could make this a regular thing.

15:50.412 --> 15:52.245
Sure, yeah.

15:53.381 --> 15:55.465
As long as we can skip
the heart-to-heart.

15:57.552 --> 15:58.918
Got it.

16:00.805 --> 16:02.472
- (phone buzzing)
- Thank you.

16:02.557 --> 16:05.758
(Lori) That's the third
time in the last hour.

16:06.845 --> 16:08.511
It's Jared.

16:08.596 --> 16:11.264
He's been texting me all day.

16:11.316 --> 16:13.683
I don't know what to do, I can't just erase

16:13.768 --> 16:15.318
everything he meant to me.

16:15.403 --> 16:17.019
Of course you can't.

16:18.273 --> 16:20.773
Well, apparently you were wrong about me.

16:20.825 --> 16:22.275
How so?

16:22.360 --> 16:24.861
You said I was more grown
up than most grown-ups.

16:24.946 --> 16:27.029
In some ways, you are.

16:28.116 --> 16:30.116
Yeah, I used to think so. Now, I feel like

16:30.201 --> 16:32.418
I can't even trust my own
instincts about people.

16:32.454 --> 16:36.088
That's my fault, Carter, not yours.

16:36.124 --> 16:38.207
What?

16:38.293 --> 16:41.294
Well, look at what you've
been through in your life,

16:41.346 --> 16:43.346
and not just these last few months.

16:43.431 --> 16:46.132
Your experiences have
made you older in some ways

16:46.184 --> 16:48.518
and hurt you in others.

16:48.603 --> 16:50.102
And I'm sorry for that.

16:50.138 --> 16:51.971
I'm not trying to make you feel bad.

16:52.056 --> 16:53.389
I know you're not.

16:53.475 --> 16:56.442
And how could I feel
badly about who you are?

16:56.478 --> 17:00.813
You're independent and unafraid.

17:00.899 --> 17:02.315
And frankly, the way we lived,

17:02.367 --> 17:04.733
you hardly had time to
listen to your instincts,

17:04.819 --> 17:06.786
let alone act on 'em.

17:06.820 --> 17:10.873
And there's consequences for that.

17:13.328 --> 17:15.994
But you have to take care of yourself, hon.

17:16.047 --> 17:20.049
Figure out what you
want, who you wanna trust.

17:20.134 --> 17:23.886
It's not a crime.

17:28.259 --> 17:29.926
(sighs)

17:30.011 --> 17:33.346
(cell phone ringing)

17:35.817 --> 17:37.266
Hey.

17:37.352 --> 17:39.352
Hey.

17:39.437 --> 17:41.521
How you doing?

17:41.606 --> 17:43.189
<i>I'm good.</i>

17:43.274 --> 17:45.024
Yeah.

17:46.861 --> 17:50.613
Jared, I can't do this anymore.

17:50.698 --> 17:51.831
Us.

17:51.866 --> 17:55.751
(sighs) Can I ask why?

17:55.837 --> 17:59.121
All this stuff that's happened lately,

17:59.207 --> 18:01.674
<i>it all ties back to my
relationship with you.</i>

18:01.709 --> 18:04.460
There are a lot of things I
wish had played out differently.

18:04.546 --> 18:05.795
<i>Yeah, me too.</i>

18:05.880 --> 18:10.550
Look, I still care about
you, Jared, I really do.

18:10.635 --> 18:15.438
I just... I need to take
a step back right now.

18:15.523 --> 18:18.641
<i>There's a lot of stuff
I need to figure out.</i>

18:22.397 --> 18:24.981
I'm sorry, I know that's
not what you wanted to hear.

18:25.066 --> 18:26.566
<i>No, it's not.</i>

18:26.618 --> 18:29.118
But I can't make you
feel something you don't.

18:31.122 --> 18:33.239
All I ever wanted was to make you happy.

18:33.324 --> 18:36.409
<i>That's never gonna change.</i>

18:44.135 --> 18:46.385
Hey. What is that?

18:46.421 --> 18:49.088
I signed you up for a
weekly grocery service.

18:49.173 --> 18:51.090
It's all organic.

18:51.175 --> 18:54.060
Okay, what happened with your bills?

18:54.095 --> 18:55.728
It's gonna be fine.

18:55.763 --> 18:58.431
Mom, the money that I gave
you was for your bills.

18:58.516 --> 19:00.933
I know, honey, but you needed this.

19:00.985 --> 19:02.768
You don't have any food in this house.

19:02.854 --> 19:06.072
And if you need anything,
you can order it online.

19:06.107 --> 19:09.275
That is very sweet, but
that's not the point right now.

19:09.327 --> 19:11.444
Hey, I was trying to do
something nice for you

19:11.496 --> 19:12.578
for a change.

19:12.614 --> 19:16.115
I will get the money for
my bills, don't worry.

19:16.167 --> 19:17.617
- You just quit your job!
- Don't worry!

19:17.702 --> 19:20.086
Max, this is really not your problem.

19:20.121 --> 19:21.420
I know, but I'm trying to help.

19:21.456 --> 19:23.339
I give you money for
your bills, and you go out

19:23.424 --> 19:24.924
and you blow it on baguettes.

19:24.959 --> 19:26.759
You know what? I get it.

19:26.794 --> 19:28.594
I made a mistake. Sue me.

19:28.630 --> 19:31.964
You know what, I need...
I need to get some air.

19:34.802 --> 19:35.968
- Mom?
- It's fine.

19:36.054 --> 19:38.771
I'm fine, okay? I'll see you later.

19:38.806 --> 19:41.557
(knocking)

19:41.643 --> 19:42.725
Benjamin Wallace here?

19:42.810 --> 19:44.393
Why?

19:44.479 --> 19:46.195
- Yeah, that's me.
- Benjamin Wallace,

19:46.280 --> 19:47.313
- you're under arrest.
- No.

19:47.398 --> 19:48.648
You have the right to remain silent.

19:48.700 --> 19:50.116
What are the charges? What did he do?

19:50.151 --> 19:51.817
Intent to sell a
controlled substance, ma'am.

19:51.869 --> 19:54.070
He'll be in central booking downtown.

19:54.155 --> 19:55.071
If you cannot afford an attorney,

19:55.156 --> 19:56.155
one will be provided for you.

19:56.240 --> 19:57.823
Ben, don't say anything.

19:57.909 --> 19:59.492
You understand these rights
as I have read them to you?

19:59.544 --> 20:02.378
I will come down there as soon as I can.

20:09.377 --> 20:11.089
Jared promised me.

20:11.754 --> 20:14.921
I'm sorry, honey, but it
definitely came from him.

20:16.141 --> 20:17.841
(sighs) What's gonna happen to Ben?

20:17.926 --> 20:20.477
Well, they're processing him right now,

20:20.562 --> 20:24.097
and then he will be sent
to a juvenile facility.

20:24.149 --> 20:25.565
Such a liar.

20:25.634 --> 20:27.517
When can I see Ben?

20:27.603 --> 20:28.935
Probably not till later.

20:28.988 --> 20:31.321
I'm gonna go back there and I'll find out.

20:31.407 --> 20:33.440
- I'm coming with you.
- No, David, please.

20:33.492 --> 20:34.775
There's nothing for you to do.

20:34.860 --> 20:36.493
I'm just gonna talk to the DA.

20:36.578 --> 20:38.578
He's my son and I'd like to be there.

20:38.614 --> 20:40.447
I understand that, I do.

20:40.499 --> 20:42.833
But please, let me do my job.

20:43.952 --> 20:46.620
Um... Mom, you'll...
you'll call us

20:46.705 --> 20:48.288
as soon as you hear anything?

20:48.340 --> 20:50.123
Of course. Don't worry.

20:58.317 --> 21:00.267
They seem nice here, right?

21:00.352 --> 21:03.103
Yeah, really nice.

21:03.189 --> 21:04.988
Oh, I'm cold. Have you ever noticed

21:05.074 --> 21:07.524
it's super cold in exam rooms?

21:07.610 --> 21:11.528
I'm sure they have a blanket
or something somewhere.

21:14.333 --> 21:16.250
Maybe not.

21:16.285 --> 21:17.835
Here.

21:19.705 --> 21:21.338
Thank you.

21:23.843 --> 21:26.960
Beatrix Castro.

21:27.012 --> 21:28.462
Yeah, that's me.

21:28.547 --> 21:29.930
How are you doing today?

21:29.965 --> 21:32.132
- I'm nervous.
- Okay.

21:32.184 --> 21:33.300
We're gonna talk about each step

21:33.352 --> 21:34.685
before I do anything.

21:34.770 --> 21:36.854
So, you don't need to be nervous.

21:36.939 --> 21:39.306
Is it okay if my friend stays with me?

21:39.358 --> 21:42.392
If she wants to.

21:42.478 --> 21:45.145
Of course I want to.

21:45.231 --> 21:46.813
Thank you.

21:55.541 --> 21:58.325
You at war with the silverware?

21:58.410 --> 22:02.462
(sighs) Sorry, I'm upset about Ben.

22:02.498 --> 22:04.715
I'm trying to understand
how all this happened.

22:04.800 --> 22:07.668
Your... your mom and I talked
about keeping an eye on him.

22:07.720 --> 22:10.304
Dad, she's had a lot on her plate

22:10.339 --> 22:11.722
in the last couple of months.

22:11.807 --> 22:13.307
I know that.

22:13.342 --> 22:15.676
I just shouldn't have...

22:17.396 --> 22:19.346
I should have been here.

22:21.100 --> 22:22.649
Dad, you couldn't have stopped it,

22:22.685 --> 22:25.235
even if you had been here.

22:25.321 --> 22:27.654
She's been amazing.

22:27.690 --> 22:29.856
She put all of her
feelings about Lori aside

22:29.942 --> 22:33.026
so she could help Ben and
I when everything went down.

22:33.112 --> 22:35.445
Wouldn't it have been
more unfair if she told you

22:35.531 --> 22:39.199
while you were away and
couldn't do anything about it?

22:39.251 --> 22:40.701
Is this your
not-so-subtle way

22:40.786 --> 22:42.286
of telling me to back off?

22:42.371 --> 22:44.705
More like my
not-so-subtle reminder

22:44.757 --> 22:46.456
of just how much she's
done to keep everything

22:46.542 --> 22:49.293
together around here.

22:57.386 --> 22:58.719
So, I'd be a narc?

22:58.771 --> 23:00.220
Rick Barnes could be responsible

23:00.272 --> 23:02.689
for all the people who died
from those tainted drugs.

23:02.725 --> 23:05.108
You'd be doing the world a favor.

23:05.194 --> 23:06.643
And I'd get out of here?

23:06.729 --> 23:10.230
Well, first, they'd send
you to a juvenile facility,

23:10.282 --> 23:13.150
and then you'd be able to
go back to Lori's eventually.

23:13.235 --> 23:15.786
(scoffs) Eventually?

23:15.871 --> 23:17.487
Well, they want you to go to a group home

23:17.573 --> 23:19.239
so you can lay low, so
Barnes and his people

23:19.291 --> 23:20.574
won't be able to find you.

23:20.659 --> 23:22.159
I... I don't think we
need to go that far.

23:22.244 --> 23:23.910
Jared never made it sound
like the guy was dangerous.

23:23.996 --> 23:25.579
He's not like a killer or something.

23:25.664 --> 23:28.332
Well, maybe not, but if his
back is against the wall,

23:28.417 --> 23:31.418
you don't know what he'll do.

23:31.503 --> 23:34.588
It's pretty bad karma to be a snitch.

23:34.673 --> 23:37.341
It's bad karma to let a drug dealer

23:37.426 --> 23:38.809
get away with murder.

23:40.729 --> 23:42.012
Yeah.

23:42.097 --> 23:46.516
It's the only way the DA is
gonna drop charges against you.

23:48.187 --> 23:50.103
Why are you doing this?

23:50.189 --> 23:52.322
I said I was gonna help you.

23:52.408 --> 23:54.941
I promised you.

23:57.613 --> 24:01.782
Yeah... you did, and you kept your word.

24:06.255 --> 24:09.172
All right, I'll testify.

24:11.210 --> 24:12.709
I'm glad you called.

24:15.347 --> 24:17.347
You doing okay?

24:17.433 --> 24:19.800
Yeah, I'm all good.

24:21.353 --> 24:24.721
Carter, it's okay to talk to me.

24:24.807 --> 24:28.525
I don't know, it's weird
talking to you about Jared.

24:28.610 --> 24:32.279
Why? We're friends, remember?

24:32.314 --> 24:34.564
Yeah, apparently you have a badge.

24:34.650 --> 24:37.284
Yeah, I do, and I'm not afraid to use it.

24:37.319 --> 24:39.319
(chuckles) It's still weird

24:39.371 --> 24:42.072
talking to your ex-boyfriend
about your other ex-boyfriend.

24:43.992 --> 24:47.994
Okay, I didn't wanna
say anything earlier...

24:48.047 --> 24:49.830
because I knew you had a lot going on.

24:49.915 --> 24:53.166
But if it makes you feel any better...

24:53.218 --> 24:54.751
I'm seeing someone.

24:56.555 --> 24:59.005
Oh.

24:59.058 --> 25:02.008
Um... really?

25:02.061 --> 25:03.143
Yeah.

25:03.178 --> 25:05.262
(chuckles)

25:05.347 --> 25:07.597
So, talk to me.

25:07.683 --> 25:11.568
Um... I don't know.

25:13.021 --> 25:15.021
He once said to me, "When people show you

25:15.074 --> 25:17.657
who they really are,
you should believe them."

25:17.693 --> 25:20.527
And I just... didn't.

25:20.612 --> 25:23.363
That's on him, Carter, not you.

25:23.415 --> 25:25.499
Your only mistake was taking his crap

25:25.534 --> 25:26.833
and twisting it around on yourself.

25:26.869 --> 25:28.585
It takes two to crash.

25:28.670 --> 25:31.621
Sometimes, yeah, but sometimes
people are just messed up.

25:33.342 --> 25:35.342
Look, Carter, I know you.

25:35.377 --> 25:37.544
And I know what you did for me.

25:37.629 --> 25:39.513
You turned your own life around, Crash.

25:39.548 --> 25:41.715
Yeah, but not until I met you.

25:41.767 --> 25:43.550
Everybody else thought I was a lost cause.

25:43.602 --> 25:45.385
Most of all, me.

25:45.471 --> 25:48.472
But you saw something in me
I didn't even see in myself,

25:48.557 --> 25:51.308
and you made me want to live up to it.

25:51.393 --> 25:55.479
Well, I guess I wasn't
wrong about everything.

25:55.564 --> 25:57.230
I guess not.

26:02.404 --> 26:04.070
(David) Can we talk?

26:04.123 --> 26:05.705
Sure.

26:05.741 --> 26:08.408
I just wanna thank you

26:08.460 --> 26:11.912
for working out the deal for Ben.

26:13.549 --> 26:15.165
Of course.

26:16.969 --> 26:19.586
And also...

26:19.638 --> 26:21.922
I'm an ass.

26:23.091 --> 26:24.257
Who told you?

26:24.343 --> 26:26.176
It was on the Internet.

26:26.261 --> 26:29.346
Well, it's a very reliable source, so...

26:29.431 --> 26:31.898
I'm sorry, Liz, I...

26:31.934 --> 26:34.351
I know you did everything
you could to keep the kids

26:34.436 --> 26:36.353
out of trouble, and it
couldn't have been easy

26:36.438 --> 26:38.355
doing it all on your own.

26:38.440 --> 26:40.774
Well, I have to admit, they
did give me a run for my money.

26:40.859 --> 26:43.026
Which would have been the
same whether I was here or not.

26:43.111 --> 26:46.780
You were big enough to
let me go out, do my thing.

26:46.865 --> 26:49.115
I had no right to make you doubt yourself.

26:49.201 --> 26:51.084
Well, for the record,
I never doubted myself.

26:51.119 --> 26:53.119
I had a bunch of people do that for me.

26:53.172 --> 26:54.120
That's not true.

26:54.206 --> 26:55.872
Carter took a lot of responsibility.

26:55.958 --> 26:57.507
She admitted she knew all along

26:57.593 --> 26:59.292
you were looking out for her and for Ben.

26:59.378 --> 27:02.045
She said that? Those words?

27:05.934 --> 27:08.134
Thank you for telling me.

27:10.305 --> 27:15.442
Maybe... you're not as much
of an ass as we thought?

27:15.477 --> 27:17.360
Mmm.

27:17.446 --> 27:20.814
You're like, um... half-ass,

27:20.899 --> 27:23.733
like, um, quarter-ass, like...

27:29.625 --> 27:30.824
(phone buzzing)

27:30.909 --> 27:33.043
Mmm, mmm, mmm. Mmm, mmm.

27:33.128 --> 27:36.213
Oh, I gotta get this. Yeah, Wilson.

27:39.835 --> 27:43.303
Wait, I don't understand.

27:43.338 --> 27:44.921
How did that happen?

27:45.007 --> 27:46.923
Why can't Ben live with Lori?

27:47.009 --> 27:48.592
Social services called

27:48.677 --> 27:50.176
and they're not sending him back to Lori's,

27:50.262 --> 27:52.345
because he was arrested on her watch.

27:52.431 --> 27:54.064
She's losing custody.

27:55.601 --> 27:57.684
Well... well, where's he gonna go?

27:57.736 --> 27:58.685
Back into the system.

27:58.737 --> 28:00.353
We lose him too.

28:00.439 --> 28:02.255
Well, can't he just come and live here?

28:02.324 --> 28:03.240
Maybe... not now.

28:03.325 --> 28:05.275
It's not that easy, it's a long process.

28:05.360 --> 28:06.943
Applications and interviews,

28:07.029 --> 28:08.528
and you need a judge to sign off.

28:08.614 --> 28:09.613
But you're his dad.

28:09.698 --> 28:11.031
But I'm not his legal guardian.

28:11.116 --> 28:12.949
How long would he be in the system for?

28:13.035 --> 28:16.036
Two years, I don't know, till he ages out.

28:25.980 --> 28:29.815
(Carter) We're gonna find a way
to get you out of the system.

28:29.867 --> 28:31.417
Good luck with that.

28:33.738 --> 28:36.455
I shouldn't have gotten
involved in any of this.

28:36.491 --> 28:38.207
I'm sorry.

28:38.293 --> 28:40.660
It's not your fault, I just got sucked in

28:40.712 --> 28:42.328
thinking things could be different for me.

28:42.380 --> 28:44.997
They can be different, Ben,
they're gonna be different.

28:45.049 --> 28:47.249
My mistake was buying in.

28:48.836 --> 28:50.836
I should've known everything
would crash and burn.

28:50.922 --> 28:52.555
Ben, we're gonna get you out.

28:52.640 --> 28:54.256
My parents are doing everything they can.

28:54.342 --> 28:56.092
I know, and I appreciate it.

28:56.177 --> 28:57.310
But what's done is done.

28:57.345 --> 28:59.562
I can't go the next year knowing

28:59.647 --> 29:01.480
you could be going from
one group home to another

29:01.516 --> 29:03.683
and Jared could just be
walking around, a free man.

29:03.735 --> 29:04.850
Forget Jared.

29:04.936 --> 29:07.103
People like him get what's coming to him.

29:07.188 --> 29:09.522
It may not be right away, but trust me,

29:09.607 --> 29:11.073
it will happen.

29:11.159 --> 29:13.025
What is that supposed to mean?

29:15.196 --> 29:17.079
It means don't stress.

29:17.165 --> 29:19.782
What goes around comes around.

29:32.296 --> 29:33.763
Honey, I'm sorry.

29:33.848 --> 29:36.215
Things have been so cold
between us since we fought,

29:36.300 --> 29:40.136
I just... I'm just not
good at confrontation.

29:41.439 --> 29:43.556
Mom, there are worse things.

29:46.227 --> 29:48.310
I'm still figuring things out, Max.

29:48.396 --> 29:51.647
I wish I had it all together,

29:51.733 --> 29:53.115
but I just don't.

29:53.201 --> 29:54.650
Not sure I ever will.

29:56.487 --> 29:59.572
But I need to stand on my own two feet.

30:05.913 --> 30:08.214
(sighs) The thing is,

30:08.249 --> 30:10.416
I've turned you into this person

30:10.468 --> 30:13.085
who feels like it's his
job to save everybody.

30:13.137 --> 30:16.055
No, I don't feel that way.

30:16.090 --> 30:17.923
Really?

30:19.143 --> 30:21.594
Not consciously.

30:21.679 --> 30:26.432
Since you were a kid, you've
been looking out for me.

30:29.270 --> 30:31.404
And I should have been looking out for you.

30:31.439 --> 30:34.273
I didn't... I didn't mind.

30:34.358 --> 30:37.109
I know you didn't. But it's time for you

30:37.195 --> 30:39.612
to stop worrying about everybody else.

30:42.116 --> 30:44.533
I'm gonna go home.

30:46.454 --> 30:48.871
♪ And I found love ♪

30:48.956 --> 30:54.293
♪ Where it wasn't supposed to be ♪

30:54.345 --> 30:57.713
♪ Right in front of me ♪

31:00.351 --> 31:03.803
I'm a mess, man. I
shouldn't have come here.

31:03.888 --> 31:05.855
Carter didn't wanna see you?

31:05.940 --> 31:07.223
No, she did.

31:07.308 --> 31:10.726
But I told her I could be her friend.

31:10.812 --> 31:12.478
But it was really hard
for her to talk to me,

31:12.563 --> 31:14.480
so I was trying to make her feel better,

31:14.565 --> 31:15.781
pretending I could handle it,

31:15.817 --> 31:17.316
and I told her I was seeing someone else.

31:17.368 --> 31:19.819
But you're not.

31:19.904 --> 31:21.370
No, I'm not.

31:21.456 --> 31:23.789
Imaginary girlfriend.

31:23.825 --> 31:26.659
Yeah, well, that made her open up.

31:26.744 --> 31:29.161
Then I had to sit there and listen to her

31:29.213 --> 31:31.163
talk about him.

31:31.249 --> 31:33.833
That's gotta be hard.

31:33.918 --> 31:35.835
I think she's just trying
to figure things out.

31:35.920 --> 31:37.503
Yeah, that's fine.

31:37.588 --> 31:40.172
But I love her, Max, I don't
know if I can be her friend.

31:40.258 --> 31:42.341
Then you gotta do both.

31:42.426 --> 31:44.844
I don't know how.

31:46.013 --> 31:48.347
You do everything that friends do.

31:48.399 --> 31:51.851
You be there for her and you listen to her.

31:53.154 --> 31:55.354
And you don't have to like
everything that you hear,

31:55.439 --> 32:00.075
but... leaving her when she needs you

32:00.161 --> 32:03.245
isn't really an option.

32:03.331 --> 32:05.581
Yeah.

32:10.538 --> 32:12.454
So, you feeling okay?

32:12.540 --> 32:13.873
<i>Sorry I wasn't there.</i>

32:13.958 --> 32:16.375
Taylor was there, she rocked it.

32:16.460 --> 32:18.377
She, uh, updated their insurance system

32:18.462 --> 32:20.179
while I was still in recovery.

32:20.214 --> 32:22.431
<i>Well, your sense of humor's intact.</i>

32:22.517 --> 32:24.266
That's a good sign.

32:24.352 --> 32:26.719
How's Ben doing?

32:28.306 --> 32:30.272
Not good.

32:30.358 --> 32:31.941
I'm sorry he has to go away.

32:32.026 --> 32:34.443
Yeah, me too.

32:34.529 --> 32:36.195
Bird, do you need anything?

32:36.230 --> 32:37.897
No, I'm good.

32:37.949 --> 32:40.232
I'm just really tired.

32:40.284 --> 32:42.034
<i>- You sure?
- Yeah.</i>

32:42.069 --> 32:44.954
I made the right decision.

32:45.039 --> 32:48.207
Okay. I love you.

32:48.242 --> 32:50.292
Me too.

32:50.378 --> 32:51.660
You okay?

32:51.746 --> 32:53.329
Want any more tea? Another blanket?

32:53.414 --> 32:55.130
(chuckles) If I have any more tea,

32:55.216 --> 32:56.332
I'll turn into a teapot.

32:56.417 --> 32:57.633
A cute teapot.

32:57.718 --> 33:01.503
(chuckles) I'd be a cuter champagne flute.

33:01.589 --> 33:03.305
God, I could really use a drink.

33:03.391 --> 33:05.424
I read the pamphlet...
no drinking,

33:05.509 --> 33:07.343
no drugging, no rock and roll.

33:07.428 --> 33:10.930
You'd be a good nurse, Gabe.

33:16.020 --> 33:17.653
Here.

33:17.738 --> 33:19.438
(sniffling) I'm sorry.

33:19.490 --> 33:21.774
No, no, no, don't be sorry.

33:21.859 --> 33:23.325
You can cry.

33:23.411 --> 33:24.610
I just wonder what would have happened

33:24.695 --> 33:26.245
if he was still alive, you know?

33:26.280 --> 33:29.281
Would he have wanted me to do this?

33:29.367 --> 33:31.250
Would I have made the same decision?

33:31.285 --> 33:33.285
I'm sure that Seth would have supported you

33:33.337 --> 33:34.870
no matter what.

33:34.956 --> 33:37.122
We never left anything inside.

33:37.174 --> 33:38.507
He told me that he loved me

33:38.593 --> 33:41.176
and I told him that I loved him.

33:41.262 --> 33:43.212
And we love you.

33:43.297 --> 33:44.964
And you love us.

33:46.634 --> 33:49.301
Well, then we're good.

33:49.353 --> 33:52.805
I really do love you guys.

33:52.890 --> 33:54.773
You're my family.

33:54.809 --> 33:59.445
♪ Shine a light on me ♪

33:59.480 --> 34:05.651
♪ Shine a little light

34:08.572 --> 34:13.659

34:13.744 --> 34:17.329

34:17.380 --> 34:23.918
♪ Shine a little light
shine a little light on me ♪

34:24.005 --> 34:26.672
So, there's no way I can ever get him back?

34:30.844 --> 34:33.344
At least he's not in jail, that's...

34:33.397 --> 34:35.514
He's gonna be safe, no drug charges.

34:35.599 --> 34:38.233
- That's a good thing.
- It is.

34:38.319 --> 34:39.818
Once again, my child

34:39.853 --> 34:41.270
is paying the price for my mistakes.

34:41.355 --> 34:45.491
Lori, you know it's not your fault, right?

34:45.525 --> 34:47.076
He was my responsibility.

34:47.161 --> 34:50.529
Well, we both know that
kids have their own minds.

34:51.916 --> 34:53.032
I'm sorry.

35:00.274 --> 35:03.075
(phone buzzing)

35:03.110 --> 35:05.027
Hey.

35:05.112 --> 35:06.445
Hey, just thought I'd check in,

35:06.497 --> 35:07.746
see how you're doing.

35:07.782 --> 35:11.283
I just saw Ben.

35:11.335 --> 35:14.203
Everything is so screwed up, Crash.

35:14.288 --> 35:15.454
Where is he?

35:15.539 --> 35:16.789
<i>That's the thing.</i>

35:16.874 --> 35:21.043
He's being put back into the system.

35:21.128 --> 35:23.596
This is all my fault.

35:23.631 --> 35:25.130
That's not true, Carter.

35:25.182 --> 35:26.515
<i>Yes it is, Crash.</i>

35:26.601 --> 35:29.268
<i>- I screwed everything up.
- No, you didn't.</i>

35:29.303 --> 35:32.521
Let me come pick you up, or
come to my hotel and we'll talk.

35:32.607 --> 35:34.473
<i>Yeah, okay.</i>

35:34.558 --> 35:37.643
I just have one thing I need to do first.

35:37.728 --> 35:41.230
I'll, uh, get there as soon as I can, okay?

35:41.315 --> 35:43.899
Okay. I'm here.

35:43.985 --> 35:46.318
Bye.

36:02.553 --> 36:05.087
How could you do it?

36:12.137 --> 36:15.743
How could you stand there
and promise me to my face

36:15.843 --> 36:16.876
that you weren't gonna give Ben up,

36:16.961 --> 36:18.044
and then do this?

36:18.129 --> 36:19.261
He screwed things up for himself.

36:19.297 --> 36:20.796
No, you did, Jared, out of spite,

36:20.848 --> 36:22.048
because you didn't get your way.

36:22.133 --> 36:23.799
Not everything's about you, Carter.

36:23.851 --> 36:25.885
The sooner you learn that, the better.

36:25.970 --> 36:29.305
You know, I kept making
excuses for you, Jared.

36:29.357 --> 36:31.724
Saying it was just a bad
choice here, a slip-up there.

36:31.809 --> 36:34.477
No, I don't have to explain
myself to you anymore.

36:34.529 --> 36:35.728
We're done, remember?

36:35.813 --> 36:37.313
I thought you said this wasn't personal.

36:37.365 --> 36:39.115
It's not, but when they asked me about Ben,

36:39.150 --> 36:40.483
I saw no reason to lie.

36:40.535 --> 36:42.368
Because you're such a
stand-up law abiding guy.

36:42.453 --> 36:44.203
Hey, you were the one who walked in here

36:44.288 --> 36:48.240
with a fake ID pretending
to be someone you weren't.

36:48.326 --> 36:49.408
(sighs)

36:50.878 --> 36:53.496
Hey, you okay?

37:02.306 --> 37:07.843
I worry I missed my chance
to be a father to him.

37:07.929 --> 37:11.931
Losing a kid I didn't even get to know.

37:12.016 --> 37:14.350
And... and now, it's too late.

37:22.160 --> 37:27.496
But the idea of him just
out there in the system,

37:27.532 --> 37:29.031
I hate it.

37:30.618 --> 37:32.451
Me too.

37:34.122 --> 37:35.788
He is a good kid.

37:35.873 --> 37:37.373
Mmm.

37:39.010 --> 37:41.460
He doesn't deserve this.

37:41.546 --> 37:44.263
(phone buzzing)

37:46.634 --> 37:47.550
Hey, man.

37:47.635 --> 37:49.301
Hey, have you heard from Carter?

37:49.387 --> 37:50.302
No, why?

37:50.388 --> 37:51.637
She was supposed to meet me here,

37:51.722 --> 37:53.022
and she hasn't shown up.

37:53.057 --> 37:54.557
Maybe she hit traffic.

37:54.609 --> 37:55.891
I don't know. When I talked to her,

37:55.943 --> 37:57.226
she was pretty upset.

37:57.311 --> 37:58.894
<i>She saw Ben and she was blaming herself</i>

37:58.980 --> 38:00.729
because he's going back in the system.

38:00.815 --> 38:02.031
How'd that happen?

38:02.066 --> 38:04.150
She said Jared gave him up.

38:05.570 --> 38:07.736
<i>Okay, stay put, I'm...
I'm sure she'll show up.</i>

38:07.822 --> 38:10.873
Yeah, um... just let me
know if you hear from her.

38:10.908 --> 38:12.958
I will.

38:15.913 --> 38:17.129
Your brother was the one trying to steal

38:17.215 --> 38:18.547
- from my customers.
- Oh, yeah,

38:18.583 --> 38:19.965
Ben's the real villain here.

38:20.051 --> 38:22.001
You'd made it pretty clear that you want

38:22.086 --> 38:24.420
nothing to do with me.
Why should I protect him?

38:24.505 --> 38:26.889
Because the drugs aren't on him, Jared!

38:26.924 --> 38:28.224
Because you wouldn't take responsibility

38:28.259 --> 38:29.758
for any of your actions though.

38:29.811 --> 38:32.394
When are you gonna stop trying
to blame me for everything?

38:32.430 --> 38:34.680
You are just as culpable as I am.

38:34.765 --> 38:37.733
I didn't turn in innocent people, Jared.

38:37.768 --> 38:41.520
I didn't force a 16-year-old
boy to sell drugs for me.

38:41.606 --> 38:43.272
You know, I may have
made some stupid moves,

38:43.324 --> 38:45.191
like ever falling for you,

38:45.276 --> 38:47.776
but nothing that even
compares to what you've done.

38:47.829 --> 38:49.829
Whatever, Carter, I'm just
sick of hearing your voice.

38:49.914 --> 38:51.363
You are not gonna get
away with this, Jared.

38:51.449 --> 38:52.915
Go do whatever you gotta do, huh?

38:52.950 --> 38:54.200
Okay? I'm gonna be busy

38:54.285 --> 38:55.835
putting my life back together!

38:55.920 --> 38:58.170
While everyone else pays for your mistakes.

38:58.256 --> 38:59.839
Grow up, Carter.

38:59.924 --> 39:02.007
This is the way that the world works.

39:03.261 --> 39:05.544
You don't deserve to be a dad.

39:05.630 --> 39:06.795
And you know what?

39:06.848 --> 39:08.631
As soon as the truth
comes out, the only place

39:08.683 --> 39:10.766
your little girl is gonna
see you is in prison.

39:10.801 --> 39:12.301
