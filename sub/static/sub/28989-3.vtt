WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.332
(HARVEY READING)

00:02.419 --> 00:03.875
LOUIS: Okay, people!
Listen up.

00:04.379 --> 00:06.620
A new attorney has
joined us, Faye Richardson.

00:06.715 --> 00:08.797
FAYE: If you want me gone, there's
only one way to make that happen,

00:09.176 --> 00:11.588
convince me you people
can be trusted to fly right.

00:11.678 --> 00:13.715
I want you to find a
loophole in the Bar's bylaws

00:13.805 --> 00:15.842
that I can use
to force them to remove her.

00:16.015 --> 00:18.758
I come here and give you
a chance to clean up your act,

00:19.019 --> 00:21.807
but I find out the managing
partner wants me gone so badly,

00:21.897 --> 00:23.763
he ordered someone
to hack the New York Bar!

00:23.857 --> 00:25.848
Louis, you don't understand.
She knew before I even told her.

00:25.943 --> 00:27.104
Bullshit. You are fired.

00:27.194 --> 00:29.105
Louis, you had no right
to ask him that.

00:29.196 --> 00:30.482
Right, Harvey?

00:30.822 --> 00:32.028
Right.

00:32.115 --> 00:33.105
You're just agreeing
with Donna

00:33.200 --> 00:34.736
because you don't want her
to be mad at you

00:34.826 --> 00:36.191
now that you're
in a relationship.

00:36.537 --> 00:39.199
You may be special master,
but I'm managing partner.

00:39.289 --> 00:40.779
That gives me
certain rights...

00:40.874 --> 00:42.956
You're not
managing partner anymore.

00:43.335 --> 00:44.951
Effective immediately.

00:45.045 --> 00:48.163
You're stripped of your title
and all the duties that go with it.

00:54.638 --> 00:57.096
Here, this might take
the edge off.

00:57.182 --> 00:59.173
Okay, Sheila,
I just got demoted.

00:59.268 --> 01:00.679
It's the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.

01:00.769 --> 01:03.636
How is a cup of rooibos
going to take the edge off?

01:05.566 --> 01:07.307
Just drink it.

01:07.401 --> 01:08.766
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

01:12.489 --> 01:14.696
Good. Now,
I have to ask,

01:15.617 --> 01:16.607
is this really
the worst thing

01:16.702 --> 01:17.692
that's ever happened
to you?

01:17.786 --> 01:19.402
Because as I recall,

01:19.496 --> 01:20.907
you didn't even want
managing partner

01:20.998 --> 01:22.329
when Donna asked you
to take it.

01:22.416 --> 01:24.874
Because she asked me the night
I found out you were pregnant.

01:25.210 --> 01:28.419
It was the only time in my entire life
I would've said I didn't want the job.

01:28.505 --> 01:30.416
And did you actually
enjoy it once you had it?

01:30.507 --> 01:31.963
You know I did.
Really?

01:32.843 --> 01:34.459
Trying to manage
your best friend,

01:34.553 --> 01:36.339
accepting Brian Altman's
resignation,

01:36.430 --> 01:38.296
taking Robert Zane's name
off the wall.

01:38.390 --> 01:40.927
Sheila, you said you fell in love
with me because I was a lion.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.802
Now I'm just a housecat
with his balls cut off.

01:43.895 --> 01:44.885
Louis...
Hear what I just said?

01:44.980 --> 01:45.970
I'm a ball-less cat.

01:46.064 --> 01:47.520
Which reminds me, when
are we getting another cat?

01:47.608 --> 01:48.939
I'll tell you when. Never!

01:49.026 --> 01:50.232
But you said you'd be open
to a hairless!

01:50.319 --> 01:52.105
That was said
in a vulnerable moment!

01:55.240 --> 01:57.151
Louis, the point is,

01:57.868 --> 01:58.903
it's not the end
of the world,

01:58.994 --> 02:01.156
and this isn't going
to last forever.

02:01.246 --> 02:05.615
Sheila, I know the job
wasn't sunshine and rainbows,

02:06.501 --> 02:08.241
but I was getting
really good at it.

02:08.794 --> 02:12.880
And I don't know how long I can
keep going to work not being in charge.

02:20.474 --> 02:23.341
Hey.

02:23.435 --> 02:25.597
Couldn't help but notice you
didn't come over last night.

02:26.438 --> 02:27.473
I know.

02:27.564 --> 02:28.975
Did you also know
that's the first night

02:29.066 --> 02:30.056
we haven't spent
together since...

02:30.150 --> 02:31.140
I did.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.058
Donna, what's going on?

02:33.779 --> 02:34.894
I didn't know
how to make sense

02:34.988 --> 02:36.228
of you taking
my side with Louis

02:36.323 --> 02:37.313
when you didn't agree
with me.

02:37.532 --> 02:38.647
What do you mean?
I thought you would like that.

02:38.742 --> 02:39.982
Well, I don't.

02:40.077 --> 02:42.614
I don't want you saying things
that you don't believe.

02:43.246 --> 02:44.486
And I want to know
why you did it.

02:45.123 --> 02:48.036
I guess because I was
afraid you'd be mad at me.

02:48.627 --> 02:49.913
Well, that's never
stopped you before.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.744
Because before,
we weren't together.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.830
Oh, my God. Of course.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.003
Harvey, I'm not
gonna leave you.

02:57.761 --> 02:59.126
And I'm certainly
not gonna leave you

02:59.221 --> 03:00.507
over something
that happens here.

03:01.098 --> 03:02.759
I also don't want something
that happens here

03:02.849 --> 03:04.510
to be the reason we don't
spend the night together.

03:04.601 --> 03:05.887
Neither do I.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.636
I guess we're just gonna have
to figure out a way

03:08.730 --> 03:11.768
to make sure that our work
doesn't intrude on our lives.

03:12.067 --> 03:14.104
Well, what if I said

03:14.194 --> 03:17.107
we could start by going out
one night a week, just us,

03:17.197 --> 03:19.734
and talk about anything
but this place?

03:20.617 --> 03:22.233
I'd say that's a great idea.

03:26.164 --> 03:27.154
What?

03:27.249 --> 03:29.581
Where did you get this idea for
the whole once-a-week dinner thing?

03:30.001 --> 03:31.036
All right, look.

03:31.128 --> 03:33.586
Once in a while,
not on a regular basis...

03:35.006 --> 03:36.496
I like to watch Oprah
in the mornings.

03:37.259 --> 03:38.715
(CHUCKLES) No way.

03:38.802 --> 03:40.213
It can't be that.
I'm not buying it.

03:40.345 --> 03:41.380
I'm serious, Donna.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.587
You'd be surprised
how common a problem it is

03:43.682 --> 03:46.470
for couples to strike
the right work-life balance.

03:46.601 --> 03:48.933
Who are you? Look, I
know things about you, too.

03:49.146 --> 03:51.433
Does the word "Albuquerque”
mean anything to you?

03:51.523 --> 03:53.059
Now, I told you that
in confidence,

03:53.150 --> 03:54.686
and for you to bring that
up now, that is totally...

03:54.776 --> 03:56.813
You see? I got ya.
GRETCHEN: I hate to interrupt,

03:56.903 --> 03:59.270
but you two need to drop whatever
you're doing and go see Louis.

03:59.364 --> 04:00.729
What is it, Gretchen?

04:01.450 --> 04:03.987
Faye stripped him of
managing partner last night.

04:05.287 --> 04:06.368
Oh, my God.

04:07.414 --> 04:08.904
We need to go
to him right now.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.286
No.

04:11.376 --> 04:12.741
You go to him.

04:12.836 --> 04:14.167
I need to go see Faye.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.503
Isn't it enough
you took his firm?

04:20.594 --> 04:22.005
You had to take
his title, too?

04:22.387 --> 04:24.048
I take it you heard
about Louis.

04:24.139 --> 04:26.597
You're damn right I did,
and this isn't gonna stand.

04:26.683 --> 04:30.142
It is, because he instructed a
subordinate to hack the New York Bar.

04:30.228 --> 04:32.720
He said he didn't order Benjamin
to do that, and I believe him.

04:32.814 --> 04:34.270
I don't care what you believe.

04:34.357 --> 04:36.314
He tried to fire the man
when he got caught.

04:36.401 --> 04:37.391
That's unacceptable.

04:37.486 --> 04:40.148
Damn it, not everybody has
to do everything by your book.

04:40.238 --> 04:42.400
And what you're still
failing to comprehend

04:42.491 --> 04:45.529
is that if you choose to disobey
me, there'll be consequences.

04:45.619 --> 04:48.327
You want consequences,
I'll give you consequences.

04:48.497 --> 04:49.908
What's that supposed
to mean?

04:49.998 --> 04:52.410
It means Louis may not
be managing partner anymore,

04:52.751 --> 04:54.662
but I'm sure as hell not
answering to you.

05:00.175 --> 05:03.543
(SINGING) See the money,
wanna stay for your meal

05:03.637 --> 05:06.925
Get another piece of pie
for your wife

05:07.015 --> 05:10.303
Everybody wanna know
how it feel

05:10.393 --> 05:13.511
Everybody wanna see
what it's like

05:13.605 --> 05:16.563
I'll even eat a bean pie
I don't mind

05:16.858 --> 05:18.644
Me and missy is so early

05:18.735 --> 05:20.317
Busy, busy making money

05:20.403 --> 05:21.393
All right!

05:22.155 --> 05:24.943
All step back
I'm 'bout to dance

05:27.869 --> 05:29.735
The greenback boogie

05:39.506 --> 05:40.496
(EXHALES)

05:40.590 --> 05:41.580
Louis, I just heard.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.507
Well, good for you.
I don't want to talk about it.

05:43.969 --> 05:46.711
Okay, then why don't you tell
me what you're gonna do about it?

05:46.805 --> 05:49.172
I got demoted, Donna.
There's nothing I can do about it,

05:49.266 --> 05:50.631
and I'd rather
not dwell on it,

05:50.725 --> 05:51.886
SO unless you want
to get Harvey

05:51.977 --> 05:54.093
so the two of you
can gang up on me again,

05:54.312 --> 05:55.518
I would rather be alone.

05:55.605 --> 05:56.845
Louis,

05:57.774 --> 05:59.060
we didn't gang up on you.

05:59.150 --> 06:00.185
What the hell
would you call it?

06:00.443 --> 06:01.558
A mistake.

06:01.653 --> 06:03.394
And if it makes
you feel any better,

06:03.488 --> 06:04.728
I already spoke
to Harvey about it,

06:04.823 --> 06:06.063
because you weren't
the only one upset

06:06.157 --> 06:07.147
about him siding
with me.

06:07.242 --> 06:08.232
Why would that upset you?

06:08.326 --> 06:10.158
Probably because my sister
turned every man she was ever with

06:10.245 --> 06:12.031
into a doormat,
but that's not the point.

06:12.163 --> 06:14.120
You have a sister? Not
the point either, Louis.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.198
She's much older, and I
don't want to talk about her.

06:16.459 --> 06:19.668
What I want to say is that what happened
last night will never happen again.

06:21.006 --> 06:23.714
I don't want our relationship
to affect how we treat you.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.087
You really mean that?
I do.

06:29.764 --> 06:31.630
And, Louis, if you ever need
me or Harvey

06:31.725 --> 06:33.432
during any of this
Faye bullshit,

06:33.518 --> 06:34.758
we are here for you.

06:38.565 --> 06:40.522
Hey, you hear
about Louis?

06:40.609 --> 06:42.566
Of course I did.
It's all over the firm.

06:42.652 --> 06:43.733
Well?
Well, what?

06:44.279 --> 06:45.440
What are we gonna do
about it?

06:45.530 --> 06:46.770
We're not gonna do
anything about it,

06:46.865 --> 06:48.355
because doing shit like
whatever you're thinking of

06:48.450 --> 06:49.781
is what got us in this
mess in the first place.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.071
Are you trying
to put this on me?

06:51.161 --> 06:53.869
Samantha, I am fully aware that
you are not the reason she is here,

06:53.955 --> 06:55.866
but now that she is here, I'm
not gonna make things worse

06:55.957 --> 06:57.447
by doing more
unethical shit.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.499
(SIGHS) Then what if we could
come up with a way

06:59.586 --> 07:00.951
to get her out
on the up-and-up?

07:01.338 --> 07:02.328
What kind of way?

07:02.589 --> 07:04.580
I don't know,
but we are lawyers.

07:04.674 --> 07:06.256
We ought to be able
to come up with something.

07:06.343 --> 07:07.333
You're a lawyer?

07:07.427 --> 07:08.588
I thought all you did
was sashay in a room,

07:08.678 --> 07:10.669
tell someone you got them,
and make them do what you want.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.630
Well, that was
my major,

07:12.724 --> 07:14.931
but I have been known
to open a book or two.

07:15.018 --> 07:16.008
(CHUCKLING)

07:16.102 --> 07:17.467
Look, Alex,

07:17.562 --> 07:20.304
I have grown
really fond of Louis.

07:20.565 --> 07:22.181
He's gotta be hurting.

07:22.525 --> 07:24.607
What do you say
we at least give it a try?

07:25.528 --> 07:26.859
Okay, Samantha.

07:27.405 --> 07:28.395
I'm In.

07:31.034 --> 07:32.069
Mr. Specter.

07:32.369 --> 07:34.076
I agreed to meet with you,
but I have to tell you,

07:34.162 --> 07:36.574
the last person I need
right now is another lawyer.

07:36.831 --> 07:38.287
Please, call me Harvey,

07:38.500 --> 07:40.241
and the last person
you need

07:40.335 --> 07:43.248
is another asshole whose
agenda is at odds with your own.

07:43.338 --> 07:44.954
And what agenda is that?

07:45.048 --> 07:46.959
Look, you didn't want
this takeover,

07:47.050 --> 07:49.587
but your board used your own
law firm to push it through anyway.

07:50.136 --> 07:51.171
How do you know that?

07:51.262 --> 07:53.219
Because I know what it's like
to have the house you built

07:53.306 --> 07:55.217
get handed over
to someone else,

07:55.308 --> 07:57.219
and it just so happens
the people doing it to you

07:57.310 --> 07:59.096
are related to the woman
who's doing it to me.

07:59.270 --> 08:00.601
So you're saying
don't hire you

08:00.689 --> 08:02.020
because you care
about me,

08:02.107 --> 08:04.064
do it because we share
a common enemy?

08:04.150 --> 08:05.686
You want your lawyer
to give you a hug,

08:05.777 --> 08:07.063
or you want him to get
the job done?

08:07.278 --> 08:09.189
I want my goddamn
company back.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.896
Then the first thing
we need to do

08:10.991 --> 08:13.323
is put the brakes on this
sale by suing the board.

08:14.202 --> 08:16.239
A CEO can't sue
his own company.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.741
As CEO, no, he can't.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.414
As a shareholder, he can.

08:20.959 --> 08:22.120
(LAUGHS)

08:22.711 --> 08:24.952
Seems like you put a lot
of thought into this

08:25.046 --> 08:26.502
before you came to see me.

08:26.589 --> 08:28.796
Think what I'll do
once you officially hire me.

08:29.592 --> 08:30.798
What do you say?

08:31.386 --> 08:33.673
I say start drafting
that suit.

08:34.179 --> 08:36.421
Took care of that
before I got here, too.

08:37.350 --> 08:41.014
Dan, we do this, they're
not gonna take it lying down.

08:41.438 --> 08:42.928
I need to know
you're all in.

08:43.481 --> 08:45.392
I'm already losing control
of my company.

08:45.483 --> 08:47.394
What else have
I got to lose?

08:52.282 --> 08:53.488
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

08:54.075 --> 08:55.941
Katrina, do you have
a moment?

08:56.536 --> 08:59.244
Actually, Susan, this isn't a
great time. I'm neck-deep in the...

08:59.330 --> 09:01.241
The Versal.ife case,
I know.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.324
Well, you probably don't know
that this firm

09:04.419 --> 09:06.626
nearly lost VersaLife once
because of me

09:06.713 --> 09:08.454
and I'm not about
to let it happen again.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.289
Which is all the more reason
to let me help you.

09:10.467 --> 09:11.457
Help me?

09:11.634 --> 09:13.966
I noticed you've been working
without an associate

09:14.054 --> 09:15.419
ever since Brian resigned.

09:15.513 --> 09:17.299
And you thought if you
could fill Brian's shoes,

09:17.390 --> 09:18.505
I'd take you on
as my associate.

09:18.933 --> 09:19.923
Something like that.

09:20.143 --> 09:22.475
Well, I appreciate you
putting yourself out there,

09:22.562 --> 09:23.802
but I've got this handled.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.854
Look, in your discovery,
there's an email

09:25.940 --> 09:28.932
from your CEO to his board
about their stock tanking.

09:29.402 --> 09:32.815
I know that, but it was
after it had already started.

09:33.490 --> 09:35.151
The original date
was whited out.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.281
See? You can tell.

09:41.331 --> 09:42.537
It's not a smoking gun...

09:42.624 --> 09:44.661
But we need to be able
to explain it.

09:45.794 --> 09:47.205
Good find, Susan.

09:47.545 --> 09:50.128
If you hadn't caught that,
we would've been in trouble.

09:50.757 --> 09:51.747
We?

09:52.258 --> 09:53.464
Does that mean
we're working together?

09:54.344 --> 09:56.176
It means I'm giving you
a chance.

09:56.930 --> 10:00.514
SAUL: Louis, I'm so glad you were
able to have the time to come out.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.011
Well, honestly,
Your Honor,

10:02.268 --> 10:04.179
I could use the time
out of the office.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.352
Don't start with the
"Your Honor" crap, okay?

10:06.481 --> 10:08.643
I'm here as your friend.
Okay, then, Saul...

10:09.484 --> 10:10.770
Old friend.
(CHUCKLES)

10:11.569 --> 10:13.685
Let's get to it. What
kKind of trouble you in?

10:14.405 --> 10:16.567
Louis, I'm not here about my
troubles. I'm here about yours.

10:17.534 --> 10:18.865
What are you
talking about?

10:18.952 --> 10:20.909
You remember when
we were back at Harvard

10:20.995 --> 10:23.578
and you charted out
your whole career?

10:24.290 --> 10:26.281
Partner at
a top law firm, check.

10:26.376 --> 10:27.866
Get my name
on the wall, check.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.668
And once
I've done all that,

10:30.088 --> 10:31.294
become a judge.

10:31.506 --> 10:34.123
But what does that have
to do with anything?

10:34.217 --> 10:35.252
Well, it has to do
with the fact

10:35.343 --> 10:36.833
that Amy Janon's seat
is opening up

10:36.928 --> 10:39.135
and you'd be the perfect
person to replace her.

10:40.014 --> 10:42.005
Saul, are you offering me
a judgeship?

10:42.392 --> 10:43.427
I am.

10:46.020 --> 10:48.057
This has something to do with
Faye Richardson, doesn't it?

10:48.189 --> 10:50.396
Damn it. Louis,
your ship is sinking,

10:50.483 --> 10:51.848
and you shouldn't have
to go down with it.

10:52.110 --> 10:53.817
Saul, that is bullshit.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.728
I can weather this storm,
and I don't need your charity.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.313
It's not charity.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.907
You're the best lawyer
I ever worked with.

11:01.411 --> 11:02.742
And normally I'd say,

11:02.829 --> 11:05.491
"Don't worry.
It'll come around again."

11:05.582 --> 11:08.165
But you come out on the
wrong side of this Faye thing,

11:08.251 --> 11:10.162
and the only robe
you're ever gonna wear

11:10.253 --> 11:12.335
is the one that's hanging
in your bathroom.

11:17.468 --> 11:18.674
What the hell is this?

11:18.761 --> 11:20.593
It's a recusal form
for you to sign.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.172
It turns out, I got a case
against your old firm,

11:23.266 --> 11:25.382
and make no mistake,
I'm taking it.

11:25.768 --> 11:26.849
I get it.

11:26.936 --> 11:29.519
You don't think I've embraced
this firm. Well, I have.

11:30.106 --> 11:32.598
So as long as you
conduct yourself aboveboard,

11:32.692 --> 11:34.649
I won't just sign this,
I'll be rooting for you.

11:34.736 --> 11:37.649
Bullshit. You'll root for the
people who embraced your system.

11:37.739 --> 11:40.026
But won't matter, because
after I kick their ass,

11:40.116 --> 11:41.857
the world's gonna know my
system is better than yours.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.316
And what system is that?

11:43.536 --> 11:46.403
The one where you play
by whatever rules suit you?

11:46.497 --> 11:48.238
Because if that's what
you're gonna use to win this...

11:48.333 --> 11:49.744
I'll tell you what
I'm gonna use to win.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.290
Whatever I fucking have to.

11:51.377 --> 11:52.867
Then I'll be forced
to remind you,

11:52.962 --> 11:54.873
you cross one line, and
you'll be out on your ass.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.830
I don't need to cross
any lines, Faye.

11:56.925 --> 11:58.882
You de-balled
these guys so much,

11:58.968 --> 12:00.584
all I had to do
was threaten a lawsuit,

12:00.678 --> 12:02.260
and they're shaking
in their boots.

12:02.347 --> 12:05.760
So unless you're here to take
my title like you took Louis',

12:05.850 --> 12:07.011
we're done.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.514
I'll be watching you.

12:10.563 --> 12:11.769
Enjoy the show.

12:20.490 --> 12:21.605
LOUIS: Sheila...

12:22.700 --> 12:24.236
I want to talk to you
about something

12:24.327 --> 12:25.567
because you're probably
gonna hear about it anyway,

12:25.662 --> 12:26.902
but I want you
to hear it from me.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.653
What is it, Louis?

12:29.374 --> 12:31.581
I was offered a judgeship,
and I turned it down.

12:33.002 --> 12:36.085
You turned down a judgeship
without even discussing it with me?

12:36.965 --> 12:40.333
Louis, being a judge has
always been your dream.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.004
I know that.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.553
But a judge makes
a fifth of what I do.

12:44.639 --> 12:45.800
We have a child
on the way,

12:46.307 --> 12:48.344
not to mention my firm
is in trouble.

12:48.434 --> 12:50.095
I don't want to leave
my friends in the lurch.

12:50.186 --> 12:51.221
If they were really
your friends,

12:51.312 --> 12:52.894
they wouldn't be asking you
to turn this down.

12:53.064 --> 12:54.270
They didn't ask me
to turn it down,

12:54.357 --> 12:55.347
because I didn't tell
them about it.

12:55.441 --> 12:56.727
Well, you didn't tell me
about it either!

12:56.818 --> 12:57.933
Okay, Sheila,
what is going on?

12:58.027 --> 12:59.313
Where is this
coming from?

13:01.823 --> 13:03.939
I went to Saul, Louis.

13:05.576 --> 13:06.782
You did what?

13:06.869 --> 13:10.282
You said you didn't know how long
you could keep going not being in charge.

13:10.373 --> 13:12.205
So you fabricated
a judgeship for me?

13:12.292 --> 13:13.908
I didn't fabricate anything.

13:14.419 --> 13:18.037
Every time I see the man, he
says you belong on the bench.

13:19.549 --> 13:21.039
When I went to him, Louis,

13:21.884 --> 13:23.750
he was overjoyed.
(CHUCKLES)

13:25.221 --> 13:26.803
He was?
He was.

13:27.890 --> 13:30.052
Louis, Saul said
if things don't work out,

13:31.102 --> 13:33.343
you will never get
this chance again.

13:33.855 --> 13:36.472
All I'm asking is for you
to think about it.

13:37.900 --> 13:40.141
Okay, Sheila.
I'll sleep on it.

13:41.904 --> 13:44.737
Mmm, I got it.

13:45.241 --> 13:47.152
Then lay it on me, because
we've been at this for hours,

13:47.285 --> 13:49.242
and I'm about to give
up. Okay, look here.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.027
"If the presence
of a special master

13:51.122 --> 13:52.908
"causes significant harm
to a firm,

13:53.166 --> 13:54.497
"they can be removed."

13:54.584 --> 13:55.995
But she hasn't caused
any harm.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.001
She hasn't caused
any harm yet.

13:58.087 --> 14:00.954
But if all of a sudden, a
client left, said it was her fault,

14:01.049 --> 14:02.380
and then that started
an avalanche...

14:02.467 --> 14:04.128
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you talking about?

14:04.510 --> 14:05.796
I'm talking about going
to Gavin Andrews,

14:05.928 --> 14:07.339
getting him to
leave... Are you crazy?

14:07.430 --> 14:09.012
Just hear me out.
No, Samantha.

14:09.390 --> 14:11.597
Inducing a client to leave
isn't Faye causing us harm.

14:11.684 --> 14:12.845
It's us causing us harm.

14:12.935 --> 14:14.767
He'd come back!
I don't care!

14:14.896 --> 14:16.728
This discussion is
over. Jesus Christ,

14:16.814 --> 14:18.771
it's one little thing
to get her out of our lives.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.815
It's not a little thing.
It's conspiracy.

14:21.069 --> 14:23.231
And it sure as hell isn't on the
up-and-up like you agreed to.

14:23.321 --> 14:25.653
I don't believe it. When did you
become such a goddamn coward?

14:26.115 --> 14:29.028
Excuse me? You had
Katrina pretend to be me,

14:29.118 --> 14:31.576
and you did that because
you had the balls to win.

14:31.662 --> 14:33.869
And if I say yes because
you call me a coward,

14:33.956 --> 14:34.946
then I am one.

14:35.041 --> 14:36.748
So do what you want,
but I'm not fucking doing it.

14:37.126 --> 14:38.457
And neither should you.

14:45.843 --> 14:47.004
I have to say,

14:47.095 --> 14:50.178
we may end up getting
totally screwed on this, but...

14:51.557 --> 14:53.639
Susan, you have really done
your research.

14:54.519 --> 14:57.011
Thank you.
That means a lot to me.

15:00.817 --> 15:03.104
Can I ask your advice
on something?

15:03.403 --> 15:05.314
It's kind of personal.

15:05.655 --> 15:06.895
Of course, Susan.
What is it?

15:09.951 --> 15:11.567
So there's this paralegal.

15:11.661 --> 15:14.744
He's smart and funny,
and he and I just click.

15:14.831 --> 15:16.538
I've certainly seen
that happen before.

15:16.707 --> 15:19.369
I just... I know how closely
you worked with Brian,

15:19.460 --> 15:22.953
and I guess I want to know
how you kept things professional.

15:23.131 --> 15:24.997
I don't want to get
into me and Brian, Susan,

15:26.008 --> 15:27.544
but if you want my advice,

15:28.511 --> 15:29.922
I'd find
a different paralegal.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.545
Thanks.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.176
All right, let's get
back to this.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.142
Actually, I had an idea.

15:38.146 --> 15:41.184
Lead counsel on the other side
is a longtime family friend.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.060
What if I could convince her
to settle?

15:43.526 --> 15:45.267
That's why you picked
this case, isn't it?

15:46.154 --> 15:48.816
Because you thought you could
use your connections to impress me?

15:48.906 --> 15:51.648
There's nothing wrong with
taking advantage of an opportunity.

15:52.243 --> 15:54.484
No, you're right.
There isn't.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.449
But in
this particular instance,

15:57.540 --> 15:59.907
what you're proposing
isn't going to work.

16:01.169 --> 16:02.330
But how do you know?

16:02.879 --> 16:04.369
Because I know.

16:04.839 --> 16:05.874
But...
Susan,

16:06.382 --> 16:09.340
being an associate means
knowing when to drop it.

16:10.428 --> 16:12.089
Show me you can do that.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.184
(SNORING)

16:26.360 --> 16:27.475
LOUIS: If it pleases
the court,

16:27.570 --> 16:30.278
I would like to tell a story
about a noble ship's captain,

16:30.531 --> 16:32.863
a villainous pirate by the
name of Faye Pooperson,

16:33.159 --> 16:34.945
and a foul miscarriage
of justice.

16:35.036 --> 16:38.074
Objection, Your Honor.
He's testifying.

16:38.623 --> 16:40.159
And my name
isn't Pooperson.

16:40.249 --> 16:41.956
Richardson, Pooperson,
what's the difference?

16:42.168 --> 16:44.250
That's unorthodox,
but I'll allow it.

16:44.378 --> 16:45.584
You're just him
in a wig.

16:45.671 --> 16:47.958
A wig, if I may say,
you are rocking, Your Honor.

16:48.049 --> 16:50.256
If I weren't married,
I'd be all over that.

16:50.551 --> 16:52.417
I bet he's so much better
than Harvey.

16:52.512 --> 16:53.798
I am. Please proceed.

16:53.930 --> 16:56.092
Your Honor, paragraph five
of the nautical code

16:56.182 --> 16:58.549
states that a captain
shall not relinquish command

16:58.643 --> 16:59.974
to a party of pirates.

17:00.061 --> 17:02.598
If anyone here is
a pirate, it's him,

17:02.688 --> 17:05.020
and I am the British navy
in this situation.

17:05.107 --> 17:07.473
Objection! She's hijacking
my metaphor!

17:07.818 --> 17:10.731
Sustained. Miss Pooperson,
this is your only warning.

17:10.820 --> 17:11.935
He hasn't even called
a witness.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.275
She does have a point.

17:13.366 --> 17:16.483
I don't need a witness to prove
my case to this jury of my peers.

17:16.827 --> 17:17.907
Did he say peers?

17:17.994 --> 17:19.861
I know. Can you
believe this guy?

17:20.248 --> 17:21.363
I think we've heard enough.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.698
Mr. Foreman, has the
jury reached a verdict?

17:24.544 --> 17:25.579
We have, Your Honor.

17:25.670 --> 17:28.252
We find the defendant guilty
on all charges.

17:28.464 --> 17:29.795
As if there was any question.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.624
Miss Richardson, I hereby
sentence you to death.

17:33.094 --> 17:36.052
Death? I don't even know
what I'm on trial for!

17:36.222 --> 17:38.634
And that's the beauty of this
whole thing. Bailiff, take her away.

17:39.225 --> 17:41.341
With pleasure.

17:41.435 --> 17:42.846
Well done.
Well done.

17:44.355 --> 17:45.937
(ALL CHEERING)

17:49.610 --> 17:51.226
For the record,

17:51.320 --> 17:53.561
I meant what I said about
him being better than Harvey.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.773
So true, so true.

17:56.867 --> 17:58.198
(SNORTS, CHUCKLES)

17:58.327 --> 18:00.113
So true, so true.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.201
(LAUGHING)

18:04.292 --> 18:06.203
There were really 12 Harveys?

18:06.377 --> 18:08.459
I know, right?
It was fantastic.

18:09.255 --> 18:11.792
Maybe Sheila's right.
Maybe I should say yes.

18:12.466 --> 18:14.582
I'd be in charge, and no one
would ever push me around again.

18:14.969 --> 18:16.130
True, but...

18:16.220 --> 18:17.836
Stan, a jury of Harveys
just found in my favor.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.341
Don't tell me
you're gonna shit on this.

18:19.765 --> 18:22.052
Louis, I'm sorry,

18:22.602 --> 18:24.718
but I must point out

18:25.313 --> 18:28.055
that your dream was filled
with the people you work with.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.599
You are envisioning yourself
in a fantasy world

18:31.110 --> 18:32.851
still surrounded
by them.

18:32.945 --> 18:33.935
What's your point?

18:34.030 --> 18:36.067
My point is,
if you take the job,

18:36.407 --> 18:38.318
they will not be there
with you.

18:39.285 --> 18:40.741
Oh, God.

18:42.580 --> 18:44.696
This whole time, I was worried
about what they would do without me.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.872
I hadn't even thought about
what I'd do without them.

18:48.210 --> 18:50.121
And if you do think
about that?

18:51.547 --> 18:52.708
I think they're
everything to me

18:52.798 --> 18:54.038
and I don't want
to go anywhere.

18:58.721 --> 19:00.758
Donna, good,
I was hoping you were in,

19:00.848 --> 19:02.134
because I need
a little help.

19:02.224 --> 19:03.714
Sure, Faye, with what?

19:03.809 --> 19:05.971
You want me to tell Alex
Williams he's an associate now?

19:06.395 --> 19:08.932
I take it you don't like
my decision regarding Louis.

19:09.023 --> 19:12.141
Dislike is one of the ways of
describing my feelings for you, Faye.

19:12.234 --> 19:13.349
I doubt you want
to hear the other.

19:13.444 --> 19:14.434
Then I'll get to it.

19:14.528 --> 19:17.065
Whether you like it or not, I
am acting managing partner now,

19:17.156 --> 19:19.648
which means I have a full
plate and no help with it.

19:20.868 --> 19:22.199
I need a secretary.

19:25.539 --> 19:26.825
You want me
to be your secretary?

19:26.916 --> 19:29.123
I need you to help me
get through the next few days,

19:29.293 --> 19:30.875
and according
to everyone,

19:30.961 --> 19:33.328
you were the best secretary
this firm ever had.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.838
I was the best secretary
any firm ever had,

19:35.925 --> 19:37.916
which is one of the reasons
I am now COO.

19:38.260 --> 19:40.718
Donna, I know you think
this is below your pay grade...

19:40.805 --> 19:42.091
It is below my pay grade.

19:42.306 --> 19:43.717
But more importantly,
it sends a message

19:43.808 --> 19:45.594
that I am more valuable
as your lackey

19:45.685 --> 19:46.846
than in my real position.

19:46.936 --> 19:49.177
And I've had it with people
talking about messages

19:49.271 --> 19:51.763
when the only message I
keep getting is, "Go to hell."

19:51.941 --> 19:54.649
So if you're as loyal to
this firm as you say you are,

19:54.735 --> 19:56.351
then accept I need you
to do this.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.023
And if I don't?

19:58.989 --> 20:00.900
Are you gonna demote me
like you did to Louis?

20:00.991 --> 20:04.859
Louis used his position to
coerce borderline illegal behavior.

20:04.954 --> 20:07.241
I'm asking you
to manage some files.

20:07.331 --> 20:09.322
I could demote
if you refuse,

20:09.542 --> 20:11.124
but does it really need
to come to that?

20:12.294 --> 20:14.706
You'll have your files taken
care of by the end of the day.

20:15.756 --> 20:17.087
Thank you.

20:27.852 --> 20:29.763
Hey. Can I come in?

20:30.312 --> 20:32.223
If I say no, you gonna say
it's because I'm a coward?

20:33.190 --> 20:34.225
Alex...

20:35.860 --> 20:37.021
I am so sorry.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.189
I should not have said
what I said.

20:39.822 --> 20:41.404
I know it's not
an excuse,

20:41.699 --> 20:44.612
but I've just really been
off-kilter since Robert left.

20:45.369 --> 20:47.451
It might not be
an excuse,

20:47.538 --> 20:48.949
but it's an explanation.

20:49.832 --> 20:51.823
And I hope
I'm not overstepping,

20:51.959 --> 20:54.075
but I think I know
what you need right now.

20:54.170 --> 20:55.160
What do you mean?

20:55.254 --> 20:56.995
When things aren't going well
for me in one part of my life,

20:57.757 --> 20:59.043
I try to look to another.

20:59.133 --> 21:01.465
Usually that other part
is family.

21:02.928 --> 21:04.384
Are you trying to adopt me?

21:04.472 --> 21:06.179
Let's take it
one step at a time.

21:06.932 --> 21:08.969
Why don't you come over to
the house for dinner tonight?

21:09.059 --> 21:11.141
It may not be the answer
to your problems, but...

21:11.353 --> 21:14.516
Rosalie's been asking
about you. Joy loves you.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.393
Are you sure?
Yeah.

21:16.650 --> 21:18.482
I think it'll be fun
for you.

21:19.069 --> 21:21.185
Though if it goes anything
like our lunch with Rosalie,

21:21.280 --> 21:23.271
it sure as shit
won't be fun for me.

21:24.658 --> 21:26.365
You know what I meant.

21:26.619 --> 21:27.700
I did.

21:28.579 --> 21:30.069
You in?

21:31.874 --> 21:34.536
I'd love to.
Thank you, Alex.

21:42.468 --> 21:44.584
Dan, hey. Did you see the...

21:44.678 --> 21:46.168
DAN: What the hell
have you been doing?

21:46.597 --> 21:47.632
What we said I'd do...

21:47.723 --> 21:48.929
Suing them is one thing,

21:49.016 --> 21:51.007
but you took out
a full-page ad

21:51.101 --> 21:52.341
saying that
they're endangering

21:52.436 --> 21:54.052
the entire future
of the company.

21:54.313 --> 21:55.974
Dan, you said you'd stick
with the plan,

21:56.273 --> 21:58.184
and if a thing like this
is gonna rattle you...

21:58.275 --> 21:59.390
DAN: It didn't rattle me.

21:59.485 --> 22:01.351
It rattled them, and it's
gonna be a little difficult

22:01.445 --> 22:03.231
to stick it out
when I've been fired.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.063
What? They can't do that
in the middle of litigation.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.192
Well, they did.

22:06.367 --> 22:08.950
And even if I win this thing,
I won't get my company back.

22:09.119 --> 22:10.780
Listen to me.
It's not over.

22:10.871 --> 22:12.327
I can fix it.
DAN: Then fix it

22:12.414 --> 22:14.246
because if I lose everything
from all this,

22:14.333 --> 22:17.075
instead of suing the board,
I'll be suing you.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.497
HARVEY: You're not gonna
believe this shit. Harvey...

22:23.592 --> 22:25.424
I just got a call
from Dan Foley.

22:25.511 --> 22:27.878
They fired him, and now
he's threatening to sue me.

22:28.097 --> 22:30.054
And I'm sorry about that, but
right now, I don't have time.

22:30.140 --> 22:31.551
Donna, I just told you
I almost got sued...

22:31.642 --> 22:32.848
But you didn't get sued,

22:32.935 --> 22:34.391
and you aren't the only one
sick of that woman.

22:34.645 --> 22:35.635
What?

22:35.729 --> 22:37.561
She had the nerve to ask me
to be her secretary,

22:37.815 --> 22:39.726
so I'm sorry that your
case isn't going well,

22:39.817 --> 22:41.774
but right now, I don't...
Where are you going?

22:41.861 --> 22:43.772
I'm gonna go to that woman and
tell her she can do her own work.

22:43.863 --> 22:44.853
You're not her servant.

22:44.947 --> 22:47.405
Harvey, I don't need you
to fight my battles for me.

22:47.491 --> 22:48.572
And yesterday you said

22:48.659 --> 22:50.616
we shouldn't let what
happens here come between us.

22:50.703 --> 22:51.943
Well, it's coming
between us,

22:52.037 --> 22:53.323
and I'm gonna put
a stop to it.

22:53.414 --> 22:54.700
You're right.
I did say that.

22:55.499 --> 22:58.207
But the way to keep Faye from
coming between us isn't fighting her.

22:58.294 --> 22:59.659
It's using your idea.

22:59.753 --> 23:00.743
What are you talking about?

23:00.838 --> 23:02.203
We're gonna go out
for an early dinner,

23:02.298 --> 23:03.584
and we're gonna talk
about anything

23:03.674 --> 23:05.085
but this place
and that woman.

23:05.175 --> 23:06.882
Donna, my client
just got fired.

23:06.969 --> 23:09.210
And he's still gonna
be fired in three hours,

23:09.305 --> 23:11.012
but if I know you,
if you clear your head,

23:11.098 --> 23:12.714
he might not be fired
in four.

23:13.767 --> 23:14.928
So what do you say?

23:15.352 --> 23:17.184
I say I'm in the mood
for Italian.

23:19.231 --> 23:20.596
Absolutely, thank you.

23:22.818 --> 23:24.855
Katrina, you wanted
to see me?

23:24.987 --> 23:26.569
I didn't just want
to see you, Susan.

23:27.323 --> 23:29.405
I want to know why
you willfully disregarded me

23:29.491 --> 23:31.198
by contacting
your family friend.

23:31.285 --> 23:32.366
Okay, I know you
asked me not to, but...

23:32.453 --> 23:34.990
No, Susan,
I told you not to.

23:35.623 --> 23:37.409
Because not only
is it unprofessional,

23:37.499 --> 23:39.490
it's as much as telling
them they have us.

23:39.752 --> 23:42.619
I'm sorry. I was only
trying to help us win.

23:42.713 --> 23:44.499
No, you were trying
to help yourself,

23:44.924 --> 23:47.291
and that is the last thing
I need in an associate.

23:47.927 --> 23:49.213
You're off this case.

23:54.725 --> 23:56.181
I think you should reconsider.

23:57.728 --> 23:59.059
And why would I ever do that?

24:00.314 --> 24:01.600
Because I know
why Brian really left.

24:03.192 --> 24:04.523
What did you
just say to me?

24:04.652 --> 24:06.768
I said a senior partner
and a married associate

24:06.862 --> 24:09.570
were working closely together,
working nights together,

24:10.115 --> 24:12.982
until suddenly he up and left
with no explanation,

24:13.077 --> 24:14.488
no job lined up...

24:14.620 --> 24:17.032
Susan, you do not want
to do this.

24:17.122 --> 24:18.237
Do what?

24:18.332 --> 24:20.369
Point out that things went too
far and you bought his silence

24:20.459 --> 24:21.915
by giving him
one of your clients?

24:22.670 --> 24:24.035
Brian Altman left

24:24.129 --> 24:26.587
because he decided
it was best for his family.

24:27.091 --> 24:28.422
Yeah, I bet he did.

24:29.677 --> 24:31.133
Well, unless you want
Faye Richardson

24:31.220 --> 24:33.131
to suddenly be made aware
of the situation,

24:33.847 --> 24:36.339
you'll make me your associate
by the end of the week.

24:43.399 --> 24:44.935
Donna, there you are.

24:45.025 --> 24:46.982
No, Gretchen,
there I go,

24:47.069 --> 24:48.309
because I'm just
on my way out.

24:48.862 --> 24:50.944
Well, you might want to stop
by Faye's office first.

24:51.031 --> 24:52.442
She's looking for you.

24:53.575 --> 24:54.906
Listen,

24:54.994 --> 24:57.076
do me a favor and don't
tell her you ran into me.

24:57.246 --> 24:58.486
What's going on, Red?

24:59.456 --> 25:01.322
She asked me to do some
secretarial work for her,

25:01.417 --> 25:02.999
and I didn't finish it.

25:03.085 --> 25:04.575
But I have a dinner
at Quattro Gatti tonight,

25:04.670 --> 25:06.035
and I absolutely
cannot move it.

25:06.213 --> 25:08.420
Which means you need someone
to run interference

25:08.507 --> 25:11.295
while you and Harvey
get your smush face on.

25:12.094 --> 25:13.380
That's right. I said it.

25:13.721 --> 25:16.383
Wait. You know
about me and Harvey?

25:16.473 --> 25:19.215
Please, you think Louis
can keep his mouth shut?

25:19.309 --> 25:20.925
I asked him
what he wanted for lunch,

25:21.020 --> 25:22.306
and he blurted out,

25:22.438 --> 25:24.020
"Harvey and Donna did it!"

25:24.189 --> 25:25.475
Did he really do that?

25:25.566 --> 25:26.727
Might as well have.

25:26.817 --> 25:27.898
(CHUCKLES)

25:28.986 --> 25:31.353
I'm happy for you, darling.
So you go on out to dinner.

25:31.447 --> 25:33.654
I'll take care of whatever
Miss High and Mighty needs.

25:33.741 --> 25:36.153
No, Gretchen, I couldn't
ask you to do that for me.

25:36.243 --> 25:37.733
You're not asking.
I'm telling.

25:38.412 --> 25:40.949
Don't worry. I'll be so
good to that woman,

25:41.040 --> 25:43.372
she won't even think
to ask where you are.

25:44.209 --> 25:45.540
Thank you, Gretchen.

25:46.670 --> 25:48.035
I owe you one.

25:55.220 --> 25:58.679
Hey, you. Girl with coffee.
Any idea where Gretchen is?

25:58.849 --> 26:00.010
I'm sorry, I don't.

26:00.100 --> 26:01.841
Well, if you see her, tell her
I've been looking all over for her.

26:02.352 --> 26:03.808
I know where she is,
Louis. Jesus Christ.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.557
In fact, I've been looking
all over for you.

26:05.773 --> 26:07.764
She's working for me
on a temporary basis.

26:07.858 --> 26:09.098
I'm sorry.
Say that again,

26:09.193 --> 26:10.683
because my ears are a
little clogged with rage.

26:10.778 --> 26:13.019
She did some work for me.
It was excellent...

26:13.113 --> 26:15.445
Well, then clone her, because
you're not taking my secretary.

26:15.532 --> 26:17.569
I didn't want
your secretary, Louis.

26:17.659 --> 26:19.195
I asked Donna
to handle my work,

26:19.495 --> 26:21.907
but she pawned it off on
Gretchen, and here we are.

26:21.997 --> 26:24.238
I don't care what Donna did.
You have no right to do this.

26:24.333 --> 26:26.825
Louis, if you just calm
down, I assure you,

26:26.919 --> 26:29.251
once I get up and running,
you can have her back.

26:29.338 --> 26:30.920
And if I don't calm down?

26:31.548 --> 26:34.461
You know, I hear that
a lot, "And if I don't?"

26:35.010 --> 26:36.876
Well, not everything's
a threat, Louis.

26:36.970 --> 26:38.631
But if you insist
on making it one,

26:38.722 --> 26:41.089
I promise you'll find
what you're looking for.

26:47.648 --> 26:48.854
Oh, isn't this nice?

26:49.858 --> 26:51.019
Where the hell is Donna?

26:51.110 --> 26:53.351
Calm down, Louis. I'm
not gonna be here forever.

26:53.445 --> 26:55.027
You are not gonna be
here at all,

26:55.114 --> 26:56.821
because it doesn't take
a genius to figure out

26:56.907 --> 26:57.988
that she went
for a tryst with Harvey.

26:58.075 --> 26:59.361
You got stuck
holding the ball,

26:59.451 --> 27:00.941
and I'm getting her
back in here right now.

27:01.036 --> 27:03.152
It wasn't a tryst,
and I didn't get stuck.

27:03.539 --> 27:04.620
I volunteered.

27:04.706 --> 27:05.787
Why the hell
would you do that?

27:05.874 --> 27:07.364
"Cause they're starting
a new relationship.

27:07.459 --> 27:10.247
And if you cared about them
at all, you'd leave them alone.

27:10.337 --> 27:12.453
Are you telling me they couldn't
pick up the phone when I called?

27:12.548 --> 27:14.414
They probably
didn't even see the call.

27:14.591 --> 27:15.706
They're out together.

27:16.135 --> 27:17.375
Can't you understand that?

27:17.511 --> 27:18.546
Gretchen...

27:18.637 --> 27:21.470
I have endured more
humiliation in the last week

27:21.890 --> 27:23.472
than I ever thought
was possible.

27:24.309 --> 27:25.640
Donna specifically told me

27:25.727 --> 27:27.388
that she would not let her
relationship with Harvey

27:27.479 --> 27:29.390
get in the way
if I needed support.

27:29.481 --> 27:30.767
On a scale from one to 10,

27:30.858 --> 27:32.599
how much support do
you think I need right now?

27:32.693 --> 27:36.106
Okay, Louis, I'm gonna
tell you where they are,

27:36.196 --> 27:38.107
but I think you should
let it go till tomorrow.

27:40.951 --> 27:43.864
The thing that really sets me
off is her holier-than-thou act.

27:43.954 --> 27:45.570
I mean, nobody
is that goody two-shoes.

27:45.664 --> 27:46.825
Yeah, well,
what if she is?

27:46.999 --> 27:49.081
And what if Bill Buckner
would've fielded that ball?

27:50.002 --> 27:51.584
Okay, I don't know
who that is,

27:51.670 --> 27:53.286
but it is time
we changed the subject,

27:53.380 --> 27:54.791
because we said
no work talk,

27:54.882 --> 27:56.919
and we just spent half a bottle
of wine on Faye Richardson.

27:57.217 --> 27:58.298
You're right.

27:58.427 --> 28:00.009
Let's talk about something
else. Anything else.

28:13.650 --> 28:15.140
Water's pretty good.
Yeah.

28:15.235 --> 28:17.272
It's wet. It's very wet.

28:21.825 --> 28:24.192
So, have you read
any good books lately?

28:25.162 --> 28:26.652
Books?

28:26.747 --> 28:28.533
That's the best you've got?
Water and books?

28:28.624 --> 28:30.661
Hey, I don't see you
holding up your end.

28:30.834 --> 28:32.416
"Water is wet"?
Who says that?

28:32.502 --> 28:33.663
I know! I got flustered!

28:34.922 --> 28:36.538
And I mean, who wouldn't?

28:36.673 --> 28:38.255
We have spent
almost every minute

28:38.342 --> 28:40.379
of every day together
for the last 15 years,

28:40.469 --> 28:43.006
and now we can't think of a
single thing to say to each other.

28:43.096 --> 28:44.086
What if that's it?

28:44.723 --> 28:47.215
What if we're all out of
things to say to each other?

28:47.351 --> 28:49.342
That's what you say
to me when I'm worried

28:49.436 --> 28:50.722
that we have nothing
to say?

28:50.854 --> 28:52.265
What is wrong with
you? Oh, my God.

28:52.356 --> 28:53.346
What?

28:53.440 --> 28:55.022
You just reminded me
of Ricky Garfield's mom.

28:55.901 --> 28:57.812
He was new in town.
I was 16 years old.

28:57.903 --> 29:01.146
I went over to his house, and
there she was, beautiful redhead.

29:01.657 --> 29:03.773
Had a crush on her
from the second I saw her.

29:04.618 --> 29:06.985
Just realized you've always
reminded me of her.

29:09.414 --> 29:10.404
What?

29:10.999 --> 29:14.742
It's just nice to know that there are
still things I get to find out about you.

29:15.545 --> 29:16.751
I like that.

29:17.172 --> 29:19.960
Now how about you tell me
something I don't know about you?

29:21.176 --> 29:22.541
(INHALES DEEPLY)

29:24.054 --> 29:26.512
Alex, thank you for
inviting me to your home.

29:26.598 --> 29:28.054
This is exactly
what I needed.

29:28.225 --> 29:30.967
Well, I sure as hell couldn't take
you bowling like I did with Louis.

29:31.061 --> 29:33.553
You took Louis bowling?
How did that go?

29:33.647 --> 29:34.637
You'd be surprised.

29:34.773 --> 29:35.763
He actually bowled
a perfect game.

29:35.857 --> 29:37.313
Get out.
I shit you not.

29:37.651 --> 29:39.392
All I had to do was help
him tap into his rage.

29:39.528 --> 29:40.518
I can see that.

29:40.612 --> 29:42.353
A few months ago,
we confronted his mugger.

29:42.447 --> 29:43.858
He turned
into a wild animal.

29:43.949 --> 29:45.565
Whoa, look who decided
to show up!

29:45.659 --> 29:48.242
And perfect timing.
I've got Chinese.

29:48.412 --> 29:49.777
Samantha, you can have
Debbie's seat.

29:49.871 --> 29:50.906
She's got tap tonight.

29:50.998 --> 29:52.238
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that.

29:52.332 --> 29:53.367
I was looking forward
to meeting her,

29:53.458 --> 29:54.823
because if she's half
as cool as her sister...

29:54.918 --> 29:55.908
She's not.

29:56.003 --> 29:57.334
Nothing like the love
of a sibling.

29:57.462 --> 30:00.295
(SAMANTHA LAUGHS)
Hey, babe, I saw your bumper.

30:00.382 --> 30:01.668
Did you want me to take
your car in tomorrow?

30:01.758 --> 30:03.044
What are you
talking about?

30:03.510 --> 30:05.376
Have you not seen
the back of your car?

30:05.470 --> 30:07.507
Looks like you hit
a yellow water buffalo.

30:07.597 --> 30:08.803
Well, that's interesting,

30:08.890 --> 30:11.222
because the last person
to drive the car was Joy.

30:12.019 --> 30:14.306
Don't look at me. Maybe
somebody backed into you.

30:14.396 --> 30:15.727
Joy, what happened?

30:16.732 --> 30:19.690
Fine, I hit a pole in the parking
garage. It's not a big deal.

30:19.776 --> 30:20.891
The big deal is that

30:20.986 --> 30:22.522
you were hoping
we wouldn't notice

30:22.612 --> 30:24.148
until long after
you'd driven the car.

30:24.489 --> 30:27.106
I wasn't thinking that. I just
didn't want you to be mad at me.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.191
And we wouldn't have been,
but we are now.

30:29.286 --> 30:31.277
You have two choices.
You either pay for it,

30:31.371 --> 30:33.408
or you're not driving
anywhere for a month.

30:33.498 --> 30:35.580
What... That's so unfair!
Fair or not,

30:35.667 --> 30:36.657
that's the way
it's gonna be.

30:37.127 --> 30:38.868
Now, let's all sit down

30:39.296 --> 30:41.253
and try to still have
a pleasant evening.

30:45.969 --> 30:47.676
DONNA: I'm just
saying, it's not unusual

30:47.763 --> 30:50.380
for a person to think that
after they've had one.

30:50.599 --> 30:53.591
You thought you'd been
poisoned by a peppercorn?

30:53.977 --> 30:57.345
A Szechuan peppercorn, and I
didn't think that it poisoned me.

30:57.439 --> 30:59.055
I thought someone
had poisoned me.

30:59.566 --> 31:00.772
Haven't you ever had one?

31:00.859 --> 31:02.725
The pertinent question
isn't whether I've had them.

31:02.819 --> 31:05.356
It's, what did you do
to deserve getting poisoned?

31:05.447 --> 31:06.903
Well, that is
neither here nor there.

31:06.990 --> 31:08.526
I knew it.
You're a black widow.

31:08.784 --> 31:09.819
Harvey, if I was
a black widow,

31:09.910 --> 31:11.241
I'd be the one doing
the poisoning.

31:11.328 --> 31:13.194
You seem to know too much
about this subject.

31:13.497 --> 31:14.578
I'm breaking up with you.

31:14.664 --> 31:17.326
Good, I really think this
whole thing has run its course.

31:18.794 --> 31:20.125
Holy shit.

31:20.629 --> 31:22.211
Clearing my head
really did help.

31:22.672 --> 31:24.333
I think I know
why they fired Dan.

31:25.384 --> 31:26.966
And I think I know
what I'm gonna do about it.

31:27.052 --> 31:28.417
Then let's go do it.

31:28.512 --> 31:30.594
No. Not until tomorrow.

31:30.680 --> 31:32.011
Tonight is for us.

31:32.933 --> 31:34.264
You know, I think
you might be getting

31:34.351 --> 31:35.807
the hang of this
whole dinner thing.

31:36.645 --> 31:38.101
Telling me old stories,

31:39.439 --> 31:40.895
making me feel...

31:41.525 --> 31:42.731
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

31:43.443 --> 31:46.811
Oh, shoot, it's Louis.
Maybe I should get it.

31:46.905 --> 31:49.112
Donna, the whole point
of tonight was just us.

31:49.199 --> 31:51.065
I know, but after
the whole Faye thing,

31:51.159 --> 31:53.241
I promised that we'd be there
for him if he needed us.

31:53.328 --> 31:55.319
If there's an emergency,
he'll leave a voice mail.

31:55.414 --> 31:56.825
You can call him right back.

32:01.503 --> 32:03.540
Good. Now, we are gonna
pay the check,

32:03.630 --> 32:05.746
and then I'm gonna go home
and I'm gonna be young Harvey,

32:05.841 --> 32:07.832
and you are gonna be
Ricky Garfield's mom.

32:08.093 --> 32:09.299
(DONNA GIGGLING)

32:22.315 --> 32:23.430
You're in early.

32:23.525 --> 32:25.732
I usually am.
What can I do for you?

32:27.112 --> 32:29.695
I had dinner last night
with Alex and his family,

32:29.781 --> 32:32.113
and it reminded me that the
closest thing I have to family

32:32.200 --> 32:33.861
are the people
at this firm.

32:34.286 --> 32:37.574
I never thanked you for
standing up to me with Lucas, so,

32:38.915 --> 32:40.405
thank you.

32:42.294 --> 32:44.001
Speaking of standing up,

32:44.087 --> 32:46.294
I stood up to you
more than once.

32:46.381 --> 32:49.123
How did you know when to
give in to me and when not to?

32:49.468 --> 32:51.505
Every time
you stood up to me,

32:51.595 --> 32:52.881
I backed down

32:53.138 --> 32:54.799
because you were
in the right.

32:55.056 --> 32:57.718
So I guess the question is,
are you in the right?

32:58.143 --> 32:59.554
I am in the right.

33:00.061 --> 33:02.428
The problem is,
the person standing up to me

33:03.106 --> 33:04.892
has information
I don't want coming out.

33:06.026 --> 33:08.939
Well, I can't tell you
the answer, Katrina,

33:09.029 --> 33:10.986
but I can tell you,
whoever it is,

33:11.072 --> 33:13.655
if you give them an inch,
they will take a mile.

33:18.330 --> 33:19.661
You fired him,
didn't you?

33:20.081 --> 33:21.071
What?

33:21.166 --> 33:24.500
You ran Johnson and Powell when
Dan Foley's contract was written.

33:24.878 --> 33:26.368
You knew there was a clause
that allowed them

33:26.463 --> 33:28.625
to fire him during litigation,
and you had them pull the trigger.

33:28.715 --> 33:29.796
Are you out of your mind?

33:29.883 --> 33:32.170
Are you gonna tell me you didn't have
a conversation with them about me?

33:32.260 --> 33:33.421
Excuse me?

33:33.595 --> 33:35.836
Right there.
A 15-minute call

33:35.931 --> 33:37.296
with you and Johnson
and Powell

33:37.390 --> 33:39.222
not two hours
after you and I spoke.

33:39.309 --> 33:40.765
You dug into
my phone records?

33:40.852 --> 33:43.389
Answer my question, or
we'll do it in a deposition.

33:43.605 --> 33:45.061
Did you talk to them
about me?

33:45.232 --> 33:46.722
I have a subpoena
right here,

33:46.816 --> 33:48.648
and, Faye,
it isn't gonna look good

33:48.735 --> 33:50.601
having an ethics expert
lie under oath.

33:51.446 --> 33:53.608
Okay. You're right.
You got to me.

33:54.157 --> 33:55.693
You pissed me off so much,

33:55.784 --> 33:57.491
I was rooting
for you to lose,

33:57.577 --> 34:00.239
but unlike you,
I wouldn't act on that.

34:00.455 --> 34:01.866
Then how do you
explain the phone call?

34:01.957 --> 34:04.244
Easily. I didn't call them.
They called me.

34:04.459 --> 34:07.793
And the reason they did was to
say what an asshole you were.

34:08.129 --> 34:09.790
It was a 15-minute
phone call.

34:09.880 --> 34:11.463
They had plenty
to say on the matter,

34:11.550 --> 34:13.257
but what they didn't do
is ask for my help,

34:13.342 --> 34:14.754
because if they had,

34:14.928 --> 34:17.511
my next call would've been
to the New York Bar.

34:17.597 --> 34:19.257
Bullshit.

34:21.309 --> 34:24.552
Then subpoena me. I'll be
happy to say all that under oath.

34:24.771 --> 34:25.886
And while you're at it,

34:25.981 --> 34:28.598
subpoena Johnson and Powell.
They'll say the same thing.

34:28.692 --> 34:30.399
And then
maybe you'll realize

34:30.485 --> 34:32.976
all you accomplished
by taking this case

34:33.071 --> 34:35.984
was getting Dan Foley fired.

34:43.123 --> 34:44.784
Susan, do you mind
coming with me?

34:45.250 --> 34:47.661
I take it you thought
about what we discussed?

34:48.128 --> 34:49.163
I did.

34:49.254 --> 34:52.167
And if you're going to be my
associate, you'll need an office.

34:52.257 --> 34:53.793
We just need
to get it approved.

35:02.559 --> 35:04.550
Katrina, (SIGHS) I've
had a bit of a long morning,

35:04.686 --> 35:06.927
so whateveriit is...
This'll just take a minute.

35:07.022 --> 35:09.013
I know you run
a tight ethical ship,

35:09.149 --> 35:12.312
and Susan has something she
would like to bring to your attention.

35:12.694 --> 35:14.025
I'm listening.

35:15.655 --> 35:18.113
Susan's too modest to
toot her own horn, so I will.

35:18.575 --> 35:20.782
We were working
on the Versalife case together

35:20.869 --> 35:22.985
when Susan made
a mistake.

35:23.413 --> 35:25.620
That doesn't sound like
something to toot your horn about.

35:25.707 --> 35:26.868
KATRINA:
It wasn't the mistake.

35:26.958 --> 35:28.164
It's what she
did afterwards.

35:28.335 --> 35:31.293
Susan came to me and
owned up to what she did.

35:32.130 --> 35:33.370
Is this true?

35:35.258 --> 35:36.464
Yes, it is.

35:36.593 --> 35:39.711
Then it's nice to know the culture
here hasn't corrupted everyone.

35:41.014 --> 35:42.675
Was there something else?

35:43.141 --> 35:44.131
Susan?

35:46.144 --> 35:47.384
No, nothing else.

35:48.104 --> 35:49.469
Then keep up the good work.

36:00.241 --> 36:02.448
Louis, whatever it is,
now is not a great time.

36:02.535 --> 36:04.651
Oh, I'm sure it's not.
Never seems to be anymore.

36:04.829 --> 36:06.160
I just thought you should be
the first to know.

36:06.498 --> 36:07.488
Know what?

36:07.666 --> 36:08.747
I'm leaving.

36:08.833 --> 36:10.039
To take a judgeship.

36:12.879 --> 36:14.620
Now? You're leaving now?

36:14.714 --> 36:15.704
I know it's not
great timing, but...

36:15.799 --> 36:18.040
Are you kidding me?
How could you do this to us?

36:18.468 --> 36:19.879
We're in the middle
of a war!

36:19.969 --> 36:23.382
A war that has cost me
my title and my dignity.

36:23.473 --> 36:25.635
And I keep waiting for the
shoes to finish dropping,

36:25.892 --> 36:27.178
but they keep raining down.

36:27.268 --> 36:29.259
Well, then let it rain!
You can fight this.

36:29.354 --> 36:30.970
Don't you get it?
I'm not you.

36:31.356 --> 36:32.517
I'm not the guy
it works out for.

36:32.607 --> 36:33.768
You don't need to be me.

36:33.858 --> 36:34.848
No, I don't,

36:34.943 --> 36:37.856
but I don't even have you
in my goddamn corner anymore.

36:37.946 --> 36:38.936
Louis...
Okay, you know what? Fine!

36:39.030 --> 36:40.270
You want the truth?

36:41.032 --> 36:44.070
I can take every last humiliation
that woman can dish out,

36:44.160 --> 36:45.400
but the one thing
that I can't take

36:45.495 --> 36:47.406
is you and Donna
laughing at me.

36:47.539 --> 36:49.405
What are you talking
about? I saw you.

36:49.999 --> 36:51.410
I went to your restaurant
last night.

36:51.501 --> 36:52.787
I saw you see
it was me calling,

36:52.877 --> 36:55.335
you sent it to voice mail,
and you started laughing.

36:56.423 --> 36:58.039
We weren't laughing at you.

36:58.675 --> 37:01.007
We agreed not
to let work intrude,

37:01.386 --> 37:04.253
so we didn't answer, and then I
made a joke about something else.

37:06.182 --> 37:07.388
Swear to me that's true.

37:07.475 --> 37:08.636
I swear.

37:09.394 --> 37:10.680
Louis...

37:11.855 --> 37:13.220
I'm in your corner.

37:15.275 --> 37:16.390
But you didn't even
come see me.

37:16.484 --> 37:18.145
Because I've been
fighting for you.

37:23.491 --> 37:26.324
I get that, Harvey,
but the truth is,

37:27.912 --> 37:29.402
I'd rather you'd just
come sit with me

37:29.497 --> 37:31.113
than go tilting
at windmills.

37:31.291 --> 37:33.123
Windmills? What are you
talking about?

37:33.209 --> 37:34.995
It's Man of La Mancha.
Why do I even?

37:39.883 --> 37:41.419
I should've come
to you, Louis.

37:42.343 --> 37:43.708
I just didn't know
what to say,

37:43.803 --> 37:45.385
because I couldn't stand

37:45.680 --> 37:47.341
what she was doing
to my friend.

37:47.766 --> 37:51.259
So, you want to become
a judge, I understand.

37:51.352 --> 37:54.765
It's just, we've been
through so much together.

37:54.939 --> 37:57.806
Please, don't let me
tilting at wind chimes

37:57.901 --> 38:00.017
be the thing
that pulls us apart.

38:00.695 --> 38:01.981
It's windmills.

38:02.989 --> 38:04.650
Windmills, whatever.

38:12.832 --> 38:14.618
I was wondering
when you'd show up.

38:16.503 --> 38:19.245
How did you know I wouldn't
tell Faye about you and Brian?

38:20.423 --> 38:21.754
I didn't.

38:21.841 --> 38:24.128
I just knew I'd rather
you tell her than find out

38:24.219 --> 38:25.801
what you'd be like
in six months.

38:26.346 --> 38:27.757
Then why not
just turn me in?

38:29.432 --> 38:32.220
Because I was ambitious
when I first got here, too.

38:33.394 --> 38:35.681
And ambition isn't
a bad thing, Susan,

38:37.273 --> 38:38.729
but it can't be
all you have.

38:48.785 --> 38:51.072
Alex, do you have a sec?

38:51.412 --> 38:53.574
Yes, and before
you say anything,

38:53.665 --> 38:54.700
I'm sorry
about last night.

38:54.999 --> 38:56.330
It's not what I had
in mind.

38:56.417 --> 39:00.251
Actually, I came here
to thank you for it.

39:01.005 --> 39:04.623
Come on, Samantha. I know
my daughter. It was terrible.

39:04.717 --> 39:06.128
It wasn't terrible.

39:06.261 --> 39:09.424
It was family, and it was
exactly what I needed.

39:09.514 --> 39:11.471
(CHUCKLES) Well,
if that's what you needed,

39:11.808 --> 39:13.048
you're in worse shape
than I thought.

39:13.142 --> 39:15.600
I decided to find out
who my biological parents are.

39:17.772 --> 39:18.762
What?

39:19.732 --> 39:21.097
I wasn't gonna tell you,

39:22.110 --> 39:23.350
but you're being
such a dipshit,

39:23.444 --> 39:24.900
I thought you should know.

39:25.655 --> 39:28.647
Even watching you fight
made me appreciate

39:28.825 --> 39:30.532
what a wonderful family
you have.

39:31.661 --> 39:35.450
And then I got to thinking
how Joy is so much a cross

39:35.540 --> 39:37.622
between you and Rosalie,

39:38.042 --> 39:39.874
and I thought,

39:40.712 --> 39:41.873
I have to know.

39:43.256 --> 39:44.542
So all I have to do
is be a dipshit

39:44.632 --> 39:46.088
and you'll show me
your soft side?

39:46.885 --> 39:48.125
Worked for Robert.

39:50.513 --> 39:52.675
Thank you for trusting me
with that, Samantha.

39:53.433 --> 39:54.719
It means a lot.

39:56.185 --> 39:57.425
It means a lot to me, too.

39:58.396 --> 39:59.978
Thanks for having me over.

40:05.486 --> 40:06.692
(SHEILA AND DONNA LAUGHING)
SHEILA: Yup.

40:06.863 --> 40:08.900
DONNA: Okay, wait,
let me get this straight.

40:08.990 --> 40:10.697
His mankini
was your idea?

40:10.783 --> 40:12.615
SHEILA: You'd be surprised
how much a little constriction

40:12.702 --> 40:14.363
increases virility
in the bedroom.

40:14.621 --> 40:16.362
That is an unwanted fact.

40:16.789 --> 40:17.824
Donna.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.161
What are you doing here?

40:20.251 --> 40:23.334
She came over to say how much
she wants you to stay at the firm.

40:24.213 --> 40:26.830
I'll admit, at first,
I wasn't in favor...

40:26.925 --> 40:29.758
But then I told her that Harvey
and I would never leave you.

40:30.970 --> 40:33.177
Then I guess it's a good thing
I already decided to stay.

40:34.098 --> 40:35.133
You did?

40:35.683 --> 40:36.673
I did.

40:36.893 --> 40:37.928
Well,

40:38.311 --> 40:40.302
now that I don't have to spend
the rest of my night begging,

40:40.396 --> 40:43.514
there really is just one
thing left for us to do.

40:46.277 --> 40:47.608
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

40:47.987 --> 40:48.977
I am.

40:49.072 --> 40:50.062
(IN SING-SONG VOICE)
Girls' night.

40:50.156 --> 40:51.988
Oh, my God.
It's really happening.

40:52.241 --> 40:53.697
Mmm-hmm. Are we
watching Dirty Dancing?

40:53.785 --> 40:54.866
Should we start with
a round of "I Never"?

40:54.953 --> 40:56.819
Doesn't matter to me.
Just choose fast.

40:56.913 --> 40:57.948
I go to bed early,

40:58.039 --> 41:00.406
and I'll have to pee 10
times between now and then,

41:00.500 --> 41:01.990
including in
about five seconds.

41:02.126 --> 41:04.163
Go! DONNA: It's
your call, Louis.

41:04.754 --> 41:06.461
Because tonight,

41:06.589 --> 41:09.206
you are the most important
woman in the room.

41:10.218 --> 41:12.801
Donna, that is the nicest
thing you've ever said to me.

41:14.430 --> 41:16.012
Dirty Dancing it is.

41:16.891 --> 41:19.007
Faye, funny running
into you.

41:19.686 --> 41:21.927
You appear to be
in fine spirits.

41:22.021 --> 41:24.809
That's because someone
recently reminded me

41:24.983 --> 41:26.724
I'm the guy
it always works out for.

41:27.944 --> 41:29.605
Your modesty is astounding.

41:29.696 --> 41:32.358
It isn't about modesty.
It's about character.

41:32.573 --> 41:35.406
You see, Faye, the reason
things always work out for me

41:35.493 --> 41:37.700
isn't that I sometimes
cross lines.

41:38.079 --> 41:40.286
It's the relationship
I have with people.

41:41.416 --> 41:42.656
What did you do?

41:43.042 --> 41:45.454
I went to Kevin Miller.
He's an old friend of mine.

41:45.545 --> 41:48.913
I told him he'd be a fool to pass
up an opportunity to buy SensaTech.

41:49.298 --> 41:51.665
I also told him he'd be
a fool not to hire back

41:51.759 --> 41:53.875
the man that built that
company from scratch.

41:54.095 --> 41:57.338
And what exactly did you do for
Mr. Miller to become his friend?

41:57.432 --> 41:58.763
I got him out of a jam,

41:58.891 --> 42:01.098
like the way I'm willing
to let you out of one.

42:01.769 --> 42:02.759
Excuse me?

42:02.854 --> 42:05.016
Johnson and Powell
remain SensaTech's counsel.

42:05.106 --> 42:06.847
You save face,
and all you have to do

42:06.941 --> 42:08.352
is give Gretchen
back to Louis.

42:08.443 --> 42:09.433
I don't believe it.

42:09.527 --> 42:11.814
You're leveraging a client
for your own purposes.

42:11.904 --> 42:14.692
My client is fine with it.
I came through for him.

42:14.782 --> 42:17.570
Well, I'm not fine with it,
and I don't play by your rules.

42:17.660 --> 42:19.901
And what if Gretchen
isn't fine working for you?

42:19.996 --> 42:21.361
I told him
it was temporary,

42:21.456 --> 42:23.413
but if you think you're
going to extort me

42:23.499 --> 42:24.785
into getting her
back early,

42:24.876 --> 42:26.082
you can hand in your
resignation. (ELEVATOR DINGS)

42:27.170 --> 42:29.878
This isn't your firm, Faye.
It's mine.

42:30.048 --> 42:31.584
And I'm not going anywhere.

42:31.674 --> 42:32.914
And neither am I.

42:33.009 --> 42:35.341
And for the record, you said
you'd do anything to win this,

42:35.428 --> 42:37.260
but you haven't crossed
a single line.

42:37.346 --> 42:39.132
So as far as I'm concerned,

42:39.223 --> 42:40.509
I'm doing my job.
