WEBVTT

00:02.802 --> 00:05.303
Have you guys seen this feature
that lets you talk to Siri

00:05.305 --> 00:07.038
without pressing
any buttons?

00:07.040 --> 00:08.473
No. How does it work?

00:08.475 --> 00:11.910
You just say, uh, “Hey,
Siri, what time is it?”

00:11.912 --> 00:14.179
The time is 6:37 p.m.

00:14.181 --> 00:15.380
Yeah.

00:15.382 --> 00:17.615
So now anyone
can control your phone?

00:17.617 --> 00:20.852
Hey, Siri, show me pictures
of naked grandma butts.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.587
Nice try.

00:22.589 --> 00:25.790
It only recognizes <i>my</i> voice.
Oh. Cool.

00:25.792 --> 00:28.860
Hey, Siri, show me
pictures of naked grandma butts.

00:28.862 --> 00:31.863
I don't sound
like that.

00:31.865 --> 00:35.733
Here are some images
of naked grandma butts.

00:35.735 --> 00:38.136
Hey. Good news,
everybody.

00:38.138 --> 00:40.405
Now that I'm no longer
with Amy,

00:40.407 --> 00:43.341
I have an extra ticket to the
annual Thanksgiving lunch buffet

00:43.343 --> 00:46.010
at the aquarium cafeteria.
Who wants it?

00:48.580 --> 00:50.548
Well, you realize
you won't be going alone--

00:50.550 --> 00:52.216
I'll be there the whole time.

00:53.452 --> 00:56.020
Providing
fish and pilgrim facts.

00:57.456 --> 01:00.024
Can you people hear me?

01:00.026 --> 01:01.792
Well, we're having
everyone over.

01:01.794 --> 01:03.561
Yeah, Leonard and I
are gonna be cooking

01:03.563 --> 01:05.963
all day.
Otherwise we'd <i> love</i> to.

01:05.965 --> 01:07.131
But we can't.

01:07.133 --> 01:09.066
Yeah, poor us.
Mm-hmm.

01:11.536 --> 01:13.104
And Raj and I
are volunteering

01:13.106 --> 01:15.439
at the soup kitchen,
feeding food to the homeless.

01:15.441 --> 01:17.608
Well, Howard,
what about you?

01:17.610 --> 01:18.843
Oh...

01:18.845 --> 01:21.745
I can't. I'm going
to the soup kitchen, too.

01:21.747 --> 01:25.482
You said that sounded like
the worst thing ever.

01:26.985 --> 01:28.986
If you can't support me
when I'm lying,

01:28.988 --> 01:31.789
why are we married?

02:03.099 --> 02:05.532
Hi, Sheldon. What's?
Well, I'm calling

02:05.534 --> 02:07.734
because Thanksgiving
is coming up,

02:07.736 --> 02:11.305
and I wanted to offer you
the aquarium tickets.

02:11.307 --> 02:12.739
No one can go with you?

02:12.741 --> 02:15.142
No. They'd rather spend
the holiday with each other

02:15.144 --> 02:18.779
than find out of this is the
year I finally touch a starfish.

02:18.781 --> 02:20.480
Anyway,
I wouldn't want

02:20.482 --> 02:24.451
the tickets to go to waste,
so take whomever you'd like.

02:24.453 --> 02:26.019
Oh.

02:26.021 --> 02:28.922
Okay. Thank you.
And feel free

02:28.924 --> 02:31.558
to tell your guest
that the Myanmar catfish

02:31.560 --> 02:33.927
is also known
as the pilgrim fish.

02:33.929 --> 02:38.798
In case the turkey's dry
and you need something juicy.

02:38.800 --> 02:41.368
Sheldon...
I can tell you want to go,

02:41.370 --> 02:43.870
so if you'd be comfortable
with it,

02:43.872 --> 02:46.339
maybe we could go as friends.

02:46.341 --> 02:48.608
You don't think
that will be awkward?

02:48.610 --> 02:51.444
Well... it <i> is</i> Thanksgiving
in an aquarium cafeteria,

02:51.446 --> 02:54.481
so I'm gonna go out
on a limb here and say yes.

02:55.950 --> 02:57.984
But if you mean between <i> us...</i>

02:57.986 --> 02:59.886
I think it'll be fine.

03:00.939 --> 03:02.539
Very well, then.

03:02.607 --> 03:04.875
I'll see you
on Thanksgiving morning.

03:04.943 --> 03:06.677
See you then.
Oh,

03:06.745 --> 03:09.146
and forget what I said
about the Myanmar catfish.

03:09.214 --> 03:12.549
My list of marine-themed
pilgrim facts is pretty short.

03:12.617 --> 03:14.752
Did you know they served
shellfish and eel

03:14.819 --> 03:16.059
at the very first Thanksgiving?

03:16.087 --> 03:18.489
And there goes my list.

03:21.092 --> 03:23.160
So, how does this work?

03:23.228 --> 03:25.629
The soup kitchen manager
assigns the jobs,

03:25.697 --> 03:27.598
and the shifts
are six hours.

03:27.665 --> 03:28.732
Six hours?

03:28.800 --> 03:32.236
Oh, God, I don't want to
complain for that long.

03:33.204 --> 03:35.606
Do you ever do anything
for anyone else?

03:35.673 --> 03:41.211
I happen to be
a giving and generous lover.

03:41.279 --> 03:44.448
Are you and I close enough
for me to say that's creepy?

03:44.516 --> 03:48.552
We are, and I believe the word
you're looking for is... yech!

03:49.754 --> 03:51.188
Uh, can I help you?

03:51.256 --> 03:53.023
Hi. We'd like to volunteer.

03:53.091 --> 03:54.792
Oh, I appreciate
you guys coming down,

03:54.859 --> 03:56.193
but we already have
enough people.

03:56.261 --> 03:57.961
Any other day,
please, come back.

03:58.029 --> 03:59.963
Oh. Okay.

04:04.436 --> 04:07.204
Wipe that smug smile
off your face.

04:07.272 --> 04:10.140
Maybe I'm happy
that so many people turned up

04:10.208 --> 04:12.409
to help the less fortunate.

04:13.812 --> 04:15.746
Are you and I close
enough for me to say...

04:15.814 --> 04:17.680
That he's an ass?
He beat you to it.

04:18.983 --> 04:20.983
I was wrong.
A large group had to cancel.

04:21.052 --> 04:23.220
Oh, great.
We'd love to help.

04:24.889 --> 04:27.257
Wipe that smug smile
off your face.

04:28.059 --> 04:31.628
I can't!

04:32.931 --> 04:33.964
Look at us!

04:34.032 --> 04:36.066
Our first Thanksgiving
as husband and wife.

04:36.134 --> 04:37.234
I know.

04:37.302 --> 04:38.402
I feel so grown up.

04:38.470 --> 04:40.737
Sweetie, you <i>are</i> grown up.
Really?

04:40.805 --> 04:44.808
How many grown-ups do you know
who have Mr. Spock oven mitts?

04:44.876 --> 04:47.044
Hey, the recipes
are on my iPad.

04:47.112 --> 04:48.812
Will you pull 'em up?
Yep.

04:48.880 --> 04:51.815
What's the code?
My birthday.

04:51.883 --> 04:53.517
It's not working.

04:53.585 --> 04:56.086
It's just the four digits--
month and day.

04:57.789 --> 04:58.989
Nope.

04:59.057 --> 05:01.258
Let me see.

05:03.628 --> 05:05.262
Yeah, there.

05:09.968 --> 05:12.536
What number were
<i>you</i> putting in?

05:13.938 --> 05:15.672
Uh...

05:16.941 --> 05:18.976
You don't know my
birthday, do you?

05:19.043 --> 05:21.745
Yes, I do.
Well, what is it?

05:21.813 --> 05:23.881
May.

05:23.948 --> 05:26.316
May what?

05:26.384 --> 05:28.919
I'm not gonna say
your password out loud.

05:28.987 --> 05:31.288
That is not secure.

05:31.356 --> 05:33.058
You don't know your own
husband's birthday.

05:33.082 --> 05:34.625
Well...

05:34.626 --> 05:36.126
you don't know everything
about <i>me.</i>

05:36.194 --> 05:37.261
Your birthday is December 2,

05:37.328 --> 05:38.862
you grew up on
Perkins Street,

05:38.930 --> 05:40.831
the last four digits
of your social are

05:40.899 --> 05:42.166
7-6-2-1,

05:42.233 --> 05:46.036
and the odds of me letting
you forget this are zero.

05:46.104 --> 05:48.372
Oh, look at us.

05:48.439 --> 05:51.408
Our last Thanksgiving
as husband and wife.

05:54.312 --> 05:55.679
Hello.

05:55.747 --> 05:57.047
Hi.

05:57.115 --> 05:58.815
Ready for the
aquarium?

05:58.883 --> 06:02.319
I am. You know, and in an effort
to reduce awkwardness

06:02.387 --> 06:05.989
as we learn how to function as friends,
I printed out a list

06:06.057 --> 06:09.593
of safe topics
for polite conversation.

06:09.661 --> 06:12.462
If that makes you
more comfortable.

06:12.530 --> 06:15.599
If there were a list of things
that make me more comfortable,

06:15.667 --> 06:18.068
lists would be
on the top of that list.

06:18.136 --> 06:20.871
Okay, now... Oh.

06:20.939 --> 06:24.408
"Since last we spoke,
have you acquired any pets?"

06:24.475 --> 06:25.943
No. You?

06:26.010 --> 06:28.045
No.

06:29.414 --> 06:32.216
Um, "Since last we spoke,
have you planned

06:32.283 --> 06:34.284
or gone on any vacations?"

06:34.352 --> 06:36.687
I might go visit my aunt
next week.

06:36.754 --> 06:38.288
Mm. Your aunt
in Modesto?

06:38.356 --> 06:40.057
No, the one in
Bakersfield.

06:40.124 --> 06:42.259
Bakersfield. I see.

06:42.327 --> 06:45.128
Where has this list been
all my life?

06:47.498 --> 06:49.333
We're gonna have you
washing dishes.

06:49.400 --> 06:52.569
Uh, aprons and rubber gloves
are here-- just...

06:52.637 --> 06:53.670
scrape, wash and stack.

06:53.738 --> 06:55.239
If you need me, I'll be around.

06:55.306 --> 06:59.109
So we don't even get to be up front
where the action is?

06:59.177 --> 07:00.577
What difference
does it make?

07:00.645 --> 07:02.846
I don't know.
I was hoping some poor kid

07:02.914 --> 07:04.314
would come up to me and say,

07:04.382 --> 07:07.451
Please, sir, I want some more.

07:09.187 --> 07:11.688
You're in a soup kitchen,

07:11.756 --> 07:14.391
not a production
of <i>Oliver!</i>

07:14.459 --> 07:17.961
It's not like
I'm expecting them to sing.

07:20.898 --> 07:23.000
...and then the next day
was 73 degrees,

07:23.067 --> 07:25.002
and the day after that
was 72,

07:25.069 --> 07:26.803
and then it was
72 again...

07:26.871 --> 07:28.405
uh, then it was 74,

07:28.473 --> 07:30.507
and that brings us
to today, at--

07:30.575 --> 07:34.244
I'd wear shorts
if I had a pair-- 78.

07:34.312 --> 07:36.980
Are we done discussing
the weather?

07:37.048 --> 07:38.982
I don't know if
I'd call it "discussing."

07:39.050 --> 07:41.852
You kind of sat back
and let me do all the work.

07:41.919 --> 07:43.754
Let's see

07:43.821 --> 07:45.022
what's next on the list.

07:45.089 --> 07:46.823
Oh, here.
Uh, "Do you whittle,

07:46.891 --> 07:48.759
"and if so, what kind of knife

07:48.826 --> 07:50.327
do you..."
Sheldon.

07:50.395 --> 07:53.030
We've known each other
a long time.

07:53.097 --> 07:55.699
We are perfectly capable
of having a conversation

07:55.767 --> 07:58.902
without relying on a list
off the Internet.

07:59.704 --> 08:00.871
All right.

08:00.938 --> 08:02.572
Well, what should
we talk about?

08:02.640 --> 08:05.876
I don't know. Just ask me
whatever comes to mind.

08:05.943 --> 08:08.445
Very well.

08:08.513 --> 08:11.448
I know you've been
seeing other men.

08:11.516 --> 08:15.585
Have you had coitus
with any of them?

08:15.653 --> 08:18.522
Man, I walked
right into that one.

08:21.059 --> 08:24.961
Next we need a
teaspoon of pepper,

08:25.029 --> 08:29.700
which, I  believe, was also
the name of your childhood dog.

08:30.868 --> 08:33.904
Fine. You think
you know so much.

08:33.971 --> 08:36.039
Who's my favorite
Spice Girl?

08:36.107 --> 08:37.607
Baby.
Who's my favorite member of NSYNC?

08:37.674 --> 08:39.208
Justin.
Who's my favorite Backstreet Boy?

08:39.277 --> 08:41.812
Nice try. NSYNC forever.
Damn it!

08:41.879 --> 08:43.714
Face it,

08:43.780 --> 08:46.083
you can't stump me--
I am the king of husbands.

08:46.150 --> 08:47.851
I know that you
don't like the lingerie

08:47.919 --> 08:49.286
that I got you
on Valentine's Day.

08:49.354 --> 08:52.322
I know you hate the word "moist." I know...
Hang on.

08:52.390 --> 08:54.825
Wait, wait. Why don't I like
the lingerie you got me?

08:54.892 --> 08:55.887
Because it's orange

08:55.911 --> 08:58.190
and you think it makes you
look like a slutty carrot.

09:01.299 --> 09:02.632
Interesting.

09:02.700 --> 09:03.900
I never told you that.

09:03.968 --> 09:04.968
Sure you did.
No.

09:05.036 --> 09:07.104
I never told anyone that.

09:07.171 --> 09:10.107
But I did write it
in my journal.

09:11.242 --> 09:13.443
<i>What?</i>

09:15.513 --> 09:18.448
I didn't know you had a journal.

09:18.516 --> 09:22.986
I also know your voice
gets higher when you're lying.

09:23.054 --> 09:25.622
No, it doesn't.

09:27.000 --> 09:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:34.691 --> 09:37.164
You know, this reminds me
of high school.

09:37.165 --> 09:38.732
You worked in
a restaurant?

09:38.800 --> 09:43.270
No, I was in India--
it was humid and smelled funny.

09:43.338 --> 09:45.973
All right, I think
I'm getting into a groove here.

09:46.040 --> 09:47.407
This isn't so bad.

09:47.475 --> 09:49.643
Only five hours
and 40 minutes to go.

09:49.711 --> 09:52.279
We've only been
doing this 20 minutes?!

09:53.014 --> 09:54.815
You know, I read that

09:54.882 --> 09:57.517
washing dishes can be an
excellent form of meditation.

09:57.585 --> 09:59.686
The key is that while
washing the dishes

09:59.754 --> 10:04.124
one should only be...
washing the dishes.

10:05.159 --> 10:06.727
Just because you
have that accent

10:06.794 --> 10:09.696
doesn't mean what
you say isn't stupid.

10:09.764 --> 10:11.498
No, seriously.

10:11.566 --> 10:13.700
It's about being present
in the moment,

10:13.768 --> 10:16.837
focusing on the feeling
of the warm water,

10:16.904 --> 10:18.705
the smell of
the detergent,

10:18.773 --> 10:22.442
the sound of the dishes squeaking,
and following your own breath.

10:22.510 --> 10:25.912
It's about... it's
about simply being.

10:25.980 --> 10:27.814
Ah.

10:27.882 --> 10:30.183
Okay..I'll try  t.

10:35.790 --> 10:37.124
I need three people
out front.

10:37.191 --> 10:39.793
I'll do it!
Me! Right here!

10:39.861 --> 10:43.330
No fair! I was meditating!

10:45.400 --> 10:46.600
Come on,
don't be mad.

10:46.667 --> 10:48.507
It was a long time ago,
and it was an accident.

10:48.569 --> 10:51.171
How can reading my journal
be an accident?

10:51.239 --> 10:52.305
I didn't even
know what it was.

10:52.373 --> 10:54.508
I saw it on your nightstand.
I picked it up.

10:54.575 --> 10:56.443
Well, when you realized what
it was, why didn't you stop?

10:56.511 --> 10:58.845
You know me, I'm a
big ol' bookworm.

11:00.782 --> 11:02.222
All right.
Let's just finish cooking.

11:02.250 --> 11:05.185
Well... Hey. O-Okay.
Let me make this up to you.

11:05.253 --> 11:06.887
Sometimes I keep
an online journal.

11:06.954 --> 11:08.622
I want you to read
something that I write.

11:08.689 --> 11:10.524
Okay, really, I'm fine.
Okay.

11:10.591 --> 11:12.159
Well, then I'll read it to you.

11:12.226 --> 11:14.661
It's from the day we first met.

11:16.531 --> 11:19.800
"Beauty, thy name is Penny."
Oh, God.

11:19.867 --> 11:21.568
Stop.

11:21.636 --> 11:22.803
I don't want you

11:22.870 --> 11:24.271
to read something
you think'll just butter me up.

11:24.338 --> 11:26.606
I want to hear
the most recent thing you wrote.

11:26.674 --> 11:28.442
Fine.

11:28.509 --> 11:29.776
Mmm...

11:32.480 --> 11:35.515
"Penny's beauty,
like our love,

11:35.583 --> 11:38.852
grows more with
each passing day."

11:38.920 --> 11:39.986
Does it really say that?

11:40.054 --> 11:44.124
Why would I lie?

11:44.192 --> 11:47.360
"OMG. OMG.

11:47.428 --> 11:49.296
"We're so close
to the new <i>Star Wars.</i>

11:49.363 --> 11:51.465
"I can't take it.

11:51.532 --> 11:53.500
Gah."

11:53.568 --> 11:54.568
"Gah"?

11:54.635 --> 11:57.270
Well, you didn't
read it right.

11:57.338 --> 12:00.807
The new <i>Star Wars</i>
is coming. Gah!

12:06.080 --> 12:09.015
I'm sensing things
have gotten awkward.

12:09.083 --> 12:11.418
No. It's okay.

12:11.486 --> 12:14.754
If we're friends, we should be
able to talk about anything.

12:14.822 --> 12:16.656
All right.

12:16.724 --> 12:20.760
So, you had some questions
about me seeing other people.

12:20.828 --> 12:22.629
Just a few.

12:22.697 --> 12:24.431
Go ahead.

12:24.499 --> 12:26.433
How many dates have you been on?

12:26.501 --> 12:28.435
Who were they with?
Where'd you go?

12:28.503 --> 12:30.904
Where did you meet them?
Did you sleep with them?

12:30.972 --> 12:32.772
And how much longer
to the aquarium?

12:32.840 --> 12:35.175
I'm getting kind of hungry.

12:35.243 --> 12:37.577
Let's see.

12:37.645 --> 12:41.448
I have been on six dates
with three different people.

12:41.516 --> 12:44.284
It was either for
coffee or dinner.

12:44.352 --> 12:47.787
One I met at a bookstore
and two I met online.

12:47.855 --> 12:49.589
I haven't slept with anyone.

12:49.657 --> 12:51.324
The aquarium is
40 minutes away.

12:51.392 --> 12:53.160
And there's a baggie of Cheerios
for you

12:53.227 --> 12:54.494
in the glove compartment.

12:54.562 --> 12:57.831
Uh, regular or honey nut?

12:57.899 --> 13:00.167
I mixed them.

13:00.234 --> 13:02.435
You mixed them.
No wonder gentleman callers

13:02.503 --> 13:04.604
are pounding down your door.

13:07.008 --> 13:09.276
Do you have any questions
for me?

13:10.845 --> 13:12.779
Just one.

13:12.847 --> 13:15.749
Are you doing okay?

13:16.784 --> 13:19.719
I am.

13:19.787 --> 13:21.354
Good.

13:21.422 --> 13:24.591
I-I want you to be happy.

13:24.659 --> 13:26.760
I believe you.

13:29.830 --> 13:33.633
I'd believe you more if you
threw a few Apple Jacks in here.

13:37.205 --> 13:40.240
Here you go.
Thanks.

13:40.308 --> 13:42.075
You got to be kidding me.

13:42.143 --> 13:43.710
Sorry?

13:43.778 --> 13:46.580
Y-You're Elon Musk.

13:46.647 --> 13:47.647
I am.

13:52.320 --> 13:55.255
Wh-What are you doing here?

13:55.323 --> 13:57.490
I'm washing dishes.

13:57.558 --> 13:58.692
Well,

13:58.759 --> 14:00.393
I was on the turkey line,
but I got demoted

14:00.461 --> 14:02.829
for being too generous
with the gravy.

14:05.099 --> 14:07.033
Oh, man. I...

14:07.101 --> 14:08.568
What an honor to meet you.

14:08.636 --> 14:13.306
I'm-I'm such a fan
of Tesla and SpaceX.

14:13.374 --> 14:15.008
All your companies.

14:15.076 --> 14:16.943
Howard Wolowitz, Caltech.

14:17.011 --> 14:19.412
Nice to meet you, Howard.
Feels great to come down here

14:19.480 --> 14:21.114
and help the less fortunate,
huh?

14:21.182 --> 14:23.083
Oh, yeah.

14:24.118 --> 14:28.288
Nothing better
than helping people.

14:29.223 --> 14:32.626
Which is something I realized

14:32.693 --> 14:34.461
when I was viewing Earth

14:34.528 --> 14:37.697
from the deck of
the International Space Station,

14:37.765 --> 14:41.434
where I spent two months as
a payload specialist, a job

14:41.502 --> 14:47.140
I was qualified for because
I'm an MIT-trained engineer.

14:47.208 --> 14:50.176
And I thought
I ladled the gravy on thick.

14:50.244 --> 14:52.412
Sorry. It's just...

14:52.480 --> 14:53.780
you're you, you know?

14:53.848 --> 14:57.951
And I really want you
to adopt me.

14:58.019 --> 14:59.386
Well, you're here
on Thanksgiving,

14:59.453 --> 15:00.487
so you're probably
a good person.

15:00.554 --> 15:04.190
Oh. I made my wife come down,
too.

15:04.258 --> 15:07.427
You think you might
ever get back out to space?

15:07.495 --> 15:11.331
Is that a job offer? 'Cause
I really want to go to Mars.

15:11.399 --> 15:12.365
Assuming I can
bring my wife.

15:12.433 --> 15:13.933
She hardly takes up any room.

15:14.001 --> 15:16.836
She's basically a carry-on.

15:16.904 --> 15:18.471
Well, we're not quite there yet,

15:18.539 --> 15:20.240
but we're always looking
for engineers.

15:20.308 --> 15:22.075
So let me give you my e-mail.
We can stay in touch.

15:22.143 --> 15:23.677
Thank you.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.213
Oh, look.

15:27.281 --> 15:28.815
Someone hardly touched
their pumpkin pie.

15:28.883 --> 15:32.218
Want to share it with me?

15:32.286 --> 15:36.222
A-a partially eaten piece
of pumpkin pie

15:36.290 --> 15:37.957
from a homeless shelter?

15:38.025 --> 15:40.093
With Elon Musk, you bet I do!

15:45.032 --> 15:47.734
You know, for a
Thanksgiving buffet

15:47.802 --> 15:51.738
in an aquarium cafeteria,
that was really bad.

15:51.806 --> 15:54.474
You're just upset 'cause
they ran out of Pilgrim hats.

15:54.542 --> 15:57.877
They gave one to that baby.
He wasn't even awake.

15:57.945 --> 16:02.716
Well, it wouldn't be a holiday
without you being mad at a baby.

16:02.783 --> 16:04.250
Oh.

16:04.318 --> 16:07.954
Would you care to play
an ocean-themed game I invented?

16:08.022 --> 16:09.089
Sure. What is it?

16:09.156 --> 16:11.358
It's called Food, Friend, Fight.

16:11.425 --> 16:13.727
One of us chooses
three aquatic creatures,

16:13.794 --> 16:16.262
and the other one must decide
which he would eat,

16:16.330 --> 16:18.998
befriend, or battle.

16:19.066 --> 16:21.634
So it's like Kiss, Marry, Kill.

16:21.702 --> 16:22.769
What is that?

16:22.837 --> 16:24.671
It's a game
where you're given three people

16:24.739 --> 16:27.440
and you choose which one
you'd kiss, marry, or kill.

16:27.508 --> 16:30.143
Well, my game is better, 'cause
instead of marrying someone,

16:30.211 --> 16:32.879
you get to eat them.

16:32.947 --> 16:34.147
Let's just play.

16:34.215 --> 16:35.749
I'll start
you off easy.

16:35.816 --> 16:40.487
Electric eel,
pufferfish, shrimp.

16:40.554 --> 16:43.156
Hmm. Well,

16:43.224 --> 16:44.691
I wouldn't fight the eel,
because I know

16:44.759 --> 16:47.193
it can generate enough current
to kill a horse.

16:47.261 --> 16:48.828
So I'd eat
the eel,

16:48.896 --> 16:52.031
fight the shrimp,
and befriend the pufferfish,

16:52.099 --> 16:53.433
because it would be nice
to have company

16:53.501 --> 16:55.568
on those days I feel bloated.

16:56.604 --> 16:58.071
Very well done.

16:58.139 --> 16:59.072
Thank you.

16:59.140 --> 17:00.774
Okay, your turn.

17:00.841 --> 17:03.042
Hmm. Seal,

17:03.110 --> 17:05.178
hagfish...

17:05.246 --> 17:08.348
SpongeBob SquarePants.

17:08.415 --> 17:11.184
Well, I'd befriend SpongeBob
but he's not real,

17:11.252 --> 17:12.585
so I can't do that, can I?

17:12.653 --> 17:15.221
But you can pal around
with a hagfish?

17:15.289 --> 17:18.223
Hey, let's not pull
at that thread.

17:18.291 --> 17:20.126
Okay. I'll
fight SpongeBob,

17:20.194 --> 17:23.930
because he's so friendly we'll
just end up tickling each other.

17:23.998 --> 17:25.732
Um, I'll befriend the seal,

17:25.800 --> 17:27.534
because he's trainable,
which is the problem

17:27.601 --> 17:29.202
I'm having with my
current friends.

17:29.270 --> 17:33.206
Which means I'll have
to eat the hagfish.

17:33.274 --> 17:35.875
Isn't that gross?
I mean, a hagfish can produce

17:35.943 --> 17:38.445
enough mucus to fill a bucket
in a minute.

17:38.512 --> 17:42.148
I know. It makes its own gravy--
it'll slide right down.

17:46.754 --> 17:50.757
I miss this.

17:50.825 --> 17:54.461
How can you miss a game you've
never played before, silly?

17:56.851 --> 17:58.731
I guess sometimes I'm silly.

18:01.968 --> 18:05.237
Hey. Where'd you go? I can't
tell if the turkey's done!

18:05.304 --> 18:07.305
Be right there!

18:13.579 --> 18:15.313
Hi, lover.

18:17.984 --> 18:21.553
What are you doing?

18:21.621 --> 18:23.555
I'm sorry about the journal.
I want to make it up to you.

18:23.623 --> 18:29.027
So I'm gonna let you post
a shame photo of me on Facebook.

18:30.363 --> 18:33.031
I am not putting
that on the Internet!

18:33.099 --> 18:34.533
I don't want
people to see this.

18:34.600 --> 18:37.235
I don't want to see it!

18:37.303 --> 18:39.704
Don't want people
to see what, huh?

18:39.772 --> 18:42.974
A little bit of this?
Oh...

18:43.976 --> 18:45.277
Huh?

18:46.612 --> 18:48.947
Some of this?

18:50.750 --> 18:52.584
And, since it's Thanksgiving,

18:52.652 --> 18:56.388
an extra helping of this?

18:56.455 --> 18:58.356
Happy Thanks... Yikes.

19:09.698 --> 19:11.532
I'm glad you had a
nice time with Amy.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.668
Me, too. It's comforting to know

19:13.735 --> 19:16.270
that she and I are able
to function as friends.

19:16.338 --> 19:18.606
Well, I've never been
friends with any of my exes.

19:18.674 --> 19:21.509
Oh, I'm sure you and Leonard
will be able to pull it off.

19:24.313 --> 19:27.648
Oh. It's my friend Amy.

19:27.716 --> 19:29.216
Hello.

19:29.284 --> 19:30.351
Hi, Sheldon.

19:30.419 --> 19:31.852
I'm just driving home
from my mother's.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.788
Did you have a nice time?

19:33.855 --> 19:36.190
I did. Um...

19:36.258 --> 19:40.928
listen, I really enjoyed
spending this morning with you.

19:40.996 --> 19:42.930
Well, I can't take
all the credit.

19:42.998 --> 19:44.932
It was pretty funny
when that one anchovy

19:45.000 --> 19:47.935
started going the wrong way.

19:48.003 --> 19:50.404
It was.

19:50.472 --> 19:52.940
Uh, listen,

19:53.008 --> 19:55.710
I-I was thinking that, um,

19:55.777 --> 20:00.181
maybe I'm ready
to be your girlfriend again.

20:00.248 --> 20:02.683
Oh.

20:02.751 --> 20:05.519
I thought we were just friends.

20:05.587 --> 20:06.654
We are.

20:06.722 --> 20:09.323
But I was hoping,

20:09.391 --> 20:11.292
maybe...
Amy,

20:11.360 --> 20:13.094
I excel at many things,

20:13.161 --> 20:16.030
but getting over you
wasn't one of them.

20:17.299 --> 20:20.935
I think I need
to just be your friend.

20:21.770 --> 20:24.271
Okay.

20:24.339 --> 20:26.273
I understand.

20:28.343 --> 20:29.810
Good.

20:29.878 --> 20:31.112
Oh, I watched a video

20:31.179 --> 20:33.114
of the hagfish producing mucus,

20:33.181 --> 20:36.751
so I'm gonna change my answer
and eat SpongeBob.

20:36.818 --> 20:39.020
Okay. Sure.
