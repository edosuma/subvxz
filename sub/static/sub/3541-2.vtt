<i>Previously on</i> The Vampire Diaries:

00:03.820 --> 00:06.380
For over a century,
I have lived in secret. Until now.

00:06.556 --> 00:08.490
I know the risk,
but I have to know her.

00:08.658 --> 00:11.024
- What are you?
- I'm a vampire.

00:11.194 --> 00:12.718
- That noise.
- What noise?

00:12.896 --> 00:15.387
- Aah!
- Tyler!

00:15.565 --> 00:16.793
What the hell?

00:18.334 --> 00:20.268
- Caroline!
- I can give Caroline some blood.

00:20.437 --> 00:21.563
No. No way.

00:21.738 --> 00:22.762
- Enough to heal.
- Do it.

00:22.939 --> 00:24.804
- So the black sheep returns.
- Tyler?

00:24.974 --> 00:26.339
Who's the guy with Carol?

00:26.509 --> 00:28.409
Mayor's younger brother,
Mason Lockwood.

00:28.578 --> 00:31.911
Damon. Damon, I care about you.
I do. But I love Stefan.

00:32.082 --> 00:36.018
- Elena, what's going on in here?
- No! Damon! Damon!

00:36.186 --> 00:38.154
No, no, no.

00:40.223 --> 00:42.691
- Why do I look like Katherine?
- You are not Katherine.

00:42.859 --> 00:44.850
You're the opposite
of everything she was.

00:45.028 --> 00:47.724
- Elena, what are you doing here?
- My name is Katherine.

00:47.897 --> 00:51.765
I was hoping you could give the Salvatore
brothers a message for me. Game on.

00:51.935 --> 00:53.163
What?

01:11.087 --> 01:14.250
Excuse me. Where is everyone?

01:14.924 --> 01:17.358
- It's the middle of the night, hon.
- It is?

01:17.560 --> 01:20.791
- Mm-hm.
- Well, have you seen my mom?

01:20.964 --> 01:23.023
She left after dinner
with your boyfriend.

01:23.566 --> 01:26.364
- And then your friend Elena stopped by.
- She did?

01:28.772 --> 01:30.899
Yeah, she did.

01:31.074 --> 01:32.871
But she said
her name was Katherine.

01:35.345 --> 01:38.712
- Can I just get something to eat?
- Breakfast comes around 7:00.

01:38.882 --> 01:41.407
- But I'm hungry.
- You should go back to sleep.

01:49.492 --> 01:51.858
- What is that smell?
- Back to bed.

02:25.662 --> 02:27.186
What are you doing in here?

02:28.298 --> 02:29.424
I don't know.

02:29.599 --> 02:31.897
You need to get back to bed.

03:36.232 --> 03:37.961
Need another hand over here.

03:42.872 --> 03:45.932
I mean, Katherine looked just like you.
It was freakish.

03:46.109 --> 03:48.100
She is my ancestor.

03:48.278 --> 03:50.576
I moved the student booths
into the cafeteria.

03:50.747 --> 03:52.078
Your vampire ancestor.

03:52.248 --> 03:54.216
And she didn't just resemble you...

03:54.384 --> 03:57.080
...like a family member would.
She was you.

03:57.253 --> 04:01.019
I don't know. I can't explain it, okay?
It's creepy. That's all I got.

04:01.190 --> 04:03.920
How do you know she's not out there
pretending to be you.

04:04.093 --> 04:07.756
I don't. But I could sit here
and be tortured by the not knowing...

04:07.931 --> 04:10.525
...or I could get these prizes
to the ring toss.

04:10.700 --> 04:13.294
Have you talked to Damon
since he killed Jeremy?

04:13.503 --> 04:16.870
- Or tried to kill Jeremy?
- No, Bonnie, I haven't.

04:17.040 --> 04:20.874
I won't and I don't wanna talk about
Damon or anything vampire-related.

04:22.278 --> 04:23.302
Copy that.

04:25.081 --> 04:27.106
I'm human.

04:27.283 --> 04:30.116
And I have to do human stuff,
otherwise I'm gonna go crazy.

04:30.286 --> 04:32.914
Okay. I'm sorry, I'll focus.

04:33.089 --> 04:36.286
We have to make Caroline proud.
Or she will kill us.

04:36.459 --> 04:40.759
- I don't know how she does this.
- Because she's not human, obviously.

04:40.930 --> 04:42.921
Obviously, heh.

04:43.099 --> 04:45.533
It's the same as the bracelet
Elena gave you.

04:46.169 --> 04:50.663
- So it protects me from compulsion?
- Vervain is toxic to vampires.

04:51.407 --> 04:52.499
You mean, like, poison?

04:52.675 --> 04:55.576
Yeah. It's very poisonous.
It'll keep them out of your head.

04:55.745 --> 04:57.144
But why vervain?

04:57.313 --> 05:01.909
I don't know. There's certain natural
herbs and roots and other elements...

05:02.085 --> 05:03.780
...that are harmful to vampires.

05:03.953 --> 05:06.945
- Like a stake through the heart?
- Right, but it has to be wood.

05:07.123 --> 05:08.613
You're pretty confident...

05:08.791 --> 05:11.624
...telling me all the different ways
I could kill you.

05:11.794 --> 05:15.457
If I thought you wanted to kill me,
we'd be having a different conversation.

05:16.599 --> 05:18.567
And Damon is the one that deserves it.

05:20.136 --> 05:21.763
I want you to forget about Damon.

05:21.938 --> 05:24.372
He's a hundred times
stronger than you...

05:24.574 --> 05:27.441
...and he's not stable.
You gotta try to move forward.

05:27.610 --> 05:30.443
I was killed by a vampire
and brought back by a magic ring.

05:30.613 --> 05:32.376
How do you move forward from that?

05:32.582 --> 05:35.949
Today, we have a nice distraction
courtesy of the slave driver Elena.

05:36.119 --> 05:38.679
- Hello, Elena.
- Hey, um, Jeremy...

05:38.855 --> 05:41.551
Yeah, yeah, I set up the goldfish toss.
All 300 goldfish.

05:41.724 --> 05:42.816
It's gonna be epic.

05:48.398 --> 05:49.865
Yeah. He's gonna be all right.

05:50.033 --> 05:54.231
He's just been through
a little bit of an ordeal.

05:54.404 --> 05:56.429
I was hoping this carnival
would reel him back...

05:56.606 --> 05:58.972
...into the land of high school teenager.

05:59.142 --> 06:01.872
- Oh, is that what we're doing here?
- Yes, we all are.

06:02.045 --> 06:04.536
We're gonna be boring students
who live in a world...

06:04.714 --> 06:07.740
...where the V-word is not uttered.
- Got it.

06:07.917 --> 06:10.351
Then later, you're gonna take me
to the Ferris wheel.

06:10.520 --> 06:12.954
We're gonna ride to the top,
you're gonna kiss me.

06:13.122 --> 06:15.283
And my heart will flutter
like a normal girl.

06:15.458 --> 06:18.222
- Do you see a running theme here?
- Yeah. I'm seeing it.

06:18.394 --> 06:20.919
I'm liking it.
But I have a quick question.

06:21.097 --> 06:25.397
- Um, what do we do about Damon?
- Uh, no D-word, okay?

06:25.568 --> 06:29.026
That has been deleted from
the list of topics that we can discuss.

06:29.839 --> 06:35.106
Unfortunately, Katherine showing up
has him in a little bit of an odd place.

06:35.278 --> 06:38.247
A little off-kilter. Kind of dangerous.

06:38.414 --> 06:40.041
Who knows what he's up to.

06:41.918 --> 06:44.682
So I understand John Gilbert
has left town.

06:44.854 --> 06:46.947
Have they found the vampire
that attacked him?

06:47.557 --> 06:49.582
Sheriff asked me to take the lead on that.

06:49.759 --> 06:52.353
And I promise you,
I will get to the bottom of it.

06:52.528 --> 06:55.520
Which brings me to my next subject.

06:55.698 --> 07:00.067
With Richard gone, I'll be acting
as interim mayor until the elections.

07:00.236 --> 07:02.602
And I'm going to need someone
to spearhead the Council.

07:02.772 --> 07:03.898
Hmm.

07:04.073 --> 07:05.540
I'd like that person to be you.

07:07.376 --> 07:08.604
Whatever you need, Carol.

07:09.178 --> 07:12.238
As a founding family member,
it's something that's close to me...

07:12.415 --> 07:16.317
...so I would be honored to help keep
this town safe from vampires.

07:19.455 --> 07:21.252
Oh, jeez.

07:24.060 --> 07:25.288
Is it safe to talk?

07:26.095 --> 07:28.586
It's my brother-in-law, Mason.
He's still visiting.

07:28.764 --> 07:30.664
I just don't want him to hear us.

07:30.833 --> 07:33.233
He didn't want any part of the Council
when he lived here...

07:33.402 --> 07:35.768
...and I see no reason
to bring him into it now.

07:36.906 --> 07:38.430
<i>What was that, like seven?</i>

07:38.908 --> 07:41.342
Six. I don't count the last one.

07:41.511 --> 07:43.741
- You crawled it.
- What?

07:43.913 --> 07:47.110
Think Grandma Lockwood
actually passed you. In her walker.

07:47.283 --> 07:52.619
- Yeah. Okay. Shoes off. Mud. My mom.
- Cool. Yeah, yeah.

07:54.457 --> 07:57.426
So all this anger and aggression
you were talking about.

07:58.261 --> 08:00.058
You notice the difference
when you exercise?

08:01.430 --> 08:02.522
Dude, I played three varsity sports.

08:03.099 --> 08:06.000
I work out four times a week
and run three. I'm gonna say no.

08:06.169 --> 08:10.265
You have episodes?
I mean, what happens exactly?

08:10.439 --> 08:15.274
Starts out normal. I mean, I get angry.
Typically over nothing.

08:15.444 --> 08:18.936
I'm an angry guy. You know,
it just amplifies and then I go off.

08:19.115 --> 08:23.814
- You black out?
- Yeah. It's like I go blind with rage.

08:25.321 --> 08:29.883
Is there a pattern? Like, once a month?
Only at night?

08:31.494 --> 08:34.019
All I know is I lose myself. You know?

08:35.498 --> 08:38.558
For that time, I become something else.
And I hate it.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.895
More tea? Damon?

08:41.571 --> 08:46.031
Oh, yes, please. Thank you, Carol.

09:06.529 --> 09:10.021
- Your mom said you're not eating.
- It's gross.

09:10.499 --> 09:13.832
It's hospital food.
It's supposed to be gross.

09:17.873 --> 09:21.604
She also said you're getting released
tomorrow morning.

09:22.178 --> 09:24.942
Morning? I need to get out tonight.

09:25.114 --> 09:27.912
No. The carnival is gonna happen
without you, Caroline.

09:28.084 --> 09:31.281
I know it's hard for your
neurotic personality to process...

09:31.454 --> 09:34.014
...but Bonnie and Elena have it.
- I'm not neurotic.

09:34.190 --> 09:36.181
Yeah, you are, but it's cute, so...

09:36.859 --> 09:38.520
Look, it's not about the carnival.

09:38.694 --> 09:41.925
Okay? It's just that this place
is just really depressing.

09:42.098 --> 09:45.761
- That's because you're sitting in dark.
- No, don't!

09:48.070 --> 09:50.937
- What the hell?
- Just close it. Please?

09:51.407 --> 09:53.136
- What's wrong with you?
- Close it.

09:58.147 --> 09:59.705
Okay.

10:01.550 --> 10:03.916
I'll just come back later, okay?

10:21.604 --> 10:25.938
- Would you care for one?
- No. Thank you. Not hungry. Just ate.

10:27.243 --> 10:31.145
Aren't you worried that one day all the
forest animals are gonna band together...

10:31.314 --> 10:34.147
...and fight back?
I mean, surely, they talk.

10:34.317 --> 10:38.253
I'm just happy that's a blood bag
and not a sorority girl...

10:38.421 --> 10:39.649
...supplying your dinner.

10:41.824 --> 10:42.848
I like this.

10:43.025 --> 10:46.517
You walking on eggshells around me...

10:46.696 --> 10:49.927
...because you think I'm gonna explode.
It's very suspenseful.

10:50.099 --> 10:54.968
Is Elena worried too?
I bet I'm your every conversation.

10:55.137 --> 10:57.264
Have you heard from Katherine?

10:58.541 --> 11:00.600
I think the Lockwoods
have a family secret.

11:01.110 --> 11:03.510
The Gilbert device affected them
but vervain didn't.

11:03.679 --> 11:06.773
So they're not vampires.
They're something else.

11:06.949 --> 11:09.179
Is this your new obsession?

11:09.352 --> 11:12.446
Oh, you'd rather
some unknown supernatural element...

11:12.621 --> 11:16.022
...running rampant in our town.
Fine. I'll drop it.

11:16.659 --> 11:20.390
We haven't seen the last of Katherine.
You do know that, right?

11:20.563 --> 11:23.794
- We have no idea what she's up to.
- Pfft. Sure, we do.

11:23.966 --> 11:27.231
She came back to profess
her undying, eternal love for you.

11:27.436 --> 11:30.132
So I'm gonna let you deal with her.

11:30.306 --> 11:33.139
Because I have more important things
to do...

11:33.309 --> 11:34.606
...like explode.

11:36.579 --> 11:38.513
Cheers.

11:58.968 --> 12:00.162
That's pretty.

12:02.571 --> 12:04.835
Yeah, my friend gave it to me.

12:46.315 --> 12:48.010
What's wrong?

12:50.619 --> 12:56.251
You can't tell anyone.
You can't tell anyone!

12:58.160 --> 12:59.718
I can't tell anyone.

12:59.895 --> 13:01.522
You'll do what I say?

13:02.665 --> 13:05.725
- I'll do what you say.
- Good.

13:08.771 --> 13:11.137
Because I'm starving.

13:28.157 --> 13:30.182
Ring toss
is out of Bart and Homer dolls...

13:30.392 --> 13:31.859
...and Team Jacob tees.
- Okay.

13:32.027 --> 13:35.394
I'll grab some from Science Club.
We lost a speaker in the karaoke booth.

13:35.564 --> 13:39.967
Hey, all good, Elena. Take a beat,
look around, this is a huge success.

13:40.469 --> 13:43.131
You mean I can do
more than just wreak vampire havoc?

13:43.305 --> 13:45.034
Go figure.

13:47.276 --> 13:51.645
Hey, uh, Carter, right?
You're with the carnival.

13:51.814 --> 13:54.180
- That'd be me.
- Okay, great.

13:54.350 --> 13:56.875
Wow. What you need, beautiful?

13:57.052 --> 14:00.920
Ha, ha. What do you know
about karaoke speakers?

14:02.658 --> 14:03.716
Show me the problem.

14:03.926 --> 14:06.656
Yeah, Bonnie, show him the problem.

14:08.230 --> 14:10.562
- Okay. Come on.
- Come on?

14:34.857 --> 14:37.223
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

14:37.393 --> 14:39.918
Nothing. Just killing time.
Waiting for you.

14:40.095 --> 14:43.861
- You looking for something? What?
- Yeah, actually.

14:44.066 --> 14:46.830
You know where I could I find
any family artifact stuff?

14:47.002 --> 14:49.869
- The heirlooms?
- Heh, blow through trust fund already?

14:50.039 --> 14:51.734
Ha, ha, I did that when I was 22.

14:52.541 --> 14:55.032
No, I'm just looking for this old piece
of my mom's.

14:55.210 --> 14:57.269
My dad gave it to her
when they got married.

14:57.479 --> 14:58.707
It's sentimental value.

14:58.881 --> 15:02.078
Probably passed down to your dad.
Should be in the house somewhere.

15:02.251 --> 15:05.186
- What's it look like?
- It's a moonstone.

15:05.354 --> 15:08.687
It's about the size of a hockey puck.
Old, ugly.

15:08.857 --> 15:12.122
- Minimal monetary value.
- Hey, man, whatever.

15:12.494 --> 15:16.521
- Um, ask my mom, I guess.
- Yeah, cool. I'll do that.

15:17.132 --> 15:19.293
- You ready?
- Yeah.

15:29.011 --> 15:32.208
Jeremy. So good to see you alive.

15:32.381 --> 15:34.747
Aren't you a little old
for a school carnival?

15:34.917 --> 15:36.248
About 150 years too old.

15:36.418 --> 15:38.978
You're pretty funny cracking jokes
when I could...

15:39.154 --> 15:42.817
...blow the whole lid off this thing
by telling someone what you really are.

15:47.596 --> 15:50.588
So please tell me that
that is not a threat.

15:50.766 --> 15:52.961
Maybe it is.

15:53.335 --> 15:55.030
Oh.

15:57.106 --> 15:59.336
This is what we're not gonna do.

15:59.541 --> 16:02.101
We're not gonna walk around
like we're invincible...

16:02.277 --> 16:04.939
...when it's this easy for me
to end you.

16:08.917 --> 16:12.819
If you wanna tell people
what I really am, go ahead and try.

16:12.988 --> 16:15.786
I will shove this ring
so far up your ass...

16:15.958 --> 16:18.449
...you'll really have something
to choke on.

16:23.332 --> 16:25.698
The doctor said I'm good as new.
He signed me out.

16:25.868 --> 16:30.567
He said I didn't have to wait till morning.
So call me when you get this.

16:31.640 --> 16:33.870
It's dark, thank God.

16:35.010 --> 16:39.344
Um, I am so sorry about that.

16:39.515 --> 16:41.107
Okay. Now what's the story?

16:41.817 --> 16:45.150
- My husband likes to get kinky.
- Yes. Good.

16:46.321 --> 16:50.348
Okay, so I'm gonna take off.

16:50.526 --> 16:54.292
I'm committee chair for the carnival.
I'm worried it's a complete disaster.

16:54.463 --> 16:59.526
God bless Elena, but she does not
understand the word "fabulous."

16:59.702 --> 17:02.796
Once again,
I am so sorry about that...

17:02.971 --> 17:06.406
...and if you could just forget
that I bit you...

17:07.108 --> 17:09.509
...that would be great
because I'm going to.

17:10.646 --> 17:12.637
Forget what?

17:13.882 --> 17:17.545
I don't know how that works,
but it's brilliant.

17:22.191 --> 17:24.819
Uh-huh. You're lurking.

17:25.027 --> 17:27.154
- I'm observing.
- More like obsessing.

17:30.566 --> 17:32.329
He's got strength.

17:32.501 --> 17:35.732
He's a triple-letter varsity athlete.
Of course he has strength.

17:35.904 --> 17:38.270
You're reaching.

17:38.440 --> 17:40.567
- I bet I can take you.
- Enter the uncle.

17:40.743 --> 17:43.473
- Bring it on, surfer boy.
- This is ridiculous.

17:51.653 --> 17:53.780
- Damn!
- Is that it?

17:55.691 --> 17:57.181
All right. He's the champ.

17:57.359 --> 17:59.850
- Who wants to go next?
- Hey, Stefan wants a go.

18:02.464 --> 18:04.955
Yeah, sure.
I'II, uh, give it a shot, you know.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.828
Go, Stef.

18:07.636 --> 18:08.967
Get him, Stef.

18:09.738 --> 18:11.933
My brother over there thinks
I can beat you.

18:13.375 --> 18:14.467
Your brother's wrong.

18:26.054 --> 18:27.487
Come on.

18:27.956 --> 18:31.892
- You didn't put in any effort at all.
- Yeah, actually I did.

18:35.597 --> 18:36.621
Come with me.

18:44.940 --> 18:46.908
- Is he...?
- It wasn't that kind of strength.

18:47.075 --> 18:49.134
It was more than human,
if that makes sense.

18:49.311 --> 18:50.710
What is up with that family?

18:51.213 --> 18:53.204
If they're not vampires
then what the hell are they?

18:53.382 --> 18:56.783
Ooh, uh, maybe they're ninja turtles?

18:56.952 --> 18:59.512
- You're not funny.
- Or, no. Zombies. Werewolves.

19:00.088 --> 19:01.715
No comedic timing at all.

19:04.760 --> 19:07.024
What? What are you up to?

19:07.229 --> 19:11.598
Since this is reality and there's no such
thing as werewolves or combat turtles...

19:11.767 --> 19:14.361
- It's a ninja turtle, actually.
- Hey, you.

19:14.536 --> 19:16.595
- I have a name.
- Yeah, I don't care.

19:16.772 --> 19:18.433
Wha...?

19:19.041 --> 19:21.441
I need you to pick a fight
with someone.

19:21.610 --> 19:23.544
Kid named Tyler Lockwood.

19:23.745 --> 19:26.339
- Damon, don't do this.
- It's just an experiment.

19:27.182 --> 19:30.777
Get him mad. But don't back down
no matter what he does. Okay?

19:31.453 --> 19:34.320
- I won't back down.
- I know you won't.

19:39.862 --> 19:41.727
You realize somebody's gonna get hurt.

19:41.897 --> 19:46.163
- Someone's gonna get mad. As in rage.
- Why? What's that gonna accomplish?

19:46.335 --> 19:49.862
That Tyler kid is incapable
of walking away from a fight.

19:50.672 --> 19:51.969
Let's see who intervenes.

19:52.140 --> 19:55.371
Maybe it's the ambiguously supernatural
mystery uncle.

20:05.554 --> 20:07.385
Oh, hey, blondie.

20:07.890 --> 20:09.050
They let you out?

20:10.859 --> 20:12.087
I remember.

20:14.596 --> 20:18.692
- What do you remember?
- I remember how you manipulated me.

20:20.235 --> 20:23.398
You pushed me around. Abused me.

20:24.072 --> 20:27.200
Erased my memories. Fed on me.

20:27.676 --> 20:29.007
You're crazy.

20:29.177 --> 20:32.237
Well, the memories have been
coming back. In pieces.

20:33.382 --> 20:36.374
You can't remember. It's impossible.

20:36.551 --> 20:40.214
I mean, unless you were becoming a...

20:44.226 --> 20:46.421
I have a message from Katherine.

20:48.897 --> 20:52.025
- She said, "Game on."
- Wait.

20:57.239 --> 20:58.570
You suck.

21:09.051 --> 21:11.246
- Elena.
- What do you want, Damon?

21:11.420 --> 21:14.912
I'm the last person you wanna see,
but I need you to come with me.

21:15.090 --> 21:16.921
Whatever it is, I'm not interested.

21:17.092 --> 21:19.856
I need you to come with me
right now, Elena.

21:39.915 --> 21:42.543
- Watch where you're going.
- You got a problem?

21:42.718 --> 21:44.208
Yeah, you walked right into me.

21:44.386 --> 21:47.287
- What are you gonna do about it?
- You're kidding, right?

21:49.391 --> 21:51.382
You better back off.

21:52.794 --> 21:54.853
You hit me again, I swear to God...

21:57.666 --> 21:59.998
Hey! Tyler.

22:00.168 --> 22:02.329
Tyler! Hey! Hey, dude.

22:02.504 --> 22:05.803
Get back. What the hell, man?

22:18.954 --> 22:20.012
Your eyes.

22:27.529 --> 22:30.293
Come on. Gotta go.

22:35.604 --> 22:37.299
You all right, man?

22:38.840 --> 22:40.705
Why did I just do that?

22:41.610 --> 22:44.477
You were just in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

22:47.649 --> 22:50.618
- What are you doing here?
- They discharged me. All better.

22:50.786 --> 22:52.014
How do you feel?

22:53.188 --> 22:55.213
Heh, I feel pretty good.

22:55.724 --> 22:58.784
- Because earlier, you were a little...
- I'm all better.

22:59.528 --> 23:02.588
- All better. Heh, heh.
- Okay.

23:02.764 --> 23:04.857
- You wanna give it a shot?
- Yeah.

23:09.171 --> 23:10.866
Whoa. Uh...

23:11.039 --> 23:12.700
Hey, nice shot, killer.

23:13.308 --> 23:15.538
Uh, they must've already been broken.

23:19.748 --> 23:22.581
- Oh, no.
- What's wrong?

23:25.320 --> 23:28.187
- I gotta go.
- What?

23:28.356 --> 23:31.189
No, Care, wait. Are you okay?
Do you need to go back...?

23:31.359 --> 23:33.350
No. Just leave me alone.

23:34.996 --> 23:36.725
How did this happen, hmm?

23:36.898 --> 23:39.332
I fed her blood
and Katherine killed her.

23:39.501 --> 23:42.902
- And A plus B equals...
- But why?

23:43.071 --> 23:46.006
Because Katherine is a manipulative,
nasty little slut.

23:46.174 --> 23:48.665
And she said, "Game on"?
What does that even mean?

23:48.844 --> 23:51.312
It means she's playing dirty.
She wants us to know.

23:51.480 --> 23:52.674
But why Caroline?

23:52.848 --> 23:55.180
- I don't know.
- Caroline must be out of her mind.

23:55.350 --> 23:58.444
- She has no idea what's happening.
- Oh, I think she does.

23:58.620 --> 24:02.613
All my compulsion started wearing off
the minute she was in transition.

24:02.791 --> 24:05.487
- We have to find her.
- Yep, and kill her.

24:06.228 --> 24:08.958
- You're not gonna kill Caroline.
- She knows who we are.

24:09.131 --> 24:13.363
- She's a liability. We gotta get rid of her.
- Damon. Absolutely not.

24:13.802 --> 24:17.294
Need I remind you of a tragic little story
of a girl named Vicki Donovan?

24:17.772 --> 24:18.796
Yeah.

24:19.007 --> 24:22.909
Caroline will not make it as a vampire.
Her mother is a vampire hunter.

24:23.078 --> 24:26.878
We all know how this story ends.
Let's just flip to the last chapter and...

24:27.048 --> 24:28.777
It's not an option, Damon.

24:29.651 --> 24:31.448
No?

24:31.620 --> 24:33.986
Your silence is deafening, Stefan.

24:34.156 --> 24:37.387
Wait, wasn't there a school carnival
the night you staked Vicki?

24:40.095 --> 24:42.928
Talk about a town
where history repeats itself.

24:43.098 --> 24:44.224
You know I'm right.

24:48.303 --> 24:49.600
We're not gonna kill her.

24:53.842 --> 24:55.070
It's the only way.

25:12.327 --> 25:15.421
- Hey, is everything okay?
- No.

25:17.632 --> 25:21.329
- I'm so sorry.
- What?

25:42.257 --> 25:45.852
She's obviously pissed at me
for something, but for what? No clue.

25:46.261 --> 25:49.059
- Well, what happened?
- She freaked out.

25:49.231 --> 25:50.823
And she's been like that all day.

25:50.999 --> 25:53.559
Cool one minute,
and crazy neurotic the next.

25:53.735 --> 25:56.568
She almost died.
It's bound to mess with her head.

25:56.738 --> 25:59.673
- Plus, she's Caroline.
- Yeah.

25:59.874 --> 26:03.674
I'm used to the insecurities and all that.
It's who she is, love it or hate it.

26:03.878 --> 26:10.750
But this seemed,
I don't know, different. More.

26:10.919 --> 26:12.944
L... I can't explain it.

26:28.670 --> 26:32.697
You agree with Damon,
don't you? Stefan?

26:35.277 --> 26:39.304
- Stefan. Hey.
- Damon's right.

26:39.481 --> 26:42.507
Not about what we should do,
but about what's gonna happen.

26:42.684 --> 26:46.017
Katherine all but signed
Caroline's death sentence.

26:46.187 --> 26:47.848
Well, we can't let it end that way.

26:51.526 --> 26:53.187
She's doing this to me, isn't she?

26:54.062 --> 26:56.622
Actually, she's doing it to me.

27:01.536 --> 27:04.903
All right, we're home. Safe territory.
Enough with the silence.

27:05.073 --> 27:07.371
- Leave it alone.
- What was that move you pulled?

27:07.542 --> 27:10.306
Brazilian martial arts.
I took some classes a while back.

27:10.478 --> 27:12.139
- Don't lie to me.
- I'm not lying.

27:12.314 --> 27:13.508
I saw something.

27:17.152 --> 27:20.553
- You didn't see anything.
- I saw your eyes.

27:21.956 --> 27:25.084
- They glowed.
- Reflection of a car headlight, maybe.

27:25.260 --> 27:28.195
Reflection of a car headlight?
You expect me to believe that?

27:28.363 --> 27:30.661
Tyler! Hey!
You wanna know what you saw?

27:30.832 --> 27:35.735
You saw me get pissed off that I had
to pull your delinquent ass out of a fight.

27:45.914 --> 27:48.007
Where could she be?

27:49.918 --> 27:51.681
What is it? Do you hear her?

27:53.221 --> 27:55.212
What's going on, Stefan? What is it?

27:55.390 --> 27:58.621
Blood. I can smell blood.

28:06.868 --> 28:08.836
He's dead.

28:09.738 --> 28:11.729
I killed him.

28:16.711 --> 28:18.235
What's wrong with me?

28:18.413 --> 28:21.143
Hey. Hey, it's okay.

28:22.584 --> 28:25.644
- I can help you.
- You can?

28:25.820 --> 28:27.378
Yeah. I have to.

28:32.160 --> 28:37.223
- What are you going to do?
- The only thing I can do.

28:41.069 --> 28:42.093
I'm gonna kill you.

28:51.646 --> 28:54.479
Please don't. I don't want to die.

28:54.649 --> 28:57.641
- Yeah, but you're already dead.
- No, I'm not.

28:57.819 --> 29:00.481
Don't say that. Okay? Just help me.

29:00.655 --> 29:02.919
- Okay.
- Okay? Just help me.

29:03.091 --> 29:05.889
- Please. Please. Please.
- Okay, okay, okay.

29:06.428 --> 29:07.861
It's gonna be okay.

29:08.897 --> 29:11.491
Gonna be okay. It's the only way.

29:14.402 --> 29:16.029
Stephan!

29:16.805 --> 29:19.330
Get away from me. You killed me.

29:19.507 --> 29:21.202
No, no, Caroline, that wasn't me.

29:21.376 --> 29:22.673
That was Katherine.

29:22.844 --> 29:27.178
No! Then why does she look like you?
And why? Why did she do this to me?

29:27.348 --> 29:29.873
- We gotta get her inside.
- Caroline, come with me.

29:30.051 --> 29:32.542
She will die.
It's only a matter of time.

29:32.720 --> 29:34.881
Maybe so.
But it's not gonna happen tonight.

29:35.056 --> 29:36.887
Oh, yeah, it is.

29:42.096 --> 29:43.723
Damon, she's my friend.

29:50.338 --> 29:53.205
Whatever happens, it's on you.

29:57.979 --> 29:59.571
- Get her cleaned up.
- Caroline?

30:00.148 --> 30:02.480
- It's okay. Come on.
- No.

30:02.650 --> 30:05.050
You're not. You can't. You can't be.

30:11.593 --> 30:12.855
Bonnie.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.127
- Oh, God!
- Bonnie.

30:41.256 --> 30:43.247
- It's all right. Come here.
- She hates me.

30:43.424 --> 30:44.755
- No, no.
- Bonnie hates me.

30:44.926 --> 30:47.588
No, no, no. She's just in shock.
We all are, okay?

30:47.762 --> 30:49.662
And what about Matt?

30:49.831 --> 30:51.526
- What am I supposed to do about Matt?
- Shh.

30:51.699 --> 30:54.896
One thing at a time.
Let's just get this blood cleaned off.

30:56.938 --> 31:01.466
I'm a murderer. I'm a monster.

31:01.643 --> 31:04.976
Your emotions are heightened right now.
It's part of transformation.

31:05.146 --> 31:08.707
It's completely normal.
I promise you, okay?

31:09.284 --> 31:11.946
God! And why does this
keep happening to my face?

31:12.120 --> 31:14.953
- I'm hideous.
- Caroline. Look at me. Look at me.

31:15.123 --> 31:17.489
Caroline. Look at me. Look at me.

31:17.659 --> 31:21.459
Look at my face.
Look at my face. Shh, shh. Look, look.

31:21.629 --> 31:25.656
See it? You see that? Yeah?

31:25.833 --> 31:29.166
When you feel the blood rush,
tell yourself you're gonna get through it.

31:29.337 --> 31:30.998
That you're strong enough. Yes.

31:31.172 --> 31:34.733
No matter how good it feels
to give yourself over to it...

31:34.943 --> 31:38.435
...you fight it off, you bury it.
Watch me. Watch me.

31:40.214 --> 31:44.810
That's the only way you're gonna
survive this thing. Try. Shh. Try.

31:49.457 --> 31:51.186
That's good.

31:59.200 --> 32:01.031
Why did Katherine do this to me?

32:04.706 --> 32:07.732
I don't know. I wish I did.

32:09.410 --> 32:11.275
Hey. Hey.

32:12.380 --> 32:16.282
I promise you,
I will not let anything happen to you.

32:18.419 --> 32:21.286
Come here. Come here.

32:23.725 --> 32:25.852
I can't believe this is happening.

32:26.027 --> 32:29.190
Come on, don't pout about it.
You got a body to bury.

32:32.200 --> 32:35.431
Thought you were calling the shots. No?

32:38.072 --> 32:39.505
Sucks to be you, buddy.

32:58.226 --> 33:01.127
I told you what would happen
if anyone else got hurt.

33:01.295 --> 33:04.594
- I didn't do this.
- Bonnie, it wasn't his fault.

33:05.299 --> 33:08.564
Everything that happens
is his fault, Elena.

33:09.737 --> 33:11.227
Bonnie, what are you doing?

33:17.645 --> 33:20.478
Bonnie, stop it. Bonnie.
Bonnie, stop it.

33:24.352 --> 33:26.843
Bonnie, stop it.
You're gonna kill him.

33:31.926 --> 33:33.655
Bonnie!

33:34.996 --> 33:38.022
Hey! Bonnie.

33:38.199 --> 33:42.101
- Why? Why did you stop me?
- Because this isn't us.

33:42.270 --> 33:44.864
Bonnie, this can't be us.

33:45.940 --> 33:47.567
Come on.

33:49.844 --> 33:51.675
Oh, God.

34:00.254 --> 34:04.884
Hey. Hey. Caroline's okay for now.
I'm gonna check in on her later.

34:05.426 --> 34:10.090
- What about the guy that she...?
- Ugh, it's taken care of.

34:10.797 --> 34:15.428
Damon's right, isn't he?
It won't end well for her.

34:15.603 --> 34:18.299
No, I'm gonna make sure
that he's wrong.

34:19.607 --> 34:23.007
I just... I can't believe
what this day has turned into.

34:25.279 --> 34:26.871
Not your normal day, huh?

34:27.248 --> 34:28.840
Mm-mm.

34:29.951 --> 34:34.388
I was stupid to think that it could be.
I mean, nothing about my life is normal.

34:34.889 --> 34:36.914
My best friend is a witch.

34:37.091 --> 34:38.251
Boyfriend's a vampire...

34:38.426 --> 34:42.920
...and I have a doppelganger
who's hell-bent on destroying all of us.

34:43.598 --> 34:45.327
I'm sorry.

34:46.100 --> 34:49.558
No, it's not your fault, Stefan.
It's no one's fault.

34:49.771 --> 34:52.672
You know, it is what it is.

34:54.641 --> 34:57.770
I'm fine. I'm fine.

34:57.945 --> 35:01.779
It's just... You know what? I'm fine.

35:01.949 --> 35:06.181
Okay. I'm gonna call you tomorrow.
Okay?

35:06.354 --> 35:10.552
- Good night, Stefan.
- Good night.

35:10.925 --> 35:13.325
MRS. LOCKWOOD: It's good for Tyler
to have you in the house.

35:13.494 --> 35:15.018
- I appreciate that, Carol.
- Hmm.

35:15.196 --> 35:18.290
Oh, and I can see if I can dig up
that stone you're looking for.

35:18.466 --> 35:22.061
It's bound to be tucked away
in one of Richard's nooks and crannies.

35:25.173 --> 35:27.198
- Hey, man. You heading up?
- In a minute.

35:27.775 --> 35:29.868
- Night, Mom.
- Night, Tyler.

35:31.479 --> 35:34.141
Hey, I'm sorry about earlier.
We all good?

35:34.315 --> 35:36.783
- Yeah. We're good.
- All right.

36:45.386 --> 36:47.752
Hell are you doing here?

36:47.922 --> 36:50.390
You don't lock your front door.

36:51.492 --> 36:52.516
Yeah.

36:52.693 --> 36:56.220
No, I wouldn't. I laced it with vervain.

37:00.868 --> 37:02.096
Now why would you do that?

37:03.271 --> 37:05.865
So I could stake you with this.

37:10.578 --> 37:12.671
You came here to kill me?

37:12.847 --> 37:15.475
Well, it's only fair. You killed me first.

37:20.454 --> 37:22.615
What made you wisen up?

37:23.791 --> 37:27.454
My father hated vampires.
My uncle too.

37:27.962 --> 37:31.420
They were absolute.
They knew exactly what they stood for.

37:31.599 --> 37:34.625
And I figure maybe I should too.
I mean, stand for something.

37:35.469 --> 37:38.632
But killing you, what's that gonna do?

37:39.774 --> 37:42.106
Look, I don't do the big brother thing
very well.

37:42.276 --> 37:45.473
Sorry I don't have
any cookies and milk to offer you.

37:46.614 --> 37:48.104
Dick.

37:48.649 --> 37:50.139
Wait.

37:53.421 --> 37:57.653
- My father hated vampires too.
- He did?

37:58.859 --> 38:02.488
Same reason your Dad did.
Only it was 1864.

38:03.764 --> 38:05.391
People knew how to whittle.

38:07.768 --> 38:12.262
- Did you do this?
- Yeah, I tried. It's harder than it looks.

38:13.107 --> 38:14.506
Huh.

38:25.286 --> 38:27.345
What are you doing here?

38:27.855 --> 38:29.186
Uh...

38:29.357 --> 38:34.488
I came to see if today's
basket-case period had expired.

38:36.163 --> 38:38.791
You should just go because
my mom's gonna be home soon.

38:38.966 --> 38:42.697
You've been dodging me all day. I mean,
I'm more insecure than you are now.

38:43.771 --> 38:45.966
What do you mean?

38:46.140 --> 38:50.270
It means that you almost died
and it really freaked me out.

38:50.911 --> 38:55.143
And it got me thinking, you know,
because I'm just...

38:55.316 --> 38:59.047
I'm not in a position where I can lose
someone else right now.

38:59.220 --> 39:02.519
I realized that even though today
I wanted to throttle you...

39:04.325 --> 39:07.419
...I'm pretty sure
that I'm in love with you.

39:08.662 --> 39:11.688
And now it seems like
you don't feel the same way.

39:59.980 --> 40:07.045
- Mm. Hi. What time is it?
- It's almost dawn. Come with me.

40:10.991 --> 40:14.392
Stefan, what are we doing here?
We're gonna get caught.

40:14.562 --> 40:16.393
I compelled the guard
to go on break...

40:16.564 --> 40:20.295
...so I could kiss my girlfriend
on top of the Ferris wheel.

40:26.807 --> 40:30.402
- Stefan...
- We have to take these moments, Elena.

40:31.312 --> 40:35.112
All right? What Katherine did to Caroline
could just be the beginning.

40:35.282 --> 40:38.149
There's things with Tyler's family
that we don't understand.

40:38.319 --> 40:40.685
And there's always the D-word.

40:40.888 --> 40:45.689
But I came back to this town
to start a life with you.

40:48.095 --> 40:50.188
We can't forget to live it.

41:00.274 --> 41:02.936
But, Stefan, how are we gonna
get to the top?

41:03.611 --> 41:06.546
I guess you'll just have to hold on tight.

41:20.327 --> 41:21.351
What?

41:23.664 --> 41:25.564
It's just so nice to see you laugh.

41:40.881 --> 41:42.974
It's not gonna get any easier, is it?

41:49.089 --> 41:51.557
No. It's not.
