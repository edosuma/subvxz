Yeah, I was just left on hold by IT.

- It's not the wifi.

Could somebody please fix the wifi?

10:07.603 --> 10:08.702
On it.

- Nope, nope, not the wifi.

data files, backups,

11:02.877 --> 11:04.410
possibly someone in this room,

11:04.446 --> 11:08.447
fell victim to a phishing email.

11:08.483 --> 11:10.483
This has nothing to do
with catch and release.

11:10.518 --> 11:14.353
Phishing with a PH, Zachary.
It's a cyberattack.

11:14.388 --> 11:16.722

identity theft last year.

11:23.898 --> 11:25.063
Everyone's trying to get Andrew to talk.

11:25.099 --> 11:26.499
Apparently he was in the board room

11:26.534 --> 11:28.333
where the meeting was happening.

11:28.369 --> 11:30.482
<i>This is Alfonso with
Twitter technical support.</i>

11:30.517 --> 11:31.303
Hello.

11:31.338 --> 11:33.005
Come on, man.
You've gotta give us something.

11:33.040 --> 11:34.707
At least tell us how much the ransom is.

11:34.742 --> 11:38.377
I'm not one who's gonna
break confidentiality.

11:38.412 --> 11:39.945
But I will say that it was a lot.

11:39.981 --> 11:42.414
Hey, can you at least tell us
if we're going to lose all our data?

11:43.002 --> 11:44.048
I don't...

11:44.084 --> 11:45.884
What if this ends up like the Sony hack?

11:45.919 --> 11:47.919
Wait, you mean, like,
all of our emails getting out there?

11:47.954 --> 11:49.888
No one's talking about our
emails being released, right?

11:49.923 --> 11:52.223
Well, they should,
because that's a real possibility.

11:52.258 --> 11:54.425
Well, I for one have nothing
to really worry about so I'm...

11:54.460 --> 11:56.160
Oh, no, no, no.

11:58.097 --> 11:59.597
Okay, I'm listening

11:59.633 --> 12:01.298
but I am also on hold
with Alfonso at Twitter.

12:01.334 --> 12:03.200
I can't believe we got hacked.

12:03.236 --> 12:06.938
I mean, this is a disaster for Safford.

12:07.526 --> 12:08.540
What?

12:08.575 --> 12:11.709
You know, you trash-talking
Patrick on the regular.

12:11.745 --> 12:13.177
Oh, yeah, you do do that.

12:13.212 --> 12:15.013
No, I don't. I don't trash-talk.

12:15.048 --> 12:17.048
- I vent.
- I vent.

12:17.083 --> 12:18.849
You go for the jugular,
and you leave a paper trail.

12:18.884 --> 12:21.852
Okay, fine, I've been known to let out

12:21.887 --> 12:25.050
some of my frustration via email
but, okay, whatever.

12:25.085 --> 12:27.558
I'm worried because I just
started getting Ingrid

12:27.593 --> 12:31.028
to trust me and if these emails
get out, her name gets out...

12:31.064 --> 12:33.697
Jane, they're gonna figure
out a way around the hack,

12:33.732 --> 12:35.732
and if they don't,
they'll pay the ransom.

12:43.309 --> 12:47.278
Does she have a minute?

12:47.313 --> 12:49.746
Hey, Jacqueline,
Andrew said you had a minute.

12:49.782 --> 12:51.682
More like 30 seconds.

12:51.717 --> 12:54.150
I know you can't tell me
about what's going on,

12:54.186 --> 12:57.087
but, I'm worried about Ingrid.

12:57.122 --> 12:59.923
We promised we would keep her name safe.

12:59.959 --> 13:01.524
You sent me the recording.

13:01.560 --> 13:02.960
This email gets out...

13:02.995 --> 13:06.129
You're completely right to be worried.

13:06.164 --> 13:08.832
The hackers threatened
to release our data

13:08.867 --> 13:11.101
if the ransom is not met.

13:11.136 --> 13:13.236
I am doing everything I can
on my end to make sure

13:13.271 --> 13:18.742
that doesn't happen,
but I'm not the only voice in the room.

13:18.777 --> 13:21.612
You're gonna have to talk to Ingrid.

13:21.647 --> 13:25.749
Be honest with her and reassuring.

13:25.784 --> 13:30.152
Tell her that if we can just
get a name of somebody that saw

13:30.187 --> 13:32.287
what happened to her,
we'd be able to back up her story

13:32.323 --> 13:36.025
if this hack goes south.

13:36.060 --> 13:38.160
You gotta earn her trust, Jane.

13:38.195 --> 13:39.962
I will.

13:49.107 --> 13:50.906
Are you soundtracking your life?

13:50.942 --> 13:53.643
Nope, just in a war of wits
with Twitter tech support.

13:53.678 --> 13:55.878
I'm answering questions on my
social media about the hack

13:55.913 --> 13:59.148
using #Saffordhack,
so I suggest you do the same.

13:59.183 --> 14:02.416
Uh, did you not get the memo from PR?
We're supposed to wait

14:02.452 --> 14:04.719
before posting anything
for official word.

14:04.755 --> 14:07.388
Our website's down,
so I think if I stay silent

14:07.423 --> 14:08.990
that will raise more alarm.

14:09.026 --> 14:10.391
Also I'm the head of digital

happy in Connecticut.

You've got a house,
and a backyard, a pool.

31:06.036 --> 31:08.504
But me, I love design, I love the city

like normal people...

night even happened.

like she's my date and then

the next minute,
it's all endorsements and ad buys and...

32:48.369 --> 32:51.104

people up for donations.

a lot of time together

know you and talk you up.

34:53.658 --> 34:56.859

Yeah, if you got another impression
