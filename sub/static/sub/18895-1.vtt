01:43.407 --> 01:44.442
Papa.

01:45.527 --> 01:47.245
Every thing is fine.

01:47.407 --> 01:49.398
Papa, tell me about it again.

01:51.247 --> 01:54.080
It's very different this new country.

01:54.367 --> 01:56.722
A very peculiar land.
- Yes, but tell me again.

01:56.887 --> 01:57.797
How I won't believe my eyes.

01:58.127 --> 02:02.040
They put raisins in the pork roast.

02:02.207 --> 02:04.118
And butter on your bread.

02:04.807 --> 02:07.037
At least half an inch thick layer.

02:07.567 --> 02:11.526
The brandy is cheaper
than water.

02:11.927 --> 02:14.885
But strong enough to
knock kill an ox.

02:15.167 --> 02:18.204
But your father can
handle it, Pelle.

02:18.407 --> 02:19.442
Because he's hard.

02:19.607 --> 02:22.963
And children are free all day?
- Yes, yes.

02:24.087 --> 02:25.918
Tell me about it again.

02:26.327 --> 02:29.683
Wages are so incredibly high,
that kids don't have to work.

02:30.087 --> 02:31.839
They don't work?

02:32.207 --> 02:34.482
And they can play all day?

02:34.647 --> 02:35.523
Yes.

03:36.127 --> 03:37.242
Don't worry.

03:38.767 --> 03:39.677
Over there.

03:42.727 --> 03:43.762
They won't fool me.

03:45.567 --> 03:47.683
Shouldn't take the first offer.

04:01.327 --> 04:02.316
Over there.

04:05.487 --> 04:06.886
Your papers, your papers.

04:08.647 --> 04:09.636
Here.

04:10.887 --> 04:11.797
He's my son.

04:11.967 --> 04:13.878
Is your wife with you?
- She's dead.

04:14.807 --> 04:16.035
We're from Tommelilla.

04:34.487 --> 04:37.718
Lasse Karlsson from Tommelilla.
I'm offering you my services.

04:42.887 --> 04:45.196
That one looks like he'd
be kind to children.

04:48.487 --> 04:49.476
Hello.

04:49.807 --> 04:53.277
Lasse Karlsson from Tommelilla.
I'm offering you my services.

04:54.887 --> 04:57.321
You should have stayed
in Sweden, you' re too old.

05:07.647 --> 05:08.602
Hello.

05:09.007 --> 05:12.522
I'm Lasse Karlsson from
Tommelilla, I'm offering...

05:13.647 --> 05:15.683
I'm not gonna take the first offer.

05:24.087 --> 05:27.443
Lasse Karlsson from Tommelilla.
I'm offering my services.

05:54.127 --> 05:57.881
Lasse Karlsson from Tommelilla.
I'm offering my services.

05:58.047 --> 06:00.277
You're too old, and the
boy is too young.

06:05.407 --> 06:08.319
Pelle, I'm not gonna
take the first offer.

06:09.847 --> 06:11.280
No.

06:43.687 --> 06:45.120
You're too late.

06:47.967 --> 06:49.798
You were on the boat from Sweden?

06:52.447 --> 06:53.846
Where are your parents?

07:21.967 --> 07:24.117
Hello, Lasse Karlsson
from Tomelilla.

07:24.287 --> 07:25.686
I'm offering my...
- Let me see your papers.

07:39.887 --> 07:43.118
I'll pay you 100 crowns a year.
Including the boy, your son.

08:46.087 --> 08:48.043
Dear sweet Jesus!

08:52.767 --> 08:54.041
You'll sleep in there.

09:00.287 --> 09:02.676
Any questions ask me
or my assistance.

10:02.847 --> 10:04.360
Stop doing that!

10:04.927 --> 10:06.246
Come back here!

10:06.807 --> 10:07.922
Stupid animals!

10:08.287 --> 10:09.481
You'll get me in trouble!

10:09.887 --> 10:10.842
You won't get away from me.

10:11.047 --> 10:12.958
You dumb beast!
Do what I tell you!

10:14.847 --> 10:16.360
That's it. Move it!

10:19.607 --> 10:22.724
You gotta learn how to treat them.
Hit them on their teats.

10:24.087 --> 10:25.805
The teats or their hind legs.

10:32.687 --> 10:33.597
Hit them!

10:34.927 --> 10:36.758
Keep moving, I said, keep moving!

10:42.767 --> 10:44.837
Stupid cows.
- Keep moving.

10:51.847 --> 10:53.405
If you help me with the cows...

10:53.927 --> 10:55.838
...and teach me danish...

10:57.127 --> 10:59.118
...I' II share my food with you.

11:00.727 --> 11:02.001
Always carry a stone.

11:02.327 --> 11:05.478
If a cow runs away,
you throw it at her.

11:06.287 --> 11:07.402
You take a good stone.

11:07.887 --> 11:09.559
You throw it and you call her name.

11:09.727 --> 11:10.762
Then, she'll come back.

11:11.207 --> 11:13.402
She'll know who's boss.
- What's your name?

11:13.567 --> 11:14.477
Rud.

11:15.447 --> 11:16.436
Rut?

11:17.327 --> 11:18.840
Rud. With the tongue.

11:19.887 --> 11:21.878
Rud, Rud.

11:23.327 --> 11:24.726
If you put your head
between your legs...

11:24.887 --> 11:26.878
...and the sub is above the trees...

11:27.367 --> 11:29.119
...it's time to give them water.

11:29.287 --> 11:31.278
The larks' song will tell you too.

11:31.767 --> 11:32.677
Rut!

11:33.687 --> 11:34.915
That's my mother.

11:35.927 --> 11:37.519
She can't say Rud either.

11:38.247 --> 11:39.157
Rut!

11:39.367 --> 11:40.959
Here's the food I promised.

11:41.807 --> 11:42.876
Rut!

11:55.687 --> 11:56.915
Stablehand!

11:57.647 --> 11:59.558
Why's that cow standing there?

12:00.767 --> 12:02.200
Why's Gabriella there?

12:08.407 --> 12:10.204
Why's Gabriella there?

12:12.007 --> 12:14.157
The girls can't find their cows,
when you move them around.

12:16.407 --> 12:18.045
Aspasia, can't you read?

12:18.807 --> 12:20.035
Just as it's written.

12:20.447 --> 12:22.756
As-pe-sia.

12:25.807 --> 12:28.002
You're saying there's a difference...

12:28.167 --> 12:29.998
...where the cows stand?

12:36.087 --> 12:37.202
Kongstrup is back.

12:55.247 --> 12:56.157
Erik!

12:57.607 --> 12:59.677
Why haven't you unharnessed
the horses?

13:02.287 --> 13:04.357
Because I want to eat
my food first.

13:05.407 --> 13:06.635
What do you say?

13:07.767 --> 13:10.406
I say you unharness those
horses right now.

13:11.047 --> 13:11.923
Come on!

13:12.127 --> 13:15.802
Those horses are more
important than your stomach.

13:58.847 --> 14:01.042
Do you know the punishment
for stealing milk?

14:02.607 --> 14:03.756
You could be whipped for it.

14:05.887 --> 14:07.684
I won't report you this time.

14:18.047 --> 14:20.800
Hey Pelle... I've been thinking.

14:21.887 --> 14:22.956
I like you.

14:23.607 --> 14:25.325
So I'll say you a secret.

14:25.567 --> 14:28.035
I know where you can find
a lot of gold coins.

14:28.207 --> 14:30.038
But you got to keep it secret.

14:31.927 --> 14:33.440
A real secret. You promise?

14:39.927 --> 14:42.316
Come in here, Pelle, very quietly.

14:43.807 --> 14:46.162
The raven can be
dangerous if it hears us.

14:48.287 --> 14:49.276
Come.

15:13.527 --> 15:14.755
Where are you?

15:18.127 --> 15:19.560
Sir!

15:20.767 --> 15:21.836
Are you here?

15:25.007 --> 15:26.326
Are you here?

16:00.047 --> 16:00.957
Jump!

16:01.447 --> 16:03.915
Jump, you stinking Swede!

16:06.487 --> 16:07.397
Jump!

16:10.047 --> 16:12.880
You dirty bastard!

16:13.047 --> 16:14.275
Do you like it?
- Help!

16:14.447 --> 16:15.357
That's enough!

16:15.647 --> 16:18.036
I'll turn you both in
to the authorities!

16:18.287 --> 16:19.356
I said that's enough!

16:19.527 --> 16:21.358
You, son of a bitch!
- Help!

16:21.527 --> 16:23.119
Erik! I'm warning you!

16:23.367 --> 16:26.598
I'll turn you in!

16:31.607 --> 16:33.279
Get out of here fast.

16:33.567 --> 16:35.478
You're lucky I was
here to save you.

16:35.647 --> 16:36.841
Get going.

17:01.007 --> 17:03.646
He'll be punished. You can be sure.

17:04.127 --> 17:05.958
On my word of honor.

17:06.686 --> 17:08.483
I promise you I'II...
- Kill him!

17:09.446 --> 17:11.358
Kill that filthy bastard.

17:12.166 --> 17:15.000
You really gonna do it?
- I' ve given you my word.

17:15.406 --> 17:17.125
How?
- How?

17:18.166 --> 17:19.486
How are you gonna kill him?

17:23.367 --> 17:24.435
With a hammer, I think.

17:24.967 --> 17:26.685
Knock out his brains?
- Yes.

17:26.887 --> 17:28.036
You'll really do it?

17:28.487 --> 17:30.443
He's just good as dead.

17:33.047 --> 17:36.403
But who'll read
the cows' names then?

17:40.167 --> 17:41.202
You're right.

17:43.847 --> 17:44.916
Yes.

17:46.127 --> 17:47.958
We'd better settle for a whipping.

17:49.527 --> 17:51.802
Then he can still read for us.

17:53.247 --> 17:55.556
But it'll be a proper whipping,
that he'll never forgot.

18:07.487 --> 18:09.876
Yarn for the boy's grey socks.

18:10.127 --> 18:11.879
The patch was for...
What did she say?

18:12.207 --> 18:15.085
The Sunday sweater.

18:16.087 --> 18:18.078
Your mother said...

18:18.287 --> 18:21.120
...the sleeves should be let down.

18:21.287 --> 18:22.436
And...

18:23.447 --> 18:24.641
Your mother was...

18:24.807 --> 18:27.719
She was so worried before she died.

18:28.247 --> 18:30.363
She didn't think I could
take care of you.

18:31.447 --> 18:33.836
Don't let him wear the socks too long

18:34.647 --> 18:35.875
Don't let him wear them through.

18:36.047 --> 18:37.196
Lasse!

18:37.887 --> 18:39.115
Lasse!

18:50.887 --> 18:52.036
It's him.

18:55.847 --> 18:58.042
Where are you, you Swedish bumpkin?

18:58.887 --> 19:00.400
Are you going to do it now?

19:02.727 --> 19:04.080
Yes, yes.

19:21.407 --> 19:24.956
Sir, I want to protest
what you did to my son.

19:25.687 --> 19:26.961
I want to protest...
- Why...

19:27.127 --> 19:27.877
...don't you answer when I call?

19:30.567 --> 19:33.001
Sir, I want...

19:33.927 --> 19:36.043
I want to protest about
the way Pelle...

19:36.207 --> 19:37.526
...was...
- You want trouble?

19:37.687 --> 19:39.359
I can report you to the manager.

19:45.967 --> 19:48.117
Aspasia is not going out
to pasture tomorrow.

19:50.047 --> 19:52.356
Is she going to calve?
- That's right!

19:52.687 --> 19:54.359
Did you think she was foaling?

20:16.647 --> 20:18.524
You can lie there and cry.

20:18.967 --> 20:21.037
But if one can't read
Aspasia's name...

20:21.207 --> 20:22.481
...one ought to show a little respect

20:22.647 --> 20:26.435
I know where's Aspasia.
She's the third one from the door.

20:26.687 --> 20:28.040
You promised, papa!

20:28.727 --> 20:31.287
Knowing that she's the third
one from the door...

20:31.567 --> 20:33.876
Is not at all the same as
reading her name!

20:34.207 --> 20:35.196
You fool!

20:35.527 --> 20:38.758
I'm your father you should
show some respect for me!

20:41.247 --> 20:42.839
Lasse is old and poor.

20:43.847 --> 20:44.962
What's left?

20:45.167 --> 20:46.395
No respect.

20:47.207 --> 20:49.437
They can do what they
want with you.

20:51.287 --> 20:52.561
You're short of breath.

20:53.167 --> 20:55.635
You worry about your heart
and your blood pressure.

20:56.327 --> 20:58.477
That's what getting old is like but...

20:59.087 --> 21:00.884
...you're young, Pelle.

21:01.087 --> 21:03.317
You can still conquer the whole world

21:05.447 --> 21:08.996
Look at that! I nearly forgot,
Look here, Pelle.

21:09.607 --> 21:11.563
Look, look what I have.

21:12.687 --> 21:13.802
See, Pelle.

21:14.327 --> 21:17.160
I forgot.
I brought this from Sweden.

21:20.887 --> 21:22.002
From Tommelilla.

21:24.367 --> 21:25.356
Well.

21:26.887 --> 21:29.640
If we're lucky, we'll get
wild strawberries.

21:36.527 --> 21:39.837
Just think, Pelle.
Real swedish strawberries.

21:53.847 --> 21:55.883
Nils, get some water for your father

22:44.007 --> 22:45.725
Nils, how about that water?

22:53.047 --> 22:54.366
Keep out over there!

23:02.447 --> 23:04.165
Just what do you think you are, Nils?

23:24.367 --> 23:25.561
Where have you been?

23:25.927 --> 23:27.519
Your father's been looking for you.

23:27.687 --> 23:29.518
The missus sent me to the store.

24:15.607 --> 24:18.075
Let's see what you've got
in your jacket Pelle?

24:25.887 --> 24:27.525
She said no one was to know.

24:31.287 --> 24:34.165
You're a good lad, Pelle, come.

24:40.087 --> 24:42.396
If you give me the package,
I'll give it to my wife.

24:46.247 --> 24:47.566
No one else will see it.

25:01.567 --> 25:02.761
Cognac.

25:06.327 --> 25:07.282
It's mine.

25:17.927 --> 25:21.044
I won't move... until
you give it to me.

25:25.447 --> 25:27.563
You bastard, Kongstrup!

25:28.087 --> 25:30.078
I said give me that bottle.

25:30.687 --> 25:33.440
You, Satan! Devil! Pelle...

25:33.607 --> 25:35.916
...go and tell them all
how he bullies me.

25:36.087 --> 25:37.759
How wicked he is, tell them...

25:37.927 --> 25:40.282
...how he's ruining my life!
- It's all a lie!

25:59.847 --> 26:00.836
You'll keep it.

26:17.687 --> 26:19.678
God who keeps his children near.

26:19.847 --> 26:21.803
Look at me who's kneeling here.

26:22.367 --> 26:24.562
My happiness is in God's hands.

26:24.727 --> 26:27.082
Whatever are the world's demands.

26:27.607 --> 26:28.835
Papa.

26:29.087 --> 26:29.997
What?

26:30.167 --> 26:32.044
Tomorrow is the day
after tomorrow?

26:34.207 --> 26:36.243
And the day after
tomorrow is tomorrow?

26:37.287 --> 26:38.356
My birthday.

26:39.887 --> 26:42.117
Yes, yes.

26:46.207 --> 26:49.517
Pelle, was it the real
thing he threw out...

26:50.927 --> 26:52.155
...really cognac?

26:54.287 --> 26:56.403
He poured into the flower pot?

26:58.487 --> 27:01.047
Happiness comes, happiness goes.

27:01.207 --> 27:03.277
My happiness is in God's hands...

27:03.447 --> 27:06.086
...whatever are the world's
demands.

27:30.687 --> 27:32.040
You ought to start moving.

27:32.647 --> 27:34.046
Put your clothes on.

27:36.607 --> 27:38.643
Pants, Pelle, pans first.

27:46.167 --> 27:47.077
But...

27:47.567 --> 27:49.000
...what about your pocket?

27:49.687 --> 27:51.325
There's something in your pocket!

27:52.447 --> 27:55.200
You weren't out stealing
eggs last night, were you?

27:57.287 --> 28:00.245
I'll be very surprised if
that egg isn't broken.

28:09.407 --> 28:10.806
It's only paper.

28:13.247 --> 28:15.886
Why do you stuff your pockets?

28:41.127 --> 28:42.037
It's your day.

28:42.287 --> 28:44.755
Your birthday,
God bless you, son.

28:45.087 --> 28:45.963
Thank you.

28:50.247 --> 28:52.886
It's just a simple gift from
a poor man, Pelle.

29:24.047 --> 29:25.002
Look.

29:27.087 --> 29:29.760
Well, a real beauty!

29:31.887 --> 29:33.366
It's a birthday present.

29:35.447 --> 29:37.642
I should have guessed.

29:38.287 --> 29:41.120
You look like someone
who's having a birthday.

29:41.807 --> 29:42.683
Congratulations.

29:43.527 --> 29:45.882
Happy birthday. It's your day.

29:56.327 --> 29:57.362
They say...

29:57.687 --> 30:00.201
...that you plan to run
away to America.

30:01.887 --> 30:02.842
What?

30:03.607 --> 30:04.960
Run away!

30:05.887 --> 30:07.036
Do I look like an idiot?

30:07.207 --> 30:10.244
You think I'd risk losing
all my savings...

30:10.407 --> 30:12.363
...and be lawless?

30:12.847 --> 30:13.882
No.

30:14.487 --> 30:15.966
I want to be free.

30:16.527 --> 30:17.482
A free man.

30:17.647 --> 30:19.239
That's what I'm waiting for.

30:19.487 --> 30:20.556
That's what I want.

30:22.807 --> 30:24.126
To be free.

30:44.047 --> 30:45.241
Pelle.

30:46.767 --> 30:48.166
I'll show you something.

30:49.727 --> 30:50.716
It's here.

30:55.167 --> 30:56.077
Here.

30:56.887 --> 30:58.957
This is the boat to America.

30:59.127 --> 31:02.039
I've got two years left to
work on this damn farm.

31:02.207 --> 31:03.720
That's all, two years.

31:04.087 --> 31:06.237
Then I'll have enough
money for the ticket.

31:06.727 --> 31:09.400
As soon as the manager pays me...

31:09.807 --> 31:12.002
...I'll go out and conquer the world.

31:13.167 --> 31:14.885
Over the great ocean.

31:16.367 --> 31:17.277
First to America.

31:17.687 --> 31:20.360
China, Spain, Australia.

31:20.727 --> 31:23.366
It's out there, it'll be
mine to conquer.

31:23.767 --> 31:26.486
It's all out there just waiting
to be conquered.

31:27.047 --> 31:28.685
A man can actually live!

31:29.367 --> 31:30.959
It's out there waiting for us.

31:31.327 --> 31:32.806
Take me with you.

31:34.727 --> 31:35.637
Yes!

31:36.767 --> 31:40.043
Because today is your birthday!

31:41.007 --> 31:45.000
Remember. In two years,
when the snow begins to melt...

31:45.487 --> 31:47.603
...we two will sail to America.

31:48.847 --> 31:52.123
You and me will sail to conquer...

31:52.807 --> 31:55.560
...that great wonderful world.

32:32.887 --> 32:33.922
Open.

32:35.487 --> 32:36.840
Surprise!

32:39.167 --> 32:42.159
We've eaten wild strawberries
on all your birthdays.

32:43.647 --> 32:46.684
Just think, real Swedish strawberries

32:49.007 --> 32:50.838
How far is it to America, papa?

32:53.167 --> 32:54.282
America?

32:56.487 --> 33:00.366
It's a long way. You have
to cross an ocean, Pelle.

33:01.727 --> 33:04.241
Erik said that he wants to sail there

33:07.207 --> 33:09.596
He told me it's the strongest
thing there is.

33:10.127 --> 33:12.641
It's soft but it can
hold up anything.

33:15.687 --> 33:17.484
Yes.
- I wonder...

33:18.167 --> 33:19.486
...America and...

33:19.847 --> 33:20.802
...China...

33:22.487 --> 33:24.955
...are they made
something like a boat?

33:25.967 --> 33:27.241
It seems impossible.

33:29.287 --> 33:31.118
Are those countries drifting?

33:31.727 --> 33:33.558
Or are they anchored
to the bottom?

33:36.087 --> 33:38.123
They are anchored.

35:22.927 --> 35:23.962
Kongstrup!

35:25.047 --> 35:26.366
Kongstrup!

35:29.647 --> 35:32.480
Come out, Kongstrup.
I want to talk to you!

35:33.687 --> 35:36.326
Your son is hungry!
- The sow...

35:36.487 --> 35:37.966
...and the cabbagehead.

35:39.887 --> 35:43.562
Kongstrup, your bastard
son needs money for food.

35:44.567 --> 35:47.764
What do you think is going your
cabbagehead to talk about his father?

35:47.927 --> 35:50.760
Come out and say hello to
your bastard son. He's hungry.

35:51.047 --> 35:53.561
That lecher, he has kids
all over the place.

35:53.967 --> 35:54.922
Kongstrup!

35:55.087 --> 35:56.486
Except with his missus.

35:56.647 --> 35:59.036
Your son is hungry!
- They say she is a witch.

35:59.207 --> 36:01.482
The monthly allowance for your son.

36:01.687 --> 36:03.484
Do yo have so many, you forgot?
- Get out!

36:03.727 --> 36:06.116
Get out, sow!
- You'll never take care of us!

36:06.287 --> 36:08.084
Get out!
- He never see his father!

36:08.247 --> 36:10.681
Get out, you disgusting sow!

36:10.847 --> 36:13.156
Kongstrup has to pay his due!

36:13.567 --> 36:17.116
Kongstrup!
- Get out!

36:18.567 --> 36:20.683
You'll never get rid about!

36:39.567 --> 36:40.682
Kongstrup!

36:41.247 --> 36:42.396
Kongstrup!

37:07.687 --> 37:10.406
Take good care of your
slate now, Pelle.

37:11.087 --> 37:14.159
And stay out of the way of the big
boys, until you can handle them.

37:14.367 --> 37:16.278
But if you won't leave you alone...

37:16.487 --> 37:19.240
...you have to be
the one that hits first.

37:20.447 --> 37:23.564
But when you hit, hit hard.

37:24.687 --> 37:27.155
Listen to everything the teacher says

37:27.327 --> 37:28.476
And don't make trouble.

37:29.607 --> 37:32.485
When you blow your nose,
use your handkerchief.

37:32.687 --> 37:34.325
Do not use your fingers.

37:34.927 --> 37:35.837
But...

37:36.287 --> 37:37.766
...if you're sure that
no one's looking...

37:37.927 --> 37:40.487
...then you can save
on the handkerchief.

37:41.927 --> 37:44.361
Take care of your sweater,
now that I've mended it.

37:44.607 --> 37:46.677
If the teacher's wife invites
you to coffee...

37:46.847 --> 37:49.566
...take only one piece of cake.

37:49.767 --> 37:51.041
She's not gonna do it.

37:51.207 --> 37:52.162
Why not?

37:52.327 --> 37:54.045
Because the teacher hasn't got a wife

37:55.167 --> 37:57.362
That's the better.

37:57.687 --> 37:58.597
Go on.

38:01.327 --> 38:03.682
B-A says BA.

38:03.847 --> 38:06.361
B-E says BE.

38:06.527 --> 38:09.041
B-A...

38:09.367 --> 38:11.358
...says BA.

38:11.767 --> 38:13.883
B-E...

38:14.047 --> 38:15.719
...says BE.

38:16.127 --> 38:19.164
B-I says BI.

38:19.487 --> 38:22.479
B-O says BO.

38:22.847 --> 38:25.805
B-U says BU.

38:26.087 --> 38:29.397
B-Y says BY.

38:29.727 --> 38:33.481
B-A says BAH!

38:33.767 --> 38:35.041
You miserable brats.

38:35.207 --> 38:37.767
Stop it at once I tell you!

38:37.927 --> 38:40.395
I'll teach each and every
one of you a lesson!

38:40.607 --> 38:43.440
Silence! Silence in the classroom!

38:51.687 --> 38:54.076
Silence! Bunch of barbarians!

38:59.447 --> 39:00.960
He have here a new boy.

39:01.407 --> 39:03.318
We must welcome him.

39:06.847 --> 39:08.075
Stand up.

39:09.607 --> 39:11.199
Tell us your name.

39:11.527 --> 39:12.755
Pelle Karlsson.

39:14.607 --> 39:16.404
And what are you good at?

39:17.527 --> 39:20.997
I can make a cow obey me
just by throwing stones at her.

39:21.167 --> 39:22.395
What an ass is he!

39:22.927 --> 39:24.280
And I can make my cows stand...

39:24.447 --> 39:26.244
...still by buzzing like a wasp.
- Swedish.

39:26.407 --> 39:29.080
I can tell time by using the sun.
- Can you read?

39:29.367 --> 39:31.597
No, that's why I've come here.

39:33.447 --> 39:35.961
I don't care for your
insolence and sarcasm.

39:37.607 --> 39:40.565
B-A says BA.

39:40.767 --> 39:43.520
B-E says BE.

39:43.727 --> 39:46.764
B-I says BI.

39:48.647 --> 39:49.557
This one, here.

39:49.887 --> 39:52.321
You told me but I forgot.
What did you call it?

39:52.927 --> 39:55.157
Have you already forgotten?

39:55.487 --> 39:57.921
I remembered after seeing it once.

39:58.847 --> 39:59.882
It's an F.

40:00.567 --> 40:03.365
That's what it is.

40:03.767 --> 40:05.837
What's wrong with my head today?

40:06.127 --> 40:08.163
F, F.

40:08.687 --> 40:10.166
What do you think it's used for?

40:12.847 --> 40:14.838
It's the first letter in f-ternoon.

40:15.087 --> 40:16.839
F-ternoon, papa.

40:17.207 --> 40:18.322
That's right.

40:18.727 --> 40:21.116
But your didn't figure that out alone

40:21.287 --> 40:23.118
The teacher must have told you.
- No.

40:23.287 --> 40:24.606
I figured it out myself.

40:25.807 --> 40:28.879
You did you're getting clever, Pelle.

40:29.767 --> 40:32.918
There's no end to what a boy with
so much book learning can do.

41:56.287 --> 41:59.962
Maybe we'll get roast pork
with raisins, Pelle.

42:01.407 --> 42:02.726
Or with apples.

42:03.127 --> 42:06.483
They also make it with
apples instead of with raisins.

42:08.927 --> 42:11.282
We'll see.

42:15.887 --> 42:18.355
Get out. I don't want any
more trouble with you!

42:19.527 --> 42:21.677
Herring on Christmas Eve!

42:21.967 --> 42:23.719
I didn't expect that given from you!

42:23.887 --> 42:26.321
If you don't like the food,
then find some other place.

42:26.487 --> 42:28.284
It will be a pleasure
to lose sight of you.

42:28.487 --> 42:30.557
Herring, herring
every single day!

42:30.727 --> 42:32.479
Couldn't we have had
roast pork for Christmas?

42:32.647 --> 42:35.923
A real Christmas dinner?
- Damn you, always complaining!

42:36.127 --> 42:39.563
If you don't like it in this country,
go back to Sweden!

42:40.047 --> 42:42.880
You're so damn stingy!

42:43.207 --> 42:45.198
Don't you think we work hard enough?

42:45.367 --> 42:47.927
And you of all people say that to me!

42:48.127 --> 42:49.082
Go to your quarters!

42:49.967 --> 42:50.922
Go to hell!

42:51.727 --> 42:53.285
Go to hell with you!

42:54.887 --> 42:56.400
Go to hell with your farm!

42:58.207 --> 43:00.243
Go to hell with you and your farm!

43:00.567 --> 43:01.886
Go to hell!

43:07.247 --> 43:08.680
Any other complaints here?

45:47.167 --> 45:48.282
What are you doing here?

45:48.447 --> 45:51.120
Why don't you go back
to where you came from?

45:51.287 --> 45:54.438
Yellow-belly!
Why don't you stay with your own kind

46:14.967 --> 46:18.323
Get lost, Pelle. You might
fall in the icy water.

46:21.647 --> 46:23.080
Go home, Pelle!

46:26.247 --> 46:29.284
You are a yellow-belly!
- So quit following us around.

46:36.247 --> 46:37.680
Go home to your mama!

46:37.847 --> 46:39.121
I can't my mama is dead!

46:39.287 --> 46:40.800
Can you prove you're not
a yellow-belly?

46:40.967 --> 46:42.719
Yes, I'll jump into that water.

47:51.567 --> 47:53.000
You must be crazy...

47:53.167 --> 47:55.078
...jumping into the water like...

47:55.887 --> 47:57.400
...some love sick woman!

47:59.127 --> 48:00.958
Just a show those kids!

48:01.207 --> 48:04.199
A good beating is
what you deserve, Pelle.

48:04.727 --> 48:06.126
If you had drowned...

48:06.847 --> 48:09.520
...I'd have given you such a beating
you'd had sit down for a month.

48:09.687 --> 48:11.643
Because if you had done it,
it would have been your fault.

48:13.887 --> 48:15.002
Doctor...

48:15.767 --> 48:16.722
...you could...

48:17.167 --> 48:19.635
...you could use this if you
want to take some blood.

48:34.487 --> 48:35.476
Drink this.

48:36.687 --> 48:37.881
It will help your cold.

48:44.887 --> 48:46.286
Don't be afraid, Pelle.

48:47.367 --> 48:48.561
I'm not a witch.

48:50.367 --> 48:51.516
Just very...

48:52.087 --> 48:53.725
...Ionely at times.

48:56.807 --> 48:58.001
Oh dear God!

49:00.567 --> 49:02.239
You don't even have a mother.

49:03.167 --> 49:04.156
Do yo?

49:05.207 --> 49:06.925
It's three years since mama died.

49:08.967 --> 49:11.561
She's lying in the lefthand side
of the church cemetery.

49:13.127 --> 49:14.526
Do you miss her much?

49:17.687 --> 49:19.325
Lasse mends my clothes.

49:20.847 --> 49:22.360
She was a good mother, wasn't she?

49:25.527 --> 49:27.802
She was so ill and grouchy at the end

49:28.647 --> 49:30.160
And she used to be so happy.

49:32.087 --> 49:33.520
But he'll marry again soon.

49:34.727 --> 49:36.877
If Lasse can find a woman.

49:38.767 --> 49:40.598
And then you'll go away.

49:43.767 --> 49:45.405
The workers all hate it here.

49:47.407 --> 49:49.159
It's as we were God forsaken.

49:50.687 --> 49:52.200
As if we were cursed.

49:53.927 --> 49:55.155
The earth is bloody.

49:56.967 --> 49:58.241
Is that what they say?

49:59.567 --> 50:00.522
Yes.

50:03.447 --> 50:04.960
And what do they say about me?

50:07.087 --> 50:09.043
That missus has a pact with the devil

50:09.207 --> 50:11.402
And turns into a werewolf at night.

50:15.447 --> 50:16.766
It's the price you pay...

50:17.527 --> 50:19.483
...giving your heart to
the wrong man.

50:25.087 --> 50:26.759
If he knew the anguish...

50:27.727 --> 50:30.366
...the suffering that he
causes with his lechery.

50:32.047 --> 50:34.003
He's in town again.

50:34.287 --> 50:35.640
Why does he do this to me?

50:35.807 --> 50:37.923
I married him, made him a proprietor.

50:38.087 --> 50:39.042
Gave him my love.

50:39.207 --> 50:41.038
The best I have, I've given him.

50:41.207 --> 50:44.119
If he could have given me a child.
- I really have to go.

50:44.847 --> 50:46.599
Now you're afraid of me again.

50:49.847 --> 50:51.326
You're a good boy, Pelle.

50:53.647 --> 50:55.080
If I had a son...

50:55.927 --> 50:58.077
...he would be like you.

51:51.807 --> 51:53.001
Come.

52:11.287 --> 52:13.243
And this is where we keep the cows.

52:14.567 --> 52:16.364
Papa, it's the missus.

52:16.847 --> 52:18.200
It's the missus
with the young lady.

52:18.367 --> 52:19.402
My God!

52:22.247 --> 52:24.283
Pelle, go forward.

52:29.367 --> 52:31.278
Pelle, where's your father?

52:36.687 --> 52:40.521
This is our cattleman, Lasse
Karlsson and his son Pelle.

52:40.687 --> 52:42.006
Hello.

52:45.487 --> 52:48.843
This is Miss Signe,
my niece from Copenhagen.

52:49.527 --> 52:51.404
She will be staying with us now.

52:51.567 --> 52:52.477
Hello.

53:24.927 --> 53:26.804
I've forgotten what 2 times 2 are.

53:29.407 --> 53:31.762
May be I'm a bit rusty
on the subject...

53:31.927 --> 53:33.838
...but I think the answer is
the same as in addition.

53:35.487 --> 53:37.205
2 and 2 are 5.

53:43.407 --> 53:46.683
What's lighter? A ton
of feathers or a ton of lead?

53:47.887 --> 53:49.320
Now you!
- Sit down.

53:51.327 --> 53:54.763
If you don't mind I'd like to hear
that question again, Pelle.

53:54.967 --> 53:56.082
Repeat, please.

53:56.647 --> 53:59.719
Which is lighter? A ton of
feathers or a ton of lead?

54:54.047 --> 54:56.038
Well, what have we here?

54:58.207 --> 54:59.606
Where is the herring?

55:00.327 --> 55:01.646
I eat nothing but herring.

55:05.327 --> 55:07.477
Do you know the difference
between you and a buttock?

55:07.647 --> 55:08.762
No.
- No?

55:09.847 --> 55:11.565
I don't know either.

55:15.247 --> 55:17.158
Erik, did you hear what I asked?

55:17.327 --> 55:18.726
I'm ask for a favour, Lasse.

55:18.887 --> 55:21.526
Can you take my place
at the chaff-cutter tonight?

55:22.007 --> 55:23.235
But it's saturday.

55:23.687 --> 55:26.645
Yes, I wanna get
a bit of... you know. Will you?

55:26.807 --> 55:29.241
Yes.
- No, not so fast.

55:36.327 --> 55:37.760
He's got a way with women.

55:38.047 --> 55:39.196
Like his papa.

55:39.367 --> 55:41.835
It must be a hell of a long
time ago, Karlsson.

55:43.247 --> 55:45.078
It's a real good idea, Karna.

55:45.727 --> 55:46.921
Really.

55:47.287 --> 55:48.925
You like Pelle.

55:49.247 --> 55:51.078
You've always been good to the boy.

55:51.527 --> 55:53.358
Why not move together.

55:53.887 --> 55:56.003
We could be really happy.

55:56.847 --> 55:58.041
You're too old, Lasse.

55:58.367 --> 56:00.927
My man has to be dangerous.

56:01.127 --> 56:02.685
You're not dangerous anymore.

56:03.327 --> 56:04.521
I see.

56:04.967 --> 56:06.366
I see.

56:07.287 --> 56:09.005
So you're out fishing for young men.

56:10.727 --> 56:12.877
Watch out you don't miss the boat.

56:16.087 --> 56:17.759
Lasse, do us a favor.

56:17.927 --> 56:20.839
Get us some brandy.
- What?

56:21.007 --> 56:22.918
If you want brandy,
you can go and get it.

56:23.847 --> 56:25.758
Just because someone is old!

56:25.967 --> 56:27.764
That used to be respect!

56:28.167 --> 56:31.045
"Lasse", the girls would say.
"I want Lasse Karlsson."

56:32.367 --> 56:35.484
Eventhough you were married,
the girls were chasing you.

56:36.007 --> 56:37.520
There was respect.

56:44.527 --> 56:45.516
Papa!

56:49.287 --> 56:50.481
I'm sorry.

56:51.487 --> 56:53.796
I had hoped when we left Sweden...

56:53.967 --> 56:56.686
...that there will be some
money that cover...

56:57.007 --> 56:58.520
...enough to buy a little house.

56:59.967 --> 57:03.277
And maybe find a woman,
who could take care of us.

57:06.287 --> 57:09.677
Then, we could have coffee
in bed sunday mornings.

57:10.207 --> 57:11.606
We could run away.

57:12.607 --> 57:14.040
Run to somewhere, far.

57:14.647 --> 57:15.557
¿Run away?

57:16.567 --> 57:19.639
But think of the authorities. I don't
want to become an outlaw.

57:19.807 --> 57:20.523
I know the way.

57:21.447 --> 57:22.277
To América.

57:22.447 --> 57:25.405
¡America!
- America, across the ocean.

57:26.087 --> 57:28.840
They don't follow anybody that far.

57:32.127 --> 57:33.321
We'll get away.

57:58.687 --> 58:00.006
What are you doing?

58:07.007 --> 58:08.440
Stealing eggs. I was hungry.

58:08.607 --> 58:10.723
For God's sake,
don't tell anyone you saw me.

58:16.887 --> 58:18.366
I know who the father is.

58:36.367 --> 58:38.756
You've got to swear
that you tell no one.

58:41.807 --> 58:42.956
His father...

58:44.367 --> 58:46.164
If he found out I don't
know what he would...

58:47.887 --> 58:49.525
To his father a Swedish woman...

58:51.087 --> 58:52.759
...is only a worker.

58:54.127 --> 58:56.516
For the love of God,
don't tell anyone.

58:57.167 --> 58:59.761
I've got to hide in here
until my time comes.

58:59.967 --> 59:00.922
Understand?

59:13.767 --> 59:14.802
Pelle!

59:17.047 --> 59:18.162
Come here!

59:21.807 --> 59:23.206
What were you doing in the henhouse?

59:23.647 --> 59:24.682
Stealing eggs.

59:24.847 --> 59:25.757
Come.

59:26.247 --> 59:27.157
Bend.

01:00:13.767 --> 01:00:15.439
Pelle, can I have that coin?

01:00:15.607 --> 01:00:16.596
My crown?

01:00:16.767 --> 01:00:18.086
You're really out of your head.

01:00:19.007 --> 01:00:21.123
I need it for when I go to America.

01:00:22.767 --> 01:00:25.156
I'll pay you 10 crown
when I get grown.

01:00:25.327 --> 01:00:26.601
You'll not grow.

01:00:27.527 --> 01:00:28.846
Your body is unnatural.

01:00:31.527 --> 01:00:33.916
I could be an attraction
in a circus at carnival.

01:00:35.767 --> 01:00:36.802
At carnival?

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:39.800
Yes, as a monster,
I coud be rich.

01:00:46.207 --> 01:00:50.041
What about of letting you
beat me 100 times with nettles.

01:00:50.687 --> 01:00:52.405
A 100 good ones. How would that be?

01:00:54.407 --> 01:00:55.556
Me beat you?

01:00:56.687 --> 01:00:57.802
¿ What do you say?

01:00:59.127 --> 01:01:01.436
You couldn't take it.
- Is it a deal?

01:01:11.047 --> 01:01:12.082
Are you ready?

01:01:32.087 --> 01:01:35.079
No more! No more!

01:01:35.607 --> 01:01:37.086
You don't want I get pay!

01:01:38.087 --> 01:01:39.406
You hit too hard!

01:01:41.647 --> 01:01:43.080
Make up your mind.

01:01:43.247 --> 01:01:44.441
The money first.

01:02:41.487 --> 01:02:44.718
Can you tell us anything about
Adam and Eve and the serpent?

01:02:47.247 --> 01:02:49.920
Well, we're all waiting.

01:02:52.367 --> 01:02:55.165
Have you never heard of Adam
and Eve and the serpent?

01:02:59.647 --> 01:03:01.478
Haven't you been listening in class?

01:03:03.687 --> 01:03:05.803
What did the serpent
promise Adam and Eve...

01:03:05.967 --> 01:03:08.356
...if they disobeyed God and ate of
the forbidden fruit?

01:03:13.647 --> 01:03:15.683
You don't know what
the serpent promised them?

01:03:17.287 --> 01:03:20.040
The snake in the garden
convinced them that they would...

01:03:20.407 --> 01:03:22.762
...would indeed be
equal to almightly God.

01:03:24.007 --> 01:03:26.475
I don't see how can we let you
continue with the class...

01:03:26.647 --> 01:03:29.081
...when the children don't
understand the basic tenets.

01:03:30.967 --> 01:03:31.922
Are his parents here?

01:03:39.447 --> 01:03:41.165
His parents are not in attendance.

01:03:41.767 --> 01:03:43.166
You may take you seat.

01:03:44.167 --> 01:03:45.122
Next.

01:03:45.607 --> 01:03:46.596
Pelle.

01:03:55.527 --> 01:03:58.280
Perhaps you can tell us
what God said to the serpent?

01:03:59.407 --> 01:04:00.806
And God said that...

01:04:01.767 --> 01:04:02.722
That...

01:04:05.887 --> 01:04:09.038
God said that the serpent
must crawl on its belly.

01:04:10.487 --> 01:04:12.717
They shall crawl on their belly.

01:04:16.767 --> 01:04:18.246
And does it still do so?

01:04:18.647 --> 01:04:20.399
Yes. It hasn't any limbs.

01:04:21.007 --> 01:04:23.396
And can you tell me what a limb is?

01:04:23.887 --> 01:04:26.082
A limb is...

01:04:28.207 --> 01:04:29.435
...a hand, for example.

01:04:29.607 --> 01:04:30.835
Very good.

01:04:31.247 --> 01:04:34.080
What distinguishes a limb...

01:04:34.247 --> 01:04:35.726
...from other parts of the body?

01:04:40.367 --> 01:04:41.197
A limb moves...

01:04:41.367 --> 01:04:43.722
...independently of
the rest of the body.

01:04:45.047 --> 01:04:47.720
Can you provide the others in
the class with an example?

01:04:57.247 --> 01:04:58.646
Ears.

01:05:00.287 --> 01:05:02.721
Can you move your ears?
- Yes.

01:05:03.447 --> 01:05:05.244
I should really like to see that.

01:05:21.847 --> 01:05:23.838
So your ears saved you.

01:05:24.007 --> 01:05:26.396
I always told you to use your ears.

01:05:36.927 --> 01:05:37.803
Rud!

01:05:40.767 --> 01:05:41.961
Rud!

01:05:42.807 --> 01:05:43.956
Rud!

01:05:45.647 --> 01:05:47.558
Rud! You idiot! Come back!

01:05:50.607 --> 01:05:51.926
You'll never get a heaven!

01:05:53.047 --> 01:05:55.003
You'll never see your
grandma in heaven!

01:06:01.287 --> 01:06:03.517
You can have my slate
if you come back.

01:06:12.607 --> 01:06:14.245
You can't do that to me!

01:06:16.287 --> 01:06:18.517
No! No!

01:08:00.367 --> 01:08:01.482
Don't touch that stone!

01:08:04.767 --> 01:08:06.041
The child is laying there.

01:08:06.247 --> 01:08:08.203
In the bloody earth under the stone.

01:08:09.607 --> 01:08:10.801
Yes he is.

01:08:11.367 --> 01:08:14.040
Ana killed the child and
now she is in prison!

01:08:18.327 --> 01:08:20.158
The crime is on my soul.

01:08:22.886 --> 01:08:24.161
I murdered the child.

01:08:28.687 --> 01:08:30.917
Natural fathers wouldn't do that.

01:08:31.807 --> 01:08:33.524
Lasse would never
have done that to me.

01:08:39.407 --> 01:08:41.078
Why don't you go and leave me alone?

01:08:42.407 --> 01:08:43.965
I see in the night!

01:08:44.127 --> 01:08:45.799
A bonfire you can see from miles!

01:08:46.327 --> 01:08:47.919
Its soul burns on the rocks at night.

01:08:48.087 --> 01:08:51.078
You musn't say that.
You must not lie before God.

01:08:51.846 --> 01:08:53.166
The boy is lying up in the church...

01:08:53.327 --> 01:08:56.238
...in consecrated earth.
- Its soul is under the rocks.

01:08:56.407 --> 01:08:58.841
I've seen it burning on
the rocks at night!

01:08:59.006 --> 01:09:00.804
And the reason is that he
was baptized too late.

01:09:00.966 --> 01:09:03.276
God won't let him into heaven.

01:09:34.087 --> 01:09:35.042
Nils!

01:10:08.527 --> 01:10:10.836
Who has gone out there
into the arms of death?

01:10:11.167 --> 01:10:13.806
It's Nils. He went out with the line.

01:10:38.887 --> 01:10:41.162
Let's take him out!

01:11:17.007 --> 01:11:18.725
Let's get him over there!

01:12:27.847 --> 01:12:30.315
Your eyes are young.
Can you see Nils?

01:12:42.527 --> 01:12:45.360
Blessed is the earth.

01:12:45.687 --> 01:12:48.759
Blessed is our god in heaven...

01:12:48.927 --> 01:12:51.805
The Angels...

01:13:20.887 --> 01:13:22.206
He was a good son.

01:13:23.927 --> 01:13:25.440
He was my everything.

01:13:26.967 --> 01:13:29.845
He was... the fine boy.

01:13:31.887 --> 01:13:34.799
He never spoke an evil
word to me. Not once.

01:13:35.927 --> 01:13:37.963
Even though I denied him his love.

01:13:40.567 --> 01:13:41.920
He was my son.

01:13:43.967 --> 01:13:45.764
And my only one.

01:13:57.767 --> 01:13:59.280
May he find peace now.

01:14:00.287 --> 01:14:02.118
He had so little of it here on earth.

01:14:05.847 --> 01:14:08.361
He sacrificed his life to save others

01:14:09.327 --> 01:14:10.806
Perhaps now, in heaven...

01:14:12.327 --> 01:14:13.555
...you'll be welcome.

01:14:27.367 --> 01:14:28.766
Come on, Erik! Come on!

01:14:31.727 --> 01:14:34.480
Two more inches and you've
won yourself a bottle of brandy.

01:14:42.207 --> 01:14:43.720
He won the brandy!

01:14:43.887 --> 01:14:45.115
When will you drink it?
The foreman says...

01:14:45.287 --> 01:14:46.879
...you have to work tonight.

01:14:47.047 --> 01:14:48.526
Tonight I don't work.

01:14:48.687 --> 01:14:51.599
He'll do it without Erik.
I'll going out to found some fun.

01:14:51.927 --> 01:14:55.761
No one is going to keep me in
when I am getting some fun.

01:14:56.487 --> 01:14:57.886
Can I come with you?

01:14:58.527 --> 01:15:01.246
No, not now, Pelle.

01:15:02.567 --> 01:15:03.795
Not now.

01:15:04.327 --> 01:15:05.555
In one year.

01:15:05.727 --> 01:15:08.799
Across the ocean when
the snow starts to melt...

01:15:08.967 --> 01:15:11.879
...then we'll go out
into the great world.

01:15:12.287 --> 01:15:13.640
First America.

01:15:14.127 --> 01:15:15.276
Then Australia.

01:15:15.887 --> 01:15:17.206
And China.

01:15:18.727 --> 01:15:21.241
Out there's the whole world, Pelle.

01:15:36.767 --> 01:15:38.837
Where are you going you lazy dog?

01:15:39.007 --> 01:15:40.645
You have work to do.

01:15:40.807 --> 01:15:42.035
Erik!

01:15:45.207 --> 01:15:46.242
You had to hear.

01:15:46.407 --> 01:15:47.601
What do you call this?

01:15:48.007 --> 01:15:49.360
I must have the flu.

01:15:50.047 --> 01:15:51.765
My head is spinning like a tap.

01:15:52.167 --> 01:15:55.000
That sounds serious.
Let's have a look at you.

01:15:55.527 --> 01:15:58.803
Look at this, dressed up
in your sunday clothes.

01:15:58.967 --> 01:16:00.605
What's this, your funeral clothes?

01:16:01.447 --> 01:16:03.517
Were you going to buy
yourself a grave?

01:16:04.047 --> 01:16:06.242
It's about time we get
you into the ground.

01:16:06.407 --> 01:16:08.238
You're beginning to smell.

01:16:09.447 --> 01:16:10.562
I'm not dead yet.

01:16:12.687 --> 01:16:15.884
And I don't smell any worse
than some people.

01:16:18.367 --> 01:16:20.722
You're nothing but a lazy
complaining trouble maker.

01:16:20.887 --> 01:16:21.956
I'm sick of you!

01:16:22.127 --> 01:16:23.116
Go ahead, do it again.

01:16:23.287 --> 01:16:26.165
I'm sick of your belly aching.
- Come on, hit me again.

01:16:26.367 --> 01:16:28.597
In front of all these witnesses.

01:16:30.367 --> 01:16:32.676
We'll make a report
to the authorities.

01:16:35.927 --> 01:16:37.121
Get up and go to work...

01:16:38.127 --> 01:16:40.880
...or I'll show you the authorities.

01:17:21.367 --> 01:17:23.403
The foreman wants you to be quiet.

01:17:23.567 --> 01:17:24.636
You're making noise.

01:17:27.967 --> 01:17:29.286
What did you say?

01:17:30.287 --> 01:17:32.118
You're homely!

01:17:33.567 --> 01:17:35.842
The foreman wants you...
- You must speak a little louder.

01:17:36.007 --> 01:17:37.963
I can't hear what you're saying.

01:17:38.127 --> 01:17:40.402
You're making too much noise.

01:17:40.567 --> 01:17:42.125
Too much noise, little chicken?

01:17:42.287 --> 01:17:44.323
You should help us
make too much noise.

01:17:44.487 --> 01:17:46.364
Come on, sing us a little song.

01:17:46.527 --> 01:17:48.916
I wonder if he sings like
a little chicken as well.

01:17:52.727 --> 01:17:56.083
Run back and tell him
to run his own errands.

01:17:57.287 --> 01:17:58.515
Skol!

01:18:00.127 --> 01:18:01.924
Run!

01:18:02.087 --> 01:18:03.202
Skol!

01:18:05.527 --> 01:18:07.199
Run to the fuck foreman!

01:18:13.247 --> 01:18:14.726
I'm not dead yet.

01:18:16.287 --> 01:18:18.005
Not yet.

01:19:37.967 --> 01:19:39.446
Where are you going, Erik?

01:19:39.887 --> 01:19:40.797
To rest.

01:19:41.407 --> 01:19:42.396
What's that word?

01:19:43.207 --> 01:19:44.401
Rest.

01:19:45.527 --> 01:19:48.280
No, you can't rest now.
You'll get back in job.

01:19:49.207 --> 01:19:51.243
You're after me again.
- After you?

01:19:51.727 --> 01:19:52.876
What makes you think that?

01:19:53.487 --> 01:19:55.125
The others are resting.

01:19:55.527 --> 01:19:56.676
Yes, they are resting.

01:19:57.327 --> 01:19:59.158
You get back in the job.

01:20:01.167 --> 01:20:04.443
I'm always the one you pick on.
- You're feeling hurt!

01:20:06.567 --> 01:20:07.841
That's because you're so clever.

01:20:09.087 --> 01:20:10.805
For all the kind words
that you say...

01:20:11.447 --> 01:20:12.960
...when my back is turned up.

01:20:18.727 --> 01:20:20.957
What the hell do you think
your getting paid for?

01:20:21.887 --> 01:20:25.880
Are you so stupid to think
you are on a paid vacation?

01:20:27.167 --> 01:20:29.727
Get out to work right now!

01:20:29.887 --> 01:20:31.764
You lousy bastard.

01:20:37.927 --> 01:20:38.916
All right.

01:20:39.887 --> 01:20:42.082
You can turn into the authorities.

01:20:42.447 --> 01:20:44.039
And you won't get a single crown more

01:20:44.207 --> 01:20:45.799
Not a crown, Erik.

01:20:46.767 --> 01:20:47.961
You're all done.

01:21:51.687 --> 01:21:53.996
Lasse! They're coming.

01:22:14.407 --> 01:22:15.522
Good Lord.

01:22:16.047 --> 01:22:17.446
They're going to do it.

01:23:35.287 --> 01:23:36.402
Put him in the cellar.

01:23:46.887 --> 01:23:49.355
You heard me, put him in the cellar!

01:24:00.647 --> 01:24:02.285
The rest of you go back to work.

01:25:08.687 --> 01:25:10.166
Come inside and get warm.

01:25:10.327 --> 01:25:12.363
Thank you, it's a strong wind.

01:25:22.207 --> 01:25:23.526
Then mama died.

01:25:23.967 --> 01:25:27.164
And now she's in the cemetery
back home, in Tommelilla.

01:25:28.167 --> 01:25:29.919
So your father is a widower?

01:25:35.087 --> 01:25:36.486
That's the word.

01:25:39.127 --> 01:25:42.403
The sea is hard. My husband
went to sea a year ago.

01:25:42.727 --> 01:25:44.399
I've been like a widow since.

01:25:48.567 --> 01:25:50.125
Has he drowned?

01:25:52.647 --> 01:25:55.320
I can't say. I haven't
received an omen.

01:26:07.247 --> 01:26:09.636
It's been a year that
she's living all alone?

01:26:10.727 --> 01:26:12.046
That's what she said.

01:26:13.647 --> 01:26:15.478
That's a long time.

01:26:17.287 --> 01:26:18.606
A long time.

01:26:23.887 --> 01:26:25.878
And you told her that your
mother was dead?

01:26:27.167 --> 01:26:28.759
Yes, of course you did.

01:26:45.127 --> 01:26:47.960
This is all we have left
of your mother.

01:26:51.367 --> 01:26:53.244
It's all or nothing now.

01:26:53.887 --> 01:26:55.957
Pelle, could you...

01:26:56.487 --> 01:26:58.284
...visit Mrs. Olson tomorrow
after school...

01:26:58.447 --> 01:26:59.880
...and you can say I send...

01:27:00.127 --> 01:27:01.037
...my...

01:27:01.727 --> 01:27:04.605
...my thanks for taking you in
and treating you so well?

01:27:12.527 --> 01:27:14.199
I got an omen last night.

01:27:15.447 --> 01:27:17.961
In fact you could call
it a kind of vision.

01:27:18.967 --> 01:27:22.118
I dreamt there was a huge
dog standing next to my bed.

01:27:24.167 --> 01:27:26.123
His coat was dripping wet.

01:27:26.727 --> 01:27:29.241
I knew it was the shipdog with
a message for me.

01:27:30.367 --> 01:27:31.641
I got out of bed.

01:27:32.087 --> 01:27:35.397
And outside my window
I saw a ship go down.

01:27:37.127 --> 01:27:39.357
I saw my husband rise to heaven.

01:27:41.647 --> 01:27:43.638
He was dripping wet with saltwater.

01:27:45.607 --> 01:27:47.199
I realized immediately...

01:27:48.447 --> 01:27:50.438
...that the dog was
an omen from him.

01:28:23.407 --> 01:28:24.362
Who's there?

01:28:24.607 --> 01:28:27.167
Pelle's father. Lasse Karlsson.

01:28:58.247 --> 01:28:59.726
You're Pelle's father?

01:29:02.007 --> 01:29:03.679
He's very young your son.

01:29:06.127 --> 01:29:07.765
Come, sit.

01:29:15.647 --> 01:29:16.762
Pelle, was...

01:29:17.287 --> 01:29:18.766
...a late-comer you might say.

01:29:23.487 --> 01:29:25.921
But I can still do a man's work.

01:29:26.327 --> 01:29:27.555
In every way.

01:29:28.687 --> 01:29:29.881
Drink.

01:29:41.887 --> 01:29:44.355
Thanks for the drink.
I must be on my way.

01:29:44.607 --> 01:29:45.676
Eat.

01:29:46.727 --> 01:29:47.682
Eat.

01:29:48.327 --> 01:29:50.602
That's how you get to know
something about a man.

01:29:52.487 --> 01:29:53.681
You've walked a long way.

01:29:54.327 --> 01:29:57.046
I just came by to thank
you for being kind to Pelle.

01:29:57.207 --> 01:29:59.721
No, that's enough talk. Go ahead.

01:30:00.367 --> 01:30:01.516
Please.

01:30:04.887 --> 01:30:07.196
You must have been a
good wife to your husband.

01:30:07.447 --> 01:30:08.641
Yes.

01:30:08.927 --> 01:30:10.076
That's true enough.

01:30:11.367 --> 01:30:14.040
Everything and anything he desired
when he was on dry land.

01:30:15.527 --> 01:30:16.846
But he was ungrateful.

01:30:17.087 --> 01:30:18.645
He became tired of that.

01:30:20.527 --> 01:30:23.325
I don't think my wife would'nt
spoke on that way of me.

01:30:24.287 --> 01:30:27.438
There is a lot to do in a house like
this, if there is a man to help.

01:30:27.607 --> 01:30:28.835
Yes, yes.

01:30:30.127 --> 01:30:31.765
There is only one cow.

01:30:33.287 --> 01:30:34.845
That one could become two.

01:30:37.367 --> 01:30:40.120
I'm only a poor person...

01:30:42.527 --> 01:30:44.358
...but we have decent
clothes, both of us.

01:30:45.967 --> 01:30:47.878
And I've a good pair of hands.

01:30:49.847 --> 01:30:52.122
And you're not be afraid
to use them. Would you?

01:30:52.287 --> 01:30:53.481
Not in the list.

01:30:56.607 --> 01:30:58.086
I'm not afraid of...

01:30:59.887 --> 01:31:03.084
...hot coffee in bed on
sunday morning either.

01:31:10.327 --> 01:31:12.045
Can I think I should have a kiss?

01:31:15.287 --> 01:31:17.642
Yes, you should.

01:31:32.687 --> 01:31:35.281
We look for happiness and
blessings on the three of us.

01:31:36.727 --> 01:31:38.365
You already like the boy.

01:31:45.767 --> 01:31:48.156
You'd better stay for the night.

01:31:55.287 --> 01:31:58.085
But I must be back
before the cows wake up.

01:32:00.047 --> 01:32:01.878
And Pelle's all alone.

01:32:19.527 --> 01:32:22.280
Pelle. ¿ What are you doing here?

01:32:24.287 --> 01:32:26.005
Come on. Come on.

01:32:30.167 --> 01:32:32.078
Everything is arranged.

01:32:32.727 --> 01:32:35.241
We'll have a home and a woman
who'll take care of us.

01:32:35.647 --> 01:32:38.286
Missus Olson. You'll be happy.

01:32:40.767 --> 01:32:44.043
And may be we'll get coffee
in bed on sunday mornings.

01:32:47.967 --> 01:32:49.958
Come, come.

01:32:58.527 --> 01:33:02.486
Give us this day...
- Do you have the biblical stories?

01:33:04.607 --> 01:33:06.916
And God...
- Does it have the one about the man...

01:33:07.087 --> 01:33:09.601
...whose sons pulled down his pants?

01:33:09.967 --> 01:33:11.036
Noah?

01:33:11.487 --> 01:33:14.160
Yes, old man Noah.

01:33:15.567 --> 01:33:18.001
What did he drink, old man Noah?
- Wine.

01:33:18.327 --> 01:33:21.444
Wine! Then he must
have been a rich man.

01:33:23.207 --> 01:33:24.720
Then there was the one...

01:33:25.967 --> 01:33:28.527
...the man who was so devilish clever.
- Which was his name?

01:33:28.687 --> 01:33:30.518
Laban.
- Laban!

01:33:30.687 --> 01:33:32.643
Laban, of course.

01:33:32.807 --> 01:33:34.843
It was Laban, Laban.

01:33:35.847 --> 01:33:36.962
How is it go?

01:33:37.567 --> 01:33:39.876
Could you have two wives then?

01:33:40.047 --> 01:33:41.844
All right, I won't bother
you any more.

01:33:45.207 --> 01:33:47.482
The great prophets. Let me see.

01:33:47.647 --> 01:33:48.841
Let's see.

01:33:49.127 --> 01:33:53.006
Isaiah and Daniel.

01:33:53.327 --> 01:33:54.521
I remember them.

01:33:54.887 --> 01:33:58.118
I remember, if you want to you can
test me about the prophets.

01:33:59.487 --> 01:34:00.397
Let's hear them.

01:34:00.567 --> 01:34:03.445
You better stop reading now.
Otherwise you may lose track.

01:34:03.607 --> 01:34:05.563
There are only four great once.

01:34:11.407 --> 01:34:12.681
Isaiah.

01:34:13.007 --> 01:34:14.122
Come on, papa.

01:34:14.847 --> 01:34:16.838
Well, first I need to concentrate.

01:34:17.487 --> 01:34:19.364
There's Isaiah and Daniel...

01:34:19.687 --> 01:34:22.440
I had them a minute ago,
where they have gone?

01:34:22.727 --> 01:34:24.479
There's Isaiah...

01:34:25.207 --> 01:34:26.526
...Daniel...

01:34:30.887 --> 01:34:33.117
It's not working today, Pelle.

01:34:33.287 --> 01:34:34.879
Isaiah...
- Think of how old I am.

01:34:35.047 --> 01:34:36.924
Daniel...

01:34:37.127 --> 01:34:39.800
Isaiah..., Daniel...

01:34:40.727 --> 01:34:42.206
Jesus.

01:34:42.447 --> 01:34:44.881
Not Jesus! Of course not, not him.

01:34:45.247 --> 01:34:47.920
Isaiah, Daniel...
- They sure had devilish names.

01:34:48.087 --> 01:34:50.840
You got tongued-tied.
- Try papa.

01:34:53.367 --> 01:34:55.244
Isaiah.
- Isaiah.

01:34:55.407 --> 01:34:56.965
Daniel.
- Daniel.

01:34:57.447 --> 01:34:58.960
Ezequiel.
- Ezequiel.

01:35:00.367 --> 01:35:03.120
And Jeremiah!
- Jeremiah!

01:35:03.727 --> 01:35:07.606
Isaiah, Daniel, Ezequiel...
- Isaiah, Daniel, Ezequiel...

01:35:07.807 --> 01:35:09.126
And Jeremiah.
- And Jeremiah.

01:35:09.447 --> 01:35:12.803
Isaiah, Daniel, Ezequiel...
- Isaiah, Daniel, Ezequiel...

01:35:12.967 --> 01:35:14.366
And Jeremiah.
- And Jeremiah.

01:35:14.607 --> 01:35:17.917
Isaiah, Daniel, Ezequiel...
- Isaiah, Daniel, Ezequiel...

01:35:18.087 --> 01:35:19.440
And Jeremiah.
- Jeremiah.

01:36:23.687 --> 01:36:25.120
Will you never grow up?

01:36:54.007 --> 01:36:56.646
Don't be afraid.
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

01:37:06.367 --> 01:37:08.278
Are you going to the barber's then?

01:37:08.807 --> 01:37:10.365
That's the last thing I'd do.

01:37:45.407 --> 01:37:47.159
Erik are you coming?

01:37:50.167 --> 01:37:51.839
Are you coming to the fair, Erik?

01:37:55.687 --> 01:37:56.722
Come, Erik.

01:37:59.127 --> 01:38:00.276
Come on.

01:38:03.607 --> 01:38:05.563
Come on, Erik.

01:38:08.727 --> 01:38:10.240
Isn't Erik coming?

01:38:13.367 --> 01:38:15.927
He can't stay alone here
without the foreman.

01:38:16.087 --> 01:38:17.406
He doesn't want to go.

01:38:18.727 --> 01:38:22.117
Can't you go inside and get him?
You're the only one he listens to.

01:38:27.687 --> 01:38:28.483
Come on, Erik!

01:38:29.327 --> 01:38:30.521
Let's go.

01:38:32.047 --> 01:38:33.560
We're going to the fair.

01:39:11.607 --> 01:39:15.441
Isaiah, Daniel, Ezekiel, Jeremiah.

01:39:15.847 --> 01:39:19.396
Isaiah, Daniel, Ezekiel, Jeremiah!

01:39:21.127 --> 01:39:24.563
Those were the days.
Imagine, two wives.

01:39:25.007 --> 01:39:28.795
One could make coffee and
the other could mend and sew.

01:39:57.247 --> 01:39:59.124
Everything's for sale!

01:39:59.967 --> 01:40:02.003
You can take four packages!

01:40:07.367 --> 01:40:08.322
Pelle.

01:40:19.367 --> 01:40:20.277
Hello.

01:43:19.007 --> 01:43:20.406
What's going on here?

01:43:24.687 --> 01:43:26.120
I'm leaving, aunt.

01:43:28.127 --> 01:43:29.037
I need to go.

01:43:30.367 --> 01:43:32.835
But Signe, is there a problem?

01:43:33.007 --> 01:43:35.362
If so, I'm sure we can solve it.

01:43:36.047 --> 01:43:37.765
It's the isolation from
all my friends.

01:43:39.887 --> 01:43:42.321
I'm a city girl so...

01:43:43.007 --> 01:43:44.918
...so I'm returning.
- But you...

01:43:45.087 --> 01:43:47.157
...say nothing, Signe.
- I...

01:43:47.407 --> 01:43:50.126
...I know that I must told you before
- I'm so disappointed.

01:43:50.327 --> 01:43:51.646
I don't understand.

01:43:52.647 --> 01:43:54.478
It's just time to leave
to Copenhagen.

01:43:55.487 --> 01:43:56.806
But I thought...

01:43:57.847 --> 01:44:00.361
...Kongstrup and I were sure
you were happy here.

01:44:03.927 --> 01:44:05.246
Dear Signe.

01:44:06.767 --> 01:44:10.601
I don't know what else to say.
I've made my decision.

01:44:12.047 --> 01:44:13.446
So suddenly...

01:44:14.087 --> 01:44:16.681
If you had mentioned it before
I could understand.

01:44:18.007 --> 01:44:20.475
Sorry.
- Why didn't you...?

01:44:22.367 --> 01:44:25.404
Is your reason why you don't look at
the eyes. Should I know something?

01:44:25.727 --> 01:44:26.762
Signe?

01:44:31.047 --> 01:44:32.446
How are you going to manage?

01:44:32.927 --> 01:44:35.760
Well, you see...
- Who buy you a ticket?

01:44:36.487 --> 01:44:40.241
Kongstrup takes me to the boat.

01:44:40.407 --> 01:44:42.762
Thank God. I don't have to worry.

01:44:43.127 --> 01:44:44.799
If only I could understand...

01:44:45.447 --> 01:44:47.438
You will return here for a visit?

01:44:48.847 --> 01:44:52.396
I'd hope you would take over
around the farm at an old age.

01:44:52.567 --> 01:44:54.125
Kongstrup too wanted it.

01:44:54.567 --> 01:44:57.400
Signe, dearest, don't cry!

01:44:57.727 --> 01:45:00.036
It's not as serious as all that.

01:45:00.487 --> 01:45:02.284
I want you to feel free...

01:45:02.647 --> 01:45:05.798
...to visit us the times
that you want.

01:45:26.287 --> 01:45:27.402
Kongstrup!

01:45:29.367 --> 01:45:30.766
Kongstrup!

01:45:33.527 --> 01:45:35.836
Come out and talk to me!

01:45:38.007 --> 01:45:40.282
I'm here to collect
the money, Kongstrup!

01:45:41.327 --> 01:45:42.362
Kongstrup!

01:46:01.407 --> 01:46:02.760
Look who it is!

01:46:05.127 --> 01:46:06.606
Let me say hello to you.

01:46:09.007 --> 01:46:11.441
Are you too proud to
say hello to me?

01:46:12.687 --> 01:46:14.086
Do you think that you're better?

01:46:15.607 --> 01:46:17.837
Is it because you're leaving
to have your bastard son...

01:46:18.007 --> 01:46:20.840
...on the other side of the sea,
while I had mine in a turnip patch?

01:46:21.007 --> 01:46:23.043
But it was the same
old whoremonger.

01:46:23.247 --> 01:46:25.044
The same whoremonger as ever!

01:46:27.367 --> 01:46:29.437
Signe, Signe.

01:46:29.847 --> 01:46:30.996
Signe.

01:46:31.167 --> 01:46:33.283
Would you tell him that
I need the money?

01:46:33.447 --> 01:46:35.165
Why do you leave evil eye?

01:46:35.327 --> 01:46:37.363
I warned you!

01:46:37.527 --> 01:46:39.518
Let me go! Let me go!

01:46:39.687 --> 01:46:43.316
Kongstrup, come on and help
you're old sweetheart!

01:46:43.807 --> 01:46:44.876
Let me go!

01:46:45.047 --> 01:46:46.002
Let me go!

01:46:46.167 --> 01:46:48.123
Let me go!

01:47:52.647 --> 01:47:54.319
What do you stare?

01:48:09.647 --> 01:48:12.525
If I've to search for you once more...
- Sorry madame.

01:48:29.647 --> 01:48:31.126
It beats me.

01:48:31.767 --> 01:48:35.123
I would have thought that only
dead could end such grief.

01:48:36.047 --> 01:48:38.083
She must have an iron grip on herself

01:49:51.127 --> 01:49:52.845
Wake up! Send the doctor, quick!

01:49:56.487 --> 01:49:57.602
What is it papa?

01:49:58.247 --> 01:50:01.080
Dear Jesus! It must be something bad.

01:50:07.567 --> 01:50:11.082
What is it?
- It's so awful.

01:50:11.247 --> 01:50:12.043
What is it?

01:50:13.367 --> 01:50:15.119
What? What did you say?

01:50:15.287 --> 01:50:17.118
She cut...!
- What is it?

01:50:19.127 --> 01:50:20.082
What happened?
- Kongstrup.

01:50:20.247 --> 01:50:21.805
What?
- He's bleeding.

01:50:21.967 --> 01:50:23.878
We should get some help.
- Really?

01:51:07.407 --> 01:51:08.362
It's fun!

01:51:48.927 --> 01:51:51.521
Mister Freeze, could you
tell us what this means?

01:51:51.687 --> 01:51:55.441
Pelle is the young cuckoo
in missus Olson's nest.

01:51:57.647 --> 01:51:59.638
Ins't she married to a seaman?

01:51:59.807 --> 01:52:01.286
He's captain Olson's bride.

01:52:01.447 --> 01:52:03.517
Your father doesn't care
about that, does he?

01:52:03.767 --> 01:52:05.883
He's captain Olson's bride.

01:52:06.047 --> 01:52:08.686
Your father doesn't care
about that, does he?

01:52:08.847 --> 01:52:10.565
Watch out! Watch out!

01:52:10.727 --> 01:52:13.116
Any girl would like to marry
a man like that.

01:52:13.287 --> 01:52:15.278
What if her husband
comes back, Pelle?

01:52:32.367 --> 01:52:34.119
Guess what Pelle?

01:52:34.287 --> 01:52:35.879
This is for Captain Olson!

01:52:46.767 --> 01:52:49.600
Just you wait Pelle,
we're gonna get you.

01:53:20.727 --> 01:53:21.876
Pelle.

01:53:23.887 --> 01:53:26.321
I've thinking a lot
about the situation.

01:53:29.287 --> 01:53:32.199
You and I would be welcome
at missus Olson's.

01:53:35.767 --> 01:53:37.405
We could move right in.

01:53:44.527 --> 01:53:45.926
I mean...

01:53:46.407 --> 01:53:50.195
It's against the law to
move in with a woman who's married.

01:53:51.327 --> 01:53:53.602
But...

01:53:54.567 --> 01:53:57.764
I want some comfort.

01:54:00.607 --> 01:54:03.485
We could make it look like
the two of us are labourers.

01:54:07.247 --> 01:54:10.045
She could sew you new clothes.

01:54:10.447 --> 01:54:12.278
Wouldn't it be nice to
have new underwear?

01:54:15.127 --> 01:54:16.355
lf...

01:54:16.847 --> 01:54:18.678
...I did move in with missus Olson...

01:54:19.327 --> 01:54:21.318
...you did move in with missus Olson?

01:54:25.087 --> 01:54:27.726
It's a lot easier for you.
Is all ahead of you.

01:54:27.927 --> 01:54:30.122
Your whole future to make
something happen.

01:54:30.367 --> 01:54:32.005
I need someone to take care of me.

01:54:32.927 --> 01:54:35.043
I'll run away if you move in.

01:54:36.567 --> 01:54:39.081
You have to grow
old to say that to me.

01:54:39.287 --> 01:54:40.561
Just look what you're doing?

01:54:40.727 --> 01:54:42.206
Someone else will have
to fill in the holes.

01:54:42.367 --> 01:54:44.881
So the foreman doesn't find you out.

01:54:45.087 --> 01:54:46.679
Stop that right now.

01:54:46.927 --> 01:54:50.044
I don't make acarving of you
and missus Olson in bed.

01:54:50.207 --> 01:54:52.118
You're getting a little so far.
Come back here!

01:54:52.407 --> 01:54:56.366
You'd better watch out I don't
send the foreman on you.

01:55:06.807 --> 01:55:07.717
Pelle!

01:55:09.647 --> 01:55:10.523
Pelle!

01:55:11.927 --> 01:55:12.996
Pelle!

01:55:15.407 --> 01:55:16.760
Could you go by missus Olson's...

01:55:16.927 --> 01:55:18.883
...on your way back from school?

01:55:20.807 --> 01:55:23.116
This is something she's
going to mend for us.

01:55:25.127 --> 01:55:27.800
And be sure to tell her
I'll come by this evening.

01:55:28.287 --> 01:55:30.960
Why don't you marry her, papa?

01:55:31.647 --> 01:55:33.877
Pelle, I will.

01:55:34.767 --> 01:55:37.201
But we've got to deal with
the country's authorities.

01:55:38.647 --> 01:55:41.400
Missus Olson needs a dead
certificate from the government.

01:55:42.727 --> 01:55:45.287
But soon we'll have coffee and bed.

01:56:03.687 --> 01:56:06.918
It's missus Olson's young cuckoo!

01:56:29.567 --> 01:56:31.717
Let's see how tough you are, Pelle.

01:56:33.247 --> 01:56:34.646
To the sea with him!

01:56:35.087 --> 01:56:36.645
Run cuckoo bird!
- Run!

01:56:57.407 --> 01:56:59.363
Come on, let's see you dance!

01:56:59.527 --> 01:57:02.166
Run cuckoo bird!

01:57:08.327 --> 01:57:10.602
Come back to Sweden!

01:57:10.767 --> 01:57:12.166
Go away, cuckoo bird!

01:57:12.327 --> 01:57:14.283
Away, away, away, away!

01:57:15.767 --> 01:57:18.406
Away, away, away!

01:57:19.127 --> 01:57:22.756
Away, away, away. Come on!

01:58:45.047 --> 01:58:46.685
Look! It's Captain Olson!

01:59:15.247 --> 01:59:16.202
You're at home already.

01:59:22.487 --> 01:59:24.876
Missus's Olson husband
has come home.

02:00:37.567 --> 02:00:41.003
I will stay here forever...

02:00:41.527 --> 02:00:43.438
...standing here like...

02:00:44.167 --> 02:00:46.203
...a block of hay in the shed.

02:00:47.287 --> 02:00:49.198
I was only looking for a home...

02:00:49.967 --> 02:00:51.923
...to spend my old age.

02:00:52.927 --> 02:00:56.203
I've found someone and I felt free.

02:00:57.967 --> 02:00:59.286
Jesus!

02:01:01.207 --> 02:01:02.845
Jesus, help!

02:02:18.847 --> 02:02:21.236
What the hell is the point of crying?

02:02:23.567 --> 02:02:25.683
I want you to meet my new sweetheart.

02:02:28.047 --> 02:02:29.765
Here, Pelle.

02:02:36.287 --> 02:02:37.766
I forgot...

02:02:39.007 --> 02:02:41.726
...that you didn't this thing.
You're too fine.

02:02:42.687 --> 02:02:44.803
It doesn't help going around...

02:02:44.967 --> 02:02:46.798
...whimpering.

02:02:52.807 --> 02:02:53.796
Papa!

02:02:56.767 --> 02:02:58.678
It's sleepery.

02:03:02.927 --> 02:03:04.997
This is a little devil.

02:03:11.047 --> 02:03:12.480
You're crying?

02:03:15.327 --> 02:03:17.238
If some do something to you...

02:03:18.207 --> 02:03:22.200
...tell them that your father is
Lasse, from Tommelilla.

02:03:22.527 --> 02:03:25.360
It's alright, your father is here.

02:03:25.767 --> 02:03:29.123
And your father can stand
on his own two feet.

02:03:33.607 --> 02:03:35.996
I'm going out to the big house.

02:03:37.687 --> 02:03:39.518
Now the bastard is gonna...

02:03:39.687 --> 02:03:41.678
...have to answer for all these years

02:03:42.407 --> 02:03:44.716
We are going to have a
little talk with the missus.

02:03:44.927 --> 02:03:46.485
I won't let you go out there!

02:04:27.927 --> 02:04:29.076
Erik.

02:04:30.927 --> 02:04:31.803
Erik.

02:04:34.367 --> 02:04:35.243
Erik.

02:04:37.607 --> 02:04:39.802
Spring is coming, that's
what papa says.

02:04:41.607 --> 02:04:43.279
In the spring you'll be...

02:04:44.327 --> 02:04:45.282
...a free man.

02:04:47.247 --> 02:04:48.202
Think of it.

02:04:50.487 --> 02:04:52.523
Then, we can leave this awful place.

02:04:54.727 --> 02:04:56.524
And go out and conquer the world.

02:05:20.527 --> 02:05:21.880
Pelle.

02:05:23.967 --> 02:05:25.639
What is it they all talk about?

02:05:26.247 --> 02:05:27.726
I wouldn't know.

02:05:28.767 --> 02:05:30.359
You haven't heard anything?

02:05:31.287 --> 02:05:34.757
Do you think I wanna go to class
so they can laugh at me some more?

02:05:50.807 --> 02:05:53.526
I know I drink too much.

02:05:54.847 --> 02:05:58.203
But it's difficult not to, when
you're heart is broken.

02:06:03.767 --> 02:06:04.643
Pelle...

02:06:06.087 --> 02:06:09.921
...if I promise you'll never again se
me the way I was yesterday...

02:06:10.647 --> 02:06:12.558
...would you agree to go to school?

02:06:12.727 --> 02:06:13.921
Tomorrow, Pelle?

02:06:14.847 --> 02:06:16.121
Because if you don't...

02:06:18.247 --> 02:06:19.475
...then they will force you.

02:06:19.807 --> 02:06:22.196
There'll be a lot of trouble
with the authority.

02:06:25.607 --> 02:06:27.677
Alright? Say yes.

02:06:30.447 --> 02:06:33.086
10 times 10 is a hundred

02:06:33.487 --> 02:06:36.877
100 times 10 is a thousand.

02:06:37.047 --> 02:06:39.925
100 divided by 10 is 10.

02:06:40.087 --> 02:06:42.920
1000 divided by 10 is 100.

02:06:51.887 --> 02:06:53.081
Mister Freeze?

02:06:53.367 --> 02:06:54.516
Mister Freeze.

02:06:55.407 --> 02:06:56.522
He's asleep.

02:06:56.807 --> 02:06:58.525
Mister Freeze, it's time.

02:07:08.127 --> 02:07:09.082
Sir.

02:07:10.047 --> 02:07:11.924
It's time to go home.

02:08:15.287 --> 02:08:17.084
Pelle, where's your father?

02:08:20.567 --> 02:08:21.761
Fooling around?

02:08:24.487 --> 02:08:26.205
My father would be happy...

02:08:26.367 --> 02:08:29.040
...to marry your father to captain
Olson's second wife.

02:08:36.447 --> 02:08:38.358
Help papa! Help!

02:08:42.527 --> 02:08:45.724
You scoundrel!
How dare you hit my son!

02:08:46.687 --> 02:08:49.247
You're going to hear from
the authorities about this!

02:08:55.287 --> 02:08:56.436
Pelle, Pelle, Pelle...

02:08:56.607 --> 02:08:59.724
That was about the worst you
could do, hit the minister's son.

02:09:00.607 --> 02:09:02.643
The town's minister.

02:09:02.967 --> 02:09:05.117
He deserved it, I'm sure.

02:09:05.287 --> 02:09:07.960
But still you shouldn't have done it.
What else did he do to you?

02:09:08.447 --> 02:09:11.678
He said he could get you married
at boatsman Olson's second wife.

02:09:12.967 --> 02:09:14.082
He did?

02:09:15.847 --> 02:09:16.962
He did?

02:09:18.087 --> 02:09:22.046
If I had him here,
I'd rip his innards out.

02:09:22.447 --> 02:09:23.482
Do you feel revenged?

02:09:23.687 --> 02:09:24.722
No, not really.

02:09:25.447 --> 02:09:28.803
His father came and gave
what he deserved.

02:09:28.967 --> 02:09:30.036
Revenge.

02:09:31.487 --> 02:09:33.876
It's a bad situation.

02:09:35.927 --> 02:09:38.077
And you don't intend to apologize?

02:09:39.167 --> 02:09:40.885
No, no, you shouldn't.

02:09:44.247 --> 02:09:47.364
Although maybe you should...
No, no.

02:09:48.127 --> 02:09:49.606
You have to twist and turn...

02:09:50.447 --> 02:09:52.085
...as the eel said in the frying pan.

02:09:56.927 --> 02:09:59.282
We are very sorry to bother you...

02:09:59.447 --> 02:10:02.007
We have no choice, but...

02:10:02.407 --> 02:10:03.999
...to ask for your help.

02:10:05.047 --> 02:10:06.844
Did you blow your nose properly?

02:10:08.687 --> 02:10:10.803
We are very sorry to bother you, Sir.

02:10:11.327 --> 02:10:12.521
I'm very sorry.

02:10:19.567 --> 02:10:21.558
There's probably no one home.
- Let's go in.

02:10:21.887 --> 02:10:23.525
We can't stand here all day.

02:10:23.687 --> 02:10:26.679
Go first, if you think you
can handle this better.

02:10:28.167 --> 02:10:29.395
Come in.

02:10:31.127 --> 02:10:32.560
Good day.

02:10:32.967 --> 02:10:34.366
Good day.

02:10:36.487 --> 02:10:38.318
It's like this...

02:10:40.447 --> 02:10:43.678
I hope the proprietor
be angry with us.

02:10:45.647 --> 02:10:47.160
He won't be angry.

02:10:52.047 --> 02:10:53.924
You must forgive us for coming here...

02:10:54.087 --> 02:10:56.476
...to talk about something which
has nothing to do with the farm.

02:10:57.207 --> 02:10:58.435
But...

02:11:00.727 --> 02:11:02.683
...when the father's sins...

02:11:03.367 --> 02:11:05.198
...are visited upon his son.

02:11:06.247 --> 02:11:07.566
Then...

02:11:07.727 --> 02:11:09.558
Then...
- Why are you standing?

02:11:10.487 --> 02:11:11.556
Sit down, please.

02:11:11.727 --> 02:11:13.479
Thank you.
- Why you haven't...

02:11:13.647 --> 02:11:14.841
...offered them a sit, dear?

02:11:23.487 --> 02:11:25.398
Thank you.
- What is it?

02:11:26.407 --> 02:11:27.396
You need money?

02:11:27.927 --> 02:11:29.724
No, it's...

02:11:30.247 --> 02:11:31.680
Is just like a...

02:11:32.327 --> 02:11:34.045
It's just that...

02:11:37.727 --> 02:11:39.877
I hope that you won't be angry but...

02:11:41.447 --> 02:11:42.846
...it's...

02:11:43.727 --> 02:11:45.001
It's the boy.

02:11:45.887 --> 02:11:47.605
They're going to send him away.

02:11:48.247 --> 02:11:49.521
Send him away?
- Yes.

02:11:49.727 --> 02:11:50.876
¿ What have you done?

02:11:57.567 --> 02:11:59.364
I beat up the minister's son.

02:12:00.687 --> 02:12:01.881
And why you did you do that?

02:12:06.007 --> 02:12:08.237
Because he said evil
things about Lasse.

02:12:09.767 --> 02:12:10.836
What did he say?

02:12:12.167 --> 02:12:15.125
He called me...

02:12:16.967 --> 02:12:19.720
He called me Mrs. Olson's plaything.

02:12:20.327 --> 02:12:22.636
You know, the kids...

02:12:28.327 --> 02:12:29.521
I was...

02:12:30.607 --> 02:12:32.279
...Mrs. Olson's sweetheart.

02:12:32.447 --> 02:12:34.642
Because everyone thought
she was a widow.

02:12:37.167 --> 02:12:40.284
And other day her husband
came home from the sea.

02:12:43.447 --> 02:12:44.562
Here.

02:12:46.967 --> 02:12:50.198
And the boy made Pelle furious.
- Yes, unfortunately.

02:12:51.127 --> 02:12:52.276
That's how it is.

02:12:52.447 --> 02:12:53.277
With poor wretches...

02:12:53.447 --> 02:12:55.517
...they're only there to be pecked at

02:12:55.687 --> 02:12:58.247
Well, I prefer the bird that pecks
back and defends his nest...

02:12:58.447 --> 02:13:00.244
...regardless of the poor it is.

02:13:01.887 --> 02:13:05.516
I'll do what I can.
Don't worry about it anymore.

02:13:05.767 --> 02:13:06.722
Thank you.

02:13:08.927 --> 02:13:09.916
By the way.

02:13:10.647 --> 02:13:12.842
My husband and I decided...

02:13:13.087 --> 02:13:17.080
...the young assistant to
our foreman will be leaving.

02:13:17.647 --> 02:13:21.401
Maybe Pelle would like to
become his replacement.

02:13:26.047 --> 02:13:27.446
Thank you.

02:13:27.727 --> 02:13:29.445
Say thank you.

02:13:43.087 --> 02:13:46.557
Almost as if she thought
it was her own idea?

02:13:46.847 --> 02:13:48.644
She thought, she thought it herself.

02:13:50.767 --> 02:13:51.995
Your recognized this?

02:13:52.647 --> 02:13:54.877
They're a bit big, but
we'll stuff them with papers.

02:13:55.047 --> 02:13:56.400
Try them on.

02:14:01.767 --> 02:14:04.122
I'll get some boot wax,
and they'll be like new.

02:14:05.287 --> 02:14:06.959
Now let's have a look.

02:14:11.727 --> 02:14:15.276
Stand up straight. I want
you stand very straight.

02:14:15.487 --> 02:14:18.240
Shoulders back and
chin a little forward.

02:14:18.407 --> 02:14:20.557
Not like that. Lift you chin a little

02:14:20.727 --> 02:14:23.082
Now a sharp look in the eye.

02:14:23.727 --> 02:14:25.797
You must command respect for yourself

02:14:27.007 --> 02:14:29.475
The way you stand and the look
in your eye. That's what does it.

02:14:33.127 --> 02:14:36.039
Let the others labour.
You give the orders.

02:14:37.047 --> 02:14:38.400
You can't take tonight off!

02:14:38.567 --> 02:14:40.080
Clean now the cow down!

02:14:42.047 --> 02:14:43.082
And Pelle...

02:14:44.247 --> 02:14:46.158
Maybe you'll get to eat
sunday dinner with the proprietor.

02:14:46.327 --> 02:14:49.558
And have a napkin-ring
with your name on it.

02:14:50.047 --> 02:14:51.366
Pelle Karlsson.

02:15:03.527 --> 02:15:07.122
And who knows, Pelle. Maybe
one day you'll be the foreman.

02:15:07.487 --> 02:15:11.275
I could tell you the way she
was thinking it was perfect.

02:15:37.567 --> 02:15:38.841
Erik!

02:15:43.247 --> 02:15:44.521
Erik!

02:15:47.807 --> 02:15:49.320
Erik!

02:15:50.127 --> 02:15:51.526
Wait for me!

02:15:54.367 --> 02:15:55.686
Erik!

02:16:20.487 --> 02:16:21.886
I don't want it.

02:16:26.567 --> 02:16:28.285
We must leave here, papa.

02:16:28.807 --> 02:16:30.286
Now.

02:17:00.527 --> 02:17:01.562
It's Karna.

02:17:01.727 --> 02:17:03.046
I get here in time.

02:17:03.727 --> 02:17:05.843
I was afraid the foreman
and the missus would see me.

02:17:07.127 --> 02:17:08.639
A gift for you.

02:17:09.246 --> 02:17:10.726
It's a down quilt.

02:17:10.967 --> 02:17:14.198
It'll keep you warm. No matter
where you end up in the world.

02:17:15.447 --> 02:17:16.674
Bye, Gabriela.

02:17:20.647 --> 02:17:21.841
Bye, Blanca.

02:17:22.367 --> 02:17:23.846
You'll be a good girl.

02:17:33.486 --> 02:17:34.966
Well, Aspasia.

02:17:35.566 --> 02:17:37.364
Time to say goodbye to Pelle.

02:17:37.927 --> 02:17:39.996
He is going up to see the world.

02:17:47.927 --> 02:17:49.155
Papa.

02:17:55.447 --> 02:17:56.721
What is it?

02:18:04.566 --> 02:18:06.000
Can't we stay?

02:18:33.486 --> 02:18:35.205
You'll have to go
without me, Pelle.

02:18:36.727 --> 02:18:38.683
I don't have the strength anymore.

02:18:38.967 --> 02:18:40.958
I'm too old. It's the reason.

02:18:42.527 --> 02:18:43.925
Too old.

02:18:46.166 --> 02:18:47.805
There's no future for an old man.

02:18:51.527 --> 02:18:52.754
Do you understand that?

02:19:12.047 --> 02:19:13.958
I'll make a bundle for you.

02:19:14.607 --> 02:19:17.599
You can have 2 of
my shirts then you have 4.

02:19:18.767 --> 02:19:20.644
Then one you're wearing is clean.

02:19:21.447 --> 02:19:24.007
And remember: never wear
it more than two weeks...

02:19:24.166 --> 02:19:26.522
...at a time, otherwise you
get bad name in town.

02:19:26.807 --> 02:19:29.321
And change your socks
before they wear out.

02:19:29.486 --> 02:19:31.442
Keep your clothes clean.
Keep your good name.

02:19:31.647 --> 02:19:34.366
You save half the work and all shames

02:19:39.246 --> 02:19:41.282
You can have my boots too.

02:19:43.807 --> 02:19:45.798
They are a bit worn.

02:19:49.527 --> 02:19:51.119
And here's the Bible.

02:19:55.367 --> 02:19:57.403
Your mohter said
I was to give it to you...

02:19:57.807 --> 02:20:00.002
...on the day she went
out to the world.

02:20:29.527 --> 02:20:33.122
Next time we'll meet maybe
there'll be a proper home for you.

02:20:38.087 --> 02:20:39.805
Say Karna goodbye.

02:20:49.127 --> 02:20:50.526
Goodbye, papa.

02:20:52.767 --> 02:20:53.643
Thank you.
