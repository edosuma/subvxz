Here's your check, Mr. ZZ
and Mr. Top.

00:07.041 --> 00:08.507
Would you like a to-go box,

00:08.509 --> 00:09.508
or are you just gonna put it
in your beard

00:09.510 --> 00:12.544
with the rest of your sandwich?

00:12.546 --> 00:13.946
We're in a beard-growing
contest.

00:13.948 --> 00:15.014
They happen all over
the country.

00:15.016 --> 00:16.281
It's a pretty big deal.

00:16.283 --> 00:17.282
What's first prize?

00:17.284 --> 00:20.486
Blindfold for your girlfriends?

00:20.488 --> 00:23.288
I'm kidding, I know you don't
have girlfriends.

00:23.290 --> 00:25.357
Actually, this level
of hair-art

00:25.359 --> 00:27.526
takes months of hard work
and commitment.

00:27.528 --> 00:32.398
Well, quack, quack,

00:36.170 --> 00:38.537
Let me tell you something
on behalf of women everywhere.

00:38.539 --> 00:41.306
We. Don't. Like. Beards.

00:41.308 --> 00:43.208
Caroline?
Beards?

00:43.210 --> 00:46.345
(Caroline)
I never liked being one.

00:46.347 --> 00:51.350
Ladies, if his name is Trace,
get the hell out of there.

00:51.352 --> 00:53.519
See?
So, shave losers.

00:53.521 --> 00:56.755
If you're chinless
or chin-plentiful,

00:56.757 --> 00:59.058
it's better than
what you've got going on.

00:59.060 --> 01:02.628
There's your tip,
be generous with mine.

01:02.630 --> 01:05.230
You actually insult people
and then expect them

01:05.232 --> 01:06.598
to give you money?

01:06.600 --> 01:10.102
That's how it works
with you and me.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.554
I've sold four in the last hour.

01:28.556 --> 01:32.691
Three more and we can afford
that towel we've had our eye on.

01:32.693 --> 01:34.026
These T-shirts keep selling.

01:34.028 --> 01:35.494
That means more money.

I think I dated

Hey, everybody.

01:46.273 --> 01:48.273
Mind if I stop
for a breather?

01:48.275 --> 01:52.211
I've been "briding"
my ass off.

01:52.213 --> 01:54.580
Sophie, are those all your
bridal magazines?

01:54.582 --> 01:55.948
That's only half.

01:55.950 --> 01:58.016
Come on, Oleg!

01:58.018 --> 02:00.786
Look, if those are too heavy,
how are you going to be able

02:00.788 --> 02:05.357
to push the wedding donkey
down the aisle?

02:05.359 --> 02:06.992
Wedding donkey?

02:06.994 --> 02:09.761
My excitement level for this
wedding just skyrocketed.

02:09.763 --> 02:11.430
Relax, Sophie.

02:11.432 --> 02:14.466
If I know how to do anything,
it's how to move an ass.

02:14.468 --> 02:17.136
That's true.
Yeah.

02:17.138 --> 02:21.440
Wow, you're carrying more heavy
issues than Amanda Bynes.

married.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.234

I might need a Tuesday off.

Sophie, why don't you get some
help from your Maid of Honor?

02:54.975 --> 02:55.974
I will kill you.

Oh, Sophie, my cousin, Svetlana,
is a wedding planner.

03:02.983 --> 03:06.451
Okay, but she better be good.

Because I want everything

I can't believe this.

They're getting married and
I don't have a wedding donkey

03:23.804 --> 03:27.105
anywhere on my horizon.

03:27.107 --> 03:29.975
OMG, you sell these T-shirts?

03:29.977 --> 03:31.843
I just bought one.

03:31.845 --> 03:34.179
Did I jut sell you that shirt
and already forgot?

03:34.181 --> 03:35.480
I knew that nine-cent deodorant

03:35.482 --> 03:38.650
was going to give me
brain lesions.

03:38.652 --> 03:40.619
Well, the label did have
a picture of a brain

03:40.621 --> 03:44.356
with "No Bueno" written on it.

03:44.358 --> 03:46.525
No, I bought it at a store
in Manhattan

03:46.527 --> 03:48.327
on East Ninth and Broadway.

03:48.329 --> 03:50.629
I know because I'm OCD
and it was 67 steps

03:50.631 --> 03:54.299
and 14 sidewalk cracks
from the corner.

03:54.301 --> 03:56.635
Max, someone else is selling
our shirts.

03:56.637 --> 03:58.136
I know.

03:58.138 --> 04:01.740
We're getting hosed
by some other hoes.

04:04.544 --> 04:06.745
I can't believe they stole
our shirt.

04:06.747 --> 04:09.915
The one thing we made that
people actually wanted to buy.

04:09.917 --> 04:12.117
I feel like Myspace.

04:12.119 --> 04:14.453
I haven't seen anything
this upsetting in a window

04:14.455 --> 04:16.421

caught a reflection

04:16.423 --> 04:21.193
of myself in my
waitress uniform.

We need to talk to someone

04:25.299 --> 04:27.299
What she means is,
we wish to speak to someone

04:27.301 --> 04:29.568
about the adorable
cupcake T-shirts in the window.

04:29.570 --> 04:32.571
Or, we will be about to rumble.

04:32.573 --> 04:34.573
I'm just working here
till I get my PhD

04:34.575 --> 04:38.110

of Western Civilization.

04:38.112 --> 04:40.145
So, forever?

04:40.147 --> 04:41.780
Those T-shirts are our design

04:41.782 --> 04:43.115
and we need to know why
they're here

04:43.117 --> 04:44.950
and who knocked them off.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.885
It's the granddaughter
of the woman who owns this shop.

04:46.887 --> 04:49.655
She's kind of a monster
and she's walking in right now.

04:49.657 --> 04:51.490
Hi, Kemberly and Ashlin.

04:51.492 --> 04:53.292
These ladies are interested
in your T-shirts.

04:53.294 --> 04:54.493
Aren't they cute?

04:54.495 --> 04:55.494
So cute.

04:55.496 --> 04:57.262
Yeah, super cute.

04:57.264 --> 04:58.330
We designed them.

04:58.332 --> 05:00.732
Yeah, we designed them.

05:00.734 --> 05:01.733
What?

05:01.735 --> 05:03.468
Yeah, what?

05:03.470 --> 05:05.504
Ashlin and Kimberly, is it?

05:05.506 --> 05:07.472
It's Kemberly, with an "E."

05:07.474 --> 05:09.808
I changed it myself
'cause I'm original.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.377
Yeah, she's an original.

05:12.379 --> 05:14.513
You know what's not original?

05:14.515 --> 05:16.915
Those shirts.
You stole them from us.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.717
We did not steal your idea.

05:18.719 --> 05:21.086
Yeah, we did not steal
your idea.

05:21.088 --> 05:25.524
We copied it from this lame
cupcake shop in Brooklyn.

05:25.526 --> 05:28.026
Wait a minute...

05:28.028 --> 05:32.164
we have a lame cupcake shop
in Brooklyn.

05:32.166 --> 05:35.000
Ashlin, you talk too much.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.069
This is why everyone knows
about my lap-band.

05:37.071 --> 05:39.237
I think they know about it
because you lost 200 pounds

05:39.239 --> 05:42.007
over Spring break.

05:42.009 --> 05:45.444
It's hard to believe she was
once twice this obnoxious.

05:45.446 --> 05:46.945
If you don't stop selling
our T-shirts,

05:46.947 --> 05:48.780
we're gonna have to get
our lawyer involved.

05:48.782 --> 05:51.783
Yeah, we're gonna have to get
our lawyer involved.

05:51.785 --> 05:54.853
And he's gonna kill you.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.622
I don't know
what lawyers do.

05:57.624 --> 05:59.991
We're totally not
doing this for us.

05:59.993 --> 06:00.992
We're rich.

06:00.994 --> 06:02.794
Yeah, we're rich.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.963
A percentage of every shirt
that we sell goes to charity.

06:04.965 --> 06:07.699
Yeah, it goes to charity.

06:07.701 --> 06:11.770
We are the charity
that it needs to go to.

06:11.772 --> 06:13.505
You're old and desperate
for money.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.273
And I totally get it.

06:15.275 --> 06:17.175
My aunt's one of the
Real Housewives of New York.

06:17.177 --> 06:19.144
But, sorry.

06:19.146 --> 06:24.449
It's the one without
the leg.

06:24.451 --> 06:26.051
What just happened here?

06:26.053 --> 06:27.486
That girl just called you old.

06:34.127 --> 06:37.229
Earl, I don't think I'm going
to be buying you that pinky ring

06:37.231 --> 06:41.066
you wanted any time soon.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.402
No rush Max,
you got plenty of time.

06:43.404 --> 06:49.040
I got like, six or seven months
before I turn to dust.

06:49.042 --> 06:51.009
It's 'cause our T-shirts
got ripped off

06:51.011 --> 06:53.311
by a couple of prep school
girls in Manhattan.

06:53.313 --> 06:56.081
It's like a bad 80's movie.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.949
I don't know whether to
date James Spader

06:57.951 --> 07:03.455
or teach this town how to dance.

07:03.457 --> 07:04.990
This is so unfair.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.658
Those girls can't just steal
from us.

07:06.660 --> 07:09.828
This isn't 7-Eleven.

07:09.830 --> 07:12.731
Max, I can't believe
your naiveté.

07:12.733 --> 07:16.668
What does my body spray
have to do with anything?

07:16.670 --> 07:18.970
Look, there is no reason
to be so upset

07:18.972 --> 07:20.505
about those two girls.

07:20.507 --> 07:22.274
They're not going
to affect our business.

07:22.276 --> 07:24.443
Plus, they have to live
with themselves.

07:24.445 --> 07:26.144
And karma is a bitch.

07:26.146 --> 07:31.616
I mean, I littered once
and look what happened to me.

07:31.618 --> 07:35.620
Hey, everybody.

07:35.622 --> 07:40.592
I'm up to my nuts
in bridal junk.

07:41.595 --> 07:42.661
There she is.

07:42.663 --> 07:43.995
The love of my life.

07:43.997 --> 07:45.497
The yin to my yang.

07:45.499 --> 07:49.701
The zing to my wang.

07:49.703 --> 07:53.672
Save that gold for the vows.

07:53.674 --> 07:56.107
I am Svetlana, Oleg's cousin.

07:56.109 --> 07:57.776
Well, darling,
it could be worse.

07:57.778 --> 08:00.745
You could be his sister.

08:00.747 --> 08:02.747
Svetty!

08:02.749 --> 08:05.684
And you must be Sophie.

08:05.686 --> 08:07.252
Yeah.

08:07.254 --> 08:10.555
No.

08:10.557 --> 08:13.258
But you haven't even heard
any ideas.

08:13.260 --> 08:16.962
Caroline.

08:16.964 --> 08:18.763
Sophie, why did you
just say my name?

08:18.765 --> 08:21.766
Oh, it's Oleg's
and my safe word.

08:25.071 --> 08:29.641
Yeah.
It means no.

08:29.643 --> 08:34.646
It's the one word we both agreed
we would never say during sex.

08:36.415 --> 08:38.049
Are you sure?

08:38.051 --> 08:42.821
Because I give free oil change
with every wedding.

08:42.823 --> 08:47.158
Caroline.

08:47.160 --> 08:52.230
All right, well,
I'll be in my booth.

08:52.232 --> 08:55.834
You know, this wedding planner
thing is as crappy as the movie

08:55.836 --> 08:59.638
of the same name.

08:59.640 --> 09:02.040
Girls, I forgot to tell you,

09:02.042 --> 09:04.809
a man came by today
with this letter for you.

09:04.811 --> 09:10.382
This reminds me of when
I was a young, hot-shot courier.

09:10.384 --> 09:13.218
I was a young, hot-shot courier
once, too.

09:13.220 --> 09:17.822
I used to deliver drugs to my
mother at work on my tricycle.

09:17.824 --> 09:20.025
Oh, my God, Max,
you're not gonna believe this,

09:20.027 --> 09:23.361
but those two girls have issued
a Cease and Desist order.

09:23.363 --> 09:24.362
Those bitches.

09:24.364 --> 09:26.264
What's that?

09:26.266 --> 09:29.267
They're saying we have to stop
selling our T-shirts.

09:29.269 --> 09:30.902
That's what I told them
we were going to do.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.771
They even copied this idea.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.606
We need to get a lawyer.

09:34.608 --> 09:38.610
How? We can't even afford
<i>Law & Order</i> on iTunes.

09:38.612 --> 09:39.878
Hey, do you think we could
afford that lawyer

09:39.880 --> 09:41.580
on the subway billboards?

09:41.582 --> 09:45.617
The one who has a gavel in one
hand and a chicken in the other?

09:45.619 --> 09:50.255
I think he just
does<i> acidentes.</i>

09:50.257 --> 09:51.890
What is going on here?

09:51.892 --> 09:53.458
There's food waiting
in the window,

09:53.460 --> 09:55.527
periodicals strewn about.

09:55.529 --> 09:58.630
Someone's on his periodical.

09:58.632 --> 10:00.131
Han, we just got served.

10:00.133 --> 10:04.436
At least someone
in the diner has.

10:04.438 --> 10:06.705
You're lucky your boss
is so chill.

10:06.707 --> 10:11.276
Of course you're chill, you're
one of Mr. Popper's penguins.

10:15.781 --> 10:17.315
How about this?

10:17.317 --> 10:19.784
We'll do the jobs
you already pay us for

10:19.786 --> 10:22.120
if you agree to pretend
to be our lawyer.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.421
You have a suit, right?

10:23.423 --> 10:24.923
Why would I pretend
to be a lawyer?

10:24.925 --> 10:29.594
You can't even pretend
to be waitresses.

10:29.596 --> 10:32.764
No one's gonna believe
Han's our lawyer, anyway.

10:32.766 --> 10:37.602
He can't pass the bar,
he can barely see over one.

10:37.604 --> 10:40.572
That's it! I've had it with you
two and your non-work ethic.

10:40.574 --> 10:42.307
And this area is for customers.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.142
I want these out of here!

10:44.144 --> 10:48.580
<i>(Max)</i>
<i>Ow!</i>

10:48.582 --> 10:49.848
Uh-oh.

10:49.850 --> 10:52.951
Max?

10:52.953 --> 10:56.154
I suppose I could dig up a suit
if that could, somehow,

10:56.156 --> 10:59.424
make this boss striking
his employee thing go away.

11:05.031 --> 11:07.899
Max, of course these girls
go to Dalby Hall,

11:07.901 --> 11:09.601
all my archenemies did.

11:09.603 --> 11:13.071
I guess Lady Gaga won
in the end, though.

11:13.073 --> 11:17.075
In other news,
I kind of like this eye-patch.

11:17.077 --> 11:18.877
I know you do,
you were pretending to be

11:18.879 --> 11:21.579
the pirate queen
of the subway.

11:21.581 --> 11:25.583
Well, no one arrrrrgued with us.

11:25.585 --> 11:28.119
How long did the eye doctor
say you have to keep it on?

11:28.121 --> 11:30.422
And by eye doctor, I mean
that first-year med student

11:30.424 --> 11:32.957
we gave the free dessert to.

11:32.959 --> 11:35.293
A few days, which is a bummer,
'cause only seeing half

11:35.295 --> 11:39.631
of how sad we are
is kind of a blessing.

11:39.633 --> 11:41.232
How are we gonna find them?

11:41.234 --> 11:44.803
Follow the scent of our decaying
T-shirts business?

11:44.805 --> 11:47.572
According to Instagram,
they're in the cafeteria, see?

11:47.574 --> 11:49.941
Ashlin just posted a pic
of a mini-pizza.

11:49.943 --> 11:53.712
#thatpizzalife

11:53.714 --> 11:56.347
They have mini-pizzas
here?

11:56.349 --> 11:59.851
My high school
didn't even have heat.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.519
Sorry I'm late.
I had to pick up a suit

12:01.521 --> 12:03.054
at the Men's Warehouse.

12:03.056 --> 12:07.392
Don't you mean
the Not Quite A Man's Warehouse?

12:07.394 --> 12:10.628
Han, I love your lawyer costume.
So authentic.

12:10.630 --> 12:13.665
Only thing missing is the hole
where your soul should be.

12:13.667 --> 12:16.067
Well, as I always say, if you're
going to do something--

12:16.069 --> 12:22.040
Do it with your left hand so it
will feel like someone else?

12:22.042 --> 12:25.510
No, if you're going to do
something, do it right.

12:25.512 --> 12:28.847
Last Halloween, I went as Sprout
from the Green Giant commercial

12:28.849 --> 12:33.151
and I even put pea pods
over my pee-pee.

12:33.153 --> 12:35.987
You laugh, but I won $500.

12:35.989 --> 12:38.590
Okay, I created my own
Cease and Desist order.

12:38.592 --> 12:40.492
Where did you get this?

12:40.494 --> 12:42.026
Same place Max printed
out that fake,

12:42.028 --> 12:44.395
"I don't have herpes"
doctor certificate.

12:44.397 --> 12:46.498
It works.

12:46.500 --> 12:49.200
And here's your business card.

12:49.202 --> 12:50.668
Where?
Where is it?

12:50.670 --> 12:53.671
I can't see.

12:53.673 --> 12:57.308
Here. And Han, I hope
you're a better actor than Max.

12:57.310 --> 13:01.780
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson
is a better actor than Max.

13:01.782 --> 13:02.947
Mr. Lu Su?

13:02.949 --> 13:03.948
That's what you came up with?

13:03.950 --> 13:06.084
Mr. Lu Su?

13:06.086 --> 13:11.289
Well, you're a lawyer, so the
"Su" part is totally on point.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.690
But Lu Su?

13:12.692 --> 13:14.959
No Asian was ever named that.

13:14.961 --> 13:17.328
Maybe not in this galaxy,

13:17.330 --> 13:23.134
but might I remind you
of a Mr. Sulu.

13:23.136 --> 13:27.338
Oh, yeah. I mixed it up.
Genius!

13:27.340 --> 13:29.107
Han, you don't have to
use the cards.

13:29.109 --> 13:30.542
I can make it work.

13:30.544 --> 13:32.377
Two Halloweens ago,
I was an Ewok

13:32.379 --> 13:36.281
and turned an orange bath-towel
into a turban.

13:36.283 --> 13:38.950
Second place. $250.

13:38.952 --> 13:39.951
And next Halloween,
you can wear that

13:39.953 --> 13:43.121
and goes as a lesbian minister.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.893
Okay, so the plan is,
we go in there

13:48.895 --> 13:50.962
and calmly confront them
with our attorney.

13:50.964 --> 13:52.397
I'll do the talking.

13:52.399 --> 13:54.532
Han, you stand there
and try to look smart.

13:54.534 --> 14:00.038
Ah. I'm already Asian.
So, done.

14:00.040 --> 14:03.041
[indistinct chatter]

14:03.043 --> 14:05.977
Wow, this brings me back.

14:05.979 --> 14:08.813
I had a seat at the popular
table, the Debate Team table,

14:08.815 --> 14:10.114
the Student Council table,

14:10.116 --> 14:12.083
and the Waiting For Marriage
table.

14:12.085 --> 14:13.418
But that table
kind of fell apart

14:13.420 --> 14:15.820
when everybody
got pregnant but me.

14:15.822 --> 14:19.624
I ate in the school
parking lot with a wino.

14:19.626 --> 14:22.827
He was so nice to me,
I thought he might be my dad.

14:22.829 --> 14:24.295
But then he never made
a move on me,

14:24.297 --> 14:26.497
so I guess he wasn't.

14:26.499 --> 14:28.633
(Kemberly)
Attention everyone, attention.

14:28.635 --> 14:31.736
Yeah, attention everyone,
attention.

14:31.738 --> 14:34.839
Ashlin and I are here today
to sell our T-shirts

14:34.841 --> 14:38.076
and to talk about bullying
and how it's not cool.

14:38.078 --> 14:39.510
It's so not cool.

14:39.512 --> 14:41.512
I was talking, Ash.

14:41.514 --> 14:44.649
Yeah, she was talking.

14:44.651 --> 14:47.118
Their charity is bullying?

14:47.120 --> 14:52.357
That's like Kanye West trying
to raise money for laying low.

14:52.359 --> 14:55.326
A $3 donation will be made
to our anti-bullying fund

14:55.328 --> 14:58.363
with each purchase of one
of our super, super cute tees.

14:58.365 --> 15:01.032
Super, super cute tees.

15:01.034 --> 15:03.101
My super cute tee!

15:03.103 --> 15:04.836
Best idea I ever had.

15:04.838 --> 15:06.938
Right up there with the bong
with a chin strap

15:06.940 --> 15:10.575
so you could be hands-free
to change the channel.

15:10.577 --> 15:13.244
So buy a shirt right now
and then we'll be back later

15:13.246 --> 15:15.513
for the rest of the anti-bully
talk.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.582
Yeah, buy them
or my dad won't pay

15:17.584 --> 15:20.118
for the lacrosse
equipment this year.

15:24.089 --> 15:26.557
Let's go.
They are making a fortune on us.

15:26.559 --> 15:30.628
And if I'm gonna get screwed,
it better be by someone over 21

15:30.630 --> 15:33.932
Yeah, that sounds like a job
with a two drink minimum.

15:33.934 --> 15:38.069
Han, don't mess this up or
you'll be eating those glasses.

15:38.071 --> 15:41.806
Might I interest you
in an anti-bullying pamphlet?

15:41.808 --> 15:44.742
Might I interest you in a seat
on my finger?

15:44.744 --> 15:47.312
Hey, how did you two
get in here?

15:47.314 --> 15:49.781
The school pays guards out front
to keep out the homeless.

15:49.783 --> 15:51.649
Yeah, well, jokes on you.

15:51.651 --> 15:54.886
'Cause they just let us walk in.

15:54.888 --> 15:57.322
Hello, girls.
You can "Cease and Desist"

15:57.324 --> 15:59.357
selling our T-shirts as of now.

15:59.359 --> 16:01.326
This is
our attorney, Mr....

16:01.328 --> 16:02.894
Lu Su.

16:02.896 --> 16:05.063
And he is holding our
Cease and Desist

16:05.065 --> 16:08.666
to counter your
Cease and Desist.

16:08.668 --> 16:10.902
Okay, well, first,
your lawyer looks like a teacher

16:10.904 --> 16:13.504
on a Disney show.

16:13.506 --> 16:16.574
Is that a bad thing?

16:16.576 --> 16:17.976
And if you have anything
further to say,

16:17.978 --> 16:20.211
you can take it up
with my lawyer. Her dad.

16:20.213 --> 16:21.980
And he's real good.

16:21.982 --> 16:25.483
He got that CEO guy who admitted
he killed his whole family

16:25.485 --> 16:27.986
out on a technicality.

16:27.988 --> 16:29.887
I forgot how mean girls can be.

16:29.889 --> 16:32.757
How? I'm your roommate.

16:32.759 --> 16:35.493
Thank you, Kemberly.
Thank you, Ashlin.

16:39.064 --> 16:40.064
A little help.

16:46.205 --> 16:49.707
Hello, girls,
you all look very nice.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.609
What is he doing?

16:51.611 --> 16:55.346
Hopefully a tight ten and then
he'll bring up the headliner.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.315
This may be hard to believe,
looking at me

16:57.317 --> 16:59.183
in this totally awesome suit,

16:59.185 --> 17:02.186
but I know a little something
about being bullied.

17:02.188 --> 17:03.588
As a little child--

17:03.590 --> 17:06.324
And as a slightly bigger adult.

17:06.326 --> 17:09.594
Seriously? In the middle of his
bullying speech, your bullying?

17:09.596 --> 17:13.031
Kind of surprised even myself.

17:13.033 --> 17:15.033
I have someone who bullies me.

17:15.035 --> 17:17.935
Okay, let's get out
of here while I can.

17:17.937 --> 17:20.538
It's not just the hitting
and the name-calling.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.674
Although, not gonna lie,
that's a real bummer.

17:23.676 --> 17:26.844
You see, girls, the bad thing
about being bullied

17:26.846 --> 17:30.882
is that every time it happens,
it steals a little piece

17:30.884 --> 17:32.450
of who you are.

17:32.452 --> 17:36.320
And then, if it happens enough,
little by little,

17:36.322 --> 17:41.225
you become just a little less
of who you were meant to be.

17:41.227 --> 17:42.960
And that's not cool.

17:42.962 --> 17:45.129
And these two girls up here,
without knowing it, I'm sure,

17:45.131 --> 17:48.633
stole a little piece
of Max and Caroline.

17:48.635 --> 17:51.335
when they stole
their little idea.

17:51.337 --> 17:53.871
And that's so not cool.

17:53.873 --> 17:57.041
Yeah, that's so not cool.

17:57.043 --> 17:59.744
Max, Caroline,
we'll stop making the shirts.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.279
Ash, I never said that.

18:01.281 --> 18:03.915
Ah, no, Kemberly.
I did.

18:03.917 --> 18:06.784
And I liked you more
before the lap-band.

18:06.786 --> 18:09.287
When you were still Kimberly
with an "I."

18:09.289 --> 18:11.289
[gasping]

18:12.825 --> 18:15.827
[cheering]

18:21.133 --> 18:24.469
Max, did Han just save us?

18:24.471 --> 18:26.237
I wasn't listening,
I was putting mini-pizzas

18:26.239 --> 18:27.805
in my pocket.

18:36.148 --> 18:39.183
Girls, your shift started
40 minutes ago.

18:39.185 --> 18:43.421
What are you doing here
so early?

18:43.423 --> 18:46.257
Earl, good news.
We are now the sole owners

18:46.259 --> 18:48.426
of all those cupcake T-shirts.

18:48.428 --> 18:51.362
And, literally, nothing else.

18:51.364 --> 18:53.498
Maybe I could rent a parrot
and pick up some shifts

18:53.500 --> 18:55.900
at Long John Silver's.

18:55.902 --> 18:57.368
Hey, girls.

18:57.370 --> 18:59.403
I'm about to meet
another wedding planner.

18:59.405 --> 19:01.539
And this one's gonna be good!

19:01.541 --> 19:04.709
He's gay.

19:04.711 --> 19:06.611
Sophie Kuchenski?

19:06.613 --> 19:08.880
Yes, God!

19:08.882 --> 19:11.182
From the second I walked
in here, I said to myself,

19:11.184 --> 19:13.684
"That has to be her."
And I can see it.

19:13.686 --> 19:19.090
We're going to make
magic together.

19:19.092 --> 19:23.728
Yeah, what's gay for no?

19:23.730 --> 19:27.298
Okay.

19:27.300 --> 19:31.369
Wow, I think we just survived
a "torgaydo."

19:33.539 --> 19:37.108
Where am I gonna find another
gay wedding planner

19:37.110 --> 19:41.779
in New York now?

19:41.781 --> 19:43.281
Just throw a tantrum
in a Crate & Barrel,

19:43.283 --> 19:48.653
and five of them
will come running.

19:48.655 --> 19:51.455
Hey, nice legal work today.

19:51.457 --> 19:55.226
You should be on the
<i>Little People's Court.</i>

19:55.228 --> 19:59.497
Yeah, from now on,
I'm calling you "Hanny Cochran."

19:59.499 --> 20:01.632
Okay.
Next time you want to thank me,

20:01.634 --> 20:04.001
just send me
an Edible Arrangement.

20:04.003 --> 20:07.505
I don't know many times
I have to drop that hint.

20:07.507 --> 20:13.077
But that's just, like,
a two-inch drop.

20:13.079 --> 20:15.479
Sorry.
I can't help myself.

20:15.481 --> 20:18.449
But I'm going to try because
I know I was the bully

20:18.451 --> 20:20.851
you were talking about
in that speech.

20:20.853 --> 20:24.622
What? I was talking about
the doorwoman in my building.

20:24.624 --> 20:25.756
I have to submit
to a purple-nurple

20:25.758 --> 20:29.594
just to get my mail.

20:29.596 --> 20:31.796
There's another woman?

20:31.798 --> 20:35.433
Max, I think Han
has a side bully.

20:35.435 --> 20:37.635
Well, I'll just have
to try harder.

20:37.637 --> 20:40.371
Because if anyone is gonna
mercilessly nurple you

20:40.373 --> 20:44.642
into an early grave,
it's got to be me.

20:44.644 --> 20:47.178
I'd like to think so, Max.

20:47.180 --> 20:51.849
You'd also like to ride
in a car facing forwards.

20:53.719 --> 20:54.852
Back to normal.
