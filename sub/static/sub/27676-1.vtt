00:16.440 --> 00:20.023
(somber atmospheric music)

00:30.180 --> 00:32.630
- [Woman] We just wanted
to get away from it all.

00:34.969 --> 00:37.383
We just wanted to get
away from all the people.

00:44.970 --> 00:47.120
We just wanted to get
away from everything.

03:21.502 --> 03:24.502
(music intensifies)

03:39.652 --> 03:42.235
(light clicks)

04:04.503 --> 04:06.563
Ah, that's a terrifying sign.

04:07.517 --> 04:12.237
- It's a creepy clown man.
- Stop it. (laughs)

04:13.093 --> 04:15.547
I think they don't want
business here. (laughs)

04:15.548 --> 04:16.559
- That's the whole point.
- Yeah.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.519
- It's brilliant marketing.
- Hey, how's it going?

04:18.519 --> 04:20.307
- [Man] Oh my God.

04:20.308 --> 04:21.372
- God.

04:21.373 --> 04:23.597
It's so nice out.

04:38.230 --> 04:39.839
- You want anything?

04:39.840 --> 04:43.359
- Yeah, I think I'm gonna get
some beef jerky, but I'll be

04:43.360 --> 04:44.799
in in a second, I just
wanna hang out for a minute.

04:44.800 --> 04:45.800
- Okay.

05:01.708 --> 05:04.458
(crow screeches)

05:33.923 --> 05:35.006
- Yeah!
- Woo!

05:53.820 --> 05:55.649
- Hey, do you wanna get the normal kind,

05:55.650 --> 05:58.249
or do you wanna try some
of this local stuff?

05:58.250 --> 06:01.129
- Oh, local of course,
local's always better.

06:01.130 --> 06:03.710
- I got you some Preston Pale Ale.

06:03.711 --> 06:04.823
- Sweet.

06:06.140 --> 06:08.050
- Is that everything?
- Yeah, that'll do it.

06:08.051 --> 06:09.939
- That'll be $15.

06:09.940 --> 06:11.949
- Actually sorry, I have a question.

06:11.950 --> 06:13.529
Is there somewhere up the
road that's a little bit more

06:13.530 --> 06:16.979
secluded that we could camp
for a few days, do you know?

06:16.980 --> 06:18.869
- I'm sorry, we only take cash.

06:18.870 --> 06:19.870
- Are you serious?

06:20.810 --> 06:22.579
You guys don't take cards?

06:22.580 --> 06:23.580
Oh, that's cute.

06:24.320 --> 06:26.269
- Well, if you keep driving
up Ballard there, it'll

06:26.270 --> 06:28.729
eventually take you up
and over the mountain.

06:28.730 --> 06:31.680
I suppose you could find
somewhere along the way, probably.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.269
No one goes much further these days,

06:34.270 --> 06:35.679
since they put in the interstate.

06:35.680 --> 06:37.259
Thank you.

06:37.260 --> 06:39.089
People really come up here for the lake.

06:39.090 --> 06:41.109
- Okay, we'll check that out, thank you.

06:41.110 --> 06:42.609
- You're welcome.
- Here you go.

06:42.610 --> 06:43.610
- Oh, thanks.

06:45.973 --> 06:48.199
- Bye, have a good day.
- Thank you, you too.

06:48.200 --> 06:49.200
- Hi.

06:50.719 --> 06:53.136
(car bleeps)

06:55.930 --> 07:00.309
- So, this seems to be the spot.

07:00.310 --> 07:02.036
Do you wanna go check out the lake and--

07:02.037 --> 07:03.493
- No, I don't want to.

07:04.590 --> 07:05.723
We always do that.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.689
I wanna get away from people.

07:09.690 --> 07:11.989
Like, I don't wanna just
have to camp right next

07:11.990 --> 07:13.743
to these fucking douche bags.

07:14.740 --> 07:17.309
- But they're just trying
to have a nice time.

07:17.310 --> 07:18.310
- You're so nice.

07:20.070 --> 07:22.849
I get it, but like, I feel like they

07:22.850 --> 07:24.889
don't even appreciate that
they're out in nature.

07:24.890 --> 07:27.890
I mean, this is untouched
wilderness and they're ruining it.

07:33.270 --> 07:35.159
- You're right.
(woman chuckles)

07:35.160 --> 07:36.160
- Good answer.

07:37.410 --> 07:39.229
- But their version of
getting away is different

07:39.230 --> 07:41.029
than our version, but
ultimately they're just trying

07:41.030 --> 07:42.485
to do the same thing.

07:42.486 --> 07:43.739
- Are you serious?
- Besides!

07:43.740 --> 07:45.959
Isn't it better that they stay here?

07:45.960 --> 07:47.209
- Why?

07:47.210 --> 07:49.969
- It gives us an opportunity to be private

07:49.970 --> 07:51.723
in the big bad woods.

07:53.133 --> 07:54.133
- I guess.

07:56.580 --> 07:58.359
Did you notice they were buying PBR?

07:58.360 --> 07:59.759
- I did.

07:59.760 --> 08:02.649
- So gross.
- The youth these days.

08:02.650 --> 08:03.659
It's upsetting.

08:03.660 --> 08:05.923
- I can't believe they put
that shit in their body.

08:13.788 --> 08:15.029
Mm, this is really good.

08:15.030 --> 08:16.659
- [Man] Will you please
turn on some music?

08:16.660 --> 08:18.569
- [Woman] Oh, sure,
you're gonna let me deej?

08:18.570 --> 08:21.347
- DJ Lori in the house.
- Cool.

08:21.348 --> 08:22.896
Oh, we haven't listened
to this in a while.

08:22.897 --> 08:24.873
I love this CD, I forgot about it.

11:00.220 --> 11:02.629
- Okay, so...

11:02.630 --> 11:06.209
Up this trail, there's like
a small river or a stream,

11:06.210 --> 11:08.398
that we could find a
place to camp up there.

11:08.399 --> 11:11.679
- I bet they took better
care of this trail

11:11.680 --> 11:13.913
before the fucking Bush administration.

11:15.030 --> 11:16.319
- Yeah, right?

11:16.320 --> 11:18.269
- You know, maybe that
works in our favor, though.

11:18.270 --> 11:21.049
It'll discourage people
from coming up here.

11:21.050 --> 11:22.750
- Yeah, will you lock it?
- Yeah.

11:24.879 --> 11:27.296
(car bleeps)

11:29.250 --> 11:32.667
(dark atmospheric music)

12:02.777 --> 12:05.444
(fire crackles)

12:06.760 --> 12:07.760
This is it.

12:10.830 --> 12:12.873
This is how man was supposed to live.

12:14.550 --> 12:15.550
Just...

12:17.150 --> 12:19.143
Surviving in the wilderness.

12:22.510 --> 12:27.510
All he needs is a fire,
a knife, and his wits.

12:28.487 --> 12:31.154
(Lori chuckles)

12:32.760 --> 12:34.023
- Also, bratwurst.

12:34.880 --> 12:37.907
Do we have any more?
- Fuckin' bratwurst, yeah.

12:40.572 --> 12:43.640
They are so good.
- Oh, sweet, thank you.

12:43.641 --> 12:46.619
Pulling it off the ground.
- There you go.

12:46.620 --> 12:49.349
What kind do you want, do
you want chicken and basil,

12:49.350 --> 12:52.533
or red pepper?
- Oh, red pepper.

12:54.092 --> 12:57.609
- Lori, something spicy before bed?

12:57.610 --> 12:59.160
You'll have nightmares.

12:59.161 --> 13:01.299
- You know how I love
spicy things before bed.

13:01.300 --> 13:05.049
- Well, then Lori gets something spicy.

13:05.050 --> 13:08.293
- Don't wag your wiener at me.
(man laughs)

13:13.550 --> 13:15.200
You got that? You need some help?

13:16.662 --> 13:19.162
(man giggles)

13:22.840 --> 13:25.159
Um, woops, I killed it.

13:25.160 --> 13:26.883
- Oh-oh.
- Sorry.

13:29.081 --> 13:30.449
(distant gun fires)
(gasps)

13:30.450 --> 13:31.450
Did you hear that?

13:35.480 --> 13:38.199
- Probably just teenagers
shootin' beer cans.

13:38.200 --> 13:39.350
- All the way out here?

13:40.620 --> 13:42.229
- [Man] Unfortunately, we're
probably not the only people

13:42.230 --> 13:43.980
who come out here.
- Are you sure?

13:49.200 --> 13:52.393
It's probably those fucking
kids from the store earlier.

13:53.370 --> 13:55.699
I thought that they had guns on them.

13:55.700 --> 13:57.619
They're probably tracking you.

13:57.620 --> 13:59.999
'Cause they're douche bag trackers.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.059
- Aww, that's beautiful.
- And you're a douche bag.

14:03.060 --> 14:04.539
No, you're not.

14:04.540 --> 14:07.170
- Well, maybe they got
all horned and tuned up

14:08.080 --> 14:11.559
from drinking PBR and
drivin' their trucks around.

14:11.560 --> 14:14.859
Came out here for a hot
little piece of ass.

14:14.860 --> 14:16.389
- Well, they came to the right place

14:16.390 --> 14:18.313
for a hot little piece of ass.

14:19.630 --> 14:21.719
Yours.
(man laughs)

14:21.720 --> 14:22.680
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.

14:22.681 --> 14:24.859
I could tell they liked you.

14:24.860 --> 14:26.035
- I work out.

14:26.036 --> 14:28.453
(both laugh)

14:29.298 --> 14:31.075
- Oh.

14:31.076 --> 14:33.073
Honey, you don't work out.
- No.

14:34.260 --> 14:36.038
- I'm sorry, I can't keep it lit.

14:36.039 --> 14:36.872
- [Man] Here, I got it.

14:36.873 --> 14:39.083
- I've wasted like $40
worth of weed already.

14:42.720 --> 14:44.983
- Yeah, you did.
- I hate my book.

14:46.960 --> 14:49.833
I already read it like
12 times when I was 19.

14:50.930 --> 14:52.339
By other authors.

14:52.340 --> 14:54.339
- [Man] You should play on your phone.

14:54.340 --> 14:56.259
- I hate playing on my
phone and I can't find it.

14:56.260 --> 14:58.689
Stop reminding me of that.

14:58.690 --> 14:59.959
- My phone died when we got out here.

14:59.960 --> 15:01.579
- Oh, that's convenient.

15:01.580 --> 15:04.333
How have you even, have you been okay?

15:05.780 --> 15:07.509
- I'm surviving.
- You are.

15:07.510 --> 15:09.769
All you need is your knife.
- True.

15:09.770 --> 15:10.770
- Yeah.

15:12.540 --> 15:13.749
- I guess we're just gonna have to have

15:13.750 --> 15:16.050
an old-fashioned conversation.
- Oh, awkward.

15:21.748 --> 15:23.209
You cold?
- A little bit.

15:23.210 --> 15:25.683
- Oh, I can warm you up.

15:29.018 --> 15:31.168
I don't have anything
to talk to you about.

15:32.479 --> 15:34.279
Is it good to throw dirt on the fire?

15:34.280 --> 15:36.569
- If you wanna put it out.
(Lori laughs)

15:36.570 --> 15:37.829
First fire, first time?

15:37.830 --> 15:38.820
- Did you just say "tell me about you?"

15:38.821 --> 15:40.157
- Tell me about you.

15:42.508 --> 15:45.132
(laughs)

15:45.133 --> 15:47.429
- [Lori] Oh god, we could play Balderdash.

15:47.430 --> 15:48.519
- [Man] Balderdash.

15:48.520 --> 15:49.679
- [Lori] Remember when we
played that when we were

15:49.680 --> 15:52.779
getting STD tests?
- Yes, yeah.

15:52.780 --> 15:55.193
You were really good. (laughs)

15:56.090 --> 15:57.273
- [Lori] Just leave me alone.

15:58.950 --> 16:01.269
You seriously think those gunshots were,

16:01.270 --> 16:02.920
you're not worried at all?
- No.

16:04.390 --> 16:07.462
- [Lori] You didn't even jump,
just like, "yep, gunshots."

16:07.463 --> 16:11.662
- [Man] Ah, you know, I'm
a little high. (laughs)

16:11.663 --> 16:15.080
(fire crackles and pops)

16:30.599 --> 16:35.599
(distant gun fires)
(tense atmospheric music)

16:37.056 --> 16:42.056
(muffled footsteps)
(heavy breaths)

17:12.482 --> 17:15.648
(man grunts)

17:15.650 --> 17:17.686
- Come on.
- Fuck!

17:17.688 --> 17:19.800
What the fuck, who are you?

17:19.800 --> 17:20.800
Lori, Lori!

17:22.661 --> 17:25.411
(muffled groans)

17:39.716 --> 17:42.466
(muffled groans)

17:58.837 --> 18:01.587
(muffled groans)

18:59.459 --> 19:02.042
(muffled sobs)

19:45.261 --> 19:50.261
(muffled groans)
(music intensifies)

21:10.381 --> 21:15.381
(dark atmospheric music)
(Lori pants softly)

22:31.733 --> 22:34.733
(distant gun fires)

23:38.387 --> 23:41.470
(eerie string music)

23:48.883 --> 23:51.300
(Lori pants)

24:18.425 --> 24:20.925
(Lori groans)

24:24.006 --> 24:26.423
(Lori pants)

24:30.817 --> 24:32.234
- [Lori] Oh, god!

24:40.651 --> 24:42.651
(pants)

24:55.955 --> 25:00.955
(husband's muffled groans)
(dark string music)

26:11.249 --> 26:16.249
(husband groans)
(man grunts)

26:57.253 --> 27:00.753
(husband whines and sobs)

27:22.082 --> 27:24.832
(husband grunts)

27:40.550 --> 27:43.133
(husband sobs)

28:00.063 --> 28:04.396
(husband's muffled sobs and whines)

28:56.343 --> 28:59.010
(steel scrapes)

29:07.975 --> 29:11.392
(dark atmospheric music)

30:53.412 --> 30:57.912
(wood creaks)
(gasps)

31:02.033 --> 31:07.033
(dark atmospheric music)
(heavy breaths)

31:18.481 --> 31:20.898
(flies buzz)

31:33.360 --> 31:38.360
(water trickles)
(captor hums)

32:01.765 --> 32:05.598
- Papa wouldn't be likin'
what you done today.

32:11.280 --> 32:12.603
He always told you...

32:15.570 --> 32:18.083
Never let the food get away.

32:20.336 --> 32:23.433
When you get hungry,
what are you gonna eat?

32:25.965 --> 32:27.882
What are you gonna eat?

32:40.472 --> 32:42.389
What are you gonna eat?

32:54.431 --> 32:59.431
Momma was good to you.

32:59.433 --> 33:01.516
She was real good to you.

33:04.884 --> 33:06.217
I'm good to you.

33:12.159 --> 33:14.492
Your brother is good to you.

33:22.872 --> 33:27.872
I'll get you all clean.

33:28.291 --> 33:32.553
We'll get you down there,
you get that fire goin' down,

33:34.912 --> 33:38.437
down the smoke room, and
we'll get that meat goin'.

33:39.872 --> 33:44.872
(younger brother pants)
(tense atmospheric tones)

34:19.350 --> 34:21.163
Make sure that fire stays lit.

34:22.010 --> 34:23.513
You don't do good in a cold.

34:25.060 --> 34:28.583
Be gone for a few, just goin'
into town to drop this jerky.

34:32.800 --> 34:34.809
You make sure that smoker's ready to go,

34:34.810 --> 34:36.322
for when I be gettin' back.

35:00.720 --> 35:03.303

(Lori pants)

41:58.752 --> 42:02.169
(dark atmospheric music)

42:06.748 --> 42:08.398
- Thank you so much for stopping.

42:09.540 --> 42:11.440
Oh, Jesus Christ, you're a life saver.

42:12.920 --> 42:14.969
I can't even begin to tell you

42:14.970 --> 42:16.520
how badly I needed you to stop.

42:42.753 --> 42:43.753
I'm Lori.

42:45.960 --> 42:47.563
- A man's gotta eat.
- Right.

42:54.720 --> 42:56.085
Look, man, I'm really hurt, do you--

42:56.086 --> 42:58.369
- [Older Brother] If you
wanna live, you gotta eat.

42:58.370 --> 43:00.803
Ain't no time to be a sissy boy.

43:04.320 --> 43:05.320
- Yeah.

43:07.210 --> 43:08.729
Can you just take me to a town or like,

43:08.730 --> 43:10.393
a phone nearby or something?

43:12.795 --> 43:14.719
- Yep.
- Okay, thank you so much.

43:14.720 --> 43:15.720
That's great.

43:23.080 --> 43:26.069
Fucking kids, I was out
camping and I got shot

43:26.070 --> 43:29.849
by some stupid kid's stray bullet.

43:29.850 --> 43:31.159
I have no fucking clue where I am.

43:31.160 --> 43:32.369
I don't know where my husband is.

43:32.370 --> 43:33.709
I haven't seen anyone all day long.

43:33.710 --> 43:35.660
You're the first person that I've seen.

44:01.345 --> 44:04.762
(dark atmospheric music)

44:09.516 --> 44:11.516
(sighs)

44:13.137 --> 44:14.137
Oh, god.

45:47.343 --> 45:48.760
- [Husband] Lori!

46:08.075 --> 46:10.658
(light buzzes)

46:23.525 --> 46:28.525
(light buzzes)
(heavy breaths)

46:37.422 --> 46:42.422
(dark atmospheric music)
(birds squawk)

46:54.650 --> 46:57.317
- (groans) God.

47:05.093 --> 47:06.353
(door slams)

47:06.354 --> 47:07.687
It's right here?

47:27.394 --> 47:29.061
Do you have a phone?

47:30.977 --> 47:34.918
Do you have a phone? I
need to make a phone call.

47:34.919 --> 47:36.323
Do you have a fucking phone?

47:37.407 --> 47:38.407
Is it over here?

47:46.167 --> 47:48.147
I don't see a fucking phone.

47:48.148 --> 47:49.776
Oh, god.

47:49.777 --> 47:50.949
- Frank, Frank.

47:50.950 --> 47:52.889
Now, boy, boy, settle down.

47:52.890 --> 47:54.519
Don't wanna frighten her.

47:54.520 --> 47:57.867
Set your bowl, set her down, set her down.

47:57.868 --> 47:58.725
That a boy.

47:58.726 --> 47:59.729
- [Lori] I don't know what
the fuck you guys are doing.

47:59.730 --> 48:00.759
I just need to make a phone call.

48:00.760 --> 48:03.038
- [Older Brother] Frank,
come on over this way.

48:03.039 --> 48:06.129
- Lori!
- Over here, calm down, Frank.

48:06.130 --> 48:08.639
We don't want no fear runnin'
through our meat and bones.

48:08.640 --> 48:11.816
Come over here, come here, boy, you hear?

48:11.817 --> 48:16.817
- Chris, you're in here?
(shouting over each other)

48:16.899 --> 48:19.599
(Frank shouts)

48:19.600 --> 48:22.178
(Lori yelps)
- Here, no!

48:22.179 --> 48:23.346
Get over here!

48:24.659 --> 48:25.659
Get...

48:31.175 --> 48:33.258
(grunts)

48:35.853 --> 48:36.853
It's alright.

48:39.660 --> 48:40.949
She'll be back.

48:40.950 --> 48:41.950
She's wounded.

48:43.590 --> 48:45.340
I know she'll be back for her mate.

48:57.854 --> 49:01.437
(somber atmospheric music)

49:04.899 --> 49:07.649

50:39.206 --> 50:40.595

50:40.596 --> 50:41.596
Oh, god.

50:45.526 --> 50:47.609
(groans)

52:36.801 --> 52:39.739
It's okay, Chris, it's okay,
it's okay, I'm here, I'm here.

52:39.740 --> 52:42.488
It's alright, it's okay, you'll be okay.

52:42.489 --> 52:45.029
It's okay, it's okay, I'm
right here, I've got you.

52:45.030 --> 52:47.399
I've got you, I'm right
here, I've got you.

52:47.400 --> 52:51.008
(Chris sobs)
I'm here now, it's alright.

52:51.009 --> 52:52.009
It's okay.

52:53.369 --> 52:55.197
It's okay, it's alright.

(dark atmospheric music)
(background clacks and clinks)

53:49.721 --> 53:51.304
- You a feisty one.

53:57.247 --> 53:59.053
I'm gonna like taking care of you.

54:00.682 --> 54:02.932
(chuckles)

54:36.100 --> 54:37.759
You ain't been nothin' but trouble

54:37.760 --> 54:39.460
since you walked through the door.

54:40.350 --> 54:41.496
I knew it was too good
to be true for you to be

54:41.497 --> 54:43.743
walkin' into the dinner table like that.

54:53.684 --> 54:56.351
(steel scrapes)

55:01.920 --> 55:04.520
My daddy always said, "you
gotta eat what you kill."

55:06.830 --> 55:08.630
That's how man was supposed to live.

55:11.800 --> 55:14.657
Just surviving out in the wilderness.

55:18.240 --> 55:20.610
All you need is a fire and a knife.

55:29.040 --> 55:30.337
I reckon he knew a lot.

55:40.130 --> 55:42.763
My brother Arvis is gonna
be real happy with me.

55:44.960 --> 55:46.157
See what good I done.

55:47.390 --> 55:50.713
I got all this meat
a-smokin' for his next batch.

55:52.250 --> 55:56.073
My brother's gonna be real
happy with me. (chuckles)

56:02.707 --> 56:05.830
"Idle hands are the devil's
workshop," Arvis says.

56:07.587 --> 56:09.393
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

56:14.300 --> 56:15.733
Why are you doing this?

56:19.452 --> 56:21.052
The fuck is the matter with you?

56:31.872 --> 56:35.219
What the fuck is the matter with you?

56:35.220 --> 56:37.983
You and your brother are fucking psychos!

56:40.102 --> 56:41.352
What kind of man are you?

56:43.622 --> 56:45.893
Your brother's a fucking backwoods idiot.

56:48.810 --> 56:50.363
Why are you doing this to us?

56:57.380 --> 56:59.473
What kind of man does this shit?

57:05.684 --> 57:06.644
What the fuck?

57:06.645 --> 57:10.662
You guys are like inbred fucking morons!

57:10.663 --> 57:11.541
(Frank moans)

57:11.542 --> 57:14.779
Fuck you, what the fuck is wrong with you?

57:14.780 --> 57:16.363
You fucking weirdo!

57:17.500 --> 57:19.083
I fucking hate you!

57:20.666 --> 57:25.666
I hope you fucking die!
(Frank moans)

57:26.649 --> 57:28.888
Fuck you, take us down from here!

57:28.889 --> 57:32.389
What the fuck's wrong with you, let us go!

We just wanted to get away.

01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:04.023
To be alone.

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:07.820
We just wanted...

01:05:09.533 --> 01:05:10.843
To be removed from it all.
