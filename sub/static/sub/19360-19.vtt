<i>This week on</i> Vice:

00:08.483 --> 00:11.852
<i>Corruption over oil threatens
the world's newest nation.</i>

00:13.022 --> 00:14.988
This is not the country
we fought for.

00:15.024 --> 00:19.258
People are upset about where
we have found ourselves.

00:19.294 --> 00:21.461
This fence here
is the only thing

00:21.496 --> 00:24.397
separating these people
from the attacks that happen

00:24.433 --> 00:25.532
right out there.

00:26.601 --> 00:28.635
<i>And then,
inside the controversy</i>

00:28.670 --> 00:32.171
<i>over resources on
tribal land in America.</i>

00:33.507 --> 00:37.109
You're looking at a group
of unpaid social objectors

00:37.145 --> 00:39.445
versus one of the wealthiest
industries in the world.

00:39.480 --> 00:44.150
More oil has been sold here than
all the gold rushes put together.

00:50.725 --> 00:52.090
Go, go, go!

00:39.480 --> 00:44.150
More oil has been sold here than
all the gold rushes put together.

01:07.807 --> 01:10.976
Oil was first discovered
in the south of Sudan

01:11.011 --> 01:13.245
by Chevron in 1978.

01:13.280 --> 01:15.313
<i>Now, that discovery
quickly ignited</i>

01:15.349 --> 01:18.850
<i>a long-running civil war
with the north.</i>

01:18.886 --> 01:22.320
<i>And for the next 22 years, the
south, which had most of the oil,</i>

01:22.356 --> 01:25.322
<i>fought the government in the north,
which took most of the wealth.</i>

01:25.358 --> 01:27.358
<i>By the time it was over,</i>

01:27.394 --> 01:29.494
<i>more than two million
people were dead</i>

01:29.529 --> 01:31.896
<i>and more than three million,
displaced.</i>

01:31.931 --> 01:34.832
<i>But six years ago,
the people of South Sudan</i>

01:34.868 --> 01:38.403
<i>voted almost unanimously
to break away from the north,</i>

01:38.438 --> 01:40.504
<i>becoming the world's
newest country.</i>

01:40.539 --> 01:43.040
<i>The US played
an instrumental role,</i>

01:43.075 --> 01:45.542
sending close
to $11 billion in aid.

01:45.577 --> 01:48.712
<i>For the first
time, the people of South Sudan</i>

01:48.747 --> 01:52.616
<i>had a chance to benefit from their
wealth of natural resources.</i>

01:52.651 --> 01:55.019
But now, the south
may be falling victim

01:55.054 --> 01:57.120
to the so-called
"resource curse."

02:14.105 --> 02:17.206
How many patients on average
do you have here coming in?

02:20.045 --> 02:22.111
<i>Maker Isaac
is the director</i>

02:22.147 --> 02:23.046
<i>of the main hospital</i>

02:23.081 --> 02:25.848
<i>for South Sudan's
12 million people.</i>

02:27.218 --> 02:29.718
Broken bone? Ooh, that's
a bad break.

02:29.754 --> 02:31.386
He's very skinny.

02:31.422 --> 02:32.822
Yeah.
Is that normal?

02:38.195 --> 02:39.328
Oh, I see.

02:40.531 --> 02:42.331
So, there's no food
at all in the hospital?

02:42.366 --> 02:43.899
That must be difficult

02:43.935 --> 02:47.436
when a lot of people are here
for malnutrition reasons,

02:47.471 --> 02:49.637
or for dehydration and such.
Yes. Yes.

02:59.649 --> 03:00.849
What's she in here for?

03:03.520 --> 03:06.120
It seems like getting
treatment is quite difficult.

03:12.996 --> 03:15.229
<i>Without food,
medicine, or electricity,</i>

03:15.264 --> 03:19.300
<i>South Sudan's largest hospital
is clearly failing its patients.</i>

03:19.335 --> 03:20.868
Do you have enough funding here

03:20.903 --> 03:23.704
for you guys to get paid
and everything? No?

03:25.475 --> 03:26.640
How much?

03:26.675 --> 03:27.808
Less that $30.
Yeah.

03:27.843 --> 03:29.943
And you're the director of the hospital?
Yeah. Yeah.

03:33.749 --> 03:34.848
Why?

03:37.653 --> 03:41.187
<i> While South Sudan struggles
to provide the most basic services,</i>

03:41.223 --> 03:45.392
<i>it's sitting on some of the largest
oil reserves on the continent.</i>

03:47.396 --> 03:48.795
<i>Madding Ngor is a journalist</i>

03:48.831 --> 03:50.831
<i>whose family members
fought and died</i>

03:50.866 --> 03:52.432
<i>in the war for independence.</i>

03:52.467 --> 03:54.300
The economy is struggling,

03:54.336 --> 03:57.137
because the oil prices
are declining.

03:57.172 --> 04:02.575
And South Sudan is a country that is
almost entirely dependent on oil.

04:02.610 --> 04:04.944
It has tremendous effect.

04:04.979 --> 04:06.712
<i>In this oilproducing country,</i>

04:06.748 --> 04:09.314
<i>it's actually almost
impossible to buy gas.</i>

04:09.350 --> 04:11.316
There's a big
fuel shortage here?

04:11.352 --> 04:12.752
It's huge.
It's immense.

04:12.787 --> 04:16.721
Seeing all these people queuing
up, to try and fill up their tanks,

04:16.757 --> 04:18.724
is that how
everyone gets their fuel?

04:18.760 --> 04:20.959
It's crazy. Let
me tell you on record,

04:20.995 --> 04:23.162
I waited for 10 hours.
10 hours?

04:23.197 --> 04:24.763
10 hours,
and I didn't get it.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.398
So, where's everyone
getting their fuel?

04:26.434 --> 04:28.400
There is the black market.

04:28.436 --> 04:31.670
So, these guys are all selling gas?
Yeah. Let's see.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.820
<i>A single bottle
of fuel costs more</i>

04:48.855 --> 04:51.923
<i>than the monthly salary
of most people in South Sudan.</i>

04:51.959 --> 04:56.561
<i>Despite at least three and a half
billion barrels in oil reserves,</i>

04:56.597 --> 04:58.829
<i>the economy is
now completely crippled,</i>

04:58.864 --> 05:02.866
<i>a far cry from what was expected when
the country gained its independence.</i>

05:05.371 --> 05:08.005
- Were you here on Independence Day?
- Absolutely.

05:08.040 --> 05:10.674
I was here, and this place

05:10.710 --> 05:12.110
was filled up with people.

05:30.895 --> 05:33.396
This was the only time
in our history

05:33.432 --> 05:36.899
where we came together,
despite our differences,

05:36.935 --> 05:39.869
<i>whether they were tribal,
whether they were political,</i>

05:39.904 --> 05:41.571
<i>whether they were economical.</i>

05:41.607 --> 05:43.640
<i>All kinds of people where here.</i>

05:51.850 --> 05:53.650
<i>Just like a wedding night,</i>

05:53.685 --> 05:56.986
when the honeymoon fades,
the real problems, they kick in.

05:59.124 --> 06:01.157
<i>And it was just
a matter of three years.</i>

06:01.192 --> 06:04.226
<i>and the country erupted in war.</i>

06:04.262 --> 06:09.097
<i>December 15, 2013, there was
a brewing power struggle.</i>

06:09.133 --> 06:12.934
<i>between Salva Kiir Mayardit,
president of South Sudan...</i>

06:16.774 --> 06:20.108
<i>...and Riek Machar, the
former first vice president.</i>

06:23.881 --> 06:27.515
<i>And of course at the center
of power, is oil, is money.</i>

06:27.551 --> 06:30.952
<i>It became a conflict
along tribal lines:</i>

06:30.988 --> 06:33.254
<i>the Dinka, where the
president comes from,</i>

06:33.290 --> 06:37.725
<i>and the Nuer, where the former
first vice president comes from--</i>

06:37.760 --> 06:40.495
<i>and that engulfed
the whole country.</i>

06:40.530 --> 06:42.963
<i>With the country's
two largest tribes divided</i>

06:42.999 --> 06:45.866
<i>by their loyalty to the president
and the vice president,</i>

06:45.902 --> 06:50.071
<i>the world's newest country
split along ethnic lines.</i>

06:50.106 --> 06:52.106
<i> This is not the
country we fought for.</i>

06:52.141 --> 06:54.341
We were fighting for a future

06:54.376 --> 06:57.544
where there is a peace,
there is a stability,

06:57.580 --> 06:59.279
there is prosperity.

06:59.315 --> 07:02.083
So, indeed, people are upset

07:02.118 --> 07:05.652
<i>about where we have found
ourselves in the country.</i>

07:07.590 --> 07:09.923
<i>In 2016,</i>

07:09.958 --> 07:11.291
<i>a team of investigators</i>

07:11.327 --> 07:12.693
<i>backed by George Clooney--</i>

07:12.728 --> 07:14.361
<i>who's been an activist
in this region</i>

07:14.396 --> 07:15.329
<i>for over a decade--</i>

07:15.364 --> 07:17.764
<i>published a two-year long
investigation</i>

07:17.799 --> 07:19.366
<i>into South Sudan's leaders.</i>

07:19.401 --> 07:21.702
This morning,
we're prepared to give evidence

07:21.737 --> 07:23.770
of massive criminal behavior

07:23.805 --> 07:26.940
by the president of South Sudan

07:26.975 --> 07:30.543
and by his opposition,
the ousted vice president.

07:30.578 --> 07:32.245
<i>They concluded
that at the root</i>

07:32.280 --> 07:34.280
<i>of the power struggle
is a fierce battle</i>

07:34.315 --> 07:36.482
<i>over control
of the state's assets.</i>

07:36.517 --> 07:39.318
<i>They're stealing the
money to fund their militias,</i>

07:39.354 --> 07:41.888
to attack and kill one another.

07:41.923 --> 07:44.223
<i>South Sudan's leaders
and their relatives</i>

07:44.259 --> 07:45.958
<i>were getting rich
off lucrative deals</i>

07:45.993 --> 07:47.960
<i>in the oil and mining industries</i>

07:47.995 --> 07:52.164
<i>while the country was driven
into war and famine.</i>

07:52.199 --> 07:55.434
<i>Fourteen-year-old Bol is among
the nearly two million people</i>

07:55.470 --> 07:57.069
<i>who were forced from their homes</i>

07:57.104 --> 07:59.337
<i>and now scattered
across South Sudan.</i>

08:00.207 --> 08:01.539
How did you get here?

08:14.889 --> 08:16.621
Do you think
about your family a lot?

08:25.965 --> 08:27.599
<i>To find out
how the ongoing war</i>

08:27.634 --> 08:29.967
<i>is affecting civilians
outside of Juba,</i>

08:30.003 --> 08:32.535
<i>we flew north,
crossing ethnic lines</i>

08:32.571 --> 08:34.738
<i>to the tribal home
of the opposition.</i>

08:35.842 --> 08:38.876
<i>More than 120,000 ethnic Nuers</i>

08:38.912 --> 08:42.346
<i>are now living inside
this one barbed-wire camp.</i>

08:42.381 --> 08:46.050
<i>UN peacekeepers protect them
from their own government.</i>

08:46.085 --> 08:49.386
<i> Half
of them are children like Isaac,</i>

08:49.422 --> 08:52.356
<i>who fled ethnic slaughter
by government soldiers.</i>

09:03.469 --> 09:04.568
Did you lose anyone?

09:15.247 --> 09:17.981
Have you talked to anyone
about how you feel?

09:18.016 --> 09:20.650
I mean, I can tell you're...

09:20.685 --> 09:23.185
upset and you're thinking
about your brother.

09:38.169 --> 09:40.569
We just climbed up to
the edge of the POC site,

09:40.604 --> 09:45.140
and from up here you can see how
absolutely humongous this site is.

09:46.577 --> 09:48.944
In fact, it's the third
largest city in South Sudan.

09:48.980 --> 09:52.214
And this fence here is the only
thing separating these people

09:52.250 --> 09:56.651
from the attacks and killings and
atrocities that happen right out there.

09:59.256 --> 10:02.457
<i>Even inside the camps,
food is scarce.</i>

10:02.493 --> 10:05.159
<i>Civilians, mostly women,
are forced to leave</i>

10:05.195 --> 10:07.696
<i>the camp every day
to collect firewood,</i>

10:07.731 --> 10:10.064
<i>which they can then sell
to purchase food.</i>

10:16.572 --> 10:19.807
So it takes four or five hours to
reach the place where you're going?

10:23.479 --> 10:26.414
What are the biggest threats
when you go out to collect wood?

10:42.331 --> 10:44.531
Who is it that's
beating and raping?

10:50.005 --> 10:53.773
<i> Both the UN and the African
Union have documented cases</i>

10:53.809 --> 10:58.078
<i>of mass rape of civilians and even
children by government soldiers.</i>

11:02.717 --> 11:04.183
We're with the UN mission
in South Sudan,

11:04.218 --> 11:06.018
just out
with the Mongolian battalion.

11:06.054 --> 11:10.423
The security situation around Nhialdiu
has been pretty precarious recently,

11:10.459 --> 11:12.926
and so, these peacekeepers are
frequently having to head out

11:12.961 --> 11:15.628
on patrols to go
and assess what's going on.

11:15.664 --> 11:21.800
<i>The territory around the camp has changed
hands several times during the conflict.</i>

11:21.836 --> 11:25.171
<i>Right now, it's government soldiers
that are controlling this town.</i>

11:25.206 --> 11:29.875
There are so many soldiers loitering
around this one tiny little village,

11:29.910 --> 11:33.612
and several extremely
young-looking kids with guns.

11:33.647 --> 11:35.347
<i>According to the UN,
there are more</i>

11:35.382 --> 11:38.951
<i>than 17,000 child soldiers
involved in the conflict,</i>

11:38.986 --> 11:40.986
<i>and that number is growing.</i>

11:42.590 --> 11:45.190
<i>With one of the largest
peacekeeping missions</i>

11:45.225 --> 11:46.892
<i>protecting hundreds of thousands</i>

11:46.927 --> 11:49.027
<i>from their own government,
we sat down</i>

11:49.062 --> 11:51.196
<i>with the country's
minister of information.</i>

11:51.231 --> 11:52.663
<i>Michael Lueth belongs</i>

11:52.699 --> 11:55.467
<i>to the small circle
of presidential elites.</i>

11:55.502 --> 11:58.403
<i>The US recent attempted
to slap sanctions on him</i>

11:58.438 --> 12:01.306
<i>for orchestrating
the slaughter of civilians.</i>

12:01.341 --> 12:06.177
Can you explain what the current state
of South Sudan is in your eyes?

12:07.146 --> 12:09.580
Well, the current state
of South Sudan

12:09.616 --> 12:12.850
in terms of human rights
is... is okay.

12:12.886 --> 12:16.420
You say it's okay. I mean, there's...
almost three million people

12:16.455 --> 12:18.055
displaced throughout
South Sudan,

12:18.090 --> 12:22.459
and about 200,000 of those are living
within IDP camps within their own country.

12:22.495 --> 12:25.662
Were they displaced because
of human rights violations?

12:25.697 --> 12:27.097
Yes.
No.

12:27.133 --> 12:29.199
There are widespread reports
throughout the country,

12:29.235 --> 12:33.770
and outside of the country, of
killings, of brutal mass-rapes.

12:33.805 --> 12:37.007
These are reports from independent
people, from individuals,

12:37.043 --> 12:39.543
from humanitarian groups from the UN.

12:39.578 --> 12:42.012
These are not credible reports.

12:42.047 --> 12:44.981
These are reports which are
written here in the hotels.

12:45.017 --> 12:48.852
I mean, it sounds like you're saying that
the government accepts zero responsibility

12:48.887 --> 12:51.955
for any of the atrocities that have
happened throughout your country.

12:51.990 --> 12:54.624
If you don't accept any
of that responsibility,

12:54.660 --> 12:57.893
it's incredibly difficult to see
how peace could ever be reached,

12:57.929 --> 12:59.828
if there's
no accountability at all.

12:59.864 --> 13:04.067
I'm not saying that there had never
been any offenses committed.

13:04.869 --> 13:06.469
Yes, there are
offenses committed.

13:06.504 --> 13:09.144
People are under arrest-- people are
under arrest... By your people.

13:09.174 --> 13:10.773
...and they are
under investigation.

13:10.808 --> 13:13.408
Others have already
undergone trial.

13:13.444 --> 13:15.143
Do you refute the fact
that South Sudan

13:15.179 --> 13:17.713
is one of the most corrupt
countries in the world?

13:17.748 --> 13:20.816
Well, corruption is
all over the world.

13:20.851 --> 13:22.618
South Sudan is
part of the world,

13:22.653 --> 13:24.987
so it cannot be free
of corruption.

13:25.022 --> 13:27.255
I'm asking you on a scale
whether South Sudan

13:27.291 --> 13:29.857
is up there as one of the most
corrupt countries in the world.

13:29.893 --> 13:32.727
South Sudan is one of the
corrupt countries in the world,

13:32.762 --> 13:34.262
not the most.

13:34.298 --> 13:36.364
Are you corrupt?
Me?

13:36.400 --> 13:39.267
No, I'm not corrupt.

13:39.303 --> 13:41.336
<i>While the government denies</i>

13:41.371 --> 13:43.805
<i>the allegations of corruption,
the fact remains</i>

13:43.840 --> 13:46.741
<i>that the same men
who tore this country apart</i>

13:46.776 --> 13:48.776
<i>remain very much in power</i>

13:48.812 --> 13:51.746
<i>while civilians continue
to pay the price.</i>

13:51.781 --> 13:55.249
<i>And it's the international community
that's left with the costly task</i>

13:55.284 --> 13:58.219
<i>of trying to hold the world's
youngest country together.</i>

13:58.254 --> 14:02.523
We're hoping that Bol, the
14-year-old kid that we met in Juba

14:02.558 --> 14:07.128
is on this plane so that he can come
and be reunified with his family.

14:11.066 --> 14:12.666
Bol, who's 14 years old,

14:12.701 --> 14:16.003
hasn't seen his family here
in Bentiu since he was 11.

14:16.038 --> 14:18.572
Does it feel good
to be back in your town?

14:21.143 --> 14:22.909
What are you most excited about?

15:19.333 --> 15:21.099
Who are these people outside?

15:29.142 --> 15:31.542
How long have you
been waiting for this day?

16:00.106 --> 16:02.272
The Dakota Access
Pipeline brought

16:02.307 --> 16:03.807
an intense wave of attention

16:03.843 --> 16:05.776
to the Standing Rock
Sioux Reservation.

16:06.879 --> 16:08.245
<i>After protesting for months,</i>

16:08.280 --> 16:11.081
<i>the opposition successfully
blocked the pipeline,</i>

16:11.117 --> 16:12.750
<i>which they saw as a great danger</i>

16:12.785 --> 16:14.784
<i>to sacred land and fresh water.</i>

16:14.819 --> 16:16.453
Under my presidency,

16:16.488 --> 16:19.256
we'll accomplish a complete

16:19.291 --> 16:21.625
American energy independence.

16:21.660 --> 16:23.226
Complete. Complete.

16:23.262 --> 16:27.130
<i> But President Donald Trump's
pro-energy, pro-pipeline platform,</i>

16:27.165 --> 16:30.166
<i>stands in direct opposition
to practically everything</i>

16:30.201 --> 16:33.335
<i>that the Standing Rock
protest has represented,</i>

16:33.371 --> 16:35.204
<i>which constitutes a new threat</i>

16:35.240 --> 16:37.606
to the future
of America's tribal lands.

16:48.952 --> 16:50.753
By the way, you'll have
to take my word for it,

16:50.788 --> 16:52.187
because I don't know
if you can see me,

16:52.222 --> 16:54.423
but we're in Standing
Rock, North Dakota.

16:54.458 --> 16:58.026
<i>We came here
in early December 2016</i>

16:58.061 --> 16:59.861
<i>at the peak
of the protest movement.</i>

16:59.897 --> 17:02.698
<i>Thousands of people
from across the country--</i>

17:02.733 --> 17:04.900
<i>native Americans,
military veterans,</i>

17:04.935 --> 17:06.667
<i>and environmental activists--</i>

17:06.703 --> 17:09.805
<i>came together here
in solidarity for one cause:</i>

17:09.839 --> 17:13.175
<i>protecting land and water
they say is under threat</i>

17:13.210 --> 17:14.675
<i>from oil and gas development.</i>

17:14.711 --> 17:16.951
I've never seen anything like
this in real life.

17:16.980 --> 17:18.980
The closest thing
I can compare it to

17:19.016 --> 17:23.184
is a scene from
<i>Game of Thrones</i> or <i> Mad Max.</i>

17:27.656 --> 17:30.625
You came prepared.
How come you have gas masks?

17:37.333 --> 17:42.303
<i> Their goal was to halt the
construction of the Dakota Access pipeline,</i>

17:42.338 --> 17:45.239
<i>whose
1,172-mile path</i>

17:45.274 --> 17:46.540
<i>runs directly through land</i>

17:46.575 --> 17:49.143
<i>which was once part of
the Great Sioux Nation,</i>

17:49.178 --> 17:51.578
<i>and to some is still
considered sacred.</i>

17:51.613 --> 17:54.147
<i>If the pipeline
were to spill oil,</i>

17:54.182 --> 17:56.383
<i>it could contaminate
the Missouri River,</i>

17:56.418 --> 18:01.087
<i>which provides drinking water for the
Standing Rock Sioux and millions of others.</i>

18:01.122 --> 18:04.023
<i>And with nearly 8,000
major pipeline incidents</i>

18:04.059 --> 18:05.659
<i>in the last three decades,</i>

18:05.694 --> 18:07.728
<i>leaders like Standing Rock
Sioux Chairman</i>

18:07.763 --> 18:10.363
<i>Dave Archambault,
felt the need to act.</i>

18:10.398 --> 18:12.332
How did the protest

18:12.367 --> 18:15.034
against the Dakota Access
pipeline begin?

18:15.070 --> 18:16.802
It wasn't overnight.

18:18.506 --> 18:21.607
<i>2003, 2006, there was
a lot of exploration</i>

18:21.642 --> 18:22.909
<i>going on in North Dakota.</i>

18:22.944 --> 18:26.379
There was
this new Bakken oil play.

18:27.314 --> 18:28.514
<i>The US Geological Survey</i>

18:28.549 --> 18:31.584
<i>is now calling the Bakken
formation the largest continuous</i>

18:31.619 --> 18:33.853
oil accumulation
it's ever assessed.

18:33.888 --> 18:36.889
<i>It led to the biggest
oil boom in American history,</i>

18:36.924 --> 18:38.924
<i>increasing domestic production</i>

18:38.959 --> 18:40.393
<i>by 87 percent</i>

18:40.428 --> 18:42.762
<i>from when President Obama
first took office</i>

18:42.797 --> 18:44.963
<i>until its peak in 2015.</i>

18:47.301 --> 18:50.869
<i>2014, we learned
the Dakota Access pipeline</i>

18:50.905 --> 18:53.571
<i>was being planned,
and we expressed our concerns,</i>

18:53.607 --> 18:57.109
<i>saying, "This pipeline is gonna
destroy a lot of our sacred places."</i>

18:57.144 --> 19:01.746
So, we filed a suit, then they
gave a notice of preconstruction.

19:03.450 --> 19:05.817
<i>There was a
sacred camp that was set up.</i>

19:05.852 --> 19:08.753
<i>And then a week later,
there's maybe six people,</i>

19:08.789 --> 19:11.956
<i>and then 12 people,
and then 30, and then 100.</i>

19:11.991 --> 19:13.825
<i>Images of clashes</i>

19:13.860 --> 19:16.027
<i>between Sioux protesters
and authorities</i>

19:16.062 --> 19:19.630
<i>sparked a wave of support from
other Native American tribes</i>

19:19.665 --> 19:23.467
<i>and environmental activists,
hoping to stop construction.</i>

19:25.871 --> 19:29.706
<i>By December, the camp had
grown to 10,000 people.</i>

19:31.244 --> 19:32.543
<i>What was it about this protest</i>

19:32.578 --> 19:34.344
<i>that became
a kind of phenomenon?</i>

19:34.379 --> 19:38.181
Like, why?
I think it's pretty simple.

19:38.216 --> 19:40.951
<i>We've been treated wrong
for so many centuries,</i>

19:40.986 --> 19:44.087
<i>that it's time to stand up.</i>

19:44.122 --> 19:47.658
<i>A lot of people
recognized that and said,</i>

19:47.693 --> 19:49.025
"We're gonna stand with you."

19:51.096 --> 19:52.362
<i>And it worked.</i>

19:52.397 --> 19:55.031
<i>While we were there,
the Obama administration</i>

19:55.067 --> 19:57.300
<i>halted the pipeline's
construction.</i>

19:57.336 --> 20:00.703
This is a huge victory
for protesters in North Dakota.

20:00.738 --> 20:03.273
<i>The Army Corps of Engineers
announced it will look</i>

20:03.308 --> 20:06.742
<i>for an alternate route for a
controversial pipeline project</i>

20:06.778 --> 20:08.444
<i>near Native American lands.</i>

20:08.480 --> 20:10.379
<i>But once in office,</i>

20:10.414 --> 20:12.915
<i>it only took four days
for Donald Trump to allow</i>

20:12.951 --> 20:15.551
<i>the project to continue
with an action of his own.</i>

20:15.587 --> 20:18.821
This is with respect
to the construction

20:18.857 --> 20:22.557
of the Dakota Access Pipeline.

20:22.593 --> 20:24.726
<i>Trump issued
executive memorandums,</i>

20:24.761 --> 20:30.199
<i>which showed support for both the Dakota
Access and Keystone XL pipelines.</i>

20:30.234 --> 20:31.433
Okay?

20:32.936 --> 20:35.337
<i> We are the original
occupants of these lands,</i>

20:35.373 --> 20:38.974
<i>and infrastructure projects
do have an impact on us.</i>

20:39.009 --> 20:43.211
<i>Economic development is
why they took our land.</i>

20:43.246 --> 20:46.347
There's no benefit
to our tribe for this pipeline.

20:47.784 --> 20:49.050
<i>All across the country,</i>

20:49.085 --> 20:51.019
<i>Native American tribes
are concerned</i>

20:51.054 --> 20:52.954
<i>about the risks
of energy extraction.</i>

20:52.990 --> 20:56.157
<i>But in Oklahoma, one tribe has
been reaping the benefits</i>

20:56.192 --> 20:57.825
<i>from their underground resources</i>

20:57.860 --> 20:58.959
<i>for over a century.</i>

21:01.631 --> 21:03.164
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to welcome you

21:03.199 --> 21:05.266
to Osage Minerals Council
regular meeting,

21:05.301 --> 21:07.235
Wednesday, January the 18th.

21:07.270 --> 21:10.104
<i>The Osage Minerals
Council oversees and manages</i>

21:10.140 --> 21:12.973
<i>the headrights to all oil,
gas, and minerals found</i>

21:13.009 --> 21:17.511
<i>underneath the nearly 1.5 million
acres that makes up the reservation.</i>

21:17.547 --> 21:19.279
<i>Everett Waller was elected</i>

21:19.314 --> 21:21.481
<i>council chairman in 2014.</i>

21:21.517 --> 21:26.286
I want the Osages
to be known as an oil tribe.

21:31.293 --> 21:33.826
I sell a product that comes
out of the wellhead

21:33.862 --> 21:36.329
<i>at approximately $50 a barrel,</i>

21:36.365 --> 21:38.731
<i>but every dollar I make
under royalty</i>

21:38.767 --> 21:40.167
<i>is delivered to the owner.</i>

21:40.202 --> 21:43.503
So the Osage are able to dictate
where people can and cannot drill.

21:43.539 --> 21:45.672
Welcome to my reservation, yes.

21:45.707 --> 21:47.339
So, the Osage are pretty unique

21:47.375 --> 21:50.409
in how much control you have
over your mineral wealth.

21:50.445 --> 21:53.846
We give the credit
to my great-great-grandfather.

21:53.882 --> 21:57.917
<i>His name was
Watiankah the Mighty.</i>

21:57.953 --> 22:01.220
<i>He saw this vision
about our future.</i>

22:01.255 --> 22:04.557
He saw metal flying
and then running on the ground.

22:04.592 --> 22:08.427
<i>This was back when there were
Lincoln Logs and stuff like that.</i>

22:08.463 --> 22:10.829
<i>But we had someone
with enough foresight</i>

22:10.864 --> 22:12.764
<i>to ask in our treaty rights</i>

22:12.800 --> 22:15.434
<i>that we wanted everything
under the ground.</i>

22:15.470 --> 22:17.703
<i>We struck oil in 1898.</i>

22:17.738 --> 22:20.338
<i>Once it was found,
everyone come down</i>

22:20.373 --> 22:22.574
<i>to get their fortune
like a gold rush.</i>

22:22.610 --> 22:26.812
More oil has been sold here than
all gold rushes put together.

22:26.847 --> 22:28.680
Figures suggest some 20 percent

22:28.716 --> 22:31.483
of America's fossil fuels
are on reservation land.

22:31.518 --> 22:32.851
Imagine that.

22:32.886 --> 22:36.053
<i>I'm representing one of the
richest tribes in the world.</i>

22:36.089 --> 22:37.822
<i>We own the oil.
We own the gas.</i>

22:37.857 --> 22:39.090
<i>It's worth billions.</i>

22:39.126 --> 22:41.359
<i>We haven't even hit
the helium yet.</i>

22:41.394 --> 22:43.628
<i>That's gonna be worth
a trillion dollars.</i>

22:43.663 --> 22:46.764
<i> Up at Standing Rock, it seems
like the last thing anybody wants</i>

22:46.799 --> 22:48.533
is to be in bed
with energy companies,

22:48.568 --> 22:52.703
and yet, arguably, that's what's
served the Osage so well.

22:52.739 --> 22:55.906
I'm wondering,
what the Osage position is

22:55.942 --> 22:59.543
on reconciling the relationship
with the energy companies

22:59.578 --> 23:05.315
with belief in the sanctity of land,
trying to protect your reservation.

23:05.351 --> 23:07.651
We understand the sacred land.

23:07.686 --> 23:11.522
We are one of the best custodians
there is on the planet

23:11.557 --> 23:14.824
of trying to retrieve
this fossil fuel

23:14.860 --> 23:16.760
and not damage Mother Earth.

23:16.795 --> 23:19.062
<i>But that wasn't
always the case.</i>

23:19.097 --> 23:21.064
<i>The Osage Tribal Council fired</i>

23:21.099 --> 23:23.333
<i>former environmental inspector
Chris White</i>

23:23.369 --> 23:25.702
<i>in 1995 after he reported</i>

23:25.737 --> 23:27.704
<i>130 potential violations</i>

23:27.739 --> 23:29.139
<i>during his employment.</i>

23:29.174 --> 23:31.440
Do you see where the salt
has come up here

23:31.476 --> 23:33.609
on the edge
around this joint here?

23:33.645 --> 23:34.678
That's a leak.

23:34.713 --> 23:36.880
Most of the operators
in Osage County

23:36.915 --> 23:38.882
on the reservation,
they're good operators.

23:38.917 --> 23:42.451
There are some operators that,
when given the opportunity,

23:42.487 --> 23:45.621
they will take advantage of an
area like this, right here.

23:45.657 --> 23:47.723
It's money to them.
If they can cut corners,

23:47.758 --> 23:51.561
it reduces their overhead, so they're
dumping stuff on the ground,

23:51.596 --> 23:53.629
or not disposing of it properly,

23:53.665 --> 23:56.965
not maintaining their equipment
in a proper working order.

23:57.001 --> 23:58.001
<i>After being fired,</i>

23:58.035 --> 24:00.535
<i>Chris filed a complaint
against the council</i>

24:00.571 --> 24:02.071
<i>under the whistle-blower
provision</i>

24:02.106 --> 24:04.039
<i>within the Safe
Drinking Water Act.</i>

24:04.075 --> 24:06.241
<i>He won the case,
and it was discovered</i>

24:06.276 --> 24:09.544
<i>that the council's grounds
for firing him were unlawful.</i>

24:09.580 --> 24:13.148
<i>How does it make you feel to come
back here after all of that?</i>

24:13.184 --> 24:14.549
It's depressing.

24:14.585 --> 24:16.184
At some point in time,

24:16.220 --> 24:18.620
the chickens are gonna
come home to roost.

24:18.655 --> 24:21.756
<i>But spills are not
the only consequence</i>

24:21.791 --> 24:24.359
<i>of America's
shale oil revolution.</i>

24:24.394 --> 24:26.728
<i>We're in Cushing, Oklahoma.</i>

24:26.763 --> 24:30.732
People often refer to this
as the Saudi Arabia of the West,

24:30.767 --> 24:34.035
because there's more oil
flowing through and stored here

24:34.070 --> 24:36.003
than anywhere else
in North America.

24:36.039 --> 24:39.640
Cushing also happens to be
experiencing a rash of earthquakes.

24:39.675 --> 24:42.343
<i>Since 2008,
the state's gone</i>

24:42.378 --> 24:45.646
<i>from averaging
two a year to two a day.</i>

24:45.681 --> 24:46.913
A powerful earthquake

24:46.949 --> 24:48.716
rattled central
Oklahoma Saturday.

24:48.751 --> 24:51.084
<i>Oklahoma
geological survey experts</i>

24:51.120 --> 24:53.053
<i>have connected
the increase in quakes</i>

24:53.088 --> 24:57.157
<i>to the disposal of wastewater from
a oil and gas production process</i>

24:57.192 --> 24:59.860
<i>known as hydraulic fracturing,
or fracking.</i>

24:59.895 --> 25:01.295
<i>Jake Walter is</i>

25:01.330 --> 25:02.463
<i>the state seismologist</i>

25:02.498 --> 25:04.131
<i>for the Oklahoma
Geological Survey,</i>

25:04.166 --> 25:06.133
<i>and is studying the steady rise</i>

25:06.168 --> 25:08.601
<i>in seismic activity
over the last decade.</i>

25:08.637 --> 25:11.138
What's going on?
What's causing the earthquakes?

25:11.173 --> 25:15.208
There's thousands of injection
wells throughout Oklahoma.

25:15.244 --> 25:18.011
Oklahoma has loads
and loads of faults

25:18.046 --> 25:21.080
<i>in some of the deepest
sedimentary layers.</i>

25:21.115 --> 25:22.782
<i>Because of the high volumes</i>

25:22.817 --> 25:24.717
<i>of water that
have been injected,</i>

25:24.753 --> 25:27.520
<i>that water is working its way
into some of these faults,</i>

25:27.555 --> 25:29.789
<i>so that these faults
are allowed to slip.</i>

25:32.394 --> 25:34.093
<i>How does Oklahoma compare</i>

25:34.128 --> 25:37.229
to the rest of the country
in terms of seismic activity?

25:37.265 --> 25:39.031
Well, with the exception
of Alaska,

25:39.066 --> 25:43.202
Oklahoma is the most seismically
active state in the US.

25:43.237 --> 25:45.470
We're looking at a map
of Oklahoma here,

25:45.506 --> 25:47.273
and the earthquakes are in red,

25:47.308 --> 25:51.410
and the injection wells are
in those black squares there.

25:51.445 --> 25:53.978
You can see that injections
sort of spread

25:54.014 --> 25:55.980
to the north-central part
of Oklahoma,

25:56.016 --> 25:58.517
and the earthquakes
are not far behind.

25:58.552 --> 26:01.953
We're getting to a point where some of
these earthquakes are fairly significant--

26:01.988 --> 26:04.523
<i>the 5.8 that was
in September of this year,</i>

26:04.558 --> 26:06.157
<i>the 5.0 near Cushing,</i>

26:06.193 --> 26:10.094
<i>which is near a nationally
strategic oil pipeline.</i>

26:10.130 --> 26:13.164
These sort of last six years
have been unprecedented.

26:13.200 --> 26:16.201
How worried should people be
about these earthquakes?

26:16.236 --> 26:17.969
The hazard is very, very real.

26:18.004 --> 26:19.770
<i>But the threat</i>

26:19.806 --> 26:21.605
<i>of catastrophic damage
to infrastructure</i>

26:21.641 --> 26:25.210
<i>in Oklahoma has not stopped the
surge in shale oil production,</i>

26:25.245 --> 26:28.011
<i>which has skyrocketed
over thousand percent</i>

26:28.047 --> 26:29.680
<i>since the year 2000.</i>

26:29.716 --> 26:32.916
<i>With the support for a new
oil-friendly administration,</i>

26:32.952 --> 26:35.285
<i>the industry has 32,000 miles</i>

26:35.321 --> 26:36.954
<i>of new and planned pipelines</i>

26:36.989 --> 26:39.056
<i>in the works
across North America,</i>

26:39.091 --> 26:41.392
<i>according to</i> Pipeline
& Gas Journal.

26:41.427 --> 26:44.627
<i>And already, the Dakota Access
pipeline has leaked,</i>

26:44.663 --> 26:46.296
<i>confirming the fears
that brought it</i>

26:46.332 --> 26:49.066
<i>so much attention
in the first place.</i>

26:49.101 --> 26:53.003
<i>Luckily, the leaks
didn't impact drinking water,</i>

26:53.038 --> 26:56.206
<i>but Dave Archambault
showed us just how vulnerable</i>

26:56.242 --> 26:58.575
<i>the tribe could be if they had.</i>

26:58.610 --> 27:00.610
Would you say that this pipeline

27:00.645 --> 27:03.145
is now the biggest threat
to the community?

27:03.181 --> 27:04.848
Today it is.

27:04.883 --> 27:07.617
If you look right here, this
is where the water comes in.

27:07.652 --> 27:09.018
You can see the treatment plant,

27:09.053 --> 27:10.893
the intake, and the water
tower all right here.

27:10.922 --> 27:13.590
And that's the system that
provides the fresh drinking water,

27:13.625 --> 27:15.291
but it all comes
from Missouri River.

27:15.326 --> 27:18.995
<i>This pipeline that threatens
this water supply,</i>

27:19.030 --> 27:21.163
<i>carrying 550,000 barrels</i>

27:21.199 --> 27:24.000
<i>of crude oil with benzene in it,</i>

27:24.035 --> 27:26.468
<i>is gonna have a direct
impact on our people.</i>

27:26.504 --> 27:27.904
And that's not right.

27:28.873 --> 27:29.939
<i>Even though it's legal,</i>

27:29.974 --> 27:31.807
even though
the political system says,

27:31.842 --> 27:33.575
<i>"This is what we're gonna do,"</i>

27:33.611 --> 27:35.544
we can't continue
down this path,

27:35.579 --> 27:39.180
or we're gonna leave
nothing for our kids.

27:39.216 --> 27:43.051
<i> There are currently over 150
proposed oil and gas pipelines</i>

27:43.086 --> 27:44.787
<i>in the works across the country,</i>

27:44.822 --> 27:47.890
<i>many of which could potentially
cross through tribal lands.</i>

27:47.925 --> 27:50.892
<i>but the legacy of
Standing Rock has endured</i>

27:50.928 --> 27:53.327
<i>through numerous
pipeline protest movements</i>

27:53.362 --> 27:55.396
<i>that have sprung up
across North America.</i>

27:57.467 --> 28:00.301
<i>And pipeline divestment
groups have shepherded</i>

28:00.336 --> 28:01.803
<i>the removal of billions</i>

28:01.838 --> 28:03.504
<i>from the balance sheets
of investors.</i>

28:03.540 --> 28:04.872
Seattle is the first city

28:04.908 --> 28:06.674
to have divested
from Wells Fargo.

28:16.585 --> 28:20.587
Despite setbacks brought by
the Trump administration,

28:20.622 --> 28:22.856
these people aren't giving up.

28:24.860 --> 28:26.159
The fight for clean water

28:26.194 --> 28:27.594
is the battle for the soul

28:27.629 --> 28:29.863
of our nation
and of all nations.

28:32.100 --> 28:33.867
Our way of life
is being destroyed.

28:33.902 --> 28:35.902
Instead of expanding
human rights,

28:35.938 --> 28:38.304
the new administration
limits human rights.

28:39.641 --> 28:41.174
Repeat
after me, everybody!

28:41.209 --> 28:42.575
- I...
- I...

28:42.610 --> 28:44.210
...believe...
..believe...

28:44.245 --> 28:45.678
...that we...
..that we...

28:45.713 --> 28:47.480
...will win!
...will win!
