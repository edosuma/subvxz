01:58.869 --> 02:00.495
Miss Kelly, might I talk to you later?

02:01.038 --> 02:02.330
Not if what you're going to say

02:02.414 --> 02:05.708
will cause trouble for me
in some way or another.

02:13.217 --> 02:15.218
9:00 mass is over, girls.

02:21.642 --> 02:22.975
- Now.
- Thank you.

02:23.060 --> 02:24.227
- One moment, please.
- Excuse me.

02:24.311 --> 02:26.729
And some rashers
and some cheese.

02:30.025 --> 02:32.109
Mrs Brady,
what would you like this morning?

02:32.236 --> 02:34.904
- Half a dozen rashers, please.
- Of course.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.697
Eilis will get that for you now.

02:36.782 --> 02:38.699
- I was next.
- And you still are.

02:42.037 --> 02:43.955
- Yes?
- I need some shoe polish.

02:44.039 --> 02:48.125
Shoe polish?
That's not really a Sunday item, now, is it?

02:48.252 --> 02:50.670
These people need things
for their dinner or their tea.

02:50.754 --> 02:53.506
Why couldn't you have
remembered yesterday?

02:53.590 --> 02:56.175
Because it looks like
you needed it yesterday.

02:56.301 --> 02:57.593
I'm sorry.

03:10.691 --> 03:11.774
Miss Kelly...

03:12.276 --> 03:14.777
I hadn't forgotten.
Spit it out, whatever it is.

03:16.780 --> 03:18.614
I'm away to America.

03:21.493 --> 03:22.535
Whose idea was that?

03:23.287 --> 03:26.080
Father Flood in New York arranged it.

03:26.164 --> 03:29.000
Rose used to play golf with him.
He sponsored me.

03:29.126 --> 03:31.043
And he found me a job and got me a visa.

03:31.128 --> 03:32.728
Well, we won't be needing you back here.

03:32.796 --> 03:34.380
I could work every Sunday till I go.

03:34.464 --> 03:36.007
No, thank you.

03:38.719 --> 03:41.429
- Your poor sister.
- My sister?

03:41.513 --> 03:45.182
Well, mothers are always
being left behind in this country.

03:45.309 --> 03:47.059
But Rose,

03:47.144 --> 03:49.228
that's the end for her now, isn't it?

03:49.313 --> 03:52.648
She'll be looking after your mother
for the rest of her life.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.624
I wish I'd written to Father Flood
about you, Rose.

04:09.708 --> 04:11.918
Me? I have a job.

04:12.502 --> 04:15.504
You had a couple of hours on a Sunday
working for Nettles Kelly.

04:15.589 --> 04:16.714
You shouldn't call her that.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.175
I think it's quite a kind name.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.928
Considering she's actually
a terrible old witch.

04:22.012 --> 04:23.852
Well, I don't want to
talk about her any more.

04:24.348 --> 04:25.514
Good.

04:27.851 --> 04:30.451
They say it's hotter there in the summer
and colder in the winter.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.232
What in heaven's name
will she do about clothes?

04:35.359 --> 04:36.359
She'll buy them, Mother.

04:36.443 --> 04:38.653
She doesn't want to be
wasting her money on clothes.

04:38.737 --> 04:41.614
She won't have much choice.
She'll be there for...

04:56.588 --> 04:59.215
- You look beautiful, Nancy.
- Thank you.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.010
You look so beautiful.
It makes me despair of this place.

05:03.095 --> 05:04.428
Why?

05:04.554 --> 05:06.847
Well, you're the prettiest girl
in County Wexford.

05:06.932 --> 05:08.975
You should be able to choose
any man you want

05:09.059 --> 05:12.395
and we're hoping that George Sheridan
from the rugby club looks your way.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.188
Do you think he might?

05:14.272 --> 05:16.023
Of course he will.

05:16.108 --> 05:20.277
I know you like him, Nancy,
but he's not Gary Cooper, is he?

05:20.404 --> 05:23.239
And those boys with their hair oil
and their blazers.

05:23.407 --> 05:25.408
- He has beautiful eyes.
- Mmm...

05:25.492 --> 05:29.453
And he's going to come into
a beautiful shop in the market square.

05:31.415 --> 05:33.791
Why didn't you wear your blue dress?

05:33.917 --> 05:36.585
Are you asking why I didn't
make more of an effort?

05:37.504 --> 05:39.463
I suppose cos I'm going away.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.507
Mind, now.

05:42.259 --> 05:43.968
Come on.

06:13.123 --> 06:14.790
He's looked over here twice already.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.000
He hasn't!

06:18.378 --> 06:20.713
- He's walking over here now.
- He's not!

06:21.173 --> 06:24.175
Why would I keep lying to you
about what George Sheridan's doing?

06:26.678 --> 06:29.305
Would you like to dance?

07:19.272 --> 07:21.190
Is that really everything you own?

07:21.691 --> 07:23.025
Oh, Eilis.

07:23.693 --> 07:25.213
I should have looked after you better.

07:25.904 --> 07:28.906
You've bought most of the
clothes in this case.

07:29.866 --> 07:32.576
That's one of the reasons I'm going,
cos I can't buy my own.

07:32.661 --> 07:35.996
If it was just that,
I'd spend every penny I had on you.

07:36.081 --> 07:37.581
Gladly.

07:38.416 --> 07:40.417
But I can't buy you a future.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.587
I can't buy you the kind of life you need.

07:43.672 --> 07:45.089
I know.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.635
But you'll come see me there one day?

07:49.719 --> 07:50.845
Yes.

07:52.806 --> 07:55.057
And you'll look after yourself?

07:55.225 --> 07:56.976
You don't have to worry about me.

07:57.060 --> 07:59.436
And I'll come home to visit, won't I?

08:00.814 --> 08:02.523
Cos I couldn't bear it if...

08:03.066 --> 08:05.317
You haven't packed your shoes yet.

08:05.861 --> 08:07.862
They'll take up a bit of room.

08:15.453 --> 08:16.745
There.

10:02.560 --> 10:03.602
Oh!

10:03.770 --> 10:05.145
I'm sorry.

10:16.825 --> 10:18.409
Off.

10:18.493 --> 10:20.828
Number one, bottom bunk, that's mine.

10:20.912 --> 10:22.454
You're on the top.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.005
This is hell.

10:31.256 --> 10:33.716
- Never again.
- Never again to America?

10:33.800 --> 10:37.219
The mistake was coming home
from America in the first place.

10:38.221 --> 10:40.848
I'd do anything to get out
of this horrible cabin.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.808
Let's go for a smoke.

10:42.892 --> 10:44.184
I don't.

10:44.853 --> 10:47.187
Suit yourself. I'll see you later.

10:47.272 --> 10:50.024
Unless I find a nice man
in First to smoke with.

11:08.585 --> 11:12.713
It's good to see that not everybody's put
off their dinner by the weather forecast.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.840
It's supposed to be a rough one tonight,

11:14.924 --> 11:16.884
so none of the other passengers are eating.

11:16.968 --> 11:20.679
A few spoonfuls of soup maybe,
but not the mutton stew.

11:32.359 --> 11:33.734
Please unlock it.

12:03.765 --> 12:05.766
Go away!

12:18.905 --> 12:20.489
I'm sorry about the smell.

12:21.282 --> 12:22.866
And the bucket.

12:22.951 --> 12:25.119
Don't worry. The whole boat stinks.

12:25.412 --> 12:28.789
Even First Class. I've just been
thrown out of there, by the way.

12:28.873 --> 12:31.041
The bathroom door was locked all night.

12:32.210 --> 12:33.961
Oh, those bastards.

13:03.658 --> 13:06.285
There. Won't be very comfortable,
but at least it's ours.

13:07.579 --> 13:09.246
- Open the door.
- Feck off.

13:09.330 --> 13:11.331
- Open the door right now.
- Do you hear me? Fuck off.

13:11.416 --> 13:13.917
If you'd been nice last night,
we would have played fair.

13:14.002 --> 13:15.502
- Now you've got no toilet.
- Get out of the bathroom.

13:15.587 --> 13:16.837
You bastards.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.298
Go on, you can use it.

13:19.382 --> 13:22.050
I'm going to get us some water.
That's all you're allowed.

13:28.892 --> 13:31.226
Are you going to live in America?

13:31.311 --> 13:32.686
Yes.

13:32.770 --> 13:34.521
You have papers and everything?

13:34.606 --> 13:36.523
Yes. And a job.

13:36.608 --> 13:38.650
How'd you manage to arrange all that?

13:39.068 --> 13:42.321
I didn't. Someone did it for me.
A priest my sister knows.

13:42.697 --> 13:44.490
And how do you feel about it?

13:49.913 --> 13:52.372
How long do letters from Ireland
take to arrive?

13:52.457 --> 13:54.257
My sister Rose said she'd
write straightaway.

13:54.292 --> 13:56.877
They take a long time at first.

13:57.462 --> 13:58.879
And then no time at all.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.840
You have family in America? Friends?

14:01.925 --> 14:03.008
No.

14:03.218 --> 14:05.093
You'll meet people easily enough.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.054
Where are you gonna live? Brooklyn?

14:08.223 --> 14:10.182
- How'd you know that?
- Lucky guess.

14:11.100 --> 14:14.811
Try to remember that sometimes it's nice to
talk to people who don't know your auntie.

14:15.522 --> 14:16.647
That's what it's like?

14:17.273 --> 14:18.690
That's what it's like.

14:25.114 --> 14:27.074
I haven't been sick for hours.

14:27.158 --> 14:28.742
Nice, isn't it?

14:29.661 --> 14:30.994
I'm very hungry.

14:31.079 --> 14:33.622
That's why you haven't been sick for hours.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.499
We'll eat tomorrow.

14:36.209 --> 14:37.918
Or the day after.

14:43.341 --> 14:46.760
Oh, dear. We're gonna have
to do something with you.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.387
They'll put you in quarantine or something

14:48.471 --> 14:50.889
if you try and enter the country
looking like that.

14:52.016 --> 14:54.685
Nothing fancy.
You mustn't look like a tart.

14:55.645 --> 14:58.939
Oh, well, looking like a tart
isn't going to be a problem.

15:00.608 --> 15:02.317
This doesn't look too bad.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.403
My sister gave me that.

15:06.948 --> 15:09.533
Wear it with this

15:09.701 --> 15:11.118
and...

15:13.204 --> 15:14.621
...this.

15:18.793 --> 15:20.669
Have your bags ready for inspection.

15:20.753 --> 15:23.088
Don't look too innocent, though.

15:24.048 --> 15:26.633
I'll put some rouge and mascara on you.

15:28.177 --> 15:30.053
Perhaps a little eye liner.

15:41.816 --> 15:45.110
Step out of the line, please.
Thank you. Next, please. Thank you.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.488
Step over this way, please.
Get out of the line.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.240
Next. Passport, please.

15:50.325 --> 15:51.783
Stand up straight.

15:51.909 --> 15:53.660
Polish your shoes.

15:53.786 --> 15:56.330
And don't cough, whatever you do.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.123
Over this way.

15:59.167 --> 16:02.919
Don't be rude or pushy,
but don't look too nervous.

16:03.504 --> 16:05.380
Step this way.

16:05.715 --> 16:07.382
Think like an American.

16:09.010 --> 16:10.802
You have to know where you're going.

16:10.887 --> 16:13.055
Welcome to the United States, ma'am.

16:13.139 --> 16:15.140
Through the blue door, please.

16:15.266 --> 16:16.892
Next, please.

16:59.519 --> 17:00.644
Bless us, oh Lord,

17:00.728 --> 17:03.355
and these thy gifts which we are
about to receive from thy bounty

17:03.439 --> 17:04.522
through Christ our Lord, amen.

17:04.607 --> 17:06.108
Amen.

17:10.655 --> 17:13.198
I saw you had a letter today, Diana.
Any news?

17:13.281 --> 17:16.535
Mr de Valera's had another operation on
his eyes, she says. He's been in Holland.

17:16.618 --> 17:18.912
I don't want news I can
read in a newspaper.

17:18.996 --> 17:21.205
Anyway, we would describe
Mr de Valera as politics,

17:21.290 --> 17:22.332
would we not, Mrs Kehoe?

17:22.458 --> 17:24.459
And we do not like politics
at the dinner table.

17:24.544 --> 17:25.585
We don't.

17:25.670 --> 17:27.295
It's not politics to talk
about eye operations.

17:27.505 --> 17:29.423
It is if the eyes belong to a politician.

17:30.258 --> 17:32.592
And I don't like to talk about
hospitals very much either.

17:33.344 --> 17:35.011
Patty, did you have any luck
with that cold cream?

17:35.096 --> 17:36.763
No, Mrs Kehoe.
I asked Miss Tyler in Cosmetics.

17:36.848 --> 17:38.098
And I showed her the advertisement.

17:38.182 --> 17:40.225
I don't want to have to travel
all the way into Manhattan

17:40.309 --> 17:41.810
just for a jar of cold cream.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.229
Maybe you could have a look
in Bartocci's for me, Eilis?

17:44.313 --> 17:45.397
Yes, Mrs Kehoe.

17:45.481 --> 17:46.773
Oh, Bartocci's is bound to have it.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.775
She doesn't know that for sure, Mrs Kehoe.

17:48.860 --> 17:51.611
She's only saying that Bartocci's
is a better store than Webster's

17:51.696 --> 17:52.738
to get at Patty.

17:52.822 --> 17:53.905
They're both very good

17:53.990 --> 17:57.159
and you girls are very lucky
to be working there.

17:57.243 --> 18:00.120
Eilis, from the look of you,
you have greasy skin.

18:00.621 --> 18:03.081
Is that right? What do you do about that?

18:05.042 --> 18:09.379
Just... Well, I wash it,
Mrs Kehoe, with soap.

18:09.464 --> 18:10.922
There's nothing wrong with soap.

18:11.007 --> 18:13.133
Soap was good enough for Our Lord,
I expect.

18:13.217 --> 18:15.802
Oh, and which brand did he use,
Miss McAdam?

18:16.012 --> 18:17.220
Does the Bible tell you that?

18:17.346 --> 18:19.347
Our Lord was a man, anyway.

18:19.474 --> 18:20.599
He didn't care about greasy skin.

18:20.683 --> 18:22.601
Ladies, no more talk about

18:22.685 --> 18:25.187
Our Lord's complexion at dinner, please.

18:25.313 --> 18:27.022
The girls will help you find
something suitable, Eilis.

18:27.148 --> 18:29.316
- Won't you, girls?
- Mmm-hmm.

19:00.598 --> 19:01.723
Hi.

19:02.225 --> 19:05.060
- Good morning.
- Did you go out last night?

19:06.270 --> 19:08.855
- Out, the opposite of in.
- No.

19:09.398 --> 19:12.234
Well, I saw a movie with my boyfriend.

19:14.070 --> 19:16.029
"What did you see, Dorothy?"

19:16.364 --> 19:19.241
"I saw The Quiet Man, Eilis.
They filmed it in Ireland."

19:19.367 --> 19:20.951
"Oh, I'm from Ireland."

19:21.077 --> 19:24.579
"I know you are. That's why I thought
you might be interested."

19:26.415 --> 19:27.791
Thank you.

19:45.226 --> 19:46.810
Shouldn't be a moment.

20:00.449 --> 20:02.117
Is it still hot out there?

20:02.243 --> 20:03.702
I haven't been outside since this morning.

20:03.786 --> 20:06.955
But I can tell that it might be very.

20:07.623 --> 20:10.166
It just looks it.

20:11.002 --> 20:12.294
It's warm, yes.

20:22.179 --> 20:23.346
Thanks very much.

20:27.518 --> 20:29.811
Remember, if people like it here,
they'll come back,

20:29.937 --> 20:32.981
so you treat every customer
as if she's a new friend.

20:33.107 --> 20:34.774
- I'll try.
- It's not a matter of trying.

20:34.859 --> 20:36.568
It's what you have to do.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.132
Do you try to wear panties every day?

20:39.614 --> 20:40.947
No.

20:41.032 --> 20:43.491
I mean, I don't... I don't try.
I just put them on.

20:44.118 --> 20:46.161
You see what I'm saying?

20:46.495 --> 20:47.537
Yes.

20:47.663 --> 20:48.830
Good.

20:53.961 --> 20:56.338
Can we get
another side of toast, please?

20:56.464 --> 20:57.672
Slice up some hot dogs.

20:57.798 --> 20:59.841
They want 'em sliced down the middle.

21:05.056 --> 21:07.349
Sorry. Could I have the bill, please?

21:13.481 --> 21:15.357
I hope that when I go through
the Pearly Gates,

21:15.483 --> 21:17.984
the first sound I hear is you
asking me for the cheque

21:18.069 --> 21:20.070
in that lovely Irish brogue.

21:36.837 --> 21:38.171
Diana?

22:14.709 --> 22:17.377
Have they told you a date
for the nylon sale yet, Eilis?

22:17.461 --> 22:19.295
Never had a Bartocci's girl living here.

22:20.423 --> 22:21.881
Might get some inside information.

22:22.258 --> 22:23.800
I haven't been told anything.

22:23.926 --> 22:26.094
- I bet you wouldn't let on if you had.
- She's that sort.

22:26.220 --> 22:27.762
More loyal to her bosses
than to her friends.

22:27.888 --> 22:30.098
- Like a Red spy.
- Oh, dear God.

22:31.308 --> 22:34.728
I'll thank you to keep His name
out of a conversation about nylons.

22:35.438 --> 22:38.565
He might be everywhere, but he's certainly
not in Bartocci's on sale day.

22:38.649 --> 22:40.108
Sorry, Mrs Kehoe.

22:40.234 --> 22:42.995
I was glad to see you finally got
some letters from home today, Eilis.

22:43.320 --> 22:45.030
Did I? I forgot to check.

22:45.114 --> 22:47.782
They'll still be there after dinner.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.075
Sorry.

23:02.965 --> 23:04.424
Dear Eilis.

23:04.508 --> 23:07.802
It's hard for me to believe
that you're reading this in America,

23:07.928 --> 23:10.180
thousands of miles across the sea.

23:11.307 --> 23:13.850
The big news here is that since you left,

23:13.976 --> 23:16.519
Mammy has stopped shopping
at Nettles Kelly's.

23:16.645 --> 23:19.481
As you know, her bread wasn't always fresh

23:19.607 --> 23:21.649
and she overcharged for everything...

23:21.776 --> 23:23.109
And she's awful.

23:23.194 --> 23:25.487
I haven't told her to her face.

23:25.613 --> 23:26.821
There's no need.

23:26.947 --> 23:30.200
She knows that she overcharges
and her bread's not fresh.

23:31.535 --> 23:34.454
We talk about you every evening,
of course.

23:34.997 --> 23:37.373
We want to know everything.

23:37.500 --> 23:39.209
I'm sure you're busy,

23:39.627 --> 23:45.006
but even if your letters were 200 pages,
they wouldn't be long enough for your mother.

23:50.888 --> 23:53.515
Take care of yourself. Love.

24:08.197 --> 24:09.989
Is it your time of the month?

24:10.825 --> 24:12.367
So what is it?

24:16.539 --> 24:19.749
Take some time off now.
Go and sit in the staff room.

24:28.092 --> 24:31.427
I'm so sorry, Eilis. This is all my fault.

24:31.554 --> 24:35.014
I was led to believe
that you didn't need looking after.

24:35.099 --> 24:37.016
Franco Bartocci says
you're doing great here.

24:37.101 --> 24:39.894
Ma Kehoe says you're
the nicest lodger she's ever had.

24:40.729 --> 24:42.438
- What?
- "Ma Kehoe"?

24:42.898 --> 24:44.378
Don't ever call her that to her face.

24:45.734 --> 24:49.028
I'd forgotten just how bad it feels
to be away from home.

24:49.947 --> 24:54.742
I've enrolled you in a night class,
for book-keeping. Brooklyn College.

24:54.910 --> 24:58.413
It'll be three nights a week and
I've paid your tuition for the first semester.

24:59.248 --> 25:02.876
- Why?
- Why? Not thank you?

25:03.127 --> 25:06.671
Sorry. Thank you. But why?

25:06.755 --> 25:08.506
Well, I was amazed
that someone as clever as you

25:08.591 --> 25:10.925
couldn't find proper work at home.

25:11.760 --> 25:13.636
I've been here too long.

25:13.762 --> 25:15.763
I forget what it's like in Ireland.

25:16.807 --> 25:18.892
So when your sister wrote to me about you,

25:18.976 --> 25:21.227
I said the Church would try to help.

25:22.313 --> 25:24.772
Anyway, we need Irish girls in Brooklyn.

25:25.441 --> 25:29.277
I wish that I could stop feeling
that I want to be an Irish girl in Ireland.

25:29.403 --> 25:32.155
All I can say is that it will pass.

25:32.990 --> 25:35.700
Homesickness is like most sicknesses.

25:35.784 --> 25:40.163
It'll make you feel wretched
and then it'll move on to somebody else.

25:42.625 --> 25:46.753
Now, Taylor v. Standard Gas Company is one
of the most important corporate cases

25:46.837 --> 25:49.714
decided in the Supreme Court
in the last 20 years.

25:49.798 --> 25:53.259
This was the case responsible
for the Deep Rock Doctrine,

25:53.344 --> 25:57.305
so it's maybe the biggest milestone
in parent-subsidiary law.

25:57.640 --> 26:01.809
In public utility integration
proceedings alone,

26:02.144 --> 26:06.606
literally thousands of investors
may be affected by its application.

26:10.945 --> 26:13.488
Did you understand any of that?

26:13.614 --> 26:15.156
I mean, a single word?

26:17.660 --> 26:19.244
He's not even reading from a book.

26:19.328 --> 26:20.453
He just knows all this.

26:21.622 --> 26:24.457
Well, let's hope the
next hour's easier, huh?

26:36.887 --> 26:40.807
One of the things that ruins
Christmas in America is the turkey.

26:40.891 --> 26:42.642
It all tastes of sawdust.

26:42.726 --> 26:44.602
So that's one cheese sandwich
for Miss McAdam

26:44.687 --> 26:46.104
and extra turkey for everyone else.

26:47.356 --> 26:48.564
Ladies, please.

26:50.859 --> 26:53.736
Eilis, Father Flood told me
about your Christmas plans.

26:53.862 --> 26:56.948
Oh, you're not serving lunch to the old fellas
who've nowhere to go, are you?

26:57.032 --> 26:59.158
He asks us every year. We always say no.

26:59.243 --> 27:01.369
Eilis, you're a saint. They smell awful.

27:01.495 --> 27:04.415
Sheila knows how they smell because
that's where she goes husband hunting.

27:07.543 --> 27:10.920
It's a marvellous thing you're doing, Eilis.
A Christian thing.

27:11.046 --> 27:12.880
I wish there were more like you.

27:15.884 --> 27:17.677
In you come.

27:18.721 --> 27:20.096
How many are we expecting?

27:20.222 --> 27:22.473
We had a hundred last year.
There may be more this.

27:22.558 --> 27:25.560
- Are they all Irish?
- All Irish.

27:26.562 --> 27:28.354
Why don't they go home?

27:29.231 --> 27:31.791
If there's nothing there
for clever young girls such as yourself,

27:31.859 --> 27:34.193
there's gonna be even
less for men like these.

27:34.278 --> 27:37.071
Some of them have been here 50 years.

27:37.197 --> 27:38.698
They've lost touch with everyone.

27:38.782 --> 27:40.491
Lovely. Thank you.

27:40.576 --> 27:42.285
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

27:42.578 --> 27:44.746
These are the men who built the tunnels,

27:44.872 --> 27:47.874
the bridges, the highways.

27:47.958 --> 27:50.460
God alone knows what they live on now.

28:05.768 --> 28:06.934
Anyway...

28:11.940 --> 28:14.150
I don't want to interrupt proceedings,

28:14.276 --> 28:17.445
but I'm sure you'd all like
to show your appreciation

28:17.571 --> 28:20.073
to all the ladies here for
their hard day's work.

28:20.157 --> 28:21.491
And by way of a thank you,

28:21.617 --> 28:24.035
we have a great singer
in the room with us today.

28:24.119 --> 28:26.120
Frankie.

29:54.042 --> 29:55.585
Mind yourself, there.

30:31.413 --> 30:34.457
Would you like to come into the front room
for a glass of something?

30:34.583 --> 30:35.625
You've earned it.

30:37.711 --> 30:39.253
You survived.

30:39.880 --> 30:41.005
Ah...

30:41.089 --> 30:43.382
It wasn't so bad.

30:45.594 --> 30:47.637
- Happy Christmas.
- Cheers.

30:52.935 --> 30:55.186
Now, Miss McAdam is leaving us.

30:55.270 --> 30:57.355
She's going to live
with her sister in Manhattan.

30:57.439 --> 30:59.482
She has the best room in the house,

30:59.608 --> 31:00.900
the basement,

31:01.485 --> 31:04.320
and it has its own entrance.

31:04.446 --> 31:06.322
Now, I can only let

31:06.448 --> 31:09.951
a certain kind of girl stay there.

31:10.452 --> 31:11.911
Oh, and I'm not talking about looks here.

31:11.995 --> 31:14.580
Although I will admit, God did give
Miss McAdam an advantage

31:14.665 --> 31:16.958
when I had to think about
who I could trust to live down there.

31:17.084 --> 31:18.960
No, no, you're a pretty girl, Eilis,

31:19.086 --> 31:21.128
but you're sensible.

31:21.672 --> 31:24.048
So, you're having the room and that's that.

31:24.132 --> 31:25.550
Will the other girls not mind?

31:25.634 --> 31:27.593
Oh, I expect so.

31:27.678 --> 31:29.637
What don't they mind?

31:34.977 --> 31:37.853
Girls, you'll take Dolores to the dance
with you on Saturday night, won't you?

31:37.980 --> 31:38.980
There's a dance?

31:39.106 --> 31:40.648
At the parish hall.

31:40.774 --> 31:43.651
There'll be no alcohol,
but you can have fun without it.

31:44.152 --> 31:47.196
Um... Patty and I aren't going this week.

31:48.156 --> 31:50.116
We're going to see a movie instead.

31:50.200 --> 31:52.660
Well, I'm sure Dolores would
enjoy a movie just as well.

31:52.786 --> 31:54.245
I would, very much.

31:54.329 --> 31:57.331
There are so many more movies
here in New York than in Cavan.

31:57.457 --> 31:58.541
Yes, surprising, isn't it?

31:58.667 --> 32:00.267
You'd think it'd be the other way round.

32:04.172 --> 32:06.924
Of course, you would be welcome
to join us, Dolores.

32:07.009 --> 32:09.176
So long as you don't
mind being a gooseberry.

32:09.303 --> 32:13.848
So you both miraculously found boyfriends
over the last couple of days, did you?

32:14.349 --> 32:18.019
Well, I hope you have more luck
with these than you did with the last few.

32:18.145 --> 32:20.479
- Will you be going, Eilis?
- Yes, Mrs Kehoe.

32:20.564 --> 32:23.566
Well, you can take Dolores, then.
Of course.

32:45.672 --> 32:48.090
God. There's nobody here.

32:49.343 --> 32:52.637
How are we supposed to get a fella
if there's nobody here?

32:52.721 --> 32:55.097
I expect most people will come after 9:00.

32:55.223 --> 32:57.350
People or fellas?

32:58.393 --> 33:00.561
Some of the people will be fellas.

33:01.396 --> 33:03.064
I'd love to meet a fella.

33:05.901 --> 33:08.861
They came. The liars.

33:08.945 --> 33:11.364
What a pair of bitches.

33:12.074 --> 33:14.116
That's what the old woman called them.

33:14.242 --> 33:16.410
She said they were all bitches.

33:17.913 --> 33:19.914
Apart from you.

33:29.966 --> 33:31.676
Well, hello.

33:31.760 --> 33:33.427
Hello. It's good to see you.

33:33.553 --> 33:34.929
I can see why.

33:36.139 --> 33:38.307
Come with us.

33:52.823 --> 33:55.199
There. That's better.

33:55.283 --> 33:58.160
Now you don't look like you came in
from milking the cows.

33:58.286 --> 34:00.788
- Is that what I looked like?
- Just a bit.

34:01.498 --> 34:03.541
Nice, clean cows.

34:03.625 --> 34:06.168
One, two, three.

34:06.294 --> 34:08.170
Two, two, three.

34:10.257 --> 34:11.674
Not bad.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.634
Two...

34:22.476 --> 34:23.811
Maybe we can have a dance later.

34:23.937 --> 34:24.978
I'm sorry?

34:25.105 --> 34:27.815
- A dance, later.
- Oh. Sure.

34:28.692 --> 34:30.775
Would you like to dance?

34:42.831 --> 34:46.375
Are you here with that guy,
the one who was teaching you to dance?

34:46.501 --> 34:49.335
- No.
- So would you dance with me?

34:49.838 --> 34:51.422
I'm not sure he taught me anything.

34:51.505 --> 34:52.757
Doesn't matter.

34:52.841 --> 34:55.009
Secret is to look as though
you know what you're doing.

34:55.969 --> 34:58.012
I wish someone had told me that years ago.

34:59.806 --> 35:01.557
Come on.

35:34.007 --> 35:35.716
Where do you live?

35:37.219 --> 35:39.428
- Clinton Street.
- Yeah?

35:40.555 --> 35:42.556
That's on my way home.

35:43.683 --> 35:45.518
Can I walk you?

35:46.394 --> 35:49.313
I'm going to say yes
and then I'm going to tell you why.

35:49.397 --> 35:51.232
So I don't get the wrong idea?

35:51.358 --> 35:53.192
I suppose so.

35:53.568 --> 35:57.696
Is there a girl in a white shirt
sitting on her own over there?

36:02.244 --> 36:04.745
- You don't know her?
- I do.

36:05.956 --> 36:08.749
She lives in my boarding house
and she's awful.

36:08.875 --> 36:11.335
If I leave with you,
I'm sure she'd understand.

36:11.419 --> 36:14.088
- You'd be rescuing me.
- I get it.

36:35.610 --> 36:37.111
I'm not Irish.

36:38.280 --> 36:40.155
You don't sound Irish.

36:41.074 --> 36:43.075
I need to make this clear.

36:43.159 --> 36:45.452
No part of me is Irish.

36:45.579 --> 36:49.415
I don't have Irish parents
or grandparents or anything.

36:49.499 --> 36:52.501
I'm Italian. Well, my parents are, anyway.

36:52.627 --> 36:54.628
So what were you doing at an Irish dance?

36:54.754 --> 36:56.714
Don't the Italians have dances?

36:56.798 --> 36:59.133
Yeah, and I wouldn't wanna take you to one.

36:59.259 --> 37:01.343
They behave like Italians all night.

37:01.469 --> 37:03.804
- What does that mean?
- Oh, you know.

37:03.930 --> 37:05.306
No.

37:06.099 --> 37:07.433
Hands.

37:07.517 --> 37:08.767
Too many of them?

37:08.852 --> 37:12.813
I guess it could seem that way
if you was a girl. Listen...

37:16.192 --> 37:18.193
I want everything out in the open.

37:18.320 --> 37:21.280
I came to the Irish dance...

37:22.699 --> 37:25.284
because I really like Irish girls.

37:25.994 --> 37:28.078
And I was the only one
who would dance with you?

37:28.163 --> 37:29.538
Oh, no, it wasn't...

37:29.664 --> 37:32.291
Oh, so you danced with loads of others?

37:41.343 --> 37:43.135
This is me.

37:45.680 --> 37:47.723
Can I take you next week,

37:47.849 --> 37:50.017
maybe get something to eat first?

37:51.853 --> 37:53.687
That'd be nice.

37:55.148 --> 37:56.649
Good night.

38:15.543 --> 38:17.002
So...

38:19.214 --> 38:21.715
What do you do when you're not working?

38:22.926 --> 38:25.260
Well, there's school.

38:25.553 --> 38:28.263
Just, you know, Brooklyn College.

38:28.390 --> 38:30.057
I'm studying book-keeping.

38:30.183 --> 38:32.142
You wanna be a book-keeper?

38:32.227 --> 38:36.438
Well, I want to be an accountant one day,
but, yes, book-keeping first.

38:36.564 --> 38:38.565
- Wow.
- Mmm.

38:39.067 --> 38:41.151
Is that difficult?

38:41.236 --> 38:43.862
I'm talking too much.
Tell me about plumbing.

38:43.947 --> 38:46.073
You know enough about plumbing already.

38:46.199 --> 38:48.075
I don't know anything.

38:48.702 --> 38:52.371
You know that taps drip
and that toilets get blocked

38:52.455 --> 38:54.039
and that's all you need to know.

38:54.124 --> 38:56.083
I mean, I don't know anything
about book-keeping.

39:00.922 --> 39:02.715
Well, there's a lot to it.

39:02.799 --> 39:05.926
There's all the maths, of course,
but that's not so complicated.

39:06.052 --> 39:08.554
The double-entry system,
that takes a while to get used to.

39:08.638 --> 39:11.849
And we study company law too
and that terrifies me.

39:11.933 --> 39:13.934
So we had to read about
an insurance company

39:14.060 --> 39:15.936
that went bankrupt in the 1930s

39:16.062 --> 39:18.063
and all the legal issues
that went along with that.

39:18.148 --> 39:20.649
She plays golf and she's really good at it

39:20.775 --> 39:22.359
and if she'd been at the
dance last Saturday,

39:22.444 --> 39:24.653
then I don't think
you'd have looked at me twice

39:24.779 --> 39:26.905
because Rose is beautiful.

39:29.117 --> 39:31.702
I'm worried. You haven't eaten anything.

39:31.786 --> 39:32.995
Oh.

39:33.121 --> 39:34.997
Too busy talking.

39:43.006 --> 39:44.840
What is the matter with you girls now?

39:44.966 --> 39:47.634
Nothing is the matter with us, Mrs Kehoe.

39:47.761 --> 39:49.887
Is this all because Eilis
has found herself a young man?

39:49.971 --> 39:51.472
Eilis has a young man?

39:51.681 --> 39:52.848
We didn't know.

39:52.974 --> 39:54.767
She won't say anything about it.

39:54.851 --> 39:57.519
And why should she
to you awful gossipmongers?

39:59.105 --> 40:02.524
Anyway, I met him on Saturday night
when he called for Eilis,

40:02.650 --> 40:03.776
and he's a gentleman.

40:03.860 --> 40:06.195
Will you tell us what you know
about him, Mrs Kehoe?

40:06.321 --> 40:07.654
We know he's quite nice-looking.

40:07.781 --> 40:09.990
Didn't like his shoes much.

40:10.325 --> 40:12.284
What on Earth is wrong with his shoes?

40:12.368 --> 40:14.369
They were a funny colour.

40:14.829 --> 40:16.080
I'll tell you this much.

40:16.164 --> 40:17.664
I'm going to ask Father Flood

40:17.791 --> 40:20.459
to preach a sermon
on the dangers of giddiness.

40:20.543 --> 40:23.629
I see now that giddiness
is the eighth deadly sin.

40:23.713 --> 40:28.383
A giddy girl is every bit as evil
as a slothful man,

40:28.510 --> 40:30.719
and the noise she makes is a lot worse.

40:30.845 --> 40:32.513
Now, enough.

40:56.162 --> 40:58.413
All I wanna do is travel home with you.

40:58.540 --> 41:00.707
No food, no drink, no nothing.

41:00.834 --> 41:03.544
I know you gotta study and get some sleep.

41:03.670 --> 41:06.380
I'll take you to your
house and say good night.

41:06.506 --> 41:10.884
Otherwise, it's too long to wait.

41:17.559 --> 41:20.602
I wanna ask you something
and you're gonna say,

41:20.728 --> 41:23.772
"Oh, it's too soon.
I don't really know him well enough.

41:23.898 --> 41:25.065
"We only been out a couple of times."

41:25.191 --> 41:26.483
Oh, it's nothing so bad.

41:26.568 --> 41:28.110
It's just something that most guys, they...

41:28.236 --> 41:29.611
Please just ask.

41:29.737 --> 41:30.904
You're beginning to terrify me.

41:30.989 --> 41:32.072
Oh...

41:33.241 --> 41:37.411
Sure. Will you come for dinner
and meet my family sometime?

41:39.080 --> 41:40.414
That's it?

41:41.082 --> 41:42.249
I'd love to.

41:45.253 --> 41:46.420
You like Italian food?

41:46.754 --> 41:48.547
Don't know. I've never eaten it.

41:48.631 --> 41:50.257
It's the best food in the world.

41:50.341 --> 41:52.342
Well, why would I not like it?

41:53.761 --> 41:55.971
You're in a good mood, huh?

41:56.097 --> 41:57.973
Yes. Why?

41:58.099 --> 42:01.810
It's just... I like how you're being.

42:03.271 --> 42:06.440
I don't know the word,
when you go along with everything.

42:07.775 --> 42:10.360
- Amenable.
- Yeah? Amenable?

42:11.446 --> 42:14.239
OK, so while you're being amenable,

42:14.324 --> 42:17.618
can we go see a movie this week
when you're not in night class?

42:20.622 --> 42:22.497
I'll sign up for two movies.

42:22.624 --> 42:24.791
- Really?
- Yes.

42:25.126 --> 42:28.503
Even if the first date is a disaster,
I'll give it another chance.

42:35.970 --> 42:38.472
Parkway's next stop.

42:38.556 --> 42:40.015
Parkway's next.

42:41.851 --> 42:43.143
It certainly feels like it,

42:43.228 --> 42:45.437
but this is my first year,
so I don't know how to judge.

42:45.521 --> 42:46.688
Well, congratulations.

42:46.814 --> 42:48.398
You've survived your first New York winter.

42:48.483 --> 42:49.691
Ah. Wasn't so bad.

42:49.817 --> 42:51.235
Really? It's colder in Ireland?

42:51.319 --> 42:52.694
Oh, no, it's colder here.

42:53.905 --> 42:54.947
Over here that's how

42:55.031 --> 42:56.448
we judge the winter, on how cold it is.

42:56.532 --> 42:58.784
But you have heating, heating everywhere.

42:58.868 --> 43:00.410
You're only cold outside.

43:00.495 --> 43:02.329
I guess that's true.

43:03.331 --> 43:05.832
- Thank you for your help.
- Have a good day.

43:09.420 --> 43:10.879
Eilis.

43:11.005 --> 43:13.882
You're like a different person.
How did you do it?

43:14.008 --> 43:17.219
Maybe I can pass some advice on
to the next poor girl who feels that way.

43:17.345 --> 43:19.721
I met somebody. An Italian fella.

43:19.847 --> 43:22.099
Oh, no. I'm not passing that on.

43:22.183 --> 43:24.268
I'd rather have them homesick
than heartbroken.

43:25.270 --> 43:26.910
Does he talk about baseball all the time?

43:27.021 --> 43:28.522
- Or his mother?
- No.

43:28.606 --> 43:30.232
Then keep him.

43:30.358 --> 43:32.438
There isn't another Italian man
like him in New York.

43:36.572 --> 43:38.198
Hold it.

43:38.616 --> 43:41.368
Now, remember you're getting off easy
because we haven't got sauce.

43:41.452 --> 43:44.496
Yeah, you have to remember
that the sauce flies everywhere,

43:44.580 --> 43:46.373
so take it slowly.

43:46.791 --> 43:49.334
I'm gonna say "splash"
any time I see problems.

43:49.419 --> 43:51.962
- Good idea.
- Can I start now?

43:52.046 --> 43:53.463
- Yeah.
- Go.

44:07.812 --> 44:10.063
Splash!

44:10.440 --> 44:13.650
You just splashed his mother,
his father, and the walls.

44:14.319 --> 44:15.652
Let's go again.

44:17.447 --> 44:18.739
Dear Rose.

44:18.823 --> 44:22.909
I suppose the most important news
is that I have a boyfriend.

44:23.411 --> 44:27.080
He isn't as important as Bartocci's
and my night classes, I know that,

44:27.165 --> 44:29.249
but I want to tell you everything
that's going on.

44:29.500 --> 44:32.294
Please don't mention it to Mammy, though.
You know what she's like.

44:33.963 --> 44:36.173
He's decent and kind,

44:36.257 --> 44:38.467
and he has a job and he works hard.

44:38.593 --> 44:40.218
We go to the cinema on Wednesdays

44:40.303 --> 44:43.347
and he takes me
to Father Flood's dance on Saturdays.

44:45.350 --> 44:48.352
I think of you and Mother every single day,

44:48.436 --> 44:51.897
but Tony has helped me
to feel that I have a life here

44:51.981 --> 44:54.441
I didn't have before I met him.

44:54.817 --> 44:55.984
My body was here,

44:56.110 --> 45:00.030
but my life was back in Ireland with you.

45:00.114 --> 45:02.449
Now it's halfway across the sea.

45:02.533 --> 45:04.493
So that's something, isn't it?

45:18.132 --> 45:20.258
Oh, and I'd better warn you about Frankie.

45:20.343 --> 45:22.844
- He's the little one?
- Yeah, he's eight going on 18.

45:22.970 --> 45:25.472
I mean, he's nice and he's smart,
but he's been talking

45:25.556 --> 45:28.266
and he's talking about all the things
he's gonna say to you.

45:28.351 --> 45:29.726
- What sort of things?
- We don't know.

45:29.811 --> 45:31.436
It could be anything.

45:31.521 --> 45:35.065
I mean, I tried to pay him money
to go out and play ball with his friends

45:35.149 --> 45:36.900
and my dad, he threatened him,

45:36.984 --> 45:39.778
but I think he's looking forward
to causing trouble,

45:39.862 --> 45:42.322
so much so he'll happily take a beating.

45:42.407 --> 45:44.324
This is us here.

45:44.826 --> 45:46.201
You ready?

46:02.009 --> 46:03.969
Hey, how did you learn
to eat spaghetti like that?

46:05.847 --> 46:09.683
- I've been taking lessons.
- Lessons? Like in a class?

46:09.767 --> 46:12.477
You can do that? Maybe I could teach it.

46:12.562 --> 46:14.980
No, no, Diana, who lives
in the boarding house with me

46:15.064 --> 46:16.523
cooked me some spaghetti

46:16.607 --> 46:19.568
and made me try and eat it
without making a mess.

46:19.694 --> 46:22.696
So what do you eat in Ireland?
Just Irish stew?

46:22.905 --> 46:24.156
Not just. We eat...

46:24.240 --> 46:27.451
So, first of all, I should say
that we don't like Irish people.

46:27.535 --> 46:28.952
- Hey, watch it.
- Frankie.

46:29.036 --> 46:32.289
What? We don't. That is a well-known fact.

46:32.373 --> 46:33.874
Why, Frankie?

46:33.958 --> 46:37.669
Cos a big gang of Irish beat Maurizio up
and he had to get stitches,

46:37.753 --> 46:41.465
and because all the cops around here are
Irish nobody did anything about it.

46:41.549 --> 46:43.675
There's probably two sides to it.

46:43.759 --> 46:45.927
I might have said something I shouldn't.

46:46.053 --> 46:47.471
You know, I can't remember now.

46:47.555 --> 46:48.930
No, because they beat you up.

46:49.056 --> 46:51.850
Anyway, they probably weren't all Irish.

46:51.934 --> 46:53.534
No, they just had red hair and big legs.

46:53.561 --> 46:55.061
All right, up.

46:55.146 --> 46:57.022
- Ow!
- Excuse us.

46:58.816 --> 47:01.526
All I can say in his defence is
he's the only one of us

47:01.611 --> 47:03.612
who'll get a college education.

47:03.738 --> 47:05.405
If he can keep his mouth shut.

47:05.990 --> 47:08.658
So, Tony tells me you go to college.

47:08.743 --> 47:11.495
Oh, just night classes.
I want to be a book-keeper.

47:11.579 --> 47:15.248
I like working in the shop well enough,
but I don't want to be there forever.

47:17.585 --> 47:19.252
I'm sorry, Eilis. I'm an idiot.

47:20.796 --> 47:22.005
I'm a rude idiot.

47:28.638 --> 47:32.474
So has Tony offered to take you
to Ebbets Field when the season starts?

47:33.935 --> 47:35.435
You like baseball?

47:36.521 --> 47:38.522
He never mentioned the Dodgers?

47:39.106 --> 47:40.106
Not even once?

47:40.191 --> 47:41.525
Tony,
what's the matter with you?

47:41.609 --> 47:43.860
You wanna know why? Too much of this.

47:43.945 --> 47:48.532
Anyway, you'll have to go to Ebbets Field
if you wanna see him in the summer.

47:48.616 --> 47:50.200
They're that important to you?

47:50.284 --> 47:53.995
Put it this way, if our kids end up
supporting the Yankees or the Giants,

47:54.121 --> 47:56.206
- it'd break my heart.
- Mine too.

47:59.961 --> 48:02.462
She's not laughing, Tony.
Think it's too late.

48:02.964 --> 48:04.756
She's a Yanks fan.

48:04.840 --> 48:07.676
What are you talking about?
What's wrong with you?

48:08.719 --> 48:10.637
She's a Yanks fan.

48:32.159 --> 48:33.702
I love you.

48:37.081 --> 48:38.415
I...

48:40.585 --> 48:44.004
Thank you for the evening. It was lovely.

49:07.028 --> 49:08.903
Oh! Sorry.

49:10.698 --> 49:12.365
I'd finished.

49:20.124 --> 49:22.125
Sheila, can I ask you something?

49:24.086 --> 49:25.253
Why aren't you married?

49:29.425 --> 49:32.260
Because my husband met somebody else
and left me.

49:32.720 --> 49:34.971
Oh... I'm sorry.

49:37.058 --> 49:39.893
And, well, would you get married again?

49:39.977 --> 49:41.978
- Has somebody asked you?
- No.

49:43.564 --> 49:44.564
Not really.

49:45.316 --> 49:47.108
I won't ask what that means.

49:48.319 --> 49:49.569
Would I get married again?

49:49.654 --> 49:51.154
No, I wanna be waiting

49:51.238 --> 49:54.240
outside the bathroom
of my boarding house forever.

49:54.408 --> 49:56.159
Of course I do.

49:56.243 --> 49:59.120
That's why I go to that
wretched dance every week.

49:59.288 --> 50:01.831
I want to be waiting
outside my own bathroom

50:02.500 --> 50:06.127
while some bad-tempered fella
with hair growing out of his ears

50:06.587 --> 50:08.922
reads the newspaper on the toilet.

50:09.757 --> 50:12.759
Then I'll wish I was back
here talking to you.

50:54.343 --> 50:55.802
Eilis!

50:56.804 --> 50:58.138
I'm sorry.

50:58.472 --> 50:59.723
I didn't think you were coming.

50:59.807 --> 51:01.975
Yeah, I know.
I thought you were gonna think that.

51:02.059 --> 51:04.728
That's why I wanted to be here
no matter what.

51:04.812 --> 51:06.612
- I need to say something to you.
- Can you...

51:06.647 --> 51:09.899
Can we just talk about something else
until we get to Mrs Kehoe's?

51:09.984 --> 51:11.651
- It's not...
- Please.

51:14.321 --> 51:15.697
So...

51:16.866 --> 51:20.785
Ten minutes before I'm supposed to meet you
and I'm standing ankle-deep in sewage

51:20.870 --> 51:23.121
that's pouring through
this old lady's ceiling.

51:23.205 --> 51:24.497
Yeah.

51:24.582 --> 51:27.083
Even if you're thinking of
inviting me in for a coffee,

51:27.168 --> 51:29.210
I'd have to say no for your sake.

51:29.336 --> 51:31.254
So how did you fix it in 10 minutes?

51:31.338 --> 51:33.798
I didn't. I spent the whole 10 minutes
explaining to the lady

51:33.883 --> 51:37.594
I had to be somewhere and I'd be back,
and she don't wanna let me go.

51:37.678 --> 51:40.513
So the sewage is still pouring
through the ceiling?

51:40.848 --> 51:41.848
Oh...

51:41.932 --> 51:45.685
Well, what's the difference between
six inches of sewage and a foot?

51:47.188 --> 51:49.272
Will you let me say what I want to say?

51:50.357 --> 51:52.400
I don't think you'll mind.

51:52.526 --> 51:53.610
OK.

51:56.739 --> 52:00.200
You remember that after
I had dinner at your house,

52:00.284 --> 52:02.368
you told me you loved me?

52:04.455 --> 52:06.873
Well, I didn't really know what to say.

52:08.626 --> 52:10.794
But I know what to say now.

52:12.713 --> 52:16.591
I have thought about you, and I like you.

52:18.219 --> 52:20.053
And I like being with you.

52:21.722 --> 52:23.097
And...

52:24.975 --> 52:27.936
maybe I feel the same way.

52:29.897 --> 52:32.232
So the next time you tell me you love me,

52:32.900 --> 52:34.984
if there is a next time...

52:36.612 --> 52:38.655
I'll say I love you too.

52:42.117 --> 52:43.743
Are you serious?

52:44.495 --> 52:45.620
Yes.

52:48.249 --> 52:49.833
Holy shit.

52:49.917 --> 52:52.001
Excuse my language,

52:52.086 --> 52:54.671
but I thought we were having
a different kind of talk.

52:56.257 --> 52:57.799
Can I go home now?

52:57.925 --> 52:59.050
You love me?

52:59.134 --> 53:01.678
Yes, but don't ask me anything else,

53:01.762 --> 53:03.930
and don't talk about our kids
being Dodgers fans.

53:04.014 --> 53:06.266
What, you want kids who like the Yankees?

53:06.350 --> 53:09.978
- Tony, please, don't push me.
- All right. I'm sorry.

53:12.356 --> 53:16.484
Dear Eilis.
Thank you so much for the nylons.

53:16.610 --> 53:20.613
The Bartocci wrapping paper
makes them look so glamorous.

53:21.365 --> 53:25.285
It seems everything is so exciting
and new compared to here.

53:26.203 --> 53:29.539
I can't wait for you
to show it all to me one day.

53:33.127 --> 53:34.711
Oh, Eilis,

53:35.379 --> 53:38.631
you know I'm by your side,
even when I'm not.

54:00.404 --> 54:01.821
Well...

54:04.658 --> 54:07.327
You're marvellous,
that's all I have to say.

54:07.828 --> 54:10.997
It looks to me as if
you didn't just pass those exams.

54:11.874 --> 54:13.917
No. You flew through them.

54:14.001 --> 54:17.211
I can't remember the last time
anyone came in here with good news.

54:17.338 --> 54:18.880
I've saved some money.

54:19.006 --> 54:22.175
I'll be able to pay for next year's tuition
and pay you back for last year.

54:22.384 --> 54:23.885
One of my parishioners paid.

54:24.178 --> 54:27.430
He needed to do something for mankind
and I won't tell you why.

54:27.556 --> 54:30.725
He's not out of the woods yet either,
so he can cough up for next year, too.

54:30.851 --> 54:32.310
I'd love to know what
sort of woods he's in.

54:32.394 --> 54:34.771
Yes, I'm sure you would,
but you won't hear it from me.

54:36.690 --> 54:39.651
Qualifications and a boyfriend, Eilis.

54:39.735 --> 54:42.987
You're not the miserable young girl
who wanted to go home last winter.

54:43.072 --> 54:45.198
It seems like years ago.

54:45.532 --> 54:49.410
Now, I think this is the first time

54:49.536 --> 54:54.374
any girl of mine has ever passed
an exam while living here.

54:57.962 --> 55:00.213
- Have you told Tony yet, Eilis?
- Of course.

55:00.297 --> 55:01.817
And is he taking you out to celebrate?

55:01.882 --> 55:04.175
We're going to Coney Island at the weekend.

55:04.259 --> 55:06.260
- Oh, boy.
- What does that mean?

55:06.387 --> 55:07.720
Do you have a bathing costume?

55:08.263 --> 55:10.348
- No, I was going to...
- Do you have sunglasses?

55:10.432 --> 55:12.100
- No.
- You need sunglasses.

55:12.226 --> 55:13.935
I read that if you don't have
them on the beach this year,

55:14.061 --> 55:15.561
people'll talk about you.

55:15.729 --> 55:17.939
And what exactly will they say, Sheila?

55:18.482 --> 55:20.274
That's the thing, Mrs Kehoe.

55:20.401 --> 55:23.069
You'd never know
cos they'd never say it to your face.

55:24.780 --> 55:28.116
Oh, dear God. Diana's right, though, Eilis.

55:28.242 --> 55:30.576
You need to think carefully
about your costume.

55:30.661 --> 55:34.247
It's the most Tony will ever have seen of
you and you don't want to put him off.

55:38.919 --> 55:40.253
You'll have to shave down there.

55:40.337 --> 55:42.057
I'll give you a razor that'll do the trick.

55:47.469 --> 55:48.928
You're all right there for the moment.

55:49.013 --> 55:51.305
And most Italian men
appreciate a fuller figure.

55:52.266 --> 55:54.267
But watch yourself over the summer.

55:55.936 --> 55:58.456
Black's too dark for your pale skin.
Let's see you in the green.

56:38.896 --> 56:42.023
Why didn't you tell me to put
my costume on underneath my clothes?

56:42.149 --> 56:43.858
I thought you'd know.

56:46.403 --> 56:48.404
Right, I'm ready.

56:56.580 --> 56:58.539
- Tony.
- What?

56:59.541 --> 57:00.708
Come on.

57:02.044 --> 57:05.046
Dear Rose.
Thank you for your letter.

57:05.172 --> 57:07.590
I was happy to hear
about your golf tournament.

57:07.674 --> 57:09.926
You must have been really pleased.

57:10.511 --> 57:14.055
I still miss you and Mother
and think about you every day,

57:14.181 --> 57:17.934
but I think I can say that for the
first time since I've been in America

57:18.018 --> 57:19.727
I'm really happy.

57:20.687 --> 57:22.730
This has a lot to do with Tony.

57:22.856 --> 57:25.483
At the weekend he took me
to see the Brooklyn Dodgers,

57:25.567 --> 57:27.944
the baseball team he loves.

57:28.028 --> 57:30.196
They lost, so he was annoyed.

57:30.280 --> 57:33.282
But I've also started to
look for office work too.

57:33.367 --> 57:37.286
I had an interview this week
at a textile firm here in Brooklyn.

57:37.371 --> 57:38.621
Rose.

57:38.705 --> 57:41.958
Who'd have thought there would be
two book-keepers in the family?

57:42.042 --> 57:43.084
Rose.

57:46.713 --> 57:49.924
I'll soon be able to afford
to come home and see you and Mammy.

57:53.303 --> 57:54.720
Rose?

57:58.433 --> 57:59.475
Rose.

57:59.726 --> 58:01.060
Oh, my God.

58:03.438 --> 58:06.232
Rose! Oh, Rose!

58:23.834 --> 58:25.251
One moment.

58:46.440 --> 58:48.107
It was sudden.

58:49.860 --> 58:53.112
I think perhaps she was ill,
and she knew she was ill,

58:53.322 --> 58:55.531
and she didn't tell anybody.

59:00.495 --> 59:02.997
- What'll happen?
- What can happen?

59:05.209 --> 59:07.793
When will they bury her? Tomorrow.

59:10.214 --> 59:12.632
- Without me?
- Without you.

59:13.717 --> 59:15.843
You're too far away, Eilis.

59:20.807 --> 59:22.892
Why did I ever come here?

59:23.644 --> 59:25.728
Rose wanted a better life for you.

59:26.021 --> 59:27.480
She loved how well you were doing.

59:27.648 --> 59:29.815
But I'll never see her again.

59:33.695 --> 59:35.613
That's right, isn't it, Father?

59:35.697 --> 59:37.823
I'll never see her again.

59:38.242 --> 59:40.660
You know that I think you will.

59:41.203 --> 59:44.330
And that she'll be watching over you
every day for the rest of your life.

01:00:12.442 --> 01:00:14.443
Hello. Mammy?

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:20.700
I can't really hear you.

01:00:23.036 --> 01:00:25.204
Well, the rain held off anyway.

01:00:27.291 --> 01:00:30.543
And the whole of her golf club came,
every single one of them.

01:00:31.378 --> 01:00:33.713
We had a real houseful afterwards.

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:38.384
Are you still there?

01:00:39.386 --> 01:00:40.720
Yes.

01:00:43.598 --> 01:00:45.891
People really loved her, Eilis.

01:00:46.893 --> 01:00:49.729
Her friends from work,
the neighbours, everybody.

01:00:52.566 --> 01:00:54.734
Nobody knew what to say to me.

01:00:58.238 --> 01:01:00.614
When your daddy died, I said to myself

01:01:00.741 --> 01:01:03.181
that I shouldn't grieve too much
because I had the two of you.

01:01:04.619 --> 01:01:05.870
And then when you went to America,

01:01:05.954 --> 01:01:09.290
I told myself the same thing
because she was here with me.

01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:12.626
But everyone's gone, Eilis. I have nobody.

01:01:33.607 --> 01:01:35.524
I can't bear it, Tony.

01:01:40.614 --> 01:01:45.451
You wanna go home, I guess.

01:01:48.997 --> 01:01:51.957
How would it be for you if I did go home?

01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:55.961
I'd be afraid every single day.

01:01:56.463 --> 01:01:58.964
Afraid that I wouldn't come back?

01:01:59.383 --> 01:02:00.800
Yeah.

01:02:01.385 --> 01:02:03.010
But home is home.

01:02:08.975 --> 01:02:10.976
I'm not sure I have a home any more.

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:19.652
You're not going to work tomorrow, are you?

01:02:20.404 --> 01:02:23.364
After the Mass, can I take you somewhere?

01:02:36.336 --> 01:02:37.753
This is it.

01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:42.216
We're gonna build five
houses here if we can

01:02:42.342 --> 01:02:44.927
and Mom and Dad, they're gonna have one

01:02:45.011 --> 01:02:48.097
cos Ma always wanted
a house with a backyard.

01:02:48.181 --> 01:02:49.932
We'll sell three.

01:02:50.725 --> 01:02:52.518
And the other one,

01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:55.104
my brothers, they asked me if I wanted it

01:02:55.188 --> 01:02:57.148
and I said that I did.

01:02:57.232 --> 01:03:02.278
So I guess what I'm saying is,
you wanna live out here on Long Island?

01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:05.114
I mean, I know it doesn't
look like much right now,

01:03:05.198 --> 01:03:07.199
but all the land around here has been sold,

01:03:07.284 --> 01:03:09.118
so we wouldn't be on our own,

01:03:09.202 --> 01:03:13.205
and there'd be telephone cables
and electricity, everything.

01:03:21.256 --> 01:03:23.549
We're gonna set up a company.

01:03:24.217 --> 01:03:26.802
A building company, the three of us.

01:03:26.887 --> 01:03:30.806
And I'm gonna do the plumbing
and Laurence'll do the carpentry and...

01:03:38.064 --> 01:03:40.149
Don't go all quiet on me.

01:03:41.151 --> 01:03:43.277
At least tell me you'll think about it.

01:03:47.908 --> 01:03:50.242
I don't need to think about it.

01:04:41.211 --> 01:04:43.212
It's just for a month or so.

01:04:45.298 --> 01:04:47.007
I know it'd make her feel a little better.

01:04:56.643 --> 01:04:59.061
Will you marry me before you leave?

01:05:02.649 --> 01:05:04.984
You don't trust me to come back?

01:05:07.529 --> 01:05:09.071
Marry me.

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:12.157
Marry me.

01:05:12.867 --> 01:05:14.952
We don't have to tell anybody.

01:05:15.036 --> 01:05:18.581
We just do it quickly,
just keep it between us.

01:05:21.585 --> 01:05:23.669
Why do you want to do it?

01:05:24.671 --> 01:05:27.590
Because if we don't, I'm gonna go crazy.

01:05:33.388 --> 01:05:35.848
Would a promise not be the same?

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:42.062
If you can promise, you can easily do this.

01:06:26.316 --> 01:06:29.652
So this is it. This is where you live.

01:06:30.153 --> 01:06:32.696
Yes,
and if you make one tiny noise,

01:06:32.781 --> 01:06:33.989
she'll evict me.

01:08:07.542 --> 01:08:09.752
There's no point in worrying now.

01:08:12.172 --> 01:08:13.839
Stay with me.

01:08:44.245 --> 01:08:45.912
You wanna play?

01:08:46.038 --> 01:08:48.122
- Yeah, sure.
- All right, here we go.

01:08:48.249 --> 01:08:50.375
One bat coming up, huh?

01:08:50.794 --> 01:08:53.462
I'll take that. All right, you ready?
Hands up.

01:08:53.587 --> 01:08:55.130
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:08:55.215 --> 01:08:57.424
Boom. Oh! Right down the third base line.

01:08:57.550 --> 01:08:58.634
Is he annoying you?

01:08:58.718 --> 01:09:00.719
- Cos he was annoying me.
- No, no, no, no.

01:09:00.845 --> 01:09:03.013
I got a brother the exact same age.

01:09:03.096 --> 01:09:05.515
- Hey, are you Irish?
- Is it so obvious?

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:09.060
I'm just about to marry an Irish girl,
so I guess I notice it more.

01:09:09.187 --> 01:09:10.587
There are a lot of you in Brooklyn.

01:09:10.688 --> 01:09:13.247
Sometimes it seems as though
there can't be anybody left at home.

01:09:13.358 --> 01:09:14.358
Where's your girl from?

01:09:14.442 --> 01:09:16.109
Enniscorthy in County Wexford.

01:09:16.236 --> 01:09:17.903
My wife has family there.

01:09:18.029 --> 01:09:20.029
Hey, Eilis. Come here a sec.

01:09:20.113 --> 01:09:23.617
Anthony Fiorello and Eilis Lacey.

01:09:23.743 --> 01:09:26.036
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:28.455
Come on, come over here. Come on.

01:09:36.965 --> 01:09:39.550
Will we ever tell our children we did this?

01:09:40.969 --> 01:09:43.720
Maybe we'll save it for some anniversary.

01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:47.599
I wonder what they'll think of it.

01:10:13.334 --> 01:10:15.919
- Nancy.
- You look so glamorous.

01:10:16.170 --> 01:10:18.005
I told you so.

01:10:18.131 --> 01:10:19.464
I'm so sorry about Rose.

01:10:20.258 --> 01:10:21.508
Thank you.

01:10:21.676 --> 01:10:23.135
How are you?

01:10:24.804 --> 01:10:25.804
No.

01:10:25.930 --> 01:10:28.181
I knew, but I wanted
to let Nancy tell you herself.

01:10:28.308 --> 01:10:30.225
I'm so glad you can come to the wedding.

01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:31.476
Can I?

01:10:31.603 --> 01:10:34.813
Your mother accepted
the invitation on your behalf.

01:10:34.939 --> 01:10:37.149
- When is it?
- The 27th of August.

01:10:37.317 --> 01:10:39.735
Will you come out with George
and me tomorrow night?

01:10:39.819 --> 01:10:41.445
Annette wants to see you, too.

01:10:41.529 --> 01:10:43.906
Oh, I don't mind.
I'll have to find you a key.

01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:45.449
I don't want you getting me out of bed.

01:10:45.533 --> 01:10:48.577
We all want to hear
what life in New York is like.

01:10:48.661 --> 01:10:50.829
I'll try and think of something to say.

01:10:58.463 --> 01:11:01.173
I'm booked to go back
to New York on the 21st.

01:11:02.050 --> 01:11:05.552
Well, you can wait an extra week
to see your best friend married.

01:11:42.548 --> 01:11:45.717
I can't believe I'm married
to someone you'll never know.

01:11:51.015 --> 01:11:53.016
But you'd like him.

01:11:53.893 --> 01:11:55.727
I know you would.

01:11:58.564 --> 01:12:00.273
He's sweet.

01:12:01.359 --> 01:12:02.901
And he's funny.

01:12:03.695 --> 01:12:06.571
And he's got these wonderful eyes that...

01:12:18.251 --> 01:12:20.919
I wish
everything were different.

01:12:40.606 --> 01:12:43.442
So, now, Mrs O'Toole from Cush.

01:12:43.568 --> 01:12:45.152
Do we really have to do this?

01:12:45.278 --> 01:12:48.572
Getting a letter of condolence isn't
like getting a birthday present, is it?

01:12:48.656 --> 01:12:52.284
What if Mrs O'Toole from Cush writes
back to thank you for your thank you?

01:12:52.410 --> 01:12:53.493
Then I'll thank her.

01:12:53.619 --> 01:12:55.996
And you'd be happy to spend
the rest of your life like that?

01:12:56.122 --> 01:12:59.166
It's not as if I've anything else to do
or anybody else to talk to.

01:12:59.292 --> 01:13:02.252
It might as well be Mrs O'Toole from Cush.

01:13:03.463 --> 01:13:04.880
What do you want me to say?

01:13:06.966 --> 01:13:10.469
- That'll be Nancy and Annette.
- Off you go.

01:13:14.432 --> 01:13:15.974
Enjoy yourself.

01:13:32.784 --> 01:13:34.493
Eilis, this is Jim Farrell.

01:13:35.787 --> 01:13:37.829
It's a great pleasure to meet you.

01:13:41.167 --> 01:13:43.085
We could try the Connaught Hotel bar.

01:13:43.169 --> 01:13:45.489
There may be a few of the fellas
from the rugby club there.

01:13:45.546 --> 01:13:47.130
OK.

01:13:48.341 --> 01:13:52.260
Do you have to be with other fellas
from the rugby club all the time?

01:13:52.345 --> 01:13:54.846
No.

01:13:54.972 --> 01:13:57.349
But Nancy told us we wouldn't
be allowed to talk to you

01:13:57.475 --> 01:14:01.353
cos you have too much to say to each other,
so we're just looking for company.

01:14:02.021 --> 01:14:03.188
Oh, well.

01:14:03.314 --> 01:14:05.440
Do you not like the fellas
from the rugby club, Eilis?

01:14:05.525 --> 01:14:07.359
I don't particularly, George.

01:14:07.485 --> 01:14:08.777
When I first went to America,

01:14:08.861 --> 01:14:12.155
I missed every single thing
about Enniscorthy except one.

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:14.032
We're not all the same.

01:14:14.367 --> 01:14:15.867
You all look the same.

01:14:15.993 --> 01:14:18.495
It's the blazer and the hair oil.

01:14:27.588 --> 01:14:28.713
Nancy.

01:14:31.217 --> 01:14:33.176
Where's Annette? And why has he come?

01:14:33.678 --> 01:14:36.513
He's very nice,
so don't be too hard on him.

01:14:36.597 --> 01:14:39.558
Is this the same Jim Farrell
that was engaged to Cathleen Cassidy?

01:14:39.684 --> 01:14:41.601
- What happened to her?
- He broke it off.

01:14:41.727 --> 01:14:43.562
He didn't think she was serious about him.

01:14:43.688 --> 01:14:46.565
He was very upset for a while,
but he's over her now.

01:14:47.525 --> 01:14:50.235
Nancy, I'm... I'm going back.

01:14:50.361 --> 01:14:53.697
But you can have a bit of fun
while you're here, can't you?

01:14:54.198 --> 01:14:55.907
Come on, George.

01:14:59.245 --> 01:15:01.037
How's your mother?

01:15:01.747 --> 01:15:04.958
She's... Well, she's sad.

01:15:05.418 --> 01:15:07.878
She's got much older very quickly.

01:15:08.754 --> 01:15:10.505
It was a terrible thing.

01:15:10.590 --> 01:15:12.132
We all went to the funeral Mass,

01:15:12.258 --> 01:15:14.426
Mother and Father and myself.

01:15:14.552 --> 01:15:16.219
I didn't know that.

01:15:16.304 --> 01:15:18.221
My mother played golf with her, you know.

01:15:18.306 --> 01:15:20.265
She was very fond of her.

01:15:20.391 --> 01:15:21.600
It was...

01:15:22.768 --> 01:15:26.396
It was the saddest thing to happen
in the town that I can remember.

01:15:27.607 --> 01:15:28.940
Thank you.

01:15:30.568 --> 01:15:32.569
Come on, you two.

01:15:37.241 --> 01:15:38.658
And what about the skyscrapers?

01:15:38.784 --> 01:15:40.410
Ah, but that's Manhattan.

01:15:40.494 --> 01:15:42.662
I live in Brooklyn and I work in Brooklyn,

01:15:42.788 --> 01:15:44.748
and if I go out, I go out in Brooklyn.

01:15:44.832 --> 01:15:46.750
All the skyscrapers are across the river.

01:15:46.918 --> 01:15:48.919
You don't make it sound
very glamorous.

01:15:49.003 --> 01:15:50.086
It's not, really.

01:15:50.171 --> 01:15:53.048
Not even, what do you call it,
the department store where you work?

01:15:53.132 --> 01:15:55.759
Oh, Bartocci's? Well,
it sells lovely things.

01:15:55.843 --> 01:15:58.970
But I can't afford many of them
and I don't like the work, so...

01:15:59.305 --> 01:16:00.805
What would you like to do?

01:16:02.016 --> 01:16:03.725
I want to do what Rose did.

01:16:03.809 --> 01:16:06.228
I want to work in an office
and deal with numbers.

01:16:06.312 --> 01:16:08.021
Well, you should call in at Davis's.

01:16:08.147 --> 01:16:10.357
They haven't managed
to replace Rose, you know.

01:16:10.483 --> 01:16:13.151
I'll be going back to New York
straight after the wedding.

01:16:13.277 --> 01:16:16.029
But you might want to earn
a little money in the meantime.

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:17.720
I'm sure they'd be glad to have you.

01:16:17.823 --> 01:16:19.157
You just want her to stay.

01:16:22.119 --> 01:16:23.286
I'm only thinking of Eilis.

01:16:23.454 --> 01:16:26.164
Do you hear that, Eilis?
He's only thinking of you.

01:16:34.548 --> 01:16:35.840
That's it, that's it.

01:16:35.967 --> 01:16:38.260
Remember, Mrs Grogan didn't notice a thing.

01:16:43.349 --> 01:16:44.891
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:16:45.017 --> 01:16:46.226
See you.

01:17:05.037 --> 01:17:06.871
How was your evening?

01:17:07.206 --> 01:17:09.374
It was very nice, thank you.

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:11.380
Was that Jim Farrell
I saw in the car with them?

01:17:12.712 --> 01:17:13.878
It was.

01:17:14.005 --> 01:17:16.298
His parents are moving, you know.
They're retiring to the country.

01:17:16.382 --> 01:17:18.216
He'll be in that big house on his own.

01:17:18.342 --> 01:17:20.385
- Is that right?
- Hmm.

01:17:21.554 --> 01:17:23.596
He's a catch for someone.

01:17:25.349 --> 01:17:26.766
Good night, Mammy.

01:17:38.863 --> 01:17:41.072
- Hello, Eilis.
- Hello, Mrs Brennan.

01:17:41.532 --> 01:17:43.533
Quite the star.

01:17:50.583 --> 01:17:52.792
- Thank goodness you're back.
- What's the matter?

01:17:52.918 --> 01:17:53.960
A lad from Davis's came round.

01:17:54.086 --> 01:17:55.628
They have a problem
in their accounts department.

01:17:55.755 --> 01:17:56.921
They need you up there straightaway.

01:17:57.048 --> 01:17:59.299
Is that all?
I'll just put the shopping away.

01:17:59.425 --> 01:18:00.425
No, no, leave it.

01:18:00.551 --> 01:18:01.801
Straightaway, the young fella said.

01:18:01.927 --> 01:18:03.511
It doesn't matter what he said, Mother.

01:18:03.596 --> 01:18:05.805
I'm not an employee.
I'd be doing them a favour.

01:18:05.931 --> 01:18:08.266
Please, let me do the shopping.

01:18:16.650 --> 01:18:18.902
The problem is that
it's our busy season,

01:18:18.986 --> 01:18:22.447
so all the mill workers and drivers
did overtime last week.

01:18:22.573 --> 01:18:24.991
Well, they filled out the overtime slips,

01:18:25.117 --> 01:18:28.578
but there's been nobody here to work it
all out and to add to the wage slips,

01:18:28.662 --> 01:18:30.830
and some of the men
have started to complain,

01:18:30.956 --> 01:18:32.415
and I can't blame them.

01:18:32.792 --> 01:18:35.293
As you can see, it's all a terrible mess.

01:18:38.130 --> 01:18:39.890
Well, if you leave me
for a couple of hours,

01:18:39.924 --> 01:18:42.717
I can work out a system
so that whoever comes in after me

01:18:42.802 --> 01:18:44.562
won't have any trouble.

01:18:53.979 --> 01:18:55.355
Hello, Eilis.

01:18:55.606 --> 01:18:58.358
Maria has been telling me
you've done the most marvellous job here.

01:18:58.484 --> 01:18:59.526
Thank you.

01:18:59.652 --> 01:19:02.654
We should have known you would, of course.
You're Rose's sister, after all.

01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:04.781
I'm told you have a
certificate in book-keeping.

01:19:04.865 --> 01:19:06.574
Is it American book-keeping?

01:19:06.659 --> 01:19:10.495
I got the certificate in America,
but the two systems are very similar.

01:19:10.830 --> 01:19:13.310
Well, we'll certainly need someone
to deal with wages and so on

01:19:13.374 --> 01:19:15.083
during the busy season.

01:19:15.167 --> 01:19:17.710
So I'd like you to continue
on a part-time basis.

01:19:17.878 --> 01:19:20.338
Let's see how that goes
and then we'll speak again.

01:19:20.506 --> 01:19:22.340
I'll be going back to
the United States soon.

01:19:22.842 --> 01:19:26.219
As I say, let's you and I speak again
before we make any firm decisions

01:19:26.345 --> 01:19:27.804
one way or the other.

01:19:29.723 --> 01:19:33.101
Yes, Mr Brown. Of course. Thank you.

01:19:33.185 --> 01:19:36.521
Now, if you go and see Maria,
she'll have your money for today.

01:20:38.876 --> 01:20:40.793
I'd forgotten.

01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:42.128
What?

01:20:43.255 --> 01:20:44.547
This.

01:20:46.592 --> 01:20:49.177
You have beaches in Brooklyn.

01:20:49.261 --> 01:20:51.804
Yes, but they're just very crowded.

01:20:52.389 --> 01:20:55.767
There'll probably be quite a few walkers
along here later.

01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:57.727
Yes.

01:20:58.270 --> 01:21:00.313
It's still not the same.

01:21:01.649 --> 01:21:03.483
I'm sure it's not.

01:21:05.152 --> 01:21:08.154
We don't really know anything
of the rest of the world.

01:21:09.281 --> 01:21:11.616
We must seem very backward to you now.

01:21:11.742 --> 01:21:13.368
Of course not.

01:21:13.452 --> 01:21:16.663
You seem calm and civilised and charming.

01:21:23.170 --> 01:21:24.796
Come on!

01:21:32.263 --> 01:21:33.555
My mother wanted you to know

01:21:33.639 --> 01:21:37.141
that the golf club is inaugurating
a prize in Rose's name.

01:21:39.812 --> 01:21:43.815
A special trophy for the best score
by a lady newcomer at the club.

01:21:45.276 --> 01:21:48.444
She was always very nice to the newcomers,
my mother says.

01:21:51.198 --> 01:21:53.157
I hope you're pleased.

01:21:55.828 --> 01:21:57.203
Yes.

01:21:58.330 --> 01:21:59.872
Of course.

01:22:01.834 --> 01:22:07.338
So every year someone will win
the Rose Lacey Trophy?

01:22:08.465 --> 01:22:10.300
Yeah, every year,

01:22:10.384 --> 01:22:12.802
as long as there's a golf club.

01:22:16.849 --> 01:22:20.602
And I think she'd like you to come along

01:22:20.686 --> 01:22:23.187
and present it to the first winner.

01:22:26.734 --> 01:22:29.054
Yeah, and my mother would like
to meet you too, by the way.

01:22:31.363 --> 01:22:34.699
I'm supposed to arrange a time
when you can come around for tea.

01:22:35.868 --> 01:22:38.161
Thank you. I'd like that.

01:22:43.542 --> 01:22:46.085
I wish it had been like this before I went.

01:22:47.046 --> 01:22:48.755
Before Rose died.

01:22:49.882 --> 01:22:51.215
Like what?

01:22:52.343 --> 01:22:54.594
There was nothing here for me before

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:56.721
and now I have a job and...

01:22:57.389 --> 01:22:58.598
Here?

01:23:13.864 --> 01:23:15.198
Is that an American trick?

01:23:15.282 --> 01:23:16.699
Yes. It's a good one, isn't it?

01:23:19.411 --> 01:23:22.705
It's depressing, though,
that we don't think of things like that, isn't it?

01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:25.500
I mean, how long have they known about it?

01:23:25.584 --> 01:23:26.876
A hundred years, probably.

01:23:27.419 --> 01:23:31.089
I don't think they had bathing suits
like that a hundred years ago.

01:23:32.091 --> 01:23:34.092
We still don't have them now.

01:23:37.221 --> 01:23:38.471
Well, come on.

01:23:46.438 --> 01:23:48.815
You wanna go see the Dodgers on Saturday?

01:23:48.941 --> 01:23:50.566
- Sure.
- OK.

01:23:50.651 --> 01:23:52.944
- Will you do something for me?
- What?

01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:56.864
If you laugh or you say anything about this
to anybody in the family,

01:23:56.949 --> 01:23:59.242
you don't get to go see
the Dodgers on Saturday

01:23:59.326 --> 01:24:00.993
or any other day of the season.

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:02.370
Also you get a beating.

01:24:02.454 --> 01:24:04.914
Maybe it's just better
if I don't get involved.

01:24:04.998 --> 01:24:06.833
I really need your help, Frankie.

01:24:06.959 --> 01:24:09.199
You know you're the best
writer and reader in the family?

01:24:09.336 --> 01:24:11.379
- Yeah.
- I'm trying to write to Eilis.

01:24:11.463 --> 01:24:14.716
And I want it to be... I don't know.

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:17.301
You've wrote before
already about five times.

01:24:17.469 --> 01:24:20.138
Yeah, but they're no good, Frankie, and...

01:24:22.683 --> 01:24:25.184
She's only written back once.

01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:27.228
She's never read my writing before.

01:24:27.312 --> 01:24:29.981
I'm worried I'm putting her off me.

01:24:30.107 --> 01:24:32.191
Listen, I'm eight years old.

01:24:32.317 --> 01:24:33.818
I don't know anything about kissing.

01:24:34.027 --> 01:24:36.696
You don't need to know
anything about kissing.

01:24:36.822 --> 01:24:39.699
You need to know about
spelling and... And...

01:24:40.117 --> 01:24:42.660
- Grammar.
- Yeah. Will you look?

01:24:51.837 --> 01:24:53.629
Dear Eilis.

01:24:53.714 --> 01:24:56.716
I hope that you are doing well in Ireland.

01:24:56.842 --> 01:24:59.844
I hope that your mother's feeling less sad.

01:25:00.846 --> 01:25:03.931
It will not be long before
your friend gets married

01:25:04.016 --> 01:25:06.184
and you can come home.

01:25:08.854 --> 01:25:12.398
This week, it's like the whole world's
basements are flooding.

01:25:12.524 --> 01:25:14.192
I've fixed three.

01:25:15.402 --> 01:25:18.529
I've been working hard.
I've been saving money.

01:25:19.573 --> 01:25:22.116
Everybody asks me about you all the time.

01:25:22.201 --> 01:25:23.951
You missed out an "E," I think.

01:25:24.036 --> 01:25:26.162
It's "everybody."

01:25:28.207 --> 01:25:30.917
Anyway, I think that is all my news.

01:25:31.043 --> 01:25:34.587
Mom and Dad and all my brothers,
they all say hello.

01:25:35.714 --> 01:25:38.883
I think about you most
minutes of most days.

01:25:40.385 --> 01:25:42.720
Even when I go see the Dodgers,

01:25:42.846 --> 01:25:45.389
I do not concentrate on the games.

01:25:46.934 --> 01:25:49.227
With love, your Tony.

01:26:47.619 --> 01:26:49.120
No hair oil.

01:26:49.663 --> 01:26:52.164
And that's not a blazer.
It's a sports jacket.

01:26:52.291 --> 01:26:53.749
Have you come out in disguise, Jim Farrell?

01:26:53.834 --> 01:26:55.918
Are you trying to trick me?

01:26:57.296 --> 01:26:59.463
No. I knew what you meant

01:26:59.590 --> 01:27:01.340
when you said we were all the same.

01:27:02.092 --> 01:27:04.969
It made me think that my life
must seem very easy to you.

01:27:05.137 --> 01:27:06.762
I run my father's bar.

01:27:06.847 --> 01:27:09.682
I'm going to live in my parents' house.

01:27:09.808 --> 01:27:12.810
I know what that must look like
from the outside, but...

01:27:14.146 --> 01:27:15.813
It doesn't feel like that.

01:27:17.316 --> 01:27:19.275
What does it feel like?

01:27:22.154 --> 01:27:24.113
And I've never been anywhere.

01:27:24.197 --> 01:27:26.532
I've never even been to England

01:27:26.658 --> 01:27:30.703
but I'd like to see London and Paris
and Rome. New York.

01:27:31.663 --> 01:27:35.333
It frightens me, the idea of dying
without ever leaving Ireland.

01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:37.793
And there are other things too.

01:27:39.004 --> 01:27:41.714
I'm so sorry, I wanted to
ask you a thousand things

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:43.841
and all I've done is talked.

01:27:43.967 --> 01:27:45.301
I'm glad.

01:27:45.844 --> 01:27:47.678
- Really?
- Yes.

01:27:50.182 --> 01:27:53.059
Will you finish that
wretched pipe and sit with us?

01:27:53.185 --> 01:27:54.865
I can hear perfectly well from where I am.

01:27:54.895 --> 01:27:56.815
We're not here to provide you
with entertainment.

01:27:56.855 --> 01:27:58.175
Oh, don't you worry.

01:27:58.231 --> 01:27:59.815
I found that out many years ago.

01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:01.442
Just ignore him, Eilis.

01:28:01.526 --> 01:28:03.319
It's as well
Jim takes after me, not him.

01:28:03.487 --> 01:28:04.528
Speak up.

01:28:05.197 --> 01:28:07.114
Are you looking forward to your move?

01:28:07.199 --> 01:28:10.284
We'll miss Enniscorthy,
but it's lovely and quiet in Glenbrien.

01:28:10.369 --> 01:28:12.787
Mother's worried about
leaving me here on me own.

01:28:12.871 --> 01:28:14.163
She thinks I'll destroy the place.

01:28:14.247 --> 01:28:16.457
Well, I'm hoping you won't
be on your own forever.

01:28:16.541 --> 01:28:17.875
I'm sure he won't.

01:28:19.252 --> 01:28:20.753
I mean...

01:28:23.256 --> 01:28:24.896
God, aren't we blessed with this weather?

01:28:25.217 --> 01:28:26.509
It's lovely.

01:28:27.678 --> 01:28:29.845
The summers
in New York are hot, eh?

01:28:30.430 --> 01:28:32.056
They can be, yes.

01:28:32.182 --> 01:28:34.517
It can get quite humid sometimes.

01:28:42.275 --> 01:28:44.068
Dear Tony.

01:28:44.569 --> 01:28:47.238
Thank you for your letters.

01:28:47.364 --> 01:28:49.532
I want you to know that...

01:28:53.036 --> 01:28:55.246
I don't know what I want you to know.

01:29:08.385 --> 01:29:10.425
I don't want to be sitting
right at the back.

01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:12.805
We'll make sure you get
the best seats in the house.

01:29:12.931 --> 01:29:16.392
But it wouldn't feel right sitting up there
with Nancy and George.

01:29:16.727 --> 01:29:19.562
We'll find the second best
seats in the house, then.

01:29:21.648 --> 01:29:25.192
Would you like me to run ahead
and save you a couple of places, Mrs Lacey?

01:29:25.277 --> 01:29:27.319
Would you mind, Jim? That'd be grand.

01:29:31.116 --> 01:29:33.617
- Such a gentleman, isn't he?
- He is.

01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:37.621
Came along at just the right time for us.

01:29:40.292 --> 01:29:42.043
I invite you now, Nancy,

01:29:42.127 --> 01:29:45.087
to declare before God and his Church

01:29:45.172 --> 01:29:48.799
your consent to become George's wife.

01:29:50.510 --> 01:29:55.639
I promise to be true to you
in good times and in bad,

01:29:55.766 --> 01:29:58.267
in sickness and in health.

01:29:58.351 --> 01:30:03.105
I will love you and honour you
all the days of my life.

01:30:04.524 --> 01:30:06.317
The rings.

01:30:11.364 --> 01:30:13.949
Lord, bless these rings.

01:30:14.034 --> 01:30:16.577
Grant that those who wear them

01:30:16.661 --> 01:30:20.039
may always be faithful to each other.

01:30:20.165 --> 01:30:21.832
May they do your will

01:30:21.958 --> 01:30:25.503
and live in peace with you in mutual love.

01:30:25.629 --> 01:30:29.507
We ask this through Christ our Lord, amen.

01:30:29.841 --> 01:30:31.342
Amen.

01:30:40.018 --> 01:30:42.937
Your mother tells me
things are working out very well

01:30:43.021 --> 01:30:45.189
for you in Enniscorthy, Eilis.

01:30:46.066 --> 01:30:47.733
It was a lovely service.

01:30:47.859 --> 01:30:51.529
And Mr and Mrs Farrell
are moving out to Glenbrien,

01:30:51.655 --> 01:30:54.073
- so Jim'll...
- Yes, I know.

01:30:55.033 --> 01:30:57.353
Jim and I promised my mother
we'd take her back to the car.

01:30:57.410 --> 01:31:02.206
Mmm! Do you hear that?
"Jim and I. Jim and I."

01:31:02.332 --> 01:31:04.542
It won't be long now by the sound of it

01:31:04.668 --> 01:31:06.877
and your mother will have
a wonderful day out.

01:31:08.213 --> 01:31:09.213
Will you excuse me?

01:31:09.548 --> 01:31:11.507
There they are.

01:31:11.591 --> 01:31:13.884
- Hello, Mrs Byrne. How are you?
- Jack.

01:31:19.933 --> 01:31:21.058
Can we talk?

01:31:23.395 --> 01:31:24.770
What about?

01:31:27.023 --> 01:31:28.524
The future.

01:31:29.234 --> 01:31:32.862
I can't let you just go back to America
without saying anything.

01:31:34.614 --> 01:31:37.032
I'd regret it for the rest of my life.

01:31:39.035 --> 01:31:40.202
So...

01:31:41.079 --> 01:31:43.080
I don't want you to go.

01:31:44.082 --> 01:31:47.042
I want you to stay here with me.

01:31:49.921 --> 01:31:53.132
And I know that means
asking you another question

01:31:54.718 --> 01:31:57.094
but I don't want to bombard you.

01:31:58.597 --> 01:32:00.973
So I'll save that one for later.

01:32:06.438 --> 01:32:07.771
Thank you.

01:32:11.443 --> 01:32:12.943
I'm grateful.

01:32:14.112 --> 01:32:16.071
And I'm flattered.

01:32:18.283 --> 01:32:20.284
- That's all?
- No.

01:32:21.745 --> 01:32:23.746
No, of course not.

01:32:29.461 --> 01:32:30.794
I just...

01:32:33.673 --> 01:32:36.508
I'd imagined a different life for myself.

01:32:37.302 --> 01:32:38.969
I understand.

01:32:40.096 --> 01:32:42.640
But your life here could be just as good.

01:32:43.767 --> 01:32:45.768
Better even maybe.

01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:28.352
Mary.

01:33:29.145 --> 01:33:31.230
- I was just coming to fetch you.
- To fetch me?

01:33:31.564 --> 01:33:33.482
I haven't worked for Miss Kelly
for a long time, Mary.

01:33:33.566 --> 01:33:35.359
Please come, Eilis.

01:33:35.485 --> 01:33:37.278
She told me not to come back without you.

01:33:37.362 --> 01:33:38.487
You know what she's like.

01:33:50.041 --> 01:33:53.752
You look after things for five minutes while
I'm upstairs with Eilis, please, Mary.

01:33:53.878 --> 01:33:55.379
There are no customers
in there at the moment,

01:33:55.505 --> 01:33:58.048
so I don't think you can make
too much of a mess of things.

01:34:19.946 --> 01:34:22.406
So, how have you been getting on?

01:34:24.034 --> 01:34:25.576
Very well, thanks, Miss Kelly.

01:34:25.702 --> 01:34:28.203
I heard that you're
working over in Davis's,

01:34:28.288 --> 01:34:30.289
in the accounts department.

01:34:30.415 --> 01:34:31.623
That's right.

01:34:31.750 --> 01:34:35.169
And there's lots of talk
about you and young Jim Farrell.

01:34:35.253 --> 01:34:38.464
Oh, well, you know what people are like.
They love to talk.

01:34:38.798 --> 01:34:39.923
Yes.

01:34:41.634 --> 01:34:44.219
Do you remember Mrs Brady?

01:34:46.264 --> 01:34:49.475
She usually comes into the shop
on Sunday morning for her rashers.

01:34:52.228 --> 01:34:53.437
No?

01:34:54.314 --> 01:34:56.899
Well, you have a very busy life now,

01:34:56.983 --> 01:34:58.776
what with one thing and another.

01:35:00.070 --> 01:35:05.074
Anyway, Mrs Brady has a niece
living in Brooklyn.

01:35:08.912 --> 01:35:11.622
The world is a small place, isn't it?

01:35:12.290 --> 01:35:14.792
She had a letter from her
a couple of weeks back.

01:35:17.504 --> 01:35:19.296
And what did it say?

01:35:19.464 --> 01:35:22.549
Oh, only that she'd been to a wedding

01:35:22.634 --> 01:35:24.468
at the city hall

01:35:24.969 --> 01:35:28.639
and her husband bumped into a girl
from Enniscorthy

01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:31.475
who was getting married there.

01:35:34.312 --> 01:35:36.438
I'm not sure what you're telling me,
Miss Kelly.

01:35:36.523 --> 01:35:37.856
He didn't bump into me.

01:35:38.108 --> 01:35:41.485
Oh, you can't fool me, Miss Lacey.

01:35:42.821 --> 01:35:47.199
Although I'm not sure that
that's your name any longer, is it?

01:35:47.826 --> 01:35:49.660
He couldn't remember.

01:35:50.662 --> 01:35:52.788
Something Italian, he thought.

01:35:59.838 --> 01:36:01.338
I'd forgotten.

01:36:01.423 --> 01:36:04.591
You'd forgotten? What a thing...

01:36:04.676 --> 01:36:07.177
I'd forgotten what this town is like.

01:36:11.599 --> 01:36:14.143
What were you planning to do, Miss Kelly?

01:36:15.603 --> 01:36:17.688
Keep me away from Jim?

01:36:18.982 --> 01:36:21.525
Stop me from going back to America?

01:36:24.028 --> 01:36:26.113
Perhaps you didn't even know.

01:36:33.288 --> 01:36:36.957
My name is Eilis Fiorello.

01:37:09.908 --> 01:37:12.326
- Putting you through now.
- Thank you.

01:37:12.410 --> 01:37:13.827
How can I help?

01:37:13.912 --> 01:37:15.746
Hello. I'd like to make a reservation

01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:18.999
for the next available sailing
from Cobh to New York.

01:37:19.417 --> 01:37:22.336
I think people spend even more money
after a wedding.

01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:24.671
Nancy's mother must have been
in every shop in the town.

01:37:24.756 --> 01:37:26.507
She was buying firelighters in Broom's.

01:37:26.758 --> 01:37:28.509
Firelighters in August.

01:37:28.593 --> 01:37:31.153
But she'd seen Mrs Stapleton in there
and she hadn't had a chance

01:37:31.179 --> 01:37:33.847
to go through the whole
day in detail with her...

01:37:35.767 --> 01:37:37.226
Eilis, what's the matter?

01:37:37.393 --> 01:37:38.769
Has something happened with Jim?

01:37:40.438 --> 01:37:42.523
Mammy, I'm sorry.

01:37:43.900 --> 01:37:45.442
I'm so sorry.

01:37:46.778 --> 01:37:48.195
I'm married.

01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:52.199
I got married in Brooklyn
before I came home.

01:37:52.283 --> 01:37:54.201
And I should have told you.

01:37:54.285 --> 01:37:57.079
I should have told you
as soon as I got back.

01:38:01.751 --> 01:38:03.752
I want to be with him.

01:38:05.463 --> 01:38:07.089
I want to be with my husband.

01:38:10.301 --> 01:38:11.760
Of course.

01:38:14.639 --> 01:38:15.639
Is he nice?

01:38:18.059 --> 01:38:19.142
Yes.

01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:21.562
He'd have to be nice if you married him.

01:38:24.399 --> 01:38:26.400
So you're going back?

01:38:27.819 --> 01:38:31.071
Yes. Tomorrow.

01:38:34.659 --> 01:38:36.910
Are you on the early train?

01:38:41.833 --> 01:38:43.250
I'm going to bed.

01:38:44.252 --> 01:38:47.588
Mammy, it's not even 8:00.
You don't have to.

01:38:47.672 --> 01:38:49.256
I'm very tired.

01:38:50.592 --> 01:38:53.093
And I'd like to say goodbye now.

01:38:55.305 --> 01:38:57.306
And only once.

01:39:30.882 --> 01:39:33.467
Perhaps you'll write and tell me about him.

01:39:33.551 --> 01:39:34.635
I will.

01:39:36.012 --> 01:39:37.721
Good night, Eilis.

01:41:54.025 --> 01:41:56.193
So are you away to live in America?

01:41:57.612 --> 01:42:00.155
- No.
- Just visiting?

01:42:01.324 --> 01:42:03.617
No, I live there already.

01:42:03.701 --> 01:42:06.119
Really? What's it like?

01:42:07.288 --> 01:42:09.289
It's a big place.

01:42:11.542 --> 01:42:13.835
I'm gonna live in Brooklyn, New York.

01:42:14.629 --> 01:42:16.296
Do you know it?

01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:19.049
Yes.

01:42:20.551 --> 01:42:23.970
People say that there are
so many Irish people there,

01:42:24.055 --> 01:42:25.555
it's like home.

01:42:29.018 --> 01:42:30.227
Is that right?

01:42:35.233 --> 01:42:36.399
Yes.

01:42:37.193 --> 01:42:39.027
It's just like home.

01:42:51.833 --> 01:42:53.667
You're not to eat.

01:42:54.377 --> 01:42:55.877
But I might be there years.

01:42:56.504 --> 01:42:58.171
No, you can eat when you get there.

01:42:58.256 --> 01:42:59.589
Don't eat on the boat.

01:42:59.715 --> 01:43:01.758
It'll stop you getting so sick.
Do you promise me?

01:43:03.052 --> 01:43:04.177
I promise.

01:43:04.262 --> 01:43:06.680
And in a moment I want you to go
straight down to your cabin

01:43:06.764 --> 01:43:09.099
and lock the bathroom door on your side.

01:43:09.225 --> 01:43:12.352
When next door starts hammering,
you can negotiate.

01:43:13.771 --> 01:43:16.773
When you get to immigration,
keep your eyes wide open.

01:43:16.899 --> 01:43:18.859
Look as if you know where you're going.

01:43:18.943 --> 01:43:21.236
You have to think like an American.

01:43:23.531 --> 01:43:26.867
You'll feel so homesick
that you'll want to die

01:43:26.951 --> 01:43:30.120
and there's nothing you can do about it
apart from endure it.

01:43:31.956 --> 01:43:34.875
But you will, and it won't kill you.

01:43:49.557 --> 01:43:52.726
And one day the sun will come out.

01:43:52.810 --> 01:43:54.811
You might not even notice straightaway,

01:43:54.937 --> 01:43:56.771
it'll be that faint.

01:43:57.315 --> 01:44:01.318
And then you'll catch yourself
thinking about something or someone

01:44:01.402 --> 01:44:04.279
who has no connection with the past,

01:44:05.656 --> 01:44:08.158
someone who's only yours,

01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:11.161
and you'll realise...

01:44:13.414 --> 01:44:15.999
...that this is where your life is.
