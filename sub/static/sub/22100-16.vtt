WEBVTT

00:03.212 --> 00:05.505
ROSLIN: Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.

00:06.173 --> 00:08.758
I started thinking about
damages you can't see.

00:08.842 --> 00:11.094
Hairline fractures
in all the beams.

00:11.178 --> 00:13.262
It's throughout
the entire ship.

00:13.514 --> 00:14.889
It's our baby, Saul.

00:14.973 --> 00:17.141
We'd come to believe
that a lack of God's love

00:17.226 --> 00:20.186
is what prevented us
from biological reproduction.

00:20.729 --> 00:22.146
And our love
produced a child.

00:22.564 --> 00:24.107
Let him go now. Take him now.

00:24.191 --> 00:25.692
Saul, stay with the Fleet.

00:25.776 --> 00:26.776
It's all starting to happen.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.194
It's the miracle. Right here.

00:28.278 --> 00:29.404
Stay with the Fleet!

00:32.032 --> 00:33.032
No.

00:38.122 --> 00:39.664
Ellen, you're the Fifth.

00:40.332 --> 00:41.457
What are you doing?

00:41.542 --> 00:42.667
Forgiving you.

01:08.318 --> 01:09.902
Is this gonna work?

01:09.987 --> 01:11.738
I have no idea, sir.

01:13.490 --> 01:15.074
This is the stuff?

01:15.159 --> 01:16.284
Yeah.

01:18.162 --> 01:19.954
Can I touch it?
Yeah.

01:20.831 --> 01:22.206
It's gooey.

01:22.291 --> 01:25.168
But it hardens,
becomes like cartilage.

01:25.252 --> 01:26.711
It's flexible and strong.

01:26.795 --> 01:29.172
It's what the Baseship's
made of.

01:31.675 --> 01:33.176
Is this alive?

01:34.178 --> 01:35.845
MARINE: Heads up.

01:37.681 --> 01:40.183
Heads up, marines. Stay back.

01:47.900 --> 01:49.692
Stay back and everyone
will get their share!

01:49.777 --> 01:51.027
Stay back!

01:51.403 --> 01:52.653
Stay back! Stay back!

01:52.738 --> 01:54.947
Everyone'll get their share.
Stay back!

01:55.032 --> 01:56.240
MAN: Hey, Cylon.

01:57.993 --> 01:59.118
I don't want any trouble.

01:59.203 --> 02:01.078
MAN: Well, you got trouble.

02:02.581 --> 02:03.581
(GRUNTS)

02:23.101 --> 02:24.685
This better work.

02:34.071 --> 02:36.155
Kid's got a heart
like a kettledrum.

02:36.240 --> 02:39.325
Go on, get out of here. Make
room for some sick people.

(SIGHS)

02:40.452 --> 02:41.452
(EXHALES)

02:41.912 --> 02:44.539
I think you should
stay here for the night.

02:44.623 --> 02:46.749
I don't trust that machine.

02:47.668 --> 02:50.628
I know.
The irony is irresistible.

02:52.297 --> 02:54.048
The baby's fine.

02:54.132 --> 02:55.591
Liam is fine.

02:56.552 --> 02:59.220
You know I'd sleep better
at home with you.

03:01.682 --> 03:02.682

03:03.433 --> 03:04.851
ADAMA: Sitrep.
Sir,

03:04.935 --> 03:06.352
we're picking up
a bogey on dradis.

03:06.436 --> 03:09.605
Raptor. Squawks Colonial,
but it's not on the roster.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.901
It's one of ours, but we logged
it as lost over a year ago, sir.

03:18.949 --> 03:20.700
PILOT OVER RADIO: (GARBLED)
Galactica, permission to board.

03:20.784 --> 03:23.202
Raptor 702, your
transmission's all garbled.

03:23.287 --> 03:25.496
If you can hear me,
give me a flash.

03:26.915 --> 03:30.209
Copy, 702.
Galactica, they're receiving.

03:30.961 --> 03:32.128
NO. 6: Red Leader, Red Turkey,

03:32.212 --> 03:33.713
the voice,
I think that's an Eight.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.257
Starbuck, Galactica actual.

03:36.341 --> 03:38.467
ADAMA: Report.
Galactica, Red Leader.

03:38.552 --> 03:41.846
Our Heavy Raider buddy's
calling the inbound a "Sharon. "

03:42.514 --> 03:43.806
An Eight.

03:47.811 --> 03:49.061
Starbuck, bring it in.

03:49.146 --> 03:50.229
STARBUCK: Roger that.

04:26.016 --> 04:29.936
Oh, my Gods.
That's Ellen Tigh.

04:30.020 --> 04:31.020
Bill.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.105
How many dead chicks
are out there?

04:37.611 --> 04:40.363
ELLEN: I can't tell you
how happy I am to see you.

04:40.447 --> 04:43.199
Aren't you gonna help a lady
down off this thing?

04:49.706 --> 04:51.374
Nice to see you again.

04:52.876 --> 04:54.210
This is Boomer.

04:56.588 --> 04:57.880
Marines.
MARINE: Sir.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.383
Take this Number Eight
to the brig.

(THEME MUSIC)

06:10.370 --> 06:12.663
He wants to
rebuild Resurrection?

06:13.373 --> 06:16.709
He wants us to rebuild it.

06:16.793 --> 06:20.379
I really think Cavil's
completely unbalanced.

06:20.464 --> 06:23.549
It's too much for him,
the thought that the...

06:24.217 --> 06:27.845
The only hope for the Cylon
people is this desperate grab

06:27.929 --> 06:33.517
for procreation, evolution, all that
messy biological trial and error.

06:34.770 --> 06:36.270
Oh, dear.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.647
I'm totally throwing you,
aren't I?

06:39.149 --> 06:40.608
I'm still Ellen, you know.

06:40.692 --> 06:41.692
Hmm.

06:46.156 --> 06:48.949
Does anyone have
something to drink?

06:49.159 --> 06:50.826
Maybe a flask?

06:59.836 --> 07:02.421
ROSLIN: So Boomer
helped you escape.

07:02.506 --> 07:04.840
Yes. I hope you won't
treat her too badly.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.926
You don't need to
worry about Boomer.

07:12.599 --> 07:15.684
May I see them?
The others?

07:16.228 --> 07:18.187
Galen, Tory and Sam?

07:20.440 --> 07:23.984
Imagine, Bill, Laura, imagine

07:24.736 --> 07:29.115
instead of 50,000 survivors,

07:29.199 --> 07:31.033
there are only five.

07:33.703 --> 07:35.079
Five people.

07:35.747 --> 07:37.873
Imagine how close you'd be.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.459
And then to have
all that torn away.

07:41.962 --> 07:45.256
It's all right, Ellen.
It's over now.

07:47.509 --> 07:49.552
How much do you remember?

07:49.636 --> 07:51.554
Not much from before.

07:52.931 --> 07:54.056
Flashes.

07:55.725 --> 07:58.102
Samuel Anders was
badly injured.

07:58.186 --> 07:59.895
He's not responding.

08:00.355 --> 08:03.149
ELLEN: Oh, my God. He's not
dead, Ellen. There's hope.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.192
I want to see him.

08:05.277 --> 08:07.778
I want to see him
and the others.

08:15.412 --> 08:17.329
We'll see what we can do.

08:30.051 --> 08:32.178
I can't believe you're here.

08:37.350 --> 08:40.102
There is so much
I have to ask you.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.271
There's so...

08:42.606 --> 08:43.689
I have to tell you.

08:43.773 --> 08:44.773
Mmm.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.859
You'd better say it fast.

08:47.068 --> 08:48.485

09:39.371 --> 09:41.997
So this is all that's left
from that first batch, right?

09:42.082 --> 09:44.500
WOMAN 1: Okay, I think
I already marked that down.

09:44.626 --> 09:47.628
So, if we're gonna...
Perfect.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.426

do we have exactly?

09:54.511 --> 09:56.053

10:14.990 --> 10:16.782

10:16.866 --> 10:19.702
We were wondering
if you were coming back.

10:21.413 --> 10:22.705
(LAUGHING NERVOUSLY)

10:23.748 --> 10:24.915
If?

10:26.626 --> 10:30.379
Of course I was coming back!
Of course I was.

10:31.256 --> 10:33.882
So, what did I miss?

10:35.593 --> 10:37.845
What's been going on?

10:38.972 --> 10:40.180
(SCOFFS)

10:40.265 --> 10:42.766
Well, it got pretty bad
after you left, Gaius.

10:43.101 --> 10:46.979
They'd bring us supplies and men
would come and take them away by force.

10:47.397 --> 10:48.856
It was...

10:50.984 --> 10:53.277
We were very tired, Gaius.

10:53.737 --> 10:55.779
Well, we realized
we'd been abandoned

10:56.156 --> 10:58.532
and we had to take
care of ourselves.

11:01.411 --> 11:03.120
Abandoned?

11:03.204 --> 11:05.039
I... How could you...

11:05.123 --> 11:06.665
I wouldn't say that.
I wouldn't say...

11:06.750 --> 11:08.459
Abandoned by God.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.421
That I might...
I might say that.

11:13.757 --> 11:17.259
There were dead men in the
halls with guns in their hands.

11:17.761 --> 11:19.386
So we took their guns.

11:20.263 --> 11:23.766
Now we can protect our food
and we can protect ourselves.

11:23.933 --> 11:25.309
All of this...

11:25.393 --> 11:27.436
All of this is food, Gaius.

11:27.729 --> 11:30.230
We're taking care
of ourselves now.

11:30.607 --> 11:33.901
I knew if I stayed away
that you'd find the strength.

11:34.444 --> 11:35.903
And you have.

11:36.529 --> 11:39.573
It's one of the reasons why I
stayed away as long as I did.

11:39.657 --> 11:41.784
Hmm. That was wise
of you, Gaius.

11:46.289 --> 11:48.374
The sheep have a new
shepherd, Gaius.

11:48.458 --> 11:49.917
Yes. Hmm.

11:54.839 --> 11:57.049
That's what I call
a big welcome.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.634
Very impressive.

12:02.263 --> 12:03.972
So who'd you frak?

12:04.516 --> 12:05.516
What?

12:05.600 --> 12:06.642
Come on.

12:07.310 --> 12:11.814
You don't think I know your repertoire
after thousands of years of marriage?

12:11.981 --> 12:13.482
(LAUGHS)

12:14.984 --> 12:16.527
It's okay. I'm not mad.

12:16.611 --> 12:18.237
You thought I was dead.

12:18.363 --> 12:20.406
Ellen.

12:20.490 --> 12:21.657
Who was it?

12:21.741 --> 12:23.325
Well, if you really...

12:28.748 --> 12:30.457
It was a Six.

12:31.459 --> 12:32.835
Caprica Six.

12:36.673 --> 12:38.048
We made the Sixes.

12:38.133 --> 12:39.633
We created her.
That's just...

12:39.717 --> 12:41.176
I thought of you.

12:42.303 --> 12:43.554
Always.

12:43.930 --> 12:44.930
I thought of you.

12:45.014 --> 12:46.515
What do you mean? When you...

12:46.850 --> 12:52.146
Oh! Please do not tell me
I was your mental porn.

12:52.230 --> 12:54.022
That's just sad.

12:56.484 --> 12:58.026
Well, are you
still seeing her?

Yes.

I would see this.

All those years.

14:13.019 --> 14:15.771
Oh! The poor boy.

14:16.814 --> 14:18.482
Such bad timing.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.407
NO. 6: We've been thinking.

14:28.243 --> 14:29.660
We belong together.

14:30.620 --> 14:32.162
Join us on the Baseship.

14:32.247 --> 14:34.706
We'll jump away.
Start a new life.

14:35.124 --> 14:38.752
Please consider the offer.
It would mean so much to us.

14:39.963 --> 14:42.714
Abandon the Fleet.
This is your offer?

14:43.132 --> 14:45.926
The priority of
the Fleet is the survival...

14:46.803 --> 14:48.720
The survival of humans.

14:48.805 --> 14:50.597
We're not safe in this Fleet.

14:51.099 --> 14:52.641
Even today,
a Cylon was assaulted.

14:52.725 --> 14:56.812
I agree. This is about the survival
of the original Thirteenth Tribe

14:56.896 --> 14:58.188
in its purest form.

14:58.273 --> 15:00.607
Did you put this
idea in their heads?

15:00.692 --> 15:02.442
It won't work, of course.

15:02.527 --> 15:05.737
The child, Hera, is the hope
for a new blended future.

15:05.822 --> 15:09.074
That used to be true.
But now there is another way.

15:09.325 --> 15:12.327
Caprica Six's unborn
baby is pure Cylon.

15:12.996 --> 15:15.831
We can rebuild
a pure Cylon civilization.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.916
NO. 6: Even if we don't find
a planet to colonize,

15:18.001 --> 15:20.752
we can live indefinitely
on the Baseship.

15:20.837 --> 15:24.047
Look at him.
He'd die over there.

15:24.966 --> 15:27.467
We can take care of
him better than here.

15:27.552 --> 15:32.180
The Cylon family can survive.
We can start over.

15:33.057 --> 15:36.810
Caprica Six is pregnant?

15:42.734 --> 15:43.900
ELLEN: You got her pregnant?

15:43.985 --> 15:46.361
TIGH: I did. Yeah.
I didn't know.

15:46.988 --> 15:48.071
I was surprised.

15:48.156 --> 15:50.532
It was a great surprise
to all of us.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.784
The mating of
an original Cylon.

15:52.869 --> 15:54.911
You are our children.

15:55.455 --> 15:59.374
Can we talk about the offer,
maybe deal with the baby later?

15:59.459 --> 16:00.584
Are we going or...

16:00.710 --> 16:02.377
Of course not. I can't
believe you got her pregnant.

16:02.462 --> 16:05.380
Anders specifically said,
"Do not abandon the Fleet. "

16:05.465 --> 16:06.673
So you love her then.
You really frakking...

16:06.758 --> 16:07.966
Last thing he ever said.

16:08.051 --> 16:10.636
What he said?
He's not saying anything now.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.220
TORY: I'm going
with the Baseship.

16:12.305 --> 16:13.430
Even after you knew...

16:13.514 --> 16:14.514
TIGH: For frak's sake.

16:14.599 --> 16:15.682
ELLEN: You made us all
filthy in this.

16:15.767 --> 16:18.060
You just can't stop
poisoning me.

16:18.144 --> 16:21.313
Poison, more and more of it
until I'm swimming in it!

16:21.397 --> 16:22.522
Please, stop this.

16:22.607 --> 16:23.690
I'm staying on Galactica.
You hear me?

16:23.775 --> 16:25.150
You can go if you're so mad.

16:25.234 --> 16:29.363
Wait. We won't leave with
just one or two of the five.

16:29.447 --> 16:32.157
It has to be all of
you or none of you.

16:32.241 --> 16:35.243
ATHENA: So you need to vote and
the outcome will bind all of you.

16:35.328 --> 16:39.247
Majority rule. It's what Cylons
do. It's a legacy from you.

16:39.791 --> 16:43.710
Fine. So it's a vote?
All right. I vote we go.

16:44.879 --> 16:46.797
TORY: Great.
That's me and you.

16:47.465 --> 16:49.591
And we don't really know
what Anders would vote.

16:49.676 --> 16:52.010
Yeah, we do.
He said he'd stay.

16:52.428 --> 16:55.514
All those years we tried to
have children and we never could.

16:55.598 --> 16:57.015
Ellen.
You must've been laughing

16:57.100 --> 16:59.393
your shiny, shiny head off.
No.

16:59.477 --> 17:00.727
It was impossible.

17:00.812 --> 17:02.312
You didn't love me.
Ellen.

17:02.397 --> 17:04.356
So what are you saying?

17:04.732 --> 17:06.942
Do you vote to stay or to go?

17:15.451 --> 17:17.202
I haven't decided yet.

17:17.286 --> 17:19.496
Ellen. Ellen!

17:21.124 --> 17:22.499
TIGH: Ellen.

17:22.583 --> 17:23.834
Two to go, two to stay,

17:23.918 --> 17:26.795
and the swing vote is
walking out the door.

17:31.175 --> 17:33.635
PAULLA: We come to Dogsville
more often now.

17:33.761 --> 17:38.223
Hey! We don't feel the need to cut
ourselves off from the rest of the world.

17:38.307 --> 17:41.351
We trade here. Sometimes, we
sell the jewelry that we made.

17:41.436 --> 17:43.687
I mean, that's how
we got so much food.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.147
Yes, Jeanne.

17:46.149 --> 17:49.234
Since you've been gone, we've been
trying to focus on life, you know?

17:49.318 --> 17:50.902
Gaius, come on.

17:53.489 --> 17:54.656
Gaius!

17:59.370 --> 18:00.704
Hello.

18:01.456 --> 18:02.831
What's your name?

18:03.207 --> 18:04.458
Naia.

18:04.542 --> 18:07.669
Naia.
That's a very beautiful name.

18:09.797 --> 18:10.922
And who's this?

18:11.007 --> 18:12.758
Stand up. Stand up.

18:14.177 --> 18:15.677
This is Gaius.

18:16.804 --> 18:17.846
(GASPS)

18:18.514 --> 18:20.515
Really? I'm very flattered...

18:20.600 --> 18:22.100
It was his father's name.

18:22.185 --> 18:24.561
...to have the same
name as his father.

18:24.645 --> 18:26.021
It's very...

18:29.942 --> 18:31.401
Are you hungry?

18:31.486 --> 18:33.528
Yeah. You look a bit hungry.

18:33.863 --> 18:35.322
He's hungry?

18:35.406 --> 18:37.449
NAIA: They're all hungry.
BALTAR: Are they?

18:38.701 --> 18:40.368
Paulla, we've got
some food, haven't we,

18:40.453 --> 18:43.246
to share with
this lot of people?

18:43.331 --> 18:46.666
Gaius, we're gonna need it
eventually, to eat, to trade.

18:46.751 --> 18:48.293
We can't.

18:49.837 --> 18:51.296
Really, Paulla?

18:52.173 --> 18:56.218
Are we going to enjoy this
food with children starving?

18:56.803 --> 18:59.179
Now, ask yourself
this question, really.

18:59.263 --> 19:00.388
Look around,
look at these...

19:00.473 --> 19:01.932
It's not just
this child here.

19:02.391 --> 19:05.060
This little Gaius.

19:05.812 --> 19:08.271
I mean... But he is
very cute, this one.

19:09.065 --> 19:12.108
Yeah. I mean, it's all the
children, isn't it? All of them.

19:12.193 --> 19:15.111
And you're putting the food...
Listen to me!

19:15.446 --> 19:16.822
Listen to me!

19:17.698 --> 19:19.491
I'm coming back here.

19:19.575 --> 19:21.868
And if it is
the last thing I do,

19:21.953 --> 19:25.664
I will ensure that every
single one of you are fed

19:25.748 --> 19:29.626
and your children are fed,
as God is my witness!

19:42.265 --> 19:43.515
Caprica.

19:45.059 --> 19:48.728
That's funny. I don't think I've
ever called you a name before.

19:49.814 --> 19:51.481
I think you probably
called me some names.

19:51.566 --> 19:52.566
(CHUCKLES)

19:53.025 --> 19:57.028
I haven't had the chance... Well,
no, I haven't taken the opportunity

19:57.113 --> 19:59.614
to congratulate you
on the baby.

19:59.699 --> 20:03.660
I just wondered if everything was
all right with Ellen being back.

20:04.787 --> 20:07.372
I heard about the assault
in Dogsville.

20:07.957 --> 20:11.585
And on behalf of the Fleet,
I wanted to apologize to you.

20:11.752 --> 20:12.836
Thank you.

20:13.421 --> 20:15.297
It's very kind of you.

20:16.132 --> 20:18.675
Caprica, sometimes I
think about the visions

20:18.759 --> 20:22.304
that we shared
and the talk we had.

20:23.931 --> 20:25.098
Yeah.

20:26.642 --> 20:29.102
I haven't had one in a while.
Have you?

20:29.186 --> 20:30.520
No.

20:30.605 --> 20:32.647
Not the whole time
I've been pregnant.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.774
That never occurred to me.

20:34.859 --> 20:36.818
Are you saying that this...

20:38.112 --> 20:39.237
What?

20:40.656 --> 20:42.824
Is this child important?

20:43.576 --> 20:45.869
Yes,
I think he's very important.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.246
He's my baby and I love him.

20:48.331 --> 20:49.664
He's very important to me.

20:49.749 --> 20:50.999
Of course he is.

20:51.667 --> 20:54.711
Of course, all children
are important. Yes, indeed.

20:55.463 --> 20:56.504
Hmm.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.965
Well, thank you
for asking about him.

20:59.050 --> 21:00.592
You're welcome.

21:05.139 --> 21:07.223
Hey, when'd you get a piano?

21:09.018 --> 21:10.101
Gin.

21:12.772 --> 21:15.857
You see Ellen and Tigh
on the wing of that bird?

21:16.025 --> 21:18.693
It's like watching
my parents make out.

21:23.824 --> 21:26.201
You go see Boomer
in the brig yet?

21:28.329 --> 21:29.329
No.

21:30.539 --> 21:32.624
You should go
when she's asleep.

21:32.708 --> 21:36.294
I watched Sam until I just
couldn't handle the fun anymore.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.657
There you are.

22:08.244 --> 22:09.703
Look at you.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.169
(SIGHS)

22:20.506 --> 22:22.507
ELLEN: You haven't
changed much.

22:23.134 --> 22:26.094
How did you get the guards
to bring you here?

22:32.435 --> 22:33.435
(CHUCKLES)

22:34.145 --> 22:35.937
I thought maybe we
could have a drink.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.856
Where's the booze?

22:37.940 --> 22:39.524
I have tea.

22:39.608 --> 22:40.817
God, no.

22:44.071 --> 22:46.364
Listen,
I wanted to talk to you.

22:46.949 --> 22:49.701
Things between me and Saul,

22:50.119 --> 22:52.370
it just gets so crazy.

22:52.455 --> 22:56.374
I step off that Raptor and,
boom, we're making love.

22:56.459 --> 23:00.962
And less than a day later,
I'm screaming at him.

23:01.547 --> 23:03.798
But we were always, always,

23:04.550 --> 23:06.176
always like that.

23:08.846 --> 23:10.472
Anyway, I just...

23:11.432 --> 23:13.308
I wanted to assure you.

23:16.771 --> 23:19.105
He didn't tell you
about the sex.

23:21.525 --> 23:22.734
Frak.

23:23.277 --> 23:24.694
I'm...

23:26.697 --> 23:29.282
I come here to try
to be good and...

23:29.992 --> 23:30.992
(SIGHS)

23:31.786 --> 23:32.952
Look.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.122
Don't worry.

23:36.457 --> 23:40.835
Seriously. Because you have all the
proof right there that he loves you.

23:42.630 --> 23:45.298
You know, when we were
still trying to have our own,

23:45.382 --> 23:48.009
he always brought
up the name "Liam. "

23:48.969 --> 23:49.969
(SIGHS)

23:50.346 --> 23:52.388
Pure Cylon baby.

23:54.058 --> 23:57.143
If Simon knew,
he'd want it so badly.

23:57.728 --> 23:59.979
I'll take care
of this child.

24:00.439 --> 24:02.690
That wasn't a threat,
Caprica.

24:04.151 --> 24:05.360
No.

24:06.695 --> 24:08.363
That was a threat.

24:12.743 --> 24:15.703
I don't know why you
couldn't have children, Ellen.

24:15.788 --> 24:19.374
Sometimes love must not be
enough, because he loved you.

24:22.545 --> 24:24.003
Yes, this...

24:25.714 --> 24:27.215
This is rough.

24:28.509 --> 24:30.051
But what can I do?

24:31.428 --> 24:34.305
If I make him choose
between you and me,

24:34.390 --> 24:37.725
I know the best that I could
do would be to tear him in half.

24:37.852 --> 24:39.060
Don't.

24:42.690 --> 24:43.898
I won't.

24:50.406 --> 24:53.491
You win. The man loves you.

24:54.869 --> 24:57.996
In fact, I'd say there
isn't much he loves more.

25:12.803 --> 25:15.054
Here you go, Gaius.
Here you go.

25:15.639 --> 25:17.724
Here you go.
Take that to mommy.

25:17.808 --> 25:19.350
Here you go. There you go.

25:19.435 --> 25:21.186
The marines tried
this already, Gaius,

25:21.270 --> 25:23.021
and people started
pushing and grabbing.

25:23.105 --> 25:25.398
The marines have assault
rifles, not handguns.

25:25.482 --> 25:27.859
Look around you, Paulla,
will you? Look around.

25:27.943 --> 25:30.653
Can you see anybody rioting?
Can you? No.

25:31.280 --> 25:32.363
There's no uniforms here.

25:32.448 --> 25:33.489
Come, come.

25:33.574 --> 25:36.451
There's no sense of
oppression. It's just...

25:36.660 --> 25:38.620
It's just one soul
touching another, isn't it?

25:38.704 --> 25:41.122
Hmm. Okay, well,
we need the food.

25:41.790 --> 25:45.877
Paulla, when you share your
food, God makes it tenfold.

25:45.961 --> 25:47.837
You watch me and you're
going to learn something.

25:47.922 --> 25:50.006
You're gonna want to
step away from those.

25:53.260 --> 25:54.427
Really?

25:55.304 --> 25:57.055
And who would you be?

25:57.389 --> 25:59.515
Step away from the supplies.

26:00.809 --> 26:03.811
Ladies,
show this man we are armed.

26:04.897 --> 26:05.980
Do it.

26:06.815 --> 26:08.900
Take it off the safety,
Jeanne.

26:10.319 --> 26:11.945
Ours are bigger.

26:30.673 --> 26:31.923
Careful.

26:36.011 --> 26:38.763
So the five of you
together at last.

26:39.848 --> 26:43.685
Any mythic revelations?

26:43.769 --> 26:46.688
Nope.
Nothing to report, sir.

26:51.235 --> 26:52.235
Hmm.

26:55.698 --> 26:57.282
You were born, right, Saul?

26:57.366 --> 26:58.366
What?

26:58.450 --> 26:59.993
You were born.

27:00.077 --> 27:02.036
TIGH: On Earth. Yeah.

27:02.121 --> 27:03.579
I don't remember.

27:03.706 --> 27:04.872
But...

27:05.374 --> 27:07.041
I wouldn't anyway.

27:07.876 --> 27:10.545
Nature of the process, right?

27:10.921 --> 27:12.588
(LAUGHING)

27:13.716 --> 27:15.258
ADAMA: Not very
machine-like of you.

27:15.342 --> 27:17.218
Great Grandpa
was a power sander.

27:17.344 --> 27:18.344
(LAUGHS)

27:18.846 --> 27:19.846
(LAUGHING)

27:28.647 --> 27:31.232
They're putting the stuff into her. Yes.

27:31.317 --> 27:33.526
The Cylon goop, you said.
Yeah.

27:33.610 --> 27:35.028
If it works,

27:35.904 --> 27:39.032
she'll still be the Galactica
on the outside, but...

27:42.619 --> 27:45.163
She won't know
what she is anymore.

27:51.587 --> 27:53.296
It'll save her.

27:53.380 --> 27:56.549
That along with
Cylons flying CAP.

27:59.261 --> 28:00.928
We need their help.

28:03.307 --> 28:04.599
We need your help.

28:04.767 --> 28:05.767
(CHUCKLES)

28:06.977 --> 28:08.853
Laura and Lee know it.

28:10.189 --> 28:12.231
They don't think I see it.

28:14.902 --> 28:16.027
But I do.

28:17.446 --> 28:18.613
I see it.

28:21.950 --> 28:24.535
You never told me that the Sons
of Aries were involved in this.

28:24.620 --> 28:26.621
Well, of course they are...
Did you think they would stay

28:26.705 --> 28:29.540
out of something as valuable
as food supplies?

28:29.625 --> 28:33.086
Well, you didn't want to be
king of the fools anymore.

28:37.341 --> 28:40.676
No, the only thing worse
than being leader of this lot

28:42.137 --> 28:44.055
would be being one of them.

28:44.139 --> 28:46.808
Did you really want
to feed those people?

28:54.691 --> 28:58.486
I enjoyed it, actually.
I did enjoy giving.

29:00.656 --> 29:03.825
I loved it, actually,
the more I did it.

29:08.163 --> 29:10.832
Done it long enough,
I'd have given them my heart.

29:12.209 --> 29:16.629
Well, do you think she's telling
them anything as moving as that?

29:16.713 --> 29:18.798
Do you think
she's giving them hope?

29:18.882 --> 29:20.550
She's not, is she?

29:25.431 --> 29:27.598
What's Paulla
been saying to you?

29:28.725 --> 29:32.019
Has Paulla been saying
that we mustn't help others?

29:33.439 --> 29:34.605
Because

29:35.983 --> 29:37.275
I disagree.

29:38.777 --> 29:44.532
Has Paulla been saying that we can't
help others because we're too weak?

29:45.951 --> 29:47.535
I disagree.

29:51.331 --> 29:52.707
Paulla.

29:54.793 --> 29:57.420
I am so disappointed
with you.

29:59.423 --> 30:01.883
I'm disappointed
with all of you.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.469
Here you all are.

30:04.636 --> 30:06.721
I'm gone for three minutes,

30:06.972 --> 30:10.683
and you're lapping up
Paulla's icy pragmatism.

30:12.436 --> 30:15.229
There is a way
to feed ourselves

30:15.314 --> 30:17.732
and the people
from Dogsville!

30:19.651 --> 30:21.777
There is a way to bring hope

30:22.404 --> 30:24.071
to the lower decks,

30:24.907 --> 30:26.199
to the whole
of this poor ship.

30:26.283 --> 30:27.909
There is a way to win!

30:29.203 --> 30:30.995
She thinks we can't
get what we need.

30:31.079 --> 30:34.499
She thinks we can't
get what we need!

30:34.583 --> 30:36.584
All we need is strength.

30:36.668 --> 30:38.961
All we need is strength!

30:39.588 --> 30:42.798
And strength
comes from within.

30:43.050 --> 30:45.176
We can get more guns.

30:45.260 --> 30:46.636
Better guns. Bigger guns.

30:46.720 --> 30:48.262
And guns!

30:48.347 --> 30:51.641
More guns.
Bigger guns. Better guns.

30:51.725 --> 30:54.352
And when we have those,
we will win!

30:54.436 --> 30:55.937
Yeah.
Yeah!

30:56.146 --> 30:57.438
(ALL CHEERING)

31:17.584 --> 31:20.211
Thanks for seeing me alone.
I just...

31:20.295 --> 31:21.879
I have to talk to you.

31:21.964 --> 31:23.089
Of course.

31:23.257 --> 31:24.465
Ellen...

31:24.841 --> 31:26.926
Hate me, I'll take it.

31:27.553 --> 31:29.220
But this is bigger than that.

31:29.304 --> 31:31.597
Galactica needs the Baseship.

31:36.144 --> 31:38.604
Why did you even
make love to me, Saul,

31:38.689 --> 31:40.982
when your real love
was at home?

31:41.233 --> 31:43.276
Did you even
hear what I said?

31:43.360 --> 31:45.987
Bill needs the Baseship.

31:46.071 --> 31:47.738
I heard you.

31:47.823 --> 31:49.490
Did you hear me?

31:50.742 --> 31:53.369
Her brush is
where mine used to be.

31:53.453 --> 31:55.204
My dresses are gone.

31:56.039 --> 31:57.748
She shares our bed.

31:57.833 --> 31:59.834
Do you remember,
I got us that mattress?

31:59.918 --> 32:01.877
You went to my quarters?

32:03.797 --> 32:04.797
Not interrupting?

32:04.881 --> 32:06.507
Not at all.
I was expecting you.

32:06.592 --> 32:08.134
You called him?

32:09.636 --> 32:11.262
Good. Come on in.

32:12.306 --> 32:13.806
You too, Caprica.

32:13.890 --> 32:15.641
TIGH: What is this?

32:15.851 --> 32:18.811
We're joining the Baseship.
All of us.

32:19.980 --> 32:21.981
We can jump away from the
Fleet whenever you're ready.

32:22.065 --> 32:23.149
Thank you.

32:23.275 --> 32:24.942
ELLEN: It's the right
decision. TIGH: No.

32:25.027 --> 32:26.360
No, it's not. No.

32:26.445 --> 32:31.490
The vote is you and Anders
versus me, Tory and Galen.

32:32.034 --> 32:35.119
Caprica, obviously, that
means you have to come, too.

32:35.203 --> 32:37.330
Wouldn't you like to raise
your child where it's safe?

32:37.414 --> 32:39.498
I want him to be safe, yes.

32:39.583 --> 32:42.460
She doesn't understand
what this means.

32:42.544 --> 32:45.588
I used to think Hera
was the only hope for us.

32:45.672 --> 32:47.965
But clearly that's
just not true anymore.

32:48.050 --> 32:49.133
TIGH: No.

32:50.010 --> 32:52.386
Her baby, he's pure Cylon.

32:52.804 --> 32:55.806
If we go off and make
some pure Cylon culture...

32:55.891 --> 32:59.268
That's what happened on Earth
and it led to disaster.

32:59.603 --> 33:01.145
Pure human doesn't work.

33:01.229 --> 33:03.731
Pure Cylon doesn't work.
It's too weak.

33:04.107 --> 33:06.942
You just don't want to leave
the one you really love.

33:07.027 --> 33:08.110
What?

33:08.695 --> 33:09.737
Talk to me. What is this?

33:09.821 --> 33:12.031
It's petty and vile.

33:12.115 --> 33:15.034
Enough. She's voted.
When's the jump?

33:15.410 --> 33:16.869
We can be ready in an hour.

33:16.953 --> 33:18.245
Well, I'm not going.

33:18.330 --> 33:19.705
We agreed on majority rule.

33:19.790 --> 33:22.667
(SCOFFS) Well, frak, apparently,
we invented majority rule.

33:22.751 --> 33:25.211
But I don't remember it,
so frak that.

33:25.796 --> 33:27.922
Saul, don't let her...

33:29.800 --> 33:34.261
All right, go. Go.
All of you. Caprica. Go.

33:35.305 --> 33:39.350
Go be pure and safe and
whatever the frak. I'm not going.

33:39.434 --> 33:41.352
Do you see, little girl?

33:42.229 --> 33:48.359
There is something in the universe
that he loves far more than you or me.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.320
And that's Bill Adama.

33:51.405 --> 33:53.447
You don't even want to go.

33:54.199 --> 33:55.700
This is all to hurt me.

33:55.784 --> 33:57.910
Bill Adama,
and the ship

33:57.994 --> 33:59.829
and the uniform.
How can you sink so low?

33:59.913 --> 34:01.122
And everything else
takes second place.

34:01.206 --> 34:02.373
Why are you doing this?

34:02.457 --> 34:06.293
I knew I did. But I always
wondered if a baby would.

34:09.005 --> 34:10.756
Guess I know now.

34:12.384 --> 34:13.384
(GROANS)

34:14.261 --> 34:15.344
Come here.

34:15.429 --> 34:17.096
NO. 6: Something's wrong.
Something's really wrong.

34:17.180 --> 34:19.473
Get Cottle. Get Cottle. Get Cottle.

34:19.558 --> 34:21.183
TIGH: Got to get her to...

34:21.268 --> 34:22.643
ATHENA: You'll be okay.

34:25.814 --> 34:28.899
Never seen anyone get into trouble
so fast, but he's fighting back.

34:28.984 --> 34:30.151
That's all I can tell you.

34:30.235 --> 34:31.235
I didn't mean this.

34:31.319 --> 34:32.278
Yeah, you did.

34:32.362 --> 34:34.405
COTTLE: Here, this may help
increase his heart rate.

34:34.489 --> 34:35.573
No.

34:35.657 --> 34:37.116
You knew how I would
have to choose.

34:37.200 --> 34:38.451
You knew what it meant.

34:38.535 --> 34:39.869
I'm sorry.

34:40.370 --> 34:43.622
Of course, Cylons and humans
need to stay together.

34:43.707 --> 34:45.833
But I always intended...
I just...

34:45.917 --> 34:47.418
I didn't think.

34:47.502 --> 34:51.088
Saul, I only wanted
to hurt you, not her.

34:51.173 --> 34:54.592
You didn't think I would
hurt her if I let her go?

34:54.676 --> 34:55.801
It never occurred to you?

34:55.886 --> 34:56.927
No.
No wonder

34:57.012 --> 35:00.055
we had to invent some compassionate
God for them to believe in.

35:00.140 --> 35:02.349
We couldn't have
them deify us, could we?

35:02.434 --> 35:03.809
We didn't invent anything.

35:03.894 --> 35:05.269
Shut up. Just stop!

35:06.855 --> 35:09.690
I'm so sorry.
Maybe

35:11.860 --> 35:13.611
I just shouldn't be here.

35:13.695 --> 35:16.238
First intelligent
thing you've said.

35:21.536 --> 35:23.120
(NO. 6 GROANING)

35:49.189 --> 35:52.107
Talk to her.
Tell her you love her.

35:53.235 --> 35:54.652
It's what she needs.

35:55.570 --> 35:57.238
It's what the baby needs.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.418
Caprica, listen.

36:12.921 --> 36:15.589
I love you, all right?

36:17.425 --> 36:19.093
Can you hear me?

36:22.264 --> 36:23.848
This is nonsense.
Saul...

36:23.932 --> 36:25.182
She knows it.

36:25.267 --> 36:26.517
I don't need to say it.

36:26.601 --> 36:28.185
I shouldn't need
to say it to anyone.

36:28.270 --> 36:29.812
Isn't it enough
that I feel it?

36:29.896 --> 36:31.689
Just tell her.
I feel it!

36:32.649 --> 36:34.984
For her. For you. For Liam.

36:37.112 --> 36:39.196
I shouldn't need
to spout the words.

36:39.281 --> 36:41.407
I feel it less with words.

36:43.368 --> 36:49.248
Just let me Godsdamn feel it
and I'll fill the frakking room.

36:51.459 --> 36:52.668
(SIGHS)

37:04.639 --> 37:07.892
COTTLE: His heart rate is dropping.
I got signs of distress all over.

37:07.976 --> 37:09.351
Doesn't look good.

37:09.436 --> 37:11.061
I am so sorry.

37:13.148 --> 37:15.858
Cut him out.
Even if it kills me.

37:15.942 --> 37:17.943
He'll live if you cut
him out right now.

37:18.028 --> 37:20.446
Cylon babies must
be strong, right?

37:20.530 --> 37:21.530
(CRYING)

37:22.532 --> 37:24.742
Hera was born early.
Cut him out.

37:24.826 --> 37:26.327
I am not cutting you.
Forget it.

37:26.411 --> 37:28.579
He'll never make it.
Four months? No.

37:28.663 --> 37:29.872
Please.

37:32.417 --> 37:34.543
Caprica, listen,

37:35.503 --> 37:37.212
I have to tell you.

37:37.797 --> 37:40.507
He loves you more
than he ever loved me.

37:40.675 --> 37:43.552
You are the mother
of his son.

37:44.262 --> 37:47.473
The boy is alive. I can see
his heartbeat on the monitor.

37:47.557 --> 37:50.392
And that's proof,
proof he loves you.

37:51.186 --> 37:52.853
He loves you so much.

37:53.605 --> 37:55.564
It's shining out of him.

37:55.815 --> 37:58.525
You and he can
stay on Galactica.

37:59.277 --> 38:01.320
I'll go away with the others.

38:01.404 --> 38:05.032
And you can be together,
a little family.

38:05.116 --> 38:06.533
I promise it.

38:08.870 --> 38:11.038
COTTLE: That's it. I'm sorry.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.085
No!

38:16.419 --> 38:18.045
No, that was me.

38:18.380 --> 38:20.464
That was me.
I take it back. I'm sorry.

38:20.590 --> 38:22.508
The lady and I have some
work to do here now. TIGH: No!

38:22.592 --> 38:23.842
It's time for you to leave.

38:23.927 --> 38:25.469
You have to go now. Nurse!

38:25.553 --> 38:26.887
No.
Nurse.

38:26.972 --> 38:28.889
No. Out now.

38:30.725 --> 38:33.185
Saul. She's in good hands.

38:33.561 --> 38:35.104
(SOBBING)

38:45.365 --> 38:48.325
The two of you can stay here
and listen to this.

38:48.410 --> 38:51.161
Where are you going?
I'm gonna go to the head.

38:51.246 --> 38:53.664
Do something constructive. A
little project I've been working on.

38:53.748 --> 38:55.499
Listen to me, Admiral.

38:55.583 --> 38:56.917
Just wait.

39:00.046 --> 39:01.797
Explain what you mean.

39:06.344 --> 39:09.555
What you have right now
is starving civilians

39:09.639 --> 39:12.516
with no representation,
no recourse.

39:14.728 --> 39:17.479
They're broken.
They're exhausted.

39:17.564 --> 39:18.772
They've had enough.

39:18.857 --> 39:20.941
That's not a mutiny,
Admiral.

39:21.026 --> 39:22.026
That is a revolution.

39:22.110 --> 39:23.277
APOLLO: And you think you
can maintain order?

39:23.361 --> 39:25.988
Listen to me.
Listen. Please, Admiral!

39:27.574 --> 39:31.160
Galactica is slipping away
from you drop by drop.

39:31.244 --> 39:34.538
You are pouring Cylon
blood into her veins.

39:34.622 --> 39:37.541
I see the Cylon pilots.
We all see them.

39:39.127 --> 39:41.295
We all see
the Cylon workforce.

39:42.005 --> 39:44.923
Where are they going into
the far recesses of the ship?

39:45.008 --> 39:46.967
When are you inviting
the Centurions over

39:47.135 --> 39:49.053
to join in all the fun
we're having over here?

39:49.137 --> 39:51.221
Of course, when you do that,

39:52.015 --> 39:55.476
that very moment,
this becomes a blended ship,

39:55.977 --> 39:57.936
only half human.

40:00.023 --> 40:03.067
And right now, I am here
to tell you, your people...

40:04.819 --> 40:07.279
Your people are
not ready for that.

40:09.491 --> 40:11.200
Listen to me, Admiral.

40:11.284 --> 40:16.955
I am offering you the last human
solution you will ever be presented with.

40:29.844 --> 40:31.720
Well, Gaius, you did it.

40:32.514 --> 40:34.723
I don't know how,
but you did.

40:35.016 --> 40:37.267
I told you, Paulla.
I told you.

40:37.352 --> 40:40.062
You do good deeds
and you are rewarded.

40:40.939 --> 40:44.358
You're rewarded tenfold.
And then if you give,

40:45.026 --> 40:47.111
then you receive, don't you?

40:47.779 --> 40:49.488
That was beautiful.

40:49.864 --> 40:51.031
Yeah.

41:35.577 --> 41:36.577
(CRYING)

41:36.661 --> 41:37.995
I'm sorry.

41:42.917 --> 41:44.084
Liam.

41:45.044 --> 41:46.712
His name was Liam.

41:48.965 --> 41:50.591
It's a good name.

41:50.925 --> 41:52.885
Short for William.
Yeah.

41:53.469 --> 41:56.638
It's not like Zak.
I know. I know it's not.

41:58.099 --> 41:59.349
I know.

41:59.809 --> 42:00.976
It's okay.

42:01.477 --> 42:02.811
It's okay.

42:05.940 --> 42:07.107
It's okay.

42:46.314 --> 42:50.651
ROSLIN: These are the Cylons that
have died with us since the alliance.

42:51.486 --> 42:54.404
I didn't know
they were doing that. Did you?

It's already happened, hasn't it? Hmm.
