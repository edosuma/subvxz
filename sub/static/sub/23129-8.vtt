00:02.330 --> 00:03.729
- (Sally): Previously:

00:03.770 --> 00:05.329
The house! The '70s!

00:05.370 --> 00:07.168
- (Donna):
You were time travelling?

00:07.200 --> 00:08.634
Every time you use our magic,

00:08.670 --> 00:10.160
you run the risk

00:10.210 --> 00:12.599
of being trapped
in the past forever.

00:12.640 --> 00:14.677
- I'm stuck here!
I'm never going homel!

00:16.550 --> 00:19.372
Oh my God!
- Dammit!

00:19.420 --> 00:21.616
- This is
the night I die!

00:24.350 --> 00:26.352
He's gonna kill you!

00:27.560 --> 00:29.654
- I lost my
engagement ring.

00:29.690 --> 00:32.523
It fell.
- What?

00:32.560 --> 00:35.052
- It was right here,
and I was washing my hands,

00:35.100 --> 00:36.397
and it slipped
down the drain.

00:36.430 --> 00:38.762
- Wait, why did you
take it off?

00:39.800 --> 00:41.393
- Tell him you took it off

00:41.440 --> 00:44.102
because it reminds you
of how he makes you feel.

00:44.140 --> 00:46.609
Like garbage!
- I didn't want it to fall off.

00:46.640 --> 00:48.369
- You never said
it was loose.

00:48.410 --> 00:50.378
- I just thought that...

00:50.410 --> 00:52.276
Danny, come on!

00:52.320 --> 00:53.674
Can you just...
- No, no, no!

00:53.720 --> 00:56.417
It obviously doesn't
mean anything to you.

00:56.450 --> 00:58.339
No, no, no!
If it's even in there!

00:58.390 --> 01:01.155
God, I'm starting to
feel like a real idiot here.

01:01.190 --> 01:02.658
- Defend yourself!

01:02.690 --> 01:04.522
- I'm sorry.
- DEFEND YOURSELF!

01:04.560 --> 01:05.823
He's gonna kill you!

01:05.860 --> 01:07.225
- Danny, come on!

01:07.260 --> 01:08.819
- When else do you
take it off?

01:08.860 --> 01:10.362
When you go out
with friends?

01:10.400 --> 01:11.492
- Of course not!

01:11.530 --> 01:13.089
- I can change this.

01:13.140 --> 01:15.268
- Maybe you left it
in some guy's bed--

01:15.300 --> 01:18.167
- Right there!
Right there!

01:18.210 --> 01:20.372
Who talks to somebody
they love like that?

01:20.410 --> 01:22.799
I should've never
said yes to you, Danny.

01:22.850 --> 01:25.547
I should've never
said yes to any of this.

01:25.580 --> 01:27.776
- What the hell's
gotten into you?

01:27.820 --> 01:31.688
- Oh my God!
I finally feel like myself!

01:31.720 --> 01:33.859
I'm leaving you, Danny.
- Listen to me!

01:33.890 --> 01:35.380
- Oh, no, no, no.

01:35.420 --> 01:38.720
_ I don't have to
listen to you, ever again.

01:40.230 --> 01:41.550
We're done.

01:49.370 --> 01:51.407
- You don't talk
to me like that.

01:51.440 --> 01:53.204
(Groans)

01:53.240 --> 01:54.332
Oh!

01:56.180 --> 01:57.409
You bitch!

01:57.450 --> 01:59.714
(Grunts)

01:59.750 --> 02:02.788
(Exhales sharply)

02:05.450 --> 02:08.181
- Call a plumber if you want
your ring back!

02:11.460 --> 02:14.225
(Horns honking,
sirens wailing in distance)

02:14.260 --> 02:16.194
(Woman coughing)

02:17.800 --> 02:20.235
- I can't take
this place anymore.

02:20.270 --> 02:22.238
I'm asking that nurse
what the holdup is.

02:22.270 --> 02:24.238
- (Sally): No, Bridge,
do not talk to her.

02:24.270 --> 02:26.739
You know what? I'm actually OK.
I think we should go.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.373
- "Fine"?
- Yes!

02:28.410 --> 02:30.447
- You punched Danny
in the face.

02:30.480 --> 02:31.879
You tell me to
drive to Back Bay

02:31.910 --> 02:33.514
"cause you don't
wanna come here.

02:33.550 --> 02:35.712
<i>- You tell the doctor to
incinerate your sweater,.</i>

02:35.750 --> 02:37.912
What's going on?
- You cherry picked that list!

02:37.950 --> 02:40.487
I did normal things
between all the weird things.

02:40.520 --> 02:42.727
I just really can't
be here right now, please.

02:42.760 --> 02:45.229
_ - You're hurt!
- Bridget, you don't understand.

02:45.260 --> 02:48.355
Who knows what domino effect
I could've set into motion

02:48.400 --> 02:49.868
even by just
walking in here.

02:49.900 --> 02:52.540
- OK, I'm asking what
the holdup is. Sit down.

02:52.570 --> 02:55.232
Sit down.

02:58.640 --> 02:59.801
Sorry to bother you.

02:59.840 --> 03:01.501
Could you just take 2 seconds

03:01.540 --> 03:03.269
and come see my friend?

03:03.310 --> 03:05.540
I think she broke her wrist.
- Um, sure.

03:05.580 --> 03:07.241
Hi there. Can I take a look?

03:07.280 --> 03:08.816
- No, it's OK.
I know you're busy.

03:08.850 --> 03:11.285
You should just go
and forget I was ever here.

03:11.320 --> 03:14.255
- It looks like
it could be fractured, so--

03:14.290 --> 03:16.679
- Oh my God! Bangs!

03:16.730 --> 03:19.620
(Stammering):
It's good on your face.

03:19.660 --> 03:23.392
- Um, when she hurt her wrist,
did she hit her head as well?

03:23.430 --> 03:25.398
- Good question.
- I'm OK.

03:25.430 --> 03:27.831
- If she complains about
a headache or nausea,

03:27.870 --> 03:29.565
come find me
or another nurse.

03:29.610 --> 03:31.237
I'll send over
a wrist brace.

03:31.270 --> 03:32.476
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

03:35.580 --> 03:37.776
- You'd tell me if
you were feeling depressed

03:37.810 --> 03:39.949
or dementia-ey, right?

03:39.980 --> 03:42.244
- Yes! I feel awesome.,
I'm dynamite.

03:42.290 --> 03:44.543
I just wanna get
the hell out of here. Please.

03:44.590 --> 03:46.718
- Excuse me, miss?
Let's have a look.

03:53.960 --> 03:57.669
OK, can you bend it back?
- I think so. Yeah.

03:57.700 --> 03:59.998
- OK, does it hurt
when I flex it back like this?

04:00.040 --> 04:02.407
- It's good. It's OK.
- OK.

04:02.440 --> 04:03.566
Anything?

04:03.610 --> 04:05.465
(Laughing)

04:05.510 --> 04:10.004
Well, I think you're going to
live, Miss Maleek.

04:10.050 --> 04:12.542
- Malik.
- Malik, OK.

04:12.580 --> 04:15.015
What I need you to do,
Miss Malik,

04:15.050 --> 04:18.350
is wear this for 2 weeks...

04:18.390 --> 04:19.584
(Giggling)

04:19.620 --> 04:20.985
...don't lift anything heavy,

04:21.019 --> 04:23.682
and if you have questions,

04:23.730 --> 04:25.357
call and ask for me.

04:25.390 --> 04:26.653
I'm Aidan.

04:32.670 --> 04:35.867
- Something you need to ask him?
- No.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.709
No. Now's not the right time.

04:40.740 --> 04:42.777
- I don't understand
why you'd buy out Danny

04:42.810 --> 04:45.370
if you're not gonna
do anything with the house.

04:45.410 --> 04:48.345
I thought we were
gonna paint today.

04:49.620 --> 04:51.918
- Yeah, I decided against it.

04:51.950 --> 04:55.386
I think I really just wanna keep
the original charm of the place.

04:55.420 --> 04:58.060
I feel like it's gonna appeal
to some very specific renters.

04:58.090 --> 04:59.524
Don't worry.
I have a plan.

04:59.560 --> 05:00.925
- Do you?

05:00.960 --> 05:02.792
Or are you just stalling?

05:04.970 --> 05:06.734
- What are you...
- I'm sorry.

05:06.770 --> 05:09.034
It feels like you're
holding on to something.

05:10.840 --> 05:13.605
You and Danny broke up,
like, 6 months ago.

05:13.640 --> 05:16.405
- This has, like,
nothing to do with Danny.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.873
- Great, so let's just

05:18.910 --> 05:20.514
slap a coat of paint
on the place

05:20.550 --> 05:21.949
and get out of here,

05:21.980 --> 05:24.779
'cause I really think that
you need to move on, Sally.

05:24.820 --> 05:29.087
- Bridge, why do you care
so much about moving on?

05:30.130 --> 05:31.825
- Because I'm dating Danny.

05:34.530 --> 05:36.055
I'm dating Danny.

05:37.100 --> 05:39.432
- Bridget, as a friend,

05:39.470 --> 05:43.429
I can tell you that that's
a really, really bad idea.

05:43.470 --> 05:46.030
- You guys broke up
6 months ago.

05:46.070 --> 05:47.902
- He is abusive.

05:47.940 --> 05:49.442
- You kneed him in the balls

05:49.480 --> 05:50.970
and punched him in the face.

05:51.010 --> 05:52.444
- That's not what happened!

05:52.480 --> 05:53.914
That's not all that happened!

05:53.950 --> 05:55.816
He was gonna kill me.

06:00.590 --> 06:03.855
- Look, I wanna be here
for you as a friend,

06:03.890 --> 06:05.824
but you're making it
really difficult.

06:11.770 --> 06:13.693
(Indistinct)

06:21.110 --> 06:23.408
- Are you ready
to move in together?

06:23.450 --> 06:25.703
Oh yeah!

06:25.750 --> 06:28.879
He's funny,
isn't he, Aidan? Yeah.

06:28.920 --> 06:31.844
Feel the brotherly love!

06:32.920 --> 06:36.720
Oh, playful nudge! What?

06:41.000 --> 06:42.490
- Hi.
- Hey!

06:47.470 --> 06:49.507
- Hey, it's me.

06:49.540 --> 06:51.599
I need your help.

07:09.160 --> 07:11.788
- (Aidan, laughing):
The look on Mr. Weidner's face.

07:11.830 --> 07:13.150
Utter relief.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.919
Release and then,
ah, ecstasy.

07:15.960 --> 07:18.167
- I didn't know
you were this funny.

07:18.200 --> 07:21.500
I see you in the break room,
and you're all dark clouds

07:21.540 --> 07:22.666
and faraway thoughts.

07:22.710 --> 07:23.905
- That's my hook.

07:23.940 --> 07:25.203
- Just so you know,

07:25.240 --> 07:28.631
the whole Byronic-hero thing
doesn't really work on me.

07:28.680 --> 07:29.909
- "Bionic hero"?

07:29.950 --> 07:31.770
<i>I Y-B Byron?
yron-- Oh!</i>

07:33.220 --> 07:35.075
That doesn't work on you?
- Sadly, no.

07:35.120 --> 07:37.088
No, I'm a nice girl
with a bright future.

07:39.660 --> 07:42.015
- I can see that.

07:42.060 --> 07:43.482
- Aidan Waite.

07:43.530 --> 07:45.680
I just wanted to come over

07:45.730 --> 07:48.051
and thank you so much
for never calling me back.

07:48.100 --> 07:51.923
Also, for giving me
raging genital warts.

07:51.970 --> 07:53.665
Have a good night!

07:57.870 --> 07:59.577
- She's lying!

07:59.610 --> 08:00.839
- Right.

08:00.880 --> 08:02.575
Thanks for the drinks.
- Rebecca--

08:02.610 --> 08:04.169
- I'm just gonna
call it a night.

08:04.210 --> 08:05.939
- Hold on for
a second. Hold--

08:09.750 --> 08:11.548
(Chuckles)

08:17.690 --> 08:19.920
- You'll thank me
for that some day.

08:19.960 --> 08:20.995
(Sighs)

08:21.030 --> 08:22.828
Would you just
let me explain?

08:22.870 --> 08:23.996
- I'm listening.

08:24.030 --> 08:25.794
- OK, where do I start?

08:25.830 --> 08:29.232
Um, first of all,
I'm from the future.

08:29.270 --> 08:30.806
- Oh...

08:30.840 --> 08:33.730
- Just wait! I came to stop you
from drinking Rebecca.

08:33.780 --> 08:36.875
Yeah, don't pretend you weren't
staring at her carotid artery

08:36.909 --> 08:39.207
like you were
just staring at mine.

08:39.250 --> 08:42.743
Aidan, I know
how hard you've worked

08:42.789 --> 08:44.542
to stay on bagged blood.

08:44.590 --> 08:46.285
Rebecca was
way too much temptation.

08:46.320 --> 08:47.549
If I hadn't shown up,

08:47.590 --> 08:49.627
she would've been
a crumpled Capri Sun,

08:49.660 --> 08:51.879
and you'd be calling
Bishop for a cleanup.

08:51.930 --> 08:53.750
- You're working for Bishop.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.097
OK, little girl,

08:55.130 --> 08:57.269
you have no idea
who you're dealing with.

08:57.300 --> 09:00.634
- Aidan, I'm not
working for anyone.

09:03.810 --> 09:05.266
I know Henry.

09:05.310 --> 09:06.971
I know Suren.

09:07.010 --> 09:09.308
You've told me about
Celine, your son, Isaac--

09:09.340 --> 09:11.047
- OK, stop!

09:11.080 --> 09:13.913
- I know all this
because I know you.

09:13.950 --> 09:16.885
We live together
for years in the future.

09:18.020 --> 09:20.318
I'm Sally. Hi.

09:20.360 --> 09:24.126
Look, I got thrown
back in time because--

09:24.160 --> 09:25.753
It's--it's a long story.

09:25.790 --> 09:27.792
It involves things
that you're not a fan of,

09:27.830 --> 09:29.195
like witches and blood magic.

09:29.230 --> 09:31.619
- I don't want
anything to do that.

09:31.670 --> 09:35.061
- I know how Bishop gets
his claws back into you.

09:35.100 --> 09:37.762
- Tell Bishop that I am
never going back to him.

09:37.810 --> 09:39.039
- I don't want you to.

09:39.070 --> 09:40.902
But you're headed
down that road.

09:40.940 --> 09:43.204
Why else would you
go on a date tonight?

09:43.250 --> 09:45.673
You're not ready.
You don't trust yourself.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.872
You're starting to slip.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.217
Just a little.

09:49.250 --> 09:50.843
But it's enough.

09:52.190 --> 09:54.579
How great would it be
if you could just stop it?

10:03.430 --> 10:04.989
- Yeah...

10:05.030 --> 10:07.089
- There's an original
prewar fireplace.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.289
- Doesn't surprise me.

10:08.340 --> 10:10.661
I can't find a single
downside to this place.

10:10.710 --> 10:12.269
I'm afraid to ask.
What's the rent?

10:12.310 --> 10:14.108
- Uh, well,

10:14.140 --> 10:16.802
I would really hate
to leave this place vacant,

10:16.850 --> 10:18.807
and you two seem like
such nice boys,

10:18.850 --> 10:21.239
so for you,

10:21.280 --> 10:23.715
I would say $800.

10:25.090 --> 10:27.115
Gonna let that stew.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.049
I'm gonna step over here.

10:32.930 --> 10:35.058
- OK, well...

10:35.100 --> 10:37.023
she's mentally ill,
or she's slow.

10:37.070 --> 10:39.425
Either way, it's sad,
"cause she's pretty.

10:39.470 --> 10:42.030
We need to rent
this place, man, OK?

10:42.070 --> 10:44.937
Someone else is gonna
come in here and snatch it up!

10:44.970 --> 10:46.972
We gotta do it!
- Yeah. I completely agree.

10:47.010 --> 10:49.274
- Really?
This is great, dude!

10:49.310 --> 10:50.869
- Sorry to interrupt.

10:50.910 --> 10:53.845
There is one more thing
that you should know about.

10:53.880 --> 10:55.712
You would have a 3rd roommate.

10:55.750 --> 10:57.047
I also live here.

10:57.090 --> 10:58.717
(Laughing)

10:58.750 --> 11:00.957
I'll let you two
talk it over.

11:04.490 --> 11:07.096
- OK, let me explain.
- No, I'm gonna talk first.

11:07.130 --> 11:08.450
You knew about this?

11:08.500 --> 11:10.992
We can't live with her.
We can't live with a human!

11:11.030 --> 11:12.930
I might scratch her.
You might eat her.

11:12.970 --> 11:15.291
We're the worst roommates ever.
- Listen to me.

11:15.340 --> 11:17.069
We don't have to
hide what we are.

11:17.110 --> 11:19.772
Sally is like us.

11:20.810 --> 11:22.107
- Ish...

11:24.350 --> 11:26.478
It would be
a lot easier to explain

11:26.510 --> 11:29.275
if I could unpossess myself,
but unfortunately, I can't,

11:29.320 --> 11:31.846
because as it turns out,
somewhere along the line,

11:31.890 --> 11:33.813
my past soul fused with
my future soul.

11:33.860 --> 11:36.249
Also, I can't do magic
when I'm untethered in time.

11:36.290 --> 11:38.486
So, pretty much
what's going on:

11:38.530 --> 11:40.157
I'm here, stuck with you guys,

11:40.200 --> 11:42.453
with all the knowledge
of what happens to us.

11:42.500 --> 11:45.128
What happened to us.

11:45.170 --> 11:46.797
Original us.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.330
- Did you give her my journal?

11:48.370 --> 11:50.259
You gave her my journal.
- Your journal?

11:50.310 --> 11:52.836
- Look, Josh,
we're friends.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.076
In the future, you guys
move into this house,

11:55.110 --> 11:56.748
only I'm a ghost.

11:56.780 --> 11:58.043
(Laughing)

11:58.080 --> 11:59.741
- She's a ghost
in the future.

11:59.780 --> 12:01.373
- Look, the whole ghost thing,

12:01.420 --> 12:02.444
it's actually real.

12:02.480 --> 12:04.289
- Look, Josh,

12:04.320 --> 12:05.913
I've done everything right.

12:05.950 --> 12:07.486
I wanna make things
better for us.

12:07.520 --> 12:10.182
Honestly, it's already
paying off. I'm alive!

12:10.230 --> 12:13.825
- And she saved Rebecca's life
too. I almost ate her.

12:13.860 --> 12:15.794
- I meant to ask you
how that date went.

12:15.830 --> 12:18.265
- It was OK.
Um, think about this.

12:18.300 --> 12:21.190
Yesterday, you were
completely into the idea

12:21.240 --> 12:23.459
of us moving in together
and helping each other.

12:23.510 --> 12:27.071
- The only difference is,
instead of 2 monsters, three!

12:27.110 --> 12:30.000
- So, look, a minute ago,
you loved this place.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.269
If anything,
you should love it even more.

12:32.310 --> 12:34.347
It comes with
its own guardian angel.

12:36.920 --> 12:39.241
And look at the
beautiful crown moulding.

12:39.290 --> 12:41.110
- Don't start with
the crown moulding!

12:41.160 --> 12:44.084
You know it's my weakness.
That's ugly.

12:44.130 --> 12:45.279
(Laughing)

12:45.330 --> 12:47.355
- Don't laugh.

12:53.170 --> 12:57.129
(* Oisin, my Bastard Brother
by the High Dials *)

12:59.240 --> 13:02.369
** Out hunting
on a beach at dawn *

13:02.410 --> 13:06.040
* Your arrow struck
a magic fawn *

13:06.080 --> 13:08.447
* Wonder and surprise

13:08.480 --> 13:11.245
* When it changed
before your eyes *

13:11.290 --> 13:15.488
* Her shipwreck eyes,
your deep-sea gaze *

13:15.520 --> 13:18.160
* Stirred up desire,
churned up the waves *

13:18.190 --> 13:21.160
* White horses,
foaming steeds *

13:21.200 --> 13:24.864
* Brought you down
through the deep *

13:24.900 --> 13:28.063
* Qisin, my bastard brother

13:28.100 --> 13:31.559
* It's not too late,
let's have another **

13:33.080 --> 13:34.605
- So, just out of curiosity,

13:34.640 --> 13:37.371
what were we paying
for rent in the future?

13:37.410 --> 13:41.347
- $750... but you were getting
a deal. I was murdered here.

13:41.380 --> 13:43.109
- So, this isolation room,

13:43.150 --> 13:46.085
if that's what we're calling it,
worst idea ever, right?

13:46.120 --> 13:48.088
- You're stressing
over the change.

13:48.120 --> 13:50.452
But let me tell you,
that basement, it's solid.

13:50.490 --> 13:52.857
- OK, yeah.
I am stressing about it.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.925
- There are other ways
you can do it.

13:54.960 --> 13:57.998
- Sally, we have to think
through the changes we make.

13:58.030 --> 14:00.431
Just giving him
the false confidence

14:00.470 --> 14:04.008
that something will work in the
future could make it fail now.

14:04.040 --> 14:05.963
It's like that
Ashton Kutcher...

14:06.010 --> 14:07.637
- The Butterfly Effect.
- (Aidan): Yes!

14:07.680 --> 14:11.048
- The change bag is safe.
I've already thought it through.

14:11.080 --> 14:12.548
- Change bag?
Like, a coin purse?

14:12.580 --> 14:14.048
- No, it's a duffel bag.

14:14.080 --> 14:17.015
So, change of clothes
for the morning,

14:17.050 --> 14:20.554
a sandwich, water,
hydrogen peroxide,

14:20.590 --> 14:25.130
burner phone for emergencies,
and the rump roast.

14:25.160 --> 14:26.650
- The wh--

14:26.690 --> 14:29.455
- Take a piece of meat,
run it around in circles.

14:29.500 --> 14:32.060
The wolf just chases it
all night, away from people.

14:33.100 --> 14:34.966
Boom shaka-laka!

14:36.000 --> 14:37.502
- (Josh): Hydrogen peroxide,

14:37.540 --> 14:39.030
is that for
cuts and scrapes?

14:39.070 --> 14:41.471
"Cause any cuts
I endure as a wolf

14:41.510 --> 14:43.342
just disappear
when I change back.

14:43.380 --> 14:45.542
- No, it's for the morning.
For your breath.

14:45.580 --> 14:47.674
Your wolf
definitely eats poop.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.212
- That's insane!

14:50.250 --> 14:51.649
That's in--

14:51.690 --> 14:54.682
My wolf doesn't
eat poop, OK?

14:54.720 --> 14:56.154
I wouldn't do that.

14:56.190 --> 14:57.658
OK? He wouldn't do it.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.059
- I'm--I'm glad that
you brought that up.

15:06.100 --> 15:08.262
- Defensive!

15:08.300 --> 15:10.200
(Birds calling)

15:36.430 --> 15:38.159
- I was hunting.

15:39.400 --> 15:41.289
- Where'd you learn
my rump roast trick?

15:44.040 --> 15:46.463
- (Sally):
Danny Angeli is a murderer!

15:46.510 --> 15:47.978
- Oh no!

15:48.010 --> 15:50.001
- He's a murderer!

15:50.050 --> 15:51.643
- Should we--
- I got this.

15:51.680 --> 15:54.411
Hey, is everything OK, officer?

15:54.450 --> 15:57.044
- Your friend here,
she's a little hysterical.

15:57.090 --> 15:59.718
- Yes, um, I really
shouldn't have left her alone.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.718
See, I'm her nurse.

16:04.360 --> 16:06.681
- Do not go to
that memorial service.

16:06.730 --> 16:10.223
Another scene like today
and I'll be forced to book you.

16:10.270 --> 16:14.059
She's lucky we're not
taking her in tonight.

16:14.100 --> 16:16.159
You can't just
accuse people of murder.

16:16.200 --> 16:18.567
- I know. I know. She doesn't
know what she's saying.

16:18.610 --> 16:20.704
I'm really sorry for
the trouble, officers.

16:20.740 --> 16:22.674
Thank you for your time.

16:26.210 --> 16:29.145
What was that?
- Bridget's dead.

16:29.180 --> 16:32.718
(Crying):
Danny, I know! I know!

16:37.130 --> 16:38.450
(Sniffling)

16:38.490 --> 16:40.595
Oh God!

16:40.630 --> 16:44.021
She's been my best friend
since 3rd grade.

16:48.470 --> 16:50.700
They said it was an accident.

16:50.740 --> 16:52.162
She was in the shower,

16:52.210 --> 16:54.406
and she slipped
and she hit her head.

16:54.440 --> 16:57.080
She hit her head, Aidan!

16:57.110 --> 16:59.101
Just like Danny
bashed my head in,

16:59.150 --> 17:00.709
right there, on the stairs.

17:00.750 --> 17:03.287
When I heard that she was dead,
I called the cops.

17:03.320 --> 17:05.209
- Sally, this is awful,
and I am sorry.

17:05.250 --> 17:06.512
But you can't...

17:06.550 --> 17:09.383
You can't bring
the police here.

17:09.420 --> 17:11.479
- I know. I'm sorry.
I just panicked.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.055
- It's OK.
It's all right.

17:13.099 --> 17:15.592
- I didn't think
they'd trace the call.

17:15.630 --> 17:18.291
Danny said we broke up
because I was deranged.

17:18.329 --> 17:20.833
He said I was dangerous.

17:20.869 --> 17:23.601
- Deranged, maybe,
but dangerous, no.

17:24.670 --> 17:26.205
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

17:26.240 --> 17:28.231
That was stupid.

17:31.510 --> 17:33.512
I warned her.

17:36.120 --> 17:37.815
I should've done more.

17:39.590 --> 17:43.379
- I know what kind of
a person this Danny is,

17:43.430 --> 17:46.627
and trust me, there's no
stopping a man like that,

17:46.660 --> 17:48.219
so don't blame yourself.

17:48.260 --> 17:50.422
You can't even
think like that.

17:51.570 --> 17:54.130
- I have to think like that.

17:54.170 --> 17:55.592
Because it's true.

17:55.640 --> 17:57.165
- Hey...

18:01.810 --> 18:03.699
- Before I died the first time,

18:04.750 --> 18:08.471
I had this awful feeling

18:08.520 --> 18:10.682
that I wasn't
doing things right.

18:12.220 --> 18:14.279
And then now, I have
this incredible chance

18:14.320 --> 18:17.722
where I can
change everything!

18:17.760 --> 18:21.196
And that feeling's
coming back again.

18:22.730 --> 18:24.562
It's like there's
no version of myself

18:24.600 --> 18:27.194
that doesn't mess
everything up.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.334
- That's not true.

18:30.340 --> 18:31.705
(Scoffs)

18:31.740 --> 18:34.732
When you stopped me at the bar,

18:34.780 --> 18:39.741
I listened to you because
I recognized how right you were.

18:41.320 --> 18:42.617
And I've been there before...

18:43.750 --> 18:46.447
so close to slipping, but...

18:47.860 --> 18:50.682
I couldn't help myself.

18:51.830 --> 18:53.628
(Sighs)

18:53.660 --> 18:55.389
But you could.

18:55.430 --> 18:58.195
I mean, you did.
You helped me.

19:00.270 --> 19:03.570
And I don't think I'm ever
going to forget that.

19:04.870 --> 19:10.172
I am so lucky...

19:11.350 --> 19:13.375
to have you in my life.

19:14.680 --> 19:17.513
Having you here
makes me feel like I can...

19:19.720 --> 19:20.915
(Sighs)

19:20.960 --> 19:22.780
...like we can
do everything right now.

20:00.530 --> 20:02.624
- Oh my-- Not until
your guest gets here.

20:02.660 --> 20:04.526
- What does that mean,
"your guest"?

20:05.570 --> 20:07.868
- I invited Nora Sargeant.

20:07.900 --> 20:10.733
- Nora Sargeant, that's
the nurse from my hospital.

20:10.770 --> 20:12.864
Why did you invite
Nora Sargeant over?

20:14.410 --> 20:16.230
- (Whispering):
Josh marries her.

20:16.280 --> 20:17.543
- What?

20:17.580 --> 20:20.242
- Don't say anything.
He doesn't know her yet.

20:20.280 --> 20:23.511
- Um, why would she come over
and have dinner with us?

20:23.550 --> 20:24.915
You barely know her.

20:24.950 --> 20:26.645
- I don't know
if you know this,

20:26.690 --> 20:27.953
but I'm extremely charming.

20:27.990 --> 20:29.913
- I'm starting to suspect

20:29.960 --> 20:32.952
that matchmaking is
the best part of time travel.

20:32.990 --> 20:34.856
- Well, it's not
the best part.

20:35.930 --> 20:37.659
- What's the best part?

20:40.840 --> 20:42.638
(Both laughing)

20:42.670 --> 20:44.638
- Wait, wait, wait!

20:44.670 --> 20:46.559
Let me get this straight.

20:46.610 --> 20:48.032
You graduate MIT...

20:48.080 --> 20:50.401
- Oh God!
- Summa cum laude.

20:50.450 --> 20:52.771
- ...then, the first job
that you take is--

20:52.810 --> 20:53.914
- Bus boy!

20:53.950 --> 20:56.271
Railcar diner.

20:56.320 --> 20:57.788
Saw some action over there.

20:57.820 --> 21:00.653
Did time on the food prep line:
condiments, garnishes.

21:00.690 --> 21:02.658
- Didn't realize
that MIT had

21:02.690 --> 21:04.727
such an outstanding
culinary program.

21:04.760 --> 21:07.559
- Oh yeah, well, medicine and
the food-service industry

21:07.600 --> 21:08.999
are very similar, actually.

21:09.030 --> 21:11.590
Yeah, weird smells,

21:11.630 --> 21:13.564
impatient customers,
drunk staff...

21:13.600 --> 21:15.295
- (Aidan): Oh yeah!

21:15.340 --> 21:17.331
I'm drunk right now.
- No you're not.

21:17.370 --> 21:20.067
- (Sally): Speaking of drunk
right now, should we go?

21:20.110 --> 21:22.431
- Oh, right, yeah!
- I'm taking Aidan out.

21:22.480 --> 21:24.847
Is that OK? I don't wanna
leave you with the mess.

21:24.880 --> 21:27.440
- I could stay and help clean.
- That's so nice!

21:27.480 --> 21:28.709
- That's very nice of you.

21:28.750 --> 21:30.411
- (Nora): It's no problem.

21:30.450 --> 21:32.316
- Don't wait up.
We'll be really late.

21:32.350 --> 21:34.557
- Subtle, what you just did.
- (Aidan): Yeah.

21:34.590 --> 21:36.080
- What are you guys
gonna be doing?

21:36.120 --> 21:37.485
(Laughs)

21:37.530 --> 21:40.591
- OK, I wanna see
these bus-boy moves in action.

21:44.400 --> 21:47.028
(* Swing )

21:49.670 --> 21:51.536
(Sally giggles)

21:53.070 --> 21:55.004
- (Aidan): I don't get this.

21:55.040 --> 21:56.735
I don't get this, Sally.

21:56.780 --> 21:59.750
I just don't...
Where did you come from?

21:59.780 --> 22:02.477
- Great technique,
impressive routine,

22:02.520 --> 22:03.919
superb music selection.

22:03.950 --> 22:07.454
But your blood bag
lagged on the downbeat.

22:07.490 --> 22:09.754
- What the hell
are you doing here, Marcus?

22:09.790 --> 22:12.919
- Well, Bishop was curious
when you'd fall off the wagon,

22:12.960 --> 22:15.520
and by the looks of
this tasty-looking thing,

22:15.560 --> 22:16.857
I'd say soon.

22:16.900 --> 22:18.720
- Now you listen to me
very closely--

22:18.770 --> 22:19.999
- Marcus...

22:21.800 --> 22:23.905
How much longer
do you think it'll be

22:23.940 --> 22:27.069
till Bishop finds out you're
balls-deep with the Amish?

22:28.540 --> 22:30.645
- Who are you?

22:30.680 --> 22:33.377
- I'm the ghost
of Christmas-suck-it!

22:41.060 --> 22:42.653
(Laughing)

22:42.690 --> 22:44.089
- What does that mean?

22:44.130 --> 22:46.553
- It's an expression,
in reference to

22:46.590 --> 22:47.898
penetration so deep--

22:47.930 --> 22:49.796
- No, no, no.
What was that?

22:49.830 --> 22:52.697
- He wants you back in Bishop's
pocket. Stay away from him.

22:53.740 --> 22:55.060
(Sighs)

22:56.200 --> 22:57.838
I need a drink!

22:57.870 --> 22:59.861
I need a drink,
I need a drink!

23:08.720 --> 23:10.484
(Footsteps on stairs)

23:12.590 --> 23:15.651
- Hey, wipe the table down
when you're done, OK?

23:15.690 --> 23:18.523
- Josh, you're probably gonna
wanna be with Nora tomorrow.

23:18.560 --> 23:20.995
Yeah, you're gonna
have that extra wolfy

23:21.030 --> 23:23.727
je ne sais quoi left over
from your change tonight,

23:23.770 --> 23:26.694
and Nora said that it was best
around that time, so yeah.

23:26.730 --> 23:28.698
- She told you that.
- Yeah.

23:28.740 --> 23:31.107
Well, in the future,
Nora and I are galfriends,

23:31.140 --> 23:33.575
and now, we're on our way
to being galfriends.

23:33.610 --> 23:34.577
Deal with it.

23:34.610 --> 23:36.430
- It's been,
like, a month.

23:36.480 --> 23:39.108
Things must be
going pretty well.

23:39.150 --> 23:41.448
- I guess.
- No, don't guess!

23:41.480 --> 23:43.118
Guess-Josh finishes last!

23:43.150 --> 23:45.118
- Listen, on one hand,
I really like her.

23:45.150 --> 23:46.117
It's going great.

23:46.150 --> 23:47.879
She's really cool.
But I don't know.

23:47.920 --> 23:49.456
I mean, the closer we get,

23:49.490 --> 23:50.980
the more danger
I put her in.

23:51.030 --> 23:53.727
How am I gonna keep
what I am from her?

23:53.760 --> 23:55.159
Tonight, when she clocks out,

23:55.200 --> 23:57.623
she might wanna
go to a bar, or the movies.

23:57.670 --> 23:59.866
I'll be skulking down to
the hospital basement

23:59.900 --> 24:02.562
to turn into a werewolf
and grow claws, and oh my God!

24:02.600 --> 24:04.602
This is pointless.
I can't do this to her.

24:04.640 --> 24:08.008
I need to end this,
if only for her safety.

24:08.040 --> 24:09.872
- I'm gonna stop you
right there.

24:09.910 --> 24:11.469
I'm gonna stop you
right there.

24:11.510 --> 24:13.877
Josh! You marry her!
- (Aidan): Oh!

24:15.520 --> 24:16.749
- Yeah...

24:16.780 --> 24:18.145
- She's lying.

24:18.190 --> 24:19.646
- I'm not lying.

24:19.690 --> 24:22.580
- It's sweet of you to lie
to build my confidence.

24:22.620 --> 24:23.928
- I am not lying.

24:23.960 --> 24:26.520
You would marry Nora
regardless of this conversation.

24:26.560 --> 24:29.154
I'm just helping you through
some relationship hurdles.

24:29.200 --> 24:30.725
You marry her!

24:32.900 --> 24:34.038
(Scoffs)

24:34.070 --> 24:35.538
(Laughs)

24:38.810 --> 24:40.505
(Clears throat)

24:40.540 --> 24:41.803
- I'm, uh...
I can't do it.

24:41.840 --> 24:44.548
There's a full moon coming.
I can't, I can't, I can't!

24:45.710 --> 24:47.519
(Sighs)

24:47.550 --> 24:49.109
- Mazel tov, pal!

24:50.120 --> 24:51.144
(Sighs)

24:51.190 --> 24:52.840
Kids!

25:01.830 --> 25:03.889
- (Nora): Josh?

25:05.000 --> 25:06.070
Hey!

25:06.100 --> 25:07.693
You're on the schedule?
- No.

25:07.740 --> 25:08.935
No, I just...

25:08.970 --> 25:11.701
I forgot something,
so I'm just gonna...

25:12.840 --> 25:14.171
- Can we talk?

25:14.210 --> 25:15.803
- Now?

25:17.580 --> 25:19.173
- Do you wanna
just go in here?

25:28.720 --> 25:31.189
- I like you.
- I like you.

25:31.230 --> 25:33.824
- But there's
something wrong.

25:33.860 --> 25:36.329
You run every time we...

25:36.360 --> 25:37.919
- No, there's nothing wrong.

25:37.970 --> 25:39.222
There's nothing wrong.

25:39.270 --> 25:40.863
But I can't be here
right now.

25:40.900 --> 25:42.231
I gotta go.

25:42.270 --> 25:44.204
- Are you attracted to me?

25:47.740 --> 25:50.277
- Yeah! Yes!

25:50.310 --> 25:54.747
Yes! It hurts me
to even hear you say that.

25:57.890 --> 26:01.849
You're so beautiful.

26:30.020 --> 26:31.613
- Josh...

26:32.650 --> 26:34.186
Whoa! White butt!

26:34.220 --> 26:35.858
White butt!
Sorry! I'm sorry!

26:35.890 --> 26:38.757
The nurse said
you were in here.

26:38.790 --> 26:40.622
I just brought
your bag.

26:40.660 --> 26:42.196
Oh! But yes!
- The moon is coming!

26:42.230 --> 26:43.720
- What?
- Yeah.

26:43.770 --> 26:45.022
- Oh God!

26:45.070 --> 26:46.959
(Screaming)

26:48.670 --> 26:51.059
- (Nora): What was that?
Josh, what's going on?

26:51.110 --> 26:53.306
- (Sally): We gotta get you
to the basement now!

26:53.340 --> 26:56.071
Don't stop!
Go! Go, Josh!

26:56.110 --> 26:57.305
(Screaming)

26:57.340 --> 26:58.944
- Stay back, Nora!
Stay back!

26:58.980 --> 27:00.072
- What's going on?

27:01.980 --> 27:03.914
(Groaning and panting)

27:03.950 --> 27:07.045
- Aaah!

27:07.090 --> 27:08.410
- What's going on?
- Get out!

27:08.460 --> 27:09.985
Get out, Nora!
- Josh!

27:15.700 --> 27:17.691
(Screaming)

27:17.730 --> 27:19.926
- Aaah!

27:21.800 --> 27:22.870
(Flesh tearing)

27:24.870 --> 27:28.033
(Sally panting,
Josh roaring)

27:29.280 --> 27:31.009
(Whimpering)

27:40.090 --> 27:41.717
(Josh snarling)

27:49.960 --> 27:51.325
How did I marry Nora?

27:52.730 --> 27:54.664
- She was a wolf too.

27:55.870 --> 27:57.861
You scratched her.

27:58.970 --> 28:00.460
- Hal

28:00.510 --> 28:02.239
She's better off
without me.

28:03.880 --> 28:06.804
You should kill me.
Lift your curse.

28:06.850 --> 28:08.249
- Hey, would you shut up?

28:08.280 --> 28:11.079
I'm really over the whole
moping around bit.

28:11.120 --> 28:13.817
My life right now is so much
better than it used to be,

28:13.860 --> 28:16.488
and I'm really not blaming
anyone for little hiccups.

28:16.520 --> 28:17.954
- Oh God!

28:17.990 --> 28:21.358
Changing into a wolf

28:21.400 --> 28:23.095
is not a little hiccup.

28:23.130 --> 28:24.359
- Honestly though,

28:24.400 --> 28:26.027
I've seen you change,

28:26.070 --> 28:27.959
and every month,
you hum and haw

28:28.000 --> 28:29.729
and hiss and
pooh-pooh on it,

28:29.770 --> 28:31.499
and it really doesn't
seem that bad.

28:31.540 --> 28:33.008
I'm just gonna say it.

28:35.810 --> 28:37.039
- Sally, I'm sorry.

28:37.080 --> 28:38.309
- Stop apologizing.

28:38.350 --> 28:40.307
- Let me finish.

28:40.350 --> 28:42.512
You don't know
what this curse is yet.

28:42.550 --> 28:45.019
You don't. You don't know
what I've done to you.

28:45.050 --> 28:48.111
The wolf doesn't
just change you physically.

28:48.160 --> 28:49.309
It changes who you are.

28:49.360 --> 28:51.920
- Well, there's strength
in numbers, right?

28:56.230 --> 28:58.790
- I think Aidan blames me for...

29:00.840 --> 29:02.535
And he should.
- Josh...

29:02.570 --> 29:04.800
I'm with you.

29:04.840 --> 29:05.932
Always.

29:09.980 --> 29:12.506
(Siren wailing)

29:20.050 --> 29:23.281
- So, coffee stain?
- Yeah, no. Feces.

29:23.320 --> 29:25.220
- Oh!
- Yeah, I spilled a bedpan.

29:25.260 --> 29:27.024
Awesome day.

29:27.060 --> 29:28.323
(Sighs)

29:28.360 --> 29:30.089
- I don't know
what she sees in him.

29:30.130 --> 29:32.497
- No, no. I know exactly
what she sees in him.

29:32.530 --> 29:34.294
She doesn't see a wolf.

29:34.340 --> 29:36.297
- She doesn't know
that you're a wolf.

29:36.340 --> 29:38.069
- No, she thinks
I'm a mental case

29:38.110 --> 29:39.566
who barks when
he has sex,

29:39.610 --> 29:41.829
then has his friend
drag him to the basement

29:41.880 --> 29:44.144
where she spends the rest of
the night with him.

29:45.550 --> 29:47.439
I hate that smug prick.

29:47.480 --> 29:50.120
- And I overheard in the locker
room the other day

29:50.150 --> 29:51.982
that Reed is going to
propose to her.

29:54.860 --> 29:56.180
- Good.

29:58.490 --> 30:00.959
A normal life.
I'm happy for her.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.195
- I know you're upset.

30:02.230 --> 30:03.356
Put it in perspective.

30:03.400 --> 30:05.129
You were only together a month.

30:05.170 --> 30:07.525
There are other girls.
- It's not just about that.

30:07.570 --> 30:10.870
This whole situation has
put things in perspective.

30:10.910 --> 30:12.469
It's made it perfectly clear

30:12.510 --> 30:14.604
that I will never
have a human life.

30:14.640 --> 30:17.849
- Oh, Josh! You could have
a normal, human life.

30:17.880 --> 30:20.201
Look at me and Sally.
- You guys are doing great.

30:20.250 --> 30:21.513
But I just--

30:21.550 --> 30:23.279
I wonder if...

30:25.250 --> 30:27.344
you couldn't use
a dose of caution.

30:27.390 --> 30:31.020
- Excuse me? What do you mean,
"a dose of caution"?

30:31.060 --> 30:34.223
We can trust Sally, Josh.
- I know you say that--

30:34.260 --> 30:36.024
- She's helped
me keep Bishop away.

30:36.060 --> 30:38.961
You've got a lot of nerve
saying that she's the problem.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.594
- I know she's helped you, OK?

30:42.940 --> 30:44.499
But, I mean, has she?
I don't know.

30:44.540 --> 30:45.564
We don't know!

30:45.610 --> 30:47.908
I just don't want
this whole thing

30:47.940 --> 30:49.169
to blow up in your face.

30:49.210 --> 30:50.530
- Mm-hmm.

31:04.290 --> 31:07.021
(Both panting)

31:28.350 --> 31:30.569
- Let me ask you something.
- What?

31:30.620 --> 31:33.112
- When we sleep together,

31:34.260 --> 31:36.285
in the future,

31:36.320 --> 31:38.152
where do we sleep?

31:38.190 --> 31:40.420
Do we sleep upstairs?
Do we sleep downstairs?

31:40.460 --> 31:42.349
Do we get a motel room?
What happens?

31:42.400 --> 31:44.494
- Um...

31:44.530 --> 31:46.589
We don't sleep together.

31:46.630 --> 31:48.962
- No, I mean, after
you got your body back.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.503
- Yeah, we don't sleep together.

31:51.540 --> 31:53.338
(Laughing)

31:53.370 --> 31:54.701
- But wait a second.

31:54.740 --> 31:57.949
I was attracted to you
the moment that I...

31:57.980 --> 32:00.039
I flirted with you!
- I know!

32:00.080 --> 32:02.469
- So, obviously,
we must've...

32:02.520 --> 32:04.318
- No.

32:04.350 --> 32:06.910
We obviously mustn't've.

32:08.120 --> 32:10.384
We don't sleep together.

32:11.760 --> 32:14.252
(Bird calling)

32:23.040 --> 32:25.600
- No, I don't like this.
Josh always texts me back.

32:25.640 --> 32:27.369
- His phone's probably
in his bag.

32:27.410 --> 32:30.334
He said he'd meet me
in the woods. I'm gonna go.

32:30.380 --> 32:32.576
- Uh, be careful, OK?

32:35.180 --> 32:36.511
- What's that about?

32:36.550 --> 32:39.747
- Well, you're going
out there alone. And, uh...

32:39.790 --> 32:41.258
- What?
- Nothing.

32:41.290 --> 32:42.485
- Tell me!

32:42.520 --> 32:43.658
- It's just something

32:43.690 --> 32:45.158
I figured out recently.

32:45.190 --> 32:47.989
Now's not the time.
It's not a big deal.

32:48.030 --> 32:51.091
- The only thing creepier than
grim Aidan is cryptic Aidan.

32:51.130 --> 32:52.291
And blood-drunk Aidan.

32:52.330 --> 32:53.365
(Shudders)

32:54.470 --> 32:56.529
What is it?

32:57.670 --> 32:59.001
- I love you.

33:02.140 --> 33:04.279
- I love you.

33:12.720 --> 33:16.156
- So, um, is this weird for you?

33:16.190 --> 33:17.453
Is it too much?

33:17.490 --> 33:19.458
- Yeah, it's super weird.

33:19.490 --> 33:21.424
Oh my God!
It's so weird.

33:21.460 --> 33:24.259
- I'm gonna bite you
on your face.

33:24.300 --> 33:26.223
- It's wonderfully weird.

33:30.170 --> 33:32.207
I'm gonna go.
- OK. Be careful. Seriously.

33:32.240 --> 33:33.503
- OK. Yeah.
- OK.

33:51.530 --> 33:53.726
- Should we check the woods?
- Oh my God!

33:53.760 --> 33:57.298
- (Aidan): Hey! Where were you?
- (Josh): Hey, I'm sorry, OK.

33:57.330 --> 33:59.492
- What the hell is
Ray doing in our home?

33:59.530 --> 34:01.191
- Have we met?

34:01.240 --> 34:03.231
- You tried to ruin
my friend's life.

34:03.270 --> 34:05.238
- Come on. Don't talk
to him like that.

34:05.270 --> 34:07.432
- What's this?
A housebroken leech?

34:07.470 --> 34:08.733
- Ray!

34:08.780 --> 34:10.703
- (Laughing):
Be careful, old man.

34:10.739 --> 34:13.710
- (Josh): Guys, stop it!
Come on!

34:13.750 --> 34:14.842
Stop it!

34:14.880 --> 34:16.609
Come on!

34:16.650 --> 34:20.438
- OK, I'm gonna circle back
when it's not so crowded.

34:20.489 --> 34:22.083
- Yeah, good.

34:24.530 --> 34:26.851
- Look, Sally,
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

34:26.889 --> 34:29.496
- Josh, Ray is evil.
He tries to kill Nora.

34:29.530 --> 34:31.089
- That's not what happened!

34:31.130 --> 34:33.462
That's not what happens, OK?

34:33.500 --> 34:34.864
I'll never have Nora.

34:34.900 --> 34:36.732
I'll never have
a normal life.

34:36.770 --> 34:39.409
I'm done pretending
that I'm not a monster!

34:39.440 --> 34:41.408
- You don't have to be, Josh!

34:41.440 --> 34:42.703
Ray is your maker!

34:44.710 --> 34:46.871
If you kill him,
it lifts the curse.

34:46.909 --> 34:49.469
- What the hell
are you talking about?

34:49.520 --> 34:51.648
- He's a bad man.
You have to believe me.

34:51.690 --> 34:54.216
If you kill him--
- I'm not gonna kill him, Sally.

34:54.260 --> 34:56.614
I'm not a murderer.
I'm not gonna kill the guy.

34:56.659 --> 34:59.630
- If what Sally says is true,
then that's the guy

34:59.660 --> 35:01.492
that took everything from you,

35:01.530 --> 35:02.793
and your life could be--

35:02.830 --> 35:04.525
- This is my life, man!

35:04.570 --> 35:07.562
THIS IS MY LIFE!

35:07.600 --> 35:09.762
Not your version of it, Sally!
This is it!

35:09.800 --> 35:11.302
Don't you understand that?

35:11.340 --> 35:12.660
This is it for me!

35:14.410 --> 35:16.174
I don't fit in here anymore!

35:16.210 --> 35:19.669
I don't fit in here anymore,
and the longer that I stay,

35:19.710 --> 35:21.439
the worse I feel
about what I am.

35:21.480 --> 35:23.278
It wasn't supposed to
be this way!

35:23.320 --> 35:24.913
It wasn't supposed to
be this way!

35:24.950 --> 35:28.113
- Josh, please!
- No! No.

35:31.630 --> 35:34.395
There's nothing left--

35:34.430 --> 35:36.797
There's nothing
left for me in this house

35:36.830 --> 35:39.765
except a failed experiment.

35:41.970 --> 35:43.597
I'm moving out.

35:57.880 --> 35:59.587
- This is all wrong.

36:02.390 --> 36:04.427
I messed it all up
when I changed things.

36:04.460 --> 36:06.679
- You didn't cause this.

36:06.730 --> 36:10.291
- Well, Josh is ruining his life
with Ray because of me.

36:10.330 --> 36:12.219
- He's not ruining his life.

36:12.270 --> 36:14.432
It's just different.

36:14.470 --> 36:16.290
Josh will recover.

36:16.340 --> 36:19.435
Different isn't wrong.
- It is wrong.

36:19.470 --> 36:20.699
(Sighs)

36:20.740 --> 36:21.901
It's wrong.

36:21.940 --> 36:24.250
This is not how
it was supposed to be.

36:24.280 --> 36:25.770
- Not how it's suppo--

36:25.810 --> 36:28.245
Sally, when are you
going to give up

36:28.280 --> 36:31.716
on this preconceived notion of
the way that things should be.

36:31.750 --> 36:34.913
Did you know that this is
the first time in over 200 years

36:34.960 --> 36:36.610
that I have felt human?

36:36.660 --> 36:39.322
What, am I supposed to
feel guilty about that?

36:39.360 --> 36:41.351
Are we supposed to
feel guilty

36:41.400 --> 36:44.722
because this guy refuses
to get his life together?

36:44.770 --> 36:46.420
(Sighs)

36:48.570 --> 36:49.890
- Oh my God!

36:53.810 --> 36:55.369
I changed you.

36:55.410 --> 36:56.900
- Oh God, Sally!

36:56.940 --> 36:59.546
- (Choked up):
The Aidan that I love...

37:00.810 --> 37:02.744
that I've always loved...

37:03.780 --> 37:05.817
would never give up on Josh.

37:07.290 --> 37:09.213
- Sally...
- (Crying): Oh my God!

37:10.790 --> 37:13.282
I don't think that
we're meant to be together!

37:14.660 --> 37:17.027
- Wait a second.
- I can't do this.

37:17.060 --> 37:18.698
No, we're roommates.
- Hold on.

37:18.730 --> 37:20.926
- We're supposed to
be roommates.

37:20.970 --> 37:23.530
That's all that we can be
until I fix this.

37:23.570 --> 37:25.709
- Please just stay here
and talk to me.

37:25.740 --> 37:28.334
- I'm sorry.
- Sally, don't do this.

37:48.830 --> 37:50.855
(Horns honking)

37:52.100 --> 37:54.398
(* Rock )

37:57.470 --> 37:59.802
- (Ray): You ever been
attacked by a leech?

37:59.840 --> 38:01.535
- Yeah.

38:02.780 --> 38:04.305
Two of them.

38:04.350 --> 38:07.706
They cornered me, threw me down,
beat the hell out of me.

38:09.780 --> 38:12.010
- That goes on
a little bit too much...

38:14.020 --> 38:15.988
except when the moon
is big and round,

38:16.020 --> 38:17.715
like it is tonight.

38:19.130 --> 38:20.586
You know what?

38:20.630 --> 38:23.019
I wanna show
you something.

38:23.060 --> 38:24.425
Come on!

38:24.470 --> 38:26.666
I wanna show you something!

38:30.800 --> 38:33.007
(* Woman singing rock )

38:34.610 --> 38:36.772
- That gentleman
sent you a drink.

38:40.150 --> 38:41.879
(Sighs)

38:51.890 --> 38:54.450
- So glad to see

38:54.500 --> 38:57.094
the Aidan I know
and love is back.

38:59.900 --> 39:01.390
- Why do we fight?

39:01.440 --> 39:03.795
- Because we hate each other.

39:10.910 --> 39:13.607
(Both laughing)

39:18.650 --> 39:20.687
- Hey, let me
ask you something.

39:20.720 --> 39:23.155
How do you like 'em aged?
I'm gonna buy you a drink.

39:23.190 --> 39:24.828
Huh? Ladies!

39:24.860 --> 39:26.089
Hello!

39:26.130 --> 39:27.859
(Laughing)

39:30.960 --> 39:33.759
- This is where
they gorge themselves.

39:33.800 --> 39:36.440
I once saw a funeral van
here loaded with bodies

39:36.470 --> 39:38.939
covered in bite marks.

39:38.970 --> 39:41.940
- They don't all come here.
- Think your friend's different?

39:41.980 --> 39:44.074
They all come here,

39:44.110 --> 39:46.169
so blood drunk,
they can hardly walk.

39:46.210 --> 39:47.803
They're ripe
for the popping.

39:49.220 --> 39:51.177
- What are you doing here?

39:51.220 --> 39:53.917
- Why are you here?
Do you know what this place is?

39:53.950 --> 39:57.113
- Yeah, I followed Aidan here,
then realized what it was.

39:57.160 --> 39:59.959
Josh, whatever Ray is
trying to get you to do,

39:59.990 --> 40:01.526
you don't need to do this.

40:01.560 --> 40:02.527
- You should go.

40:02.560 --> 40:03.857
- No, this isn't you.

40:03.900 --> 40:05.994
- You don't--
You don't know me.

40:06.030 --> 40:08.431
(Aidan and Marcus laughing)

40:26.550 --> 40:28.655
- It looks like
we got some strays in need of

40:28.690 --> 40:29.680
obedience training.

40:29.720 --> 40:30.983
- You want some of this?

40:31.020 --> 40:33.125
That's a nice leather jacket.

40:33.160 --> 40:35.527
Dead flesh, undead flesh.

40:35.560 --> 40:36.789
Ah!

40:36.830 --> 40:39.162
- Aidan!
- All right, all right!

40:39.200 --> 40:41.123
There's no line
in the sand here.

40:41.170 --> 40:42.831
- Look at the puppy.

40:44.070 --> 40:46.562
(Ray and Aidan grunting)

40:51.080 --> 40:52.502
(Sally grunts)

41:05.290 --> 41:06.780
- (Sally): Ray!

41:08.630 --> 41:11.691
Stop! Stop!
- Hey, hey, hey!

41:11.730 --> 41:13.129
You're one of us now, huh?

41:13.170 --> 41:16.060
Why don't you just enjoy it?

41:16.100 --> 41:18.899
Enjoy it!
And join the party! Ha ha!

41:20.770 --> 41:22.670
That's my boy!

41:24.110 --> 41:25.202
Ah!

41:25.250 --> 41:27.571
- (Sally): Aidan! Aidan!

41:27.610 --> 41:30.216
- (Aidan): Hey! What are you
doing? Are you crazy?

41:30.250 --> 41:32.014
- (Josh): What do you think?

41:32.050 --> 41:33.814
- What are you doing?
- Hey! Stop it!

41:33.850 --> 41:35.079
- (Josh): What do you mean?

41:35.120 --> 41:36.918
- (Sally): Hey!
- (Josh): Sally!

41:38.830 --> 41:41.527
- Oh God! Oh God!
No, no, no, no!

41:46.300 --> 41:47.790
I'm S O SO I ry I

41:47.830 --> 41:49.059
I'm S O SO I ry I

41:50.300 --> 41:52.906
Let' el t's go!pllléi's go!

42:00.150 --> 42:02.812
- No!
- I forgive you.

42:04.120 --> 42:06.543
I love you.

42:06.590 --> 42:09.082
- (Crying): No, baby,
don't do this to me, please!

42:09.120 --> 42:11.589
Please, don't go!
Don't...
