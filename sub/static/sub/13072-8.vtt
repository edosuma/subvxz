WEBVTT

00:00.587 --> 00:02.626
Previously on Guilt.

00:02.727 --> 00:04.660
Stay away from me.

00:06.564 --> 00:07.730
Guard!

00:07.766 --> 00:09.769
I understand that you want
to protect your sister,

00:09.836 --> 00:11.101
but planting evidence.

00:11.136 --> 00:13.338
You better stay the hell away
from this investigation.

00:13.373 --> 00:15.330
<i>The Russians, they think
I might give them up</i>

00:15.355 --> 00:17.342
to save Grace if this goes to trial.

00:17.377 --> 00:18.443
They will kill me.

00:18.478 --> 00:19.477
<i>That woman there with Molly,</i>

00:19.513 --> 00:21.379
I think I know where
I've seen her before.

00:21.415 --> 00:24.516
Jessica Marshall,
missing, presumed dead.

00:24.551 --> 00:27.552
Please tell me Gentleman 33
was at the club last night.

00:27.588 --> 00:28.720
<i>Yeah, I saw his face.</i>

00:28.755 --> 00:31.523
You keep my secrets, I'll keep yours.

00:31.558 --> 00:33.592
I need you to get a vial

00:33.627 --> 00:35.360
<i>of Molly Ryan's blood.</i>

00:35.395 --> 00:38.563
Molly Ryan was an escort
for an ultra-exclusive,

00:38.599 --> 00:40.532
ultra-private sex club.

00:40.567 --> 00:42.734
- I saw him.
- Who, Neville?

00:42.769 --> 00:44.736
Prince Theo killed Molly.

00:44.771 --> 00:46.371
What is it, darling?

00:46.406 --> 00:47.572
Nothing, just another scandal.

00:50.677 --> 00:52.677
- You exposed The Courtenay.
- I swear, it wasn't me.

00:52.713 --> 00:54.613
Please.

01:16.670 --> 01:18.403
I mean, it's all over the tabloids.

01:18.438 --> 01:19.504
Do you want to know what I heard

01:19.539 --> 01:20.705
about The Courtenay Club, Teddy?

01:20.741 --> 01:22.507
You can't call him "Teddy,"
he's the prince.

01:22.542 --> 01:24.676
- I'll allow it.
- I'll allow it.

01:24.711 --> 01:25.810
I will.

01:25.846 --> 01:27.712
It's my birthright,
handed down by God himself.

01:27.748 --> 01:30.582
Yeah, through the queen's knickers.

01:30.617 --> 01:32.584
Stop. She'll hear you.

01:32.619 --> 01:33.818
You know she hears everything.

01:35.455 --> 01:37.689
Even the secrets you mumble
in your sleep?

01:37.724 --> 01:40.392
Go on, then, spill.

01:40.427 --> 01:41.660
What did you hear about The Courtenay?

01:41.695 --> 01:43.762
Remember Archie, from Rowing?

01:43.797 --> 01:45.690
My cousin said his father's a member.

01:45.725 --> 01:48.475
Had a thing for candles.

01:48.511 --> 01:50.827
Hot wax, all up his

01:50.862 --> 01:52.671
- you know...
- My broker said that her boss

01:52.706 --> 01:54.372
went on a surprise holiday,

01:54.408 --> 01:55.507
an hour after the story broke.

01:55.542 --> 01:57.575
This Molly Ryan murder caught

01:57.611 --> 01:59.644
a lot of randy blokes
with their pants down.

01:59.680 --> 02:01.446
Any one of them could have done her in.

02:01.481 --> 02:02.747
She was pregnant, wasn't she?

02:04.245 --> 02:05.550
I bet the baby daddy didn't want

02:05.585 --> 02:06.751
her tattling to his wife.

02:06.787 --> 02:08.485
What do you think, Charlotte?

02:10.424 --> 02:11.790
Do you really want to know what I think?

02:12.705 --> 02:16.207
The killer could be sitting
at this very table.

02:21.535 --> 02:22.667
Dun-dun-dun!

02:26.693 --> 02:28.441
Excuse me.

02:28.475 --> 02:29.607
I need to use the loo.

02:35.649 --> 02:37.615
That one's going to keep you
on your toes, Teddy.

02:40.487 --> 02:42.520
You have no idea.

02:44.284 --> 02:45.417
Charlotte.

02:46.793 --> 02:48.660
- What do you think you're doing?
- Let me go.

02:48.695 --> 02:49.728
I'm going home.

02:49.763 --> 02:51.463
We have guests, Charlotte.

02:51.498 --> 02:52.697
You're hurting me.

02:52.733 --> 02:54.532
Pull yourself together,

02:54.568 --> 02:57.469
and come back to the party, right now.

03:00.574 --> 03:02.407
No.

03:24.464 --> 03:26.564
<i>So let me get this straight, Molly Ryan</i>

03:26.600 --> 03:28.333
was killed by the prince

03:28.368 --> 03:29.778
with a knife in the whore's apartment.

03:30.637 --> 03:32.199
Why not Colonel Mustard

03:32.234 --> 03:34.324
in the conservatory with a candlestick?

03:35.575 --> 03:36.708
I know how crazy it sounds,

03:36.743 --> 03:38.796
- but I believe Neville.
- Whether it's true

03:38.832 --> 03:42.380
or not, good luck convincing
a British jury

03:42.415 --> 03:43.715
that their beloved prince is really

03:43.750 --> 03:45.450
a sex-crazed slasher.

03:45.485 --> 03:46.785
No, you're going to need
a hell of a lot more

03:46.820 --> 03:48.419
than the rantings of some madman.

03:48.455 --> 03:49.788
Neville gave me this, too.

03:51.525 --> 03:52.724
He memorized the license plate number

03:52.759 --> 03:54.793
to the car Prince Theo was in that night

03:54.828 --> 03:56.461
- when he fled the scene.
- Or it's the license plate

03:56.496 --> 03:57.796
of his favorite ice cream truck.

03:57.831 --> 03:59.631
Or it's code for "I'm in a loony bin,

03:59.666 --> 04:01.466
- get me out of here."
- We finally

04:01.501 --> 04:03.468
have a concrete alternative suspect.

04:03.503 --> 04:04.602
I'm not going to drop it

04:04.638 --> 04:06.371
just because Neville's

04:06.406 --> 04:08.306
- not an ideal witness.
- I didn't say drop it.

04:08.341 --> 04:10.375
It's just that we pulled the short straw

04:10.410 --> 04:12.410
when Judge Manning
was assigned to our case.

04:12.445 --> 04:15.313
She is a prosecutor's wet dream
and a staunch monarchist,

04:15.348 --> 04:17.415
meaning, she won't let us utter

04:17.450 --> 04:19.384
the word "Prince Theo" in court

04:19.418 --> 04:21.112
- without substantial proof.
- So I'll get proof.

04:21.137 --> 04:22.420
All right. Go ahead.

04:22.455 --> 04:24.622
I'm going to stay
on The Courtenay angle.

04:24.658 --> 04:25.790
We got to tie as many men

04:25.826 --> 04:28.459
with motive as we can to Molly Ryan.

04:28.495 --> 04:29.977
Wasn't the scoop you leaked to The <i> Story</i>

04:30.012 --> 04:30.795
supposed to take care of that?

04:30.831 --> 04:32.497
Unfortunately, your DJ friend

04:32.532 --> 04:34.432
was not as forthcoming

04:34.467 --> 04:36.367
with Veena as I would have hoped.

04:39.506 --> 04:41.339
"Three members of Parliament,

04:41.374 --> 04:42.640
two energy tycoons."

04:42.676 --> 04:44.475
That's all Roz gave her?

04:44.511 --> 04:46.611
Don't worry, we're gonna get
those dirty bastards.

04:46.646 --> 04:47.812
And if we don't?

04:49.749 --> 04:52.220
Then we got to turn our
negatives into positives.

04:52.565 --> 04:55.620
Like your sister, whom, for
better or for worse, we now know

04:55.655 --> 04:57.455
was in the apartment
at the time of the murder.

04:57.490 --> 04:59.657
Yeah, and she doesn't remember anything.

04:59.693 --> 05:01.326
I know someone,

05:01.361 --> 05:02.963
dare I say a "trained professional,"

05:02.999 --> 05:05.110
who can poke around your sister's brain,

05:05.135 --> 05:07.665
and help her remember something
other than herself

05:07.701 --> 05:10.417
- holding the knife.
- Prince Theo was holding the knife.

05:10.452 --> 05:11.906
You chase your wild
geese, I'll chase mine.

05:20.066 --> 05:21.065
Look,

05:21.381 --> 05:22.480
what happened with Finch...

05:22.515 --> 05:23.581
I don't want to talk about it.

05:24.036 --> 05:25.882
It's going to be okay.

05:26.140 --> 05:27.652
No one's going to find that doorstop

05:27.687 --> 05:29.582
at the bottom of the Thames.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.357
Do you know how many people
probably want Finch dead

05:32.392 --> 05:33.887
now The Courtenay's been exposed?

05:34.361 --> 05:35.793
The police have no reason
to come looking for...

05:35.829 --> 05:36.761
Don't.

05:37.473 --> 05:39.665
Don't touch me, Roz.

05:40.960 --> 05:42.544
Let me help you.

05:43.123 --> 05:44.402
I don't want your kind of help.

05:44.437 --> 05:45.637
What's that supposed to mean?

05:45.672 --> 05:46.671
I had just moved to London

05:46.706 --> 05:48.606
for a fresh start, okay?

05:48.978 --> 05:50.342
And somehow you convinced me

05:50.377 --> 05:51.609
that it was a good idea to sell myself.

05:51.645 --> 05:54.379
If I remember right,
you didn't take much convincing.

05:58.385 --> 05:59.550
Look, I'm sorry.

05:59.586 --> 06:01.850
This isn't a life, Roz.

06:02.186 --> 06:03.970
Shagging strangers.

06:04.624 --> 06:06.878
Seeing a man get shot
right in front of me.

06:08.662 --> 06:09.947
Killing someone.

06:10.330 --> 06:11.462
You did what you had to do.

06:11.498 --> 06:13.331
I shouldn't have had to have done it.

06:16.503 --> 06:19.057
Look, I don't want this life anymore.

06:19.539 --> 06:22.473
And I really do not want you.

06:22.509 --> 06:24.342
Kaley, I know today was messed up...

06:24.377 --> 06:25.610
So just get out.

06:25.645 --> 06:27.248
Okay?

06:27.283 --> 06:28.446
Just get out.

06:46.499 --> 06:47.699
What the hell is this?

06:47.734 --> 06:48.766
Are you all right? Wh...

06:48.802 --> 06:49.957
Why didn't you call me?

06:49.992 --> 06:51.536
Why wasn't I called?

06:51.571 --> 06:53.738
It's up to the inmate
whether they inform anyone.

06:53.773 --> 06:55.406
I told them not to.

06:56.543 --> 06:57.347
I'm fine.

06:57.382 --> 06:59.477
They made me use this wheelchair.

07:00.580 --> 07:01.679
What happened?

07:02.214 --> 07:04.582
I was stabbed... by another inmate.

07:04.617 --> 07:05.683
It's not that bad, really.

07:05.719 --> 07:06.924
I'm okay.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.519
Please don't tell Natalie.

07:08.555 --> 07:10.521
I don't want to worry her
more than I already have.

07:10.881 --> 07:12.557
Really? That's... Okay, that's it.

07:12.592 --> 07:14.149
That's where you draw the line.

07:14.174 --> 07:15.560
All right, fine.

07:16.134 --> 07:17.295
But you can bet your ass

07:17.330 --> 07:18.596
I'm going to milk this
for all it is worth.

07:18.631 --> 07:21.022
You are not stepping one foot
in that gen-pop

07:21.057 --> 07:22.734
- until we're through trial.
- Thanks, Stan.

07:23.168 --> 07:24.469
Oh, believe me, you're going

07:24.504 --> 07:26.604
to do something for me as well.

07:26.639 --> 07:28.506
I brought with me someone here today

07:28.541 --> 07:30.374
who's going to poke around
in your grey matter,

07:30.409 --> 07:31.743
and help us figure out

07:31.778 --> 07:33.990
what happened during
your little blackout.

07:34.025 --> 07:35.747
She is a memory recovery specialist,

07:35.815 --> 07:37.715
and she uses hypnosis.

07:38.197 --> 07:39.860
You want to hypnotize me?

07:39.895 --> 07:42.320
Dr. Caldwell's not going to make
you cluck like a chicken.

07:42.355 --> 07:43.554
She's going to put you under,

07:43.590 --> 07:45.323
and take you back to the night
that Molly was killed.

07:45.358 --> 07:46.758
No, I don't want to go back there.

07:46.793 --> 07:48.659
What if I remember something
that none of us wants to hear?

07:48.695 --> 07:50.695
- That I...
- Listen, in order to stay

07:50.730 --> 07:52.497
ahead of the prosecution,

07:52.532 --> 07:54.365
I need to know what I'm dealing
with here.

07:54.908 --> 07:57.635
No one needs to know what
we learn, not even your sister.

07:58.017 --> 08:00.638
And I promise you, anything you
say cannot be used at trial.

08:02.575 --> 08:03.741
Will you be here?

08:04.618 --> 08:06.744
Well, Caldwell says
that my bold personality

08:06.780 --> 08:08.479
may taint the process.

08:09.616 --> 08:11.774
Who am I to argue with a doctor, right?

08:15.455 --> 08:17.388
I'm scared, Stan.

08:19.492 --> 08:20.658
Yeah, I know, kid.

08:22.462 --> 08:24.328
But the truth about what you did

08:24.364 --> 08:27.298
is buried somewhere
in that noodle of yours,

08:27.333 --> 08:29.406
and eventually, it's going
to come back to you.

08:30.570 --> 08:34.371
Would you rather find out now
that you killed Molly

08:34.407 --> 08:35.740
while we can still argue to a jury

08:35.775 --> 08:37.575
that you were not in your right mind,

08:37.610 --> 08:41.312
or recover your memory
after you've been convicted,

08:41.347 --> 08:45.166
only to discover that you
were innocent all along?

08:51.391 --> 08:53.465
You're safe here, Grace.

08:53.793 --> 08:55.881
You have nothing to fear.

08:58.431 --> 09:01.788
Now I want you to take several
deep breaths.

09:02.708 --> 09:04.309
Nice and easy.

09:06.639 --> 09:08.199
There you are.

09:09.195 --> 09:12.276
In... and out.

09:14.149 --> 09:15.380
You feeling relaxed?

09:16.382 --> 09:17.443
A-a little.

09:17.750 --> 09:18.891
Good.

09:21.393 --> 09:24.027
Now I want you to travel back
in your mind

09:24.524 --> 09:26.652
to the night Molly was killed.

09:27.594 --> 09:29.005
Will you do that with me?

09:29.562 --> 09:30.708
Yes.

09:32.131 --> 09:33.907
I'm going to count backwards,

09:34.501 --> 09:36.756
and when I snap my fingers,

09:37.370 --> 09:39.244
you'll remember, Grace.

09:40.372 --> 09:41.472
Okay.

09:41.508 --> 09:44.609
Three... two...

09:44.644 --> 09:46.009
...one.

10:13.021 --> 10:14.888
Wakey, wakey, princess.

10:14.923 --> 10:16.089
Molly?

10:16.124 --> 10:18.256
Heard you snoring from across the quad.

10:22.998 --> 10:24.197
My hands are like ice.

10:24.233 --> 10:25.481
Oh, here.

10:26.529 --> 10:28.345
It is freezing.

10:29.137 --> 10:30.871
Oh, thanks.

10:30.906 --> 10:32.680
Ooh, this is so soft.

10:33.175 --> 10:34.941
You realize you're never getting
this back,

10:34.977 --> 10:36.683
- right?
- Keep it.

10:36.719 --> 10:38.979
My mom knits me a new one,
like, every month.

10:39.014 --> 10:40.146
<i>Did those selfish cows</i>

10:40.182 --> 10:42.015
- give you the boot last night?
- Oh, I gave myself

10:42.050 --> 10:43.116
the boot.

10:43.151 --> 10:44.747
The dork was pulling an all-nighter

10:44.782 --> 10:46.219
fueled by the world's stinkiest curry.

10:46.255 --> 10:48.221
And then the screamer

10:48.257 --> 10:50.855
stumbled home with her
latest loser. I mean, hello,

10:50.891 --> 10:53.226
- I'm not deaf.<i>
-Roz and I</i> <i>are looking at a new flat</i>

10:53.262 --> 10:54.921
that's a bit pricey.

10:55.864 --> 10:56.897
A third roommate might help.

10:56.932 --> 10:58.131
Goodness gracious,

10:58.166 --> 10:59.933
Molly Ryan, are you asking me
to move in?

10:59.968 --> 11:01.201
We haven't even said "I love you."

11:01.236 --> 11:03.103
Well,

11:03.138 --> 11:04.871
let's make it official, then.

11:04.907 --> 11:06.039
<i>Grace Atwood,</i>

11:06.074 --> 11:07.500
I love you.

11:07.910 --> 11:09.109
Would you move in with me?

11:09.144 --> 11:10.210
I love you, too,

11:10.245 --> 11:12.112
- Molly Ryan!
- Is that a yes?

11:12.147 --> 11:14.214
- Yes!
- Yes!

11:16.985 --> 11:19.819
♪ Can you keep me close,
can you offer me warmth?

11:19.855 --> 11:21.021
<i>Where are you, Grace?</i>

11:21.056 --> 11:23.990
The day I decided to move in with Molly.

11:24.026 --> 11:26.259
<i>Going to a happy
place is a natural response</i>

11:26.295 --> 11:28.895
<i>to not wanting to face
a traumatic event.</i>

11:28.931 --> 11:30.163
But we need to go back

11:30.198 --> 11:32.198
to that night, Grace.

11:32.908 --> 11:34.935
The night Molly died.

11:39.998 --> 11:41.908
What did Missing Persons have to say

11:41.944 --> 11:43.209
about our Jessica Marshall?

11:43.245 --> 11:45.812
Not much more than we read
in her file, actually,

11:45.847 --> 11:48.882
but I did have a little bit more luck

11:48.917 --> 11:50.050
with the forensic accountants.

11:50.085 --> 11:51.918
Jessica Marshall's financials

11:51.954 --> 11:53.019
show regular payments going out

11:53.055 --> 11:54.921
to a company called United Luxury.

11:54.957 --> 11:56.222
Guess what naughty company

11:56.258 --> 11:58.124
that's a front for?

11:58.160 --> 11:59.259
The Courtenay Club.

11:59.294 --> 12:00.611
Yes.

12:00.803 --> 12:03.063
Jessica Marshall was a client,
which is how

12:03.098 --> 12:04.584
she wound up on Molly Ryan's phone.

12:04.619 --> 12:06.066
Did tech come up with anything useful

12:06.101 --> 12:07.587
from the metadata on the picture?

12:07.612 --> 12:09.903
The timestamp shows
it was taken several hours

12:09.938 --> 12:11.004
after Jessica was last seen

12:11.039 --> 12:12.718
by coworkers, but...

12:12.753 --> 12:15.075
there's no geotag,
so we can't prove whether

12:15.110 --> 12:17.143
it was taken at The Courtenay
Club or anywhere else.

12:17.179 --> 12:19.145
I'm no art expert, but...

12:19.181 --> 12:21.214
I'm betting someone paid
a pretty penny for that painting

12:21.249 --> 12:23.560
- once upon a time.
- You think we could trace it?

12:23.585 --> 12:25.118
To see where Jessica ended up?

12:25.153 --> 12:26.953
Look into its provenance?

12:27.504 --> 12:28.641
"Its provenance"?

12:28.677 --> 12:30.821
Look who's breaking out
the ten-pound words today.

12:31.229 --> 12:33.159
Do you want to ride my arse,

12:33.195 --> 12:34.673
or do you want me to look into this?

12:35.552 --> 12:38.865
Uh, no, I want you to look into
its provenance, please.

12:38.900 --> 12:40.000
But just do it quietly, will you?

12:40.035 --> 12:42.035
- Hey, Gwen.
- Hey.

12:42.070 --> 12:43.856
What's with the good mood today?

12:44.206 --> 12:45.547
Is it that rare?

12:46.202 --> 12:47.435
Yeah, but in a good way.

12:47.976 --> 12:49.009
Like a diamond.

12:50.631 --> 12:53.013
Judge Manning has been assigned
to the Molly Ryan trial.

12:53.403 --> 12:56.182
Well, Manning won't put up
with any of Gutterie's tricks,

12:56.218 --> 12:57.283
that's for sure.

12:57.319 --> 12:59.548
- Exactly.
- That's great.

13:00.148 --> 13:01.755
You deserve a lucky break on this case,

13:01.790 --> 13:03.023
after all your hard work.

13:03.595 --> 13:05.158
I couldn't have made this case
without you.

13:07.485 --> 13:08.675
I was wrong

13:08.710 --> 13:10.764
to question your ethics, Alex.

13:11.726 --> 13:12.992
Well,

13:13.201 --> 13:15.068
I've forgotten about it already.

13:16.171 --> 13:18.233
Let me make it up to you.

13:18.269 --> 13:20.273
Trial prep later, over drinks?

13:20.309 --> 13:21.841
That sounds great.

13:34.923 --> 13:36.856
Okay, big smiles, everyone.

13:37.926 --> 13:39.926
Oh!

13:39.961 --> 13:41.061
That one's a keeper.

13:41.096 --> 13:42.929
And so are you. Prince Theo's lucky

13:42.964 --> 13:45.065
- to have you.
-That's what I tell him every day.

13:45.100 --> 13:46.199
Oh.

13:48.937 --> 13:50.136
Good morning, Miss Crockleby.

13:50.172 --> 13:51.480
Good morning, Phillip.

13:52.140 --> 13:54.666
Has the prince decided
to reassign my SO-14 detail?

13:54.701 --> 13:55.513
Not at all.

13:55.548 --> 13:57.010
You'll be back
with your assigned security

13:57.045 --> 13:59.179
after a brief trip to the palace.

14:00.105 --> 14:01.014
If it's all the same to you,

14:01.083 --> 14:02.982
I'd rather not wind up
trapped in a tower.

14:03.018 --> 14:05.085
His Highness just wants to talk.

14:06.221 --> 14:07.887
Is that what he told his dog?

14:09.057 --> 14:10.607
You've got nothing to worry about.

14:10.642 --> 14:12.557
He just wants to talk.

14:13.704 --> 14:15.061
I promise.

14:27.042 --> 14:28.842
I wasn't expecting you to show up here.

14:28.877 --> 14:29.909
I helped plant evidence.

14:29.945 --> 14:30.977
You arrested my sister.

14:31.012 --> 14:32.052
Can we call it even?

14:32.848 --> 14:34.214
Look, despite everything that happened,

14:34.249 --> 14:36.116
I still believe
all you want is the truth.

14:36.151 --> 14:38.051
All you want is to find out
who really killed Molly Ryan

14:38.086 --> 14:39.819
and to bring them to justice.

14:39.855 --> 14:41.254
And if you found out you'd made
a terrible mistake

14:41.289 --> 14:43.089
in arresting Grace,
you'd want to make it right.

14:43.125 --> 14:44.190
- Natalie.
- Please, just listen.

14:44.226 --> 14:45.574
There was a witness.

14:45.610 --> 14:47.026
Someone saw Molly Ryan's killer

14:47.062 --> 14:48.995
standing over her body
holding the knife.

14:49.030 --> 14:50.311
And it wasn't Grace.

14:51.264 --> 14:54.200
You know, we canvassed
that whole area, but you,

14:54.236 --> 14:56.970
you just find a witness, don't you?

14:57.005 --> 14:58.938
I cannot protect you

14:58.974 --> 15:00.140
if you're gonna keep on tampering

15:00.175 --> 15:01.741
with the investigation.

15:01.777 --> 15:02.902
I'm not tampering.

15:03.178 --> 15:05.211
And I didn't coerce the
witness's statement in any way.

15:05.813 --> 15:07.080
He saw the killer.

15:07.115 --> 15:08.768
I just need your help
to corroborate his story.

15:08.803 --> 15:11.303
Who? Who saw the killer?

15:13.155 --> 15:14.921
Neville Harris.

15:14.956 --> 15:16.756
Neville Harris?

15:16.792 --> 15:19.926
Neville Harris is
in a psych ward, Natalie.

15:20.272 --> 15:21.895
He probably just wants your attention.

15:21.930 --> 15:23.062
What is wrong with you?

15:23.098 --> 15:24.898
Maybe, but I don't think so.

15:24.933 --> 15:26.232
You know Neville watched Molly
all the time.

15:26.268 --> 15:28.649
He was watching her that night.

15:29.171 --> 15:30.770
He didn't just see the killer.

15:30.806 --> 15:31.827
He saw his car.

15:32.240 --> 15:34.026
He got the license plate.

15:34.943 --> 15:36.976
I'm worried that if I put in

15:37.012 --> 15:38.211
an official request
for information on that plate,

15:38.246 --> 15:39.946
the owner will find out.

15:39.981 --> 15:41.181
That he'll have the chance
to bury everything

15:41.216 --> 15:42.593
before I can nail him.

15:42.975 --> 15:45.885
But you could run the plate
on the down-low.

15:45.921 --> 15:47.821
Just see if it matches up
to the name Neville gave me.

15:48.990 --> 15:50.780
Neville gave you a name, did he?

15:53.228 --> 15:55.261
Go on, then. Who is it?

15:57.866 --> 15:59.065
Prince Theo.

16:01.236 --> 16:03.169
It's not as crazy as it sounds.

16:03.205 --> 16:04.938
Prince Theo is exactly
the kind of client

16:04.973 --> 16:06.139
The Courtenay caters to.

16:06.174 --> 16:08.174
Molly could have met him there.

16:08.210 --> 16:10.109
Neville saw Prince Theo standing
over Molly Ryan's body

16:10.145 --> 16:11.845
with a knife in his hand, did he?

16:11.880 --> 16:12.879
Neville might be obsessive,

16:12.914 --> 16:14.619
but he's not delusional.

16:15.183 --> 16:17.016
Just run the plate.

16:17.052 --> 16:18.675
That's all I'm asking.

16:22.257 --> 16:24.090
Yeah, I will look into this.

16:24.125 --> 16:25.533
Thank you.

16:25.961 --> 16:27.907
I mean, I know Neville's
not making it up.

16:27.942 --> 16:29.882
I just think that probably
we should keep this quiet

16:29.917 --> 16:31.164
till I get back to you, all right?

16:31.199 --> 16:32.799
Yeah, of course.

16:35.517 --> 16:36.806
Thank you.

16:55.123 --> 16:56.789
I need to speak with Declan.

16:59.925 --> 17:01.928
It's been a long time, Patrick.

17:02.493 --> 17:04.557
What's 15 years between cousins?

17:08.103 --> 17:10.103
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:10.137 --> 17:13.138
Did you think this was gonna be
a happy reunion?

17:20.071 --> 17:22.372
Takes some stones, coming to see me

17:22.407 --> 17:24.375
after you turned your back
on our family.

17:25.109 --> 17:27.077
At least I stayed in Belfast.

17:27.112 --> 17:28.311
Well, I had to leave.

17:28.347 --> 17:30.592
To carry on in my father's name.

17:31.712 --> 17:32.938
As you should've.

17:32.973 --> 17:34.518
And look at what happened
to our fathers...

17:34.553 --> 17:36.420
yours dead, mine in prison.

17:36.455 --> 17:38.355
I couldn't start bombing cars.

17:38.390 --> 17:40.324
- I had Molly to look after.
- Oh, aye.

17:40.359 --> 17:42.192
And how'd that turn out?

17:48.367 --> 17:49.533
No offense meant.

17:49.568 --> 17:51.781
I never had nothing against your sister.

17:54.316 --> 17:55.760
She was a good girl.

17:56.657 --> 17:58.141
I'm not here to talk about Molly.

17:58.177 --> 17:59.243
Then tell me,

18:00.208 --> 18:01.920
what are you here for?

18:05.991 --> 18:09.159
I know a way to finish
what our fathers started;

18:09.617 --> 18:11.455
to remind England
that we haven't forgotten

18:11.490 --> 18:13.190
everything the Crown's taken from us.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.007
How?

18:18.137 --> 18:19.568
With blood.

18:35.462 --> 18:37.063
I'll be right outside.

18:49.254 --> 18:50.525
Charlotte.

18:52.398 --> 18:53.599
I know you're upset,

18:54.500 --> 18:56.400
but what happened last night
can never happen again.

18:56.435 --> 18:57.920
Or what?

18:58.697 --> 19:00.964
You'll kill me
like you killed Molly Ryan?

19:05.270 --> 19:06.443
I didn't kill her.

19:06.814 --> 19:07.958
I swear.

19:08.527 --> 19:09.805
But you knew her?

19:12.175 --> 19:13.083
Yes.

19:14.543 --> 19:16.086
Through The Courtenay.

19:18.324 --> 19:20.703
The "one secret thing
you kept for yourself."

19:21.952 --> 19:23.327
You could have any woman.

19:23.843 --> 19:25.495
Why pay for a whore?

19:25.531 --> 19:28.398
Because I could have anyone else.

19:28.434 --> 19:30.334
But I shouldn't have her.

19:32.538 --> 19:34.504
No, I... sorry, no.

19:34.540 --> 19:36.340
No, Charlotte, please, don't.
Char... don't.

19:36.375 --> 19:37.774
Charlotte, don't, don't do that.

19:38.444 --> 19:40.510
Why would I want to marry you?

19:40.546 --> 19:42.141
So you can cheat on me again?

19:42.177 --> 19:43.169
I wouldn't do that to you.

19:43.204 --> 19:45.515
Listen to what you just said, Theo.

19:45.551 --> 19:47.351
You want what you can't have.

19:47.804 --> 19:49.286
What happens after we're married?

19:49.723 --> 19:51.537
When you can have me anytime you like?

19:51.572 --> 19:53.323
Well, then I'll want you even more.

19:53.359 --> 19:54.789
Molly was an escape,

19:55.194 --> 19:57.461
but with you in my life,
I don't want to escape anymore.

19:57.757 --> 19:59.574
I love you, Charlotte.

20:00.165 --> 20:02.036
I have since the day I surprised you

20:02.071 --> 20:03.500
at your parents' house.
Do you remember that?

20:05.170 --> 20:06.723
You were in the garden, hmm?

20:06.758 --> 20:08.338
You were, you were elbow deep in dirt,

20:08.374 --> 20:09.473
and wearing your dad's old work shirt.

20:10.284 --> 20:11.307
You didn't know I was there at first,

20:11.343 --> 20:14.177
so I, I watched you working for a while.

20:14.610 --> 20:17.819
You were singing along to some
terrible pop song on the radio.

20:17.854 --> 20:20.550
And you had this enormous
smile on your face.

20:21.623 --> 20:23.119
And it wasn't because you,

20:23.155 --> 20:25.616
you had to try and present
some perfect image.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.037
It's because you were happy.

20:27.073 --> 20:30.360
Just... genuinely happy.

20:30.913 --> 20:33.894
And your happiness is-is infectious.

20:33.929 --> 20:36.466
It's like some warm glow
that has transferred to me.

20:36.502 --> 20:39.236
And I have never felt this way before.

20:40.606 --> 20:41.996
With anyone.

20:43.471 --> 20:46.143
Don't make me live without you.

20:46.178 --> 20:47.498
Please.

20:53.776 --> 20:55.495
Lie to me again,

20:56.455 --> 20:57.681
and I'll leave.

20:58.658 --> 21:01.258
And I will make sure the whole world

21:01.593 --> 21:03.008
knows why.

21:14.239 --> 21:15.505
Mm-hmm, yeah.

21:15.874 --> 21:16.813
Yeah.

21:17.443 --> 21:19.209
I'll make sure your divorce lawyer

21:19.244 --> 21:21.077
has a copy of the next
article in the series

21:21.113 --> 21:22.116
as soon as it runs.

21:22.151 --> 21:23.609
Yeah, all right.

21:24.550 --> 21:26.082
Eat up.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.662
We got a lot of work ahead of us.

21:27.687 --> 21:28.946
You're gonna need your strength.

21:29.421 --> 21:30.520
Meat is murder.

21:30.556 --> 21:32.456
Murder is my business, sweetheart.

21:32.491 --> 21:34.458
Business must be bad
if you've come to me again.

21:34.493 --> 21:36.259
Didn't The Courtenay story

21:36.295 --> 21:38.328
I ran for you blow your
field of suspects wide open?

21:38.363 --> 21:41.398
Let's not pretend you ran
that for little ol' me.

21:41.433 --> 21:43.789
Before that story, @VeenaPatel

21:43.824 --> 21:45.502
was a nobody in the Twittersphere.

21:45.537 --> 21:47.050
And now, yes, you're finally

21:47.085 --> 21:49.473
on the map, and, no...
thank you for asking...

21:49.508 --> 21:52.275
things have not blown up
as big as I would've liked.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.477
I need names.

21:53.512 --> 21:55.345
I need salacious detail.

21:55.380 --> 21:56.580
I need you to find out

21:56.615 --> 21:58.381
everything you can about Molly Ryan's

21:58.417 --> 21:59.416
clients up till now.

21:59.451 --> 22:01.284
I don't have to share a thing with you.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.220
- We aren't partners.
- No.

22:03.255 --> 22:04.287
But I thought we might have

22:04.323 --> 22:06.289
a mentor/mentee kind of thing going.

22:06.325 --> 22:07.763
I'm not trying to be a lawyer.

22:07.788 --> 22:09.556
No, you're trying to be famous.

22:09.581 --> 22:12.062
And I know a thing or two
about that as well.

22:12.428 --> 22:15.232
Are you going to teach me
how to take a wee

22:15.267 --> 22:16.399
on someone's supper?

22:16.435 --> 22:18.268
I'll pass.

22:18.303 --> 22:21.137
But you're welcome to read all
about those Courtenay clients

22:21.173 --> 22:22.758
when I expose them in my

22:22.783 --> 22:25.108
award-winning multi-part series.

22:25.143 --> 22:28.111
So you don't value
my guidance and wisdom,

22:28.146 --> 22:30.313
then how about something
a little bit more concrete?

22:30.349 --> 22:32.449
Team Grace will give Veena Patel

22:32.484 --> 22:35.118
an exclusive on all media interactions

22:35.153 --> 22:36.319
throughout trial.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.328
Everyone who's ever heard of Twitter

22:38.363 --> 22:39.523
will be following you.

22:39.558 --> 22:41.842
# YoureTrending.

22:44.463 --> 22:46.931
Where are you now, Grace?

22:47.963 --> 22:49.533
I'm back at the flat.

23:04.116 --> 23:05.348
Hey, there you are.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.506
What are you doing, hiding in here?

23:07.759 --> 23:09.386
You're missing all the fun.

23:09.421 --> 23:10.520
We know how to have fun.

23:10.556 --> 23:12.490
Don't we, Luc?

23:17.229 --> 23:18.747
What the hell, Molly?!

23:18.772 --> 23:20.130
Hey, relax, Grace.

23:20.165 --> 23:21.264
It doesn't mean anything.

23:23.302 --> 23:24.691
Yeah?

23:24.777 --> 23:27.370
What about the lap dance...
did that mean anything?

23:27.406 --> 23:29.506
I had a crap day.
I needed to blow off some steam.

23:29.541 --> 23:32.140
Then grind away the pain
on somebody else's boyfriend!

23:32.165 --> 23:35.111
What's the matter, Grace,
was he enjoying it too much?

23:43.155 --> 23:44.220
<i>Grace?</i>

23:44.682 --> 23:45.455
<i>You're shaking.</i>

23:45.490 --> 23:47.157
<i>What's happening?</i>

23:48.066 --> 23:48.976
I'm scared.

23:49.494 --> 23:50.814
Why?

23:53.131 --> 23:55.565
Because I hated Molly
so much in that moment.

23:55.601 --> 23:58.014
I wanted her to die.

24:00.833 --> 24:02.097
I just need you to help

24:02.124 --> 24:03.423
me get to him, that's all.

24:03.458 --> 24:05.191
Look, I don't understand what
you're asking me to do here.

24:05.227 --> 24:06.359
You're the prince's special girl now.

24:06.428 --> 24:07.816
Just figure out a way to get him alone.

24:08.277 --> 24:09.721
Wh... I'm done with all that.

24:09.757 --> 24:11.297
Besides, The Courtenay's closed.

24:11.333 --> 24:12.532
I wouldn't even know how to reach him.

24:12.980 --> 24:14.167
I bet Roz would.

24:14.202 --> 24:15.335
Oh, my God.

24:15.370 --> 24:17.679
Listen, I don't want
any more blood on my hands!

24:17.714 --> 24:19.372
- He's gonna get away with it.
- No, he's not.

24:19.408 --> 24:21.441
Okay, we'll-we'll go to the authorities.

24:21.476 --> 24:23.443
Two Northern Irish
accusing a royal of murder?

24:23.478 --> 24:24.477
- They're never gonna believe us.
- Then I'll make them.

24:24.513 --> 24:26.279
Okay? I'll tell anyone who will listen.

24:26.314 --> 24:28.853
So they can call you a whore
like they did my sister?

24:31.887 --> 24:33.520
Look, okay?

24:34.383 --> 24:35.388
If that's what it takes to stop you

24:35.424 --> 24:38.558
from getting yourself in trouble
or worse, then yes.

24:40.162 --> 24:41.361
Yes.

24:44.166 --> 24:46.366
Molly needs me to see this through.

24:49.827 --> 24:51.504
Look at me.

24:52.071 --> 24:53.439
You think more death is what she'd want?

24:54.556 --> 24:56.677
No, she'd want you just
to get on with your life.

24:57.179 --> 24:59.412
You go after the prince
and what? Maybe...

24:59.448 --> 25:02.115
maybe you get him, but then what, hmm?

25:03.627 --> 25:04.885
What happens to you?

25:06.101 --> 25:07.461
I don't matter.

25:10.861 --> 25:12.133
Yes, you do.

25:29.882 --> 25:30.768
James?

25:30.915 --> 25:32.058
Can I come in?

25:33.248 --> 25:35.248
We finally got a break in Grace's case.

25:35.283 --> 25:37.250
I've been trying to call you,
but your phone says

25:37.285 --> 25:39.519
- it's disconnected.
- Yeah, I tossed it.

25:40.369 --> 25:41.838
What's going on, James?

25:41.874 --> 25:44.390
Uh, I've, uh, made

25:44.426 --> 25:46.326
some mistakes in my business,

25:46.813 --> 25:48.560
gotten involved with some
people I shouldn't have.

25:48.597 --> 25:51.164
But, uh, the less you know, the better.

25:51.199 --> 25:52.432
Why are you telling me this now?

25:52.467 --> 25:53.724
Because I have to leave.

25:54.202 --> 25:56.302
- You're leaving?
- I know it's the worst possible

25:56.338 --> 25:58.758
time to abandon Grace... to abandon you,

25:59.525 --> 26:00.970
but I can't stay in London.

26:01.006 --> 26:02.375
I... It's not safe for me here.

26:02.410 --> 26:04.210
But I don't even care about that.

26:04.246 --> 26:06.279
I don't, I don't want
to endanger you girls.

26:07.076 --> 26:08.247
How long are you gonna be gone?

26:08.283 --> 26:09.482
I don't know.

26:11.286 --> 26:13.119
Uh, look, you don't have to worry.

26:13.155 --> 26:15.221
You're both gonna be taken care of.

26:15.257 --> 26:17.223
The one good thing about my dealings

26:17.259 --> 26:19.526
with these people
is that I'm flush again.

26:19.561 --> 26:22.428
So I've set up a trust
for you and Grace.

26:22.464 --> 26:24.443
Gutterie has all the details.

26:25.733 --> 26:28.134
Is there any way we'll be
able to contact you?

26:28.683 --> 26:30.628
No, it's best that way.

26:30.835 --> 26:32.272
Grace will be devastated.

26:32.307 --> 26:33.573
She'll want to talk to you.

26:34.047 --> 26:35.196
I know...

26:36.428 --> 26:37.668
and it's killing me.

26:38.700 --> 26:41.446
My only comfort is that,
uh, she still has you.

26:44.452 --> 26:46.518
I need you to know something, Natalie.

26:48.706 --> 26:50.156
I loved your mom.

26:50.812 --> 26:52.524
I love Grace.

26:53.028 --> 26:55.461
And despite what you think,

26:56.308 --> 26:58.198
I've always loved you.

27:30.332 --> 27:32.265
Son of a bitch.

27:39.374 --> 27:40.440
Please tell me you got some good news.

27:40.475 --> 27:42.342
Meet me at my flat in a hour.

27:42.377 --> 27:43.509
Take the back stairs.

27:43.545 --> 27:45.445
Make sure you're not followed.

28:57.958 --> 28:59.435
What do you want with my boy?

29:00.170 --> 29:01.049
Mrs. Harris?

29:01.084 --> 29:02.727
I saw your name in the visitors log.

29:02.762 --> 29:04.110
Why are you bothering Neville?

29:04.135 --> 29:05.797
I had some questions for him.

29:05.832 --> 29:07.477
Neville was very brave.

29:07.512 --> 29:08.566
He told me what he saw.

29:08.602 --> 29:10.835
Isn't it bad enough
you sent my son to hospital?

29:10.870 --> 29:12.837
And now you want
to drag him back into this?

29:12.872 --> 29:15.873
Well, he has information
that's vital to Grace's defense.

29:15.909 --> 29:18.643
My son is sick.

29:18.678 --> 29:19.877
And this is too much for him!

29:19.913 --> 29:21.713
The-the stress, the pressure...

29:21.748 --> 29:22.847
Mrs. Harris, I don't want
to hurt Neville.

29:22.882 --> 29:24.769
I just want him to tell the truth.

29:24.794 --> 29:26.173
You just want to use him.

29:26.209 --> 29:27.885
And you don't care what it costs him.

29:27.921 --> 29:30.021
- Now, that's not true.
- Well, I won't let you.

29:30.056 --> 29:31.889
I'm not gonna let Neville
have anything more to do

29:31.925 --> 29:34.626
with you or that case. Do you hear me?

29:37.864 --> 29:39.908
I'm sorry, but Neville's an adult.

29:41.034 --> 29:42.458
It's his decision.

29:42.483 --> 29:44.669
Look, please.

29:44.704 --> 29:46.838
Just leave my son alone.

29:46.873 --> 29:48.384
You have no idea what he's been through.

29:48.420 --> 29:49.625
He needs help.

29:49.660 --> 29:50.642
So does Grace.

29:50.677 --> 29:53.044
Look, to everyone else
Neville might be an adult.

29:53.857 --> 29:55.045
But inside, he...

29:55.081 --> 29:56.881
he's still a child.

29:57.535 --> 29:58.850
He's not like other boys.

29:58.885 --> 30:00.479
But he wants to be.

30:00.854 --> 30:02.778
He wants to help someone.

30:03.405 --> 30:05.313
To feel good about himself.

30:05.992 --> 30:08.181
Let him have that chance.

30:11.698 --> 30:13.865
But you best not mess this up.

30:27.814 --> 30:29.914
That's a pretty pricey pad

30:29.949 --> 30:31.683
for a cub reporter.

30:31.718 --> 30:33.215
Not when you have three jobs.

30:33.796 --> 30:35.620
I'm a reporter by day,

30:35.655 --> 30:37.088
a social media consultant by night,

30:37.123 --> 30:39.824
and a dog walker on the weekends.

30:39.859 --> 30:41.726
Your mom must be very proud
of your hard work.

30:41.761 --> 30:43.154
So long as I don't call home

30:43.190 --> 30:45.105
for money, she's pleased as punch.

30:45.650 --> 30:48.933
Look, before you get any funny ideas,

30:48.968 --> 30:52.804
you should know that my walls
are thin, and I scream loud.

30:53.040 --> 30:55.972
Don't worry, the only woman
whose skirt I intend to lift

30:56.009 --> 30:57.709
is Lady Justice.

30:57.744 --> 31:00.303
Well, let the peep show begin.

31:07.176 --> 31:08.261
Where did you get all this?

31:08.296 --> 31:09.654
Since my story broke,

31:09.689 --> 31:12.724
I've gotten loads of calls
from Courtenay ex-employees.

31:12.759 --> 31:14.592
Now that they're not
getting paid by these perverts,

31:14.627 --> 31:16.986
they're happy to out them, for a price.

31:17.011 --> 31:19.030
And you put
all the puzzle pieces together.

31:23.737 --> 31:25.010
What do we have here?

31:26.561 --> 31:28.706
George Zaveri's alibied out.

31:28.742 --> 31:31.609
I thought you were here
for potential suspects?

31:31.644 --> 31:33.778
You may have just given me
something better.

31:33.813 --> 31:35.747
Can I keep this? Thanks.

31:36.983 --> 31:39.650
Do I still get my exclusives?

31:56.136 --> 31:57.769
Oh, Luc.

31:58.347 --> 31:59.771
What do you want, Roz?

32:01.941 --> 32:04.580
I need a place to crash for a while.

32:05.645 --> 32:07.529
I don't suppose
I have a say in the matter.

32:07.565 --> 32:09.881
I guess you've forgotten
who pulled you off the street,

32:09.916 --> 32:11.883
- cleaned you up, gave you a job.
- Yeah.

32:11.918 --> 32:13.718
Working at The Courtenay.

32:13.753 --> 32:15.720
That was a real step up in the world.

32:15.755 --> 32:17.822
Why does everyone act like
what happens to them

32:17.857 --> 32:19.791
at The Courtenay is my fault?

32:19.826 --> 32:22.827
I never pretended it was
anything other than what it was.

32:22.862 --> 32:26.063
It was the money
that seduced you, not me.

32:26.099 --> 32:28.032
You don't give yourself
enough credit, Roz.

32:30.393 --> 32:31.668
So what now?

32:32.719 --> 32:34.005
You're just gonna slowly kill yourself

32:34.040 --> 32:35.773
as a penance for Grace?

32:35.809 --> 32:37.347
You have any better ideas?

32:52.725 --> 32:55.059
Natalie, I told you
to take the back stairs.

33:04.037 --> 33:06.062
To what do I owe this honor?

33:08.278 --> 33:09.906
You tried to frame me.

33:14.440 --> 33:16.681
Well, you wanted me
to frame someone, didn't you?

33:16.716 --> 33:18.049
Seemed a shame to bring

33:18.084 --> 33:19.851
a third party into this,
after I found out

33:19.886 --> 33:21.112
that you were the killer.

33:21.827 --> 33:22.953
What are you talking about?

33:22.989 --> 33:24.755
I've got a witness, Your Highness.

33:26.025 --> 33:28.239
He saw you kill Molly Ryan.

33:30.930 --> 33:31.963
Why would I kill Molly?

33:32.787 --> 33:33.931
I loved her.

33:34.185 --> 33:36.066
I have from the moment
I met her in Hertfordshire.

33:36.102 --> 33:39.187
Almost sounds convincing.
Have you been practicing that?

33:42.317 --> 33:43.674
You leave me no choice, Detective,

33:43.710 --> 33:44.709
but to inform Internal Affairs

33:44.744 --> 33:46.644
about how you planted evidence

33:46.679 --> 33:47.945
on Donovan Trimbly.

33:47.981 --> 33:49.614
I mean, you're in for
quite the fall, Detective.

33:49.649 --> 33:50.715
That's fine.

33:50.750 --> 33:52.615
Really, because on the way down,

33:52.650 --> 33:54.085
I'm gonna tell everyone

33:54.120 --> 33:56.988
- what you made me do.
- What I made you do?!

33:57.023 --> 33:59.790
Phillip, have I ever met
a D.S. Alex Bruno before?

33:59.826 --> 34:01.453
Doesn't ring a bell, Your Highness.

34:01.489 --> 34:02.693
But I did hear about some copper

34:02.729 --> 34:04.829
from Homicide stealing knickers

34:04.864 --> 34:05.863
from evidence.

34:05.899 --> 34:06.931
You think that was him?

34:06.966 --> 34:09.800
Definitely. Yeah.

34:09.835 --> 34:11.768
I heard the same detective

34:11.804 --> 34:13.737
violated Molly Ryan's dead body

34:13.773 --> 34:15.940
so he could steal her blood

34:15.975 --> 34:18.042
and frame someone else for the murder,

34:18.077 --> 34:21.612
while he shagged
the prime suspect's sister.

34:24.984 --> 34:26.650
Do you want to hit me?

34:27.786 --> 34:29.687
Come on, then.

34:32.692 --> 34:34.792
That's what I thought.

34:49.943 --> 34:52.009
Alex.

35:00.738 --> 35:01.704
<i>Natalie, please.</i>

35:01.718 --> 35:03.251
I can't believe I ever trusted you.

35:03.286 --> 35:04.319
No, no, no, listen to me.

35:04.354 --> 35:05.760
Listen. I can explain this.

35:05.785 --> 35:07.758
No, you-you don't get to touch me,

35:08.298 --> 35:09.681
not ever again.

35:09.725 --> 35:12.100
Okay, look, I thought that
I was just covering up

35:12.135 --> 35:14.436
a sex scandal, okay, not a murderer.

35:15.050 --> 35:16.882
For Queen and Country, right?

35:16.917 --> 35:19.160
He had a gun to my head, Nat.

35:19.196 --> 35:21.107
If they'd have told IA what I'd done,

35:21.143 --> 35:23.478
a child killer
would've gone free, dozens,

35:23.513 --> 35:25.080
dozens of convictions overturned.

35:25.115 --> 35:26.804
Because you planted evidence.

35:26.890 --> 35:28.450
And you've been protecting a murderer

35:28.485 --> 35:30.185
while my sister's been railroaded!

35:30.220 --> 35:31.065
I'm trying to make it right now.

35:31.100 --> 35:32.660
By planting evidence again?

35:32.933 --> 35:35.967
You had the nerve
to lecture me on ethics.

35:36.442 --> 35:38.106
And I listened to you.

35:39.779 --> 35:41.746
I almost turned my back
on my own sister.

35:41.771 --> 35:44.005
- Yeah, well, the evidence was...
- Irrelevant!

35:45.892 --> 35:47.992
The truth was staring you
right in the face,

35:48.017 --> 35:50.818
but you were too worried about
saving your own ass to see it.

35:59.192 --> 36:01.192
I know it's been a long day, Grace,

36:01.228 --> 36:02.683
but we're making progress.

36:03.656 --> 36:05.096
Where are you?

36:06.562 --> 36:07.859
I'm...

36:08.168 --> 36:09.267
I'm in the bathroom.

36:09.303 --> 36:11.202
<i>This must've been</i>

36:11.238 --> 36:13.271
<i>when I came down from the roof.</i>

36:19.179 --> 36:21.313
I don't want to open the door.

36:21.348 --> 36:22.881
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

36:22.916 --> 36:23.948
<i>It's okay to face it.</i>

36:23.984 --> 36:25.083
<i>You're completely safe.</i>

36:28.355 --> 36:30.385
<i>I'm in the laundry room now.</i>

36:46.039 --> 36:47.339
<i>Molly's...</i>

36:50.604 --> 36:51.682
She's dead.

36:51.717 --> 36:54.045
<i>Tell me what else you see.</i>

36:54.081 --> 36:55.947
<i>There's a knife in her stomach.</i>

36:57.217 --> 36:59.050
There's blood under my feet.

37:03.838 --> 37:05.323
I just left her there.

37:05.719 --> 37:06.958
On the floor.

37:06.993 --> 37:09.127
<i>Like I hadn't even seen her.</i>

37:15.697 --> 37:16.868
Wait.

37:19.522 --> 37:21.139
Oh, my God.

37:21.174 --> 37:22.240
Grace?

37:22.275 --> 37:23.521
What is it?

37:24.526 --> 37:26.181
I see someone.

37:26.913 --> 37:28.146
<i>Who is it?</i>

37:28.181 --> 37:30.181
<i>A man, I think.</i>

37:30.217 --> 37:32.016
<i>I can't see his face.</i>

37:32.052 --> 37:33.351
<i>His back is to me,</i>

37:33.387 --> 37:35.920
<i>but his clothes are covered in blood.</i>

37:41.928 --> 37:43.652
I didn't kill Molly.

37:59.846 --> 38:01.246
Put me on the stand.

38:01.281 --> 38:03.114
I want to testify against Prince Theo.

38:11.291 --> 38:14.859
Dr. Caldwell said
that I-I-I disassociated

38:14.895 --> 38:17.962
when I saw her body like that.

38:17.998 --> 38:20.136
That's why I couldn't remember.

38:20.901 --> 38:22.167
Yeah, that makes sense.

38:24.037 --> 38:26.938
I'm just sorry you had to go back there.

38:27.457 --> 38:28.887
At least now I know.

38:29.976 --> 38:31.436
We all do.

38:35.048 --> 38:37.148
Hey, does Stan know

38:37.184 --> 38:38.730
about Detective Bruno

38:38.766 --> 38:40.852
- and the prince?
- Hell, yes, he does.

38:40.887 --> 38:42.287
We've got everything we need

38:42.322 --> 38:43.745
to get you out of here now.

38:44.090 --> 38:46.090
Your memory, Neville's testimony,

38:46.126 --> 38:47.483
the police cover-up.

38:47.550 --> 38:48.892
We're gonna win.

38:50.285 --> 38:51.971
I'm gonna take you home.

39:06.513 --> 39:07.512
Care for a drink?

39:13.987 --> 39:15.086
Oh, this'll do.

39:17.122 --> 39:19.123
Are you sure you have
the stones for this?

39:19.639 --> 39:21.292
He killed my sister.

39:36.243 --> 39:37.751
Madam Prosecutor.

39:38.899 --> 39:40.800
Well, you look like
you've been stood up.

39:40.836 --> 39:43.146
Just savoring the calm before the storm.

39:43.181 --> 39:44.773
What, in that get-up?

39:44.808 --> 39:46.055
Geez, you take me-time

39:46.090 --> 39:47.560
far more seriously than I do.

39:47.596 --> 39:49.201
Can we get two of the same?

39:49.990 --> 39:52.056
You're not here looking
for a plea deal, are you?

39:52.092 --> 39:55.260
What, and miss the opportunity
to spar with you in court?

39:55.295 --> 39:57.506
Please, where would the fun be in that?

39:57.964 --> 39:59.247
You haven't heard.

39:59.966 --> 40:01.299
Judge Manning doesn't put up
with much fun

40:01.334 --> 40:03.101
- in her courtroom.
- It is so funny

40:03.136 --> 40:05.601
that you should mention
the Honorable Constance Manning.

40:05.636 --> 40:08.072
- And why is that?
- Haven't you heard?

40:08.618 --> 40:10.341
She's, uh, recused herself

40:10.377 --> 40:11.654
from the case.

40:12.145 --> 40:13.211
Mm.

40:13.541 --> 40:15.179
As it turns out, her husband

40:15.215 --> 40:18.016
George Zaveri, was a client of...

40:18.051 --> 40:19.250
drumroll please...

40:19.286 --> 40:20.407
The Courtenay.

40:21.054 --> 40:22.086
Now how about that?

40:22.122 --> 40:23.187
I'm sure you played your part

40:23.223 --> 40:24.289
in helping Judge Manning

40:24.324 --> 40:26.190
make that unpleasant discovery.

40:26.686 --> 40:28.141
But I don't care.

40:28.555 --> 40:30.295
Whatever tricks you have up your sleeve,

40:30.330 --> 40:32.559
there's nothing compared
to what I have on my side.

40:33.226 --> 40:34.614
Truth.

40:35.488 --> 40:37.135
You know, just between you and me,

40:37.170 --> 40:38.937
I am not always the biggest fan

40:38.972 --> 40:41.039
of the truth coming out at trial.

40:41.074 --> 40:43.107
But for once,

40:43.143 --> 40:45.376
I am really looking forward to it.

40:48.122 --> 40:49.820
To the truth.
