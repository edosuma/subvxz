00:06.313 --> 00:09.447
There's this thing that can kill people.

00:09.448 --> 00:12.576
I felt like I was being electrocuted.

00:12.577 --> 00:14.780
Screaming in pain.

00:14.781 --> 00:16.431
I heard a little girl scream.

00:16.432 --> 00:18.637
You hear a scream like that,
you gotta be concerned.

00:18.638 --> 00:21.201
Creepy little kids.

00:21.202 --> 00:22.506
Dark times for the family.

00:22.507 --> 00:25.280
He would like to kill them.

00:25.281 --> 00:28.190
Either there's something in this
house or I'm losing my mind.

00:28.191 --> 00:28.970
It attacked.

00:28.971 --> 00:32.115
This thing likes death.

00:32.116 --> 00:35.296
I don't like it here.

00:36.260 --> 00:38.349
There's something down there.

00:38.350 --> 00:41.470
My name is Amy Allan.

00:42.279 --> 00:44.592
A lot of dead people are here.

00:44.593 --> 00:45.715
I see dead people.

00:45.716 --> 00:47.380
This is not good.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.537
I speak to dead people..

00:49.538 --> 00:51.111
He is very pissed off.

00:51.112 --> 00:52.712
And they speak to me..

00:52.713 --> 00:54.055
The house is angry.

00:54.056 --> 00:57.488
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:57.489 --> 00:59.337
He's killed people.

00:59.338 --> 01:00.711
I rely on my partner.

01:00.712 --> 01:02.145
I'm Steve Dischiavi.

01:02.146 --> 01:04.224
I'm a retired New York
City homicide Detective..

01:04.226 --> 01:05.716
He got shot at his house?

01:05.717 --> 01:08.654
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:08.655 --> 01:10.081
Aren't you terrified being here?

01:10.082 --> 01:11.366
It's my job to reveal them.

01:11.367 --> 01:13.436
That sounds like something
out of "The Exorcist."

01:13.437 --> 01:15.554
But Steve and I never speak..

01:15.555 --> 01:17.538
We never communicate
during an investigation..

01:17.539 --> 01:18.907
Until the very end..

01:18.908 --> 01:20.195
It's bad.

01:20.196 --> 01:22.368
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay..

01:22.369 --> 01:23.677
I'd like some answers.

01:23.678 --> 01:26.678
Or time to get out.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.074

01:47.846 --> 01:52.583
When Amy and I work a case,
we do it independently.

01:52.584 --> 01:54.490
I interview the witnesses
and then go to work

02:05.144 --> 02:07.350
I'm down in Uriah, Alabama.

02:07.351 --> 02:10.716
It's a small town about an
hour outside of Mobile.

02:10.717 --> 02:13.892
Amy and I were called in
by a woman named Robin.

02:13.893 --> 02:17.643
She never believed in the paranormal
till she moved into her dream home.

02:17.644 --> 02:19.362
Now she believes.

02:19.363 --> 02:21.745
She also believes her life is in danger.

02:21.746 --> 02:26.486
I'm gonna try to find out what's going on.

02:31.631 --> 02:34.634
Names and faces can distract
Amy during her walk..

02:34.635 --> 02:40.248
So I need to inspect the house before she
arrives and remove any personal items

02:40.249 --> 02:44.149
that could influence her findings.

03:06.907 --> 03:08.855
As I approach this location,

03:08.856 --> 03:14.496
I'm already picking up on
flashes of death in the area.

03:15.414 --> 03:20.574
Whatever entities are here,
feel extremely powerful.

03:34.320 --> 03:37.021
I'm just a little nervous because..

03:37.022 --> 03:39.891
There were, like, two men that I got.

03:39.892 --> 03:41.033
And, um..

03:41.034 --> 03:44.634
They're both kind of freaky.

03:45.392 --> 03:48.151
One's completely cr.. Insane..

03:48.152 --> 03:54.052
And then the other one is really quiet
but he's much more powerful and bad.

03:54.422 --> 03:58.682
I also did see the word "poltergeist."

04:22.945 --> 04:25.431
Pretty much since we bought this place..

04:25.432 --> 04:28.196
You know, strange things
have started happening.

04:28.197 --> 04:34.097
I've seen and heard a few things, but
recently, I was physically attacked.

04:34.510 --> 04:38.201
And I can't explain it away in my head.

04:38.202 --> 04:40.989
I've renovated a lot of old houses..

04:40.990 --> 04:45.792
And I've never had any kind
of strange experiences.

04:45.793 --> 04:48.057
So, Robin, you never believed
in the paranormal before.

04:48.058 --> 04:49.896
- But you do now?
- Yes.

04:49.897 --> 04:51.452
Why not just move?

04:51.453 --> 04:53.195
It's not really an option for us.

04:53.196 --> 04:55.941
You know, we've..
We've put our life savings into this place.

04:55.942 --> 05:01.282
And, you know, there's
really nowhere for us to go.

05:11.745 --> 05:14.316
The moment I opened to
communicate with the dead..

05:14.317 --> 05:18.929
An entity started flooding
my mind with violent images.

05:18.930 --> 05:22.304
There's, like, definitely, um..

05:22.305 --> 05:25.305
Something really bad.

05:26.950 --> 05:29.100
Everybody's on alert.

05:29.101 --> 05:31.141
They're nervous for me.

05:31.142 --> 05:32.890
Who's "everybody"?

05:32.891 --> 05:35.291
Dead people.

05:35.567 --> 05:37.327
I don't like it here.

05:37.328 --> 05:39.118
What's wrong?

05:39.119 --> 05:39.846
You okay?

05:39.847 --> 05:42.745
Yeah. I don't like this other guy, though.

05:42.746 --> 05:44.842
Whatever is here is evil..

05:44.843 --> 05:48.463
And it wants me out of this house.

05:48.464 --> 05:51.982
He doesn't want me here..
And he doesn't want me to talk about him

05:51.983 --> 05:57.323
and he threatened me, and
I'm kinda scared because..

06:01.298 --> 06:04.084
Because, like, I think he can,
like, really do (Bleep)..

06:04.085 --> 06:07.265
And I don't like him.

06:13.110 --> 06:14.689
So what happened here?

06:14.690 --> 06:17.706
Little over a year ago, I was
following my brother-in-law

06:17.707 --> 06:22.374
from one side of the attic to the other,
and he had just walked across a plank,

06:22.375 --> 06:24.710
and when I stepped on the
middle of the plank,

06:24.711 --> 06:27.926
it cracked, and I fell through the ceiling.

06:27.927 --> 06:31.978
You can see where it's been repaired
right there, but not painted.

06:31.979 --> 06:37.879
I fell from there all the way
to the floor and the entryway.

06:39.886 --> 06:43.562
You fell from that hole in that
ceiling all the way down to here?

06:43.563 --> 06:45.423
Yes.

06:45.674 --> 06:48.472
All the way down.

06:48.473 --> 06:50.069
That's amazing that you're not dead.

06:50.070 --> 06:53.130
I know. I should be.

06:54.156 --> 06:57.910
It crushed my pelvis, and now I..
I have to have my hip replaced.

06:57.911 --> 07:01.691
I have no idea why the board broke
on me and not a 200-pound man.

07:01.692 --> 07:03.060
- That's bizarre.
- Yeah.

07:03.061 --> 07:05.153
The 200-pound guy goes
across it, no problem.

07:05.154 --> 07:06.004
No.

07:06.005 --> 07:07.793
And then you go across,
and you fall through?

07:07.794 --> 07:08.696
Yeah.

07:08.697 --> 07:10.909
Honestly, I don't know why I survived it.

07:10.910 --> 07:16.810
I mean, I'm thankful I did, but
I really shouldn't be here.

07:17.661 --> 07:21.200
So this guy can, like, kill people.

07:21.201 --> 07:23.649
- How?
- Strangle them..

07:23.650 --> 07:26.069
Beat them, throw them down the stairs..

07:26.070 --> 07:27.675
Give them a heart attack.

07:27.676 --> 07:30.366
Anything he wants, really.

07:30.367 --> 07:33.262
Maybe it was a living person then..

07:33.263 --> 07:37.163
But it's not a person any more.

07:47.070 --> 07:48.514
So, Robin, what's going on in here?

07:48.515 --> 07:51.266
One night, uh, I was awakened..

07:51.267 --> 07:57.167
And when I looked back this way, there
was a tall, thin outline of a man.

07:57.614 --> 08:01.595
No details, just sort of,
you know, shades of gray.

08:01.596 --> 08:02.330
That's bizarre.

08:02.331 --> 08:04.238
Yeah, I don't have any
explanation for it, Steve.

08:04.239 --> 08:05.506
I'm.. I'm at a loss.

08:05.507 --> 08:06.741
It's gotta be driving you crazy.

08:06.742 --> 08:07.832
Um, actually, it is.

08:07.833 --> 08:13.733
It's either there's something in
this house or I'm losing my mind.

08:17.765 --> 08:20.945
This area is not safe.

08:22.250 --> 08:24.618
This thing, uh..

08:24.619 --> 08:27.019
Likes death.

08:29.012 --> 08:32.972
It likes.. Standing over the beds.

08:33.513 --> 08:36.080
It feels better when I move.

08:36.081 --> 08:37.881
Mm.

08:37.893 --> 08:40.472
Mm, like this.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.299
You know?

08:43.299 --> 08:46.909
And what is it doing when it does that?

08:46.910 --> 08:49.507
It tries to kill people.

08:49.508 --> 08:50.954
Does it?

08:50.955 --> 08:53.775
I think it could.

09:02.594 --> 09:07.152
What happened to me in here is
actually the reason I called you guys.

09:07.153 --> 09:11.216
I dozed off watching
television one evening..

09:11.217 --> 09:13.740
And I woke up..

09:13.741 --> 09:15.961
But when I sat up..

09:15.962 --> 09:19.881
Floating in the air above me was a gray..

09:19.882 --> 09:21.802
Mass.

09:22.480 --> 09:26.374
It kind of changed shape
and made a beeline at me.

09:26.375 --> 09:28.979
It went into my chest.

09:28.980 --> 09:30.698
The sensation was unbelievable.

09:30.699 --> 09:34.605
It took my breath, and I
felt like I was being..

09:34.606 --> 09:37.067
Electrocuted and..

09:37.068 --> 09:40.488
Frozen.. At the same time.

09:45.147 --> 09:48.034
Can the bad man make himself
known to the living?

09:48.035 --> 09:51.155
I think he can, yeah.

09:52.103 --> 09:55.643
Mm. He goes inside of them.

09:56.894 --> 10:01.094
So essentially like he possesses them?

10:07.818 --> 10:10.818
How does he feel about
the people in the house?

10:10.819 --> 10:14.659
Um, he would like to kill them.

10:31.913 --> 10:34.785
The man is very forceful.

10:34.786 --> 10:38.321
I think he can manipulate, to some
extent, how people perceive him,

10:38.322 --> 10:42.582
because they perceive what scares them.

10:42.932 --> 10:45.359
He likes to be around death.

10:45.360 --> 10:47.872
I think he makes people do..

10:47.873 --> 10:49.061
Crazy stuff.

10:49.062 --> 10:51.659
How does the bad man make people do things?

10:51.660 --> 10:53.362
Mm, he goes inside of them.

10:53.363 --> 10:57.563
So essentially like he possesses them?

11:04.347 --> 11:06.862
How does he feel about
the people in the house?

11:06.863 --> 11:10.703
Um, he would like to kill them.

11:21.512 --> 11:23.188
So, Ty, I was talking to your wife.

11:23.189 --> 11:26.918
Um, she's experiencing some pretty
bizarre things in the house.

11:26.919 --> 11:30.436
Um, how about yourself? Anything?

11:30.437 --> 11:31.760
No, I haven't..

11:31.761 --> 11:33.714
I haven't seen anything in the house.

11:33.715 --> 11:35.442
I mean, she's, you know..

11:35.443 --> 11:38.587
Tried to point some things
out to me at times..

11:38.588 --> 11:41.921
But.. Nothing. I.. I can't see it.

11:41.922 --> 11:44.862
Do you believe her?

11:45.061 --> 11:46.946
I believe she sees something.

11:46.947 --> 11:49.061
She think I think she's crazy.

11:49.062 --> 11:50.445
Okay.

11:50.446 --> 11:52.768
Is she getting angry with you?

11:52.769 --> 11:55.843
I think she..
She gets a little testy with me

11:55.844 --> 12:00.548
because she'll wake me up at night, and
I'm supposed to see what she's seeing,

12:00.549 --> 12:01.559
and I don't see it.

12:01.560 --> 12:04.630
So, yeah, she does.
She gets aggravated at me.

12:04.631 --> 12:07.854
I mean, I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to say.

12:07.855 --> 12:11.269
The only weird thing that
ever happened to me was..

12:11.270 --> 12:14.016
A buddy of mine, Danny.. And myself..

12:14.017 --> 12:16.660
Had come back by the house
on our way to Mobile.

12:16.661 --> 12:18.574
When I go in the house..

12:18.575 --> 12:22.209
I heard a little girl scream.

12:22.210 --> 12:23.725
Just like a kid screaming?

12:23.726 --> 12:28.286
No, it was like I had startled the child.

12:29.114 --> 12:33.677
And the little girl screamed two more
times before I got back to my truck.

12:33.678 --> 12:36.456
There's no small children in this area,

12:36.457 --> 12:38.317
and it sounded like it
come from in the house.

12:38.318 --> 12:40.552
But I don't know where it come from.

12:40.553 --> 12:42.740
And when I got in the
truck, Danny asked me.

12:42.741 --> 12:46.090
He said, "tell me you heard that."

12:46.091 --> 12:47.991
I said, "heard what, Danny?"

12:47.992 --> 12:52.972
He said.. "Well, I heard
a little girl scream."

12:54.885 --> 12:58.145
I am hearing residual screaming.
I don't know what that's about.

12:58.146 --> 13:00.172
Female..

13:00.173 --> 13:01.022
Screaming.

13:01.023 --> 13:02.291
Words or just screams?

13:02.292 --> 13:04.236
Nah, just screaming.

13:04.237 --> 13:07.777
High-pitched screaming, pain.

13:10.252 --> 13:12.030
And they're frightened..

13:12.031 --> 13:15.140
And I feel like they're being harmed.

13:15.141 --> 13:16.690
And..

13:16.691 --> 13:18.944
They're afraid of something.

13:18.945 --> 13:21.812
Can other people hear these screams?

13:21.813 --> 13:26.253
If they're a little bit sensitive, yeah.

13:29.248 --> 13:32.689
Ty told me that the one time he experienced
something strange at the house,

13:32.690 --> 13:34.885
he was with a good friend of his.

13:34.886 --> 13:37.100
I'm on my way to meet with
this guy at a local diner,

13:37.101 --> 13:41.661
to see what his take is on those screams.

13:49.926 --> 13:52.856
Danny, thanks for meeting with me.
I appreciate it.

13:52.857 --> 13:54.176
I just spoke with Ty.

13:54.177 --> 13:56.064
Um, he told me about an incident

13:56.065 --> 13:59.709
that you were present for,
uh, regarding a girl.

13:59.710 --> 14:01.999
Steve, we come in from
hunting one afternoon.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.210
It was after dark.

14:03.211 --> 14:07.096
Ty had come back to get his keys
to go in to lock the house up,

14:07.097 --> 14:11.714
and, uh, he headed up the
steps, and I heard this..

14:11.715 --> 14:14.124
God-awful, hair-curling scream.

14:14.125 --> 14:16.779
A little girl screamed three times.

14:16.780 --> 14:20.264
Just as loud as you ever
heard in your life.

14:20.265 --> 14:22.295
You hear a scream like that,
you gotta be concerned.

14:22.296 --> 14:24.219
I got out of the vehicle.
I looked around, looked around.

14:24.220 --> 14:27.733
There was nobody nowhere to be found.

14:27.734 --> 14:30.494
It's not normal.

14:31.247 --> 14:32.883
You weren't a believer in the paranormal?

14:32.884 --> 14:34.479
No, Sir.

14:34.480 --> 14:36.683
Did that change your mind?

14:36.684 --> 14:39.628
It definitely changed my mind.

14:39.629 --> 14:42.178
And you definitely think there's
something going on in that house?

14:42.179 --> 14:45.239
Oh, I have no doubt.

14:45.573 --> 14:48.288
Now Robin told me about
falling from the ceiling.

14:48.289 --> 14:51.793
She didn't fall. She got pushed.

14:51.794 --> 14:56.234
I tell you, that little girl pushed her.

14:57.424 --> 15:00.044
You know, I fear for Robin because..
I'm gonna be honest..

15:00.045 --> 15:02.007
I think the little girl's picking on her.

15:02.008 --> 15:03.990
Danny, would you live there?

15:03.991 --> 15:05.780
Ain't no way, Steve.

15:05.781 --> 15:07.229
Ain't no way.

15:07.230 --> 15:08.970
I don't believe Robin's still living there.

15:08.971 --> 15:14.871
If Robin was my wife and she experienced
what she had, we'd have to leave.

15:14.904 --> 15:19.044
Let the little girl have that place.

15:24.758 --> 15:26.227
There's a lot going on here.

15:26.228 --> 15:29.010
There really.. Is a lot.

15:29.011 --> 15:30.366
It's really physical (Bleep).

15:30.367 --> 15:33.787
And, like, I feel nervous.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.808
I don't like it.

15:39.809 --> 15:42.958
There's a little girl.
She's just a sick (Bleep).

15:42.959 --> 15:47.764
She doesn't want people to know
the bad things that she does.

15:47.765 --> 15:51.605
She kinda wants to kill someone.

16:05.117 --> 16:08.597
There's a lot of movement.

16:11.690 --> 16:14.203
He's all over here. He can move things.

16:14.204 --> 16:17.933
He's like a poltergeist manifestation.

16:17.934 --> 16:19.998
Every time I encounter a dead person,

16:19.999 --> 16:23.863
this entity comes storming
in, trying to distract me.

16:23.864 --> 16:29.084
He feels like a poltergeist,
but I can't be sure.

16:30.298 --> 16:31.156
Are you all right?

16:31.157 --> 16:34.877
No. I don't really wanna be..

16:38.728 --> 16:41.086
This dark entity wants me out of the house.

16:41.087 --> 16:45.063
And when it isn't flashing
horrifying images in my mind..

16:45.064 --> 16:47.859
It's trying to suffocate me.

16:47.860 --> 16:52.540
Wherever this guy is, it's hard to breathe.

16:52.620 --> 16:56.635
He makes it hard to breathe,
but it's, like, from inside.

16:56.636 --> 17:00.836
It's really weird. I don't like it.

17:01.328 --> 17:04.568
Tries to, like, smother.

17:05.695 --> 17:08.935
He's trying to smother.

17:13.675 --> 17:15.724
I've gathered a lot of witness testimony,

17:15.726 --> 17:19.925
but right now, I'm a little short on facts,

17:19.925 --> 17:25.826
so I'm headed over to the County Deeds
Office to see if I can turn something up.

17:26.693 --> 17:28.038
According to the town records,

17:28.039 --> 17:31.870
a family by the name of Garrett
originally owned the property.

17:31.871 --> 17:35.891
But that's about all I'm finding.

17:40.371 --> 17:42.893
Records go back all the way to the 1880s.

17:42.894 --> 17:44.583
But for some strange reason,

17:44.584 --> 17:49.984
I'm not turning up anything
specific about the house.

17:52.757 --> 17:56.928
I tracked down the woman who
sold the place to Robin and Ty.

17:56.929 --> 18:01.532
She lived in that house for over 30 years.

18:01.533 --> 18:04.756
I'm headed over to speak with her now and
see if she experienced anything weird

18:04.757 --> 18:08.177
when she was living there.

18:16.881 --> 18:19.270
Anna, thanks for meeting with me.
I appreciate that.

18:19.271 --> 18:22.587
The house I'm investigating in town, I
did some research, your name popped up.

18:22.588 --> 18:24.017
Uh, you had lived there?

18:24.018 --> 18:26.584
Yes. I lived there with my husband, yes.

18:26.585 --> 18:28.385
Mm.

18:31.229 --> 18:34.709
Now he passed away in '97.

18:35.720 --> 18:36.622
I'm sorry to hear that.

18:36.623 --> 18:38.233
Did he.. What did he die
of, if you don't mind?

18:38.234 --> 18:39.734
He had a massive heart attack.

18:39.735 --> 18:41.535
Oh.

18:42.068 --> 18:43.192
Did he die in the house?

18:43.193 --> 18:47.074
No. He was out looking
at some of his property.

18:47.075 --> 18:49.846
It's gonna sound funny, but
I gotta ask you a question.

18:49.847 --> 18:53.451
Did you ever experience any
paranormal things in the house?

18:53.452 --> 18:54.431
No.

18:54.432 --> 18:56.021
Mm, nothing you couldn't explain?

18:56.022 --> 18:57.250
- No.
- Nor did your husband?

18:57.251 --> 18:58.757
No.

18:58.758 --> 19:00.625
Anna, maybe you could clear
something up for me.

19:00.626 --> 19:05.160
Um, the house records and the
property records aren't matching up.

19:05.161 --> 19:06.631
Uh, does that make any sense to you?

19:06.632 --> 19:08.757
Yeah, the house was not there originally.

19:08.758 --> 19:12.421
My husband moved the
house there in the '60s.

19:12.422 --> 19:14.258
What do you.. What do you mean by that?

19:14.259 --> 19:16.020
My husband found it..

19:16.021 --> 19:20.088
In.. Over in Clark County and
bought it and moved it there.

19:20.089 --> 19:21.515
How far away was the house?

19:21.516 --> 19:23.550
About 90 miles.

19:23.551 --> 19:24.880
So how did he move it?

19:24.881 --> 19:27.286
He moved it on tractor trailers.

19:27.287 --> 19:28.820
You mean they took the house apart?

19:28.821 --> 19:29.876
Yeah, board by board.

19:29.877 --> 19:31.939
Tore it down board by board.

19:31.940 --> 19:33.147
Now where did the house sit?

19:33.148 --> 19:34.826
Was it in anything place in particular?

19:34.827 --> 19:37.017
- It was in Packers Bend..
- Okay.

19:37.018 --> 19:39.224
Which was in the bend of the Alabama river.

19:39.225 --> 19:44.745
You could see the river from
three sides of the house.

19:49.272 --> 19:55.172
There was another structure, and it
was moving, moving, moving. Mm-hmm.

20:02.721 --> 20:06.921
There's, like, people out here, but..

20:10.464 --> 20:15.629
They're, like, wandering around
without knowing where they're going.

20:15.630 --> 20:18.150
And there's..

20:18.870 --> 20:20.372
A river..

20:20.373 --> 20:23.253
Which is important?

20:24.319 --> 20:28.038
I'm feeling some association
with this house and a river.

20:28.039 --> 20:32.959
But I can't quite tell
how they're connected.

20:34.820 --> 20:37.449
What about the family that originally
owned the house back in those days?

20:37.450 --> 20:39.327
Did you know anything about that?

20:39.328 --> 20:41.376
No, I just know it was the King family.

20:41.377 --> 20:43.095
The King family?

20:43.096 --> 20:45.047
Okay, so they're the ones
I assume built the house?

20:45.048 --> 20:47.162
Yes, mm-hmm.

20:47.163 --> 20:49.023
Huh.

20:53.233 --> 20:58.179
Now that I know the King family
originally built the house..

20:58.180 --> 21:01.374
I've tracked down one of their descendants.

21:01.375 --> 21:06.655
I'm hoping he can provide
me with more information.

21:14.949 --> 21:16.551
The house I'm investigating in town

21:16.552 --> 21:19.359
apparently belonged to your
family when it was here.

21:19.360 --> 21:20.099
Yes, Sir.

21:20.100 --> 21:22.125
And you're a descendant
of the original owners.

21:22.126 --> 21:23.776
- Yes, Sir.
- Uh, what can you tell me?

21:23.777 --> 21:26.187
The house was originally
built by a young couple..

21:26.188 --> 21:31.324
William "Dock" King who married,
uh, Rebecca Singleton Tait King.

21:31.325 --> 21:36.162
And they started building this big
house towards the beginning of 1860s.

21:36.163 --> 21:40.914
And it's about a half a mile from the
river, was the site of the house.

21:40.915 --> 21:44.903
For the time, they both were
from prominent families.

21:44.904 --> 21:48.253
And they both were used
to a certain way of life.

21:48.254 --> 21:52.240
And had grown up, um,
with slaves and servants.

21:52.241 --> 21:55.337
And were both well-educated.

21:55.338 --> 21:59.550
A very short period of time, they
pretty much lost everything.

21:59.551 --> 22:03.244
He went off to the civil war,
apparently caught Yellow Fever.

22:03.245 --> 22:08.345
And came back home to a..
A run-down plantation.

22:16.088 --> 22:19.735
I see all these men out there.

22:19.736 --> 22:23.176
They kinda look like soldiers.
They're wearing gray.

22:23.177 --> 22:24.882
So, like, civil war?

22:24.883 --> 22:26.341
Yes.

22:26.342 --> 22:28.202
Yes.

22:30.010 --> 22:33.617
Yeah, I'm, like, seriously
seeing bodies in caskets.

22:33.618 --> 22:37.638
They scare me. I don't like them.

22:52.115 --> 22:58.015
So the husband, Mr. King, he comes
back, he contracts Yellow Fever..

22:58.133 --> 23:02.726
And from what we understand, he..
He came home, he was very sick.

23:02.727 --> 23:05.922
During that time, they lost, uh,
two of their young children

23:05.923 --> 23:10.467
while they were constructing the house
during the early years of 1860s.

23:10.468 --> 23:13.570
And one day, a toddler daughter, Rebecca..

23:13.571 --> 23:16.552
Who was named for his wife.. Passed away.

23:16.553 --> 23:18.882
And then William passed away the next day.

23:18.883 --> 23:20.726
And then several years later,

23:20.727 --> 23:25.745
um, she loses a daughter,
Alabama King Farr, passed away.

23:25.746 --> 23:27.450
And she was 26.

23:27.451 --> 23:29.652
Do you know what they died of?
Yellow Fever.

23:29.653 --> 23:31.807
Do you think all the family
members died in the house?

23:31.808 --> 23:35.825
There were no hospitals at the time,
and typically, if someone was ill,

23:35.826 --> 23:37.951
the Doctors would come to the house.

23:37.952 --> 23:43.412
So I feel sure that these
children died at the house.

23:48.861 --> 23:53.421
I do see there's.. A lot of dead bodies.

23:54.226 --> 23:58.186
So we have, like, five dead kids.

23:58.325 --> 24:02.057
But I feel like, you know, they
all, like, sit around in a circle

24:02.058 --> 24:04.354
and, like, play and..

24:04.355 --> 24:07.390
You know, do normal kid things,

24:07.391 --> 24:11.461
but they look like.. They..
They look really creepy.

24:11.462 --> 24:15.362
Like, they're creepy little kids.

24:15.497 --> 24:18.679
Their hair is..
Like, clumps have fallen out.

24:18.680 --> 24:20.934
Like, you know, like they're
rotting or something,

24:20.935 --> 24:22.654
like they just started rotting.

24:22.655 --> 24:24.496
It's like, there's a lot going on here.

24:24.497 --> 24:27.797
There really.. Is a lot.

24:32.048 --> 24:34.868
I don't like it.

24:35.385 --> 24:37.905
Rebecca.. She pretty much lost everything.

24:37.906 --> 24:43.287
They just really lost their
fortune and family members.

24:43.288 --> 24:45.517
So how did Rebecca handle all this?

24:45.518 --> 24:49.316
Uh, I'm sure it was really hard for her
at that time, to take care of herself

24:49.317 --> 24:52.702
and to know that she's responsible for
these seven children and the plantation,

24:52.703 --> 24:54.632
to keep things going.

24:54.633 --> 25:00.153
It was pretty dark times for
the family at that point.

25:04.314 --> 25:08.574
There is a very depressed lady around.

25:11.321 --> 25:16.661
There is a depressed lady
who wants to kill herself.

25:18.383 --> 25:20.663
Her head..

25:22.335 --> 25:23.646
Noisy.

25:23.647 --> 25:25.567
Okay.

25:26.270 --> 25:29.239
And there's a problem.

25:29.240 --> 25:32.660
She felt very overwhelmed..

25:32.760 --> 25:35.044
Thinking.. "How do you do? What do you do?"

25:35.045 --> 25:38.192
"How do you do it? How do you do that?"

25:38.193 --> 25:42.693
"Which way to do it? How do you do it?"

25:42.823 --> 25:45.763
Cut her wrists or..

25:47.845 --> 25:49.595
Hang?

25:49.596 --> 25:51.456
Or..

25:52.964 --> 25:56.384
Put something on her face?

26:00.937 --> 26:04.674
Yellow Fever wiped out
nearly half the King family,

26:04.675 --> 26:07.944
but I know almost nothing
about the disease.

26:07.945 --> 26:13.845
So I'm meeting with an Infectious
Disease expert to learn more about it.

26:22.059 --> 26:24.733
Yellow Fever is a viral illness
that you usually contract

26:24.734 --> 26:27.497
by being bitten by an infected mosquito.

26:27.498 --> 26:32.507
And after being bitten, they would
develop a fever, headache, muscle aches.

26:32.508 --> 26:36.543
Ultimately, they'll begin to develop
jaundice because the liver is infected.

26:36.544 --> 26:39.349
Um, and that's where the term
"Yellow Fever" comes from.

26:39.350 --> 26:44.681
And then over the next few days, that
might progress to more serious illness.

26:44.682 --> 26:46.587
Then they would have bleeding
from their G.I. tracts,

26:46.588 --> 26:49.876
uh, bleeding from their gums, bleeding
from their nose, vomiting blood.

26:49.877 --> 26:52.305
In the span of, you know, one to two weeks.

26:52.306 --> 26:56.686
- Uh, just like that?
- Just like that.

26:57.294 --> 27:00.397
All the sickness, everything,
is in this room.

27:00.398 --> 27:03.881
So there's, like, intestines
and there's, like, blood..

27:03.882 --> 27:09.030
And it has something to do with,
like, the abdominal area.

27:09.031 --> 27:13.969
Like, that's the focus is,
like, the abdominal area.

27:13.970 --> 27:15.192
They look ghoulish.

27:15.193 --> 27:17.604
Like, they're, like, pale
and, like, they have, like,

27:17.605 --> 27:21.118
the dark circles around their eyes.

27:21.119 --> 27:24.299
They look like zombies.

27:24.327 --> 27:27.507
They're, like, rotting.

27:32.679 --> 27:36.879
Uh.. They're watching the bodies rot.

27:46.243 --> 27:49.987
I came across many
entities during my walk..

27:49.988 --> 27:52.126
But the dark figure I
encountered in the bedroom

27:52.127 --> 27:55.490
was far more dangerous than any other.

27:55.491 --> 27:58.588
I'm having him sketched where
he stood out the clearest

27:58.589 --> 28:02.592
because it feels significant
to me for some reason.

28:02.593 --> 28:06.319
And there's this dark shadow man..

28:06.320 --> 28:08.958
Who's staring down..

28:08.959 --> 28:12.379
From the foot of the bed.

28:21.631 --> 28:22.619
And how tall?

28:22.620 --> 28:26.400
He's probably, like, 6-foot-5.

28:30.357 --> 28:33.117
There's no ears.

28:34.569 --> 28:38.229
Yeah, like that. I like that.

28:42.655 --> 28:46.135
Amy, is this what you saw?

28:47.314 --> 28:49.174
Yes.

29:19.146 --> 29:21.766
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations..

29:21.767 --> 29:23.960
It's time to compare our findings.

29:23.961 --> 29:27.774
We're about to reveal what we've
uncovered to our clients and each other.

29:27.775 --> 29:30.124
Well, Ty, Robin, it's good
to see you two again.

29:30.125 --> 29:31.326
They own this home.

29:31.327 --> 29:35.225
Neither one of them believed in the
paranormal before they moved here.

29:35.226 --> 29:36.361
Ty's still up in the air.

29:36.362 --> 29:38.743
He's not really convinced himself.

29:38.744 --> 29:43.136
But Robin's gone through some terrifying
ordeals since she's been here.

29:43.137 --> 29:46.460
And to be honest with you, I think
it's a miracle you're still alive.

29:46.461 --> 29:47.397
It is.

29:47.398 --> 29:49.367
Um, but we'll get into that later.

29:49.368 --> 29:51.296
Question is, is it safe for her to be here?

29:51.297 --> 29:53.257
That's why they called us in.

29:53.258 --> 29:59.158
So with that being said, maybe you can
tell us a little bit about your walk.

30:01.595 --> 30:04.598
During my walk, one of
the things that I got

30:04.599 --> 30:07.675
was when I was looking
out across the lawn..

30:07.676 --> 30:10.327
And I saw a river..

30:10.328 --> 30:14.410
And water, and I was getting
that that was very important.

30:14.411 --> 30:19.410
And there were a lot of men
who were dressed in gray..

30:19.411 --> 30:23.302
And may have been, like,
soldiers of some type.

30:23.303 --> 30:26.967
I see all these men out there.

30:26.968 --> 30:28.920
They kinda look like soldiers.

30:28.921 --> 30:31.510
- So, like, civil war?
- Yes.

30:31.511 --> 30:33.710
Well, a little bit of
history about the house..

30:33.711 --> 30:35.924
And when I was doing research on it,

30:35.925 --> 30:38.935
uh, a lot of it wasn't
making any sense to me.

30:38.936 --> 30:42.800
The problem is, this house
was built back in the 1850s.

30:42.801 --> 30:45.792
It was built about..
Less than two hours from here.

30:45.793 --> 30:49.305
But where it was originally
was by the Alabama river.

30:49.306 --> 30:50.519
Uh-huh.

30:50.520 --> 30:54.467
During my walk, I sensed that this
house was connected to a river..

30:54.468 --> 30:56.478
But I couldn't figure out how.

30:56.479 --> 30:58.617
Now it all makes sense.

30:58.618 --> 31:02.910
And it was moved in the 1960s to here.

31:02.911 --> 31:05.031
And the family that owned
the house and built it

31:05.032 --> 31:08.247
was, uh, William King and Rebecca Tait.

31:08.248 --> 31:10.879
They had a large family
when they built this home.

31:10.880 --> 31:14.640
During the war, he eventually
went off and fought.

31:14.641 --> 31:18.318
He fought for the confederates,
and the confederates wore gray.

31:18.319 --> 31:20.144
Interesting.

31:20.145 --> 31:21.736
Amy, what else did you see?

31:21.737 --> 31:24.549
There were, like, people just laid out.

31:24.550 --> 31:27.371
And.. Their intestines were out.

31:27.372 --> 31:28.633
Yeah, it was really disturbing.

31:28.634 --> 31:32.557
It has something to do with,
like, the abdominal area.

31:32.558 --> 31:35.407
Like, that's the focus.

31:35.408 --> 31:38.495
They're, like, rotting.

31:38.496 --> 31:44.396
There was a Doctor there, and, um,
he was treating some of them.

31:44.618 --> 31:46.359
The guy, William King,
who built this house.

31:46.360 --> 31:50.447
And went off to war, contracted
Yellow Fever while he was there.

31:50.448 --> 31:54.579
When he eventually did come back,
his plantation was in ruins.

31:54.580 --> 31:55.354
Oh.

31:55.355 --> 32:01.255
So when he came back to the house,
he wound up dying from Yellow Fever.

32:01.261 --> 32:07.161
Some of the symptoms of Yellow Fever
are, uh, severe intestinal distress.

32:07.388 --> 32:08.818
Basically, you kinda look like..

32:08.819 --> 32:11.497
The walking dead. When you get this stuff.

32:11.498 --> 32:13.294
- Hmm.
- So it's just..

32:13.295 --> 32:15.541
That's interesting.

32:15.542 --> 32:16.682
Well, why do you think it was interesting,

32:16.683 --> 32:18.401
about the Yellow Fever?
And what I said about the wa..

32:18.402 --> 32:23.406
Yeah, the walking dead because I got the
children in the bathroom back here.

32:23.407 --> 32:27.469
And there's about five of 'em,
and they look like zombies.

32:27.470 --> 32:29.245
They're creepy little kids.

32:29.246 --> 32:32.791
Like, their hair is..
Like, clumps have fallen out.

32:32.792 --> 32:34.995
Like, you know, like they're
rotting or something,

32:34.996 --> 32:36.834
like they just started rotting.

32:36.835 --> 32:39.238
They were afraid of me, and I
was kind of afraid of them

32:39.239 --> 32:41.994
because just kind of how they looked.

32:41.995 --> 32:43.569
And they were kind of rotting.

32:43.570 --> 32:47.246
So apparently they saw
their bodies rotting.

32:47.247 --> 32:48.755
And they became attached.

32:48.756 --> 32:53.412
Like, they.. They wouldn't
leave their physical bodies.

32:53.413 --> 32:58.785
During the war, Rebecca and, uh, William,
they lost two children in 1863,

32:58.786 --> 33:03.003
and then his daughter who was 2
died the day before he died,

33:03.004 --> 33:04.493
all to Yellow Fever.

33:04.494 --> 33:08.979
They were actually buried
together on the property.

33:08.980 --> 33:11.461
Ty, why don't you tell Amy what happened?

33:11.462 --> 33:16.044
I got out of my truck,
went up on the stairs,

33:16.045 --> 33:18.463
and it was like I startled a young girl.

33:18.464 --> 33:20.924
She screamed.

33:21.523 --> 33:25.592
Then I went inside and up and
come back down the steps,

33:25.593 --> 33:27.341
and she screamed two more times.

33:27.342 --> 33:30.842
It was like I startled her.

33:30.843 --> 33:32.746
That makes sense.

33:32.747 --> 33:36.941
Uh, they're very nervous, uh, whether
the person's living or dead,

33:36.942 --> 33:39.906
and they just keep to themselves.

33:39.907 --> 33:41.919
Like all entities in this house,

33:41.920 --> 33:45.391
these dead children are in
a constant state of fear.

33:45.392 --> 33:51.292
I know what's causing it, but I'm not
ready to tell Ty and Robin just yet.

33:51.859 --> 33:53.550
So what else happened on the walk?

33:53.551 --> 33:57.031
I met this lady, and she..

33:57.926 --> 34:01.046
Is extremely depressed.

34:01.214 --> 34:04.036
Everything that was going
on in her mind was, uh,

34:04.037 --> 34:08.815
about her suicide and
how she as gonna do it.

34:08.817 --> 34:12.596
I've never felt a depression
like that ever, ever.

34:12.597 --> 34:16.917
It was just, like, completely consuming.

34:17.610 --> 34:19.965
Talk about depression.. Rebecca King.

34:19.966 --> 34:23.918
Now I talked about how she..
She lost three kids..

34:23.920 --> 34:25.693
Then she lost her husband.

34:25.694 --> 34:30.942
It was right after the civil war, the
plantation they were on was in ruins.

34:30.943 --> 34:33.523
She was broke.

34:34.920 --> 34:37.462
I actually have a photo of her.

34:37.463 --> 34:43.362
This is the house when it was back there.
This is her here.

34:45.036 --> 34:47.556
That's crazy.

34:50.001 --> 34:55.900
The woman that I saw could possibly
be her but much, much younger.

34:56.703 --> 35:02.603
The other thing that I saw on my
walk was the most disturbing.

35:03.263 --> 35:07.108
I can tell you that it
is extremely negative.

35:07.109 --> 35:08.532
It is dangerous.

35:08.533 --> 35:12.493
It can interact with this reality.

35:12.701 --> 35:14.810
It feeds off of death.

35:14.811 --> 35:19.306
And it scared me and it put really
negative images during my whole walk.

35:19.307 --> 35:23.659
Of, like, throwing someone
down the stairs..

35:23.660 --> 35:25.486
Strangling someone.

35:25.487 --> 35:30.587
Like, it just wants..
It just feeds off of that.

35:30.978 --> 35:34.507
I had a really, really
frightening experience,

35:34.508 --> 35:39.908
which was the reason I started
trying to seek out help.

35:39.909 --> 35:44.403
Little over a year ago, I had to
go up in the attic for something.

35:44.404 --> 35:46.246
My brother-in-law was up there,

35:46.247 --> 35:51.285
and I walked across a..
A board that he had just walked across,

35:51.286 --> 35:54.286
and it broke on me.

35:55.787 --> 35:59.567
I fell from up in the center..

36:00.307 --> 36:02.770
Down to the floor in the entryway.

36:02.771 --> 36:05.231
Oh, my gosh.

36:07.275 --> 36:09.195
Whoa.

36:10.718 --> 36:14.050
I really shouldn't be here.

36:14.051 --> 36:17.951
It really should have killed me..

36:34.620 --> 36:38.400
I fell from up in the center..

36:39.218 --> 36:43.238
Down to the floor in the entryway.

36:44.509 --> 36:46.429
Whoa.

36:48.387 --> 36:51.818
I really shouldn't be here.

36:51.819 --> 36:55.659
It really should have killed me.

36:56.384 --> 37:00.164
I think I might need a moment.

37:02.229 --> 37:04.692
You know, your friend Danny
actually thinks she was pushed.

37:04.693 --> 37:06.900
Yeah, you know, that was the
first thing Danny told me.

37:06.901 --> 37:08.514
When I told him what happened to Robin.

37:08.515 --> 37:12.835
He said, "that little girl pushed her."

37:13.468 --> 37:19.242
I agree that Robin was pushed, but I
don't think it was by the little girl.

37:19.243 --> 37:22.818
I actually did a sketch of this entity.

37:22.819 --> 37:26.213
- You did a sketch?
- Well, kind of like a situation..

37:26.214 --> 37:29.621
- Hmm.
- That I saw on my walk.

37:29.622 --> 37:31.842
Okay. Mm.

37:34.662 --> 37:36.582
Yeah.

37:38.938 --> 37:44.038
Well, I've never seen a
sketch like this before.

37:44.720 --> 37:46.760
Creepy.

37:47.326 --> 37:49.452
That gives me chills.

37:49.453 --> 37:53.653
It really scares the hell out of me.

38:05.122 --> 38:10.042
It, uh, was beside my bed
one night, actually.

38:12.971 --> 38:16.500
It changed shape and kind
of went into my chest.

38:16.501 --> 38:19.045
And when it did..

38:19.046 --> 38:21.701
I was freezing, freezing cold.

38:21.702 --> 38:25.052
And I felt like I was being
electrically shocked.

38:25.053 --> 38:25.990
- At the same time.
- Mm-hmm.

38:25.991 --> 38:27.781
I was just like..

38:27.782 --> 38:30.930
"W.. What does it want? Why is it here?"

38:30.931 --> 38:35.491
When her husband died,
I think that she..

38:35.918 --> 38:38.663
Couldn't handle losing her
husband and her children.

38:38.664 --> 38:44.021
She inadvertently trapped the
children and her husband.

38:44.022 --> 38:46.341
So she goes into this major depression,

38:46.342 --> 38:50.265
and she may have had this ability..
Psychokinesis.

38:50.266 --> 38:52.912
Individuals who have the
ability of psychokinesis.

38:52.913 --> 38:56.023
Could create a psychokinetic manifestation.

38:56.024 --> 38:57.399
These entities feed off.

38:57.400 --> 38:59.611
The negative emotions of the living.

38:59.612 --> 39:00.763
They're very powerful.

39:00.764 --> 39:04.544
And can physically influence
their environment.

39:04.545 --> 39:08.617
Now what someone can do when
they have this type of ability.

39:08.618 --> 39:11.094
Is when they..

39:11.095 --> 39:14.900
Go into a depression or
if they're very angry..

39:14.901 --> 39:19.370
They can then take energy
from their environment.

39:19.371 --> 39:22.241
And they can create an entity.

39:22.242 --> 39:25.653
This entity will consist
of not only, you know,

39:25.654 --> 39:28.004
the dead people that's in that area.

39:28.005 --> 39:31.044
But it also consists of the person's..

39:31.045 --> 39:32.637
Stress..

39:32.638 --> 39:33.800
Depression..

39:33.801 --> 39:35.612
Anxiety.

39:35.613 --> 39:40.253
This thing needs to feed
itself, like an animal..

39:40.254 --> 39:43.379
And its food is weakness..

39:43.380 --> 39:45.089
Despair, anger..

39:45.090 --> 39:47.070
Death.

39:47.239 --> 39:49.600
You guys have heard the term "poltergeist"?

39:49.601 --> 39:51.619
That's a step below this.

39:51.620 --> 39:52.928
This is severe.

39:52.929 --> 39:54.378
P.K. Manifestation..

39:54.379 --> 39:58.629
You've created an entity to
basically do your bidding.

39:58.630 --> 40:03.310
It's not like she knew she was doing this.

40:03.930 --> 40:07.525
- So it's unintentional?
- Yes.

40:07.526 --> 40:10.097
So I know this was a lot for
you two to absorb tonight.

40:10.098 --> 40:13.770
Question is, though, how do you get rid
of this thing, and if you're safe?

40:13.771 --> 40:19.171
Um, the only one that can
really answer that is Amy.

40:19.734 --> 40:22.654
Considering what it has..

40:22.655 --> 40:25.175
Already done..

40:25.489 --> 40:30.649
I don't really think it's
safe for you to stay.

40:35.153 --> 40:38.908
I don't wanna be evicted by a thing..

40:38.909 --> 40:41.538
- Right.
- From everything I've worked for.

40:41.539 --> 40:44.180
I've put a lot of blood,
sweat, and tears in it.

40:44.181 --> 40:48.141
If you're determined to stay,
what I would suggest is having

40:48.142 --> 40:51.340
a medium come in and first
deal with the children.

40:51.341 --> 40:52.852
And moving them on.

40:52.853 --> 40:55.047
The medium would have to be.

40:55.048 --> 40:58.917
Someone who has some
type therapy background

40:58.918 --> 41:01.683
because, I mean, there's a lot
of dynamics going on here.

41:01.684 --> 41:04.295
That they're gonna have to
have long communication about.

41:04.296 --> 41:07.748
And I can help you find
a legitimate medium.

41:07.749 --> 41:12.374
And that way, the psychokinesis
will begin to diminish,

41:12.375 --> 41:16.016
but it can still harm in the meantime.

41:16.017 --> 41:19.116
There's cleansing techniques
to protect yourself

41:19.117 --> 41:23.615
by bringing in someone who
is religious, like a priest,

41:23.616 --> 41:29.516
because his belief in his religion
could potentially affect this thing.

41:29.568 --> 41:32.568
And make it.. Leave.

41:38.958 --> 41:41.589
So are the two of yous
gonna take Amy's advice.

41:41.590 --> 41:44.162
And get a medium and try
to take care of this?

41:44.163 --> 41:47.283
- I think so.
- Okay.

41:47.304 --> 41:48.292
Absolutely.

41:48.293 --> 41:49.475
This is my time here.

41:49.476 --> 41:52.763
I'll be, you know, one of them before long.

41:52.764 --> 41:55.649
This is mine for now.

41:55.650 --> 41:57.189
Well, we know what it is.
I wanna get rid of it.

41:57.190 --> 42:00.010
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

42:02.423 --> 42:07.134
As long as they are in this house, Robin
and Ty could be in serious danger.

42:07.135 --> 42:10.783
I really hope they follow through
with their promise to cleanse it.

42:10.784 --> 42:16.684
Otherwise, Robin may not be as lucky
the next time the entity attacks.
