WEBVTT

01:25.700 --> 01:28.069
Listen to that.

01:28.102 --> 01:31.573
Now this is
real music.

01:31.606 --> 01:33.075
Lame.

01:33.108 --> 01:35.844
Dad stop.

01:39.013 --> 01:43.451
Much better.

01:52.760 --> 01:56.030
<i>So honey bun or bear claw?</i>

01:56.063 --> 01:57.899
<i>Aren't they
basically the same thing?</i>

01:57.933 --> 02:00.736
- <i>Not at all.</i>
- <i>Surprise me then!</i>

02:00.769 --> 02:02.471
<i>You got it!</i>

02:02.504 --> 02:04.606
<i>Harvey's here we come.</i>

02:41.943 --> 02:43.179
Dad.

02:45.013 --> 02:47.849
<i>Dad?</i>

02:47.883 --> 02:49.919
<i>Hello, dad?</i>

02:49.951 --> 02:52.754
You're doing that
stare thing again.

02:52.788 --> 02:55.191
You are your mother's
daughter; you know that.

02:55.223 --> 02:57.525
You're scanning
while we're waiting.

02:57.558 --> 02:59.861
And you're laying that
accent on pretty thick.

02:59.895 --> 03:02.465
You'll catch it too when
you've been here longer.

03:02.497 --> 03:05.667
I mean, do you think you're
ever gonna unpack?

03:05.700 --> 03:08.102
It's only been
seven months.

03:08.135 --> 03:09.103
That's not too
long at my age.

03:09.137 --> 03:10.939
I reckon.

03:15.510 --> 03:18.213
All right, I'll be
right back.

03:24.719 --> 03:27.021
- <i>ยกHola!</i>
- Howdy.

03:27.055 --> 03:29.492
You been busy?

03:29.525 --> 03:32.661
S... Sorta.

03:39.735 --> 03:42.004
Honey bun or bear claw.

03:42.037 --> 03:43.572
Huh?

03:43.604 --> 03:44.706
Honey bun or bear claw?

03:44.740 --> 03:46.808
Big decision
of the day.

03:46.842 --> 03:50.546
Aren't they sort
of the same?

03:50.579 --> 03:51.947
That's like saying
North Carolina and Texas

03:51.979 --> 03:53.248
barbecue are the same.

03:53.282 --> 03:55.718
Sorry.

03:55.751 --> 03:59.254
Honey bun's got
less cinnamon.

03:59.288 --> 04:01.524
Harvey said he was hiring.

04:11.199 --> 04:13.135
I just recently moved
here myself.

04:13.168 --> 04:16.105
Career change.

04:16.137 --> 04:18.107
Are you from
around here?

04:18.139 --> 04:19.908
Just passing through.

04:22.009 --> 04:23.512
Hiking the Appalachian Trail.

04:26.348 --> 04:28.083
Trying to grab some
cash before I head north.

04:28.115 --> 04:29.985
The Appalachian, ha.

04:32.220 --> 04:35.157
I hiked the Golden Crest
of California...

04:35.189 --> 04:37.059
which is the equivalent.

04:37.091 --> 04:39.995
Cool.

04:40.028 --> 04:42.131
Maine to Georgia.

04:42.163 --> 04:45.800
That's a commitment.

04:45.834 --> 04:47.903
Takes a lot
of discipline.

04:47.935 --> 04:48.870
Yes sir.

04:51.273 --> 04:52.775
You don't look
like a hiker.

04:57.112 --> 04:59.281
That's the beautiful thing
about hiking, isn't it?

04:59.314 --> 05:02.051
Anybody can do it.

05:02.084 --> 05:05.153
Yeah...

05:19.834 --> 05:20.969
I'll be right back.

05:23.004 --> 05:25.074
Where is he?

05:25.107 --> 05:27.276
Where is Harvey?

05:32.648 --> 05:33.849
<i>Help!</i>

05:33.882 --> 05:35.985
Help!

05:37.685 --> 05:38.987
<i>Shut him up!</i>

05:41.857 --> 05:44.159
<i>Hey man...
Do you hear anything?</i>

05:44.192 --> 05:46.328
<i>Shh.</i>

06:04.879 --> 06:06.382
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

06:19.827 --> 06:20.895
Good job!

06:24.165 --> 06:25.367
You all right, Harvey?

06:25.399 --> 06:27.402
Yeah.

06:27.435 --> 06:29.237
Good work;
thanks Justin.

06:35.177 --> 06:37.079
Man, I tell ya...

06:37.112 --> 06:39.748
two tours of duty,
four special ops,

06:39.781 --> 06:43.786
three stick-ups
here in 40 years.

06:43.819 --> 06:45.788
And nobody's ever surprised
me that bad, Justin.

06:47.389 --> 06:49.290
You were
outnumbered.

06:49.324 --> 06:51.126
<i>Well so were you.</i>

06:51.158 --> 06:53.461
<i>I'm just not the man
I used to be, man.</i>

06:53.495 --> 06:55.730
Well, none
of us are.

06:59.867 --> 07:01.437
<i>Harvey, I'm
gonna bring Maddie in.</i>

07:01.470 --> 07:03.172
<i>Wait for the cavalry to arrive.</i>

07:03.204 --> 07:07.041
Okay, thanks
again buddy.

07:13.514 --> 07:15.685
Oh, man.

07:18.286 --> 07:19.321
Better check
your phone.

07:19.353 --> 07:20.923
Mom's probably
calling.

07:20.956 --> 07:22.925
<i>My phone's broke.</i>

07:22.958 --> 07:24.927
<i>Goodness gracious, Sheriff!</i>

07:24.959 --> 07:26.461
<i>Roadhouse called, they're
wanting their mules back.</i>

07:26.495 --> 07:28.864
Did you run
the tags?

07:28.896 --> 07:30.932
You put a whoopin'
on these boys Sheriff.

07:30.966 --> 07:32.800
There ain't nothing to
brigadee about 'em now.

07:32.834 --> 07:34.802
Did you run
the tags?

07:34.836 --> 07:36.939
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.

07:36.971 --> 07:39.108
The car's
stolen, Sheriff.

07:39.141 --> 07:41.176
- Outsiders?
- Yes sir.

07:41.209 --> 07:42.944
Yeah, Philly got
a warrant out for 'em.

07:42.978 --> 07:44.480
Murder.

07:48.115 --> 07:50.885
How did you know
something was amiss?

07:50.918 --> 07:54.188
Every millennial I've ever known
is always on their phone.

07:54.221 --> 07:57.492
- Obsessed with the stupid thing.
- Hmm.

07:57.526 --> 08:00.228
He was just standing
there... alert.

08:00.262 --> 08:01.062
<i>You learn that in the army?</i>

08:01.096 --> 08:02.764
<i>Dad?</i>

08:02.798 --> 08:03.865
Mom's gotta be
worried sick; let's go!

08:03.899 --> 08:05.134
All right,
you're in charge.

08:05.166 --> 08:07.135
Oh, yes sir.

08:11.072 --> 08:12.040
You know, if I had a phone
I could've called mom.

08:22.983 --> 08:26.121
Justin...

09:10.298 --> 09:13.168
Oh! Now that's what I call
good country music.

09:13.201 --> 09:15.403
Thank you, ladies
and gentlemen.

09:15.437 --> 09:17.438
Me and the boys are gonna take
a little bit of a breather now.

09:17.471 --> 09:20.875
Give the mayor a chance
to get up here and say howdy.

09:20.908 --> 09:22.443
I want you all to give
it up for Mayor Brady.

09:26.081 --> 09:28.550
Yeah!

09:28.582 --> 09:31.052
How about that
band, y'all?

09:34.956 --> 09:36.490
<i>I would like to hand
the mic over to our</i>

09:36.524 --> 09:41.028
gold-level sponsor and our
town's newest developer...

09:41.062 --> 09:44.966
Your very own Vivian
McGrath-Keagan.

09:54.241 --> 09:58.079
Hello, friends
and neighbors.

09:58.113 --> 10:02.084
<i>Like most of you I grew
up here in Blue Ridge.</i>

10:02.116 --> 10:06.087
My roots, like
yours, run deep.

10:06.120 --> 10:10.925
I've seen the world and that
means I've seen the differences.

10:10.958 --> 10:14.128
Our history speaks for itself.

10:14.162 --> 10:18.233
Believe me when I say this is
one of the few places left in

10:18.265 --> 10:21.903
in our country where we can say
it's safe to raise a family.

10:21.937 --> 10:23.906
<i>We give neighborhood watch...</i>

10:23.938 --> 10:26.341
its truest meaning.

10:26.374 --> 10:28.976
Friends stands by friend,

10:29.009 --> 10:33.514
family protects family.

10:33.548 --> 10:36.918
<i>Blue Ridge is our home.</i>

10:39.653 --> 10:40.522
<i>Hey, it's Justin, leave it.</i>

10:44.558 --> 10:45.293
Well, this definitely
ain't getting mom back.

10:48.629 --> 10:50.231
Sorry, we're late.

10:50.264 --> 10:51.299
Could've called.

10:51.332 --> 10:53.534
Phone broke.

10:53.567 --> 10:55.269
He beat up some
bad guys at Harvey's.

10:55.302 --> 10:57.038
Does trouble just find you
or do you seek it out?

10:57.072 --> 10:59.006
<i>Both!</i>

10:59.039 --> 11:00.375
But of course...
this could've all been resolved

11:00.408 --> 11:02.144
- if I had my own phone.
- No!

11:06.047 --> 11:07.014
Where were you while your
daddy was beating up bad guys?

11:07.048 --> 11:08.017
She was safe
in the car.

11:09.384 --> 11:11.385
Safe?

11:11.418 --> 11:13.020
Safe like when you
chased that pick-pocket

11:13.053 --> 11:15.189
with her in a stroller?

11:15.222 --> 11:17.024
People run with
strollers all the time.

11:17.057 --> 11:19.027
Run, yes...
chase, no.

11:19.059 --> 11:20.594
My job was to
protect and serve.

11:20.628 --> 11:22.597
You can't put that
on a calendar.

11:22.629 --> 11:24.466
That's the story
of my life.

11:24.499 --> 11:25.500
Come on!

11:27.601 --> 11:29.303
- Hi.
- Hey.

11:29.336 --> 11:30.438
I missed you.

11:30.471 --> 11:33.307
You comin'?

11:33.341 --> 11:35.443
Come on, you can shake a few
hands, kiss a few babies.

11:35.476 --> 11:39.548
Sheriffs don't
kiss babies.

11:39.581 --> 11:43.085
You could do the dunk tank and I
could throw some apples at you.

11:43.118 --> 11:44.386
Can you blame me?

11:46.653 --> 11:48.456
Sorry we were late.

11:48.490 --> 11:50.524
Again.

11:50.557 --> 11:52.059
You're not
helpin' any.

11:52.092 --> 11:53.361
<i>Sir?</i>

11:53.394 --> 11:54.596
- Sir...
- <i>Hey, Becky.</i>

11:54.629 --> 11:55.529
- What's up?
- Elli, wait.

11:55.562 --> 11:58.600
Don't go in.

11:58.633 --> 12:00.302
We've got a
problem, sheriff.

12:00.335 --> 12:02.471
- What?
- You know Vivian, the developer?

12:02.504 --> 12:04.639
Yeah...

12:04.672 --> 12:06.074
She's been murdered.

12:14.149 --> 12:17.251
She's back there.

12:17.284 --> 12:20.488
- Who found her?
- Mrs. Pierce.

12:20.522 --> 12:22.491
She went looking for Vivian
when she heard their yells.

12:22.524 --> 12:24.158
She found her all right.

12:24.192 --> 12:25.760
She's in shock.

12:25.793 --> 12:28.230
What did she want
from the deceased?

12:28.263 --> 12:28.864
<i>She's working
some land next to Vivian's</i>

12:28.897 --> 12:31.066
<i>house with her husband Jim.</i>

12:31.099 --> 12:31.767
<i>After this,
get a statement.</i>

12:31.799 --> 12:34.101
<i>Sheriff!</i>

12:34.134 --> 12:36.771
- Mayor...
- This is terrible.

12:36.804 --> 12:39.774
<i>Just horrible... and on
the biggest day of the year.</i>

12:39.807 --> 12:41.109
What's our plan?

12:41.142 --> 12:43.177
<i>Our</i> plan?

12:43.211 --> 12:46.281
This sort of thing's never
happened around here, Sheriff.

12:46.313 --> 12:47.716
Take one step
at a time.

12:47.749 --> 12:49.183
That's how you
solve these cases.

12:49.216 --> 12:51.218
Let me tell
you something.

12:51.251 --> 12:52.787
We're a tight-knit community
with a resistance against

12:52.821 --> 12:55.157
change and outsiders.

12:55.190 --> 12:56.691
And you're both.

12:56.724 --> 12:58.527
Which is why we
brought you in.

12:58.559 --> 13:00.261
To clean things up a bit.

13:00.294 --> 13:02.697
<i>To bring a fresh perspective.</i>

13:02.730 --> 13:04.499
<i>Or maybe do some good that
only an outsider could do.</i>

13:04.532 --> 13:06.602
<i>Clean this up, okay?</i>

13:07.769 --> 13:10.138
We'll do our job.

13:10.171 --> 13:11.139
Whether they want to or not,
the community is depending

13:11.172 --> 13:12.641
on you Sheriff.

13:12.673 --> 13:13.608
Make sure you do
your job right.

13:16.110 --> 13:18.547
What a day.

13:18.580 --> 13:21.383
Out of the frying pan into
the fire, huh Sheriff?

13:21.416 --> 13:23.819
- Did you clean Harvey up?
- Yes sir.

13:23.851 --> 13:26.620
Three bandits are
behind bars.

13:26.653 --> 13:29.157
Pennsylvania staties
are on their way.

13:38.399 --> 13:41.702
Probable cause
of death?

13:41.735 --> 13:43.672
Capillary damage was in the
surrounding interstitial tissues

13:43.705 --> 13:45.740
on her lower extremities.

13:45.773 --> 13:48.210
English Becky for
the love of Pete.

13:48.243 --> 13:50.512
Scratches
and bruises...

13:50.544 --> 13:53.615
broken ankle...

13:53.648 --> 13:55.484
probably from
a struggle.

13:55.517 --> 13:56.685
I'm guessing, cause of death
is blunt force trauma

13:56.717 --> 13:58.719
to the back of the head.

13:58.753 --> 14:02.591
There's dirt impacted
in the wound.

14:02.624 --> 14:05.460
<i>Take a look at that gash.</i>

14:05.493 --> 14:08.597
<i>Probably from a rock,
don't you think?</i>

14:08.629 --> 14:09.764
Yeah, I <i>think.</i>

14:12.232 --> 14:13.668
We're having the
area searched.

14:16.437 --> 14:19.240
Anyone search these
porta potties, hmm?

14:19.274 --> 14:21.442
Oh...

14:21.475 --> 14:24.145
My theory Sheriff is...

14:24.178 --> 14:26.447
if I was a killer
I wouldn't wanna hide

14:26.480 --> 14:30.152
no evidence in a toilet.

14:30.184 --> 14:32.887
Report what you find.

14:32.921 --> 14:34.123
- Okay c'mon...
- All right.

14:36.691 --> 14:38.225
Ha!

14:38.259 --> 14:40.562
Oh, uh... fine, uh!

14:40.595 --> 14:43.532
I'll go find
some proper attire.

14:43.565 --> 14:45.200
On it, Sheriff.

14:45.232 --> 14:47.368
Persons of interest?

14:47.402 --> 14:51.473
At this point,
the whole town.

14:51.505 --> 14:53.774
When was the last
time <i>you</i> saw her?

14:53.807 --> 14:55.710
- During her speech.
- <i>And anyone...</i>

14:55.743 --> 14:58.280
<i>can now own a piece of
this mountain paradise...</i>

14:58.312 --> 15:01.216
starting in just the 700s.

15:07.522 --> 15:09.891
Please, I know it
seems drastic-

15:09.923 --> 15:11.592
<i>You won't
get away with this!</i>

15:11.625 --> 15:13.327
If you have any questions
I'd love to-

15:14.596 --> 15:16.431
Here we go.

15:18.832 --> 15:21.502
Vivian's part of
the McGrath family.

15:21.535 --> 15:23.504
Old man Cliff's daughter.

15:23.538 --> 15:26.274
She was his pride and joy.

15:26.307 --> 15:29.878
- Was?
- Until she married big-city Lem Keagan.

15:29.910 --> 15:32.379
He took her off to D.C.
where she made some real

15:32.413 --> 15:34.682
money and came back "different,"
as us locals say.

15:34.716 --> 15:37.818
What happened next?

15:37.851 --> 15:39.788
Well...

15:39.821 --> 15:41.523
things escalated pretty
quickly after that.

15:48.528 --> 15:51.232
Thompson, don't puke on the crime scene.

15:51.265 --> 15:53.367
Ah, hey Sheriff-

15:53.400 --> 15:55.703
Hey Sheriff?

15:55.736 --> 15:57.871
Are them my
fishing waders?

15:57.904 --> 16:00.408
Well, they were
in your truck.

16:00.441 --> 16:01.643
Well, that would
make them mine.

16:06.480 --> 16:07.816
Well there ain't no
evidence in there.

16:07.849 --> 16:09.818
I figured.

16:09.850 --> 16:11.552
<i>What, you figured?</i>

16:11.586 --> 16:13.520
- Ah, gah...
- <i>We gotta be sure.</i>

16:13.553 --> 16:15.723
- Yeah, he's right.
- <i>Well...</i>

16:15.756 --> 16:18.692
In six months,
nothing.

16:18.725 --> 16:20.861
<i>Then on the busiest
day of the year,</i>

16:20.894 --> 16:22.864
a robbery and a
murder to boot!

16:22.897 --> 16:25.333
When it rains
it pours.

16:25.365 --> 16:28.602
- Where you going?
- Find Lem.

16:28.635 --> 16:30.938
<i>Clock is ticking.</i>

16:30.971 --> 16:32.973
I think I left my...
phone in there.

17:44.679 --> 17:46.681
You lost?

17:46.713 --> 17:47.982
Lem Keagan
live up there?

17:50.684 --> 17:53.087
All right, Sheriff.

17:53.121 --> 17:55.090
I didn't recognize you from
your picture in the paper.

17:55.123 --> 17:58.093
Yes sir, right up
that road right there.

17:58.125 --> 17:59.760
It's not on the map, it's right
up there make that right.

18:02.963 --> 18:05.966
I thought...

18:06.000 --> 18:08.603
I thought we'd check on
him once we heard but...

18:08.635 --> 18:10.439
I figure a man
needs his moment.

18:14.107 --> 18:17.544
Were you there
at the festival?

18:17.577 --> 18:18.879
I had a heifer in the
red angus competition.

18:22.650 --> 18:23.884
What's your name?

18:23.917 --> 18:27.554
Jim, Jim Pierce.

18:27.587 --> 18:27.989
Nice to meet
you, Jim.

18:28.021 --> 18:30.759
Yes sir.

18:30.791 --> 18:31.692
Right up there?

18:31.726 --> 18:33.161
Yep, a long way
up there.

18:35.896 --> 18:36.830
<i>Becky, I just ran into Nancy's</i>

18:36.864 --> 18:39.100
<i>husband, Jim Pierce.</i>

18:39.133 --> 18:43.704
<i>He was at the festival,
put him on the list.</i>

18:43.738 --> 18:48.009
<i>I'm gonna search the perimeter
before dark and check on Lem.</i>

18:48.041 --> 18:48.742
<i>10-4, Sheriff.</i>

19:22.609 --> 19:24.077
<i>What
were you thinking idiot?</i>

19:24.111 --> 19:26.514
Hello?

19:26.547 --> 19:29.918
Sheriff's department.

19:32.220 --> 19:33.988
<i>Hello?</i>

19:34.020 --> 19:35.656
<i>You can't back down now!</i>

19:35.690 --> 19:37.491
<i>It doesn't work that way!</i>

19:41.194 --> 19:45.599
<i>Look man, we had a plan
and now you just like...</i>

19:45.633 --> 19:49.604
<i>I lose money because of this!</i>

19:49.636 --> 19:50.804
<i>I'm gonna kill you!</i>

19:55.076 --> 19:56.810
<i>You're dead!</i>

19:56.844 --> 19:58.947
<i>So dead!</i>

20:00.981 --> 20:03.084
I'm gonna kill you!

20:03.116 --> 20:05.953
What were you
thinking, you idiot!

20:09.990 --> 20:13.260
This is why we prac-

20:13.294 --> 20:15.697
- Wh... who are you?
- <i>Sheriff Wise.</i>

20:15.730 --> 20:16.698
<i>What's going on?</i>

20:16.730 --> 20:19.701
Lem Keagan?

20:19.733 --> 20:21.769
Yeah.

20:21.801 --> 20:23.103
<i>What?</i>

20:27.875 --> 20:29.243
What happened?

20:36.884 --> 20:41.021
Is there a number I can call, a
family member to reach out to?

20:41.055 --> 20:42.824
No.

20:42.856 --> 20:45.093
Viv was all I had.

20:45.125 --> 20:46.494
She was my
only family.

20:50.064 --> 20:51.066
<i>Were you here
all day?</i>

20:55.169 --> 20:57.872
Is there someone that
could vouch for that?

20:57.904 --> 21:01.041
I can shoot you a
pic of my game log.

21:01.075 --> 21:02.911
Is there a <i>human</i> that
could vouch for that?

21:02.943 --> 21:05.145
My buddy in Tulsa.

21:05.179 --> 21:07.649
We'd been playing
for hours, so-

21:07.682 --> 21:10.183
He could tell you.

21:14.922 --> 21:16.924
Is there anyone you could
think of that would

21:16.958 --> 21:18.625
do something like this?

21:18.659 --> 21:19.928
Kill my wife?

21:22.930 --> 21:24.065
We never should've
moved here.

21:28.736 --> 21:32.574
Old man Cliff
McGrath...

21:32.606 --> 21:34.875
- <i>the rattlesnake.</i>
- Your father-in-law?

21:38.813 --> 21:40.148
<i>You think he
could've done it?</i>

21:40.181 --> 21:41.583
Yeah, I despise
that man.

21:45.019 --> 21:47.622
I'm gonna go pay
him a little visit.

21:47.654 --> 21:48.855
Where's my keys?

21:54.095 --> 21:55.797
If you drive,
I'll arrest you.

22:00.300 --> 22:03.104
Yeah, yeah.

22:03.136 --> 22:05.306
I'm not going
anywhere Sheriff.

22:05.338 --> 22:07.240
Give me the keys.

22:07.273 --> 22:08.242
I'll get your statement
in the morning.

22:12.313 --> 22:14.682
Sober up.

22:31.999 --> 22:33.901
More coffee?

22:33.933 --> 22:35.636
<i>Thank you.</i>

22:45.011 --> 22:46.681
Thompson,
can you check for me...

22:53.688 --> 22:57.025
Thanks for letting us use-

22:57.057 --> 23:00.394
Than... Thanks for letting us-

23:00.428 --> 23:04.732
Thanks for letting us use the
diner as an office, Elli girl.

23:04.765 --> 23:07.669
Elli girl, that's stupid.

23:07.701 --> 23:09.403
How about we grab
dinner sometime?

23:09.436 --> 23:12.205
Like old times?

23:12.239 --> 23:13.875
Old times, old times...

23:13.907 --> 23:15.809
Old times is like bad times.

23:15.843 --> 23:17.445
You want to go dancing?

23:17.478 --> 23:18.913
You love to dance.

23:18.945 --> 23:20.747
I've been practicing my moves.

23:20.780 --> 23:22.750
Yeah, come on.

23:22.782 --> 23:24.451
You can do this...

23:24.484 --> 23:25.986
Justin.

23:26.019 --> 23:28.789
You can... You can do this.

23:28.823 --> 23:30.191
You can... You can do this.

23:39.266 --> 23:41.236
You ever heard of
courtesy flush?

23:45.038 --> 23:47.375
We all know the town hated her.

23:47.407 --> 23:49.743
And I've heard you say most
people kill out of passion.

23:49.777 --> 23:51.813
But, I think she died
<i>because</i> of that land.

23:54.115 --> 23:55.782
Look at this.

23:55.816 --> 23:58.251
It's massive.

23:58.285 --> 24:01.189
Practically its own county.

24:01.221 --> 24:03.124
She owned
all that land?

24:03.156 --> 24:05.058
Every stick and stone.

24:05.092 --> 24:06.461
Even her husband didn't
have any shares.

24:06.493 --> 24:09.297
Yeah,
she was leveraged big time.

24:09.329 --> 24:12.299
Banks trusted her, had investors
eating out of her hand.

24:12.333 --> 24:17.238
Yeah, she made a
down payment of...

24:17.270 --> 24:19.807
two and a quarter million
to start construction

24:19.839 --> 24:22.843
on the clubhouse and
the first nine homes.

24:22.876 --> 24:23.944
How much did
the land cost?

24:23.978 --> 24:25.813
Not a penny.

24:25.846 --> 24:28.082
Daddy McGrath.

24:28.115 --> 24:29.884
So <i>he</i> owned all this?

24:29.916 --> 24:32.319
<i>Yep, sure did.</i>

24:32.353 --> 24:33.955
<i>Well where is
he at in all of this?</i>

24:33.988 --> 24:35.923
She pulled a Jacob and Esau.

24:35.955 --> 24:38.759
Tricked him out of it.

24:38.792 --> 24:40.761
<i>He was having
some trouble with the IRS.</i>

24:40.795 --> 24:42.997
He transferred it all to her,
but when he settled it

24:43.029 --> 24:45.066
she didn't give it back.

24:45.098 --> 24:50.137
The way I see it,
either she finagled him,

24:50.171 --> 24:53.141
she deceived him or,
I don't know...

24:53.173 --> 24:56.109
Maybe he just
trusted her too much.

24:56.143 --> 24:58.112
<i>All right,
coconut for the lady.</i>

24:58.144 --> 24:59.913
Pecan for the gent,
apple for the Sheriff.

24:59.946 --> 25:00.981
Courtesy of the chef.

25:03.851 --> 25:04.385
Oh!

25:04.417 --> 25:05.986
Oh, here.

25:10.891 --> 25:12.493
Viv...

25:16.230 --> 25:19.500
I'm sorry you had
to see that ma'am.

25:19.532 --> 25:20.934
You knew her?

25:24.571 --> 25:29.142
We played softball
together in high school.

25:29.175 --> 25:32.413
I always thought of her
as too big for Blue Ridge.

25:32.445 --> 25:33.880
I'll get you
some coffee.

25:38.618 --> 25:40.020
Who are the suspects?

25:40.054 --> 25:42.256
M'm...

25:42.288 --> 25:44.892
old man McGrath,
disgruntled father.

25:44.924 --> 25:48.261
Betrayal.

25:48.295 --> 25:51.164
If she dies according
to NC law, half the land

25:51.198 --> 25:52.834
reverts back to him.

25:52.866 --> 25:55.036
The other half...

25:55.068 --> 25:56.203
her husband.

25:58.939 --> 26:01.042
He has an alibi.

26:01.075 --> 26:03.544
Ever heard of
the three day rule?

26:03.576 --> 26:05.011
Isn't that when a lady gives
you her number and you've got

26:05.045 --> 26:07.315
three days to call her back?

26:07.347 --> 26:10.451
<i>In North Carolina,
you stand to inherit...</i>

26:10.483 --> 26:13.186
you gotta outlive the
deceased by three days.

26:13.220 --> 26:14.855
<i>Else, next in line
gets their share.</i>

26:14.888 --> 26:15.522
<i>It's the three day rule.</i>

26:18.392 --> 26:20.161
Maybe we
should meet somewhere else.

26:20.193 --> 26:22.930
I like the coffee.

26:25.031 --> 26:26.233
All right...

26:29.002 --> 26:30.203
We need to figure out what
happened to Vivian when

26:30.237 --> 26:33.341
she left the stage.

26:33.374 --> 26:35.442
We need to set up a
tip-line at the station.

26:35.476 --> 26:38.346
We need to ask the Mayor
to loan us some floaters.

26:38.378 --> 26:41.414
And we need to stay on Lem.

26:41.448 --> 26:43.951
Make sure that he doesn't
have any <i>accidents.</i>

26:45.586 --> 26:47.054
I'll do it.

26:47.086 --> 26:48.923
<i>I'll</i> do it.

26:48.955 --> 26:50.891
Elli's got
Maddie tonight.

26:50.924 --> 26:52.192
You guys go home
and get some sleep.

26:52.226 --> 26:55.363
Relieve me in the morning.

26:55.395 --> 26:57.063
I'm gonna settle up here.

26:57.096 --> 26:58.298
Yeah, you will.

27:03.503 --> 27:05.639
You two are too
comfortable.

27:05.673 --> 27:08.108
Ha-ha!

27:08.142 --> 27:10.244
You need to respect
your elders.

27:13.212 --> 27:14.214
<i>Yeah you will.</i>

27:18.117 --> 27:19.552
You ready?

27:19.586 --> 27:22.323
- How much I owe ya?
- Mmm...

27:22.355 --> 27:25.026
$8.43...

27:25.058 --> 27:26.326
<i>That's it?</i>

27:26.359 --> 27:28.194
I gave you the
military discount.

27:28.228 --> 27:30.163
Elli no, we're
working here.

27:30.196 --> 27:32.032
It's all right.

27:40.173 --> 27:41.975
The town tipping
me now, too?

27:42.009 --> 27:45.680
No, that's all me.

27:49.048 --> 27:51.051
Oh wow, Sheriff.

27:51.085 --> 27:53.688
I mean, you really gotta
work on your pick-up lines.

27:53.721 --> 27:55.623
It's awful.

27:59.192 --> 28:00.560
Will-

28:00.594 --> 28:03.364
Will you...

28:03.396 --> 28:05.465
will you go out...

28:08.335 --> 28:11.138
Justin... how long
have you been here?

28:11.171 --> 28:13.507
- Seven months.
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

28:13.539 --> 28:15.710
<i>And how many friends
have you made?</i>

28:15.742 --> 28:18.346
I mean, besides me and
Maddie and my parents.

28:21.080 --> 28:22.716
Becky...

28:22.750 --> 28:24.417
Thompson...

28:24.451 --> 28:25.987
They work for you.

28:29.789 --> 28:32.225
So is that a no?

28:32.259 --> 28:34.627
Justin...

28:34.661 --> 28:36.464
<i>I have seen you run
head first into danger</i>

28:36.497 --> 28:39.600
more times than
I can count.

28:39.633 --> 28:42.403
You're the bravest man I've
ever known and now here

28:42.435 --> 28:43.503
you are nervous asking me out.

28:46.240 --> 28:48.608
Well...

28:48.642 --> 28:50.510
<i>Justin, we were
together for 10 years.</i>

28:50.544 --> 28:52.213
We have a kid together;
I make you nervous?

28:52.246 --> 28:54.115
That's a good thing.

28:57.518 --> 28:59.185
It was never
you, okay?

28:59.219 --> 29:00.453
It was...

29:00.487 --> 29:01.689
- The excitement?
- <i>No!</i>

29:01.721 --> 29:03.289
It's danger.

29:03.323 --> 29:04.492
Well it's a small town now.

29:04.525 --> 29:05.759
It's small town problems.

29:05.792 --> 29:07.327
Murder.

29:07.361 --> 29:11.232
I'll quit.

29:11.265 --> 29:13.300
What are you
gonna do, hmm?

29:13.333 --> 29:16.537
You gonna be a
JV football coach?

29:16.569 --> 29:20.273
Just give me
a chance.

29:20.307 --> 29:23.076
Justin...

29:23.109 --> 29:24.577
All right,
how about this.

29:24.611 --> 29:27.248
How about you solve
the case, okay?

29:27.280 --> 29:29.250
And then you
relax a little?

29:29.282 --> 29:31.818
Just settle down.

29:31.852 --> 29:34.721
Then we'll see.

29:34.755 --> 29:35.757
We'll see?

29:38.392 --> 29:40.528
We'll see.

29:40.560 --> 29:43.496
Stop - We'll see.

29:43.529 --> 29:45.298
- I gotta go get Maddie.
- We'll see?

29:45.332 --> 29:47.802
- Stop it.
- We'll see.

29:54.307 --> 29:55.608
<i>Pullin' up to Lem's house.</i>

29:55.642 --> 29:57.244
<i>I'll call in if
I see anything.</i>

29:57.277 --> 29:58.479
<i>Over and out.</i>

30:07.453 --> 30:09.423
Sleep tight, Lem.

30:15.596 --> 30:17.631
<i>After trying
both and considering...</i>

30:17.663 --> 30:19.133
<i>I think I like
honey buns better.</i>

30:19.165 --> 30:21.268
<i>Good call!</i>

30:21.300 --> 30:23.169
<i>Next time we'll microwave
it for about 10 seconds.</i>

30:23.202 --> 30:24.437
<i>Change your life.</i>

30:29.242 --> 30:31.177
<i>So any boys I need to
take to jail for you?</i>

30:31.211 --> 30:33.447
<i>Maybe...</i>

30:33.480 --> 30:35.716
<i>We'll see.</i>

30:35.749 --> 30:36.283
<i>There's this one boy
that I like but...</i>

30:36.316 --> 30:37.750
he doesn't know I exist.

30:37.784 --> 30:39.087
Good.

30:42.288 --> 30:43.356
Are you working?

30:43.390 --> 30:45.359
No.

30:48.761 --> 30:53.533
Busted... no wonder we don't go
to that other trail like always.

30:53.567 --> 30:56.436
That's someone's
daughter...

30:56.470 --> 30:58.471
And it's my job-

30:58.505 --> 30:59.840
It's my job to
figure out...

30:59.873 --> 31:02.576
who harmed her.

31:02.608 --> 31:04.511
I get it but...

31:04.545 --> 31:05.746
you've got too
much going on.

31:05.778 --> 31:08.348
You moved here
to slow it down.

31:08.382 --> 31:09.884
No, I moved here
to be with you.

31:09.916 --> 31:12.385
And it will slow down.

31:12.419 --> 31:13.487
Well at least you're
not far away.

31:13.519 --> 31:17.157
That's the spirit.

31:17.191 --> 31:18.759
I can't believe you
didn't tell me first.

31:18.791 --> 31:20.627
I should've been
the first one to know.

31:20.661 --> 31:22.763
You're right,
I'm sorry.

31:22.796 --> 31:25.298
Uh, I got to get
back to mom's.

31:25.332 --> 31:26.333
How about the same
time tomorrow?

31:26.365 --> 31:27.902
<i>I'd like that.</i>

31:35.275 --> 31:38.579
<i>Okay you two, keep it safe.</i>

31:38.612 --> 31:40.346
<i>Let me know when you
need any help.</i>

31:40.380 --> 31:42.316
<i>Deputy 2 will come a'callin'.</i>

31:53.826 --> 31:55.429
Is that a
church bell?

31:55.461 --> 31:58.632
Something like it.

31:58.664 --> 32:00.334
It's not Sunday.

32:00.366 --> 32:01.434
Who are these yahoos?

32:01.468 --> 32:04.438
It's for Vivian.

32:04.471 --> 32:07.208
McGrath's Appalachian
roots run deep.

32:07.240 --> 32:09.276
It's tradition to ring
the bell for every year

32:09.308 --> 32:11.545
the deceased lived.

32:11.577 --> 32:12.913
Calls the neighbors
and family together.

32:15.582 --> 32:18.385
What are you trying
to tell me?

32:18.417 --> 32:21.254
I'm telling you, we're about
to walk into a backwoods wake

32:21.288 --> 32:23.824
filled with moonshine swillin'
fiends who won't take kindly

32:23.856 --> 32:25.526
to an outsider's justice.

32:28.327 --> 32:30.330
Got it.

32:30.364 --> 32:31.332
Stay here.

32:35.001 --> 32:36.869
<i>Hey fellas, I'm looking
for the old man.</i>

32:36.903 --> 32:38.505
<i>I'm gonna kill you...</i>

32:38.538 --> 32:40.807
and keep that
badge as a trophy.

32:40.840 --> 32:42.242
<i>Hey!</i>

32:56.823 --> 32:57.825
Can you help me get
them in the trunk?

32:57.857 --> 32:59.525
Uh-yep.

33:33.426 --> 33:34.994
McGrath?

33:38.932 --> 33:40.367
- <i>McGrath?</i>
- Get out.

33:41.835 --> 33:44.538
Go...

33:44.570 --> 33:45.738
Come on.

33:45.771 --> 33:47.073
<i>McGrath?</i>

33:50.477 --> 33:52.379
Get in the house!

33:52.412 --> 33:53.780
Go and cut me a switch.

33:57.416 --> 33:58.685
How'd you get past my men?

34:01.654 --> 34:03.790
What you want, boy?

34:03.824 --> 34:05.426
Can I have a moment
in private?

34:09.896 --> 34:11.864
These are all my kin, it's
about as private as it gets.

34:14.735 --> 34:18.938
Sorry for your loss.

34:18.972 --> 34:23.777
<i>My condolences to you,
and to your family.</i>

34:23.809 --> 34:25.578
<i>You have any idea
who may have done this?</i>

34:25.612 --> 34:29.083
I can't imagine.

34:29.114 --> 34:33.686
Your daughter's plans for the
property weren't too popular.

34:33.719 --> 34:36.422
- <i>You think that had something to with it?</i>
- Maybe.

34:36.456 --> 34:37.757
Would it surprise you
if someone suggested that

34:37.791 --> 34:39.592
<i>you</i> may have done this?

34:51.905 --> 34:54.108
Well if you want to find
suspects you can start

34:54.141 --> 34:57.711
flippin' rocks over
all over Blue Ridge.

34:57.744 --> 35:00.047
You didn't answer the
question, Mr. McGrath.

35:00.079 --> 35:04.518
How old is your
daughter, Sheriff?

35:04.550 --> 35:06.652
<i>When my little girl was young</i>

35:06.686 --> 35:09.757
we were about as close...

35:09.789 --> 35:12.425
as a father can get
to his daughter.

35:15.161 --> 35:17.364
I loved her.

35:20.099 --> 35:22.835
<i>But...</i>

35:22.869 --> 35:25.873
when a man leaves this life

35:25.905 --> 35:29.876
all he has left is his legacy.

35:29.909 --> 35:31.911
<i>That's all he has.</i>

35:34.614 --> 35:39.720
And this land is McGrath legacy.

35:39.753 --> 35:45.626
We've had this land long before
Sherman marched to the ocean.

35:45.659 --> 35:46.794
<i>But...</i>

35:49.496 --> 35:52.566
my daughter robbed me of that.

35:52.599 --> 35:58.071
<i>She swindled, trashed and
parceled off my legacy.</i>

35:58.103 --> 36:00.573
<i>Well, it's yours again.</i>

36:00.606 --> 36:02.976
At least half of it.

36:03.009 --> 36:05.579
<i>Your son-in-law
has the other half.</i>

36:05.612 --> 36:07.815
Good day, Sheriff.

36:07.847 --> 36:11.050
You didn't answer
the question!

36:11.083 --> 36:12.819
Did you kill
your daughter?

36:16.556 --> 36:19.525
It's just land Sheriff.

36:19.559 --> 36:21.061
It's just land.

36:25.898 --> 36:29.936
<i>And Sheriff...</i>

36:29.969 --> 36:35.775
I'm gonna give you three
days to find her killer.

36:35.809 --> 36:40.113
<i>And if those so-called
badgers can't do the work...</i>

36:40.146 --> 36:43.550
Mountain justice
is gonna take over.

36:43.583 --> 36:45.985
And I will guarantee you

36:46.018 --> 36:48.821
that these mountains will burn!

37:03.003 --> 37:04.505
<i>You heard the old man.</i>

37:04.538 --> 37:06.106
<i>We got three days.</i>

37:06.139 --> 37:07.708
<i>That killer's out there, Becky.</i>

37:07.740 --> 37:09.909
Here you go, Justin.

37:09.943 --> 37:11.711
- Appreciate it, Harvey.
- Yeah, absolutely.

37:11.744 --> 37:13.279
Ah, it's the least
I can do man.

37:13.313 --> 37:16.016
You saved my store and
probably my life, you know.

37:20.286 --> 37:22.221
How's Penny?

37:22.255 --> 37:24.758
Well, life's taken a few
sharp turns here for us.

37:24.791 --> 37:28.095
Well, we just-

37:28.128 --> 37:30.731
kinda stretched to the limit
if you wanna know the truth,

37:30.764 --> 37:32.065
right now, but we'll
be all right.

37:32.097 --> 37:34.166
We'll be fine,
don't worry about us.

37:34.199 --> 37:37.003
Stop and Save ain't the only
egg in the basket, you know?

37:37.036 --> 37:38.871
So we'll be fine;
we'll be good.

37:38.905 --> 37:40.740
And then as far
as her, she-

37:40.773 --> 37:43.042
She's just worried.

37:43.076 --> 37:45.846
We worry most
about what we love.

37:45.878 --> 37:47.614
Yes sir, yes
sir we do.

37:47.646 --> 37:48.882
Hey, let me let y'all
get back to it there.

37:48.914 --> 37:50.150
If you got any questions
just holler.

37:50.182 --> 37:51.985
- Thank you.
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

37:52.018 --> 37:54.186
So... what
do we have?

37:54.219 --> 37:56.856
I mean, there's no murder
weapon, no witness.

37:56.889 --> 38:00.893
No solid suspects.

38:00.927 --> 38:02.162
<i>Let's see if Thompson has anything.</i>

38:07.333 --> 38:09.268
- Hey boss?
- <i>Did you confirm Lem's alibi?</i>

38:09.302 --> 38:11.637
I been trying.

38:11.670 --> 38:15.174
But Lem doesn't actually
know this guy's real name.

38:15.208 --> 38:17.945
<i>And the gaming company
ain't too keen on passing</i>

38:17.978 --> 38:19.246
<i>out private information</i>

38:19.278 --> 38:21.715
without a warrant.

38:21.748 --> 38:28.255
So Lem's alibi "GunDart468" is
still just an avatar for now.

38:28.288 --> 38:30.958
- Get the warrant.
- <i>We may not need to.</i>

38:30.990 --> 38:34.193
Ah, I got the
sugar in my-

38:34.226 --> 38:34.961
<i>Why is that,
Deputy Thompson?</i>

38:34.994 --> 38:37.063
Uh...

38:37.097 --> 38:39.967
Well we got an anonymous email

38:40.000 --> 38:41.934
<i>through your tip line.</i>

38:41.967 --> 38:43.803
<i>Great idea, Sheriff,
by the way.</i>

38:43.836 --> 38:45.905
<i>With a very interesting photo.</i>

38:45.938 --> 38:47.340
Seems your boy Lem...

38:47.373 --> 38:49.108
lied...

38:49.141 --> 38:51.344
He was at the festival.

38:51.378 --> 38:53.814
You have visual proof that
Lem was at the festival?

38:53.847 --> 38:56.350
<i>Well, the photo
was taken right before or</i>

38:56.382 --> 38:59.085
after the estimated
time of Vivian's death.

38:59.119 --> 39:01.088
Find out who
sent that photo.

39:01.121 --> 39:02.356
Get one of the IT folks
at the library to help.

39:06.259 --> 39:08.695
Copy that!

39:08.728 --> 39:09.829
- He has a crush on one of them.
- <i>What?</i>

39:09.862 --> 39:12.665
Aw, Becky...

39:12.699 --> 39:14.067
<i>Ah, Becky I heard that.</i>

39:14.099 --> 39:15.335
Where's Lem?

39:15.367 --> 39:16.702
At the funeral home.

39:16.735 --> 39:18.304
We're on our way.

39:18.338 --> 39:20.841
Deputy Thompson
don't get no respect.

39:38.291 --> 39:41.995
On a day like
today nobody's out?

39:42.027 --> 39:44.664
It'll stay that way.

39:46.900 --> 39:48.802
There's a killer
on the loose.

39:50.969 --> 39:53.239
<i>Yes ma'am, I understand.</i>

39:53.273 --> 39:56.076
All right.

39:56.108 --> 39:59.278
Yes ma'am, I will tell
him that if I see him.

39:59.311 --> 40:00.313
All right.

40:04.150 --> 40:06.887
Mayor Brady...
said she couldn't find you.

40:06.920 --> 40:08.288
Wanted to know
where you were.

40:08.320 --> 40:09.956
Said she wants an update
on the case asap.

40:09.989 --> 40:12.893
She said, and I quote,

40:12.925 --> 40:14.027
"The town is waiting."

40:14.059 --> 40:16.063
- Is Lem in there?
- Yeah.

40:16.096 --> 40:18.065
Good work.

40:18.097 --> 40:19.166
You find out
who sent this?

40:19.199 --> 40:20.934
Not yet, they're
working on it.

40:20.967 --> 40:23.903
You ask the
IT girl out?

40:23.936 --> 40:26.038
Maybe.

40:26.072 --> 40:27.307
That would
be a no.

40:30.076 --> 40:31.711
What do you
want us to do?

40:31.744 --> 40:33.779
I'll either make an
arrest or I won't.

41:09.882 --> 41:10.850
When's the funeral?

41:10.884 --> 41:12.853
Geez.

41:12.885 --> 41:13.853
You always sneak
up on people?

41:13.887 --> 41:17.858
Sometimes.

41:22.128 --> 41:23.963
You found something.

41:23.996 --> 41:26.031
Your wife's
murdered...

41:26.065 --> 41:28.434
You lied to me about
where you were.

41:28.467 --> 41:32.404
Which just so happens to be the
place where she was murdered.

41:32.438 --> 41:35.208
She knew no one
here liked her.

41:35.240 --> 41:36.976
Treated her like she
was an outsider-

41:37.010 --> 41:39.479
You're floundering, Lem.

41:39.512 --> 41:42.015
You gotta talk
straight to me.

41:42.047 --> 41:43.783
Or I'm gonna
take you in.

41:54.260 --> 41:56.129
She practiced that
speech for weeks.

41:56.161 --> 41:58.030
<i>Our morals are strong.</i>

41:58.063 --> 42:01.867
Our history is even stronger.

42:01.900 --> 42:03.302
No... no, no, no.

42:03.335 --> 42:04.538
What does that even mean?

42:06.572 --> 42:09.041
Stupid speech.

42:09.074 --> 42:11.143
<i>I heard it so many times.</i>

42:11.177 --> 42:13.847
<i>Even I had it memorized.</i>

42:13.880 --> 42:18.285
All that mumbo-jumbo about
the mountains' welcoming arms.

42:18.318 --> 42:19.519
<i>Blue Ridge...</i>

42:19.552 --> 42:22.155
is our home.

42:22.188 --> 42:26.893
And she has wide arms,
welcoming arms...

42:26.925 --> 42:29.228
plenty of room for growth.

42:29.262 --> 42:32.833
Family stands by family.

42:32.865 --> 42:35.134
<i>She just wanted people
to like her, you know?</i>

42:35.168 --> 42:37.971
She just wanted to
break through to them.

42:38.003 --> 42:40.306
I knew it would
never work.

42:40.340 --> 42:43.376
But I'm the outside
looking in, you know?

42:43.409 --> 42:45.612
She wouldn't listen
to me, she never has.

42:48.514 --> 42:52.052
I went there to make sure
that nothing happened to her.

42:52.085 --> 42:53.485
<i>I was worried about her.</i>

42:53.518 --> 42:54.587
<i>I mean you can understand</i>

42:54.621 --> 42:55.922
that, can't you Sheriff?

43:01.960 --> 43:03.429
I just wish she
knew I was there, you know?

43:06.099 --> 43:07.901
She thought differently.

43:12.972 --> 43:15.242
Wait a minute.

43:15.275 --> 43:18.110
That's Elizabeth Wade,
Jeremiah Wade's wife.

43:18.143 --> 43:23.482
Jeremiah Wade,
the musician?

43:23.516 --> 43:25.218
<i>The Wades hate my wife's
family and they always have,</i>

43:25.251 --> 43:27.354
<i>from what I hear.</i>

43:27.387 --> 43:29.089
<i>They used to own that
land back in the day.</i>

43:29.121 --> 43:31.223
And they've always
wanted it back.

43:31.257 --> 43:34.293
They would hound the
old man for decades.

43:34.327 --> 43:37.097
When Vivian got it...
I mean...

43:37.130 --> 43:40.233
We expected to get some bricks
thrown threw the windows and

43:40.266 --> 43:41.568
she was surprised
when we didn't.

43:44.003 --> 43:46.606
And she would talk
to you about this?

43:46.639 --> 43:49.276
You know how families talk
about politics or football?

43:49.309 --> 43:51.244
Yeah.

43:51.277 --> 43:53.679
Well, at the McGrath
family reunion,

43:53.713 --> 43:56.249
all you talk about is
the no-good Wades.

43:58.952 --> 44:01.121
Don't leave town.

44:04.222 --> 44:07.126
Where am I gonna go, sheriff?

44:07.159 --> 44:10.129
I mean yeah, our marriage
wasn't perfect but...

44:10.163 --> 44:12.331
Viv is all I had.

44:25.445 --> 44:27.247
- Old man's holding out.
- McGrath?

44:27.280 --> 44:28.381
I bet he thinks he knows who
did it and

44:28.414 --> 44:31.518
he's not gonna tell an outsider.

44:31.550 --> 44:33.385
<i>And I bet he's gonna kill the
man he thinks did it...</i>

44:33.418 --> 44:36.422
Jeremiah Wade.

44:36.456 --> 44:39.291
The Wade/McGrath feud?
This all a part of that?

44:39.324 --> 44:40.426
It's time to meet Jeremiah.

44:40.460 --> 44:41.594
Give me his whereabouts.

44:41.626 --> 44:43.663
Don't let Lem leave your sight.

44:43.695 --> 44:45.699
Yes, sir.

44:45.731 --> 44:47.300
Come on, I'll take you
to your car, Becky.

45:15.260 --> 45:17.262
Sheriff,
he's in there.

45:25.103 --> 45:28.707
Evening, sheriff.

45:28.740 --> 45:31.210
I can't say as we've
had the pleasure.

45:31.244 --> 45:33.213
I don't believe we have.

45:33.246 --> 45:34.646
I've heard a lot
about you though.

45:34.679 --> 45:36.648
Ex-Green Beret...
Medal of Honor....

45:38.150 --> 45:40.219
May I?

45:44.456 --> 45:47.426
It's beautiful.
Did you make this?

45:47.460 --> 45:50.463
Yeah. Not much
different making a gun

45:50.496 --> 45:53.465
or an instrument when you
get right down to it.

45:53.498 --> 45:55.701
It's all about
shape, structure...

45:55.735 --> 45:57.303
and the purpose.

45:57.335 --> 45:59.171
Purpose?

45:59.204 --> 46:01.106
They both move people.

46:03.141 --> 46:04.476
Do you know why we're here?

46:04.510 --> 46:06.746
Yep, I do.

46:06.778 --> 46:09.548
My wife sent you those photos;
they were supposed to be

46:09.581 --> 46:12.317
anonymous but like
I tell my kids,

46:12.351 --> 46:15.288
nothing on the internet's
anonymous.

46:15.320 --> 46:18.223
And so like a good detective,

46:18.257 --> 46:22.195
you deduce that we sent a photo
that may have pointed

46:22.228 --> 46:26.499
you in the direction of
a potential killer.

46:26.532 --> 46:28.835
And after consulting
with the potential killer-

46:28.867 --> 46:30.670
Suspect.

46:32.605 --> 46:35.340
Fine, suspect.

46:35.373 --> 46:37.810
You've learned...

46:37.844 --> 46:40.480
with of course the help
of your local detectives...

46:40.512 --> 46:42.481
about the problem
between my family,

46:42.514 --> 46:45.184
and the family of
the deceased.

46:45.217 --> 46:48.721
Do I
got another suspect on my list?

46:48.753 --> 46:51.257
Namely me.

46:53.626 --> 46:55.095
That's pretty much the
definition

46:55.128 --> 46:57.297
of cut to the chase.

46:57.329 --> 47:00.299
Very well deduced
I must say.

47:00.333 --> 47:02.668
Well, you don't have
to have two possums in a pot

47:02.702 --> 47:06.739
to know you're cookin'
for two.

47:06.771 --> 47:09.409
Why were you anonymous
with that photo?

47:09.442 --> 47:12.378
And what... ignite an already

47:12.411 --> 47:16.148
combustible feud?
No, thank you.

47:16.181 --> 47:18.317
We just wanna help out
where we can

47:18.351 --> 47:20.887
to find that poor girl justice,

47:20.920 --> 47:23.456
not reignite a war.

47:25.324 --> 47:27.460
A war?
It was that bad, huh?

47:30.329 --> 47:33.466
You <i>are</i> an outsider.

47:33.498 --> 47:35.234
Our family's been fighting
over that land

47:35.268 --> 47:38.371
since the
War of Northern Aggression.

47:38.403 --> 47:41.574
My great, great, great
granddaddy

47:41.606 --> 47:44.344
was cheated out of it
by McGrath.

47:46.179 --> 47:47.680
Where were you at
the time of the murder?

47:47.713 --> 47:50.216
Oh, I don't know.

47:50.248 --> 47:53.218
Somewhere all by myself with
nobody to testify to it.

47:58.456 --> 48:00.726
I took the picture, sheriff.

48:00.760 --> 48:02.896
The mayor's my alibi.

48:02.929 --> 48:04.797
Convenient.

48:07.365 --> 48:09.235
Now would I kill
for that land?

48:12.204 --> 48:15.909
Absolutely.

48:15.942 --> 48:17.943
It's not something I'd
expect an outsider

48:17.976 --> 48:22.848
like you to understand,
but did I?

48:22.882 --> 48:26.219
No.

48:26.251 --> 48:30.190
I did not kill that woman,
nor hire somebody to kill her.

48:30.222 --> 48:32.726
A hitman...
I didn't think of that one.

48:37.563 --> 48:43.235
I'd take a real hard look
into that snake McGrath.

48:43.268 --> 48:46.271
I don't care if she
<i>was</i> his daughter.

48:46.304 --> 48:50.275
That man is one land-hungry
son of a gun.

48:52.711 --> 48:54.646
Don't leave town.

49:02.954 --> 49:08.360
<i>Jeremiah Wade, what a creep.</i>

49:08.393 --> 49:10.596
He says the mayor's his alibi.

49:10.630 --> 49:11.864
Nah,
he wouldn't get his hand dirty.

49:11.896 --> 49:13.967
He'd pay someone to do it...

49:14.000 --> 49:16.668
send in the photo to frame a
McGrath.

49:16.702 --> 49:18.871
Lem's a Keagan,
not a McGrath.

49:18.903 --> 49:20.840
If Lem gets jailed,
he has a better shot of getting

49:20.873 --> 49:23.742
that land off the old man.

49:23.775 --> 49:26.545
<i>He wants that land;
he hates the family.</i>

49:26.579 --> 49:28.981
What other motives
do we need?

49:29.014 --> 49:30.717
We're not short on
motives, we're short on evidence.

49:35.721 --> 49:37.724
Well...

49:37.757 --> 49:41.561
Old man McGrath...

49:41.594 --> 49:43.028
disappeared.

49:43.061 --> 49:44.264
What?

49:47.365 --> 49:51.304
Yep... and no one's
heard from him all afternoon.

49:51.336 --> 49:52.739
Who's watching Lem?

49:54.472 --> 49:55.875
Pardon?

49:55.907 --> 49:59.344
If you're here,
then...

50:02.380 --> 50:03.882
<i>Deputy...</i>

50:06.485 --> 50:08.521
No, I was lookin' for McGrath;
dispatch was supposed

50:08.554 --> 50:10.822
to call me back with
a floater-

50:10.856 --> 50:13.293
We're understaffed sheriff!

50:13.326 --> 50:14.894
Get in the car, Thompson.

50:32.510 --> 50:35.981
Lem? Lem?

50:38.884 --> 50:41.387
Lem?

50:41.420 --> 50:42.488
Becky, search downstairs.

50:42.521 --> 50:44.390
Thompson, upstairs.

51:13.452 --> 51:15.755
<i>Should I call an ambulance?</i>

51:15.788 --> 51:16.856
<i>You should call
the coroner.</i>

51:40.612 --> 51:41.714
This is my fault.

51:45.583 --> 51:46.885
He's dead because of me.

51:52.023 --> 51:55.060
He's dead because there's
bad people in this world.

51:55.094 --> 51:57.028
And you're not one of them.

52:05.003 --> 52:06.373
Hey...

52:12.911 --> 52:15.514
Find Cliff McGrath.

52:15.547 --> 52:18.550
The son-in-law's dead and that
means he's the

52:18.583 --> 52:23.588
sole owner of that land,
and the #1 suspect.

52:23.621 --> 52:26.893
You find him...

52:26.925 --> 52:29.027
and you bring him in.

52:45.043 --> 52:47.712
<i>Do you know anyone
in ballistics?</i>

52:47.746 --> 52:49.782
My roommate
from the academy.

52:49.815 --> 52:51.784
She's in Raleigh now.

52:51.817 --> 52:54.554
Does she owe you
any favors?

52:54.586 --> 52:55.954
No, but I'll put it
on my tab.

52:59.492 --> 53:03.963
With a bullet,
we can trace it back to a gun.

53:03.996 --> 53:05.932
The killer just made
their first mistake.

53:12.704 --> 53:14.172
Freeze!

53:14.206 --> 53:16.108
Hey!

53:16.141 --> 53:17.809
Becky, stay with the body.

53:21.213 --> 53:23.583
Police! Freeze!

53:25.951 --> 53:28.086
Stop! I said stop!

53:31.222 --> 53:33.558
Stop! Police!

53:35.860 --> 53:37.963
Stop!

53:46.739 --> 53:48.840
Where'd she go?

53:56.882 --> 53:58.717
<i>Pierce's cows.</i>

54:18.170 --> 54:19.739
<i>Get in the house, quick!
Someone's coming!</i>

54:32.351 --> 54:34.987
Evening, Jim.

54:35.019 --> 54:37.289
Evening, sheriff.

54:37.322 --> 54:40.559
You lost again?

54:40.592 --> 54:43.862
Is your wife home?

54:43.896 --> 54:45.164
What does she got to do
with anything?

54:50.702 --> 54:51.670
Do you know what
happened to Lem?

54:55.007 --> 54:56.142
You don't have to be Matlock
to know what all those

54:56.175 --> 54:58.911
police lights mean.

54:58.943 --> 55:01.179
Something bad happened.

55:01.213 --> 55:03.649
Can you call your wife out?

55:03.681 --> 55:04.317
I'm not gonna ask you again.

55:07.885 --> 55:12.757
Nancy, darling...
come on out here.

55:17.929 --> 55:20.231
What's all this?

55:20.264 --> 55:21.266
Have you been here
all evening?

55:21.300 --> 55:22.702
All night.

55:29.775 --> 55:32.345
Like he said.

55:32.378 --> 55:34.246
Did you hear or see
anything suspicious?

55:36.681 --> 55:38.783
A gunshot.

55:41.286 --> 55:43.722
You didn't
call it in?

55:45.257 --> 55:48.226
Sheriff, this is Blue Ridge.

55:48.260 --> 55:51.230
Gunshots are like copperheads;
they're everywhere.

55:51.262 --> 55:53.932
<i>Ain't nobody hollerin'
unless they're bit.</i>

55:57.769 --> 56:00.172
You didn't... stop by?

56:00.204 --> 56:03.909
What you pokin' at, sheriff?

56:03.942 --> 56:05.844
There was a man
murdered tonight.

56:09.882 --> 56:12.385
I'm just doing my job.

56:12.418 --> 56:14.019
So you are.

56:24.829 --> 56:26.364
<i>Thompson and
Becky, meet me at the diner in ten.</i>

56:26.398 --> 56:28.134
<i>Let's get the mayor
there too.</i>

56:28.166 --> 56:29.302
<i>Copy, sheriff.</i>

56:32.438 --> 56:34.940
<i>I got your call sheriff.
So what do you have?</i>

56:34.972 --> 56:36.942
<i>When I was in the army,</i>

56:36.974 --> 56:39.377
<i>I was stationed in the
desert a lot and when you're</i>

56:39.411 --> 56:41.146
in the desert,
you think about one thing

56:41.179 --> 56:43.682
over and over and
over again...

56:43.715 --> 56:45.351
water.

56:48.820 --> 56:52.023
<i>Water is the most vital
necessity on this planet.</i>

56:52.056 --> 56:54.459
See this?
Know what that is?

56:54.492 --> 56:56.996
It looks like
Vivian's land.

56:57.028 --> 56:59.764
That's the future
Eagle's Nest Gold Resort.

56:59.797 --> 57:02.467
See this?
That line going through there?

57:02.501 --> 57:06.839
That's the river that
runs through it.

57:06.871 --> 57:10.076
<i>Plenty of maps have rivers,
so why would you kill for it?</i>

57:10.108 --> 57:12.043
<i>I thought I'd take
a look for myself.</i>

57:12.077 --> 57:14.313
It's the only water
for miles.

57:14.346 --> 57:15.146
What does this have
to do with anything?

57:15.179 --> 57:16.081
Water rights.

57:16.114 --> 57:18.317
What?

57:18.349 --> 57:20.719
<i>The right to use
the water.</i>

57:20.753 --> 57:23.722
<i>When I was in the desert,
people would kill for water.</i>

57:23.755 --> 57:26.091
<i>And who would kill for water
in the Blue Ridge Mountains?</i>

57:26.125 --> 57:28.126
<i>Someone whose livelihood</i>

57:28.159 --> 57:32.797
<i>came from that water...
farmers.</i>

57:32.831 --> 57:35.134
So Mayor, I've got the warrant
for the arrest of

57:35.166 --> 57:36.969
Jim and Nancy Pierce.

57:37.001 --> 57:39.371
<i>What?</i>

57:39.403 --> 57:42.108
<i>Our prime suspects
are the Pierces.</i>

57:42.141 --> 57:44.744
<i>When I went to the river,
I saw it.</i>

57:44.777 --> 57:46.878
<i>I saw Pierce's cows
drinking from the river.</i>

57:46.911 --> 57:50.849
<i>And without water,
the cows will die.</i>

57:50.882 --> 57:53.284
<i>Kill or go broke.</i>

57:53.318 --> 57:55.086
<i>But don't they lease that land?</i>

57:55.119 --> 57:56.087
This is the lease agreement

57:56.121 --> 57:58.324
between McGrath and the Pierces

57:58.356 --> 58:01.159
for 5 years guaranteed
water rights.

58:01.193 --> 58:04.263
But see this?
The golf resort gets in the way.

58:04.295 --> 58:05.830
Because you can't have a cow
drinking out of a water

58:05.864 --> 58:07.967
hazard on the 14th hole.

58:08.000 --> 58:09.335
So you're trying to tell
me they killed Vivian

58:09.367 --> 58:12.137
and her husband over water,
over cows?

58:12.170 --> 58:15.073
Well, ain't this a surprise.

58:15.106 --> 58:19.010
Mayor... sheriff.

58:19.043 --> 58:22.413
<i>Jeremiah.</i>

58:22.447 --> 58:24.884
So you said you got a
warrant for a broken lease.

58:24.916 --> 58:26.918
<i>Nancy found
Vivian's body,</i>

58:26.952 --> 58:29.822
<i>and she was also at Lem's
crime scene.</i>

58:29.855 --> 58:30.990
<i>Look, just don't swing
and miss because you</i>

58:31.023 --> 58:32.925
<i>don't get 3 strikes with
this, okay?</i>

58:34.927 --> 58:36.262
Hi, Jeremiah.

58:36.295 --> 58:39.030
With pleasure, ma'am.

58:39.063 --> 58:40.565
I heard back from my roommate...

58:40.599 --> 58:43.001
about the ballistics on
the killer's gun.

58:43.034 --> 58:45.370
What's next, sheriff?

58:45.403 --> 58:48.440
We finish it.

58:48.472 --> 58:50.009
<i>We gotta end this before
someone else gets killed.</i>

58:58.016 --> 59:00.820
Wades... filthy Wades.

59:10.461 --> 59:13.833
Maddie, go in the bathroom
and lock the door.

59:13.865 --> 59:16.168
- O-kay.
- Go!

59:27.913 --> 59:29.248
Really?

59:29.280 --> 59:33.619
Yeah, really.

59:33.652 --> 59:35.920
You killed my Vivian.

59:35.954 --> 59:38.123
What are you talkin' about?

59:38.155 --> 59:40.092
Now I'm gonna kill <i>you.</i>

59:47.365 --> 59:50.436
You're drunk.

59:50.469 --> 59:54.874
You thought you'd
get it back... my land.

59:54.907 --> 01:00:00.512
But no, you ain't gonna
never see it.

01:00:00.545 --> 01:00:02.114
From what I
understand,

01:00:02.146 --> 01:00:04.916
if I <i>had</i> killed your Vivian...

01:00:04.949 --> 01:00:06.317
I'd be doing you a favor.

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:09.588
<i>You murderer, I'll kill you!</i>

01:00:09.621 --> 01:00:11.657
Hey! Hey!!!

01:00:11.690 --> 01:00:12.458
You take this to the
mountain boys,

01:00:12.490 --> 01:00:15.360
not here... you hear me?

01:00:18.563 --> 01:00:20.398
Not in my place.

01:00:26.538 --> 01:00:28.539
Just centuries of cussin'
and fightin' and feudin'

01:00:28.572 --> 01:00:30.909
and you think it's
all gonna end here,

01:00:30.943 --> 01:00:33.946
right here in this booth?
In front of all these people?

01:00:33.978 --> 01:00:37.115
You're idiots...

01:00:37.148 --> 01:00:40.251
<i>the lot of you.</i>

01:00:40.284 --> 01:00:45.023
Cliff, you're drunk.
Out.

01:00:47.025 --> 01:00:49.260
Out!

01:00:53.532 --> 01:00:56.268
I'm gonna be waiting
for you outside.

01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:57.101
Mm-hmm.

01:00:57.135 --> 01:00:59.138
MM-hmm.

01:01:03.708 --> 01:01:06.210
Go sober up.

01:01:09.181 --> 01:01:11.684
And what are you gonna do?

01:01:11.717 --> 01:01:14.452
Well, I'm gonna drink
my coffee of course.

01:01:31.469 --> 01:01:34.672
Come down to Elli's Diner.

01:01:34.706 --> 01:01:35.374
We're gonna finish something
that I should

01:01:35.407 --> 01:01:37.509
have finished a long time ago.

01:01:49.588 --> 01:01:50.389
You two go around the back.

01:01:50.422 --> 01:01:53.592
Keep your heads.

01:01:53.625 --> 01:01:57.496
Handcuffs... not body bags.
Let's roll.

01:02:03.802 --> 01:02:05.137
<i>Head out the back, Nancy.
I'll scare 'em off.</i>

01:02:07.172 --> 01:02:07.740
Alright, you bushwhackers,
get off my-

01:02:10.242 --> 01:02:12.144
A heck of a way
to greet a solicitor.

01:02:12.177 --> 01:02:14.613
And it's loaded.

01:02:14.646 --> 01:02:17.115
<i>Sheriff, I didn't know it
was you.</i>

01:02:17.148 --> 01:02:17.949
She tried to make
a break for it out the back.

01:02:17.983 --> 01:02:19.718
I didn't know it was y'all.

01:02:19.751 --> 01:02:21.487
Do you always answer the
door with a double barrel?

01:02:21.519 --> 01:02:22.755
I do when there's
a murderer on the loose.

01:02:22.788 --> 01:02:25.123
What's this all about?

01:02:25.157 --> 01:02:27.760
- We have a warrant for your arrest and hers.
- What?

01:02:27.793 --> 01:02:30.362
Go inside and check and see if there's
anything that matches ballistics.

01:02:30.394 --> 01:02:33.132
You have the
right to remain silent;

01:02:33.164 --> 01:02:35.467
anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:37.168
You think <i>we</i> murdered Lem?

01:02:37.202 --> 01:02:37.770
You have the right
to an attorney.

01:02:37.802 --> 01:02:40.239
- And Vivian.
- What?!

01:02:40.271 --> 01:02:42.775
Sheriff, we're poor.
You gotta understand.

01:02:42.807 --> 01:02:46.210
That golf course would have
tripled the value of our land.

01:02:46.244 --> 01:02:47.679
We were one of the few that
were alright

01:02:47.711 --> 01:02:49.280
with it being put in.

01:02:51.550 --> 01:02:54.119
What about your cows?

01:02:54.152 --> 01:02:55.586
Cows? Sheriff, I got that
one prize heifer and that's

01:02:55.619 --> 01:02:58.089
more than I can handle.

01:02:58.123 --> 01:03:00.259
I don't have the gumption,
nor the demeanor to deal with

01:03:00.291 --> 01:03:02.494
any more than one of
them dumb animals.

01:03:02.527 --> 01:03:05.664
<i>We lease our land for grazing.</i>

01:03:05.697 --> 01:03:08.267
<i>We lease part of the McGrath
land for water sure but we</i>

01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:10.469
<i>had a deal with the old man.</i>

01:03:10.501 --> 01:03:12.737
<i>A percentage of the money
went to him, okay?</i>

01:03:12.771 --> 01:03:15.307
It was like we said,
the value of the golf course

01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:18.277
surmounts any rent
money from cows!

01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:21.112
Then whose cows are they?

01:03:21.146 --> 01:03:23.649
It's me.

01:03:27.418 --> 01:03:30.154
Oh, pick up.

01:03:30.188 --> 01:03:31.856
Pick up, pick up, pick up.
Come on, Justin.

01:03:31.889 --> 01:03:33.157
<i>This is Justin. Leave it.</i>

01:03:34.592 --> 01:03:35.726
Mom, what's going on?

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:39.565
It's okay.

01:03:39.597 --> 01:03:41.567
<i>Why'd you run from me?</i>

01:03:41.599 --> 01:03:44.302
<i>Because I was scared!
He was dead!</i>

01:03:44.335 --> 01:03:46.604
Becky here.

01:03:46.637 --> 01:03:47.505
<i>Get Justin.
They're gonna kill each other.</i>

01:03:47.539 --> 01:03:49.174
<i>Hurry, please!</i>

01:03:49.206 --> 01:03:50.641
We found McGrath.

01:03:50.675 --> 01:03:52.177
He and Wade are
about to kill each other.

01:03:52.210 --> 01:03:53.744
Maybe I should let 'em.

01:03:53.777 --> 01:03:55.213
They're at Elli's...

01:03:55.246 --> 01:03:56.614
and your family is there.

01:04:12.463 --> 01:04:13.865
Come on out here, you coward!

01:04:16.201 --> 01:04:19.338
Get a taste of the ol'
Blue Ridge hambone!

01:04:19.371 --> 01:04:22.206
<i>You murderer!</i>

01:04:22.239 --> 01:04:23.808
<i>Come out and
face me like a man!</i>

01:04:27.278 --> 01:04:30.215
You killed my daughter.

01:04:30.248 --> 01:04:32.851
We all know you did.
You killed my kin.

01:04:34.786 --> 01:04:36.788
<i>Come on out here, you coward!</i>

01:04:45.664 --> 01:04:47.232
Look up!

01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:57.208
Whoa, look out!

01:04:57.242 --> 01:05:00.579
Whoo!

01:05:00.612 --> 01:05:05.284
Ooh!

01:05:05.317 --> 01:05:08.554
Somebody change my shorts.

01:05:08.586 --> 01:05:09.922
<i>Deputy
Thompson, are you still there?</i>

01:05:09.954 --> 01:05:12.223
Whoo!
Yeah, no problem.

01:05:12.257 --> 01:05:13.291
I'm coming up behind you.

01:05:21.699 --> 01:05:22.733
We're almost there, sheriff.

01:05:22.766 --> 01:05:23.835
Hold on, Elli.

01:05:33.844 --> 01:05:35.880
Wades.

01:05:38.416 --> 01:05:40.818
<i>The filthy Wades!</i>

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:11.315
I should've figured you
couldn't fight your own battles.

01:06:13.485 --> 01:06:14.952
Hoo-ha!

01:06:27.465 --> 01:06:28.600
No!
No, stop! Stop this right now!

01:06:28.632 --> 01:06:30.568
Stay back, Elli.

01:06:30.601 --> 01:06:33.672
This is between me and him.

01:06:33.704 --> 01:06:35.407
Get your skinny butt
outta here.

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:36.907
Not until you put
your guns down.

01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:38.409
Put 'em down!

01:06:38.443 --> 01:06:40.012
Mom! Mom!

01:06:40.045 --> 01:06:42.313
Maddie, you stay back!

01:06:55.793 --> 01:06:57.395
Hey!

01:07:00.998 --> 01:07:02.701
Justin!

01:07:06.538 --> 01:07:09.041
Pointing guns at one another
like it's the Wild West?!

01:07:11.710 --> 01:07:14.012
<i>There's innocent people here.</i>

01:07:14.045 --> 01:07:15.646
There's my family!

01:07:18.717 --> 01:07:21.619
My daughter!
My legacy!

01:07:21.652 --> 01:07:24.355
You had your chance, sheriff...
now it's mountain justice.

01:07:24.389 --> 01:07:26.657
What justice?

01:07:26.690 --> 01:07:27.858
He didn't kill your daughter.

01:07:27.891 --> 01:07:29.594
You liar!

01:07:29.626 --> 01:07:31.529
<i>I have proof.</i>

01:07:31.563 --> 01:07:33.831
He don't care about proof,
sheriff.

01:07:33.864 --> 01:07:37.535
It ain't about that girl,
it's about him finally

01:07:37.568 --> 01:07:40.404
having a reason to
pull that trigger.

01:07:40.438 --> 01:07:42.507
You want this too?

01:07:42.539 --> 01:07:46.545
If he wants blood,
I'll oblige him.

01:07:46.577 --> 01:07:50.849
Then fine...
just you two.

01:07:50.882 --> 01:07:54.653
<i>You wanna be gunslingers,
then so be it.</i>

01:07:54.686 --> 01:07:57.489
But you tell your men to put
down their guns,

01:07:57.521 --> 01:08:00.558
because I'm the law!

01:08:00.592 --> 01:08:01.827
And if you've got
a problem with that,

01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:03.528
you gotta go through me!

01:08:10.735 --> 01:08:13.137
Do it!

01:08:31.956 --> 01:08:34.693
Alright, you kill one another.

01:08:34.725 --> 01:08:37.595
Whichever one of you is
standing,

01:08:37.627 --> 01:08:41.432
I'm gonna arrest for
murder immediately.

01:08:50.041 --> 01:08:53.743
Don't put generations of hate
on your daughter's grave.

01:08:53.778 --> 01:08:57.015
Don't put your failures as a
father on that man.

01:08:57.046 --> 01:09:00.952
He didn't kill your daughter,
I promise you that.

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:07.658
Get back.
Everybody back, back.

01:09:07.692 --> 01:09:09.027
Do you know who killed her, boy?

01:09:50.568 --> 01:09:52.604
No, no, no.

01:09:52.636 --> 01:09:54.972
Face me, you coward!

01:09:55.006 --> 01:09:57.676
This ends here, now!

01:09:57.708 --> 01:10:01.112
Put it down, Jeremiah.

01:10:01.145 --> 01:10:03.482
Put it down or
<i>I'm</i> puttin' it down.

01:10:07.585 --> 01:10:08.987
So what? You're gonna play
big city boy now?

01:10:15.693 --> 01:10:16.962
Get him outta here.

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:58.202
Hey, sheriff.

01:10:58.235 --> 01:11:00.104
Hey, Harvey.

01:11:03.106 --> 01:11:05.877
When's that door comin' in?

01:11:05.909 --> 01:11:07.711
Uh, Wednesday they said.

01:11:11.349 --> 01:11:13.885
Sorry about that.

01:11:13.917 --> 01:11:16.755
Well, that's alright.

01:11:16.787 --> 01:11:21.225
You just call it
collateral damage there.

01:11:21.259 --> 01:11:23.295
Is that what Lem was?

01:11:26.029 --> 01:11:27.765
<i>Or was he always
part of the plan?</i>

01:11:31.069 --> 01:11:32.304
Huh?

01:11:32.337 --> 01:11:35.640
We're both soldiers.

01:11:35.672 --> 01:11:38.108
We've had death smile at us,

01:11:38.141 --> 01:11:39.911
and we smiled back.

01:11:42.646 --> 01:11:44.916
So stop pretending.

01:11:52.623 --> 01:11:56.293
I didn't recognize
it at first...

01:11:56.327 --> 01:11:58.096
but that brand on your cows...

01:12:00.898 --> 01:12:03.735
H-H...
Harvey Harrison.

01:12:03.768 --> 01:12:05.069
Your other egg in the basket.

01:12:12.676 --> 01:12:15.212
So?

01:12:15.246 --> 01:12:18.783
So, the ballistics showed that
the gun that was used

01:12:18.815 --> 01:12:22.653
to kill Lem was used in a murder
up in Philadelphia.

01:12:22.686 --> 01:12:24.055
Uh...

01:12:24.087 --> 01:12:27.224
Those robbers,
they were from Philly.

01:12:27.257 --> 01:12:28.859
Coincidence?
I don't think so.

01:12:30.293 --> 01:12:32.631
I think that that gun...

01:12:34.231 --> 01:12:37.335
is the same gun...

01:12:37.368 --> 01:12:39.170
that you got in your
hand right now.

01:12:45.143 --> 01:12:49.713
Justin look now...

01:12:49.747 --> 01:12:51.416
We have to do
what we have to do...

01:12:51.448 --> 01:12:55.119
to protect what we love.

01:12:55.153 --> 01:12:56.988
Is that justification?

01:12:57.020 --> 01:12:59.990
No.

01:13:00.024 --> 01:13:03.261
But to be honest, it's how
I've learned to sleep at night.

01:13:05.762 --> 01:13:08.867
I like you, Harvey...

01:13:08.899 --> 01:13:11.935
but if you pull that gun...

01:13:11.969 --> 01:13:14.239
I'm gonna have to kill you.

01:13:18.475 --> 01:13:21.746
Are you <i>that</i> fast?

01:13:21.779 --> 01:13:23.415
I'm as fast as I need to be.

01:13:30.087 --> 01:13:33.957
Nah, I like you too
Justin so it's

01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:34.426
just a terrible shame-

01:13:34.458 --> 01:13:37.362
<i>Stop!!!</i>

01:13:37.395 --> 01:13:38.463
Drop it.

01:13:38.496 --> 01:13:40.398
Put it down, Penny.

01:13:42.332 --> 01:13:45.436
Stop.

01:13:45.470 --> 01:13:46.971
It was both of us.

01:13:47.003 --> 01:13:48.840
Baby, please no!

01:13:48.872 --> 01:13:52.443
I killed Vivian.

01:13:52.476 --> 01:13:55.313
But I didn't mean to.

01:14:05.957 --> 01:14:06.891
<i>I asked if I could
talk to her.</i>

01:14:06.923 --> 01:14:09.293
You know, in private.

01:14:09.327 --> 01:14:11.396
Vivian.

01:14:11.429 --> 01:14:12.698
<i>So we stepped into the woods...</i>

01:14:14.899 --> 01:14:17.202
there wasn't anywhere
else to go.

01:14:17.234 --> 01:14:19.903
I need for you
to think about...

01:14:19.936 --> 01:14:22.407
<i>And I unloaded on her.</i>

01:14:22.439 --> 01:14:23.274
<i>We won't make it without
the cows, you see?</i>

01:14:25.909 --> 01:14:30.881
It's what keeps us afloat.

01:14:30.914 --> 01:14:35.019
But she just listened;
didn't say anything.

01:14:35.051 --> 01:14:39.423
Can't make it without the cows;
it's what keeps us afloat.

01:14:39.457 --> 01:14:41.292
<i>I told her about
our lease with her father.</i>

01:14:41.324 --> 01:14:43.827
And the lease that we signed
with your father...

01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:45.363
<i>She'd already made up her mind.</i>

01:14:45.395 --> 01:14:46.063
...does that not
mean anything to you?

01:14:46.096 --> 01:14:48.099
I'm sorry.

01:14:50.868 --> 01:14:52.470
That's not what bothered me.

01:14:55.439 --> 01:14:56.908
It was her <i>smile.</i>

01:15:00.011 --> 01:15:01.980
<i>Condescending
like we don't</i>

01:15:02.012 --> 01:15:04.983
try hard enough or...

01:15:05.015 --> 01:15:07.518
maybe we should find another
way to make money.

01:15:07.551 --> 01:15:09.353
How do you
sleep at night?

01:15:09.386 --> 01:15:10.287
<i>When she tried to leave...</i>

01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:11.488
I'm not finished!

01:15:11.521 --> 01:15:14.057
<i>I pushed her.</i>

01:15:14.091 --> 01:15:16.861
I wasn't done talkin'
so I pushed her.

01:15:16.894 --> 01:15:19.063
<i>But she had those red heels...</i>

01:15:19.095 --> 01:15:22.000
<i>...in the woods.</i>

01:15:22.033 --> 01:15:23.968
She tripped over a rock...

01:15:24.001 --> 01:15:25.904
<i>and hit her head.</i>

01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:30.108
<i>I knew she'd be
dead in a minute.</i>

01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:32.176
I could tell by
the way she hit.

01:15:32.210 --> 01:15:34.378
<i>I could see it in her eyes.</i>

01:15:40.417 --> 01:15:44.054
<i>When I told Harvey...</i>

01:15:44.087 --> 01:15:46.023
he said,
"We done stepped in it

01:15:46.056 --> 01:15:48.458
now and we gotta finish it...

01:15:52.462 --> 01:15:55.332
...it's our only chance."

01:15:55.365 --> 01:15:57.534
If-if we had killed
the husband,

01:15:57.568 --> 01:16:01.972
the land would have gone
back to Cliff and he would

01:16:02.006 --> 01:16:04.075
have honored our lease,
I know he would have.

01:16:04.108 --> 01:16:08.145
<i>And-and...
we would have had the cows</i>

01:16:08.179 --> 01:16:09.447
<i>on the Pierce's land
like we wanted.</i>

01:16:09.479 --> 01:16:13.851
And we've put all of our savings
into them cows.

01:16:23.127 --> 01:16:24.929
Oh!

01:16:43.613 --> 01:16:48.318
Nobody was supposed to
know because the deputy's

01:16:48.351 --> 01:16:51.221
got a gun that had slid up under
the shelf there.

01:16:51.255 --> 01:16:54.125
And I found it and
nobody was supposed to

01:16:54.158 --> 01:16:59.998
know and it was untraceable.

01:17:03.935 --> 01:17:06.671
I'm sorry.

01:17:09.372 --> 01:17:12.643
I'm sorry.

01:17:12.676 --> 01:17:15.078
Put down the gun.

01:17:17.213 --> 01:17:20.484
Nobody else has to die.

01:17:20.518 --> 01:17:23.221
<i>Put the gun down.</i>

01:17:27.692 --> 01:17:29.961
Nobody else has to die.

01:17:37.068 --> 01:17:39.470
<i>It's okay.</i>

01:17:45.643 --> 01:17:48.212
It's okay.

01:18:37.094 --> 01:18:40.398
You didn't ask me how
old my daughter was.

01:18:40.430 --> 01:18:42.332
She's 12.

01:18:45.136 --> 01:18:46.604
Thank you.

01:18:52.542 --> 01:18:54.378
Sheriff.

01:19:08.158 --> 01:19:11.295
Bye, baby.

01:19:46.729 --> 01:19:47.798
Good evening, sheriff.

01:19:47.832 --> 01:19:49.367
Want some dessert?

01:19:49.399 --> 01:19:51.101
No thanks,
I got a date.

01:19:51.135 --> 01:19:53.137
Date night?

01:19:54.572 --> 01:19:56.841
Nice!

01:20:00.778 --> 01:20:02.646
I'm all
cleaned up,

01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:06.650
and ready for my date.

01:20:06.684 --> 01:20:08.453
You know they treat you like
you're one of their own

01:20:08.485 --> 01:20:11.288
now that you've solved that
case.

01:20:11.322 --> 01:20:13.557
I'm the same guy they frowned at
when I got here.

01:20:13.591 --> 01:20:17.561
Well...

01:20:17.595 --> 01:20:19.730
you did good, Justin.

01:20:19.762 --> 01:20:22.265
Protect and serve.

01:20:22.298 --> 01:20:23.801
That's what they're
payin' me to do.

01:20:27.404 --> 01:20:30.308
Well, listen to you just
dropping your "g's"

01:20:30.341 --> 01:20:31.876
and becomin' all local.

01:20:31.908 --> 01:20:33.844
I reckon'!

01:20:38.815 --> 01:20:40.717
You know, Justin...

01:20:43.154 --> 01:20:46.724
I think I realized somethin'.

01:20:46.756 --> 01:20:50.727
It took me 10 years
to figure it out but...

01:20:50.761 --> 01:20:54.565
I finally understand why you
charge head first into danger.

01:20:58.502 --> 01:21:00.238
It's because if you won't do it,
nobody else will.

01:21:02.706 --> 01:21:05.309
I guess.

01:21:05.341 --> 01:21:07.878
It's admirable.

01:21:07.912 --> 01:21:10.213
It's important.

01:21:17.654 --> 01:21:20.557
<i>I'm ready!</i>

01:21:20.591 --> 01:21:23.194
You ready?

01:21:23.226 --> 01:21:24.528
The theater is two counties over
and I don't wanna miss previews.

01:21:24.561 --> 01:21:25.563
I'm ready!

01:21:25.595 --> 01:21:27.264
Bye, mom.

01:21:27.297 --> 01:21:28.398
Bye, just have her
back by 10.

01:21:28.431 --> 01:21:30.635
Okay.

01:21:35.271 --> 01:21:37.240
Well, come on!

01:22:45.643 --> 01:22:48.712
Dad, you're doing that
stare thing again.

01:22:48.746 --> 01:22:50.448
I'm just scanning.

01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:52.550
I'd start driving.

01:22:52.582 --> 01:22:53.483
We're gonna be late
for the movie... again.

01:22:57.020 --> 01:22:59.422
No more boxes... you unpacked!

01:22:59.456 --> 01:23:00.925
This is home.

01:23:08.666 --> 01:23:10.935
<i>So what is this
boy's name?</i>

01:23:10.967 --> 01:23:13.003
<i>Ah! You almost
got me there, you know?</i>

01:23:13.037 --> 01:23:16.440
<i>Yeah, not a chance,
Dad.</i>

01:23:16.472 --> 01:23:19.310
<i>A mystery, huh?</i>

01:23:19.342 --> 01:23:21.878
<i>I like a good mystery!</i>
