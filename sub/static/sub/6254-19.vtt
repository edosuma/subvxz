A neighbor spotted smoke
about 7:00 am.

But it was a cold morning,
so he thought it was
just the fireplace.

he saw flames,

was out by 10:00 am.

the victim is female.

Something in here
must have been valuable.
Workshop materials mostly.

High explosives, bullet casings—

the pistol she was holding.

— She was decapitated

— Decapitation might
have played a part.

factor in.

two other psychologists...

like the same amount.

is not quantifiable.

06:04.031 --> 06:07.364

are unreliable.

too burned to be saved.

are dark to light gray,

06:20.214 --> 06:21.829

06:47.825 --> 06:48.814

06:50.661 --> 06:54.153

06:54.248 --> 06:57.490

belong to the same person.

just mostly certain.

You can’t be mostly certain.

From the angle
of the entry wound,

07:08.429 --> 07:13.139

most likely transected

was separated from her body.

Um, three.
Three, exactly.
It never happens.

revealed a mixture of
phosphorus and magnesium,

09:19.727 --> 09:24.346
an explosive used
in a certain kind of shell
called dragon’s breath.

09:24.481 --> 09:26.472
When fired, it produces
a 50—foot flame—
[ Clacking ]

09:26.567 --> 09:29.274
that lasts
for about three seconds.

09:29.361 --> 09:32.478
That would mean that the same
shot that killed the victim
also started the fire.

09:32.573 --> 09:36.282
Yeah, if it works,
which is what we are
here to find out.

09:36.368 --> 09:40.031

a little more sensitive
than I thought.

10:13.489 --> 10:15.275
We went through
basic training together.

10:15.365 --> 10:19.404
She was a real soldier.
Deanna was the real deal.

10:19.495 --> 10:23.363
- Right, so what happened?
— She started talking about
the end of the world.

10:27.169 --> 10:29.376
She took
a swing at me.
So you laid her out.

10:29.463 --> 10:31.044
And then we both
got discharged.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.747
Deanna was pretty sure
that our whole society...

10:33.842 --> 10:35.958
was going to fall apart,
including the military.

10:36.094 --> 10:38.801
But you don’t believe that
society then will fall apart?
Nope.

10:38.889 --> 10:42.097
People are resilient.
We’re gonna be okay.

10:42.184 --> 10:44.300

showing that you called her...

10:44.394 --> 10:46.055
eight times
in the last few months.

10:46.146 --> 10:49.013
Because I didn’t know
where she lived anymore.

10:49.107 --> 10:50.938
She disappeared.
Fell right off the grid.

for someone who ruined
your career in the military.

I’d like to point out
that if you called her
eight times,

Thank you.

11:41.577 --> 11:43.568
[ Device Beeps ]

11:45.831 --> 11:49.699
You found something,
Ms. Wick?
I did. Look at this.

11:49.793 --> 11:54.332
When I was cleaning the femur,
I found a remodeled injury,
less than a year old.

11:54.423 --> 11:56.414
Very good work,
Ms. Wick.

11:56.508 --> 11:59.671
This is a nasty injury.
Expertly set.

11:59.803 --> 12:03.466
But the cause—
It’s not familiar to me.
I thought you might have a theory.

12:03.557 --> 12:05.422
l have seen breaks
like this before.

12:05.517 --> 12:08.429
The remodeled splintering
indicates that she was hit...

12:08.520 --> 12:11.011
with something
of a relatively high density...

12:11.106 --> 12:13.347
— at a relatively high speed.
- A bullet?

12:13.442 --> 12:15.899
More dense
and slower than a bullet.

12:15.986 --> 12:18.147
A baseball bat.
A car bumper.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.695
Faster than both
and more localized.

12:23.869 --> 12:28.613
Remodeling shows striations
from the splintering.

12:28.707 --> 12:30.197
The Civil War.

12:31.418 --> 12:35.002
Hobbyists still use
Civil War munitions.
Oh!

12:36.590 --> 12:38.751
A musket ball.
Larger.

12:38.842 --> 12:41.458
I believe we’re looking at
an injury from a cannonball.

12:42.846 --> 12:46.680
We have the medical records
from the Veterans Administration.

12:46.767 --> 12:48.348
There’s no mention of a wound.

12:48.435 --> 12:51.222
How does someone
who lives off the grid
get shot by a cannon...

12:51.313 --> 12:53.349
and get medical attention
this good?

13:03.700 --> 13:06.316
[ Hodgins ]
I took samples of
the victim’s remodeled femur.

13:06.411 --> 13:08.948
The injury contained
cast iron and lead.

13:09.039 --> 13:10.620
[ Daisy]
Who makes
her own cannonballs?

13:10.707 --> 13:14.291
Well, she had
this old Civil War
cannonball press,

13:14.378 --> 13:16.334
which requires
cast iron and lead—

13:16.421 --> 13:20.164
no brass, copper or steel
that would be used today—
so she did.

13:20.258 --> 13:22.590
So she shot herself
in the leg with a cannon?

13:22.678 --> 13:25.920
Are you thinking some
terribly complicated
suicide attempt?

13:26.014 --> 13:28.847
I’m thinking accident,
but I like your flair
for the dramatic.

13:28.934 --> 13:34.270
I’ll be testing my theory later
when | find a matching cannon
from the Civil War exhibit.

13:34.356 --> 13:37.723
You won’t have to.
l matched the wound
on the victim’s femur.

13:37.818 --> 13:39.979
You said the diameter
of a two—pounder cannonball...

13:40.112 --> 13:42.569
was 6.8 centimeters,
right?
Yeah.

13:44.241 --> 13:47.904
Guess you heard that Sweets
is finally moving out
of Mom and Dad’s house.

13:47.995 --> 13:50.236
You misjudge Lance.
He’s not a child.

13:50.330 --> 13:53.367
He’s responsible
for managing pro bono
psychological counseling...

13:53.458 --> 13:55.244
at the homeless shelter
in Penn Quarter,

13:55.335 --> 13:57.997
and he helped me make
investments in my 401 (k)
that withstood the crash.

13:58.088 --> 14:00.204
So his only problem
is sleeping alone?

14:00.298 --> 14:03.711
Nobody likes that, Dr. Hodgins.
Isn’t that why you married
Ms. Montenegro?

14:03.802 --> 14:05.588
[ Chuckles ]
Ooh, snap.

14:05.679 --> 14:08.136
Okay, the diameter
of the ball...

14:08.223 --> 14:10.464
matches the outline
of the break on her leg...

14:10.559 --> 14:13.392
as well as the directionality
of the splintering.

14:13.478 --> 14:15.093
Very impressive,
Ms. Montenegro.

14:15.230 --> 14:17.346
Thanks, Daisy.
Well, l-l’d like
to be sure.

14:17.441 --> 14:21.104
We should definitely check velocity
as well as density of the ball—

14:21.194 --> 14:22.980
I know what this is about.
You just want to—

14:23.071 --> 14:25.153
Yes, | just
want to be thorough.

14:25.240 --> 14:27.026
So if you need me,

14:27.117 --> 14:29.324
I’ll be next door
in the Antietam exhibit.

14:34.166 --> 14:35.781
- A cannonball?
— Yeah, that’s what they think.

14:35.876 --> 14:38.083
It’s all very old school, you know?
She makes her own ammo.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.202
But a cannon?
Yeah, a cannon.

14:40.297 --> 14:44.040
She— She’s probably making, you know,
ammo for other people as well.

14:44.134 --> 14:46.671
So if we find out
who those people are,
we might find our killer.

14:46.762 --> 14:49.504
lt’s the only lead that we have.
Plus the test on
Carlene Blayney’s shotgun—

14:49.639 --> 14:51.254
that came back
negative as well.

Yes! Thank you.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.637

Great. Thanks. Bye.

Sorry.
Ah, it’s okay.

You need any help?

15:09.367 --> 15:12.154
No, but thanks.
All right.

that building out
for asbestos...

15:14.331 --> 15:16.913

cracks in the foundation—
Yeah.

15:17.042 --> 15:18.828

Yeah. All done.

Hey, we have
a lot in common,

15:27.594 --> 15:29.710
plus we have the skills
to work out our disagreements...

15:29.805 --> 15:31.261
in a healthy and constructive manner.

15:31.348 --> 15:33.430
But I’m gonna miss you too,
Agent Booth.

15:33.517 --> 15:38.477
Right. Yeah. Well, | see you
all the time here at work.
Plus, | get my tub back,

15:38.563 --> 15:41.054
and I won’t have to look at
that stupid pomegranate juice
in my refrigerator.

15:41.191 --> 15:43.352
You still haven’t
tried it yet?
No, I haven’t, okay?

15:43.443 --> 15:45.604
— That’s called “shrinkjuice.”
— It’s just pomegranate juice.

15:45.737 --> 15:49.355
Why don’t you gather all your
new neighbors together, and you
can have a shrinkjuice party?

15:49.491 --> 15:52.198
It’s good.
Yeah, sure.
Enjoy that!

15:54.996 --> 15:57.408
There’s pitting
in the mandible and maxilla.

15:57.499 --> 15:59.706
I assumed
it was from buckshot
when she was killed,

15:59.793 --> 16:02.034
but the damage is too small
and not deep enough.

16:02.129 --> 16:05.963
Mmm. Dr. Hodgins said
there was no buckshot
in the shell.

16:06.049 --> 16:07.835
We already know
she was making
cannonballs.

16:07.926 --> 16:10.133
Maybe there’s another
form of ammunition
we’re overlooking?

16:10.220 --> 16:15.385
Look again, Ms. Wick.
This pitting was not caused
by external forces.

16:15.517 --> 16:20.056
Caries sicca.
Caused by the gummatous
lesions of syphilis.

16:20.147 --> 16:23.105
- Syphilis?
- The victim was in the latent
stage of the disease.

16:23.191 --> 16:27.480
- I should have caught that.
— The disease is not as common
as it once was, fortunately.

16:27.571 --> 16:29.937
— Safe sex, yes.
— l was thinking of penicillin.

16:30.031 --> 16:34.650
I clearly have less faith
in the sexual restraint
of the masses than you do.

16:34.744 --> 16:37.907
There was no mention of syphilis
on the victim’s medical records.

16:37.998 --> 16:39.488
She may not have known
she had it.

16:39.583 --> 16:43.451
That disease
can lie dormant for years
before any symptoms appear.

16:43.545 --> 16:45.456
This could explain
the victim’s hostility.

16:45.589 --> 16:49.878
Her tissue samples showed
benzodiazepine in her system.
She’d taken a sedative?

16:49.968 --> 16:52.755
There was no mention
of her being on
any prescribed medication.

16:52.846 --> 16:54.882
She wouldn’t be the first one
to take drugs illegally.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.759
[Angela ]
Hodgins said the cannonballs
were made with lead,

17:00.854 --> 17:03.186
so I did a search
for anyone near
the victim...

17:03.273 --> 17:06.606
who was buying up
large quantities of lead
from salvage yards.

17:07.777 --> 17:09.358
Dr. Fred Dumaski.

17:09.446 --> 17:11.027
Yeah, it’s a family practitioner.

17:11.114 --> 17:13.651
Who gave up his practice.

17:13.742 --> 17:16.358
Maybe he was done
with the whole
“do no harm” thing.

17:16.453 --> 17:18.569
[Angela ]
This is not necessary, Hodgins.

17:18.663 --> 17:20.494
I already double—checked
the figures.

17:20.582 --> 17:22.538
A cannonball fractured
our victim’s leg.

17:22.626 --> 17:24.708
And I am not doubting that,
Angie.

17:24.794 --> 17:26.876
Then why exactly
are you doing this?

17:26.963 --> 17:29.921
Have we all forgot the concept
of the double—blind study?

17:30.008 --> 17:34.377
— Doesn’t apply to artillery.
- Theories are improved
as more evidence is gathered,

17:34.471 --> 17:37.087
so that accuracy in prediction
improves over time.

17:37.182 --> 17:40.424
For that, we need independent
strands of evidence, rather than
a single foundational source.

17:40.518 --> 17:42.099
And you cannot argue with that.

17:42.187 --> 17:43.643
So, he’s never shot a cannon.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.472
Excuse me for loving my work.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.522
Goggles and ear protection,
please.

17:50.028 --> 17:52.314
— I made the cannonball myself.
— Very impressive.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.612
Replicated it exactly.
They used a lot of lead.

17:54.699 --> 17:57.281
— Already on it.
— Right. Okay.

17:57.369 --> 17:58.859
Ready?

18:00.163 --> 18:02.154
Okay, everyone, stand back!

18:04.292 --> 18:06.704
Fire in the hole!

18:21.309 --> 18:23.300
Whoa!

18:27.649 --> 18:30.231
So, velocity is—

18:30.318 --> 18:31.979
[With Hodgins]
1,400 feet per second.

18:32.070 --> 18:34.231
...per... second.

18:34.322 --> 18:35.402
Okay, right.

18:35.490 --> 18:39.403
Now, range at five degrees
would be—

18:39.494 --> 18:41.200
— 1,600 yards.
- ...yards.

18:41.288 --> 18:43.620
Okay, good. So then,
we have corroboration,

18:43.707 --> 18:45.447
which is exactly
what we want as scientists.

18:45.542 --> 18:47.248
Of course.
Now clean up this mess.

18:47.335 --> 18:48.450
— One more?
— No.

18:48.545 --> 18:49.625
— It’s all setup.
— No.

18:49.754 --> 18:51.255

cannonbau
No.

There are complex psychological factors
that go into a person’s life choices.

- To dismiss it with an easy
moniker like that—
- Really?

19:51.107 --> 19:53.314
In this case,
I’m fine with “wack jobs.”
Complete wack job.

19:53.401 --> 19:55.141
Is there any evidence
that he knew Deanna Barbieri?

19:55.236 --> 19:58.603
Well, being a survivalist explains
why she was living in a shed.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.906
These people, these wack jobs—
They’re a tight—knit community.

20:01.993 --> 20:04.405
They’re fiercely defensive,
and they’re suspicious
of the government.

20:04.496 --> 20:07.829
I— It won’t be easy
to get Dr. Apocalypse to talk.

20:07.916 --> 20:10.703
Well, a neighbor says that
he hasn’t been back to his place
since Deanna died.

20:10.835 --> 20:13.668
That should be enough
to get a warrant.
Oh, it was, yeah.

20:13.755 --> 20:17.873
We searched his house and found out
that he bought land last October.

20:17.967 --> 20:20.800
Ten acres of nothing
in Wise County, Virginia.

20:22.972 --> 20:25.964
He spent half a million dollars
on 10 acres of nothing?

20:26.059 --> 20:27.890
The land itself only
cost $50,000,

20:27.977 --> 20:31.686

went to a company
called Safe Harbors.

in survival bunkers.

- l’m Dr. Apocalypse!
— On your knees!

22:36.064 --> 22:38.055
I can explain everything!

22:39.901 --> 22:42.062
I can explain everything.
[Agent #2 ]
Get down!

22:48.034 --> 22:49.615
[Man Coughing]

22:54.958 --> 22:58.576
I met Deanna online. I could
tell right away that she’d be
a huge asset to the group.

22:58.711 --> 23:02.044
[ Booth ]
You mean weaponry?
Weapons, defensive tactics,

23:02.131 --> 23:04.713
ammunition, her military training.

23:04.801 --> 23:06.337
But also just her character.

23:06.469 --> 23:09.336
Okay, when you say “our group”?
We’re preppers,
Agent Booth.

23:09.430 --> 23:11.842
We’re ready for
the impending collapse of society.

23:11.933 --> 23:13.889
What’s gonna cause
the collapse of society?

23:13.977 --> 23:17.890
The economy, race wars,
ecological disasters,
global climate change,

23:17.981 --> 23:20.347
terrorist attack, viral pandemic—
take your pick.

23:20.441 --> 23:22.272
— lt’s inevitable.
— Right, okay.

23:22.360 --> 23:24.191
How did Deanna
break her leg?

23:24.279 --> 23:27.612
I’m guessing that showed up
in her autopsy report.

23:27.699 --> 23:30.566
It’s odd that there’s no mention
of it in her medical records.

23:30.660 --> 23:34.528
It was an accident.
I was practicing loading
the cannon, and it went off.

23:34.622 --> 23:37.910
Deanna and I saw it
as a perfect opportunity...

23:38.001 --> 23:41.789
to show that we could be self—sufficient
in terms of trauma care.

23:41.879 --> 23:43.961
Her accident actually
pulled our group together.

23:44.048 --> 23:46.334
What were you hiding from
when we found you?

23:46.426 --> 23:49.589
Nothing. It was a practice drill.
We knew we were
going in for a week.

23:49.679 --> 23:51.169
What happened to your arm?

23:54.183 --> 23:55.468
Ouch.

23:55.560 --> 23:58.222
- I gave myself a shot.
- Trauma care.

23:58.354 --> 24:00.185
[ Sweets ]
For what?
Venereal disease.

24:01.608 --> 24:03.644
Our victim had syphilis.
You have a venereal disease.

24:03.735 --> 24:06.067
Self—treated. Maybe you can get away
without your wife finding out.

24:06.195 --> 24:11.235
The world as you know it is
about to end. Delores knew
everything about me and Deanna.

24:11.326 --> 24:12.782
It’s a new world.

24:12.869 --> 24:14.780
Not yet, Dr. Apocalypse, all right?

24:14.871 --> 24:17.658
You’re still practicing, okay?
This is still the same old world.

24:22.962 --> 24:25.419
[Hodgins]
I got this list of items
in the bunker from the FBI.

24:25.506 --> 24:27.633
Well, the preppers
were very well equipped.

24:27.717 --> 24:31.881
I suspect they
could’ve survived down there
for months quite successfully.

24:31.971 --> 24:34.963
Thank God I am a conspiracy theorist
and not a doomsday hysteric.

24:35.058 --> 24:39.142
Well, it’s not hysteria.
In the long run, human beings
are scheduled for extinction.

24:39.228 --> 24:42.470
Yeah, when the sun
expands into a red giant
in three billion years.

24:42.607 --> 24:46.600
Not necessarily. We already have
enough weapons to annihilate
all life on the planet.

24:46.694 --> 24:50.437
You have tremendous faith
in a violent species
such as ours...

24:50.531 --> 24:52.817
to think that we will
have the self—control
not to use them.

24:52.909 --> 24:55.070
Man, I came to you
with good news.
Now I’m just depressed.

24:55.203 --> 24:59.071
I want good news.
Well, phosphorus and magnesium
were on the FBI. list.

24:59.207 --> 25:01.698
So?
So I found both of them
on the victim.

25:01.793 --> 25:03.829
And they were the source
of the fire.

25:03.920 --> 25:06.707
Which means one of the preppers
is probably the killer.

25:10.301 --> 25:14.260
Delores Dumaski,
Mrs. Apocalypse.
The one he cheated on.

25:14.347 --> 25:18.386
Yeah, she specializes in nutrition,
food prep and storage.

25:18.476 --> 25:22.389
Now, Dennis Bukovac
is a retired minister.

25:22.480 --> 25:25.938
He’s in charge of the group’s
emotional and spiritual health.

25:26.067 --> 25:28.979
Right. I wonder what the minister
thinks of free sex.
Right.

25:29.070 --> 25:30.560
Milo Mills, 28.

25:30.655 --> 25:32.361
He’s got a degree
in mechanical engineering.

25:32.448 --> 25:36.032
- The one who fixes everything.
— Yeah. Generators, ventilation, lighting.

25:36.119 --> 25:37.780
Maybe he worked weapons
with the victim.

25:38.996 --> 25:40.577
Any of these people
crazy enough to kill?

25:40.665 --> 25:42.451
Wack jobs— all of ’em.

25:43.626 --> 25:44.661
Yeah.

25:48.131 --> 25:51.339
[Angela ]
So I was able to identify a few
of the objects from the fire.

25:51.426 --> 25:52.882
Awesome, Angie.

25:52.969 --> 25:55.961
You literally recovered
evidence from the ashes.

25:56.055 --> 25:58.967
So this pile of debris here
is a cot.

25:59.058 --> 26:02.095
— Okay. What’s that lump there?
— That is a screwdriver.

26:02.186 --> 26:04.643
This is like a treasure hunt.
What’s that?

26:04.731 --> 26:07.017
— That used to be a tool box.
- Okay.

26:07.108 --> 26:09.440
I recognize this.
This is a shell casing.

26:09.569 --> 26:12.402
But what’s that?
It’s a jar of nails.

26:12.488 --> 26:14.649
Now, under this plate here,

26:14.741 --> 26:18.484
there’s this singed paper,
which I think is a letter.

26:18.578 --> 26:22.070
I’m gonna try to get it from
evidence and see if we can
figure out what it is.

26:24.917 --> 26:29.035
Hey, are you listening to your lovely
and very clever wife over here?

26:29.130 --> 26:32.122
Yeah. No, sorry.
It’s just this—this screwdriver...

26:32.216 --> 26:37.586
would’ve been made out of
beryllium, which has a melting
point of 865 degrees Celsius.

26:37.722 --> 26:39.713
Okay.
But...

26:39.807 --> 26:42.594
the shell casing
is made of yellow brass.

26:42.685 --> 26:44.141
Well, why didn’t it melt?

26:44.228 --> 26:48.141
Yellow brass has a melting point
of 905 degrees Celsius.

26:48.232 --> 26:52.646
So the temperature
was greater than
865 degrees...

26:52.737 --> 26:55.945
but less than
905 degrees.

26:56.032 --> 26:57.488
So... what?

26:57.575 --> 26:59.736
Angie, at these temperatures,
a human body would’ve been...

26:59.827 --> 27:02.569
completely reduced to ash
in three hours.

27:02.663 --> 27:05.279
So either the temperature
of the fire wasn’t that hot...

27:05.374 --> 27:07.751
or it burned for a much
shorter period of time.

27:07.835 --> 27:09.746
Yeah,
about half the time.

27:09.837 --> 27:12.374
l’m not gonna be insulted
if you run a simulation
and check my math—

27:12.465 --> 27:15.582
Oh, I will.
But if you’re right,

27:15.676 --> 27:19.840
then the fire started
somewhere closer to 8:30
and not 7:00.

27:19.931 --> 27:21.296
Yeah.

27:21.390 --> 27:25.053
Meaning no one in that
bunker could’ve murdered
Deanna Barbieri.

27:29.732 --> 27:32.519
So you’re absolutely sure
that nobody in that bunker...

27:32.610 --> 27:34.316
could’ve killed Deanna Barbieri?

27:34.403 --> 27:37.315
Why do you keep asking me
to qualify my conclusions?

27:37.406 --> 27:39.943
You know that l,
as well as the others
on my team, are brilliant.

27:40.034 --> 27:43.868
It’s just that survivalists
are a close—knit group.
They’re like the military.

27:43.955 --> 27:46.241
Deanna was outspoken.
She challenged authority.

27:46.332 --> 27:49.665
Somebody like that would
challenge the very essence
of the group dynamic.

27:49.752 --> 27:52.664
And killing her would be
a logical extension
of the needs of the group.

27:52.755 --> 27:56.293
— Yes.
— It doesn’t seem to be
anyone from that group.

27:56.384 --> 27:58.841
But Deanna lived off the grid.

27:58.928 --> 28:00.839
Even Carlene Blayney
didn’t know how to find her.

28:00.930 --> 28:03.797
She wasn’t in contact
with anyone except that group.

28:03.891 --> 28:07.509
I’m sorry, Lance.
You’re gonna have to come up
with another theory.

28:07.603 --> 28:10.845
The condition of the burned
bones combined with
the temperature of the fire...

28:10.940 --> 28:14.603
tells us that the body
burned for a maximum
of 90 minutes.

28:14.694 --> 28:16.480
Okay, well, that proves...

28:16.571 --> 28:19.734
that Deanna was killed
at around 8:30 am, not 7:00.

28:19.824 --> 28:23.191
But all the preppers
were already locked
in the bunker by then.

28:23.286 --> 28:24.776
You’re wonderful, Lance.

28:26.330 --> 28:27.319
Excuse me?

28:28.791 --> 28:33.660
You’re so... thoughtful
and committed to the truth.

28:33.754 --> 28:35.585
It’s a rare quality.

28:35.673 --> 28:37.959
Even in the way
you approached
getting your own place.

28:39.760 --> 28:42.251
— Okay. Okay, I get it.
- What?

28:42.346 --> 28:45.884
You think that l was acting
like a child by living
with Booth and Dr. Brennan.

28:45.975 --> 28:47.636
Not at all.

28:47.727 --> 28:52.391
I thought it showed
great maturity and strength.

28:52.481 --> 28:54.392
Everyone was gonna judge you
for being weak,

28:54.483 --> 28:58.317
but you knew that you needed
time and a safe place
to collect yourself,

28:58.404 --> 29:00.736
reflect on
what happened.

29:00.823 --> 29:03.189
Where better to do that
than with people
who love you?

29:04.535 --> 29:08.995
Any person who can’t accept
that— that’s the weak person.

29:12.835 --> 29:15.952
I think you’re pretty
wonderful yourself, Daisy.

29:16.672 --> 29:18.663
I know.

29:18.758 --> 29:21.215
Makes no sense
that we couldn’t
make a go of it.

29:22.011 --> 29:23.501
None.

29:25.222 --> 29:27.508
Maybe somebody tampered
with the time lock.

29:27.600 --> 29:29.431
Hodgins says
that’s impossible.

29:29.518 --> 29:33.852
Any tampering with mechanisms
sets off an alarm and makes it
impossible to reset the lock.

29:33.940 --> 29:35.771
- It was locked
when they arrived.
— [ Groans ]

29:35.858 --> 29:38.895
Well, there’s gotta be some other way
in and out of that bunker.

29:38.986 --> 29:42.820
The killer could’ve snuck out,
killed Deanna, snuck back in.

29:42.907 --> 29:45.944
You know what?
Agent Booth needs
to reexamine that bunker.

29:46.035 --> 29:47.525
Ooh, my, another mark.

29:47.620 --> 29:49.110
Oh, wait.

29:55.378 --> 29:59.587
Daisy just found this
on Deanna Barbieri’s clavicle.

29:59.674 --> 30:04.589
At first, she thought it was
just more pitting from
the victim’s venereal disease.

30:04.679 --> 30:06.795
It appears to be
some kind of puncture wound.

30:06.931 --> 30:12.096
From the angle, one might posit
that she was stabbed from behind
with a sharp pointed object.

30:12.186 --> 30:14.472
I think it’s a syringe
of some kind.

30:14.563 --> 30:17.691
Well, that would explain
how the drugs got into her system.

30:17.775 --> 30:21.768
But the puncture— I don’t recognize
that gauge needle. It’s very large.

30:21.862 --> 30:25.525
Hodgins is swabbing the clavicle
to see if he can determine
what the metal was.

30:25.616 --> 30:28.779
Injected with benzodiazepine.

30:28.869 --> 30:30.996
Clearly someone didn’t
want Deanna to make it
to the bunker that day.

30:31.080 --> 30:33.822
Or any day.

30:33.916 --> 30:38.000
I got the plans for the bunker
from Safe Harbors,
the company that built it.

30:38.087 --> 30:41.170
Oh, good, that should indicate
an escape hatch that would
override the time lock.

30:41.257 --> 30:44.670
Yeah, you’d think so,
but they said the emergency
routes and hatches...

30:44.760 --> 30:48.469
were proprietary designs
and giving them out would
compromise security.

30:48.556 --> 30:51.514
There’s gotta be some kind
of exit in case of a fire
or other disaster.

30:51.600 --> 30:53.932
I mean, surviving
is kind of the point
of the bunker.

30:54.020 --> 30:57.808
Yeah, well, that’s why I’m
doing a structural analysis
of the plans.

30:57.898 --> 31:00.605
I made a model of the bunker,
which we can walk though.

31:00.693 --> 31:03.230
Wow!
Very cool, Angie.

31:03.320 --> 31:07.233
Hey, did they provide you with
a list of materials used to, uh,
construct this bunker?

31:07.324 --> 31:08.860
Yeah, it’s over there.

31:08.951 --> 31:12.284
Most of the casing
is reinforced category 1 steel,

31:12.371 --> 31:14.657
manufactured
for pressure lines in ships.

31:14.749 --> 31:16.865
Well, the bunker was buried,
so they’d need the strongest.

31:16.959 --> 31:18.995
That means all the riveting
would be the same.

31:19.086 --> 31:21.418
There are tempered rivets
listed here in the supplies...

31:21.505 --> 31:23.211
that wouldn’t be used
with that grade of steel.

31:23.299 --> 31:27.212
Which means there’s
a section of the frame
which isn’t category 1.

31:27.303 --> 31:31.342
Yeah. If we can find it, we can find
the escape hatch the killer used...

31:31.432 --> 31:34.515
to sneak out and then sneak back in
after killing Deanna.

31:36.854 --> 31:41.063
I figured out why we’d never
used a syringe like this before.

31:43.402 --> 31:45.108
[ Brennan ]
Twelve—gauge syringe?

31:45.196 --> 31:48.563
They’re used by vets.
On farm animals, large dogs.

31:48.657 --> 31:52.320
Well, Dr. Apocalypse’s preppers
raise animals for food.

31:52.411 --> 31:56.154
Yes, and l reanalyzed
the benzodiazepine.
It’s not medical grade.

31:56.248 --> 31:59.365
— Did they make it themselves?
— Probably.
It was loaded with impurities.

31:59.460 --> 32:00.791
Wait. No, look.

32:00.878 --> 32:05.042
This is a log of all the items
the FBI. took from the bunker.

32:06.675 --> 32:08.131
Benzodiazepine.

32:08.219 --> 32:10.676
The standards are relaxed
for veterinary use.

32:10.763 --> 32:12.378
That’s why it’s impure.

32:12.473 --> 32:15.590
That explains why Dr. Apocalypse’s arm
was so swollen.

32:15.684 --> 32:18.141
Well— And whoever
had access to this...

32:18.229 --> 32:21.221
loaded that syringe
with a lot of benzodiazepine.

32:21.315 --> 32:23.021
They wanted to make sure
Deanna was knocked out.

32:23.109 --> 32:26.397
So it had to be
one of the preppers.

32:26.487 --> 32:28.728
[Angela ]
So this section of
ceiling paneling—

32:28.823 --> 32:31.109
lt’s reinforced, which means
the metal is lighter.

32:31.200 --> 32:33.361
So this is where
they put the hatch.

32:33.452 --> 32:35.909
[ Chuckles ]
Hey. You made me.

32:36.038 --> 32:38.324
Yeah, who—who better
to solve the riddle?
[ Chuckles ]

32:38.415 --> 32:41.999
So, you just have to
remove the paneling,
open the hatch and crawl out.

32:42.086 --> 32:44.452
- All right, hold on. Not so fast.
- What? You crawled out.

32:44.547 --> 32:46.287
— But how do | get back in?
— The same way.

32:46.382 --> 32:48.293
No, no.
See, the bunker—

32:48.384 --> 32:50.124
It was—
It was covered in soil.

32:50.219 --> 32:52.710
Six feet of soil,
untouched.

32:52.805 --> 32:55.888
Right. The soil would
fall in when the hatch
was opened.

32:55.975 --> 32:58.933
Yeah. Which is exactly
what’s supposed to happen
in an emergency,

32:59.019 --> 33:01.761
but it would take heavy
construction equipment
to cover it up again.

33:01.856 --> 33:05.440
Right. So the killer
couldn’t have gotten
in and out that way.

33:05.526 --> 33:09.644
Hey, you found the hatch.
I mean, that’s impressive enough.

33:09.738 --> 33:11.444
[ Beep/ng /

33:13.325 --> 33:15.782
- Hey. Booth. What’s up?
— Is that bug boy?

33:15.870 --> 33:17.326
Exactly the person
I was looking for.

33:17.413 --> 33:19.779
— Do you still have all
the evidence from the shed?
- Yeah, why?

33:19.874 --> 33:22.707
Because I think I know
how Deanna was killed.

33:27.506 --> 33:30.498
I cannot believe you are here.
You hate the lab.

33:30.593 --> 33:33.209
Right. So, uh, let’s make
this snappy, okay?

33:33.304 --> 33:37.343
Check these things out here.
Take a look at this, huh?

33:37.474 --> 33:40.807
What do you think?
I don’t— I don’t know
what you’re doing.

33:40.895 --> 33:42.977
You’re supposed to be
the genius. Come on.
Look at it.

33:43.063 --> 33:48.524
lt’s— It’s a latch,
a spring—loaded hinge,
a nail and a piece of pipe.

33:48.611 --> 33:50.101
It’s a booby trap.

33:50.237 --> 33:52.193
It’s a booby trap.
It’s a booby trap!

33:52.281 --> 33:55.899
Of course!
Oh, hey, we make a good team.

33:55.993 --> 33:58.109
Well, I sort of
thought of this
all on my own.

33:58.204 --> 33:59.865
Still, if you ever need
anyone in the field—

33:59.955 --> 34:02.116
[ Chuckles ]
That’s never gonna happen.
So, uh,

34:02.208 --> 34:04.244
whoever killed Deanna made sure
to give themselves an alibi.

34:04.335 --> 34:07.543
So they drug her,
set up a booby trap,

34:07.630 --> 34:10.212
then took off,
locked themselves
in the bunker,

34:10.299 --> 34:12.039
knowing she’d get killed
when she opened the door.

34:12.176 --> 34:13.962
It’s definitely
one of the preppers.
Hey, wait! Whoa!

34:14.094 --> 34:16.176
Where are you going?
We gotta prove this works.
It works.

34:16.263 --> 34:19.471
Yeah— Is your say—so
good enough for a court?

34:19.558 --> 34:21.765
We have to prove it works.

34:24.021 --> 34:26.307
- [ Hinge Squeaks]
— You’re gonna need a trigger.

34:26.398 --> 34:29.140
Well, that is what
the door is for,

34:29.235 --> 34:31.772
since that’s what was used
in the shed.

34:31.862 --> 34:33.602
Now, who wants the honor
of opening the door?

34:33.697 --> 34:35.312
[ Scoffs ]
Be incinerated?
No, thank you.

34:35.407 --> 34:38.444
I’ll do it. I replaced
the dragon’s breath shell...

34:38.535 --> 34:41.777
with a gelatin load fired
by CO2, so it’s completely safe.

34:41.872 --> 34:44.784
Well, it’s your experiment, okay?
You’re the one who’s gonna get shot.

34:44.875 --> 34:46.786
Uh, Agent Booth,
I wouldn’t stand right there.

34:46.877 --> 34:49.664
Don’t worry about it, bug boy, okay?
I’m just checking the trajec—

34:56.679 --> 34:58.044

34:58.138 --> 35:02.051
Hey, I, uh, thought
you didn’t like the lab.

35:02.142 --> 35:06.101
Well, ljust—
I came to see
how everything was going.

35:06.188 --> 35:07.974
- I’m good.
— Clearly.

35:08.065 --> 35:10.477
— We’re fine.
— Mm—hmm. Okay.

35:13.529 --> 35:15.019
I think we have
enough proof now.

35:15.114 --> 35:17.947
You know what?
You say anything,
I will stab you with my pen.

35:18.033 --> 35:20.490
[ Coughs, Chuckles Softly]

35:27.293 --> 35:29.204
So you would have the skill...

35:29.295 --> 35:31.536
to design a booby trap
like this?

35:34.383 --> 35:36.248
Most definitely.

35:36.385 --> 35:39.001
So would Deanna.
Well, she’s dead,
so that leaves you.

35:39.138 --> 35:42.175
Number three
would be Delores.
The food prepper girl? Why?

35:42.266 --> 35:45.633
We all teamed up
to train someone to take over
if we’re incapacitated.

35:45.728 --> 35:48.936
Delores taught me
about animal husbandry.
I taught her about engineering.

35:49.023 --> 35:51.935
Animal husbandry?
That’s why there were
vet needles and drugs.

35:52.026 --> 35:56.360
Yes. She kept animals healthy
so that when we ate them,
we wouldn’t get sick.

35:56.447 --> 35:59.189
So you taught her
how to make booby traps,
and in return,

35:59.283 --> 36:02.275
she taught you how
to administer drugs to animals.

36:02.411 --> 36:07.075
It’s gotta be one of you.
| see your predicament.

36:07.207 --> 36:10.199
You should choose Delores.
Why? Because Deanna slept
with her husband?

36:10.336 --> 36:15.626
— Because I didn’t do it.
— You have to give me something
more than just your statement.

36:15.758 --> 36:17.248
Give me a minute
to think.
Okay.

36:26.602 --> 36:31.141
You know, part of the whole
prepper practice is
you can’t wash as much...

36:31.273 --> 36:33.605
because of
the water shortages.
Okay.

36:33.692 --> 36:37.685
Delores is the only one
that doesn’t have to
practice for that.

36:37.780 --> 36:41.864
- She lives it.
— So she’s a dirty girl.
That doesn’t help me.

36:41.950 --> 36:45.693
She’d have residue
from making the booby traps.

36:45.788 --> 36:48.575
lfl did it, I would have
cleaned my hands off.

36:48.665 --> 36:51.577
Okay, you do realize you’re
saying things that make you
sound more guilty.

36:51.668 --> 36:54.125
Which means
I’m probably innocent.

36:55.923 --> 36:59.632
This is a well—designed booby trap.
I’m very impressed.

37:02.679 --> 37:05.512
— Is this radioactive?
- No, it’s UV. light...

37:05.599 --> 37:09.091
that will indicate the presence
of benzene and toluene.

37:10.479 --> 37:12.219
- Nothing.
- Well, it’s been a few days.

37:12.314 --> 37:13.815
Those could have been
washed off.

37:13.899 --> 37:15.605
I didn’t kill Deanna.

37:15.692 --> 37:19.025
— I want you to trim
your fingernails.
— No.

37:19.113 --> 37:22.230
— We have a warrant.
- That warrant doesn’t cover
removing parts of her body.

37:22.324 --> 37:23.860
That includes hair and nails.

37:23.951 --> 37:26.909
- Well, am I allowed
to take a scraping?
— No, that’s removing cells.

37:26.995 --> 37:30.328
[Sighs ] Am I allowed to use
a flash of light to look
at her fingernails?

37:30.416 --> 37:32.748
— No.
— Actually, yes, she can.

37:32.835 --> 37:36.248
Hold out your fingers.
Hold ’em out.

37:36.338 --> 37:39.296
- [ Sighs ]
— That’s your bright light?

37:39.383 --> 37:43.376
The spark is brighter
than anything incandescent.

37:46.306 --> 37:48.092
- [ Delores Gasps]
- [ Booth ]
Whoa. What was that?

37:48.183 --> 37:49.684
Phosphorus has a very low
ignition point.

37:49.768 --> 37:54.102
We can use that result to get
a warrant to scrape this hand.

37:54.189 --> 37:57.807
There will be explosive residue
that will match what we found
at the murder scene.

37:57.901 --> 37:59.812
You did it.
You loaded the dragon’s breath.

37:59.903 --> 38:02.610
Either you were mad
that she slept
with your husband—

38:02.698 --> 38:05.861
— Or that she gave him syphilis.
— Or maybe even gave it to you.

38:07.327 --> 38:09.909
The object was to survive.

38:09.997 --> 38:12.238
My husband and I
devoted our lives to that.

38:12.332 --> 38:16.666
Deanna was aggressive,
overbearing, dishonest.

38:16.753 --> 38:19.790
Is that someone you want with
you when you build a new world?

38:19.882 --> 38:21.747
Well, I’m not sure about that.

38:21.842 --> 38:25.209
But I certainly wouldn’t
want someone like you
deciding that for me.

38:28.098 --> 38:31.886
The world is going to end
because of people like her.

Dr. Sweets says you found
a message to me from Deanna?

38:39.151 --> 38:41.483
So l—l found
a letter to you.

38:41.570 --> 38:46.234
Uh— It was very charred
and burned, but I was able
to reconstruct most of it.

38:46.325 --> 38:48.987
It is, uh, very personal.

38:49.077 --> 38:52.535
We were friends,
but we had
a terrible falling out.

38:52.623 --> 38:55.456

I’m sorry, l—l can’t help
but read what I reconstruct.

make you very happy,
