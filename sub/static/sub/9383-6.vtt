10:47.064 --> 10:48.649
Sure. But what's your hurry, ma'am?

10:48.732 --> 10:50.108
Don't you want to play first?

10:50.192 --> 10:54.655
Thank you.
But I really don't approve of gambling.

10:54.738 --> 10:56.448
Technically it's not really gambling.

10:56.532 --> 10:58.700
We're trying to rebuild
our shattered culture...

10:58.784 --> 11:01.119
...after you raped our land
and defiled our women.

11:01.203 --> 11:04.248
As long as you're not using
it for firewater.

11:08.043 --> 11:10.003
Look, a bow tie.

11:11.505 --> 11:12.506
[Singing]

11:12.840 --> 11:14.508
I'm David Bowie.

11:15.801 --> 11:17.469
Bo Derek!

11:19.263 --> 11:22.307
Very funny!
Now tell the one that doesn't suck!

11:22.432 --> 11:23.725
[Laughter and applause]

11:23.809 --> 11:28.021
Thank you. Yes.
And what's the deal with airline food?

11:30.524 --> 11:33.151
Thanks, "Watches You Pee."

11:34.570 --> 11:35.571
PETER: Where's your mother?

11:35.654 --> 11:37.030
Over there.

11:38.657 --> 11:40.576
I didn't know you knew how to play poker.

11:40.659 --> 11:42.077
-Yeah.
-How you doing?

11:42.286 --> 11:44.663
-Yeah.
-That's good, honey. Let's go.

11:44.746 --> 11:45.831
Yeah.

11:50.169 --> 11:53.422
It's funny. I never knew video poker
could be so much fun.

11:53.505 --> 11:56.091
You win a few hands
and all those lights go off.

11:56.175 --> 11:58.552
And you just feel so good inside.

11:58.635 --> 12:01.013
Yeah, gambling is great.
No question about it.

12:01.096 --> 12:03.765
It felt so good.
I kept putting my money in.

12:03.849 --> 12:08.187
And before I knew it, I'd lost $40.
I'm so embarrassed.

12:08.270 --> 12:10.439
That's okay.
As long as you learned your lesson.

12:10.522 --> 12:14.318
I did, Peter, for a couple of minutes.
Then....

12:14.484 --> 12:17.154
This is so silly.
I started playing again.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.614
I could swear I parked here.

12:18.697 --> 12:22.201
Yeah, you did.
But here's the really silly thing, Peter.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.119
I sort of bet our car.

12:24.203 --> 12:25.454
[Exclaiming]

12:25.913 --> 12:28.165
I won't panic.
I need to go back in the casino...

12:28.248 --> 12:31.919
...and find a high roller who'll pay
$1 million to sleep with my wife.

12:32.002 --> 12:33.879
What? That's ridiculous!

12:33.962 --> 12:37.049
These people took $24
for the island of Manhattan.

12:37.132 --> 12:39.843
They have no idea what things are worth!

12:43.514 --> 12:44.681
MEG: Nice going, Mom.

12:44.765 --> 12:48.519
I finally get my driver's license
and you lose the car to a poker machine.

12:48.602 --> 12:49.937
How ironic.

12:50.062 --> 12:53.315
Don't talk about your mother that way.
She is not an iron.

12:53.398 --> 12:55.484
We gotta figure out a way
to get to New York...

12:55.567 --> 12:57.277
...and get Chris back into the Scouts.

12:57.361 --> 12:58.570
But Dad--

12:58.654 --> 13:02.032
I got it.
I'll just get Brian to wire us some money.

13:03.325 --> 13:04.493
[Phone ringing]

13:04.576 --> 13:05.786
[Brian laughing]

13:06.495 --> 13:09.706
Damn it, Julie!
I am not shacking up with my boyfriend.

13:09.790 --> 13:12.042
I am just going away for the weekend.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.545
SCHNEIDER: Yeah. All the away.

13:14.628 --> 13:16.088
[TV audience laughing]

13:16.171 --> 13:17.172
[Hooting]

13:17.256 --> 13:19.925
Damn, Schneider! What won't you say?

13:21.176 --> 13:23.846
No answer at the house.
You didn't bet that, too, did you?

13:23.929 --> 13:27.099
I'm sorry, Peter. I feel so foolish.

13:27.182 --> 13:29.476
It just seemed like such a good cause.

13:29.810 --> 13:33.063
Everyone in the tribe gets a share
in the casino's profits.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.023
-What did you just say?
-"I'm sorry."

13:35.107 --> 13:36.316
-After that.
-"I feel foolish."

13:36.400 --> 13:37.651
-After that.
-"Casino's profits."

13:37.734 --> 13:39.111
-Before that.
-"Everyone in the tribe."

13:39.194 --> 13:40.571
The whole thing.

13:40.654 --> 13:42.030
"Everyone in the tribe
shares the profit?"

13:42.114 --> 13:43.115
That's it! Let's go!

13:44.449 --> 13:46.618
I'm sorry to hear about your misfortune.

13:46.702 --> 13:48.871
But we're not allowed
to return gambling losses.

13:48.954 --> 13:51.415
I think you can make an exception

13:51.498 --> 13:53.959
in our case, Lenny.
See, I'm an Indian, too.

13:54.042 --> 13:55.043
LENNY AND LOIS: Excuse me?

13:55.127 --> 13:56.795
You heard me. I'm a member of your tribe.

13:56.879 --> 13:59.506
And that entitles me to a share
of your wampum, kemosabe.

13:59.590 --> 14:03.844
Whoa. Wait a second. Not so fast.
Tell me of your history, of your past.

14:03.927 --> 14:06.555
I come from a long line of you people.

14:06.889 --> 14:10.434
My great-grandfather's name
was Jeep Grand Cherokee.

14:12.561 --> 14:15.731
I mean, Chief Grand Cherokee.
He was a rainmaker.

14:16.398 --> 14:17.983
[Native singing]

14:19.401 --> 14:21.820
[Singing]
"I'm so happy doing the neutron dance

14:22.654 --> 14:24.740
"I'm just burning doing the neutron dance"

14:24.823 --> 14:27.451
And he also killed a bunch of Krauts
at Wounded Knee.

14:27.534 --> 14:30.120
So are you gonna
give me back my car, or what?

14:30.204 --> 14:33.290
I have to confer with the council
of the elders. You wait here.

14:33.373 --> 14:36.251
Are you nuts, Peter?
You'll never get away with this.

14:36.335 --> 14:38.128
Why not? I've fooled people before.

14:38.212 --> 14:40.422
You remember that time
I pretended to be gay?

14:40.881 --> 14:42.549
[Cheery TV music]

14:43.884 --> 14:46.428
There is no way
they're gonna believe you're an Indian.

14:46.512 --> 14:47.638
LENNY: He's an Indian.

14:47.721 --> 14:48.722
How do you know?

14:48.805 --> 14:51.600
-I can tell.
-You think everyone's an Indian.

14:51.683 --> 14:53.810
He could just be another moocher.

14:53.894 --> 14:55.562
Maybe we can put him through a test.

14:55.646 --> 14:58.941
Like a really impossible stunt
to prove he's the real deal.

14:59.024 --> 15:01.276
Way to think outside the box, Frank.

15:02.861 --> 15:07.449
To prove you are truly a member of our
tribe, you must go on a vision quest.

15:08.951 --> 15:10.869
Do you know what a vision quest is?

15:10.953 --> 15:15.749
Of course I do. I'm an Indian.
But why don't you explain it to my wife?

15:15.832 --> 15:17.626
She's a little slow in the head.

15:17.709 --> 15:20.754
A vision quest is a sacred
spiritual journey.

15:21.004 --> 15:24.007
Your husband must go out
in the wilderness without food or water.

15:24.091 --> 15:26.552
-Or shoes.
-Yeah. Or shoes.

15:26.677 --> 15:29.471
He must remain there
until he can communicate with nature.

15:29.555 --> 15:32.182
He must hear the wisdom
of the rocks and trees.

15:32.266 --> 15:35.727
And then his guiding spirit
must appear to him...

15:35.811 --> 15:37.855
...and reveal a great personal truth.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.190
And it's gotta be a real vision.

15:40.274 --> 15:42.359
We're Indians.
We're gonna know if he's lying.

15:42.568 --> 15:44.570
[Howling ominously]

15:45.779 --> 15:47.781
[Laughing]

15:49.324 --> 15:50.325
Sucker.

15:50.659 --> 15:53.620
LOIS: Peter, please don't do this.
We can buy another car.

15:53.704 --> 15:56.456
I'll give extra piano lessons on Sundays.

15:56.623 --> 15:59.209
Come on.
All I gotta do is have a spiritual vision.

15:59.293 --> 16:01.128
I've had one before.

16:02.087 --> 16:05.382
Oh, my God, Brian.
There's a message in my Alpha Bits.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.050
It says "Ooooo."

16:07.134 --> 16:08.844
Peter, those are Cheerios.

16:09.136 --> 16:11.096
You must begin your journey now.

16:11.180 --> 16:15.767
-Now's your chance to be alone with Dad.
-Are you nuts? I'm not attracted to Dad.

16:15.851 --> 16:19.813
-Tell him you don't want to be in Scouts.
-Thanks, Meg.

16:20.189 --> 16:21.190
Yipes.

16:21.273 --> 16:23.775
Dad, can I come?

16:23.859 --> 16:27.237
-How about it, Lenny?
-What the hey? The more the merrier.

16:27.321 --> 16:31.158
Now get the hell out of here, you nut,
and go have yourself a spiritual vision.

CHRIS: Dad, I'm hungry. Are we gonna die?
PETER: Of course not.

16:41.919 --> 16:44.796

I found my own food in the wild.

They've been gone for over six hours.

16:58.894 --> 17:01.313
How long do these vision quests
usually take?

17:02.022 --> 17:03.440
It varies.

17:03.524 --> 17:07.903
It depends on the person's age,
and height, and sign.

17:08.028 --> 17:09.571
You have no idea, do you?

17:09.655 --> 17:11.782
Of course I.... No.

17:12.157 --> 17:14.076
Why would you send
my husband and son out...

17:14.159 --> 17:17.037
...into the wilderness without
any food or supplies?

17:17.120 --> 17:19.456
Because we really like your car?

17:40.185 --> 17:41.186
What?

17:41.270 --> 17:43.021
I say, "Hot enough for you?"

17:43.105 --> 17:47.150
Yeah. I guess. Oh, my God!
I'm communicating with nature!

17:47.860 --> 17:52.614
Tree, if one of you falls and there's
no one around, do you make a noise?

17:52.698 --> 17:54.491
Are you kidding? Scott fell last week.

-He hasn't shut up about it since.
-Sure. Stand there and bitch!

17:58.287 --> 18:01.081

to help me?

of a Tuscadero sandwich?

18:14.261 --> 18:16.805
Yeah. But I'm your spiritual guide, see?

18:16.889 --> 18:18.974
I want to lay a little
personal truth on you.

And Griffin, right now, your son needs
you to listen to him. Whoa!

18:28.358 --> 18:31.737
Sure. Whatever you say. Fonzie?

18:32.154 --> 18:35.741

to ask you. You were with a lot of girls.

I just don't have fun there.

-I guess you're pretty disappointed in me.
-Yeah!

-What? You want to draw?

just stick a knife in my heart?

19:07.814 --> 19:12.361
-I mean, so you drew this?
-Yeah. I know they suck.

Not all of them.
Some of these look pretty good.

19:15.906 --> 19:17.699
-Really?
-Yeah!

19:17.783 --> 19:20.327

-No. She.... Yeah.

Really? What's the Fonz like?
I bet he's stuck up.

20:20.554 --> 20:23.974
I want a spiritual vision, too! Man!

20:24.558 --> 20:26.727
I guess we've lost touch
with our noble roots.

Stewie, that's a terrible thing to say.

20:46.622 --> 20:49.124

has lost their way.

But most Native Americans are proud...

20:51.835 --> 20:55.672
...hardworking people
who are true to their spiritual heritage.

20:55.756 --> 20:58.050
They are certainly not savages.

20:59.593 --> 21:00.594
That's funny, Mother.

21:00.677 --> 21:05.015
Just this morning you said they were lazy
like the dirty Mexicans. Just kidding.

21:05.098 --> 21:09.228
The Mexicans are a clean and industrious
people with a rich cultural heritage.

21:10.479 --> 21:13.357
Yeah. Not like those dumb,
gargantuan Swedes.

21:13.440 --> 21:16.944
Actually, the Swedish people run
the gamut from very short to tall.

21:17.027 --> 21:20.822
