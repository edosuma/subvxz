[dog whining]

01:37.055 --> 01:39.892
We'll go out in a sec, Stevie,
I promise, okay?

01:47.316 --> 01:49.109
[Frances] Oh, shit.

01:50.736 --> 01:51.778
Can I get some?

01:52.237 --> 01:54.573
Yeah, but we're out of milk.

01:54.907 --> 01:58.076
- [Frances] Ask a neighbor.
- Go fuck yourself.

02:01.538 --> 02:03.290
[Sidney] Um, put the seat up this time.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.375
[knock on door]

02:05.459 --> 02:06.460
I got it.

02:12.341 --> 02:14.343
[Frances] Thanks for coming.
I'm totally out.

02:14.426 --> 02:17.012
No problem. I'm kind of in a rush here.

02:17.095 --> 02:18.495
[Frances] Yeah, let me get my cash.

02:23.018 --> 02:24.561
So you're Frances' hookup.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.773
- And you're?
- His landlord.

02:28.607 --> 02:29.816
For a few days.

02:29.900 --> 02:31.460
[Frances] Sidney's in the band with me.

02:35.072 --> 02:36.365
[Tom] Thanks, dude.

02:44.623 --> 02:46.041
Can I get his number?

02:49.002 --> 02:50.879
Maybe I want to buy from him instead.

02:52.548 --> 02:55.634
Oh, and FYI, Ambien really brings out
your dark side.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.636
- I hope I didn't...
- [Sidney] It's cool, dude.

03:01.473 --> 03:02.808
[Frances] Do you have a towel?

03:04.268 --> 03:05.519
Just use mine.

Babe, your pass.

03:49.313 --> 03:50.314
[conductor] Thank you.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.400
I still don't feel good
about this afternoon.

03:53.483 --> 03:54.776
I think we should reschedule.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.445
If we're both in the room,

03:56.528 --> 03:58.947
Dolly's gonna think
it's a much bigger deal than it is.

03:59.531 --> 04:02.618
Okay, but text me
directly afterwards, okay?

04:03.035 --> 04:04.203
Of course.

04:13.420 --> 04:14.880
I miss you already.

05:48.140 --> 05:50.517
Oh, and you don't have to be
jealous anymore.

05:54.188 --> 05:55.314
Why?

05:56.607 --> 05:59.484
Of Sam. He blocked me on Instagram,

05:59.568 --> 06:02.154
and... I don't know, at first I thought

06:02.237 --> 06:04.281
it was just Emily and her bitchy ways,

06:04.364 --> 06:08.911
but then I realized he must have seen
the photo of us.

06:11.705 --> 06:12.789
What photo?

06:14.416 --> 06:16.543
Don't be mad.
I know I said I deleted it, but...

06:23.008 --> 06:24.593
It's mostly just fans of Vagabonds,

06:24.676 --> 06:27.846
and a lot of comments
about how hot you are.

06:28.931 --> 06:30.724
And I can't argue with that.

06:33.143 --> 06:34.978
Well, wait, are you sure?

06:35.062 --> 06:37.648
I mean, how do you even know
he saw the pic?

06:38.232 --> 06:40.400
Come on, it would totally set him off.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.028
My sexuality and all that shit.

06:51.453 --> 06:53.163
You sure you can't come over?

06:53.830 --> 06:55.374
I have an appointment.

06:57.084 --> 07:00.087
Therapy. Happy?

07:01.880 --> 07:03.382
Do you talk about me?

07:05.634 --> 07:06.927
Maybe.

07:20.232 --> 07:22.109
- Bye.
- Bye.

07:35.789 --> 07:36.957
[car horn honks]

07:39.501 --> 07:42.629
[Larin] Jean, there's a woman asking
for you in the front.

07:43.422 --> 07:45.465
- Oh, yeah?
- Says she's Allison's mom.

07:48.677 --> 07:51.597
I've been trying to get in touch with her
for the past 48 hours,

07:51.680 --> 07:54.516
and I know she usually comes here
on Wednesdays.

07:54.933 --> 07:59.188
Well, she often changes the schedule,
so she's not actually coming today.

08:00.522 --> 08:01.940
[woman] Has she reached out?

08:02.858 --> 08:05.277
Look, Margaret, um...

08:05.360 --> 08:07.863
I can confirm
that Allison is my patient,

08:07.946 --> 08:12.451
but I can't really divulge any details,
by law.

08:12.534 --> 08:15.662
This is an extenuating circumstance,
don't you think?

08:16.246 --> 08:18.749
- Are you guys in touch?
- What do you mean?

08:18.832 --> 08:20.918
She's been living with me
the last few months.

08:22.085 --> 08:24.046
- Living with you? I thought...
- Yeah.

08:26.465 --> 08:28.884
- What about Tom?
- Who's Tom?

08:30.761 --> 08:34.306
It's a friend of hers
she mentioned once.

08:35.390 --> 08:38.894
Well, we had a fight,
much worse than usual.

08:42.105 --> 08:43.982
And I've been feeling incredibly guilty

08:44.066 --> 08:47.069
because she left,
and I haven't heard from her,

08:47.152 --> 08:51.782
and I figured I've been giving her money
to come see you four times a week,

08:51.865 --> 08:53.742
so you must know more than me.

08:55.035 --> 08:59.831
Look, like I said, our sessions
are completely confidential, so...

09:00.624 --> 09:05.170
I'm so worried that I upset her
to the point where she might

09:05.254 --> 09:07.172
get back involved with drugs again.

09:07.673 --> 09:10.050
Yeah, I understand your concern.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.012
When I hear from her,

09:14.096 --> 09:17.224
I can promise you
I will have her contact you.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.397
How are you feeling?

09:23.480 --> 09:25.482
I was sorry to hear about your health.

09:25.566 --> 09:27.484
I'm fine, what do you mean?

09:29.152 --> 09:30.404
Nothing.

09:50.090 --> 09:53.135
[papers rustling]

10:03.770 --> 10:05.189
[phone ringing]

10:05.772 --> 10:06.773
[voice mail beeps]

10:07.399 --> 10:09.193
Allison, this is Jean.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.653
Uh, can you call me when you get this?

10:12.279 --> 10:13.322
Thanks.

10:33.217 --> 10:35.427
[Larin] Hey, what was Allison's mother
doing here?

10:35.719 --> 10:37.763
She wanted to book a family session.

10:38.096 --> 10:39.573
They're working hard
on their relationship.

10:39.597 --> 10:41.432
She hasn't heard of a phone?

10:41.767 --> 10:48.315
Yeah, I guess she lives nearby
and wanted to talk it through in person.

10:49.107 --> 10:51.735
- [Gary] Allison wasn't present?
- No.

10:53.946 --> 10:55.466
She been keeping up with her meetings?

10:56.240 --> 10:58.784
Yeah, she's committed to her recovery.

10:59.826 --> 11:00.827
I told you.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.331
Okay.

11:05.290 --> 11:06.458
[Jean] So...

11:20.305 --> 11:21.473
Allison?

12:05.142 --> 12:06.643
Allison.

12:12.816 --> 12:15.360
[gasps]

12:19.031 --> 12:22.409
[saw buzzing]

12:22.492 --> 12:25.495
[chattering]

12:38.175 --> 12:40.093
Hi. I'm looking for Tom.

12:40.802 --> 12:43.347
He moved out, can't you tell?

12:43.847 --> 12:45.724
Do you know where I might find him?

12:46.058 --> 12:47.809
[laughing] Don't ask, don't tell.

12:50.062 --> 12:53.398
It's a joke. Smile, lady.

12:53.482 --> 12:55.067
Yeah, well, I was, uh...

12:55.692 --> 12:58.403
I was actually looking for a girl
who used to live here.

12:59.071 --> 13:01.573
- Allison?
- Yeah, have you seen her?

13:02.032 --> 13:03.992
Nah, she ain't been here for a while.

13:04.409 --> 13:06.787
You got a name, Curious George?

13:06.870 --> 13:08.121
You know what? Um...

13:08.539 --> 13:10.165
Don't worry, thanks.

13:23.177 --> 13:24.177
[door opens]

13:24.721 --> 13:26.723
- Mommy!
- See, she's still here.

13:26.807 --> 13:29.685
- [Jean] Hey, sweetie.
- Hi, Mommy.

13:33.272 --> 13:35.440
A lovely girl, just lovely.

13:36.441 --> 13:38.861
So, we worked on a checklist.

13:40.195 --> 13:42.573
She tested high on the scale for ADHD.

13:42.906 --> 13:45.784
Yeah, I've looked at that test,
and those variables seem...

13:45.868 --> 13:47.369
Yeah, I've heard the criticisms,

13:47.452 --> 13:51.123
but I'm trained to see what parents tend
to want to gloss over.

13:51.748 --> 13:56.128
Something else to consider,
children who exhibit ADHD tendencies

13:56.211 --> 13:58.755
are six times more likely
to express gender variance.

13:58.839 --> 14:02.301
I've been reading up
on gender dysphoria, so...

14:02.384 --> 14:04.428
Well, as you know, then...

14:06.138 --> 14:08.557
this may become about her sexuality,
but for now,

14:08.640 --> 14:11.101
definitely just keep allowing her
to express herself.

14:12.019 --> 14:13.395
How are things at home?

14:14.938 --> 14:15.939
Good.

14:17.274 --> 14:19.276
I mean, yeah, great.

14:20.027 --> 14:21.904
Marriage relations are good?

14:22.905 --> 14:23.906
Yes.

14:24.573 --> 14:27.117
Anyone working longer hours,
changes in routine?

14:28.076 --> 14:30.287
Well, my husband is working on a project

14:30.370 --> 14:33.290
that is a little more demanding
than usual.

14:33.707 --> 14:34.917
What about you?

14:36.960 --> 14:38.253
You're the primary caregiver.

14:38.337 --> 14:42.716
Are there any changes in your behavior,
mood, personal conflicts?

14:44.134 --> 14:45.594
Nothing out of the ordinary.

14:46.178 --> 14:48.013
Good, well...

14:49.515 --> 14:54.311
I am going to recommend
that Dolly try a period of medication.

14:58.941 --> 15:01.401
I just figured I'd get
the prescription filled.

15:01.485 --> 15:03.725
I didn't say I was gonna
actually start giving it to her.

15:03.779 --> 15:05.322
I want to get a second opinion,

15:05.405 --> 15:07.050
because I don't think
she needs to be medicated...

15:07.074 --> 15:09.701
I think you'll find every doctor's
gonna say the same thing.

15:09.785 --> 15:11.119
We'll just make sure.

15:11.954 --> 15:13.674
Do you want to speak
to the doctor yourself?

15:13.705 --> 15:15.374
I mean, it feels like you don't trust me.

15:15.541 --> 15:17.793
I didn't say that.
Don't put words into my mouth.

15:17.876 --> 15:19.253
I do think that you're convinced

15:19.336 --> 15:21.064
that if you can take care
of her learning issues,

15:21.088 --> 15:22.941
then that'll solve other things
that you're concerned about.

15:22.965 --> 15:26.260
No, I'm not saying that at all.
I just want to stay on top of her grades,

15:26.343 --> 15:28.804
and that seems like the only thing
we can control here.

15:28.886 --> 15:33.349
But we can't. Dolly isn't like you.

15:34.226 --> 15:36.436
Not as a student,
not in the way that she dresses,

15:36.520 --> 15:37.688
and that's okay.

15:38.021 --> 15:39.857
I'm not sure where all this
is coming from.

15:39.940 --> 15:42.484
It feels like you have a lot
of pent-up anger on the issue.

15:42.818 --> 15:45.404
Hey, don't analyze me right now, okay?

15:45.487 --> 15:47.447
Daddy, I'm brushed. Can you tuck me in?

15:47.531 --> 15:50.200
Yes, of course I can.
Come on, sweetie.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.278
[Sam]
I have something I wanted to show you.

17:08.987 --> 17:11.281
At first I wasn't sure what I should do.

17:15.617 --> 17:20.205
She was such a part of me,
it made sense she left a mark.

17:24.044 --> 17:25.753
So it's a phoenix.

17:25.838 --> 17:28.173
The phoenix bird periodically
burns itself to death,

17:28.257 --> 17:30.133
and then reemerges from the ashes.

17:30.383 --> 17:34.929
Emily thought it made sense,
the symbolism, since I'm rebuilding.

17:35.429 --> 17:38.432
I'm glad things are going so well
with Emily.

17:39.560 --> 17:41.895
- Are you?
- Yeah.

17:42.855 --> 17:45.315
Of course, what do you mean?

17:47.276 --> 17:48.527
I figured it out.

17:50.946 --> 17:52.155
- Sam...
- No.

17:53.282 --> 17:55.284
You want me to be hooked on Sidney.

17:56.451 --> 17:59.496
Keeps me sick and needing you.

18:00.038 --> 18:01.331
Makes you powerful.

18:01.415 --> 18:03.417
Look, Sam, I, um...

18:04.334 --> 18:08.380
I know things ended on a strange note
in our last session,

18:08.463 --> 18:13.260
but I was just pushing you
to challenge your feelings.

18:13.844 --> 18:15.929
I mean, that's my job, to help you.

18:16.597 --> 18:19.266
You know, I wanted to believe
Sidney was a curse.

18:20.142 --> 18:24.897
This... virus, this terrible thing.

18:26.398 --> 18:28.442
But I've started
to see things differently.

18:29.568 --> 18:30.819
She was a gift.

18:31.612 --> 18:34.656
In fact, without her,
I never would have gotten to you.

18:35.072 --> 18:38.534
And you helped me change,
which brought me back to Emily,

18:38.619 --> 18:39.828
where I actually belong.

18:40.329 --> 18:41.455
That's good.

18:41.538 --> 18:43.916
Remember what you told me
when she stole Stevie?

18:43.999 --> 18:46.835
Anything that connected me to Sidney
was time to let go.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.630
But there's still one thing I need
to let go of.

18:53.342 --> 18:54.342
You.

18:57.387 --> 19:00.349
You are the last remaining thing
that connects me to Sidney.

19:01.225 --> 19:04.853
And I’m finally in a really good place
and making major life decisions.

19:05.187 --> 19:07.347
And as I look ahead,
I was never someone who saw myself

19:07.397 --> 19:09.107
in therapy forever, you know?

19:09.775 --> 19:14.613
Wait, Sam.
Sidney's just one of our topics in here,

19:16.490 --> 19:18.158
a better way to understand you.

19:18.242 --> 19:19.785
You taught me really well.

19:20.327 --> 19:21.870
I'm taking responsibility.

19:22.246 --> 19:24.414
But as long as you're in my life,
she is, too.

19:24.748 --> 19:27.251
I don't think
you should quit therapy, Sam.

19:28.210 --> 19:30.254
We still have a lot of work to do.

19:30.337 --> 19:32.256
I'll always have work to do.

19:32.339 --> 19:35.884
But I want to enjoy my life,
not just talk about all the issues.

19:38.178 --> 19:40.430
Honestly, it'll probably be good
for you, too.

19:41.431 --> 19:43.267
We still have a few minutes.

19:43.849 --> 19:46.852
I'm good, that's okay.

19:46.936 --> 19:48.938
I'd like to finish
this conversation, Sam...

20:05.581 --> 20:09.376
[gasping]

20:19.802 --> 20:22.805
[breathing heavily]

20:56.632 --> 20:58.342
Yes, hi, um...

20:58.425 --> 21:01.512
I'm looking for Melissa Saugraves.

21:02.095 --> 21:03.680
Does she still work there?

21:05.933 --> 21:08.477
Okay, do you know where?

21:12.439 --> 21:15.025
Thank you, thank you.

21:22.282 --> 21:25.410
There's something I wanted to tell you.

21:25.494 --> 21:28.163
- What, what is it?
- Promise you won't judge me?

21:28.247 --> 21:29.790
- No, I won't.
- Yes, you will.

21:29.873 --> 21:32.125
Okay, fine, tell me anyway.

21:32.835 --> 21:37.089
- I am sort of dating someone.
- Really, who?

21:37.172 --> 21:40.217
Well, that's the thing, it's Daryl.

21:40.634 --> 21:44.555
Wow. Oh, my God. Well, what happened?

21:44.638 --> 21:47.224
Well, he broke up
with that high school hooker of his,

21:47.307 --> 21:48.809
and we were hanging out more.

21:48.892 --> 21:51.353
We just had to go over some stuff
for the divorce, and...

21:52.813 --> 21:54.356
it's actually been so nice.

21:55.274 --> 21:57.442
I am not getting ahead of myself, though.

21:57.943 --> 21:59.987
That's very evolved of you.

22:00.404 --> 22:02.990
Seriously, I'm really happy for you.

22:03.073 --> 22:05.742
Thank you.
I actually haven't told anyone.

22:05.826 --> 22:06.827
Oh, um...

22:07.452 --> 22:09.913
Uh, Greek salad,
dressing on the side, please.

22:09.997 --> 22:11.039
Lamb gyro, please.

22:11.121 --> 22:12.623
[vendor] Greek salad. Lamb Gyro.

22:12.706 --> 22:15.459
[laughs] I'm just worried
people are gonna judge me.

22:15.878 --> 22:17.462
He cheated on me, and I...

22:17.838 --> 22:20.257
Well, honestly, I'm realizing...

22:20.757 --> 22:23.719
you should never judge something
you don't understand.

22:24.426 --> 22:25.845
So I'm happy for you.

22:31.810 --> 22:36.023
Oh, hey, I'm looking for Allison.
Have you guys seen her?

22:37.316 --> 22:38.692
You're her mom, right?

22:39.276 --> 22:42.738
No, no. She hasn't been here
in a few days.

22:43.530 --> 22:44.698
Sorry.

22:46.742 --> 22:47.951
Okay.

22:51.203 --> 22:54.206
[children chattering]

22:57.085 --> 22:58.754
[woman] You should be ready by now.

23:09.348 --> 23:13.060
[chattering]

23:15.938 --> 23:17.439
[Dolly] But it's not fair!

23:17.523 --> 23:20.817
[Michelle] If something were to go wrong,
that would be very dangerous.

23:22.194 --> 23:23.737
But Peter Pan flies.

23:23.820 --> 23:25.781
There'd be no magic if he doesn't fly.

23:25.864 --> 23:27.241
[Jean] Hey, what's going on?

23:27.324 --> 23:29.535
One of the chains
holding the harness up broke.

23:29.618 --> 23:30.827
We don't have time to fix it.

23:30.911 --> 23:33.539
Oh, well, I can take it
to the shop. I don't mind.

23:33.622 --> 23:35.916
- The apparatus is so old.
- It's not worth the risk.

23:35.999 --> 23:38.961
- We can pretend.
- I don't want to pretend.

23:39.461 --> 23:41.755
Hold on.
Here, come here, sweetie.

23:41.839 --> 23:44.258
Listen, calm down, okay?

23:44.341 --> 23:48.303
It's okay, I'm gonna fix it, okay?
Mommy's got a plan, all right?

23:48.387 --> 23:50.681
Now you just go
and rehearse with your friends,

23:50.764 --> 23:53.892
my little sweet Peter Pan, okay?

23:55.269 --> 23:56.436
[sighs]

24:13.912 --> 24:14.913
Busted.

24:15.831 --> 24:18.917
And here I thought you were the rare,
well-adjusted career mom.

24:19.001 --> 24:20.127
Oh, shut up.

24:20.210 --> 24:22.588
I'm just happy to see
that you have a wild side, Jean.

24:22.671 --> 24:24.798
[laughs] Maybe we can actually be friends.

24:24.882 --> 24:28.385
Yeah, it's more anxious than rebellious
these days, but hey.

24:28.468 --> 24:30.137
Well, if you ever need,

24:30.220 --> 24:32.681
I basically have a pharmacy on me
at all times.

24:45.360 --> 24:46.570
[clears throat]

24:48.363 --> 24:50.199
- Hey.
- So, um,

24:50.282 --> 24:51.533
I've been going over it.

24:51.950 --> 24:54.369
- What?
- The rumor.

24:54.870 --> 24:58.248
And how nobody here will look at me
in the fucking eye and what Scott said.

24:58.332 --> 24:59.583
- All of it.
- Okay.

24:59.666 --> 25:03.045
And you're the one
that told everyone about Texas.

25:05.130 --> 25:06.381
[Alexis] Michael, I...

25:06.465 --> 25:08.217
Just admit it, Alexis.

25:11.343 --> 25:14.930
Do you have any idea
how fucking angry that makes me?

25:15.015 --> 25:18.018
You have put me
in an impossible position here,

25:18.101 --> 25:21.730
and you lied to me to my face,
and I thought I was being really nice,

25:21.813 --> 25:24.459
you know, including you in the case,
and taking you to Texas, and...

25:24.483 --> 25:26.026
I can explain. That is...

25:26.109 --> 25:27.110
I don't want you to.

25:29.321 --> 25:31.073
I know why it happened.

25:32.032 --> 25:33.033
Do you?

25:36.078 --> 25:41.291
I care about you,
and I don't feel fucking good about it.

25:41.792 --> 25:44.920
But nothing is going to happen between us.

25:45.546 --> 25:48.674
I need you to know that
and understand that.

25:48.757 --> 25:52.553
And if you do,
then you should come back to my desk.

25:55.430 --> 25:56.682
I understand.

26:09.610 --> 26:11.612
[shower running]

26:18.370 --> 26:21.164
[phone ringing]

26:28.462 --> 26:29.462
[sighs]

26:34.678 --> 26:36.680
My mom will be here in a second.

26:38.056 --> 26:39.850
All right, I'll be down soon.

26:42.851 --> 26:45.896
- [slapping sound]
- [panting]

27:04.581 --> 27:09.503
- [doorbell rings]
- [knock on door]

27:13.674 --> 27:14.800
[sighs]

27:15.052 --> 27:16.470
- Hi, Mom.
- Hello.

27:16.553 --> 27:17.679
You're early.

27:17.763 --> 27:20.974
No, look, I'm right on time, actually.

27:22.641 --> 27:23.684
[kisses]

27:23.769 --> 27:26.188
You look tired,
haven't you been sleeping?

27:26.271 --> 27:28.190
Nice to see you, too. Come on in.

27:28.273 --> 27:33.779
What? That's not a criticism.
I'm concerned that you look tired.

27:33.862 --> 27:35.739
You can tell me if I look tired.

27:35.822 --> 27:37.032
[Jean sighs]

27:37.115 --> 27:38.367
Where's my grandchild?

27:38.450 --> 27:40.410
Oh, she's upstairs
finishing her homework.

27:40.494 --> 27:41.954
Can I get you something to drink?

27:42.037 --> 27:44.206
Well, I won't say no to an aperitif.

27:44.289 --> 27:46.041
One thing I really don't understand.

27:46.124 --> 27:48.961
Why don't you and Michael hire
a full-time housekeeper?

27:49.503 --> 27:51.839
I like my privacy.

27:51.922 --> 27:54.299
Well, it's hard to live in chaos.

27:55.884 --> 27:57.010
[Jean] Cheers.

27:57.970 --> 27:59.513
What are you so anxious about?

27:59.596 --> 28:01.223
I'm not, I'm fine, Mom.

28:01.723 --> 28:02.641
[scoffs]

28:02.724 --> 28:06.228
You might be good at fooling others,
but I know you, Jeanie.

28:06.603 --> 28:08.772
I'm not trying to fool anyone.

28:10.190 --> 28:14.236
I mean, just think if you had to live
in that one-bedroom apartment.

28:14.319 --> 28:15.904
I like that apartment.

28:15.986 --> 28:19.239
Oh, I know, I'm still paying for it.

28:19.324 --> 28:21.451
Can you keep your voice down, please?

28:21.535 --> 28:23.120
Yes, yes.

28:24.997 --> 28:27.999
I know it's the secrets
that you think won't kill you

28:28.458 --> 28:30.627
that always do, though.

28:31.460 --> 28:32.460
Remember that.

28:35.799 --> 28:37.593
- [Dolly] Grandma, Grandma!
- Oh!

28:37.676 --> 28:40.095
Dolly, what did we say about the iPad?
That's enough.

28:40.179 --> 28:44.433
Sweetheart, is it possible you have
grown since your birthday party?

28:44.516 --> 28:47.060
- Yes, I'm nine now.
- [Nancy] Oh, gosh.

28:47.144 --> 28:50.772
[Michael] Hello, Nancy.
Lovely to see you, as usual.

28:50.856 --> 28:52.691
You're so damn handsome.

28:52.774 --> 28:55.068
And he just gets better with age,
doesn't he?

28:57.863 --> 29:00.782
Mom, do you want one
a little more well done?

29:00.866 --> 29:03.869
No, no, this is just fine.

29:04.618 --> 29:07.079
I mean, you know
that I prefer vegetables anyway.

29:07.162 --> 29:10.332
Very cruel to eat animals.

29:13.086 --> 29:15.631
Well, sweetheart, are you ready
for your big night?

29:15.714 --> 29:16.882
[Dolly] I think so.

29:17.299 --> 29:19.635
Have you been working on your curtsy?

29:19.718 --> 29:20.886
What's a curtsy?

29:21.426 --> 29:23.707
[Nancy] What actresses do at the end
of the performance...

29:24.473 --> 29:25.807
during the curtain call.

29:26.600 --> 29:28.060
[Dolly] We hold hands and bow.

29:28.560 --> 29:31.104
Which is perfectly acceptable these days.

29:32.648 --> 29:36.777
Oh, I just remembered,
when Jean tried out to be,

29:36.860 --> 29:39.613
what was that, Cinderella, yeah.

29:39.696 --> 29:42.491
Well, she didn't get the part.
She only made chorus.

29:42.574 --> 29:44.660
Oh, she was so angry.

29:44.743 --> 29:48.413
She had it in for the girl who made it.
I mean, it was rage.

29:48.497 --> 29:52.459
I remember thinking,
this is a serious child.

29:52.543 --> 29:54.169
And then, just like that...

29:55.085 --> 29:58.380
she became absolutely infatuated
with her, didn't you?

29:58.924 --> 30:00.801
That's not how the story went at all, Mom.

30:00.884 --> 30:03.095
I wasn't angry.
I don't know what you're talking about.

30:03.178 --> 30:05.097
I never heard you wanted
to be Cinderella.

30:05.180 --> 30:06.014
[Jean] I didn't.

30:06.098 --> 30:10.269
[Nancy] No, when Jeanie sets her mind
to something, she's fierce.

30:10.352 --> 30:12.729
Well, I know that. She's unstoppable.

30:13.230 --> 30:16.358
[Nancy] And then,
if she doesn't get it, whoo!

30:16.900 --> 30:18.485
She can't quite swallow it.

30:18.902 --> 30:21.196
Like when she was rejected by Stanford.

30:22.447 --> 30:23.699
[chuckling]

30:24.241 --> 30:29.037
You know, you still have never replaced
that ceramic elephant you broke.

30:29.663 --> 30:31.874
I didn't know you wanted to go
to Stanford, either.

30:31.957 --> 30:33.834
You know what?
That was a long time ago.

30:33.917 --> 30:37.713
And I really don't think we need
to go down memory lane right now.

30:49.558 --> 30:52.019
[sighs]

31:08.952 --> 31:11.496
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

31:12.706 --> 31:14.458
As short as you like.

31:15.751 --> 31:18.795
- Okay.
- Wait!

31:21.131 --> 31:23.342
Thanks so much, Mommy, I love you.

31:25.928 --> 31:31.767
Baby, I love you, too. So much.

31:34.144 --> 31:35.812
All right.

31:50.202 --> 31:52.120
[Dolly giggling]

31:52.204 --> 31:54.206
- [Dolly] Yay!
- [Jean] Do you like it?

31:54.289 --> 31:55.666
[both laughing]

31:56.333 --> 31:59.503
Hey, even if it was just as a "fuck you"
to your mom, I'm proud of you.

32:00.003 --> 32:03.257
That's not why I did it, not entirely.

32:10.556 --> 32:13.350
If there really was a Neverland,
would you go?

32:15.686 --> 32:17.521
Is that a serious question?

32:19.147 --> 32:21.984
Well, I'd be curious
for a little bit, but...

32:23.567 --> 32:25.360
it always ends up the same.

32:28.031 --> 32:29.408
Just routine.

32:30.784 --> 32:35.372
Yeah, we kid ourselves if we think
that anyone or anyplace is gonna...

32:37.958 --> 32:39.418
offer an escape.

32:54.016 --> 32:56.518
I made an appointment
with Dr. Rothman again.

32:57.060 --> 32:58.979
Is it anything specific?

32:59.855 --> 33:02.900
No, just... just good to check in.

33:03.609 --> 33:06.612
I mean, I only stopped 'cause I got busy.

33:30.759 --> 33:33.929
- [shower running]
- [Jean sobbing]

34:41.331 --> 34:45.418
[chattering]

34:49.840 --> 34:52.050
[cheering]

34:52.134 --> 34:53.177
Oh, good!

34:53.675 --> 34:57.554
So, she'll run up these steps,
against this backdrop,

34:57.637 --> 34:58.972
and it'll look like she's flying.

34:59.057 --> 35:01.310
[Blair] What a lifesaver, brilliant!

35:01.894 --> 35:04.605
- I guess it works.
- It's a great idea, Jean.

35:04.688 --> 35:07.441
Thanks, I guess I just have
a wild imagination.

35:07.524 --> 35:10.485
- Do you have any fairy dust, too?
- I wish.

35:11.069 --> 35:13.488
- [woman] Should we try it?
- Yeah.

35:13.572 --> 35:16.783
- [woman] Where's Dolly?
- Um, I'll go find her. Hold on one sec.

35:34.466 --> 35:37.093
[phone swooshes, dinging]

35:50.400 --> 35:52.152
[sighs]

35:59.868 --> 36:01.537
[tapping on window] Jean!

36:03.455 --> 36:06.166
- Hey, Holly.
- Hey, are you picking up your mom?

36:06.250 --> 36:07.250
Uh, yeah.

36:07.292 --> 36:09.837
Oh, I'm grabbing my sister. How funny.

36:09.920 --> 36:11.547
Is she getting in now?

36:11.628 --> 36:15.465
Oh, there she is.
Okay, I'll see you at school.

36:15.548 --> 36:16.800
Perfect.

36:40.617 --> 36:41.702
[knocks on window]

36:44.452 --> 36:45.453
Hey.

36:46.456 --> 36:47.958
You drive a mom car.

36:48.041 --> 36:50.419
It's my sister's. Get in.

37:02.681 --> 37:04.808
I can't believe you showed up like this.

37:04.892 --> 37:07.811
Well, maybe I'm not gonna let you
off the hook so easily anymore.

37:08.729 --> 37:09.938
What does that mean?

37:10.731 --> 37:13.942
It means you can't keep playing
the same game, Diane.

37:17.196 --> 37:18.864
So what happened with Sam?

37:20.240 --> 37:21.491
Everything okay?

37:22.868 --> 37:24.494
Depends what you mean by okay.

37:25.787 --> 37:27.497
He's fucking engaged.

37:27.581 --> 37:29.750
- What?
- To Emily.

37:31.541 --> 37:35.795
- Oh, wow, surprising.
- Yeah, I know, right?

37:35.879 --> 37:38.840
And it's just a band-aid,
it's so fucking obvious.

37:38.926 --> 37:41.053
Yeah, you're probably right.

37:42.429 --> 37:45.974
But you can't control what he does,
and maybe...

37:46.765 --> 37:47.932
maybe he really loves her.

37:48.016 --> 37:49.309
He doesn't.

37:49.394 --> 37:51.647
- Well, you don't know that.
- Yeah, I do.

37:51.730 --> 37:54.566
Well, what I can't understand
is why you're so upset.

37:55.400 --> 37:58.028
I mean, you've said yourself
you're not interested in him, right?

37:58.111 --> 37:59.111
I'm not.

37:59.154 --> 38:02.282
So let him make his own choices,
with Emily, or whoever.

38:03.033 --> 38:05.035
I mean,
you're out there, living your life,

38:05.118 --> 38:06.678
not giving a shit about what he thinks.

38:06.703 --> 38:09.081
Well, you have no idea
what my life's like.

38:09.164 --> 38:11.041
I only know what you tell me.

38:11.124 --> 38:14.711
I know nothing about yours.
Absolutely nothing.

38:15.170 --> 38:16.505
That's not true.

38:16.922 --> 38:18.799
Take me to your niece's play, then.

38:22.469 --> 38:27.599
Look, I have a complicated relationship
with my mother and my sister.

38:28.016 --> 38:30.394
It's just not the right time
for me right now.

38:32.688 --> 38:33.772
Of course.

38:35.274 --> 38:40.362
Everyone's just moving on
with their lives, and I'm just left alone.

38:41.655 --> 38:44.491
And now, even Sam, I mean,
he's fucking gone, too.

38:46.910 --> 38:48.745
I mean, why am I here?

38:49.663 --> 38:51.874
Seriously, what the fuck is wrong with me?

38:51.957 --> 38:53.917
You're some fucking stranger who comes in,

38:54.001 --> 38:56.253
get coffee
whenever you fucking feel like it.

38:58.714 --> 39:02.801
I mean,
you keep saying I fuck with people?

39:03.427 --> 39:05.387
But you're clearly the one fucking
with me.

39:05.470 --> 39:08.515
Hey, hey, don't... don't say that.

39:09.892 --> 39:11.143
It's not true.

39:13.770 --> 39:14.771
Sorry.

39:18.567 --> 39:19.693
You're right.

39:22.654 --> 39:25.324
I wish I could be more transparent, but...

39:28.619 --> 39:31.622
it's difficult for me
to let people in sometimes.

39:41.089 --> 39:44.259
Why don't you come over
to my place next week?

39:46.345 --> 39:47.471
Would you like that?

39:47.969 --> 39:50.263
That'll be good for both of us.

39:53.393 --> 39:56.063
Yeah, I'd like that.

40:37.020 --> 40:38.146
[car door opening]

40:39.439 --> 40:40.439
[chuckles]

40:41.108 --> 40:42.150
Need a ride?

40:42.651 --> 40:45.195
Well, if it's not too inconvenient, yes.

40:50.367 --> 40:55.664
- Who was that, Jean?
- Who? Just a friend, Mom.

40:55.747 --> 40:57.833
Right, of course.

40:58.709 --> 41:01.170
Look, why don't you go
into the auditorium?

41:01.253 --> 41:04.631
I'm just gonna go
and check on Dolly backstage.

41:05.215 --> 41:07.217
All right. Save you two seats?

41:16.435 --> 41:18.395
<i>Hey, this is Sam. Leave a message.</i>

41:18.478 --> 41:19.313
[voice mail beeps]

41:19.396 --> 41:24.651
Hi, uh, I've been thinking a lot,
and I would really like to see you again.

41:25.527 --> 41:28.113
So call me back when you get this, please.

41:29.531 --> 41:30.782
Thanks, Sam.

42:01.313 --> 42:03.482
- [train rumbling]
- [horn blaring]

42:11.532 --> 42:12.950
[cell phone buzzes]

42:26.296 --> 42:28.757
[Jean]
<i>It was like that for a brief moment.</i>

42:29.299 --> 42:33.053
<i>All time had stopped,
and I was outside myself.</i>

42:34.054 --> 42:38.141
<i>I felt completely out of control,
like I couldn't see anymore,</i>

42:38.767 --> 42:44.273
<i>couldn't feel anymore,
and all I had was myself.</i>

42:45.649 --> 42:48.819
<i>If I didn't find a way
to manage my own fear,</i>

42:49.236 --> 42:55.117
<i>find a way to save myself,
no one ever would.</i>

42:56.741 --> 42:59.118
<i>The roller coaster would never stop.</i>

43:13.468 --> 43:15.220
I heard you saved the day.

43:15.304 --> 43:16.722
Something like that.

43:16.805 --> 43:17.890
Ah!

43:25.269 --> 43:27.980
[audience applauding]

43:29.315 --> 43:33.152
- [woman in audience] Aww.
- [scattered laughing]

43:37.743 --> 43:38.827
Shh.

43:39.411 --> 43:41.330
- Sweet.
- [Dolly] What's your name?

43:41.622 --> 43:46.126
Wendy Moira Angela Darling.
What is your name?

43:47.127 --> 43:49.671
- Peter Pan.
- [audience laughing]

43:50.047 --> 43:52.591
- Is that all?
- Doesn't matter.

43:52.925 --> 43:55.469
- I mean...
- What did you do to her hair?

43:56.845 --> 43:57.845
I cut it.

43:58.180 --> 43:59.723
But your mother must get letters.

44:02.226 --> 44:03.352
Don't have a mother.

44:03.432 --> 44:06.477
- [boy gasps]
- [laughing]

44:07.061 --> 44:08.688
I'm glad you think it's so funny.

44:09.274 --> 44:10.651
- [Michael] Shh.
- Stop.

44:10.734 --> 44:12.486
- [Michael] Okay.
- God, you never change.

44:12.569 --> 44:14.363
Clearly, neither do you.

44:17.199 --> 44:18.367
[audience laughing]

44:18.450 --> 44:19.618
[Nancy] Excuse me.

44:23.956 --> 44:26.291
I've lost my shadow.
Can you help me find it?

44:27.918 --> 44:31.171
Let's just try to enjoy our girl, okay?

44:44.560 --> 44:46.770
[audience laughing]

44:54.817 --> 44:57.987
[audience cheering and applauding]

45:24.433 --> 45:25.851
I love you.

45:34.526 --> 45:35.360
[Jean] Great job.

45:35.444 --> 45:37.321
- [Michael] Hey, great job!
- Where's Dolly?

45:37.404 --> 45:38.989
Oh, there she is, honey!

45:39.072 --> 45:40.240
- Sweetie!
- [Dolly] Mama!

45:40.324 --> 45:42.075
You did such a good job.

45:42.159 --> 45:43.619
You remembered all your lines.

45:43.702 --> 45:44.912
[Michael] You were amazing!

45:44.995 --> 45:45.995
[kisses]

45:46.038 --> 45:48.749
Amazing, amazing, amazing, amazing.
Look, Mom and I got you flowers.

45:48.832 --> 45:50.209
Hold on one second.

45:54.880 --> 45:56.381
[voice mail] <i>Jean, it's me, Allison.</i>

45:56.465 --> 45:59.635
<i>Please call me back. 646-555-0174.</i>

45:59.718 --> 46:02.763
<i>Please, I really need to talk to you.
Soon, please.</i>

46:02.843 --> 46:05.429
[cell phone buzzing]

46:10.229 --> 46:11.355
Oh, hey, Gary.

46:11.438 --> 46:13.941
[Gary] <i>Jean,</i>
<i>I've been trying to reach you.</i>

46:14.024 --> 46:17.027
Yeah, I was just watching Dolly's play.

46:17.110 --> 46:18.445
<i>The police just called.</i>

46:18.529 --> 46:21.907
<i>Your patient, Allison Adams,
she's been reported missing.</i>

46:23.075 --> 46:24.451
<i>Have you heard from her?</i>

46:25.744 --> 46:26.954
No, I haven't.
