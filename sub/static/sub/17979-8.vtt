02:38.778 --> 02:41.188
Did you really think it would be
that easy?

02:42.880 --> 02:44.256
Who sent you?

02:45.862 --> 02:48.464
I believe I asked you a question.

02:54.041 --> 02:56.853
That's the reveal. Oh fuck!
I love that.

02:56.888 --> 02:59.134
You've gotta stop dropping in on me
like this, Mrs. Bryant.

02:59.517 --> 03:01.765
I thought you'd be happy
to see me,

03:01.800 --> 03:03.942
Mr. Bryant.

03:12.049 --> 03:14.706
- Did you miss me?
- Always.

03:22.046 --> 03:26.442
Backlighting's great.
The backlighting works. Absolutely.

03:30.278 --> 03:33.820
Send a fucking clip to Ratner.

03:35.642 --> 03:37.486
Tell him we’ve got
the girl of his dreams...

03:37.521 --> 03:39.243
- I believe so.
- His wet dreams.

03:39.280 --> 03:42.286
And we want eight million for her.

03:43.059 --> 03:45.822
It's going up to twelve million
on the next picture.

03:45.858 --> 03:48.090
- Oh my God, guys!
- Don't change the story.

03:48.138 --> 03:49.911
This is unbelievable.
You guys are

03:50.018 --> 03:53.502
the best agents and managers ever.
I mean, this is unbelievable.

03:53.535 --> 03:56.150
I have a call into Stuff

03:56.198 --> 03:57.991
and I think we got the cover.

03:59.795 --> 04:01.020
Oh my God!

05:02.066 --> 05:04.581
Oh my God!
Look at that dog...

05:07.048 --> 05:08.552
Let's stop here.

05:14.178 --> 05:16.052
That was great.

05:27.805 --> 05:29.143
Shit!

05:29.178 --> 05:31.130
You're good.

05:33.017 --> 05:34.420
Alright. Like I was saying,

05:36.528 --> 05:40.423
I like her. I do. I like her.
But she's different.

05:40.468 --> 05:42.521
It’s called heterosexuality.

05:42.568 --> 05:44.901
Yeah, I know, I know.
I've been with tons

05:44.938 --> 05:47.172
of straight girls.
I know what they're like.

05:47.217 --> 05:51.232
- Tons, I tell you.
- Yeah, but maybe she’s a spaghetti girl...

05:53.777 --> 05:56.151
Straight until wet.

05:56.196 --> 05:57.352
It's horrible.

05:59.356 --> 06:01.550
Okay.
Do you think she’s into you?

06:02.618 --> 06:03.922
I don't know.

06:03.958 --> 06:06.123
I called... Wait.
I called her the other day,

06:06.166 --> 06:09.233
and we're talking,
and her boyfriend's on the other line.

06:09.265 --> 06:11.191
- Oh, straight girl is playing you.
- Yeah. I...

06:11.995 --> 06:13.512
I know, I know, I know. But

06:13.548 --> 06:15.211
I like it.

06:15.246 --> 06:17.223
That's the crazy. I like it.

06:18.855 --> 06:20.261
I'm thinking...

06:20.848 --> 06:23.523
I should take her somewhere.
I don't know. I was thinking,

06:23.555 --> 06:26.943
I was thinking maybe I should,
I should take her to the theater.

06:27.786 --> 06:30.413
- Does she like the theater?
- I don’t know...

06:30.458 --> 06:32.031
I hate it.

06:32.068 --> 06:34.033
Forget this thing.

06:34.066 --> 06:37.111
- It sounds horrible.
- Forget this kinda thing.

06:38.335 --> 06:40.772
Hey, how about if I have a dinner party?

06:41.198 --> 06:43.071
- Really?
- In my house.

06:43.546 --> 06:46.080
- Yeah.
- So uh...

06:46.957 --> 06:48.982
But only one more couple.

06:49.015 --> 06:50.750
Okay. Uh...

06:50.796 --> 06:51.992
I don't know who.

06:52.025 --> 06:54.601
- Oh, Sam and Tina.
- Sam?

06:54.637 --> 06:56.900
Yeah, Sam the DP on the movie.

06:56.945 --> 06:58.403
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah?

06:58.437 --> 07:00.461
- Yeah.
- Alright.

07:02.508 --> 07:04.423
- Do we roll?
- Wait,

07:04.458 --> 07:06.433
it's one time, like this.

07:07.038 --> 07:09.682
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, almost.

07:09.725 --> 07:13.442
Is Bette... Wait, is Bette pressuring you
to do this super bike ride?

07:13.485 --> 07:15.812
- No, no, I wanna ride.
- Yeah?

07:15.856 --> 07:18.542
My Aunt is a breast cancer survivor...

07:19.067 --> 07:20.991
That's a good reason. Okay.

07:23.868 --> 07:26.312
"Is Niki a Lez Girl"?!
Have you seen this?

07:26.356 --> 07:28.092
- Oh, shit.
- She has

07:28.127 --> 07:31.603
a hundred million dollar career-making
blockbuster premiering tomorrow night,

07:31.637 --> 07:33.853
and all anyone wants to talk about
this morning

07:33.887 --> 07:36.733
is what she’s doing in your
little turd of a movie.

07:36.768 --> 07:38.783
Look, Kevin,
it's not good for our movie either.

07:38.825 --> 07:40.560
- I’m gonna fuckin’ pull her.
- No!

07:40.595 --> 07:43.280
The last thing I need is
the zit faced teen boy demographic

07:43.325 --> 07:45.270
thinking Niki Stevens doesn't like dick!

07:45.316 --> 07:46.561
I mean, I never wanted her to do

07:46.567 --> 07:48.410
- "Lez Girls".
- Kevin, you can't pull her, okay?

07:48.447 --> 07:50.493
We're in the middle of production, alright?

07:50.535 --> 07:52.913
Please, you can't pull her
from the movie.

07:52.945 --> 07:55.770
Just wait. Hear me out.
Look, I have an idea.

07:56.765 --> 07:59.743
Do you represent any hot young actors?

07:59.787 --> 08:01.883
Yeah. I’m on the verge with Zac Efron.

08:01.925 --> 08:04.612
No, no, no. We need her

08:04.656 --> 08:08.633
to be photographed at her premiere
with someone

08:08.676 --> 08:11.953
hip and hot and hunky,

08:11.995 --> 08:14.981
handsome.
You know, someone

08:15.027 --> 08:17.803
- whose dick she might like.
- Oh, Tina,

08:17.835 --> 08:21.113
oh, Tina, that's fucking brilliant!

08:21.146 --> 08:23.072
- Yeah.
- I got

08:23.106 --> 08:26.111
call asking about her the other day,
from Stavros Niarchos...

08:26.147 --> 08:28.992
No, no, no, we can do better than that.

08:29.035 --> 08:30.771
He's jeezy. I mean,

08:30.807 --> 08:34.650
there's no way that Niki Stevens
dates Paris's sloppy seconds.

08:34.726 --> 08:37.332
Niki is an actress,
she's not a fucking heiress.

08:38.077 --> 08:40.210
Somebody who's

08:40.976 --> 08:44.169
really boyishly hip and

08:44.174 --> 08:46.490
and High-School Musical
Jane Magazine sort of way?

08:46.535 --> 08:48.721
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You know,

08:48.755 --> 08:52.150
yeah, you know, someone sensitive,
someone who all the tweenish girls

08:52.186 --> 08:54.033
just go really nuts for.

08:55.367 --> 08:58.881
Hey, boss. Are you ready to take
a look at my outfit for the scene with...

08:59.985 --> 09:02.913
Oh, shit time for busting in on you.

09:02.956 --> 09:05.690
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Uh, Greg, this is Kevin.

09:05.725 --> 09:07.740
This is Niki's manager

09:07.785 --> 09:10.803
and jeans are great. I'm sure
Jenny will be happy with those.

09:10.835 --> 09:12.102
It's gonna work.

09:14.047 --> 09:15.293
Good to meet you.

09:17.406 --> 09:19.652
- How about I catch on you later?
- Okay. Thanks, Greg.

09:22.517 --> 09:23.640
I'd fuck him.

09:26.055 --> 09:28.542
A dick that everybody likes.

09:29.915 --> 09:32.501
- "The Blister Exists" by Slipknot -

09:54.355 --> 09:55.991
Are you done with that?

09:57.827 --> 09:59.391
Yeah,

10:00.015 --> 10:01.761
it's all yours.

10:21.056 --> 10:22.783
Who's that for, Jesse?

10:23.306 --> 10:25.991
Stuff here...
Why is she wearing a Balenciaga?

10:26.025 --> 10:28.581
- She can't afford that.
- 'Cause she saw Balenciaga

10:28.615 --> 10:30.920
in Karina’s closet and went nuts...

10:30.958 --> 10:32.843
Why does she always get
the good clothes...?!

10:32.888 --> 10:34.910
Wait, who said that? Jesse?

10:35.735 --> 10:38.453
Why can't I wear the furskin
Mark Jacobs boots!

10:38.538 --> 10:40.841
I want Balenciaga!
She totally lost it on me,

10:40.875 --> 10:42.913
stomping and screaming around...

10:42.948 --> 10:45.153
- So what did you say?
- I got her one.

10:46.526 --> 10:49.490
Alright. Well, don't worry, Gloria.
I think you did the right thing.

10:49.537 --> 10:51.523
I'm gonna talk to her.
She'll be fine.

10:51.556 --> 10:52.912
- Hey.
- There you are. Look, Jenny,

10:52.956 --> 10:54.343
I need to talk to you.

10:54.375 --> 10:57.582
I just need to finish my meeting, okay?

10:57.708 --> 11:00.290
Give me a second.
Can I see the Marni?

11:01.615 --> 11:06.081
There she is! Hello!
Oh, my godness, I love it.

11:06.118 --> 11:08.372
I love it, love it, love it.
This is for Karina?

11:08.415 --> 11:09.391
Yes.

11:11.016 --> 11:13.412
I think that this purple...

11:13.457 --> 11:15.490
- Isn't this purple fabulous?
- It's amazing. I love it.

11:15.537 --> 11:18.042
It's amazing. It is.
You know what I think?

11:18.085 --> 11:20.851
I think that this should be
Karina's colour and I sort of,

11:20.885 --> 11:22.712
I see her with this

11:22.747 --> 11:26.330
gold choker that's here
up the neck like that,

11:26.377 --> 11:27.620
that like,

11:27.655 --> 11:30.481
it's like the snake is intertwined.

11:30.525 --> 11:33.403
Now, Jenny.
I need to talk to you right now.

11:33.446 --> 11:37.121
You have to hang on.
I'm not done with my meeting.

11:37.166 --> 11:42.220
I also see her with a fresh gardenia
in her hair

11:42.252 --> 11:46.226
so she just walks into the room
and she's just like wafting feminity.

11:46.261 --> 11:48.213
- I think that would... What?
- This is important.

11:48.250 --> 11:50.496
Okay. Mom is calling.

11:52.989 --> 11:54.420
Listen,

11:55.346 --> 11:58.160
we have a bit of a
situation with Niki’s managers.

11:58.217 --> 12:01.310
- What's going on?
- It's about the SheBar debacle last week.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.472
There are photos all over

12:03.506 --> 12:05.041
- the tabloids of her.
- I know.

12:05.076 --> 12:07.993
- I saw it and it's terrible.
- No, it's fucking awful

12:08.036 --> 12:11.803
and her management, they're
beside themselves. They're so angry.

12:12.076 --> 12:14.162
They're gonna pull her from our movie.

12:14.177 --> 12:17.361
What? Come on!
They can't do that.

12:17.428 --> 12:18.920
- Yes, they can.
- Why?

12:18.986 --> 12:23.202
Because these photos
were taken on our time clock. Okay?

12:23.247 --> 12:26.112
And it was a total breach
of her contract.

12:26.157 --> 12:28.570
You know, luckily for us,

12:28.607 --> 12:31.873
I don’t think they will do that
because it wouldn’t look good for Niki.

12:33.258 --> 12:35.373
But they’re insisting,

12:35.407 --> 12:40.401
insisting, that she take a date
to the Liquid Heat premiere tomorrow.

12:40.466 --> 12:43.162
Oh, she is. She’s taking me.

12:43.207 --> 12:45.971
Not unless you grow a penis.

12:46.006 --> 12:48.212
- What?
- A jock.

12:48.257 --> 12:52.892
A standard, cute,
girls-creaming-in their-jeans American hunk.

12:52.938 --> 12:54.700
- No.
- Actor boy.

12:54.746 --> 12:56.313
- What?
- Yeah, that's what they want.

12:56.355 --> 12:58.882
No, you're kidding.
I don't believe you.

13:02.948 --> 13:04.293
Hey,

13:04.857 --> 13:06.683
what's going on?

13:06.715 --> 13:10.060
I just heard that you're taking some
actor to the premiere tomorrow night

13:10.107 --> 13:12.723
- instead of me. Is that true?
- I don't want to.

13:12.765 --> 13:15.412
I don't want to,
but they're making me.

13:16.545 --> 13:20.093
They said that if I, if I went without,
without some boy,

13:20.168 --> 13:23.240
that everybody would say I was gay
and people would not like me anymore.

13:23.286 --> 13:25.603
And then my career would be over.

13:27.076 --> 13:29.081
And they're just making me date
fucking Greg,

13:29.125 --> 13:31.772
they're making me date cheese-ball Greg!

13:31.817 --> 13:35.100
The Greg who plays Tim in the fucking film?

13:35.136 --> 13:36.781
- Yeah.
- That midget?

13:36.828 --> 13:39.280
No! Whose fucking idea is this?

13:39.375 --> 13:42.280
I don't want to.
I wanna go with you so bad.

13:42.316 --> 13:45.461
- Well, I wanna go with you.
- That's outta the question.

13:45.495 --> 13:49.053
I don’t want you within ten miles of
the Westwood Palace tomorrow night.

13:49.088 --> 13:51.730
You know what, Kevin?
I don't really care

13:51.738 --> 13:55.493
what you and your fucking purple tie
think of my whereabouts, okay?

13:55.527 --> 13:57.623
What the fuck do you think this is?
1952?

13:57.665 --> 14:00.341
Well, you can give her a beard
so you can pretend that she's straight?

14:00.387 --> 14:02.410
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
- No, actually,

14:02.456 --> 14:05.803
- you should be ashamed of yourself.
- Oh yeah? Why?

14:07.045 --> 14:10.402
I'm not even gonna go into
the questionable ethics of you

14:10.447 --> 14:13.082
screwing the under-age star
of your movie.

14:13.125 --> 14:17.450
- I love her, Kevin! I do!
- But if you so deeply care for Niki

14:17.487 --> 14:22.873
and your purported mission to make
the first star-driven, studio movie about lesbians,

14:24.457 --> 14:27.520
you're not gonna destroy
the career of the star

14:27.547 --> 14:29.512
on whom the movie’s success hinges.

14:29.558 --> 14:32.982
I will not continue this conversation

14:33.025 --> 14:36.741
until you remove the piece of snot
that's dangling from your nose.

14:37.745 --> 14:40.683
- You're so quick.
- No, I'm actually serious.

14:40.727 --> 14:44.770
It's distracting the seriousness
of your arguments. So...

14:44.818 --> 14:46.702
take the tissue,

14:46.745 --> 14:48.782
- and just wipe your nose.
- Thanks.

14:50.815 --> 14:53.400
You don't have to listen to
the things he says.

14:53.448 --> 14:55.583
He's not even a human being.

14:55.618 --> 14:57.072
He's an agent.

14:57.586 --> 14:59.461
Cover that hickey.

14:59.505 --> 15:01.233
Change your fucking tie.

15:41.797 --> 15:45.223
Hey, what are you still doing here?
I thought you were wrapped.

15:48.506 --> 15:50.903
I want to get drunk

15:53.638 --> 15:55.162
and then

15:56.046 --> 15:58.213
I want you
to have sex with me.

16:00.307 --> 16:04.951
Cammie, let's not forget. You're not gay.
You're just gay for pay, right?

16:04.996 --> 16:07.852
- I know that. I suck in this part.
- No, you don't.

16:07.858 --> 16:09.513
- No, I do, I know I do.
- No.

16:09.556 --> 16:10.673
- Jenny hates me.
- -She doesn't.

16:10.706 --> 16:13.451
- She wishes she never cast me. I know she does.
- She's my friend, she'd never say that.

16:13.495 --> 16:15.573
- And I'm a good actor. It's not fair.
- I know you are.

16:15.617 --> 16:17.233
You're doing a wonderful...

16:20.177 --> 16:22.253
- Cammie?
- What?

16:22.287 --> 16:25.670
- This isn't professional.
- You sleep with everyone!

16:25.705 --> 16:27.902
- Wait a second! Who told you that?
- You...

16:27.946 --> 16:31.083
It's me. Am I that repulsive?

16:31.127 --> 16:33.011
No! You're beautiful.

16:34.338 --> 16:35.813
You are...

16:36.928 --> 16:38.400
Shane, I wanted to...

16:38.405 --> 16:40.613
- "Underworld" by BETTY -

16:41.307 --> 16:43.850
That's a great colour on you.
Could you give us a second?

16:45.567 --> 16:47.322
One moment.

16:47.368 --> 16:49.483
- Okay, I'm gonna talk to her.
- Okay.

16:49.516 --> 16:51.773
- And it's not gonna leave the three of us, alright?
- Thank you.

16:51.817 --> 16:54.650
Get now... just get dressed and

16:54.686 --> 16:56.150
and go home.

17:05.036 --> 17:06.781
Is this all for tomorrow night?

17:06.817 --> 17:08.231
Yeah. I'm doing Moroccan.

17:09.007 --> 17:10.673
Yeah, I see that.

17:12.045 --> 17:15.433
And uh, who's coming to this Moroccan feast?

17:15.468 --> 17:18.792
Amy and her new girlfriend Melinda.

17:20.056 --> 17:23.443
- Shane, maybe Molly.
- Shane and Molly?

17:23.474 --> 17:26.073
It's such a disaster.

17:27.048 --> 17:28.501
Well...

17:32.648 --> 17:34.310
A little flaky,

17:34.347 --> 17:38.550
and a little homophobic. I mean,
the things that she said about Phyllis...

17:47.556 --> 17:49.532
I think that's right.
She's so crazy about her.

17:49.567 --> 17:51.650
She loves the challenge.

17:51.696 --> 17:54.722
- It's not about that.
- Yeah, so she says.

17:54.757 --> 17:57.751
And I, I invited Tina and Sam.

18:00.505 --> 18:02.023
You what?

18:02.066 --> 18:05.910
- Shane said they're together.
- They're not together.

18:07.037 --> 18:09.911
It doesn't matter.
It's not a couple diner.

18:12.508 --> 18:15.612
Anyway, Tina seemed happy
to bring her.

18:17.167 --> 18:18.623
Did it uh...

18:19.016 --> 18:21.503
Did it ever occur to you to maybe

18:21.548 --> 18:24.390
ask me first before you

18:24.428 --> 18:26.322
invited Tina and...?

18:27.228 --> 18:28.830
No.

18:31.387 --> 18:33.970
What... what are you so upsed about?

18:37.536 --> 18:40.531
I don't know. I mean, I just,
I think it's uh...

18:41.827 --> 18:45.483
Just this whole ex-girlfriend
becoming best friend thing.

18:45.525 --> 18:48.833
I mean, it's you and your ex,
me and my ex. It’s really my idea

18:48.876 --> 18:52.472
of some kind of nightmare
lesbian dinner party.

18:56.075 --> 18:57.851
Then don't come!

18:59.035 --> 19:00.602
But let me know.

19:05.875 --> 19:07.403
Of course I'm coming.

19:11.568 --> 19:13.092
Can I help you?

19:21.027 --> 19:23.010
You're very bad.

19:23.045 --> 19:26.280
- "What's Going On" by Marvin Gaye -

20:47.037 --> 20:49.341
- Hello, Alice.
- Hi.

20:49.378 --> 20:51.480
Thank you very much for joining us today.

20:51.528 --> 20:53.363
The proceedings will be begin shortly.

20:53.406 --> 20:55.760
You can wait here
until you're called to testify.

20:55.796 --> 20:57.191
All we ask of you is that

20:57.268 --> 21:00.873
you answer any question posed
directly and truthfully.

21:00.908 --> 21:03.963
I'll try not to take too much of your time.

21:09.508 --> 21:11.762
This Board has been convened
for the purpose

21:11.848 --> 21:16.571
of considering the pertinent facts relating
to the case of Captain Tasha Williams,

21:16.605 --> 21:18.951
542nd Military Police Company,

21:18.995 --> 21:21.902
who is being processed for
administrative separation by reason

21:21.938 --> 21:23.971
of homosexual conduct

21:24.005 --> 21:27.901
under the provisions of AR 135-175,

21:27.937 --> 21:30.882
paragraph 2-12g.

21:30.917 --> 21:35.653
The Board will make a recommendation
with respect to final action of retention,

21:35.686 --> 21:37.792
separation or suspension.

21:37.797 --> 21:41.363
The Board is not bound
by any formal rules of evidence.

21:41.698 --> 21:45.891
And the Board’s decision will be based upon
a preponderance of the evidence presented.

21:46.508 --> 21:48.711
Captain Williams, do you have any questions

21:48.757 --> 21:51.272
regarding your rights or
procedures before this Board?

21:52.346 --> 21:53.682
No, Sir.

21:53.685 --> 21:57.270
Captain Tasha Williams is
an exemplary soldier.

21:57.345 --> 21:59.773
She has served
with distinction in Iraq.

21:59.816 --> 22:02.872
She has a Bronze Star Medal
with V for Valor,

22:02.877 --> 22:04.952
two Army Commendation Medals,

22:04.987 --> 22:08.832
a Joint Service Commendation Medal...
There can be no debating

22:08.877 --> 22:11.083
Captain Williams's courage

22:11.116 --> 22:13.440
and commitment to military service.

22:14.445 --> 22:15.800
Thank you.

22:19.018 --> 22:22.663
The military code of conduct
is very clear.

22:22.697 --> 22:26.272
Rules are in place to maintain
good order and discipline,

22:26.307 --> 22:30.162
and our job here
is to enforce those rules.

22:30.208 --> 22:32.421
It has been alleged
that Captain Williams

22:32.477 --> 22:35.223
has committed
acts of homosexual conduct,

22:35.258 --> 22:39.721
and should the evidence presented to you
today support those findings,

22:39.866 --> 22:42.201
the government will recommend
that Captain Williams

22:42.248 --> 22:46.043
be separated from duty in
the United States Army National Guard.

22:46.515 --> 22:47.763
Thank you.

22:47.808 --> 22:49.503
- "I'm A Lover" by The Staple Singers -

22:49.538 --> 22:52.110
Oh, well, check out this shit.

22:54.438 --> 22:57.712
Yeah. What the fuck am I gonna do
with these She-bitches?

22:59.376 --> 23:01.343
You got them closed down.
What else do you want?

23:01.488 --> 23:04.491
Yeah, but they're gonna open back
and when they do,

23:04.608 --> 23:06.290
guess what? Everybody’s gonna
want to go over there

23:06.346 --> 23:09.013
wanting to look at that Niki Stevens
and her greasy ass.

23:09.115 --> 23:11.332
So, go pull a Tony Soprano
and get them whacked.

23:11.408 --> 23:12.522
Oh shit!

23:14.088 --> 23:16.242
Have you lost your mind?

23:16.257 --> 23:19.863
You can’t take a hiatus from school!
You aced your LSAT’s.

23:19.898 --> 23:23.183
I'm just taking some time off
to figure out what exactly I want to do.

23:23.898 --> 23:27.061
I mean, why does the world need
more lawyers, seriously?

23:27.096 --> 23:29.490
What’s the point? It’s so pedestrian.
You get a degree

23:29.535 --> 23:32.092
- and then intern...
- For Ruth Bader Ginsburg!

23:32.126 --> 23:33.223
Who ever!

23:33.238 --> 23:36.222
Then you get married
and pop out 2.5 babies

23:36.275 --> 23:38.122
- and summer on the Cape.
- Yes!

23:38.157 --> 23:40.221
No! I don’t want that life!

23:40.296 --> 23:42.560
- It’s just not me!
- It is you! It’s always been you.

23:42.658 --> 23:44.653
What about Richard?
Richard loves you!

23:44.666 --> 23:46.533
Richard was a bore.

23:46.616 --> 23:48.540
It's why we broke up last week.

23:48.627 --> 23:51.530
- He worshipped the ground you walked on!
- Which was boring!

23:51.558 --> 23:54.051
He’s learning to golf, Mom, golf.

23:54.087 --> 23:57.481
And he's got medication
for early-onset baldness!

23:57.536 --> 24:00.561
- Don’t you see how depressing that is?
- He's human.

24:00.657 --> 24:03.700
You can’t throw away everything
you two have built together.

24:03.706 --> 24:05.241
You’re one to talk.

24:06.557 --> 24:08.243
What does your father say?

24:08.286 --> 24:10.571
That you owe him a lot of money
and you’ve ruined his life.

24:10.608 --> 24:13.963
Do you know what happens to people
without an education?

24:14.056 --> 24:15.241
You could end up like...

24:17.076 --> 24:18.383
Like her!

24:20.875 --> 24:22.940
- What’s wrong with Shane?
- She's a hairdresser!

24:22.976 --> 24:25.333
That’s what happens to people
who don’t get an education.

24:25.365 --> 24:27.133
They wind up in service professions.

24:27.165 --> 24:29.133
Did you just hear yourself say that?

24:29.178 --> 24:31.422
- You're so elitist.
- It’s true!

24:31.467 --> 24:34.201
- I thought you were friend with Shane.
- Sure, to party with.

24:34.236 --> 24:36.550
- To party with?!
- Molly...

24:36.586 --> 24:39.480
She’s not a serious person.

24:39.515 --> 24:41.710
What do you know about her?
You don’t know her at all.

24:41.755 --> 24:43.342
I know plenty. She’s a

24:43.377 --> 24:45.132
Lothario and a cad,

24:45.227 --> 24:47.251
and the kind of boy
you fall in love with in high school

24:47.266 --> 24:49.751
before you know any better.
Thank god you’re not a lesbian.

24:49.788 --> 24:51.361
Where are you going?

24:51.408 --> 24:52.690
Go gay for Shane.

24:52.727 --> 24:55.343
We’re gonna adopt Chinese babies
and live in a trailer park.

24:55.385 --> 24:57.973
Don’t you dare tell her
anything I just said.

25:09.068 --> 25:11.620
Oh my God, you're alive!
Hi!

25:11.655 --> 25:13.703
I'm sorry I didn't call you back.

25:14.557 --> 25:15.702
I called you?

25:16.567 --> 25:19.232
Listen, I might have called you,
but it was a long time ago. So,

25:19.287 --> 25:21.283
Alzheimer's kicked in at some point.

25:22.055 --> 25:23.482
Am I seeing you tonight?

25:24.405 --> 25:27.682
If you're seeing me tonight...
You might seeing me tonight. Maybe.

25:27.716 --> 25:30.172
- Maybe.
- Maybe. How about this? How about

25:30.215 --> 25:32.883
you call me in a little bit
and we talk about it.

25:34.227 --> 25:36.900
- I will.
- I won't hold my breath, but,

25:36.936 --> 25:39.120
I look forward to hearing
the phone ring.

25:43.518 --> 25:45.272
Earlier you testified that Captain Williams

25:45.318 --> 25:47.080
was your commanding officer in Iraq.

25:47.187 --> 25:49.623
Would you please characterize her
as a commanding officer?

25:49.655 --> 25:53.103
She’s a fair and honest leader.
She has the respect of her unit

25:53.148 --> 25:55.520
and always has a clear picture of
where we’re going.

25:55.558 --> 25:58.352
We got into some
pretty hairy situations out there,

25:58.415 --> 26:00.490
but we always felt safe
with Captain Williams,

26:00.527 --> 26:02.771
as safe as you can
in that part of the world, Sir.

26:02.806 --> 26:03.912
Good.

26:03.945 --> 26:06.181
Do you have any personal knowledge

26:06.216 --> 26:09.181
supporting the allegations that
Captain Williams is a homosexual?

26:09.525 --> 26:10.871
No, Sir.

26:10.905 --> 26:12.370
I see.

26:12.415 --> 26:15.731
You testified that
you’ve been reclassified MOS 42A

26:15.768 --> 26:17.942
and transferred to a another division.

26:17.988 --> 26:19.870
What was
Captain Williams’ role in that?

26:19.917 --> 26:22.860
I asked Captain Williams to
recommend me for job reclassification

26:22.905 --> 26:26.352
because of personal circumstances
having to do with my family, Sir.

26:26.385 --> 26:28.271
So she went to bat for you?

26:28.308 --> 26:29.601
Yes, Sir.

26:29.638 --> 26:30.652
I see.

26:30.698 --> 26:33.303
And you would have no qualms about
serving under her again, would you?

26:33.335 --> 26:35.321
I would serve under her anytime, Sir.

26:35.367 --> 26:36.441
Thanks.

26:40.437 --> 26:41.893
You could have said no.

26:41.925 --> 26:43.821
You didn’t have to accept the invitation.

26:43.868 --> 26:46.090
I thought it was coming
from both of you.

26:46.177 --> 26:47.620
Why would I invite you to bring some

26:47.655 --> 26:49.563
girl who’s after you
to Jodi’s dinner party?

26:49.605 --> 26:51.651
I don’t know. I thought it was
something you decided. You know,

26:51.685 --> 26:53.532
you're the one that's with Jodi.

26:53.546 --> 26:54.881
I'm with

26:54.925 --> 26:57.131
whoever the fuck I'm with.
No one.

26:57.165 --> 26:59.052
And you and I are just...

26:59.098 --> 27:01.652
we just have some kind of flameless?

27:01.696 --> 27:03.622
And you're okay with that?

27:03.656 --> 27:06.322
It’s kind of a foregone conclusion,
don’t you think?

27:06.365 --> 27:08.741
No. No, it's not. Not for me.

27:13.596 --> 27:16.241
I don't want to break
you and Jodi.

27:17.198 --> 27:20.662
That's not anything I want.
I don't wanna be part of that. I...

27:21.238 --> 27:23.031
What if I want to?

27:24.007 --> 27:25.352
Do you?

27:27.086 --> 27:28.642
Look, I really, I don't...

27:30.967 --> 27:34.821
This is just I don't like
who I am becoming right now and...

27:35.856 --> 27:37.470
and when I

27:37.507 --> 27:39.750
think about Angie, it's just...

27:39.758 --> 27:41.513
it, it's just...

27:41.546 --> 27:44.021
not behavior I want to model
for our daughter.

27:49.317 --> 27:50.840
What do you wanna do?

27:57.567 --> 27:59.812
I think we should stop,

27:59.858 --> 28:01.381
you know,

28:01.888 --> 28:05.401
but I just think we should get
some kind of clarity for us. I just...

28:07.598 --> 28:09.771
It's a good idea, yeah.

28:16.036 --> 28:20.012
Thank you for your testimony here today,
Specialist Martinez.

28:20.057 --> 28:23.272
I just have a few more questions
for clarification.

28:23.305 --> 28:26.610
This job reclassification,

28:26.648 --> 28:30.483
you said it was something
that Captain Williams arranged for you?

28:30.526 --> 28:33.931
- Yes, Ma’am.
- That’s very fortunate for you.

28:33.968 --> 28:36.673
Not many reclassification requests
are granted.

28:36.715 --> 28:39.810
The military doesn’t usually like
to spend the time and money

28:39.856 --> 28:42.121
to retrain somebody for
someone else’s job

28:42.125 --> 28:44.141
when they’re perfectly capable
of doing the one

28:44.146 --> 28:46.041
to which they’ve already been assigned.

28:46.076 --> 28:49.112
Captain Williams must have felt
very strongly about you

28:49.145 --> 28:50.873
to have granted that request.

28:51.278 --> 28:52.790
I don’t know, Ma'am.

28:52.826 --> 28:55.473
Did you have a sexual relationship
with Captain Williams?

28:55.515 --> 28:57.770
- No, Ma'am.
- What sort of relationship did you have?

28:57.818 --> 28:59.973
She was my commanding officer, Ma'am.

29:00.658 --> 29:03.683
Did she ever take you out to dinner?

29:03.725 --> 29:05.810
- No.
- Put your arm around you?

29:06.988 --> 29:09.182
- Well, sure but...
- Isn’t it true that when

29:09.215 --> 29:12.240
she put her arm around you,
you knew she was a lesbian?

29:12.276 --> 29:13.681
No. I mean,

29:13.716 --> 29:16.751
- I had heard rumors.
- What kind of rumors?

29:17.336 --> 29:19.161
Some of the guys, they talk...

29:19.215 --> 29:21.391
It was generally believed, in your unit,

29:21.396 --> 29:24.751
that Captain Williams was a lesbian.
Yes?

29:24.766 --> 29:28.830
- Some of the guys, they...
- Specialist Martinez, yes or no.

29:28.875 --> 29:31.930
- Yes, Ma'am.
- In that case, you must have felt

29:31.965 --> 29:34.910
uncomfortable to be receiving
special treatment

29:34.947 --> 29:36.803
from Captain Williams?

29:36.837 --> 29:40.372
I mean, if she was a lesbian and
you were receiving preferential treatment...

29:40.417 --> 29:44.171
Objection. Characterization of
preferential treatment is unsupported.

29:44.216 --> 29:45.691
Objection overruled.

29:45.737 --> 29:47.143
Witness may answer.

29:48.076 --> 29:52.572
Did you feel uncomfortable
receiving attention from Captain Williams?

29:56.515 --> 29:58.993
I didn’t want the others thinking I was...

30:02.018 --> 30:03.813
Yes.

30:03.846 --> 30:05.493
I was uncomfortable.

30:20.616 --> 30:22.382
How’s it going?

30:23.627 --> 30:25.342
Martinez folded.

30:27.065 --> 30:28.983
I’m sorry. It's...

30:29.906 --> 30:31.840
Do you know
when they’re gonna call me?

30:31.848 --> 30:34.680
You’re their witness.
I have no idea.

30:34.687 --> 30:37.311
Tasha, I’m not on her side.
I don’t want to be here.

30:37.386 --> 30:38.420
I know.

30:39.415 --> 30:41.720
I’m just sorry that
you got pulled into this.

30:47.096 --> 30:50.423
It’s okay.
You can talk to one another.

30:50.468 --> 30:52.700
I was looking for you.

30:52.737 --> 30:54.482
Well, you found me.

30:54.516 --> 30:56.683
I came to tell you
that we’re out of time.

30:56.716 --> 30:58.901
You mean, I don’t have to testify?

30:58.945 --> 31:00.891
Same time tomorrow.

31:21.017 --> 31:23.893
Niki, you look beautiful.

31:25.607 --> 31:27.961
Niki, do the smile.

31:42.985 --> 31:45.053
Adele, there she is.

31:45.098 --> 31:48.570
- Oh my God, she looks so beautiful.
- She looks amazing.

31:48.616 --> 31:51.512
You see that woman over there
in the blue dress?

31:52.576 --> 31:55.222
She's banned. Meke sure
she doesn't get into that theater.

31:55.255 --> 31:56.513
Got it?

31:56.545 --> 31:57.771
Yeah, I'll take care of it.

32:00.005 --> 32:01.811
- "Maresia" by Monica Freire -

32:04.197 --> 32:07.201
- Hi!
- Hi Jodi, how are you? Sorry we're late.

32:07.248 --> 32:09.772
I had a meeting
to go over the next week’s work.

32:11.118 --> 32:14.862
- Do you want something to drink?
- Uh... wine would be great.

32:14.906 --> 32:17.371
Uh, no, thank you.
I don't drink when I'm shooting.

32:17.418 --> 32:19.371
I’d think you would need a stiff drink

32:19.418 --> 32:22.850
after being mired in
Jenny’s masturbatory opus all day long.

32:26.087 --> 32:28.843
Uh, this is Amy and Melinda.
This is

32:28.886 --> 32:31.853
Tina and this is Sam.

32:31.897 --> 32:33.083
This is Molly.

32:38.345 --> 32:39.902
Hi, what's up?

32:43.476 --> 32:45.391
- Excuse me, Miss.
- Yes?

32:45.436 --> 32:47.833
I’m going to have
to ask you to leave the premises.

32:49.155 --> 32:52.121
Well, excuse me, Mister,

32:52.158 --> 32:53.732
but I actually

32:53.766 --> 32:55.643
have a ticket.

32:55.677 --> 32:57.691
Excuse me!

33:02.565 --> 33:04.131
Just text her.

33:05.015 --> 33:06.591
I don't like you.

33:07.927 --> 33:09.911
It will just take one second, okay?

33:23.375 --> 33:25.801
She's not gonna get that.
You've gotta go in there

33:25.845 --> 33:28.262
- and tell her we're here.
- I'm gonna go inside, I'm gonna tell her.

33:28.308 --> 33:30.700
She's gonna insist that they let you in.
This is a huge

33:30.735 --> 33:32.982
- dumb mistake. Okay?
- Yeah.

33:33.016 --> 33:35.070
- Two seconds.
- I feel like an asshole, but...

33:35.157 --> 33:36.202
Don't!

33:52.327 --> 33:55.523
So you’re the cameraman
for Jenny’s movie?

33:55.557 --> 33:57.990
Oh, the Director of Photography. Yeah.

33:58.025 --> 34:02.112
That must be pretty unusual,
to have a woman doing that job.

34:02.146 --> 34:05.230
There are about
as many female DPs in Hollywood

34:05.236 --> 34:07.232
as there are women in Congress.

34:07.266 --> 34:08.841
We were lucky to get Sam.

34:11.087 --> 34:13.201
Yes, Richard is a really nice guy,

34:13.235 --> 34:15.351
and he loves me so much,
but

34:15.388 --> 34:17.092
it's just not enough.

34:17.098 --> 34:18.661
The problem is, I just...

34:18.706 --> 34:22.962
don't give the shit how much he loves me.
I mean, we don't have that

34:23.005 --> 34:25.271
thing, you know, the...

34:25.777 --> 34:28.000
- Zsuss.
- Right.

34:28.036 --> 34:30.322
No zsuss, no spark, no

34:31.565 --> 34:33.842
- thing.
- Got it.

34:35.547 --> 34:37.202
Do you want a cigarette?

34:37.245 --> 34:40.322
- I'm trying to quit.
- Yeah, me too.

34:40.356 --> 34:42.942
- But I can quit tomorrow.
- Me too.

35:09.597 --> 35:11.520
This is delicious.

35:11.566 --> 35:13.082
What it's called?

35:14.775 --> 35:18.360
B-I-S-T-E-Y-A.

35:19.398 --> 35:21.102
This is bisteya.

35:21.808 --> 35:23.553
And you made it? It's amazing.

35:23.587 --> 35:26.221
I’m sorry.
We didn’t mean to exclude you.

35:26.256 --> 35:29.012
- Yes, you did.
- No, we didn't.

35:29.046 --> 35:30.612
- Yes, she did.
- Uh, what did you say?

35:30.645 --> 35:32.851
Nothing.

35:33.956 --> 35:35.520
Where’s the bathroom?

35:44.566 --> 35:48.031
Has Jodi ever made you an Indian dinner?

35:48.067 --> 35:49.443
No.

35:50.027 --> 35:51.921
Too bad.

35:52.435 --> 35:56.442
Well, it’s just as well
because Bette hates Indian food.

35:57.045 --> 35:59.072
Well, I didn’t before we...

35:59.688 --> 36:01.662
we went to India and

36:01.686 --> 36:03.413
I got really sick there.

36:04.147 --> 36:07.130
Yeah. She lost ten pounds.

36:07.168 --> 36:10.322
She was so weak, I practically
had to carry her through Jaipur.

36:16.066 --> 36:18.211
- I know your deal.
- No, you don't.

36:18.258 --> 36:22.031
I do. You're thinking:
"Here's this stupid little straight girl

36:22.075 --> 36:25.141
who doesn't know who she is or
what she wants to do with her life"

36:25.245 --> 36:27.580
and you’re just going to sit there
and be charming until I sleep with you.

36:28.218 --> 36:30.193
I think nothing of the sort.

36:31.227 --> 36:32.860
- Really?
- Really.

36:32.905 --> 36:34.570
You don't want to sleep with me.

36:36.086 --> 36:38.131
- No.
- Why not?!

36:39.068 --> 36:42.103
Jesus God! Um...

36:42.508 --> 36:44.670
Well, to be honest,
I thought about it.

36:44.708 --> 36:47.071
But I came to the conclusion that

36:47.076 --> 36:50.722
if it was to happen, you would probably
freak out afterwards and then you'd

36:50.756 --> 36:54.261
most like go running back
to your boyfriend for months.

36:54.305 --> 36:56.851
And then I'd be stuck in the cold with

36:58.558 --> 37:01.020
nothing but the distant memory of

37:01.066 --> 37:03.751
mediocre sex. And I'd

37:03.798 --> 37:07.313
- be out of cigarettes.
- Just cigarettes. And I'm not mediocre in bed.

37:08.066 --> 37:09.523
I didn't say anything.

37:09.568 --> 37:11.011
I don't know.

37:11.056 --> 37:13.712
Whatever this weird psychology is
you're using,

37:13.747 --> 37:15.461
that's not gonna work either.

37:21.067 --> 37:22.490
Listen.

37:22.535 --> 37:25.110
I'm not trying to do anything,
I swear. I just

37:25.126 --> 37:28.230
like talking to you.
I like you.

37:28.275 --> 37:30.833
I have no tricks up my sleeve.

37:30.865 --> 37:32.560
it is what it is.

37:40.506 --> 37:42.162
Was that bad?

37:44.115 --> 37:45.790
It's a bad idea.

38:04.038 --> 38:06.302
Can, can you take me home?

38:06.345 --> 38:07.823
Please?

38:11.588 --> 38:14.562
I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have done that.
That was

38:14.595 --> 38:17.003
a bad idea, and I just, uh,
I think, look,

38:17.047 --> 38:19.670
if you could just take me back
to my mother's house, but..

38:19.706 --> 38:21.633
I'm sorry, I...

38:23.588 --> 38:25.010
I told you.

38:29.056 --> 38:29.983
Come on.

38:38.597 --> 38:40.122
Alright people.
It's about to start.

38:40.157 --> 38:41.780
If you've got your passes,
let's go.

38:45.145 --> 38:48.561
Nobody who shouldn't be on that set
is gonna get on the set, I promise you.

38:48.607 --> 38:50.642
- That's very good.
- Yeah.

38:51.457 --> 38:53.403
Hang on one sec. Excuse me.

39:16.558 --> 39:17.810
- "B-A-B-Y" by The Brunettes -

39:17.848 --> 39:19.542
Where’d everybody go?

39:20.998 --> 39:24.021
Jodi took them up to the rooftop
to show them her sculpture.

39:24.065 --> 39:26.432
Molly went home with Shane.

39:27.037 --> 39:29.240
Shane told me to say goodbye to you.

39:41.538 --> 39:44.761
This is really one of the most
excruciating things I’ve been through.

39:55.095 --> 39:57.362
I think we should go see Dan.

39:58.367 --> 40:02.343
- Dan Foxworthy?
- He knows us better than anyone.

40:02.387 --> 40:06.021
He can help us figure out
what the hell we’re doing.

40:07.617 --> 40:10.943
That was incredible.
Thank you for showing us.

40:14.075 --> 40:18.103
You guys should check out
Jodi's sculpture up there. It's amazing.

40:18.145 --> 40:20.021
I know. It's beautiful.

40:21.556 --> 40:24.523
- Do you wanna get going? I should really...
- Oh yeah,

40:24.567 --> 40:26.753
- I need to get up so early.
- Yeah.

40:28.358 --> 40:30.550
Thank you for dinner.
It was so nice to meet you.

40:30.585 --> 40:32.102
So nice to meet you too.

40:43.527 --> 40:47.190
Hey, Niki, you should kiss Greg.
They'll love it.

41:14.276 --> 41:16.103
There you are.

41:18.085 --> 41:22.340
Did you see that?
Niki just kissed Greg.

41:23.706 --> 41:26.883
Jenny, don't... Don't let that
upset you, okay?

41:26.918 --> 41:28.932
Look, there are photographers everywhere.

41:30.686 --> 41:33.641
- Yeah.
- They probably made her do that, okay?

41:34.217 --> 41:36.283
Just don't be upset.

41:36.315 --> 41:38.572
- Can we go home?
- Yeah, let's go.

41:45.578 --> 41:47.941
Major Dorough,
could you please explain

41:47.978 --> 41:50.322
the significance of this website?

41:50.365 --> 41:52.710
It's owned by Alice Pieszecki, Colonel.

41:52.747 --> 41:56.342
She does a podcast on a talk
on being a lesbian.

41:56.375 --> 42:00.523
She interviews other lesbians
about their sexlives

42:00.566 --> 42:02.942
and talks about her own sex life.

42:02.976 --> 42:06.452
So, Alice Pieszecki, the woman named
in two of the complaints

42:06.527 --> 42:10.740
against Captain Williams,
is a self-prophest lesbian?

42:10.777 --> 42:12.190
Yes, Ma'am, that's correct.

42:13.227 --> 42:14.792
And

42:14.827 --> 42:16.442
this chart?

42:16.485 --> 42:18.483
It's a chart of all the lesbians she knows

42:18.526 --> 42:20.563
who have had sex with one another.

42:22.495 --> 42:25.581
- Who've had sex with one another?
- Yes, Ma'am.

42:26.086 --> 42:27.963
It's not my chart, Colonel.

42:27.995 --> 42:29.783
If you know what I mean.

42:30.465 --> 42:33.792
Yes, thank you Major Dorough.
I think we all know what you mean.

42:34.707 --> 42:37.121
- Nothing further.
- Your witness, Captain Beech.

42:37.826 --> 42:39.333
Major Dorough,

42:41.978 --> 42:44.670
has Captain Williams' name appeared
anywhere in either the Chart

42:44.707 --> 42:46.461
- or the website?
- No, but...

42:46.495 --> 42:47.802
Thank you, Sir.

42:48.488 --> 42:49.942
No further questions.

42:52.518 --> 42:54.862
Do you swear, Miss,
to tell the truth,

42:54.896 --> 42:58.350
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?
So, help you God...

42:58.398 --> 42:59.713
I do.

43:04.556 --> 43:07.152
It's nice to see you again Ms. Pieszecki.

43:08.025 --> 43:09.890
I wish I could say the same.

43:11.286 --> 43:13.822
I saw you on television the other day...

43:13.858 --> 43:15.190
On "The Look".

43:15.225 --> 43:17.300
It was fun, very entertaining.

43:17.305 --> 43:18.793
I’d never seen it before.

43:19.627 --> 43:22.753
So, you are a lesbian, Miss Pieszecki?

43:23.308 --> 43:25.023
Last time I checked.

43:25.065 --> 43:27.711
How long have you known Captain Williams?

43:28.228 --> 43:30.513
I don't know. Maybe a year.
I'm not sure.

43:30.558 --> 43:32.993
How would you describe your relationship?

43:33.035 --> 43:34.502
We’re friends.

43:34.548 --> 43:37.102
And that doesn’t make Tasha a lesbian.

43:39.017 --> 43:43.231
I didn’t ask if
Captain Williams is a lesbian, Alice.

43:43.648 --> 43:46.333
You might want to stick
with the questions I ask.

43:47.918 --> 43:50.052
Do you know many people in the military?

43:50.098 --> 43:51.302
No.

43:51.345 --> 43:55.242
Well, I’m curious then.
How is it someone like yourself

43:55.275 --> 43:57.620
can meet someone like Captain Williams?

43:57.666 --> 44:00.583
We met through mutual friends...

44:00.618 --> 44:03.282
- at a gathering.
- A lesbian gathering?

44:04.008 --> 44:05.391
No.

44:05.436 --> 44:08.832
Have you had
sexual relations with Captain Williams?

44:14.045 --> 44:15.672
You know what?

44:16.407 --> 44:19.160
This whole thing,
this whole thing is a crock.

44:19.596 --> 44:21.333
It's a frickin' witch hunt.

44:22.346 --> 44:24.391
I mean, you're trying to say

44:24.395 --> 44:27.301
Tasha's a lesbian
because of her association with me.

44:27.336 --> 44:29.651
With lame, trumped up evidence.

44:29.697 --> 44:31.693
I'm sorry,
but I could just as easily say

44:31.706 --> 44:33.780
that I think you're a lesbian,
Colonel Davis.

44:33.818 --> 44:36.821
With the propensity to engage
in homosexual conduct.

44:36.855 --> 44:38.972
Because of the way you looked at me
in the hallway yesterday.

44:39.018 --> 44:41.693
- That is enough, Ms. Pieszecki.
- All I have to do

44:41.738 --> 44:45.332
is establish that you know a lesbian,
one lesbian,

44:45.378 --> 44:47.580
and maybe you had lunch with her once.

44:47.677 --> 44:49.392
I bet there aren't a lot of women
who wear that uniform

44:49.428 --> 44:52.051
who haven't eaten out
with a lesbian in their time.

44:52.095 --> 44:54.120
I'd like to request a 15 minute recess

44:54.126 --> 44:56.980
to let Ms. Pieszecki collect herself.

44:57.017 --> 44:59.640
Yes. We'll take a 15 minute recess.

44:59.678 --> 45:03.192
I'm okay. I mean, if you wanna keep...

45:04.116 --> 45:05.572
Did I say something?

45:21.587 --> 45:23.582
What you were trying to pull in there?!

45:23.616 --> 45:25.142
I wasn’t trying to pull anything.

45:25.185 --> 45:27.893
- Don’t play games with me, Alice.
- I'm not!

45:27.937 --> 45:29.320
Okay, here's the deal.

45:29.355 --> 45:32.082
I'm gonna need something from you.
Some kind of assurance

45:32.127 --> 45:34.382
that I don't have to watch my back.

45:35.017 --> 45:37.481
Okay, I'm listening.
What?

45:37.515 --> 45:40.011
Tell your friend Captain Williams
to play by the rules

45:40.046 --> 45:43.610
when she gets on the stand.
I'm going to ask her about Private Brown.

45:43.658 --> 45:46.293
She just has to tell the story,
matter-offact.

45:47.008 --> 45:49.230
The one about Brown seeing us
at the race track.

45:49.278 --> 45:53.253
And twisted an innocent day out with friends
into a sordid escapade

45:53.255 --> 45:55.640
so that he could make
his trumped up charges.

45:56.438 --> 45:58.970
And I’ll never have to see you again?

45:59.787 --> 46:01.600
No, you will

46:01.647 --> 46:03.512
never hear from me again.

46:03.547 --> 46:05.563
I won’t be calling you back on the stand,

46:05.595 --> 46:08.371
and I won’t be discussing this
with Captain Beech.

46:08.405 --> 46:12.401
So you have about five minutes to do
what you need to do before we resume.

46:17.447 --> 46:18.693
Oh my God!

46:35.806 --> 46:38.460
- Look, you have to listen to this.
- What? What are you doing?

46:39.496 --> 46:41.483
- I think you might walk out of this.
- What?!

46:41.528 --> 46:44.582
Yeah. Davis is terrified I’m going
to out her. She says

46:44.616 --> 46:47.080
she doesn’t want to have to watch her back.
So she just made a deal with me.

46:48.596 --> 46:51.103
She said, all you have to do
is tell the Brow story,

46:51.146 --> 46:53.413
and say you believe in
their bullshit code of honor, whatever,

46:53.445 --> 46:55.383
and she's gonna recommend you
for retention.

46:55.398 --> 46:57.391
- She's gonna let me off?
- I don't know.

46:57.425 --> 46:58.881
Captain Williams!

46:58.927 --> 47:01.701
- The hearing will resume in 5 minutes.
- I gotta go.

47:01.737 --> 47:03.053
Okay, good luck.

47:09.585 --> 47:11.890
One final question, Captain Williams.

47:11.925 --> 47:13.753
Why did you enter the military?

47:13.798 --> 47:16.160
I come from a military family.

47:16.206 --> 47:19.121
My father served, and his father before him.

47:19.156 --> 47:21.620
I feel a strong sense of duty
to serve my country.

47:21.647 --> 47:23.592
It’s what I’ve always wanted to do, Sir.

47:23.636 --> 47:24.873
Thank you.

47:25.597 --> 47:28.590
- No further questions.
- Recorder, your witness.

47:30.875 --> 47:35.300
Captain Williams, what is your relationship
to Private Jack Brown?

47:35.336 --> 47:38.840
Private Brown was a soldier
serving under my command.

47:38.885 --> 47:41.592
Does he hold a grudge against you
for any reason?

47:41.637 --> 47:44.532
He was upset with me
when I recommended Specialist Martinez

47:44.567 --> 47:46.983
for the Human Resources job
instead of him.

47:47.026 --> 47:50.712
It's been alleged that you gave
preferential treatment to Martinez

47:50.746 --> 47:54.183
because you were hopeful
of a more intimate relationship?

47:54.228 --> 47:55.492
That is not true.

47:55.536 --> 47:58.212
I recommended
Specialist Martinez for reclassification

47:58.248 --> 48:00.631
because she has a superior service record.

48:00.678 --> 48:03.972
She has two commendations
and she's disciplined and hard-working.

48:04.018 --> 48:06.043
Brown wasn’t qualified, Ma'am.

48:06.076 --> 48:09.390
Do you think Brown brought
these charges against you in retaliation?

48:09.438 --> 48:11.323
Yes, I do believe that.

48:11.367 --> 48:14.343
Does the military represent
the ideals and morals

48:14.388 --> 48:16.002
by which you live your life?

48:16.035 --> 48:18.081
Yes, absolutely, Ma'am.

48:18.115 --> 48:21.982
You’re aware, Captain, that
our armed services are strained for

48:22.028 --> 48:24.620
qualified, dedicated officers,

48:24.656 --> 48:27.701
- especially on the front lines.
- I'm aware of that, Ma'am.

48:27.738 --> 48:30.862
One last question... Do you agree
that the military codes of conduct

48:30.897 --> 48:34.150
to be strictly adhered to,
at all times?

48:35.058 --> 48:37.003
I always have.

48:37.598 --> 48:39.332
Until now.

48:41.577 --> 48:42.843
I’m sorry?

48:47.758 --> 48:51.563
One of the things that’s asked of us
when we go to the front lines

48:51.608 --> 48:55.622
is that we be prepared to be separated
from the people that we love.

48:55.668 --> 48:58.192
And we ask it of them, too.
We ask them to go

48:58.235 --> 49:00.160
and let us fight for their freedom,

49:00.205 --> 49:02.013
maybe to never come home.

49:02.045 --> 49:04.683
And when we do come home,
we feel blessed.

49:05.146 --> 49:07.560
It seems so wrong now

49:07.597 --> 49:11.890
to have my personal freedom denied to me
within my own country.

49:12.575 --> 49:15.921
It seems wrong to watch
the person that I love

49:15.966 --> 49:19.502
be interrogated like a criminal
when she did nothing wrong.

49:19.546 --> 49:21.800
Person you love.

49:22.596 --> 49:25.381
To whom are you referring, Captain Williams?

49:25.386 --> 49:28.040
Alice Pieszecki, Colonel.

49:37.598 --> 49:38.720
Wait!

49:42.737 --> 49:46.183
What happens? Did you win?
You look happy.

49:46.227 --> 49:47.952
I did. I won.

49:49.595 --> 49:52.001
I’m really glad for you. Really.

49:52.045 --> 49:54.850
So, what happened in there?

49:55.646 --> 49:57.362
I told them I loved you.

49:59.645 --> 50:01.383
Hey, there.

50:06.005 --> 50:08.170
Williams, you're gonna be missed
around here.

50:08.205 --> 50:09.881
Good bye.

50:13.816 --> 50:16.032
It's a shame, Captain Williams.

50:16.457 --> 50:19.040
Personal freedom is an enviable thing.

50:19.077 --> 50:20.892
But personal sacrifice

50:20.925 --> 50:24.230
to ensure that many more Americans
can enjoy their freedom...

50:24.267 --> 50:26.210
That's the nobler cause.

50:29.507 --> 50:30.881
Good luck to you.
