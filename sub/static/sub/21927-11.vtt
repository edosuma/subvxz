WEBVTT

00:06.256 --> 00:09.249
You walk down a hallway
and come to a wooden chest.

00:09.468 --> 00:11.380
Lord Gray Matter,
what do you do?

00:11.720 --> 00:14.713
I poke it with my dagger
to see if there are any traps.

00:15.724 --> 00:17.010
There are no traps.

00:17.226 --> 00:19.309
Fire Beak,
what do you do?

00:20.604 --> 00:22.186
- Billy?
- What?

00:22.481 --> 00:23.597
You are Fire Beak.

00:24.691 --> 00:25.852
Okay.

00:26.985 --> 00:28.226
So what do you do?

00:30.489 --> 00:31.605
I'm Fire Beak.

00:32.573 --> 00:33.280
<i>Hey, guys,</i>

00:33.492 --> 00:34.983
I brought snacks.

00:35.494 --> 00:36.450
Thanks, Mom.

00:36.662 --> 00:38.369
What are y'all playing,
Chutes and Ladders?

00:38.580 --> 00:41.118
Tam is teaching us
Dungeons & Dragons.

00:41.667 --> 00:42.407
Oh.

00:42.709 --> 00:43.449
<i>We're on a quest to find</i>

00:43.669 --> 00:46.286
the pitchfork of a devil
named Baalzebul.

00:46.630 --> 00:47.791
I'm Fire Beak.

00:48.924 --> 00:49.960
And is this the devil?

00:50.175 --> 00:52.542
No, he's just a monster
who doesn't wear pants.

00:53.011 --> 00:54.127
Oh, I see.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.968
Yes, oh, he's just hanging
right out there, isn't he?

00:57.558 --> 00:59.140
Okay, well...

01:00.602 --> 01:02.514
You kids have fun.

01:03.188 --> 01:05.305
<i>My mother
didn't believe in elves,</i>

01:05.524 --> 01:07.015
<i>fairies, or dragons.</i>

01:07.234 --> 01:07.974
George!

01:08.193 --> 01:09.309
<i>But she did believe</i>

01:09.528 --> 01:10.564
<i>in the devil.</i>

01:10.779 --> 01:12.145
<i>And she did not view him</i>

01:12.364 --> 01:14.606
<i>as an appropriate playmate
for her son.</i>

01:14.908 --> 01:15.739
<i>George!</i>

01:39.308 --> 01:39.968
I'm worried.

01:40.183 --> 01:43.517
There are incantations in this
book to summon actual demons.

01:44.146 --> 01:45.853
Is that how we
wound up with you?

01:46.690 --> 01:47.976
That's a good one.
I'm gonna give you that.

01:48.191 --> 01:49.227
This is not a joke.

01:49.443 --> 01:50.775
This is one of
the children's games

01:50.986 --> 01:52.147
we were warned about in church.

01:52.362 --> 01:54.024
Then tell him
to stop playing.

01:54.239 --> 01:55.446
<i>It's not that easy.</i>

01:55.657 --> 01:57.023
He's finally got
a couple of friends.

01:57.242 --> 01:58.608
I don't want to scare them off.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.069
Well, when you're
ready to scare kids,

02:01.288 --> 02:02.745
you got this face
locked and loaded.

02:03.749 --> 02:04.910
All right, the other one
was funny,

02:05.125 --> 02:07.082
now you're just being a jackass.

02:08.544 --> 02:10.161
I'm glad you're both amused,

02:10.380 --> 02:12.417
but our little boy's soul
may be at stake.

02:12.633 --> 02:13.464
Come on.

02:13.675 --> 02:15.541
When I was a kid, we were
listening to Black Sabbath,

02:15.761 --> 02:16.922
all that devil music.

02:17.596 --> 02:18.256
<i>Didn't hurt me.</i>

02:18.472 --> 02:19.929
Satan didn't get my soul.

02:20.140 --> 02:23.008
What happened to it?
You trade it for some donuts?

02:24.478 --> 02:27.312
You had that one coming.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.318
Hello? Mr. Sparks?

02:38.533 --> 02:40.149
- Oh, hello, Mary.
- Got a minute?

02:40.369 --> 02:41.530
Sure, what's up?

02:41.745 --> 02:45.159
Um, I was just concerned about a
game that the boys were playing

02:45.374 --> 02:46.785
and was wondering if
you and your wife

02:47.000 --> 02:47.786
knew about it.

02:48.001 --> 02:48.866
A game?

02:49.086 --> 02:51.294
Yes, a very disturbing one.

02:51.922 --> 02:52.537
Well, what're we talking about?

02:52.756 --> 02:54.338
Did you catch those boys
playing grab ass?

02:54.549 --> 02:58.384
No. Dungeons & Dragons.

02:58.595 --> 03:00.552
So everybody's got
their trousers up?

03:00.764 --> 03:02.255
- Yes.
- What's the problem?

03:03.016 --> 03:04.803
The game contains demonology,

03:05.018 --> 03:07.101
which goes against
the teachings of the church.

03:07.396 --> 03:09.183
But nobody's
touching nothing, right?

03:09.773 --> 03:10.638
No.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.189
Well, then I don't quite know
what you're worried about.

03:12.401 --> 03:13.733
- You don't?
- Nope.

03:13.944 --> 03:15.355
I'm just thankful Billy
found some friends

03:15.570 --> 03:18.028
and he ain't eating dirt
and crabgrass any more.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.531
Some point, he just
got a taste for it.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.526
<i>On an unrelated
note, uh,</i>

03:23.745 --> 03:24.986
you doing something new
with your hair?

03:25.205 --> 03:27.071
It looks, uh, real pretty.

03:28.583 --> 03:29.915
No, but thank you.

03:30.836 --> 03:32.452
Okay, well, I'm gonna
leave you to it.

03:32.671 --> 03:34.503
- Smells good, too.
- All right. Bye-bye.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.206
Hey, you want chicken
for dinner?

03:36.425 --> 03:38.007
I'll slaughter a big one
for you right now.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.004
I'm good.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.302
I'll kill one in case
you change your mind.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.302
Now which one of you's
tired of this life?

03:47.519 --> 03:48.555
You.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.898
Excuse me, Mr. Nguyen?

03:58.113 --> 03:58.728
Yes?

03:58.947 --> 04:01.155
Hi, you don't know me.
I'm Sheldon's mother.

04:01.366 --> 04:02.527
Ah, the smart boy.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.200
Yes, the smart boy.

04:04.453 --> 04:05.534
You are lucky.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.533
To have a smart son
is a great joy.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.372
I do not have that joy.

04:10.584 --> 04:13.247
Oh, I'm sure that's not true.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.620
Listen, are you aware
that Tam and Sheldon

04:15.839 --> 04:17.750
are playing Dungeons & Dragons?

04:18.048 --> 04:19.290
Dungeons & Dragons?

04:19.509 --> 04:23.173
Yes, and it's filled with
demons and satanic images.

04:33.815 --> 04:35.727
So what is the problem
with this game?

04:35.942 --> 04:36.648
The problem is,

04:36.860 --> 04:39.068
it goes against the
teachings of the church.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.771
All right. Listen to me.

04:41.990 --> 04:44.733
A problem is starving to death
in a Communist reeducation camp.

04:45.076 --> 04:46.362
<i>A problem is not
seeing your family</i>

04:46.578 --> 04:48.240
for many years while
you remove land mines

04:48.455 --> 04:50.242
from the Ho Chi Minh trail.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.915
A game boys play with
make-believe demons,

04:53.126 --> 04:54.458
not a problem.

04:55.921 --> 04:58.914
Well... I think they
can all be problems.

05:02.385 --> 05:04.251
I'm sorry, I agree with you.

05:04.471 --> 05:05.177
I will talk to Tam.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.717
Oh, good. Thank you.

05:08.183 --> 05:10.516
Well, bye. Nice meeting you.

05:13.104 --> 05:14.015
Five dollars.

05:24.241 --> 05:25.607
So, Pastor...

05:26.868 --> 05:28.109
How's things going
at the church?

05:28.328 --> 05:30.320
Please, call me Jeff.

05:30.539 --> 05:34.123
And everything's going great
'cause I have the coolest boss.

05:34.584 --> 05:37.748
I'm sorry, but I'm kind of
having a hard time

05:38.463 --> 05:41.046
feeling the Holy Spirit
calling you Jeff.

05:41.258 --> 05:43.124
I'm-I'm gonna stick with Pastor.

05:43.760 --> 05:44.546
Sure.

05:45.011 --> 05:46.843
Thank you, Pastor.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.054
Yeah, that feels better.

05:49.558 --> 05:52.642
So nice of you to
come over, Pastor Jeff.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.226
He prefers Jeff.

05:54.729 --> 05:56.140
I'm sticking with Pastor.

05:56.356 --> 05:59.019
Wait, I changed my mind.
I'm going with PJ.

05:59.818 --> 06:02.561
Brings to mind pajamas,
but that's fine, too.

06:03.488 --> 06:06.322
Anyway, I'm sorry to
drag you into this,

06:06.533 --> 06:08.866
but it is demons,
so it's in your purview.

06:09.077 --> 06:09.817
It is indeed.

06:10.036 --> 06:12.244
In fact, at a recent Young
Baptist Leaders Conference,

06:12.455 --> 06:15.198
I attended a seminar on
satanic leisure activities.

06:15.542 --> 06:16.453
And?

06:16.668 --> 06:18.330
And the important lesson is,

06:18.545 --> 06:20.912
rather than have a parent
or authority figure

06:21.131 --> 06:22.872
take the offending game away,

06:23.091 --> 06:25.629
let God remove it,
root and stem.

06:25.886 --> 06:29.926
Question, PJ.
Uh, how's the big guy do that?

06:30.223 --> 06:33.136
Simple, Sheldon needs to start
attending Sunday school.

06:33.351 --> 06:35.434
<i>If he likes books
with demons and devils,</i>

06:35.770 --> 06:38.478
I've got one that will
blow his mind.

06:39.065 --> 06:40.055
What book is that?

06:40.275 --> 06:41.356
The Bible, George.

06:41.568 --> 06:42.729
Sure, yeah.

06:43.361 --> 06:45.398
I think that's
a wonderful idea.

06:45.614 --> 06:47.105
Although, I am concerned

06:47.324 --> 06:49.691
that we may get a little
pushback from Sheldon.

06:50.619 --> 06:51.905
A little?

06:52.245 --> 06:53.361
No, I won't go.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.162
I don't believe in God.

06:55.540 --> 06:58.283
Well, now, what you
believe in is not the point.

06:58.501 --> 07:00.333
Mary, if I may...

07:00.545 --> 07:03.253
Sheldon, I understand you hope
to be a scientist someday.

07:03.590 --> 07:04.421
Yes, sir.

07:04.633 --> 07:05.840
Well, let me ask you a question.

07:06.051 --> 07:07.383
You say you don't
believe in God,

07:07.594 --> 07:09.506
but what kind of scientist
comes to a conclusion

07:09.721 --> 07:11.428
without first doing
the research?

07:12.265 --> 07:13.722
A bad scientist.

07:13.934 --> 07:14.890
That's right.

07:15.101 --> 07:17.343
So I'll see you
Sunday morning at 8:00.

07:17.687 --> 07:18.677
<i>No, you won't.</i>

07:18.897 --> 07:22.356
I cast a second level spell
of invisibility on myself.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.441
Well, that game isn't
making him any smarter.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.079
Shelly, why aren't you asleep?

07:46.007 --> 07:48.249
I'm studying for Sunday school.

07:48.510 --> 07:49.967
You're reading the Bible?

07:50.178 --> 07:51.885
That's wonderful.

07:52.347 --> 07:53.508
I do have a question.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.134
Sure, what?

07:55.433 --> 07:58.392
Is there anyone in our town
from the Amalek tribe?

07:58.853 --> 08:00.139
I don't know, why?

08:00.480 --> 08:04.645
If there is, we're supposed
to kill them and their cows.

08:04.859 --> 08:07.693
Well, no. There's
no Amaleks.

08:07.904 --> 08:09.315
Told you.

08:13.743 --> 08:15.655
And lead us not

08:15.870 --> 08:17.281
into temptation,

08:17.497 --> 08:20.080
but deliver us from evil.

08:20.291 --> 08:22.453
For thine is the kingdom

08:22.669 --> 08:24.877
and the power and the glory

08:25.088 --> 08:27.000
forever and forever.

08:27.215 --> 08:28.080
- And ever.
- Amen.

08:28.299 --> 08:30.586
- Amen!
- Very good.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.335
Now before we get
started this morning,

08:32.554 --> 08:34.716
I want to introduce
two new students,

08:34.931 --> 08:36.297
Sheldon and Missy Cooper.

08:36.515 --> 08:37.722
<i>Let's give them
a warm welcome.</i>

08:42.438 --> 08:43.270
Yes, Billy?

08:43.523 --> 08:44.855
I know them.

08:45.734 --> 08:46.474
Thank you, Billy.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.525
You're welcome, Pastor Jeff.

08:49.654 --> 08:51.361
Now, uh, last week,

08:51.573 --> 08:54.281
we started talking
about the Gospel of John.

08:54.492 --> 08:55.903
Does anybody
have a notion

08:56.119 --> 08:59.112
as to what God's getting
at in that passage?

08:59.497 --> 09:00.487
<i>Yes, Sheldon?</i>

09:00.707 --> 09:02.448
Chapter one, verse one states,

09:02.667 --> 09:04.203
"In the beginning was the Word,

09:04.419 --> 09:07.628
and the Word was with God
and the Word was God."

09:08.715 --> 09:09.501
Well done.

09:09.716 --> 09:12.208
Thank you. I read
the gospels last night.

09:12.427 --> 09:13.508
Suck up.

09:13.928 --> 09:15.965
Did you know when
the Bible says "the Word,"

09:16.181 --> 09:18.264
they're translating the
Greek expression "logos,"

09:18.475 --> 09:20.057
and logos means knowledge.

09:20.268 --> 09:22.976
Sounds like someone has
a noggin full of "logos."

09:23.855 --> 09:24.766
<i>Yes, Billy?</i>

09:24.981 --> 09:26.597
They live on my block.

09:27.484 --> 09:28.440
Terrific.

09:29.694 --> 09:31.777
<i>...as Ellis
will come in to punt.</i>

09:32.614 --> 09:34.230
<i>Five kicks, 38-yard average</i>

09:35.450 --> 09:36.691
I can't believe he's
reading the Bible.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.321
I know.

09:38.536 --> 09:40.949
I'm actually grateful to that
Dungeons & Dragons game.

09:41.164 --> 09:42.746
It helped lead him to God.

09:44.042 --> 09:45.954
Ixnay on the Odsgay.

09:49.547 --> 09:50.537
I'm done.

09:51.132 --> 09:52.248
You finished it?

09:52.759 --> 09:55.797
All of it. Ask me which
birds are kosher.

09:56.304 --> 09:58.136
I'll bite. Which birds
are kosher?

09:58.640 --> 10:01.053
Chickens, yes. Quail, yes.

10:01.267 --> 10:03.350
Owls, surprisingly no.

10:03.895 --> 10:05.682
Well, there ain't a lot of meat
on them anyway.

10:05.980 --> 10:06.595
<i>Shelly,</i>

10:06.815 --> 10:09.523
I'm so happy you're taking
an interest in religion.

10:09.776 --> 10:10.641
I am.

10:10.860 --> 10:13.944
And I've decided
to explore other religions, too.

10:14.447 --> 10:15.779
What's this, now?

10:15.990 --> 10:17.197
Pastor Jeff encouraged me

10:17.408 --> 10:19.070
to approach religion
scientifically,

10:19.285 --> 10:21.868
so it only makes sense
to enlarge my database.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.366
<i>No,
your database</i>

10:23.581 --> 10:25.743
is Baptist.
That's all the data you need.

10:25.959 --> 10:26.824
Baptist data.

10:28.169 --> 10:30.035
What other religions
you considering?

10:31.047 --> 10:32.379
Buddhist, Jewish,

10:32.590 --> 10:33.876
Hindu, Catholic, all of them.

10:34.092 --> 10:34.752
<i>Nope. Nope.</i>

10:34.968 --> 10:36.209
That's not happening.

10:36.553 --> 10:40.422
Well, why? As an American, don't
I have freedom of religion?

10:41.766 --> 10:42.722
Um...

10:43.351 --> 10:44.967
Those dungeons and dragons
are looking pretty good

10:45.186 --> 10:46.643
right now, aren't they?

10:47.230 --> 10:49.187
I'm also looking into voodoo.

10:55.363 --> 10:57.025
Tam, you're Catholic, right?

10:57.240 --> 10:57.946
Yes.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.399
Explain it to me.

11:00.743 --> 11:01.574
Explain what?

11:01.786 --> 11:03.448
Well, for starters,
who do you pray to?

11:04.372 --> 11:07.206
I guess, Jesus, God, and Mary.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.082
Jesus isn't God?

11:09.294 --> 11:10.785
No, he's his son.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.878
But you do eat him,
and drink his blood.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.873
Oh, there's
also a ghost,

11:16.134 --> 11:17.341
but not the scary kind.

11:17.635 --> 11:18.842
Like Casper?

11:19.053 --> 11:20.089
Exactly.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.513
And how does the pope work?

11:22.974 --> 11:23.634
Well,

11:23.850 --> 11:25.091
the pope lives in Italy.

11:25.310 --> 11:28.644
He has a special car,
and a big pointy hat.

11:29.272 --> 11:30.729
It's a wonderful hat.

11:31.065 --> 11:32.977
And is there anything else
I should know about?

11:33.276 --> 11:34.187
Every once in a while,

11:34.402 --> 11:35.938
you have to confess your sins
to a priest.

11:36.321 --> 11:38.187
Not me, I don't have any sins.

11:38.406 --> 11:39.942
Then you have the sin of pride.

11:41.659 --> 11:44.026
Your religion
is making me feel bad.

11:44.245 --> 11:45.656
That's how you know
it's working.

11:48.124 --> 11:50.036
Ms. Hutchins, what's
your religion?

11:50.251 --> 11:51.537
I'm a Mormon, why?

11:51.753 --> 11:53.710
I'm conducting
a research project.

11:53.922 --> 11:55.879
Can you tell me
about being a Mormon?

11:56.799 --> 11:58.381
Well, it started in New York,

11:58.635 --> 12:01.753
when a man found gold plates
buried underground.

12:01.971 --> 12:02.757
<i>The plates
said that,</i>

12:02.972 --> 12:05.885
when we die,
we get to go to our own planet.

12:06.267 --> 12:07.383
Unless you're a woman,

12:07.602 --> 12:09.309
then you have to go
to your husband's planet.

12:09.812 --> 12:11.019
But that won't be

12:11.231 --> 12:12.688
a problem for me.

12:12.899 --> 12:14.265
I don't have a husband.

12:14.609 --> 12:16.475
All I have is a cat.

12:16.694 --> 12:18.856
A big, mean cat.

12:19.197 --> 12:19.812
Oh...

12:20.031 --> 12:21.818
Maybe I'll get to go
to <i>his</i> planet.

12:24.285 --> 12:26.698
Lonely Cheryl on Planet Cat.

12:28.623 --> 12:30.410
I like her. She's funny.

12:33.169 --> 12:34.159
<i>You're gonna love Ira.</i>

12:34.379 --> 12:35.711
<i>He's a great guy.</i>

12:35.964 --> 12:37.250
Is he your boyfriend?

12:37.507 --> 12:39.544
Well, he's one of them,
so let's not bring that up.

12:42.053 --> 12:43.635
- Hey.
- Is this a good time?

12:43.846 --> 12:45.883
Absolutely.
Come in, come in.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.590
Ira, this is my
grandson Sheldon.

12:47.809 --> 12:49.892
Sheldon, this is my friend Ira.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.810
- Hello.
- Howdy.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.264
So Meemaw tells me
you're Jewish.

12:55.525 --> 12:56.641
Right to it, huh?

12:56.859 --> 12:58.350
All right, let's do this.

12:58.569 --> 12:59.229
Please, sit down.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.027
Thank you so much
for helping out.

13:01.239 --> 13:03.606
Aw, Connie, you know,
anything for you.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.153
So, Sheldon,

13:05.368 --> 13:06.074
you hungry?

13:06.286 --> 13:07.618
You want a nosh?

13:07.912 --> 13:09.744
I don't know,
I've never eaten a nosh.

13:10.081 --> 13:11.993
Uh, no, a nosh isn't a thing,

13:12.208 --> 13:13.198
it's a... never mind.

13:13.418 --> 13:15.705
Um, would you care
for some hard candy?

13:16.546 --> 13:17.662
Are they kosher?

13:18.047 --> 13:19.163
Who are you, my mother?

13:20.425 --> 13:21.882
All right,
so what can I do for you?

13:23.094 --> 13:24.710
What's it like to be Jewish?

13:24.929 --> 13:27.012
Oh, it's terrible.
I don't recommend it.

13:27.265 --> 13:28.927
- Why?
- Well, for starters,

13:29.142 --> 13:32.010
your life is hemmed in
by ancient, pointless rules.

13:32.228 --> 13:34.470
There's a lot of yelling,
and, uh,

13:34.689 --> 13:37.306
you're probably not gonna get
into a good country club.

13:38.109 --> 13:39.190
What about God?

13:39.402 --> 13:40.518
What about him?

13:40.737 --> 13:42.194
Does he play a part
in your life?

13:42.864 --> 13:46.357
Well, historically, he's gotten
a kick out of punishing us.

13:46.701 --> 13:47.862
What about Jesus?

13:48.077 --> 13:49.363
He was Jewish.

13:49.579 --> 13:51.195
Oh, we've got
a lot of celebrities.

13:51.414 --> 13:53.827
Uh, we've got, uh,
we got William Shatner,

13:54.042 --> 13:55.283
and Leonard Nimoy...

13:55.501 --> 13:57.538
Kirk <i>and</i> Spock?

13:57.754 --> 13:58.790
I want to be Jewish.

13:59.005 --> 14:00.667
Hold on a second.

14:00.882 --> 14:02.464
Hold... I got a question
for you, Sheldon.

14:02.675 --> 14:05.543
When you grow up, are you
planning on living in Texas?

14:07.263 --> 14:07.923
Probably.

14:08.139 --> 14:10.882
Then I strongly advise you
to stay Baptist.

14:11.225 --> 14:12.932
Maybe even wear a cross.

14:13.936 --> 14:15.302
Why did <i>you</i> move to Texas?

14:15.521 --> 14:16.978
Well, that's simple.

14:17.190 --> 14:20.354
Medford had no Jews,
so there was an opening for one.

14:20.902 --> 14:22.609
And you got it? Good for you.

14:24.781 --> 14:25.988
I love this kid.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.440
Me, too.

14:28.910 --> 14:29.991
Mwah.

14:38.002 --> 14:38.617
Hey.

14:39.128 --> 14:40.335
How's it going?

14:40.546 --> 14:44.381
Good. Did you know that
Zoroaster believed in two gods?

14:44.592 --> 14:46.675
- No, I did not.
<i>- And the Taoists</i>

14:46.886 --> 14:47.922
don't believe in God at all.

14:48.137 --> 14:50.174
They believe
in a principle of harmony.

14:50.431 --> 14:51.547
How very nice for them.

14:51.766 --> 14:53.883
Shelly, I understand
you enjoy researching things.

14:54.143 --> 14:55.054
Love it.

14:56.145 --> 14:57.556
But it's important
to keep in mind

14:57.772 --> 15:00.059
that there is only one true God.

15:00.274 --> 15:02.231
That's called monotheism.

15:03.027 --> 15:04.939
I have a book about it
if you're interested.

15:06.072 --> 15:09.156
That's okay,
I have <i>the</i> book about it.

15:11.160 --> 15:14.244
Would you be angry with me
if I don't pick your religion?

15:16.290 --> 15:17.906
I could never be angry with you.

15:19.669 --> 15:22.207
You be a seeker
of your own truth.

15:24.549 --> 15:25.710
Thanks, Mom.

15:29.470 --> 15:31.883
And if the truth turns out
to be Satan,

15:32.098 --> 15:33.634
I will do battle with him.

15:55.746 --> 15:57.453
<i>Welcome, Sheldon.</i>

15:58.791 --> 16:00.703
<i>We've been
waiting for you.</i>

16:01.127 --> 16:03.210
Are you the Ten Commandments?

16:03.463 --> 16:04.294
<i>No.</i>

16:04.505 --> 16:05.916
<i>We are one.</i>

16:06.132 --> 16:07.418
<i>And zero.</i>

16:07.800 --> 16:09.291
<i>We are the binary code</i>

16:09.510 --> 16:11.502
<i>that underlies
the universe.</i>

16:11.721 --> 16:14.714
<i>The ten thing is
a common mistake.</i>

16:15.308 --> 16:17.595
I want to understand God.

16:17.810 --> 16:18.641
Can you help me?

16:18.853 --> 16:20.640
<i>Did you not hear
what we just said?</i>

16:20.855 --> 16:23.472
<i>It's a binary universe.</i>

16:23.691 --> 16:25.023
<i>God is yes and no.</i>

16:25.234 --> 16:26.145
<i>Left and right.</i>

16:26.360 --> 16:27.567
<i>On and off.</i>

16:27.778 --> 16:28.894
<i>Something and nothing.</i>

16:29.113 --> 16:30.604
<i>Positive and negative.</i>

16:30.823 --> 16:31.904
<i>Male and female.</i>

16:32.116 --> 16:33.277
<i>Light and dark.</i>

16:33.493 --> 16:36.327
But why is there
evil and suffering?

16:36.537 --> 16:38.119
<i>Well, without evil
and suffering,</i>

16:38.331 --> 16:40.163
<i>there is no good
and happiness.</i>

16:40.541 --> 16:42.908
Oh, sure. Binary.

16:43.252 --> 16:45.995
<i>Shall we give him the
final piece of information</i>

16:46.214 --> 16:49.332
<i>that unlocks the secret
of the universe?</i>

16:49.634 --> 16:50.294
<i>Why not?</i>

16:50.510 --> 16:53.719
<i>At least one human being should
know the reason for everything.</i>

16:53.930 --> 16:55.296
<i>Sheldon,</i>

16:56.265 --> 16:58.427
<i>before the
universe began...</i>

17:00.520 --> 17:01.306
<i>Hey, dummy.</i>

17:01.521 --> 17:03.103
You're drooling
all over your books.

17:03.314 --> 17:05.852
Huh? No.

17:06.067 --> 17:08.980
Zero was about to tell me
the secret and you ruined it.

17:10.404 --> 17:13.317
<i>I never heard
from One and Zero again.</i>

17:13.699 --> 17:17.409
<i>Although, I was once visited
by Nine when I had chickenpox.</i>

17:17.619 --> 17:20.738
<i>He was a lot less funny
than he thought he was.</i>

17:22.208 --> 17:25.952
<i>Okay, "What God means to me."</i>

17:26.712 --> 17:28.044
Who'd like to go first?

17:28.464 --> 17:29.170
Billy.

17:29.382 --> 17:30.748
I'd like to go third.

17:32.093 --> 17:32.833
All righty.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.509
Who's feeling brave?

17:35.304 --> 17:36.044
Missy.

17:36.264 --> 17:37.254
I'll go second.

17:37.848 --> 17:40.215
Great. Does anybody want
to go first?

17:40.434 --> 17:41.265
I'll go.

17:41.852 --> 17:42.808
Okay. Come on up here,
Sheldon.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.682
Let's hear what you got.

17:46.816 --> 17:48.148
I've spent the last week

17:48.359 --> 17:49.895
studying what people believe,

17:50.111 --> 17:51.818
and I've come to a conclusion.

17:52.029 --> 17:53.110
And what's that?

17:53.573 --> 17:54.859
I'm starting my own religion.

17:55.074 --> 17:55.939
I'm sorry, what?

17:56.325 --> 17:57.907
I'm calling it Mathology.

17:58.119 --> 18:00.406
It's based
on a universal binary system.

18:00.621 --> 18:03.409
That's terrific, Sheldon, but
this is a Baptist Sunday school.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.957
I know, I'm here
to convert everybody.

18:06.252 --> 18:07.663
- Any takers?
- Okay.

18:07.962 --> 18:09.578
<i>Let's go have
a talk with your mom.</i>

18:09.797 --> 18:12.835
The only sin in Mathology
is being stupid.

18:21.392 --> 18:23.850
Welcome to the Church
of Mathology.

18:24.061 --> 18:25.893
Today, I'd like to talk
about prime numbers,

18:26.105 --> 18:27.687
and why they bring us joy.

18:27.898 --> 18:29.730
Hallelujah!
