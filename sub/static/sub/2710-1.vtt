BEST ACTRESS - CANNES 1999

01:55.158 --> 01:56.826
Come to my office.

01:57.035 --> 01:59.287
I said come to my office!

02:00.789 --> 02:03.416
- Did you tell them I'm always late?
- That's not the issue!

02:03.541 --> 02:06.753
- Yes or no?
- I said it was 'cause of the bus.

02:06.878 --> 02:08.797
That's not important.
Come to my office.

02:08.963 --> 02:12.467
- Why'd you say she said that?
- That's not why you were fired!

02:12.634 --> 02:15.220
Am I a good worker?
Then why fire me?

02:15.345 --> 02:19.182
- Because your trial period is over.
- Why me, if I'm a good worker?

02:19.307 --> 02:23.144
You're the only one on a trial basis.
Now change and come to my office.

02:23.311 --> 02:24.562
Come on!

02:24.687 --> 02:26.189
Stop it!

02:36.658 --> 02:38.743
Leave or I'll call the -

02:41.579 --> 02:43.289
Calm down!

03:27.208 --> 03:29.127
Open this door!

03:29.294 --> 03:31.421
- You have to leave!
- You have no right!

03:31.546 --> 03:34.883
I did my job well.
Everyone says so!

03:35.675 --> 03:37.927
I'll force this door open!

03:40.013 --> 03:41.723
That's enough now.

03:43.433 --> 03:45.059
Let me go!

07:31.494 --> 07:32.995
Shut up.

07:36.165 --> 07:37.792
Any mail?
- No.

07:37.959 --> 07:40.753
There's a fox on the prowl.
Don't leave food out.

07:54.642 --> 07:56.811
Why are you planting all that?

07:56.936 --> 07:58.980
We're not staying here.

08:32.972 --> 08:34.472
What's this?

08:34.849 --> 08:36.976
It wasn't me.
I don't even like that brand.

08:37.101 --> 08:39.854
- How'd the cork get here?
- I don't know.

08:42.190 --> 08:43.941
You reek of beer.

08:45.860 --> 08:48.487
He brought you booze
so he could fuck you, right?

08:48.613 --> 08:50.990
That's not true. I'm your mother!
Don't talk to me that way!

08:51.115 --> 08:53.075
Swear it's not true.

08:56.370 --> 08:58.080
That's my tub.

08:58.372 --> 09:00.958
- Leave me alone.
- Go dry out.

09:14.263 --> 09:16.057
Where'd you get that?

09:17.767 --> 09:19.644
Where'd you get that?
- Someone gave it to me.

09:19.769 --> 09:22.146
- Was it him?
- The people I pick up clothes from.

09:22.271 --> 09:23.981
- You've been begging.
- They gave it to me!

09:24.106 --> 09:25.942
- Why didn't you say no?
- I don't turn down mending -

09:26.067 --> 09:28.694
That's different!
You mend clothes and I sell them.

09:28.819 --> 09:30.446
Throw it out.

09:31.030 --> 09:32.657
We're not beggars.

13:27.683 --> 13:29.310
Not this one either.

13:30.936 --> 13:32.188
Why?

13:32.313 --> 13:34.148
They're summer clothes.

13:35.357 --> 13:37.109
I'll take this dress.

13:44.825 --> 13:46.494
Nothing else.

13:48.162 --> 13:50.122
That's 450 francs.

13:56.337 --> 13:59.423
- You need a salesgirl?
- Not right now.

14:28.035 --> 14:30.412
‘The Grand Canyon’ -
is that your address ?

14:30.746 --> 14:33.040
<i>Is that a café ?
A fairground ?</i>

14:33.207 --> 14:34.750
A fairground.

14:37.920 --> 14:39.964
I can't put you down
as unemployed.

14:40.089 --> 14:42.424
- I worked.
- Not long enough.

14:43.551 --> 14:46.845
Go to window 8.
You may be eligible for welfare.

15:01.068 --> 15:02.570
Why won't you take them?

15:02.695 --> 15:05.322
They're out of season.
I have dozens from last summer.

15:05.447 --> 15:08.867
- The whole bunch for 500 francs.
- That's still too much.

15:11.704 --> 15:13.372
Name a price.

15:15.583 --> 15:17.251
Four hundred.

15:18.961 --> 15:20.421
Three hundred.

15:20.546 --> 15:22.256
Three fifty.

15:23.465 --> 15:25.092
All right, 350.

15:50.784 --> 15:53.954
One waffle, three beers,
and three nonalcoholic beers.

15:54.705 --> 15:56.749
Did you take that girl's place?

15:59.168 --> 16:00.169
Hello.

16:00.294 --> 16:02.129
No problems?

16:21.106 --> 16:23.901
- I'm leaving 2,000 in the till.
- Okay.

16:25.402 --> 16:29.156
Sir, are you looking
for anyone to sell waffles?

16:30.157 --> 16:31.742
Or anything else?

16:31.867 --> 16:33.786
Not at the moment.

16:33.911 --> 16:35.245
Sorry.

16:46.173 --> 16:48.467
What did you talk
to the boss about?

16:51.428 --> 16:53.222
You looking for work?

17:03.482 --> 17:05.358
Get me some water.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.989
- When I used to get that-
- I don't care.

17:11.115 --> 17:14.867
- I can tell you at least.
- You tell me every time. I'm not you.

17:21.666 --> 17:23.377
Hold the glass for me.

17:47.651 --> 17:49.987
- It's not 6:00 yet.
- But you're home.

17:50.112 --> 17:52.823
'Cause I got fired,
not so you could go drinking.

17:53.323 --> 17:54.783
Give it back!

17:55.743 --> 17:57.244
Give it back!

17:59.830 --> 18:01.081
Give it to me.

18:02.916 --> 18:05.294
All you think about
is drinking and fucking.

19:30.337 --> 19:32.005
Let me have one.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.841
Get out of here.

21:38.423 --> 21:41.426
- Why do you bring her alcohol?
- Just one drink.

21:41.551 --> 21:43.637
You know she's trying to stop.

21:45.555 --> 21:47.516
- Give it back!
- Leave her alone!

21:48.475 --> 21:50.268
Give it back!

21:50.394 --> 21:52.437
You owe me 120 francs!

21:53.647 --> 21:55.774
Go to a whorehouse
if you want to fuck!

21:55.899 --> 21:57.734
My mother's not a whore!

21:57.859 --> 21:59.444
Leave her alone!

22:04.741 --> 22:05.993
Leave her alone!

22:19.673 --> 22:22.092
Who told you I lived here?

22:59.379 --> 23:01.923
There's an opening.
The boss fired someone.

24:04.402 --> 24:07.489
Okay, now we add
two quarts of water.

24:07.614 --> 24:10.033
Get the measuring cup down there

24:10.617 --> 24:12.119
and set it here.

24:15.455 --> 24:18.500
Hold tight here,
and careful with the pressure.

24:26.466 --> 24:27.968
A little more.

24:28.635 --> 24:30.137
Good.

24:37.352 --> 24:38.854
Pour it in.

24:43.108 --> 24:45.527
No, always back
where you got it.

24:46.611 --> 24:49.114
Now four sacks of flour.

24:49.489 --> 24:51.491
I'll show you how to carry them.

24:52.325 --> 24:54.494
Slide it onto your knee

24:54.619 --> 24:56.329
and grab it like this.

25:02.627 --> 25:04.921
Lay it over the edge of the bowl.

25:09.676 --> 25:12.304
Pull on the string

25:12.762 --> 25:16.349
and move around the bowl
as you pour it in.

25:22.981 --> 25:24.524
Then back this way.

25:27.777 --> 25:29.863
Now I'll add 200 eggs.

25:30.822 --> 25:34.701
Six trays of 20 each.
You get the other sacks of flour.

25:36.536 --> 25:38.872
You forgot to stamp my form.

25:39.039 --> 25:40.457
I did?

25:43.710 --> 25:46.880
They said I was entitled to miss work.
You can't fire me.

25:47.047 --> 25:48.173
They're wrong.

25:48.298 --> 25:51.593
- You know my baby's sick.
- Not ten times a month!

26:44.604 --> 26:46.481
It's caught under the wheel.

26:49.609 --> 26:51.027
There.

26:55.573 --> 26:57.659
- Anyone here?
- I'm coming.

26:57.909 --> 27:00.829
Wanna go for a drink?
I'm off at 4:30.

27:03.248 --> 27:06.001
Then see you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

28:23.536 --> 28:25.163
Look.

28:26.581 --> 28:28.208
That's good.

28:52.315 --> 28:54.317
You wanna take it to him?

29:03.868 --> 29:06.913
Tell him he can't turn it off
without telling us first.

30:19.694 --> 30:21.196
Get out.

30:28.119 --> 30:29.746
The 500 francs.

30:38.087 --> 30:39.589
A receipt.

30:49.933 --> 30:51.684
Turn the water on first.

30:51.851 --> 30:53.228
Pay and I'll turn it on.

30:53.353 --> 30:56.189
I'm here to pay the rent,
not to get the water back on.

30:56.314 --> 30:58.566
- I don't see the difference.
- I do.

31:23.633 --> 31:25.218
Brush your hair.

31:29.973 --> 31:31.349
Get up.

31:34.602 --> 31:36.271
And put your shoes on.

31:44.195 --> 31:46.072
Where's your ID card?

31:46.197 --> 31:48.116
In your box?

32:50.219 --> 32:52.096
I don't want to go!

32:52.513 --> 32:54.015
Let me go!

33:16.871 --> 33:18.373
Come on.

33:21.084 --> 33:24.212
It's the only way you'll make it.
They'll take care of you.

33:24.337 --> 33:26.464
I don't care if I make it!

33:54.617 --> 33:55.952
Come on.

34:02.166 --> 34:06.003
I'll try to get you a sewing machine
when you come back.

34:11.926 --> 34:13.928
What's a used one cost?

34:48.420 --> 34:49.755
Morn!

34:53.176 --> 34:54.927
It's all muddy!

35:08.649 --> 35:10.443
It's all muddy!

37:02.179 --> 37:03.639
<i>Come in</i>

37:05.892 --> 37:09.061
- How'd you know I lived here?
- I asked the boss.

37:12.481 --> 37:16.110
You can put your cooking stuff there,
and there's water there.

37:20.990 --> 37:23.451
You can plug a heater in there.

37:27.079 --> 37:30.082
I don't think she's asking much.
- How much?

37:31.542 --> 37:34.670
Less than what I pay.
Less than 5,000 francs.

37:35.087 --> 37:37.006
There's a shower over there.

37:51.938 --> 37:55.149
Needs a little work.
I could fix it up for you.

37:56.609 --> 37:58.611
- Could I have those boots?
- What boots?

37:58.736 --> 38:00.321
Down there.

38:11.916 --> 38:13.668
You make waffles?

38:13.793 --> 38:16.712
No, it's just a waffle iron
I'm trying to fix.

38:16.837 --> 38:18.965
Want a beer?
- Just water.

38:34.313 --> 38:35.773
Give me the boots.

39:04.552 --> 39:06.262
Did you win that?

39:07.596 --> 39:08.848
Yeah.

39:10.141 --> 39:12.518
I was a champion
in floor gymnastics.

39:13.019 --> 39:15.021
Well, provincial champion.

39:27.867 --> 39:29.201
Wait.

40:20.127 --> 40:23.380
- You been doing it long?
- Doing what?

40:23.506 --> 40:25.508
Your scam with the waffles.

40:25.633 --> 40:27.301
From the start.

40:42.650 --> 40:45.653
What did you come
behind the stand to tell me?

40:45.945 --> 40:47.404
Nothing.

40:47.613 --> 40:49.031
Nothing?

40:50.616 --> 40:52.618
I wanted to watch you work.

40:57.039 --> 40:58.874
- More to drink?
- Yeah.

41:00.459 --> 41:01.961
A beer.

41:12.471 --> 41:14.515
- More French toast?
- Yeah.

41:21.313 --> 41:22.857
Thanks.

42:11.989 --> 42:14.366
- What music do you like?
- What?

42:14.533 --> 42:16.327
What music do you like?

42:16.535 --> 42:18.245
I don't know. Anything.

42:19.330 --> 42:21.540
- Wanna hear some drums?
- Yeah.

42:23.584 --> 42:27.046
It's me playing some stuff.
I tape it to get better.

42:27.171 --> 42:30.090
- You play in a group?
- I'm starting to.

42:30.799 --> 42:33.010
I practice on a friend's set.

42:34.845 --> 42:36.722
You play anything?

43:09.713 --> 43:12.174
It's pretty bad.
I'll turn it off if you want.

43:24.645 --> 43:27.022
This part I do okay.

43:42.788 --> 43:44.790
This is the same stuff
with my group.

43:50.462 --> 43:51.964
Not bad, huh?

43:54.550 --> 43:56.802
Wanna dance?
- I don't know how.

43:56.969 --> 43:58.470
Doesn't matter.

44:13.485 --> 44:14.820
Come on.

44:15.654 --> 44:17.323
It's easy.

44:18.115 --> 44:19.533
Come on.

44:28.584 --> 44:30.711
Hold my hand tight.

44:34.298 --> 44:36.175
Keep your arm firm.

44:41.847 --> 44:43.098
Hold on.

44:43.849 --> 44:45.851
That's where I mess up.

44:58.655 --> 45:01.075
Watch my feet.
That's the basic step.

45:31.647 --> 45:33.107
What's wrong?

45:36.110 --> 45:37.611
What's wrong?

45:38.487 --> 45:40.322
Rosetta, what's wrong?

45:43.742 --> 45:44.743
What's wrong?

45:57.089 --> 45:58.757
I forgot the boots.

46:03.971 --> 46:05.889
You want a ride home?

46:28.120 --> 46:31.123
I don't want to go back
to the trailer tonight.

47:02.237 --> 47:03.906
Good night.

47:25.928 --> 47:27.846
Your name is Rosetta.

47:29.723 --> 47:31.475
My name is Rosetta.

47:33.685 --> 47:35.437
You found a job.

47:37.314 --> 47:38.941
I found a job.

47:41.151 --> 47:42.945
You made a friend.

47:44.279 --> 47:46.114
I made a friend.

47:48.242 --> 47:50.244
You have a normal life.

47:51.954 --> 47:53.705
I have a normal life.

47:55.541 --> 47:57.793
You won't be left by the wayside.

47:59.086 --> 48:01.296
I won't be left by the wayside.

48:05.050 --> 48:06.552
Good night.

48:46.008 --> 48:48.969
- You're replacing me?
- It's just temporary.

48:50.596 --> 48:52.347
Where am I gonna go?

48:52.472 --> 48:56.476
If a job opens up, it's yours,
but I have nothing right now.

49:07.779 --> 49:09.448
Where are you going?

49:13.952 --> 49:16.830
Why are you taking my job?

49:16.955 --> 49:18.457
Calm down!

49:19.041 --> 49:20.459
Calm down!

49:20.584 --> 49:23.462
He can go to some other school!
It's my job!

49:23.629 --> 49:25.589
I'm the boss here.
Settle down!

49:26.089 --> 49:28.175
Okay? Just calm down!

49:28.300 --> 49:29.968
Get up, you big lump.

49:36.350 --> 49:38.310
How can I make it any clearer?

49:38.477 --> 49:40.979
It's only been three days.
You can't do this.

49:41.146 --> 49:43.148
I wish my son
wasn't a fuckup, but -

49:43.273 --> 49:45.317
He messes up
and he gets a job,

49:45.442 --> 49:47.277
but I'm out in the street!

49:47.402 --> 49:49.237
Give me that sack.

49:49.488 --> 49:51.990
I'll give you severance pay.

49:52.115 --> 49:55.744
- No, I'm staying!
- It'll just be a few weeks -

49:55.869 --> 49:58.413
I want a job and a normal life
like everyone else!

49:58.538 --> 50:00.582
That's enough now.
Give me that.

50:02.334 --> 50:03.877
Give it to me.

50:04.878 --> 50:06.630
Give it to me!

52:38.740 --> 52:41.201
- No, sorry.
- Maybe later on?

52:41.368 --> 52:45.038
Anyone on a trial basis?
- We have a waiting list.

53:52.898 --> 53:55.233
If you need help,
you can tell me.

53:55.400 --> 53:56.943
I'm looking for work.

53:57.068 --> 53:59.029
We only hire
the long-term unemployed.

53:59.154 --> 54:00.864
What about cleaning your offices?

54:00.989 --> 54:03.575
Volunteers do that.
I'm sorry.

54:03.742 --> 54:05.201
Good-bye.

54:15.837 --> 54:17.130
Thanks.

54:20.050 --> 54:21.760
Thanks. Good-bye.

54:22.385 --> 54:24.471
Maybe his son will hate it.

54:24.888 --> 54:28.391
Or maybe he'll hire you for the counter.
He has 12 stands.

54:28.516 --> 54:30.185
<i>A waffle, please</i>

54:35.982 --> 54:37.525
Forty francs.

54:41.029 --> 54:43.448
- Here's 40 francs.
- Don't worry about it.

54:45.200 --> 54:47.369
- See you tomorrow.
- Hold on.

54:47.494 --> 54:49.746
- I'm catching the bus.
- Hold on!

54:49.871 --> 54:51.790
Wanna come to my place tonight?

54:51.915 --> 54:53.959
Want me to come
by the campground?

55:02.467 --> 55:04.594
- You still mean what you said?
- What?

55:04.719 --> 55:08.431
- If a job opens up, it's mine?
- Yeah. But the light's changed.

55:08.556 --> 55:10.475
But will I have a job?

55:10.600 --> 55:13.311
I don't know.
I can't say in advance!

55:42.632 --> 55:44.884
The entrance
is on the other side.

57:45.672 --> 57:46.881
What do you want?

57:47.006 --> 57:49.801
If you need money,
I can lend you some.

57:49.968 --> 57:52.846
- No need.
- You sure? What about the apartment?

57:53.304 --> 57:55.098
I don't care about the apartment.

57:55.223 --> 57:56.683
What are you doing?

57:56.808 --> 57:59.185
I thought you were the attendant.
I threw my lines in.

57:59.310 --> 58:02.397
- Your what?
- My lines, with my trout traps.

58:02.522 --> 58:04.149
I caught one.

58:05.191 --> 58:06.693
Gimme that.

58:09.946 --> 58:11.573
Give me your hand.

58:27.922 --> 58:29.591
I'm sinking!

58:31.092 --> 58:32.552
Rosetta!

58:42.729 --> 58:43.938
I'm sinking.

59:15.178 --> 59:16.763
Grab hold!

59:20.600 --> 59:22.685
Quick! I'm sinking!

59:28.900 --> 59:30.485
Quick!

59:42.914 --> 59:44.374
Pull!

01:00:05.353 --> 01:00:06.896
I slipped.

01:00:47.228 --> 01:00:48.980
Wring it out more.

01:00:54.944 --> 01:00:57.822
If you want, you can come
dry off at the trailer.

01:00:57.947 --> 01:00:59.907
No, I'll change at home.

01:02:10.686 --> 01:02:13.564
- Didn't you see me?
- I didn't think it was open.

01:02:13.856 --> 01:02:15.608
Want some coffee?

01:02:17.527 --> 01:02:19.028
Come on.

01:02:30.081 --> 01:02:31.541
You coming?

01:02:40.091 --> 01:02:41.551
Come inside.

01:02:42.844 --> 01:02:44.095
Come on.

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:49.600
It's hot.
It'll do you good.

01:02:57.442 --> 01:03:00.236
You could make
the batter for my waffles.

01:03:00.445 --> 01:03:04.031
I sell ten a day.
Comes to 15,000 francs a month.

01:03:05.074 --> 01:03:06.826
You'd have a job.

01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:09.912
Working under the counter
isn't a real job.

01:03:10.037 --> 01:03:11.372
At least it's something.

01:03:11.497 --> 01:03:12.623
You open?

01:03:12.748 --> 01:03:14.292
In five minutes!

01:03:16.002 --> 01:03:18.087
You can keep it all.

01:03:21.591 --> 01:03:23.217
You interested?

01:03:25.887 --> 01:03:28.181
No, I want a real job.

01:04:25.571 --> 01:04:27.031
Is the boss in?

01:04:27.156 --> 01:04:29.367
Yeah.
In the back, in his office.

01:05:20.042 --> 01:05:22.795
I came to see
if you had any news.

01:05:23.629 --> 01:05:25.423
It's too soon.

01:05:25.631 --> 01:05:28.175
I said I'd write you.
I have your address.

01:05:28.301 --> 01:05:30.595
That's my old address.

01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:35.099
Okay.
Give me your new address.

01:05:37.351 --> 01:05:40.104
- The Grand Canyon.
- The campground?

01:05:41.063 --> 01:05:43.274
252 Route de Marche.

01:05:46.861 --> 01:05:48.863
Riquet's ripping you off.

01:05:49.864 --> 01:05:50.823
What?

01:05:50.948 --> 01:05:52.950
He's selling his own waffles.

01:05:53.743 --> 01:05:56.287
- How?
- He has a waffle iron at home.

01:05:57.705 --> 01:06:00.249
- How do you know?
- I saw it.

01:06:00.625 --> 01:06:02.877
His waffles are under the counter.

01:06:09.884 --> 01:06:13.596
- If I come, he'll know I told you.
- He'll know anyway.

01:06:41.832 --> 01:06:43.334
Hello, boss.

01:06:47.797 --> 01:06:49.757
- Where are they?
- What?

01:06:50.341 --> 01:06:52.510
Cut the crap.
Where are they?

01:06:54.679 --> 01:06:56.681
Where are your waffles?

01:06:57.098 --> 01:06:58.724
Right here.

01:07:03.854 --> 01:07:05.356
What's this?

01:07:05.981 --> 01:07:07.733
Why'd you do it?

01:07:09.527 --> 01:07:11.487
Give me your apron.

01:07:13.030 --> 01:07:14.949
Come on. Give it to me.

01:07:26.794 --> 01:07:28.295
Pick it up.

01:07:28.963 --> 01:07:30.715
You owe me three days' pay.

01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:33.342
- Go on.
- You owe me three days' pay!

01:07:34.176 --> 01:07:35.886
You gonna pick it up?

01:07:36.053 --> 01:07:37.805
Pay me my three days!

01:07:38.139 --> 01:07:40.933
Get out, you fuckin' little thief!

01:07:43.728 --> 01:07:45.396
Beat it!

01:07:55.906 --> 01:07:57.491
Put this on.

01:10:13.210 --> 01:10:14.670
Let me go!

01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:19.466
Why'd you do it?

01:10:23.429 --> 01:10:25.389
Go on, hit me!

01:10:26.515 --> 01:10:28.309
Why'd you do it?

01:10:29.018 --> 01:10:30.936
I wanted a job.

01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:46.702
Let me by.

01:10:53.584 --> 01:10:55.085
Let me by!

01:10:58.297 --> 01:11:00.382
I wasn't going to help you
out of the water!

01:11:00.507 --> 01:11:02.176
But you did!

01:11:09.767 --> 01:11:11.435
Let me by.

01:13:47.424 --> 01:13:50.344

01:14:14.118 --> 01:14:15.577

Thank you. Good-bye.

01:19:52.205 --> 01:19:53.707
Help me.

01:20:40.587 --> 01:20:42.130
Sit down.

01:23:47.357 --> 01:23:49.359
Hello. ls the boss in?

01:23:58.618 --> 01:24:00.078
This is Rosetta.

01:24:00.870 --> 01:24:03.498
I won't be coming back to work.

01:28:08.117 --> 01:28:09.786
A canister of gas.
