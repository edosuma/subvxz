Louis, since you've actually
been in the same position

03:24.237 --> 03:26.473
as a lot of these contestants
that we're gonna see tonight,

03:26.473 --> 03:28.341
how does it feel to be on
that side of the desk

03:28.341 --> 03:29.743

03:31.011 --> 03:32.546
It's--it's a little bit
intimidating.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.881
But the fact that I've got
this Golden Buzzer right here,

03:34.881 --> 03:36.016
and I genuinely...

03:37.684 --> 03:39.152

03:58.205 --> 04:00.000
I'm shaking and nervous.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.006
I'm shaking and nervous.

04:02.008 --> 04:04.411
- Hi.
Are you okay?

04:04.411 --> 04:07.247
- Yeah. Are you actually
from One Direction?

04:07.247 --> 04:08.849
- I am, yeah.
- Are you actually?

04:08.849 --> 04:11.017
- It's
legitimately me.

04:11.017 --> 04:13.386
- We really have to
step it up this time.

04:13.386 --> 04:15.222
Looking better
than the last.

04:15.222 --> 04:17.924
- It would be so awesome
to be part of the live show.

04:17.924 --> 04:19.126
Can you believe,
like...

04:19.126 --> 04:20.894
- Yeah, I can.
- from on seven spots?

04:22.629 --> 04:24.397
My name is Annie.
I'm from Canada.

04:24.397 --> 04:26.833
- My name is Andre.
I'm from Belarus.

04:26.833 --> 04:28.135
- We are
a married couple,

04:28.135 --> 04:30.000
and we do an acrobatic act
together.

04:30.000 --> 04:30.170
and we do an acrobatic act
together.

04:30.170 --> 04:33.073
- The first moment
when I saw Annie, I--

04:33.073 --> 04:36.209
just my heart
almost stop.

04:36.209 --> 04:39.112
- I could see this, like,
shy smile all the time,

04:39.112 --> 04:41.248
and I thought,
oh, this is so cute.

04:41.248 --> 04:44.050
- I proposed to Annie
after performance

04:44.050 --> 04:46.853
and I was so nervous.

04:46.853 --> 04:49.422
Tried to put ring on her finger
just because it's shaking.

04:49.422 --> 04:51.057
- Shake, mm-hmm.

04:51.057 --> 04:53.193
- And when
she say yes,

04:53.193 --> 04:56.029
I was, I think,
happiest guy in the world.

04:58.398 --> 05:00.000
It's not easy
what we're doing.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.234
It's not easy
what we're doing.

05:01.234 --> 05:03.103
It's very dangerous.

05:03.103 --> 05:04.437
A few months before
I met Andre,

05:04.437 --> 05:06.439
I had
a big accident.

05:06.439 --> 05:08.108
with another
partner.

05:08.108 --> 05:10.343
I fell 13 feet
to the ground.

05:10.343 --> 05:13.246
I broke my spine in
three different places.

05:13.246 --> 05:16.183
Every time that
I fly now,

05:16.183 --> 05:20.020
the memory of the accident
comes back to me again.

05:20.020 --> 05:23.857
Andre make me believe that
I can still do this.

05:23.857 --> 05:27.060
The first audition was
incredible.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.362
- Congratulations,
you got four yeses.

05:29.362 --> 05:30.000
You're through to
the next round.

05:30.000 --> 05:30.463
You're through to
the next round.

05:31.965 --> 05:34.668
- What we're doing tonight,
it's more dangerous

05:34.668 --> 05:37.037
than what we did in
the last performance.

05:38.238 --> 05:41.174
We have one chance
to get to the live show.

05:41.174 --> 05:44.377
- And we have to give
the performance of our life.

05:46.079 --> 05:47.280
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.882
- Hello.
- Nice to see you again.

05:48.882 --> 05:50.517
- Thank you.
- You told us last time

05:50.517 --> 05:52.452
that you broke your back
in three different places

05:52.452 --> 05:54.020
or something like that.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.922
- The more you bring it up, the
more she's gonna think about it.

05:55.922 --> 05:58.058
- Is it bad for us
to be bringing it up

05:58.058 --> 06:00.000
moments before
you're about to perform?

06:00.000 --> 06:00.060
moments before
you're about to perform?

06:00.060 --> 06:02.996
- I just need to concentrate
on what I do

06:02.996 --> 06:05.398
and put
this memory away.

06:05.398 --> 06:07.267
- Are you gonna do
something different

06:07.267 --> 06:09.469
compared to the first time
we saw you?

06:09.469 --> 06:10.971
- Completely different.

06:10.971 --> 06:14.407
There is new tricks
and a surprise. You will see.

06:14.407 --> 06:15.809
- Good. Well, I hope
you don't hurt yourself.

06:15.809 --> 06:16.877
- Good luck.
- I hope, too.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.345
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

06:23.316 --> 06:24.851
- I've never watched
anything like this.

06:31.024 --> 06:32.325
- Aw.

06:32.325 --> 06:33.560
- That's sweet.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.328
- That's so cute.

06:43.904 --> 06:44.905

06:48.942 --> 06:49.943
Oh!

06:50.977 --> 06:53.179
- No.
Oh, here we go!

06:53.179 --> 06:54.981

07:39.426 --> 07:41.428
This is crazy.

07:45.432 --> 07:48.268
- Oh, oh, oh,
I can't do this.

07:48.268 --> 07:50.103
I can't watch. I can't watch.
I can't watch.

07:50.103 --> 07:52.706

07:52.706 --> 07:54.341

incredible.

10:31.331 --> 10:32.732
- Well, how old are you?
- 24.

10:32.732 --> 10:34.934
- I had my first one
at 22.

10:34.934 --> 10:36.302
- Yeah. Like to be
a young parent,

10:36.302 --> 10:38.204
I'm super, super excited
about that.

10:38.204 --> 10:39.305
- Here we go.

10:39.305 --> 10:40.707
- Time to get out there,
have a good time.

10:40.707 --> 10:41.708
- All right,
thank you.

10:41.708 --> 10:42.709
- All right.

10:47.347 --> 10:48.715
- Hi, Campbell.

10:48.715 --> 10:49.953
- Hi. How are you?
- I'm very good.

10:49.953 --> 10:50.183
- Hi. How are you?
- I'm very good.

10:50.183 --> 10:51.618
Remind us
how old you are.

10:51.618 --> 10:53.019
- I'm 14 years old.

10:53.019 --> 10:54.621
- You're 14.

10:54.621 --> 10:55.855
Tell us a little bit

10:55.855 --> 10:57.490
about what you're gonna
perform for us today.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.759
- I chose a song 'cause
it's really personal to me.

10:59.759 --> 11:03.129
The lyrics just really reflect
about how I feel about my mom

11:03.129 --> 11:05.732
and how I've just always wanted
to, you know, just meet her

11:05.732 --> 11:07.867
and she's always just been
waiting there for me.

11:09.169 --> 11:12.138
I would never be here

11:12.138 --> 11:14.007
and I would never have
this opportunity

11:14.007 --> 11:16.976
if my dads
hadn't adopted me.

11:16.976 --> 11:18.511
Since I was adopted
at birth,

11:18.511 --> 11:19.953
my norm was just having
two dads.

11:19.953 --> 11:20.914
my norm was just having
two dads.

11:20.914 --> 11:23.349
I got bullied a lot

11:23.349 --> 11:26.853
just because of my family
and how it's constructed.

11:26.853 --> 11:30.256
Kids would ask me,
"Where's your mom?"

11:30.256 --> 11:32.759
And I'd just, like,
think to myself,

11:32.759 --> 11:34.594
you know, where is my mom,
who is my mom?

11:36.729 --> 11:39.832
When I was 10 or 11 is when
I really started asking my dads

11:39.832 --> 11:41.301
about my mom.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.770
- She wanted a better life
for Campbell.

11:43.770 --> 11:45.672
She was raising
three other children

11:45.672 --> 11:47.740
and couldn't afford
to have another.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.377
- I'm actually
really thankful

11:51.377 --> 11:53.246
that she gave me up
for adoption, you know,

11:53.246 --> 11:55.481
so I didn't have to struggle
like that.

11:55.481 --> 11:59.018
My dads have done
so much for me.

11:59.018 --> 12:02.622
- Campbell really wants her
to be proud of her choice.

12:02.622 --> 12:05.191
And so I think a lot of
his drive for success

12:05.191 --> 12:07.961
comes from his desire
to make her happy.

12:07.961 --> 12:10.129
I'm just emotional

12:10.129 --> 12:13.366
because I know how much Campbell
wants her to be proud of him.

12:13.366 --> 12:15.602
- I'm following
my dreams,

12:15.602 --> 12:18.338
and I'm able to do that
because of what she did.

12:18.338 --> 12:19.953
- And so have you ever actually
met your birth mother?

12:19.953 --> 12:21.741
- And so have you ever actually
met your birth mother?

12:21.741 --> 12:24.577
- No,
I have not.

12:24.577 --> 12:25.645
- Oh, he's sweet.

12:25.645 --> 12:27.113
- Aw.

12:27.113 --> 12:28.615
- Aw.

12:31.684 --> 12:35.121
- Well, Campbell,
you're fully prepared,

12:35.121 --> 12:37.390
ease into this,
and enjoy yourself.

12:37.390 --> 12:38.391
Good luck.
- Thank you.

12:39.926 --> 12:43.396
- You can do it,
Campbell.

14:31.170 --> 14:32.705
- Heidi, what did
you think?

14:32.705 --> 14:36.008
- You make me emotional, and I
don't get emotional at all.

14:36.008 --> 14:37.076
I have to tell you.

14:37.076 --> 14:38.611
You know,
it wasn't perfect.

14:38.611 --> 14:39.979
There were a lot of mistakes
here and there,

14:39.979 --> 14:41.414
but I have to say,

14:41.414 --> 14:44.083
I felt every word that you were
singing, I really did.

14:44.083 --> 14:46.886
- Louis.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.288
- I was 18 when I first
auditioned for "The X Factor,"

14:49.288 --> 14:49.953
and let me
tell you now,

14:49.953 --> 14:50.690
and let me
tell you now,

14:50.690 --> 14:53.559
it was the most intimidating,
scary moment of my life

14:53.559 --> 14:55.061
still to this day.

14:55.061 --> 14:58.531
So what you have just done there
at 14 is incredible.

14:58.531 --> 14:59.866
- Thank you, sir.

14:59.866 --> 15:00.967
- You did a great job.
- Thank you.

15:00.967 --> 15:02.835
- Simon.

15:02.835 --> 15:06.339
- I absolutely felt every word,
every lyric.

15:06.339 --> 15:07.673
I understood what
you were singing about.

15:07.673 --> 15:08.908
- Thank you.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.411
- And that's hard.

15:11.411 --> 15:14.180
There were some--
some issues with the tuning,

15:14.180 --> 15:16.048
but then other times

15:16.048 --> 15:18.785
I could hear this beautiful tone
in your voice as well.

15:18.785 --> 15:19.953

it'll make her proud.

So for me,
it's a no.

19:44.784 --> 19:46.585

the big dogs now,

19:46.585 --> 19:47.720
by we have to
step it up.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.155

Outlawz?

19:49.155 --> 19:51.490
- Outlawz, yeah.

19:51.490 --> 19:52.792
- We know
we're the underdogs,

19:52.792 --> 19:54.760
so we have to go out
and step up our game.

19:55.828 --> 19:57.496
- Outlawz.

19:57.496 --> 19:58.597
Hi,
how are you doing?

19:58.597 --> 19:59.799
- We're doing good.

19:59.799 --> 20:01.934
- You did get criticized
a little bit last time.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.536
- By you.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.337
- Well, I gave you
a no.

20:05.337 --> 20:05.928
So what did you do
to pump up your game?

20:05.928 --> 20:07.707
So what did you do
to pump up your game?

20:07.707 --> 20:09.308
- We took your criticism
to heart.

20:09.308 --> 20:12.645
We actually
went back and--

20:12.645 --> 20:15.081
we--we went back and redid
some of our stuff

20:15.081 --> 20:16.682
and--and put that
into effect.

20:16.682 --> 20:19.151
- You look a bit nervous
tonight.

20:19.151 --> 20:21.220
Okay, well look,
everyone's upped there game,

20:21.220 --> 20:22.621

21:47.373 --> 21:50.409

setting it off!

21:52.144 --> 21:53.312
- So good, yeah.

21:53.312 --> 21:57.316
- You guys stepped it up.
You really did.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.084
- Thank you.

21:59.084 --> 22:01.954
- You did,
from last time.

22:01.954 --> 22:03.622
I'm really happy.

22:03.622 --> 22:05.024
Howie,
what did you think?

22:05.024 --> 22:05.928
- You know, when you're at
this stage in our show,

22:05.928 --> 22:07.526
- You know, when you're at
this stage in our show,

22:07.526 --> 22:09.128
we expect greatness.

22:09.128 --> 22:12.164
It was everything
you needed it to be.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.699
I loved it.

22:13.699 --> 22:15.334
- Thank you
so much.

22:15.334 --> 22:16.602
- That makes me
nervous.

22:16.602 --> 22:17.937
- Yeah.

22:17.937 --> 22:20.840
- I did see a few
little mistakes here and there,

22:20.840 --> 22:23.876
but overall, that was
really, really good.

22:23.876 --> 22:25.010
Really good.
- Thank you.

22:26.111 --> 22:27.947
- Louis,
what about you?

22:27.947 --> 22:30.216
- I am probably
the least qualified person

22:30.216 --> 22:31.617
to talk about dancing.

22:31.617 --> 22:34.086
Now, we have one rule,
one rule in One Direction,

22:34.086 --> 22:35.721
it was to never dance,
'cause we are all,

22:35.721 --> 22:35.928
me in particular,
horrific dancers.

22:35.928 --> 22:38.791
me in particular,
horrific dancers.

22:38.791 --> 22:40.926
So I take my hat off to you.
Well done.

22:40.926 --> 22:43.395
- Thank you
so much.

22:43.395 --> 22:44.763
- Simon.

22:44.763 --> 22:47.433
- You know, I liked you from
the very first time I met you.

22:47.433 --> 22:50.102
And--and part of the reason
I like you so much is,

22:50.102 --> 22:51.737
is that a lot of
the dance groups

22:51.737 --> 22:53.105
that we have
on these shows

22:53.105 --> 22:55.574
they can be
very anonymous.

22:55.574 --> 22:58.878
But with you guys, I can tell
that you're friends,

22:58.878 --> 23:02.882
and your imperfections is what
made it almost more likeable,

23:02.882 --> 23:04.383
what you do.

23:04.383 --> 23:05.928
You did good, guys.
We'll see you later.

is so beautiful.

29:51.690 --> 29:53.225
- Thank you.

29:53.225 --> 29:54.893
- I mean, I don't--I don't even
know how anyone can do that,

29:54.893 --> 29:57.462
sing and then smile
at the same time.

29:57.462 --> 29:59.264
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

29:59.264 --> 30:01.767
- Mel.

30:01.767 --> 30:03.869
- I think you're just
a natural.

30:03.869 --> 30:05.203
You are meant
to sing.

30:05.203 --> 30:06.972
- Thank you
so much.

30:06.972 --> 30:08.206
- Simon.

30:08.206 --> 30:09.952
- You, young lady,

30:09.952 --> 30:10.242
- You, young lady,

30:10.242 --> 30:13.612
have just turned this
competition upside down.

30:20.252 --> 30:21.987
- Louis.

30:21.987 --> 30:25.123
- It's not just one thing
with you.

30:25.123 --> 30:27.359
It's not just the voice.
It's not just the performance.

30:27.359 --> 30:29.328
You have everything,
and it's so infectious...

30:29.328 --> 30:31.029
- Thank you.
- To watch your performance.

30:33.865 --> 30:35.834
So...

30:35.834 --> 30:36.835
- Oh, my gosh.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.337
Oh! Oh!

30:44.676 --> 30:45.711
- Aww, whatever.

for a 14 year old,

31:38.230 --> 31:39.952
such a gorgeous
recording voice.

31:39.952 --> 31:40.665
such a gorgeous
recording voice.

31:40.665 --> 31:43.201
You should be very excited,
very excited.

31:43.201 --> 31:45.103

Everyone make some noise

31:54.346 --> 31:56.314
- Oh, goodness,

31:56.314 --> 31:57.783

I was actually taken aback

32:11.263 --> 32:13.131
by the emotion,
especially seeing her mom.

32:13.131 --> 32:14.699
'Cause I can relate that
to my mom.

32:14.699 --> 32:16.268
Seeing my mom get all cheery

32:36.955 --> 32:38.757
And I'm 82.

32:38.757 --> 32:40.158
- Oh, my.

32:40.158 --> 32:42.861
- I'm John Hetlinger,
and I like singing loud

32:42.861 --> 32:44.095
and entertaining.

32:44.095 --> 32:46.598
- My name is
Nathan Bockstahler,

32:46.598 --> 32:48.166
and I am a comedian.

32:48.166 --> 32:51.503
- I started singing and
performing about 25 years ago.

32:51.503 --> 32:53.638
I always kind of liked
the attention.

32:53.638 --> 32:57.909
- I first did comedy
at a school talent show,

32:57.909 --> 33:00.245
and they laughed
really hard.

33:00.245 --> 33:02.017
- The love of my life,
of course, is my wife Marcy.

33:02.017 --> 33:03.348
- The love of my life,
of course, is my wife Marcy.

33:03.348 --> 33:06.718
She's very supportive
and my greatest fan.

33:06.718 --> 33:09.254
- I've kissed a girl once
when I was four.

33:10.555 --> 33:12.090
It was
so embarrassing.

33:12.090 --> 33:16.695
I just want that memory
to get out of my mind.

33:16.695 --> 33:19.397
- In my neighborhood,

33:19.397 --> 33:21.099
people stop me
on the street

33:21.099 --> 33:23.201
and want a selfie
with me

33:23.201 --> 33:24.936
just like
a rock star.

33:24.936 --> 33:26.238
- At school,

33:26.238 --> 33:28.039
everybody wants
an autograph,

33:28.039 --> 33:29.774
everybody wants
a selfie.

33:29.774 --> 33:31.710
We love you, Nathan!

33:31.710 --> 33:32.017
- Being a celebrity
can get tiring.

33:32.017 --> 33:34.579
- Being a celebrity
can get tiring.

33:34.579 --> 33:36.248
- You think they're gonna
pick a young guy

33:36.248 --> 33:39.217
or an old guy to go through
to the live shows?

33:39.217 --> 33:41.453
- I don't know.

33:41.453 --> 33:42.787
- I don't know
either.

33:45.123 --> 33:46.324
- Oh, I love
this guy.

33:46.324 --> 33:48.326
- Thank you.
Thank you.

33:51.696 --> 33:52.998
- Hello, John.

33:52.998 --> 33:55.500
It's great
to see you again.

33:55.500 --> 33:57.402
- It's good to
be back.

33:57.402 --> 33:58.770
- John,
are you married?

33:58.770 --> 34:01.306
- Yes, I am.
I have a lovely young wife.

34:01.306 --> 34:02.017
- Whoa, young.

34:02.017 --> 34:02.908
- Whoa, young.

34:02.908 --> 34:03.909
- How old is she?

34:03.909 --> 34:05.744
- She is 63.

34:05.744 --> 34:07.779
- Wow, okay.
- Whoa!

34:07.779 --> 34:10.815
- Just tell me what winning this
would mean for you.

34:10.815 --> 34:14.052
- I've had a lot of exciting
things in my many years,

34:14.052 --> 34:16.221
but this would be
top of the list.

34:16.221 --> 34:18.390
- He's sweet.

34:18.390 --> 34:20.525
- Best of luck, John,
'cause I really like you.

34:20.525 --> 34:23.128
- All right,
thank you very much.

34:23.128 --> 34:24.629
- Oh, he's taking
the glasses off.

34:24.629 --> 34:26.331
- He's taking the glasses off.
- That's amazing.

34:26.331 --> 34:28.300
I love that.

- Whoo!

35:25.023 --> 35:29.194
- I didn't know an old man
could be so wild.

35:29.194 --> 35:31.329
- John,

35:31.329 --> 35:32.017
I'm not really sure
what I've just seen,

35:32.017 --> 35:33.431
I'm not really sure
what I've just seen,

35:33.431 --> 35:36.334
but I really hope that
I look like you when I'm 82.

35:36.334 --> 35:38.136
- I do, too.

35:39.137 --> 35:40.405
- With all due respect,

35:40.405 --> 35:42.407
you know, I just can't detect
your talent.

35:43.608 --> 35:45.644
I'm really sorry,
but I have to be honest.

35:45.644 --> 35:48.913
- John,
I have never seen

35:48.913 --> 35:50.482
or heard an act
like you...

35:50.482 --> 35:51.683
- There's a reason
for it.

35:51.683 --> 35:52.917
- In all the years
I've been doing this.

35:52.917 --> 35:54.619
- There is a reason
for it.

35:56.087 --> 35:58.890
- I am going to fight for you
to go into the finals.

35:58.890 --> 36:01.026
- Thank you
very much.

36:01.026 --> 36:02.017
- Well done, John.

36:02.017 --> 36:02.394
- Well done, John.

36:04.863 --> 36:06.164
- He's fantastic.

36:06.164 --> 36:07.298
- Bless him.

36:07.298 --> 36:09.034
- I love him.

36:09.034 --> 36:12.037
- Are you nervous at all about
being the youngest person here?

36:12.037 --> 36:13.538
- I'm actually
excited.

36:13.538 --> 36:15.840
I want to make it to
the live shows

36:15.840 --> 36:20.211
so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so,
so, so, so, so, so, so badly.

36:22.814 --> 36:25.316
- Oh, my God!

36:25.316 --> 36:26.718
- I know.

36:26.718 --> 36:28.353
- I can't take it.

36:28.353 --> 36:29.621
- Hey, guys.

36:29.621 --> 36:30.989
- Hi.
- I like him.

36:30.989 --> 36:32.017
- Hey, Louis,
One Direction is awesome.

36:32.017 --> 36:33.992
- Hey, Louis,
One Direction is awesome.

36:33.992 --> 36:35.660
- Oh,
that's really sweet.

36:35.660 --> 36:38.763
- Okay, Nathan...

36:38.763 --> 36:42.033
you were brilliant
last time we saw you,

36:42.033 --> 36:43.201
so good luck.

36:43.201 --> 36:45.270
- Okay.

36:45.270 --> 36:46.604
- I can't believe
we're competing

36:46.604 --> 36:47.806
against a six year old.

36:47.806 --> 36:51.376
- Did you guys know that
parents tell lies?

36:51.376 --> 36:53.011
- No.

36:53.011 --> 36:56.181
- Last year, my dad
tried to convince me

36:56.181 --> 36:58.683
that Santa wanted
beer and chips

36:58.683 --> 37:00.819
instead of
milk and cookies.

37:03.288 --> 37:04.556
I told him,

37:04.556 --> 37:07.425
how gullible
do you think I am?

37:09.561 --> 37:10.962
- Cute kid.

37:10.962 --> 37:14.699
- Whenever my mom is
eating something

37:14.699 --> 37:18.436
that looks delicious
and I ask for a bite,

37:18.436 --> 37:22.273
it always happens to be
"spicy."

37:24.642 --> 37:26.211
- That's funny.

37:26.211 --> 37:27.445
I say that
to my kids.

37:27.445 --> 37:29.714
- Come on, Mom.

37:29.714 --> 37:32.017
When has anyone
ever heard

37:32.017 --> 37:32.150
When has anyone
ever heard

37:32.150 --> 37:35.019
of a spicy
Girl Scout cookie?

37:38.990 --> 37:40.925
At least there's
one thing

37:40.925 --> 37:42.994
I always know
is true.

37:42.994 --> 37:46.097
If you're cute,
like me,

37:46.097 --> 37:49.534
you can get away with
just about...

37:49.534 --> 37:51.536
anything.

37:53.338 --> 37:55.039
Right,
Mel and Heidi?

37:55.039 --> 37:57.142
- Mm-hmm.

37:58.209 --> 38:00.378
- Thank you. Thank you.
You guys rock!

38:03.848 --> 38:05.984
- Hittin' on Heidi
and Mel B.

38:05.984 --> 38:07.685
Smart move.

38:09.821 --> 38:13.057
- You are just as cute
as a button, aren't you?

38:13.057 --> 38:15.059
If you do go through to
the next round,

38:15.059 --> 38:16.461
practice.

38:16.461 --> 38:19.297
You were trying to remember
what was coming next

38:19.297 --> 38:20.465
just a little bit.

38:20.465 --> 38:23.034
- I'm sorry,
but I didn't.

38:23.034 --> 38:24.903
- Ooh.

38:24.903 --> 38:27.305
I like it.

38:27.305 --> 38:28.573
- Oh, I love you,
Nathan.

38:29.808 --> 38:32.017
- You are so adorable
and so cute,

38:32.017 --> 38:32.310
- You are so adorable
and so cute,

38:32.310 --> 38:34.712
and I'm
the same way.

38:34.712 --> 38:36.181
Millions of people
love me

38:36.181 --> 38:37.582
because I'm
just gorgeous

38:37.582 --> 38:40.018
and I'm adorable.

38:40.018 --> 38:41.853
- You're kidding,
right?

38:41.853 --> 38:44.022
- Hello!

38:44.022 --> 38:46.157
- What?

38:48.193 --> 38:49.594
- That was funny.

38:49.594 --> 38:51.396
- That was good.

38:51.396 --> 38:53.665
- Nathan, I just want to be
your best friend.

38:53.665 --> 38:56.334
I remember being younger
and at school

38:56.334 --> 38:58.002
and just think--trying to think
of smart comments

38:59.537 --> 39:02.017
But you are just so quick that
they come one after the other.

39:02.017 --> 39:02.774
But you are just so quick that

39:02.774 --> 39:05.710
You are the coolest
six year old

39:05.710 --> 39:07.612
I have ever met.

39:07.612 --> 39:11.349
- I think you are gonna be
a little movie star.

39:12.884 --> 39:15.286
You and I can
take over the world.

39:15.286 --> 39:16.754
- Oh, yeah!

39:16.754 --> 39:20.258
Let's get some money in
our piggy banks.

39:20.258 --> 39:21.960
- Lets!

39:24.062 --> 39:27.999
- Well done, Nathan.

39:27.999 --> 39:30.835
- Good job,
Nathan!

39:30.835 --> 39:32.017
- Oh, he was cute.

39:32.017 --> 39:32.871
- Oh, he was cute.

39:32.871 --> 39:34.305
- How'd it go, man?

39:34.305 --> 39:36.241
- It was awesome.

39:36.241 --> 39:38.042
- What's up, buddy?
Yeah, you did so good!

39:38.042 --> 39:39.244

39:39.244 --> 39:40.612
Yeah!

39:40.612 --> 39:42.614

or what, man?

39:42.614 --> 39:44.315
- You killed it,
buddy.

39:44.315 --> 39:47.051
- Honestly, I sat watching the
six-year-old comedian, right?

39:47.051 --> 39:48.486
When I was six,

39:48.486 --> 39:50.321
all I could do was
fart with my armpit,

39:50.321 --> 39:51.923
and that's about it.
- Let's hear it.

39:51.923 --> 39:53.124
- Can you
do it now?

39:53.124 --> 39:54.125

I'm 45,

40:22.120 --> 40:23.955
I was born
in Ukraine.

40:23.955 --> 40:25.790
In the family we grew up,
it's my mom,

40:25.790 --> 40:27.091
my older brother,
and I.

40:27.091 --> 40:28.626
Even though we are
small family,

40:28.626 --> 40:31.462
but we are
three big hearts.

40:31.462 --> 40:34.632
My brother is the reason
that I juggle.

40:34.632 --> 40:35.069
He is actually the one that
snuck me out

40:35.069 --> 40:36.668
He is actually the one that
snuck me out

40:36.668 --> 40:37.969
from the kindergarten

40:37.969 --> 40:40.939
and brought me to
a juggling studio.

40:40.939 --> 40:44.242
My first audition was
just amazing.

40:44.242 --> 40:45.310

four yeses.

40:45.310 --> 40:46.477
- Thank you.

40:47.645 --> 40:50.081
A few days after
my first audition

40:50.081 --> 40:52.417
my brother had
a heart attack,

40:52.417 --> 40:55.486

41:12.337 --> 41:14.472
that I will compete
in the second round.

41:14.472 --> 41:18.276
And my mom said,
"Of course, you have to do it.

41:18.276 --> 41:20.812

fantastic.

You really are, and it's your
emotion and it's your heart.

to your performance.

45:21.285 --> 45:24.388
It just makes it riveting
and so, so exciting to watch.

45:24.388 --> 45:26.390
I mean, I'm not
a massive juggling fan,

45:26.390 --> 45:28.526
but I was captivated
from the minute go.

45:28.526 --> 45:30.094
It was really,
really exciting.

because last time,

55:29.393 --> 55:31.895
you know, we were
pretty nervous.

55:31.895 --> 55:34.665
- And--and can you tell us just

55:55.452 --> 55:57.821
- And these kids are afraid
to even come to school.

55:57.821 --> 56:00.424

1:00:04.634 --> 1:00:06.403
What did you think
of that?

1:00:06.403 --> 1:00:08.008
- It's incredible
to watch you guys perform.

1:00:08.008 --> 1:00:09.639
- It's incredible
to watch you guys perform.

1:00:11.475 --> 1:00:14.077
The unity and the love you have
for each other

1:00:14.077 --> 1:00:15.745
is so infectious.

1:00:15.745 --> 1:00:16.980
It was really,
really nice.

1:00:21.918 --> 1:00:25.388
- You as the director,
you give this to the kids.

1:00:25.388 --> 1:00:28.959
All over America,
our arts programs are being cut.

1:00:28.959 --> 1:00:32.362
- Ours has been cut down
smaller and smaller,

1:00:32.362 --> 1:00:34.898
and we're just fighting
to keep it.

1:00:34.898 --> 1:00:38.008
- I love what I hear,
and it's beautiful.

1:00:38.008 --> 1:00:38.568
- I love what I hear,
and it's beautiful.

1:00:38.568 --> 1:00:40.303
- Thank you.

1:00:43.140 --> 1:00:45.909
- I mean, I love everything
about you guys.

1:00:45.909 --> 1:00:47.410
I love what
you stand for.

1:00:47.410 --> 1:00:49.146
I love what
you do,

1:00:49.146 --> 1:00:51.548
and I am gonna be
rooting for you, too.

1:00:51.548 --> 1:00:54.151
- Thank you.
Thank you.

1:00:58.321 --> 1:01:01.024
- Tell me
what it would mean

1:01:01.024 --> 1:01:02.626
getting into
the finals.

1:01:02.626 --> 1:01:05.629
- It would mean...

1:01:05.629 --> 1:01:07.931
that hope is alive

1:01:07.931 --> 1:01:08.008
for urban youth

to decide who is
going through.

1:02:01.184 --> 1:02:03.520

to follow.

1:03:42.285 --> 1:03:45.188

to be working with me?

1:03:45.188 --> 1:03:47.223

1:03:54.764 --> 1:03:56.533
- Ladies and gentlemen,

1:03:56.533 --> 1:03:58.935
I am
The Baron of The Universe.

1:03:58.935 --> 1:04:03.907
I am from Las Vegas, Nevada,
the city of dreams.

1:04:03.907 --> 1:04:05.018
I am slightly different kind of
a strongman.

1:04:05.018 --> 1:04:06.876
I am slightly different kind of

1:04:11.481 --> 1:04:13.283
- Oh, no!

1:04:13.283 --> 1:04:15.118
- I kind of wanted to see
more of you

1:04:15.118 --> 1:04:17.654
because you're
fantastically sick.

1:04:20.724 --> 1:04:24.194
- Tonight, I'm bringing in
a secret weapon,

1:04:24.194 --> 1:04:27.397
Miss LouLou D'vil,
my girlfriend.

1:04:27.397 --> 1:04:29.899
The competition is
real intense.

1:04:29.899 --> 1:04:34.037
I'm pushing the limits even more
than I have done before.

1:04:34.037 --> 1:04:35.018
I am The Baron,
and I am ready to rumble.

1:04:35.018 --> 1:04:38.308
I am The Baron,

1:04:40.810 --> 1:04:42.812

1:04:42.812 --> 1:04:45.482
- Remember Baron?

1:04:45.482 --> 1:04:47.150
- I'm really squeamish with
this type of thing.

1:04:47.150 --> 1:04:49.686
- It's good to have you back,
Baron of The Universe.

1:04:49.686 --> 1:04:50.787
- Thank you
very much.

1:04:50.787 --> 1:04:52.288
- You dazzled us
last time

1:04:52.288 --> 1:04:57.026
with some kind of gross
yet weird stunts.

1:04:57.026 --> 1:04:58.962
And you made us
some promises

1:04:58.962 --> 1:05:00.864
that you were even
gonna go further

1:05:00.864 --> 1:05:02.665
- Oh, yes indeed.

1:05:02.665 --> 1:05:05.018
- How risky is
what you're going to do?

1:05:05.018 --> 1:05:06.436
- How risky is
what you're going to do?

1:05:06.436 --> 1:05:08.238
What's the worst thing that
could happen?

1:05:08.238 --> 1:05:10.240
- The worst thing that
can happen

1:05:10.240 --> 1:05:12.809
is a massive pool of blood
here onstage...

1:05:14.110 --> 1:05:15.578
where my nipples will
rip off.

1:05:15.578 --> 1:05:17.814
- Oh, my gosh!

1:05:17.814 --> 1:05:19.215
That makes mine sore.
- You're telling me

1:05:19.215 --> 1:05:21.451
that you could lose
your nipples.

1:05:21.451 --> 1:05:23.286
- Yes, sir.

1:05:23.286 --> 1:05:24.721
- Okay, good luck.
- Thank you.

1:05:24.721 --> 1:05:28.391

1:06:35.825 --> 1:06:37.393
Baron of The Universe.

1:06:37.393 --> 1:06:38.528
- Wow.

1:06:38.528 --> 1:06:40.463
- My nipples are sore
watching you.

1:06:40.463 --> 1:06:41.631
- Yeah.
- Genuinely.

1:06:41.631 --> 1:06:42.699
And that's not
a joke.

1:06:42.699 --> 1:06:44.067
- Thank you.
I appreciate that.

1:06:46.102 --> 1:06:48.171
- There is an audience for this,
there is.

1:06:48.171 --> 1:06:49.806
- Yeah.
- The sideshows,

1:06:49.806 --> 1:06:52.242
old--old Americana,
people want to watch it.

1:06:52.242 --> 1:06:53.510
- I do.
- Yeah.

1:06:53.510 --> 1:06:54.777
- Thank you
very much.

1:06:55.812 --> 1:06:57.580
- Heidi.

1:06:57.580 --> 1:07:00.149
- It's just--it makes me
almost like gag a little bit.

1:07:00.149 --> 1:07:02.085
And nothing personal,
it's just not my--

1:07:02.085 --> 1:07:03.520
- So it's not personal.
- It's not my cup of tea.

1:07:03.520 --> 1:07:05.018
I can't see
this kind of stuff.

1:07:05.018 --> 1:07:05.755
I can't see
this kind of stuff.

1:07:05.755 --> 1:07:08.658
- This is the time where
it has to be stepped up,

1:07:08.658 --> 1:07:10.493
and you did.

1:07:10.493 --> 1:07:12.662
I could see something like this
in Vegas,

1:07:12.662 --> 1:07:15.765
and you offer
valet parking

1:07:15.765 --> 1:07:17.567
where you do--

1:07:17.567 --> 1:07:20.236
People leave their car
in front of the theater,

1:07:20.236 --> 1:07:24.107
and you bring it into
the parking areola.

1:07:27.977 --> 1:07:30.580
- Well, I have to ask you first
of all, how are your nipples?

1:07:30.580 --> 1:07:32.215
- Actually,
very good.

1:07:32.215 --> 1:07:33.550
- Okay.
- They're absolutely fine.

1:07:33.550 --> 1:07:35.018
- I've never asked a man
that question before.

1:07:35.018 --> 1:07:35.318
- I've never asked a man
that question before.

1:07:36.419 --> 1:07:38.521
Look, you fascinate me,
actually.

1:07:38.521 --> 1:07:40.290
Compared to some of the stuff
I've seen tonight,

1:07:40.290 --> 1:07:42.158
I want to see you
again.

1:07:42.158 --> 1:07:43.326
- Thank you
very much.

1:07:43.326 --> 1:07:44.827
Have a good night,
guys.

1:07:44.827 --> 1:07:46.129
Thank you.

1:07:48.097 --> 1:07:49.766
- I mean,
that was crazy.

1:07:49.766 --> 1:07:51.834
He could be the person
who could win

1:07:51.834 --> 1:07:53.102
who you don't
expect.

1:07:53.102 --> 1:07:54.137
- My nipples
still hurt,

1:07:54.137 --> 1:07:56.406
along with everybody
else in here,

1:07:56.406 --> 1:07:57.674
but great job.

1:07:57.674 --> 1:07:58.775
- Thank you
very much, Nick.

1:07:58.775 --> 1:08:00.376
- I could bet you
right now

1:08:00.376 --> 1:08:02.145
that they will not
go through later.

1:08:02.145 --> 1:08:03.813
- Don't be so cynical.
- I don't know.

1:08:03.813 --> 1:08:05.018
- I'm being serious.

1:08:05.018 --> 1:08:05.381
- I'm being serious.

1:08:07.517 --> 1:08:09.886
- We will do
the impossible.

1:08:09.886 --> 1:08:12.021
- The first number
is an eight.

1:08:12.021 --> 1:08:15.291
- Unfortunately, there are only
seven slots available.

1:08:15.291 --> 1:08:18.328
- The choice
we have made is...

1:08:23.933 --> 1:08:26.069
- I wear a hearing aid.
I have a hearing disability.

1:08:26.069 --> 1:08:27.570
They're not
waterproof.

1:08:27.570 --> 1:08:30.907
I gotta take my hearing aids out
when I go swimming.

1:08:30.907 --> 1:08:32.642
So pool parties are
a nightmare, right?

1:08:34.677 --> 1:08:36.746
Not very good at the game
Marco Polo.

1:08:37.947 --> 1:08:40.016
There's not a whole lot of
Polo happening

1:08:40.016 --> 1:08:41.284
when I'm playing
that game

1:08:41.284 --> 1:08:43.286
but lots of Marco.

1:08:44.287 --> 1:08:45.488
- That was funny.

1:08:45.488 --> 1:08:47.357
- Thank you,
everybody.

1:08:47.357 --> 1:08:49.425
- You seemed comfortable.
I really enjoyed it.

1:08:49.425 --> 1:08:50.593
- I think
it was great.

1:08:50.593 --> 1:08:50.964
- That's big
competition.

1:08:50.964 --> 1:08:53.096
- That's big
competition.

1:08:53.096 --> 1:08:55.064
- Does it make you nervous?
- A little bit.

1:08:55.064 --> 1:08:56.766
They're all so good.
- Yeah.

1:08:56.766 --> 1:08:58.568
- I think you're
super, super talented.

1:08:58.568 --> 1:08:59.836
I think you have
great potential.

1:08:59.836 --> 1:09:01.237
- Ooh.

1:09:01.237 --> 1:09:05.274
- Wow, that's all
I can say.

1:09:05.274 --> 1:09:07.043
- I don't know.
It was better.

1:09:07.043 --> 1:09:10.446
I'm not 100% sure this time,
I'm afraid. Sorry.

1:09:10.446 --> 1:09:12.148
Oh.

1:09:12.148 --> 1:09:13.783
- That's weird.

1:09:15.318 --> 1:09:16.452
- I'm Thommy Ten.

1:09:16.452 --> 1:09:17.720
- I'm
Amélie van Tass.

1:09:17.720 --> 1:09:19.989
Together we are
The Clairvoyants.

1:09:19.989 --> 1:09:20.964
- Amélie is unlike
any other woman.

1:09:20.964 --> 1:09:22.158
- Amélie is unlike
any other woman.

1:09:22.158 --> 1:09:23.860
She is
really special.

1:09:23.860 --> 1:09:26.396
- ♪ La la-la-la la ♪

1:09:26.396 --> 1:09:30.400
- Amélie is actually the only
female clairvoyant in the world.

1:09:30.400 --> 1:09:32.068
- When I was
a little girl,

1:09:32.068 --> 1:09:34.203
I just knew I was
a little different.

1:09:35.938 --> 1:09:38.641
Sometimes people
are afraid.

1:09:38.641 --> 1:09:40.209
I have
very strong intuition.

1:09:40.209 --> 1:09:44.414
I could sense people's
feelings from far away.

1:09:46.249 --> 1:09:47.784
As soon as we met,

1:09:47.784 --> 1:09:50.019
we knew that there was
a very special connection.

1:09:51.821 --> 1:09:53.122
- When we started
to date,

1:09:53.122 --> 1:09:55.224
unusual things
started to happen.

1:09:55.224 --> 1:09:58.027
- I could sense details
on objects

1:09:58.027 --> 1:09:59.762
that he was holding
in his hands,

1:09:59.762 --> 1:10:02.432
even though Thommy wasn't
in the same room.

1:10:02.432 --> 1:10:03.933
There is an object
in your hand

1:10:03.933 --> 1:10:04.967
those are eyedrops.

1:10:04.967 --> 1:10:06.035
- That is correct?

1:10:06.035 --> 1:10:07.437
- That is
absolutely correct.

1:10:07.437 --> 1:10:09.639
It's the most amazing thing
I've ever seen

1:10:09.639 --> 1:10:11.374
on "America's Got Talent."

1:10:11.374 --> 1:10:12.608
- Since our
first audition,

1:10:12.608 --> 1:10:15.144
we worked our connection
more and more.

1:10:15.144 --> 1:10:17.547
And this time we're
bringing on a new level.

1:10:17.547 --> 1:10:18.948
You ready?
- Yes.

1:10:18.948 --> 1:10:20.750
Going to
the live shows

1:10:20.750 --> 1:10:20.964
is everything
we've dreamed of.

1:10:20.964 --> 1:10:23.653
is everything
we've dreamed of.

1:10:23.653 --> 1:10:27.356
This has to be
our best performance yet.

1:10:29.759 --> 1:10:31.894
- I love
this couple.

1:10:31.894 --> 1:10:33.129
Good evening,
Clairvoyants.

1:10:33.129 --> 1:10:35.098
- Hello.

1:10:35.098 --> 1:10:36.332
- You were great
the first time,

1:10:36.332 --> 1:10:39.235
and I've never been
this amazed by anything.

1:10:39.235 --> 1:10:40.403
- Yeah.
- You scare me.

1:10:42.472 --> 1:10:44.941
Do you believe you have
something equal,

1:10:44.941 --> 1:10:46.342
if not better,
tonight?

1:10:46.342 --> 1:10:48.478
- I believe so.

1:10:48.478 --> 1:10:49.479
- All right,
dazzle me again.

1:10:49.479 --> 1:10:50.964
- Let's do it.

1:10:50.964 --> 1:10:51.047
- Let's do it.

1:10:51.047 --> 1:10:53.249
Simon, the last time,
you said

1:10:53.249 --> 1:10:54.951
you would love to spend the
weekend with us in Vegas, right?

1:10:54.951 --> 1:10:56.652
- Yes.

1:10:56.652 --> 1:10:59.388
- And we thought we'll bring
Las Vegas to you.

1:10:59.388 --> 1:11:00.790
- Ooh.

1:11:00.790 --> 1:11:04.627
- We want to show you something
we have no influence on.

1:11:04.627 --> 1:11:06.362
A game of chance.

1:11:06.362 --> 1:11:08.998
- We need three things
we'll find in Vegas,

1:11:08.998 --> 1:11:11.467
one is a die,
one is a deck of playing cards,

1:11:11.467 --> 1:11:13.269
and we need
one last thing.

1:11:13.269 --> 1:11:15.104
Money.

1:11:15.104 --> 1:11:18.374
- Simon, can you take out
some money?

1:11:18.374 --> 1:11:20.964
And just put it
on the table

1:11:20.964 --> 1:11:21.010
And just put it
on the table

1:11:21.010 --> 1:11:23.012
and I will come back to that
in a second.

1:11:23.012 --> 1:11:26.215
- So, Louis, please check out
this blindfold.

1:11:26.215 --> 1:11:28.351
Have a look if there is
anything hidden.

1:11:28.351 --> 1:11:29.752
So you can't see anything
through it?

1:11:29.752 --> 1:11:30.753
- I can't, no.

1:11:30.753 --> 1:11:31.854
- Thank you
very much.

1:11:31.854 --> 1:11:32.855
- Thank you.

1:11:32.855 --> 1:11:33.856
- Can I look at
something?

1:11:36.392 --> 1:11:39.128
- Yes.

1:11:39.128 --> 1:11:41.297
I'm here for you, Howie.
- Okay.

1:11:41.297 --> 1:11:44.634
- And we'll do
a little game with you.

1:11:44.634 --> 1:11:46.135
Just take the die
for a second

1:11:46.135 --> 1:11:47.570
and roll the die
on the table.

1:11:47.570 --> 1:11:50.206
Oh, number six.
You're lucky.

1:11:50.206 --> 1:11:50.964
You will do it
one last time,

1:11:50.964 --> 1:11:51.607
You will do it
one last time,

1:11:51.607 --> 1:11:53.476
but this time
you will cover it

1:11:53.476 --> 1:11:56.245
so no one can see
what number is on top.

1:11:56.245 --> 1:12:00.283
Go for it.

1:12:00.283 --> 1:12:01.317
- I was testing it.

1:12:01.317 --> 1:12:02.418
- You're happy?

1:12:02.418 --> 1:12:03.886
- I'm thrilled.

1:12:03.886 --> 1:12:04.887
- Thrilled.

1:12:04.887 --> 1:12:06.455
I will turn around.
- Okay.

1:12:06.455 --> 1:12:07.757
- You will have
a look.

1:12:07.757 --> 1:12:09.292
- Okay.

1:12:09.292 --> 1:12:10.726
Okay.

1:12:10.726 --> 1:12:12.128
- You did?
- I did.

1:12:12.128 --> 1:12:15.932
- Reach out your right arm
like this, to the side.

1:12:19.435 --> 1:12:20.503
- Howie.

1:12:20.503 --> 1:12:20.964
- Yes.

1:12:20.964 --> 1:12:21.838
- Yes.

1:12:21.838 --> 1:12:25.641
- I don't think you rolled
a very high number.

1:12:25.641 --> 1:12:29.846
It was not a four,
not a five, not a six.

1:12:29.846 --> 1:12:32.081
I'm pretty sure, Howie,
you rolled

1:12:32.081 --> 1:12:33.850
the one.

1:12:33.850 --> 1:12:36.886
- Can we have
a look?

1:12:36.886 --> 1:12:38.621
Yes.
- It scared me.

1:12:38.621 --> 1:12:41.057
- Number one on top.

1:12:44.360 --> 1:12:46.062
- That's impossible.

1:12:46.062 --> 1:12:49.198
- Okay,
one out of six.

1:12:49.198 --> 1:12:50.964
Let's make it a little bit
more complex.

1:12:50.964 --> 1:12:51.100
Let's make it a little bit
more complex.

1:12:51.100 --> 1:12:53.169
Let's take the playing cards
and, Mel B, shuffle them.

1:12:53.169 --> 1:12:56.005
Mix them up.

1:12:56.005 --> 1:12:58.241
Spread out the cards,
make a nice fan.

1:12:58.241 --> 1:13:00.643
And, Louis, you select
one card just for you.

1:13:00.643 --> 1:13:02.678
Keep it a secret.

1:13:02.678 --> 1:13:04.380
Whatever card
you like,

1:13:04.380 --> 1:13:08.484
and place it facedown
on my palm.

1:13:08.484 --> 1:13:11.888
Yes.

1:13:14.223 --> 1:13:17.260
- Louis, you chose
the five of hearts.

1:13:19.028 --> 1:13:20.129
- Yeah.

1:13:20.129 --> 1:13:20.964
- My God!
- Yes, it is...

1:13:20.964 --> 1:13:21.530
- My God!
- Yes, it is...

1:13:21.530 --> 1:13:22.999
- Oh!
- the five of hearts.

1:13:22.999 --> 1:13:25.067
- Oh, my God!

1:13:25.067 --> 1:13:26.335
- How do they
do that?

1:13:26.335 --> 1:13:27.336
- Wow!
- Wow.

1:13:27.336 --> 1:13:30.940
- Oh, my God,
that's so weird.

1:13:30.940 --> 1:13:33.342
- Okay,
one out of six,

1:13:33.342 --> 1:13:35.444
1 out of 52.

1:13:35.444 --> 1:13:36.879
Let's make it
impossible.

1:13:36.879 --> 1:13:38.915
Let's make it
one in a million.

1:13:38.915 --> 1:13:40.016
That's your money
on the table, right?

1:13:40.016 --> 1:13:41.217
- Yeah.

1:13:41.217 --> 1:13:42.618
- Nothing is set up tonight,
that's correct?

1:13:42.618 --> 1:13:43.886
- Correct.
- And I don't want to

1:13:43.886 --> 1:13:46.756
touch your money at all,
but Heidi, you can.

1:13:46.756 --> 1:13:48.357
Just select
one bill

1:13:48.357 --> 1:13:50.964
and place it
on my hand.

1:13:50.964 --> 1:13:53.296
and place it
on my hand.

1:13:53.296 --> 1:13:55.197
We will do
the impossible.

1:13:55.197 --> 1:13:57.900
You all know there's
a serial number on every bill.

1:13:57.900 --> 1:13:59.869
To know
this exact number,

1:13:59.869 --> 1:14:02.738
it's more impossible than
to win a million in Vegas.

1:14:02.738 --> 1:14:05.308
But that is what
I want to know.

1:14:05.308 --> 1:14:06.809
Amélie,
go for it.

1:14:06.809 --> 1:14:08.945
- Okay.

1:14:08.945 --> 1:14:12.415
You like to
challenge me tonight.

1:14:12.415 --> 1:14:15.217
So--but I'll
try it.

1:14:15.217 --> 1:14:17.920
You watch very closely.
The first number is an eight.

1:14:17.920 --> 1:14:19.722
Yes?

1:14:19.722 --> 1:14:20.964
Yes?
- Yes.

1:14:20.964 --> 1:14:21.257
Yes?
- Yes.

1:14:21.257 --> 1:14:22.825
- Holy cow.

1:14:22.825 --> 1:14:23.926
- How are they
doing this?

1:14:23.926 --> 1:14:25.594
- Then there is
a nine.

1:14:25.594 --> 1:14:26.896
- Yes.
- Yes.

1:14:26.896 --> 1:14:28.297
- A seven.

1:14:28.297 --> 1:14:29.799
- Yes.
- And a five.

1:14:31.400 --> 1:14:34.670
- I can't believe
how she can do this.

1:14:34.670 --> 1:14:36.205
- There is a three.

1:14:36.205 --> 1:14:39.241
I sense a two.

1:14:41.177 --> 1:14:42.745
No wait,
there is a three.

1:14:42.745 --> 1:14:44.413
- Yep.
- Yes.

1:14:44.413 --> 1:14:45.948
- No, she's not from
this planet.

1:14:45.948 --> 1:14:50.653
- The next number
must be an eight.

1:14:50.653 --> 1:14:50.964
That's a four.

1:14:50.964 --> 1:14:53.289
That's a four.

1:14:53.289 --> 1:14:56.659
And there is
a letter,

1:14:56.659 --> 1:14:59.061
and it must be
an "A."

1:14:59.061 --> 1:15:00.663
- Wow!
- Is that correct?

1:15:03.632 --> 1:15:04.967
- That's correct.

1:15:08.904 --> 1:15:10.306
- Wow.

1:15:10.306 --> 1:15:11.640
Kinda spooky.

1:15:11.640 --> 1:15:13.209
- Let's go to Vegas.

1:15:13.209 --> 1:15:14.944
Thank you, Simon.

1:15:16.545 --> 1:15:18.147
- That is terrifying.

1:15:18.147 --> 1:15:20.616
- I think you guys are
absolutely incredible,

1:15:20.616 --> 1:15:20.964
but I also love the whole entire
experience of it all.

1:15:20.964 --> 1:15:24.053
but I also love the whole entire
experience of it all.

1:15:24.053 --> 1:15:25.187
It's very mysterious.

1:15:25.187 --> 1:15:26.255
Fantastic.
- Thank you very much.

1:15:26.255 --> 1:15:27.823
- Thank you so much.
- Louis.

1:15:27.823 --> 1:15:30.393
- It genuinely is hard
to even react to that

1:15:30.393 --> 1:15:32.128
because it's
mind-blowing.

1:15:32.128 --> 1:15:33.162
I am buzzing.

1:15:33.162 --> 1:15:34.296
- Thank you
very much.

1:15:34.296 --> 1:15:35.698
- Thank you
very much.

1:15:35.698 --> 1:15:38.100
- Well, first of all,
thank you, Simon.

1:15:38.100 --> 1:15:39.468
I'll keep that.

1:15:42.071 --> 1:15:44.173
What you do
you can't really explain.

1:15:44.173 --> 1:15:45.941
I think you just have to see it
to believe it.

1:15:45.941 --> 1:15:47.209
Brilliant, guys.

1:15:47.209 --> 1:15:48.444
- Thank you so much.
- Absolutely brilliant.

1:15:48.444 --> 1:15:49.545
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Mel B.

1:15:49.545 --> 1:15:50.946
- Honest to God,

1:15:50.946 --> 1:15:50.964
I've never seen anything
like it in my life.

1:15:50.964 --> 1:15:52.948
I've never seen anything
like it in my life.

1:15:52.948 --> 1:15:55.217
You definitely stepped it up
this time round.

1:15:55.217 --> 1:15:56.452
Incredible.

1:15:56.452 --> 1:15:57.787
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you very much.

1:15:57.787 --> 1:16:00.089
- You are the most amazing thing
that I have ever seen

1:16:00.089 --> 1:16:01.557
in the history
of this show.

1:16:01.557 --> 1:16:02.958
I'm 60 years old.

1:16:02.958 --> 1:16:04.860
I've never been involved
in anything so weird,

1:16:04.860 --> 1:16:07.229
so scary, so wonderful.
Thank you so much.

1:16:07.229 --> 1:16:08.364
- Thank you
so much.

1:16:08.364 --> 1:16:09.732
- Thank you
very much.

1:16:15.538 --> 1:16:17.273
- They could win.

1:16:17.273 --> 1:16:19.275
- Out of 19,
we gotta get 6.

1:16:19.275 --> 1:16:20.964
You think we have
a tough decision tonight?

1:16:20.964 --> 1:16:21.043
You think we have
a tough decision tonight?

1:16:21.043 --> 1:16:22.111
- Yes, I do.
- I do.

1:16:22.111 --> 1:16:23.279
- There's been
a lot of great acts.

1:16:23.279 --> 1:16:24.914
- Trying to make
a decision...

1:16:24.914 --> 1:16:26.282
- Here we go.
- in the same night,

1:16:26.282 --> 1:16:27.616
it's impossible.

1:16:27.616 --> 1:16:29.185
- So can you see
into the future?

1:16:29.185 --> 1:16:30.719
Are you gonna be
one of the seven?

1:16:30.719 --> 1:16:33.823
- We have an idea,
but we'll see if we're right.

1:16:33.823 --> 1:16:34.924
- Oh, okay.

1:16:34.924 --> 1:16:37.326
- This is so freaky
and so scary.

1:16:37.326 --> 1:16:40.062
I just feel bad that millions of
people are watching this at home

1:16:40.062 --> 1:16:42.164
and aren't here with us
to experience this.

1:16:48.370 --> 1:16:49.538
- Welcome back to

1:16:49.538 --> 1:16:50.840
"America's Got Talent"
Judge Cuts.

1:16:50.840 --> 1:16:51.974
The performances are over,

1:16:51.974 --> 1:16:53.109
the audience is gone,

1:16:53.109 --> 1:16:55.444
and the judges have
begun deliberating.

1:16:55.444 --> 1:16:58.013
- Looking at it now,
it's pretty intense.

1:16:58.013 --> 1:16:59.748
My face was on one of these
once, hey, Simon?

1:16:59.748 --> 1:17:00.950
- Exactly.

1:17:00.950 --> 1:17:02.585
- She's
the Golden Buzzer.

1:17:02.585 --> 1:17:03.586
- Thank you.

1:17:03.586 --> 1:17:04.753
- We now have to put...
- Six.

1:17:04.753 --> 1:17:07.022
- six more through.

1:17:07.022 --> 1:17:09.558
- This journey cannot end
for us tonight.

1:17:09.558 --> 1:17:11.160
We've come
too far

1:17:11.160 --> 1:17:12.394
and we fought
too hard.

1:17:12.394 --> 1:17:13.762
- He didn't
step it up.

1:17:13.762 --> 1:17:15.865
And he was great
in the first audition.

1:17:15.865 --> 1:17:16.001
- There's a few people that
didn't step it up.

1:17:16.001 --> 1:17:17.500
- There's a few people that
didn't step it up.

1:17:17.500 --> 1:17:20.669
- Anybody can be out
or in.

1:17:20.669 --> 1:17:23.038
It's like really a lot of
question marks right now.

1:17:24.607 --> 1:17:25.975
- If I was
watching the show,

1:17:25.975 --> 1:17:29.111
these are the two people
I would be talking about.

1:17:29.111 --> 1:17:30.279
- You'd remember them,
they'd stand out.

1:17:30.279 --> 1:17:31.380
- I'd be talking
about them.

1:17:31.380 --> 1:17:32.481
- Yeah, you'd be
talking about them,

1:17:32.481 --> 1:17:34.583
why are they still in
the competition?

1:17:34.583 --> 1:17:36.819
- What you try to do every day,
you know,

1:17:36.819 --> 1:17:38.154
is make your parents
proud of you,

1:17:38.154 --> 1:17:41.023
so this is like
the biggest night of my life.

1:17:41.023 --> 1:17:44.593
- I'm not happy,
but we've made a decision.

1:17:44.593 --> 1:17:45.694
- We did.

1:17:45.694 --> 1:17:46.001
- Thank you,
Louis.

1:17:46.001 --> 1:17:47.363
- Thank you,
Louis.

1:17:47.363 --> 1:17:48.664
- Thanks.
- Did you enjoy it?

1:17:48.664 --> 1:17:49.665
- I did.
I really enjoyed it.

1:17:49.665 --> 1:17:50.666
I had a great time.

1:17:50.666 --> 1:17:51.867
It's interesting,

1:17:51.867 --> 1:17:53.035
because obviously,
I've been an auditionee,

1:17:53.035 --> 1:17:54.537
but never a judge,
of course.

1:17:54.537 --> 1:17:56.438
And actually,
to make that final decision

1:17:56.438 --> 1:17:59.542
on people's careers, lives,
is a--is a big deal.

1:18:11.387 --> 1:18:12.454
- Been a long day,
right?

1:18:12.454 --> 1:18:13.455
- Yeah.

1:18:13.455 --> 1:18:14.990
- You understand that

1:18:14.990 --> 1:18:16.001
part of doing
a competition like this

1:18:16.001 --> 1:18:17.159
part of doing
a competition like this

1:18:17.159 --> 1:18:18.661
is that you have to compete
with others,

1:18:18.661 --> 1:18:22.965
and unfortunately, we do have to
lose people along the way.

1:18:22.965 --> 1:18:24.900
I'm sorry to say
to all three of you,

1:18:24.900 --> 1:18:26.535
you haven't made it through
to the live shows.

1:18:28.837 --> 1:18:31.140
But keep doing what you're
doing, all three of you.

1:18:31.140 --> 1:18:32.274
- Okay.

1:18:32.274 --> 1:18:35.711

- We are,
we're so proud of you.

1:18:41.850 --> 1:18:42.985
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

1:18:42.985 --> 1:18:44.353
- Okay, you got
a big heart, honey.

1:18:44.353 --> 1:18:46.001
We've always
known that.

1:18:46.001 --> 1:18:46.722
We've always
known that.

1:18:52.328 --> 1:18:55.030
- We kind of butted heads
on the panel,

1:18:55.030 --> 1:18:56.699
because we all have
our favorites here.

1:18:56.699 --> 1:18:59.535
But we had to come to
a decision.

1:19:02.004 --> 1:19:06.308
The act moving forward
is...

1:19:08.877 --> 1:19:09.878

I like that.

1:19:29.632 --> 1:19:32.001

1:23:24.233 --> 1:23:26.268
- Oh, my gosh,
that was great.

1:23:26.268 --> 1:23:27.736
- You guys ready
for Hollywood?

1:23:29.037 --> 1:23:30.272
- ♪ The story of my life... ♪

1:23:30.272 --> 1:23:31.473
- We're celebrating.

1:23:31.473 --> 1:23:33.575
That's the end of
the Judge Cuts.

1:23:33.575 --> 1:23:35.377
And now,
who's it up to?

1:23:35.377 --> 1:23:36.578
- Now it's up to you,
America.

1:23:36.578 --> 1:23:39.214
- Even though we didn't
always agree,

1:23:39.214 --> 1:23:40.682
we all butted heads
a little bit,

1:23:40.682 --> 1:23:42.751
I think we made
the right decisions.

1:23:42.751 --> 1:23:44.419
- And now,
on to the live shows.

1:23:44.419 --> 1:23:45.454
Take care, everyone.

1:23:45.454 --> 1:23:46.001
- ♪ The story of my life ♪

1:23:46.001 --> 1:23:48.056
- ♪ The story of my life ♪

1:23:53.929 --> 1:23:56.064
- Okay, good to go.
Remember the sign, guys.

1:24:10.579 --> 1:24:12.848
- Are you ready,
America?

1:24:12.848 --> 1:24:15.851
Now you are
the judges.

1:24:20.255 --> 1:24:24.026
Only one act is walking out of
here with $1 million.

1:24:24.026 --> 1:24:26.194
- Now it's up to you,
America.

1:24:26.194 --> 1:24:27.963
- They just have to leave
everything out there

1:24:27.963 --> 1:24:29.831
on the stage
and bring it.

1:24:31.099 --> 1:24:33.368
- This show is about
the American dream.

1:24:33.368 --> 1:24:35.304
We're here to
find a star.
