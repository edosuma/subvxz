WEBVTT

02:08.720 --> 02:10.600
10:53 pm.

02:11.350 --> 02:14.760
Sorry for scaring you like that.
I was just heading home and uh...

02:15.060 --> 02:18.480
we met before in the can.
- Oh, you're Wyatt, right?

02:18.560 --> 02:22.640
Yeah. So, you working late or
you downloading a multitude of porn?

02:22.900 --> 02:26.400
I have to be out of here by tomorrow
so I'm just trying to finish up,

02:26.490 --> 02:29.190
what about you?
- You kidding? This is an early night.

02:29.280 --> 02:31.410
Hard to believe once upon a time...

02:31.490 --> 02:35.030
it was a measure of a man's success
on how little he worked.

02:35.830 --> 02:39.610
What's the deal? Our firm hires you
to bless our books they send you?

02:39.710 --> 02:43.040
I'm the audit manager, yeah. I handle
the same 7 or 8 clients every year.

02:43.130 --> 02:46.210
I must've done Stern
for something like four years now.

02:46.300 --> 02:50.380
Wow. So you like this work?
- I do. The order of it appeals to me...

02:50.850 --> 02:53.520
the symmetry.

02:53.600 --> 02:56.680
It's alright, I guess,
if you like workin' with numbers.

02:56.770 --> 02:58.760
Do you like being a lawyer?

02:58.850 --> 03:02.390
Yeah, it's alright, I guess,
if you like workin' with assholes.

03:03.570 --> 03:07.560
I'm probably disturbing you, so...
- Hey, no, it's alright. I'm almost done.

03:07.650 --> 03:10.320
Really.
- Oh.

03:10.410 --> 03:12.070
So...

03:14.950 --> 03:18.160
Worth and Berman, huh?
Did they headhunt you?

03:18.460 --> 03:22.160
Yeah, my senior year of college.
They subsidized my graduate degree.

03:22.250 --> 03:25.370
Ah, I see.
So you were... you were poor, right?

03:27.510 --> 03:30.760
I guess I was.
I was brought up by my mom on her own

03:30.840 --> 03:34.380
and she died when I was 19
and so it was kind of like a lifeline.

03:35.720 --> 03:38.890
Wow. Sounds like you needed it.
- I'm sure there's a lot of people

03:38.980 --> 03:41.050
that had it worse.
- Not here.

03:41.150 --> 03:44.350
Practically every suit I know
is Harvard by way of Andover.

03:44.440 --> 03:46.350
Are you?
- Oh, hell no. No, no.

03:46.440 --> 03:51.070
I'm Princeton by way of Exeter.
- But that's like the same. Oh yeah.

03:52.360 --> 03:55.070
So, Jonathan...

03:55.700 --> 03:59.230
I think I have something here
which might help you to focus.

04:00.830 --> 04:03.290
You smoke?
- Not for a long time.

04:03.380 --> 04:06.580
Good. This'll give you a real buzz,
then.

04:14.300 --> 04:17.970
I don't know...
I just sometimes feel so, uh...

04:21.850 --> 04:24.890
you know...
removed.

04:27.020 --> 04:30.140
I work for one of the biggest
accounting firms in the world

04:30.230 --> 04:32.700
and there's not so much as
a desk there to prove it.

04:32.700 --> 04:33.770
My new senior manager

04:33.860 --> 04:36.400
I haven't even met him in person yet.

04:36.490 --> 04:40.020
I try to meet people at work
but it's always the same.

04:41.580 --> 04:43.790
To the accounting
staff I'm a pain because

04:43.800 --> 04:45.910
for two weeks they
have to hold their breath.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.920
They hope I don't pick up
any of their screw-ups.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.540
To everyone else I'm just a
temporary fixture so why bother.

04:56.090 --> 04:58.710
Sometimes...

04:58.800 --> 05:02.800
I sit and I look through the glass,
and I see life...

05:05.560 --> 05:08.680
literally passing me by.
- Jonathan.

05:09.110 --> 05:10.760
Yeah?

05:11.230 --> 05:12.790
By the clock on that wall there

05:12.790 --> 05:16.270
you have been talking for
thirty-seven minutes straight.

05:26.080 --> 05:29.200
I don't remember a word I said.

05:33.250 --> 05:36.250
So, God says to Jesus...

05:39.010 --> 05:42.540
I haven't felt this good
since I saw Van Halen in '97.

05:50.650 --> 05:52.720
(music)

06:04.200 --> 06:06.280
Stand clear of the closing doors, please.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.540
(music)

06:48.870 --> 06:52.950
Is this the train to Canal Street?
- Yes, this is the right train.

07:02.510 --> 07:04.580
(music)

08:02.650 --> 08:04.720
(music)

08:39.980 --> 08:42.049
(incomprehensible)

08:47.610 --> 08:51.140
So, I guess that's it.
This is my report for Mr. Cross.

08:52.110 --> 08:55.400
Could you point me towards
Wyatt Bose's office, please?

08:55.490 --> 08:57.610
Who?
- Wyatt Bose. He's one of your...

08:57.700 --> 09:00.700
Hey, quit looking down Daphne's shirt.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.950
So, get in, get out, huh?
So where's next?

09:03.040 --> 09:06.240
Clancey Funds on Friday
and then Clute-Nichols after that.

09:06.340 --> 09:09.340
Sounds like fun.
Wait up a sec.

09:10.090 --> 09:12.920
Good to meet you, Jonathan.
- You, too.

09:13.010 --> 09:16.210
So... wait.
You have the day off tomorrow?

09:17.930 --> 09:19.590
How's your backhand?

09:22.560 --> 09:24.640
(music)

10:04.390 --> 10:07.260
I'm sorry.
- Good game.

10:07.350 --> 10:09.010
Commiserations, McQuarry.

10:09.110 --> 10:12.940
You develop a killer instinct,
you'll beat the crap out of me.

10:13.820 --> 10:15.780
You know, when these
things first came out,

10:15.780 --> 10:17.570
I think I was a frosh
at boarding school.

10:17.660 --> 10:20.440
Geez, where did you get this thing?
You steal it from Jimmy Connors?

10:20.530 --> 10:21.770
What is it? Natural gut, hm?

10:21.770 --> 10:24.070
No, it's a hybrid weave
of natural gut and Kevlar.

10:24.070 --> 10:24.690
Kevlar?

10:24.870 --> 10:27.990
Yeah, I should have 'em replaced.
They're pretty frayed.

10:32.210 --> 10:35.330
Those two girls were so pretty.

10:36.090 --> 10:39.090
You don't get much, do you?

10:41.550 --> 10:44.130
Do you mean sex?
- No, flood insurance.

10:44.220 --> 10:45.570
How many women
have you slept with?

10:46.930 --> 10:47.550
I don't know.

10:48.060 --> 10:49.700
Of course you know.
Everyone knows.

10:50.100 --> 10:53.100
Maybe four.
- Maybe four?

10:53.860 --> 10:56.560
Alright. Four.
What about you?

10:56.650 --> 11:00.190
Me? I have no idea.
- You just said everyone knows.

11:01.450 --> 11:04.950
I meant everyone like you.
C'mon, hurry up. Let's go for a drink.

11:05.790 --> 11:10.200
You can borrow something of mine.
Ah. Guten Abend, Herr Kleiner.

11:11.750 --> 11:13.330
This way, Jonathan.

11:21.590 --> 11:23.470
Like it?

11:24.550 --> 11:25.880
It's a Gerhard Richter.

11:25.880 --> 11:28.770
Actually, Kleiner, the
guy we just saw downstairs,

11:28.850 --> 11:30.970
he's a hotshot art dealer.

11:31.060 --> 11:33.930
He hooked me up with this
fantastic gallery in Munich.

11:34.020 --> 11:36.100
I'll be back in a second.

12:00.460 --> 12:03.170
Try this one.

12:04.550 --> 12:05.580
What?

12:07.260 --> 12:09.380
C'mon, Jonathan.

12:09.470 --> 12:11.550
You remind me of
this guy, Jamie Getz.

12:11.550 --> 12:13.640
I met him my freshman
year at Princeton.

12:13.730 --> 12:16.420
Oh, he was real smart.
He was witty, too,

12:16.420 --> 12:18.850
when you loosened him up.
But he had this...

12:18.940 --> 12:22.470
brown. Now you assume
that he never scaled that wall.

12:23.400 --> 12:25.520
The truth is he was
the only one that got in.

12:28.030 --> 12:31.240
What happened to him?
- Oh, he killed himself.

12:31.490 --> 12:32.520
What?

12:36.330 --> 12:37.990
You're kidding.

12:40.750 --> 12:42.790
Go get changed.
- Down here?

12:43.090 --> 12:45.880
Down there.
Second door on the right.

12:48.010 --> 12:50.080
(music)

13:04.480 --> 13:06.810
Okay, Jonathan,
so just the four, huh?

13:06.900 --> 13:09.610
Oh, come on.
Now, look...

13:10.110 --> 13:13.280
I've never been
too adventuresome.

13:13.530 --> 13:16.650
What's the lamest?
- Well, I once...

13:17.870 --> 13:19.950
No, c'mon, c'mon,
share it with the group.

13:19.950 --> 13:21.790
I once phoned one
of those sex lines.

13:21.880 --> 13:22.990
Alright, now we're talking.

13:22.990 --> 13:25.130
I talked to girl named
Star for like half an hour.

13:25.210 --> 13:30.370
I ended up explaining a Section 179
deduction on the new Escalade.

13:31.640 --> 13:33.870
You paid to give tax
advice on a sex line?

13:33.880 --> 13:35.380
That's about the size of it.

13:36.890 --> 13:40.420
Oh, thank you for sharing, Jonathan.
That is pretty lame.

13:41.980 --> 13:43.600
Oh, hello.

13:48.110 --> 13:51.610
Do you... is she looking at me?
- Yeah, she's looking at you.

13:51.700 --> 13:54.900
No, she's not. C'mon.
- Maybe it's the suit?

13:56.660 --> 13:59.860
Listen, you don't think
women have the same urges?

13:59.950 --> 14:03.490
Successful women working their
asses off to stay that way?

14:03.580 --> 14:04.660
And?

14:04.750 --> 14:08.830
Well, let's just say there's a way
that it can be taken care of.

14:10.170 --> 14:12.250
You make it sound
like a mob hit.

14:29.480 --> 14:32.270
Had a good time tonight?
- I had a great time tonight.

14:32.360 --> 14:36.440
I did. I had a great time.
- Whoa. I wasn't sure at one point.

14:36.530 --> 14:38.820
No, I'm shy. But...

14:38.910 --> 14:42.080
Thank you. And thanks for the tennis
and for takin' me out.

14:42.160 --> 14:46.240
It's okay. Tennis anytime.
Particularly if you play that badly.

14:46.880 --> 14:49.410
At the corner, please.
The Waldorf Astoria.

14:49.840 --> 14:52.120
I gotta go meet somebody.

14:52.210 --> 14:55.330
Take care. Have a nice night.
- I'll call you tomorrow.

14:59.890 --> 15:01.960
(music)

15:11.320 --> 15:14.070
Any problems,
you're gonna want to see Julie Levinson.

15:14.150 --> 15:16.230
She's our Assistant Controller.

15:17.070 --> 15:20.490
But, like I said,
I don't anticipate any problems.

15:21.200 --> 15:24.450
Never had any before.
- Okay. Thanks.

15:34.340 --> 15:37.710
It's really nice out here.
I usually just brown bag it.

15:37.800 --> 15:40.860
You have to get outside. Those
fluorescent lights will kill you.

15:40.870 --> 15:41.670
I read about them.

15:44.180 --> 15:46.260
(cell phone ringing)

15:46.470 --> 15:47.510
Hello.

15:50.020 --> 15:53.140
Shit.
No, I got it here. Hold on.

15:54.900 --> 15:59.240
See if you can change it to the
6:30 out of JFK flight number four.

15:59.240 --> 15:59.940
Right. Yeah.

16:03.200 --> 16:06.570
Rutherford wants me
to join him in London ASAP.

16:06.660 --> 16:09.960
We're papering some finance with Lloyds.
I tell you about this?

16:09.960 --> 16:10.110
No.

16:10.210 --> 16:13.710
I'll be gone a couple weeks.
- Sounds sort of interesting.

16:13.790 --> 16:16.910
Gonna be as boring as sin, but...
Anyhow, I gotta get back.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.550
Ready?
- Alright.

16:24.390 --> 16:27.260
That's disgusting.
I don't want to hear that.

16:27.350 --> 16:28.810
Why?

16:28.890 --> 16:32.430
That's repulsive.
Don't ever tell anyone that. Ever.

16:32.520 --> 16:36.140
You're the kind of girl that pees
in front of men, aren't you?

16:36.230 --> 16:39.770
What goes in the Xerox Room
stays in the Xerox room.

16:39.940 --> 16:43.150
(cell phone ringing)
Jonathan McQuarry, hello.

16:43.530 --> 16:45.070
Hello?

16:54.710 --> 16:57.280
Wyatt? It's me, Jonathon.
Look, I've got your cell phone.

16:57.290 --> 16:59.420
I guess, you've got mine.
What a pain in the ass.

17:01.170 --> 17:03.170
You're probably in
the air right, so,

17:03.170 --> 17:05.170
if you get this,
give me a call on your phone.

17:06.050 --> 17:08.290
I'll speak to you later.
Take care.

17:13.349 --> 17:15.760
Mr. Lewman. Hi.
- Yes, hello.

17:15.849 --> 17:19.260
Actually, Mr. Lewman, there was
something I wanted to talk to you about.

17:19.270 --> 17:19.690
Excuse me.

17:21.980 --> 17:24.390
Hello?
(woman) Are you free tonight?

17:24.490 --> 17:28.230
Look, this isn't actually...
Sorry, could you just hold on a sec?

17:28.319 --> 17:31.740
Mr. Lewman, my bedroom...
I think I have a leak.

17:32.290 --> 17:36.070
I was hoping you could take a look.
McQuarry. 631.

17:36.460 --> 17:39.990
Oh, right. McQuarry.
Yeah, I'll get to it soon as I can.

17:40.130 --> 17:42.910
Hello?
Anyone there?

17:56.180 --> 17:58.260
(cell phone ringing)

17:58.900 --> 18:01.980
Hello?
(woman) Are you free tonight?

18:02.060 --> 18:06.140
Actually, I am, but this isn't Wyatt.
- Sorry, I didn't get that.

18:07.070 --> 18:10.440
Well, I am free, but...
- Could you be at The Dylan in one hour?

18:10.530 --> 18:12.610
I guess so, but...

18:21.580 --> 18:23.660
(music)

18:44.020 --> 18:46.100
(incomprehensible)

18:55.030 --> 18:57.110
(music)

19:09.510 --> 19:12.380
Are you waiting for me?
- Yes, I think so.

19:12.470 --> 19:15.470
Would you like a drink or something?
- No, thanks.

19:15.550 --> 19:19.090
I've got a conference call
with Tokyo early in the morning.

19:20.100 --> 19:22.220
Shall we go?
- Yes.

19:25.560 --> 19:27.640
(music)

19:35.660 --> 19:38.860
Have you been in this hotel before?
- No.

19:47.080 --> 19:51.080
Look, the person who you thought
you were talking to isn't me.

19:52.010 --> 19:55.500
You're not who I spoke to on the phone?
- No, no... Yes, yes, I am.

19:57.090 --> 20:00.090
But...
- What's wrong?

20:00.220 --> 20:03.760
Are you not attracted to me?
- Oh, you're beautiful.

20:05.230 --> 20:08.680
It's just you called me
and I came here but I don't...

20:08.770 --> 20:11.970
You don't?
- I'm not too sure what's going on.

20:12.730 --> 20:14.810
You're not too sure
what's going on?

20:23.910 --> 20:26.200
Sit down. Sit down.

20:36.170 --> 20:38.250
(music)

21:35.860 --> 21:37.930
(cell phone ringing)

21:38.780 --> 21:41.020
Hello.
- Hey, you're up early.

21:41.110 --> 21:44.650
Hey! How's London?
- Rainy. So you got mine, I got yours.

21:44.910 --> 21:47.860
Yeah, I must've grabbed it at lunch
before you left.

21:47.950 --> 21:51.050
No big deal. I already had
my work calls forwarded here.

21:51.050 --> 21:51.650
Oh, alright.

21:51.750 --> 21:54.870
So, did I get any calls?
- Yes, you did.

21:55.380 --> 21:57.750
And?
- Well...

21:58.460 --> 22:01.630
What the hell was that?
- I knew it. You met up with someone.

22:01.710 --> 22:05.380
I thought you would call me back.
- Oh, spare me. I woulda done the same.

22:05.470 --> 22:08.920
So how was it?
- It was really amazing, actually. She...

22:09.010 --> 22:11.860
Shit. I'll call you later.
They want me in a meeting.

22:11.860 --> 22:13.310
I want to hear all about
it though, alright?

22:13.640 --> 22:16.850
Alright.
- Hey as far as my phone, feel free to use it.

22:17.440 --> 22:19.430
Okay. Thanks.

22:22.530 --> 22:24.600
(music)

22:37.040 --> 22:38.580
(woman)
Yes?

22:39.250 --> 22:40.740
Hello. Uh...

22:41.880 --> 22:43.950
Yes?
- Are you free tonight?

22:46.300 --> 22:49.300
(woman) Where?
- Where, right.

22:50.430 --> 22:53.430
The Dylan Hotel.
- Perhaps The Park Avenue.

22:53.510 --> 22:55.590
In the bar, half past eleven.

23:06.650 --> 23:08.730
(music)

23:18.620 --> 23:20.660
(incomprehensible)

23:20.750 --> 23:24.160
If you are who you don't seem to be,
you're late.

23:24.500 --> 23:27.210
Excuse me?
- Are you?

23:29.340 --> 23:32.460
Late, or who I'm not supposed to be?

23:33.090 --> 23:34.340
Either.

23:36.970 --> 23:40.390
Yes, I am late,
and I am who I don't seem to be.

23:40.940 --> 23:42.260
Alright, then.

23:46.320 --> 23:49.770
Could you put this on the room, please?
- Yes, ma'am.

23:49.860 --> 23:52.570
I don't have a room.

23:54.160 --> 23:57.280
You're rather new to this,
aren't you?

23:58.120 --> 24:00.990
The initiator is
responsible for the room.

24:00.990 --> 24:02.530
That's one of the rules.

24:02.620 --> 24:05.620
Oh. So I should...
- Precisely.

24:06.040 --> 24:07.790
Oh. Excuse me.

24:11.840 --> 24:15.340
Frankly, I'm surprised whoever
sponsored you didn't explain more.

24:15.430 --> 24:18.960
Downstairs, you talked about a rule.
Are there others?

24:19.260 --> 24:22.800
No rough stuff. If that's your thing,
take it elsewhere.

24:23.560 --> 24:27.430
No business talk, and no names.
- Right.

24:30.230 --> 24:32.940
How did you get into this?
- A friend of mine...

24:33.030 --> 24:36.440
He introduced you to the list
but failed to explain the basics?

24:36.530 --> 24:37.850
Well, he had to leave town.

24:37.860 --> 24:39.860
I'm doing something
wrong here, aren't I?

24:39.950 --> 24:43.370
It's not that. You just strike me
as something of a stowaway.

24:43.460 --> 24:47.200
If it wasn't for the $4,000 suit,
I'd say you didn't belong here at all.

24:47.290 --> 24:48.830
This is us.

24:51.340 --> 24:54.090
Although,
someone obviously thought you did.

24:54.170 --> 24:56.330
And I'm a sucker for bashful boys.

25:09.400 --> 25:11.470
Can I ask you something?

25:15.280 --> 25:18.810
Why do you do this?
- For the same reason that men do it.

25:20.370 --> 25:22.440
The economics of the arrangement.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.490
Intimacy without intricacy.

25:30.170 --> 25:32.240
I work past midnight almost every night.

25:33.420 --> 25:36.590
The last dinner I had that wasn't
business was about a year ago.

25:49.940 --> 25:53.470
Hey, Wyatt, it's Jonathan.
I haven't heard from you, but...

25:54.270 --> 25:57.110
I guess you must be pretty
swamped over there.

25:57.190 --> 26:00.060
Look, I just wanted
to say thank you.

26:01.910 --> 26:03.980
(music)

26:21.010 --> 26:23.080
(music)

26:49.740 --> 26:51.820
(music)

27:51.390 --> 27:53.460
(music)

29:05.080 --> 29:08.080
Wait. Wait. Before we...

29:10.130 --> 29:13.660
The thing is, I know you.
I mean, not "know you" exactly.

29:14.050 --> 29:18.340
We met before in the Times Square
subway station. It had been raining,

29:19.470 --> 29:23.010
and you asked me if the
train stops at Canal Street.

29:30.400 --> 29:31.430
No.

29:32.820 --> 29:36.570
Wait. It just feels a little strange,
that's all.

29:37.780 --> 29:40.900
Why?
Because you've seen me before?

29:41.160 --> 29:44.860
Maybe. It's just...
- C'mon, what's the problem?

29:48.080 --> 29:49.250
Okay...

29:50.750 --> 29:54.250
I guess it is a little bit
of a gear shift.

30:02.390 --> 30:04.460
Maybe some other time.

30:09.770 --> 30:12.890
Oh, no, please.
What I mean is...

30:13.480 --> 30:16.900
By any chance...
are you hungry?

30:20.410 --> 30:24.650
Mm, you have a little bit of...
of ketchup on your chin.

30:25.750 --> 30:29.830
Oh. I'm sorry. I'm a messy eater.
- No, it's okay. So am I. Here.

30:32.090 --> 30:34.160
There you go.
- Thank you.

30:35.670 --> 30:39.340
You have a little piece of...
- Oh, what, onion in my hair?

30:46.390 --> 30:49.470
So what do you do for a living?

30:50.100 --> 30:53.520
I sit behind glass
and I watch people pass like fish.

30:53.610 --> 30:56.730
You work in a bank?
- I'm sort of an accountant.

30:56.940 --> 31:00.150
I bet that's what you always
dreamed of being when you grew up.

31:00.240 --> 31:02.910
Oh, yeah, I'm livin' the dream.
Feel free to leave now.

31:05.030 --> 31:06.580
Still here.

31:07.660 --> 31:10.500
But how about you?
- No.

31:10.580 --> 31:14.000
No, no, no, I'm afraid
that we're still on you.

31:14.710 --> 31:16.670
Frank.
- Frank?

31:17.920 --> 31:20.920
You look like a Frank.

31:23.300 --> 31:26.420
By the way, my name is...
- Oh, sh.

31:26.970 --> 31:29.010
You know the rules.
No names.

31:29.100 --> 31:32.220
Yeah, but the rules seem to
specify no conversation either.

31:33.770 --> 31:39.140
Okay. How 'bout I tell you my name,
if you guess.

31:39.820 --> 31:43.230
Oh, you're in real trouble here.
You see, I am very good at this.

31:43.320 --> 31:46.860
What are you very good at?
- Problem solving. It's what I do.

31:47.160 --> 31:51.540
I'm very good at identifying hierarchical
relationships and binary posits.

31:51.870 --> 31:53.740
Is that right?
- Absolutely.

31:53.830 --> 31:56.750
And this talent can be applied
to finding anything.

31:56.830 --> 31:59.590
For example, I know that
your name begins with an S.

32:01.590 --> 32:05.120
How do you know that?
- I saw your key chain on your purse.

32:05.220 --> 32:08.750
Wow. Excellent work.
- Thank you. So, the things we know are

32:09.010 --> 32:12.510
A, your name begins with an S.
B, you have a white coat.

32:12.600 --> 32:14.140
And C...

32:15.190 --> 32:18.300
And C, you do not know
your way around the subway.

32:18.810 --> 32:20.010
That's true.

32:20.110 --> 32:24.270
Now all I do is extrapolate from
these known qualities and your name...

32:25.610 --> 32:26.640
is...

32:28.620 --> 32:29.940
Sybil.

32:31.530 --> 32:35.230
Sophie. You're definitely a Sophie.
- Wait, with an "ie" or a "y"?

32:35.330 --> 32:37.040
Either.
- Neither.

32:37.420 --> 32:40.500
How about Syd, as in Syd Charisse?
- No, she was Syd with a C.

32:40.590 --> 32:44.120
Yeah, but maybe you spell it with an S.
- I do not.

32:44.800 --> 32:48.000
Sexy Steffi was lookin' for a train...
- No.

32:48.300 --> 32:51.500
Sunbeam.
- Oh, God, do I look like a Sunbeam?

32:51.800 --> 32:53.180
Absolutely.

32:55.470 --> 32:57.020
Well, then, that's it.

32:59.560 --> 33:03.260
I told you I was good at this.
- I'm very impressed.

33:09.950 --> 33:11.280
I'm crashing.

33:13.580 --> 33:17.160
I'd really like to see you again.
Not in a hotel.

33:18.210 --> 33:21.080
Hm, well...
we'll see about that.

33:22.380 --> 33:26.120
Maybe tomorrow?
- It is tomorrow.

33:35.310 --> 33:37.380
(music)

33:53.240 --> 33:55.310
(music)

34:29.900 --> 34:31.810
(cell phone ringing)

34:31.900 --> 34:33.980
Hello?
(Wyatt) Are you free tonight?

34:34.070 --> 34:37.600
Hey, are you back?
- I wish. It's friggin' anarchy here.

34:37.739 --> 34:39.780
(knocking at the door)
Hang on. Hello?

34:39.870 --> 34:42.989
Housekeeping.
- Uh, could you come back? Thanks.

34:43.080 --> 34:44.949
Sorry.
- Where are you?

34:45.040 --> 34:47.830
I'm in the Soho Grand.
- Soho Grand, huh?

34:47.920 --> 34:50.139
Sounds like you've
been enjoying yourself.

34:50.139 --> 34:52.000
I have.
I met this girl last night,

34:52.090 --> 34:53.250
and I broke all the rules

34:53.250 --> 34:55.540
and I had an honest-to-God
conversation with her.

34:55.630 --> 34:59.170
(Wyatt) That's extremely naughty of you.
Who is she, Romeo?

34:59.510 --> 35:00.780
I have no idea, really.

35:00.780 --> 35:03.210
I don't know very much
about her yet, but...

35:03.310 --> 35:04.730
I'm gonna see her again.

35:04.730 --> 35:07.090
I don't want to
dampen your spirits...

35:07.190 --> 35:10.310
What?
- You met her through the list.

35:10.940 --> 35:13.010
She's different.
Trust me.

35:14.610 --> 35:16.930
So when are you back?
- Hard to say.

35:17.030 --> 35:20.400
It's back-to-back bullshit here.
But next week, I hope.

35:20.490 --> 35:23.910
Well, good luck.
I'll see you when you get back.

35:24.290 --> 35:25.740
(Wyatt)
You, too.

35:30.460 --> 35:32.530
(music)

35:34.090 --> 35:36.710
Hello?
(woman) Are you free tonight?

35:36.800 --> 35:38.870
I'm sorry,
you have the wrong number.

35:42.140 --> 35:44.210
(music)

35:52.610 --> 35:55.720
Hello?
("S") Hey, are you free tonight?

35:56.610 --> 36:00.690
Can you meet me in Chinatown,
on Doyer Street? Say, eight o'clock?

36:01.030 --> 36:02.060
Okay.

36:19.510 --> 36:21.580
(music)

36:32.190 --> 36:34.260
I got you a present.

36:35.980 --> 36:38.980
Thank you.
- It looks great on you.

36:44.570 --> 36:46.030
Let's go.
- Yeah.

37:01.630 --> 37:04.500
We'd like...
we'd like one of these.

37:05.550 --> 37:08.970
And... one of these...
oh, and that.

37:10.180 --> 37:11.590
Thank you.

37:14.980 --> 37:18.390
What did you order?
- I have absolutely no idea.

37:18.980 --> 37:22.980
How do you know we'll like it?
- How do you know we won't?

37:26.200 --> 37:29.200
This is so not my life.

37:29.490 --> 37:33.360
Ever since that night on the subway
I haven't stopped thinking about you.

37:33.450 --> 37:35.530
I'm not sure I believe you.

37:37.620 --> 37:42.200
I mean, you're in a sex club.
I'm not judging you. I'm in there, too.

37:42.300 --> 37:46.380
But don't say you've been
solemnly holding a torch for me for...

37:46.630 --> 37:49.880
long now, one month?
- Point taken.

37:53.180 --> 37:55.260
I got you a present.

38:03.610 --> 38:06.520
Oh, he is so cute.

38:12.280 --> 38:13.690
Thank you.

38:27.590 --> 38:29.300
Here.
- Thanks.

38:35.760 --> 38:37.420
What is that?

38:38.810 --> 38:40.350
Ginseng gum.

38:42.770 --> 38:44.350
It's terrible.

38:46.110 --> 38:49.060
I guess it does sort of
taste like hairspray.

38:49.650 --> 38:53.400
I think I got it now.
I think your name is Suki.

39:00.330 --> 39:02.400
What?
What are you thinking about?

39:07.710 --> 39:10.420
I don't want to complicate your life.
- No...

39:11.880 --> 39:14.040
I want all the
complications you've got.

39:19.640 --> 39:21.630
Maybe you should go?

39:24.480 --> 39:26.220
Maybe you should stay.

39:33.900 --> 39:35.980
(music)

40:00.510 --> 40:02.590
(music)

40:28.790 --> 40:32.160
I know we decided not to rush, but...

40:33.590 --> 40:38.580
Just for the record, I'm doing everything
I can just to apply the brakes here.

40:39.050 --> 40:40.540
Oh, me too.

40:42.850 --> 40:45.420
Our parents would be proud.

40:50.060 --> 40:51.600
But just say...

40:52.400 --> 40:53.850
Say what?

40:56.440 --> 40:58.020
If we acted...

40:58.110 --> 41:00.460
just suddenly tore
off the rest of these

41:00.460 --> 41:02.400
clothes to consummate their deep...

41:03.370 --> 41:06.650
human needs in a frenzy of...

41:06.950 --> 41:08.660
Fucking and sucking.

41:11.080 --> 41:12.660
Beautifully put.

41:17.340 --> 41:19.410
You were saying?
- Well...

41:20.170 --> 41:23.790
Who could blame these two people?
- Who could possibly judge them?

41:24.430 --> 41:26.000
Who would know?

41:33.270 --> 41:36.270
I got it.
- Where are you going?

41:39.940 --> 41:40.970
Ice.

41:42.150 --> 41:44.230
Oh, you gonna get some ice, huh?

41:44.990 --> 41:48.110
There's a machine out in the hallway.
I'll be right back.

41:48.990 --> 41:52.530
I'll get the ice.
You stay here, I'll get the ice.

41:53.160 --> 41:55.870
Jonathan. Wait.
- No, I'll go.

42:20.150 --> 42:22.220
Would you like some help?

42:23.400 --> 42:26.240
I can manage. Thank you.

42:42.500 --> 42:44.580
I can't get the card to work.

42:47.880 --> 42:48.910
Hello?

42:50.840 --> 42:51.880
Hello?

44:02.710 --> 44:04.780
(music)

44:29.900 --> 44:30.930
Hello!

44:36.240 --> 44:37.270
Hello?

44:38.700 --> 44:40.280
Sir. Sir!

44:48.500 --> 44:50.580
(speaking Chinese)

44:56.260 --> 44:58.750
Mr. McQuarry, Detective Russo.

45:01.260 --> 45:04.470
How're you doing?
- Not too good.

45:05.810 --> 45:08.930
This is Detective Burke.
I need a background check.

45:09.020 --> 45:11.590
Last name McQuarry,
first name Jonathan.

45:11.690 --> 45:14.230
And you don't know
anything about her?

45:14.320 --> 45:17.680
Where she works, where she
lives, her phone number?

45:17.690 --> 45:18.400
Like I said,

45:18.950 --> 45:22.280
all I know about her
is her first name starts with an S.

45:22.370 --> 45:24.440
Is she a prostitute?
- No.

45:26.080 --> 45:30.410
I told you, she's a friend.
- A friend you met in a sex group.

45:33.290 --> 45:38.340
Look, who else is in this sex group?
- I don't know. It's not like that.

45:38.420 --> 45:39.970
It's anonymous.

45:40.260 --> 45:42.420
You walked into the room
and saw blood?

45:42.510 --> 45:44.810
Yeah, I saw blood and
then someone hit me,

45:44.810 --> 45:46.460
and when I came to she was gone.

45:46.560 --> 45:49.720
And you didn't see who hit you?
- No, they were behind me.

45:49.810 --> 45:53.010
They must've been hiding in the bathroom.
- Well, was there anything stolen?

45:53.110 --> 45:56.640
Your wallet, or jewelry or anything?
- No, I have my wallet.

45:56.730 --> 45:59.980
Look, Detective, please,
you've got to find her.

46:00.070 --> 46:03.360
We can't do anything until I
understand what happened tonight.

46:03.450 --> 46:05.520
I told you what happened tonight.

46:11.080 --> 46:14.280
Have you ever had
experiences like this before?

46:14.380 --> 46:17.660
No. What're you talking about?
- We spoke to the desk clerk,

46:17.750 --> 46:19.830
and he only recalls
seeing you check in.

46:21.760 --> 46:23.980
And as for the blood
you say you saw,

46:23.980 --> 46:26.130
we checked the room
and found nothing.

46:26.220 --> 46:29.340
In fact, the only blood we found
is where you hit your head.

46:33.890 --> 46:36.470
Look, I know it all sounds...

46:38.070 --> 46:41.520
But I swear there's a woman
in serious trouble right now.

46:41.610 --> 46:43.690
A woman whose name
you don't know.

46:45.240 --> 46:46.270
Yes.

46:49.490 --> 46:53.490
Look, clearly, you had a tough night.
- I'm not crazy.

46:54.040 --> 46:58.670
I tell you what. Go home, and if you
remember anything, you give me a call.

47:08.510 --> 47:10.590
(music)

47:25.190 --> 47:27.270
(music)

47:46.960 --> 47:49.030
(music)

48:03.430 --> 48:05.500
(music)

48:22.280 --> 48:24.440
Hey, Wyatt, it's me, Jonathan.

48:25.660 --> 48:28.740
Look, something happened
to me last night.

48:28.830 --> 48:31.870
Could you call me back
when you get a chance?

48:31.960 --> 48:34.030
I really need to speak to you.

48:35.790 --> 48:36.350
Can I help you?

48:36.350 --> 48:39.000
I'm trying to get into contact with
one of your attorneys, Wyatt Bose.

48:39.090 --> 48:42.260
I know he's working out of
your London office right now

48:42.340 --> 48:44.320
but I wondered if I can speak
to his assistant or anyone

48:44.320 --> 48:46.260
that would know how to
get in touch with him immediately.

48:46.350 --> 48:47.800
Of course. Just a minute.

48:48.520 --> 48:50.780
Are you sure that you
have the right firm?

48:50.780 --> 48:52.890
Yes, I met him here
when I was working.

48:52.980 --> 48:56.390
Wyatt Bose, he's six-one,
he has black hair. Wait.

48:57.360 --> 49:02.430
I have his... I have his card.
You see? Look. Wyatt Bose.

49:04.070 --> 49:07.320
I can assure you there is no one
by this name working in this firm.

49:07.410 --> 49:08.940
No, but I've seen
him in these halls.

49:08.940 --> 49:11.110
For Christ's Sake we smoked
pot in the conference room.

49:11.200 --> 49:12.660
Excuse me?

49:15.120 --> 49:18.240
Wait! Hey, wait
I'm trying to get hold of Wyatt.

49:18.340 --> 49:20.870
Who?
- Wyatt Bose. I saw you talking with him.

49:20.960 --> 49:24.630
You cracked jokes with him in the lobby.
- I crack jokes with a lot of people.

49:24.720 --> 49:28.470
Are you trying to tell me you don't...
- Hey! Easy with the hands. What is this?

49:28.550 --> 49:32.970
He said he was going to London
with a Mr. Rutherford to paper a deal.

49:33.060 --> 49:37.270
Mr. McQuarry, Mr. Rutherford
is presently recovering from hip surgery.

49:37.650 --> 49:39.310
In New Jersey.

49:49.950 --> 49:53.070
Yes?
- I'm sorry. I'm looking for Wyatt.

49:54.160 --> 49:57.660
Excuse me. Wyatt?
- Yeah, Wyatt Bose. He lives here.

49:57.750 --> 50:01.280
Uh, in, in this building?
No, I'm sorry, he must be new.

50:01.540 --> 50:04.410
No, not in this building.
In this apartment.

50:04.510 --> 50:08.380
No, wait, that painting.
It's a Gerhard Richter, right?

50:08.380 --> 50:08.590
Yes.

50:08.840 --> 50:12.050
From the gallery in Munich
that Herr Kleiner handled.

50:12.140 --> 50:14.380
The art dealer downstairs.

50:14.470 --> 50:18.010
Downstairs you must mean Mr. Moretti.
But he's in the carpet business.

50:21.650 --> 50:23.720
Young man, are you alright?

50:33.410 --> 50:35.480
(music)

51:10.150 --> 51:12.230
(knocking)

51:36.220 --> 51:38.290
She's a looker.
You weren't kidding.

51:40.970 --> 51:44.090
I can see why she had
you all hot and bothered.

51:44.640 --> 51:48.230
Oh, Jesus Christ, it was you.
Where is she?

51:49.940 --> 51:50.970
God damn it, Wyatt...

51:54.070 --> 51:57.820
I need you to listen. You're starting
next week at Clute-Nichols, yes?

51:57.910 --> 51:59.240
Who are you?

51:59.330 --> 52:01.820
I'm your only shot
at seeing her alive again.

52:01.910 --> 52:05.030
I asked you a fucking question.
- Yes.

52:05.160 --> 52:07.370
Have a seat.
Sit down.

52:11.050 --> 52:12.390
Now, as standard part of their audit

52:12.390 --> 52:15.710
you've temporary access to all
accounts and wire protocols.

52:16.300 --> 52:18.870
That's what this is about?
- Jonathan.

52:18.970 --> 52:21.260
I want you to locate
some accounts for me.

52:21.270 --> 52:23.130
You're gonna move
some money around.

52:24.220 --> 52:26.350
I can't.
- What?

52:26.440 --> 52:29.410
They're client accounts.
There's safety...

52:29.420 --> 52:29.970
Listen!

52:30.400 --> 52:34.690
I never said client accounts.
I mean some sub-accounts that I know of,

52:34.780 --> 52:38.860
outside the realm of your audit.
Masked accounts. Slush funds.

52:39.070 --> 52:42.070
Typical insider stuff, you know.
twenty mil or so,

52:42.160 --> 52:44.910
skimmed into a quiet account
for a rainy day.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.460
You don't think they'll
notice when it's gone?

52:47.460 --> 52:48.250
Eventually, yes.

52:48.330 --> 52:51.530
But they won't do shit about 'em
'cause it's dirty money.

52:51.630 --> 52:54.830
I can't.
- This isn't a negotiation, Jonathan.

52:55.670 --> 52:58.790
Besides, we're friends, remember?

53:04.140 --> 53:08.930
I'm warning you. Don't try and be a hero,
'cause people are gonna get hurt.

53:09.020 --> 53:10.280
And you go to the cops,

53:10.290 --> 53:13.480
I'll make it look like you
cut her pretty little head off.

53:13.940 --> 53:18.400
Don't hurt her.
- Just do as you're instructed,

53:19.400 --> 53:23.320
and you'll have her back in no time.
- And why should I trust you?

53:25.330 --> 53:28.860
Everything you told me was a lie.
- Oh, not lies, Jonathan.

53:29.620 --> 53:33.070
That was foreplay.
And now you're fucked.

53:39.670 --> 53:41.220
I'll be watching.

53:50.480 --> 53:52.550
(music)

54:06.370 --> 54:08.440
(cell phone ringing)

54:08.830 --> 54:09.860
Hello?

54:18.420 --> 54:21.210
You have one new voice message.

54:21.590 --> 54:23.750
New message one.

54:23.840 --> 54:29.550
Are you free tonight? It's me, Tina.
I'm in town. I want to see you again.

54:29.930 --> 54:34.060
Six months is way too long.
I'm at the Rhiga, room 802.

54:34.560 --> 54:38.850
You better show. You owe me.
After all, I was your first.

54:45.150 --> 54:47.230
(music)

55:04.130 --> 55:07.580
Hello. This is the front desk.
Your guest has arrived.

55:07.680 --> 55:09.300
You can go on up.
- Thank you.

55:34.240 --> 55:38.700
Who are you? What are you doing here?
- I believe I was invited.

55:39.830 --> 55:43.120
You have the wrong room.
- You didn't leave me a message,

55:43.210 --> 55:45.280
asking if I was free tonight?

55:48.340 --> 55:50.910
I must've dialed the wrong number.

55:52.260 --> 55:55.380
Look, I meant to call someone else.
I'm sorry.

55:57.640 --> 55:59.850
I need to speak
with you about Wyatt.

56:00.940 --> 56:03.180
I just need to ask you
a few questions, okay?

56:04.230 --> 56:08.310
I'm sorry, I don't know any Wyatt.
- Bullshit. You left him a message,

56:08.400 --> 56:11.520
asking him to meet you here.
- I thought you said...

56:12.320 --> 56:14.400
Who are you? How did you...

56:15.740 --> 56:19.570
What? No!
I just need a few answers.

56:20.000 --> 56:24.370
My name is Jonathan McQuarry.
I know you have no reason to help me,

56:24.460 --> 56:27.620
or even to believe me,
but I need to know about Wyatt.

56:27.710 --> 56:29.960
I told you, I don't know any Wyatt.

56:29.970 --> 56:32.540
That's the name of
the guy you called.

56:35.550 --> 56:38.040
No, it isn't.

56:44.140 --> 56:45.550
I'm sorry.

56:50.440 --> 56:52.020
I'm really sorry.

56:59.160 --> 57:02.940
I'm really in trouble,
and this guy, he's...

57:05.830 --> 57:07.490
he's dangerous.

57:09.750 --> 57:11.750
It was in Chicago about a year ago,

57:11.760 --> 57:14.210
at a private function
sponsored by my firm.

57:16.550 --> 57:19.800
He was attending as a guest.
- A guest of who?

57:22.680 --> 57:25.040
A guy called Hollaway.
Rudolph Holloway.

57:25.040 --> 57:27.060
I think they played
tennis together.

57:28.520 --> 57:31.810
He told me he'd just moved from
San Francisco and was in-between jobs.

57:34.900 --> 57:36.610
He was extremely smart.

57:37.650 --> 57:42.360
I know it sounds silly, but he had this
way of making me feel close to him.

57:45.120 --> 57:47.200
I found myself telling him things.

57:49.790 --> 57:51.580
I told him about this.

57:53.000 --> 57:54.880
You told him about the list.

57:56.380 --> 57:57.410
Yeah.

58:00.800 --> 58:05.260
There was something about him.
Something terrifying.

58:10.140 --> 58:12.220
So why did you call him again?

58:16.400 --> 58:19.520
You know when it's so good
you'd rather die than stop?

58:21.780 --> 58:23.340
You want to kill someone.

58:23.340 --> 58:26.280
You wanna kill the person
you're doing it with.

58:37.380 --> 58:41.210
Fuck it. Y'know what?
He was a good lay.

58:46.180 --> 58:48.250
Okay, so what's his real name?

58:50.890 --> 58:53.760
Jamie.
- Jamie?

58:55.980 --> 58:58.730
That's his name.
Jamie Getz.

59:00.690 --> 59:02.240
Jamie Getz.

59:05.820 --> 59:07.900
(music)

59:53.620 --> 59:55.690
(music)

01:00:10.550 --> 01:00:13.480
NYPD Dispatch.
How may I direct your call?

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:14.630
Central Records.

01:00:18.310 --> 01:00:19.420
Central.

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:24.980
This is Detective Russo,
Precinct 22, badge number 15421.

01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:27.780
Go ahead, Detective.

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:32.990
I need all you got for a missing person.
Last name Getz... G-E-T-Z.

01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:35.820
First name Jamie.

01:00:37.870 --> 01:00:39.990
(Officer)
Not gettin' anything.

01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:45.830
Wait. Got a hit on the
San Francisco database.

01:00:45.830 --> 01:00:46.800
You near a fax?

01:00:48.050 --> 01:00:49.420
Yeah, uh...

01:00:51.050 --> 01:00:55.510
Yes, send it to 212-555-0110.

01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:58.260
Uh, Russo?
- That's right.

01:00:58.850 --> 01:01:01.090
Send you all we got.
- Thanks.

01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:06.510
You have two unheard messages.

01:01:06.610 --> 01:01:09.940
It's Petersen.
I heard you called in sick today.

01:01:10.030 --> 01:01:12.800
Just making sure you'll
wrap up Clancey tomorrow.

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:14.360
Call me if you need anything.

01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:20.030
Hi, this is Mr. Lewman, the Super.
I haven't forgotten about your pipe leak.

01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:24.490
I'll have a look at it Wednesday evening.
I assume you'll still be at work,

01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:26.820
so I'll let myself in. Thanks.

01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:29.040
End of messages.

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:32.040
(phone ringing)

01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:36.500
Hello?

01:01:38.430 --> 01:01:39.460
Hello?

01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:43.640
(Wyatt) I'm just making sure you can
start Clute-Nichols on Wednesday.

01:01:43.730 --> 01:01:47.090
I want her back.
- Two more days, and she's all yours.

01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:49.260
No, not two days,
I want her back now.

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:53.430
What?
- Yeah, 'cause I know all about you.

01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:56.850
I know who you are,
Jamie Getz.

01:01:57.950 --> 01:02:00.990
I know all about
your best friend Rudolph Holloway,

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:02.390
and where you come from

01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:05.290
and your days as a two-bit
hustler in San Francisco

01:02:05.370 --> 01:02:08.820
and three years at Avenal
for insurance fraud, arson.

01:02:11.170 --> 01:02:12.330
How did you uh...

01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:14.630
Doesn't matter.
What matters is what I know.

01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:19.170
Now I want her back,
unharmed...

01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:23.680
or else I tell your pathetic story
to the cops. Do you understand?

01:02:24.810 --> 01:02:26.850
Well-played, Jonathan.

01:02:34.690 --> 01:02:36.770
(music)

01:02:57.880 --> 01:02:59.960
(music)

01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:20.110
Mr. McQuarry, you have a phone call
from a Detective Russo. Line four.

01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:27.360
The body came in a little while ago.
She was found in a taxi.

01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:29.590
The driver was in a coffee shop,

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:31.900
came back and there she
was in the back seat.

01:03:32.830 --> 01:03:36.780
And she fits the description you gave us
of that missing woman of yours.

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:42.090
And what's her name?
- Simone Wilkenson.

01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:46.340
Let's go this way.

01:03:53.270 --> 01:03:55.340
You want to step in,
Mr. McQuarry, please?

01:04:04.410 --> 01:04:05.440
Okay.

01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:20.790
Is this the woman you were with
the other night, Mr. McQuarry?

01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:29.680
Mr. McQuarry?
- Yeah.

01:04:30.890 --> 01:04:33.180
Have you seen this woman before?

01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:36.510
No, I've never seen her before.

01:04:38.690 --> 01:04:41.890
Who is she?
- She's a Wall Street analyst.

01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:47.440
And... and what happened to her?
- She was strangled with something.

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:50.650
Coulda been wire, even a string.

01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:55.030
Lab reports show traces of Kevlar
in the wound.

01:04:55.330 --> 01:04:58.370
It's natural gut and Kevlar.
- Kevlar?

01:04:59.330 --> 01:05:02.750
Kevlar?
- That should narrow it down for us.

01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:08.420
You want to tell me anything else?

01:05:10.590 --> 01:05:11.630
No.

01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:18.220
(music)

01:05:47.590 --> 01:05:49.660
(music)

01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:27.660
(music)

01:06:40.270 --> 01:06:43.430
Morning, Einstein.
Ready for your big day?

01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:47.300
You know fuckin' shit.

01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:51.270
You think because you know
my name you know me.

01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:54.940
You have no idea
what I'm capable of.

01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:59.990
Yes, I do. You murdered Simone,
and you constantly try to set me up.

01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:04.910
Not if you behave.
But if you screw with me today

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:09.450
what I did to her is kindness compared to
what I'll do to your little girlfriend.

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:14.160
Why, you won't even recognize her
when I'm through.

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:16.860
But her fate's in your hands.

01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:20.340
If you don't go through
with it, I'll kill her.

01:07:21.350 --> 01:07:24.430
Yeah.
But if I do, you'll kill me.

01:07:25.390 --> 01:07:27.220
Yeah.
It's a bit tricky.

01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:29.560
But what do you care?

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:32.650
You were dead long before I
met you, you just didn't know.

01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:37.890
You got no killer instinct,
Jonathan.

01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:41.860
I'll give the instructions
to you later.

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:46.200
You've got until 6 p.m.
to execute them,

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:47.360
or I execute her.

01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:56.250
Now, remember, be nice to
everybody on your first day at work.

01:07:57.420 --> 01:08:00.210
First impressions are everything,
don't you agree?

01:08:13.110 --> 01:08:15.180
(music)

01:08:25.370 --> 01:08:28.370
Mr. McQuarry. Follow me, please.
- Hello.

01:08:30.370 --> 01:08:33.490
(controller)
All of our C7 logs are on the system.

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:39.580
(incomprehensible)

01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:47.290
(music)

01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:25.460
I just saw this in my in-box.
It's for you.

01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:28.500
I guess it came in a little
while ago by messenger.

01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:31.470
Thank you.

01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:41.390
(Wyatt) Pay attention, Jonathan.
This is what you're gonna do.

01:09:41.479 --> 01:09:45.020
Look for a group of sub-accounts
in the Liebling-Holloway Trust.

01:09:45.109 --> 01:09:47.979
These are masked accounts.
48 separate line items

01:09:48.069 --> 01:09:51.189
with IBAN numbers ending with 6700.

01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:53.819
You bundle these phantom accounts

01:09:53.910 --> 01:09:57.830
and set up a standard wire transfer
to the Banco Nationale, Madrid.

01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:00.750
An account's already been
set up in your name.

01:10:04.210 --> 01:10:06.180
Clute-Nichols is
very particular about

01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:08.340
who accesses their
private holding accounts.

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:10.820
But you have a
level four clearance,

01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:12.960
and that's why you're
my friend, remember?

01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:21.510
At exactly 5 o'clock, you're gonna log in
and begin a global fund exchange.

01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:25.900
Once you're inside, you're gonna
access the Liebling-Holloway Trust

01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:28.060
through Rudolph Holloway's
private account.

01:10:29.150 --> 01:10:32.490
You'll only have 40 minutes
to locate the private trust accounts

01:10:32.570 --> 01:10:35.990
and manually consolidate all balances
into a single fund wire.

01:10:36.910 --> 01:10:40.490
Once you're done, you'll encode
this fund wire for an end-of-day transfer

01:10:40.580 --> 01:10:42.660
to the Clute-Nichols office in Hong Kong.

01:10:48.010 --> 01:10:50.410
The Asian market
opens 15 hours ahead of us.

01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:54.010
Thus, this transfer will be catalogued
as Friday's business

01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:58.220
and won't flag on the Clute transfer log
until end of business Monday.

01:10:58.310 --> 01:11:00.550
That's four days after
we're done, Jonathan.

01:11:02.350 --> 01:11:05.560
That's plenty of time for me
to fill out a withdrawal slip in Spain.

01:11:12.030 --> 01:11:13.490
Hello, sir.

01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:19.150
(music)

01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:28.590
Hey, Russo. Simone Wilkenson spent
the night at the Dylan two weeks ago.

01:11:29.130 --> 01:11:32.660
The guy you like, McQuarry,
paid for the mini-bar in the room.

01:11:33.050 --> 01:11:35.120
Let's go pick him up.

01:11:37.970 --> 01:11:40.050
(music)

01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:12.950
(music)

01:12:33.940 --> 01:12:36.180
It's not coming out
of our pockets, is it?

01:12:37.530 --> 01:12:38.610
What?

01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:41.820
That delivery. You didn't bill it to us.
- No, of course not.

01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:45.820
Good.
You guys charge enough as it is.

01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:53.870
Is everything okay?
- Okay?

01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:58.500
With the audit.
- Yeah, yeah. It's fine.

01:12:59.590 --> 01:13:02.050
I... it seems to be going very well.

01:13:08.770 --> 01:13:09.800
Good.

01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:32.240
It's not exactly a spectator sport.

01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:40.330
Yeah, well,
I was gonna order in dinner anyway.

01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:44.290
You want something?
- No, I'm fine, thank you.

01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:19.530
(music)

01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:40.550
(cell phone ringing)

01:14:54.370 --> 01:14:56.450
(music)

01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:02.530
Taxi!

01:15:11.390 --> 01:15:13.460
(music)

01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:34.940
(music)

01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:48.870
Come on.

01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:25.570
(scream)

01:16:54.650 --> 01:16:56.730
(incomprehensible)

01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:33.930
(music)

01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:02.960
(music)

01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:24.690
What happened?
- Probably a gas leak.

01:18:25.870 --> 01:18:29.650
Which apartment?
- 631. Jonathan McQuarry.

01:18:31.870 --> 01:18:34.990
Is there a body?
- Coroner's already taken it away.

01:18:50.470 --> 01:18:52.550
(music)

01:18:57.690 --> 01:19:00.860
(pilot) We should be arriving
in Madrid by 6 a.m.

01:19:03.490 --> 01:19:06.060
Excuse me, are you finished with that?

01:19:06.990 --> 01:19:09.320
Please, go ahead.
- Thanks.

01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:14.950
You on business?
- Yes, I am.

01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:18.080
What do you do?
- I'm an accountant.

01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:20.620
Do you like it?
- I love it.

01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:23.750
Numbers know how to behave, right?
- Sure.

01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:27.330
Order and symmetry.
What else could a man need?

01:19:27.930 --> 01:19:29.970
Jim Winter.
Deutsche Bank.

01:19:30.050 --> 01:19:32.690
Jonathan McQuarry, Worth and Berman.
Nice to meet you.

01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:33.170
Likewise.

01:19:42.650 --> 01:19:44.730
(music)

01:20:23.150 --> 01:20:24.690
What do you think?

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:34.200
You certainly look the part, Wyatt.

01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:35.070
Whoa, Wyatt?

01:20:35.490 --> 01:20:38.610
Who's Wyatt? My name is...
- Hey. Don't.

01:20:39.370 --> 01:20:41.450
Yeah, the rules.
No names, huh?

01:20:42.330 --> 01:20:45.040
That's a nice suit.
- When did you get in?

01:20:45.130 --> 01:20:47.200
Couple of days ago.
- Two days, huh?

01:20:48.460 --> 01:20:52.460
Been enjoying Madrid?
- Been jet-lagged.

01:20:53.180 --> 01:20:55.460
We need champagne.
You want to order some?

01:20:55.460 --> 01:20:56.630
No, I'm fine with this.

01:20:56.720 --> 01:21:00.260
Then give me a beer.
Holy shit, look at this.

01:21:01.310 --> 01:21:05.440
Wow. I spoke to Mr. Ruiz
at Banco Nacional de San Sebastian.

01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:08.140
He's ready for us whenever we want.

01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:10.140
You're about to be a
millionairess, baby.

01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:13.020
How about that?
Little ol' you, huh?

01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:16.050
From the corner of the
street and here you are,

01:21:16.060 --> 01:21:17.400
to the biggest double suite.

01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:21.690
Who's always looking out for you?

01:21:22.710 --> 01:21:26.370
Oh, yeah. Suits and ties,
I told you, they're the big game.

01:21:28.170 --> 01:21:32.000
Hey. I'm paying you a million bucks
for services rendered.

01:21:32.130 --> 01:21:36.590
What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Nothing. Christ, I'm jet-lagged.

01:21:37.510 --> 01:21:38.750
I do so hate to be crass,

01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:41.090
but you don't have "No,
thank you" rights here.

01:21:41.770 --> 01:21:43.840
You don't have
to tell me that twice.

01:21:47.230 --> 01:21:50.560
So, how did it go?
Everything okay?

01:21:51.070 --> 01:21:53.560
Perfect.
You did a great job on him.

01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:57.940
Yeah, that poor bastard
was practically in love with you.

01:22:01.660 --> 01:22:04.610
He said that?
- He didn't need to say it.

01:22:08.460 --> 01:22:11.620
So, he just transferred the money,
no questions?

01:22:11.710 --> 01:22:13.230
Sure, he had questions.

01:22:13.230 --> 01:22:16.210
He said he would only
do it if you were safe.

01:22:18.220 --> 01:22:19.800
What about him?

01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:25.050
Is he safe?
- Well, he had a little accident.

01:22:37.900 --> 01:22:39.980
What?
- The old routine.

01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:56.040
You killed him?
- It was an accident.

01:22:56.130 --> 01:22:58.090
You fucking killed him?

01:23:00.430 --> 01:23:02.580
You fucking piece of shit.

01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:05.130
You fucking lousy... lousy...

01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:10.510
He knew my name.
Jesus Christ, why do you care?

01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:13.500
How long do you think he
would've waited for you to show

01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:14.470
before he called the cops?

01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:16.890
One hour? Three?
I had no choice.

01:23:17.940 --> 01:23:20.020
Alright?
He would've found me.

01:23:34.630 --> 01:23:36.170
Jesus Christ.

01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:40.040
You were into the accountant.

01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:43.340
You for real?

01:23:50.270 --> 01:23:51.810
That was stupid.

01:23:55.850 --> 01:23:56.890
Fuck.

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:06.780
I'm sorry.

01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:10.830
I'm sorry.

01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:15.830
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:21.410
It just caught me by surprise.

01:24:25.630 --> 01:24:28.750
You'll feel fine later
with all that cash. Trust me.

01:24:31.810 --> 01:24:33.880
Buy you a nice
leather bag to put it in.

01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:41.520
We'll take the night train to Paris.
Have some fois gras at Le Bouclard...

01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:48.110
then mosey on down to Nice.
Work on our tans.

01:24:49.570 --> 01:24:53.740
Buy a yacht.
We can name it Jonathan.

01:24:57.410 --> 01:25:02.460
(singing) My baby loves me,
she always makes me feel fine.

01:25:02.710 --> 01:25:06.410
She loves me,
she lets me know that she's mine.

01:25:06.590 --> 01:25:08.300
And when she kisses...

01:25:08.970 --> 01:25:12.750
And then I ask her
if everything is okay,

01:25:13.050 --> 01:25:16.840
I get my answer,
the only thing I can say,

01:25:17.180 --> 01:25:19.640
I say "Yeah, yeah."
Your turn.

01:25:26.070 --> 01:25:28.560
Say it!
- Yeah, yeah...

01:25:30.150 --> 01:25:31.730
is what I say.

01:25:32.990 --> 01:25:35.070
Oh, what I'm gonna do to you.

01:25:57.600 --> 01:25:59.670
(music)

01:26:13.570 --> 01:26:15.650
(music)

01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:45.120
I have an appointment
with Mr. Ruiz. Ruiz?

01:26:45.130 --> 01:26:46.180
Ruiz, that's right.

01:26:46.270 --> 01:26:49.890
Ruiz. I'm Jonathan McQuarry.
- I was told to expect you. One moment.

01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:56.270
McQuarry.

01:26:57.240 --> 01:26:59.100
Okay, this way.
Excuse me.

01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:02.030
The young lady,
she's also on the account?

01:27:02.290 --> 01:27:06.150
No. She's my personal secretary.
- I see.

01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:10.620
Well, only those on the account
are permitted in Mr. Ruiz' offices.

01:27:10.710 --> 01:27:12.330
I do apologize.

01:27:12.420 --> 01:27:15.540
Would you mind if I waited here?
- Wait here if you like.

01:27:18.890 --> 01:27:20.430
This way, please.

01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:34.980
Mr. Lopez-Poline, our Bank Manager.
He will take care of you now.

01:27:35.070 --> 01:27:37.740
Mr. McQuarry. Buenas dias.
- Buenas dias.

01:27:38.780 --> 01:27:41.730
I understand you wish to close
your account with us today.

01:27:41.820 --> 01:27:44.610
I'm afraid so.
I require some extra liquidity.

01:27:44.700 --> 01:27:46.650
Of course.
I need to see your passport

01:27:46.650 --> 01:27:48.700
and you will need to
sign a few documents.

01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:51.040
Here you are.

01:28:05.890 --> 01:28:07.720
Gracias.
- Gracias.

01:28:08.180 --> 01:28:12.100
And tell me, will the co-signer
be joining us shortly?

01:28:13.270 --> 01:28:15.940
Excuse me?
- The co-signer on this account.

01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:19.360
We will need his information as well
before we can release the funds.

01:28:21.990 --> 01:28:24.310
The co-signer.
- Yes, sir.

01:28:24.410 --> 01:28:28.320
When this money was transferred
there was a request for a co-signature

01:28:28.410 --> 01:28:31.330
to release the funds.
I have it right here.

01:28:34.380 --> 01:28:38.700
A Mr. Bose, Wyatt Bose,
is listed on the account as well.

01:28:39.670 --> 01:28:42.920
Wyatt Bose.
- Yes, Mr. McQuarry.

01:28:44.430 --> 01:28:46.550
According to our records

01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:50.090
you yourself requested the co-signature
when you transferred these funds.

01:28:50.770 --> 01:28:54.510
Yes, I know I did, but it's just...

01:28:58.060 --> 01:29:01.730
It's not a problem.
I can sort this out.

01:29:04.900 --> 01:29:08.520
Please tell Mr. Ruiz
I'll be back shortly.

01:29:09.780 --> 01:29:11.530
(bank manager)
Okay.

01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:17.240
(music)

01:29:44.650 --> 01:29:46.730
Hello.
- (Jonathan) Are you free tonight?

01:29:48.570 --> 01:29:51.490
Jonathan.
- I said, are you free tonight?

01:29:53.740 --> 01:29:55.290
Yes, I am.

01:30:07.170 --> 01:30:08.720
Hello, Jonathan.

01:30:16.350 --> 01:30:18.510
My God,
I'm a handsome devil.

01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:23.560
The hair isn't quite right.
You losing some on top, there?

01:30:24.150 --> 01:30:27.270
Regardless, you look well.
- For someone you thought you'd killed.

01:30:29.530 --> 01:30:31.240
I want half.

01:30:32.910 --> 01:30:36.240
Careful. The suit doesn't make
the man, Jonathan.

01:30:36.580 --> 01:30:39.780
I stole 20 million dollars.
I figure I'm entitled to some of it.

01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:45.080
There are two signatures required
to release those funds.

01:30:47.630 --> 01:30:49.700
You thought of everything,
didn't you?

01:30:50.590 --> 01:30:54.590
Without me that money doesn't
move anywhere. I want half.

01:30:59.980 --> 01:31:01.520
Okay.
Let's do it.

01:31:10.530 --> 01:31:12.480
Señor Bose.
- Thank you.

01:31:12.570 --> 01:31:14.060
Señor McQuarry.

01:31:21.950 --> 01:31:24.030
Would you sign there,
Mr. McQuarry, please?

01:31:30.710 --> 01:31:34.160
Two suitcases,
ten million each.

01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:38.710
Well, everything
seems to be in order.

01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:41.920
Mr. McQuarry, Mr. Bose...

01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:45.640
please sign here and here.

01:31:47.770 --> 01:31:50.890
Thank you.
Please follow me.

01:31:58.160 --> 01:31:59.650
All yours.

01:32:06.460 --> 01:32:08.530
(music)

01:32:19.090 --> 01:32:23.140
Well, here we are, Jonathan.
Spain, a suitcase full of money.

01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:27.720
A lot of people would give everything
to feel what we're feeling right now.

01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:31.600
I'm curious.
How did you know you'd been played?

01:32:32.900 --> 01:32:35.390
You made a mistake.
- I made a mistake?

01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:39.190
The photo you sent me
was taken a few weeks ago.

01:32:39.950 --> 01:32:42.020
Before the pipe behind her
caused the stain.

01:32:46.370 --> 01:32:50.700
I knew she was in on it.
- No longer. She took off.

01:32:53.210 --> 01:32:54.750
Where is she?

01:32:55.590 --> 01:32:57.960
She really got under your skin,
didn't she?

01:33:00.930 --> 01:33:04.040
I'll give you half my share
if you tell me where she is.

01:33:04.220 --> 01:33:05.760
Is that so?

01:33:09.560 --> 01:33:11.850
Let's go somewhere
quiet and make a deal.

01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:19.320
She fell for you, Jonathan.
It's true.

01:33:21.860 --> 01:33:23.940
I think she may
have even loved you.

01:33:27.660 --> 01:33:31.280
She's a very special girl, and I think
she's worth more than half your share,

01:33:31.370 --> 01:33:33.280
but then again...

01:34:06.990 --> 01:34:09.450
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

01:34:15.710 --> 01:34:17.780
(music)

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.080
(music)

01:35:23.020 --> 01:35:26.230
Wait! Wait! I need to talk to you.
- No. Get out of here, Jonathan.

01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:28.400
I came here hoping I
would see you again.

01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:29.730
You know nothing about me.

01:35:29.820 --> 01:35:31.900
You don't even know my name.

01:35:32.820 --> 01:35:35.940
So I was just part of the plan,
is that it? Everything.

01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:40.580
I wanted to call it off.
That night in Chinatown.

01:35:41.330 --> 01:35:44.100
I didn't know he was gonna
try to kill you. I'm so sorry.

01:35:44.110 --> 01:35:44.580
Don't go.

01:35:50.130 --> 01:35:51.960
Take care of yourself.
