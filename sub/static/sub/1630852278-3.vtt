00:02.168 --> 00:04.671
- You killed your brother?

00:04.671 --> 00:06.673
I thought he killed himself.

00:06.673 --> 00:09.134
- He was, uh, he
was a drug addict.

00:09.134 --> 00:10.760
- Yeah.

00:12.595 --> 00:16.307
- Ever since high school,
that became his thing.

00:16.307 --> 00:19.936
You know, pot, coke,
X, anything really.

00:19.936 --> 00:23.189
Parents were--were destroyed,

00:23.189 --> 00:26.359
they were screaming,
fighting all the time.

00:26.359 --> 00:27.902
It was awful.

00:27.902 --> 00:30.655
They split up.

00:30.655 --> 00:34.826
And then my dad, he, uh,
he did what he did.

00:36.995 --> 00:39.914
After that, Jeffrey, he--
he blamed himself.

00:39.914 --> 00:42.083
You know, he
couldn't hold a job,

00:42.083 --> 00:44.044
He was-- he was in
and out of rehab,

00:44.044 --> 00:47.213
I don't know, 12, 15 times.

00:47.213 --> 00:49.174
Till I finally said to myself,

00:49.174 --> 00:50.925
you know I gotta
fucking do something.

00:50.925 --> 00:53.553
I gotta--I gotta save him.

00:53.553 --> 00:57.474
And so--and so I narc'd on him.

00:57.474 --> 01:00.477
I-I called the cops,

01:00.477 --> 01:02.854
I told 'em, this guy,
he's in possession of coke,

01:02.854 --> 01:04.689
you should arrest him.

01:04.689 --> 01:06.816
'Cause I'd heard of
people doing that--

01:06.816 --> 01:09.444
you know, getting a loved one
busted so they'd go to jail,

01:09.444 --> 01:11.237
and then he'd be away
from--from drugs, and--

01:13.323 --> 01:14.949
But the cops,
they went to his place, right?

01:14.949 --> 01:17.702
And they raided it
and found all sorts of shit

01:17.702 --> 01:21.081
that I didn't--
I didn't know, man, he was--

01:21.081 --> 01:23.541
They found 1.6 kilos of heroine.

01:23.541 --> 01:25.043
Kay, he was a dealer?

01:25.043 --> 01:26.211
My fucking brother was a dealer.

01:26.211 --> 01:28.046
I had no idea.

01:28.046 --> 01:30.757
The judge gave him ten years.

01:30.757 --> 01:33.426
Okay, he served 6 1/2,
and it was all my fault, kay?

01:35.261 --> 01:38.473
It was all--it was
all because of me.

01:38.473 --> 01:42.852
- ♪ Now, now,
now, now, now ♪

01:42.852 --> 01:45.146
- How'd he react
when you told him?

01:45.146 --> 01:47.524
- He was actually
grateful. - Hm.

01:47.524 --> 01:50.068
- He thanked me for
saving his life.

01:50.068 --> 01:53.404
Recognized that in the
long run this would bring us
closer.

01:53.404 --> 01:56.199
- Really?
- No, not really.

01:56.199 --> 01:58.159
He was fucking
livid. Okay?

01:58.159 --> 02:00.411
He never spoke to me
again. Never spoke to any of us.

02:02.372 --> 02:04.457
But he did write me.

02:04.457 --> 02:07.502
Every day, same letter.

02:07.502 --> 02:11.214
- Do you recall anything
that he wrote in the letter?

02:11.214 --> 02:13.716
- "Can I recall?"
Of course I can recall.

02:13.716 --> 02:15.844
It was the same
words over and over.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.641
Okay, what he said
was--

02:21.641 --> 02:23.476
- Save it.

02:23.476 --> 02:26.896
We're out of time.

02:26.896 --> 02:29.816
- Does the suspense
not ever get to you?

02:29.816 --> 02:31.776
- Nah.

02:31.776 --> 02:33.903
I mean, I know we'll
get to it next time.

02:33.903 --> 02:36.114
Even if it's in the
42nd minute, huh?

02:36.114 --> 02:38.867
Um...

02:38.867 --> 02:40.660
by the way, I now accept Venmo.

02:43.037 --> 02:45.331
And my rate has changed as well.

02:45.331 --> 02:47.292
It's now $160 an hour.

02:48.710 --> 02:51.129
- What, you can just do that?

02:51.129 --> 02:54.090
Raise your rate 10.3%
whenever you want?

03:21.868 --> 03:26.039
- Hal?
- Oh, Eddie, thank God.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.373
Give me a hug, man.
- No.

03:27.373 --> 03:29.417
What is going on, man?

03:29.417 --> 03:32.629
What the fuck happened to my
door, and why aren't you lifting
the seat?

03:32.629 --> 03:33.963
You mind telling us
what the fuck is going on?

03:35.757 --> 03:37.842
- Ah, shi--

03:37.842 --> 03:40.428
- "And Coop, please come by
and get my fish.

03:40.428 --> 03:42.764
I'd like you to have
him." Thank you.

03:42.764 --> 03:45.016
"Remember, just a pinch
of food once a day.

03:45.016 --> 03:47.936
"Not a lump. I call him Fish,

03:47.936 --> 03:49.354
but I guess you could call him
whatever you want."

03:49.354 --> 03:51.314
- Gimme that.

03:51.314 --> 03:53.608
- "And if you can't
find him, don't panic.

03:53.608 --> 03:56.194
He likes to hide behind
the treasure chest."

03:56.194 --> 03:57.570
You were gonna fucking
kill yourself!?

03:57.570 --> 03:59.489
- No.

03:59.489 --> 04:00.990
- Then why'd you write
me a suicide note?

04:03.117 --> 04:06.329
- Okay, I might have thought
about it, but I didn't do it, so
relax.

04:06.329 --> 04:09.123
- And on the same date
your brother killed himself?

04:09.123 --> 04:10.833
You know this could've done
to your mother?

04:10.833 --> 04:13.253
- I know, I know.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.420
That's why I couldn't
go through with it.

04:14.420 --> 04:17.799
- Jesus, Ed.
This is fucked up.

04:17.799 --> 04:19.842
You wrote a three-page
suicide note,

04:19.842 --> 04:22.845
and 2/3rds of it
is about your fish.

04:22.845 --> 04:25.056
- Yeah, probably should've
put more thought into it.

04:26.891 --> 04:29.602
Maybe I just have
the Hemmingway gene.

04:29.602 --> 04:31.938
I mean, my dad, my brother...

04:31.938 --> 04:34.607
- Man, get the fuck outta here.
I don't wanna hear that shit.

04:34.607 --> 04:38.111
Just because they killed
themselves you feel like you
have to?

04:38.111 --> 04:41.155
- Hey, look, I'm--I'm okay now.

04:41.155 --> 04:44.409
Okay, and I'm--I'm sorry
for scaring you guys.

04:44.409 --> 04:46.452
- I just...

04:46.452 --> 04:48.454
just don't understand why you
sent him a suicide note

04:48.454 --> 04:50.999
and not me one.

04:50.999 --> 04:53.001
- Well, I knew he'd
read it to you.

04:53.001 --> 04:55.128
- But why not send
one to both of us?

04:55.128 --> 04:58.214
- Are you fucking kidding me?
It's a suicide note.

04:58.214 --> 05:00.675
All right? It's not
a fucking Evite.

05:00.675 --> 05:02.593
- Take care of a fish.

05:02.593 --> 05:04.971
I've taken care of fish before.
- Hal.

05:04.971 --> 05:08.308
I-I was a little depressed
at the time, okay?

05:08.308 --> 05:10.643
I-I haven't exactly had
the greatest couple of years,

05:10.643 --> 05:14.647
and I just didn't have the
energy to write two suicide
notes.

05:14.647 --> 05:17.233
- I mean, you could've just
typed it up on your computer

05:17.233 --> 05:20.069
and then printed out two copies
and mailed them both.

05:20.069 --> 05:22.322
Probably would've been easier
than handwriting it anyways.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.574
- Yeah, I guess I could've,

05:24.574 --> 05:27.327
but I-I know you're
not a reader anyway.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.496
- I-I definitely would've
at least skimmed it.

05:30.496 --> 05:32.832
- Okay, okay, but, man,
you have to understand...

05:35.168 --> 05:38.004
Is that my watch?

05:38.004 --> 05:42.175
- Oh, uh, yeah, sorry, I just--

05:42.175 --> 05:44.844
you know, would've wanted
something to remember you by

05:44.844 --> 05:49.182
if you were gonna be gone,
just 'cause, you know,

05:49.182 --> 05:51.768
you didn't give me the courtesy
of a suicide note.

05:54.729 --> 05:56.606
- I'm sorry, okay?

05:56.606 --> 05:59.525
Guys, I'm sorry, but...

05:59.525 --> 06:01.944
there's a silver
lining, all right?

06:01.944 --> 06:05.615
This whole thing, it made me
realize that I have to get
Kendra back.

06:05.615 --> 06:07.784
- What?
- How?

06:07.784 --> 06:09.577
- Are you fucking nuts?
She cheated on you.

06:09.577 --> 06:10.995
- No, no.
That's on me.

06:10.995 --> 06:13.664
I forced her to cheat. I--

06:13.664 --> 06:14.957
- What are you talking about?
- I didn't treat her right.

06:14.957 --> 06:17.418
I was--I was complacent, kay?

06:17.418 --> 06:19.545
You can't blame everything bad
that happened on her.

06:19.545 --> 06:21.964
- Yeah, you can!

06:21.964 --> 06:24.342
You found out she was boning
Kyle-- that put you in a funk,

06:24.342 --> 06:26.761
he takes your spot
as top trader at the firm,

06:26.761 --> 06:29.847
you go rogue, you
exceed your trade limit,

06:29.847 --> 06:31.849
blow out, get arrested,

06:31.849 --> 06:35.395
have a huge picture
in handcuffs in the "Trib."

06:35.395 --> 06:37.146
- The "Trib"--wait, the "Trib"?

06:37.146 --> 06:38.231
You read the "Trib"?
You were in the "Trib"?

06:38.231 --> 06:39.982
- He was in all the papers.

06:39.982 --> 06:41.859
- No, I know that,
but you made the "Trib"?

06:41.859 --> 06:44.570
- Look guys, all I know is that
when I was with Kendra

06:44.570 --> 06:46.656
everything was fucking great.
I was on top.

06:46.656 --> 06:49.700
And then she left me,
and it all went to shit,

06:49.700 --> 06:52.245
so I'm gonna do everything
I can to get her back.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.205
- What the hell happened here?

06:55.790 --> 06:57.959
I-I forgot my keys, so...

07:00.253 --> 07:02.213
- Hi, Maxine.
- Hello, Coop.

07:02.213 --> 07:05.341
- Yeah.
Hi, Mrs. Poole.

07:05.341 --> 07:08.302
So sorry again, about the
whole thing with Jeffrey

07:08.302 --> 07:12.056
not being...alive anymore.

07:14.517 --> 07:15.601
- What the fuck
is wrong with you?

07:15.601 --> 07:17.353
- It's okay, Hal.

07:17.353 --> 07:19.439
Nobody knows what to say
when someone dies.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.066
People act all weird around you
and say stupid shit.

07:22.066 --> 07:25.695
On the plus side,
people are very nice.

07:25.695 --> 07:28.781
Lady down at Donut Delite
just gave me free coffee.

07:28.781 --> 07:30.825
So that's a fair trade.

07:30.825 --> 07:33.411
Lose a son, gain a coffee.

07:33.411 --> 07:37.039
- Well, I wouldn't say fair.

07:37.039 --> 07:39.041
- Uh, Maxine, we're gonna, uh,
quickly go.

07:42.962 --> 07:44.130
- What the fuck
is the matter with you?

07:46.215 --> 07:48.426
-
How you doing?

07:48.426 --> 07:50.595
- I'm great.

07:50.595 --> 07:52.930
How the fuck do you
think I'm doing?

07:52.930 --> 07:55.349
I was already so stressed
trying to sell the company.

07:55.349 --> 07:57.852
Then this.

07:57.852 --> 08:00.021
- Then maybe we shouldn't be
selling the company right now.

08:00.021 --> 08:02.482
- I did not come here to talk
about the tractor business.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.943
A couple of things. First...

08:05.943 --> 08:09.572
I need you to go down to the
impound and pick up Jeffrey's
car.

08:09.572 --> 08:12.325
- Okay.

08:12.325 --> 08:15.703
- I explained to them why it had
been left abandoned on the
bridge--

08:15.703 --> 08:18.372
because Jeffrey
jumped off of it,

08:18.372 --> 08:21.125
and they were nice enough to
give me a 10% "death discount."

08:21.125 --> 08:26.631
So Jeffrey's suicide is going
to cost us $210 versus $230.

08:26.631 --> 08:29.592
The address is in there.
You can keep the change.

08:29.592 --> 08:32.094
- They weren't that nice, Ma.

08:32.094 --> 08:36.432
10% would've been $207.
- You do not get to be glib.

08:36.432 --> 08:39.519
I really need you to come
downstairs with me

08:39.519 --> 08:41.395
and reprogram my radio stations.

08:41.395 --> 08:43.105
- What?
Why?

08:43.105 --> 08:46.234
- Well, I treated
myself to an oil change,

08:46.234 --> 08:48.861
and they did something
and messed everything up

08:48.861 --> 08:51.948
and erased all my favorites.
- All right, all right.

08:51.948 --> 08:54.992
- I'm parked right in
front, so...come on.

08:54.992 --> 08:56.869
Honey, I'm just gonna
pop in the ladies room.

08:56.869 --> 08:58.454
I'll be right behind you.

09:19.058 --> 09:20.851
Oh, Lord.

09:27.608 --> 09:29.777
Oh, my--

09:32.613 --> 09:34.615
- Oh,
- Ma.

09:34.615 --> 09:37.034
Ma, I need your keys.

09:37.034 --> 09:39.245
- Is this why your
brother killed himself?
