will be entitled
to retain her employment

19:45.372 --> 19:46.497
push it to the t--

19:49.372 --> 19:51.414
Oh, my God,
did I say that out loud?

19:51.497 --> 19:53.455
( rapping )
Your smile like Crest,

19:53.539 --> 19:55.247
let me just finesse,

19:55.330 --> 19:56.497
that's all I got!

19:56.581 --> 19:59.289
Oh, my God,
we're amazing!

19:59.372 --> 20:02.664
Yo, we should start a group
and perform at Coachella.

20:02.747 --> 20:04.913
I play the triangle!

20:04.997 --> 20:08.372
Yo, it would be so cool
if Inglewood had
something like this.

20:08.455 --> 20:10.289
Can you imagine?

20:10.372 --> 20:13.289
It would be so dope
to just hose down
a couple streets,

20:13.372 --> 20:14.872
make it a local thing...

20:14.955 --> 20:16.872
Yeah?
What would you call it?

20:16.955 --> 20:18.831
Ingle-chella.

20:18.913 --> 20:20.581
No. That's terrible.

20:20.664 --> 20:22.497
( gasps )

20:22.581 --> 20:24.289
Cocoa-chella.

20:24.372 --> 20:27.330
Yeah, because of
all the chocolaty people!

20:27.414 --> 20:28.622
Uh-huh.

20:28.706 --> 20:30.455
- That's dope.
- That's...

20:30.539 --> 20:34.289
( gasps ) Ooh!
I love Ferris wheels!

20:34.372 --> 20:35.747
Issa: Yes!

20:35.831 --> 20:37.289
Attendant:
Y'all have fun.
Watch your step.

20:37.372 --> 20:38.872
- Issa: We will!
- Nathan: Thank you.

20:41.872 --> 20:43.581
Are you ready, though?

20:43.664 --> 20:45.497
If you are.

20:49.414 --> 20:53.455
Yeah. I'm... scared.

20:53.539 --> 20:54.747
( laughs ) Don't be!

20:54.831 --> 20:57.622
It's not that high.
But we are.

20:57.706 --> 20:58.955
( laughs )

20:59.038 --> 21:01.831
Also it goes pretty slow,
so you good.

21:01.913 --> 21:04.372
You be knowin' shit.

21:04.455 --> 21:06.581
You're amazing.

21:06.664 --> 21:09.581
Pfft! I am not.

21:09.664 --> 21:10.997
Trust me.

21:11.080 --> 21:12.622
Why you say it like that?

21:12.706 --> 21:14.831
( stammers )

21:14.913 --> 21:17.038
I quit my job.

21:17.122 --> 21:19.622
And I keep frontin'
to everybody

21:19.706 --> 21:22.455
like I'm not scared
about what's next for me,

21:22.539 --> 21:24.747
but I am terrified.

21:27.789 --> 21:31.455
Well, I mean,
you still gonna do
something with music?

21:37.122 --> 21:38.247
Hey.

21:39.706 --> 21:42.622
I think quittin' your job
was real brave.

21:44.622 --> 21:46.872
You gonna come out of this
in a better place.

21:46.955 --> 21:48.955
I know it.

21:51.747 --> 21:53.372
- ( clank )
- Nathan: Oh, shit.

21:53.455 --> 21:55.038
- What?!
- Oh, shit fuck.

21:55.122 --> 21:57.539
Shit fuck da-da-da. No-no-no.

21:57.622 --> 21:58.872
What just happened?

21:58.955 --> 22:01.372
- ( laughs )
- Why you laughin'?

22:01.455 --> 22:03.789
- You're so scared.
- Attendant: It's all good.

22:03.872 --> 22:06.289
Just gonna get
a backup battery.

22:06.372 --> 22:07.622
I'm not high.

22:09.455 --> 22:11.789
Well, you know, at least...

22:11.913 --> 22:13.997
at least it's a good view.

22:28.913 --> 22:31.872

22:33.831 --> 22:36.455

Who took my other waffle?!

23:19.747 --> 23:21.122
You ate it
before we left the tent.

23:21.205 --> 23:22.539
Oh, my bad.

23:25.497 --> 23:27.622
White folks
just don't give a fuck!

23:27.706 --> 23:29.997
Wait. Where's my jacket?

23:30.080 --> 23:32.747
How y'all gonna just
take our spot?

23:32.831 --> 23:35.664
- There's no savin' spots.
- Yeah, it's a field.

23:35.747 --> 23:37.163
And I'll bet that's where
you'd like to keep us,

23:37.247 --> 23:38.831
you whole milk-drinking bitch!

23:38.913 --> 23:41.997
Oh, my God!
Calm down.

23:42.080 --> 23:44.080
- All these first-timers.
- ( man laughs )

23:45.706 --> 23:46.997
This about to be
the first time

23:47.080 --> 23:47.997
you get chopped
in the throat!

23:48.080 --> 23:49.622
Oh, shit!

23:49.706 --> 23:51.497
No! No!
No, Kelli, no!

23:51.581 --> 23:53.497
Oh, shit!

23:53.581 --> 23:55.913
( all shouting )

23:55.997 --> 23:58.872
( shouting )

23:58.955 --> 24:00.997
Oh, no! Not today!

24:01.080 --> 24:03.539
( shouting continues )

24:03.622 --> 24:06.872
Oh, my God!
Stop! Stop!

24:06.955 --> 24:10.038
I'm reclaiming
my time and my space!

24:10.122 --> 24:13.455
I came with my friends
to listen to white music!

24:13.539 --> 24:16.664
I'll bet you voted
for Jill Stein!

24:16.747 --> 24:19.122
You are an idiot!

24:19.205 --> 24:22.038
We're gonna miss Beyoncé!

24:22.122 --> 24:24.872
No! Guys! Hey!

24:24.955 --> 24:26.706
You better not touch her,
she a lawyer!

24:26.789 --> 24:27.747
She a lawyer!

24:32.539 --> 24:34.622
- ( Ferris wheel powers up )
- Nathan: Oh, shit.

24:34.706 --> 24:36.163
( Issa laughs )

24:36.247 --> 24:38.122
Issa:
Great timing.

24:39.872 --> 24:41.706
Does this count
as the Mile High Club?

24:41.789 --> 24:43.789
It better.

24:43.872 --> 24:47.539
- ( both laugh )
- ( phone buzzing )

24:47.622 --> 24:49.789
Oh, shit,
I got service up here!

24:49.872 --> 24:51.622
Hello?

24:53.289 --> 24:56.205
Tiffany, slow down.
I can't hear you.

24:56.289 --> 24:57.664
Where?

24:58.872 --> 25:00.038
What?

25:00.122 --> 25:01.997
OK, I'll be right there.

25:04.163 --> 25:07.289
This is so embarrassing!
Is everybody looking at us?

25:07.372 --> 25:09.913
Why do the whites
get to stay? Huh?

25:09.997 --> 25:13.955
I know why.
'Cause they're white, white,
white, white, whiter, white!

25:14.038 --> 25:15.581
Hey, Kelli, we should
probably just go.

25:15.664 --> 25:18.747
- ( drums play intro )
- Oh!

25:18.831 --> 25:21.205
- Molly: Ohh!
- That's Beyoncé!

25:21.289 --> 25:22.747
We came to see that bitch!

25:22.831 --> 25:23.913
Fuck it.

25:23.997 --> 25:25.163
We said Beyoncé or b--

25:25.247 --> 25:26.913
( zap )

25:26.997 --> 25:28.747
( Taser crackling )

25:28.831 --> 25:31.247
- ( Kelli gibbering )
- Oh, shit!

25:31.330 --> 25:33.038
Fuck! Shit! Oh!

25:33.122 --> 25:35.539
Oh, my God, Kelli,
oh, my God!

25:35.622 --> 25:37.664
Molly:
Kelli, are you OK?

25:37.747 --> 25:39.789
Tiffany:
Oh, my God, Kelli!

25:39.913 --> 25:40.997
Oh, my God!

25:41.080 --> 25:42.080
Kelli:
I pissed myself.

25:42.163 --> 25:43.997
Don't look at me.

25:44.080 --> 25:45.872
Remember me different.

25:47.080 --> 25:48.955
( grunting )

25:49.038 --> 25:50.872
( phone chiming, buzzing )

25:50.955 --> 25:52.122
Oh, shit.

25:52.205 --> 25:54.581
We got cell service
out here.

25:54.664 --> 25:56.831
- Damn it!
- What happened now?

25:56.913 --> 25:58.997
I got all these
last-minute notes!

25:59.080 --> 26:02.289
Now Taurean's ass
gonna save the day
and steal my shine.

26:02.372 --> 26:05.955
Does anybody got a laptop?!

26:06.038 --> 26:08.289
- ( sighs )
- ( camera clicks )

26:08.372 --> 26:11.789
We need to get back to the house
right the fuck now.

26:11.872 --> 26:14.747
You guys, I took a bite
of the weed brownie.

26:14.831 --> 26:16.038
Don't judge me!

26:18.872 --> 26:20.997
Issa:
I just feel so bad
'cause I was the one

26:21.080 --> 26:22.789
who changed the schedule,

26:22.872 --> 26:24.289
I was the one
who abandoned them.

26:24.372 --> 26:26.163
Don't stress.
They'll be OK.

26:26.247 --> 26:29.205
Hey, let's just go inside,
all right?

26:29.289 --> 26:34.163
I probably need
to go inside myself,
'cause I fucked everything up.

26:34.247 --> 26:37.581
OK. I had a great time,
though.

26:37.664 --> 26:38.913
Me too.

26:42.831 --> 26:44.080
I'll hit you tomorrow.

26:47.664 --> 26:49.289
( blows air )

26:49.372 --> 26:51.831
- ( rapid typing )
- Oh, my God,

26:51.913 --> 26:53.872
are y'all OK?
Are y'all mad at me?

26:53.955 --> 26:56.997
How am I OK?
I missed Beyoncé,
I pissed myself--

26:57.080 --> 26:59.622
- I got tackled today, Issa.
- So you are mad at me.

26:59.706 --> 27:02.872
I just gotta send in this brief.
Gotta send an edit
and then I send an email.

27:02.955 --> 27:04.955
- Girl, you are typing so hard.
- This is business, Issa.

27:05.038 --> 27:07.080
- This is my life.
- You're on drugs! Stop typing!

27:07.163 --> 27:10.163
- I gotta send in this brief!
- Aah!

27:10.247 --> 27:13.706
I don't know
what this shit means,
but I know it's wrong.

27:13.789 --> 27:16.080
I don't wanna be high no more.

27:16.163 --> 27:19.080
'Cause it's hot,
and I don't know what happened
to my jacket.

27:19.163 --> 27:22.163
I'm on fire!
Can someone please help me
take my hair out?

27:22.247 --> 27:25.372
Stop it, stop it.
Kelli, where's Tiffany?
Is she mad at me?

27:25.455 --> 27:28.289
I don't know.
She hide in the closet.

27:28.372 --> 27:32.163
Tiffany:
Yes, I know
he's our little weed baby!

27:32.247 --> 27:33.414
( Tiffany crying )

27:33.497 --> 27:36.289
But I just wanna
be home with you!

27:36.372 --> 27:39.913
- ( sobbing )
- Hey, Derek.

27:39.997 --> 27:43.997
She just had a little pinch,
we got everything
under control. OK, bye.

27:44.080 --> 27:46.955
Why did you just
hang up on my husband?!

27:47.038 --> 27:48.747
Because you're all mad at me
and we need to talk!

27:48.831 --> 27:50.289
( sobbing )

27:50.372 --> 27:52.747
Now you wanna talk?
Now  you wanna talk?!

27:52.831 --> 27:54.747
When you left me alone
to battle the whites
in the field,

27:54.831 --> 27:56.997
what happened to
"Beyoncé or bust"?

27:57.080 --> 28:00.831
Beyoncé is
a better mother than me!

28:00.913 --> 28:05.455
( sobbing ) This closet
is so well organized.

28:05.539 --> 28:08.289
Tiffany, come out the closet.
Molly, stop breathing so hard.

28:08.372 --> 28:10.247
Kelli, stop glaring at me
like you want me to die.

28:10.330 --> 28:13.789
It's residual Tase rage, bitch!
It's an after-effect.

28:13.872 --> 28:16.455
You mean side effect.

28:16.539 --> 28:18.247
Now who's a scientist?

28:18.330 --> 28:20.080
Bitch, shut up!

28:20.163 --> 28:22.122
Yo, who took my jacket?

28:22.205 --> 28:24.247
Who the fuck took my jacket?

28:24.330 --> 28:27.831
Issa:
Y'all, the drugs and the heat
are fuckin' us up.

28:27.913 --> 28:30.455
We're all mad at me,
and we just need
to go to bed, OK?

28:30.539 --> 28:33.289
( crying )

28:33.372 --> 28:35.372
( birds chirping )

28:40.789 --> 28:42.372
Tiffany:
I need water.

28:42.455 --> 28:44.997
Do we have water?

28:45.080 --> 28:47.205
Check the fridge.

28:53.497 --> 28:55.955
( grunts )

28:56.038 --> 28:57.747
Why am I in a zebra?

29:00.080 --> 29:02.163
Kelli:
My whole fuckin' body hurts.

29:07.414 --> 29:10.247
( all laughing )

29:10.330 --> 29:12.497
What the fuck
happened to your hair?

29:12.581 --> 29:14.789
Nigga,
a track is missin'.

29:14.872 --> 29:17.789
I tried to take it out,
it got caught up
on my ring.

29:17.872 --> 29:20.122
Oh, God.

29:20.205 --> 29:22.163
Issa:
Is everybody OK, though?

29:22.247 --> 29:24.414
We were all high as fuck.

29:24.497 --> 29:26.414
I was so  high.

29:26.497 --> 29:27.913
I thought I got Tased.

29:27.997 --> 29:29.122
( laughs )

29:29.205 --> 29:32.289
( continues laughing )

29:32.372 --> 29:34.038
Oh, shit.

29:34.122 --> 29:35.706
Ohh.

29:36.913 --> 29:38.163
Tiff, did you find water?

29:38.247 --> 29:41.247
No. All we have is vodka.

29:41.330 --> 29:45.038
Well, I can go to the store.
You wanna come?

29:47.455 --> 29:49.913
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

29:52.163 --> 29:53.955
( grunting )

29:56.497 --> 29:58.289
Why I smell like piss?

30:12.955 --> 30:15.831
So, I'ma just run inside
real quick.

30:15.913 --> 30:17.455
You wanna stay in the car?

30:17.539 --> 30:18.497
Yeah.

30:20.205 --> 30:22.997
You feelin' better?

30:23.080 --> 30:24.747
What's wrong?

30:26.581 --> 30:28.997
I don't know.

30:29.080 --> 30:31.872
I don't want to be dramatic.

30:31.955 --> 30:36.414
But it's like last night
and ever since I got pregnant,

30:36.497 --> 30:39.163
I just feel so left out.

30:42.163 --> 30:45.913
It's like I really pushed myself
to party with y'all.

30:45.997 --> 30:49.831
Girl, we just wanted
one last hurrah
before the baby came.

30:51.497 --> 30:56.038
It's just...
everything's different now.

30:57.955 --> 30:59.163
Like, we're different now.

31:01.163 --> 31:03.455
We don't have to be.

31:05.581 --> 31:08.330
Shit changes all the time.
It's--

31:10.330 --> 31:11.997
And we'll always be friends.
