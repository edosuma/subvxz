NETFLIX PRESENTS

02:53.338 --> 03:00.130
MAIN TITLE

03:21.255 --> 03:25.130
I remember that 30 years ago,
this place was a part of the sea.

03:25.963 --> 03:28.505
It's nothing but reclaimed land now.

03:29.171 --> 03:34.088
In 30 years, even the ports of Keppel
and Tanjong Pagar will move here.

03:34.255 --> 03:35.130
Look.

03:39.505 --> 03:41.338
How do you remember...

03:42.546 --> 03:43.921
what it was like 30 years ago?

03:56.630 --> 04:01.171
Where's the driver of the missing truck?
I want to question him.

04:01.380 --> 04:03.380
Wang? I haven't seen him.

04:04.796 --> 04:07.005
Is he coming to the site today?

04:07.421 --> 04:11.546
Maybe. See how many workers
we have here, officer?

04:11.921 --> 04:14.963
They come to work if they want
to get paid.

04:17.505 --> 04:19.588
Officer, my nephew, Jason.

04:21.213 --> 04:24.296
This officer is looking for
Wang's contact information. Help him out.

04:26.380 --> 04:29.630
They often use prepaid numbers
and change without notifying us.

04:34.005 --> 04:35.046
-Uncle.
-Yes.

04:35.130 --> 04:37.255
Please check out this blue-colored file.

04:37.338 --> 04:38.838
The project is going to start tomorrow.

04:38.921 --> 04:40.713
I'll let you know later.

04:40.963 --> 04:43.380
Also, Ali was looking for you just now
when you weren't around.

04:43.463 --> 04:45.046
Wang hasn't come to work in a week.

04:45.755 --> 04:47.046
That bastard!

04:48.130 --> 04:51.088
I was so kind to give him an easy job.

04:51.838 --> 04:53.338
I should have sent him back to China.

04:55.671 --> 04:58.713
They seem to come to work
as and when they like.

04:59.380 --> 05:01.421
It's pretty relaxed here, right?

05:01.880 --> 05:03.005
Officer.

05:03.630 --> 05:05.588
Don't cause me any trouble, okay?

05:08.796 --> 05:09.671
Okay?

05:11.796 --> 05:13.005
I can guarantee you

05:14.005 --> 05:16.255
it's not at all relaxed here.

05:17.046 --> 05:19.213
Got the number you wanted?

05:19.713 --> 05:20.796
-Jason.
-Yes?

05:20.880 --> 05:23.171
Can I trouble you
to send this officer out?

05:26.255 --> 05:27.880
Come over.

05:27.963 --> 05:30.671
-If got any problem, come over.
-Your uncle's got a sense of humor.

05:32.171 --> 05:33.463
Wang didn't fill up the logbook.

05:34.505 --> 05:35.755
He didn't keep a log?

05:36.463 --> 05:37.796
He drives the company truck.

05:38.380 --> 05:40.880
He didn't come to work.
Aren't you afraid he'd run off?

05:41.880 --> 05:43.755
We hold on to their passports.

05:48.046 --> 05:49.171
In case they lose it.

06:18.963 --> 06:20.505
How do people live like this?

06:36.088 --> 06:37.171
There.

06:51.338 --> 06:52.630
Careful of the bedbugs.

07:15.921 --> 07:18.255
Is there a Wang Bicheng here?

07:24.130 --> 07:25.005
Hey.

07:27.630 --> 07:28.880
We're talking to you.

07:30.713 --> 07:31.630
Hey.

07:31.796 --> 07:32.963
Where does Wang Bicheng sleep?

07:33.546 --> 07:34.380
Hey.

07:39.796 --> 07:41.963
When did you last see him?

07:42.046 --> 07:43.005
I don't know.

07:43.588 --> 07:45.755
Damn it, how do you not know?
You sleep right across him.

07:46.171 --> 07:48.380
I'm not his mother. How would I know?

07:49.255 --> 07:50.713
You have no manners!

07:51.005 --> 07:53.296
For fuck's sake!
What the hell is wrong with you?

07:54.505 --> 07:56.421
He didn't come back at all last night.

07:57.755 --> 07:58.838
What about the night before?

08:00.088 --> 08:01.421
How would I know?
So many stupid questions.

08:03.880 --> 08:05.296
He doesn't sleep here.

08:05.963 --> 08:07.630
If not here, where then?

08:07.713 --> 08:09.005
Who knows?

08:09.255 --> 08:11.296
He's out almost every night.

08:12.963 --> 08:13.921
Sleeping pills.

08:15.171 --> 08:17.213
With all that physical labor in the day,

08:17.588 --> 08:18.630
how is he still sleepless?

08:19.338 --> 08:20.505
Why wouldn't he be?

08:20.588 --> 08:23.130
After he broke his arm,
he could only drive.

08:23.755 --> 08:25.838
Unlike us, suffering hardship.

08:26.171 --> 08:27.630
I wish I had his life.

08:28.463 --> 08:30.505
Do you want to break a limb too?
I can help.

08:34.421 --> 08:37.046
Sorry to disturb you.

08:43.380 --> 08:45.338
Haven't you been
to the land reclamation site?

08:46.130 --> 08:48.880
Go ask the blackies there.

08:49.005 --> 08:51.213
Wang is good friends with one of them.

09:11.213 --> 09:12.213
It's so bright here.

09:14.755 --> 09:15.838
How do they sleep?

10:23.171 --> 10:25.296
Hey, where's Ajit?

10:29.046 --> 10:31.588
Ajit is not here. He might come later.

10:31.921 --> 10:33.505
Okay, sit down. Come.

11:49.171 --> 11:52.130
KANGNINGDA MEDICINE

11:52.213 --> 11:56.130
DIAZEPAM

14:54.171 --> 14:55.255
Are you unable to sleep too?

14:57.421 --> 14:58.463
Fuck.

15:21.588 --> 15:25.505
24 HOURS E-LOVER CYBERCAFE

15:53.588 --> 15:54.838
How many hours?

15:56.296 --> 15:57.463
I am just looking around.

16:00.755 --> 16:02.296
The air-conditioning is not free here.

16:17.380 --> 16:18.338
Sorry about that.

17:32.005 --> 17:33.796
<i>Ajit didn't return</i>
<i>to the dormitory last night.</i>

17:35.755 --> 17:37.588
<i>Wang Bicheng's phone can't be reached.</i>

17:38.671 --> 17:40.546
<i>It's like the two vanished</i>

17:42.380 --> 17:43.755
and no one is looking for them.

17:45.505 --> 17:47.338
Except us two idiots.

17:49.421 --> 17:51.963
We're paid by the taxpayers,
working for the state,

17:52.046 --> 17:55.296
to look for two workers where no one
is sure whether they are dead or alive.

17:58.463 --> 17:59.755
Do you think they're dead?

18:00.171 --> 18:01.921
So you think they are alive?

18:05.546 --> 18:06.630
Crap!

18:08.380 --> 18:11.046
What, never seen a nosebleed before?
It's hot out here.

18:13.005 --> 18:15.463
Do you think they have the luxury
to skip work?

18:15.838 --> 18:18.838
A few days' wages is a fortune to them.

18:18.963 --> 18:20.921
So, are they dead or alive?
What do you think?

18:27.755 --> 18:29.338
I dreamed of Wang Bicheng last night.

18:31.088 --> 18:32.838
How would you know it was him?

18:32.921 --> 18:35.546
You've never met nor spoken to him.

18:38.255 --> 18:40.088
<i>I used to dream a lot when I was young.</i>

18:41.505 --> 18:44.380
<i>I dreamed of all these bizarre things</i>
<i>and mysterious places</i>

18:46.088 --> 18:48.046
<i>and I thought I was very imaginative.</i>

18:49.588 --> 18:52.963
<i>After I grew up and started traveling,</i>
<i>I realized then</i>

18:53.963 --> 18:57.255
<i>I had been to all those places before,</i>
<i>in my dreams.</i>

18:57.796 --> 19:02.671
<i>The strange thing is, I never actually saw</i>
<i>those places as a child.</i>

19:08.546 --> 19:12.380
You want to know how I knew
I was Wang Bicheng in the dream?

19:28.880 --> 19:31.213
Call the ambulance!

19:31.296 --> 19:33.046
Why are you so careless?

19:33.130 --> 19:35.296
Are your fingers still intact?
The rest, go back to work!

19:35.796 --> 19:38.880
Ajit, you stay here with him.
Make sure nobody touches him, okay?

20:08.255 --> 20:09.963
Wait a little longer, he'll be back soon.

20:27.005 --> 20:27.880
Does it still hurt?

20:29.713 --> 20:31.588
Hey, did you lose your tongue?

20:34.421 --> 20:36.755
Man, you screamed like a bitch earlier.

20:38.338 --> 20:39.796
Come, let me take a look.

20:41.796 --> 20:42.713
Can you feel anything?

20:45.713 --> 20:46.755
What did the doctor say?

20:49.421 --> 20:50.255
Jason.

20:51.921 --> 20:53.963
How long did the doctor say he will need?

20:56.255 --> 21:00.880
The doctor said it will take
three to four weeks with proper care.

21:02.046 --> 21:04.005
Guess we won't have to replace him.

21:04.546 --> 21:06.796
Just call him back to work
after his recovery.

21:09.505 --> 21:11.630
Then what should he do in the meantime?

21:12.671 --> 21:15.088
How should I know?
Tell him to take a vacation.

21:15.963 --> 21:18.296
He's only been in Singapore
for half a year.

21:18.671 --> 21:20.505
Tell him to go to Sentosa Resort Island

21:20.796 --> 21:23.838
with beaches, babes and the casino there.

21:24.505 --> 21:26.005
I don't know! Whatever he likes.

21:29.255 --> 21:30.213
-Uncle.
-Yes?

21:30.380 --> 21:33.588
What if he helps me drive the truck
to fetch the Bangladeshis?

21:33.963 --> 21:36.213
So that I can spend more time on site?

21:41.255 --> 21:42.088
Hey!

21:42.171 --> 21:43.796
Can you drive with that arm?

21:46.130 --> 21:49.546
We only cover your medical costs,
not your funeral.

21:49.838 --> 21:51.088
Yes, I can do it.

21:52.796 --> 21:53.838
Let's set this straight.

21:54.755 --> 21:55.963
It's going to be half your pay.

21:56.338 --> 21:58.046
Don't come back to me later whining.

22:32.796 --> 22:35.213
24 HOURS E-LOVER CYBERCAFE

23:52.880 --> 23:55.921
I only need to adjust something
on my computer.

23:56.588 --> 23:57.921
Isn't that stimulating?

24:01.671 --> 24:02.671
Video call?

24:04.046 --> 24:05.005
Gaming?

24:06.296 --> 24:07.296
Pornography?

24:12.255 --> 24:13.338
Watch a film then.

24:13.630 --> 24:15.213
The air-conditioning is not free here.

24:22.046 --> 24:23.046
Chinese films,

24:23.463 --> 24:24.505
American,

24:25.130 --> 24:26.213
Bollywood.

24:27.671 --> 24:29.380
We don't have porn though.

24:32.338 --> 24:34.088
But if you want to watch,

24:34.421 --> 24:35.421
I'll help you look for it.
Pick a computer.

24:58.255 --> 24:59.546
I'll pick the film.

25:38.630 --> 25:40.255
When are you going home?

25:40.338 --> 25:43.713
After I get paid.

26:11.421 --> 26:12.380
Thank you.

26:17.171 --> 26:19.880
-Did they pay you?
-Yes.

26:21.046 --> 26:23.463
-And you?
-No.

26:25.130 --> 26:28.463
We didn't get this month's salary.

26:29.046 --> 26:33.046
-Did you get a call from home?
-It's already the 13th.

27:22.755 --> 27:24.171
Brother, are you okay?

27:27.463 --> 27:30.505
Guys, come down and help push.

27:30.588 --> 27:32.713
Please get down.

27:35.130 --> 27:37.171
-Please get down.
-Please get down.

27:37.380 --> 27:38.546
Slowly.

27:42.588 --> 27:46.088
Easy...

27:46.171 --> 27:48.255
Keep it to the side.

28:22.630 --> 28:23.463
Ajit.
What?

28:25.380 --> 28:28.088
My name, it's Ajit.

28:29.630 --> 28:30.755
Wang Bicheng.

28:31.338 --> 28:32.338
Wang Bi?

28:32.713 --> 28:33.546
Wang.

28:34.005 --> 28:35.380
-Wang.
-Wang. Okay.

28:35.671 --> 28:37.505
Be careful next time, brother.

28:40.755 --> 28:42.713
Big, small...

28:43.546 --> 28:44.463
Not the same.

28:45.296 --> 28:47.088
No, but they won't see it.

28:49.880 --> 28:52.171
Come help me.

28:59.046 --> 29:02.380
If we get there in time,
the foreman won't know about this.

29:15.880 --> 29:16.880
You can't sleep?

29:18.338 --> 29:19.171
It's itchy.

29:20.130 --> 29:21.588
You'd better sleep.

29:22.213 --> 29:23.588
You have to drive.

29:23.921 --> 29:25.713
Have you slept at all
since you broke your arm?

29:27.546 --> 29:29.255
Look at you. Damn.

29:37.838 --> 29:38.755
Here.

29:38.963 --> 29:40.713
This soothes the bedbug bites.

29:43.005 --> 29:44.421
I just can't reach it.

29:45.130 --> 29:47.630
Use the other hand then.

29:47.963 --> 29:50.255
People like us got to learn to adapt.

29:50.505 --> 29:54.338
By switching between right and left hand,
you will have different pleasures.

29:54.755 --> 29:56.130
Understand?

30:00.921 --> 30:02.755
I say you're a lucky devil.

30:03.088 --> 30:04.880
You know Hao, the crane operator?

30:05.505 --> 30:07.546
He'll be sent back at month's end.

30:07.671 --> 30:09.546
He can forget about coming back.

30:11.046 --> 30:13.255
-He asked me to join him.
-You're lucky

30:13.338 --> 30:15.005
you didn't make the headlines.

30:22.255 --> 30:23.421
Boy, he got it good.

30:24.171 --> 30:28.171
Going home to greet his mother
with a shitload of debt.

30:29.338 --> 30:30.755
He might as well not have come here.

30:33.171 --> 30:39.296
Do you think things would be different
if we had all joined in?

30:41.588 --> 30:43.588
Careful there.

30:44.505 --> 30:46.463
I heard that he's organizing something

30:46.963 --> 30:48.463
to stop the deportation.

30:51.213 --> 30:52.838
Just keep it.

30:53.838 --> 30:58.296
Your tossing and turning
are keeping me up.

30:59.130 --> 31:00.213
That's good then.

31:00.755 --> 31:02.338
Your snoring is so loud.

31:02.546 --> 31:04.046
I'm only doing everyone a favor.

31:05.005 --> 31:06.088
Get lost.

31:33.255 --> 31:35.921
6 PAX

32:05.963 --> 32:06.921
Oh, stop.

32:09.963 --> 32:11.963
Fucking crap!

32:12.671 --> 32:14.963
I didn't pay for this garbage! Fuck!

32:17.421 --> 32:18.338
What are you doing?

32:18.421 --> 32:20.546
<i>-Go, go, go!</i>
-Crap! I'm breaking your shit!

32:20.630 --> 32:22.463
-What's your problem?
-I'll break all these.

32:22.546 --> 32:24.755
I have a lot of money.
I can buy the whole shop!

32:25.338 --> 32:26.296
What are you staring at?

32:26.421 --> 32:30.005
I'll pay you to suck me off,
that should shut you up.

32:30.338 --> 32:34.296
A fucking shop attendant
telling me what to do?

32:34.380 --> 32:35.296
It's three, hurry!

32:35.380 --> 32:36.713
I'm the filthy rich one here!

32:38.505 --> 32:40.380
Over here.

32:40.463 --> 32:42.088
(TERRORIST) TROLL862: SHE'S COMING

32:54.671 --> 32:56.588
Actions speak louder than words.

33:05.088 --> 33:06.463
Is it dead?

33:08.213 --> 33:09.255
Does that excite you?

33:10.421 --> 33:13.546
I see you come here every night
to get killed again and again.

33:13.755 --> 33:16.755
Do you get a kick
out of getting fucked like that?

33:18.046 --> 33:19.588
I can't sleep, that's all.

33:20.005 --> 33:21.213
I can help you with that.

33:24.130 --> 33:25.921
I know hypnosis!

33:27.671 --> 33:28.796
That doesn't work on me.

33:30.421 --> 33:34.838
How do you know
I haven't hypnotized you already?

33:37.546 --> 33:38.630
I really don't need it.

33:39.838 --> 33:41.630
My dormitory is too stuffy,

33:41.921 --> 33:44.671
so I'm looking for
somewhere cooler to sleep.

33:45.671 --> 33:48.296
If it's air-conditioning you want,
you have the truck at the back.

33:52.671 --> 33:54.130
I have a very boring job.

33:54.213 --> 33:56.338
There's a lot of time
to observe people here.

34:02.505 --> 34:04.463
Isn't it stuffy here too?
Let's get some fresh air.

34:05.421 --> 34:07.171
Don't you need to be here?

34:09.005 --> 34:10.005
And do what?

34:10.463 --> 34:12.130
Watch them destroy the computers?

34:52.005 --> 34:53.546
Can you swim with that arm?

35:01.963 --> 35:04.713
If you can beat me,
I'll make it worth your while.

36:37.463 --> 36:39.213
Luckily I turned back to look at you!

36:45.838 --> 36:47.421
Otherwise, you'd have drowned out there.
Do you see those little lights out there?

37:26.671 --> 37:27.755
I was thinking...

37:29.880 --> 37:31.588
If I had swum out to them

37:32.338 --> 37:33.630
and caught a boat,

37:33.880 --> 37:35.630
I could have gotten out of here.

37:37.296 --> 37:38.505
There is no need for visas.

37:39.255 --> 37:40.880
There are no borders.

37:42.796 --> 37:44.630
That's true freedom.

37:48.671 --> 37:50.005
I don't have a boat.

37:51.171 --> 37:52.671
But I have a truck.
Beggars can't be choosers.

38:01.546 --> 38:02.505
I heard...

38:05.130 --> 38:07.213
This area used to be a part of the sea.

38:08.713 --> 38:10.005
Looking at its map,

38:11.171 --> 38:17.005
Singapore's southern coast
is completely straight.

38:17.255 --> 38:19.505
As if someone drew a line.

38:23.880 --> 38:25.921
It's from Malaysia.

38:27.088 --> 38:28.005
What?

38:29.463 --> 38:33.463
The sand here.
It's imported from Malaysia.

38:34.130 --> 38:37.630
Other reclaimed parts of Singapore
are from Indonesia and Vietnam.

38:39.296 --> 38:42.088
I heard that Cambodia supplies
our construction site.

38:42.796 --> 38:45.755
Some say it's bought off the black market.

38:47.671 --> 38:51.713
Doesn't that mean
we're no longer in Singapore?

38:53.546 --> 38:55.296
We're actually lying in Malaysia!

38:56.880 --> 39:00.463
In other words,
I don't need a boat or plane.

39:01.755 --> 39:03.046
All I need is this.

39:06.338 --> 39:07.838
You sure know a thing or two!

39:11.588 --> 39:15.046
Next time, I can take you
to other reclaimed areas

39:16.171 --> 39:17.588
to see the world!

39:29.380 --> 39:32.421
What are we going to do then?
Let's not cause trouble.

39:33.005 --> 39:34.838
-I knew it--
-Not so loud.

39:34.921 --> 39:36.130
This is bad.

39:36.255 --> 39:38.755
We can't sit here and do nothing.

39:38.838 --> 39:41.463
Let's ask Jason for a solution tomorrow.

39:42.671 --> 39:44.630
He can't be trusted.

39:45.713 --> 39:47.421
Only a fool will trust him.

39:47.838 --> 39:49.171
Watch what you say!

39:55.671 --> 39:58.171
AJIT: COME CANTEEN

40:02.588 --> 40:03.505
Hey.

40:04.296 --> 40:05.796
Is your hand okay?

40:06.838 --> 40:10.505
The boss said, "Hand okay, work okay."

40:12.630 --> 40:14.046
The boss will listen.

40:14.713 --> 40:16.880
You'll do the driving, okay?

40:24.255 --> 40:27.630
If you work today,
we'll not work together in the future.

40:28.921 --> 40:30.005
The boss will listen.

40:33.671 --> 40:34.546
You know...

40:36.463 --> 40:38.838
My mother got into an accident.

40:40.005 --> 40:41.630
The doctor cut off her leg.

40:42.588 --> 40:44.046
My wife is taking care of her.

40:47.338 --> 40:48.380
But she's alive.

40:50.213 --> 40:51.130
I'm happy.

40:52.255 --> 40:53.130
I am.

42:54.380 --> 42:56.338
DANGER
IN PROGRESS

43:12.713 --> 43:14.046
<i>Bomb has been planted.</i>

43:16.005 --> 43:17.588
How do you know I come here every night?

43:20.296 --> 43:21.755
You sure have a lot of free time.

43:28.296 --> 43:30.546
Hey. Are you using me as bait?

44:05.796 --> 44:06.880
Hey, Wang.

44:07.296 --> 44:08.255
You stay.

44:08.921 --> 44:12.713
I'll come back. Stay, okay?

44:24.005 --> 44:25.463
Which fish you like?

44:27.046 --> 44:29.213
Which fish? You like fish?

44:29.296 --> 44:30.630
Good fish.

44:32.713 --> 44:34.671
-Big one?
-Yes.

44:36.088 --> 44:37.296
The big one is not good.

44:55.755 --> 44:58.796
How much is the fish?

45:03.171 --> 45:05.630
-Some of them don't like my skin color.
-You...

45:06.880 --> 45:09.838
You need to go back.

45:10.088 --> 45:11.171
To see your mother.

45:13.130 --> 45:16.546
No. I owe the company money.

45:17.713 --> 45:19.380
The boss has taken my passport.

45:20.713 --> 45:22.046
They won't let me go back.

46:16.963 --> 46:18.921
I know where the passports are.

46:19.380 --> 46:20.713
I'll go take your passport.

46:21.713 --> 46:22.671
It's okay.

46:23.296 --> 46:24.671
Jason will help me.

46:25.755 --> 46:26.963
He will tell his uncle.

46:27.880 --> 46:28.963
I can go home.

46:29.296 --> 46:32.171
No. Jason is not good.

46:33.880 --> 46:35.296
Maybe you remember wrong.

46:36.421 --> 46:37.671
You do not know Jason.

46:43.421 --> 46:44.755
After the accident,

46:46.171 --> 46:47.588
you did not sleep.

46:52.046 --> 46:53.130
You're very tired.

46:56.713 --> 46:57.588
I...

47:05.338 --> 47:06.296
I don't know.

47:09.755 --> 47:10.588
Many...

47:15.546 --> 47:16.755
I don't remember

47:17.463 --> 47:18.630
a lot of things.

47:22.421 --> 47:24.171
I don't even remember...

47:25.921 --> 47:27.005
how it feels to dream.

47:33.213 --> 47:34.046
Ajit.

47:37.588 --> 47:39.796
Do you dream?

47:43.005 --> 47:43.921
Yes.

47:45.755 --> 47:46.755
I dream.

47:49.671 --> 47:51.380
Here, I dream all the time.

47:53.671 --> 47:54.880
<i>You are dancing.</i>

47:55.921 --> 47:56.963
<i>I am singing.</i>

47:59.546 --> 48:01.088
<i>But I'm not me.</i>

48:03.630 --> 48:04.796
<i>You're not you.</i>

48:19.921 --> 48:21.005
Jason is here.

48:22.796 --> 48:24.005
I'm going with him

48:25.130 --> 48:26.630
to take Hao to the airport now.

48:27.963 --> 48:29.005
Now?

48:29.880 --> 48:31.588
-Airport?
-Yes.

48:32.713 --> 48:34.088
He asked for help.

48:35.255 --> 48:38.921
Maybe Hao doesn't want to go.

48:41.296 --> 48:42.713
We'll talk tomorrow.

49:40.255 --> 49:41.171
Ajit?

49:46.546 --> 49:47.671
Where's Ajit?

50:10.755 --> 50:11.921
<i>It's been three days.</i>

50:15.130 --> 50:18.546
He hasn't answered my calls
or gone back to the dormitory.

50:22.213 --> 50:23.505
It's impossible.

50:24.755 --> 50:27.088
He owes the company
months of advance payment.

50:27.880 --> 50:30.796
Plus, they have our passports.

50:32.296 --> 50:33.380
What are you talking about?

50:39.713 --> 50:41.046
Look at you, making friends.

50:42.588 --> 50:45.213
Nothing but creeps here, be careful.

50:52.505 --> 50:53.463
Isn't it hot?

50:55.421 --> 50:56.380
It's too hot.

50:57.671 --> 50:58.880
Let's go for a ride.

50:59.880 --> 51:01.046
Get some fresh air.

51:03.338 --> 51:04.838
I don't have the truck anymore.

51:09.880 --> 51:12.380
Just today? Or from today on?

51:17.505 --> 51:18.338
Never mind.

51:44.005 --> 51:45.088
Is your arm okay?

51:46.005 --> 51:47.588
It's raining. Let's pack up.

51:48.296 --> 51:49.296
Where's Ajit?

51:50.213 --> 51:52.088
He has gone back
to see his mother in Bangladesh.

51:53.213 --> 51:54.130
Liar.

51:56.005 --> 51:57.880
Wang, don't do anything stupid.

51:59.130 --> 52:01.130
Uncle!

54:12.713 --> 54:14.755
FIRST AID STATION

55:16.338 --> 55:17.796
GIVEN NAME: AJIT

59:21.255 --> 59:25.213
CHINESE WORKER CAUSES TROUBLE
AT LAND RECLAMATION SITE

59:40.130 --> 59:42.213
Tell me! Where is he?

59:45.505 --> 59:47.296
You actually don't know anything.

59:49.463 --> 59:53.588
You only know how to hide
behind a computer to mess with me.

59:54.130 --> 59:55.505
Have you had your fun?

59:58.796 --> 59:59.796
Where are you hiding?

1:00:00.546 --> 1:00:01.921
Show yourself if you have the guts!

1:00:02.921 --> 1:00:04.130
Show yourself!

1:00:09.505 --> 1:00:10.713
What's all that shouting about?

1:00:16.255 --> 1:00:17.255
Who is he?

1:00:17.588 --> 1:00:19.505
-Who is that TROLL862?
-Who?

1:00:19.713 --> 1:00:22.588
-Who are you talking about?
-How do I find TROLL862?

1:00:25.505 --> 1:00:26.755
You got ditched?

1:00:28.338 --> 1:00:30.005
Online relationships are heartless.

1:00:30.588 --> 1:00:32.463
Good guys don't exist. Get used to it.

1:00:32.921 --> 1:00:34.838
I'm not used to it. Nor do I want to be!

1:00:34.921 --> 1:00:36.505
Hey, don't be like that.

1:00:37.713 --> 1:00:39.463
It's impossible to find him
even if I want to.

1:00:41.421 --> 1:00:42.380
Wang Bicheng.

1:00:49.213 --> 1:00:50.088
Look at me.

1:00:52.380 --> 1:00:53.921
When was the last time you slept?

1:00:57.005 --> 1:00:59.796
Like I told you, I can help you sleep.

1:01:00.630 --> 1:01:01.713
Do you trust me?

1:03:47.130 --> 1:03:48.171
Are you there?

1:04:02.338 --> 1:04:03.380
Even you have gone.

1:04:18.338 --> 1:04:19.463
Is there anybody out there?

1:04:20.046 --> 1:04:21.588
<i>All right, let's move out.</i>

1:04:29.755 --> 1:04:31.755
I haven't slept so well in a long time.

1:04:35.838 --> 1:04:39.255
<i>Fire, fire in the hole!</i>

1:04:41.880 --> 1:04:43.380
<i>I think I had a dream.</i>

1:04:48.296 --> 1:04:51.171
<i>I dreamed of my own death.</i>

1:04:56.005 --> 1:04:56.963
<i>Actually,</i>

1:04:59.338 --> 1:05:01.338
<i>it's not my first time having such dreams.</i>

1:05:06.921 --> 1:05:08.588
<i>I'm not a morbid person.</i>

1:05:11.046 --> 1:05:12.171
<i>It's just that</i>

1:05:14.921 --> 1:05:16.755
<i>sometimes my imagination acts up.</i>

1:05:23.255 --> 1:05:26.380
<i>The feeling I had wasn't painful</i>

1:05:29.505 --> 1:05:31.046
<i>or terrifying.</i>

1:05:34.755 --> 1:05:38.796
<i>It was like being swallowed by something.</i>

1:05:42.338 --> 1:05:44.088
<i>Slowly sinking downwards.</i>

1:05:48.630 --> 1:05:49.796
<i>It's hard to explain.</i>

1:05:52.255 --> 1:05:53.630
<i>It was as if</i>

1:05:56.588 --> 1:05:59.005
<i>I was being forgotten</i>
<i>by a kind of ignorance.</i>

1:06:03.963 --> 1:06:04.963
<i>At the end,</i>

1:06:08.046 --> 1:06:10.171
<i>I realized I had disappeared</i>
<i>in my own dream.</i>

1:06:17.880 --> 1:06:18.963
<i>I dreamed of</i>

1:06:21.838 --> 1:06:25.380
<i>two policemen investigating</i>
<i>my disappearance.</i>

1:06:28.630 --> 1:06:30.796
<i>One of them was an insomniac too.</i>

1:06:33.421 --> 1:06:34.505
<i>As for the other,</i>

1:06:35.838 --> 1:06:37.755
<i>it'd be game over for him soon.</i>

1:06:42.255 --> 1:06:47.255
<i>They didn't particularly care about me.</i>

1:06:49.421 --> 1:06:51.213
<i>They were just doing their job.</i>

1:06:54.963 --> 1:06:56.671
<i>In fact, they were quite good at it.</i>

1:07:00.338 --> 1:07:01.630
<i>Their investigation</i>

1:07:05.713 --> 1:07:07.588
<i>had led them here.</i>

1:07:19.921 --> 1:07:20.880
It's you again.

1:07:24.713 --> 1:07:25.630
Fuck.

1:07:31.088 --> 1:07:32.296
Have you seen him before?

1:07:32.755 --> 1:07:33.630
No.

1:07:35.088 --> 1:07:39.130
You want to look harder?
Or shall I look hard at your papers?

1:07:44.296 --> 1:07:45.380
Number 57.

1:07:52.838 --> 1:07:55.213
What did you talk about
the last time you saw him?

1:07:57.796 --> 1:07:59.296
He was looking for someone.

1:07:59.880 --> 1:08:02.921
Looking for someone? A co-worker?
It was an alias of an account.

1:08:07.255 --> 1:08:09.463
I think he was looking for a gamer here.

1:08:09.713 --> 1:08:10.671
What alias?

1:08:14.630 --> 1:08:18.755
Troll 8... 3...

1:08:18.921 --> 1:08:20.921
-Something.
-862.

1:08:29.671 --> 1:08:32.505
TROLL862: I HEARD DEATH IN DREAMS
SYMBOLIZES NEW BEGINNINGS.

1:08:32.588 --> 1:08:33.630
WBC31: ARE YOU STILL THERE?

1:08:39.296 --> 1:08:44.171
TROLL862: I AM STILL LISTENING, GO ON.

1:08:47.380 --> 1:08:48.421
WBC31: SHALL WE MEET?

1:08:53.588 --> 1:08:57.088
TROLL862: OKAY, OR MAYBE NOT, OFFICER.

1:08:57.755 --> 1:08:59.671
Is every computer here linked up?

1:09:00.380 --> 1:09:01.963
You can talk if you put that on.

1:09:09.838 --> 1:09:13.755
Since you know I'm the police,
I seek your cooperation.

1:09:14.796 --> 1:09:16.296
<i>You must be the sleepless one.</i>
<i>Wang Bicheng told me about you.</i>

1:09:22.713 --> 1:09:23.838
What else did he say?

1:09:25.421 --> 1:09:28.963
<i>He said death feels like being swallowed.</i>

1:09:30.671 --> 1:09:32.171
<i>Sinking downwards,</i>

1:09:33.255 --> 1:09:35.088
<i>as though being forgotten by ignorance.</i>

1:09:35.671 --> 1:09:37.630
-It's here.
-Hey.

1:09:40.671 --> 1:09:41.796
Where is he now?

1:09:43.671 --> 1:09:44.963
<i>He's been swallowed.</i>
<i>Oh, I almost forgot.</i>

1:09:48.171 --> 1:09:50.880
<i>He said it would be game over</i>
<i>for your partner soon.</i>

1:10:20.921 --> 1:10:23.213
Drop the gun!

1:12:04.546 --> 1:12:07.046
You know how important land reclamation is
to the people on top.

1:12:09.171 --> 1:12:13.296
You're being investigated.
Why did you go back to the site?

1:12:15.421 --> 1:12:18.255
So someone got himself ran over
while crossing the road.

1:12:18.588 --> 1:12:19.796
Why investigate me?

1:12:21.713 --> 1:12:23.130
Aren't you retiring soon?

1:12:24.046 --> 1:12:27.588
Just keep your head down for the next
few years. You'll get your pension soon.

CHINESE WORKER CAUSES TROUBLE
AT LAND RECLAMATION SITE

1:13:26.130 --> 1:13:27.921
<i>How is it fair that I don't get paid?</i>

1:13:29.755 --> 1:13:31.796
<i>I'm not coming down!</i>

1:13:32.713 --> 1:13:33.963
<i>I want my money!</i>

1:13:35.755 --> 1:13:37.505
<i>It's my hard-earned money!</i>

1:13:38.921 --> 1:13:40.463
<i>Get lost!</i>

1:13:41.921 --> 1:13:43.588
<i>I demand to get paid!</i>

1:14:12.130 --> 1:14:13.796
Officer, can I help you?

1:14:15.130 --> 1:14:16.296
I'm just looking around.

1:14:16.880 --> 1:14:19.338
My uncle isn't around.
He doesn't want to see you.

1:14:21.713 --> 1:14:24.421
I just want to know what on earth
you people do here.

1:14:27.880 --> 1:14:28.880
Let's take a walk.

1:15:38.463 --> 1:15:41.380
Didn't you want to know what we do here?

1:17:25.088 --> 1:17:27.046
How much longer will this go on for?

1:17:29.463 --> 1:17:33.880
We've never stopped reclaiming land.

1:17:34.505 --> 1:17:36.963
We'll reclaim for as long as we can.

1:17:38.755 --> 1:17:39.671
What do you think?

1:17:40.796 --> 1:17:44.588
What's the worth of a land that is capable
of being forged freely at our will?

1:17:45.546 --> 1:17:51.046
Officer, your question is too deep for me.

1:17:51.463 --> 1:17:52.963
I hear you, but I'm not sure I get you.

1:18:12.296 --> 1:18:13.505
Ajit.

1:18:21.546 --> 1:18:22.380
Ajit.

1:18:23.213 --> 1:18:24.130
Hello, sir.

1:18:25.463 --> 1:18:29.588
Mr. Lok is a policeman.
He wants to know if we treat you badly.

1:18:32.171 --> 1:18:35.213
Go on, it's okay. Tell the officer.

1:18:35.588 --> 1:18:38.713
If you have anything to complain,
if you don't like working for us,

1:18:39.130 --> 1:18:40.338
just say it to him now.

1:18:43.546 --> 1:18:45.380
I am happy

1:18:46.255 --> 1:18:48.463
working for this company.

1:18:50.380 --> 1:18:51.338
Are you sure?

1:18:55.630 --> 1:18:56.838
Mr. Jason

1:18:57.588 --> 1:19:01.630
and the foreman take very good care of me.

1:19:02.380 --> 1:19:03.630
Do we pay you okay?

1:19:07.046 --> 1:19:07.880
Yes.

1:19:08.713 --> 1:19:09.838
The company

1:19:11.713 --> 1:19:13.088
pays more

1:19:14.213 --> 1:19:15.463
than my friends

1:19:16.671 --> 1:19:20.380
who work in Malaysia, Indonesia,

1:19:21.963 --> 1:19:22.880
Hong Kong,
Korea.

1:19:27.463 --> 1:19:28.588
Many times more

1:19:29.255 --> 1:19:33.505
than if I work in Bangladesh.

1:19:37.213 --> 1:19:40.755
Do you have anything at all you want to
complain about your working conditions?

1:20:06.171 --> 1:20:07.505
What happened to Wang?

1:24:00.005 --> 1:24:02.755
VIDEO CALL FROM WBC31

1:24:11.130 --> 1:24:12.338
Wang Bicheng?

1:24:48.088 --> 1:24:50.338
Is that why he always chose
to sit at this computer?

1:24:51.671 --> 1:24:55.546
<i>It's the seat with the best view,</i>
<i>don't you think?</i>

1:24:57.296 --> 1:24:58.713
So she's his type?

1:24:59.921 --> 1:25:04.796
<i>I think he wasn't picky.</i>
<i>That's what happens when you're lonely.</i>

1:25:06.755 --> 1:25:08.213
Aren't you lonely too?

1:25:13.505 --> 1:25:14.713
<i>Fucking crap!</i>

1:25:15.130 --> 1:25:18.046
<i>-I didn't pay for this garbage! Fuck!</i>
-Fucking hell.

1:25:18.130 --> 1:25:19.546
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1:25:19.630 --> 1:25:21.171
<i>-Crap! I'm breaking your shit!</i>
-Fuck!

1:25:21.255 --> 1:25:23.171
<i>-What's your problem?</i>
<i>-I'll break all these.</i>

1:25:23.255 --> 1:25:25.588
<i>I have a lot of money.</i>
<i>I can buy the whole shop!</i>

1:25:25.921 --> 1:25:26.921
<i>What are you staring at?</i>

1:25:27.005 --> 1:25:30.463
<i>I'll pay you to suck me off,</i>
<i>that should shut you up.</i>

1:25:31.046 --> 1:25:35.421
<i>A fucking shop attendant</i>
<i>telling me what to do?</i>

1:25:35.880 --> 1:25:38.005
<i>I'm the filthy rich one here!</i>
<i>Motherfucker. </i>

1:25:43.546 --> 1:25:44.630
Motherfucker.

1:25:57.838 --> 1:25:59.421
Hey, what are you doing?

1:26:09.796 --> 1:26:11.421
Wait for me, darling.

1:26:12.338 --> 1:26:13.338
Get lost!

1:26:43.338 --> 1:26:44.796
He came to see you every night?

1:26:50.130 --> 1:26:53.796
I kind of miss those creepy eyes
leering at me.

1:26:59.088 --> 1:27:01.796
He would take me out in his truck.

1:27:02.546 --> 1:27:03.755
Where to?

1:27:06.880 --> 1:27:08.213
Depends on the mood.

1:27:08.546 --> 1:27:11.005
Sometimes we would go to Malaysia.

1:27:11.088 --> 1:27:16.505
Other times, Indonesia, Vietnam,
and Cambodia too.

1:27:19.171 --> 1:27:20.921
Do you know where he is now?

1:27:31.171 --> 1:27:32.255
Do you have a car?
