01:10.278 --> 01:13.362
How we choose to move through life

01:13.490 --> 01:16.574
is maybe as important as where we go.

01:16.701 --> 01:22.122
Whoever first said it's the journey,
not the destination, never took the bus.

01:22.248 --> 01:26.994
One meaning of the word "commute"
is "to shorten a prison sentence".

01:27.128 --> 01:29.915
Commuting is a prison sentence.

01:30.048 --> 01:33.132
Freedoms are being
systematically stripped away:

01:33.259 --> 01:37.209
your freedom of space,
freedom of information,

01:37.347 --> 01:39.754
freedom of smell.

01:39.891 --> 01:43.509
It would be enough to kill me
if I weren't already dead.

01:43.645 --> 01:45.970
I know what I'm talking about.

01:46.106 --> 01:50.020
Who does he think he is,
trying to talk to me like that?

02:00.745 --> 02:04.494
- "Where the heart is in Honduras. Four."
- Casa.

02:06.209 --> 02:10.372
- Nice work, peanut.
- Are you wearing a fragrance this morning?

02:10.505 --> 02:13.376
It's orange juice. I hate the bus.

02:13.508 --> 02:18.217
- Public transportation is the great equaliser.
- Fuck equal.

02:18.346 --> 02:20.920
- Steal a car.
- What about a bicycle?

02:21.057 --> 02:24.307
I once had Dorothy's bike
from The Wizard Of Oz.

02:25.395 --> 02:29.179
- I knew someone from the props department.
- You mean you blew somebody?

02:29.315 --> 02:31.807
Knew, blew, "tomayto, tomahto".

02:31.943 --> 02:36.938
Once Judy died, I didn't want it
any more so I sold it at an auction.

02:37.073 --> 02:40.359
Speaking of death, let's get to work.

02:41.202 --> 02:45.200
- Gwen Isle. That's, like, a three-hour drive.
- Plus the ferry.

02:45.999 --> 02:49.284
What...? Hang on, two souls.
Where the fuck is Roxy?

02:49.419 --> 02:53.582
She's needed elsewhere.
Just worry about yourself, huh?

02:53.715 --> 02:58.756
- Three-hour drive and a fucking ferry!
- You got two Post-its, but one address.

02:58.887 --> 03:03.596
Oh. Well, what does that mean?
Murder, suicide, double murder, what?

03:03.725 --> 03:05.967
Three hours apart. That's all I got.

03:06.102 --> 03:08.474
- Gwen Isle's beautiful.
- So let's swap.

03:08.605 --> 03:10.644
- No trading.
- No trading.

03:10.774 --> 03:13.561
- Right, that's it.
- What about mine?

03:13.693 --> 03:16.445
- Yeah.
- I don't have a Post-it for you yet.

03:16.571 --> 03:20.022
You're way too concerned
with other people's schedules.

03:20.158 --> 03:24.571
- Bike's a good idea.
- I had a bike. Red. And cool.

03:24.704 --> 03:27.705
Mom, I can do this. Hands off!

03:27.832 --> 03:30.619
I'm doing it. I'm doing it!

03:30.752 --> 03:33.788
And I'm never coming back!

03:33.922 --> 03:36.923
Now it belongs to my little sister.

03:38.009 --> 03:41.461
Could you pick up
some Tater Tots tonight for dinner?

03:41.596 --> 03:46.507
- Will we see you tonight for dinner?
- I'll let you know as soon as I know.

03:46.643 --> 03:49.430
JD, want some toast?

03:49.562 --> 03:53.690
He doesn't want any toast, Reggie.
He wants bacon.

03:54.651 --> 03:59.479
I don't know how great an idea it is
to feed the dog at the table.

03:59.614 --> 04:02.781
He... needs his own snacks.
Don't you, buddy?

04:02.909 --> 04:06.989
Hey, buddy! How would you like
a doggy door? I bought you one.

04:07.122 --> 04:11.618
Would you like to come in and go out
as you please? Smoochie.

04:11.751 --> 04:15.831
- Smoochie. Dad, don't be such a tool.
- Reggie!

04:23.179 --> 04:28.422
- Huh.
- It's more than I make in two months.

04:28.560 --> 04:31.976
Well, part-time, entry level.
What are you gonna do?

04:32.105 --> 04:35.640
If I were someone else?
Introduce myself.

04:37.235 --> 04:40.853
- You been checking the job postings?
- No.

04:40.989 --> 04:45.567
Oh, I guess you're heading towards
full-time Happy Time.

04:45.702 --> 04:47.908
No.

04:53.752 --> 05:00.253
I was gonna say I saw a new posting
for a great gig that pays really well.

05:00.383 --> 05:04.713
- Get you that bike in a few weeks.
- Why wouldn't you take the job?

05:04.846 --> 05:10.682
I just got here, so... They're looking for
someone with slightly more seniority.

05:10.810 --> 05:13.764
Someone slightly cuter, I guess.

05:20.278 --> 05:26.151
Wait a minute. Can you show me
the webpage with the posting?

05:26.993 --> 05:30.030
Sure. I'm Josh.

05:33.583 --> 05:37.830
I don't understand, Millie.
You've already contacted the employer?

05:37.962 --> 05:40.999
I didn't. Um, Josh called him.

05:41.132 --> 05:45.759
Who is Josh? Never mind.
What did the employer say?

05:45.887 --> 05:48.508
- Yes.
- Yes what?

05:49.724 --> 05:52.761
He said yes, I'm hired.

05:54.354 --> 05:57.271
I didn't do anything. Josh did everything.

05:57.399 --> 06:00.483
Does Josh know
you're a valued employee?

06:01.277 --> 06:04.278
That's very nice of you, Delores,

06:04.406 --> 06:12.152
but I thought I'd just look for something
more... living wage-ish. I wanna buy a bike.

06:12.288 --> 06:16.749
I wanna ride in the Kentucky Derby
but you don't see me in racing silks.

06:16.876 --> 06:21.040
- Well, when do they want you to begin?
- Tomorrow.

06:21.172 --> 06:23.461
Tomorrow?

06:24.634 --> 06:28.548
Interesting. Well, GFY.

06:30.181 --> 06:35.342
Good for you. Looks like I've got
a going-away party to organise.

06:35.478 --> 06:37.554
Excuse me.

06:38.356 --> 06:41.725
GFM. Good for me.

06:41.860 --> 06:47.198
He may be the one who bought this door,
but I'm the one who's putting it in.

06:48.533 --> 06:52.780
I'm betting you're smart enough
to figure that out, JD. Am I right?

06:55.165 --> 06:58.000
Well, don't say I never give you anything.

06:59.085 --> 07:01.576
Hey! It works.

07:03.715 --> 07:06.336
JD? JD?

07:07.677 --> 07:08.922
JD!

07:14.893 --> 07:17.562
Fuck me!

07:23.860 --> 07:28.189
Hello? C Friedman?

07:28.323 --> 07:32.023
- It's Chris.
- Well, good morning, Chris.

07:32.160 --> 07:36.074
- How did you get in here?
- Took the stairs, silly.

07:36.206 --> 07:38.957
- And you are...?
- I'm Daisy.

07:39.084 --> 07:40.910
Daisy Adair.

07:42.712 --> 07:46.792
- I'm a patron of the arts.
- Oh. That's too bad.

07:46.925 --> 07:50.258
Now, how on earth
could meeting me be bad?

07:50.387 --> 07:53.553
Because people
who call themselves patrons

07:53.682 --> 07:56.848
generally want to talk about
what a painting is worth,

07:56.976 --> 07:59.598
rather than what they see and feel.

07:59.729 --> 08:05.518
Wouldn't one consider both: art and value?
Sounds reasonable enough.

08:05.652 --> 08:08.487
Nothing about painting is reasonable.

08:15.078 --> 08:17.616
- How much?
- How much?

08:17.747 --> 08:20.534
As in, how much did I wanna paint that?

08:20.667 --> 08:25.293
How much pain was I in doing it?
How much joy when it was done?

08:25.422 --> 08:28.588
- Is that what you mean?
- Yeah.

08:28.717 --> 08:31.753
- How much?
- It's not for sale.

08:31.886 --> 08:36.679
- Doesn't your gallery set a price?
- I don't have a gallery.

08:36.808 --> 08:40.722
That's ridiculous.
Your work is... It's pretty good.

08:40.854 --> 08:44.187
- I mean, it could sell.
- That's not why I do it.

08:45.191 --> 08:51.194
Besides, the gruesome truth is nothing
really sells until after the artist... kicks it.

08:51.322 --> 08:52.698
Hah.

08:52.824 --> 08:57.237
I don't mean to be rude,
but I need to get back to work.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.493
I'm sorry I can't sell you anything.

08:59.622 --> 09:03.038
These things
have a way of sorting themselves out.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.663
I like that painting.

09:43.458 --> 09:46.494
Suddenly this was it. Moving day.

09:46.628 --> 09:49.498
And everyone seemed to know.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.167
Cake requests?

09:54.302 --> 09:56.924
Yes. Let there be no cake.

09:57.055 --> 10:01.516
If you can make a giant sandwich,
why can't you make a giant quesadilla?

10:01.643 --> 10:04.312
Give me some prices on renting a burro.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.513
Pass out the party memos.

10:06.648 --> 10:08.854
Talk to her and get back to me pronto.

10:09.025 --> 10:13.817
Tell him it's Delores and I will eat his balls
for breakfast if he disappoints me.

10:13.947 --> 10:17.779
Pick up the cake
and I will reimburse you from petty cash.

10:17.909 --> 10:22.286
Here's the key to the store room.
PiÃ±ata on the third shelf.

10:23.957 --> 10:28.666
- I don't want a party.
- You're going away. That merits a party.

10:28.795 --> 10:31.749
It's just really... unnecessary.

10:31.881 --> 10:36.424
You're a member of the Happy Time family.
Happy Time has been your home.

10:36.553 --> 10:42.140
- I don't know if I'd actually call it home.
- Obviously you don't.

10:42.267 --> 10:46.134
Not any more. And we'll all miss you.

10:52.652 --> 10:56.235
I hadn't been able
to call Happy Time home

10:56.364 --> 11:00.065
but other people
didn't seem to have that problem.

11:00.201 --> 11:05.622
I guess making work like home
made work feel a little less like work.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.785
Hi.

11:11.296 --> 11:13.454
Hi.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.671
This is for your stuff.

11:25.810 --> 11:29.938
- Thanks.
- We're really gonna miss you.

11:31.066 --> 11:32.476
Thanks.

11:34.319 --> 11:36.276
I'm Stephanie.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.274
Millie.

11:42.911 --> 11:45.912
I am not imagining this.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.286
- We've been here already.
- I'm aware of that!

11:52.420 --> 11:56.465
Circle round again in case
he decides to come home on his own.

11:56.591 --> 12:00.803
- How did he get out?
- Hole in the fence in the back yard.

12:00.929 --> 12:04.179
- So fucking stupid!
- Mom. Mom.

12:04.307 --> 12:05.338
What?

12:06.768 --> 12:09.057
It's not your fault.

12:11.356 --> 12:12.898
JD!

12:17.362 --> 12:20.612
- Hi.
- I'm looking for a C Bond.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.649
I'm Cary Bond.

12:22.784 --> 12:25.987
Would this household
like to participate in a survey?

12:26.121 --> 12:30.332
- Let me check. Henry?
- Honey?

12:30.458 --> 12:33.661
Would this household
like to participate in a survey?

12:33.795 --> 12:36.666
- Is he cute?
- Well, it's not bad.

12:36.798 --> 12:39.289
- Is he clean?
- It's English.

12:39.426 --> 12:42.629
Oh, well ask him if he wants a cosmo.

12:42.762 --> 12:46.807
- God save the Queen.
- Not today, sir.

12:48.935 --> 12:51.011
OK, here it comes.

12:51.146 --> 12:54.645
Everyone sneaks away
and you pretend you don't notice

12:54.774 --> 12:58.309
and then they call you
with a cheesy excuse.

12:59.738 --> 13:04.031
Millie, can you come to reception
to sign for a package, please?

13:04.159 --> 13:07.777
It's exactly how they did it
for Indira's birthday.

13:07.912 --> 13:10.285
Surprise!

13:14.419 --> 13:16.495
# For she's a jolly good fellow

13:16.629 --> 13:19.963
# For she's a jolly good fellow
For she's a jolly good fellow...

13:20.091 --> 13:25.049
The song will end... eventually.
Just keep smiling.

13:25.180 --> 13:28.181
# Which nobody can deny #

13:28.308 --> 13:30.431
Blow.

13:33.605 --> 13:37.899
- I think I'm gonna miss you the most.
- Anybody seen the burro?

13:38.026 --> 13:43.269
Excuse me. Excuse me!
What the hell's going on here?

13:43.406 --> 13:47.024
You're done here, handsome.
Now skedaddle, go, shoo.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.406
Oh...

13:53.166 --> 13:56.084
I have a straggler.

13:59.089 --> 14:03.466
What do you two
describe your television viewing habits as?

14:03.593 --> 14:08.006
I'll take that one! Mostly we're in the bedroom,
sometimes on the sofa.

14:08.139 --> 14:11.306
We had such a fight
over putting a TV in the bedroom.

14:11.434 --> 14:15.349
He is talking about what we watch.
Jesus, it's embarrassing.

14:15.480 --> 14:20.023
- Oh. Sorry.
- What do you two watch, then?

14:20.151 --> 14:23.603
- Trading Spaces, Sports Center...
- Peter Jennings.

14:23.738 --> 14:26.858
He's probably out of your league
and not in your team.

14:26.991 --> 14:32.152
In my time, I bet I could have convinced him.
What do you think, Harry?

14:32.288 --> 14:36.500
I think fewer onions in there
or you're gonna screw it up.

14:39.838 --> 14:42.625
- Which one of you is the woman?
- What?

14:42.757 --> 14:47.466
Jesus. We're lifelong companions.
We're two gay men.

14:47.595 --> 14:51.759
- One of us for longer than the other.
- I screwed one woman when I was 19.

14:51.891 --> 14:55.307
And I haven't heard the end of it
for 30 years.

14:55.437 --> 14:58.888
How did you like that, fucking a woman?

14:59.024 --> 15:02.973
About as much as
she liked fucking me, I suppose.

15:03.111 --> 15:05.269
Good answer.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.481
Mm. Nice.

15:08.450 --> 15:12.910
So, is this survey over? Are we finished?

15:14.748 --> 15:16.906
Yeah, just about.

15:17.042 --> 15:19.912
No, no. No.

15:25.550 --> 15:27.590
- What's the problem?
- He's over there.

15:27.719 --> 15:32.926
- I see him. What's the problem?
- I think he's got a crush on me.

15:36.728 --> 15:39.848
- C Friedman, I take it?
- Chris.

15:39.981 --> 15:42.686
Listen, I understand she's an appealing girl.

15:42.817 --> 15:46.767
Not my type.
Nonetheless, you're supposed to move on.

15:46.905 --> 15:49.906
She took my painting.

15:50.992 --> 15:53.779
It's good.

15:53.912 --> 15:57.032
Is it the house you grew up in?

15:58.333 --> 16:00.740
Kind of a self-portrait, huh?

16:03.088 --> 16:05.246
I don't want her to have it.

16:06.299 --> 16:10.344
Chris... Now, forgive my boldness...

16:12.597 --> 16:14.969
You're not gonna need the painting.

16:15.100 --> 16:19.311
It needs to hang in a place
with the right light. She's gonna sell it.

16:19.437 --> 16:21.809
I can't compel her.

16:21.940 --> 16:27.396
Well, I'm not moving on. I'm not going anywhere,
not until she gives it back.

16:34.869 --> 16:39.199
I can't be responsible
for every soul who wants a piece of me.

16:39.332 --> 16:42.417
What d'you think you're doing?
You think it's a game?

16:42.544 --> 16:45.995
That every life you stroll through
is a grab-bag for you?

16:46.131 --> 16:49.963
- I hardly think...
- Yes, and that's the problem.

16:50.093 --> 16:53.925
We have work to do.
You, you're an acquisitive one.

16:54.055 --> 16:59.809
When your acquisitiveness interferes with
my schedule, things start to come undone.

16:59.936 --> 17:03.103
It's not my fault he has feelings for me.

17:03.231 --> 17:06.481
Princess, he's got feelings,
but they're not for you.

17:06.608 --> 17:09.146
I've had enough of this shit.

17:09.279 --> 17:13.323
- Rube, what are you gonna do about him?
- Your straggler, your problem.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.906
Eugh!

17:24.586 --> 17:25.830
JD?

17:32.093 --> 17:35.213
- What you doing, Reg?
- Drawing.

17:35.347 --> 17:38.680
- Is that a picture of JD?
- Yes.

17:38.808 --> 17:43.969
That looks great!
Let's put it up on the wall right now.

17:44.105 --> 17:46.181
It's not done.

17:57.369 --> 18:00.868
- Delicious. What do you call that?
- Beef stew.

18:00.997 --> 18:03.488
Except there's no beef in it.

18:03.625 --> 18:08.370
- Because of Henry's cholesterol. 245.
- It's borderline high.

18:08.505 --> 18:12.039
- It's a heart attack waiting to happen.
- Probably not.

18:15.804 --> 18:18.092
Why is it that queers...

18:20.266 --> 18:24.810
.. you, er, homosexual people
have always got nice things?

18:24.938 --> 18:29.066
I, uh... I believe it's called "taste".

18:29.192 --> 18:31.268
Henry and I like to travel.

18:31.403 --> 18:35.400
- The Orient, mostly.
- We've fallen in love with Japan.

18:35.532 --> 18:39.031
Yes, I wish I had
a beautiful Japanese garden here.

18:39.160 --> 18:43.656
We like gardens. Don't say anything
stupid about gay men and gardening.

18:43.790 --> 18:49.330
A Japanese garden would be nice
but this is our home. We have what we have.

18:49.462 --> 18:52.297
You two have a beautiful home together.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.838
Yes, we do.

18:56.970 --> 19:00.006
- Thank you for my meal.
- You're welcome.

19:00.140 --> 19:02.013
I have to brush my teeth.

19:02.142 --> 19:06.389
His cholesterol level is 245,
he eats chocolate croissants for breakfast

19:06.521 --> 19:09.807
and all he gives a shit about
is tartar build-up.

19:09.941 --> 19:12.895
And that is not very nice.

19:15.739 --> 19:19.024
Henry can be a little sensitive sometimes.

19:19.159 --> 19:21.400
Yeah, we all can.

19:46.353 --> 19:49.140
Cary, time to put the tea on.

19:57.739 --> 19:59.862
JD?

19:59.991 --> 20:05.116
- This is a lost cause.
- Well, maybe we should split up.

20:05.246 --> 20:07.998
Oh, that's great. That's great.

20:09.793 --> 20:13.625
You go, but you better
find yourself one hell of a lawyer.

20:15.507 --> 20:18.128
Split up to find the dog.

20:20.136 --> 20:22.508
Oh.

20:25.183 --> 20:28.184
That's a good idea.

20:46.996 --> 20:48.906
Oh, no. Thank you.

20:49.040 --> 20:52.125
It's just a little tab you put on your tongue.

20:52.252 --> 20:56.629
You know, I feel
my current reality is altered enough.

20:58.049 --> 21:01.003
- I did one.
- GFY.

21:04.764 --> 21:08.548
- Let's look out for each other today, OK?
- OK.

21:12.188 --> 21:17.183
I was starting to get the feeling
from Delores that, emotionally at least,

21:17.318 --> 21:21.150
there were easier ways
for me to get a new bike.

21:35.462 --> 21:40.088
I know you don't like it, but I'm gonna
hang onto the painting for a few months,

21:40.216 --> 21:43.052
find a buyer and collect a bundle.

21:43.178 --> 21:46.344
That's exactly what I'm saying.
You don't care about art.

21:46.473 --> 21:50.340
Do you know what it means
to care about art?

21:50.477 --> 21:53.596
Pardon me, I am an actress!

21:59.611 --> 22:05.447
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

22:17.462 --> 22:19.704
Oh, that's not right.

22:26.971 --> 22:31.265
- He just slipped on... on the floor?
- Yeah.

22:32.602 --> 22:36.766
You can...
You can see where he skidded there.

22:36.898 --> 22:39.187
This is as dangerous as a bathroom.

22:39.317 --> 22:43.185
- A lot of people... die in the kitchen.
- Die?

22:45.073 --> 22:47.742
Are you sure he's dead?

22:47.867 --> 22:50.441
- Can you feel a pulse?
- Um...

22:53.540 --> 22:57.489
- Then he's dead, yeah?
- What do I do?

22:57.627 --> 23:00.118
You can call the police or fire brigade.

23:00.255 --> 23:03.955
Phone the hospital
if you don't believe me he's dead.

23:04.092 --> 23:10.047
I mean... what do I do?
I mean, what am I supposed to do?

23:10.181 --> 23:13.681
Tell him not to do anything.

23:16.479 --> 23:19.231
I know what this man is gonna do.

23:19.357 --> 23:22.275
You have him call our friend Linda.

23:22.402 --> 23:25.319
This man cannot be left alone.

23:28.700 --> 23:32.532
Thank you, Mason. You can go now.

23:32.662 --> 23:35.912
Actually, I can't leave. Not just yet.

23:37.417 --> 23:39.623
Who are you?

23:39.753 --> 23:43.453
Because you're not here
about any survey, are you?

23:43.590 --> 23:45.962
No.

23:47.677 --> 23:52.304
I'm not here to hurt you
and I didn't... I didn't hurt your friend.

23:52.432 --> 23:54.970
I promise he slipped. It was an accident.

23:55.101 --> 23:58.517
There's no reason to be afraid.
I won't harm you.

23:58.646 --> 24:01.184
Who the fuck are you?

24:16.122 --> 24:20.167
- You must have been really important here.
- Uh, no.

24:20.293 --> 24:23.460
- Come on. Look at all this.
- The work of Delores.

24:23.588 --> 24:26.874
She must really care for you
to send you off like this.

24:27.008 --> 24:30.093
Please. Delores cares about Happy Ti...

24:31.388 --> 24:35.717
- Have you seen the burro?
- I think he's...

24:35.850 --> 24:38.472
I was talking to Josh.

24:39.479 --> 24:43.180
- I haven't seen the burro.
- Thanks.

24:44.109 --> 24:46.564
She hates me.

24:46.695 --> 24:49.232
Actually, I think it's just the opposite.

24:49.364 --> 24:51.771
Hey, where is the burro?

24:51.908 --> 24:55.324
I was in Banana Republic
rearranging men's jeans.

24:55.453 --> 24:58.573
Some fuckwit organised them
according to in-seam.

24:58.707 --> 25:02.407
This gentleman asks me for help.
He thought I worked there!

25:02.544 --> 25:05.545
Anyway, his name's Tito and he's a sailor.

25:05.672 --> 25:10.548
He served in the Gulf... of Mexico.
Coastguard off Biloxi.

25:10.677 --> 25:13.132
Are you worried he has a gal in every port?

25:13.263 --> 25:17.592
- Or that he's one of the Jackson Five?
- I don't get what you mean.

25:17.726 --> 25:20.976
Delores, I was wondering if you and I...

25:21.604 --> 25:25.104
I mean, you seem a little upset.

25:25.233 --> 25:28.400
I think Stephanie is missing.

25:28.528 --> 25:31.529
Who's looking out for Stephanie?

25:33.241 --> 25:37.073
Someone agreed
to look out for Stephanie tonight.

25:37.203 --> 25:39.611
That would be me.

25:43.543 --> 25:45.999
Here, buddy! JD!

25:52.260 --> 25:53.719
JD?

25:56.473 --> 25:58.346
JD?

25:59.392 --> 26:01.515
Goddamn dog.

26:06.524 --> 26:11.945
It turns out that certain remarks,
like, "Let's look out for each other",

26:12.072 --> 26:16.116
had a special significance
here at Happy Time.

26:16.242 --> 26:18.864
I can't find it, I can't find it.

26:18.995 --> 26:20.573
Stephanie?

26:21.748 --> 26:23.705
I can't... I can't find it.

26:23.833 --> 26:28.828
- You can't find what?
- Blue. Red's taken it over.

26:29.673 --> 26:33.373
- Red got blue?
- Red's been attacking all the colours.

26:33.510 --> 26:36.048
- We've gotta stop it.
- We do?

26:36.179 --> 26:41.339
Yellow's next. It doesn't stand a chance.
Poor yellow.

26:42.519 --> 26:46.468
- Why don't we go for a walk?
- No. No walk.

26:49.192 --> 26:51.979
I'm gonna call the colour police.

26:53.446 --> 26:57.610
Hello. I'd like to report
a colour crime in progress.

27:00.036 --> 27:02.788
I'm on hold.

27:08.003 --> 27:11.703
- Did you check the alley behind Octavia?
- No, I didn't.

27:12.882 --> 27:15.883
- I'll go check over there.
- You do that.

27:24.102 --> 27:27.850
- You cannot let him do this.
- It's not my job.

27:28.523 --> 27:31.643
You cannot let him go through with this.

27:32.569 --> 27:35.772
The truth is, what I cannot do is stop him.

27:36.865 --> 27:38.941
Oh, my God.

27:39.075 --> 27:42.990
I told him that was
always my favourite suit of his.

27:43.121 --> 27:45.160
You have to stop him.

27:45.290 --> 27:47.532
No! Please, stop him!

27:48.710 --> 27:51.830
- Henry.
- What?

27:51.963 --> 27:56.091
The business with the knife,
you might want to rethink that.

27:56.217 --> 27:58.839
Why would I rethink this?

27:58.970 --> 28:04.344
30 years with that beautiful man.
I am not getting into bed tonight without him.

28:04.476 --> 28:08.094
And I am not waking up tomorrow
without him.

28:08.229 --> 28:11.065
I won't. I can't.

28:13.026 --> 28:18.151
We were gonna go to Kyoto in the fall.
They have beautiful gardens there.

28:18.281 --> 28:20.653
And I won't go without Cary.

28:22.535 --> 28:27.447
Tell him to take the pills
in my medicine cabinet.

28:27.582 --> 28:30.120
The ones on the right.

28:33.630 --> 28:35.706
Henry...

28:38.134 --> 28:42.179
Have you thought about
taking pills instead?

28:43.390 --> 28:47.257
Because I know it's a lot less...

28:47.394 --> 28:53.562
.. messy. And a bit more...
kind of peaceful.

28:54.859 --> 28:57.564
And that is a really lovely suit.

28:57.696 --> 29:00.732
- It was Cary's favourite.
- Yeah.

29:02.158 --> 29:06.619
- Pills?
- The ones on the right.

29:06.746 --> 29:09.866
The ones on the right-hand side.

29:37.610 --> 29:39.437
Thank you.

29:40.530 --> 29:43.021
Enjoy the watch.

29:44.784 --> 29:48.284
- I...
- No, no. No.

29:48.413 --> 29:50.619
We want you to have it.

29:51.458 --> 29:56.167
Now, can we get me off the floor?
Do you mind?

30:03.261 --> 30:05.088
Good luck, Millie.

30:05.221 --> 30:07.380
Take care, Millie.

30:07.515 --> 30:11.762
You still do good work
even though you're away.

30:11.895 --> 30:13.971
Thank you.

30:27.410 --> 30:31.490
I thought you and George
could use a bit more space.

30:31.623 --> 30:35.206
- Nice watch.
- Thank you. It was a gift.

30:35.335 --> 30:38.252
- Are you gay?
- No.

30:46.262 --> 30:48.338
That's very sweet.

30:49.474 --> 30:56.271
Millie, when one of the Happy Time
family members decides to up and leave,

30:56.398 --> 30:59.683
well, we all... pitch in.

31:03.321 --> 31:05.812
Oh, you shouldn't have.

31:22.799 --> 31:26.963
It's a bicycle bell.
Josh seemed to think it was appropriate.

31:27.095 --> 31:29.467
Speech! Speech!

31:29.597 --> 31:34.972
- No, no. But... thank you.
- Well, then I'll make one.

31:36.521 --> 31:40.435
Millie has been with us
long enough to make her mark.

31:40.567 --> 31:45.478
And though Happy Time will no longer
be her office home...

31:46.281 --> 31:49.650
.. we'll think of her fondly and wish her...

32:12.182 --> 32:14.258
So this is your new house.

32:14.392 --> 32:20.312
Yes. And I've had a very long day
and I really need to get my beauty sleep.

32:20.440 --> 32:23.227
What are you doing with that?

32:24.778 --> 32:28.147
You have no idea
how to hang a painting, do you?

32:28.281 --> 32:30.819
You don't know where the light is.

32:30.950 --> 32:35.328
Daisy, do you know
how long I worked on that painting?

32:36.414 --> 32:39.499
Two years. The day I finished it I cried

32:39.626 --> 32:43.540
because I realised I'd finally
made something outside of myself.

32:43.672 --> 32:46.672
You wouldn't know about that, would you?

32:46.800 --> 32:51.592
This is the best room.
That window faces south.

32:51.721 --> 32:57.641
It catches the light. If you don't mind
my saying, you could use more light.

32:57.769 --> 33:00.853
That's crazy. I'm as light as a feather.

33:00.980 --> 33:06.188
Light as a feather.
No. There's more.

33:06.319 --> 33:09.771
But you have to try harder.

33:28.091 --> 33:31.127
Wait. Where are you going?

33:32.178 --> 33:35.179
I thought you didn't want me to have it.

33:36.808 --> 33:38.635
I just figured it out.

33:41.146 --> 33:43.269
I painted it for you.

34:07.464 --> 34:09.670
I was exhausted.

34:09.799 --> 34:13.085
But for some reason
I couldn't go straight home.

34:13.219 --> 34:15.627
Maybe I couldn't handle Daisy.

34:15.764 --> 34:20.757
Maybe it was because the Wafflehaus
felt more like home than any other.

34:20.893 --> 34:22.969
Coffee, hon?

34:23.103 --> 34:25.393
- What time is it?
- 6.45.

34:25.523 --> 34:28.145
- Morning?
- Yeah. Morning.

34:29.319 --> 34:31.476
I gotta go.

34:34.532 --> 34:39.408
It was the first day
of the rest of my life. Sort of.

34:40.246 --> 34:45.407
I guess I was moving on.
Another step, a new experience.

34:59.891 --> 35:02.133
Hi.

35:02.268 --> 35:05.388
I'm Millie, the new hire.

35:10.110 --> 35:12.186
Oh.

35:28.169 --> 35:30.660
I'd be happy to read them.

35:30.797 --> 35:34.083
Maybe we could talk about
what my job entails?

35:40.473 --> 35:44.092
So this was my new home.

35:44.227 --> 35:48.272
Well, nice and quiet. No one to bug me.

35:48.398 --> 35:52.859
And I can see he shares
my opinion of office stuff.

36:06.791 --> 36:10.041
I-E.

36:14.758 --> 36:17.046
So this was my new experience.

36:17.177 --> 36:22.681
I think there's a quality-of-life issue here.
Or maybe an absence-of-life issue.

36:22.807 --> 36:28.146
Either way, this doesn't feel like...
I don't know, home.

36:28.271 --> 36:30.596
Jesus!

36:53.880 --> 36:56.798
Lunch break from the day job, peanut?

36:58.385 --> 37:00.958
There is no job.

37:02.681 --> 37:07.141
No job. No money. No bike.

37:07.268 --> 37:10.472
Try something new, get fucked, rinse, repeat.

37:10.605 --> 37:12.681
I love flea markets.

37:12.816 --> 37:16.267
I once found a vintage Fender.
It was four bucks.

37:16.403 --> 37:18.976
The guy had no idea what he was sitting on.

37:19.114 --> 37:23.325
You know the best thing about
flea markets? Gotta get up early.

37:23.451 --> 37:26.073
Sleep late, nothing there but junk.

37:26.204 --> 37:30.249
- Why are you telling me this?
- I love to get up early.

37:33.003 --> 37:35.838
What's that over there?

37:43.513 --> 37:46.929
- It's beautiful.
- It's yours.

37:47.934 --> 37:50.306
Here.

37:50.437 --> 37:56.724
Oh, no. I know I just took a break
but I'm really not in the mood to take a soul.

37:56.860 --> 37:59.777
George, it's not an assignment.

37:59.904 --> 38:03.238
It's your new address.
Daisy asked me to give it to you.

38:03.366 --> 38:06.071
- Have a great day.
- Oh.

38:36.483 --> 38:39.234
- Well, good morning.
- Hi.

38:40.612 --> 38:43.815
- This is Mason's place.
- He traded with us.

38:43.948 --> 38:48.112
- Why?
- I don't know. He just seemed all sweet.

38:48.244 --> 38:51.495
- Is he on drugs?
- Normally I would say yes.

38:51.623 --> 38:56.368
He said if we're living together it'd
be nice for us to have a nicer place.

38:56.503 --> 39:01.497
What's wrong with you?
You seem... sweet.

39:01.633 --> 39:04.800
- Your room's upstairs.
- Probably a coal cellar.

39:04.928 --> 39:07.845
- Where's your room?
- It's in the back.

39:07.972 --> 39:13.394
It has a nice window but yours is bigger.
I thought you'd like it. But you can choose.

39:13.520 --> 39:17.683
- God, she's a good actress.
- I'll take the big one.

39:17.816 --> 39:20.603
Then we're set.

39:20.735 --> 39:25.113
- Oh. Where's my...?
- Don't worry, your frog's here. It's home.

39:25.240 --> 39:27.197
And so are you, honey.

39:41.548 --> 39:45.332
Travelling alone
holds a certain magic,

39:45.468 --> 39:49.680
a feeling you don't get
when you're forced to ride with the herd.

39:49.806 --> 39:52.297
JD!

39:54.894 --> 39:57.765
JD! What are you doing here?

39:57.897 --> 40:01.681
Then again,
maybe the herd has something to offer,

40:01.818 --> 40:04.107
something I hadn't figured out yet.

40:04.237 --> 40:07.238
All right, name the five Great Lakes.

40:07.365 --> 40:10.734
OK. Michigan, Ontario...

40:10.869 --> 40:13.739
Right? Superior... Your dad's good at this.

40:13.872 --> 40:16.197
- What are the other ones?
- I'm late.

40:16.332 --> 40:19.618
- Michigan.
- She said that one already.

40:36.728 --> 40:40.097
Mom! JD! It's... Hi!

40:40.231 --> 40:41.607
Wow.

40:41.733 --> 40:44.188
Hey, buddy, I was so worried!

40:44.319 --> 40:49.028
It was stupid to put in that doggy door
before I fixed the fence. So stupid.

40:49.157 --> 40:51.565
- Dad.
- What?

40:52.744 --> 40:55.033
Never mind.

41:01.378 --> 41:05.422
Tomorrow I'll go to Happy Time,
tail between my legs,

41:05.548 --> 41:08.170
and ask Delores for my old job.

41:08.968 --> 41:12.219
Maybe dogs always do come back home.

41:16.309 --> 41:19.892
Maybe without even knowing
exactly what home looks like

41:20.021 --> 41:25.442
or where home might be,
there's a mysterious draw.

41:25.568 --> 41:31.073
Maybe the point of continuing
to move through life, and death,

41:31.199 --> 41:33.441
was to find it.

42:14.325 --> 42:16.402
