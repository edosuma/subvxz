WEBVTT

01:02.625 --> 01:04.333
I don't care about hair.

01:04.333 --> 01:07.875
It grows, it shrinks.
You can't get attached.

01:07.875 --> 01:11.125
Plus, you should feel
very confident 'cause
I'm a lot better at this

01:11.125 --> 01:13.917
when I'm not in the middle
of an obsessive-compulsive
meltdown.

01:13.917 --> 01:16.333
( phone chiming )

01:16.333 --> 01:18.291
Fuck.

01:22.333 --> 01:23.708
What?

01:23.708 --> 01:26.208
Wait--

01:26.208 --> 01:28.041
I can't hear you.
Calm down.

01:28.041 --> 01:30.500
Breathe
from your stomach.

01:30.500 --> 01:33.542
- Where are you?
- ( blowing)

01:33.542 --> 01:35.166
Are you serious?

01:37.291 --> 01:39.375
Okay, okay, okay.

01:39.375 --> 01:42.375
1616 India Street.

01:42.375 --> 01:44.333
Yes, see you
in a bit.

01:45.417 --> 01:48.375
Who did you just
give our address to?

01:48.375 --> 01:51.959
- ( pounds table )
- My sister.

01:51.959 --> 01:53.166
I mean, I guess
I should've known

01:53.166 --> 01:55.917
what was going on
from the beginning,
you know?

01:55.917 --> 01:58.917
But he had so many pets
and was so good to them.

01:58.917 --> 02:02.458
How could a man who
loves animals with such
a haunting totality

02:02.458 --> 02:04.542
just turn around
and brutally rebuff me?

02:04.542 --> 02:06.000
- It doesn't make sense.
- It's shocking.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.083
- It is.
- So, I don't
fucking get it.

02:08.083 --> 02:10.708
He just dropped you
by the side of the road?

02:10.708 --> 02:12.000
Yeah, right
to the guardrail.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.750
"Go," he said,
"I'm saving you from me."

02:14.750 --> 02:16.250
I hitched to the nearest
bus station,

02:16.250 --> 02:18.208
and a very sweet,
sad-eyed clerk

02:18.208 --> 02:21.208
took pity on me
and gave me a ticket.
Thank God.

02:21.208 --> 02:23.792
I am so sorry
this happened.

02:23.792 --> 02:24.792
I really am.

02:24.792 --> 02:27.583
Thank you so much.
You're so sweet.

02:27.583 --> 02:31.125
I promise I won't avail
myself of your hospitality
for very long.

02:31.125 --> 02:34.291
Fuck, no.
You're not availing
yourself of it at all.

02:34.291 --> 02:35.667
Adam, we have
a spare room.

02:35.667 --> 02:37.875
We're happy to have you
stay with us for as long
as you need to--

02:37.875 --> 02:39.875
No, she can't.
You're not staying.

02:39.875 --> 02:41.375
You can wipe your nose
with some toilet paper,

02:41.375 --> 02:43.041
then you can
fucking get lost.

02:43.041 --> 02:46.792
I understand
your frustration
with me, Addie,

02:46.792 --> 02:47.834
I really do.

02:47.834 --> 02:51.708
But I have nowhere
to get lost to, okay?

02:51.708 --> 02:53.458
I'm unemployed
and homeless.

02:53.458 --> 02:57.417
I got fired because
apparently nobody trusts
a young, beautiful teacher.

02:57.417 --> 03:00.250
They only want
old, stinky ones.

03:00.250 --> 03:02.166
Horrible double standard
in our culture.

03:02.166 --> 03:05.542
Believe me,
this is the last place
in the world I want to be.

03:05.542 --> 03:07.750
Obviously it's not
the last place because
you're here

03:07.750 --> 03:10.083
even though I told you
you're never welcome
to stay with me again

03:10.083 --> 03:11.458
after you
tried to euthanize
Grandma Helen.

03:11.458 --> 03:13.959
She asked me to!
She said she was terminal!

03:13.959 --> 03:16.458
I'm sorry that I believed
our dying grandma!

03:16.458 --> 03:17.708
There's not
a fucking chance!

03:17.708 --> 03:19.917
Not a fucking chance
in hell, Liney.

03:22.875 --> 03:24.917
I don't know why
you're being so mean
to her, okay?

03:24.917 --> 03:27.583
We have this
whole extra bedroom
for exactly this purpose.

03:27.583 --> 03:30.625
We have all that
fancy soap I stole
from my parents' hotel.

03:30.625 --> 03:31.875
I don't get
why you're doing this.

03:31.875 --> 03:33.125
I know you're
just trying to be nice,

03:33.125 --> 03:34.583
but there is no
being nice to this girl.

03:34.583 --> 03:36.000
She destroys
everything in her wake.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.583
- That's not possible.
- She can't stay.

03:37.583 --> 03:40.291
I know her
better than you do.
Trust me, please.

03:40.291 --> 03:41.625
I'm not being a dick.

03:41.625 --> 03:44.583
- Okay, I trust you.
- Thank you.

03:44.583 --> 03:46.458
You're welcome.

03:48.166 --> 03:50.291
- No.
- Okay.

I don't have the password,
but it is my face, okay?

04:37.792 --> 04:40.667
I am in the video.
I can give you
proof of that.

04:40.667 --> 04:41.959
It's me.

04:41.959 --> 04:44.875
No, it's my--
yeah, it's my face.

04:44.875 --> 04:46.458
I am in the video.
What more do you want?

04:46.458 --> 04:49.166
Do you want me
to send you proof of
identification or something

04:49.166 --> 04:50.834
so you know it's me?
I can do that.

04:50.834 --> 04:55.458
I could, like, text you
my driver's license
or something.

04:55.458 --> 04:56.834
I'm not gonna
ask him for it

04:56.834 --> 04:59.750
because I fucking hate him.
He broke my heart.

04:59.750 --> 05:01.000
He, like, ruined
my fucking life.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.208
I'm not gonna
get in touch with him.

05:03.208 --> 05:05.750
You are a moron!
Seriously?

05:05.750 --> 05:08.500
Why can't you
understand this?

05:08.500 --> 05:09.875
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm sorry.

05:09.875 --> 05:11.917
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

05:11.917 --> 05:14.959
I did not mean to offend you.
I'm really, really sorry.

05:14.959 --> 05:16.208
What's your name?

05:16.208 --> 05:18.708
Marcel?
My name's Marnie.

05:18.708 --> 05:22.000
I really apologize
for losing my temper
at you.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.542
( water shuts off )

05:36.125 --> 05:38.250
Hey, Caroline.

05:38.250 --> 05:40.458
I am so sorry,
but I forgot that my friend,

05:40.458 --> 05:42.917
um, Kerrity is coming
to stay here.

05:42.917 --> 05:44.417
She's an old
gymnastics friend,

05:44.417 --> 05:46.417
and I just don't feel
comfortable leaving her
in the lurch--

05:46.417 --> 05:49.166
I understand.
It's totally okay,
Hannah. I'll be fine.

05:49.166 --> 05:51.792
- Okay, great.
- I'm really not as fragile
as he thinks I am.

05:51.792 --> 05:54.041
- Okay, good.
- I'm really a good
old girl.

05:54.041 --> 05:56.542
- Good.
- But if you did
have some arnica

05:56.542 --> 05:59.834
for these bruises
on my thigh, that would
be so helpful.

05:59.834 --> 06:01.083
Did you
run into something,

06:01.083 --> 06:03.041
or is that more of,
like, an abuse scenario?

06:03.041 --> 06:04.125
'Cause those
are really--

06:04.125 --> 06:05.250
You know, I don't know
what to call

06:05.250 --> 06:06.834
a provoked physical attack
by someone you love.

06:06.834 --> 06:09.166
- I really don't.
- He fucking hit you?

06:09.166 --> 06:12.083
- Where is he now?
- Caroline: It's not
that simple.

06:12.083 --> 06:14.625
You know, I have
a much more complex
view of these things.

06:14.625 --> 06:17.291
I have recently become
just keenly aware

06:17.291 --> 06:20.375
of the challenge that
I present to those who
surround me, and I was--

06:20.375 --> 06:23.000
Do you want to come
to my birthday party?

06:23.000 --> 06:24.792
I mean, I don't know,
it might be totally lame,

06:24.792 --> 06:26.792
and I'm not sure--
my mom and my best friend
are organizing.

06:26.792 --> 06:28.125
It could be
just ridiculous,

06:28.125 --> 06:30.667
but maybe it'll take
your mind off things
and, who knows?

06:30.667 --> 06:32.959
- It would be my honor.
- ( door slams )

06:32.959 --> 06:34.542
- Thank you.
- Good.

06:34.542 --> 06:35.959
- Thank you.
- Good.

06:35.959 --> 06:39.041
Adam, can I borrow pants,
a shirt, and a dickey

06:39.041 --> 06:41.291
for the birthday party,
please?

06:42.250 --> 06:43.375
Did I mention
the drug test

06:43.375 --> 06:45.208
we require
of all new employees?

06:45.208 --> 06:47.125
I'm kidding.
Welcome aboard.

06:47.125 --> 06:48.959
See you next week.

06:50.959 --> 06:52.917
So, is that
the first hire?

06:52.917 --> 06:55.000
Yeah, 'cause you made me
take all the Bad News Bears

06:55.000 --> 06:57.417
from the old location,
which is bullshit.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.458
Loyalty will get you
everywhere.

07:00.458 --> 07:04.041
You know, if you wrote down
all these business lessons,

07:04.041 --> 07:06.792
then you wouldn't have
to spout embarrassing
platitudes in public.

07:06.792 --> 07:08.208
Think about that.

07:08.208 --> 07:11.667
The fact is, Ray,
I won't be spouting
platitudes much longer.

07:11.667 --> 07:14.000
( sighs )
I know, you're sick.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.834
The thing is, if you don't
tell me what you're sick with,

07:15.834 --> 07:17.333
then I can't help you.

07:17.333 --> 07:19.208
And furthermore,
I can't care.

07:19.208 --> 07:21.875
That is
heartwarming, Ray.

07:21.875 --> 07:24.000
Ray, I love you...

07:24.000 --> 07:25.667
like a son.

07:25.667 --> 07:28.667
I love you
like a bastard son.

07:28.667 --> 07:30.959
I love you,
too, Hermie.

07:30.959 --> 07:33.917
I do, and I
have to admit...

07:33.917 --> 07:36.125
I'm kinda scared,
you know?

07:36.125 --> 07:39.208
Life can be terrifying,
even if you're not sick.

07:39.208 --> 07:41.250
No, no, I'm scared
of being a boss.

07:41.250 --> 07:44.041
Like, a real,
legitimate boss,
you know?

07:44.041 --> 07:46.041
Of making decisions
for the entire team.

07:46.041 --> 07:49.041
Of having boundaries
and respecting those
boundaries.

07:49.041 --> 07:51.542
Of being the type
of man that can handle
all this shit.

07:51.542 --> 07:52.875
It's simple, Ray.

07:52.875 --> 07:55.333
Don't hit anyone,
don't shtup anyone,

07:55.333 --> 07:57.291
clean so that rats
don't get tempted,

07:57.291 --> 07:58.917
and you got yourself
a business.

07:58.917 --> 08:00.834
Don't shtup anybody?

08:00.834 --> 08:03.375
- Yeah.
- Okay, okay.

08:03.375 --> 08:05.667
All right. If it's really
that simple, I can do that.

08:05.667 --> 08:07.500
I can do that for you,
but I'm telling you,

08:07.500 --> 08:08.875
you're gonna
outlive us all.

08:08.875 --> 08:11.667
You'll see, you're gonna be
like Ingmar fucking Bergman.

08:11.667 --> 08:13.291
He said he was
gonna die every day.

08:13.291 --> 08:16.792
He lived to
his late 80s on his own
private Swedish island.

08:16.792 --> 08:18.542
Think about it, Hermie.

08:19.542 --> 08:22.125

08:24.208 --> 08:27.208

- Marnie: Yay!

08:31.000 --> 08:32.792
Holla!

08:32.792 --> 08:34.500
Happy birthday!

08:34.500 --> 08:36.917
- Surprise!
- It's not a surprise party.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.750
- Oh.
- I'm still so excited.

08:38.750 --> 08:40.082
I have no idea
why he said that.

08:40.082 --> 08:41.833
- I specifically
told him not to.
- I forgot.

08:41.833 --> 08:44.917
This is so amazing
that you guys are
doing this for me.

08:44.917 --> 08:46.792
We're just paying.
Marnie's done so much.

08:46.792 --> 08:48.625
I can't believe
you're turning 25.

08:48.625 --> 08:50.917
- Where does the time go?
- I don't know.

08:50.917 --> 08:53.250
- Tad: You look so wonderful.
- Thank you.

08:53.250 --> 08:54.375
Doesn't she?
I keep telling her

08:54.375 --> 08:56.417
she could look like this
every day if she wanted.

08:56.417 --> 08:59.542
Loreen:
You really look
great, sweetie.

08:59.542 --> 09:01.583
Oh, um, this is Adam's
sister, Caroline.

09:01.583 --> 09:05.125
- Oh, hi.
- Just so healthy
and clean...

09:05.125 --> 09:07.834
- and just, you know, wow.
- Hannah: Mom, I get it.

09:07.834 --> 09:09.417
Hey.

09:09.417 --> 09:10.667
Oh, hi.

09:10.667 --> 09:13.291
- Oh, golly.
- Adam: Okay, okay, okay.
That's enough.

09:13.291 --> 09:16.375
And you remember
Adam from my period
of mental illness.

09:16.375 --> 09:18.250
Hey, so fucking good
to see you, Mr. Horvath.

09:18.250 --> 09:20.458
- You're fucking right.
- Mrs. Horvath.

09:20.458 --> 09:22.417
- How are you?
- Just a family affair, huh?

09:22.417 --> 09:25.000
It's great you
could make it, Caroline.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.458
Anyway, so you guys
should all go get drinks.

09:27.458 --> 09:29.917
We're paying for all of
the liquor until 10:00 PM.

09:29.917 --> 09:31.291
We  are paying?

09:31.291 --> 09:32.917
And if you do
want to get a drink,

09:32.917 --> 09:35.291
just use the passcode,
which is "banana."

09:35.291 --> 09:36.750
Banana.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.750
- Banana, banana.
- Marnie: Shh.

09:38.750 --> 09:41.417
Yep, it is, and if
you say it too loudly,

09:41.417 --> 09:43.208
everyone else will hear it
and then they'll get
free drinks,

09:43.208 --> 09:44.583
so just keep it
to yourself.

09:44.583 --> 09:47.500
I'm gonna
show you around.

09:47.500 --> 09:48.875
Hannah...

09:48.875 --> 09:50.291
I'll be right back.

09:50.291 --> 09:52.375
So, Caroline,
how old are you?

09:53.750 --> 09:56.667
I love your hat.

09:56.667 --> 09:57.875
You're so great
to do this,

09:57.875 --> 09:59.792
especially considering
everything you're
dealing with

09:59.792 --> 10:01.708
- with Charlie and--
- Are you joking?

10:01.708 --> 10:04.375
This is, like, the nicest
distraction for me to have.

10:04.375 --> 10:06.834
It's so good for me to,
like, throw myself into this.

10:06.834 --> 10:08.166
And I'll have a bunch
of party pictures

10:08.166 --> 10:10.708
that I can post to Instagram
'cause I know he checks it.

10:10.708 --> 10:13.083
- He definitely checks it.
- He fucking checks it.

10:13.083 --> 10:16.125
- Happy birthday, boo!
- Hi, how are you, Tako?

10:16.125 --> 10:18.166
Happy birthday.
This is Prietta.

10:18.166 --> 10:20.500
- Hey, good to meet you.
- My love. Where's Adam?

10:20.500 --> 10:23.041
He's stuck with my parents.
Please go rescue him.

10:23.041 --> 10:24.417
- I'll be back.
- Sorry.

10:24.417 --> 10:26.041
I just have something
to show you.

10:26.041 --> 10:28.166
Awesome.
Laird!

10:28.166 --> 10:29.458
Laird: Hannah, hi.

10:29.458 --> 10:31.792
On the occasion of your
birthday, I present---

10:31.792 --> 10:33.500
You know what?
You can just go ahead
and leave that

10:33.500 --> 10:36.208
- in the back room with
the rest of the presents.
- I am so sorry. Bye, Laird.

10:36.208 --> 10:38.959
- Tinu! Hi!
- Oh, hey! Happy birthday.

10:38.959 --> 10:41.375
- No.
- I'll find you
in a second.

10:41.375 --> 10:43.291
Just really quick.

10:44.834 --> 10:47.000
- Boo.
- Oh, my God!

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
- Happy birthday!
- Hello, darling.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.625
- Hi.
- You look-- mwah--
amaze, birthday girl.

10:52.625 --> 10:55.708
- Thank you.
- I have some drinks
for everybody.

10:55.708 --> 10:57.583
This is great.
Cheers.

10:57.583 --> 10:59.542
Twenty fucking five.

10:59.542 --> 11:00.875
- That's how old I am.
- Oh, my God.

11:00.875 --> 11:02.458
I cannot believe it.
How does it feel?

11:02.458 --> 11:04.208
- It feels great.
- Shoshanna: Yeah?

11:04.208 --> 11:05.542
Being 25 is great.

11:05.542 --> 11:06.959
It's really amazing
that all three of you

11:06.959 --> 11:09.417
have accomplished
so little in the four
years since college.

11:09.417 --> 11:11.417
I mean,
think about it.
Four years.

11:11.417 --> 11:13.500
Four years
is, like, nothing.

11:13.500 --> 11:15.583
Your 21st birthday
feels like yesterday to me.

11:15.583 --> 11:18.041
Do you remember,
we sang the duet
from "Rent"?

11:18.041 --> 11:19.750
Oh, my God, we sang
"Take Me or Leave Me."

11:19.750 --> 11:22.375
- It was atrocious.
- It was so fun.

11:22.375 --> 11:25.000
It was the happiest
we've ever been, remember?

11:25.000 --> 11:27.417
We should do it again.
There's a stage right there.

11:27.417 --> 11:30.125
Marnie, I cherish you
on an interpersonal level,

11:30.125 --> 11:32.417
I love this party.
The last thing I want to do

11:32.417 --> 11:34.250
is sing anything
from "Rent."

11:34.250 --> 11:36.291
Okay.

11:36.291 --> 11:39.333

11:39.333 --> 11:41.583
Marnie: Guys,
I really wish you weren't
watching this right now.

11:41.583 --> 11:43.750
Hannah: Marnie, shh,
it's not that bad.

11:43.750 --> 11:45.125
I just-- Charlie
made me do it

11:45.125 --> 11:46.792
and then he, like,
put it on YouTube

11:46.792 --> 11:48.458
and he was like,
"Ta-da."

11:48.458 --> 11:51.792
But I should've
been like, "Fuck you.
Here's the video."

11:51.792 --> 11:54.875
Marnie, you were
definitely complicit
in the creation of this.

11:54.875 --> 11:56.625
Shoshanna:
Why don't you just call him
and ask for his password?

11:56.625 --> 11:58.125
Marnie:
I don't want to
fucking call him,

11:58.125 --> 12:00.000
and I do not want
to know his password.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.458
Maybe his password
is, "I shape my pubes
into a neat box."

12:04.625 --> 12:06.917
People are so mean
in the comment section.

12:06.917 --> 12:08.125
Oh, my God,
it's crazy.

12:08.125 --> 12:10.500
"Please stab this Disney
princess in the face

12:10.500 --> 12:12.041
and shut her
the fuck up."

12:12.041 --> 12:14.542
Don't--
I don't want to read--
I don't read comments.

14:06.417 --> 14:08.917
This guy apparently
hates serving people.

14:08.917 --> 14:11.583
It's like his biggest

14:11.583 --> 14:15.083

himself one of these

Good man, indeed.

14:37.125 --> 14:39.125
So, what brings you
out here tonight, Kobi?

14:39.125 --> 14:42.333
Why does any guy
come to a place where
there's dancing?

14:42.333 --> 14:43.625
A girl told me to come.

you guys meet?

14:57.875 --> 14:59.291
On the street, actually.

14:59.291 --> 15:01.959
- On the street?
- This girl is crazy.

15:01.959 --> 15:03.375

and she just screams,

15:03.375 --> 15:05.875
"Hey, hottie.
You know where I can
find some dank weed?"

15:05.875 --> 15:09.458
So I'm telling her,
and then her and her friends
pull me into a cab with them.

15:12.375 --> 15:13.750

15:35.083 --> 15:36.625

she starts out great,

in Prospect Heights...

- Oh, wow.
- Which is really nice.

you may remember,

17:21.458 --> 17:23.290
is a decorator for
restaurants out in Syosset,

17:23.290 --> 17:26.290
so she's really
helping me get the place
all slicked out,

17:26.290 --> 17:27.834
looking legit.

17:27.834 --> 17:29.166
- Right.
- So that's nice.

17:29.166 --> 17:31.250
And the new Grumpy's

17:31.250 --> 17:33.708

I am so glad
you could make it.

19:18.208 --> 19:20.500
Then you should have
invited me.

19:20.500 --> 19:22.708
Not that
I would've accepted.

19:22.708 --> 19:24.208
I just happened to be
in the neighborhood

19:24.208 --> 19:26.542
because somebody
bitched out on me yet again.

19:26.542 --> 19:28.959

that I requested

21:48.625 --> 21:50.792
and started playing
this piece of shit song?

21:50.792 --> 21:52.208
