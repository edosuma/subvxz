16:00.733 --> 16:04.089
...one of which is finding souls
or entities across dimensions.

16:04.253 --> 16:05.288
ANGEL:
Entities like...?

16:06.653 --> 16:07.802
Cordelia.

16:08.253 --> 16:09.652
Wow.

16:10.053 --> 16:11.406
That's just...

16:11.933 --> 16:15.642
Oh, hey, baby, I liked your little...
Your ghost guy.

16:15.853 --> 16:17.286
I haven't slept, Charles.

16:18.093 --> 16:19.845
So we need the Axis.
How do we get it?

16:20.013 --> 16:23.801
Currently, the Axis is being held
in a vault in Chandler's Auction House...

16:24.373 --> 16:26.841
...an establishment firmly rooted
in the black market.

16:27.013 --> 16:30.562
Black market means money.
Money means security.

16:30.733 --> 16:33.611
But not to worry, because
I beat the building plans...

16:33.773 --> 16:35.729
...out of a snitch
who thought I was dead.

16:35.933 --> 16:37.366
The plans are only half of it.

16:37.533 --> 16:40.570
Just because we know where it is
doesn't mean we can get to it.

16:41.573 --> 16:45.532
- Surveillance cameras, electric gates.
- Laser sensors, handprint recognition.

16:45.693 --> 16:47.570
Not to mention armed guards.

16:47.853 --> 16:50.367
But if it's an auction house,
can't we just eBay it?

16:50.533 --> 16:51.648
How much is it?

16:51.813 --> 16:52.928
33 million dollars.

16:54.213 --> 16:56.044
I think my lungs have coffee.

16:57.133 --> 16:59.283
I'm still working on a plan...

16:59.453 --> 17:03.207
...but so far it involves being sent to
prison and becoming somebody's bitch.

17:03.373 --> 17:04.726
ANGEL:
Nobody's going to jail.

17:04.893 --> 17:08.124
I told you, a heist like this,
I've done it a million times.

17:09.813 --> 17:12.531
Okay, maybe twice.
But I'm good at it, I swear.

17:12.693 --> 17:15.765
You're not counting the time we
stole the crazy-making death shroud...

17:15.933 --> 17:17.412
...that nearly killed us, right?

17:18.093 --> 17:20.732
This is how we find Cordy,
so this is what we're gonna do.

17:21.252 --> 17:26.566
Okay. I'm just gonna take these
and go over the details...

17:26.733 --> 17:30.851
...and see if I can, I don't know,
whip something up.

17:31.013 --> 17:32.685
Say, a plan.

17:34.093 --> 17:35.731
Okay.

17:36.733 --> 17:39.008
- I'm really strong, if that helps.
- Okay.

17:39.173 --> 17:41.562
That's my girl. Large and in charge.

17:41.733 --> 17:43.963
Okay, teensy-weensy and in charge.

17:44.133 --> 17:46.806
It's amazing the way she
stepped up while I was gone.

17:47.453 --> 17:49.489
Kind of reminds me of Cordy.

17:50.373 --> 17:55.401
Angel, say we use this Axis thing
to find her. What then?

17:55.613 --> 18:00.368
Then we do whatever it takes to get
her back home where she belongs.

18:01.613 --> 18:04.173
So, what are we gonna need
for Operation Chance in Hell?

18:04.733 --> 18:08.692
We can only guess.
Probably some rappelling hooks.

18:09.813 --> 18:11.804
Flashlights, obviously.

18:13.173 --> 18:14.526
Aerosols.

You mean the way you
let your little slave girl go?

19:16.453 --> 19:18.409
Justine, is it?

19:18.693 --> 19:20.490
So you finally heard about that.

19:20.653 --> 19:23.929
I heard. I'm betting she
heard a few things too.

19:24.733 --> 19:27.042
The walls are soundproofed.

19:28.133 --> 19:30.886
But she did call you "impossibly loud."

through your teeth.

19:35.933 --> 19:40.165
"Wes is so apathetic.
Wesley doesn't care."

19:40.333 --> 19:44.804

kicked Connor out of the hotel.

I don't need to hear your evil plans.

knowing I have them.

It doesn't, does it?

33:24.973 --> 33:26.452
Cordelia.

33:26.893 --> 33:29.930
- I gotta get out of here.
- What the hell is going on?

33:30.093 --> 33:31.731
ELLIOT:
Well, that should be obvious.

33:32.333 --> 33:34.244
To a professional like yourself.

33:35.213 --> 33:36.487
It's a double-cross.

33:36.853 --> 33:40.732
I'm not slow. I know it's...
Shut up.

33:41.533 --> 33:42.568
Is he one of yours?

33:42.733 --> 33:46.282
No. I thought he was yours,
what with the tonguing and all.

33:46.493 --> 33:48.051
- In his dreams.
- Not even close.

33:48.253 --> 33:50.164
ELLIOT:
It doesn't matter.

33:50.453 --> 33:53.013
The job's done, Elliot.
You don't have to do this.

33:53.173 --> 33:56.165
I had no choice. The job you
did for me was a train wreck.

33:56.373 --> 33:59.888
The noise, the publicity.
That little stunt you pulled in the bar.

34:00.053 --> 34:01.088
That was just a joke.

34:01.253 --> 34:05.769
Professionals are discreet, young lady.
You, on the other hand, are a freak.

34:07.013 --> 34:08.047
A dangerous...

34:08.773 --> 34:10.411
...freak.

34:13.373 --> 34:16.763
Which is why I had them remodel
the elevator you're standing in.

34:17.053 --> 34:18.610
More of a retrofit, really.

34:18.813 --> 34:22.248
Low-teched the thing with 6 inches
of Plexiglas separating you from...

34:22.413 --> 34:24.643
...any available current.

34:25.172 --> 34:26.242
Tempered Lucite.

34:26.773 --> 34:30.607
- He's gonna seal us in. Turn on the gas.
- What are you, Lex Luthor?

34:30.773 --> 34:33.844
Do you think I'm gonna duke it out
with Electro-girl?

34:34.013 --> 34:37.688
No, don't worry.
I'm told that the gas is very fast-acting.

34:37.853 --> 34:40.083
You'll be dead within...

34:40.652 --> 34:42.052
Whoops.

34:42.693 --> 34:44.092
Where does the time go?

34:50.172 --> 34:51.686
Okay, there's gotta be something.

34:54.373 --> 34:56.409
Get down. Now. Get low!

34:56.572 --> 34:59.371
- You jackass! You get low.
- I don't need to. I don't breathe.

34:59.533 --> 35:02.730
- Must be a turn-on for the girlfriend.
- Utility panel here, you think?

35:02.893 --> 35:05.691
Plastic's too thick, you lunkhead,
I can't get through.

35:05.853 --> 35:08.287
- Simple question: Is it here or not?
- Yes, it's there.

35:14.493 --> 35:17.371
We should be finished here
anytime now.

35:17.533 --> 35:21.685
Uh-huh. I see. Uh-huh.

35:23.293 --> 35:26.205
Well, we had the tuna casserole
last Thursday, Molly.

35:26.373 --> 35:28.204
[COUGHING]

35:29.373 --> 35:32.570
- In case I die...
- You're not gonna die.

35:34.533 --> 35:35.886
Nice kiss.

35:38.853 --> 35:40.252
ANGEL:
Hey.

35:51.773 --> 35:52.762
Get rid of him.

36:09.293 --> 36:12.410
GWEN: I expect to get screwed.
Professional thief.

36:12.573 --> 36:14.723
- Hazard of the biz.
- Wait a second, please.

36:14.893 --> 36:18.203
What I don't appreciate, Elliot,
is being called a freak.

36:18.773 --> 36:22.322
That's my word, and I get cranky
when people like you use it.

36:22.493 --> 36:23.608
Gwen, think about this.

36:23.893 --> 36:28.683
You ever been struck by lightning, Elliot?
I've been struck by lightning 14 times.

36:29.013 --> 36:32.005
It's not my fault. I just attract it.

36:32.213 --> 36:35.569
You know what also attracts lightning?
Maggoty little norms like you.

36:35.733 --> 36:39.123
So you're a freak. Boo-hoo.
So what?

36:39.293 --> 36:41.204
- Excuse me?
ANGEL: You've figured out...

36:41.373 --> 36:43.091
...I'm not the poster boy for normal.

36:43.253 --> 36:46.211
Sometimes you gotta let go.

36:48.013 --> 36:49.924
Hey, I wanted to do that.

36:50.093 --> 36:51.572
- You were gonna fry him.
- Was not.

36:51.733 --> 36:53.212
- Don't fib.
- Fine.

36:53.373 --> 36:55.091
Did you at least break his nose?

37:01.373 --> 37:04.171
You're gonna use that Axis thing
to find her, aren't you?

37:07.773 --> 37:09.286
Figures.

37:10.093 --> 37:13.972
Anyone that bad at stealing stuff's
gotta be doing it for love.

37:15.453 --> 37:16.727
Bummer.

37:39.693 --> 37:41.604
Do you think he found her?

37:50.053 --> 37:51.566
Yeah.

38:17.413 --> 38:19.404
She was beautiful?

38:20.013 --> 38:21.765
God...

38:23.813 --> 38:26.725
...there was all this light around her.

38:26.973 --> 38:28.804
And the light seemed to be made up...

38:31.893 --> 38:33.565
...of pure joy.

38:35.373 --> 38:36.852
And warmth.

38:37.853 --> 38:41.562
You think higher beings
get to take vacations?

38:42.853 --> 38:45.845
The way I saw it,
it felt sort of permanent.

38:46.893 --> 38:50.442
Too bad. Could have all gone to Vegas.

38:51.293 --> 38:54.330
We should've known back when she
started doing that glowy thing...

38:54.493 --> 38:57.803
...the Powers were up to something.
GUNN: Who thought it would be this?

38:59.733 --> 39:02.122
Tell you the truth, doesn't surprise me.

39:02.573 --> 39:04.609
In some small way...

39:04.773 --> 39:09.403
...maybe it even makes it easier
knowing the good she's doing up there.

39:10.253 --> 39:15.691
Even if I can't see her or talk to her,
it's like she's still on my side.

39:16.573 --> 39:20.930
- Doesn't mean you miss her any less.
- No.

39:24.533 --> 39:27.093
All those months under the water...

39:27.253 --> 39:30.643
...I kept thinking to myself,
"I gotta get home to Cordelia."

39:31.533 --> 39:34.809
I get back, and I find out
that she's gone.

39:35.013 --> 39:38.608
I keep thinking,
"I gotta get Cordy back home."

39:39.973 --> 39:43.090
Finally I find her, and I realize...

39:44.893 --> 39:46.770
...she already is home...

39:53.373 --> 39:55.523
...where she belongs.

40:09.133 --> 40:13.445
What are you, deficient?
Get me out of here!
