'Try to blend in...'

00:05.240 --> 00:07.759
I'm Franky Fitzgerald.
It's my first day.

00:07.760 --> 00:10.279
I'm...really sorry.
The brakes were fucked.

00:10.280 --> 00:11.599
Has the circus come to town

00:11.600 --> 00:13.239
'Who is this chick?'

00:13.240 --> 00:14.119
Pussy.

00:14.120 --> 00:14.919
Think her name's Mini.

00:14.920 --> 00:16.318
She's fucked.

00:16.320 --> 00:18.919
We're Franky's new friends.
Friends...?

00:18.920 --> 00:20.439
'You've never worn make-up before!'

00:20.440 --> 00:24.439
Do I look like
a bulimic fucking Barbie?!

00:24.560 --> 00:28.559
Oh, my God. I...thought
something like his might happen.

00:29.200 --> 00:32.839
Fuck you all!

00:32.840 --> 00:36.839
Welcome to Bristol, Frankie.

Rich...

01:47.840 --> 01:50.159
Rich, mate.

01:50.160 --> 01:52.119
Rich!

01:52.120 --> 01:54.559
Sorry.

01:57.080 --> 02:00.919
I want you to meet someone.
..This is Rich.

02:00.920 --> 02:02.359
Hi.

02:02.360 --> 02:05.999
I'm Arabella and this is Sally.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.079
So, what were you listening to?

02:08.080 --> 02:11.799
You wouldn't like it.

02:15.320 --> 02:16.919
No, no, no. No, Rich, please...

02:16.920 --> 02:18.599
Actually, we made a playlist, so...

02:18.600 --> 02:20.319
I'm not with him.

02:24.200 --> 02:26.319
Now, this...

02:26.320 --> 02:28.319
is music.

02:28.320 --> 02:30.319
Angel Of Death
Turn it off!

02:30.320 --> 02:32.719
Turn it fucking off! Turn it off!

02:32.720 --> 02:36.719
Wait - this is a good bit
coming up...

02:37.320 --> 02:40.679
Slaye-e-e-e-er!

02:40.680 --> 02:44.679
Oof!

02:46.080 --> 02:50.079
You dick!

02:52.080 --> 02:55.919
I'm never going to get laid
if you keep being such a douche

02:55.920 --> 02:57.639
to all the dames we meet.

02:57.640 --> 03:00.359
That's because all the girls we meet
are always arseholes.

03:00.360 --> 03:04.159
I don't care if they're
one-legged, dead hermaphrodites,

03:04.160 --> 03:06.839
I need some sex - soon.

03:06.840 --> 03:09.559
It'll never happen if you actlike
an axe wound all the time.

03:09.560 --> 03:11.639
I'm not wasting my time

03:11.640 --> 03:15.639
on peroxide-sodden
Miley Cyrus Cowellistas.

03:15.680 --> 03:17.559
You'resofull of shit. >

03:17.560 --> 03:21.439
So, if a tasty metalhead piece
of clunge wandered into your life,

03:21.440 --> 03:23.959
you'd ask her out - straight away

03:23.960 --> 03:27.959
Yeah. And...she'd say yes.

03:30.920 --> 03:32.999
Right...

03:33.000 --> 03:34.799
Well, then,
I'm going to find you one.

03:34.800 --> 03:37.799
I'm going to partner you up! >

03:37.800 --> 03:40.999
I'll be like Cilla Black...
with a dick.

03:43.040 --> 03:47.039
This'll be easy. College Green
is swarming with the fuckers.

03:56.720 --> 04:00.599
She can't be fat, though.

04:00.600 --> 04:02.039
Bollocks.

04:07.720 --> 04:11.719
..floor!

04:12.680 --> 04:16.678
? Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

04:22.200 --> 04:23.999
One!
# ..nothing wrong with me

04:24.000 --> 04:25.759
Two!
# ..nothing wrong with me

04:25.760 --> 04:29.639
? Three, nothing wrong with me
Four, nothing wrong with me

04:29.640 --> 04:33.639
? One, something's got to give
Two, something's got to give

04:33.680 --> 04:37.279
? Three, something's got to give... ?
PHONE RINGS

04:39.760 --> 04:43.759
Hello?
'Rich - college, now!'

04:47.000 --> 04:50.039
Morning. Off to college, are we?

04:50.040 --> 04:52.759
Yes, Kevin,
that's where I go every day.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.239
I really wish you wouldn't call me
Kevin, I'm your dad.

04:55.240 --> 04:58.359
Yeah, well, I'm going now.

04:58.360 --> 05:00.599
Have a good day, then.

05:00.600 --> 05:04.599
I love you!
Yeah, whatever.

05:13.960 --> 05:16.479
Right, what's going on?

05:16.480 --> 05:20.479
What?

05:20.640 --> 05:22.239
Why are we holding hands...?

05:22.240 --> 05:26.239
Get...

05:33.760 --> 05:35.199
Right, what?

05:35.200 --> 05:37.759
I give you...

06:08.880 --> 06:12.759
So...go and talk to her.

06:12.760 --> 06:16.199
No, but...
Look at her, mate!

06:16.200 --> 06:20.199
Remember what you said.

06:23.200 --> 06:26.599
Fine...

06:50.240 --> 06:51.679
Hi...

06:54.120 --> 06:57.959
I, um...er...

06:57.960 --> 07:00.279
..um...

07:01.520 --> 07:04.479
Um... Oh...

07:04.480 --> 07:06.279
Your T-shirt, that's...

07:06.280 --> 07:07.999
Ha-ha! Um...

07:10.920 --> 07:13.559
I...I was just...

07:13.560 --> 07:15.239
..looking for a book.

07:15.240 --> 07:17.119
Yeah, here it is.

07:17.120 --> 07:20.839
Ha-ha! Ah.I've...
been looking for this for ages.

07:24.480 --> 07:28.479
Er...anyway um...bye.

07:31.960 --> 07:35.959
So...
Shut the fuck up, Alo.

07:43.720 --> 07:46.799
You need help, Richard.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.399
No, I don't.

07:48.400 --> 07:51.239
OK, you gave me
barely any time to prepare, Alo.

07:51.240 --> 07:55.239
I haven't even had breakfast yet.
Bollocks. You're terrible.

07:55.600 --> 07:59.079
You need someone to teach you
the ways of the woman.

07:59.080 --> 08:00.959
The method of the muff.

08:00.960 --> 08:03.279
The Tao of...

08:03.280 --> 08:05.359
tit-fuckery.

08:05.360 --> 08:08.919
And that's you, is it, Alo? Yeah?

08:08.920 --> 08:12.919
The guy who masturbates
so much that his hand
is now a shrivelled wank claw.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.679
I've got most of the movement back
now, haven't I?

08:15.680 --> 08:17.839
Maybe you're right, though.

08:17.840 --> 08:21.119
I mean, we need someone
who properly knows girls,

08:21.120 --> 08:23.399
but isn't going to think we're weird.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.999
Like a girl.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.919
But not like...

08:28.920 --> 08:32.919
well, not like a girl.

08:33.799 --> 08:37.159
Look, Rich, I can see your problem,
but you've come to the wrong place.

08:37.159 --> 08:39.599
I can't help you.

08:39.600 --> 08:43.399
I mean, I don't know
anything about girls either.

08:43.400 --> 08:46.039
I don't have a mum or a sister.

08:46.040 --> 08:48.879
My experience of girls
is mostly being beaten up by them.

08:48.880 --> 08:51.719
Oh, we're fucked, then.No.

08:51.720 --> 08:54.799
Wait. I know someone who can help.

08:54.800 --> 08:58.079
Ah! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

08:58.080 --> 09:02.079
Fur Elise

09:25.360 --> 09:28.199
You can see her vag
through that leotard.

09:28.200 --> 09:32.199
Oh!
What are you guys doing here?

09:32.200 --> 09:36.199
Rich here needs help.
Hi, Rich.

09:36.240 --> 09:39.639
Hi.
What can I do for you?

09:39.640 --> 09:43.639
He needs help talking to girls.
Ooh!Is someone in love?

09:45.360 --> 09:49.359
There's this girl
who works in the library. And...

09:50.480 --> 09:52.559
Gracie!

09:52.560 --> 09:55.839
Oh.

09:55.840 --> 09:59.839
Wotcha.

10:01.280 --> 10:05.279
What are you doing in here?
Talking to Grace.

10:05.880 --> 10:08.999
Why? Is that like a problem,
or something?

10:09.000 --> 10:10.839
Oh, no.

10:10.840 --> 10:12.959
I can't tell you
where you can and can't be

10:12.960 --> 10:15.279
or stop you from talking to Gracie,
can I?

10:15.280 --> 10:16.839
No, you can't.

10:16.840 --> 10:20.839
I mean, we were just wondering if
Gracie's still coming for that mocha.

10:21.440 --> 10:25.439
Weren't we, Liv?
Yeah, come on, Gracie.

10:25.440 --> 10:29.439
Hey, I can see your...
your vag through that leotard.

10:30.480 --> 10:34.479
I can honestly say I have
absolutely no, repeat,
no problem with it at all.

10:34.480 --> 10:38.479
I mean, if she wants to stay and chat
with inbreds and lesbos and nerds.

10:38.720 --> 10:42.719
Hey, no, hang on a fucking minute.
Fuck off back to Valhalla, weirdo.

10:43.240 --> 10:46.119
Valhalla? Oh, let me guess.

10:46.120 --> 10:49.359
That's a reference
to my taste in music, right?

10:51.960 --> 10:55.319
Are you coming, Gracie?Yeah.

10:55.320 --> 10:58.719
I'll, er...see you guys.

11:02.600 --> 11:04.599
Great

11:36.120 --> 11:38.519
Er...hi.

11:40.080 --> 11:44.079
How can I help you?

11:44.280 --> 11:46.159
Grace?

11:46.160 --> 11:47.639
Yep, it's me.

11:47.640 --> 11:50.319
Oh, fucking hell.
What's with the disguise?

11:50.320 --> 11:53.199
Oh, I think it's best
if I stay undercover.

11:53.200 --> 11:56.079
Mini will be happier
if she doesn't know about it.

11:56.080 --> 11:58.879
The last thing I wanted to do
is upset anyone.

11:58.880 --> 12:02.319
Mm, how valiant of you
I know, right?

12:02.320 --> 12:04.759
So, I've decided to help you.

12:04.760 --> 12:08.399
I don't think that's a good idea.
Why not?

12:08.400 --> 12:12.399
No offence, but you
kind of represent everything
I despise in the world.

12:13.680 --> 12:15.719
Oh, don't be silly, Richard.

12:15.720 --> 12:19.319
My mum always says opposites attract.

12:19.320 --> 12:22.959
That's magnets. We're people.

12:22.960 --> 12:24.559
Come on.

12:24.560 --> 12:27.039
What?Take me to her.

12:27.040 --> 12:29.759
Who?The girl you like. Come on.

12:35.920 --> 12:38.559
Come on, then.

12:45.160 --> 12:49.159
Wow, she's pretty.
Why is she wearing a dog collar?

12:51.280 --> 12:55.039
Cos she's a metalhead.
What's a metalhead?

12:55.040 --> 12:56.759
What?

12:56.760 --> 13:00.479
This is. Me. I'm a metalhead.
I like metal music.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.799
Why do you think I dress like this?

13:02.800 --> 13:04.919
I thought it was a joke
No, it's not a joke.

13:04.920 --> 13:08.679
You know, I'm not a fucking clown
dressing up silly to make you laugh.

13:08.680 --> 13:11.359
This is me. This is who I am.

13:11.360 --> 13:14.359
Forget it. This will never work.
But it will work.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.959
You may not know this about me, Rich,

13:16.960 --> 13:19.199
but I'm not only a dancer,
I'm an actor as well.

13:19.200 --> 13:21.319
Right, how's that going to help
anything?

13:21.320 --> 13:25.319
Using acting, I shall inhabit
the role of "the metalhead",

13:25.680 --> 13:29.559
and whilst I'm in character,
you can practise chatting her up.

13:29.560 --> 13:33.319
That's the worst idea since
genocide. Possibly even worse.

13:33.320 --> 13:36.959
Why would you ever want to do that?

13:36.960 --> 13:39.079
Fun.No way.

13:39.080 --> 13:43.079
What other choice have you got,
Richard?

13:48.280 --> 13:50.479
All right, fine.Great.

13:50.480 --> 13:53.479
Now all you have to do
is help me get into character.

13:53.480 --> 13:57.479
Fine!

13:58.080 --> 14:02.079
Right, come with me.

14:10.920 --> 14:14.919
Yo, yo, Rich. How you doing, bro?
I got your tickets.

14:15.840 --> 14:16.959
How much?There you go.

14:16.960 --> 14:20.679
Brilliant.

14:20.680 --> 14:23.119
It's going to be fucking sweet.
Yeah.

14:23.120 --> 14:25.199
What's that?

14:25.200 --> 14:28.159
Napalm Death.
Biggest gig of the year.

14:28.160 --> 14:31.119
They haven't played in the city
since... Atomic Kitten were big.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.279
Oh. Maybe we can go together.

14:33.280 --> 14:37.279
No, if I went with you,
I wouldn't want to go.

14:37.440 --> 14:41.439
Who is this nice young lady that you
are not taking to the gig, Rich?

14:41.720 --> 14:45.039
Grace. She's just a mate.
How you doing, Grace?

14:45.040 --> 14:47.719
Not even a mate.
She's more of an acquaintance.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.079
Hello, Toxic Bob.How you doing?

14:50.080 --> 14:52.119
Oh, what's that?

14:52.120 --> 14:56.039
This behind me is Misplaced
Abortion's third record.

14:56.040 --> 14:59.359
Apparently Dirk Strangle,
the singer, he went loopy
after they made it.

14:59.360 --> 15:03.239
It is said to be the heaviest,
loudest record of all time.

15:03.240 --> 15:05.839
Only three in existence.
Have you listened to it?

15:05.840 --> 15:08.279
No, no, no. You can't listen to it.
It's way too heavy.

15:08.280 --> 15:11.359
And to the normal human brain
it doesn't make any sense.

15:11.360 --> 15:14.039
And to most of us,
it sounds like silence.

15:14.040 --> 15:17.479
That makes no sense.
I know.

15:17.480 --> 15:19.519
What a surprise.
She doesn't understand.

15:19.520 --> 15:22.759
You've never heard of these guys?
It's fucking retarded, right?

15:22.760 --> 15:24.599
Mind if I play her a few things?

15:24.600 --> 15:25.759
Knock yourselves out.

15:25.760 --> 15:28.079
I'll give you something light
to ease you in.

15:32.920 --> 15:35.359
Ready?

15:50.720 --> 15:53.159
I think you might like this.

15:53.160 --> 15:57.159
Grab them headphones.
It won't be like last time.
All right, are you ready?

15:57.240 --> 16:01.239
My Plague

16:01.880 --> 16:04.359
Better, right?
How much is it?

16:04.360 --> 16:06.839
Well, I tell you what, you
can take it...take it as a gift

16:06.840 --> 16:08.919
cos I feel bad you passed out,
and all that stuff.

16:08.920 --> 16:12.119
If you don't like it, bring it back.
What, free metal?

16:12.120 --> 16:15.119
Where's my free metal?
You never give out free metal.

16:15.120 --> 16:18.359
Just cos she's got those and that.
Oh!

16:18.360 --> 16:22.359
Sod off, you...sod!

16:24.600 --> 16:27.279
Rich, let me tell you a story.

16:27.280 --> 16:30.879
I told Dave Mustaine this
in 1983 and I think it
bears repeating today.

16:30.880 --> 16:32.639
What?

16:32.640 --> 16:35.919
Don't be an ass hat
and people will like you more.

16:55.360 --> 16:57.679
You need to be nicer to me, Rich.

16:57.680 --> 17:01.559
Come on, you're never
going to like this CD.

17:01.560 --> 17:05.559
You know, you've called me stupid
about three times today,
and I want it to stop.

17:07.280 --> 17:10.719
I bet you couldn't answer
one question about ballet.

17:10.720 --> 17:14.719
Yeah, that's because ballet is lame
and I really couldn't give a fuck.

17:16.119 --> 17:18.479
Ballet is everything to me.

17:18.480 --> 17:21.439
Just like metal is to you.

17:21.440 --> 17:25.439
I'm trying to understand your way,
but you won't let me.

17:25.720 --> 17:28.799
You didn't really like the stuff
Toxic Bob played, did you?

17:28.800 --> 17:30.919
I did like it.

17:30.920 --> 17:34.919
It had counterpoint and melody
and everything else I like in music.

17:35.200 --> 17:38.039
Not that horrible noise you played
me. That was just evil.

17:38.040 --> 17:41.039
Right, well, ballet is just
for gays and grannies.

17:41.040 --> 17:43.839
Stop treating me like an idiot
and help me.

17:43.840 --> 17:46.239
Cos I'm trying to help you, aren't I?

17:46.240 --> 17:48.279
Aren't I?

17:48.280 --> 17:52.279
Oh, suit yourself.

18:29.680 --> 18:33.639
What?So, are you going to do it,
then?

18:33.640 --> 18:37.319
Do what?
It, her, the Angel of Death.

18:37.320 --> 18:41.319
You've had plenty of time to prepare
with Grace. If you don't do it...

18:41.600 --> 18:45.279
What? What...what terrible act
will you visit on my soul?

18:45.280 --> 18:48.039
Gay.
Oh, that's mature

18:48.040 --> 18:49.199
Gay.

18:49.200 --> 18:50.599
So, are you just going to...
Gay.

18:50.600 --> 18:54.599
I'm not...
Gay, gay, gay, gay.

18:55.360 --> 18:58.999
Gay.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.879
? Gay, gay, gay, gay, gay... ?
Yeah, all right, you're a fucking...

19:01.880 --> 19:04.319
Lovely. First thing tomorrow.
Ah...!

19:04.320 --> 19:08.319
Just drop me here.

19:17.920 --> 19:20.559
Shove up.
Sorry, someone's sitting there.

19:20.560 --> 19:23.879
Oh, yeah? Who?

19:23.880 --> 19:26.999
Er...you.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.839
What?
I'm Sub. Short for Sub-Rosa.

19:29.840 --> 19:33.839
Nice to meet you.
Hey, Sub, I'm Rich.

19:59.880 --> 20:03.879
So, what do you do for fun, Rich?

20:05.000 --> 20:08.159
Er...listen to music.

20:08.160 --> 20:10.279
Go to gigs.

20:10.280 --> 20:13.159
Er...hang out with my mate Alo.

20:13.160 --> 20:15.119
That's about it, really.

20:15.120 --> 20:18.839
You don't have any other friends,
just this Alo guy?

20:18.840 --> 20:20.679
Yeah, just him, really.

20:20.680 --> 20:22.599
No-one else?

20:22.600 --> 20:25.679
Well, recently there's been
a couple of other people.

20:25.680 --> 20:28.719
This girl Franky and...

20:28.720 --> 20:30.399
others.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.999
Others?

20:33.000 --> 20:36.639
Yeah...there's this girl

20:36.640 --> 20:40.639
who's helping me, I suppose.

20:41.480 --> 20:45.119
OK, what sort of music
are you into, Sub?

20:45.120 --> 20:48.159
Oh, you know, Industrial, mostly -

20:48.160 --> 20:50.919
Godflesh, early Scorn, TKK.

20:50.920 --> 20:53.959
Nine Inch Nails?
Fuck off.

20:53.960 --> 20:57.959
Trent Reznor can suck my cock.

21:00.040 --> 21:04.039
This girl, then, who's helping you...

21:04.160 --> 21:06.919
...what do you think of her?
Honestly?

21:06.920 --> 21:10.919
Honestly.

21:12.840 --> 21:16.839
She's all right. But... she
lets people walk all over her.

21:18.040 --> 21:22.039
And her friends treat her like
shit, and she doesn't say a word.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.319
Maybe she knows her friends
love her.

21:25.320 --> 21:27.239
Or maybe she's got
no fucking self-respect.

21:27.240 --> 21:28.879
You think you know me, Rich.

21:28.880 --> 21:32.799
No-one fucking knows me.
Not you, not Mini, not Liv.

21:32.800 --> 21:36.239
No-one's got a fucking clue
who I am or what I can do.

21:36.240 --> 21:39.239
So...so, you're Grace now?
Yes, I am Grace,

21:39.240 --> 21:42.959
and I'm not going to let you
talk to me like that.

21:42.960 --> 21:45.279
This is more like it, Grace.
You shouldn't let me trash-talk you.

21:45.280 --> 21:48.079
You shouldn't let anyone trash-talk
you, especially your mates.

21:48.080 --> 21:51.279
It makes me so...fucking angry.

21:51.280 --> 21:53.199
Be angry.
I am angry!

21:53.200 --> 21:56.239
Never compromise.
Never compromise.

21:56.240 --> 21:58.519
Yeah, like this track. "Fuck you,
I won't do what you tell me."

21:58.520 --> 22:00.839
Yeah, fuck you,
I won't do what you tell me.

22:00.840 --> 22:04.479
Fuck you, I won't do
what you tell me.

22:04.480 --> 22:06.599
Fuck you,
I won't do what you tell me!

22:06.600 --> 22:10.599
Fuck you,
I won't do what you tell me!

22:19.200 --> 22:21.559
Motherfucker!

22:48.920 --> 22:51.879
So...

22:51.880 --> 22:55.879
Um...I guess I'm going to ask out
the Angel of Death.

22:56.760 --> 22:58.639
First thing tomorrow.

22:58.640 --> 23:01.039
Oh, right.

23:01.040 --> 23:03.919
Yeah, well, um...

23:03.920 --> 23:07.839
I've, um...got to go.

23:07.840 --> 23:10.999
So, um...I'll see you later.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.999
Yeah.

23:17.560 --> 23:21.559
See you later.F

23:39.880 --> 23:43.359
What would you do, eh, Barney?

23:43.360 --> 23:46.399
Just ask her out, I suppose.

23:47.640 --> 23:49.839
Er...did you
say something, Richard?

23:49.840 --> 23:51.839
No, Kevin.

23:57.600 --> 24:00.639
Listen, you know it's your
mother's birthday tomorrow.

24:00.640 --> 24:01.999
Yeah.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.999
Still, though...

24:05.000 --> 24:06.079
Get her something.

24:06.080 --> 24:09.719
What, with moneyyou'vegiven me?
It seems a bit pointless, doesn't it?

24:09.720 --> 24:11.639
Listen, I know what it's like.

24:11.640 --> 24:13.599
When I was your age,
all I cared about

24:13.600 --> 24:15.279
was getting away from my family,

24:17.760 --> 24:20.439
Yeah? What went wrong?

24:20.440 --> 24:23.999
Bye, Richard.I l...

24:24.000 --> 24:27.999
Don't fucking say it, all right?

24:39.560 --> 24:42.559
Hello. I'm Richard Hardbeck.

24:42.560 --> 24:46.559
How are you?

24:50.840 --> 24:54.839
Um...OK,
so, what sort of music are you into?

24:56.600 --> 25:00.599
What do you like to do for fun?

25:02.320 --> 25:04.399
Look, listen.

25:04.400 --> 25:08.399
Do you...do you want to come out
for a drink with me?

25:08.640 --> 25:09.879
No.

25:16.120 --> 25:17.079
No, actually, why not?

25:17.080 --> 25:18.159
No, actually, why not?
Why not?

25:18.160 --> 25:18.759
Yeah.

25:18.760 --> 25:20.399
Yeah.
Because I'm too pretty for you.

25:20.400 --> 25:22.359
Because you're weird-looking.

25:22.360 --> 25:25.279
Because I can
smell your pants from here.

25:25.280 --> 25:28.679
But mostly because I would rather
rim the shit-smeared arsehole

25:28.680 --> 25:31.919
of a dead horse with AIDS
than even consider the possibility

25:31.920 --> 25:35.199
of touching your wiry,
gangrenous, vile, inadequate,

25:35.200 --> 25:37.519
half-circumcised,
horrifically smelly,

25:37.520 --> 25:41.519
pubescent dick. OK?

25:55.920 --> 25:56.639
Rich. Hey.

25:56.640 --> 25:59.079
Rich. Hey.
Hey.

25:59.080 --> 26:01.199
So, last night was fun.

26:01.200 --> 26:04.399
Er...what? Yeah, yeah. Fun.

26:04.400 --> 26:07.199
I was wondering if, um...

26:07.200 --> 26:10.119
you might like to
do something again some time.

26:10.120 --> 26:11.879
Cos I've got this ballet recital...

26:11.880 --> 26:15.359
No, I can't come tonight.
I've got my gig, haven't I?

26:15.360 --> 26:16.839
OK, well, then maybe...

26:16.840 --> 26:18.839
No, OK? I said no.

26:18.840 --> 26:22.839
All right?

26:27.800 --> 26:31.679
Van. Now.

26:31.680 --> 26:32.959
What?

26:32.960 --> 26:34.839
Explain yourself.

26:39.440 --> 26:42.799
Now you've got something to wank over
when your broadband fails.

26:42.800 --> 26:43.879
What's the problem?

26:43.880 --> 26:47.879
The...the problem is
that I just saw you reject a date

26:47.920 --> 26:50.119
with one of the hottest girls
in college.

26:50.120 --> 26:51.159
She's not hot, OK?

26:51.160 --> 26:54.639
Every other man in the room
would be balls deep...

26:54.640 --> 26:55.279
I'm not every other man.

26:55.280 --> 26:57.359
I'm not every other man.
What's so fucking
special about you? >

26:57.360 --> 26:59.599
Why are you
so different to everyone? >

26:59.600 --> 27:02.639
Cos I don't compromise ever.
I'm metal!

27:05.960 --> 27:07.479
the next thing you'd see

27:07.480 --> 27:10.279
is me body-popping
to Lil Wayne down Oceana.

27:10.280 --> 27:11.319
Mate, listen to me.

27:11.320 --> 27:14.959
Right, you can't just go through
life with all these fucking...

27:14.960 --> 27:17.999
No, how about you listen to me...
for once?

27:22.640 --> 27:24.919
This is Barney. Napalm Death.
He never let anyone

27:29.960 --> 27:32.639
What the fuck does he know?
He spent his life

27:32.640 --> 27:35.919
either sitting on a bus,
masturbating,

27:35.920 --> 27:39.039
or playing unlistenable music
in Swansea!

27:39.040 --> 27:41.839
He ain't got a clue!
Where you going?

27:41.840 --> 27:45.039
To prove you wrong.

27:45.040 --> 27:47.279
Oh, you're full of shit, Rich!

27:47.280 --> 27:50.599
You're just scared! Man the fuck up!

27:58.320 --> 28:01.519
R-Pattz, you dirty,
diggety, double-deal...

28:01.520 --> 28:03.719
Hey, what's up, Rich?

28:03.720 --> 28:05.599
Looking forward to Napalm Death
tonight?

28:05.600 --> 28:06.719
Looking forward to Napalm Death
tonight?
I want it, Bob.

28:06.720 --> 28:07.799
You want what, Bob?

28:07.800 --> 28:08.999
You know what.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.839
Oh, you want it?

28:10.840 --> 28:11.359
Yes.

28:11.360 --> 28:16.079
Yes.
It's 500, boy.

28:16.080 --> 28:20.079
It's all there, huh?

28:34.920 --> 28:36.079
Is it?!

28:36.080 --> 28:40.079
Just a record?

28:44.960 --> 28:48.959
And I saw your copy of Heat,
you fucking sellout!

28:49.800 --> 28:52.239
Some people's children...

28:52.240 --> 28:56.239
Hm.

29:31.360 --> 29:34.279
Bring the noise, motherfucker.

30:56.240 --> 31:00.239
What...what do I do now?

31:02.760 --> 31:06.759
Wait for what?

31:16.400 --> 31:18.319
What do I donow?

35:20.280 --> 35:24.279
I can't hear you.
I've gone deaf.

35:25.320 --> 35:27.599
I've seen a doctor, though.

35:27.600 --> 35:29.639
Should come back soon.

35:30.760 --> 35:33.799
NO SOUND

35:33.800 --> 35:37.799
Listen, Grace...

35:38.200 --> 35:40.479
...I thought that, er...

35:52.680 --> 35:56.679
I thought your dancing
was really beautiful.

36:08.520 --> 36:12.519
I tore up the ticket.

36:59.720 --> 37:01.959
Be careful.

37:01.960 --> 37:03.679
Fuck careful!

37:03.680 --> 37:07.679
Grace.

38:10.760 --> 38:14.759
Fur Elise

38:50.520 --> 38:54.359
? Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the...

38:54.360 --> 38:58.359
? Floor!

39:11.480 --> 39:13.359
Oh, thank fuck.

39:30.320 --> 39:34.319
Cheers, Barney.

40:04.400 --> 40:08.399
Oh, fuck.

40:08.400 --> 40:12.399
Kevin!

40:12.520 --> 40:16.399
Kevin!

40:16.400 --> 40:20.399
Kevin!

40:21.560 --> 40:23.439
Kevin!

40:23.440 --> 40:27.439
I'm in the Wendy house.

40:28.120 --> 40:32.119
I'm out of moisturiser,
so if you and Anita have got...

40:32.520 --> 40:36.519
Oh. Cheers.

40:39.560 --> 40:42.879
Kevin?

40:42.880 --> 40:45.039
Can I ask you something?

40:45.040 --> 40:49.039
Sure.

40:50.160 --> 40:54.159
How did you...

40:54.720 --> 40:57.039
How did you...
How did you ask Mum out?

40:57.040 --> 40:58.679
Ah.

40:58.680 --> 41:01.919
Question about the fairer sex.
Interesting.

41:01.920 --> 41:03.959
Forget it, if you're going to be a
douche.

41:03.960 --> 41:05.759
Um...no, no, no.

41:05.760 --> 41:09.399
Listen...

41:09.400 --> 41:13.399
If there's a girl that you like,
all you have to do is ask.

41:15.520 --> 41:17.759
That's what I did with your mother.

41:17.760 --> 41:21.759
And it was the most frightening
thing I ever did.

41:22.040 --> 41:23.999
You've just got to be brave.

41:24.000 --> 41:27.679
The worst that could happen is,
she says no.

41:27.680 --> 41:28.959
And what then?

41:28.960 --> 41:31.799
Well...you try again...

41:31.800 --> 41:35.799
or you move on.

41:41.800 --> 41:43.639
No problem, son.

41:43.640 --> 41:47.639
See you...Dad.

42:01.840 --> 42:04.319
Is the gay convention in town,
or something?

42:04.320 --> 42:07.239
Where the hell have you been all
day?

42:07.240 --> 42:09.439
Listen, Alo, I...

42:09.440 --> 42:11.479
No, mate. Don't.

42:11.480 --> 42:13.239
I...I just, you know... I...

42:13.240 --> 42:15.759
It's cool, mate.

42:15.760 --> 42:19.759
No worries, yeah?

42:20.920 --> 42:22.119
OK.

42:22.120 --> 42:23.279
OK.

42:23.280 --> 42:26.479
I'm sorry, was that, like,
a conversation you two just had?

42:26.480 --> 42:28.799
That was like an outtake
from Rain Man.

42:28.800 --> 42:31.319
Yeah? I'm Tom Cruise.

42:33.600 --> 42:35.279
Er...have you seen Grace?

42:35.280 --> 42:36.999
Why?

42:37.000 --> 42:39.079
Because...

42:39.080 --> 42:41.159
She's on College Green.

42:41.160 --> 42:43.959
Oh. Er...see you in a bit, yeah?

42:43.960 --> 42:47.719
Yeah, in a bit.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.239
Grace.

43:03.240 --> 43:06.679
Oh. Rich.

43:06.680 --> 43:08.599
Hey, can I, er...talk to you?

43:08.600 --> 43:12.599
Oh, OK.

43:14.760 --> 43:15.999
So, you can hear again?

43:16.000 --> 43:17.399
Er...yeah.

43:17.400 --> 43:20.079
Something must have clicked last
night.

43:20.080 --> 43:21.799
Awesome.

43:21.800 --> 43:25.799
Look, I'm meeting Mini in a minute,
so you need to be quick.

43:28.760 --> 43:32.759
Well, um...

43:32.760 --> 43:34.719
I had a good time last night.

43:34.720 --> 43:37.839
Me too.It was perfect. I loved it.

43:37.840 --> 43:41.839
I would have told you after,
but you were deaf.

43:42.920 --> 43:45.319
You got my text, though?

43:45.320 --> 43:46.519
Yeah.

43:46.520 --> 43:50.519
Oh, right.

43:52.440 --> 43:54.959
Things got pretty close last night,
didn't they?

44:06.640 --> 44:10.319
Er...

44:10.320 --> 44:11.559
Er...

44:11.560 --> 44:13.679
It's probably good...

44:13.680 --> 44:17.439
nothing happened between us.

44:17.440 --> 44:21.279
Right?

44:21.280 --> 44:24.559
Yeah, I...

44:24.560 --> 44:28.559
..guess so.

44:35.960 --> 44:38.999
Who are the flowers for?

44:39.000 --> 44:40.159
My mum.

44:40.160 --> 44:41.479
Really?

44:41.480 --> 44:45.279
No, really.

44:45.280 --> 44:48.159
Right.

44:48.160 --> 44:49.999
Gracie!

44:50.000 --> 44:51.559
I have to go.

44:51.560 --> 44:55.559
I'll, er...see you soon?

44:58.520 --> 44:59.719
Hi, Min. >

44:59.720 --> 45:01.119
Hey, babe.

45:01.120 --> 45:05.119
Hello, Gracie.

45:19.120 --> 45:21.919

wall

45:21.920 --> 45:24.799
? And have you felt your neck skin
crawl

45:28.400 --> 45:32.399
? Sometimes when you're scaredto
take a look at the corner of the room

45:33.720 --> 45:36.879
? You've sensedthat something's
watching you

45:36.880 --> 45:40.879
? Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark

45:51.360 --> 45:54.199
With just two days to go
until our charity fashion show,

45:54.200 --> 45:58.199
Gracie is finally ready
to reveal her designs.

45:58.280 --> 46:02.279
I need two gorgeous models
to walk me and Liv down the runway.

46:04.880 --> 46:07.319
