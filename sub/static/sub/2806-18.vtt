00:03.461 --> 00:05.504
Hey, hey! Guys, you won't believe this!

00:05.672 --> 00:08.507
- I just got off the phone with my agent...
- Oh, my God!

00:10.760 --> 00:12.970
- I'm sorry. Too soon. You go.
- Okay.

00:13.555 --> 00:16.015
I got nominated for my part
on Days of Our Lives!

00:16.181 --> 00:19.143
- Oh, Joey, good for you!
- Congratulations!

00:20.020 --> 00:22.896
- I can't believe you're nominated for an Emmy!
- No, no.

00:23.064 --> 00:26.775
- Soap Opera Digest Award?
- Nope, I'm up for a "Soapie."

00:28.820 --> 00:31.155
Honey, is that something you're making up?

00:31.614 --> 00:36.285
No, no, no, it's real!
And it has been since 1998.

00:37.662 --> 00:39.538
Hey, Rach, Rach. I'm up for a Soapie!

00:40.915 --> 00:41.957
Oh, my God!

00:42.125 --> 00:46.754
Oh, my God! That is the third most
prestigious soap opera award there is!

00:46.963 --> 00:50.758
Thank you! Well, I guess now we know
who I'm taking to the awards.

00:51.009 --> 00:54.219
Oh, stop that! Don't kid about that!
Will all the stars be there?

00:54.387 --> 00:56.889
Many are scheduled to appear.

00:57.557 --> 00:58.599
Oh, my God.

00:58.767 --> 01:02.519
- Oh, my God. I can't go. I'll be too nervous!
- Okay, I'll go.

01:02.687 --> 01:05.564
No! You are getting married.
This is all I have.

01:46.731 --> 01:52.027
And Ernest Muhlbrat first hypothesized
that the velociraptor, when threatened...

01:52.195 --> 01:56.156
...would expand its collar
and emit a high-pitched noise...

01:56.324 --> 01:58.117
...to frighten off its predator.

01:58.576 --> 01:59.618
Yes, Mr. Lewis?

02:00.495 --> 02:02.121
What kind of noise?

02:02.664 --> 02:06.917
Just a high-pitched, intimidating noise.

02:07.460 --> 02:09.377
But like how?

02:09.753 --> 02:12.798
Well, we... We don't know for sure.

02:13.466 --> 02:17.886
But in my head,
it sounded something like this, uh:

02:30.942 --> 02:34.236
Of course, this is just conjecture.

02:36.239 --> 02:38.740
Ahem, okay. That's, uh...
That's all for today.

02:40.285 --> 02:43.245
Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment?

02:46.291 --> 02:47.457
Yes, sir?

02:47.625 --> 02:51.795
Mr. Morse, I need to talk to you
about your midterm exam.

02:52.213 --> 02:55.966
- I'm afraid I had to fail you.
- Why?

02:56.843 --> 02:59.178
Well, you need 60 percent to pass.

02:59.345 --> 03:01.638
- What'd I get?
- Seven.

03:02.724 --> 03:05.184
That's not so good.

03:05.768 --> 03:08.854
No, no, it's not. What happened there, Ned?

03:09.397 --> 03:14.735
Well, maybe you can cut me some slack.
I'm sort of in love.

03:15.069 --> 03:18.238
I'm sorry, but that's really not my problem.

03:18.656 --> 03:20.073
I'm in love with you.

03:22.452 --> 03:25.537
Well, that brings me in the loop a little.

03:26.080 --> 03:30.667
See, that's why I did so bad on this test.
I'm having a hard time concentrating.

03:30.835 --> 03:33.587
When you're up there and you're teaching...

03:33.755 --> 03:36.632
...and your face gets all serious...

03:36.799 --> 03:41.762
...you look so good. When you wear
that tight little turtleneck sweater...

03:41.930 --> 03:44.681
Okay. Ned, um...

03:44.849 --> 03:48.936
I, uh... Ha, ha.
I'm your teacher. I'm sorry.

03:49.103 --> 03:50.854
You're... You're a student.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.273
And I... And I like women, ha, ha.

03:53.441 --> 03:56.777
In spite of what may be written
on the backs of some of these chairs.

04:01.658 --> 04:02.699
Oh, my God.

04:02.867 --> 04:05.327
That guy at the counter
is totally checking you out.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.496
Really?

04:07.664 --> 04:11.291
- Oh, my God, he's really cute.
- Heh. Go for it.

04:12.210 --> 04:13.961
Phoebe, I'm engaged.

04:14.128 --> 04:16.797
I'm just saying, get his number,
just in case.

04:18.257 --> 04:22.469
But if Chandler is in an accident
and can't perform sexually, you know...

04:22.720 --> 04:27.724
...then he would want you to take a lover
to satisfy the needs he can no longer fulfill.

04:30.561 --> 04:31.853
- Hi. I...
- Oh.

04:33.231 --> 04:34.856
Can I just tell you something? Um...

04:35.024 --> 04:38.819
I'm very flattered,
but, uh, I'm engaged. Ha, ha.

04:39.237 --> 04:42.197
Wow, uh... This is kind of embarrassing.

04:42.365 --> 04:45.075
I was actually coming over
to talk to your friend.

04:47.745 --> 04:49.705
Well, you should be embarrassed.

04:53.251 --> 04:58.005
- I thought you knew I was looking at you.
- I did, but that was really fun.

05:00.008 --> 05:02.384
"The winner is Joey Tribbiani!"

05:07.473 --> 05:09.683
"Oh, wow.

05:09.851 --> 05:12.561
I honestly never expected this. I, uh...

05:12.729 --> 05:14.604
I didn't prepare a speech.

05:14.772 --> 05:19.151
But I'd like to thank my parents,
who've always been there for me.

05:19.319 --> 05:24.448
Also like to thank my friends,
Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel..."

05:24.615 --> 05:26.658
- I'm fourth?
- Jeez!

05:28.494 --> 05:31.204
Look at you with your
little maple syrup award!

05:31.372 --> 05:33.290
Maybe you don't tell anyone
about this.

05:33.458 --> 05:34.666
What? No.

05:34.834 --> 05:37.836
It's not a big deal.
I do that too, with my shampoo bottle.

05:38.004 --> 05:39.046
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:39.213 --> 05:42.174
- What award are you practicing for?
- Grammy.

05:43.801 --> 05:46.553
- Best New Artist.
- Ooh.

05:46.929 --> 05:50.766
Oh, hey, listen. The Soapies people called
today. I also get to present an award.

05:50.933 --> 05:52.392
- Aw, that's great.
- Yeah.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.853
So you'll get on stage even if you don't win.

05:58.441 --> 06:01.193
- You... You don't think I'm gonna win?
- Of course I do.

06:01.402 --> 06:02.486
Oh.

06:02.653 --> 06:06.531
But, you know, Favorite Returning Character
is a tough category, Joey.

06:06.699 --> 06:10.369
I mean, you're up against the guy
who survived his own cremation.

06:10.703 --> 06:14.831
Yeah. No, I know I might not win.
But it's just...

06:14.999 --> 06:18.001
I've never even been nominated before.
I want it so much.

06:18.169 --> 06:19.711
Well, and you'll probably get it.

06:19.962 --> 06:23.715
But you should probably start practicing
your "gracious-loser" face.

06:23.883 --> 06:27.177
Like, when the cameras are on you
and you wanna look disappointed...

06:27.345 --> 06:30.305
...but also that your colleague
deserved to win. Sort of like:

06:36.062 --> 06:37.145
- Hey.
- You know?

06:37.313 --> 06:41.942
- You practice losing at the Grammys too?
- Oh, no, at the Grammys, I always win.

06:42.110 --> 06:43.693
Ah.

06:48.491 --> 06:51.034
- Oh, hey.
- Hey. How'd your date go with Jake?

06:51.202 --> 06:53.870
Great. We couldn't keep our eyes
off each other all night.

06:54.038 --> 06:59.292
Then every once in a while, he'd lean over
and stroke my hair, and then touch my neck.

06:59.460 --> 07:01.503
Okay, stop it. You're getting me all tingly.

07:03.131 --> 07:06.216
All I could think of was,
"Is he gonna kiss me? Is he?"

07:06.384 --> 07:09.136
- And did he?
- I'm a lady, Monica. I don't kiss and tell.

07:09.303 --> 07:11.638
But this hickey speaks for itself.

07:11.806 --> 07:13.849
Okay, okay, I got it. I got it.

07:14.267 --> 07:17.853
I just like him so much that
I just feel like I've had 10 drinks today.

07:18.020 --> 07:19.938
And I've only had six.

07:21.399 --> 07:26.570
Oh. You know, I haven't had that feeling
since I first starting going out with Chandler.

07:26.863 --> 07:31.283
- Wow, I'm never gonna have that feeling again.
- You sound like a guy.

07:31.451 --> 07:35.495
Heh. No, a guy would say, "I'm never gonna
get to sleep with anyone else." Heh.

07:35.663 --> 07:38.165
Oh, my God.
I'm never gonna sleep with anyone else!

07:39.667 --> 07:43.753
I've been so busy planning the wedding,
I forgot about all the things I'd be giving up.

07:43.921 --> 07:47.924
I mean, I'm never gonna
have a first kiss again.

07:48.217 --> 07:50.302
You'll have a last kiss.

07:55.683 --> 07:59.102
Can I ask you something? You ever
had a guy have a crush on you?

07:59.270 --> 08:01.313
Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?

08:03.316 --> 08:06.818
There's this kid in my class
who said he's in love with me.

08:06.986 --> 08:08.069
- Whoa!
- Yeah.

08:08.237 --> 08:10.780
- Whoa, what?
- Ross has a boyfriend.

08:11.657 --> 08:13.700
I do... I do not have a boyfriend.

08:13.868 --> 08:17.913
There's a guy in one of my classes
who has a crush on me.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.706
- Really?
- Yeah. I don't know.

08:19.874 --> 08:22.584
I mean, last year, Elizabeth, now this kid...

08:22.752 --> 08:26.588
What... What... What is it?
Am I giving out some kind of...

08:26.756 --> 08:29.341
...a sexy-professor vibe?

08:32.260 --> 08:33.970
Not right now.

08:34.429 --> 08:39.601
The point is, my natural charisma
has made him fail his midterm.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.852
Aw, see now I feel bad for the kid.

08:42.020 --> 08:45.315
I had a crush on a teacher once,
and it was so hard, you know.

08:45.483 --> 08:49.986
I couldn't concentrate and
I blushed every time he looked at me.

08:50.154 --> 08:53.240
Come on, you remember what it's like
to be 19 and in love.

08:55.034 --> 08:58.453
- Yeah, guess I can cut him some slack.
- Yeah.

08:58.621 --> 09:01.665
- How'd you get over that teacher?
- I didn't.

09:01.832 --> 09:04.000
I got under him.

09:05.461 --> 09:06.711
Problem solved.

09:10.424 --> 09:12.801
- Bye, Phoebe.
- Okay, bye.

09:18.182 --> 09:22.060
- All right. Bye.
- Bye.

09:27.567 --> 09:31.361
We said goodbye at the door
so as not to flaunt our new love.

09:31.821 --> 09:34.447
Phoebe, it's okay.
You don't have to tiptoe around me.

09:34.615 --> 09:37.951
I've been thinking about it, and um...
You know what?

09:38.119 --> 09:40.787
I'm okay about not having
that new-relationship feeling.

09:41.247 --> 09:44.749
- I miss you already!
- I miss you too!

09:48.296 --> 09:52.591
See, that's what I mean. That's great,
but I wouldn't trade in what I have for that.

09:52.758 --> 09:55.719
I mean, I'm gonna be with Chandler
for the rest of my life.

09:55.886 --> 09:57.846
- That's what makes me happy.
- Mm-hm.

09:58.014 --> 10:02.726
Hey, sweetie, come here, sit down. We
were talking about how our relationship is...

10:02.893 --> 10:05.478
...deep and meaningful.
It really is, don't you think?

10:05.646 --> 10:06.980
Oh, totally.

10:08.232 --> 10:09.274
Pull my finger.

10:15.239 --> 10:18.450
Presenting the award
for Favorite Returning Male...

10:18.618 --> 10:20.493
This is it. This is my category!

10:20.745 --> 10:22.245
- Got your speech?
- Got my speech.

10:22.413 --> 10:24.039
- Got your gracious-loser face?
- Yep.

10:26.876 --> 10:29.252
Now, Joey, remember,
if you win, you have to hug me.

10:29.420 --> 10:32.047
Okay. Can I squeeze your ass?

10:33.549 --> 10:35.133
- On TV?
- Yeah.

10:35.301 --> 10:37.302
- Yeah.
- Okay.

10:37.678 --> 10:41.014
In the category of Favorite Returning
Male Character, the nominees are:

10:41.223 --> 10:43.141
John Wheeler from General Hospital.

10:45.770 --> 10:49.481
Gavin Graham from
The Young and the Restless.

10:49.774 --> 10:53.276
Duncan Harrington from Passions.

10:53.444 --> 10:57.405
And Joey Tribbiani
from Days of Our Lives.

10:58.407 --> 11:01.326
And the Soapie goes to:

11:02.745 --> 11:04.913
Gavin Graham from
The Young and the Restless.

11:17.968 --> 11:20.553
Presenting
the Favorite Supporting Actress award:

11:20.721 --> 11:23.223
Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives.

11:30.398 --> 11:34.526
Any one of the brilliant actresses
nominated for this award tonight...

11:34.777 --> 11:38.321
...deserves to take it home.
Unfortunately, only one can.

11:41.617 --> 11:44.077
The nominees for
Favorite Supporting Actress are:

11:44.245 --> 11:46.913
From Passions, Erin Goff.

11:51.210 --> 11:53.378
From One Life to Live,
Mary Lauren Bishop.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.797
From All My Children, Sarah Renee.

11:55.965 --> 11:58.967
And from Days of Our Lives,
Jessica Ashley.

11:59.135 --> 12:01.428
And the winner is:

12:02.012 --> 12:04.264
Jessica Ashley from Days of Our Lives.

12:05.975 --> 12:08.852
Uh, unfortunately, Jessica
couldn't be with us tonight...

12:09.019 --> 12:12.814
...so I'll be accepting this award
on her behalf.

12:16.402 --> 12:19.362
And I'm sure that Jessica...

12:19.530 --> 12:21.614
...would like to thank my parents...

12:21.782 --> 12:23.867
...who always believed in me.

12:24.034 --> 12:26.369
And she'd also like to thank my friends:

12:26.537 --> 12:30.915
Chandler, Monica, Ross,
Phoebe and Rachel...

12:31.083 --> 12:33.251
...who's sitting right there.

12:44.680 --> 12:47.640
Joey, why did we have to
rush out of there so fast?

12:47.892 --> 12:49.851
We had to get out of there because...

12:50.019 --> 12:52.187
Look what I won! Ha-ha-ha.

12:53.814 --> 12:57.233
Oh, my God. You stole her award.

12:57.401 --> 13:01.029
No, no, no.
I'm accepting it on her behalf.

13:02.406 --> 13:04.616
I don't think you know what "behalf" means.

13:04.867 --> 13:08.953
Sure I do. It's a verb. As in "I be half-in' it"!

13:10.414 --> 13:12.081
Joey...

13:13.083 --> 13:17.587
- You have got to take this back.
- Why? I should've won one. I really wanted it.

13:17.755 --> 13:22.258
She didn't even care enough to come
to the thing. It could also be a Grammy.

13:26.096 --> 13:27.138
No, Joey.

13:27.306 --> 13:31.142
Come on, Rach. No one saw me take it.
There was a whole table full of them.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.853
Do you really want an award
that you didn't win?

13:34.021 --> 13:37.816
No, I want an award I did win.
But nobody's given me any of those!

13:39.360 --> 13:43.238
Plus, look, hey, Rach. If I put it up,
when people come over, they'll see it...

13:43.447 --> 13:44.989
...and they'll think I won it.

13:45.157 --> 13:48.034
Joey, it says "Best Supporting Actress."

13:48.744 --> 13:50.703
I can scratch that right off.

13:51.872 --> 13:54.290
Joey, no, this is wrong.
You have to take it back.

13:54.458 --> 13:59.462
Okay? You don't wanna win an award
this way. You're very talented.

13:59.630 --> 14:04.509
And someday you're gonna win one of these
for real and that one is gonna mean something.

14:07.012 --> 14:09.639
- Oh, all right.
- All right? Thank you.

14:11.058 --> 14:14.185
- I'll take it back tomorrow.
- Thank you.

14:25.281 --> 14:27.991
- If I can't have it, you can't have it!
- Aah!

14:34.456 --> 14:38.501
- Professor Geller?
- Yes, Mr. Lewis? How can I help you?

14:38.669 --> 14:41.754
I know I didn't do well
on my midterms and stuff...

14:41.922 --> 14:45.466
...but I was kind of hoping
you could change my grade.

14:45.634 --> 14:48.136
And why exactly would I do that?

14:48.888 --> 14:50.513
Because I'm in love with you.

14:53.309 --> 14:55.059
What?

14:55.436 --> 14:59.188
Yeah. I'm all in love with you and stuff.

15:01.400 --> 15:04.861
- So could you change my grade?
- No!

15:05.195 --> 15:07.280
Well, why not? You changed Ned's grade.

15:07.448 --> 15:11.618
Well, that's different, okay?
Because he was actually in love with me.

15:11.785 --> 15:15.038
No, he's not!
He's totally yanking your chain.

15:15.205 --> 15:17.665
He's done this with three other teachers.

15:19.543 --> 15:21.711
- What?
- He's got a girlfriend.

15:23.464 --> 15:26.549
I can't believe someone
would do that for a grade.

15:26.717 --> 15:28.092
I know.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.510
It's awful.

15:31.597 --> 15:32.722
I love you.

15:36.894 --> 15:38.811
- Have you seen Chandler?
- No, why?

15:38.979 --> 15:42.190
I just keep thinking about
all these things I'm not gonna have...

15:42.358 --> 15:45.234
...and it's freaking me out.
I don't know what to do about it.

15:45.402 --> 15:46.778
Okay. Don't sweat it.

15:46.946 --> 15:51.574
Chandler is nowhere around, so get it
out of your system. That guy's cute.

15:53.243 --> 15:54.911
Phoebe, come on, I'm serious.

15:56.580 --> 16:00.541
- I've just gotta talk to him about all this.
- That is the last thing you wanna do.

16:01.001 --> 16:04.545
- Why?
- Because you're marrying him!

16:05.214 --> 16:07.548
You gotta help me out here, Pheebs.

16:07.716 --> 16:11.094
All right, I've never been engaged
and I've never really been married.

16:11.261 --> 16:13.930
But I can only tell you
what my mother told me.

16:14.098 --> 16:18.351
Whenever you have doubts or fears
or anxieties about a relationship...

16:18.519 --> 16:21.270
...do not communicate them
to your husband.

16:22.940 --> 16:26.609
So I'm not supposed to share
my doubts and fears...

16:26.777 --> 16:29.278
...with the guy I'm spending
the rest of my life with?

16:29.446 --> 16:31.572
That is correct. Yes.

16:31.740 --> 16:35.284
You're supposed to put all that stuff
in a little box in your mind...

16:35.452 --> 16:37.203
...and then lock it up tight.

16:38.122 --> 16:39.956
- Your mother told you this?
- Yes.

16:40.374 --> 16:44.085
The woman that got married a bunch of times
and killed herself when you were 13?

16:46.005 --> 16:47.588
Oh, my God, you're right.

16:47.756 --> 16:50.758
All right, go. Go tell Chandler.
Hurry, before it's too late!

16:50.926 --> 16:55.596
Wait, no! Does this also mean
that putting out doesn't get you love?

17:01.020 --> 17:04.480
- I can't believe I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley!
- Wait, wait.

17:04.647 --> 17:07.858
Please be cool, okay?
I work with this woman.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.028
- Okay, I'm totally cool.
- Okay.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.530
Come in.

17:13.656 --> 17:14.781
Hey, Jessica.

17:14.950 --> 17:16.867
Hey, Jess.

17:17.453 --> 17:18.618
This is my friend Rachel.

17:18.829 --> 17:21.372
- Hi.
- What's up?

17:24.460 --> 17:27.377
Uh, listen, here's your Soapie.
I accepted it for you.

17:27.546 --> 17:31.549
Oh, my God. I won?
Do you have any idea what this means?

17:34.762 --> 17:38.139
That's it. You're not gonna put it
on your shelf or anything?

17:38.307 --> 17:43.227
No, I try to save that for real awards.
Now if you'll excuse me?

17:44.688 --> 17:45.730
Hm!

17:45.898 --> 17:47.106
- Take it back?
- Absolutely.

17:47.274 --> 17:48.608
Yep.

17:52.988 --> 17:55.114
Yeah, you do.

17:57.409 --> 18:00.495
- Honey? As we get closer to the wedding...
- Hm?

18:00.662 --> 18:03.247
...is there anything you'd like to
talk about or share?

18:03.499 --> 18:07.418
Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces
are too big.

18:07.586 --> 18:09.837
You're wrong. The centerpieces are fine.

18:12.758 --> 18:16.094
- Do you ever get scared at all?
- Kind of. They're really big.

18:17.971 --> 18:23.226
Doesn't it ever freak you out that you're
never gonna be with anybody new again?

18:23.894 --> 18:25.061
What?

18:25.562 --> 18:26.604
Just...

18:26.772 --> 18:29.398
I love you so much. Just...

18:29.566 --> 18:33.277
It's just sometimes it bothers me
that I'm never gonna have that feeling.

18:33.445 --> 18:35.738
When you first meet someone
for the first time...

18:35.906 --> 18:39.450
...and it's new and exciting.
You know that rush?

18:40.035 --> 18:41.536
No.

18:42.454 --> 18:44.247
No, see, when I first meet somebody...

18:44.414 --> 18:49.669
...it's mostly panic, anxiety
and a great deal of sweating.

18:51.213 --> 18:53.256
Okay, but... All right, you're a guy.

18:53.423 --> 18:57.426
Does it not freak you out that you're
never gonna sleep with anybody else?

18:57.761 --> 19:00.138
Sleeping with somebody, no.

19:00.305 --> 19:04.433
Anxiety, panic and
I'm afraid even more sweating.

19:05.769 --> 19:06.978
Even with me?

19:07.146 --> 19:11.399
I was dangerously dehydrated during
the first six months of our relationship.

19:13.152 --> 19:18.322
Look, for me the rush is knowing that we
are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.

19:19.533 --> 19:21.742
- Really?
- Well, yeah.

19:21.910 --> 19:27.248
Knowing you're having these thoughts,
we're back to panic, anxiety and, uh...

19:27.416 --> 19:30.293
...I'm definitely gonna need
some kind of sports drink.

19:31.211 --> 19:32.461
Come here.

19:32.629 --> 19:36.215
Come here.
Oh, sweetie, you don't have to worry.

19:36.550 --> 19:41.137
No. Besides, you know what?
I'm gonna have a lot of new things with you.

19:41.305 --> 19:45.850
The first time we buy a house,
our first kid, our first grandkid.

19:46.059 --> 19:48.477
Water. Water. Water.

19:50.480 --> 19:53.441
Uh, Mr. Morse?
Can I speak to you for a moment?

19:56.320 --> 19:59.363
That was a great lecture today.

19:59.531 --> 20:00.823
- Did you get a haircut?
- Mm-hm.

20:00.991 --> 20:04.619
Yeah, yeah. Do you like it?
Do you love it?

20:06.371 --> 20:09.040
I want you to know that
I'm changing your grade back.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.667
What? Why?

20:11.960 --> 20:15.588
Because I know what you're trying
to pull here. It's not gonna work.

20:15.756 --> 20:20.426
I'm not trying to pull anything.
Look, I love you, dude.

20:21.220 --> 20:25.431
You know what, I'm not even gonna talk
about this. This little "thing" is over.

20:25.599 --> 20:30.561
I know you have a girlfriend. Yeah.
And I know about the other professors.

20:30.729 --> 20:34.357
How do you think that makes me feel, Ned?
You used me!

20:34.524 --> 20:36.817
You don't love me and you never did!

20:40.113 --> 20:42.740
Ah, Professor Winston.
Professor Frederickson.

20:44.993 --> 20:47.286
I'll be right with you.

20:47.454 --> 20:50.498
Don't make this worse
and I'll give you a C. Shall we?

20:57.047 --> 20:58.089
Rach?

20:58.257 --> 21:01.509
- I'll be out in a second.
- Hm.

21:05.806 --> 21:07.890
"It's just so unexpected! I...

21:08.058 --> 21:09.725
Ha-ha-ha.

21:10.519 --> 21:14.730
I'll tell you, it's just such an honor
to just be nominated...

21:14.898 --> 21:17.817
...for a Nobel Prize.

21:18.568 --> 21:23.572
And, you know, to win one
for a massage! Oh...

21:23.740 --> 21:27.660
Especially after having just won
a Tony Award for Best Actress..."

21:27.828 --> 21:29.745
We have to go.
Our reservations are at 8.

21:29.913 --> 21:33.499
"...in Reservations at Eight
by Neil Simon.

21:33.709 --> 21:37.545
Thank you, Neil.
Thank you for the words."

21:38.088 --> 21:40.840
You can finish this later.
We're gonna be late. We gotta go.

21:41.008 --> 21:43.342
Please don't play the music.
Just one more thing.

21:43.510 --> 21:44.552
Okay.

21:44.720 --> 21:48.681
"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!"
