00:32.479 --> 00:34.348
STEVE:
<i>Radishes are looking healthy.</i>

00:34.382 --> 00:38.585
Strawberries have their seeds
on the <i>outside.</i> That's good.

00:38.620 --> 00:40.787
Zucchini
appropriately phallic...

00:40.822 --> 00:43.323
inducing slight feelings
of inadequacy.

00:43.358 --> 00:45.993
What the...! These tomatoes
are mired in the dirt!

00:46.027 --> 00:48.195
They're-they're in danger
of getting ground rot!

00:48.229 --> 00:49.696
They look okay to me.

00:49.731 --> 00:52.266
The day "okay" is good enough
for this garden club

00:52.300 --> 00:54.668
is the day I resign
as its president!

00:54.702 --> 00:56.303
We're co-presidents, Steve.

00:56.337 --> 00:58.138
Then start acting like it!

00:58.172 --> 01:00.107
Oh, what nice tomatoes.

01:00.141 --> 01:02.542
No, Mom, they're <i>not.</i>

01:02.577 --> 01:04.544
(quietly):
What are you doing here?

01:04.578 --> 01:07.414
You're making me look uncool
in front of the garden club!

01:07.448 --> 01:10.183
Gardening? Steve, that's
one of my four things!

01:10.218 --> 01:13.520
And you and I haven't really done
anything together in a while.

01:13.554 --> 01:15.856
Can I join? Gardening
is about creating

01:15.890 --> 01:18.825
something from nothing
and watching it grow.

01:18.860 --> 01:21.595
What would you know
about <i>that,</i> Mother?

01:21.629 --> 01:22.930
Pfft!

01:22.964 --> 01:24.665
<i>Anyway...</i>

01:24.699 --> 01:27.401
if we intend to have
gazpacho for Arbor Day,

01:27.435 --> 01:29.603
we're gonna need
a tomato cage, stat.

01:29.637 --> 01:31.371
To the gardening store!

01:31.406 --> 01:33.607
Ooh, maybe I could drive you.

01:34.642 --> 01:36.877
We could play car bingo!

01:36.911 --> 01:39.279
I'll let you smoke!

01:39.314 --> 01:41.515
(finishing lively song)

01:41.549 --> 01:43.350
I got to say,
I'm all a-tither

01:43.384 --> 01:45.519
for our big performance.
I know, right?

01:45.553 --> 01:48.355
Russian balalaika trios
are gonna be the next big thing,

01:48.389 --> 01:51.291
and we'll be at the forefront,
raking in the rubles.

01:51.326 --> 01:52.859
Then where's our audience?

01:52.894 --> 01:54.494
Relax. People will show.

01:54.529 --> 01:56.463
I mean, we're the only
game in town, right?

01:56.497 --> 01:59.866
I mean, it's not like there's anyone else
in Langley Falls working their asses off

01:59.901 --> 02:03.870
to keep alive the orchestral folk
traditions of tsarist Russia!

02:03.905 --> 02:07.174
Just made my own sandwich
for the first time.

02:07.208 --> 02:09.476
Awful. Just awful.

02:09.509 --> 02:10.711
Mm. Mm.

02:10.745 --> 02:12.312
Oh, oh, oh, God.

02:12.347 --> 02:13.747
(sighs)

02:13.781 --> 02:15.115
What's your drama, Mama?

02:15.149 --> 02:17.985
Steve doesn't want anything
to do with me anymore.

02:18.019 --> 02:20.320
We used to have
so much in common,

02:20.355 --> 02:22.789
but now... Oh, it's all
perfectly natural.

02:22.824 --> 02:25.926
Steve is becoming a man,
and one aspect of being a man

02:25.960 --> 02:28.195
is having absolutely
no interest in women.

02:28.229 --> 02:30.030
(groans) I suppose
you're right.

02:30.064 --> 02:32.332
Of course I'm right--
because I'm a man.

02:32.367 --> 02:33.767
A man, Francine.

02:33.801 --> 02:35.802
From my head down
to my low-hanging...

02:35.837 --> 02:38.805
(amplified heartbeat)

02:38.840 --> 02:40.807
(quiet crunching)

02:40.842 --> 02:42.376
Ooh!

02:42.410 --> 02:44.811
Stan! Are you okay?

02:44.846 --> 02:47.414
(siren wailing)

02:47.448 --> 02:50.317
(whistles) This is
some thick-ass gauge wire.

02:50.351 --> 02:51.718
We're buying it.

02:51.753 --> 02:53.220
Barry, hand over the money.

02:53.254 --> 02:54.621
I don't have any money.

02:54.655 --> 02:56.056
But you're the treasurer.

02:56.090 --> 02:58.759
We-we gave you all
of our club funds to manage.

02:58.793 --> 03:02.562
I spent it all on dance moves!

03:02.597 --> 03:04.231
Jealous?

03:04.265 --> 03:05.832
A little.

03:05.867 --> 03:07.367
(sighing):
Aw, great.

03:07.402 --> 03:09.469
Well, we need this cage.

03:09.504 --> 03:13.206
So I guess we have no choice
but to steal it.

03:17.345 --> 03:20.847
Okay, so Toshi's in,
I'm in. You guys in?

03:21.883 --> 03:24.518
Okay, but how
are we gonna do it?

03:24.552 --> 03:27.220
(fierce yelling)

03:31.859 --> 03:33.860
That was awesome!

03:33.895 --> 03:36.196
What a rush!
I'm shaking.

03:36.230 --> 03:37.898
<i>I</i> want to rip something off!

03:37.932 --> 03:39.232
No, me!

03:39.267 --> 03:40.500
In time, fellows.

03:40.535 --> 03:41.935
But you're just beginners,

03:41.969 --> 03:44.905
so we need to find a place
that's easy to steal from.

03:44.939 --> 03:46.273
Hmm...

03:51.079 --> 03:52.879
I don't get it.

03:52.914 --> 03:54.114
Why didn't people come?

03:54.148 --> 03:56.450
We had 45 maybes on our Evites.

03:56.484 --> 03:58.318
Hayley, "maybe" means no.

03:58.352 --> 04:01.121
The only place that
"maybe" means maybe is sex.

04:01.155 --> 04:02.989
Maybe.

04:05.660 --> 04:07.060
Okay, I'll bite.

04:07.095 --> 04:09.262
What's up with the
gyroscope on his junk?

04:09.297 --> 04:11.498
Stan was... injured

04:11.532 --> 04:14.334
and went into a rare
condition known as...

04:14.368 --> 04:17.003
"testicular
retreat syndrome."

04:17.038 --> 04:20.273
His, um... nuggs
were so traumatized,

04:20.308 --> 04:23.076
they ran up into
his body to heal.

04:23.111 --> 04:24.878
What? Will he be okay?

04:24.912 --> 04:26.313
We don't know yet.

04:26.347 --> 04:28.415
They might drop down
again someday,

04:28.449 --> 04:31.084
but the doctors say
there's a good chance

04:31.119 --> 04:33.186
they'll just die up there,

04:33.221 --> 04:36.189
like a gut-torn rabbit
in a wooded thicket.

04:36.224 --> 04:37.991
Wait, hold on a second.
I'm confused.

04:38.025 --> 04:40.827
Why the hell didn't you dicks show
up to our balalaika concert?!

04:40.862 --> 04:43.163
(high-pitched): I've got
bigger problems right now

04:43.197 --> 04:46.133
than supporting
your commie music!

04:46.167 --> 04:47.467
(both laughing)

04:47.502 --> 04:49.936
Stop! So what if I sound
a little feminine?

04:49.971 --> 04:52.739
Stop laughing and treat me
with the respect I deserve!

04:52.773 --> 04:54.407
(both laughing)

04:54.442 --> 04:56.176
My voice is not that...

04:56.210 --> 04:57.577
(dogs barking in distance)

04:57.612 --> 04:59.079
...not <i>that</i> high.

04:59.113 --> 05:00.380
(barking continues)

05:00.414 --> 05:02.015
It's a little higher
than usual.

05:02.049 --> 05:04.584
(dogs barking,
banging against door)

05:09.223 --> 05:12.192
And that, Mr. Baby,
is why I vastly prefer

05:12.226 --> 05:15.762
a good round of marbles to
these confounded video games.

05:15.796 --> 05:18.698
Back in my day,
all we had to have fun

05:18.733 --> 05:21.334
was sleepy hobos and fire ants.

05:23.871 --> 05:26.039
Well, thanks for
the trip down memory lane,

05:26.073 --> 05:30.177
but there's a can outside,
and it's not gonna kick itself.

05:33.481 --> 05:35.282
(jail cell door slamming shut)

05:35.316 --> 05:36.783
Hold it right there, son.

05:36.817 --> 05:39.286
Abort! Abort!

05:39.320 --> 05:41.555
What's in your pocket there?

05:43.024 --> 05:45.192
And how about
your other pocket?

05:47.895 --> 05:50.197
I-I'm in a gardening club!

05:52.733 --> 05:54.701
(groans) There, there, sweetie.

05:54.735 --> 05:56.436
Hey, Stan, want me
to horse whisper

05:56.470 --> 05:57.938
those bad boys out of there?

05:57.972 --> 06:00.140
(whispering inaudibly)

06:03.411 --> 06:04.978
Wh-What did they say?

06:05.012 --> 06:06.213
It's no use.

06:06.247 --> 06:08.048
There's no talking
sense into them...

06:08.082 --> 06:09.349
'cause they're nuts!

06:09.383 --> 06:12.385
♪
Aah! Thank you! Aah! Ha-ha!

06:13.721 --> 06:15.889
Dad, things'll turn out okay.

06:15.923 --> 06:19.125
<i>Jawohl.</i> I lost my testes
when I became a fish.

06:19.160 --> 06:21.428
But being a fish isn't all bad.

06:21.462 --> 06:24.631
Now I can write inspirational
messages in the water.

06:27.235 --> 06:29.035
No! I'm a freak!

06:29.070 --> 06:31.404
Until my boys drop
and my voice returns,

06:31.439 --> 06:33.873
I vow you'll never
hear me speak again!

What? Oh, no!

06:41.949 --> 06:43.950

06:51.726 --> 06:54.661
Ha! Yeah!

06:56.364 --> 06:59.499
Thank you for letting Steve off
with just a warning, Mr. Baby.

06:59.533 --> 07:02.335
Well, you're lucky I'm just
a mom-and-pop operation.

07:02.370 --> 07:04.771
Technically,
just a pop operation,

07:04.805 --> 07:07.107
since the woman
I share my bed with

07:07.141 --> 07:09.809
is not the mother
of my children,

07:09.844 --> 07:13.947
but a toothless candy whore
who I pay in Razzles.

07:13.981 --> 07:15.448
But the bigger corporate stores

07:15.483 --> 07:17.284
won't be so forgiving
with your boy.

07:17.318 --> 07:19.286
Oh, don't you worry.

07:19.320 --> 07:22.188
Steve <i>will</i> learn his lesson.

07:22.223 --> 07:25.258
Yo, Julian, where my Razzles?!

Damn it, woman, why
won't you yell at me?!

07:33.434 --> 07:36.136
And what are we doing
in your bedroom?

07:36.170 --> 07:37.570
Oh, God!

07:37.605 --> 07:39.572
You're gonna lock me
in your closet!

the Blouse Monster lives!

What is this stuff?

07:51.185 --> 07:55.088
Ah, just a lot of things
I've stolen over the years...

07:55.122 --> 07:57.424
<i>successfully.</i>
What?!

07:57.458 --> 07:58.958
Don't you get it, Steve?

07:58.993 --> 08:01.161
I'm not angry at you
for stealing.

08:01.195 --> 08:03.830
I'm angry that you got caught!

08:03.864 --> 08:05.832
Aah! Blouse Monster!

I don't understand.

08:12.791 --> 08:13.791
You're telling me

08:13.825 --> 08:15.202
you shoplifted all this stuff?

08:15.256 --> 08:16.623
And unlike you,

08:16.658 --> 08:19.559
I haven't gotten
caught in 20 years.

08:19.594 --> 08:22.095
Wow, look at all
these treasures.

08:23.131 --> 08:25.198
A ream of printer paper,

08:25.233 --> 08:27.034
a VHS tape rewinder,

08:27.068 --> 08:28.702
a four-pack of paint rollers.

08:28.736 --> 08:31.872
Huh, this all looked a lot more
impressive on first glance.

08:31.906 --> 08:34.041
That's 'cause I give 'em all
a regular spritz

08:34.075 --> 08:35.509
with this Sparkle Spray.

08:37.445 --> 08:38.712
It's so beautiful.

08:38.746 --> 08:40.514
This is all so...

08:40.548 --> 08:41.847
badass!

08:41.883 --> 08:44.351
I thought you were
a typical, lame mom,

08:44.385 --> 08:46.453
but it turns out
you're a hard-core criminal?

08:46.487 --> 08:49.256
A criminal is someone
who gets caught, Steve.

08:49.290 --> 08:50.791
We're artists.

08:50.825 --> 08:52.392
We?
That's right.

08:52.427 --> 08:53.960
You're my son.

08:53.995 --> 08:56.663
And from now on,
when my son steals,

08:56.698 --> 08:58.565
he's gonna know how
to get away with it.

dream of this moment?

09:11.713 --> 09:13.380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's do this!

10:29.657 --> 10:30.924
Of course they do!

10:30.958 --> 10:32.259
The entire second verse

10:32.293 --> 10:33.527
you were plucking
instead of plinking!

10:33.561 --> 10:34.795
Don't you start, fish!

10:34.829 --> 10:37.063
You play that gusli
like a syphilitic babushka!

10:37.098 --> 10:38.198
Quiet!

10:38.232 --> 10:40.200
You're both bourgeois
mediocrities.

10:40.234 --> 10:41.568
Wait.
Where are you going?

10:41.602 --> 10:43.737
I don't need you two
to get famous.

10:43.771 --> 10:44.771
Most people just come

10:44.806 --> 10:45.939
to hear the garmon anyway.

10:45.973 --> 10:47.007
Fine.

10:47.041 --> 10:48.575
The mariachi band
at El Compadre's

10:48.609 --> 10:50.043
been begging me to join 'em.

10:50.077 --> 10:51.144
And I'll just become

10:51.179 --> 10:52.646
a solo gusli sensation!

10:52.680 --> 10:54.748
(laughing)

10:54.782 --> 10:57.818
Look who thinks he's
the next Igor Kasminov.

10:57.852 --> 10:59.352
(gasps) That is it!

10:59.387 --> 11:02.556
From here on, consider
this balalaika trio kaputsky!

11:02.590 --> 11:04.257
Fine!

11:05.293 --> 11:07.761
Nothing will unite
us ever again!

11:07.795 --> 11:09.796
Presents!

11:11.532 --> 11:15.035
Hayley, this megaphone is
the absolute top-of-the-line.

11:15.069 --> 11:17.003
Certain to make you
the most annoying person

11:17.038 --> 11:18.505
at your next Occupy rally.

11:18.539 --> 11:20.607
Thanks, Dingus!

11:20.641 --> 11:24.010
Roger, I found you
this limited-edition

11:24.045 --> 11:26.980
porcelain doll
of JonBenet Ramsey...

11:27.014 --> 11:29.683
as an angel.

11:29.717 --> 11:32.886
Are you implying that there was
any version of her that wasn't?

11:32.920 --> 11:36.256
(crying):
Oh, God, I love her so much!

11:36.290 --> 11:39.359
Klaus, we got you
a Tiffany fishbowl.

11:39.393 --> 11:40.861
It's just like
your regular fishbowl,

11:40.895 --> 11:42.629
except it's expensive
for some reason.

11:42.663 --> 11:45.932
Whatever, as long as I have
the blue box to show the girls!

11:45.967 --> 11:48.702
And finally, for Stan,

11:48.736 --> 11:51.538
a custom Rolex with
a special display

11:51.572 --> 11:55.709
that counts down the minutes
until Rachel Maddow's death!

12:01.182 --> 12:03.850
How did I pay for all this?

12:03.885 --> 12:06.820
Well... money, of course.

12:09.090 --> 12:10.690
Oh, who are we kidding?!

12:10.725 --> 12:12.292
We lifted it!
We pinched it!

12:12.326 --> 12:14.628
We gave it the old Zazzoo!

12:14.662 --> 12:16.763
(gasps) I'm assuming
from context

12:16.797 --> 12:18.965
that old Zazzoo
also means stealing.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.433
Yes.
(gasps)

12:20.468 --> 12:22.669
I can't believe
what I'm hearing!

12:22.703 --> 12:24.871
Shoplifting?
Seriously, guys?

12:24.906 --> 12:26.172
For shame!

12:26.207 --> 12:28.575
(muffled laughter)

12:28.609 --> 12:30.677
Francine, what are we teaching
our children

12:30.711 --> 12:32.312
and aliens and fish?

12:32.346 --> 12:34.781
I may not have the authority
around here I once had,

12:34.815 --> 12:36.650
but damn it,
I still know what's right!

12:36.684 --> 12:39.219
I'm sorry, but Rachel Maddow's
death will just have

12:39.253 --> 12:41.254
to come
as a pleasant surprise to me.

12:41.289 --> 12:43.757
Promise me you two
will never steal again.

12:43.791 --> 12:46.593
Okay, Dad. I promise
we'll never shoplift again.

12:46.627 --> 12:48.228
Will we, Mom?

12:48.262 --> 12:50.363
Okay.

12:50.398 --> 12:51.631
Are we done here?

12:51.666 --> 12:53.800
'Cause we were in the
middle of a storm-off.

12:53.834 --> 12:55.969
Our balalaika trio is finished!

12:59.507 --> 13:01.241
Dad, are you bathing?

13:01.275 --> 13:03.643
'Cause it-it smells
like you're...

13:03.678 --> 13:05.712
not bathing.

13:08.249 --> 13:11.418
Well, this is still fun.

13:11.452 --> 13:13.753
I mean, we're hanging out.

13:13.788 --> 13:15.021
(loud slurping through straw)

13:15.056 --> 13:17.791
Um, we don't have to
hang out at the mall.

13:17.825 --> 13:19.292
We could always
get a motorcycle

13:19.327 --> 13:22.195
with a sidecar
and find lost dogs!

13:22.229 --> 13:24.097
Yeah. See you later, Mom.

13:24.131 --> 13:26.466
Wait! What if we
shoplift again?

13:26.500 --> 13:27.801
What?

13:27.835 --> 13:30.403
I mean... we can't
go out like this.

13:30.438 --> 13:32.272
We got to have one final heist.

13:32.306 --> 13:34.207
But we promised Dad.

13:34.241 --> 13:36.443
Look, this isn't just any heist.

13:36.477 --> 13:40.547
I'm talking
about hitting The Gash.

13:42.016 --> 13:43.783
The Gash?!

13:43.818 --> 13:45.251
You mean I'm finally ready?

13:45.286 --> 13:46.586
No, Steve.

13:46.621 --> 13:48.788
<i>We're</i> ready.

13:48.823 --> 13:50.290
Yeah, you're ready!

13:50.324 --> 13:52.325
I'm liking that confidence!

13:52.360 --> 13:54.394
Anyway, what's next?

13:54.428 --> 13:56.196
Where we going?

13:57.798 --> 14:00.333
Okay, I'll create a distraction

14:00.368 --> 14:02.736
while you run a
reverse snatch-and-grab

14:02.770 --> 14:04.504
down the cardigan table.

14:04.538 --> 14:06.706
Meet at the
fountain at 2:00.

14:06.741 --> 14:08.541
Got it.

14:09.577 --> 14:11.077
Excuse me.

14:11.112 --> 14:14.447
I think there's something
wrong with this changing room.

14:14.482 --> 14:16.282
(rats squeaking) (gasps)

14:16.317 --> 14:18.184
Oh, she is good.

14:18.219 --> 14:20.620
(indistinct shouting,
rats squeaking)

14:25.092 --> 14:26.893
Huh.

14:26.927 --> 14:30.630
Excuse me. Have you seen
my beautiful boy?

14:32.099 --> 14:33.633
Yeah, he was here.

14:33.668 --> 14:35.969
But our Loss Prevention
Unit has him now.

14:36.003 --> 14:37.704
(gasping)

14:37.738 --> 14:40.206
(insects trilling)

14:40.241 --> 14:42.208
(whirring and dinging) Aah!

14:42.243 --> 14:43.410
Hi there, shoplifter!

14:43.444 --> 14:44.911
Welcome to The Gash...

14:44.945 --> 14:46.146
sweatshop!

14:46.180 --> 14:47.280
(whirring)

14:47.314 --> 14:49.315
(Steve screams)

14:53.933 --> 14:55.400
(birds singing)

14:55.435 --> 14:56.919
Excuse me, miss?

14:57.039 --> 14:58.418
Hi. How can I help you today?

14:58.538 --> 15:01.377
I was just wondering, who's
my union representative?

15:01.497 --> 15:02.908
(screaming)

15:02.942 --> 15:03.631
Okay. Oh.

15:03.755 --> 15:05.152
Anything else
I can help you with?

15:05.193 --> 15:06.624
No, thanks.

15:06.658 --> 15:09.427
Okay, well, my name's Harper
if you need anything.

15:10.629 --> 15:12.763
How long have you been here?

15:12.798 --> 15:14.232
20 years.

15:14.266 --> 15:17.635
Oh, my God, I just realized
I can't take it anymore!

15:17.669 --> 15:18.836
(rhythmic beeping)

15:18.871 --> 15:20.271
(punches landing)

15:20.305 --> 15:21.939
(beeping stops)

15:21.974 --> 15:24.609
No! Not the sweater fold!

15:24.643 --> 15:28.112
(screaming, snapping)

15:28.146 --> 15:29.614
(grunting)

15:30.616 --> 15:31.883
(grunting)

15:31.917 --> 15:33.517
(panting):
Stan!

15:33.552 --> 15:35.653
I'm sorry. I ran
all the way home

15:35.687 --> 15:38.089
because I forgot
I had my car with me.

15:38.123 --> 15:42.827
The Gash's Loss Prevention Unit
caught Steve shoplifting!

15:42.861 --> 15:45.062
You guys were
shoplifting again?

15:45.097 --> 15:46.464
Skip the lecture.

15:46.498 --> 15:48.799
When people get caught
shoplifting from The Gash,

15:48.834 --> 15:51.335
they're never heard from again.

15:51.370 --> 15:53.204
Well, I wish I could help you,

15:53.238 --> 15:55.339
but I am powerless
without my nuggs.

15:55.374 --> 15:57.541
Only you can save our son.

15:57.576 --> 15:59.777
You're the man
of the house now.

16:01.079 --> 16:02.280
(doors creaking)

16:06.151 --> 16:08.152
Good-bye, Stan.

16:09.321 --> 16:11.822
Do whatever it takes
to get Steve back.

I say we reunite the

17:48.153 --> 17:49.353
How about it, Daddy?

17:49.388 --> 17:51.288
I suppose
I could give it a try.

17:51.323 --> 17:52.490
Yay!
(whoops)

17:52.524 --> 17:53.657
Yes!

17:53.692 --> 17:54.759
Yeah, it'll be fun, right?

17:54.793 --> 17:56.227
I mean, this could be
just what I need

17:56.261 --> 17:57.628
to get me out
of this living room.

17:57.662 --> 17:59.597
(two pops) (in normal
voice): And back into life.

17:59.631 --> 18:00.998

18:01.033 --> 18:02.166
No, no. No!

18:02.200 --> 18:04.068
Thank God.
I'm back to normal.

18:04.102 --> 18:05.336
I don't have to settle

18:05.370 --> 18:07.638

18:18.683 --> 18:20.151
(birds singing)

18:20.185 --> 18:21.919
Hello.

18:21.953 --> 18:25.256
Welcome to The Gash's
infamous third-world sweatshop.

18:25.290 --> 18:26.457
<i>Hola.</i>

18:26.491 --> 18:29.627
I'm an inspector from...
the government.

18:29.661 --> 18:33.831
We have concerns your sweatshop
isn't cruel enough.

18:33.865 --> 18:35.299
Ridiculous!

18:35.333 --> 18:38.202
As you can see, our facility
is exceptionally cruel.

18:38.236 --> 18:39.503
Our workers may pray

18:39.538 --> 18:41.772
for freedom,
but they hope for death.

18:41.807 --> 18:44.141
Oh, what a pretty coat!

18:44.176 --> 18:45.609
What's your name?

18:45.644 --> 18:47.778
Worker 39872.

18:47.813 --> 18:50.414
But I used
to be called Matilda.

18:50.449 --> 18:52.249
I don't like the spunk
in this one.

18:52.284 --> 18:54.819
Seems like she still
has some will to live.

18:54.853 --> 18:56.854
I'll interview her alone.

18:58.223 --> 19:00.524
Okay, Matilda, here's the deal.

19:00.559 --> 19:02.460
I'm not really an inspector.

19:02.494 --> 19:04.128
I'm a shoplifter,
just like you.

19:04.162 --> 19:05.796
Are-are you the one?

19:05.831 --> 19:07.998
The savior foretold
in our legends

19:08.033 --> 19:09.767
come to free us
from our bondage?

19:09.801 --> 19:11.569
Huh? No.

19:11.603 --> 19:13.370
Oh. That sucks.

19:13.405 --> 19:15.139
Have you seen this kid
around here?

19:15.173 --> 19:16.707
Well, I don't know him,

19:16.741 --> 19:20.010
but, uh, the latest batch of
arrivals ended up in Zone Q.

19:21.346 --> 19:23.481
Wait! If-if you're getting
out of here,

19:23.515 --> 19:24.982
could you take me with you?

19:25.016 --> 19:29.753
You have my word, Matilda.

19:37.462 --> 19:39.029
Steve?!

19:40.065 --> 19:41.532
Floobity-floobity!

19:41.566 --> 19:43.067
(grunts)

19:43.101 --> 19:44.235
Mom?!

19:44.269 --> 19:45.169
Steve!

19:45.203 --> 19:47.371
Let's get out of here.

19:47.405 --> 19:49.073
What about my sensor tag?

19:49.107 --> 19:50.574
You'll never get me
through those gates.

19:50.609 --> 19:52.276
(snap)

19:52.310 --> 19:53.911
Whoa. How'd you do that?

19:53.945 --> 19:55.746
This is me we're talking about.

19:55.780 --> 19:59.150
The woman who once crotchwalked
an oven out of a Sears.

19:59.184 --> 20:01.152
Crotchwalked?

20:01.186 --> 20:02.520
Oh, dear.

20:05.724 --> 20:06.857
Thanks for the access.

20:06.892 --> 20:09.126
I'll be sure to give
a favorable report.

20:09.161 --> 20:10.961
Thank you, and may I just say,

20:10.996 --> 20:13.130
you look in no way
suspicious to me.

20:15.734 --> 20:17.301
(pop) Aah!

20:17.335 --> 20:18.769
Just send me back to work.

20:18.803 --> 20:20.237
I can't be all up in that.

20:20.272 --> 20:22.006
She's trying
to liberate a shoplifter!

20:22.040 --> 20:23.541
Seize them!

20:23.575 --> 20:25.476
I'm really sorry, Mom.

20:25.510 --> 20:27.411
I blew it for both of us.

20:27.445 --> 20:29.446
You didn't blow
anything, sweetie.

20:29.481 --> 20:33.951
I've still got one last
shoplifting trick up my sleeve.

20:33.985 --> 20:36.987
(explosion)

20:37.022 --> 20:38.489
(machine gun fire)

20:38.523 --> 20:40.591
Not really a shoplifting trick
