WEBVTT

00:00.967 --> 00:03.301
(OPENING THEME PLAYING)

00:27.560 --> 00:28.961
Brother Blood!

00:28.963 --> 00:30.162
Titans!

00:30.164 --> 00:31.930
-(STOMACH GRUMBLING)
-Ahhh!

00:31.932 --> 00:33.098
I'd normally have
a long-winded

00:33.100 --> 00:35.034
evil scheme speech,
but, uh...

00:35.036 --> 00:36.702
And, this is embarrassing,

00:36.704 --> 00:38.203
my tum tum is acting up.

00:38.205 --> 00:40.606
-I think it's food poisoning.
-(STOMACH GROWLING)

00:40.608 --> 00:42.141
Oh, been there.

00:42.143 --> 00:43.609
That's the worst, bro.

00:43.611 --> 00:44.710
Indeed!

00:44.712 --> 00:46.412
But, the gist of what
I was going to say was,

00:46.414 --> 00:48.447
you shall fall
to my mind-control powers,

00:48.449 --> 00:49.982
become my pawns,

00:49.984 --> 00:51.350
and then, you know,
world domination,
blah, blah, blah.

00:51.352 --> 00:52.651
-(STOMACH GROWLING)
-Ooh!

00:52.653 --> 00:53.986
So, can we just
get on with this?

00:53.988 --> 00:55.587
Of course!
You poor dear.

00:55.589 --> 00:58.590
What're you waiting for?
He said his tum tum hurts.

00:58.592 --> 01:00.192
My bad. Titans, go!

01:32.859 --> 01:35.294
Your old mind-control tricks
won't work on us.

01:35.296 --> 01:38.797
Ooh! (COUGHING)
What is that odor?

01:38.799 --> 01:40.365
Oh! (COUGHING)

01:40.367 --> 01:43.035
I said I was having
stomach issues.

01:43.037 --> 01:44.870
(CHOKING)

01:44.872 --> 01:47.272
Robin is in the capacitated!

01:47.274 --> 01:49.741
He is inside the capacitated!

01:49.743 --> 01:51.810
-What do we do now?
-I don't know!

01:51.812 --> 01:54.980
Ah! Robin's the one
who tells us what to do!

01:54.982 --> 01:59.284
Well, I'd be more than happy
to tell you what to do.

02:02.322 --> 02:04.756
All hail, Brother Blood.

02:04.758 --> 02:06.859
All hail, Brother Blood.

02:06.861 --> 02:10.896
Now, my pawns,
we will create
a new world order...

02:10.898 --> 02:12.698
(STOMACH GROWLING)

02:12.700 --> 02:14.600
Assuming you are still here
when I get back
from the potty!

02:14.602 --> 02:15.834
Ugh! Ugh, oh...

02:17.303 --> 02:20.239
Uh... What? Batman?

02:20.241 --> 02:21.740
What? Huh?

02:21.742 --> 02:23.609
-Titans! Snap out of it!
-(FINGERS SNAPPING)

02:23.611 --> 02:24.977
Ah!

02:24.979 --> 02:27.946
I go down for one second,
and you guys just freeze up.

02:27.948 --> 02:29.281
Decisions are hard.

02:29.283 --> 02:31.817
That is why we let you
make them for us.

02:31.819 --> 02:34.887
I've always worried
being such a strong,
handsome leader

02:34.889 --> 02:37.122
might turn you all
into a bunch of sheep.

02:37.124 --> 02:39.925
(BLEATING)
Nah! Just me, bro.

02:39.927 --> 02:42.094
It's time you started
making your own decisions.

02:42.096 --> 02:44.630
For starters,
what does everyone
want for dinner?

02:44.632 --> 02:46.632
Hmmm, I don't know.
What do you want?

02:46.634 --> 02:49.101
I know exactly what I want,
where I want it,

02:49.103 --> 02:50.435
and when I'm going to have it.

02:50.437 --> 02:51.870
But, I'm not telling.

02:51.872 --> 02:55.007
That's cool.
We can decide on our own, bro.

02:55.009 --> 03:00.279
So, you guys
want to get some, uh...

03:03.550 --> 03:08.787
Perhaps, at the one place...

03:10.723 --> 03:16.528
Ooh!
Know what would be good...

03:22.168 --> 03:23.735
Look, I don't care.

03:23.737 --> 03:26.572
-Okay. How about pizza?
-Uh, no pizza for me.

03:26.574 --> 03:28.840
-You just said
you don't care.
-Tacos?

03:28.842 --> 03:30.342
No, anything but tacos.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.978
There are too many
of the delicious options.

03:32.980 --> 03:36.448
Sorry. I am not making
another decision for you guys.

03:40.687 --> 03:43.522
-And, I'm back!
-(TOILET FLUSHING)

03:43.524 --> 03:44.823
Oh!

03:49.462 --> 03:53.265
See, Robin. We were able
to make a decision
all on our own.

03:53.267 --> 03:55.200
Uh, yeah.

03:55.202 --> 03:57.402
You just followed me
into the restaurant,
and ordered what I ordered.

03:57.404 --> 04:02.040
Friends, our feast bag
contains strange,
tiny boomerangs!

04:02.042 --> 04:03.442
Free food!

04:07.080 --> 04:09.548
(CHOMPING) Ah!

04:09.550 --> 04:11.316
Mine was full of garbage!

04:11.318 --> 04:14.052
(GAGGING) Mine too!

04:14.054 --> 04:15.387
No wonder they're free!

04:15.389 --> 04:17.456
It's not garbage,
it's a fortune.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.791
A little advice
to help you make a decision.

04:19.793 --> 04:20.926
Advice?

04:20.928 --> 04:23.262
You mean, these cookies
will tell us what to do?

04:25.198 --> 04:26.898
(ALL GASPING)

04:28.468 --> 04:31.903
Hey, cookie.
Should I eat you?

04:31.905 --> 04:33.472
"Follow your passion."

04:33.474 --> 04:37.209
My passion
is eating free food!
(CHOMPING)

04:37.211 --> 04:40.279
Mmm! Mmm!
The fortune was right!

04:40.281 --> 04:41.980
Whoa, dude!

04:41.982 --> 04:45.217
These cookies are so wise.

04:45.219 --> 04:47.586
"Only by walking
through an open door

04:47.588 --> 04:49.588
"will you find your reward."

04:52.558 --> 04:55.027
Guys, guys! Cottage cheese!

04:56.229 --> 04:58.230
"You have many talents."

04:58.232 --> 05:00.499
Whoa! How did the cookie know?

05:00.501 --> 05:03.235
I do have lots of talents.

05:03.237 --> 05:06.305
"Laugh long, hard, and often."

05:06.307 --> 05:07.372

05:07.374 --> 05:11.510
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

05:11.512 --> 05:13.378
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

05:13.380 --> 05:16.248
Ah, ha, ha!
Hee, hee, hee, hee.

-Ha...
-Listen...

Ha, ha, ha, ha!

05:39.406 --> 05:40.806
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

05:48.414 --> 05:50.549
That was most enjoyable.

05:50.551 --> 05:53.518
They're just cookies!
You can't listen to them!

05:53.520 --> 05:55.053
Would you listen
to a palm reader?

05:55.055 --> 05:58.390
Oh, yeah!
What do my filthy palms say?

05:58.392 --> 06:00.826
Ugh. Is that mustard?
Look...

06:00.828 --> 06:03.095
<i>Fortune cookies,</i>
<i>palm reading, horoscopes,</i>

06:03.097 --> 06:05.163
<i>and other silly novelties</i>

06:05.165 --> 06:08.100
shouldn't be used to
make important decisions.

06:08.102 --> 06:10.869
That has to come from you.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.438
Beastie, what does the cookie
have to say about that?

06:14.807 --> 06:16.174
Hmm...

06:16.176 --> 06:20.379
"You will receive
some bad advice
from a trusted friend."

06:23.182 --> 06:25.417
Nice try, trusted friend!

06:25.419 --> 06:27.686
Now, if you will excuse us,
Robin,

06:27.688 --> 06:30.088
we have the decisions to make.

07:22.775 --> 07:25.710
Why are you guys
building a giant metal cage?

07:25.712 --> 07:27.979
A cookie told us
to build a giant metal cage.

07:27.981 --> 07:31.049
A cookie did not tell you
to build a giant metal cage.

07:32.952 --> 07:35.187
"Build a giant metal cage."
Oh!

07:35.189 --> 07:37.022
-It did.
-Oh, yeah!

07:37.024 --> 07:38.490
That reminds me.

07:38.492 --> 07:40.459
Another cookie said
I need to punch you
in the face.

07:40.461 --> 07:41.893
Well, that's... Ow!

07:41.895 --> 07:44.496
And mine said to use
the heat beam eyes on you.

07:44.498 --> 07:45.964
Ahhh!

07:45.966 --> 07:47.532
Mine said to give you
some of the good stuff...

07:47.534 --> 07:48.900
The Old Schlablamo!

07:48.902 --> 07:50.602
-Schlablamo!
-(GRUNTING)

07:52.939 --> 07:55.574
Fortune cookies
aren't that specific.

07:55.576 --> 07:57.342
Some are even more specific.

07:57.344 --> 07:59.978
"After you're done
hitting Robin,
put him in the cage.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.414
"Then, put yourselves
in the cage and lock the cage.

"Sit there patiently.

"If Robin tries to escape,
hit him again.

08:05.886 --> 08:07.953
"If he complains,
hit him again."

08:07.955 --> 08:09.955
It keeps going,
but you get the idea.

08:09.957 --> 08:12.924
-Now, into the cage,
please, Robin.
-No!

08:12.926 --> 08:15.994
These cookies
have taken control
of your minds.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.562
Mind control!

08:17.564 --> 08:19.164
Brother Blood!

08:19.166 --> 08:21.099
Very good, Robin.

08:21.101 --> 08:23.435
I have wasted so much time
with these complicated
mind-control plots,

08:23.437 --> 08:26.905
but the truth is
people are desperate
to be told what to do.

08:26.907 --> 08:29.541
So, what better way
than fortune cookies.

08:29.543 --> 08:31.510
Diabolical!
But, it won't work!

08:31.512 --> 08:35.480
Don't expect me to be defeated
so easily this time, Robin!

08:35.482 --> 08:37.449
All I ate today was a salad.

08:37.451 --> 08:40.385
No diet soda, hamburger
and cookies for me.

08:40.387 --> 08:44.055
Ooh!
I wanted a chocolate shake
so bad on my way over here,

08:44.057 --> 08:45.123
but I just said no.

08:45.125 --> 08:47.492
It's not worth
the anxiety and stress.

08:47.494 --> 08:48.860
Oh, look!

08:48.862 --> 08:51.630
They are about to open
their next fortunes.

08:53.232 --> 08:55.000
"Destroy Robin!"

08:56.769 --> 08:59.838
I see now that most people are
weak-minded sheep,

08:59.840 --> 09:02.140
incapable of making
their own decisions!

09:02.142 --> 09:05.210
Yes, and I am the shepherd,
Robin!

09:05.212 --> 09:07.812
But, you are forgetting
one thing, Blood!

09:07.814 --> 09:11.182
There's more than one way
to influence weak minds!

09:11.184 --> 09:14.586
-Would you like me
to read your palm?
-Oh, yeah!

09:14.588 --> 09:17.756
Ooh, these lines say,
"Wash your hands

09:17.758 --> 09:19.691
"and punch Brother Blood
in the face!"

09:19.693 --> 09:21.159
You are the boss, palm!

you are a Taurus, aren't you?

09:27.834 --> 09:30.201
(GASPING) How could you tell?

09:30.203 --> 09:33.738
Mercury is in retrograde
and you know what that means.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.507
Punch Brother Blood
in the face!

09:35.509 --> 09:37.108
I am Taurus!

09:37.110 --> 09:39.044

09:41.314 --> 09:44.716
Wait! This magical ball
has a message for you.

09:44.718 --> 09:46.685
"Punch Brother Blood
in the face."

09:46.687 --> 09:48.253
Sounds good to me.

09:52.925 --> 09:56.161
Your future
looks prosperous in jail!

09:57.763 --> 10:00.398
If I knew
it was going to end like this,

10:00.400 --> 10:02.901
I would have gotten
that chocolate shake.

10:03.569 --> 10:05.170
I am sorry, Titans.

10:05.172 --> 10:07.906
I thought you would be able
to make your own decisions.

10:07.908 --> 10:10.208
I was wrong
for believing in you.

10:10.210 --> 10:11.743
We all make mistakes.

10:11.745 --> 10:13.311
So, what do you want
for dinner?

10:14.614 --> 10:17.215
We could do...

10:18.818 --> 10:23.154
We could hit that one place...

10:23.156 --> 10:25.223
ALL: Uh...
