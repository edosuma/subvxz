<i>Michael Bluth began his day</i>
<i>with something he'd never seen before.</i>

00:23.139 --> 00:25.307
<i>I'm hearing good things about the</i>
<i>Bluth Company. What do you think?</i>

00:25.391 --> 00:27.810
<i>Good news</i>
<i>about his family's housing business.</i>

00:27.893 --> 00:30.604
<i>Old man Bluth is in jail.</i>
<i>I think his son is running the company.</i>

00:30.688 --> 00:32.689
<i>Doesn't seem like a total moron to me.</i>

00:32.773 --> 00:34.900
<i>You know what?</i>
<i>I've had this thing as a triple sell,</i>

00:34.984 --> 00:37.153
<i>and I am upgrading it right here,</i>
<i>right now.</i>

00:37.236 --> 00:40.823
<i>I think this thing could even go</i>
<i>as high as a "Don't Buy."</i>

00:40.906 --> 00:43.075
- Don't buy?
<i>- Don't buy. I started off...</i>

00:43.159 --> 00:45.744
- Mom, did you see that?
<i>- Don't buy Bluth!</i>

00:45.828 --> 00:49.331
You build a house that's good,
people are gonna wanna come...

00:53.252 --> 00:55.421
This sink hole spread
a little bit more last night?

00:55.504 --> 00:58.549
Anyway, I'm gonna go to the prison.
I'm gonna tell Dad about this news.

00:58.632 --> 01:00.426
I thought you said we shouldn't visit him.

01:00.509 --> 01:02.219
Visit, no. Gloat, yes.

01:02.303 --> 01:03.554
I've worked very, very hard for this.

01:03.637 --> 01:05.598
I sold the cabin property to keep us afloat,

01:05.681 --> 01:07.683
I haven't had any time
to spend with my son.

01:07.766 --> 01:10.311
Well, now you can spend time
with my son.

01:10.394 --> 01:12.730
I want your brother Buster
to come live with you,

01:12.813 --> 01:16.609
and it's not because
he has that horrible hook for a hand now.

01:16.692 --> 01:18.903
It's the snoring. Listen to this.

01:18.986 --> 01:21.447
<i>Buster snoring, Wednesday night.</i>

01:22.698 --> 01:25.034
<i>It's driving me...</i>

01:25.117 --> 01:26.452
You won't even know he's here.

01:26.535 --> 01:28.787
You seem more villainous
than usual, Mom. Are you sober?

01:28.871 --> 01:31.999
- Michael, it's 8:00 a.m.
- So, it's not that.

01:33.209 --> 01:37.171
I don't know. Maybe it's because
I went off my postpartum medication.

01:37.254 --> 01:40.341
You were still taking that?
You had Buster 32 years ago.

01:40.424 --> 01:43.135
And that's how long
I've been depressed about him.

01:43.218 --> 01:45.846
Actually, I did go off it in the early '90s

01:45.930 --> 01:47.473
but I didn't like what happened to me.

01:47.556 --> 01:49.308
<i>Claiming she could take it no more,</i>

01:49.391 --> 01:51.393
<i>the young mother released</i>
<i>the emergency brake,</i>

01:51.477 --> 01:55.314
<i>allowing her car to roll backwards</i>
<i>into the nearby lake.</i>

01:55.397 --> 01:56.899
Good for her.

01:58.943 --> 02:00.569
I must have gained three pounds.

02:00.653 --> 02:02.321
Why did you go off them this time?

02:02.404 --> 02:06.533
Well, apparently, mood-altering
medication leads to street drugs.

02:06.617 --> 02:10.412
That's what this very handsome
young doctor said on <i>The Today Show.</i>

02:11.372 --> 02:13.624
That was Tom Cruise, the actor.

02:13.707 --> 02:16.543
They said he was some kind of scientist.

02:16.961 --> 02:18.671
Maybe you should get away from Buster.

02:18.754 --> 02:21.131
Why don't you go up
to that cabin in the woods?

02:21.215 --> 02:23.384
- I thought you said we sold it.
- We sold the property.

02:23.467 --> 02:25.469
I worked it out so we could
relocate the cabin,

02:25.552 --> 02:28.389
but it is gonna be up
in Tahoe for another couple of days.

02:28.472 --> 02:31.058
Maybe you can take a date up there.

02:31.266 --> 02:35.813
How am I supposed to find someone
willing to go into that musty old claptrap?

02:39.650 --> 02:43.070
The cabin. Yes. Yeah, that, well,
that would be difficult, too.

02:44.905 --> 02:48.826
Please get back on the meds, Mom.
We miss the old, old you.

02:50.994 --> 02:53.414
I didn't even know that we had a cabin.

02:54.707 --> 02:57.584
Well, for what it's worth, Gob,
I've never actually been there.

02:57.668 --> 02:59.378
<i>Although he'd often been promised.</i>

02:59.461 --> 03:03.716
Hey, pal, something's come up.
This nice young lady has lost her puppy,

03:03.799 --> 03:05.676
and your dad's got to help her find him.

03:05.759 --> 03:08.011
Bad news, buddy.

03:08.095 --> 03:11.515
This young lady's dad is sick,
and I'm taking her to the hospital.

03:11.598 --> 03:15.018
Come on, you're old enough
to figure this out. I'm nailing this broad.

03:15.102 --> 03:18.105
Pardon me
if I don't burst into tears, Michael,

03:18.188 --> 03:20.607
but at least he promised to take you.

03:20.691 --> 03:23.652
He just let me blindly enjoy my childhood.

03:23.819 --> 03:27.739
I didn't even know there was a cabin
that he wasn't taking me to.

03:27.823 --> 03:31.326
- Mine's sadder.
- I don't see you crying, robot.

03:31.410 --> 03:33.662
You taste these tears. Taste my sadness.

03:33.745 --> 03:36.290
No. Not gonna lick your eye, okay?

03:36.790 --> 03:38.709
Well, I will tell you this, Michael.

03:38.792 --> 03:40.461
- I don't have a son.
<i>- He does.</i>

03:40.544 --> 03:43.672
But if I ever do, I'm either gonna take him
to the cabin in the woods,

03:43.755 --> 03:46.133
or I'm going to promise to take him
but then not take him.

03:46.216 --> 03:48.760
But the one thing that I will never do

03:48.844 --> 03:51.680
is not tell him that I'm taking him
to a cabin in the woods

03:51.763 --> 03:53.557
and then not take him.

03:53.640 --> 03:55.434
<i>Gob was growing up.</i>

03:55.601 --> 03:59.104
Well, the cabin in the woods is going
to be stacked up next to our carport.

03:59.188 --> 04:02.065
But maybe we should
head up there tonight, huh?

04:02.149 --> 04:04.902
One first time.

04:06.361 --> 04:09.156
Taste the happy, Michael. Taste it.

04:09.239 --> 04:10.908
Tastes kind of like sad.

04:10.991 --> 04:15.412
<i>Michael set off to prison to tell off</i>
<i>his father when he discovered his son.</i>

04:15.495 --> 04:17.539
- George Michael?
- Dad, hey.

04:17.623 --> 04:19.458
- What're you doing?
- I didn't want to miss you

04:19.541 --> 04:21.209
because you've been
leaving so early lately.

04:21.293 --> 04:22.753
You slept out here to see me?

04:22.836 --> 04:26.673
<i>Michael had never been so touched</i>
<i>by something his son had said,</i>

04:26.757 --> 04:27.925
<i>but it wasn't true.</i>

04:28.008 --> 04:31.595
<i>He was hiding from his cousin</i>
<i>after an awkward incident.</i>

04:34.765 --> 04:37.059
<i>They'd since been trying</i>
<i>to avoid each other,</i>

04:37.142 --> 04:40.771
<i>which was difficult considering</i>
<i>they shared a bunk bed.</i>

04:43.065 --> 04:44.566
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:46.235 --> 04:48.070
- I'm off to the car.
- I'll be in the crawl space.

04:48.153 --> 04:50.614
Tell you what. How would you like
to head up to the cabin?

04:50.697 --> 04:52.074
Can you afford to skip work?

04:52.157 --> 04:56.328
I think the President of a "Don't Buy"
company can afford to take a day off.

04:56.411 --> 04:58.288
We're up from "Sell?"

04:58.914 --> 05:01.083
- It's happening, isn't it?
- It's really happening.

05:01.166 --> 05:03.001
It's time for us
to start creating some memories.

05:03.085 --> 05:06.755
You know, there's been
enough disappointment in this family.

05:09.549 --> 05:11.843
There's only one sleeping bag,
so we're gonna have to double up.

05:11.927 --> 05:13.303
Pigs in a blanket.

05:13.387 --> 05:17.015
Sorry, pal, something came up.

05:18.225 --> 05:19.643
It is worse to know.

05:19.726 --> 05:22.521
<i>Gob was getting life lessons</i>
<i>all over the place.</i>

05:22.604 --> 05:25.941
<i>And Michael broke a two month silence</i>
<i>and went to visit his father.</i>

05:26.024 --> 05:28.610
<i>You came. Someone came. I'm...</i>

05:28.694 --> 05:31.071
Only to tell you
that the company is back on track

05:31.154 --> 05:32.656
and it's because you're behind bars.

05:32.739 --> 05:35.701
And now I get to do with my son
what you never did with me.

05:35.784 --> 05:38.203
- I'm taking him to the cabin.
<i>...scar.</i>

05:38.286 --> 05:39.788
<i>And every night...</i>

05:39.871 --> 05:42.874
I'm scarred, too,
but my son is not going to be.

05:42.958 --> 05:45.293
<i>And they cover it with soap,</i>

05:45.377 --> 05:47.087
<i>and you're supposed to thank them...</i>

05:47.170 --> 05:49.506
<i>- So, that's it. That's all I came to say.</i>
...you a favour.

05:49.589 --> 05:51.842
Is there anything you'd like for me
to pass on to the family?

05:51.925 --> 05:53.719
I'm your uncle.

05:53.802 --> 05:56.179
I'm your dad's twin brother.

05:56.930 --> 05:59.808
I'm Oscar. He switched on me.

06:00.308 --> 06:01.852
<i>No one believes me.</i>

06:01.935 --> 06:03.270
<i>Unfortunately for Oscar,</i>

06:03.353 --> 06:06.398
<i>"You've got the wrong twin"</i>
<i>was a very popular alibi.</i>

06:06.481 --> 06:08.191
You simply got the wrong twin.

06:08.275 --> 06:11.236
We're quadruplets.
You got the wrong two.

06:11.319 --> 06:14.072
- We're Larry and Dave.
- You want Curtis and Jeff.

06:14.156 --> 06:17.200
<i>I even started a website, imoscar. com.</i>

06:18.326 --> 06:20.203
I'm innocent, Michael.

06:20.287 --> 06:22.998
Imoscar. com.

06:24.708 --> 06:27.043
<i>No, don't buy it.</i>
<i>I'm taking my son to the cabin</i>

06:27.127 --> 06:31.506
<i>and there's nothing you can say to make</i>
<i>me believe that you are not my father.</i>

06:31.965 --> 06:33.425
<i>I understand.</i>

06:34.509 --> 06:36.511
<i>Your child comes first.</i>

06:38.430 --> 06:41.308
<i>- Oh, my God, you're Oscar.</i>
<i>- Dot com.</i>

06:46.813 --> 06:50.734
<i>So Michael returned to the office</i>
<i>to try and free his uncle.</i>

06:50.984 --> 06:53.403
Don't buy. Don't buy. Don't buy.

06:53.487 --> 06:56.948
<i>Then he realised how much</i>
<i>that freedom would cost his employees.</i>

06:57.032 --> 06:59.075
Don't buy. We did it, Mikey.

06:59.159 --> 07:02.996
We're super rich again.
And I'm gonna buy a car, the Volvo.

07:03.079 --> 07:06.124
No, Lindsay, you're not gonna start
spending money. And this is not a Volvo.

07:06.208 --> 07:07.626
That's from sitting on the copier.

07:07.709 --> 07:09.920
- Lindsay...
- Michael, I've got nothing.

07:10.003 --> 07:12.506
My husband dumped me
and ran off to Vegas with Kitty,

07:12.589 --> 07:15.467
- that bleached blonde whore.
- Well, he's definitely got a type.

07:15.550 --> 07:19.596
I can't believe he left me.
I mean, this and these,

07:19.679 --> 07:21.014
and this.

07:21.097 --> 07:24.017
- That's the car.
- This.

07:24.100 --> 07:25.352
Thank God I didn't spring for colour.

07:25.435 --> 07:28.230
Lindsay, the only reason you want
Tobias is because you can't have him,

07:28.313 --> 07:29.898
and the second
that you can have something,

07:29.981 --> 07:31.191
all of a sudden you don't want it.

07:31.274 --> 07:33.443
That's not who I am, Michael.

07:33.527 --> 07:36.488
All right, maybe you're right.
Maybe we should get you this car.

07:36.571 --> 07:39.074
Yeah, I don't know. It's so boxy.

07:41.076 --> 07:45.121
- Gob.
- Michael, how's Dad?

07:45.205 --> 07:47.749
I don't know. It's Oscar who's in prison,

07:47.832 --> 07:50.126
and if I let him out,
people will know that Dad is free,

07:50.210 --> 07:53.171
and those people out there
will end up paying for it.

07:53.255 --> 07:57.217
Our dad hasn't
tried to contact you, has he?

07:57.842 --> 08:01.179
Yeah, like I'd ever hear
from that son of a bitch.

08:01.638 --> 08:04.140
<i>Earlier that day, Gob received a letter</i>

08:04.224 --> 08:08.061
<i>from a group that reunited</i>
<i>abandoned sons with their fathers,</i>

08:08.144 --> 08:10.897
<i>- called S.A.D.</i>
- Father-son reunion?

08:12.399 --> 08:13.775
But Dad's still in prison.

08:13.858 --> 08:15.694
<i>But now the letter made sense.</i>

08:15.777 --> 08:18.113
That son of a bitch.

08:18.196 --> 08:21.157
<i>- Law offices of Barry Zuckerkorn.</i>
- Hi, it's Michael Bluth for Barry.

08:21.241 --> 08:23.076
<i>Barry went to Reno to see your father.</i>

08:23.159 --> 08:25.912
Reno? He said he's been visiting
my father in prison.

08:25.996 --> 08:29.290
Yeah, Barry says a lot of things
he doesn't mean.

08:30.500 --> 08:33.003
Well, I guess I'm going to Reno
to look for Dad.

08:33.086 --> 08:35.380
Good luck, favourite son.

08:36.047 --> 08:38.717
<i>So once again Michael went</i>
<i>after the father</i>

08:38.799 --> 08:40.635
<i>who'd once again abandoned him</i>

08:40.719 --> 08:44.806
<i>only to find he was about to do</i>
<i>the same thing to his own son.</i>

08:46.057 --> 08:49.144
- It's not happening, is it?
- Something came up.

08:54.441 --> 08:57.694
<i>Michael had just told his son</i>
<i>they wouldn't be going to the cabin.</i>

08:57.777 --> 08:58.987
But the cabin's in Lake Tahoe,

08:59.070 --> 09:00.739
so I'm saying that's right near Reno
and we could...

09:00.822 --> 09:02.490
Yeah, but this is gonna be
like an adult trip.

09:02.574 --> 09:03.658
Aunt Lindsay will be here.

09:03.742 --> 09:07.454
Hi. Why don't you pop a tent in front
with your cousin Maeby?

09:07.537 --> 09:10.707
- What? No!
- I'm not really the outdoorsy type.

09:10.790 --> 09:14.169
Well, then this is a good chance
for you to rub off on her.

09:17.297 --> 09:22.010
<i>As Michael set out to find his father,</i>
<i>Gob thought he was doing the same.</i>

09:22.761 --> 09:24.262
There's my guy.

09:25.597 --> 09:27.307
Hey, buddy, come on.

09:29.934 --> 09:31.811
Getting them to track down your dad, too?

09:31.895 --> 09:34.314
My dad actually had them track me down.

09:35.899 --> 09:39.027
But it does look like he's not gonna show.

09:40.612 --> 09:43.865
Kind of feel like that kid
who found the severed hand.

09:45.033 --> 09:47.285
Hey, Dad, look what I found.

09:47.952 --> 09:50.538
Anything for his father's approval.

09:51.873 --> 09:53.416
Heartbreaking.

09:54.292 --> 09:55.627
You look familiar.

09:55.710 --> 09:58.004
I think that's because
we actually kind of look alike.

09:58.087 --> 10:01.132
<i>- Remember when I said Gob had a son?</i>
- I'm Gob.

10:01.216 --> 10:03.009
<i>I wasn't just saying that.</i>

10:03.092 --> 10:06.638
<i>In high school,</i>
<i>Gob became intimate with these girls.</i>

10:06.721 --> 10:08.807
<i>These girls got pregnant.</i>

10:08.890 --> 10:10.517
<i>This one had a baby.</i>

10:10.683 --> 10:12.977
<i>And that baby would grow up to be</i>

10:13.228 --> 10:15.104
<i>- Steve Holt.</i>
- Steve Holt.

10:15.188 --> 10:18.608
All I ever wanted was to spend
a little time with my dad,

10:18.691 --> 10:20.068
maybe go camping.

10:20.151 --> 10:21.903
I guess that will never happen.

10:21.986 --> 10:24.197
Look, I know this is gonna sound
kind of crazy,

10:24.280 --> 10:27.575
but my family actually has
a cabin in the woods for one more night.

10:27.659 --> 10:30.161
Maybe we could go up to Reno,
get the keys and go camping.

10:30.245 --> 10:33.998
You know, sort of a son-and-son thing.

10:34.332 --> 10:36.042
<i>If Steve had had a father,</i>

10:36.125 --> 10:39.462
<i>he would've warned him not to go</i>
<i>into the woods with strange men.</i>

10:39.546 --> 10:40.672
<i>But he didn't.</i>

10:40.755 --> 10:43.466
- Sure, let's go!
- Okay, great!

10:43.550 --> 10:45.510
- This is me right here.
- Okay.

10:45.593 --> 10:46.844
- Yeah, baby.
- Steve Holt!

10:47.554 --> 10:49.931
<i>Michael, meanwhile, arrived in Reno,</i>

10:50.014 --> 10:52.892
<i>a city competing</i>
<i>with Las Vegas' successful</i>

10:52.976 --> 10:56.271
<i>"What happens in Vegas</i>
<i>stays in Vegas " campaign,</i>

10:56.354 --> 10:58.731
<i>and set about searching</i>
<i>for Barry Zuckerkorn.</i>

10:58.815 --> 11:03.444
Hi. I'm looking for a man who's probably
in the seedy underbelly of Reno.

11:03.528 --> 11:07.282
The Christian League had
the Seedy Underbelly shut down.

11:07.365 --> 11:08.950
Now it's a Swallows.

11:09.033 --> 11:12.120
<i>Swallows was</i>
<i>a family-style restaurant by day,</i>

11:12.203 --> 11:13.413
<i>and an anything-goes</i>

11:13.496 --> 11:15.748
<i>- pan-sexual bazaar by night.</i>
- Welcome to Swallows.

11:15.832 --> 11:19.168
Can I interest you
in a Smoothie, or an... Michael!

11:19.252 --> 11:23.172
Tobias, I thought that you were in Vegas
with Kitty and the Blue Man Group.

11:23.256 --> 11:24.424
No, as it turns out,

11:24.507 --> 11:28.928
the part that I'd destroyed my life to get
had already been cast.

11:29.012 --> 11:33.599
<i>The role was filled by George, Sr,</i>
<i>who used it to hide in plain sight.</i>

11:33.683 --> 11:36.936
<i>That is until he choked on a marshmallow</i>
<i>and almost died</i>

11:37.020 --> 11:39.564
<i>when no one noticed he turned blue.</i>

11:39.647 --> 11:43.860
So, Kitty suggested we come up here
to try out in Reno and...

11:44.193 --> 11:45.737
I'll be honest, Michael.

11:45.820 --> 11:50.074
Leaving Lindsay was
the biggest little mistake I've ever made.

11:50.158 --> 11:53.703
I can't seem to call her, though.
Damn this pride of mine!

11:53.786 --> 11:56.748
Tuna melt's up, and you need to flip
the cushions in the grind room.

11:56.831 --> 11:58.583
Yes, sir. Right away, sir. Oh, great.

11:58.666 --> 12:01.210
Now I'm gonna be smelling to high heaven
like a tuna melt.

12:01.294 --> 12:02.962
Tobias, what would you say if I told you

12:03.046 --> 12:06.299
that Lindsay might be willing
to get back together with you?

12:06.382 --> 12:09.218
- I'll call her right now.
- Actually, why don't you let me handle it?

12:09.302 --> 12:11.721
You know Lindsay.
She only wants what she can't have.

12:11.804 --> 12:13.056
What would you do about Kitty?

12:13.139 --> 12:15.058
I can't lie to you, Michael.

12:16.100 --> 12:18.019
Kitty left me two days ago.

12:18.102 --> 12:20.271
There's a blue handprint
on the back of your head, Kitty.

12:20.354 --> 12:21.773
Are you seeing someone else?

12:21.856 --> 12:24.609
Face it, Tobias. It's over.

12:25.526 --> 12:29.113
- Say goodbye to these!
- Those are blue too.

12:29.197 --> 12:31.741
- There were blue handprints on them?
- Yes.

12:31.824 --> 12:34.619
- And I swear to you, they weren't...
- Yours. No, I know.

12:34.702 --> 12:35.995
It all points to Dad.

12:36.079 --> 12:39.332
Dad's in Reno, Kitty's in Reno,
Dad's in Kitty, and he must be a Blue Man.

12:39.415 --> 12:43.461
- I'm gonna go check out the theatre.
- Okay, I'll meet you there.

12:43.544 --> 12:47.089
I just have to break down the salad bar
and set up the leather pony.

12:47.173 --> 12:48.382
What's a leather pony?

12:48.466 --> 12:51.052
I don't know. We don't have that at lunch.

12:51.928 --> 12:54.680
<i>So Michael called Lindsay</i>
<i>to say he'd found her husband.</i>

12:54.764 --> 12:56.516
All right, I'm on my way.

12:56.599 --> 12:59.393
No, no I'll just bring him back with me.

12:59.477 --> 13:00.895
He wants to come home?

13:00.978 --> 13:02.522
I mean, against his will.

13:02.605 --> 13:04.899
Well, knock him out if you have to.
He's my husband.

13:04.982 --> 13:07.944
Just watch the kids
like you promised, okay?

13:08.820 --> 13:10.363
- I'm not.
- Neither am I.

13:10.446 --> 13:11.656
Hold it.

13:12.156 --> 13:16.786
<i>And the kids found themselves closer</i>
<i>than ever on the bumpy road to Reno.</i>

13:17.703 --> 13:19.831
- Hello?
<i>- Lindsay, hey, hi.</i>

13:20.081 --> 13:22.917
Michael said not to call you,
but I missed you so much.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.252
You miss me?

13:24.544 --> 13:25.837
- What're you doing?
- Nothing.

13:25.920 --> 13:27.213
- What're you doing?
- Nothing.

13:27.296 --> 13:30.174
I was driving out there, but this is crazy.
We have to be realistic.

13:30.258 --> 13:33.469
No, no. But I, the thing is,
I can't leave Kitty. I just...

13:33.553 --> 13:36.097
What with, all the sexual intercourse
and whatnot.

13:36.180 --> 13:37.640
You bastard!

13:37.723 --> 13:39.016
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

13:39.100 --> 13:40.184
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

13:40.268 --> 13:43.938
I will be backstage after the Blue Man
show whether Kitty likes it or not.

13:44.021 --> 13:46.983
Sounds good. One quick question, though.
What if Kitty's not there

13:47.066 --> 13:50.486
and I'm less of a Blue Man
and more of a cocktail waitress?

13:50.945 --> 13:52.780
- She's turning again.
- Hang up. Hang up.

13:52.863 --> 13:54.615
<i>I'll see you there. Thank you. Bye.</i>

13:54.699 --> 13:57.410
<i>Michael was already at the theatre</i>
<i>looking for George, Sr,</i>

13:57.493 --> 14:00.204
<i>when he ran into Barry doing</i>
<i>the same thing.</i>

14:00.288 --> 14:02.915
- Hey, Barry.
- Hi, Mikey.

14:02.999 --> 14:04.166
So, how much do you know?

14:04.250 --> 14:07.336
I know that Oscar is in prison,
and that my father is a Blue Man,

14:07.420 --> 14:09.839
and that you are clearly
in cahoots with him.

14:09.922 --> 14:11.299
- A lot.
- Where is he?

14:11.382 --> 14:14.885
I don't know. I was gonna meet him here,
but he must've seen you and run off.

14:14.969 --> 14:19.098
I was gonna give him this.
$250,000 and a passport.

14:19.932 --> 14:22.935
- Just a passport.
- Well, I was up for so long.

14:23.019 --> 14:24.729
Barry, you're fired.

14:25.229 --> 14:27.231
- What?
- Yeah.

14:27.315 --> 14:29.692
Just like that? No warning?

14:29.775 --> 14:32.278
You're my only client.
What am I supposed to do now?

14:32.361 --> 14:33.487
Turn tricks on the street?

14:33.571 --> 14:35.531
How much do you think
I can get for that, by the way?

14:35.614 --> 14:37.575
All right, this is crazy.
I've got to let Oscar out of prison.

14:37.658 --> 14:41.454
What about making out?
$50, or is that just L. A? Am I just...

14:47.418 --> 14:51.756
<i>Soon, Lindsay arrived at the hotel</i>
<i>and the kids finally faced facts.</i>

14:52.798 --> 14:54.717
Look, it was just a half kiss, all right?

14:54.800 --> 14:56.594
Maybe that's the reason
why we're acting weird.

14:56.677 --> 14:59.221
It's because we didn't finish the kiss?
Is that...

14:59.305 --> 15:02.725
Yeah, I mean, do you think we should
just finish the kiss, get it out of the way?

15:02.808 --> 15:04.727
Let's get it out of the way.

15:06.228 --> 15:08.856
Kids, bring the bags.
We're sharing a room.

15:08.939 --> 15:11.108
All right, let's meet back here
tomorrow morning, okay?

15:11.192 --> 15:12.985
- Yeah. Are you...
- Go.

15:13.736 --> 15:15.696
Yeah, I'm gonna...

15:15.780 --> 15:19.825
I'm gonna stay out here
and watch that famous Reno sunset.

15:21.535 --> 15:23.204
Isn't it behind you?

15:24.497 --> 15:26.665
There's... Yeah, but there's mirrors.

15:26.749 --> 15:28.167
It'll actually look closer.

15:28.250 --> 15:32.171
<i>While George Michael waited for</i>
<i>the sunset, another set of sons arrived.</i>

15:32.254 --> 15:34.090
Yeah, well, Michael said
he'd meet me here.

15:34.173 --> 15:37.218
I guess I'll get the keys to the cabin, son.

15:37.802 --> 15:40.513
I'll go buy some fishing stuff, son.

15:41.430 --> 15:43.140
So, where did you get this kid?

15:43.224 --> 15:44.809
Yeah, I guess I can tell you now.

15:44.892 --> 15:48.646
We were both waiting for our dads at the
garden where the little boy found the arm.

15:48.729 --> 15:51.065
Kid's amazing, though. It's almost like...

15:51.148 --> 15:52.775
I wish he could be my dad.

15:52.858 --> 15:57.404
Okay, your dad's not trying to find you,
your son is. That kid's your son.

15:57.488 --> 15:59.031
You're the dad.

16:05.830 --> 16:07.832
I've made a huge tiny mistake.

16:07.915 --> 16:08.958
No, no, Gob, Gob.

16:09.041 --> 16:11.752
You can't just leave your son
in the middle of a parking lot in Reno.

16:11.836 --> 16:15.381
<i>And that's when Michael saw his own son</i>
<i>in a parking lot in Reno.</i>

16:15.464 --> 16:18.676
He drove all the way up here
to be with me. Wow.

16:19.051 --> 16:21.971
Well, I guess I'm no better than...

16:25.516 --> 16:26.725
No, I'm better.

16:26.809 --> 16:30.229
<i>They were an hour out of Reno,</i>
<i>when George Michael woke up.</i>

16:30.312 --> 16:33.607
You were out like a light, pal.
Our dreams are about to come true.

16:33.691 --> 16:36.819
- Maeby?
- Definitely. We are going camping.

16:36.902 --> 16:38.612
It's finally happening.

16:39.947 --> 16:41.282
It's never happening.

16:45.035 --> 16:48.664
<i>Michael had just surprised</i>
<i>his sleeping son by taking him camping.</i>

16:48.747 --> 16:51.125
I put this off too long,
and it's too important.

16:51.208 --> 16:53.794
Your uncle Oscar can stay in prison
one more day, right?

16:53.878 --> 16:56.964
<i>Not according to that day's blog</i>
<i>on imoscar. com.</i>

16:57.214 --> 17:00.342
This, here, is way more important
than me trying to find my father.

17:00.426 --> 17:03.721
Although, I was very close.
I almost had Pop-pop in Reno.

17:04.430 --> 17:05.681
Me, too.

17:05.931 --> 17:09.476
<i>As Michael was forcibly taking his son</i>
<i>out to the cabin,</i>

17:09.560 --> 17:12.730
<i>Lucille was ready</i>
<i>to forcibly throw hers out.</i>

17:25.200 --> 17:26.910
Well, that was a freebie.

17:26.993 --> 17:30.581
<i>Lucille didn't trust herself to be</i>
<i>in the house when Buster returned,</i>

17:30.664 --> 17:34.293
<i>so she headed off to the cabin</i>
<i>Michael said would be unoccupied.</i>

17:34.376 --> 17:37.463
<i>Tobias, meanwhile, was looking</i>
<i>for a way to make his wife jealous</i>

17:37.546 --> 17:40.341
<i>by convincing her</i>
<i>that he was not only a Blue Man,</i>

17:40.424 --> 17:41.967
<i>but still with Kitty,</i>

17:42.051 --> 17:43.802
<i>when he came across a makeup woman</i>

17:43.886 --> 17:46.472
<i>who, coincidentally, looked</i>
<i>a great deal like Kitty.</i>

17:46.555 --> 17:48.640
If this tableau I recreate,

17:48.724 --> 17:51.894
perhaps I can re-snare my mate.

17:52.478 --> 17:54.688
<i>Gee, why wouldn't she want him back?</i>

17:54.772 --> 17:58.567
<i>And Michael and his son arrived</i>
<i>at the cabin in the woods.</i>

18:00.110 --> 18:02.946
Looks like they have trucked off
the bedrooms.

18:03.030 --> 18:06.784
Maybe we'll just set up some sleeping
bags right here in the living room, huh?

18:06.992 --> 18:09.995
<i>Lucille, meanwhile, heard a familiar sound.</i>

18:12.247 --> 18:14.708
- Come on!
- Mother?

18:14.792 --> 18:17.336
What the hell are you doing back there?

18:17.419 --> 18:21.048
I decided to sleep in the car
so my snoring wouldn't bother you,

18:21.131 --> 18:25.177
and I left that recording of my snoring
so you wouldn't know I'm gone.

18:25.260 --> 18:29.264
We're halfway to the cabin.
I'm gonna drop you by this light.

18:29.348 --> 18:31.141
Or I could come with you.

18:31.225 --> 18:34.478
That might be the exact shot in the arm
our relationship needs.

18:34.561 --> 18:38.107
Well, at least I'll have someone
to talk to on the way up.

18:47.616 --> 18:49.076
This is fun, isn't it?

18:49.159 --> 18:51.537
This is just like
when we used to live up in the attic.

18:51.620 --> 18:52.788
Yeah.

18:54.581 --> 18:58.752
- Or we could go back to Reno and...
- Go back to Reno?

18:59.419 --> 19:02.965
What, you don't want to be here? I mean,
you've been sleeping in the staircar

19:03.048 --> 19:05.008
just so we could spend time together.

19:05.092 --> 19:06.844
That's not totally true, though.

19:06.927 --> 19:08.846
I'm just in the middle
of a problem right now.

19:08.929 --> 19:12.349
- Yeah? Well, let's talk about it.
- I can't talk about it with you.

19:12.432 --> 19:13.475
Why not?

19:13.559 --> 19:15.894
It's just, it's about a girl,
and you're not gonna like this.

19:15.978 --> 19:17.938
- Is it about Ann?
- No.

19:18.564 --> 19:20.357
Of course I'm gonna like it.

19:20.440 --> 19:21.984
I like Ann.

19:22.067 --> 19:24.862
No, it's just...

19:25.696 --> 19:27.781
It's a problem without an answer.

19:27.865 --> 19:31.201
Well, every problem has an answer.
You're probably just confused

19:31.285 --> 19:33.745
because you're going
through all of this alone.

19:33.829 --> 19:37.624
And that's exactly
why we need to spend this time together.

19:37.708 --> 19:39.835
- Yeah, I guess so.
- I know so.

19:39.918 --> 19:42.963
So here's the plan. Tomorrow morning
we're gonna get up early.

19:43.046 --> 19:45.966
Before we tell the cops
that Pop-pop escaped from prison,

19:46.049 --> 19:48.886
we're gonna go down to the lake,
we're gonna discuss your girl problem,

19:48.969 --> 19:52.139
and it's gonna be fun,
especially the part about the cops.

19:52.222 --> 19:55.267
All right?
Whatever your problem is with the girl,

19:55.350 --> 19:58.437
we're gonna figure it out.
That's what this place is for.

19:58.520 --> 20:00.480
That and cheating on Gangy.

20:00.564 --> 20:02.566
You know, I'm really glad
you brought me here, Dad.

20:02.649 --> 20:04.484
Yeah, we needed this.

20:04.568 --> 20:07.988
And this time, I'm not gonna let
the family drag me away.

20:08.071 --> 20:12.576
<i>And the next morning, Michael rose early</i>
<i>to spend the day with his son,</i>

20:12.826 --> 20:16.788
<i>only to find himself, once again,</i>
<i>dragged away by his family.</i>

20:18.582 --> 20:21.084
Dad, what the hell are you doing?

20:21.168 --> 20:24.087
Sorry. I can't let you
let Oscar out of prison

20:24.171 --> 20:25.881
or they'll come for me.

20:25.964 --> 20:28.592
How do you like the cabin?

20:37.726 --> 20:40.020
<i>Lucille arrives at the cabin.</i>

20:40.187 --> 20:42.481
...me. There's no cabin.

20:45.525 --> 20:46.777
Mother?

20:46.860 --> 20:51.323
Oh, my God!
Are you still doing breakfast burritos?

20:51.740 --> 20:54.451
<i>Maeby finds someone</i>
<i>to help her forget her cousin.</i>

20:54.534 --> 20:56.286
- Stood up.
- Yeah, me, too.

20:56.370 --> 20:58.205
<i>- Her cousin.</i>
- Wanna make out?

20:58.288 --> 21:00.040
Yeah, sure. Why not?

21:00.874 --> 21:03.126
<i>And Lindsay catches up with Tobias.</i>

21:03.210 --> 21:05.921
Get your hands off my husband, Kitty.

21:06.630 --> 21:08.757
Did someone say "husband"?

21:10.926 --> 21:12.135
I want a divorce.

21:12.219 --> 21:15.847
And I would be thrilled
to represent either one of you.
