WEBVTT

00:01.374 --> 00:03.175
Previously, on <i>Hell's Kitchen.</i>

00:03.243 --> 00:05.010
Trev.
Trev thought he was gone.

00:05.078 --> 00:06.979
Take your jacket off.

00:07.047 --> 00:10.416
But Chef Ramsay
gave him one more chance.

00:10.483 --> 00:13.018
Bye, Trevor.

00:13.086 --> 00:15.554
Then the four men
faced off against four women

00:15.622 --> 00:17.389
in the blind taste test.
What was that?

00:17.457 --> 00:19.158
Russell got the men off
to an early lead.

00:19.225 --> 00:21.794
Grapefruit.
But Rob was hopeless.

00:21.861 --> 00:23.462
Octopus, Chef?

00:23.530 --> 00:24.830
<i>Smoked mussels.</i>

00:24.898 --> 00:26.699
Zero! Zero, bro.

00:26.766 --> 00:29.168
And Nona's outstanding
performance...

00:29.235 --> 00:30.869
Endive?
<i>Three out of four.</i>

00:32.939 --> 00:35.040
Clinched a come-from-behind
victory for the women.

00:35.108 --> 00:37.309
Well done, Nona.
I saved the team!

00:37.377 --> 00:39.778
But after being the hero
in the challenge,

00:39.846 --> 00:41.547
Nona had a miserable night
on meat.

00:41.614 --> 00:44.283
Off!
Get out of my Way.

00:44.351 --> 00:46.352
Get out of my way!
Off upstairs then!

00:46.419 --> 00:48.887
I have so much more to show.

00:48.955 --> 00:50.756
Sabrina rocked
the fish station...

00:50.824 --> 00:52.558
They're nicely colored,
those scallops.

00:52.625 --> 00:53.625
And her best performance yet.

00:53.693 --> 00:54.793
They were perfect.

00:54.861 --> 00:56.562
In the blue kitchen,

00:56.629 --> 00:58.297
Trev did not get any respect
from his teammates.

00:58.365 --> 01:00.532
Gimme a hand with this.
Bro, you're on your own.

01:00.600 --> 01:02.401
But after Rob
screwed up the fish...

01:02.469 --> 01:05.304
I've got no color
on my scallops!

01:05.372 --> 01:07.873
Vinny made a mess
of the spinach...

01:07.941 --> 01:10.709
A big , sweetheart.
Get out!

01:10.777 --> 01:12.277
And Russell undercooked
the chicken...

01:12.345 --> 01:13.912
<i>The chicken's raw!</i>

01:13.980 --> 01:15.881
Chef Ramsay showed
his appreciation for Trev...

01:15.949 --> 01:18.050
Last man standing!

01:18.118 --> 01:19.752
As he was clearly
the best of the worst.

01:19.819 --> 01:21.787
He nominated...
Rob.

01:21.855 --> 01:24.123
And then he decided
to take a run at...
Russell.

01:24.190 --> 01:25.190
<i>You were supposed to be</i>
<i>driving the team tonight,</i>

01:25.258 --> 01:26.692
<i>and you didn't.</i>

01:26.760 --> 01:28.260
Chef Ramsay decided
...

01:28.328 --> 01:29.928
<i>Rob, gimme your jacket.</i>

01:29.996 --> 01:31.597
Putting an end to the dream
of the 36-year-old

01:31.664 --> 01:34.032
law firm Chef from Brooklyn.

And now, the continuation
of <i>Hell's Kitchen.</i>

02:45.505 --> 02:47.306
You gotta talk to me
about this.

02:49.509 --> 02:51.443
Don't think that wasn't
the toughest decision

02:51.511 --> 02:53.412
I've had to make.
Say whatever you want.

02:53.480 --> 02:55.147
I don't care about you, Vinny.
I don't care about you, Trev.

02:55.215 --> 02:57.816
You guys just Me over
so royally bad.

02:59.853 --> 03:02.054
It just got dirty.

03:02.121 --> 03:04.056
Tied me to the train tracks,
I came out alive,

03:04.123 --> 03:06.792
and you are in so much
Trouble, bro.

03:10.096 --> 03:12.798
<i>You need to talk to me</i>
<i>about this.</i>

03:12.866 --> 03:15.934
Whatever.

03:16.002 --> 03:17.669
<i>You know I don't make</i>
<i>the decisions</i>

03:17.737 --> 03:19.605
based on emotion
or anything, Russ.

03:19.672 --> 03:22.608
Everybody knows that was
a strategic move to the fullest.

03:22.675 --> 03:24.943
Russell. He's throwing a temper
tantrum like a little kid.

03:25.011 --> 03:27.145
<i>You were the only one</i>
<i>he screamed and yelled at.</i>

03:27.213 --> 03:29.448
Everybody's got to bring
their "A" game,

03:29.516 --> 03:31.450
and if you think you're just
gonna coast on the fact

03:31.518 --> 03:33.018
that you've been
doing this longer,

03:33.086 --> 03:35.320
guess what--there might be
a changing in a guard.

03:35.388 --> 03:37.022
It might be
my turn to lead.

03:37.090 --> 03:38.223
You needed, you know,
a boot to the ass.

03:38.291 --> 03:39.925
I need a boot in the ass?

03:39.993 --> 03:42.094
<i>Everybody needs to look</i>
<i>around at themselves</i>

03:42.161 --> 03:44.062
before they start looking
at other people.

03:47.967 --> 03:49.768
After another
dinner service victory,

03:49.836 --> 03:51.436
the women are feeling
quite giddy.

03:53.139 --> 03:56.341
The men, not surprisingly,
are feeling quite the opposite.

03:56.409 --> 03:57.809
Inconceivable.

03:57.877 --> 04:00.178
As for Chef Ramsay...

04:00.246 --> 04:03.882
He's concerned about something
he's not seeing on either team.

04:03.950 --> 04:06.251
If there's one issue
I have with all of you,

04:06.319 --> 04:09.922
<i>it's that we do not</i>
<i>communicate enough.</i>

04:09.989 --> 04:12.024
If we don't communicate properly,

04:12.091 --> 04:13.525
<i>your timing will be</i>
<i>way off, right?</i>

04:13.593 --> 04:15.093
Yes, Chef.

04:15.161 --> 04:17.029
Our next challenge
is all about

04:17.096 --> 04:19.164
communication and timing.

04:19.232 --> 04:20.798
We're screwed.

04:20.867 --> 04:22.501
I'm the only one
that communicates.

04:22.569 --> 04:23.869
Trev's a little spineless
rug rat,

04:23.937 --> 04:26.805
and Vinny doesn't
communicate for .

04:26.873 --> 04:28.307
Here's how it works.

04:28.374 --> 04:30.909
<i>As a team,</i>
<i>you'll have 30 minutes</i>

04:30.977 --> 04:32.978
to cook three entrees
from our regular menu.

04:33.046 --> 04:35.247
<i>Here's the catch:</i>
<i>Only one of you</i>

04:35.315 --> 04:37.716
will be in the kitchen
at a time.

04:37.784 --> 04:39.351
<i>When you get in the kitchen,</i>

04:39.419 --> 04:41.119
you start cooking
for five minutes.

04:41.187 --> 04:44.222
<i>When those five minutes</i>
<i>are up,</i>

04:44.290 --> 04:46.625
<i>to communicate</i>
<i>what's been done,</i>

04:46.693 --> 04:48.293
what's working,
what needs to be done

04:48.361 --> 04:49.928
to the next Chef.
Yes, Chef.

04:49.996 --> 04:51.830
I wanted to beat the girls.

04:51.898 --> 04:53.498
We have to lay it all
on the Table.

04:53.566 --> 04:56.335
It's now or never.

04:56.402 --> 04:57.936
Since you have 30 minutes,

04:58.004 --> 04:59.705
<i>blue team,</i>
<i>you all go twice.</i>

04:59.772 --> 05:02.240
Red team, only two of you
will go twice.

05:02.308 --> 05:05.611
<i>Okay, Sabrina and Russell,</i>
<i>meet me in the kitchen.</i>

05:05.678 --> 05:07.579
<i>The rest of you, wait</i>
<i>behind me with your sous Chefs.</i>

05:07.647 --> 05:09.414
Let's go.

05:09.482 --> 05:11.650
In today's communication
relay challenge,

05:11.718 --> 05:13.285
each team will have to prepare
three dishes...

05:19.359 --> 05:21.126
Five minutes,
starting from now.

05:21.194 --> 05:22.728
Off you go!
Come on, Sabrina!

05:22.795 --> 05:24.529
Let's go, Russ!

05:24.597 --> 05:27.599
For this challenge, Chef Ramsay
has selected three dishes

05:27.667 --> 05:30.736
with three completely different
cooking times and techniques.

05:30.803 --> 05:33.205
All right, I'll just
roll out the pasta.

05:33.272 --> 05:36.274
To succeed, the teams
time each dish out precisely...

05:36.342 --> 05:38.810
Set it up for success,
and we're all good to go.

05:38.878 --> 05:41.647
Which can only be accomplished
by great communication.

05:41.714 --> 05:43.849
<i>Come on, Russ!</i>
This is a relay, fellas.

05:43.916 --> 05:46.084
Let's Kill it.

05:47.420 --> 05:49.087
30 seconds to go!
Yes, Chef!

05:49.155 --> 05:50.756
Come on, Sabrina,
you got this.

05:50.823 --> 05:52.257
<i>You better have it</i>
<i>there, girl.</i>

05:52.325 --> 05:54.159
My strategy was
roll out the pasta,

05:54.227 --> 05:55.427
get all the protein going.

05:55.495 --> 05:57.029
Ah! He's alive!

05:57.096 --> 05:58.830
15 seconds.

05:58.898 --> 06:00.599
Ooh, so weird.
Blah.

06:00.667 --> 06:02.267
Uuh!

06:02.335 --> 06:03.568
Sorry!

06:03.636 --> 06:05.037
Sorry?

06:05.104 --> 06:06.872
That five minutes
completely flew by.

06:06.939 --> 06:08.674
Trevor and Julia,
let's go!

06:08.741 --> 06:10.442
The Chefs
must clearly communicate

06:10.510 --> 06:12.177
what they have done
so far.

06:12.245 --> 06:13.912
So this is ready?
Chicken's already poaching.

06:13.980 --> 06:15.781
<i>Pasta's already rolled.</i>
<i>Pasta's rolled?</i>

06:15.848 --> 06:17.582
And what has yet to be done...

06:17.650 --> 06:19.851
It's salmon tagetelli.
In the lobster garnish.

06:19.919 --> 06:22.054
To ensure that all the dishes
are completed correctly

06:22.121 --> 06:23.922
and at the same time,

06:23.990 --> 06:26.224
just as the dinner service orders
should be done.

06:26.292 --> 06:30.262
<i>Out, Russell!</i>
<i>Out, Sabrina, get out!</i>

06:30.329 --> 06:32.064
<i>I'm like, all right,</i>
<i>the first thing I need to do</i>

06:32.131 --> 06:33.632
is get the sauces going.

06:33.700 --> 06:35.067
Come on, Jilly!

06:35.134 --> 06:36.868
So I get
the tagliatelle sauce going.

06:36.936 --> 06:38.203
I get the chicken sauce
going.

06:38.271 --> 06:40.105
I take the lobster out.

06:40.173 --> 06:41.773
I feel like
between me and Sabrina,

06:41.841 --> 06:43.041
we already got half
the work done.

06:43.109 --> 06:43.975
<i>Halfway there, Jillian.</i>

06:44.043 --> 06:44.976
2 1/2 minutes to go.
Trevor.

06:45.044 --> 06:46.912
In'.

06:46.979 --> 06:49.047
Chief, push!
Pushing.

06:49.115 --> 06:50.949
I did a whole bunch
of everything.

06:51.017 --> 06:52.384
Had the pans all lined up
the way I wanted it.

06:52.452 --> 06:53.618
Got the salmon.
Unwrapped the gnocchi.

06:53.686 --> 06:54.886
Last minute to go!

06:54.954 --> 06:56.321
Let's go, Trev!

06:56.389 --> 06:59.091
Green beans off to the side it goes.

06:59.158 --> 07:01.493
Set up for success.
Hand the ball off to Vinny.

07:01.561 --> 07:03.361
And stop!
Go.

07:03.429 --> 07:04.996
<i>Run, Nona!</i>
Come on.

07:05.064 --> 07:06.732
Only thing I didn't do
was cook a lobster.

07:06.799 --> 07:08.700
It's perfectly okay that Trev

07:08.768 --> 07:10.502
didn't start the lobster.

07:10.570 --> 07:13.305
Got your polenta right here.
Got your ragout right here.

07:13.372 --> 07:14.639
Here's your succotash.
This is for your gnocchi.
<i>Get out!</i>

07:14.707 --> 07:16.975
But it's not okay
that he failed

07:17.043 --> 07:18.744
to communicate that
to his teammate.

07:18.811 --> 07:20.645
Come on!
You got everything you need!

07:20.713 --> 07:23.281
So with 20 minutes left,
Vinny turns his attention to...

07:23.349 --> 07:25.050
Vinny, you're not
plating up already, are you?

07:25.118 --> 07:26.218
Yes, Chef.

07:26.285 --> 07:28.153
Oh, the--man!

07:28.221 --> 07:30.355
Meanwhile, in the red kitchen,
Nona forges ahead,

07:30.423 --> 07:32.357
cracking the lobster,
poaching the chicken,

07:32.425 --> 07:34.392
and seasoning the salmon.

07:34.460 --> 07:37.529
I lubed up the salmon
so Gail could come in,

07:37.597 --> 07:39.131
and all she has to do
is put it on the pan.

07:39.198 --> 07:39.965
<i>Stop!</i>

07:43.936 --> 07:45.837
It's round four of six,

07:45.905 --> 07:47.372
and with only 15 minutes left...
Russ!

07:47.440 --> 07:49.741
That towel.

07:49.809 --> 07:51.409
Russell wastes no time...

07:51.477 --> 07:52.611
Let's go, Gail.

07:52.678 --> 07:53.845
While Gail...

07:57.250 --> 07:59.785
Doesn't seem
to accomplish anything.

07:59.852 --> 08:01.920
This bitch didn't put
nothing in.

08:01.988 --> 08:02.954
<i>Stop!</i>

08:03.022 --> 08:04.556
Move! Let's go!

08:04.624 --> 08:06.291
With two rounds to go,

08:06.359 --> 08:08.527
Sabrina finally
gets the salmon cooking.

08:08.594 --> 08:10.962
While in the blue kitchen,
Trev...

08:13.032 --> 08:14.833
Still has not started
the lobster.

08:14.901 --> 08:16.902
Stop! Final turn!
Let's go.

08:16.969 --> 08:19.037
And now, it's up to Vinny
and Jillian

08:19.105 --> 08:21.540
to complete cooking
and plate all three dishes.

08:21.607 --> 08:23.875
Lobster?
No, it's not in here!

08:23.943 --> 08:25.477
Trevor doe
the lobster

08:25.545 --> 08:26.745
for the salmon garnish.

08:26.813 --> 08:28.180
So me thinking
a little

08:28.247 --> 08:30.315
just poach the tail.

08:30.383 --> 08:31.583
Three minutes to go!

08:31.651 --> 08:32.984
Come on, Vinny,
tighten it up!

08:33.052 --> 08:34.219
I got it, guys, I got it!

08:34.287 --> 08:35.486
The chicken dish is done.

08:35.554 --> 08:36.688
The tagliatelle dish is done.

08:36.756 --> 08:38.190
The salmon dish is done.

08:38.256 --> 08:41.559
All I need is
Salmon.

08:41.626 --> 08:43.328
It's not done.
Salmon's not done yet.

08:43.395 --> 08:45.030
30 seconds to go!

08:45.097 --> 08:46.565
<i>Vinny, let's go,</i>
<i>come on!</i>

08:46.632 --> 08:48.233
Come on, Vinny!

08:50.102 --> 08:51.937
There you go.
Thank you.

08:52.004 --> 08:54.973
I gotta plate it.
<i>Four, three...</i>

08:55.041 --> 08:56.341
Oh, no!
What happened?

08:58.010 --> 08:59.044
!

08:59.111 --> 09:00.145
Salmon fell on the floor.

09:00.213 --> 09:03.215
Oh...The salmon

09:03.282 --> 09:05.817
is on the floor.

09:05.885 --> 09:06.785
<i>One...</i>

09:06.853 --> 09:07.853
And stop!

09:14.460 --> 09:17.362
I hope that I didn't make
the red team lose.

09:17.430 --> 09:18.797
Hopefully,
the guys suck, but...

09:18.865 --> 09:20.699
Whatever.

09:22.168 --> 09:24.703
Salmon.
Pass it down, please.

09:28.007 --> 09:30.675
Red team...Oh, dear.

09:32.245 --> 09:33.578
Where's the salmon?

09:33.646 --> 09:36.214
Dropped it
on the floor, Chef.

09:36.282 --> 09:38.316
You dropped them
on the floor.

09:38.384 --> 09:40.552
Yes, Chef.

09:40.620 --> 09:42.754
I just--I've got
no salmon here.

09:42.822 --> 09:45.257
I burned my hand.
That's why I dropped it.

09:45.324 --> 09:46.992
<i>I saw you burn</i>
<i>your hand.</i>

09:47.059 --> 09:50.095
Would you like a medic
to see your hand?

09:52.999 --> 09:55.400
Gail should have been the one
to put that salmon in the oven.

09:55.468 --> 09:57.369
If the salmon would have
been in the oven beforehand,

09:57.436 --> 09:59.237
I wouldn't have been waiting
till the last ten seconds

09:59.305 --> 10:01.273
to bring the
Up to the pass.

10:01.340 --> 10:03.008
Honestly, I'm not fully
to blame for it.

10:03.075 --> 10:04.609
<i>What a shame.</i>

10:04.677 --> 10:06.544
'Cause the actual garnish
tastes delicious.

10:06.612 --> 10:09.080
Thank you, Chef.
<i>Blue team.</i>

10:09.148 --> 10:10.482
<i>Vinny...</i>

10:10.549 --> 10:12.751
Did you season
any of this?

10:12.818 --> 10:14.019
That was all ready
before I went.

10:14.086 --> 10:15.353
I did.
You did.

10:15.421 --> 10:17.756
Salmon, nice and pink.
Nice!

10:19.125 --> 10:20.592
<i>The lobster--</i>
<i>it tastes nice.</i>

10:20.660 --> 10:21.960
<i>Delicious.</i>

10:22.028 --> 10:24.796
Point for the blue team.

10:24.864 --> 10:26.798
The tagliatelle.
Pass it down, please.

10:26.866 --> 10:28.400
<i>Okay. Blue team.</i>

10:29.802 --> 10:31.303
I've got clumps of...
Pasta.

10:34.774 --> 10:37.208
<i>Vinny, did we taste anything</i>
<i>as we were plating it?</i>

10:37.276 --> 10:38.710
I didn't taste
the pasta, no.

10:38.778 --> 10:40.245
It's bland.

10:40.313 --> 10:42.714
<i>There's not an ounce</i>
<i>of seasoning in there.</i>

10:42.782 --> 10:44.950
Red team.

10:47.887 --> 10:50.588
Pasta's slightly drowned...

10:50.656 --> 10:52.257
However,
seasoning perfect.

10:52.325 --> 10:54.459
<i>That is delicious.</i>

10:54.527 --> 10:55.560
Thank you, Chef.

10:55.628 --> 10:57.629
Okay, 1-1.

10:57.697 --> 10:59.564
With the teams tied,

10:59.632 --> 11:01.299
it all comes down to
the chicken with green beans.

11:02.568 --> 11:04.069
<i>Blue team,</i>

11:04.136 --> 11:06.871
nice sear on the chicken.
Gnocchi cooked properly.

11:08.908 --> 11:12.677
My problem's with
the raw beans.

11:12.745 --> 11:14.779
You blanched the beans
in boiling water?
<i>I tossed 'em in.</i>

11:14.847 --> 11:16.848
I thought we were gonna
have enough time

11:16.916 --> 11:18.416
for it to simmer
in the stock.
Did you pass that message on?

11:18.484 --> 11:19.818
I should have said
I didn't blanch 'em--no.

11:19.885 --> 11:21.987
Red team, gnocchi crispy.

11:22.054 --> 11:23.788
<i>Chicken cooked nicely.</i>

11:26.959 --> 11:29.394
I have the same...Issue

11:29.462 --> 11:32.063
with the raw beans.

11:32.131 --> 11:33.431
Who done the beans?

11:33.499 --> 11:35.033
I put it together,
Chef.

11:35.101 --> 11:36.568
I didn't have enough time
to tell Sabrina

11:36.635 --> 11:37.936
everything I wanted to,
and I Up.

11:38.004 --> 11:41.206
Tough call.

11:41.273 --> 11:43.274
<i>Both had raw beans.</i>

11:43.342 --> 11:45.210
And the winning team...
Come on, bro.

11:45.277 --> 11:47.278
Come on, bro.
Come on, bro, come on, bro.

11:47.346 --> 11:50.015
Congratulations...

11:56.866 --> 11:59.401
The score in the communication
relay is tied.

11:59.469 --> 12:01.370
But you both had raw beans.

12:01.438 --> 12:03.205
And the chicken dish
will decide

12:03.273 --> 12:05.074
if the women will continue
their winning ways

12:05.141 --> 12:07.076
or if the men's team
will finally get a victory.

12:07.143 --> 12:08.377
Congratulations.

12:08.445 --> 12:10.379
Ing team is...

12:10.447 --> 12:11.647
The men.

12:11.715 --> 12:12.915
Right!
Let's go!

12:12.982 --> 12:14.750
That's right!
Back again!

12:14.818 --> 12:16.952
Yeah, he's talking to us!
High-five, guys!

12:17.020 --> 12:18.387
That's right!

12:18.455 --> 12:20.022
Gentlemen,
for winning today,

12:20.090 --> 12:22.191
I've arranged for
an amazing reward.

12:22.258 --> 12:24.159
<i>First of all,</i>
<i>a shopping spree</i>

12:24.227 --> 12:25.728
<i>in one of the most</i>
<i>amazing cooking stores.</i>

12:25.795 --> 12:26.862
Sur La Table, yes?

12:26.930 --> 12:28.497
Oh, yeah, buddy!

12:28.565 --> 12:29.932
<i>After that,</i>
<i>you're in for a special treat,</i>

12:29.999 --> 12:32.034
'cause I'm gonna take you

12:32.102 --> 12:34.136
<i>to one of my all-time</i>
<i>favorite restaurants.</i>
Oh, beautiful.

12:34.204 --> 12:34.903
Currently two stars
in michelin guides--

12:34.971 --> 12:36.572
Melisse.

12:36.639 --> 12:38.173
<i>It's amazing.</i>

12:38.241 --> 12:39.675
<i>Well done.</i>
Thank you, Chef.

12:39.743 --> 12:43.011
Uh, ladies,
today is delivery day.

12:43.079 --> 12:45.114
Ohh...

12:45.181 --> 12:47.950
Every time you hear that horn,
run out there

12:48.017 --> 12:49.985
<i>and bring in those deliveries</i>
<i>and put them away.</i>

12:50.053 --> 12:51.553
Deeply sorry
that you dropped the salmon.

12:51.621 --> 12:52.388
Had you got that salmon
on the plate,

12:52.455 --> 12:54.456
you'd be going to Melisse.

12:54.524 --> 12:55.824
Guys, congratulations.

12:55.892 --> 12:57.326
<i>Upstairs. Get dressed.</i>

12:57.394 --> 12:59.161
We're leaving shortly.
Well done, guys.

12:59.229 --> 13:01.864
The monkey's off my back!

13:01.931 --> 13:03.031
Ah!

13:03.099 --> 13:05.000
Stinks.

13:05.068 --> 13:05.968
<i>Jill, how you doing?</i>

13:06.035 --> 13:07.436
I'm fine.

13:07.504 --> 13:14.042
<i>Sabrina, I want you</i>
<i>to get a wet rag</i>

13:14.110 --> 13:16.211
<i>They can't be mad at me</i>
<i>for dropping the salmon</i>

13:16.279 --> 13:17.980
on the ground
'cause I burnt my hand.

13:18.047 --> 13:19.481
And if they are,
then Them.

13:19.549 --> 13:20.682
That salmon
was cooked perfectly.

13:22.252 --> 13:24.553
<i>Ah ha ha!</i>

13:24.621 --> 13:27.189
Later, girls.
<i>Later, ladies.</i>

13:27.257 --> 13:28.557
Off to our reward.

13:28.625 --> 13:30.659
They all look Ugly
anyway.

13:30.727 --> 13:32.494
Trev is ugly.

13:32.562 --> 13:34.696
<i>Trev is a disaster.</i>

13:34.764 --> 13:36.532
Shopping!
Whoo!

13:36.599 --> 13:39.334
I love buyin' stuff!
I love buyin' stuff!

13:39.402 --> 13:41.437
Those bitches!

13:41.504 --> 13:43.806
We get a shopping spree.
We get lunch with Ramsay.

13:43.873 --> 13:46.175
It seems like challenges and me
are goin' together like PB&J.

13:46.242 --> 13:47.876
Nice.

13:47.944 --> 13:49.244
Hey, guys.

13:49.312 --> 13:50.612
<i>James!</i>
<i>Oh, look who it is!</i>

13:50.680 --> 13:52.047
<i>Hey, congratulations!</i>

13:52.115 --> 13:54.049
Welcome to Sur La Table.
Thank you.

13:54.117 --> 13:56.218
Chef Ramsay gave me the cash

13:56.286 --> 13:57.753
for you to buy
whatever you want.

13:57.821 --> 13:58.954
Let's see what we got...

13:59.022 --> 14:00.589
Gotta go, gotta go.

14:00.657 --> 14:03.625
Just grabbing anything
I can get my hands on.

14:03.693 --> 14:05.661
Grab one of these, bro.
Bangin' sharpener.

14:07.797 --> 14:09.164
Thank you.

14:09.232 --> 14:11.233
Go big, bro, or go home.

14:11.301 --> 14:13.635
As the blue team leaves
sur la table content,

14:13.703 --> 14:15.504
back at Hell's Kitchen...
What did Gail even do
in the kitchen?

14:15.572 --> 14:17.573
Something is still
bothering Jillian.

14:17.640 --> 14:21.043
She Up the haricot ver.
She didn't even blanch 'em.

14:21.110 --> 14:23.078
Yeah.
Other than that,
what did she do?

14:23.146 --> 14:24.246
Waste time.
I don't know.

14:24.314 --> 14:26.482
Not put the salmon in.

14:26.549 --> 14:28.283
I don't want to be
the reason we lost.

14:28.351 --> 14:29.952
Hell, yeah,
I'm gonna defend myself.

14:30.019 --> 14:31.820
I'm not gonna take
the full blame for that .

14:31.888 --> 14:33.489
Honestly, no, I'm not.

14:33.556 --> 14:34.957
I think Gail should have
put that On.

14:35.024 --> 14:36.391
Person after me
should have put it on.

14:36.459 --> 14:38.660
That should have been
the last thing she did.

14:38.728 --> 14:39.929
Whatever.

14:39.963 --> 14:43.432
The guys are thanking me
right now at their lunch.

14:43.833 --> 14:44.967
Welcome to Melisse.

14:45.034 --> 14:46.568
Awesome.
Thank you, Chef.

14:47.559 --> 14:49.049
Josiah, good to see you.
Good to have you.

14:49.149 --> 14:49.577
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

14:49.677 --> 14:50.979
<i>One of the best restaurants</i>
<i>in the country.</i>

14:51.116 --> 14:51.652
What is the secret?

14:51.852 --> 14:55.203
Uh, you know, I think it's everyday
<i>"in pursuit of excellence."</i>

14:55.478 --> 14:57.045
<i>Just always striving for that</i>

14:57.113 --> 14:58.480
<i>and try to make it better</i>
<i>than the day before.</i>

14:58.548 --> 15:00.249
Melisse was just awesome.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.751
I mean, this is what
fine dining is all about.

15:02.819 --> 15:04.620
<i>Mmm...That looks fantastic.</i>

15:04.687 --> 15:06.722
So here we have maine scallops
with tagliatelle

15:06.789 --> 15:08.724
and a sea urchin.
Enjoy.

15:08.791 --> 15:09.725
Thank you.
It's delicious.

15:09.792 --> 15:11.293
Josiah Citrin,

15:11.361 --> 15:13.028
his food was straight up
high class.

15:13.096 --> 15:14.229
<i>Chef.</i>
Hmm?

15:14.297 --> 15:15.731
You're sittin' with
the final three.

15:15.798 --> 15:17.399
<i>Congratulations.</i>
<i>Cheers.</i>

15:17.467 --> 15:20.369
Vinny, I can't lift my glass
up to that yet.

15:20.436 --> 15:22.571
Vinny kind of put himself
out there a little too much.

15:22.639 --> 15:24.907
If you're gonna have
all this enthusiasm,

15:24.974 --> 15:26.275
that's great,
but you better back it up.

15:26.342 --> 15:27.442
Anything short of that,

15:27.510 --> 15:28.510
you're lookin' like
a dumbass.

15:28.578 --> 15:29.845
You have some truffle

15:29.913 --> 15:31.380
<i>in your little</i>
<i>Billy goat beard.</i>

15:31.447 --> 15:33.282
<i>There you go.</i>

15:33.349 --> 15:35.350
Vinny is looking forward to
being part of the final three.

15:37.587 --> 15:39.288
He delivery guys.
Let's go!

15:39.355 --> 15:40.589
Awesome.

15:40.657 --> 15:42.558
Meanwhile, the red team
is definitely

15:42.625 --> 15:44.927
not looking forward
to their first deliveries.

15:44.994 --> 15:46.395
We have so much .

15:46.462 --> 15:48.230
<i>Let's get this all moved in.</i>

15:48.298 --> 15:49.898
Uhh. Okay.

15:49.966 --> 15:53.302
This is the one punishment
I did not want to have.

15:53.369 --> 15:55.170
So much There, dude.

15:55.238 --> 15:57.406
Case after case after case.

15:57.473 --> 15:58.507
Whoo!

15:59.609 --> 16:00.509
These bags weigh

16:00.577 --> 16:03.478
almost as much as I do.

16:03.546 --> 16:05.147
This is a definitely
a challenge

16:05.214 --> 16:06.281
the guys should have
Lost.

16:06.349 --> 16:07.282
Yeah, right?

16:07.350 --> 16:09.151
Damn.

16:09.218 --> 16:11.486
♪ Bol bum ♪

16:11.554 --> 16:12.888
they're back.

16:12.956 --> 16:14.189
Let's get somebody
to carry my bags.

16:14.257 --> 16:15.490
Shut up, Trevor.

16:15.558 --> 16:17.092
Not a chance.

16:17.160 --> 16:19.294
If Trevor wins Hell's Kitchen,

16:19.362 --> 16:21.263
I'll never cook
ever again in my life.

16:21.331 --> 16:22.531
Seriously.

16:22.599 --> 16:23.899
Douche bags.

16:25.301 --> 16:26.868
Nona.

16:26.936 --> 16:28.403
Yes, Chef.

16:28.471 --> 16:30.839
Run upstairs right away
and get the guys.

16:30.907 --> 16:32.674
When Chef Scott came down,
I'm like, "oh, man!

16:32.742 --> 16:34.376
This is gonna be bad."

16:34.444 --> 16:36.178
Come on in, fellas.

16:36.245 --> 16:38.180
Hopefully, some of you have
been thinking about dishes

16:38.247 --> 16:39.881
<i>that you've been</i>
<i>wanting to create.</i>

16:39.949 --> 16:42.851
Cause I did receive word
from Chef Ramsay

16:42.919 --> 16:45.387
that the menu
is now yours.

16:45.455 --> 16:47.222
You will be designing
your own menus

16:47.290 --> 16:48.857
for the next dinner service.

16:48.925 --> 16:50.025
<i>Pretty exciting.</i>
Yeah.

16:50.093 --> 16:51.159
I'm excited.

16:51.227 --> 16:52.461
I already have dishes planned

16:52.528 --> 16:54.162
for apps, entree, and dessert.

16:54.230 --> 16:56.365
I want to get these great ideas
on paper right now.

16:56.432 --> 16:57.833
Get upstairs.
Let's go, come on.

16:57.900 --> 16:59.668
<i>Move, move, move.</i>

16:59.736 --> 17:01.303
<i>Move.</i>

17:01.371 --> 17:03.071
Tomorrow,
each team will be tested

17:03.139 --> 17:04.640
not only on their
cooking abilities

17:04.707 --> 17:05.840
but their creative skills
as well.

17:05.907 --> 17:07.809
It's red menu versus blue menu.

17:07.877 --> 17:09.845
Anybody got an idea
for apps?

17:09.912 --> 17:12.146
Yeah. Ricotta raviolis.
I like that.

17:12.214 --> 17:14.082
Each team will come up
with four appetizers...

17:14.150 --> 17:16.117
We can do some sort
of greek salad.

17:16.185 --> 17:18.119
Four entrees,
and four desserts

17:18.186 --> 17:20.222
that are worthy of being
served in Hell's Kitchen.

17:20.289 --> 17:21.723
I got ideas for apps.

17:21.790 --> 17:22.790
We can do sweet
and sour rock shrimp.

17:22.858 --> 17:24.393
Ehh...That doesn't--

17:24.460 --> 17:25.827
I don't like that.

17:25.895 --> 17:27.295
We can do like
a cold smoked duck dish.

17:27.363 --> 17:28.830
Cold duck?

17:28.898 --> 17:30.632
Might not be
a good idea.

17:30.700 --> 17:32.367
I've worked in fine dining
longer than Russell has.

17:32.435 --> 17:34.503
If Russell says something
I don't like,

17:34.570 --> 17:36.505
whether he likes it or not,
we're not gonna do it.

17:36.572 --> 17:39.241
Oh, I got it.
Gazpacho.

17:39.308 --> 17:41.276
I love gazpacho.

17:41.344 --> 17:42.911
We're doing
the salad.
<i>Of what?</i>

17:42.979 --> 17:44.379
Strawberry vinaigrette
with greens.

17:44.447 --> 17:46.114
It's easy.
Yes, I agree.

17:46.182 --> 17:47.949
Let's move on.
I got ideas.

17:48.017 --> 17:49.251
We'll finish that later.

17:51.521 --> 17:53.989
Dude, we should do
linguini with clams.

17:54.057 --> 17:56.224
Bluuh.
I don't think
that that's a good idea.

17:56.292 --> 17:58.126
We need to
Win tomorrow night.

17:58.194 --> 18:01.029
We have filet mignon.
New York strip.

18:01.097 --> 18:03.031
Yeah, dude, that'd be
Good!

18:03.099 --> 18:05.233
Duck with lentils

18:05.301 --> 18:07.602
is like classic,
like straight up.

18:07.670 --> 18:09.171
Sometimes I just feel like

18:09.238 --> 18:10.439
what's the point
of even speaking,

18:10.506 --> 18:11.173
because nobody
listens to me.

18:11.240 --> 18:12.541
Kung pow calamari.

18:12.608 --> 18:14.109
Kung pao calamari.
<i>Kung pao calamari. Ooh!</i>

18:14.177 --> 18:16.611
I didn't think
that our menu was fine dining.

18:16.679 --> 18:18.480
I wasn't impressed.

18:18.548 --> 18:20.115
Mwah!

18:20.183 --> 18:22.117
Damn, we're good.

18:22.185 --> 18:23.885
I was even thinking
swordfish rossini.

18:23.953 --> 18:25.620
No.
I don't really like swordfish.

18:25.688 --> 18:27.255
<i>You guys come up with</i>
<i>some entrees.</i>

18:27.323 --> 18:29.091
You need to come up
with something.

18:29.158 --> 18:30.692
What do you guys think
of doing a striped bass?

18:30.760 --> 18:32.294
There ya go.
I like that.

18:32.361 --> 18:33.628
I'm sick of these two
punk ass bitches.

18:33.696 --> 18:35.363
You're not a better cook
than me.

18:35.431 --> 18:36.965
You're not more creative
than me...Period.

18:37.033 --> 18:38.500
Awesome.
I'm so excited.

18:38.568 --> 18:40.035
<i>Bada bing!</i>

18:40.103 --> 18:41.970
With the biggest test so far

18:42.038 --> 18:43.872
for each kitchen ahead of them,

18:43.940 --> 18:46.174
the Chefs decide
to knock off early.

18:47.777 --> 18:50.011
But there are two Chefs
who prefer another option.

18:52.000 --> 18:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

19:00.056 --> 19:03.658
All of this fun
doesn't sit well with Russell...

19:07.430 --> 19:10.832
Who, before he attacks,
decides to listen in.

19:32.321 --> 19:33.155
!

19:36.913 --> 19:37.963
It's the night before

19:38.063 --> 19:39.777
the most important
dinner service yet.

19:43.125 --> 19:44.892
And Trev and Vinny
are having

19:44.960 --> 19:46.861
a private conversation
about Russell's attitude...

19:52.434 --> 19:54.001
That is no longer private.

19:59.007 --> 20:00.274
We went over
the entire menu again.

20:00.342 --> 20:02.176
Yeah.

20:02.244 --> 20:03.344
These
Are runnin' their mouth.

20:03.411 --> 20:04.478
Trev's wasted,

20:04.546 --> 20:06.080
and Vinny's half in the bag too.

20:06.148 --> 20:07.548
I'm gonna
Smoke you guys.

20:10.619 --> 20:12.286
Russ--let
Get all pissed off.

20:12.354 --> 20:14.121
I really don't care.
It's funny.

20:17.826 --> 20:20.227
The more pissed off he gets,
the more I'm smiling, so...

20:28.203 --> 20:30.604
As a new day begins
in Hell's Kitchen,

20:30.672 --> 20:32.806
once again, there's no rest
for the weary...

20:32.874 --> 20:34.542
Fellas, time to get up.

20:34.609 --> 20:36.177
Or the hung over.

20:40.248 --> 20:42.082
Because in a few short hours,

20:42.150 --> 20:45.152
the Chefs will be debuting
the menus they designed.

20:45.220 --> 20:46.921
Good morning, Chef.
Morning.

20:46.988 --> 20:48.722
<i>You guys need to work</i>
<i>really fast,</i>

20:48.790 --> 20:49.590
'cause you're pretty much
starting from scratch.

20:51.927 --> 20:54.895
Come on, guys.
We gotta do this.

20:54.963 --> 20:57.231
There's a lot to get done,

20:57.299 --> 20:59.200
but I hope that I can
knock it out of the ball park.

20:59.267 --> 21:01.302
Excited about the menu?
Hell, yeah.

21:01.369 --> 21:07.341
While the red team is confident
in their menu,

21:08.777 --> 21:09.944
Trev!

21:10.011 --> 21:11.478
You're boiling
the cream over.

21:14.816 --> 21:16.116
You're hung over,

21:16.184 --> 21:18.118
and if you guys
keep dragging ass,

21:18.186 --> 21:20.154
I will break somebody off
something real proper-like.

21:20.222 --> 21:23.123
Okay, let's go, ladies, quickly.
Yes, Chef.

21:23.191 --> 21:25.626
Let's go, guys, please.
Yes, Chef.

21:25.694 --> 21:27.161
Uh, red team, blue team.

21:27.229 --> 21:29.363
Clearly, your menu--
my standards.

21:29.431 --> 21:30.564
Yes, Chef.
Yes, Chef.

21:30.632 --> 21:32.866
Right, James.

21:32.934 --> 21:34.034
<i>Open Hell's Kitchen, please.</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>
Yes, Chef.

21:49.017 --> 21:50.751
Yeah, big night tonight.
Let's go.

21:50.819 --> 21:52.319
The red menu versus blue menu

21:52.387 --> 21:56.924
has always been a critical
dinner service in the past.

21:56.992 --> 21:58.759
Every customer
will have the choice

21:58.827 --> 22:00.761
of ordering off the red menu
or the blue.

22:00.829 --> 22:02.329
We got this, ladies.
Let's kick some Booty tonight.

22:02.397 --> 22:03.864
Let's do it!

22:03.932 --> 22:06.333
The red team's menu
features...

22:09.371 --> 22:12.139
And New York strip
with sauteed cauliflower.

22:12.207 --> 22:14.208
Let's get this
Ball rolling.

22:14.276 --> 22:16.777
The blue team's menu features
whipped ricotta ravioli,

22:16.845 --> 22:19.313
roasted sea bass
with fingerling potatoes,

22:19.381 --> 22:22.316
and grilled lamb chops
with white bean puree.

22:22.384 --> 22:23.751
Once they start seeing
our dishes,

22:23.818 --> 22:25.185
they're gonna sell.

22:25.253 --> 22:27.054
Both kitchens are eager

22:27.122 --> 22:29.123
to see which team's menu
the diners prefer.

22:29.190 --> 22:33.127
Order in, Chefs.
Okay, here we go.

22:33.194 --> 22:35.162
On order,
two away, table 33--

22:35.230 --> 22:36.764
nothing at all.

22:39.367 --> 22:40.868
Away now, one calamari,
one risotto, yes?

22:40.935 --> 22:42.503
Yes, Chef!
Yes, Chef.

22:42.570 --> 22:44.371
Nothing to do with the blue.
Let's go with that.

22:44.439 --> 22:45.673
While Nona gets started

22:45.740 --> 22:46.640
on the red team's
first appetizers,

22:46.708 --> 22:48.008
out in the dining room...

22:48.076 --> 22:49.343
Let's start with
the red team.

22:49.411 --> 22:51.078
I'm gonna go red too.
The red.

22:51.146 --> 22:52.913
A pattern is quickly emerging.

22:52.981 --> 22:54.615
Order in Chef.
Two top, all red.

22:54.683 --> 22:57.051
I'm gonna go for red as well.
Red it is.

22:57.118 --> 22:59.620
All the appetizers,
all on the red team.

22:59.688 --> 23:01.322
<i>Nothing on the blue team.</i>
Wow.

23:01.389 --> 23:03.290
What the Is goin' on?

23:03.358 --> 23:05.859
Again--all red!
Nothing in the blue.

23:05.927 --> 23:07.428
What the ?

23:07.495 --> 23:09.463
What the hell's goin' on?

23:09.531 --> 23:10.964
They didn't want
anything to do with us.

23:11.032 --> 23:12.966
And it made us feel about...

23:13.034 --> 23:14.935
This big.

23:15.003 --> 23:17.538
While most of the diners
are favoring the red menu,

23:17.605 --> 23:18.872
one special guest...

23:18.940 --> 23:20.341
I think
the grilled lamb chop,

23:20.408 --> 23:22.376
medium-rare.

23:22.444 --> 23:24.478
Has arrived
with a specific intention

23:24.546 --> 23:27.348
of ordering from the people
who he looked after yesterday.

23:27.415 --> 23:29.483
Watch this table--
Josiah, the owner of Melisse.

23:29.551 --> 23:31.752
Don't make me look
Stupid.

23:31.753 --> 23:34.254
<i>One ravioli.</i>
<i>Entree, one lamb chop.</i>

23:34.322 --> 23:36.490
How long is gonna take you
to get a Lamb up, buddy?

23:36.558 --> 23:38.258
One lamb chop working.

23:38.326 --> 23:41.095
Josiah treated us
with great respect yesterday.

23:41.162 --> 23:43.364
He really took care of us,
and we need to return the favor.

23:43.431 --> 23:45.499
Vinny, we gotta make this
Happen, bro.

23:45.567 --> 23:47.901
While the blue team
hopes to impress Chef Citrin...

23:47.969 --> 23:48.902
Risotto.

23:48.970 --> 23:50.504
Walking with risotto.

23:50.572 --> 23:53.140
Nona hopes to impress
Chef Ramsay.

23:57.879 --> 23:59.279
<i>Nona!</i>

23:59.347 --> 24:00.748
It's undercooked!

24:00.815 --> 24:02.549
<i>You need to cook the rice</i>

24:02.617 --> 24:04.752
longer in the stock--
it's undercooked.

24:04.819 --> 24:06.987
Yes, Chef.

24:07.055 --> 24:09.223
It's super-important to come
out of the gate strong,

24:09.290 --> 24:11.058
or else it Up
the whole dinner service.

24:11.126 --> 24:12.860
Wake up, wake up,
wake up, wake up.

24:12.927 --> 24:14.862
I'm not here
to wipe your little butt.

24:14.929 --> 24:16.497
<i>Let's get that right!</i>

24:16.564 --> 24:18.165
Plus, it put Chef Ramsay
in a Mood,

24:18.233 --> 24:20.667
and then he's gonna be
up our All night.

24:20.735 --> 24:22.202
<i>Come on, risotto.</i>
<i>Quickly, let's go.</i>

24:22.270 --> 24:24.271
Yes, Chef.
Walking with risotto.

24:24.339 --> 24:27.174
Down, down, down.

24:27.242 --> 24:28.275
<i>Nona!</i>

24:29.511 --> 24:31.578
Very good, that risotto.
Yes, Chef.

24:31.646 --> 24:33.147
With her opening mistake
behind her,

24:33.214 --> 24:35.716
Nona has the appetizer station
under control.

24:35.784 --> 24:37.885
Risotto's delicious.
Service, go.

24:37.952 --> 24:39.586
And food is rolling
out of the kitchen.

24:39.654 --> 24:40.821
Go.

24:40.889 --> 24:42.289
Meanwhile,
in the blue kitchen...

24:42.357 --> 24:43.457
Order in, Chef.
All blue.

24:43.525 --> 24:45.025
All blue. 'Bout time.

24:45.093 --> 24:46.994
Orders are finally coming in.

24:47.061 --> 24:48.095
Thank God!

24:48.163 --> 24:49.630
All for the blue team.

24:49.697 --> 24:51.732
One bisque, one ravioli,
entree, two fillet.

24:51.800 --> 24:53.934
Yes, Chef.
It's one thing
to not get orders,

24:54.002 --> 24:55.536
but it's another thing not to
be able to execute the orders.

24:55.603 --> 24:57.771
Getting us off
to a positive start, Chef.

24:57.839 --> 24:59.573
'Cause if we make
our food perfectly,

24:59.641 --> 25:01.141
we have a chance--
we beat the girls.

25:01.209 --> 25:02.443
Let's go.
Bisque and ravioli.

25:05.780 --> 25:07.748
Right hand, sir.

25:07.816 --> 25:10.350
<i>Russell. Excellent.</i>
Thank you, Chef.

25:10.418 --> 25:12.553
Keep it going, Russell, yes?
Keep it going.

25:12.620 --> 25:14.788
Yes, Chef.
<i>Service, please.</i>

25:14.856 --> 25:16.523
With both kitchens
sending appetizers...

25:16.591 --> 25:17.991
Bon appetit.
Thank you.

25:18.059 --> 25:20.160
Away now,
one lamb, one bass.

25:20.228 --> 25:21.995
Yes, Chef.

25:22.063 --> 25:24.231
Chef Ramsay is ready
to send out entrees.

25:24.299 --> 25:26.400
Where's your lamb.
Is it in?
Lamb?

25:26.468 --> 25:28.735
Unfortunately,
Vinny is not.

25:28.803 --> 25:30.504
Vin, you got
a lamb chop pulled?

25:30.572 --> 25:33.740
You need a lamb
for this order?
Yeah.

25:35.910 --> 25:37.878
I forgot it completely.

25:37.946 --> 25:39.213
Where's the lamb?

25:39.280 --> 25:40.781
Six minutes
on a lamb, Chef.

25:42.350 --> 25:43.383
<i>What?!</i>

25:43.451 --> 25:44.918
You forgot the lamb!
Yes.

25:44.986 --> 25:46.119
Oh, No.

25:46.187 --> 25:48.121
I forgot the lamb, Chef.

25:48.189 --> 25:49.289
That lamb...

25:49.357 --> 25:51.725
Was for Josiah Citrin's table.

25:53.094 --> 25:55.095
James. Come in.

25:57.198 --> 25:58.732
There's the Lamb.

25:58.800 --> 26:00.367
<i>It's still got</i>
<i>its fur on there.</i>

26:00.435 --> 26:02.069
You know who this guy
is, yeah?

26:02.136 --> 26:02.970
I know who this guy is,
and I am very sorry.

26:03.037 --> 26:04.204
You ate in his restaurant.

26:04.272 --> 26:05.539
<i>How long are we out?</i>

26:05.607 --> 26:07.140
About five minutes.

26:07.208 --> 26:08.809
<i>Of all the tables,</i>

26:08.877 --> 26:10.744
Josiah Citrin!

26:10.812 --> 26:12.145
I'm very sorry.

26:12.213 --> 26:13.514
Yeah, Right,
you will be.

26:13.581 --> 26:15.282
Oh, dude, you're killing me.

26:15.350 --> 26:16.717
And not only
are you killing me,

26:16.784 --> 26:18.552
you're killing yourself, bro.

26:18.620 --> 26:20.287
Chef Ramsay
sends his apologies.

26:20.355 --> 26:22.523
<i>I do apologize.</i>

26:22.590 --> 26:25.659
For the love of God, please
be Cooking right.

26:25.727 --> 26:27.327
Oh, .

26:27.395 --> 26:29.563
The Lamb. Josiah.
The lamb. How long?

26:29.631 --> 26:30.964
<i>Lamb!</i>

26:31.032 --> 26:32.132
<i>I am bringing it up</i>
<i>right now, Chef.</i>

26:37.839 --> 26:39.172
Lamb's still not ready.

26:39.240 --> 26:40.073
UnBelievable.

26:44.345 --> 26:46.847
Vinny! Are you
Kidding me?

26:46.915 --> 26:49.082
<i>With a man like that</i>
<i>with his reputation,</i>

26:49.150 --> 26:51.685
are you Serious?

26:51.753 --> 26:53.453
<i>Oh, come on!</i>

26:53.521 --> 26:55.055
Don't serve it
if it ain't right.

26:55.123 --> 26:56.223
And you should
know better, Vinny.

26:56.291 --> 26:57.524
If my lamb was here,

26:57.592 --> 26:59.226
those guys wouldn't
be getting yelled at.

26:59.294 --> 27:01.728
It's still Walking!
Look at it!

27:01.796 --> 27:04.565
I love it.
Get 'em, Chef!

27:04.632 --> 27:06.166
This is a car crash!

27:06.234 --> 27:08.302
<i>Trev, Russell,</i>

27:08.369 --> 27:09.603
<i>Vinny...</i>

27:09.671 --> 27:11.672
Do something!

27:11.739 --> 27:13.740
What the
Going on?

27:13.808 --> 27:15.242
<i>Come on, Vinny,</i>
<i>just get it back together!</i>

27:24.307 --> 27:25.874
Tonight in Hell's Kitchen,
it's the red menu

27:25.941 --> 27:27.575
versus the blue menu.

27:27.643 --> 27:29.311
And unfortunately...

27:29.378 --> 27:30.979
Are you Kidding me?

27:31.047 --> 27:32.447
Vinny's attempt to impress

27:32.515 --> 27:34.716
two-michelin star Chef
Josiah Citrin...

27:34.784 --> 27:36.318
<i>With a man like that,</i>
<i>with his reputation,</i>

27:36.385 --> 27:38.019
are you Serious?

27:38.087 --> 27:39.487
Has turned into a disaster.

27:39.555 --> 27:41.890
This is a car crash!

27:41.957 --> 27:45.260
<i>Trev, Russell, Vinny...</i>

27:45.328 --> 27:47.295
Do something!

27:47.363 --> 27:49.397
What the
Is going on?

27:49.465 --> 27:50.965
<i>Come on, Vinny,</i>
<i>just get it back together.</i>

27:51.033 --> 27:52.233
<i>Let's go!</i>

27:52.301 --> 27:54.302
Scoot down.
Let Russ take the meats.

27:54.370 --> 27:55.837
Get this
in the oven.

27:55.905 --> 27:58.106
Meat has to be
the easiest station.

27:58.174 --> 27:59.607
Pull up.

27:59.675 --> 28:01.609
Dude, it's a disaster
over here.
I know.

28:01.677 --> 28:03.778
It, I'll do it.
Get out of the way.

28:03.846 --> 28:05.780
If you don't want to do it
right, then let me do it.

28:05.848 --> 28:07.282
Thanks to Russell...

28:07.350 --> 28:08.917
We apologize,
and seriously,

28:08.984 --> 28:10.685
I'm too embarrassed,
you know...

28:10.753 --> 28:13.188
Chef Citrin has finally
received his lamb chops.

28:13.255 --> 28:15.490
Chef Ramsay apologizes.

28:15.558 --> 28:17.392
Meanwhile,
back in the red kitchen...

28:17.460 --> 28:19.327
Lobster.
Yes, Chef, coming up
right now

28:19.395 --> 28:20.795
in five seconds.

28:20.863 --> 28:22.530
Come on, Gail, please.
<i>Yes, Chef!</i>

28:22.598 --> 28:24.432
The women have also moved on
to entrees

28:24.500 --> 28:26.234
and are looking to Gail
to come through

28:26.302 --> 28:28.470
on her first
lobster capellini.

28:28.537 --> 28:30.572
Gail.

28:30.639 --> 28:32.173
Yes, Chef.
Look, look.

28:32.241 --> 28:33.942
<i>It's raw on the inside.</i>

28:34.009 --> 28:36.211
That is raw.
Touch. It's raw.
Yes, Chef.

28:36.278 --> 28:37.746
Come on,
take the whole thing back.

28:37.813 --> 28:39.514
Hurry up, Gail.
Chef, yes, Chef.

28:39.582 --> 28:41.816
Gail's Up lobster,

28:41.884 --> 28:43.952
and you It up once,
you figure it out.

28:44.019 --> 28:45.520
They are overcooked now.

28:45.588 --> 28:47.155
It's solid!
Yes, Chef.

28:47.223 --> 28:48.690
You It up twice,
you figure it out.

28:48.758 --> 28:50.625
What
three times...

28:50.693 --> 28:51.960
Gail!
Four times...

28:52.027 --> 28:53.294
That is raw.
Five times...

28:53.362 --> 28:54.596
Gail!
Six times!

28:54.663 --> 28:57.399
Every Table's the same!

28:57.466 --> 28:59.134
Like, come on, Gail.
Get it together.

28:59.201 --> 29:00.602
Go. Come back for the lobster.
Come on!

29:00.669 --> 29:01.903
Yes, Chef!

29:01.971 --> 29:04.038
An hour and a half
into dinner service,

29:04.106 --> 29:05.840
and with diners
at the same table

29:05.908 --> 29:08.376
ordering food
from both kitchens...

29:08.444 --> 29:11.045
Everything's here except
for your lobster tail.

29:11.113 --> 29:13.381
Red diners are going hungry.

29:13.449 --> 29:14.482
I'm staring
at everybody else's table.

29:17.720 --> 29:20.789
While blue diners
are receiving their entrees.

29:20.856 --> 29:22.323
Ha ha, you guys
aren't eating.

29:23.526 --> 29:27.061
But not all of them are happy.

29:28.497 --> 29:29.597
How is it?

29:29.665 --> 29:30.965
The main course,
no good.

29:31.033 --> 29:32.600
It's overcooked.
It's vealy.

29:32.668 --> 29:33.868
It's horrible.

29:33.936 --> 29:36.104
James.

29:36.172 --> 29:37.272
How's Josiah?

29:37.339 --> 29:38.907
Really, really unhappy.

29:40.309 --> 29:41.743
<i>All of you,</i>

29:41.811 --> 29:43.711
so you Go there,
you grace his table.

29:43.779 --> 29:45.346
He looks after you.

29:45.414 --> 29:47.649
He comes in here,
and look at the treatment.

29:49.385 --> 29:51.085
No, I haven't.

29:51.153 --> 29:53.121
There's a guy out there
with two michelin stars,

29:53.189 --> 29:55.423
and look at us now,
like a bunch of .

29:55.491 --> 29:56.458
<i>Well done.</i>

29:56.525 --> 29:58.626
Unbelievable.

29:58.694 --> 30:00.094
Disappointed with the blue team,

30:00.162 --> 30:02.330
Chef Ramsay looks to Sabrina,

30:02.398 --> 30:04.332
hoping she can give him
some good news.

30:04.400 --> 30:05.767
One New York strip.
How long?

30:07.069 --> 30:08.036
Or any news at all.

30:08.103 --> 30:09.337
Sabrina.

30:10.906 --> 30:13.441
Sabrina.
Um...Yeah.

30:13.509 --> 30:15.944
Answer me,
you ignorant cow!

30:16.011 --> 30:17.712
<i>One minute?</i>
<i>Sorry, Chef.</i>

30:17.780 --> 30:19.047
<i>Come on, Sabrina!</i>

30:19.114 --> 30:20.882
Sabrina...
Where are you?

30:20.950 --> 30:23.885
Where are you?
Get in the game!

30:28.123 --> 30:30.124
<i>Oh, Sabrina.</i>

30:30.192 --> 30:32.026
Damn...

30:32.094 --> 30:36.164
Did I not do that right?
What's up, Chef Ramsay?

30:36.232 --> 30:38.233
<i>Keep it going. Let's go.</i>
<i>Yes, Chef!</i>

30:38.300 --> 30:41.135
Thank you, Chef.

30:41.203 --> 30:42.403
Go, quickly.

30:42.404 --> 30:44.472
It's two hours

30:44.540 --> 30:47.075
and with Sabrina mastering
the meat station...

30:47.142 --> 30:49.811
You said four minutes, I give it
to you in two minutes, Chef.

30:49.879 --> 30:51.813
Entrees are making their way
to the red diners,

30:51.881 --> 30:53.515
while in the blue kitchen...

30:53.582 --> 30:55.116
Bass. Let's go.
Yes, Chef.

30:55.184 --> 30:56.918
After a disappointing
performance on meat,

30:56.986 --> 30:58.853
Vinny is getting
another chance...

30:58.921 --> 31:00.688
This time
on the fish station.

31:00.756 --> 31:01.890
<i>Come on, vin, you got it.</i>

31:04.093 --> 31:06.528
I Up the meat station.
To save my ass,

31:06.595 --> 31:07.996
I'm gonna need to save
the day on fish.

31:08.063 --> 31:10.298
<i>Where's the bass?</i>

31:12.401 --> 31:14.035
Look at that. Look.

31:20.042 --> 31:21.509
This is not possible.

31:21.577 --> 31:23.378
Huh?

31:23.445 --> 31:25.580
That's what I get--
come here, all of you.

31:25.648 --> 31:27.382
He brings that pissing over.

31:27.449 --> 31:29.117
And the big surprise is

31:29.184 --> 31:33.254
the Bass
is Raw!

31:33.322 --> 31:35.356
What the
Is going on?

31:35.424 --> 31:37.792
I'm gonna get
through this, Chef.

31:39.261 --> 31:41.296
Gonna get through it.

31:41.363 --> 31:43.731
Vinny has dug a deeper
hole for himself.

31:43.799 --> 31:46.134
Two salmon, one lobster.
Right here, Chef.

31:46.201 --> 31:48.503
Meanwhile, in the red kitchen...
<i>You walking, Gail?</i>

31:48.571 --> 31:50.471
G?
No, she's Sinking.

31:50.539 --> 31:52.974
Gail is under pressure
to deliver

31:53.042 --> 31:54.809
a properly cooked
lobster capellini

31:54.877 --> 31:58.880
after six unsuccessful tries.

31:58.948 --> 32:01.049
Gail!

32:01.116 --> 32:03.184
Ot raw pasta,

32:03.252 --> 32:04.786
and look at it--
it's standing up straight.

32:04.853 --> 32:05.820
<i>Look, madame.</i>

32:05.888 --> 32:07.522
It's like a Thong

32:07.590 --> 32:09.357
left over from a
Night out in Vegas.

32:09.425 --> 32:11.659
Come on!
All of you...

32:11.727 --> 32:14.329
Just taste that, will you?
Taste it.

32:14.396 --> 32:15.930
Taste it.

32:15.998 --> 32:20.535
<i>That's what you're sending me.</i>
<i>Taste it.</i>

32:20.603 --> 32:22.470
Bad night.
Bad night for me.

32:22.538 --> 32:25.340
Hold on, hey!
It gets worse.

32:25.407 --> 32:27.208
<i>Touch that!</i>

32:27.276 --> 32:29.177
Rubber.
It's raw.

32:29.244 --> 32:31.946
Every lobster
you've sent me tonight

32:32.014 --> 32:34.148
has been undercooked,
overcooked,

32:34.216 --> 32:35.283
undercooked, overcooked.

32:35.351 --> 32:37.685
Now it's Raw.

32:37.753 --> 32:39.554
<i>Look at me.</i>
<i>Get out.</i>

32:39.622 --> 32:41.656
Yes, Chef.
Get out!

32:41.724 --> 32:43.224
<i>Get out!</i>

32:50.264 --> 32:52.165
It's 2 1/2 hours into
the red versus blue

32:52.233 --> 32:53.766
dinner service,

32:53.834 --> 32:55.802
and after Gail's seventh
failed attempt

32:55.870 --> 32:57.770
to cook an acceptable
lobster capellini...

32:57.838 --> 33:00.406
Now it's Raw!

33:00.474 --> 33:02.642
Chef Ramsay has had enough.

33:02.710 --> 33:04.043
Get out.
Yes, Chef.

33:04.111 --> 33:05.745
Get out!

33:05.813 --> 33:07.313
<i>Get out.</i>

33:09.350 --> 33:13.052
Fish and garokay, Chef.

33:13.120 --> 33:14.654
That Lobster.

33:14.722 --> 33:16.523
I failed my team.
I failed Chef Ramsay.

33:16.590 --> 33:17.724
So, um, it hurts.

33:20.361 --> 33:22.729
There's no crying
in the kitchen.

33:22.796 --> 33:25.732
While Gail attempts to pull
herself together in the dorms,

33:25.799 --> 33:27.734
back in the kitchen,
the women pull together

33:27.801 --> 33:29.135
to complete dinner service.

33:29.203 --> 33:30.904
I'm dragging one lobster.

33:30.971 --> 33:32.105
<i>Right now, Chef.</i>

33:32.173 --> 33:33.773
We got this.
Come on.

33:33.841 --> 33:35.909
Soon as this goes out,
we can go with the next one.

33:35.910 --> 33:37.510
<i>One lobster, o</i>

33:37.578 --> 33:40.180
your last table.

33:40.247 --> 33:41.981
Last ticket, guys.
Come on.

33:42.049 --> 33:43.550
Yes, Chef.
Push it out.

33:43.617 --> 33:44.918
Garnish is ready.

33:44.985 --> 33:46.119
Garnish is ready.
We can walk.

33:46.187 --> 33:47.654
Let's go.

33:47.721 --> 33:49.455
Up to the window right now.

33:49.523 --> 33:51.057
Please go.
Let's go.

33:52.860 --> 33:55.762
I am not happy.

33:55.829 --> 33:58.431
<i>Tonight should have</i>
<i>gone better.</i>

33:58.499 --> 34:02.001
There's no winning team.

34:02.069 --> 34:04.237
<i>Tomorrow, you will</i>
<i>become one team.</i>

34:04.305 --> 34:06.940
I want all of you

34:07.007 --> 34:10.076
to think about
the one individual

34:10.143 --> 34:12.779
<i>that you think</i>
<i>doesn't belong</i>

34:12.846 --> 34:15.415
in the final six.

34:15.482 --> 34:17.150
Clear?
Yes, Chef.

34:17.217 --> 34:18.518
Get out.

34:18.585 --> 34:20.253
As the two teams

34:20.321 --> 34:22.121
will become one after tonight,

34:22.188 --> 34:24.090
Chef Ramsay has taken
the unprecedented step

34:24.158 --> 34:26.391
of asking the Chefs
to nominate anyone,

34:26.460 --> 34:28.795
no matter what team
they're currently on.

34:28.862 --> 34:31.231
You want me to start?
<i>Yeah.</i>

34:31.297 --> 34:33.366
Honestly,
the last two or three services

34:33.434 --> 34:36.168
have been absolutely atrocious.

34:36.237 --> 34:38.036
It's not like
it's getting better.

34:38.105 --> 34:39.606
It's getting worse.

34:39.672 --> 34:41.074
I absolutely
beyond the shadow of a doubt

34:41.141 --> 34:44.043
feel I've earned
my spot in the finals.

34:44.110 --> 34:46.145
Russell clear as day knows

34:46.213 --> 34:48.081
that I'm his biggest
competition here.

34:48.148 --> 34:50.216
Starts throwing in
a bunch of dirty comments

34:50.284 --> 34:52.485
to try to get me outta here--
that really pissed me off.

34:52.553 --> 34:57.190
Everyone here has heart
and love and drive and passion,

34:57.258 --> 35:00.693
with the exception
of Sabrina.

35:00.761 --> 35:02.528
I wouldn't put Sabrina up
at all,

35:02.596 --> 35:03.863
<i>because I think</i>
<i>she's done great.</i>

35:03.931 --> 35:05.598
Tonight Gail got kicked out,

35:05.666 --> 35:07.500
<i>but everybody has</i>
<i>Service.</i>

35:07.568 --> 35:09.469
<i>If I had to pick one person,</i>

35:09.536 --> 35:12.138
I think I would
have to pick Trev.

35:12.206 --> 35:14.173
<i>Sorry, but..</i>

35:14.241 --> 35:18.678
I just don't see that you
could actually win this.

35:18.746 --> 35:20.480
Wow.

35:20.547 --> 35:22.515
I think it's difficult
to work with you.

35:22.583 --> 35:25.084
He's Everybody.

35:25.152 --> 35:27.587
There's no way he's gonna be
part of the final six.

35:27.655 --> 35:29.155
<i>I see amazing potential</i>
<i>in me,</i>

35:29.223 --> 35:32.158
and I can only go higher.

35:32.226 --> 35:33.693
How could you possibly
not want me on your team?

35:33.761 --> 35:35.528
It seems pretty petty.

35:35.596 --> 35:37.563
I'm an asset, no matter
which way you slice it.

35:37.631 --> 35:39.732
I think youse are wrong
for picking Trevor.

35:39.800 --> 35:41.434
<i>I'm not gonna put up</i>
<i>my girls,</i>

35:41.502 --> 35:43.636
'cause they've done
Awesome, so...

35:55.582 --> 35:57.817
Let's start with...Russell.

35:57.885 --> 35:59.585
<i>Who should not make it</i>
<i>to the final six?</i>

35:59.653 --> 36:01.921
I vote for Vinny.

36:01.989 --> 36:06.626
He didn't pull his weight
tonight,

36:06.694 --> 36:10.363
wow. Uh, Vinny.

36:10.431 --> 36:12.732
I don't think she would
have lasted this long

36:12.800 --> 36:14.367
<i>if the rest of the girls' team</i>
<i>wasn't as good as they are.</i>

36:14.435 --> 36:16.035
Uh, Trev.

36:16.103 --> 36:18.338
Sabrina.
I don't think a 22-year-old

36:18.405 --> 36:20.006
is gonna be able to run

36:20.074 --> 36:22.608
<i>a high-end restaurant</i>
<i>like la market.</i>

36:22.676 --> 36:25.712
That's two votes for Sabrina
and one vote for Vinny.

36:25.779 --> 36:28.648
<i>Jillian,</i>
<i>who's the weakest Chef?</i>

36:28.716 --> 36:31.751
Trev is the weakest Chef
here.

36:31.819 --> 36:33.152
His attitude sucks.

36:35.389 --> 36:36.923
Wow.

36:36.990 --> 36:38.658
<i>Okay, Gail.</i>

36:38.726 --> 36:40.426
Trevor, Chef.

36:40.494 --> 36:42.895
Two votes for Trevor.
Oh, it ain't over yet.

36:42.963 --> 36:43.963
Nona.
Trev.

36:44.031 --> 36:47.033
Trevor.
Yes.

36:47.101 --> 36:50.203
Sabrina.
Trev.

36:50.270 --> 36:53.005
Wow.
Four women...

36:53.073 --> 36:55.508
And four votes for Trev.

36:55.576 --> 36:58.845
Never been a ladies' man.

36:58.912 --> 37:00.980
Okay, Trev,
step forward.

37:07.254 --> 37:10.723
You have come
a lot further

37:10.791 --> 37:13.426
than I thought you would.

37:13.494 --> 37:17.930
I don't know how to say this.

37:20.501 --> 37:21.934
Let's go, big boy.

37:25.339 --> 37:26.572
And put this one on.
!

37:26.640 --> 37:27.673
Congratulations.
Thanks.

37:27.741 --> 37:30.710
You're in the final six.

37:30.778 --> 37:32.412
Well done.
Thank you, Chef.

37:32.479 --> 37:35.148
You may not be liked,
but you got the jacket.

37:35.215 --> 37:38.518
Damn straight.

37:38.585 --> 37:40.787
Okay.

37:40.854 --> 37:41.854
The final six.

37:44.224 --> 37:45.291
My decision is...

37:47.428 --> 37:49.429
Jillian, step forward.

37:51.632 --> 37:52.765
Take your jacket off.

37:52.833 --> 37:54.133
<i>Congratulations.</i>

37:54.201 --> 37:55.902
You deserve
one of these babies.

37:55.969 --> 37:57.403
Thank you, Chef.
Don't stop.

37:57.471 --> 37:58.337
I won't, Chef.

37:59.506 --> 38:01.307
Uh...

38:03.710 --> 38:05.278
Nona.

38:05.345 --> 38:08.214
The lady with the palate.

38:08.282 --> 38:09.882
Well done. Congratulations.
Thank you, Chef.

38:09.950 --> 38:10.783
Yes.

38:15.956 --> 38:18.891
Russell.
Get your ass down here.

38:21.228 --> 38:22.895
Thanks.
I appreciate it.

38:25.232 --> 38:26.165
Okay.
Two jackets left.

38:26.233 --> 38:28.000
<i>Three Chefs standing.</i>

38:32.072 --> 38:34.307
Sabrina.

Congratulations.

<i>You're into</i>

38:40.514 --> 38:42.415
Why are you crying?
I'm so happy.

38:42.483 --> 38:44.417
Well, you should be
happy.

38:47.588 --> 38:50.022
<i>Gail and Vinny...</i>

38:50.090 --> 38:52.225
I've got one jacket.

38:52.292 --> 38:54.160

39:02.217 --> 39:05.513
Tonight, the final six Chefs
will receive black jackets.

39:05.613 --> 39:08.481
Chef Ramsay has already chosen
the first five.

39:08.549 --> 39:11.017
Congratulations.
You're into the final six.

39:11.085 --> 39:15.188
And now only one jacket remains.

<i>clearly, the weakest Chefs</i>
<i>on tonight's service.</i>

39:30.610 --> 39:34.146

I want it, Chef.

Vinny,

<i>why do you think</i>

39:41.020 --> 39:42.821

39:42.889 --> 39:45.557
Being a Chef is all
I've ever really wanted,

39:45.625 --> 39:47.826
and I would be gravely
disappointed

39:47.894 --> 39:50.176
<i>if that jacket was not put</i>
<i>around my back right now</i>

39:50.379 --> 39:51.276
my problem with you is that

39:51.376 --> 39:53.944
<i>you are on the decline.</i>

39:54.012 --> 39:56.046
Gail, why do you think you
should stay in Hell's Kitchen?

39:56.114 --> 39:57.848
I can fight, Chef.
My team trusts me.

39:57.916 --> 39:59.283
They find me an asset
to the team.

39:59.351 --> 40:02.152
<i>I'm just gonna keep fighting.</i>

40:04.356 --> 40:05.889
Okay, my decision is...

Gail, take off your jacket.

40:22.836 --> 40:24.137
The black jacket's
yours.

40:24.204 --> 40:25.571
Congratulations.

40:25.639 --> 40:27.373
Back in line.

40:27.441 --> 40:28.908
<i>Vinny,</i>
<i>take off your jacket.</i>

40:31.245 --> 40:33.579
Tonight we were backed up
like I've never seen before,

40:33.647 --> 40:36.649
and I didn't expect it
this far down the line.

40:36.717 --> 40:38.117
Thank you.
Thank you.

40:38.185 --> 40:40.052
<i>Good luck.</i>

40:40.120 --> 40:41.387
Bye, Vinny.

40:43.590 --> 40:45.191
I lost.

40:45.259 --> 40:47.059
I had my shot
right in front of my face,

40:47.127 --> 40:48.494
and I blew it.

40:48.562 --> 40:49.996
I came here
with the intention of winning,

40:50.063 --> 40:51.330
and I failed.

40:51.398 --> 40:53.399
This is the worst night
of my life.

40:53.467 --> 40:55.268
Chef Ramsay, I really wanted
that black jacket so badly,

40:55.335 --> 40:56.269
you have no idea.

40:57.838 --> 40:59.138
Well done.

40:59.206 --> 41:00.573
Thank you, Chef.

41:00.641 --> 41:02.508
All of you,
get out of there,

41:02.576 --> 41:04.644
and get some sleep, yes?
Yes, Chef.

41:04.711 --> 41:06.179
<i>Well done.</i>
<i>Thank you, Chef.</i>

41:06.246 --> 41:07.013
Well done, well done,
well done.

41:07.080 --> 41:08.414
Ow!
Yes!

41:08.482 --> 41:10.249
And Vinny's gone!

41:10.317 --> 41:11.684
Aah!

41:11.752 --> 41:14.487
Vinny, I took
your black coat, bitch.

41:15.989 --> 41:19.058
I dodged
the biggest bullet.

41:19.126 --> 41:20.326
I cannot wait to show
Chef Ramsay

41:20.394 --> 41:21.661
everything that I have.

41:21.728 --> 41:24.297
I will die here
if I have to.

41:24.364 --> 41:26.399
The girls
hung me out to dry.

41:26.466 --> 41:27.867
The bitches.

41:27.935 --> 41:30.436
I'm gonna out-perform
all your asses.

41:30.504 --> 41:32.238
When the competition
first started,

41:32.306 --> 41:34.240
I thought Vinny
was the one to beat.

41:34.308 --> 41:36.475
But after tonight's
dismal performance,

41:36.543 --> 41:38.544
he's now the one
to go home.
