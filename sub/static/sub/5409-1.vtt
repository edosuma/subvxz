01:48.914 --> 01:51.416
- Come here.
- What?

02:09.933 --> 02:13.228
- Good morning, Mrs Staples.
- Good morning, madam.

02:24.363 --> 02:26.365
Late! Late!

03:22.333 --> 03:25.253
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

03:29.758 --> 03:31.050
Fuck!

03:42.061 --> 03:46.148
- Fuck! Right, we take yours.
- It only goes 40 miles an hour.

03:56.699 --> 03:58.701
What turn-off?

03:59.952 --> 04:03.039
- Better not be the B359.
- It's the B359.

04:03.331 --> 04:05.208
Fuck it!

04:09.461 --> 04:10.962
Fuck!

04:16.218 --> 04:17.135
Fuck.

04:29.146 --> 04:31.440
Fuck.

04:40.740 --> 04:41.825
Fuck.

04:41.991 --> 04:43.284
Fuckity fuck!

04:48.581 --> 04:50.458
Bugger.

05:00.008 --> 05:02.010
Hello, Charles.

05:17.734 --> 05:19.819
There's a greatness to your lateness.

05:20.027 --> 05:22.738
It's not achieved without real suffering.

05:24.531 --> 05:26.366
I am so sorry.

05:26.533 --> 05:30.120
I'll be killing myself after the service,
if that's any consolation.

05:30.370 --> 05:34.541
- Doesn't matter. Tom was standing by.
- Thanks, Tom. You're a saint.

05:34.833 --> 05:36.709
Disastrous haircut.

05:41.213 --> 05:43.799
- You haven't forgotten the rings?
- No.

06:03.026 --> 06:05.612
Hate people being late. Hate it.

06:16.330 --> 06:18.332
Here we go.

06:40.352 --> 06:42.687
Oh, isn't she lovely!

06:42.896 --> 06:46.316
Scarlett, you're blind.
She looks like a big meringue.

06:54.073 --> 06:57.910
Dear friends, what a joy it is
to welcome you to our church...

06:58.160 --> 07:02.164
...on this wonderful day
for Angus and Laura.

07:02.415 --> 07:07.627
Before we start the service,
let us all join together in the first hymn.

08:10.853 --> 08:12.646
Scarlett.

08:15.733 --> 08:19.528
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
together here in the sight of God

08:19.779 --> 08:21.905
...and in the face of this congregation...

08:22.113 --> 08:26.159
...to join together this man
and this woman in holy matrimony,...

08:26.451 --> 08:30.789
...which is an honourable estate,
instituted in the time of man's innocency.

08:31.039 --> 08:32.248
Back in a sec.

08:32.414 --> 08:34.793
If any man can show
any just cause or impediment...

08:35.001 --> 08:37.419
...why they may not be
lawfully joined together,...

08:37.503 --> 08:40.714
...let him speak now
or for ever hold his peace.

08:42.006 --> 08:44.927
Do you promise to love her, comfort her,...

08:45.010 --> 08:48.013
...honour and keep her,
in sickness and in health,...

08:48.263 --> 08:52.058
...and, forsaking all others,
keep thee only unto her...

08:52.350 --> 08:55.144
...for as long as ye both shall live?
- I do.

08:55.686 --> 08:57.480
To love and to cherish...

08:57.563 --> 09:00.441
...till death us do part.
- till death us do part.

09:00.650 --> 09:05.363
- And thereto I pledge thee my troth.
- And thereto I pledge thee my troth.

09:07.114 --> 09:09.116
Do you have the ring?

09:16.206 --> 09:20.793
- With this ring, I thee wed.
- With this ring, I thee wed.

09:21.085 --> 09:23.295
With my body, I thee worship.

09:24.463 --> 09:26.841
With my body, I thee worship.

09:27.091 --> 09:29.760
And with all my worldly goods
I do thee endow.

09:30.302 --> 09:33.889
And with all my worldly goods
I thee endow.

09:39.978 --> 09:44.274
"If I speak with the tongues of men
and of angels, but have not love,...

09:44.566 --> 09:48.069
...I am become as sounding brass,
or a clanging cymbal."

09:48.194 --> 09:49.320
Good point.

10:46.999 --> 10:50.502
- Great hat.
- Thanks. I bought it specially.

10:54.839 --> 10:56.674
There.

11:03.681 --> 11:06.392
Right. Get in position, please.

11:06.934 --> 11:09.019
Thank you. Smile.

11:09.561 --> 11:13.982
- Splendid, I thought. What did you think?
- I thought splendid. What did you think?

11:14.233 --> 11:15.442
Splendid, I thought.

11:15.609 --> 11:18.028
Scarlotta, fabulous dress!

11:18.237 --> 11:20.571
The ecclesiastical purple
and the pagan orange...

11:20.780 --> 11:22.907
...symbolising the symbiosis in marriage...

11:23.074 --> 11:25.576
...between the heathen
and Christian traditions?

11:25.785 --> 11:27.578
That's right.

11:28.079 --> 11:30.790
Lovely. And again.

11:32.375 --> 11:35.877
- Any idea who the girl in the black hat is?
- Name's Carrie.

11:36.128 --> 11:38.839
- She's pretty.
- American.

11:39.172 --> 11:40.090
Interesting.

11:40.215 --> 11:42.300
Slut.

11:42.509 --> 11:44.428
Really?

11:44.928 --> 11:47.222
Used to work at Vogue.
Lives in America now.

11:47.431 --> 11:49.933
Only goes out with
very glamorous people.

11:50.142 --> 11:52.518
Quite out of your league.

11:53.436 --> 11:55.438
Well, that's a relief. Thanks.

11:55.813 --> 11:59.817
- See you there.
- Off you go.

12:00.943 --> 12:03.320
Right. Reception.

12:07.407 --> 12:09.409
Bye!

12:15.749 --> 12:18.460
Anyone else tread in a cowpat?

12:18.585 --> 12:21.295
No, thought not. See you in a mo.

12:21.503 --> 12:24.882
Do you think I'd hate him as much
if he wasn't my brother?

12:26.717 --> 12:31.096
Don't want to blow my chances
for romance by smelling of dung.

12:35.224 --> 12:38.853
I never know what to say
in these wretched line-ups.

12:39.103 --> 12:43.024
It's a cinch. Just give a big, warm hug
and say the bride looks pregnant.

12:43.274 --> 12:47.612
- Or go for "You must be very proud".
- Heaven preserve us.

12:48.112 --> 12:50.405
- You must be very proud.
- Indeed.

12:51.323 --> 12:53.116
- Hello.
- Hello.

12:53.283 --> 12:54.493
Hello.

13:01.333 --> 13:04.503
Hi. We've met. It's Richard Maples.

13:06.003 --> 13:08.005
Bastard.

13:14.762 --> 13:16.180
Hello, Bern.

13:16.347 --> 13:17.640
Two, please.

13:17.807 --> 13:20.892
- You have fun.
- Take care.

13:23.978 --> 13:26.272
- Hello.
- Hi.

13:27.607 --> 13:30.902
- Do you want one of these?
- Thank you.

13:31.152 --> 13:32.862
- I...
- Hello, Charles.

13:33.029 --> 13:35.948
Hello, dear John.
How are you? How are you?

13:36.156 --> 13:38.909
- Good. This is...
- Carrie.

13:39.159 --> 13:41.870
- Delighted. I'm John.
- Hi, John.

13:43.664 --> 13:46.750
- How's your gorgeous girlfriend?
- She's no longer my girlfriend.

13:47.084 --> 13:49.420
Ah, dear. I wouldn't get
too gloomy about it.

13:49.586 --> 13:53.923
Rumour has it she never stopped bonking
Toby de Lisle in case you didn't work out.

13:54.173 --> 13:57.260
She is now my wife.

13:57.510 --> 14:00.013
Excellent. Congratulations.

14:00.263 --> 14:02.265
Excuse me.

14:03.141 --> 14:05.642
Any kids or anything, John?

14:05.892 --> 14:09.396
Do we hear the patter of tiny feet?

14:10.689 --> 14:12.149
No.

14:12.190 --> 14:16.194
Well, there's plenty of time for that,
isn't there? No hurry.

14:25.870 --> 14:27.872
Hi. How are you?

14:43.386 --> 14:46.306
- My name's Fiona.
- I'm Gerald.

14:47.682 --> 14:51.185
- What do you do?
- I'm training to be a priest.

14:51.393 --> 14:53.312
Good Lord!

14:53.896 --> 14:56.523
- Do you do weddings?
- No, not yet.

14:56.648 --> 14:59.234
I will, of course. Jolly nerve-racking.

14:59.443 --> 15:02.654
Yes, rather like the first time one has sex.

15:04.572 --> 15:06.449
Well, I suppose so.

15:06.657 --> 15:10.870
Though rather less messy, of course,
and far less call for condoms.

15:34.892 --> 15:39.105
- Who's that boy over there in the grey?
- His name's David.

15:39.897 --> 15:42.316
Something of a dish, isn't he?

15:42.525 --> 15:44.652
Well, I've always thought so.

15:44.819 --> 15:47.530
- Why are they...?
- The dish can't hear.

15:49.864 --> 15:50.865
Gosh.

15:50.990 --> 15:55.286
Yeah, silent but deadly attractive.

15:56.204 --> 15:58.081
Bang, bang, bang. That's it.

15:58.248 --> 16:00.959
Into the marquee, please.
Dinner is served.

16:03.670 --> 16:07.589
- How do you do?
- Hello. Tom. Splendid to meet you.

16:07.840 --> 16:09.842
Very exciting.

16:21.936 --> 16:23.354
Hi.

16:24.647 --> 16:29.360
My name's Scarlett. Don't let me
drink too much cos I'll get really flirty.

16:31.237 --> 16:35.699
- How do you do? My name's Charles.
- Don't be ridiculous.

16:35.907 --> 16:41.413
- Charles died 20 years ago.
- Must be a different Charles, I think.

16:41.747 --> 16:44.041
Are you telling me
I don't know my own brother?

16:44.249 --> 16:45.250
No.

17:01.682 --> 17:05.560
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm sorry to drag you from your desserts.

17:05.852 --> 17:09.731
There are just one or two little things
I feel I should say, as best man.

17:09.981 --> 17:14.694
This is only the second time I've been
a best man. I hope I did OK that time.

17:14.986 --> 17:18.198
The couple in question
are at least still talking to me.

17:19.906 --> 17:23.702
Unfortunately, they're not
actually talking to each other.

17:23.952 --> 17:27.289
The divorce came through
a couple of months ago.

17:29.124 --> 17:32.795
But I'm assured it had
absolutely nothing to do with me.

17:33.045 --> 17:38.549
Paula knew Piers had slept with her sister
before I mentioned it in the speech.

17:40.134 --> 17:43.429
The fact that he'd slept with her mother
came as a surprise,...

17:43.638 --> 17:51.186
...but I think was incidental to the
nightmare of recrimination and violence...

17:51.603 --> 17:54.398
...that became their two-day marriage.

17:54.648 --> 17:57.859
Anyway, enough of that.
My job today is to talk about Angus.

17:58.068 --> 18:00.779
There are no skeletons in his cupboard.

18:01.029 --> 18:03.532
Or so I thought.

18:04.532 --> 18:08.452
I'll come on to that in a minute.
I would just like to say this.

18:12.039 --> 18:13.541
I am,...

18:13.749 --> 18:20.296
...as ever, in bewildered awe of anyone
who makes this kind of commitment...

18:20.714 --> 18:23.717
...that Angus and Laura have made today.

18:24.342 --> 18:27.345
I know I couldn't do it and...

18:27.595 --> 18:30.473
...I think it's wonderful they can.

18:30.724 --> 18:33.809
So, back to Angus and those sheep.

18:38.022 --> 18:40.941
So, ladies and gentlemen,
if you'd raise your glasses.

18:41.150 --> 18:43.569
The adorable couple.

19:49.963 --> 19:52.466
I remember the first time
I saw Gareth dancing.

19:52.591 --> 19:54.968
I feared lives would be lost.

19:57.471 --> 20:00.474
She's a pretty girl,
the one you can't take your eyes off.

20:00.683 --> 20:03.394
Is it love at first sight?

20:03.601 --> 20:06.688
Good Lord, no!
It's the bloke she's dancing with.

20:06.938 --> 20:11.651
I played rugby with him at school.
I'm wondering what position he played.

20:13.027 --> 20:15.822
Though, let's say,
for the sake of argument,...

20:16.030 --> 20:19.199
...one did take a fancy
to someone at a wedding.

20:19.449 --> 20:22.369
Do you think there really
are people who can say...

20:22.577 --> 20:26.289
..."Hi, babe. My name's Charles.
This is your lucky night"?

20:27.499 --> 20:30.585
- Well, if there are, they're not English.
- Quite.

20:32.379 --> 20:35.673
Three weeks is about
my question-popping minimum.

20:36.757 --> 20:40.386
You know I love you, Jean, don't you?
I love you. I love you.

20:41.137 --> 20:46.434
And, Mike, I've never met you before,
but I love you very much. I really do.

20:48.435 --> 20:51.146
Ignore her. She's drunk.

20:51.354 --> 20:54.941
At least I hope she is.
Otherwise, I'm in real trouble.

20:57.819 --> 21:00.447
- How's it going, Lyds?
- Bloody awful.

21:00.655 --> 21:03.574
Oh, dear! What's the prob?

21:03.657 --> 21:06.869
I was promised sex. Everybody said it.

21:07.161 --> 21:10.998
"You be a bridesmaid, you'll get sex.
You'll be fighting them off."

21:11.165 --> 21:14.793
But not so much as a tongue in sight.

21:15.544 --> 21:19.964
Well, I mean, if you fancy anything,...

21:20.840 --> 21:24.344
- I could always...
- Don't be ridiculous, Bernard.

21:24.510 --> 21:27.847
- I'm not that desperate.
- No, right. Of course.

21:28.056 --> 21:31.267
Fair enough. It's a good point.

21:48.199 --> 21:49.408
Bye!

21:50.993 --> 21:54.413
Have a lovely time! Bye!

22:25.818 --> 22:28.153
Where are you staying tonight, Charles?

22:29.780 --> 22:35.201
Scarlett and I are at some pub. The Lucky
Boat, something like that. Aren't we all?

22:35.535 --> 22:38.413
No. Slight change of plan.

22:38.663 --> 22:41.874
The others are coming back to my place.
Nansy's in residence.

22:42.083 --> 22:45.503
Might knock us up a plate of eggs
and bake over a late-night Scrabble.

22:45.753 --> 22:49.965
- I wondered if you'd like to join.
- Yeah! Thanks very much.

22:50.215 --> 22:52.759
- Is there room for Scarlett?
- Absolutely.

22:52.968 --> 22:54.928
137 rooms, actually.

22:56.471 --> 23:00.100
Right. Tommy, are you
the richest man in England?

23:00.350 --> 23:03.269
No!

23:03.477 --> 23:06.188
I believe we're about seventh.

23:07.106 --> 23:13.321
The Queen, obviously, and that
Branson bloke's doing terribly well.

23:13.612 --> 23:17.616
Well, excellent news.
I'll go and tell Scarlett.

23:17.866 --> 23:18.950
Yeah.

23:19.117 --> 23:22.454
That's unless you get lucky first.

23:29.753 --> 23:31.963
Hi.

23:32.172 --> 23:34.965
Hi. I thought you'd gone.

23:35.049 --> 23:40.471
No, not yet. I was just wondering
where you were staying tonight.

23:40.804 --> 23:42.389
Well...

23:42.556 --> 23:45.851
I was staying at some pub
called The Lucky...

23:46.143 --> 23:49.354
- The Boat or something like that.
- Boatman.

23:49.562 --> 23:52.690
Right. But now I'm going to stay
at some friends' house...

23:52.899 --> 23:55.318
...with some friends.

23:55.526 --> 23:59.238
Well, I think "enormous castle"
is a more accurate description.

23:59.489 --> 24:01.783
That's too bad,
because I'm at The Boatman.

24:04.242 --> 24:08.455
Well, it was nice not quite meeting you.

24:10.207 --> 24:12.584
- It was a great speech.
- Thanks.

24:18.631 --> 24:23.844
- Well, I'm going now.
- No! No, no. Don't go. We can meet now.

24:24.095 --> 24:28.307
- The evening's just getting going.
- We both know that's a big lie.

24:33.144 --> 24:34.562
Fuck.

25:00.170 --> 25:02.672
The castle beckons, Tom. Are you sober?

25:02.880 --> 25:05.550
Absolutely. Orange juice all night.

25:08.094 --> 25:09.220
Come on.

25:13.474 --> 25:14.767
Bye, everybody!

25:14.934 --> 25:17.145
All together now.

25:25.068 --> 25:27.070
Bernard!

25:48.089 --> 25:50.383
Tom, can you stop the car?

25:50.592 --> 25:52.594
Stop the car.

25:54.054 --> 25:58.266
Sorry. I just think
I might stay in that pub after all.

25:58.516 --> 26:00.644
Why on earth...?

26:09.693 --> 26:15.032
No, seriously. I'm doing some research
into pubs with the word "boat" in the title.

26:15.366 --> 26:18.576
- Oh, well. Please yourself.
- It's a silly thing.

26:24.582 --> 26:26.584
Right.

26:29.504 --> 26:31.506
Odd decision.

27:13.920 --> 27:15.839
Hello.

27:16.047 --> 27:18.048
- Hi.
- Hi.

27:18.924 --> 27:21.135
In the end there wasn't room for all of us.

27:21.552 --> 27:23.345
You said it was a castle.

27:23.554 --> 27:27.933
Yes, it is a castle.
It's just a very, very small one.

27:28.225 --> 27:30.853
Tiny, in fact.
Just one up, one down, which is rare.

27:31.061 --> 27:32.812
Drink, sir?

27:32.979 --> 27:36.107
Yeah. I'd like a glass of whisky, please.

27:36.316 --> 27:38.526
- Do you want...?
- Yeah, sounds good.

27:38.943 --> 27:41.279
- Another for the lady.
- Doubles, sir?

27:41.446 --> 27:43.448
Thanks.

27:44.615 --> 27:46.784
You here, too? How are you?

27:48.035 --> 27:51.622
- Hello. I'm fine.
- Haven't seen Carrie, have you?

27:51.788 --> 27:54.791
- Who?
- Carrie. American girl. Lovely legs.

27:55.626 --> 27:58.045
Wedding guest. Nice smell.

27:58.253 --> 28:00.839
- No. Sorry.
- Damn!

28:01.089 --> 28:03.799
Blast! I think I was in there.

28:05.885 --> 28:09.055
If you do see her,
could you tell her I've gone to my room?

28:09.305 --> 28:10.598
Yeah.

28:10.723 --> 28:12.725
- Your whisky, sir.
- Thank you.

28:12.933 --> 28:15.227
- And one for the...
- Road. Lovely.

28:15.519 --> 28:18.938
I think I might have one of those.
Do you mind if I join you?

28:19.105 --> 28:23.026
- No. It'd be lovely.
- Another glass of whisky and a cigar.

28:23.276 --> 28:26.905
Hold on. Make that a bottle.
We might as well settle in, eh?

28:27.113 --> 28:29.407
Let's see if we can push on till dawn.

28:29.616 --> 28:32.534
- Lovely wedding.
- Yes.

28:32.743 --> 28:35.746
I was at school with his brother Bufty.
Tremendous bloke.

28:35.996 --> 28:38.707
He was head of my house.
Buggered me senseless.

28:38.916 --> 28:41.085
Still, it taught me about life.

28:42.252 --> 28:44.755
Where do you know him from?

28:44.922 --> 28:47.840
- University.
- Splendid.

28:48.091 --> 28:49.968
Splendid. Yep.

28:50.885 --> 28:53.471
I didn't go myself. I couldn't see the point.

28:53.721 --> 28:57.225
When you work in the money markets, what
use of the nobles of wordsworth gonna be?

28:57.684 --> 29:01.187
Excuse me, sir. Your wife says
could you come upstairs at once?

29:01.437 --> 29:03.814
Room 12, in case you're so drunk
you can't remember.

29:04.022 --> 29:06.233
- My wife?
- Yes, sir.

29:06.775 --> 29:09.278
My wife!

29:09.486 --> 29:12.656
God! You are drunk if you can't
remember you've got a wife.

29:12.906 --> 29:14.700
Yeah...

29:15.409 --> 29:19.370
- Do you mind if I...
- No, no. Off you go. Best of luck.

29:19.662 --> 29:23.374
Lucky bachelor, me. I'll have another
search for that Katie creature.

29:23.624 --> 29:26.711
- Carrie.
- That's the one. Damn fine filly.

29:27.712 --> 29:29.714
I think I'm in there.

29:46.062 --> 29:47.896
- Hi.
- Hello.

29:48.063 --> 29:51.108
- Sorry about that.
- He was hard to get rid of.

29:51.358 --> 29:53.360
Yeah.

29:53.569 --> 29:54.570
So...

30:01.701 --> 30:07.915
Maybe we could just skulk around here
for a bit and then go back down.

30:09.626 --> 30:12.003
That's a thought. I don't usually skulk,...

30:12.253 --> 30:15.965
...but I suppose I could skulk
if skulking were required.

30:16.215 --> 30:18.634
Do you skulk regularly?

30:19.551 --> 30:25.724
No. No, I don't normally think of myself
as a skulker but...

30:29.102 --> 30:35.524
Well, why don't you come in
and skulk for a while and we'll see?

30:43.699 --> 30:48.745
I noticed the bride and groom didn't kiss
in the church, which is kind of strange.

30:49.037 --> 30:51.873
Where I come from, kissing is very big.

30:52.582 --> 30:56.795
Is it? Well, I think you're right.
We are probably more reserved.

30:57.087 --> 31:00.131
"You may kiss the bride" isn't
actually in the Book of Common Prayer.

31:00.382 --> 31:04.093
I always worry I'll go too far
in the heat of the moment.

31:07.680 --> 31:10.099
How far do you think too far would be?

31:10.307 --> 31:12.601
I don't know.

31:14.061 --> 31:15.771
Maybe...

31:17.730 --> 31:20.149
...that would be all right.

31:20.316 --> 31:24.821
- I think that would be fine.
- In fact, it might be a bit dismissive.

31:26.489 --> 31:28.491
Maybe this...

31:29.701 --> 31:31.910
...might be better.

31:34.121 --> 31:38.083
Yeah, I think it would be dangerous
to take it any further.

31:39.084 --> 31:41.086
I mean...

31:53.264 --> 31:55.891
That might be taking it a little far.

32:02.147 --> 32:03.565
What about this?

32:03.732 --> 32:08.528
Do you think the vicar would think things
had slipped a little out of his control?

32:08.820 --> 32:14.409
I think he might. This kind of thing
is really better suited to the honeymoon...

32:14.743 --> 32:17.119
...than to the service itself.

32:17.328 --> 32:20.122
Why do you think
it's called a honeymoon?

32:21.206 --> 32:26.503
I don't know. I suppose it's "honey"
cos it's sweet as honey...

32:26.837 --> 32:30.841
...and "moon" because it was the first time...

32:32.133 --> 32:35.762
...a husband got to see his wife's bottom.

33:16.091 --> 33:18.093
What's happening?

33:19.678 --> 33:21.680
I have to go.

33:23.139 --> 33:25.934
- Where?
- America.

33:27.811 --> 33:29.813
That is a tragedy.

33:31.063 --> 33:33.274
Just before I go,...

33:33.357 --> 33:37.569
...when were you thinking of
announcing the engagement?

33:40.239 --> 33:42.658
Sorry. Whose engagement?

33:43.826 --> 33:45.327
Ours.

33:45.494 --> 33:49.872
I assumed since we slept together
and everything, we'd be getting married.

33:50.581 --> 33:52.583
What did you think?

33:55.670 --> 33:57.672
I...

33:59.424 --> 34:06.346
Gosh! You know, that takes a lot
of thinking about, that kind of thing.

34:06.722 --> 34:09.141
Obviously, I'm... I...

34:11.643 --> 34:13.645
You're joking.

34:16.856 --> 34:20.234
God! For a moment there
I thought I was in Fatal Attraction.

34:20.525 --> 34:25.114
You were Glenn Close and I was
gonna find my pet rabbit on the stove.

34:26.449 --> 34:28.451
No.

34:29.869 --> 34:33.871
But I think we both missed
a great opportunity here.

34:39.043 --> 34:41.045
Bye.

35:06.486 --> 35:08.863
Oh, fuck!

35:12.325 --> 35:13.326
Fuck!

35:14.911 --> 35:16.912
Fuckity fuck!

35:17.329 --> 35:18.705
Fuck!

35:18.997 --> 35:22.084
- Car or taxi?
- Taxi. We could never park.

35:30.675 --> 35:33.094
Car seems a good idea.

35:34.262 --> 35:36.264
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

35:46.815 --> 35:48.942
Leave it. No one will notice.

36:13.716 --> 36:15.925
Sorry, I'm late. Traffic.

36:18.511 --> 36:21.431
Yeah... Who is it today?

36:52.960 --> 36:54.921
One more, please.

37:49.346 --> 37:53.934
In the name of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

37:54.268 --> 37:56.144
Amen.

37:57.104 --> 37:58.939
Let us pray.

37:59.106 --> 38:03.609
Father, you have made
the bond of marriage a holy mystery,...

38:04.443 --> 38:08.072
...a symbol of Christ's love for his church.

38:08.322 --> 38:16.830
Hear our prayers for Bernard and Lydia
through your Son, Jesus Christ our Lord,...

38:17.289 --> 38:21.001
...who lives and reigns
with you and the Holy Goat...

38:22.168 --> 38:23.670
Ghost.

38:24.379 --> 38:27.007
One God, for ever and ever.

38:27.632 --> 38:28.925
Amen.

38:29.092 --> 38:31.594
It's his first time. He's a family friend.

38:33.012 --> 38:34.847
Bernard and Lydia,...

38:35.014 --> 38:39.685
...I shall now ask if you freely undertake
the obligations of marriage.

38:40.019 --> 38:42.896
Bernard, repeat after me.

38:43.063 --> 38:47.358
- I do solemnly declare...
- I do solemnly declare...

38:47.609 --> 38:50.236
...that I know not
of any lawful impediment...

38:50.570 --> 38:53.573
...that I know not
of any lawful impediment...

38:53.781 --> 38:55.575
...why I, Lydia...

38:56.576 --> 38:58.578
...why I, Bernard...

39:00.913 --> 39:01.788
Sorry.

39:02.748 --> 39:09.254
...why I, Bernard Godfrey
Saint John Delaney,...

39:09.504 --> 39:14.217
...why I, Bernard Geoffrey
St John Delaney,...

39:16.177 --> 39:21.474
...may not be joined in matrimony
to Lydia John Hibbott.

39:22.558 --> 39:27.146
...may not be joined in matrimony
to Lydia Jane Hibbott.

39:29.231 --> 39:32.234
Lydia, repeat after me.

39:33.318 --> 39:36.529
- I do solemnly declare...
- I do solemnly declare...

39:36.738 --> 39:39.032
...that I know not
of any lawful impediment...

39:39.491 --> 39:42.661
...that I know not
of any lawful impediment...

39:42.869 --> 39:46.580
...why I, Lydia Jane Hibbott,...

39:47.039 --> 39:49.959
...why I, Lydia Jane Hibbott,...

39:50.209 --> 39:52.503
...may not be johned in matrimony...

39:52.711 --> 39:56.382
...may not be joined in matrimony...

39:56.674 --> 40:02.262
...to Bernard Geoffrey
Sidd... Siddun... Delaney.

40:03.012 --> 40:08.017
...to Bernard Geoffrey St John Delaney.

40:11.479 --> 40:14.898
I call upon those persons
here present to witness...

40:15.857 --> 40:19.236
I call upon those persons
here present to witness...

40:19.486 --> 40:21.780
...that I, Bernard...

40:28.662 --> 40:30.162
...Delaney,...

40:32.748 --> 40:34.750
...that I, Bernard Delaney,...

40:34.917 --> 40:37.503
...do take thee, Lydia Jane Hibbott,...

40:37.962 --> 40:40.965
...do take thee, Lydia Jane Hibbott,...

40:41.173 --> 40:44.175
...to be my awful wedded wife.

40:44.426 --> 40:47.345
...to be my lawful wedded wife.

40:47.554 --> 40:49.556
That's ri... That's right.

40:49.723 --> 40:52.183
May Almighty God bless you all.

40:52.350 --> 40:56.021
The Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spigot... Spirit.

40:56.271 --> 40:57.272
Amen.

40:57.439 --> 40:59.440
Bravo!

41:20.793 --> 41:22.003
Thanks.

41:22.170 --> 41:24.172
Coming, Bernie!

41:24.964 --> 41:25.924
Sorry.

41:26.758 --> 41:28.551
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

41:28.801 --> 41:30.510
That way?

41:30.677 --> 41:33.180
Sorry. Could you two...? Sorry.

41:34.014 --> 41:35.641
Sorry!

41:51.864 --> 41:54.158
I've got a new theory about marriage.

41:54.909 --> 42:00.580
Two people are in love, they live together,
and one day they run out of conversation.

42:00.914 --> 42:04.834
Totally. They can't think of a single thing
to say to each other.

42:05.085 --> 42:07.087
That's it. Panic.

42:07.295 --> 42:13.218
Then suddenly, it occurs to the chap
that there is a way out of the deadlock.

42:15.010 --> 42:17.888
- Which is?
- He'll ask her to marry him.

42:18.138 --> 42:20.057
Brilliant!

42:20.224 --> 42:24.645
They've got something to talk about
for the rest of their lives.

42:24.937 --> 42:28.566
So it's just a way out of
an embarrassing pause in conversation.

42:28.691 --> 42:31.276
The definitive icebreaker.

42:31.401 --> 42:35.572
- Tom! How's the speech coming along?
- It's pretty good, I think.

42:35.863 --> 42:39.075
Something for everyone. Tears, laughter...

42:40.868 --> 42:44.162
- Excellent.
- It's a very good theory, Gareth.

42:44.413 --> 42:49.209
There is another argument, of course,
that it has something to do with true love.

42:49.543 --> 42:51.545
Well, there's a thought.

42:55.799 --> 42:59.802
- Can I help you, sir?
- Can I have three brandies, please?

43:00.052 --> 43:01.470
Hi.

43:03.097 --> 43:04.181
Hello!

43:04.348 --> 43:06.851
- How are you?
- Fine!

43:08.352 --> 43:11.105
Sorry. I'm overwhelmed to see you.

43:13.190 --> 43:15.775
Look, don't go back to America. Please.

43:16.026 --> 43:18.820
- I'll be back in two secs, OK?
- OK.

43:20.822 --> 43:22.240
Hi, Fi.

43:23.116 --> 43:25.035
Those are yours. See you in five hours.

43:25.201 --> 43:29.204
- Something happened?
- It has. This is a bloody great wedding.

43:34.793 --> 43:36.086
Hi.

43:36.253 --> 43:40.090
Well, you look perfect.
In fact, you probably are perfect.

43:40.341 --> 43:43.052
- How are you?
- I'm really well.

43:43.260 --> 43:46.596
Charles, I'd like you
to meet Hamish, my fiancé.

43:49.766 --> 43:52.769
Excellent.

43:52.936 --> 43:55.730
How do you do, Hamish?
Delighted to meet you.

43:55.980 --> 43:58.149
Charming surprise
to find Carrie back in the country.

43:58.358 --> 44:00.359
Took a lot of persuading, I can tell you.

44:00.525 --> 44:02.945
Darling, I told James
I was going to get you.

44:03.153 --> 44:06.156
He'll think I've totally
lost control of you already.

44:06.365 --> 44:08.575
I'll see you later.

44:17.541 --> 44:19.919
How are you doing, Charles?

44:20.878 --> 44:23.381
Not great, actually, suddenly.

44:26.509 --> 44:28.510
I don't know...

44:29.553 --> 44:33.640
I mean, what the hell’s going on here?

44:33.890 --> 44:38.395
Why am I always at weddings
and never actually getting married, Matt?

44:38.728 --> 44:41.606
It's probably because you're a bit scruffy.

44:43.607 --> 44:46.819
Or it could also be because
you haven't met the right girl.

44:46.944 --> 44:49.280
Obviously, is that it?

44:49.446 --> 44:54.827
Maybe I have met the right girls.
Maybe I meet the right girls all the time.

44:55.077 --> 44:57.288
- Maybe it's me.
- Nonsense.

44:57.454 --> 45:02.375
My lords, ladies, and gentlemen,
dinner is served.

45:03.710 --> 45:06.629
Come on. Odds on,
you meet your wife at dinner.

45:08.131 --> 45:09.924
Yes.

45:20.350 --> 45:22.227
Oh, my God!

45:25.355 --> 45:27.357
Charles?

45:34.363 --> 45:36.574
- Hi.
- Hello. I'm Alistair.

45:36.782 --> 45:37.783
Great.

45:37.909 --> 45:41.120
- I believe you know Veronica.
- Yeah. Hi, Vee. Hi.

45:41.370 --> 45:43.371
Nicki.

45:45.332 --> 45:47.334
Great.

45:52.422 --> 45:54.925
Tell me, are you married?

45:55.592 --> 45:56.760
No.

45:56.927 --> 45:59.803
- Are you a lesbian?
- Good Lord!

46:01.430 --> 46:03.307
What made you say that?

46:03.474 --> 46:06.268
It's one of the possibilities
for unmarried girls.

46:06.393 --> 46:11.106
It is a bit more interesting than saying
"oh dear, just never found the right chap".

46:11.607 --> 46:15.401
- Quite right. Why be dull?
- Thank you.

46:19.739 --> 46:24.160
The truth is, I have met the right person,
only he's not in love with me.

46:24.452 --> 46:27.830
And until I stop loving him
no one else stands a chance.

46:28.080 --> 46:30.499
- Bad luck.
- Yes, isn't it?

46:32.793 --> 46:36.004
I was a lesbian once at school,
but only for 15 minutes.

46:36.213 --> 46:38.423
I don't think it counts.

46:45.596 --> 46:48.015
There are 400 different kinds of tea,...

46:48.307 --> 46:51.727
...and that's not including
all these so-called fruit teas.

46:51.936 --> 46:55.731
I took Veronica out to India at Christmas
to look at the plantations.

46:56.023 --> 46:58.817
- You and her went there once.
- That's right.

46:59.067 --> 47:03.280
Charles was vile. He insisted on
cracking jokes all the time I was ill.

47:03.947 --> 47:06.783
- Trying to cheer you up.
- You're that Veronica!

47:06.908 --> 47:09.619
Which Veronica? Charlie?

47:09.786 --> 47:12.622
- Remember Bombay?
- When Charles and I were going out,...

47:12.830 --> 47:16.500
...he told me he'd had this
interesting journey round India...

47:16.792 --> 47:20.087
...with Vomiting Veronica.
I think that was it.

47:20.296 --> 47:23.424
I don't remember ever mentioning it.
Maybe I did.

47:23.757 --> 47:27.760
Come on, Charles. I don't think I've
ever been out with anyone less discreet.

47:28.011 --> 47:31.931
- That's a bit of an exaggeration, isn't it?
- It is not.

47:32.181 --> 47:35.101
I remember you going on
about this girl Helena...

47:35.351 --> 47:38.521
...whose mother made a pass at you.
- I remember this.

47:38.813 --> 47:42.900
You couldn't work out whether it would
be impolite not to accept her advances.

47:43.191 --> 47:46.195
That's right. Mrs Piggy.
Helena was Miss Piggy,...

47:46.403 --> 47:48.864
...so her mother was Mrs Piggy!

47:49.364 --> 47:51.575
I think perhaps it was a...

47:51.783 --> 47:54.494
We've both lost a lot of weight since then.

48:01.292 --> 48:03.794
Great! The speeches.

48:04.003 --> 48:09.091
My lords, ladies, and gentlemen,
pray silence for the best man.

48:21.770 --> 48:25.440
When Bernard told me
he was getting engaged to Lydia,...

48:25.690 --> 48:30.611
...I congratulated him because all his other
girlfriends were such complete dogs.

48:33.405 --> 48:37.201
Although may I say how delighted we are
to have so many of them here today.

48:40.329 --> 48:45.124
I'm particularly delighted to see Camilla,
who many of you will remember...

48:45.416 --> 48:50.129
...as the first person
Bernard asked to marry him.

48:50.421 --> 48:53.841
If I remember rightly,
she told him to sod off.

48:57.803 --> 48:59.721
And lucky for Lydia that she did.

49:05.519 --> 49:07.396
It's very disappointing.

49:11.984 --> 49:15.278
We had the most adorable girl
at our table called Carrie.

49:15.570 --> 49:19.574
Apparently her fiancé's awfully grand
and he owns half of Scotland.

49:19.824 --> 49:23.035
- How are you?
- I'm stuck in the wedding from hell.

49:23.244 --> 49:25.872
Ghosts of girlfriends past at every turn.

49:26.080 --> 49:28.582
If I meet Henrietta,
the horror will be complete.

49:28.790 --> 49:30.208
Hello, Charles.

49:31.126 --> 49:33.086
Hello, Hen. How are you?

49:34.629 --> 49:35.630
Hen...

49:35.755 --> 49:39.342
Why can't you leave her alone?
Haven't you hurt her enough?

49:43.262 --> 49:46.849
Excuse me. I think I'd better be
where other people are not.

49:54.732 --> 49:55.649
Hello.

51:04.296 --> 51:05.881
Taxi!

51:13.888 --> 51:15.390
Good night, sir.

51:55.469 --> 51:58.889
It's all right. Oh, God! This is wonderful.

52:17.907 --> 52:21.827
Wait a minute. This is no fun.
I want to see my lovely husband...

52:45.641 --> 52:50.646
...who's a very bad bridegroom indeed.

53:06.077 --> 53:08.496
- Have you got a boyfriend?
- Yes.

53:08.663 --> 53:12.165
- What's his name?
- Dolph. He's good at table tennis.

53:12.457 --> 53:15.168
- What about you?
- No. Afraid not.

53:16.294 --> 53:18.296
Why not?

53:18.505 --> 53:20.674
Don't know.

53:21.424 --> 53:26.429
Because most of the blokes I fancy
think I'm stupid and pointless,...

53:26.720 --> 53:29.431
...so they just bonk me and then leave me,...

53:29.682 --> 53:33.477
...and the kind of blokes that do fancy me,
I think are drips.

53:33.727 --> 53:36.230
I can't even be bothered to bonk them,...

53:36.397 --> 53:39.400
...which does sort of leave me
a bit nowhere.

53:40.150 --> 53:42.569
What's bonking?

53:44.112 --> 53:50.034
Well, it's kind of like table tennis,
only with slightly smaller balls.

54:12.889 --> 54:14.974
So good!

54:27.110 --> 54:31.823
- I love my wife!
- And I love my husband!

54:35.452 --> 54:39.372
- Do you think we'd better get back?
- We could just wait a few minutes...

54:39.623 --> 54:41.540
...and have another go.

54:43.876 --> 54:45.669
Naughty little rabbit!

54:51.717 --> 54:53.594
Found it.

54:58.264 --> 55:00.683
Charles! Charles, we must talk.

55:03.186 --> 55:04.604
Right.

55:04.771 --> 55:08.775
The thing is, Charlie,
I've spoken to lots of people about you.

55:09.025 --> 55:12.736
Everybody agrees
you're in real trouble, Charles.

55:12.986 --> 55:13.987
Am I?

55:14.112 --> 55:18.325
You see, you're turning into
a kind of serial monogamist.

55:18.617 --> 55:22.913
One girlfriend after another,
yet you never really let anyone near you.

55:23.163 --> 55:25.082
On the contrary...

55:25.290 --> 55:28.292
...you're affectionate to them
and sweet to them.

55:28.501 --> 55:30.920
Even to me,
although you thought I was an idiot.

55:31.128 --> 55:33.130
- I did not.
- You did.

55:33.297 --> 55:36.384
- I thought U2 was a type of submarine.
- In a way, you were right.

55:36.676 --> 55:39.971
- Their music has a naval quality.
- Be serious, Charles.

55:40.179 --> 55:43.807
Give people a chance. You don't
have to think "I must get married",...

55:44.057 --> 55:47.853
...but you mustn't start relationships
thinking "I mustn't get married".

55:48.019 --> 55:52.107
Most of the time I don't think at all.
I just potter along.

55:52.399 --> 55:53.692
Charlie!

55:53.859 --> 55:57.236
Oh, God! The way you used to look at me!

55:57.486 --> 55:59.780
I just misread it, that's all.

55:59.989 --> 56:02.491
I thought you were going to propose...

56:02.700 --> 56:05.202
...and you were just working out
how to leave.

56:05.411 --> 56:09.248
- No. No, I wasn't.
- Oh, God, this is ridiculous.

56:10.624 --> 56:12.625
Hen...

56:13.877 --> 56:17.088
- Having a good night?
- Yes.

56:17.297 --> 56:22.218
It's right up there with my father's
funeral for sheer entertainment value.

56:22.427 --> 56:26.221
- I thought you'd gone.
- No. Hamish took the Edinburgh sleeper.

56:26.471 --> 56:28.891
I'm off now. Keep me company?

56:43.571 --> 56:45.573
Here, please.

56:46.491 --> 56:48.910
You want to come up for a nightcap?

56:51.078 --> 56:54.373
- You sure?
- Well, yes. I think we can risk it.

56:54.665 --> 56:58.376
I'm pretty sure I can resist you.
You're not that cute.

56:59.127 --> 57:01.213
Sorry... Yeah, great.

58:15.115 --> 58:18.243
Morning, Charles. Breakfast's up.

58:24.833 --> 58:27.126
What are you up to today?

58:27.334 --> 58:29.044
Oh, yeah...

58:30.045 --> 58:34.633
I'm taking advantage of the fact that,
for the first time in my entire life,...

58:34.925 --> 58:38.137
...it's Saturday
and I don't have a wedding to go to.

58:38.387 --> 58:40.680
All I have to do is not be late for David.

58:40.763 --> 58:42.765
I was going to go for a job.

58:42.974 --> 58:47.687
This new shop called Spank wants
a sales assistant. I think I'd be great.

58:47.979 --> 58:51.357
- They sell all this funny rubber stuff.
- No...

58:51.608 --> 58:56.612
Another wedding invitation,
and a list. Lovely!

58:56.945 --> 58:59.448
They say rubber's mainly for perverts.

58:59.656 --> 59:02.951
Don't know why.
I think it's very practical, actually.

59:03.076 --> 59:05.871
You spill anything on it
and it just comes off.

59:05.996 --> 59:08.707
That could be why the perverts like it.

59:08.957 --> 59:11.167
You all right?

59:12.293 --> 59:14.295
Yeah.

59:15.004 --> 59:19.217
It's that girl Carrie.
You remember, the...

59:19.467 --> 59:21.677
The American.

59:31.978 --> 59:34.397
Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt.

59:34.564 --> 59:37.692
- Do you have the wedding list for Banks?
- Certainly, sir.

59:37.901 --> 59:41.445
Lots of beautiful things
for around about the £1,000 mark.

59:43.239 --> 59:47.326
What about things around
the sort of £50 mark? Is there much?

59:48.452 --> 59:51.956
Well, you could get
that Pygmy warrior over there.

59:52.832 --> 59:54.834
This? Excellent!

59:55.042 --> 59:58.628
If you could find someone
to chip in the other 3,950.

59:58.837 --> 01:00:01.339
Or our carrier bags are £1.50 each.

01:00:01.464 --> 01:00:03.883
Why don't you just get 33 of them?

01:00:06.135 --> 01:00:08.847
Well, I think I'll probably leave it.

01:00:09.097 --> 01:00:12.099
Thanks very much. You've been very...

01:00:12.975 --> 01:00:15.978
- What did you get?
- Blimey!

01:00:16.186 --> 01:00:18.605
Well, I never!

01:00:18.814 --> 01:00:21.817
Nothing yet. I'm just, you know, deciding.

01:00:21.942 --> 01:00:25.027
- It's nice to see you.
- It's nice to see you.

01:00:26.195 --> 01:00:30.533
This present thing is great.
I should've gotten married years ago.

01:00:30.783 --> 01:00:33.661
- Anybody get the Pygmy?
- The young man thought about it...

01:00:35.079 --> 01:00:36.455
No!

01:00:36.497 --> 01:00:39.083
Just get me an ashtray.

01:00:40.458 --> 01:00:42.961
Are you free for about a half-hour?

01:00:43.211 --> 01:00:44.588
Yeah.

01:00:44.629 --> 01:00:47.841
I'm meeting my brother,
but I can be a bit late.

01:00:47.966 --> 01:00:51.261
Oh, good. You have
an important decision to make.

01:00:51.553 --> 01:00:55.055
- Now, you mustn't laugh.
- OK. Right.

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:05.399
What do you think?

01:01:07.193 --> 01:01:08.777
Divine.

01:01:08.944 --> 01:01:11.738
Bit of a meringue?

01:01:13.198 --> 01:01:15.492
Don't worry. We've only just begun.

01:01:18.536 --> 01:01:20.955
What do you think?

01:01:22.081 --> 01:01:24.501
- You're kidding.
- But it would be wonderful.

01:01:24.667 --> 01:01:27.169
Maybe next time.

01:01:28.962 --> 01:01:31.340
What do you think?

01:01:35.427 --> 01:01:38.722
- I knew it.
- With a staff, you could look after sheep.

01:01:39.306 --> 01:01:40.807
Don't be rude.

01:01:41.891 --> 01:01:43.893
It's a bit sexy, this.

01:01:45.311 --> 01:01:47.104
Well...

01:01:47.230 --> 01:01:50.399
If I were your husband,
I would die of pride.

01:01:50.566 --> 01:01:52.568
You may be right. It is dangerous.

01:01:52.735 --> 01:01:56.530
There's nothing worse at a wedding
than a priest with an erection.

01:02:02.244 --> 01:02:05.247
It's strange thinking
you'll never sleep with anyone else.

01:02:05.455 --> 01:02:09.875
- You don't think you'll be unfaithful?
- No. Not once I'm married.

01:02:10.167 --> 01:02:13.587
I told Hamish I'll kill him if he does,
so I'd better stick to that.

01:02:13.796 --> 01:02:15.214
Quite right.

01:02:15.381 --> 01:02:18.342
Anyway, I reckon I've had my fair run at it.

01:02:19.135 --> 01:02:22.638
What is a fair run these days,
down your way?

01:02:22.847 --> 01:02:25.265
I don't know.

01:02:25.473 --> 01:02:27.475
More than one.

01:02:27.642 --> 01:02:29.853
Well, come on. Tell me.

01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:33.815
I've seen the dress. We have no secrets.

01:02:38.027 --> 01:02:40.028
Well...

01:02:40.904 --> 01:02:46.118
The first one - of course,
not easily forgotten - was kinda nice.

01:02:47.494 --> 01:02:50.080
Two... hairy back.

01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:57.253
Three, four, five... Six was
on my birthday in my parents' room.

01:02:57.795 --> 01:03:00.006
- Which birthday?
- 17th.

01:03:00.214 --> 01:03:03.092
- We've only reached 17?
- I grew up in the country...

01:03:03.301 --> 01:03:05.803
...lots of rolling around in haystacks.

01:03:06.429 --> 01:03:09.431
OK. Seven...

01:03:09.681 --> 01:03:12.684
Eight, unfortunately, was quite a shock.

01:03:13.852 --> 01:03:17.564
Nine, against a fence.
Very uncomfortable. Don't try it.

01:03:17.814 --> 01:03:18.815
I won't.

01:03:18.982 --> 01:03:22.486
Ten was gorgeous. Just heaven, just...

01:03:23.987 --> 01:03:27.281
- He was wonderful.
- I hate him.

01:03:28.532 --> 01:03:31.535
11, obviously after 10, disappointing.

01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:36.499
12 through 17, the university years.
Sensitive, caring, intelligent boys.

01:03:36.665 --> 01:03:39.501
Sexually speaking, a real low patch.

01:03:41.294 --> 01:03:43.588
18 broke my heart.

01:03:43.797 --> 01:03:46.299
- Years of yearning.
- I'm sorry.

01:03:46.508 --> 01:03:49.511
20... Oh, my God!
I can't believe I've reached 20.

01:03:50.762 --> 01:03:53.473
21, elephant tongue.

01:03:55.182 --> 01:03:58.769
22 kept falling asleep.
That was my first year in England.

01:03:59.436 --> 01:04:00.437
I do apologise.

01:04:00.479 --> 01:04:03.440
- 23 and 24 together. That was something.
- Seriously?

01:04:03.690 --> 01:04:05.901
27... That was a mistake.

01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:10.905
- Suddenly at 27 you make a mistake?
- Yes, he kept screaming.

01:04:11.197 --> 01:04:14.283
Very off-putting.
I nearly gave up on the whole thing.

01:04:14.408 --> 01:04:17.119
But Spencer changed my mind. That's 28.

01:04:17.370 --> 01:04:20.289
- His father, 29.
- With his father?

01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:22.416
30.

01:04:23.501 --> 01:04:25.502
31... Oh, my God.

01:04:26.461 --> 01:04:29.548
32 was lovely.

01:04:31.133 --> 01:04:34.553
And then my fiancé, that's 33.

01:04:35.804 --> 01:04:38.098
Wow!

01:04:38.306 --> 01:04:41.809
So I came after your fiancé?

01:04:42.351 --> 01:04:44.770
No, you were 32.

01:04:46.772 --> 01:04:48.566
So there you go.

01:04:48.649 --> 01:04:52.361
Less than Madonna,
more than Princess Di - I hope.

01:04:53.028 --> 01:04:55.530
And how about you?
How many have you slept with?

01:04:55.738 --> 01:04:58.741
Christ! Nothing like that many.
I don't know...

01:04:58.867 --> 01:05:01.870
I don't know what the fuck
I've been doing with my time.

01:05:02.078 --> 01:05:06.374
Work, probably. Yeah, work.
I have been working late a lot.

01:05:14.506 --> 01:05:16.925
I wish I'd rung you.

01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:21.180
But then you never rang me.

01:05:22.222 --> 01:05:25.933
You ruthlessly slept with me twice
and never rang me.

01:05:30.771 --> 01:05:32.648
Bollocks!

01:05:32.857 --> 01:05:35.067
Help me, please! Please!

01:05:47.829 --> 01:05:50.665
Carrie, this is David, my brother.

01:05:54.126 --> 01:05:55.503
Hi.

01:06:09.891 --> 01:06:12.977
I was just telling him
about you marrying Hamish...

01:06:13.228 --> 01:06:16.815
...and he said it couldn't have happened
to a nicer fellow.

01:06:20.485 --> 01:06:22.904
- Where are you doing it?
- Scotland.

01:06:28.075 --> 01:06:31.120
He says that's a beautiful place. Hilly.

01:06:32.287 --> 01:06:34.456
You should come to the wedding, too.

01:06:34.665 --> 01:06:39.794
I want lots of friends to make up for
the gruesome stiffs that Hamish knows.

01:06:40.837 --> 01:06:43.047
Well, you'd better go in.

01:06:43.548 --> 01:06:44.549
Bye.

01:06:45.007 --> 01:06:47.218
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:06:57.602 --> 01:06:59.604
Fuck it!

01:07:12.408 --> 01:07:15.536
Look. Sorry.

01:07:15.661 --> 01:07:19.165
I just... Well...
This is a really stupid question,...

01:07:19.415 --> 01:07:22.209
...particularly in view
of our shopping excursion,...

01:07:22.334 --> 01:07:25.837
...but I just wondered if by any chance...

01:07:28.047 --> 01:07:31.259
Obviously not, because
I've only slept with nine people.

01:07:31.509 --> 01:07:33.720
But I... I just wondered...

01:07:33.928 --> 01:07:36.431
I really feel...

01:07:36.514 --> 01:07:40.809
In short, to recap
in a slightly clearer version,...

01:07:41.101 --> 01:07:45.606
...in the words of David Cassidy,
while still with the Partridge Family,...

01:07:45.898 --> 01:07:48.901
...I think I love you. And...

01:07:49.109 --> 01:07:53.946
...I just wondered whether
by any chance you wouldn't like to...

01:07:57.158 --> 01:08:00.161
No. No, of course not.

01:08:01.788 --> 01:08:04.081
I'm an idiot. He's not.

01:08:04.290 --> 01:08:06.250
Excellent. Fantastic.

01:08:06.417 --> 01:08:09.628
Lovely to see you.
Sorry to disturb. Better get on.

01:08:10.170 --> 01:08:13.298
- Fuck!
- That was very romantic.

01:08:16.676 --> 01:08:20.846
Well, I thought it over a lot, you know.
I wanted to get it just right.

01:08:22.599 --> 01:08:25.309
Important to have said it, I think.

01:08:25.518 --> 01:08:27.853
Said what, exactly?

01:08:29.897 --> 01:08:36.112
Said, you know, what I just said
about David Cassidy.

01:08:40.907 --> 01:08:43.743
You're lovely.

01:09:36.042 --> 01:09:40.629
It was ordained for lifelong faithful
relationships and conjugal love.

01:09:40.796 --> 01:09:43.591
It was ordained
for the welfare of human society,...

01:09:43.841 --> 01:09:45.843
...which can be strong and happy...

01:09:46.051 --> 01:09:49.013
...only when the marriage bond
is held in honour.

01:09:50.055 --> 01:09:54.768
Into this holy estate
these two persons now desire to enter.

01:09:55.935 --> 01:09:58.938
Wherefore, if anyone can show
any just cause...

01:09:59.147 --> 01:10:02.567
...why they may not lawfully
be joined together in marriage,...

01:10:02.776 --> 01:10:04.778
...let him now declare it.

01:10:09.281 --> 01:10:10.949
Sorry.

01:10:11.033 --> 01:10:13.035
Please rise.

01:10:16.038 --> 01:10:20.834
Do you, Hamish, take this woman
Caroline to be your wedded wife...

01:10:21.168 --> 01:10:25.046
...and do you, in the presence of God
and before this congregation,...

01:10:25.338 --> 01:10:29.509
...promise and covenant to be to her
a loving and faithful husband...

01:10:29.801 --> 01:10:32.595
...until God shall separate you by death?

01:10:32.845 --> 01:10:34.722
I do.

01:10:34.889 --> 01:10:39.184
Do you, Caroline, take this man Hamish
to be your wedded husband...

01:10:39.392 --> 01:10:43.188
...and do you, in the presence of God
and before this congregation,...

01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:46.983
...promise and covenant to be to him
a loving and faithful wife...

01:10:47.192 --> 01:10:49.736
...until God shall separate you by death?

01:10:49.861 --> 01:10:50.946
I do.

01:10:53.489 --> 01:10:55.491
Fuck-a-doodle-doo.

01:11:20.807 --> 01:11:23.976
- How awfully nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

01:11:26.770 --> 01:11:28.772
Hello.

01:11:30.399 --> 01:11:33.068
You look beautiful.
Not a meringue in sight.

01:11:33.318 --> 01:11:34.903
Thanks.

01:11:40.616 --> 01:11:42.618
Blimey!

01:11:43.411 --> 01:11:46.539
It's Brigadoon! It's bloody Brigadoon!

01:11:57.507 --> 01:12:00.886
Dear old things, as you know,
I've always been proud...

01:12:01.178 --> 01:12:04.473
...that there's not a wedding ring
between the lot of us.

01:12:04.723 --> 01:12:08.184
Over the passing of the years,
it's beginning to distress me.

01:12:08.434 --> 01:12:12.271
I'd like to go to the wedding
of someone I really loved for a change.

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:15.608
Don't blame me.
I've asked practically everyone I know.

01:12:15.858 --> 01:12:18.444
- You haven't asked me.
- Haven't I?

01:12:18.652 --> 01:12:21.655
Oh, Scarlett... Would you like to?

01:12:21.906 --> 01:12:24.491
No, thank you.
It was very nice of you to ask.

01:12:24.699 --> 01:12:26.493
Well... Any time.

01:12:26.618 --> 01:12:29.496
Quite right, Tom, quite right.
That's the spirit.

01:12:29.746 --> 01:12:32.540
Tonight, these are your orders.

01:12:32.749 --> 01:12:36.753
Go forth and conjugate.
Find husbands and wives.

01:12:37.003 --> 01:12:40.422
Excellent. What do you think, Fifi?
Spot a potential hubby?

01:12:40.672 --> 01:12:42.966
- Bugger off, Tom.
- Quite right.

01:12:43.050 --> 01:12:45.761
A toast before we go into battle.

01:12:47.429 --> 01:12:49.139
True love.

01:12:49.306 --> 01:12:51.683
In whatever shape or form it may come.

01:12:51.809 --> 01:12:56.896
May we all in our dotage be proud to say
"I was adored once, too."

01:12:58.272 --> 01:13:00.858
- True love.
- True love!

01:13:09.366 --> 01:13:12.369
Apparently, an enormous
number of people...

01:13:12.494 --> 01:13:15.789
...actually bump into
their future spouses at weddings,...

01:13:16.039 --> 01:13:17.999
...which is interesting.

01:13:18.083 --> 01:13:20.585
Yes, I met my husband at a wedding.

01:13:28.926 --> 01:13:33.556
Good Lord, I seem to have finished
my drink. If you'll excuse me.

01:13:38.309 --> 01:13:40.937
Hello. My name's Scarlett.

01:13:41.146 --> 01:13:44.149
Named after Scarlett O'Hara,
but much less trouble.

01:13:44.399 --> 01:13:47.318
- What's your name?
- My name's Rhett.

01:13:47.485 --> 01:13:48.903
No...

01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:51.364
- Not really?
- No, not really.

01:13:51.489 --> 01:13:54.450
- In fact, it's Chester.
- You kidder!

01:13:55.826 --> 01:13:59.037
I always imagine Americans
are gonna be dull as shit.

01:13:59.288 --> 01:14:01.290
Of course you're not, are you?

01:14:01.457 --> 01:14:04.042
Steve Martin's American, isn't he?

01:14:04.918 --> 01:14:06.837
Yes, he is.

01:14:07.004 --> 01:14:09.005
You're lovely.

01:14:18.181 --> 01:14:20.558
Hello, Charles.

01:14:20.767 --> 01:14:23.268
Oh, Hen. Hi.

01:14:23.477 --> 01:14:25.979
Look, I couldn't really bear a scene today.

01:14:26.229 --> 01:14:28.899
I know we've probably
got tons to talk about...

01:14:29.065 --> 01:14:31.777
Did I behave that atrociously last time?

01:14:32.778 --> 01:14:35.572
Well, you remember
the shower scene in Psycho?

01:14:36.198 --> 01:14:38.199
Scarier.

01:14:39.116 --> 01:14:41.202
God, I'm depressed, Hen! How are you?

01:14:41.285 --> 01:14:46.499
I'm cheerful. I weigh almost nothing
and I've got a divine new boyfriend.

01:14:49.001 --> 01:14:50.795
Perhaps we should've got married.

01:14:51.003 --> 01:14:55.799
No! I'd have had to marry your friends,
and I'm not sure I could take Fiona.

01:14:56.132 --> 01:14:57.717
Fiona loves you.

01:14:57.801 --> 01:15:01.679
- Fiona calls me Duckface.
- Well, I never heard that.

01:15:01.930 --> 01:15:05.225
Look, darling, come to lunch soon.
Give me a ring.

01:15:05.517 --> 01:15:07.518
Still cute.

01:15:11.730 --> 01:15:13.732
How's Duckface?

01:15:13.941 --> 01:15:16.151
Good form, actually. Not too mad.

01:15:17.694 --> 01:15:22.073
Ladies and gentlemen,
the bride and groom!

01:16:00.025 --> 01:16:02.445
You like this girl, don't you?

01:16:05.030 --> 01:16:07.031
Yes.

01:16:09.534 --> 01:16:11.494
Yes, it's...

01:16:12.412 --> 01:16:15.415
It's a strange thing
when at last it happens.

01:16:15.665 --> 01:16:20.170
And she's marrying someone else.

01:16:28.510 --> 01:16:32.723
How about you, Fifi? Have you
identified a future partner for life yet?

01:16:33.807 --> 01:16:35.809
No need, really.

01:16:37.268 --> 01:16:39.479
The deed is done.

01:16:39.645 --> 01:16:42.732
I've been in love
with the same bloke for ages.

01:16:43.524 --> 01:16:46.277
Have you? Who's that?

01:16:47.862 --> 01:16:50.281
You, Charlie.

01:17:08.631 --> 01:17:10.966
It's always been you.

01:17:12.093 --> 01:17:16.305
Since first we met so many years ago.

01:17:18.557 --> 01:17:20.726
I knew the first moment.

01:17:20.935 --> 01:17:23.853
Across a crowded room. A lawn, in fact.

01:17:29.692 --> 01:17:31.861
Doesn't matter.

01:17:33.029 --> 01:17:36.657
Nothing either of us can do
on this one. Such is life.

01:17:41.703 --> 01:17:44.706
Friends isn't bad, you know.

01:17:44.915 --> 01:17:47.251
Friends is quite something.

01:17:49.211 --> 01:17:51.213
Oh, Fi...

01:18:02.223 --> 01:18:04.600
It's not all easy, is it?

01:18:05.435 --> 01:18:07.436
No.

01:18:09.438 --> 01:18:12.149
Just forget this business. Not to be.

01:18:15.819 --> 01:18:17.904
Matthew, darling.

01:18:18.113 --> 01:18:21.323
- Where's Gareth?
- Torturing Americans.

01:18:22.158 --> 01:18:24.326
How thoughtful of him.

01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:30.458
Do you actually know Oscar Wilde?

01:18:30.666 --> 01:18:33.502
Not personally, no.

01:18:34.003 --> 01:18:38.548
But I do know someone
who could get his fax number for you.

01:18:39.132 --> 01:18:41.134
Shall we dance?

01:19:26.384 --> 01:19:28.970
Well? Any rings on fingers?

01:19:29.096 --> 01:19:31.306
Gareth, you don't know
how lucky you are.

01:19:31.390 --> 01:19:34.101
Finding someone to marry
is a tricky business.

01:19:34.351 --> 01:19:38.854
It's hell out there. Matthew's trapped
with an evangelist from Minnesota.

01:19:39.105 --> 01:19:41.273
Sweet Jesus, cast out the devil!

01:19:42.024 --> 01:19:47.029
My lords, ladies, and gentlemen,
please charge your glasses.

01:19:47.321 --> 01:19:51.199
First, and rather unusually,
we have the bride.

01:19:53.284 --> 01:19:55.703
Excellent. I love this girl.

01:19:56.538 --> 01:19:58.540
Thank you.

01:19:58.706 --> 01:20:03.503
First of all, I'd like to thank all of you
who've flown in from the States.

01:20:04.212 --> 01:20:08.757
As for the rest of you, I'd have thought
that lots of frightful Americans flying in...

01:20:09.049 --> 01:20:12.136
...was an excuse for staying away.
So I thank you, too.

01:20:16.223 --> 01:20:20.810
If my darling dad had been here today,
he would have been speaking now,...

01:20:20.977 --> 01:20:23.104
...and I know what he would have said:

01:20:23.271 --> 01:20:29.110
"Great dress, babe, but why in the hell
are you marrying the stiff in the skirt?"

01:20:31.863 --> 01:20:35.658
And I would have given him
the same answer that I give you:

01:20:35.949 --> 01:20:37.951
"Because I love him."

01:20:38.118 --> 01:20:41.621
As John Lennon said,
who died the same year as my dad,...

01:20:41.872 --> 01:20:45.584
"Love is the answer,
and you know that for sure."

01:20:50.921 --> 01:20:53.424
And one more thing.

01:20:53.632 --> 01:20:57.928
Someone told me here that, if things with
Hamish didn't work out, he would step in.

01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:01.515
I just wanted to say thanks,
and I'll keep you posted.

01:21:06.561 --> 01:21:07.562
Bravo!

01:21:07.729 --> 01:21:11.524
Now, my lords, ladies, and gentlemen,
Sir Hamish Banks.

01:21:18.156 --> 01:21:20.866
Anyone involved in politics
for the last 20 years...

01:21:21.075 --> 01:21:24.078
...has got used to being
upstaged by a woman.

01:21:25.537 --> 01:21:28.624
I didn't expect it to happen to me
on my wedding day.

01:21:28.874 --> 01:21:32.669
However, I must also say
that I'm quite happy...

01:21:32.961 --> 01:21:36.547
...to be upstaged by this woman
for the rest of my life.

01:21:36.798 --> 01:21:41.135
Is that some barracking at the back?
We politicians are used to that.

01:21:41.427 --> 01:21:44.305
- Shit! Find a doctor!
- Right. OK.

01:21:44.430 --> 01:21:47.225
First of all,
my compliments to the bridesmaids.

01:21:47.475 --> 01:21:49.769
You did your duties superbly.

01:21:49.977 --> 01:21:54.272
And obviously I intend to use you
every time I get married from now on.

01:22:00.487 --> 01:22:04.199
I want to thank
all those wonderful ladies of the parish...

01:22:04.449 --> 01:22:06.534
...who did the flowers in the church.

01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:10.830
The stern old building took on
a look of flushed youth today.

01:22:19.463 --> 01:22:22.966
I remember the first time
I laid eyes on Caroline.

01:22:23.216 --> 01:22:27.929
I thought to myself:
"If by any chance she's short-sighted,...

01:22:28.263 --> 01:22:31.558
...I might just be happy
for the rest of my life."

01:22:32.809 --> 01:22:35.602
I thought I could see my future
for the first time.

01:22:35.811 --> 01:22:41.024
It was a joyful one,
for years and years to come.

01:24:12.610 --> 01:24:16.823
Good morning, and a warm welcome
to you all on this cold day.

01:24:17.407 --> 01:24:19.991
Our service will begin in a few minutes.

01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:24.705
But first we have asked Matthew,
Gareth's closest friend,...

01:24:24.996 --> 01:24:27.582
...to say a few words.

01:24:36.048 --> 01:24:39.260
Gareth used to prefer funerals
to weddings.

01:24:39.427 --> 01:24:42.221
He said it was easier to get enthusiastic...

01:24:42.304 --> 01:24:47.226
...about a ceremony one had an outside
chance of eventually being involved in.

01:24:49.228 --> 01:24:52.272
In order to prepare this speech,
I rang a few people...

01:24:52.522 --> 01:24:57.110
...to get a general picture of how Gareth
was regarded by those who met him.

01:24:58.778 --> 01:25:02.574
"Fat" seems to have been a word
people most connected with him.

01:25:04.825 --> 01:25:07.828
"Terribly rude" also rang a lot of bells.

01:25:09.663 --> 01:25:15.461
So "very fat" and "very rude" seems
to have been the stranger's viewpoint.

01:25:15.669 --> 01:25:19.381
But some of you have rung me
and let me know that you loved him,...

01:25:19.756 --> 01:25:23.259
...which I know he would have been
thrilled to hear.

01:25:23.384 --> 01:25:28.556
You remember his fabulous hospitality,
his strange experimental cooking.

01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:35.896
The recipe for duck á la banana
fortunately goes with him to his grave.

01:25:37.564 --> 01:25:42.569
Most of all, you tell me of
his enormous capacity for joy.

01:25:42.986 --> 01:25:48.075
And, when joyful,
for highly vocal drunkenness.

01:25:51.577 --> 01:25:54.747
I hope joyful is how
you will remember him.

01:25:56.957 --> 01:25:59.752
Not stuck in a box in a church.

01:26:03.005 --> 01:26:07.300
Pick your favourite of his waistcoats
and remember him that way.

01:26:07.592 --> 01:26:11.388
The most splendid, replete,...

01:26:12.722 --> 01:26:15.725
...big-hearted...

01:26:16.351 --> 01:26:18.978
...weak-hearted, as it turned out -...

01:26:19.145 --> 01:26:22.147
...and jolly bugger most of us ever met.

01:26:25.317 --> 01:26:28.445
As for me, you may ask
how I will remember him.

01:26:30.030 --> 01:26:32.449
What I thought of him.

01:26:36.619 --> 01:26:39.580
Unfortunately, there I run out of words.

01:26:42.917 --> 01:26:45.128
Forgive me
if I turn from my own feelings...

01:26:45.336 --> 01:26:50.549
...to the words of another
splendid bugger, W.H. Auden.

01:26:51.508 --> 01:26:54.010
This is actually what I want to say:

01:26:57.347 --> 01:27:00.726
Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,

01:27:02.686 --> 01:27:05.896
Prevent the dog from barking
with a juicy bone,

01:27:08.107 --> 01:27:11.193
Silence the pianos
and with muffled drum

01:27:11.402 --> 01:27:15.781
Bring out the coffin,
let the mourners come.

01:27:17.575 --> 01:27:20.285
Let the aeroplanes circle
moaning overhead

01:27:20.368 --> 01:27:24.581
Scribbling on the sky the message
He Is Dead.

01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:30.253
Put crepe bows round the white necks
of the public doves,

01:27:32.505 --> 01:27:35.883
Let traffic policemen
wear black cotton gloves.

01:27:37.676 --> 01:27:41.680
He was my North, my South,
my East and West.

01:27:43.348 --> 01:27:46.518
My working week and my Sunday rest,

01:27:48.312 --> 01:27:52.315
My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;

01:27:55.234 --> 01:27:58.321
I thought that love would last for ever:

01:27:59.405 --> 01:28:01.574
I was wrong.

01:28:04.910 --> 01:28:07.079
The stars are not wanted now:

01:28:08.663 --> 01:28:11.083
Put out every one;

01:28:12.334 --> 01:28:15.337
Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun;

01:28:18.173 --> 01:28:20.925
Pour away the ocean
and sweep up the wood.

01:28:22.927 --> 01:28:26.138
For nothing now
can ever come to any good.

01:29:03.298 --> 01:29:08.010
It was good of you to come. Must have
been the shortest honeymoon in history.

01:29:08.219 --> 01:29:10.722
No, it's fine. We'll do it some other time.

01:29:15.810 --> 01:29:18.021
You know, what you said in the street...

01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:21.440
- Yes, I'm sorry about that.
- No, I liked it.

01:29:21.648 --> 01:29:24.359
I liked you saying it.

01:29:34.869 --> 01:29:37.872
Charlie, I'll take Scarlett home, all right?

01:29:39.373 --> 01:29:41.375
Darling Fi.

01:29:49.799 --> 01:29:51.593
Walk, Charlie?

01:29:51.801 --> 01:29:54.387
Yeah. Yeah, that would be grand.

01:29:57.849 --> 01:30:01.436
Never felt like that.
I mean, something vaguely similar,...

01:30:01.686 --> 01:30:04.521
...for Jilly, when I was young.

01:30:04.730 --> 01:30:06.523
Jilly?

01:30:06.690 --> 01:30:08.692
Labrador.

01:30:10.110 --> 01:30:12.404
Yes, it's odd, isn't it?

01:30:12.613 --> 01:30:15.115
All these years
we've been single and proud of it...

01:30:15.366 --> 01:30:19.952
...and never noticed that two of us were,
in effect, married all this time.

01:30:20.244 --> 01:30:22.580
Traitors in our midst.

01:30:26.417 --> 01:30:30.296
You know, I think death is hardest
for the parents, don't you?

01:30:30.588 --> 01:30:32.882
I hope I die before my children.

01:30:33.091 --> 01:30:34.466
Tom...

01:30:34.549 --> 01:30:37.427
There's one thing I find really...

01:30:40.764 --> 01:30:44.476
Well... It's your total confidence
that you will get married.

01:30:44.726 --> 01:30:48.646
I mean, what if
you never find the right girl?

01:30:48.938 --> 01:30:49.939
Sorry?

01:30:50.064 --> 01:30:53.359
Surely, if that service shows anything,...

01:30:53.609 --> 01:30:56.821
...it shows that there is such a thing
as a perfect match.

01:30:57.029 --> 01:31:01.951
If we can't be like Gareth and Matthew,
then maybe we should just let it go.

01:31:02.993 --> 01:31:05.495
Some of us are not gonna get married.

01:31:05.704 --> 01:31:08.123
Well, I don't know, Charlie.

01:31:08.957 --> 01:31:13.545
The truth is, unlike you,
I never expected the thunderbolt.

01:31:14.754 --> 01:31:18.383
I always just hoped that I'd meet
some nice, friendly girl,...

01:31:18.632 --> 01:31:23.220
...like the look of her, hope the look of me
didn't make her physically sick,...

01:31:23.554 --> 01:31:28.058
...then pop the question
and settle down and be happy.

01:31:29.768 --> 01:31:33.397
It worked for my parents.
Well, apart from the divorce...

01:31:33.980 --> 01:31:36.983
I'll give you six months
at the outside, Tom.

01:31:38.151 --> 01:31:40.570
Yeah, maybe you're right.

01:31:41.154 --> 01:31:47.660
Maybe all this waiting for
one true love stuff gets you nowhere.

01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:08.012
What the fuck is going on?

01:32:11.515 --> 01:32:15.186
I thought we'd better make
absolutely sure we weren't late.

01:32:15.895 --> 01:32:17.605
Excellent wedding hairstyle.

01:32:21.399 --> 01:32:24.861
Matthew.
The best-looking best man in the world.

01:32:25.695 --> 01:32:29.866
Listen. Thank you for doing this today.

01:32:30.033 --> 01:32:32.243
Of course.

01:32:34.661 --> 01:32:37.665
I wish Gareth was here.

01:32:37.748 --> 01:32:39.958
Bet he does, too.

01:32:42.586 --> 01:32:46.090
I'm sorry we're so late.
The others are just parking the car.

01:32:46.340 --> 01:32:48.341
I thought we'd all go with Tom.

01:32:48.508 --> 01:32:52.220
- Late? So late?
- Yeah. It's 9.45.

01:32:52.428 --> 01:32:56.891
- 9.45?
- Yep. 45 minutes till "I do".

01:32:57.183 --> 01:33:00.561
Oh, bloody Tom!
I told him to set the alarm for eight!

01:33:00.770 --> 01:33:02.772
Fuck it! Fuck!

01:33:07.150 --> 01:33:09.861
- Scarlett.
- Hi!

01:33:10.112 --> 01:33:13.490
- You ready?
- Absolutely. Give me 20 seconds.

01:33:23.541 --> 01:33:25.042
- Time.
- Honestly?

01:33:25.209 --> 01:33:26.335
Yes! Time!

01:33:26.502 --> 01:33:28.379
It's about ten to nine.

01:33:46.813 --> 01:33:48.814
Bastards.

01:33:51.066 --> 01:33:53.777
Jessica, stop jumping
up and down, please.

01:33:57.448 --> 01:34:00.075
One, two, three, smile!

01:34:03.286 --> 01:34:07.915
- This is splendid tuck.
- Yes, I think I might say a little word.

01:34:08.207 --> 01:34:12.795
As you know, I've been a close observer
of Charles's love life for many years.

01:34:13.087 --> 01:34:17.883
But recently I'd started to despair and fear
that really he was married to us,...

01:34:18.175 --> 01:34:22.471
...except that we won't have his babies.
- I don't know about that.

01:34:22.637 --> 01:34:26.141
But it's all turned out splendidly.
The girl is sadly crazy,...

01:34:26.641 --> 01:34:28.518
...but perhaps that's why he loves her.

01:34:28.727 --> 01:34:33.522
I'd like to propose a toast to my Charlie
and his beautiful girl on this tragic day.

01:34:33.731 --> 01:34:37.360
- So, be happy and don't forget us.
- Thank you.

01:34:37.610 --> 01:34:41.322
- To Charles and Duckface.
- Charles and Duckface!

01:34:47.703 --> 01:34:49.996
- What do you think?
- You look divine.

01:34:50.205 --> 01:34:52.582
It does work, doesn't it? Yes.

01:34:55.835 --> 01:34:59.839
I'd like to thank Fiona for those
charming words about my future wife.

01:35:00.006 --> 01:35:04.093
I'd like to take this opportunity
to read a message from her to you all.

01:35:04.385 --> 01:35:05.969
This is exciting.

01:35:06.136 --> 01:35:10.140
She says "Any of you come near
the house, I'll set the dogs on you."

01:35:10.432 --> 01:35:13.060
I think that's a nice touch.

01:35:13.268 --> 01:35:15.145
Sweet!

01:35:15.354 --> 01:35:17.772
"Set the dogs on you"!

01:35:19.148 --> 01:35:21.359
John, hi.

01:35:21.442 --> 01:35:23.444
- John, you made it.
- Yes.

01:35:23.653 --> 01:35:27.365
I hope me damn sister turns up.
Not much of a wedding without a bride.

01:35:27.490 --> 01:35:29.117
Tom!

01:35:30.034 --> 01:35:32.453
Bit of a poor show
you not having a stag night.

01:35:32.537 --> 01:35:37.749
We did! We did... We didn't think it was
a very good idea in this day and age.

01:35:38.041 --> 01:35:40.043
Really?

01:35:59.854 --> 01:36:02.356
Fi, you do look lovely today.

01:36:02.564 --> 01:36:07.652
- I've abandoned my traditional black.
- Yes, so you have.

01:36:07.986 --> 01:36:10.780
From now on, I shall be
all the colours of the rainbow...

01:36:11.031 --> 01:36:15.118
...and fall in love with someone
who fancies me for a change.

01:36:15.410 --> 01:36:17.412
Darling Fi!

01:36:24.585 --> 01:36:26.295
- Look.
- What?

01:36:26.337 --> 01:36:29.131
Lipstick everywhere. That won't do at all.

01:36:32.592 --> 01:36:34.594
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:36:50.942 --> 01:36:52.944
Good luck.

01:36:58.033 --> 01:37:00.535
Hello. Glad you could come.

01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:04.288
Groom's on the right. Bride's on the left.

01:37:08.042 --> 01:37:11.629
- Groom on the right. Bride on the left.
- Oh, my God!

01:37:16.092 --> 01:37:18.760
I thought you'd gone back to Texas.

01:37:18.885 --> 01:37:20.970
Without you, never.

01:37:25.558 --> 01:37:27.560
Good luck.

01:37:31.439 --> 01:37:33.440
Bride or groom?

01:37:35.693 --> 01:37:37.653
Bride or groom?

01:37:37.945 --> 01:37:42.449
It should be perfectly obvious I'm neither.
Great God!

01:37:43.701 --> 01:37:46.328
- Bride or groom?
- Bride.

01:37:56.504 --> 01:37:58.631
Yes...

01:37:58.715 --> 01:38:00.425
I'm fine.

01:38:03.093 --> 01:38:05.512
I've a feeling we've met before.

01:38:05.595 --> 01:38:08.515
We have. About 25 years ago.

01:38:09.391 --> 01:38:12.728
I'm second cousin Harold's
daughter Deirdre. You're Tom.

01:38:12.978 --> 01:38:14.563
Good Lord!

01:38:14.771 --> 01:38:17.064
- So, you're family.
- Yes.

01:38:17.982 --> 01:38:21.986
- Only very distant.
- Well, yes, of course.

01:38:23.738 --> 01:38:26.824
You said you were bride?

01:38:27.074 --> 01:38:28.409
Yes.

01:38:28.534 --> 01:38:30.536
Well, do sit.

01:38:30.911 --> 01:38:33.330
Do sit here, Deirdre.

01:38:37.792 --> 01:38:39.836
Golly!

01:38:40.462 --> 01:38:42.255
Thunderbolt city.

01:38:43.340 --> 01:38:45.759
- Hello, Matthew.
- Nice to see you.

01:38:45.967 --> 01:38:48.844
- Hello, Charles.
- Bernard. How are you?

01:38:48.969 --> 01:38:51.555
- Exhausted, actually.
- Oh, bunny!

01:38:51.805 --> 01:38:53.807
- Charles.
- Hello, Lyd.

01:38:59.605 --> 01:39:01.607
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:39:03.358 --> 01:39:07.487
You look lovely. But then I always
did like you dressed for weddings.

01:39:07.945 --> 01:39:11.532
- And on time.
- Yeah. Extraordinary thing, isn't it?

01:39:11.908 --> 01:39:16.412
- How's Hamish?
- He's fine... I believe.

01:39:16.704 --> 01:39:19.039
- You believe?
- Well, yes.

01:39:19.206 --> 01:39:21.792
He wasn't the man for me after all.

01:39:24.628 --> 01:39:27.422
- You left him?
- We left each other.

01:39:30.467 --> 01:39:34.261
- When?
- A few months now.

01:39:34.553 --> 01:39:38.057
March was hell. By April, it was sordid.

01:39:38.265 --> 01:39:42.186
That's the last time
I marry someone three times my age.

01:39:42.478 --> 01:39:45.106
Charles, time to travel.

01:39:45.272 --> 01:39:47.273
Yeah.

01:39:49.150 --> 01:39:51.361
Coming. Good.

01:39:54.656 --> 01:39:59.244
- So why didn't you get in touch, then?
- I did think about it.

01:39:59.452 --> 01:40:03.539
I wanted to, but I was in a state.

01:40:05.290 --> 01:40:08.002
So, anyway, I don't want to keep you.

01:40:09.586 --> 01:40:12.006
And I'll see you afterwards.

01:40:12.172 --> 01:40:14.008
Yeah. Fine.

01:40:14.049 --> 01:40:16.051
Wait.

01:40:20.722 --> 01:40:22.724
I'll show you to your seat.

01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:27.020
Just showing her to her seat.

01:40:39.573 --> 01:40:42.075
Our timing's been really bad, hasn't it?

01:40:42.326 --> 01:40:44.828
It's been bad, yes.

01:40:44.911 --> 01:40:47.121
It's been a disaster.

01:40:47.330 --> 01:40:51.917
It has, as you say,
been very bad indeed.

01:40:56.797 --> 01:40:59.425
God, it's lovely to see you.

01:41:01.801 --> 01:41:04.012
Well, good luck.

01:41:04.220 --> 01:41:09.309
It's pretty easy. Just say "I do"
whenever anyone asks you a question.

01:41:18.484 --> 01:41:21.195
Could you just give me a sec, Matthew?

01:41:21.403 --> 01:41:24.490
Yes, of course. Freshen up at will.

01:41:43.841 --> 01:41:45.843
Dear Lord,..

01:41:46.010 --> 01:41:51.515
...forgive me for what I'm about to say...

01:41:51.848 --> 01:41:56.269
...in this magnificent place of worship.

01:41:56.561 --> 01:41:58.355
Bugger!

01:41:59.690 --> 01:42:01.691
Bugger!

01:42:08.114 --> 01:42:10.324
Can I help at all?

01:42:11.283 --> 01:42:13.452
No. Thanks.

01:42:13.577 --> 01:42:14.787
Sorry.

01:42:16.122 --> 01:42:18.623
Vocal exercises. Big church.

01:42:18.832 --> 01:42:21.334
Excellent. Often do the same myself.

01:42:21.584 --> 01:42:26.506
Not exactly the same vocab, obviously.
Rather more alleluias.

01:42:26.673 --> 01:42:28.883
I'll leave you.

01:42:47.025 --> 01:42:49.152
- Bride's arriving.
- Fabulous!

01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:51.738
We seem to have lost the groom.

01:42:52.322 --> 01:42:56.242
- Stall her and I'll see if I can find him.
- Roger. Wilco.

01:43:03.790 --> 01:43:05.792
Charles.

01:43:07.252 --> 01:43:09.630
It's good to see you.

01:43:11.923 --> 01:43:14.259
Yeah.

01:43:16.093 --> 01:43:19.305
Matt, what do we think about marriage?

01:43:20.306 --> 01:43:23.476
Well... Gosh!

01:43:23.643 --> 01:43:28.397
Well, I think it's really good,
if you love the person with all your heart.

01:43:30.066 --> 01:43:33.276
Well, exactly. Quite.

01:43:36.738 --> 01:43:40.659
All these weddings. All these years.

01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:45.372
All that blasted salmon and champagne.

01:43:45.497 --> 01:43:51.543
Here I am on my own wedding day
and I'm still thinking.

01:43:52.378 --> 01:43:54.588
Can I ask about what?

01:43:57.633 --> 01:43:59.510
No.

01:43:59.677 --> 01:44:01.678
No, I think best not.

01:44:02.387 --> 01:44:05.598
I'm sorry, there's a delay.
A problem with the flowers.

01:44:06.057 --> 01:44:07.141
Flowers?

01:44:07.183 --> 01:44:11.062
There seems to be a staggeringly
high proportion of hay fever sufferers...

01:44:11.396 --> 01:44:16.274
...and they're right next to the flowers,
so we're moving the congregation.

01:44:16.608 --> 01:44:18.902
Don't want the vows
obliterated by sneezing.

01:44:19.111 --> 01:44:23.282
Charles, would it be out of place
for me to say that time is ticking by?

01:44:49.347 --> 01:44:51.141
I think I've fooled them so far.

01:44:51.308 --> 01:44:54.394
When people think you're stupid,
they're less suspicious.

01:45:17.915 --> 01:45:20.084
Hello.

01:45:20.209 --> 01:45:21.794
Here you are!

01:45:21.961 --> 01:45:24.172
Ready to face the enemy?

01:45:26.049 --> 01:45:28.051
Are we?

01:45:31.553 --> 01:45:33.555
Yes.

01:45:35.015 --> 01:45:37.017
Excellent.

01:46:31.401 --> 01:46:33.403
Not so tight, Dad.

01:47:02.179 --> 01:47:06.559
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
together here in the sight of God...

01:47:06.767 --> 01:47:09.353
...and in the face of this congregation...

01:47:09.478 --> 01:47:12.857
...to join together this man
and this woman in holy matrimony,...

01:47:13.107 --> 01:47:18.612
...which is an honourable estate, instituted
of God in the time of man's innocence,...

01:47:18.945 --> 01:47:24.242
...signifying unto us the mystical union
that is betwixt Christ and his Church...

01:47:25.035 --> 01:47:27.996
...and therefore is not
by any to be enterprised...

01:47:28.246 --> 01:47:31.832
...nor taken in hand unadvisedly,
lightly, or wantonly,...

01:47:32.082 --> 01:47:35.377
...but reverently, discreetly, advisedly,...

01:47:35.628 --> 01:47:37.129
...soberly,...

01:47:37.212 --> 01:47:39.214
...and in the fear of God.

01:47:40.007 --> 01:47:42.593
Therefore, if any man
can show any just cause...

01:47:42.843 --> 01:47:45.428
...why they may not
lawfully be joined together,...

01:47:45.637 --> 01:47:49.933
...let him speak now or else hereafter
for ever hold his peace.

01:47:55.146 --> 01:47:58.775
I'm sorry.
Does someone have something to say?

01:48:04.821 --> 01:48:06.990
Yes? What is it?

01:48:09.117 --> 01:48:10.619
One second.

01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:29.220
He wants me to
translate what he's saying.

01:48:29.428 --> 01:48:31.221
What is he saying?

01:48:33.932 --> 01:48:37.143
He says "I suspect the groom
is having doubts."

01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:39.646
"I suspect the groom would like to delay."

01:48:44.567 --> 01:48:46.360
"I suspect the groom..."

01:48:58.539 --> 01:49:00.540
What's he saying?

01:49:03.334 --> 01:49:05.628
He says...

01:49:05.837 --> 01:49:09.841
...he suspects the groom
loves someone else.

01:49:12.135 --> 01:49:13.595
Do you?

01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:16.513
Do you love someone else?
Do you, Charles?

01:49:28.358 --> 01:49:30.026
I do.

01:49:36.073 --> 01:49:38.075
Get out of my way! Let me kill him!

01:49:48.376 --> 01:49:50.378
Blimey!

01:49:52.005 --> 01:49:54.299
At least it's one we won't forget.

01:49:54.424 --> 01:49:57.302
A lot of weddings just
blend into each other.

01:49:57.552 --> 01:50:01.138
- For God's sake!
- This one will stick out in the memory.

01:50:01.305 --> 01:50:04.099
For not actually including
a wedding service.

01:50:04.308 --> 01:50:06.936
Poor girl. No, I mean it. Poor girl.

01:50:07.144 --> 01:50:11.148
She's not my favourite person, but I think
what you did today was unforgivable.

01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:13.734
I can't bear to think about it.

01:50:14.859 --> 01:50:16.361
Poor Hen.

01:50:16.527 --> 01:50:19.948
- Though let's face facts.
- I'm sorry.

01:50:20.198 --> 01:50:23.868
If you weren't sure you wanted
to marry her today of all days,...

01:50:24.118 --> 01:50:27.205
...i. e., your wedding day,...

01:50:27.330 --> 01:50:30.832
...then it must be the right decision,
mustn't it?

01:50:31.750 --> 01:50:32.751
Quite right.

01:50:32.876 --> 01:50:36.880
It was a lovely dress.
I'm sure she'll find it useful for parties.

01:50:40.717 --> 01:50:44.428
- What did he say, Charles?
- Says he blames himself.

01:50:44.679 --> 01:50:47.265
- Absolutely not.
- No, you mustn't, David.

01:50:50.726 --> 01:50:54.146
- It's OK.
- No, no. If there's music to be faced,...

01:50:54.397 --> 01:50:56.732
...I should be facing it.

01:51:05.615 --> 01:51:07.534
Hello.

01:51:07.742 --> 01:51:10.745
- Hi! You're soaking. Come in.
- No, I'm fine.

01:51:10.954 --> 01:51:13.039
Comes a point when you can't get wetter.

01:51:13.248 --> 01:51:16.041
- OK, I'll come out.
- No, please don't. I...

01:51:16.292 --> 01:51:18.877
I just wanted to check you're OK.

01:51:19.086 --> 01:51:22.381
Not busy killing yourself
or anything, but...

01:51:24.133 --> 01:51:26.510
But you're fine, so...

01:51:28.304 --> 01:51:31.973
I shouldn't have come
to the church this morning. I'm sorry.

01:51:32.807 --> 01:51:34.809
No!

01:51:35.560 --> 01:51:39.856
Wait. It was all my fault.
I mean, I'm the bastard here.

01:51:41.608 --> 01:51:43.610
And it sorted out one thing.

01:51:43.693 --> 01:51:47.863
Marriage and me were very clearly
not meant for one another.

01:51:48.196 --> 01:51:50.198
It sorted out another big thing, too.

01:51:50.365 --> 01:51:53.285
There I was,
standing there in the church,...

01:51:53.493 --> 01:51:56.788
...and for the first time
in my whole life I realised I...

01:51:57.039 --> 01:52:00.374
...totally and utterly loved one person.

01:52:00.583 --> 01:52:03.002
And it wasn't the person
next to me in the veil.

01:52:03.210 --> 01:52:06.756
It's the person standing opposite me now...

01:52:09.008 --> 01:52:10.426
...in the rain.

01:52:10.593 --> 01:52:13.179
Is it still raining? I hadn't noticed.

01:52:13.429 --> 01:52:18.016
The truth of it is, I've loved you
from the first second I met you.

01:52:19.142 --> 01:52:24.940
- Not going away again, are you?
- No. I might drown. But otherwise, no.

01:52:25.273 --> 01:52:27.776
OK. OK. We'll go in.

01:52:30.945 --> 01:52:33.447
But first let me ask you one thing.

01:52:35.658 --> 01:52:39.161
Do you think, after we've dried off,...

01:52:39.703 --> 01:52:44.082
...after we've spent lots more
time together, you might agree...

01:52:46.042 --> 01:52:48.336
...not to marry me?

01:52:48.544 --> 01:52:51.172
And do you think...

01:52:51.339 --> 01:52:56.261
...not being married to me might maybe
be something you could consider...

01:52:56.552 --> 01:52:59.054
...doing for the rest of your life?

01:53:03.976 --> 01:53:06.395
Do you?

01:53:08.188 --> 01:53:10.399
I do.
