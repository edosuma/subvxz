00:00.192 --> 00:02.193
<i>Previously on</i> Beauty & the Beast...

00:08.096 --> 00:09.565
CATHERINE: <i>Agent Thomas was shot</i>

00:09.599 --> 00:11.500
and killed in a locked hospital room.

00:11.535 --> 00:14.003
Another serum-enhanced
superhuman took him out,

00:14.037 --> 00:15.437
<i>which means whoever's behind this</i>

00:15.471 --> 00:18.007
doesn't want us to know
what Agent Thomas knew.

00:18.041 --> 00:19.608
We have to stop whoever's behind this

00:19.643 --> 00:21.309
before someone else gets hurt.

00:21.344 --> 00:23.412
JT: <i>I've gone over my medical
records a dozen times.</i>

00:23.446 --> 00:25.647
There's no way I should have
survived that. I should be dead.

00:25.681 --> 00:27.115
<i>I can't ignore the fact</i>

00:27.150 --> 00:28.583
<i>that the same serum that saved me was</i>

00:28.617 --> 00:30.218
<i>the same exact strain found</i>

00:30.253 --> 00:32.753
- in the other victims.
- The other superhuman victims.

00:32.788 --> 00:34.423
(computer chirps, explosive pop)

00:34.457 --> 00:36.324
(groaning)

00:39.262 --> 00:41.095
What?

00:46.168 --> 00:48.703
Uh, I'm sorry. Just give me a second?

00:48.737 --> 00:51.706
- That's fine.
- Sure.

00:51.805 --> 00:55.207
I'm really glad we
finally decided to do this.

00:55.242 --> 00:57.709
Yeah, me, too.

01:00.180 --> 01:02.281
I still think we're missing
something with Zalman.

01:02.315 --> 01:05.384
- Catherine, I thought we were past all that.
- I'm sorry,

01:05.418 --> 01:07.353
but I don't understand why
someone would steal a heart

01:07.387 --> 01:09.054
and just leave it in a freezer.

01:09.088 --> 01:10.055
Excuse me?

01:10.089 --> 01:12.291
Oh, uh, no, it's just...

01:12.325 --> 01:14.526
It's... it's about a case, not about us.

01:14.560 --> 01:16.494
Well, it kind of is about us.

01:16.529 --> 01:18.463
I mean, it's the reason we finally decided

01:18.497 --> 01:20.732
- to come here, right?
- Not really.

01:22.969 --> 01:25.503
I mean, yeah, okay, I think

01:25.538 --> 01:28.040
that you obsess about cases,
and you think I avoid them.

01:28.074 --> 01:30.041
Uh, look, uh,

01:30.075 --> 01:32.510
Vincent and, uh, Catherine?

01:32.545 --> 01:34.745
Cat. You can... you can just call me Cat.

01:34.816 --> 01:38.051
Okay. Uh, look, uh,
couples don't always know

01:38.086 --> 01:41.455
exactly what it is that brings
them to marriage counseling,

01:41.489 --> 01:42.523
but the fact that you wanted to come,

01:42.557 --> 01:44.658
that... that's a positive step.

01:44.693 --> 01:46.626
It says how much you both
value the relationship,

01:46.660 --> 01:49.329
how badly you want it to succeed.

01:49.363 --> 01:51.631
So why don't we start at the
beginning? How'd you first meet?

01:51.665 --> 01:55.301
Oh. Um...

01:55.336 --> 01:56.770
(growling)

01:59.707 --> 02:00.707
(growling)

02:02.143 --> 02:04.210
(gasps)

02:04.245 --> 02:05.778
You know what? We're in a bit of a rush,

02:05.812 --> 02:07.313
- so maybe if we could just...
- Skip ahead.

02:07.348 --> 02:08.580
Yeah, maybe... maybe to our fight.

02:08.616 --> 02:10.049
It wasn't a fight.

02:10.083 --> 02:11.183
It was a disagreement.

02:11.218 --> 02:12.352
CATHERINE: It was, too, a fight.

02:12.386 --> 02:14.086
You didn't even want to take the case.

02:14.121 --> 02:16.522
- Could I...?
- I was working a double shift.

02:16.627 --> 02:18.695
That is not the reason.
That is not the reason.

02:18.729 --> 02:20.029
He was avoiding it,

02:20.063 --> 02:21.897
just like he avoided coming here.

02:21.932 --> 02:24.900
Me? You wouldn't even take
the time to come here, either.

02:24.935 --> 02:26.468
I mean, ever since she's
had this greater purpose,

02:26.502 --> 02:27.870
all she wants to do

02:27.904 --> 02:29.371
is case after case after case.

02:29.405 --> 02:30.873
Bob and Carol just tried

02:30.907 --> 02:32.208
to kill us, Vincent, and
they're still out there.

02:32.242 --> 02:33.475
We can't just ignore that.

02:33.509 --> 02:35.144
COUNSELOR: Um...

02:35.178 --> 02:37.512
I'm... I'm sorry.
Someone tried to kill you?

02:37.637 --> 02:38.937
Bob and Carol.

02:38.971 --> 02:40.405
I was investigating a lead,

02:40.740 --> 02:42.641
- trying to save him.
- Me?

02:42.675 --> 02:45.043
That's what this is about,
right? You always saving me?

02:45.077 --> 02:47.145
No, no, it is... Maybe.

02:47.179 --> 02:48.513
COUNSELOR: Okay, clearly,

02:48.548 --> 02:50.381
uh, you both have

02:50.416 --> 02:52.984
avoidance issues, and this...

02:53.018 --> 02:56.520
<i>case</i> seems to have brought
them to a head, but in order for me

02:56.555 --> 02:59.490
to better understand what it
is you're both really avoiding,

02:59.524 --> 03:02.927
why don't we start with
what caused this fight?

03:02.962 --> 03:06.130
Disagreement.

03:06.201 --> 03:10.971
Catherine, I can't really
fight about it right now.

03:11.005 --> 03:12.973
Uh, it's probably just dislocated,

03:13.007 --> 03:14.908
but you'd better take
him through X-ray anyway.

03:14.942 --> 03:16.442
You'll be fine, okay?

03:16.477 --> 03:18.111
It's not a fight, it
may not even be a case,

03:18.145 --> 03:19.913
<i>but I think that we should
look into it, don't you?</i>

03:19.947 --> 03:21.648
I mean, with Bob and Carol still
out there trying to kill us,

03:21.682 --> 03:23.049
<i>we should explore every
possible connection.</i>

03:23.083 --> 03:25.118
<i>Okay, right, but it's been over two weeks,</i>

03:25.152 --> 03:27.553
and they still haven't
come after us, have they?

03:27.587 --> 03:29.455
Still, that doesn't mean
that they won't, which means,

03:29.490 --> 03:31.457
<i>as soon as we figure out who
they're working for, the better.</i>

03:31.492 --> 03:33.659
Captain in?

03:33.693 --> 03:35.161
Look, Cat, I'm working a double shift.

03:35.195 --> 03:36.896
I'm sorry I can't talk right now.

03:36.930 --> 03:38.564
One that you volunteered for, by the way.

03:38.598 --> 03:40.633
Yeah, right, because of
all the time I've taken off

03:40.667 --> 03:42.001
<i>for all the other cases</i>

03:42.035 --> 03:43.536
that I'm trying to make up time for.

03:43.570 --> 03:45.771
You're not avoiding me, are you?

03:45.805 --> 03:48.073
What? Come on, where's this coming from?

03:48.107 --> 03:50.776
I don't know. It's just,
ever since we decided

03:50.810 --> 03:52.277
<i>to postpone the wedding...</i>

03:52.311 --> 03:54.013
Yeah, because <i>we</i> decided
that <i>we</i> were rushing things.

03:54.047 --> 03:55.981
I know. I'm not blaming you.

03:56.016 --> 03:59.117
It's just, we haven't really
made time for us lately.

03:59.152 --> 04:01.253
<i>If it wasn't for chasing down</i>

04:01.287 --> 04:02.921
superhuman experiments,

04:02.955 --> 04:05.857
we'd barely even see each other anymore.

04:05.891 --> 04:06.958
<i>How are we gonna</i>

04:06.992 --> 04:08.427
get married if we don't even

04:08.461 --> 04:10.095
have time to be engaged?

04:10.129 --> 04:13.965
Ah, okay, okay, you're
right, you're right. Um,

04:13.999 --> 04:15.099
<i>9:00,</i>

04:15.133 --> 04:16.434
Zalman Plaza.

04:16.468 --> 04:17.601
9:00.

04:17.636 --> 04:19.136
And, Cat, for the record,

04:19.171 --> 04:20.772
I really hope this turns out

04:20.805 --> 04:23.174
to be more of a date night
than a case night, okay?

04:23.208 --> 04:25.342
Me, too.

04:27.046 --> 04:30.147
Uh, no, I'm excited for the challenge.

04:30.182 --> 04:31.715
Yes, thank you, my dad <i>would</i> be proud.

04:31.749 --> 04:33.717
Tess, I've got a lead.

04:33.751 --> 04:35.453
(whispers): Sorry.

04:35.487 --> 04:37.221
No, uh, Chief,

04:37.255 --> 04:39.022
I promise, I won't let you down.

04:39.057 --> 04:41.492
All right, and thanks
again for the opportunity.

04:41.526 --> 04:44.261
No bizarro cases, Cat.

04:44.395 --> 04:46.630
Not my first week, please.
I'm nervous enough as it is.

04:46.664 --> 04:48.565
Are you kidding? You're doing great.

04:48.600 --> 04:50.000
You were born to be captain.

04:50.034 --> 04:52.168
And you're buttering me up.

04:52.203 --> 04:54.537
Cat, I'm begging you. Come on, Tess.

04:54.572 --> 04:56.673
Who commits suicide by
drilling a hole in her head?

04:56.708 --> 04:59.743
- What?
- I've discovered a victim who just happens

04:59.777 --> 05:01.645
to be an organ donor with
a very rare blood type,

05:01.679 --> 05:03.747
who also just happens to be the
perfect match for a billionaire

05:03.781 --> 05:06.716
who is in desperate need
of a heart transplant.

05:06.750 --> 05:08.951
So, what, you think he had...
you think he had her killed

05:08.986 --> 05:10.753
by... by drilling a hole in her head?

05:10.787 --> 05:13.022
Well, it makes more sense
than suicide, doesn't it?

05:13.056 --> 05:15.492
All right, where was the victim found?

05:15.526 --> 05:20.930
In her locked apartment with,
you know, a drill in her hand.

05:22.966 --> 05:24.700
But it doesn't make sense.

05:24.735 --> 05:26.568
Which makes it a potential murder,

05:26.603 --> 05:28.170
which means that you, as captain...

05:28.204 --> 05:29.772
Okay, all right, all right.
You're trying too hard.

05:29.806 --> 05:32.508
Look, Cat, we are best
friends, and me as captain

05:32.542 --> 05:35.711
doesn't change that,
and I know that I owe you

05:35.746 --> 05:37.379
for this job, okay, but

05:37.413 --> 05:41.283
you have to respect my new position, okay?

05:41.317 --> 05:43.385
- It changes things.
- I know.

05:43.419 --> 05:45.554
I know, but what doesn't change

05:45.588 --> 05:47.623
is that there's still someone out there

05:47.657 --> 05:49.724
experimenting on innocents,

05:49.759 --> 05:53.295
killing them, which means, bizarro or not,

05:53.329 --> 05:56.197
we have to do everything
we can to stop it, don't we?

05:57.531 --> 05:59.206
All right, so this billionaire...

05:59.210 --> 06:00.635
Zalman. Marshall Zalman.

06:00.670 --> 06:03.071
You think Zalman is somehow
involved in these experiments?

06:03.105 --> 06:05.440
For all I know, he's the one behind it.

06:05.474 --> 06:08.142
I mean, he has the money, the means,

06:08.177 --> 06:10.178
and he has a track
record that fits the M.O.

06:10.212 --> 06:12.346
of someone who will do
anything to get more power.

06:12.380 --> 06:15.015
That's pretty circumstantial, Cat.

06:15.049 --> 06:17.250
I still don't see the connection.

06:17.285 --> 06:18.719
Vincent and I are gonna go

06:18.753 --> 06:20.788
on a date to the fund-raiser
that's Zalman's hosting

06:20.822 --> 06:23.357
at his hotel. I want to go see
what I can, you know, suss out.

06:23.391 --> 06:24.725
MAN: Captain, I've got

06:24.759 --> 06:26.293
- the DA's office on line five?
- Okay.

06:26.327 --> 06:28.428
- (door closes)
- All right, go suss.

06:28.463 --> 06:30.230
Keep me posted.

06:30.264 --> 06:32.699
Cat...

06:32.733 --> 06:35.068
this better not bite me in the ass.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.936
No.

06:38.139 --> 06:40.907
Oh, Alex, has JT...?

06:40.941 --> 06:42.775
I mean, Professor Forbes...
has he called back yet?

06:42.810 --> 06:50.416
No, not yet.

06:50.450 --> 06:51.711
(sighs)

06:51.725 --> 06:53.993
(phone ringing)

06:54.028 --> 06:56.029
Heather, great, you're here?

06:58.332 --> 07:00.033
Okay, I'll be right down.

07:00.067 --> 07:02.068
(phone beeps)

07:05.673 --> 07:07.840
This better work.

07:12.445 --> 07:14.113
(groaning)

07:15.716 --> 07:18.817
Ow.

07:18.851 --> 07:19.985
(siren blaring)

07:20.019 --> 07:22.754
(horns honking)

07:22.789 --> 07:24.956
(chatter and laughter)

07:28.139 --> 07:29.940
Hey, there's Zalman.

07:29.974 --> 07:32.008
VINCENT: Yeah?

07:32.043 --> 07:34.410
Oh, yeah, yeah, he really
fits the description

07:34.445 --> 07:36.312
of a big bad criminal, Catherine.

07:36.347 --> 07:38.681
Wheelchair-bound
billionaire philanthropist,

07:38.716 --> 07:39.816
needs a new heart.

07:39.851 --> 07:41.417
And, lo and behold, finds one

07:41.452 --> 07:44.387
in the only other AB Rh
negative donor in Manhattan.

07:44.421 --> 07:46.857
Who, by the way, showed
no signs of depression

07:46.891 --> 07:48.725
and, in fact, was training for a marathon

07:48.760 --> 07:50.960
just days before she
supposedly killed herself.

07:50.994 --> 07:52.362
Thought so.

07:52.476 --> 07:54.944
This never really was a date, was it?

07:57.214 --> 07:59.482
Okay, case-wise, if Zalman

07:59.516 --> 08:02.452
is behind this, then where is

08:02.486 --> 08:04.520
the serum-enhanced superhuman, Catherine?

08:04.555 --> 08:06.989
Well, Zalman wasn't
always a pillar of society.

08:07.003 --> 08:09.071
Maybe he's behind the
experiments for himself,

08:09.105 --> 08:10.472
to save his own life.

08:10.506 --> 08:14.076
What? What? JT was miraculously saved

08:14.110 --> 08:17.413
by the serum, and... and now he
can heal his own bullet wounds.

08:17.447 --> 08:19.581
Okay, yes, but listen to me.

08:19.615 --> 08:21.383
Don't you worry that this is all

08:21.418 --> 08:23.384
we ever do together anymore, just cases?

08:23.419 --> 08:26.154
Is that what you think? Well,
you're the one who said it first,

08:26.188 --> 08:28.189
right, and the more I think about it...

08:28.223 --> 08:30.291
I mean, what are we really doing here?

08:30.326 --> 08:31.726
Okay, especially since, frankly,

08:31.761 --> 08:34.496
it sounds to me like
you're grasping at straws.

08:34.530 --> 08:37.832
Well, at least I'm not avoiding straws.

08:37.866 --> 08:40.068
(sighs)

08:41.437 --> 08:43.203
Cath... Catherine, Catherine, no.

08:43.238 --> 08:44.405
No, no, no, Catherine.

08:44.440 --> 08:45.906
No! No!

08:45.941 --> 08:47.342
Excuse me, Marshall Zalman?

08:47.376 --> 08:49.210
Detective Chandler, NYPD.

08:49.244 --> 08:50.445
- WOMAN: What is this?
- Catherine, Catherine.

08:50.479 --> 08:51.846
I have a few questions.

08:51.880 --> 08:53.348
Can't this wait?

08:53.382 --> 08:55.516
It's all right, honey. Um, turn me around.

09:01.089 --> 09:02.790
What's this about, Detective?

09:03.892 --> 09:05.258
It's about your donor.

09:05.293 --> 09:06.894
Hey, Catherine, this isn't the time.

09:06.928 --> 09:09.062
He is gonna get a new
heart tomorrow, Vincent.

09:09.097 --> 09:11.298
If not now, then when?

09:11.332 --> 09:14.767
I know nothing about the donor.

09:14.802 --> 09:16.970
Really? Even the fact that
she may have been murdered?

09:17.005 --> 09:19.373
- What?!
- Breathe, Marshall.

09:19.407 --> 09:22.242
Relax. Are you out of your mind?

09:22.276 --> 09:23.910
All right, I think we
should go now. Come on.

09:23.944 --> 09:27.147
Vincent, a woman was killed so
that he could have her heart,

09:27.181 --> 09:28.515
and since recipients aren't supposed

09:28.549 --> 09:30.049
to know who their donors are,

09:30.083 --> 09:31.417
I would like to know if you did.

09:31.451 --> 09:33.786
- I insist you leave now.
- Okay, Catherine,

09:33.821 --> 09:35.454
as a doctor, I'm telling
you this is not a good time.

09:35.489 --> 09:37.423
CATHERINE: And I am telling you,

09:37.457 --> 09:39.592
as a cop, I do not have a choice.

09:41.094 --> 09:44.463
All right. Yes.

09:45.665 --> 09:47.333
I knew who the donor was.

09:47.367 --> 09:50.069
Because I had my people search.

09:50.103 --> 09:51.504
I had to know if I had a chance.

09:51.538 --> 09:54.173
I had to know

09:54.207 --> 09:55.908
- if there were people out there...
- So, what, you had her killed?

09:55.942 --> 09:59.011
- No! I had no idea that... (groans)
- Calm down, Marshall.

09:59.046 --> 10:02.748
CATHERINE: You still think
I'm grasping at straws?

10:02.782 --> 10:04.616
Is that was this is about,
you trying to prove me wrong?

10:04.651 --> 10:06.217
No, you didn't believe me.
You didn't want to come here!

10:06.252 --> 10:07.586
That's not true. I just, I didn't want...

10:07.620 --> 10:09.421
tonight to be about what it's always about!

10:09.455 --> 10:12.190
Okay, so, if you don't like something, then

10:12.224 --> 10:13.992
- avoiding me's the answer?
- Oh, for God's sake, I am not avoiding you.

10:14.027 --> 10:15.928
Marshall! (Thudding)

10:15.962 --> 10:17.429
Oh, my God, help! Oh, God, Marshall.

10:17.463 --> 10:20.198
Get a defibrillator!

10:20.232 --> 10:24.035
There's an emergency, Zalman
Plaza. Hurry, heart attack.

10:24.070 --> 10:26.171
(rhythmic breathing)

10:26.205 --> 10:28.139
COUNSELOR: <i>Whoa, whoa, whoa,
let me get this straight.</i>

10:28.174 --> 10:30.041
Your fight caused a heart attack?

10:36.042 --> 10:41.265
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

10:44.272 --> 10:45.673
Did the man die?

10:45.707 --> 10:47.575
No. No. And... and in all fairness,

10:47.609 --> 10:50.243
he was about to have a heart transplant.

10:50.278 --> 10:52.112
- And he was guilty.
- Guilty of what,

10:52.146 --> 10:53.480
- of wanting to live?
- Of breeching

10:53.514 --> 10:55.482
the donor registry. That's against the law.

10:55.516 --> 10:57.850
- Yeah, I know.
- That doesn't mean he was guilty

10:57.885 --> 10:59.619
of experimenting on...

10:59.653 --> 11:03.523
on... on things that he
shouldn't be experimenting on.

11:03.558 --> 11:04.791
We did not know that.

11:04.825 --> 11:06.659
Okay, uh, guys, look.

11:06.694 --> 11:08.928
A lot of issues coming up here,

11:08.963 --> 11:13.030
uh, avoidance and the
needing to save one another.

11:13.032 --> 11:15.331
It's great. It's great. It's
just that what we want to do

11:15.335 --> 11:17.002
is we want to try to untangle these issues

11:17.036 --> 11:18.770
so we can identify the real problem.

11:18.805 --> 11:20.072
For example, earlier, Vincent, you said

11:20.107 --> 11:21.974
that you thought that Cat resented you

11:22.008 --> 11:24.543
for always having to... save you.

11:24.578 --> 11:26.778
Wh... what did you mean by that?

11:26.813 --> 11:29.515
Uh...

11:29.549 --> 11:30.616
(growls)

11:30.650 --> 11:31.717
Let him go.

11:32.952 --> 11:34.452
Well, actually...

11:35.855 --> 11:37.089
(snarls) Vincent, wait!

11:37.123 --> 11:38.624
(growls)

11:38.658 --> 11:40.626
I, um...

11:40.660 --> 11:41.860
- Skip ahead.
- Skip ahead.

11:41.894 --> 11:43.561
O-kay.

11:43.596 --> 11:46.031
I'll just... I'll just skip... Uh, okay,

11:46.065 --> 11:49.234
what about you, Cat? When
Vincent suggested that these...

11:49.268 --> 11:53.070
cases, they were the only
thing keeping you together,

11:53.105 --> 11:54.905
- how did you feel about that?
- Actually, she suggested...

11:54.940 --> 11:56.374
I felt angry.

11:56.408 --> 11:58.143
And why did it make you feel angry?

11:58.177 --> 12:00.978
I don't know. It hurt.

12:01.013 --> 12:03.347
I don't want to have that be true.

12:03.381 --> 12:04.815
But it's not true.

12:04.850 --> 12:06.050
But you think it is.

12:08.787 --> 12:10.888
No. It's just that I feel that we spend

12:10.922 --> 12:12.890
all of our time on cases now.

12:12.924 --> 12:15.693
- That's all.
- Well, we don't really have much of a choice.

12:15.727 --> 12:16.694
How come?

12:16.728 --> 12:18.362
Well, it's...

12:18.396 --> 12:19.696
it's complicated,

12:19.730 --> 12:21.831
actually. But...

12:22.967 --> 12:24.734
the bottom line is that...

12:24.769 --> 12:26.836
we're better together.

12:26.871 --> 12:28.672
That's true.

12:28.706 --> 12:32.376
- We are.
- So you... you both feel that way?

12:32.410 --> 12:35.312
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

12:35.346 --> 12:37.380
Interesting.

12:38.849 --> 12:40.349
Is... is this a...

12:40.384 --> 12:41.785
I get the feeling that we're talking

12:41.819 --> 12:44.220
about the symptoms and
not the larger problem.

12:44.254 --> 12:47.857
So maybe if we could see

12:47.892 --> 12:49.759
why you weren't working so well together

12:49.794 --> 12:51.828
on this particular case...

12:51.862 --> 12:54.063
- MAN: Coming through. Coming through.
- All right, he's stable,

12:54.097 --> 12:56.799
- but I don't know for how long. Is the donor prepped?
- In OR 4

12:56.833 --> 12:59.001
- with the transplant team.
- Good. Cardio en route?

12:59.035 --> 13:01.870
- Inbound in 20.
- All right, get Mr. Zalman prepped right away, please.

13:01.905 --> 13:03.372
Come on. He'd better survive this.

13:03.407 --> 13:05.708
- I'm sorry?
- What that detective did

13:05.742 --> 13:08.043
- to Marshall was unforgivable.
- I know,

13:08.078 --> 13:09.644
Mrs. Zalman, but with all due respect,

13:09.679 --> 13:11.246
your husband did admit

13:11.280 --> 13:12.514
to breaking the law. The detective

13:12.548 --> 13:13.515
was simply doing her job.

13:13.549 --> 13:17.119
But doing her job may cost
him his life, Dr. Keller.

13:17.153 --> 13:18.821
What about that? Just...

13:18.855 --> 13:21.090
keep her away from him,
do you understand me?

13:21.124 --> 13:24.760
I didn't sacrifice my whole
life for him to lose him now.

13:24.794 --> 13:27.995
He'd better survive.

13:28.030 --> 13:29.598
If he doesn't, I will sue

13:29.632 --> 13:31.466
the NYPD and this hospital

13:31.500 --> 13:34.035
for everything that they're worth.

13:38.974 --> 13:40.908
For the record, I was right
about Zalman knowing the donor.

13:40.943 --> 13:44.078
Yeah, that just means he's some
rich guy trying to cut corners

13:44.113 --> 13:46.080
to save his own life, not the
guy behind the experiments.

13:46.115 --> 13:48.682
Really? Because I just spoke to
the donor's sister, who told me

13:48.717 --> 13:50.618
that April, that's the
donor, was actually sickly

13:50.652 --> 13:52.086
most of her life.

13:52.121 --> 13:54.956
Oh, really? Because you told me
she was training for a marathon.

13:54.990 --> 13:57.024
Exactly. But that was after she underwent

13:57.059 --> 14:00.594
experimental treatments that
supercharged her immune system.

14:00.629 --> 14:01.928
- Sound familiar?
- Okay, first of all,

14:01.963 --> 14:03.797
that could be a legitimate
clinical experiment.

14:03.831 --> 14:05.999
And, second, even if
they were serum-enhanced,

14:06.033 --> 14:08.835
Zalman could've never found that
information off the donor registry.

14:08.870 --> 14:10.837
Unless he's the one behind the experiments

14:10.872 --> 14:12.473
and he knew that April was a match,

14:12.507 --> 14:14.642
so he experimented on her

14:14.676 --> 14:16.542
- to make her healthy for him.
- Stop. Stop.

14:16.577 --> 14:18.444
Are you even listening
to yourself right now?

14:18.479 --> 14:20.546
Yes. And to me, I sound
like I'm making sense.

14:20.581 --> 14:22.849
No, you sound like you're
doing anything and everything

14:22.884 --> 14:25.451
to manufacture a case that doesn't exist.

14:25.486 --> 14:29.389
- Vincent, why would I do that?
- I... I don't know, but the last time we rushed into things,

14:29.423 --> 14:31.491
we almost got blown up,
along with my houseboat.

14:31.525 --> 14:33.526
You know, I really thought
we had learned our lesson.

14:33.560 --> 14:35.895
How can we learn our lesson
if we don't even have time

14:35.929 --> 14:37.463
to talk to each other?

14:37.498 --> 14:38.931
Is that why you're doing this?

14:38.965 --> 14:41.834
- So we can find time to talk to each other?
- No.

14:41.868 --> 14:44.404
I am doing this because
I think he's the bad guy.

14:44.438 --> 14:47.707
And if JT finds out that
April's blood is serum-enhanced

14:47.741 --> 14:49.741
just like the rest of the experiments,

14:49.776 --> 14:52.711
then I am one step closer to proving that.

14:52.745 --> 14:54.646
Why are you fighting me on this?

14:54.681 --> 14:56.615
Because I don't believe it.

14:58.718 --> 15:00.853
(sighs) Look, ever since we got engaged,

15:00.887 --> 15:02.554
all you want to do

15:02.588 --> 15:06.825
is throw yourself into
case after case after case.

15:06.859 --> 15:11.330
Okay. Obviously we are avoiding
dealing with our issues here.

15:11.364 --> 15:14.499
But if I'm right about Zalman,

15:14.534 --> 15:17.235
then there is no way he's
getting April's heart.

15:19.071 --> 15:22.240
(sighs)

15:22.274 --> 15:24.242
- (steady beeping)
- Need another retractor.

15:24.276 --> 15:26.444

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:35.387 --> 15:37.722
Four hours. That's it.

15:41.326 --> 15:42.526
Time of death,

15:42.561 --> 15:44.762
3:22 p.m.

15:44.796 --> 15:48.131
JT: <i>I'm telling you, this
whole thing doesn't make sense.</i>

15:48.166 --> 15:51.569
I mean, you saw me, Heather.
I broke my femur, my fibula,

15:51.603 --> 15:54.204
but they healed before you
even got me to the hospital.

15:54.239 --> 15:56.373
I'm, like, invincible.

15:56.407 --> 15:58.775
But it also scares the hell
out of me because I don't want

15:58.809 --> 16:01.311
to turn into one of
those superhuman freaks.

16:01.346 --> 16:04.982
No, I don't want to
bother Tess. She's crazed.

16:05.016 --> 16:07.650
I... I'm just hoping the
antidote I came up with works.

16:07.685 --> 16:09.786
(phone ringing)

16:09.820 --> 16:12.822
I got to go. Um, I'll call you back.

16:15.393 --> 16:17.159
Hello?

16:17.194 --> 16:19.095
JT, hey. Catherine's gonna
send you a blood sample,

16:19.129 --> 16:21.398
and she's gonna want to
know if it's enhanced.

16:21.432 --> 16:24.333
- But I need you to slow-walk it for me, will you?
- What? Why?

16:24.368 --> 16:26.669
Just trust me. I'm trying
to save a man's life here

16:26.704 --> 16:28.670
- and save Catherine from herself.
- (Phone rings)

16:28.705 --> 16:32.074
Uh, wait. Hold on. I
got another call. Hello.

16:32.109 --> 16:33.943
JT, I'm sending you a blood
sample. How soon can you find out

16:33.977 --> 16:36.012
- if it's enhanced?
- Um...

16:36.046 --> 16:38.314
- Enhanced? What do you mean enhanced?
- You know what I mean.

16:38.348 --> 16:41.984
I don't have a lot of time. Well,
maybe you and Vincent should talk first,

16:42.019 --> 16:43.752
- you know?
- Vincent?

16:43.787 --> 16:45.153
<i>Wait, did he call you about this?</i>

16:45.187 --> 16:46.455
Did he tell you not to help me?

16:46.489 --> 16:48.857
(phone rings) Uh...

16:48.892 --> 16:51.427
Hold, please. Hello.

16:51.461 --> 16:53.662
Have you talked to Cat?
She's not answering her phone,

16:53.696 --> 16:55.330
and Belinda Zalman's threatening to sue.

16:55.364 --> 16:56.532
She's on the other line, actually.

16:56.566 --> 16:58.033
Put her on. I want to talk to her now.

16:58.067 --> 16:59.835
(sighs) Hold on.

16:59.869 --> 17:01.136
Tess needs to talk to you.

17:01.170 --> 17:03.005
I don't have time to talk to Tess.

17:03.039 --> 17:05.306
- You're not Cat.
- Cat? What, is she on the other line?

17:05.340 --> 17:06.974
Put her on, man, 'cause I
need to talk to her right now.

17:07.010 --> 17:10.310
Hold on. Both Vincent and
Tess need to talk to you.

17:10.346 --> 17:12.079
- I am Tess.
- Sorry! Hold.

17:12.115 --> 17:13.848
Vincent and Tess need to talk to you.

17:13.883 --> 17:15.215
I don't want to talk to Vincent.

17:15.251 --> 17:16.916
I want to find out about the blood sample.

17:16.952 --> 17:19.020
- Cat doesn't want to talk to you.
- What?

17:19.054 --> 17:20.655
- You're not Vincent.
- Damn it. Get me Cat, all right?

17:20.689 --> 17:22.423
I knew this would bite me in the ass.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.291
Yeah, well, it would be nice
if someone cared about my ass

17:24.326 --> 17:26.727
once in a while. I got issues
I'm dealing with, too, okay?

17:26.762 --> 17:28.863
(sighs)

17:28.897 --> 17:30.064
- JT?
- JT?

17:30.098 --> 17:31.932
Oh!

17:31.967 --> 17:34.268
- What are you doing?
- Where are you going?

17:34.302 --> 17:36.037
Did you call JT? Did
you ask him to stall me?

17:36.071 --> 17:38.505
- Yes, I was just trying to save you.
- Save me?

17:38.540 --> 17:41.341
- I'm trying to solve all these cases to save you.
- Save me from what?

17:41.376 --> 17:44.679
From going primal, from
losing it, from losing you.

17:44.713 --> 17:46.580
I am trying to save us.

17:46.614 --> 17:49.716
- (alarm wailing)
- What's going on?

17:49.750 --> 17:51.785
I... I don't know. Hey, hey. What's going on?

17:51.819 --> 17:54.120
Something about a
transplant. A heart's missing.

17:54.155 --> 17:56.156
Great.

18:06.388 --> 18:09.519
You know, I've been doing
this for a long time,

18:09.557 --> 18:13.326
marriage counseling. And, uh...

18:13.361 --> 18:16.963
Hmm. Mmm. I got to say,

18:16.997 --> 18:19.298
this whole thing is very...

18:19.733 --> 18:22.301
unique.

18:22.335 --> 18:24.570
More to the point, I mean,
it's brought up a lot of,

18:24.604 --> 18:27.172
uh, premarital concerns. It's a good thing.

18:27.206 --> 18:29.275
It's just, like I said
before, we got to untangle them

18:29.309 --> 18:31.543
to find the real underlying issue.

18:31.977 --> 18:34.146
Okay. What is it?

18:38.050 --> 18:39.751
Uh, I think I need a
little bit more information.

18:39.786 --> 18:43.621
But this, uh, curious
attachment you both have

18:43.656 --> 18:46.825
to these kinds of... cases,

18:46.859 --> 18:49.961
as well as your obvious resentment

18:49.996 --> 18:51.763
for feeling like you have to

18:51.797 --> 18:53.464
"save each other all the time..."

18:53.499 --> 18:54.465
No, that's not true.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.834
I think that's true.

18:56.868 --> 18:58.569
Hmm.

18:58.604 --> 19:01.238
Your lives are unusually intertwined,

19:01.273 --> 19:02.172
is that fair to say?

19:02.173 --> 19:03.373
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

19:03.442 --> 19:04.909
Has it always been that way?

19:07.813 --> 19:09.379
Vincent!

19:24.662 --> 19:26.863
You really do love each other, don't you?

19:26.897 --> 19:28.365
More than anything.

19:28.399 --> 19:30.701
Then why don't we find out
what really caused this fight?

19:34.339 --> 19:37.507
(indistinct chatter)

19:37.542 --> 19:39.275
I told you there was something
special about April's heart.

19:39.310 --> 19:42.178
- Why else would someone want to steal it?
- Okay, why would Zalman steal it,

19:42.213 --> 19:43.822
have it go missing if
he needs it right now?

19:43.823 --> 19:44.823
They're prepped and ready for surgery.

19:44.982 --> 19:46.916
Okay, I don't have an answer
for that, but the fact is,

19:46.951 --> 19:48.918
somebody wants it,
whether it's Zalman or not.

19:48.953 --> 19:50.920
Anyone who needed it
could've taken it, okay?

19:50.955 --> 19:52.956
- It's... it's a rare blood type.
- Doesn't mean that it's not serum-enhanced.

19:52.990 --> 19:55.959
And it doesn't mean it's not black market
either. I mean, organ waiting lists are so long.

19:55.993 --> 19:59.328
- These things go for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
- But every instinct in my body

19:59.363 --> 20:01.697
says this is somehow connected
to superhuman experiments.

20:01.732 --> 20:04.266
Every instinct in my body says
this is a wild goose chase.

20:04.300 --> 20:05.401
Either way, we have to find that heart.

20:05.435 --> 20:06.702
Yeah, to save Zalman's life.

20:06.737 --> 20:07.903
To find out who's behind all this.

20:07.937 --> 20:09.538
- In less than four hours.
- All right.

20:09.573 --> 20:10.573
Then let's go our separate ways.

20:10.607 --> 20:12.641
- Fine.
- Fine.

20:13.076 --> 20:16.678
(woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.)

20:16.712 --> 20:18.413
Dr. Keller.

20:18.447 --> 20:20.448
What's going on?

20:20.483 --> 20:22.484
Why hasn't my husband's surgery started?

20:22.518 --> 20:25.086
Is this because of that detective somehow?

20:25.120 --> 20:27.955
No. No, it's... it's because the...

20:27.990 --> 20:29.391
the heart is still in transit.

20:29.425 --> 20:32.326
But I thought it was already here.

20:32.360 --> 20:33.727
No.

20:33.762 --> 20:36.730
No, but it... it will be, okay? I promise.

20:36.765 --> 20:39.834
- I'm sorry. Excuse me.
- I don't know what I would do

20:39.868 --> 20:42.136
if I lost him.

20:42.171 --> 20:44.471
You know?

20:44.506 --> 20:46.640
We've been together for over 20 years.

20:46.675 --> 20:50.477
I watched him build his
company up from scratch,

20:50.512 --> 20:54.748
and... now he's willing to give
it all away to that foundation.

20:56.651 --> 20:58.819
We're inseparable.

20:58.853 --> 21:02.255
TESS: <i>What do you mean,
you and Vincent separated?</i>

21:02.290 --> 21:03.690
Since when don't you two work together?

21:03.724 --> 21:05.325
Are you guys fighting?

21:05.359 --> 21:07.127
Weren't you talking about
seeing a marriage counselor?

21:07.161 --> 21:08.295
(engine revving, horns honking)

21:08.329 --> 21:11.064
Right now, I'm more worried
about April's heart than mine.

21:11.199 --> 21:13.300
Did you get a plate from the
hospital's surveillance camera?

21:13.334 --> 21:15.468
Yes, okay, the getaway car

21:15.502 --> 21:18.338
is a rental near 102 and Lex.
I called. It was just returned.

21:18.372 --> 21:20.306
- Okay, I'm on my way.
- TESS: Do you want me to send backup?

21:20.341 --> 21:23.209
Not unless you want this case
to really bite you in the ass.

21:23.243 --> 21:25.244
<i>Tess, I am convinced
this heart is enhanced.</i>

21:25.278 --> 21:27.146
Well, has JT confirmed that yet?

21:27.180 --> 21:29.349
I thought you were gonna call him?

21:29.383 --> 21:31.751
I've tried. He's not answering my calls.

21:31.785 --> 21:33.118
<i>I think he's mad at me.</i>

21:33.153 --> 21:34.320
Actually, no.

21:34.355 --> 21:35.822
- I <i>know</i> he's mad at me.
- (Knocking)

21:39.326 --> 21:41.560
But I will be mad at you if
you do not find that heart

21:41.594 --> 21:43.896
<i>before this case bites us
both in the ass, got it?</i>

21:43.930 --> 21:46.065
- Copy that.
- (Engine revving)

22:01.180 --> 22:03.314
(glass breaking)

22:07.987 --> 22:11.089
(glass clinking)

22:11.123 --> 22:15.326
(metallic thudding)

22:16.762 --> 22:18.963
Freeze, scum. Hands in the air!

22:21.033 --> 22:23.902
Scum? Really?

22:23.936 --> 22:25.436
Maybe we do need counseling.

22:25.470 --> 22:27.204
What are you doing here?

22:27.238 --> 22:28.338
The same thing you're doing here...

22:28.373 --> 22:29.907
looking for one missing heart.

22:29.941 --> 22:31.108
And you tracked it here?

22:31.142 --> 22:32.710
Well, I'm trying to,

22:32.744 --> 22:35.145
but the closer I seem to get,
the weaker the scent becomes.

22:35.179 --> 22:37.147
It's like... I don't know...

22:37.181 --> 22:38.449
like there's blood all over the place.

22:38.483 --> 22:40.083
And you're sure that you tracked it here?

22:40.118 --> 22:42.119
No, I'm not. Like I said, I'm trying to,

22:42.153 --> 22:43.853
but it's like there's blood...

22:47.425 --> 22:48.825
everywhere.

22:59.503 --> 23:01.471
Ten bucks says that's the thief.

23:01.505 --> 23:03.540
Wait. So somebody

23:03.574 --> 23:05.942
killed the thief and then
stole the heart from him?

23:05.976 --> 23:08.077
What the hell is going on with this case?

23:08.111 --> 23:09.312
I don't know. Good question.

23:09.346 --> 23:11.216
But we have got

23:11.248 --> 23:13.616
less than two hours to figure it out.

23:13.651 --> 23:16.052
Which means we got to
stop avoiding each other

23:16.086 --> 23:19.521
and start working together
before Zalman dies.

23:22.125 --> 23:24.226
All right, I'll keep you posted.

23:24.261 --> 23:26.362
Tess is sending Forensics.

23:26.396 --> 23:28.230
Any sign of the cooler?

23:28.265 --> 23:31.067
No. I don't think the thief
would have brought it here.

23:31.101 --> 23:32.835
Otherwise, I wouldn't have lost the scent.

23:32.869 --> 23:35.938
He probably stashed it nearby
until he was sure he got paid.

23:35.972 --> 23:37.973
Why would somebody hire
a thief to steal the heart

23:38.007 --> 23:39.975
and then kill him before
actually getting it?

23:40.009 --> 23:41.076
All I know right now is that

23:41.110 --> 23:42.644
that heart is out there somewhere.

23:42.679 --> 23:44.179
We got to find it fast
if we hope to save Zalman.

23:44.213 --> 23:46.114
Or he may end up with a supercharged heart.

23:46.148 --> 23:47.916
Or die waiting for it.

23:47.951 --> 23:50.218
- I'm gonna go see if I can pick up the scent.
- Okay.

23:51.787 --> 23:53.321
JT,

23:53.356 --> 23:55.256
<i>any news on the donor's blood sample?</i>

23:55.291 --> 23:58.226
Listen, I don't want to get in
the middle of something here,

23:58.260 --> 24:00.628
so unless you and Vincent can agree...

24:00.662 --> 24:02.597
It's okay. We're working together now.

24:02.631 --> 24:06.200
You are? See, and you didn't
even need a marriage counselor.

24:06.234 --> 24:08.002
JT, the sample.

24:08.036 --> 24:10.638
Right, and, well, you were right.

24:10.672 --> 24:12.206
<i>The... the donor was definitely enhanced.</i>

24:12.240 --> 24:15.242
<i>Same charged leukocytes as in...</i>

24:15.276 --> 24:18.178
my blood.

24:18.213 --> 24:20.681
Are you okay?

24:20.716 --> 24:24.818
Yeah, but she's not.

24:24.852 --> 24:27.721
I mean, I know she's dead, so
not <i>her</i> her, but her heart.

24:27.755 --> 24:29.289
<i>What about it?</i>

24:29.324 --> 24:31.025
Well, whoever did this probably wanted

24:31.059 --> 24:33.127
to see how powerful the serum really is,

24:33.161 --> 24:35.695
see if it could supercharge
even a sickly person.

24:35.730 --> 24:38.197
<i>But maybe it supercharged
her heart too much,</i>

24:38.232 --> 24:39.833
<i>overloaded her system.</i>

24:39.867 --> 24:41.568
Probably made her head feel like

24:41.602 --> 24:43.069
it was gonna explode, made her go crazy.

24:43.103 --> 24:44.638
And she tried to relieve the pressure

24:44.672 --> 24:46.840
by drilling a hole in her head.

24:46.874 --> 24:48.708
Which means you were
right, it wasn't suicide.

24:48.743 --> 24:50.977
Whoever is behind these experiments

24:51.012 --> 24:52.679
<i>drove her to it.</i>

24:52.713 --> 24:54.213
Okay, but even if we can
find the heart in time,

24:54.248 --> 24:55.381
the same thing's gonna happen to Zalman.

24:55.416 --> 24:57.116
Unless my antidote works.

24:57.151 --> 24:59.419
<i>Antidote?</i>

24:59.453 --> 25:01.054
How do you have an antidote?

25:01.088 --> 25:03.656
Well, I've been working on one for me.

25:03.690 --> 25:06.559
<i>I mean, cool as it is
to have a superpower,</i>

25:06.593 --> 25:10.263
I really don't want to end
up like all the other victims.

25:10.297 --> 25:13.999
I didn't realize that you
were worried about this.

25:14.034 --> 25:16.535
It's okay. I'm not... much.

25:16.570 --> 25:17.970
And I don't even know
if the antidote works,

25:18.004 --> 25:19.538
so the sooner you get me the heart,

25:19.573 --> 25:21.073
the sooner I can try it out.

25:21.107 --> 25:23.175
<i>Maybe normalize it before the transplant.</i>

25:23.209 --> 25:25.044
If we find it.

25:25.078 --> 25:27.546
- Catherine!
- Okay, I got to go. I'll call you back.

25:29.382 --> 25:31.950
A meat packing plant?

25:31.984 --> 25:33.918
Yeah.

25:33.953 --> 25:35.920
Like I said, blood everywhere.

25:35.955 --> 25:37.855
No wonder I couldn't pick up the scent.

25:37.890 --> 25:39.891
It's very confusing.

25:47.165 --> 25:49.067
The freezer.

25:53.138 --> 25:55.239
(door squeaks open)

25:56.475 --> 25:58.242
Oh.

25:58.276 --> 26:00.144
(sighs)

26:00.178 --> 26:02.079
Ah. Got it!

26:02.114 --> 26:03.880
Okay, come on, let's go.

26:06.851 --> 26:09.286
Aah!

26:09.321 --> 26:11.122
COUNSELOR: <i>It's amazing.</i>

26:11.156 --> 26:12.723
No matter how hard

26:12.757 --> 26:14.725
you both try to separate from each other,

26:14.759 --> 26:16.393
you seem to be drawn back together,

26:16.428 --> 26:18.428
whether you like it or not.

26:26.754 --> 26:29.355
You know what codependency is?

26:29.390 --> 26:30.891
- Code... codependency?
- Yeah, it's, uh...

26:30.925 --> 26:32.426
You lose yourself in the relationship.

26:32.460 --> 26:34.227
Your separate selves, yes.

26:34.261 --> 26:37.230
Often times to a unhealthy degree.

26:37.264 --> 26:40.099
Uh, you don't think
that's us, though, is it?

26:40.134 --> 26:43.736
Well, I mean, no, not in
the classic sense when people

26:43.770 --> 26:45.371
define their entire existence

26:45.406 --> 26:47.106
by their partners in an unhealthy way.

26:47.141 --> 26:49.008
But there are certain aspects

26:49.043 --> 26:50.609
of codependency in your relationship.

26:50.644 --> 26:52.645
I think, frankly,

26:52.679 --> 26:55.280
that's what the underlying issue is here.

26:55.315 --> 26:57.650
And it is what caused this fight.

26:57.684 --> 27:01.587
Hey, no, no, it's a good thing.

27:01.621 --> 27:03.121
It means that you're
chafing at the codependency.

27:03.156 --> 27:04.657
You don't like it.

27:04.691 --> 27:05.791
That's what finally brought you here.

27:05.826 --> 27:08.160
And it manifested itself in the case?

27:08.194 --> 27:11.563
Exactly.

27:11.597 --> 27:14.632
Look, you both obviously have

27:14.667 --> 27:17.769
a special love.

27:17.803 --> 27:19.403
You just got to be careful

27:19.438 --> 27:21.439
not to lose your separate
selves along the way.

27:21.474 --> 27:25.176
Even though, as you say,
and as you've clearly shown,

27:25.210 --> 27:27.712
you're better together.

27:27.746 --> 27:30.414
(rattling door)

27:30.449 --> 27:31.849
Oh!

27:31.883 --> 27:33.451
Yeah, it's locked.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.419
- So? Beast out!
- Beast out?

27:35.454 --> 27:37.955
- Have you seen how thick that door is?
- Well, we have got

27:37.990 --> 27:39.756
- to get out of here somehow, don't we?
- Okay, all right. Let's not

27:39.791 --> 27:42.159
fight about it. I know how badly
you want to solve this case.

27:42.194 --> 27:43.627
Who cares about the case?

27:43.661 --> 27:44.928
I don't want to freeze to death in here.

27:44.963 --> 27:47.298
Okay, all right, settle down.

27:47.332 --> 27:49.633
Okay.

27:49.667 --> 27:51.969
(inhales and exhales deeply)

27:54.799 --> 27:56.433
Vincent?

27:56.467 --> 27:58.501
I told you it's thick.

27:58.536 --> 28:02.539
Okay, I don't want to put
any pressure you or anything,

28:02.574 --> 28:04.874
but now would be a really
good time to go full beast.

28:04.908 --> 28:06.376
- Full beast?
- Yes.

28:06.410 --> 28:08.578
Really? So, all the times you've told me

28:08.612 --> 28:11.181
how tired you are of talking
me down from going primal?

28:11.215 --> 28:15.118
Vincent, now is not the time
to worry about my feelings,

28:15.152 --> 28:17.187
but thank you for caring.

28:17.221 --> 28:19.021
I do appreciate it.

28:19.056 --> 28:20.256
I do love you.

28:20.291 --> 28:22.725
I love you, too, Vincent.

28:22.759 --> 28:25.027
Now blast the freaking
door down, will you?!

28:25.062 --> 28:28.163
(growling)

28:35.906 --> 28:38.107
See how well we work together?

28:38.141 --> 28:40.375
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

28:42.479 --> 28:44.279
(indistinct voice over P.A.)

28:44.287 --> 28:46.922
Okay, really running out of time.

28:46.957 --> 28:48.791
- Please stop reminding me.
- Okay.

28:48.825 --> 28:51.560
CATHERINE: What if the antidote
doesn't work? We can't give Zalman

28:51.594 --> 28:54.596
- a supercharged heart, can we?
- VINCENT: We can't just let him die, either.

28:54.631 --> 28:57.232
- Can we?
- He's gonna die either way.

28:57.267 --> 29:00.369
Well, at least, this way buys us
time to try and save him. Okay.

29:00.403 --> 29:03.639
We don't have to worry about
that. The antidote worked.

29:03.673 --> 29:05.540
- The heart's not enhanced anymore. It's normal.
- You're sure?

29:05.575 --> 29:07.309
- Positive.
- Okay.

29:09.479 --> 29:10.645
Thanks.

29:10.679 --> 29:12.781
(door closes)

29:12.815 --> 29:15.316
Bodes well for me and
all the other victims.

29:15.350 --> 29:18.452
So good, JT. I got to go.

29:18.487 --> 29:20.088
(door opens)

29:20.122 --> 29:22.757
(indistinct voice over P.A.)

29:22.792 --> 29:25.260
- Go! Go!
- (Elevator bell dings)

29:25.294 --> 29:27.828
Is that it? Is it still good?

29:27.862 --> 29:29.963
Yeah, they're preparing your
husband for surgery as we speak.

29:29.998 --> 29:32.667
- Oh, thank God.
- MAN (over P.A.): Dr. Albrecht to the ER.

29:32.701 --> 29:34.935
What's she doing here?

29:34.969 --> 29:38.138
Actually, Catherine recovered
the heart, Mrs. Zalman.

29:38.173 --> 29:39.807
She may have just saved
your husband's life.

29:39.841 --> 29:42.643
Why the turnaround, Detective?

29:42.678 --> 29:44.178
I thought you thought

29:44.212 --> 29:45.645
my husband was the bad guy or something.

29:45.680 --> 29:47.480
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

29:47.515 --> 29:50.517
There's somebody out there
doing really bad things

29:50.551 --> 29:53.787
to people, Mrs. Zalman,
and I was trying to stop it.

29:56.958 --> 30:00.694
I've been a little obsessed with
this case for personal reasons.

30:00.728 --> 30:02.495
I'm working on it.

30:02.530 --> 30:06.132
Well, let's just hope,

30:06.166 --> 30:09.869
for all our sakes, that Marshall survives.

30:09.903 --> 30:12.071
- (elevator bell dings)
- Excuse me.

30:12.105 --> 30:16.008
Ouch. Guess we got a few things

30:16.043 --> 30:18.510
right and wrong about the case, huh?

30:18.545 --> 30:20.713
I know. Brought up a few issues, didn't it?

30:20.747 --> 30:23.482
Yeah, about how you keep
obsessing over the cases?

30:23.516 --> 30:24.683
And how you avoid them.

30:24.718 --> 30:26.052
- What?
- Yes.

30:26.086 --> 30:29.121
Okay. Maybe marriage counseling
isn't such a bad idea.

30:31.725 --> 30:35.927
MAN (over P.A.): Dr. Hebel, you're
needed at the nurses' station.

30:35.962 --> 30:37.996
Dr. Hebel, please report
to the nurses' station.

30:40.299 --> 30:44.803
You were supposed to make sure
they didn't find the heart.

30:44.838 --> 30:48.106
And now we have to make sure
my husband doesn't get it.

31:02.736 --> 31:04.403
♪ Can you hear my heartbeat? ♪

31:04.437 --> 31:06.138
How do you feel?

31:06.173 --> 31:08.975
Good. You know, I think it's great

31:09.009 --> 31:12.511
- we finally went to marriage counseling, don't you?
- Absolutely.

31:12.545 --> 31:14.413
I mean, knowing that
we've been codependent,

31:14.447 --> 31:16.248
me always feeling the need to save you...

31:16.282 --> 31:18.684
Me not liking it because
it makes me feel vulnerable.

31:18.718 --> 31:22.320
Right? Yeah, knowing the problem
makes it feel easier to solve.

31:22.355 --> 31:25.090
- Totally agree.
- (Laughs) See? Better already.

31:25.124 --> 31:27.659
Yeah.

31:27.694 --> 31:31.263
- Uh, whoa... what is it?
- What? Nothing.

31:31.297 --> 31:32.764
Catherine, we just paid 150 bucks

31:32.798 --> 31:34.266
to learn to listen to
our separate feelings.

31:34.300 --> 31:36.368
- Please, what is it?
- Okay,

31:36.402 --> 31:37.835
okay, but... but don't be mad,

31:37.870 --> 31:39.304
Okay.

31:39.338 --> 31:40.705
There's just something about that case...

31:40.739 --> 31:42.507
- Here we go again.
- The whole

31:42.541 --> 31:44.709
stealing a heart but not really wanting it,

31:44.743 --> 31:46.377
I just can't wrap my brain around that.

31:46.412 --> 31:48.279
Oh, my God.

31:48.313 --> 31:49.714
All right, who are you calling?

31:49.748 --> 31:50.815
The counselor. I just have one question.

31:50.849 --> 31:52.383
- But we just left.
- <i>Hello?</i>

31:52.418 --> 31:54.719
Dr. Glenroy? It's, uh, it's Catherine. Cat.

31:54.753 --> 31:56.120
Hi. Is everything all right?

31:56.154 --> 31:58.723
Yeah, good, great, um,
about codependency...

31:58.757 --> 32:01.959
You said that people can...
can define their existence

32:01.993 --> 32:04.194
by their partner in unhealthy ways, right?

32:04.229 --> 32:08.399
- Uh, if not caught and corrected, yeah.
- Ever in destructive ways?

32:08.433 --> 32:10.401
- Mrs. Zalman?
- Yeah.

32:10.435 --> 32:12.569
She said she'd given up her
whole life for him. What if she

32:12.603 --> 32:14.805
<i>didn't like the fact that he
was giving everything they had</i>

32:14.839 --> 32:17.308
- to his foundation?
- <i>Well, in extreme situations,</i>

32:17.342 --> 32:19.042
when the spouse is unable to separate

32:19.076 --> 32:21.411
him or herself from the codependency

32:21.446 --> 32:24.448
<i>any other way, they have been known to...</i>

32:24.482 --> 32:25.816
Kill their spouses?

32:25.850 --> 32:27.818
In extreme situations, yeah.

32:27.852 --> 32:30.487
Okay, thanks, Doc, call you back.

32:30.521 --> 32:32.989
Well, I mean, if that's the
case, then she had the motive

32:33.023 --> 32:34.925
to steal the heart so he
couldn't have the surgery.

32:34.959 --> 32:37.260
Yeah, put an end to the
codependency and stay rich.

32:37.294 --> 32:40.096
It makes sense, although
if she is behind it all,

32:40.130 --> 32:41.864
then how do we know she's not still trying?

32:50.074 --> 32:52.040
Shut the whole damn
hospital down, I don't care.

32:52.075 --> 32:53.642
Just do it.

32:53.677 --> 32:55.945
He's probably halfway
through the surgery by now.

32:57.981 --> 32:59.348
(sighs) She's not here.

32:59.382 --> 33:00.950
That's odd, considering her husband's

33:00.984 --> 33:03.218
in the middle of transplant surgery.

33:03.252 --> 33:04.653
Operating rooms are over here.

33:04.688 --> 33:06.455
Backup generators, too.

33:09.092 --> 33:11.593
This is it.

33:11.692 --> 33:13.060
Hurry up.

33:14.228 --> 33:16.863
Make it look like a short.

33:16.897 --> 33:19.566
If this leads back to
me, it leads back to you.

33:21.335 --> 33:23.002
I don't know, she must have got nervous,

33:23.037 --> 33:25.638
knew we were onto her and bolted, right?

33:25.673 --> 33:28.841
Or, like you said, she's not giving up.

33:28.876 --> 33:30.977
The backup generators
should've kicked in by now.

33:31.011 --> 33:33.112
She must've gotten to those, too.

33:33.146 --> 33:36.049
This is bad. If they're in the
middle of Zalman's surgery...

33:36.083 --> 33:37.650
Can you help? I mean,
you've got beast vision

33:37.685 --> 33:40.386
- or something, right?
- Yeah, but I'm no surgeon,

33:40.420 --> 33:41.820
- Catherine.
- You're his only hope.

33:41.854 --> 33:44.256
- Where are the generators?
- Uh...

33:44.291 --> 33:46.392
East wing, basement.

33:46.426 --> 33:47.993
Catherine.

33:50.163 --> 33:51.730
Kick her ass.

33:53.900 --> 33:56.335
- Clean this up for me a bit, please.
- Where the hell's the backup?

33:56.369 --> 33:57.403
- Start cranking the bypass.
- On it.

33:57.437 --> 33:59.638
- Hey, what can I do?
- Who are you?

33:59.672 --> 34:01.239
I'm Dr. Keller, okay?

34:01.273 --> 34:02.708
I can see in the dark. I'm scotopic.

34:02.742 --> 34:04.242
Just please, let me help.

34:04.276 --> 34:07.545
You, you. Bag the patient,

34:07.580 --> 34:09.114
you finish the aorta.

34:09.148 --> 34:10.215
Okay, we're prepped.

34:10.248 --> 34:11.817
Suture.

34:13.920 --> 34:15.587
Ready sutures.

34:15.621 --> 34:17.155
Freeze. You're under arrest.

34:19.757 --> 34:22.627
Go, get out of here.

34:22.661 --> 34:24.629
(grunting)

34:30.402 --> 34:32.335
(deep breath)

34:34.205 --> 34:36.107
Okay, just tell me where you need me.

34:36.141 --> 34:37.407
Temperature's dropping, Doctor.

34:37.442 --> 34:39.777
- What's the BP?
- Hurry,

34:39.811 --> 34:41.578
- we're almost out of time.
- Stable.

34:45.183 --> 34:46.216
(grunting)

35:22.252 --> 35:24.353
We did it.

35:25.955 --> 35:28.324
And separately.

35:28.358 --> 35:30.693
And he said we're codependent.

35:42.023 --> 35:43.190
You got her.

35:43.224 --> 35:44.892
Oh, yeah. At JFK,

35:44.926 --> 35:46.193
about to get on a private jet to who

35:46.227 --> 35:47.661
- knows where.
- Nice work, Captain.

35:47.696 --> 35:49.129
Yeah. At least I don't have to worry

35:49.164 --> 35:50.330
about her suing the department now.

35:51.499 --> 35:53.166
How's her husband?

35:53.201 --> 35:54.801
He's gonna pull through.

35:54.835 --> 35:57.737
Without becoming a superhuman monster.

35:57.771 --> 35:59.706
Great. It all worked out.

35:59.740 --> 36:02.809
I am sensing passive-aggressive.

36:02.843 --> 36:05.679
I'm sensing someone who's been in therapy.

36:07.448 --> 36:11.184
Look, Cat, we can't keep
doing this, all right?

36:11.218 --> 36:12.919
I'm not your partner
anymore, I'm your captain...

36:12.953 --> 36:16.723
- I know.
- Do you? Because I can't keep covering for you.

36:16.757 --> 36:18.290
And it's not that I don't want to,

36:18.325 --> 36:20.827
you know that I do.

36:20.861 --> 36:22.962
But this kind of stuff? I mean, come on.

36:22.996 --> 36:25.097
It's what cost Joe his
job a couple years ago,

36:25.131 --> 36:27.700
- and I don't want it to cost me mine.
- I understand.

36:27.734 --> 36:31.036
But what are we supposed to do?

36:31.070 --> 36:34.607
Because, unlike Joe, you do
know what's really going on.

36:34.641 --> 36:36.742
- We can't just ignore that.
- I know.

36:36.776 --> 36:39.311
It's a balancing act,
Cat, but that said, I...

36:39.346 --> 36:42.614
it's my life, too, okay?
And I don't want all this

36:42.648 --> 36:44.315
- beast stuff to...
- Bite you in the ass?

36:44.350 --> 36:46.584
- Exactly.
- Hmm.

36:46.619 --> 36:48.386
All right, I have to
get to an interrogation

36:48.420 --> 36:50.856
and bust a bad guy for attempted murder,

36:50.890 --> 36:53.191
- thanks to you.
- Doing my beast job.

36:53.226 --> 36:55.560
Okay, wait, wait.

36:55.594 --> 36:58.363
I know that you're
really swamped right now,

36:58.397 --> 37:00.265
but maybe you should talk to JT.

37:00.299 --> 37:03.534
I think that he's feeling...

37:03.569 --> 37:05.970
Let's just say that you don't want

37:06.004 --> 37:08.172
your life to be all
about your cases, either.

37:21.853 --> 37:24.755
I cannot believe it.

37:24.790 --> 37:28.058
I'm sorry, Mr. Zalman, I really am.

37:28.093 --> 37:30.727
I mean, I had no idea.

37:30.762 --> 37:34.665
I thought Belinda was happy, you know?

37:34.699 --> 37:37.167
We've been together 20 years.

37:37.201 --> 37:41.672
No idea she resented me like that.

37:41.706 --> 37:44.841
Well, I guess it could
happen to the best of us.

37:46.303 --> 37:48.471
Obviously...

37:48.505 --> 37:51.440
not to this extent, but...

37:53.410 --> 37:55.278
I guess if you don't catch
it early in a relationship...

38:00.617 --> 38:03.486
Look, uh, Mr. Zalman, for what it's worth,

38:03.520 --> 38:06.321
you helped me catch it early in mine.

38:09.158 --> 38:11.394
Well, if it makes you feel any better...

38:11.428 --> 38:13.996
you saved my life.

38:21.037 --> 38:23.338
(indistinct conversations)

38:29.011 --> 38:31.178
Hey.

38:31.747 --> 38:33.815
Hey.

38:34.883 --> 38:36.450
Mad at me?

38:36.485 --> 38:38.586
No.

38:38.620 --> 38:40.554
- Yes.
- Maybe.

38:40.589 --> 38:42.289
A little.

38:42.324 --> 38:44.125
JT, I'm sorry.

38:44.159 --> 38:47.060
I am, I'm sorry. I know that
you've been going through

38:47.095 --> 38:49.163
a lot of stuff, and I
know you're a little scared

38:49.197 --> 38:51.198
- about what's inside you.
- I'm not scared.

38:52.334 --> 38:55.068
Okay.

38:55.103 --> 38:58.304
All right, look, if you know me
so well, where've you been, huh?

38:58.339 --> 39:00.807
Yeah, I'm scared.

39:00.842 --> 39:02.242
And yes, I'm mad.

39:02.276 --> 39:04.244
Not at you, I'm just...

39:06.247 --> 39:07.480
Just what?

39:07.515 --> 39:08.849
I don't know, mad at the gods, I guess.

39:08.883 --> 39:10.983
For doing this to me.

39:11.018 --> 39:13.953
I mean, look, the serum saved my life,

39:13.987 --> 39:18.090
but now it's teasing me
with super cool powers and...

39:18.125 --> 39:19.925
God knows what it's gonna do to me next.

39:19.960 --> 39:21.093
But Cat said the antidote...

39:21.128 --> 39:22.529
It doesn't work on me.

39:22.563 --> 39:24.997
I tried it.

39:25.032 --> 39:27.099
Twice.

39:29.970 --> 39:32.672
Worked on the heart, but...

39:32.706 --> 39:34.640
maybe the serum's been in my body too long,

39:34.675 --> 39:37.977
fused with my cells or something.

39:38.011 --> 39:40.713
- Are you sure?
- What, you want me to fling myself down the stairs again

39:40.747 --> 39:42.715
- and prove it?
- Okay.

39:42.749 --> 39:44.083
Listen to me.

39:44.217 --> 39:46.352
You do not have to go through this alone,

39:46.386 --> 39:47.987
do you understand me?

39:48.021 --> 39:50.756
Now, I don't care how busy I
am, I don't care what I'm doing.

39:50.790 --> 39:52.691
This matters to me.

39:52.725 --> 39:54.093
You matter to me.

39:55.962 --> 39:57.029
Yeah?

39:57.764 --> 39:59.765
Yeah.

40:10.410 --> 40:12.577
(sirens wailing in distance)

40:19.018 --> 40:21.352
Are you awake?

40:21.387 --> 40:22.553
No.

40:22.587 --> 40:23.854
What?

40:23.889 --> 40:26.190
I think we should close the window.

40:26.225 --> 40:29.827
Why?

40:29.861 --> 40:31.262
Because we are no closer

40:31.297 --> 40:33.063
to figuring out who's behind
all this, which means Bob

40:33.097 --> 40:34.632
- and Carol are still out there.
- (Heavy sigh)

40:34.666 --> 40:36.366
- Bob and Carol?
- Yes.

40:36.401 --> 40:39.804
- Superhuman assassins.
- Yes.

40:42.974 --> 40:45.443
And you think closing the window is gonna

40:45.477 --> 40:49.313
stop them? Come on, I thought
we're not supposed to be

40:49.347 --> 40:52.983
- talking about cases for once, right?
- Give me a break, Vincent,

40:53.017 --> 40:54.451
our lives have been like this for over

40:54.485 --> 40:56.219
two years. It's gonna take
me some time to adjust.

40:56.254 --> 41:00.090
- Oh, yeah?
- (Short laugh) Yeah.

41:00.124 --> 41:02.092
Well, I think I've got just the thing.

41:02.126 --> 41:03.293
Do you?

41:03.328 --> 41:05.228
Mm-hmm.

41:10.468 --> 41:12.201
