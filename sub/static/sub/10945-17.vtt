00:01.178 --> 00:02.878
<i>That is Charger.</i>

00:02.945 --> 00:04.413
<i>It turns out</i>
<i>he's the real deal.</i>

00:04.447 --> 00:06.048
What, are you thinking
about buying him?

00:06.116 --> 00:10.719
What if you and I were
to go in on him together?

00:10.787 --> 00:13.255
We could split the costs and
the winnings, fifty-fifty.

00:13.323 --> 00:15.124
There's something that
I should've told you a while ago

00:15.192 --> 00:16.024
<i>about the diner.</i>

00:16.091 --> 00:17.458
What about it?

00:17.492 --> 00:18.853
Well, I pitched in some funds.

00:18.894 --> 00:21.896
Actually, I pitched in
a lot of funds.

00:21.931 --> 00:23.397
In a way, I think,

00:23.465 --> 00:25.466
I guess that makes me
your silent partner.

00:25.534 --> 00:26.434
Surprise!

00:26.501 --> 00:28.102
I'm in.

00:28.170 --> 00:29.871
Let's buy Charger.

00:29.939 --> 00:32.974
I can't believe I'm gonna
own a futurity contender.

00:33.008 --> 00:34.209
Here's to a big payday.

00:34.243 --> 00:35.443
I'll drink to that.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.074

00:50.859 --> 00:52.593
Amy Fleming to see prince Ahmed.
He's expecting me.

00:52.627 --> 00:53.827
Fine. Go ahead.

01:08.726 --> 01:10.927
Hey, Zeus. Hey.

01:10.961 --> 01:13.796
<i>Amy. Thank you for coming.</i>

01:13.831 --> 01:16.165
No problem.
It's good to see you.

01:16.199 --> 01:18.400
You look well.
How are you feeling?

01:18.435 --> 01:19.736
I'm a hundred percent.

01:19.770 --> 01:21.337
<i>Good.</i>

01:21.371 --> 01:24.240
I hope it's not too difficult
for you to be here.

01:24.307 --> 01:26.208
I can imagine there must be
some bad memories.

01:26.243 --> 01:27.776
<i>I'm okay.</i>

01:27.810 --> 01:30.479
I used to think about
the accident a lot,

01:30.514 --> 01:34.250
but now I'm just focusing on
moving forward with my life.

01:34.284 --> 01:35.684
Zeus looks great.

01:35.718 --> 01:37.686
How's he doing?

01:37.720 --> 01:39.921
Unfortunately, he's the same:

01:39.956 --> 01:41.256
Sensitive and unpredictable.

01:43.392 --> 01:46.027
But I still believe
he could be a champion one day.

01:46.061 --> 01:49.030
In fact, that's why I asked you
to come here.

01:49.064 --> 01:50.598
I'd like to make you an offer.

01:50.633 --> 01:52.098
What kind of offer?

01:53.469 --> 01:55.403
You said you wanted
to move forward with your life.

01:55.437 --> 01:56.971
Perhaps I can help you
with that.

02:07.716 --> 02:09.015
I just got the email!

02:09.084 --> 02:10.951
Charger is officially registered

02:10.985 --> 02:13.620
in the Hudson Pot of Gold
Racing Futurity.

02:13.655 --> 02:17.658
Right on, man! I can
already smell the money!

02:17.726 --> 02:19.794
Well, I'd feel a lot better
if the race wasn't next week.

02:19.828 --> 02:21.828
I mean, we don't even
have a rider.

02:21.896 --> 02:23.196
I've already set up a meeting

02:23.230 --> 02:25.031
with one of the best
barrel racers I know:

02:25.099 --> 02:27.366
Ms. Charlene Young.

02:27.401 --> 02:29.769
Man, wait until you see
how hot she is.

02:29.804 --> 02:30.636
I don't care
what she looks like Caleb,

02:30.705 --> 02:31.805
as long as she can ride!

02:31.839 --> 02:33.106
She can ride, trust me.

02:34.608 --> 02:36.042
Relax, buddy!

02:36.077 --> 02:37.977
I can't relax!

02:38.045 --> 02:39.079
I've sunk my entire life savings
into this horse!

02:39.146 --> 02:40.612
Yeah, so have I,

02:40.646 --> 02:42.047
but you don't see me
sweating it, do ya?

02:42.115 --> 02:44.016
Do you wanna know why?

02:44.084 --> 02:45.650
What we have here
is a surefire winner.

02:45.719 --> 02:47.485
And with Charlene on our team,

02:47.553 --> 02:48.634
we're gonna be unstoppable!

03:02.067 --> 03:03.835
I've been trying to find
a new trainer

03:03.869 --> 03:05.837
to work for me here in Hudson.

03:05.904 --> 03:08.139
But so far,

03:08.207 --> 03:10.274
none of the candidates
impress me much.

03:10.342 --> 03:11.943
They're either
too inexperienced

03:12.010 --> 03:15.213
or too traditional.

03:15.280 --> 03:20.084
But mostly the problem is...
They're not you.

03:20.152 --> 03:22.685
Amy, would you consider
coming back to Hillhurst?

03:22.720 --> 03:24.621
Only, this time
as my head trainer.

03:24.688 --> 03:25.622
Are you serious?

03:25.689 --> 03:27.057
Very.

03:27.125 --> 03:29.292
It's a full-time position.

03:29.360 --> 03:32.428
You'd have complete use
of the facilities and staff,

03:32.496 --> 03:35.065
and of course there would be
generous compensation

03:35.133 --> 03:36.599
for your services.

03:39.436 --> 03:42.305
I don't seem to win
unless you're around, Amy.

03:42.373 --> 03:44.875
You're my good luck charm!

03:44.909 --> 03:45.776
What do you say?

03:56.153 --> 03:58.387
<i>- Hey, hey! Welcome back!</i>
- Hey!

03:58.421 --> 04:00.022
Oh!

04:00.090 --> 04:01.023
It is so good to be back!

04:01.057 --> 04:02.992
Oh!

04:03.026 --> 04:04.927
Now, there are a few things
I should catch you up on first,

04:04.995 --> 04:06.727
but I'll let you
get settled in.

04:06.762 --> 04:08.663
- Sure, yeah.
- Is that the--

04:08.697 --> 04:10.431
"Mom's the word."

04:10.465 --> 04:11.632
Hopefully it'll sell
better here

04:11.667 --> 04:12.600
than it did on the book tour.

04:12.634 --> 04:15.303
Oh, it's beautiful!

04:15.337 --> 04:17.777
What is that? Hmm?

04:20.075 --> 04:22.476
Why is there a big
screen TV in my diner?

04:22.511 --> 04:23.211
What?

04:27.248 --> 04:29.683
Okay, I don't mind you
taking initiative--

04:29.717 --> 04:31.418
In fact, I encourage it,

04:31.452 --> 04:34.087
but you really should've
talked to me first.

04:34.122 --> 04:35.789
Lou, it wasn't my decision.

04:35.824 --> 04:36.924
Oh, then whose was it?!

04:36.958 --> 04:38.792
Your dad's.

04:38.827 --> 04:40.828
My dad's?!

04:40.862 --> 04:43.230
Yeah, I assumed that
he had your blessing.

04:43.264 --> 04:44.831
I mean, he is your
business partner, right?

04:44.865 --> 04:47.733
No, no, no!
Silent business partner!

04:47.767 --> 04:48.935
Emphasis on silent!

04:51.305 --> 04:52.604
Did she turn it off?
Is something wrong?

04:55.042 --> 04:56.008
Oh boy...

05:09.088 --> 05:10.322
Oh! Oh...

05:10.390 --> 05:12.157
Are you gonna cry?

05:12.191 --> 05:14.125
Loser!

05:14.160 --> 05:17.229
Hey! Remember what I did
to Olivia's face?

05:17.296 --> 05:20.098
I'll do the same to you
if you don't quit it!

05:20.132 --> 05:22.267
<i>What was that?</i>

05:22.301 --> 05:23.934
<i>Yeah, um... wow!</i>

05:26.872 --> 05:27.672
<i>Whoa!</i>

05:36.382 --> 05:37.749
That's her over there.

05:37.783 --> 05:39.083
Look, Charlene and I
go way back,

05:39.150 --> 05:40.618
so just let me do
the talking, okay?

05:40.686 --> 05:43.487
Charlene, wow.

05:43.521 --> 05:45.289
You're even better looking
than I remember.

05:45.357 --> 05:47.457
Flattery'll get you nowhere,
Caleb.

05:47.525 --> 05:49.960
- How long has it been?
- A long time.

05:50.028 --> 05:52.329
Your phone call
really came out of the blue.

05:52.364 --> 05:53.463
Actually, I was never
expecting to see

05:53.531 --> 05:55.099
your two-timing face again.

05:55.166 --> 05:56.033
Wait, what?

05:59.704 --> 06:01.038
<i>Do me a favour, Caleb.
Lose my number!</i>

06:05.976 --> 06:07.744
What happened?!

06:07.812 --> 06:10.453
I think this is gonna take a little
more convincing than I thought.

06:11.749 --> 06:13.817
Stay here. I'm gonna go
talk to Charlene.

06:17.321 --> 06:18.822
Friend of yours?

06:21.358 --> 06:23.793
Hey, Charlene!
Wait up a sec!

06:23.827 --> 06:25.694
I'm sort of making
an exit here!

06:25.762 --> 06:27.897
Can I just talk to you
for a minute, please?

06:27.965 --> 06:30.099
You're Caleb's friend?

06:30.167 --> 06:31.301
Yes, and I fully acknowledge
his ability

06:31.368 --> 06:33.036
to be a complete idiot.

06:33.103 --> 06:35.338
I guess that makes you
the smart one.

06:35.372 --> 06:36.239
So what're you doing
hanging around

06:36.307 --> 06:38.074
a rodeo junkie like Caleb?

06:38.108 --> 06:40.310
We're partners in a futurity
barrel racing horse.

06:40.377 --> 06:42.345
Obviously not smart enough.

06:42.413 --> 06:43.893
We want you to be our rider,
Charlene.

06:43.914 --> 06:45.080
I don't ride just any horse.

06:45.148 --> 06:46.749
Well, he's fast!

06:46.817 --> 06:48.317
I've heard that one before.

06:48.351 --> 06:49.284
Caleb thinks he's
a surefire winner.

06:49.352 --> 06:50.319
I bet he does!

06:52.322 --> 06:53.962
Grand prize is
a hundred thousand dollars.

06:57.026 --> 06:58.861
Okay, now you have
my attention.

07:18.013 --> 07:20.214
♪ And at the break of day

07:20.282 --> 07:24.918
♪ you sank into your dream.

07:24.987 --> 07:26.253

07:26.288 --> 07:28.990

07:29.024 --> 07:31.592

07:44.972 --> 07:46.892
Well, good luck at
the auction in Red Deer.

07:47.208 --> 07:49.810
Hey, don't buy too many horses.

07:52.213 --> 07:55.549
Lis, there's someone
at the door.

07:55.583 --> 07:58.151
Hey, how 'bout I call you back?

08:04.024 --> 08:05.457
Well, don't just stand there,

08:05.492 --> 08:07.793
I can't afford to heat
the entire province.

08:07.828 --> 08:10.129
Is Georgie home?

08:10.163 --> 08:13.132
No, she's not.
She's at trick-riding practice.

08:13.199 --> 08:16.235
Won't be home
for an hour or so.

08:16.269 --> 08:19.005
Could you give this to her
for me please, sir?

08:19.072 --> 08:20.172
Yeah.
You got a name?

08:20.206 --> 08:22.174
Stephen.

08:22.208 --> 08:24.328
Well, is there a message
I should pass along, Stephen?

08:26.679 --> 08:28.847
I gotta go!
Thank you, sir.

08:30.683 --> 08:33.052
You're welcome.

08:33.119 --> 08:33.919
Sir!

08:37.657 --> 08:39.724
Dad, I'm glad you're here.

08:39.792 --> 08:42.327
The TV has got to go!

08:42.361 --> 08:43.160
Lou...

08:44.963 --> 08:46.264
Calm down.

08:46.298 --> 08:48.499
Look, Maggie had TVs in here,

08:48.567 --> 08:51.202
but she took them down because
the customers complained.

08:51.236 --> 08:53.137
This is a family restaurant,
not a beer hall.

08:53.172 --> 08:54.705
- Yeah.
- So...

08:54.773 --> 08:57.975
You're right;
It is a family restaurant.

08:58.043 --> 08:59.943
It's a family restaurant
that people have always come to

09:00.010 --> 09:03.046
and enjoyed a piece of pie,
a cup of coffee,

09:03.114 --> 09:05.282
and then, they pay their bill.

09:05.349 --> 09:06.450
Yeah.

09:06.517 --> 09:08.585
And they rush home

09:08.652 --> 09:10.120
<i>to watch</i>
<i>"Hockey Night in Canada,"</i>

09:10.154 --> 09:11.621
but now,
they don't have to leave!

09:11.689 --> 09:13.823
They can stay
and they can eat more pie,

09:13.891 --> 09:15.892
and drink coffee,
and eat chicken wings.

09:15.960 --> 09:16.893
We don't have chicken wings!

09:16.961 --> 09:17.961
We should have chicken wings.

09:17.995 --> 09:19.563
Okay, look.

09:19.630 --> 09:21.464
I'm going for a certain
aesthetic here, Dad,

09:21.531 --> 09:24.000
and the TV works
totally against it.

09:24.068 --> 09:26.469
And I mean could the cash
machine be any uglier?!

09:26.536 --> 09:28.471
I knew you'd be resistant
to my ideas,

09:28.538 --> 09:30.039
but you just gotta give 'em
a chance, honey, that's all.

09:30.107 --> 09:31.540
Okay, Nicole?
Nicole,

09:31.609 --> 09:35.745
can you please talk
some sense into him?

09:35.813 --> 09:37.446
Well, you know,
playing the hockey game

09:37.514 --> 09:41.750
might actually...
Increase business.

09:41.818 --> 09:43.218
<i>You know,</i>
<i>especially in the evening.</i>

09:43.219 --> 09:45.186
<i>And the cash machine</i>
<i>is convenient for the customers</i>

09:45.254 --> 09:48.189
and we get a cut
of the service fee.

09:48.224 --> 09:52.494
But I... you know,
I could be completely wrong.

09:52.561 --> 09:55.263
Lou, change is always difficult,

09:55.331 --> 09:58.199
but it's time for this diner
to evolve.

09:58.267 --> 10:01.069
Give the people what they want!

10:01.104 --> 10:01.936
Excuse me, sir.

10:04.306 --> 10:06.307
That's what I always say.

10:06.375 --> 10:08.476
<i>And what do the people want?</i>

10:08.544 --> 10:12.147
The people want... hockey!

10:12.181 --> 10:14.682
Hockey! Yeah!

10:14.750 --> 10:15.816
<i>You're welcome.</i>

10:15.851 --> 10:16.784
<i>Thank you.</i>

10:19.388 --> 10:21.789
<i>And here's what he's offering:</i>

10:25.693 --> 10:26.726
That's a lot of zeros.

10:26.794 --> 10:28.094
I know.

10:28.129 --> 10:29.496
And Ty, if I take the job,

10:29.531 --> 10:31.531
we could finally put
the down payment on the ranch.

10:35.336 --> 10:37.737
Well, Amy, I just...

10:37.772 --> 10:41.775
Wanna say that I support
any decision you make,

10:41.809 --> 10:42.742
but don't just do this
for the down payment.

10:42.777 --> 10:45.912
Do it because you wanna do it.

10:45.946 --> 10:48.548
Well, Ty,
it's an amazing opportunity.

10:48.582 --> 10:52.451
It is, but...

10:52.486 --> 10:54.821
Let's say money
wasn't an issue.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.890
Would you still take the job?

10:56.924 --> 10:58.758
I don't know.

10:58.793 --> 11:00.660
I really think
that I could help Zeus.

11:00.695 --> 11:01.728
I do, and I could do it
my own way,

11:01.762 --> 11:03.063
without someone like Adrian

11:03.097 --> 11:05.098
breathing down my neck
all the time.

11:05.132 --> 11:06.866
But...

11:06.901 --> 11:09.569
It is a full-time job
away from Heartland

11:09.603 --> 11:11.504
and things are just starting
to pick up.

11:11.538 --> 11:14.874
The last thing I wanna do
is turn away clients!

11:14.909 --> 11:16.275
Why is this so hard?!

11:17.877 --> 11:20.312
Well, it's a big decision.

11:20.379 --> 11:23.215
You don't have to make it
right now.

11:23.249 --> 11:25.283
Sleep on it. You'll have a
clearer head in the morning.

11:25.351 --> 11:26.885
There's no way
I'm gonna be able to sleep.

11:26.920 --> 11:30.655
I can't stop thinking
about this, Ty!

11:30.690 --> 11:32.825
Well, maybe I can help you
with that.

11:37.430 --> 11:39.531
Mm...
I'm still thinking about it.

11:41.300 --> 11:43.167
How about now?

11:43.202 --> 11:46.037
What were we talking about?

11:46.071 --> 11:49.073
So since when did my dad
suddenly decide to get involved?

11:49.108 --> 11:50.141
Oh, I think you
ought to be careful

11:50.209 --> 11:51.776
how you handle this.

11:51.810 --> 11:53.510
Like it or not,

11:53.545 --> 11:56.047
your father has
a financial stake in that diner.

11:57.983 --> 12:00.618
You know what?
You're absolutely right!

12:00.652 --> 12:02.453
And that is why I should
give him just enough rope

12:02.520 --> 12:03.621
to hang himself with.

12:03.688 --> 12:06.157
Well, that's not what I meant!

12:06.225 --> 12:07.324
<i>No, no, no. If
he wants to come in</i>

12:07.392 --> 12:08.912
and make his little changes,
then fine.

12:08.926 --> 12:09.993
But when the regulars
start griping,

12:10.061 --> 12:12.363
and believe me they will,

12:12.430 --> 12:14.064
I'll send them right over
to my dad.

12:14.132 --> 12:17.434
<i>It's simple, clean, brilliant.</i>

12:20.272 --> 12:22.273
Hey.

12:22.340 --> 12:24.341
Almost forgot.

12:24.409 --> 12:27.678
A boy named Stephen
dropped something off for you.

12:29.113 --> 12:29.846
Who's Stephen?

12:32.783 --> 12:34.350
No one.
Just some kid from school.

12:36.287 --> 12:38.354
I gotta go get
the rest of the dishes.

12:48.265 --> 12:50.600
Thanks for coming, Charlene.

12:50.668 --> 12:52.835
Caleb and I are really excited
you agreed to do this.

12:52.903 --> 12:54.503
Oh, I haven't agreed
to anything yet.

12:54.537 --> 12:55.870
First, I want Caleb here

12:55.905 --> 12:59.508
to admit that
he's a two-timing jerk.

12:59.575 --> 13:01.777
I mean we weren't exactly
exclusive.

13:04.213 --> 13:06.214
But I can see how I maybe
gave you that impression.

13:08.584 --> 13:10.385
And?

13:12.887 --> 13:14.789
And I'm really sorry
if I did treat you badly.

13:17.659 --> 13:19.020
All right, let's do this.

13:23.965 --> 13:25.566
<i>Yaaah!</i>

13:28.036 --> 13:29.470
Whoa! What was that?!

13:41.982 --> 13:44.951
Okay, let's get you around
that first barrel.

13:50.990 --> 13:52.257
Whoa! Whoa!

13:59.866 --> 14:00.766
That's it!

14:09.342 --> 14:10.408
Yaaah!

14:11.978 --> 14:12.643
Come on!

14:21.687 --> 14:24.022
Whoa.

14:24.056 --> 14:25.790
Hey, you were great out there.

14:25.824 --> 14:27.959
Well, there's a few kinks
to work out.

14:27.994 --> 14:29.526
That was really fast
out of the gate.

14:29.560 --> 14:31.728
Yeah, too fast!

14:31.796 --> 14:32.796
He goes from zero to a hundred

14:32.830 --> 14:35.132
before he's even out the alley.

14:35.166 --> 14:36.566
Charger's got the speed, but...

14:36.601 --> 14:38.502
He's too eager.

14:38.536 --> 14:39.970
Well, just take him
for a few more runs,

14:40.005 --> 14:41.571
you'll be fine.

14:41.639 --> 14:43.274
Caleb, if I can't
control his speed,

14:43.308 --> 14:44.775
there's no way
I can make the first turn.

14:44.842 --> 14:46.543
So what do we do?

14:46.611 --> 14:48.178
If I had a few months,

14:48.246 --> 14:50.380
maybe I could get him
into shape.

14:50.448 --> 14:52.449
But a futurity race next week?

14:52.517 --> 14:55.184
In your dreams.

14:55.252 --> 14:58.288
Sorry, boys,
you bought yourselves a dud.

14:58.355 --> 14:59.322
I'm out.

15:08.996 --> 15:10.830
<i>Face it, Ty, we need Amy.</i>

15:10.898 --> 15:13.133
I don't want her involved.

15:13.200 --> 15:15.135
She's the only one that
can fix that horse in a week.

15:15.202 --> 15:17.871
Just leave her out of this,
okay?

15:17.938 --> 15:19.639
Is this some kind
of macho pride thing?

15:19.707 --> 15:21.941
'Cause if it is, you need to
suck it up and get over it.

15:23.377 --> 15:24.977
I haven't told Amy
about the race

15:25.045 --> 15:26.712
or Charger.

15:26.780 --> 15:28.781
Are you serious?!

15:28.848 --> 15:32.418
Drop it, Caleb, okay?

15:32.486 --> 15:34.353
I got a shift at the clinic.

15:34.421 --> 15:35.454
- I gotta go.
- Yeah.

15:45.264 --> 15:46.364
I haven't made up my
mind yet about your offer,

15:46.432 --> 15:48.000
if that's why you're here.

15:48.034 --> 15:49.434
I was hoping you had
an answer for me,

15:49.468 --> 15:52.304
but that's not the only reason
I came.

15:52.371 --> 15:54.740
Hello.

15:54.808 --> 15:55.708
I hope I'm not interrupting
anything.

15:55.775 --> 15:57.509
Not at all.

15:57.577 --> 16:00.512
Amy and I were just discussing
some business.

16:00.546 --> 16:02.781
Ahmed has offered me a job
at Hillhurst.

16:02.816 --> 16:05.117
Really?

16:05.185 --> 16:07.484
Yes, but she's been
keeping me in suspense.

16:10.789 --> 16:12.790
Well, I will say one thing,
you certainly are...

16:12.825 --> 16:14.658
Persistent.

16:14.727 --> 16:16.493
Well, your sister
is very talented.

16:16.528 --> 16:17.661
She's my good luck charm.

16:20.766 --> 16:21.999
Uh... I would love
to stay and chat,

16:22.034 --> 16:24.102
but I'm late for the diner.

16:24.136 --> 16:25.036
I'll see you tonight, Amy.

16:25.104 --> 16:26.637
Okay.

16:26.671 --> 16:27.871
It was great to see you again.

16:33.377 --> 16:36.312
You need time to think.
I understand completely.

16:36.347 --> 16:38.381
But until you make a decision,

16:38.415 --> 16:39.816
I'd like you to continue
working with Zeus

16:39.851 --> 16:41.351
on a freelance basis.

16:41.385 --> 16:42.786
Yeah, I'd love to.

16:42.820 --> 16:44.721
Good.

16:44.756 --> 16:46.723
Only I'd like to work with him
here at the ranch, if that's okay.

16:46.758 --> 16:48.391
That's fine.

16:48.425 --> 16:51.161
I'll have my staff drop him off
this afternoon.

16:51.195 --> 16:53.263
Actually, I was kinda hoping
you'd be here too.

16:53.297 --> 16:55.365
There's just something
that I wanna try.

16:57.601 --> 16:58.701
<i>So this clown's
doing everything</i>

16:58.736 --> 17:00.202
trying to get
this bull's attention,

17:00.237 --> 17:01.837
and he can't do a thing,
you know?

17:01.872 --> 17:03.606
And he's gettin' desperate,
time's running out.

17:03.641 --> 17:06.175
So all of the sudden,
he has this idea, I guess,

17:06.209 --> 17:07.242
where he's gonna take
his belt off

17:07.278 --> 17:08.778
and drop his drawers!

17:10.012 --> 17:11.381
Well, it's brilliant,

17:11.415 --> 17:13.082
'cause he's wearing
bright red underwear

17:13.116 --> 17:15.183
and the bull sees that,
and takes off right for him!

17:15.217 --> 17:16.851
<i>He turns to run,</i>

17:16.886 --> 17:17.919
<i>but his pants are wrapped</i>
<i>around his ankles.</i>

17:17.987 --> 17:19.655
Face into the dirt!

17:22.223 --> 17:24.259
Just a second, fellows,
just a second.

17:24.294 --> 17:26.627
- Lou, this is great!
- Hi.

17:26.663 --> 17:27.829
See how busy this place is?!

17:27.863 --> 17:29.331
This is the hottest diner
in town!

17:29.399 --> 17:30.799
Don't forget to fill out
a comment card.

17:30.833 --> 17:33.401
It's also the only diner
in town, Dad.

17:33.468 --> 17:34.802
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
but people are so happy!

17:34.836 --> 17:36.203
Come on!
You know what?

17:36.237 --> 17:37.305
That big screen made
the whole difference.

17:37.372 --> 17:39.407
Um, what's with the bronze?

17:39.441 --> 17:41.776
Oh, I thought I'd bring in
some of my old rodeo prizes,

17:41.843 --> 17:43.477
you know, the boys love to talk
about the good old days

17:43.545 --> 17:45.979
and I was thinking
that I might start like

17:46.047 --> 17:47.915
a display of my buckles
and some memorabilia,

17:47.982 --> 17:48.882
spruce the place up.

17:48.950 --> 17:49.850
What do you think?

17:49.918 --> 17:52.219
I think...

17:52.253 --> 17:53.687
Why not?

17:53.721 --> 17:55.855
Great!

17:55.923 --> 17:57.290
Honey, I can't tell you
how much this means to me,

17:57.358 --> 17:58.792
working with you.

17:58.859 --> 18:00.226
I'm having a blast!

18:00.294 --> 18:02.261
Well...
Me too, Dad.

18:02.330 --> 18:03.663
Good.

18:03.698 --> 18:04.464
So what're you doing?

18:04.532 --> 18:05.998
Comment cards.

18:06.066 --> 18:08.067
You know, I figure
since you - we -

18:08.135 --> 18:09.302
have been making
all of these changes,

18:09.337 --> 18:11.237
it's only fair
to let the customers weigh in.

18:11.271 --> 18:12.972
You know, that way,
if patrons don't like something,

18:13.006 --> 18:15.308
management can correct it
immediately.

18:15.375 --> 18:16.575
It's just like you said, Dad.

18:16.643 --> 18:17.643
Give the people what they want.

18:17.711 --> 18:19.245
Right!

18:19.313 --> 18:21.080
I don't see the point.

18:21.114 --> 18:23.449
Everybody loves
my improvements.

18:23.516 --> 18:25.517
Well, you seem awfully sure
about that.

18:25.552 --> 18:26.719
<i>Well, one thing the
good people of Hudson love</i>

18:26.786 --> 18:28.454
is their hockey!

18:28.521 --> 18:29.722
You don't have
to have a marketing degree

18:29.789 --> 18:31.057
to figure that out,
do you, fellas?

18:39.232 --> 18:40.899
Hey, Georgie, how you doin'?

18:40.967 --> 18:42.234
Um, fine.

18:46.373 --> 18:47.506
Ewww!

18:59.551 --> 19:01.286
All right.

19:04.757 --> 19:07.893
Caleb!
What are you doing here?

19:07.960 --> 19:10.262
Look, I've been giving this
a lot of thought

19:10.296 --> 19:12.330
and uh...

19:12.398 --> 19:15.933
Well, I know I don't exactly have a
stellar track record with women,

19:15.967 --> 19:18.435
but... I mean, even I know
that you should've told Amy

19:18.503 --> 19:22.273
about the futurity race
ages ago!

19:22.307 --> 19:24.041
I didn't think
I was gonna have to.

19:24.075 --> 19:25.675
You said this horse
was a sure thing,

19:25.710 --> 19:27.211
it was supposed to be
a simple investment.

19:27.245 --> 19:28.812
Yeah, well, it got complicated!

19:28.880 --> 19:30.847
Now we need Amy.

19:30.882 --> 19:32.849
That's not a good idea, man.

19:32.884 --> 19:34.984
She's got a lot on her plate
right now and...

19:35.019 --> 19:37.287
Ahmed just offered her
this fancy new job.

19:37.321 --> 19:39.389
Seriously, another job?

19:39.424 --> 19:40.690
Dude, that's kinda messed up.

19:42.560 --> 19:44.193
What're you talking about?

19:44.228 --> 19:45.462
If a wealthy
prince flew into town

19:45.496 --> 19:48.965
and started offering my girl
gifts and a job,

19:48.999 --> 19:50.467
well, I just wouldn't be
handling it as well as you are.

19:50.501 --> 19:52.436
It's not like that.

19:52.470 --> 19:54.170
Besides, I don't even think
she's gonna take the job.

19:54.238 --> 19:56.672
Great, then she can help us
with Charger.

19:57.908 --> 19:59.775
Fine, I'll talk to her.

19:59.810 --> 20:01.877
Today?

20:01.912 --> 20:02.578
Yeah, today.

20:11.120 --> 20:12.555
<i>Come on!</i>

20:16.326 --> 20:17.560
Do you need a hand?

20:17.594 --> 20:20.062
No, I am fine.

20:20.096 --> 20:21.830
Here, let me help you.

20:21.897 --> 20:23.531
It's okay, you're just...

20:23.566 --> 20:25.000
You have it too tight,
that's all.

20:25.034 --> 20:26.368
It's much easier
if you do it like this.

20:28.771 --> 20:30.172
You all right?

20:30.206 --> 20:32.140
Uh, yes.

20:32.208 --> 20:34.343
I'm sorry.

20:34.377 --> 20:36.178
I'm a little out of my element.

20:36.212 --> 20:37.579
I'm embarrassed to say

20:37.613 --> 20:38.893
I've never ridden
Western before.

20:38.947 --> 20:40.614
Well, that's okay.

20:40.648 --> 20:43.817
Western really isn't that
much different than English.

20:43.885 --> 20:45.786
What you must think of me.

20:45.820 --> 20:48.189
Ahmed, you don't need
to be embarrassed, all right?

20:48.223 --> 20:49.390
Hey, stick with me
and in no time

20:49.424 --> 20:50.891
you'll be rounding up cattle.

20:54.229 --> 20:56.297
Remind me why we're doing this
in the first place?

20:56.331 --> 20:59.733
Because Zeus has been
too controlled all his life,

20:59.767 --> 21:01.468
too pampered.

21:01.503 --> 21:02.335
So we'll take him out
for a ride,

21:02.403 --> 21:03.804
just let him be a horse,

21:03.872 --> 21:05.973
and he won't have
any pressure of jumping,

21:06.040 --> 21:08.542
or competing,
or anything like that. Okay?

21:15.216 --> 21:17.117
Hey.

21:17.184 --> 21:18.518
Hi.

21:18.585 --> 21:20.085
<i>Hello, Ty.</i>

21:20.153 --> 21:22.021
Amy was kind enough
to work with Zeus today.

21:22.088 --> 21:24.256
I see that.

21:24.324 --> 21:26.325
I thought you were working
a shift at the clinic.

21:26.393 --> 21:27.760
I am, I'm just on break
right now.

21:27.794 --> 21:29.629
So I wanted to talk to you
about something.

21:29.696 --> 21:33.799
Oh, well, um...
What's up?

21:33.867 --> 21:35.701
Ah, it's not important.
You're busy right now, so.

21:35.769 --> 21:38.137
Ty, no, it's fine.

21:38.204 --> 21:40.104
No, no, you're working.
I'll let you get back to it.

21:40.172 --> 21:41.806
Is everything okay?

21:41.841 --> 21:43.842
Yeah... yeah.

21:43.910 --> 21:44.475
Okay.
I'll call you later.

21:44.510 --> 21:45.544
Okay.

21:45.611 --> 21:46.611
Okay.

21:55.454 --> 21:57.989
I've never felt
temperatures like this in my life!

21:58.024 --> 22:00.859
How have you survived all these
years in such a climate?!

22:00.927 --> 22:02.459
It's not that bad.

22:02.527 --> 22:04.795
It's completely intolerable!

22:04.863 --> 22:07.130
Who in their right mind
would be outside right now?!

22:07.165 --> 22:08.405
We should be in a heated arena!

22:10.569 --> 22:11.569
What's so funny?

22:11.603 --> 22:13.503
Nothing.

22:13.538 --> 22:14.972
You're laughing at me?

22:15.006 --> 22:16.740
Well, we have an expression
around here:

22:16.775 --> 22:18.642
"Cowboy up!"

22:18.677 --> 22:20.944
Cowboy up?
What does that mean?

22:20.978 --> 22:22.745
It means stop whining
like a baby

22:22.813 --> 22:24.013
and let's get the job done!

22:28.318 --> 22:29.318
I'm sorry,
I shouldn'tve said that.

22:29.352 --> 22:31.988
No, you are right.

22:32.022 --> 22:33.255
Look, I was just joking.
I didn't mean it, okay?

22:33.290 --> 22:36.759
Yes, you did.

22:36.827 --> 22:39.295
The truth is,

22:39.329 --> 22:43.099
I've been waited on
hand and foot my entire life,

22:43.133 --> 22:46.835
so now I'm not always certain
how to stand on my own two feet.

22:46.869 --> 22:49.504
I appreciate your honesty.

22:49.538 --> 22:51.673
<i>Most people only tell me</i>
<i>what they think I want to hear.</i>

22:51.708 --> 22:52.975
It's because
they're afraid of you.

22:53.009 --> 22:56.945
Yes, but you are not,

22:56.980 --> 22:59.648
and that's why I need you, Amy!

22:59.682 --> 23:01.783
Who else will tell me
to "cowboy up"?

23:13.529 --> 23:15.630
<i>Okay, partner.</i>

23:15.664 --> 23:17.165
Feedback time!

23:17.199 --> 23:18.533
Yeah...

23:18.567 --> 23:21.402
Now, before we get started,

23:21.437 --> 23:23.171
just remember that sometimes
anonymous feedback

23:23.205 --> 23:25.340
can be a little negative.

23:25.374 --> 23:27.642
So the important thing
is not to take it personally,

23:27.676 --> 23:29.177
and instead we'll just focus
on how to move forward

23:29.245 --> 23:30.811
if something isn't working.

23:30.846 --> 23:33.347
Just open the box.

23:33.414 --> 23:34.649
Uh, all right.
Let's see...

23:34.683 --> 23:37.018
Oh! "Love the new TV.

23:37.085 --> 23:40.121
My only complaint is
you didn't install one sooner."

23:40.155 --> 23:42.056
- Okay.
- Okay, that's a good one.

23:42.090 --> 23:43.590
Yeah, just remember that
for every positive comment,

23:43.625 --> 23:44.792
there's usually like
ten negatives, so.

23:44.826 --> 23:46.493
Right, yeah.

23:46.528 --> 23:48.763
"I used to eat at Maggie's
once in a while,

23:48.797 --> 23:50.931
but you guys have
really upped your game -

23:50.966 --> 23:53.534
hockey game, that is."
That's a joke.

23:53.568 --> 23:54.635
Okay. "Now I'm your
newest regular."

23:54.670 --> 23:55.669
So that's a good one.

23:55.703 --> 23:56.970
Okay, oh!
Listen.

23:57.038 --> 23:58.371
"The only thing better
than a cup of coffee

23:58.405 --> 24:00.640
and a slice of saskatoon pie

24:00.708 --> 24:02.275
is enjoying them
while watching the hockey game."

24:02.309 --> 24:03.910
Oh! Another good one!
Okay.

24:03.978 --> 24:06.880
I don't really see
any bad ones in here.

24:06.947 --> 24:09.215
"The TV is way too small.
Please install a bigger one."

24:09.249 --> 24:10.950
Okay, come on, Dad,
you put that one in there!

24:11.018 --> 24:12.185
Lou, I'm tellin' you,

24:12.252 --> 24:13.887
people love the changes
I've made!

24:15.556 --> 24:17.824
Let's just face it,
I am a man of the people.

24:17.858 --> 24:19.292
There has to be a negative
comment in here somewhere.

24:19.359 --> 24:20.927
I mean-
We.

24:20.995 --> 24:23.063
Oh! Okay, no, here.
Here is one.

24:23.130 --> 24:24.898
Oh! Good.

24:24.932 --> 24:26.765
"All of the staff
is really friendly

24:26.833 --> 24:30.035
except for the owner, she...

24:32.606 --> 24:35.374
She has a bit too much attitude
for my liking."

24:35.442 --> 24:36.542
- What?!
- Ok. Lou, honey

24:36.610 --> 24:37.810
the important thing here

24:37.877 --> 24:39.679
is not to take things
personally.

24:39.713 --> 24:41.814
You know, you focus on
the positive things

24:41.881 --> 24:43.382
and try to move forward.

24:43.450 --> 24:45.618
So let's discuss your attitude.

24:48.622 --> 24:50.022
- Ugh.
- It's important.

24:54.960 --> 24:57.195
Caleb, hey.

24:57.263 --> 24:58.029
Can I give you
a hand with this?

24:58.063 --> 24:59.296
Yeah, sure.

25:01.833 --> 25:03.601
I haven't seen you
around lately.

25:03.668 --> 25:06.203
Yeah, well, I've been busy
with work and stuff.

25:06.238 --> 25:08.004
I just thought I'd come around
and see how things are going.

25:08.039 --> 25:09.340
Is Ty here?

25:09.407 --> 25:11.742
Oh, no, he's at the clinic.

25:11.809 --> 25:13.143
Did you get a chance
to talk to him yet?

25:13.177 --> 25:14.077
He came by on his lunch break,
yeah.

25:14.112 --> 25:15.679
Really?

25:15.747 --> 25:17.281
So you know all about
Charger then!

25:17.315 --> 25:18.882
Who?

25:18.950 --> 25:20.618
What?

25:20.685 --> 25:22.018
Who's Charger?

25:22.053 --> 25:23.687
Nobody.

25:23.722 --> 25:24.988
Okay, what's going on?

25:26.357 --> 25:28.358
Nothin'.

25:28.392 --> 25:29.659
<i>When Ty was here this
afternoon he was acting weird</i>

25:29.693 --> 25:31.527
and now so are you!

25:31.562 --> 25:33.403
- I'm not acting weird.
- Yes, you are!

25:35.532 --> 25:36.432
Well, I should probably
get going.

25:36.500 --> 25:38.901
No, you're not going anywhere!

25:38.935 --> 25:40.603
Not until you tell me
what's goin' on.

25:50.180 --> 25:51.581
Are you planning on
eating that cookie,

25:51.615 --> 25:55.217
or just admiring it
for the rest of the night?

25:55.252 --> 25:58.587
I can't eat it;
I feel too guilty.

25:58.621 --> 25:59.354
Hmm.

26:01.357 --> 26:02.724
Okay, why don't you pour us
a glass of milk

26:02.759 --> 26:04.193
and tell me all about it?

26:07.463 --> 26:09.899
Skim or two percent?

26:09.933 --> 26:11.600
We better go
with the strong stuff.

26:11.634 --> 26:12.467
Two percent it is.

26:14.937 --> 26:17.639
Okay, start from the beginning.

26:17.674 --> 26:19.841
Okay, well,
it was a few days ago,

26:19.875 --> 26:21.075
and some of the kids on the bus

26:21.110 --> 26:22.411
were picking on Stephen,

26:22.445 --> 26:24.546
so I told 'em to lay off.

26:24.580 --> 26:26.515
Well, that's a very
brave thing to do.

26:26.549 --> 26:28.750
Why would you feel guilty
about that?

26:28.785 --> 26:30.385
Because now he gave me
these cookies

26:30.420 --> 26:32.020
and I don't know what to do.

26:32.054 --> 26:34.356
I'm not sure I follow.

26:34.390 --> 26:35.657
Well, Stephen's the new kid

26:35.725 --> 26:38.092
and nobody really talks to him.

26:38.127 --> 26:40.028
And I should've thanked him
for the cookies,

26:40.062 --> 26:40.829
but all the kids on the bus
were staring at me,

26:40.896 --> 26:42.997
so I didn't!

26:43.065 --> 26:45.233
That's what makes me
a horrible person.

26:45.301 --> 26:46.734
No, if you were
a horrible person,

26:46.802 --> 26:48.602
you wouldn't have stuck up
for that boy

26:48.637 --> 26:50.705
in the first place.

26:50.772 --> 26:52.841
So do you think
I should talk to him?

26:52.908 --> 26:55.310
Well, I guess that depends
on how concerned you are

26:55.377 --> 26:56.744
about what the other kids
are whispering in the hallway.

26:56.778 --> 26:58.246
Now, personally,

26:58.280 --> 27:00.314
I don't pay much attention
to idle gossip.

27:00.381 --> 27:01.882
But I will tell you one thing,

27:01.916 --> 27:04.151
these cookies look delicious.

27:05.887 --> 27:07.921
Mmm!

27:07.989 --> 27:09.522
Oatmeal chocolate chip.

27:09.557 --> 27:11.158
My favourite.

27:11.226 --> 27:13.560
It's too bad you feel
too guilty to have one.

27:13.627 --> 27:15.462
Oh well, more for me.

27:22.602 --> 27:26.805
So Caleb told me
about the futurity race.

27:26.874 --> 27:28.140
I was gonna tell you.

27:28.208 --> 27:29.041
When?

27:30.677 --> 27:32.278
This afternoon,

27:32.346 --> 27:33.279
but you were busy with Ahmed.

27:35.215 --> 27:37.750
You should've told me
way before today, Ty.

27:39.519 --> 27:40.786
I know.

27:40.820 --> 27:42.554
So why didn't you?

27:42.622 --> 27:44.223
This race is my one shot, Amy!

27:44.291 --> 27:46.092
Your one shot at what?!

27:46.159 --> 27:49.194
Getting us the life we deserve!

27:49.262 --> 27:52.030
But no matter how hard I work,
I can't seem make ends meet.

27:52.064 --> 27:53.698
So when Caleb told me
about this prize money,

27:53.766 --> 27:55.333
I knew I had to try!

27:55.401 --> 27:56.902
So this is all about money?

27:56.969 --> 27:59.004
No, this isn't about money!

27:59.071 --> 28:01.206
I'm gonna be your husband,

28:01.274 --> 28:03.174
and I wanna be able
to buy you that ranch,

28:03.242 --> 28:04.709
or at least contribute
to the down payment.

28:04.777 --> 28:07.078
And you will,
after you're done school!

28:07.113 --> 28:09.180
It...

28:09.248 --> 28:10.581
It may be too late by then.

28:10.649 --> 28:12.550
So what?

28:12.618 --> 28:14.286
Don't pretend like you don't
want this ranch as much as I do!

28:16.122 --> 28:19.490
Yeah, I fell in love
with it, too.

28:19.558 --> 28:21.191
But not enough to gamble away
our life savings!

28:21.259 --> 28:23.360
This isn't gambling.

28:23.395 --> 28:26.263
- This is an investment.
- It's a risky investment!

28:26.298 --> 28:27.432
What happens
if you lose that race?

28:27.466 --> 28:30.401
How are you gonna pay
for school?

28:30.436 --> 28:34.004
I'll figure it out, okay?

28:34.072 --> 28:35.573
I just can't believe you didn't
talk to me about it first.

28:35.607 --> 28:36.607
I had to hear it from Caleb!

28:36.642 --> 28:37.642
This is my money!

28:37.676 --> 28:39.577
It's our future!

28:39.611 --> 28:41.278
I'm doing this for our future!

28:41.313 --> 28:43.013
That's what this is about!

29:04.893 --> 29:06.660
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:06.694 --> 29:08.362
Um, is it okay if I sit here?

29:08.397 --> 29:09.797
You better not.

29:09.831 --> 29:12.967
They're already
talking about us.

29:13.001 --> 29:14.268
Ooh!

29:14.303 --> 29:16.203
Well, I don't care about that.

29:18.240 --> 29:21.508
So, thanks for the cookies.
It was really nice.

29:21.543 --> 29:22.676
You don't have to sit here

29:22.710 --> 29:24.071
just because
you feel sorry for me.

29:24.079 --> 29:25.412
I don't!

29:25.447 --> 29:27.047
Yes, you do.

29:27.081 --> 29:28.682
What you did the other day,
sticking up for me,

29:28.750 --> 29:30.350
it was really cool.

29:30.384 --> 29:32.252
But you should go back
to your seat.

29:32.286 --> 29:36.156
- I wouldn't pick on her.
- No, she's crazy!

29:36.190 --> 29:37.390
There she goes!

29:42.630 --> 29:44.665
I'm sorry I
opened my big mouth.

29:46.733 --> 29:48.601
It's not your fault, Caleb.

29:48.669 --> 29:50.937
I should've told Amy
about Charger a long time ago.

29:50.972 --> 29:52.405
Yeah, well, we have a lot
of money riding on this race.

29:52.440 --> 29:53.739
We need Amy on board.

29:55.843 --> 29:59.112
I'm not sure Amy's
gonna wanna talk to me again.

29:59.146 --> 30:01.381
It can't be that bad.

30:01.449 --> 30:03.783
You guys'll work it out,
you always do.

30:05.619 --> 30:07.319
I really messed up
this time, Caleb.

30:07.387 --> 30:09.889
Just-just call her!

30:09.923 --> 30:12.024
- I gotta go, man.
- No, just...

30:12.092 --> 30:13.526
Forget the race,
forget the horse.

30:13.594 --> 30:15.495
Just call her, tell her
you love her, you know?

30:26.072 --> 30:27.939
All right...

30:49.694 --> 30:51.094
Oh!

30:58.403 --> 31:00.303
He's impossible!
We're getting nowhere!

31:00.338 --> 31:01.739
Put him back in his stall.

31:03.775 --> 31:06.910
Zeus has made
a lot of improvement.

31:06.977 --> 31:08.545
You shouldn't be so frustrated
with him.

31:08.612 --> 31:10.847
It'll only set him back.

31:10.915 --> 31:13.016
In other words,
I should "cowboy up."

31:14.585 --> 31:16.719
So?

31:16.787 --> 31:19.188
Are you finally ready
to end my suspense?

31:19.256 --> 31:20.489
Have you made a decision?

31:20.524 --> 31:22.058
Actually, I have.

31:30.099 --> 31:32.601
- Stephen, wait!
- Get back on the bus!

31:32.635 --> 31:34.736
Georgie, what're you doing?!

31:34.771 --> 31:35.571
Look, I know what it's like
to be the new kid,

31:35.638 --> 31:36.872
and you're not a loser.

31:36.940 --> 31:38.206
So don't let the other kids
make you feel that way!

31:38.240 --> 31:39.174
It's sorta hard not to.

31:40.076 --> 31:40.976
I'm coming!

31:42.845 --> 31:44.612
Look, whenever I'm having
a bad day,

31:44.646 --> 31:46.747
I always hop on my horse
and go for a ride

31:46.782 --> 31:47.882
and that always
makes me feel better.

31:47.916 --> 31:49.750
- I have a horse too..
- You do?

31:49.785 --> 31:52.252
Uh-huh.
His name's Fox.

31:52.287 --> 31:53.420
That's him there.

31:54.322 --> 31:56.423
Just a sec!

31:56.458 --> 31:58.325
Wow! He's beautiful!

31:58.359 --> 32:01.028
Yeah, but I don't get
to ride him that often.

32:01.063 --> 32:03.497
- How come?
- He lives with my dad in Manitoba.

32:03.531 --> 32:04.798
Well, you should come
over to Heartland,

32:04.832 --> 32:06.700
we've got tons of horses.
Maybe we could go riding.

32:06.734 --> 32:07.767
- Really?
- Yeah!

32:07.802 --> 32:09.535
I gotta go!

32:09.570 --> 32:10.804
<i>Thank you, Georgie!</i>

32:15.876 --> 32:17.410
<i>And now he's really going...</i>

32:17.444 --> 32:18.511
<i>Here he comes up the boards!</i>
<i>Yes!</i>

32:18.545 --> 32:20.379
<i>Pass across,</i>

32:20.414 --> 32:22.482
<i>and it's picked off in the zone</i>

32:22.516 --> 32:23.683
<i>and it's brought back out</i>
<i>along the boards...</i>

32:23.718 --> 32:25.084
All right!

32:25.118 --> 32:28.186
Okay, these are-
BBQ, right?

32:28.221 --> 32:31.356
<i>And... you have the...</i>

32:33.426 --> 32:34.893
<i>Will you look at him,</i>

32:34.928 --> 32:36.762
walking around
like he owns the place!

32:36.796 --> 32:37.997
Uh, he does own the place.

32:38.031 --> 32:40.099
Only part of it, okay?

32:40.133 --> 32:41.066
And that does not give him
the right

32:41.101 --> 32:43.068
to turn it into a sports bar!

32:45.071 --> 32:47.172
You know what?
I cannot stand this anymore!

32:47.206 --> 32:49.040
This is not what I want.

32:49.074 --> 32:49.907
What are you doing?

32:49.975 --> 32:51.943
Saving my diner!

32:52.011 --> 32:52.977
- Lou... calm down.
- I am calm.

32:55.814 --> 32:57.582
<i>He's got it!
Oh! And it's picked off-</i>

32:57.650 --> 32:59.184
Yeah! Oh, yes! Yes!
Yes! Go! Go! Come on, guys!

32:59.218 --> 33:00.051
- Let go.
- No.

33:00.119 --> 33:02.521
I said, let go!

33:02.588 --> 33:03.821
<i>They're gonna get it!
He's gonna do it!</i>

33:03.856 --> 33:04.556
Let... go!

33:07.459 --> 33:08.526
<i>Gets
the pass back, he shoots-</i>

33:12.531 --> 33:14.132
The TV seems to be
malfunctioning.

33:14.199 --> 33:16.367
I'm sorry, but I would like
to offer everyone

33:16.434 --> 33:18.275
fifteen percent off
the chicken pot pie special

33:18.336 --> 33:19.537
<i>for the next half hour.</i>

33:19.604 --> 33:21.873
Just stay calm, folks.

33:21.907 --> 33:23.975
I can fix this.

33:28.279 --> 33:29.813
Oh, there we go!
Game on!

33:34.819 --> 33:36.953
Lou...

33:37.021 --> 33:38.188
I saw you with the changer.

33:38.255 --> 33:40.791
Malfunction?
Are you crazy?!

33:40.858 --> 33:42.759
I'm not just gonna stand here
and watch you take over, Dad!

33:42.827 --> 33:44.127
- That's not what I was doing!
- Yes, it was!

33:44.195 --> 33:45.929
I am just trying to help!

33:45.963 --> 33:47.883
Well, you know what?
I never asked for your help!

33:47.931 --> 33:49.799
Well, I thought you were good
with all this.

33:49.866 --> 33:50.933
I didn't want to hurt
your feelings, Dad,

33:51.001 --> 33:54.103
but I am not good with this!

33:54.171 --> 33:56.038
Well, people love my changes.

33:56.073 --> 33:57.372
Read your comment cards!

33:57.440 --> 33:59.008
Do you know how hard
I work every day

33:59.076 --> 34:00.743
to keep this place open?

34:00.811 --> 34:02.745
And then you waltz in
with your big screen TV

34:02.813 --> 34:04.814
and you think you know
what it is to run a diner?!

34:04.848 --> 34:07.049
Well, you don't, okay?

34:07.084 --> 34:08.949
Dad, Maggie's is my dream,
not yours!

34:11.087 --> 34:13.088
So I guess I'm just
your silent partner.

34:13.155 --> 34:15.556
I'll shut up and I'll go.

34:17.626 --> 34:18.226
Excuse me.

34:43.443 --> 34:45.510
Look, Amy, I know you're upset.

34:45.578 --> 34:47.212
Can we just talk about this?

34:54.186 --> 34:56.487
I'm sorry!

34:56.522 --> 34:57.521
I know that's not good enough,

34:57.556 --> 34:59.289
but I don't know
what else to say.

34:59.324 --> 35:00.924
Are you apologizing
for keeping secrets,

35:00.959 --> 35:04.027
or because you want me
to work with Charger?

35:04.062 --> 35:05.563
This is about you and me, Amy.
Forget the horse.

35:05.597 --> 35:08.265
I can't just forget it, Ty!

35:08.299 --> 35:10.468
I've been thinking
about this, Amy,

35:10.502 --> 35:12.503
and I can ask Scott
for an advance,

35:12.537 --> 35:13.771
or I can get a student loan.

35:13.805 --> 35:16.006
Ty, I already accepted the job.

35:18.642 --> 35:20.777
What?

35:20.811 --> 35:23.212
I didn't really have
any other choice.

35:23.247 --> 35:25.014
I start tomorrow.

35:30.454 --> 35:33.189
And you were mad at me
for keeping secrets.

35:37.427 --> 35:39.495
Well, congratulations
on your new job.

35:53.475 --> 35:55.110
Hey there!

35:57.813 --> 35:59.447
You okay?

35:59.481 --> 36:01.248
Yeah...

36:01.316 --> 36:03.451
<i>Are you sure about that?</i>

36:04.453 --> 36:05.986
Hey...

36:10.192 --> 36:11.526
It's all wrecked, Grandpa.

36:11.810 --> 36:13.110
What is?

36:14.246 --> 36:16.514
Me and Ty.

36:16.549 --> 36:17.982
Did you have a fight?

36:21.153 --> 36:22.720
I'd rather not talk about it.

36:22.788 --> 36:23.453
Okay.

36:27.759 --> 36:30.194
I just never say
the right thing.

36:30.261 --> 36:32.329
Amy, you don't have
to say anything.

36:37.903 --> 36:38.868
Thank you.

36:42.673 --> 36:45.875
Look, I'm sure business
is gonna pick up eventually!

36:45.943 --> 36:48.745
I'm just happy to be rid
of that awful television.

36:51.248 --> 36:54.417
- What's this?
- It's a sales report.

36:54.484 --> 36:56.285
Not only have food and beverage
sales increased

36:56.320 --> 36:59.089
twenty-two percent
in the last week,

36:59.156 --> 37:00.222
<i>we've actually moved</i>
<i>more merchandise</i>

37:00.256 --> 37:01.156
in the tack store.

37:03.359 --> 37:05.194
<i>Do you remember what we used</i>
<i>to do back in the day,</i>

37:05.261 --> 37:07.863
when some young,
hotshot junior associate

37:07.897 --> 37:09.497
would join the firm?

37:09.565 --> 37:11.233
We would try to destroy them.

37:11.300 --> 37:12.734
Right.

37:12.768 --> 37:14.035
But every once in a while,

37:14.069 --> 37:16.337
they'd come up
with a good idea.

37:16.404 --> 37:17.304
And if we couldn't
destroy them,

37:17.372 --> 37:18.806
we would join them

37:18.874 --> 37:22.210
and help each other to the top.

37:22.277 --> 37:23.611
I know things are different
with you and your dad,

37:23.645 --> 37:24.979
but his ideas aren't terrible.

37:30.819 --> 37:32.386
Lou was acting
like a spoiled brat.

37:32.420 --> 37:35.189
I'm just glad
I watched the game at home.

37:35.224 --> 37:36.724
Yeah, well, you'd think
she'd be a little more grateful

37:36.791 --> 37:37.758
for all the business
that I brought in.

37:37.825 --> 37:39.592
You know what you need, Tim?

37:39.627 --> 37:40.627
A hobby!

37:42.096 --> 37:43.196
Go on.

37:43.231 --> 37:45.298
You're bored!

37:45.332 --> 37:47.033
You've got too much time
on your hands.

37:47.068 --> 37:48.601
You need a hobby.

37:48.636 --> 37:51.004
Personally,
I enjoy tying flies.

37:51.072 --> 37:52.372
But some men your age,

37:52.406 --> 37:54.307
they take up woodworking
or golf.

37:54.341 --> 37:57.310
Try ballroom dancing,
I don't care!

37:57.344 --> 37:59.512
Anything except for messing
around in your kids' lives!

37:59.546 --> 38:01.581
Well, thanks for the advice,
Jack.

38:01.615 --> 38:04.549
I don't need a hobby.

38:04.584 --> 38:06.051
I'm lousy at golf, anyway!

38:09.890 --> 38:11.824
<i>I just feel so betrayed.</i>

38:11.858 --> 38:13.125
That doesn't sound like Ty
at all!

38:13.160 --> 38:15.127
Well, the worst part is,

38:15.162 --> 38:16.662
I was so mad
I didn't even tell him

38:16.696 --> 38:19.298
before I accepted
Ahmed's job offer.

38:19.332 --> 38:20.565
You took the job?

38:20.600 --> 38:22.268
Yeah.

38:22.302 --> 38:24.403
Amy, I could be way off,

38:24.437 --> 38:25.671
but I've been around
long enough to know

38:25.705 --> 38:27.439
that when Ahmed looks at you,

38:27.473 --> 38:29.641
it's with more
than professional admiration.

38:29.676 --> 38:31.376
What?
Lou, that's crazy!

38:31.411 --> 38:32.844
I might be wrong.

38:32.878 --> 38:34.946
But in case I'm not,
just... be careful.

38:36.783 --> 38:38.317
- Hey.
- Hey, Georgie.

38:38.351 --> 38:39.217
How was school?

38:39.251 --> 38:41.052
Fine.

38:41.086 --> 38:41.886
Good. Oh hey,
don't eat too much;

38:41.921 --> 38:43.288
dinner's almost ready.

38:43.323 --> 38:44.956
Okay, Lou,

38:44.990 --> 38:46.490
can I have a friend over
after school tomorrow?

38:46.525 --> 38:47.926
Yeah, sure.
What's her name?

38:47.960 --> 38:49.060
His name is Stephen.

38:51.096 --> 38:54.866
Uh... Stephen.
Y-yes. For sure.

38:54.900 --> 38:56.935
I look forward to meeting him.

39:05.377 --> 39:08.011
<i>I feel like
this is all my fault.</i>

39:08.079 --> 39:10.180
Ty didn't have to invest
in that horse

39:10.248 --> 39:14.051
and he definitely didn't
have to keep it from me.

39:14.085 --> 39:16.086
Believe me, I mean, come on,

39:16.154 --> 39:18.322
you know Ty would never do
anything to hurt you.

39:18.356 --> 39:19.789
I mean, not on purpose.

39:22.626 --> 39:24.995
Charger's a great horse.

39:25.063 --> 39:26.330
We could make a killing
at the futurity race,

39:26.397 --> 39:29.098
I know it,
just... not without you.

39:32.503 --> 39:34.437
Look, I know what Ty did
was wrong,

39:34.505 --> 39:36.573
but maybe we can make it
right together.

39:36.640 --> 39:37.841
What do you say?

39:39.643 --> 39:40.910
We need you!

39:50.779 --> 39:52.147
<i>So this is Phoenix.</i>

39:52.215 --> 39:54.116
Hey, buddy.

39:54.183 --> 39:56.018
Man, he's huge.

39:56.086 --> 39:56.986
Yeah, you should see him jump.

39:57.053 --> 39:58.453
He's amazing!

39:58.521 --> 40:00.455
Hey, Georgie.

40:00.490 --> 40:01.956
<i>I thought I would just come by</i>

40:01.991 --> 40:04.326
and see how you kids
were doing.

40:04.393 --> 40:06.495
Are you guys hungry?
Did you want a snack or...

40:06.562 --> 40:09.097
Um, I think we're okay, thanks.

40:09.132 --> 40:10.465
Well, how about I help
you saddle up Phoenix?

40:10.533 --> 40:12.834
Actually, we can handle it
on our own.

40:12.901 --> 40:15.270
Okay.

40:15.304 --> 40:17.105
Well, I will be in the office
if you guys need...

40:17.173 --> 40:18.906
Anything.

40:18.941 --> 40:19.673
Okay.

40:21.876 --> 40:22.976
Bye.

40:23.044 --> 40:23.944
Oh, yeah. Bye.

40:31.052 --> 40:32.719
I got your message.

40:32.754 --> 40:33.875
Thanks for coming to meet me.

40:33.888 --> 40:35.489
Um...

40:35.524 --> 40:37.558
There's something
I wanted to show you.

40:40.761 --> 40:42.662
More complaints
from the "feedback box"?

40:42.729 --> 40:44.397
<i>No. It's a sales report.</i>

40:46.500 --> 40:50.836
Thanks to your ideas,
business has been booming.

40:50.871 --> 40:53.005
And I want you to know
I took down the big screen TV,

40:53.073 --> 40:55.808
but then I put it back up
because...

40:55.842 --> 40:56.742
You were right.

41:00.381 --> 41:03.216
Dad, I'm ashamed of the way
I acted last night.

41:04.584 --> 41:05.284
Don't be.

41:07.721 --> 41:09.789
I've forgotten all about it.

41:09.823 --> 41:11.757
Look,

41:11.792 --> 41:14.026
Nicole's going back to New York
for a couple of weeks

41:14.061 --> 41:14.827
and I could use
an extra set of hands.

41:14.861 --> 41:16.862
So...

41:16.897 --> 41:18.263
You have good instincts
about running the diner

41:18.298 --> 41:20.432
and maybe we should
do it together.

41:22.435 --> 41:24.070
No.

41:24.104 --> 41:26.205
Excuse me?

41:26.239 --> 41:27.573
You were right, Lou.

41:27.607 --> 41:29.408
The diner was your dream,
not mine.

41:29.442 --> 41:31.442
I'm confused.
You seemed so into it before.

41:31.476 --> 41:34.378
I was into it before,

41:34.413 --> 41:36.447
but for all the wrong reasons,

41:36.481 --> 41:40.384
and I'm glad that you used
some of my good ideas,

41:40.419 --> 41:43.188
<i>but let's face it...</i>

41:43.222 --> 41:46.357
You're really the one that's
qualified to run that business

41:46.391 --> 41:47.826
and the last thing you need
is your old dad

41:47.860 --> 41:49.527
cramping your style.

41:49.561 --> 41:51.329
You weren't cramping my style!

41:51.396 --> 41:53.664
Yeah, I was cramping
your style, Lou.

41:56.368 --> 42:00.538
So how about I just go back
to being your silent partner?

42:00.572 --> 42:02.840
How about instead of being
a silent partner,

42:02.874 --> 42:04.742
you speak up
when you have an idea,

42:04.776 --> 42:08.011
and this time
I promise I'll listen.

42:08.079 --> 42:11.382
A silent partner with a voice?

42:11.416 --> 42:12.250
I like it!

42:14.419 --> 42:15.653
You sure you'll like that?

42:15.721 --> 42:17.821
Yeah, I am.

42:21.992 --> 42:23.472
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

42:26.530 --> 42:28.298
♪ Are we waiting

42:31.502 --> 42:33.436
♪ on what may never come?

42:38.842 --> 42:39.875
I thought you were
working at Hillhurst today.

42:39.942 --> 42:41.343
I left early.

42:41.411 --> 42:42.578
We need to talk.

42:44.080 --> 42:46.148
Okay.

42:46.182 --> 42:48.684
I've been thinking
a lot about Charger,

42:48.752 --> 42:50.419
and I'd like to take
a look at him,

42:50.487 --> 42:53.822
see if there's anything
that I can do to help.

42:53.890 --> 42:57.760
I can come by the arena
tomorrow morning.

42:57.827 --> 43:00.928
I don't understand, Amy.
What about your job with Ahmed?
