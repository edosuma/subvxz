Hey lyndsey,
just calling to say good night.

00:08.042 --> 00:10.376
Oh, oh,
you're in bed already?

00:10.378 --> 00:14.747
So, uh,
what are you wearing?

00:14.749 --> 00:15.948
Really?

00:15.950 --> 00:17.349
What kind of sweat pants?

00:18.718 --> 00:22.621
Ooh,
big, old gray ones.

00:22.623 --> 00:26.258
Is it just me or are you
getting turned on, too?

00:26.260 --> 00:29.328
It's...J-j-just me?

00:29.330 --> 00:30.262
Well, that's fine.

00:30.264 --> 00:32.965
I do some of my best work alone.

00:32.967 --> 00:35.200
All right, all right,
go to sleep.

00:35.202 --> 00:36.235
I love you.

00:36.237 --> 00:37.369
Do you love...?

00:39.072 --> 00:40.639

Oh, great.

(awkward laugh)

02:18.272 --> 02:19.571
Sorry about what?

02:19.573 --> 02:21.673
The fact that
my date and I came home

02:21.675 --> 02:23.509
Last night to find
a middle-aged man

02:23.511 --> 02:25.911
Spraying water
all over my kitchen

02:25.913 --> 02:28.780
In his tighty
not-so-whities?

02:28.782 --> 02:31.517
I was putting out a fire.

02:31.519 --> 02:33.585
I'm a hero.

Really?

02:34.889 --> 02:36.588

posing for

02:36.590 --> 02:38.557

firemen calendar.

02:40.860 --> 02:41.660
Okay, okay, I get it.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.195
You're a little upset.

02:43.197 --> 02:46.298
But I have something that will
make you feel better.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.033
♪ ta-da.

02:48.035 --> 02:50.035
I went out to the drugstore

02:50.037 --> 02:52.271
And bought you a new toaster
to replace the old one.

02:55.074 --> 02:56.909
The other one was better.

02:57.477 --> 02:59.211
Better?!

02:59.213 --> 03:01.446
This is the toastblaster deluxe.

03:01.448 --> 03:04.483
This is the best thing to happen
to sliced bread since...

03:04.485 --> 03:06.185
Sliced bread.

03:06.187 --> 03:08.687
But mine had glass walls,

03:08.689 --> 03:10.923
So you could watch the
toast turn tropical brown.

03:10.925 --> 03:13.392
It was like a... Little...

03:13.394 --> 03:15.861
Bread tanning booth.

03:17.997 --> 03:19.298
Well, check this out, you know.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.033
Light, dark.

03:21.035 --> 03:22.668
Dark...

03:22.670 --> 03:24.903
Light.

03:24.905 --> 03:28.307
Okay, that's, uh...

03:28.309 --> 03:29.675
That-that's supposed to happen.

03:29.677 --> 03:31.476
That's ac-- that's actually
a safety feature.

03:31.478 --> 03:33.378
You know,
common courtesy dictates

03:33.380 --> 03:35.380
That if you're
gonna use my stuff

03:35.382 --> 03:36.715
And break my stuff,

03:36.717 --> 03:37.916
That you replace my stuff

03:37.918 --> 03:40.185
With equally awesome stuff.

03:40.187 --> 03:42.688
This-this-this
is what would happen

03:42.690 --> 03:45.224
If my toaster took a crap.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.527
What are you talking about?

03:48.529 --> 03:50.262
This is a
perfectly good toaster.

03:50.264 --> 03:52.598
Look, okay, you know what?
I'll prove it to you.

03:56.269 --> 03:57.970
Hope you're hungry.

03:57.972 --> 04:00.906

04:02.141 --> 04:06.445
(loudly):
Listen to that baby purr!

04:06.447 --> 04:09.381
(loudly):
I hate you.

04:14.153 --> 04:16.154

By the way,

04:16.156 --> 04:17.155
In case I forget.

04:17.157 --> 04:19.091
I might be a little
late on Monday.

04:19.093 --> 04:20.092
Oh, no problem.

04:20.094 --> 04:21.393
When should
I expect you?

04:21.395 --> 04:24.296
Wednesday.

04:24.298 --> 04:26.865
Should I dock you
for the time you miss?

04:26.867 --> 04:28.700
I wouldn't.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.971

04:40.213 --> 04:41.213
Here you go.

04:41.215 --> 04:42.814
What's this?

04:42.816 --> 04:44.783
I went to the store
and I asked them,

04:44.785 --> 04:46.518
"what is the
stupidest thing I can buy?"

04:46.520 --> 04:47.786
And they
gave me this toaster.

04:47.788 --> 04:48.954
Enjoy.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.056
You know,
you didn't have to do that.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.958
Ah, you made it pretty clear
that I did.

04:52.960 --> 04:56.295
In fact, I forwent replacing
my cell phone to buy this.

04:56.297 --> 04:58.397
"forwent"?

04:58.399 --> 05:01.033
It's a word.

05:01.035 --> 05:02.167
Well, I appreciate it.

05:02.169 --> 05:03.602
Thank you.

05:03.604 --> 05:06.171
Uh, and you don't have to worry
about me ruining that one,

05:06.173 --> 05:07.572
Because
I will never use it.

05:07.574 --> 05:09.141
Okay, stop being ridiculous.

05:09.143 --> 05:10.208
(scoffing)

05:10.210 --> 05:11.677
You want to know what's
ridiculous?

05:11.679 --> 05:13.178
A glass toaster.

05:13.180 --> 05:13.979
What's next?

05:13.981 --> 05:15.047
A glass toilet,

05:15.049 --> 05:17.482
So you can wave good-bye
to the toast?

05:21.487 --> 05:23.689
How about a glass front door

05:23.691 --> 05:25.490
So I can wave good-bye to you?

05:25.492 --> 05:28.493
Oh, please!
You would be lost without me.

05:28.495 --> 05:31.763
I would be
lost without <i>you?</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

05:31.765 --> 05:35.967
Okay, the only thing that you've
brought into my life

05:35.969 --> 05:38.103
Is an oil-leaking volvo,

05:38.105 --> 05:40.639
A musty smell in
my guest room

05:40.641 --> 05:42.574
And the word "forwent."

05:42.576 --> 05:44.743
It is the past tense
of "forgo."

05:44.745 --> 05:46.111
Edify yourself, sir.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.414

But I am the one constant?

05:52.886 --> 05:53.919
I am always here.

05:53.921 --> 05:55.554
Maybe the reason
they come and go

05:55.556 --> 05:58.090
Is because you are always here.

05:58.092 --> 05:59.991
When a woman dumps you,
who picks up the pieces?

05:59.993 --> 06:00.992

09:48.155 --> 09:50.488
And your expired
mexican boner pills.

09:55.661 --> 09:58.063
Is it lonely up there, walden?

09:59.465 --> 10:03.301
Is it lonely
on your cloud of judgment?

10:03.303 --> 10:06.171
I don't know, maybe you could
leave, so I could find out.

10:06.173 --> 10:08.707
All right,
then, good-bye.

10:10.476 --> 10:12.444
Berta, are you crying?

10:12.446 --> 10:14.746
(crying):
I can't help it.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.915
I'm just so damn happy.

10:17.883 --> 10:20.352
♪ <i>men...</i> ♪

10:22.154 --> 10:23.555
♪ <i>men...</i> ♪

10:23.557 --> 10:25.590
Here you go.

10:25.592 --> 10:28.727
Two eggs over easy,
silver dollar pancakes,

10:28.729 --> 10:32.931
Apple wood smoked bacon
and whole grain toast.

10:32.933 --> 10:35.367
(chuckling):
This is delightful, alan.

10:35.369 --> 10:37.535
You really know
how to spoil your man.

10:38.971 --> 10:40.605
And you know
how to flatter yours.

10:41.741 --> 10:43.742
Wow, it seems
like just yesterday

10:43.744 --> 10:45.377
I was living
here with judith.

10:45.379 --> 10:46.544
Only difference now is,

10:46.546 --> 10:48.713
I actually have a
chance at getting laid.

10:48.715 --> 10:51.416
Well, if dinner's
as good as breakfast,

10:51.418 --> 10:52.817
You've got
more than a chance.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.519
(laughing)

10:54.521 --> 10:55.520
Seriously,
I-I really appreciate

10:55.522 --> 10:56.788
You letting
me stay here.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.657
Ah, well, it's nice to
have someone around again.

10:58.659 --> 11:00.792
It's been a little
lonely since judith left.

11:00.794 --> 11:02.794
I found it lonely
even when judith was here.

11:02.796 --> 11:05.397
Mm... Yeah, I've
been watching tv alone

11:05.399 --> 11:07.399
And drinking alone.

11:07.401 --> 11:09.200
I even painted a
moustache on the bathroom mirror

11:09.202 --> 11:10.502
So I'd have
someone to talk to.

11:10.504 --> 11:13.405
R... Really?

11:13.407 --> 11:16.007
Yeah. I call him javier.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.476
(latin accent):
Don't worry, herb,
you're better off.

11:18.478 --> 11:21.680
"yudith," she's a "beetch."

11:21.682 --> 11:24.149
Can't argue with javier.

11:24.151 --> 11:27.218
No, no, I wouldn't--
he's got a fiery latin temper.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.487
And a machete.

11:33.926 --> 11:36.194
Um, l-let me ask you something.

11:37.129 --> 11:38.830
Does herb have a machete?

11:44.003 --> 11:46.037
(footsteps approaching)

11:46.039 --> 11:47.238
Morning.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.740
Morning.

11:48.742 --> 11:51.409
Hey, berta, knock, knock.

11:51.411 --> 11:52.477
Who's there?

11:52.479 --> 11:53.511
Not alan.

11:53.513 --> 11:55.180
(laughing)

11:55.182 --> 11:57.182
Free at last, walden.

11:57.184 --> 11:59.451
Thank god almighty,
we're free at last.

11:59.453 --> 12:02.821
Yeah. Although it is
a little quieter around here.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.789
Get a dog-- then it
won't seem so weird

12:04.791 --> 12:06.624
When you catch him
trying to lick himself.

12:07.827 --> 12:09.327
Hey, berta?
Yeah?

12:09.329 --> 12:11.396
What do you think about
turning alan's room

12:11.398 --> 12:12.797
Into a home gym?

12:12.799 --> 12:15.266
Well, I was thinking about
trying to grow pot in there,

12:15.268 --> 12:16.634
But okay.

12:16.636 --> 12:18.303
Hey, berta?

12:18.305 --> 12:19.204
Yeah?

12:19.206 --> 12:21.172
What's going on with you?

12:21.174 --> 12:22.574
What do you mean?

12:22.576 --> 12:24.375
I don't know. Like...

12:24.377 --> 12:26.144
How's your family?

12:26.146 --> 12:28.146
Incarcerated.
(laughs)

12:28.148 --> 12:30.348
That's funny.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.050
Okay. Good talk.

12:32.052 --> 12:34.052
Hey... Berta?

12:34.054 --> 12:35.320
Yeah?

12:35.322 --> 12:36.321
Knock, knock.

12:36.323 --> 12:37.756
Who's there?

12:37.758 --> 12:39.390
It's walden. Let me in.

12:42.228 --> 12:44.429
What are your hopes?
What are your dreams?

12:44.431 --> 12:46.865
I'm just hoping to get
out of this conversation.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.199
(chuckles)

12:48.201 --> 12:49.868
You're... You're
on fire today.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.169
Yeah.

12:51.171 --> 12:52.504
Hey, berta?

12:52.506 --> 12:55.740
Oh, for the love of god, what?

12:55.742 --> 12:56.841
I like your vest.

12:58.310 --> 12:59.944
Thanks.

12:59.946 --> 13:02.647
Where'd you get it, like,
the vest store or something?

13:04.083 --> 13:06.718
Thank god I'm high.

13:15.661 --> 13:17.162
Easy, easy.

13:17.164 --> 13:19.998
Sound the horn, let
the townfolk know you're coming.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.167
(train whistle blows)

13:22.169 --> 13:26.104
The 9:04 from pemberton,
now arriving on track one.

13:26.106 --> 13:27.839
Right on time.

13:27.841 --> 13:30.208
I-I had no idea
this was so much fun.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.209
I know.

13:31.211 --> 13:32.944
(gasps)
look, alan...

13:32.946 --> 13:35.446
The mcdougal boy's
coming home from college.

13:36.682 --> 13:38.683
What a reunion this will be.

13:38.685 --> 13:40.718
Welcome home, jimmy!

13:40.720 --> 13:43.454
Wow, you've, uh, created
your own little world here.

13:43.456 --> 13:45.323
Oh, yeah,
and this world's perfect.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.392
Well... Almost perfect.

13:48.294 --> 13:49.527
Jimmy's brother bobby

13:49.529 --> 13:51.996
Got a little too close
to the tracks one night.

13:51.998 --> 13:54.833
Him and his friends were playing
chicken with a freight train.

13:56.435 --> 13:59.737
They found his letterman jacket
three towns away.

13:59.739 --> 14:01.573
Oh, no.
Yeah.

14:01.575 --> 14:03.408
Engineer stan never got over it.

14:03.410 --> 14:05.243
He stopped talking to helen.

14:05.245 --> 14:07.612
He just sits in his room
and paints.

14:10.583 --> 14:13.451
Huh. That's, uh...
That's disturbing.

14:13.453 --> 14:16.154
On a couple of levels.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.056
You know it's
so nice having you.

14:18.058 --> 14:21.459
I don't know why, but train
enthusiasts tend to be loners.

14:21.461 --> 14:24.062
Yeah. It's a mystery.

14:24.064 --> 14:25.930
(phone rings)

14:25.932 --> 14:27.232
Hello?

14:27.234 --> 14:29.767
Hey, herb. It's walden.

14:29.769 --> 14:31.436
Oh. Hey, hold on a sec.

14:31.438 --> 14:33.238
Uh, I got to take this;
it's the office.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.273
No problem. I was thinking
of heading over to the bar car

14:35.275 --> 14:37.342
To pick us up a couple
of frosty brews. You want one?

14:37.344 --> 14:38.843
Oh, make mine a root beer.

14:38.845 --> 14:40.478
This town's seen enough tragedy.

14:43.949 --> 14:44.949
(door closes)

14:44.951 --> 14:46.017
Hey, what's up?

14:46.019 --> 14:47.318
Is alan there?

14:47.320 --> 14:49.587
Uh, actually, no,
I haven't seen him all day.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.155
I was really hoping
to talk to him.

14:51.157 --> 14:53.858
You can't talk
to a person that's not here.

14:53.860 --> 14:56.227
Unless you draw a mustache
on the mirror.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.762
What?

14:57.764 --> 14:59.264
Is there a message
I can give him?

14:59.266 --> 15:01.165
Yeah, just tell him
I think I overreacted,

15:01.167 --> 15:02.834
And have him give me a call.

15:03.435 --> 15:05.203
Done and done. Bye-bye.

15:05.205 --> 15:07.238
Everything okay at the office?

15:07.240 --> 15:09.540
Uh, actually, it,
uh, it wasn't work.

15:09.542 --> 15:10.508
No?

15:10.510 --> 15:11.609
It was the, uh,

15:11.611 --> 15:12.810
President of the railroad.

15:12.812 --> 15:14.646
He asked me to give you this.

15:16.248 --> 15:17.882
Congratulations, conductor alan!

15:17.884 --> 15:19.284
Oh, my god! Thank you!

15:19.286 --> 15:20.551
Now, let's get
that coal car unloaded

15:20.553 --> 15:22.520
And head over to the diner.

15:22.522 --> 15:24.555
Take a look at the new waitress.
Ooh!

15:24.557 --> 15:25.590
Word around town is,

15:25.592 --> 15:27.392
(whispers):
She goes all the way.

15:35.734 --> 15:37.702
(computer beeping)

15:37.704 --> 15:39.070
Hey, jake!

15:39.072 --> 15:40.138
Walden.

15:40.140 --> 15:42.640
How are you?
What's going on, buddy?

15:42.642 --> 15:45.410
Not much.
Is my dad there?

15:45.412 --> 15:48.112
No. He actually moved out.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.748
(laughing):
Good one!

15:50.750 --> 15:51.916
No, I'm-I'm serious.

15:51.918 --> 15:54.285
We got in a fight,
and he left.

15:54.287 --> 15:57.221
My dad left that house?

15:57.223 --> 16:00.558
Yeah. We got in a fight, 'cause
he bought a cheap toaster.

16:00.560 --> 16:01.960
W-wait, wait.

16:01.962 --> 16:05.296
<i>And</i> he bought something?

16:05.298 --> 16:09.067
Yeah. And I didn't show
any appreciation for it.

16:09.069 --> 16:11.903
He bought something
with his own money?

16:11.905 --> 16:14.539
I know. I shouldn't
have screamed at him.

16:14.541 --> 16:17.575
I-I should have
thrown him a parade.

16:17.577 --> 16:21.045
Wait a second,
am I being punk'd?

16:22.314 --> 16:24.315
Hey, you know, I got an idea.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.884
Um, you know, just 'cause your
dad doesn't live here anymore

16:26.886 --> 16:29.721
Doesn't mean that you couldn't
come stay for a couple of days.

16:29.723 --> 16:31.089
And do what?

16:31.091 --> 16:33.758
I don't know,
like hang out, do guy stuff.

16:33.760 --> 16:36.327
We could go to a bar
and get drunk.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.830
Mm, I'm only 19; I can't drink.

16:38.832 --> 16:41.165
Well, fine,
we could just get high.

16:41.167 --> 16:44.902
Dude, just call my dad and tell
him you want him to come back.

16:44.904 --> 16:46.904
What if he says no?

16:46.906 --> 16:48.706
(snickers, laughs)

16:49.842 --> 16:51.909
Oh, you're serious.

16:51.911 --> 16:53.978
He's not gonna say no.

16:53.980 --> 16:56.080
Where has he even been living?

16:56.082 --> 16:58.583
He moved into you guys's
old house with herb.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.918
Wow. If there was
a freeloaders hall of fame,

17:00.920 --> 17:02.920
My dad would be living in it.

17:04.289 --> 17:06.824
For free.

17:08.627 --> 17:10.695
(doorbell rings)

17:16.602 --> 17:18.603
Hi, herb.

17:18.605 --> 17:20.972
Walden. What are
you doing here?

17:20.974 --> 17:22.206
I came to talk to alan.

17:22.208 --> 17:23.674
Oh.
Sorry, he's not home.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.376
I'll tell him
you stopped by.
Alan: Who's at the door?

17:25.378 --> 17:27.045
Nobody! Go back
in the train room!

17:28.313 --> 17:29.213
Alan?

17:29.215 --> 17:30.982
Walden?

17:30.984 --> 17:32.984
What's, uh,
what's going on?

17:32.986 --> 17:34.619
I wanted to say that I'm sorry.

17:34.621 --> 17:36.220
Really?
Yes.

17:36.222 --> 17:37.422
Super. Hatchet buried.

17:37.424 --> 17:38.523
We'll have you over
for thanksgiving.

17:38.525 --> 17:40.458
Hold on.

17:40.460 --> 17:44.495
I never meant to make you
feel unwelcome in my home.

17:44.497 --> 17:47.331
Well, alan has
a new place now.

17:47.333 --> 17:49.400
A place where
he's appreciated.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.335
A place where
he feels safe.

17:52.638 --> 17:55.106
A place where he can cry
himself to sleep at night

17:55.108 --> 17:57.942
Without the fear
of being mocked.

17:57.944 --> 17:59.777
Y-you heard that?

17:59.779 --> 18:01.612
There's still
a baby monitor in there.

18:01.614 --> 18:04.582
So you also heard...

18:04.584 --> 18:06.884
Let it go, alan.

18:08.887 --> 18:10.421
I appreciate you, too.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.924
Th-that's why I've been leaving
messages with herb for days.

18:12.926 --> 18:14.158
What?!

18:14.160 --> 18:15.393
You haven't gotten them?

18:18.263 --> 18:20.264
Herb...
I'm sorry.

18:20.266 --> 18:21.966
I just wanted a friend.

18:21.968 --> 18:24.836
You know, one who
wasn't trapped in a mirror.

18:26.472 --> 18:28.306
Oh, herb.

18:28.308 --> 18:29.640
I brought you something.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.275
You did?

18:31.277 --> 18:34.278
You don't happen to
have a toaster, do you?

18:34.280 --> 18:35.847
I have a toaster.

18:35.849 --> 18:39.050
I also have a...
A guest room with
a king-size bed

18:39.052 --> 18:41.385
And a new 42-inch
flat-screen tv.

18:41.387 --> 18:42.453
There's no tv in there.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.055
There <i>could</i> be.

18:44.057 --> 18:46.724
Really?

18:46.726 --> 18:48.659
Your turn.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.962
I'm not gonna
try to buy you.

18:50.964 --> 18:53.231
I mean, you're either
my friend or you're not.

18:53.233 --> 18:55.967
I have no such qualms--
I'll throw in a blu-ray player.

18:55.969 --> 18:58.469
Wow.
Okay, all right,
I'm out of here.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.104
No, no, wait, wait, wait.

19:00.106 --> 19:02.840
(sighs)
herb...

19:02.842 --> 19:06.244
I-I can't thank you enough
for taking me in,

19:06.246 --> 19:07.845
But...

19:07.847 --> 19:09.480
As you can see...

19:09.482 --> 19:11.315
Walden needs me.

19:11.317 --> 19:13.618
I wouldn't
go that far.
Shh...

19:14.953 --> 19:17.588
Let me, uh,
let me get my things.

19:20.125 --> 19:21.759
(sighs)

19:21.761 --> 19:24.495
What is it
about that little guy?

19:24.497 --> 19:27.398
What is it about us
that we're fighting over him?

19:34.239 --> 19:36.307
