00:12.344 --> 00:15.413
[indistinct chatter]

00:16.965 --> 00:17.965
- What are you looking at?

00:18.034 --> 00:19.344
- Noticed you don't
have a rank.

00:19.413 --> 00:21.137
- How long have you been
over here?

00:21.206 --> 00:23.206
- Seven months.
- Seven?

00:23.275 --> 00:24.931
After six, you automatically
get a stripe.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.068
- Something's not right.

00:27.137 --> 00:29.103
- No one's ever
contacted me about that.

00:29.172 --> 00:31.172
- It's your job
to contact them.

00:31.241 --> 00:33.758
You need to fix this.
- How?

00:33.827 --> 00:35.965
- Go to Colonel Austin
and ask for that stripe.

00:36.034 --> 00:37.827
- Colonel Austin?

00:37.896 --> 00:39.689
- It's the only way
to get this straightened out.

00:39.758 --> 00:42.310
- Ah, he's pretty busy.
- Yeah.

00:42.379 --> 00:44.620
Pretty busy
with stuff like this.

00:45.758 --> 00:47.344
- [sighs]
Man.

00:47.413 --> 00:50.896
[mechanical clanking]

00:50.965 --> 00:52.379
- Don't mean to bother
you guys.

00:52.448 --> 00:53.689
- Davis.

00:53.758 --> 00:54.862
- Didn't expect to see
you here so soon.

00:54.931 --> 00:56.241
- Yeah. I know
I'm not officially

00:56.310 --> 00:57.310
a part of the team yet,

00:57.379 --> 01:00.379
but I just wanted
to ask a few...

01:02.448 --> 01:04.758
Y'all got a sick setup
on this base.

01:04.827 --> 01:06.724
It's like a whole nother
world over here.

01:06.793 --> 01:09.034
Gonna be kinda hard to go back
to the other side.

01:09.103 --> 01:10.413
Nice.

01:10.482 --> 01:12.034
- Yeah, what can we do
for you, Davis?

01:12.103 --> 01:13.724
- Just got a few questions.

01:13.793 --> 01:15.896
How long does it take
for the checks to arrive?

01:15.965 --> 01:17.172
I mean, is it, like,
a long wait?

01:17.241 --> 01:19.000
- Nah, nah,
nothing like that, mate.

01:19.068 --> 01:20.241
- Checks always come.

01:20.310 --> 01:21.758
We even set up
direct deposit for you.

01:21.827 --> 01:22.758
- Good to know.

01:26.965 --> 01:28.172
Sweet.

01:28.241 --> 01:30.793
[applause]

01:30.862 --> 01:32.034
- Nice shot, mate.

01:32.862 --> 01:34.965
- Is there anything else
we can help you with?

01:35.034 --> 01:37.206
- Yes, there is.

01:39.206 --> 01:42.206
Why you guys here?
And what's SecCorp up to?

01:42.275 --> 01:44.517
- [exhales]
Well, until you're officially

01:44.586 --> 01:48.241
wearing one of our black vests,
that's none of your business.

01:49.586 --> 01:51.758
Take a swing.

01:51.827 --> 01:53.517
- Don't mind if I do.

01:58.586 --> 02:01.793
- Remember.
Bend the knees.

02:04.517 --> 02:06.862
[audience groans]
- [sighs]

02:06.931 --> 02:08.551
- Yeah, this is not my sport.

02:08.620 --> 02:10.517
- Eh, you'll get
the hang of it.

02:10.586 --> 02:12.413
- That's what I'm afraid of.

02:15.206 --> 02:16.103
[door clicks shut]

02:16.172 --> 02:18.206
[sighs]

02:18.275 --> 02:21.482
[indistinct chatter]

02:21.551 --> 02:23.758
- I see you, Davis.
I see you.

02:23.827 --> 02:26.517
- Look, you gotta understand--
- It's genius.

02:26.586 --> 02:28.379
- It is?
- Yeah. You're our inside man.

02:28.448 --> 02:30.413
It's a coy ploy.
Sneak in there,

02:30.482 --> 02:31.931
earn their trust,
gather evidence

02:32.000 --> 02:33.310
on Sasquatch's war crimes,

02:33.379 --> 02:35.034
then stab them
while they sleep.

02:35.103 --> 02:37.275
I like your style.
What's the plan?

02:38.655 --> 02:40.482
- You ready for the plan?
- Yeah, lay it on me.

02:41.724 --> 02:44.137
- The plan is,
They write me checks.

02:44.206 --> 02:46.379
- Okay.
- I cash those checks.

02:46.448 --> 02:49.724
I help get my mom healthy
again, save my home.

02:49.793 --> 02:51.000
That's the plan.

02:51.068 --> 02:52.413
- The plan doesn't include me.

02:52.482 --> 02:55.034
- That's exactly what makes it
an excellent plan.

02:55.103 --> 02:56.379
Plans that include you

02:56.448 --> 02:57.965
generally end with someone
losing everything

02:58.034 --> 03:01.689
they hoped to gain,
sometimes their life.

03:02.344 --> 03:05.206
- Medevac, medevac, medevac.
9-line follows. Over.

03:05.275 --> 03:07.413
- Send it over.

03:08.793 --> 03:11.413
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Let's roll!

03:13.517 --> 03:15.620
[helicopter rotors whirring]

03:15.689 --> 03:18.448
[indistinct radio chatter]

03:18.517 --> 03:20.689
- We're coming to get you.
Just sit tight.

03:29.655 --> 03:32.586
- Joining the Death Star
just for the goddamn money.

03:32.655 --> 03:34.379
- Just for the goddamn money.

03:34.448 --> 03:35.724
- This is not the man I know.

03:35.793 --> 03:38.068
- The man you know
got bills to pay.

03:38.137 --> 03:39.724
- Not like this.
- Just like this.

03:39.793 --> 03:42.620
- Look, I understand
there's some personal shit

03:42.689 --> 03:44.275
happening between you two,

03:44.344 --> 03:46.517
but we leave it off
the battlefield.

03:46.586 --> 03:49.655
- She's right! Y'all need
to work out your shit,

03:49.724 --> 03:51.517
because we're approaching
the AO!

03:51.586 --> 03:53.655
both: Just land
this fucking thing!

03:57.827 --> 03:59.586
[door creaks]

03:59.655 --> 04:02.275
- Is it just me, or is everyone
beginning to trust

04:02.344 --> 04:04.000
our little operation here?

04:04.068 --> 04:06.068
- Yes, this is very good news.

04:06.137 --> 04:08.517
What is not very good news
is that most of them are having

04:08.586 --> 04:10.551
aggressive diarrhea
in an area of our country

04:10.620 --> 04:12.724
not known
for its indoor plumbing.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.068
[person coughs]

04:16.137 --> 04:18.068
- All of them are having
this same issue?

04:18.137 --> 04:21.206
- No, some of them are also
having internal bleeding.

04:21.275 --> 04:25.000
Others are old and have become
so sick, they are near death.

04:25.068 --> 04:26.689
And I think I know why.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.586
[pump squeaks]

04:29.655 --> 04:32.758
[indistinct chatter]

04:35.413 --> 04:36.965
- [sniffs]
Ugh.

04:37.034 --> 04:38.758
[chicken clucking]

04:40.827 --> 04:43.344
[spits]

04:43.413 --> 04:45.137
It's totally contaminated.

04:45.206 --> 04:46.413
- That was my assessment.

04:46.482 --> 04:47.758
- How long has this
been happening?

04:47.827 --> 04:49.758
- Since the Americans
started whatever it is

04:49.827 --> 04:52.068
they are doing across the hill.
- Americans?

04:52.137 --> 04:54.931
- The ones with the black vests
and the beards.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.379
- SecCorp?

04:56.448 --> 04:58.379
- We do not differentiate.
Some here claim to have

04:58.448 --> 05:01.034
seen them come late at nights
to pour liquids into the wells.

05:01.103 --> 05:02.551
- Well, what kind of liquids?

05:02.620 --> 05:04.275
- They do not know.

05:04.344 --> 05:05.689
- We have to do something
about this.

05:05.758 --> 05:08.241
- Yes, I was hoping
you would have more options

05:08.310 --> 05:10.206
at your disposal than I do.

05:10.275 --> 05:11.413
- Yeah, well,
we can at least try

05:11.482 --> 05:13.862
and get clean water in here,
for starters.

05:13.931 --> 05:16.551
- People of this village
would be very appreciative.

05:16.620 --> 05:19.379
- That's why we're here
in Afghanistan, Qasem.

05:19.448 --> 05:22.000
- I was hoping
there was a reason.

05:23.448 --> 05:26.000
- I'm not having this argument
with you anymore.

05:26.068 --> 05:27.068
- You are over me.

05:28.448 --> 05:30.620
- No, I'm not.

05:30.689 --> 05:32.379
And that's another problem
I have to solve.

05:32.448 --> 05:35.379
But for now,
we'll solve this one first.

05:51.172 --> 05:53.931
- Sir, what's the situation?

05:54.000 --> 05:55.620
- We got called in
to clear this minefield

05:55.689 --> 05:58.103
the Soviets so graciously
left behind in the '80s.

05:58.172 --> 06:00.448
Sergeant Decker was defusing
an ordnance when it exploded.

06:00.517 --> 06:01.793
Shot her up 20 feet in the air.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.758
- Signs of life?
- We're not sure.

06:03.827 --> 06:05.517
We're praying her suit
gave her some protection.

06:06.620 --> 06:07.965
- What are we looking at here?

06:08.034 --> 06:09.758
- The orange flags
are the mines we can see.

06:09.827 --> 06:10.931
Blue are the path
that we're making.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.379
But we don't know
what we don't know,

06:12.448 --> 06:14.344
so I can't recommend
that you walk out there

06:14.413 --> 06:15.689
until we chart a path.

06:15.758 --> 06:17.482
- We don't have
that kind of time.

06:17.551 --> 06:19.241
The fastest way in and out
is to hover the bird over her

06:19.310 --> 06:21.068
so we can lower the basket
and pluck her out.

06:21.137 --> 06:22.827
- You couldn't get the bird
in low enough.

06:22.896 --> 06:24.413
The rotor wash from the blades.

06:24.482 --> 06:26.448
Get too close,
and the vibrations

06:26.517 --> 06:28.620
will disturb
any unexploded ordnance.

06:28.689 --> 06:30.000
Gotta be by foot.

06:30.068 --> 06:31.655
- How did she get out there?
- Muffin.

06:31.724 --> 06:33.517
- Who's Muffin?
- Bomb-sniffing canine.

06:33.586 --> 06:35.310
The dog finds a path,

06:35.379 --> 06:36.379
Decker follows the dog.

06:36.448 --> 06:37.931
- Somebody call the dog.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.586
- We tried that, but that dog's
not leaving Decker's side.

06:41.655 --> 06:43.413
- Muffin!
[dog panting]

06:43.482 --> 06:44.862
Come here!

06:44.931 --> 06:47.344
- Muffin speaks German.
- German?

06:47.413 --> 06:48.275
- It's the language
they're trained in

06:48.344 --> 06:50.310
for security reasons.

06:50.379 --> 06:53.379
- If you have move that slow
and we have to learn German,

06:53.448 --> 06:54.862
then our wounded's not
gonna make it.

06:54.931 --> 06:56.758
- Yeah, well, as you can see,
we're doing our best.

06:56.827 --> 06:58.517
Maybe you could think
of something else.

06:58.586 --> 07:00.241
But while you do that,
we're gonna continue plotting

07:00.310 --> 07:01.862
a safe way to get out there.

07:02.655 --> 07:04.965
- So all we gotta do is walk
across this unmarked

07:05.034 --> 07:07.724
40-year-old minefield,
then lug a wounded EOD

07:07.793 --> 07:10.448
in a 300-pound bomb suit
back across

07:10.517 --> 07:12.034
without her bleeding out?

07:16.965 --> 07:21.000
- [speaking German]
Muffin.

07:21.068 --> 07:23.931
- [speaking German]
- [speaking German] Muffin!

07:24.000 --> 07:25.551
- Can one of you translate
to Muffin that we're trying

07:25.620 --> 07:26.931
to save its master's life?
- [whistles]

07:27.000 --> 07:28.758
- The dog knows
random German commands.

07:28.827 --> 07:31.103
Doesn't speak it
conversationally.

07:31.172 --> 07:32.965
- Gotta figure out a way
to get that dog over here.

07:33.034 --> 07:34.482
Fuck's sake.

07:36.793 --> 07:39.000
- That dog can sniff bombs
underground,

07:39.068 --> 07:43.103
then he sure as shit could
sniff food across a minefield.

07:45.413 --> 07:46.896
Come here, Muffin!

07:46.965 --> 07:48.793
[dog whines]
- He speaks German.

07:48.862 --> 07:50.448
- He speaks hungry.
Come here, boy!

07:50.517 --> 07:52.379
- [whistles]
- Come here, Muffin!

07:52.448 --> 07:53.586
- [whistles]

07:53.655 --> 07:55.000
- Oh, hey, look, look,
look, look.

07:55.068 --> 07:56.655
- [whistles]
- Yeah, yeah, whoo!

07:56.724 --> 07:57.862
- Come here, boy!

07:57.931 --> 07:58.931
- Hey.
- Good boy.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.655
- Oh, shit.
[chuckles]

08:00.724 --> 08:02.172
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah!

08:02.241 --> 08:04.724
Whoo! Oh, yeah.
- Come here, Muffin.

08:04.793 --> 08:06.275
- Yeah.
- Come here, Muffin.

08:06.344 --> 08:08.655
- Yes!
- Yeah.

08:08.724 --> 08:10.655
Good boy.
- [chuckles]

08:10.724 --> 08:13.206
See?
What happens now?

08:13.275 --> 08:15.413
- My partner and I follow
the dog out to Sergeant Decker.

08:15.482 --> 08:16.793
- And then what?

08:16.862 --> 08:17.793
- Try and figure out a way
to get her to safety.

08:17.862 --> 08:19.241
- Yeah, you're a good dog.

08:19.310 --> 08:21.103
- [sighs]
No.

08:21.172 --> 08:22.827
Is that dog really good
at sniffing bombs?

08:22.896 --> 08:24.448
- She's the best there is.

08:24.517 --> 08:26.793
- Then we'll follow her out
to Sergeant Decker.

08:26.862 --> 08:28.137
She's gonna need
immediate medical attention

08:28.206 --> 08:30.724
before she can be moved.
That's sorta why we're here.

08:30.793 --> 08:32.896
- Whoa, that's high-risk.
Definitely not protocol.

08:32.965 --> 08:34.758
- It is now.
- Hey.

08:34.827 --> 08:37.068
- Okay, one of you
follow me out.

08:37.137 --> 08:39.413
[dog panting]

08:39.482 --> 08:40.655
- [sighs]

08:40.724 --> 08:42.965
- Two out of three?
- I'm good.

08:43.034 --> 08:44.068
- Here.

08:44.137 --> 08:46.586
Leave a trail with these.
- [sighs]

08:46.655 --> 08:48.068
[dog panting]

08:48.137 --> 08:49.965
- [breathes shakily]
Oh, shit.

08:50.034 --> 08:52.517
Oh, shit.

08:52.586 --> 08:54.206
[exhales shakily]

08:57.310 --> 09:00.689
- [breathes shakily]

09:00.758 --> 09:02.172
- Come on.

09:02.241 --> 09:04.862
[bird calling]

09:09.517 --> 09:11.862
[bird cawing]

09:22.275 --> 09:23.275
[dog barks]

09:23.344 --> 09:24.551
- What's it doing?

09:24.620 --> 09:26.482
- I don't know.
He must have smelled something.

09:26.551 --> 09:29.000
Good dog.
[chuckles]

09:31.965 --> 09:34.103
- We get out of here alive,

09:34.172 --> 09:36.448
I'm gonna buy that
motherfucking dog a drink.

09:36.517 --> 09:37.689
[dog growls]

09:37.758 --> 09:39.620
- Oh, shit.

09:48.620 --> 09:50.379
[dog sniffs]

09:50.448 --> 09:51.793
Good boy.

09:51.862 --> 09:52.862
You know, you could learn
a thing or two

09:52.931 --> 09:54.482
about loyalty
from this dog.

09:54.551 --> 09:57.206
- Loyalty to who?
You?

09:57.275 --> 09:58.620
- Look, I get it.

09:58.689 --> 10:00.103
Trust is the bedrock
of all friendship,

10:00.172 --> 10:01.620
and I broke your trust,
but just give me another chance

10:01.689 --> 10:03.241
to help you out.

10:04.827 --> 10:06.655
- No more chances.
Time's up.

10:06.724 --> 10:08.275
We're out here on our own now.

10:08.344 --> 10:10.517
- If that's really how you
feel, that's just fucking sad,

10:10.586 --> 10:14.034
'cause you and I are family.
- No, I have a real family.

10:14.103 --> 10:15.862
One that I would
do anything to save.

10:15.931 --> 10:18.724
I'd cut off my arm for them.
Sell my soul.

10:18.793 --> 10:20.068
- Look, I get that,
but those SecCorp guys

10:20.137 --> 10:21.793
have got fucking blood
on their hands, Davis.

10:21.862 --> 10:23.551
Buckley's blood.
- You can't prove that.

10:23.620 --> 10:25.689
- Hey! Both of you!

10:25.758 --> 10:29.206
Do not talk!
Do not step on mines!

10:29.275 --> 10:30.551
Be like Muffin!

10:30.620 --> 10:32.551
- Stay away
from the orange flags!

10:32.620 --> 10:35.275
- No shit!
I'm following the dog!

10:37.000 --> 10:40.344
- The dog is man's best friend,
we're following the dog.

10:44.172 --> 10:45.310
[dog barks]

10:47.310 --> 10:48.724
- Okay.

10:48.793 --> 10:51.310
[electronic tone]

10:56.724 --> 10:59.172
Oh, good boy.
Good boy.

10:59.241 --> 11:01.655
[dog squeals]

11:01.724 --> 11:02.827
Good dog, that's it.

11:06.034 --> 11:08.310
- Good job.
- She's alive!

11:09.965 --> 11:11.896
Pulse is weak.

11:13.793 --> 11:14.896
- Blood pressure's low.

11:14.965 --> 11:16.275
She's in shock.

11:16.344 --> 11:17.965
- Bleeding from the mouth,
possible internal injuries.

11:18.034 --> 11:19.586
Can you hear me?
- [stammers]

11:19.655 --> 11:21.310
I can't move anything.

11:21.379 --> 11:23.103
- Okay, probable spinal damage.
- Yeah.

11:23.172 --> 11:24.379
- Concussion. We're not gonna
be able to get her out

11:24.448 --> 11:26.172
of this suit.
- Get me out of here.

11:26.241 --> 11:28.724
- Gonna get you home, okay?
We need an evac!

11:28.793 --> 11:29.793
- Get her out of there!

11:29.862 --> 11:30.896
The dog will lead you back out.

11:30.965 --> 11:32.275
- This fucking guy.

11:32.344 --> 11:33.965
- They can't carry her out
with a broken back.

11:34.034 --> 11:35.655
They'd risk paralyzing her.

11:35.724 --> 11:37.000
- Look, get back in the bird,

11:37.068 --> 11:39.551
lower the basket so we can
get her out of here!

11:39.620 --> 11:40.793
All right, okay.

11:40.862 --> 11:42.310
I need you to stay awake
for us now, okay?

11:47.896 --> 11:50.862
[airplane engine humming]

11:53.275 --> 11:55.620
- Whatever SecCorp is doing
is contaminating

11:55.689 --> 11:56.862
the villagers' drinking water.

11:56.931 --> 11:59.379
Now, they need fresh water.

11:59.448 --> 12:02.034
I know what I'm asking, and I
understand that no one upstairs

12:02.103 --> 12:04.689
wants to waste resources
on the local population,

12:04.758 --> 12:07.241
but the longer we wait,
the worse it'll get.

12:07.310 --> 12:08.827
- We can supply the water.

12:10.482 --> 12:11.724
- Really?

12:11.793 --> 12:13.793
- You heard me.

12:13.862 --> 12:16.379
- You're not gonna push back?

12:16.448 --> 12:18.586
You're not gonna give me
18 reasons why this should

12:18.655 --> 12:20.689
have no operational priority?

12:20.758 --> 12:22.724
- I will if you want me to.
- No.

12:22.793 --> 12:26.034
I'm happy to take yes
for an answer.

12:26.103 --> 12:30.068
- Anything else?
- Um, no.

12:30.137 --> 12:31.448
Thank you.

12:31.517 --> 12:33.137
- Sonia.

12:33.206 --> 12:34.862
Whatever you need to help
and support the poor people

12:34.931 --> 12:37.068
of this village,
you just say the word.

12:38.793 --> 12:41.862
- May I ask why you're so eager
to help me with this, sir?

12:41.931 --> 12:44.310
- Sometimes you just gotta
do what's right.

12:44.379 --> 12:46.310
- [laughs]

12:51.620 --> 12:52.827
- Corporal!

12:52.896 --> 12:54.241
Get that asshole
Morgan Jennings in here

12:54.310 --> 12:55.551
right away, please.

12:55.620 --> 12:57.103
- Yes, sir.

13:00.206 --> 13:01.137
- [sighs]

13:01.206 --> 13:03.862
[helicopter rotors whirring]

13:07.068 --> 13:08.103
- Lower.

13:09.862 --> 13:12.448
- We're at 300 feet.
- Lower!

13:16.344 --> 13:18.206
- 250!

13:18.275 --> 13:20.965
200!
I'm not going any lower!

13:21.034 --> 13:23.413
That's all the slack we got
to lower the basket.

13:23.482 --> 13:25.482
- Shit.
- What now?

13:25.551 --> 13:26.931
- Is that all the slack
you got?

13:27.000 --> 13:29.413
- Affirmative.
- Then bring the bird lower!

13:29.482 --> 13:31.862
- We do not recommend
you go lower!

13:31.931 --> 13:33.344
- Maybe we ought
to listen to them.

13:33.413 --> 13:34.827
- Ah.

13:34.896 --> 13:36.620
- We're gonna get you
out of here, okay?

13:37.344 --> 13:40.344
Our patient is critical.
We gotta move it!

13:40.413 --> 13:42.137
- Fuck.

13:44.620 --> 13:47.103
Go lower! Slowly!

13:47.172 --> 13:49.344
- Bring it down!
- Don't do it!

13:49.413 --> 13:52.379
- I'm getting signals from EOD
that if I lower the bird,

13:52.448 --> 13:54.655
we all die
in a large explosion!

13:54.724 --> 13:56.206
- What the fuck
are you waiting for?

13:56.275 --> 13:59.000
- Our patient is critical!
Lower the fucking bird!

13:59.068 --> 14:01.310
- Put it down!
- God damn it!

14:07.758 --> 14:10.793
[ground rumbling]

14:11.620 --> 14:13.000
- It's fine, right?

14:14.827 --> 14:16.413
- It's definitely fine.

14:19.689 --> 14:22.413
- Stop! Stop!

14:22.482 --> 14:24.379
- Hold!
- Hold!

14:27.068 --> 14:30.551
- Where you at?
- Maybe 150 above you!

14:32.344 --> 14:34.482
- What do you think?
- Don't do it!

14:34.551 --> 14:36.965
Any lower, you're gonna
detonate something!

14:38.448 --> 14:40.413
- What do you think?

14:40.482 --> 14:42.344
Yeah, me too.

14:42.413 --> 14:43.379
Bring it down!

14:45.413 --> 14:46.517
- Bring it down!

14:52.965 --> 14:56.034
[rumbling continues]

14:58.310 --> 15:00.206
- What the fuck
are you doing?

15:04.241 --> 15:05.758
- Shit, shit, shit, shit!
- Motherfucker!

15:05.827 --> 15:07.379
- Holy fuck!

15:13.482 --> 15:15.517
- [panting]

15:15.586 --> 15:16.620
- [laughs]

15:17.965 --> 15:19.344
Holy shit!

15:20.620 --> 15:21.862
- Too close for me!

15:21.931 --> 15:23.413
Need to get us
to a safer ceiling!

15:23.482 --> 15:26.620
- Give us 15 seconds!
We're pulling out!

15:26.689 --> 15:28.103
Put her on the stretcher now!

15:30.137 --> 15:32.931
- One, two, three, roll!

15:39.275 --> 15:40.172
- Down!

15:44.724 --> 15:46.586
- Now! We gotta go now!

15:46.655 --> 15:48.413
- You're good!

16:03.620 --> 16:05.000
- We're gone!

16:11.517 --> 16:12.965
- Fuck.

16:13.034 --> 16:14.655
- What?

16:14.724 --> 16:17.689
- How we get out of here?
- We follow the flags.

16:17.758 --> 16:19.000
- What flags?

16:23.862 --> 16:25.206
[sighs]
- What do we do now?

16:25.275 --> 16:26.655
- We don't move a fucking inch.

16:31.758 --> 16:34.620
[metal detector beeping]

16:37.137 --> 16:40.137
- This is one fucked-up way
to earn a living.

16:40.206 --> 16:41.827
- Money's not really
why we do it though, is it?

16:41.896 --> 16:43.482
- Speak for yourself.

16:45.310 --> 16:46.896
- Come on, man,
I'm begging you.

16:46.965 --> 16:48.689
Don't sell your soul
for six magic beans.

16:48.758 --> 16:51.344
- It ain't magic beans.
It's 100 grand.

16:51.413 --> 16:53.103
And that's just
the signing bonus.

16:55.724 --> 16:58.620
- Rather get blown up
by one of those land mines.

16:58.689 --> 17:00.931
- That can be arranged.

17:01.655 --> 17:03.379
- My mom and sisters are never
gonna see me dolled up

17:03.448 --> 17:05.103
in those Darth Vader
fucking black vests--

17:05.172 --> 17:07.000
- Drop it.

17:08.689 --> 17:10.413
- Can't imagine telling them
that I'm like a soulless

17:10.482 --> 17:11.689
mercenary who just kills
for money...

17:11.758 --> 17:13.689
- I'm warning you.
- Or protect some fucking

17:13.758 --> 17:16.068
fascist dictator who just
slaughters his own people

17:16.137 --> 17:17.620
just to stay in power.
They do that, you know.

17:17.689 --> 17:19.172
- So do we.

17:20.620 --> 17:22.586
- Look, just trust that you
and I can find another way.

17:23.724 --> 17:25.448
- I found a way.

17:25.517 --> 17:27.034
Hey, guys!

17:27.103 --> 17:28.551
How long's it gonna take
out there?

17:28.620 --> 17:30.379
We gonna make it home
by Christmas?

17:30.448 --> 17:32.689
- Gonna be at least
another couple hours!

17:32.758 --> 17:35.275
- So no.
No is the answer.

17:35.344 --> 17:37.448
[metal detector beeping]

17:37.517 --> 17:40.068
[both sigh]

17:40.137 --> 17:42.275
Main, this is
Dustoff 3-1 Delta.

17:42.344 --> 17:43.620
- Go ahead, Delta.

17:43.689 --> 17:45.620
- Yeah, just wondering
when that bird's gonna

17:45.689 --> 17:47.310
pick our asses up
and get us out of this

17:47.379 --> 17:49.344
Soviet fucking minefield.

17:49.413 --> 17:52.793
- Uh, roger, Delta.
Just hold tight.

17:52.862 --> 17:54.862
- Hey.

17:54.931 --> 17:56.344
It's okay
for Alvarez and Crash

17:56.413 --> 17:58.551
to risk their lives
for an EOD,

17:58.620 --> 18:00.586
but I'm not gonna put them
in danger just because of us.

18:00.655 --> 18:03.482
If that land mine had blown up
while they were hovering,

18:03.551 --> 18:04.896
the vibrations would've
seized up the rotors

18:04.965 --> 18:05.862
and they would've crashed.

18:05.931 --> 18:07.034
- [grunts]

18:09.137 --> 18:11.206
[sighs]

18:11.275 --> 18:12.275
Main, this is Delta.

18:12.344 --> 18:14.344
- Go ahead, Delta.

18:14.413 --> 18:16.379
- We're safe and out of danger.

18:16.448 --> 18:19.137
Just gonna hitch a ride
back to base with EOD.

18:19.206 --> 18:20.620
- Roger that.

18:20.689 --> 18:23.206
- [sighs]

18:23.275 --> 18:25.586
Our options are dwindling.

18:32.551 --> 18:34.206
- Incoming!

18:34.275 --> 18:35.517
- Sitrep!

18:35.586 --> 18:37.241
- Possible concussion,
internal bleeding.

18:37.310 --> 18:38.448
Pulse and heart rate are at 50.

18:38.517 --> 18:40.310
- Why is she still
in this thing?

18:40.379 --> 18:42.103
- Couldn't risk
taking it off her, sir.

18:42.172 --> 18:43.793
Also a good chance
there's spinal damage.

18:43.862 --> 18:45.137
- Well, someone cut her
out of the bloody suit.

18:45.206 --> 18:47.000
- How, Captain?
- Very fucking carefully.

18:47.068 --> 18:49.000
Alvarez!
- Gotta go, sir!

18:49.862 --> 18:52.620
- All right, get me three bags
of O negative, stat.

18:53.827 --> 18:55.551
- Hey, let's go get
Roback and Davis.

18:55.620 --> 18:57.862
- Relax. They just radioed in.
They're safe.

18:57.931 --> 18:59.172
They're out of the minefield

18:59.241 --> 19:00.655
and they're hitching a ride
back with EOD.

19:00.724 --> 19:02.068
- Oh, thank God.

19:02.137 --> 19:03.758
- Yup.

19:05.310 --> 19:06.517
[door clicks open]

19:10.413 --> 19:12.586
- Colonel wanted to see me?
- Have a seat.

19:12.655 --> 19:14.172
- I'll stand.

19:16.724 --> 19:18.689
- [clears throat]

19:20.448 --> 19:22.103
He's here, sir.

19:22.172 --> 19:24.137
- Make him wait.
- My pleasure.

19:24.206 --> 19:25.413
- Nah.

19:25.482 --> 19:27.931
On second thought,
let's get this over with.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.896
Jennings!

19:34.344 --> 19:36.896
- How can I be of service,
Colonel?

19:38.413 --> 19:40.517
- We have a growing
humanitarian problem

19:40.586 --> 19:43.068
at the local village.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

19:43.137 --> 19:44.413
What's it got to do with us?

19:44.482 --> 19:46.827
- I believe you folks
are familiar with the area.

19:46.896 --> 19:49.965
- Yeah, yes, we are.
Um, and, you know,

19:50.034 --> 19:51.793
my heart just goes out
to those poor people,

19:51.862 --> 19:55.931
but, uh, I'm just not sure
how I can help, though.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.896
- Oh, you can't.

19:57.965 --> 20:00.413
I just wanted to put on your
radar that it's now on mine.

20:02.896 --> 20:05.655
- [laughs]

20:05.724 --> 20:09.172
Uh, you know, um...

20:09.241 --> 20:13.344
if the problem is as bad
as you say it is,

20:13.413 --> 20:16.931
would it not be better
to have the, uh, U.S. Army

20:17.000 --> 20:19.586
help move these people to a,

20:19.655 --> 20:22.275
you know, more
health-positive location?

20:22.344 --> 20:24.034
I mean, we'd obviously help,
if--if we could,

20:24.103 --> 20:25.689
but we don't have
your resources.

20:25.758 --> 20:27.724
- Mm.

20:27.793 --> 20:29.862
Relocation would cause
headache after headache.

20:29.931 --> 20:31.310
- Mm-hmm.

20:31.379 --> 20:32.689
- But clean water,

20:32.758 --> 20:35.310
that, we can provide
as long as they need it.

20:35.379 --> 20:37.172
And then we'll bring in
the Army Corps of Engineers

20:37.241 --> 20:40.655
to find out what could possibly
be contaminating their wells.

20:42.137 --> 20:44.379
Whatever they find should be
interesting, to say the least.

20:47.137 --> 20:49.551
- I'm sorry I can't
be more help.

20:51.344 --> 20:55.482
But, you know, I applaud your
kind heart and generous spirit.

20:55.551 --> 20:56.689
- Mm.

21:08.931 --> 21:10.689
- How'd that go, sir?

21:10.758 --> 21:12.413
- Oh, I got that
son of a bitch's attention.

21:12.482 --> 21:14.655
- Good work, sir.
- Mm.

21:23.172 --> 21:25.758
- Hungry?
- No.

21:25.827 --> 21:27.724
- Come on, man.
It's gonna be hours

21:27.793 --> 21:29.000
before EOD plots a path.

21:29.068 --> 21:31.413
Just...share a meal with me.

21:31.482 --> 21:33.482
- I said I'm not hungry.

21:33.551 --> 21:35.689
- Break bread with me,
for fuck's sake.

21:35.758 --> 21:38.896
We could die. It's ravioli!
- I said no!

21:38.965 --> 21:42.275
[explosion]

21:42.344 --> 21:44.103
- You fucking lunatics!

21:44.172 --> 21:45.724
- Fuck, man.

21:52.827 --> 21:55.103
- You good?

21:55.172 --> 21:56.896
- Yeah.

21:56.965 --> 21:58.482
- [sighs]

21:58.551 --> 22:00.517
You know how many people get
shot out here in these hills?

22:00.586 --> 22:03.275
Taliban patrols these
fucking places after night.

22:03.344 --> 22:04.206
We gotta get the fuck
out of here.

22:04.275 --> 22:06.241
- No shit.

22:14.586 --> 22:16.655
- I'm here to see the colonel
about getting my stripe.

22:16.724 --> 22:18.275
I've been here
for seven months,

22:18.344 --> 22:20.206
and after six months,
you are...

22:20.275 --> 22:22.034
- You wanna talk
to Colonel Austin

22:22.103 --> 22:23.379
about your one stripe?

22:23.448 --> 22:26.206
- Uh, m-my buddies said
he was the guy.

22:27.344 --> 22:29.344
- Your buddies?
- Yeah. He--

22:29.413 --> 22:31.413
[door clicks open]
Sir!

22:33.827 --> 22:35.862
- Private?

22:35.931 --> 22:37.758
The fuck you doing in here?

22:39.862 --> 22:42.896
- Sir, he's here to help me
with some things.

22:42.965 --> 22:44.655
- Uh-huh.

22:47.896 --> 22:49.551
- What?

22:50.827 --> 22:53.275
Well, I just blew
my chance with the colonel.

22:53.344 --> 22:54.620
- J--wait.

22:54.689 --> 22:56.862
Look, let me see
if I can help you.

22:56.931 --> 23:00.206
Come over here and we'll take
a peek at your personnel file.

23:02.965 --> 23:04.793
[sighs]

23:04.862 --> 23:06.517
Stealing an ambulance.

23:06.586 --> 23:08.137
- I mean, I signed it out
under my name, but--

23:08.206 --> 23:09.793
- Unauthorized leave of base.

23:09.862 --> 23:12.310
- That was, uh,
community outreach.

23:12.379 --> 23:14.034
- Harboring livestock.

23:14.103 --> 23:15.724
- Boz.
- Wow.

23:15.793 --> 23:17.655
I can see why you haven't moved
a rank in seven months.

23:21.344 --> 23:24.000
- Look, I--
look, you don't understand.

23:24.068 --> 23:26.586
I just bought a car that I
can't come close to affording.

23:26.655 --> 23:29.103
I really need a pay raise.

23:29.172 --> 23:30.724
- [scoffs]

23:30.793 --> 23:33.206
You know, I bought one of those
cars in my first tour too.

23:33.275 --> 23:35.000
Never drove it.
Sitting in my garage

23:35.068 --> 23:37.551
covered in a tarp,
and I'm still paying it off.

23:37.620 --> 23:39.586
- You are?
- Yeah. But I don't care.

23:39.655 --> 23:41.034
Because when I get out of here,

23:41.103 --> 23:42.413
I'm gonna throw everything
I own in the back seat,

23:42.482 --> 23:44.000
step on the gas,
and not look back.

23:44.068 --> 23:45.655
- [laughs]

23:45.724 --> 23:47.620
You know, that was
my secret plan too.

23:47.689 --> 23:49.172
[both laugh]

23:49.241 --> 23:51.137
- What's the big deal about
one stripe anyways, huh?

23:51.206 --> 23:54.241
I mean, everyone with an
asshole on this base has one.

23:54.310 --> 23:55.827
- Yeah.

23:55.896 --> 23:58.931
Anyway, uh,
thanks for trying to help.

24:05.517 --> 24:07.241
- We're sitting ducks
out here.

24:07.310 --> 24:11.793
We need to do something. Now.
- [sighs]

24:11.862 --> 24:14.655
I was hoping to avoid this,
but...

24:14.724 --> 24:16.448
- What the fuck are you doing?

24:16.517 --> 24:18.827
- Respect your perimeter!

24:18.896 --> 24:20.275
- Relax.

24:20.344 --> 24:21.827
I got a photographic memory.

24:21.896 --> 24:23.482
Got me through high school
without lifting a finger.

24:23.551 --> 24:25.310
I know exactly which way
the dog went.

24:26.482 --> 24:28.310
- Are you sure?
- Fairly sure.

24:28.379 --> 24:29.793
- How sure?

24:31.758 --> 24:33.413
- Like, 78%.

24:33.482 --> 24:35.896
- That's 22% unsure.

24:37.586 --> 24:38.965
- We gotta take those odds.

24:39.034 --> 24:40.827
- Stop!

24:40.896 --> 24:42.689
- What?

24:43.758 --> 24:46.413
- If you die,
I need to tell you.

24:46.482 --> 24:49.931
Whatever happens,
it's been real.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.793
- Thanks, man.

24:51.862 --> 24:53.241
- Don't you wanna say
the same thing back?

24:53.310 --> 24:55.275
- [grunts]

24:55.344 --> 24:57.689
Don't really feel like betting
against myself at the moment.

24:57.758 --> 25:00.965
- Right. I get that.
- Yeah.

25:03.103 --> 25:04.827
- Wait!
- What?

25:05.931 --> 25:07.206
- Coming with you.

25:07.275 --> 25:09.551
We're in this together,
for better or worse.

25:11.137 --> 25:13.241
- Just like old times.

25:13.310 --> 25:14.896
- We'll see.

25:17.172 --> 25:20.034
[both breathing shakily]

25:32.137 --> 25:33.965
What's wrong?

25:35.103 --> 25:37.655
- If we die...

25:37.724 --> 25:39.413
I don't wanna die mad at you.

25:41.586 --> 25:43.655
- I don't wanna die
mad at you either.

25:43.724 --> 25:46.448
- This SecCorp thing is fucking
hard for me to move past.

25:48.103 --> 25:50.896
- You should know it's hard
for me to move past too.

25:54.827 --> 25:56.137
- I forgive you.

25:56.206 --> 25:58.379
- I don't need your
motherfucking forgiveness.

26:02.206 --> 26:04.103
But thanks.

26:13.965 --> 26:15.103
[sighs]

26:32.896 --> 26:34.965
- That was fucking impressive.

26:39.344 --> 26:41.275
- Now that we're safe,

26:41.344 --> 26:43.482
fuck you for joining SecCorp.

26:43.551 --> 26:45.482
- Fuck you for not
understanding.

26:50.827 --> 26:52.034
[door clicks open]

26:53.620 --> 26:55.379
- There's more on the way.

26:55.448 --> 26:56.965
My superior officer assured me

26:57.034 --> 26:59.620
there'd be gallons of fresh
drinking water supplied

26:59.689 --> 27:02.241
as soon as logistically
possible.

27:02.310 --> 27:04.965
- Well, I'm grateful
for the fresh drinking water.

27:05.034 --> 27:09.000
- I hope that's what you
need to be...happy.

27:09.068 --> 27:11.620
- The water will
make me happy, yes.

27:11.689 --> 27:14.000
- Then that makes me
happy too.

27:14.068 --> 27:18.034
- We are not talking about
drinking water anymore, are we?

27:18.103 --> 27:20.137
- Might as well be.

27:20.206 --> 27:22.379
- What--
what is wrong?

27:22.448 --> 27:24.206
- [sighs]

27:30.758 --> 27:33.103
You know, I thought about
what it would be like

27:33.172 --> 27:35.655
if that medic never brought you
into my hospital.

27:36.448 --> 27:37.758
- And?

27:39.586 --> 27:43.241
- No matter what happens,
I'm so goddamn grateful he did.

27:50.931 --> 27:53.275
- Whoever is poisoning
our drinking water

27:53.344 --> 27:56.068
will not be happy that you're
interfering with their plans.

27:56.137 --> 27:58.758
- Yeah, well, I'm pretty sure
that's my commanding officer's

27:58.827 --> 28:01.310
whole goal here.
[laughs]

28:01.379 --> 28:05.068
- Even though I do not know
this man, I admire him.

28:05.137 --> 28:06.310
- You and me both.

28:13.482 --> 28:16.172
- I had a lot of time to think
on that minefield.

28:16.827 --> 28:19.137
If I'd have gotten blown up
out there,

28:19.206 --> 28:20.689
Alvarez would have
gotten her green card

28:20.758 --> 28:23.758
and been free and clear.

28:23.827 --> 28:25.689
- Comforting thought,
but you didn't get blown up.

28:25.758 --> 28:28.103
- Exactly.
So now

28:28.172 --> 28:29.793
her and I are gonna have
to go through the motions

28:29.862 --> 28:31.655
until this marriage
is deemed genuine.

28:33.241 --> 28:35.344
Plus, you promised yourself

28:35.413 --> 28:37.482
you don't wanna fuck
a married man.

28:37.551 --> 28:39.655
- I was extremely young.
- Still.

28:39.724 --> 28:42.137
While we're on base,

28:42.206 --> 28:43.689
Colonel Austin's gonna
make sure that

28:43.758 --> 28:45.758
this marriage is legit.

28:48.724 --> 28:51.965
- There is a plan buried
somewhere in all this, right?

28:52.034 --> 28:53.379
- There is.

28:53.448 --> 28:54.827
- What?

28:58.827 --> 29:01.620
- We do what's right.

29:01.689 --> 29:05.172
And what's right is knowing
that helping Alvarez

29:05.241 --> 29:08.103
is more important than
you and I being together.

29:10.068 --> 29:13.241
Doing what's right
is knowing that if...

29:13.310 --> 29:16.793
you and I are supposed
to be together,

29:16.862 --> 29:20.448
it'll happen someday.

29:20.517 --> 29:21.689
Right?

29:21.758 --> 29:23.758
- [exhales sharply]

29:23.827 --> 29:26.620
- No.
No, fuck it, no.

29:26.689 --> 29:29.103
- When did you get all
New Agey about this?

29:33.172 --> 29:34.586
- When I realized
it was my fate to walk out

29:34.655 --> 29:36.000
of a minefield alive.

29:37.724 --> 29:41.241
And it's our fate to...

29:41.310 --> 29:44.344
I don't know--

29:44.413 --> 29:47.862
sacrifice being together

29:47.931 --> 29:50.758
so we can both help somebody
that we really care about.

29:52.482 --> 29:54.379
- [scoffs]

29:54.448 --> 29:55.655
Jesus, Roback.

29:55.724 --> 29:58.655
- [sighs]
- [laughs]

30:00.965 --> 30:03.137
This is a new side of you.
- I know.

30:06.724 --> 30:10.758
- I like it.
[both laugh]

30:10.827 --> 30:12.517
It's not gonna be easy.

30:15.137 --> 30:17.000
- Might be fun.

30:17.068 --> 30:19.758
- Wanting to be together
and knowing we can't.

30:21.068 --> 30:23.103
[both laugh]

30:23.172 --> 30:25.862
- Most problems begin
with when you can.

30:27.758 --> 30:28.931
- You really did some
soul-searching out there

30:29.000 --> 30:30.551
in the minefield, didn't you?

30:32.689 --> 30:34.172
- I was fucking scared.

30:35.448 --> 30:37.275
- [laughs]

30:37.344 --> 30:39.655
This is the sexiest thing
I've ever done in my life.

30:42.689 --> 30:45.551
- Yeah, goes without saying,
me too.

30:47.275 --> 30:49.758
- One for the road?

30:54.862 --> 30:56.241
[moans]

30:58.482 --> 30:59.862
Okay, go. Go.

30:59.931 --> 31:01.965
- Yup.
- [clears throat]

31:06.896 --> 31:10.000
[indistinct chatter]

31:15.034 --> 31:16.724
- So what did
Colonel Austin say?

31:18.724 --> 31:20.275
- Why don't you
fuck off, Wittman?

31:20.344 --> 31:21.862
Just fuck off.

31:21.931 --> 31:23.517
- You actually bothered
Colonel Austin with this,

31:23.586 --> 31:25.206
didn't you?

31:25.275 --> 31:27.103
[both laugh]

31:27.172 --> 31:29.448
How dumb can you be?

31:29.517 --> 31:31.965
- Private, move your flat ass.

31:36.310 --> 31:38.620
This says you not only
saw combat

31:38.689 --> 31:41.241
but you're a fucking war hero.
- Huh?

31:41.310 --> 31:43.965
- The incident at the suicide
gates with the stolen uniforms.

31:44.034 --> 31:45.689
You shot an enemy combatant
before he could detonate

31:45.758 --> 31:47.551
an explosive.

31:47.620 --> 31:50.275
- But that's sort of my job.

31:50.344 --> 31:53.000
- That's also the sort of thing
that'll get you a bronze star.

31:55.655 --> 31:57.068
- Why didn't anyone
tell me this?

31:57.137 --> 31:58.275
- It's the army.
Takes months for this shit

31:58.344 --> 31:59.758
to wend its way
through the system.

31:59.827 --> 32:02.482
But this should get you
promoted to E-2,

32:02.551 --> 32:04.620
private second class.
- Thank you, Corporal.

32:04.689 --> 32:06.344
- You're welcome.

32:08.931 --> 32:10.034
Thank you all for insisting

32:10.103 --> 32:11.758
that the record
be set straight.

32:11.827 --> 32:13.379
From now on,
I'd be nice to Petrocelli

32:13.448 --> 32:15.931
because he's on the fast track
to outranking all you pricks.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.724
- Private Second Class
Petrocelli.

32:22.793 --> 32:24.620
It's got a nice ring to it.

32:24.689 --> 32:26.068
- Congrats.
- Thank you.

32:31.206 --> 32:32.724
- I'm proud of the work
you and your team did

32:32.793 --> 32:34.241
on that minefield, Sergeant.

32:34.310 --> 32:36.206
- Thank you, sir.

32:36.275 --> 32:39.241
- Looks like that EOD you
brought in is gonna make it.

32:39.310 --> 32:41.793
- That's welcome news.
- Mm.

32:45.379 --> 32:47.482
Now I have an important mission
for you and your crew

32:47.551 --> 32:50.413
to take care of.
- Yes, sir?

32:50.482 --> 32:52.275
- You're the only one
I could trust to do this.

32:53.689 --> 32:55.517
- Do you mind
if I ask why, sir?

32:55.586 --> 32:57.896
- Because I believe you have
a horse in this race.

32:59.724 --> 33:01.413
You saw what SecCorp did
to Buckley.

33:01.482 --> 33:03.965
You were there.

33:04.034 --> 33:06.379
- What has this got to do
with SecCorp, sir?

33:06.448 --> 33:09.344
- They've overstayed
their unwelcome on this base.

33:09.413 --> 33:11.448
And it's time for me
to do something about it.

33:13.344 --> 33:16.000
- I'm all the way in on that.
- Good.

33:16.068 --> 33:17.482
Because you're gonna be
an important part of this.

33:17.551 --> 33:18.689
- How so?

33:18.758 --> 33:21.206
- Just deliver the water
for now.

33:21.275 --> 33:23.068
I'll tell you when it's time
