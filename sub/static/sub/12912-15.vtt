01:07.700 --> 01:10.500
The reef was gorgeous
this morning.

01:10.580 --> 01:13.340
Honestly,
could this day be any better?

01:13.420 --> 01:16.460
David could have put a bit more
mango in this tropical juice.

01:16.540 --> 01:17.980
More like a sub-tropical juice.

01:18.780 --> 01:21.260
Hi, guys. Check this out.

01:21.340 --> 01:24.940
<i>Secrets of the Deep.</i>
Sounds interesting.

01:25.020 --> 01:28.780
It's a collection of treasures recovered
from the deepest parts of the ocean.

01:28.860 --> 01:31.180
The author's in town for
24 hours signing her book.

01:31.260 --> 01:32.900
We have to go.

01:32.980 --> 01:35.380
Okay. Weilan, you should come.

01:36.180 --> 01:37.660
Sure. Why not?

01:37.740 --> 01:40.260
Awesome.
Well, that makes four of us.

01:40.340 --> 01:43.220
Four?
-Yeah, I invited Karl as well.

01:43.300 --> 01:45.100
The more the merrier, right?

01:47.340 --> 01:49.980
I am not going
on a double-date with Karl!

01:50.060 --> 01:52.700
Well, I'm not interested
in a book signing.

01:52.780 --> 01:55.540
Especially when it's about stuff
I see every day.

01:55.620 --> 01:57.020
Please, Ondina?

01:57.100 --> 02:00.300
You never know. You might
have a nice time with Karl.

02:01.220 --> 02:02.860
I can't believe
you just said that.

02:02.940 --> 02:04.620
What's wrong with him?

02:08.740 --> 02:11.020
Everything.
-Then don't go.

02:11.100 --> 02:12.660
But I already told
Mimmi I would.

02:12.740 --> 02:14.980
I didn't.

02:15.060 --> 02:17.580
You're going to make me beg,
aren't you?

02:17.660 --> 02:19.380
Well, I would kind
of like to see that.

02:22.180 --> 02:24.540
Please come.

02:25.580 --> 02:28.220
You call that begging?

02:35.940 --> 02:37.700
Hey, Weilan.

02:37.780 --> 02:40.020
Ondina,
I didn't know you were coming.

02:40.100 --> 02:43.580
You sound disappointed.
-No, no, I, um...

02:43.660 --> 02:45.860
I just thought it was
going to be the four of us.

02:45.940 --> 02:47.140
I did, too.

02:47.220 --> 02:48.820
That's why I invited Ondina.

02:48.900 --> 02:50.740
I couldn't stay away.

02:50.820 --> 02:52.700
Love a good book signing.

02:54.180 --> 02:55.300
Let's go in.

03:06.700 --> 03:09.860
So some old guy's
salvaged this from the sea?

03:09.940 --> 03:13.780
Actually, it was all found by a woman
and she's not much older than us.

03:21.980 --> 03:25.500
"Cast iron statue of an Indian
farm worker, 14th century.

03:25.580 --> 03:29.180
Recovered from the Bay of Bengal
at a depth of 2,500 meters."

03:29.260 --> 03:32.100
I bet she's rich.
-Why do you say that?

03:32.180 --> 03:33.660
Deep sea diving needs resources.

03:33.740 --> 03:36.180
She must have a submersible
to get that deep,

03:36.260 --> 03:39.180
and they cost mega bucks.

03:39.260 --> 03:41.540
She probably sells
all the stuff she finds.

03:41.620 --> 03:42.780
Well, according to this,

03:42.860 --> 03:45.060
she donates everything
she finds to a foundation,

03:45.140 --> 03:49.460
and then they organize exhibitions of
her discoveries all around the world.

03:49.540 --> 03:51.220
I bet she makes a
heap selling those.

03:56.260 --> 03:57.500
Ladies and gentlemen...

03:58.140 --> 04:02.100
the extraordinary underwater explorer
and writer of <i>Secrets of the Deep</i>

04:02.180 --> 04:04.900
is now ready to sign copies
of her new book.

04:04.980 --> 04:06.900
Please, take your place in line.

04:07.580 --> 04:09.260
Come on, let's go.

04:11.700 --> 04:14.100
Here she is.
A big round of applause.

04:22.580 --> 04:23.740
Welcome.

04:28.180 --> 04:29.460
Hi.

04:31.940 --> 04:33.140
Thanks for coming.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.020
Hello.

04:38.300 --> 04:39.380
Thanks for coming.

04:39.460 --> 04:40.580
Hi.
-Hi.

04:40.660 --> 04:43.140
Uh, could you make it out
to "Chris," please?

04:48.860 --> 04:49.900
Thanks for coming.

04:49.980 --> 04:52.220
Could we get a photo?
-Sure.

05:01.820 --> 05:03.140
Thank you.
-Thanks.

05:04.060 --> 05:05.060
Hi.

05:05.940 --> 05:07.860
Thanks so much.

05:10.460 --> 05:11.900
Excuse me, Ms. Chadwick.

05:11.980 --> 05:14.900
The television crew is on their way.
-All right.

05:14.980 --> 05:16.420
Hi.

05:16.500 --> 05:19.180
So much of our planet
is unexplored.

05:20.180 --> 05:24.540
Most of the world is covered by water. We
know so little about what's down there.

05:24.620 --> 05:27.060
The pieces on display are just
a sample of what I've found.

05:27.140 --> 05:29.620
The full collection, which
includes a number of large statues,

05:29.700 --> 05:31.220
will be arriving next month.

05:31.300 --> 05:33.380
You are a great success story,
Ms. Chadwick.

05:33.460 --> 05:36.220
Local girl turned
international celebrity.

05:36.300 --> 05:38.180
What got you
interested in diving?

05:39.140 --> 05:41.060
I can honestly say
that I woke up one day

05:41.140 --> 05:43.420
and decided that it was
something I needed to do.

05:43.500 --> 05:46.180
Your exhibition is called
"Secrets of the Deep."

05:46.260 --> 05:47.860
Do you have a secret?

05:49.020 --> 05:51.060
Eight hours sleep
and a good hair conditioner.

05:51.140 --> 05:53.140
Thank you, Ms. Chadwick.

06:01.860 --> 06:04.380
She comes from here?
-Yeah.

06:04.460 --> 06:07.180
In the book she says she got
her start diving on Mako Island.

06:08.100 --> 06:09.300
This is really beautiful.

06:09.380 --> 06:12.020
"Gold bracelet, Shan Dynasty.

06:12.100 --> 06:16.140
Recovered from the East China
Sea at a depth of 1,000 meters.

06:16.220 --> 06:18.740
It is mentioned in the legend
of Ji Long the dragon..."

06:18.820 --> 06:21.060
Jiao Long the dragon.
-Right.

06:21.860 --> 06:24.620
Uh, "...where a water spirit
defeated a dragon."

06:25.460 --> 06:27.860
A water spirit.
- Yeah, what's that?

06:27.940 --> 06:29.940
A wet ghost?

06:30.020 --> 06:31.220
We need to go.

06:31.300 --> 06:33.820
Why?
-There's something you need to see.

06:33.900 --> 06:36.020
Ondina? Come on.
-What?

06:36.900 --> 06:39.060
Where are they going?
-Mimmi!

06:43.460 --> 06:44.540
What's going on?

06:44.620 --> 06:47.380
Just... hang here, okay?

06:48.300 --> 06:50.140
We'll be back soon.

06:53.820 --> 06:55.260
What are we doing?

06:55.340 --> 06:57.500
I've got a hunch.
-About what?

06:58.580 --> 06:59.900
Humor me, okay?

07:03.220 --> 07:05.060
The Jiao Long Dragon?

07:06.860 --> 07:08.180
It is not for sale.

07:09.300 --> 07:12.060
I told my friends
how lovely the painting is.

07:12.140 --> 07:14.580
Could we see it? Please?

07:24.300 --> 07:27.140
This painting is by a famous
Chinese artist.

07:31.500 --> 07:33.060
Very beautiful, yes?

07:34.260 --> 07:36.140
Um... Uncle Shen,

07:36.220 --> 07:39.260
is there any chance we could
have some of your wonderful tea?

07:39.340 --> 07:44.140
Oh, uh... for three lovely
ladies, it will be my pleasure.

07:52.900 --> 07:55.260
What are you now, an art critic?

07:55.340 --> 07:56.820
Give me a sec.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.380
If that's Jiao Long...

08:07.180 --> 08:09.140
Yes! The water spirit.

08:11.580 --> 08:12.620
She's a mermaid.

08:14.340 --> 08:16.140
Now look at her wrist.

08:18.860 --> 08:20.900
It's the bracelet.
-Mmm-hmm.

08:20.980 --> 08:23.060
The exact same
bracelet we just saw.

08:24.100 --> 08:27.540
The legend says that a water
spirit defeated a dragon.

08:29.180 --> 08:32.020
What if the bracelet
kills dragons?

08:41.940 --> 08:43.860
So, basically,
this chick cruises the world,

08:43.940 --> 08:45.380
goes down in her sub,

08:45.460 --> 08:48.260
brings up whatever she likes
and gets paid for it?

08:48.340 --> 08:49.900
What a life!

08:49.980 --> 08:51.780
Yeah, it's great,
except for the fact

08:51.860 --> 08:53.700
that if her equipment
goes wrong at that depth,

08:53.780 --> 08:55.820
the water pressure is going
to crush her flat in a second.

08:55.900 --> 08:57.900
Well, everything has a downside.

09:00.940 --> 09:02.220
We could grab it and run.

09:05.220 --> 09:06.460
Maybe not.

09:07.660 --> 09:10.500
That woman is too young
to have collected all this.

09:10.580 --> 09:13.780
It would take years and years
to find them.

09:13.860 --> 09:15.580
One of us could have managed it.

09:16.740 --> 09:18.940
That reporter said
she got her start on Mako.

09:19.740 --> 09:23.060
You don't think she's a...
-Well, if she is, she might help us.

09:25.180 --> 09:28.100
So let's just go and ask her
straight up if she's a mermaid.

09:30.740 --> 09:33.300
That was a joke.

09:35.820 --> 09:39.300
Sorry, this is a private area.
I'll be signing autographs later.

09:39.380 --> 09:41.660
We just wanted to say how much
we enjoyed the book signing.

09:41.740 --> 09:43.220
Thank you.

09:43.300 --> 09:46.460
The dragon bracelet
is fascinating.

09:46.540 --> 09:48.180
It is a lovely piece.

09:48.260 --> 09:51.380
According to the legend,
it belonged to a water spirit.

09:52.420 --> 09:55.860
That is what the legend says.
Now, would you mind...

09:56.540 --> 09:59.980
A water spirit
is another name for mermaid.

10:02.900 --> 10:05.220
Really?
-Yes.

10:06.260 --> 10:07.500
Like you.

10:11.340 --> 10:15.740
I have no idea what you're talking
about. Now, would you mind...

10:15.820 --> 10:18.580
I think you know exactly
what I'm talking about.

10:26.540 --> 10:29.140
How did you know?
-I wasn't certain...

10:29.220 --> 10:30.900
until you did that.

10:33.140 --> 10:36.500
So, you guys fell into
the moon pool, too?

10:38.460 --> 10:41.700
She's a land girl, like Evie.

10:41.780 --> 10:44.740
You weren't always a mermaid,
were you?

10:45.540 --> 10:48.420
We are. We were born at sea.

10:50.580 --> 10:51.740
Real mermaids?

10:51.820 --> 10:54.460
I'm feeling pretty real.
Right, girls?

10:56.780 --> 10:59.460
What do you want?
-That bracelet.

10:59.540 --> 11:01.780
It's not going to happen.

11:01.860 --> 11:05.340
Our pod is being threatened by a
dragon that could destroy us all.

11:05.420 --> 11:07.620
That bracelet is our only hope.
-A dragon?

11:07.700 --> 11:10.020
I know it's hard to believe,
but we're telling the truth.

11:10.100 --> 11:11.620
If you think
I'm just going to hand over

11:11.700 --> 11:15.460
a priceless artifact
to a bunch of deluded teenagers,

11:15.540 --> 11:16.740
you're dreaming.

11:16.820 --> 11:19.860
Excuse me.
This is a restricted area.

11:19.940 --> 11:22.700
I must ask you to leave.
I'm so sorry, Ms. Chadwick.

11:22.780 --> 11:25.260
It's quite all right.
They were just going.

11:26.300 --> 11:29.300
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

11:48.380 --> 11:51.540
I've looked everywhere.
They're not here.

11:51.620 --> 11:53.540
Face it, mate,
we've been ditched.

11:53.620 --> 11:55.180
Out you go, you three.

12:08.860 --> 12:11.020
Hey! What happened in there?

12:11.100 --> 12:13.020
Did you break something?
-No.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.740
Where did you go?
-There was something we needed to do.

12:15.820 --> 12:19.540
Can we go get something to eat now?
-Sorry, we have to go again.

12:19.620 --> 12:23.380
Why? What's going on?
-I can't explain right now.

12:23.460 --> 12:25.300
So when can you?

12:26.340 --> 12:27.500
I'm sorry.

12:33.220 --> 12:34.460
What was that about?

12:39.220 --> 12:41.620
You can't be serious. Why not?

12:41.700 --> 12:45.260
This whole idea is based on some
centuries-old Chinese legend.

12:46.540 --> 12:49.220
So?
- Come on, Weilan.

12:49.300 --> 12:51.900
We're not living in a fairy tale.
-Hello?

12:52.860 --> 12:54.260
We're mermaids.

12:54.340 --> 12:58.540
If there is even a remote chance that
that bracelet can do what the legend says,

12:58.620 --> 12:59.780
we have to get it.

12:59.860 --> 13:03.580
You're going to steal it?
-That woman's not going to give it to us.

13:04.380 --> 13:05.860
We wouldn't be stealing.

13:05.940 --> 13:08.300
It belongs to the Eastern pod.
My people.

13:08.380 --> 13:10.460
So, technically,
it's not stealing at all.

13:10.540 --> 13:12.380
And by destroying the dragon,

13:12.460 --> 13:15.620
we are making the oceans safe
for all mermaids, including her.

13:15.700 --> 13:18.180
So, really...
we're doing her a favor.

13:18.260 --> 13:20.300
Well,
when you put it like that...

13:22.620 --> 13:24.060
I've got to tell you,

13:24.140 --> 13:26.780
being a customer is way less
stressful than being a boss.

13:26.860 --> 13:29.900
I'm sure the world of customer
service mourns your departure.

13:29.980 --> 13:31.100
Oh, ha-ha.

13:33.180 --> 13:34.740
There you go.
- Thank you.

13:34.820 --> 13:37.980
I've just got to make sure the new
waitress is okay, and then I'm all yours.

13:38.060 --> 13:40.180
I'm so lucky.
-Better believe it.

13:46.220 --> 13:48.780
If you help,
we get out of here sooner.

13:51.540 --> 13:52.740
They're helpless without me.

14:05.020 --> 14:06.300
Hey, Zac.

14:06.380 --> 14:08.220
Do you mind if I have a word?

14:09.380 --> 14:10.900
Sure. What's up?

14:10.980 --> 14:13.700
You seem to know Mimmi
pretty well, right?

14:13.780 --> 14:16.420
Yeah. So?

14:16.500 --> 14:18.700
I just can't make
any sense of her.

14:18.780 --> 14:21.420
Every time I think we're
getting close, she shuts me out,

14:21.500 --> 14:24.020
and I'm starting to wonder
if she actually likes me.

14:24.100 --> 14:26.820
Trust me. She does.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.900
I'm not so sure.

14:30.420 --> 14:32.540
Look, I can honestly say

14:32.620 --> 14:35.060
she has never liked any guy
as much as you.

14:37.300 --> 14:40.140
Then why do I get the feeling
she's hiding something from me?

14:40.220 --> 14:42.860
Search me.
Who knows what she thinks?

14:42.940 --> 14:44.860
Well, I was hoping you do.

14:47.740 --> 14:49.660
Look, let's forget it.

14:49.740 --> 14:53.260
I was just trying to get a
straight answer, but I guess not.

14:54.580 --> 14:56.580
There is nothing going on.

14:56.660 --> 15:00.140
Mimmi's just an ordinary girl.
No secrets there.

15:02.500 --> 15:06.100
I have an assignment I need
to finish. I'll see you.

15:06.180 --> 15:07.540
See you, Zac.

15:16.980 --> 15:19.260
I presume this is
not a social call.

15:20.100 --> 15:21.900
We need your help.

15:21.980 --> 15:24.220
Hang on.
Chris has been asking about you.

15:24.300 --> 15:26.700
What did he want to know?
-What your secret is.

15:26.780 --> 15:28.460
I wish I could tell him.

15:28.540 --> 15:31.060
Can we forget about
dolphin boy and focus?

15:33.820 --> 15:37.940
Zac, we think we have found a
weapon that could slay the dragon.

15:38.740 --> 15:41.660
For real?
-No, I just said it 'cause it sounds good.

15:42.980 --> 15:46.220
The problem is, it's... It's a
little tricky to get hold of.

15:46.300 --> 15:47.580
What she means is...

15:47.660 --> 15:51.220
it's in a locked case in a
secure room that's guarded 24/7.

15:51.300 --> 15:54.260
So, if you don't want to help,
that's okay...

15:54.340 --> 15:57.460
Are you kidding?
You had me at dragon slayer.

16:53.660 --> 16:55.180
So far so good.

17:09.660 --> 17:11.300
What now?

17:27.940 --> 17:29.140
Let me.

17:44.260 --> 17:45.580
Where is it?

17:48.740 --> 17:50.260
Looking for this?

17:51.420 --> 17:53.620
Hand it over.
-And why would I do that?

17:54.340 --> 17:59.020
Oh, that's right, so that
you can destroy a dragon.

17:59.100 --> 18:01.020
What kind of fantasy
world do you live in?

18:01.100 --> 18:03.300
We're telling you the truth.
We need it.

18:03.380 --> 18:06.620
This isn't some trinket that
I plucked off a sandy seabed.

18:06.700 --> 18:09.220
I was a thousand meters down,
in the dark and the cold.

18:09.300 --> 18:10.780
We know what that's like.

18:10.860 --> 18:13.740
So maybe you can understand that
this is what I do for a living,

18:13.820 --> 18:16.860
and I'm not about to give up the
bracelet based on some fairy tale.

18:16.940 --> 18:18.740
You can save your
breath for the police.

18:18.820 --> 18:20.500
You're bluffing.

18:20.580 --> 18:24.820
Maybe I pressed it, maybe I didn't.
Why don't you hang around and find out?

18:32.180 --> 18:34.540
We're mermaids and so are you.

18:34.620 --> 18:36.300
You can't turn your back on us!

18:36.380 --> 18:38.620
As far as I'm concerned,
you're just thieves.

18:51.580 --> 18:53.100
I have a trick or two myself.

19:02.260 --> 19:04.500
This... is a moon ring.

19:04.580 --> 19:07.940
Think of your powers
magnified a thousand times.

19:08.900 --> 19:11.780
My advice? Do as we say.

19:30.460 --> 19:31.700
I'm not giving you the bracelet.

19:31.780 --> 19:33.340
If we don't stop the dragon,

19:33.420 --> 19:35.860
we'll all lose our powers,
and then it will come for you!

19:35.940 --> 19:38.100
What part of "no"
don't you understand?

19:39.620 --> 19:43.060
We don't want to hurt you,
but we need your help.

19:45.820 --> 19:47.580
They're here.

19:47.660 --> 19:49.860
We need to go. But the bracelet!

19:49.940 --> 19:51.940
We'll never get it
if we get arrested.

20:04.380 --> 20:06.980
Quick, hurry up!
All right, all right.

20:18.820 --> 20:19.900
Open it. Quickly!

20:23.340 --> 20:24.900
Let me!

20:25.740 --> 20:27.260
It's hot!

20:38.580 --> 20:40.700
Did you get it?
-It was tougher than we thought.

20:44.220 --> 20:46.980
Ms. Chadwick, are you all right?
The alarm went off.

20:47.060 --> 20:50.940
Yes, yes. Everything's fine.
-Good. Thank you.

20:51.020 --> 20:52.260
Thank you.

20:53.420 --> 20:54.700
Check downstairs.

21:05.260 --> 21:08.660
She leaves town tomorrow.
-Bye-bye, bracelet.

21:08.740 --> 21:11.740
The full moon's tomorrow.
-Thanks for reminding me.

21:11.820 --> 21:13.500
Are you sure
the bracelet would have worked?

21:13.580 --> 21:15.740
It was better than what we've
got now, which is nothing.

21:15.820 --> 21:17.460
So, what now?

21:17.540 --> 21:20.420
We just stay out of the ocean
and never go back?

21:20.500 --> 21:23.660
No way am I going to hide from some
dragon for the rest of my life.

21:23.740 --> 21:24.980
Me neither.

21:25.820 --> 21:28.020
Mimmi.

21:44.940 --> 21:46.740
I'm sorry about today.

21:46.820 --> 21:48.620
Will you tell me
what's going on?

21:48.700 --> 21:50.340
Nothing.

21:50.420 --> 21:52.060
Come on, Mimmi. I'm not stupid.

21:52.140 --> 21:54.300
First you run out on me
at the book signing,

21:54.380 --> 21:56.620
then the next time I see you
you're being thrown out.

21:56.700 --> 21:58.220
What's the story?

21:59.460 --> 22:01.580
You can tell me.
I won't judge you.

22:01.660 --> 22:04.300
If there is anything you
needed to know, I'd tell you.

22:05.260 --> 22:06.420
So there is something.

22:08.140 --> 22:10.860
It's complicated.
-You just don't trust me enough.

22:10.940 --> 22:12.420
It's not that.
-Then what?

22:16.260 --> 22:18.860
You know what?
This isn't working.

22:18.940 --> 22:20.460
Chris, please.

22:20.540 --> 22:23.100
I can't be with someone
who won't tell me the truth.

22:24.980 --> 22:26.380
I'm sorry, Mimmi.

22:40.780 --> 22:43.180
Everything's accounted for,
Ms. Chadwick.

22:43.260 --> 22:45.260
Must be a false alarm.

22:45.340 --> 22:46.820
Yes. Thank you.

23:02.140 --> 23:03.860
<i>* In this world *</i>

23:03.940 --> 23:05.260
<i>* We're all alone *</i>

23:05.340 --> 23:08.660

23:08.740 --> 23:10.740
