00:03.647 --> 00:06.366
You're absolutely right, Doctor.
Right now,

00:06.447 --> 00:09.564
I can't imagine
ever hurting anybody.

00:09.647 --> 00:13.003
How do you feel
about that person you used to be?

00:16.087 --> 00:17.998
I feel terrible.

00:18.087 --> 00:20.726
But thanks to you,
I'm doing much better now.

00:20.807 --> 00:23.924
I'm confident that when I leave,

00:24.007 --> 00:27.317
I will be ready
to take my place in society.

00:28.207 --> 00:33.520
- When do you think that will be?
- Well, now. Right away.

00:34.047 --> 00:35.799
Why do you say that?

00:37.967 --> 00:42.119
You said that when I was able
to accept what I'd done

00:42.207 --> 00:47.042
and I understood the consequences
of my actions, I would be free to go.

00:47.127 --> 00:48.640
Free to go?

00:48.727 --> 00:52.276
You don't think you should
stand trial for what you did?

00:52.367 --> 00:55.882
No, I'm looking forward
to proving my innocence.

00:55.967 --> 00:59.277
I thought you said
you accepted what you did.

00:59.367 --> 01:00.720
No.

01:01.807 --> 01:03.877
That's not what I meant.

01:06.167 --> 01:08.158
I was sick when it happened.

01:08.647 --> 01:11.286
I wasn't responsible
for what I did.

01:12.167 --> 01:16.399
How do I know you're not just
telling me what I want to hear?

01:16.487 --> 01:19.365
We should continue
this discussion next week.

01:19.447 --> 01:22.166
No, I wanna talk about this now!

01:22.247 --> 01:24.807
You're starting to sound angry again.

01:24.887 --> 01:27.162
Maybe you need another treatment.

01:27.247 --> 01:30.637
What I need is to get out of
this cell. I've been here for days.

01:30.727 --> 01:35.084
You've controlled my every move.
Told me what to eat, think and say.

01:35.167 --> 01:38.955
When I show
a glimmer of independent thought,

01:39.047 --> 01:43.199
you strap me down, inject me
with drugs. You call it a treatment!

01:43.287 --> 01:46.085
- You are becoming agitated.
- You bet I'm agitated!

01:46.167 --> 01:50.240
I may be surrounded by insanity
but I'm not insane.

01:50.327 --> 01:53.285
There isn't any... There isn't...

01:53.367 --> 01:54.766
There's nothing...

01:56.527 --> 02:01.920
I'm sorry. Could we go back
to "You're becoming agitated"?

02:02.007 --> 02:04.601
No. Why don't we break for tonight?

02:04.687 --> 02:06.757
I think we've made progress.

02:06.847 --> 02:09.441
I'm still not comfortable
with that speech.

02:09.526 --> 02:13.202
There's such a thing as
over-rehearsing. You'll be fine.

02:13.287 --> 02:17.644
I don't know. Maybe
I'm just not right for this part.

02:17.727 --> 02:20.844
Most humanoids have
the potential to be irrational.

02:20.927 --> 02:23.566
Attempt to access
that part of your psyche.

02:23.647 --> 02:25.444
Thank you, Data.

02:25.527 --> 02:28.564
Your character
feels as if the world's against him.

02:29.127 --> 02:33.006
- Like my first year at the Academy.
- Yes. That's your character.

02:33.087 --> 02:36.443
But I want you, Will Riker, to relax.

02:36.527 --> 02:40.566
- I'll do my best.
- You're gonna knock 'em dead.

02:41.527 --> 02:42.755
Right.

02:48.167 --> 02:52.558
You control my every move. You
tell me what to say, what to think.

02:53.047 --> 02:55.003
What to eat, what to say...

02:55.087 --> 02:56.998
What to think, what to eat...

02:57.087 --> 03:01.478
Then when I show
a glimmer of independent thought,

03:01.567 --> 03:04.639
you strap me down, inject me,
call it a treatment.

03:04.727 --> 03:08.163
I may be surrounded by insanity
but I am not insane!

03:11.127 --> 03:12.765
Excuse me.

03:14.000 --> 03:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:48.007 --> 03:51.079
Space, the final frontier.

03:52.767 --> 03:56.123
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

03:56.567 --> 04:00.685
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds,...

04:01.767 --> 04:05.282
..to seek out new life
and new civilizations,...

04:06.367 --> 04:09.598
..to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

05:05.047 --> 05:08.119
Tilonus IV?
Didn't their government collapse?

05:08.207 --> 05:09.686
It's total anarchy.

05:09.767 --> 05:12.235
When the Prime Minister
was assassinated,

05:12.327 --> 05:15.364
a Federation research team
was on the planet.

05:15.447 --> 05:17.756
It's believed
they were forced into hiding.

05:17.847 --> 05:20.520
Your mission will be
to locate and evacuate them.

05:20.607 --> 05:22.438
Can't they go to the authorities?

05:22.527 --> 05:24.961
There are none.
The government is splintered.

05:25.047 --> 05:28.323
It seems there are various factions
vying for power.

05:28.407 --> 05:32.366
They're desperate for weapons
or technology of any kind.

05:32.447 --> 05:36.838
Apparently, some of the factions
have resorted to torture

05:36.927 --> 05:39.202
to gather their information.

05:39.287 --> 05:41.881
A Starfleet team
will be a prime target.

05:43.327 --> 05:46.717
I'll have to go down there alone,
under cover.

05:46.807 --> 05:51.278
Agreed. Mr. Worf will give you
a briefing on Tilonian culture.

05:51.967 --> 05:55.926
Well, I guess I'll have to
back out of Beverly's play.

05:56.007 --> 05:59.158
No. There will be
plenty of time for that.

05:59.247 --> 06:01.636
We don't arrive
on Tilonus for five days.

06:02.407 --> 06:06.798
Besides, if you back out, she'll come
after me to play the part.

06:13.727 --> 06:16.525
This is the last known location
of the team.

06:16.607 --> 06:19.804
They had occupied a building
in the southwest.

06:19.887 --> 06:21.206
Begin there.

06:21.287 --> 06:25.485
That's over 200 square kilometers.
A lot of land for one man to cover.

06:25.567 --> 06:27.717
I guess I'll pack extra boots.

06:30.927 --> 06:34.044
This apparel will help you pass
as a common merchant.

06:34.887 --> 06:38.562
This Tilonian pendant is equipped
with a communicator circuit.

06:38.647 --> 06:41.161
Doesn't really match the outfit.

06:41.247 --> 06:43.397
I suggest you pay closer attention.

06:43.487 --> 06:46.081
Your life will be at stake.

06:46.167 --> 06:49.477
- Do you understand?
- Of course I do.

06:50.607 --> 06:53.280
Because you will be posing
as a merchant,

06:53.367 --> 06:57.883
you will need to know
how to use the nisroh for bartering.

06:57.967 --> 07:01.243
You will be judged
on your prowess with a blade.

07:06.367 --> 07:07.800
I'm sorry!

07:07.887 --> 07:10.560
- I did not intend...
- It's OK.

07:10.647 --> 07:13.798
I guess I wasn't paying attention.
I'll go to sickbay.

07:13.887 --> 07:15.923
We'll continue this later.

07:19.447 --> 07:22.883
Boy, you will do anything
to get out of this play.

07:22.967 --> 07:25.197
You'll have to do better than this.

07:25.287 --> 07:28.324
The play's not till tomorrow night.
I've got 24 hours.

07:31.967 --> 07:36.279
Don't get any ideas. I will see you
on stage at 1800 hours.

07:36.367 --> 07:37.561
Right.

07:39.607 --> 07:41.199
That still hurts.

07:42.567 --> 07:46.480
There was no damage to the nerve,
so you shouldn't feel pain.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.922
Probably just a symptom
of stage fright.

07:49.487 --> 07:51.045
It hurts!

07:51.127 --> 07:55.120
He was working on a conduit.
A plasma torch blew up in his hands.

07:55.207 --> 07:56.322
It hurts! Please!

07:56.407 --> 07:58.363
- Hypospray.
- Yes, Doctor.

07:59.847 --> 08:03.999
Get me 20cc of opporozine.
Treat the surface burns.

08:04.087 --> 08:06.840
Yes, Doctor.
Should we get a stasis unit?

08:06.927 --> 08:10.442
Have one standing by.
Get me an epidermal sample.

08:11.567 --> 08:16.163
Begin dermal regeneration.
Have tissue regrowth standing by.

08:16.247 --> 08:19.319
I've been on a lot of missions,
seen people injured,

08:19.407 --> 08:22.160
but I have never been affected
like this.

08:22.247 --> 08:26.638
- He was looking right at me.
- That was disturbing to you?

08:26.727 --> 08:29.241
It was as if he was blaming me.

08:29.327 --> 08:32.524
This wasn't the only incident.
The last several days,

08:32.607 --> 08:36.202
I've felt everybody's been
staring at me or talking about me.

08:36.287 --> 08:38.118
It's as if I was in Frame of Mind,

08:38.207 --> 08:41.244
- Frame of Mind?
- Beverly's play.

08:41.327 --> 08:45.161
Ever since I began rehearsing,
I've been uneasy and restless.

08:45.767 --> 08:49.237
You're drawing on feelings
you're not used to expressing.

08:49.327 --> 08:50.646
Right.

08:51.447 --> 08:54.484
The play is full
of disturbing images.

08:55.207 --> 08:58.597
People losing their minds,
being tortured by doctors.

08:58.687 --> 09:01.360
I can't get it out of my mind.

09:02.127 --> 09:06.837
Sometimes it's healthy to explore
the darker side of the psyche.

09:06.927 --> 09:10.124
Jung called it
"owning your own shadow".

09:11.887 --> 09:14.765
This could be a sign
that you're a real actor.

09:14.847 --> 09:16.963
This is becoming more than a role.

09:17.047 --> 09:18.639
Maybe you're right.

09:18.727 --> 09:22.515
Don't be afraid of your darker side.
Have fun with it.

09:28.807 --> 09:30.126
Who was that?

09:32.087 --> 09:33.645
You just missed him.

09:33.727 --> 09:37.879
- Is there a new lieutenant?
- I'm not sure. Should I check?

09:37.967 --> 09:40.435
No. I'll check tomorrow.
I'm going to bed.

09:40.527 --> 09:42.916
The performance is tomorrow night.

09:43.007 --> 09:45.840
I'm looking forward to it.
Break a leg.

09:45.927 --> 09:48.157
I'll try not to take you literally.

09:52.887 --> 09:56.357
- You're becoming agitated.
- You bet I'm agitated!

09:56.447 --> 09:59.962
I may be surrounded by insanity
but I am not insane.

10:00.047 --> 10:03.596
Nothing you or anyone else can say
will change that!

10:03.687 --> 10:06.884
And I won't let you
tell me that I am.

10:06.967 --> 10:09.879
You may be able to destroy my mind.

10:10.527 --> 10:13.837
But you can't change the fact
that I'm innocent.

10:13.927 --> 10:16.282
I didn't kill that man!

10:17.527 --> 10:20.360
And that's what's driving you crazy.

10:20.647 --> 10:23.445
I can see we have
a lot of work to do.

10:28.007 --> 10:31.397
Nothing you can say
will change the fact I'm innocent!

10:31.487 --> 10:33.239
I'm not crazy!

10:34.887 --> 10:36.798
I'm not crazy.

10:40.487 --> 10:42.239
I'm not crazy.

11:00.287 --> 11:01.686
Bravo!

11:04.647 --> 11:06.956
Bravo! Well done!

11:29.087 --> 11:32.238
I can see we have
a lot of work to do.

11:39.167 --> 11:40.805
Where am I?

11:41.567 --> 11:45.560
- How did you get me off the ship?
- The ship again?

11:52.007 --> 11:53.406
What's going on?

11:53.487 --> 11:58.117
I understand this must be disturbing
for you, but try to relax.

11:59.447 --> 12:01.836
Tell me,
where were you a moment ago?

12:01.927 --> 12:05.522
I was on the Enterprise,
in the middle of a play.

12:05.607 --> 12:09.680
But it was here. It was not real,
it was on a stage.

12:09.767 --> 12:15.000
I can assure you, this is not
a stage. Do you remember your name?

12:15.607 --> 12:17.245
I'm Commander...

12:21.287 --> 12:22.606
Commander...

12:30.167 --> 12:33.079
A second ago, I knew who I was.

12:34.207 --> 12:36.880
I was on the ship. I was in a play.

12:38.167 --> 12:41.045
Now I'm having trouble
remembering anything.

12:41.127 --> 12:44.881
That's good. You're coming out
of your delusional state.

12:44.967 --> 12:48.004
Delusional?
It was not a delusion. I was there.

12:50.087 --> 12:52.043
We discussed this.

12:52.527 --> 12:57.237
Do you remember, we contacted
Starfleet and asked them about you?

12:57.327 --> 13:00.239
- No.
- We spoke with Admiral Budrow.

13:00.767 --> 13:03.235
Starbase 29.

13:04.527 --> 13:06.597
He had never heard of me.

13:07.247 --> 13:10.000
They had no officer
that fit my description.

13:10.087 --> 13:11.884
That's right.

13:12.567 --> 13:16.958
Now, I want you to focus
on who I am. Do you remember me?

13:19.767 --> 13:23.316
- I don't know.
- I'm Dr Syrus.

13:24.087 --> 13:28.160
Do you remember anything
about where you are now?

13:30.407 --> 13:32.125
My head hurts.

13:34.447 --> 13:37.359
- Somebody hit me.
- You tried to escape.

13:37.447 --> 13:41.042
You struggled with an attendant
and hit your head. Remember?

13:42.527 --> 13:44.040
Yes.

13:44.927 --> 13:48.476
I remember that now.
I thought a Klingon had cut me.

13:48.567 --> 13:50.797
That's called transposition.

13:50.887 --> 13:55.039
You're projecting elements
from your delusions onto real events.

13:55.127 --> 13:56.446
But that's good.

13:56.527 --> 13:58.040
There was a time

13:58.127 --> 14:02.598
when you couldn't break away
from your starship fantasy at all.

14:08.047 --> 14:09.400
Now, ...

14:10.527 --> 14:12.882
..if what you say is true, ...

14:14.847 --> 14:16.166
..where am I?

14:17.007 --> 14:21.523
You're in ward 47 of the Tilonus
Institute For Mental Disorders.

14:25.167 --> 14:29.683
- Why am I here?
- We'll talk more later.

14:30.647 --> 14:33.241
You don't have to remember
everything today.

14:35.807 --> 14:38.116
You're making excellent progress.

14:43.567 --> 14:44.966
Wait!

15:20.847 --> 15:24.806
Good afternoon.
I've got some good news for you.

15:25.367 --> 15:28.598
Dr Syrus suggested that
you might enjoy a couple of hours

15:28.687 --> 15:31.076
in the common area today.

15:33.847 --> 15:34.916
Well?

15:37.567 --> 15:39.159
I guess so.

15:44.567 --> 15:49.004
I hope you're hungry. They're
serving spiny lobe-fish today.

15:49.687 --> 15:51.439
You won't need that.

15:52.287 --> 15:54.596
That's what you said last time.

16:58.687 --> 17:00.962
I'll be back with your lunch.

17:15.446 --> 17:17.563
I hear you're a Starfleet officer.

17:18.926 --> 17:21.202
I'm Cmdr Bloom from the Yorktown.

17:22.406 --> 17:25.001
There are a dozen of us here,
maybe more.

17:25.087 --> 17:28.557
We were kidnapped.
Brought here against our will.

17:29.127 --> 17:33.245
Sanders was on the Yosemite.
They did something to his mind.

17:33.327 --> 17:37.036
I think they're trying to get
neurochemicals from our brains.

17:37.127 --> 17:41.598
Stafko was on the Yorktown.
I don't know what they did to him.

17:45.127 --> 17:48.836
We're going to get out of here.
I've made a communicator.

17:48.927 --> 17:50.519
- You have?
- Yes.

17:50.607 --> 17:54.441
There are three starships
in orbit. They will beam us out.

17:54.527 --> 17:56.802
I'll ask them to get you out, too.

18:02.887 --> 18:05.447
Cmdr Bloom to Yorktown.
Come in, Yorktown.

18:05.527 --> 18:07.882
I've made contact
with another officer.

18:07.967 --> 18:10.435
- Talking to your starship, Jaya?
- No.

18:13.127 --> 18:15.357
Don't let them tell you you're crazy.

18:19.967 --> 18:24.006
You know you're not supposed to
take utensils from the common area.

18:36.567 --> 18:38.125
You're welcome to try.

18:40.207 --> 18:43.279
- I'm not that far gone, am I?
- Of course you are.

18:47.567 --> 18:50.877
Your name is Mavek.

18:50.967 --> 18:54.118
That's right.
Not bad for a crazy man.

18:57.527 --> 19:00.200
I am beginning to remember
certain things.

19:02.047 --> 19:03.446
Why am I here?

19:03.527 --> 19:05.961
I remember
when they brought you in.

19:06.047 --> 19:10.006
You were struggling, screaming.
We could barely hold you down.

19:10.087 --> 19:14.763
In fact, just getting the blood off
your hands took over an hour.

19:15.327 --> 19:18.717
- Blood?
- On your hands, clothes.

19:18.807 --> 19:21.958
You didn't just kill that man,
you mutilated him.

19:22.047 --> 19:24.163
What? I didn't kill anybody.

19:24.247 --> 19:26.044
I'm afraid you did.

19:26.127 --> 19:27.845
You stabbed him.

19:27.927 --> 19:32.205
They found you near the body,
the knife in your hand.

19:32.287 --> 19:33.640
No!

19:34.647 --> 19:36.842
- It's not true!
- Yes, it is.

19:36.927 --> 19:39.566
And if you ever get out,
you'll stand trial.

19:39.647 --> 19:41.046
You're lying!

19:41.127 --> 19:43.641
I imagine the punishment
will be severe,

19:43.727 --> 19:46.605
considering
you stabbed him nine times.

19:46.687 --> 19:47.915
No!

20:13.767 --> 20:18.522
I was there. I was in ward 47,
just like in the play.

20:18.607 --> 20:22.202
Everyone thought I was insane,
that I had killed someone.

20:22.287 --> 20:23.800
But it was all real.

20:24.807 --> 20:28.766
Deanna mentioned
that you were anxious about the play,

20:28.847 --> 20:30.963
but I had no idea.

20:33.527 --> 20:37.725
You said that in your dream,
we performed the play.

20:37.807 --> 20:39.081
How did it go?

20:39.167 --> 20:42.955
It was a smash.
We got a standing ovation.

20:43.047 --> 20:45.607
Let's hope it goes that well tonight.

20:45.687 --> 20:51.080
Well, we have one hour
before curtain. How are you feeling?

20:52.207 --> 20:54.118
I feel like an actor.

20:54.967 --> 20:58.721
Well, you're certainly beginning
to look the part.

20:58.807 --> 21:01.480
We should continue
this discussion next week.

21:01.567 --> 21:04.923
No. I wanna talk about this now.

21:05.007 --> 21:09.046
You're starting to sounding angry.
Maybe you need another treatment.

21:09.127 --> 21:13.166
What I need is to get out of
this cell! I've been here for days.

21:13.247 --> 21:17.081
You've controlled my every move.
Told me what to eat, think, say.

21:32.327 --> 21:35.239
When I show a glimmer
of independent thought...

21:39.367 --> 21:41.756
When I show a glimmer
of independent thought,

21:41.847 --> 21:45.760
you strap me down, inject me
with drugs and call it a treatment!

21:45.847 --> 21:49.999
- You're becoming agitated.
- You bet I'm agitated!

21:50.087 --> 21:53.363
I may be surrounded by insanity,
but I am not insane.

22:05.887 --> 22:07.320
What's happening?

22:11.567 --> 22:14.400
I can see we have
a lot of work to do.

22:18.727 --> 22:21.958
Nothing you can do will change
the fact that I'm innocent!

22:22.047 --> 22:23.480
I'm not crazy!

22:23.567 --> 22:25.080
I'm not...

22:27.567 --> 22:30.320
You're the key to all this,
aren't you?

22:33.007 --> 22:35.919
- Who are you?
- Lt Suna, sir.

22:36.007 --> 22:38.396
Will, are you alright?

22:42.927 --> 22:45.395
Yes. I don't know.

22:45.487 --> 22:47.717
Why don't we get him to sickbay?

22:54.567 --> 22:57.035
There's nothing wrong neurologically.

22:57.127 --> 23:00.563
I can't find anything
that could cause hallucinations.

23:00.647 --> 23:04.481
But your heart rate is up.
Your blood pressure is above normal.

23:04.567 --> 23:09.163
- You are physically exhausted.
- This is not simple fatigue.

23:09.247 --> 23:12.045
Will,
when you're under extreme stress,

23:12.127 --> 23:14.880
the mind can manufacture
all kinds of things.

23:14.967 --> 23:17.162
Drugs. They injected me with drugs.

23:17.247 --> 23:19.522
See if the drug's in my system.

23:22.567 --> 23:23.841
Nothing.

23:23.927 --> 23:26.566
In that dream, they gave me drugs.

23:26.647 --> 23:30.196
Didn't anyone else at the theatre
see anything strange happen?

23:30.287 --> 23:32.323
No. Nobody.

23:33.847 --> 23:37.965
Get some rest. The play is over.
Don't give it another thought.

23:38.047 --> 23:39.366
Right.

23:40.767 --> 23:43.884
- How's Lt Suna?
- Shaken, but alright.

23:43.967 --> 23:45.446
I feel like such an idiot.

23:45.527 --> 23:47.995
Don't be embarrassed.
We're your friends.

23:48.087 --> 23:50.555
We know the stress
you've been under.

23:50.647 --> 23:53.286
I'm sure everyone understands.

23:53.367 --> 23:57.201
Commander, I must congratulate you
on your performance.

23:57.287 --> 24:00.245
Your choice to improvise
was an effective method

24:00.327 --> 24:02.921
of drawing the audience
into your character.

24:03.007 --> 24:07.478
You gave a realistic interpretation
of multi-infarct dementia.

24:09.247 --> 24:10.726
Thank you.

24:10.807 --> 24:13.765
Well, maybe not everyone understands.

24:15.647 --> 24:19.686
I think I'd better get a little rest.
Clear my mind.

24:19.767 --> 24:22.361
I want you to try
some relaxation techniques.

24:22.447 --> 24:25.484
- Remember them?
- They never work for me.

24:25.567 --> 24:28.400
Maybe you need another treatment.

24:30.207 --> 24:31.640
What's wrong?

24:34.167 --> 24:35.646
Nothing.

24:35.927 --> 24:37.440
Nothing.

24:38.127 --> 24:42.120
Will, I want you to get some sleep.
I'll see you tomorrow.

24:43.247 --> 24:44.521
OK.

24:57.127 --> 24:58.765
It's not real.

24:58.847 --> 25:00.678
It's not real.

25:17.487 --> 25:19.717
Don't let them tell you you're crazy.

25:31.887 --> 25:33.240
No!

25:33.327 --> 25:36.160
Let me out of here!

25:36.487 --> 25:38.478
Let me out of here!

25:39.287 --> 25:41.005
Help me!

25:44.847 --> 25:46.360
Help me.

25:55.087 --> 25:56.645
I need help.

25:56.727 --> 26:00.322
I don't want to be at
the mercy of these hallucinations.

26:00.407 --> 26:03.956
You accept that you're not
from a starship? It's a delusion?

26:04.447 --> 26:09.282
All I know is, when I go back
to the ship, reality breaks apart.

26:09.367 --> 26:11.164
Nothing makes sense.

26:11.247 --> 26:13.966
When it's over,
it fades like a dream.

26:14.047 --> 26:17.244
But when I'm in the hospital,
everything seems real.

26:17.327 --> 26:19.966
I remember
everything that happens here.

26:20.047 --> 26:21.799
What about how you got here?

26:25.007 --> 26:27.680
Maybe I did kill someone.
I don't know.

26:28.927 --> 26:30.679
But I want to know how.

26:31.207 --> 26:33.277
I'm glad to hear you say that.

26:33.367 --> 26:36.564
I've had a talk
with the hospital administrator.

26:36.647 --> 26:40.959
He said there are legal questions
that have to be resolved soon.

26:41.047 --> 26:42.162
Meaning?

26:42.247 --> 26:44.966
Meaning we can't keep you here
much longer.

26:45.047 --> 26:48.005
We're the only mental-health
facility on Tilonus IV.

26:48.087 --> 26:50.317
We have many people who need help.

26:52.047 --> 26:54.607
I don't want to put stress on you,

26:54.687 --> 26:59.044
but we have to settle this case
one way or another within a few days.

26:59.127 --> 27:03.325
- What does that mean?
- You're facing a choice.

27:03.407 --> 27:07.241
We can help you remember what
happened using reflection therapy.

27:07.327 --> 27:10.717
If it's successful,
you'd be fit to stand trial.

27:10.807 --> 27:12.763
Reflection therapy?

27:12.847 --> 27:17.318
It's a way for you to interact with
various facets of your personality.

27:17.407 --> 27:21.400
We scan the regions of your brain
that control emotions and memory

27:21.487 --> 27:24.638
and project them holographically.

27:24.727 --> 27:26.445
What is the second option?

27:29.287 --> 27:33.326
A complete synaptic reconstruction
of your cerebral cortex.

27:34.487 --> 27:35.886
Surgery.

27:37.367 --> 27:39.961
We would neutralize
the synaptic pathways

27:40.047 --> 27:42.686
responsible
for your mental instability.

27:44.607 --> 27:47.201
It doesn't sound like
you care for that.

27:47.287 --> 27:51.246
I don't.
The procedure is irreversible.

27:51.327 --> 27:54.478
You'd be left with
a completely altered personality.

27:54.567 --> 27:57.127
The person you are now
would cease to exist.

27:59.967 --> 28:02.242
Option one
is beginning to sound better.

28:02.327 --> 28:03.919
I agree.

28:05.687 --> 28:08.281
Reflection therapy, then.
When do we begin?

28:08.927 --> 28:11.646
This afternoon, if you're ready.

28:12.007 --> 28:15.886
I want you to understand
that this won't be easy.

28:15.967 --> 28:18.435
You'll interact
with aspects of your psyche

28:18.527 --> 28:21.837
you've never dealt with before,
and...

28:21.927 --> 28:24.805
And you may be disturbed
by what they say.

28:38.927 --> 28:42.078
Close your eyes. Try to relax.

28:43.167 --> 28:45.078
Clear your mind.

28:47.727 --> 28:53.324
Now, think back
to before you came to the hospital.

28:54.927 --> 28:57.282
Don't try to remember
specific incidents.

28:57.367 --> 28:59.323
Concentrate on how you felt.

29:02.767 --> 29:04.280
I was afraid.

29:06.127 --> 29:09.164
- Terrified.
- She was with me on the ship.

29:09.247 --> 29:12.205
She represents
an aspect of your personality.

29:12.287 --> 29:16.360
There are parts of you that still
believe you're on that starship.

29:16.447 --> 29:19.678
- Why her?
- I asked you about your feelings.

29:19.767 --> 29:22.076
This is the part of you
that responded.

29:22.167 --> 29:25.125
Talk to her
about before you came here.

29:28.607 --> 29:32.202
You said I was terrified. Of what?

29:32.927 --> 29:35.680
I was in a dark place.

29:36.327 --> 29:39.478
Cold. Frightened.

29:40.007 --> 29:43.079
- Someone was there.
- Who?

29:43.887 --> 29:47.323
I felt threatened by them. Trapped.

29:47.407 --> 29:49.318
You're doing very well.

29:49.407 --> 29:52.524
Let's find out
how you responded to these feelings.

29:52.607 --> 29:54.484
Try to focus on your actions.

29:55.607 --> 29:57.757
You felt trapped. What did you do?

29:58.727 --> 30:01.764
I was angry.
They were attacking me.

30:01.847 --> 30:04.202
- I fought back.
- I felt pain.

30:04.287 --> 30:06.403
- I was injured.
- I panicked.

30:06.487 --> 30:09.797
There was a struggle and I...

30:09.887 --> 30:11.764
You what? What happened?

30:14.607 --> 30:19.078
Try to associate your actions
and emotions with logical thoughts.

30:19.167 --> 30:22.955
What do you think caused you
to act and feel this way?

30:24.167 --> 30:27.682
It was cold and dark because...

30:29.087 --> 30:33.239
..I was outdoors. At night.
I was in a narrow place.

30:33.327 --> 30:35.682
I was walking through an alley.

30:35.767 --> 30:38.486
- I felt threatened.
- I was being watched.

30:38.567 --> 30:42.640
Someone must have followed me
into the alley.

30:42.727 --> 30:45.082
That's why I started to walk faster.

30:45.167 --> 30:47.727
Someone grabbed me from behind.

30:47.807 --> 30:50.640
- I panicked.
- I tried to fight them off.

30:53.207 --> 30:55.641
- How many were there?
- Three.

30:55.727 --> 30:58.924
Humanoid. I only saw the face
of one of them.

30:59.007 --> 31:00.440
What did he look like?

31:03.767 --> 31:06.327
I saw him on the ship, too.

31:06.407 --> 31:10.525
I saw him in the hospital,
but I don't know who he is.

31:10.607 --> 31:13.280
That's Mr. Suna,
the hospital administrator.

31:13.367 --> 31:14.959
You met when you arrived.

31:16.087 --> 31:20.285
- What part of me does he represent?
- I don't know.

31:21.327 --> 31:24.637
Don't believe this, Will.
None of it's real.

31:24.727 --> 31:26.763
You're still on the Enterprise.

31:28.247 --> 31:30.442
- Doctor?
- We're your colleagues.

31:30.527 --> 31:34.236
You can trust us.
Everything will be alright.

31:35.687 --> 31:38.121
Do you have
anything to say to them?

31:44.207 --> 31:46.243
You're all delusions!

31:47.127 --> 31:49.322
Do not listen to him, Commander.

31:49.407 --> 31:53.116
He is trying to trick you.
You are in danger here.

31:53.567 --> 31:56.639
- Let us help you.
- Listen to me, Will.

31:56.727 --> 32:01.005
In all the years we've known
each other, have I ever lied?

32:02.247 --> 32:05.205
No. Please.

32:05.287 --> 32:09.200
- Leave me alone!
- Will, please.

32:09.767 --> 32:11.086
No!

32:18.327 --> 32:21.239
You've taken a big step today.

32:21.327 --> 32:25.081
You turned your back on those
delusions and all they represent.

32:27.527 --> 32:29.085
We'll continue later.

32:59.727 --> 33:01.160
It's not real.

33:06.767 --> 33:10.362
Commander. Do you know who I am?

33:15.687 --> 33:17.439
Do you know where you are?

33:20.127 --> 33:22.960
If you can't answer, just listen.

33:23.847 --> 33:28.045
You were on an undercover mission
to Tilonus IV. Something happened.

33:28.127 --> 33:32.325
We were told you killed somebody.
We do not believe it.

33:33.927 --> 33:35.997
We're being blocked at every turn.

33:36.087 --> 33:39.841
The hospital administrator
denies you're here at all.

33:39.927 --> 33:44.398
We're beginning to think
that there's some sort of conspiracy.

33:45.407 --> 33:48.126
I had to pose as a health official.

33:49.967 --> 33:53.721
Sit tight, Commander.
We will get you out of here.

34:01.367 --> 34:02.766
Not real.

34:28.687 --> 34:30.757
- Commander.
- Get away from me!

34:30.847 --> 34:33.485
Commander, come with us.
You are in danger.

34:33.567 --> 34:35.239
- No!
- Silence.

34:45.206 --> 34:47.482
Commander, are you alright?

34:47.567 --> 34:50.161
Help me! Help me!

35:08.087 --> 35:09.236
Who are you?

35:11.087 --> 35:12.805
Take them to Security.

35:29.607 --> 35:33.600
Worf to Enterprise. Pattern
enhancer activated. Three to beam up.

35:33.687 --> 35:35.200
Acknowledged.

35:41.767 --> 35:43.997
There's damage to the parietal lobe.

35:44.087 --> 35:47.682
It's as if someone's trying
to access his long-term memory.

35:47.767 --> 35:50.645
He's in a severe state
of neural shock.

35:50.727 --> 35:53.366
It's gonna take him a while
to recover.

35:54.727 --> 35:57.241
Number One,
do you remember what happened?

35:57.327 --> 36:00.524
You were abducted
during the mission to Tilonus IV

36:00.607 --> 36:03.075
and put into a psychiatric hospital.

36:11.727 --> 36:14.116
- It's still bleeding.
- It's minor.

36:15.927 --> 36:17.679
Don't worry about it.

36:20.967 --> 36:24.516
We have been checking
on the hospital administrator.

36:25.167 --> 36:26.566
Mr. Suna.

36:27.807 --> 36:31.482
It appears that he's involved
with one of the rival factions.

36:31.567 --> 36:35.640
We believe that he is responsible
for what happened to you.

36:37.727 --> 36:39.285
It still hurts.

36:42.087 --> 36:45.159
It's bleeding again.
Why? You just healed it!

36:45.687 --> 36:48.121
Will, try to calm down.

36:54.247 --> 36:55.999
This isn't real!

37:00.167 --> 37:01.441
What are you doing?

37:01.527 --> 37:04.678
If I'm right, you're not really here.

37:04.767 --> 37:06.359
This isn't a real phaser.

37:06.447 --> 37:08.165
It's all a fantasy.

37:09.087 --> 37:11.317
And I'll end it, no matter what.

37:11.407 --> 37:15.320
What if it isn't a fantasy?
Are you willing to take that chance?

37:15.407 --> 37:16.886
You're right.

37:17.687 --> 37:19.279
I won't.

37:21.087 --> 37:23.237
But I'll find out what's real.

37:23.327 --> 37:24.760
Will, don't!

37:28.007 --> 37:29.360
How's he progressing?

37:29.447 --> 37:32.484
He's not responding
to reflection therapy.

37:32.567 --> 37:35.127
His delusions
are growing more elaborate.

37:35.207 --> 37:36.959
He broke out of his cell.

37:37.047 --> 37:39.242
We found him running down a corridor,

37:39.327 --> 37:43.718
claiming people had come
to take him back to his starship.

37:43.807 --> 37:46.196
Then I see no other choice.

37:46.287 --> 37:49.324
We'll have to perform
the synaptic reconstruction.

37:49.407 --> 37:51.557
I still have a phaser. Why?

37:51.647 --> 37:56.118
It's not a phaser, it's a knife.
You stole it from a food tray.

37:56.207 --> 37:59.916
Give it to me.
We don't want you to hurt yourself.

38:04.567 --> 38:06.125
I don't believe you.

38:09.527 --> 38:13.566
- If this is a knife, where's Mavek?
- It's complicated.

38:13.647 --> 38:17.765
I'll answer all your questions.
But first, put that down.

38:17.847 --> 38:22.602
No. If this is a real phaser,
then I was on the Enterprise.

38:22.687 --> 38:26.123
But I fired it on myself,
so I should be dead.

38:28.367 --> 38:30.198
None of this is real.

38:34.487 --> 38:36.955
I'm setting this to level 16,
wide field.

38:37.047 --> 38:38.958
That should destroy this building.

38:39.047 --> 38:41.880
Unless, of course,
this isn't a real phaser.

38:57.887 --> 38:59.559
It's all about you.

38:59.647 --> 39:02.366
You're the only constant
in both places.

39:02.447 --> 39:06.201
There's a lot more going on here
than you realize.

39:07.167 --> 39:08.919
This isn't real, either.

39:10.247 --> 39:11.805
What's happening to me?

39:11.887 --> 39:13.718
Listen to me.

39:13.807 --> 39:17.595
We can still save you,
but you must stop fighting us.

39:24.087 --> 39:26.396
- You're lying!
- Let me help you.

39:26.487 --> 39:27.522
No!

39:29.527 --> 39:31.165
I'm warning you.

39:31.247 --> 39:32.236
No!

39:33.047 --> 39:34.400
Bravo!

39:35.807 --> 39:37.206
Bravo!

39:56.847 --> 39:58.121
He's conscious!

39:58.207 --> 40:01.597
I haven't finished the neurodrain.
Get him sedated!

40:07.607 --> 40:11.520
- Riker to Enterprise!
- Enterprise. Are you alright?

40:11.607 --> 40:14.644
Emergency transport.
Get me out of here.

40:23.927 --> 40:27.317
Captain's log, stardate 46778. 1.

40:27.407 --> 40:31.719
Cmdr Riker has returned safely
from his mission to Tilonus IV.

40:31.807 --> 40:35.800
Dr Crusher has repaired
the damage to his long-term memory.

40:35.887 --> 40:39.846
Evidently, you were abducted two
days after beaming to the surface.

40:39.927 --> 40:43.044
I remember now. I was in an alley.

40:43.127 --> 40:47.882
They attacked from behind. I tried
to fight them off with the nisroh.

40:47.967 --> 40:52.563
I managed to get one off me
but they injected me with a drug.

40:52.647 --> 40:56.640
We believe they tried to extract
information from your memory

40:56.727 --> 40:58.957
using a neurosomatic technique.

40:59.047 --> 41:02.005
I was in a hospital,
then on the Enterprise.

41:02.087 --> 41:05.523
I was back in the hospital,
shifting from place to place.

41:05.607 --> 41:07.757
I couldn't tell what was real.

41:07.847 --> 41:10.441
Your mind must have created
a defence mechanism

41:10.527 --> 41:13.599
that helped you resist
the neurosomatic process.

41:13.687 --> 41:17.441
Your unconscious fastened
on to elements of your real life

41:17.527 --> 41:20.087
in an attempt to keep you grounded.

41:20.167 --> 41:21.885
To keep you sane.

41:23.527 --> 41:26.678
The preparation for the mission,
the play.

41:27.967 --> 41:31.755
Those were recent memories,
fresh in my mind.

41:31.847 --> 41:34.884
You should rest.
We can talk tomorrow.

41:36.647 --> 41:39.286
There is one thing
I'd like to do first.

41:39.687 --> 41:42.440
Are you sure you want to do this
by yourself?

41:42.527 --> 41:44.961
The stage crew and I do it tomorrow.

41:45.047 --> 41:46.275
I'm positive.

41:46.367 --> 41:50.918
After everything, I couldn't sleep
knowing it was still up.

43:05.407 --> 43:06.396
