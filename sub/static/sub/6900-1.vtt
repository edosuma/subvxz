03:30.961 --> 03:32.230
North's dad:
You want to know how build a rocket

03:32.254 --> 03:34.336
and send a man into outer space,
don't come to me.

03:34.423 --> 03:35.817
North's mom: Don't even ask me about it.
You don't wanna know.

03:35.841 --> 03:37.944
North's dad: You're looking for someone
to perform a delicate brain operation,

03:37.968 --> 03:39.404
- I'm not your man.
- I don't wanna talk about it.

03:39.428 --> 03:41.614
North's dad: If, on the other hand,
you have any questions, whatsoever,

03:41.638 --> 03:43.754
regarding the quality of
a fine pair of pants,

03:43.849 --> 03:45.535
- look no further.
- Just thinking about it, I'm getting...

03:45.559 --> 03:48.346
Pants. That's what I know.
I know pants. All kinds of pants.

03:48.437 --> 03:49.997
I had a day. Let me tell you something.

03:50.021 --> 03:51.916
North's dad: So then he says to me,
"oh, yeah, what about chinos?"

03:51.940 --> 03:54.293
North's mom: As tough as it was for those
Hebrew slaves in ancient Egypt...

03:54.317 --> 03:55.837
- Dad.
- I said, "chinos? Yeah, I know chinos."

03:55.861 --> 03:57.442
- Mom?
- Those slaves were in Disneyland

03:57.529 --> 03:59.144
compared to working in a travel agency.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.525
- Dad?
- About jeans. Please! I grew up on jeans.

04:01.616 --> 04:02.677
- Mom?
- North's mom: You know,

04:02.701 --> 04:05.221
I'm sure being whipped while you're
building a pyramid's no bargain.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.848
Then he brings up overalls.
Now he's insulting me.

04:06.872 --> 04:09.409
North's mom: But those slaves
didn't have to book the himmelmans

04:09.499 --> 04:11.581
nonstop to boca during easter.

04:11.668 --> 04:13.604
North's dad: Einstein knew arithmetic,
Pavarotti knows singing,

04:13.628 --> 04:14.814
and I know pants.

04:14.838 --> 04:16.999
Narrator: North was positive
he was having a coronary.

04:17.089 --> 04:19.206
I said, "do you know who I am?"

04:19.301 --> 04:22.509
Narrator: Now, as a rule, 11-year-olds
don't experience cardiac events.

04:22.596 --> 04:25.429
"Well, in case you forgot,
let me remind you who I am."

04:25.515 --> 04:28.052
Narrator: But for north,
this was a very stressful time.

04:28.143 --> 04:30.259
"I'm number 6!"

04:30.353 --> 04:32.707
Narrator: Yes. North was having
a difficult time with his folks.

04:32.731 --> 04:34.125
- Dad!
- And it was putting a damper on

04:34.149 --> 04:37.391
what was, in all other respects,
a very successful life.

04:38.069 --> 04:39.309
How successful?

04:39.404 --> 04:40.769
Well, look at the year he'd had.

04:40.864 --> 04:42.320
Photosynthesis.

04:42.407 --> 04:44.614
The process by which
carbohydrates are formed

04:44.701 --> 04:47.033
in the chlorophyll
containing tissues of plants

04:47.120 --> 04:48.360
exposed to sunlight.

04:56.963 --> 04:58.669
/f I were a rich man

04:58.757 --> 05:02.466
diguh, diguh, diguh, diguh
diguh, diguh, diguh, diguh, dum

05:03.053 --> 05:06.170
all day long I'd biddy-biddy bum

05:06.515 --> 05:12.385
if I were a wealthy man

05:15.857 --> 05:16.857
hey!

05:16.942 --> 05:18.478
Man: Bravo!

05:18.568 --> 05:21.025
Narrator: An outstanding year
by anyone's standards.

05:21.112 --> 05:24.024
But did north's folks
appreciate how special he was?

05:24.115 --> 05:25.321
- Hardly.
- Dad?

05:25.408 --> 05:26.989
"You hear me? I'm number 6.

05:27.077 --> 05:29.514
"And I was inspecting pants
before you even started wearing them,

05:29.538 --> 05:32.325
"Mr. vice president only because
your father owns the company."

05:32.415 --> 05:33.476
- Mom...
North's mom: God forbid the himmelmans

05:33.500 --> 05:35.645
should stop over in Atlanta.
Like that would kill them.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.730
I said, "I forgot more about belt loops
than you'll ever know."

05:37.754 --> 05:39.961
You see this rash? You see it? Hhmmelman.

05:40.048 --> 05:41.484
- There's no ointment for this. None.
- Dad!

05:41.508 --> 05:43.236
North's dad: I said, "let me remind you
who you're talking to.

05:43.260 --> 05:48.129
"Only this year's recipient
of the coveted Mr. inseam award."

05:48.223 --> 05:49.679
Well, that shut him up.

05:52.561 --> 05:55.678
Dad. You know what that
stupid Rachel did to me today?

05:56.189 --> 05:57.869
I saw some blood in my stool this morning.

06:00.819 --> 06:02.025
- North's mom: North?
- North?

06:02.112 --> 06:04.148
- Are you okay?
- What's the matter, son?

06:04.281 --> 06:05.771
Here, loosen his pants.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.027
No, no, I'm okay.

06:08.118 --> 06:10.074
I'm all right. I'm all right.

06:10.829 --> 06:12.035
I'm okay.

06:12.122 --> 06:13.828
Narrator: But north wasn't okay.

06:13.915 --> 06:17.078
This parent thing was starting to
affect every aspect of his life.

06:19.087 --> 06:20.998
Girl: It's turning into the wind.

06:21.089 --> 06:23.296
- What sense does that make?
- It's not, uh...

06:23.592 --> 06:26.129
Maybe it's supposed to show us
where the wind was.

06:26.303 --> 06:28.794
What are we supposed to do
with that information?

06:29.764 --> 06:31.174
To be,

06:31.266 --> 06:32.802
or not to...

06:33.894 --> 06:35.054
Line?

06:35.145 --> 06:36.635
Eti === s a

06:36.730 --> 06:37.970
be.

06:41.484 --> 06:43.975
- Ball 4.
- That's six in a row.

06:44.654 --> 06:45.939
Time out.

06:49.492 --> 06:50.652
How you doing?

06:50.994 --> 06:52.234
I don't get it.

06:52.996 --> 06:55.408
A child is born, he's given a life,

06:56.166 --> 07:00.751
but then, he's appreciated by everyone
except the folks who gave him that life.

07:01.796 --> 07:03.411
It's just not right.

07:03.673 --> 07:06.836
Uh, let me rephrase the question.
How's the arm?

07:07.844 --> 07:11.336
Mr. blankman, I've got some problems
that I have to work out.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.505
Problems? You?

07:13.934 --> 07:15.014
North?

07:18.605 --> 07:22.018
Narrator: So, while everyone speculated
as to what could possibly be bothering

07:22.108 --> 07:24.269
last season's most valuable player,

07:24.361 --> 07:28.024
north left the field
and headed straight for his secret spot.

07:29.866 --> 07:32.448
Yes, north had a secret spot.

07:34.496 --> 07:36.782
You know the kind of
spot I'm talking about.

07:36.873 --> 07:41.537
A place that's just ordinary to everyone else
but for some reason is special only to you.

07:42.337 --> 07:44.123
Because no matter where it is,

07:44.214 --> 07:45.670
this is the spot where you can go

07:45.757 --> 07:48.669
and feel that you're away
from everyone and everything.

07:48.760 --> 07:51.467
The spot where you can go
and do your best thinking.

07:51.554 --> 07:55.092
The one place where you can go
to reflect upon what was,

07:55.392 --> 07:57.132
mull over what is,

07:57.686 --> 07:59.972
or just sit back, close your eyes,

08:00.063 --> 08:02.896
and change the world
into whatever you wish it could be.

08:04.401 --> 08:06.441
Now, it's my guess
that even north couldn't remember

08:06.528 --> 08:09.395
when his spot first revealed
its special powers to him,

08:09.948 --> 08:12.064
nor did it even matter at this point.

08:12.742 --> 08:14.232
What was important was

08:14.327 --> 08:16.534
whenever he sat in that huge armchair,

08:16.830 --> 08:18.320
he looked like any other kid

08:18.415 --> 08:21.248
just waiting for his parents
to finish their easter shopping.

08:21.751 --> 08:25.243
And he was sitting on that very spot
the first time I saw him.

08:25.797 --> 08:27.207
Why don't they like me?

08:28.383 --> 08:29.919
What did I do wrong?

08:32.761 --> 08:34.092
You okay, kid?

08:35.472 --> 08:36.508
Yeah.

08:36.599 --> 08:41.514
Good, 'cause I only got a 10-minute break,
and my back is killing me.

08:41.604 --> 08:44.471
The last thing I need
is to listen to somebody else's problems.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.274
You hungry?

08:49.112 --> 08:50.227
No, thanks.

08:50.321 --> 08:53.313
Good, 'cause I'm starving,
and this is my last carrot.

08:59.122 --> 09:01.158
So, who are you?

09:01.708 --> 09:02.743
I'm north.

09:03.084 --> 09:04.824
Seen your name on maps.

09:04.919 --> 09:05.954
Very impressive.

09:06.504 --> 09:07.584
Who are you?

09:07.672 --> 09:10.084
I'm the easter bunny. Third floor, toys.

09:10.383 --> 09:11.383
Ah.

09:11.468 --> 09:12.924
At least until Sunday, that is.

09:13.011 --> 09:14.251
And then what do you do?

09:14.596 --> 09:16.211
Whatever I want.

09:16.306 --> 09:18.422
Independently wealthy.

09:18.516 --> 09:21.098
4th of July, I might be uncle Sam.

09:21.186 --> 09:23.472
Christmas, maybe Santa claus.

09:24.022 --> 09:25.262
My life's a holiday.

09:25.607 --> 09:28.144
- How about yours?
- Not lately.

09:28.234 --> 09:29.974
I had a real bad game today.

09:30.528 --> 09:31.608
How bad?

09:32.363 --> 09:36.652
I walked nine panthers
and hit my coach's wife with a wild pitch.

09:37.327 --> 09:38.658
That's bad.

09:39.162 --> 09:40.642
What? You got something on your mind?

09:42.457 --> 09:43.492
Well?

09:44.209 --> 09:45.244
What is it?

09:45.335 --> 09:47.917
I thought you didn't wanna hear
anyone else's problems.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.329
You always believe
everything a stranger tells you?

09:50.423 --> 09:51.754
Come on, spill.

09:52.217 --> 09:54.833
- Nah, you wouldn't understand.
- Try me.

09:56.262 --> 09:57.672
It's my folks.

09:58.014 --> 09:59.879
Yeah, what about them?

10:00.433 --> 10:03.721
I don't know.
All they care about is themselves.

10:04.312 --> 10:04.596
Selfish folks.

10:04.604 --> 10:05.604
Selfish folks.

10:06.272 --> 10:07.432
That is rough.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.890
They don't know what a good thing
they got in you, right?

10:10.985 --> 10:13.943
Exactly, and they're the only ones.

10:14.364 --> 10:17.026
You should hear what all the other parents
say about me.

10:17.659 --> 10:20.025
North's room is always clean.

10:22.705 --> 10:24.991
North always looks both ways.

10:27.752 --> 10:30.084
North never spoils his appetite.

10:33.550 --> 10:35.040
North flosses.

10:36.553 --> 10:39.420
Holy mackerel.
Your folks are sitting on a gold mine.

10:39.764 --> 10:40.970
Tell me about it.

10:41.891 --> 10:43.882
You realize, of course,
that you're not alone.

10:44.769 --> 10:45.804
What do you mean?

10:46.396 --> 10:48.557
Look, kid, just because I'm in a bunny suit

10:48.648 --> 10:51.515
doesn't mean I haven't stumbled across
a basic truth now and then.

10:51.609 --> 10:53.565
The feeling of being
insufficiently appreciated

10:53.653 --> 10:55.063
is a common childhood lament.

10:55.488 --> 10:58.070
- I'm not common.
- 'Course you're not,

10:58.158 --> 11:01.491
but I'll bet you that even
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,

11:01.578 --> 11:03.578
who wrote a symphony
by the age of three, mind you,

11:03.663 --> 11:06.154
had more than a few evenings then
with an angry parent yelling,

11:06.249 --> 11:09.161
"stop banging on that damn piano
and go to bed, Mozart."

11:09.252 --> 11:13.086
Yeah. Fine.
But Mr. Mozart's dead, and I'm alive.

11:13.173 --> 11:16.461
So I'll bet you that right now
I'm in a lot more pain than he is.

11:16.926 --> 11:18.507
Hard to argue with that one.

11:19.095 --> 11:22.633
At this point,
I'd even settle for Mozart's parents.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.051
Well,

11:24.434 --> 11:27.016
unfortunately, you don't
get to make that choice, kid.

11:27.103 --> 11:30.812
The one thing that we cannot control
in this life is who our parents are.

11:30.899 --> 11:32.685
You're dealt a hand, you're stuck with it.

11:32.775 --> 11:35.671
It's not like baseball, where if you don't
like the deal you have with one team,

11:35.695 --> 11:38.655
you can become a free agent and try to
get a better deal with another team.

11:39.574 --> 11:40.939
Another team.

11:41.451 --> 11:42.782
This is real life, kid.

11:43.161 --> 11:44.742
The rules are different.

11:44.829 --> 11:46.945
Listen, I gotta get back upstairs.

11:47.790 --> 11:51.123
If you want my advice,
and I know you didn't ask for it,

11:51.377 --> 11:54.494
go home, make up, and goodbye.

11:55.632 --> 11:56.872
Narrator: And that was it.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.001
Nothing special.

11:58.801 --> 12:01.292
I just left him there in
that secret spot of his.

12:01.846 --> 12:04.428
Just him and his thoughts.

12:05.433 --> 12:07.173
Free agency.

12:07.602 --> 12:08.762
What a scoop!

12:08.853 --> 12:10.389
A kid becoming a free agent,

12:10.480 --> 12:12.971
then going around
offering his services as a devoted son

12:13.066 --> 12:14.727
to the highest-bidding set of parents.

12:15.026 --> 12:16.641
It's brilliant, north!

12:17.654 --> 12:19.235
Simply brilliant!

12:19.322 --> 12:21.608
- Look. This still isn't for sure yet.
- No?

12:21.699 --> 12:22.939
This could be my Watergate.

12:23.034 --> 12:26.777
Winchell, you put out a two-page leaflet
with a circulation of 90.

12:26.871 --> 12:28.577
Might even land me a pulitzer.

12:28.665 --> 12:31.452
Hey, I told you this idea
because you're my friend,

12:31.542 --> 12:33.703
not because you're editor
of the school newspaper.

12:33.795 --> 12:35.706
- I'm a journalist, north.
- So?

12:36.047 --> 12:39.084
So you never said
this conversation was off the record.

12:39.175 --> 12:42.258
- Winchell, I need time to think.
- All right. All right.

12:42.345 --> 12:43.425
I'll hold the story,

12:43.513 --> 12:46.129
but, north, a few more displays
like that panther game,

12:46.224 --> 12:50.467
and some of the more attractive parents
may start doing some thinking of their own.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.389
That damn panther game.

12:52.522 --> 12:55.309
And, north,
that geography test we took today?

12:55.441 --> 12:56.681
What about it?

13:03.741 --> 13:05.652
- You got a 34.
- Huh?

13:05.743 --> 13:07.404
Chicago's in Africa?

13:07.537 --> 13:10.279
Mexico is an island off
the coast of Montana?

13:10.748 --> 13:12.955
- Where'd you get this?
- I'm a journalist, north.

13:13.042 --> 13:14.452
I can't reveal my sources.

13:14.544 --> 13:17.536
Besides, how I got this
test is not important.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.916
But why you got this grade is.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.172
Your instincts are correct, old buddy.

13:22.260 --> 13:24.967
You need new parents,
and you need them now.

13:25.221 --> 13:27.052
- Unless...
- Unless what?

13:27.140 --> 13:29.260
Unless you haven't got the guts
to go through with it.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.971
Winchell, I've got more guts
than anybody in this town.

13:32.061 --> 13:34.723
- And you know it!
- Eh, talk is cheap.

13:36.357 --> 13:39.895
I just feel that I owe it to my parents
to give them one last chance.

13:40.445 --> 13:41.730
What can I say?

13:41.863 --> 13:44.104
You came to me, you sought my counsel.

13:44.699 --> 13:46.235
The rest is up to you.

13:52.248 --> 13:53.909
No, no, that's okay.

13:54.375 --> 13:55.615
Thanks, anyway.

13:56.085 --> 13:58.230
Narrator: Yes. North wanted
to give his folks every chance

13:58.254 --> 14:00.165
to keep the family together.

14:00.256 --> 14:01.621
He tried to reach his mom,

14:01.716 --> 14:04.253
but she was too busy
rerouting the himmelmans.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.629
That left dad.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.256
Pants. Can I help you?

14:07.347 --> 14:10.214
Hello. My name is north.
Can I talk to my dad?

14:10.308 --> 14:12.344
- What number?
- Number 6.

14:14.103 --> 14:17.015
Man: Looks like that
5-iron's a little short...

14:19.609 --> 14:20.849
Number 6.

14:22.070 --> 14:24.186
Number 6! Yeah.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.611
Phone call for you.

14:25.740 --> 14:27.150
Oh, uh, prom season.

14:27.241 --> 14:28.981
- Get a number, would you?
- It's your son.

14:29.077 --> 14:31.443
Oh... all right. Just a minute.

14:31.537 --> 14:34.745
- Is that piping holding up?
- Very well, Mr. vice president.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.457
Now he's an expert on piping.

14:41.464 --> 14:44.797
- Hello.
- Hello, dad, can I talk to you for a minute?

14:45.385 --> 14:47.842
- Yes, north.
- We need these by 5:00.

14:50.473 --> 14:52.589
I only got two legs here!

14:52.683 --> 14:55.720
North, I'm swamped.
Could we discuss this over dinner, son?

14:55.812 --> 14:56.812
But, dad...

14:56.896 --> 14:58.932
All right. We'll discuss it over dinner.

14:59.941 --> 15:01.647
Yeah, right. Dinner.

15:03.653 --> 15:05.609
Well, that's that.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.652
Okay, guys, let's roll.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.738
- Zoe, you take the south side.
- See you.

15:16.833 --> 15:18.289
Adam... winchell!

15:18.376 --> 15:19.411
Winchell!

15:19.502 --> 15:20.912
- Winchell!
- Here you go.

15:21.003 --> 15:23.210
- Here you go.
- I've made my decision.

15:23.297 --> 15:24.833
Don't tell me. Let me guess.

15:26.384 --> 15:27.669
North: How did you know?

15:27.760 --> 15:29.296
News travels fast.

15:29.387 --> 15:30.422
Apparently.

15:30.513 --> 15:32.113
I'm proud of you, kid. You got a lawyer?

15:32.140 --> 15:33.300
Why? Do I need one?

15:33.391 --> 15:35.006
North, this is America.

15:35.101 --> 15:36.432
Everyone needs a lawyer.

15:36.519 --> 15:38.475
Lucky for you, I happen to know the best.

15:38.563 --> 15:40.599
Name's Arthur belt.
He's done some work for me.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.430
Pro bono. Let's move it.

15:42.525 --> 15:45.733
- Where will I find this Arthur belt?
- Don't worry. He'll find you.

15:45.820 --> 15:48.357
Come on. We got a paper to get out!

16:06.048 --> 16:08.664
Hello, north. Arthur belt at your service.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.049
The lawyer?

16:12.346 --> 16:13.426
Your lawyer.

16:13.514 --> 16:15.129
From now on, we are a team.

16:15.224 --> 16:16.368
You do what I tell you to do,

16:16.392 --> 16:18.120
you say what I tell you to say,
before you know it

16:18.144 --> 16:19.705
you're gonna have
the best parents in the world.

16:19.729 --> 16:20.764
What do you say, kid?

16:22.023 --> 16:23.888
You sure you can squeeze me in?

16:23.983 --> 16:25.018
What?

16:25.318 --> 16:28.401
Oh, the ambulance chasing thing.

16:29.614 --> 16:32.356
That's nothing.
I just use it to beat the traffic.

16:32.450 --> 16:35.090
You should try it sometime on your bike.
Now, what do you say, kid?

16:35.161 --> 16:38.028
- Are we a team?
- Yeah, I guess so.

16:38.539 --> 16:40.621
Hey, hey, hey. You know so.

16:42.293 --> 16:44.438
Narrator: Yes, north was actually
going to go through with it

16:44.462 --> 16:47.454
and challenge the entire concept of family
as we know it.

16:48.591 --> 16:51.503
And the effect was immediate,
as kids now faced their parents

16:51.594 --> 16:54.381
with a confidence they once
could only dream about.

16:54.472 --> 16:56.633
What a great idea. North is a genius.

16:56.724 --> 16:58.430
Jeffrey, don't be ridiculous.

16:59.435 --> 17:02.677
Now, where did I put that phone number
for Arthur belt?

17:02.772 --> 17:04.057
Did I say "ridiculous"?

17:04.147 --> 17:07.140
What I meant to say was,
you look very handsome today, Jeffrey.

17:07.276 --> 17:10.018
You realize north will never pull this off?

17:10.112 --> 17:12.194
He's north. He can do anything.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.237
Come on, Andy, his folks
are gonna fight it.

17:14.325 --> 17:17.112
Of course, they are.
They're not gonna take this lying down.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.656
Narrator:
And then the media circus began.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.244
How do you feel about this?

17:25.711 --> 17:27.121
Is winchell's story accurate?

17:28.506 --> 17:29.996
Can we take that as a "yes"?

17:31.092 --> 17:32.957
North, you think you can pull this off?

17:33.302 --> 17:34.712
No comment.

17:35.179 --> 17:38.922
North, if you are successful,
how will your actions affect mother's day?

17:39.350 --> 17:41.306
No comment!

17:41.602 --> 17:44.935
In 1793, the cotton gin was invented.

17:45.106 --> 17:48.439
North, could you please tell us
the name of the inventor?

17:48.526 --> 17:49.526
E

17:52.029 --> 17:53.064
Okay.

17:53.155 --> 17:56.943
Under strict advice from counsel,
I must respectfully say no comment.

17:57.994 --> 18:02.078
Narrator: Finally, north's day in court
arrived and the world was watching.

18:02.832 --> 18:05.164
All rise for the honorable judge buckle.

18:08.713 --> 18:10.920
All sit for the honorable judge buckle.

18:25.521 --> 18:29.855
Now, then, let me remind you,
this is a trial, this is not a hearing.

18:30.693 --> 18:33.297
Even though both sides will be
saying things, and I'll be hearing them,

18:33.321 --> 18:34.777
it is still not a hearing.

18:35.031 --> 18:38.615
No doubt you'll all be hearing
the same things that I am hearing.

18:38.701 --> 18:40.032
That's your privilege.

18:40.453 --> 18:45.447
However, once both sides have been heard,
then it'll be my job to pass judgment.

18:45.541 --> 18:48.704
Obviously, you can all pass judgment, too,
but it won't count.

18:48.794 --> 18:51.285
That's because I'm the
one who is the judge.

18:51.380 --> 18:53.291
Have I made myself clear to the plaintiff?

18:53.549 --> 18:56.962
Yes, your honor,
it is quite clear to the plaintiff.

18:57.053 --> 18:59.260
Very good.
Have I made myself clear to the defense?

18:59.597 --> 19:02.259
Your honor, the defense rests.

19:02.975 --> 19:05.591
Then there's nothing left to do
but make my judgment,

19:05.686 --> 19:09.895
and in my judgment, any folks
who would sleep through a trial like this

19:09.982 --> 19:13.691
are folks who don't deserve to have
a wonderful, upstanding son like north!

19:13.778 --> 19:15.818
I rule in favor of the plaintiff.

19:15.905 --> 19:17.020
Yes!

19:17.907 --> 19:19.772
Yes! Yes!

19:19.867 --> 19:22.108
The system works. North, you're a free man.

19:24.914 --> 19:26.120
Hold on.

19:26.248 --> 19:27.248
Hold on.

19:27.333 --> 19:30.666
Israel was in Egypt land
let my people go

19:30.753 --> 19:32.493
- judge: Hold it. Hold it down.
- Everybody!

19:32.588 --> 19:33.623
Go down, Moses

19:33.714 --> 19:34.920
judge: Hey! Hey!

19:37.218 --> 19:38.674
Go down, Moses

19:39.011 --> 19:40.876
hey! This is a court of law.

19:40.971 --> 19:41.971
Whoa!

19:43.516 --> 19:45.952
Judge: Even though I have made
a judgment, the trial is not over.

19:45.976 --> 19:47.261
I still have to make a ruling.

19:47.937 --> 19:50.895
Now, then, today is...

19:52.441 --> 19:53.931
Clerk: July 1st.

19:54.026 --> 19:56.017
Today is July 1st,

19:56.112 --> 19:59.525
and it is my ruling that north
choose his new parents by labor day,

19:59.615 --> 20:01.606
so he can begin school with his new family.

20:01.909 --> 20:03.319
If he does not choose new parents,

20:03.411 --> 20:06.244
he has the option
of returning to his original parents.

20:06.330 --> 20:07.536
However,

20:07.623 --> 20:09.204
if he is not physically in the arms

20:09.208 --> 20:09.697
if he is not physically in the arms

20:09.792 --> 20:12.579
of either his new parents
or his original parents

20:12.670 --> 20:14.160
by noon on labor day,

20:14.255 --> 20:16.416
he will be remanded to an orphanage.

20:17.133 --> 20:21.092
And if any of you has ever
seen the little rascals...

20:21.178 --> 20:22.884
You know that's no day at the beach.

20:23.848 --> 20:25.679
- Orphanage?
- Not to worry.

20:25.808 --> 20:28.595
I'm telling you, kid,
from now own, the world is your oyster.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.852
Narrator: Even though north
didn't really care for oysters,

20:31.939 --> 20:35.056
he couldn't help but take Arthur bell's
enthusiasm as a positive sign.

20:35.151 --> 20:36.545
Woman: North free agent draft.
Good morning.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.480
North free agent draft. Good morning.

20:38.904 --> 20:40.144
Yes, his eyes are blue.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.399
Soprano.

20:41.699 --> 20:43.189
Super Mario 3.

20:43.284 --> 20:44.364
The backstroke.

20:44.452 --> 20:46.317
Yes. He believes in god and evolution.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.778
Don't even get him started
on the Warren commission.

20:51.917 --> 20:54.124
Oh, everyone wants you, kid. Everyone.

20:54.503 --> 20:55.618
Look at this.

20:56.046 --> 20:59.334
You got a first class ticket
to every city in the world.

20:59.425 --> 21:02.337
I have to advise you,
don't spread yourself too thin.

21:02.428 --> 21:05.782
It's important you learn as much as you can
about each set of parents that you audition.

21:05.806 --> 21:08.593
Because once you sign with someone,
that's it.

21:08.684 --> 21:10.495
They are your new folks forever.
You understand?

21:10.519 --> 21:11.679
You bet.

21:11.771 --> 21:14.183
That's the spirit. Let's get cracking.

21:23.032 --> 21:25.614
Narrator: So, north was on his way.

21:25.701 --> 21:27.441
It was the 4th of July, and this year,

21:27.536 --> 21:30.448
independence day
had a special meaning for north.

21:30.539 --> 21:31.745
He was a free man,

21:31.832 --> 21:35.370
and on his way to search out the life
he felt he so richly deserved.

21:58.067 --> 21:59.978
- There he is.
- Oh, look at that boy!

22:00.069 --> 22:01.069
There he is, pa.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.687
Well, hey, howdy, north.

22:04.907 --> 22:07.364
- I'm pa Tex, this here's ma Tex.
- Howdy.

22:07.451 --> 22:09.863
And welcome to the great state of Texas.

22:09.954 --> 22:11.194
Uh, howdy.

22:19.338 --> 22:20.999
I know what you're thinking.

22:21.382 --> 22:22.713
Big car, right?

22:23.467 --> 22:25.458
Well, it did cross my mind.

22:26.011 --> 22:29.174
Everything I own is the
biggest and the best.

22:29.265 --> 22:33.224
- That's why we'd like you to become our son.
- 'Cause you're the best.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.601
To the best.

22:48.242 --> 22:49.573
Ma Tex: Home, sweet home.

22:51.537 --> 22:53.619
Pa Tex: This can all be yours, son.

22:54.164 --> 22:59.375
The main house, guest house,
livestock, oil Wells.

23:00.087 --> 23:03.045
- Rumor has it you like baseball.
- It's my favorite.

23:03.132 --> 23:05.088
You know, I used to own the Houston astros.

23:05.175 --> 23:06.711
Really? What happened?

23:06.802 --> 23:09.794
Just this morning, I
signed them over to you.

23:09.889 --> 23:11.095
Gee, don't get me wrong.

23:11.181 --> 23:15.299
They're a fine organization,
but aren't we rushing things just a little?

23:21.525 --> 23:23.356
Pretty fair shooting there, Gabby.

23:23.569 --> 23:24.979
Thanks, boss.

23:26.572 --> 23:27.778
Hey.

23:28.324 --> 23:29.655
What are you doing here?

23:30.326 --> 23:33.489
I finished up all my chores.
I figured I'd get a little shooting in.

23:33.996 --> 23:35.327
No, I mean...

23:35.831 --> 23:37.617
Have you ever been an easter bunny?

23:38.709 --> 23:40.825
- Easter bunny?
- Pa Tex: Careful, son.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.377
- Gabby's killed men for less than that.
- Oh.

23:44.214 --> 23:45.420
Sorry.

23:46.717 --> 23:48.082
No harm done.

23:56.727 --> 23:59.935
So, what you two cowpokes
got planned for tomorrow?

24:00.022 --> 24:04.766
Well, I reckon, we'll wake up early and
eat, then we'll dig for oil and eat,

24:04.860 --> 24:07.397
then we'll rope some doggies
and bust a few broncs,

24:07.488 --> 24:09.353
and then maybe we'll grab a bite to eat.

24:09.657 --> 24:11.363
You like Tex-mex?

24:11.575 --> 24:14.612
Sure. I'm a huge fan
of any food that straddles two borders.

24:15.079 --> 24:16.694
That's my boy.

24:16.789 --> 24:19.952
But, uh, can I ask you what the deal is
with all this eating?

24:20.042 --> 24:21.157
Oh, simple.

24:21.251 --> 24:25.335
Remember before when I told you everything
I own is the biggest and the best?

24:25.422 --> 24:26.832
Well, you're already the best.

24:26.924 --> 24:29.256
Now, there's nothing left
but to make you the biggest.

24:29.551 --> 24:32.258
And don't fret about
not being able to clean up your plate.

24:32.346 --> 24:35.804
Why, pretty soon that stomach of yours
will stretch and stretch,

24:35.891 --> 24:38.598
and your capacity for food
will just grow and grow.

24:40.104 --> 24:41.184
Excuse me.

24:41.271 --> 24:44.229
You say that like that's a good thing
to have happen to your stomach.

24:44.316 --> 24:45.522
It is.

24:45.818 --> 24:46.853
Why?

24:46.944 --> 24:49.060
Well, then you'll be like buck.

24:49.405 --> 24:51.646
- Who?
- Our first son.

24:51.740 --> 24:54.072
Biggest boy this big state's ever seen.

24:54.159 --> 24:58.448
Why, he could eat more in one day than
anyone else could eat in a whole month.

24:58.956 --> 25:00.867
That's why buck hated February.

25:04.586 --> 25:05.746
Where is buck?

25:06.130 --> 25:07.870
He died in a stampede.

25:08.841 --> 25:09.841
Oh.

25:10.134 --> 25:11.499
I'm so sorry.

25:11.593 --> 25:13.925
Needless to say, it was a mighty big loss.

25:14.847 --> 25:17.450
Yeah, but now, we'd like to show you
how much we're looking forward

25:17.474 --> 25:19.840
to having you as our new son.

25:19.935 --> 25:21.015
Ready, pa?

25:21.103 --> 25:22.263
Ready, ma.

25:22.563 --> 25:26.021
We had a son who was trampled
by a ton of longhorns

25:26.108 --> 25:29.475
but you're here, cutes, to fill his boots
as flat as they may be

25:29.570 --> 25:33.279
you'll yell yippee-ai-o
at the rodeo till the day's done

25:33.365 --> 25:35.245
then you'll make a lot of pals
with buffalo gals

25:35.284 --> 25:37.070
- just leave some for me
- Hey, there!

25:37.161 --> 25:38.992
We'll barbecue steaks and stew

25:39.079 --> 25:40.910
feed you pumpkin pie

25:40.998 --> 25:44.365
till your can's bigger than
the big ole Texas sky

25:44.460 --> 25:45.791
yee-hah!

25:47.379 --> 25:48.459
Yee-hah!

25:51.300 --> 25:52.756
Yee-hah!

25:54.762 --> 25:55.968
Yee-hah!

26:01.977 --> 26:02.977
Whoo!

26:06.690 --> 26:10.148
You'll grow tall and
play football, be famous

26:10.235 --> 26:13.602
you'll grow more, own a chain of stores
marry Betty Lou

26:13.697 --> 26:16.655
oh, north, north

26:16.742 --> 26:20.655
grow, north

26:21.371 --> 26:22.861
another rib, son?

26:38.222 --> 26:39.712
You okay, cowboy?

26:40.265 --> 26:42.677
Yeah. Just thinking.

26:45.020 --> 26:47.636
Texas nights are sure good for thinking.

26:49.358 --> 26:50.814
Yeah.

26:56.990 --> 27:00.983
You doing any particular type of thinking
or just wondering thinking?

27:01.870 --> 27:03.861
I was thinking if I stay here,

27:04.498 --> 27:07.205
I'll always be living
in the shadow of someone else.

27:07.835 --> 27:09.325
What kind of life would that be?

27:10.045 --> 27:13.253
From what I hear about buck,
what kind of shadow would that be?

27:14.049 --> 27:15.880
Yeah, he was a big one.

27:19.721 --> 27:21.302
Mighty hard being your own man

27:21.390 --> 27:23.426
when they're always comparing you
to somebody else.

27:24.393 --> 27:26.099
Yeah, right.

27:26.895 --> 27:31.059
I mean, I left home because I had parents
who didn't appreciate who I was.

27:31.441 --> 27:33.306
So why would I want to be with new parents

27:33.402 --> 27:35.893
who could only appreciate me
if I was someone else?

27:37.531 --> 27:39.738
You might be onto something there, son.

27:40.951 --> 27:43.784
You know, down here in these parts
we got a saying.

27:44.913 --> 27:50.954
Sometimes when you're panning for gold,
you got to try more than one stream.

27:57.259 --> 27:58.840
We really wish you'd reconsider.

27:58.927 --> 28:01.760
I'm sorry, but it wouldn't
be fair to any of us.

28:02.431 --> 28:04.342
Thanks for the opportunity, north.

28:04.433 --> 28:05.639
Oh, sir?

28:06.018 --> 28:07.224
Yes, north?

28:08.187 --> 28:10.974
I think it's only right
that I give you back the astros.

28:12.316 --> 28:15.149
Well, thanks, son. That's a class gesture.

28:15.944 --> 28:17.900
Well, goodbye.

28:18.780 --> 28:21.317
- So long, pard.
- We'll miss you.

28:21.408 --> 28:22.693
Hold on there, son.

28:34.296 --> 28:36.958
Just a little something
to remember your old buddy Gabby by.

28:37.925 --> 28:39.290
Hope it brings you good luck.

28:40.302 --> 28:41.417
Thanks.

28:44.723 --> 28:47.886
Narrator: So, north resumed his search,

28:47.976 --> 28:52.390
and though he got to the airport by noon,
out of respect for ma and pa Tex,

28:52.481 --> 28:54.221
in true cowboy tradition,

28:54.316 --> 28:57.729
he chose to wait eight hours
so he could fly off into the sunset,

28:57.819 --> 29:00.982
with no knowledge at all
of what was going on back home.

29:01.323 --> 29:04.065
Winchell: How much longer
do we have to put up with this indignity?

29:04.159 --> 29:05.159
Boy: Yeah!

29:05.202 --> 29:07.944
Winchell: How much longer
must we tolerate these injustices?

29:08.038 --> 29:10.120
- The subservience?
- Boy 2: Yeah!

29:10.207 --> 29:13.074
Winchell: It's humiliating, my friends.
It's demeaning.

29:13.168 --> 29:16.080
- Boy 3: Right on!
- Now is the time to say no!

29:16.588 --> 29:18.328
Now is the time to say,

29:18.423 --> 29:22.257
"just because you were born
25 or 30 years before me

29:22.344 --> 29:23.800
"doesn't make you smart.

29:23.887 --> 29:27.379
"It doesn't make you right.
It just makes you old!

29:31.311 --> 29:34.348
"It just makes you
smell worse in the morning!"

29:36.566 --> 29:39.353
Now is the time to band together

29:39.486 --> 29:42.569
and let our parents know
that we're at the dawn of a new era.

29:42.656 --> 29:44.942
- Boy: Yeah!
- The era of our liberation!

29:47.703 --> 29:49.489
An era made possible

29:49.579 --> 29:54.039
by a kid who had the guts
to fight for the power we now possess!

29:57.713 --> 30:00.876
And now, the man whose brilliant legal mind

30:01.216 --> 30:03.332
shone the light on the pathway to freedom,

30:03.427 --> 30:03.791
Mr. Arthur ulysses belt, esquire!

30:03.802 --> 30:07.545
Mr. Arthur ulysses belt, esquire!

30:12.602 --> 30:13.842
Thank you!

30:14.563 --> 30:16.428
I am but a humble servant,

30:16.982 --> 30:21.476
standing at your ready
to assist in this noble cause!

30:21.945 --> 30:23.060
Viva El norte!

30:23.363 --> 30:24.694
Viva El norte!

30:24.781 --> 30:26.237
Viva El norte!

30:26.533 --> 30:29.400
Viva El norte! Viva El norte!

30:31.204 --> 30:34.287
Narrator: But like I said,
north didn't know about any of this.

30:34.374 --> 30:35.910
He was on his way to hawai,

30:36.126 --> 30:38.788
fo meet what he hoped
would be his brand-new parents.

30:56.396 --> 30:58.011
Governor and Mrs. ho?

30:58.523 --> 30:59.933
Aloha, north.

31:00.609 --> 31:02.600
Governor:
Welcome to our island paradise, north.

31:02.694 --> 31:03.729
Aloha.

31:04.196 --> 31:06.027
We've got a big day planned for you.

31:06.114 --> 31:08.480
Waki-waki will take you up to the house
so you can change.

31:08.575 --> 31:09.610
North: Okay.

31:10.077 --> 31:11.077
Aloha.

31:11.161 --> 31:13.777
"Aloha"? I thought that meant hello.

31:14.081 --> 31:17.118
In Hawaii, “aloha” means
"hello" and "goodbye."

31:17.584 --> 31:18.949
Doesn't that get confusing?

31:19.294 --> 31:21.034
Only when you're firing someone.

31:21.171 --> 31:22.206
Oh.

31:22.297 --> 31:23.628
Well, aloha.

31:25.801 --> 31:27.132
Isn't he great?

31:37.437 --> 31:39.018
You know, north, if you settle here,

31:39.106 --> 31:42.098
you'll be many years younger
because of the difference in time zones.

31:42.192 --> 31:44.558
Which means that you won't die
as early as you would

31:44.653 --> 31:46.735
if you lived on the mainland.

31:46.822 --> 31:48.153
That's a plus.

31:55.622 --> 31:56.682
Governor: Another thing, north.

31:56.706 --> 32:00.164
If you live in Hawaii, it's much
easier to get into a good college.

32:00.252 --> 32:01.332
How's that?

32:01.420 --> 32:04.253
Well, here in the islands,
we have only 12 letters in our alphabet.

32:04.339 --> 32:05.339
Really?

32:05.424 --> 32:08.632
That's right. Five vowels.
A "e" "I" "0," "u."

32:08.718 --> 32:12.176
- Seven consonants.
- "H," "kk," "ll "m," "n," "p," "ww."

32:12.889 --> 32:15.847
- I didn't know that.
- Well, sure. Just think about it.

32:15.934 --> 32:19.802
- Waikiki, Honolulu.
- Kaanapali, mauna lani.

32:19.896 --> 32:23.559
That's very interesting,
but how does that help me get into college?

32:23.650 --> 32:26.437
Well, since we don't use the letters
"p" "c," "qd" and "f

32:26.528 --> 32:29.110
you're pretty much guaranteed
to get straight a's.

32:37.205 --> 32:38.536
Governor: What do you think?

32:38.874 --> 32:41.786
North: Well, I like what I see,

32:42.669 --> 32:46.378
but I do have one question,
just for my own peace of mind.

32:47.340 --> 32:48.455
What is it?

32:48.550 --> 32:50.381
Well, I hope I'm not being insensitive,

32:50.469 --> 32:54.758
but you wouldn't happen to have a dead kid
whose shoes you want me to fill, would you?

32:55.348 --> 32:56.679
Dead kid?

32:57.225 --> 33:00.888
North, Hawaii is a lush and fertile land.

33:01.730 --> 33:05.268
In fact, there's only one barren area
on all of our islands.

33:05.942 --> 33:08.524
Unfortunately, it's Mrs. ho.

33:09.738 --> 33:11.524
But if all goes right,

33:11.907 --> 33:14.569
you will be our first child.

33:16.953 --> 33:17.953
North: Wow!

33:18.497 --> 33:19.987
What a great day.

33:21.166 --> 33:23.452
You know, this might really work out.

33:24.169 --> 33:27.832
As far I'm concerned, there's just
a few minor details to discuss.

33:27.923 --> 33:32.166
You know, bedtime, sleepovers,
your views on snacks, that sort of thing.

33:32.260 --> 33:34.717
Well, what are we standing here for?

33:34.804 --> 33:37.386
Let's go inside
and push a few numbers around,

33:37.474 --> 33:39.055
see what we come up with.

33:50.779 --> 33:53.646
Man on pa: Ladies and gentlemen,
governor and Mrs. ho.

34:03.792 --> 34:05.498
Ladies and gentlemen,

34:05.585 --> 34:07.576
fellow 50th staters,

34:07.671 --> 34:09.377
I am thrilled to announce

34:09.464 --> 34:11.876
that we have reached
an agreement in principle

34:11.967 --> 34:14.458
which allows me to introduce to you today

34:14.553 --> 34:16.339
a young man, who in the coming years

34:16.429 --> 34:19.717
will be to Hawaii
what the peach is to Georgia,

34:19.808 --> 34:24.222
what the apple is to New York,
and what the wind is to Chicago!

34:24.521 --> 34:26.806
Now, without further ado,

34:26.898 --> 34:29.935
please give a big, warm Hawaiian welcome

34:30.277 --> 34:34.815
to our new pride and joy, our son north!

35:09.149 --> 35:10.480
What is that?

35:10.734 --> 35:12.725
Governor: Son, that'll be in every airport,

35:12.819 --> 35:14.730
- along every highway...
- My crack?

35:14.821 --> 35:16.903
My crack is gonna be
shown in every airport?

35:16.990 --> 35:18.070
Now, son...

35:18.158 --> 35:21.070
What gives you the right
to show my crack on every highway?

35:21.161 --> 35:22.947
See, the truth is, north,

35:23.955 --> 35:27.447
I'm the governor of a state
that's running a little low on self-esteem.

35:27.542 --> 35:29.123
After 35 years of statehood,

35:29.210 --> 35:31.872
people still don't treat Hawaii
like we're part of the country.

35:32.047 --> 35:33.833
Sure, there's a star for us on the flag,

35:33.923 --> 35:36.585
but why didn't anyone show up
during hands across America?

35:36.676 --> 35:38.962
I mean, we waited for days
and not even a phone call

35:39.054 --> 35:40.197
to tell us nobody was coming.

35:40.221 --> 35:43.179
- It's just plain inconsiderate.
- Mrs. ho: He's right.

35:43.308 --> 35:45.890
People from the mainland
just don't care about Hawaii.

35:45.977 --> 35:48.969
They come here with their knobby knees
and their pale kids,

35:49.064 --> 35:53.433
and they eat our food and watch our whales
and say “aloha” like they really mean it.

35:53.526 --> 35:54.857
But then, seven to 10 days later,

35:54.944 --> 35:57.606
they drop us like a sack of rancid poi
and go home.

35:57.697 --> 35:59.813
And we're supposed
to feel good about ourselves?

36:00.200 --> 36:03.784
Excuse me. But what does this
have to do with my crack?

36:03.912 --> 36:05.743
Oh. Don't you see, north?

36:05.830 --> 36:10.324
If you lived here in Hawaii, people
would be more inclined to settle here.

36:10.669 --> 36:13.206
So they can be close to my crack?

36:13.880 --> 36:17.589
North, north. You're very important to us.

36:18.968 --> 36:20.333
I don't know.

36:20.887 --> 36:23.173
I need some time to think, okay?

36:26.309 --> 36:29.221
Man: One, two, three, four Jacks!

36:29.312 --> 36:32.475
Come on, guys! Don't just stand there.
Get your butt in motion!

36:32.565 --> 36:33.930
You might just like it!

36:34.025 --> 36:35.936
And squat down, up and...

36:36.319 --> 36:37.775
What is the point?

36:38.780 --> 36:40.691
Gabby, what are you doing here?

36:40.782 --> 36:44.366
They say for every hour you exercise,
you add an hour to your life.

36:44.452 --> 36:48.195
Who needs all that extra time if you're
just going to spend it exercising?

36:48.289 --> 36:50.325
You see where I'm going with this, junior?

36:50.417 --> 36:53.534
- Who's Gabby?
- He's a ranch hand from Texas.

36:53.628 --> 36:55.539
Not familiar with the gentlemen.

36:56.423 --> 36:57.663
So...

36:57.757 --> 37:03.002
- How's it feel to be Hawaii's new first son?
- Well, I'm not so sure that's what I want to be.

37:03.096 --> 37:04.336
Why not?

37:04.431 --> 37:05.921
Beautiful climate.

37:06.349 --> 37:09.432
- Can't beat the fashion.
- Yeah, I know.

37:09.894 --> 37:11.622
But I don't think I
should settle for parents

37:11.646 --> 37:14.729
who have to show my most private crevice
on a billboard

37:14.816 --> 37:17.432
to make them feel better about themselves.

37:17.527 --> 37:18.937
It's refreshing to meet a kid

37:19.028 --> 37:21.064
who has such strong convictions
about his crack.

37:21.156 --> 37:22.771
Whoa! Whoa.

37:26.536 --> 37:27.536
Ah!

37:28.413 --> 37:29.744
Dig, man.

37:30.123 --> 37:32.284
The way I always figured this deal is

37:32.375 --> 37:34.729
it's that parents are supposed
to make the kids feel better.

37:34.753 --> 37:35.993
Not the other way around.

37:36.713 --> 37:37.873
Yeah.

37:38.339 --> 37:41.831
Hang in there, kid!
You'll find what you're looking for.

37:42.844 --> 37:44.505
I hope so.

37:46.681 --> 37:49.218
Narrator: Although he came up short
in both Texas and Hawaii,

37:49.309 --> 37:50.924
north felt no anxiety

37:51.019 --> 37:53.476
as he still had eight weeks
till his labor day deadline.

37:56.191 --> 37:57.772
Woman: Welcome to Juneau, Alaska.

37:57.859 --> 38:00.475
Please remain seated
until the plane comes to a complete stop

38:00.570 --> 38:02.231
in Anchorage, Alaska.

38:02.322 --> 38:03.653
To accompany our skid,

38:03.740 --> 38:06.698
we will be showing you
another full-length feature film.

38:07.035 --> 38:12.530
Our friend had a dream,
and that dream is becoming a reality.

38:12.624 --> 38:15.491
Narrator: Meanwhile,
as north was skidding his way to Anchorage,

38:15.585 --> 38:17.246
things were heating up at home.

38:17.337 --> 38:20.204
Winchell's inspirational speeches
had created a groundswell,

38:20.840 --> 38:22.330
and all across the land,

38:22.425 --> 38:25.508
kids were continuing to hold their parents
at emotional gunpoint.

38:26.137 --> 38:28.093
Anything else, son? Yes.

38:28.556 --> 38:30.012
How's my room coming along?

38:30.141 --> 38:32.257
I'll have it spotless by dinner.

38:33.186 --> 38:34.551
Viva El norte.

38:36.064 --> 38:37.554
Winchell: And as of next Monday,

38:37.649 --> 38:40.482
no parent will be permitted
to see an r-rated movie

38:40.568 --> 38:42.604
unless accompanied by a kid.

38:43.279 --> 38:44.815
Yeah, right.

38:44.906 --> 38:47.773
Arthur, do I detect a note of melancholy?

38:47.867 --> 38:50.574
It's just that north
still hasn't found new parents.

38:51.538 --> 38:52.994
Maybe he never will.

38:53.081 --> 38:55.743
Maybe this free agency thing
will just blow up in our face.

38:55.834 --> 38:57.540
I'm surprised at you, Arthur.

38:57.669 --> 39:00.911
Do you think I would actually embark
on an endeavor of this magnitude

39:01.005 --> 39:02.745
without a contingency plan?

39:03.132 --> 39:04.497
Contingency plan?

39:04.926 --> 39:06.211
Oh, good. I love those.

39:06.886 --> 39:08.672
- One Coca-Cola.
- Right here.

39:09.055 --> 39:10.636
And one sex on the beach.

39:11.432 --> 39:13.263
Aren't I naughty?

39:14.602 --> 39:17.184
- To our future.
Arthur: And what a future it is.

39:17.647 --> 39:19.103
According to the latest polls,

39:19.440 --> 39:21.101
parents are so nervous

39:21.192 --> 39:25.401
that 78% of them say they will vote
however their kids tell them to.

39:26.406 --> 39:30.115
And since those kids will do
whatever you tell them to...

39:31.286 --> 39:32.617
Well, I...

39:35.290 --> 39:36.746
What I mean is...

39:36.833 --> 39:37.948
Winchell: That's right.

39:38.209 --> 39:41.042
I'm lying here with the next
President of the United States.

39:44.966 --> 39:46.297
I'm happy for you, Arthur.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.796
I'm sure you'll make
a fine commander-in-chief.

39:49.804 --> 39:52.671
Hey, doll face,
could you concentrate on my lower back?

39:52.765 --> 39:54.630
That's where all my tension builds up.

39:59.814 --> 40:04.353
Man on pa: Flight 24 from Hawaii by way
of Juneau is now arriving at gate seven.

40:05.236 --> 40:07.352
Man on radio: Approach...

40:12.869 --> 40:13.403
Woman: Bye-bye.

40:13.411 --> 40:13.900
Woman: Bye-bye.

40:13.995 --> 40:15.485
Hey, great landing, guys.

40:15.580 --> 40:17.620
You've really got that skid thing
down to a science.

40:17.665 --> 40:19.496
Thanks for the kind words, north.

40:19.584 --> 40:21.645
I'm not saying that we haven't
dented a terminal now and then,

40:21.669 --> 40:24.081
but after a while
you pretty much get the hang of it.

40:24.172 --> 40:25.503
Thanks.

40:27.342 --> 40:30.300
Narrator: North's first impression
of Alaska was a positive one.

40:30.386 --> 40:33.298
The air was clean,
it was breathtakingly beautiful,

40:33.389 --> 40:36.881
and best of all, it was far away
from everyone and everything.

40:36.976 --> 40:38.621
There was nothing to distract these people

40:38.645 --> 40:41.432
from concentrating on life's
most precious commodity,

40:41.522 --> 40:43.228
the love of a good family.

40:51.491 --> 40:52.697
Man: Morning!

40:54.202 --> 40:55.202
\whoa-ho!

41:13.096 --> 41:14.381
Here you go, north.

41:14.722 --> 41:17.259
A nice cup of hot cocoa.

41:17.350 --> 41:20.888
And to go with that,
our state dish, eskimo pie.

41:20.979 --> 41:22.185
Thank you.

41:27.151 --> 41:29.563
Dad: Well, hey, what do you know?
The salmon are running.

41:29.654 --> 41:32.612
I'm going to get a couple of poles
and go fishing with my boy.

41:32.699 --> 41:34.405
Great! I love fishing.

41:35.785 --> 41:36.900
Okay.

41:59.600 --> 42:02.012
- Ah! This is the life, right, son?
- Sure is.

42:02.103 --> 42:04.059
You like Christmas, north?
“Who doesn't?

42:04.147 --> 42:06.917
Well, you've never had a Christmas
till you've had an Alaskan Christmas.

42:06.941 --> 42:09.557
That's right. And since our
days last for months at a time,

42:09.652 --> 42:11.859
you can just imagine the festivities.

42:11.946 --> 42:14.938
Why, opening the presents
takes three weeks alone.

42:15.033 --> 42:16.148
Right, ma?

42:16.743 --> 42:19.610
This all sounds great,
but what's the catch?

42:20.621 --> 42:23.738
- What do you mean?
- I mean, what's in it for you?

42:25.710 --> 42:28.076
- Nothing.
- Really?

42:28.254 --> 42:31.496
No dead kids? No low self-esteem?

42:31.966 --> 42:34.457
No frozen skeletons in your closet?

42:37.764 --> 42:40.972
We have pride, north,
and we're proud of our pride.

42:41.059 --> 42:42.799
We wouldn't ask anything of a child.

42:43.019 --> 42:46.853
All we want is for you to follow your
dreams and be the best north you can be.

42:47.482 --> 42:51.020
We know you'll be a source of great pride
to the entire eskimo community

42:51.110 --> 42:53.271
for many, many years to come.

42:56.491 --> 42:58.652
Jeepers creepers, that reminds me.

43:00.161 --> 43:03.198
Dad, let's go! Time to flow!

43:03.289 --> 43:05.200
- Grandpa: Coming!
- Time to what?

43:05.333 --> 43:07.824
Mom: Okay. Bundle up. It's a long walk.

43:10.671 --> 43:12.127
Who's that?

43:12.215 --> 43:15.048
North, this is your new grandfather.

43:15.676 --> 43:16.882
Hello, north.

43:17.678 --> 43:20.715
Hello. What do you mean,
"it's time to flow"?

43:20.807 --> 43:24.891
When an eskimo gets too old or weak
to contribute to society,

43:24.977 --> 43:28.094
the whole family gets together
and everybody walks to the ocean.

43:28.189 --> 43:32.273
That's right. And then the revered old
eskimo is proudly placed on an ice floe

43:32.360 --> 43:35.067
and set out to sea so he
can die with dignity.

43:35.321 --> 43:36.356
And pride.

43:36.447 --> 43:38.358
All right, everybody, let's go.

43:38.533 --> 43:39.818
North: But wait a minute.

43:40.368 --> 43:43.030
Just because he's old doesn't mean
he can't be part of the family.

43:43.121 --> 43:44.611
Well, it's a tradition.

43:44.705 --> 43:48.072
I promise you, north,
grandpa wants this just as much as anyone.

43:48.167 --> 43:49.373
Right, grandpa?

43:49.794 --> 43:52.877
Yeah, right. I've been
looking forward to this.

43:56.717 --> 43:59.129
Narrator: As the family
made their long trek to the sea,

43:59.220 --> 44:02.337
north took the opportunity
to get close to his new grandpa,

44:02.431 --> 44:05.764
which was easy, since he had
a tremendous affection for old folks.

44:05.852 --> 44:11.142
He found them fo be warm, understanding, and,
most importantly, way too tired to yell.

44:12.733 --> 44:14.769
Knowing that his time with grandpa
was limited,

44:14.861 --> 44:17.648
north tried to take in
all that this wise old man had to offer

44:17.738 --> 44:19.444
about life in the tundra.

44:20.074 --> 44:22.110
Grandpa: And another thing. Up here,

44:22.577 --> 44:27.071
if your mother says, "don't make a face
because it could freeze in that position,"

44:27.498 --> 44:29.580
you better take her seriously.

44:29.876 --> 44:30.991
North: Jeez.

44:31.085 --> 44:34.623
Can't you hang around a little longer?
There's so much you can teach me.

44:36.090 --> 44:37.125
Next!

44:37.842 --> 44:38.842
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

44:38.926 --> 44:40.070
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, okay, okay.

44:40.094 --> 44:41.697
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
Come on. Let's go.

44:41.721 --> 44:43.365
Let's go.
I only got four months of sunlight here.

44:43.389 --> 44:45.596
Move it. Next. Come on. Let's go!

44:47.393 --> 44:49.884
Come on. Come on.
Should've done this before.

44:49.979 --> 44:53.062
I've got a civilization to run here.
Can you move it along, please? Thank you.

44:53.983 --> 44:55.223
Next! Let's go.

44:55.318 --> 44:56.753
Don't act like you don't know
what's going on here.

44:56.777 --> 44:58.358
Come on. Let's go. Come on. Please.

44:59.071 --> 45:00.231
Well...

45:00.865 --> 45:02.150
Goodbye, north.

45:02.783 --> 45:04.523
Are you sure you have to go?

45:04.619 --> 45:06.405
Mom: Oh, don't worry about him, north.

45:06.495 --> 45:07.860
He's had a great life.

45:07.955 --> 45:11.197
And he's happy to set sail
before he starts embarrassing himself.

45:11.542 --> 45:14.955
Yeah, take it from us, north. When drool
hardens, it's not a pretty sight.

45:15.046 --> 45:16.106
- But...
- Man: But, but, but.

45:16.130 --> 45:18.233
Come on. Let's go, pal.
This is no surprise to you, is it?

45:18.257 --> 45:21.612
You know where you're going. Take a walk.
Come on. Let's go. Move it along. Let's go.

45:21.636 --> 45:23.342
Yeah, yeah, bye, bye. Fine. Thank you.

45:23.429 --> 45:24.714
Mom: Bye, dad!

45:24.972 --> 45:25.972
Bye, dad!

45:26.390 --> 45:27.630
Bye.

45:28.684 --> 45:32.927
Listen, if there's a change in policy
in the next couple of weeks,

45:33.731 --> 45:35.847
feel free to track me down.

45:36.150 --> 45:37.560
What did he say?

45:37.652 --> 45:39.563
Hey! What do you say we grab a ride home?

45:39.654 --> 45:41.144
Hey, that's a great idea!

45:50.623 --> 45:53.786
North, don't worry about grandpa.
He'll be okay.

45:54.335 --> 45:55.495
Yeah.

45:56.587 --> 45:59.670
- Can I ride on top?
- Why, sure. It's the best view.

46:05.805 --> 46:08.137
Landscape sure is beautiful up here.

46:10.309 --> 46:12.345
Hey. It's you.

46:13.312 --> 46:14.427
No, it's not.

46:15.606 --> 46:16.606
Oh.

46:20.736 --> 46:22.522
Smell that fresh air.

46:22.863 --> 46:24.524
No smog up here.

46:24.991 --> 46:26.606
How could they do that?

46:27.076 --> 46:30.785
Not even my original parents
would send my grandpa away like that.

46:31.038 --> 46:33.404
Hey, son! How's the view up there?

46:34.542 --> 46:36.248
Great! Thanks.

46:37.712 --> 46:38.872
"Son."

46:39.630 --> 46:41.275
You know, I don't wanna
overstep my bounds,

46:41.299 --> 46:43.881
but unless I'm mistaken,
you're that fellow north.

46:43.968 --> 46:46.710
And unless I'm further mistaken,
you have a deadline of labor day,

46:46.804 --> 46:49.420
which is a week from tomorrow,
to choose new parents.

46:49.515 --> 46:51.631
And unless I'm mistaken even further,

46:51.726 --> 46:53.370
you still haven't found
what you're looking for.

46:53.394 --> 46:56.227
How could labor day be next week?
I just got here.

46:56.314 --> 46:58.680
You walked from your house
to the ice floes, right?

46:58.774 --> 46:59.809
Yeah.

47:00.067 --> 47:02.353
It's a seven-week walk,
even with the wind at your back.

47:02.445 --> 47:06.358
No wonder we stopped for lunch 49 times.

47:06.449 --> 47:07.655
Don't feel bad.

47:07.742 --> 47:10.779
It's that six months of daylight thing,
it throws everybody off.

47:10.870 --> 47:13.577
L, myself, only showered 12 times
during the '70s.

47:13.956 --> 47:17.448
Oh, man! I'll never find new parents.

47:18.002 --> 47:19.412
Unless I misinterpreted the ruling,

47:19.503 --> 47:21.494
you can always go back
to your original parents.

47:21.589 --> 47:22.669
Oh, yeah!

47:22.757 --> 47:24.293
That's just what I wanna do,

47:24.383 --> 47:27.216
go back to the people
who haven't even tried to contact me

47:27.303 --> 47:28.759
in over eight weeks.

47:28.929 --> 47:32.046
Take me to the airport. I've got a lot
to do and not much time to do it.

47:32.141 --> 47:33.677
You got it. Hyah!

47:35.603 --> 47:38.515
Narrator: So, a now desperate north,
with time running out,

47:38.606 --> 47:40.722
raced towards an uncertain future.

47:40.816 --> 47:43.774
Understandably, he was upset that his
parents hadn't called in two months.

47:43.861 --> 47:45.146
What he couldn't know, however,

47:45.237 --> 47:47.853
was that his parents hadn't done
much of anything in two months.

47:47.948 --> 47:50.815
As curator of the Smithsonian institution,

47:50.910 --> 47:54.118
it is my distinct honor
to unveil the newest addition

47:54.205 --> 47:56.992
to our illustrious hall of achievement.

47:57.083 --> 48:00.041
At 78 consecutive days and counting,

48:00.127 --> 48:03.460
the longest simultaneous coma
in medical history,

48:03.547 --> 48:06.084
ladies and gentlemen, north's folks.

48:10.388 --> 48:11.969
I'll now take questions.

48:12.223 --> 48:17.092
Yes! How can you equate a medical oddity
with man's landing on the moon?

48:18.312 --> 48:22.055
With all due respect
to the achievements of the Apollo 11 crew,

48:22.149 --> 48:25.607
the sociological impact
of what these folks did

48:25.694 --> 48:29.027
dwarfs those of Mr. Armstrong et al.

48:29.115 --> 48:30.400
But all they did was faint.

48:30.491 --> 48:32.482
And in so doing,

48:33.077 --> 48:36.410
shifted the familial balance of power
throughout the world.

48:37.164 --> 48:40.497
"Throughout the world"? This thing
is getting bigger than we thought.

48:40.876 --> 48:42.741
It's bigger than you thought.

48:43.003 --> 48:44.994
That's why you're only
going to be president.

48:45.131 --> 48:49.124
Child's continuing process
to improve the status...

48:49.635 --> 48:51.355
Wait a minute. I just thought of something.

48:52.680 --> 48:55.283
What if they start begging and pleading
for north to come back to them?

48:55.307 --> 48:58.470
Oh, my god!
What if north goes back to his folks?

48:59.603 --> 49:00.718
Arthur,

49:01.355 --> 49:04.347
don't you know that
that's an impossibility?

49:04.942 --> 49:09.902
That I would use all my power to prevent
a thing like that from happening?

49:10.823 --> 49:11.823
Oh.

49:12.700 --> 49:13.735
Okay.

49:13.868 --> 49:18.202
What do you say we grab some Chinese?
Maybe the msg will calm you down.

49:21.208 --> 49:24.088
Narrator: Despite north's growing
concern about his approaching deadline,

49:24.170 --> 49:25.370
he did take solace in the fact

49:25.421 --> 49:28.754
that the lord needed only six days
fo create the entire universe.

49:28.841 --> 49:31.321
Certainly, a kid of his caliber,
given an extra couple of days,

49:31.385 --> 49:33.876
should be able to find two measly parents.

49:42.813 --> 49:43.928
Greetings,

49:44.482 --> 49:45.562
north.

49:46.317 --> 49:48.182
I'm thy new father,

49:48.444 --> 49:50.651
and this good woman, who art my wife,

49:51.238 --> 49:52.523
art thy new mother.

49:53.908 --> 49:55.899
And these art thy new brothers,

49:56.202 --> 49:58.488
who art named Ezekiel.

49:59.580 --> 50:01.662
And these art thy new brothers,

50:01.749 --> 50:03.410
who art named art.

50:06.045 --> 50:08.502
Hey, hey, this looks great.

50:08.589 --> 50:10.079
I have always dreamt of a life

50:10.174 --> 50:13.007
without the ever-present
nuisance of electricity.

50:13.427 --> 50:15.839
Just let me grab something from the plane.

50:15.930 --> 50:19.263
I seem to have left my butter churn
in the overhead compartment.

50:19.975 --> 50:21.260
Floor it!

50:24.813 --> 50:27.213
Narrator: While it was not like north
to make snap judgments,

50:27.274 --> 50:28.855
there were only seven days left.

50:28.943 --> 50:31.309
And he had a world
full of potential parents to evaluate.

50:39.119 --> 50:42.361
Man: Long live the north dynasty!

50:46.252 --> 50:47.867
Man: Give him the emperor cut.

51:03.143 --> 51:04.474
Honey!

51:04.728 --> 51:05.763
Honey face!

51:23.414 --> 51:26.076
You seem like very nice folks,

51:26.333 --> 51:28.164
but to be totally honest with you,

51:28.252 --> 51:31.710
if I lived here,
I'm not sure I'd get much homework done.

51:51.275 --> 51:54.893
Quiet, Harry! Quiet!
I think he's trying to tell us something.

51:58.073 --> 52:00.155
Wack, wack, wack-ado...

52:11.211 --> 52:15.124
With three days to go
before his 12:00 noon labor day deadline,

52:15.215 --> 52:18.707
north, the little world traveler,
arrived in New York today

52:18.802 --> 52:23.045
to interview his final set of parents,
ward and Donna Nelson,

52:23.140 --> 52:25.973
who, along with their two children,
bud and Laura,

52:26.060 --> 52:29.052
live in the quaint upstate town of bedford.

52:29.730 --> 52:32.142
When contacted earlier at his office,

52:32.232 --> 52:36.976
ward, the local pediatrician, who, we
understand, still makes house calls,

52:37.071 --> 52:39.608
said, "my family and I
would like nothing better

52:39.698 --> 52:41.905
"than to see north's long journey

52:41.992 --> 52:45.484
"finally be rewarded
with a warm and loving home,

52:45.579 --> 52:47.820
"and we hope we can provide it for him."

52:49.917 --> 52:51.157
Thanks.

52:58.092 --> 52:59.252
Hi, north!

52:59.343 --> 53:01.834
Ward, bud, Laura, he's here!

53:01.929 --> 53:03.260
He's here!

53:04.306 --> 53:05.341
Hi, north!

53:05.432 --> 53:06.467
Hil - hello.

53:06.558 --> 53:07.843
Welcome to our home, son.

53:07.935 --> 53:09.641
Come on in. You tired, hungry?

53:09.728 --> 53:11.764
Mom and I baked you
some chocolate chip cookies.

53:11.855 --> 53:13.561
- Do you like Nintendo?
- North: Oh, yeah.

53:13.649 --> 53:15.230
Woman on TV: Today at mount rushmore,

53:15.317 --> 53:18.525
thousands of angry parents
gathered to voice their opposition

53:18.612 --> 53:21.194
to the bill that would lower
the voting age to seven.

53:21.740 --> 53:25.528
According to Arthur belt, the rising
politician who drafted the bill...

53:25.619 --> 53:28.235
Wait! They were talking about me!

53:28.455 --> 53:31.822
Relax, Arthur, before you know it,
you'll be hearing your name so much,

53:31.959 --> 53:33.415
even you'll be sick of it.

53:33.752 --> 53:35.868
I highly doubt it.

53:38.590 --> 53:39.750
Talk to me.

53:39.842 --> 53:42.333
Boss, it's al with the sleeping dogs.

53:42.553 --> 53:44.259
Yeah, what about them?

53:44.471 --> 53:46.883
Looks like they counted their last sheep.

53:48.767 --> 53:49.882
So it does.

53:51.061 --> 53:54.098
How long will it take
to get operation xerox into place?

53:54.189 --> 53:55.395
Less than a minute, boss.

53:55.482 --> 53:58.098
- Go to it, and, al?
- Yeah, boss?

53:58.193 --> 54:01.560
Don't be surprised if there's a couple
of extra zeros in your next paycheck.

54:01.655 --> 54:03.191
Thanks, boss. I really appreciate it.

54:03.282 --> 54:05.364
- And, al?
- Yeah, boss?

54:05.451 --> 54:07.442
Don't be surprised if there isn't.

54:07.536 --> 54:08.776
I understand.

54:24.261 --> 54:25.546
Good morning.

54:25.971 --> 54:27.211
Where are we?

54:27.431 --> 54:29.513
Where's our son?

54:29.600 --> 54:30.931
Ooh. Can we see our son?

54:31.018 --> 54:32.258
Absolutely. Just follow me.

54:32.352 --> 54:36.220
We got a limo waiting for you outside
with coffee and some nice hot Danish.

54:36.440 --> 54:38.146
Oh, that sounds good.

54:38.233 --> 54:41.066
I won't lie to you. I seem to have
worked up a bit of an appetite.

54:41.153 --> 54:42.689
- Honey?
- I could eat.

54:42.780 --> 54:43.940
Right this way.

55:02.758 --> 55:04.089
Bud: Hike!

55:04.176 --> 55:06.883
Okay, Laura, sack the quarterback!
Here we go. Hey!

55:07.346 --> 55:09.052
Touchdown! Yeah!

55:09.139 --> 55:12.006
You faked me right out of my socks, north!
Great catch, buddy.

55:12.100 --> 55:13.340
Come and get it!

55:13.435 --> 55:14.435
Oh, here we go.

55:14.520 --> 55:17.582
It's so great having you here, north.
I've always wanted a brother to throw to.

55:17.606 --> 55:20.313
Yeah, and now I have
two big brothers to look out for me.

55:20.400 --> 55:23.688
Hey, I know we're all excited
to have north as part of our family,

55:23.779 --> 55:26.270
but he hasn't decided
if he wants to stay with us yet.

55:26.365 --> 55:29.323
- Come on, north. You gotta stay!
- Yeah. We really want you.

55:29.409 --> 55:31.741
Donna: Help yourself, everybody. Dig in.

55:31.829 --> 55:34.195
Laura: Mom, can we go
to the carnival tomorrow?

55:34.289 --> 55:35.495
Bud: Yeah, can we?

55:35.582 --> 55:36.697
Donna: I don't see why not.

55:36.792 --> 55:39.454
- Ward?
- Ward: Sounds good to me.

55:40.546 --> 55:41.956
North,

55:43.465 --> 55:44.921
we miss you so much.

55:45.592 --> 55:47.082
Please forgive us.

55:47.511 --> 55:50.548
We made so many mistakes.

55:51.598 --> 55:53.964
We should've appreciated you more.

55:54.893 --> 55:58.431
If only you could give us
just one more chance.

55:59.606 --> 56:01.346
We love you, son.

56:02.901 --> 56:04.607
We love you very much.

56:05.487 --> 56:06.487
Winchell: Cut!

56:06.572 --> 56:08.779
Very nice. Very, very nice.

56:09.157 --> 56:12.399
Touching, moving, and
yet, not over the top.

56:12.494 --> 56:13.609
Keep it rolling.

56:13.704 --> 56:15.660
So, crazy summer, huh?

56:16.164 --> 56:18.530
- Onh, terrible.
- Very disturbing.

56:18.625 --> 56:20.490
Look, I know what you're going through,

56:20.586 --> 56:23.749
but even if north doesn't come back,
you can always adopt.

56:23.839 --> 56:26.421
Just the other day
I met this adorable little boy,

56:26.508 --> 56:27.964
seven years old.

56:28.051 --> 56:29.962
His name was Hugh.

56:30.262 --> 56:33.675
Maybe you can adopt him.
Maybe Hugh can be your son.

56:35.684 --> 56:37.345
We don't want Hugh.

56:37.436 --> 56:39.097
He's not our son.

56:39.187 --> 56:40.643
We want north.

56:40.981 --> 56:44.439
I understand. It was insensitive
of me to even bring it up.

56:44.818 --> 56:46.729
Uh, you folks want some more coffee?

56:47.112 --> 56:49.478
- Nah. That's okay.
- Not for me.

56:50.073 --> 56:53.236
I still don't understand
why we can't speak to north in person.

56:53.577 --> 56:55.818
I think that would be a big mistake.

56:55.913 --> 56:58.620
North is very angry right now.
He's very sensitive.

56:58.999 --> 57:00.034
You show up unannounced,

57:00.125 --> 57:02.457
and this whole thing
could blow up in your face,

57:02.544 --> 57:05.502
and it would just kill me
to see a thing like that happen.

57:05.589 --> 57:10.333
So, my suggestion is you lay low for a while.
I'll have someone escort you to the Plaza.

57:11.011 --> 57:14.720
I already told Jean-Pierre to give you
all the room service you want,

57:14.806 --> 57:16.671
and as north's best friend,

57:16.767 --> 57:20.680
I'd be more than happy to show him
this tape to pave the way for you.

57:21.480 --> 57:22.640
Thank you, winchell.

57:22.731 --> 57:24.267
Oh, yes.

57:24.358 --> 57:25.939
You're a real friend.

57:26.026 --> 57:27.141
I do what I can.

57:27.235 --> 57:28.816
Bring the car around for north's folks.

57:28.904 --> 57:30.769
Yes, sir. Consider it done.

57:30.864 --> 57:34.277
You know, you're doing very well
for a sixth grader.

57:34.534 --> 57:36.399
Well, I caught a few breaks.

57:38.789 --> 57:41.121
Adam, take the tape down to editing.

57:45.045 --> 57:47.787
Laura: Colonel mustard in the study.
Ward: Yeah.

57:47.881 --> 57:49.166
With the rope.

57:49.257 --> 57:50.622
I don't have any of those.

57:50.717 --> 57:51.717
Neither do I.

57:51.760 --> 57:52.840
Both: Me, neither.

57:52.928 --> 57:53.928
Let's see.

57:55.180 --> 57:57.546
Colonel mustard in the study,

57:58.141 --> 57:59.141
and here's the rope.

57:59.226 --> 58:00.453
Bud: All right.

58:00.477 --> 58:02.288
Ward: Good job, kitten.
Laura: Can we play again?

58:02.312 --> 58:03.552
No. You have to hit the sack.

58:03.647 --> 58:05.387
Come on. You've got
a big day tomorrow.

58:05.482 --> 58:06.918
You don't want to be
tired for the carnival.

58:06.942 --> 58:10.275
Your mom's right. Everybody run upstairs
to bed right now. Let's go.

58:10.362 --> 58:11.477
- Okay.
- Good night, mom.

58:11.571 --> 58:13.311
Good night, honey.
Good night, north.

58:13.407 --> 58:15.819
- Good night.
- Night, mom. Night, dad.

58:15.909 --> 58:17.991
Brush your teeth
before you go to bed.

58:23.917 --> 58:25.782
Sorry to bother you
at this late hour,

58:25.877 --> 58:28.117
but I got something important
here for a kid named north.

58:28.296 --> 58:30.537
- What is it?
- Apparently it's an urgent message

58:30.632 --> 58:32.247
from his original parents.

58:32.843 --> 58:33.958
I'll see that he gets it.

58:34.052 --> 58:35.132
Thank you.

58:40.225 --> 58:41.590
North, honey?

58:41.685 --> 58:42.685
North: Yeah?

58:42.769 --> 58:44.169
Can you
come down here for a minute?

58:44.521 --> 58:45.761
Coming.

58:47.399 --> 58:48.434
What is it?

58:48.525 --> 58:50.686
North, a man just came by
and left this tape for you.

58:50.777 --> 58:52.438
It says it's a message
from your parents.

58:53.780 --> 58:54.940
From my parents?

58:55.615 --> 58:58.982
- Do you mind if I...
- Of course not.

59:02.622 --> 59:04.032
Would you like
to be alone, north?

59:04.124 --> 59:05.330
No. That's okay.

59:16.636 --> 59:18.448
Woman:
After all you two you've been through,

59:18.472 --> 59:20.508
what would you most like
to say to your son?

59:20.974 --> 59:22.259
We don't want Hugh.

59:22.809 --> 59:24.720
Woman: How can you say that?
He's your son.

59:24.978 --> 59:26.263
He's not our son.

59:26.980 --> 59:28.620
Woman:
Aren't you bothered by the prospect

59:28.648 --> 59:30.138
of never seeing your son again?

59:30.567 --> 59:31.727
Nah. That's okay.

59:32.527 --> 59:34.063
Woman:
Isn't this a gut-wrenching,

59:34.154 --> 59:36.145
torturous, emotional experience?

59:36.490 --> 59:37.525
Not for me.

59:37.741 --> 59:38.981
He's not our son.

59:39.367 --> 59:40.652
We don't want Hugh.

59:48.168 --> 59:50.830
North, honey, are you okay?

59:51.338 --> 59:52.978
Ward: Is there anything
we can do for you?

59:54.049 --> 59:55.164
Yeah.

59:56.134 --> 59:57.294
Let me be your son.

59:59.262 --> 01:00:01.002
Narrator:
Finally, north had new parents,

01:00:01.556 --> 01:00:03.922
parents who made him
feel wanted, secure,

01:00:04.059 --> 01:00:05.219
and loved,

01:00:05.644 --> 01:00:07.100
yet something was still wrong.

01:00:08.355 --> 01:00:08.593
The nelsons were everything
he was looking for,

01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:10.445
the nelsons were everything
he was looking for,

01:00:10.524 --> 01:00:11.889
so why couldn't he embrace them?

01:00:13.026 --> 01:00:14.357
North needed answers.

01:00:20.867 --> 01:00:23.279
Ward: North, we just
don't understand why you're leaving.

01:00:23.995 --> 01:00:25.155
Neither do I.

01:00:25.705 --> 01:00:28.492
You're all nice people
and I'm really gonna miss you,

01:00:29.417 --> 01:00:30.953
but I've just got to be alone.

01:00:32.212 --> 01:00:33.543
We're going to miss you, too.

01:00:34.965 --> 01:00:36.205
And so will Oliver.

01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:39.875
Donna: North.

01:00:41.555 --> 01:00:42.715
Here.

01:00:43.223 --> 01:00:45.063
In case you get hungry
on your way to New York.

01:00:46.184 --> 01:00:47.549
Thanks, mom,

01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:49.885
I mean, Mrs. Nelson.

01:00:51.731 --> 01:00:52.811
Bye.

01:01:05.412 --> 01:01:08.404
Narrator: So, with just 24
hours until his labor day deadline,

01:01:08.665 --> 01:01:09.950
no hope of parents,

01:01:10.041 --> 01:01:12.407
and the prospect of
living in an orphanage looming,

01:01:13.128 --> 01:01:15.164
north felt he only
had one option left.

01:01:15.714 --> 01:01:16.920
He would disappear.

01:01:25.056 --> 01:01:27.798
Can you spare some extra change?

01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:29.425
Oh.

01:01:35.442 --> 01:01:36.477
Here.

01:01:36.568 --> 01:01:38.729
Maybe it'll bring you
more luck than it brought me.

01:01:39.779 --> 01:01:42.486
Hey, it's got a hole in it!

01:01:42.949 --> 01:01:44.940
What good does this do me?

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:47.279
Narrator: Yes,
he would disappear,

01:01:48.079 --> 01:01:49.364
and where better to do that

01:01:49.456 --> 01:01:51.321
than amidst the teeming,
faceless masses

01:01:51.416 --> 01:01:52.622
of the naked city?

01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:10.306
Want to go downtown?

01:02:10.393 --> 01:02:12.258
- Shut up!
- I'm gonna arrest you both.

01:02:26.952 --> 01:02:28.112
He's heading into the park.

01:02:28.203 --> 01:02:31.163
Don't worry, boss. I'm just looking
for the right time and the right place.

01:02:31.373 --> 01:02:32.658
So long, al.

01:02:34.084 --> 01:02:35.084
What was that all about?

01:02:35.168 --> 01:02:38.035
Well, it seems that
our young friend's had a change of heart.

01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:41.420
Change of heart?

01:02:41.508 --> 01:02:45.342
He's left the nelsons and has decided
to grace our fair city with his presence.

01:02:46.179 --> 01:02:47.385
Oh, no.

01:02:48.014 --> 01:02:49.424
Well, this ruins everything.

01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:53.183
Arthur, please, use your head.

01:02:53.353 --> 01:02:54.684
This is a godsend.

01:02:55.355 --> 01:02:57.141
- It 1s?
- Of course.

01:02:57.899 --> 01:03:01.141
As we speak, grownups
across this great land of ours

01:03:01.236 --> 01:03:02.772
are feeling humiliated.

01:03:02.862 --> 01:03:05.820
They blame north for all
their frustrations.

01:03:05.907 --> 01:03:08.614
Do you realize how many
of those angry parents

01:03:08.702 --> 01:03:11.990
would like nothing better
than to do away with our little friend?

01:03:12.872 --> 01:03:15.033
And do you know the one catalyst

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:18.037
that can give
a political movement true cohesion?

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:21.586
That's right.

01:03:21.965 --> 01:03:23.205
A martyr.

01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:26.917
You're a genius.
I mean, it's brilliant.

01:03:27.262 --> 01:03:28.718
It's absolutely winchellian.

01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:29.965
It... it...

01:03:31.516 --> 01:03:32.756
But for north to be martyred,

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.880
doesn't he have to be killed
by one of those angry parents?

01:03:36.563 --> 01:03:39.020
Well, maybe we'll get lucky.

01:03:44.154 --> 01:03:45.464
Narrator: As north
ran for his life,

01:03:45.488 --> 01:03:48.328
he couldn't help but wonder how his
dream of finding the perfect parents

01:03:48.366 --> 01:03:49.902
had turned into a nightmare.

01:04:13.933 --> 01:04:15.264
Ah! Ah!

01:04:18.271 --> 01:04:19.306
Ah.

01:04:26.112 --> 01:04:27.112
Damn it!

01:05:14.661 --> 01:05:17.073
Psst! North. Over here.

01:05:17.288 --> 01:05:18.949
Adam, what are you doing here?

01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:23.161
Listen to me very carefully.

01:05:23.503 --> 01:05:25.243
I'm not here. You never saw me.

01:05:25.338 --> 01:05:27.298
We're not even having
this conversation right now.

01:05:27.674 --> 01:05:29.380
- Got that?
- Got what?

01:05:29.717 --> 01:05:30.797
Perfect.

01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:32.841
So, what are we
not talking about?

01:05:34.347 --> 01:05:35.347
This.

01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:36.846
What? I don't see anything.

01:05:37.058 --> 01:05:40.016
Exactly! What you don't see
is a tape of the conversation

01:05:40.103 --> 01:05:41.593
winchell had with your parents.

01:05:41.688 --> 01:05:42.768
I saw it.

01:05:42.856 --> 01:05:45.063
- No, you didn't.
- Oh, I forgot.

01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:46.185
I didn't see it.

01:05:46.276 --> 01:05:47.516
No, you did see it,

01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:49.490
and this is what you
didn't see when you saw it.

01:05:49.737 --> 01:05:50.897
I see.

01:05:51.364 --> 01:05:53.605
I don't think you do.
Look at the tape.

01:05:54.576 --> 01:05:55.907
So, how'd you find me?

01:05:56.077 --> 01:05:58.159
Winchell. He bugged
the nelsons' phones.

01:05:58.246 --> 01:05:59.452
- Winchell?
- Shh!

01:06:01.332 --> 01:06:02.538
He's everywhere.

01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:04.786
I've been working
for him ever since you left home.

01:06:06.087 --> 01:06:09.295
You know, some guy
was chasing me with a gun.

01:06:09.757 --> 01:06:11.213
He was shooting at me.

01:06:12.302 --> 01:06:14.588
That didn't have
anything to do with winchell, did it?

01:06:16.848 --> 01:06:18.133
Oh, man.

01:06:18.475 --> 01:06:19.885
So, why are you doing this?

01:06:20.059 --> 01:06:24.348
I'm not, but if I was,
because I think winchell's gone too far.

01:06:24.981 --> 01:06:27.267
Also, you were always good
to me, north.

01:06:27.734 --> 01:06:29.065
You never picked me last.

01:06:29.152 --> 01:06:31.063
You never made me
play right field.

01:06:31.154 --> 01:06:32.735
I'll never forget that.

01:06:32.906 --> 01:06:34.021
Thanks, Adam.

01:06:35.742 --> 01:06:36.822
Oh, man.

01:06:36.951 --> 01:06:39.283
Adam, I just don't
feel safe anywhere.

01:06:40.705 --> 01:06:41.785
Adam?

01:06:42.582 --> 01:06:43.697
Adam?

01:06:59.766 --> 01:07:01.427
Can I have a hot dog
with just mustard?

01:07:01.601 --> 01:07:03.057
That'll be $1.00.

01:07:07.357 --> 01:07:08.472
Out of five.

01:07:08.942 --> 01:07:11.433
Two, three, four, five.

01:07:11.986 --> 01:07:13.146
There you go.

01:07:16.241 --> 01:07:17.321
Where did you get this?

01:07:17.534 --> 01:07:20.446
Some bum bought
a hot dog from me about an hour ago. Why?

01:07:21.663 --> 01:07:22.994
No reason.

01:07:23.915 --> 01:07:25.075
Ah! Ah!

01:07:37.303 --> 01:07:38.418
Ah!

01:07:51.818 --> 01:07:53.354
We won't see him no more.

01:08:48.625 --> 01:08:50.707
Watch, watch, watch!
Watch there, you...

01:09:00.928 --> 01:09:02.167
Excuse me.

01:09:02.596 --> 01:09:03.962
Move it, kid.

01:09:04.349 --> 01:09:05.714
Come on, move it.

01:09:12.148 --> 01:09:14.764
Comedian: Which reminds me of this man
that walked into a bar.

01:09:15.693 --> 01:09:18.024
He sits down next to
a very beautiful young lady...

01:09:18.529 --> 01:09:20.986
Before you know it,
the conversation turns to sex.

01:09:21.573 --> 01:09:25.863
He says to her, "my darling,
do you smoke after you make love?"

01:09:26.496 --> 01:09:29.238
She says, "I don't know.
I never looked."

01:09:32.251 --> 01:09:36.085
"But I'll tell you one thing,
my smoke alarm never went off.”

01:09:39.091 --> 01:09:41.252
Good night, folks.
You've been great. Thank you.

01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:45.545
Thank you.

01:09:57.443 --> 01:09:58.754
You the kid with the tape? Yeah.

01:09:58.778 --> 01:10:01.269
Good. Come in. I want
to try out my new vcr.

01:10:01.656 --> 01:10:03.647
- How did you know that?
- What's that, kid?

01:10:06.619 --> 01:10:08.180
Of course, I look familiar,
I'm almost famous.

01:10:08.204 --> 01:10:09.489
Joey fingers, nice to see you.

01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:11.195
- And you are?
- North.

01:10:11.499 --> 01:10:13.139
Always been one
of my favorite directions.

01:10:13.543 --> 01:10:15.534
- Mallomar?
- No, thanks.

01:10:16.129 --> 01:10:17.209
That bad, huh?

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:19.837
- What?
- No kid ever refuses a mallomar

01:10:19.924 --> 01:10:22.284
unless he's wrestling
with some pretty heavyweight problems.

01:10:24.011 --> 01:10:27.299
North, we miss you so much.

01:10:28.015 --> 01:10:29.130
Please forgive us.

01:10:29.892 --> 01:10:32.759
We made so many mistakes.

01:10:33.521 --> 01:10:36.228
North's mom: We should've
appreciated you more.

01:10:37.275 --> 01:10:41.314
North's dad: If only you could give us
just one more chance.

01:10:41.863 --> 01:10:43.319
North's mom: We love you, son.

01:10:44.282 --> 01:10:46.523
We love you very much.

01:10:49.954 --> 01:10:51.990
Beautiful. Works like a charm.

01:10:52.665 --> 01:10:54.305
You got some pretty
nice folks there, kid.

01:10:55.293 --> 01:10:56.328
Huh?

01:10:56.794 --> 01:10:58.514
I said you got some
pretty nice folks there.

01:10:59.046 --> 01:11:00.161
Yeah.

01:11:00.506 --> 01:11:01.586
I guess so.

01:11:01.799 --> 01:11:03.799
- What do you mean, you guess so?
- Well, I mean...

01:11:03.843 --> 01:11:06.084
And what did they mean
by "give us one more chance"?

01:11:06.387 --> 01:11:07.672
I thought they didn't love me.

01:11:08.139 --> 01:11:09.254
What are you, nuts?

01:11:09.515 --> 01:11:13.474
That's just the thing. They didn't always
pay that much attention to me.

01:11:13.895 --> 01:11:16.887
So, I left them to find
some new folks who'd appreciate me more.

01:11:17.732 --> 01:11:20.018
I searched the whole world,
but nobody was good enough,

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:22.396
not even the nelsons,
who I just left,

01:11:23.196 --> 01:11:25.027
and they weren't bad folks.

01:11:26.032 --> 01:11:27.772
Maybe there's something
wrong with me.

01:11:28.576 --> 01:11:30.362
Ah, there's nothing
wrong with you.

01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:32.906
I'm sure the nelsons
weren't bad folks.

01:11:33.623 --> 01:11:35.033
They just weren't your folks.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.240
You see those people out there?

01:11:37.710 --> 01:11:38.825
That audience?

01:11:39.003 --> 01:11:41.710
They paid attention to me.
They listened to every word I said.

01:11:42.089 --> 01:11:44.330
They laughed.
They screamed. They applauded.

01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:46.416
They loved me,

01:11:46.761 --> 01:11:48.405
but do you think
that audience is gonna make me

01:11:48.429 --> 01:11:50.090
a cup of tea
if I'm not feeling well?

01:11:50.807 --> 01:11:51.992
You think they're gonna
give me advice

01:11:52.016 --> 01:11:53.616
when I get in a fight
with my best friend

01:11:53.684 --> 01:11:56.847
or, god forbid,
I get in girl trouble?

01:11:56.938 --> 01:11:58.428
Who do you think
I'm gonna turn to?

01:11:59.065 --> 01:12:00.430
I'll give you a hint.

01:12:00.983 --> 01:12:02.098
It's not that audience.

01:12:02.193 --> 01:12:03.649
Oh, my god, what have I done?

01:12:03.736 --> 01:12:05.172
I'll tell you what you've done.

01:12:05.196 --> 01:12:06.596
You've realized
something that takes

01:12:06.656 --> 01:12:08.336
most people
a whole lifetime to figure out.

01:12:08.741 --> 01:12:10.421
And some people
never figure it out at all.

01:12:11.536 --> 01:12:13.902
That a bird in the hand
is always greener than the grass

01:12:13.996 --> 01:12:15.361
under the other guy's bushes.

01:12:20.503 --> 01:12:23.040
It's a metaphor used
mostly by gardeners

01:12:23.130 --> 01:12:24.586
and landscape people in general.

01:12:28.386 --> 01:12:29.421
Hey, kid!

01:12:30.930 --> 01:12:32.591
Hey, kid! Where are you going?

01:12:32.682 --> 01:12:34.422
Home. I miss my parents.

01:12:34.642 --> 01:12:36.682
How are you gonna
get to the airport? You got a car?

01:12:36.769 --> 01:12:38.225
No. I'm 11.

01:12:38.604 --> 01:12:40.094
All right,
then we better take mine.

01:12:42.525 --> 01:12:44.645
Woman:
The white zone is for immediate loading

01:12:44.694 --> 01:12:46.434
and unloading
of passengers only.

01:12:47.029 --> 01:12:48.394
No parking.

01:12:53.494 --> 01:12:55.280
Thanks for everything,
Mr. fingers.

01:12:55.371 --> 01:12:57.612
Make it Joey,
and you're welcome.

01:12:58.249 --> 01:13:01.116
And remember, kid, if you can't
stand the heat, stay out of Miami.

01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:03.200
Well, what does
that metaphor mean?

01:13:03.296 --> 01:13:05.628
What metaphor?
You ever been down there in August?

01:13:05.965 --> 01:13:08.081
Your balls stick to
your leg like crazy glue.

01:13:08.259 --> 01:13:09.374
Good-bye.

01:13:09.468 --> 01:13:11.550
Narrator: And so, north
finally found the parents

01:13:11.637 --> 01:13:12.968
he'd always been looking for.

01:13:13.431 --> 01:13:15.763
Much to his surprise,
they were his own.

01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:18.512
So, it was with a song
in his heart and a smile on his face

01:13:18.644 --> 01:13:20.873
that north prepared to board the
final plane that would take him

01:13:20.897 --> 01:13:23.104
back to the loving arms
of those very parents.

01:13:23.482 --> 01:13:24.762
Where do you think you're going?

01:13:24.942 --> 01:13:27.183
- I'm going home.
- Not on this plane, you're not.

01:13:27.987 --> 01:13:28.987
Why not?

01:13:29.363 --> 01:13:30.819
It says here you're dead.

01:13:34.327 --> 01:13:35.567
But I'm not.

01:13:35.912 --> 01:13:36.992
How can I be sure?

01:13:37.705 --> 01:13:39.320
I'm standing here talking to you.

01:13:39.498 --> 01:13:40.658
I know and that scares me.

01:13:40.958 --> 01:13:42.198
And since I don't scare easily,

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:44.313
you can imagine
how it will affect the other passengers.

01:13:44.337 --> 01:13:45.577
But I'm not dead.

01:13:45.963 --> 01:13:47.794
Sorry, son. I can't take
that chance.

01:13:48.049 --> 01:13:49.084
Boy: Hey, it's north.

01:13:49.175 --> 01:13:50.210
He's alive.

01:13:50.301 --> 01:13:52.917
- What's he doing here?
- This plane's headed to his hometown.

01:13:53.012 --> 01:13:54.798
He's trying
to get back to his old parents.

01:13:54.889 --> 01:13:55.969
It'll ruin everything.

01:13:56.057 --> 01:13:57.467
Let's get him!

01:13:58.017 --> 01:13:59.097
Hey!

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:03.010
Get that traitor!

01:14:07.944 --> 01:14:09.855
Stop him! Get that traitor!

01:14:17.578 --> 01:14:18.988
Hey, kid, hop in.

01:14:23.209 --> 01:14:25.370
North:
What are you, some kind of guardian angel?

01:14:25.711 --> 01:14:27.201
Well, I guess you can say that,

01:14:27.797 --> 01:14:29.691
'cause in a manner
of speaking, we at federal express

01:14:29.715 --> 01:14:31.000
feel that we are guardians,

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:33.298
guardians of your
most important packages

01:14:33.386 --> 01:14:35.923
- and priority communiques.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:14:36.097 --> 01:14:37.382
Just get me home, will you?

01:14:37.556 --> 01:14:40.548
Well, if you absolutely
positively have to be home

01:14:40.643 --> 01:14:42.683
by tomorrow morning,
you've come to the right truck.

01:14:43.729 --> 01:14:46.471
Man, you don't let up
for a second, do you?

01:14:46.565 --> 01:14:48.305
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:14:48.401 --> 01:14:50.401
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:14:51.028 --> 01:14:52.893
Just tell me what to do, okay?

01:14:53.572 --> 01:14:54.903
Get in.

01:14:58.202 --> 01:14:59.533
Federal express, huh?

01:14:59.704 --> 01:15:00.739
Okay, thanks.

01:15:02.039 --> 01:15:03.279
Oh, al.

01:15:03.749 --> 01:15:05.364
Can I have a word with you?

01:15:05.793 --> 01:15:07.533
Oh. Sure, boss.

01:15:08.754 --> 01:15:11.086
Remember when you
told me north was dead?

01:15:11.465 --> 01:15:13.581
- Yeah.
- Uh, just curious,

01:15:13.718 --> 01:15:14.798
what'd you base that on?

01:15:25.229 --> 01:15:28.096
I can only assume
that you think this is blood, al,

01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:30.351
and if I had an [.Q. Below 24,

01:15:30.443 --> 01:15:32.479
I suppose I might think
the same,

01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:34.777
but the stain in this cap
comes from borscht.

01:15:35.656 --> 01:15:37.738
- Borscht?
- Yes, borscht,

01:15:37.825 --> 01:15:39.816
a beet-based soup,
Russian in origin,

01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:43.448
most frequently served chilled
with a dollop of sour cream.

01:15:43.956 --> 01:15:45.366
I make a good borscht.

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:47.998
And I'd love
to sample it someday,

01:15:48.461 --> 01:15:50.702
but the point
I'm making here, al,

01:15:50.796 --> 01:15:53.583
is that unless
north's head was filled

01:15:53.674 --> 01:15:56.416
with this
traditional slavic delicacy,

01:15:56.510 --> 01:15:58.717
he's not dead, you idiot!

01:15:58.804 --> 01:16:01.011
- Oh, no! This means that...
- Not now, Arthur.

01:16:01.098 --> 01:16:04.636
All right. All right. This just calls
for a slight change in plans.

01:16:13.694 --> 01:16:14.979
I'll take it from here.

01:16:15.321 --> 01:16:16.401
All right.

01:16:16.655 --> 01:16:17.861
Sign on the fourth line.

01:16:18.282 --> 01:16:19.362
What time is it?

01:16:19.408 --> 01:16:22.024
Well, normally my answer
would be no later than 10:30,

01:16:22.119 --> 01:16:24.701
but thanks
to that Jack-knifed truck on the highway,

01:16:24.789 --> 01:16:27.531
I'm sorry to say
it's almost 10 to 12:00.

01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:31.291
We'll, we'll be happy
to refund your...

01:16:31.378 --> 01:16:32.663
No, that's okay.

01:16:33.422 --> 01:16:35.583
Mom! Dad!

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:37.290
I'm home!

01:16:37.843 --> 01:16:39.003
Mom!

01:16:40.763 --> 01:16:42.003
Where are you guys?

01:16:42.973 --> 01:16:44.838
Mom? Dad?

01:16:47.103 --> 01:16:48.263
Mom?

01:16:49.855 --> 01:16:51.516
Mom?

01:16:51.607 --> 01:16:53.598
Hello, north. Happy labor day.

01:16:53.859 --> 01:16:55.645
I trust your summer
was an enjoyable one.

01:16:55.861 --> 01:16:56.941
Where are my folks?

01:16:57.154 --> 01:16:58.274
Oh, they're at a safe place.

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:02.027
Where the hell are my parents?

01:17:02.118 --> 01:17:04.655
North, did you
say the word "hell"?

01:17:05.204 --> 01:17:06.910
My, the summer's
really broadened you.

01:17:07.581 --> 01:17:10.948
Winchell, I've got exactly 10 minutes
to find my parents,

01:17:11.043 --> 01:17:12.783
and if you don't tell me
where they are,

01:17:12.962 --> 01:17:16.045
I'll show you how much this summer's
broadened me you little asshole!

01:17:18.008 --> 01:17:19.339
Why are you smiling?

01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:21.341
I was just thinking
what a beautiful

01:17:21.428 --> 01:17:23.134
heartwarming scene
it's going to be

01:17:23.222 --> 01:17:24.699
when you're reunited
with your parents

01:17:24.723 --> 01:17:26.429
at that secret spot of yours.

01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:28.761
How do you know
about my secret spot?

01:17:29.103 --> 01:17:30.343
I'm a journalist, north.

01:17:30.479 --> 01:17:32.094
It's my job to know
about these things,

01:17:32.565 --> 01:17:34.681
and as much as I'm
enjoying this little chat,

01:17:34.775 --> 01:17:36.231
shouldn't you be on your way?

01:17:36.318 --> 01:17:40.903
After all, you're down
to nine minutes.

01:17:55.045 --> 01:17:57.752
Where is he?
Winchell said he'd be here by now.

01:17:58.716 --> 01:18:00.047
Don't worry, honey.

01:18:00.759 --> 01:18:01.919
I'm sure, he'll be here soon.

01:18:02.178 --> 01:18:03.714
Soon may not be good enough.

01:18:03.804 --> 01:18:06.170
Let me remind you,
I've been sent here by the court

01:18:06.265 --> 01:18:09.348
to ensure that your son's
physically in your arms by 12:00 noon.

01:18:09.894 --> 01:18:11.100
How much time is left?

01:18:11.228 --> 01:18:12.434
Six minutes.

01:18:13.147 --> 01:18:16.059
And that's
my own clock from my own house.

01:18:38.923 --> 01:18:40.333
Maybe we should go look for him.

01:18:40.424 --> 01:18:41.709
No, no, honey.

01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:44.542
What if we leave here and then north shows
up and then we miss him?

01:18:46.013 --> 01:18:47.924
Relax, honey.

01:18:48.224 --> 01:18:49.805
Winchell's a man of his word.

01:18:51.477 --> 01:18:52.592
Hey, watch yourself, kid.

01:19:05.991 --> 01:19:07.947
North's mom:
He has less than one minute.

01:19:08.035 --> 01:19:09.638
All right, you wait here.
I'll go look for him.

01:19:09.662 --> 01:19:11.368
Good idea. Judge: Bad idea.

01:19:11.455 --> 01:19:13.161
Let me remind you,
the ruling stipulates

01:19:13.249 --> 01:19:15.490
that north is supposed to be
in the arms of both parents.

01:19:15.584 --> 01:19:17.245
That's two parents
and four arms.

01:19:17.336 --> 01:19:19.918
If one of you leaves,
we're down to one parent and two arms,

01:19:20.005 --> 01:19:21.415
the math speaks for itself.

01:19:29.473 --> 01:19:31.009
Mom! Dad!

01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:32.510
Both: North!

01:20:03.424 --> 01:20:04.504
Hey.

01:20:05.301 --> 01:20:06.416
You still here?

01:20:07.428 --> 01:20:08.588
Yeah.

01:20:09.471 --> 01:20:10.756
I must've fallen asleep.

01:20:11.849 --> 01:20:13.430
Come on. I'll give you
a ride home.

01:20:19.565 --> 01:20:21.430
North:
And then you were a beach bum.

01:20:21.525 --> 01:20:23.311
And then you drove a sleigh.

01:20:23.402 --> 01:20:24.733
And then you were a comedian

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:26.685
who said my parents
were the best for me.

01:20:27.197 --> 01:20:29.438
I said that? Yeah.

01:20:29.533 --> 01:20:31.364
I must be a pretty smart guy.

01:20:43.339 --> 01:20:44.624
What's that?

01:20:45.299 --> 01:20:46.630
Oh, nothing.

01:20:47.509 --> 01:20:48.999
Just something I've always had,

01:20:50.137 --> 01:20:52.093
you know, for good luck.

01:20:53.432 --> 01:20:54.842
Yeah, maybe good luck for you.

01:20:55.726 --> 01:20:57.806
I bet that eagle's whistling
a little different tune.

01:20:58.771 --> 01:20:59.931
Here we go.

01:21:00.022 --> 01:21:01.558
35, maple drive.

01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:13.110
Thanks a lot, mister.

01:21:13.494 --> 01:21:14.700
Don't mention it, kid.

01:21:14.912 --> 01:21:17.949
And remember,
be it ever so humble,

01:21:18.374 --> 01:21:19.614
there's no place like home.

01:21:20.584 --> 01:21:22.540
With the possible
exception of Vegas

01:21:22.628 --> 01:21:24.835
when Sinatra's in town. Bye.

01:21:38.435 --> 01:21:40.391
- North's mom: North!
- North!

01:21:40.521 --> 01:21:42.227
Mom! Dad!

01:21:48.153 --> 01:21:50.439
Where were you?
We were worried sick.

01:21:51.573 --> 01:21:53.814
I fell asleep in the mall.

01:21:54.410 --> 01:21:56.901
We called the hospitals.
We called the police.

01:21:56.995 --> 01:21:58.576
Oh, we looked everywhere.

01:21:59.164 --> 01:22:00.324
You did?

01:22:00.707 --> 01:22:01.822
Of course, we did.

01:22:03.043 --> 01:22:04.829
We love you so much, north.

01:22:07.005 --> 01:22:10.042
If anything ever happened to you,
I don't know what we'd do.

01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:13.000
I love you guys, too.

01:22:13.345 --> 01:22:14.505
Come on.

01:22:15.055 --> 01:22:16.340
You hungry, honey?

01:22:16.432 --> 01:22:18.827
North: A little bit.
North's dad: A little bit? A little bit?

01:22:18.851 --> 01:22:20.637
North: Okay, a lot.
North's dad: Okay.

01:22:20.727 --> 01:22:23.059
I'll tell you what, you run upstairs,
put on your pajamas,

01:22:23.147 --> 01:22:24.624
we'll bring something up for you.
Tuck you in.

01:22:24.648 --> 01:22:25.933
North: Okay.
