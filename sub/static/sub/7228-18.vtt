[laughs]

00:58.058 --> 00:59.684
[Doc reading]

01:05.190 --> 01:06.441
[Doc] It's today!

01:10.278 --> 01:11.488
Get up, everybody.

01:11.571 --> 01:12.572
[all murmuring]

01:12.655 --> 01:13.740
Rise and shine.

01:13.823 --> 01:15.492
I'm up, I'm up.

01:15.575 --> 01:17.368
[squeaking]
Today is a special day.

01:17.702 --> 01:18.787
[gasps] It is?

01:18.870 --> 01:20.163
What's so special?
Why?

01:20.246 --> 01:23.750
Three years ago today,
my mom got Hallie for me.

01:23.833 --> 01:26.586
I loved her
the moment I saw her.

01:26.669 --> 01:30.006
And I've celebrated this day
as her birthday ever since.

01:30.089 --> 01:31.090
It's her birthday!

01:31.174 --> 01:33.259
Love that hippo.
My favorite nurse.

01:33.343 --> 01:36.513
Oh, we should do
something special
for her birthday.

01:36.596 --> 01:38.973
Hmm. What would Hallie like?

01:39.057 --> 01:41.601
If I know that hippo,
and I do,

01:41.684 --> 01:44.187
I know there's
two things she likes,

01:44.270 --> 01:46.439
parties and surprises.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.358
[gasps] Sounds like
we should throw her...

01:48.441 --> 01:50.443
[all] A surprise party!

01:50.819 --> 01:52.904
We have to get decorations
and balloons.

01:52.987 --> 01:54.697
And a birthday cupcake!

01:54.781 --> 01:59.202
And I got her a present.
It's her very own nurse's bag.

01:59.285 --> 02:00.411
[gasps] Oh...

02:00.495 --> 02:02.247
She's gonna love that.

02:02.330 --> 02:03.623
I know.
Ooh!

02:03.706 --> 02:04.833
Yeah!

02:08.127 --> 02:10.003
Okay, everybody,
we have to sneak

02:10.088 --> 02:11.965
all the decorations
and the cupcake

02:12.048 --> 02:14.634
into the checkup room
without Hallie seeing us.

02:14.717 --> 02:16.136
So, what's the plan?

02:16.219 --> 02:18.763
Lambie and Stuffy
will pretend to be nurses.

02:19.931 --> 02:22.559
And I'm going to need you guys
to pretend you're sick.

02:22.642 --> 02:25.520
I'll try, but I don't know
if I can pull it off.

02:25.603 --> 02:27.230
[all laughing]
Shh.

02:29.732 --> 02:31.151
[giggles]

02:33.570 --> 02:35.196
Well, good morning, Doc.

02:35.530 --> 02:36.614
Good morning, Hallie.

02:36.698 --> 02:38.992
Let's see what's on
the calendar today.

02:40.034 --> 02:41.286
[gasps]

02:41.369 --> 02:43.580
Well, I'll be stuffed!

02:43.663 --> 02:45.790
Today is my birthday.

02:45.874 --> 02:47.167
[giggles]

02:48.668 --> 02:50.587
[humming]

02:50.920 --> 02:54.424
Don't know if you know, Doc,
but today is a special day.

02:54.757 --> 02:56.050
It sure is, Hallie.

02:56.134 --> 02:57.510
That's right, it's...

02:57.594 --> 03:01.014
Looking like it's gonna be
the busiest day
the clinic's ever had.

03:06.269 --> 03:07.270
Shh.

03:11.316 --> 03:14.777
Well, now that sure puts
a bump in the birthday bus.

03:15.737 --> 03:17.405
I'll get
the checkup room ready.

03:17.488 --> 03:19.157
Don't go back there!
We'll do it!

03:19.240 --> 03:21.868
What in the pecan pie
is going on here?

03:21.951 --> 03:23.995
Oh, I got some extra help.

03:24.412 --> 03:25.455
Psst. Stuffy.
Huh?

03:25.538 --> 03:26.581
Your decorations
are showing.

03:26.664 --> 03:27.540
Oh, no!

03:27.624 --> 03:28.958
What's that behind Stuffy?

03:29.375 --> 03:30.960
I don't see anything.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.754
I can't see anything.

03:33.087 --> 03:36.799
Hallie, I'm gonna need you
to stay out front
and check everyone in.

03:36.883 --> 03:39.177
And I'll go in back
and check everyone up.

03:42.388 --> 03:43.640
Uh, see ya.

03:44.432 --> 03:48.061
[sighs] This is not how
I expected to spend my birthday.

03:48.144 --> 03:50.730
But I sure do love
taking care of everyone.

03:51.689 --> 03:56.694
Even if, hmm,
sometimes they forget
to take care of me.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.823
[Doc] Buddy, Niles,
why don't you come on back?

04:03.993 --> 04:05.495
Uh-oh. Oh, no!

04:05.578 --> 04:07.789
Now, there,
let's get started.

04:07.872 --> 04:11.501
[all gasp]
Fear not, I shall
distract Lady Hallie.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.169
[grunts]

04:13.253 --> 04:14.087
Who's next?

04:14.170 --> 04:15.922
'Tis I, Sir Kirby.

04:16.005 --> 04:17.714
What seems to be the problem?

04:17.798 --> 04:22.512
The problem? Ah, well,
I have a terrible case
of the, um...

04:22.595 --> 04:25.848
uh, the dancies.
Yes, the dancies.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.267
The what-sies?

04:27.350 --> 04:30.561
Oh! Oh, dear, oh, dear.
I feel a bout of it coming on.

04:31.062 --> 04:33.064
[scatting]

04:33.147 --> 04:36.609
Oh, there, you see?
I-- I start dancing and
I simply cannot stop.

04:36.693 --> 04:39.279
Oh! Sir Kirby.

04:41.239 --> 04:45.868
Ah! Oh, and I grab whomever
is nearby to dance with me.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.704
Oh, you're good.
[screams]

04:47.787 --> 04:48.830
Whoa! Ha! Huh?

04:48.913 --> 04:50.331
[chuckling]

04:53.167 --> 04:54.294
Come on!

04:56.004 --> 04:56.963
Ah. [chuckles]

04:57.046 --> 04:59.841
There, you see?
Suddenly, it's over.

04:59.924 --> 05:03.469
Oh, this is
definitely something
I've got to show Doc.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.807
No, no, no, no, no!
[stammering]
You can't do that.

05:07.890 --> 05:09.017
Why not?

05:09.100 --> 05:10.601
Why not?
Um, why not indeed...

05:10.685 --> 05:14.731
Because...
Because, you see, I also have
a severe case of the, uh...

05:14.814 --> 05:16.691
The silly willies.
[giggling]

05:16.774 --> 05:18.484
[laughing]

05:18.568 --> 05:19.902
Whoo! [grunting]

05:19.986 --> 05:21.863
[laughing, grunting]

05:24.449 --> 05:25.491
[chuckling]

05:25.575 --> 05:27.285
That is silly.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.874
This looks amazing.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.335
She's gonna love it.

05:35.793 --> 05:37.378
I sure do good work.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.048
[screams] Whoa!

05:40.131 --> 05:41.924
Oh!
[thud]

05:42.508 --> 05:45.094
I knew birthday parties
were dangerous.

05:45.553 --> 05:47.096
Are you guys okay?

05:47.180 --> 05:48.306
Yep, I'm great.

05:48.389 --> 05:49.599
Uh, probably not.

05:49.682 --> 05:50.892
[giggling]

05:50.975 --> 05:52.894
We're almost ready.

05:52.977 --> 05:56.689
I hope the balloons
get here soon.
Hallie loves balloons.

05:56.773 --> 05:59.358
Whoo-hoo! Here comes
Hermie with the balloons.

05:59.901 --> 06:02.195
Sir Kirby's
keeping Hallie distracted.

06:02.278 --> 06:04.947
I don't know how much longer
he can keep it up.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.949
Waddle, waddle, waddle,
quack, quack, quack.

06:07.033 --> 06:09.285
[laughing]
I'm a duck, you see.

06:09.702 --> 06:12.747
So, wait one
marshmallow-melting minute!

06:12.830 --> 06:15.249
You're telling me
you've got the dancies,

06:15.333 --> 06:17.126
the silly-willies,
and the quacks?

06:18.044 --> 06:20.505
[gasps]
What are you looking at?

06:22.006 --> 06:23.049
Nothing.

06:23.132 --> 06:26.928
Did I mention I might have
a touch of the, um, eye-rollies?

06:27.011 --> 06:29.639
Ooh, ooh, ooh,
ooh, ooh, ooh...

06:35.394 --> 06:36.896
Great job, Hermie.

06:37.480 --> 06:38.606
Oops.

06:39.273 --> 06:40.483
Got it!

06:42.318 --> 06:44.821
Thanks, Doc.
That was wicked fun.

06:44.904 --> 06:47.740
Besides,
anything for Hallie.

06:47.824 --> 06:48.825
Ta-da!

06:48.908 --> 06:50.535
I'm done
wrapping her present!

06:50.618 --> 06:54.163
Good. [chuckles]
I think we're ready
to surprise Hallie.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.998
I can't wait.

06:56.499 --> 06:57.708
Well, you better be ready,

06:57.792 --> 07:01.045
because there's
one determined hippo
headed this way.

07:01.462 --> 07:04.048
Hi, Hallie.
Is something wrong?

07:04.132 --> 07:07.343
Yes. Sir Kirby
needs a checkup, and bad.

07:07.426 --> 07:10.221
He's got the dancies
and the silly-willies,
the quacks,

07:10.304 --> 07:11.389
and the giggles!

07:11.472 --> 07:13.724
[laughing, babbling]

07:16.227 --> 07:18.688
You know something
fascinating, I...

07:18.771 --> 07:21.232
I'm suddenly
feeling much better.

07:21.315 --> 07:24.777
In fact, all better
is what I am before you.
I'm all better.

07:24.861 --> 07:25.695
Oh, dear.

07:26.112 --> 07:29.323
Good, and all the other toys
are feeling better, too.

07:29.407 --> 07:32.493
So, Hallie, I need you
to come into the checkup room.

07:32.577 --> 07:34.245
You do? Why?

07:34.328 --> 07:36.581
[screaming] Whoa!

07:37.331 --> 07:38.249
Hey!

07:38.332 --> 07:41.752
[Doc] Because it's time
for us to give you
your birthday su...

07:41.836 --> 07:43.546
Ahhh! Not ready!

07:44.755 --> 07:46.174
Uh, checkup.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.217
A checkup? Oh.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.677
Is that all I get?

07:50.052 --> 07:53.639
Uh, yep! It's time
for your birthday checkup!

07:53.973 --> 07:55.391
Nice save.

08:00.271 --> 08:03.191
Doc! I can't see
without my glasses.

08:03.774 --> 08:04.734
I know.

08:04.817 --> 08:07.695
So why in the weeping willows
did you take 'em off?

08:08.321 --> 08:11.908
Because... uh,
checking your eyesight

08:11.991 --> 08:14.452
is the first part
of your yearly checkup.

08:14.535 --> 08:17.997
It's important for doctors
to check you out once a year.

08:18.456 --> 08:21.417
Let's check your eyes.
Can you see anything?

08:22.627 --> 08:23.669
Not a thing!

08:23.753 --> 08:24.962
Good.

Let me help you.

09:09.298 --> 09:10.466
No need, Doc.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.761
I know this room
like the back of my hippo hand.

09:14.345 --> 09:16.222

Ooh.

looks good, too.

Good. Good.

09:40.079 --> 09:41.205
Great!

09:41.872 --> 09:45.376
Well, Hallie,
you're about the healthiest
toy hippo I've ever seen.

09:46.168 --> 09:49.463
Well, being healthy
is a great birthday present.

09:49.547 --> 09:52.216
I'm just gonna need you
to put your glasses back on

09:52.300 --> 09:54.552
so I can check one more thing.

09:54.635 --> 09:57.096
Just, tell me
if you can see this...

09:59.390 --> 10:00.808
[all] Surprise!

10:00.891 --> 10:01.809
[Hallie gasps]

10:02.310 --> 10:04.729
Well, if that don't
make a hippo happy.

10:04.812 --> 10:08.608
If there's two things I love,
it's surprises and parties!

10:09.150 --> 10:11.944
Oh, I thought you'd forgotten
all about me.

10:12.361 --> 10:13.362
Never.

10:14.113 --> 10:17.241
Milady, I present

See, your eyesight
is as perfect as you are.

10:26.208 --> 10:27.835

Ah, 'tis true.
You are the queen

10:32.590 --> 10:34.300
Thank you for this, Doc.

10:34.383 --> 10:35.468
You deserve it.

Ooh, that hurts!

13:55.918 --> 13:58.337
Hey, Doc,
can I get a little help?

13:58.796 --> 13:59.672
Of course!
No!

13:59.755 --> 14:01.715
Don't get too close
to the shark, please!

14:01.799 --> 14:04.093
[chuckling] Lambie.
I can't see.

14:04.176 --> 14:05.970

What's going on,
Mr. Chomp?

Something's wrong with my bite.

so I can see.

14:18.732 --> 14:20.401
He's coming for ya!

14:24.405 --> 14:25.406
I can't look.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.783
You guys! Don't be silly.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.870
Mr. Chomp's
the sweetest shark ever!

14:34.456 --> 14:37.042
Let's get you to my room
and take a look.

14:42.548 --> 14:43.716
Hi, guys.

14:45.384 --> 14:47.887
Dragons love a bouncy bed.

14:48.304 --> 14:50.347
Boing! Boing!
[Chilly yelling]

14:50.431 --> 14:52.725
Come on, Chilly!
Bounce with me!

14:52.808 --> 14:56.478
Snowmen aren't really
meant for bouncing!

14:56.562 --> 14:58.689
Snow is delicate,
you know.

14:59.231 --> 15:00.482
Aah!
Whoa!

15:00.566 --> 15:01.400
[gasps]

Shark!

15:03.402 --> 15:05.154
Everyone, we have a new...

15:06.989 --> 15:08.949
Hey! Where did everybody go?
Uh...

15:09.408 --> 15:13.871
Doc?
Why is there a... [stammering]
shark in the bedroom?

15:14.371 --> 15:17.666
Oh. This is Mr. Chomp,
Donny's bath toy.

15:18.542 --> 15:20.085
[groaning]
[all whimpering]

15:20.169 --> 15:23.047
He needs help
and the clinic
is closed now

15:23.130 --> 15:26.091
so we'll have to set up
a field hospital right here.

15:26.467 --> 15:28.177
Who wants to go get Hallie?

15:28.260 --> 15:29.845
Don't leave me
with the shark!

15:29.929 --> 15:31.013
Me! Oh, me!

15:31.931 --> 15:36.226
Okay, uh,
Hermie and Squeakers.

15:36.852 --> 15:37.853

15:37.937 --> 15:40.522
Good luck, guys.
Hope the shark doesn't eat ya!

15:41.065 --> 15:44.860
We need to get set up.
I have some stuff over here.

15:45.235 --> 15:46.445
I'll come with you!

15:46.862 --> 15:50.991
The name's Stuffy.
Stuffy the Brave Dragon.

15:51.408 --> 15:54.870
Pleased to meet you,
Stuffy the Brave Dragon!

15:54.954 --> 15:57.081
[chuckling nervously]
So, uh,

15:57.164 --> 15:59.708
what's the popular food
for sharks these days?

15:59.792 --> 16:04.046
Calamari, uh, mangos...
[gulps] Dragons?

16:04.421 --> 16:06.256
Oh, gosh, no! I would...

16:06.340 --> 16:07.633

16:15.140 --> 16:16.809
[whimpers]
[squeaking]

16:25.609 --> 16:27.987
We can use my desk
for the checkup.

16:28.821 --> 16:29.655
Ahhh!

16:30.114 --> 16:32.199
Let's make more room
for Mr. Chomp.

16:33.617 --> 16:36.161
Chilly, move that microscope
out of the way.

16:36.245 --> 16:37.705
Uh, sure, Doc.

16:38.872 --> 16:40.666
Ooh! Um...

16:44.128 --> 16:45.254
Huh?

16:45.337 --> 16:48.424
Doc, I think
I have giant-hand-itis.

16:48.507 --> 16:50.551
My hand is huge!

16:51.010 --> 16:53.887
Chilly, you're looking
through a microscope.

16:53.971 --> 16:55.973
It makes things look bigger.

16:56.432 --> 17:00.102
Whew. That's a relief.
That's why you're the Doc.

17:01.353 --> 17:02.813
There. That'll work.

17:02.896 --> 17:04.356
[squeaking]

17:08.484 --> 17:10.612
I'm coming, Doc!
I'm coming!

17:10.695 --> 17:13.156
[squeaking]
[sighs] Whew.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.907
I came as soon as I heard.

17:14.992 --> 17:17.243
I haven't moved so fast
since the Gulpy Gators

17:17.327 --> 17:19.329
thought I had
a marble in my pocket.

17:19.413 --> 17:22.165
Thanks, you guys.
I guess I'm a dentist tonight.

17:22.665 --> 17:25.794
Dentists are like doctors
for your teeth.

17:25.877 --> 17:28.589
Now let's take a look
at that tooth.

17:29.673 --> 17:30.841
Open wide!

17:30.924 --> 17:32.509
[Chilly] Stop!
I can't watch!

17:32.593 --> 17:34.928
Are you sure
this is a good idea, Doc?

17:35.012 --> 17:37.222
Couldn't you just
look from over here?

17:37.306 --> 17:39.725
Yeah! Those teeth
are so pointy!

17:39.808 --> 17:41.477
Looks wicked dangerous!

17:41.894 --> 17:45.522
I've told you guys,
there's nothing
to be scared of.

17:45.606 --> 17:47.649
Besides,
doctors make a promise

17:47.733 --> 17:49.860
to help any patient
who needs them.

17:49.943 --> 17:51.737
Even if you're scared
of them.

17:51.820 --> 17:54.615
And no one should be scared
of sweet Mr. Chomp!

17:54.698 --> 17:56.408
Mmm. Thanks.

17:56.492 --> 17:57.910
[sobbing]
Oh.

17:57.993 --> 18:01.955
Mr. Chomp, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt you.

18:02.372 --> 18:04.708
Oh, you didn't
do anything, Doc.

18:04.792 --> 18:08.796
It's not my tooth that hurts.
[sniffling] It's my heart.

18:09.546 --> 18:11.924
Your heart? Are you sad?

18:12.382 --> 18:17.304
It's just that,
it makes me feel bad when
everyone is afraid of me.

18:17.596 --> 18:21.183
You guys aren't still afraid
of Mr. Chomp, are you?

18:21.683 --> 18:24.770
Well, yeah.
He's a shark, Doc.

18:24.853 --> 18:26.355
He chomps things!

18:26.438 --> 18:28.982
With wicked sharp teeth!

18:29.608 --> 18:31.110
I know I look scary

18:31.193 --> 18:34.113
and Donny sure plays with me
like I'm scary,

18:34.196 --> 18:36.615
but that's not
the real me at all.

ever seen Mr. Chomp

be anything but as sweet
as summer sunshine?

I guess maybe
we were wrong.

19:55.944 --> 19:59.323
Sounds to me you were
too busy looking at
the size of his teeth

19:59.406 --> 20:01.325
to notice
the size of his heart.

20:01.825 --> 20:03.911
Oh, we're sorry,
Mr. Chomp.

20:03.994 --> 20:06.914
I should have given you
a cuddle a long time ago.

a checkup.

Wicked good idea!
Now you're talking!

20:21.136 --> 20:23.555
That's a super loose tooth,
all right.

20:23.972 --> 20:25.641
I have a diagnosis.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.476
You have loose-tooth-iosis.

20:31.146 --> 20:33.440
Uh-oh.
That doesn't sound so good.

20:33.857 --> 20:36.818
Oh, this kind of thing
happens all the time
with people.

20:40.405 --> 20:42.074
Your tooth
must have come loose

20:42.157 --> 20:44.910
when Donny chomped you
on something really hard.

20:45.285 --> 20:47.412
[whimpers]
Can you fix it, Doc?

20:47.913 --> 20:49.831
Yep. I'll just
paste it back in

20:49.915 --> 20:51.875
and you can get back
to chomping.

20:52.876 --> 20:55.212
Oh, I'm a little scared.

20:56.088 --> 21:00.092
I suppose this brave dragon
can be brave enough
for both of us.

21:00.425 --> 21:02.094
I can be brave
for you, too.

21:02.594 --> 21:04.805
Gosh, thanks.

21:05.389 --> 21:08.850
When you're scared,
it helps to think
about something else.

21:09.226 --> 21:11.478
Like something funny?

21:11.561 --> 21:12.688
Sure.

21:12.771 --> 21:14.356
All right,
I got this one.

21:14.439 --> 21:18.610
What did one shark say
to the other shark
after he ate a clown fish?

21:19.945 --> 21:21.697
[blows raspberry]
This tastes funny.

21:21.780 --> 21:25.534
[laughs] Get it?
Clown fish? Tastes funny?

21:25.617 --> 21:27.119
[laughing]

21:27.202 --> 21:29.955
Oh, he's a clown fish
and he's funny...

21:30.038 --> 21:31.623
That one always gets me!

21:31.707 --> 21:34.501
Stuffy, that wasn't
a very nice joke.

21:34.960 --> 21:38.171
You heard Mr. Chomp.
He wouldn't hurt anyone.

21:38.255 --> 21:41.133
[stammering] Actually,
I thought it was pretty funny.

21:41.216 --> 21:42.509
[chuckling]

21:42.592 --> 21:44.761
See, Lambie?
Just 'cause he's scary-looking

21:44.845 --> 21:47.097
doesn't mean he doesn't have
a sense of humor.

21:47.180 --> 21:48.432
Right, buddy?
Right!

21:49.433 --> 21:53.061
Okay. Open wide,
and let's get
this tooth fixed up.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.855
Squeeze my hand
if you need to.

21:54.938 --> 21:56.982
Oh, okay. Ready, Doc.

21:57.607 --> 21:58.900
[groaning]

21:59.818 --> 22:01.862
There. All done.

22:01.945 --> 22:04.614
Wow!
That didn't hurt at all!

22:04.698 --> 22:05.949
[grunting]

22:08.201 --> 22:09.411
Oh! Oh!
Sorry about that.

22:09.494 --> 22:10.704
No problem.

22:13.790 --> 22:15.709
Ah, looks good!

22:16.960 --> 22:18.503
Feels good too!

22:19.004 --> 22:22.299
<span style="style.default_1">♪ I feel better</span>
<span style="style.default_1">So much better ♪</span>

22:22.382 --> 22:25.260
<span style="style.default_1">♪ Thank you, Doc</span>
<span style="style.default_1">For taking all the ouches away ♪</span>

22:25.469 --> 22:27.137
<span style="style.default_1">♪ I didn't feel so good ♪</span>

22:27.220 --> 22:30.140
<span style="style.default_1">♪ Till you fixed me</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Like I knew that you would ♪</span>

22:30.223 --> 22:31.099
Whoo!

22:31.183 --> 22:36.021
<span style="style.default_1">♪ And I feel better</span>
<span style="style.default_1">So much better now ♪</span>

22:36.772 --> 22:38.565
[laughs] Oh, wow.

22:38.648 --> 22:41.401
I feel like I could
chomp anything!

22:43.028 --> 22:45.530
[all screaming]
No, no. Not you!

22:46.156 --> 22:48.200
I'm a sweetheart of a shark,
remember?

22:48.533 --> 22:49.701
[knock on door]
[squeaks]

22:50.035 --> 22:51.536
Toys! Go stuffed!

22:52.871 --> 22:54.581
Time to get
under the covers, Doc.

22:55.165 --> 22:57.084
I was just finishing up
with a patient.

22:57.501 --> 23:00.087
His tooth was really loose
but I fixed it.

23:00.754 --> 23:03.006
Wow! You do good work!

23:08.095 --> 23:10.305
[kisses]
Sweet dreams.

23:12.349 --> 23:13.975
Night, Mom.
[door closes]

23:14.059 --> 23:15.977
[whispering]
Is there room in there
for more?

23:16.061 --> 23:17.270
Come on in.

23:17.354 --> 23:18.480
[all chuckling]

23:18.563 --> 23:20.982
[Chilly] Okay.
[Hallie] Can I get
a little room here?

23:21.066 --> 23:22.651
I-- I won't bite!

23:22.734 --> 23:24.444
But I do snore.

23:24.528 --> 23:26.279
[laughs] Oh.

23:26.363 --> 23:28.156
Stuffy snores too.

23:28.532 --> 23:30.492
Who doesn't?
[all chuckling]

23:32.994 --> 23:34.830
Hey, everybody.
It's Doc here.

23:34.913 --> 23:37.207
<span style="style.default_1">When you're out playing</span>
<span style="style.default_1">on a really hot day,</span>

23:37.290 --> 23:39.543
<span style="style.default_1">what should you</span>
<span style="style.default_1">remember to do?</span>

23:40.252 --> 23:42.254
Hold on!
<span style="style.default_1">Should you give Boppy a hug?</span>

23:42.587 --> 23:44.381
Whoo hoo!
[all giggling]

23:45.423 --> 23:47.092
[Doc] <span style="style.default_1">Should you trumpet</span>
<span style="style.default_1">like an elephant?</span>

23:47.551 --> 23:48.969
[trumpeting]

23:49.052 --> 23:51.304
<span style="style.default_1">Or should you drink</span>
<span style="style.default_1">plenty of water?</span>

23:52.013 --> 23:55.642
<span style="style.default_1">That's right, on a hot day</span>
<span style="style.default_1">drink lots of water.</span>

23:57.936 --> 23:58.937
[chuckles]
