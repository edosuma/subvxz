00:55.227 --> 01:00.191
[cell phone chimes]

01:02.067 --> 01:03.944
It's hard to breathe, isn't it?

01:04.028 --> 01:07.281
- Maybe I'll wash my hair.
- Why?

01:08.157 --> 01:09.992
It's what people do.

01:11.911 --> 01:13.996
I don't feel like a person.

01:14.079 --> 01:15.665
Me neither.

01:17.124 --> 01:20.753
- Maybe I'll crawl into bed.
- Or a hole.

01:20.837 --> 01:23.756
I'd like to crawl into
one of those for about a month.

01:23.840 --> 01:27.426
- I don't know what to do.
- Breathe.

01:27.510 --> 01:28.887
[inhales deeply]

01:28.969 --> 01:30.346
[exhales deeply]

01:31.848 --> 01:35.226
This is the first time in 20 years
I feel like I could breathe.

01:35.309 --> 01:38.479
I would like to climb out on the roof

01:38.563 --> 01:42.066
and shout out, "I am a homosexual

01:42.149 --> 01:46.738
in love with Robert Hanson,
who is also a homosexual."

01:46.821 --> 01:50.199
Okay, well, let's have breakfast first.

01:50.282 --> 01:54.871
And then go to work.
And then... let's not do that.

01:59.208 --> 02:01.419
[bowl dings]

02:02.670 --> 02:05.840
[cell phone chimes]

02:09.594 --> 02:11.763
He's gonna keep calling!

02:11.846 --> 02:14.640
I'm gonna keep not answering.

02:14.724 --> 02:17.977
Won't be as satisfying as hanging up
on him would be,

02:18.060 --> 02:21.063
but I'll journal
my disappointment later.

02:23.023 --> 02:24.943
[sighs]

02:25.025 --> 02:28.821
Just because we're out now doesn't mean
we're going to be gay with a vengeance.

02:28.905 --> 02:30.322
I know.

02:30.406 --> 02:31.950
So...

02:33.534 --> 02:36.829
- [laughing]
- What time is the deposition?

02:39.498 --> 02:41.542
[loud crunching]

02:46.798 --> 02:48.173
[sighs]

02:58.559 --> 03:02.229
[tribal music playing]

03:02.313 --> 03:04.315
[male voice chanting]

03:13.532 --> 03:16.452
[sighs, whimpers]

03:24.460 --> 03:25.878
[groans]

03:38.057 --> 03:40.309
- [Frankie blowing nose]
- Are you still here?

03:40.392 --> 03:41.477
[doorbell rings]

03:41.560 --> 03:43.938
- What the heck?
- No. Don't answer it.

03:45.230 --> 03:48.026
- Who is it?
- Whoever it is, don't let them in.

03:48.108 --> 03:49.735
[woman] It's us, honey. Me and Jason.

03:49.819 --> 03:52.697
[Jason] "Jason and I." Apparently,
Amanda never went to high school.

03:52.780 --> 03:56.367
We're here just to give you a hug
and make sure you're okay.

03:56.450 --> 03:58.036
Not okay! Not okay!

03:58.118 --> 04:00.538
Can you hold on a second?
I'll be right with you.

04:00.621 --> 04:03.207
- What is your problem?
- What are they doing here?

04:03.290 --> 04:07.461
- They dropped by to see me.
- Who drops by?

04:07.545 --> 04:09.797
You call. You make a plan.

04:09.881 --> 04:13.133
You set it up weeks in advance
and then you cancel three times.

04:13.217 --> 04:16.261
Shouldn't they leave you alone
and give you some space

04:16.345 --> 04:19.557
out of respect for our situation?
Isn't that what we need right now?

04:19.640 --> 04:23.185
No, we need people who know
what we need, because we don't.

04:23.268 --> 04:25.312
That's why they're called friends.

04:25.396 --> 04:27.982
Well, I'm not sure that's why
they're called friends.

04:28.066 --> 04:30.442
It's a German word, I think.

04:30.526 --> 04:33.362
I can't recall the origin,
I took a course...

04:33.445 --> 04:35.489
Here, come on down, kids.

04:35.573 --> 04:37.909
[cell phone ringing]

04:37.992 --> 04:40.160
[Grace] Put the phone in the cradle!

04:42.080 --> 04:44.957
- Mal!
- Hey, Mom. How are you?

04:45.041 --> 04:48.502
Oh, I don't know, I'm just...

04:48.586 --> 04:51.756
Madison! No! Don't... don't touch that.

04:51.839 --> 04:54.008
The box clearly states
ages six and over.

04:54.092 --> 04:55.718
Sorry, go ahead, Mom. Sorry.

04:55.801 --> 05:00.098
There are people in my house.
Can you believe it? People!

05:05.603 --> 05:08.397
Frankie's friends thought it was okay
to just drop by.

05:08.480 --> 05:11.567
- Wait, Frankie is still there?
- I know. Right?

05:11.650 --> 05:13.444
- Frankie?
- Hi, guys.

05:13.527 --> 05:16.697
Oh, dear God.
Let me comb your hair.

05:16.781 --> 05:20.242
Oh, honey, you look terrible.
Fuck.

05:20.325 --> 05:21.410
[Jason chuckles]

05:21.493 --> 05:23.328
Thank you.

05:25.247 --> 05:29.085
- I... It's just, I feel... It's hard.
- Yes.

05:29.168 --> 05:32.463
And everybody tries to...
But it doesn't work. Because there...

05:32.546 --> 05:35.257
It's the words...
There are no words...

05:35.340 --> 05:39.595
"Bullshit" comes to mind.
But... I'm so tired.

05:39.678 --> 05:42.264
- Well, you just lean on us today.
- [Jason] Yes,

05:42.347 --> 05:45.517
like I leaned on you when Amanda
broke up my relationship with Josh.

05:45.601 --> 05:48.520
Well, I'm pretty sure he stole
the silverware out of my house.

05:48.604 --> 05:50.982
It was flatware and he did you a favor.

05:51.065 --> 05:55.360
Now, do you want to vent, you want
to scrapbook, you wanna get revenge?

05:55.444 --> 05:56.904
Who told you about Sol?

05:57.696 --> 06:00.491
- Sol told us.
- He's just worried about you.

06:00.574 --> 06:04.411
Such a humanitarian. I can't wait
to see his concert with Bono.

06:04.495 --> 06:06.622
I've got to get her out of here.

06:06.705 --> 06:09.291
Well, Mom, maybe she just needs
a little nudge.

06:09.374 --> 06:11.710
- That's what Brianna said.
- Brianna actually called you?

06:11.794 --> 06:15.923
No. Texted. And I don't
even think it was meant for me.

06:16.007 --> 06:18.926
It started with "'Sup, bee-yotch?"

06:19.010 --> 06:22.429
Took my thumbs twenty minutes
to type back "Wrong bee-yotch."

06:22.513 --> 06:25.307
Ha! Good one, mom.

06:25.390 --> 06:26.851
[Frankie] Grace?

06:26.934 --> 06:29.311
Oh, my God. They're coming.
I gotta go hide. Bye.

06:29.394 --> 06:31.563
Grace! Come say hello.

06:31.647 --> 06:35.776
Hi, Grace. Jason and I
want to take you girls to lunch.

06:35.860 --> 06:37.236
Oh, no thanks.

06:37.319 --> 06:39.488
- You have to eat.
- Yeah.

06:39.571 --> 06:41.949
No. No, actually, she doesn't.

06:42.033 --> 06:45.452
Come on, go with us, okay,
because I can help you.

06:45.536 --> 06:49.040
Have you gotten a lawyer yet?
Because I know every lawyer in the state.

06:49.123 --> 06:51.667
And she should. She's used most of them.

06:51.750 --> 06:54.879
[Amanda] Nope. Uh-uh.

06:54.962 --> 06:57.756
Oh, here's the one for you:
Shirley O'Reilly.

06:57.840 --> 07:02.302
Irish. He's always been
afraid of Irish women.

07:02.386 --> 07:03.679
His mother was Irish.

07:03.762 --> 07:06.932
Well, that's good,
because Shirley is the best.

07:07.016 --> 07:10.310
She will have Robert's lawyer
crying in the parking lot in his car.

07:10.394 --> 07:14.148
Well, I'm putting this one
on the top of the pile.

07:14.232 --> 07:16.316
No, no, no, wait.

07:16.400 --> 07:17.609
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no, no.

07:17.693 --> 07:19.778
- We're supposed to be taking you.
- It's on us. It's on us.

07:19.862 --> 07:23.657
Please. Your advice
has saved me hundreds in billable hours.

07:26.744 --> 07:28.579
Did you guys know about Sol?

07:28.662 --> 07:29.955
No!

07:30.039 --> 07:31.957
Did everyone know?
Was I the only one who didn't?

07:32.041 --> 07:33.751
I was shocked. I swear.

07:36.503 --> 07:37.838
I think everyone is gay.

07:37.922 --> 07:39.464
[Amanda] Nobody knew, Frankie.

07:39.548 --> 07:41.633
We all thought you and Sol
were the perfect couple.

07:41.717 --> 07:43.135
[cell phone chimes]

07:43.219 --> 07:44.595
Stop calling!

07:44.678 --> 07:48.015
Ma'am.
Your credit card was declined.

07:48.099 --> 07:50.726
What are you talking about?
That's never happened to me...

07:52.019 --> 07:54.021
Oh, no.

07:54.105 --> 07:55.231
[quietly] Oh, my God.

07:55.314 --> 07:59.110
He wouldn't. Oh, that bastard.

07:59.193 --> 08:00.694
Try yours.

08:00.778 --> 08:02.863
- What?
- Here. Give him your credit card!

08:02.947 --> 08:05.365
But... our friends
are taking us to lunch.

08:05.449 --> 08:07.701
- Sir!
- No, no, no, no, no.

08:07.785 --> 08:09.912
- Grace!
- Found my sunglasses.

08:09.995 --> 08:11.205
[Amanda] Please, just...

08:16.168 --> 08:18.879
Grace, what the hell is going on?

08:18.963 --> 08:21.757
Robert cut off my credit card.

08:21.840 --> 08:23.008
Why?

08:23.092 --> 08:26.971
That way you can't make a big purchase
until the assets are split up.

08:27.054 --> 08:29.765
Like a "fuck you Lexus."

08:29.848 --> 08:31.809
Or lunch, apparently.

08:31.892 --> 08:33.769
Sol wouldn't do that to me.

08:33.852 --> 08:36.230
I never should have let you
convince me to do this.

08:36.313 --> 08:38.440
Sol, we didn't do anything wrong.

08:38.523 --> 08:41.400
We just did what we'd advise anyone
to do in this situation.

08:41.485 --> 08:44.363
Frankie isn't "anyone."
I should have warned her.

08:46.573 --> 08:48.659
We talk about everything.

08:48.742 --> 08:51.703
That's how we do things.
Did things.

08:51.787 --> 08:54.539
- Do things!
- You tried calling her.

08:54.623 --> 08:58.627
How can she expect you to tell her
something if she won't answer your calls?

08:58.710 --> 09:00.796
That's not fair.

09:00.879 --> 09:02.256
[sighs]

09:03.715 --> 09:05.926
This is a terrible feeling.

09:07.761 --> 09:09.638
So which is better...

09:09.721 --> 09:12.683
terrible with me, or terrible without?

09:12.766 --> 09:13.934
Terrible with.

09:17.021 --> 09:18.230
Then trust me.

09:18.314 --> 09:21.692
Yeah.
Uh, this one isn't good either.

09:25.112 --> 09:26.697
That gray-haired prick.

09:26.780 --> 09:28.240
Which one?

09:28.324 --> 09:31.160
Sir, please come get it.

09:31.243 --> 09:34.079
I worked very hard for this card.
Thank you very much.

09:34.163 --> 09:37.041
So, the guys are moving fast.

09:37.124 --> 09:39.501
- Are they living together yet?
- No.

09:39.584 --> 09:41.461
Sol's very old-fashioned.

09:41.545 --> 09:45.216
Okay, you need to get in your homes.
Take possession.

09:45.299 --> 09:47.801
That way, they cannot kick you out
if you're in there.

09:47.885 --> 09:51.805
I don't want my home.
It was always more his than mine.

09:51.889 --> 09:53.557
The beach house, on the other hand...

09:53.640 --> 09:56.643
I love my house. I raised my boys there.

09:56.727 --> 09:59.771
Everything good that ever happened to me
happened in that house.

09:59.855 --> 10:01.232
You should go there.

10:01.315 --> 10:02.441
- Right, Amanda?
- Yes.

10:02.524 --> 10:04.568
You should go live there.
Amanda says!

10:04.651 --> 10:07.321
- And she's been divorced three times.
- Three.

10:07.405 --> 10:09.698
- Go take your house.
- Yes.

10:09.781 --> 10:11.909
- Come on, right now!
- Yes!

10:11.992 --> 10:13.911
Put your shoes on.

10:14.745 --> 10:17.956
- You cut off their credit cards?!
- I know. Terrible.

10:18.040 --> 10:21.335
- She's going to see it as a hostile act.
- Maybe because it is a hostile act.

10:21.419 --> 10:23.879
[Robert] Maybe her not calling you back
is a hostile act.

10:23.962 --> 10:27.632
Or worse, a tactic. To keep you
from moving forward with the divorce.

10:27.716 --> 10:28.717
She's not that devious.

10:28.800 --> 10:31.636
No, but right about now,
she's gonna be pretty pissed.

10:31.720 --> 10:35.015
Bud, the only reason we did this

10:35.099 --> 10:39.019
is because Frankie
has a history of impulsive spendings.

10:39.103 --> 10:41.230
Excuse me, that is my mother
you're talking about.

10:41.313 --> 10:42.856
It's not a judgment.

10:42.940 --> 10:46.235
Some people are...
emotional purchasers.

10:46.318 --> 10:47.611
Nothing big.

10:47.694 --> 10:51.698
When Coyote went into rehab
she bought a ten thousand dollar yurt.

10:51.782 --> 10:53.784
And when you left for college...
what was it she got?

10:53.867 --> 10:56.203
Depressed. And an alpaca.

10:56.287 --> 10:58.538
But she did crochet
hats for everyone at Hanukkah.

10:58.622 --> 11:00.707
We just don't want any of that.

11:00.791 --> 11:04.669
Now, as soon as you're able to
get in touch with her you'll feel better.

11:04.753 --> 11:07.172
[phone ringing]

11:07.256 --> 11:10.008
- Hello?
- [Frankie] Fuck you, Sol!

11:10.092 --> 11:12.886
I'm going to my house.
Did you hear that? My house.

11:12.970 --> 11:15.597
And you know what else?
I'm going to hang up on you.

11:17.849 --> 11:19.393
God, that felt good.

11:19.477 --> 11:23.314
[Sol] Frankie? Frankie? You okay?
What happened?

11:23.397 --> 11:24.856
Nothing. Bye.

11:28.026 --> 11:29.861
Mal? I need you to do me a favor.

11:29.945 --> 11:33.282
Go to the house and bring some things
over to Frankie's. ASAP.

11:33.365 --> 11:37.369
Wait? You're moving into Frankie's?

11:37.453 --> 11:39.997
Yeah, I've gone insane. No!

11:40.080 --> 11:44.168
I'm settling Frankie into her house and
then I'm going back to the beach. Alone.

11:44.251 --> 11:46.504
Finally. With my stuff.

11:46.586 --> 11:50.757
- That you are gonna put into my car.
- Uh... Okay. Um...

11:50.841 --> 11:52.676
- Now?
- Yes, now.

11:52.759 --> 11:55.137
Okay. No problem.

11:55.220 --> 11:57.889
I am...
I am totally there for you, Mom.

11:57.973 --> 12:01.685
Yep. I am just going to call Mitch,

12:01.768 --> 12:04.563
and tell him to pick up the kids
from Natalie's.

12:04.646 --> 12:06.731
And, uh... shit.

12:06.815 --> 12:09.318
I was supposed to pick up Brianna
from the car place.

12:09.401 --> 12:10.777
Okay, you know what? No problem.

12:10.861 --> 12:13.489
I'm just gonna feed the dog and then

12:13.572 --> 12:17.117
I will do my kegels in the car.
Uh-huh, okay.

12:17.201 --> 12:20.912
- Go ahead, Mom, give me your list.
- My make-up bag, a couple of outfits...

12:20.996 --> 12:24.916
My good purses, my jewelry box...
Grandma's afghan...

12:25.000 --> 12:27.669
- Yeah... right.
- A book on my nightstand, my slippers...

12:27.752 --> 12:29.505
And... Oh, gosh, bye.

12:29.588 --> 12:30.922
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

12:31.006 --> 12:33.467
Thank you for everything.

12:33.551 --> 12:36.303
I think that's okay for now.
Thanks, hon, bye.

12:36.387 --> 12:38.389
Ah...

12:38.472 --> 12:40.432
- I'm two drinks in.
- Okay.

12:54.613 --> 12:56.907
I don't get it.
Why does she only call you?

12:56.990 --> 12:59.535
She never ever calls me
if she needs something.

12:59.618 --> 13:02.037
You didn't even call her once this week.

13:02.120 --> 13:06.500
Texting is the new calling. And I even
used a smiley face with heart-shaped eyes.

13:06.584 --> 13:09.086
If that doesn't say love,
I don't know what does.

13:09.169 --> 13:13.382
And do you see a connection
as to why she might not reach out to you?

13:15.175 --> 13:16.843
...ish.

13:26.228 --> 13:27.229
Look.

13:28.606 --> 13:29.814
What?

13:33.777 --> 13:37.448
- Yeah. I guess Hildy hasn't come yet.
- No. French toast.

13:37.531 --> 13:39.199
So?

13:39.283 --> 13:42.744
Dad can't cook.
Sol must've stayed here last night.

13:43.912 --> 13:46.915
[sighs] Oh.

13:47.583 --> 13:50.794
[line ringing]

13:50.877 --> 13:53.880
[cell phone ringing]

13:54.590 --> 13:57.468
- Hello?
- [Nwabudike] Hey, man, how's it going?

13:57.551 --> 14:01.221
Well, I spent half the day wearing
a Post-it note that says,

14:01.305 --> 14:03.265
"All my dreams are dead."

14:03.348 --> 14:04.766
Oh, it's nice they got to know you.

14:04.849 --> 14:06.602
[laughs]

14:06.685 --> 14:09.605
No, no, look, look.
Listen, Mom is really upset

14:09.688 --> 14:13.024
about Dad starting the divorce stuff,
and she's not even talking to him.

14:13.108 --> 14:15.527
So naturally,
he's going over there to try to talk...

14:15.611 --> 14:18.947
Well, Dad's really good at stuff.
He'll be able to calm her down.

14:19.030 --> 14:20.532
Robert's going too.

14:21.700 --> 14:23.452
Well, that's gonna be a shit show.

14:23.535 --> 14:26.664
- Exactly.
- She's gonna end up buying a Winnebago.

14:26.746 --> 14:29.040
Oh-ho-ho. She can't.
They cut off her credit cards.

14:29.708 --> 14:31.168
You know, I feel her pain.

14:31.251 --> 14:34.879
Look, um... we promised
that we would be there for her.

14:34.963 --> 14:37.882
And I can't leave work.
So I need you to go.

14:37.966 --> 14:39.884
- Really?
- Yes.

14:41.052 --> 14:44.889
Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I can do that.

14:44.973 --> 14:47.434
Let me just take a look
at the bus map...

14:47.518 --> 14:50.395
- Oh, fuck. Right.
- What?

14:50.479 --> 14:51.938
You still can't drive.

14:52.022 --> 14:54.608
No, I can drive.

14:54.692 --> 14:57.611
The DMV has asked me not to drive...

14:57.695 --> 15:00.197
for 214 more days.

15:00.280 --> 15:01.573
I'll send a car over.

15:08.788 --> 15:09.956
[bells jingle]

15:10.040 --> 15:11.791
Why don't you just go in?

15:11.875 --> 15:13.960
I don't want her to feel like
I'm barging in.

15:14.044 --> 15:16.714
This is your house. You still live here.

15:22.844 --> 15:25.764
Grace, Robert's here!

15:25.847 --> 15:28.350
Frankie, Frankie...

15:28.433 --> 15:31.269
[Frankie] I reject your presence here.
You are invisible to me.

15:31.353 --> 15:35.399
I'm sorry. I should never have
let this happen before talking to you.

15:35.482 --> 15:37.609
Oh, I'm confused.

15:37.693 --> 15:41.780
Are we talking about
the affair or the credit cards?

15:43.490 --> 15:48.245
Oh, by the way.
You got a box from Zappos. I ran over it.

15:48.328 --> 15:49.747
I saw.

15:52.832 --> 15:53.917
Hello, Grace.

15:57.671 --> 15:59.130
[sighs]

16:00.591 --> 16:02.300
What are you doing here?

16:02.384 --> 16:06.930
- I... just came with Sol.
- Yeah. I put that together.

16:08.807 --> 16:10.850
Thanks for the heads up
on the credit card.

16:10.934 --> 16:13.144
I'm sorry. But you know how this works.

16:13.228 --> 16:15.731
You were married
to a divorce lawyer for forty years.

16:15.814 --> 16:18.858
Yeah, exactly.

16:18.942 --> 16:23.113
If you want war,
I can call Shirley O'Reilly right now.

16:23.196 --> 16:27.743
Shirley O'Reilly? I heard she punched
a service dog in the face once.

16:29.244 --> 16:31.996
This is really hard, all this.

16:32.914 --> 16:36.209
I mean, we can beat each other up
and make this really painful.

16:36.293 --> 16:39.296
- We can become "those people."
- You know I don't want that.

16:39.379 --> 16:40.880
Well, what do you want?

16:42.090 --> 16:43.425
[sighs]

16:43.508 --> 16:46.470
Because this isn't your client's witchy
wife on the other side of the table.

16:46.553 --> 16:47.805
Or some psycho husband.

16:49.180 --> 16:52.225
This time, the person
on the other side of the table is me.

16:52.309 --> 16:54.185
The woman that you were married to
for forty years.

16:54.269 --> 16:56.772
The woman that raised your children.

16:56.855 --> 16:59.483
I'm the one on the other side
of the table.

16:59.566 --> 17:02.527
So how do you want to handle this?

17:05.195 --> 17:07.031
[sighs]

17:07.115 --> 17:09.409
I don't know.

17:09.492 --> 17:13.204
I've been a divorce lawyer
nearly all my adult life...

17:13.288 --> 17:17.501
and I have absolutely no idea
how I'm gonna handle this one.

17:19.419 --> 17:23.131
Yeah. I know.

17:25.425 --> 17:28.762
I was trying to call you
to talk you through the process.

17:30.013 --> 17:33.558
- Will you look at me, please?
- Excuse me, I'm reading.

17:33.642 --> 17:36.770
You're not reading.
Popular Woodworking?

17:36.854 --> 17:38.188
I have surprises too, Sol.

17:38.271 --> 17:40.899
You're not the only one
with a secret life.

17:40.982 --> 17:42.734
You're a secret woodworker?

17:42.818 --> 17:47.071
[groans] What I hate is that barely
a week after you've wrecked my life,

17:47.155 --> 17:51.284
you've already moved on to the legal...
and to lawyers and...

17:51.368 --> 17:52.828
and stopping credit cards...

17:52.911 --> 17:55.664
As soon as I serve you and you respond,

17:55.747 --> 17:58.375
you start getting
temporary spousal support.

17:58.458 --> 18:00.251
And that's really good.

18:00.335 --> 18:03.129
It's always better
than the regular support.

18:03.213 --> 18:05.298
So you're gonna screw me over
in the regular support?

18:05.382 --> 18:08.218
No! I want you to screw me over!

18:08.301 --> 18:13.473
Have your lawyer rake me over
the coals and light my hair on fire.

18:13.557 --> 18:16.309
I guess that might happen naturally
in that context.

18:16.393 --> 18:17.686
Not helping.

18:19.938 --> 18:24.359
She is not gonna be happy
that we put her stuff in trash bags.

18:24.442 --> 18:26.778
I'll text her a beautiful apology.

18:28.530 --> 18:30.448
Thank you for helping.

18:32.450 --> 18:33.702
You're welcome!

18:34.703 --> 18:38.540
Can you slow down for two seconds
and wait for your sister?

18:38.623 --> 18:40.667
By the way,
I'm not going in there when we...

18:40.751 --> 18:41.710
- [Mallory] Yes, you are.
- [Brianna] No.

18:41.793 --> 18:43.921
- [Mallory] We're checking on Mom.
- [Brianna] I'm sitting on a rock.

18:44.003 --> 18:45.004
Bree?

18:50.969 --> 18:52.262
Oh, Jesus.

18:52.345 --> 18:54.222
Coyote's out of rehab?

18:54.305 --> 18:55.515
You didn't know?

18:56.767 --> 19:00.562
- No.
- He's been crashing on Bud's couch.

19:00.645 --> 19:03.064
- He's... he's living there?
- Yeah.

19:03.147 --> 19:07.527
So you haven't seen him since he went
all Stanley Kowalski on your front lawn?

19:07.611 --> 19:11.114
Oh, this is gonna be good. Coyote!

19:11.197 --> 19:13.074
- Hey!
- Hi, Bree.

19:13.157 --> 19:15.201
- Good to see you!
- Good to see you, too!

19:15.994 --> 19:19.831
So... what exactly is going on in there?

19:19.915 --> 19:24.669
I don't know, but out here,
Mallory just found out that you're back.

19:24.753 --> 19:26.129
'Scuse me.

19:27.672 --> 19:30.508
- Hi, Mal.
- No.

19:31.760 --> 19:33.678
- We can't talk...?
- No.

19:36.222 --> 19:38.349
Okay.

19:38.433 --> 19:40.685
- I'm gonna go in there.
- No! Why would you do that?

19:40.769 --> 19:43.396
Because our dads cut off
our moms' credit cards.

19:43.480 --> 19:46.691
They cut off their credit car...
I'm not talking to you.

19:46.775 --> 19:49.277
- They cut off our moms' credit cards.
- Come on, Mallory!

19:49.360 --> 19:50.445
No!

19:50.528 --> 19:54.115
I don't even know exactly
what I did that night, okay?

19:54.198 --> 19:57.535
I... I mean,
I know that there were cops involved...

19:57.619 --> 19:59.830
and I know that there was a...

20:01.414 --> 20:03.374
I know that there was a car mishap.

20:05.168 --> 20:06.628
But I...

20:06.711 --> 20:10.507
Seriously?
You're really gonna do this right now?

20:10.590 --> 20:13.551
You're really gonna make this
about you when this is the first time

20:13.635 --> 20:16.513
that the four of them have been
together since...

20:16.596 --> 20:17.722
you know...

20:17.806 --> 20:19.891
- Gay-maggedon?
- [car door closes]

20:19.975 --> 20:22.978
- Arma-gayden? Is that better?
- That is better.

20:23.061 --> 20:25.480
[Nwabudike] Hey, guys.

20:25.563 --> 20:28.025
- Hey.
- How's it going?

20:28.107 --> 20:30.193
Good to see you.
So why aren't you in there?

20:30.276 --> 20:32.821
What are you doing here?
You told me to take care of this.

20:32.904 --> 20:36.366
Well, I know. I mean,
I'm just, you know... I'm back-up.

20:36.449 --> 20:39.243
You're full of shit.
You didn't trust me.

20:39.327 --> 20:41.621
Well, you are standing out here.
Which is not what I asked you to do.

20:41.705 --> 20:43.748
Fine. I'm going inside.

20:43.832 --> 20:45.876
No! No! Why would you do that?

20:45.959 --> 20:49.462
Why? It's so fun outside!

20:49.546 --> 20:52.340
And they're adults.
No one asked us to go in there.

20:52.423 --> 20:53.800
Technically, I did ask him.

20:53.884 --> 20:55.259
Do you really think we should
stay out here?

20:55.343 --> 20:57.595
Or you just don't want
to deal with this right now?

20:58.972 --> 21:00.348
Two things can be true.

21:00.431 --> 21:01.391
[sighs]

21:01.474 --> 21:03.351
[car approaches, horn honking]

21:05.896 --> 21:09.858
What the hell is he doing here?

21:09.941 --> 21:11.317
Mitch is here.

21:11.401 --> 21:14.195
Here's what we're going to do.
You're going to give me the beach house.

21:14.278 --> 21:15.613
You're going to take our house.

21:15.697 --> 21:18.449
I'm not going to yell,
I'm not going to threaten,

21:18.533 --> 21:20.035
you're not going to cut anything off,

21:20.118 --> 21:22.203
and you're not going to
use my words against me,

21:22.286 --> 21:25.498
and you're not going to win
an argument just 'cause you can.

21:25.582 --> 21:28.043
God, I'm an asshole.

21:28.126 --> 21:30.754
Is that a yes?

21:30.837 --> 21:32.797
Yes.

21:32.881 --> 21:34.465
I want you to have the beach house.

21:34.549 --> 21:38.011
And I'll do everything I can to make
that happen, and I'll take our house.

21:38.095 --> 21:40.889
Although, when you think
about the resale value...

21:42.099 --> 21:44.475
Asshole. Got it.

21:46.603 --> 21:49.272
- Hey, boo boos!
- Hey.

21:50.899 --> 21:51.900
What are you doing here?

21:51.983 --> 21:55.278
You told me to pick up the kids.

21:55.361 --> 21:57.488
Pick up the kids and take them home.

21:57.572 --> 22:01.200
Was that not implied when I told you
I wanted you to pick up the kids?

22:01.284 --> 22:04.871
You said you were going to Frankie's
and that I should...

22:06.915 --> 22:11.252
Right. Right, that was implied.
I'm an idiot.

22:11.335 --> 22:13.964
All right. I'll...
I'll take the kids home

22:14.047 --> 22:16.007
like someone
who understands English would.

22:16.091 --> 22:17.341
Hey, Mitch.

22:18.509 --> 22:23.222
I'm really sorry for whatever
I did that night. Addiction is a disease.

22:23.306 --> 22:26.350
You're a doctor! You understand diseases!

22:26.434 --> 22:28.352
Hi, Maddie.

22:28.436 --> 22:32.398
Okay, anybody up for a drink?
Other than the alcoholic?

22:32.482 --> 22:34.943
I am. I'm in.

22:35.026 --> 22:37.154
Me, too.

22:37.236 --> 22:39.572
Oh, you mean now?

22:39.656 --> 22:42.200
I really... I really should stay
and talk to Mom.

22:42.283 --> 22:45.244
No, let me. Please.

22:45.328 --> 22:48.165
You asked me to take care of Mom,
let me take care of Mom.

22:54.754 --> 22:57.381
Let's drink at my place
so I can walk home.

23:02.553 --> 23:05.098
Frankie, I fucked up in a lot of ways.

23:05.182 --> 23:06.933
But we're trying to do this right.

23:07.017 --> 23:11.146
I get great comfort hearing
that about you and your boyfriend.

23:11.229 --> 23:15.441
I know. I know how it sounds.

23:15.525 --> 23:18.236
But Robert and I spent hours
discussing how to do this

23:18.319 --> 23:20.363
in the fairest possible way.

23:20.446 --> 23:23.533
- When?
- When... what?

23:23.616 --> 23:25.702
When were you
and Robert discussing this?

23:25.785 --> 23:27.829
Was it last week or the week before?

23:27.912 --> 23:29.998
I don't know...

23:30.081 --> 23:34.794
Were you talking about it last Saturday
when you and I were sitting in this room?

23:34.878 --> 23:38.256
You know, about going to the farmer's
market, maybe catching a movie...

23:38.339 --> 23:41.926
Was that when you and Robert
were deciding to cut off my credit card?

23:42.010 --> 23:44.221
No! I didn't even want
to cut off the card!

23:44.303 --> 23:45.680
But you did.

23:45.763 --> 23:48.725
Because Robert was worried
about your spending.

23:52.395 --> 23:54.689
[Frankie] Get out of my house.

23:54.772 --> 23:57.567
I don't want to look at you.
Go live with Robert.

23:57.650 --> 24:01.946
Okay... okay.

24:02.030 --> 24:03.781
I hear you.

24:03.865 --> 24:07.160
- Let me just get my stuff...
- Don't bother. I'm burning it anyway.

24:07.244 --> 24:10.538
- We weren't really ready to move in.
- Oh, boo-hoo.

24:10.621 --> 24:12.498
Sleep in the yurt, for all I care.

24:13.958 --> 24:15.085
Let's go, Sol.

24:19.756 --> 24:21.674
We should leave.

24:23.051 --> 24:25.386
Don't be mad at him, Frankie.

24:25.469 --> 24:28.306
It's my fault. I'm an asshole.

24:28.389 --> 24:30.267
[sarcastic laugh]

24:38.942 --> 24:41.319
Your mom was great today.

24:41.402 --> 24:45.656
She really stood up for herself
with your father.

24:45.740 --> 24:48.409
And she's gonna get this house.

24:48.492 --> 24:51.079
There's a strong woman
under all that soft fabric.

24:51.162 --> 24:54.124
- Yeah.
- Some people don't realize that.

24:54.207 --> 24:57.418
She'd have to be, given
what you've put her through.

25:00.088 --> 25:01.339
Yeah.

25:01.422 --> 25:03.216
She's all set in the food department.

25:03.300 --> 25:07.845
And... Oh, a bag of pot!

25:07.929 --> 25:11.015
She's going to be just fine.

25:11.099 --> 25:13.517
Really wish you hadn't told me
about the bag of pot.

25:15.270 --> 25:18.648
You're all set, Frankie.
There's enough food in there for an army.

25:18.731 --> 25:21.692
So... Yeah, I'll get out of your way...

25:21.776 --> 25:24.070
[crying] Was any of it real?

25:27.031 --> 25:30.160
You're going to make
new memories, Frankie.

25:30.243 --> 25:33.997
New and better memories.
And you can reuse the frames!

25:36.082 --> 25:38.793
Okay... so I'm going to get going.

25:38.876 --> 25:41.254
And... you got food in the fridge...

25:41.338 --> 25:43.298
Well, I already told you that.

25:43.381 --> 25:46.009
So, we'll talk soon.

26:21.919 --> 26:24.088
[Frankie sighs]

26:29.760 --> 26:30.803
[Grace] Are you okay?

26:30.887 --> 26:32.680
[Frankie] Yes, thank you, I will be.

26:32.763 --> 26:36.517
I just need to do what I always
do when I'm blue.

26:36.600 --> 26:39.520
[inhales deeply]

26:39.603 --> 26:43.482
[chants loudly]

26:45.318 --> 26:48.071
[sighs] I hate my life.

26:49.072 --> 26:52.325
[chanting continues]
