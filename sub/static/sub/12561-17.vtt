WEBVTT

00:01.815 --> 00:03.067
Is this an arranged marriage?

00:03.067 --> 00:04.908
What if she gets engaged
and moves to London,

00:04.908 --> 00:07.135
- what are we going to do?
- Does it feel right to you?

00:07.135 --> 00:08.495
We have to stop being

00:08.495 --> 00:10.519
emotional about logical decisions.

00:10.519 --> 00:14.079
When we kissed, I felt
nothing except regret.

00:14.079 --> 00:15.840
- You.
- Me.

00:15.840 --> 00:17.628
You shouldn't fake date for money.

00:17.628 --> 00:18.808
Is started out that way,

00:18.808 --> 00:21.461
but then I realized that I
actually liked her, a lot.

00:21.461 --> 00:23.532
This thing you have, it's genetic.

00:23.532 --> 00:24.607
And quite fatal.

00:24.607 --> 00:26.341
- How are you feeling?
- Tired.

00:26.758 --> 00:27.939
Nauseated.

00:28.260 --> 00:29.186
Pregnant.

00:29.186 --> 00:30.226
Keeping something like this from him

00:30.226 --> 00:31.992
can be stressful to you, and maybe...

00:31.992 --> 00:34.051
I will take care of my
relationship with Boris.

00:34.051 --> 00:35.763
Is she going to be all right, or...

00:35.763 --> 00:37.745
you have to talk to Marisa.

00:42.561 --> 00:43.895
Screw emerging markets.

00:43.895 --> 00:46.213
I'll be you would.
I've seen some of your dates.

00:46.907 --> 00:49.639
You just can't live with the
fact that your best friend

00:49.639 --> 00:51.686
out-earned you last quarter.
Let it go!

00:51.686 --> 00:53.375
I still say it was a
typo that stumbled you

00:53.375 --> 00:55.889
into that company two
days before it split.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.551
Well, you'll never know, will you?

00:57.551 --> 01:00.395
Hey, if the "L" train cooperates
we can be in Brooklyn

01:00.395 --> 01:01.946
in 16 minutes and be back online.

01:02.417 --> 01:03.186
Perfect.

01:03.186 --> 01:05.590
Motorcade communications
just hit the tape.

01:05.590 --> 01:08.049
Great, so how do you want to do this?

01:09.949 --> 01:11.777
- Player's choice.
- Player's choice.

01:11.777 --> 01:13.643
The usual?
Commuter bet?

01:13.643 --> 01:15.032
Already ahead of you.

01:15.218 --> 01:17.467
If you lose, you're buying dinner.

01:17.467 --> 01:19.408
If you lose, you're buying dinner

01:19.408 --> 01:21.096
and wearing lipstick.

01:22.011 --> 01:23.492
I'm not going to lose.

01:24.423 --> 01:27.463
I wonder what shade
lipstick you look better in.

01:27.463 --> 01:29.385
Nasdaq or big board.

01:29.385 --> 01:31.026
Harry, you're going to look so pretty.

01:31.026 --> 01:33.317
Dude, even your lipsticks
are work-related?

01:33.439 --> 01:35.812
You need to get off the floor
and up in the air, fast.

01:35.812 --> 01:38.356
Me? When are you ever not trading?

01:38.755 --> 01:40.121
I got my whole life ahead of me.

01:40.335 --> 01:41.495
I can relax when I'm...

01:45.332 --> 01:46.456
oh, no.

01:47.102 --> 01:49.530
You are not getting out
of our bet that easy.

01:50.512 --> 01:51.488
Harry...

01:53.843 --> 01:54.859
Harry?

01:56.000 --> 02:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:05.479 --> 02:08.174
Well, Tokyo opens soon so I need
help covering his accounts.

02:09.157 --> 02:10.907
Exhaustion or something.

02:11.865 --> 02:13.725
I know, it's totally weird.
He just went down.

02:15.335 --> 02:16.254
Uh-huh.

02:16.536 --> 02:18.195
Yeah, I'll call you after
they let me see him.

02:21.557 --> 02:23.318
Overnight trade desk please.

02:24.527 --> 02:26.168
Uh, Ms. Walsh?

02:26.996 --> 02:29.716
Hang on, Bobby.
It's Harry's doctor.

02:30.208 --> 02:31.318
What was your name again?

02:31.560 --> 02:33.073
Uh, doctor Lawson. Hank.

02:33.073 --> 02:34.481
May I speak with you in private?

02:34.481 --> 02:35.633
Well, anything you need to tell me

02:35.633 --> 02:36.957
you can just tell me right here.

02:37.469 --> 02:38.708
I'll call you right back.

02:38.908 --> 02:44.678
Okay, um...
Your friend suffered an aneurysm.

02:44.896 --> 02:46.799
So... how is he?

02:47.172 --> 02:49.311
Well, we did everything we could.

02:50.923 --> 02:53.445
Well, I don't understand.
He's going to be okay, right?

02:56.099 --> 02:57.302
Ms. Walsh.

02:57.996 --> 02:59.542
Your friend is dead.

03:15.789 --> 03:18.156
Hello. Anyone?

03:25.786 --> 03:27.241
Well, well, well.

03:27.823 --> 03:29.082
This is a surprise, I thought

03:29.082 --> 03:30.855
you were at JFK picking Raj up.

03:31.082 --> 03:32.309
Oh, he had to delay.

03:32.309 --> 03:34.761
But he'll be here tomorrow
in time for the Sangeet.

03:35.130 --> 03:36.289
Sangeet?

03:36.587 --> 03:39.711
Otherwise known as the party
for my friends in New York

03:39.795 --> 03:41.565
who are unable to attend
the wedding in London.

03:41.770 --> 03:43.851
Yeah, I'd stick with Sangeet.
A little more succinct.

03:43.851 --> 03:44.229
- Mm-hmm.

03:44.503 --> 03:45.776
You must have a million things to do

03:45.776 --> 03:47.194
before you leave for London next week.

03:47.194 --> 03:48.249
Yeah, I do.

03:48.445 --> 03:50.565
Fortunately, my mother
is taking care of them.

03:50.565 --> 03:51.285
Oh, good.

03:51.665 --> 03:53.208
I could use your opinion, though.

03:53.346 --> 03:54.297
Mm-hmm?

03:55.568 --> 03:57.010
My wedding gift to Raj.

03:59.565 --> 04:00.705
What do you think?

04:00.705 --> 04:02.972
Oh, my God.
I think he'll love it.

04:02.972 --> 04:04.191
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

04:04.191 --> 04:05.287
It's beautiful.

04:06.975 --> 04:08.772
Yeah, I just wonder if
it's personal enough.

04:09.862 --> 04:11.459
You know, when my parents got married,

04:11.666 --> 04:15.190
my mom gave my father a tandem bicycle.

04:15.190 --> 04:15.576
Hmm.

04:15.917 --> 04:17.969
I have such fond
memories of watching them

04:17.969 --> 04:19.464
ride it around together.

04:19.464 --> 04:20.418
That's nice.

04:20.418 --> 04:22.055
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

04:23.708 --> 04:25.900
In any case, I'm ready to work.

04:26.382 --> 04:28.026
I am not sure that will happen here.

04:28.189 --> 04:30.609
The patient doesn't seem to be
home and no one else is around.

04:44.565 --> 04:45.515
Maybe we should...

05:03.102 --> 05:03.961
Hey.

05:04.151 --> 05:05.080
Hello.

05:05.286 --> 05:07.358
Sorry, I hope I didn't
keep you waiting long.

05:08.750 --> 05:09.905
Hankmed, right?

05:10.150 --> 05:13.229
Yes, I'm Hank Lawson.
This is Divya Katdare.

05:14.137 --> 05:15.129
Jess Walsh.

05:15.338 --> 05:16.329
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:16.329 --> 05:18.723
- Pleased to meet you.
- Oh, so proper.

05:18.951 --> 05:20.257
Pleased to meet you too.

05:20.257 --> 05:24.216
I looked up Concierge
Medicine in the Hamptons,

05:24.216 --> 05:25.733
and I recognized your picture.

05:25.937 --> 05:28.966
But you probably don't remember me.

05:29.419 --> 05:31.787
Uh, your face is familiar, but...

05:31.963 --> 05:33.061
right, I probably don't look

05:33.061 --> 05:34.937
so familiar without my BlackBerry.

05:36.475 --> 05:39.106
Yeah, Brooklyn. Last winter.

05:39.106 --> 05:40.308
You worked on my friend, Harry.

05:40.308 --> 05:41.583
Investment banker.

05:41.583 --> 05:42.769
Aneurysm.

05:43.129 --> 05:44.648
Yeah, I remember now.

05:45.919 --> 05:47.019
How can we help you?

05:47.019 --> 05:49.634
Well, let's just say I called
because I want to make sure

05:49.634 --> 05:51.707
what happened to Harry
doesn't happen to me.

05:52.061 --> 05:55.046
Only I'm afraid I'm too late.

06:18.532 --> 06:24.156
=== Sync by YYeTs.net ===
=Corrected by Alice for www.addic7ed.com=

06:25.099 --> 06:29.387
So you felt nauseous,
anxious, dizzy?

06:29.387 --> 06:31.157
Mm-hmm.
I've had trouble sleeping too.

06:31.475 --> 06:32.712
How long has this been going on?

06:33.117 --> 06:34.497
A few weeks.

06:34.682 --> 06:36.509
Since I left Manhattan for good.

06:37.822 --> 06:39.058
It sounds like Harry's death

06:39.058 --> 06:41.095
was sort of a wake-up call for you.

06:41.391 --> 06:43.201
After Harry collapsed and died,

06:43.412 --> 06:45.937
I had to change.

06:45.937 --> 06:47.125
Or I'd be next.

06:49.202 --> 06:51.366
It took a while, but I finally did it.

06:51.801 --> 06:54.049
I quit my job, cashed out,

06:54.049 --> 06:57.351
and spent everything
on a flight school.

06:57.782 --> 06:59.150
Yes, you did.

06:59.599 --> 07:01.270
Well, you wanted to try
to calm things down.

07:01.444 --> 07:02.916
Lead a less stressful life.

07:03.080 --> 07:04.076
Yeah, and here I am,

07:04.076 --> 07:05.736
full of anxiety and unable to sleep.

07:05.900 --> 07:07.696
- Hmm.
- Her blood pressure is high.

07:07.696 --> 07:09.259
190 over 110.

07:09.762 --> 07:10.837
It was lower when I was

07:10.837 --> 07:13.609
jacked up on caffeine
and adrenaline 24-7.

07:14.430 --> 07:15.579
I don't get it.

07:15.745 --> 07:18.663
I've done everything I could
to make a fresh start

07:18.663 --> 07:20.424
and yet I've never felt worse.

07:20.887 --> 07:22.785
Are you on any medications?

07:22.931 --> 07:24.033
Uh-uh, not any more.

07:24.221 --> 07:25.480
Well, what were you taking?

07:25.480 --> 07:27.476
In addition to my blood pressure meds,

07:27.476 --> 07:29.017
the same as everyone else.

07:29.017 --> 07:30.953
Ambien to go to sleep,
caffeine to wake up.

07:30.953 --> 07:32.483
Paxil to make it through the day.

07:32.665 --> 07:35.931
But not since I moved
here, not even the Lasix.

07:36.099 --> 07:38.264
Okay, do your hands
and arms ever tingle?

07:38.969 --> 07:39.958
Sometimes.

07:39.958 --> 07:41.660
Does your vision get blurry?

07:43.024 --> 07:44.273
Sounds like Finish Syndrome.

07:44.273 --> 07:45.656
Yeah, let's get a Chem panel,

07:45.656 --> 07:47.519
including LFT's, as well as a CBC.

07:47.519 --> 07:49.746
Wait, wait. What's "Finish Syndrome"?

07:49.746 --> 07:50.804
It's what happens when you go

07:50.804 --> 07:53.260
cold-turkey off certain
anti-depressants.

07:53.260 --> 07:54.767
You experience flu, nausea,

07:54.767 --> 07:57.377
bouts of imbalance and
sensory disturbance.

07:57.377 --> 08:01.663
What you're going through now
is called SSRI withdrawal.

08:02.246 --> 08:04.406
Jess, didn't your doctor tell you

08:04.406 --> 08:06.808
to gradually wean off of those meds?

08:07.019 --> 08:09.860
Doctor? We self-prescribed.

08:10.031 --> 08:12.384
Traded that stuff like
stocks and bonds.

08:12.567 --> 08:13.895
And then once Harry...

08:14.520 --> 08:18.978
I pretty much avoided all
hospitals and doctors.

08:19.260 --> 08:21.649
Hmm. We're gonna run some labs,

08:21.949 --> 08:24.176
but in the meantime, I'm
putting you back on Paxil.

08:24.176 --> 08:26.065
Which we'll decrease gradually.

08:26.065 --> 08:28.033
I'll also prescribe
an anti-hypertensive.

08:28.033 --> 08:29.487
You should feel better in a few days.

08:30.077 --> 08:31.242
Then I'll be okay.

08:31.370 --> 08:32.607
We'll make sure of it.

08:33.330 --> 08:35.288
And if you have any further
dizziness or nausea,

08:35.288 --> 08:36.846
- please give me a call.
- Okay.

08:37.294 --> 08:38.816
Are these your planes as well?

08:39.134 --> 08:42.029
Yeah, and there are a
couple more by the runway.

08:42.283 --> 08:43.727
- Runway?
- Mm-hmm.

08:43.898 --> 08:45.120
The one in my backyard.

08:45.961 --> 08:47.700
That's quite a backyard.

08:47.864 --> 08:50.789
Well, the plane's gotta have
a place to take off and land.

08:50.998 --> 08:52.289
Yeah, no. Of course they do.

08:52.518 --> 08:55.056
Raj, my fiance, he has always wanted

08:55.056 --> 08:56.337
to learn how to fly.

08:56.515 --> 08:58.011
I could give you both lessons.

08:58.011 --> 09:00.210
Oh, we could use a
hobby to do together.

09:00.427 --> 09:02.081
Stop by tomorrow, I'll give you

09:02.081 --> 09:04.221
a bird's eye view of the Hamptons.

09:04.221 --> 09:06.185
It's magical. How about noon?

09:06.353 --> 09:07.644
Well, let's see if
you're feeling better.

09:07.644 --> 09:09.215
And if your blood pressure's normal.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.435
Okay, so be here by 11:45.

09:11.906 --> 09:15.481
And Hank, would you care to join us?

09:15.481 --> 09:17.893
Yeah. Uh... no,
thank you, I'm good.

09:18.137 --> 09:21.223
Don't tell me you're afraid
of flying in small planes.

09:21.385 --> 09:22.097
Oh, no.

09:22.097 --> 09:24.021
I'm not afraid of
flying in small planes.

09:24.202 --> 09:25.873
I'm afraid of crashing in small planes.

09:27.047 --> 09:28.251
But thank you.

09:34.738 --> 09:37.544
- Boris still doesn't know.
- You need to tell him.

09:37.544 --> 09:39.474
I have tried many times.

09:39.776 --> 09:41.361
But I just get so nervous

09:41.361 --> 09:43.679
I change my mind and say nothing.

09:44.109 --> 09:46.647
Look, if you're waiting
for the perfect moment...

09:46.647 --> 09:48.724
- there is no perfect moment.
- That's right.

09:48.724 --> 09:51.439
And of course the more I
delay, the more anxious I get.

09:52.852 --> 09:54.407
This is not just about Boris.

09:55.457 --> 09:57.095
Something else is going on.

10:05.205 --> 10:06.931
I've always wanted a child.

10:10.485 --> 10:14.504
But to have a child with
the love of my life,

10:15.724 --> 10:17.416
it was little more than a dream.

10:20.601 --> 10:24.137
And now that it's real,
I just want Boris

10:24.137 --> 10:27.255
to be as happy as I am about the baby.

10:29.663 --> 10:32.797
But we both know that that possibility

10:32.797 --> 10:35.783
only completely exists for
as long as he doesn't know.

10:36.252 --> 10:38.305
But that doesn't mean he doesn't
have the right to know.

10:39.021 --> 10:40.054
Yes.

10:43.174 --> 10:45.429
I guess I'll just have
to face the music.

10:46.234 --> 10:47.356
Yes.

10:47.618 --> 10:49.224
But you won't have to face it alone.

10:53.954 --> 10:55.240
I'm sorry, what did you say?

10:57.712 --> 10:58.923
I'm pregnant.

10:59.722 --> 11:01.063
You're going to be a father.

11:05.664 --> 11:06.948
I see.

11:12.351 --> 11:15.104
I'm relieved to know what Hank
has been treating you for.

11:16.851 --> 11:18.803
No, Marisa's completely healthy.

11:20.340 --> 11:21.847
I should go. I'm sure the two of you...

11:22.046 --> 11:23.393
No... stay.

11:29.980 --> 11:32.608
Unfortunately the timing for
this announcement is not ideal.

11:33.819 --> 11:35.259
I have a meeting in Manhattan.

11:48.083 --> 11:51.104
- So... arranged marriage.
- Mm-hmm.

11:51.305 --> 11:52.459
People still do that?

11:52.606 --> 11:54.310
- Yeah, it's tradition.
- Hmm.

11:54.465 --> 11:57.144
Divya and Raj's families
are crazy traditional.

11:57.806 --> 12:00.679
But, you know, maybe it would
be just as weird for them

12:00.679 --> 12:02.340
to go on a date to the
Ice cream Parlor.

12:03.680 --> 12:05.268
I love that you call it a parlor.

12:05.577 --> 12:06.513
What else is it called?

12:06.513 --> 12:07.526
It's an Ice cream Parlor....

12:10.579 --> 12:11.787
You know what else is kind of weird?

12:12.204 --> 12:14.722
That I like strawberry
and mint chip combined?

12:14.905 --> 12:15.995
No, that's adorable.

12:17.830 --> 12:18.644
Um, it's kind of weird that

12:18.644 --> 12:20.410
we've never spent the
whole night together.

12:21.756 --> 12:23.511
- Don't you think?
- Well...

12:24.242 --> 12:26.109
You think I'm a
blanket hog, don't you?

12:26.561 --> 12:27.532
Or are you just worried that

12:27.532 --> 12:28.884
we'll both like the
same side of the bed?

12:28.884 --> 12:30.467
'Cause I'll cook breakfast.

12:30.646 --> 12:32.238
Strawberry and mint chip pancakes,

12:32.238 --> 12:34.101
- that's my specialty.
- Hm.

12:36.649 --> 12:38.528
- Evan...
- Yeah?

12:39.700 --> 12:42.391
There's something I have to tell you.

12:45.277 --> 12:47.876
Okay. Tell me.

12:49.890 --> 12:50.828
I...

12:53.264 --> 12:54.720
snore.

12:55.504 --> 12:57.790
You snore... that's it?

12:58.105 --> 12:59.878
That's why you haven't spent the night?

13:00.059 --> 13:01.903
Well, yeah.
But you can't tell anyone.

13:01.903 --> 13:03.427
It's really embarrassing.

13:03.427 --> 13:04.738
Oh, Paige.

13:05.250 --> 13:06.534
Oh, my God.

13:06.978 --> 13:08.484
You're staying the night.

13:09.214 --> 13:11.953
Come on, you snore.
How bad could it possibly be?

13:26.628 --> 13:27.625
Hey, Paige.

13:28.597 --> 13:29.991
Paige, Paige...

13:38.039 --> 13:40.023
Hey Boris, it's me again.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.775
Listen, I understand
you're still in Manhattan

13:42.775 --> 13:44.602
but when you get a chance
I'd really like to talk.

13:44.758 --> 13:45.664
Thanks.

13:46.370 --> 13:47.565
You're up early.

13:47.838 --> 13:49.940
Oh yeah, that would
assume I've been to sleep.

13:50.697 --> 13:52.228
Nice, coffee, that was
so thoughtful of you.

13:52.228 --> 13:53.147
No, no, that's mine.

13:53.735 --> 13:55.434
All right, I'm good.
I'm good, okay.

13:56.203 --> 13:58.846
So, um, seriously, dude.

13:59.884 --> 14:01.585
Did you hear anything last night?

14:01.816 --> 14:03.247
Like, anything at all?

14:03.402 --> 14:04.995
Hear what? I'm a deep sleeper.

14:04.995 --> 14:07.016
Of course you are.
I forgot, never mind.

14:07.335 --> 14:09.083
You're a lucky bastard,
that's what you are.

14:09.502 --> 14:11.704
- Okay, sh, sh, sh.
- I didn't say anything.

14:11.704 --> 14:12.792
Good, don't.

14:12.964 --> 14:14.432
Sure, what am I not
saying anything about?

14:15.172 --> 14:17.503
Good morning!

14:17.503 --> 14:18.956
- Good morning.
- Hi.

14:18.956 --> 14:20.306
- Hi.
- Hi, Hank.

14:20.306 --> 14:22.076
- Hey Paige, what's up?
- Shh. Sh.

14:22.076 --> 14:24.864
So how did you sleep?

14:24.864 --> 14:26.540
Really good, really good.

14:26.540 --> 14:27.248
Good.

14:27.536 --> 14:28.353
Coffee?

14:28.353 --> 14:29.427
Oh. No, thank you.

14:29.427 --> 14:30.855
It keeps me up at night.

14:31.133 --> 14:32.103
Me too.

14:41.002 --> 14:43.056
I could stay up here for hours.

14:43.235 --> 14:46.260
It's nice to escape and
leave your problems on land.

14:51.709 --> 14:53.262
How long have you been flying?

14:53.905 --> 14:56.415
Since before I could walk.

14:56.584 --> 14:59.332
My dad was a crop duster in Kansas.

14:59.332 --> 15:01.021
So after being conceived in a plane

15:01.021 --> 15:03.441
I pretty much grew up in one.

15:04.065 --> 15:06.562
I always thought it was amazing
that you could be going

15:06.562 --> 15:09.998
120 miles per hour, and
you look out the window

15:09.998 --> 15:12.059
and it seems like you're barely moving.

15:13.544 --> 15:15.259
It's the only place I can relax.

15:17.420 --> 15:19.128
Harry hated flying.

15:20.646 --> 15:22.388
You two were clearly very close.

15:25.119 --> 15:27.394
Harry was a pain in the
ass, he drove me crazy.

15:28.308 --> 15:29.582
But you would have liked him.

15:31.544 --> 15:32.907
Everybody did.

15:46.916 --> 15:48.026
Jess?

15:48.270 --> 15:49.127
Jess.

15:49.284 --> 15:50.323
Jess, are you okay?

15:50.390 --> 15:51.931
Jess. Jess, can you hear me?

15:52.107 --> 15:53.046
Jess!

15:54.237 --> 15:55.733
- What hap...
- Can you land this plane?

15:55.733 --> 15:57.767
- Of course.
- Okay, then do it.

15:58.157 --> 15:59.247
- I'm...
- Now!

16:07.603 --> 16:08.755
Okay, Jess.

16:08.755 --> 16:12.447
We're gonna do a neurological
exam called a Romberg Test.

16:12.447 --> 16:15.179
Just take a few steps.
First, heel to toe.

16:15.656 --> 16:16.609
That's it.

16:17.548 --> 16:18.552
Perfect.

16:18.733 --> 16:20.519
Keep your fingers spread out wide.

16:20.619 --> 16:23.169
Touch your nose with this finger.

16:23.739 --> 16:25.075
Tap this hand.

16:25.824 --> 16:27.053
Tap this hand.

16:27.395 --> 16:28.471
Play the piano.

16:28.790 --> 16:30.115
Okay, play <i>Für Elise</i>.

16:39.712 --> 16:42.183
She does not have
orthostatic hypertension.

16:42.183 --> 16:44.213
And there is less than
a 20 over 10 point gap

16:44.213 --> 16:46.100
between her three blood
pressure readings.

16:46.676 --> 16:48.529
Well, that rules out dehydration.

16:48.529 --> 16:50.477
It probably also
rules out any reaction

16:50.477 --> 16:53.035
to the blood pressure or
anxiety meds we prescribed.

16:53.035 --> 16:56.142
So I got dazed and sweaty
for a minute, big deal.

16:56.288 --> 16:58.264
I get that way at Viggo
Mortensen movies too.

16:58.777 --> 17:00.717
I know you checked your blood
pressure before the flight,

17:00.717 --> 17:02.108
did you check it when you landed?

17:02.211 --> 17:03.505
Immediately... and it was low.

17:03.505 --> 17:04.837
100 over 60.

17:04.837 --> 17:07.598
- So adjust my meds.
- It's not that simple.

17:07.598 --> 17:10.092
Low blood pressure can
cause a syncopal episode.

17:10.092 --> 17:11.215
A loss of consciousness.

17:11.215 --> 17:13.327
Or you could have some
sort of seizure disorder.

17:13.327 --> 17:15.357
Either way, you're going
to need some tests.

17:15.528 --> 17:18.123
Yeah, in addition to a
head CT, let's to an EEG,

17:18.123 --> 17:21.002
and run some blood tests to rule
out electrolyte abnormalities.

17:21.002 --> 17:22.063
Maybe we should do that today.

17:22.063 --> 17:23.919
Oh, I can't. I'm giving a lesson.

17:23.919 --> 17:26.421
Uh, Jess. I'm afraid due

17:26.421 --> 17:28.141
to what happened, we
have to ground you.

17:28.141 --> 17:29.383
But you don't know what happened.

17:29.383 --> 17:31.542
Yeah, but if you did have
a seizure, you can't fly.

17:31.735 --> 17:33.929
I mean, the FAA could
permanently ground you.

17:34.074 --> 17:35.611
You need to be cleared
by a neurologist.

17:35.735 --> 17:37.185
I'm trying to start a business.

17:37.185 --> 17:38.596
My life out here depends on it.

17:38.596 --> 17:40.347
And your life depends on your health.

17:40.347 --> 17:42.693
So if I can't fly,
what am I going to do?

17:43.297 --> 17:46.234
Go back to my old job and work 24-7

17:46.234 --> 17:48.271
until I collapse on the
pavement like Harry did.

17:48.271 --> 17:50.659
I can't let that happen, Hank.
He'd kill me.

17:50.659 --> 17:52.485
Okay, then let's rule out a seizure.

17:53.207 --> 17:55.200
We can have the results back tomorrow.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.590
Hopefully you can get
back in your plane.

17:58.167 --> 17:59.017
Fine.

18:24.750 --> 18:26.232
Is it tradition for an Indian groom

18:26.232 --> 18:27.913
not to attend his own Sangeet?

18:27.913 --> 18:29.111
No, Raj will be here.

18:29.522 --> 18:31.736
He has to be here... right?

18:31.736 --> 18:33.040
- Hello.
- Hi!

18:33.313 --> 18:35.197
I feel like we're being filmed.

18:35.197 --> 18:36.228
I think so too.

18:36.466 --> 18:37.571
Do you want to send Raj and Divya

18:37.571 --> 18:38.510
any wedding wishes?

18:39.802 --> 18:40.451
Hmm.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.683
- Yes.
- Right this way.

18:42.883 --> 18:43.545
Let's go.

18:44.322 --> 18:45.911
Divya said Raj's flight was delayed.

18:46.217 --> 18:48.079
Interesting. She told me the same.

18:48.298 --> 18:49.560
Ah, I'm sure everything's fine.

18:49.798 --> 18:51.857
People only say that when
things aren't, you know?

18:51.999 --> 18:53.220
I know, but you still have to say it.

18:53.366 --> 18:54.096
Yeah.

18:54.819 --> 18:57.362
Hey, did Divya ever mention a guy...

18:58.801 --> 19:00.293
you know what?
Not important.

19:00.293 --> 19:01.771
- As a matter of...
- A patient, Adam.

19:02.814 --> 19:03.715
You do know.

19:03.715 --> 19:06.008
- I know it's complicated.
- Yes, it is.

19:06.193 --> 19:08.044
- And not really our business.
- No, it isn't.

19:08.044 --> 19:10.077
And we probably shouldn't
be discussing it.

19:10.234 --> 19:11.243
But we are.

19:14.874 --> 19:15.806
It's Raj.

19:16.717 --> 19:17.949
- Hey.
- Hi.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.916
Where are you?
Have you landed?

19:19.916 --> 19:20.707
You want my advice?

19:20.707 --> 19:21.767
I would tell him how angry you are,

19:21.767 --> 19:24.588
how devastated you are,
possibly both... maybe cry.

19:24.588 --> 19:25.727
The point is you have a bargaining chip

19:25.727 --> 19:27.013
that you can use later.

19:27.013 --> 19:29.015
Okay, I don't want your advice.

19:29.160 --> 19:31.027
Well, why'd you let
me go on like that?

19:31.027 --> 19:33.867
I'm so sorry, but you know how
these planes can be sometimes.

19:33.867 --> 19:35.002
Okay, okay. Listen.

19:35.790 --> 19:38.711
Just tell me.
Will there be any more delays?

19:38.799 --> 19:39.309
No.

19:40.808 --> 19:42.055
Well, then where are you?

19:42.397 --> 19:43.601
Turn around.

19:49.234 --> 19:50.431
I am so sorry.

19:50.940 --> 19:51.896
Don't be.

19:55.634 --> 19:56.687
You're here now.

19:58.194 --> 19:59.656
Let's get this Sangeet started.

20:03.323 --> 20:04.913
Thank you all for coming.

20:05.636 --> 20:07.036
It means the world to us.

20:07.192 --> 20:09.576
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

20:25.934 --> 20:27.227
Hey, which one's ours?

20:27.506 --> 20:28.644
I don't know, which one?

20:29.216 --> 20:31.011
Evan, we discussed
the gift this morning.

20:31.011 --> 20:32.283
You said you'd get it.

20:32.839 --> 20:33.839
I did?...

20:34.898 --> 20:36.359
tell me you at least brought a card.

20:36.737 --> 20:37.958
No, I did not.

20:38.169 --> 20:39.718
Okay. Great.

20:40.038 --> 20:41.572
Oh, I need coffee.

20:41.935 --> 20:43.243
Hey, check your right hand.

20:43.968 --> 20:45.810
- Oh, - yep, there it is.

20:50.463 --> 20:51.498
- You first.
- You first.

20:51.498 --> 20:52.056
Oh!

20:55.815 --> 20:56.962
Well, do you like it?

20:58.169 --> 20:59.110
I do.

21:00.500 --> 21:01.822
Open yours.

21:04.109 --> 21:05.243
Do you like it?

21:05.680 --> 21:06.851
It's beautiful.

21:07.253 --> 21:08.739
I'm so relieved.

21:09.041 --> 21:12.129
I was afraid you'd think
it wasn't personal enough.

21:12.589 --> 21:13.784
No.

21:14.880 --> 21:16.386
It is perfect.

21:17.831 --> 21:19.012
And very timely.

21:20.358 --> 21:21.505
Thank you.

21:22.725 --> 21:23.892
Thank you.

21:33.398 --> 21:34.181
Hi.

21:35.322 --> 21:36.478
Music?

21:36.853 --> 21:38.068
Candles?

21:38.570 --> 21:40.146
A humidifier.

21:41.521 --> 21:42.757
That's romantic.

21:43.492 --> 21:44.914
And good for the skin.

21:45.720 --> 21:48.673
Humidifiers also
promote restful sleep.

21:49.034 --> 21:51.423
- Oh.
- But, there's more.

21:53.619 --> 21:55.703
Yay for presents!

21:55.940 --> 21:56.710
What's in here?

21:56.710 --> 21:58.335
- Open it!
- Okay.

21:59.039 --> 22:00.954
Holy...Whoa, you're like a tigress.

22:00.954 --> 22:01.640
Raawr!

22:04.010 --> 22:05.325
La Perla?

22:06.530 --> 22:07.677
Oh!

22:09.431 --> 22:10.746
La Perla.

22:11.789 --> 22:16.006
And... Slazenger.

22:16.429 --> 22:17.128
What?

22:17.300 --> 22:21.325
What did you do to this
beautiful piece of lingerie?

22:21.325 --> 22:22.917
Well, sleeping on your back,

22:22.917 --> 22:25.117
it makes snoring worse, I read.

22:25.117 --> 22:26.922
So the tennis ball just prevents it.

22:28.920 --> 22:30.292
Oh, no, you hate it.

22:30.996 --> 22:33.670
That you ruined Italian lingerie?

22:34.532 --> 22:35.632
Yeah.

22:37.574 --> 22:41.677
That you sewed for me? No.

22:45.318 --> 22:47.315
Just come over right now.
Now, now, now, now!

22:47.864 --> 22:49.157
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.

22:49.322 --> 22:51.182
Calm down, what's going on?

22:51.334 --> 22:52.489
We've got a medical emergency.

22:52.489 --> 22:53.687
Why didn't you say
that when you called?

22:53.687 --> 22:54.138
What's going on?

22:54.139 --> 22:56.230
You wouldn't have been
able to hear me...

22:57.687 --> 22:58.937
- Wow.
- Yeah.

22:58.937 --> 23:01.123
- Dude, that is...
- Like a band of gorillas

23:01.123 --> 23:02.502
attempting to crank up a model T?

23:02.502 --> 23:03.547
- Yeah!
- I know, it is!

23:03.547 --> 23:04.921
I know, I know.
Which is why I need your help.

23:04.921 --> 23:07.063
You're not staying with me.
You're not.

23:07.796 --> 23:09.643
- You think this is funny?
- A little, yeah.

23:09.643 --> 23:12.244
Dude, I haven't slept
in two days, two days.

23:12.244 --> 23:15.065
She sounds like a Tauntaun
...from "Empire Strikes Back",

23:15.065 --> 23:15.896
you know...

23:16.756 --> 23:18.519
With the snoring problem, like...

23:20.670 --> 23:22.271
And it's Paige we're
talking about, you know?

23:22.271 --> 23:24.683
It's adorable, sweet,
amazing, funny Paige

23:24.683 --> 23:25.729
who makes me feel like...

23:26.615 --> 23:28.845
she makes me feel like nothing
I've ever felt before.

23:29.670 --> 23:31.139
I've never seen you like this.

23:31.319 --> 23:33.419
I know, I know.
I've never been like this.

23:33.419 --> 23:35.625
- I'm exhausted and spent...
- No.

23:35.625 --> 23:38.363
And I'm seeing things.
Like, look at me, I'm a wreck.

23:38.536 --> 23:39.915
I can't spend my whole life like this.

23:39.915 --> 23:41.213
- Your whole life?
- Yeah!

23:41.213 --> 23:43.648
Your whole life? Evan, wow!

23:43.831 --> 23:46.109
I mean, you really... you
really care about this girl.

23:46.639 --> 23:47.602
I...

23:48.237 --> 23:49.593
What? That's not what
we're talking about.

23:49.593 --> 23:50.706
Look, look, look.

23:51.067 --> 23:52.868
- We have a medical...
- Emergency.

23:52.868 --> 23:54.111
I know that's what you think.

23:54.111 --> 23:55.447
- So have you told her?
- I...

23:57.073 --> 23:58.739
Stop... look, stop it. Stop.

23:58.739 --> 24:00.145
I'm fine. Never mind.

24:00.145 --> 24:00.909
Okay?

24:11.434 --> 24:12.454
Come on.

24:20.292 --> 24:21.461
Thank you for meeting me.

24:23.054 --> 24:24.771
Well, Hank.
What is so important?

24:26.000 --> 24:27.059
Marisa.

24:32.524 --> 24:34.975
Look, I know there's a lot
going on with this for you.

24:35.573 --> 24:38.718
But I just think it's important
that you see the big picture.

24:40.924 --> 24:42.750
Those children, Hank.
Do you see them?

24:43.183 --> 24:44.051
Yeah.

24:44.279 --> 24:48.850
They are happy.
Completely without guile.

24:50.822 --> 24:53.693
Now, imagine them having
to watch their father

24:54.048 --> 24:55.466
wither away and die.

24:56.393 --> 24:59.151
Only to then realize that the same fate

25:00.979 --> 25:02.478
will be their own.

25:04.232 --> 25:06.786
That is my big picture, Hank.

25:07.599 --> 25:10.384
Boris, there's a chance
that a cure will be found.

25:11.343 --> 25:13.779
And if not for you,
then for your child.

25:14.325 --> 25:15.932
I mean, that's the picture
you should be looking...

25:16.098 --> 25:17.638
you don't understand.

25:17.841 --> 25:19.386
You don't understand anything, Hank.

25:19.494 --> 25:21.696
I understand there's
a woman who needs you.

25:22.467 --> 25:25.961
And a baby...
who's gonna need a father.

25:26.065 --> 25:27.120
You're not listening.

25:27.931 --> 25:30.047
I promised myself that this disease...

25:31.816 --> 25:33.607
Would die with me.

25:36.699 --> 25:39.097
Sometimes promises
have to be broken.

26:46.718 --> 26:47.675
Jess.

26:47.857 --> 26:49.666
Jess, are you having chest pains?

26:49.666 --> 26:52.191
Hank, I can't breathe.

26:52.191 --> 26:54.263
I can't catch my breath.

26:54.263 --> 26:55.678
Okay, just try to relax.

26:55.678 --> 26:57.125
Just try to relax.

26:57.333 --> 26:59.501
Everything's closing in.

26:59.501 --> 27:02.646
There are just so many people.

27:02.900 --> 27:04.778
I think you're having
an anxiety attack.

27:04.942 --> 27:06.605
That's what's going on. Okay?

27:06.751 --> 27:08.014
So we just have to calm down.

27:08.183 --> 27:09.486
Don't make me go to the hospital.

27:10.875 --> 27:14.592
I'm not gonna go there.
That's where Harry went.

27:14.792 --> 27:17.701
I am not taking you
to the hospital, okay?

27:17.828 --> 27:19.326
But I am gonna get you out of here.

27:19.976 --> 27:21.601
Now just first look at me.

27:22.161 --> 27:23.404
Jess, look at me.

27:24.064 --> 27:26.097
Take slow, even breaths.

27:27.267 --> 27:28.255
That's it.

27:28.487 --> 27:29.656
That's it. I am here with you.

27:29.738 --> 27:30.750
I am right here.

27:36.539 --> 27:37.725
You're okay.

27:38.409 --> 27:40.129
Jess, you're okay.

27:51.106 --> 27:52.615
I'm okay.

27:54.308 --> 27:55.065
Now?

27:55.370 --> 27:56.293
Um, hi.

27:56.293 --> 27:58.140
- To Divya...
- And Raj.

27:58.388 --> 28:01.522
This is the best Sangeet
I have ever been to.

28:01.522 --> 28:02.539
This is the only Sangeet

28:02.539 --> 28:03.781
either of us have ever been to.

28:03.781 --> 28:05.274
- Okay, but it's still the best.
- It's still the best.

28:05.274 --> 28:06.354
It's amazing, and thank you

28:06.354 --> 28:08.263
very much for inviting both of us.

28:08.263 --> 28:09.137
And...

28:09.137 --> 28:09.989
One, two, three.

28:09.989 --> 28:12.039
Shaadi Mubarak!

28:12.039 --> 28:12.807
Mubarak.

28:12.992 --> 28:15.505
Which hopefully means,
"have a great wedding."

28:15.505 --> 28:17.291
Or, we just said
something really offensive

28:17.291 --> 28:18.977
and we apologize, but either way...

28:19.870 --> 28:20.956
We love you.

28:21.192 --> 28:22.049
How was that?

28:22.049 --> 28:23.489
How long have they been a couple?

28:24.158 --> 28:25.739
Well, not long at all.

28:32.943 --> 28:34.118
Everything okay?

28:37.268 --> 28:39.810
Looks like I'll be going
back to London tomorrow.

28:40.650 --> 28:42.013
Well, you just got here.

28:43.696 --> 28:44.779
Divya...

28:45.875 --> 28:47.211
There's something I haven't been

28:47.474 --> 28:49.163
completely up front about.

28:50.255 --> 28:51.450
There is?

28:52.218 --> 28:53.815
Katdare Properties.

28:54.514 --> 28:56.289
The economy has taken its toll,

28:56.714 --> 28:59.419
revenue has dropped significantly.

28:59.934 --> 29:01.634
Your father needs this wedding

29:01.634 --> 29:04.426
to show the world that all is well.

29:06.073 --> 29:07.983
That's why the guest list just shot up.

29:09.474 --> 29:12.265
And why we need to have an
elephant at the wedding.

29:19.830 --> 29:21.064
Go to London.

29:22.369 --> 29:25.224
I'll cancel the dance lessons
and the flying lessons.

29:25.993 --> 29:27.103
It will be fine.

29:30.843 --> 29:32.073
No.

29:33.430 --> 29:37.409
I'll explain to your father
that I must stay here.

29:38.660 --> 29:40.649
Work will go up and down,

29:41.120 --> 29:43.703
but you will only be married once.

29:55.116 --> 29:56.095
So?

29:56.843 --> 29:57.737
Yes.

29:57.966 --> 30:03.235
So they say that the most
complicated problems

30:03.417 --> 30:06.459
often have the simplest of answers.

30:06.588 --> 30:07.514
Who says that?

30:07.701 --> 30:09.035
Uh, the instruction booklet.

30:09.371 --> 30:10.266
So...

30:10.529 --> 30:11.694
And... Ta-da!

30:11.907 --> 30:13.750
That does not look simple.

30:13.750 --> 30:16.101
Well, it's not the most
graceful of instruments really.

30:16.101 --> 30:17.457
But the success ratio,

30:17.457 --> 30:18.767
it's much higher than you'd expect.

30:18.829 --> 30:19.846
I expect nothing.

30:19.846 --> 30:20.437
See?

30:22.833 --> 30:24.827
So, yeah. You just, you just, uh...

30:24.827 --> 30:26.697
I'm supposed to wear that?

30:26.697 --> 30:29.447
Yeah, you just... look,
it's so comfortable.

30:29.447 --> 30:31.531
Put it on, this holds it in place.

30:33.582 --> 30:34.325
No snoring.

30:34.325 --> 30:35.761
You just wear it at night, right?

30:36.871 --> 30:39.659
So yeah, just give it a...

30:40.657 --> 30:42.988
this is really humiliating.

30:43.157 --> 30:45.381
Paige. No, no, no.

30:46.441 --> 30:47.334
Look...

30:49.970 --> 30:52.069
Everyone has their weak spot, you know?

30:52.069 --> 30:54.531
Everyone has something
that haunts them.

30:55.445 --> 30:58.066
Like Superman, he's got kryptonite.

30:58.617 --> 31:00.306
And I hate giant spiders.

31:00.488 --> 31:01.456
Hate them.

31:01.741 --> 31:02.755
And you?

31:03.361 --> 31:04.374
You snore.

31:05.003 --> 31:07.120
Like a demon.

31:10.854 --> 31:13.067
Maybe I should look into surgery.

31:14.605 --> 31:16.700
I know a great doctor.

31:19.524 --> 31:21.653
So I called and Jess
should be waiting for us.

31:21.852 --> 31:24.164
- I added a fraction
plasma-free metanephrine level

31:24.356 --> 31:25.606
on the labs we ordered for her,

31:25.606 --> 31:27.625
and the numbers were
moderately elevated.

31:27.975 --> 31:30.301
Jess' continuous BP monitor results

31:30.301 --> 31:32.181
showed a pattern of spikes
in her blood pressure.

31:32.555 --> 31:34.349
That combined with her
chronic hypertension,

31:34.349 --> 31:36.479
palpitations, anxiety, syncope...

31:36.479 --> 31:37.482
okay, so what are you thinking?

31:37.618 --> 31:40.493
It could be a pheo on her
adrenal gland causing a leak.

31:42.621 --> 31:44.769
So then Jess isn't just
an adrenaline junkie.

31:44.933 --> 31:46.693
She's literally
drowning in adrenaline.

31:47.771 --> 31:48.625
Jess?

31:50.571 --> 31:51.491
Jess?

31:51.689 --> 31:52.973
Jess, where are you going?

31:53.111 --> 31:54.783
Where do you think? New York.

31:54.783 --> 31:56.191
I have to hurry, he's waiting for me.

31:56.191 --> 31:58.283
- Who's waiting for you?
- Harry.

31:59.016 --> 31:59.863
Wait, who are you?

31:59.863 --> 32:01.317
I'm sorry, you're not
getting on that plane.

32:01.317 --> 32:02.537
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

32:02.537 --> 32:03.855
- You can't.
- Yes.

32:03.855 --> 32:05.498
No, I'm sorry. Come here.

32:05.903 --> 32:08.310
Just relax. Just relax, it's okay.

32:08.310 --> 32:10.614
It's okay, you're fine. You're fine.

32:10.614 --> 32:12.261
- Is she tachycardic?
- Yeah, her heart's racing.

32:12.261 --> 32:14.735
Hand me the nitroglycerin
paste and call 911.

32:15.217 --> 32:16.257
Okay. It's okay, Jess.

32:16.257 --> 32:17.130
It's okay.

32:18.378 --> 32:19.188
It's all right. Just breathe.

32:19.188 --> 32:19.995
Just relax.

32:21.283 --> 32:22.508
That's it. That's it.

32:23.253 --> 32:24.192
Shh.

32:25.086 --> 32:26.578
That should calm you down.

32:27.403 --> 32:29.301
Okay. Hey, it's okay.

32:31.251 --> 32:33.402
35-year-old female in
hypertensive crisis.

32:33.402 --> 32:36.204
Bp is 260 over 140,
she's encephalopathic.

32:36.204 --> 32:38.245
Any clue as to why she would
be in a hypertensive crisis?

32:38.245 --> 32:39.779
Well, she was thought to
be manifesting symptoms

32:39.779 --> 32:41.177
of anxiety syndrome and at the time

32:41.177 --> 32:43.133
was noted to have
underlying hypertension.

32:43.297 --> 32:44.664
She's had intermittent complaints of

32:44.664 --> 32:47.167
cephalgia, palpitations
and diaphoresis.

32:47.167 --> 32:48.056
Let's get her in the bed.

32:48.529 --> 32:50.235
One, two, three.

32:52.161 --> 32:53.017
Good.

32:57.990 --> 32:59.482
- Hank.
- Yeah.

32:59.661 --> 33:00.808
What's happening to me?

33:00.998 --> 33:02.225
Well, I think the reason

33:02.225 --> 33:04.359
for the anxiety and the hypertension

33:04.359 --> 33:07.201
is that your body is producing
too much adrenaline.

33:07.576 --> 33:09.373
It's called Pheochromocytoma.

33:09.826 --> 33:13.765
A pheo is a mass of chromaffin
cells in the adrenal gland.

33:13.765 --> 33:15.270
And you've probably had it for months.

33:15.741 --> 33:18.245
Jess, I think the life you were leading

33:18.245 --> 33:19.947
mirrored the starting
symptoms of the pheo,

33:19.947 --> 33:21.400
and then the pheo got worse.

33:21.983 --> 33:23.616
But to treat it we have to prove it.

33:23.933 --> 33:25.733
Can you set up an MRI of her abdomen

33:25.733 --> 33:27.600
as soon as you can get her
blood pressure under control?

33:27.797 --> 33:29.714
Ms. Casey, we need
priority on the MRI.

33:29.869 --> 33:30.777
I'll call Radiology

33:30.777 --> 33:32.025
and make sure there's a table waiting.

33:32.025 --> 33:33.879
I'll start the phentolamine
drip to stabilize her.

33:33.879 --> 33:36.011
- Great.
- Will I be all right?

33:36.011 --> 33:38.168
You'll be fine, Jess.
And if it's all right

33:38.168 --> 33:39.982
with the E.R.,
I'll stay with you all the way.

33:40.196 --> 33:40.999
Of course.

33:41.150 --> 33:42.076
Thank you.

33:42.618 --> 33:43.693
You're gonna be fine.

33:44.140 --> 33:44.906
Okay?

33:47.365 --> 33:48.353
Okay, open?

33:49.380 --> 33:50.602
And say, "Aah."

33:50.749 --> 33:51.607
Aah.

33:53.835 --> 33:54.740
Well?

33:55.374 --> 33:57.158
A little hard to tell
with you on top of me.

33:57.158 --> 33:57.869
Okay.

33:59.102 --> 34:00.222
Again?

34:01.028 --> 34:03.815
So, diagnosis? Um... anything?

34:03.815 --> 34:05.127
What are you seeing there, Henry?

34:05.127 --> 34:08.467
Well, what I don't see are
inflamed tonsils or polyps.

34:08.467 --> 34:10.061
That's good, right?
That's great, that's good.

34:10.061 --> 34:11.853
- How are her adenoids.
- Hm?

34:12.800 --> 34:14.487
I've been doing a lot
of late night reading.

34:14.487 --> 34:15.815
- Late night reading.
- Okay.

34:15.815 --> 34:17.101
Can you help me, Hank?

34:17.101 --> 34:18.632
Paige, you're fine.

34:18.632 --> 34:20.371
But your uvula's a little long.

34:20.371 --> 34:21.797
So I can refer you to an E.N.T.

34:21.797 --> 34:23.101
For a more thorough examination,

34:23.101 --> 34:25.206
but my guess is that
your uvula is vibrating,

34:25.206 --> 34:27.058
- causing you to snore.
- Oh.

34:27.221 --> 34:28.132
Um...

34:31.167 --> 34:32.626
- Come here for a second.
- Oh, okay.

34:34.007 --> 34:34.969
Um...

34:36.558 --> 34:38.549
How can you see her
uvula from there?

34:39.159 --> 34:40.626
- From...
- what's a uvula?

34:40.768 --> 34:42.893
It's the conic projection
coming off the posterior...

34:43.152 --> 34:45.119
it's the thing that hangs down
in the back of the throat.

34:45.119 --> 34:46.723
- It goes blrrgh...
- Oh, my God!

34:46.723 --> 34:48.243
- The uvula!
- The uvula, okay.

34:48.243 --> 34:49.458
- Okay, great.
- Yeah, okay.

34:51.585 --> 34:52.400
Uh... hey, buddy.

34:52.400 --> 34:53.744
You might want to lay off the sugar.

34:53.744 --> 34:55.565
You're a little jumpy.

34:55.565 --> 34:57.315
Uh, no I'm not. I'm not jumpy.

34:57.315 --> 34:59.360
I've been... do I seem jumpy?

34:59.360 --> 35:00.679
A touch, a touch.

35:00.679 --> 35:02.229
Ice cream is our nightly ritual.

35:02.229 --> 35:02.984
Oh, that's nice.

35:02.984 --> 35:05.631
Yeah, every night. It relaxes us.

35:05.631 --> 35:07.588
Clearly. You seem really relaxed.

35:07.588 --> 35:08.276
Do you want a bowl?

35:09.021 --> 35:10.112
No, thank you.

35:10.112 --> 35:13.783
But, um, it could be that...
I mean, just so you know.

35:13.783 --> 35:16.185
Dairy products can make snoring louder.

35:19.315 --> 35:20.635
But I'll make an appointment for you

35:20.635 --> 35:22.052
with an ear, nose, and
throat specialist.

35:22.052 --> 35:25.085
- Just in case, okay?
- Great, great.

35:35.863 --> 35:37.197
Is it a problem someone else

35:37.197 --> 35:38.447
will be piloting the plane?

35:39.507 --> 35:41.129
I'll try not to be a backseat pilot,

35:41.129 --> 35:42.658
but I'm not making any promises.

35:42.658 --> 35:43.087
Okay.

35:43.318 --> 35:46.753
And he's a friend doing a
favor, so I have to behave.

35:46.926 --> 35:49.121
And he's kinda cute.

35:49.484 --> 35:50.513
Kinda?

35:50.728 --> 35:52.880
Yes, and that's all I'm saying.

35:53.125 --> 35:54.056
Okay.

35:54.668 --> 35:55.713
Thank you...

35:56.144 --> 35:58.220
For helping me find a specialist, Hank.

35:58.417 --> 36:00.531
Oh, yeah, Dr. Schwartz is
an excellent surgeon.

36:00.531 --> 36:01.657
He'll remove the pheo,

36:01.657 --> 36:03.592
and then your blood pressure
should come back to normal.

36:04.027 --> 36:05.722
And don't worry,
you should be able

36:05.722 --> 36:07.263
to resume flying in about six weeks.

36:07.263 --> 36:08.709
Yeah, if I have any customers.

36:09.460 --> 36:10.718
You're looking at one.

36:11.723 --> 36:13.356
What about your fear of crashing?

36:13.778 --> 36:15.209
Having someone I trust
behind the wheel

36:15.209 --> 36:16.482
makes all the difference.

36:17.264 --> 36:18.959
- Thanks, Hank.
- Well, let's wait until

36:19.111 --> 36:20.561
I actually get in the
plane to thank me.

36:21.325 --> 36:22.664
No, really.

36:22.664 --> 36:24.234
I look at you, you were like me.

36:24.234 --> 36:26.999
- A New York adrenaline junkie.
- Mm-hmm.

36:26.999 --> 36:28.509
But you escaped.

36:28.666 --> 36:30.408
New career. New life.

36:30.759 --> 36:31.963
And it seems like you're really happy

36:31.963 --> 36:33.929
with where you are, who you are.

36:34.235 --> 36:35.555
I guess I'm jealous.

36:36.593 --> 36:39.812
You know, last winter, when
I told you Harry died...

36:40.753 --> 36:42.607
That was the third time that shift

36:42.607 --> 36:43.985
that I'd given that speech.

36:44.991 --> 36:47.068
I was just... I don't know.
I was fried.

36:47.906 --> 36:49.775
I remember watching you
walk away and thinking,

36:50.716 --> 36:52.240
"Oh, okay...

36:52.240 --> 36:54.962
"maybe this is what
they mean by E.R. burnout."

36:57.449 --> 36:59.182
You made me feel better.

37:00.314 --> 37:01.343
I didn't know it at the time,

37:01.343 --> 37:04.603
but I needed to change my life.

37:05.119 --> 37:07.433
We both got wake-up calls that night.

37:07.433 --> 37:09.061
But you listened to yours.

37:09.752 --> 37:11.598
So you've got nothing
to be jealous about.

37:11.598 --> 37:12.716
You're doing it.

37:13.276 --> 37:14.417
You did it.

37:14.726 --> 37:15.890
Know that.

37:17.768 --> 37:19.114
For the record...

37:19.828 --> 37:20.953
If I were piloting,

37:20.953 --> 37:22.404
that plane wouldn't have been late.

37:23.489 --> 37:24.464
I'm sure.

38:14.132 --> 38:15.441
You're not asleep.

38:17.214 --> 38:18.432
No, I'm not.

38:20.774 --> 38:22.074
Still keeping you up?

38:22.211 --> 38:23.247
No, no.

38:24.368 --> 38:25.255
It's not you.

38:25.456 --> 38:27.922
It's all the caffeine I mainlined.

38:28.529 --> 38:30.516
If you cut me I'd bleed french roast.

38:31.227 --> 38:33.857
So it wasn't my snoring?

38:34.240 --> 38:35.378
You still snore.

38:36.707 --> 38:40.420
But it's like a soft snore now.

38:40.583 --> 38:41.365
It's a good snore.

38:41.529 --> 38:42.583
- Mm-hmm.
- It is.

38:42.583 --> 38:44.147
You sound like a little kitten purring.

38:44.147 --> 38:45.867
It's adorable, actually.

38:46.605 --> 38:47.607
Adorable?

38:48.744 --> 38:50.217
Yeah, you're crazy.

38:51.856 --> 38:54.096
I don't know if it's the coffee

38:54.531 --> 38:56.398
that's pulsing through
my veins or what,

38:56.398 --> 38:57.648
but I can't stop thinking...

38:59.074 --> 39:00.739
can't stop thinking about you.

39:02.527 --> 39:05.720
Um, first we couldn't
spend the night together,

39:05.937 --> 39:08.332
then we could and it was loud.

39:08.585 --> 39:10.904
But still, it was really great.

39:12.994 --> 39:14.865
And now it's just perfect.

39:16.736 --> 39:18.227
You're perfect.

39:19.482 --> 39:20.423
Not literally perfect.

39:20.797 --> 39:24.844
You know, your
imperfections are so cute.

39:25.613 --> 39:30.744
They make you perfect.

39:35.605 --> 39:36.737
Paige.

39:38.438 --> 39:39.881
Evan?

39:46.050 --> 39:46.959
I...

39:49.572 --> 39:51.090
I love you.

39:53.929 --> 39:55.157
Big time.

39:58.756 --> 40:00.532
I love you too.

40:03.961 --> 40:05.451
Oh, thank God.

40:18.258 --> 40:19.396
Let me handle the seating.

40:19.608 --> 40:21.160
You don't even know who's coming.

40:21.334 --> 40:23.140
I'm sure your mother will educate me.

40:23.549 --> 40:26.137
And it's one less thing
you'll have to do.

40:27.512 --> 40:29.440
You know, I think that it
is time we talked about

40:29.440 --> 40:30.769
the elephant in the room.

40:32.583 --> 40:34.980
The actual elephant, Raj.

40:35.558 --> 40:36.953
I don't want it.

40:37.522 --> 40:38.730
Your father insisted.

40:38.887 --> 40:40.412
I know, but it's our wedding.

40:41.279 --> 40:42.663
Look, why don't we tell him together?

40:44.065 --> 40:45.142
I'll talk to him.

40:45.287 --> 40:46.280
He owes me one.

40:46.539 --> 40:47.961
- He does?
- Mm-hmm.

40:48.704 --> 40:49.739
Why?

40:51.486 --> 40:53.411
He needs me to return to work

40:53.599 --> 40:55.787
immediately following our wedding.

40:56.395 --> 40:58.261
You mean after our honeymoon.

41:00.818 --> 41:02.580
What, we're going to
postpone our honeymoon?

41:02.906 --> 41:04.341
Only until things improve.

41:04.506 --> 41:05.727
This Spring, next Summer.

41:05.727 --> 41:06.659
Next Summer?

41:07.712 --> 41:11.865
Raj, what if I want to come
back here next Summer?

41:12.049 --> 41:14.325
Then Autumn, a honeymoon in Autumn.

41:14.325 --> 41:17.112
You want us to honeymoon
after our first anniversary.

41:18.506 --> 41:20.739
We talked about how
crazy this time is.

41:20.739 --> 41:21.759
Yeah, we did.

41:22.086 --> 41:25.005
But who's to say next Autumn
will be any less crazy?

41:25.005 --> 41:26.461
I'm sorry Divya, but we can't keep...

41:26.461 --> 41:27.490
You know what?

41:27.890 --> 41:31.217
Maybe after the wedding I
shouldn't stay in London.

41:31.217 --> 41:33.583
Or, maybe... maybe I should
just come back here.

41:33.583 --> 41:35.045
Because, you know what?
Who knows?

41:35.045 --> 41:37.416
You know what, maybe I could
kiss another patient.

41:38.186 --> 41:39.228
Divya?

41:47.312 --> 41:48.956
I'm sorry, what did you say?

42:00.690 --> 42:03.625
This is... this is the
greatest wedding gift ever.

42:03.625 --> 42:04.953
- Ever!
- They're gonna love it.

42:04.953 --> 42:06.801
But let's not pat ourselves
on the back too much.

42:06.801 --> 42:08.288
In this case that's not even possible.

42:08.288 --> 42:10.302
Look at this, dude.
It's the best ever.

42:10.302 --> 42:12.218
- All time!
- You want some help with that?

42:12.218 --> 42:14.025
- No... Yes.
- Okay.

42:18.357 --> 42:20.281
- Oh, my God.
- It's awesome.

42:22.794 --> 42:23.948
What's happening?

42:23.948 --> 42:25.635
Is Boris giving Dieter the boot?

42:26.618 --> 42:28.102
If he is, we should hire him.

42:28.571 --> 42:30.417
I've always wanted my own manservant.

42:31.124 --> 42:33.424
No, I think it may
be Marisa who's going.

42:33.736 --> 42:34.556
What?

42:34.729 --> 42:35.820
He's kicking her out?

42:36.280 --> 42:37.424
Why?

42:38.408 --> 42:41.027
Uh, she may be leaving
for her own reasons.

42:41.224 --> 42:42.700
Why would she leave all this?

42:42.864 --> 42:43.729
Okay, let's go.

42:43.864 --> 42:46.265
- No, no, no. Why?
- Just go.

42:46.265 --> 42:47.875
- Oh, you can't tell me, right?
- Right.

42:47.875 --> 42:48.969
- It's a doctor-patient,
blah, blah, blah.

42:48.969 --> 42:50.297
Blah, blah, blah. Exactly.

42:50.297 --> 42:52.383
I never get to know
the good stuff... ever.

42:52.733 --> 42:54.041
- Hop on.
- No.

42:54.293 --> 42:55.861
- For two seconds.
- Not a chance.

42:55.861 --> 42:57.180
- Come on!
- No.

42:57.444 --> 42:59.007
What if I let you ride in front?

42:59.221 --> 43:00.703
- Will you be in back?
- Yes.

43:00.703 --> 43:02.493
- Then, no.
- Dude, it's a tandem bike.

43:02.493 --> 43:03.487
- I don't care.
- What...

43:04.872 --> 43:05.946
what the...?

43:06.152 --> 43:07.211
What?

43:10.733 --> 43:12.752
Marisa's not moving out, huh.

43:13.029 --> 43:13.717
No.

43:14.644 --> 43:16.269
Looks like we are.
