Mom, where is this?

17:11.030 --> 17:12.031
Where am I?

17:12.198 --> 17:13.199
Shh, you stay down.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.413
Don't worry.

17:16.577 --> 17:17.669
Hold him down.

17:19.829 --> 17:21.423
Liam, this isn't
going to hurt.

17:23.792 --> 17:25.261
It's gonna be all right.

17:34.595 --> 17:35.687
Move out of the way, please.

17:55.199 --> 17:56.291
(door thuds closed)

18:00.329 --> 18:02.673
(machine whirring and beeping)

18:12.216 --> 18:13.012
(shattering)

18:36.574 --> 18:37.746
Natalie?

18:37.908 --> 18:39.831
It's me!

18:39.994 --> 18:42.042
It's Ingrid!

18:46.959 --> 18:49.303
(wind whistling)

19:14.987 --> 19:17.331
♪♪

19:34.840 --> 19:36.763
Dan, Natalie isn't home.

19:36.926 --> 19:38.678
Her snowmobile is gone,

19:38.844 --> 19:41.893
and it looks like she's
packed clothes for a trip.

19:42.056 --> 19:43.683
She might have done a runner.

19:50.439 --> 19:52.316
Groups of four!

19:52.483 --> 19:54.702
Line up and listen
to Chief Anderssen.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.077
Fast as we can now!

19:56.237 --> 19:57.329
Come on, fast as we can!

19:57.488 --> 20:00.241
Can we handle this?

20:00.408 --> 20:02.502
Or you?

20:06.455 --> 20:09.834
Do we have the resources,
or should I request assistance

20:10.000 --> 20:11.752
from the mainland?

20:11.919 --> 20:14.013
I can handle this.

20:14.171 --> 20:16.549
You were drinking.

20:18.175 --> 20:20.394
Hildur, I was off duty.

20:29.770 --> 20:31.772
If the murder team come over
from the mainland,

20:31.939 --> 20:33.782
they'll be looking at you,
Hildur, won't they?

20:33.941 --> 20:36.410
Charlie wouldn't give you
the glacier.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.504
DAN:
Our missing girl's name

20:47.663 --> 20:50.257
is Natalie Yelburton.

20:50.416 --> 20:52.965
29 years old.

20:53.127 --> 20:55.425
You all have her picture.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.386
Many of you know her.

20:57.548 --> 21:00.722
Friends of hers.

21:00.885 --> 21:05.516
Before you leave here,
you must understand this:

21:05.681 --> 21:08.150
Natalie Yelburton
could be a victim--

21:08.309 --> 21:12.109
missing, lost, abducted.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.865
You have to ask yourself
the question:

21:15.024 --> 21:17.777
if she is worth the risk
to each one of you

21:17.943 --> 21:19.195
that this search entails.

21:19.361 --> 21:24.743
Myself, my team,
we have a job to do.

21:24.909 --> 21:27.628
We signed up for this.

21:27.787 --> 21:31.883
All of you,
look out for one another.

21:32.041 --> 21:33.213
Okay, let's go!

21:33.375 --> 21:34.752
Come on!

21:34.919 --> 21:35.761
Let's go!

21:35.920 --> 21:37.547
Move it out!

21:59.235 --> 22:01.078
Hello?

22:01.237 --> 22:02.830
Anybody?

22:15.960 --> 22:20.215
I'm looking for Chief
Superintendent Dan Anderssen!

22:28.764 --> 22:31.017
I have brought back
your fucking rifle!

22:36.564 --> 22:38.532
Hello!

22:44.113 --> 22:46.912
Dan Anderssen!

22:53.914 --> 22:55.666
(pressing keyboard keys)

23:24.528 --> 23:27.031
Motherfucker.

23:27.197 --> 23:28.449
(machine beeping and whirring)

23:28.616 --> 23:30.163
JULES:
<i>I just thought you should know</i>

23:30.326 --> 23:33.079
<i>they've got a treatment
for frostbite</i>

23:33.245 --> 23:35.998
at the research center,
and I've brought Liam here.

23:39.793 --> 23:41.386
I just thought you should know.

23:44.798 --> 23:46.471
(distant moaning)

23:53.349 --> 23:55.067
Hello?

24:05.736 --> 24:06.828
Hello?

24:13.744 --> 24:16.372
(moaning)

24:21.627 --> 24:22.753
Hello, is everything okay?

24:34.723 --> 24:37.351
(faint beeping)

24:55.077 --> 24:55.828
(gasps)

24:55.995 --> 24:59.716
(snorting and groaning)

25:10.884 --> 25:13.012
WOMAN:
<i>Traditionally, they used wee.</i>

25:13.178 --> 25:15.397
Old lady's urine.

25:15.556 --> 25:17.900
Oh, God, you've got
to be kidding me.

25:18.058 --> 25:21.153
But nowadays,
it's fermented in ammonia.

25:21.311 --> 25:23.154
Well, that's progress.

25:23.313 --> 25:25.190
You have to wash the fish
thoroughly in fresh water

25:25.357 --> 25:26.529
before you cook it,

25:26.692 --> 25:28.615
or you could burn
your esophagus.

25:28.777 --> 25:30.495
I bet.

25:30.654 --> 25:32.907
So do you cook this, um...

25:33.073 --> 25:37.249
Lutefiske.

25:37.411 --> 25:38.333
For your husband?

25:40.706 --> 25:41.798
Once.

25:43.792 --> 25:45.294
He wouldn't eat it.

25:55.179 --> 25:56.931
So what do you do?

25:57.097 --> 25:58.644
Wait, let me guess.

26:02.478 --> 26:04.151
Travel industry?

26:04.313 --> 26:05.485
You know, the one thing

26:05.647 --> 26:07.149
that I don't understand
about Fortitude

26:07.316 --> 26:12.743
is how the people there
endure the dark months.

26:12.905 --> 26:16.330
I mean, the isolation,
the cold,

26:16.492 --> 26:20.463
the desolation,
the loneliness.

26:20.621 --> 26:22.840
Oh, it's never lonely.

26:22.998 --> 26:24.625
No?

26:24.792 --> 26:26.669
Well, the people
who live there,

26:26.835 --> 26:31.215
most of them share
an understanding.

26:31.381 --> 26:33.304
What about?

26:35.677 --> 26:37.975
You look out
for the wind chimes.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.272
Okey-dokey.

26:45.354 --> 26:47.982
VINCENT:
<i>Am I going to have a lawyer?</i>

26:48.148 --> 26:50.071
You haven't been charged,
only arrested,

26:50.234 --> 26:52.407
so you're not entitled
to a lawyer

26:52.569 --> 26:54.287
unless or until
you are charged.

26:54.446 --> 26:57.199
What if I need legal help?

26:57.366 --> 26:59.414
I can give you any legal advice
you might require.

26:59.576 --> 27:01.169
I thought you said
you were the governor.

27:01.328 --> 27:02.329
I'm also
a trained lawyer,

27:02.496 --> 27:04.965
and the chief of police
on Fortitude.

27:09.294 --> 27:11.262
You two have it all sewn up.

27:11.421 --> 27:14.391
(camera whirring)

27:23.267 --> 27:24.564
Sound?

27:26.645 --> 27:28.488
You need to record
all of this.

27:28.647 --> 27:29.739
I know!

27:29.898 --> 27:31.366
Is it recording?

27:33.193 --> 27:34.536
I think it's recording.

27:34.695 --> 27:37.915
So why can't we hear
what they're saying?

27:38.073 --> 27:39.996
I don't know, I'm not
a fucking computer expert.

27:42.536 --> 27:45.836
HILDUR: <i>Is that how you got
that head wound there?</i>

27:45.998 --> 27:47.341
Okay.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.376
So is it recording?

27:49.543 --> 27:50.840
VINCENT:
<i>I slipped...</i>

27:51.003 --> 27:52.596
(audio cuts out)

27:52.754 --> 27:55.348
Now we can't hear
what they're saying again.

27:55.507 --> 27:57.259
Ingrid, this is
crucial evidence.

27:57.426 --> 27:58.348
It better be recording.

27:58.510 --> 27:59.511
Where's the manual?

27:59.678 --> 28:00.725
It is recording.

28:02.055 --> 28:03.557
I don't know.

28:03.724 --> 28:06.193
I think it might
still be recording,

28:06.351 --> 28:07.898
we just can't hear it
out of these stupid speakers.

28:08.061 --> 28:09.654
I hope so.

28:10.898 --> 28:14.778
Red light, red light,
red light.

28:14.943 --> 28:16.866
DAN: <i>What did you think
you and the Professor</i>

28:17.029 --> 28:18.576
<i>were going to talk about?</i>

28:18.739 --> 28:24.166
<i>About the work I was doing here
and at university, and...</i>

28:24.328 --> 28:27.081
Actually, he mentioned something
about an environmental report

28:27.247 --> 28:29.170
that he had written.

28:29.333 --> 28:31.335
He was going to talk to me
and Natalie about it.

28:31.501 --> 28:32.923
But I don't know

28:33.086 --> 28:34.258
apart from that.

28:37.966 --> 28:39.058
Thank you.

28:49.770 --> 28:51.192
It's not him, is it?

28:51.355 --> 28:52.197
No.

28:52.356 --> 28:54.108
The boy was kneeling
on top of him

28:54.274 --> 28:58.745
and there wasn't a speck of
Charlie's blood on him anywhere.

28:58.904 --> 29:00.656
But until we have
somebody else in custody,

29:00.822 --> 29:02.290
I'm not letting him walk.

29:02.449 --> 29:03.792
It'll create panic,
like we've lost control.

29:03.951 --> 29:05.043
I wasn't going to let him go.

29:07.329 --> 29:09.297
And what about the girl,
Natalie?

29:09.456 --> 29:10.673
She's not at home.

29:10.832 --> 29:12.049
Her snowmobile's missing.

29:15.087 --> 29:16.134
Yeah.

29:16.296 --> 29:18.094
Gotta find her.

29:32.479 --> 29:34.322
Oh!

29:36.900 --> 29:39.028
(laughing)

29:42.614 --> 29:45.083
How long?

29:45.242 --> 29:47.836
They can't say yet.

29:47.995 --> 29:50.498
They have to allow as much
tissue to recover as possible

29:50.664 --> 29:52.792
before they can make
any decisions.

29:52.958 --> 29:56.087
About amputation?

29:56.253 --> 29:58.176
Yeah.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.384
Where were you?

30:04.511 --> 30:06.229
Where did you go?

30:16.148 --> 30:17.650
Jules, listen.

30:20.694 --> 30:23.493
I know what
you're thinking.

30:25.949 --> 30:28.168
I don't know what to tell you.

30:28.327 --> 30:29.749
I don't know what to say.

30:29.911 --> 30:31.379
I don't know what happened.

30:31.538 --> 30:34.883
I think what happened is

30:35.042 --> 30:39.718
you went out to be
with another woman.

30:39.880 --> 30:42.178
Is that right?

30:52.476 --> 30:53.568
Listen, Jules...

30:53.727 --> 30:55.604
Oh, my God, you were.

30:55.771 --> 30:56.943
Go.

30:57.105 --> 30:58.982
She can have you.

30:59.149 --> 31:00.526
Just go.

31:06.573 --> 31:07.665
(door opens)

31:11.453 --> 31:12.545
Sheriff.

31:12.704 --> 31:14.331
Elena.

31:25.592 --> 31:27.469
Where were you
last night?

31:30.180 --> 31:31.272
What?

31:38.230 --> 31:42.531
Did you meet anyone
last night?

31:46.696 --> 31:47.788
No.

31:51.368 --> 31:53.496
Do you know
Charlie Stoddart?

31:53.662 --> 31:55.164
The man who was killed?

31:55.330 --> 31:56.752
Yes.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.007
Did you know him?

32:00.293 --> 32:01.385
(sighs)

32:02.796 --> 32:04.218
No.

32:04.381 --> 32:06.679
I didn't know him at all.

32:09.803 --> 32:10.895
Okay.

32:12.597 --> 32:14.270
Would you like a drink?

32:40.750 --> 32:41.842
Danny.

33:40.477 --> 33:44.698
HILDUR: <i>How did London
get the news so quickly?</i>

33:44.856 --> 33:47.609
<i>Look, I have 100% confidence
in the Fortitude Police,</i>

33:47.776 --> 33:52.373
<i>but if London are kind enough
to offer us this level</i>

33:52.531 --> 33:55.375
<i>of assistance and experience,
then obviously...</i>

33:58.495 --> 34:00.839
Every consideration.

34:02.165 --> 34:03.337
Yes, thank you.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.929
(foghorn blaring)

34:17.054 --> 34:18.226
(tires crunching snow)

34:32.737 --> 34:33.704
Up here?

34:33.862 --> 34:34.955
Yes.

34:43.415 --> 34:44.507
Do you need a hand?

34:44.666 --> 34:45.792
No, I'm good, thank you.

34:45.958 --> 34:47.677
Great.

34:54.467 --> 34:56.844
Chief Superintendent
Dan Anderssen,

34:57.012 --> 35:00.266
let me introduce Detective
Chief Inspector Eugene Morton.

35:00.432 --> 35:01.433
Hi, Gene.

35:01.600 --> 35:02.897
Dan.

35:05.020 --> 35:06.693
Here, I have a...

35:06.855 --> 35:09.358
This is a commission
rogatory.

35:09.524 --> 35:13.245
It's a cross-border memorandum
of understanding

35:13.403 --> 35:15.997
between Oslo and London
that formalizes my role

35:16.156 --> 35:17.999
as a representative
for the interests

35:18.158 --> 35:19.660
of the family
of the murder victim.

35:23.580 --> 35:24.456
Right.

35:25.999 --> 35:27.342
Ever since they opened
the research center,

35:27.500 --> 35:28.592
there's been this accord.

35:30.045 --> 35:32.173
Not with me.

35:32.339 --> 35:35.183
DCI Morton is
a forensic expert.

35:35.342 --> 35:37.936
He can provide invaluable
analytical skills--

35:38.094 --> 35:39.767
skills and experience
he acquired

35:39.929 --> 35:41.806
working with the FBI.

35:41.973 --> 35:43.225
We have skills.

35:43.391 --> 35:45.018
I'm sure you do.

35:45.185 --> 35:48.985
And also with the International
Aviation Authorities

35:49.147 --> 35:50.114
Air Crash...

35:50.273 --> 35:51.570
...Investigation Unit.

35:51.733 --> 35:52.825
Right.

35:52.984 --> 35:55.863
We don't have
an air crash.

35:56.029 --> 35:58.703
(speaking Norwegian):

36:00.367 --> 36:01.789
I've told DCI Morton

36:01.951 --> 36:03.999
that we will extend him
every consideration.

36:11.503 --> 36:14.222
All right,
if you'll excuse me.

36:14.381 --> 36:15.473
Yeah.

36:20.637 --> 36:22.981
I've never felt cold like this.

36:23.139 --> 36:25.483
My ears actually hurt.

36:30.397 --> 36:31.865
(chuckles)

36:32.023 --> 36:34.822
And I've never seen
a polar bear.

36:38.363 --> 36:39.615
I've never eaten lutefiske.

36:39.781 --> 36:41.454
What?

36:41.616 --> 36:43.038
Lutefiske.

36:43.201 --> 36:43.952
What about it?

36:44.119 --> 36:45.746
I've never eaten it.

36:45.912 --> 36:47.710
I've never tried it.

36:47.872 --> 36:50.921
But there's always a first time
for everything.

36:51.084 --> 36:56.181
And you've never conducted
a murder investigation.

37:00.802 --> 37:02.224
All right, I'll make
a deal with you,

37:02.387 --> 37:04.810
Chief Superintendent Anderssen.

37:04.973 --> 37:06.065
If I'm right.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.352
I'll leave
in a day or two,

37:08.518 --> 37:10.771
but if I'm wrong.

37:10.937 --> 37:12.280
I'll be on the next plane
back to London,

37:12.439 --> 37:14.066
no questions asked,
no recriminations.

37:14.232 --> 37:16.860
What are you talking about?

37:17.026 --> 37:20.496
Outside Professor
Stoddart's house.

37:20.655 --> 37:22.623
I bet there are wind chimes.

37:27.495 --> 37:30.795
You know, in the home counties,
they have a similar signal.

37:30.957 --> 37:33.585
Pampas grass in the garden

37:33.752 --> 37:35.800
means that swingers
live there.

37:35.962 --> 37:37.760
(chimes rattling)

37:37.922 --> 37:40.345
That's not something we have
in Fortitude.

37:40.508 --> 37:42.761
What, sexual infidelity?

37:42.927 --> 37:45.021
Pampas grass.

37:48.933 --> 37:50.935
How did the dog die?

37:51.102 --> 37:52.570
I shot it.

37:54.147 --> 37:55.865
Do you have another one
of those suits I can use?

37:57.567 --> 37:58.659
No.

38:00.987 --> 38:02.409
(wind whistling,
chimes jangling)

38:09.704 --> 38:11.126
Officer?

38:11.289 --> 38:12.381
(knocking)

38:12.540 --> 38:13.632
DCI Morton.

38:13.792 --> 38:14.793
Hi.

38:14.959 --> 38:16.051
Hi, London Met.

38:16.211 --> 38:17.633
I'm here to assist
with the investigation.

38:17.796 --> 38:19.218
Chief Anderssen wanted you

38:19.380 --> 38:21.257
to take me down to the station
straight away.

38:21.424 --> 38:22.266
Really?

38:22.425 --> 38:23.347
Yeah.

38:23.510 --> 38:25.137
Chief Anderssen said that?

38:25.303 --> 38:26.930
Yeah, yeah.

38:27.096 --> 38:28.643
He also said that
you're the best officer

38:28.807 --> 38:30.275
to bring me up to speed.

38:30.433 --> 38:31.776
Shall we?

38:31.935 --> 38:32.777
Sure.

38:32.936 --> 38:33.778
Okay.

38:35.188 --> 38:38.442
Just straight down there.

38:38.608 --> 38:40.702
You could not have been
more helpful, thank you.

38:40.860 --> 38:42.658
My pleasure, sir.

38:46.825 --> 38:48.827
Hi, I'm meeting
Trish Stoddart in...

38:48.993 --> 38:50.210
She's in Dan's office.

38:50.370 --> 38:51.542
Yes, good, thank you.

39:00.255 --> 39:01.347
(knocking lightly)

39:04.968 --> 39:07.016
Oh!

39:07.178 --> 39:08.771
So who are you really, then?

39:08.930 --> 39:10.352
Let me introduce myself
formally, Trish.

39:10.515 --> 39:13.314
I'm Detective Inspector Morton
of the Metropolitan Police.

39:13.476 --> 39:15.774
But you're an American.

39:15.937 --> 39:17.029
Yes.

39:17.188 --> 39:19.782
So can you tell me
what the hell is going on?

39:19.941 --> 39:21.909
Well, I hope so.

39:22.068 --> 39:24.617
I mean, that's why I'm here,
to find out what's going on

39:24.779 --> 39:27.703
and to look out for your best
interests in the investigation.

39:27.866 --> 39:29.914
What investigation?

39:32.036 --> 39:33.128
Nobody's told you?

39:33.288 --> 39:34.414
Told what?

39:34.581 --> 39:36.049
I've been told to wait.

39:36.207 --> 39:38.505
Dan needed
to speak to me.

39:39.961 --> 39:42.305
(sighs)

39:42.463 --> 39:43.555
Okay.

39:46.843 --> 39:50.188
Well, um...

39:50.346 --> 39:52.769
Your husband Charlie is dead.

39:52.932 --> 39:54.058
What?

39:55.935 --> 39:57.687
What?

39:57.854 --> 40:00.277
Somebody or something
assaulted your husband

40:00.440 --> 40:03.410
in your home.

40:03.568 --> 40:05.570
At any rate,
while they were

40:05.737 --> 40:08.035
<i>searching the premises,</i>

40:08.197 --> 40:11.041
<i>it turns out your husband
was still alive,</i>

40:11.200 --> 40:12.998
<i>unbeknownst to them.</i>

40:13.161 --> 40:14.413
TRISH:
<i>He was left?</i>

40:14.579 --> 40:15.956
MORTON:
<i>Yes.</i>

40:16.122 --> 40:18.750
For how long?

40:18.917 --> 40:21.136
An hour.

40:23.171 --> 40:25.799
And as soon as they found out,
they called an ambulance,

40:25.965 --> 40:28.263
<i>they got him to the hospital,
but it was too late.</i>

40:28.426 --> 40:30.929
<i>And he died.</i>

40:32.388 --> 40:34.641
Dan's here to talk to you
about it now.

40:34.807 --> 40:36.229
I'm very sorry.

40:40.104 --> 40:41.651
I thought you knew.

40:45.360 --> 40:46.452
(crying)

40:46.611 --> 40:48.579
I think we can rule out
the grieving widow.

41:08.424 --> 41:09.516
Look, I need a room.

41:09.676 --> 41:11.519
Um...

41:11.678 --> 41:14.227
Please, can you just
get me a room?

41:14.389 --> 41:17.142
I've messed everything up.

41:17.308 --> 41:19.857
I heard something
happened to Liam.

41:20.019 --> 41:22.113
Is he being flown out?

41:22.271 --> 41:25.150
It's much worse than that.

41:25.316 --> 41:27.865
Liam is too sick
to be moved.

41:28.027 --> 41:29.745
Oh.

41:29.904 --> 41:33.374
But look, just... please
just give me a room.

41:33.533 --> 41:35.206
We can talk
about this after.

41:35.368 --> 41:36.836
There are no rooms.

41:36.995 --> 41:38.087
(sighs)

41:47.964 --> 41:49.056
You can use my room.

42:24.751 --> 42:26.344
Hi.

42:26.502 --> 42:27.674
Starting without me?

42:27.837 --> 42:29.965
Who are you?

42:30.131 --> 42:31.383
DCI Morton.

42:31.549 --> 42:32.425
From London?

42:32.592 --> 42:33.434
Mm-hmm.

42:35.428 --> 42:38.932
30 degrees softens up the dried
blood just about right,

42:39.098 --> 42:41.942
and you don't want to use
too much pressure,

42:42.101 --> 42:43.728
because you want to make sure
not to wash away

42:43.895 --> 42:45.488
any secondary
contaminants.

42:47.899 --> 42:49.742
Are you okay
taking notes?

42:49.901 --> 42:52.529
So you're here to help?

42:52.695 --> 42:53.787
That's right.

42:53.946 --> 42:55.323
From London?
Mm-hmm.

42:55.490 --> 42:58.585
But he was only declared dead
12 hours ago.

42:58.743 --> 42:59.869
Mm-hmm.

43:00.036 --> 43:01.663
So...

43:01.829 --> 43:05.504
So how could you have
got here from London

43:05.666 --> 43:07.088
to help with the post-mortem

43:07.251 --> 43:11.051
if you would have had to leave
when he was still alive?

43:11.214 --> 43:13.967
"If you would have had
to leave"

43:14.133 --> 43:16.227
Your English is very good.

43:16.385 --> 43:18.103
Okay, it's already apparent

43:18.262 --> 43:20.481
that more than one
bladed implement was used

43:20.640 --> 43:22.062
in the attack.

43:22.225 --> 43:24.944
The striations here
in the ribs and the sternum

43:25.103 --> 43:26.650
suggest a cleaver,

43:26.813 --> 43:28.941
these long incisions here

43:29.107 --> 43:30.609
are some sort of
stabbing implement,

43:30.775 --> 43:34.496
and then these
triangular punctures

43:34.654 --> 43:38.249
that are all over
the torso,

43:38.407 --> 43:41.411
those suggest a third
assailant, and maybe--

43:41.577 --> 43:44.831
maybe-- that this is some kind
of ritualistic murder.

43:44.997 --> 43:46.965
Ritualistic murder?

43:47.125 --> 43:50.470
What kind of ritualistic murder
would you say involves

43:50.628 --> 43:53.006
a potato peeler?

43:53.172 --> 43:55.391
Hmm?

43:58.469 --> 43:59.971
Get out of here.

44:03.516 --> 44:04.984
I can't do that.

44:19.198 --> 44:21.951
Shall I continue with the
post-mortem examination, boss?

44:24.036 --> 44:25.333
Please, Petra.

44:33.462 --> 44:35.681
Actually, let me
take you through it

44:35.840 --> 44:36.932
from the very beginning.

44:38.968 --> 44:44.520
With this degree of entry,
cardiac output would be impaired

44:44.682 --> 44:46.730
and blood flow
to and from the brain

44:46.893 --> 44:48.770
severely compromised,

44:48.936 --> 44:51.735
and this would mean that
the pulse at the victim's throat

44:51.898 --> 44:54.447
would be barely perceptible.

44:54.609 --> 44:56.782
Pupil dilation response
was next to zero,

44:56.944 --> 44:59.242
and so he appeared dead.

45:05.995 --> 45:07.588
(door closes)

45:07.747 --> 45:09.420
Hildy.

45:12.501 --> 45:13.753
(exhales deeply)

45:16.839 --> 45:18.261
What's the matter?

45:20.426 --> 45:22.520
What, no one's told you?

45:24.555 --> 45:27.024
Told me what?

45:27.183 --> 45:28.810
Charlie Stoddart's
been murdered.

45:30.061 --> 45:31.153
What?

45:31.312 --> 45:36.534
I saw him on the floor,
and he was...

45:36.692 --> 45:37.784
He was all...

45:39.487 --> 45:42.081
(crying):
He was completely split open.

45:42.240 --> 45:43.332
Come here.

45:45.368 --> 45:46.290
(sobbing)

45:46.452 --> 45:47.829
That's terrible.

45:54.126 --> 45:55.218
Jesus Christ!

45:57.797 --> 45:59.720
I know who did it!

46:01.175 --> 46:02.267
NATALIE:
Where are your cigarettes?

46:02.426 --> 46:03.518
MAN:
Right there.

46:03.678 --> 46:04.770
Where?

46:07.848 --> 46:09.020
They're not in your jeans.

46:09.183 --> 46:10.275
MAN:
Try my jacket.

46:29.662 --> 46:31.539
Hey, what the hell is this?

46:35.334 --> 46:36.426
That's mine.

47:07.533 --> 47:11.288
DRIVER: They've got a man in
custody, but they're still looking.

47:11.454 --> 47:13.502
This Professor's chest
was hacked open.

47:13.664 --> 47:14.881
Imagine that.

47:15.041 --> 47:18.420
(passengers murmuring)

47:39.815 --> 47:41.032
Jason.

47:41.192 --> 47:42.409
Jason, pick up, Jason.

47:42.568 --> 47:44.821
For Christ's sake, Jason,
what have you done?

47:57.958 --> 47:59.210
CELIA: <i>You know that
Jason isn't capable</i>

47:59.377 --> 48:00.344
<i>of doing anything like that.</i>

48:00.503 --> 48:01.595
DAN:
<i>Then I have to speak to him.</i>

48:01.754 --> 48:03.677
<i>You shoot to stop,</i>

48:03.839 --> 48:04.431
just like you would a bear.

48:04.590 --> 48:06.467
FRANK: <i>I should have been
there, but I was with you.</i>

48:06.634 --> 48:07.851
CHARLIE: <i>Trish, we might have
found something incredible.</i>

48:08.010 --> 48:10.513
<i>Something that's going to cause
a hell of a lot of trouble.</i>

48:10.679 --> 48:12.056
Is this what got him killed?

48:13.599 --> 48:14.691
VINCENT: <i>He was already
inside the house.</i>

48:14.850 --> 48:15.817
Dan was already there?

48:15.976 --> 48:16.977
Yes.
