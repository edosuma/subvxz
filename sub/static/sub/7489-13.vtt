00:06.130 --> 00:08.358
Ally, you're gonna be
on a magazine cover.

00:08.359 --> 00:10.220
And I've been in
a few magazines.

00:10.221 --> 00:13.223
Let me show you how
to pose like a pro.

00:13.224 --> 00:15.084
Bam!

00:15.683 --> 00:19.480
I don't know. I've taken a lot
of employee I.D. pictures.

00:19.481 --> 00:23.917
I think you should do
something more like this.

00:23.918 --> 00:28.958
Maybe I can try something
that combines the two.

00:34.237 --> 00:36.397
Hi, Dez.

00:37.136 --> 00:38.511
Hey, Ally.

00:38.512 --> 00:41.930
I'm flattered, but
not interested.

00:41.931 --> 00:45.188
I'm not flirting with you.
I'm practicing poses.

00:45.189 --> 00:49.226
I'm gonna be on the cover of Miami Music.
They named me their songwriter of the year.

00:49.227 --> 00:51.046
Woo! That's a relief.

00:51.047 --> 00:54.386
A photographer's coming over
tonight to take her picture.

00:54.387 --> 00:57.438
Hey, I haven't gotten fired
from Tranquility Spa yet.

00:57.439 --> 01:00.658
Why don't you come over for a
day of beauty and relaxation?

01:00.659 --> 01:04.825
Ooh, I can't. The South Beach
chili cook-off is today.

01:04.825 --> 01:07.406
Not you. Ally.

01:07.558 --> 01:11.014
I have too much to do today. I have
to pick up my dress from the cleaners

01:11.015 --> 01:13.755
and go to my Grandma's to borrow
her necklace for the photo shoot.

01:13.756 --> 01:16.867
- Can't you wear just any necklace?
- No, I really wanna wear that one.

01:16.868 --> 01:19.201
It's been in my family
for generations.

01:19.202 --> 01:22.866
- It would mean a lot to her.
- I can get all that stuff for you.

01:22.867 --> 01:26.096
Wait. Is it the Grandma that
makes delicious cookies

01:26.097 --> 01:29.722
or the one that tells really boring
stories and smells like cabbage?

01:29.723 --> 01:32.194
- Cookies.
- Yes! Woo!

01:32.195 --> 01:35.077
But, Austin, you said you would help
me with the chili cook-off today.

01:35.078 --> 01:37.007
There's plenty of
time for everything.

01:37.008 --> 01:40.297
Ally, go to the spa. You
deserve a relaxing day.

01:40.298 --> 01:42.076
Thanks, Austin.

01:42.077 --> 01:44.823
Trish, let's go have
our day of beauty.

01:44.824 --> 01:48.452
Wish I could get a massage. This chili
cook-off has really stressed me out.

01:48.453 --> 01:51.248
Hey, Trish, could you give
me a quick little neck rub?

01:51.249 --> 01:55.026
Really? You want me to put
my hands on your neck?

01:55.027 --> 01:58.627
On second thought, I'm good.

02:59.409 --> 03:02.063
All right, here are the
pot's, what else do we need?

03:02.064 --> 03:05.184
Let's check the list.

03:07.632 --> 03:13.152
Probably shouldn't have left
this on the cutting board.

03:13.278 --> 03:16.512
Anyone seen this redheaded...

03:16.513 --> 03:18.733
Dezperado?

03:19.811 --> 03:23.585
Hi, Chuck. Still carrying around
that stupid wanted poster?

03:23.586 --> 03:26.743
Nobody thinks it's funny.

03:26.744 --> 03:29.051
Wanted for making bad chili.

03:29.052 --> 03:31.152
Classic.

03:31.797 --> 03:35.032
Thought about where you're gonna put
your Second Place certificate this year?

03:35.033 --> 03:37.462
I'll probably frame it and
give it to my Grandma.

03:37.463 --> 03:39.574
She'll put it on her 'fridge and...
wait.

03:39.575 --> 03:43.730
I'm not coming in Second Place.
I'm gonna win.

03:43.731 --> 03:46.590
Yeah, just because you beat him
last year and the year before

03:46.591 --> 03:48.767
that and the year before that
and the year before that,

03:48.768 --> 03:51.066
doesn't mean you
beat him every year.

03:51.067 --> 03:53.818
Uh, yeah, it does.

03:53.819 --> 03:56.053
I'll see you out at the chili
round-up at high noon.

03:56.054 --> 03:57.888
The chili cook-off's at 3:00.

03:57.889 --> 03:59.518
You know what I mean.

03:59.519 --> 04:02.378
Oh, we'll be there,
Chucky the kid.

04:02.379 --> 04:06.527
Because I'm the fastest chili maker
in the west... side of the Mall.

04:06.528 --> 04:08.448
Draw!

04:11.069 --> 04:13.769
Man, he's good.

04:15.907 --> 04:18.607
Adios, muchachos.

04:19.778 --> 04:22.120
You're not worried, are you?

04:22.120 --> 04:24.815
Not at all. The spiciest
chili always wins,

04:24.816 --> 04:27.785
and this year, I have
a secret weapon.

04:27.786 --> 04:30.385
They call it the
Your Mommy Pepper.

04:30.386 --> 04:33.056
Because one taste and you're
crying for your mommy.

04:33.057 --> 04:35.959
Chuck'll be crying for his mommy,
because you're finally gonna beat him.

04:35.960 --> 04:38.962
All I need is one little scoop.
Now we have to be careful.

04:38.963 --> 04:43.190
You do not wanna get this on your finger...
ow! My finger!

04:43.191 --> 04:45.411
My shirt!

04:46.971 --> 04:48.891
Whoa!

04:48.979 --> 04:52.819
You are so gonna win this year.

05:02.244 --> 05:05.499
Spending the day at a beauty
spa was a great idea, Trish.

05:05.500 --> 05:08.692
Shh! We're supposed
to be relaxing.

05:08.693 --> 05:10.944
Trish! What are you doing?

05:10.945 --> 05:12.625
You're supposed to be working.

05:12.626 --> 05:14.341
I am, Madame Trinka.

05:14.342 --> 05:17.957
I'm showing this customer
how to properly relax.

05:17.958 --> 05:21.922
I need you to wash the
towels, refill the waters,

05:21.923 --> 05:24.872
and wipe down the
massage tables.

05:24.873 --> 05:27.508
I'm watching you.

05:27.509 --> 05:31.889
Don't worry, I'm working.
I'm working.

05:32.226 --> 05:38.126
I guess I have to go pretend to work
now, but you stay here and relax.

05:38.758 --> 05:41.346
This coconut water is kind of...

05:41.347 --> 05:42.616
Thick.

05:42.617 --> 05:45.557
That's massage oil.

05:45.733 --> 05:46.670
Oh!

05:46.671 --> 05:49.376
Sorry. I probably shouldn't
have put that there.

05:49.377 --> 05:52.112
I guess it does kind
of look like water.

05:52.113 --> 05:55.236
Do you need anything
else before I go?

05:55.237 --> 05:58.850
My foot bath's getting
kind of cold.

05:58.851 --> 06:02.890
The hot water's all
the way in the back.

06:02.891 --> 06:05.309
I'll just put a couple
of these hot rocks in.

06:05.310 --> 06:07.294
Why do you have hot rocks?

06:07.295 --> 06:09.129
We use them for hot
rock massages.

06:09.130 --> 06:12.945
It's supposed to be
really relaxing.

06:12.946 --> 06:15.202
Ow! Ow! Ow!

06:15.203 --> 06:18.238
There's nothing
relaxing about that.

06:18.239 --> 06:20.974
I said supposed to be.

06:20.975 --> 06:22.775
Oh!

06:28.567 --> 06:32.775
I know your chili powder's hot, but do
you really need to wear a gas mask?

06:32.776 --> 06:36.116
Oh, this isn't for the powder. There's
a hundred people here eating chili.

06:36.117 --> 06:38.368
Do you wanna breathe that air?

06:38.369 --> 06:41.930
You're right. Got
another one of those?

06:41.931 --> 06:44.216
Grade-a hot beef coming through.

06:44.217 --> 06:46.918
Oh, yeah, and I've
got my chili, too.

06:46.919 --> 06:48.586
Hoo-hoo!

06:48.587 --> 06:51.722
You know, I'm glad they put us next
to each other this year, Chucky.

06:51.723 --> 06:54.585
I won't have to walk so far to
laugh in your face when I win.

06:54.586 --> 06:57.443
- Oh!
- You got burned...

06:57.444 --> 07:00.264
Like my tongue will be
when I eat Dez's chili.

07:00.265 --> 07:02.337
What up?!

07:02.338 --> 07:06.100
Blondie, you wouldn't know good chili
if it knocked on your door and said...

07:06.101 --> 07:11.381
"Hi. Allow me to introduce myself.
I'm good chili".

07:11.964 --> 07:15.179
Chili wouldn't do that.

07:15.180 --> 07:18.115
Hey, Dez, I'm here to
take my test on Chile.

07:18.116 --> 07:20.317
Nelson, I want you to
taste test my chili,

07:20.318 --> 07:23.062
not take a test on the
country of Chile.

07:23.063 --> 07:24.703
Aw, nartz!

07:24.704 --> 07:29.326
You mean I learned Santiago is the
capital of Chile for nothing?

07:29.327 --> 07:32.887
Well, we have two hours to
kill while my chili simmers.

07:32.888 --> 07:35.298
Great. That'll give me
time to get Ally's dress

07:35.299 --> 07:37.201
and get the necklace
from her Grandma.

07:37.202 --> 07:40.982
Nelson, ready to test my chili?

07:43.341 --> 07:45.008
Well?

07:45.009 --> 07:46.820
It's not hot at all.

07:46.821 --> 07:51.281
Ugh! You have an unusually
high tolerance for spicy food.

07:51.282 --> 07:54.317
I'll know my chili's hot enough
to win when you can taste it.

07:54.318 --> 07:57.254
I mean, if a regular person
tasted my chili right now,

07:57.255 --> 08:01.125
they'd be sweating like crazy.
They wouldn't be able to speak.

08:01.126 --> 08:06.185
Their mouths would be so on fire, they'd
chug a fruit juice just to ease the pain.

08:06.186 --> 08:08.581
But they'd quickly
realize that the acids

08:08.582 --> 08:13.442
from the fruit would
only make it hurt worse.

08:13.489 --> 08:19.389
Hopefully, they'd realize that the only
thing that can ease the pain is milk.

08:20.651 --> 08:23.346
Hey, gimme that!

08:23.347 --> 08:28.252
And that's why you're my
taste tester, Nelson.

08:28.253 --> 08:33.991
Austin, quit sitting around.
You gotta go get Ally's stuff.

08:33.991 --> 08:36.994
You shrunk the bath towels!

08:36.995 --> 08:41.710
You spill wheat grass juice everywhere
and left it for me to clean up.

08:41.711 --> 08:45.035
And you make wheat grass
juice too strong.

08:45.036 --> 08:47.981
Look, you stained my hands.

08:47.982 --> 08:50.058
All I did was ask for a raise.

08:50.059 --> 08:52.529
A simple yes or no
would have been fine.

08:52.530 --> 08:54.750
No raise!

09:00.251 --> 09:02.186
Sorry about your feet.

09:02.187 --> 09:05.923
The good news is Miami Music
magazine will probably

09:05.924 --> 09:08.258
only shoot you
from the waist up.

09:08.259 --> 09:11.790
That volumizer I put in your hair
is gonna make it look great.

09:11.791 --> 09:15.811
There's only one
way to find out.

09:16.375 --> 09:18.035
Um...

09:18.036 --> 09:23.936
Maybe we can get the photographer to
focus on that pretty smile of yours.

09:25.276 --> 09:27.077
You drank the wheat
grass, didn't you?

09:27.078 --> 09:29.298
Yes, why?

09:32.216 --> 09:35.876
- What? Want some?
- Mnh-mnh.

09:43.812 --> 09:45.406
How do my teeth look?

09:45.407 --> 09:47.807
Much better.

09:48.850 --> 09:52.119
But I would still smile with my
mouth closed for the picture.

09:52.120 --> 09:54.789
I can't do the photo
shoot looking like this.

09:54.790 --> 09:57.758
Look, we'll fix your teeth.
We'll fix your hair.

09:57.759 --> 10:01.095
And if we can't,
we'll put a hat on.

10:01.096 --> 10:02.709
Just relax.

10:02.710 --> 10:05.338
Here, put your hands
in this paraffin wax.

10:05.339 --> 10:07.301
It's really soothing.

10:07.302 --> 10:09.387
I don't think I can re...

10:09.388 --> 10:11.697
Ooh, that does
kind of feel nice.

10:11.698 --> 10:15.495
See? And I'll put this
face mask on you.

10:15.496 --> 10:20.716
I'll have you looking and
feeling as good as new.

10:20.748 --> 10:22.932
Close your eyes...

10:22.933 --> 10:24.913
Relax.

10:30.158 --> 10:33.620
Hi, you're here for
your massage, right?

10:33.621 --> 10:37.296
I'm so sorry. Ingrid
went home sick.

10:37.297 --> 10:40.177
Come back tomorrow.

10:41.903 --> 10:46.163
Hi, Ingrid. I'm ready
for my massage.

10:55.150 --> 10:56.884
Can you taste the heat?

10:56.885 --> 10:59.629
I taste a Second
Place certificate.

10:59.630 --> 11:01.490
Ugh!

11:02.225 --> 11:05.351
Come here, little feller,
and taste some real chili.

11:05.352 --> 11:11.252
My chili's so hot, you have to stick
your tongue in fire to cool it off.

11:12.200 --> 11:17.348
Oh, yeah? Well, my chili's so hot,
NASA uses it for rocket fuel.

11:17.349 --> 11:22.720
My chili's so hot, it's the second
leading cause of Global Warming.

11:22.721 --> 11:24.568
Well, my chili's so hot,

11:24.569 --> 11:28.788
you have to put a smoke detector in
your underwear before you eat it.

11:28.789 --> 11:33.307
My chili's so hot, they're
thinking about renaming the sun...

11:33.308 --> 11:35.475
"My chili".

11:35.476 --> 11:39.159
Yeah, well, my chili's
so hot, it...

11:39.160 --> 11:40.846
It...

11:40.847 --> 11:45.099
What's the matter? Can't think of
anything else? Don't feel bad.

11:45.100 --> 11:50.320
I also won first place in
the smack talk showdown.

11:51.135 --> 11:54.555
You know what? That's it!

11:54.876 --> 11:57.202
Hey, Dez, I got Ally's stuff.

11:57.203 --> 12:00.501
Oh, sorry it took so long.
Ally lied.

12:00.502 --> 12:03.747
It was the boring story Grandma.

12:03.748 --> 12:08.022
Apparently, this necklace has
been in the family for 200 years.

12:08.023 --> 12:10.632
It was originally a gift to
a Duchess from a pirate.

12:10.633 --> 12:12.138
Wow, a pirate?

12:12.139 --> 12:14.600
Or it could have been a pilot.

12:14.601 --> 12:17.965
It was hard to tell. Granny
didn't have her teeth in.

12:17.966 --> 12:20.935
Whoa, did you just put
that whole jar in there?

12:20.936 --> 12:24.889
Yep. I am not losing to
that cow-jerk again.

12:24.890 --> 12:26.140
Taste this, Nelson.

12:26.141 --> 12:30.413
It's got a whole jar of
Your Mommy Pepper in it.

12:30.414 --> 12:32.068
Well?

12:32.069 --> 12:34.049
Mommy!

12:34.661 --> 12:37.519
Whoa! The necklace.

12:37.520 --> 12:40.460
Get a ladle, quick.

12:45.391 --> 12:50.671
- Where'd the pot go?
- It's on the judges' table.

12:51.230 --> 12:54.781
All the pots look the same. There's no way
to know which one has the necklace in it.

12:54.782 --> 12:57.379
We are in so much trouble.

12:57.380 --> 12:59.299
That's right. You're in trouble.

12:59.300 --> 13:02.407
Your chili's so bad, when
people are having a bad day,

13:02.408 --> 13:07.148
they say they're having
a Dez's chili day.

13:08.176 --> 13:12.556
I think I'm having
a Dez's chili day.

13:19.706 --> 13:21.456
We've gotta find that necklace.

13:21.457 --> 13:22.758
Okay, but we gotta be careful.

13:22.759 --> 13:28.659
I don't wanna do anything that
might make me lose the cook-off.

13:29.432 --> 13:32.333
Excuse me. Could you tell
me which chili's mine?

13:32.334 --> 13:33.839
I just need to check
it real quick.

13:33.840 --> 13:37.200
Step away from the chili!

13:37.438 --> 13:40.440
No one touches these pots until
after the blind taste test.

13:40.441 --> 13:44.555
For all I know, you could be
sabotaging someone else's chili.

13:44.556 --> 13:47.279
Do I look like someone
that would do that?

13:47.280 --> 13:50.015
Do I look like someone who
collects porcelain cats?

13:50.016 --> 13:53.522
We've all got things to hide.

13:53.523 --> 13:55.178
But there's something
special in that pot.

13:55.179 --> 13:56.839
I'll be the Judge of that.

13:56.840 --> 13:59.070
Literally. Because
I'm the Judge.

13:59.071 --> 14:02.582
So you're saying there's no way I
can touch my chili just for a sec?

14:02.583 --> 14:04.230
- Oh, there's a way.
- Great.

14:04.231 --> 14:07.690
- If you want to be disqualified.
- Oh! Never.

14:07.691 --> 14:10.484
Now get out of here. I don't
want any beef from you.

14:10.485 --> 14:14.536
Literally. Because I'm
judging Vegetarian chilis.

14:14.537 --> 14:16.119
What are we gonna do now?

14:16.120 --> 14:17.715
We're gonna look
through all this chili

14:17.716 --> 14:22.516
without letting anyone
know what we're doing.

14:23.850 --> 14:25.678
Hey, Judge.

14:25.679 --> 14:28.478
How do you become a chili Judge?

14:28.479 --> 14:31.293
Do you Judge any other foods?

14:31.294 --> 14:35.134
Stew, breakfast
cereals, cobblers?

14:35.145 --> 14:39.045
Hey, look, it's a space shuttle!

14:44.438 --> 14:47.228
Here's my idea. I'm gonna throw
this football to that Judge.

14:47.229 --> 14:49.784
When he tries to catch it, he'll
drop his bowl on the floor.

14:49.785 --> 14:53.789
Then we'll be able to see if the necklace
is in it, it's a foolproof plan.

14:53.790 --> 14:56.130
Hey, catch.

15:02.202 --> 15:08.102
Okay, if we can't get to the chili from
the top, we'll go in from the bottom.

15:12.311 --> 15:17.231
Dez, I don't think this
is such a good idea.

15:29.690 --> 15:34.096
No necklace, but I'm pretty sure I
know which one's coming in last place.

15:34.097 --> 15:36.440
Two words... nas...

15:36.441 --> 15:38.301
Tee.

15:43.309 --> 15:48.072
Your skin is gonna look
so good in this photo.

15:48.073 --> 15:49.287
Huh.

15:49.288 --> 15:52.408
What do you mean huh?

15:52.444 --> 15:54.206
Did I say huh?

15:54.207 --> 15:57.579
I'm sorry. I meant to say
your entire face is pink.

15:57.580 --> 15:59.560
What?!

16:00.246 --> 16:02.018
Hair dye?

16:02.019 --> 16:03.521
Seriously?

16:03.522 --> 16:06.639
My hair, my teeth
and now my face?

16:06.640 --> 16:10.960
Well, there's nothing
else to mess up.

16:11.027 --> 16:14.709
Um, Trish, my hands are stuck.

16:14.710 --> 16:16.220
I stand corrected.

16:16.221 --> 16:18.381
Help me.

16:20.266 --> 16:22.267
Wow, this stuff is sticky.

16:22.268 --> 16:25.051
How have you not been fired?

16:25.052 --> 16:27.968
Actually, I was fired
two hours ago.

16:27.969 --> 16:31.221
Madame Trinka's right.
I'm the worst.

16:31.222 --> 16:34.345
I just wanted you to have a nice
time before your photo shoot,

16:34.346 --> 16:36.667
and now I've ruined everything.

16:36.668 --> 16:39.668
I'm so sorry, Ally.

16:39.794 --> 16:43.771
It's okay. I know
you meant well.

16:43.772 --> 16:49.672
I'm also sorry that I just put my hands
on my face because now they're stuck!

16:49.757 --> 16:51.557
Oh!

16:52.104 --> 16:54.204
Ah! Ah!

16:54.341 --> 16:58.361
Those aren't supposed
to be there.

16:59.418 --> 17:01.120
I'm sorry, it's not funny.
It's not funny.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.521
- No.
- No.

17:11.641 --> 17:14.480
Aw, man, they're passing
the chili out to everyone.

17:14.481 --> 17:17.339
Oh, great. I can't wait to see
their reactions to my chili.

17:17.339 --> 17:18.811
I'm sure to win.

17:18.813 --> 17:21.094
My point is there's too
much chili to look through.

17:21.095 --> 17:25.234
We're never gonna
find the necklace.

17:25.332 --> 17:27.814
Uh-oh, here comes
Ally and Trish.

17:27.815 --> 17:30.431
Hmm. There's something
different about you guys.

17:30.432 --> 17:34.318
Yeah, her face is pink, and
I don't have any eyebrows.

17:34.319 --> 17:37.259
No, that's not it.

17:39.541 --> 17:42.675
Ally, there's something
we have to tell you.

17:42.676 --> 17:44.031
- I'll tell her.
- I'll tell her.

17:44.032 --> 17:45.834
- No, I'll tell her.
- No, I'll tell her.

17:45.835 --> 17:47.535
- Fine, you tell her.
- Fine, you tell her.

17:47.536 --> 17:50.906
- Okay, w-w-wait, stop talking.
- Okay, w-w-wait, stop talking.

17:50.907 --> 17:53.809
Guys, will one of you just
tell us what's going...

17:53.810 --> 17:56.508
- Oh, come on!
- Oh, come on!

17:56.509 --> 17:59.685
Ally, I lost your
Grandmother's necklace.

17:59.686 --> 18:03.752
What?! That necklace has
been in my family forever.

18:03.753 --> 18:05.887
Granny's gonna be so devastated.

18:05.888 --> 18:07.555
We can still find it.

18:07.556 --> 18:13.456
It's in one of those bowls of chili.
I just don't know which one.

18:13.675 --> 18:17.779
I didn't wanna have to do this because it
could mean I lose the chili cook-off but

18:17.780 --> 18:20.360
for you, Ally.

18:20.516 --> 18:22.154
Attention, chili fans.

18:22.155 --> 18:25.073
There's a hidden necklace in one
of these pots or bowls of chili.

18:25.074 --> 18:28.734
Whoever finds it wins $1,000!

18:30.759 --> 18:33.628
- Do any of you guys have $1,000?
- No.

18:33.629 --> 18:38.249
We better find it before
anyone else does.

18:47.971 --> 18:52.471
Wait, stop. You're
ruining the cook-off!

19:27.596 --> 19:32.021
We've gone through all the chili
and no one's found my necklace.

19:32.022 --> 19:33.873
Wait...

19:33.874 --> 19:35.944
- There's one bowl left.
- Oh!

19:35.945 --> 19:37.399
The necklace has
gotta be in there.

19:37.400 --> 19:38.954
Then that must be my chili.

19:38.955 --> 19:43.002
Since it's the only one left for the judges
to taste, I'm automatically gonna win.

19:43.003 --> 19:45.823
Not so fast, Red.

19:47.898 --> 19:51.033
If I get that bowl first,
you ain't winning nothing.

19:51.034 --> 19:53.936
Looks like it's just
me and you, Chucky.

19:53.937 --> 19:56.839
This Mall ain't big enough
for the both of us.

19:56.840 --> 20:02.490
Actually, the Mall's capacity is 2,847,
and that doesn't include parking lots.

20:02.491 --> 20:04.591
Proceed.

20:06.683 --> 20:08.083
That chili's mine.

20:08.084 --> 20:09.952
I'm finally gonna beat you.

20:09.953 --> 20:13.553
Not if I dump it out first.

20:26.043 --> 20:27.963
Draw.

20:55.384 --> 20:58.324
- I got it!
- Woo!

21:00.554 --> 21:02.102
Let me just...

21:02.103 --> 21:06.123
Thanks, Dez. That
was really sweet.

21:08.343 --> 21:12.783
By the way, one of
you owes me $1,000.

21:16.937 --> 21:21.531
Grandma, I won the chili
cook-off this year!

21:21.532 --> 21:24.877
Make room on your 'fridge
for my first place ribbon.

21:24.878 --> 21:27.880
Actually, make room for two.

21:27.881 --> 21:33.161
I plan on winning the
barbecue sauce cook-off, too.

21:33.720 --> 21:36.540
Not so fast, Red.

21:37.099 --> 21:39.658
Gotta go, Grandma.

21:39.659 --> 21:42.762
The barbecue sauce with the
strongest flavor wins.

21:42.763 --> 21:44.864
And that's gonna be mine.

21:44.865 --> 21:49.902
My sauce is so strong, it can
do 50 one-handed push-ups.

21:49.903 --> 21:50.936
Oh, yeah?

21:50.937 --> 21:55.941
Well, my sauce is so strong, it won an
olympic gold medal in weightlifting.

21:55.942 --> 22:00.547
My sauce is so strong, when
Superheroes are in trouble...

22:00.548 --> 22:03.619
They call my sauce for help.

22:03.620 --> 22:08.705
My sauce is so strong, it's doing
a buddy cop movie with The Rock.

22:08.706 --> 22:13.486
My sauce is so strong, they're
thinking about renaming Hercules...

22:13.487 --> 22:16.187
"My sauce-ules".

22:16.916 --> 22:21.070
Okay, that one doesn't
even make sense.
