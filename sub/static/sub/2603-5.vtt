Ross.

00:12.600 --> 00:13.768
Triple double,

00:13.803 --> 00:15.100
courtesy of
America's favorite burger chain.

00:15.134 --> 00:17.134
Louis won
the class-action suit?

00:17.169 --> 00:22.102
♪ 10,000 men of Harvard
want victory today ♪

00:22.137 --> 00:24.669
All: ♪ for they know that
o'er old Eli ♪

00:24.703 --> 00:27.237
♪ fair Harvard holds sway ♪

00:27.271 --> 00:31.572
♪ so we'll conquer
all old Eli's men ♪

00:31.607 --> 00:34.179
My favorite part.

00:34.214 --> 00:35.981
You don't know the lyrics,
do you?

00:37.216 --> 00:39.486
I don't even know the lyrics,
Louis.

00:39.520 --> 00:41.523
Now are we practicing law
down here,

00:41.558 --> 00:43.326
or auditioning
a chorus line?

00:43.361 --> 00:45.198
It's called
<i>esprit de corps.</i>

00:45.233 --> 00:47.903
And I just got a $100 million
jury award overturned.

00:47.937 --> 00:49.405
I don't have to overturn
awards like that

00:49.439 --> 00:51.408
because I've never lost one
in the first place.

00:53.679 --> 00:55.147
So what is this,
a new cologne

00:55.181 --> 00:56.783
or just a hint of jealousy?

00:56.817 --> 00:57.920
I'm surprised you, uh,

00:57.954 --> 00:59.656
don't recognize
your wife's perfume.

00:59.690 --> 01:02.025
I know,
you're not married.

01:02.059 --> 01:04.962
It's still funny.

01:04.997 --> 01:06.330
You do realize
we're celebrating

01:06.365 --> 01:08.098
making fat people
even fatter, right?

01:08.133 --> 01:09.199
If you wanted
to do good,

01:09.234 --> 01:10.768
you should've been
a fake doctor.

01:12.405 --> 01:14.840
Business cards.

01:14.874 --> 01:16.508
Yup.

01:16.543 --> 01:18.812
My mistake is now official.
Come with me.

01:20.449 --> 01:23.719
And learn the goddamn lyrics
to the Harvard song, will ya?

01:23.753 --> 01:27.991
Oakhurst Capital has agreed to
a $200 million licensing deal.

01:28.025 --> 01:29.592
We are at the goal line.

01:29.627 --> 01:31.162
How are we
on brand protection?

01:31.196 --> 01:32.430
The contract is airtight.

01:32.464 --> 01:33.664
The only issue here

01:33.699 --> 01:36.102
is to get the Joyful Toy Company
to close.

01:36.136 --> 01:38.071
I'll go over it with Joy
one-on-one.

01:46.250 --> 01:48.051
- Uh...
- And if it does ring,

01:48.086 --> 01:49.152
you answer it.

01:49.186 --> 01:50.920
Oh. Yeah.

01:50.955 --> 01:52.422
Not in here.

01:52.456 --> 01:54.390
I--okay.

01:54.425 --> 01:56.492
Don't feel the need
to rush back when you're done.

01:56.527 --> 01:58.161
Who is this?

01:58.195 --> 01:59.562
Dude, it's Trevor.
Don't hang up.

01:59.596 --> 02:01.030
I only get one call.

02:01.064 --> 02:03.032
I'm in jail.

02:03.066 --> 02:04.500
I--I tried to hop this bus
at Port Authority.

02:04.534 --> 02:07.002
I was drunk.
It's all messed up.

02:07.037 --> 02:09.237
Look, I know we haven't talked
since we fought,

02:09.271 --> 02:12.641
but I didn't know
who else to call.

02:16.646 --> 02:18.747
Hey.

02:20.917 --> 02:24.387
I'm sorry, man.
I'm sorry.

02:24.422 --> 02:27.824
Okay.

02:27.859 --> 02:30.961
- I'm gonna pay you back.
- Yeah, you better.

02:30.996 --> 02:33.664
Your bail cost me
everything I have in the bank.

02:33.699 --> 02:34.732
The thing is,

02:34.767 --> 02:36.934
I don't have the money.

02:36.969 --> 02:38.336
What are you
talking about?

02:38.370 --> 02:40.538
You're clearing
$10,000 a month selling weed.

02:40.573 --> 02:42.040
It went out
as fast as it came in.

02:42.074 --> 02:43.909
Came in?

02:43.943 --> 02:46.144
I quit.
I'm not dealing anymore.

02:46.179 --> 02:49.014
- Bullshit.
- I'm serious.

02:49.048 --> 02:52.184
After we fought,
I don't know.

02:52.218 --> 02:54.420
Things just
started to fall apart.

02:54.454 --> 02:55.654
Jenny broke up with me.

02:59.025 --> 03:00.225
I didn't know.

03:00.259 --> 03:03.128
Well, I just realized
I needed to make a change.

03:03.162 --> 03:06.498
Even sold my bong.

03:06.532 --> 03:08.333
What have you done
with my friend?

03:08.367 --> 03:09.834
Yeah.
You should talk.

03:09.869 --> 03:11.769
Look at you. You look like
Gordon Gekko's little brother.

03:12.939 --> 03:14.506
What, are you
working on Wall Street, man?

03:14.540 --> 03:18.410
Why'd you call me,
Trevor?

03:18.445 --> 03:21.982
You're the one person
I knew would show up.

03:23.784 --> 03:27.288
You want to ask me
for anything...else?

03:27.322 --> 03:29.523
Look, all I care about
right now

03:29.558 --> 03:31.025
is keeping my record clean.

03:33.228 --> 03:35.063
You don't happen to know
any good lawyers, do ya?

03:38.234 --> 03:40.563
No. I don't.

04:24.293 --> 04:25.443
Why the rush now?

04:25.444 --> 04:27.913
You've already wasted
ten minutes of my life.

04:27.947 --> 04:28.980
Please tell me
you didn't wait ten minutes

04:29.015 --> 04:30.448
just to scold me.

04:30.482 --> 04:31.849
I've been waiting for you
to bring the paperwork down

04:31.883 --> 04:34.719
so I can close
a nine-figure licensing deal.

04:36.088 --> 04:38.221
If your phone rings
while I'm talking to Ray,

04:38.256 --> 04:39.656
I'm throwing it
out of the car

04:39.690 --> 04:42.325
while it's attached
to your hand.

04:42.360 --> 04:44.060
Eddie Hope
and the Mannish Boys.

04:44.095 --> 04:46.396
1959, three guesses.

04:46.430 --> 04:47.764
Guesses?

04:51.167 --> 04:54.569
You insult me,
Harvey.

04:54.603 --> 04:56.004
Don't worry,
we won't be late.

05:04.280 --> 05:06.648
Okay, what was the name
of the record label?

05:06.683 --> 05:08.283
Marlin records.

05:08.317 --> 05:10.685
Who covered it
in the late '60s?

05:10.720 --> 05:13.255
Ahh! I want to say
The Stones, but--

05:13.289 --> 05:14.556
You need some guesses?

05:14.591 --> 05:18.460
Oh!
Oh, my God.

05:22.497 --> 05:23.764
Just like
a private car service, huh?

05:23.798 --> 05:24.999
Thinking
you don't have to yield?

05:25.033 --> 05:27.801
What? Yield?
You ran a red light!

05:27.835 --> 05:29.736
That light was yellow!

05:29.770 --> 05:31.371
No, sir,
it was not!

05:31.405 --> 05:32.505
Are you calling me a liar?

05:32.539 --> 05:33.973
- Back off.
- Mind your business, okay?

05:34.007 --> 05:36.309
- No, I'm minding my business.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

05:36.343 --> 05:37.544
Anyone throws a punch,

05:37.578 --> 05:38.711
or I'm gonna introduce you
to Mr. Taser.

05:38.746 --> 05:40.146
Trade insurance,

05:40.181 --> 05:41.582
I'll take reports,
one at a time.

05:41.616 --> 05:43.684
Yeah, as much as
I'd like to help you out,

05:43.718 --> 05:44.685
I'm late for a meeting.
No, no, no.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.087
You're not going anywhere.

05:46.121 --> 05:48.924
I need a statement
from you too.

05:48.958 --> 05:51.360
Here's mine.

05:51.395 --> 05:53.696
I need you to babysit
the client till I get there.

05:53.730 --> 05:55.965
And don't mention the deal.
If she asks any questions,

05:56.000 --> 05:58.234
just nod your head
and look pretty.

06:11.814 --> 06:14.515
Ms. McAfee, I'm Mike Ross.
I work with Harvey.

06:14.549 --> 06:17.584
Oh, you're the protege that
he's been gushing about.

06:17.619 --> 06:19.153
He was gushing?

06:19.187 --> 06:20.488
Well, he mentioned
that you existed.

06:20.522 --> 06:21.789
For Harvey,
that's gushing.

06:21.823 --> 06:24.158
Uh, he's running
a few minutes late today.

06:24.192 --> 06:25.559
Um, car trouble.

06:25.594 --> 06:27.528
I was just about to have tea
with the girls.

06:27.563 --> 06:28.863
Would you care to join me?

06:28.897 --> 06:30.031
I'd love to.

06:30.065 --> 06:31.098
Good.

06:31.133 --> 06:34.001
And for heaven's sakes,
call me Joy.

06:34.035 --> 06:35.369
Okay, Joy.

06:35.403 --> 06:36.604
These...

06:36.638 --> 06:38.305
Are the girls.

06:38.340 --> 06:39.673
Susie, Sarah,

06:39.708 --> 06:42.176
Stacy, Sinclair,

06:42.210 --> 06:43.377
and Sabrina.

06:43.411 --> 06:45.078
Susie,
where are your manners?

06:45.113 --> 06:46.813
Shake hands
with this nice young man.

06:52.319 --> 06:54.687
Mm...

06:54.722 --> 06:56.455
Just kidding,
I know they're dolls.

06:56.490 --> 06:58.324
Oh.

06:58.359 --> 07:00.193
They're named
after my daughters.

07:00.227 --> 07:02.429
I started the company
because of them, really.

07:02.463 --> 07:04.131
You know,
dolls didn't used to be

07:04.166 --> 07:08.303
these cheap, plastic bimbos
from China that we have today.

07:08.337 --> 07:10.638
Your mother made them for you
by hand.

07:10.673 --> 07:13.908
I wanted my girls to have
that same experience.

07:13.943 --> 07:16.044
And here we are,
30 years later.

07:16.079 --> 07:18.413
Every parent's
worst nightmare.

07:18.448 --> 07:19.714
What do you mean?

07:19.749 --> 07:23.185
These little angels,
they sell for $90 a pop.

07:23.220 --> 07:25.288
I wasn't born with a butler,
you know.

07:25.322 --> 07:26.823
I gotta say,
this is amazing,

07:26.857 --> 07:29.058
taking on a project
like a licensing deal.

07:29.092 --> 07:30.493
Why is that amazing?

07:30.527 --> 07:32.528
Well, my grandmother
could never pull this off.

07:32.562 --> 07:35.998
She's been retired
for ten years.

07:36.033 --> 07:37.333
How is that treating her?

07:37.367 --> 07:38.534
She lives near
my apartment.

07:38.568 --> 07:40.102
I get to see her
once a week, so...

07:40.136 --> 07:42.371
- That's very sweet of you.
- No.

07:42.405 --> 07:44.172
No, it's not.

07:45.775 --> 07:51.146
You know, whenever I needed her,
she was there.

07:51.180 --> 07:52.681
You know,
no matter what.

07:52.715 --> 07:54.817
She'd give me a hug,

07:54.851 --> 07:56.352
she'd tell me everything
is gonna be all right.

07:56.386 --> 07:57.653
And...

07:57.687 --> 07:59.187
Even if it wasn't.

07:59.222 --> 08:02.858
And now that she needs me,
I am always at work.

08:02.892 --> 08:04.726
And I'm--

08:04.760 --> 08:06.862
I'm so sorry.

08:06.896 --> 08:09.565
Yeah?

08:09.599 --> 08:12.067
Never answer your phone
in front of a client.

08:12.102 --> 08:14.136
- But it's you.
- What's happening?

08:14.170 --> 08:16.805
Well, actually we're
in the middle of a tea party.

08:16.840 --> 08:19.274
I knew you were
the doll-playing type.

08:19.309 --> 08:20.709
Put Joy on.

08:20.743 --> 08:22.477
Ms. McAfee,

08:22.512 --> 08:23.478
it's Harvey.

08:23.512 --> 08:25.347
Oh.

08:25.381 --> 08:26.581
Joy,
I'm sorry,

08:26.615 --> 08:28.349
I have to reschedule.

08:28.384 --> 08:29.751
No need to apologize.

08:29.785 --> 08:31.285
I like this one.

08:31.320 --> 08:34.288
I'll send him back after tea.

08:45.736 --> 08:48.171
Tell me you didn't ask
our client for a doggy bag.

08:48.205 --> 08:51.775
What can I say?
Stacy insisted.

08:51.809 --> 08:53.777
Just got off with
Joy McAfee's general counsel.

08:53.812 --> 08:55.746
It seems
she had an epiphany.

08:55.780 --> 08:58.782
She wants less on her plate,
not more.

08:58.816 --> 09:00.083
I thought you
were going to close her.

09:00.117 --> 09:02.252
We need that doll money.

09:02.286 --> 09:04.187
I'm on top of it.

09:04.221 --> 09:05.755
Harvey took five months
to structure that deal.

09:05.790 --> 09:08.324
Please don't make me set fire
to your desk.

09:08.358 --> 09:10.493
I--

09:10.527 --> 09:13.529
All you had to do
was have tea with the dolls.

09:13.563 --> 09:15.497
Donna, schedule another
tea party with Joy

09:15.532 --> 09:16.498
as soon as possible.

09:16.533 --> 09:17.967
And text me
the names of her girls.

09:18.001 --> 09:19.402
Oh,
what a shock.

09:19.436 --> 09:20.469
You can't keep girls' names
straight in your head.

09:20.504 --> 09:22.038
Just yours, Debbie.

09:22.072 --> 09:24.675
See, that's funny
because your name is Donna.

09:26.144 --> 09:27.111
Harvey Specter.

09:27.145 --> 09:29.614
I got your order
right here.

09:29.648 --> 09:30.882
I didn't order a pizza.

09:30.916 --> 09:32.951
You've been served.

09:36.822 --> 09:38.189
Cab driver who hit Ray

09:38.223 --> 09:40.124
named me as a witness
in a civil suit.

09:40.158 --> 09:41.792
I need to pay Travis Bickle
a visit.

09:41.826 --> 09:42.993
Harvey,
if you let me go talk to Joy,

09:43.027 --> 09:44.328
I know I can fix this--
- No.

09:44.362 --> 09:46.263
You don't send a puppy
to clean up its own mess.

09:46.297 --> 09:47.864
Optimally,
you don't even have a puppy.

09:56.006 --> 09:58.808
Ross, rumor has it you talked
a client out of $200 million.

09:58.842 --> 10:00.644
The deal's not off the table,
all right?

10:00.678 --> 10:02.045
It's just a speed bump.

10:02.079 --> 10:03.747
Dude, I think we just
found him a new nickname.

10:03.782 --> 10:06.083
Speed Bump!

10:06.117 --> 10:08.119
I feel like
I'm back in high school.

10:08.153 --> 10:09.821
They called you Speed Bump
in high school?

10:09.855 --> 10:11.322
Kidding.

10:11.357 --> 10:13.925
But if you need any boxes
to pack up your office, just--

10:13.960 --> 10:14.993
Ow.

10:15.027 --> 10:16.461
Hmm, wait a minute,
uh--

10:16.496 --> 10:17.563
There.

10:17.597 --> 10:18.864
I think that belongs to you.

10:18.898 --> 10:21.066
It wouldn't hurt so much
if you had thicker skin.

10:29.442 --> 10:31.577
What do you want?

10:31.611 --> 10:34.314
I wanna pay you back
for posting bail.

10:34.348 --> 10:36.082
Trevor, you've owed me
40 bucks since fifth grade.

10:36.116 --> 10:37.417
I wrote it off,
okay?

10:37.451 --> 10:39.486
Look, I want a clean slate,
okay?

10:39.520 --> 10:42.255
So you don't want to see me,
I'll mail you a check.

10:44.225 --> 10:46.394
Okay.

10:46.428 --> 10:48.896
Yeah, let's hang out
tomorrow night.

10:48.931 --> 10:50.031
Nothing crazy, though,
all right?

10:50.065 --> 10:51.032
I have to be up early.

10:51.067 --> 10:52.201
We can crochet panty hose

10:52.235 --> 10:53.669
if that's what it takes
to be cool.

10:53.703 --> 10:55.104
I think we can do
a little better than that.

10:55.138 --> 10:57.040
Why don't we, uh...

10:57.074 --> 10:58.941
Why don't we say Rex's,
7:30.

10:58.975 --> 11:00.509
First six rounds
are on me.

11:00.543 --> 11:02.077
If you're serious
about paying me back,

11:02.112 --> 11:03.912
the first 100 rounds
are on you.

11:03.946 --> 11:05.813
All right.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.167
So it's the tough guy.

11:28.803 --> 11:31.104
This is a matter
for insurance,

11:31.138 --> 11:32.572
not a frivolous lawsuit.

11:32.606 --> 11:33.873
You know,
for your information,

11:33.907 --> 11:35.141
I suffered emotional pain.

11:35.175 --> 11:37.311
Emotional pain?

11:37.345 --> 11:38.645
Rub this
on your emotional pain.

11:38.680 --> 11:41.882
You condescending
son of a--

11:41.917 --> 11:43.884
Look at me,
I am gonna warn you once.

11:43.919 --> 11:46.087
Do not pursue this matter.

11:46.121 --> 11:49.157
You know, I have been held up
at gunpoint three times.

11:49.191 --> 11:50.926
So do you think a fancy suit

11:50.960 --> 11:53.295
and a $500 haircut,
that's gonna scare me?

11:53.329 --> 11:55.931
You take my driver to court,
I'm gonna represent him myself.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.799
And when you lose,

11:57.834 --> 11:59.401
you'll be covering my fee,

11:59.435 --> 12:00.969
which is gonna be
a hell of a lot of haircuts.

12:01.003 --> 12:03.938
Hmm, so you weren't
a one-way fare.

12:03.973 --> 12:05.373
Ray's worked for me
eight years.

12:05.407 --> 12:07.274
Then you don't have to worry
about being a witness,

12:07.309 --> 12:08.476
because as his employer,

12:08.510 --> 12:11.078
you're liable
for his actions.

12:11.112 --> 12:12.679
You know,
I think you've seen

12:12.714 --> 12:14.981
way too many reruns
of <i>Ally McBeal.</i>

12:15.016 --> 12:18.319
Hmm. You know, I emigrated
here after September 11th,

12:18.353 --> 12:19.987
and they shut the doors
on everybody.

12:20.022 --> 12:23.425
I couldn't pay for a lawyer,
so I had to take them to court.

12:23.459 --> 12:25.193
I sued for my citizenship,

12:25.228 --> 12:28.163
so I have
a very special appreciation

12:28.198 --> 12:29.598
for the law.

12:29.633 --> 12:32.268
I appreciate
a good single malt.

12:32.302 --> 12:34.003
I don't pretend
I can make one.

12:34.037 --> 12:35.605
I wiped the floor

12:35.639 --> 12:38.741
with the U.S. government,
counselor.

12:38.775 --> 12:40.977
I'm gonna do
the same with you.

12:56.529 --> 12:58.657
- Ray.
- Donna.

12:58.658 --> 13:00.426
What are you doin' here?
I don't have you scheduled.

13:00.460 --> 13:02.261
Uh,
I need to see Harvey.

13:02.295 --> 13:03.462
Oh, come on.
You know the rules.

13:03.496 --> 13:05.196
No one sets foot in there
without a warrant,

13:05.231 --> 13:06.765
a papal edict,
or my say-so.

13:06.799 --> 13:07.765
I just got named

13:07.800 --> 13:09.133
in a multimillion-dollar
lawsuit.

13:09.167 --> 13:10.568
The accident
wasn't my fault.

13:10.602 --> 13:11.835
Can I get in to see Harvey,
please?

13:11.870 --> 13:13.804
Okay, say no more.
I will get you in.

13:13.838 --> 13:15.906
You are so beautiful
when you're forceful.

13:17.308 --> 13:18.809
I know you meant that
as a compliment,

13:18.843 --> 13:19.977
but I don't appreciate

13:20.011 --> 13:22.212
limitations
being placed on my beauty.

13:25.515 --> 13:26.482
Harvey,
I'm already losing money

13:26.516 --> 13:27.583
with my car in the shop.

13:27.617 --> 13:29.285
A trial means I can't work.

13:29.319 --> 13:30.486
And how do you think
my name is gonna play

13:30.521 --> 13:31.854
in front of a New York jury?

13:31.888 --> 13:33.389
Rahim Benghazi.

13:33.423 --> 13:35.291
I may as well buy
a one-way ticket to Guantanamo.

13:35.325 --> 13:37.392
- Not gonna happen.
- If I lose,

13:37.427 --> 13:39.227
I won't even be able
to afford a livery license,

13:39.262 --> 13:40.662
let alone my insurance.

13:40.696 --> 13:42.730
That's why I'm gonna be
defending both of us.

13:42.765 --> 13:45.533
Ray, this goes against
every fiber of my being.

13:45.567 --> 13:48.035
I'm taking your case pro bono.

13:49.137 --> 13:50.571
I don't know what to say.

13:50.605 --> 13:53.307
Absolutely nothing, I've got
a reputation to maintain.

13:53.341 --> 13:55.809
Besides,
it's not gonna take long, okay?

13:55.843 --> 13:57.844
I'm gonna
get it dismissed.

13:57.879 --> 13:59.947
Donna,
call the court.

13:59.981 --> 14:01.115
We need priority status
on the docket.

14:01.149 --> 14:03.284
Yeah,
I already tried.

14:03.318 --> 14:06.221
You drew Judge Palermo.

14:06.255 --> 14:07.322
You know what you have to do,
don't you?

14:07.356 --> 14:09.524
Yeah. The other thing
that goes against

14:09.559 --> 14:11.861
every fiber of my being.

14:11.895 --> 14:15.898
Louis, has anyone told you
you're an exquisite soprano?

14:15.932 --> 14:17.065
What do you want,
Harvey?

14:17.100 --> 14:19.868
You're right.
Why prolong my suffering?

14:19.902 --> 14:21.937
I need you to get me in
to see Judge Palermo.

14:23.439 --> 14:25.807
You need my help, and you're
not gonna pull rank on me?

14:31.646 --> 14:33.547
Your case has nothing to do
with firm business, does it?

14:33.581 --> 14:34.781
What's it gonna take?

14:34.815 --> 14:37.483
A mani-pedi?
Tickets to Celine?

14:37.518 --> 14:39.686
I'll see what I can do.

14:39.720 --> 14:41.788
And your pound of flesh?

14:41.823 --> 14:43.924
I need my back scratched,
I'll let you know.

14:43.959 --> 14:47.395
Louis, unless that's
a metaphor, the deal's off.

14:47.429 --> 14:48.396
Huh.

14:48.430 --> 14:50.598
Joy,
when I told you

14:50.632 --> 14:52.600
that my grandmother
didn't have much time,

14:52.635 --> 14:55.570
I--I didn't realize that
she's 15 years older than you.

14:55.604 --> 14:57.505
Now, how would you know
how old I am?

14:57.540 --> 14:59.440
That is
a very closely guarded secret.

14:59.475 --> 15:02.277
I did some research.

15:02.311 --> 15:04.145
Very resourceful.

15:04.180 --> 15:05.313
I did it
to assure myself

15:05.348 --> 15:07.049
that you can handle
a heavier workload.

15:07.083 --> 15:08.150
I appreciate that,

15:08.184 --> 15:09.919
but I'm not worried
about my health.

15:09.953 --> 15:11.053
Is it the money?

15:11.087 --> 15:13.589
Because I can guarantee,
200 million up front

15:13.623 --> 15:15.157
is just 1/10 of what you
stand to make on this deal.

15:15.191 --> 15:16.258
Michael,

15:16.292 --> 15:19.395
my dolls eat better
than most people.

15:19.429 --> 15:20.997
I've got plenty of money.

15:21.031 --> 15:23.099
This deal meant staying on
for five more years

15:23.133 --> 15:24.601
and doubling my workload.

15:28.339 --> 15:31.375
I am going to take
my grandchildren on a cruise

15:31.409 --> 15:33.644
to Tahiti.
Tahiti?

15:33.679 --> 15:35.914
You know,
the licensing agreement

15:35.948 --> 15:37.048
includes a theme park.

15:37.083 --> 15:38.483
You could--
you could take them there.

15:38.517 --> 15:41.119
It's not about the deal.

15:41.153 --> 15:44.388
I have had this same view
for 25 years.

15:44.423 --> 15:45.756
I need
a change of scenery.

15:45.790 --> 15:48.525
I am gonna speak to Harvey,
and I'm gonna tell him

15:48.559 --> 15:50.093
that I want to sell
the whole business.

15:53.230 --> 15:55.030
So...

15:55.065 --> 15:56.632
I just spoke
to Judge Palermo.

15:56.667 --> 15:58.300
And because he thinks
I'm a good guy,

15:58.335 --> 16:00.302
and I told him
I'd owe him one,

16:00.337 --> 16:04.140
your case is gonna be
moved up way ahead.

16:04.174 --> 16:05.308
Back scratch.

16:05.342 --> 16:06.575
I don't have a firstborn,
you know,

16:06.610 --> 16:07.877
so what exactly
do you want for that?

16:09.746 --> 16:11.347
No, you're not getting
one of my ties.

16:11.382 --> 16:12.382
No.

16:12.416 --> 16:14.685
Your shoulder?
What--

16:14.719 --> 16:17.487
your lapel--

16:17.522 --> 16:19.490
Donna?

16:19.524 --> 16:20.724
Oh, God.

16:20.758 --> 16:22.326
Norma is going to Istanbul
for two weeks,

16:22.360 --> 16:24.362
and you know
that I'm not good with temps.

16:24.396 --> 16:26.130
Oh, my God.
Ask me for something else.

16:26.165 --> 16:27.599
Harvey,
this is non-negotiable.

16:27.633 --> 16:28.867
You owe me now.

16:28.901 --> 16:30.902
Donna is one thing
that I can't give you.

16:30.936 --> 16:32.504
- Why not?
- For one thing,

16:32.538 --> 16:33.672
she'd never agree to it.

16:33.706 --> 16:34.739
You're her boss.

16:34.774 --> 16:35.873
You just tell her
to do stuff.

16:35.908 --> 16:37.075
I don't tell her
to do anything.

16:37.109 --> 16:38.076
She just does.

16:38.111 --> 16:39.110
All right, fine.
You know what?

16:39.145 --> 16:41.079
That's just...
Not a problem.

16:41.113 --> 16:42.113
I will call Judge Palermo,
and I'll tell him

16:42.147 --> 16:43.214
I was mistaken,

16:43.248 --> 16:45.283
and then your hearing
will be in,

16:45.317 --> 16:47.217
I don't know,
maybe six months?

16:47.252 --> 16:48.819
I tell you what.

16:48.853 --> 16:51.021
If you can convince her
yourself,

16:51.055 --> 16:52.055
you have my blessing.

16:52.089 --> 16:53.456
She's gonna love me
so much,

16:53.490 --> 16:54.524
you're gonna fight
to get her back.

17:00.998 --> 17:02.198
Hi, Donna.

17:02.232 --> 17:04.701
Harvey and I were just,
uh, talking about you.

17:04.734 --> 17:07.871
And--
- No.

17:07.906 --> 17:09.406
You don't even know
what I was gonna say.

17:09.441 --> 17:12.009
Yes, I do.

17:12.044 --> 17:13.377
And how is that possible?

17:13.412 --> 17:16.080
I read lips,
I know body language,

17:16.115 --> 17:17.148
and I talk to Norma.

17:21.354 --> 17:24.656
I'm not some token
you win at a fair, Louis.

17:24.691 --> 17:26.125
You're not--I know you're not.
You're not a token.

17:26.159 --> 17:27.126
I'm a human being,
and I--

17:27.160 --> 17:28.393
Yes, you are.

17:28.428 --> 17:29.628
I'm sorry,
I just--

17:31.431 --> 17:34.833
you know what,
that just made me feel really...

17:34.867 --> 17:36.468
Cheap.
I--

17:36.502 --> 17:38.270
No, I'm just trying to tell
you that you're really good

17:38.304 --> 17:40.405
at what you do, Donna.
So I'm gonna ask you--

17:40.439 --> 17:43.742
It's like
my soul hurts now.

17:43.776 --> 17:47.612
No, Donna, listen, even if
your soul hurts a little bit--

17:47.647 --> 17:48.980
I'm sorry.

17:49.015 --> 17:50.082
It's okay.

17:50.116 --> 17:52.084
It's gonna be fine.
Don't cry.

17:52.118 --> 17:53.085
Please don't cry,
Donna.

17:53.119 --> 17:54.653
Oh, sh--.

17:59.392 --> 18:00.826
I think I owe you one
for that.

18:00.860 --> 18:02.127
That was fun.

18:02.161 --> 18:06.231
Wait a second, the--
the time that you cried,

18:06.265 --> 18:08.634
and then I let your parents
stay in my condo--

18:08.668 --> 18:10.069
Yup.

18:17.144 --> 18:20.046
So you don't want
to talk about it?

18:20.080 --> 18:21.247
What is there
to talk about?

18:21.282 --> 18:23.350
I did exactly what my boss
told me not to do,

18:23.384 --> 18:25.018
and it blew up
in my face.

18:25.053 --> 18:27.722
Dude, I told you,
I'm taking care of this.

18:27.756 --> 18:29.423
In my last few hours
of employment,

18:29.458 --> 18:30.425
please, I should pay.

18:30.459 --> 18:32.093
All right,
put the wallet away.

18:32.128 --> 18:33.695
Oh.

18:33.729 --> 18:34.796
Wait--give--dude,

18:34.831 --> 18:36.698
this is epic.

18:36.732 --> 18:38.166
This is the scam
we always talked about.

18:39.635 --> 18:40.602
God, I bet you're
gettin' laid left and right.

18:40.636 --> 18:42.270
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:42.304 --> 18:43.671
You lose appreciation
after a while.

18:43.705 --> 18:44.772
Come on.
Yeah,

18:44.806 --> 18:45.773
why'd you put
a phone number on there?

18:45.807 --> 18:47.641
It's a real firm.

18:47.676 --> 18:49.810
Oh, yeah?

18:49.844 --> 18:50.811
Huh.

18:50.846 --> 18:52.046
What are you doing?

18:52.080 --> 18:54.014
Oh, I'm just calling
the employee directory.

18:54.048 --> 18:56.617
It's part of the scam,
man.

18:56.651 --> 18:57.785
- They'll check your story.
- Stop it.

18:57.819 --> 18:58.786
- What?
- Trevor, stop.

18:58.820 --> 18:59.787
Hang up the phone.
Oh, no.

18:59.821 --> 19:00.854
Trevor,
hang up the phone, stop!

19:00.889 --> 19:02.422
- What?
- All right? I'm working there.

19:02.457 --> 19:04.158
Oh, yeah.
What, as a lawyer?

19:05.994 --> 19:08.095
Are you--

19:08.129 --> 19:09.129
dude.

19:09.163 --> 19:10.297
It's a long story,
okay?

19:10.331 --> 19:12.799
But you can't tell anyone.
Ever. Okay?

19:12.834 --> 19:14.901
That is awesome!

19:14.936 --> 19:16.837
Man, I--
I always said

19:16.871 --> 19:17.837
that if you
quit smoking pot,

19:17.872 --> 19:19.005
you could do it.

19:19.039 --> 19:20.206
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:20.241 --> 19:21.207
Yeah, oh, that's right.
Yeah, you did.

19:21.241 --> 19:22.241
Right before you
passed me the bowl.

19:22.276 --> 19:24.210
Oh--

19:25.778 --> 19:27.346
What?

19:27.380 --> 19:29.314
Naw, I just--

19:29.349 --> 19:31.049
I wish you trusted me enough
to tell me.

19:32.184 --> 19:35.920
I mean, all I did was set you up
on a drug bust.

19:35.954 --> 19:37.221
Oh, God,
that was too soon.

19:37.255 --> 19:38.256
I'm sorry.

19:38.290 --> 19:41.159
Hi, ladies.
How are you?

19:41.193 --> 19:43.962
Um, I want to let you know,
if you--either of you

19:43.997 --> 19:45.898
ever get arrested
for anything,

19:45.933 --> 19:47.033
you call this guy.

19:47.067 --> 19:48.201
He's the best attorney
in the city.

19:48.235 --> 19:50.870
Well,
what would we get arrested for?

19:50.905 --> 19:52.773
- Um...
- I don't know.

19:52.807 --> 19:54.408
I don't know. What are you
thinking about doing?

20:01.549 --> 20:03.750
Uh,
as your attorney,

20:03.785 --> 20:06.086
I would definitely advise you
to do that.

20:08.155 --> 20:11.090
Uh, four more.
Yeah.

20:17.363 --> 20:20.298
I must warn you
that representing yourself

20:20.333 --> 20:21.933
at trial is not the--
- What's he doing here?

20:21.968 --> 20:23.568
You think you can schedule
a meeting without me knowing it?

20:23.602 --> 20:24.636
Oh, no.

20:24.670 --> 20:26.805
I'm privy to all communication

20:26.839 --> 20:28.340
between you and the court.

20:28.374 --> 20:30.142
Well, if your driving
matched your legal knowledge,

20:30.177 --> 20:31.177
we wouldn't be here.

20:31.211 --> 20:33.212
Your Honor.

20:33.246 --> 20:35.581
This case should be dismissed.
It's a matter for insurance.

20:35.616 --> 20:36.649
Insurance
only covers repairs.

20:36.683 --> 20:38.384
It does not deal
with my losses.

20:38.418 --> 20:40.620
What losses?

20:40.654 --> 20:42.889
Because of the accident,
I missed my chance

20:42.924 --> 20:44.158
to get my taxi medallion.

20:44.192 --> 20:46.326
You can't just buy it
next year?

20:46.361 --> 20:48.196
The loan I got
expires in one week.

20:48.230 --> 20:51.299
On top of that, a medallion
costs 300,000 this go-round.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.201
Next year, 350.

20:53.235 --> 20:55.403
So his entire claim
rests upon the assumption

20:55.438 --> 20:56.938
that he would've won
this year's medallion.

20:56.972 --> 20:58.205
The hallmark of America

20:58.240 --> 21:00.708
is that the little guy
gets to see justice done.

21:00.742 --> 21:02.343
We are all equals
in the eyes of the law.

21:02.378 --> 21:04.612
That is why, out of all
the countries in the world,

21:04.646 --> 21:06.714
I chose to come here.

21:06.748 --> 21:09.049
What do you got to say
about that, counselor?

21:09.083 --> 21:10.784
I say Atticus Finch
makes a good speech here,

21:10.818 --> 21:12.285
but this
is a fender-bender,

21:12.320 --> 21:13.953
not a multimillion-dollar
lawsuit.

21:13.988 --> 21:16.790
Vicarious liability
applies to discrimination,

21:16.824 --> 21:18.325
harassment,
and accidents.

21:18.359 --> 21:22.963
Employers are responsible
for their employees' negligence.

21:22.997 --> 21:24.364
Court finds
a reasonable suit here.

21:24.399 --> 21:25.666
Trial starts tomorrow.

21:26.701 --> 21:28.936
Thank you,
Your Honor.

21:30.939 --> 21:33.607
You're getting a good kick
out of this, aren't you?

21:33.642 --> 21:34.742
I am.

21:34.776 --> 21:36.977
But I'm taking this
on its merits.

21:37.011 --> 21:38.679
And you better bring
your "A" game tomorrow,

21:38.714 --> 21:40.314
'cause he's got
a legitimate claim.

21:40.348 --> 21:44.285
He wants a trial?
I'll give him a goddamn trial.

21:44.319 --> 21:46.153
Your Honor.

21:49.424 --> 21:51.992
So how many cases
have you won?

21:52.027 --> 21:54.995
I only remember
how many I've lost.

21:55.030 --> 21:56.297
None.

21:58.934 --> 22:00.234
Wait, what happened
to the drinks?

22:00.269 --> 22:01.436
I got a better idea.

22:01.470 --> 22:02.904
Let's say we get a bottle

22:02.938 --> 22:04.272
and take the party
back to your place?

22:04.306 --> 22:06.074
Make it a bottle of Dom,
and you're on.

22:06.108 --> 22:08.343
All right,
how about four bottles?

22:08.377 --> 22:10.845
Come on.

22:23.391 --> 22:24.591
You guys want
to get a cab?

22:24.626 --> 22:25.959
Definitely.

22:25.993 --> 22:28.161
Definitely.
Cab, four bottles of Dom.

22:28.195 --> 22:29.295
You want to spend any more
of my money?

22:29.330 --> 22:30.696
Just relax, okay?

22:30.731 --> 22:31.964
It's an investment
in the evening.

22:31.999 --> 22:34.467
And, uh, I just said the thing
about the bottles

22:34.501 --> 22:35.902
to get the girls
out of the bar.

22:35.936 --> 22:37.103
Really?
'Cause it looked like

22:37.137 --> 22:38.437
you were trying to get away
from those guys.

22:38.472 --> 22:39.906
Taxi!

22:39.941 --> 22:41.541
- What guys?
- The guys in the back.

22:41.576 --> 22:43.410
You know what I'm talking about.
Come on, who are they?

22:43.444 --> 22:45.079
What? Those two?
I--I--I don't know.

22:45.113 --> 22:46.547
Where are all the...Cabs?

22:46.582 --> 22:48.283
Well, it looked like
they knew you,

22:48.317 --> 22:49.818
and not in a very good way.

22:49.853 --> 22:51.387
I--I don't know.
Maybe they were, uh,

22:51.421 --> 22:52.788
flirting with our dates,
okay?

22:52.823 --> 22:53.990
I'd be pissed too

22:54.024 --> 22:55.391
if I watched those legs walk
away from me.

22:55.425 --> 22:56.492
How are we doin',
ladies?

22:56.527 --> 22:57.827
My feet are killing me
in these heels.

22:57.861 --> 22:58.962
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, Trevor, come on--

22:58.996 --> 22:59.962
- Taxi!
- Seriously,

22:59.997 --> 23:00.963
stop playing with me.

23:00.998 --> 23:02.298
What was that about
back there?

23:02.332 --> 23:04.401
Look, I'm not playing
with you, all right?

23:04.435 --> 23:05.902
But just
play your cards right,

23:05.937 --> 23:08.438
maybe you and, uh,
maybe Marcella will, uh,

23:08.473 --> 23:10.407
maybe she'll play with you.
Okay.

23:10.441 --> 23:11.808
Now, it's gonna be
a tight squeeze.

23:11.842 --> 23:12.876
Who wants to sit on my lap?

23:17.515 --> 23:19.449
Want to go after him?

23:19.484 --> 23:22.153
No, we're gonna get to him
through this guy.

24:02.343 --> 24:04.644
Ah-ha! Just like
the good old days, huh?

24:04.679 --> 24:05.779
Are you kidding me?

24:05.813 --> 24:07.947
This is way better
than the good old days.

24:07.981 --> 24:10.283
I--I'm actually
missing a shoe.

24:10.317 --> 24:12.218
Hey, where are we?

24:12.252 --> 24:14.320
Uh, I think
we're in Hoboken.

24:29.102 --> 24:30.335
You wanted to see me?

24:30.369 --> 24:32.737
Did you go see Joy
after I told you not to?

24:32.772 --> 24:34.639
How did you know?

24:36.910 --> 24:39.011
I didn't.
Until now.

24:39.045 --> 24:40.212
I told you,

24:40.246 --> 24:41.846
a puppy can't clean up
its own mess.

24:41.881 --> 24:44.182
Mess? All I did was tell her
about my grandmother.

24:44.216 --> 24:47.284
Your job
is to make my life easier.

24:47.319 --> 24:49.620
If you can't understand that,
why did I hire you?

24:51.823 --> 24:53.089
Police report summarized.

24:53.124 --> 24:55.559
Traffic signal analysis.

24:55.593 --> 24:58.662
Medallion bids,
attendees, and results.

24:58.697 --> 25:00.364
That's why you hired me.

25:00.399 --> 25:03.201
I thought you were all over
the Joy situation.

25:03.235 --> 25:06.038
Instead,
you're all over page six.

25:06.072 --> 25:08.374
You wanted me to do
pro bono work, this is it.

25:08.409 --> 25:10.910
Pro bono enhances
a firm's image.

25:10.945 --> 25:13.013
This makes us look
like wealthy bullies

25:13.047 --> 25:14.814
against an everyman cabbie.

25:14.849 --> 25:17.350
Does that seem like
it enhances our image to you?

25:17.384 --> 25:19.052
I refuse to answer that,
on the grounds

25:19.086 --> 25:20.253
that I don't want to.

25:23.490 --> 25:25.458
Someone had a fun night.

25:25.493 --> 25:29.062
Answer another call
you shouldn't have?

25:29.096 --> 25:30.897
I--I--
I didn't--I was--

25:30.931 --> 25:32.966
Piece of advice--
when the big dog asks the puppy

25:33.000 --> 25:35.502
something like that,
it's a rhetorical question.

25:35.536 --> 25:36.703
Got it.

25:36.737 --> 25:38.971
Before you go,

25:39.006 --> 25:40.506
the phone call, the other day,
when you answered it

25:40.541 --> 25:41.841
during the meeting...

25:41.875 --> 25:44.477
Yeah. Sorry about that.
Won't happen again.

25:44.511 --> 25:46.779
Who was it?

25:46.813 --> 25:49.649
Um, it's just a friend.
You know, an emergency.

25:49.683 --> 25:51.184
What kind of emergency?

25:51.218 --> 25:54.354
- Um--
- Was it a friend

25:54.388 --> 25:55.988
who almost got you busted
for drug trafficking?

25:56.023 --> 25:57.857
That friend?
Trevor?

25:57.891 --> 25:59.625
He's not dealing anymore,
Harvey.

25:59.659 --> 26:00.760
So it was him.

26:00.794 --> 26:02.395
He called you from jail?

26:04.797 --> 26:05.831
You know,
I make a living

26:05.865 --> 26:08.533
learning how to read people,
Mike.

26:08.567 --> 26:12.236
So if I saw it,
Jessica did too.

26:12.270 --> 26:15.805
Is that the kind of impression
you want to leave around here?

26:15.840 --> 26:17.607
This guy is not your friend.

26:17.641 --> 26:19.609
He is an anchor dragging
you down. Get rid of him.

26:19.643 --> 26:22.378
He is my oldest friend,
Harvey.

26:22.412 --> 26:23.712
I wasn't just gonna let
him rot in jail.

26:23.746 --> 26:25.280
What's gonna happen
the next time?

26:25.314 --> 26:27.048
'Cause there will be
a next time.

26:27.083 --> 26:29.450
You gonna bail him out?

26:29.485 --> 26:30.851
Put yourself in jeopardy?

26:30.886 --> 26:31.952
You know,
if it weren't for Trevor,

26:31.987 --> 26:34.622
you and I never would've met.

26:34.656 --> 26:36.490
Cut him loose.

26:40.962 --> 26:43.463
We're here
to see Mike Ross.

26:43.497 --> 26:45.031
He's an associate.

26:45.066 --> 26:46.366
His friend Trevor
referred us.

26:46.400 --> 26:48.768
Thank you.

26:48.802 --> 26:50.536
Hey.

26:52.339 --> 26:55.041
It looked like they knew you,
and not in a very good way.

27:40.391 --> 27:41.391
Hey!

27:43.795 --> 27:44.795
Hey!

27:54.774 --> 27:56.708
Excuse me,
officer.

27:56.742 --> 27:58.243
Is--
is Central Park that way?

27:58.277 --> 27:59.811
Yeah,
just go right there.

27:59.845 --> 28:02.113
Uh, I'm sorry, I'm--I'm--
I'm really terrible

28:02.147 --> 28:03.747
with direction.

28:03.782 --> 28:05.249
Is it this street,
right here?

28:05.283 --> 28:06.417
- Yeah, this street, yes.
- This street.

28:06.451 --> 28:07.418
Right here?

28:07.452 --> 28:08.452
- Yeah.
- Okay.

28:16.326 --> 28:19.362
Trevor, it's Mike.
Call me back.

28:19.396 --> 28:21.565
I need to know
what the hell's going on.

28:38.114 --> 28:40.405
Did you get
the red velvet cupcakes?

28:40.406 --> 28:42.540
Yes, three dozen,
extra icing.

28:43.809 --> 28:45.242
How the hell
did that happen?

28:45.277 --> 28:49.513
Okay.
You know what?

28:49.548 --> 28:52.082
There.
Problem solved.

28:52.117 --> 28:56.053
I asked you,
how'd you get that tear?

28:59.424 --> 29:02.727
A couple of guys
came to the firm.

29:02.761 --> 29:05.363
They were looking for me.

29:05.397 --> 29:07.899
I don't know what they wanted,
but I'm...

29:07.933 --> 29:10.235
I'm pretty sure it something
to do with some shit Trevor did.

29:10.269 --> 29:11.570
And that big brain of yours
doesn't remember

29:11.604 --> 29:12.738
me saying to cut ties
with that loser?

29:12.772 --> 29:13.905
You know what?

29:13.940 --> 29:15.007
You've been blowing off
Joy's deal

29:15.041 --> 29:16.542
all week for your friend, okay?
So please.

29:16.576 --> 29:19.078
First of all,
Trevor's not your friend.

29:19.112 --> 29:21.881
You want to know why
I'm loyal to Ray?

29:21.915 --> 29:24.516
I was taking a limo,
and I left $3,000 in it.

29:24.551 --> 29:26.619
Ray happened to be
the driver.

29:26.653 --> 29:28.788
He found it
and tracked me down.

29:28.822 --> 29:30.123
Not a nickel of it
was missing,

29:30.157 --> 29:32.525
and his first reaction
when this accident occurred

29:32.559 --> 29:34.093
was to ask
if we were okay.

29:34.127 --> 29:37.296
Now, what would Trevor's
have been?

29:37.330 --> 29:39.231
Cut him off.

29:39.266 --> 29:41.434
Now, as far as
the licensing deal goes,

29:41.468 --> 29:43.136
just because you think
I'm blowing something off

29:43.170 --> 29:44.537
doesn't mean I am.

29:44.572 --> 29:46.106
Now, watch and learn.

29:49.478 --> 29:51.646
Everything's set
for you to walk away.

29:51.680 --> 29:54.282
We're selling your stake
as a block.

29:54.316 --> 29:55.751
Your, uh, headhunter's

29:55.785 --> 29:58.020
lining up your replacement
as we speak.

29:58.054 --> 29:59.054
Well, Harvey,

29:59.088 --> 30:02.457
this was
the most wonderful surprise.

30:02.492 --> 30:06.128
You're a long-time client
who wants to be with her family.

30:06.163 --> 30:07.430
It's the least I could do.

30:07.464 --> 30:08.865
And you'll have
all the free time in the world

30:08.899 --> 30:10.833
to spend with them.
Joey broke the lamp.

30:10.867 --> 30:12.101
Oh, that's great.

30:12.136 --> 30:14.470
Now, how soon
can we send 'em home?

30:14.505 --> 30:16.005
They're booked
on the first flight out,

30:16.039 --> 30:18.007
tomorrow morning.

30:18.041 --> 30:20.810
So when you had Donna
text you the girls' names--

30:20.845 --> 30:21.945
I was talking
about her daughters.

30:21.979 --> 30:24.047
And you were gonna
fly them out all along.

30:24.081 --> 30:25.348
Do you remember
when I said,

30:25.383 --> 30:27.017
"You don't send a puppy
to clean up its own mess?"

30:27.051 --> 30:28.118
Yes, Harvey,
I do.

30:28.152 --> 30:31.822
I'm not a puppy.

30:31.856 --> 30:33.857
Court will come to order.

30:33.891 --> 30:35.692
Mr. Santana,
your opening statement, please.

30:35.726 --> 30:40.664
Driving a cab
is not very glamorous.

30:40.699 --> 30:43.200
But it's
an honest day's work.

30:43.235 --> 30:44.835
Ever since I started,
I looked forward to a time

30:44.870 --> 30:49.406
when I could tell customers
that they were riding in my cab.

30:49.441 --> 30:51.975
That I was
an owner-operator.

30:52.010 --> 30:54.545
So I scrimped,
and I saved,

30:54.579 --> 30:59.016
until I finally had enough
put away to buy a medallion.

30:59.050 --> 31:02.753
But...

31:02.787 --> 31:04.889
Because of the actions
of this man,

31:04.923 --> 31:07.792
I've lost that opportunity.

31:07.826 --> 31:10.195
So make no mistake,
this--

31:10.229 --> 31:12.297
this trial is not about
a busted headlight.

31:12.332 --> 31:15.067
This is a trial
about a broken dream.

31:15.101 --> 31:18.037
Forget the case, they're gonna
make him president.

31:18.071 --> 31:21.640
Statements
are like free throws--easy.

31:21.674 --> 31:23.875
Nobody's playing defense.

31:23.909 --> 31:26.410
Are we good at defense?

31:26.444 --> 31:27.611
You would agree

31:27.646 --> 31:30.447
that chauffeur drivers
cause more accidents--

31:30.481 --> 31:31.915
Objection.
Badgering.

31:31.949 --> 31:32.916
Sustained.

31:32.950 --> 31:34.050
Objection.
Argumentative.

31:34.085 --> 31:35.318
Leading the witness.

31:35.353 --> 31:36.553
Ambiguous.
Privileged.

31:36.587 --> 31:40.157
Inflammatory.
Sustained.

31:40.191 --> 31:41.892
Anything further,
Mr. Santana?

31:41.926 --> 31:43.794
Yes, Your Honor,
I would like to call

31:43.828 --> 31:46.130
to the stand
Mr. Michael Ross,

31:46.164 --> 31:48.365
please.

31:54.538 --> 31:55.638
Uh--

31:55.673 --> 31:57.673
What time had you called
for the limo

31:57.708 --> 31:58.774
on the morning
of the accident?

31:58.809 --> 32:00.242
Uh, we were supposed to leave
at 8:30.

32:00.277 --> 32:01.610
And what time
did you get to work?

32:01.644 --> 32:03.612
Objection.
Irrelevant.

32:03.646 --> 32:05.080
It's highly relevant,
Your Honor.

32:05.114 --> 32:07.582
It speaks to
the psychology of the driver,

32:07.617 --> 32:08.617
Rahim Benghazi.

32:08.651 --> 32:09.918
Overruled.

32:09.952 --> 32:12.186
Answer
Mr. Santana's question.

32:12.221 --> 32:14.155
8:40.

32:14.189 --> 32:15.356
So unless Mr. Benghazi

32:15.390 --> 32:17.524
made up
for that lost time,

32:17.559 --> 32:19.994
you were going to be late
for that meeting, correct?

32:25.502 --> 32:27.336
Yes.

32:27.370 --> 32:29.672
No further questions,
Your Honor.

32:33.244 --> 32:34.878
When the accident occurred,

32:34.912 --> 32:36.980
you were on your way
to the medallion auction.

32:37.015 --> 32:39.149
When and where was this auction
to take place?

32:39.183 --> 32:41.618
9:00 a.m., City Hall.

32:41.652 --> 32:42.686
According
to the police report,

32:42.720 --> 32:45.188
the accident occurred

32:45.223 --> 32:47.624
at 8:53 a.m.

32:47.658 --> 32:49.192
That means you only had
seven minutes

32:49.227 --> 32:50.894
to get downtown
in rush hour traffic.

32:50.928 --> 32:52.696
Objection,
irrelevant.

32:52.730 --> 32:54.898
I believe when
I made the same objection,

32:54.932 --> 32:56.532
you told his honor
it was highly relevant.

32:56.566 --> 32:57.700
Overruled.

32:59.670 --> 33:01.171
You were running late,

33:01.205 --> 33:02.806
only the stakes for you
were much higher,

33:02.840 --> 33:03.874
weren't they?

33:03.908 --> 33:05.709
These things
never start on time.

33:05.743 --> 33:07.611
Then why was
the first medallion

33:07.645 --> 33:09.213
sold at 9:03 a.m.?

33:09.247 --> 33:11.048
You were scared
your chance

33:11.082 --> 33:13.150
at a medallion
was going up in smoke,

33:13.185 --> 33:14.852
and you ran a red.

33:14.887 --> 33:17.756
Then you used the accident
to paint me

33:17.790 --> 33:19.892
and Ray Benghazi
as a couple of scapegoats.

33:19.926 --> 33:21.193
You can't prove that.

33:21.227 --> 33:22.194
What color was the light?

33:22.228 --> 33:23.762
I take the fifth.

33:23.797 --> 33:24.897
You can't take the fifth,
Mr. Santana.

33:24.931 --> 33:27.433
This isn't a criminal case.

33:27.467 --> 33:29.334
What color was the light?

33:29.369 --> 33:31.337
He cut me off.

33:31.371 --> 33:33.039
You claim to love
our legal system so much,

33:33.073 --> 33:34.240
answer the question.

33:34.274 --> 33:38.044
What color was the light?

33:38.078 --> 33:39.979
What color was the light?

33:42.249 --> 33:44.116
Your Honor?

33:44.150 --> 33:46.384
Answer the question,
Mr. Santana.

33:50.256 --> 33:55.392
It just meant
so much to me.

33:58.596 --> 34:00.129
Your Honor,

34:00.164 --> 34:03.366
can I sidebar
with opposing counsel?

34:05.335 --> 34:06.468
We can roll the dice
with the jury,

34:06.502 --> 34:08.670
but I'd rather settle.

34:08.704 --> 34:10.438
Well, how much
would I have to pay?

34:10.472 --> 34:11.772
Nothing.

34:11.806 --> 34:13.975
You take responsibility
for the accident,

34:14.009 --> 34:15.943
and your insurance company
makes Ray whole.

34:15.976 --> 34:16.976
In return,

34:17.011 --> 34:18.844
I waive my right
to collect legal fees.

34:23.116 --> 34:24.817
I don't know
what to say.

34:24.851 --> 34:27.284
Don't say anything.

34:27.320 --> 34:30.221
I've got
a reputation to maintain.

34:30.255 --> 34:32.590
That goes for you
too, judge.

34:46.803 --> 34:50.138
Damn it, Trevor.
I left you like five messages.

34:50.172 --> 34:51.340
Good to know your boy's
flaky with everyone.

34:51.373 --> 34:54.375
I was taking it personal.

34:58.814 --> 35:00.081
What do you want?

35:00.115 --> 35:02.817
Well, Trevor owes us $50,000
he's never paid,

35:02.852 --> 35:04.953
so you're gonna bail him out.
Listen,

35:04.987 --> 35:07.556
I don't have that kind of money,
okay? I can't.

35:07.590 --> 35:09.490
Well, if you're not down here
in an hour with it,

35:09.525 --> 35:11.058
we're gonna take it out
on Trevor.

35:11.093 --> 35:13.628
Tell him
where the money is.

35:13.662 --> 35:15.429
Whatever you do,
don't show up.

35:16.531 --> 35:17.832
Trevor!

35:17.866 --> 35:20.268
You have one hour.

35:20.303 --> 35:22.738
Hello?
Hello?

35:31.370 --> 35:32.370
What do you think
you're doing,

35:32.371 --> 35:33.766
leaving in the middle
of a trial?

35:34.010 --> 35:35.244
I got some things
to take care of.

35:35.278 --> 35:37.279
You mean someone
to take care of.

35:37.313 --> 35:38.747
You never cut Trevor off,
did you?

35:38.781 --> 35:41.016
No, I didn't.
My friend's in trouble,

35:41.050 --> 35:42.017
and I'm gonna help him.

35:42.051 --> 35:43.651
You know what?
This is what addicts do.

35:43.686 --> 35:46.420
The second they start
making progress, they screw up,

35:46.454 --> 35:47.655
because deep down they think
it's only a matter of time

35:47.689 --> 35:48.856
until they fail.

35:48.890 --> 35:50.257
They'd rather fall
from the third floor

35:50.291 --> 35:51.258
than the penthouse.

35:51.292 --> 35:52.859
Nothing you say
can stop me.

35:52.894 --> 35:54.528
Then tell me
what the hell's going on.

36:02.672 --> 36:04.373
He's clean.
No wires.

36:04.407 --> 36:05.507
Are you sure?

36:05.542 --> 36:06.676
Yeah, I'm sure.

36:06.710 --> 36:09.111
You remember what happened
with the guy.

36:09.146 --> 36:10.847
He was 300 pounds.

36:10.881 --> 36:13.217
Now, who'd you say
you were again?

36:13.251 --> 36:14.618
Trevor's lawyer.

36:14.652 --> 36:16.086
Trevor didn't mention
a lawyer.

36:16.120 --> 36:17.921
He doesn't know
he hired me.

36:17.955 --> 36:20.757
Come on.

36:22.393 --> 36:25.328
Open the briefcase.

36:30.035 --> 36:33.103
Where's the goddamn money?

36:33.137 --> 36:36.072
That photo
is a screen shot,

36:36.107 --> 36:37.907
taken from my firm's
security video.

36:37.941 --> 36:40.009
We know
what you look like.

36:40.044 --> 36:41.544
And if Mike Ross
doesn't hear from me

36:41.578 --> 36:43.580
in the next five minutes,
he's calling the police.

36:45.349 --> 36:48.652
No, man. You're not comin'
in here and threatenin' us.

36:48.686 --> 36:51.822
You're looking at kidnapping,
extortion, and drug-dealing,

36:51.856 --> 36:53.056
and the district attorney

36:53.091 --> 36:54.725
happens to be number three
on my speed dial.

36:54.759 --> 36:56.794
Well, if we're looking
at all that time,

36:56.828 --> 36:58.162
you might as well
add murder.

37:00.399 --> 37:01.966
I got a better idea.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.935
Retainer agreement.

37:03.969 --> 37:05.403
If you sign right here,

37:05.437 --> 37:07.706
you'll become
one of my clients.

37:07.740 --> 37:09.407
And I won't be able
to testify against you,

37:09.441 --> 37:10.508
even if I wanted to.

37:10.542 --> 37:13.344
What about the money?

37:13.378 --> 37:15.813
This envelope
contains $10,000.

37:15.848 --> 37:17.248
Consider it a down payment
on Trevor's debt.

37:17.282 --> 37:19.283
Only here's the thing,

37:19.318 --> 37:20.986
I don't do pro bono work.

37:21.020 --> 37:22.020
And my retainer agreement

37:22.054 --> 37:25.323
requires a down payment
of $10,000.

37:25.358 --> 37:28.361
Now, as your attorney,
my job is to give you advice.

37:28.395 --> 37:31.130
So here's the deal.

37:31.164 --> 37:34.500
Sign the agreement.

37:38.005 --> 37:40.373
I thought I said
not to come.

37:40.408 --> 37:43.109
Remember that 40 bucks
from the fifth grade you owe me?

37:43.143 --> 37:44.477
If you were dead,
how would I collect?

37:44.512 --> 37:47.380
Oh, man.

37:47.414 --> 37:49.415
I'm sorry, I just...

37:49.450 --> 37:51.918
Put you in trouble
just by hanging out with you.

37:51.952 --> 37:52.952
So why'd you do it?

37:52.986 --> 37:54.454
'Cause I'm a dick.

37:56.257 --> 37:58.125
Bet you didn't think
you'd have to save my ass

37:58.159 --> 37:59.960
so soon after
bailing me out.

37:59.994 --> 38:01.395
I wasn't the one
who saved you.

38:01.429 --> 38:03.530
Yeah. Well, as a friend,
the guy puts me to shame.

38:03.564 --> 38:05.899
Harvey's not my friend,
trust me.

38:05.934 --> 38:09.336
Well, he didn't put his ass
on the line because of me.

38:09.370 --> 38:11.872
Listen, I pled you down
to a misdemeanor--

38:11.907 --> 38:13.340
- Ugh.
- Drunk and disorderly.

38:13.375 --> 38:15.343
And I paid the fine.

38:15.377 --> 38:17.011
I think it might
be a good idea

38:17.045 --> 38:18.646
if you got out of town
for a while.

38:20.916 --> 38:22.083
Montana.

38:22.117 --> 38:23.885
Well, you said
you wanted a clean slate.

38:23.919 --> 38:25.886
I figured 20 hours on a bus
ought to do the trick.

38:25.921 --> 38:27.722
Oh, yeah,
it'll do me good.

38:27.756 --> 38:30.224
Wait.

38:33.595 --> 38:35.162
When I get back,

38:35.197 --> 38:36.564
you know who the first person
I'm gonna call is.

38:36.598 --> 38:39.166
Yeah. The one person you know
who'll answer.

38:59.021 --> 38:59.988
For you.

39:00.022 --> 39:01.222
What's this?

39:01.257 --> 39:03.391
I'm very happy
you took Ray on pro bono.

39:03.425 --> 39:06.294
You, on the other hand,
can afford our services.

39:06.328 --> 39:08.696
You want me to pay me
to represent me?

39:08.731 --> 39:10.598
Mm-hmm. Ten hours
at $1,000 an hour.

39:10.632 --> 39:12.667
Eh, yeah,
I'll let you do the math.

39:12.701 --> 39:13.935
You can't be serious.

39:13.969 --> 39:15.603
I'll tell you
what I am serious about.

39:15.638 --> 39:17.305
I hear you're finally
mentoring the kid.

39:17.340 --> 39:19.307
I don't know
what you're talkin' about.

39:19.341 --> 39:20.642
Really,
because I understand

39:20.676 --> 39:22.410
that you dropped
the puppy analogy on him,

39:22.445 --> 39:24.079
which is exactly
what I used on you.

39:24.113 --> 39:26.047
May have slipped out
by accident.

39:26.081 --> 39:27.916
Well, accident,
on purpose,

39:27.950 --> 39:29.718
the really important thing is,

39:29.752 --> 39:30.986
is that
I'm taller than you.

39:31.020 --> 39:33.122
Yeah.

39:43.468 --> 39:45.636
Yup,
you look much thinner in that.

39:45.671 --> 39:48.106
You planted that story,
be man enough to own it.

39:48.140 --> 39:50.142
I don't traffic
in the tabloids, Harvey.

39:50.176 --> 39:51.176
But I can see how
whoever planted this

39:51.211 --> 39:52.177
might find it amusing.

39:52.212 --> 39:54.846
You know,
the great Harvey Specter

39:54.881 --> 39:55.981
bullying
a humble cab driver.

39:56.015 --> 39:58.283
I mean,
it's a no-win situation, really.

39:58.318 --> 39:59.552
Well,
maybe you didn't hear.

39:59.586 --> 40:01.420
I won
the no-win situation.

40:01.455 --> 40:04.456
Did it ever occur to you

40:04.491 --> 40:05.524
that if you hadn't
done that to me,

40:05.558 --> 40:07.493
I actually would have
owed you one?

40:07.527 --> 40:09.561
Maybe if you didn't humiliate
me in front of the associates--

40:09.596 --> 40:10.963
Louis,

40:10.997 --> 40:14.366
for an average attorney,
100 million is a career case.

40:14.400 --> 40:17.535
If I'm mocking you, it means
I think you're above average.

40:21.974 --> 40:25.543
But stress balls?
You're making it too easy.

40:34.052 --> 40:37.388
You put Trevor on the bus
to the boondocks?

40:37.423 --> 40:39.123
Yeah.
Can I ask you a question?

40:39.158 --> 40:40.725
After all this,

40:40.760 --> 40:41.926
you really
think I'm still buying

40:41.960 --> 40:45.062
the Mr. I-don't-give-a-crap
thing?

40:45.097 --> 40:47.632
Joy sent a little token
of her appreciation.

40:47.666 --> 40:52.003
She got your hair
just right.

40:53.373 --> 40:54.773
Did she ever make
one of these for you?

40:54.807 --> 40:56.141
Not that you'll ever see.

41:02.882 --> 41:06.882
