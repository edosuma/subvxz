WEBVTT

00:05.005 --> 00:06.086
Previously, on Beyond...

00:06.087 --> 00:08.129
Our target is a young man
named Holden Matthews.

00:09.970 --> 00:11.181
Failing to bring him in

00:11.182 --> 00:13.013
puts our entire cause at risk.

00:14.135 --> 00:15.726
Apply pressure.

00:16.767 --> 00:18.098
What happened?

00:18.099 --> 00:19.349
His vitals started going haywire

00:19.350 --> 00:20.770
and he woke up.

00:20.771 --> 00:24.023
- Celeste.
- I saw the most beautiful light.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.196
It's gonna work!

00:26.647 --> 00:28.858
There's this support group.

00:28.859 --> 00:30.150
They're called Hollow Sky,

00:30.151 --> 00:32.112
for people who have
lost loved ones.

00:32.113 --> 00:34.534
If he's planning on cutting
the bullet out himself,

00:34.535 --> 00:36.707
he'll still need supplies.
Options are limited.

00:39.210 --> 00:40.330
Ow.

00:40.331 --> 00:42.122
At last.

00:42.123 --> 00:43.874
Just had to follow
the breadcrumbs.

00:48.719 --> 00:50.220
Mostly sunny skies today

00:50.221 --> 00:51.551
with brisk, easterly winds.

00:51.552 --> 00:52.883
Expect a high near 52.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.074

03:01.181 --> 03:02.933
Sleep well.

03:03.974 --> 03:06.767
We have a big day ahead of us.

03:17.368 --> 03:19.118
Where did you get this?

03:19.119 --> 03:20.620
From a...

03:20.621 --> 03:24.415
very hot, very unsuspecting
girl named Abby.

03:25.996 --> 03:27.747
She's part of a support group

03:27.748 --> 03:29.540
that may or may not
be a death cult.

03:32.713 --> 03:35.005
Holden drew an arch
that looked just like that.

03:37.888 --> 03:39.469
So...

03:39.470 --> 03:41.891
what does Holden have
to do with these people?

03:41.892 --> 03:43.223
Nothing.

03:44.345 --> 03:46.015
But you should stay
away from them.

03:46.016 --> 03:48.017
Stay away?

03:48.018 --> 03:49.730
So are these people dangerous?

03:50.941 --> 03:52.111
Where is Holden?

03:52.112 --> 03:53.403
I told you, I don't know.

03:53.404 --> 03:55.485
- Then who does?
- I don't know that either.

03:55.486 --> 03:57.026
You gotta have some idea.

03:57.027 --> 03:59.989
If I had any idea, I'd be
out there looking for him.

03:59.990 --> 04:01.160
I haven't seen him in days.

04:01.161 --> 04:02.992
I left him over
a dozen messages.

04:02.993 --> 04:04.073
He hasn't gotten back to me.

04:04.074 --> 04:05.994
It's like he just fell
off the face of the Earth.

04:12.673 --> 04:14.173
Dude, where the hell
have you been?

04:14.174 --> 04:15.835
- Willa? Who...
- Give me the phone.

04:15.836 --> 04:17.046
- Holden?
- Luke...

04:17.047 --> 04:19.088
- Put Willa on the phone.
- Wait. Who is this?

04:19.089 --> 04:20.089
It's Jeff McArdle.

04:20.089 --> 04:21.801
I need to talk to Willa now.

04:21.802 --> 04:24.183
What? Jeff?
Wait, where the hell...

04:24.184 --> 04:25.095
This is Willa.

04:25.096 --> 04:27.096
Why do you have Holden's phone?

04:27.097 --> 04:28.097
Look, something happened.

04:28.098 --> 04:30.189
The people who came after him,
they took him.

04:30.190 --> 04:32.602
He told me to call you
if anything happened.

04:32.603 --> 04:34.154
How far are you from Fort Reed?

08:30.340 --> 08:31.932
You're awake.

08:33.974 --> 08:35.394
Ha.

08:35.395 --> 08:38.057
Ha.

08:38.058 --> 08:40.139
I'm glad.

08:40.140 --> 08:42.812
Selfishly, I...

08:42.813 --> 08:44.143
could hardly wait to meet you,

08:44.144 --> 08:45.525
but I thought I'd let you rest.

08:47.107 --> 08:49.199
I see you found the kitchen.

08:50.110 --> 08:52.071
I hope you're not still hungry.

08:52.072 --> 08:54.033
How about a drink?
Can I get you something?

08:54.034 --> 08:55.205
Where am I?

08:57.117 --> 08:59.419
You're in my home.
You're my guest.

09:02.212 --> 09:03.462
I'm sorry.

09:03.463 --> 09:06.295
I've heard so much about you.

09:06.296 --> 09:08.467
I feel as if we already
know one another.

09:08.468 --> 09:10.470
Isaac Frost.

09:13.133 --> 09:17.226
You... you drugged me
and brought me here.

09:17.227 --> 09:19.178
You sent men with guns after me.

09:19.179 --> 09:20.520
Me and Charlie...

09:21.732 --> 09:23.392
What happened to her?

09:23.393 --> 09:24.775
You didn't...

09:26.236 --> 09:27.687
Of course not.

09:27.688 --> 09:29.779
Your friend is fine.
We were never going to...

09:29.780 --> 09:32.572
hurt her or you.

09:35.495 --> 09:38.157
I'll admit, this whole situation
could have been handled

09:38.158 --> 09:42.041
with a bit more decorum, but...

09:42.042 --> 09:43.703
I couldn't exactly knock
on your front door

09:43.704 --> 09:45.164
and ask your parents
for permission.

09:45.165 --> 09:46.756
Leave my family out of this.

09:46.757 --> 09:49.508
You won't ever have to worry
about that Holden, okay?

09:49.509 --> 09:52.972
I understand the
importance of family.

09:52.973 --> 09:54.974
But I think you'll find
what I have to show you

09:54.975 --> 09:56.555
to be worth the inconvenience.

09:56.556 --> 10:00.139
No, whatever you want
to show me, I'm not interested.

10:00.140 --> 10:01.812
I think you are interested.

10:04.024 --> 10:05.986
I think you've
been interested...

10:07.818 --> 10:10.070
from the moment you woke up
from your coma.

10:13.283 --> 10:15.234
You've been...

10:15.235 --> 10:19.870
blessed with a very
curious mind, Holden.

10:21.001 --> 10:23.543
And I want to show you
what it's capable of.

10:28.248 --> 10:30.089
What is this place?

10:30.090 --> 10:33.173
This place is many things
to many people.

10:35.385 --> 10:37.097
To some...

10:38.518 --> 10:41.061
it's a church.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.183
For those...

10:44.184 --> 10:48.898
seeking answers in the wake
of tragedy or doubt.

10:48.899 --> 10:53.613
It's a safe haven for those
who believe in the impossible.

10:57.157 --> 11:00.579
For me, this place
is a reminder that

11:00.580 --> 11:03.412
miracles don't simply happen.

11:03.413 --> 11:07.166
They're a product
of a limitless imagination

11:07.167 --> 11:10.420
and just a little bit of moxie.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.964
You don't believe me.

11:15.005 --> 11:17.176
That's all right.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.009
That's why you're here.

11:20.350 --> 11:22.512
Give me a few hours.

11:23.854 --> 11:25.975
That's all I ask.
And if...

11:25.976 --> 11:28.147
you still want to leave,
I'll have a car take you home

11:28.148 --> 11:30.149
and you'll never hear
from me again.

11:30.150 --> 11:32.071
But...

11:32.072 --> 11:35.986
you'd be missing out on
something truly extraordinary.

11:37.157 --> 11:40.911
And you'll... leave me
and my family alone?

11:42.122 --> 11:43.784
My word is my bond.

11:51.041 --> 11:52.592
One hour.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.256
Fantastic.

11:57.257 --> 11:58.968
You're making
a wise choice, Holden.

11:58.969 --> 12:01.220
But we need to get moving.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.053
There's a lot
I want to show you.

12:07.517 --> 12:10.440
I'm very excited you're here.

12:24.915 --> 12:27.126
Magnificent creatures,
aren't they?

12:27.127 --> 12:29.209
I prefer a car myself.

12:31.041 --> 12:33.002
Congratulations are in order.

12:33.003 --> 12:34.874
You performed better
than we could have hoped.

12:34.875 --> 12:37.136
But you didn't call me here
to congratulate me.

12:37.137 --> 12:39.929
You brought us Holden.
You won your triple crown.

12:39.930 --> 12:42.052
Now your services
are needed elsewhere.

12:43.723 --> 12:45.014
I can be useful here.

12:45.015 --> 12:47.056
You can be useful
insulating Hollow Sky

12:47.057 --> 12:48.808
from any and all
outside threats.

12:48.809 --> 12:51.440
And there's still one loose
thread that needs to be clipped.

12:51.441 --> 12:52.481
But Holden.

12:52.482 --> 12:54.854
No longer your responsibility
or your concern.

12:54.855 --> 12:56.775
Like Holden, you have
a very specific purpose

12:56.776 --> 12:58.068
within this organization.

13:00.200 --> 13:01.821
I want to speak to Frost.

13:01.822 --> 13:03.072
You can't.

13:03.073 --> 13:04.703
He's with Holden now.

13:04.704 --> 13:06.325
There's still some work
to be done with him.

13:06.326 --> 13:08.959
He still needs... convincing.

13:10.710 --> 13:13.542
So what,
I'm just a... janitor?

13:13.543 --> 13:15.295
No. Don't be silly.

13:16.676 --> 13:19.219
You're the best
janitor we've got.

13:20.050 --> 13:22.551
And boy, do we have
one hell of a mess.

13:22.552 --> 13:24.924
Charlie Singer.

13:24.925 --> 13:26.055
Find her.

13:26.056 --> 13:27.687
And then what?

13:28.688 --> 13:31.060
Well, if I had to tell you,

13:31.061 --> 13:32.812
you wouldn't be the best.

13:48.208 --> 13:49.368
I pay a butt-load of money

13:49.369 --> 13:51.411
so you can doodle for an hour?

13:53.874 --> 13:56.045
What is her function anyway?

13:56.046 --> 13:58.128
I mean, make sure
you don't eat paste?

14:01.511 --> 14:03.173
And a belly.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.229
It's not even on, is it?

14:14.024 --> 14:16.186
Did you hear a word I said?

14:26.116 --> 14:27.577
Excuse me?

14:44.214 --> 14:47.096
We've survived the same things.

14:47.097 --> 14:49.098
Has anyone stopped us yet?

14:49.099 --> 14:51.181
Things changed.

15:31.811 --> 15:33.722
He must have followed us
from the motel.

15:33.723 --> 15:35.264
The man in the yellow jacket.

15:35.265 --> 15:36.935
He works
for an organization called...

15:36.936 --> 15:38.187
Hollow Sky?

15:38.188 --> 15:41.110
I followed that rabbit hole
as far down as it goes.

15:41.111 --> 15:43.612
Every tax document,
financial statement,

15:43.613 --> 15:45.324
even articles of incorporation

15:45.325 --> 15:47.196
are without a physical address.

15:47.197 --> 15:50.699
Either they've got some
serious pull with the IRS,

15:50.700 --> 15:53.072
or we're chasing a ghost.

15:53.073 --> 15:54.995
I don't believe in ghosts.

15:56.206 --> 15:58.078
That, that's where
you draw the line.

16:00.040 --> 16:02.581
Everything I did
or didn't believe,

16:02.582 --> 16:05.214
that went out the window as soon
as my path crossed with Holden's.

16:05.215 --> 16:06.795
What do you mean?

16:06.796 --> 16:09.138
If Hollow Sky's masquerading
as a religious movement,

16:09.139 --> 16:10.010
then they have headquarters.

16:10.011 --> 16:13.223
Congregations need
somewhere to congregate.

16:14.354 --> 16:16.226
I know who can help.

16:18.228 --> 16:19.769
You like tomatoes?

16:21.101 --> 16:22.152
They're okay.

16:24.274 --> 16:26.235
Well, these tomatoes...

16:26.236 --> 16:28.198
aren't simply okay.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.112
They're flawless.

16:34.744 --> 16:37.616
They're also transgenic.

16:37.617 --> 16:39.118
You know what that means?

16:39.119 --> 16:40.879
- They're genetically modified.
- Bingo.

16:40.880 --> 16:44.423
We've engineered them to produce
isoflavones to increase nutrition.

16:44.424 --> 16:46.004
Let me know
when you modify pizza

16:46.005 --> 16:47.836
to not get all soggy
in the microwave.

16:47.837 --> 16:50.089
You don't sound very impressed.

16:50.090 --> 16:52.091
It's a tomato.

16:52.092 --> 16:55.934
I'm all for scientific progress
and the wonders of biotech.

16:55.935 --> 16:57.686
You brought me here
against my will

16:57.687 --> 17:00.600
to show me a bunch
of vegetables?

17:02.021 --> 17:03.903
They're fruit, actually.

17:05.275 --> 17:08.108
And no, that's not why
I brought you here.

17:09.608 --> 17:12.861
Science has allowed us
a far greater understanding

17:12.862 --> 17:15.364
of our physical world
than we ever thought possible.

17:15.365 --> 17:18.497
But why stop
at our physical world

17:18.498 --> 17:22.462
when we both know
there's so much more?

17:25.214 --> 17:27.506
Can't imagine
what it's like to...

17:27.507 --> 17:29.718
wake up to discover
you're missing

17:29.719 --> 17:31.431
12 years of your life.

17:41.641 --> 17:43.483
These people never woke up.

17:46.396 --> 17:49.319
These are the faces
of those we've loved and lost.

17:50.900 --> 17:52.151
By celebrating them in life,

17:52.152 --> 17:54.454
it brings us closer
to them in death.

17:58.198 --> 18:00.369
Michael here would have been
about the age you were

18:00.370 --> 18:02.161
when you...

18:02.162 --> 18:03.753
had your accident.

18:07.127 --> 18:08.467
How did he...

18:08.468 --> 18:10.259
He was riding his bike.

18:10.260 --> 18:13.302
Moving along at the precise
speed and trajectory

18:13.303 --> 18:16.136
to put him in the path
of a drunk driver.

18:19.269 --> 18:23.061
Michael's father, Barry,
has been with us

18:23.062 --> 18:24.524
since his son died.

18:25.855 --> 18:27.817
He was suicidal
when he found us.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.110
Here at Hollow Sky,
we've been helping him

18:32.111 --> 18:34.072
find meaning and purpose

18:34.073 --> 18:36.536
in light of what happened
to his son.

18:37.577 --> 18:39.498
We've given him hope.

18:39.499 --> 18:42.332
Hope for what?

18:43.703 --> 18:45.164
He can't bring his son back.

18:45.165 --> 18:46.955
He can't change the past.

18:46.956 --> 18:48.337
You're absolutely right.

18:48.338 --> 18:51.961
But what if we could give Barry
the chance to see his son again?

18:57.096 --> 19:00.179
What if there was another way...

19:00.180 --> 19:04.223
to bring us closer
to those we've lost?

19:04.224 --> 19:08.318
To follow them out of
this world into the next?

19:12.192 --> 19:14.193
Since the birth of religion,

19:14.194 --> 19:17.156
the afterlife has been
a question of faith.

19:18.278 --> 19:20.409
Here, we believe
it's a question of science.

19:20.410 --> 19:22.871
We believe God
is just a placeholder.

19:22.872 --> 19:24.743
You're talking
about the afterlife

19:24.744 --> 19:27.165
like it's...
a destination.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.166
Exactly.

19:30.129 --> 19:32.130
And the world is...

19:32.131 --> 19:34.794
looking for someone
to show them the way.

19:37.597 --> 19:39.928
And you think I'm that someone.

19:39.929 --> 19:41.601
I do.

19:43.563 --> 19:45.805
How is that even possible?

19:47.517 --> 19:49.068
I'll show you.

20:04.624 --> 20:06.415
Diane.

20:06.416 --> 20:08.628
What's Hollow Sky?

20:11.000 --> 20:12.461
You mind grabbing me a towel?

20:12.462 --> 20:14.504
Will you answer my question?

20:17.176 --> 20:19.217
It's one of many generous donors

20:19.218 --> 20:21.390
who support Helping Hands.

20:21.391 --> 20:23.101
How generous?

20:23.102 --> 20:25.304
Where is this coming from?

20:25.305 --> 20:29.308
It's just that I've been
coming to church for six years

20:29.309 --> 20:31.560
and I've volunteered
at Helping Hands for three,

20:31.561 --> 20:33.772
and I have never heard
you say a word

20:33.773 --> 20:35.233
about this Hollow Sky.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.486
Well, they like to keep
the focus on the charity.

20:37.487 --> 20:39.067
Have they ever asked
about Holden?

20:39.068 --> 20:41.820
Diane, no.

20:41.821 --> 20:44.993
It's a shared belief system
that provides people

20:44.994 --> 20:47.036
with hope and comfort
who need it the most.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.459
When your boy was lying
in that hospital bed,

20:50.460 --> 20:52.130
that's what you needed too.

20:52.131 --> 20:54.873
I came to church.

20:54.874 --> 20:58.587
And you helped me find God.

20:58.588 --> 21:01.140
I didn't seek out
a fringe group.

21:03.182 --> 21:05.345
Tom was right.

21:06.726 --> 21:09.058
You've been talking to Tom.

21:17.066 --> 21:19.948
Hollow Sky gives people hope.

21:19.949 --> 21:21.860
There are plenty
of others out there

21:21.861 --> 21:23.742
who want to believe
in something more.

21:23.743 --> 21:27.496
And they want to believe
that tragedy is just temporary.

21:27.497 --> 21:32.120
And they want to ask what if
death is just the beginning.

21:32.121 --> 21:34.673
- Most religions ask that.
- Yes.

21:34.674 --> 21:38.047
But Hollow Sky has the answer.

21:39.679 --> 21:41.720
If Hollow Sky has Holden,

21:41.721 --> 21:43.131
it could undo everything.

21:43.132 --> 21:46.134
Please, tell me how
to find Hollow Sky.

21:46.135 --> 21:49.137
No. I won't put you at risk.

21:49.138 --> 21:51.850
First Celeste, then Holden.

21:51.851 --> 21:53.061
I won't lose you too.

21:53.062 --> 21:54.854
There's always been risk.

21:56.235 --> 21:57.607
Why are you giving up now?

22:03.242 --> 22:05.204
You're not afraid of losing me.

22:06.285 --> 22:08.036
You're afraid of losing.

22:08.037 --> 22:10.039
To Frost.

22:11.080 --> 22:13.793
It's always been
about you and Frost.

22:15.164 --> 22:16.455
Your rivalry,

22:16.456 --> 22:18.957
your race to reach
the afterlife.

22:18.958 --> 22:21.049
And now when it looks
like he'll succeed,

22:21.050 --> 22:22.341
you're prepared to just give up.

22:23.513 --> 22:24.923
Well, I won't give up.

22:24.924 --> 22:26.845
Not while he has Holden.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.927
And just how do you plan
to get him back?

22:28.928 --> 22:30.849
You're gonna walk up to Frost

22:30.850 --> 22:33.021
and kindly ask him
to let Holden go?

22:33.022 --> 22:35.103
Oh, it won't be kind.

22:35.104 --> 22:36.935
He holds nothing sacred.

22:36.936 --> 22:38.397
Not even family!

22:38.398 --> 22:39.978
Your mother found that out

22:39.979 --> 22:42.280
when he pushed
his experiment too far.

22:42.281 --> 22:44.694
She paid a heavy price
for his madness.

22:46.155 --> 22:48.117
I'm not about to pay
a heavy price for yours.

22:55.755 --> 22:57.457
Willa.

22:58.498 --> 22:59.548
These are coordinates.

22:59.549 --> 23:01.169
You'll see a dirt path
off the main road.

23:01.170 --> 23:03.132
Follow that up to the gate.

23:04.173 --> 23:05.555
And be careful.

23:09.308 --> 23:11.269
The girl in the photo.

23:11.270 --> 23:13.351
Who was she?

23:13.352 --> 23:16.104
A woman I loved severely.

23:16.105 --> 23:18.227
I spent years looking for her.

23:22.231 --> 23:24.734
In a place I believe
you're quite familiar with.

23:53.513 --> 23:56.145
For years, I've sent people in.

23:57.226 --> 24:01.650
Willing participants in what
someday will be considered...

24:01.651 --> 24:04.983
the greatest scientific
and religious expedition

24:04.984 --> 24:06.195
in human history.

24:08.447 --> 24:11.119
Those who ventured far enough

24:11.120 --> 24:13.572
glimpse what they describe

24:13.573 --> 24:16.786
as a spectacular sea of light.

24:18.958 --> 24:22.290
And an archway...

24:22.291 --> 24:25.584
like a grand entrance
leading out...

24:25.585 --> 24:28.216
into the great beyond.

24:28.217 --> 24:31.180
A bridge to the afterlife.

24:35.645 --> 24:38.477
Now you and I can take
that next step together.

24:46.816 --> 24:48.317
Why me?

24:49.488 --> 24:50.869
You said you sent others in.

24:50.870 --> 24:52.490
They all came back damaged.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.412
But not you.

24:54.413 --> 24:57.576
Haven't you ever wondered
why you were able to survive

24:57.577 --> 25:00.039
so long in that coma
with no ill effect?

25:02.622 --> 25:06.795
That place you spent
those 12 years...

25:06.796 --> 25:08.126
it kept you alive.

25:08.127 --> 25:11.009
Kept me alive?
The Realm almost killed me.

25:11.010 --> 25:12.130
But it didn't.

25:12.131 --> 25:17.015
The Realm is how you are able
to manipulate your environment

25:17.016 --> 25:18.977
both in that world and this one.

25:18.978 --> 25:21.310
It's this connection

25:23.022 --> 25:26.565
that will allow us
to cross that bridge...

25:26.566 --> 25:27.817
into the light.

25:29.819 --> 25:33.031
In order to lead
the Israelites to freedom,

25:33.032 --> 25:35.705
Moses had to part the Red Sea.

25:37.036 --> 25:40.079
I can't make this journey
on my own, Holden.

25:41.080 --> 25:43.372
What I need from you
is a miracle.

25:49.719 --> 25:51.590
- They're not Army.
- Mercenary maybe.

25:51.591 --> 25:53.301
Looks like they hired

25:53.302 --> 25:55.343
a private company
to keep people out.

25:55.344 --> 25:57.136
Or keep people in.

26:03.482 --> 26:04.733
What are you doing?

26:04.734 --> 26:06.314
Give me 20 minutes
to run a perimeter sweep.

26:06.315 --> 26:09.067
Stay here. Don't make a
move until I figure out

26:09.068 --> 26:11.780
just what the hell
we're walking into.

26:11.781 --> 26:12.952
Wait.

26:19.118 --> 26:20.369
It's less noisy than a gun.

26:31.050 --> 26:34.093
Was I supposed
to bring a weapon?

26:41.560 --> 26:43.062
Tomato soup.

26:47.687 --> 26:52.441
There is often great beauty
in simplicity.

26:54.323 --> 26:56.194
"Make everything

26:56.195 --> 26:58.947
as simple as possible,
but not simpler."

26:58.948 --> 27:01.499
Einstein said that.

27:01.500 --> 27:03.162
I know.

27:07.126 --> 27:09.748
It shouldn't
surprise you that...

27:09.749 --> 27:12.210
every single ingredient
in this soup is

27:12.211 --> 27:14.462
the product of years
of research,

27:14.463 --> 27:17.175
taste testing,
genetic modification,

27:17.176 --> 27:20.889
to deliver the most
extraordinary texture

27:20.890 --> 27:24.143
and flavor profile.

27:31.861 --> 27:33.071
Mm.

27:33.072 --> 27:34.323
Hmph.

27:36.986 --> 27:39.078
Go on. It's not poison.

27:40.279 --> 27:42.241
I'm not gonna turn
into a blueberry, am I?

28:07.767 --> 28:10.980
What is cooking
but basic chemistry?

28:12.902 --> 28:14.272
But you're...

28:14.273 --> 28:17.446
more of an astronomy
buff, am I right?

28:19.028 --> 28:20.909
You're a dreamer.

28:20.910 --> 28:22.871
I bet you look up at the stars

28:22.872 --> 28:25.413
at night and think,

28:25.414 --> 28:28.496
"My God, this is a big universe.

28:28.497 --> 28:31.129
"What else is out there?

28:31.130 --> 28:34.003
What else am I missing?"

28:36.926 --> 28:39.218
Well, now that you know...

28:41.891 --> 28:44.263
I guess the question is...

28:45.724 --> 28:47.937
what are you going to do?

28:49.769 --> 28:51.690
Um...

28:53.562 --> 28:55.985
- Mr. Frost...
- "Isaac."

28:57.777 --> 28:59.198
Isaac.

29:00.990 --> 29:02.781
I think you've got
the wrong idea.

29:02.782 --> 29:04.363
How so?

29:06.575 --> 29:08.456
You're right.

29:08.457 --> 29:10.539
I've seen what's out there.

29:12.081 --> 29:14.712
But the Realm is violent.

29:14.713 --> 29:19.337
It's unrelenting
and it doesn't want us there.

29:19.338 --> 29:23.181
I spent all
those years surviving.

29:23.182 --> 29:25.184
I'm not going
through that again.

29:26.976 --> 29:29.688
Certainly not for you.

29:45.454 --> 29:47.615
We can't wait any longer.

29:47.616 --> 29:49.168
I'm going in.

29:50.619 --> 29:52.179
Wait. We'll never
make it past the gate.

29:56.585 --> 29:58.586
Take me to Frost.

29:58.587 --> 30:00.088
And who the hell are you?

30:00.089 --> 30:02.130
I'm his daughter.

30:02.131 --> 30:04.183
And who is he?

30:06.185 --> 30:07.475
Uh...

30:07.476 --> 30:09.598
I'm his son.

30:12.271 --> 30:13.933
So that's it?

30:15.144 --> 30:16.144
I can go?

30:17.816 --> 30:20.569
I'll have a car brought up to the
house that'll take you home.

30:24.323 --> 30:26.825
But first, I want to
know one thing.

30:31.410 --> 30:33.411
What do I tell
all those people out there

30:33.412 --> 30:34.753
who have been praying...

30:38.337 --> 30:40.088
waiting for the chance

30:40.089 --> 30:43.721
to reconnect with their
lost loved ones?

30:43.722 --> 30:45.554
Do I tell them, "Sorry."

30:47.226 --> 30:49.177
"You're never going to see
your child, your mother,

30:49.178 --> 30:50.598
"or your father ever again

30:50.599 --> 30:55.184
because Holden Matthews wants
to lead a normal life"?

30:56.855 --> 31:00.029
Or would you like
to tell them that?

31:01.110 --> 31:04.482
Tell them whatever you want.

31:04.483 --> 31:05.864
You and I are done.

31:09.448 --> 31:13.202
You're so selfish.

31:15.664 --> 31:17.625
You and you alone have the power

31:17.626 --> 31:20.458
to improve the lives
of so many people

31:20.459 --> 31:22.710
and the only life
you're concerned with

31:22.711 --> 31:24.053
is your own?

31:26.805 --> 31:28.466
You even lost...

31:28.467 --> 31:31.269
your friend Kevin, was it?

31:31.270 --> 31:34.773
You've got Kevin's blood
on your hands...

31:36.395 --> 31:38.607
and you don't even want
the chance to apologize.

31:49.488 --> 31:51.869
If you feel a light tickle
at the back of your throat,

31:51.870 --> 31:54.792
that's just the neuroinhibitor,

31:54.793 --> 31:58.036
modified to keep
your outbursts under control.

31:58.037 --> 32:02.631
But at least it won't turn
you into a blueberry.

32:11.220 --> 32:14.262
You lied to me this whole time.

32:14.263 --> 32:15.724
A simple misunderstanding.

32:17.516 --> 32:19.477
But now I'll be clear.

32:19.478 --> 32:21.649
You're going to get
into that machine

32:21.650 --> 32:23.290
and you're going to
take me to the bridge.

32:24.653 --> 32:26.235
One way or another.

32:42.291 --> 32:44.343
Son of a...

32:52.851 --> 32:55.973
Your guest has attracted
some unwanted attention,

32:55.974 --> 32:57.645
but it's contained.

32:57.646 --> 33:00.268
How contained?

33:00.269 --> 33:03.061
I put one of them
in your office.

33:03.062 --> 33:04.653
My office? Why?

33:05.864 --> 33:07.446
She says her name is Willa.

33:12.701 --> 33:14.203
No! Please!

33:15.704 --> 33:17.116
Holden?

33:18.247 --> 33:19.997
Luke? What...

33:19.998 --> 33:23.211
what are you...
What are you doing here?

33:23.212 --> 33:24.462
Dude, would you believe
rescuing you?

33:24.463 --> 33:26.254
- You're here on your own?
- Uh, well...

33:26.255 --> 33:27.965
- Mom and Dad.
- No, no.

33:27.966 --> 33:30.128
Definitely not.
It's Willa and Jeff.

33:30.129 --> 33:32.220
With Willa?
You came here with Willa?

33:32.221 --> 33:33.721
- She came by the house.
- Where is she?

33:33.722 --> 33:35.093
- I... I don't know.
- And Jeff?

33:35.094 --> 33:37.515
- I...
- Did you guys at least have a plan?

33:37.516 --> 33:40.228
You know, I knew
we were forgetting something.

33:40.229 --> 33:41.350
You shouldn't have come.

33:43.192 --> 33:45.022
Okay, what choice did we have?

33:45.023 --> 33:47.145
Okay, you've been
acting like a crazy person

33:47.146 --> 33:48.197
ever since you woke up.

33:49.698 --> 33:52.070
You come to my school
with blood on your shirt,

33:52.071 --> 33:54.243
you run off
with this Charlie girl.

33:55.454 --> 33:57.034
Yeah, I'm your brother!

33:57.035 --> 33:58.996
In coma or no coma!

33:58.997 --> 34:01.660
Whatever it is you're going
through, we go through it together!

34:03.001 --> 34:04.663
I'm begging.
You gotta let me in.

34:06.085 --> 34:08.045
There's...

34:08.045 --> 34:10.088
It's a lot to explain.

34:10.089 --> 34:11.929
Okay? But I promise
when we get home,

34:11.929 --> 34:13.091
I'll explain everything.

34:13.092 --> 34:15.723
Right now, we need to
get Willa and get out.

34:15.724 --> 34:17.175
- Okay?
- Okay.

34:17.176 --> 34:19.097
- Just look for something.
- Okay.

34:19.098 --> 34:20.889
Yeah, yeah.

34:25.143 --> 34:28.106
What, you're used to sneaking
in and out of rooms, right?

34:28.107 --> 34:31.109
I kind of think I'm missing
the life and death urgency

34:31.110 --> 34:33.322
of having some girl's dad
walk in on us.

34:34.693 --> 34:36.784
Besides, you're
the science nerd.

34:36.784 --> 34:38.576
Can't you just...

34:38.577 --> 34:40.908
you know, science
your way out of here?

34:40.909 --> 34:42.120
Science our way out of here?

34:42.121 --> 34:44.001
You know, like when
you supercharged our toaster

34:44.002 --> 34:46.123
because you couldn't wait
10 minutes for Bagel Bites?

34:46.125 --> 34:48.005
Well, you remember that.
You cut off power

34:48.005 --> 34:49.418
for the entire block.

34:52.761 --> 34:54.052
What? What is it?

34:56.094 --> 34:58.347
I'm gonna science
our way out of here.

35:21.200 --> 35:22.701
Hi, Dad.

35:30.379 --> 35:31.839
Willa.

35:31.840 --> 35:34.012
I'm surprised
you remembered my name...

35:35.714 --> 35:37.135
or did she have to remind you?

35:52.030 --> 35:54.273
You look just like her.

35:58.657 --> 36:01.118
Celeste.

36:01.119 --> 36:02.871
So I've heard.

36:04.082 --> 36:06.334
So...

36:06.335 --> 36:10.628
why now, after all these years?

36:10.629 --> 36:13.551
- You have something I want.
- If it's an apology,

36:13.552 --> 36:15.172
I'm afraid you're going
to be disappointed.

36:15.173 --> 36:17.004
I found out you're my father.

36:17.005 --> 36:18.886
I'm used to disappointment.

36:18.887 --> 36:19.927
You have to understand

36:19.928 --> 36:22.009
that what I did was
the best thing for both of us.

36:22.010 --> 36:23.601
You got to live your life.

36:23.602 --> 36:25.513
And I want to continue
living my life

36:25.514 --> 36:28.015
without you in it.

36:28.016 --> 36:30.107
I'll leave here.

36:30.108 --> 36:32.860
You'll never see me
or hear me again.

36:32.861 --> 36:35.073
But?

36:35.984 --> 36:38.277
But I'm leaving here
with Holden.

36:41.240 --> 36:43.492
And why would you want Holden?

36:55.424 --> 36:56.755
Hmph.

36:59.598 --> 37:02.099
I've been searching for him
for a very long time.

37:02.100 --> 37:05.473
You probably know I've got
a lot riding on him.

37:05.474 --> 37:08.106
I just can't
give him up for nothing.

37:09.268 --> 37:10.648
You owe me.

37:10.649 --> 37:12.310
I owe you?

37:12.311 --> 37:14.613
Killed my mother.

37:21.320 --> 37:24.201
Tell me, how exactly do you...

37:24.202 --> 37:27.164
think your mother
wound up in a coma?

37:27.165 --> 37:29.458
What do you think
put her in that state?

37:32.130 --> 37:33.792
It was you.

37:37.085 --> 37:39.637
You were born.

37:39.638 --> 37:42.010
And I lost the woman I love.

37:43.512 --> 37:46.645
I owe you nothing.

37:56.064 --> 37:59.067
You want Holden to get you
to the Ocean of Light.

38:01.660 --> 38:05.072
Well...

38:05.073 --> 38:07.866
I'm the one who showed him
how to get there.

38:09.458 --> 38:12.000
Arthur raised me to be
more than his granddaughter.

38:13.412 --> 38:15.673
We got to Holden first.

38:15.674 --> 38:17.966
We were in the Realm with him.

38:19.257 --> 38:20.588
Been there too.

38:20.589 --> 38:22.050
I can take you
where you want to go.

38:24.513 --> 38:26.053
Why should I trust you?

38:26.054 --> 38:28.266
What makes you think
you can trust Holden?

38:29.688 --> 38:31.350
You've seen what he can do.

38:33.061 --> 38:34.732
So what makes
you think you're safer

38:34.733 --> 38:36.645
having him lead you?

38:38.397 --> 38:40.917
What makes you think he won't kill
you the first chance he gets?

38:42.150 --> 38:44.402
Holden's not a killer.

38:44.403 --> 38:47.366
Takes one to know one, I guess.

38:48.997 --> 38:51.829
Then I'd choose
my next words carefully.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.502
You're not hearing me.

38:54.753 --> 38:57.165
Let Holden go and I'll take you.

38:58.507 --> 39:00.918
You want to reach
the Ocean of Light?

39:00.919 --> 39:03.131
I'm the only chance you've got.

39:11.520 --> 39:14.311
We can use an electrical charge
to short-circuit that door lock.

39:14.312 --> 39:16.103
Put that end into the wall

39:16.104 --> 39:17.475
and the current should
give us enough to...

39:17.476 --> 39:19.067
Yeah, bitch!

39:20.318 --> 39:22.860
You know? 'Cause you're
like Walter White and I'm...

39:22.861 --> 39:24.242
I'm like Jesse.

39:25.744 --> 39:27.325
Man, you're in for such a treat.

39:29.117 --> 39:30.288
Okay, and...

39:31.580 --> 39:32.910
there.

39:32.911 --> 39:35.413
- Yes.
- All right.

39:35.414 --> 39:36.994
Whoa, hey, what...
What are you doing?

39:36.995 --> 39:38.375
I'll do the honors.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.087
- No, no, you won't.
- Yeah.

39:40.088 --> 39:41.549
Come on.

39:41.550 --> 39:44.422
Okay, hospitals don't give
points for repeated visits.

39:44.423 --> 39:45.764
Now hand it over.

39:47.596 --> 39:48.927
Hide.

39:53.311 --> 39:54.682
Frost wants to talk.

39:54.683 --> 39:56.605
What's stopping him?

39:59.067 --> 40:00.277
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

40:00.278 --> 40:01.860
Okay! Okay!

40:02.981 --> 40:06.154
Luke, remember,
just like Wilson White.

40:08.657 --> 40:10.028
"Wilson?"

40:26.715 --> 40:28.385
Where is she?

40:28.386 --> 40:29.677
Where's Willa?

40:29.678 --> 40:31.469
She's safe.

40:31.470 --> 40:34.012
Let her and my brother go.

40:35.263 --> 40:36.895
I'll give you what you want.

40:38.056 --> 40:39.687
Sorry.

40:39.688 --> 40:41.398
You can't walk away
from the table

40:41.399 --> 40:43.361
and come back
expecting the same terms.

40:47.566 --> 40:49.618
Take me to Willa.

40:52.200 --> 40:53.200
Willa!

40:55.704 --> 40:57.075
Willa!

40:59.998 --> 41:01.418
Get her out.

41:01.419 --> 41:04.171
It's too late.

41:04.172 --> 41:07.045
She volunteered
to take your place.

41:13.141 --> 41:15.263
She must like you a lot.

41:17.516 --> 41:21.059
Now the only question is what
are you willing to do for her?

41:35.243 --> 41:38.245
26 years ago, I lost the
only woman I ever loved.

41:38.246 --> 41:41.709
Before she left,
she gave me a message.

41:41.710 --> 41:43.171
She's in there.

41:44.122 --> 41:46.625
Waiting for me on the
other side of the bridge.

41:47.966 --> 41:50.128
Willa's waiting for you, too.

41:51.760 --> 41:55.263
What greater motivation
than love?

41:59.267 --> 42:01.599
So...

42:01.600 --> 42:03.732
are we ready?

42:14.242 --> 42:15.744
Let's go.
