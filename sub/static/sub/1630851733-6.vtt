- So Eve.

01:00.827 --> 01:05.332
- While it hurts to see
my Ontario sister go,

01:05.332 --> 01:07.401
you know, that dough ain't ready

01:07.401 --> 01:08.869
to come out that oven yet.

01:08.869 --> 01:10.337
She almost baked.

01:10.337 --> 01:12.873
She chewy, but she ain't
finished.

01:12.873 --> 01:15.008
- Yeah, I really bonded
with her this week.

01:15.008 --> 01:16.009
I'm really gonna miss her.

01:16.009 --> 01:18.045
Actually, I love that girl a
lot.

01:18.045 --> 01:20.080
- You know, it's a competition,
y'all.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.915
And I'm the lip sync assassin.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.550

01:36.096 --> 01:37.864

01:37.864 --> 01:40.033
- Oh my God, the Gia moment!

01:40.901 --> 01:43.103
- Very well deserved. You looked
amazing.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.104
You look amazing.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.406
- Can I just get something out
of my head?

01:47.607 --> 01:49.676
I just want to know,

01:49.676 --> 01:52.412
is there a reason why I was
chose last?

01:53.280 --> 01:54.147
- Oh.

01:54.147 --> 01:55.983
- Come on, spicy Latina!

01:55.983 --> 01:57.784
- Oh my goodness.

01:57.784 --> 02:00.487
I think when I was choosing.

02:00.487 --> 02:04.491
I actually kept having
flashbacks of the Rusical.

02:04.491 --> 02:06.927
I was like, basing my perception
of you

02:06.927 --> 02:09.062
off of the character that you
played,

02:09.062 --> 02:12.265
and the role that you were
a part of was quite messy.

02:12.265 --> 02:14.334
- Yeah.
- We also never work together.

02:14.334 --> 02:15.168
- No.

02:15.168 --> 02:17.704
- It was more me just
wanting to switch it up,

02:17.704 --> 02:21.541
and I hate that feeling
that you had to feel,

02:21.541 --> 02:23.010
being picked last.

02:23.010 --> 02:25.078
I do apologize.

02:25.078 --> 02:27.681
- I do not want to hold any
grudge inside.

02:27.681 --> 02:29.216
I may have been picked last,

02:29.216 --> 02:30.917
but I'm a threat.

02:30.917 --> 02:35.389
You better watch out, the
Latina is coming for you.

02:35.389 --> 02:37.491
- Woo, and then there were
seven.

02:37.491 --> 02:39.326
- Holy shit!
- I know.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.561

One, two, three, four, five.

02:44.698 --> 02:45.899

02:45.899 --> 02:47.734
- We have not.
- They do not have wins.

02:47.734 --> 02:48.568
- Yeah.

02:48.568 --> 02:49.503
Throughout this entire
competition,

02:49.503 --> 02:53.340
I have been in the safe,
top kind of a zone.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.909
I need to take risks to ensure

02:55.909 --> 02:57.644
that I can elevate myself,

02:57.644 --> 02:59.279
and I just hope it pays off.

02:59.279 --> 03:01.448
- Well there it is!
- Yeah.

03:01.448 --> 03:03.350
- We're halfway through the
competition.

03:03.350 --> 03:04.851
It's time to be reinvigorated

03:04.851 --> 03:06.253

ever.

Unclean douche water.

07:55.241 --> 07:58.278
For example, this is
the texture of my hair.

07:58.278 --> 08:01.047
But my pubic hair is long and
blonde.

08:01.915 --> 08:02.749

but in the center there
is a phallic symbol.

08:18.198 --> 08:21.201
Because there's a dick inside of
us all

08:21.201 --> 08:22.769

08:22.769 --> 08:24.170
You're not pretty!

08:24.170 --> 08:26.473
You're fat! You're gonna be
lonely!

bottom here.

08:41.154 --> 08:42.789
Synthia's a very pretty girl,

08:42.789 --> 08:44.524
but when she gets stressed out,

08:44.524 --> 08:45.859
she leaves her body.

08:45.859 --> 08:50.397
Literally sucking her
thoughts away from her brain.

08:50.397 --> 08:52.699
She is a dumb blonde.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.934

08:54.934 --> 08:57.470
Icesis Couture.

09:20.026 --> 09:22.529
- This is a brick.

09:24.063 --> 09:25.064
House.

09:26.199 --> 09:30.370
And as we see, she is
peaking out from behind.

09:30.370 --> 09:31.838
There goes my jacket.

09:31.838 --> 09:33.773
Sabotage and delusion.

09:34.841 --> 09:35.675
(chuckling)

09:35.675 --> 09:37.811
- Icesis is killing me.

09:37.811 --> 09:40.280
I am holding myself so hard not
to laugh

09:40.280 --> 09:42.915
that I think I'm gonna implode.

09:42.915 --> 09:44.217
- She is peaking out.

09:46.052 --> 09:46.886
Peaking out.

09:48.221 --> 09:49.055
Peaking out.

09:50.590 --> 09:51.391
And scene.

09:52.559 --> 09:53.493
(all clapping)

09:53.493 --> 09:55.695
- That's brilliant, brilliant.
- Powerful stuff.

09:55.695 --> 09:57.430
- There is evil in this
painting.

09:59.032 --> 10:01.000
- Activate the dumpster fire.

10:01.000 --> 10:01.935
- Damn you to hell!

10:03.236 --> 10:07.474
(machine cranking)
(all wailing)

10:07.474 --> 10:12.278
(all screaming)
(alarm ringing)

10:12.278 --> 10:14.080
Oh shit, oh shit!

10:14.080 --> 10:16.783
- My god, her pussy is on fire!

10:16.783 --> 10:18.852
- Oh my God.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.490
- That was cathartic, wasn't it?

10:23.490 --> 10:27.260
All you saboteur dollies
made me Mona Lisa smile.

10:27.260 --> 10:31.297
Now, one of you created a
piece of work so exquisite

10:31.297 --> 10:33.132
that I would hang it above my
toilet.

10:35.068 --> 10:37.904
The winner of today's mini
challenge is,

10:38.771 --> 10:42.342
(suspenseful music)

10:42.342 --> 10:43.510
Icesis Couture.

10:43.510 --> 10:44.410
(all clapping)

10:44.410 --> 10:46.045
Bravo.

10:46.045 --> 10:48.715
You've won a $2000 gift card

10:48.715 --> 10:50.950
courtesy of Indochino.

10:50.950 --> 10:51.784
- Thank you.

10:51.784 --> 10:53.553
Yes yes yes yes yes!

10:53.553 --> 10:56.356
I'm your winner, and you're
welcome.

10:57.790 --> 11:00.026
- Queens, there's no painting
over this,

11:00.026 --> 11:01.427
but we're not angels.

11:01.427 --> 11:04.364
In fact, we're all as dirty as
sin.

11:05.198 --> 11:07.433
So, for this week's Maxi
Challenge,

11:07.433 --> 11:09.302
we're gonna have a hell of a
time.

11:09.302 --> 11:12.405
Tomorrow is the Sinner's Ball.

11:12.405 --> 11:15.475
(all cheering)
(exciting music)

11:15.475 --> 11:18.945
- We are having a ball!

11:18.945 --> 11:20.513
- A ball?

11:20.513 --> 11:21.948
Come on, baby.

11:21.948 --> 11:25.952
- You'll need to serve
three distinct looks.

11:25.952 --> 11:29.923
The first category is sex,
drugs, and rock and roll.

11:29.923 --> 11:31.291
- Shut up!
- I got you.

11:31.291 --> 11:34.827
- The second category is ugly as
sin.

11:34.827 --> 11:37.764
Serve eye sore couture
as you strut the runway

11:37.764 --> 11:39.432
in your ugliest looks.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.434
And look number three.

11:42.635 --> 11:46.406
(laughing maniacally)
(thunder rumbling)

11:46.406 --> 11:49.108
Using the materials that lie
beneath these tombstones,

11:49.108 --> 11:50.443
each of you will design a look

11:50.443 --> 11:53.379
based on one of the seven deadly
sins.

11:53.379 --> 11:54.714
From scratch.

11:55.582 --> 11:58.985
We want to see high
fashion looks that scream,

11:58.985 --> 12:02.522
"Forgive me mother, for I have
sinned!"

12:02.522 --> 12:04.958
Icesis, as winner of the mini
challenge,

12:04.958 --> 12:07.026
you'll get to assign the boxes.

12:07.026 --> 12:08.828
(laughing)

12:08.828 --> 12:09.662
- Of course.

12:09.662 --> 12:11.164
- Who wants to be my friend now?

12:11.164 --> 12:12.365
- We've been your friend, sis.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.467
- Which one are you choosing for
yourself?

12:14.467 --> 12:15.301
- Wrath.

12:15.301 --> 12:17.704
- Oh, that came fast.
(laughing)

12:17.704 --> 12:19.405
- Leather top daddy, oh!

12:19.405 --> 12:21.541
You want some of that?
(laughing)

12:21.541 --> 12:22.809
- So tell us, Icesis.

12:22.809 --> 12:25.511
Who is corrupt with greed?

12:25.511 --> 12:27.547
- As I'm looking at the boxes,

12:27.547 --> 12:28.948
the first thought in my head

12:28.948 --> 12:32.819
is to sabotage all of these
bitches.

12:32.819 --> 12:35.154
But then I think to myself,

12:35.154 --> 12:37.790
let's make it fair for everyone,

12:37.790 --> 12:38.725
because if I win,

12:38.725 --> 12:41.094
I want to win against the best.

12:41.094 --> 12:41.961
Greed.

12:42.862 --> 12:44.097
Synthia.

12:44.097 --> 12:44.964
Sloth.

12:46.099 --> 12:46.933
Gia.

12:48.134 --> 12:51.070
Pride, Kendall.

12:51.070 --> 12:53.439
Lust, oh my God.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.642
- I'm looking at you, Icesis,
come on.

12:56.676 --> 12:58.645
- Adriana.

12:58.645 --> 12:59.779
- I'm so excited!

12:59.779 --> 13:02.548
- Envy, Kimora.

13:02.548 --> 13:04.984
Gluttony, Pythia.

13:04.984 --> 13:06.319
Is everybody okay?
- That's the one I wanted!

13:06.319 --> 13:07.253
- Okay, work.

13:08.421 --> 13:11.124
- Y'all ready to dress to
transgress?

13:11.124 --> 13:13.626
Racers, start your engines,

13:13.626 --> 13:16.929
and may the best drag queen sin!

13:16.929 --> 13:18.531
(all wailing)
(upbeat music)

13:18.531 --> 13:20.099
(gasping)

13:20.099 --> 13:21.768
- Oh!
- Night of the Living Dead.

13:21.768 --> 13:23.336
- Oh!

13:23.336 --> 13:25.538
- Cool.
- Gorgeous.

13:25.538 --> 13:28.574
- This looks like the bottom of
my closet.

13:28.574 --> 13:30.543
- Ooh, she's kinky.

13:30.543 --> 13:31.377
- Ugh!

13:31.377 --> 13:34.213
- The Maxi Challenge this
week is the Sinner's Ball.

13:34.213 --> 13:35.048
Oh fun!

13:35.048 --> 13:37.450
We've got to rock not one, not
two,

13:37.450 --> 13:38.851
but three looks.

13:38.851 --> 13:41.320
And our final look, the deadly
sin,

13:41.320 --> 13:43.222
we've got to make in the Werk
Room,

13:43.222 --> 13:45.291
and present on the runway.

13:45.291 --> 13:48.494
- Lust is a perfect sin for me
because,

13:48.494 --> 13:51.064
Father, I am a sinner,

13:51.064 --> 13:53.266
and I'm not sorry about it.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.868
I actually love this box.

13:55.868 --> 13:57.470
Thank you, Icesis.
- I know,

13:57.470 --> 13:58.571
I'm happy with this stuff.

13:58.571 --> 14:00.573
Shit, we are having a slumber
party

14:00.573 --> 14:02.675
in my box, girls!

14:02.675 --> 14:04.944
- I got some vines.

14:06.779 --> 14:07.947
Oh, come on.

14:07.947 --> 14:10.349
Bitch, I am quaking in my boots.

14:10.349 --> 14:12.418
Tulle, okay.

14:12.418 --> 14:15.088
Vines! Vines and leaves, bitch.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.956
They're an odd off-green.

14:16.956 --> 14:18.991
Not even shiny, no luster.

14:18.991 --> 14:21.894
This is going to be an event.

14:21.894 --> 14:25.098
- This is going to be a
huge fucking challenge.

14:25.098 --> 14:28.167
The Ball is so important in Drag
Race.

14:28.167 --> 14:31.337
You have to create a garment
yourself,

14:31.337 --> 14:35.208
so the anxiety is trickling in.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.243
You really sew a lot, sure.

14:37.243 --> 14:40.079
(laughing)

14:40.079 --> 14:41.748
My first concept, honestly,

14:41.748 --> 14:45.051
is to get some sort of a base
garment,

14:45.051 --> 14:47.286
and just glue things on top of
it.

14:47.286 --> 14:49.655
I really want to take
the note from the judges,

14:49.655 --> 14:51.190
and push myself.

14:51.190 --> 14:54.026
I actually want to make the
entire garment

14:54.026 --> 14:55.128
from head to toe.

14:55.128 --> 14:58.064
And really accentuate the body

14:58.064 --> 15:02.635
and curves that make
Black women beautiful.

15:02.635 --> 15:03.970
This is ambitious.

15:03.970 --> 15:05.705
(dance music)

15:05.705 --> 15:07.440
- Looking around the room,

15:07.440 --> 15:08.908
looking at my sisters,

15:08.908 --> 15:10.877
everybody is happy.

15:10.877 --> 15:12.512
Kimora might be in trouble.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.981
She doesn't seem into it.

15:14.981 --> 15:17.150
How's things going?
- Horrible.

15:17.150 --> 15:18.718
- What's the matter? How can I
help?

15:18.718 --> 15:19.552
- You can't.

15:19.552 --> 15:21.854
I am worried about this goddamn
box.

15:21.854 --> 15:25.424
There is not enough material
in here to cover my ass.

15:25.424 --> 15:29.629
I'm thinking of doing an
Amazon kind of jungle thing.

15:29.629 --> 15:30.429
- You could also make it out of
that.

15:30.429 --> 15:31.798
- That is horribly ugly.

15:31.798 --> 15:33.432
- So you're alright?
- Yeah.

15:33.432 --> 15:35.835
- She just doesn't feel
inspired.

15:35.835 --> 15:37.470
If you need to bounce
off ideas or anything,

15:37.470 --> 15:39.539
just let me know.
(mumbling)

15:39.539 --> 15:40.373
She'll get there.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.108
Sis always pulls through.

15:42.108 --> 15:44.677
- So my lustful sister,

15:44.677 --> 15:46.546
what is the look, what is the
vision?

15:46.546 --> 15:49.048
- I am doing kind of a
nightgown,

15:49.048 --> 15:53.119
but transforming it in a cape.

15:53.119 --> 15:56.489
So it's more kind of Haute
couture style

15:56.489 --> 15:58.958
than just a nightgown.
- Lingerie?

15:58.958 --> 16:03.229
- I want to show body because
sex is body.

16:03.229 --> 16:04.831
But I don't want the judges to
say that

16:04.831 --> 16:07.200
I am just wearing lingerie.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.468
So I have to sew something,

16:09.468 --> 16:11.537
I have to glue gun something.

16:13.439 --> 16:16.776
There has to be a place in
between.

16:16.776 --> 16:19.779
Sorry, this is very lusty
what I'm doing right now.

16:19.779 --> 16:23.049
(upbeat music)

16:23.049 --> 16:25.117
- How you doing over there,
Synthia?

16:25.117 --> 16:26.652
- Oh you know, just like,

16:26.652 --> 16:29.622
trying to make sure it doesn't
look awful.

16:29.622 --> 16:30.456
(laughing)

16:30.456 --> 16:33.326
Icesis assigns me the sin of
greed,

16:33.326 --> 16:35.528
and I'm seeing a lot of gold.

16:35.528 --> 16:36.629
A lot, a lot of gold.

16:36.629 --> 16:39.565
Beads I can work with, play
with.

16:39.565 --> 16:43.936
It dawns on me that my design
challenge from week one

16:43.936 --> 16:45.872
was a gold look.

16:45.872 --> 16:48.908
I am using literally everything
in the box

16:48.908 --> 16:50.610
that isn't the gold material.

16:50.610 --> 16:53.012
I just don't want to repeat an
aesthetic

16:53.012 --> 16:55.081
that I already did in week one.

16:55.081 --> 16:57.783
- Do you have an idea?
- She's gonna be opulent.

16:57.783 --> 16:59.285
Like, the thing with greed,

16:59.285 --> 17:01.287
it's like material possession.

17:01.287 --> 17:04.223
So I just wanted to have
almost more is more is more.

17:04.223 --> 17:06.058
- Yeah, of course.
- How are you feeling?

17:06.058 --> 17:06.959
- I am good.

17:06.959 --> 17:08.828
Obviously, I got the box I
wanted.

17:08.828 --> 17:10.997
- Of course.
(laughing)

17:10.997 --> 17:12.298
- In my real life,

17:12.298 --> 17:15.935
I like doing more dark and
stuff,

17:15.935 --> 17:18.104
but none of the challenges
allowed that.

17:18.104 --> 17:20.106
- So then you can slip her in
here.

17:20.106 --> 17:21.274
- So I'm like, this is another
side of me

17:21.274 --> 17:23.142
that I'm really excited to show.

17:23.142 --> 17:24.143
Just to get like-
- Oh cool.

17:24.143 --> 17:25.278
- Be fucking weird.

17:25.278 --> 17:27.313
- Yeah, get weird, yo.

17:27.313 --> 17:28.981
- I'm weird, yo.
- Yo.

17:28.981 --> 17:31.317
(laughing)

17:31.317 --> 17:32.485
- Gia.

17:32.485 --> 17:34.020
- Hi baby girl.
- How are you doing?

17:34.020 --> 17:35.388
What sin do you have?

17:35.388 --> 17:37.356
- So I have sloth.
- Sloth, cool.

17:37.356 --> 17:38.524
- I have sloth.

17:38.524 --> 17:43.529
And my concept is got home after
a show,

17:43.996 --> 17:47.099
and was like, too lazy
to take my makeup off.

17:47.099 --> 17:47.967
So I'm gonna have,

17:47.967 --> 17:49.368
I'm just gonna have a house
coat,

17:49.368 --> 17:52.538
and I think I'm gonna try
to make a onesie underneath.

17:52.538 --> 17:54.807
- That's so campy.
- The last time I was involved

17:54.807 --> 17:55.841
in a design challenge,

17:55.841 --> 17:58.644
I was lip syncing for my life.

17:59.512 --> 18:01.547
I'm just, I'm kind of just going
with it.

18:01.547 --> 18:04.550
It's top seven, and there is no
time

18:04.550 --> 18:06.052
for second guessing.

18:06.052 --> 18:07.219
How are you doing over there?

18:07.219 --> 18:09.088
- Good.
- What's your box again?

18:09.088 --> 18:10.856
- It is gluttony.
- Yeah.

18:10.856 --> 18:13.059
- It's very colorful and bright
and sweet,

18:13.059 --> 18:14.827
which is not my drag.

18:14.827 --> 18:16.963
The Ball is a huge deal,

18:16.963 --> 18:19.899
so there's a lot of pressure to
do well.

18:19.899 --> 18:21.968
My biggest competition for
this challenge would be

18:21.968 --> 18:23.669
Synthia and Icesis.

18:23.669 --> 18:25.104
They're both designers,

18:25.104 --> 18:28.407
and they have really great
skills and aesthetics.

18:28.407 --> 18:31.110
So I want to stand out.

18:31.110 --> 18:34.246
I really want to put a twist to
it,

18:34.246 --> 18:35.514
you know what I mean?
- Of course.

18:35.514 --> 18:38.684
- Do you know like, Hansel
and Gretel, like the witch?

18:38.684 --> 18:39.919
That eats children.
- Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

18:39.919 --> 18:41.921
- My version of gluttony will be
that.

18:41.921 --> 18:42.755
It's gonna be a little creepy,

18:42.755 --> 18:44.457
but very glamorous and high
fashion.

18:44.457 --> 18:45.524
- I love it.
- Yeah.

18:45.524 --> 18:46.726
- I'm having a slumber party,

18:46.726 --> 18:48.794
you're eating us.
- I'm feeding, yeah.

18:48.794 --> 18:49.628
- There we go.

18:49.628 --> 18:52.298
- It's the battle of the
designers.

18:52.298 --> 18:53.132
I'm gonna win.

18:54.066 --> 18:56.802
(dramatic music)

18:58.337 --> 19:00.339
- How do you think some of
the other queens are gonna do?

19:00.339 --> 19:01.941
With less sewing experience.

19:03.009 --> 19:06.946
- Kimora's not seeming the most
confident.

19:06.946 --> 19:08.848
I like what she's working on,

19:08.848 --> 19:12.251
but I feel like she's kind
of in her head a little bit.

19:13.319 --> 19:16.589
Gia took a second to figure
out what she was doing,

19:16.589 --> 19:19.959
but like, for a girl who
says she can't sew, like-

19:19.959 --> 19:22.561
- No, she's got the foundation
there.

19:22.561 --> 19:23.629
Pythia, oh cool.

19:23.629 --> 19:25.297
Oh my god, she's so fast.

19:25.297 --> 19:30.002
- Yeah, she's also very good
at constructing garments.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.303
- I'm intimidated.
- Yeah.

19:31.303 --> 19:33.005
- So let's see what this Ball
brings.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.408
- Yeah, for sure, I'm so
excited.

19:35.408 --> 19:37.043
- Can't wait.
- Can't wait.

19:37.043 --> 19:39.945
(dance music)

19:39.945 --> 19:41.714
- It's coming together.
At least it's something.

19:43.349 --> 19:45.618
- Bonjour, my salacious sinners.

19:45.618 --> 19:46.452
- Hi.

19:47.553 --> 19:49.255
- Are you ready to go
to hell in a handbag?

19:49.255 --> 19:50.689
- I'll see you there, girl.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.391
- I can't wait to see you all

19:52.391 --> 19:54.527
raise a little hell on
the runway tomorrow.

19:54.527 --> 19:58.297
But, make sure to look your
absolute best.

19:58.297 --> 20:01.567
Because joining us as our
extra special guest judge

20:01.567 --> 20:04.336
is the one, the only,

20:06.806 --> 20:08.541
Gigi Gorgeous!

20:08.541 --> 20:09.375
(queens wailing)

20:09.375 --> 20:11.110
- What? Shut up!
- Stop! What?

20:11.110 --> 20:12.845
- Oh my god!

20:13.712 --> 20:15.881
- Gigi Gorgeous, oh my god.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.883
I am literally fan-girling.

20:17.883 --> 20:18.717
- What!

20:19.919 --> 20:22.088
I almost start crying.

20:22.088 --> 20:23.389
- That's iconic.

20:23.389 --> 20:26.492
- Gigi Gorgeous has been so
vocal about

20:26.492 --> 20:29.395
trans rights, trans
representation,

20:29.395 --> 20:32.998
and it is so inspiring for so
many of us.

20:32.998 --> 20:36.302
Can we get any more
iconic? I don't think so.

20:36.302 --> 20:39.572
- Good luck, and don't fuck it
up.

20:41.207 --> 20:42.141
- Bye, pretty lady.

20:43.375 --> 20:46.512
- Gigi knows her fashion,
and she knows her style,

20:46.512 --> 20:48.747
so there's a lot of
pressure in that way, too.

20:48.747 --> 20:50.883
- Yeah, I'm like, I'm fully
gagged.

20:50.883 --> 20:53.953
- Yeah.
(suspenseful music)

20:56.088 --> 20:58.557
- Hello.
- Come on, come on, come on.

20:58.557 --> 20:59.825
It's elimination day.

20:59.825 --> 21:01.393
I am still terrified.

21:01.393 --> 21:04.897
I'm seeing gowns, I'm
seeing everything around me.

21:04.897 --> 21:06.966
Bitch, I need to step this us.

21:06.966 --> 21:11.103
Okay girls, I actually have
a little bit of a question.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.038
I sometimes have a hard time

21:13.038 --> 21:17.042
with all the new different
letters of the alphabet

21:17.042 --> 21:20.613
that are added now into
the whole LGBT community.

21:20.613 --> 21:23.082
So, you know, there's
queer, there's trans,

21:23.082 --> 21:25.951
but now the trans umbrella
has opened up so much.

21:25.951 --> 21:28.120
And it's sometimes a
little confusing for me.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.955
Making sure I'm giving the right
pronouns,

21:29.955 --> 21:32.558
and the right association to
everyone.

21:32.558 --> 21:34.760
I find it difficult sometimes.

21:34.760 --> 21:35.661
- So what's your question?

21:35.661 --> 21:38.030
- Well, the question,
my question is, bitch,

21:38.030 --> 21:39.031
is basically like, okay,

21:39.031 --> 21:41.867
so what does everyone
here kind of identify as?

21:41.867 --> 21:43.669
Because I want to make sure that

21:43.669 --> 21:46.539
I talk to you as you need to be
addressed.

21:46.539 --> 21:47.773
- Yeah, that's really kind.

21:47.773 --> 21:49.208
I'll speak for myself.

21:49.208 --> 21:51.243
I identify as a queer male,

21:51.243 --> 21:52.444
as opposed to a gay male.

21:52.444 --> 21:54.013
- What's a little bit
more of that definition?

21:54.013 --> 21:55.915
Because to me, I've always felt
that

21:55.915 --> 21:58.017
queer just meant you're not
bisexual,

21:58.017 --> 22:00.019
you're not gay, you're
kind of that kind of,

22:00.019 --> 22:01.487
fluid in-between.

22:01.487 --> 22:03.722
- You know, like queer is sort
of a reclaiming of the word,

22:03.722 --> 22:05.824
because to its root it means
weird, right?

22:05.824 --> 22:06.692
- Exactly.
- Or an outcast.

22:06.692 --> 22:10.062
For me, I don't like masculine
expectations on myself.

22:10.062 --> 22:11.630
I don't like feminine
expectations on myself.

22:11.630 --> 22:12.631
I don't see myself as a woman,

22:12.631 --> 22:14.266
but I don't feel like a man
either.

22:14.266 --> 22:16.035
It's like I sort of like
identify with the other.

22:16.035 --> 22:19.071
And it's more like about like,
liberation,

22:19.071 --> 22:20.039
and it's more political

22:20.039 --> 22:21.540
and it's a little more open than
just gay

22:21.540 --> 22:24.043
because I think queer is more
open to

22:25.211 --> 22:26.512
many different identities.

22:26.512 --> 22:28.380
- I do identify as non-binary,

22:28.380 --> 22:31.517
and prefer the pronouns
they/them.

22:31.517 --> 22:32.351
- Okay I didn't know that.

22:32.351 --> 22:33.185
So thank you for letting me
know.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.320
- Yeah. I like to say that I'm
like,

22:34.320 --> 22:36.589
a tie-dye of gender.

22:36.589 --> 22:38.090
- I like that!

22:38.090 --> 22:39.525
- That's beautiful.
- Like for me,

22:39.525 --> 22:41.660
they/them has always been
a little difficult for me,

22:41.660 --> 22:43.195
because growing up,

22:43.195 --> 22:44.863
especially, I don't
know for all Caribbeans,

22:44.863 --> 22:46.498
but I know in my household,

22:46.498 --> 22:49.735
calling someone a they/them
was just disrespectful.

22:49.735 --> 22:50.869
- I feel the same with Kimora

22:50.869 --> 22:52.738
the way that I was brought up,

22:52.738 --> 22:56.041
calling somebody "they" is very
offensive.

22:56.041 --> 22:58.711
- Yeah.
- So it does take a while

22:58.711 --> 23:02.014
to re-learn and just come at
people

23:02.014 --> 23:03.782
with the way that they want to
be.

23:03.782 --> 23:05.584
- And the way you approached
it, Kimora, is great.

23:05.584 --> 23:06.418
It's like, you know what I mean?

23:06.418 --> 23:07.953
I'm old school, I don't really
understand.

23:07.953 --> 23:10.389
You were like, I want to ask
questions

23:10.389 --> 23:12.157
so I can understand you better.

23:12.157 --> 23:14.994
Having this conversation is so
important.

23:14.994 --> 23:17.896
I'm working out of the LGBTQ
community,

23:17.896 --> 23:20.532
and we're not talking about it
at all.

23:20.532 --> 23:22.301
We're still doing the letters

23:22.301 --> 23:26.472
with Monsieur, Madame, Mister,
Misses,

23:26.472 --> 23:29.708
and we don't even know
who we're talking to.

23:29.708 --> 23:32.611
- I love the fact that we
can talk about these things,

23:32.611 --> 23:33.646
because-
- It's probably hard

23:33.646 --> 23:35.914
because for some people,
it's such a trigger.

23:36.782 --> 23:37.616
Do you know what I mean?

23:37.616 --> 23:39.184
Like, if someone does
get the pronoun wrong,

23:39.184 --> 23:43.322
the consensus of just like,
patience and a dialogue.

23:43.322 --> 23:44.790
I think it's a really powerful
message

23:44.790 --> 23:47.693
when even drag queens are
struggling

23:47.693 --> 23:49.161
with some of those pronouns.

23:49.161 --> 23:51.463
We really need to keep evolving,
you know?

23:51.463 --> 23:55.401
We update our phones on a
monthly basis,

23:55.401 --> 23:57.336
why wouldn't we update our
language?

23:57.336 --> 23:58.170
You know what I mean?

23:58.170 --> 24:00.172
Like, we just have to
keep leveling up, people.

24:00.172 --> 24:02.207
It's what it's about.

24:02.207 --> 24:04.310
- Great conversation, ladies.

24:04.310 --> 24:05.244
- Just don't call me ma'am.

24:05.244 --> 24:06.679
Oh God, I hate ma'am.

24:06.679 --> 24:08.347
- You do give ma'am energy,
though.

24:08.347 --> 24:11.083
- Yeah, you kinda do.

35:13.478 --> 35:15.480
if you were a cat, if you ate

35:30.762 --> 35:32.597

35:32.597 --> 35:33.932
- I wanted to accentuate it.

35:33.932 --> 35:35.133
- Yes.
- Kind of did it on purpose

35:35.133 --> 35:37.035
so it looked really over the
top.

35:37.035 --> 35:40.372
It was sort of to exemplify
that beauty standard

35:40.372 --> 35:42.073

critiqued for

35:42.073 --> 35:42.941

I'm just going to say,

35:57.022 --> 35:59.190

36:01.626 --> 36:03.795

like a fashion girl in there.

36:06.765 --> 36:08.900
- Totally.
- I disagree with you Brad

36:08.900 --> 36:11.403

suit for a rock star.

36:11.403 --> 36:14.906
I love how you incorporated
BLM in your look tonight.

36:14.906 --> 36:16.741

admire a lot.

36:18.877 --> 36:20.578

36:27.952 --> 36:28.920

36:28.920 --> 36:30.688
is that's something that I
admire.

36:30.688 --> 36:31.723
When I saw that,

36:31.723 --> 36:33.324
and when I saw the rock and
roll,

36:33.324 --> 36:35.860
I was like, wow, season
two came to bring it.

36:35.860 --> 36:36.928

36:37.896 --> 36:39.898

36:39.898 --> 36:41.733
Your makeup looks lovely.

36:41.733 --> 36:45.036

36:46.037 --> 36:48.540
And as a cat person myself,

36:48.540 --> 36:50.308
I appreciated that side of it.

36:50.308 --> 36:51.376
I would've liked it if you had

36:51.376 --> 36:53.745
taken it more literal with the
cat lady.

36:53.745 --> 36:55.680

36:55.680 --> 36:57.615

you.

36:57.615 --> 36:59.084

37:02.887 --> 37:04.589
- First look that you came out
in

37:04.589 --> 37:07.792
was such a good spin on the
rocker look.

37:07.792 --> 37:10.395
I wish in the first challenge,

37:10.395 --> 37:11.830
you'd done a different
silhouette,

37:11.830 --> 37:14.065
'cause I'd already seen that on
you.

37:14.065 --> 37:15.667

37:26.845 --> 37:28.713
It was ugly, it was tacky,

37:28.713 --> 37:30.081
and you were covered in gum.

37:30.081 --> 37:32.283
It gave me very third grade art
teacher.

37:32.283 --> 37:33.818
- Yes!
- This look is incredible,

37:33.818 --> 37:34.953
especially from someone

37:34.953 --> 37:36.588
who almost went home week one

37:36.588 --> 37:37.922
for the design challenge.
- Yeah, girl.

37:37.922 --> 37:38.890
- So great job this week.

37:38.890 --> 37:39.891
- Thank you so much.

37:41.025 --> 37:42.093
- Adriana.
- Hi.

37:42.093 --> 37:45.530
- I have to start with
your ugly as sin look.

37:45.530 --> 37:47.332
I thought it was the funniest,

37:47.332 --> 37:48.867
cutest little thing in
the whole wide world.

37:48.867 --> 37:52.604
I don't know if everyone
will agree, but I loved it.

37:52.604 --> 37:55.773
- I was cackling from
literally when you walked out

37:55.773 --> 37:57.475
until when you walked away.

37:57.475 --> 38:00.478
And you were just so
committed and so funny.

38:00.478 --> 38:02.247
- One thing I really appreciate
about you

38:02.247 --> 38:04.115
is how versatile you can be.

38:04.115 --> 38:07.452
The first runway, you were
very badass rocker chick,

38:07.452 --> 38:10.555
and then come out in
that ugly second look.

38:10.555 --> 38:12.757
You can be so beautiful and so
poised,

38:12.757 --> 38:14.592
but also just so stupid.

38:14.592 --> 38:16.194
And I love it.

38:16.194 --> 38:17.629
- I will say with this lust,

38:17.629 --> 38:20.265
I was a bit let down.

38:20.265 --> 38:22.467
I feel like it's just sort of a
corset,

38:22.467 --> 38:24.169
a bit of a shawl, with some
garters,

38:24.169 --> 38:25.436
with flowers stuck on them.

38:25.436 --> 38:26.871
I would like to have seen more.

38:26.871 --> 38:27.906
- Okay.

38:27.906 --> 38:30.008
- It's the titties for me.

38:30.008 --> 38:32.310
When you were walking,
it was just jiggle city,

38:32.310 --> 38:34.112
and I was so in love.

38:34.112 --> 38:34.946
(laughing)

38:34.946 --> 38:36.748
- What I love about you is that

38:36.748 --> 38:39.717
there's always this amazing
attention to detail.

38:39.717 --> 38:43.721
With this, I lost the things
that I love about you.

38:43.721 --> 38:46.558
I feel like it's messy lust, for
me.

38:46.558 --> 38:49.093
And I think we've broken
up over this look.

38:49.093 --> 38:50.128
(gasping)

38:50.128 --> 38:51.563
Not like totally, ever.

38:51.563 --> 38:54.265
I'm just saying I feel like
we're taking like a little,

38:54.265 --> 38:56.701
we're taking a time out.
- I understand.

38:56.701 --> 38:58.536
- Icesis Couture.

38:58.536 --> 38:59.370
- Hi.

38:59.370 --> 39:01.639
- You just keep on living up
to your last name, for me.

39:01.639 --> 39:04.142
It's couture couture couture
always.

39:04.142 --> 39:08.479
I loved the Misfits take on
sex, drugs, and rock and roll.

39:08.479 --> 39:10.882
It was really fun to see you
girly,

39:10.882 --> 39:12.850
but in a really punky way.

39:12.850 --> 39:13.685
- It was good.

39:13.685 --> 39:16.654
It was, for me, a little bit
basic.

39:16.654 --> 39:18.856
Essentially, it was a body suit.

39:18.856 --> 39:20.625
But it wasn't bad.

39:20.625 --> 39:21.960
This look is incredible.

39:21.960 --> 39:23.328
You give me Ryan Burke.

39:23.328 --> 39:24.462
Do you know who Ryan Burke is?

39:24.462 --> 39:26.097
In the makeup a little bit.

39:26.097 --> 39:26.965
I love it.

39:26.965 --> 39:29.534
- The thing that I really
respect the most about you

39:29.534 --> 39:31.569
is that every look that you do
execute

39:31.569 --> 39:33.137
is always high fashion.

39:33.137 --> 39:34.606
I think that you are marvelous.

39:34.606 --> 39:36.474
You know that, congratulations,
well done.

39:36.474 --> 39:37.976
- I see it. I see fashion.

39:37.976 --> 39:39.510
I see diversity.

39:39.510 --> 39:41.045
And your ugly look was stunning.

39:41.045 --> 39:42.747
I was surprised that
these people liked it.

39:42.747 --> 39:44.249
I thought they were gonna rip
you apart.

39:44.249 --> 39:45.950
I was like, ready to fight for
you.

39:45.950 --> 39:46.784
- Aw!

39:46.784 --> 39:48.386
- But yeah, round of applause.

39:48.386 --> 39:51.189
It was so gorge.
(laughing)

39:51.189 --> 39:52.557
- [Brooke Lynn] Synthia Kiss.

39:52.557 --> 39:53.458
- Hello, guys.

39:53.458 --> 39:55.093
- The first look, for me,

39:55.093 --> 39:58.596
I get the kind of 70s
groupie thing happening.

39:58.596 --> 40:01.132
But it really, it didn't work
for me.

40:01.132 --> 40:05.203
And I feel like in the
ugly as sin challenge,

40:05.203 --> 40:07.505
we saw you at your most
beautiful

40:07.505 --> 40:09.707
since this competition started.

40:09.707 --> 40:12.377
- I thought the short hair
was gonna like, freak it out,

40:12.377 --> 40:13.211
and I was like, oh my god,

40:13.211 --> 40:14.412
I look stunning in short hair.

40:14.412 --> 40:15.680
Like I literally-
- Listen.

40:15.680 --> 40:17.148
- I've literally never worn
short hair,

40:17.148 --> 40:20.318
and I was like, I'm too fucking
pretty for this right now.

40:20.318 --> 40:22.253
- You could tell that you felt
good.

40:22.253 --> 40:23.855
There was this inner confidence

40:23.855 --> 40:25.723
that came out of this ugly look.

40:25.723 --> 40:27.458
And that's what confused me.

40:27.458 --> 40:29.394
The first look I didn't love.

40:29.394 --> 40:30.728
It felt like it's something I
could see

40:30.728 --> 40:32.730
at a Halloween costume shop.

40:32.730 --> 40:34.432
This, I think, is fantastic.

40:34.432 --> 40:35.600
I would wear this

40:35.600 --> 40:37.402
to go and pick up my children
from school.

40:37.402 --> 40:38.269
- Kids, let's go.

40:39.170 --> 40:42.707
- First look, I am strongly
disagreeing with these two,

40:42.707 --> 40:45.243
because I actually quite
enjoyed that first look.

40:45.243 --> 40:47.278
- Brooke Lynn, oh my god.
- I loved it.

40:47.278 --> 40:48.112
I did, I loved it.
- Me too!

40:48.112 --> 40:49.681
- Heck yes, okay.

40:49.681 --> 40:51.015
- Brad and I did not.

40:51.015 --> 40:52.550
- Fight, fight.

40:52.550 --> 40:55.353
(laughing)

40:55.353 --> 40:56.187
- Kimora Amour.

40:57.522 --> 41:02.527
My dear, I want to go straight
to your ugly as sin look,

41:02.527 --> 41:03.995
and thank you and commend you

41:03.995 --> 41:05.563
from the bottom of my heart.

41:05.563 --> 41:07.665
I thought it was such a
powerful,

41:07.665 --> 41:10.401
compelling piece of work.

41:10.401 --> 41:11.903
(dramatic music)

41:11.903 --> 41:16.808
- There are a lot of portrayals,

41:16.808 --> 41:18.376
when it comes to slavery,

41:19.677 --> 41:22.480
and it is visceral,

41:22.480 --> 41:23.848
and it hurts.

41:23.848 --> 41:25.850
We are a set of people who
honestly

41:25.850 --> 41:27.785
do not know where we come from.

41:27.785 --> 41:29.954
We literally have no home.

41:29.954 --> 41:32.957
It's why I take such
pride in being Guyanese,

41:32.957 --> 41:36.994
because it gives me
something to hold on to.

41:36.994 --> 41:41.165
And that emotion came
forward on the stage today.

41:41.165 --> 41:45.837
The pain and the
suffering is ugly as hell,

41:45.837 --> 41:48.439
and I don't think the
world often sees that

41:48.439 --> 41:52.643
and understands how much it
still hurts our community.

41:52.643 --> 41:53.878
- I thought it was beautiful.

41:53.878 --> 41:55.713
Thank you for bringing your
humanity.

41:55.713 --> 41:58.383
- I love watching you walk a
runway.

41:58.383 --> 41:59.250
It's so much fun.

41:59.250 --> 42:01.018
You always give us something
different.

42:01.018 --> 42:04.021
This look, I think it's very,
very cool.

42:04.021 --> 42:05.656
It's very whimsical.

42:05.656 --> 42:07.725
It's right on the money with
envy.

42:07.725 --> 42:08.860
- Thank you so much.

42:08.860 --> 42:10.962
- I love this look as well.

42:10.962 --> 42:12.330
I got envy right away.

42:12.330 --> 42:15.199
I mean, it says envy on
your hat, so I got it.

42:15.199 --> 42:18.669
It's whimsical, it still has
elements

42:18.669 --> 42:20.571
of what we love about you,

42:20.571 --> 42:23.107
and I thought you really
brought it to life.

42:23.107 --> 42:25.676
- The Tina Turner look, you gave
it to me.

42:25.676 --> 42:27.378
You shimmied all the way down,

42:27.378 --> 42:30.415
and I was like, I love this
queen.

42:30.415 --> 42:31.249
- Thank you.

42:31.249 --> 42:33.217
- I respect you, I respect your
drag.

42:33.217 --> 42:36.454
The world stood still when
you walked down that runway.

42:36.454 --> 42:37.855
- Thank you.

42:37.855 --> 42:40.057
- Thank you, queens.

42:40.057 --> 42:42.026
While you untuck in the Werk
Room,

42:42.026 --> 42:43.995
the judges will make deviled
eggs.

42:47.298 --> 42:50.601
(dramatic music)

42:50.601 --> 42:53.871
- Yo, we just did a fucking
Ball, bitches.

42:55.840 --> 42:57.909
- Kimora, I'd love to
start with your moment.

42:57.909 --> 42:59.610
I was literally in tears.

42:59.610 --> 43:00.511
- Thank you.

43:00.511 --> 43:01.345
- No, it was really,
really, really beautiful.

43:01.345 --> 43:03.881
Thank you so much for like,
creating that.

43:03.881 --> 43:04.849
- Thank you, thank you.

43:04.849 --> 43:06.784
- We said Black girl magic
was coming this week,

43:06.784 --> 43:08.119
did we not?
- We said it, we said it.

43:08.119 --> 43:09.420
Come on, baby.
(laughing)

43:09.420 --> 43:12.657
- Did anyone disagree
with any of the critiques

43:12.657 --> 43:13.491
that they got?

43:13.491 --> 43:15.426
I feel like, Adriana, you
were gonna say something.

43:15.426 --> 43:17.328
- Yeah.
- How do you feel?

43:17.328 --> 43:19.197
With your squishy titties.
- Yeah, sorry.

43:19.197 --> 43:20.231
- I was gonna say, I was like,

43:20.231 --> 43:22.600
or just do you, just do you.
- As I play with the titties.

43:22.600 --> 43:24.735
- I feel exhausted.

43:24.735 --> 43:26.938
They called my look lazy,
actually.

43:26.938 --> 43:28.039
- Yeah.
- Which...

43:28.039 --> 43:28.873
- And that hurts,

43:28.873 --> 43:30.341
because you were working-
- I worked so hard.

43:30.341 --> 43:32.677
- You were working until the
last second.

43:32.677 --> 43:33.511
- Oh, why?

43:35.680 --> 43:38.950
I really thought that
I could be in the top.

43:38.950 --> 43:41.886
I understand that at this
point in the competition,

43:41.886 --> 43:43.921
it's the details that count,

43:43.921 --> 43:46.257
and showing a little bit more
body

43:46.257 --> 43:49.093
can be seen as simple.

43:49.093 --> 43:51.295
But I still think it's
beautiful.

43:51.295 --> 43:54.031
- Baby bird, oh bitch.

43:55.600 --> 43:59.504
- The judges love what I
created.

43:59.504 --> 44:02.139
The whole package, they got it.

44:02.139 --> 44:04.141
- And how is everyone feeling,
like-

44:04.141 --> 44:05.276
- That's what I said,

44:05.276 --> 44:06.210
I feel like it could go any way

44:06.210 --> 44:08.212
because you just don't know.

44:08.212 --> 44:11.148
Because we all have a little
bit of negative, I feel,

44:11.148 --> 44:13.417
with our positives.

44:13.417 --> 44:16.220
- I definitely think that
Synthia will be lip syncing,

44:16.220 --> 44:17.889
just based off of the critiques.

44:17.889 --> 44:19.290
- Yeah, no I get it.
- One thing I do want to say

44:19.290 --> 44:22.393
quickly is that everything that
you

44:22.393 --> 44:23.594
brought to this competition

44:23.594 --> 44:24.662
and that you have shown

44:24.662 --> 44:26.697
is so true to who you are.

44:26.697 --> 44:28.065
- And your drag is beautiful.

44:28.065 --> 44:29.100
And I hope you know that.

44:29.100 --> 44:29.934
- I do.
- I know you do.

44:29.934 --> 44:31.536
- And I appreciate you saying it
though.

44:31.536 --> 44:32.870
- Of course.
- In Drag Race history,

44:32.870 --> 44:36.007
the thing about lip syncing
for your life three times,

44:36.007 --> 44:38.910
is it's typically a sign

44:38.910 --> 44:41.212
it might be the Synthia Kiss of
death.

44:41.212 --> 44:44.181
I really, really would like to
avoid that.

44:45.116 --> 44:45.950
- Can I have a squish?

44:45.950 --> 44:46.784
- Yes, of course.

44:46.784 --> 44:48.953
- Come on, boop, boop boop.

44:48.953 --> 44:50.655
(laughing)

44:50.655 --> 44:51.489
(engines revving)
(dance music)

44:51.489 --> 44:54.659
- Okay, so just between us fire
crotches,

44:54.659 --> 44:56.360
what did you think?

44:56.360 --> 44:57.995
Let's start with Pythia.

44:57.995 --> 45:00.631
- Her ugly as sin look
was polished, you know?

45:00.631 --> 45:02.833
It was so silly and so fun.

45:02.833 --> 45:05.269
And the details on her
seven deadly sins look,

45:05.269 --> 45:09.040
the candy buttons, the candy on
her face,

45:09.040 --> 45:12.410
you knew exactly what her deadly
sin was.

45:12.410 --> 45:15.479
- The makeup artistry is just
top notch,

45:15.479 --> 45:17.515
and I feel like coming
from a beauty background,

45:17.515 --> 45:18.983
I respect that a lot.

45:18.983 --> 45:20.484
- I'm splitting hairs here.

45:20.484 --> 45:23.554
I want her to push a little
more,

45:23.554 --> 45:25.122
have a little more fun on the
runway,

45:25.122 --> 45:26.691
'cause the looks are amazing.

45:26.691 --> 45:27.992
I want more confidence.
- You think so?

45:27.992 --> 45:29.026
- I absolutely do.

45:29.026 --> 45:30.861
- I liked tonight with the first
look,

45:30.861 --> 45:33.264
that we got to see another side
of her.

45:33.264 --> 45:36.567
Something a little more
edgy, cooler, punk rock.

45:36.567 --> 45:38.336
I feel like she comes
out here and does like

45:38.336 --> 45:39.570
a trot and a twirl,

45:39.570 --> 45:41.806
and she's always like
giggling and having fun.

45:41.806 --> 45:43.140
- But always giggling and having
fun

45:43.140 --> 45:44.508
like sort of across the board.

45:44.508 --> 45:46.377
I'd like to see different
characters.

45:46.377 --> 45:47.445
- I'd like to see her serve us

45:47.445 --> 45:48.946
like a serious runway walk.

45:48.946 --> 45:50.081
- Yeah.

45:50.081 --> 45:51.649
- Adriana.

45:51.649 --> 45:54.218
I think Adriana is so versatile.

45:54.218 --> 45:55.820
She can serve a serious sexy,

45:55.820 --> 45:58.589
and then she can give
us something so campy.

45:58.589 --> 46:01.425
- Her ugly as sin look is
the cutest little thing.

46:01.425 --> 46:02.393
- Which I loved.

46:02.393 --> 46:03.561
And then the third look,

46:03.561 --> 46:07.164
it was essentially some
flowers around her titty bib.

46:07.164 --> 46:08.833
It was just meh.

46:08.833 --> 46:11.569
- Yeah, for me, she won my
heart with the versatility.

46:11.569 --> 46:13.537
I see so much potential there.

46:13.537 --> 46:15.439
And with the Ball, you need
versatility,

46:15.439 --> 46:17.708
and I feel like she gave me
that.

46:17.708 --> 46:18.976
- Kendall Gender.

46:18.976 --> 46:22.113
I think Kendall looked really
beautiful in the first runway.

46:22.113 --> 46:23.180
It was a body suit,

46:23.180 --> 46:25.116
and we've seen her in a lot of
those.

46:25.116 --> 46:28.653
The third look, the execution
of it wasn't horrible,

46:28.653 --> 46:30.354
but the cut of it in the front

46:30.354 --> 46:31.789
just made it very dowdy.

46:31.789 --> 46:33.591
- I loved the comment about

46:33.591 --> 46:35.359
African American women's bodies,

46:35.359 --> 46:36.527
and accentuating those curves.

46:36.527 --> 46:37.762
I thought that was really smart.

46:37.762 --> 46:40.231
She is pushing herself
and stretching outside.

46:40.231 --> 46:42.633
However, the execution doesn't
hold up

46:42.633 --> 46:45.036
to the other people that we have
on stage.

46:45.036 --> 46:47.805
- The sex, drugs, and rock
and roll was a wow for me.

46:47.805 --> 46:49.874
I'm like, Kendall is here, I'm
excited.

46:49.874 --> 46:51.375
And then everything from then on

46:51.375 --> 46:53.778
kind of just went downhill,
and it wasn't her night.

46:53.778 --> 46:55.880
- I'm at that stage in the
competition

46:55.880 --> 46:59.950
where I'm wanting Kendall to
just wow me.

46:59.950 --> 47:00.951
- [Brooke Lynn] Okay, up next,

47:00.951 --> 47:03.387
we need to talk about Icesis
Couture.

47:03.387 --> 47:05.923
- I loved the colorful, fluffy,

47:05.923 --> 47:07.825
sex, drugs, and rock and roll
look.

47:07.825 --> 47:09.527
- It was a body suit
with a leather jacket.

47:09.527 --> 47:13.197
It was very neon 80s thing.

47:13.197 --> 47:15.499
- 80s was neon!
- I'm so mad at you.

47:15.499 --> 47:16.333
- Were you born in the 80s?

47:16.333 --> 47:17.168
- Yes.

47:17.168 --> 47:18.002
I'm not saying it was bad,

47:18.002 --> 47:19.637
I'm just saying it was
a little bit simplistic.

47:19.637 --> 47:20.538
Knowing what she can do,

47:20.538 --> 47:21.372
and knowing what we've
come to expect from her-

47:21.372 --> 47:23.074
- She made a leather jacket.

47:23.074 --> 47:25.876
It was so opposite of a lot of
the looks

47:25.876 --> 47:26.977
we've seen her do.

47:26.977 --> 47:28.946
Think about her going from

47:28.946 --> 47:32.383
that bright neon crazy wig and
that look,

47:32.383 --> 47:35.720
to what we saw as her seven
deadly sins look at wrath.

47:35.720 --> 47:38.355
It's like, how is that
even the same queen?

47:38.355 --> 47:39.190
- That's true.

47:39.190 --> 47:43.094
- The ugly as sin look
was, I thought, fabulous.

47:43.094 --> 47:43.928
- I loved it.

47:43.928 --> 47:47.164
It was exactly that crocheted
doll at your grandma's house.

47:47.164 --> 47:48.799
- Just grandma crochet realness,

47:48.799 --> 47:49.967
back of the toilet realness?

47:49.967 --> 47:50.868
Is that what we're talking
about?

47:50.868 --> 47:52.303
That's a different kind of
realness.

47:52.303 --> 47:53.971
(all laughing)

47:53.971 --> 47:56.741
- When I look at her, I
see fashion, I see art.

47:56.741 --> 47:58.943
And I feel like I hold her now
up here.

47:58.943 --> 48:02.413
- I'm just saying, it was a
little bit simplistic for me.

48:02.413 --> 48:03.481
But it was beautiful.

48:04.648 --> 48:06.450
- I'm so mad.
- Me too.

48:06.450 --> 48:07.351
- You're so mad?

48:07.351 --> 48:09.153
- I'm mad.
- I'm mad.

48:09.153 --> 48:10.187
- Me too.

48:10.187 --> 48:11.222
- Well, you're wrong.

48:12.456 --> 48:13.724
(laughing)

48:13.724 --> 48:15.292
- Well, so is your hair, so
there we go.

48:15.292 --> 48:17.661
(laughing)

48:17.661 --> 48:19.230
- [Brooke Lynn] Gia Metric.

48:19.230 --> 48:20.831
- Considering where she came
from,

48:20.831 --> 48:23.501
and just bombing the
first design challenge,

48:23.501 --> 48:26.470
ending up with that
evening lounge wear chic

48:26.470 --> 48:29.673
bed Cinderella, just glorious.

48:29.673 --> 48:32.309
It was really great to
see how much she's grown.

48:32.309 --> 48:35.212
- I thought the looks
tonight were sensational.

48:35.212 --> 48:36.947
The sex, drugs, and rock and
roll.

48:36.947 --> 48:38.415
It was, again, a really clever
take,

48:38.415 --> 48:39.850
like she always does.

48:39.850 --> 48:43.220
I loved the ugly as sin look.

48:43.220 --> 48:45.723
- I thought that that was
one of the coolest things.

48:45.723 --> 48:47.992
I thought it was one of the most

48:47.992 --> 48:50.528
underrated looks of tonight.

48:50.528 --> 48:51.695
- Synthia Kiss.

48:51.695 --> 48:54.265
The sex, drugs, rock
and roll look, for me,

48:54.265 --> 48:57.168
was probably one of my
least favorite looks.

48:57.168 --> 49:00.471
Her sense of style is, it's
just not strong enough.

49:01.705 --> 49:04.241
- I'm going to disagree.

49:04.241 --> 49:06.143
On that first look, I enjoyed
it.

49:06.143 --> 49:08.179
I thought it was very, like, 70s
groupie.

49:08.179 --> 49:11.248
- 70s droopy is more like it.
(laughing)

49:11.248 --> 49:12.449
- Oh honey!

49:12.449 --> 49:15.686
- She looked so beautiful
in the ugly as sin look.

49:15.686 --> 49:18.823
It was her best look in
this entire competition.

49:18.823 --> 49:20.825
- Absolutely.
- Really bad timing.

49:20.825 --> 49:24.628
Her seven deadly sins look, it
was okay.

49:24.628 --> 49:27.898
But the top part, like
go with the animal print.

49:27.898 --> 49:29.934
You could be a movie star.

49:29.934 --> 49:33.571
Lean into that and away
from whatever this stuff is.

49:33.571 --> 49:35.172
- I agree with that.
- Yeah.

49:36.373 --> 49:38.876
- [Brooke Lynn] Finally, Kimora
Amour.

49:38.876 --> 49:41.478
- I walked away inspired
tonight,

49:41.478 --> 49:45.416
from just seeing her second
look.

49:45.416 --> 49:48.319
To transform pain into art,

49:48.319 --> 49:50.855
and to really captivate that on
a stage

49:50.855 --> 49:53.290
is just so powerful to me.

49:53.290 --> 49:56.327
- Ugly as sin, I thought,
was so compelling.

49:56.327 --> 49:58.596
- And what a way to use this
platform

49:58.596 --> 49:59.630
to get your message across,

49:59.630 --> 50:01.532
and what an important
message to get across.

50:01.532 --> 50:04.101
- She really wants to make
a difference, you know.

50:04.101 --> 50:05.836
She wants to use her drag

50:05.836 --> 50:08.572
as a way to create change,

50:08.572 --> 50:10.074
and I love that about her.

50:10.074 --> 50:11.308
- I also had fun with her.

50:11.308 --> 50:13.010
That Tina Turner look,
it could've been better,

50:13.010 --> 50:14.945
but I wanted to get up
there and dance with her.

50:14.945 --> 50:16.413
She sold it for me.

50:16.413 --> 50:19.049
- I actually really loved
her seven deadly sins look.

50:19.049 --> 50:21.585
The snake going around
her, all of the leaves.

50:21.585 --> 50:23.954
I thought it was very, very
thoughtful,

50:23.954 --> 50:26.390
and I enjoy seeing her on the
runway.

50:26.390 --> 50:29.126
- Always, there's that light
that radiates out of her.

50:29.126 --> 50:30.327
- And you're always a joy, too,

50:30.327 --> 50:31.495
no matter what you look like.

50:31.495 --> 50:32.897
- Go fuck yourself, Brad.

50:32.897 --> 50:34.298
(laughing)

50:34.298 --> 50:36.400
I think we've made our decision.

50:36.400 --> 50:38.569
Bring back our queens.

50:39.803 --> 50:40.804
(dramatic music)

50:40.804 --> 50:42.539
Welcome back, queens.

50:42.539 --> 50:44.141
We've made some decisions.

50:47.912 --> 50:48.846
Icesis Couture,

50:50.047 --> 50:52.950
this week, you really yanked our
chain.

50:53.851 --> 50:54.752
And we liked it.

50:58.255 --> 51:00.257
Con-drag-ulations!

51:00.257 --> 51:03.027
You are the winner of this
week's Maxi Challenge.

51:03.027 --> 51:03.861
- Yes!
(all clapping)

51:03.861 --> 51:06.563
- [Brooke Lynn] You've
won a $5000 cash prize

51:06.563 --> 51:09.300
courtesy of Palm Holdings.

51:09.300 --> 51:10.634
- Thank you so much.

51:11.568 --> 51:13.404
Thank you so much!

51:13.404 --> 51:14.638
(laughing)

51:14.638 --> 51:16.640
- You may move to the back of
the stage.

51:17.641 --> 51:22.646
- Ra ta ta ta ta ta!
(laughing)

51:22.980 --> 51:25.049
- Gia Metric, Kimora Amour.

51:26.216 --> 51:28.185
You are both safe.

51:29.153 --> 51:31.021
You may move to the back of the
stage.

51:31.021 --> 51:33.157
- Baby, I survived the Ball.

51:33.157 --> 51:35.693
I am safe to fight another day.

51:39.263 --> 51:40.097
- Synthia Kiss.

51:40.931 --> 51:43.000
We see your spark,

51:43.000 --> 51:45.869
but today, your runways missed
the mark.

51:48.005 --> 51:49.440
I'm sorry, my dear,

51:49.440 --> 51:50.975
but you are up for elimination.

51:53.577 --> 51:56.213
Pythia, you are safe.

51:57.147 --> 51:59.083
You may move to the back of the
stage.

51:59.083 --> 52:00.851
And great work this week.

52:00.851 --> 52:02.019
- Thank you, thank you.

52:06.657 --> 52:08.292
- Kendall Gender.

52:08.292 --> 52:10.394
We love your shine,

52:10.394 --> 52:13.163
but your looks today lack
polish.

52:15.032 --> 52:19.169
Adriana, you are a
queen with many talents.

52:19.169 --> 52:23.340
But on the runway, your
lust was a bit of a bust.

52:26.276 --> 52:27.111
Adriana,

52:28.912 --> 52:29.747
you are safe.

52:31.448 --> 52:33.884
You may move to the back of the
stage.

52:33.884 --> 52:35.686
(dramatic music)

52:35.686 --> 52:36.754
- I love you.

52:40.657 --> 52:41.892
- Kendall Gender,

52:41.892 --> 52:42.893
I'm sorry to say,

52:42.893 --> 52:45.696
but that means you are up for
elimination.

52:45.696 --> 52:46.597
- Okay.

52:46.597 --> 52:47.898
Fuck!

52:47.898 --> 52:50.601
Not only am I just lip syncing
for myself,

52:50.601 --> 52:53.437
but I'm also lip syncing
against my best friend.

52:54.671 --> 52:56.040
I love you.
- I love you too.

52:56.040 --> 52:57.674
I was prepared to lip sync.

52:57.674 --> 53:00.978
I am less prepared to
lip sync against Kendall.

53:00.978 --> 53:04.181
This is so, so very, very hard.

53:04.181 --> 53:07.151
- Two queens stand before us.

53:07.151 --> 53:08.419
Prior to tonight,

53:08.419 --> 53:10.888
you were asked to prepare
a lip sync performance

53:10.888 --> 53:13.157
of "Heaven" by DJ Sammy.

53:14.091 --> 53:16.026
This is your last chance

53:16.026 --> 53:17.694
to impress the judges,

53:17.694 --> 53:21.098
and save yourself from
elimination.

53:21.098 --> 53:23.467
(dramatic music)

53:23.467 --> 53:24.968
The time has come

53:25.803 --> 53:27.371
(thunder rumbling)

53:27.371 --> 53:31.708
for you to lip sync for your
life.

53:31.708 --> 53:33.410
- I am going to perform

53:33.410 --> 53:35.579
like this is my last performance

53:35.579 --> 53:37.815
in my entire drag career.

53:37.815 --> 53:40.217
- Kendall and I are
gonna put on a lip sync

53:40.217 --> 53:42.119
of a lifetime.

53:42.119 --> 53:42.953
- Good luck,

53:44.254 --> 53:45.589
and don't fuck it up.

We've made our decision.

56:23.814 --> 56:26.583
(dramatic music)

56:30.420 --> 56:32.923
Kendall Gender, shante you stay.

You may join the other queens.

- Thank you.

56:44.568 --> 56:45.669

56:45.669 --> 56:47.904
This may be a kiss goodbye,

star.

56:51.875 --> 56:53.777

56:53.777 --> 56:55.612
Now sashay away.

56:55.612 --> 56:58.115

you all

56:58.115 --> 57:00.083
from the bottom of my heart,

57:00.083 --> 57:02.619
for reinvigorating my love of
drag.

57:02.619 --> 57:06.323
This has been a life-changing
experience.

57:06.323 --> 57:08.191
And I just want to apologize,

57:08.191 --> 57:10.294
because this season is gonna get

57:10.294 --> 57:11.962
a little less pretty now that
I'm gone.

57:11.962 --> 57:14.564
(all laughing)

57:16.500 --> 57:17.334
- We love you.

57:18.635 --> 57:20.137
(dramatic music)

57:20.137 --> 57:22.239
- To summarize it in a word,

57:22.239 --> 57:24.808
it's been...bananas.

57:24.808 --> 57:27.511
(laughing)

57:27.511 --> 57:29.279

(dramatic music)

57:32.516 --> 57:33.350
- Hmm.

57:34.451 --> 57:37.054
This entire experience has been

57:38.555 --> 57:39.623
a thrill.

57:40.757 --> 57:45.228
I'm feeling really proud
of myself, to be honest.

57:46.530 --> 57:48.465
No regrets, #NoRegrets.

57:52.069 --> 57:53.503
- Con-drag-ulations.

57:53.503 --> 57:55.806
You live to slay another day.

57:55.806 --> 57:59.576
And remember, stay true
North strong and fierce.

58:20.664 --> 58:22.833
- We will be having a roast.

58:23.734 --> 58:25.335
- Feelings gonna be hurt!

58:25.335 --> 58:28.505
- The roast is gonna be
about the queen of the North.

58:28.505 --> 58:31.541
And I, like everyone,
assumed that meant Priyanka.

58:31.541 --> 58:32.776
(laughing)

58:32.776 --> 58:33.977
- Her face doesn't move.

58:33.977 --> 58:36.413
She's like, make me laugh.

58:36.413 --> 58:38.749
- I'm still waiting.
(laughing)

58:38.749 --> 58:40.050
- Is it done yet?

58:40.050 --> 58:42.919
- Oh my goodness, girl, you
showed up!

58:42.919 --> 58:44.321
- You knocked it out of the
park.

58:44.321 --> 58:46.523
- You finally were the person

58:46.523 --> 58:48.091
that we knew was in there.

58:48.091 --> 58:51.762
