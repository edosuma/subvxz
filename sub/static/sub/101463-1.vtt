WEBVTT

02:12.992 --> 02:14.526
Arthur Davis please.

02:14.559 --> 02:15.493
Who shall I say is calling?

02:15.527 --> 02:17.495
- Rory O'Hara.
- One moment.

02:22.301 --> 02:24.971
About fucking time!

02:25.972 --> 02:27.672
Hello, you old bastard.

02:27.706 --> 02:31.243
Hello, and how
are you, dear boy?

03:07.612 --> 03:09.814
Good morning, my darling.

03:12.952 --> 03:13.953
Thank you.

03:57.629 --> 03:59.564
All right, all right.

04:13.212 --> 04:14.280
Good morning.

04:22.821 --> 04:23.655
There you go.

04:23.688 --> 04:24.890
Thanks, Rory.

04:24.924 --> 04:25.991
Thanks Dad.

04:34.967 --> 04:37.036
You're disgusting.

04:40.172 --> 04:41.040
Knock it off.

04:52.885 --> 04:53.818
Have a good day, bub.

04:53.853 --> 04:55.020
See you later, Dad.

04:55.054 --> 04:56.688
Later shit-for-brains.

05:09.201 --> 05:11.103
Yesterday, President
Reagan announced

05:11.137 --> 05:12.670
that effective May 19th,

05:12.704 --> 05:14.173
quotas would be set on imports

05:14.206 --> 05:16.075
of chocolate,
apples, pear juice,

05:16.108 --> 05:17.709
and lower priced white wine,

05:17.742 --> 05:20.112
coming from members of
the European community.

05:20.146 --> 05:22.814
The US consumer will
no immediate.

05:38.898 --> 05:41.733
Bill, I know you'll figure
this out for me, thank you.

05:41.766 --> 05:42.434
Bye.

05:43.768 --> 05:44.837
Hi Margie.

05:44.870 --> 05:47.072
Hi Al, here's rent for me.

05:47.106 --> 05:48.040
I'm sorry it's a bit late.

05:48.073 --> 05:50.775
No problem, I told Joe
you'd be a little late.

05:52.211 --> 05:54.146
You also owe me directly
for two lessons,

05:54.180 --> 05:55.147
three after today.

05:56.315 --> 05:59.118
I have cash for the days
that I owe you already.

05:59.151 --> 06:00.019
That's fine.

06:05.823 --> 06:06.926
Watch your hands.

06:06.959 --> 06:09.828
Remember, your spine into
his spine, think forward.

06:11.096 --> 06:12.932
Keep going!

06:12.965 --> 06:16.035
Halt, halt, halt.

06:17.503 --> 06:20.472
Get your reins,
yeah yeah, walk on.

06:20.506 --> 06:21.373
Walk on.

06:25.010 --> 06:26.744
Get through that wall now,
look where you're going.

06:26.778 --> 06:27.446
Good.

06:29.114 --> 06:29.982
Better.

06:31.951 --> 06:33.986
Now what's your leg doing?

06:35.321 --> 06:38.424
Is it, is it squeezy?

06:41.894 --> 06:43.429
Beautiful.

06:57.509 --> 06:58.377
Yes!

07:03.449 --> 07:04.782
Yes!

07:04.816 --> 07:06.485
Nine-nine, next
goal wins old man.

07:07.386 --> 07:08.854
Old man.

07:08.887 --> 07:09.888
Yeah.

07:17.596 --> 07:20.532
Yes, champion of the house!

07:22.268 --> 07:23.801
10-nine.

07:23.836 --> 07:24.503
10-nine.

07:32.911 --> 07:34.146
staying for dinner?

07:34.179 --> 07:36.315
No thanks, I gotta get home.

07:38.150 --> 07:38.984
- Later.
- Later.

07:39.018 --> 07:39.885
Hi.

07:41.587 --> 07:43.255
Dad cheated.

07:43.289 --> 07:44.523
I didn't.

07:44.556 --> 07:45.424
I didn't.

08:44.516 --> 08:45.584
What is it?

08:48.153 --> 08:49.488
I think we need to move.

08:54.460 --> 08:55.594
There's an opportunity.

09:00.032 --> 09:00.899
Where?

09:02.501 --> 09:04.103
London.

09:04.136 --> 09:05.137
Go fuck yourself.

09:07.306 --> 09:09.141
Things are drying
up here, for me.

09:10.275 --> 09:11.243
What are you talking about?

09:11.276 --> 09:12.111
I thought things were great.

09:12.144 --> 09:13.545
Mm-mm, I'm running
out of options.

09:15.314 --> 09:16.582
But money's fine, right?

09:16.615 --> 09:18.250
Yeah.

09:18.283 --> 09:19.485
Right?

09:19.518 --> 09:20.386
Yeah.

09:21.653 --> 09:22.588
So?

09:22.621 --> 09:24.623
- Won't be soon.
- How soon?

09:26.291 --> 09:27.993
It's not your concern,
because I'll take care of it.

09:28.026 --> 09:29.928
It is my concern when you
wake me up in the morning

09:29.962 --> 09:31.330
and you tell me we need to move.

09:31.363 --> 09:34.366
I didn't say that, I said,
there's an opportunity.

09:34.400 --> 09:36.502
Arthur Davis has been in touch.

09:36.535 --> 09:39.371
He wants me to head up a
new division of his company.

09:39.405 --> 09:41.039
You want to go back to Arthur?

09:41.073 --> 09:42.541
It's not going back to Arthur.

09:42.574 --> 09:45.344
It's me, having my own
company, backed by Arthur.

09:45.377 --> 09:49.014
Look, London is
about to be booming.

09:50.249 --> 09:52.518
Regulations are changed,
the culture's changed.

09:54.253 --> 09:56.622
This is a chance to make
some real money again.

09:58.357 --> 10:00.559
We do this, it
changes everything.

10:00.592 --> 10:02.261
Stop, Rory I don't
want to change

10:02.294 --> 10:03.028
- everything.
- We'll build you

10:03.061 --> 10:04.029
- your own stables.
- Stop trying

10:04.062 --> 10:04.864
to sell me on it.

10:04.898 --> 10:05.998
I wouldn't have
to sell you on it,

10:06.031 --> 10:09.134
if you had some vision,
you're so fucking risk-averse.

10:12.337 --> 10:14.406
You shouldn't be working

10:14.440 --> 10:15.574
for someone else.

10:16.642 --> 10:17.509
Hmm?

10:19.144 --> 10:20.979
Be your own boss.

10:21.013 --> 10:22.181
Build your own place.

10:23.749 --> 10:25.083
Own your own horses.

10:26.418 --> 10:27.519
This'll be our fourth move

10:27.553 --> 10:29.421
- in 10 years.
- Don't look backwards,

10:29.455 --> 10:31.457
look forwards, this
is a fresh start.

10:31.490 --> 10:32.658
This was our fresh start.

10:32.691 --> 10:34.560
This was our permanent
move, remember?

10:34.593 --> 10:37.262
Well, things don't always
work out as planned.

10:37.296 --> 10:39.331
Things never work
out the way you plan.

10:41.033 --> 10:43.502
I moved back here for you,
to be near your family.

10:45.571 --> 10:46.972
It's not working for me.

10:50.709 --> 10:52.211
I don't know what else to say.

10:55.247 --> 10:57.249
For fuck's sake, Rory.

11:57.109 --> 11:57.743
Oh oh.

12:02.481 --> 12:03.515
Come on.

12:03.549 --> 12:05.117
Come on baby.

12:11.123 --> 12:11.790
All right.

12:53.298 --> 12:55.267
Something doesn't
feel right, Mom.

12:55.300 --> 12:58.604
Oh please, it's exciting.

12:58.637 --> 13:00.539
Most people never
get to live overseas,

13:00.572 --> 13:03.375
so just go with it okay,
don't worry so much.

13:03.408 --> 13:05.377
If I don't worry, nobody will.

13:06.311 --> 13:07.013
It's not your job to worry,

13:07.046 --> 13:07.981
you leave that to your husband.

13:08.014 --> 13:10.850
It scares me that you
actually think that.

13:10.883 --> 13:13.452
Why give yourself the
added stress, huh?

13:14.353 --> 13:16.154
You know it's taking
a toll on your face.

13:16.188 --> 13:17.422
No it is, you're too young...

13:17.456 --> 13:18.724
Okay Mom, thanks.

13:20.759 --> 13:21.793
You always try to make things

13:21.828 --> 13:23.261
more complicated than the are.

13:23.295 --> 13:25.130
I'm not the difficult one here.

13:26.465 --> 13:27.466
I know you're not.

13:28.935 --> 13:30.802
I'm just saying that
these are his decisions,

13:30.837 --> 13:33.305
and you just accept that,
and you will feel better.

13:33.338 --> 13:34.740
That's all I'm saying.

13:36.408 --> 13:37.342
Well it does worry me

13:37.376 --> 13:39.344
that he doesn't have
any family over there.

13:39.378 --> 13:40.046
It's not his fault.

13:40.079 --> 13:40.913
I'm not saying it's his fault,

13:40.947 --> 13:42.481
I'm just saying he
doesn't have any...

13:42.514 --> 13:43.348
It sounds like you are.

13:43.382 --> 13:44.516
People, I'm not, I'm just.

13:54.393 --> 13:55.427
I can't believe it.

13:56.428 --> 13:57.262
What?

13:57.295 --> 13:58.163
I actually might miss you.

14:04.569 --> 14:05.337
Of course you will baby,

14:05.370 --> 14:07.172
I'm your mama and
I'm a good time.

14:09.474 --> 14:10.342
Yeah.

14:57.589 --> 14:59.025
How about this?

14:59.058 --> 15:00.792
How about this?

15:00.827 --> 15:01.693
Hello.

15:02.962 --> 15:04.362
Love you so.

15:04.396 --> 15:07.499
Did you miss me, I missed you.

15:07.532 --> 15:08.500
How about this?

15:08.533 --> 15:09.634
Hi ya.

15:09.668 --> 15:10.569
How are you?

15:10.602 --> 15:11.570
I'm okay.

15:11.603 --> 15:13.472
Oh, excuse me please?

15:14.372 --> 15:15.942
Take a photo of
me and the family.

15:15.975 --> 15:16.808
Not a problem at all.

15:16.843 --> 15:17.676
It's that one there.

15:17.709 --> 15:18.610
Excellent.

15:21.580 --> 15:22.514
For smiles.

15:22.547 --> 15:24.616
That's lovely.

15:25.885 --> 15:26.718
- Fantastic.
- Thank you.

15:26.752 --> 15:28.320
Oh wait, Sam, Sam!

15:28.353 --> 15:29.021
Sam.

15:29.055 --> 15:30.622
You're missing the photograph.

15:32.324 --> 15:32.959
One more?

15:32.992 --> 15:33.825
Okay.

15:33.860 --> 15:34.726
Are you jet-lagged?

15:34.760 --> 15:36.428
A little bit, yeah.

15:36.461 --> 15:37.997
That's fine.

15:38.898 --> 15:39.832
Thank you very much.

15:39.866 --> 15:42.300
It needs work but it's
incredible isn't it?

15:42.969 --> 15:44.736
I paid the rent for the year,

15:44.770 --> 15:46.605
with the option to buy.

15:46.638 --> 15:50.709
Hey, these floorboards
were laid in the 1700's,

15:50.742 --> 15:52.044
when the place was remodeled.

15:52.078 --> 15:54.513
Still in perfect condition.

15:54.546 --> 15:55.948
Look at this,
Bean, look at this.

15:55.982 --> 15:58.784
This table, Elizabethan style,

15:58.817 --> 16:01.686
well over a hundred years old.

16:01.720 --> 16:03.688
And this is a good story,
the estate agent told me,

16:03.722 --> 16:05.357
it's always offered
to the person

16:05.390 --> 16:06.458
whoever takes over the lease,

16:06.491 --> 16:08.627
because it's so bloody big,

16:08.660 --> 16:10.963
it doesn't fit in most houses.

16:10.997 --> 16:12.564
This is beautiful.

16:12.597 --> 16:14.633
They don't make things
like this anymore.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.502
Yes Sam, that's all for you.

16:17.536 --> 16:18.370
Oh my God.

16:18.403 --> 16:19.038
Oh my God.

16:19.071 --> 16:19.906
Boring.

16:19.939 --> 16:21.339
Oh my God.

16:21.373 --> 16:22.041
Beg, beg, Sam.

16:25.845 --> 16:26.711
Secret door.

16:27.980 --> 16:31.416
Oh, Led Zeppelin, Led
Zeppelin stayed here

16:31.449 --> 16:33.920
while they were recording
one of their albums.

16:46.999 --> 16:49.367
Wait wait wait, you
haven't seen the best bit.

16:51.037 --> 16:52.404
Your own football pitch.

16:53.405 --> 16:54.073
Oh my God!

17:11.623 --> 17:14.425
I started planning
with the contractors.

17:14.459 --> 17:17.762
We're building a
six-stall stables,

17:17.796 --> 17:20.598
and an outdoor
school, right there.

17:21.700 --> 17:24.736
Everything here on the
property is perfect.

17:24.769 --> 17:26.404
Al, it's what we always wanted.

17:27.539 --> 17:28.875
What's the rent?

17:28.908 --> 17:30.809
Less than you think.

17:30.843 --> 17:31.878
Rory, it's too big.

17:31.911 --> 17:34.679
Well, we'll close the
doors on the empty rooms.

17:34.713 --> 17:35.882
We'll fill them eventually.

17:35.915 --> 17:37.083
We'll fill them with us.

17:38.184 --> 17:39.584
You'll love it.

18:17.390 --> 18:19.758
We'll go for lunch, and see
if there's any common ground.

18:19.791 --> 18:23.595
Look, you'll be the last
person I call every evening.

18:23.628 --> 18:26.798
I expect to be the first
person you call every morning.

18:26.832 --> 18:28.767
All right, love to Dorothy.

18:28.800 --> 18:29.668
Bye.

18:30.702 --> 18:32.905
I trained you well, Rory.

18:32.939 --> 18:34.173
Anything I've learned
that's worthwhile

18:34.206 --> 18:36.608
certainly didn't come from you.

18:36.641 --> 18:37.642
Who was that?

18:37.676 --> 18:38.543
Ed Taylor.

18:39.577 --> 18:40.679
Speaking to him directly?

18:40.712 --> 18:41.546
Of course.

18:41.579 --> 18:42.248
He loves me.

18:42.281 --> 18:45.784
Impressive, any other updates?

18:45.817 --> 18:47.153
Plenty.

18:47.186 --> 18:48.054
Chop chop.

18:51.723 --> 18:53.792
The prodigal son of
a bitch returns, eh?

18:53.825 --> 18:56.728
Oh my god, when
did you get so old?

18:57.796 --> 18:58.630
Come here.

18:58.663 --> 19:02.902
10 years.

19:02.935 --> 19:05.537
God, you took to America
well, didn't you?

19:05.570 --> 19:06.973
It's really good to see you.

19:07.006 --> 19:07.806
We'll catch up, probably soon.

19:07.840 --> 19:09.241
Yeah yeah yeah, when
you've got time.

19:09.275 --> 19:10.977
Hey hey I'll take my
two weeks and a season

19:11.010 --> 19:12.510
at your fish.

19:12.544 --> 19:13.245
Don't worry,

19:13.279 --> 19:14.847
this could be described al ego.

19:16.648 --> 19:19.718
They want to vilify
deregulation and privatization,

19:19.751 --> 19:21.921
but it's gonna show
the ordinary person

19:21.954 --> 19:23.923
how to expect more,
how to want more,

19:23.956 --> 19:26.524
how to be their own boss.

19:26.558 --> 19:30.262
In America, everyone believes
they can be anything.

19:30.296 --> 19:32.231
Here, you're supposed to settle

19:32.264 --> 19:33.665
for the station
you're born into.

19:33.698 --> 19:35.868
This country needs to
move with the times.

19:35.901 --> 19:39.038
And that is why
we've brought him in.

19:39.071 --> 19:41.841
Ruthless vision for the future.

19:41.874 --> 19:43.042
I'm sorry I went off on one.

19:43.075 --> 19:44.176
Not at all, Rory.

19:44.210 --> 19:45.810
You're in good company for it.

19:47.812 --> 19:49.714
The gentlemen has
taken care of it.

19:51.317 --> 19:52.584
Thank you.

19:52.617 --> 19:53.319
Thank you.

19:53.352 --> 19:55.921
Rory, you cheeky fucker.

20:58.750 --> 21:01.187
And she was like, it's
not a hawk, it's a howk.

21:02.855 --> 21:03.688
Literally.

21:03.721 --> 21:04.356
What is her name?

21:04.390 --> 21:05.357
Missus Jenkins.

21:05.391 --> 21:07.126
Well that's bullshit,
I'm gonna go down there

21:07.159 --> 21:08.294
- with you tomorrow morning.
- Don't be stupid woman,

21:08.327 --> 21:10.262
Sam can take care of herself.

21:10.296 --> 21:12.064
Yeah, I can handle it, Mom.

21:12.098 --> 21:14.033
Well, she can't speak
to you like that.

21:14.066 --> 21:14.900
Apparently she can.

21:14.934 --> 21:16.135
How's your school?

21:16.168 --> 21:17.136
You like it?

21:17.169 --> 21:18.736
Yeah, it's fine I guess.

21:18.770 --> 21:19.804
Best school around.

21:21.140 --> 21:23.741
A place I'd have dreamed
of going to at your age.

21:23.775 --> 21:24.844
I had to work very
hard to get you in,

21:24.877 --> 21:26.278
you're very lucky to be there.

21:27.847 --> 21:29.381
Yeah, it's great, all of it.

21:30.883 --> 21:32.885
I'm full, may I
please be excused?

21:32.918 --> 21:34.920
- Of course.
- Thank you.

21:36.989 --> 21:39.191
A little bit more?

22:10.923 --> 22:11.789
Hey?

22:21.000 --> 22:21.867
Hey, hey.

22:23.869 --> 22:24.736
Good boy.

22:33.778 --> 22:35.381
It's good to see you.

22:43.055 --> 22:46.091
Hey, could you take
a break please?

22:46.125 --> 22:47.426
You're distracting him.

22:47.459 --> 22:48.861
No no no no no.

22:48.894 --> 22:49.761
Go on.

22:57.469 --> 22:58.337
Thank you.

23:05.945 --> 23:06.811
Hey.

23:07.546 --> 23:08.414
Hi.

23:14.019 --> 23:15.020
Gorgeous animal.

23:18.190 --> 23:19.391
How is he?

23:19.425 --> 23:20.792
Fair.

23:20.825 --> 23:22.228
Yeah, he's fine,
he's a bit jumpy,

23:22.261 --> 23:23.929
but he just needs to run it off.

23:29.935 --> 23:31.971
Not so bad all this, is it?

23:32.004 --> 23:33.239
No, it's not so bad.

23:33.272 --> 23:34.306
Pardon?

23:34.340 --> 23:36.041
No, it isn't.

23:40.546 --> 23:42.780
I can't wait to show
you off, tonight.

24:20.119 --> 24:21.287
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

24:22.254 --> 24:26.558
Okay.

24:33.499 --> 24:34.433
God, God.

24:35.901 --> 24:36.568
Honey?

25:56.648 --> 25:57.851
This is Mister Donald Barker,

25:57.883 --> 26:01.286
this is Mister and Missus Rory
O'Hara just in from America.

26:01.320 --> 26:03.021
Rory, you're the man
of the hour, sir.

26:03.055 --> 26:04.223
Nice to finally meet you.

26:04.256 --> 26:05.290
Likewise Donald, likewise.

26:05.324 --> 26:07.593
My name is Allison, that
might have been confusing.

26:07.626 --> 26:09.395
Absolutely ravishing Allison,
it's lovely to meet you.

26:09.428 --> 26:11.530
You too, ravishing that is.

26:13.098 --> 26:13.932
So you're back here full time.

26:13.966 --> 26:15.000
Oh yes.

26:15.033 --> 26:16.935
I mean we'll always keep
our penthouse in New York.

26:16.969 --> 26:19.405
We've just bought a
beautiful farm, in Surrey,

26:19.438 --> 26:22.474
and we're thinking of a
pier de tare in Mayfair.

26:22.508 --> 26:24.376
You might ,
he's my estate agent,

26:24.410 --> 26:25.310
and he's brilliant.

26:25.344 --> 26:26.145
He will get you to
the head of the queue

26:26.178 --> 26:27.713
for the best
properties available.

26:27.746 --> 26:29.381
Honestly, that
would be fantastic.

26:29.415 --> 26:31.049
Really, thank you.

26:31.083 --> 26:31.750
So what did you do in America

26:31.784 --> 26:33.018
to make you so legendary here?

26:33.051 --> 26:34.119
Hardly legendary.

26:34.153 --> 26:35.120
Come on.

26:35.154 --> 26:38.957
Well I was with Salomon
trading oil till '79,

26:38.991 --> 26:41.126
and I got sick of
working for other people.

26:41.160 --> 26:42.561
I saw an opportunity.

26:46.031 --> 26:47.733
Patricia, my darling,

26:47.766 --> 26:51.570
might I just borrow the
lovely Allison for a moment?

26:51.603 --> 26:53.705
Certainly darling,
handle gently.

26:59.645 --> 27:03.382
The people we're just about
to meet, are unbearable.

27:03.415 --> 27:06.084
Patricia said we have
to invite everybody,

27:06.118 --> 27:07.186
or there will be talk.

27:07.219 --> 27:09.588
I don't give a damn, and
I wish she didn't either.

27:09.621 --> 27:12.090
If she didn't give a damn,
she wouldn't be here.

27:12.124 --> 27:13.525
That is true.

27:13.559 --> 27:16.495
We take the good with
the bad when we marry.

27:16.528 --> 27:18.530
Although I think
that's all changing.

27:18.564 --> 27:21.099
People seem to want
everything from their

27:21.133 --> 27:21.967
husbands and wives,

27:22.000 --> 27:24.736
and expect every
need to be fulfilled.

27:24.770 --> 27:27.272
Maybe that's why
there's so much divorce.

27:27.306 --> 27:29.141
Too much expectation.

27:29.174 --> 27:30.476
Well, I hope you're wrong.

27:30.509 --> 27:32.277
I think people
should want it all.

27:34.279 --> 27:35.247
Looking closer,

27:35.280 --> 27:38.350
you are young enough to
still be an idealist,

27:38.383 --> 27:39.485
but only just.

27:45.791 --> 27:47.459
You should probably go to bed.

27:49.261 --> 27:50.128
I'm not tired.

27:51.463 --> 27:54.099
Well, go get in your bed
and play with yourself.

27:55.133 --> 27:57.436
Just pretend to be sleeping
when they get back.

28:02.274 --> 28:03.308
Can I stay up here?

28:04.209 --> 28:05.277
This house scares me.

28:06.545 --> 28:08.380
Me too, very creepy
fuckin' place,

28:08.413 --> 28:10.382
but I need some privacy, okay?

28:12.184 --> 28:14.052
You're gonna need
privacy too one day,

28:14.086 --> 28:16.154
if you ever become
a real live boy.

28:18.357 --> 28:20.492
I'm worried you're returning
to your natural state

28:20.526 --> 28:22.528
of being a full-blown chimp.

28:24.196 --> 28:25.130
Shut up!

28:26.698 --> 28:28.066
Our mother is a liar Ben,

28:28.100 --> 28:30.068
haven't you figured
that out yet?

28:31.236 --> 28:33.105
You were born a monkey.

28:33.138 --> 28:34.573
She just doesn't
want to tell you.

28:34.606 --> 28:35.807
You're stupid.

28:38.377 --> 28:39.411
Get out.

28:40.579 --> 28:41.480
Go!

28:48.787 --> 28:49.655
Close the door.

29:25.390 --> 29:28.460
And I want to thank
my darling Patricia

29:29.428 --> 29:33.131
for making these such
memorable evenings.

29:34.366 --> 29:37.269
I also want to welcome home

29:37.302 --> 29:39.605
one of the most
talented men I know,

29:40.606 --> 29:41.573
Mister Rory O'Hara,

29:42.741 --> 29:46.612
who as a dangerously
ambitious young man,

29:46.645 --> 29:50.883
was my highest
earner in the pit,

29:50.917 --> 29:52.117
for many years,

29:52.952 --> 29:55.253
until he was tempted away

29:55.287 --> 29:57.689
by the American dream.

29:58.690 --> 30:00.392
It's true.

30:00.425 --> 30:05.430
Luckily for us, he got
tired chasing that dream,

30:06.331 --> 30:07.900
and wanted to come home.

30:09.601 --> 30:14.406
Rory called me about
six months ago,

30:14.439 --> 30:18.610
and asked if he could come
back in and work with us.

30:18.644 --> 30:20.646
He convinced me
that he was exactly

30:20.679 --> 30:25.684
the right blend of old
British, and new American,

30:28.420 --> 30:30.489
to take Davis Trading forward
into the.

30:51.944 --> 30:53.679
You've been quiet,
you were right.

30:53.712 --> 30:54.613
Well.

31:08.260 --> 31:10.729
What if I started
calling Patricia, Patty?

31:10.762 --> 31:11.630
Or Trish?

31:15.734 --> 31:17.569
God, the formality
makes me sick.

31:19.005 --> 31:21.473
Everything's easier in America.

31:21.506 --> 31:23.508
Why can't we just be American?

31:23.542 --> 31:24.977
All that Mister
and Missus nonsense

31:25.011 --> 31:26.778
is what I ran away from.

31:26.812 --> 31:29.581
Well, you're pretty
good at playing along.

31:30.449 --> 31:31.550
Am I?

31:31.583 --> 31:33.920
Well we kept the
penthouse in New York.

31:33.953 --> 31:37.355
The farm in Surrey, the
pier de tare in Mayfair.

31:38.356 --> 31:40.292
It's just small talk.

31:53.638 --> 31:54.506
Is it?

32:10.022 --> 32:11.790
I have to go into work.

32:11.823 --> 32:12.724
It's Saturday.

32:13.625 --> 32:18.630
I know, I'm sorry.

32:24.871 --> 32:27.874
Eh, I didn't think
I'd see you back here.

32:28.875 --> 32:31.077
Well you know America's tired.

32:31.110 --> 32:32.044
I needed a new challenge.

32:32.078 --> 32:33.345
Oh yeah yeah,

32:33.378 --> 32:34.479
well you know you're successful

32:34.513 --> 32:35.882
when you get tired of America.

32:38.784 --> 32:40.652
I'm happy.

32:40.685 --> 32:41.520
You aren't doing too badly,

32:41.553 --> 32:43.555
you've moved up
nicely at our office.

32:43.588 --> 32:44.991
It's been almost 20 years.

32:45.024 --> 32:46.058
Yeah 20 years.

32:47.759 --> 32:48.627
What are you working on?

32:48.660 --> 32:50.428
I'm just trying to
modify the company.

32:50.462 --> 32:51.463
See?

32:51.496 --> 32:52.531
Bringing in new business.

32:52.564 --> 32:55.433
Right, you're a better
man than me, thinking big.

32:55.467 --> 32:56.401
What about you, what
are you working?

32:56.434 --> 32:58.104
Norwegian fish farms.

32:58.137 --> 33:01.373
It's not bad, mostly
it's got potential.

33:01.406 --> 33:02.574
You make an offer yet?

33:02.607 --> 33:04.609
Well, I want to have
more in order first.

33:04.643 --> 33:07.947
It's not a huge profit up
front but, I don't know,

33:07.980 --> 33:10.116
it's got something,
you know what I mean?

33:10.149 --> 33:12.350
Yeah, now it's not, come on.

33:14.653 --> 33:15.554
Hey hey,

33:15.587 --> 33:18.423
what the fuck is your
problem, come on.

33:18.456 --> 33:19.324
No, no.

33:22.061 --> 33:23.562
Get up.

33:23.595 --> 33:26.531
Get up.

33:30.169 --> 33:31.938
Hey hey hey hey hey.

33:33.139 --> 33:34.006
Get on.

35:38.831 --> 35:39.664
The weather will continue to be

35:39.698 --> 35:42.101
a little wary

35:42.134 --> 35:45.137
although temperatures
should remain steady.

35:45.171 --> 35:47.940
Here's the Thompson
Twins, and "Hold me Now."

36:16.302 --> 36:17.470
I almost died lady.

36:17.502 --> 36:19.604
Let your brother take the
front, he's not feeling well.

36:19.637 --> 36:20.805
You know he gets carsick.

36:20.840 --> 36:21.740
Are you fucking kidding me?

36:21.773 --> 36:22.640
Sam.

36:37.023 --> 36:38.590
Hold on sweetie, I'll
write you a note.

36:38.623 --> 36:40.625
We're always late mom.

36:49.969 --> 36:52.637
Well I can deal with going
to the shitty school,

36:52.670 --> 36:54.206
but I can't deal with
being late every day.

36:54.240 --> 36:55.841
You won't be late every day.

36:55.875 --> 36:57.143
You will though.

36:57.176 --> 36:58.110
No I won't.

37:02.348 --> 37:04.283
I'm sorry, I know
this is hard for you.

37:06.986 --> 37:08.054
We'll figure it out.

37:08.988 --> 37:09.922
I know it's hard for you, too.

37:09.955 --> 37:11.090
It's not hard for me.

37:12.824 --> 37:13.691
Okay, Mom.

37:32.278 --> 37:33.879
Hello.

37:43.122 --> 37:43.989
Here now?

37:45.257 --> 37:46.125
Listening.

37:47.126 --> 37:49.128
Eshan Markham Industries.

37:49.161 --> 37:50.196
They're based out of Chicago.

37:50.229 --> 37:51.297
I know them well,

37:51.330 --> 37:53.099
did a lot with them on
natural gas in the Midwest.

37:53.132 --> 37:55.868
There's a good, strong shop,
good people, good vision.

37:59.238 --> 38:02.141
I think they're looking for
a London firm to merge with.

38:04.844 --> 38:06.946
I have 'em, I really have
'em in a very nice position,

38:06.979 --> 38:08.813
and I think you need to
listen to their offer.

38:08.848 --> 38:10.715
Why is that?

38:10.748 --> 38:12.118
Because I have a strong feeling

38:12.151 --> 38:13.986
you need to sell your company.

38:15.955 --> 38:18.124
And I thought you were
a commodities broker.

38:18.157 --> 38:19.425
Yeah, but I don't see markets,

38:19.458 --> 38:21.160
I see risk, reward, and money.

38:23.395 --> 38:24.263
Touche.

38:26.999 --> 38:29.335
A sale is a sale, an
opportunity is an opportunity.

38:29.368 --> 38:30.836
You taught me that.

38:30.870 --> 38:31.736
Did I?

38:33.205 --> 38:34.974
Okay, tell me more.

38:37.076 --> 38:39.278
The industry's been in a
downturn for almost a decade.

38:40.312 --> 38:41.147
By the end of the year,

38:41.180 --> 38:42.448
deregulation will
be in full effect,

38:42.481 --> 38:43.849
and London might
be the same again.

38:43.883 --> 38:45.384
And giant banks
and American firms

38:45.417 --> 38:46.952
will buy up all
your competitors,

38:46.986 --> 38:48.220
take the best bids from each,

38:48.254 --> 38:50.722
and make conglomerates you will
not be able to compete with.

38:50.755 --> 38:52.324
It'd be one thing if you
could offer them what,

38:52.358 --> 38:54.193
niche business, but you can't.

38:54.226 --> 38:56.694
You trade in agricultures
and energies.

38:57.729 --> 38:59.131
You don't have the
contracts the big boys want,

38:59.165 --> 39:00.199
so you'll be stuck
in the middle ground

39:00.232 --> 39:01.433
between specialist boutique,

39:01.467 --> 39:03.369
and well-capitalized
major player.

39:05.037 --> 39:07.840
Eshan Markham will quadruple
your size immediately

39:07.873 --> 39:10.976
and for good measure, this
is an interesting angle,

39:11.010 --> 39:12.211
I've been positioning
the partnership

39:12.244 --> 39:14.346
as a 24-hour global
trading firm.

39:16.882 --> 39:17.715
A few people have been doing it,

39:17.749 --> 39:19.418
but not in the way
it could be done.

39:19.451 --> 39:20.553
And on top of all of that,

39:20.586 --> 39:22.754
you'll never have to work
another day in your life.

39:22.787 --> 39:23.989
I already don't have to work

39:24.023 --> 39:24.857
another day in my life.

39:24.890 --> 39:26.025
Yeah, I know.

39:27.159 --> 39:28.194
You'll be able to get
that yacht you want,

39:28.227 --> 39:29.794
sailing off the Amalfi Coast.

39:33.432 --> 39:34.300
Well?

39:36.969 --> 39:37.970
I'll talk to them.

39:39.939 --> 39:41.073
All right.

39:41.106 --> 39:42.007
All right.

39:42.041 --> 39:43.509
They move fast, they
think we move slow,

39:43.542 --> 39:45.377
so let's change
their perception.

39:45.411 --> 39:47.346
Get this started
with some urgency.

39:48.380 --> 39:49.949
I'll see what I can do.

39:51.083 --> 39:51.951
Good.

40:37.096 --> 40:40.499
Fucking did it, I just got
off the phone, Arthur's in.

40:40.532 --> 40:42.034
Whoa whoa he's in, or he's...

40:42.067 --> 40:43.402
He sent it to legal to evaluate.

40:43.435 --> 40:44.870
It's happening, it's
gonna fucking happen.

40:44.903 --> 40:46.272
It's too good not to.

40:46.305 --> 40:47.172
So I'm out of a job?

40:47.206 --> 40:49.875
I'm out of a job,
we're gonna be rich!

40:49.908 --> 40:51.076
No no no no, I can't just yet.

40:51.110 --> 40:52.845
I'm needing hours.

40:52.878 --> 40:53.778
Come have lunch,

40:53.811 --> 40:54.913
your work will be here
when you get back.

40:54.947 --> 40:57.249
You know if I wasn't so
starved I wouldn't come back.

40:57.283 --> 40:59.184
Then don't come back.

42:05.050 --> 42:05.884
Hello?

42:05.918 --> 42:06.885
Dave, it's Allison.

42:08.587 --> 42:10.022
Oh hello.

42:10.055 --> 42:10.989
What's going on?

42:11.023 --> 42:13.225
I haven't seen your guys
here in over a week.

42:13.258 --> 42:15.327
We haven't been paid.

42:15.361 --> 42:16.562
What?

42:16.595 --> 42:17.529
That check bounced.

42:17.563 --> 42:18.897
Your husband said he
posted us another one,

42:18.931 --> 42:20.399
but that never arrived.

42:20.432 --> 42:22.267
And now he's not
returning my calls.

42:23.235 --> 42:24.570
Well, what are you
calling him for?

42:24.603 --> 42:26.105
You should have called me.

42:26.138 --> 42:28.907
I'll get you the check,
how much are you owed?

42:28.941 --> 42:31.410
2,800 pounds for
labor and materials.

42:33.379 --> 42:35.247
Okay, I'll work on
getting you that check.

42:35.280 --> 42:36.181
But in the meantime,

42:36.215 --> 42:37.549
can you guys come
down and keep working?

42:37.583 --> 42:39.151
I need this place finished.

42:39.184 --> 42:40.085
No, I'm sorry.

42:40.119 --> 42:40.819
We can't work again
until we're paid up.

42:40.854 --> 42:42.688
I owe my lads two weeks' wages,

42:42.721 --> 42:45.157
and I'm out of pocket
on the timber costs

42:45.190 --> 42:46.592
specifically for your stables.

42:49.328 --> 42:51.930
Yeah okay, I'll work it
out, thanks, goodbye.

43:18.657 --> 43:21.193
These on the square
don't come around often.

43:21.226 --> 43:22.461
Since you're a
friend of Donald's

43:22.494 --> 43:25.497
I moved you to the top of my
list, but we need to move fast.

43:26.498 --> 43:29.268
My concern is it's only
got three bedrooms.

43:29.301 --> 43:30.436
Yes, but as a second residence

43:30.469 --> 43:31.970
it stands to work out fine.

43:33.672 --> 43:34.540
Of course.

43:37.042 --> 43:39.144
Can me and my wife
have a moment alone?

43:39.178 --> 43:40.479
Please do, take your time.

43:49.021 --> 43:51.023
We can't afford to
furnish the house we have.

43:51.056 --> 43:52.458
Of course we can.

43:52.491 --> 43:53.459
We just haven't gotten
around to it yet.

43:53.492 --> 43:55.594
I just went to the bank, Rory.

43:57.229 --> 43:59.298
We have 600 pounds left.

44:06.505 --> 44:08.640
Well, I paid our rent.

44:10.342 --> 44:12.044
I paid for Ben's school.

44:12.077 --> 44:14.379
I bought you a car,
I bought you a horse.

44:14.413 --> 44:16.415
I paid for construction
on your barn.

44:16.448 --> 44:17.616
I spoke to Dave,
the check bounced.

44:17.649 --> 44:20.619
He said you were sending him
another one and you didn't.

44:21.553 --> 44:24.156
I will when I get
paid again, Allison.

44:24.189 --> 44:25.290
And when's that?

44:26.792 --> 44:27.726
Yeah, just talking.

44:27.759 --> 44:28.627
I don't want to rush you.

44:28.660 --> 44:31.029
We're done here, we
aren't interested.

44:39.638 --> 44:41.373
I have a huge check coming
in at the end of the month,

44:41.406 --> 44:44.343
and stop worrying about
this, once and for all.

44:47.779 --> 44:48.680
Really Rory, at the
end of the month?

44:48.714 --> 44:51.049
Before the end of the
month, in 10 days.

44:53.385 --> 44:54.520
What's it for?

44:54.553 --> 44:56.021
Don't worry, it's coming.

44:58.624 --> 44:59.825
I saw some deposits you made,

44:59.859 --> 45:01.326
it's nowhere near
what you're spending.

45:01.360 --> 45:03.161
It's taking time, it takes time.

45:04.229 --> 45:07.165
It's coming.

45:07.199 --> 45:10.035
This next payment is the one.

45:13.105 --> 45:14.406
All right, well if you
have all this money

45:14.439 --> 45:15.440
coming in 10 days,

45:15.474 --> 45:17.109
then you can buy me dinner,

45:17.142 --> 45:18.710
and we can order
whatever we want.

45:21.480 --> 45:22.314
Of course.

45:22.347 --> 45:23.215
Of course.

45:27.486 --> 45:28.787
Are you ready to order sir?

45:28.820 --> 45:30.088
Yeah, I think so.

45:30.122 --> 45:31.523
We'll start with
a dozen oysters,

45:31.557 --> 45:33.625
and the shrimp cocktail.

45:33.659 --> 45:35.394
And the princess will
have the chateaubriand,

45:35.427 --> 45:37.462
and I'll do the whole
roasted sea bass.

45:37.496 --> 45:38.397
Let's start with
a bottle of white,

45:38.430 --> 45:39.832
and then we'll have
red with our dinner,

45:39.866 --> 45:42.568
whatever you think goes
best with our food.

45:42.601 --> 45:45.470
Don't look at him, I've told
you what we wanted, thank you.

45:52.711 --> 45:54.613
You're embarrassing.

45:54.646 --> 45:56.049
And you're exhausting.

46:00.185 --> 46:03.188
How?

46:03.221 --> 46:05.424
Everything's gonna be fine.

46:13.332 --> 46:14.433
Don't give it her,

46:14.466 --> 46:16.668
she hasn't got the faintest
fucking clue about wine.

46:28.580 --> 46:30.282
It's fine, we'll take it.

46:30.315 --> 46:31.183
Oh fuck.

47:21.433 --> 47:24.469
You're sleeping, I'll
take the kids to school.

47:24.503 --> 47:25.872
And then I'll drive
myself into town.

47:30.275 --> 47:31.643
I won't have a car all day.

47:33.578 --> 47:34.579
Whatever you want.

47:35.781 --> 47:38.784
I wanted to offer, so you
could have a lie-in for once.

47:41.888 --> 47:43.422
That's okay, I'll take 'em.

47:45.390 --> 47:46.258
Thanks.

47:54.000 --> 47:55.968
Al, I need some money,

47:56.002 --> 47:57.837
just to get me through
the next couple of weeks.

47:59.939 --> 48:00.806
No.

48:01.807 --> 48:02.875
Our account's empty.

48:03.843 --> 48:04.710
I need it.

48:07.947 --> 48:09.448
Well that's your problem.

48:11.783 --> 48:13.986
A few hundred pounds
Al, don't make me beg.

48:18.757 --> 48:21.259
Thought you had a
big check coming in?

48:21.293 --> 48:21.961
The one.

48:21.994 --> 48:22.862
It's coming.

48:27.599 --> 48:30.302
10 days came and went a
few times over didn't it?

48:30.335 --> 48:31.770
Well, it takes time.

48:33.805 --> 48:34.874
Stand outside.

48:41.646 --> 48:42.514
Really?

49:34.066 --> 49:38.070
No, no, no, no.

49:38.104 --> 49:38.971
Rear up.

49:39.972 --> 49:40.840
That's it.

50:10.769 --> 50:12.671
What's up, huh?

50:12.704 --> 50:14.773
What's wrong, sweetheart?

50:16.474 --> 50:17.542
Max Price, please.

50:18.543 --> 50:21.047
Rory O'Hara.

50:24.449 --> 50:25.817
I've already left three
messages this week.

50:25.852 --> 50:27.519
Is he really gonna call me back?

50:28.653 --> 50:30.056
No don't tell me he's
gonna call me back,

50:30.089 --> 50:32.091
tell me why he's not
returning my calls.

50:33.860 --> 50:35.427
Hello.

50:35.460 --> 50:36.128
Fuck.

50:44.736 --> 50:45.604
Hey.

50:47.672 --> 50:48.540
Richmond?

50:55.547 --> 50:56.681
It's okay.

50:56.715 --> 50:57.716
It's okay, sweetheart.

50:57.749 --> 50:58.617
It's okay.

50:59.886 --> 51:01.753
It's okay, we got you.

51:05.091 --> 51:06.424
Okay?

51:06.458 --> 51:07.960
Just hold on, huh?

51:07.994 --> 51:09.195
Huh?

51:09.228 --> 51:10.096
It's okay.

51:11.463 --> 51:12.797
It's okay, honey.

51:14.233 --> 51:15.101
It's okay.

51:37.023 --> 51:39.524
Please, Rory please.

51:39.557 --> 51:40.625
Please, please, please.

51:44.830 --> 51:46.098
Hello?

51:46.132 --> 51:46.966
What's going on?

51:46.999 --> 51:48.733
I haven't heard
back from Max Price.

51:48.767 --> 51:50.769
We pulled out at the
end of last week.

51:52.637 --> 51:53.638
What?

51:53.672 --> 51:55.074
Yeah, I didn't like the terms.

51:55.107 --> 51:56.775
What fucking terms
didn't you like?

51:56.808 --> 51:57.776
Excuse me?

51:57.809 --> 51:58.844
Why didn't you tell me?

51:58.878 --> 52:01.479
It happened last Friday.

52:01.513 --> 52:02.181
I could have fixed it,

52:02.214 --> 52:03.581
why didn't you let me fix it?

52:03.615 --> 52:06.152
There was nothing to fix, Rory.

52:06.185 --> 52:07.752
It just wasn't a good fit.

52:07.786 --> 52:10.990
Arthur, I had everything
riding on this deal.

52:12.757 --> 52:14.793
Arthur, I need the deal.

52:15.794 --> 52:16.761
What are you going on about?

52:16.795 --> 52:17.595
I don't care what you need.

52:17.629 --> 52:19.832
This is my company,
just move on.

52:19.865 --> 52:22.101
You're killing your company
by not listening to me.

52:22.134 --> 52:23.869
So small-minded.

52:24.769 --> 52:26.939
Jesus, that's why I had
to get away from here,

52:26.973 --> 52:29.075
small island, small
fucking mentality.

52:29.108 --> 52:31.911
Watch your mouth in
my office, Sonny Jim.

52:33.212 --> 52:35.982
Did you have any idea what
we were going to do here?

52:36.015 --> 52:36.949
Shit.

52:36.983 --> 52:39.251
Did you even bother to
look at the details?

52:39.285 --> 52:42.121
Or were you too
busy celebrating?

52:42.154 --> 52:43.688
There wasn't a chance in hell

52:43.722 --> 52:45.657
I was gonna let
them come in here

52:45.690 --> 52:47.293
and fuck with what I've built.

52:47.326 --> 52:50.129
None of that matters, the
bottom line is what matters.

52:50.162 --> 52:52.664
You brought me in,
to make you money.

52:52.697 --> 52:53.531
Right?

52:53.565 --> 52:54.699
You brought me in
to make you money,

52:54.733 --> 52:57.236
and the best way to make
money is to sell the company.

52:57.269 --> 52:58.636
Make the deal.

53:05.011 --> 53:05.878
I've known you a long
time you little bastard.

53:08.981 --> 53:11.017
So I'm gonna be honest with you.

53:11.951 --> 53:15.154
You have a great mind,
and endless charm,

53:15.187 --> 53:19.058
but you don't pay
attention to the detail.

53:20.059 --> 53:22.594
I thought you'd changed,
but you haven't.

53:22.627 --> 53:27.066
Oh, you know how to ride
a wave in an up market.

53:27.099 --> 53:28.934
Well that doesn't impress.

53:28.968 --> 53:33.671
What impresses me, is how
you deal with a down market,

53:33.705 --> 53:36.641
because that's how you
build a successful company.

53:36.674 --> 53:39.879
You focus on the one
percent at a time.

53:41.080 --> 53:43.115
It's boring and it's ugly.

53:44.350 --> 53:47.752
But it's the bit of the
business I love the most.

53:47.786 --> 53:49.221
There won't be any business,

53:49.255 --> 53:50.189
there won't be any company.

53:50.222 --> 53:52.091
We'll be finished within a year.

53:52.124 --> 53:54.960
And we can have all the
information in the world,

53:54.994 --> 53:56.628
and still be wrong.

54:01.000 --> 54:02.001
Come on.

54:02.034 --> 54:04.270
Get back to trading, Rory.

54:04.303 --> 54:05.637
You're good at it.

54:05.670 --> 54:07.106
Very good at it.

54:09.375 --> 54:12.710
For Christ's sake,
do yourself a favor,

54:13.711 --> 54:16.048
and stop trying to make
a killing overnight.

54:18.417 --> 54:19.852
Bring me something stable.

54:20.886 --> 54:25.891
Find solid footing
on some good deals.

54:29.328 --> 54:31.130
There is something.

54:31.163 --> 54:32.231
Oh.

54:32.264 --> 54:33.731
I wasn't gonna say it
until it was further along,

54:33.765 --> 54:35.301
but I might as
well tell you now.

54:35.334 --> 54:36.701
Yeah.

54:36.734 --> 54:37.870
Norwegian fish farms.

54:56.288 --> 54:57.223
Excuse me!

54:57.256 --> 54:58.924
Are you all right?

54:58.958 --> 55:00.426
I'm sorry to bother you.

55:00.459 --> 55:03.129
I live up the road, but
I really need some help.

55:07.032 --> 55:07.900
I'm sorry.

55:11.036 --> 55:11.904
Oh Jesus.

55:13.005 --> 55:18.010
Oh no.

55:35.928 --> 55:36.962
I'm sorry, Beanie.

55:39.265 --> 55:41.666
Is it all right if you don't
call me Beanie anymore?

55:44.802 --> 55:45.670
Sure.

55:54.180 --> 55:55.780
I'm sorry.

55:55.813 --> 55:57.216
Don't be sorry, hon.

56:58.944 --> 57:00.346
She might have
taken the bus home.

57:00.379 --> 57:02.615
I wish she'd tell
me ahead of time.

57:06.485 --> 57:09.888
Are you upset
because I asked you

57:09.922 --> 57:11.023
not to call me Beanie?

57:12.157 --> 57:13.525
Oh God no, sweetheart.

57:17.429 --> 57:18.497
Richmond died today.

57:21.867 --> 57:22.534
How?

57:24.536 --> 57:25.371
I don't know, I
think he was sick

57:25.404 --> 57:26.839
and I didn't realize it.

57:46.091 --> 57:49.561
Jesus, Samantha the horse died.

57:51.263 --> 57:52.298
Please tell me if you're
not gonna be there

57:52.331 --> 57:53.499
when I come to pick you up.

57:53.532 --> 57:55.034
Can you tell me if
you're gonna be late?

57:55.067 --> 57:56.302
Oh go to hell.

57:57.236 --> 57:59.538
Let's just say, I get
myself home from now on?

58:01.974 --> 58:04.376
Be nice to her, Richmond died.

58:06.378 --> 58:07.246
What?

58:09.014 --> 58:09.882
Mom.

01:01:23.609 --> 01:01:24.476
Yes?

01:01:30.215 --> 01:01:32.050
Is that you?

01:01:32.084 --> 01:01:33.619
Yeah, it's me Mom.

01:01:35.621 --> 01:01:37.089
Well you might have called.

01:01:37.122 --> 01:01:38.590
How did you know I'd be in?

01:01:38.624 --> 01:01:40.225
I'd have waited.

01:01:42.528 --> 01:01:43.662
Can I come in?

01:02:00.279 --> 01:02:01.146
How's Ron?

01:02:03.315 --> 01:02:04.283
Do you care?

01:02:05.450 --> 01:02:06.618
How's Ron, Mom?

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:09.488
Same old, really.

01:02:12.357 --> 01:02:14.126
You could call him, you know.

01:02:16.595 --> 01:02:17.629
Does he have kids?

01:02:18.697 --> 01:02:20.532
Two, Gail's.

01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:22.601
Did you see 'em?

01:02:24.136 --> 01:02:25.771
The oldest is just
like her mother,

01:02:25.804 --> 01:02:27.639
and I couldn't stand her.

01:02:27.673 --> 01:02:29.374
But the little one is a darling.

01:02:30.309 --> 01:02:31.810
I see her quite often.

01:02:31.844 --> 01:02:35.714
But less so now, since
she left poor Ron.

01:02:35.747 --> 01:02:37.549
What happened?

01:02:37.583 --> 01:02:40.452
Wives ask questions they
don't want the answers to.

01:02:42.321 --> 01:02:43.722
Not like in your day, right?

01:02:46.224 --> 01:02:48.360
Well I didn't need
to ask questions.

01:02:49.361 --> 01:02:51.530
I knew your father inside out.

01:02:53.765 --> 01:02:54.633
Bless him.

01:02:59.404 --> 01:03:00.272
Bless him.

01:03:05.310 --> 01:03:08.848
So, what happened to America?

01:03:11.851 --> 01:03:14.553
I came back to open
a London office.

01:03:15.922 --> 01:03:18.590
I bought a beautiful
house in Surrey.

01:03:18.624 --> 01:03:19.892
Oh.

01:03:19.926 --> 01:03:21.727
You should come and visit.

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:24.663
Well I don't know, I
hadn't been invited.

01:03:24.696 --> 01:03:25.764
I just invited you.

01:03:27.265 --> 01:03:28.467
I have a family now, Mom.

01:03:29.501 --> 01:03:30.402
My wife's name's Allison,

01:03:30.435 --> 01:03:32.771
she's a beautiful
blonde American girl.

01:03:32.804 --> 01:03:33.672
Oh.

01:03:34.941 --> 01:03:36.241
You have a grandson.

01:03:38.276 --> 01:03:38.911
Do I?

01:03:38.945 --> 01:03:39.811
Benjamin.

01:03:41.413 --> 01:03:42.280
He's 10.

01:03:43.749 --> 01:03:45.384
He's 10?

01:03:45.417 --> 01:03:49.521
Look, here's a picture of
us in front of the house.

01:03:49.554 --> 01:03:51.356
You can see there's
plenty of room.

01:03:54.826 --> 01:03:56.261
How would I get there?

01:03:56.294 --> 01:03:58.263
I'll come and collect
you from the train.

01:03:58.296 --> 01:04:00.833
Or I'd send a car, or
I'd come and get you,

01:04:00.867 --> 01:04:02.668
I don't know, we'd
work it all out.

01:04:04.603 --> 01:04:06.271
I'd have to think about it.

01:04:06.304 --> 01:04:07.840
But I don't think so.

01:04:08.975 --> 01:04:10.742
I'd really like you
to get to know Ben.

01:04:10.776 --> 01:04:13.378
Come and stay at the house.

01:04:13.412 --> 01:04:15.614
I've missed so much,
what's the point?

01:04:15.647 --> 01:04:17.616
The point is,

01:04:17.649 --> 01:04:19.919
I'm inviting you
to be in my life.

01:04:19.952 --> 01:04:23.388
I shouldn't need to be
invited into your life.

01:04:24.289 --> 01:04:26.993
I'm your mother,
his grandmother.

01:04:27.026 --> 01:04:28.694
He won't even know who I am.

01:04:28.727 --> 01:04:30.696
It's not like you
called me, is it?

01:04:30.729 --> 01:04:33.298
I can't keep up, can I?

01:04:33.331 --> 01:04:35.400
Gallivanting all over the place.

01:06:04.623 --> 01:06:05.490
Sam?

01:06:06.959 --> 01:06:07.826
Ben?

01:06:12.697 --> 01:06:13.565
Samantha?

01:06:17.569 --> 01:06:18.436
Benjamin?

01:06:19.138 --> 01:06:20.572
Why are you yelling?

01:06:20.605 --> 01:06:22.074
Did you just go outside?

01:06:22.108 --> 01:06:22.975
No.

01:06:23.876 --> 01:06:25.044
Ben?

01:06:25.077 --> 01:06:25.978
No.

01:06:26.012 --> 01:06:27.079
I locked the front door.

01:06:27.113 --> 01:06:28.814
I walked around and I
checked all the other doors,

01:06:28.848 --> 01:06:30.883
and when I came back
the door was open.

01:06:30.917 --> 01:06:32.051
I didn't touch it, Mom.

01:06:32.084 --> 01:06:33.718
Me neither.

01:06:33.752 --> 01:06:35.687
Are you fucking with me, Sam?

01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:36.989
Fucking with you?

01:06:37.023 --> 01:06:39.558
I don't know why you're so
angry with me right now.

01:06:39.591 --> 01:06:40.592
What are you talking about?

01:06:40.625 --> 01:06:42.061
I'm not angry, you're angry.

01:06:42.094 --> 01:06:43.495
I'm not angry.

01:06:43.528 --> 01:06:45.965
You just say you're
not, but you are.

01:06:45.998 --> 01:06:47.033
Just admit it.

01:06:48.067 --> 01:06:49.068
What is happening?

01:06:50.769 --> 01:06:53.805
You're all strangers to
me right now, all of you.

01:06:55.041 --> 01:06:56.408
Okay.

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:02.547
Hi.

01:07:03.682 --> 01:07:04.549
Hey Dad.

01:07:16.561 --> 01:07:18.430
You want me to tuck you in?

01:07:18.463 --> 01:07:19.098
I'll come up in a minute.

01:07:19.131 --> 01:07:19.999
Okay.

01:07:42.487 --> 01:07:43.588
Are you gonna tell
me the next time

01:07:43.622 --> 01:07:45.423
you plan on spending
the night out?

01:07:48.094 --> 01:07:50.695
I slept at the office
'cause I was working late.

01:07:52.497 --> 01:07:53.565
Will this be a regular thing?

01:07:53.598 --> 01:07:54.733
If I need it to be.

01:08:01.606 --> 01:08:04.010
Actually I did call, but
the phone's disconnected.

01:08:04.944 --> 01:08:07.479
Why didn't you
pay the bill, hmm?

01:08:08.747 --> 01:08:10.883
First of all, you never
asked me to pay it.

01:08:10.917 --> 01:08:12.852
Second of all, with
what money, Rory?

01:08:12.885 --> 01:08:14.719
You have money, use it.

01:08:14.753 --> 01:08:15.988
I do not have the money.

01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:19.457
Fuck.

01:08:19.491 --> 01:08:20.158
See,

01:08:23.895 --> 01:08:25.563
Richmond died yesterday.

01:08:26.798 --> 01:08:27.666
What?

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:30.937
He just collapsed underneath me,

01:08:30.970 --> 01:08:32.737
and he started seizing,
and he couldn't breathe,

01:08:32.770 --> 01:08:35.540
and I had to get a
farmer from down the road

01:08:35.573 --> 01:08:36.640
to come and shoot him.

01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:39.211
Fuck.

01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:44.816
Fuck, that fucking cunt!

01:08:46.185 --> 01:08:47.086
What?

01:08:47.118 --> 01:08:49.787
That fucking cunt
sold me a sick horse.

01:08:49.821 --> 01:08:53.658
Fuck, I wasted five grand
on a faulty fucking horse.

01:08:53.692 --> 01:08:54.626
Faulty?

01:08:55.727 --> 01:08:57.696
It's not a car.

01:08:57.729 --> 01:08:59.764
He was a living, breathing,
animal and he died.

01:08:59.798 --> 01:09:00.799
We need to find
out what killed him

01:09:00.832 --> 01:09:02.935
so I can fucking sue her.

01:09:02.969 --> 01:09:03.935
You're not gonna sue anyone.

01:09:03.970 --> 01:09:05.569
Hey, it's my money.

01:09:05.603 --> 01:09:08.506
I paid for it, I want answers.

01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:09.442
What did the vet say?

01:09:09.474 --> 01:09:11.676
I didn't call the vet,
I just buried him.

01:09:11.710 --> 01:09:14.746
Oh well you really fucked
this up, didn't you?

01:09:14.779 --> 01:09:16.814
Maybe you really fucked this up.

01:09:16.849 --> 01:09:18.984
Maybe you killed him
by shipping him here.

01:09:19.018 --> 01:09:21.120
He was probably hurt
in the transport.

01:09:21.153 --> 01:09:22.955
Or maybe it's this
poisonous fucking house,

01:09:22.988 --> 01:09:24.090
there's probably
lead in the water.

01:09:24.122 --> 01:09:25.858
There's nothing wrong with
this house, nor the water.

01:09:25.890 --> 01:09:28.593
Everything is wrong
with this house.

01:09:28.626 --> 01:09:30.863
It's horrible here, no
one is the same here.

01:09:30.895 --> 01:09:31.729
- There's nothing wrong...
- Nothing is the same here.

01:09:31.763 --> 01:09:32.731
...with this house.

01:09:32.764 --> 01:09:35.067
You need to call the vet
and get him out here.

01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:36.801
Well you weren't here,
so you don't get a say,

01:09:36.836 --> 01:09:37.769
and now it's done.

01:09:37.801 --> 01:09:40.738
No I was working late
making money for us.

01:09:42.008 --> 01:09:44.609
For us, for us?

01:09:44.642 --> 01:09:45.643
It's not for us.

01:09:46.312 --> 01:09:47.846
It's so you can go
to fancy parties

01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:49.714
and tell people we have horses.

01:09:49.747 --> 01:09:50.615
It's so you can tell people

01:09:50.648 --> 01:09:52.917
that your son goes
to the best school.

01:09:52.952 --> 01:09:54.652
You're a poor kid,
pretending to be rich,

01:09:54.686 --> 01:09:56.788
and you don't give a fuck
about anybody but yourself.

01:09:56.821 --> 01:09:58.290
When I found you,
you were desperate,

01:09:58.324 --> 01:09:59.824
living with your daughter

01:09:59.859 --> 01:10:02.161
in a shitty little
one-bedroom flat,

01:10:02.194 --> 01:10:04.729
and you, you love being
able to suddenly afford

01:10:04.763 --> 01:10:06.999
a big house and nice
dinners, and nice clothes,

01:10:07.033 --> 01:10:08.901
so don't tell me
this is all for me.

01:10:08.934 --> 01:10:09.768
Well, look at me now,

01:10:09.801 --> 01:10:12.071
living in this
shitty, fucking dirty

01:10:12.104 --> 01:10:13.571
broken down mansion?

01:10:14.806 --> 01:10:15.875
I don't want any of it.

01:10:15.908 --> 01:10:17.076
Oh we'll figure it out.

01:10:21.947 --> 01:10:23.049
But it's all gone.

01:10:23.082 --> 01:10:25.051
I used that cash to bail us out,

01:10:25.084 --> 01:10:27.053
so we could move and
start all over again,

01:10:27.086 --> 01:10:28.054
and I'm tired.

01:10:28.087 --> 01:10:29.355
Right, I take risks.

01:10:29.388 --> 01:10:31.689
Sometimes I'm up, and
sometimes I'm down.

01:10:31.723 --> 01:10:32.892
That's who I am,

01:10:32.925 --> 01:10:33.859
Allison, okay?

01:10:33.893 --> 01:10:35.061
And you know what?

01:10:35.094 --> 01:10:37.662
For the first time in years,
I feel good, I feel myself,

01:10:37.695 --> 01:10:40.799
because in the states I
was pretending for you,

01:10:40.833 --> 01:10:42.301
and I'm not doing that anymore.

01:10:43.269 --> 01:10:44.970
Here, I feel worthwhile.

01:10:45.004 --> 01:10:47.772
I feel powerful, I feel
fucking invincible.

01:10:47.806 --> 01:10:48.773
Well, you're delusional then,

01:10:48.807 --> 01:10:51.277
because you have nothing
Rory, we have nothing.

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:56.148
And who's it for?

01:10:56.182 --> 01:10:58.084
We don't have any friends
here, we don't have any family.

01:10:58.117 --> 01:10:59.885
Why does it matter
so much to you?

01:11:03.222 --> 01:11:05.925
Because it matters,
because it does.

01:11:05.958 --> 01:11:07.126
Because it's important.

01:11:08.094 --> 01:11:10.029
Because I deserve this.

01:11:10.062 --> 01:11:11.030
I had a shitty childhood,

01:11:11.063 --> 01:11:14.166
and I deserve this, and
I deserve a lot more.

01:11:15.667 --> 01:11:17.669
And if you don't
fucking understand that,

01:11:17.702 --> 01:11:19.737
then you're stupider
than I think you are.

01:11:19.771 --> 01:11:20.672
Get the fuck away from me, pig.

01:11:20.705 --> 01:11:21.373
Right now.

01:12:04.183 --> 01:12:05.451
And there have already
been dire predictions,

01:12:05.484 --> 01:12:07.987
that after the big bang,
there'll be a bloodbath,

01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:11.056
as a multitude of firms
struggle to survive.

01:12:11.090 --> 01:12:12.958
But what's actually does
the 'big bang' mean?

01:12:12.992 --> 01:12:14.160
Oh yeah.

01:12:14.193 --> 01:12:15.727
Yeah, one minute.

01:12:16.462 --> 01:12:17.963
Oh one of the guys is
bringing the wife tonight,

01:12:17.997 --> 01:12:21.733
so I asked Al, so she
won't be the only one.

01:12:21.766 --> 01:12:23.801
Yeah, of course.

01:12:23.836 --> 01:12:24.802
So you're coming?

01:12:24.837 --> 01:12:26.172
Yeah.

01:12:26.205 --> 01:12:27.873
To confirm tonight.

01:12:28.806 --> 01:12:29.441
What?

01:12:29.475 --> 01:12:30.808
No, nothing.

01:12:32.077 --> 01:12:33.012
I'll, yeah?

01:12:33.979 --> 01:12:35.047
One minute.

01:13:24.897 --> 01:13:26.798
Thanks for this, Jim.

01:13:26.832 --> 01:13:28.133
Thank you.

01:13:28.167 --> 01:13:31.270
It's great to have an
extra pair of hands around.

01:13:31.303 --> 01:13:32.471
How are you doing?

01:13:32.504 --> 01:13:34.073
Okay.

01:13:34.106 --> 01:13:35.541
It feels good to work.

01:13:35.574 --> 01:13:36.442
Good.

01:13:36.475 --> 01:13:38.477
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:14:45.277 --> 01:14:46.412
Why would you hurt someone?

01:14:46.445 --> 01:14:47.913
You're so gentle.

01:14:47.946 --> 01:14:48.914
Why did you do it?

01:14:50.916 --> 01:14:51.850
What happened?

01:14:52.951 --> 01:14:54.153
I don't know.

01:14:56.255 --> 01:14:57.323
They bullied me.

01:14:59.458 --> 01:15:00.359
Honey, who?

01:15:03.629 --> 01:15:05.397
Some older boys.

01:15:06.265 --> 01:15:07.566
Why didn't you tell me?

01:15:11.203 --> 01:15:13.172
I don't know.

01:15:13.205 --> 01:15:15.074
Hey, you know you
can tell me anything,

01:15:15.107 --> 01:15:16.375
you know that, right?

01:15:19.912 --> 01:15:21.380
I didn't want to make you sad.

01:15:22.948 --> 01:15:25.284
Baby, you can never make me sad.

01:15:25.317 --> 01:15:27.086
You just need to
talk to me, okay?

01:15:35.094 --> 01:15:37.529
I know something's really
wrong with you and Dad.

01:15:40.299 --> 01:15:42.601
No, everything's fine.

01:15:42.634 --> 01:15:45.237
Honestly, you have
nothing to worry about.

01:15:47.206 --> 01:15:47.873
Look at me.

01:15:47.906 --> 01:15:49.541
You have nothing no worry about.

01:16:05.057 --> 01:16:06.558
Who are they?

01:16:06.592 --> 01:16:07.526
My friends.

01:16:08.727 --> 01:16:10.162
From where?

01:16:10.195 --> 01:16:11.230
Around.

01:16:11.263 --> 01:16:12.531
How old are they?

01:16:13.599 --> 01:16:15.401
Really, you want to
start parenting me now?

01:16:15.434 --> 01:16:17.002
Yeah I do, you shouldn't
be sitting around

01:16:17.035 --> 01:16:18.203
with some random locals.

01:16:18.237 --> 01:16:18.937
Well then we probably

01:16:18.971 --> 01:16:21.240
should have stayed in New York.

01:16:21.273 --> 01:16:23.075
You know you can
blame shit on me Sam,

01:16:23.108 --> 01:16:23.809
but you're the
one who's going to

01:16:23.843 --> 01:16:25.277
have to live with your choices.

01:16:27.079 --> 01:16:28.347
I don't have to
make choices, Mom.

01:16:28.380 --> 01:16:30.682
I'll just find a man to
make my choices for me.

01:16:33.318 --> 01:16:34.987
Why are you trying to hurt me?

01:16:35.754 --> 01:16:36.622
I'm not.

01:16:37.589 --> 01:16:39.525
I need you to watch
your brother tonight.

01:16:39.558 --> 01:16:40.459
I have plans.

01:16:40.492 --> 01:16:41.727
Sam.

01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:43.061
I heard you, mother.

01:16:47.166 --> 01:16:49.101
Your mum is the shits.

01:16:49.134 --> 01:16:50.002
Shut up.

01:16:51.203 --> 01:16:53.071
Yeah, let's go up to ,

01:16:53.105 --> 01:16:54.406
we'll go wait for you, too.

01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:57.009
Fuck that, it's fucking
boring isn't it.

01:16:57.042 --> 01:16:58.444
All right.

01:16:58.477 --> 01:17:01.980
Let's have here.

01:17:02.014 --> 01:17:02.714
Sure.

01:17:02.748 --> 01:17:04.049
- Yeah?
- I don't care.

01:17:04.082 --> 01:17:05.250
Let's get some speed.

01:17:05.284 --> 01:17:06.418
I'm just kiddin'.

01:17:06.452 --> 01:17:07.286
Okay.

01:17:07.319 --> 01:17:08.420
How much is it?

01:17:08.454 --> 01:17:10.255
I've got money, I'll buy it.

01:17:10.289 --> 01:17:11.957
I can get a fuckload for

01:17:13.025 --> 01:17:14.126
40 or 50 quid.

01:17:16.495 --> 01:17:17.429
Go.

01:17:18.664 --> 01:17:20.065
Yeah, okay.

01:17:20.098 --> 01:17:20.966
So?

01:17:42.621 --> 01:17:44.389
I've only been once
to New York City.

01:17:44.423 --> 01:17:45.457
A bit scary, but I liked it.

01:17:45.491 --> 01:17:49.161
Not on the upper east side
it isn't, near the park.

01:17:49.194 --> 01:17:51.663
It's wonderful, we'll
miss it won't we?

01:17:51.697 --> 01:17:54.233
We'll always visit,
especially in autumn.

01:17:54.266 --> 01:17:56.201
Or fall, they call it fall.

01:17:56.235 --> 01:17:59.371
New York is magnificent
in the fall.

01:17:59.404 --> 01:18:00.339
And Allison, are you from there?

01:18:00.372 --> 01:18:01.273
Yeah, born and bred.

01:18:01.306 --> 01:18:02.708
Raised in New York
City, one of the few.

01:18:02.741 --> 01:18:04.109
Oh really?

01:18:04.142 --> 01:18:04.844
You grew up in New York,

01:18:04.878 --> 01:18:06.778
so London must be a big change?

01:18:07.713 --> 01:18:10.249
Well, the winters
are milder here

01:18:10.282 --> 01:18:12.384
so it's better for my work.

01:18:12.417 --> 01:18:14.086
Oh, what do you do, Allison?

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:15.787
Well,

01:18:21.527 --> 01:18:24.296
I work on a farm shoveling
shit out of pigpens.

01:18:30.335 --> 01:18:32.304
Well to those names surely.

01:18:32.337 --> 01:18:33.138
Obviously she's joking.

01:18:33.171 --> 01:18:35.073
No I'm not, I
picked up some work.

01:18:37.576 --> 01:18:40.212
Well, you haven't
experienced winter

01:18:40.245 --> 01:18:41.480
until you come to Norway.

01:18:42.447 --> 01:18:44.082
I'm sure, I'm sure.

01:18:47.119 --> 01:18:49.621
You know what the new places
is to summer, Portugal.

01:18:49.655 --> 01:18:51.390
There's a development
on on the Algarve,

01:18:51.423 --> 01:18:53.559
I'm getting in on
the ground floor.

01:18:53.592 --> 01:18:55.460
I've already bought
us a condo there.

01:18:55.494 --> 01:18:56.495
I'm bringing together equity

01:18:56.528 --> 01:18:59.431
for a group of financiers
who are developing it.

01:18:59.464 --> 01:19:03.302
I tell you, the future of
European summer, Portugal.

01:19:04.336 --> 01:19:05.771
Better than the Riviera,

01:19:05.804 --> 01:19:07.639
it's so bloody packed nowadays.

01:20:21.279 --> 01:20:23.448
There he is!

01:20:56.682 --> 01:20:57.549
Sam!

01:21:23.910 --> 01:21:25.243
I'll arrange the
tickets for you.

01:21:25.277 --> 01:21:26.478
You're seeing a play,

01:21:26.511 --> 01:21:29.247
and the National Theater in
London is a unique experience.

01:21:29.281 --> 01:21:30.850
Anthony Hopkins is
playing there this year.

01:21:30.883 --> 01:21:32.919
Can you imagine being
in the same room

01:21:32.952 --> 01:21:34.486
as an actor of that caliber?

01:21:34.519 --> 01:21:36.856
The proximity, the
emotions you'll get to see,

01:21:36.889 --> 01:21:38.757
the ferocity of the
performance like that.

01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:41.593
I mean it's only in the
theater is what they say,

01:21:41.626 --> 01:21:42.494
only in the theater.

01:21:46.032 --> 01:21:48.000
You're so full of shit.

01:21:48.034 --> 01:21:50.435
Did you read that in
the paper this morning?

01:21:50.469 --> 01:21:53.271
My husband has never set foot
in a theater in his life.

01:21:55.474 --> 01:21:57.342
Please excuse me
while I freshen up.

01:22:02.347 --> 01:22:03.049
Wives don't always know

01:22:03.082 --> 01:22:05.584
what their husbands get up to.

01:22:05.617 --> 01:22:08.286
Yes, especially elicit
trips to the theater.

01:22:09.721 --> 01:22:10.923
Can we talk about the vision

01:22:10.957 --> 01:22:12.824
you've got for your new project?

01:22:12.859 --> 01:22:13.792
Please do,

01:22:13.825 --> 01:22:15.761
we were beginning to
think you never would.

01:22:27.907 --> 01:22:28.975
It's beautiful.

01:22:32.444 --> 01:22:33.846
Do you want it?

01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:35.480
I'm sorry.

01:22:35.514 --> 01:22:37.649
If you like it you
should take it.

01:22:37.682 --> 01:22:38.517
I can't.

01:22:38.550 --> 01:22:39.417
Seriously, keep it.

01:22:43.755 --> 01:22:46.758
Our aim is to provide
a complete service

01:22:46.792 --> 01:22:47.692
so the clients will return.

01:22:47.726 --> 01:22:50.062
We've already begun
to do this with oil,

01:22:50.096 --> 01:22:51.530
by purchasing...

01:22:51.563 --> 01:22:52.231
Will you excuse me?

01:22:52.265 --> 01:22:54.666
Purchasing shares in refineries.

01:23:05.945 --> 01:23:06.812
Al?

01:23:08.047 --> 01:23:08.915
Excuse me.

01:23:11.683 --> 01:23:12.551
Allison?

01:23:49.588 --> 01:23:50.722
Vodka tonic.

01:24:22.154 --> 01:24:23.022
Another.

01:25:35.194 --> 01:25:37.595
Oh bye bye, Adam, travel safe.

01:25:37.629 --> 01:25:38.998
It was a pleasure.

01:25:39.031 --> 01:25:40.465
Yeah, bye bye now.

01:25:43.702 --> 01:25:45.104
Sorry about that.

01:25:45.137 --> 01:25:46.538
Allison's fucking crazy.

01:25:49.275 --> 01:25:52.244
So it went well, right?

01:25:52.278 --> 01:25:53.212
Yeah, it was fine.

01:25:53.245 --> 01:25:55.613
It didn't go fine, it
went well, capiche.

01:25:55.647 --> 01:25:56.916
Come on let's get...

01:25:56.949 --> 01:25:57.984
I'm all right.

01:25:58.017 --> 01:25:59.551
I missed the last train.

01:25:59.584 --> 01:26:00.252
I can't go home.

01:26:00.286 --> 01:26:01.153
Stay out with me.

01:26:02.088 --> 01:26:02.922
Stay out with me.

01:26:02.955 --> 01:26:04.123
I'm just a bit tired.

01:26:04.156 --> 01:26:05.024
Fuck off!

01:26:06.125 --> 01:26:08.693
When have you ever said
'no' to a night out with me?

01:26:08.727 --> 01:26:09.561
Come on.

01:26:09.594 --> 01:26:10.963
I can't, you know that.

01:26:11.864 --> 01:26:13.531
Me, why?

01:26:13.565 --> 01:26:15.101
I can't control her.

01:26:15.134 --> 01:26:17.236
She's mental, it's
nothing to do with me.

01:26:17.269 --> 01:26:20.172
They weren't impressed
by your bullshit, Rory.

01:26:20.206 --> 01:26:22.141
It wasn't necessary.

01:26:22.174 --> 01:26:24.642
You're getting wound up about
nothing, this'll be fine.

01:26:24.676 --> 01:26:27.213
I'll follow up with
them next week, relax.

01:26:27.246 --> 01:26:28.180
When you set out,

01:26:28.214 --> 01:26:29.949
they said they just
want to work with me.

01:26:30.983 --> 01:26:31.884
Well of course they
want to work with you,

01:26:31.917 --> 01:26:33.319
it's your account,
I'll take a backseat.

01:26:33.352 --> 01:26:35.855
No no no no no no,
you're off this, mate.

01:26:35.888 --> 01:26:37.789
You got nothing to
do with this deal.

01:26:42.727 --> 01:26:43.628
Well, no offense,

01:26:43.661 --> 01:26:44.497
but there wouldn't
be a deal without me.

01:26:44.529 --> 01:26:46.731
You were gonna sit
on it for a year.

01:26:46.765 --> 01:26:47.799
Oh yeah?

01:26:47.833 --> 01:26:49.201
Yeah, and the way you were
structuring your shit.

01:26:49.235 --> 01:26:50.169
All right, all right,

01:26:50.202 --> 01:26:51.303
you do things your way,
I'll do things my way.

01:26:51.337 --> 01:26:52.338
Can we just talk about this
in the office on Monday?

01:26:52.371 --> 01:26:54.974
You're angry because
Allison fucked things up.

01:26:55.007 --> 01:26:57.977
I'm not angry, I'm not
angry, but I am going home.

01:27:04.316 --> 01:27:05.184
You're serious?

01:27:09.088 --> 01:27:10.688
I'll see you Monday.

01:27:18.931 --> 01:27:20.066
Big night then?

01:27:21.267 --> 01:27:22.134
No, not really.

01:27:23.701 --> 01:27:24.970
Just been working too hard.

01:27:27.239 --> 01:27:28.807
What line of work you in?

01:27:39.218 --> 01:27:40.618
I pretend I'm rich.

01:27:43.822 --> 01:27:44.890
Why do you pretend?

01:27:47.059 --> 01:27:48.928
I don't know.

01:27:52.331 --> 01:27:53.199
Sorry.

01:27:54.867 --> 01:27:55.733
It is.

01:27:58.904 --> 01:28:00.605
I had a million dollars once.

01:28:02.674 --> 01:28:03.542
I was living in New York City.

01:28:03.576 --> 01:28:05.610
I had one million
dollars in the bank.

01:28:09.415 --> 01:28:10.815
I thought it'd just keep coming.

01:28:12.051 --> 01:28:14.086
I thought that was it, I was
rich for the rest of my life.

01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:14.987
And then,

01:28:16.255 --> 01:28:18.257
over time it just, it went.

01:28:23.229 --> 01:28:24.330
Now I have nothing.

01:28:28.367 --> 01:28:30.002
You have kids?

01:28:30.035 --> 01:28:31.203
Yeah I do, two.

01:28:32.304 --> 01:28:34.006
What are you going
on about then?

01:28:34.039 --> 01:28:34.672
That's all that matters.

01:28:34.706 --> 01:28:36.842
Everything else is nonsense.

01:28:36.876 --> 01:28:38.177
It's the only reason
we're put on this Earth,

01:28:38.210 --> 01:28:40.146
well, that and football.

01:28:41.180 --> 01:28:42.047
Yep.

01:28:44.183 --> 01:28:45.817
You a good dad?

01:28:45.851 --> 01:28:47.620
Yeah, I'm the best.

01:28:48.387 --> 01:28:49.188
I keep a roof over their head,

01:28:49.221 --> 01:28:50.256
I give them the
best of everything,

01:28:50.289 --> 01:28:52.391
and I've never laid a
hand on them, never would.

01:28:53.758 --> 01:28:54.659
That's the bare minimum mate,

01:28:54.692 --> 01:28:57.695
don't pat yourself
on the back for that.

01:28:57.729 --> 01:28:59.731
Well that's more than
I ever fucking had.

01:28:59.764 --> 01:29:00.665
We have to give our kids

01:29:00.698 --> 01:29:02.700
more than we had,
that's it, that's life.

01:29:03.936 --> 01:29:06.939
Sort yourself out
mate, get a job.

01:29:06.972 --> 01:29:09.441
Make a wage, you'll
be all right.

01:29:09.475 --> 01:29:12.144
I want more than that, thanks.

01:29:12.178 --> 01:29:14.779
What do you want then, mate?

01:29:24.890 --> 01:29:26.892
I don't actually know.

01:29:29.395 --> 01:29:30.462
I don't know.

01:29:34.033 --> 01:29:35.834
I don't fucking know.

01:29:47.413 --> 01:29:49.048
What are you doing?

01:29:50.082 --> 01:29:51.283
Well you just told
me that you're broke,

01:29:51.317 --> 01:29:52.484
and that you're a liar.

01:29:52.518 --> 01:29:54.320
Do you really have the rest
of the money for this fare?

01:29:54.353 --> 01:29:55.187
Not on me, I said that.

01:29:55.221 --> 01:29:57.189
But at the house I do.

01:29:57.223 --> 01:29:58.823
I'll have to let you off.

01:29:58.857 --> 01:30:00.426
Are you fucking joking?

01:30:00.459 --> 01:30:02.528
I won't take you
any further, mate.

01:30:02.561 --> 01:30:04.964
Sorry, don't trust
ya, you can walk.

01:30:06.198 --> 01:30:07.466
Mate, I'm miles from my house.

01:30:07.499 --> 01:30:09.335
I can't fucking walk.

01:30:13.372 --> 01:30:15.107
Get out of my car.

01:30:20.112 --> 01:30:20.980
Fuck.

01:30:51.610 --> 01:30:52.478
Fuck.

01:33:40.345 --> 01:33:41.213
Fuck!

01:35:40.599 --> 01:35:41.533
Samantha?

01:35:50.208 --> 01:35:51.076
Sam?

01:35:52.444 --> 01:35:53.445
Mom?

01:35:55.280 --> 01:35:56.615
Benjamin?

01:35:56.648 --> 01:35:57.649
Mom?

01:36:11.864 --> 01:36:13.866
Oh my God, Beanie.

01:36:13.900 --> 01:36:15.734
What happened, are you okay?

01:36:17.502 --> 01:36:19.104
Ben, where's your sister?

01:36:19.906 --> 01:36:22.307
I don't know, she had a
party, I stayed in here.

01:36:22.341 --> 01:36:23.709
Jesus Christ.

01:36:23.742 --> 01:36:25.644
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:36:25.677 --> 01:36:27.613
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

01:36:27.646 --> 01:36:28.513
So sorry.

01:36:29.849 --> 01:36:30.749
Mom?

01:36:30.782 --> 01:36:31.450
What?

01:36:31.483 --> 01:36:33.185
I've gotta show you something.

01:37:44.523 --> 01:37:48.760
Mom?

01:37:48.794 --> 01:37:49.661
Mom?

01:37:53.498 --> 01:37:54.366
Mom!

01:39:24.623 --> 01:39:25.858
Let's make breakfast.

01:39:27.526 --> 01:39:28.393
Yeah.

01:39:33.099 --> 01:39:34.934
Yeah, okay, we can
make this work.

01:39:36.535 --> 01:39:37.602
You want to put on a tea?

01:39:37.636 --> 01:39:38.470
I'll do the rest.

01:39:38.503 --> 01:39:39.538
Okay.

01:39:39.571 --> 01:39:40.438
Okay.

01:40:29.922 --> 01:40:30.789
Al?

01:40:33.558 --> 01:40:35.794
Will you come in here
and talk to me a minute?

01:40:39.165 --> 01:40:40.532
Anything you have to say to me

01:40:40.565 --> 01:40:42.434
you can say in front
of my children.

01:40:48.473 --> 01:40:50.542
I was thinking that
you were right,

01:40:50.575 --> 01:40:54.746
and maybe living out here
isn't such a good idea.

01:40:54.779 --> 01:40:56.681
We should get a flat in London,

01:40:57.984 --> 01:41:00.485
while I'm putting my
own company together.

01:41:00.518 --> 01:41:03.122
Teaming up with Arthur's
been holding me back,

01:41:03.155 --> 01:41:04.723
and I've got some
really good leads,

01:41:04.756 --> 01:41:06.825
and if I have a place in
town, if we're in town,

01:41:06.859 --> 01:41:08.928
and I can be home more,
I could work more.

01:41:18.070 --> 01:41:18.938
Rory,

01:41:21.173 --> 01:41:22.041
stop.

01:41:29.115 --> 01:41:29.982
I'm sorry.
