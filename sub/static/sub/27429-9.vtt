00:00.010 --> 00:01.470
Previously on Good Trouble...

00:01.480 --> 00:03.010
I'm Jesus. Can I buy you a drink?

00:03.020 --> 00:04.660
No, but I'll buy you one.

00:05.280 --> 00:08.730
I actually made plans with that
girl that I met the other night.

00:08.740 --> 00:11.040
I thought I could do this
casual thing with you,

00:11.060 --> 00:12.560
but I don't want to
share you with anyone.

00:12.570 --> 00:14.280
Gael, just a friend?

00:14.300 --> 00:15.850
I just like to know who I'm up against.

00:15.880 --> 00:17.280
I'm just afraid that...

00:17.320 --> 00:21.140
- I won't do what I need to do if...
- You're seeing me.

00:21.170 --> 00:22.610
Mom is sick.

00:22.620 --> 00:23.650
For real this time?

00:23.680 --> 00:25.300
If I help her plan this wedding,

00:25.320 --> 00:27.700
then I'll be numb to the fact
that she's not marrying me.

00:27.710 --> 00:29.459
- Hi, I'm Kate.
- I'm Callie.

00:29.460 --> 00:31.360
- Who's your judge?
- Judge Wilson.

00:31.380 --> 00:32.509
Judge Handelman.

00:32.520 --> 00:33.550
Handelman?

00:33.560 --> 00:35.880
Becca, did Handelman
sexually harass you?

00:35.940 --> 00:37.080
If he's doing it to Kate,

00:37.100 --> 00:38.509
she's gonna have to
come forward herself.

00:38.510 --> 00:40.060
I'd appreciate it if
you didn't tell anyone

00:40.080 --> 00:41.100
about our conversation.

00:41.110 --> 00:42.920
Your honor? Can I ask you a favor?

00:42.960 --> 00:45.060
It's about Judge Handelman.

00:47.400 --> 00:48.940
I'm sure selling your sexuality...

00:48.960 --> 00:50.820
You have no idea what it's like.

00:50.850 --> 00:54.000
- Insensitive? You're the one...
- I am not sorry!

01:40.080 --> 01:41.950
Morning.

01:50.870 --> 01:52.820
So, I'm not planning on...

01:52.830 --> 01:54.319
... seeing your brother again.

01:54.320 --> 01:55.739
Yeah, no.

01:55.740 --> 01:57.860
- I mean, he lives in San Diego.
- Right.

01:57.870 --> 01:59.110
- And we're just...
- I get it.

01:59.120 --> 02:01.620
- I didn't know he was...
- I know.

02:02.900 --> 02:05.260
Talk about a small world.

02:05.300 --> 02:06.990
Yeah.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.720
It's very small.

02:11.080 --> 02:14.530
I don't know if Rebecca will say
anything to the judge, but...

02:14.600 --> 02:15.999
she's probably figured out

02:16.000 --> 02:17.660
that we don't just live
in the same building.

02:17.670 --> 02:20.550
Of all the girls your brother
could have hooked up with

02:20.560 --> 02:22.239
- in L.A.
- Right?!

02:24.020 --> 02:25.099
Don't we have court?

02:25.100 --> 02:26.510
- Yeah.
- Yep.

02:27.500 --> 02:29.980
So, Rebecca, six more weeks.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.460
How's the job prospect going?

02:31.470 --> 02:33.139
I'm considering a few offers.

02:33.140 --> 02:34.920
Offers? What are they?

02:34.930 --> 02:36.780
The Lassiter Group, for one.

02:36.800 --> 02:37.860
The Lassiter Group?

02:37.880 --> 02:40.050
They're an underknown,
underfunded non-firm...

02:40.060 --> 02:41.780
- ... in Denver.
- They're small,

02:41.800 --> 02:43.880
but they do some work for the RNC,

02:43.890 --> 02:46.920
and it'll give me a chance to
make a bigger impact there.

02:46.930 --> 02:48.620
Still, a little disappointing, I'm sure,

02:48.640 --> 02:51.920
if that's the best you could do
after clerking for a Federal judge.

02:51.930 --> 02:54.960
I also have an offer from
McClellan, Peterson & Cole, in...

02:54.970 --> 02:56.100
D.C.

02:57.240 --> 02:59.210
Wow.

02:59.220 --> 03:01.760
Congratulations, that's one of
the best firms in the country.

03:01.780 --> 03:03.130
Your hard work really paid off.

03:05.850 --> 03:08.380
Hey, uh, Kate, right?

03:08.420 --> 03:09.860
Yes. Hi, Ben.

03:12.970 --> 03:15.200
Judge Handelman in court this morning?

03:15.220 --> 03:18.810
He is. A boring minor injury case.

03:22.680 --> 03:23.920
Good morning.

03:23.940 --> 03:25.639
Sorry, we thought you'd
already gone down.

03:25.640 --> 03:27.920
- No worries. Hello.
- Hi.

03:28.100 --> 03:31.090
- Oh! Judge Wilson, this is Kate...
- Nguyen.

03:31.100 --> 03:33.710
She's Judge Handelman's new clerk.

03:33.720 --> 03:37.090
Your honor? Can I ask a favor.

03:37.100 --> 03:39.130
It's about Judge Handelman.

03:39.140 --> 03:41.820
I've heard he's been inappropriate...

03:41.880 --> 03:44.800
and he's not supposed to
hire female clerks anymore.

03:44.810 --> 03:46.000
Where did you hear that?

03:46.010 --> 03:47.580
I'd rather not say.

03:47.640 --> 03:51.000
Last night, I met his new clerk.

03:51.080 --> 03:52.960
Her name is Kate.

03:53.060 --> 03:54.700
Oh, nice to meet you, Kate.

04:00.400 --> 04:01.659
See you around.

04:01.660 --> 04:04.100
Hope so.

04:06.360 --> 04:08.820
Maybe we should just go with a DJ?

04:08.860 --> 04:11.760
- Save money.
- But we said we wanted live music.

04:11.770 --> 04:13.420
Okay.

04:13.430 --> 04:15.020
Baby wants a band.

04:15.040 --> 04:17.050
I'll see if I can get Coldplay.

04:17.060 --> 04:18.279
Yeah!

04:18.300 --> 04:19.820
Oop, I'm late for work.

04:19.880 --> 04:22.140
- Don't forget tomorrow...
- Lunch with your parents.

04:24.850 --> 04:27.970
- I'll see you tonight.
- 'Kay.

04:31.100 --> 04:33.340
Hey, so, I was thinking...

04:33.420 --> 04:35.260
maybe we could throw
Sumi a surprise shower.

04:35.270 --> 04:37.060
We...

04:37.120 --> 04:38.460
could...

04:38.560 --> 04:40.100
- we could, yeah.
- Great.

04:40.110 --> 04:41.119
Maybe we can get together

04:41.120 --> 04:42.340
while Sumi's at work one day.

04:42.980 --> 04:44.500
Of course! Yeah.

04:44.510 --> 04:45.840
Great, I'll just text you.

04:45.920 --> 04:47.009
Sounds good.

04:47.010 --> 04:48.630
Yeah...

04:57.670 --> 04:59.100
They'll be married soon, okay?

04:59.120 --> 05:01.260
And then Sumi will live with Meera,

05:01.280 --> 05:03.610
and this whole experiment
in torture will be over.

05:03.620 --> 05:05.530
What about lunches with your parents?

05:05.540 --> 05:07.530
That's forever.

05:07.540 --> 05:09.200
They love Sumi.

05:09.210 --> 05:10.370
But they don't know that she's your ex?

05:10.380 --> 05:12.820
Ex-roommate, best friend.

05:12.830 --> 05:13.900
But if they did know,

05:13.920 --> 05:15.900
they probably would have
chosen her in the break-up.

05:15.910 --> 05:17.280
I don't believe that.

05:17.300 --> 05:18.640
Trust me.

05:18.750 --> 05:20.530
They would.

05:20.540 --> 05:21.780
Really.

05:21.790 --> 05:22.980
Damn.

05:29.540 --> 05:30.570
Dom.

05:30.580 --> 05:31.700
Hey.

05:31.720 --> 05:33.610
How'd you know where I work?

05:33.620 --> 05:35.400
I may have stalked your Instagram.

05:35.460 --> 05:36.820
Everything okay?

05:36.830 --> 05:38.340
It's all good.

05:38.360 --> 05:39.520
So you just missed me?

05:39.540 --> 05:42.060
Mom...

05:42.080 --> 05:44.060
asked me to give you this.

05:45.100 --> 05:48.120
What's in it? Suspicious white powder?

05:49.400 --> 05:51.260
She wants to make amends.

05:53.790 --> 05:54.980
Sounds like AA speak.

05:55.040 --> 05:56.300
She's clean.

05:57.620 --> 05:59.280
And she's not doin' that well.

06:00.480 --> 06:02.280
Here, just read the letter.

06:02.400 --> 06:04.260
I mean, it's the least you could do.

06:05.910 --> 06:06.990
The question is...

06:07.000 --> 06:10.420
do I, or do I not give a willful
blindness instruction to the jury?

06:10.440 --> 06:11.660
To be convicted of a crime,

06:11.670 --> 06:13.780
the jury has to find that Mr. Alvarez

06:13.800 --> 06:17.079
had the specific intent to
participate in a drive-by shooting.

06:17.080 --> 06:19.140
The jury could find Alvarez guilty,

06:19.170 --> 06:21.380
if he took deliberate actions to ignore

06:21.400 --> 06:22.900
that his friend had a gun in the car.

06:22.910 --> 06:24.280
So knowing someone might be

06:24.290 --> 06:26.800
intent on harming or harassing
a potential victim,

06:26.840 --> 06:28.000
makes you complicit.

06:28.870 --> 06:30.780
I guess it depends on a situation.

06:30.790 --> 06:32.140
But, in this instance,

06:32.170 --> 06:34.660
Alvarez knew what his
friend intended to do,

06:34.670 --> 06:37.820
not what he might do based
on his past actions.

06:37.830 --> 06:39.240
Good point.

06:40.710 --> 06:43.820
What if someone's not
directly involved, but...

06:43.830 --> 06:46.280
has knowledge of a
perpetrator's past actions,

06:46.290 --> 06:47.990
if he re-offends, is that person,

06:48.000 --> 06:50.560
especially if they're
in a position of power,

06:50.620 --> 06:52.240
guilty of willful blindness?

06:52.260 --> 06:54.530
As far as I know, no
complaints have been filed.

06:54.540 --> 06:57.000
Can the judge, with
knowledge of his actions,

06:57.020 --> 06:58.820
file a complaint with the Chief Justice?

06:58.830 --> 07:00.820
It would be inappropriate
for a judge to do that

07:00.830 --> 07:03.750
without a victim willing
to come forward.

07:05.520 --> 07:08.919
I think we're getting far
afield of the case at hand.

07:08.920 --> 07:10.460
Thank you for this lively debate.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.380
I will be issuing the jury instruction.

07:17.580 --> 07:20.620
Did you tell Wilson what I told
you about Judge Handelman?

07:22.170 --> 07:24.060
I told him I'd heard rumors

07:24.080 --> 07:26.780
about Handelman and I asked
him to do something about it.

07:26.790 --> 07:29.120
Rumors he knows came from me.

07:29.160 --> 07:30.540
Look...

07:30.600 --> 07:33.620
Rebecca, I know how hard
it is to come forward.

07:33.640 --> 07:35.200
Okay? And...

07:35.210 --> 07:37.820
how triggering it must be, and I get...

07:37.830 --> 07:40.820
the issue with your
grandfather and your family.

07:40.830 --> 07:42.860
But it could be happening to Kate.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.780
And she doesn't have a grandfather

07:44.790 --> 07:46.860
who can get her transferred
to another judge.

07:46.870 --> 07:48.950
If it's happening, she can
file a complaint on her own.

07:48.960 --> 07:50.610
And lose a prestigious clerkship?

07:50.620 --> 07:53.740
That she's worked very hard to get?

07:55.120 --> 07:57.080
I was just trying to get
Wilson to do something.

07:57.100 --> 07:59.740
These judges shouldn't be
covering up for each other

07:59.750 --> 08:01.120
or turning a blind eye.

08:01.140 --> 08:03.170
The only oversight they
have is over each other.

08:04.580 --> 08:05.820
What'd he say?

08:05.840 --> 08:09.000
He said that he can't issue a
complaint against Handelman

08:09.020 --> 08:10.910
without a victim willing
to step forward.

08:15.290 --> 08:17.960
You have pretty loose lips for
someone who has secrets of her own.

08:42.460 --> 08:47.000
Hey, um, I have forms
for Jazmin to fill out

08:47.020 --> 08:49.559
for the change of name
and gender petition.

08:49.560 --> 08:52.820
- Thanks, um, can you just...
- Yeah.

09:00.830 --> 09:03.280
Uh, she can also apply for a fee waiver.

09:03.290 --> 09:05.420
She just needs to check the box,

09:05.440 --> 09:08.020
and she needs a letter
from her physician.

09:08.060 --> 09:10.540
I'll make sure to tell her.

09:11.100 --> 09:12.360
Yeah.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
I really appreciate you
doin' this, Callie.

09:21.360 --> 09:23.320
Yeah, I'm happy to.

09:32.980 --> 09:34.830
Postmates arrived.

09:36.540 --> 09:40.940
Hey, Callie was just droppin'
off the forms for Jazmin.

09:40.980 --> 09:42.410
Ah...

09:43.910 --> 09:45.120
By the way, um...

09:45.180 --> 09:47.939
Jamie's reached out to
a couple of attorneys

09:47.940 --> 09:51.110
who might take her case
against the catering company.

09:51.120 --> 09:54.140
So... I will check in with him tonight.

09:56.580 --> 09:57.710
Hey.

09:59.220 --> 10:01.990
So if we organize one protest
on the first day of the trial,

10:02.000 --> 10:04.100
- we'll get a huge turn out for Jamal.
- Okay.

10:04.120 --> 10:06.580
If we try to get people out
every day of the trial,

10:06.600 --> 10:08.950
we'll have fewer people, but
we'll have a daily presence.

10:08.960 --> 10:10.530
And what do you suggest?

10:10.540 --> 10:13.680
I say we go big day one. I mean...

10:13.700 --> 10:15.990
Get a lot of media attention
and then hopefully,

10:16.000 --> 10:18.360
we'll inspire a lot of people
to show up after that.

10:18.420 --> 10:20.520
I can't thank you enough
for doin' all this.

10:20.580 --> 10:22.070
Oh, you don't gotta thank me.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.400
I mean, it's not just Jamal
we're doing this for.

10:24.420 --> 10:26.060
It's for all of us.

10:26.100 --> 10:28.740
If I had a daughter, I'd want
her to be just like you.

10:30.360 --> 10:34.480
Well if I could've picked my
mother, right back at'cha.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.280
Have you heard from her lately?

10:36.910 --> 10:40.000
My brother dropped off
a letter she wrote me.

10:41.620 --> 10:43.080
What'd it say?

10:43.540 --> 10:45.260
I haven't read it.

10:46.440 --> 10:49.759
All I want is a relationship with Dom.

10:49.760 --> 10:51.660
You know, when I first lost Jamal,

10:51.720 --> 10:53.420
I learned sometimes you have to go out

10:53.440 --> 10:55.080
in the world to find your family.

10:55.100 --> 10:56.830
You got your friends.

10:58.870 --> 11:00.120
You got me now.

11:01.960 --> 11:04.140
Am I gonna see you at
the hearing next week?

11:04.240 --> 11:07.220
Wilson's gonna be ruling on
Officer Griffin's personnel file.

11:09.180 --> 11:11.440
I hate to ask you this...

11:11.470 --> 11:15.170
but it would be a lot better for me

11:15.180 --> 11:17.960
if you didn't sit with
Jamal's mother in court.

11:19.340 --> 11:22.180
I'm sorry, I won't be able
to come to the hearing.

11:22.200 --> 11:23.740
I'm on days all week here.

11:23.780 --> 11:26.320
Oh, I understand, honey,
you gotta pay rent.

11:28.680 --> 11:31.860
If I don't help pack the gallery,
they're not gonna ask me back.

11:31.870 --> 11:33.900
You could have a huge
following if you...

11:33.910 --> 11:35.460
put yourself out there.

11:35.500 --> 11:37.560
Especially the queer community.

11:37.580 --> 11:39.570
Come on, your work is super sexy,

11:39.580 --> 11:40.760
and so are you.

11:41.830 --> 11:44.020
Seriously, you need to brand yourself.

11:44.040 --> 11:46.740
Use social media to promote your art,

11:46.820 --> 11:48.570
and that beautiful face.

11:51.870 --> 11:54.830
I don't think I wanna brand
myself as a queer artist.

11:56.060 --> 12:01.070
I mean, I don't label
myself a Latino artist...

12:01.080 --> 12:04.950
and I don't want to use my face
to get people to look at my art.

12:04.960 --> 12:06.280
Okay.

12:07.220 --> 12:08.780
Maybe just your body then.

12:11.380 --> 12:14.610
Hey, listen, you know I'd be happy
to take some hot pictures of you.

12:14.620 --> 12:17.610
In fact, I may already have some.

12:17.620 --> 12:19.160
Oh, wait...

12:19.170 --> 12:20.519
those might be too X-rated.

12:20.520 --> 12:23.820
Yeah, and for your eyes only.

12:23.830 --> 12:24.900
Okay.

12:43.520 --> 12:44.830
Hey...

12:46.260 --> 12:48.560
you're an incredibly talented artist.

12:48.580 --> 12:51.450
But it's not enough to just
let the art speak for itself.

12:51.460 --> 12:52.950
And you don't have to brand yourself

12:52.960 --> 12:55.900
as queer to reach out
to the queer community.

12:55.910 --> 12:57.820
I've got plenty of contacts.

12:58.760 --> 13:00.400
Just say the word.

13:07.960 --> 13:10.000
Look how pretty Sumi looks.

13:12.760 --> 13:15.520
Why you not wearing the
makeup I bought you?

13:15.540 --> 13:16.820
Kylie Jenner.

13:16.920 --> 13:18.100
_

13:18.560 --> 13:20.300
I'm have tinted moisturizer on.

13:20.360 --> 13:22.220
Why is your hair so greasy?

13:22.360 --> 13:25.000
Look at Su, her hair is so nice

13:25.020 --> 13:26.460
like Rachael Ray.

13:29.360 --> 13:31.320
_

13:33.240 --> 13:35.900
- Good talk.
- You talk to your brother?

13:36.910 --> 13:38.870
_

13:38.880 --> 13:40.619
_

13:40.620 --> 13:41.830
With a shower.

13:42.870 --> 13:44.560
_

13:45.320 --> 13:47.459
Why are you always making jokes?

13:47.460 --> 13:48.860
When you going to get a real job?

13:48.870 --> 13:51.299
Sumi is practically a doctor.

13:51.300 --> 13:52.990
Freelance is not a real job.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.500
Your brother is getting
serious with Susan.

13:55.580 --> 13:59.420
Finally, one of my children is going
to make me a proud grandmother.

13:59.440 --> 14:02.150
_

14:02.190 --> 14:03.709
_

14:03.710 --> 14:05.490
I am dating!

14:05.500 --> 14:07.580
Someone...

14:08.100 --> 14:09.410
sort of.

14:10.120 --> 14:11.960
Who is he? What's his name?

14:15.830 --> 14:17.060
Joey.

14:17.100 --> 14:18.740
So, I was...

14:18.780 --> 14:21.140
wondering where we stood
on that second date?

14:21.160 --> 14:23.440
Why don't you come do my show?

14:23.460 --> 14:26.200
By "your show" you mean the live one?

14:26.220 --> 14:27.780
The one that real people listen to?

14:27.840 --> 14:29.610
I have, like...

14:29.620 --> 14:32.040
10 listeners, it's not NPR.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.180
It'll be fun.

14:35.330 --> 14:36.519
What does Joey do?

14:36.520 --> 14:38.280
Is he Chinese?

14:38.290 --> 14:39.680
I don't know, I'm not sure.

14:39.700 --> 14:41.740
You don't know if he's Chinese?

14:41.750 --> 14:43.520
Let's just... can we change the subject?

14:43.540 --> 14:46.140
Why have you been so sneaky?

14:46.160 --> 14:48.700
Well, I have news.

14:48.760 --> 14:51.059
I'm engaged!

14:52.440 --> 14:54.620
You're engaged!

14:54.640 --> 14:56.480
- Mm-hmm.
- What's his name?

14:56.560 --> 14:57.980
Meera.

15:00.790 --> 15:01.860
Meera?

15:01.920 --> 15:03.840
Isn't that a girl's name?

15:03.880 --> 15:05.950
Have you ever met a boy named Meera?!

15:05.960 --> 15:07.380
I'm gay.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.610
Alice...

15:13.620 --> 15:14.830
are you gay?

15:17.960 --> 15:19.120
Yes.

15:19.160 --> 15:23.930
_

15:24.000 --> 15:26.110
I'm engaged.

15:26.120 --> 15:28.240
You're engaged!

15:28.250 --> 15:29.560
What's his name?

15:32.040 --> 15:33.180
Myron.

15:33.220 --> 15:36.080
Your parents must be so proud.

15:36.170 --> 15:38.620
Does he have a brother?

15:54.620 --> 15:56.080
What's new?

15:56.140 --> 15:59.030
Judge Handelman hired
a new female clerk.

15:59.040 --> 16:00.240
Is that so?

16:00.250 --> 16:02.660
I thought he wasn't
supposed to be able to

16:02.700 --> 16:04.580
have any more female clerks.

16:04.620 --> 16:06.240
I thought that was the
deal Grandpa made,

16:06.250 --> 16:07.260
to keep it quiet.

16:07.280 --> 16:08.999
Well, you know how it
is with these judges

16:09.000 --> 16:10.280
and their lifetime appointments.

16:10.290 --> 16:11.960
They get away with murder.

16:12.060 --> 16:14.980
What if he harasses the new girl?

16:15.020 --> 16:16.820
Well, that's none of your concern.

16:17.960 --> 16:19.400
It isn't?

16:19.420 --> 16:20.440
I mean...

16:20.450 --> 16:22.380
shouldn't it concern us all, as women,

16:22.400 --> 16:24.579
if we know someone's being harassed?

16:24.580 --> 16:25.709
First of all, we don't know that.

16:25.710 --> 16:27.110
And frankly...

16:27.120 --> 16:28.750
I think that women have taken this whole

16:28.760 --> 16:30.860
"me too" thing way too far.

16:30.870 --> 16:33.280
You know, back in the day,
when I was a working girl,

16:33.290 --> 16:35.040
I had a boss who was all hands,

16:35.060 --> 16:36.340
and not just with me.

16:36.440 --> 16:38.490
That's not okay, Mom.

16:38.600 --> 16:41.460
Your generation is so sensitive.

16:41.740 --> 16:45.460
You can't handle any
aggression of any kind.

16:45.580 --> 16:47.870
Men will always be men.

16:50.370 --> 16:52.000
Wow.

16:52.020 --> 16:53.700
We're so thrilled about your offer

16:53.720 --> 16:55.900
with McClellan, Peterson & Cole.

16:55.940 --> 16:58.360
Write your grandfather a note,
because he pulled strings

16:58.370 --> 16:59.990
to get you the job.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.820
I'd like to think I had
something to do with it.

17:01.830 --> 17:04.670
I did graduate from Yale Law
at the top of my class.

17:05.540 --> 17:07.530
Don't be defensive.

17:07.540 --> 17:09.079
We're very proud of you.

17:09.140 --> 17:10.819
I haven't accepted the offer yet.

17:10.829 --> 17:12.530
Don't be ridiculous.

17:12.540 --> 17:14.609
Of course you're going to accept it.

17:14.619 --> 17:17.020
You are well on your way with this job.

17:17.079 --> 17:19.799
Don't make a stink of this
whole Handelman business.

17:19.800 --> 17:21.560
Your grandfather got you out of there,

17:21.579 --> 17:24.079
and we don't want any scandal
blowing back on him.

17:24.720 --> 17:28.329
You're lucky you were born with
a family name that opens doors.

17:29.290 --> 17:31.280
Be grateful that you didn't
have to earn everything

17:31.300 --> 17:32.830
the way your grandfather did.

17:34.620 --> 17:36.240
So, do you wanna...

17:36.250 --> 17:37.460
talk about food?

17:37.480 --> 17:40.160
Uh, yeah, let's, um, let's
keep it simple, you know?

17:40.170 --> 17:41.490
The booze is what really matters.

17:41.500 --> 17:42.840
And no toilet paper games.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.900
I like that you know what you want.

17:44.910 --> 17:46.779
Yeah, well, if you're
gonna be with Sumi,

17:46.780 --> 17:47.829
someone's gotta be decisive.

17:47.830 --> 17:49.960
Yeah... and strong.

17:49.980 --> 17:52.800
She always has an excuse when it
comes time to carry anything.

17:52.840 --> 17:55.039
Well, that's 'cause she's tired
from all the yoga classes.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.530
No, the yoga is a workout for her soul.

17:57.540 --> 17:59.990
The aerial silk classes, that's
what really wears her out.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.450
You're really funny.

18:04.460 --> 18:06.100
I am?

18:06.120 --> 18:07.440
Yeah, I...

18:07.460 --> 18:09.860
I wish that I could make
Sumi laugh the way you do.

18:09.870 --> 18:11.860
It's, like, one of the things
she loves most about you.

18:11.870 --> 18:16.170
Well, it's what my parents
hate most about me.

18:17.300 --> 18:20.530
No, for real, like, your
Instas are so funny.

18:20.540 --> 18:22.240
You should do stand-up or something.

18:22.320 --> 18:25.360
I'm actually supposed to go on
a friend's radio show tonight.

18:25.370 --> 18:27.610
A radio show? What, like KROQ?

18:27.620 --> 18:30.740
Uh, no, I'm not ready for FM. It's KFGT.

18:30.770 --> 18:32.760
A small AM station that
gets, like, 10 listeners.

18:32.780 --> 18:35.660
But even that makes me so
nervous I could throw up.

18:35.670 --> 18:36.960
Twice.

18:37.520 --> 18:39.990
Well, I'm sure they're gonna love you.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.300
Just be yourself.

18:47.540 --> 18:49.160
What is he doing?

18:49.170 --> 18:52.040
No idea.

18:55.540 --> 18:57.820
Oh, hey, how's your photo shoot?

18:57.830 --> 18:59.530
Very funny.

18:59.540 --> 19:01.400
Sorry, your house is made of glass.

19:01.410 --> 19:03.320
Uh-oh, what's wrong?

19:03.330 --> 19:04.610
Do you ever feel weird

19:04.620 --> 19:05.860
putting yourself out there?

19:06.000 --> 19:07.670
On your Instagram?

19:08.910 --> 19:12.140
Uh... I feel... vulnerable sometimes,

19:12.200 --> 19:14.180
you know...

19:14.200 --> 19:16.700
but "coming out" as who I am,

19:16.710 --> 19:19.990
as someone who loves her body how it is,

19:20.000 --> 19:21.530
has been empowering.

19:21.540 --> 19:23.200
Why?

19:23.260 --> 19:25.110
Bryan thinks I should take...

19:25.120 --> 19:26.950
"sexy" pictures...

19:26.960 --> 19:28.869
with my art to get attention.

19:28.870 --> 19:30.319
If you're not comfortable
showing your body,

19:30.320 --> 19:31.990
you don't have to.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.240
Although...

19:33.250 --> 19:34.620
people may come to check out your bod,

19:34.650 --> 19:36.540
- but stay to appreciate your art.
- Ugh,

19:36.580 --> 19:38.570
it happens to me all the time.

19:40.840 --> 19:42.990
He also thinks that I should,

19:43.000 --> 19:45.219
like, reach out to the queer community.

19:45.220 --> 19:47.180
And that's something you're
not comfortable doing?

19:49.040 --> 19:53.060
I think it's more about saying
I'm one thing or another.

19:53.410 --> 19:54.450
What if you...

19:54.460 --> 19:56.240
reach out to the Latinx community?

19:56.300 --> 20:00.040
As a multi-talented, multi-medium
Latino artist in L.A.

20:00.080 --> 20:01.620
You're an inspiration.

20:03.250 --> 20:04.400
Seriously?

20:04.420 --> 20:07.030
Yeah! Look at Frida Kahlo.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.400
Latinx.

20:08.410 --> 20:09.990
Queer. Iconic.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.010
Worked for her.

20:11.020 --> 20:13.860
And then, you don't have to
brand yourself as one thing.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.110
But,

20:15.120 --> 20:17.700
it's better if you define your
work before someone else does.

20:17.710 --> 20:19.560
Especially before your show.

20:20.790 --> 20:23.660
Thanks, guys. Helps a lot.

20:23.720 --> 20:25.410
Mm.

20:26.700 --> 20:29.660
Ugh, I'm so good at
giving advice lately.

20:29.720 --> 20:30.800
Girl...

20:35.080 --> 20:37.380
Welcome back to the show.

20:37.420 --> 20:39.950
I am super excited to have my...

20:39.960 --> 20:43.070
awesome, hilarious friend, Alice
Kwan, here with us tonight.

20:43.080 --> 20:44.780
Hey, Alice, say hi.

20:44.790 --> 20:46.379
Hi!

20:46.380 --> 20:48.990
What do we do, do we
just talk to each other?

20:49.000 --> 20:50.780
Yeah, just a normal conversation.

20:50.790 --> 20:53.160
- Like, what's on your mind?
- Um...

20:57.380 --> 21:00.500
Well... what's the deal
with frozen yogurt, right?

21:01.830 --> 21:04.280
It's not like we ever
eat warm ice cream.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.280
Why did God create cockroaches?

21:10.380 --> 21:12.180
Or the Kardashians?

21:12.240 --> 21:14.200
There's s-so many of them.

21:14.220 --> 21:15.660
Running around the house.

21:15.690 --> 21:17.039
When you think about it, you know,

21:17.040 --> 21:19.940
a-a uterus is like an
escape room for babies.

21:19.980 --> 21:21.260
"Get me out of here."

21:21.320 --> 21:23.020
They don't know what to do.

21:23.040 --> 21:25.040
If I had a nickel for every single time

21:25.060 --> 21:27.260
I woke myself up with my own farts,

21:27.300 --> 21:28.990
I'd have 13 cents.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.570
I'm not a big fan of cheese.

21:30.660 --> 21:33.100
I always wonder why our sexy parts

21:33.120 --> 21:34.720
are in the same place
as our poopy parts.

21:35.780 --> 21:37.780
I'm the worst, okay?

21:37.800 --> 21:39.119
I bombed so bad.

21:39.120 --> 21:40.620
Uh, just need to...

21:40.640 --> 21:41.950
- ... breathe, just relax.
- No, I...

21:41.960 --> 21:44.239
I need to leave, okay? I'm
sorry I ruined your show.

21:44.240 --> 21:46.720
- Please don't go.
- I'm not funny. Okay?

21:46.740 --> 21:47.990
You are funny

21:48.000 --> 21:50.120
when you talk about yourself.

21:50.180 --> 21:52.570
Come on, the song's almost over.

21:52.580 --> 21:55.320
Just... be you.

22:02.260 --> 22:04.400
And we are back.

22:04.410 --> 22:07.450
Alice and I were just, uh,
chatting about her day.

22:07.460 --> 22:09.990
So, tell me about it.

22:12.170 --> 22:13.480
Well-well, um,

22:13.500 --> 22:17.110
well, today I had lunch with my
ex-girlfriend and my parents.

22:17.280 --> 22:19.400
Ex-girlfriend that I'm totally over.

22:19.410 --> 22:21.900
Like, I don't even dream about
her anymore or anything.

22:21.910 --> 22:25.490
Except my parents are still in love
with her, so that's a problem.

22:25.500 --> 22:29.520
Seriously, like, my mom would
marry her if she had the chance.

22:29.580 --> 22:32.160
But, she's getting
married to someone else.

22:32.170 --> 22:33.700
And thank God it's not me.

22:33.710 --> 22:35.110
'Cause she's kinda self-involved.

22:35.120 --> 22:37.820
You know, last week, I caught her

22:37.830 --> 22:39.740
looking at her own reflection in a fork.

22:41.870 --> 22:44.619
And she's one of those people who
always gets song lyrics wrong.

22:44.620 --> 22:47.400
Like you know that song, "We Built
This City" on rock 'n' roll?

22:47.410 --> 22:50.950
She thinks the lyrics are "We built
this city on sausage rolls."

22:50.960 --> 22:53.500
What?!

22:53.580 --> 22:56.200
I mean, they deserve
each other, you know.

22:56.220 --> 22:57.840
I mean, they both think
Elvis is still alive,

22:57.860 --> 22:59.450
and the earth might be flat.

23:03.040 --> 23:04.820
You were so funny.

23:04.830 --> 23:06.080
You were great.

23:06.180 --> 23:09.280
A friend of mine who has
a weekly comedy show,

23:09.340 --> 23:11.450
she texted me to see if you'd be on it.

23:11.460 --> 23:13.590
Really?

23:13.620 --> 23:16.860
Yeah, it's kind of a big deal, too.

23:16.870 --> 23:19.539
Sometimes they replay the sets on KCRW.

23:19.540 --> 23:21.960
It could get you a lot of attention.

23:23.250 --> 23:25.299
Well, could I get a second date?

23:43.710 --> 23:47.950
My brother, Dom, dropped off
a letter from my mother.

23:47.960 --> 23:50.340
I don't know if I should read it.

23:51.620 --> 23:54.380
I just wish she'd stop
trying to get me to see her.

23:57.170 --> 23:58.240
You know, my birth mom

23:58.280 --> 24:00.840
contacted me on Facebook
when I was, like, 15.

24:00.900 --> 24:03.200
Said she wanted to see me, but...

24:03.240 --> 24:04.940
really she just wanted money for drugs.

24:04.960 --> 24:06.960
Yeah, sounds familiar.

24:08.060 --> 24:12.200
Dom says she's clean, wants
to make amends, but...

24:12.260 --> 24:14.360
You know, it's actually kinda funny

24:14.370 --> 24:16.900
because I wanted to
give up on Ana, but...

24:16.910 --> 24:18.780
my brother, Jesus, wanted to...

24:18.790 --> 24:21.700
give her a chance to get it together.

24:21.710 --> 24:23.900
And eventually she did.

24:23.910 --> 24:27.500
And I have to say, it was
really healing for all of us.

24:28.440 --> 24:29.860
But...

24:29.870 --> 24:32.840
you don't have to do anything
you don't want to do.

24:44.540 --> 24:47.260
I filed a sexual harassment
complaint against Judge Handelman.

24:48.910 --> 24:51.080
I just wanted to let you
know since you were involved

24:51.100 --> 24:53.200
in my transfer to your office.

24:53.240 --> 24:54.990
I suspect...

24:55.000 --> 24:57.860
the internal investigation
will go nowhere.

24:57.870 --> 25:00.870
Who's going to believe a
clerk over a tenured judge?

25:03.640 --> 25:07.820
But, it's something I
needed to do for myself,

25:07.830 --> 25:12.450
as well as for any new
clerks who might be...

25:12.460 --> 25:15.020
vulnerable to him.

25:17.290 --> 25:19.400
I commend you coming forward.

25:19.420 --> 25:22.710
I know it... takes a lot of courage.

25:26.160 --> 25:27.860
Well, if you know...

25:27.870 --> 25:29.340
if something wrong is happening,

25:29.360 --> 25:31.950
and you don't do something about it...

25:31.960 --> 25:33.460
especially if...

25:33.720 --> 25:36.700
you know someone else
might be victimized?

25:36.710 --> 25:37.820
You're as responsible

25:37.830 --> 25:39.780
as the perpetrator.

25:39.790 --> 25:42.520
Even more so if you're
in a position of power.

25:44.700 --> 25:46.599
Right?

25:50.960 --> 25:52.580
Yeah?

25:56.080 --> 25:57.920
I came to see Mom.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.040
You came.

26:07.140 --> 26:10.720
My baby girl, let me
get a good look at ya.

26:10.790 --> 26:12.410
Yeah...

26:14.540 --> 26:17.210
I'm sorry I can't get up, I...

26:18.170 --> 26:21.280
got this, uh, swellin'
in my feet, and...

26:21.290 --> 26:24.320
neuropathy... I can hardly
move up out this chair.

26:24.700 --> 26:27.099
Doctors can't get my meds right.

26:27.100 --> 26:30.160
You have no idea how
I've suffered, Mika.

26:32.410 --> 26:34.320
But your brother knows.

26:34.330 --> 26:37.900
He's been a good son.
He takes care of me.

26:39.543 --> 26:42.820
So, I'm doing good,
Mom, thanks for asking.

26:42.880 --> 26:45.360
Well, you sure look good.

26:45.440 --> 26:48.300
You must be makin' money
to dress like that.

26:50.380 --> 26:52.140
I'm bartending and going to school,

26:52.170 --> 26:54.040
so money's actually pretty tight.

26:54.060 --> 26:55.319
You read my letter?

26:55.320 --> 26:57.400
No.

27:00.340 --> 27:02.060
Thought it might be
better for you to say

27:02.080 --> 27:03.560
whatever you want to me in person.

27:05.040 --> 27:06.300
I see...

27:08.100 --> 27:12.700
Well... I don't know how much
longer I have on God's green earth.

27:12.710 --> 27:14.840
- Oh.
- Stop talkin' like that.

27:14.940 --> 27:19.179
The point is, before I die,
I just want you to know...

27:19.180 --> 27:20.820
Malika...

27:20.840 --> 27:23.360
that I forgive you.

27:46.850 --> 27:47.940
Oh, hey.

27:47.950 --> 27:49.640
I'm almost done with the invites...

27:49.680 --> 27:51.060
I heard your radio show.

27:51.100 --> 27:53.280
Oh. Uh... what'd you think?

27:53.290 --> 27:55.059
I think you suck.

27:55.060 --> 27:57.360
Honestly, what if Sumi had
been listening to that?

27:57.370 --> 27:59.000
How could you be that insensitive?!

27:59.020 --> 28:01.100
Especially considering what a
good friend she's been to you.

28:01.120 --> 28:05.300
Okay, after what a good
friend she's been to me?!

28:05.380 --> 28:06.719
- Yeah.
- Really?!

28:06.720 --> 28:09.780
I'm sitting here, planning her
wedding and her bridal shower.

28:09.790 --> 28:11.820
And talk about insensitive.

28:19.910 --> 28:21.280
Will you get over that?!

28:21.290 --> 28:22.950
We were not broken up

28:22.960 --> 28:24.199
when you guys cheated on me!

28:24.200 --> 28:26.440
I did not cheat on you! She did!

28:26.470 --> 28:28.540
Okay, and I do not think
that the world is flat.

28:31.240 --> 28:32.360
What's going on?

28:33.960 --> 28:35.740
Uh... just arguing.

28:35.750 --> 28:38.740
Yeah, I know...

28:38.830 --> 28:40.540
about what?

28:44.290 --> 28:46.040
Um, about what games to play.

28:47.800 --> 28:49.420
We, uh,

28:49.460 --> 28:51.200
were gonna throw you a
surprise bridal shower.

28:51.210 --> 28:53.420
Heh, surprise!

28:54.960 --> 28:56.950
I'm so excited!

28:56.960 --> 29:00.400
Oh, oh, oh... we have to
play the toilet paper game.

29:01.460 --> 29:02.860
- It's a classic.
- Yeah.

29:02.880 --> 29:04.000
Where are we throwing it?

29:04.020 --> 29:05.720
I have ideas!

29:09.410 --> 29:10.460
Malika...

29:15.460 --> 29:20.420
I forgive you for doing what
you think you had to do.

29:20.500 --> 29:24.280
And for all the pain it
caused me to lose my babies.

29:27.260 --> 29:29.040
I forgive you.

29:31.370 --> 29:34.070
Thank you for forgiving me, Mom.

29:34.080 --> 29:36.080
I'm working on forgiving you, too.

29:39.480 --> 29:41.020
Well, I appreciate that.

29:42.920 --> 29:46.680
I know you and me never
did quite get on.

29:46.710 --> 29:49.660
But I always loved you, Mika.

29:49.670 --> 29:53.280
And you know why I
started with the drugs.

29:53.290 --> 29:55.860
I was working two full-time jobs,

29:55.870 --> 29:57.990
to put a roof over y'alls heads.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.420
I needed something to help me focus

30:00.440 --> 30:01.520
workin' around the clock.

30:01.530 --> 30:04.040
So, what about when you lost those jobs?

30:04.050 --> 30:05.150
Because you were showing up high,

30:05.180 --> 30:06.900
- or not at all?
- Why you gotta go there?

30:06.910 --> 30:08.950
It's okay, Dom.

30:08.960 --> 30:11.780
You don't know how hard it
was as a single mother.

30:11.790 --> 30:14.990
But I was getting myself
together when you called

30:15.000 --> 30:17.030
the Child Protective Services.

30:17.040 --> 30:18.560
I had a job

30:18.580 --> 30:21.030
lined up... I don't think
you remember that.

30:21.040 --> 30:23.000
But the utilities weren't paid.

30:23.020 --> 30:25.780
That's why they took you, why
they said the home was unfit.

30:25.790 --> 30:28.360
They never said I was unfit.

30:28.460 --> 30:29.950
And I fought...

30:29.960 --> 30:32.450
to get you both back, I did.

30:32.460 --> 30:34.700
But... and I'm not blamin' you,

30:34.780 --> 30:36.840
but when you called them on me,

30:36.880 --> 30:39.210
it just made it that much harder.

30:40.940 --> 30:42.920
But that's all water under the bridge.

30:42.930 --> 30:47.380
And I think if we can
both admit we were wrong,

30:47.440 --> 30:49.870
and say to each other we're sorry...

30:51.370 --> 30:53.580
maybe we can start over.

30:56.320 --> 30:58.320
I'll go first.

31:00.600 --> 31:02.910
I was wrong, Mika.

31:04.500 --> 31:06.750
And I'm sorry.

31:19.340 --> 31:22.410
I was wrong and I'm sorry, Mom.

31:24.620 --> 31:26.030
That's my girl.

31:28.830 --> 31:31.580
Thank you for comin'. I hate to ask,

31:31.600 --> 31:35.040
but your brother's supportin' us
and he sure could use some help

31:35.060 --> 31:37.490
from his sister.

31:37.660 --> 31:39.580
Don't be a stranger, now.

31:44.620 --> 31:46.480
Thanks for comin'.

32:15.180 --> 32:17.360
- What're you still doin' here?
- Beer.

32:17.400 --> 32:19.320
Hey, what's in the bag, Dom?

32:19.330 --> 32:21.320
Oh, let me guess, Honey Jack.

32:21.340 --> 32:23.320
She's in a lotta pain, okay?

32:23.330 --> 32:26.400
- You said she was sober.
- I said she was clean of the drugs.

32:26.410 --> 32:28.140
If I'm not out there
getting the booze for her,

32:28.160 --> 32:29.780
then she gonna be out there
tryna get it herself.

32:29.790 --> 32:32.379
You said she was sober.

32:32.380 --> 32:34.279
I found her...

32:34.280 --> 32:37.780
So, all of that in there, that apology,

32:37.800 --> 32:38.900
that was to get money out of me?

32:38.920 --> 32:39.950
- No!
- For this?!

32:39.960 --> 32:41.780
No, no, she wants a relationship

32:41.790 --> 32:42.800
with you.

32:42.820 --> 32:44.570
She wants us to be a family.

32:44.580 --> 32:46.440
No, that is all bullshit, Dom!

32:47.860 --> 32:51.640
They didn't take us away because
she couldn't keep the lights on.

32:51.720 --> 32:54.560
They took us away because
she was strung out

32:54.660 --> 32:56.740
and unfit to take care of us.

32:56.750 --> 32:59.300
Psst. What'd you say you
were sorry for, then?

33:00.800 --> 33:02.820
For you.

33:05.340 --> 33:09.900
We weren't safe, and I am not
sorry that I called CPS.

33:09.910 --> 33:12.080
I am not sorry!

33:12.100 --> 33:13.960
- Chill!
- She is guilting you

33:14.040 --> 33:16.160
into taking care of her!

33:16.220 --> 33:19.240
Enabling her, just like she
did when you were little.

33:19.250 --> 33:22.210
- She's the only mother we got!
- That is not true!

33:23.480 --> 33:25.320
You can find other mothers out there.

33:25.330 --> 33:27.400
- What do y...
- People who will be there for you.

33:27.760 --> 33:30.660
Giving birth to you, that
doesn't make her your mother.

33:30.700 --> 33:33.160
Taking care of your
kid, that's what does.

33:35.200 --> 33:36.910
Dom?

33:39.870 --> 33:41.860
Don't go in.

33:41.870 --> 33:43.780
Come on, Dom.

34:13.239 --> 34:14.440
Hey.

34:14.500 --> 34:16.219
Hey.

34:16.300 --> 34:19.018
I'm just here to pick up
the forms for Jazmin.

34:19.020 --> 34:20.620
Uh, yeah, sure.

34:22.639 --> 34:25.530
So, when can I expect to see
your abs for sale on Instagram?

34:25.540 --> 34:28.159
Yeah, did Mariana tell you about that?

34:28.170 --> 34:30.400
Yeah... you know I'm a...

34:30.409 --> 34:31.780
pretty decent photographer.

34:31.790 --> 34:35.120
Might even have a better eye than
Bryan for that kind of thing.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.520
What's that supposed to mean?

34:38.830 --> 34:40.030
I don't know.

34:40.040 --> 34:42.540
- Just that...
- Why'd you come up here, Callie?

34:43.440 --> 34:44.949
To pick up the forms.

34:44.960 --> 34:46.320
Really?

34:46.480 --> 34:47.909
'Cause it...

34:47.909 --> 34:50.239
kind of feels like you just
came up here to flirt with me.

34:50.340 --> 34:52.440
I mean, I could have
brought 'em down to you.

34:53.670 --> 34:54.860
Sorry.

34:54.870 --> 34:56.699
Remember why you broke things off?

34:56.760 --> 34:58.460
You kept comin' up here,

34:58.520 --> 35:00.480
'cause I was the distraction.

35:01.300 --> 35:02.920
And now it's...

35:02.960 --> 35:04.660
some papers.

35:05.740 --> 35:07.410
I'll text next time.

35:09.860 --> 35:11.820
It's interesting how...

35:11.830 --> 35:15.360
the second you're done playing
out your Latino lover fantasy,

35:15.460 --> 35:16.900
you have time for...

35:16.910 --> 35:19.060
good ol', All-American Jamie.

35:19.080 --> 35:21.570
Wasn't I also a distraction
in this equation?

35:21.640 --> 35:24.340
From all the art you're
supposed to be working on?

35:24.380 --> 35:27.160
I mean, Bryan seems to be here a
lot. Is he helping you with that?

35:27.220 --> 35:29.070
Yeah, actually, he is.

35:29.080 --> 35:30.780
Bryan cares about me...

35:30.790 --> 35:33.220
... and my feelings. He doesn't just

35:33.240 --> 35:34.500
sneak up here in the middle of the night

35:34.520 --> 35:37.140
to use me for sex and then try
and hide it from everyone.

35:37.220 --> 35:39.860
I'm sorry I made you feel that way.

35:39.870 --> 35:41.920
I'm sure selling your
sexuality on Instagram

35:41.940 --> 35:43.030
will make you feel much better.

35:43.040 --> 35:45.699
Look, you have no idea what
it's like navigating the world

35:45.700 --> 35:47.860
as a queer person of color.

35:47.870 --> 35:49.220
But then...

35:49.260 --> 35:51.820
you only see the world
according to Callie.

36:16.560 --> 36:18.910
Rebecca left the job early.

36:19.830 --> 36:21.060
Why?

36:23.580 --> 36:25.660
Morning.

36:25.670 --> 36:27.580
Callie, a word?

36:42.040 --> 36:46.120
_

36:46.200 --> 36:51.980
_

36:54.930 --> 36:58.320
_

37:01.630 --> 37:04.140
_

37:07.570 --> 37:12.680
_

37:14.280 --> 37:18.560
_

37:23.440 --> 37:26.120
Rebecca filed a complaint
against Judge Handelman.

37:27.360 --> 37:30.680
I also have filed a complaint against
Handelman to the Chief Justice

37:30.700 --> 37:33.370
asking for his removal from the
bench, not just a censure.

37:35.830 --> 37:37.990
Is that why Rebecca left early?

37:38.000 --> 37:41.070
No, she asked to leave early
because she's accepted a job

37:41.080 --> 37:42.799
with The Lassiter Group in Denver.

37:42.800 --> 37:44.500
Wanted some time to
spend with her family.

37:45.440 --> 37:48.740
You're very persuasive, Callie.

37:48.750 --> 37:50.699
It's a great quality in a lawyer.

37:53.540 --> 37:56.110
I hope my bench memo has
persuaded you to allow

37:56.120 --> 37:59.210
Jamal's attorneys to see Officer
Griffin's personnel files.

38:01.260 --> 38:02.860
I'm still deliberating.

38:02.870 --> 38:04.950
I'll rule on it this
afternoon at the hearing.

38:04.960 --> 38:06.240
Get to work.

38:27.830 --> 38:29.700
Callie...

38:29.760 --> 38:32.340
I'm sorry for leaving
without saying goodbye.

38:32.360 --> 38:35.720
But you know I'm not exactly
the sentimental type.

38:35.800 --> 38:38.340
I'm making an exception with this note,

38:38.370 --> 38:41.110
but don't worry, I'll keep it short.

38:41.120 --> 38:42.780
You were right.

38:42.790 --> 38:44.660
Kate doesn't have a grandfather who can

38:44.670 --> 38:46.420
get her a clerkship with another judge.

38:46.440 --> 38:50.070
But before you get too proud
of yourself, that's...

38:50.080 --> 38:52.410
not the only reason I filed a complaint.

38:53.540 --> 38:56.979
I realized that as long as I
allow my family connections

38:56.980 --> 39:00.450
to get me jobs, and open doors,

39:00.460 --> 39:03.110
no one will believe I
deserve to be where I am.

39:03.120 --> 39:05.399
That I've ever earned anything.

39:05.400 --> 39:06.720
_

39:06.740 --> 39:09.070
I won't be my own person
until I have the courage

39:09.080 --> 39:12.820
to stop being who my
family wants me to be.

39:12.830 --> 39:15.540
I never thought I'd say this, but...

39:15.580 --> 39:17.780
thank you.

39:17.790 --> 39:19.680
For challenging me.

39:19.780 --> 39:21.820
In so many ways, but...

39:21.830 --> 39:25.280
mostly, to be a more independent
thinker and to define myself

39:25.300 --> 39:26.860
on my own terms.

39:26.870 --> 39:30.950
I still disagree with you
on your liberal politics...

39:30.960 --> 39:35.400
but I admire your
conviction and your ethics.

39:35.480 --> 39:38.320
Which is why your
secret is safe with me.

39:38.330 --> 39:40.320
I know you won't cross the
line of what's appropriate,

39:40.340 --> 39:43.660
in spite of your intimate
living situation.

39:43.680 --> 39:47.490
Tell Ben goodbye and
to go to hell for me.

39:47.500 --> 39:49.280
And if you're ever in Denver,

39:49.290 --> 39:50.830
let's have a drink.

39:51.870 --> 39:55.210
Yours Truly, Rebecca.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.580
I didn't get a letter.

40:07.940 --> 40:10.960
All rise for the Honorable
Judge Curtis Wilson.

40:12.940 --> 40:15.250
Oh, look, your friend's here.

40:20.540 --> 40:21.950
Thank you for coming.

40:30.910 --> 40:33.620
I'm happy to show up for the
people who show up for me.

40:34.830 --> 40:35.870
Thank you.

40:36.870 --> 40:38.360
I've reached my decision

40:38.370 --> 40:40.740
concerning the defense's
motion to redact

40:40.750 --> 40:42.950
Officer Griffin's personnel records.

40:42.960 --> 40:45.220
That motion has been granted.

40:45.240 --> 40:48.160
The records will remain sealed.

40:48.170 --> 40:50.570
Wilson's son is facing
charges in Berkeley.

40:50.580 --> 40:53.820
And the new chief has strong ties
to that department, and the D.A.

40:53.880 --> 40:56.030
I don't think you can
prove that Wilson is...

40:56.040 --> 40:58.820
feeling pressure to go easy
on the LAPD as a result.

40:58.830 --> 41:01.760
Unless the new chief didn't want
a big ruling against the LAPD

41:01.770 --> 41:03.900
the first month of his job,

41:03.910 --> 41:07.540
you know, he could use Tate's
situation to lean on Wilson.

41:07.750 --> 41:09.780
You think Wilson can be bought?
