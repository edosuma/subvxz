WEBVTT

00:00.768 --> 00:01.835
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:01.869 --> 00:02.970
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
I HAVE TO START DATING.

00:03.003 --> 00:06.507
THE SEX WITH IZZIE--IT'S LIKE
SHE'S TRYING TOO HARD.

00:06.540 --> 00:08.542
I GOT FIRED.
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH YOU
AND YOUR SISTER ANYWAY?

00:08.576 --> 00:11.045
(Meredith)
SHE'S NOT MY SISTER.
(Lexie) WE HAVE THE SAME DAD.

00:11.079 --> 00:13.514
YOU KILLED MY WIFE.
YOU TOOK HER FROM ME.

00:13.547 --> 00:16.184
WHAT DO YOU NEED,
SCOTCH, VODKA, GIN?
JUST DON'T TELL MEREDITH.

00:17.585 --> 00:20.054
(Meredith) THERE COMES
A POINT IN YOUR LIFE

00:20.088 --> 00:22.790
WHEN YOU'RE OFFICIALLY
AN ADULT.

00:22.823 --> 00:25.126
SUDDENLY YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH
TO VOTE, DRINK

00:25.159 --> 00:28.529
AND ENGAGE
IN OTHER ADULT ACTIVITIES.

00:28.562 --> 00:31.799
SO... WHY THE BRAIN?

00:31.832 --> 00:34.135
WHY BIOLOGY'S CROWN JEWEL?

00:34.168 --> 00:36.804
YOU MEAN WHY DID I
GO INTO NEUROSURGERY?

00:36.837 --> 00:38.539
COME ON. SHARE.
SHARE WITH SYDNEY.

00:38.572 --> 00:41.275
IT WAS THE HEADSET
WITH THE MAGNIFYING GLASSES

00:41.309 --> 00:43.577
THAT TIPPED THE SCALE
FOR ME.

00:43.611 --> 00:45.579
(laughs) AND THE MAN HAS
A SENSE OF HUMOR.

00:45.613 --> 00:47.248
(chuckles)

00:47.281 --> 00:48.616
I LIKE THAT.

00:48.649 --> 00:51.419
SUDDENLY PEOPLE EXPECT YOU
TO BE RESPONSIBLE...

00:51.452 --> 00:53.487
SERIOUS, A GROWN-UP.
(sighs)

00:53.521 --> 00:55.089
(pager beeps)
OH.

00:55.123 --> 00:56.824
OH.
WORK STUFF.

00:56.857 --> 00:59.593
UH-OH.
UM, AS IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW.
I'LL JUST BE A SEC.

00:59.627 --> 01:01.229
OH.

01:01.262 --> 01:03.231
***

01:03.264 --> 01:05.133
I THINK THEY'RE ON A DATE.

01:05.166 --> 01:06.600
THAT'S DEFINITELY A DATE,
RIGHT?

01:06.634 --> 01:08.502
MAYBE SHE'S DYING.

01:08.536 --> 01:10.871
IS SHE DYING?
IS THAT WHY?
OH, COME ON. GROW UP.

01:10.904 --> 01:13.874
SHE'S NICE. SHE ASKED ME OUT.
WANT ME
TO FAKE A HEART ATTACK?

01:13.907 --> 01:16.444
I DO
A GREAT FAKE HEART ATTACK.
HERE SHE COMES.

01:16.477 --> 01:19.247
CARRY ON.
IT'S SYDNEY.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.849
IN THE MOVIES, WHEN THE HANDSOME
BUT SENSITIVE FOOTBALL PLAYER

01:21.882 --> 01:23.451
KISSES THE AWKWARD,
FREAKY GIRL

01:23.484 --> 01:26.454
IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE SCHOOL--
THAT GIRL IS HER.

01:26.487 --> 01:28.622
YOU ARE VERY AWKWARD
AND FREAKY.

01:28.656 --> 01:31.125
(Sydney and Derek laugh)

01:31.159 --> 01:34.128
WE GET TALLER,

01:34.162 --> 01:37.298
WE GET OLDER...

01:37.331 --> 01:38.566
***

01:38.599 --> 01:41.635
BUT DO WE EVER REALLY GROW UP?

01:41.669 --> 01:44.905
***

01:44.938 --> 01:46.907
DO YOU KNOW WHAT KIND
OF BATTERIES THESE TAKE?

01:46.940 --> 01:49.210
DOUBLE "A."
IS IT REALLY?

01:49.243 --> 01:51.312
DO YOU HAVE ONE?

01:51.345 --> 01:53.581
I HAVE SOME IN MY LOCKER.
YEAH.

01:53.614 --> 01:56.517
***

01:56.550 --> 02:00.454
WE'RE AVOIDING THEM NOW.
IT'S COME TO THAT.

02:00.488 --> 02:02.523
WHY ARE YOU AVOIDING IZZIE?

02:02.556 --> 02:04.325
IT'S LIKE
WE'RE NOT US ANYMORE.

02:04.358 --> 02:06.194
EVERYTHING USED TO BE SO EASY.

02:06.227 --> 02:08.196
TALKING AT LEAST
USED TO BE EASY.

02:08.229 --> 02:10.398
NOW LOOK. WE CAN'T
EVEN TALK ANYMORE.

02:10.431 --> 02:12.633
OH, DEREK WENT ON A DATE
WITH SYDNEY HERON LAST NIGHT.

02:12.666 --> 02:15.336
IT WAS PROBABLY A FAKE DATE
TO MAKE ME THINK HE'S HEALTHY

02:15.369 --> 02:17.405
AND MOVING ON.
AND DO YOU THINK
HE'S HEALTHY AND MOVING ON?

02:17.438 --> 02:20.208
CAN WE JUST TAKE THE STAIRS?
OKAY.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.280
BAILEY...

02:26.314 --> 02:27.915
I, UH...

02:27.948 --> 02:30.284
JUST, UH,
I WANTED TO CONGRATULATE YOU.

02:30.318 --> 02:32.186
I'M SORRY IF THINGS GOT--

02:32.220 --> 02:34.588
YOU DESERVE THE JOB.
OH, DOES SHE EVER.

02:34.622 --> 02:36.590
COME HERE,
NEW CHIEF RESIDENT. HUH?

02:36.624 --> 02:40.294
SOMEONE DESERVES A BIG HUG.
(laughs)
OH, COME ON, SYDNEY.

02:40.328 --> 02:42.296
WELL, I ADMIT, I'M A--
I'M A WEE BIT JEALOUS.

02:42.330 --> 02:44.632
BUT THE CHIEF
HAS MADE HIS DECISION,

02:44.665 --> 02:46.634
AND I WILL ABIDE BY IT.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.537
OH, CALLIE, I'M, UH,
I'M SO SORRY.
I'M FINE WITH IT.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.939
OH, GOOD. WE'RE BEING
A-A BRAVE SOLDIER.

02:51.972 --> 02:55.476
NO, REALLY.
I'M FINE WITH IT.

02:55.509 --> 02:58.946
LET'S NOT SPOIL THIS MOMENT
FOR MIRANDA. OKAY?

02:58.979 --> 03:00.981
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP.

03:01.014 --> 03:04.985
I HAVE NOTHING BUT RESPECT
FOR THE JOB DONE BY DR. TORRES,

03:05.018 --> 03:07.688
BUT THINGS ARE GONNA BE
DIFFERENT FROM HERE ON IN.

03:07.721 --> 03:09.690
(whispering) THINGS ARE TOTALLY
WEIRD BETWEEN GEORGE AND ME.

03:09.723 --> 03:11.692
WE CAN'T EVEN HOLD
A NORMAL CONVERSATION.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.561
THIS WILL BE
A PROFESSIONAL ENVIRONMENT.

03:13.594 --> 03:16.330
SO YOUR LOVE LIVES,
YOUR HOPES AND DREAMS,

03:16.364 --> 03:18.732
THE LITTLE JOYS AND TRAGEDIES
THAT MAKE YOU WHO YOU ARE

03:18.766 --> 03:20.701
HAVE NO PLACE IN MY HOSPITAL.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.736
HE'S ACTING
LIKE A TOTAL STRANGER,

03:22.770 --> 03:24.738
LIKE I DON'T EVEN KNOW HIM.

03:24.772 --> 03:27.675
THE LOCKER ROOM IS FOR CHANGING,
NOT FOR CRYING.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.577
THE ON CALL ROOM
IS FOR NAPPING,

03:29.610 --> 03:31.745
NOT FOR ANYTHING THAT REQUIRES
A LOCKED DOOR.

03:31.779 --> 03:34.282
OH, MY GOD. DON'T EVEN
GET ME STARTED ON THE SEX.

03:34.315 --> 03:36.350
IT IS JUST TRAGIC.
IT'S LIKE--

03:36.384 --> 03:39.353
STEVENS, DID YOU HEAR
A WORD I SAID?

03:39.387 --> 03:42.990
GROW UP, I BELIEVE,
IS MY POINT.

03:43.023 --> 03:45.593
(Cristina) UH, DR. BAILEY,
UM, CAN YOU MAKE SURE

03:45.626 --> 03:47.795
I STAY ON DR. HAHN'S
CARDIO SERVICE?
ALREADY DONE.

03:47.828 --> 03:50.631
BUT IF YOU PISS HER OFF
OR MESS UP

03:50.664 --> 03:53.000
OR IN ANY WAY EMBARRASS ME,
THAT'S IT, NO MORE CHANCES.

03:53.033 --> 03:54.602
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

03:54.635 --> 03:56.604
I WILL BE THE BEST RESIDENT
SHE'S EVER HAD.

03:56.637 --> 03:58.772
NO, YANG, I WILL BE THE BEST
RESIDENT SHE'S EVER HAD.

03:58.806 --> 04:00.574
YES, RIGHT. SECOND TO YOU.

04:00.608 --> 04:02.743
HIS INCISION
IS HEALING NICELY.

04:02.776 --> 04:05.279
NO ERYTHEMA
OR PURULENT DISCHARGE.

04:05.313 --> 04:08.649
HE'LL BE MONITORED, AND WE'LL
TRY WEANING HIM OFF THE DRIP

04:08.682 --> 04:10.451
ONCE HIS MEDS ARE MAXIMIZED.
AFTER DISCHARGE,

04:10.484 --> 04:13.621
WE EXPECT HIM TO FOLLOW UP
IN THE CARDIAC CLINIC.
THERE ARE FOUR
OTHER PEOPLE HERE, YANG.

04:13.654 --> 04:17.024
HOW ABOUT
LETTING ONE OF THEM TALK?

04:17.057 --> 04:19.827
UH...

04:19.860 --> 04:21.829
MR. TALBOT'S CARDIOMYOPATHY
IS UNUSUALLY COMPLICATED,

04:21.862 --> 04:23.597
THAT'S ALL.

04:23.631 --> 04:25.799
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD TAKE
A CUE FROM DR. STEVENS.

04:25.833 --> 04:29.036
SHE KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH HER PATIENTS,

04:29.069 --> 04:31.505
AND SHE'S INCLUSIVE.
(pagers beeping)

04:31.539 --> 04:33.507
WHAT DO WE GOT?
HIGH SCHOOL BUS CRASH.

04:33.541 --> 04:36.377
BUNCH OF KIDS JUST CAME IN.
WE GOT MORE ON THE WAY.

04:36.410 --> 04:38.379
TRICIA HALE, 17,
VITAL SIGNS STABLE.

04:38.412 --> 04:39.813
SUSTAINED A LARGE
FACIAL LACERATION,

04:39.847 --> 04:41.382
TRAUMA TO THE BUTTOCK AREA

04:41.415 --> 04:43.384
AND AN OPEN FRACTURE
TO THE LOWER RIGHT LEG.

04:43.417 --> 04:44.785
OKAY, TRAUMA ROOM TWO.

04:44.818 --> 04:47.588
IT'S STILL BLEEDING.
MY FACE IS STILL BLEEDING.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.857
ALL RIGHT. WE'LL GET TO THAT
IN A MINUTE, OKAY?

04:49.890 --> 04:51.725
WE? NO, TRY THE HEAD
OF PLASTIC SURGERY.

04:51.759 --> 04:53.727
NO ONE IS TOUCHING MY FACE
UNTIL I'VE SPOKEN

04:53.761 --> 04:55.796
TO THE HEAD
OF PLASTIC SURGERY--NO ONE.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.831
34-YEAR-OLD PASSENGER
MARCUS KING,

04:57.865 --> 05:00.801
NO COMPLAINTS EXCEPT DEEP CUTS
ON HIS LEFT ARM.

05:00.834 --> 05:02.803
STABLE ON ROUTE.

05:02.836 --> 05:05.773
(Marcus) LISTEN, I'M FINE.
PLEASE HELP THE KIDS FIRST.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.741
THEY'RE BEING TAKEN CARE OF,
SIR. WHAT HAPPENED?

05:07.775 --> 05:10.611
I WAS TAKING THE KIDS
ON A TOUR OF COLLEGES.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.346
WE'RE FROM CALIFORNIA.

05:12.380 --> 05:14.648
THE BUS SLID DOWN
AN EMBANKMENT.

05:14.682 --> 05:17.651
(George) ONE, TWO, THREE.

05:17.685 --> 05:20.888
MANDI?

05:20.921 --> 05:22.756
MANDI!

05:22.790 --> 05:23.857
MARCUS?

05:25.926 --> 05:27.628
MANDI?

05:30.398 --> 05:31.699
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

05:31.732 --> 05:32.866
DANNY.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.902
HEY, UH, DANNY,
I'M GONNA TAKE THIS OFF

05:34.935 --> 05:37.337
SO I CAN HAVE A LOOK,
OKAY?

05:49.550 --> 05:56.557
MAN, HIGH SCHOOL
REALLY DOES SUCK.

06:02.763 --> 06:05.699
IT WAS THAT ASSHAT SULLY
AND HIS STUPID FRIENDS!
SHH.

06:05.733 --> 06:07.868
THE DRIVER KEPT TURNING AROUND,
TELLING THEM TO SHUT UP--

06:07.901 --> 06:10.571
I'M JUST DRAWING A LOGO,
AND SUDDENLY I'M UPSIDE-DOWN.

06:10.604 --> 06:13.474
AND THE PENCIL WENT, LIKE,
ALL THE WAY IN DANNY'S EYE.
YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.

06:13.507 --> 06:16.143
SHOULD I CALL HIS PARENTS?
WHY DON'T YOU
LET US DO THAT?

06:16.176 --> 06:18.211
SULLY AND THOSE JERKS
SHOULD BE IN JAIL.

06:18.245 --> 06:20.914
YOU SHOULD BE CALLING
THE POLICE, NOT MY PARENTS.
YOU JUST NEED TO NOT
THINK ABOUT THOSE KIDS, OKAY?

06:20.948 --> 06:23.451
YOU'RE GONNA BE
OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL SOON.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.586
YOU NEVER
HAVE TO SEE 'EM AGAIN.
OH, YEAH. I STILL GOTTA FINISH.

06:25.619 --> 06:28.489
DANNY, YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN.
OKAY? 'CAUSE WHEN YOU RAISE

06:28.522 --> 06:30.190
YOUR VOICE WHEN YOU GET UPSET,
YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE SHOOTS UP,

06:30.223 --> 06:32.860
AND YOU COULD LOSE YOUR EYE.
I NEED YOU TO STAY CALM.
OKAY, I'LL TRY.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.629
LISTEN, I REALLY CAN'T FEEL
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

06:35.663 --> 06:38.198
BUT I HOPE YOU'RE NOT LEAVING
A BIG, OL' SCAR.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.199
(laughing)

06:39.232 --> 06:41.869
(laughs) NO, NO. NO, NO.

06:41.902 --> 06:46.173
JUST A FEW LITTLE STITCHES. I DO
STITCHES ALL THE TIME, SO...

06:46.206 --> 06:48.175
DO YOU WANT ME TO TAKE OVER,
DR. BAILEY?

06:48.208 --> 06:50.611
UH, NO, NO. I DO STITCHES
ALL THE TIME, O'MALLEY.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.613
I JUST THOUGHT WITH ALL THE MORE
SERIOUS INJURIES COMING IN,

06:52.646 --> 06:54.181
YOU'D WANT ME
TO TAKE OVER.

06:54.214 --> 06:56.617
I'M FINE HERE.
YOU'RE NOT THE BOSS OF ME.

06:56.650 --> 06:59.186
ACTUALLY, I'M THE BOSS OF HIM,
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW.

06:59.219 --> 07:00.821
I'M THE CHIEF RESIDENT.

07:00.854 --> 07:02.723
WHAT?
YEAH. (laughs)

07:02.756 --> 07:04.958
OH, MANDI.

07:04.992 --> 07:07.194
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
I'M NOT SURPRISED.

07:07.227 --> 07:08.996
HEY, DID YOU KNOW THAT WE
WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL TOGETHER?

07:09.029 --> 07:11.465
REALLY?
YEAH, YEAH.
AND THIS GIRL RIGHT HERE,

07:11.499 --> 07:13.200
SHE IS A GENIUS.

07:13.233 --> 07:15.569
USED TO HELP ME
WITH ALL MY HOMEWORK.

07:15.603 --> 07:17.771
JUST A FEW PAPERS.
(laughs) THAT'S ALL.

07:17.805 --> 07:19.006
OH. OOPS.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.809
DR. BAILEY.
I-I DO STITCHES
ALL THE TIME.

07:21.842 --> 07:24.812
I KNOW, BUT YOU MIGHT
WANT TO TAKE A LISTEN.
SOMETHING WRONG
WITH MY TICKER?

07:24.845 --> 07:27.481
OH, LET'S SEE.

07:27.515 --> 07:29.817
(laughs)

07:29.850 --> 07:30.984
OKAY.

07:31.018 --> 07:32.753
(laughs)

07:37.658 --> 07:42.696
UM, PART OF YOUR HEART, UH,
MAY BE WORKING OVERTIME,

07:42.730 --> 07:45.833
SO, I, UH,
WILL GET HIS E.K.G.

07:45.866 --> 07:47.234
AND PAGE HAHN.

07:47.267 --> 07:49.937
WILL YOU FINISH
THE SUTURES?

07:49.970 --> 07:52.706
OH, UH...
YOU CAN'T FINISH THIS?

07:54.274 --> 07:58.045
I... YES. I CAN DO IT.
SURE.

07:58.078 --> 08:01.014
I'LL DO IT.
YOU GO GET HAHN.

08:01.048 --> 08:02.683
(Marcus and Miranda laugh)

08:02.716 --> 08:04.251
OKAY.

08:04.284 --> 08:06.053
YOU BETTER BE ABLE
TO FIX MY FACE.

08:06.086 --> 08:08.556
I HAVE POM STATEWIDES
IN A MONTH.

08:08.589 --> 08:10.858
YOU'RE A CHEERLEADER?
(scoffs) I'M A POM.

08:10.891 --> 08:15.062
CHEERLEADERS JUST JUMP AROUND.
POMS ARE DANCERS.

08:15.095 --> 08:19.533
I WAS ON THE FOOTBALL TEAM.
YEAH, I'M NOT SURE YOU'RE
GONNA BE DOING ANY DANCING

08:19.567 --> 08:21.735
IN THE NEXT MONTH.
YOU BETTER BE LYING.

08:21.769 --> 08:24.304
NOT LYING. YOU HAVE VERY SERIOUS
KNEE AND LEG FRACTURES,

08:24.337 --> 08:26.273
NOT TO MENTION
A CRACKED COCCYX.

08:26.306 --> 08:27.741
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

08:27.775 --> 08:29.877
THAT'S THE BONE
AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SPINE.

08:29.910 --> 08:31.712
HUH?
THE BOTTOM OF YOUR BOTTOM.

08:31.745 --> 08:33.280
MY ASS?

08:33.313 --> 08:35.282
I BROKE MY ASS?

08:35.315 --> 08:37.685
THAT'S ONE WAY
TO LOOK AT IT.
DON'T LOOK AT IT.

08:37.718 --> 08:39.820
OKAY,
YOU'RE GONNA NEED SURGERY.

08:39.853 --> 08:42.089
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT
WE'LL PUT YOU UNDER

08:42.122 --> 08:45.092
SO THAT WE CAN FIX THE BONES
AND DR. SLOAN CAN FIX YOUR FACE

08:45.125 --> 08:46.760
ALL AT THE SAME TIME.

08:46.794 --> 08:48.328
YOU BETTER BE GOOD.

08:48.361 --> 08:51.665
BABY, YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND
ANYBODY BETTER THAN ME.

08:54.602 --> 08:58.038
(whispers) OH, MY GOD.
HOT CHEERLEADER ASS.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.306
(scoffs)

08:59.339 --> 09:02.042
TAKE A CUE FROM STEVENS.
FROM IZZIE STEVENS.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.577
SERIOUSLY?

09:03.611 --> 09:05.579
YOU NEED TO CUT IZZIE
SOME SLACK.

09:05.613 --> 09:07.581
HER AND GEORGE
ARE HAVING PROBLEMS.
ALREADY?

09:07.615 --> 09:08.849
IT'S ONLY BEEN A WEEK.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.584
AT THAT POINT,
YOU DON'T EVEN TALK.

09:10.618 --> 09:12.753
ALL YOU DO IS HAVE SEX.
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU CAN'T HAVE PROBLEMS.

09:12.786 --> 09:14.822
DEREK AND I ARE HAVING
ALL KINDS OF SEX,

09:14.855 --> 09:17.591
AND HE'S DATING OTHER PEOPLE.
YOU DIDN'T HEAR ANY OF THIS.

09:17.625 --> 09:19.559
OH, PLEASE.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.997
FINE. WHATEVER.

09:24.031 --> 09:25.999
YOU PAGED ME
BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T HANDLE

09:26.033 --> 09:29.002
A FEW STITCHES ON A WINO?
HE KEEPS HOLLERING
FOR DR. GREY.

09:29.036 --> 09:32.773
I WASN'T SURE IF I SHOULD GET
HER OR CALL THE COPS OR WHAT.

09:32.806 --> 09:35.943
(laughs) THAT'S NOT DR. GREY.
DR. GREY'S A GIRL.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.945
I WANT MY DAUGHTER!

09:37.978 --> 09:40.614
STAY HERE.
MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T LEAVE.

09:40.648 --> 09:42.616
(Thatcher) WOULD YOU PAGE--
WOULD YOU PAGE HER?

09:42.650 --> 09:43.851
KAREV.

09:43.884 --> 09:46.019
(lowered voice)
KEEP MEREDITH OUT OF IT.

09:46.053 --> 09:48.656
GET LEXIE.

09:48.689 --> 09:51.358
YES, SIR.
(Thatcher) G-R-E-Y!

09:51.391 --> 09:52.225
(groans)

09:52.259 --> 09:54.962
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT YOUR DAD.

09:54.995 --> 09:58.031
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T
WANT TO TALK ABOUT MY DAD.

09:58.065 --> 10:01.034
IN FACT, WE'RE NEVER GONNA
TALK ABOUT HIM AGAIN, OKAY?

10:01.068 --> 10:03.671
YOU HELPED ME OUT ONCE.
NOW IT'S OVER.

10:06.707 --> 10:09.109
I CAN'T BELIEVE I GOTTA
FILL OUT ALL THIS STUFF.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.378
I MEAN, A KID GETS
A BUMP ON THE HEAD,

10:11.411 --> 10:14.381
AND YOU'VE--YOU'VE PRACTICALLY
GOTTA WRITE A NOVEL?
(chuckles)

10:14.414 --> 10:17.150
(laughs) LISTEN, MANDI,
I KNOW YOU'RE REALLY BUSY,

10:17.184 --> 10:19.787
BUT IF THERE'S ANY CHANCE,
ANY CHANCE AT ALL

10:19.820 --> 10:23.657
YOU COULD HELP ME
WITH SOME OF THIS STUFF--
PATIENTS ARE SUPPOSED
TO FILL THOSE OUT.

10:23.691 --> 10:25.859
IT'S NOT REALLY
THE DOCTOR'S JOB.
YOU BE QUIET.

10:25.893 --> 10:27.360
WHAT?
UH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT,
MARCUS.

10:27.394 --> 10:30.163
WE'LL FIGURE OUT SOMETHING.
GOOD OL' MANDI.
YOU ALWAYS GOT MY BACK, HUH?

10:30.197 --> 10:31.765
YOU HUSH NOW.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.767
I HATE TO INTERRUPT
THE REMINISCING,

10:33.801 --> 10:35.969
BUT I AM TRYING
TO LISTEN HERE.

10:37.437 --> 10:39.673
(mouths words)
(snickers)

10:39.707 --> 10:41.809
YOU DO HAVE
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.

10:41.842 --> 10:45.846
BUT YOU'RE NOT SYMPTOMATIC,
SO THAT'S A GOOD SIGN.

10:45.879 --> 10:48.181
WE'LL START YOU
ON SOME BLOOD THINNERS

10:48.215 --> 10:51.018
AND DO AN OUTPATIENT WORKUP.

10:51.051 --> 10:54.421
A TREATMENT PLAN YOU COULD'VE
MADE YOURSELF, DR. BAILEY,

10:54.454 --> 10:56.990
IF YOU WEREN'T ACTING LIKE
SUCH A BLITHERING IDIOT.

11:00.894 --> 11:02.429
IN TROUBLE.

11:02.462 --> 11:04.231
OH, COME ON.
HUSH NOW, MARCUS KING.

11:04.264 --> 11:06.233
(laughs)

11:06.266 --> 11:08.468
HEY, YOU PAGED?
YEAH, YOUR DAD'S HERE.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.971
WHAT?
HE'S DRUNK, HE'S NOISY,

11:11.004 --> 11:13.206
AND YOU NEED TO TAKE HIM
OFF MY HANDS.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.442
I HAVE A BROKEN ASS
I HAVE TO GET BACK TO.
CALL LEXIE.

11:15.475 --> 11:17.444
I CALLED LEXIE.
SHE'S NOT COMING.

11:17.477 --> 11:19.980
AND THE NEXT PERSON
I'M GONNA CALL IS THE COPS...

11:20.013 --> 11:22.983
(Thatcher) GET OUT OF MY WAY.
LEAVE ME ALONE.
'CAUSE THE GUY'S READY
TO GET OUTTA HERE,

11:23.016 --> 11:24.885
AND THERE'S NO WAY
HE CAN DRIVE.
MEREDITH!

11:24.918 --> 11:27.821
(laughs) OH, GOSH.
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

11:27.855 --> 11:30.257
SEE! THAT'S HER.
MEREDITH GREY.

11:30.290 --> 11:33.861
(Thatcher laughs)

11:42.936 --> 11:44.171
I'M SORRY.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.206
I REALLY, REALLY AM.

11:46.239 --> 11:49.142
I'M SURE YOU ARE.
THE LAST TIME I WAS HERE,

11:49.176 --> 11:52.279
I SAID SOME...
TERRIBLE THINGS TO YOU.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.915
TELLING YOU NOT TO COME
TO SUSAN'S FUNERAL?

11:54.948 --> 11:56.917
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.
I-I...

11:56.950 --> 11:59.753
I KNOW YOU DID
EVERYTHING YOU COULD.

11:59.787 --> 12:01.021
WHAT I SAID TO YOU...

12:01.054 --> 12:04.324
I'LL REGRET IT
TILL THE DAY I DIE.

12:07.527 --> 12:10.764
IS UNACCEPTABLE, YEAH.

12:10.798 --> 12:12.966
BUT TODAY, UH...

12:13.000 --> 12:16.770
TODAY...
IS SUSAN'S BIRTHDAY--BIRTHDAY,

12:16.804 --> 12:18.071
AND I...

12:21.008 --> 12:23.176
SHOULD I GO GET LEXIE?

12:23.210 --> 12:26.246
NO. JUST YOU.

12:26.279 --> 12:29.316
I JUST WANT YOU.

12:29.349 --> 12:31.852
(machine whirring)

12:31.885 --> 12:33.921
I NEVER KNEW
WHAT TO SAY TO THEM.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.889
IN HIGH SCHOOL--
KIDS LIKE HIM--

12:35.923 --> 12:39.526
THEY WERE ALWAYS SO...
SEPARATE FROM THE REST OF US,

12:39.559 --> 12:42.295
YOU KNOW, ALONE.

12:42.329 --> 12:44.297
IT WASN'T LIKE THAT FOR ME.

12:44.331 --> 12:47.167
I... I WAS PROM QUEEN
AND CLASS VALEDICTORIAN.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.536
YEAH,
I WOULDN'T BROADCAST THAT.

12:49.569 --> 12:52.806
I HAD A GREAT GROUP
OF FRIENDS, YOU KNOW?

12:52.840 --> 12:54.141
NOT REALLY.

12:54.174 --> 12:55.542
(Derek) HEY.

12:55.575 --> 12:58.145
WELL, LET'S SEE
WHAT WE GOT HERE.

12:58.178 --> 12:59.212
(beep)

12:59.246 --> 13:01.348
OH, YOU SEE THAT,
DR. STEVENS?

13:01.381 --> 13:03.817
YEAH. LOOKS LIKE
THE PENCIL LIFTED UP

13:03.851 --> 13:06.253
ONE OF THE BRANCHES
OF THE A.C.A.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.989
IS THAT A-A BLEED?
MM-HMM. IT IS.
IT'S A LITTLE ONE.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.858
WE NEED TO GET
THAT PENCIL OUT OF THERE

13:10.891 --> 13:13.793
BEFORE IT GETS ANY BIGGER.
I'LL BOOK AN O.R.

13:17.030 --> 13:19.132
I AM NOT
A BLITHERING IDIOT.

13:19.166 --> 13:22.302
HAHN HAD NO RIGHT
TO SPEAK TO ME THAT WAY,

13:22.335 --> 13:24.571
NO RIGHT AT ALL.
BUT MARCUS ISN'T...

13:24.604 --> 13:26.573
WELL, HE'S JUST NOT
AN OLD FRIEND, IS HE?

13:26.606 --> 13:30.911
HE'S... HE WAS MAYBE
YOUR BOYFRIEND OR...

13:30.944 --> 13:33.113
YOU KNOW,
HIGH SCHOOL SWEETHEART OR...

13:33.146 --> 13:35.949
I WAS HIS TUTOR.
OH.

13:35.983 --> 13:37.951
OKAY? HE WAS A TRACK STAR,

13:37.985 --> 13:39.953
DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME
FOR HOMEWORK,

13:39.987 --> 13:42.589
SO I HELPED HIM
WITH HIS MATH AND READING...

13:42.622 --> 13:45.058
AND... FRENCH

13:45.092 --> 13:48.195
AND CHEMISTRY.

13:48.228 --> 13:51.298
THEN HE WAS JUST A FRIEND?

13:51.331 --> 13:54.001
REALLY?

13:54.034 --> 13:56.003
OKAY, THERE WAS SOME TALK,

13:56.036 --> 13:59.006
THE POSSIBILITY OF US GOING
TO THE HOMECOMING TOGETHER,

13:59.039 --> 14:01.008
BUT IT--IT DIDN'T WORK OUT,

14:01.041 --> 14:03.911
AND I WAS FINE WITH THAT.

14:03.944 --> 14:06.213
CERTAINLY NOT
A BLITHERING IDIOT...

14:06.246 --> 14:08.949
TODAY...

14:08.982 --> 14:12.052
NOR ANY OTHER DAY
IN MY LIFE.

14:14.254 --> 14:17.057
THESE AND THAT AND THAT.
THANK YOU.

14:17.090 --> 14:18.325
EXCUSE ME.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.393
IS IT ME,

14:20.427 --> 14:24.064
OR ARE THERE TEENYBOPPERS
STARING AT YOU?

14:24.097 --> 14:26.199
(girls giggle)
(Mark) I GET THAT A LOT.

14:26.233 --> 14:30.403
IT STARTED WHEN I WAS THERE AGE,
NEVER REALLY WENT AWAY.

14:30.437 --> 14:32.239
IS THAT SO?

14:32.272 --> 14:33.974
***

14:34.007 --> 14:35.976
NO.

14:36.009 --> 14:36.977
(girls giggle)

14:37.010 --> 14:40.080
WHAT CAN I DO
FOR YOU LADIES?

14:40.113 --> 14:42.215
TELL HIM.
NO, IT'S--
IT'S EMBARRASSING.

14:42.249 --> 14:44.417
YOU CAN TELL ME.

14:44.451 --> 14:46.987
YOU LOOK EXACTLY LIKE
HER DAD.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.021
(Richard chuckles)

14:48.055 --> 14:49.222
(laughs)

14:49.256 --> 14:51.959
(girls giggling)

14:51.992 --> 14:54.027
SWING AND A MISS.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.929
***

14:55.963 --> 14:58.298
I'M GOING CRAZY
WITH THIS HAHN THING.

14:58.331 --> 15:01.001
EVERY TIME I TRY
AND IMPRESS HER,

15:01.034 --> 15:04.071
SHE HATES ME EVEN MORE.

15:04.104 --> 15:06.073
***

15:06.106 --> 15:08.241
NOT WORTH
GETTING HUNG UP ON.

15:08.275 --> 15:10.077
WHY, DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

15:10.110 --> 15:12.079
APPARENTLY THEY'RE NOT EVEN
TALKING TO EACH OTHER

15:12.112 --> 15:14.247
AT THIS POINT.

15:14.281 --> 15:16.483
HMM. I KNOW IT'S WRONG,
BUT THAT MAKES ME FEEL BETTER.

15:16.516 --> 15:19.119
YOU'RE NOT GONNA SIT?
UM, I WAS GONNA,
BUT I-I REALLY NEED TO CRAM.

15:19.152 --> 15:21.121
I GOT
A REALLY BIG SURGERY TODAY.

15:21.154 --> 15:23.123
YOU KNOW, WE'RE OPERATING ON
THE KID WITH THE PENCIL,

15:23.156 --> 15:24.958
SO I'LL SEE YOU.
OKAY, SEE YOU AROUND.

15:24.992 --> 15:25.959
OKAY.

15:25.993 --> 15:26.893
OKAY.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.029
WILL SHE BE ABLE TO SIT
ON HER BUTT AGAIN?

15:29.062 --> 15:31.331
OR WILL SHE HAVE TO CARRY AROUND
ONE OF THOSE TOILET SEATS

15:31.364 --> 15:33.133
FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE?

15:33.166 --> 15:35.735
SHE'LL HAVE FULL USE
OF HER BUTT IN A FEW WEEKS.

15:35.768 --> 15:39.506
I AM SO, SO HONORED TO BE
FILLING IN FOR YOU AS CAPTAIN.

15:39.539 --> 15:42.275
YOU'RE FILLING IN FOR ME
AS CAPTAIN?

15:42.309 --> 15:45.378
I PRAYED ON IT, AND GOD SEEMS
TO THINK IT'S THE RIGHT MOVE.

15:45.412 --> 15:47.714
OH, OKAY.

15:47.747 --> 15:49.716
OH, AND I DON'T
WANT YOU TO WORRY.

15:49.749 --> 15:51.985
I CALLED RANDY, AND I THINK
I MIGHT HAVE CONVINCED HIM

15:52.019 --> 15:53.987
TO STILL
TAKE YOU TO HOMECOMING

15:54.021 --> 15:56.223
EVEN THOUGH YOUR FACE
AND YOUR BUTT'S ALL MESSED UP.

15:56.256 --> 15:58.291
I BET HE'LL TAKE YOU.
HE'S CLASSY THAT WAY.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.327
OKAY, SO NOW THAT
WE'VE ESTABLISHED

16:00.360 --> 16:03.163
THAT RANDY'S A CLASSY GUY,
VISITING TIME IS OVER.

16:03.196 --> 16:06.133
BYE, SWEETIE.
I HOPE THEY DON'T RUIN
YOUR FACE.

16:06.166 --> 16:08.168
GO!

16:08.201 --> 16:10.037
***

16:10.070 --> 16:12.172
KINDA SUCKS, HUH?

16:12.205 --> 16:15.075
(whimpers)
LITTLE MANICURED VULTURES.

16:15.108 --> 16:17.144
MY LIFE IS OVER.

16:17.177 --> 16:18.745
(sobs)

16:18.778 --> 16:21.448
(crying) MY LIFE IS OVER.

16:21.481 --> 16:24.517
MOM... I-I LOVE YOU, TOO.

16:24.551 --> 16:28.755
WILL--WILL YOU--
WILL YOU TELL DAD...

16:28.788 --> 16:30.157
HELLO?

16:30.190 --> 16:32.192
HELLO?

16:32.225 --> 16:35.162
***

16:35.195 --> 16:37.364
THANKS TO
YOUR PIECE-OF-CRAP PHONE,

16:37.397 --> 16:40.233
MY MOM'S GONNA THINK
I DIED.

16:40.267 --> 16:42.135
OH.

16:42.169 --> 16:43.770
THIS IS WHERE...

16:43.803 --> 16:46.539
YEAH. BUT WE'LL
KEEP YOU UPDATED.

16:46.573 --> 16:48.541

16:48.575 --> 16:50.210
HEY.

16:50.243 --> 16:52.212
***

16:52.245 --> 16:54.481
YOU BETTER NOT END UP BLIND

16:54.514 --> 16:56.483
AND GO TO
SOME BLIND KID'S SCHOOL,

16:56.516 --> 17:00.153
'CAUSE, UM,
IF I HAVE TO GO BACK

17:00.187 --> 17:04.124
TO JUNIOR YEAR WITHOUT YOU,
YOU'RE GONNA BE DEAD MEAT.

17:04.157 --> 17:05.325
(clears throat)

17:05.358 --> 17:06.826
***

17:06.859 --> 17:09.162
LATER, FREAK.

17:09.196 --> 17:11.198
YOU'RE THE FREAK.

17:11.231 --> 17:13.400
YOU ARE.

17:13.433 --> 17:15.135
YOU ARE.

17:15.168 --> 17:18.171
***

17:25.278 --> 17:29.082

17:33.353 --> 17:35.855
I PROMISED THIS KID LIFE
GETS BETTER AFTER HIGH SCHOOL.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.858
HE DESERVES TO SEE THAT.
HE'S GOT A GOOD FRIEND.
THAT'S SOMETHING.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.860
THAT GIRL HAS BEEN
BY HIS BEDSIDE ALL DAY.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.329
YEAH, BUT EVEN SO,

17:42.362 --> 17:44.097
THOSE CLIQUES,
THEY'RE MISERABLE.

17:44.131 --> 17:46.166
HE JUST NEEDS TO KNOW
IT PASSES EVENTUALLY.

17:46.199 --> 17:48.168
(woman laughs)

17:48.201 --> 17:50.470
SORRY, DR. SHEPHERD.

17:50.503 --> 17:53.240
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

17:54.374 --> 17:56.343
I'M JUST NOT SURE
WE'VE COME AS FAR

17:56.376 --> 17:58.345
AS YOU'D LIKE TO THINK,
CLIQUE-WISE.

17:58.378 --> 18:00.413
WE?

18:00.447 --> 18:02.549
THE HOSPITAL.
YOU THINK
THE HOSPITAL'S CLIQUE-Y?

18:02.582 --> 18:04.517
OH, DAMN IT.

18:04.551 --> 18:07.854
THE ARTERY'S BURST.
HIS BRAIN IS SWELLING.
IT'S CUTTING OFF BLOOD SUPPLY.

18:07.887 --> 18:10.523
OKAY, PUSH 80 GRAMS
OF MANNITOL. OKAY, LET'S GO.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.666
HOW DO I TELL HIS BEST FRIEND

18:19.699 --> 18:22.335
THAT HE'S GONNA BE IN A COMA
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE?

18:22.369 --> 18:24.537
YOU CAN'T TELL HER YET,
DEREK.

18:24.571 --> 18:26.673
THE FAMILY
HAS TO KNOW FIRST.

18:26.706 --> 18:28.275
DANNY'S DOCTOR.
OH, THANK GOD.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.277
IT'S ONLY BEEN A FEW HOURS
WITHOUT DANNY,

18:30.310 --> 18:31.878
AND I'M ALREADY
STARTING TO FREAK OUT.

18:31.911 --> 18:34.647
I MEAN, LOOK WHAT
I HAVE TO PUT UP WITH.

18:34.681 --> 18:36.649
THEY'RE CRYING--
LIKE, ACTUAL REAL TEARS--

18:36.683 --> 18:38.451
'CAUSE THEY'RE SO WORRIED
ABOUT DANNY,

18:38.485 --> 18:41.588
WHICH WOULD BE FINE
IF THEY KNEW WHO DANNY WAS.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.923
(sighs) WHATEVER.

18:43.956 --> 18:46.125
CAN I SEE HIM?

18:47.594 --> 18:49.929
HE HASN'T WOKEN UP YET.

18:49.962 --> 18:53.566
BUT HE'S OKAY?

18:53.600 --> 18:56.569
AS SOON AS I KNOW SOMETHING,
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

18:56.603 --> 18:59.306
OKAY.

19:07.414 --> 19:10.183
(Alex) YOU THINK SHE'LL RECOVER
FULL FUNCTION OF HER KNEE?

19:10.217 --> 19:12.585
I HOPE SO, 'CAUSE IF SHE DOESN'T
GET BACK ON THE POM-POM BRIGADE,

19:12.619 --> 19:14.587
HER LIFE IS TOTALLY OVER.

19:14.621 --> 19:17.457
MAN, YOU'D THINK THE WAY
THEY TREAT HER,

19:17.490 --> 19:20.460
SHE'D BE READY TO DITCH
THE WHOLE THING, BUT NO.
OF COURSE SHE'S NOT GONNA
WALK AWAY FROM THAT.

19:20.493 --> 19:21.394
IT'S HER LIFE.
IT'S HER IDENTITY.

19:21.428 --> 19:23.630
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
SHE UNDERSTANDS HERSELF

19:23.663 --> 19:25.965
IN THE WORLD.
MM-HMM. (chuckles)

19:25.998 --> 19:28.668
I HEARD ONE OF THE, UH,
SWEET YOUNG THINGS

19:28.701 --> 19:31.404
TOLD MARK HE LOOKED LIKE
HER DAD TODAY.
(laughs) HARSH.

19:31.438 --> 19:33.740
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH ANYTHING?
WELL, YOU JUST SEEM

19:33.773 --> 19:36.209
REALLY EMPATHETIC
TO HER PLIGHT, YOU KNOW?

19:36.243 --> 19:38.345
LOSS OF IDENTITY,
SHATTERED SELF-IMAGE.

19:38.378 --> 19:41.481
YOU SEEM PRETTY HAPPY
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO HER.
NO--

19:41.514 --> 19:42.715
SHE'S JUST HAPPY 'CAUSE

19:42.749 --> 19:45.252
STEVENS AND O'MALLEY
HIT THE SKIDS.

19:45.285 --> 19:48.255
(laughing) DIDN'T I TELL YOU
NOT TO TELL ANYBODY?

19:48.288 --> 19:50.590
(clears throat)

19:55.695 --> 19:57.397
I PULLED ALL THE X-RAYS

19:57.430 --> 19:58.665
FOR TOMORROW'S
SCHEDULED SURGERIES.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.768
AND WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THEM?

20:01.801 --> 20:03.970
OH, I THOUGHT I COULD
PUT THEM IN THE O.R.

20:04.003 --> 20:06.606
IF YOU NEEDED ME TO.
WELL, I DON'T.

20:10.277 --> 20:11.644
BACK OFF.

20:11.678 --> 20:13.280
WHAT?

20:13.313 --> 20:15.515
YOU'RE BEING
A BROWNNOSER.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.717
I'M HELPING HER.
NO, YOU'RE ANNOYING HER.

20:17.750 --> 20:20.320
YOU GOT A CHANCE TO SHOW HER
WHAT YOU CAN DO,

20:20.353 --> 20:21.788
AND NOW YOU'RE BLOWING IT.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.723
AND TRUST ME,
THESE KINDS OF CHANCES

20:23.756 --> 20:26.426
DO NOT
COME AROUND ALL THE TIME.

20:26.459 --> 20:28.428
SO, YOU KNOW,
JUST BACK OFF.

20:28.461 --> 20:30.997
(mouths words)

20:31.030 --> 20:32.999
I'M SORRY
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU

20:33.032 --> 20:35.435
WHEN YOU WERE
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

20:35.468 --> 20:39.672
I'VE REGRETTED IT EVERY DAY,
NOT KNOWING YOU.

20:39.706 --> 20:41.674
SOMETIMES I STILL WORRY
ABOUT YOU.

20:41.708 --> 20:44.010
THEN OTHER TIMES I THINK,
YOU KNOW,

20:44.043 --> 20:46.446
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT MADE YOU
SO STRONG.

20:46.479 --> 20:50.016
NOT AN EXCUSE. NOT AT ALL.
BUT YOU ARE SO STRONG.

20:50.049 --> 20:52.452
GOSH. YOU'RE STRONGER
THAN LEXIE.

20:52.485 --> 20:54.454
I DON'T KNOW HER
THAT WELL.

20:54.487 --> 20:57.624
WELL... TRUE.

20:59.859 --> 21:02.662
YOU'RE A VERY
IMPRESSIVE PERSON, MEREDITH.

21:02.695 --> 21:05.665
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

21:07.634 --> 21:10.370
I'M A LIFETIME...

21:10.403 --> 21:13.640
LIFETIME'S WORTH
OF PROUD.

21:13.673 --> 21:16.643
(laughs) ANYWAY...

21:18.511 --> 21:19.812
HEY.

21:19.846 --> 21:22.349
HOW WAS YOUR DATE
WITH SYDNEY?

21:22.382 --> 21:25.718
OH, I WAS WONDERING WHEN
YOU WERE GONNA BRING THAT UP.

21:29.088 --> 21:30.657
MY DAD'S IN THE E.R.

21:30.690 --> 21:31.791
REALLY?

21:31.824 --> 21:33.493
MM-HMM.
HE CUT HIMSELF.

21:33.526 --> 21:35.795
HE'S NOT BAD COMPANY,
ACTUALLY.

21:35.828 --> 21:38.698
HE'S QUITE FUNNY
AND CHARMING... DRUNK.

21:38.731 --> 21:42.502
IS IT WEIRD THAT I LIKE
MY DRUNK DAD

21:42.535 --> 21:44.504
BETTER THAN MY REGULAR DAD?

21:44.537 --> 21:46.105
A LITTLE.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.774
OH.

21:47.807 --> 21:50.610
(sighs)

21:50.643 --> 21:52.445
ARE YOU OKAY?

21:52.479 --> 21:54.447
YEAH. I, UM...

21:54.481 --> 21:56.449
BUT MY PATIENT'S
IN A COMA,

21:56.483 --> 21:59.352
AND HE'S NEVER GONNA
WAKE UP AGAIN.

21:59.386 --> 22:01.788
HIS BEST FRIEND
IS IN THE WAITING AREA.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.456
THE POOR THING
THINKS HE'S...

22:03.490 --> 22:07.360
SHE THINKS HE'S GONNA WAKE UP
ANY SECOND.

22:07.394 --> 22:09.629
I DON'T KNOW.

22:15.935 --> 22:18.137
(man) I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

22:18.170 --> 22:19.739
WHO TOLD YOU?

22:19.772 --> 22:21.741
HENRY. HE WAS OBSERVING
IN, UH, SLOAN'S SURGERY,

22:21.774 --> 22:24.644
AND HE SAID THAT SLOAN
ANNOUNCED IT TO THE WHOLE O.R.

22:24.677 --> 22:27.480
WOW.
O'MALLEY AND STEVENS ARE DONE.

22:27.514 --> 22:29.482
YEAH.
THEY DIDN'T EVEN LAST
A WEEK.

22:29.516 --> 22:30.883
I KNOW.

22:30.917 --> 22:32.885
CAN I HAVE THE KEY BACK
TO MY HOUSE?

22:32.919 --> 22:34.387
HEY. WHAT?

22:34.421 --> 22:36.389
THE KEY TO MY HOUSE,
I WANT IT BACK.

22:36.423 --> 22:38.157
I HEARD WE BROKE UP,
SO I WANT IT BACK.

22:38.190 --> 22:40.793
CAN I HAVE IT PLEASE?
UM, YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW
I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA

22:40.827 --> 22:42.061
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?
REALLY?

22:42.094 --> 22:45.164
APPARENTLY EVERYONE'S TALKING
ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE BROKE UP.

22:45.197 --> 22:47.834
WHO HAVE YOU BEEN TALKING TO,
GEORGE?
NOBODY.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.702
I MEAN, I TALKED TO MEREDITH.
SEE, I KNEW IT.

22:49.736 --> 22:52.705
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU KNEW IT?
YOU BEEN TALKING TO HER?

22:52.739 --> 22:54.774
YEAH, BUT ONLY AFTER
YOU WERE TALKING TO HER.

22:54.807 --> 22:57.910
SO, UH, I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO TALKED TO HER THEN.

22:57.944 --> 23:00.379
YOU TALKED TO HER FIRST.

23:14.827 --> 23:17.730
WHAT IS MY DAD DOING HERE?

23:17.764 --> 23:19.732
YOUR DAD CAME IN DRUNK
THIS MORNING.

23:19.766 --> 23:21.968
THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING
TO TELL YOU EARLIER

23:22.001 --> 23:23.736
WHEN YOU BLEW ME OFF.

23:23.770 --> 23:25.938
SO... SO YOU RUN
TO MEREDITH?

23:25.972 --> 23:28.841
THE ONE PERSON
THAT I ASKED YOU NOT TO TELL?

23:28.875 --> 23:31.478
I WAS TRYING TO HELP, OKAY?

23:31.511 --> 23:33.480
RIGHT.

23:36.583 --> 23:38.851
YOU KNOW,
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED.

23:38.885 --> 23:40.953
I MEAN, NOT EVEN ONE BIT.

23:40.987 --> 23:43.556
YOU GET THIS VERY INTENSE LOOK
ON YOUR FACE

23:43.590 --> 23:45.458
WHEN YOU'RE SERIOUS,
YOU KNOW?

23:45.492 --> 23:48.628
IT'S YOUR SERIOUS,
HOME-WORK-DOIN' FACE.

23:48.661 --> 23:50.630
HASN'T CHANGED. (laughs)

23:50.663 --> 23:52.865
DR. BAILEY,

23:52.899 --> 23:55.868
IS THAT A PATIENT FORM
I SEE IN YOUR HAND?

23:55.902 --> 23:58.638
YES, I SUPPOSE IT IS.

23:58.671 --> 24:01.541
PATIENTS ARE SUPPOSED TO
FILL OUT PATIENT FORMS.

24:01.574 --> 24:04.977
YOU HAVE WORK TO DO,
YOUR OWN WORK.
YES, SIR.

24:05.011 --> 24:06.979
(clears throat)
MANDI?

24:07.013 --> 24:09.248
MANDI?

24:09.281 --> 24:11.784
MANDI, I'M NOT...
I'M NOT FEELING SO...
MARCUS?

24:11.818 --> 24:13.753
MARCUS?
PULSE-OX IS DROPPING.

24:13.786 --> 24:16.989
PRESSURE IS 82 OVER 48.
TELL RADIOLOGY WE NEED
A STAT SPIRAL C.T.

24:17.023 --> 24:18.991
AND PAGE DR. HAHN.

24:19.025 --> 24:20.660
DR. SHEPHERD.

24:20.693 --> 24:21.961
MARISSA.

24:21.994 --> 24:24.797
I KNOW DANNY'S PARENTS
AREN'T GONNA BE HERE

24:24.831 --> 24:28.835
FOR A COUPLE MORE HOURS,
BUT COULD I AT LEAST SEE HIM?

24:28.868 --> 24:30.236
PLEASE.

24:30.269 --> 24:32.839
(sighs) ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

24:32.872 --> 24:34.607
LET'S--LET'S GO SIT DOWN.

24:39.278 --> 24:41.981
MM.

24:48.054 --> 24:50.022
SEE, THE, UH...

24:54.326 --> 24:56.062
WHEN I REMOVED THE PENCIL,

24:56.095 --> 25:00.066
THE ARTERY BURST.

25:00.099 --> 25:02.068
WHEN THE BRAIN SWELLS
THAT MUCH,

25:02.101 --> 25:04.871
IT HAS NOWHERE TO GO.

25:07.607 --> 25:08.975
THE HEMOR--

25:09.008 --> 25:12.579
(crying)

25:17.083 --> 25:20.920
(crying continues)

25:31.030 --> 25:32.565
HEY.

25:32.599 --> 25:34.300
I AM GETTING
TWO CUPS OF COFFEE--

25:34.333 --> 25:37.003
TWO--ONE FOR ME,
ONE FOR MY DAD.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.971
HE'S HERE.

25:39.005 --> 25:41.841
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

25:41.874 --> 25:43.910
AT THIS EXACT MOMENT

25:43.943 --> 25:45.311
IN O.R. TWO,

25:45.344 --> 25:49.015
DR. HAHN IS PERFORMING
A PULMONARY EMBOLECTOMY.

25:49.048 --> 25:51.017
A PULMONARY EMBOLECTOMY,
MEREDITH.

25:51.050 --> 25:52.318
SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
YOU'RE ON HER SERVICE. JUST GO.

25:52.351 --> 25:54.754
NO, I CAN'T BECAUSE THAT
WILL MAKE ME A BROWNNOSER,

25:54.787 --> 25:57.089
AND EVERYBODY HATES
BROWNNOSERS.

25:57.123 --> 25:59.592
I CANNOT BE A BROWNNOSER.

25:59.626 --> 26:02.094
OKAY. SO...

26:02.128 --> 26:05.131
THERE'LL BE OTHER EMBOLECTOMIES.
YOU CAN LET THIS ONE SLIDE?

26:05.164 --> 26:07.366
NO, NO, NO. NO, I CAN'T!

26:07.399 --> 26:10.369
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO JUST LET
A PULMONARY EMBOLECTOMY SLIDE.

26:10.402 --> 26:13.640
SURE YOU CAN. IT'S JUST LIKE
CUTTING A CLASS.

26:15.407 --> 26:17.009
YOU NEVER CUT A CLASS.

26:17.043 --> 26:18.911
NEVER, NOT ONCE.

26:18.945 --> 26:21.013
HUH.

26:23.716 --> 26:26.986
THAT WAS A PRETTY BIG V.S.D.
ON THE ECHO.

26:27.019 --> 26:29.355
I'M GONNA HAVE TO DO
AN ADDITIONAL ARTERIOTOMY

26:29.388 --> 26:30.957
OF THE RIGHT P.A.

26:30.990 --> 26:32.959
YOU SHOULD'VE TAKEN
THE SITUATION SERIOUSLY.

26:32.992 --> 26:34.961
YOU SHOULD'VE ORDERED
FURTHER TESTS.

26:34.994 --> 26:37.730
MAYBE I SHOULD'VE.
OR MAYBE YOU SHOULD'VE.

26:37.764 --> 26:40.399
AND IF YOU WEREN'T SO BUSY
FLIRTING WITH THE PATIENT

26:40.432 --> 26:42.034
LIKE A LOVE-STRUCK TEENAGER,

26:42.068 --> 26:44.103
MAYBE YOU WOULD HAVE.

26:44.136 --> 26:46.605
FORCEPS, PLEASE.

26:48.675 --> 26:49.809
THIS IS SO SAD.

26:49.842 --> 26:51.811
I USED TO WALK BY HIS HOUSE
EVERY DAY.

26:51.844 --> 26:55.181
HE WAS IN MY ALGEBRA CLASS,
I THINK.

26:57.416 --> 27:00.787
MARISSA...

27:00.820 --> 27:04.190
I KNOW THAT THIS SEEMS
IMPOSSIBLE RIGHT NOW,

27:04.223 --> 27:06.192
BUT YOU WILL GET THROUGH THIS.

27:06.225 --> 27:08.060
DANNY WOULD'VE WANTED YOU TO.

27:08.094 --> 27:10.062
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE WOULD'VE WANTED.

27:10.096 --> 27:12.064
YOU'RE JUST LIKE THEM.

27:12.098 --> 27:14.100
YOU'RE A PROM QUEEN,
AND YOU'RE TRYING TO ACT LIKE

27:14.133 --> 27:16.202
YOU KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE FOR ME.

27:16.235 --> 27:18.705
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT IT'S LIKE.

27:20.439 --> 27:23.209
I WASN'T A PROM QUEEN.

27:25.244 --> 27:27.213
I WAS THE GIRL
IN THE CHEAP CLOTHES

27:27.246 --> 27:30.082
FROM THE TRAILER PARK
WHO GOT PREGNANT

27:30.116 --> 27:33.419
AND GOT THROWN
IN THE PREGNANT GIRLS' CLASS.

27:33.452 --> 27:36.856
NONE OF THE MOTHERS WOULD LET
THEIR KIDS HANG OUT WITH ME.

27:36.889 --> 27:39.692
BUT I GOT THROUGH IT.

27:39.726 --> 27:42.161
YOU WILL GET THROUGH THIS.

27:42.194 --> 27:45.698
I'M GONNA WRITE A LETTER
TO HIS MOM AND DAD.

27:45.732 --> 27:48.100
THAT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL.
GET OUT.

27:48.134 --> 27:50.803
WHAT?
GET OUT. YOU'RE NOT EVEN
SUPPOSED TO BE IN HERE.

27:50.837 --> 27:54.106
SHE'S HERE.
SHE'S HIS FRIEND,
HIS BEST FRIEND.

27:54.140 --> 27:56.042
GO AWAY.

27:56.075 --> 27:58.010
GO.

27:58.044 --> 28:00.446
***

28:00.479 --> 28:03.049
I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN TO--

28:03.082 --> 28:04.450
IT'S OKAY.

28:04.483 --> 28:06.886
YOU JUST LOST
YOUR BEST FRIEND.

28:06.919 --> 28:10.056
IT'S--IT'S THE WORST THING
IN THE WORLD.

28:10.089 --> 28:12.091
***

28:12.124 --> 28:13.492
OH, DR. SHEPHERD.

28:13.525 --> 28:14.827
YES.

28:14.861 --> 28:16.462
I'M SORRY...

28:16.495 --> 28:18.064
A-ABOUT DANNY METCALF.

28:18.097 --> 28:20.099
IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS HARD
ON YOU, WHICH IS GOOD.

28:20.132 --> 28:22.101
IF I HAD A SON
GOING THROUGH THAT,

28:22.134 --> 28:25.738
I'D WANT THE SURGEON TO BE
FULLY INVESTED LIKE YOU WERE.

28:25.772 --> 28:28.074
***

28:28.107 --> 28:30.242
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHO I AM, DO YOU?

28:30.276 --> 28:31.978
OF COURSE I DO. (chuckles)

28:32.011 --> 28:35.514
BYE, DR. SHEPHERD.

28:35.547 --> 28:37.850
YOU'RE THE NURSE IN O.R. TWO?

28:37.884 --> 28:40.252
THE ONE
THAT TALKED ABOUT CLIQUES?

28:40.286 --> 28:42.121
YEAH. RIGHT?

28:42.154 --> 28:46.092
***

28:46.125 --> 28:48.494
I AM NEVER
GONNA BE CAPTAIN AGAIN.

28:48.527 --> 28:50.196
YOU KNOW, I WAS--

28:50.229 --> 28:52.264
I WAS FIRED
FROM A JOB RECENTLY--

28:52.298 --> 28:54.266
YOU WERE FIRED
FROM BEING A DOCTOR,

28:54.300 --> 28:56.769
AND THEY LET YOU
CUT OPEN MY ASS?

28:56.803 --> 28:59.171
OKAY, SHUT YOUR TRAP FOR
EIGHT SECONDS AND LET ME FINISH.

28:59.205 --> 29:02.174
(sighs) I DIDN'T GET FIRED
FROM BEING A DOCTOR.

29:02.208 --> 29:04.176
I GOT FIRED FROM BEING,

29:04.210 --> 29:08.547
LIKE, WELL,
OUR VERSION OF SQUAD CAPTAIN,

29:08.580 --> 29:12.518
WHICH IS MOSTLY
ABOUT ORGANIZING CRAP...

29:12.551 --> 29:14.954
NOT ABOUT SURGERY.

29:14.987 --> 29:17.156
SO?

29:17.189 --> 29:21.060
SO... I GOT TO GO BACK
TO THE PART THAT I LIKE,

29:21.093 --> 29:23.529
WHICH...

29:23.562 --> 29:26.165
IT'S KIND OF A GIFT.

29:59.031 --> 30:01.333
UH, YOU PAGED, DR. HAHN?

30:01.367 --> 30:03.269
APPARENTLY
WHEN YOU ASK FOR COPIES

30:03.302 --> 30:06.238
OF THE C.T. ANGIO AROUND HERE,

30:06.272 --> 30:09.842
PEOPLE THINK IT'S ALL RIGHT
TO JUST GIVE YOU THE SLICES

30:09.876 --> 30:11.243
THAT CONTAIN THE CLOT.

30:11.277 --> 30:13.846
CAN YOU PLEASE BRING ME
THE ENTIRE C.T.?

30:13.880 --> 30:16.348
ABSOLUTELY, YES. ABSOLUTELY.
I'LL DO THAT RIGHT NOW.

30:16.382 --> 30:20.319
***

30:25.624 --> 30:27.593
YOUR DAD
WAS IN THE E.R. TODAY.

30:27.626 --> 30:29.862
I KNOW.
SO YOU KNOW HE WAS DRUNK

30:29.896 --> 30:32.064
AND HE PUT HIS HAND
THROUGH A WINDOW.

30:32.098 --> 30:33.632
YEAH. ANYTHING ELSE?

30:33.665 --> 30:36.002
I KNOW
IT WAS SUSAN'S BIRTHDAY,

30:36.035 --> 30:37.369
AND I'M SURE

30:37.403 --> 30:39.939
IT WAS A VERY HARD DAY
FOR THE BOTH OF YOU.

30:39.972 --> 30:41.941
AND HE WASN'T ACTUALLY
A PROBLEM.

30:41.974 --> 30:43.375
HE WAS KIND OF CHARMING.

30:43.409 --> 30:45.945
BUT... HE SEEMED VERY SAD,

30:45.978 --> 30:48.380
AND I'D HATE
TO SEE IT HAPPEN AGAIN.

30:48.414 --> 30:50.382
SO MAYBE YOU
SHOULD THINK ABOUT

30:50.416 --> 30:52.451
KEEPING A BETTER EYE ON HIM.

30:57.423 --> 30:59.926
EVERY DAY
IS MY MOTHER'S BIRTHDAY.

31:01.961 --> 31:07.199
MY MOTHER WAS BORN IN MARCH.
HE LIED. HE'S A LIAR.

31:07.233 --> 31:09.068
AND I'M GLAD,

31:09.101 --> 31:11.070
REALLY, I'M GLAD
THAT YOU FOUND HIM CHARMING.

31:11.103 --> 31:12.905
I'M SURE HE WAS DELIGHTFUL.

31:12.939 --> 31:14.941
HE'S A BLAST
AFTER FIVE DRINKS.

31:14.974 --> 31:18.177
NOT SO MUCH AFTER NINE, THOUGH.
HE GETS A LITTLE WEEPY AND MEAN.

31:18.210 --> 31:19.946
HE'S A DRUNK, MEREDITH.

31:19.979 --> 31:23.382
HE PROBABLY CAME IN AND TOLD YOU
HOW WONDERFUL YOU ARE,

31:23.415 --> 31:26.452
HOW SAD HE IS THAT HE DOESN'T
GET TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH YOU.

31:26.485 --> 31:29.922
YESTERDAY HE SAID THAT
I WAS HIS FAVORITE DAUGHTER.

31:29.956 --> 31:33.192
THE DAY BEFORE,
I WAS AN UNGRATEFUL BITCH.

31:33.225 --> 31:36.195
THE WEEK BEFORE, HE WROTE ME
A CHECK FOR $20,000

31:36.228 --> 31:39.265
BECAUSE HE SAID I DESERVED
EVERYTHING LIFE HAD TO OFFER

31:39.298 --> 31:43.269
BECAUSE HE WAS SO PROUD OF ME,
A LIFETIME'S WORTH OF PROUD.

31:43.302 --> 31:46.973
SO THANK YOU
FOR LETTING ME KNOW

31:47.006 --> 31:49.942
THAT I NEED TO KEEP
A BETTER EYE ON HIM.

31:49.976 --> 31:52.144
THANKS.

31:54.713 --> 31:58.050
(Meredith exhales deeply)

32:01.520 --> 32:04.256
MEREDITH, YOU WANT TO
COME IN FOR A MINUTE

32:04.290 --> 32:05.491
AND SIT DOWN?

32:05.524 --> 32:08.961
(breathing rapidly)

32:08.995 --> 32:10.963
MEREDITH?

32:10.997 --> 32:14.000
(rapid breathing continues)

32:24.743 --> 32:26.278
(sighs)

32:26.312 --> 32:28.981
I'M SORRY ABOUT ALL THIS.

32:29.015 --> 32:30.983
MEREDITH, PLEASE. YOU HAVE
NOTHING TO APOLOGIZE FOR,

32:31.017 --> 32:32.384
NOTHING AT ALL.

32:32.418 --> 32:34.386
I'M KEEPING YOU
FROM DOING YOUR JOB.

32:34.420 --> 32:37.056
THIS IS MY JOB,
AT LEAST PART OF IT.

32:37.089 --> 32:39.992
THINK OF IT AS...
THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE,

32:40.026 --> 32:43.262
ONLY I'M THE NICE PRINCIPAL.

32:43.295 --> 32:46.065
ANYWAY, I PROMISED YOUR MOM
I'D TAKE CARE OF YOU.

32:46.098 --> 32:49.001
I TOLD YOU,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

32:49.035 --> 32:52.004

34:04.176 --> 34:07.146
I THINK A LOT OF IT

NO, YOU DON'T.
I'M JUST GONNA SAY ONE THING.

38:04.816 --> 38:07.419
IN HIGH SCHOOL,
I WAS 110 POUNDS,

38:07.453 --> 38:10.422
AND I HADN'T YET
FIGURED OUT HAIR PRODUCT,

38:10.456 --> 38:12.824
SO I HAD A BIG AFRO,

38:12.858 --> 38:16.662

38:16.695 --> 38:20.532

WORE A BAND UNIFORM.

38:22.534 --> 38:25.337
SAX.

OBOE.

(sniffles)

38:32.411 --> 38:35.347
(sighs)

38:37.516 --> 38:39.885
AND I
WOULD'VE BEEN HONORED...

38:39.918 --> 38:43.622
TO TAKE A GIRL LIKE YOU
TO HOMECOMING.

38:45.424 --> 38:49.094
IN SOME WAYS WE GROW UP.

38:49.127 --> 38:51.096
WE HAVE FAMILIES.

38:51.129 --> 38:53.365
WE GET MARRIED...

38:55.867 --> 38:58.103
DIVORCED.

38:58.136 --> 39:01.707

OF A LONG SPEECH...

39:01.740 --> 39:04.109
YOU KNOW, LIKE BAILEY
WITH THE LONG SPEECHES.

39:04.142 --> 39:06.144

39:06.177 --> 39:08.547
JUST, EVERYTHING
I WANTED TO SAY TO...

39:08.580 --> 39:11.583
IT...

39:11.617 --> 39:13.585
IT JUST IS,
I CAN'T TALK TO YOU.

39:13.619 --> 39:15.454
I--THAT'S WHY I TALKED
TO MEREDITH.

39:15.487 --> 39:17.523
I JUST--
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

39:19.791 --> 39:22.394
IT USED TO BE...

39:24.162 --> 39:27.699
IT USED TO BE...

39:27.733 --> 39:30.702
THAT I WAS THE ONLY PERSON
YOU COULD TALK TO,

39:30.736 --> 39:33.705
AND YOU WERE THE ONLY PERSON
I COULD TALK TO.

39:33.739 --> 39:35.574
I KNOW.

WHAT TO SAY TO ME ABOUT IT.

39:44.883 --> 39:47.853
I NEED TO BE ABLE TO TALK
TO MY BEST FRIEND.

39:47.886 --> 39:50.422

WITHOUT MY BEST FRIEND.

39:50.456 --> 39:53.425
WHY ISN'T THIS EASIER?

39:53.459 --> 39:55.594
I DON'T KNOW.

MY BEST FRIEND BACK.

41:45.704 --> 41:49.808
WELL, I WON'T LET THIS AFFECT
OUR WORK IF YOU WON'T.

41:49.841 --> 41:51.543
I WON'T.

41:51.577 --> 41:54.546
***

41:57.916 --> 42:01.720
NO MATTER HOW MUCH
WE GROW TALLER...

42:01.753 --> 42:05.691
***

42:05.724 --> 42:07.559
GROW OLDER...

42:07.593 --> 42:10.028
APPARENTLY I'M NOT GOOD
AT MEETING NEEDS.

42:10.061 --> 42:13.765
AND I DON'T BRING
THAT MUCH TO THE TABLE.

42:13.799 --> 42:16.301
I'M AWKWARD AND FREAKY.

42:16.334 --> 42:17.736
MM.

42:17.769 --> 42:20.305
WE ARE STILL
FOREVER STUMBLING...

42:20.338 --> 42:22.908
DO YOU WANT
TO GET OUT OF HERE?
I DO.

42:22.941 --> 42:25.944
***

42:29.080 --> 42:31.750
FOREVER WONDERING...

42:31.783 --> 42:33.118
***

42:33.151 --> 42:34.786
FOREVER...

42:34.820 --> 42:36.788
***

42:36.822 --> 42:38.824
YOUNG.
