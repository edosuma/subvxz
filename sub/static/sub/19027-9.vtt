<i>[J.D.] As for me,</i>
<i>all I lost was my pride.</i>

12:27.146 --> 12:31.913
Hey, Elliot. Oh, J.D.?
I'm glad I found you too.

12:33.385 --> 12:35.148
Well, that sounds familiar.

12:35.221 --> 12:38.088
- [Julie shouting]
- [Crashing]

12:39.525 --> 12:41.789
I think there's a tchotchke in my bum.

12:41.861 --> 12:43.624
[Gasping]

12:46.332 --> 12:48.857
<i>[J.D.] So I had</i>
<i>to use Elliot's advice with Julie.</i>

12:48.934 --> 12:50.902
<i>Luckily, she's not great at gloating.</i>

12:50.970 --> 12:53.871
Ha-ha, you had sex with
a beautiful girl you really like.

12:53.939 --> 12:55.804
<i>Sometimes she needs a little help.</i>

12:55.875 --> 12:59.811
You probably meant to say if it weren't
for you, I'd still be dating my laptop.

12:59.879 --> 13:02.814
Right! In your face! [laughs]

13:02.882 --> 13:04.213
[Whispers] Thank you.

13:04.283 --> 13:07.150
I like Julie,
so don't do that thing you always do.

13:07.219 --> 13:10.279
If you're referring
to the game Find the Saltine, relax.

13:10.356 --> 13:12.119
I don't even play that with Turk.

13:12.191 --> 13:15.160
No, I am talking about
how you go a million miles an hour

13:15.227 --> 13:18.492
the minute you fall for someone.
Don't go quickly or like I said,

13:18.564 --> 13:20.589
you'll end up with a beautiful girl.

13:20.666 --> 13:24.534
- Dating my laptop.
- Dating your laptop. Thank you.

13:28.107 --> 13:30.007
I knew he'd be trouble.

13:30.075 --> 13:32.202
Hey, come on now.
We're still a band, huh?

13:32.278 --> 13:34.769
Let's bring it in. Cool cats on three.

13:34.847 --> 13:37.577
- One, two, three:
- [All] Cool cats!

13:37.650 --> 13:39.015
Let's roll.

13:40.219 --> 13:43.780
When Mrs. Wilk was allergic to
melphalan, you found a way around it.

13:43.856 --> 13:45.915
Why aren't you doing the same?

13:45.991 --> 13:49.324
Because Mrs. Wilk didn't choose
to have her allergy, so...

13:49.395 --> 13:52.853
Wait, there's a young man behind you
with a quick medical question.

13:52.932 --> 13:54.957
[Jordan] Will you kiss me?

13:56.969 --> 13:58.436
Leaving.

13:58.504 --> 14:01.530
You know, you're eventually
gonna have to kiss your boy.

14:01.607 --> 14:04.167
And you will have
to treat that Jehovah's Witness.

14:04.243 --> 14:06.404
God, elevator.

14:08.113 --> 14:12.345
He's got my back, even if
I don't technically believe in him.

14:14.920 --> 14:16.285
Behind your ear.

14:16.388 --> 14:18.754
My friend, you have found the Saltine.

14:20.159 --> 14:22.218
Don't tell Elliot
we're still playing.

14:22.294 --> 14:26.060
<i>[J.D.] Why do I care what Elliot thinks?</i>
<i>She's not right about everything.</i>

14:26.165 --> 14:28.133
<i>I'm not gonna go too fast with Julie.</i>

14:29.034 --> 14:32.162
[# Fountains of Wayne: <i>Hey Julie]</i>

15:38.170 --> 15:40.536
<i>[J.D.] Ooh, land for sale.</i>

15:44.410 --> 15:47.243
Dr. Kelso, I'll go to that conference.

15:47.313 --> 15:49.679
Turkelton,
I have many more pressing issues,

15:49.782 --> 15:51.943
starting with a gigantic paralyzed wife,

15:52.017 --> 15:55.180
ending with a gay son who's
written a scathing musical about me

15:55.287 --> 15:59.223
called <i>Dr. Dad,</i> which, despite mixed
reviews, has been held over in Buffalo.

15:59.291 --> 16:01.987
Why don't you just do
whatever the hell you want to do.

16:02.061 --> 16:05.121
It was never
about you saying no to the conference.

16:05.197 --> 16:06.664
It's the way you said it.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.764
You see that man there?
His biggest pet peeve,

16:10.836 --> 16:13.361
except for storing deer meat
in his mini-fridge,

16:13.439 --> 16:15.964
is people being disrespectful to him.

16:20.279 --> 16:21.803
Do you play?

16:27.820 --> 16:31.586
- Lonnie, what are you doing?
- Since Dr. Cox won't treat Mrs. London,

16:31.690 --> 16:34.454
we have to transfer her
to another facility.

16:37.429 --> 16:41.525
All right, listen up and listen good.
I will kill anyone who tells Carla.

16:41.600 --> 16:44.364
That includes you, Mrs. London.
I will save your life.

16:44.470 --> 16:47.166
Then I will take it away.
Let's get to work.

16:48.774 --> 16:52.335
Lonnie... are you looking at me again?

16:52.444 --> 16:54.605
No.

16:59.351 --> 17:01.842
Are we crazy to be thinking
about buying this?

17:01.920 --> 17:05.549
No, it's a sound investment.
And a great addition to my portfolio.

17:05.624 --> 17:08.593
<i>[J.D.] Which consists of shares</i>
<i>of Eastern Airlines stock</i>

17:08.694 --> 17:11.424
<i>and an unopened pack</i>
<i>of</i> Les Mis <i>trading cards.</i>

17:11.497 --> 17:13.521
J.D., this is a mistake.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.926
You're not Broker of the Year
Whit Prowdy.

17:18.002 --> 17:20.528
Don't do this. You're going too fast.

17:20.606 --> 17:25.669
- Why should I believe you?
- Because honesty is my business.

17:27.546 --> 17:30.106
I hate you, Whit Prowdy.

17:32.451 --> 17:34.351
Sir, can I talk to you for a second?

17:34.420 --> 17:37.912
Just you? Or all the Turkeltones?

17:39.525 --> 17:43.359
We don't just rock together.
We roll together.

17:43.429 --> 17:44.589
[All] Cool cats.

17:45.898 --> 17:49.061
Sir, I want to apologize
for how I spoke to you.

17:49.168 --> 17:50.931
It was extremely disrespectful,

17:51.003 --> 17:53.563
and I can promise you
it will never happen again.

17:53.672 --> 17:56.197
You bet your ass it won't.

17:59.478 --> 18:01.844
OK. So what's the deal, cranky pants?

18:01.947 --> 18:06.611
I am just sick and tired of having
to live up to everyone's expectations.

18:06.685 --> 18:10.052
Lonnie needs a central line,
you want me to help Mrs. London

18:10.155 --> 18:12.453
and every patient in this dump

18:12.524 --> 18:15.084
looks at me for some miracle cure.

18:15.160 --> 18:19.028
I mean, honestly, Carla,
with Jehovah as my witness,

18:19.098 --> 18:21.191
sometimes it is just too much.

18:21.266 --> 18:23.598
Yeah, yeah. I'm not buying it.

18:23.669 --> 18:26.638
You've been putting up with that
around here for 20 years.

18:26.705 --> 18:28.263
It's not just here. It's home.

18:28.373 --> 18:32.332
Jordan expects me
to be this amazing, sensitive father.

18:32.444 --> 18:34.810
So that's what this is about?

18:34.880 --> 18:38.611
You shouldn't sweat this
"sensitive dad" stuff. You'll get there.

18:38.684 --> 18:40.379
You don't know anything.

18:40.452 --> 18:44.718
Oh, really? How is it going
with your Jehovah's Witness patient?

18:44.790 --> 18:46.849
Better.

18:47.459 --> 18:49.757
How'd you know I'd move
too fast with Julie?

18:49.828 --> 18:52.353
How do you know
that I can be that kind of dad?

18:52.431 --> 18:54.991
How'd you know Kelso
just wanted respect?

18:55.067 --> 18:57.365
<i>- Because I know you.</i>
<i>- Because I know you.</i>

18:57.436 --> 18:59.165
<i>'Cause I know him.</i>

18:59.238 --> 19:00.398
This is so cool.

19:00.506 --> 19:04.067
What's happening?
Dr. Cox didn't make eye holes!

19:04.143 --> 19:07.112
<i>[J.D.] It's important we listen</i>
<i>to people who know us best,</i>

19:07.212 --> 19:11.478
<i>because if you do,</i>
<i>you might get to rock.</i>

19:11.550 --> 19:13.814
[# Boston: <i>More Than a Feelin']</i>

19:45.250 --> 19:48.617
<i>[J.D.] You might get the confidence</i>
<i>to be the father you want to be.</i>

19:48.720 --> 19:50.585
Gimme this little boy.

19:52.124 --> 19:54.354
- [Mumbling]
- [Laughing]

19:54.426 --> 19:58.453
I love ya. I love you so much,
I'm going to make a sandwich out of you.

19:58.530 --> 20:02.227
- Where you going?
- "Dad's gonna devour me. See you."

20:02.301 --> 20:06.397
<i>[J.D.] Sometimes, it's fun to not listen</i>
<i>and do whatever you want.</i>

20:06.471 --> 20:08.496
So we bought it.

20:08.574 --> 20:13.204
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going
to go kiss my lady on my new half-acre.

20:13.278 --> 20:15.337
