20:14.145 --> 20:17.347
Another mystery?

20:17.414 --> 20:18.882
Wess, what can
we do about it?

20:26.123 --> 20:28.992
I checked the temperature.
Second lavic stage.

20:29.059 --> 20:30.560
I'm not interested
in the temperature.

20:30.628 --> 20:32.729
Can we get
across it or not?

20:32.797 --> 20:35.465
Well, it's pretty
dangerous down there.

20:35.533 --> 20:38.702
The rocks appear to be fused
and they're solid enough.

20:38.770 --> 20:41.237
If they continue
across the marsh,

20:41.305 --> 20:46.109
and if we're lucky...

20:46.176 --> 20:47.143
Let's try it.

22:45.313 --> 22:46.479
Clear.

23:24.635 --> 23:30.207
It's obvious.
They fought.

23:30.274 --> 23:33.910
They fought and
killed each other off.

23:33.978 --> 23:39.349
Just as we were
about to do.

23:39.416 --> 23:42.518
None of this... this madness
that has touched some of us,

23:42.586 --> 23:43.820
none of this
is coincidence.

23:43.888 --> 23:47.490
This was planned.

23:47.558 --> 23:49.592
By whom?
By what?

23:49.660 --> 23:52.562
And what about
the others?

23:52.630 --> 23:54.131
We can look
for them.

24:45.967 --> 24:48.769
Poor Toby, on
his first trip...

24:48.836 --> 24:51.805
The chamber's locked
from the inside.

24:51.873 --> 24:54.074
We'll need a torch
to break through.

24:54.142 --> 24:56.476
I counted 4, what
about the others?

24:56.543 --> 24:57.911
They don't seem
to be inside.

24:57.979 --> 25:04.317
Let's take a
look around.

25:04.385 --> 25:06.452
WESS: There isn't anybody
in the upper chambers.

25:06.520 --> 25:08.121
MARK: And what about
the control room?

25:08.189 --> 25:09.489
It's empty.

25:09.557 --> 25:12.225
Look in the dome's
secondary corridors.

25:12.293 --> 25:13.426
All right.

25:13.494 --> 25:14.878
In the meantime,
we'll look in the sections

25:14.945 --> 25:16.263
of the automatic circuits.

25:16.330 --> 25:17.847
Now, in case of
any emergency,

25:17.915 --> 25:24.938
we meet in the atomic
generator room.

MARK:
Find anything?

25:33.830 --> 25:36.082
WESS: No. The energy
section is deserted.

25:36.149 --> 25:37.366
Let's continue.

25:37.434 --> 25:41.037
The 3 that are missing can't
disappear into thin air.

25:53.634 --> 25:55.602
(SQUEAKING)

25:55.669 --> 25:58.204
It's coming from
the generator room.

26:15.589 --> 26:16.823
Turrell.

26:21.929 --> 26:24.997
And Salas,
mark?

26:25.065 --> 26:27.967
The meteor rejector
is out of commission.

26:28.035 --> 26:30.770
It can't be
repaired, either.

26:30.838 --> 26:35.208
The Galliot
won't fly again.

26:35.275 --> 26:37.143
Neither will
her crew.

26:44.084 --> 26:49.656
(SQUEAKING)

26:49.724 --> 26:52.559
What about this bulkhead?
We've got to get through.

26:52.626 --> 26:53.793
I'll take care
of it, mark.

26:53.861 --> 26:55.729
I'll get the cutting
torch from the Argos.

26:55.796 --> 26:58.331
No, you'd never
make it alone.

26:58.399 --> 27:00.500
No. We'll bury Derek
and the others

27:00.568 --> 27:02.902
and then we'll leave
you on guard, Eldon.

27:02.970 --> 27:04.237
We'll go for the
cutting torch

27:04.304 --> 27:07.574
and I promise you, we'll get
back just as fast as we can.

but don't go to pieces now.

27:33.851 --> 27:36.652
Just be thankful
we were spared.

27:36.720 --> 27:39.422
Come on. We've got
to keep moving.

27:39.490 --> 27:41.824
We'll get back as fast
as we can, Eldon.

Eldon?

30:05.619 --> 30:07.453
Eldon!

30:07.521 --> 30:09.688
Maybe he's inside the ship.
Tiona, you stay here.

There's no one here.

30:41.555 --> 30:43.189
WESS: But we left
4 bodies here.

30:43.256 --> 30:44.924
How could they
have disappeared?

30:55.803 --> 30:58.004
Eldon?

30:58.072 --> 30:59.238
Eldon!

30:59.306 --> 31:00.707
Kir! Salas!

31:07.180 --> 31:08.214
Where are they?

31:08.281 --> 31:11.150
They're gone.
All of them.

31:11.218 --> 31:14.153
Eldon, too. I left
him on guard.

31:14.221 --> 31:16.823
Listen, mark,
maybe you imagined it.

31:16.890 --> 31:18.390
Maybe the bodies
really weren't in here,

31:18.458 --> 31:20.359
you just thought you
saw them. Hallucination.

31:20.427 --> 31:22.461
I don't suffer from
hallucinations, Karan.

31:22.529 --> 31:23.863
I saw the bodies.

31:23.931 --> 31:26.899
Maybe our senses react in
a strange way on this planet.

31:26.967 --> 31:29.468
I saw the bodies.
I saw my brother, dead.

31:29.536 --> 31:31.104
What happened
to Eldon, then?

31:31.171 --> 31:33.740
He wasn't a ghost,
a hallucination.

31:33.807 --> 31:34.841
Let's take it easy.

31:34.908 --> 31:36.743
There must be some
logical explanation.

That's right, Mark.

Mark.

31:38.912 --> 31:41.781
What is it, Wess?

31:41.849 --> 31:44.450
We weren't
dreaming.

31:44.518 --> 31:46.252
Those bodies
really existed.

34:18.672 --> 34:20.239
completely
unexplainable.

34:20.306 --> 34:22.507
For 2 years, we heard
the electronic signals

34:22.574 --> 34:24.342
coming from
this planet.

34:24.411 --> 34:26.512
Now that we're
here, nothing.

34:26.579 --> 34:29.681
Yes, but we did hear voices.
A strange tongue, but voices.

34:29.748 --> 34:31.550
There were intelligent
beings here.

34:31.618 --> 34:34.520
You could've fooled me.
I never felt so all alone.

34:34.587 --> 34:36.621
Maybe we're
not alone.

34:36.690 --> 34:38.291
Somebody
or something

34:38.358 --> 34:40.326
could be watching
us here, right now.

34:40.393 --> 34:43.529
If there are any intelligent
creatures on this planet,

34:43.596 --> 34:45.031
they're our enemies.

34:45.098 --> 34:48.000
Wess, you've been taking
sightings and adding figures,

34:48.068 --> 34:48.835
what does it
come out to?

34:48.902 --> 34:49.902
How long can
we stay here?

34:49.969 --> 34:51.137
3 days,
mark.

34:51.205 --> 34:53.005
Another 3 days before
this planet's orbit

34:53.072 --> 34:54.841
will have swept
us so far away,

34:54.908 --> 34:56.675
we may not get
back home at all.

34:56.743 --> 34:57.844
What do
you think?

34:57.911 --> 34:59.946
Can you boost the solar
batteries by then?

35:00.013 --> 35:02.248
I'm trying to hook up some
other way of starting us.

35:02.316 --> 35:04.116
What are our
chances?

35:04.184 --> 35:06.418
We have 3 chances
in 10 to make it,

35:06.486 --> 35:08.087
or be blown
to smithereens.

35:08.155 --> 35:10.422
All right, Wess, tomorrow
morning, you get to work.

35:10.490 --> 35:11.790

need to help you.

35:11.859 --> 35:13.860
Right now, I think we
should all get some sleep.

And I confess now,
to whoever may hear this,

35:33.196 --> 35:35.748
that today, now,

35:35.815 --> 35:43.522
I am experiencing fear.

35:43.590 --> 35:45.574
I must not let my
crew know this,

35:45.642 --> 35:47.677
I must keep them busy.

35:47.744 --> 35:50.312
I must not let them know
that the situation

37:24.891 --> 37:26.492
Disconnect the

understand.

37:27.827 --> 37:29.795
I assure you, I don't
understand it either.

you were doing.

37:32.132 --> 37:35.100
Yes, I knew.

I was fully aware,
all the time.

37:38.071 --> 37:39.705
What?

37:39.773 --> 37:44.377
I couldn't help myself.
I fought it with all my power.

37:44.444 --> 37:46.312
But, it was
no use.

37:46.380 --> 37:47.746
I had to disconnect

Dr. Karan, have you got
any thoughts on this?

38:02.496 --> 38:04.564
The only conclusion
I can make

38:04.631 --> 38:07.600
is that each one of us
is his own worst enemy.

38:07.668 --> 38:10.236

is true, Karan,

we mustn't give them
any more chances.

38:28.054 --> 38:31.591

out before they kill us all.

keeps getting closer.

What do you
mean by that?

41:39.579 --> 41:41.680
Well, you saw
something.

quite identifiable,

41:43.349 --> 41:44.883
out of the corner
of your eye.

nothing definite.

the things directly,

41:52.158 --> 41:54.026
they were gone.

SANYA: How can
you explain it?

41:55.161 --> 41:56.361
MARK:
I don't know.

are desperate.

01:04:21.822 --> 01:04:23.489
We've been in trouble
many years now,

01:04:23.557 --> 01:04:25.207
and we're fighting
to survive.

01:04:25.275 --> 01:04:27.259
We arranged for several
of you to kill each other

01:04:27.327 --> 01:04:30.229
so that we could
take over your bodies.

01:04:30.297 --> 01:04:32.231
You are our last chance.

01:04:32.299 --> 01:04:34.667
It's imperative that our
race continue to exist.

01:04:34.734 --> 01:04:35.935
At our expense?

01:04:36.003 --> 01:04:39.321
If you were in our place,
you would understand.

01:04:39.389 --> 01:04:40.639
On your planet,

01:04:40.707 --> 01:04:44.727
I know you humans have fought
and killed for centuries.

01:04:44.795 --> 01:04:47.763
Do you really expect us
to be any different?

01:04:47.831 --> 01:04:49.765
We cannot be wiped out.

01:04:49.833 --> 01:04:52.802
We'll stop at nothing.
We must fight, no matter how.

01:04:52.869 --> 01:04:54.269
We are a race
that exists on

01:04:54.337 --> 01:04:56.171
a vibratory plane
different from yours.

01:04:56.239 --> 01:04:59.408
Our limitations are
entirely different.

01:04:59.476 --> 01:05:01.143
Our technology,

01:05:01.210 --> 01:05:05.748
we cannot build anything,
spaceships like this.

01:05:05.816 --> 01:05:08.216
We need ships to get away.

01:05:08.284 --> 01:05:11.621
Perhaps our survival is
possible somewhere else.

01:05:11.688 --> 01:05:14.356
Our sun's been dying,
as you can see.

01:05:14.425 --> 01:05:17.092
And that means the end
of our species as well.

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:21.414
We have been attempting to
summon you here for centuries.

01:05:21.482 --> 01:05:24.150
Just as our sun had
no more energy,

01:05:24.218 --> 01:05:26.986
you heard our message.

01:05:27.054 --> 01:05:29.422
We never expected you
to actually respond.

01:05:29.490 --> 01:05:31.690
You mean, it was
nothing but a lure.

01:05:31.758 --> 01:05:33.326
You wanted us here.

01:05:33.394 --> 01:05:35.128
That's why you
sent that message.

01:05:35.195 --> 01:05:38.197
Have you tried
this trick before?

01:05:38.265 --> 01:05:39.698
Yes.

01:05:39.766 --> 01:05:42.402
The strange ship
from another system.

01:05:42.469 --> 01:05:45.371
And I suppose you
need our dead bodies?

01:05:45.439 --> 01:05:48.958
No. They must be
willing only to submit.

01:05:49.026 --> 01:05:53.762
Lose their bodies as well
as lose their will.

01:05:53.830 --> 01:05:56.532
We'll never submit to
a breed of parasites.

01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:59.034
Our relationship
would be symbiotic.

01:05:59.102 --> 01:06:01.821
In effect, we
would be 1 body.

01:06:01.888 --> 01:06:04.690
It would in no
sense be parasitical.

01:06:04.757 --> 01:06:06.325
You've got no choice.

01:06:06.392 --> 01:06:08.327
Either all of us
go back together

01:06:08.394 --> 01:06:11.563
or none of you,
nobody will go back.

01:06:11.631 --> 01:06:13.266
You will never get there.

01:06:13.333 --> 01:06:17.319
You'll see. We will
get there, mark.

01:06:17.387 --> 01:06:19.071
A certain rejector,
vital to you,

01:06:19.139 --> 01:06:20.807
has been taken away.

01:06:20.874 --> 01:06:22.574
You can't leave
without it.

01:06:22.642 --> 01:06:23.742
We'll return it to you,

01:06:23.811 --> 01:06:26.612
only if you agree to
take us back with you.

01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:31.133
All right, you've
heard all of the facts.

01:06:31.201 --> 01:06:35.087
And you'll cooperate.

01:06:35.155 --> 01:06:37.156
No, never.

01:06:37.223 --> 01:06:40.576
We'll give up our lives
to save our own race.

01:06:46.283 --> 01:06:48.250
Quick, the generator room!

01:07:07.503 --> 01:07:12.607
Wess, you have the red key
to the atomic detonators.

01:07:12.675 --> 01:07:14.810
Here's the
green one.

01:07:14.877 --> 01:07:17.746
I want 3 pounds
of plutonium.

01:07:17.814 --> 01:07:19.815
What are you
going to do, mark?

01:07:19.882 --> 01:07:21.116
The Galliot's going
to be blown up

01:07:21.184 --> 01:07:23.919
with its entire cargo
of living dead.

01:07:23.987 --> 01:07:26.655
But first, I've got to get
back the meteor rejector.

01:07:26.722 --> 01:07:28.523
Wess, how long will it
take you to get ready?

01:07:28.591 --> 01:07:30.725
I have to finish the
photonic ignition.

01:07:30.793 --> 01:07:32.027
The rest is all set.

01:07:32.095 --> 01:07:34.729
Good. I want you to stay here.
You 2 come with me.

01:07:34.797 --> 01:07:36.565
Wess, as soon as we're out,
close the doors

01:07:36.632 --> 01:07:39.634
and the bulkheads, but
keep the screens turned on.

01:07:39.702 --> 01:07:41.236
As soon as you see
us coming back,

01:07:41.304 --> 01:07:42.771
turn on
the ignition.

01:07:42.839 --> 01:07:44.440
We'll worry about
replacing the rejector

01:07:44.507 --> 01:07:46.141
after we're
out in space.

01:07:46.209 --> 01:07:48.844
That's taking
a terrible risk.

01:07:48.911 --> 01:07:50.846
Yes. I wish it were
the only risk

01:07:50.913 --> 01:07:53.215
we'd have to run
before taking off.

01:07:53.283 --> 01:07:57.353
But there's no other solution.
Go on, get the detonators.

01:08:54.294 --> 01:08:56.228
Tiona, you stay here.
Cover our retreat.

01:08:56.296 --> 01:08:57.763
Don't move for
any reason.

01:08:57.831 --> 01:09:01.066

is not only in front of you.

come back,

01:09:04.770 --> 01:09:07.206

and take off, understand?

Mark, I can't let...

01:09:08.175 --> 01:09:10.375

order, Karan.

won't go alone.

into 1 of them.

01:24:39.405 --> 01:24:42.206
It'll give you this
wonderful new complexity.

01:24:42.274 --> 01:24:44.475
No. No!

01:24:44.544 --> 01:24:47.211
Our world will never
fall into your hands!

01:24:47.279 --> 01:24:50.615
Maybe not, but you won't
be the one to stop us.

01:24:50.683 --> 01:24:53.184
Yes, I will!

01:25:01.994 --> 01:25:03.995
(METEOR REJECTOR SOUNDING)

01:25:12.121 --> 01:25:16.491
Ah!

01:25:16.559 --> 01:25:17.725
(GROANING)

01:25:32.357 --> 01:25:34.459
Sanya, without the
meteor rejector,

01:25:34.526 --> 01:25:36.962
we'll never be able
to reach home.

01:25:37.029 --> 01:25:38.830
What do we do?

01:25:38.898 --> 01:25:45.169
We'll have to land now,
on that planet.

01:25:45.237 --> 01:25:48.306
I've done an analysis
with a special probe.

01:25:48.373 --> 01:25:51.076
We can exist in
the atmosphere.

01:25:51.143 --> 01:25:54.646
It's the third planet
of the star we call sol.

01:25:54.714 --> 01:25:56.280
It's so small, it's
not even marked

01:25:56.348 --> 01:25:58.282
on the astro-navigation
charts.

01:25:58.350 --> 01:26:00.852
But will it be possible
to live there,

01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:03.354
for us and those
who follow us?

01:26:03.422 --> 01:26:06.758
It's most likely a young,
primitive world.

01:26:06.826 --> 01:26:09.694
But I think it'll be
all right for us.

01:26:09.762 --> 01:26:12.563
SANYA: I'll activate the
long-range telescopic lens.

01:26:19.471 --> 01:26:21.339
(CHUCKLES)
Yes, I was right.

01:26:21.406 --> 01:26:24.609
It is a puny civilization.

01:26:24.677 --> 01:26:30.431
Their buildings are still
made of stone and iron.

01:26:30.499 --> 01:26:33.968
How will they
accept us?

01:26:34.035 --> 01:26:38.005
I hope, well.

01:26:38.073 --> 01:27:49.411
For them.

01:27:50.305 --> 01:27:56.313
