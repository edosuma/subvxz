(Chair squeaks)

04:18.050 --> 04:19.718
You got sad eyes.

04:22.721 --> 04:24.890
Not my usual pick-up line, but...

04:25.891 --> 04:30.771
I just sensed you are a man
running from shadows.

04:35.067 --> 04:36.818
What's your usual pick-up line?

04:38.278 --> 04:41.907
When I see a guy
alone at the bar

04:42.449 --> 04:44.117
at 3:00 in the morning,

04:44.701 --> 04:49.456
I lean in real close
and whisper in his ear:

04:50.249 --> 04:54.127
"For 510 bucks,
we can spend an hour.

04:54.503 --> 04:57.297
For 1,000,
we can spend a night."

04:59.466 --> 05:00.592
Why 510?

05:02.636 --> 05:07.099
'Cause the ATM
only spits out 20s.

05:07.683 --> 05:11.520
I've never had a john ask me
to break a note.

05:13.856 --> 05:15.691
That's actually smart.

05:20.571 --> 05:21.780
So?

05:23.240 --> 05:25.450
(Indistinct chatter

Jimmy Jayne.

07:31.493 --> 07:33.036
JIMMY:
You sure about this?

07:33.120 --> 07:34.830
YOUNG WOMAN:
I'm sure, I'm sure.

07:37.165 --> 07:38.125
Okay.

07:49.052 --> 07:50.053
Okay.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.515
Who's Shelby?

07:54.433 --> 07:56.143
She rocks my world.

07:56.518 --> 07:57.895
You're a lucky gal.

07:58.812 --> 07:59.938
Yeah, we both are.

08:00.022 --> 08:01.273
Right there?

08:04.234 --> 08:05.194
Hold on.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.076
James Jayne?

08:13.410 --> 08:14.536
Yeah.

08:14.620 --> 08:16.455
That's what it says
on my license.

08:18.415 --> 08:19.625
Detective Freeman.

08:19.958 --> 08:21.627
This is Detective Vargas.

08:21.919 --> 08:22.878
Hi.

08:22.961 --> 08:24.087
JIMMY:
Okay.

08:24.588 --> 08:27.466
Yeah, your old man
was on the force, wasn't he?

08:27.549 --> 08:29.134
14th precinct.

08:29.218 --> 08:31.803
Hmm, how's he doing?

08:32.971 --> 08:35.224
I don't think
he's doing much of anything.

08:35.307 --> 08:37.976
Spends his days
at the Fitzgerald Cemetery.

08:38.059 --> 08:39.061
He was a good cop.

08:39.144 --> 08:40.479
Damn good cop.

08:40.562 --> 08:42.272
Always paid his tab.

08:43.273 --> 08:45.400
Did you ever consider the force?

08:45.484 --> 08:47.236
Yeah. You ever think about it?

08:48.445 --> 08:49.571
No, never.

08:55.536 --> 08:57.496
That's yours, right?

08:57.579 --> 09:00.123
I mean, it's my shop's lighter.

09:00.207 --> 09:01.208
Right.

09:01.917 --> 09:05.128
James-- sorry,
may I call you, "James"?

09:05.212 --> 09:07.965
The reason that we're here
is we need to talk to you

09:08.048 --> 09:09.758
about the four dead girls.

09:09.842 --> 09:10.968
Okay?

09:11.051 --> 09:12.845
What's that have to do with me?

09:12.928 --> 09:16.223
The lighter,
it was found at the crime scene.

09:16.306 --> 09:17.599
What's your point?

09:18.767 --> 09:20.435
What was it doing there?

09:20.519 --> 09:22.187
I don't know what it's fucking
doing there.

09:22.271 --> 09:25.274
I once found my lighter floating
in a urinal at a Duke's.

09:27.568 --> 09:28.652
Am I a suspect?

09:28.735 --> 09:29.862
VARGAS: You were seen
with one of the victims

09:29.945 --> 09:31.029
at Rocka's, okay.

09:31.280 --> 09:32.531
Thing about Rocka's,

09:32.614 --> 09:34.157
it's over on the other side
of town

09:34.241 --> 09:35.784
and there are 100
good watering holes

09:35.868 --> 09:37.035
in between here and there,
right?

09:37.119 --> 09:37.995
Yeah.

09:38.161 --> 09:40.205
Yeah, again, again,
what's your point?

09:40.289 --> 09:43.959
My point is why drive
all the way over there

09:44.042 --> 09:46.503
like I was saying,
it's a long ways away.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.964
Sentimental reasons.

09:49.047 --> 09:50.632
VARGAS:
Such as?

09:52.676 --> 09:54.261
My mother used to work there.

09:54.344 --> 09:57.055
Okay. Behind the bar?

09:57.139 --> 09:58.515
No, not behind the bar.

09:58.599 --> 09:59.808
Oh.

10:00.142 --> 10:02.227
Uh, Jimmy, excuse my partner.

10:02.603 --> 10:06.148
He still doesn't know what side
of the bed to wake up on.

10:06.231 --> 10:07.107
VARGAS:
He's right.

10:07.191 --> 10:08.525
We have some photos,

10:08.609 --> 10:11.612
maybe you could uh, ID
some of the victims.

10:11.695 --> 10:12.779
That'd be helpful.

10:12.905 --> 10:14.698
Holy shit,
you don't even know their names.

10:14.781 --> 10:17.951
James, we're gonna need to talk
to you in private, okay?

10:18.035 --> 10:19.453
The sooner, the better.

10:20.579 --> 10:22.331
All right, give me an hour.
I got a customer.

10:22.456 --> 10:24.333
No, we need to talk to you
right now,

10:24.458 --> 10:26.877
so the tramp stamp
will have to wait.

10:27.085 --> 10:28.504
How you doin', darlin'?

10:28.587 --> 10:30.255
What you gonna get, a unicorn?

10:30.339 --> 10:31.381
(Chuckles)

10:34.259 --> 10:36.845
(♪♪♪)

10:44.478 --> 10:46.230
FREEMAN:
I hope you can be discrete.

10:47.564 --> 10:51.443
Last thing we need
is a media circus.

10:51.527 --> 10:54.488
Yeah, he's right,
'cause if that happens,

10:54.571 --> 10:56.907
then the D.A.,
he puts pressure on us

10:56.990 --> 10:59.993
to pin it on some poor schmuck.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.538
All right. I'll go ahead
and get started, right, boss?

11:02.621 --> 11:04.206
-Yes.
-Okay.

11:05.249 --> 11:07.918
For the record,
I'm Detective Vargas.

11:08.377 --> 11:09.711
That's Detective Freeman.

11:09.795 --> 11:11.255
And we're conducting
an interview

11:11.338 --> 11:17.261
with Mr. James Jayne
concerning case V-7-7-4-3.

11:17.344 --> 11:18.846
They suffer?

11:18.929 --> 11:20.180
What do you think?

11:20.264 --> 11:21.640
I think it's a fair
fucking question,

11:21.723 --> 11:22.850
that's what I think.

11:22.933 --> 11:25.143
Yeah, they suffered.

11:27.229 --> 11:28.856
I imagine
you already questioned

11:28.939 --> 11:30.649
the guests, staff?

11:30.941 --> 11:33.318
Since 5:00 a.m. this morning.

11:33.402 --> 11:35.362
63 rooms.

11:35.445 --> 11:37.614
VARGAS:
Yeah, nobody suspicious.

11:37.781 --> 11:41.660
Nobody caught our attention,
except you.

11:43.662 --> 11:44.872
Security cameras?

11:46.164 --> 11:47.541
They didn't have any
at the rat trap

11:47.624 --> 11:48.542
they found 'em at,

11:48.625 --> 11:50.794
but they're on camera
leaving the bar.

11:50.878 --> 11:53.255
Then you're on camera
a few seconds later

11:53.338 --> 11:55.465
following 'em out the door.

11:55.966 --> 11:57.551
I had a drink, and I left.

11:57.634 --> 11:58.635
FREEMAN:
What time?

11:59.094 --> 12:01.096
2:30. Give or take.

12:01.180 --> 12:02.973
Talk to anybody
while you were there?

12:04.474 --> 12:05.350
JIMMY:
Yeah.

12:05.434 --> 12:06.727
VARGAS:
What were you doing there?

12:06.810 --> 12:08.395
(Sighs) I was fucking guys.

12:08.478 --> 12:10.564
-FREEMAN: Easy.
-It's just juries,

12:10.647 --> 12:13.734
they don't look real favorably
on uncooperative witnesses.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.153
-Right?
-Right.

12:16.528 --> 12:17.988
Look, why don't you just
show me the pictures?

12:18.071 --> 12:19.531
'Cause something tells me
somebody told you

12:19.615 --> 12:21.158
I was with the girls that night.

12:21.450 --> 12:22.743
You want to see the pictures?

12:22.826 --> 12:24.745
Sure,
we'll show you the pictures.

12:27.039 --> 12:28.624
Pretty sordid.

12:29.291 --> 12:31.752
Let me just start back
at the beginning here.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.295
Here we go.

12:33.378 --> 12:35.881
Huh, pretty gnarly, right?

12:36.215 --> 12:37.174
Gnarly?

12:37.257 --> 12:38.926
Recognize any of them?

12:39.301 --> 12:44.973
Boom, boom, boom,
what you think?

12:46.266 --> 12:47.226
That's pretty bad.

12:47.309 --> 12:48.477
JIMMY:
Go back.

12:50.771 --> 12:52.731
-That's Star.
-VARGAS: Huh.

12:52.814 --> 12:54.816
JIMMY: That's what she told me
her name was.

12:55.150 --> 12:56.860
You ever seen
these girls before?

12:58.237 --> 12:59.863
Not before last night.

12:59.947 --> 13:03.116
You talked to Star,
what about?

13:03.200 --> 13:04.993
-Business.
-What?

13:05.077 --> 13:07.412
-Business.
-Tattoos or movies?

13:07.538 --> 13:08.914
JIMMY:
She was an actor.

13:09.540 --> 13:10.874
Aspiring actor.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.418
Am I the only suspect?

13:13.502 --> 13:15.379
FREEMAN:
Person of interest.

13:15.462 --> 13:19.508
VARGAS: So Star, I'm assuming
she was a working girl.

13:19.591 --> 13:20.884
Yeah.

13:20.968 --> 13:22.803
Did she make you an offer?

13:24.429 --> 13:25.430
JIMMY:
Of course she did.

13:25.514 --> 13:26.765
VARGAS:
Did you take her up on it?

13:26.849 --> 13:28.100
Or did you try and bargain
with her?

13:28.183 --> 13:30.060
Maybe when you tried
to bargain with her,

13:30.269 --> 13:32.229
you kind of made her feel
a little cheap--

13:32.312 --> 13:33.188
JIMMY:
Fucking what?

13:33.272 --> 13:35.023
VARGAS: Then she said
something nasty, who knows?

13:35.107 --> 13:36.900
Maybe that hurt your feelings,
and then you thought,

13:36.984 --> 13:37.943
"Hey, I'm really gonna let her have it."

13:38.026 --> 13:39.736
-(Overlapping speech)
-Double fucking talk.

13:40.112 --> 13:41.321
Did you hook up with her?

13:44.074 --> 13:46.159
No. I told her I was meeting
with somebody after.

13:46.243 --> 13:47.703
FREEMAN:
And who is that?

13:48.245 --> 13:50.163
This girl I run around with. Christine.

13:50.956 --> 13:52.207
-Okay.
-Are we done here?

13:52.291 --> 13:54.668
No. So I'm just trying to get
all this straight in my head,

13:54.751 --> 13:56.170
-maybe you can help me, boss?
-Yeah.

13:56.253 --> 13:59.173
-So the bar, it closes at 2:30.
-FREEMAN: Right.

13:59.256 --> 14:01.675
VARGAS: That gives you 45 minutes
to kill 'em.

14:01.758 --> 14:02.801
Stage 'em.

14:02.885 --> 14:06.263
Then mosey on over
to this Christine girl.

14:06.722 --> 14:09.099
And you asked,
"Did they suffer?"

14:09.183 --> 14:10.559
Their necks were broken.

14:10.642 --> 14:11.810
All four of 'em.

14:11.894 --> 14:13.896
Of course,
that's not real difficult.

14:13.979 --> 14:17.357
When you got poor helpless girls
all whacked out on

14:17.816 --> 14:20.777
junk and blow,
God knows what else.

14:20.861 --> 14:24.239
Now the only
suspect description we got

14:24.323 --> 14:27.326
is of a Caucasian shitkicker.

14:27.743 --> 14:29.411
You seen any of those lately?

14:31.747 --> 14:33.040
Get the fuck out of my shop.

14:33.123 --> 14:34.666
I actually think we're done here

14:34.750 --> 14:36.919
and we probably don't need
to tell you this,

14:37.002 --> 14:40.464
but don't leave the country,
hell, don't leave the county.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.341
We can haul you in
on a Ramey warrant

14:42.424 --> 14:43.467
anytime, okay.

14:43.550 --> 14:46.303
So yeah, you're still a suspect,
got it?

14:46.762 --> 14:48.847
Don't worry,
if you get found guilty,

14:48.931 --> 14:51.433
we'll walk you down
to the electric chair ourselves.

14:51.517 --> 14:52.768
It's like that
old gospel number,

14:52.851 --> 14:54.269
You'll Never Walk Alone.

14:54.353 --> 14:55.270
Let's hit it, boss.

14:55.354 --> 14:56.647
Good talking to you.

15:01.860 --> 15:03.362
Nice spot.

15:08.700 --> 15:11.203
(♪♪♪)

15:13.247 --> 15:14.540
(Grunts)
Fuck!

15:21.547 --> 15:23.674
(Indistinct chatter
in background)

15:27.344 --> 15:28.470
Christine.

15:29.137 --> 15:30.097
Hey.

15:31.974 --> 15:33.892
One sec, come here.

15:39.398 --> 15:40.732
You get my text?

15:42.067 --> 15:45.070
Cops calling on me at work
ain't a good look, Jimmy.

15:46.655 --> 15:48.532
They wanted to confirm you
were on your way to see me

15:48.657 --> 15:49.825
last night.

15:51.368 --> 15:52.786
What'd you say?

15:53.120 --> 15:54.329
I told 'em, yeah.

15:54.830 --> 15:57.624
The bald one,
he thought I'd be all bent

15:57.708 --> 16:00.294
about you flirting
with those poor girls.

16:00.627 --> 16:04.047
I told 'em, nah,
it ain't like that.

16:04.381 --> 16:08.427
He flirts with everybody,
that's what makes him Jimmy.

16:09.553 --> 16:10.888
Attagirl.

16:10.971 --> 16:12.472
The other one,

16:12.556 --> 16:15.893
he acts all best friends
bonding shit,

16:15.976 --> 16:18.604
wasn't shy about doing
a little flirting himself.

16:19.855 --> 16:21.190
Fuckin' asshole.

16:22.566 --> 16:24.860

19:14.738 --> 19:15.948
What do you want?

19:16.823 --> 19:18.367
Anything more on the four girls?

19:20.118 --> 19:21.370

It's an ongoing investigation.

19:26.083 --> 19:28.043
And no other suspects but me?

19:28.377 --> 19:31.171
Let's just say
you're a person of interest

19:31.255 --> 19:32.464
and we'll leave it at that.

19:32.840 --> 19:34.091
Okay?

19:36.093 --> 19:37.553
You think I did it?

19:38.428 --> 19:40.722
Hey, the evidence
says what it says.

19:40.806 --> 19:43.892
I'm gonna text you my number

I need to see you.

20:12.254 --> 20:13.839
Of course, bro,
anything for you.

20:13.922 --> 20:15.340
You want to uh,
meet up next week?

20:15.424 --> 20:17.217
No, today would be better.

20:17.301 --> 20:19.052
Uh, I'm on set, bro.

20:19.136 --> 20:20.804
All right, text me the address,
call your security,

20:20.888 --> 20:22.222
let 'em know I'm coming by.

20:22.306 --> 20:23.599
Okay, tight.

20:23.682 --> 20:25.893
Uh hey, hey, bring your kit.

20:26.268 --> 20:27.519
Yeah, all right. Whatever.

Can someone get this asshole
out of my eyeline?

20:55.839 --> 20:57.799
Again, dude. It happened again!

20:58.800 --> 21:00.385
Fucking day,
it's something else.

21:02.262 --> 21:03.889
Jesus, what the fuck...

21:12.397 --> 21:14.066
(Indistinct chatter
in background)

21:14.566 --> 21:15.943
Goddamn rookies.

21:17.736 --> 21:19.196
What's up, big dog?

21:19.446 --> 21:22.157
See me looking like a badass,
shooting these fucking guns.

21:22.324 --> 21:24.326
They should let me shoot
a real one, huh?

21:24.785 --> 21:26.453
Ain't gonna make the show
easier to watch.

21:26.537 --> 21:27.788
(Chuckles)

21:27.955 --> 21:30.541
I know you didn't just come here
to bruise my ego.

21:30.874 --> 21:33.460
Rub your paycheck on it,
that'll make it feel better.

21:33.544 --> 21:34.795
Yeah, that's good.

21:35.587 --> 21:37.756
All right, Jimmy,
what's the favor?

21:39.007 --> 21:40.717
You're in the scene, right?

21:40.801 --> 21:42.803
I do okay. It's not really
your vibe though,

21:42.886 --> 21:44.012
if that's what you're asking.

21:45.597 --> 21:47.641
Don't use that tone of voice
with me.

21:48.392 --> 21:50.519
Remember who kept you safe
on the inside.

21:52.646 --> 21:53.689
Yeah, I know.

21:53.772 --> 21:55.399
You know how grateful I am that
you protected me

21:55.482 --> 21:56.483
when I was in there.

21:59.736 --> 22:01.113
I bet your friends think
you're tough

22:01.196 --> 22:04.741
doing three months hard time
for a fucking DUI or whatever.

22:06.702 --> 22:08.370
I wonder what they'd say
if they find out

22:08.453 --> 22:10.205
you cried yourself
to sleep every night

22:10.289 --> 22:12.583
worried Kratos from Cell Block E
was gonna make you

22:12.666 --> 22:14.334
his little fucking bitch.

22:14.418 --> 22:16.378
I'm grateful
that you fucked him up for me.

22:18.172 --> 22:19.506
How grateful?

22:22.092 --> 22:23.552
Anything for a friend, Jimmy.

22:24.761 --> 22:26.221
Got your kit?

22:26.305 --> 22:27.431
Yeah.

22:27.514 --> 22:28.432
Okay.

22:28.515 --> 22:30.309
Yeah, all right.
Come on.

22:38.442 --> 22:40.360
Heard they're already planning
a rip-off episode

22:40.444 --> 22:41.403
about the dead girls.

22:41.486 --> 22:42.696
Bullshit.

22:42.779 --> 22:43.989
I swear to God.

22:44.615 --> 22:47.034
The writer's PA with the fat ass
told me last night.

22:47.117 --> 22:48.327
That is tasteless.

22:49.661 --> 22:50.996
I knew one of 'em.

22:51.580 --> 22:52.539
From where?

22:53.540 --> 22:55.000
Some party.

22:55.542 --> 22:56.668
Whose?

22:58.003 --> 23:00.047
Persi Muleeney, something.

23:00.464 --> 23:02.424
Get the fuck outta here.
That's a made-up name.

23:02.508 --> 23:04.593
I swear to God, man,
she was all over me.

23:05.260 --> 23:06.595
What was her name?

23:06.762 --> 23:08.555
BOURKE: She didn't tell me
her real name.

23:09.348 --> 23:10.557
Don't tell me.

23:11.058 --> 23:12.059
"If you forget..."

23:12.142 --> 23:13.352
BOURKE:
"...you just gotta look up."

23:13.435 --> 23:14.853
-JIMMY: Yeah.
-BOURKE: You knew Star?

23:14.937 --> 23:16.063
Briefly.

23:16.813 --> 23:18.815
Tell me about the guy
running the party.

23:18.899 --> 23:21.443
BOURKE: Persi? I-- I didn't know
it was his party.

23:22.444 --> 23:24.530
Finds girls on OnlyFans
and Craigslist,

23:24.613 --> 23:26.782
turns 'em into porn stars
and escorts.

23:27.074 --> 23:29.076
They float around the scene
for a little bit

23:29.326 --> 23:30.994
then they just disappear,
that's all I know.

23:31.119 --> 23:32.412
What do you mean disappear?

23:32.538 --> 23:34.164
BOURKE: I mean they go back
to bumfuck Idaho

23:34.248 --> 23:35.541
wherever the hell
they came from.

23:37.501 --> 23:39.211
Man, this J-bird
fucking with you?

23:39.294 --> 23:41.380
No, man, we're all right,
aren't we?

23:42.089 --> 23:44.716
-Are we?
-Yeah, we're good.

23:44.925 --> 23:46.009
BOURKE:
This is Jimmy Jayne.

23:46.093 --> 23:47.678
This guy's a motherfucking
legend right here.

23:47.761 --> 23:48.929
-True genius.
-Pleasure to meet you.

23:49.012 --> 23:51.098
Oh, so you guys inside together?

23:51.348 --> 23:53.267
-How'd you know?
-Come on, man.

23:53.350 --> 23:55.269
'Cause all your other friends
that come here,

23:55.352 --> 23:56.562
look like Ken dolls.

23:57.020 --> 23:58.021
No offense.

23:58.105 --> 23:59.189
BOURKE: Yeah, fucking right
we were in.

23:59.273 --> 24:00.941
This dude did half the art
in San Quentin.

24:01.024 --> 24:02.192
Why don't you tell him
about the time

24:02.276 --> 24:03.902
I fucked up Kratos in the yard?

24:03.986 --> 24:05.195
You know the story.

24:06.154 --> 24:09.241
Yeah, I remember that, sure.

24:10.701 --> 24:13.662
He was uh-- he was fresh meat.

24:13.745 --> 24:15.539
Wouldn't let anybody
fuck with him, so he beat a man

24:15.622 --> 24:18.250
unconscious on his first night
with his bare hands.

24:18.792 --> 24:19.918
Yeah.

24:20.002 --> 24:21.295
Bullshit.

24:21.795 --> 24:24.256
-That's a fucking lie.
-It's a lie.

24:24.339 --> 24:25.966
ROY:
Hey, but you're a great friend

24:26.049 --> 24:28.177
to try to make this
punk-ass look good.

24:28.260 --> 24:29.928
Hey, you can't talk to me
like that, bro.

24:30.012 --> 24:31.221
You're a fucking set mechanic.

24:31.305 --> 24:32.723
I'm number one
on the call sheet, all right.

24:32.931 --> 24:35.017
Calm down, kid. Calm down.

24:35.100 --> 24:38.437
You took this gig for money
just like everybody else.

24:38.520 --> 24:39.855
We're making art, all right.

24:39.938 --> 24:41.023
-Art?
-Yeah.

24:41.106 --> 24:45.027
This show makes a dumpster fire
look like Citizen Kane.

24:45.152 --> 24:46.778
Yeah, well, this show
is number one in the country,

24:46.862 --> 24:48.030
we are number one.

24:48.113 --> 24:50.991
That says more about society
than the quality of your show.

24:51.366 --> 24:53.410
Hey, listen,
I have a 66 Chevelle

24:53.493 --> 24:55.037
that's got a bum clutch.

24:55.329 --> 24:56.955
-You got a card?
-Yeah.

24:58.457 --> 25:00.959
-Here man, call me anytime.
-Thank you.

25:01.043 --> 25:02.377
-You guys good?
-Yes, sir.

25:04.171 --> 25:05.756
Where you wanna do this?

25:05.839 --> 25:08.008
Well, I want 1-1-7 right here.

25:08.091 --> 25:10.344
It's how many people watched
last week's episode.

25:10.594 --> 25:11.637
117?

25:11.845 --> 25:13.305
Million, yeah.

25:13.889 --> 25:16.016
I know, I can't believe people
pay to watch this shit either.

25:16.099 --> 25:17.351
Let's go in my trailer.

25:22.606 --> 25:23.690
FILM CREW MEMBER 1:
Action!

25:23.774 --> 25:24.942
(Thud)

25:27.361 --> 25:28.862
-Dennis!
-Hey, dude.

25:29.988 --> 25:30.948
Dennis, up!

25:31.031 --> 25:32.032
Oh, shoot!

25:34.243 --> 25:36.954
(Gun blaring)
Fuck you, motherfuckers!

25:40.040 --> 25:42.709
(♪♪♪)

26:15.325 --> 26:16.493
Hi.

26:17.494 --> 26:18.704
Now what?

26:19.079 --> 26:21.540
Well, found your fingerprints
on your lighter.

26:21.623 --> 26:23.041
JIMMY:
Who'd have thought?

26:23.125 --> 26:24.042
And?

26:24.126 --> 26:26.962
We got motive, we got access,

26:27.504 --> 26:31.258
and we're one hair follicle away
from writing your warrant.

26:32.176 --> 26:33.385
How'd you find me?

26:33.468 --> 26:36.263
VARGAS: You got a GPS
in your pocket, buddy.

26:36.346 --> 26:37.472
(Vargas chuckling)

26:37.639 --> 26:39.016
You need a warrant
to track a phone.

26:39.099 --> 26:41.518
You know you're actually correct
about that.

26:41.602 --> 26:44.354
But the thing is judges
these days, they're real busy

26:44.438 --> 26:45.731
and they know
we're the good guys.

26:45.814 --> 26:47.608
So they kinda let it slide.

26:47.816 --> 26:50.986
Now, you gonna offer me
a cigarette or what?

26:52.571 --> 26:55.157
No, it's cool, I actually quit.
Here's the deal.

26:55.407 --> 26:57.951
Everybody I talk to
across the board,

26:58.035 --> 27:00.412
they all say
you're a stand-up guy,

27:00.495 --> 27:02.247
except for the five years
in the pen

27:02.331 --> 27:04.458
for putting a guy
in a wheelchair.

27:06.335 --> 27:08.253
I didn't start that fight.

27:08.337 --> 27:10.464
But you sure ended it,
didn't you?

27:11.048 --> 27:13.091
And I bet you'd do it
all over again.

27:15.260 --> 27:17.221
Came at me with a screwdriver.

27:17.304 --> 27:19.640
Screwdriver.
Shit, that's a deadly weapon.

27:22.976 --> 27:24.728
You know a guy named Persi?

27:25.103 --> 27:26.313
I don't remember his last name.

27:26.396 --> 27:27.814
Fucking Persi something,
whatever.

27:27.898 --> 27:29.191
Why?

27:29.733 --> 27:31.276
Used to run with Star.

27:31.485 --> 27:33.195
You playing detective now?

27:33.987 --> 27:36.490
Just concerned citizen.

27:36.865 --> 27:38.242
I like that.

27:38.700 --> 27:43.372
You know, uh, I found out
why you hang out at Rocka's bar.

27:46.667 --> 27:48.961
Should have just told me
your mom was a working gal.

27:49.044 --> 27:50.212
There's no shame in it.

27:50.629 --> 27:53.257
Detective Freeman,
he told me that was her spot

27:53.340 --> 27:55.509
until, you know,
she went missing.

27:55.717 --> 27:56.969
And of course, your dad,

27:57.052 --> 27:59.179
he lost his mind
trying to find her.

27:59.263 --> 28:01.306
I'm just saying, you know,
I-- I get it.

28:01.390 --> 28:04.518
I understand why you feel
so connected to the case.

28:05.686 --> 28:07.563
Sure do have a way with words.

28:07.855 --> 28:10.232
Hey pal, James, Jimmy,

28:10.315 --> 28:11.984
I uh-- you know,
that's as close

28:12.067 --> 28:14.319
as you're gonna get
to an apology from me.

28:14.778 --> 28:18.156
Yeah, fine, well...
I have to go.

28:18.365 --> 28:20.242
Just, hey, take it easy.

28:20.325 --> 28:21.702
Let us do our thing.

28:21.785 --> 28:23.954
Detective Freeman,
he's a great cop

28:24.037 --> 28:26.874
and me, I'm the best thing
that ever happened

28:26.957 --> 28:28.792
to the Robbery-Homicide Unit.

28:30.460 --> 28:32.421
How many cases
you close last year?

28:32.504 --> 28:34.256
You want my numbers now?
You want my stats?

28:34.339 --> 28:36.216
I mean, if they were any good,
you'd be squawking about 'em.

28:36.300 --> 28:37.551
Oh, come on.

28:38.051 --> 28:39.845
You speak to Star's family?

28:40.762 --> 28:42.097
Tell 'em what happened?

28:42.181 --> 28:44.683
Well, they disowned her
a long time ago,

28:44.766 --> 28:46.894
but they're raising her kid
as their own.

28:48.604 --> 28:49.897
How old?

28:50.147 --> 28:53.233
4. Actually the same age
as my boy Terry.

28:56.278 --> 28:59.990
James, just don't go kicking
the hornet's nest.

29:00.073 --> 29:00.949
'Course not.

29:01.200 --> 29:02.910
-You understand?
-Yes.

29:02.993 --> 29:04.745
Okay. I'll catch you later.

29:05.412 --> 29:08.248

ROY:
Hey man, don't fuck that paint.

34:01.750 --> 34:03.752
I can't be assed with an
L & D form.

34:03.836 --> 34:05.629
(Cellphone ringing)

34:06.713 --> 34:08.005
You got Roy.

34:08.257 --> 34:10.717
Roy, it's Jimmy.

34:11.217 --> 34:12.719
I met you on set.

34:12.803 --> 34:14.221
Hey, buddy, what's going on?

34:14.888 --> 34:16.764
Someone tried to run me down
just now.

34:16.849 --> 34:18.725
No shit.
Someone tried to kill you?

34:18.809 --> 34:20.561
Yeah. (Indistinct speech)

34:20.768 --> 34:21.853
That's not
what makes it personal,

34:21.978 --> 34:23.938
so much as they fucked up
my ride.

34:24.188 --> 34:25.482
Holy shit, man!

34:25.565 --> 34:26.859
You know who it was?

34:26.984 --> 34:29.152
If I did, I wouldn't say so
on the phone.

34:30.112 --> 34:32.739
You know what, it's nothing.

34:33.532 --> 34:35.409
It don't sound like nothing
to me, man,

34:35.492 --> 34:38.120
but what's it like to be you?

34:38.203 --> 34:40.205
It was a Rover Wagon.
It was super charged.

34:40.289 --> 34:42.081
Had some real fucking
balls to it.

34:42.498 --> 34:45.043
Still not the smartest way
to try to kill somebody.

34:45.127 --> 34:47.838
Yeah, maybe they're smarter
than you think, man.

34:48.463 --> 34:51.425
Random ex-con cut down
on the side of the road?

34:51.507 --> 34:52.592
Who'd give a shit?

34:52.967 --> 34:55.219
Yeah, that's one way to put it,
I guess.

34:55.596 --> 34:58.098
Rover's a lot bigger
than a bullet though, bro.

34:58.182 --> 35:00.350
Oh no, they came at me
with those, too.

35:01.476 --> 35:02.519
Listen...

35:04.104 --> 35:07.816
I got this feeling that
you might be able to uh,

35:08.358 --> 35:10.319
you know, get me
some sort of protection.

35:10.402 --> 35:11.528
You know what I'm talking about?

35:11.612 --> 35:13.405
10-4, good buddy.

35:13.488 --> 35:16.450
I know you're a kindred soul
of the heathen brethren.

35:17.659 --> 35:19.286
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

35:19.369 --> 35:20.829
Of course it's a yes, man.

35:20.913 --> 35:22.080
Send me the address.

35:22.748 --> 35:24.082
I'll text it to you.

35:27.794 --> 35:29.588
VARGAS:
So this doesn't add up.

35:30.714 --> 35:33.175
How does Jimmy go
from felony assault

35:33.258 --> 35:34.927
to multiple homicides?

35:36.720 --> 35:38.096
I don't get it.

35:38.764 --> 35:40.057
-The old days--
-Yeah.

35:40.140 --> 35:43.101
You told me about, you'd just
taken a telephone book to 'em.

35:43.185 --> 35:44.603
Now I gotta actually
question people

35:44.686 --> 35:46.855
-and go fucking by the book.
-Right.

35:47.147 --> 35:48.065
(Vargas chuckles)

35:48.148 --> 35:49.399
-Yeah.
-Pain in the ass.

35:52.152 --> 35:53.070
-Well--
-Mhmm.

35:53.237 --> 35:54.655
I guess I'll take care
of this here,

35:54.738 --> 35:56.532
-you gonna hit the game?
-Yeah.

35:56.615 --> 35:57.741
VARGAS:
Who is it this week?

35:57.824 --> 35:59.826
-Malibu.
-Right.

35:59.910 --> 36:01.745
If they don't beat them,
who can they beat?

36:01.828 --> 36:02.829
-Yeah.
-(Chuckles)

36:03.080 --> 36:04.164
Exactly.

36:06.041 --> 36:07.668
I'll take care of this,
all right.

36:07.751 --> 36:09.169
-All right.
-I got it.

36:09.545 --> 36:10.879
I hope they win.

36:18.262 --> 36:19.263
(Sighs)

36:22.975 --> 36:24.601
I didn't think you'd show.

36:24.977 --> 36:27.980
Every brother needs a keeper
from time to time.

36:28.397 --> 36:30.023
Are you sure you want this?

36:30.899 --> 36:33.485
I got someone trying to pin
a bunch of murders on me.

36:34.361 --> 36:35.529
I'm not going back inside,

36:35.612 --> 36:37.531
especially not for something
I didn't do.

36:37.614 --> 36:39.658
Easy, new friend, easy.

36:39.741 --> 36:41.243
The fuck am I into?

36:41.785 --> 36:43.453
Show business, son.

36:43.871 --> 36:46.373
It's the most gangster game
out there.

36:46.456 --> 36:47.833
You got family?

36:48.375 --> 36:50.335
No, not since my dad died.

36:50.419 --> 36:51.837
Hmm, how'd he go?

36:52.838 --> 36:54.089
Bottle.

36:54.173 --> 36:55.382
Hmm.

36:55.465 --> 36:57.050
Come here, let's do this.

37:05.809 --> 37:07.477
Your dad teach you how to shoot?

37:09.104 --> 37:10.022
All right.

37:10.939 --> 37:12.900
You got six rounds in there.

37:16.445 --> 37:17.696
There you go.

37:22.743 --> 37:24.328
How much do I owe you?

37:24.953 --> 37:25.913
Nothing, man.

37:25.996 --> 37:27.664
Just a favor down the line.

37:28.665 --> 37:29.750
All right.

37:30.542 --> 37:31.585
Anytime.

37:31.668 --> 37:33.212
Yeah, I'll hold you to that.

37:33.462 --> 37:35.797
But you be careful, man.

37:37.216 --> 37:38.967
-See you.
-Thank you.

38:12.709 --> 38:14.002

38:26.223 --> 38:28.267
I may have to get out of town.

38:28.350 --> 38:30.018
We should go somewhere.

38:30.310 --> 38:32.855
Huh, I got that ticket
to Berlin, baby.

38:34.982 --> 38:36.233
What ticket?

38:36.859 --> 38:38.193
I didn't tell you?

38:40.195 --> 38:41.822
I would have remembered.

38:41.905 --> 38:43.657
I'm leaving Monday.

38:44.449 --> 38:46.952
Sandy is there as an au pair,

38:47.995 --> 38:50.956
we'll hang,
I hear it's a good scene.

38:52.749 --> 38:54.084
Berlin?

38:55.419 --> 38:56.837
It's in Germany.

38:58.589 --> 38:59.798
Yeah.

39:02.342 --> 39:03.552

39:05.137 --> 39:07.222
You live in the moment, Jimmy.

39:10.475 --> 39:11.476
Yeah.

39:20.903 --> 39:22.070
Fucking Berlin.

39:57.481 --> 39:58.440
What's up, buddy?

39:58.524 --> 40:00.442
-How you doing?
-Good.

40:01.193 --> 40:02.444
I need a favor.

40:04.488 --> 40:05.697
(Scoffs)

40:05.781 --> 40:07.533
You know I can't get back
into the evidence locker.

40:07.616 --> 40:08.575
They won't let me back there.

40:08.659 --> 40:10.244
-It's not that kind of favor.
-What is it?

40:10.327 --> 40:12.538
I need you to run a name
through IVIS.

40:15.415 --> 40:16.750
What's the name?

40:16.834 --> 40:18.001
Oh fuck.

40:19.002 --> 40:20.212
Uh...

40:21.880 --> 40:23.882
Peter Mul...

40:25.050 --> 40:26.301
Persi Mul, something or other.

40:26.385 --> 40:28.345
Mul something.
What is that?

40:29.179 --> 40:30.597
Persi Muleeney?

That's it.

40:32.099 --> 40:33.141

40:33.642 --> 40:34.852
Man, he lives up on Mulholland.

40:34.935 --> 40:36.770
He's got an office down
on Skid Row.

40:36.854 --> 40:37.771
You know him?

40:37.855 --> 40:39.231
Yeah, everybody knows him.

40:39.314 --> 40:40.732
He's a popular guy.

40:41.108 --> 40:42.609
Give me a current address.

40:43.151 --> 40:44.152
(Pete sighs)

40:44.319 --> 40:45.654
Look, man, is this something
that's gonna come back

40:45.737 --> 40:47.447
-and bite me in the ass?
-No, never.

40:47.531 --> 40:48.782
-Yeah.
-Absolutely not.

40:48.866 --> 40:50.868
Yeah, I believe you again, huh?

40:53.745 --> 40:55.622
Look, man, you know
I'll lie on the stand, right,

40:55.706 --> 40:57.124
say you had a gun to my head.

40:59.084 --> 41:00.460
That's why I love you, brother.

41:01.044 --> 41:02.671
You really are LA's finest,
huh?

41:02.963 --> 41:04.173
Aww, that's sweet.
Fuck you, too.

41:04.256 --> 41:05.424
(Jimmy chuckles)

41:05.507 --> 41:07.176
Can you tell me
what he's driving?

41:12.764 --> 41:17.769
Seems his 2011 Land Rover
was reported stolen yesterday.

41:32.659 --> 41:34.369
You didn't get that from me.

41:37.748 --> 41:39.750
He's having a party
up at his place tonight.

41:40.584 --> 41:42.920
Lot of cops gonna be there,
'cause we get in free.

41:43.712 --> 41:44.588
Yeah.

41:44.922 --> 41:47.132
Seems he knows what lives
matter most.

41:49.218 --> 41:50.427
All right.

41:51.553 --> 41:52.554
Stay lucky, buddy.

41:53.305 --> 41:55.724
Next time have the decency
to buy me a fucking coffee.

42:41.103 --> 42:43.021
Yeah, 14th.

A really bad one.

44:42.057 --> 44:43.433

44:45.102 --> 44:47.062
I do want to hear a bad joke.

44:47.145 --> 44:48.188
Shoot.

44:49.231 --> 44:53.443
What are the three words

What are the three words

We're sweating like bullets,

Yo. You Persi?

Yeah, I'm sorry.

47:46.033 --> 47:47.034
I been to Barstow,

47:47.117 --> 47:48.327
I never been

Gisella, Lana, and Star.

those names before?

48:31.870 --> 48:33.205
I'll give you a hint.

48:33.830 --> 48:35.290
They're not fucking race horses.

48:35.415 --> 48:37.501
Kaiser, get this motherfucker
out of here.

48:37.668 --> 48:38.919
JIMMY:
Hold on, Kaiser.

48:39.545 --> 48:40.671
You ever met 'em?

48:40.754 --> 48:42.297
No, I can't say I have.

48:44.341 --> 48:45.217
You like jokes?

48:45.425 --> 48:46.593
Yeah, who don't like
a fucking joke.

48:46.677 --> 48:48.262
If this is a joke,
I don't find it funny.

48:48.345 --> 48:50.138
JIMMY: I'ma tell you--
I'ma tell you a joke.

48:51.682 --> 48:53.809
Three words to ruin a man's ego?

48:53.892 --> 48:54.768
"Is it in?"

48:54.852 --> 48:56.061
Now get the fuck out.

48:57.563 --> 48:58.856
You heard that one before.

48:58.939 --> 49:00.649
Yeah, I heard,
I'm the one who wrote it.

49:00.732 --> 49:02.818
'Cause this girl told it
to me the other night.

49:02.901 --> 49:04.027
PERSI:
What girl?

49:04.111 --> 49:06.154
Same girl
you said you never met.

49:06.238 --> 49:07.155
She heard it in my movie.

49:07.239 --> 49:09.116
I just told you,
David Cop-A-Feel. It's--

49:09.199 --> 49:12.077
Anybody who watches pornos,
watch-- knows the fucking line.

49:12.160 --> 49:13.036
It's famous.

49:13.120 --> 49:14.621
Now get the fuck out of here!

49:15.205 --> 49:16.498
Of course it is.

49:17.291 --> 49:18.458
Night, guys.

49:21.378 --> 49:22.546
Is that coke?

49:24.381 --> 49:25.716
And they're fucking passed out?

49:25.799 --> 49:27.467
PERSI:
Yeah, I got fucking coke.

49:27.926 --> 49:29.469
JIMMY:
Can I rip a line of blow?

49:29.636 --> 49:30.804
You get the fuck
out of my house,

49:30.888 --> 49:32.014
you can't have none!

49:33.682 --> 49:35.350
Oh to be you, huh.

49:36.977 --> 49:38.645
Small dick motherfucker.

49:49.865 --> 49:52.659
-You really a cop?
-No.

50:00.083 --> 50:02.878
I seen them here, those girls.

50:04.171 --> 50:05.964
Come with a sista I knows.

50:06.924 --> 50:08.425
Eleanor Rogers.

50:09.051 --> 50:12.262
She's one, uh,
20 feet from stardom types.

50:13.305 --> 50:14.681
Backup singer.

50:14.765 --> 50:16.099
Preacher's daughter.

50:19.394 --> 50:20.854
Why you telling me this?

50:22.189 --> 50:25.317
The fuck?
Motherfucker, I'm telling you.

50:26.193 --> 50:27.110
Leave it at that.

50:27.194 --> 50:28.570
Get the fuck outta here.

50:30.781 --> 50:31.990
Thanks.

50:36.078 --> 50:37.955
(Car engine rumbling)

50:48.465 --> 50:50.926
(♪♪♪)

51:30.799 --> 51:33.177
(Indistinct singing)

51:46.481 --> 51:49.067
(Humming)

51:58.619 --> 52:00.078
That was you singing, huh?

52:01.622 --> 52:02.873
Guilty.

52:05.501 --> 52:07.044
It's a recording studio?

52:13.425 --> 52:15.260
I'm looking for Miss Rogers.

52:15.761 --> 52:17.262
Miss Eleanor Rogers.

52:17.763 --> 52:18.889
Why?

52:20.265 --> 52:22.726
Our mutual friend Kaiser says
we should talk.

52:23.810 --> 52:24.811
About?

52:25.812 --> 52:27.564
About something
we're both involved in,

52:27.648 --> 52:28.565
we shouldn't be.

52:34.696 --> 52:36.657
I'll be at Shay's on 3rd, okay.

52:37.449 --> 52:38.742
Hey, you got a light?

52:40.077 --> 52:41.370
Yeah.

52:48.293 --> 52:49.503
Don't lose it.

52:50.546 --> 52:52.714
There's already enough
of those floating around.

53:00.347 --> 53:02.349
ELEANOR:
You don't mean Persi Muleeney?

53:02.432 --> 53:05.143
Nah, he ain't got it in him
to murder any girls like that.

53:05.227 --> 53:06.353
He ain't that slick.

53:07.354 --> 53:10.190
But he knows some fucking cats
doing some fucked up shit.

53:10.983 --> 53:12.109
What cats?

53:12.776 --> 53:14.570
He likes to strut
with a scary crowd

53:14.653 --> 53:16.113
with his tail all up in the air.

53:16.196 --> 53:18.031
But as much as he likes to be
on this gangsta shit,

53:18.115 --> 53:21.368
they just take his money
and laugh at his dumb white ass.

53:21.451 --> 53:22.703
Drug people?

53:22.786 --> 53:23.704
Fuck yeah.

53:24.371 --> 53:25.539
Cartel hookup.

53:25.622 --> 53:26.707
Why's someone like you
hanging out

53:26.790 --> 53:28.500
with someone shady like Persi?

53:29.168 --> 53:30.627
Someone like me?

53:32.754 --> 53:34.256
He told me
he'd put up all kinds of money

53:34.339 --> 53:36.049
to help me put out a solo album.

53:36.675 --> 53:37.843
And did he?

53:39.428 --> 53:40.512
No.

53:41.388 --> 53:43.307
Said if I could fuck like
I could sing...

53:45.893 --> 53:47.477
Well, I'm not even gonna
tell you the rest of that

53:47.561 --> 53:48.937
'cause I don't want
my father's ghost

53:49.021 --> 53:50.272
hearing that
come out of my mouth.

53:52.441 --> 53:54.193
Persi said
he never met the girls.

53:54.276 --> 53:56.528
Oh, honey, no, no, he lied.

53:57.279 --> 53:58.530
What else?

53:59.156 --> 54:02.159
Those girls, I mean,
oh my God,

54:02.993 --> 54:05.495
the way they were found
like that, I mean,

54:05.579 --> 54:07.414
that was somebody sending
a message.

54:07.497 --> 54:09.082
You said that wasn't
Persi's style.

54:09.208 --> 54:10.125
No, no.

54:10.209 --> 54:12.878
I think it was--
it was like those people

54:12.961 --> 54:14.588
I was talking about earlier,

54:14.671 --> 54:17.633
the ones that likes to use
Persi's house like it's theirs.

54:17.716 --> 54:18.967
"Scary crowd".

54:19.259 --> 54:20.928
Shit, you ain't heard this
from me.

54:21.512 --> 54:23.222
That scene is a blackhole.

54:23.847 --> 54:25.390
Girls come up missing
all the time,

54:25.474 --> 54:26.725
guys always trying
to take advantage

54:26.808 --> 54:27.851
of the situation.

54:28.977 --> 54:31.104
There was this one creeper
at a party one night.

54:31.188 --> 54:32.272
Late like 4:00 in the morning.

54:32.356 --> 54:33.440
Silver-haired dude.

54:33.524 --> 54:35.817
Now we were gonna go
to the patio and get high.

54:35.901 --> 54:38.403
Anyway, the silver-haired dude
was inside

54:38.487 --> 54:40.656
and I saw him talking to some
girls who had been there,

54:40.739 --> 54:43.825
I'd seen them a couple of times
and they were giving him money.

54:44.409 --> 54:45.911
About a week later,
I'm pulled over

54:45.994 --> 54:47.871
for not using my turn signal,
and it was him,

54:47.955 --> 54:49.081
the silver-haired dude.

54:49.164 --> 54:50.165
He's a fucking cop.

54:50.249 --> 54:52.334
-Is he a stocky guy?
-Yes, yeah.

54:52.417 --> 54:53.418
Uh, Flosso.

54:53.502 --> 54:55.003
Officer Flosso,
that was the name on the ticket.

54:55.087 --> 54:55.963
JIMMY:
Right, right.

54:56.046 --> 54:57.965
ELEANOR: The girl said
he was a cage fighter.

55:00.217 --> 55:03.762
Our friend Kaiser,
I need to talk to him again.

55:03.846 --> 55:04.888
Well, I'll give you his number,

55:04.972 --> 55:06.515
but, you know,
don't expect much.

55:06.598 --> 55:09.726
He's a moody motherfucker,
like you.

55:13.814 --> 55:16.942
Oh, one more thing,
and maybe it's nothing

55:17.025 --> 55:20.112
but the silver-haired guy,
I saw him take some money

55:20.195 --> 55:22.781
and then give it to this guy,
the "Doc".

55:22.865 --> 55:24.283
Well, we called him
"Dr. Feelgood",

55:24.366 --> 55:26.118
because, you know,
he was giving out

55:26.201 --> 55:28.078
pills like it was candy.

55:28.370 --> 55:31.290
Big beard
and the curly-ish hair,

55:31.373 --> 55:33.041
deep voice, like...

55:34.626 --> 55:37.171
I don't fucking know,
that also happened.

55:38.380 --> 55:39.840
I don't know if that helps.

55:41.049 --> 55:42.551
I wish I'd met you a week ago.

55:43.177 --> 55:46.013
Oh, what do you do?

55:46.763 --> 55:48.098
What do I do?

55:48.640 --> 55:49.725
Yeah?

55:50.058 --> 55:53.145
Um, uh, a lotta this, lately.

55:53.228 --> 55:56.064
No, when you're not creeping
on singers outside of studios.

55:56.148 --> 55:57.316
Did you say creeping?

55:57.399 --> 55:58.400
I--

55:59.443 --> 56:00.986
Um, what do I do?

56:01.320 --> 56:03.739
-I do uh, I do tattoos.
-Hmm.

56:03.822 --> 56:07.159
And uh... motors.

56:07.492 --> 56:09.203
-Hmm, rock 'n' roll life.
-Yeah.

56:09.286 --> 56:10.495
-Very cool.
-It's right.

56:10.579 --> 56:11.747
It's good people mostly.

56:11.830 --> 56:13.707
-Yeah.
-You got any ink?

56:13.790 --> 56:15.918
Oh man, no.

56:16.210 --> 56:18.587
I never found anything that
I wanted to stay with me

56:18.712 --> 56:19.588
for life, you know.

56:19.671 --> 56:20.756
Oh.

56:21.173 --> 56:23.592
Sometimes a tattoo
is just a tattoo.

56:23.675 --> 56:26.553
Okay, well then how come
most girls get a rose

56:26.637 --> 56:27.888
or a dolphin?

56:28.639 --> 56:30.390
Fucking angel wings.

56:30.474 --> 56:32.851
-How trashy is that?
-Touché.

56:32.935 --> 56:34.770
-It's so trashy, right.
-Touché.

56:34.853 --> 56:36.939
Yeah, well, you know
times are-- times are tough.

56:37.022 --> 56:38.106
Ink is ink.

56:38.190 --> 56:39.775
Oh, and that's when you do
those kind of tattoos.

56:39.858 --> 56:41.318
I draw the line at tramp stamps.

56:41.401 --> 56:43.195
-Oh.
-(Laughing)

56:44.071 --> 56:46.323
Well, it is good to know
there's a line.

56:46.406 --> 56:47.783
Yeah, there is.

56:48.242 --> 56:49.910
No, they all mean something.

56:52.287 --> 56:54.414
-It's not gonna run out on you.
-No.

56:54.498 --> 56:57.000
That's a different story,
probably a different tattoo.

57:00.504 --> 57:01.547
(Cellphone dings)

57:01.630 --> 57:04.174
Oh, I have to go.

57:04.591 --> 57:06.051
That is my 15.

57:06.385 --> 57:07.678
I've got an audition.

57:07.761 --> 57:08.804
Mm?

57:08.887 --> 57:10.556
Uh I hope that this helped.

57:11.473 --> 57:13.141
Changed my day around.

57:13.225 --> 57:14.768
Oh, fine.

57:15.227 --> 57:16.562
Maybe I'll see you around.

57:16.645 --> 57:18.438
-Good luck on your audition.
-Thank you.

57:18.522 --> 57:19.731
You're welcome.

57:29.950 --> 57:33.036
(♪♪♪)

58:09.615 --> 58:12.117
Meet me behind the station.
I have something to show you.

58:18.916 --> 58:20.918
(Snorting)

58:27.925 --> 58:29.760
(Cellphone ringing)

58:31.386 --> 58:32.679
(Coughs)

58:34.765 --> 58:35.849
Yo.

58:36.558 --> 58:38.685
Yeah, we've-- we've been
shooting all night.

58:39.019 --> 58:41.063
Jayne busted into my party
the other night,

58:41.522 --> 58:43.690
asking me about Star
and the others.

58:44.024 --> 58:45.025
Nah, I didn't tell him shit.

58:45.108 --> 58:46.735
The asshole ruined my high.

58:48.111 --> 58:49.655
You gotta be cool, bro.

58:51.406 --> 58:52.783
There's some girls here.

58:53.534 --> 58:56.078
(Snorts, coughs)
(Knocking on door)

58:56.161 --> 58:58.664
Yeah, I still got 'em ,
come on up.

58:59.039 --> 58:59.915
Okay, cool.

58:59.998 --> 59:01.500
(Knocking on door)

59:04.044 --> 59:06.255
Hey, yo, what--
what are you doing here?

59:06.672 --> 59:08.715
You don't-- you can't just come
over to my office like this.

59:09.383 --> 59:11.844
(♪♪♪)

59:15.514 --> 59:19.017
(Grunting, moaning in distance)

59:32.114 --> 59:34.449
ERASMUS: Looking for Persi?
All the way down to the left.

59:35.784 --> 59:38.412
(indistinct speech)

59:48.797 --> 59:50.048
Bye, Juicy.

59:50.382 --> 59:52.676
(♪♪♪)

1:00:02.394 --> 1:00:03.604
(Screams)

1:00:03.937 --> 1:00:06.315
(♪♪♪)

1:00:25.709 --> 1:00:26.752
Hey.

1:00:28.212 --> 1:00:29.213
FREEMAN:
What is it, Jimmy?

1:00:29.296 --> 1:00:30.714
You're gonna wanna see this.

1:00:30.797 --> 1:00:31.840
FREEMAN:
What?

1:00:31.924 --> 1:00:34.426
You need to move your car
before we get it towed.

1:00:34.510 --> 1:00:35.928
Yeah, I could move it.

1:00:36.762 --> 1:00:38.555
I could drive it
right to the morgue.

1:00:39.056 --> 1:00:40.307
What are you talking about?

1:00:47.314 --> 1:00:48.690
Who's pulling the strings?

1:00:50.067 --> 1:00:51.652
Who could throw the body
of a giant in a trunk

1:00:51.735 --> 1:00:53.070
without nobody seeing?

1:00:54.154 --> 1:00:55.489
Whoever did it,
picked the locks

1:00:55.572 --> 1:00:57.908
in the parking lot on Franklin
where they threw the body.

1:00:58.617 --> 1:01:00.244
In broad daylight?

1:01:01.328 --> 1:01:02.371
They did it sometime
in the morning

1:01:02.454 --> 1:01:03.872
while I was having breakfast.

1:01:03.997 --> 1:01:05.290
You've been tracking my cell,

1:01:05.374 --> 1:01:07.292
you know
I couldn't have done this.

1:01:07.626 --> 1:01:09.044
VARGAS:
I don't know, buddy.

1:01:09.127 --> 1:01:13.048
I think somebody's seriously
fucking with you, big time.

1:01:13.799 --> 1:01:15.050
Or warning me.

1:01:16.134 --> 1:01:18.095
Maybe they knew Kaiser
was trying to help me.

1:01:18.178 --> 1:01:19.304
Yeah.

1:01:19.388 --> 1:01:21.098
Now don't you think
the smart thing to do

1:01:21.181 --> 1:01:22.391
would have been to tell us

1:01:22.474 --> 1:01:25.143
about this when the Land Rover
first tried to run you down?

1:01:26.645 --> 1:01:28.981
I've never been accused
of being smart.

1:01:29.064 --> 1:01:29.940
Right.

1:01:30.148 --> 1:01:33.819
What about your visit
to Persi's party?

1:01:33.902 --> 1:01:35.404
Persi had nothing to do with it.

1:01:35.988 --> 1:01:37.447
He's just a bad host.

1:01:37.531 --> 1:01:38.615
If I were you,
I would check the people

1:01:38.699 --> 1:01:40.617
at the Chateau party,
that's where I'd start.

1:01:41.952 --> 1:01:45.205
Sorry, buddy,
afraid we have to keep the car.

1:01:47.958 --> 1:01:50.335
Okay. Well, don't scratch it.

1:01:50.502 --> 1:01:51.712
Don't fuck with the radio.

1:01:51.795 --> 1:01:54.590
No scratch, no problem.

1:01:55.174 --> 1:01:56.508
Who's driving me home?

1:01:57.259 --> 1:01:58.719
I'll drive you home.

1:02:09.980 --> 1:02:12.482
Hey, no smoking in the cruiser.

1:02:13.233 --> 1:02:14.735
It's regulations.

1:02:14.818 --> 1:02:16.236
All right,
have a couple of puffs,

1:02:16.320 --> 1:02:17.362
I'll wait.

1:02:23.452 --> 1:02:25.078
What a fucking day, man.

1:02:25.579 --> 1:02:27.372
Yeah, me too.

1:02:28.498 --> 1:02:29.917
Persi's dead.

1:02:30.584 --> 1:02:32.920
Yeah, I know,
a real loss to humanity.

1:02:33.962 --> 1:02:35.047
How'd he go?

1:02:35.422 --> 1:02:36.757
VARGAS:
Snapped neck.

1:02:37.758 --> 1:02:41.345
Now look, I'm only gonna
tell you this once,

1:02:41.678 --> 1:02:43.639
I don't think you're involved
in this

1:02:43.722 --> 1:02:46.141
any more than somebody
wants you to be.

1:02:46.225 --> 1:02:47.267
Okay.

1:02:49.853 --> 1:02:51.313
I'm next.

1:02:52.439 --> 1:02:53.899
I think you're right.

1:02:54.233 --> 1:02:55.400
JIMMY:
How's that?

1:02:56.527 --> 1:02:59.363
You know something
you don't even know you know.

1:02:59.446 --> 1:03:03.492
Or somebody wants you to know
something, you know.

1:03:05.619 --> 1:03:06.787
Let's hit it.

1:03:06.912 --> 1:03:08.121
Put that out.

1:03:11.667 --> 1:03:13.001
(Vargas grunts)

1:03:33.188 --> 1:03:34.982
(Birds chirping)

1:03:44.366 --> 1:03:45.951
So this how you live?

1:03:48.620 --> 1:03:51.164
Yeah,
Dad left me the house.

1:03:52.291 --> 1:03:56.503
Mortgaged to get the shop,
couldn't make the payment, closed,

1:03:57.212 --> 1:03:59.590
told the family moving in that this
is a separate property.

1:04:00.382 --> 1:04:02.968
So what, they can kick you out
anytime they want?

1:04:05.596 --> 1:04:07.055
I don't know, James.

1:04:09.141 --> 1:04:11.143
All right, concerned citizen,

1:04:12.394 --> 1:04:15.439
why don't you tell me
who you think's involved?

1:04:15.731 --> 1:04:16.690
Flosso.

1:04:17.232 --> 1:04:18.400
Flosso?

1:04:19.109 --> 1:04:20.527
JIMMY:
He's an ex-fighter.

1:04:20.611 --> 1:04:21.486
Huh.

1:04:21.653 --> 1:04:24.198
He'd certainly know how to
break their necks clean enough.

1:04:24.281 --> 1:04:26.658
So this preacher's daughter,
your source,

1:04:26.742 --> 1:04:28.243
she for certain it was him?

1:04:28.994 --> 1:04:31.496
Yeah,
he's working for somebody.

1:04:32.122 --> 1:04:33.665
Well, that makes sense,
'cause Flosso,

1:04:33.749 --> 1:04:35.334
he's a real dumb shit.

1:04:35.417 --> 1:04:37.419
He wouldn't be able to do it
on his own.

1:04:37.711 --> 1:04:40.297
I'll look him up,
I'll see what I can find.

1:04:42.674 --> 1:04:44.635
Hey Vargas,
how well you know your partner?

1:04:46.094 --> 1:04:47.304
Why you ask?

1:04:48.931 --> 1:04:50.349
'Cause I think he's dirty.

1:04:52.142 --> 1:04:54.770
I think he found my lighter
and thought I was an easy mark.

1:04:55.646 --> 1:04:57.397
You're reaching, buddy.

1:04:57.731 --> 1:05:00.150
And you better be careful
what you're saying.

1:05:00.984 --> 1:05:02.402
He have an alibi?

1:05:02.653 --> 1:05:04.696
Matter of fact he does.

1:05:04.780 --> 1:05:07.574
He was half in the bag
over at the Montello.

1:05:07.783 --> 1:05:09.159
How're the cameras at the
Montello Lounge?

1:05:09.243 --> 1:05:10.285
-They're good.
-Yeah?

1:05:10.369 --> 1:05:11.453
Yeah.

1:05:12.037 --> 1:05:14.331
If you check the video footage
and you see him

1:05:14.414 --> 1:05:16.667
leaving between 2:00 and 2:30,
then I was right.

1:05:17.417 --> 1:05:20.629
And if I'm right,
I just wanna know about it.

1:05:20.712 --> 1:05:23.173
No. All right,
no more cowboy shit.

1:05:23.632 --> 1:05:25.801
I'll take a look at the tapes,
but I can already tell you

1:05:25.884 --> 1:05:27.636
what I'm gonna find, okay.

1:05:27.719 --> 1:05:30.722
And by the way,
you're all wrong about Freeman.

1:05:31.431 --> 1:05:34.142
He's a good guy,
he's my kid's godfather.

1:05:37.062 --> 1:05:38.397
Hitler loved dogs.

1:05:39.022 --> 1:05:39.898
Huh.

1:05:39.982 --> 1:05:41.233
What's your point?

1:05:42.317 --> 1:05:44.111
My point is
some of the most evil people

1:05:44.236 --> 1:05:46.238
in the world
still have great smiles.

1:05:47.781 --> 1:05:48.782
That's interesting.

1:05:49.199 --> 1:05:50.659
Just do me a favor.

1:05:50.742 --> 1:05:52.369
Stand down, all right.

1:05:52.452 --> 1:05:54.496
You done enough, okay?

1:05:57.916 --> 1:05:59.042
It's depressing.

1:06:02.546 --> 1:06:04.923
(♪♪♪)

1:06:21.607 --> 1:06:22.858
JIMMY:
What's your name?

1:06:26.403 --> 1:06:27.654
STAR:
Star.

1:06:31.742 --> 1:06:35.120
If you forget, just look up.

1:06:37.331 --> 1:06:40.125
(♪♪♪)

1:07:02.689 --> 1:07:03.815
(Sighs)

1:07:09.363 --> 1:07:11.198
(Bike engine rumbling)

1:07:14.576 --> 1:07:16.036
The shit's vegan, right?

1:07:16.119 --> 1:07:18.288
Makeup? It's vegan?

1:07:18.580 --> 1:07:19.498
Go check.

1:07:19.581 --> 1:07:21.667
It's in my contract,
vegan makeup!

1:07:22.376 --> 1:07:24.878
(♪♪♪)

1:07:41.687 --> 1:07:43.856
Don't fucking say anything,
I'm mic'd.

1:07:47.401 --> 1:07:49.570
Okay, you know
what it looks like-- I'm fr--

1:07:49.653 --> 1:07:51.071
Shut the fuck up!

1:07:51.238 --> 1:07:52.364
Shut up!

1:07:54.825 --> 1:07:56.159
You lied to me.

1:07:57.077 --> 1:07:58.871
You lie to me again,
I'll break your fucking face,

1:07:58.954 --> 1:08:00.122
you understand?

1:08:00.497 --> 1:08:01.874
-You understand?
-Yeah.

1:08:01.957 --> 1:08:03.083
-Yeah?
-Okay.

1:08:08.922 --> 1:08:10.340
Tell me about Persi.

1:08:10.757 --> 1:08:11.717
Fuck, man.

1:08:11.800 --> 1:08:13.886
I was embarrassed to admit
that I was hanging with Persi

1:08:13.969 --> 1:08:16.054
'cause he is a fucking scumbag,
okay.

1:08:16.138 --> 1:08:18.098
But it's not illegal to drink
his booze and eat his food,

1:08:18.182 --> 1:08:21.185
not to mention, fucking pussy
flying around that place.

1:08:21.268 --> 1:08:23.020
I mean, anything goes there.

1:08:23.770 --> 1:08:24.854
Like what?

1:08:25.898 --> 1:08:28.317
Some local cops there
hanging out now,

1:08:28.399 --> 1:08:30.027
playing poker in the back.

1:08:31.862 --> 1:08:34.156
That's not all that's going on
back there.

1:08:34.238 --> 1:08:36.116
Yeah, I heard a few pimped
some girls,

1:08:36.200 --> 1:08:37.868
but that's none
of my fucking business.

1:08:37.951 --> 1:08:39.953
I had nothing to do
with those dead hookers.

1:08:41.580 --> 1:08:43.832
Star and her friends,
did they go to this party?

1:08:43.916 --> 1:08:46.376
Yeah, man, I said that,
I seen them there a few times

1:08:46.460 --> 1:08:48.545
but there's 50 fucking girls
there every night.

1:08:48.629 --> 1:08:50.881
You wanna talk to someone?
Talk to Erasmus.

1:08:51.131 --> 1:08:52.883
Am I supposed to know
who that is?

1:08:52.966 --> 1:08:54.510
Erasmus Alcindor.
He's a screenwriter.

1:08:54.593 --> 1:08:57.304
He's a fucking hack,
looks like a ferret.

1:08:57.763 --> 1:08:59.430
He used to date Star.

1:08:59.932 --> 1:09:01.433
Look, I don't know
why they dated either,

1:09:01.517 --> 1:09:02.975
she's a fucking beautiful girl
messing around

1:09:03.060 --> 1:09:04.770
with some fucking creep.

1:09:05.103 --> 1:09:07.104
He used to lie to her
and say he'd put her in movies.

1:09:08.857 --> 1:09:11.734
He talks to that cop Flosso,
all the time.

1:09:13.946 --> 1:09:15.238
Where can I find him?

1:09:16.113 --> 1:09:17.282
Erasmus?

1:09:17.908 --> 1:09:20.452
He lives in those shithole apartments
in Persi's studios.

1:09:21.036 --> 1:09:22.621
I swear to fucking God, man.

1:09:22.828 --> 1:09:24.790
Fuck God,
I swear to you, okay?

1:09:24.872 --> 1:09:26.792
He knows everything about
their operation.

1:09:26.875 --> 1:09:27.876
Everything.

1:09:32.631 --> 1:09:34.925
I swear to you,
I swear, I swear, I--

1:09:35.008 --> 1:09:37.511
Listen, listen,
you little bitch.

1:09:37.803 --> 1:09:39.930
-You gonna lie to me again?
-No.

1:09:40.013 --> 1:09:42.099
-You gonna lie to me again?
-No, I'm not gonna lie again!

1:09:42.182 --> 1:09:43.140
No!

1:09:43.684 --> 1:09:46.144
(♪♪♪)

1:10:30.439 --> 1:10:31.565
Erasmus?

1:10:51.793 --> 1:10:52.920
Go away!

1:10:53.295 --> 1:10:54.379
Erasmus?

1:10:54.463 --> 1:10:56.340
Are you fucking deaf?
He's not here.

1:11:03.889 --> 1:11:05.807
This can go one of two ways.

1:11:05.891 --> 1:11:08.352
You watch who you're throwing insults
out of your word-hole to,

1:11:08.435 --> 1:11:10.229
you-- you--
the wrong person hears it,

1:11:10.521 --> 1:11:12.773
and you'll be in a fucking
cheap hotel room dead,

1:11:12.856 --> 1:11:13.941
you hear me?

1:11:15.484 --> 1:11:16.568
(Grunts)

1:11:17.528 --> 1:11:18.737
ERASMUS:
Fuck, man.

1:11:19.071 --> 1:11:19.988
I'm a pacifist!

1:11:20.280 --> 1:11:21.657
I'm a pacifist!

1:11:22.157 --> 1:11:23.283
Fuck.

1:11:23.367 --> 1:11:24.284
I'm not.

1:11:26.453 --> 1:11:27.746
You going somewhere?

1:11:27.829 --> 1:11:28.705
Babylon has fallen,

1:11:28.789 --> 1:11:30.624
can't you see
it's the last days of Rome?

1:11:36.046 --> 1:11:37.506
You want to know what I see?

1:11:39.591 --> 1:11:42.886
I see a piece of shit
who's in way over his head

1:11:43.053 --> 1:11:44.304
who's gonna tell me
all about his girlfriend.

1:11:44.638 --> 1:11:45.931
Which one?

1:11:46.139 --> 1:11:47.641
You know which one.

1:11:47.724 --> 1:11:48.934
Fucking Star.

1:11:49.017 --> 1:11:50.811
Star's not my girlfriend,
you sperm-less testicle,

1:11:50.894 --> 1:11:52.145
she's my friend.

1:11:52.479 --> 1:11:54.731
Alright, women, I'm not a threat
to them, they trust me,

1:11:54.815 --> 1:11:56.483
they bare
their midnight fantasies,

1:11:56.567 --> 1:11:57.734
their hopes and dreams.

1:11:58.819 --> 1:12:00.112
(Grunts in pain)

1:12:00.779 --> 1:12:05.492
Alright, I'm telling you
that she was an angel! Star.

1:12:05.784 --> 1:12:07.786
They should've called her
"The-Whole-fucking-Galaxy".

1:12:07.870 --> 1:12:08.787
Who killed her?

1:12:08.871 --> 1:12:10.831
It's not that simple, man.

1:12:10.914 --> 1:12:12.124
She was--
it's not that simple.

1:12:12.207 --> 1:12:14.418
She was blackmailing us--
them, them!

1:12:14.501 --> 1:12:16.086
That's not an admission
of guilt.

1:12:16.170 --> 1:12:18.422
-She was blackmailing them.
-Who?

1:12:18.505 --> 1:12:20.174
I tried to stop her,
but she brought the others

1:12:20.257 --> 1:12:21.258
-in on it.
-Who?

1:12:21.341 --> 1:12:22.843
All the girls, man.

1:12:23.218 --> 1:12:25.637
Persi used to run drugs
up from Mexico.

1:12:25.721 --> 1:12:27.764
He had to find a way
to launder the money,

1:12:27.848 --> 1:12:28.932
so he got in the film business

1:12:29.016 --> 1:12:30.642
and then he started
trafficking girls,

1:12:30.726 --> 1:12:32.352
all the girls
who wanna be in his movies.

1:12:32.519 --> 1:12:34.479
Didn't ask for a fucking resume.

1:12:34.563 --> 1:12:36.398
Tell me who killed Star.

1:12:36.940 --> 1:12:38.692
ERASMUS:
Flosso, man.

1:12:39.026 --> 1:12:41.737
They always used Flosso to keep
the girls in line.

1:12:41.820 --> 1:12:43.030
Don't fucking lie to me.

1:12:43.113 --> 1:12:44.740
-(Indistinct speech)
-Don't fucking lie to me.

1:12:44.823 --> 1:12:47.201
Half the fucking precinct
is in it, man.

1:12:47.284 --> 1:12:49.161
How you think they wear
such nice suits?

1:12:49.244 --> 1:12:50.287
I want names.

1:12:50.370 --> 1:12:52.915
Goddammit, Flosso is a name!

1:12:52.998 --> 1:12:54.374
Flosso is a name.

1:13:00.797 --> 1:13:02.174
Who ordered the hit?

1:13:03.300 --> 1:13:04.301
Who ordered the hit!

1:13:04.384 --> 1:13:05.636
He'll kill me.

1:13:05.719 --> 1:13:07.137
I'll fucking kill you.

1:13:07.221 --> 1:13:08.722
Who ordered the hit?

1:13:09.097 --> 1:13:10.349
ERASMUS:
Freeman.

1:13:10.641 --> 1:13:13.018
-Detective--
-Don't fucking lie to me, man.

1:13:15.354 --> 1:13:17.523
ERASMUS:
I'm telling the truth, man.

1:13:17.606 --> 1:13:19.525
I overheard him
and Persi talking.

1:13:21.652 --> 1:13:24.404
It's-- it's not killing women
to them, man.

1:13:24.488 --> 1:13:26.949
It's more like clearing out
rotten inventory.

1:13:27.032 --> 1:13:29.993
Like difficult women
make bad hookers, man.

1:13:30.327 --> 1:13:33.372
And you were--
you were the perfect fall guy.

1:13:33.455 --> 1:13:34.748
You screwed everything up,
man.

1:13:34.831 --> 1:13:37.584
Now Flosso's in the wind
and they want us all dead.

1:13:39.336 --> 1:13:40.629
How are you involved?

1:13:41.213 --> 1:13:43.549
Me, I'm just a writer, man.

1:13:43.632 --> 1:13:44.675
I schedule the girls.

1:13:44.758 --> 1:13:46.635
I make sure
they have a good time.

1:13:46.718 --> 1:13:48.887
I take care of the girls,
that's it.

1:13:49.137 --> 1:13:50.305
And Vargas?

1:13:50.931 --> 1:13:52.307
You seen him around?

1:13:52.391 --> 1:13:54.393
Freeman keeps him in the dark,
man.

1:13:54.476 --> 1:13:56.520
Vargas is the worst detective
in the city.

1:13:57.229 --> 1:13:58.730
(Cellphone ringing)

1:13:58.856 --> 1:13:59.773
I'm going to my mom's.

1:13:59.857 --> 1:14:01.149
I should have never left
Glendale.

1:14:03.986 --> 1:14:05.028
Yeah.

1:14:06.572 --> 1:14:07.656
Just pulled up.

1:14:08.532 --> 1:14:09.783
What are you talking about?

1:14:10.868 --> 1:14:12.244
To the parlor.

1:14:13.370 --> 1:14:16.123
Rent here on Melrose
must be outrageous.

1:14:16.790 --> 1:14:18.000
Wait, what?

1:14:19.084 --> 1:14:20.919
Jimmy, you just texted me
15 minutes ago

1:14:21.003 --> 1:14:22.838
-saying to meet you here.
-No. No, hey run.

1:14:23.005 --> 1:14:23.922
Get out of there.

1:14:24.006 --> 1:14:25.007
Get the fuck out of there.

1:14:25.174 --> 1:14:26.633
(grunting)

1:14:26.842 --> 1:14:28.510
JIMMY ON PHONE:
Hey? Hey!

1:14:37.394 --> 1:14:39.229
(Cellphone ringing)

1:14:40.731 --> 1:14:42.524
-JIMMY ON PHONE: Vargas?
-Hey, where are you, Jimmy?

1:14:42.774 --> 1:14:45.068
Freeman's mixed
into this for sure.

1:14:45.152 --> 1:14:46.153
Yeah, fuck, I know that.

1:14:46.236 --> 1:14:48.280
Look,
I just went to The Montello.

1:14:48.488 --> 1:14:50.699
They already handed over
their tapes to guess who?

1:14:50.782 --> 1:14:51.742
Yeah.

1:14:51.825 --> 1:14:54.411
So listen, Star, she worked
the concession stand

1:14:54.494 --> 1:14:55.787
at this old movie theatre.

1:14:55.871 --> 1:14:58.415
She sent an encrypted file
to her boss.

1:14:58.832 --> 1:15:01.335
Forensics, they're trying
to unlock it right now, okay.

1:15:01.418 --> 1:15:04.087
Hey, that source
I told you about,

1:15:04.171 --> 1:15:05.506
the preacher's daughter,

1:15:05.881 --> 1:15:08.008
she somehow got a text
from my phone.

1:15:08.300 --> 1:15:10.135
I was talking to her
when she was abducted.

1:15:10.219 --> 1:15:12.471
Hold on, okay.
We're gonna get an APB out.

1:15:12.638 --> 1:15:15.641
Also a bystander ID'd Flosso
leaving the scene

1:15:15.724 --> 1:15:17.726
where Star and her friends
were found.

1:15:17.809 --> 1:15:19.019
You understand that?

1:15:19.645 --> 1:15:21.522
You speak to your captain
about the tapes?

1:15:21.605 --> 1:15:23.273
Look, I haven't talked
to anybody yet.

1:15:23.357 --> 1:15:24.525
Where was she?

1:15:24.608 --> 1:15:25.943
She's right outside my shop.

1:15:26.026 --> 1:15:27.027
Okay, listen,

1:15:27.152 --> 1:15:28.403
I'm gonna roll units over
right now.

1:15:28.487 --> 1:15:29.780
Do not go inside, Jimmy.

1:15:29.863 --> 1:15:31.532
-You hear me?
-Oh no.

1:15:31.615 --> 1:15:32.950
Do not engage.

1:15:33.033 --> 1:15:34.076
Okay.

1:15:35.911 --> 1:15:37.037
Okay.

VARGAS ON PHONE:

1:20:36.587 --> 1:20:37.462
You alone?

1:20:37.546 --> 1:20:39.173
-Yeah, what's going on?
-All right.

1:20:39.256 --> 1:20:40.924
It's Freeman,
gotta bring him in.

1:20:41.508 --> 1:20:42.593
He's dirty.

1:20:42.843 --> 1:20:43.760
Just busted Flosso.

1:20:43.927 --> 1:20:45.596
He was trying to kill a witness.

1:20:45.888 --> 1:20:46.847
Got it?

1:20:46.930 --> 1:20:48.265
Fuck, he just left.

1:20:59.484 --> 1:21:00.527

What's your hurry, Bill?

1:21:23.759 --> 1:21:25.219
(Gun blares)

1:21:31.558 --> 1:21:32.643
So stupid.

1:21:32.768 --> 1:21:34.019
(Gun blares)

1:21:51.328 --> 1:21:52.579
Where they take her?

1:21:53.747 --> 1:21:55.040
FLOSSO:
I don't know.

1:21:56.458 --> 1:21:57.960
I could drive this thing
into the Pacific,

1:21:58.043 --> 1:21:59.962
or you can give me an
exact address.

1:22:09.221 --> 1:22:10.848
You're gonna die anyways.

1:22:12.224 --> 1:22:15.435
Now you can lie to me,
I can make it real slow,

1:22:17.020 --> 1:22:19.731
or you can tell me the truth
and maybe I'll make it fast.

1:22:20.524 --> 1:22:21.692
Maybe.

1:22:23.485 --> 1:22:25.404
I didn't want any of this.

1:22:25.988 --> 1:22:27.281
It was Freeman.

1:22:28.115 --> 1:22:30.492
Fucking Freeman caught me
with a gram.

1:22:30.617 --> 1:22:32.369
One gram.

1:22:34.746 --> 1:22:36.665
Told me he'd get IA
to take my badge away

1:22:36.748 --> 1:22:39.585
and put me away for three years
if I didn't work for him.

1:22:43.839 --> 1:22:45.340
You killed Star?

1:22:47.634 --> 1:22:48.969
Yeah, I did.

1:22:53.056 --> 1:22:54.266
Where's Eleanor?

1:22:57.269 --> 1:22:58.562
San Diego.

1:22:59.897 --> 1:23:04.443
They got a restaurant,
a fridge leads to a tunnel.

1:23:06.195 --> 1:23:07.613
JIMMY:
What's this tunnel?

1:23:09.948 --> 1:23:14.786
The kind of tunnel that connects
San Diego with Tijuana.

1:23:16.914 --> 1:23:18.415
Freeman runnin' the operation?

1:23:18.498 --> 1:23:19.666
FLOSSO:
Fuck no.

1:23:20.083 --> 1:23:23.253
It's some broker, Dr. Feelgood.

1:23:24.838 --> 1:23:26.465
He's a dangerous cat
though, man.

1:23:26.590 --> 1:23:28.008
He's got eyes everywhere.

1:23:30.385 --> 1:23:31.678
-Hey.
-Hmm.

1:23:32.054 --> 1:23:34.264
I tell you where they are,
I'll take you to 'em,

1:23:35.599 --> 1:23:37.142
you gotta let me go.

1:23:38.477 --> 1:23:40.145
It's a fair trade, right?

1:23:43.023 --> 1:23:44.107
Yeah.

1:23:45.317 --> 1:23:46.318
Yeah.

1:24:54.970 --> 1:24:56.555

I do not work to your schedule,
detective.

1:25:00.058 --> 1:25:01.351
Where's Flosso?

1:25:01.727 --> 1:25:05.230
As soon as we get safe,
he's next.

1:25:05.480 --> 1:25:07.900
She's doped up
and ready for transport.

1:25:08.734 --> 1:25:12.321
Buyers pay well
for American girls, age aside.

1:25:12.571 --> 1:25:14.615
Just make sure I get my cut.

1:25:25.250 --> 1:25:27.669

I have an idea.

1:33:48.670 --> 1:33:49.796
Oh?

The theatre manager was such
a nice guy.

1:33:54.760 --> 1:33:56.678
Not like my new bosses.

1:33:56.762 --> 1:34:01.141

how do you say... pigs.

1:34:56.780 --> 1:34:58.407
I don't know about that.

1:34:59.032 --> 1:35:00.075
Persi wants us.

1:35:00.158 --> 1:35:01.326
He has a car outside already.

1:35:01.410 --> 1:35:02.369
Yeah.

1:35:03.912 --> 1:35:06.665
Hey, what's your name?

1:35:08.125 --> 1:35:09.251
Star.

1:35:09.626 --> 1:35:11.753
If you forget, just look up.

1:35:16.508 --> 1:35:19.553
Hey. Bye Star.

1:35:22.598 --> 1:35:25.267
(Indistinct chatter
in background)

1:35:29.271 --> 1:35:30.397
Star...

1:35:36.570 --> 1:35:37.696
(Sighs)

1:35:38.155 --> 1:35:39.406
Thank you.

1:35:41.408 --> 1:35:44.286
(♪♪♪)
