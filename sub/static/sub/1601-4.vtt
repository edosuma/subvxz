WEBVTT

00:00.200 --> 00:02.158
Previously on Bates Motel... 

00:02.232 --> 00:03.566
You're one of the most interesting people

00:03.566 --> 00:05.877
I've met in this town, and I cannot wait

00:05.924 --> 00:07.118
to introduce you around.

00:07.163 --> 00:08.463
Does she try to set you up often?

00:08.531 --> 00:10.098
Uh, no.

00:10.166 --> 00:12.801
Never, actually, which
says something about you.

00:12.902 --> 00:14.603
Hey, I'm looking for Norma Bates.

00:14.704 --> 00:16.572
- Who are you?
- I'm her brother.

00:16.639 --> 00:18.373
My brother Caleb was here.

00:18.474 --> 00:20.242
Just out of nowhere... he just showed up.

00:20.343 --> 00:22.211
- What did he want?
- I've thought about this moment

00:22.278 --> 00:24.479
so many times, but now that
I'm actually looking at you... 

00:24.547 --> 00:25.948
You have to leave.

00:26.015 --> 00:27.282
Why is she so mad at you anyways?

00:27.383 --> 00:28.750
Ah, you know how families are.

00:28.818 --> 00:30.619
Things that happened years and years ago,

00:30.720 --> 00:32.186
it's like they're yesterday.

00:32.287 --> 00:33.522
I never met this man before yesterday,

00:33.623 --> 00:35.157
never even knew that I had an uncle.

00:35.258 --> 00:36.592
But already he's been nicer to me

00:36.659 --> 00:38.026
then you've ever been, told me more

00:38.094 --> 00:39.494
- than you ever have.
- He raped me, Dylan!

00:39.562 --> 00:40.829
He didn't rape you!

00:40.930 --> 00:42.264
You weren't there. You don't know.

00:42.365 --> 00:45.133
You're a liar!

00:45.201 --> 00:47.636
Get away from her.

00:47.737 --> 00:49.404
Stop it. He can't help it.

00:49.472 --> 00:51.139
It's his dad.

00:51.207 --> 00:53.842
Caleb is his dad.

01:17.367 --> 01:20.235
No.

01:24.674 --> 01:26.275
Excuse me?

01:26.376 --> 01:28.076
It's fine. This happens all the time.

01:28.144 --> 01:29.211
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

01:29.312 --> 01:31.613
Is there a manager around?

01:31.681 --> 01:34.349
A man's passed out in that
truck right over there,

01:34.417 --> 01:36.151
where anyone can see him.

01:38.688 --> 01:42.658
Okay. Don't do that.

01:52.969 --> 01:55.304
Dylan.

01:55.405 --> 01:58.507
Dylan!

01:58.608 --> 02:00.709
Um... 

02:02.812 --> 02:05.280
Oh, no. Okay.

02:05.348 --> 02:06.982
Back in.

02:12.322 --> 02:15.223
Norman. Norman.

02:15.325 --> 02:18.360
Norman, wake up.

02:18.428 --> 02:21.396
Emma.

02:21.497 --> 02:22.864
What's wrong?

02:22.966 --> 02:25.734
It's Dylan. He's in bad shape.

02:25.802 --> 02:28.070
He slept in his truck and didn't wake up.

02:28.171 --> 02:32.774
I think he was seriously drunk.

02:32.875 --> 02:35.210
Do you want me to go get your mom?

02:35.278 --> 02:37.245
No. No. No, she, uh... 

02:37.347 --> 02:39.514
She had a tough night.

02:39.615 --> 02:41.216
I can help him.

02:41.284 --> 02:44.419
- Just let me get dressed.
- Oh, sorry.

02:50.793 --> 02:52.594
Oh, no! No, no, no.

02:52.662 --> 02:55.897
Sorry.

02:55.999 --> 02:58.300
Get his boots off. I'll get some water.

02:58.401 --> 03:01.603
He should drink water.

03:01.704 --> 03:03.538
Do you think it's alcohol poisoning?

03:03.639 --> 03:05.240
I don't know.

03:05.308 --> 03:07.676
I've never seen him like this.

03:07.744 --> 03:10.545
Did something happen to him?

03:10.646 --> 03:12.681
Did someone break up with
him? Did he get fired?

03:12.749 --> 03:16.218
- Did he have a fight with some... 
- I don't know!

03:22.592 --> 03:24.993
What happened?

03:25.094 --> 03:28.764
Emma found him passed out in his truck.

03:28.865 --> 03:30.966
I guess he's been drinking.

03:31.034 --> 03:33.101
A lot.

03:45.848 --> 03:49.651
You guys go back out and
watch the office, please.

04:59.463 --> 05:03.766
Maybe someone should
probably stay with him.

05:03.834 --> 05:05.735
Why are you here?

05:05.836 --> 05:07.003
I work here.

05:07.104 --> 05:09.272
But it's 7:00 in the morning.

05:09.373 --> 05:11.374
Weekends have been so busy,

05:11.475 --> 05:13.743
and I just wanted to come
in, you know, to help out.

05:13.844 --> 05:16.479
- Okay, thank you.
- But is everything okay?

05:16.580 --> 05:19.382
Yeah. Everything's fine.

05:20.718 --> 05:23.386
Mother.

05:23.487 --> 05:26.923
- What?
- Should we do something?

05:27.024 --> 05:28.624
Like what, Norman?

05:28.726 --> 05:31.794
- I don't know.
- There is one thing I can do.

05:31.862 --> 05:32.995
What? Wait. Wait a minute.

05:33.097 --> 05:34.530
Wait. Where are you going?

05:34.631 --> 05:35.998
I'll come with you.

05:36.100 --> 05:38.401
Norman, just stay here.
Stay with your brother.

05:38.502 --> 05:41.404
I mean it. This is mine to do, not yours.

06:43.936 --> 06:46.976
- Sync and corrections by madhatters -
- www.addic7ed.com -

06:48.705 --> 06:49.906
I'm asking for an extra half hour... 

06:50.007 --> 06:51.374
Checkout is at 11:00, Mr. Woodbury,

06:51.441 --> 06:53.910
and we do have someone
coming in today, so... 

06:54.011 --> 06:56.746
I get that, I just don't
understand what the big deal is.

06:58.282 --> 06:59.515
I'd even pay you a little
bit extra if I have to.

06:59.616 --> 07:00.750
You know what? Whenever's fine.

07:00.818 --> 07:04.453
- Just check out whenever.
- Yeah, all right.

07:24.308 --> 07:28.177
I thought you might be hungry.

07:28.278 --> 07:31.214
And here's a clean shirt if you want it.

07:36.620 --> 07:39.555
How long have you known?

07:39.656 --> 07:42.925
Known what?

07:43.026 --> 07:45.928
About all of this.

07:47.297 --> 07:49.765
I didn't know until last night.

07:51.668 --> 07:54.070
Really?

07:54.137 --> 07:57.673
I find that hard to believe.

07:57.774 --> 08:00.209
Why?

08:00.310 --> 08:02.645
Because now I understand why
I've always been on the outside

08:02.746 --> 08:03.813
of this family.

08:05.682 --> 08:08.718
It shakes a lot of things into place.

08:08.785 --> 08:11.120
It must have been pretty funny to you two.

08:11.221 --> 08:13.856
Dylan, I didn't know.

08:13.957 --> 08:15.725
We never talked about it.

08:15.792 --> 08:17.894
It was probably too painful for mother.

08:17.961 --> 08:20.997
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure it
was real hard for her.

08:23.066 --> 08:25.635
Well, it's nothing, you know... 

08:25.702 --> 08:27.069
Just a piece of information.

08:27.137 --> 08:28.704
You know, it doesn't change anything.

08:28.805 --> 08:30.506
We're all still the same
people we were yesterday.

08:30.607 --> 08:34.577
What total bullshit.

08:34.678 --> 08:38.648
What if you were given a piece
of information about yourself... 

08:38.715 --> 08:41.082
Something that... something
that totally changed the way

08:41.150 --> 08:43.852
you perceive yourself
for the rest of your life?

08:43.953 --> 08:47.156
I can't imagine anything
like that, I guess.

08:47.257 --> 08:48.958
Well, maybe you should... 

08:49.059 --> 08:52.228
maybe you should talk to mother about that.

08:52.329 --> 08:55.097
What does that mean?

08:55.165 --> 08:57.667
It means what it means.

08:57.768 --> 09:02.038
Maybe we don't all know who we are.

09:02.139 --> 09:04.173
Maybe someone's been lying to
you about an important event

09:04.274 --> 09:07.643
that happened in your life that
you have no consciousness of.

09:12.649 --> 09:14.617
Never mind. Go away. I
don't want talk to you.

09:14.718 --> 09:17.253
- Dylan.
- Go away.

09:41.078 --> 09:43.879
Norman, what's going on?

09:43.981 --> 09:46.615
I can't tell you, Emma.

09:46.717 --> 09:48.684
I've been through a lot
of stuff with you guys.

09:48.752 --> 09:51.587
I've spent most of my days
here for the last six months.

09:51.655 --> 09:53.089
I've been through that
whole stuff with your mom

09:53.190 --> 09:54.857
and the deputy and that poor girl.

09:54.925 --> 09:58.527
I've been through stuff with you.

09:58.628 --> 10:01.664
It's not like I'm an outsider.

10:06.103 --> 10:09.205
It's a family matter,
Emma. I can't tell you.

10:25.422 --> 10:28.424
Hey, Dylan!

10:28.492 --> 10:30.226
Hey, dude, I saw you up the street.

10:30.327 --> 10:32.028
I was thinking about renting a boat today,

10:32.129 --> 10:34.030
going out to see if I
can catch some salmon.

10:34.131 --> 10:35.064
You want to come?

10:35.132 --> 10:37.166
What's the matter?

10:37.234 --> 10:40.136
We can't talk anymore.

10:40.237 --> 10:43.739
Why? What happened?

10:43.840 --> 10:46.075
You had sex with my mother.

10:48.979 --> 10:51.781
When you were both teenagers,
you made her have sex with you.

10:51.882 --> 10:53.883
She told you that?

10:53.984 --> 10:56.252
Yeah.

10:56.353 --> 10:59.155
It wasn't like that, okay?

10:59.256 --> 11:00.723
It was a long time ago.

11:00.791 --> 11:03.692
It wasn't exactly like that.

11:03.794 --> 11:05.995
- You saying my mom's a liar?
- No.

11:06.063 --> 11:08.164
No, I'm not saying that.

11:09.433 --> 11:11.233
Did you know I was your son?

11:11.334 --> 11:13.436
Is that why you came here... 

11:13.537 --> 11:15.604
To work me, to try and
get me to give you money?

11:15.705 --> 11:17.306
She married a guy in high school, okay?

11:17.407 --> 11:20.276
She got knocked up. That's your dad.

11:25.882 --> 11:27.917
Dylan. Dylan.

11:35.292 --> 11:38.561
This is yours, all right? Take it.

11:43.266 --> 11:44.467
I don't know what's going on,

11:44.568 --> 11:48.003
but I never should have come here.

12:19.102 --> 12:20.169
Hello?

12:20.270 --> 12:22.071
I don't want to speak to anyone.

12:22.172 --> 12:24.273
Uh-huh. Yeah, one moment.

12:24.374 --> 12:27.309
It's for you. It's Christine.

12:37.320 --> 12:39.155
Christine? Hey.

12:39.222 --> 12:40.556
You were the hit of the party.

12:40.657 --> 12:42.691
My brother couldn't stop talking about you.

12:42.792 --> 12:44.426
He tried to do your Grand Canyon imitation

12:44.494 --> 12:45.995
and almost fell into the pool.

12:46.062 --> 12:49.231
Tell me you're free, because
Peter called in a favor

12:49.332 --> 12:51.934
and got us a table at the Greene Tavern.

12:52.035 --> 12:54.170
It's probably the best
restaurant in Oregon... 

12:54.237 --> 12:57.306
multiple courses, wine
pairings, the whole thing.

13:00.944 --> 13:02.344
I'm sorry, Christine.

13:02.412 --> 13:04.513
I... I would love to,
but I just can't today.

13:04.614 --> 13:08.117
I'm... I'm not feeling very good.

13:08.218 --> 13:11.520
But another time, okay?

13:11.621 --> 13:13.122
Okay.

13:13.223 --> 13:15.858
Okay. Bye.

13:34.511 --> 13:38.781
You know you could have told me, right?

13:38.882 --> 13:40.883
I mean, I get why you didn't tell Dylan,

13:40.984 --> 13:43.519
but you could have told me.

13:46.189 --> 13:48.891
You can always tell me anything.

14:02.105 --> 14:05.107
Is there anything else you haven't told me?

14:07.477 --> 14:10.546
No. You know everything now.

14:16.553 --> 14:20.689
I went over to that
motel to make him leave,

14:20.757 --> 14:22.591
to tell him I remember what he did to me,

14:22.659 --> 14:27.062
to face him and tell him that
I'm not scared of him anymore.

14:27.163 --> 14:31.333
But I couldn't, Norman. I couldn't.

14:31.401 --> 14:34.570
You don't need to.

14:34.671 --> 14:36.639
You don't need to, okay?

14:36.740 --> 14:38.474
You don't ever have to see him again.

14:38.575 --> 14:41.944
I wanted to. I wanted to
so much, and I couldn't.

14:42.045 --> 14:44.546
And he's still here in our town,

14:44.648 --> 14:46.282
in this place where we live.

14:46.383 --> 14:48.217
And I might see him at the
market or the gas station

14:48.318 --> 14:50.185
or God knows where.

14:50.287 --> 14:51.587
I'm just so scared.

14:56.559 --> 14:58.994
Just don't worry, okay?

14:59.095 --> 15:00.429
Please try not to worry.

15:00.497 --> 15:02.931
He just came here to
take our money from me.

15:03.033 --> 15:04.366
He took Dylan's.

15:04.467 --> 15:06.602
Then he'll leave, okay?

15:06.703 --> 15:09.972
He has no reason to stay. He'll leave.

15:12.208 --> 15:14.610
Please try not to worry, okay?

15:19.849 --> 15:23.619
I'll take good care of you. I promise.

15:55.263 --> 15:58.165
I know you said you couldn't come earlier,

15:58.266 --> 16:02.836
but I know something
about you, Norma Bates.

16:02.938 --> 16:04.838
I know you're afraid to
put yourself out there.

16:04.940 --> 16:06.807
- I am?
- Yeah.

16:06.908 --> 16:09.043
But I'm not gonna take no for an answer.

16:09.144 --> 16:10.978
Come on, let's go look in your closet

16:11.079 --> 16:13.647
and find something amazing for you to wear.

16:13.748 --> 16:15.816
You will look stunning in this.

16:15.917 --> 16:18.652
I mean, you're gorgeous
anyway, and I think I have shoes

16:18.753 --> 16:20.020
that will look fantastic with it.

16:20.121 --> 16:23.490
Ooh, never mind. These
are perfect. Perfect.

16:23.592 --> 16:25.392
Christine, I really don't feel well.

16:25.493 --> 16:30.331
- I... 
- Norma Bates, stop resisting.

16:30.432 --> 16:33.567
You are a beautiful, young woman

16:33.668 --> 16:35.369
living alone with your teenage son.

16:35.470 --> 16:37.972
But he's not gonna be
here forever, you know.

16:38.073 --> 16:39.506
People aren't meant to live alone.

16:39.608 --> 16:44.411
So you need to get back out there.

16:44.512 --> 16:46.380
I don't know how to.

16:46.481 --> 16:48.215
So many bad things have happened.

16:48.316 --> 16:52.119
There's only one way... one step at a time.

16:52.220 --> 16:53.621
So George is gonna pick you up at 7:00,

16:53.722 --> 16:56.690
and I'm gonna meet you
at the restaurant, okay?

16:56.791 --> 16:58.492
Okay.

17:03.765 --> 17:04.865
Oh, yo, Massett.

17:04.965 --> 17:07.401
I need you to drive down to Essex,

17:07.502 --> 17:08.969
see this guy named Charlie.

17:09.069 --> 17:12.940
He's got a load of guns and
ammo ready for us to pick up.

17:13.040 --> 17:16.010
Hurry up. Go. Move your ass.

17:40.001 --> 17:41.869
Why are you looking up motels?

17:41.970 --> 17:44.471
Oh, just doing research.

17:44.572 --> 17:46.740
Got to check out the competition.

17:46.841 --> 17:48.442
You don't want to tell me, that's fine,

17:48.543 --> 17:51.245
but you don't have to lie to me.

17:59.654 --> 18:01.789
Why are you hiding from that guy?

18:01.890 --> 18:04.725
What? I'm not.

18:04.826 --> 18:06.827
There's a difference between hiding

18:06.928 --> 18:09.897
and not wanting to be seen.

18:26.147 --> 18:28.816
What the hell? You're a total no-show.

18:28.917 --> 18:30.851
I spent the whole morning, hungover,

18:30.952 --> 18:32.686
painting 60 bazillion trees by myself.

18:32.787 --> 18:35.355
Cody, I'm... I'm sorry.

18:35.457 --> 18:38.525
If you say you're gonna
do something, do it.

18:43.965 --> 18:46.734
Next time, call me.

18:55.477 --> 18:58.078
Since when are you
friends with Cody Brennen?

18:58.179 --> 19:00.013
You know her?

19:00.115 --> 19:02.483
She went to our school before you came,

19:02.584 --> 19:04.818
but she dropped out.

19:04.919 --> 19:06.320
Your mom's not gonna like that.

19:21.536 --> 19:23.737
- Will you zip me?
- Yeah.

19:23.838 --> 19:26.406
Are you going out?

19:26.508 --> 19:29.109
Christine invited me. I
couldn't get out of it... 

19:29.210 --> 19:30.944
some get-together with her and her brother.

19:31.045 --> 19:32.513
I'd rather shoot myself.

19:32.614 --> 19:34.715
No, it'll be good for you to get out,

19:34.816 --> 19:38.752
forget about all this for a few hours, huh?

19:42.056 --> 19:45.993
Dylan, we should talk.

19:46.094 --> 19:47.828
About what, Norma?

19:47.929 --> 19:50.731
Don't make this harder
on me than it already is.

19:50.832 --> 19:53.033
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.

19:53.134 --> 19:55.002
I'm such a dick for
making this hard on you.

19:55.103 --> 19:57.437
Dylan.

19:57.539 --> 19:59.873
What do you both want from me?

19:59.974 --> 20:01.842
You think that I just have a magic wand

20:01.943 --> 20:03.544
that will make this go away?

20:03.645 --> 20:06.446
There are things in life
that have consequences, Norma.

20:06.548 --> 20:10.050
You're looking at one. I'm a consequence.

20:10.151 --> 20:12.519
No, you're not. You're not a consequence.

20:12.620 --> 20:14.888
You need to be strong. You
need to put this behind you.

20:14.989 --> 20:17.524
I can't put this behind me.

20:17.625 --> 20:21.695
It's me. How can I put me behind me?

20:23.865 --> 20:27.234
He's... he's just a... he's a bad person.

20:27.335 --> 20:29.870
He... he just came here to
try to get money from you.

20:29.971 --> 20:30.971
Is that right?

20:31.072 --> 20:33.173
I ran into him today.

20:33.274 --> 20:36.677
I told him what you told
me about him being my dad.

20:36.778 --> 20:38.078
And then he handed me this back... 

20:38.179 --> 20:39.780
all the money that I gave him.

20:39.881 --> 20:41.815
So I guess he wasn't just
here to get money from me.

20:41.916 --> 20:45.485
You saw him? What else did he say?

20:45.587 --> 20:47.921
You know what? Just
forget that I mentioned it.

20:48.022 --> 20:49.890
Dylan. D... 

20:52.218 --> 20:54.278
Stay here, okay? I'll get it.

21:01.169 --> 21:02.502
Hi.

21:02.604 --> 21:04.171
You must be Norman. I'm George.

21:04.272 --> 21:05.606
Oh, yeah. Hello, there.

21:05.707 --> 21:07.507
Hi. Nice to meet you.

21:07.609 --> 21:10.777
- Is your mom ready?
- George, hi.

21:13.348 --> 21:14.681
Wow. Hi.

21:14.782 --> 21:16.984
You look fantastic.

21:17.085 --> 21:19.987
I was just meeting Norman.

21:20.088 --> 21:23.423
Shall we?

21:23.524 --> 21:25.292
Okay. Bye, honey. I'll see you later.

21:25.393 --> 21:27.194
What time do you think you'll be back?

21:27.295 --> 21:31.031
- I'm not sure really.
- Don't worry.

21:31.132 --> 21:33.667
I'll make sure she
doesn't get into trouble.

21:33.768 --> 21:36.003
Bye, Norman.

21:47.154 --> 21:49.922
Dude. Go easy.

21:49.990 --> 21:52.124
Sorry. Yeah.

21:52.225 --> 21:54.493
I guess it's done.

21:54.595 --> 21:56.429
Are you still bumming
about that Bradley chick,

21:56.530 --> 21:59.098
or is this 'cause we thought you were gay?

21:59.166 --> 22:02.668
No, it's actually... it's about my mom.

22:02.769 --> 22:05.204
Yeah, well, parents suck,
and if you only have one,

22:05.272 --> 22:06.572
they find a way to suck enough for two.

22:06.640 --> 22:08.441
No, my mother's not like that.

22:08.542 --> 22:09.809
She's not like anyone else.

22:09.910 --> 22:13.112
Why? What makes her such a special case?

22:13.180 --> 22:15.681
'Cause she'd do anything for me.

22:15.782 --> 22:20.086
Have you ever had anyone that
would do anything for you?

22:22.189 --> 22:24.690
Anyway, you know, she... 
she just tries so hard,

22:24.791 --> 22:27.226
and this... this thing happened, and... 

22:27.294 --> 22:29.762
And I'm just worried about her.

22:29.830 --> 22:31.263
What happened?

22:34.735 --> 22:36.969
Tell me.

22:37.070 --> 22:38.437
She's got this, uh... 

22:38.538 --> 22:40.606
this brother who showed up out of nowhere.

22:40.707 --> 22:43.075
And she doesn't want him
here, and he won't leave.

22:43.176 --> 22:45.878
It's just a big deal 'cause... 
'cause he's a bad guy.

22:45.979 --> 22:47.513
Bad like how?

22:47.581 --> 22:51.050
Uh, bad like, um... 

22:51.118 --> 22:53.686
Bad.

22:53.754 --> 22:57.957
He was abusive when they were kids.

22:58.025 --> 23:02.395
I just don't like him
being here, being near her.

23:04.031 --> 23:07.767
Damn. You actually love
your mom, don't you?

23:10.137 --> 23:11.837
Why don't you just beat
this guy and get rid of him?

23:11.938 --> 23:13.739
I can't.

23:13.840 --> 23:16.208
I never... I could never
do anything like that.

23:16.309 --> 23:17.843
Sure you can.

23:17.944 --> 23:19.545
I can totally walk you through it.

23:19.646 --> 23:21.647
We'll scare the crap out of him,

23:21.748 --> 23:25.584
and then he won't bother your mom anymore.

23:33.860 --> 23:35.761
Cupcake girl.

23:35.862 --> 23:37.563
Yes.

23:37.664 --> 23:40.199
- Sorry to bother you.
- You're not bothering me.

23:40.300 --> 23:42.568
Well, good. Okay.

23:42.669 --> 23:45.638
I just wanted to ask you something.

23:45.706 --> 23:48.074
It's a simple "yes or no" question.

23:48.141 --> 23:52.011
Okay. Go for it.

23:52.112 --> 23:54.146
Did I... did we... 

23:59.352 --> 24:01.787
Last night. Um... 

24:01.888 --> 24:03.389
No. No, you just got wasted.

24:03.490 --> 24:06.492
I didn't really know where to bring you.

24:06.593 --> 24:08.794
Not that I didn't want to sleep with you.

24:08.895 --> 24:12.064
It's just I prefer it when
the girl's conscious, you know.

24:12.165 --> 24:16.802
Besides, if we, uh... 
if we did sleep together,

24:16.903 --> 24:19.405
you'd remember.

24:23.343 --> 24:25.644
I'm just so relieved that we didn't.

24:25.712 --> 24:28.180
You have... you have no idea
how... how relieved I am.

24:28.281 --> 24:30.349
- Relieved?
- Yeah.

24:30.450 --> 24:32.752
Well, I better get back to the desk

24:32.819 --> 24:35.421
and... and let you get back
to whatever you were doing.

24:35.522 --> 24:37.123
I'm guessing you've checked in here.

24:37.190 --> 24:38.691
You don't remember?

24:38.792 --> 24:39.992
You actually checked me in last night

24:40.093 --> 24:41.527
before you said you were going to vomit.

24:41.628 --> 24:45.297
It was kind of funny till you actually did.

24:45.365 --> 24:48.834
Okay. I'm sorry about that.

24:48.935 --> 24:50.636
I'll be around for a couple weeks, though.

24:50.737 --> 24:53.005
- I'm selling pot for the summer.
- Okay.

24:53.106 --> 24:55.875
Have fun with that.

24:55.976 --> 24:58.010
Thank you for... for looking after me.

24:58.111 --> 24:59.745
No worries.

25:06.698 --> 25:09.722
So she says, "I absolutely
did not buy a single thing."

25:09.823 --> 25:11.891
Meanwhile, the customs
guy is staring at the tag

25:11.992 --> 25:13.492
hanging off the back of her jacket.

25:13.560 --> 25:15.594
Speaking of shop I can't wait

25:15.662 --> 25:17.296
- for that new Costco to open.
- Oh, my God.

25:17.397 --> 25:19.064
Peter's obsessed with Costco.

25:19.132 --> 25:21.267
It appeals to his
hunter/gatherer instincts.

25:21.368 --> 25:22.701
They're putting in a Costco?

25:22.769 --> 25:24.637
Yeah. Out by the new bypass road.

25:24.738 --> 25:26.138
Well, I wish that wasn't happening.

25:26.206 --> 25:27.706
It's gonna wreck my little business.

25:27.774 --> 25:29.975
It's just gonna totally cut us off.

25:30.043 --> 25:31.443
Oh, I'm sure tourists

25:31.545 --> 25:33.279
are still gonna want to
come into town the old way.

25:33.346 --> 25:34.613
Oh, come on, now. Don't lie to her.

25:34.681 --> 25:36.282
You remember route 66, right, babe?

25:36.383 --> 25:38.484
Shut up, Peter. Don't be a jerk.

25:38.585 --> 25:40.853
I'm sure she doesn't want to
hear about route 66 right now.

25:40.954 --> 25:44.089
It's okay. It's not like I
don't know they're building it.

25:44.191 --> 25:45.658
Well, exactly, and hiding your head

25:45.759 --> 25:47.393
in the sand isn't gonna
make it go away, right?

25:47.494 --> 25:49.895
The new bypass road is coming,
and so are the big-box stores.

25:49.963 --> 25:51.697
Shut up, Peter. You're an idiot.

25:51.798 --> 25:53.232
Oh, you can't blame a man for being excited

25:53.333 --> 25:54.767
about buying in bulk.

25:54.868 --> 25:56.101
There you go.

25:59.606 --> 26:03.609
Excuse me for a moment. I'll be right back.

26:38.879 --> 26:40.779
- Hey.
- Oh.

26:40.881 --> 26:42.982
Sorry about Peter. He
seriously needs a filter.

26:43.083 --> 26:45.317
- Oh, I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

26:45.418 --> 26:47.753
'Cause if my motel was
being threatened by a bypass

26:47.821 --> 26:49.521
and stupid people were
making jokes about it,

26:49.623 --> 26:52.091
I don't think I'd feel too good.

26:52.192 --> 26:54.793
Thank you.

26:54.895 --> 26:55.995
Let's get through that crème brulee,

26:56.096 --> 26:58.330
- and I'll drive you home.
- Okay.

26:59.833 --> 27:00.933
I've got a lot of experience

27:01.001 --> 27:02.468
in my family with crap like this.

27:02.569 --> 27:04.403
You got to show someone you're serious.

27:04.471 --> 27:06.472
My aunt's lame-ass ex was a real prick.

27:06.573 --> 27:08.707
Wouldn't pay alimony.

27:08.808 --> 27:10.409
My grandma hit him with a baseball bat.

27:10.477 --> 27:13.946
Guess what. He paid up.

27:14.014 --> 27:15.848
So what exactly are we gonna do?

27:15.916 --> 27:17.883
Where is this damn thing?

27:17.984 --> 27:19.451
You're supposed to keep

27:19.552 --> 27:21.086
two hands on the wheel at all times.

27:21.187 --> 27:24.123
Got it.

27:24.190 --> 27:25.624
What's this?

27:25.725 --> 27:29.094
It's your superpower... a tire iron.

28:00.860 --> 28:02.494
Norman, can I tell you something

28:02.595 --> 28:05.197
that I've never told anyone?

28:05.298 --> 28:08.867
My brother used to make
me have sex with him.

28:12.238 --> 28:16.241
I was, like, 13.

28:16.343 --> 28:20.145
And it went on until he moved out.

28:20.246 --> 28:21.180
I couldn't tell anyone.

28:31.247 --> 28:33.214
Room 16.

28:33.282 --> 28:35.016
Let's do this.

28:43.459 --> 28:46.461
You okay?

28:46.562 --> 28:48.663
I don't think I can do this.

28:48.731 --> 28:51.933
Yes, you can do it. We're
just gonna scare him.

28:52.001 --> 28:55.036
No, no, I can't go in
there. I need to leave.

28:55.104 --> 28:56.905
Norman, come on.

28:57.006 --> 28:59.407
No, I have to leave.

28:59.475 --> 29:01.075
Take me away from here.

29:01.177 --> 29:04.612
Okay, Norman, calm down. We can go, okay?

29:14.185 --> 29:15.418
Hey.

29:15.519 --> 29:17.287
Oh, my God. Hi.

29:17.388 --> 29:19.155
Sorry. Can I ask you something?

29:19.256 --> 29:21.224
Yeah, sure.

29:21.325 --> 29:24.461
When you said you were
relieved that we didn't hook up,

29:24.562 --> 29:26.162
what did you mean by that?

29:26.263 --> 29:27.530
I mean, maybe that's to
say you're not interested,

29:27.631 --> 29:30.900
but I don't get that from you.

29:31.001 --> 29:33.570
Maybe I'm talking stupid,
but I thought I'd ask.

29:33.671 --> 29:34.971
It seemed like the easiest way to do it.

29:35.072 --> 29:37.907
I do want to have sex with you.

29:38.008 --> 29:40.510
Okay. What are you doing tonight?

29:40.611 --> 29:43.346
Oh, my God.

29:43.447 --> 29:45.315
I'm kidding. That was just a joke.

29:45.416 --> 29:46.649
I was just relieved

29:46.751 --> 29:50.286
because it would have been my first time.

29:50.388 --> 29:52.122
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.

29:52.223 --> 29:54.090
I, um... I didn't realize.

29:54.191 --> 29:56.893
You didn't?

29:56.994 --> 29:58.461
Well, just think how much pressure people

29:58.562 --> 30:00.296
put on their first time,

30:00.398 --> 30:02.499
knowing that they're going
to have, like, a million more.

30:02.600 --> 30:04.567
Mine could be my only time, so I just... 

30:04.668 --> 30:08.471
I just wanted to make it count... 

30:08.572 --> 30:11.608
Or at least be something
I can actually remember.

30:11.709 --> 30:14.511
You're right.

30:15.713 --> 30:19.215
You deserve that.

30:19.316 --> 30:20.984
See you tomorrow?

30:21.085 --> 30:22.652
I'll be here.

30:22.753 --> 30:26.222
Me too.

30:41.739 --> 30:45.041
At least the food was good.

30:49.079 --> 30:51.114
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have gone.

30:51.215 --> 30:52.482
I wasn't up for it.

30:52.583 --> 30:54.484
Christine just really wanted me to go.

30:56.086 --> 30:57.720
- Yeah, that's Christine for you.
- Mm.

30:59.423 --> 31:01.291
You should have tried growing up with her.

31:01.392 --> 31:03.159
Mm.

31:03.260 --> 31:04.928
She was a force of nature.

31:05.029 --> 31:07.397
I know. She got me to go.

31:09.733 --> 31:12.936
She's been nothing but nice to me.

31:16.073 --> 31:18.475
She's kind of taken with you.

31:38.095 --> 31:42.365
Thank you so much for dinner.

31:42.466 --> 31:44.634
Of course.

31:44.735 --> 31:46.870
I'd really like to take
you out again sometime.

31:46.971 --> 31:49.539
I promise we'll leave Peter at home.

31:54.278 --> 31:56.613
Thank you.

32:38.689 --> 32:41.991
Zane Morgan, right?

32:44.161 --> 32:46.596
Yeah. So what do you want?

32:46.697 --> 32:48.498
I thought it was time for us to meet.

32:48.599 --> 32:50.466
I'm Alex Romero.

32:50.568 --> 32:53.403
Oh, yeah. You're that
guy with the God complex.

32:54.939 --> 32:57.840
Come here.

33:11.188 --> 33:13.957
You... you've been away a long time, Zane,

33:14.058 --> 33:15.792
and I think you might have forgotten

33:15.893 --> 33:18.928
how things work around here.

33:19.029 --> 33:20.663
Well, things didn't
work out so well for Gil,

33:20.764 --> 33:23.099
so I figured maybe there were
better ways of doing things.

33:23.200 --> 33:25.568
No. No, there are not.

33:29.540 --> 33:32.508
What the hell are you looking at?

33:32.610 --> 33:34.110
Well, a guy like you, Zane,

33:34.211 --> 33:36.546
I could just see making some big mistakes,

33:36.647 --> 33:39.315
just taking things a little personally

33:39.416 --> 33:42.785
and feeling like he had to prove himself,

33:42.886 --> 33:44.721
you know, by yelling the loudest

33:44.822 --> 33:47.724
and doing the most damage,

33:47.825 --> 33:51.294
taking the most scalps... 

33:51.395 --> 33:53.262
Make sure people took him seriously

33:53.364 --> 33:56.566
'cause nobody does.

33:56.667 --> 34:00.136
- Hey, you want a beer?
- Okay. All right.

34:00.237 --> 34:01.771
I'm gonna take that as confirmation

34:01.872 --> 34:03.706
that you actually heard
me, all right, Zane?

34:03.807 --> 34:07.810
'Cause, make no mistake... it's a warning.

34:07.911 --> 34:12.748
I can be a real nice guy till I break you.

34:45.382 --> 34:47.483
What are you doing?

34:47.583 --> 34:48.784
I'm moving, Norma.

34:48.886 --> 34:50.786
Why?

34:50.888 --> 34:54.023
Only you would ask that.

34:54.123 --> 34:55.824
Why do you have to move? I don't get it.

34:55.926 --> 34:58.728
What is that gonna prove, hmm?

34:58.829 --> 35:00.863
You made this mess.

35:00.964 --> 35:02.231
Live with it. I'm not going to.

35:02.332 --> 35:03.399
I made this mess? That's funny.

35:03.500 --> 35:04.734
I thought I got raped.

35:04.835 --> 35:07.837
Yeah, well, that's not what he said.

35:07.938 --> 35:09.272
What the hell did he say?

35:09.373 --> 35:11.674
He said that it wasn't like that,

35:11.775 --> 35:13.810
whatever that means.

35:13.911 --> 35:16.312
He said that he wasn't my father,

35:16.413 --> 35:18.581
that you got pregnant in.

35:18.682 --> 35:21.050
It's because he doesn't know.

35:21.151 --> 35:24.320
I never told him. I never told anyone.

35:32.663 --> 35:34.564
Why did you have me, Norma?

35:34.665 --> 35:37.633
Why?

35:42.005 --> 35:43.806
Yeah. That's what I thought.

35:46.877 --> 35:48.811
You sure you're okay?

35:48.912 --> 35:50.480
Yes, I'm fine.

35:50.581 --> 35:52.782
I just changed my mind
about wanting to do that.

35:52.883 --> 35:55.952
- That's all.
- Okay.

36:05.496 --> 36:09.599
- What does that mean?
- Leave me alone, Norma.

36:09.700 --> 36:10.700
Stop it. Move!

36:10.801 --> 36:13.369
What does that mean?

36:13.470 --> 36:16.239
You used me to get out of your house.

36:16.340 --> 36:18.508
You got knocked up by your brother,

36:18.609 --> 36:20.276
and rather than having an abortion,

36:20.377 --> 36:24.046
you used me to get your
boyfriend to marry you.

36:24.148 --> 36:27.150
You made him... you made
him think that I was his.

36:27.251 --> 36:29.752
You brought me into this world, using me... 

36:29.853 --> 36:32.455
knowing what I was, not caring,

36:32.556 --> 36:33.923
just thinking about yourself.

36:34.024 --> 36:36.692
Dylan, it wasn't like that.

36:36.794 --> 36:39.395
You have to believe me.

36:39.496 --> 36:41.764
I was so scared. You have no idea.

36:41.865 --> 36:43.900
I had no one to protect me.

36:44.001 --> 36:46.002
I was a little girl. I was a kid.

36:46.103 --> 36:48.471
My father scared the crap out of me.

36:48.572 --> 36:50.873
My mother was sedated all the time.

36:50.974 --> 36:52.809
My brother would not leave me alone.

36:52.910 --> 36:54.377
I had to get away.

36:54.478 --> 36:56.612
I had no voice to tell him not to do it.

36:56.713 --> 36:58.414
I had no power to stop him.

36:58.515 --> 37:00.883
I wanted to stop him. God
knows I wanted to stop him.

37:00.984 --> 37:02.785
I wanted to tell him to leave me alone.

37:02.886 --> 37:04.520
I wanted to tell him.

37:04.621 --> 37:08.791
I wanted to tell him to leave me alone.

37:08.892 --> 37:10.960
None of this is your fault.

37:11.061 --> 37:13.129
It's not your fault, but
it's not my fault either.

37:13.230 --> 37:16.766
I was a child. I was way
younger than your brother is now.

37:18.635 --> 37:20.503
Move away from the door.

37:20.604 --> 37:22.071
No. No.

37:22.172 --> 37:25.408
Move away from the damn door!

38:21.764 --> 38:24.065
What do you want?

38:24.166 --> 38:25.300
We need to talk.

38:25.401 --> 38:27.168
About what? Who are you?

38:27.270 --> 38:29.404
I'm Norman Bates.

38:29.505 --> 38:31.967
Jeez, look, I got nothing
to say to any of you.

38:32.068 --> 38:33.335
Leave me alone.

38:33.436 --> 38:34.903
Listen, you need to leave now,

38:35.004 --> 38:36.872
or you're not gonna like what happens.

38:36.973 --> 38:41.210
No, I said we're gonna talk!
I've been silenced long enough!

38:41.311 --> 38:45.114
Look, I don't know what
you're talking about, man.

38:55.358 --> 38:57.459
I came here to tell you

38:57.560 --> 38:59.761
that I remember what you did to me

38:59.863 --> 39:02.931
and to face you and tell you

39:03.032 --> 39:06.335
I'm not scared of you anymore.

39:06.436 --> 39:09.705
And all those nights you came in my room,

39:09.806 --> 39:12.407
I was too young to know the difference.

39:12.509 --> 39:15.110
I was too young.

39:15.211 --> 39:17.446
I just needed someone to care about me,

39:17.547 --> 39:20.749
and all you did was use
me, you son of a bitch.

39:20.850 --> 39:23.018
I never did anything to you, all right?

39:23.119 --> 39:25.287
Don't lie again.

39:28.825 --> 39:31.360
Listen, you're crazy, all right?

39:31.461 --> 39:33.162
Stay the hell away from me.

39:33.263 --> 39:35.063
You raped me... 

39:35.165 --> 39:37.633
Over and over.

39:37.734 --> 39:40.211
I was your little sister. I loved you.

39:42.205 --> 39:44.072
You should have protected
me because I had no one

39:44.174 --> 39:47.009
to protect me.

40:07.063 --> 40:10.766
It's all right. Just calm down, all right?

40:10.867 --> 40:12.501
What... what exactly
happened? When did it start?

40:12.602 --> 40:15.437
Roger that. Sheriff, sheriff!

40:15.538 --> 40:17.406
Hold on a second. Yeah?

40:17.507 --> 40:20.409
You got to get out to
your house right away.

40:20.510 --> 40:22.611
- What is it?
- Just... just go.

40:22.712 --> 40:24.379
- I'll take care of this.
- Okay, okay.

41:09.125 --> 41:11.260
I'm Cody Brennen. Someone called.

41:11.361 --> 41:14.129
He's been sitting like that
for the last half hour... 

41:14.230 --> 41:15.998
No I.D., no phone.

41:16.099 --> 41:19.501
Good thing he had your number on his arm.

41:19.602 --> 41:22.137
You call the cops?

41:22.238 --> 41:25.507
Not yet.

41:25.608 --> 41:30.252
Norman.

41:30.353 --> 41:32.287
Can you hear me?

41:35.458 --> 41:39.427
I need you to get up.
You got to come with me.

41:39.529 --> 41:42.397
That's it... one foot
in front of the other.

41:47.136 --> 41:49.938
We're going to the car.

41:53.309 --> 41:56.311
What happened to you, Norman?

42:04.269 --> 42:05.497
Everything will be okay.
