WEBVTT

00:01.752 --> 00:04.287
Okay, Babydoll Pink, let's see
if you can cover up the fact

00:04.304 --> 00:06.438
that I got my dad's feet.

00:06.439 --> 00:08.507
It's just two degrees, Sheldon.

00:08.508 --> 00:10.908
I just want to turn up the
thermostat two degrees!

00:11.082 --> 00:14.185
Let me point out that two
degrees can be the difference

00:14.186 --> 00:16.219
between water and steam.

00:16.221 --> 00:18.455
Yes, if we lived in a teakettle.

00:18.456 --> 00:20.157
This is the temperature
you agreed to

00:20.158 --> 00:21.525
in the roommate agreement.

00:21.526 --> 00:23.561
Aw, screw the roommate agreement!

00:23.562 --> 00:25.596
No, you don't screw the
roommate agreement.

00:25.597 --> 00:28.332
The roommate agreement screws you.

00:28.333 --> 00:30.734
You know what, go to Hell
and set their thermostat.

00:30.735 --> 00:32.403
I don't have to go to Hell.

00:32.404 --> 00:36.340
At 73 degrees, I'm there already!

00:37.709 --> 00:41.946
Who is it?

00:41.947 --> 00:43.314
Leonard.

00:43.315 --> 00:45.316
Hang on.

00:49.332 --> 00:51.767
Can I sleep on your couch tonight?

00:51.768 --> 00:53.035
Uh, well, you can try,

00:53.036 --> 00:55.237
but the people across the
hall are being very noisy.

00:55.238 --> 00:57.673
You heard that, huh?

00:57.674 --> 01:00.709
Apparently, the one fella tried
to adjust the thermostat,

01:00.710 --> 01:03.312
then the other fella
went bat-crap crazy.

01:03.313 --> 01:05.480
So you agree, he's nuts.

01:05.482 --> 01:08.717
Well, not as nuts as the guy
who chooses to live with him.

01:08.718 --> 01:10.786
Believe it or not,
he was worse when I met him.

01:10.787 --> 01:13.155
Oh, I do not believe that.

01:13.156 --> 01:15.658
You are so naive.

01:15.659 --> 01:17.927
Just like I was seven years ago.

01:18.962 --> 01:21.897
<i>I'd just started at the university.</i>

01:26.469 --> 01:28.170
Excuse me, I'm looking

01:28.171 --> 01:30.639
for Sheldon Cooper's apartment.

01:30.640 --> 01:32.541
Oh, I bet you're here to
check out the room for rent.

01:32.542 --> 01:34.977
Yeah. Run away, dude.

01:36.213 --> 01:37.513
What?!

01:37.514 --> 01:40.916
Run fast, run far.

01:40.917 --> 01:43.919
That should have
been my first clue.

02:10.984 --> 02:13.353
So Sheldon's last roommate
tried to warn you off?

02:13.751 --> 02:17.086
For all I knew,
he was the crazy one.

02:17.087 --> 02:19.589
He had this really deranged look.

02:19.590 --> 02:22.625
Well, yeah, he'd been
living with Sheldon.

02:22.626 --> 02:25.895
Sure, it makes sense <i>now.</i>

02:28.165 --> 02:31.100
<i>Anyway, I went upstairs</i>
<i>and knocked on the door.</i>

02:36.874 --> 02:38.474

02:47.451 --> 02:49.185
Dr. Cooper?

02:49.186 --> 02:52.488
No, you want the crazy
guy across the hall.

02:56.093 --> 02:59.662
<i>In retrospect, that was clue
number two.</i>

03:05.736 --> 03:07.036
Yes?

03:07.037 --> 03:08.638
I'm Leonard Hofstadter.

03:08.639 --> 03:10.473
I called you about the apartment.
You said...

03:10.474 --> 03:11.574
I know what I said.

03:11.575 --> 03:12.809
I know what you said.

03:12.810 --> 03:15.378
I know what my mother
said on March 5, 1992.

03:16.513 --> 03:18.748
What is the sixth noble gas?

03:18.749 --> 03:21.251
What? You said you're a scientist.

03:21.252 --> 03:23.052
What is the sixth noble gas?

03:23.053 --> 03:24.287
Uh, radon?

03:24.288 --> 03:27.557
Are you asking me or telling me?

03:27.558 --> 03:29.559
Telling you?

03:31.495 --> 03:34.364
Telling you.

03:34.365 --> 03:36.566
All right, next question.

03:36.567 --> 03:38.268
Kirk or Picard?

03:38.269 --> 03:40.837
Oh, uh, well, that's tricky.

03:40.838 --> 03:44.240
Um, Original Series over
<i>Next Generation,</i>

03:44.241 --> 03:46.075
but Picard over Kirk.

03:46.076 --> 03:47.944
Correct.

03:49.079 --> 03:51.381
You've passed the first
barrier to roommate-hood.

03:52.082 --> 03:53.750
You may enter.

03:53.751 --> 03:56.185
Oh, this is pretty nice.

04:03.360 --> 04:05.561
Uh, the bedrooms are back there?

04:05.562 --> 04:06.729
That depends.

04:06.730 --> 04:07.764
I don't understand--

04:07.765 --> 04:10.233
their existence is conditional?

04:10.234 --> 04:13.670
No, but your ability to perceive
their existence is conditional

04:13.671 --> 04:16.238
on you passing the second
and third barriers.

04:16.240 --> 04:17.774
There's three?

04:17.774 --> 04:20.209
Each more daunting than the last.

04:21.545 --> 04:22.578
Have a seat.

04:22.579 --> 04:24.147
Okay.

04:24.148 --> 04:26.616
No! That's where I sit!

04:29.753 --> 04:32.221
What's the difference?

04:32.222 --> 04:34.457
This seat is ideally located

04:34.458 --> 04:36.759
both in relation to the
heat source in the winter

04:36.760 --> 04:38.695
and a cross breeze in the summer.

04:38.696 --> 04:41.164
It also faces the television
at a direct angle--

04:41.165 --> 04:44.200
allowing me to immerse myself
in entertainment or game play

04:44.201 --> 04:45.968
without being subjected
to conversation.

04:45.969 --> 04:50.773
As a result, I've placed it
in a state of eternal dibs.

04:50.774 --> 04:53.076
Can you do that?

04:53.077 --> 04:56.279
<i>Cathedra mea, regulae meae.</i>

04:57.214 --> 05:00.383
That's Latin for "my chair,
my rules."

05:01.785 --> 05:04.554
Now, you said on the phone

05:04.555 --> 05:07.790
that your area of study is physics.

05:07.791 --> 05:09.225
Uh, yeah, experimental physics.

05:09.226 --> 05:11.828
Hmm...

05:11.829 --> 05:13.763
What is that?

05:13.764 --> 05:14.997
Doesn't concern you.

05:14.998 --> 05:16.232
You'll be going

05:16.233 --> 05:18.735
to the university every day? Yes.

05:18.736 --> 05:20.036
And you have a vehicle?
A car, yeah.

05:20.037 --> 05:21.471
And you'll be willing to drive me?

05:21.472 --> 05:22.772
Can't you drive?

05:22.773 --> 05:24.741
I can.

05:26.610 --> 05:29.011
I choose not to.

05:29.012 --> 05:31.914
Okay, I suppose I could drive you.

05:32.816 --> 05:34.951
That's a point in my favor, right?

05:34.952 --> 05:37.353
Why don't you let me do this.

05:37.354 --> 05:39.355
Come on, I just asked.

05:43.627 --> 05:44.861
Last question.

05:44.862 --> 05:46.129
In a post-apocalyptic world,

05:46.130 --> 05:49.198
which task would you assign
the highest priority?

05:49.199 --> 05:51.367
Locating a sustainable food source,

05:51.368 --> 05:53.035
reestablishing a
functioning government,

05:53.036 --> 05:55.872
procreating, or preserving
the knowledge of mankind?

05:55.873 --> 05:59.275
Uh, I'm gonna go with...
preserving the knowledge.

05:59.276 --> 06:00.443
That's correct.

06:01.678 --> 06:05.948
FYI, I would have accepted any
answer other than procreating.

06:07.184 --> 06:09.385
Come, I'll show you the
rest of the apartment.

06:09.386 --> 06:10.520
Oh, good.

06:10.521 --> 06:11.854
I passed the barriers.

06:11.855 --> 06:14.457
The second barrier.
Don't get cocky.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.662
This is the bathroom.

06:19.663 --> 06:21.397
Are you fairly regular?

06:23.567 --> 06:25.902
Uh, I guess.

06:25.903 --> 06:28.337
This isn't going to
work if you're guessing.

06:29.106 --> 06:31.841
When do you evacuate your bowels?

06:31.842 --> 06:34.343
When I have to.

06:34.344 --> 06:35.912
When you have to?

06:35.913 --> 06:37.747
I'm sorry, I don't rent to hippies.

06:41.518 --> 06:43.152
I-I'm sorry, uh, in the morning.

06:43.153 --> 06:44.654
Around 8:00.

06:44.655 --> 06:48.691
I can't give you 8:00.
I can give you 7:30.

06:48.692 --> 06:50.493
Fine. I'll take it.

06:50.494 --> 06:52.395
Third barrier passed.

06:53.297 --> 06:55.698
You have won the right
to see your room.

06:55.699 --> 06:57.366
Huzzah.

07:00.070 --> 07:01.737
Is this it?

07:01.738 --> 07:03.105
No, this is my room.

07:03.106 --> 07:04.874
People don't go in my room.

07:04.875 --> 07:08.311
So where do you sleep?

07:08.312 --> 07:10.112
I don't understand.

07:10.113 --> 07:13.783
If people don't go in there,
and you're people, and...

07:13.784 --> 07:16.452
You are people, aren't you?

07:17.254 --> 07:18.921
Making a joke.

07:18.922 --> 07:20.623
Do you do this often?

07:20.624 --> 07:23.359
On occasion.

07:27.331 --> 07:29.131
Your room.

07:36.907 --> 07:39.308
You may want to repaint.

07:41.245 --> 07:44.413
And after all that,
you just moved in?

07:44.414 --> 07:45.515
I didn't just move in.

07:45.516 --> 07:47.683
First we had to iron
out a few details.

07:47.684 --> 07:51.187
"Roommates agree that Friday
nights shall be reserved

07:51.188 --> 07:52.154
"for watching Joss Whedon's

07:52.155 --> 07:54.790
brilliant new series <i>Firefly."</i>

07:54.791 --> 07:58.027
Does that really need
to be in the agreement?

07:58.028 --> 08:01.864
We might as well settle it now;
it's going to be on for years.

08:01.865 --> 08:04.333
Initial here.

08:05.469 --> 08:11.073
All right, that's
television and movies.

08:11.074 --> 08:14.143
Section nine: miscellany.

08:14.144 --> 08:15.645
The apartment's flag

08:15.646 --> 08:19.949
is a gold lion rampant
on a field of azure.

08:19.950 --> 08:21.751
We have a flag?

08:31.662 --> 08:33.361
Never fly it upside down.

08:34.664 --> 08:36.499
Unless the apartment's in distress.

08:36.500 --> 08:37.767
And next.

08:37.768 --> 08:40.135
"If either of us ever
invents time travel,

08:40.136 --> 08:44.173
"we agree our first stop
will be this meeting today

08:44.174 --> 08:46.442
in precisely five seconds."

08:47.978 --> 08:50.112
Okay.

09:00.157 --> 09:02.458
That's disappointing.

09:04.761 --> 09:06.996
Why on earth did you
agree to all that?

09:06.997 --> 09:08.931
It was the best apartment I'd seen,

09:08.932 --> 09:10.933
the rent was very reasonable

09:10.934 --> 09:12.935
and after you've passed
the first three barriers

09:12.936 --> 09:15.004
you kind of want to
take it all the way.

09:15.005 --> 09:19.775
Well, I'm sorry, Leonard,
it's very hard to feel sympathy for you.

09:19.776 --> 09:22.011
Okay, how about this?
Let me tell you about the first time

09:22.012 --> 09:22.945
I brought a girl over.

09:22.946 --> 09:25.314
Leonard?

09:26.483 --> 09:29.218
Shh. Just pretend we're not here.

09:30.554 --> 09:33.122
Leonard?

09:33.123 --> 09:35.391
I'm sure he'll go away.

09:37.494 --> 09:40.630
I'm just going to keep
knocking till you answer.

09:40.631 --> 09:41.731
Leonard?

09:41.732 --> 09:43.199
Leonard?

09:43.200 --> 09:44.367
Leonard?

09:44.368 --> 09:45.868
What do you want?!

09:45.869 --> 09:48.070
I didn't say come in!

09:48.071 --> 09:49.972
You asked what I wanted.

09:49.973 --> 09:51.607
I wanted to come in.

09:51.608 --> 09:53.376
I'm here

09:53.377 --> 09:55.544
because you violated
our roommate agreement.

09:55.545 --> 09:57.546
Specifically, section eight--

09:57.547 --> 10:01.117
visitors, subsection C;
females, paragraph four-- coitus.

10:01.118 --> 10:03.152
"Roommates shall give each other

10:03.153 --> 10:06.722
12 hours notice of
impending coitus."

10:06.723 --> 10:09.925
I didn't even know
her 12 hours ago.

10:09.926 --> 10:11.360
That's it! I'm out of here!

10:11.361 --> 10:12.728
But, Joyce, come on.

10:12.729 --> 10:14.363
12 hours?

10:17.000 --> 10:18.701
Oh, my God.

10:18.702 --> 10:20.269
Do I get some sympathy now?

10:20.270 --> 10:22.304
A little bit.

10:26.123 --> 10:27.143
Okay. Let me get this straight.

10:27.153 --> 10:28.273
You move in with this guy,

10:28.706 --> 10:30.875
he makes you sign a
ridiculous roommate agreement,

10:31.029 --> 10:32.863
then he walks into your bedroom

10:32.864 --> 10:35.499
while you're doing this Joyce Kim,
and you still stay?

10:35.500 --> 10:38.268
Actually, I couldn't get too
mad at him about Joyce Kim.

10:38.269 --> 10:39.603
Why not?

10:39.604 --> 10:42.172
Well, I was doing some
government research at the time,

10:42.173 --> 10:44.108
you know, military, rocket fuel.

10:44.109 --> 10:45.375
It's kind of secret.

10:45.376 --> 10:47.177
What does that have
to do with Joyce Kim?

10:47.178 --> 10:50.481
As it turns out,
she was a North Korean spy.

10:51.883 --> 10:53.851
Luckily, Sheldon drove her out

10:53.852 --> 10:55.819
before I revealed
anything important.

10:55.820 --> 10:58.689
Which I-I'm not
saying I would have.

10:59.791 --> 11:00.858
So, what, that's it?

11:00.859 --> 11:02.459
You've stayed with
Sheldon all this time

11:02.460 --> 11:04.561
because he kept you from
going to federal prison?

11:04.562 --> 11:05.996
That was part of it.

11:05.997 --> 11:08.665
The other part is what
happened with the elevator.

11:08.666 --> 11:09.833
Oh, yeah, I'm wondering about that.

11:09.834 --> 11:11.668
You said it was working
when you moved in.

11:11.669 --> 11:14.938
It was, but one night,
Sheldon came home from work...

11:24.249 --> 11:26.850
What is going on here?

11:26.851 --> 11:28.051
Hey, Sheldon.

11:28.052 --> 11:29.186
This is Howard and Raj.

11:29.187 --> 11:30.454
They work at the university, too.

11:30.455 --> 11:31.722
Hey. Hey.

11:31.723 --> 11:33.157
I'll get to you later.

11:34.092 --> 11:35.859
What are you sitting on?

11:35.860 --> 11:39.496
I can't speak for these guys,
but I'm sitting on my tushie.

11:40.832 --> 11:41.865
It's a joke.

11:41.866 --> 11:43.600
Not a good idea.

11:43.601 --> 11:45.536
"Tushie" is buttocks, right?

11:45.537 --> 11:48.572
Right. Hilarious.

11:48.573 --> 11:50.641
Explain the couch.

11:50.642 --> 11:51.775
Oh, well, there were some people

11:51.776 --> 11:53.010
on the first floor moving out,

11:53.011 --> 11:54.411
and they sold it to me for $100.

11:54.412 --> 11:56.046
Howard and Raj helped
me bring it up.

11:56.047 --> 11:59.049
But what's wrong with
the furniture we have?

11:59.050 --> 12:02.019
They're lawn chairs.

12:02.020 --> 12:03.720
And there was no place for company.

12:03.721 --> 12:07.391
Did it occur to you
that was by design?

12:07.392 --> 12:08.992
According to the
roommate agreement,

12:08.993 --> 12:10.694
I'm entitled to allocate 50%

12:10.695 --> 12:12.796
of the cubic footage
of the common areas.

12:12.797 --> 12:14.965
But you didn't notify me by e-mail,

12:14.966 --> 12:17.201
so this is still a breach.

12:17.202 --> 12:19.036
I did notify you.

12:19.037 --> 12:21.471
Oh, you did, did you?

12:36.187 --> 12:37.955
Oh, drat!

12:39.824 --> 12:43.026
Hoisted by my own spam filter.

12:43.027 --> 12:45.028
What am I doing in
your spam folder?

12:45.029 --> 12:46.663
I put you there after
you forwarded me

12:46.664 --> 12:48.365
a picture of a cat
playing the piano,

12:48.366 --> 12:49.900
entitled "This is funny."

12:50.768 --> 12:52.336
Oh, yeah, I saw that.

12:52.337 --> 12:54.538
That was hilarious.

12:54.539 --> 12:56.440
Okay, what does all this
have to do with the elevator?

12:56.441 --> 12:57.741
I'm getting to it.

12:57.742 --> 12:59.643
I assure you, you'll be sorry

12:59.644 --> 13:01.979
you wasted your money on an iPod

13:01.980 --> 13:04.815
when Microsoft comes
out with theirs.

13:06.517 --> 13:09.052
Okay, do you have an
opinion about everything?

13:09.053 --> 13:11.722
Yes.

13:11.723 --> 13:14.291
And you just assume
you're always right?

13:14.292 --> 13:16.860
It's not an assumption.

13:17.662 --> 13:19.296
Change seats with me.

13:19.297 --> 13:21.298
Why? I don't like this spot.

13:21.299 --> 13:23.033
I have to keep turning my head.

13:23.034 --> 13:24.835
Fine.

13:25.937 --> 13:27.804
Ooh, it's time for <i>Babylon 5!</i>

13:27.805 --> 13:30.407
We don't watch <i>Babylon 5</i>
in this apartment.

13:30.408 --> 13:31.475
Why not?

13:31.476 --> 13:33.610
Because no one likes <i>Babylon 5.</i>

13:33.611 --> 13:34.745
I like it.

13:34.746 --> 13:35.879
Me, too. So do I.

13:35.880 --> 13:37.447
There you go-- three against one.

13:37.448 --> 13:38.715
They don't get a vote.

13:38.716 --> 13:39.883
It's one against one.

13:39.884 --> 13:41.785
And according to the
roommate agreement,

13:41.786 --> 13:44.655
all ties will be settled by me.

13:44.656 --> 13:46.890
But I said no to that.

13:46.891 --> 13:49.092
And I said yes.

13:49.093 --> 13:51.795
And I settle all ties.

13:55.266 --> 13:56.933
Change seats with me.

13:56.934 --> 13:58.135
Why?

13:58.136 --> 13:59.636
There's a draft on
my neck over here.

13:59.637 --> 14:01.338
So, I get the draft?

14:01.339 --> 14:03.807
You're protected
by your turtleneck.

14:04.642 --> 14:06.343
Fine.

14:07.979 --> 14:10.180
And it's a dickey.

14:16.854 --> 14:19.556
Hmm...

14:19.557 --> 14:21.825
I'm still not comfortable.

14:21.826 --> 14:23.093
Of course.

14:23.094 --> 14:24.761
There's too many people here.

14:26.230 --> 14:27.531
We can fix that.

14:27.532 --> 14:29.399
Let's leave.

14:29.400 --> 14:31.735
Yeah, we can go over to my place.

14:31.736 --> 14:32.803
Wait.

14:32.804 --> 14:34.338
Let me get my jacket.

14:36.240 --> 14:38.608
You're not going with us. Why not?

14:38.609 --> 14:41.578
You're the guy we're
trying to get away from.

14:41.579 --> 14:43.246
Oh.

14:43.247 --> 14:45.782
Well, in that case,
I don't need my jacket.

14:47.018 --> 14:48.919
And for the record,
the correct syntax is:

14:48.920 --> 14:51.355
I'm the guy from whom
you're trying to get away.

15:00.431 --> 15:02.999
Oh, yes.

15:05.837 --> 15:08.772
This is definitely
going to be my spot.

15:08.773 --> 15:10.173
<i>Okay.</i>

15:10.174 --> 15:12.175
How do you know he said that?
You left the room.

15:12.176 --> 15:16.079
Hey, do you want me to finish
working on your man feet or not?

15:16.914 --> 15:19.349
Fine. Go ahead.

15:19.350 --> 15:22.586
MRS. WOLOWITZ Howard,
are you having a playdate?

15:22.587 --> 15:24.721
I don't have playdates!

15:24.722 --> 15:26.590
I have colleagues!

15:26.591 --> 15:30.227
Do their parents know they're here?

15:30.228 --> 15:34.064
No, but if you keep screaming,
maybe they'll hear you!

15:38.503 --> 15:40.070
That your dad?

15:42.306 --> 15:45.409
She grows any more
hair on her face, yes.

15:46.511 --> 15:47.677
Oh, man.

15:47.678 --> 15:49.713
Is that a two-stage rocket?

15:49.714 --> 15:52.416
Three. I designed
the engine myself.

15:52.417 --> 15:54.684
Cool. Can it break Mach 1?

15:54.685 --> 15:57.721
Oh, probably, if I could get
my hands on that new fuel

15:57.722 --> 15:59.656
the government's been working on.

15:59.657 --> 16:01.658
Oh, this just might
be your lucky day.

16:01.659 --> 16:03.860
MRS. WOLOWITZ: Howard,
what happened to the Oreos

16:03.861 --> 16:06.430
I left on the counter?!

16:07.832 --> 16:10.967
I haven't seen your Oreos!

16:10.968 --> 16:14.538
Just take your bath without them!

16:18.276 --> 16:19.976
So, why was it his lucky day?

16:19.977 --> 16:20.977
Well, it turns out I had

16:20.978 --> 16:22.245
a little rocket fuel
in the apartment.

16:22.246 --> 16:24.948
What were you doing with
rocket fuel in your apartment?

16:24.949 --> 16:26.650
Mm, Joyce Kim was kind of curious

16:26.651 --> 16:28.251
about what I did for a living,

16:28.252 --> 16:31.121
and I was going to
kind of show it to her.

16:32.857 --> 16:34.090
It's not important. The point is,

16:34.091 --> 16:36.126
the guys and I went
back to the apartment.

16:36.127 --> 16:37.694
Are we ever going to
get to the elevator?

16:37.695 --> 16:38.728
Yeah, we're really close.

16:38.729 --> 16:39.930
Uh, uh, we're at the apartment.

16:39.931 --> 16:42.065
The trick is to mix it into Tovex

16:42.066 --> 16:43.900
in order to create
a combustible gel

16:43.901 --> 16:46.970
that will generate over 8,
000 kilonewtons of thrust.

16:46.971 --> 16:48.104
Cool. Nice.

16:48.105 --> 16:49.406
Won't work.

16:50.708 --> 16:53.343
Excuse me, but I've been
working on this a long time.

16:53.344 --> 16:54.678
Trust me-- it'll work.

16:54.679 --> 16:56.780
You don't see your mistake, do you?

16:56.781 --> 16:58.381
There's no mistake.

16:58.382 --> 17:01.117
This is for a full-scale rocket,
not a model.

17:01.118 --> 17:02.752
Well, I've adjusted the formula.

17:02.753 --> 17:05.021
Not correctly.

17:05.021 --> 17:06.990
Okay, I've had it with you.

17:06.991 --> 17:08.758
You might be an expert

17:08.759 --> 17:10.627
on theoretical physics and
science-fiction programs

17:10.627 --> 17:12.929
and where to sit on
a freaking couch,

17:12.930 --> 17:14.731
but this is applied physics.

17:14.732 --> 17:18.335
And when it comes to
applied physic... uh-oh.

17:18.336 --> 17:19.502
What's happening?

17:19.503 --> 17:21.304
A bad thing. A very bad thing.

17:21.305 --> 17:22.372
Get the door.

17:22.373 --> 17:23.874
Get the door! Get the door!

17:23.875 --> 17:26.242
Get the door! Get the door!

17:35.987 --> 17:38.355
You're waiting for the elevator?!

17:38.356 --> 17:40.223
Oh. Right.

17:40.224 --> 17:41.791
Wait. It's here.

17:46.230 --> 17:47.964
Give me that.

17:51.402 --> 17:53.136
What'd you do that for?
I had plenty of time...

17:58.509 --> 18:00.443
You're welcome.

18:03.314 --> 18:05.181
Not only did Sheldon save my life,

18:05.182 --> 18:07.017
he didn't rat me out
to the landlord.

18:07.018 --> 18:08.184
Or the police.

18:08.185 --> 18:10.487
Or Homeland Security.

18:10.488 --> 18:12.355
Okay, so, basically,
you're the reason

18:12.356 --> 18:15.191
I have to walk up and down three
flights of stairs every day?

18:15.192 --> 18:16.459
So I did something stupid.

18:16.460 --> 18:18.495
I'm sure you did stupid
things when you were younger.

18:18.496 --> 18:20.030
What were you doing
seven years ago?

18:20.031 --> 18:21.665
Excuse me, I was in high school.

18:21.666 --> 18:23.700
Studying, keeping my nose clean,

18:23.701 --> 18:25.835
doing volunteer work
for the community.

18:28.306 --> 18:30.674
Not pregnant.

18:30.675 --> 18:32.842
Yes!

18:38.853 --> 18:41.088
Oh, Ubuntu,

18:41.089 --> 18:45.259
you are my favorite
Linux-based operating system.

18:45.260 --> 18:46.427
Hey.

18:46.428 --> 18:48.429
Hello.

18:49.697 --> 18:51.598
Why do I smell methacrylate?

18:51.599 --> 18:53.267
Oh, uh, clear nail polish.

18:53.268 --> 18:54.868
I had a mani-pedi.

18:55.737 --> 18:57.771
Men can get those.

18:59.007 --> 19:00.741
Anyway, I may owe you an apology.

19:00.742 --> 19:03.977
There's doubt?

19:03.978 --> 19:05.679
I did agree to the
thermostat setting,

19:05.680 --> 19:07.815
and I shouldn't have
tried to change it.

19:07.816 --> 19:09.683
That's not an apology.

19:09.684 --> 19:12.853
Simply an acknowledgement
that I was right.

19:12.854 --> 19:14.087
Okay, I'm sorry.

19:14.088 --> 19:15.956
There you go.

19:15.957 --> 19:17.291
So, we're good?

19:17.292 --> 19:20.160
Good what?

19:20.161 --> 19:21.762
Never mind.

19:21.763 --> 19:23.730
Okay if I watch some TV?

19:23.731 --> 19:25.499
Go ahead.

19:25.500 --> 19:27.835
<i>Up next</i> Babylon 5.

19:29.504 --> 19:31.538
You're not even watching!

19:31.539 --> 19:32.773
I can hear it!

19:32.774 --> 19:34.708
Oh, so the dialogue offends you?

19:34.709 --> 19:36.910
I would hardly call that dialogue!

19:36.911 --> 19:38.378
You're insane, you know that?!

19:38.379 --> 19:40.080
Don't make me turn
that flag upside down,

19:40.081 --> 19:41.682
'cause you know I'll do it!
