JERRY: July eighth, 1979...

00:20.229 --> 00:24.109
all the fathers of Nobel Prize
winners were rounded up...

00:24.274 --> 00:26.868
By United Nations military
units, all right?

00:27.027 --> 00:29.200
...and actually
forced at gunpoint...

00:29.363 --> 00:32.366
to give semen samples
in little plastic jars...

00:32.533 --> 00:37.004
which are now stored below Rockefeller
Center, underneath the ice skating rink.

00:37.162 --> 00:40.507

strengthens your teeth!

00:50.300 --> 00:53.520
That's ridiculous! You know
what this stuff does to you?

00:53.679 --> 00:55.977
It actually weakens your will...

00:56.139 --> 00:59.939
takes away the capacity for
free and creative thought...

01:00.102 --> 01:02.275
and makes you a slave to the state.

01:04.772 --> 01:09.449
Ever wonder about all these militia groups,
survivalist-type kooks on the right-wing side?

01:09.611 --> 01:13.332
They say that they're defending
the country from the U.N. troops.

01:13.490 --> 01:18.041

is... And this is a conspiracy, pal.

01:18.245 --> 01:20.213

that's terrible news."

Isn't there anything you can do
for me, doc? Three minutes?"

01:43.562 --> 01:46.156

"Well, I can boil you an egg."

or "Drive cars." I mean, it's real generic.

and as ex-director of the CIA...

Oh, come on. Six major earthquakes in three
and a half years and the space shuttle...

19:56.278 --> 19:59.327
up in orbit for every one. Don't
you think that's strange?

19:59.490 --> 20:01.618
Testing some top-secret
seismic weapon?

20:01.784 --> 20:05.209
No! No. Not testing. Using.
Nukes are passe. We're...

20:05.371 --> 20:06.773

The president's in Europe...
Hi. Europe at the moment.

20:12.128 --> 20:14.472
And, uh, tomorrow he'll be, uh...

20:14.630 --> 20:17.679

along this fault line.

20:17.842 --> 20:20.265

shuttle yesterday.

20:22.596 --> 20:25.019
How about $50 billion?
How's that for a motive?

20:25.975 --> 20:28.728
Oh. Oh, here, let me get that.

20:28.894 --> 20:33.320
The president's cutting funding to NASA,
the milk cow of the aerospace industry.

20:33.482 --> 20:38.158
ALICE: So you're telling me that NASA's going
to kill the president with an earthquake?

20:38.571 --> 20:41.199
- Do you still ride?
- Not for years.

20:41.365 --> 20:44.369
Why do you keep the picture of you?
Kind of wish you hadn't quit?

20:44.535 --> 20:46.537

- What? Oh.

20:46.704 --> 20:48.672

Yes, Jerry, that's her job.
Now I have to go.

21:02.136 --> 21:03.979
My boss is looking to yell at me.

21:04.138 --> 21:06.857
Do you want me to talk to him,
smooth things out for you?

21:07.016 --> 21:10.020
No, I want you to go home or
wherever it is that you go.

21:10.186 --> 21:13.486
And I want you to make an appointment.
You can't just keep bursting in.

21:13.689 --> 21:15.783
No, no. It's just what
they'd be expecting.

21:15.941 --> 21:18.069

Okay, deal. So are
you gonna warn him?

21:34.001 --> 21:35.719
Who?

21:35.878 --> 21:37.630
The president.

21:37.880 --> 21:39.553
I'm not gonna promise you anything.

You think I'm crazy.
She thinks I'm crazy.

you're different.

I... I can remember you.

I remember you.

I'll remember in the

What is it? What is it?
I told them...

35:14.613 --> 35:16.707
- No, what is it?
- Something to help you sleep.

35:16.865 --> 35:19.664
I don't... Agh! I don't want
to sleep, I want to check out.

Why am I handcuffed to this bed?
I'm not a criminal. Please, help!

Alice, you gotta get me out of here.
They gave me some stuff.

- You're under arrest.
- What?

35:29.461 --> 35:31.304
What's...? What's the charge?

35:31.463 --> 35:33.807
- Jerry, you were there. Figure it out.
- Oh, Jesus.

If you remember who stabbed
you with the wheelchair...

35:36.635 --> 35:39.388

- Wheelchair, right.

explain it so it all made sense.

35:43.642 --> 35:47.112

You got to switch the charts.

35:49.189 --> 35:52.318
Switch my charts with that guy's

35:52.484 --> 35:56.830
Don't make me repeat myself. Please,
switch my chart or I'll be dead by morning.

35:56.988 --> 36:00.413
- I swear.
- Relax. Go to sleep. I'll see you tomorrow.

36:00.575 --> 36:02.998
- You want to bet?
- You're just being paranoid.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.004
Only paranoid because
they want me dead.

- Guy came in with a stab wound...

36:56.965 --> 36:59.218
and died of a heart attack.
Go figure.

37:03.346 --> 37:04.689
- You Miss Sutton?
- Yes.

37:04.848 --> 37:07.271
They want me to bring
you downstairs.

37:07.434 --> 37:08.731
Who does?

37:08.893 --> 37:12.898
The FBI, the CIA. You name the
initials, they're down there.

37:13.064 --> 37:14.907
Any special reason?

37:15.066 --> 37:17.615
They said to bring you and
the body to the basement.

37:17.777 --> 37:20.280
And the body's on its
way, so come with me.

37:20.447 --> 37:21.915

Thank you.

37:38.590 --> 37:40.183
For what?

37:40.925 --> 37:42.848
For switching the charts.

37:43.428 --> 37:45.977
I didn't switch the charts.

37:46.514 --> 37:50.815
No, it's okay. The guy, he traded bullets
with an old man in a liquor store.

37:50.977 --> 37:52.524
He had it coming.

37:52.687 --> 37:55.987
You expect me to believe that
someone came in here last night...

37:56.149 --> 37:58.652
and gave that guy something
that stopped his heart?

37:59.569 --> 38:01.742
You switched the
charts, you tell me.

38:06.910 --> 38:08.378
I've got to go downstairs, now.

38:08.536 --> 38:11.631
- The CIA wants to see your body.
- Really?

38:14.000 --> 38:16.799
I won't be here when you
get back. I'll keep in touch.

38:16.961 --> 38:19.510
You're handcuffed
to the bed, Jerry.

38:19.672 --> 38:24.098

38:41.569 --> 38:43.242
I didn't switch the charts.

38:44.906 --> 38:46.408
JERRY: Yeah, you did.

38:46.574 --> 38:50.124
You switched them.
You switched the charts.

38:52.455 --> 38:55.629
Let's see here. This is
a grueling experience.

39:02.006 --> 39:03.258
Put that out!

problems to be cleared.

- Tell me about it.

39:15.270 --> 39:18.399
Police want him for assault.
Secret Service for counterfeiting.

39:18.565 --> 39:20.988
We're tracking him on a
string of bank robberies.

39:21.150 --> 39:23.699
No one knows what the
CIA wants him for.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.700
This guy's a CIA shrink,
he's here to ID Fletcher.

39:28.867 --> 39:32.121
- They knew each other somehow.
- Take off the sheet.

So Jerry thinks that NASA is
plotting to kill the president?

where Jerry lives?

Jerry won't talk to anyone but you.

you?

How charming.

45:01.699 --> 45:02.996
He has great taste.

45:03.868 --> 45:04.994
Now, why him?

45:05.161 --> 45:08.335
Why do you, uh, tolerate
his visits to your office?

45:10.625 --> 45:15.131
About six months ago, I was leaving
work and two guys tried to mug me.

45:15.713 --> 45:19.058
Jerry came out of nowhere and
rescued me. That's how I met him.

something about Jerry that...

to tell him to get lost.

him when he shot John Lennon.

I was just thinking that.

Remember the guy that
shot Reagan? John Hinckley?

46:42.842 --> 46:45.516

Didn't know what to do.

48:26.779 --> 48:30.534
- How'd you know this was my car?
- I didn't. It was a lucky guess.

48:30.699 --> 48:33.498
Look, I feel kind of naked.
Could we get out of here?

48:33.661 --> 48:37.757

I was here all day.

48:53.889 --> 48:57.735
That's how long it takes to turn a hospital
inside-out. There are people after you.

48:58.769 --> 49:02.740
They'll put me in the same place as
Oswald. Another lunatic acting alone.

49:03.315 --> 49:06.660
Oswald killed the president. Is
that what you're planning to do?

49:06.819 --> 49:09.038
No. Did you call him about
the earthquake thing?

49:09.196 --> 49:10.413
- Warn him?
- I'll do that.

49:10.573 --> 49:14.874
- Can you sit up so I can see you?
- No. No. I don't want them to see me.

49:15.035 --> 49:17.129
- Them who?
- Them back there.

it from, they'd actually let him do it?

disinformation junkie for him.

says it all. He should be dead.

is, um, an unprovable one.

up somewhere along the line.

The latest casualty in the whole fiasco
is one of the richest men in America:

01:21:43.774 --> 01:21:46.072
Ernest Harriman.

01:21:47.111 --> 01:21:48.283
He was murdered.

01:21:48.445 --> 01:21:49.992
- Murdered?
- Here in Manhattan.

01:21:50.155 --> 01:21:52.533
No, Jerry, I read in the
paper, he was, um...

01:21:52.699 --> 01:21:56.169
He drowned in a swimming pool. It
was an accident, it was in Newport.

01:21:56.328 --> 01:22:00.174
No. Nobody dies in Newport. They couldn't
even kill Sunny Von Bulow in Newport.

01:22:00.332 --> 01:22:02.175
He drowned, but not in Newport.

01:22:02.334 --> 01:22:03.836
ALICE: Where, then?

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:09.224
Right here, the 7th
Street subway station.

01:22:09.383 --> 01:22:12.978
A billionaire waiting on the subway?
Why didn't they drown him in his limo?

01:22:13.137 --> 01:22:16.562
No, don't you read the papers?
I mean, don't you watch television? Huh?

01:22:16.723 --> 01:22:18.691
Last week, this place
was under water.

01:22:18.851 --> 01:22:20.819
- A water main broke.
- I know.

01:22:20.978 --> 01:22:24.278
But you know what's right above
this area? The Harriman Building.

01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:28.286
The whole substructure was flooded.
I'm telling you, he didn't drown in a pool.

01:22:28.444 --> 01:22:31.323
Call the, uh, coroner in Rhode
Island or wherever it was...

01:22:31.488 --> 01:22:33.866
and ask if he had chlorinated
water in his lungs.

01:22:34.032 --> 01:22:36.000
- Okay, I will.
- You will?

01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:37.707

- I...

01:22:44.918 --> 01:22:47.262

you'll marry me...

01:22:52.843 --> 01:22:54.720

hold of the first thing I could think.

Yes, we should. It's Geronimo.

gives you insight.

you wouldn't normally...

Years ago...

01:26:47.911 --> 01:26:51.290
I worked for the Central
Intelligence Agency...

01:26:51.581 --> 01:26:55.176
on the MK ULTRA program.
Are you familiar with it?

01:26:56.211 --> 01:26:58.009
It was mind control.
