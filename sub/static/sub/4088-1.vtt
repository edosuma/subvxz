Oh, look, that's our school,

07:58.310 --> 07:59.834
Madam Olga Kirowa International Ballet.

08:02.047 --> 08:02.911

08:04.717 --> 08:05.706
You don't meanto say you're adancer.

Yes.

08:06.886 --> 08:07.818
Ah... professional dancer?

08:08.387 --> 08:09.911
Now and then I wonder.

08:11.290 --> 08:13.758
You mean you can very well nodor something

08:14.059 --> 08:15.526
Certainly, I can do auto-sante

08:17.062 --> 08:17.721
I beg you pardon?

08:18.164 --> 08:20.064
I can cross my feet six times in mid-air

08:20.399 --> 08:21.366
It just could do ten

08:21.700 --> 08:23.224
but that only happen once in the Century.

08:24.603 --> 08:25.433
Must because of the muscle's of...

08:26.205 --> 08:27.365
Let's forget of the muscle.

08:28.507 --> 08:30.668
I should thinkof the
dancer'smuscle be like strong man.

08:31.143 --> 08:32.610
Oh, not quietly, that'll be restrictful.

08:32.945 --> 08:34.469
We tryto combine the slender and strength

08:35.080 --> 08:37.014
Well, I've been dancing
since I was 12, and...

08:38.116 --> 08:39.640
I don't think the muscle is over-developed?

08:40.285 --> 08:42.049
Oh... no, not in your case.

08:42.621 --> 08:43.918
Cause we have to trainlike gasoline

08:44.323 --> 08:45.950

08:46.826 --> 08:48.088
You'reexpected to be in the theater tonight?

08:48.527 --> 08:49.858
We don't go onuntil ten.

08:51.630 --> 08:52.289
Wish Icould be there.

08:52.898 --> 08:53.557
Why don't you come?

08:54.533 --> 08:56.125
No, unfortunately I have journal's dinner.

08:56.735 --> 08:58.362
Takes a lot of nerves
to miss journal's dinner.

08:59.271 --> 09:00.067
Are you home on leave?

09:00.272 --> 09:00.567
I haven't.

09:00.806 --> 09:01.795
My home is in Scotland

09:02.208 --> 09:03.835

fascinationof the unknown.

09:20.392 --> 09:21.450

Oh, very attempting, but...

09:45.517 --> 09:46.541

Shall I carry that?

09:48.520 --> 09:48.918
No, no!

09:49.088 --> 09:50.749

09:53.592 --> 09:55.219
It isn't very like it, isn't it?

09:55.694 --> 09:56.661
You goback toFrance.

09:57.029 --> 09:57.393
And you...

09:58.163 --> 09:59.130
We maygo to America.

09:59.798 --> 10:00.730
That does makeit unlikely.

10:01.834 --> 10:02.129
I'm sorry.

10:03.769 --> 10:04.861
So am I.

10:12.177 --> 10:12.541

12:49.368 --> 12:49.857

12:50.202 --> 12:50.998

12:51.804 --> 12:52.862

16:29.021 --> 16:32.286
I cannot bear just spend my last
evening with my corneal afterall,

16:32.457 --> 16:34.391
Pleasehave supper with me,

16:34.693 --> 16:35.921
Your friend inthe Shelter

16:37.029 --> 16:39.930
P. S. I am sure you would
because I have a good luck charm

16:40.332 --> 16:41.629
which had already change my luck.

16:42.234 --> 16:42.791
And the signature?

16:43.935 --> 16:44.526
There isn't one.

16:45.137 --> 16:46.001
And if there were one.

16:46.705 --> 16:47.399
What would it be?

16:48.240 --> 16:50.071
I don't know, I only know his last name.

16:50.575 --> 16:51.041
Indeed!

16:52.077 --> 16:52.736
I mustemphasize.

16:53.445 --> 16:56.539
That if you want sub-parties, officers,

16:56.748 --> 16:58.978
and atthe last, you shouldn'tbe here with me,

16:59.484 --> 17:00.712
but inother occupation.

17:02.988 --> 17:04.421
Lydia, paper, please.

17:06.858 --> 17:09.884
A wordis no excuse for in thequarrel.

And write, please,

17:22.874 --> 17:23.636

17:27.913 --> 17:28.675
Dear Captain,

17:39.925 --> 17:40.687

17:55.207 --> 17:57.141
Oh, captain, captain.

17:58.043 --> 18:00.409
Captain, I'm kitty, Myra's friend.

18:00.645 --> 18:01.441
Where do you like to meet her?

18:01.613 --> 18:03.080
What? Myra?

18:03.348 --> 18:04.679
Oh, how do youdo?

18:04.950 --> 18:05.541
I do very well, thank you.

18:05.717 --> 18:06.945
But where do you want to meet her?

18:07.486 --> 18:07.918
I...

18:08.687 --> 18:09.711
But she... uh... she refuse...

18:10.088 --> 18:10.713
Oh, take your note.

18:10.889 --> 18:12.413
There's an olddrag made her to write that

18:12.624 --> 18:13.488
You mean she'll come after all?

18:13.658 --> 18:14.352
Name the place.

18:14.860 --> 18:16.384
Does she know the candle night's club?

18:16.561 --> 18:17.255
No, but I do.

18:17.429 --> 18:17.690
Good, then...

18:18.163 --> 18:19.221
Then I'll be there, anhour, say?

18:19.598 --> 18:20.292
An hour.

18:21.233 --> 18:21.631
Look, here...

18:21.800 --> 18:23.995
I... I hope I'mdoing the rightthing.

18:25.270 --> 18:26.294
Myra'sjust a sweet child

18:26.805 --> 18:27.794
You can see that, can't you?

18:30.509 --> 18:32.500
I can see that, Kitty.

18:35.447 --> 18:36.072
Bye-bye, captain.

19:09.948 --> 19:11.006
Hello

19:11.216 --> 19:12.205
Oh! Hello

19:13.452 --> 19:16.114
I'm afraid that Kitty direct
you to the wrong place.

19:16.288 --> 19:16.652
Oh no!

19:17.088 --> 19:19.215
But I read theletter before the wholeclass.

19:20.192 --> 19:20.920
Were you embarrassed?

19:21.460 --> 19:23.121
Yes, so would you, I believe?

19:23.528 --> 19:24.187
Mh... Idare say.

19:24.729 --> 19:25.991
I'm afraid I made it difficult for you?

19:26.731 --> 19:28.358
Well, you... you gave up the corneal,

19:28.733 --> 19:30.428
so I spend a time
verydifficult to see you too.

19:30.635 --> 19:32.000
Yes sure you did, but I have my reward.

19:32.471 --> 19:33.597
It's wonderfulto have you to come.

19:34.072 --> 19:34.538
Shall we go in?

19:34.873 --> 19:35.202
All right.

19:54.392 --> 19:55.290
Excuseme!

19:56.995 --> 19:57.757
How nice you look!

19:59.064 --> 19:59.587
Thank you!

20:02.434 --> 20:04.231
Mm... what a dancer eat?

20:04.970 --> 20:07.905
Oh, dancing... mostly
netruous yet not fattening

20:08.073 --> 20:09.097
Oh, no... not tonight.

20:09.741 --> 20:13.142
What do you suggest would be
particularly richand inadjustable?

20:13.545 --> 20:15.137
The crab is very nice, sir

20:15.447 --> 20:17.915
And wine, thisbegins against the rule,

20:18.149 --> 20:19.707
but dancer does drink a
littlelight wine, isn't it?

20:19.885 --> 20:20.214
Well, tonight?

20:20.452 --> 20:20.679
Good!

20:20.852 --> 20:21.341
No. 14,please.

20:21.653 --> 20:22.950
No 14,sir.

20:24.089 --> 20:25.556
The ballet wasbeautiful!

20:26.191 --> 20:27.385
Madamedidn't think so.

20:27.559 --> 20:28.423
Well, experts never know.

20:28.960 --> 20:31.155
It takes outsider to know
whenl tell you it was beautiful.

20:31.596 --> 20:33.120
That certainlyproves you are an outsider.

20:35.867 --> 20:36.799
You'd like to see me again.

20:37.769 --> 20:38.326
Yes.

20:40.071 --> 20:41.095
I sense reservation.

20:43.241 --> 20:44.367
Well, I suppose there is one.

20:44.543 --> 20:45.009
What?

20:45.377 --> 20:45.775
Why?

20:46.811 --> 20:47.539
What'sthe good ofit?

20:49.814 --> 20:50.838
You are a strange girl, aren't you?

20:51.783 --> 20:52.408
What'sthe good of everything?

20:52.584 --> 20:53.608
What'sthe good ofliving?

20:53.885 --> 20:54.647
That'sa question, too.

20:55.487 --> 20:57.421
Oh, no, wait aminute. I'm
notlet youget away with that.

20:58.823 --> 21:00.984
One of the thing aboutliving is
this sort of things can happen.

21:01.726 --> 21:03.159
The shadow of desperate,

21:03.628 --> 21:05.528
I can meet youand feel more intenselyalive,

21:05.897 --> 21:08.457
and walking around in the peace
time, taking my life for granted.

21:08.833 --> 21:10.095
It's high price to pay for it.

21:11.002 --> 21:11.491
I don't think so.

21:11.870 --> 21:12.393
I do.

21:13.238 --> 21:16.571
Do people haveto killeach other
to give thema hiking sense oflife?

21:18.310 --> 21:20.005
That'sgot nothing to do with
people killing each other.

21:20.745 --> 21:22.406
Are you excited about life or you're not?

21:23.415 --> 21:25.383
You know, I'venever been
ableto wait for the future.

21:26.518 --> 21:28.247
When I was very young, a childin fact,

21:29.087 --> 21:31.681
I climb to thetop branch of
ahigh tree to like a diver,

21:31.923 --> 21:34.858
announce my horrify governance, now
I shall take a leave into the future

21:35.226 --> 21:36.056
and I jump.

21:37.596 --> 21:38.494
I was in the hospital two months.

21:39.864 --> 21:41.855
You should letthe future
catch up youmore slowly.

21:42.534 --> 21:44.434
Oh, no, can't help it, I can'thelp it.

21:45.370 --> 21:47.930
O. K., if we met in ordinary
time withordinary way,

21:48.206 --> 21:50.572
we're just about telling
what school we went to.

21:54.546 --> 21:56.207
We're much further along, don't you think?

21:57.749 --> 21:58.147
Are we?

22:00.385 --> 22:01.181
You know we are.

22:03.288 --> 22:04.653
Oh! I'm too excited, let's dance?

22:04.889 --> 22:05.321
All right!

22:22.207 --> 22:23.105
To you!

22:23.708 --> 22:24.003
Thank you!

22:24.976 --> 22:25.340
To us!

22:30.982 --> 22:32.347
I still don't get enough quite.

22:32.584 --> 22:33.676
What?

22:34.519 --> 22:35.486
Your face.

22:36.021 --> 22:37.352
It's all beauty, all beauty.

22:38.657 --> 22:39.885
What is it youstill don't get?

22:42.761 --> 22:43.887
You know when I left you this afternoon.

22:44.062 --> 22:46.155
I couldn't remember what you
look like, not for the life of me.

22:47.198 --> 22:48.426
I thought was she pretty?

22:48.867 --> 22:49.663
Was she ugly?

22:50.001 --> 22:50.433
What was she like?

22:50.602 --> 22:51.796
I couldn't remember.

22:52.170 --> 22:54.263
I simply had to go getback tothe
theater to see whatdoes she look like?

22:55.407 --> 22:56.635
And do you think you can remember me now?

22:59.110 --> 23:03.046
I think so. I think so.

23:04.416 --> 23:05.246
For the rest of my life.

23:09.387 --> 23:11.378
But what is itall about the
muse you still don't get?

23:14.459 --> 23:15.084
Ladiesand gentlemen,

23:15.326 --> 23:17.226
we nowcome tothe last dance of the evening.

23:17.829 --> 23:19.922
I hope you enjoy the farewell waltz.

23:20.732 --> 23:22.063
I'll tell you later, let's dance now.

23:23.968 --> 23:25.162
What does thismean of these candles?

23:25.637 --> 23:26.365
You'll find out.

26:15.673 --> 26:16.139
I'll write to you.

26:16.674 --> 26:17.504
Will you answer?

26:18.142 --> 26:18.631
Of course.

26:20.378 --> 26:21.276
Wonderfully evening, wasn't it?

26:22.247 --> 26:23.305
Yes, thank you very much.

26:24.549 --> 26:26.517
When Icome back, we'll go there again.

26:27.218 --> 26:27.843
Yes.

26:28.419 --> 26:29.215
There'll be our place.

26:29.621 --> 26:31.282
That's where we're always
re-catch this evening.

26:33.591 --> 26:34.785
You think we'll ever seen eachother again?

26:36.227 --> 26:37.524
I think it's startful, don't you?.

26:39.230 --> 26:40.288
Yes, Isupposeit is.

26:42.166 --> 26:43.895
What was that you started
to tell me in the restaurant

26:44.068 --> 26:45.695
you didn't understand about me?

26:47.338 --> 26:48.999
Mm..., no use to go into now.

26:49.707 --> 26:51.607
Pleasetell me, I would like to know.

26:53.511 --> 26:56.139
Well, it strikes me curious
ever sincel meet you,

26:56.381 --> 26:58.872
you know, veryearly moment ages ago.

26:59.918 --> 27:03.354
That you're so young, so
lovely, so defeat-ages...

27:03.821 --> 27:05.880
You don't seemto respect much from life?

27:07.191 --> 27:07.919
Well, is that right?

27:09.394 --> 27:12.158
For instance, I meet you, I like you.

27:13.398 --> 27:14.922
And I assume so soon we'll apart,

27:15.300 --> 27:17.165
perhaps we'll never see each other again.

27:18.269 --> 27:19.395
You can't conceive that then.

27:19.704 --> 27:20.898
I'll never seeeach other again.

27:21.873 --> 27:23.465
Yes, Ican't.

27:27.345 --> 27:28.175
This where youlive.

27:28.746 --> 27:29.269
Yes.

27:30.949 --> 27:32.246
Nothing to do about it, does it?

27:33.351 --> 27:35.182
Nothing... except to say good bye.

27:36.321 --> 27:36.912
I suppose so.

27:38.623 --> 27:39.180
Good bye.

27:39.991 --> 27:40.787
Good bye, Myradear.

27:42.393 --> 27:43.223
Good bye, Roy.

27:44.729 --> 27:45.252
Keep well!

27:46.030 --> 27:47.361
Yes, you too, Keep well!

27:48.366 --> 27:50.231
Mh... nothing can happen to me.

27:50.969 --> 27:52.596
Your lucky charm will see you then.

27:53.237 --> 27:53.669
I hopeit will.

27:53.838 --> 27:54.862
I'll prey it will.

27:56.674 --> 27:57.072
Good bye!

27:57.742 --> 27:58.674
Good bye!

28:02.947 --> 28:03.845
Pleaseleave me first.

28:06.150 --> 28:06.616
All right.

28:52.563 --> 28:54.030
Ah, I wish I can have this catch amended.

28:54.532 --> 28:55.760
What I've beentelling you?

28:57.402 --> 28:58.494
It broken opentwice yesterday.

29:03.007 --> 29:04.065
Oh! Kitty, What time is it?

29:04.776 --> 29:06.869
It's... almost 11.

29:08.379 --> 29:08.845
Oh!

29:13.284 --> 29:14.273
Good morning, Madame!

29:14.752 --> 29:15.184
Good morning!

29:17.055 --> 29:18.750
I cometo congraduate you, Myra.

29:19.223 --> 29:20.087
What? Madame.

29:20.491 --> 29:21.617
On-being up. Myra.

29:21.926 --> 29:25.293
Considering that you didn't
goto bed until 4,it's remarkable.

29:26.731 --> 29:28.722
I havethe feeling your performance tonight

29:29.233 --> 29:31.565
will give the effect of sleep walking.

29:32.136 --> 29:33.694
That'sthe first time Myra's been out, Madam?

29:34.539 --> 29:37.167
When Imade you to send the
note to the Military gentleman.

29:37.642 --> 29:40.668
It was you I was trying to protect.

29:41.579 --> 29:43.444
I'm fond of the girls who work for me

29:44.048 --> 29:46.881
I don't want them to be camp followers.

29:47.685 --> 29:49.050
You don't knowhim or you wouldn't saythat.

29:49.454 --> 29:51.183
Can't we have any private lifeat all?

29:51.956 --> 29:54.652
Not when it cost your public clever theater.

29:55.760 --> 29:58.354
I'm happy thathe didn't stay here fora week.

29:58.996 --> 30:02.090
Otherwise he would ruin six
performances instead of one.

30:02.867 --> 30:06.325
If such thing should happened
again with you or any of the others,

30:07.038 --> 30:09.006
It means instant dismissal

30:12.376 --> 30:17.109
I willsee youat the theater tonight,
ifit is not too much trouble.

30:25.990 --> 30:28.788
Oh... Why she'sso curland hateful.

30:29.193 --> 30:30.353
Ah, the old booster...

30:30.728 --> 30:31.820
She talks always like that.

30:33.197 --> 30:33.993
Never mind.

30:34.665 --> 30:35.632
Spoil everything.

30:36.167 --> 30:37.395
Oh, rubbish!

30:38.302 --> 30:39.360
You'reupset and tired.

30:39.704 --> 30:41.331
Why don't you go to bed?

30:41.506 --> 30:42.370
There's no rehearsal today.

30:43.407 --> 30:44.203
No, I'm not tired.

30:47.645 --> 30:49.272
Horrible morning for the JameyCrossby.

30:49.947 --> 30:50.971
I suppose he'sgone now.

30:51.782 --> 30:53.010
Yeah, I suppose so.

31:13.804 --> 31:15.066
Kitty, Kitty, Look!

31:15.306 --> 31:16.000
He's there.

31:17.341 --> 31:19.400
Here is sergeant.

31:19.710 --> 31:20.438
Kitty, thanks God!

31:20.611 --> 31:20.872
He's here!

31:21.045 --> 31:22.512
He'll be called Marshall for this

31:22.680 --> 31:23.612
Oh, I gotta go, I gotta to!

31:24.148 --> 31:24.807
Oh, calm down, will you?

31:24.982 --> 31:27.382
He would certainly understand
it takesa while, Myra.

31:27.552 --> 31:29.349
Oh, Kitty, youspeak to him too, don't you?

31:29.520 --> 31:30.782
Well, that certainly goes to bring himup.

31:31.022 --> 31:32.819
Oh, get away to that
window, you stupid thing...

No family opposition.

41:34.057 --> 41:34.489
Not asexpected.

41:35.159 --> 41:35.523
Disappointed?

41:55.646 --> 41:56.112
Really?

41:56.480 --> 41:57.208
Of course, St. Matthew's.

41:57.581 --> 41:59.412
They have proper tradition
with rigid mental marriages,

41:59.583 --> 42:04.987
where walk-in many strangers
and walk out couple friends...

42:16.066 --> 42:17.556
The door beyond is thechest, sir.

It's been so quick...

42:38.322 --> 42:40.222
Are you quite, quite sure?

42:41.925 --> 42:44.086
Myra, I was never so
sure anything in my life.

42:45.395 --> 42:46.453
In themoment you leftme after the air ray.

42:46.797 --> 42:48.458
I knewl must find youagain, quickly.

42:50.234 --> 42:51.462
I found you, I'll never let you go.

42:53.337 --> 42:53.996
Does that answer you?

43:07.484 --> 43:08.109
Wait here.

43:46.056 --> 43:46.715
This is Miss Lester.

43:47.424 --> 43:48.448
How do you do, Miss Lester.

43:48.692 --> 43:49.215
How do you do.

43:49.660 --> 43:51.389
I am sorry to disappoint you, Miss Lester.

43:51.695 --> 43:54.391
But I'm afraidthat it's
impossible for me to merry you now.

43:55.532 --> 43:57.693
Do don't you forget that
according to the law,

43:58.268 --> 44:00.532
no marriage can take
place after threeo'clock.

44:01.438 --> 44:02.735
I explain to the Deacon, Myra.

44:02.940 --> 44:03.998
That the this is the emergency,

44:04.441 --> 44:06.875
we thought during war time,
something could bemanaged...

44:08.211 --> 44:09.178
Isn't there really
anything you could do, sir?

44:09.379 --> 44:10.437
We'll pay our most grateful.

44:10.714 --> 44:11.544
I'd like to help you.

44:12.249 --> 44:13.807
But unfortunately, that is law.

44:14.952 --> 44:17.512
However, if you would come
tomorrow morning at11 time,

44:18.255 --> 44:20.917
I shall be most happy to
purfome the ceremony for you.

44:21.291 --> 44:22.258
But wehave solittle of time.

44:23.794 --> 44:25.489
Well, there are only few hours.

44:25.762 --> 44:28.595
I justmeans we'll have to
be engaged for a whole day.

44:30.233 --> 44:32.633
I don't believe long
engagement, do you, Deacon?

44:33.470 --> 44:34.903
Oh, not when the partyare elder.

44:35.906 --> 44:38.374
But I think in your case, it can do noharm.

44:39.443 --> 44:41.274
Then Ishould expect you tomorrow at eleven.

44:41.812 --> 44:42.210
We'll be here.

44:42.379 --> 44:43.437
11 precisely.

44:43.613 --> 44:44.545
We'll stroke the hours.

44:44.915 --> 44:45.745

44:46.249 --> 44:47.375
Good bye, thank you very much.

44:47.551 --> 44:48.381

44:48.552 --> 44:49.075
Good bye, deacon.

44:59.596 --> 45:00.426
Where's Myra, anyhow?

45:00.664 --> 45:01.892
No more date, we've got to go to the theater.

45:02.566 --> 45:03.965
I'll tell, I just tremble for the poorgirl.

45:04.134 --> 45:05.226
Oh, chorally, who's trembling?

45:06.203 --> 45:07.795
Maybe she went to the theater

45:07.971 --> 45:08.369
That's right!

45:08.538 --> 45:09.971
She's probably waitingus there.

45:10.240 --> 45:11.036
I hope...

45:14.811 --> 45:15.402
Where have youbeing?

45:15.779 --> 45:16.677

47:51.735 --> 47:52.497

47:52.736 --> 47:53.464
I may never see him again.

50:27.357 --> 50:28.085

50:43.840 --> 50:44.636
Good evening, Myra.

50:46.142 --> 50:48.804
It's very condescending
for you to come here at all.

50:50.246 --> 50:51.304
She's very unhappy, Madam!

50:52.015 --> 50:53.744
Her fiancee was calledto the front.

50:53.983 --> 50:55.814

50:56.119 --> 50:57.450
She was to be merry inthe morning.

50:57.620 --> 50:58.814
No anysocial event.

50:59.356 --> 51:01.483
The whole world doesn't
begin and end with ballet.

51:02.258 --> 51:03.384
My world does.

51:04.227 --> 51:06.388
And while you are withme, so must yours.

51:08.031 --> 51:10.625
The prescription does
no longer apply to Myra.

51:10.800 --> 51:11.789
Oh, don't sacrifice her, Madam!

51:13.002 --> 51:13.730
I warned you.

51:14.871 --> 51:16.236

years, now I'm going to tell you...

51:25.014 --> 51:26.606

51:27.217 --> 51:28.514
I'm sick of you and your irritability.

51:29.285 --> 51:31.879
You treated usa lot of
slavesand chorally discipline.

51:32.422 --> 51:32.888
Here and that.

51:33.757 --> 51:35.088

51:52.393 --> 51:53.758
Well, no more ballet to me.

51:54.661 --> 51:56.185
I am sick of the highbrow and feet.

51:57.498 --> 51:58.055
You and I, ducky

52:06.874 --> 52:07.499
Yes?

52:08.175 --> 52:08.800

52:34.501 --> 52:36.332
Well, Myra, I am all
settled town, howabout you?

52:36.603 --> 52:37.501
No luck.

52:38.705 --> 52:39.194
There's nothing there.

52:39.773 --> 52:41.138
No reason for looking.

52:41.308 --> 52:43.435
Well, while I doing last
week, I didn't really expect...

52:45.245 --> 52:46.109
How about the dress shop?

52:46.814 --> 52:47.872
Fairly needed.

52:48.282 --> 52:48.714
Fetero?

52:49.183 --> 52:49.581
Filled.

52:50.818 --> 52:51.375
Naturally.

52:52.319 --> 52:53.217
They put me onthe waiting.

52:54.254 --> 52:55.221
It's confidence, isn'tit?

52:56.457 --> 52:59.187
Oh! Myra, we're a couple
of howling successes,

53:00.461 --> 53:01.985
sitting on thetop of world, aren't we?

53:02.496 --> 53:03.793
You'rein nicemood, aren't you?

53:04.398 --> 53:06.764
No wonder you're sitting here and
started feeling sorry for yourself.

53:07.301 --> 53:08.598
Lfl don't feel sorry for myself, who will?

53:09.169 --> 53:10.796
Probably you didn't eat and you're hungry.

53:11.104 --> 53:11.729
Come on, give me a hand.

53:12.239 --> 53:13.706
You'll feel better when
you have something to eat.

53:16.977 --> 53:17.966
Myra...

53:20.647 --> 53:22.376
You'reprobably sick of sitting here...

53:22.549 --> 53:24.517
Honestly, why don't you let Roy know...

53:26.086 --> 53:26.711
We're out of work?

53:27.187 --> 53:27.744
That we're broke!

53:28.522 --> 53:28.988
Flat broke!

53:29.456 --> 53:30.423
Down to our last tin!

53:32.292 --> 53:32.815
Only why?

53:33.427 --> 53:35.190
Better let him worry that we are starving.

53:35.762 --> 53:36.854
Kitty, we're not starving.

53:37.231 --> 53:37.959
Nobodyis starving.

53:38.999 --> 53:40.728
You mean people starveonly totell about it.

53:41.602 --> 53:43.297
I don't know what are we goingto do.

53:44.071 --> 53:46.733
Can't get job in the show,
can't get anywhere else.

53:47.875 --> 53:50.343
Madam was downhere, Igo to
her with pride orno pride.

53:51.612 --> 53:52.738
But itis justno body.

53:55.449 --> 53:58.179
Myra, I am frightened!

53:59.853 --> 54:00.911
I havenever been frightened before.

54:03.156 --> 54:03.884
I don't like it.

54:08.095 --> 54:08.618
Oh, Kitty...

54:09.997 --> 54:12.056
Perhaps it's selfish on
me notto let Roy know.

54:13.367 --> 54:14.857
Perhaps it's sort of stupid pride about it...

54:16.236 --> 54:17.294
Can't we wait just a little while?

54:17.704 --> 54:19.763
Just alittle while longer,
something must till happen.

54:20.841 --> 54:21.671
Lfit doesn't...

54:21.842 --> 54:22.467
Well...

54:23.410 --> 54:24.638
Oh, its bedge, for therent

54:24.845 --> 54:25.174
Pretending you're in rehearsal

54:25.345 --> 54:26.744
Oh, yes!

54:32.753 --> 54:33.685
Miss Lester?

54:34.555 --> 54:35.385
I am Miss Lester.

54:35.656 --> 54:36.486
For you, Miss Lester.

54:37.324 --> 54:37.915
Thank you.

54:38.458 --> 54:39.152
Quite all right, Miss.

54:40.561 --> 54:41.619
Kitty?

54:41.795 --> 54:42.784
Flower!

54:43.430 --> 54:44.124
I can't imagine!

54:44.598 --> 54:46.156
Put them down here.

54:51.004 --> 54:52.232
Oh, they're lovely!

54:52.406 --> 54:54.101
Who do you suppose...

54:54.575 --> 54:55.667
Kitty, it's Roy, it's handwriting.

54:57.978 --> 54:59.240
Fifteen, eighteen, twenty...

55:00.480 --> 55:03.415
Twenty... oh... it mustcost a pound atleast.

55:04.051 --> 55:05.985
Oh, enough to buy a lot
of food for whole week.

55:06.153 --> 55:09.350
While my man got leaves, you'll
be seeing these through him.

55:09.957 --> 55:11.083
And with them I send you warm...

55:12.726 --> 55:16.059
We could sell them to the florist to
the corner buy ourselves real meal.

55:17.230 --> 55:18.993
But I... don't think you favor the idea?

55:22.769 --> 55:23.258
No!

55:24.504 --> 55:24.970
Oh! Kitty!

55:25.739 --> 55:26.398
His mother's coming here.

55:27.307 --> 55:27.671
To London?

55:28.342 --> 55:29.274
Yes, yes, Listen...

55:29.576 --> 55:31.134
My mother's launching a
few days from a Red Cross,

55:31.445 --> 55:33.037
where is coming to town
and expect to see you.

55:33.880 --> 55:34.972
I know you areto get well with her.

55:35.148 --> 55:35.637
She's very nice.

55:36.416 --> 55:37.542
In fact, she'squite like me.

55:38.685 --> 55:40.619
Kitty, do I... I can't have herhere!

55:40.787 --> 55:41.879
Why not?

55:42.055 --> 55:43.989
Let's give hera little
party and rob a lot of tin.

55:44.191 --> 55:45.283
Let's get meeting at somewhere...

55:45.759 --> 55:46.384
For tea perhaps.

55:47.260 --> 55:48.818
Oh! Kitty, butimaginehis mother!

55:49.463 --> 55:51.727
I'm often not meeting with hereither.

55:52.766 --> 55:54.290
Why are you funny of dragging them?

55:55.602 --> 55:56.728
I wonder if she doesn't like me.

55:57.337 --> 55:57.996
Well, she'd better.

55:58.438 --> 55:59.871
Or won't we fire him at all!

56:01.441 --> 56:02.032
Myra, can't be!

56:02.442 --> 56:02.874
Oh, Kitty!

56:03.043 --> 56:05.238
Don't you see the meeting her
will be like seeing Roy again!

56:06.580 --> 56:08.047
Don't be such a darling to him!

56:08.782 --> 56:10.306
Now perhaps I can start to repay you.

56:11.118 --> 56:11.447
No.

56:12.519 --> 56:16.080
I'll see it from now on everything
gonna take turns to turn better.

56:17.224 --> 56:18.248
I am sure I do.

56:23.196 --> 56:23.719
One?

56:23.964 --> 56:25.261
No, that'll beenough one minute.

56:26.500 --> 56:27.865
Is there any table near by the window?

56:28.035 --> 56:28.660
I think so.

56:42.783 --> 56:44.478
No, thank you, I'll wait
her... for my friend.

56:44.918 --> 56:47.011
She islady Margate Cunning, I am Miss Lester.

56:47.621 --> 56:49.521
If shecome, would youdirect her to be here?

56:49.690 --> 56:50.315
Certainly.

57:15.015 --> 57:16.243
What time is it... please?

57:16.983 --> 57:18.450
It's ten minutes to five, Miss.

57:18.618 --> 57:19.084
Thank you.

57:19.386 --> 57:20.717
Your friend seems beenheld up.

57:21.121 --> 57:21.587
Yes.

57:22.355 --> 57:24.050
Surely you would like a cup of
tea while you're waiting, Miss.

57:24.391 --> 57:26.086
Oh, no, thank you, I am sure
she'll behere any minute.

57:26.860 --> 57:28.350
Perhaps you can take look
at these evening papers.

57:28.695 --> 57:29.286
Oh, thank you.

58:56.850 --> 58:57.578
Feeling better, Miss?

58:59.119 --> 59:00.211
Here, taking another sip.

59:04.758 --> 59:05.850
You fan, don't you?

59:08.528 --> 59:09.995
Well, you did give us a fright?

59:10.630 --> 59:12.495
Wouldn't you like to go the
rest room lie downa little bit?

59:12.666 --> 59:16.693
But I... I'd rather stay
here if you don't mind.

59:17.370 --> 59:18.894
Let's take another drop of this thing.

59:24.644 --> 59:25.269
Better?

59:26.179 --> 59:26.975
Sure?

59:28.048 --> 59:28.980
I'll be all right.

59:30.650 --> 59:31.446
Sit quiet and rest.

59:32.185 --> 59:33.743
If your frienddoesn'tcome,
I will call a taxi.

01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:07.948
Are you Miss Lester?

01:00:09.789 --> 01:00:10.255
Yes.

01:00:10.824 --> 01:00:13.349
I am Margaret Cunning, Roy's mother.

01:00:14.394 --> 01:00:15.224
I'm afraid I get you waiting.

01:00:15.395 --> 01:00:16.657
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

01:00:17.297 --> 01:00:18.457
My train was half an hour late.

01:00:18.632 --> 01:00:19.860
You know how this tidies day's?

01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:22.996
But I come straight From
Scholand to keep thisappointment.

01:00:23.336 --> 01:00:24.769
So I do hope you forgive me.

01:00:26.172 --> 01:00:26.763
What should wehave?

01:00:27.207 --> 01:00:27.673
Tea?

01:00:27.874 --> 01:00:28.670
Littlecakes?

01:00:30.010 --> 01:00:30.772
No... no, thank you.

01:00:31.011 --> 01:00:33.571
I don't think I can stay any long.

01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:39.518
Tea for one then, and some thin toasts.

01:00:41.087 --> 01:00:42.554
I do hope you're not going to run off once.

01:00:43.056 --> 01:00:44.717
I wanted so much to meet you.

01:00:45.225 --> 01:00:46.886
But I've been so terribly busy you know,

01:00:47.127 --> 01:00:49.891
I've been turning all country place
into a rested home for wounded men

01:00:50.430 --> 01:00:53.695
By the way, I telephone you
from Scotland to the hotel where

01:00:53.867 --> 01:00:54.856
Roy told me you are staying.

01:00:55.068 --> 01:00:56.035
But they said you got away.

01:00:56.403 --> 01:00:58.303
And then I tryto get in touch
with you through the Ballet.

01:00:58.872 --> 01:00:59.998
But they said you've got to America.

01:01:00.607 --> 01:01:02.871
After about a while ago when your newscame.

01:01:03.243 --> 01:01:04.733
I havemy mails disforwarded.

01:01:05.912 --> 01:01:06.378
There are reasons.

01:01:07.747 --> 01:01:09.374
Oh, mydear, Ididn't mean to pride.

01:01:12.519 --> 01:01:13.076
Forgive me, mydear...

01:01:13.253 --> 01:01:15.187
But you're notafraid of me, are you?

01:01:15.822 --> 01:01:19.223
I knowit is alittle bit of odd, dear,
meeting one's future children in law.

01:01:19.392 --> 01:01:20.586
I don't remember how Idrag it...

01:01:21.261 --> 01:01:22.728
But I am not that terrified, am I?.

01:01:24.097 --> 01:01:26.327
I know we're going to be good friends?

01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:29.734
I feelthat I know
youalreadythroughRoy's letter.

01:01:30.337 --> 01:01:31.634
And I want to write him and tell him

01:01:31.805 --> 01:01:34.467
you and I havemet and we
likeeach other verymuch.

01:01:35.408 --> 01:01:36.033
May I write him that?

01:01:36.476 --> 01:01:37.500
Yes, yes, of course!

01:01:41.181 --> 01:01:43.172
I suppose there're a lot
of things you want toknow

01:01:43.416 --> 01:01:44.508
about Roy thatl couldtell you...

01:01:44.684 --> 01:01:46.276
And I am sure that things
about him you could tell me.

01:01:46.619 --> 01:01:47.551
Why aren't they bring your tea?

01:01:47.721 --> 01:01:48.745
They are very slow.

01:01:48.989 --> 01:01:49.921
Shouldl call a waitress?

01:01:51.391 --> 01:01:52.824
Don't bother, I'm no hurry.

01:01:54.327 --> 01:01:56.158
Would you rather that I
didn'tspeak to you about Roy?

01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:58.822
No, no...

01:01:59.165 --> 01:02:00.223
Why should youthink that?

01:02:01.368 --> 01:02:02.164
What is that to say?

01:02:05.972 --> 01:02:07.769
Forgive me, mydear, but are you quite well?

01:02:08.675 --> 01:02:09.801
Yes, yes, of course.

01:02:09.976 --> 01:02:11.000
I... I had a drink...

01:02:11.177 --> 01:02:11.541
That'sall.

01:02:11.811 --> 01:02:13.301
That made me feel... funny.

01:02:14.114 --> 01:02:14.773
Weird!

01:02:16.816 --> 01:02:17.976
What did I cangot Scotland?

01:02:18.318 --> 01:02:19.080
I had never been there.

01:02:19.519 --> 01:02:20.918
Oh, itsounds of quange, you know that?

01:02:21.388 --> 01:02:22.912
Had that in peace?

01:02:24.591 --> 01:02:25.558
Pecansofisland?

01:02:25.959 --> 01:02:28.587
I've been there neither.

01:02:31.097 --> 01:02:32.394
Why are you stared at me like that?

01:02:34.634 --> 01:02:36.465
I am trying tosee youas Roy sees you.

01:02:38.104 --> 01:02:41.437
Myra, I want you to remember
that I try to be your friend.

01:02:42.409 --> 01:02:46.402
I havecome because Roy wantedme
to come, andbecausel wish to.

01:02:47.714 --> 01:02:49.011
Perhaps we'll try again someday.

01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:53.583
Perhaps on Roy's next leave
he'll bring you tothe country.

01:02:56.856 --> 01:02:57.379
Bye-bye!

01:03:05.865 --> 01:03:06.729
The lady is leaving, Miss.

01:04:06.993 --> 01:04:08.187
Myra!

01:04:13.199 --> 01:04:13.893
Myra!

01:04:24.811 --> 01:04:25.470
Who isit?

01:04:25.678 --> 01:04:27.202
Does Miss MyraLester gone out? Mrs. Clack?

01:04:27.947 --> 01:04:29.539
What? What isit?

01:04:29.749 --> 01:04:30.477
Where is Miss Lester?

01:04:30.683 --> 01:04:31.945
How should I know? She went out.

01:04:32.185 --> 01:04:32.617
When?

01:04:32.819 --> 01:04:33.615
About an hour ago.

01:04:34.154 --> 01:04:34.950
You should've never let her.

01:04:35.321 --> 01:04:37.949
You know she'snot well enoughto
go out. Not like this too.

01:04:38.391 --> 01:04:40.791
This is not nursing house, Miss
Melody, not your nursing home.

01:04:48.968 --> 01:04:49.798
Myra, where have you been?

01:04:50.270 --> 01:04:51.931
Whatever made you go out at night likethis!

01:04:53.406 --> 01:04:54.464
You will got the cold in rain too.

01:04:55.275 --> 01:04:56.742
Now you come on and stay in bed.

01:04:57.744 --> 01:04:59.109
I spend several monthstrying to build you up

01:04:59.345 --> 01:05:00.812
You'regoing to do silly thinglike this.

01:05:01.881 --> 01:05:03.314
I can't trust you out of my sight.

01:05:07.987 --> 01:05:08.954
Now you get those things off.

01:05:09.622 --> 01:05:10.611
Doublequick time too.

01:05:11.891 --> 01:05:13.051
I'll pick you up hot water bottle.

01:05:15.795 --> 01:05:16.318
Kitty...

01:05:16.863 --> 01:05:17.192
Yes...

01:05:18.565 --> 01:05:19.964
How did the show goes tonight?

01:05:20.133 --> 01:05:20.963
Oh, same as usual.

01:05:23.036 --> 01:05:23.764
Was itgood house?

01:05:24.837 --> 01:05:25.633
So so.

01:05:27.674 --> 01:05:28.333

01:05:30.076 --> 01:05:30.770
I wentto the theater.

01:05:32.412 --> 01:05:34.107

01:05:34.814 --> 01:05:35.610
Oh, yeah!

01:05:37.483 --> 01:05:38.973

What differences make as long as we live!

01:05:55.435 --> 01:05:56.402
Where's the money coming from?

01:06:00.106 --> 01:06:01.403
Where do you think I've been getting it?

01:06:09.048 --> 01:06:09.878

You did it forme.

01:06:22.495 --> 01:06:23.587
No, I didn't.

01:06:24.631 --> 01:06:25.393
I'd done it anyhow.

01:06:25.965 --> 01:06:26.829

01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:28.457

01:06:29.469 --> 01:06:31.027
No boys want to merry you.

01:06:45.318 --> 01:06:46.250
No, no, you wouldn't.

01:06:47.287 --> 01:06:48.584
You think you would, but you wouldn't.

01:06:49.956 --> 01:06:50.684
I thought of that.

01:06:53.092 --> 01:06:54.059
But it wasn't brave enough.

01:06:55.094 --> 01:06:56.061
I wanted to goon living.

01:06:56.329 --> 01:06:58.297

01:06:59.632 --> 01:07:00.428
We're young, and it's...

01:07:01.301 --> 01:07:02.325
It's good to live!

01:07:02.502 --> 01:07:03.833
Even the life that I'mliving now...

01:07:04.704 --> 01:07:06.262
God knows

01:07:08.908 --> 01:07:10.739

01:09:16.035 --> 01:09:16.660
How's luck?

01:09:17.502 --> 01:09:18.094
No such thing.

01:11:13.886 --> 01:11:14.614
It's you, isn't it.

01:11:15.621 --> 01:11:16.178
It's really you.

01:11:16.989 --> 01:11:17.546

Oh, darling! Let me look at you.

01:11:23.362 --> 01:11:24.158

01:11:25.031 --> 01:11:26.293

01:11:26.465 --> 01:11:26.829

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.558
Oh, Roy... you're alive.

01:11:32.204 --> 01:11:35.799
Oh, atthe once I've waited for this moment,

It's over, darling, it's all over.

01:11:49.088 --> 01:11:49.918

01:11:50.456 --> 01:11:52.617

01:12:06.439 --> 01:12:06.962
You miss me?

01:12:10.042 --> 01:12:10.770
Do youthink I was...

01:12:12.144 --> 01:12:13.475
Didn't you know I was indestructible?

01:12:14.246 --> 01:12:15.508
How can I die when we were engaged?

01:12:15.781 --> 01:12:16.713
Do youthink I will break our engagement?

01:12:17.450 --> 01:12:19.042
Ho... you don'tknow me, young woman.

01:12:19.285 --> 01:12:20.411
Well, I was wounded...

01:12:20.786 --> 01:12:22.014
Somehow lost my identification...

01:12:22.488 --> 01:12:23.955
It's get a long story, I'll tell you someday.

01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:27.184
But anyhow, I was in Germany prison
camp, pretty nervously signed off,

01:12:27.426 --> 01:12:28.688
but... I got out at last from Switzerland.

01:12:29.295 --> 01:12:30.091
Mothercame over of course.

01:12:30.262 --> 01:12:31.058
My intern knows mine.

01:12:32.264 --> 01:12:34.255
And I heard that... she lost touch with you.

01:12:34.967 --> 01:12:35.865
I was lost my mind.

01:12:36.502 --> 01:12:36.968
What happened...

01:12:37.136 --> 01:12:37.761
Did she find you?

01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:39.066
Did you get contact with her?

01:12:39.605 --> 01:12:39.934
No.

01:12:41.007 --> 01:12:43.475
Then, you didn't know I was coming.

01:12:43.643 --> 01:12:44.041
No.

01:12:46.145 --> 01:12:47.908
Well, you stood in thestation
while looking for a friend?

01:12:50.549 --> 01:12:52.414
Well, I am the friend you are looking for.

01:12:54.487 --> 01:12:55.044
Who was he?

01:12:55.321 --> 01:12:56.117
I insist upon knowing.

01:12:56.288 --> 01:12:57.255
Who was he?

01:12:57.757 --> 01:13:00.021
Oh, just a girl, no one in particular.

01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:02.184
Ho... just a little short of American...

01:13:02.361 --> 01:13:03.350

01:13:18.444 --> 01:13:19.035

01:13:19.645 --> 01:13:20.202
What does it pay?

01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:22.538

01:13:54.547 --> 01:13:55.571

Something I must speak...

01:15:18.230 --> 01:15:18.719
Will you?

01:15:19.532 --> 01:15:20.556
That'll be marvelous!

Roy, you mustn't!

01:15:28.507 --> 01:15:29.064
What is it?

01:15:30.643 --> 01:15:31.667
I can't go to the country with you.

01:15:31.977 --> 01:15:33.376
It's... quite out of the question.

01:15:34.647 --> 01:15:35.011
Why not?

01:15:35.614 --> 01:15:37.343
Pleasedon't ask me, but I... Isimply can't.

01:15:38.250 --> 01:15:39.683
Don't ask, God! You'vegot to tell me.

01:15:42.621 --> 01:15:43.246
All right.

01:15:44.223 --> 01:15:45.451
I lookterrible for one thing.

01:15:45.691 --> 01:15:46.715
I haven't haveany clothes.

01:15:46.892 --> 01:15:47.950
I... Ireally can't goanywhere.

01:15:48.127 --> 01:15:49.856
Ha... ha, you little fool.

01:15:50.162 --> 01:15:52.426
Let metell you one thing,
I think you're exaggerating.

01:15:54.767 --> 01:15:56.598
Now when I look at you, I perhaps
understand what are your say?

01:15:57.803 --> 01:15:59.794
Well, Madame Cunning to be,
we'll see what we can do?

01:15:59.972 --> 01:16:02.270
How would liketo be the
smartest woman in London?

01:16:02.541 --> 01:16:03.337
No, Roy, I can't.

01:16:16.121 --> 01:16:16.485
Well, darling...

01:16:19.525 --> 01:16:22.255
I am afraid I have been
stupid, conceived stupid.

01:16:23.729 --> 01:16:25.094
Cause you've never been
out of my thought, so I...

01:16:25.898 --> 01:16:27.991
I tookit for granted that
it was the same with you.

01:16:31.003 --> 01:16:32.197
There's someone else, isn't it, Myra?

01:16:33.672 --> 01:16:35.697
After all, youthoughtl'm... dead!

01:16:37.676 --> 01:16:38.643
There is someone else, isn't it?

01:16:39.411 --> 01:16:40.139
Don't be afraid to tell me.

01:16:41.046 --> 01:16:42.741
Roy, of coursethere isn't anyone else.

01:16:43.883 --> 01:16:44.645
There couldn'tbe.

01:16:45.951 --> 01:16:46.645
I love you

01:16:47.887 --> 01:16:48.911
I never love anyone else.

01:16:50.589 --> 01:16:51.283
I never shall.

01:16:52.925 --> 01:16:53.857
That'sthe truth, Roy.

01:16:57.496 --> 01:16:58.292
That'sall I want to know.

01:17:02.468 --> 01:17:04.436
Oh, darling, smile fora change.

01:17:05.704 --> 01:17:06.432
Have you forgotten how?

01:17:08.707 --> 01:17:10.038
That'sa good girl.

01:17:11.610 --> 01:17:13.237
I can't believe I'm with you again.

01:17:13.979 --> 01:17:14.445
But you are.

01:17:15.414 --> 01:17:16.073
Happy?

01:17:16.615 --> 01:17:17.274
Yes!

01:17:56.588 --> 01:17:58.112
Oh, Kitty, it's going to be so wonderful.

01:17:58.490 --> 01:17:58.888

01:18:25.250 --> 01:18:26.581
There are two sorts of people, Myra.

01:18:27.653 --> 01:18:29.450
Those who get breaks and those who don't!

01:18:30.255 --> 01:18:30.778
Well, I'm going to take a break.

01:18:30.956 --> 01:18:32.389
Now I am not going to think.

01:18:33.258 --> 01:18:34.748
You remember you once said
that you wanted to live?

01:18:36.061 --> 01:18:36.789
Well, I want to live.

He's so kind, Kitty, so
sweet, clean, and wonderful.

01:18:46.105 --> 01:18:47.197
I'll devote myself to him.

01:18:48.807 --> 01:18:50.399

01:19:21.106 --> 01:19:21.504

That one will be difficult.

01:20:19.865 --> 01:20:22.891
It must be wonderful to spend one's
childhood in a place like this.

01:20:23.368 --> 01:20:24.733

01:20:26.171 --> 01:20:27.069

01:22:31.296 --> 01:22:32.228
Oh! Roy, I forgot.

01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:35.029

01:22:35.634 --> 01:22:39.400

01:24:09.928 --> 01:24:12.488
of good familyin the county
who wouldjump off to Roy.

01:24:12.731 --> 01:24:14.096

Shall we wake up suddenly, find it untrue?

01:25:50.595 --> 01:25:51.823
Roy, don't be defeated.

01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:16.044
When?

01:27:16.581 --> 01:27:18.913
When I was waiting in a

01:28:27.652 --> 01:28:31.110
Oh, well... that dance
is a kind mythos-vigor

01:28:32.257 --> 01:28:34.953
I can retired now
permanently, write my memories.

01:28:35.393 --> 01:28:36.519

01:28:37.262 --> 01:28:38.422

01:28:40.465 --> 01:28:42.695
Do youthink Idon't know

01:28:43.068 --> 01:28:45.161
Made appoint of dancing
in front all of the people?

01:28:45.637 --> 01:28:46.763
Point, point, what point?

01:28:47.572 --> 01:28:49.369
You wanted to show them
you that approve of me.

01:28:49.841 --> 01:28:51.365
Cause you knewif you approved, they would.

01:28:51.843 --> 01:28:53.504
Incidentally, I Charlie will like it.

01:28:54.446 --> 01:28:56.004
Oh, Duke... I...

01:28:56.948 --> 01:28:58.540

01:28:58.984 --> 01:29:00.474
I wantto be success because ofRoy...

01:29:01.586 --> 01:29:02.985
Oh, you know what these peopleare.

01:29:04.055 --> 01:29:06.455
They're good people, major, kind people.

01:29:07.225 --> 01:29:10.388
But they're old-fashioned,
rather limited of social ideas.

01:29:11.229 --> 01:29:14.392
What good enough for our fridge to
grade good enough meat sortof things.

01:29:16.935 --> 01:29:17.765
You see that emblem?

01:29:18.503 --> 01:29:18.969
Mm...

01:29:19.704 --> 01:29:20.398
Brokenlodge.

01:29:21.206 --> 01:29:22.230
Our arrangement battleridge.

01:29:22.774 --> 01:29:23.604
Roy wears one too.

01:29:24.209 --> 01:29:26.268
Lately, the only way we
keep up to thetradition

01:29:26.511 --> 01:29:28.911
is to lead thedull life
from many oneof themselves.

01:29:29.781 --> 01:29:32.648
Do youthink of dancers,
someone who little of races...,

01:29:33.118 --> 01:29:35.279
Shouldl say, put it in mind... Mm... ha...

01:29:36.321 --> 01:29:38.915
Too bad you can't liveup to
that idea, Myra, isn't it?

01:29:39.791 --> 01:29:40.758
You may go to fun, wouldn't it?

01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:42.819
Yes, I would.

01:29:44.562 --> 01:29:46.427
But Roy's instinct tells him what you are.

01:29:47.966 --> 01:29:49.433
My instinct tells me too.

01:29:50.835 --> 01:29:52.462
You'resound, and good.

01:29:53.772 --> 01:29:55.797
That bad is never going
to suffered your head.

01:29:57.475 --> 01:30:01.707
Lfl will haveshown that, I
wouldn't welcome you as Ido now.

01:30:08.053 --> 01:30:08.951
The longer will be fool, honey.

01:30:09.521 --> 01:30:10.044
Here'sher, Roy.

01:30:10.321 --> 01:30:12.789
You'd better take her away before
she discovers the facts in the mask.

01:30:20.498 --> 01:30:20.793
ListenMyra...

01:30:22.167 --> 01:30:23.464

Excuseus, sir.

01:30:28.173 --> 01:30:28.639
Thank you.

01:30:29.274 --> 01:30:30.070
For what? For what?

01:30:30.308 --> 01:30:31.172
Go andenjoy yourself.

01:30:42.887 --> 01:30:44.912

Coming.

01:31:55.927 --> 01:31:56.621
Do I disturb you?

01:31:57.395 --> 01:31:58.589
Oh, no.

01:31:59.430 --> 01:32:00.556
Pleasecome in, lady Margaret.

01:32:01.399 --> 01:32:04.095
I'm not very gently... so in case
you're asleep, I shouldn't wake.

01:32:05.670 --> 01:32:06.466
Won't you sit down!

01:32:06.704 --> 01:32:07.568
I thought you be awake.

01:32:07.939 --> 01:32:10.407
I say she's far too
happier excited tobe asleep.

01:32:11.009 --> 01:32:12.237
Two things keep one up.

01:32:12.744 --> 01:32:14.006
Very happinessand very miserly.

01:32:14.612 --> 01:32:15.135
Don't you think so?

01:32:15.613 --> 01:32:16.341
Yes.

01:32:17.048 --> 01:32:19.539
I couldn't go to sleepeither without
getting something off mychest,

01:32:19.717 --> 01:32:21.309
So to speak you American said.

01:32:21.619 --> 01:32:22.586
Are you sure you are not too tired?

01:32:23.154 --> 01:32:24.052
No, no, of course not.

01:32:24.856 --> 01:32:26.323
It's about ourlast meeting inLondon.

01:32:26.624 --> 01:32:28.353
That is preyedin my mind eversince.

01:32:29.494 --> 01:32:31.587
Do youbear graduates me for that, Myra?

01:32:32.730 --> 01:32:33.594
Oh, no, lady Margaret.

01:32:34.232 --> 01:32:35.722
I came with prejudice.

01:32:36.901 --> 01:32:37.526
When Isaw you, you seemed strange to me.

01:32:40.271 --> 01:32:41.363
I thought you couldn'tbe...

01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:45.337
Well... what I wanted Roy's wife to be.

01:32:46.678 --> 01:32:49.044
I haveno excuse except mother's excuse for

01:32:49.314 --> 01:32:51.248
wanting any possible idea for her son.

01:32:52.517 --> 01:32:53.074
Can you forgive me?

01:32:54.185 --> 01:32:55.049
But I have nothing to forgive.

01:32:55.854 --> 01:32:56.843
When Igot home the next day,

01:32:57.121 --> 01:32:59.282
I found the telegram telling
the drafting newsabout Roy.

01:33:00.491 --> 01:33:01.651
And when couldthink again...

01:33:02.060 --> 01:33:04.494
It suddenly struck me that
youhad known all the time,

01:33:04.963 --> 01:33:06.624
that you've just seen his namein paper.

01:33:07.332 --> 01:33:08.890
And you hardlyknew what you're saying.

01:33:10.301 --> 01:33:10.926
Is that truth?

01:33:11.536 --> 01:33:11.934
Yes.

01:33:14.105 --> 01:33:16.767
Oh, you poor child ifl only know.

01:33:23.014 --> 01:33:25.881
I did my very best to find
you, but you disappeared.

01:33:27.352 --> 01:33:29.912
And now I wantto makeit
up to you inthe future.

01:33:34.425 --> 01:33:36.859
I am very happy about this marriage, Myra.

01:33:37.729 --> 01:33:39.993
And I know we are going
to be wonderful friends.

01:33:41.966 --> 01:33:43.228
Forgive me forbeing sentimental.

01:33:46.004 --> 01:33:47.062
Good night, mydaughter.

01:34:08.493 --> 01:34:09.289
Lady Margaret!

01:34:13.998 --> 01:34:14.726
Lady Margaret!

01:34:20.471 --> 01:34:20.960
Lady Margaret!

01:34:21.306 --> 01:34:21.863
Yes, Myra!

01:34:23.107 --> 01:34:23.801
I mustspeak you.

01:34:25.043 --> 01:34:25.873
Why, of course, Myra.

01:34:28.746 --> 01:34:29.804
I can't merry Roy.

01:34:41.859 --> 01:34:43.986
Sit down quietly, dear, tell me.

01:34:44.963 --> 01:34:45.486
I must go away.

01:34:46.064 --> 01:34:47.292
I should nevercome here.

01:34:48.266 --> 01:34:49.164
I knewit is impossible.

01:34:49.867 --> 01:34:51.494
...But, I keptconceiving myself.

01:34:53.571 --> 01:34:54.469
I got to go away... I...

01:34:56.140 --> 01:34:57.038
I mustn't see him again.

01:34:58.977 --> 01:35:00.774
My dear, why don't youtell me what itis?

01:35:01.279 --> 01:35:02.143
I'm sure I canhelp you.

01:35:02.647 --> 01:35:03.739
No, noone canhelp me.

01:35:05.316 --> 01:35:08.046
But mydear, what can it
be that is soterrible?

01:35:09.687 --> 01:35:10.745
Has there beensomeoneelse?

01:35:15.460 --> 01:35:18.918
Oh! Lady Margaret... you are nice.

01:35:21.065 --> 01:35:21.759
Myra?!

01:35:21.966 --> 01:35:22.398
Yes!

01:35:23.134 --> 01:35:23.725
Yes! Yes!

01:35:23.901 --> 01:35:24.765
Myra!?

01:35:25.036 --> 01:35:25.900
Yes, that's all true.

01:35:26.337 --> 01:35:28.771
It's on your mind, but you're
telling yourself it can't be true.

01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:30.006
It's true!

01:35:30.708 --> 01:35:31.037
Myra!

01:35:31.676 --> 01:35:31.971
Yes!

01:35:33.444 --> 01:35:34.672
Why didn't youtell him?

01:35:37.248 --> 01:35:38.306
I didn't have the courage.

01:35:39.117 --> 01:35:40.482
Or I can give plenty of reasons.

01:35:41.386 --> 01:35:42.478
I was hungry, I was poor

01:35:42.653 --> 01:35:43.312
I... IthoughtRoy wasdead... but...

01:35:45.857 --> 01:35:48.018
I could make you understand...
but it would tell...

01:35:50.828 --> 01:35:52.352
I don't know what to say?

01:35:55.666 --> 01:35:57.566
But it's my fault as much as yours...

01:35:57.735 --> 01:36:00.602
for not havingunderstood,
fornot having taken care of...

01:36:00.772 --> 01:36:02.103
Oh! Don't be nice to me!

01:36:04.475 --> 01:36:05.169
Lfl...

01:36:05.777 --> 01:36:07.438
Ifl leave early in the morning...

01:36:08.179 --> 01:36:10.670
Ifl never seen Roy again...

01:36:11.883 --> 01:36:13.282
Would you promise me he'll never know?

01:36:15.420 --> 01:36:17.354
I couldn't bear hurt him like that.

01:36:18.956 --> 01:36:19.513
Myra!

01:36:22.026 --> 01:36:23.926
Oh! Let us wait until morning.

01:36:24.962 --> 01:36:26.122
Let's think this over.

01:36:26.464 --> 01:36:26.953
Would you promise?

01:36:31.169 --> 01:36:31.931
I promise.

01:36:33.337 --> 01:36:33.826
Thank you.

01:36:36.207 --> 01:36:37.037
You'vebeen sogood.

01:36:38.743 --> 01:36:41.678
I wishl could've beenall youhope... but

01:37:01.799 --> 01:37:02.527
Myra!

01:37:05.503 --> 01:37:06.663
What're your little game about?

01:37:07.371 --> 01:37:08.861
Why are you doing crawling
around at this hour?

01:37:09.407 --> 01:37:10.271
You'vebeen with mother?

01:37:10.441 --> 01:37:11.066
Yes.

01:37:11.509 --> 01:37:12.237
Isn't she wonderful?

01:37:12.977 --> 01:37:13.568
Yes, she is.

01:37:14.412 --> 01:37:16.437
Honey, I wouldn't sleep so
I've been walking in the garden,

01:37:17.014 --> 01:37:18.481
confronting mygood luck to the stars.

01:37:18.649 --> 01:37:19.013
Were they pleased?

01:37:19.183 --> 01:37:20.241
Mm... they seemto different.

01:37:20.751 --> 01:37:22.378
They wouldn't do glaring,
they're little exhibitions.

01:37:23.654 --> 01:37:24.313
Oh!

01:37:26.491 --> 01:37:27.685
Have you ever seen this before?

01:37:28.659 --> 01:37:29.057
I think so

01:37:29.427 --> 01:37:30.257
Here.

01:37:32.997 --> 01:37:34.464
But I gave it to you, it's yours.

01:37:35.366 --> 01:37:37.994
I think it'll be saver
with you, just as are we.

01:37:38.970 --> 01:37:41.404
I dropit in the garden momentago, I
was finding it until I found it again.

01:37:42.607 --> 01:37:44.438
I think you'd better have
it from now on, because...

01:37:44.942 --> 01:37:47.137
now weare both, as they said, one...

01:37:48.012 --> 01:37:49.639
Reallydoesn'tmatter which
one keeps it, doesn't it?

01:37:50.715 --> 01:37:51.272
It brought me luck.

01:37:52.316 --> 01:37:53.214
Now it will bring you luck

01:37:53.751 --> 01:37:54.775
I'll keep it for you, Roy.

01:37:56.521 --> 01:37:57.180
I'm tired, darling.

01:37:58.022 --> 01:37:58.750
Yes, you look tired.

01:37:58.923 --> 01:38:00.254
Penestratenousday for you, darling.

01:38:01.692 --> 01:38:02.215
Good night, darling

01:38:03.794 --> 01:38:04.761
Good bye, darling.

01:38:06.164 --> 01:38:07.927
Why good-bye, it's only for a morning...

01:38:08.633 --> 01:38:13.229
Because every parting from you,
is... is like a littleeternality.

01:38:16.374 --> 01:38:17.136
That'sthe wayl feel too.

01:38:19.143 --> 01:38:19.734
Good bye!

01:38:20.545 --> 01:38:22.069
Good bye! Little sentimentalist!

01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:32.245
Tomorrow, all day for ourselves!

01:38:33.724 --> 01:38:34.452
Yes, my love.

01:39:43.394 --> 01:39:44.383
Wait for me!

01:39:52.603 --> 01:39:53.501
Myra!

01:39:54.305 --> 01:39:54.794
Myra! It's Roy!

01:39:57.541 --> 01:39:58.064
Myra!

01:39:58.609 --> 01:40:00.600
What'sgoing on... oh, it's you.

01:40:01.078 --> 01:40:01.476
Hello, Kitty!

01:40:01.879 --> 01:40:02.538
Where's Myra?

01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:03.805
She's not with you?

01:40:04.348 --> 01:40:05.144
What're you talking about?

01:40:05.516 --> 01:40:06.505
She left Shaft's Garden last night.

01:40:07.151 --> 01:40:07.776
Without telling you?

01:40:08.753 --> 01:40:09.685
She's not beenhere then.

01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:11.478
Without your sincere hospitality
with you the other day.

01:40:12.089 --> 01:40:12.851
Look, can I come in?

01:40:13.257 --> 01:40:13.621
Of course!

01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:17.057
I was just about to eat.

01:40:18.162 --> 01:40:18.958
Sit down.

01:40:19.964 --> 01:40:20.623
What happened?

01:40:21.365 --> 01:40:22.491
She left a note she couldn't merry me.

01:40:23.768 --> 01:40:24.666
Why, is there any trouble?

01:40:25.269 --> 01:40:25.735
With... with your family?

01:40:25.903 --> 01:40:26.665
No...

01:40:27.672 --> 01:40:30.072
It's incredible, Kitty, I
can't understand it at all.

01:40:30.608 --> 01:40:32.439
When last night we were together,

01:40:33.978 --> 01:40:35.309
At the first train, took a ticket for London.

01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:36.647
She must arrive hours ago.

01:40:36.947 --> 01:40:37.743
Oh, she's not been here.

01:40:38.616 --> 01:40:39.105

01:40:42.253 --> 01:40:42.912

01:40:44.155 --> 01:40:44.985

01:41:01.672 --> 01:41:03.196
