What does it mean?

01:48.101 --> 01:49.802
According to Oxford University,

01:49.803 --> 01:53.689
it means that my 20 years'
loyal service there

next to a little slipup

07:57.586 --> 07:58.720
Let the lady finish
her sentence.

07:58.721 --> 08:01.473
Thank you, Jeff!

08:01.474 --> 08:02.691
War. Yeah.

08:15.488 --> 08:17.722
We'd like to sign out
study room "F".

08:17.723 --> 08:18.857
It would appear
that in this battle,

08:18.858 --> 08:20.826
our bulge was
a little bit bigger.

08:20.827 --> 08:22.160
<i>[Chuckles]
Guten bye-bye.</i>

08:22.161 --> 08:23.495
Excuse me. Don't touch.

08:23.496 --> 08:26.815
Damn them and their
perfectly crafted timepieces.

08:26.816 --> 08:28.132
What else do you have
available?

08:28.133 --> 08:31.203
[Sighs]

08:31.204 --> 08:34.289
[Light buzzing]

08:34.289 --> 08:36.390
It's like
a Darren Aronofsky film.

08:36.392 --> 08:37.859
I'll get this.

08:37.860 --> 08:39.778
My fifth father-in-law
was an electrician.

08:39.779 --> 08:41.513
You pick up a thing or two.

08:41.514 --> 08:43.582
All: [Screaming]

08:43.582 --> 08:46.234
Agh! Everybody grab me,
please! Ugh!

08:46.235 --> 08:47.986
- Nobody grab him.
- [Screaming]

08:47.987 --> 08:49.921
Pierce, just let go.

08:49.922 --> 08:51.456
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

08:51.457 --> 08:52.707
Of the thing, Pierce.

08:52.708 --> 08:54.342
Oh, it smells like barbecue.

08:54.343 --> 08:56.228
We're getting up
earlier tomorrow.

08:56.229 --> 08:59.181
[Dramatic music]

09:03.970 --> 09:08.723
[Evil laughter]

09:08.724 --> 09:12.427
[Air hissing]

09:12.428 --> 09:13.628
Oh, no.

09:13.629 --> 09:15.514
- Oh!
- Ugh!

09:15.515 --> 09:18.483
[Somber music]

09:23.656 --> 09:27.359
[Maniacal laughter]

09:27.360 --> 09:28.593
Oh, look at them!

09:28.594 --> 09:30.946
[Sobbing]

09:30.947 --> 09:33.915
[Sad music]

09:36.669 --> 09:38.636
[Crash!]

09:52.184 --> 09:54.452
Hi.

09:54.453 --> 09:56.338
Thanks again for taking me in.

09:56.339 --> 09:59.591
We must have been great pals
before my Changnesia, huh?

09:59.592 --> 10:01.243
Oh, my...
That's it.

10:01.244 --> 10:03.044
You may have fooled
that handsome doctor,

10:03.045 --> 10:04.496
but you can't fool me.

10:04.497 --> 10:05.863
Oh, how convenient.

10:05.864 --> 10:07.632
Showing up here with Changnesia

10:07.633 --> 10:09.100
after you staged a coup,

10:09.101 --> 10:10.969
almost blew up the school,

10:10.970 --> 10:13.955
and locked me in a basement
for months!

10:13.956 --> 10:16.291
Without so much as a drop
of moisturizer!

10:16.292 --> 10:17.642
I did all that?

10:17.643 --> 10:18.876
I mean, Chang did all that?

10:18.877 --> 10:20.645
If that's true,

10:20.646 --> 10:23.999
then Chang, who is me,

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
deserves to go to jail.

10:25.001 --> 10:25.967
Well, he did.

10:25.968 --> 10:27.419
And you do.

10:27.420 --> 10:29.420
This is the worst thing
that's happened to me

10:29.421 --> 10:31.740
in my 96 hours of memory.

10:31.741 --> 10:32.908
[Door opens]

10:32.909 --> 10:36.194
And that failed
ventriloquist's name

10:36.195 --> 10:38.330
was Slobodan Milosevic.

10:38.331 --> 10:39.497
All: Ohh.

10:39.498 --> 10:42.517
For the essay portion
of your test on Monday,

10:42.518 --> 10:45.570
you will be asked to describe
a historical battle

10:45.571 --> 10:49.307
from the perspectives of both
the winners and the losers.

10:49.308 --> 10:50.375
No dioramas.

10:50.376 --> 10:53.278
All: [Groan]

10:53.279 --> 10:54.696
<i>Guten luck on the examination.</i>

10:54.697 --> 10:57.482
Ve vill be preparing for it
in study room "F",

10:57.483 --> 10:58.616
as in "Fictory".

10:58.617 --> 11:00.352
I like the way your old chair

11:00.353 --> 11:01.886
<i>cradles mein knaidels.</i>

11:01.887 --> 11:03.054
[Laughter]

11:03.055 --> 11:04.389
I just made that up.

11:04.390 --> 11:05.707
You know, English
is my second language.

11:05.708 --> 11:08.093
Jeff, stop.

11:08.094 --> 11:09.994
- It's over.
- No.

11:09.995 --> 11:11.913
These guys are horrible.

11:11.914 --> 11:13.315
Totally. Except Karl.

11:13.316 --> 11:14.532
- Really, Abed?
- Mm-hmm.

11:14.533 --> 11:15.600
Karl's not horrible?

11:15.601 --> 11:17.552
Even though he took your home?

11:17.553 --> 11:19.570
When I was growing up,
it was just me and my mom.

11:19.571 --> 11:20.538
I didn't have much of a family.

11:20.539 --> 11:23.258
That is, until I met you guys.

11:23.259 --> 11:25.610
So excuse me
if I'm not willing to give up

11:25.611 --> 11:29.047
the place where we became
a family.

11:29.048 --> 11:30.749
So what are we gonna do?

11:30.750 --> 11:32.851
We literally can't get up
any earlier.

11:32.852 --> 11:34.569
Many years ago,

11:34.570 --> 11:37.689
before the concept
of "too soon" existed,

11:37.690 --> 11:39.941
there was a show
about a bunch of goofy Nazis

11:39.942 --> 11:41.710
running a prison camp,

11:41.711 --> 11:44.462
<i>- and that show was called...
- Hogan's Heroes?</i>

11:44.463 --> 11:46.898
<i>- Hogan's Heroes.
- Yes.</i>

11:46.899 --> 11:49.567
And while, for a latchkey kid
with no jewish friends,

11:49.568 --> 11:51.970
it was a bit desensitizing,

11:51.971 --> 11:53.588
it still taught me

11:53.589 --> 11:57.325
that the lovable misfits
always win.

11:57.326 --> 11:59.444
And the bumbling Germans
always lose.

11:59.445 --> 12:01.629
All we need is a clever ruse.

12:01.630 --> 12:03.548
Strike that.
All we need is a ruse.

12:03.549 --> 12:05.000
You had me at "ruse."

12:05.001 --> 12:06.618
That was the last thing I said.

12:06.619 --> 12:09.020
Good thing you said it.

12:09.021 --> 12:10.989
[Indistinct chatter]

12:10.990 --> 12:13.992
[Lively German music]

12:17.996 --> 12:19.297
Ah!

12:19.298 --> 12:22.233
Welcome to Oktoberfest.

12:22.234 --> 12:24.569
- Vat is this?
- Call it a peace offering.

12:24.570 --> 12:26.187
You won.
We lost.

12:26.188 --> 12:28.790
Let's end this dumb war
and move on.

12:28.791 --> 12:30.274
Care for some
authentic blutwurst?

12:30.275 --> 12:31.342
This stuff's the real deal.

12:31.343 --> 12:32.927
We got it
down in little Munich.

12:32.928 --> 12:35.046
[Whispers]
It's been banned by the FDA.

12:35.047 --> 12:36.380
- Ooh!
- No, Karl!

12:36.381 --> 12:38.216
That blutwurst was
probably injected

12:38.217 --> 12:39.984
with a laxative to make us pull
a grete waitz

12:39.985 --> 12:41.086
in our trousers.

12:41.087 --> 12:42.620
I promise you,

12:42.621 --> 12:44.372
there's nothing gross
in this sausage.

12:44.373 --> 12:47.325
It's just pig's blood stuffed
into a cow's intestine.

12:47.326 --> 12:50.128
<i>Gott, that must be
nearly 100 luftballons!</i>

12:50.129 --> 12:51.179
[Laughing]

12:51.180 --> 12:53.214
Idiot! Do not accept
their gifts.

12:53.215 --> 12:55.366
Something is clearly up.

12:55.367 --> 12:57.602
Please, these are just
small tokens of our friendship.

12:57.603 --> 12:58.703
Oh, come on.

12:58.704 --> 13:01.205
<i>Dirndls, blutwurst,
luftballons.</i>

13:01.206 --> 13:03.541
A cartoonishly large cake.

13:03.542 --> 13:05.176
This is a ruse.

13:05.177 --> 13:07.779
<i>It is exactly like an episode
of Hogan's Villains.</i>

13:07.780 --> 13:09.948
Ruse?
This is no ruse.

13:09.949 --> 13:12.400
Just take that large cake
back to the study room

13:12.401 --> 13:13.752
and enjoy it there.

13:13.753 --> 13:15.470
So there's nothing hiding

13:15.471 --> 13:17.806
inside this giant
German chocolate cake?

13:17.807 --> 13:19.057
Ask Abed.

13:19.058 --> 13:23.061
You can trust him.
He's a friend.

13:23.062 --> 13:24.896
Nope. Just solid cake.

13:24.897 --> 13:26.948
Hmm.

13:26.949 --> 13:29.300
Then you wouldn't mind if I...

13:29.301 --> 13:30.635
Cut the cake?

13:30.636 --> 13:32.003
Or you could save it for later.

13:32.004 --> 13:33.304
You don't have to share it.

13:33.305 --> 13:35.640
Shirley stayed up all night
baking that for you.

13:35.641 --> 13:37.141
No problem.
I just used the eggs

13:37.142 --> 13:38.810
I would've used
for my son's breakfast.

13:38.811 --> 13:40.829
But it would be so easy for me

13:40.830 --> 13:43.147
to carve into this cake...

13:43.148 --> 13:44.215
And serve us all!

13:44.216 --> 13:45.350
Wait!

13:45.351 --> 13:47.102
Damn it. Sorry.

13:47.103 --> 13:49.020
We thought you were
stupider than this.

13:49.021 --> 13:52.023
Troy.

13:54.110 --> 13:56.161
Should I release the tear gas,
or has that ship sank?

13:56.162 --> 13:58.696
[Chuckles]

13:58.697 --> 14:01.015
An excellent attempt, Vinger,

14:01.016 --> 14:02.834
but we are smarter than you,
and once again,

14:02.835 --> 14:04.769
it shall be us who are savoring

14:04.770 --> 14:07.689
the smooth and somewhat
ha-ha-hoppy taste of victory.

14:07.690 --> 14:09.440
<i>Beer me, bitte.</i>

14:09.441 --> 14:11.526
Here you go.

14:11.527 --> 14:13.194
<i>As they say in Ferris Bueller,</i>

14:13.195 --> 14:14.712
<i>danke schoen.</i>

14:14.713 --> 14:16.581
And as they say in the movie,
gotcha!

14:16.582 --> 14:20.251
Gotcha.

14:20.252 --> 14:22.137
- Busted.
- Busted?

14:22.138 --> 14:23.188
For what?

14:23.189 --> 14:25.106
But there were dozens
of students

14:25.107 --> 14:26.391
at that Oktoberfest.

14:26.392 --> 14:28.443
But you were the only
German students

14:28.444 --> 14:29.944
celebrating German culture,

14:29.945 --> 14:32.530
and here at Greendale,
that is a big, fat no-no.

14:32.531 --> 14:36.167
We frown on anyone celebrating
their own cultural heritage.

14:36.168 --> 14:38.753
I mean, if the hasidic
student union wants

14:38.754 --> 14:41.523
to host a Kwanzaa celebration,
you go, Jews!

14:41.524 --> 14:43.641
Hanukkah? No, sir.

14:43.642 --> 14:45.009
It's why I keep a detailed list

14:45.010 --> 14:47.011
of every student's race
and nationality...

14:47.012 --> 14:49.581
to prevent racism
and nationalism.

14:49.582 --> 14:51.699
- This is an outrage!
- Relax.

14:51.700 --> 14:53.034
It's not like you're expelled.

14:53.035 --> 14:54.886
You're just banned from certain
campus amenities,

14:54.887 --> 14:57.755
uh, water fountains,
swimming pools... huh.

14:57.756 --> 14:59.156
Most of these
are water-based.

14:59.157 --> 15:01.042
Oh, and the study rooms.

15:01.043 --> 15:02.544
- Oh!
- Uh!

15:02.545 --> 15:03.711
[Phone rings]
Oh, I gotta take this.

15:03.712 --> 15:06.464
Bye-bye.

15:23.899 --> 15:25.450
Oh, cool.

15:25.451 --> 15:27.018
- What are we protesting?
- You guys.

15:27.019 --> 15:29.687
You've been hogging that
study room for three years.

15:29.688 --> 15:31.239
Somebody finally stood up
to you,

15:31.240 --> 15:32.657
and you had them banned.

15:32.658 --> 15:35.526
Why must our people
always be the victims?

15:35.527 --> 15:37.579
- What do we want?
- Justice!

15:37.580 --> 15:38.913
- When do we want it?
- Now!

15:38.914 --> 15:40.748
- What do we want?
- Justice!

15:40.749 --> 15:41.950
- Oh, my God.
- When do we want it?

15:41.951 --> 15:43.218
- Now!
- This whole time,

15:43.219 --> 15:45.486
we thought the Germans
were the Germans.

15:45.487 --> 15:48.640
But it turns out,
we're the Germans.

15:52.241 --> 15:55.367
Hang on. You guys are all siding
with the Germans?

15:55.368 --> 15:56.652
You realize these guys
are, like,

15:56.653 --> 15:58.120
contractor-grade tools.

15:58.121 --> 16:00.422
They signed out that room
fair and square,

16:00.423 --> 16:02.374
and then you had to take it
too far,

16:02.375 --> 16:04.810
like you always do
with that room.

16:04.811 --> 16:06.579
Yeah!

16:06.580 --> 16:09.215
[Suspenseful music]

16:09.216 --> 16:11.317
[Sighs]
Damn it!

16:11.318 --> 16:13.519
I signed this room out!

16:13.520 --> 16:15.237
And I have a final tomorrow!

16:15.238 --> 16:18.457
They lost a pen.

16:18.458 --> 16:19.791
Can you come back
in a few hours?

16:19.792 --> 16:21.977
We're playing
Dungeons & Dragons.

16:21.978 --> 16:23.529
Yes?
I left my notebook in there.

16:23.530 --> 16:24.663
Well, you're going to have
to come back later.

16:24.664 --> 16:26.632

Don't call me a Nazi.

We are going to nurse you
back to health.

16:56.897 --> 16:58.864
But why?

16:58.865 --> 17:01.600
Why take me back in
after everything I did to you?

17:01.601 --> 17:03.052
When I heard that you
had checked yourself into jail,

17:03.053 --> 17:04.603
I realized
you couldn't be faking.

17:04.604 --> 17:06.989
The real Chang
would never have remorse

17:06.990 --> 17:07.957
for what he did.

17:07.958 --> 17:09.758
I believe you...

17:09.759 --> 17:12.511
Kevin.

17:12.512 --> 17:13.845
Plus, curing Changnesia,

17:13.846 --> 17:14.813
that's a human interest story.

17:14.814 --> 17:15.998
That puts Greendale on the map.

17:15.999 --> 17:17.916
But your health comes second,
whoop, first,

17:17.917 --> 17:19.550
to the school.

17:19.551 --> 17:21.520
Oh, let's not hug.
Do you mind getting my...

17:21.521 --> 17:22.605
Okay.

17:22.606 --> 17:24.924
Probably shouldn't step on it.

17:24.925 --> 17:27.593
I feel guilty eating this cake.

17:27.594 --> 17:28.927
And not for the usual reasons.

17:28.928 --> 17:30.913
Hate to say it,
but this is what happens

17:30.914 --> 17:32.898
when a group of people
blindly follows

17:32.899 --> 17:34.533
a charismatic,
golden-throated leader.

17:34.534 --> 17:36.468
Are you actually comparing me
to Hitler?

17:36.469 --> 17:38.153
[Overlapping agreements]
There are similarities.

17:38.154 --> 17:40.072
Hang on.
Nobody's even willing

17:40.073 --> 17:42.491
to consider that I might be
the Hitler of this group?

17:42.492 --> 17:44.593
We were the good guys.

17:44.594 --> 17:46.378
How could everybody think
we're the bad guys?

17:46.379 --> 17:47.663
We are.

17:47.664 --> 17:49.365
When Karl and I were raiding
the Diamond North Caves,

17:49.366 --> 17:50.616
I was facing 50 Death Beatles.

17:50.617 --> 17:51.884
I would've perished for sure,
but he saved me.

17:51.885 --> 17:53.302
Then when I had a chance
to return the favor,

17:53.303 --> 17:54.920
I looked him in the eye, and I
told him it was solid cake.

17:54.921 --> 17:56.205
You were just following orders.

17:56.206 --> 17:57.990
There's probably a way I can
make it up to him.

17:57.991 --> 17:59.825
Oh.

17:59.826 --> 18:01.327
Maybe I'll give him
my four-pronged trident.

18:01.328 --> 18:03.262
Why don't you call it
a "quadrident"?

18:03.263 --> 18:04.897
- Shh.
- Ah!

18:04.898 --> 18:06.532
There you people are.

18:06.533 --> 18:10.336
I believe we have something
to discuss.

18:10.337 --> 18:12.037
Oh, my God.

18:12.038 --> 18:14.306
You clever British bastard.

18:14.307 --> 18:16.275
You set this whole thing up
to teach us a lesson.

18:16.276 --> 18:18.143
- What?
- Making the school pretend

18:18.144 --> 18:20.913
to hate us,
to show us that one man's hero

18:20.914 --> 18:22.364
is another man's villain.

18:22.365 --> 18:24.350
Of course!
We aren't Nazis.

18:24.351 --> 18:25.417
[Laughter]

18:25.418 --> 18:27.102
I tip my cap to you, sir.

18:27.103 --> 18:28.187
Lesson learned.

18:28.188 --> 18:29.772
Are you actually suggesting

18:29.773 --> 18:31.356
that a Professor at Greendale

18:31.357 --> 18:33.492
would set up an elaborate ruse

18:33.493 --> 18:35.761
just to teach
seven students a lesson?

18:35.762 --> 18:36.929
- Uh, yes.
- Yeah.

18:36.930 --> 18:38.230
- Yes.
- That's a Wednesday.

18:38.231 --> 18:39.648
Oh, my God.

18:39.649 --> 18:43.168
I've made a terrible mistake
coming here.

18:43.169 --> 18:45.888
So this wasn't part
of the class?

18:45.889 --> 18:47.172
Then why are you here?

18:47.173 --> 18:48.557
Because you had a test today,

18:48.558 --> 18:49.608
and you all missed it!

18:49.609 --> 18:50.893
"F"s for everyone.

18:50.894 --> 18:52.144
Oh.

18:52.145 --> 18:53.946
Maybe it's not too late

18:53.947 --> 18:55.916
to get out of my contract.

18:58.418 --> 19:00.319
- I really am Hitler.
- Yeah.

19:00.320 --> 19:03.355
So it's just decided.

19:03.356 --> 19:04.523
No vote or anything.

19:04.524 --> 19:06.091
I hate this.

19:06.092 --> 19:07.492
I wish there was a way
that we could

19:07.493 --> 19:08.644
make it up to people.

19:08.645 --> 19:10.629
That's it.

19:10.630 --> 19:13.232
We need to make reparations.

19:13.233 --> 19:15.184
We have to start giving back

19:15.185 --> 19:18.787
because Greendale
has given us so much.

19:18.788 --> 19:20.622
It gave us the study room.

19:20.623 --> 19:24.876
And that study room
is our home.

19:24.877 --> 19:29.565
But our home is more
than those four walls.

19:29.566 --> 19:34.420
And our family is more
than the seven of us.

19:34.421 --> 19:38.891
It's all of Greendale.

19:38.892 --> 19:42.144
And everyone deserves to have
what we have.

19:42.145 --> 19:44.680
[Peaceful music]

19:44.681 --> 19:45.764
What do you know?

19:45.765 --> 19:47.800
Greendale just got
slightly better.

19:51.287 --> 19:52.404
It's good to be back.

19:52.405 --> 19:54.590
Should we go celebrate
at Skeeper's?

19:54.591 --> 19:56.675
Oh, come on, Shirley.
We all have lives.

19:56.676 --> 19:57.810
There you are!

19:57.811 --> 19:59.845
I am so proud
how you stepped up

19:59.846 --> 20:00.846
and made amends.

20:00.847 --> 20:02.981
And everyone forgave you.

20:02.982 --> 20:05.017
Because when it comes
right down to it,

20:05.018 --> 20:06.718
Greendale's a forgiving place.

20:06.719 --> 20:07.936
It really is.

20:07.937 --> 20:09.721
Please keep that in mind
the next 20 seconds.

20:09.722 --> 20:11.206
Remember that people
can "Chang".

20:11.207 --> 20:12.357
People can what?

20:12.358 --> 20:14.392
Hmm?

20:14.393 --> 20:15.494
Hi, I'm Kevin.

20:15.495 --> 20:18.363
All: [Screaming]

20:18.364 --> 20:20.365
He has Changnesia.

20:22.898 --> 20:24.291
And you know what
that sound is.

20:24.292 --> 20:26.309
<i>Both:

20:34.634 --> 20:36.135
Now's the part of the show
where we get real.

20:36.136 --> 20:38.404
Friendship, loyalty,
betrayal, redemption.

20:38.405 --> 20:40.189
- Is this an apology?
- Yes.

20:40.190 --> 20:41.307
