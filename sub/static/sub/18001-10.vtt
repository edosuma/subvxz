WEBVTT

00:08.260 --> 00:10.598
I was thinking if this
comic book managing thing

00:10.632 --> 00:12.303
doesn't work out for me,

00:12.338 --> 00:16.175
like to see if I can make my,
uh, mark as a man in black.

00:16.209 --> 00:17.327
You talking about the movie.

00:17.327 --> 00:18.747
Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, what...

00:18.781 --> 00:19.750
Men In Black?

00:19.784 --> 00:21.286
I want to show up

00:21.321 --> 00:22.855
where weird and strange
events have happened,

00:22.889 --> 00:25.425
like, investigate it and then fade away.

00:25.460 --> 00:26.527
Oh, okay. Well, that's...

00:26.562 --> 00:28.327
[Laughter]

00:28.361 --> 00:30.830
Not too high of a goal to shoot for.

00:30.865 --> 00:32.534
Why? You think that's too lofty?

00:32.567 --> 00:34.506
First, they don't even acknowledge

00:34.540 --> 00:36.776
that it exists, so you couldn't go in there

00:36.811 --> 00:39.381
and be like, "I'd like to
apply to be a man in black."

00:39.415 --> 00:42.051
Well, you know, maybe... maybe
they need a new young buck,

00:42.085 --> 00:43.385
and he just... you
know, he dresses

00:43.419 --> 00:44.684
a little bit more casual, you know,

00:44.719 --> 00:45.885
maybe some little track pants.

00:45.919 --> 00:47.118
Yeah, leather jacket maybe.

00:47.153 --> 00:48.120
- Yeah, yeah...
- So wait.

00:48.154 --> 00:49.622
You're the young buck

00:49.657 --> 00:50.823
who dresses like you're in the mafia?

00:50.857 --> 00:53.960
[Laughter]

00:53.994 --> 00:55.529
I don't think this is
the career for you, dude.

00:55.563 --> 00:56.531
Yeah.

00:56.565 --> 00:58.868

01:31.962 --> 01:34.664
<i>Hello, and welcome to another
episode of Comic Book Men,</i>

01:34.699 --> 01:36.335
the only show that's not afraid

01:36.369 --> 01:39.072
to put the word "green"
in front of "arrow."

01:39.106 --> 01:40.341
I'm your host, Kevin Smith.

01:40.375 --> 01:42.076
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

01:42.111 --> 01:43.377
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

01:43.411 --> 01:44.678
Okay, man, I need to know

01:44.712 --> 01:46.213
what happened in the store this week.

01:46.248 --> 01:48.450
I know it's easy to forget, you know,

01:48.485 --> 01:51.385
but I'm kind of a straitlaced guy.

01:56.623 --> 01:58.990
So, Robert, you acquire
anything of note this week?

01:59.024 --> 02:02.560
<i>Just picked up a load of 83
Return Of The Jedi tri-logos...</i>

02:02.595 --> 02:05.217
Palitoy, which was the U.K. Version.

02:05.217 --> 02:06.249
Where'd you find 'em?

02:06.249 --> 02:08.151
- Found 'em at the market.
- What's your secret?

02:08.151 --> 02:09.324
Like, how come when I go to the market,

02:09.324 --> 02:10.711
I don't find all these gems but you do?

02:10.711 --> 02:11.893
Well, you know, the rule of thumb is,

02:11.893 --> 02:13.545
if the sun up, you're already late.

02:13.545 --> 02:14.903
- Okay, yeah, okay.
- You get into a table,

02:14.938 --> 02:16.438
you got to start checking people.

02:16.473 --> 02:17.940
I've heard rumblings down at the market.

02:17.975 --> 02:19.509
People won't even sell to you anymore

02:19.543 --> 02:21.250
- 'cause they just can't stand you.
- That's true. It's true.

02:21.250 --> 02:22.445
[Laughter]

02:22.479 --> 02:24.146
- Hi, guys.
- Hello.

02:24.180 --> 02:26.984
So I have a comic that
I'm interested in selling.

02:27.018 --> 02:29.453
- And it's definitely different.
- Okay, what is it?

02:29.487 --> 02:32.855
This is a Robert crumb 1973 comic,

02:32.889 --> 02:35.392
and it's a little risque.

02:35.426 --> 02:37.195
[Inhales sharply]-
Ooh, I don't...

02:37.229 --> 02:38.796
I-I bet you it is a little risque.

02:38.831 --> 02:40.498
Um, I've heard this is what you call

02:40.532 --> 02:42.399
an underground comic, Robert?

02:42.433 --> 02:44.165
Yes, that would be underground comic.

02:53.243 --> 02:54.576
You're looking to sell it, huh?

02:54.611 --> 02:56.277
I am; I actually used to have,

02:56.311 --> 02:58.346
uh, quite a bit of a collection
of Robert crumb stuff.

02:58.380 --> 03:00.882
And this is actually one of
the last pieces that I have,

03:00.916 --> 03:02.885
so instead of it collecting dust,

03:02.919 --> 03:05.453
I figured maybe it could find a good home.

03:05.488 --> 03:07.221
Oh, I don't know about here, though.

03:07.255 --> 03:09.554
I mean, we don't really
deal in underground comics.

03:09.588 --> 03:12.292
You know, I mean, uh,

03:12.326 --> 03:13.929
my mom would only buy me, you know,

03:13.964 --> 03:16.997
wholesome, comic
code-approved comics, and, um...

03:17.032 --> 03:18.332
got to love Robert Crumb, though.

03:18.366 --> 03:19.833
I mean, he was a man

03:19.867 --> 03:22.435
who loved a woman with some big legs

03:22.469 --> 03:23.670
and a big behind.

03:23.705 --> 03:25.337
[Laughter]

03:25.371 --> 03:27.171
I like this guy...
Uh, yeah.

03:27.206 --> 03:28.340
Uh, just even looking at the back,

03:28.374 --> 03:29.708
I just don't even think...

03:29.743 --> 03:31.612
I don't think this book is for me, guys.

03:31.646 --> 03:33.849
Um, I'm out. All right, guys?

03:33.883 --> 03:35.852
- You're offended by that?
- I'm not offended by it.

03:35.886 --> 03:37.888
I just know I'm not
interested in it, though.

03:37.922 --> 03:39.723
- Look how uncomfortable he is.
- I know.

03:39.757 --> 03:42.457
That's how it is. I'm
a comics code guy, man.

03:42.492 --> 03:44.126
- Comics code...
- I-i understand.

03:44.160 --> 03:45.362
Get out of here... [chuckles]

03:45.396 --> 03:46.630
Square.

03:46.664 --> 03:48.897
[Laughter]

03:48.932 --> 03:51.001
Since the time I started reading comics,

03:51.035 --> 03:54.239
I've led a code-approved life.

03:54.273 --> 03:55.239
Right, I mean... I mean...

03:55.273 --> 03:56.872
I'm only laughing

03:56.906 --> 03:58.173
'cause I thought about
it for a split second.

03:58.207 --> 03:59.742
I was like, "he did. He has."

03:59.777 --> 04:01.077
That explains everything.

04:01.112 --> 04:02.879
[Laughter]

04:02.914 --> 04:05.948
The comics code laid down a Foundation

04:05.982 --> 04:08.915
of Dos and Don'ts that I
still follow to this day.

04:08.950 --> 04:10.850
Not all of 'em, though.

04:10.885 --> 04:12.685
One of 'em was, "you can't
say the word 'zombie.'"

04:12.720 --> 04:14.221
I heard him say "zombie."

04:14.255 --> 04:17.257
I hear you say "zombie" all the time.

04:17.291 --> 04:19.957
How did you get into the,
uh, underground comic scene?

04:19.992 --> 04:21.426
I'm originally from Vegas,

04:21.459 --> 04:24.431
so, like, those types
of, you know, "genres,"

04:24.465 --> 04:26.234
that was natural for us.

04:26.268 --> 04:28.737
That was, like, definitely a normal thing.

04:28.771 --> 04:31.036
But, like, Robert crumb,
I mean, he draws women

04:31.070 --> 04:33.369
that look like me,

04:33.404 --> 04:35.907
and nobody in comics does that, you know?

04:35.941 --> 04:37.109
I'm sorry, I didn't
even know it was legal

04:37.143 --> 04:38.377
to raise kids in Vegas.

04:38.411 --> 04:40.580
[Laughter]

04:40.614 --> 04:42.115
So why are you looking
to sell this today?

04:42.149 --> 04:44.452
I had a collection of these

04:44.486 --> 04:46.289
that I collected with my ex-boyfriend.

04:46.323 --> 04:48.158
And at this point,

04:48.193 --> 04:49.794
it's kind of a bad memory,

04:49.828 --> 04:52.462
and I don't want to see it anymore.

04:52.496 --> 04:53.730
I got to be honest with you.

04:53.764 --> 04:55.298
Like, I don't think the store

04:55.333 --> 04:56.736
would be really interested in this.

04:56.770 --> 04:58.239
- Okay.
- I mean, for one reason only.

04:58.274 --> 05:00.272
It's, like, adults only.

05:00.306 --> 05:01.405
Maybe you'd be interested in this.

05:01.440 --> 05:02.406
- I mean...
- Definitely.

05:02.440 --> 05:03.806
What's the price on it?

05:03.841 --> 05:05.408
I mean, that's... price is everything.

05:05.442 --> 05:07.244
[Sighs] I've been lookin' online.

05:07.279 --> 05:10.479
And I don't know, maybe, like, 50 bucks.

05:10.513 --> 05:12.177
50 bucks.

05:12.212 --> 05:15.344
Uh, there are a lot of crumb
books that go for money.

05:15.378 --> 05:18.246
The thing with underground
comic books is their printings.

05:18.280 --> 05:20.481
This, I could tell you right
now, is not an early printing.

05:20.515 --> 05:23.615
This was published after probably '89.

05:23.650 --> 05:26.150
Could have very well
been published in 2004.

05:26.185 --> 05:28.085
They're still publishing this book.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.086
Um, that being the case,

05:30.120 --> 05:33.354
you could probably go
online and buy it for $10.

05:33.388 --> 05:35.188
- Well...
- What do you think?

05:35.222 --> 05:36.957
We can take it off her hands,
maybe get this bad memory...

05:36.992 --> 05:38.026
I-I'd give you ten bucks for it.

05:38.061 --> 05:39.429
I-I have a few of these.

05:39.463 --> 05:40.931
I don't have this particular issue

05:40.965 --> 05:42.801
just 'cause it's so new.

05:42.835 --> 05:45.303
As long as you promise me
it's gonna go to a good home...

05:45.337 --> 05:46.670
- Absolutely, 100%.
- I'm good with that.

05:46.704 --> 05:48.172
- $10?
- I'm good with that, yeah.

05:48.206 --> 05:49.976
- Awesome.
- He doesn't even have it.

05:50.011 --> 05:51.145
Probably doesn't have it.

05:51.179 --> 05:52.681
[Laughter]

05:52.715 --> 05:54.783
- $10 bill.
- Excellent.

05:54.817 --> 05:56.185
Thanks. Have a good day.

05:56.219 --> 05:57.689
All right, Robert,
now get that out of here

05:57.723 --> 06:00.327
before you taint the
reputation of the store.

06:00.361 --> 06:01.529
Hey, guys.

06:01.563 --> 06:02.865
- Mr. Adams.
- Good to see you.

06:02.899 --> 06:04.761
How are you? Mr. Neal Adams, Walt.

06:05.179 --> 06:06.100
Oh, it's an honor.

06:06.100 --> 06:07.300
- I'm a gigantic fan.
- It's a pleasure.

06:13.637 --> 06:15.273
<i>Let's load up on the crisis identity.</i>

06:15.307 --> 06:16.508
Okay.

06:16.542 --> 06:17.776
<i>Uh, Green Lanterns.</i>

06:17.973 --> 06:20.040
- All the 52s, yeah.
- Got ya.

06:20.074 --> 06:21.741
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, how are you?

06:21.776 --> 06:23.509
<i>Talkin' about Green Lantern. Good thing.</i>

06:23.544 --> 06:25.144
- Mr. Adams.
- Good to see you.

06:25.178 --> 06:26.846
How are you? Mr. Neal Adams, Walt.

06:26.880 --> 06:28.448
Oh, it's an honor.

06:28.483 --> 06:29.717
- I'm a gigantic fan.
- It's a pleasure.

06:29.751 --> 06:31.386
Neal Adams...

06:31.420 --> 06:34.490
if there's a mount rushmore
of comic book creators,

06:34.524 --> 06:36.456
Neal Adams is probably up there, man.

06:36.490 --> 06:37.993
He's a total living legend

06:38.027 --> 06:40.132
and has forgotten more about this medium

06:40.167 --> 06:42.200
than most folks will ever know.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.901
I've had him on the
podcast fat man on Batman

06:43.936 --> 06:45.013
a couple times.

06:45.013 --> 06:47.452
Absolutely this is one of those perks

06:47.452 --> 06:48.944
about working in a comic book store

06:48.944 --> 06:51.344
to have someone of Neal
Adams' caliber to come in.

06:51.378 --> 06:53.211
I mean, every piece of work he's done,

06:53.245 --> 06:55.012
it seems like, is an iconic piece

06:55.047 --> 06:57.180
of, uh, comic book history.

06:57.214 --> 06:58.946
The guy created, uh,

06:58.980 --> 07:00.949
big pieces of comic book history.

07:00.983 --> 07:05.083
The guy lived big chunks
of comic book history.

07:05.117 --> 07:06.350
I thought maybe you could help me.

07:06.385 --> 07:08.085
I just got an assignment from DC Comics,

07:08.119 --> 07:10.054
and I find myself a little bit lost,

07:10.089 --> 07:11.724
because I'm doing a Superman: New Gods.

07:11.758 --> 07:13.193
Oh, cool.

07:13.228 --> 07:14.931
But, uh, I don't have a lot of reference

07:14.965 --> 07:16.532
<i>of Jack Kirby's New Gods.</i>

07:16.566 --> 07:18.132
So maybe you got some Kirby stuff...

07:18.167 --> 07:21.072
<i>- Uh...
- Some new God stuff.</i>

07:21.106 --> 07:22.774
Yeah, I know we do. In
the back, there's shipments.

07:22.808 --> 07:24.276
Yeah, let me go, uh...
let me go grab it for you.

07:24.310 --> 07:25.744
Okay.

07:25.778 --> 07:28.647
He was there for some reference material

07:28.683 --> 07:30.952
about Superman and Jack Kirby's New Gods.

07:30.987 --> 07:32.353
The New Gods were a creation

07:32.388 --> 07:34.686
of the great Jack "king" Kirby himself.

07:34.721 --> 07:36.455
He'd been at Marvel forever,

07:36.489 --> 07:39.357
came over to DC, and created characters

07:39.391 --> 07:41.092
with, like, almost shakespearean,

07:41.126 --> 07:44.029
almost Marvel-type backstories.

07:44.063 --> 07:46.433
It's not only Marvel-like.
It's biblical-like.

07:46.467 --> 07:49.234
Very much, yeah, straight
out the Bible kind of.

07:49.269 --> 07:50.734
Well, hence New Gods.

07:50.768 --> 07:52.603
[Laughter]

07:52.638 --> 07:55.409
They even sensed it back in the day.

07:55.443 --> 07:57.974
- I am dying to ask you a question.
- Okay.

07:58.009 --> 07:59.108
Could you give us just a...

07:59.143 --> 08:01.645
just a glimpse, an... an insight,

08:01.645 --> 08:02.611
into what it was like...

08:02.645 --> 08:03.842
- Back in the day?
- Back in the days?

08:03.876 --> 08:05.275
I can.

08:05.310 --> 08:07.278
In fact, I can show
you some of the artwork.

08:07.313 --> 08:08.916
- Ooh.
- Hold on a second.

08:08.950 --> 08:10.853
Okay?
Okay. What do you got?

08:10.888 --> 08:12.257
- This is a reprint...
- Oh, yeah.

08:12.291 --> 08:13.694
<i>Of Superman versus Muhammad Ali.</i>

08:13.728 --> 08:15.396
- You remember...
- I remember it well.

08:15.430 --> 08:17.166
That it had all of these people...

08:17.201 --> 08:18.769
President of the United States.

08:18.803 --> 08:20.304
That was supposed to be Telly Savalas,

08:20.338 --> 08:21.840
but, uh, I turned it into Luthor

08:21.874 --> 08:23.475
because he didn't want to be on the cover,

08:23.509 --> 08:25.211
so I took a lollipop out of his hand,

08:25.245 --> 08:26.780
and I marked it to be Luthor.

08:26.815 --> 08:28.516
Did you pick who you got to put on here?

08:28.550 --> 08:30.019
I picked, but what happened was,

08:30.054 --> 08:31.220
the lawyers had to write the people

08:31.255 --> 08:32.386
to get their permission.

08:32.422 --> 08:34.157
And then some of them said no.

08:34.192 --> 08:35.991
So John Wayne, for example, said no,

08:36.027 --> 08:37.226
so I put a mustache on him.

08:37.260 --> 08:38.826
[Laughter]

08:38.860 --> 08:40.294
That's a easy way to
get around that.

08:40.328 --> 08:41.730
That's right.

08:41.765 --> 08:43.900
I have to say one of
my most iconic memories.

08:43.933 --> 08:46.303
I remember where I
was the day saw it...

08:46.337 --> 08:49.711
Was Batman with a hairy chest and nipples.

08:49.745 --> 08:51.213
You know, I'd never seen
that in comics before.

08:51.247 --> 08:52.881
In fact, as far as I know,

08:52.916 --> 08:55.518
there were no hairy chests and nipples.

08:55.552 --> 08:57.253
You-you brought
such a sense of realism.

08:57.287 --> 08:59.322
And it was just... it was amazing.
Well, the...

08:59.357 --> 09:02.391
the comic books were kind of
cartoony in those days.

09:02.425 --> 09:06.031
Yet for me, drawing hair
on the chest of a man

09:06.065 --> 09:08.167
seemed to be the most
obvious thing in the world.

09:08.202 --> 09:10.037
Suddenly, here was our guy coming along,

09:10.071 --> 09:12.340
drawing reality the way
it is in a comic book,

09:12.375 --> 09:14.543
and that shook everybody up.

09:14.577 --> 09:16.276
Pecs and a hairy chest, it's so weird.

09:16.310 --> 09:18.011
That's always captured your imagination.

09:18.046 --> 09:19.247
For as many years as I've known you,

09:19.282 --> 09:20.750
you've always been like,

09:20.784 --> 09:22.351
"one time, they took Batman's shirt off,

09:22.385 --> 09:24.555
and that was real."

09:24.589 --> 09:26.191
Yeah, I've never forgotten that panel,

09:26.225 --> 09:27.856
because it was like...

09:27.891 --> 09:32.127
It was like Batman finally
looked like a human being.

09:32.162 --> 09:35.034
I mean, he just, he knew
how to make dynamic covers

09:35.069 --> 09:37.403
that made you want to open
up the book to get inside,

09:37.437 --> 09:40.206
and once you were inside,
his storytelling was flawless.

09:40.241 --> 09:41.740
And his art was very realistic.

09:41.775 --> 09:43.308
He made you believe in Batman.

09:43.343 --> 09:44.744
Oh, yeah.

09:44.778 --> 09:45.946
I happen to have some of the artwork

09:45.980 --> 09:47.215
in my portfolio.

09:47.249 --> 09:49.151
Okay, let's take a look at it.

09:49.185 --> 09:50.919
You can see what fills
this stupid thing up.

09:50.953 --> 09:52.921
- Wow.
- Wow.

09:52.955 --> 09:54.888
<i>This is, uh, of course, the Batman Joker</i>

09:54.922 --> 09:56.822
that Denny O'Neil and I did,

09:56.857 --> 09:59.592
and I think you'd have to say
that it led to, uh, the movie.

09:59.627 --> 10:01.261
Yeah, definitely.

10:01.296 --> 10:03.565
And this, that is
the worst drawn cover

10:03.599 --> 10:04.634
I've ever done.

10:04.668 --> 10:06.335
How so?

10:06.370 --> 10:08.003
I had to stretch his leg
to go around the lettering.

10:08.037 --> 10:09.537
- Ah.
- [Chuckles]

10:09.571 --> 10:11.439
It's badly done, but everybody loves it.

10:11.474 --> 10:13.704
I cannot stand that cover. [Shudders]

10:13.738 --> 10:15.371
Just gives me the trembly-wemblies.

10:15.405 --> 10:16.939
- [Laughing]
- But there you go.

10:16.973 --> 10:18.274
- That they like it.
- What about this one?

10:18.308 --> 10:19.609
This one is just...

10:19.643 --> 10:21.769
- It's shocking.
- It's jarring.

10:21.769 --> 10:23.345
It's still jarring even
to this to this day.

10:23.345 --> 10:24.184
It is. It is.

10:24.218 --> 10:25.485
If it seemed like hair on a guy's chest

10:25.519 --> 10:27.051
was life-changing, what was this?

10:27.085 --> 10:29.319
Uh, it made... it put me
on the straight and narrow.

10:29.353 --> 10:31.454
I have never touched drugs.

10:31.488 --> 10:33.023
That is a brilliant cover...

10:33.057 --> 10:35.993
the hard-traveling heroes
saga, uh, in which speedy,

10:36.028 --> 10:38.329
the Green Arrow's young sidekick,

10:38.363 --> 10:39.794
who's caught using heroin...

10:39.829 --> 10:41.830
for the first time in comic books,

10:41.865 --> 10:44.000
superheroes dealt with some real issues.

10:44.034 --> 10:46.201
These are absolute masterworks.

10:46.235 --> 10:48.137
Guys, I can't thank you enough.

10:48.171 --> 10:49.874
I appreciate the Jack Kirby stuff.

10:49.908 --> 10:51.275
You have no idea.

10:51.310 --> 10:52.842
I promise to do the best job I can,

10:52.876 --> 10:54.609
and I hope you guys are
happy with what I do.

10:54.644 --> 10:55.845
And I appreciate it very, very much.

10:55.879 --> 10:56.948
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

10:56.982 --> 10:58.317
- Oh, my God.
- Thank you.

10:58.352 --> 10:59.854
- Thank you.
- It was an honor.

10:59.888 --> 11:03.024
I have these 1966 Batman Nite-Lites.

11:03.059 --> 11:04.993
Whoa. They're on card.

11:05.028 --> 11:07.199
I have some cool 1970 Matchbox cars

11:07.233 --> 11:08.401
that I thought you'd be interested in.

11:08.435 --> 11:09.436
Oh, wow.

11:10.750 --> 11:11.982
Joining us at the table,

11:12.016 --> 11:13.848
one of the greatest American
writers there ever was,

11:13.882 --> 11:15.114
- Denny O'Neil!
- Yeah.

11:15.149 --> 11:17.753
- [Applause]
- Um, I wanted to ask you,

11:17.787 --> 11:21.457
those amazing Green Lantern
books you did with Neal Adams,

11:21.491 --> 11:24.961
did you have any idea that they
would still be relevant today?

11:24.996 --> 11:27.198
We kind of knew we
were pushing the envelope,

11:27.232 --> 11:29.065
and we were getting a lot of attention.

11:29.099 --> 11:33.401
But after all, I was
getting the same $15 a page.

11:33.435 --> 11:36.103
15 bucks a page to write
hard-traveling heroes?

11:36.138 --> 11:37.607
That's amazing.

11:37.641 --> 11:41.307
I could not have conceived
that those stories would appear

11:41.342 --> 11:44.743
in a $75 hardcover

11:44.778 --> 11:46.745
and I would be asked to speak
at the library of congress.

11:46.779 --> 11:49.146
- Oh.
- Even if you don't like them,

11:49.180 --> 11:52.885
comics have become part
of the fabric of America.

11:52.920 --> 11:55.087
They are part of our common experience.

11:55.121 --> 11:56.489
Yeah, no doubt.

11:56.523 --> 11:58.457
The amazing Denny O'Neil, gentlemen.

11:58.491 --> 12:00.992
[Applause]

12:09.211 --> 12:10.611
- How you doing?
- Hey, guys.

12:10.646 --> 12:11.836
- How are you?
- Good.

12:11.836 --> 12:16.238
Um, I have these 1966
Batman Snapit Nite-Lites

12:16.273 --> 12:18.273
that I thought you might be interested in.

12:18.307 --> 12:20.841
- Really?
- Yes.

12:20.875 --> 12:23.107
Whoa. They're on card.

12:23.141 --> 12:24.540
Yes.

12:31.754 --> 12:34.957
Unbelievable. Look at
the shape of the card.

12:34.991 --> 12:38.331
It looks like it just came
out of the box in 1966.

12:38.365 --> 12:39.631
Where did you get these?

12:39.666 --> 12:41.731
I got them at a yard sale.

12:41.765 --> 12:44.098
Wow. This is an awesome piece.

12:44.132 --> 12:46.934
I mean, what is the first thing
you think of when you see this?

12:46.968 --> 12:49.068
That 25,000 hours have probably passed.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.836
They don't work.

12:50.870 --> 12:52.738
I don't know, 'cause
that's a lot of hours.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.841
Actually, I've tested a few,
because I have some extras,

12:54.875 --> 12:56.142
and they do still work.

12:56.177 --> 12:57.610
- Oh, yeah?
- Really?

12:57.644 --> 12:59.275
The first thing I think of is,

12:59.310 --> 13:01.173
this just screams a different era.

13:01.208 --> 13:02.943
I don't know why.
Yeah.

13:02.977 --> 13:05.247
There's just something about
the design that just says,

13:05.282 --> 13:06.415
"made in America."

13:06.450 --> 13:07.450
[Chuckling]

13:07.484 --> 13:08.919
And it do oh!

13:08.953 --> 13:10.790
- Is it? Oh, yeah.
- Look at that.

13:10.825 --> 13:12.129
- What up?
- I called it.

13:12.163 --> 13:14.829
[Laughter]

13:14.863 --> 13:15.865
Wait a second.

13:15.899 --> 13:16.867
Is it a Batman's head

13:16.902 --> 13:17.869
with wings next to it?

13:17.904 --> 13:19.272
- Yes.
- Cowl?

13:19.307 --> 13:20.939
- That was my night
- Light growing up, man,

13:20.974 --> 13:22.441
and I still have it today.

13:22.475 --> 13:24.611
And if you plug it in
the wall, it still works.

13:24.645 --> 13:26.379
- The original bulb?
- Original bulb.

13:26.413 --> 13:28.012
Isn't that crazy?
That's astonishing.

13:28.047 --> 13:29.781
That's when they made...

13:29.815 --> 13:31.215
- They made stuff to last.
- Made stuff to last.

13:31.249 --> 13:33.717
How much was it originally sold for?

13:33.752 --> 13:35.720
- 79¢.
- Really?

13:35.754 --> 13:37.320
It's just so weird to know

13:37.354 --> 13:39.188
that that thing I've had all my life,

13:39.222 --> 13:41.157
my parents spent 79¢ for it.

13:41.191 --> 13:43.692
It's probably the thing
that has lasted the longest.

13:43.726 --> 13:45.959
That may have been the best 79¢

13:45.994 --> 13:47.194
your parents ever...

13:47.228 --> 13:48.996
Yeah, I think you're right.

13:49.031 --> 13:50.900
- Put down for, right?
- You may be absolutely right.

13:50.934 --> 13:53.236
I can't think of anything
except maybe food.

13:53.271 --> 13:55.006
- Just medicine.
- Yeah, medicine.

13:55.040 --> 13:58.077
[Laughter]

13:58.111 --> 13:59.878
- Did you have a night
- Light when you were a kid?

13:59.912 --> 14:02.079
- I have vague memories of having a night
- Light

14:02.114 --> 14:04.385
for my three-,
four-year-old stage.

14:04.419 --> 14:06.751
Once I got into kindergarten,
though, I was like, "no way.

14:06.785 --> 14:08.319
I cannot have a night-light.
I'm way too old."

14:08.353 --> 14:09.487
"If this gets out, I'm finished."

14:09.522 --> 14:10.889
Yes.

14:10.923 --> 14:12.223
What about you? Did
you have a night-light?

14:12.257 --> 14:13.357
- Yeah, I had a little night
- Light

14:13.392 --> 14:14.658
with, uh, Mickey mouse on it.

14:14.693 --> 14:16.327
- Still use it?
- Uh, not for myself.

14:16.362 --> 14:18.197
They're for my kids, you
know, but, you know...

14:18.231 --> 14:20.333
I mean, who better, when
like, if you're a young kid,

14:20.367 --> 14:21.867
you know, you're a
little scared of the dark,

14:21.902 --> 14:23.704
what's underneath the bed,

14:23.738 --> 14:25.507
wouldn't you want the dark
knight right by your nightstand,

14:25.541 --> 14:27.275
safeguarding you through
the night while you slept?

14:27.309 --> 14:28.943
If I'm such a simpleton

14:28.978 --> 14:31.247
that I think he's gonna
protect me from anything,

14:31.281 --> 14:32.781
I need all of these.

14:32.815 --> 14:34.850
[Laughter]

14:34.884 --> 14:37.188
- I'm 44, and I still night
- Light it.

14:37.222 --> 14:39.023
You know, we all have smartphones

14:39.058 --> 14:40.360
that have lights built into 'em.

14:40.394 --> 14:41.895
What is that if not a night-light?

14:41.929 --> 14:43.095
But do you leave it on all night?

14:43.129 --> 14:44.962
[Laughter]

14:44.997 --> 14:47.064
It's definitely a night-light.
Good point, good point.

14:47.098 --> 14:48.197
Do you panic when it's not on?

14:48.232 --> 14:49.698
No. Good point.

14:49.732 --> 14:51.931
I'm not like, "Jen,
turn on my night-light."

14:51.965 --> 14:54.734
[Laughter]

14:54.768 --> 14:56.203
So why you lookin' to sell it today?

14:56.237 --> 14:57.737
Well, I'm moving,

14:57.772 --> 15:00.071
and I have a very large collection.

15:00.106 --> 15:02.779
And I... I'm looking to
downsize a little bit.

15:02.813 --> 15:04.112
What are you lookin' to get for 'em?

15:04.147 --> 15:06.647
I'd like to get $1,000.

15:06.682 --> 15:08.552
$1,000, huh?

15:08.587 --> 15:09.955
It's a very rare piece,

15:09.990 --> 15:11.459
fully intact.

15:11.493 --> 15:13.659
Would you take $600 for it?

15:13.693 --> 15:16.195
That's a little bit too low.

15:16.230 --> 15:18.730
Ah, how about $850?

15:18.765 --> 15:21.298
I love it, though,
man. It really is cool.

15:21.332 --> 15:22.766
You won't find another set like this.

15:22.801 --> 15:24.136
You really won't.

15:24.170 --> 15:25.772
I got a feeling you're right.

15:25.806 --> 15:30.878
And there may not be 100
of these in the worldwide.

15:30.912 --> 15:33.248
How about $700?

15:33.282 --> 15:35.016
I'm thinking $800.

15:35.051 --> 15:37.520
Thinking $800?

15:37.555 --> 15:38.689
How about you meet me in the middle?

15:38.723 --> 15:41.927
How about $750?

15:41.961 --> 15:43.029
Yeah, okay.

15:43.063 --> 15:44.833
Deal.

15:48.205 --> 15:50.572
All right, $750. There you go.

15:50.606 --> 15:52.072
Both: Thank you so much.

15:52.105 --> 15:53.738
- You have a great day, guys.
- Thank you.

15:53.772 --> 15:54.839
Both: Thank you.

15:54.873 --> 15:56.676
Oh, wow, Matchbox cars.

15:56.710 --> 15:58.244
Remember Matchbox cars?
I remember them well.

15:58.278 --> 15:59.946
I think I had this one.

15:59.980 --> 16:01.347
What are you lookin'
to get for 'em today?

16:01.382 --> 16:02.381
How about, uh...

16:09.690 --> 16:11.256
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

16:11.291 --> 16:12.557
- Have a good day.
- Yeah.

16:12.592 --> 16:13.659
- How you doing?
- Hey, how are you?

16:13.693 --> 16:14.137
Good.

16:14.137 --> 16:16.363
I have some cool 1970 Matchbox cars

16:16.551 --> 16:17.985
that I thought you'd be interested in.

16:18.019 --> 16:20.118
- Oh, wow, Matchbox cars.
- Yeah.

16:20.152 --> 16:22.523
- You remember Matchbox cars?
- I remember them well.

16:27.597 --> 16:29.263
Take a look at 'em.
They're really unique.

16:29.297 --> 16:30.665
- Yeah, what do you got here?
- Take a look.

16:30.700 --> 16:32.201
- What do you got?
- Some really good ones.

16:32.235 --> 16:34.042
That's like a dune buggy.

16:34.042 --> 16:36.210
Got a Volkswagen van,

16:36.244 --> 16:38.848
one of my favorites, the dump truck,

16:38.883 --> 16:41.251
and the double-Decker bus.

16:41.285 --> 16:42.619
I remember this one,
I think I had this one.

16:42.653 --> 16:44.353
This is an interesting choice for a kid.

16:44.388 --> 16:47.089
It you know, as opposed
to, like, a race car,

16:47.124 --> 16:48.459
it's like, "all right, we're
gonna go on tour

16:48.493 --> 16:49.795
around swinging London."

16:49.829 --> 16:52.198
- Yeah.
- Right, right.

16:52.232 --> 16:53.734
Why is the dump truck your favorite?

16:53.768 --> 16:55.403
Well, I mean, what kid
doesn't like growing up

16:55.437 --> 16:56.571
and playing with a dump truck?

16:56.605 --> 16:58.451
- I mean...
- Work construction?

16:58.451 --> 16:59.147
- Nah.
- No.

16:59.147 --> 17:00.041
Just because I'm Italian

17:00.075 --> 17:01.310
doesn't mean I work construction.

17:01.344 --> 17:02.711
I thought, you know,
maybe a no-show.

17:02.746 --> 17:04.047
- I don't know.
- Yeah, yeah.

17:04.080 --> 17:05.714
[Laughter]

17:05.749 --> 17:07.851
That's a good one. That's a good one.

17:07.885 --> 17:09.923
[Laughter]

17:09.957 --> 17:11.692
Did you have a favorite
Matchbox car growing up?

17:11.726 --> 17:13.694
No, Matchboxes weren't my thing.

17:13.729 --> 17:15.329
I had 'em. I played with them, you know.

17:15.364 --> 17:17.066
But I... usually I got bored doing this.

17:17.101 --> 17:19.002
[Laughs]

17:19.037 --> 17:20.903
I'd be like, "that's
it? That's all it does?"

17:20.936 --> 17:22.438
It just didn't do anything for me.

17:22.473 --> 17:24.743
"Ooh, I'm an intellectual. Look at me.

17:24.780 --> 17:26.047
I need stimulation."

17:26.082 --> 17:27.749
[Laughter]

17:27.782 --> 17:29.418
Growing up, man, the Matchbox was always

17:29.452 --> 17:32.290
the Pepsi of toy cars.

17:32.324 --> 17:33.692
You know, the coke...
the creme de la creme...

17:33.727 --> 17:34.695
was hot wheels.

17:34.729 --> 17:36.095
Oh, really?

17:36.130 --> 17:37.565
There was one more sought
after than the other?

17:37.599 --> 17:40.402
Absolutely. Hot wheels was all flash.

17:40.436 --> 17:42.868
It redefined it and made it an art form,

17:42.902 --> 17:44.235
made it sexy.

17:44.270 --> 17:45.569
Matchbox always sold you...

17:45.604 --> 17:46.937
like, "here's a horse and buggy.

17:46.972 --> 17:48.572
"Here's... here's
something your dad

17:48.606 --> 17:50.439
once went on a date on."

17:50.473 --> 17:53.545
All right, but wasn't Matchbox
preparing young kids, though,

17:53.579 --> 17:56.080
for more reality of driving a vehicle

17:56.114 --> 17:57.982
than... than... than hot
wheels may have been?

17:58.016 --> 18:00.782
Absolutely, but who wants
to play with a real toy?

18:00.816 --> 18:02.316
Like, no, when you're playing,

18:02.350 --> 18:04.318
you want to be like, "vrrah, rrah, vroom,"

18:04.352 --> 18:07.287
not like, "this is a safe, affordable car."

18:07.321 --> 18:08.923
"This car's good on gas."

18:08.957 --> 18:10.425
[Laughter]

18:10.459 --> 18:12.261
They're in very good condition.

18:12.295 --> 18:14.629
- Did you play with them a lot?
- I did play with them, yeah.

18:14.664 --> 18:16.130
Did you... did you keep 'em
in this box all the time?

18:16.164 --> 18:17.565
Yes, and if you look,

18:17.599 --> 18:19.169
there's still the original paperwork

18:19.203 --> 18:22.173
that the box came in, so it's an original

18:22.207 --> 18:24.274
and a really unique piece, I think.

18:24.342 --> 18:26.009
Yeah, my mom wouldn't
buy me the vinyl box.

18:26.044 --> 18:29.281
Like, she would buy me
the cars but not the box.

18:29.316 --> 18:30.883
Not only that. I was...

18:30.918 --> 18:32.954
I was very protective of them.

18:32.988 --> 18:34.688
I didn't want 'em to get dented.

18:34.723 --> 18:36.222
I didn't want any of the
paint to get flaked off.

18:36.256 --> 18:37.690
So what'd you keep your cars in?

18:37.725 --> 18:39.294
- I
- I used a tissue box.

18:39.329 --> 18:41.162
[Laughter]

18:41.196 --> 18:43.132
The saddest carrying case of all,

18:43.166 --> 18:44.834
the Howard Hughes
carrying case...

18:44.868 --> 18:46.535
you're shuffling around. Did
you save your urine as well?

18:46.570 --> 18:47.905
Uh, no.

18:47.939 --> 18:49.206
I wanted that thing when I was a kid.

18:49.241 --> 18:50.741
My mom thought it was a waste of money.

18:50.775 --> 18:52.241
She's like, "you already
got the cars already."

18:52.276 --> 18:54.375
So I would take the tissues from the box

18:54.409 --> 18:56.675
and wrap them in the tissue paper

18:56.710 --> 18:58.477
and keeping 'em in pristine condition.

18:58.511 --> 19:00.811
This is something out of dickens, man.

19:00.845 --> 19:03.213
Like, that's adorable
and sad at the same time.

19:03.247 --> 19:04.248
And funny.

19:04.282 --> 19:06.017
[Laughter]

19:06.051 --> 19:08.852
Why on earth are you selling
a piece of your childhood?

19:08.886 --> 19:10.756
Well, I have two girls.
They're ten and six.

19:10.790 --> 19:14.232
So my house is starting to become engrossed

19:14.266 --> 19:17.503
in more and more princess stuff,
and I need to make some room.

19:17.537 --> 19:20.709
I mean, that's why I want
look to make a deal today.

19:20.743 --> 19:23.245
Have never really stocked
a Matchbox or a hot wheels

19:23.279 --> 19:25.081
at the stash, have we?

19:25.115 --> 19:27.118
No, but I think they're
definitely collectible, though.

19:27.152 --> 19:28.890
So what are you looking
to get for 'em today?

19:28.924 --> 19:31.627
Uh, reasonably... I mean,
I've done some homework...

19:31.661 --> 19:33.962
I think in the area around $150

19:33.997 --> 19:36.531
with the... with the
case and the paperwork.

19:36.566 --> 19:37.968
I think that's a fair amount.

19:38.003 --> 19:39.370
$150, huh?

19:39.405 --> 19:41.305
I mean, and that's how many cars?

19:41.339 --> 19:43.140
- We're looking at 12 cars.
- 12 cars.

19:43.174 --> 19:44.609
Is anybody really gonna
buy these little things

19:44.644 --> 19:45.980
for... for 20 bucks, 15 bucks even?

19:46.015 --> 19:47.549
These are like loose action figures.

19:47.584 --> 19:49.650
I don't know. Uh...

19:49.685 --> 19:51.284
Would you take 50 bucks for it?

19:51.318 --> 19:52.883
Ah, $50 is too low.

19:52.917 --> 19:56.054
How about, uh, buck and a quarter?

19:56.089 --> 19:57.924
I'd love to get it for less than $100.

19:57.958 --> 19:59.493
I really would.
Come on.

19:59.527 --> 20:02.766
The case alone is probably
worth at least $25, $30.

20:02.800 --> 20:05.502
He even told you he carried
his in a... in a tissue box.

20:05.536 --> 20:07.840
He's pathetic, though. We all know that.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.145
- That's not it.
- That's no example to go by.

20:10.179 --> 20:11.478
[Laughter]

20:11.513 --> 20:13.344
$90.

20:13.379 --> 20:15.079
$90, cash.

20:15.114 --> 20:17.017
- Let's do it, 90 bucks.
- 90 bucks? All right.

20:17.051 --> 20:18.817
- Yeah, sounds good.
- All right.

20:20.185 --> 20:21.518
Thank you.
Thanks a lot.

20:21.552 --> 20:22.619
All right, man, have a great day.

20:22.653 --> 20:26.321
Have a great day.

20:26.356 --> 20:28.457
That case is old
enough where I know...

20:28.492 --> 20:30.260
you can't walk in at any store and be like,

20:30.294 --> 20:31.931
"oh, I want to buy that old Matchbox case,"

20:31.966 --> 20:33.666
so when you see it,

20:33.701 --> 20:35.167
especially if it's in a decent condition

20:35.202 --> 20:36.669
and it's filled with
some cars, take a shot.

20:36.703 --> 20:38.304
You already sold it to Ming for $700.

20:38.338 --> 20:39.772
[Laughter]

20:39.806 --> 20:41.172
I finally got it.
