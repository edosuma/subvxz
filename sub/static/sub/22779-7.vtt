00:06.339 --> 00:09.467
"Furrier Morgan Printz
returned to Omaha today

00:09.551 --> 00:11.720
after a business trip to Chicago.

00:12.220 --> 00:13.680
Mr. Printz said,

00:13.763 --> 00:16.891
'It was 40 degrees cold up there,
and this being summer,

00:16.975 --> 00:19.894
I'm mighty glad
to be back home in Nebraska.'"

00:20.812 --> 00:24.858
Well, you can cross Omaha
off my list of exciting places to visit.

00:24.941 --> 00:26.317
And that's on their front page?

00:27.110 --> 00:28.695
What's going on in Taos?

00:37.704 --> 00:40.623
It seems Mr. Grigg wrote about us.

00:40.707 --> 00:41.541
[Charlotte] Us?

00:42.834 --> 00:45.253
-Really?
-"The Secret of La Belle."

00:45.795 --> 00:47.630
Oh, well, now.

00:48.798 --> 00:50.508
"The mining town of La Belle,

00:50.592 --> 00:52.385
once a vibrant community,

00:52.469 --> 00:55.096
suffered an unimaginable loss
two years ago

00:55.180 --> 00:57.849
when 200 men died in the mine
in a single day."

00:57.932 --> 00:58.767
Two hundred?

00:58.850 --> 01:03.146
"Today, the town is a gulch of shacks,
tents and derailed cars,

01:03.229 --> 01:05.940
its main street a continuous mudhole.

01:06.024 --> 01:08.234
I personally saw two wrecked rigs

01:08.318 --> 01:10.278
and three dead horses down the cliff."

01:10.361 --> 01:11.571
Derailed cars?

01:12.238 --> 01:14.491
-There's not even a damn train here.
-Dear God.

01:14.574 --> 01:15.575
Keep reading.

01:16.618 --> 01:18.411
"Well, as the old saying goes,

01:18.495 --> 01:20.455
it takes a mine to work a mine,

01:20.538 --> 01:23.875
and silver has always been
a tricky ore to monetize.

01:23.958 --> 01:26.461
Even hay goes for $60 a ton these days,

01:26.544 --> 01:28.171
so it's no wonder the town,

01:28.254 --> 01:32.675
now nearly exclusively inhabited
by widows, is so dirt poor.

01:33.968 --> 01:36.179
It's also no wonder these desperate ladies

01:36.262 --> 01:39.224
would be so willing
to harbor a desperate young man,

01:39.307 --> 01:41.476
despite his notorious repute."

01:42.018 --> 01:43.353
What desperate young man?

01:45.647 --> 01:48.024
"You can only imagine
this reporter's surprise

01:48.108 --> 01:50.026
upon learning that it is here in La Belle,

01:50.110 --> 01:53.780
among the spinsters,
children, and the few broken men,

01:53.863 --> 01:57.367
that the notorious Roy Goode
has chosen to hide."

01:57.450 --> 01:58.827
Spinsters?

01:59.494 --> 02:02.455
"I fear and pray for these wretched women

02:02.539 --> 02:03.998
that they are either long gone

02:04.082 --> 02:07.127
or properly defended
for the day soon at hand

02:07.210 --> 02:09.963
when Frank Griffin
and his men ride into town

02:10.046 --> 02:14.175
and make good on his promise to punish
any community that harbors his son."

02:14.259 --> 02:15.343
That's enough.

02:16.094 --> 02:17.637
[Sadie] I-I don't understand.

02:17.720 --> 02:19.222
Who's he talking about?

02:19.305 --> 02:20.974
What desperate young man?

02:24.352 --> 02:26.729
[instrumental theme music plays]

03:23.453 --> 03:25.121
[in Paiute]

03:35.882 --> 03:37.884
[horses trotting in distance]

04:10.416 --> 04:11.417
[Whitey] We, uh...

04:12.293 --> 04:13.878
We come for Roy Goode.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.296
He's gone.

04:15.380 --> 04:16.422
[Logan] Yeah?

04:16.923 --> 04:18.758
Well, I'm gonna have a look around.

04:18.841 --> 04:19.676
[rifle cocking]

04:21.594 --> 04:24.847
Mister, the only way you're getting off
that horse is if I shoot you off.

04:24.931 --> 04:26.557
[chuckles]

04:27.892 --> 04:29.269
You know what, darling?

04:29.352 --> 04:32.438
-I believe you would.
-So then you knew who he really was?

04:33.314 --> 04:36.651
-Not until he turned himself in to Bill.
-[Charlotte] But even after...

04:36.734 --> 04:37.819
you still kept him.

04:38.528 --> 04:41.072
-Kept him?
-You put us in a bad way, Alice.

04:41.155 --> 04:43.574
Sooner or later, Frank Griffin's
gonna find out he was here.

04:43.658 --> 04:44.659
If he hasn't already.

04:45.535 --> 04:46.786
I don't understand.

04:46.869 --> 04:49.414
Mr. Grigg says that Roy Goode's
like a son to Griffin.

04:49.831 --> 04:52.125
Whatever betrayal he feels,
it's downright biblical.

04:52.208 --> 04:54.627
-But if Roy's gone--
-Griffin's made it plain.

04:55.670 --> 04:58.548
He's gonna kill anyone
that Roy Goode loves or cares about.

04:59.465 --> 05:02.760
He's already murdered everyone in Creede,
and then he burned the town to the ground.

05:02.844 --> 05:04.262
If he knows we've been hiding him--

05:04.345 --> 05:06.723
That's why he rode off,
to keep Frank away from here.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.599
He must have told Bill
where Griffin was at.

05:08.683 --> 05:10.310
Got to be why he went off looking for him.

05:11.811 --> 05:13.604
Bill's gone looking for Frank Griffin?

05:14.814 --> 05:17.358
I thought the damn fool
was trying to prove himself to you.

05:19.485 --> 05:22.905
I don't believe that Bill McNue is off
looking for anybody. That man's a coward.

05:22.989 --> 05:24.907
He's going blind, you dumb quiff.

05:30.496 --> 05:32.415
That's why he don't go
shooting off his guns.

05:35.668 --> 05:39.255
Well, we've got to start figuring out
how we're gonna defend ourselves.

05:39.338 --> 05:41.007
Y'all got nothing to worry about.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.718
We made a promise. We aim to keep it.

05:44.218 --> 05:45.928
Not gonna let anything happen
to you folks.

05:46.012 --> 05:49.182
Really? The five of you
are gonna fight Frank Griffin?

05:49.265 --> 05:52.060
We're gonna ride right now to San Marcos,
send for more men.

05:52.143 --> 05:54.437
And if Griffin comes
before these men arrive?

05:54.812 --> 05:56.898
We'll do whatever we can, ma'am.
Charlotte.

05:56.981 --> 05:58.191
Come on. [clicks tongue]

06:07.408 --> 06:09.285
Well, you know I ain't one
to run from no fight.

06:09.368 --> 06:10.912
Nobody's gonna fight anybody.

06:12.371 --> 06:16.084
Tomorrow, first thing, we ride out
of town, hide up in the hills somewhere.

06:16.167 --> 06:17.001
All of us?

06:17.085 --> 06:19.295
[Mary-Agnes]
Maybe if Griffin rides through town...

06:19.921 --> 06:21.672
sees that it's already dead,

06:21.756 --> 06:22.799
he'll keep on going.

06:27.136 --> 06:28.805
I suggest you come with us.

06:29.680 --> 06:30.807
I can't go anywhere.

06:31.599 --> 06:33.851
My boy ran off
and I need to go look for him.

06:34.560 --> 06:35.978
If you'll all excuse me...

[horse whinnies]

07:38.916 --> 07:39.750
[grunts]

07:57.477 --> 08:01.522
Damn Fletcher witch probably got
the Paiutes to steal her horses back.

08:01.606 --> 08:03.149
No, that's not possible.

08:03.232 --> 08:05.526
-It was Frank Griffin.
-Don't be an imbecile.

08:05.943 --> 08:08.029
Why would he steal our horses and leave?

08:08.112 --> 08:10.406
It was Valentine's boys stole the horses.

08:11.282 --> 08:13.534
-Pure and simple.
-Why would they do that?

08:13.618 --> 08:14.785
He made a deal with us.

08:15.161 --> 08:18.164
Which is only good if there's
a town of people left to deal with.

08:19.123 --> 08:22.168
Well, we can't all ride anywhere,
not with only half a dozen mounts,

08:22.251 --> 08:24.337
we can't walk anywhere quick enough...

08:25.296 --> 08:26.422
so we're stuck here.

08:27.423 --> 08:29.342
How many rifles you got over at the jail?

08:29.884 --> 08:31.219
We got about three.

08:31.302 --> 08:33.262
Bill McNue took one of those.

08:33.888 --> 08:34.889
All right.

08:36.182 --> 08:37.266
All of you, get on home,

08:37.350 --> 08:41.229
get your hands on any weapons your
husbands had, bring them to the jailhouse.

08:44.232 --> 08:46.234
What are you looking at her for? Go on!

08:46.317 --> 08:47.944
[murmuring]

08:59.163 --> 09:00.790
[Mary-Agnes] Where you been?

09:01.123 --> 09:03.167
Well, I had a paper to put out.

09:04.168 --> 09:06.546
-Did I miss anything?
-Oh, you're just in time.

09:07.129 --> 09:08.881
But I expect you already knew that.

09:10.132 --> 09:13.553
I wrote a lovely piece
about the ladies of La Belle.

09:18.849 --> 09:20.601
Now you're crying out of both eyes.

09:24.146 --> 09:25.147
Hey, now!

09:26.274 --> 09:27.275
Get the...

09:39.662 --> 09:40.663
[sighs]

10:16.991 --> 10:18.659
[in Paiute]

10:26.709 --> 10:27.752
He's got a map.

10:28.669 --> 10:30.504
Takes him all the way to California.

10:41.223 --> 10:43.184
[footsteps]

10:46.937 --> 10:49.023
It ain't the folks in La Belle
I'm worried about.

10:49.607 --> 10:51.859
It's the folks near La Belle
that give me pause.

10:53.277 --> 10:54.612
You ever hear of Blackdom?

10:55.321 --> 10:57.031
That little speck there is a town?

10:57.615 --> 10:58.741
[Gatz] More like a place.

10:58.824 --> 10:59.659
[Frank grunts]

11:00.159 --> 11:01.619
Why does it catch your eye?

11:03.329 --> 11:06.499
About ten, 12 years ago,
you recall, we were down in Texas.

11:06.582 --> 11:07.416
[Frank grunts]

11:07.500 --> 11:09.293
We get chased by them slave soldiers,

11:09.377 --> 11:11.629
a whole regiment of blackies
in Ranger uniforms.

11:11.712 --> 11:15.049
They was something.
Them boys ran us all over the territory.

11:15.132 --> 11:16.217
[sniffs]

11:16.300 --> 11:18.135
They ran us  out  of the territory.

11:21.305 --> 11:22.431
That was them, huh?

11:23.641 --> 11:26.352
I fed and watered there
on my way back down from Taos.

11:27.144 --> 11:29.063
-Oh, they're farmers now...
-Mm.

11:29.146 --> 11:31.565
...but they all gunned up
like it's still the war.

11:31.649 --> 11:34.026
I would be, too, if I was them.

11:36.070 --> 11:38.906
But I wonder, why would they get
in the middle of a shooting...

11:39.657 --> 11:41.409
that's got nothing to do with them?

11:42.410 --> 11:43.536
Couldn't say.

11:44.912 --> 11:46.997
But they might still be worth an eyeball.

12:25.077 --> 12:27.371
Boy, you cannot be this ignorant.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.081
Mr. Hobbs...

12:30.541 --> 12:33.002
I've been told that by so many folks
for so long now,

12:33.085 --> 12:34.336
I've got to believe it's true.

12:35.379 --> 12:36.589
But here I am.

12:37.131 --> 12:38.507
Well, Louise ain't about.

12:39.341 --> 12:42.511
And even if she was,
I wouldn't let you within ten feet of her.

12:43.262 --> 12:44.680
[Whitey] That's just fine...

12:45.139 --> 12:48.350
seeing as it's you and the other fellas
I came to see.

12:51.312 --> 12:53.189
[Mary-Agnes]
You're lucky they didn't shoot you.

12:53.731 --> 12:55.524
[Whitey]
I thought for a minute they might.

12:56.901 --> 12:58.527
But you think they'll back us?

13:00.029 --> 13:01.238
They're thinking on it.

13:03.115 --> 13:05.284
And they was all soldiers.
I mean, they can't just...

13:05.784 --> 13:08.245
-They can't just watch us get slaughtered.
-Why not?

13:09.121 --> 13:10.372
I would, I was them.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.546
Not everyone's gonna be able to fight.

13:20.090 --> 13:22.551
And even if they could,
we ain't got enough guns.

13:23.469 --> 13:26.222
What we do got ain't enough
to take them out in the open.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.726
Which means we're gonna have
to find a way to contain the fight.

13:30.809 --> 13:31.894
Contain it how?

13:35.481 --> 13:37.775
We can try and keep most of it
off the streets.

13:37.858 --> 13:39.109
[places gun on table]

13:39.610 --> 13:43.822
Get them off their horses and into
someplace where we got the advantage.

13:45.950 --> 13:48.327
Have to be someplace
they couldn't burn us out.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.170
Say someplace made of iron and brick.

14:22.778 --> 14:24.196
[panting]

14:25.155 --> 14:26.156
[gasps]

14:26.240 --> 14:27.533
[panting]

14:32.079 --> 14:34.081
[panting]

14:35.291 --> 14:37.001
Go ahead, betray me!

14:37.084 --> 14:38.669
-Any of you got the guts?
-Frank.

14:39.587 --> 14:40.754
[Frank]  I can shoot you dead.

14:41.922 --> 14:43.507
It's OK. It's just us.

14:44.008 --> 14:44.842
Roy?

14:45.634 --> 14:47.386
[young Roy]  That's right, it's Roy.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.306
[panting]

14:51.765 --> 14:52.600
It's OK.

14:53.517 --> 14:54.685
[grunts]

14:54.768 --> 14:55.769
[young Roy]  It's OK.

14:55.853 --> 14:56.979
[hollow thud]

14:57.563 --> 14:59.231
[scrabbling]

15:00.274 --> 15:01.483
[grunts]

16:00.709 --> 16:02.127
[can rattles]

16:53.846 --> 16:55.264
[mutters] Oh, God.

17:04.523 --> 17:05.733
[rustling]

17:05.816 --> 17:06.817
[horse nickers]

17:07.985 --> 17:09.445
How y'all doing this evening?

17:16.910 --> 17:17.995
I know you, mister?

17:18.078 --> 17:19.079
We met.

17:20.414 --> 17:21.623
Fellas.

17:21.707 --> 17:24.710
We ain't much for people
sneaking up on us in the dark.

17:25.544 --> 17:27.129
I'm just admiring your stock.

17:30.507 --> 17:31.717
You like them, do you?

17:31.800 --> 17:32.801
I do.

17:33.927 --> 17:36.346
Just as much as the first time
I saw them in La Belle.

17:38.599 --> 17:40.142
How'd you fellas end up with them?

17:41.643 --> 17:43.145
The ladies sold them to us.

17:43.729 --> 17:44.897
Now, I wonder...

17:46.565 --> 17:48.484
why'd they do a thing like that,

17:48.567 --> 17:51.195
seeing as how bad they wanted them
in the first place?

17:53.822 --> 17:55.365
I do know you.

17:56.700 --> 17:57.785
Boys...

17:58.994 --> 18:02.122
we got us a real celebrity in our midst.

18:02.956 --> 18:04.083
A right luminary.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.710
A big name. Big name.

18:08.295 --> 18:10.798
Why don't you come and sit with us,
Mr. Roy Goode?

18:11.715 --> 18:12.925
Share our fire.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.344
Have a drink or two.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.554
I was never much for...

18:18.055 --> 18:20.390
spirits or... company.

18:21.517 --> 18:23.977
That's disappointing, but I understand.

18:25.437 --> 18:27.064
Well, Mr. Goode,

18:27.147 --> 18:28.565
it's all the same to you...

18:29.775 --> 18:31.443
you had best keep on moving.

18:31.527 --> 18:32.361
Go on.

18:32.444 --> 18:34.029
I'm gonna do just that.

18:35.697 --> 18:37.950
But first,
I'm gonna cavvy up these animals...

18:38.742 --> 18:40.410
and take them back to La Belle.

18:40.494 --> 18:42.329
[all laugh]

18:42.412 --> 18:43.413
[chuckles]

18:45.082 --> 18:47.126
I'm gonna take your horse, too, friend.

18:48.669 --> 18:50.838
On account of you ain't fit to ride one.

18:52.589 --> 18:53.590
Mister...

18:56.635 --> 18:58.053
I don't think you savvy.

18:59.513 --> 19:02.349
In fact, you're a second away
from getting dealt out of the game.

19:06.645 --> 19:09.106
-You've got nothing to say to that?
-If you're gonna do it...

19:10.524 --> 19:12.025
[cries out] Shit!

19:13.819 --> 19:14.903
[Roy] Like I said...

19:16.113 --> 19:17.531
[spits]

19:17.614 --> 19:18.657
...you ain't fit.

19:19.408 --> 19:20.826
[McNue] Tell me, Mr. Goode,

19:20.909 --> 19:24.454
how are you planning on driving
those horses all the way back to La Belle?

19:25.622 --> 19:27.291
Oh, don't you look at me, boys.

19:27.541 --> 19:28.584
I ain't help.

19:29.293 --> 19:31.670
So you just keep yourselves
nice and still.

19:33.213 --> 19:34.631
They're already still.

19:34.715 --> 19:35.716
Are they?

19:36.216 --> 19:38.886
-How long you been sitting there?
-Long enough.

19:39.595 --> 19:42.681
Now, Mr. Goode and I need to get moving...

19:43.515 --> 19:47.186
so we ask that you boys keep an eye
on this herd for us until we get back.

19:47.352 --> 19:48.353
Y'all hear me?

19:50.772 --> 19:52.608
[McNue mutters]
Horses are gonna have to wait.

19:53.275 --> 19:54.693
[louder] Now, I mean it.

19:54.776 --> 19:56.153
Y'all do as I say.

19:57.529 --> 19:58.947
-[gunshot]
-[man cries out]

19:59.698 --> 20:02.034
[groans] What the hell
did you do that for?

20:02.868 --> 20:05.078
Oh, just because I'm so damn mean.

20:05.162 --> 20:06.246
[grunts]

20:06.330 --> 20:07.956
[Roy] Now, y'all know who I am.

20:08.498 --> 20:11.251
So you all know I'll find you
wherever you go, and I'll kill you.

20:12.127 --> 20:15.714
Just ask these two men rolling around
in the dirt if I mean what I say.

20:16.006 --> 20:19.218
Now, I expect to find this herd fed...

20:20.177 --> 20:21.178
watered...

20:21.929 --> 20:24.640
groomed, hell, all pretty-looking,
when I get back.

20:26.516 --> 20:27.935
Is that all right with you, fellas?

20:28.602 --> 20:30.354
-Yes, Mr. Goode.
-Y-Yes, sir.

20:30.979 --> 20:31.980
Good.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.155
[sighs]

20:42.658 --> 20:43.659
Come on.

20:48.163 --> 20:50.082
[woman]  I've never even heard of this man.

20:50.457 --> 20:53.585
I feel like we've chased him some,
once upon a time.

20:54.544 --> 20:56.588
I say we owe them folks nothing.

20:56.672 --> 20:57.714
Less than nothing.

20:58.215 --> 21:01.426
But how you gonna feel, you ride through
there after they all been massacred?

21:02.511 --> 21:05.806
Not half as bad as I'll feel
if y'all got massacred with them.

21:06.556 --> 21:09.226
Well, if the boy's right,
we're talking about 30 men,

21:09.309 --> 21:11.937
half of them probably drunk
or poorly trained.

21:12.020 --> 21:14.606
We've held off lots more
with a lot fewer than that.

21:16.233 --> 21:17.234
I figure...

21:18.694 --> 21:21.196
in the morning, the two of us,

21:21.280 --> 21:23.657
along with Josiah and his pa,

21:23.740 --> 21:27.244
and Mr. Samuels and his two boys,
and the Walkers, if they're up for it,

21:27.327 --> 21:28.787
we all ride out to La Belle

21:28.870 --> 21:31.623
to see if there's any fortifications
we can help them with.

21:31.999 --> 21:34.668
You don't even know
if this boy is telling the truth.

21:34.751 --> 21:37.129
-Whitey don't lie.
-That you know of.

21:38.422 --> 21:40.257
Well, it took guts to come out here.

21:41.341 --> 21:42.843
I'll give the boy that much.

21:45.262 --> 21:46.596
[knocking at door]

21:49.933 --> 21:51.852
Evening, sir. Folks.

21:52.686 --> 21:55.731
[chuckles] Oh, my.
I see I've interrupted your supper.

21:55.814 --> 21:57.816
Forgive me, uh, but my sons...

21:59.151 --> 22:01.820
My sons and I were wondering
if we might water our horses

22:01.903 --> 22:04.448
and purchase a few supplies from you all.

22:10.412 --> 22:12.289
Please, come in.

22:13.290 --> 22:14.291
Thank you.

22:18.503 --> 22:19.504
Are you hungry?

22:19.588 --> 22:22.466
Oh, we don't want to bother you, ma'am.
Just some water for the horses.

22:22.549 --> 22:25.510
Maybe some jerky or hardtack
if you've got any for purchase.

22:25.594 --> 22:26.928
Then we'll be on our way.

22:27.763 --> 22:29.848
Please, sit down.

22:45.655 --> 22:47.407
Keep an eye on them other houses.

22:57.584 --> 22:59.044
[Frank] This looks mighty good.

22:59.586 --> 23:01.046
Been a while since we...

23:02.506 --> 23:04.007
sat at a proper table.

23:10.013 --> 23:12.682
If you don't mind,
we like to say grace before our meals.

23:25.320 --> 23:26.404
Dear Lord,

23:26.488 --> 23:29.199
thank you for the food and fine company...

23:30.033 --> 23:32.953
and the door that was opened
by these generous people.

23:33.620 --> 23:34.704
In God's name.

23:35.247 --> 23:36.373
Amen.

23:36.456 --> 23:37.541
[Devlins] Amen.

23:48.635 --> 23:52.139
Do you folks know, by chance, how far
we might be from the town of La Belle?

23:53.014 --> 23:54.558
About an hour's ride or so.

23:55.058 --> 23:55.892
Hm.

23:57.853 --> 23:59.104
Are you a preacher?

23:59.604 --> 24:00.605
I am.

24:08.655 --> 24:11.741
I expect we've all in this room
done our share of soldiering.

24:18.498 --> 24:20.375
Are the rest of your men outside?

24:24.296 --> 24:25.755
As I recall...

24:28.008 --> 24:29.551
you ran with quite a few.

24:38.810 --> 24:41.062
And is that a pistol I feel right now...

24:42.564 --> 24:44.065
pointed at me under the table?

24:48.069 --> 24:49.654
And these two boys of yours...

24:50.739 --> 24:52.616
they've got, what from I can tell...

24:53.617 --> 24:55.285
four more pistols between them...

24:56.703 --> 24:57.871
under their coats.

25:00.207 --> 25:01.208
Correct?

25:05.128 --> 25:08.131
You yourself, sir,
I imagine are well-armed.

25:10.759 --> 25:11.927
As are you.

25:13.803 --> 25:14.804
And you.

25:17.015 --> 25:21.645
So it would appear we're sitting
in a room full of men with pistols.

25:25.023 --> 25:26.483
It would appear so.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.573
I ain't got no quarrel with you folks.

25:35.533 --> 25:37.035
My business is in La Belle.

25:37.744 --> 25:40.997
Long as y'all just keep to yourselves,
you'll all be just fine.

25:41.081 --> 25:42.999
So we keep being told.

25:46.294 --> 25:47.712
Where did them kids go?

25:49.673 --> 25:52.092
[chuckles]

25:53.301 --> 25:56.846
They didn't call that railroad
"underground" for nothing.

25:56.930 --> 25:58.515
[faint creaking]

26:00.725 --> 26:01.726
[hatch opening]

26:04.562 --> 26:05.730
[woman screams]

26:09.067 --> 26:10.860
[screaming]

26:25.250 --> 26:26.251
[whimpers] Don't.

26:26.334 --> 26:27.544
[yells]

26:29.879 --> 26:31.506
Enough!

26:35.135 --> 26:36.303
[splutters]

26:39.180 --> 26:40.348
Enough.

26:41.766 --> 26:43.768
[groaning]

26:53.403 --> 26:54.821
[groaning continues]

27:00.577 --> 27:02.579
[wheezing]

27:05.957 --> 27:07.375
Have you no gun, sir?

27:08.293 --> 27:09.919
[gurgles]

27:21.723 --> 27:22.724
[Frank sighs]

27:23.850 --> 27:25.852
[panting]

27:34.235 --> 27:35.570
Goddamn it, sir.

27:40.867 --> 27:44.037
I had no quarrel with you.

27:47.248 --> 27:48.666
[gurgling continues]

27:53.380 --> 27:55.382
[gunfire]

27:57.133 --> 27:58.134
[yelling]

27:59.511 --> 28:00.720
Hey, kids!

28:00.804 --> 28:02.222
[panting]

28:05.058 --> 28:07.727
Shh! Shh! Oh, no. No. Shh!

28:11.231 --> 28:12.232
OK, let's go.

28:12.315 --> 28:14.317
[screaming in distance]

28:18.947 --> 28:20.657
[horse whinnies]

28:31.501 --> 28:33.670
[Roy]  I didn't intend on coming back.

28:35.964 --> 28:39.759
I was heading up to California
when I come upon a huge trail of horses.

28:39.843 --> 28:43.471
Got my curiosity, and that's when
I come upon Logan and his bunch.

28:44.305 --> 28:45.306
California?

28:46.766 --> 28:48.935
To tell you the truth, I had me a feeling.

28:49.811 --> 28:51.396
I knew Frank was coming back.

28:53.314 --> 28:55.650
Sure it wasn't another kind of feeling
brought you back?

28:56.901 --> 28:58.403
A lot of ways to California.

29:00.405 --> 29:02.782
-Are you talking about Alice?
-I'm just talking.

29:05.285 --> 29:07.120
She ain't mine to have, Sheriff.

29:08.371 --> 29:09.789
[horse whinnies in distance]

29:13.460 --> 29:14.627
[Roy] Huh.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.758
-You see him?
-The Indian gentleman?

29:20.925 --> 29:24.763
Jesus. I was beginning to think
I was seeing things that weren't there.

29:25.263 --> 29:29.309
Oh, no, he's there, all right.
Just he ain't exactly alive no more.

29:32.812 --> 29:34.522
I lived with him
and his people for a time.

29:34.606 --> 29:37.525
A few months back,
he and I tried to cross the San Juan...

29:38.443 --> 29:40.069
and it turns out he can't swim.

29:41.446 --> 29:42.864
I thought for sure he died.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.327
Are you telling me that's a ghost?

29:57.337 --> 29:58.505
And the dog?

29:59.798 --> 30:01.174
The dog went first.

30:01.257 --> 30:03.092
[horse whinnies in distance]

30:15.188 --> 30:17.232
Anywhere with a clear shot of the street.

30:21.569 --> 30:23.613
Anywhere with a clear shot of the street.

30:26.616 --> 30:27.951
[picking up gun]

30:29.369 --> 30:30.537
Head into the parlor.

30:36.876 --> 30:38.586
Why don't you go into the dining room?

30:47.136 --> 30:48.471
Hide in the dining room.

30:51.808 --> 30:53.476
Anywhere with a clear shot of the street.

31:03.862 --> 31:05.822
Anywhere with a clear shot of the street.

31:29.929 --> 31:31.764
You put yourself any place you want.

31:34.100 --> 31:35.101
Hey.

31:37.520 --> 31:39.522
What happened to that detective fella?

31:47.447 --> 31:49.449
Anywhere with a clear shot of the street.

31:53.036 --> 31:55.121
Anywhere with a clear shot of the street.

31:59.834 --> 32:01.544
[Mary-Agnes] Put yourself in the parlor.

32:05.757 --> 32:07.800
Anywhere with a clear shot of the street.

32:22.273 --> 32:23.358
They're in Blackdom.

32:24.525 --> 32:26.861
We've been riding around in circles,
hiding all night,

32:26.945 --> 32:28.237
so as not to lead them here.

32:29.030 --> 32:31.574
If they're out there,
they already know where we are.

32:33.409 --> 32:36.579
-Put them kids with the others.
-I ain't no more of a kid than he is.

32:36.663 --> 32:38.957
I'm gonna stay here
and fight with the rest of you.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.416
They killed all my family.

32:40.875 --> 32:43.503
I'm gonna kill each and every one of them
before this day's over.

32:52.011 --> 32:53.179
I see why you like her.

33:04.148 --> 33:05.149
Truckee?

33:49.402 --> 33:50.403
Whoa.

34:26.481 --> 34:28.483
[laughter and chattering]

34:47.794 --> 34:49.170
You open it like this.

34:52.090 --> 34:53.424
Load it like so.

34:54.759 --> 34:56.385
[horse whinnies]

34:58.638 --> 34:59.639
Excuse me.

35:02.767 --> 35:04.143
Why are you all still here?

35:04.685 --> 35:06.562
Valentine's boys stole our horses.

35:08.272 --> 35:09.398
You find your boy?

35:12.193 --> 35:15.071
I haven't seen him,
but then I've been preoccupied some.

35:15.446 --> 35:16.781
[gunshot]

35:16.864 --> 35:17.907
I'm sorry.

35:25.832 --> 35:26.666
Alice?

35:28.459 --> 35:30.711
Your boy's probably safer wherever he is.

35:32.505 --> 35:35.716
And we could use someone who can handle
a rifle without blowing their head off.

35:57.405 --> 35:59.407
[wind howling]

36:01.242 --> 36:03.077

[hooves pounding]

37:48.724 --> 37:50.726
[horse whinnies]

38:03.239 --> 38:06.242
Ain't nothing but pure-ass luck
gonna save us now.

38:16.669 --> 38:18.421
[panting] "The calm...

38:19.797 --> 38:22.216
before the storm."

38:54.957 --> 38:56.959
[horses galloping]

38:59.337 --> 39:00.338
"Roughly...

"Roughly 100...

[horses trotting]

39:41.879 --> 39:43.089
[guns clatter]

40:02.900 --> 40:04.276
He ain't in here!

40:42.773 --> 40:43.983
Where is everybody?

40:46.444 --> 40:47.278
Up there.

40:56.287 --> 40:57.455
Hello, ladies!

41:03.043 --> 41:04.420
You goddamn bitch!

41:05.171 --> 41:06.589

Would you let her know for me?

I found Ed Logan and his boys tied naked
to an old oak not too far from town.
