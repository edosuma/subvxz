00:05.506 --> 00:08.926
Once when she was a girl,
a very little girl,

00:11.345 --> 00:13.430
Dana was in the woods.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.350
It was autumn.

00:16.642 --> 00:20.270
She had always been a tom boy,
unlike her sister, Melissa.

00:23.315 --> 00:25.943
For her birthday, Dana's brothers
had given her a BB gun...

00:25.984 --> 00:28.612
and were showing her
how to use it.

00:32.198 --> 00:35.369
The father had told them
only to shoot at cans.

00:36.745 --> 00:40.123
But in a patch of grass,
Bill Jr. found a garter snake.

00:44.586 --> 00:46.922
And the boys
began shooting.

00:48.423 --> 00:50.968
Wanting to fit in
with her brothers,

00:51.009 --> 00:53.303
Dana also shot
at the snake.

00:54.012 --> 00:56.974
It squirmed wildly,
desperately fighting for life,

00:57.015 --> 00:59.643
but as the boys
continued to shoot,

01:00.727 --> 01:02.896
the snake began to bleed.

01:04.480 --> 01:07.150
When she realized
what she had done,

01:09.069 --> 01:11.989
Dana began to cry
with irrevocable guilt.

01:13.866 --> 01:16.702
Through her tears
she was saying that...

01:17.411 --> 01:20.122
something was missing
from the snake.

01:21.331 --> 01:24.585
She had taken something
that was not hers to take.

01:25.919 --> 01:29.882
And although deathly afraid of snakes,
Dana held the animals if...

01:29.923 --> 01:32.634
sheer human will
could keep it alive.

01:35.220 --> 01:37.890
The snake,
its blood on her hands, died.

01:37.931 --> 01:41.059
There was nothing she could do
to bring it back.

01:43.812 --> 01:46.857
It's too soon, Mrs. Scully.
We can't give up.

01:52.696 --> 01:54.781
That day in the woods,

01:55.699 --> 01:57.826
I felt for my daughter.

02:00.037 --> 02:01.955
But at this moment,

02:03.749 --> 02:06.001
I know how
my daughter felt.

<font color="#00FF00">X-Files</font> Season 2
Episode 08 - One Breath

03:31.879 --> 03:34.006
We should stop.

04:00.532 --> 04:03.118
Sir. Sir,
you can't go in there!

04:09.958 --> 04:12.711
Well,
what would you recommend?

04:23.263 --> 04:26.308
- Who brought her here?
How did she get here?
- Sir, will you please...

04:26.350 --> 04:31.104
- How did she get here?
- Ms. Scully was in this condition
when I arrived for the evening.

04:31.146 --> 04:33.899
- If you step outside,
perhaps Dr. Daly may...
- Is that Daly?

04:33.941 --> 04:36.610
Are you Dr. Daly? What the hell
is going on? How did she get here?

04:36.652 --> 04:40.030
- Would you settle down?
- Was it paramedics? F.B.I.? Military?

04:40.072 --> 04:43.075
- I can't answer that.
I was just assigned to her.
- Answer me right now!

04:43.116 --> 04:45.077
- What? You're telling me
she just appeared?
- Sir...

04:45.118 --> 04:47.538
- Who did this to her?
I want to see her admission forms!
- Sir!

04:47.579 --> 04:50.624
Who did this to her? And I want
to see what tests have been done!

04:50.666 --> 04:55.212
Listen, if you are with them,
if you're hiding anything,
I swear I will do anything!

04:55.254 --> 04:58.715
Whatever it takes,
I'll find out what they did to her!

05:05.597 --> 05:08.642
Presently we have Dana listed
in critical condition. Comatose.

05:08.684 --> 05:11.937
There is complete unawareness
of self or environment.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.897
There is no evidence
of language comprehension.

05:13.939 --> 05:17.025
No evidence of voluntary
responses to external stimuli.

05:17.067 --> 05:19.778
My apologies, but, uh,
no one here...

05:21.029 --> 05:24.074
can determine how Dana arrived
at the hospital,

05:24.116 --> 05:27.202
administered or how she was attended to
in such a critical condition.

05:27.244 --> 05:28.453
Um,

05:29.830 --> 05:33.375
because of the absence of Dana's
recent medical history,

05:33.417 --> 05:35.460
I'm at a loss
for prognosis.

05:35.502 --> 05:38.422
I can't determine, with certainty,
how long she's been in this state.

05:38.463 --> 05:41.300
You haven't told us
why she's like this.

05:41.925 --> 05:44.469
We just don't know,
Mrs. Scully.

05:45.137 --> 05:48.599
There are no indications of a cute
injuries, traumatic or non-traumatic.

05:48.640 --> 05:51.810
I can't find any signs of
degenerative or metabolic disorders.

05:51.852 --> 05:54.563
We have conducted
every test possible.

05:54.646 --> 05:57.149
I'd like her examined
for trace evidence.

05:57.191 --> 06:00.652
Uh, she's been bathed and cleaned
since her admittance.

06:00.819 --> 06:04.907
Also, there is, uh, a situation
which I don't know if you're aware of.

06:05.324 --> 06:09.119
The F.B.I. has notified us
of the terms of Dana's living will.

06:10.078 --> 06:12.581
What is it?
What did she say?

06:13.040 --> 06:15.125
Well, Dana is a doctor.

06:15.375 --> 06:18.712
Her criteria for terminating
life support is quite specific.

06:18.754 --> 06:22.424
She states that, um, if her
Glascow Outcome Scale lists her...

06:23.425 --> 06:26.428
She doesn't want to live
in this condition.

06:27.888 --> 06:30.641
You've signed the will
as her witness.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.871
I've been told
not to call you Fox.

06:52.913 --> 06:55.165
- By who?
- Dana. Just now.

06:59.378 --> 07:01.755
Dana talked to you
just now?

07:01.797 --> 07:04.758
If she talked,
the E.E.G. would have moved.

07:07.553 --> 07:09.388
Her soul is here.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.642
Hi, Mom.

07:15.310 --> 07:17.896
I'm glad you could come,
Melissa.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.190
You're Scully's sister?

07:27.406 --> 07:29.575
Dana's choosing whether...

07:30.158 --> 07:32.578
whether to remain
or move on.

07:41.587 --> 07:43.463
You can feel her.

07:45.257 --> 07:46.592
Here.

08:18.123 --> 08:19.917
She's not here.

08:20.751 --> 08:22.336
Your anger,

08:22.961 --> 08:26.632
your fear's blocking any
positive emotion she needs to feel.

08:33.138 --> 08:36.475
I need to do more than just
wave my hands in the air.

09:39.580 --> 09:41.915
Male, nonsmoker.

09:43.333 --> 09:45.627
May I help you?

09:48.589 --> 09:50.549
Dana Scully, please.

09:51.633 --> 09:53.135
Frohike?

09:55.179 --> 09:58.932
Mr. Fenley
to radiology. Mr. Fenley to radiology.

10:11.987 --> 10:14.281
Hey, Mulder.
This is weird.

10:18.076 --> 10:21.872
- Good work sneakin' out these charts.
- Tucked 'em in my pants.

10:21.914 --> 10:24.458
There's plenty of room
down there.

10:24.625 --> 10:28.462
You look down, Mulder.
Tell ya what. You're welcome
to come over Saturday night.

10:28.504 --> 10:32.174
We're hoppin' on the Internet to nitpick
the scientific inaccuracies of Earth 2.

10:32.216 --> 10:34.176
I'm doin' my laundry.

10:34.218 --> 10:36.428
The chart shows abnormal
protein chains in the blood.

10:36.470 --> 10:39.890
The amino acid sequence is in a
combination that I've never seen before.

10:39.932 --> 10:43.060
I downloaded Scully's medical data
to the newest lone gunman.

10:43.101 --> 10:45.395
He goes by the name
"The Thinker".

10:45.437 --> 10:48.524
- This guy's a hacking genius.

10:53.111 --> 10:56.490
- What?
- The Thinker reports
the protein chains...

10:56.532 --> 10:59.201
are the by-products
of branched DNA.

10:59.243 --> 11:02.955
- Branched DNA?
- The cutting edge
of genetic engineering.

11:03.121 --> 11:05.666
Uh, the biological equivalent
of a silicon microchip.

11:05.707 --> 11:07.918
This is way beyond
cutting edge.

11:07.960 --> 11:10.671
This is technology
50 years down the line.

11:10.712 --> 11:13.757
- What's it used for?
- Could be a tracking system.

11:13.799 --> 11:16.176
The developmental stages
of a biological marker.

11:16.218 --> 11:18.178
You mean a high-tech
identity card?

11:18.220 --> 11:22.307
Or something as insidious as grafting
a human to something... inhuman.

11:22.933 --> 11:25.936
Good theories, gentlemen,
but all for naught.

11:25.978 --> 11:29.064
This branch DNA is inactive.
It's waste product.

11:29.106 --> 11:31.608
Whoever was experimenting
on Scully is finished.

11:31.650 --> 11:34.736
Now it's nothing more
than a biological poison.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.114
Will she live?

11:41.994 --> 11:44.872
Um, her immune system
has been decimated,

11:46.915 --> 11:49.084
and, uh, I doubt even...

11:50.127 --> 11:53.463
a healthy human body
has the ability to fight this.

11:53.755 --> 11:56.425
Mulder,
there's nothing you can do.

12:04.433 --> 12:06.810
Dana? Dana, honey?

12:07.186 --> 12:10.189
I know you can hear me.
This is Nurse Owens.

12:10.647 --> 12:13.400
I'm here to take care
of you, sweet heart.

12:13.442 --> 12:16.361
Watch over you,
help you find the way home.

12:18.906 --> 12:21.783
I know you're far away
from home tonight...

12:21.825 --> 12:24.494
and that where you are
is peaceful.

12:24.786 --> 12:27.289
It'd be nice to stay,
but Dana,

12:28.790 --> 12:31.668
you must leave here
only when it's time.

12:36.006 --> 12:38.675
I'll be here
when you need me, dear.

12:48.268 --> 12:51.188
Excuse me, sir.
I have to take some blood.

13:12.876 --> 13:16.380
- Code blue! Crash cart!
- Crash cart coming in!

13:17.256 --> 13:19.424
Let's get an airway in!

13:21.885 --> 13:24.137
B.P., 80 over 60. Dropping.

13:24.179 --> 13:26.431
Allright.
Let's shock her. Give me the paddles.

13:26.473 --> 13:29.726
- Two hundred joules. Clear?
What do we got?
- Clear.

13:29.768 --> 13:32.563
- Got a catheterin.
- Dropping 80 over...

13:33.313 --> 13:36.024
- Let's go again. 260. Clear?
- Clear.

13:47.077 --> 13:48.412
Hey!

14:34.833 --> 14:37.336
I didn't expect you here
till after visiting hours.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.338
- There was a man.
He took Scully's blood. He...
- Forget him!

14:39.379 --> 14:43.258
- Get that gun out of my face!
- This high-capacity compact
Sig-Sauer 40-caliber weapon...

14:43.300 --> 14:45.385
is pointed at your head
to stress my insistence...

14:45.427 --> 14:48.764
that your search for who put
your partner on that respirator
desist immediately!

14:48.805 --> 14:52.017
You ignore my call for help
and then you expect me to do
what you say? You go to hell!

14:52.059 --> 14:54.603
You got him killed!
You got her killed.

14:54.645 --> 14:56.980
That's not going
to happen to me.

14:57.022 --> 14:59.066
You're my tool.
You understand?

14:59.107 --> 15:01.193
I come to you
when I need you.

15:01.235 --> 15:03.904
Right now you're heading in a direction
that can lead them right here.

15:03.946 --> 15:05.906
What the hell
are you talking about?

15:05.948 --> 15:07.991
You're not supposed to know.
That's the point.

15:08.033 --> 15:11.411
I owe her more than just
sitting around doing nothing.

15:11.495 --> 15:15.541
She was a good solider, Mulder,
but there is nothing you can do
to bring her back.

15:15.582 --> 15:18.502
- She's not dead.
- Listen to you. Listen.

15:21.088 --> 15:23.465
You're a damn
school boy, Mulder.

15:23.507 --> 15:25.801
You have no idea,
no idea!

15:25.926 --> 15:28.303
Okay, then tell me.
Tell me!

15:33.767 --> 15:35.602
I used to be you.

15:36.186 --> 15:39.481
I was where you are now,
but you're not me, Mulder.

15:41.400 --> 15:43.402
I don't think
you have the heart.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.904
Walk away.
Grieve for Scully...

15:46.989 --> 15:49.157
and then never look back.

15:49.825 --> 15:52.995
You will be able to live
with yourself, Mulder,

15:53.620 --> 15:55.497
on the day you die.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.387
Federal agent!

16:56.850 --> 17:00.312
Federal agent. You know I'm armed.
Don't turn around.

17:00.479 --> 17:03.273
Put your gun very slowly
on the ground.

17:06.859 --> 17:10.405
Put your hands behind your head.
Interlock your fingers.

17:10.739 --> 17:14.242
Turn right towards the machine
and put your head on it.

17:26.128 --> 17:27.631
Face me.

17:29.842 --> 17:31.635
Who wants this?

17:33.136 --> 17:34.847
Who wants it?

17:36.557 --> 17:39.017
All right. Let's go.
This way.

18:04.501 --> 18:06.086
Stay there.

18:07.713 --> 18:09.089
Wait!

18:12.384 --> 18:15.846
You want to see what it takes
to find the truth, Agent Mulder?

18:15.888 --> 18:18.473
You want to know
the things I know?

18:27.107 --> 18:29.067
I'll attend to this.

18:38.118 --> 18:40.495
Discontinuing the respirator
does not necessarily mean...

18:40.537 --> 18:43.040
pulling the plug
and ending her life.

18:43.081 --> 18:45.584
Karen Ann Quinlan lived
for nine years...

18:45.626 --> 18:48.212
after cessation
of mechanical ventilation.

18:48.253 --> 18:52.841
I do believe, however,
that this is not the case
with your daughter, Mrs. Scully.

18:53.091 --> 18:55.677
My guess is that she's been in
this state since her disappearance,

18:55.719 --> 18:57.846
and she will not improve.

18:59.223 --> 19:03.018
- Is she below the criteria
established in her will?
- Yeah.

19:03.810 --> 19:07.523
It's possible branched DNA can
be treated with designer antibiotics.

19:07.564 --> 19:11.401
Agent Mulder, I don't know where you've
developed this bizarre diagnosis,

19:11.443 --> 19:13.403
but I do believe you're in
no position to continue here.

19:13.445 --> 19:17.366
You've never provided an answer as to
why she's here or what's wrong with her.

19:17.407 --> 19:20.410
- We need to study her.
- She's not a piece of evidence.

19:20.452 --> 19:23.205
She's here because of
unnatural circumstances.

19:23.247 --> 19:25.999
She's dying.
That's perfectly natural.

19:27.459 --> 19:31.547
We hide people in these rooms because
we don't want to look at death.

19:31.630 --> 19:34.800
We have machines prolong a life
that should end.

19:36.635 --> 19:40.597
That's a much more
unnatural circumstance
than any cause of her death.

19:40.639 --> 19:43.141
That is very
politically correct.

19:43.976 --> 19:45.853
That's very human.

19:49.189 --> 19:50.816
I love her.

19:52.067 --> 19:53.944
And this is right.

20:00.075 --> 20:02.327
Dana has made our decision.

20:04.997 --> 20:06.331
Fox?

20:09.209 --> 20:12.379
You and Dana had a friendship
built on respect.

20:16.258 --> 20:18.260
Now in the last year,

20:19.303 --> 20:21.388
I have lost my husband,

20:22.973 --> 20:26.226
and God knows, I don't want
to lose my baby girl.

20:27.102 --> 20:30.022
But like you,
I have always respected her.

20:35.444 --> 20:38.155
Fox, this is a moment
for the family,

20:40.449 --> 20:42.993
but you can join us,
if you want.

21:42.177 --> 21:44.346
Read it.
It's all there.

21:45.514 --> 21:49.685
If you're having trouble sitting
on Mulder, Assistant Director Skinner,

21:50.185 --> 21:53.313
- I'm sure you know we'd have no trouble.
- Uh-uh.

22:20.841 --> 22:23.552
- Yeah, come in.

22:29.725 --> 22:31.226
Sit down.

22:33.687 --> 22:37.524
I called you up here because
of rumors about an incident
at the hospital last night.

22:37.566 --> 22:41.111
Is this about the tooth that
was found in the cafeteria Jell-O?

22:41.153 --> 22:45.449
- The rumor has it that you were
involved in the laundry room?
- No, sir.

22:45.824 --> 22:48.911
- A man was executed, Agent Mulder.
- I was with Scully.

22:48.952 --> 22:52.206
- Traces of her blood
were found at the scene.
- May I see the police report?

22:52.247 --> 22:56.084
There is no police report of
this incident, and there is no body.

22:57.044 --> 23:00.547
Since I am unfamiliar with
any such incidents, sir, no.
How would I know that?

23:00.589 --> 23:02.925
- Knock it off!
- How does it feel?

23:02.966 --> 23:06.887
Constant denial of everything,
questions answered with a question.

23:07.346 --> 23:09.348
I want to know
what happened, damn it!

23:09.389 --> 23:11.600
Him.
That's what happened.

23:12.392 --> 23:15.562
Cancer Man. He's responsible
for what happened to Scully!

23:15.604 --> 23:18.899
- How do you know that?
- It's a rumor. Who is he?

23:19.233 --> 23:21.568
- It's not your...
- Oh, you can have it all!

23:21.610 --> 23:24.154
You can have my badge. You can have
the X-Files. Just tell me where he is.

23:24.196 --> 23:28.367
And then what? He sleeps with the
fishes? We're not the Mafia, Mulder.

23:30.077 --> 23:32.579
I know it's easy to forget, but
we work for the Department of Justice.

23:32.621 --> 23:34.498
That's what I want.

23:34.831 --> 23:37.376
Agent Scully was
a fine officer.

23:38.752 --> 23:41.797
More than that, I liked her.
I respected her.

23:41.922 --> 23:45.968
We all know the field we play in
and we all know what can happen
in the course of a game.

23:46.009 --> 23:50.722
If you were unprepared
for all the potentials,
then you shouldn't step on the field.

23:56.103 --> 23:59.147
What if I... I knew
the potential consequences,

23:59.398 --> 24:01.692
but I...
I never told her?

24:04.611 --> 24:08.657
Then you're as much to blame
for her condition as... the Cancer Man.

24:53.160 --> 24:55.454
Hello, Starbuck.
It's Ahab.

25:00.626 --> 25:02.753
People would say to me,

25:04.630 --> 25:07.591
"Life is short.
Kids, they grow up fast.

25:09.051 --> 25:11.595
Before you know it,
it's over".

25:12.095 --> 25:13.931
I never listened.

25:16.099 --> 25:18.727
To me, life went
at a proper pace.

25:21.396 --> 25:23.607
There were many rewards...

25:25.901 --> 25:28.070
until the moment that...

25:29.321 --> 25:31.657
I knew,
I understood that...

25:33.492 --> 25:35.827
I would never
see you again.

25:37.746 --> 25:39.498
My little girl.

25:41.917 --> 25:45.629
Then my life felt as if it had been
the length of one breath,

25:48.465 --> 25:50.175
one heartbeat.

25:52.928 --> 25:55.639
I never knew how much
I loved my daughter...

25:55.681 --> 25:58.016
until I could
never tell her.

26:01.061 --> 26:04.022
At that moment,
I would have traded every medal,

26:04.064 --> 26:06.024
every commendation,
every promotion...

26:06.066 --> 26:08.610
for just one more second
with you.

26:15.117 --> 26:17.703
We'll be together again,
Starbuck.

26:19.705 --> 26:21.665
But not now.
Soon.

26:37.598 --> 26:40.017
- Dana?

26:41.602 --> 26:44.313
I know death is
at arms reach tonight.

26:46.148 --> 26:48.650
But Dana,
your time is not over.

26:55.324 --> 26:57.409
You know, Fox...
Sorry.

26:58.660 --> 27:00.078
Mulder.

27:01.622 --> 27:05.209
You could spend the rest of your life
finding every person who's responsible,

27:05.250 --> 27:08.045
and it's still not
gonna bring her back.

27:08.670 --> 27:12.341
Whoever did this to her
has an equal horror coming to them.

27:14.468 --> 27:17.262
- Including myself?
- Pardon me.

27:17.638 --> 27:19.806
Sir, do you have change
for the cigarette machine?

27:19.848 --> 27:21.725
No. Sorry, I don't.

27:24.770 --> 27:27.022
What do you mean,
yourself?

27:27.564 --> 27:30.275
There's a pack already here.
Morleys.

27:30.776 --> 27:32.444
Not my brand.

28:05.310 --> 28:08.438
Cigarette break? How about smoke?

28:16.196 --> 28:17.739
Sit down!

28:18.657 --> 28:21.243
- How'd you find me?
- Shut up!

28:21.827 --> 28:25.038
Tonight I ask the questions, and you're
gonna answer me, you son of a bitch!

28:25.080 --> 28:28.876
Don't try and threaten me, Mulder.
I've watched presidents die.

28:33.547 --> 28:35.090
Why her?

28:37.759 --> 28:39.720
Why her and not me?

28:41.889 --> 28:43.473
Answer me!

28:44.558 --> 28:46.810
I like you.
I like her too.

28:47.436 --> 28:50.063
That's why she was
returned to you.

28:53.150 --> 28:55.152
You should be
the one to die.

28:55.194 --> 28:57.029
Why?
Look at me.

28:59.948 --> 29:01.909
No wife.
No family.

29:02.534 --> 29:04.161
Some power.

29:04.745 --> 29:08.373
I'm in the game because
I believe what I'm doing is right.

29:09.458 --> 29:12.503
Right? Who are you
to decide what's right?

29:14.046 --> 29:15.714
Who are you?

29:18.842 --> 29:22.054
If people were to know
of the things that I know,

29:24.014 --> 29:26.141
it would all fall apart.

29:28.227 --> 29:32.731
I told Skinner you shot
the man in the hospital,
but I didn't really believe it.

29:32.773 --> 29:35.526
And here you are
with a gun to my head.

29:36.443 --> 29:40.239
I have more respect for you, Mulder.
You're becoming a player.

29:43.951 --> 29:47.371
You can kill me now,
but you'll never know the truth.

29:57.214 --> 29:59.216
And that's why I'll win.

29:59.258 --> 30:01.844
Don't worry.
This'll be our secret.

30:04.763 --> 30:07.182
We wouldn't
want others to...

30:08.100 --> 30:09.810
start rumors.

31:13.665 --> 31:17.211
When I started out, this room
was where they kept the copier.

31:17.252 --> 31:20.380
At least back then
it wasn't just wasted space.

31:27.971 --> 31:29.848
It's unacceptable.

31:32.643 --> 31:35.187
Look, I know you feel
responsible for Agent Scully,

31:35.229 --> 31:38.524
but I will not accept resignation
and defeat as self-punishment.

31:38.565 --> 31:42.653
All the forensics, the field
investigations, the eye witness accounts,

31:43.779 --> 31:45.822
to still know nothing.

31:46.198 --> 31:48.575
To lose myself...
and Scully.

31:51.703 --> 31:53.872
I hate what I've become.

32:04.633 --> 32:06.718
When I was 18,
I, uh,

32:08.220 --> 32:10.097
I went to Vietnam.

32:10.681 --> 32:15.477
I wasn't drafted, Mulder.
I enlisted in the Marine Corps
the day of my 18th birthday.

32:16.395 --> 32:18.480
I did it on
a blind faith.

32:20.899 --> 32:23.819
I did it because I believed
that it was the right thing to do.

32:23.861 --> 32:26.280
I don't know.
Maybe I still do.

32:26.864 --> 32:29.116
Three months into my tour,

32:29.700 --> 32:33.996
a ten-year-old North Vietnamese boy
walked into camp covered with grenades.

32:34.913 --> 32:36.456
And I, uh,

32:38.959 --> 32:42.337
I blew his head off...
from a distance of ten yards.

32:43.422 --> 32:45.257
I lost my faith.

32:45.424 --> 32:48.677
Not in my country or in myself,
but in everything.

32:51.096 --> 32:54.057
There was just no point
to anything anymore.

32:57.686 --> 33:00.230
One night on patrol,
we were, uh,

33:01.148 --> 33:02.566
caught.

33:04.109 --> 33:06.486
And everyone...
everyone fell.

33:07.529 --> 33:09.031
Everyone.

33:14.077 --> 33:16.371
I looked down
at my body...

33:18.457 --> 33:20.417
from outside of it.

33:20.459 --> 33:22.961
I didn't recognize it
at first.

33:23.337 --> 33:26.798
I watched the V.C. strip my uniform,
take my weapon.

33:27.382 --> 33:29.259
And I remained...

33:30.344 --> 33:32.387
in this thick jungle.

33:33.931 --> 33:35.933
Peaceful.
Unafraid.

33:39.811 --> 33:41.939
Watching my dead friends.

33:44.483 --> 33:46.276
Watching myself.

33:46.485 --> 33:50.614
In the morning, the corps men arrived
and put me in a body bag until...

33:51.406 --> 33:54.326
I guess they found a pulse.
I don't know.

33:54.451 --> 33:57.454
I woke in a Saigon hospital
two weeks later.

34:02.042 --> 34:05.504
I'm afraid to look any further
beyond that experience.

34:07.172 --> 34:09.091
You?
You are not.

34:12.678 --> 34:15.222
Your resignation
is unacceptable.

34:21.937 --> 34:23.230
You.

34:27.400 --> 34:29.987
You gave me
Cancer Man's location.

34:32.030 --> 34:34.324
You put your life
in danger.

34:35.659 --> 34:38.411
Agent Mulder,
every life, every day...

34:39.371 --> 34:41.039
is in danger.

34:41.665 --> 34:43.500
That's just life.

35:00.976 --> 35:02.853
Your plane ticket.

35:04.438 --> 35:08.525
- But we barely know each other.
- I can't tell you why she was taken.

35:08.775 --> 35:12.237
It's too close to me.
I'm giving you the men who took her.

35:12.279 --> 35:15.324
- How?
- They believe you'll be out of town.

35:15.866 --> 35:17.868
They believe you have
information about Scully...

35:17.910 --> 35:20.746
being kept in your desk
in your apartment.

35:20.787 --> 35:23.957
At 8:17 tonight,
they'll search your apartment.

35:24.666 --> 35:26.668
They will be armed.
You will be waiting.

35:26.710 --> 35:30.297
- Waiting?
- To defend yourself
with terminal intensity.

35:34.384 --> 35:36.386
It's the only way, Mulder.

35:36.428 --> 35:39.097
The law will not punish
these people.

35:43.936 --> 35:47.397
After tonight, we cannot
make contact for several weeks.

36:16.218 --> 36:17.636
Mulder.

36:23.934 --> 36:25.310
Sorry.

36:26.019 --> 36:29.565
I came by. You weren't answering.
Your machine wasn't on.

36:29.815 --> 36:31.567
Can I come in?

36:33.652 --> 36:35.362
For a second?

36:47.207 --> 36:50.919
- Why is it so dark in here?
- 'Cause the lights aren't on.

36:51.587 --> 36:52.963
Okay.

36:55.174 --> 36:57.593
I just came
from the hospital.

36:57.634 --> 37:00.137
Dr. Daly says...
she's weakening.

37:01.722 --> 37:05.809
It could be any time, so I figured
you'd want to come down and see her.

37:06.018 --> 37:09.271
- Well, I can't.
- Well, I'd think that you would.

37:10.063 --> 37:12.774
Yeah, I would.
I can't. Not right now.

37:16.570 --> 37:18.030
Listen.

37:19.698 --> 37:23.368
I don't have to be psychic to see
that you're in a very dark place,

37:23.410 --> 37:26.038
much darker
than where my sister is.

37:26.079 --> 37:29.833
Willingly walking deeper into darkness
cannot help her at all.

37:31.168 --> 37:35.005
- Only the light will...
- Oh, enough with
the harmonic convergence crap.

37:35.047 --> 37:37.049
You're not saying
anything to me.

37:37.090 --> 37:41.303
Why don't you just drop your cynicism
and your paranoia and your defeat?

37:41.720 --> 37:45.557
You know, just because it's positive
and good doesn't make it silly or trite.

37:45.599 --> 37:48.602
Why... Why is it so much easier
for you to run around...

37:48.644 --> 37:51.271
trying to get even than just
expressing to her how you feel?

37:51.313 --> 37:54.149
I expect more from you.
Dana expects more.

37:56.777 --> 38:00.280
Even if it doesn't bring her back,
at least she'll know,

38:00.906 --> 38:02.699
and so will you.

38:20.467 --> 38:22.344
I.C.U.

38:24.179 --> 38:26.306
Yes, that was two units.

38:28.725 --> 38:30.269
Thank you.

38:47.828 --> 38:49.913
I feel, Scully, that...

38:52.833 --> 38:55.502
You believe
you're not ready to go.

38:58.797 --> 39:01.175
And you've always had
the strength of your beliefs.

39:01.216 --> 39:03.677
I don't know
if my being here...

39:07.681 --> 39:09.892
will help
bring you back.

39:15.564 --> 39:17.232
But I'm here.

40:56.081 --> 40:58.792
I'm afraid in this case...

41:00.127 --> 41:02.713
Let me check the chart.

41:14.808 --> 41:16.727
Call Dr. Daly. Now.

41:41.043 --> 41:44.421
Hello, this is
Fox Mulder. Leave a message please.

41:44.463 --> 41:45.923
I'm here.

41:56.225 --> 41:58.727
- Hello, Fox.
- Not Fox. Mulder.

42:05.192 --> 42:06.944
How ya feelin'?

42:07.986 --> 42:11.448
I really don't remember anything...
after Duane Barry.

42:13.283 --> 42:15.494
Doesn't...
Doesn't matter.

42:17.829 --> 42:19.998
I brought you
a present.

42:21.250 --> 42:23.252
The Super Stars
of the Super Bowls.

42:23.293 --> 42:25.838
I knew there was
a reason to live.

42:29.383 --> 42:31.927
Now you want
to get some rest. I...

42:32.344 --> 42:35.597
I just came by to see
how you're doing and say hi.

42:40.102 --> 42:41.562
Mulder?

42:44.356 --> 42:47.025
I had the strength
of your beliefs.

42:59.121 --> 43:01.456
I was holding this
for you.

43:48.378 --> 43:50.506
Can I see Nurse Owens?

43:51.590 --> 43:53.800
I've got something
I'd like her to have.

43:53.842 --> 43:55.385
Nurse who?

43:59.139 --> 44:00.516
Owens.

44:01.058 --> 44:03.810
Short with straight,
light brown hair.

44:04.353 --> 44:07.439
She watched over me in intensive care,
and I'd like to thank her.

44:07.481 --> 44:10.192
Dana, I've worked here
for ten years,

44:11.151 --> 44:14.196
and there's no Nurse Owens
at this hospital.
