<i>Air and naval
forces of the United States</i>

00:09.072 --> 00:11.939
<i>launched a series of strikes</i>
<i>against terrorist facilities...</i>

00:11.941 --> 00:13.941
<i>Pan Am flight 103 crashed
into the town of Lockerbie.</i>

00:13.943 --> 00:15.309
<i>He has sanctioned
acts of terror</i>

00:15.311 --> 00:18.079
<i>in Africa, Europe and</i>
<i>the Middle East.</i>

00:18.081 --> 00:20.748
<i>This will not stand, this
aggression against, uh, Kuwait.</i>

00:20.750 --> 00:22.383
<i>This relentless
pursuit of terror.</i>

00:22.385 --> 00:24.085
<i>We will make no distinction...</i>

00:24.087 --> 00:25.653
<i>The USS</i> Cole <i>was attacked</i>

00:25.655 --> 00:26.821
<i>while refueling in</i>
<i>the port of Aden.</i>

00:26.823 --> 00:28.789
This was an act of terrorism.

00:28.791 --> 00:31.225
It was a despicable
and cowardly act.

00:31.227 --> 00:33.661
<i>The next samba</i>
<i>we're going to swing for you</i>

00:33.663 --> 00:34.795
is one of the good old
favorites.

00:34.797 --> 00:37.431
...until something stops him.

00:37.433 --> 00:40.267
<i>It was right</i>
<i>in front of my eyes,</i>

00:40.269 --> 00:41.936
<i>and I never saw it coming.</i>

00:41.938 --> 00:44.972
<i>That plane crashed</i>
<i>into the World Trade Center.</i>

00:44.974 --> 00:47.475
<i>Thousands of people running.</i>

00:47.477 --> 00:51.445
We must and we will remain
vigilant at home and abroad.

00:57.319 --> 00:59.520
<i>You're the smartest</i>
<i>and the dumbest fucking person</i>

00:59.522 --> 01:01.689
<i>I've ever known.</i>

01:01.691 --> 01:03.324
<i>I'm not the
one who got it wrong.</i>

01:03.326 --> 01:05.426
<i>I'm the only one</i>
<i>who got it right.</i>

01:09.297 --> 01:11.198
<i>Take 'em.</i>

01:11.200 --> 01:12.933
<i>Take 'em all.</i>

01:19.900 --> 01:23.005
Homeland - 3x08
"A Red Wheel Barrow"

01:24.012 --> 01:26.147
<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

01:26.149 --> 01:28.516
I'm an associate
at Bennett, Parr and Hamilton.

01:28.518 --> 01:30.585
One of our partners would
like to meet with you.

01:30.587 --> 01:32.820
Miss Mathison, Leland Bennett.

01:32.822 --> 01:34.255
What does your client want?

01:34.257 --> 01:35.990
To pick your brain
from time to time.

01:35.992 --> 01:38.226
Put you on retainer as it were.

01:39.362 --> 01:41.229
No sound.

01:41.231 --> 01:43.064
Take it off.

01:45.267 --> 01:47.602
Carrie Mathison.

01:47.604 --> 01:49.904
It's time we talk
about Nasser Hejazi.

01:49.906 --> 01:53.708
Whose name you used to embezzle
more than $45 million.

01:53.710 --> 01:55.943
You are now an enemy
of your own state.

01:55.945 --> 01:57.412
I got plans for you.

01:57.414 --> 01:58.579
What plans?

01:58.581 --> 02:00.381
I'm gonna play you
back into Iran.

02:00.383 --> 02:01.849
From now on you work for us.

02:01.851 --> 02:03.050
For me.

02:03.052 --> 02:05.586
I've recruited
a high-level Iranian asset.

02:05.588 --> 02:06.888
Majid Javadi.

02:06.890 --> 02:09.723
The man who financed
the bombing of the CIA?

02:09.726 --> 02:11.726
We talked about this.

02:11.728 --> 02:14.929
The need to wean you
of your cold war bullshit.

02:14.931 --> 02:17.231
This is a once
in a lifetime operation

02:17.233 --> 02:19.901
that can transform everything.

02:19.903 --> 02:21.736
The entire Middle East.

02:21.738 --> 02:24.272
You sound like
you're fucking high.

02:24.274 --> 02:26.741
I need to know something
before you leave.

02:26.743 --> 02:28.876
I need to know...

02:28.878 --> 02:30.912
who's responsible for the bomb?

02:30.914 --> 02:32.313
<i>You know what he asked me?</i>

02:32.315 --> 02:34.248
Who moved the bomb?

02:34.250 --> 02:35.917
If it was Brody.

02:35.919 --> 02:37.585
Now, why would he ask me that?

02:37.587 --> 02:40.221
That implies that
there's a difference

02:40.223 --> 02:41.923
of opinion on that subject.

02:41.925 --> 02:43.157
You should know that the man

02:43.159 --> 02:45.326
who built the bomb
and moved the SUV,

02:45.328 --> 02:47.762
he didn't die
in the explosion like they say.

02:47.764 --> 02:49.630
As far as I know, he's
still in this country.

02:49.632 --> 02:50.631
Where?

02:50.633 --> 02:51.632
I don't know.

02:51.634 --> 02:52.500
Who does?

02:52.502 --> 02:54.335
The man that brought
us together.

02:54.337 --> 02:56.737
Your lawyer? Bennett?

03:08.238 --> 03:09.718
Fuck!

03:15.457 --> 03:17.425
Ah!

03:35.277 --> 03:38.012
What happened to you?

03:38.014 --> 03:39.613
I started to get worried.

03:39.615 --> 03:41.415
I'm out of practice.

03:43.018 --> 03:45.786
Well...

03:45.788 --> 03:47.655
this looks delicious, Saul.

03:47.657 --> 03:50.090
Thank you.

03:50.092 --> 03:51.826
Can I pour you a cup of tea?

03:51.828 --> 03:53.627
Please.

03:53.629 --> 03:54.695
Where did you get these from?

03:54.697 --> 03:56.096
Aren't these the mugs

03:56.098 --> 03:58.165
we brought back
from the Philippines?

03:58.167 --> 03:59.800
The very last pair.

04:02.805 --> 04:04.638
When this is all over,

04:04.640 --> 04:07.508
I'd like to go back to that
island on the Sulu Sea.

04:07.510 --> 04:10.811
You know, you don't have
to promise anything.

04:10.813 --> 04:13.681
Really. I understand.

04:13.683 --> 04:16.317
No, I don't see why not.

04:16.319 --> 04:17.817
We might actually have fun.

04:17.820 --> 04:20.286
Well, the evidence does
seem to indicate

04:20.289 --> 04:21.654
that that is possible

04:21.656 --> 04:24.091
after all.

04:25.660 --> 04:29.163
Is there any chance

04:29.165 --> 04:33.033
that you could stay home today?

04:38.540 --> 04:42.243
There's nothing I'd rather do.

04:42.245 --> 04:43.844
But?

04:43.846 --> 04:45.512
I got a meeting
with Mike Higgins

04:45.514 --> 04:46.881
this morning at
the White House.

04:46.883 --> 04:48.649
- When?
- 9:30.

04:51.186 --> 04:54.355
Well, that gives us
an hour and a half...

04:54.357 --> 04:56.056
by my count.

04:56.058 --> 04:58.058
Yes, it does.

05:09.304 --> 05:10.671
Okay, here's something.

05:10.673 --> 05:13.474
Dr. Maximillian Aziz,
Jordanian,

05:13.476 --> 05:16.377
was actually in the auditorium
the time the bomb went off.

05:16.379 --> 05:18.079
Ops or Intelligence?

05:18.081 --> 05:20.548
Intelligence--
Office of Transnational Issues.

05:20.550 --> 05:23.184
And what's his connection
to Leland Bennett?

05:23.186 --> 05:25.352
He wrote a lengthy analysis

05:25.354 --> 05:27.054
of the firm's
hip-pocket clients.

05:27.056 --> 05:29.190
Iran, Syria, Azerbaijan.

05:29.192 --> 05:31.358
This was two years ago.

05:31.360 --> 05:33.327
It hardly fits the profile.

05:33.329 --> 05:36.363
Any munitions training?
Experience with explosives?

05:36.365 --> 05:38.265
Uh... no.

05:40.870 --> 05:41.869
All right, add him
to the list anyway.

05:41.871 --> 05:44.538
Yeah, which begs the question--

05:44.540 --> 05:46.040
are we even sure
that the guy who made the bomb

05:46.042 --> 05:48.042
moved Brody's car?

05:48.044 --> 05:49.944
- Depends.
- On what?

05:49.946 --> 05:51.679
On whether or not
you believe Javadi.

05:51.681 --> 05:53.180
- Which you do.
- Which I do.

05:53.182 --> 05:54.882
But it takes
more than an opinion

05:54.884 --> 05:56.050
to put it in front of Saul.

05:56.052 --> 05:57.885
Right.

05:57.887 --> 06:01.188
You know, I can't help but feel
we're spinning our wheels here.

06:01.190 --> 06:03.124
The FBI have been through
these files a hundred times.

06:03.126 --> 06:04.892
Anybody that was
at Langley that day

06:04.894 --> 06:06.227
has been turned inside-out
and upside-down.

06:06.229 --> 06:08.028
Yeah, well, someone
who was at Langley

06:08.030 --> 06:09.130
that day did the bombing.

06:16.204 --> 06:17.705
I still can't believe

06:17.707 --> 06:20.407
all these people are gone.

06:20.409 --> 06:22.376
Yeah.

06:24.746 --> 06:26.046
Where's Fara anyway?

06:26.048 --> 06:28.549
She was supposed
to be here over an hour ago.

07:28.810 --> 07:30.010
- Come on in, Saul.
- Hey, Mike.

07:30.012 --> 07:31.545
Good to see you.

07:34.316 --> 07:36.283
Senator?

07:37.652 --> 07:39.820
Yeah.

07:39.822 --> 07:43.157
The Senator's made
some serious allegations.

07:43.159 --> 07:44.658
Which are?

07:44.660 --> 07:46.861
That you had Majid Javadi
in a safe house,

07:46.863 --> 07:48.162
on American soil

07:48.164 --> 07:50.030
and let him go.

07:50.032 --> 07:51.365
Do you contest that?

07:51.367 --> 07:53.000
Yes and no.

07:53.002 --> 07:54.535
What's the yes?

07:54.537 --> 07:56.203
I'm not aware
of any standing order

07:56.205 --> 07:58.706
to arrest Colonel Javadi.

07:58.708 --> 08:00.507
- Did you have him in custody or not?
- I did.

08:00.509 --> 08:02.676
Aw, Jesus fucking Christ, Saul.

08:02.678 --> 08:04.178
We didn't just "Let him go,"
Mike.

08:04.180 --> 08:05.412
We debriefed him.

08:05.414 --> 08:07.181
Turned him.

08:07.183 --> 08:09.016
Sent him back to Iran.

08:09.018 --> 08:10.517
You turned him?

08:10.519 --> 08:11.852
He's ours.

08:11.854 --> 08:13.254
With no guarantee

08:13.256 --> 08:14.355
that he'll actually cooperate.

08:14.357 --> 08:15.689
- He will.
- How do you know?

08:15.691 --> 08:17.691
Because I know the man.

08:17.693 --> 08:19.193
Because he knows the game.

08:19.195 --> 08:21.095
That is total speculation.

08:21.097 --> 08:22.830
He's right.

08:22.832 --> 08:24.365
We haven't had
a whole lot of success

08:24.367 --> 08:26.367
- in that department lately.
- Well, we have now.

08:26.369 --> 08:27.768
Javadi's the highest
placed CIA asset

08:27.770 --> 08:29.603
in the history of the Agency.

08:29.605 --> 08:32.873
He ordered and financed
the attack on Langley.

08:32.875 --> 08:34.041
All the better if he did.

08:34.043 --> 08:35.174
He's above suspicion.

08:35.177 --> 08:36.543
A high-profile arrest
would've sent

08:36.544 --> 08:38.212
a clear message to the Mullahs.

08:38.214 --> 08:40.381
Back the fuck down.

08:40.383 --> 08:42.082
Instead we have a live source,
keeping us current

08:42.083 --> 08:43.751
on Iran's pursuit
of a nuclear weapon,

08:43.753 --> 08:46.053
on Hezbollah operations
all over the globe.

08:46.055 --> 08:48.255
How come I never saw
a finding on this?

08:48.257 --> 08:49.757
We were responding to events
on the ground.

08:49.759 --> 08:51.392
The call had to be made
in real time.

08:51.394 --> 08:54.428
That is horseshit,
and he knows it.

08:55.897 --> 08:59.233
Mike, I think it's time
you excuse the Senator.

08:59.235 --> 09:01.535
What are you talking about?

09:01.537 --> 09:02.803
I called this meeting to brief

09:02.805 --> 09:04.939
the Chief of Staff on
the second phase of the mission.

09:04.941 --> 09:05.940
- So, go ahead.
- I can't.

09:05.942 --> 09:07.241
- Not with you present.
- Why not?

09:07.243 --> 09:08.575
Because your security clearance

09:08.577 --> 09:10.711
is one level below operational.

09:10.713 --> 09:12.112
You see what I'm dealing with?

09:12.114 --> 09:13.747
The man is out of hand

09:13.749 --> 09:15.249
and out of control.

09:15.251 --> 09:16.417
And in this case, he's correct.

09:16.419 --> 09:17.584
I'm sorry, Senator.

09:17.586 --> 09:20.421
Mike, in nine days,

09:20.423 --> 09:21.822
I'm the next DCI.

09:21.824 --> 09:23.757
And in nine days,
Saul will brief you

09:23.759 --> 09:25.259
on whatever you need to know.

09:25.261 --> 09:26.593
- But not until then.
- Mike...

09:26.595 --> 09:27.861
Senator.

09:29.764 --> 09:31.565
- Mike?
- Senator, please.

09:41.477 --> 09:43.110
Goddamn it, Saul.

09:43.112 --> 09:44.778
I spent the last
month and a half

09:44.780 --> 09:46.613
arranging a marriage
between you two.

09:46.615 --> 09:48.148
I'm out, I know that.

09:48.150 --> 09:49.950
You are now.

09:49.952 --> 09:51.518
You didn't need to be.

09:53.621 --> 09:55.723
Javadi was worth it.

09:57.625 --> 10:01.028
All right, tell me
about this phase two.

10:15.777 --> 10:17.878
Regime change?

10:17.880 --> 10:19.013
Eventually.

10:19.015 --> 10:20.681
We're setting the stage.

10:20.683 --> 10:22.483
How?

10:22.485 --> 10:25.452
First we move Javadi
up the chain of command

10:25.454 --> 10:27.821
into a senior
military position.

10:27.823 --> 10:28.822
How?!

10:28.824 --> 10:30.424
Keep reading.

10:47.842 --> 10:49.910
Sorry I'm late.

10:49.912 --> 10:51.912
Traffic.

10:53.681 --> 10:55.516
I ordered you a macchiato,

10:55.518 --> 10:57.151
but it's probably cold by now.

10:59.320 --> 11:01.288
Thank you.

11:03.858 --> 11:05.325
It's fine.

11:05.327 --> 11:07.261
So I got your text.

11:07.263 --> 11:08.662
Everything okay?

11:08.664 --> 11:10.998
Yes.

11:11.000 --> 11:11.999
No.

11:14.035 --> 11:16.036
It's... Saul.

11:16.038 --> 11:19.373
What about him?

11:19.375 --> 11:21.275
We've made a decision.

11:21.277 --> 11:23.410
Well, I-I've made a decision.

11:23.412 --> 11:26.080
To give the marriage
another chance.

11:26.082 --> 11:29.016
I...

11:29.018 --> 11:31.618
You have to know,
it's not easy for me.

11:33.721 --> 11:37.691
And when, uh, did you
decide all this?

11:37.693 --> 11:39.893
Last night.

11:39.895 --> 11:43.230
Forgive me, but didn't we just
spend yesterday in a suite

11:43.232 --> 11:45.199
at the Ritz Carlton?

11:48.570 --> 11:50.304
What's changed?

11:51.306 --> 11:53.574
I-I just told you.

11:53.576 --> 11:55.409
What, suddenly Saul and you

11:55.411 --> 11:56.610
have decided to reconcile?

11:56.612 --> 11:57.911
It's not suddenly.

11:57.913 --> 12:00.714
We've been talking about it
for the last two months.

12:00.716 --> 12:01.949
You know that.

12:01.951 --> 12:03.450
Well, I was under
the impression

12:03.452 --> 12:04.985
that you had given up on that.

12:04.987 --> 12:06.453
That you both had.

12:06.455 --> 12:08.589
Well, I don't know,
maybe we had.

12:08.591 --> 12:10.557
Then there's something
you're not telling me.

12:12.994 --> 12:16.897
- We've been married 35 years.
- I love you.

12:21.136 --> 12:22.269
Don't say that.

12:22.271 --> 12:23.937
I love making love to you.

12:23.939 --> 12:26.940
- I have to go.
- Mira...

12:26.942 --> 12:28.909
Good-bye.

12:36.284 --> 12:37.951
He signed off?

12:37.953 --> 12:39.620
Well, let's put it this way--

12:39.622 --> 12:41.922
he sees the merits
of the operation.

12:41.924 --> 12:43.524
So he's taking it
to the President?

12:43.526 --> 12:44.625
- Yes.
- Merits?

12:44.627 --> 12:46.994
Saul, it's fucking genius.

12:46.996 --> 12:49.163
If we can pull it off.

12:49.165 --> 12:51.165
- When are you leaving?
- Tomorrow morning.

12:51.167 --> 12:53.033
Does Carrie know you're going?

12:53.035 --> 12:54.801
She can't even suspect it.

12:58.173 --> 12:59.840
Heard you were looking for me.

12:59.842 --> 13:01.675
Yeah, we were just going
over the transcript

13:01.677 --> 13:03.110
of your debrief with Javadi

13:03.112 --> 13:05.145
to see if it supported
what he told Carrie

13:05.147 --> 13:06.647
- on the tarmac yesterday.
- Which was?

13:06.649 --> 13:08.115
That the man who moved the SUV

13:08.117 --> 13:09.650
is still in the United States,

13:09.652 --> 13:11.218
and he's somehow connected
to Leland Bennett's law firm.

13:11.220 --> 13:13.153
- Connected how?
- It's unclear.

13:13.155 --> 13:14.888
We were hoping you could
shed some light.

13:14.890 --> 13:17.324
Javadi didn't mention
the Bennett connection.

13:18.360 --> 13:20.060
Well, what about Brody?

13:20.062 --> 13:21.728
Did he mention Brody?

13:21.730 --> 13:22.829
In what context?

13:22.831 --> 13:26.333
In the context
of being the bomber.

13:26.335 --> 13:28.302
Not in so many words, he didn't.

13:28.304 --> 13:29.736
Well, what did he say?

13:29.738 --> 13:31.838
He said as far as he knows,
Brody didn't move the car.

13:31.840 --> 13:35.042
As far as he knows?

13:35.044 --> 13:36.410
That's not what he told me.

13:36.412 --> 13:39.346
- Okay.
- He told me definitively it wasn't Brody.

13:39.348 --> 13:40.814
What's your point?

13:40.816 --> 13:43.016
Why would he tell us
two different stories?

13:43.018 --> 13:45.352
Is that a question
or an accusation?

13:45.354 --> 13:48.355
Well, I guess I'd like
a straight answer.

13:48.357 --> 13:50.357
And if Javadi even intimated

13:50.359 --> 13:52.859
that Brody didn't move the car,
why not press him on who did?

13:52.861 --> 13:54.528
Well, you're angry
because I didn't share

13:54.530 --> 13:55.696
a conversation with you
about Brody.

13:55.698 --> 13:57.097
An inconclusive one.

13:57.099 --> 13:59.066
No, I'm angry because
you seem entirely indifferent

13:59.068 --> 14:00.701
to catching the actual bomber.

14:00.703 --> 14:02.169
Speak for yourself.
I'm all for it.

14:02.171 --> 14:03.737
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

14:06.874 --> 14:08.609
So... you two...

14:08.611 --> 14:10.877
actually have a plan?

14:10.879 --> 14:14.047
Yeah. Yeah, we want to flush
this guy out into the open.

14:14.049 --> 14:16.550
Mm-hmm. How?

14:16.552 --> 14:19.453
You know Leland Bennett
personally, right?

14:19.455 --> 14:21.922
We've golfed Congressional
a few times together.

14:21.924 --> 14:25.058
And we serve on the board
of the Northam Foundation.

14:25.060 --> 14:28.962
How comfortable would you be
making an approach?

14:30.765 --> 14:32.432
Comfortable enough.

15:05.099 --> 15:06.566
Oh, back already?

15:06.568 --> 15:08.234
Yeah, I'm not feeling well.

15:08.236 --> 15:09.903
You can go.

15:09.905 --> 15:11.304
I'll look after him today.

15:11.306 --> 15:12.405
You sure?

15:12.407 --> 15:14.374
Yeah.
How is he?

15:14.376 --> 15:16.076
Oh, sitting up.

15:16.078 --> 15:17.711
Progress.

15:17.713 --> 15:19.946
Yeah, slowly but surely.

15:19.948 --> 15:21.915
I'll see you tomorrow.

15:21.917 --> 15:22.916
Feel better.

15:22.918 --> 15:24.751
Thanks.

15:24.753 --> 15:28.088
Baba Joon.

15:28.090 --> 15:30.290
I'm staying home today.

15:32.761 --> 15:34.961
Do I need a reason?

15:37.966 --> 15:41.101
I'm not going to lose my job.

15:44.940 --> 15:46.840
Because I'm sure.

15:46.842 --> 15:49.109
Speak English.

15:56.084 --> 15:57.984
English.

15:57.986 --> 16:00.286
I did not come to America

16:00.288 --> 16:03.089
to live in the street
like a dirty Arab.

16:03.091 --> 16:04.424
Baba...

16:04.426 --> 16:05.859
listen to me.

16:05.861 --> 16:07.327
Nothing like that
is going to happen.

16:07.329 --> 16:09.129
No one's going to throw us
out of our home.

16:09.131 --> 16:11.364
Don't worry.

16:11.366 --> 16:13.800
My job's safe.

16:13.802 --> 16:15.669
At the bank?

16:15.671 --> 16:18.304
Yes.

16:18.306 --> 16:21.207
At the investment bank.

16:21.209 --> 16:24.477
If you work at the bank,

16:24.479 --> 16:27.313
why are we not rich?

16:34.055 --> 16:36.523
Richter.
That's a German surname.

16:36.525 --> 16:38.491
My parents were
born in Hamburg.

16:38.493 --> 16:39.959
Do you speak it?

16:39.961 --> 16:41.294
<i>Ja natürlich.</i>

16:41.296 --> 16:43.229
That's useful.

16:43.231 --> 16:47.167
We represent three private
banking houses in Berlin.

16:47.169 --> 16:50.370
Would you, uh, excuse me
for just a moment?

16:50.372 --> 16:51.938
Of course.

16:58.245 --> 17:00.180
You're early.

17:00.182 --> 17:02.515
I'm in the middle of
interviewing a new associate.

17:02.517 --> 17:04.651
It won't take long.

17:04.653 --> 17:06.219
We missed you

17:06.221 --> 17:08.021
at the foundation
meeting last week.

17:08.022 --> 17:09.823
Couldn't get there.
Work.

17:09.825 --> 17:10.990
Ah...

17:10.992 --> 17:12.925
You gotta make time for us.

17:12.928 --> 17:14.594
It's not enough
that I've raised

17:14.596 --> 17:16.596
over a million dollars
this quarter?

17:16.598 --> 17:18.397
You know me.

17:18.400 --> 17:20.032
Never satisfied.

17:20.035 --> 17:23.703
But... that's not
what this is about.

17:23.704 --> 17:25.872
- No?
- No.

17:25.874 --> 17:27.674
Sounds ominous.

17:27.675 --> 17:30.176
I do terror now, by the way.

17:30.178 --> 17:32.378
I'm not sure you knew that.

17:32.380 --> 17:34.114
I don't think I did.

17:34.116 --> 17:37.584
Your firm's name
has come up lately.

17:37.586 --> 17:38.885
More than once.

17:38.887 --> 17:41.387
- In what light?
- That I can't tell you.

17:41.389 --> 17:43.356
Then why tell me at all?

17:43.358 --> 17:46.392
Because tomorrow morning
at exactly 10:00,

17:46.394 --> 17:48.428
I walk into a high level,
top secret meeting

17:48.430 --> 17:51.564
at which you are the agenda.

17:51.566 --> 17:54.701
What do you want?

17:54.703 --> 17:57.570
Cooperate with us.
Come clean.

17:57.572 --> 17:59.272
Get out in front of what's sure

17:59.274 --> 18:01.241
to turn into a...

18:01.243 --> 18:04.711
a bruising investigation.

18:06.081 --> 18:08.414
You know what?

18:08.416 --> 18:12.619
20 years ago, I might've fallen
for that weak shit.

18:12.621 --> 18:14.187
But today...

18:16.724 --> 18:18.424
come after me if you want.

18:18.426 --> 18:20.460
I've got nothing to hide.

18:53.612 --> 18:56.567
_

19:52.186 --> 19:54.320
Who's the candle for?

19:56.223 --> 19:59.559
All the departed.

20:01.729 --> 20:02.829
You Orthodox?

20:09.371 --> 20:13.006
Old boyfriend.

20:13.008 --> 20:15.375
I hear the weddings
go on forever.

20:15.377 --> 20:19.212
Longer than the marriages,
so goes the joke.

20:19.214 --> 20:23.116
Mr. Bennett needs you to look
into something for him.

20:23.118 --> 20:26.119
My arrangement's
with Majid Javadi,

20:26.121 --> 20:27.453
not Leland Bennett.

20:27.455 --> 20:28.454
Correct.

20:28.456 --> 20:30.123
But what Mr. Bennett
heard today

20:30.125 --> 20:32.225
might reverberate onto you.

20:32.227 --> 20:33.426
Onto me?

20:33.428 --> 20:35.361
Do I need
to remind you--

20:35.363 --> 20:37.096
you're a recruited agent
of a foreign government?

20:37.098 --> 20:39.232
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:39.234 --> 20:41.734
I met with Javadi.
Once.

20:41.736 --> 20:44.570
I agreed to consult with him.
I'm nobody's agent.

20:44.572 --> 20:46.906
I doubt the CIA would
appreciate the distinction.

20:46.908 --> 20:48.074
What the hell do you
know about it?

20:48.076 --> 20:50.076
I know the law firm
appears to be

20:50.078 --> 20:52.412
the target of an inquiry
of some kind.

20:52.414 --> 20:55.748
Well, not one
that I'm aware of.

20:55.750 --> 20:58.584
The warning was
delivered personally,

20:58.586 --> 21:01.254
outside of official channels.

21:01.256 --> 21:03.423
By somebody who works
at the Agency?

21:03.425 --> 21:06.793
A longtime acquaintance
of Mr. Bennett, yes.

21:06.795 --> 21:10.263
So what do you want from me?

21:10.265 --> 21:12.332
Confirm the report.

21:12.334 --> 21:14.133
Mr. Bennett
needs to know

21:14.135 --> 21:16.002
what part of the business
is under investigation

21:16.004 --> 21:18.938
and what he can do
to protect himself.

21:20.475 --> 21:22.008
That's not going to be easy.

21:22.010 --> 21:24.310
Not without
setting off alarm bells.

21:24.312 --> 21:26.012
You'll figure something out.

21:26.014 --> 21:27.447
I'll figure something out?

21:27.449 --> 21:29.515
And obviously there's
a clock on this.

21:29.517 --> 21:30.583
Obviously.

21:51.105 --> 21:52.138
Mmm...

22:00.147 --> 22:01.314
Hello?

22:01.316 --> 22:02.648
It's on.

22:02.650 --> 22:04.217
Tell me.

22:04.219 --> 22:05.284
I just met with Franklin.

22:05.286 --> 22:06.486
They're panicking over there.

22:06.488 --> 22:07.687
Well, let them.

22:07.689 --> 22:10.056
Wait 24 hours...

22:10.058 --> 22:13.326
then hit them with the news
we know who the bomber is.

22:13.328 --> 22:15.294
Will do.

22:15.296 --> 22:16.963
Uh, Saul?

22:16.965 --> 22:18.531
Yeah?

22:18.533 --> 22:22.001
I need some personal time
between then and now.

22:22.003 --> 22:23.202
You got it.

22:23.204 --> 22:25.338
- Thanks.
- You all right?

22:25.340 --> 22:27.507
Yeah.

22:27.509 --> 22:30.243
I should've shared that intel
about Brody with you sooner.

22:30.245 --> 22:32.211
I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking.

22:32.213 --> 22:33.746
You've been to hell and back.

22:33.748 --> 22:35.848
I know how important
this is to you.

22:35.850 --> 22:39.085
I owe you.
We all do.

22:39.087 --> 22:41.821
Yeah, well, as long as we get
the real bomber...

22:41.823 --> 22:44.057
We will.

22:56.870 --> 22:57.937
Carrie?

22:57.939 --> 22:59.705
Yeah.
How'd you know?

22:59.707 --> 23:00.873
Tone of your voice.

23:00.875 --> 23:02.708
You don't talk
to anyone else like that.

23:02.710 --> 23:05.278
Huh, I wasn't aware.

23:05.280 --> 23:06.746
You ready to eat?

23:08.749 --> 23:10.550
Should I open a bottle of wine?

23:10.552 --> 23:12.251
That's a great idea.

23:14.621 --> 23:16.222
Listen...

23:16.224 --> 23:17.890
I got to go away for a few days.

23:17.892 --> 23:19.358
You do?

23:19.360 --> 23:21.461
- Yeah.
- When?

23:21.463 --> 23:23.629
Tomorrow.

23:23.631 --> 23:25.064
Saul...

23:25.066 --> 23:26.699
I know.

23:26.701 --> 23:29.402
The timing's not great.

23:29.404 --> 23:32.138
But you said only
a couple of days?

23:32.140 --> 23:34.574
Yeah.
A week, at the most.

23:34.576 --> 23:38.177
A week?

23:41.415 --> 23:43.483
I wouldn't be going...

23:43.485 --> 23:46.385
if I didn't absolutely have to.

23:46.387 --> 23:47.987
You know what,
I could go with you.

23:47.989 --> 23:49.922
- Wouldn't that be great?
- Why not?

23:49.924 --> 23:51.757
It's not that kind of trip.

23:51.759 --> 23:54.127
I wish it were.

24:00.434 --> 24:01.968
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

24:02.971 --> 24:04.403
To us.

24:10.878 --> 24:12.612
You've been nauseous?

24:12.614 --> 24:13.613
Yeah.

24:13.615 --> 24:15.815
Usually that goes away by now.

24:15.817 --> 24:18.518
So I've heard.

24:18.520 --> 24:21.454
I'm getting a real
clear image here.

24:21.456 --> 24:24.424
You want to know if
it's a boy or a girl?

24:27.194 --> 24:29.195
No.

24:38.305 --> 24:39.706
Sorry this is
so last-minute.

24:39.708 --> 24:42.075
No, no, it's great to see you.

24:42.077 --> 24:43.743
This is quite a surprise.

24:43.745 --> 24:45.178
I saw Maggie at the
hospital last week,

24:45.180 --> 24:46.179
she didn't say a thing.

24:46.181 --> 24:48.548
She doesn't know.

24:48.550 --> 24:50.049
Does that have
anything to do with

24:50.051 --> 24:52.051
why you're coming in for
your first prenatal exam

24:52.053 --> 24:54.888
13 weeks in?

24:54.890 --> 24:57.257
I didn't exactly plan this.

24:57.259 --> 24:59.259
But you've known for some time.

25:02.529 --> 25:04.497
What about medications?

25:04.499 --> 25:06.199
What are you currently taking?

25:06.201 --> 25:08.101
Uh, at the moment, nothing.

25:08.103 --> 25:09.202
I see.

25:09.204 --> 25:10.370
Uh...

25:10.372 --> 25:12.605
I was on 1,800 milligrams
of lithium

25:12.607 --> 25:14.407
for about a month there.

25:14.409 --> 25:16.542
Things were a little
out of control.

25:16.544 --> 25:18.544
And, uh, before that,

25:18.546 --> 25:21.047
there was a lot of drinking.

25:21.049 --> 25:24.550
A... lot.

25:24.552 --> 25:26.519
After you knew?

25:28.555 --> 25:31.224
I haven't been
painting a nursery,

25:31.226 --> 25:32.425
just put it that way.

25:32.427 --> 25:35.662
Are you telling me
you wish to terminate?

25:37.131 --> 25:39.132
I just want to know
what the tests say.

25:39.134 --> 25:40.800
If things are okay.

25:40.802 --> 25:42.735
Well...

25:42.737 --> 25:44.904
you're iron deficient.

25:44.906 --> 25:46.072
We can fix that.

25:46.074 --> 25:47.640
But your blood
pressure's very high.

25:49.576 --> 25:51.945
I've been...
really stressed at work.

25:51.947 --> 25:55.248
Well, you really should
be taking it easy.

25:55.250 --> 25:58.084
Yeah, I'll try.

25:58.086 --> 25:59.752
Carrie, we can manage this.

25:59.754 --> 26:01.788
Keep you and the baby healthy.

26:01.790 --> 26:04.223
It's not magic, it's a process.

26:04.225 --> 26:06.459
You want to leave it to
chance, that's up to you.

26:06.461 --> 26:08.261
Otherwise you need
to modify your behavior.

26:08.263 --> 26:11.097
Not in a week or two,
or when it's convenient.

26:11.099 --> 26:13.066
Now.

26:16.603 --> 26:19.272
What I'm doing,
it has to do with the father.

26:19.274 --> 26:21.240
I need to make
some things right.

26:21.242 --> 26:23.977
It matters to a lot of people.

26:23.979 --> 26:26.446
But this is different, Carrie.

26:26.448 --> 26:28.081
You're not on your own anymore.

26:48.202 --> 26:49.702
Fara?

26:49.704 --> 26:50.870
Sherazi?

26:50.872 --> 26:52.839
And you are?

26:52.841 --> 26:53.840
Mitchell Clausen.

26:53.842 --> 26:54.974
From the IG's Office.

26:54.976 --> 26:56.209
IG?

26:56.211 --> 26:57.677
Inspector General.

26:57.679 --> 26:59.479
May I come in?

27:03.818 --> 27:05.785
This way.

27:11.291 --> 27:12.392
May I offer you something?

27:12.394 --> 27:13.659
I'm good.
Um...

27:13.661 --> 27:15.561
you called in sick
two days in a row.

27:15.563 --> 27:17.397
Is something the matter?

27:17.399 --> 27:18.731
Migraines.

27:18.733 --> 27:20.833
Yet you drove
into work yesterday.

27:20.835 --> 27:22.668
Yes.

27:22.670 --> 27:25.004
Where you sat in the parking
lot for over half an hour

27:25.006 --> 27:27.707
before deciding to leave again.

27:27.709 --> 27:30.676
I was hoping the
headache would go away.

27:30.678 --> 27:32.712
Is that why you
then paid a visit

27:32.714 --> 27:35.148
to 1426 Longhill Road,

27:35.150 --> 27:38.851
where the recent
double murder happened?

27:38.853 --> 27:42.755
The Bethesda PD took
down your license number.

27:42.757 --> 27:45.525
Oh.

27:45.527 --> 27:47.860
The Agency had to call in
a lot of favors

27:47.862 --> 27:50.363
to close that investigation.

27:50.365 --> 27:54.367
Your going over there
jeopardized all that.

27:54.369 --> 27:57.870
I wanted to see
where it happened.

27:57.872 --> 28:01.374
Why?

28:01.376 --> 28:03.876
It upset me.
I...

28:03.878 --> 28:05.178
I was upset by it.

28:07.848 --> 28:10.183
Director Berenson has
shown an unusual degree

28:10.185 --> 28:12.685
of confidence in you,
Ms. Sherazi...

28:12.687 --> 28:15.388
Entrusted you with matters
of national importance.

28:15.390 --> 28:17.190
I'm aware of that.

28:17.192 --> 28:19.592
But your current state of mind

28:19.594 --> 28:20.726
makes your loyalty to him

28:20.728 --> 28:23.229
and to the Agency
a very live issue.

28:23.231 --> 28:26.933
Tell the Director not to worry.

28:26.935 --> 28:28.267
I'm fine.

28:28.269 --> 28:30.736
You can tell him yourself.

28:30.738 --> 28:32.705
When you come
into work tomorrow.

28:32.707 --> 28:34.974
Yes.

28:47.087 --> 28:49.055
Director Berenson?

28:53.161 --> 28:55.094
Who is this Director Berenson?

28:55.096 --> 28:58.331
My boss.

28:58.333 --> 28:59.832
But he's no banker, is he?

29:01.668 --> 29:03.569
No.

29:03.571 --> 29:05.438
You went ahead, didn't you?

29:05.440 --> 29:08.441
In spite of everything I said?

29:08.443 --> 29:10.409
Baba, an attack happened.

29:10.411 --> 29:11.410
So what?

29:11.412 --> 29:12.778
It's none of your business.

29:12.780 --> 29:14.347
They needed Farsi speakers

29:14.349 --> 29:16.682
with experience in
international finance.

29:16.684 --> 29:18.151
I had to help.

29:18.153 --> 29:20.186
And when the secret
police find out

29:20.188 --> 29:22.121
who you work for, what then?

29:22.123 --> 29:25.258
We have family still in Tehran!

29:25.260 --> 29:27.827
Your uncle,
his wife and children.

29:27.829 --> 29:31.097
They will be added to the list
of those to be hanged,

29:31.099 --> 29:34.467
or shot!

29:42.309 --> 29:43.943
I'm an American.

29:49.016 --> 29:51.784
Target is still unknown,
but presumed to be the man

29:51.786 --> 29:54.954
who put the bomb in position
in front of the HQ auditorium.

29:54.956 --> 29:56.522
This is Paul Franklin,

29:56.524 --> 29:58.824
our stalking horse.
Carrie?

29:58.826 --> 30:01.160
Later this afternoon,
I'll promote misinformation

30:01.162 --> 30:02.328
to Mr. Franklin
in the hopes that

30:02.330 --> 30:03.496
he'll lead us to the bomber.

30:03.498 --> 30:06.165
Our assumption is
that after the meeting,

30:06.167 --> 30:07.967
he'll reach out
for instructions.

30:07.969 --> 30:09.869
To this man.

30:09.871 --> 30:12.805
Leland Bennett, one of the
senior partners at the firm.

30:12.807 --> 30:15.708
Which is why operation,
from this moment forward,

30:15.710 --> 30:18.211
requires a full complement
of audio and visual surveillance

30:18.213 --> 30:20.012
on both subjects.

30:20.014 --> 30:21.647
I don't have to tell you

30:21.649 --> 30:23.516
what catching
this guy would mean.

30:23.518 --> 30:25.017
In other words, stay small,

30:25.019 --> 30:26.986
stay cool, stay out of sight.

30:26.988 --> 30:28.087
Okay, everybody.

30:28.089 --> 30:29.155
Game time.

31:06.526 --> 31:08.127
You were right.

31:08.129 --> 31:09.762
Tell me.

31:09.764 --> 31:11.097
They've connected
your firm to the guy

31:11.099 --> 31:12.565
who detonated the bomb
at Langley.

31:12.567 --> 31:13.699
That's not possible.

31:13.701 --> 31:14.934
I'm telling you
what I found out.

31:14.936 --> 31:16.235
All right.
Okay.

31:19.940 --> 31:21.407
They're also under
the impression

31:21.409 --> 31:23.743
that he's still here
in the United States.

31:23.745 --> 31:25.711
Is that true?

31:27.414 --> 31:29.081
Answer the question,
or so help me,

31:29.083 --> 31:31.083
I'll get up and you'll
never see me again.

31:31.085 --> 31:32.451
Take it easy, Carrie.
Take a breath.

31:32.453 --> 31:34.553
No, don't patronize me.

31:36.156 --> 31:37.590
Okay.

31:37.592 --> 31:39.425
It's true, he's here.

31:39.427 --> 31:41.394
He's here where?

31:43.597 --> 31:47.300
I'm assuming that means
they haven't located him yet.

31:47.302 --> 31:48.301
No, they haven't.

31:48.303 --> 31:49.902
Then exactly what do they have?

31:49.904 --> 31:52.605
A warrant pending
before a FISA judge,

31:52.607 --> 31:54.774
naming Leland Bennett
a co-conspirator.

31:54.776 --> 31:56.142
Mm-hmm.

31:56.144 --> 31:57.777
How soon before
the warrant's active?

31:57.779 --> 32:00.012
A few days, at least.

32:00.014 --> 32:01.280
They won't find anything.
Bennett's clean.

32:01.282 --> 32:02.448
He works through a cutout.

32:02.450 --> 32:03.916
You.

32:03.918 --> 32:06.952
Just lay low and
let me handle this.

32:06.954 --> 32:08.654
You're the one who's
been handling this,

32:08.656 --> 32:10.756
so excuse me if your assurance
isn't very assuring.

32:37.517 --> 32:39.518
They have a line on our friend.

32:39.520 --> 32:41.020
How'd they get onto him?

32:41.022 --> 32:42.788
- No idea.
- Well, find out.

32:42.790 --> 32:44.123
It's a little late for that,
don't you think?

32:44.125 --> 32:46.192
You sure it wasn't your mistake?

32:46.194 --> 32:48.160
You sure it wasn't yours?

32:48.162 --> 32:50.830
We were asked to provide
material support

32:50.832 --> 32:53.499
to an American citizen
with ties to the Regime.

32:53.501 --> 32:57.002
There was no mention of his
involvement in the bombing.

32:57.004 --> 32:58.504
There was later.

32:58.506 --> 33:00.506
Yes, there was.

33:00.508 --> 33:03.843
Well, we should've
dealt with it then.

33:03.845 --> 33:04.810
Maybe.

33:06.847 --> 33:08.481
Do they know his name?

33:08.483 --> 33:10.049
No.

33:10.051 --> 33:11.717
Then we're still okay.

33:11.719 --> 33:14.520
Do you want
him out of the country?

33:14.522 --> 33:15.521
Yes.

33:15.523 --> 33:17.690
Preferably with a new identity.

33:17.692 --> 33:19.558
How much do I tell him?

33:19.560 --> 33:20.860
I don't care.

33:20.862 --> 33:22.094
Just get him out.

33:46.453 --> 33:47.920
Franklin's sending a text.

33:47.922 --> 33:49.755
Talk to me.

33:49.757 --> 33:51.724
It's an address and time.

33:51.726 --> 33:53.058
Fairview Motel in Lynchburg,

33:53.060 --> 33:54.693
0130.

33:54.695 --> 33:56.228
Can we trace who
he's sending it to?

33:56.230 --> 33:58.564
No, there must be an
anonymizer on the device.

33:58.566 --> 33:59.565
Don't worry, Carrie.

33:59.567 --> 34:01.367
As long as we stick on Franklin,

34:01.369 --> 34:02.535
you'll get your bomber.

34:02.537 --> 34:04.570
He's right.

34:04.572 --> 34:06.238
We'll send a tactical team
to the motel.

34:06.240 --> 34:07.306
They'll arrest the target

34:07.308 --> 34:08.808
as soon as
Franklin clears scene.

35:34.995 --> 35:36.862
DC Department of Transportation

35:36.864 --> 35:38.898
is warning drivers
to prepare for delays

35:38.900 --> 35:42.001
due to street closures downtown
Thursday through Saturday.

35:42.003 --> 35:44.169
Officials say southbound

35:44.171 --> 35:45.905
14th Street Northwest

35:45.907 --> 35:49.408
will be closed between G Street
and Pennsylvania.

36:13.033 --> 36:14.967
Here's something.

36:16.770 --> 36:19.038
It could be him.

36:19.040 --> 36:21.273
Yeah, it is him.
I've got a visual.

36:23.743 --> 36:25.177
Copy that.

36:36.690 --> 36:37.890
What's he doing?

36:37.892 --> 36:39.391
Just sitting there
at the moment.

36:39.393 --> 36:42.061
Bravo, do you have eyes on?

36:42.063 --> 36:45.731
I'm looking down
on the roof of his car.

36:45.733 --> 36:46.732
No one moves

36:46.734 --> 36:48.701
until Franklin leaves site.

36:48.703 --> 36:51.003
Copy that.

36:58.612 --> 37:00.212
He's calling someone.

37:00.214 --> 37:02.548
We got it.

37:08.555 --> 37:09.955
Are you here?

37:09.957 --> 37:11.023
Outside.

37:16.429 --> 37:18.564
Flash your lights.

37:23.803 --> 37:25.604
What room are you in?

37:25.606 --> 37:27.439
First tell me what's happening.

37:27.441 --> 37:30.309
You may have been compromised.

37:30.311 --> 37:32.444
How the hell did that happen?

37:32.446 --> 37:33.612
It happened.

37:33.614 --> 37:35.581
What difference
does it make how?

37:35.583 --> 37:37.249
Because I'm the one
whose life is fucked.

37:37.251 --> 37:39.118
If I hadn't gotten to you first,
you'd spend

37:39.120 --> 37:41.320
the rest of your life living
in a cage.

37:41.322 --> 37:43.756
Try on some gratitude.

37:43.758 --> 37:45.591
You want
your exfil package or not?

37:47.827 --> 37:49.128
2-2-0.

37:49.130 --> 37:50.562
Be right up.

38:10.617 --> 38:12.484
Shit. He's got a weapon.

38:12.486 --> 38:14.620
What?

38:14.622 --> 38:17.489
Now he's silencing it.
Jesus, you seeing this?

38:17.491 --> 38:18.824
He's got a gun!

38:18.826 --> 38:20.492
Bravo, can you confirm?

38:20.494 --> 38:22.961
Negative. My view is obscured.

38:22.963 --> 38:24.329
He's not exfiltrating
the bomber,

38:24.331 --> 38:25.531
he's taking him out.

38:25.533 --> 38:26.565
You don't know that, Carrie.

38:26.567 --> 38:30.002
Why else would
he have a silencer?

38:30.004 --> 38:31.503
She's right, Scott.

38:31.505 --> 38:33.672
I make the weapon.

38:33.674 --> 38:36.341
I'm telling you
Franklin's gonna kill that guy.

38:36.343 --> 38:40.345
Listen to me. We just
heard Bennett telling Franklin

38:40.347 --> 38:42.181
to get the guy
out of the country.

38:42.183 --> 38:43.982
Maybe Bennett changed his mind.

38:43.984 --> 38:47.519
Either way, our priority
is to keep Franklin in play.

38:47.521 --> 38:49.855
So we just let him kill
the bomber?

38:49.857 --> 38:51.557
If necessary, yes.

38:51.559 --> 38:53.992
That wasn't the deal.

38:53.994 --> 38:56.395
The bomber's the only way
to prove that Brody's innocent.

38:56.397 --> 38:59.198
And stopping Franklin now
would blow your cover

38:59.200 --> 39:02.067
and Javadi's back in Tehran.

39:02.069 --> 39:04.536
You get that, right?

39:04.538 --> 39:07.172
Until Franklin is clear,
I want all teams

39:07.174 --> 39:08.440
to stand down.

39:08.442 --> 39:09.508
All teams, acknowledge

39:09.510 --> 39:10.743
standing down.

39:10.745 --> 39:12.244
Bravo here, standing down.

39:12.246 --> 39:14.046
Alpha Team standing down.

39:14.048 --> 39:16.181
Carrie, acknowledge.

39:23.556 --> 39:25.124
Carrie?

39:26.226 --> 39:27.426
Carrie, what the fuck

39:27.428 --> 39:29.728
are you doing?

39:29.730 --> 39:31.096
Carrie, go back to the van!

39:31.098 --> 39:33.065
Saul promised me this guy alive.

39:33.067 --> 39:34.900
Saul's not calling
the shots here.

39:34.902 --> 39:37.536
He promised me, goddamn it.
Get him on the phone!

39:37.538 --> 39:39.404
There's no time.
Turn around!

39:39.406 --> 39:41.273
Carrie, turn around now,

39:41.275 --> 39:42.875
or we will stop you.

39:42.877 --> 39:46.411
This is your last warning.

39:46.413 --> 39:48.147
Listen to the man, Carrie.

39:51.384 --> 39:53.585
Bravo, I am authorizing force.

39:53.587 --> 39:54.820
Take the shot. I repeat.

39:54.822 --> 39:55.988
- Take the shot.
- Let me.

40:01.594 --> 40:03.095
Carrie, this is Quinn.

40:03.097 --> 40:04.096
Break away.

40:04.098 --> 40:05.264
I'm sorry. I can't.

40:05.266 --> 40:06.565
You're fucking us, Carrie.

40:06.567 --> 40:08.901
Months of work. Your work.

40:08.903 --> 40:10.969
I don't care.

40:10.971 --> 40:13.238
Carrie, I will take the shot.

40:14.808 --> 40:16.975
Window's closing,
for Christ's sake!

40:42.101 --> 40:44.136
He's in. Franklin is inside.

40:44.138 --> 40:45.804
Pick her up, for God's sake!

40:45.806 --> 40:46.438
Go! Go!

41:14.367 --> 41:17.035
Move it!

41:17.037 --> 41:19.037
Jesus Christ.

41:22.475 --> 41:23.675
What was the delay?

41:23.677 --> 41:25.177
I stopped her, didn't I?

41:25.179 --> 41:27.145
Go with her.
I'm watching Franklin.

41:38.658 --> 41:40.692
Hospital's on the line.
Tell 'em we got

41:40.694 --> 41:43.328
a gunshot wound
to the upper left bicep,

41:43.330 --> 41:44.730
significant bleeding,
might have clipped an artery.

41:44.732 --> 41:47.032
Hold on. You're gonna be all right.

41:48.035 --> 41:50.836
Goddamn it!

41:50.838 --> 41:54.072
Fuck! Fuck!

41:58.177 --> 41:59.211
- Quinn...
- Yeah?

41:59.213 --> 42:00.545
Is the bomber dead?

42:00.547 --> 42:02.381
- Yeah.
- Fuck!

42:02.383 --> 42:04.316
Fuck!

42:06.286 --> 42:07.586
Something's going on.

42:07.588 --> 42:09.554
- Yeah, you got shot.
- Yeah, no shit!

42:09.556 --> 42:10.856
You shot me!

42:12.959 --> 42:14.559
No, I mean,
something's going on.

42:14.561 --> 42:16.595
None of this...
None of this makes sense.

42:16.597 --> 42:18.964
Just breathe, okay?
Deep breaths. Come on.

42:23.569 --> 42:25.537
Come here.

42:25.539 --> 42:28.206
Come closer.

42:28.208 --> 42:30.108
Where the fuck is Saul?

43:40.313 --> 43:42.547
You have a good flight?

43:42.549 --> 43:44.282
Yeah, fine.

43:46.285 --> 43:47.919
Got me here.

43:53.860 --> 43:56.962
All the money is there.

43:56.964 --> 43:59.197
Hey. This way.

43:59.199 --> 44:01.099
Wait here.

44:24.857 --> 44:27.692
In another month,
it's even hotter.

44:27.694 --> 44:29.661
You won't believe.

44:29.663 --> 44:31.196
Maybe I use the $10 million

44:31.198 --> 44:32.931
to put in an air conditioner.

45:03.196 --> 45:04.529
There.

You're alive.

46:04.243 --> 46:05.365
What now?

46:05.460 --> 46:06.879
ON THE NEXT HOMELAND

46:07.010 --> 46:08.541
<i>We both know what you've done.</i>

46:09.769 --> 46:11.230
<i>We both know what you are.</i>

46:12.374 --> 46:13.630
<i>I'm offering you a chance...</i>

46:14.538 --> 46:16.005
<i>to be the man you were...</i>

46:17.307 --> 46:18.947
<i>before they broke him.</i>

46:20.272 --> 46:22.719
<i>You will do this
one last thing.</i>

46:23.161 --> 46:24.287
<i>Doubt that.</i>

46:24.818 --> 46:26.079
We'll see about that.
