00:00.115 --> 00:02.052
Previously on "12 Monkeys"...

00:02.490 --> 00:04.692
Because of you, my
friend is on a mission,

00:04.717 --> 00:06.751
and now I'm having these nightmares.

00:06.753 --> 00:08.193
Someone is gonna die.

00:08.925 --> 00:10.191
Deacon.

00:10.216 --> 00:11.529
Ready to get the hell out of here?

00:11.554 --> 00:12.818
Aah!

00:14.779 --> 00:17.239
There is no way anybody
could have survived this.

00:17.264 --> 00:18.430
Butterfly.

00:18.455 --> 00:20.388
That wasn't there before.

00:22.344 --> 00:23.510
What is it?

00:23.512 --> 00:25.112
Our way home.

00:25.114 --> 00:26.980
I didn't come here to kill the Witness.

00:26.982 --> 00:30.279
I came here to kill his mother.

00:31.318 --> 00:32.877
The Witness...

00:32.902 --> 00:34.535
is your son.

00:36.749 --> 00:38.025
Olivia told Ramse.

00:38.027 --> 00:39.359
She knows.

00:39.361 --> 00:40.779
It's why he came after you.

00:40.804 --> 00:42.715
- It's why I had to...
- I'm so sorry.

00:44.099 --> 00:46.027
According to Dr. Railly and Mr. Deacon,

00:46.052 --> 00:48.135
at some point in the next year,

00:48.137 --> 00:50.668
this facility will be destroyed.

00:50.693 --> 00:52.172
Destroyed?

00:52.174 --> 00:54.273
- How?
- You tell us.

00:54.298 --> 00:55.998
You're the new head of security.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.333
We don't know how or exactly when,

00:58.335 --> 01:01.136
which only exacerbates
the urgency of our mission.

01:01.138 --> 01:04.382
Once again, we are running out of time.

01:05.429 --> 01:08.010
You spent months in
Titan with the enemy.

01:08.012 --> 01:09.178
What can you tell us?

01:09.180 --> 01:11.046
They knew we'd go to Titan.

01:11.048 --> 01:13.048
They were waiting to take him from me.

01:13.050 --> 01:15.384
I was kept in isolation...

01:15.386 --> 01:18.253
by a man who eventually let me escape.

01:18.255 --> 01:20.589
Did you see anyone besides
this man and the acolytes

01:20.591 --> 01:22.124
who tried to stop you from escaping?

01:22.126 --> 01:23.325
I saw four of them.

01:23.327 --> 01:25.205
They splintered him away, Cole.

01:26.197 --> 01:27.611
Our son.

01:29.066 --> 01:31.400
They're guarding him...

01:31.402 --> 01:32.885
from us.

01:32.910 --> 01:35.270
Listen, in a minute, you're
gonna have to go in there.

01:35.272 --> 01:37.727
Jones is gonna want you
to tell her everything.

01:37.752 --> 01:39.308
- Okay.
- Don't.

01:43.481 --> 01:45.647
Did you encounter the Witness?

01:45.649 --> 01:47.649
We were moving through time,

01:47.651 --> 01:50.452
waiting for him to return to Titan.

01:50.454 --> 01:51.748
Return?

01:51.773 --> 01:53.186
She tried to pull me off the mission

01:53.211 --> 01:55.224
for being emotionally compromised.

01:55.226 --> 01:56.725
Cole...

01:56.727 --> 02:00.362
if Ramse had killed me
before you and I met,

02:00.364 --> 02:02.364
no Witness,

02:02.366 --> 02:03.825
no plague.

02:03.850 --> 02:05.167
No.

02:05.169 --> 02:07.035
This is our problem.

02:07.037 --> 02:09.037
We'll figure it out.

02:09.038 --> 02:12.563
Until then, no one can know.

02:13.178 --> 02:14.657
No one.

02:15.548 --> 02:17.188
Dr. Railly...

02:17.986 --> 02:20.687
in all your time in Titan,

02:20.712 --> 02:24.847
were you ever able to discover
the identity of the Witness?

02:24.849 --> 02:26.749
Learn his origin?

02:29.403 --> 02:30.903
No.

02:48.028 --> 02:52.372
<font color="#007700">Synced and corrected by Aaronnmb</font>
www.addic7ed.com

02:59.100 --> 03:02.147
You guys can take a break. I got this.

03:05.623 --> 03:06.861
Cameras.

03:06.886 --> 03:09.487
I rebooted it. You got six minutes.

03:11.378 --> 03:13.045
Dr. Railly...

03:13.070 --> 03:15.047
it's good to see you.

03:15.049 --> 03:17.049
You bounce back quickly.

03:17.051 --> 03:19.051
You sent Ramse to kill me.

03:19.053 --> 03:21.220
I sent him to kill the Witness.

03:21.222 --> 03:22.554
You've always known?

03:22.556 --> 03:24.342
Just a suspicion...

03:24.904 --> 03:28.594
but when James returned
without his brother...

03:28.596 --> 03:30.248
proof.

03:31.605 --> 03:34.122
You haven't told Katarina, have you?

03:34.147 --> 03:35.667
Smarter than I give you credit for...

03:35.669 --> 03:38.237
- What do you want?
- Answers.

03:38.239 --> 03:40.105
Just like you.

03:40.107 --> 03:42.940
I devoted my life to your son's will.

03:43.799 --> 03:46.096
He promised a world without pain,

03:46.121 --> 03:47.651
without death.

03:48.182 --> 03:50.182
Yet here we are.

03:50.184 --> 03:51.850
Your "House of Cedar and Pine,"

03:51.852 --> 03:55.037
it was about his life, not mine.

03:55.062 --> 03:58.257
He lied. I want to know why.

03:58.259 --> 04:00.577
And we're just supposed to
trust you're gonna keep all this

04:00.602 --> 04:01.935
to yourself, huh?

04:01.937 --> 04:03.514
What's your other option?

04:04.102 --> 04:07.284
The three of us are now
unified in purpose...

04:07.309 --> 04:09.271
to find the Witness.

04:09.296 --> 04:10.795
I have a way to do that.

04:10.820 --> 04:12.956
I will never believe a word you say.

04:12.981 --> 04:15.359
My word is verifiable.

04:15.384 --> 04:17.059
How?

04:17.685 --> 04:20.687
I believe Jennifer is
working on that as we speak.

04:22.391 --> 04:23.510
Word.

04:25.075 --> 04:26.826
What is that?

04:26.828 --> 04:28.112
Our next mission...

04:28.137 --> 04:30.137
should you choose to accept it.

04:30.162 --> 04:32.676
And I thought this day could
not deliver any worse news.

04:32.701 --> 04:35.556
And here we go.

04:35.581 --> 04:37.404
You want to find the Witness, kids?

04:37.406 --> 04:38.480
I know how!

04:38.505 --> 04:40.607
When I was a kid, I
used to keep a diary...

04:40.609 --> 04:42.475
all the rules I wanted to break

04:42.477 --> 04:45.645
and all the wacky shenanigans
needed for success.

04:45.647 --> 04:47.014
But...

04:47.516 --> 04:49.516
I'd always, always get caught.

04:49.518 --> 04:51.050
I'd go and do a thing,

04:51.052 --> 04:53.386
and there she'd be,
Mommy-not-so-dearest.

04:53.388 --> 04:55.486
How did she know?

04:55.511 --> 04:56.556
Hmm!

04:56.558 --> 04:57.625
My diary.

04:57.650 --> 05:00.059
Turns out, I was
writing about the future

05:00.061 --> 05:01.311
in the past tense...

05:01.336 --> 05:02.938
#PrimaryProblems.

05:02.963 --> 05:05.330
What's your point, Ms. Goines?

05:05.332 --> 05:07.332
The Witness also kept a diary.

05:07.334 --> 05:09.334
Seen it with my own
eyes in Monkey Mansion.

05:09.336 --> 05:10.836
It's like their bible,

05:10.838 --> 05:13.705
from Genesis to Revelation
back to Genesis again.

05:13.707 --> 05:15.188
This led us to Titan.

05:15.190 --> 05:16.721
Ramsey tore that off a document

05:16.746 --> 05:18.166
- in Berlin.
- Ah.

05:18.191 --> 05:20.119
So you all have been chasing
the Monkeys for years,

05:20.144 --> 05:22.487
but this word is your
chance to get ahead of them?

05:22.512 --> 05:24.057
We'd have to go back to Berlin.

05:24.082 --> 05:25.229
If we went back there and stole it,

05:25.254 --> 05:27.736
we would never have the piece to
locate Titan in the first place.

05:27.760 --> 05:29.119
- Hmm.
- What about after?

05:29.144 --> 05:30.877
Kirschner's lab would
be too heavily guarded.

05:30.902 --> 05:32.540
So no before, no after...

05:32.565 --> 05:35.367
What about between the
lab and Monkey Mansion?

05:35.392 --> 05:36.725
Kirschner's daughter would know.

05:36.750 --> 05:38.195
- Hmm.
- We should ask her.

05:38.220 --> 05:39.551
Way ahead of you, Jonesy.

05:39.553 --> 05:43.406
Sit back and enjoy the tale of...

05:43.431 --> 05:46.086
the Word of the Witness...

05:48.895 --> 05:51.429
A combo platter of history and prophecy,

05:51.431 --> 05:55.300
a fruit smoothie of will,
was, and woulda-coulda-shoulda.

05:55.302 --> 05:58.234
Everything you always wanted
to know about the Witness,

05:58.259 --> 06:00.297
but didn't know how to ask.

06:00.322 --> 06:02.440
When the Army of the
12 Monkeys fled Germany,

06:02.465 --> 06:04.508
they couldn't leave
their manifesto behind,

06:04.533 --> 06:07.289
but were afraid to move it
through official channels.

06:07.314 --> 06:09.870
So it was smuggled out of Germany

06:09.895 --> 06:13.063
in the frame of an antique painting...

06:13.065 --> 06:14.275
"Constance."

06:14.900 --> 06:16.752
But "Constance" was stolen

06:16.768 --> 06:19.274
and lost to The Monkeys
for nearly three decades

06:19.299 --> 06:23.023
until it resurfaced at
an auction house in 1989.

06:23.048 --> 06:25.670
That's when Olivia...

06:25.695 --> 06:28.563
bought it and brought
it to Monkey Mansion.

06:30.175 --> 06:32.133
Assault on Monkey Mansion?

06:32.158 --> 06:33.468
Storm the castle?

06:33.470 --> 06:34.868
I like it. I want in.

06:34.893 --> 06:36.026
Uh-uh, too risky.

06:36.028 --> 06:38.829
Causality snafus up the wazoo.

06:38.831 --> 06:40.764
But I got a better plan.

06:41.252 --> 06:43.800
The Colby-Adams
Metropolitan Auction House...

06:43.802 --> 06:47.156
incredibly posh, unbelievably snobbish.

06:47.181 --> 06:48.472
The year...

06:48.474 --> 06:50.507
1989!

06:50.509 --> 06:52.836
If you're pulling a heist, I want in.

06:52.861 --> 06:53.924
Okay, fine.

06:53.949 --> 06:55.728
This place is for rich assholes.

06:55.753 --> 06:58.336
While Deacon might have
the asshole part down pat,

06:58.361 --> 06:59.850
none of us pass for rich.

06:59.852 --> 07:01.977
But you have me, Otter Eyes.

07:02.002 --> 07:03.320
How are you gonna help us, Jennifer?

07:03.322 --> 07:05.322
It's 1989. You're four.

07:06.330 --> 07:08.189
No shit.

07:08.794 --> 07:11.528
Hello, Caroline Markridge.

07:11.530 --> 07:13.697
Wealthy heiress, compulsive shopper,

07:13.699 --> 07:15.032
borderline hoarder.

07:15.034 --> 07:16.733
How are you?

07:16.735 --> 07:18.568
- You're posing as your mother?
- Yes!

07:18.570 --> 07:20.899
I tell them I want to sell
off my collection of...

07:20.924 --> 07:23.055
whatever teacups, antique spoons,

07:23.080 --> 07:25.475
those dolls with the
creepy eyes that follow you,

07:25.477 --> 07:27.978
and insist on seeing
their security protocols.

07:27.980 --> 07:29.680
Next, we get the lay of the land.

07:29.682 --> 07:31.682
Come back after dark, and then...

07:31.684 --> 07:34.678
Scooby-Doo tiptoe style
through the storage area,

07:34.703 --> 07:36.947
dodge security, find the painting,

07:36.972 --> 07:38.738
and steal the Word.

07:40.742 --> 07:42.742
You're forgetting something.

07:42.744 --> 07:44.211
Causality, remember?

07:44.213 --> 07:45.745
We are not stealing it!

07:45.747 --> 07:47.713
We are borrowing it.

07:48.083 --> 07:49.950
You and Cassie take some of Jones'

07:49.952 --> 07:51.603
super-duper-splinter-me-now injections,

07:51.628 --> 07:54.578
and come back here with
the Word and make a copy,

07:54.603 --> 07:56.857
while me and Deacon stay
back there and make sure

07:56.859 --> 07:58.884
nobody notices our Maltese
"Constance" is missing

07:58.916 --> 08:00.549
its chewy secret center.

08:00.551 --> 08:03.924
Then you make a return splinter to '89,

08:03.949 --> 08:05.854
we put the Word back where we found it,

08:05.879 --> 08:07.356
Olivia buys the painting...

08:07.358 --> 08:09.034
- Sold.
- ... none the wiser.

08:09.059 --> 08:11.125
Causality intact.

08:21.396 --> 08:24.965
Ms. Goines, that...

08:26.099 --> 08:28.645
is a remarkably cogent plan.

08:30.136 --> 08:32.496
Simple, executable...

08:33.039 --> 08:35.207
I'm impressed.

08:35.590 --> 08:37.933
Cassie and I should go. The
two of us can handle this.

08:37.958 --> 08:40.378
No, no, I believe Ms.
Goines and Mr. Deacon

08:40.380 --> 08:41.745
can be of assistance.

08:41.770 --> 08:43.167
You should all go.

08:47.920 --> 08:50.187
- What are you waiting for?
- Yes!

08:50.189 --> 08:52.937
This tape will self-destruct
in five seconds.

08:52.962 --> 08:56.093
I'm gonna need all your sizes.
I have some costume ideas.

08:57.931 --> 08:59.631
"The House of Cedar and Pine."

08:59.656 --> 09:01.594
1957. Us.

09:01.619 --> 09:02.951
That's how Olivia knew.

09:02.976 --> 09:04.289
Everything is on that document.

09:04.298 --> 09:06.553
- If anyone else sees it...
- They won't.

09:06.578 --> 09:08.547
Whatever it says about us,
we'll destroy that part.

09:08.572 --> 09:10.768
Jones will never know.

09:10.770 --> 09:13.270
We just need to get
to the painting first.

09:13.272 --> 09:15.239
And if we don't?

09:18.786 --> 09:21.086
You almost died in Titan.

09:21.088 --> 09:22.563
You sure you're up for this?

09:22.588 --> 09:24.588
Somebody's got to watch your back.

09:27.128 --> 09:29.695
Am I the only one getting
a weird Cole/Cassie vibe

09:29.697 --> 09:31.433
since they got back?

09:33.234 --> 09:35.768
Well, he just lost Ramse.

09:35.770 --> 09:37.238
Right.

09:45.112 --> 09:46.384
My turn.

09:48.229 --> 09:49.848
Ms. Goines...

09:49.850 --> 09:51.424
remember...

09:51.449 --> 09:53.211
your plan...

09:53.236 --> 09:54.915
your mission...

09:55.556 --> 09:57.723
your responsibility.

09:57.725 --> 09:59.725
If it goes awry...

09:59.727 --> 10:03.017
please have the good sense to pull back.

10:03.480 --> 10:05.611
Any other advice, Jonesy?

10:07.101 --> 10:08.947
Don't fuck up.

10:09.971 --> 10:12.443
A real Tony Robbins, this one.

10:14.842 --> 10:16.942
Initiate splinter sequence.

10:54.307 --> 10:56.486
Follow me, Ms. Markridge.

10:56.511 --> 10:58.844
This is our secure storage area.

10:58.869 --> 11:01.915
Items are only removed
from this area for preview

11:01.917 --> 11:03.417
and at time of auction.

11:03.419 --> 11:05.285
When that happens, a
guard brings the piece

11:05.287 --> 11:07.787
from secure storage
to the bidding floor,

11:07.812 --> 11:09.834
where an auction employee
is there to receive it.

11:09.859 --> 11:12.560
Your pieces are never left unattended.

11:12.585 --> 11:14.655
How secure is this...

11:14.680 --> 11:16.463
secure storage?

11:16.465 --> 11:20.100
We expected more vault, less shelving.

11:20.102 --> 11:23.170
I assure you, this entire
building is a vault,

11:23.172 --> 11:25.872
- Miss...
- Patty, my assistant.

11:25.874 --> 11:28.375
It says here her name is Cassandra.

11:28.377 --> 11:29.743
- It isn't.
- It is.

11:29.745 --> 11:30.876
Maybe...

11:30.901 --> 11:32.993
I go through so many assistants,

11:33.018 --> 11:35.439
I don't have time to learn their names.

11:36.995 --> 11:39.129
I have a question about the auction.

11:39.154 --> 11:41.488
We heard you recovered "Constance."

11:41.490 --> 11:43.223
Can we get a sneak peak?

11:43.225 --> 11:45.092
How did you know about "Constance?"

11:45.094 --> 11:47.357
We haven't announced it yet.

11:48.297 --> 11:51.732
She's a really good assistant.

11:52.654 --> 11:54.134
Unfortunately,

11:54.136 --> 11:56.003
I can't give you a preview yet.

11:56.005 --> 11:58.171
The painting is en route from Austria.

11:58.173 --> 11:59.906
But the auction is tomorrow.

11:59.908 --> 12:01.141
It wasn't going to auction.

12:01.143 --> 12:03.043
We had a private collector interested.

12:03.045 --> 12:05.912
But if there is more
than one party interested,

12:05.914 --> 12:09.249
I have a financial
obligation to put it up...

12:09.251 --> 12:12.119
- Uh...
- There is.

12:12.121 --> 12:15.822
Ms. Markridge is definitely
interested in "Constance."

12:15.824 --> 12:16.855
Excellent.

12:16.880 --> 12:18.692
Well, then I will alert the office,

12:18.694 --> 12:20.427
and they can inform the other party.

12:20.429 --> 12:22.480
If you'll excuse me.

12:23.966 --> 12:25.786
What did you just do?

12:25.811 --> 12:27.678
Abort, abort, abort the mission!

12:27.703 --> 12:28.802
Why?

12:28.827 --> 12:31.310
Olivia said she bought it at
auction. It's going to auction.

12:31.335 --> 12:33.440
Olivia said she bought
it at an auction house.

12:33.442 --> 12:35.375
She was never at the auction.

12:35.377 --> 12:37.208
Unless, of course, we
just screwed that up.

12:37.233 --> 12:39.112
We are doing this, Jennifer.

12:39.114 --> 12:41.381
Calm down, everything will be fine.

12:43.952 --> 12:46.299
I hope we didn't change things.

12:48.962 --> 12:50.824
Thank you for keeping me informed.

12:50.826 --> 12:52.844
I'll alter my plans immediately.

13:11.146 --> 13:14.271
1989... what a trip.

13:14.296 --> 13:16.849
You know they were playing
Genesis in the lobby?

13:16.874 --> 13:19.041
You really shouldn't
let Jennifer dress you.

13:19.066 --> 13:22.032
I will have a scotch,
neat, with a beer back.

13:23.975 --> 13:27.004
- Here you go.
- Cheers to you.

13:27.029 --> 13:29.563
I got to say, you surprised
the hell out of me.

13:29.565 --> 13:31.714
- How's that?
- Hmm.

13:31.739 --> 13:33.357
Ramse...

13:34.904 --> 13:37.474
I didn't think you had it in you.

13:38.890 --> 13:40.224
Ahh.

13:41.692 --> 13:43.747
He's dead, and you did
not fire up the machine

13:43.772 --> 13:45.762
to go and save him.

13:46.282 --> 13:48.145
So much for the bromance.

13:49.433 --> 13:51.308
That's how he wanted it.

13:51.333 --> 13:54.165
Old José grew a conscience
in his final moments?

13:54.190 --> 13:55.896
Color me surprised.

13:56.592 --> 13:58.225
He did what he thought was right.

13:58.227 --> 14:00.763
Bullshit. He's no martyr.

14:00.788 --> 14:04.256
His whole "I'm gonna kill
the world to save my son"...

14:05.067 --> 14:07.234
- Selfish prick.
- Shut your mouth.

14:07.236 --> 14:11.205
Please. He barely knew that kid.

14:11.532 --> 14:12.706
It's probably for the best

14:12.708 --> 14:15.579
because Ramse was not a good guy.

14:16.204 --> 14:17.978
None of us are.

14:17.980 --> 14:19.847
Sam would've turned out the same way.

14:19.849 --> 14:22.182
I'm not gonna tell you again.

14:22.184 --> 14:24.051
Poor, poor Ramse.

14:24.053 --> 14:26.587
Are you mad because the
Monkeys put a bullet in him

14:26.589 --> 14:29.590
or because you didn't have
the stones to do it yourself?

14:31.867 --> 14:33.383
Hey!

14:34.298 --> 14:36.241
What the hell is going on?

14:36.266 --> 14:37.531
Nothing.

14:37.533 --> 14:38.866
Good.

14:38.868 --> 14:40.868
Because we have a problem.

14:47.300 --> 14:48.742
The painting's not here yet.

14:48.744 --> 14:50.744
It's not gonna arrive until
right before the auction.

14:50.746 --> 14:52.746
So we steal it from
them before the auction?

14:52.748 --> 14:54.681
No, no, no!

14:54.683 --> 14:55.936
Olivia could get suspicious.

14:55.961 --> 14:58.619
She needs to buy the painting,
and never know we were here.

14:58.621 --> 15:01.163
Okay, we just need to figure
out another way to get it.

15:01.188 --> 15:04.360
Or we reconsider the
idea of an armed assault.

15:04.385 --> 15:05.893
Jennifer's right.

15:05.918 --> 15:07.401
It's too risky.

15:07.426 --> 15:08.996
We don't even know what's on this thing.

15:08.998 --> 15:11.698
This is the only
record of the Witness...

15:11.700 --> 15:14.206
where he's been, what he's done.

15:14.231 --> 15:15.610
We know what he's done.

15:15.635 --> 15:18.105
We don't need to get to know
him. We just need to stop him.

15:18.107 --> 15:19.506
Okay, guys, "Heat"!

15:19.508 --> 15:20.574
"Inside Men."

15:20.576 --> 15:21.680
"Ocean's Eleven."

15:21.705 --> 15:23.602
Ah... "Thomas Crown Affair."

15:24.815 --> 15:26.374
Wait!

15:26.399 --> 15:28.390
We need a Trojan horse!

15:28.415 --> 15:31.251
Smuggle ourselves into
the building tonight.

15:31.276 --> 15:33.410
So we're already in place
before the painting shows up

15:33.412 --> 15:34.797
in the morning.

15:34.822 --> 15:37.147
Sneaking around like that gives
us a much smaller window...

15:37.149 --> 15:38.392
minutes, maybe.

15:38.423 --> 15:39.861
I am not signing up for any plan

15:39.886 --> 15:41.675
that has me hiding inside anything.

15:41.700 --> 15:43.698
I am done with small spaces.

15:43.722 --> 15:44.907
Okay, fine.

15:44.932 --> 15:46.504
You and Jennifer can go
in through the front door.

15:46.529 --> 15:47.779
We're gonna need a distraction.

15:47.804 --> 15:50.037
You buy us as much time as possible.

15:50.062 --> 15:51.795
Once we have the Word,

15:51.820 --> 15:53.786
Jones will pull you back.

15:58.044 --> 16:00.092
Guess that leaves you and me.

16:01.173 --> 16:03.660
So where do we get the horse?

16:06.878 --> 16:10.046
How many antique cars
does your father have?

16:10.048 --> 16:12.615
Enough to need a warehouse.

16:13.985 --> 16:17.717
He likes to collect
things, keep them locked up.

16:19.725 --> 16:21.391
Was it weird?

16:21.393 --> 16:23.360
Pretending to be your mother?

16:23.362 --> 16:25.680
I didn't have to go
all Method or anything.

16:26.398 --> 16:29.766
That'd require me being
100% more homicidal.

16:31.126 --> 16:33.284
We could change that...

16:33.309 --> 16:35.009
for you.

16:35.034 --> 16:36.534
It's 1989.

16:36.559 --> 16:38.408
Your mother tries to drown you in '91.

16:38.410 --> 16:41.211
We could warn someone,
maybe get you some help.

16:43.565 --> 16:44.869
I don't know who I'd be

16:44.894 --> 16:47.900
if I wasn't the kid whose
mom tried to kill her.

16:48.712 --> 16:51.601
Sort of a defining moment
in one's life, you know.

16:53.839 --> 16:55.619
What about you?

16:56.328 --> 16:58.328
All this time traveling...

16:58.330 --> 17:01.431
you ever think of going
back to see your mom...

17:01.433 --> 17:03.433
get that good-bye?

17:07.439 --> 17:11.567
Lately, I find myself missing
the talks we never got to have.

17:13.845 --> 17:16.137
There's a lot I wish I could ask her.

17:19.184 --> 17:21.184
Here we go.

17:24.723 --> 17:28.858
Oh, my daddy's gonna be so pissed.

17:34.749 --> 17:37.004
No, I'm sorry, ma'am. I got nothing.

17:38.230 --> 17:40.386
But I was just here this afternoon.

17:40.388 --> 17:42.088
Yeah, I see that, but nobody told us

17:42.090 --> 17:44.019
that you guys were
auctioning off a car, okay?

17:44.044 --> 17:45.858
I can't let something through
without the proper paperwork.

17:45.860 --> 17:47.230
It's got to go back.

17:47.728 --> 17:49.355
Well, it can't.

17:50.204 --> 17:52.105
I can't drive stick.

17:52.767 --> 17:54.551
Night blindness.

17:54.576 --> 17:56.101
Sun's down.

17:56.126 --> 17:58.105
Blind as a bat.

17:58.106 --> 17:59.882
Who'd you say this belonged to?

18:00.655 --> 18:03.357
- Bugsy Seagal.
- Siegel.

18:03.382 --> 18:05.444
Mobster, bootlegger,

18:05.446 --> 18:06.796
criminal visionary.

18:06.821 --> 18:08.545
- Founded Las Vegas.
- Uh-uh

18:08.570 --> 18:11.215
Oh, I hear that Warren Beatty
is gonna do a film about him.

18:11.240 --> 18:12.485
- I'd see that.
- Yeah.

18:12.487 --> 18:14.487
Might even bid on the car.

18:14.489 --> 18:15.842
Sal, maybe we should call somebody.

18:15.867 --> 18:17.800
Maybe we should talk
about it in the office.

18:17.825 --> 18:19.248
We can't go now. There's people here.

18:19.273 --> 18:21.214
I know we can't. You
never call somebody.

18:21.239 --> 18:22.574
That's how you lose your job.

18:22.599 --> 18:23.863
Call somebody!

18:23.865 --> 18:25.798
You call them, and you call them now!

18:25.800 --> 18:28.988
You call them, or else I'm
gonna start calling someone

18:29.013 --> 18:31.737
because I have a cotillion to go to!

18:31.739 --> 18:33.287
Sal, hot lady's got
a cotillion to go to.

18:33.312 --> 18:34.692
I don't even know what a cotillion is.

18:34.717 --> 18:35.951
A cotillion's a formal ball,

18:35.976 --> 18:37.820
especially one where
debutantes are presented.

18:37.845 --> 18:39.348
No, it is not.

18:39.373 --> 18:41.747
- I...
- I think you should not call anybody.

18:41.749 --> 18:43.383
- No, you call them!
- The problem is...

18:43.408 --> 18:45.141
- Call! Call!
- She gets upset,

18:45.143 --> 18:46.346
- then the drinking...
- Call them on the phone!

18:46.371 --> 18:48.031
- then the hitting.
- She's saying to call somebody.

18:48.056 --> 18:49.589
He's saying not to call somebody.

18:52.640 --> 18:54.506
I got a mortgage to pay, all right?

18:54.531 --> 18:56.025
- I got a wife...
- Take it easy!

18:56.050 --> 18:58.264
- Call someone! Call someone!
- The drinking...

18:58.289 --> 19:00.963
We're on the same team! Okay! Okay!

19:00.988 --> 19:03.292
The car stays! That's
the new rule that I made.

19:03.294 --> 19:04.377
My prerogative, okay?

19:04.402 --> 19:05.734
Everybody's happy. God bless.

19:05.759 --> 19:07.326
No calls are being made!

19:07.351 --> 19:09.209
We'll deal with it in the morning.

19:09.211 --> 19:12.221
It was a pleasure doing
business with you. Thank you.

19:12.246 --> 19:13.636
You're welcome.

19:15.240 --> 19:16.434
You know what? That
tall drink of water...

19:16.459 --> 19:18.225
- I could take him out.
- You couldn't take him out.

19:18.250 --> 19:20.371
If things went down,
I knew you had my back.

19:21.746 --> 19:24.046
Jesus. Don't these assholes ever leave?

19:27.412 --> 19:29.018
You okay?

19:29.020 --> 19:30.442
Yeah.

19:30.756 --> 19:33.629
We've been in smaller spaces before.

19:33.992 --> 19:35.527
When?

19:35.910 --> 19:37.895
Our bed in '59...

19:39.364 --> 19:42.012
that tiny, thin mattress.

19:43.368 --> 19:44.777
Squeaked.

19:46.106 --> 19:48.332
You remember all that, huh?

19:52.078 --> 19:53.894
Why didn't you tell me?

19:55.246 --> 19:57.676
I know... the storms were coming.

19:57.701 --> 19:59.868
And that timeline... that...

19:59.899 --> 20:03.229
life had to be erased, but...

20:05.123 --> 20:07.019
we could've done it together.

20:07.651 --> 20:10.518
I didn't want to put
you through all that.

20:13.436 --> 20:14.915
If I hadn't remembered on my own,

20:14.940 --> 20:17.454
would you have told me what we lost?

20:20.663 --> 20:22.663
You didn't need to know.

20:25.494 --> 20:27.537
I got time to do a quick shit?

20:27.562 --> 20:29.444
- How long do you need? I mean...
- A three.

20:29.469 --> 20:30.858
- Three? Hours?
- Yeah.

20:30.883 --> 20:32.543
No, no. Three hours?

20:32.568 --> 20:33.735
You said three. What were you gonna do?

20:33.760 --> 20:35.579
A number three? What's a number three?

20:35.604 --> 20:37.344
Pee and shit at the same time...
two plus one equals three.

20:37.369 --> 20:39.008
I never heard it before.
That's why I asked you.

20:39.033 --> 20:40.649
You ever do a four?

20:40.674 --> 20:43.102
Once by accident...
LaGuardia Airport, 1982.

20:47.673 --> 20:49.188
They're leaving.

21:01.718 --> 21:04.423
You rest up, I'm gonna go keep watch.

21:04.448 --> 21:06.399
Hey, Cole?

21:08.334 --> 21:11.106
You can't take this all on yourself.

21:11.770 --> 21:13.981
It's not your fault.

21:14.506 --> 21:16.506
Yes, it is.

21:18.510 --> 21:20.710
You didn't know me before.

21:23.051 --> 21:25.048
Before we met,

21:25.050 --> 21:27.785
I killed people for nothing...

21:28.262 --> 21:30.262
for scraps.

21:30.264 --> 21:32.004
Families.

21:32.029 --> 21:34.363
I did whatever I had to do.

21:34.388 --> 21:36.817
But you did it to survive.

21:37.806 --> 21:39.426
Did I?

21:39.824 --> 21:42.976
I just killed the only
conscience I've ever had.

21:44.704 --> 21:46.937
And now I find out that the
man behind the apocalypse

21:46.962 --> 21:48.617
is my son.

21:49.317 --> 21:51.406
So I get it now.

21:52.287 --> 21:54.187
Get what?

21:54.189 --> 21:56.445
If there's something wrong with him...

21:57.192 --> 21:59.773
something inside that makes him...

22:02.130 --> 22:04.328
he got it from me.

22:17.709 --> 22:20.597
We should give people a
chance. Allow them to leave.

22:20.628 --> 22:22.294
You heard what Cassandra
and Deacon said.

22:22.296 --> 22:24.103
This place will be
destroyed, no survivors.

22:24.128 --> 22:25.495
We don't know that,

22:25.520 --> 22:27.120
and there's still time
to find a way to stop it.

22:27.184 --> 22:28.683
We have no idea how much time we have.

22:28.708 --> 22:31.119
It could happen tomorrow, today.

22:31.144 --> 22:32.843
We need to evacuate.

22:32.868 --> 22:34.735
I'm not abandoning our home.

22:34.737 --> 22:37.517
This isn't a home. It's
a laboratory, a bunker.

22:37.542 --> 22:39.106
This is my home!

22:39.108 --> 22:40.975
And I will not be chased from it.

22:40.977 --> 22:43.310
Don't be a selfish, old
fool. Save the lives you can.

22:43.312 --> 22:45.112
I refuse to surrender,

22:45.114 --> 22:47.815
to accept that this is
the world that we deserve!

22:47.817 --> 22:49.100
Move on!

22:49.125 --> 22:51.664
The machine cannot be moved!

22:56.726 --> 22:58.953
You're never gonna win
an argument with her.

22:59.729 --> 23:01.662
Believe me, I know.

23:01.664 --> 23:03.130
She's so focused on saving the past,

23:03.132 --> 23:04.858
she never thinks about the future.

23:04.883 --> 23:06.987
Doesn't sound like there is one.

23:07.012 --> 23:08.511
You went to 2163.

23:08.536 --> 23:10.269
You said the world was dead.

23:10.294 --> 23:12.989
So we're gonna die either way.

23:13.439 --> 23:15.736
Why not go down fighting?

23:34.593 --> 23:37.831
I ever tell you what I
wanted to be when I grew up?

23:38.163 --> 23:39.867
Architect.

23:39.869 --> 23:42.084
Told my father I
wanted to grow up and...

23:42.109 --> 23:44.359
design my mother her dream house.

23:44.740 --> 23:46.140
Then the plague hit.

23:46.142 --> 23:47.941
And you became a soldier.

23:47.943 --> 23:51.111
Spearhead, this place...

23:51.113 --> 23:53.280
they were never home...

23:53.282 --> 23:56.416
but I-I figured if I
couldn't build something...

23:57.073 --> 23:59.571
at least I could protect something.

23:59.596 --> 24:00.924
So I thought.

24:00.949 --> 24:03.305
Knowing the fate of our
facility and staying here

24:03.330 --> 24:05.893
makes me insane by definition.

24:05.895 --> 24:08.368
Time travel sounded pretty insane, too,

24:08.393 --> 24:10.533
when you first told me about it.

24:11.891 --> 24:14.033
It also sounded like hope.

24:15.501 --> 24:19.006
You're already working on
another batshit-crazy plan

24:19.031 --> 24:21.031
to get us out of this mess, aren't you?

24:24.421 --> 24:26.335
The craziest.

24:38.845 --> 24:41.448
I didn't come here to kill the Witness.

24:43.027 --> 24:46.402
I came here to make
sure he was never born.

24:48.169 --> 24:50.855
I came here to kill his mother.

24:50.880 --> 24:52.581
Ramse, stop!

24:57.614 --> 24:59.206
Wandered around while you were asleep,

24:59.231 --> 25:00.808
found the office.

25:03.738 --> 25:05.995
When's the last time you slept?

25:06.436 --> 25:08.253
I'm not sure.

25:08.828 --> 25:10.745
What time is it?

25:12.982 --> 25:14.503
My watch is gone.

25:16.420 --> 25:17.597
Do you see it?

25:17.629 --> 25:19.409
It has to be in here somewhere.

25:19.434 --> 25:20.737
This is the last place.

25:20.762 --> 25:22.519
Well, we have to find it.

25:22.544 --> 25:25.157
Let's, uh, retrace your steps.

25:25.182 --> 25:27.064
These are my steps.

25:30.622 --> 25:31.839
Wait.

25:32.723 --> 25:33.922
I got it.

25:37.497 --> 25:39.964
Hate for it to not be there
when you find my corpse.

25:44.997 --> 25:46.769
You're a good man.

25:48.272 --> 25:51.273
I wouldn't have fallen in
love with you if you weren't.

25:57.677 --> 26:00.878
Sometimes I think we are
just stuck in a loop...

26:01.452 --> 26:03.987
creating the problems
we're trying to solve...

26:04.755 --> 26:07.628
- Ramse, Olivia.
- I don't believe that.

26:08.326 --> 26:10.073
We can change things.

26:10.815 --> 26:12.777
You mean him...

26:12.802 --> 26:14.802
our son.

26:14.827 --> 26:16.308
That's why you want to find the Word.

26:16.333 --> 26:18.366
You think you can save him.

26:28.212 --> 26:30.913
Whoa! I'm having major déjà vu.

26:32.296 --> 26:34.004
Ms. Markridge?

26:34.029 --> 26:36.812
Hello. I understand
you dropped a vehicle by

26:36.837 --> 26:38.757
- last evening, to be auctioned off?
- Yes.

26:38.782 --> 26:41.124
You can start the bid at 100,000...

26:41.149 --> 26:42.648
50,000...

26:42.673 --> 26:44.896
10,000, I don't care.

26:44.921 --> 26:47.030
Uh, regardless, there is a
significant amount of paperwork

26:47.055 --> 26:48.630
needed to verify...

26:48.632 --> 26:50.946
- Oh, radical.
- Radical.

26:50.971 --> 26:53.116
Thank you so much for
taking care of this for me.

26:53.141 --> 26:55.704
Uh, no, ma'am. You don't understand.

26:55.729 --> 26:58.085
Oh, Monty, can you be a lamb?

26:59.217 --> 27:00.460
Oh, I'm Monty.

27:00.485 --> 27:02.419
Uh, look...

27:02.513 --> 27:05.514
Ms. Markridge has a bit
of the Brown Bottle Flu,

27:05.516 --> 27:07.436
if you know what I mean.

27:07.851 --> 27:09.384
Doing the drinking.

27:09.386 --> 27:11.386
Yeah. So good news for you...

27:11.388 --> 27:13.555
she will be nursing that hangover

27:13.557 --> 27:16.224
with a whole lot of spending.

27:16.226 --> 27:18.997
So what do you say?

27:19.022 --> 27:20.896
Paperwork later?

27:22.599 --> 27:24.599
Good luck out there, ma'am.

27:24.601 --> 27:26.037
You're welcome.

27:30.607 --> 27:33.508
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no...
- Holy shit, it's Gozer.

27:33.510 --> 27:35.510
She's not supposed to be here.

27:43.796 --> 27:45.396
And sold...

27:45.398 --> 27:47.848
- to bidder 337... again.
- Yes!

27:49.766 --> 27:53.155
Now, next up, we have
a jeweled necklace...

27:53.180 --> 27:54.217
Ooh, sparkly.

27:54.242 --> 27:57.225
Shall we start the bidding at 40,000?

27:57.250 --> 27:59.241
- 45,000!
- 45,000.

27:59.266 --> 28:00.858
- And 50,000?
- 50,000!

28:00.883 --> 28:02.883
Madam, you do realize...

28:02.908 --> 28:04.633
- that you're bidding against yourself?
- 65,000!

28:04.658 --> 28:06.389
Very well. Sold...

28:06.414 --> 28:08.009
to bidder 337.

28:08.011 --> 28:09.877
You gonna buy the whole building?

28:09.879 --> 28:11.139
Don't bother me. I'm stress-bidding.

28:11.164 --> 28:12.830
Maybe they already got
it and splintered back.

28:12.855 --> 28:14.388
No, if it was mission accomplished,

28:14.413 --> 28:15.998
they would have yanked us back already.

28:16.023 --> 28:17.928
Lights would flicker... we'd
get that not-so-fresh feeling.

28:17.953 --> 28:19.989
- Ooh!
- Ms. Markridge?

28:20.014 --> 28:21.248
I'm sorry, but you've purchased

28:21.273 --> 28:23.686
a great deal more than we anticipated.

28:23.711 --> 28:25.359
You've exceeded your credit limit.

28:25.361 --> 28:26.592
Okay, then raise it.

28:26.617 --> 28:28.117
We simply can't raise it.

28:28.142 --> 28:29.608
- We need to call your...
- Well, then call!

28:29.638 --> 28:31.074
Call! I don't care who you call.

28:31.100 --> 28:32.600
What are you doing here? Call!

28:32.602 --> 28:34.135
And sold again...

28:34.137 --> 28:36.426
- to bidder 337.
- Yes!

28:37.004 --> 28:39.846
Of course, I appreciate that
these people have families.

28:39.871 --> 28:41.004
I love families.

28:41.006 --> 28:42.551
I'm a family man,

28:42.576 --> 28:45.209
which is why I know they
make terrific leverage.

28:45.234 --> 28:47.340
So, unless your team wants to go home

28:47.365 --> 28:48.847
and explain...

28:48.872 --> 28:51.027
Hold on, I got another call.

28:51.762 --> 28:53.066
Yeah?

28:54.152 --> 28:55.819
My wife?

28:55.821 --> 28:57.454
Oh, my wife's in L.A.

28:57.456 --> 28:59.691
at some bullshit new-age

28:59.716 --> 29:02.526
I-Ching Tarot card retreat.

29:02.551 --> 29:04.549
Lust or must?

29:04.574 --> 29:06.248
Do you think that's an
armadillo or an aardvark?

29:06.273 --> 29:07.606
How much?

29:07.608 --> 29:09.027
Sold. Sold.

29:09.052 --> 29:12.105
Sold again, once more to 337.

29:12.130 --> 29:14.447
If she even so much
as drops another nickel

29:14.472 --> 29:15.658
on your floor...

29:16.747 --> 29:18.384
Yes! 75,000, 75,000!

29:18.386 --> 29:19.551
Me, me!

29:19.553 --> 29:20.552
Going two, going two...

29:20.554 --> 29:22.087
Sold to me, yes!

29:22.089 --> 29:23.436
I'm on my way.

29:23.958 --> 29:25.557
Jennifer, we got to go.

29:25.559 --> 29:27.292
Skating lesson's gonna
have to wait, okay?

29:27.294 --> 29:28.520
- Yes!
- No!

29:28.545 --> 29:31.325
Hey! Don't blame me. Blame your mother.

29:32.566 --> 29:34.266
Oh, dude, about the thing last week...

29:34.268 --> 29:35.483
That must be the painting.

29:35.508 --> 29:37.748
My second cousin... turns
out she know papier-mâché,

29:37.795 --> 29:39.204
so she patched it up.

29:39.206 --> 29:41.073
Nobody knew the difference on it.

29:41.075 --> 29:42.574
All right.

29:42.576 --> 29:44.576
I put "To Paul, best wishes."

29:47.180 --> 29:48.866
Watercolor era.

29:48.891 --> 29:50.582
Franco-Prussian.

29:50.584 --> 29:52.100
That's good art.

29:53.053 --> 29:54.653
I got Connie. I'm bringing her down.

29:54.655 --> 29:56.522
"Constance," not Connie.

29:56.524 --> 29:57.998
"Constance."

29:58.553 --> 30:00.125
You distract him. I'll grab it.

30:02.653 --> 30:05.358
I'm told "Constance" just arrived.

30:05.383 --> 30:06.772
I want to see it.

30:06.797 --> 30:09.001
- It's processing.
- Who's my competitor?

30:11.536 --> 30:13.539
Oh, my God, that's the best one yet.

30:17.349 --> 30:18.980
Who's that? Who is...

30:20.347 --> 30:22.214
Sal, we're waiting.

30:22.216 --> 30:24.049
Ghosts aren't real.

30:24.051 --> 30:25.717
Ghosts aren't real.

30:25.719 --> 30:28.300
Do I have to come down there
and get the damn thing myself?

30:31.748 --> 30:33.748
And sold...

30:33.773 --> 30:36.394
- Yes!
- ... again to bidder 337.

30:36.396 --> 30:39.197
Now, up next, we have...

30:40.267 --> 30:42.000
Oh, uh, ladies and gentlemen,

30:42.002 --> 30:44.335
up next, we're going
to have an intermission.

30:44.337 --> 30:47.205
So please relax, have some refreshments,

30:47.207 --> 30:49.752
and we'll resume the bidding shortly.

30:50.077 --> 30:51.409
The bar is open.

30:51.411 --> 30:52.838
Thank God.

30:53.947 --> 30:55.516
Something's wrong.

30:55.541 --> 30:57.793
Go backstage and get me that painting.

30:59.786 --> 31:02.754
- Want to go get some snacks?
- I want to get a drink.

31:02.756 --> 31:04.756
- They probably have snacks at that bar.
- Yeah.

31:04.781 --> 31:06.538
- Whoa!
- Wait, what?

31:06.563 --> 31:07.792
Who is that?

31:07.794 --> 31:09.794
Another personal demon...

31:09.796 --> 31:11.129
my father.

31:13.166 --> 31:14.799
Hello?

31:20.841 --> 31:22.304
Good!

31:22.329 --> 31:23.563
Good reflexes.

31:23.588 --> 31:26.413
- You're on the job.
- Yeah, I'll take it.

31:26.438 --> 31:27.977
Who are you?

31:28.381 --> 31:30.774
Detective, uh, Morrison...

31:31.084 --> 31:33.821
plainclothes, uh, warehouse detail.

31:33.846 --> 31:35.012
- Detective?
- Yeah.

31:35.037 --> 31:37.165
- Security.
- Nice.

31:37.190 --> 31:39.023
Uh, Larry didn't tell
you I was coming down?

31:39.048 --> 31:41.360
- No.
- It's, uh...

31:41.385 --> 31:43.061
it's about the car.

31:43.063 --> 31:45.071
What happened to the car?

31:46.602 --> 31:49.093
Stolen. It was stolen.

31:49.118 --> 31:51.336
Stolen? I... You see?

31:51.338 --> 31:53.071
You see what it is? I trust people.

31:53.073 --> 31:54.165
I knew she was crazy.

31:54.190 --> 31:56.402
She had it right... right there.

31:56.427 --> 31:59.888
You need to cover me,
okay? Create a distraction.

31:59.913 --> 32:01.112
Throw something or something.

32:01.114 --> 32:02.929
Oh, shit! You...

32:04.323 --> 32:07.252
- I'm sorry, do I know you?
- Not if I can help it.

32:09.512 --> 32:11.122
Is there something wrong with her?

32:11.124 --> 32:12.643
You have no idea.

32:12.668 --> 32:14.001
Excuse me a moment.

32:14.026 --> 32:16.196
All right, everybody! Be cool!

32:16.221 --> 32:18.363
This is a robbery!

32:18.365 --> 32:20.776
- Please don't shoot!
- Fine.

32:21.877 --> 32:24.068
Yeah, it's like a formal ball,

32:24.093 --> 32:26.876
especially one where
debutantes are presented.

32:26.901 --> 32:29.774
Anyway, from one detective to another,

32:29.776 --> 32:31.563
I think we need to fire Larry.

32:31.588 --> 32:34.776
Sal, where the hell is "Constance?"

32:36.850 --> 32:38.183
Ah, shit.

32:40.440 --> 32:41.886
Oof!

32:45.225 --> 32:48.226
Where is it? Where is it?

32:51.817 --> 32:53.627
There it is.

33:02.465 --> 33:03.908
I got no medical.

33:08.778 --> 33:09.991
Shit!

33:40.673 --> 33:43.099
It's good to have you back.

33:50.806 --> 33:52.094
Valuables, Pop...

33:52.119 --> 33:53.385
in the bag.

33:53.410 --> 33:55.431
You can at least put your gun away.

33:55.456 --> 33:56.956
You're frightening my daughter.

33:56.981 --> 33:59.014
Yay! This is fun!

33:59.039 --> 34:00.572
Are you sure about that?

34:00.597 --> 34:03.865
Christ, Jennifer, can't
you be normal for once?

34:08.679 --> 34:10.344
Look...

34:10.386 --> 34:12.132
sparkly.

34:13.969 --> 34:15.188
Listen, kid,

34:15.213 --> 34:18.625
I'm gonna tell you something
very important, okay?

34:18.862 --> 34:20.458
Your dad...

34:20.484 --> 34:22.351
is an asshole.

34:22.799 --> 34:24.554
Never forget that.

34:27.431 --> 34:29.938
Olivia was telling the truth.
It's hidden behind the painting.

34:29.963 --> 34:31.829
We just need to go through it,
find anything incriminating,

34:31.853 --> 34:33.547
tear it out. No one will ever know.

34:33.572 --> 34:35.045
It's right..

34:36.206 --> 34:37.414
here.

34:38.664 --> 34:40.909
But it's not here.

34:43.080 --> 34:45.781
- It's not here, Cass.
- Yes, I can see that, James.

34:47.952 --> 34:51.286
- Okay, let's just retrace your steps.
- These are my steps!

34:51.288 --> 34:53.266
Where the hell is it, then?

34:54.291 --> 34:56.158
It's okay.

34:56.159 --> 34:59.027
I think I was supposed to go left.

34:59.029 --> 35:00.896
- Aah!
- Oh, my God!

35:00.898 --> 35:02.698
What are you doing here?

35:02.700 --> 35:04.700
Did you see who did this?

35:07.171 --> 35:09.390
There's a barbarian out there,

35:09.415 --> 35:12.929
and he's got a gun, and
he's robbing the place blind!

35:12.954 --> 35:14.910
Just stay calm.

35:14.912 --> 35:16.244
Oh, my God!

35:16.246 --> 35:17.946
He's thieving...

35:17.948 --> 35:19.281
and "burglaring"...

35:20.818 --> 35:23.422
and pilfering.

35:25.322 --> 35:26.688
Oh, my God.

35:26.690 --> 35:28.123
Oh!

35:28.125 --> 35:29.858
Oh, boy! Sorry, sorry, sorry.

35:29.860 --> 35:32.009
I'm sorry. This is Ms. Scarlet

35:32.034 --> 35:34.968
with the candlestick in the library.

35:34.993 --> 35:36.650
Okay.

35:37.134 --> 35:39.908
911, what's the nature
of your emergency?

35:42.284 --> 35:43.634
Hello?

35:44.916 --> 35:46.449
Holy shit.

35:46.474 --> 35:47.708
I got it.

35:47.711 --> 35:49.156
I got it.

36:01.927 --> 36:04.058
Ah, yeah.

36:04.083 --> 36:06.448
Let's bring this puppy home.

36:23.781 --> 36:26.406
You brought us here!

36:26.431 --> 36:28.881
They were waiting for
you. They wanted you here.

36:28.906 --> 36:31.712
No beginning. No end.

36:32.916 --> 36:34.449
Oh, my God.

36:39.157 --> 36:42.508
Jesus Christ, what
the hell is the holdup?

36:42.533 --> 36:44.227
Why are we still here?

36:44.252 --> 36:45.494
You got our money, pal.

36:45.496 --> 36:47.897
Have you existential
crisis somewhere else.

36:49.567 --> 36:51.291
Oh, shit.

36:51.728 --> 36:53.041
Police!

36:57.637 --> 37:00.086
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

37:00.088 --> 37:02.861
To find your mother.

37:04.382 --> 37:05.705
Come on.

37:10.369 --> 37:12.306
I got to say...

37:12.790 --> 37:14.885
you look just like her.

37:15.814 --> 37:18.274
Even got my wife's whole...

37:18.299 --> 37:20.329
crazy-eyes thing going.

37:20.865 --> 37:22.531
I do.

37:22.533 --> 37:26.672
You know, I came up working
in places like this...

37:26.697 --> 37:28.790
hating people like me...

37:29.204 --> 37:32.105
pocket-broke, rich in ambition,

37:32.130 --> 37:34.296
waiting my turn.

37:34.462 --> 37:35.978
No.

37:35.980 --> 37:37.847
I'm not like you.

37:37.849 --> 37:39.048
What is the play?

37:39.073 --> 37:40.797
Your friend out there is the distraction

37:40.822 --> 37:44.334
while you grab a couple Monets?

37:44.359 --> 37:47.407
Not really an oil painting kind of girl.

37:47.986 --> 37:50.422
Charcoal's more my thing.

37:52.407 --> 37:54.140
That's good.

37:54.165 --> 37:57.032
They don't let you use oils in prison.

37:57.527 --> 38:00.063
Cleaning agents are combustible.

38:01.205 --> 38:03.772
I'm gonna have you locked up.

38:08.375 --> 38:10.880
But I'm gonna survive it.

38:12.750 --> 38:15.469
My life's so much bigger now.

38:15.920 --> 38:18.257
And one day...

38:18.282 --> 38:20.422
you're gonna die.

38:20.766 --> 38:24.475
And that'll be the day when
she really starts to live.

38:26.163 --> 38:28.030
Ah!

38:30.159 --> 38:31.773
Aah!

38:38.175 --> 38:40.053
Come on.

38:40.078 --> 38:41.992
I'm a businessman.

38:42.491 --> 38:44.594
I'm sure we can make a deal.

38:45.053 --> 38:46.319
Let's go, Dad...

38:46.344 --> 38:48.117
Dad... Daddy-o.

38:52.524 --> 38:54.834
Okay, Egg, listen up.

38:54.859 --> 38:56.764
You're gonna see something weird,

38:56.789 --> 38:58.780
but don't be scared, okay?

38:58.805 --> 39:00.462
Okay, Chicken.

39:01.047 --> 39:02.464
See you soon, kiddo.

39:09.547 --> 39:10.940
Whoa.

39:12.586 --> 39:14.359
Jennifer, honey?

39:14.384 --> 39:16.250
Open the door.

39:16.275 --> 39:18.008
Jennifer?

39:18.033 --> 39:20.724
Come on, open the goddamn door!

39:22.932 --> 39:24.245
We're out of time.

39:24.270 --> 39:26.120
Let's find Deacon and Jennifer.

39:26.727 --> 39:28.010
Ugh!

39:28.035 --> 39:29.737
Someone's activated the tethers.

39:31.261 --> 39:33.238
Ah, sh...

39:39.676 --> 39:41.010
Let's go.

39:46.659 --> 39:48.120
Jones!

39:48.145 --> 39:50.479
You have to send us
back. We couldn't get it.

39:50.981 --> 39:53.659
Not to worry. Ms. Goines made us a copy.

40:05.898 --> 40:07.950
This is fascinating.

40:07.975 --> 40:10.115
I had to improvise.

40:10.633 --> 40:13.757
Good thing I wound up in
a room with a copy machine.

40:13.782 --> 40:15.165
It's all there.

40:15.506 --> 40:18.061
- We should come clean.
- We can't.

40:18.295 --> 40:19.618
Hey.

40:19.868 --> 40:21.768
We don't have a choice.

40:28.877 --> 40:30.277
Jones...

40:30.379 --> 40:32.162
What the hell is this?

40:37.631 --> 40:39.272
Oops.

40:45.460 --> 40:48.228
Making copies, making copies...

40:49.014 --> 40:50.931
Whoa, uh...

40:51.033 --> 40:52.928
I guess my hand slipped.

40:59.308 --> 41:00.974
I'm sorry, Jones.

41:01.076 --> 41:02.309
I effed up.

41:02.411 --> 41:04.110
Hell, no.

41:04.212 --> 41:06.313
Of this foursome, we
definitely were the two

41:06.415 --> 41:07.914
that did not screw up.

41:07.939 --> 41:09.572
What the hell happened
to you guys backstage?

41:11.610 --> 41:13.263
I'm sure they were dealing with a lot.

41:15.015 --> 41:17.668
We know more about the Witness
and the Army of The 12 Monkeys

41:17.693 --> 41:19.593
than we could have hoped for.

41:19.695 --> 41:22.162
Well done, Ms. Goines.

41:51.693 --> 41:54.260
Causality crisis averted.

41:54.363 --> 41:56.563
Cycle maintained.

41:58.200 --> 42:00.050
Come here.

42:00.457 --> 42:02.457
I want you to wear this.

42:04.702 --> 42:06.631
I don't believe in fate...

42:06.875 --> 42:09.342
in cycles or loops...

42:10.062 --> 42:11.490
but if it is all true

42:11.531 --> 42:13.980
and one day you find me
wearing this at the CDC...

42:14.082 --> 42:15.982
Cassie, this...

42:16.084 --> 42:18.591
As long as it's on your wrist...

42:20.956 --> 42:23.403
It means we'll always find
our way back to each other.

42:25.438 --> 42:27.233
Wearing this...

42:27.725 --> 42:31.155
means that somehow, someway...

42:31.922 --> 42:34.327
you're always gonna find
your way back to her.

42:42.944 --> 42:45.912
Sometimes I think we
are just stuck in a loop.

42:49.885 --> 42:51.785
No matter what.

42:53.155 --> 42:55.121
The Witness...

42:56.938 --> 42:58.992
he's your son.

42:59.278 --> 43:03.460
_

43:30.569 --> 43:33.655
Allow us to introduce you to...

43:34.702 --> 43:36.863
the Witness.
