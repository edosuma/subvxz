00:20.585 --> 00:22.065
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:34.991 --> 00:37.211
Yeah.

01:35.443 --> 01:37.097
Help!

02:27.843 --> 02:30.933
Look at me, boy.

02:30.976 --> 02:34.110
Cryin' ain't buyin'
in this world.

02:34.154 --> 02:37.809
All them cowboy books...

02:37.853 --> 02:41.291
none of 'em ever cries,
does they?

02:43.685 --> 02:47.906
Them boys that took your money,
they was older than you?

02:47.950 --> 02:50.039
Scared you.

02:50.082 --> 02:52.737
You didn't like
how that feel, did you?

02:52.781 --> 02:56.567
Feel like got ice in your spine,

02:56.611 --> 02:59.048
ants in your belly.

02:59.091 --> 03:03.531
Feel like you wanna crawl
instead of walk like a man.

03:06.316 --> 03:09.537
Now that hurt, didn't it?
But only on the outside.

03:09.580 --> 03:11.887
Life is full of things gonna
hurt you on the inside.

03:11.930 --> 03:14.455
Hurt you bad, real bad.

03:14.498 --> 03:18.372
Hurt you so bad, make you wanna
shrivel up and get small,

03:18.415 --> 03:21.549
disappear like
you ain't you no more.

03:23.290 --> 03:25.640
Them boys took more than
your money.

03:25.683 --> 03:29.339
They took what made you, you.

03:29.383 --> 03:31.646
Somebody take something from
you, you got two choices...

03:31.689 --> 03:35.171
One you can live with,
one you can't.

03:35.215 --> 03:38.653
Man don't stand up
for what's his,

03:38.696 --> 03:41.177
ain't no man.

03:41.221 --> 03:44.354
Now you know what you
gotta do, son.

03:46.487 --> 03:49.925
Take it back.

03:58.673 --> 04:01.719
You one sorry ass sight.

04:01.763 --> 04:04.026
You know what you need
to do, son?

04:04.069 --> 04:06.768
You gotta take it back.
Do it to it.

04:06.811 --> 04:10.685
Yippee-ki-yay!
Hi-ho Silver and away!

04:45.415 --> 04:47.374
Hey.

04:47.417 --> 04:50.377
What happened to the squirrel?

04:50.420 --> 04:51.856
I shot him.

04:51.900 --> 04:53.902
What'd he do?

04:53.945 --> 04:55.817
Snuck up on me.

04:57.862 --> 05:00.212
They'll do that to ya.

05:00.256 --> 05:01.866
You got a minute?

05:05.392 --> 05:07.916
Yeah.

05:07.959 --> 05:09.396
Sit down.

05:13.661 --> 05:15.489
Not that one.

05:27.109 --> 05:28.632
You talk to Leonard recently?

05:28.676 --> 05:30.417
Nope.

05:30.460 --> 05:33.376
He's healin' up fast.

05:33.420 --> 05:36.336
Good.

05:36.379 --> 05:39.295
Think it's about time you
went by to see him, though,

05:39.339 --> 05:40.992
don't you think?

05:42.777 --> 05:45.519
Yeah.

05:45.562 --> 05:47.303
I will.

05:53.440 --> 05:56.356
I know what happened
in that alley was bad.

05:59.402 --> 06:03.058
Sometimes under stress,

06:03.101 --> 06:07.584
fellas close to skin and bone
can feel kind of...

06:07.628 --> 06:09.847
Kind of what?

06:11.545 --> 06:14.809
Kind of a postpartum-style
depression.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.814
Me and Leonard didn't
have no babies.

06:19.857 --> 06:22.643
All right, postpartum
scary event syndrome, then.

06:22.686 --> 06:24.122
I think you're just
making shit up.

06:24.166 --> 06:26.690
Look...

06:30.477 --> 06:32.043
Something bad happens
to a couple fellas

06:32.087 --> 06:35.003
and they survive,

06:35.046 --> 06:38.310
they tend to...
blame each other.

06:38.354 --> 06:40.965
Find ways not to be around
one another

06:41.009 --> 06:43.925
'cause when they are, it just...

06:43.968 --> 06:48.538
brings 'em right back
to where it all happened.

06:51.715 --> 06:53.761
I love Leonard.

06:58.069 --> 07:00.115
He's my brother.

07:05.250 --> 07:09.472
W-when I saw that knife
at his balls, I...

07:11.648 --> 07:15.217
I was glad
it was him and not me.

07:20.831 --> 07:22.703
And he knew that.

07:30.319 --> 07:32.756
He saw it in my eyes.

07:32.800 --> 07:35.498
Hell.

07:35.542 --> 07:39.894
I'm glad it was Leonard
in that alley and not me.

07:39.937 --> 07:42.984
It's just the way it is.
We... we just human.

07:43.027 --> 07:47.989
Them people in that alley,
they... they weren't human.

07:48.032 --> 07:51.601
Yeah, they were.

07:51.645 --> 07:54.474
We can be some mean monkeys.

07:54.517 --> 07:56.171
You and Leonard met
a couple of 'em,

07:56.214 --> 08:00.175
and they just took
a chunk out ya ass

08:00.218 --> 08:03.047
and a piece of your heart.

08:11.316 --> 08:14.494
You know, sometimes you gotta
stare your shadows in the eye.

08:14.537 --> 08:18.628
Or see if they got eyes.

08:18.672 --> 08:21.718
You don't,
they just gonna whoosh.

08:21.762 --> 08:24.678
Flutter around you
the rest of your life.

08:24.721 --> 08:27.898
In the end, we all just end up
like that squirrel out there.

08:30.814 --> 08:33.164
Goodbye, Charlie.

09:31.919 --> 09:34.138
You hear from Cantuck?

09:34.182 --> 09:35.618
Crickets.

09:37.402 --> 09:38.882
Shit.

09:43.757 --> 09:45.889
You know, -Don't say it, Charlie.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.476
Odds are they ain't
gon' find her.

10:10.566 --> 10:13.613
And even if they do...

10:13.656 --> 10:15.658
it ain't gonna be
the way you hopin'.

10:18.182 --> 10:21.098
Either way, she's gone, partner.

10:29.672 --> 10:32.806
I should've went there
the first time she called.

10:34.372 --> 10:35.765
Hell, I should've put
my foot down,

10:35.809 --> 10:38.638
never let her go
in the first place.

10:38.681 --> 10:41.684
Instead, I send them
two dumb dickwads.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.599
Well, hell,
them two dumb dickwads

10:43.643 --> 10:45.645
are in pretty bad shape.

10:45.688 --> 10:47.690
You know what I meant. Now
them two dumb dickwads

10:47.734 --> 10:50.084
almost got themselves killed
doing you a favor.

10:50.127 --> 10:52.695
Save it, Detective. Doin' your job
you should've done yourself.

10:52.739 --> 10:56.438
Shut up, Charlie.

10:56.481 --> 10:58.895
You know, they ain't always got
their shit together, them two.

10:58.919 --> 11:01.486
Hell, they almost never
got their shit together.

11:01.530 --> 11:04.054
But by God, them boys
you can count on.

11:04.098 --> 11:07.275
But then they'd know that if
you'd gone out to check on 'em.

11:08.972 --> 11:11.235
I got my own conscious.
I don't need yours on top of it.

11:11.279 --> 11:13.063
Horseshit.

11:17.415 --> 11:20.244
Sorry, but I couldn't help
overhear some of that.

11:20.288 --> 11:21.918
That son of a bitch
burns me up sometimes.

11:21.942 --> 11:25.075
Well, that's because sometimes
that son of a bitch is right.

11:33.170 --> 11:34.868
What do you want, Peg?

11:36.739 --> 11:38.915
Phone call for you. Line two.

11:46.183 --> 11:48.185
Lieutenant Hanson speaking.

12:04.941 --> 12:07.770
Hey, you... you goin' somewhere?

12:07.814 --> 12:10.468
I-I was comin' to see you.

12:12.253 --> 12:13.602
Okay.

12:13.645 --> 12:14.995
Charlie said you was,

12:15.038 --> 12:17.780
holed up like Dean Martin
in "Rio Bravo," so...

12:17.824 --> 12:21.262
Yeah. I hate it
when Charlie's right.

12:22.654 --> 12:24.831
Yeah, I do, too.

12:26.354 --> 12:28.225
Well, um, so...

12:28.269 --> 12:31.185
we good?

12:31.228 --> 12:33.361
Yeah, we good.

12:33.404 --> 12:34.754
All right.

12:40.934 --> 12:43.327
Hey, look...

12:43.371 --> 12:44.676
I just want to thank you

12:44.720 --> 12:46.548
for putting my pecker
back in my pants.

12:47.897 --> 12:50.117
I know it wasn't easy for ya.

12:50.160 --> 12:53.207
Well, no big thing, Leonard.

12:58.865 --> 13:00.257
Come here.

13:00.301 --> 13:02.956
All right, all right, All right, yeah.

13:04.305 --> 13:07.438
You need to listen
to this again.

13:07.482 --> 13:08.918
Come on.

13:25.239 --> 13:27.763
Yeah.

13:30.461 --> 13:32.768
What'd that sound like to you?

13:32.812 --> 13:36.119
Some kind of big machine
or somethin'.

13:36.163 --> 13:39.340
Right. Something like
a wood chipper.

13:42.778 --> 13:45.302
Exactly like a wood chipper.

13:45.346 --> 13:49.306
Like the one they got out
at Brown's Christmas tree farm?

13:49.350 --> 13:52.657
Jesus.

13:52.701 --> 13:55.530
We was right.

13:55.573 --> 13:57.532
And that...

13:57.575 --> 14:01.362
thatis why we couldn't find her.

14:01.405 --> 14:04.582
Son of a bitch.
You tell Hanson about this?

14:04.626 --> 14:07.934
No. Not yet.

14:07.977 --> 14:10.153
You know, I'm thinking
we don't tell him.

14:10.197 --> 14:13.940
Those boys down at Grovetown,

14:13.983 --> 14:16.333
they think
they're above the law.

14:18.509 --> 14:20.381
They got good reason
for thinking that,

14:20.424 --> 14:22.818
and his name is Truman Brown.

14:32.567 --> 14:34.047
Every time I hear that name,

14:34.090 --> 14:36.658
I just wanna crawl up
under the bed.

14:36.701 --> 14:39.356
Yeah.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.054
Yeah, me, too.

14:44.231 --> 14:47.103
There was a time I used
to think I was unbreakable.

14:49.540 --> 14:53.283
Now I hear a sound, I tense up.

14:53.327 --> 14:55.807
Hear the same sound,
I shit my pants.

14:57.331 --> 14:59.942
Just keep seeing that crowd

14:59.986 --> 15:02.423
comin' for me.

15:04.860 --> 15:07.645
Tell you the truth,

15:07.689 --> 15:09.909
if they were to come back
for me again...

15:12.650 --> 15:14.217
I'd probably curl up like
a little baby

15:14.261 --> 15:18.265
and let 'em take me. No, you wouldn't.

15:18.308 --> 15:20.702
You ain't got it in you.

15:20.745 --> 15:23.966
I don't know about that, Hap.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.973
I've been sleeping with
a goddamn revolver

15:31.017 --> 15:33.628
under my pillow.

15:33.671 --> 15:35.195
Does that sound like me?

15:35.238 --> 15:38.241
Shit. Hell, I'm sleeping
with a shotgun.

15:38.285 --> 15:41.375
Yes, it... it does
sound like you.

15:41.418 --> 15:45.379
I cry at night, Hap.

15:45.422 --> 15:47.337
I break down.

15:49.252 --> 15:52.647
I keep having these nightmares.
It's... it's like...

15:54.562 --> 15:57.304
I keep feeling them
just beatin' and kickin' on me.

15:57.347 --> 16:01.090
No.

16:01.134 --> 16:03.092
I know. Me, too.

16:04.789 --> 16:09.229
When I wake up, I'm still there.

16:09.272 --> 16:15.061
Well, this ain't just
about... Florida no more.

16:15.104 --> 16:21.023
This is about you
and it's about me.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.286
And it's about Brown paying

16:23.330 --> 16:26.594
for what he is
and what he'd done.

16:26.637 --> 16:29.945
Shit.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.295
We gotta go back
to Grovetown, don't we?

16:32.339 --> 16:34.297
Yeah.

16:34.341 --> 16:36.473
We do.

16:37.997 --> 16:41.130
I was hoping you'd say that.

16:41.174 --> 16:44.046
This time, we go,
we gotta go all the way.

16:44.090 --> 16:46.005
Sun up or sun down.

16:46.048 --> 16:49.182
Got any guns left
besides that shotgun?

16:49.225 --> 16:52.489
No.

16:52.533 --> 16:54.143
But I know who do.

16:59.844 --> 17:02.673
You guys going out there
to punch some Klan lights out?

17:02.717 --> 17:05.762
- That's the plan.
- Take your choice. No charge.

17:05.807 --> 17:07.896
Yeah. Warms my heart
just thinking about

17:07.939 --> 17:09.941
blowing some holes
in them freaks.

17:09.984 --> 17:11.421
You guys need some help?

17:11.464 --> 17:12.920
You know me and Clinton
sure wouldn't mind

17:12.944 --> 17:16.078
whupping some Klan ass. Damn sure don't.

17:16.122 --> 17:17.949
It ain't your battle.

17:17.992 --> 17:19.299
Thanks.

17:21.127 --> 17:23.215
Put them guns away.

17:34.531 --> 17:36.707
Hell, no.

17:40.407 --> 17:43.410
Special Agent Glen, FBI.

17:43.453 --> 17:45.107
Chief Cantuck is dead.

17:45.151 --> 17:47.240
What? Somebody put a bullet
through his head.

17:47.283 --> 17:50.721
- Jesus.
- Now Chief Reynolds told me

17:50.765 --> 17:53.289
that you two went down
to Grovetown. ChiefReynolds?

17:53.333 --> 17:55.335
That sure happened fast?-

17:55.378 --> 17:57.467
Said you showed up in Grovetown,

17:57.511 --> 17:59.252
you assaulted
some of the townfolk,

17:59.295 --> 18:01.186
you had a disagreement with
the Chief, and then you left.

18:01.210 --> 18:03.908
Bullshit. We were the ones
who were assaulted.

18:03.952 --> 18:05.867
I got 12 witnesses
who say different.

18:05.910 --> 18:07.564
From what I hear,
you got your head

18:07.608 --> 18:09.697
up the Klan's ass, Chief.

18:09.740 --> 18:12.178
Hey, hey, hey. No smoking
in my house, Charlie.

18:12.221 --> 18:13.701
You're right. Sorry.

18:13.744 --> 18:15.920
Now I was there.
I can vouch for these two.

18:15.964 --> 18:17.879
Who will vouch for you?

18:17.922 --> 18:19.576
You were out of
your jurisdiction without

18:19.620 --> 18:22.144
the professional courtesy
to tell us you were there.

18:22.188 --> 18:23.798
Well, Sneed and Bacon,
they were there.

18:23.841 --> 18:26.105
They know what happened. That's
why we're here, dumb-ass.

18:26.148 --> 18:29.020
They're suspects in Cantuck's
murder and they're missing.

18:29.064 --> 18:31.936
And I'm thinking you two
tell me where they are.

18:31.980 --> 18:34.069
No, we can't.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.940
Not a clue.

18:35.984 --> 18:37.594
Sneed used to live in Laborde.

18:37.638 --> 18:40.119
He's got history with
all four of these guys.

18:40.162 --> 18:41.598
Trust me, we don't miss him.

18:41.642 --> 18:44.123
You haven't seen him, have you?

18:44.166 --> 18:45.863
How 'bout you,
Lieutenant Hanson?

18:45.907 --> 18:48.214
This is myjurisdiction now.

18:48.257 --> 18:49.824
And I don't like
your implication.

18:49.867 --> 18:52.957
The murder of a police officer
is a federal case,

18:53.001 --> 18:55.395
so your jurisdiction
just became his.

18:55.438 --> 18:58.006
I suggest we hold these two
as material witnesses.

18:58.049 --> 19:01.009
No, hold on. No one's getting
arrested right now, Chief.

19:01.052 --> 19:05.231
Agent Glen, if I may?
Who brought the Feds in on this?

19:05.274 --> 19:07.407
Call came from
the Governor himself.

19:07.450 --> 19:08.906
He wanted me to follow up
on a tip he got

19:08.930 --> 19:10.323
from a Grovetown resident,

19:10.366 --> 19:12.542
one whose opinion he values
highly.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.155
Wouldn't happen to be
Truman Brown, would it?

19:16.198 --> 19:18.200
Brown's one of the men
they assaulted.

19:18.244 --> 19:20.637
So why don't you go on back
to Grovetown,

19:20.681 --> 19:23.205
wash out your Klan robe?

19:30.256 --> 19:32.693
Not in my house.

19:41.484 --> 19:42.964
Here's what's gonna happen next.

19:43.007 --> 19:45.271
Collins and Pine,
you're gonna stay right here.

19:45.314 --> 19:48.230
We'll call it house arrest
for now as material witnesses.

19:48.274 --> 19:51.625
You two, you better get
your ducks in a row

19:51.668 --> 19:53.279
'cause I'm-a start digging.

19:53.322 --> 19:55.082
This hole gets deep enough,
you might end up in it.

19:55.106 --> 19:58.545
As for now, I suggest everybody
gets a good night sleep

19:58.588 --> 20:00.503
and calls their lawyers.

20:00.547 --> 20:03.637
I-I would if I could,
but I can't, so...

20:05.421 --> 20:07.380
Chief Reynolds,
you come with me.

20:07.423 --> 20:09.773
Y'all have a Happy New Year now.

20:15.736 --> 20:19.174
That woman oughta rattle
before she bites.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.132
She make me glad I'm gay.

20:28.357 --> 20:30.359
Lord, as I give my spirit
over to you,

20:30.403 --> 20:32.796
the power of love
and a sound mind.

20:32.840 --> 20:35.843
Yea, thou I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

20:35.886 --> 20:39.325
I will fear no evil,
for Thou art with me.

20:39.368 --> 20:42.458
Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me

20:42.502 --> 20:45.331
all the days of my life.

20:45.374 --> 20:47.202
Goodness and mercy.

20:49.857 --> 20:52.294
Hello.

20:54.644 --> 20:56.951
If you're out there,
please help me!

20:58.735 --> 21:00.868
Help!

21:00.911 --> 21:04.132
Somebody out there.

21:04.175 --> 21:07.962
Hi! Can you help me, please?

21:08.005 --> 21:10.399
Can you help me?
I'm locked in here.

21:10.443 --> 21:13.359
Hey. Hey, girl, I-I know you.

21:13.402 --> 21:14.882
I've seen you before.

21:14.925 --> 21:16.318
Can... can you find something

21:16.362 --> 21:19.060
to... to pry the trunk
open with?

21:19.103 --> 21:21.715
Can you help me? I-I-I think
there's a crowbar or something

21:21.758 --> 21:23.847
around here somewhere.

21:23.891 --> 21:26.110
Wait! Wait, where you goin'?!

21:26.154 --> 21:28.374
Wait, get me out of here,
please!

21:28.417 --> 21:32.247
Please, I gotta find somebody
to help! Please, get me out!

21:32.291 --> 21:33.683
Please!

21:41.648 --> 21:43.084
Told ya they'd run.

22:24.734 --> 22:26.649
Hello, officer.

22:26.693 --> 22:29.652
Hey! What's happenin'?

23:05.427 --> 23:07.124
Hell, no. No! Mnh-mnh.

23:09.475 --> 23:11.259
Yeah.Whoo.

23:11.302 --> 23:14.436
That's better.

23:17.439 --> 23:20.050
What do you think all them
switches are for?

23:20.094 --> 23:21.661
I don't know.

23:21.704 --> 23:23.271
Must be the bass or something.

23:23.314 --> 23:24.664
Whoa!

23:24.707 --> 23:26.579
- What the...
- Hey! Hold it!

23:26.622 --> 23:28.624
Hap! Hold the...

23:28.668 --> 23:30.626
Whoa!

23:30.670 --> 23:32.106
I am! I... Whoa! Aah!

23:32.149 --> 23:33.934
Whoa!

23:35.544 --> 23:38.242
Okay, whoa!

23:38.286 --> 23:40.375
I think I just swallowed
one of my kidneys.

23:40.419 --> 23:42.725
Don't touch them switches!

23:42.769 --> 23:44.205
You told me to touch it!

23:44.248 --> 23:46.773
Hey, I asked you
what they were for.

23:46.816 --> 23:49.210
Man! Damn.

23:49.253 --> 23:51.778
It don't get much better
than that.

23:51.821 --> 23:53.954
Sonny Knox here,
taking some licks,

23:53.997 --> 23:58.175
but keeping things afloat here
at 96.6.

23:58.219 --> 24:00.395
Moses got nothing on us.

24:00.439 --> 24:03.659
Flash flood warnings are
in effect for the entire region,

24:03.703 --> 24:05.792
and we just got word that
they're pumping out

24:05.835 --> 24:07.228
the Old Mill Dam

24:07.271 --> 24:09.143
to keep it from overflowing...

24:09.186 --> 24:12.799
unlike my radio station,
which seems like a wading pool.

24:12.842 --> 24:16.455
Yeah, kids,
stay home, no school,

24:16.498 --> 24:18.892
no buses, make some
hot chocolate,

24:18.935 --> 24:21.503
and drive your parents crazy.

24:21.547 --> 24:24.898
The Governor has declared
a state of emergency...

24:24.941 --> 24:27.466
and issued
a voluntary evacuation

24:27.509 --> 24:29.511
for all low-lying areas.

24:29.555 --> 24:32.383
I, Sonny Knox,
will keep you informed

24:32.427 --> 24:34.516
as the storm progresses.

24:34.560 --> 24:38.085
In the meantime, break out
the rowboats, life jackets,

24:38.128 --> 24:40.740
and settle down
for this classic riff.

24:40.783 --> 24:44.004
This one's coming to ya from.

24:44.047 --> 24:47.442
Brown's Christmas tree farm,
where everybody'schipper.

24:47.486 --> 24:50.010
We could've picked
a better time to do this.

24:50.053 --> 24:52.926
Next time we plan a war,

24:52.969 --> 24:55.450
remind me to
check the weather first.

25:09.508 --> 25:10.944
Wow.

25:10.987 --> 25:14.208
I thought you guys got away,
you stay away.

25:14.251 --> 25:16.776
Hey, Maude. Man.

25:16.819 --> 25:19.343
I'm sorry about all the mess.

25:19.387 --> 25:22.172
Well, things get be fixed.

25:22.216 --> 25:23.652
People can't.

25:23.696 --> 25:26.307
We lookin' for Truman Brown.

25:26.350 --> 25:28.265
What for?

25:28.309 --> 25:31.791
Son of a bitch Brown
runs this town now.

25:31.834 --> 25:33.662
Got that ice queen Reynolds
in his pocket.

25:33.706 --> 25:35.925
This what America's
supposed to be?

25:35.969 --> 25:38.145
I don't wanna live here no more.

25:38.188 --> 25:40.626
You know where he is?

25:40.669 --> 25:42.584
He's still in town.

25:42.628 --> 25:44.238
Anybody with half a brain
be gone by now,

25:44.281 --> 25:47.241
but he was by here with
his boys this morning.

25:47.284 --> 25:50.592
Why.

25:50.636 --> 25:52.246
Finish what we started.

25:52.289 --> 25:54.074
You're gonna be outgunned.

25:54.117 --> 25:55.554
Cut a snake off by the head,

25:55.597 --> 25:57.294
the body ain't worth shit
no more, right?

25:57.338 --> 25:59.732
Well, I guess you boys
owe him some.

25:59.775 --> 26:01.429
'Bout time somebody
had the balls

26:01.472 --> 26:04.214
to stand up to that
son of a bitch.

26:04.258 --> 26:06.129
You heard from Bacon?

26:06.173 --> 26:08.131
No.

26:08.175 --> 26:09.872
But I heard that
Brown and Reynolds

26:09.916 --> 26:12.483
are lookin' for him.

26:12.527 --> 26:16.575
They look hard enough,
they gon' find him.

26:16.618 --> 26:18.315
That was Slim Harpo... Right.

26:18.359 --> 26:22.406
With "Raining in My Heart,"
coming at you from 96.6.

26:22.450 --> 26:24.844
I'll be holding the water
back with a barrel of blues

26:24.887 --> 26:28.195
and keeping y'all up to date on
the latest storm development.

26:28.238 --> 26:31.198
Come on. Bye, Maude.

26:45.299 --> 26:47.170
Just got a special request

26:47.214 --> 26:49.608
from Hap Collins
and Leonard Pine.

26:49.651 --> 26:53.220
The boys are back in town
and would like Mr. Truman Brown

26:53.263 --> 26:55.396
to know they will be
waiting for him

26:55.439 --> 26:57.746
at Tim's Rocket Garage.

26:57.790 --> 26:59.618
So bring your noisemakers

26:59.661 --> 27:01.750
and join the boys
from Laborde...

27:01.794 --> 27:04.927
for a bang bang
New Tear celebration.

27:06.537 --> 27:08.888
Go get 'em, boys.

27:08.931 --> 27:10.803
Nice knowing you.

27:30.779 --> 27:34.000
Somebody, I'm in here!

27:34.043 --> 27:35.871
Can anybody...

27:56.805 --> 27:59.547
Damn!

27:59.590 --> 28:01.941
Damn it!

28:06.902 --> 28:10.732
Please, somebody help me!

28:13.126 --> 28:17.565
Help me!

28:17.608 --> 28:20.089
Somebody help me!

29:59.319 --> 30:01.016
Say, Hap.

30:02.844 --> 30:05.368
Maybe we shouldn't stand
in front of the gas pump.

30:07.936 --> 30:09.459
Yeah.

30:09.503 --> 30:10.896
Good thinking, Leonard.

30:39.663 --> 30:43.319
Maybe Truman Brown don't
listen to the blues.

30:43.363 --> 30:45.713
Maybe he like to listen
to that old gospel music.

30:48.020 --> 30:51.284
Then again, maybe not?

30:59.727 --> 31:02.643
Maybe this wasn't such
a good idea.

31:04.819 --> 31:07.430
We can always go home
and roast some marshmallows.

31:07.474 --> 31:09.998
Watch some TV.

31:10.042 --> 31:12.348
We can call Charlie over
to give us a puppet show.

31:12.392 --> 31:15.656
Yeah. That's starting
to sound like a good idea.

31:15.699 --> 31:17.310
Hello.

31:48.950 --> 31:50.821
This ain't a hold up, is it?

31:50.865 --> 31:52.432
No.

31:52.475 --> 31:54.216
But if you know
what's good for ya,

31:54.260 --> 31:56.697
you'll clear out before
the shootin' starts.

31:56.740 --> 31:58.394
Shootin'?

31:58.438 --> 32:00.005
You seen Truman Brown
and his boys?

32:00.048 --> 32:03.225
No. But I heard about that
run-in you had with him.

32:03.269 --> 32:04.879
Let me just, drop this car,

32:04.923 --> 32:07.229
and I'll clear out faster
than a scalded cat.

32:07.273 --> 32:08.990
I don't wanna be here
if y'all are gonna tango

32:09.014 --> 32:10.972
with Brown and his boys.

32:11.016 --> 32:12.931
I'll be out of your hair
in a jiff.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.681
Get up. Get up!

32:24.725 --> 32:26.814
Aah! Please don't
hit me no more!

32:26.857 --> 32:28.685
Just tell me the truth. Tell me!

32:28.729 --> 32:31.862
What happened to Florida?!
Where is she?!

32:31.906 --> 32:33.516
Okay, I'll tell you.

32:33.560 --> 32:35.083
I'll tell you!

32:40.088 --> 32:42.308
Tim, I'm gonna need
another night.

32:48.401 --> 32:49.837
I found it.

32:49.880 --> 32:51.665
Bobby Joe's granddaddy's
lost song.

32:51.708 --> 32:54.146
Get an earful. Come on.

32:54.189 --> 32:56.017
Ooh!

32:56.061 --> 32:58.150
This is worth a whole lot
of money, isn't it?

32:58.193 --> 32:59.978
Yeah, Bobby Joe said so.

33:00.021 --> 33:02.284
This belongs
to Bobby Joe's family.

33:02.328 --> 33:04.852
Let me introduce into evidence
a different point of view...

33:04.895 --> 33:06.854
It belongs to whoever finds it.

33:06.897 --> 33:08.987
That's not how this works.

33:10.292 --> 33:11.946
Hold on. Just a second.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.774
Look, I'm willing to split
with you, 50/50.

33:13.817 --> 33:15.471
What do you say?
We'll be partners.

33:15.515 --> 33:18.518
It's not ours to sell.

33:18.561 --> 33:20.737
Okay, 40/60.

33:23.305 --> 33:24.872
Wait a minute.
Just wait a minute.

33:24.915 --> 33:27.527
You ain't thinkin'
this through, sweetie.

33:30.095 --> 33:32.445
Don't ever call me sweetie.

33:35.883 --> 33:37.972
Stop it!

33:46.285 --> 33:48.069
No! Aah!

33:52.378 --> 33:53.944
Why did you do it?

33:53.988 --> 33:55.207
It wasn't me. I swear to you.

34:01.865 --> 34:05.130
What the hell?

34:15.183 --> 34:17.664
You killed her,
you son of a bitch!

34:17.706 --> 34:19.708
Hey, we got to find her!

34:22.147 --> 34:25.367
I didn't kill her.
I-I didn't do it.

34:25.411 --> 34:29.241
It was an accident.
I swear, an accident.

34:45.605 --> 34:47.041
Jeez.

35:33.218 --> 35:35.283
Look, please don't hurt me
again! Please don't hurt me! Get up!

35:35.307 --> 35:36.743
I'm just.

35:36.786 --> 35:38.484
Come on. Take us to her.

35:38.527 --> 35:39.876
Yeah, okay. Okay. Take us to her.

35:47.754 --> 35:49.930
Which one?

35:49.973 --> 35:51.540
! Come on!
- I don't remember!

35:51.584 --> 35:54.282
It was dark. It was a mistake.
You better remember!

35:54.326 --> 35:56.676
It's one of these!
I think it was one of these!

35:56.719 --> 35:58.721
Shit!

35:58.765 --> 36:00.201
Aah! Come here!

36:00.245 --> 36:03.204
Which... goddamn... car?

36:03.248 --> 36:04.814
I don't know.

36:08.340 --> 36:09.602
Which one?!

36:09.645 --> 36:12.518
Hello!

36:12.561 --> 36:14.128
I don't know!

36:14.172 --> 36:16.348
He don't know, Hap.

36:16.391 --> 36:20.178
We gotta search each one.
Every single one!

36:22.310 --> 36:24.138
Goddamn it.

36:24.182 --> 36:27.185
Help!

36:28.621 --> 36:30.797
Florida?

36:30.840 --> 36:32.364
Florida!

36:32.407 --> 36:34.104
Hap!

36:34.148 --> 36:35.715
Hap, is that you?

36:35.758 --> 36:37.195
Florida

36:37.238 --> 36:39.240
Florida, where are ya?!

36:39.284 --> 36:41.677
Hang on there, baby!
You in here?

36:41.721 --> 36:43.201
Hap!

36:43.244 --> 36:44.637
- Hey, over here, Hap!
- Florida!

36:44.680 --> 36:46.247
Hap, she's in here! Hey!!

36:46.291 --> 36:48.031
Florida! Yeah!

36:48.075 --> 36:51.470
- Florida!
- Hold on now! Hold on!

36:51.513 --> 36:54.037
Come on.
Florida, baby, we're comin'.

36:54.081 --> 36:55.735
One, two, three!

36:55.778 --> 36:58.825
Aah! Hap! Hap!

36:58.868 --> 37:02.611
Baby. Come on.

37:05.571 --> 37:08.661
