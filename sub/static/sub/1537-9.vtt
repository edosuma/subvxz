07:48.519 --> 07:50.253
We definitely should go
behind her back.

07:50.254 --> 07:51.287
That's the opposite side

07:51.288 --> 07:53.323
of where the germs
are coming from.

07:53.357 --> 07:56.092
Knock-knock.
Man, I...

07:56.093 --> 07:57.927
Oh, dolls! Dolls!

07:57.928 --> 07:58.928
Too many dolls!

07:58.929 --> 07:59.929
I know.

07:59.930 --> 08:03.366
I thought it would be funny,
but it's just really scary.

08:03.367 --> 08:04.868
One of them watched me bathe.

08:04.902 --> 08:06.870
Yeah, we should definitely
turn them around.

08:06.871 --> 08:08.271
Yeah.

08:08.272 --> 08:11.908
Oh, no, they have their names
written on the back.

08:11.909 --> 08:13.243
[Creepily] I'm Meredith.

08:13.244 --> 08:14.811
Will you be my mother?

08:14.812 --> 08:15.812
[Growls]

08:15.813 --> 08:17.213
[Laughing] Oh, God.

08:17.214 --> 08:18.248
Oh, okay, look.

08:18.249 --> 08:20.583
The dolls are gross, but I
think once we bury them,

08:20.584 --> 08:22.319
this place could be
kind of romantic.

08:23.587 --> 08:25.689
Yeah, totally.
Yeah.

08:25.690 --> 08:28.191
But you know what would be
even more romantic

08:28.192 --> 08:29.859
is hanging out, fully clothed,

08:29.860 --> 08:33.763
with two other people
who have fallen out of love.

08:33.764 --> 08:34.763
What did you do?

08:34.765 --> 08:36.166
[Sighs] All right, don't be mad.

08:36.167 --> 08:37.667
I invited Teddy up
to surprise Amy,

08:37.668 --> 08:39.568
but it turns out
she wants to break up with him.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.938
And now I promised her
that I would run interference,

08:41.972 --> 08:44.874
and I feel like I let you and
all of our demon children down.

08:44.909 --> 08:46.109
Oh, it's okay.

08:46.110 --> 08:47.544
You were just trying
to do something

08:47.545 --> 08:50.447
really nice for a friend,
and it blew up in your face

08:50.448 --> 08:52.248
rather spectacularly.

08:52.283 --> 08:54.317
Everything I do is spectacular.
It's a curse.

08:54.318 --> 08:55.719
Thank you
for being understanding.

08:55.753 --> 08:57.187
Yeah, well, for the record:

08:57.188 --> 08:59.622
Very cool girlfriend.
The coolest.

08:59.623 --> 09:01.358
Hey, and Teddy doesn't get here
for another 30 minutes.

09:01.359 --> 09:02.359
Till then...

09:02.360 --> 09:04.394
Let's make out?
Great plan.

09:04.428 --> 09:05.428
[Chuckles]

09:05.429 --> 09:06.529
Ah.

09:06.530 --> 09:07.597
[Sighs]

09:07.598 --> 09:08.965
Eh.

09:08.966 --> 09:09.933
<i>In the closet
where they can't watch us?</i>

09:09.967 --> 09:12.402
Yep. Smart.

09:12.403 --> 09:13.870
[Yells] Puppets!

09:13.871 --> 09:15.872
Oh, there's so many puppets
in there.

09:17.241 --> 09:18.508
Now, the first step
in learning how to cook

09:18.542 --> 09:20.677
is learning how to taste.

09:20.711 --> 09:23.346
So close your eyes
and open your mouth.

09:23.381 --> 09:25.715
This isn't burning man, Boyle.

09:25.716 --> 09:26.783
Tell me what I'm eating.

09:26.817 --> 09:28.752
Fine.
It's a sharp Vermont Cabot.

09:31.756 --> 09:33.364
Now describe what you taste.

09:34.258 --> 09:35.258
Cheese.

09:35.259 --> 09:37.961
And...

09:37.995 --> 09:39.496
Cheese.

09:39.497 --> 09:41.031
Okay.
That's good.

09:41.032 --> 09:42.766
But try being more descriptive.

09:42.800 --> 09:46.269
I know you love peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches.

09:46.303 --> 09:48.004
Why?

09:48.005 --> 09:49.673
Their components
have a long shelf life,

09:49.674 --> 09:51.574
they're cost-effective,
and they're so simple,

09:51.575 --> 09:54.010
a child could make them.

09:54.011 --> 09:57.080
Okay, I was looking for more
of an emotional connection.

09:57.114 --> 09:59.482
For example, my favorite meal

09:59.483 --> 10:02.218
is a simple roast chicken
and potatoes.

10:02.219 --> 10:04.587
It was the only dish
my mother knew how to cook,

10:04.588 --> 10:07.023
and when I eat it,
I feel as though

10:07.024 --> 10:09.192
I am once again inside her womb.

10:09.193 --> 10:11.761
What's your story behind a PB&J?

10:11.796 --> 10:13.463
I want a sandwich.

10:13.464 --> 10:14.531
I make a sandwich.

10:14.532 --> 10:17.734
I eat the sandwich.

10:18.736 --> 10:19.803
Come on, Claire!

10:19.804 --> 10:21.905
I thought you came to play.

10:21.939 --> 10:24.207
Yikes.
Where's Teddy?

10:24.208 --> 10:25.275
<i>(Amy) He's in the shower.</i>

10:25.309 --> 10:26.910
I said hi to him,
we chatted for, like,

10:26.911 --> 10:28.478
a minute, and I almost blew it.

10:28.512 --> 10:30.280
Oh, I'm sure
you're overstating that.

10:30.314 --> 10:31.781
He said he was really
looking forward

10:31.782 --> 10:35.118
to a romantic evening, and I
panicked and yelled "l-o-l."

10:35.152 --> 10:36.152
[Chuckles] Oh.

10:36.153 --> 10:37.387
Oh.

10:37.388 --> 10:38.922
I'm gonna be weird,
he's gonna ask why,

10:38.923 --> 10:40.924
we're gonna break up,
and it's gonna be super messy.

10:40.958 --> 10:42.158
Just calm down.

10:42.159 --> 10:43.159
We're gonna get you
through this, okay?

10:43.194 --> 10:44.352
<i>Here's the plan.</i>

10:44.362 --> 10:45.662
The four of us will
dine together

10:45.663 --> 10:47.063
and keep things
super unromantic.

10:47.064 --> 10:48.298
I'm great at that.
Yeah, he is.

10:48.299 --> 10:49.299
Whoo!

10:49.300 --> 10:50.834
Wait, should we have
high-fived that?

10:50.835 --> 10:52.202
I don't know.
It doesn't matter.

10:52.203 --> 10:54.170
Oh, also, if you feel like
you're losing control,

10:54.171 --> 10:57.173
just say the word "Jericho,"
and I'll pull out all the stops.

10:57.174 --> 10:59.175
Oh, Jericho.
Safe word.

10:59.176 --> 11:00.777
I love that.
Right?

11:00.811 --> 11:02.712
All right, so after dinner,
pretend you're sick

11:02.713 --> 11:03.813
and say you want to go
straight to bed.

11:03.814 --> 11:05.115
Me and you have to pick up
the perp

11:05.116 --> 11:06.916
super early in the morning,
so you only have to

11:06.917 --> 11:08.651
act normal around Teddy
from the elevator to the room.

11:08.652 --> 11:09.686
Do you think you can do that?

11:09.720 --> 11:10.987
Yes?

11:11.022 --> 11:12.355
Yes.
Say, "yes, I can do it.

11:12.356 --> 11:13.356
I can be normal."

11:13.357 --> 11:15.658
Yes, I can do it.

11:15.659 --> 11:17.394
I can be normal.
<i>There you go.</i>

11:17.395 --> 11:18.845
I can totally be normal.

11:18.863 --> 11:19.863
Hey, everybody.

11:19.864 --> 11:20.864
There he is!

11:20.865 --> 11:23.733
Teddy in the house!

11:26.720 --> 11:29.781
Who knew a prisoner transfer
could be like a vacation, huh?

11:29.782 --> 11:30.916
[Chuckles] Hey, man.

11:30.917 --> 11:31.917
Thanks a lot for telling me
to come up here.

11:31.918 --> 11:33.752
Yup, that was great of me.

11:33.786 --> 11:35.187
This place is really romantic.

11:35.221 --> 11:36.221
Mm-hmm.

11:36.256 --> 11:38.657
Uh, not that romantic, actually.

11:38.658 --> 11:41.360
The radiator in our room
sounds like a woman screaming.

11:41.394 --> 11:45.164
Yeah, oh, and there was
a dead crow in our toilet.

11:45.198 --> 11:46.632
You should complain about that.

11:46.633 --> 11:48.467
Our place is really nice.
It's got a fireplace.

11:48.468 --> 11:50.335
I'm gonna snuggle up
next to that thing with you.

11:50.370 --> 11:51.503
No, I don't want to do that.

11:51.538 --> 11:53.872
'Cause of the cancer risks.

11:53.907 --> 11:55.474
Most people don't know this,

11:55.508 --> 11:57.142
but sitting by a fire
is actually worse

11:57.143 --> 11:59.111
than sucking on a tailpipe
of a bus.

11:59.112 --> 12:00.779
Ah, because of the germs.

12:00.780 --> 12:02.014
Fumes.

12:02.015 --> 12:04.183
Oh.

12:04.217 --> 12:06.451
You know, when we first
started dating, Amy and I found

12:06.486 --> 12:08.187
this really nice B&B
up in the Poconos.

12:08.221 --> 12:09.922
We got that sweet
city employee discount.

12:09.923 --> 12:11.590
Remember that, babe?

12:11.624 --> 12:12.691
Teddy, think fast.
Drink menu.

12:12.725 --> 12:13.959
Ow.

12:13.960 --> 12:15.961
I'm sorry, man.
Chucked that right at you.

12:15.962 --> 12:17.996
I just thought
you really wanted a drink.

12:18.031 --> 12:19.331
I never need a drink menu.

12:19.332 --> 12:20.532
I got the thrills for the pils.

12:20.533 --> 12:22.468
[Chuckles]
'Cause I'm a pilsner man.

12:22.502 --> 12:23.569
Oh, I hadn't heard.

12:23.603 --> 12:25.370
That's it.

12:25.405 --> 12:26.972
I can't stop myself.

12:27.006 --> 12:28.440
Jericho. Jericho.
Jericho.

12:28.475 --> 12:29.842
[Grunts] Ow!

12:29.876 --> 12:31.643
That's pulling out
all the stops?

12:31.678 --> 12:33.045
What's going on?

12:33.046 --> 12:34.346
I want to break it up.

12:34.347 --> 12:35.346
Us.

12:35.348 --> 12:36.982
I want to break us up.

12:37.016 --> 12:38.684
Hey, folks.

12:38.685 --> 12:40.752
Welcome to the maple drip inn.

12:40.753 --> 12:42.020
Everyone excited to be here?

12:42.021 --> 12:43.989
We having a good time?

12:44.023 --> 12:46.592
We are not.

12:46.626 --> 12:48.026
All right, Gina.

12:48.061 --> 12:49.128
<i>We have to act soon.</i>

12:49.162 --> 12:50.896
That cold medicine
Diaz chugged...

12:50.897 --> 12:52.731
It was the non-drowsy kind.

12:52.765 --> 12:53.966
<i>She's all over the place.</i>

12:54.000 --> 12:56.268
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.
Guess what.

12:56.269 --> 12:58.003
I got a new lead to ask
my perp about.

12:58.004 --> 12:59.938
It's a drug dealer
on state street.

12:59.939 --> 13:00.938
[Phone ringing]

13:00.940 --> 13:01.974
Oh!

13:01.975 --> 13:04.209
Why doesn't someone
answer that phone?

13:04.210 --> 13:05.944
Get it.
I'll get it.

13:05.945 --> 13:06.945
[Flatly] Hello.

13:06.946 --> 13:08.046
No, there's no Michael here.

13:08.047 --> 13:09.481
You have the wrong number.
Good-bye.

13:09.516 --> 13:10.549
I'm Michael.

13:10.583 --> 13:11.984
That's a dumb name,
but it's yours,

13:11.985 --> 13:13.285
and you should be proud of it
because you are

13:13.286 --> 13:14.953
the greatest Detective
I've ever known.

13:14.988 --> 13:17.189
No doy, Diaz.
No doy.

13:17.223 --> 13:20.125
Where is my file?
Yeah.

13:20.126 --> 13:22.961
She's so hopped up on that
stuff, her brain's gonna blow.

13:22.962 --> 13:24.296
I'm gonna interrogate the perp.

13:24.297 --> 13:26.198
You keep Diaz occupied.

13:26.232 --> 13:28.801
I don't want to get near
her germ face.

13:28.802 --> 13:30.802
Permission to lock her
in a distant room?

13:30.837 --> 13:32.538
No.
Just distract her.

13:32.572 --> 13:35.140
Yes.
That is what I will do.

13:35.175 --> 13:37.276
Rosa, come here.

13:37.277 --> 13:39.278
Got to tell you something.
It's a secret.

13:39.312 --> 13:41.313
Okay, but I have
a lot of stuff to do.

13:41.347 --> 13:43.015
What's the secret?
What's the secret?

13:43.016 --> 13:44.015
What's the secret?

13:44.017 --> 13:45.384
Here it is. See?
Gina.

13:45.385 --> 13:46.985
Let me out of here.
I got to talk to my perp.

13:46.986 --> 13:48.086
Shh.

13:48.121 --> 13:51.523
You know, many people think
that scrambled eggs

13:51.558 --> 13:53.325
are the easiest food to make,

13:53.326 --> 13:56.428
but that is incredibly foolish.

13:56.462 --> 14:00.399
They are a highly nuanced
and complicated dish.

14:00.400 --> 14:03.535
Okay, now, go ahead
and pour your eggs

14:03.536 --> 14:07.439
right into the pan,
nice and slow.

14:07.440 --> 14:08.907
[Eggs sizzling]

14:08.908 --> 14:10.075
Oh.

14:10.109 --> 14:11.643
Okay, now what do I do?
Oh, boy.

14:11.678 --> 14:13.011
Okay, well,
you hear that sizzle?

14:13.012 --> 14:16.381
That means the heat is
a little too high on those eggs.

14:16.416 --> 14:18.450
Well, the higher the heat,
the faster the eggs cook,

14:18.451 --> 14:19.451
the sooner Kevin eats.

14:19.452 --> 14:20.451
Am I incorrect?

14:20.453 --> 14:23.021
No, you make an excellent point,

14:23.022 --> 14:25.958
but we don't want to feed Kevin
burned garbage.

14:25.992 --> 14:29.094
Cooking is about patience.

14:29.095 --> 14:31.697
Are you completely insane?

14:31.731 --> 14:34.833
You never salt can to pan.

14:34.868 --> 14:37.769
The hand...
The hand is the middle man.

14:37.804 --> 14:38.904
Okay?

14:38.905 --> 14:43.242
What you did is the culinary
equivalent of unprotected sex.

14:45.612 --> 14:47.212
You know what?

14:47.213 --> 14:51.483
You, sir, are not ready
to scramble eggs.

14:51.518 --> 14:53.285
Hand over your spatula.

14:53.319 --> 14:54.586
Fine.

14:56.389 --> 14:58.290
I only wish in return
I could get back all the time

14:58.291 --> 15:01.760
I just wasted
on this futile project.

15:01.761 --> 15:05.097
I'm just gonna make Kevin
plain toast for breakfast.

15:05.098 --> 15:07.499
Oh, that is low.

15:07.534 --> 15:09.568
Hey, Boyle.
I smell burning.

15:09.569 --> 15:11.737
Is Hitchcock roasting corn
on the radiator again?

15:11.771 --> 15:13.171
No.

15:13.172 --> 15:14.773
What you smell
is the burning wreckage

15:14.774 --> 15:16.475
of my relationship with Holt.

15:16.509 --> 15:19.077
So there's no corn on the cob?

15:19.078 --> 15:21.613
The main reason you want
to break up with me

15:21.614 --> 15:24.283
is the pilsners?

15:24.317 --> 15:25.484
I-I like other drinks.

15:25.485 --> 15:26.818
[Chuckles]

15:30.590 --> 15:31.990
It's delicious.
I want more.

15:32.025 --> 15:33.892
It's not just the pilsners.

15:33.893 --> 15:36.395
There are so many reasons
I want to break up.

15:36.429 --> 15:37.729
That sounded bad, didn't it?

15:37.730 --> 15:40.465
As a lawyer, it's my duty
to tell you to shh.

15:40.500 --> 15:42.234
Okay, look.

15:42.268 --> 15:45.938
There's just no spark
between us.

15:45.972 --> 15:47.172
That's vague.

15:47.207 --> 15:50.242
Uh, you're...
Boring.

15:50.243 --> 15:51.810
No, that's too harsh.

15:51.811 --> 15:53.612
This is why I wanted
to write it down.

15:53.646 --> 15:56.515
Can I maybe just have
two hours alone with my laptop,

15:56.516 --> 15:57.749
so I can type up a draft?

15:57.784 --> 15:58.784
Great idea.

15:58.785 --> 16:00.219
In the meantime,
we can just chat.

16:00.253 --> 16:02.054
You know what?
We should go.

16:02.088 --> 16:03.589
No, actually,
I think you should stay,

16:03.623 --> 16:05.591
so we can all talk
about the real reason

16:05.592 --> 16:07.426
there's a problem
in my relationship with Amy,

16:07.427 --> 16:08.426
which is you, Jake.

16:08.428 --> 16:10.162
Buh... what now, huh?

16:10.196 --> 16:11.763
About how you told her
that you liked her

16:11.764 --> 16:13.532
before you went undercover.

16:13.533 --> 16:15.634
You liked Amy?
Um...

16:15.668 --> 16:19.605
I did, but that was
many moons ago.

16:19.639 --> 16:20.739
Was it?

16:20.740 --> 16:22.107
'Cause I know
for a fact you also

16:22.108 --> 16:23.675
told her when you got back,
and every time you would,

16:23.676 --> 16:25.744
she would get "confused,"
and then our relationship

16:25.745 --> 16:27.346
would get "out of sync,"
and if you ask me,

16:27.347 --> 16:29.348
I think
it's because Amy liked you back.

16:30.783 --> 16:32.551
Did you?

16:32.552 --> 16:35.554
Maybe. Yes.

16:35.588 --> 16:37.956
A little.

16:37.957 --> 16:40.893
I mean, I was confused.

16:40.927 --> 16:43.462
And I really need
my laptop right now.

16:43.463 --> 16:46.164
You know what, this is
officially too much for me,

16:46.165 --> 16:48.700
so I'm gonna go upstairs and
rip the heads off some dolls.

16:48.701 --> 16:49.700
Good night.

16:49.702 --> 16:51.036
I'm gonna leave too.

16:51.070 --> 16:52.638
If you would please leave
my toothbrush

16:52.639 --> 16:54.206
and my home brewing kit
at the doorstep,

16:54.207 --> 16:56.008
I'll pick them up tomorrow.

16:56.009 --> 16:58.176
Well, I guess
that's the last time

16:58.177 --> 16:59.878

Look, I know what
that sounded like at dinner,

17:41.081 --> 17:43.582
but I promise you,
I am not into Amy.

17:43.616 --> 17:44.750
It's not what I heard, Jake.

17:44.751 --> 17:45.951
It's what I saw.

17:45.985 --> 17:47.553
You should've seen
the look on your face

17:47.554 --> 17:48.854
when you found out
Amy liked you.

17:48.855 --> 17:50.956
[Groans] Listen to me.

17:50.957 --> 17:52.991
"Liked"?
I'm an adult.

17:52.992 --> 17:55.761
All this who-likes-who stuff
sounds very High School.

I know, it's stupid.
You're totally right.

17:57.497 --> 17:59.531
But the point is, I like you.

on Amy's door.

18:03.803 --> 18:05.037
I knocked on yours.

18:05.071 --> 18:07.806
Actually, you knocked
on his door.

Oh, good morning, Captain Holt.

18:22.856 --> 18:24.757
After our disagreement
yesterday, I went online

18:24.758 --> 18:27.126
to read your culinary blogs
and scoff.

18:27.127 --> 18:29.194
To my dismay,
I actually learned something

18:29.195 --> 18:33.799
about how food tells a
story, so I made Kevin this.

18:33.800 --> 18:34.799
It's warm.

18:34.801 --> 18:35.834
It's a croque monsieur.

Kevin and I shared one on a
rainy afternoon in Paris

18:38.872 --> 18:41.273
on our first anniversary.

18:41.274 --> 18:42.841
It's one of our most
treasured memories.

18:42.876 --> 18:44.443
I'm sure it's not up
to your standards,

18:44.444 --> 18:46.812

your guidance.

minutes after I locked her in,

19:13.273 --> 19:16.241

in the past ten hours.

After I'm done crushing
that perp, you're next.

I already interrogated
the perp for you.

to lock you up.

Totally.

Sometimes you got to just
rip off the band-aid

bleed all over the place.
