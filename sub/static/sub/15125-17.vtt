WEBVTT

00:02.903 --> 00:05.473
So I was looking for my
pocket pool game in the closet

00:05.506 --> 00:06.674
and I found this.

00:06.707 --> 00:07.841
And I don't know
what game it is,

00:07.875 --> 00:09.510
but it kind of
smells like pee.

00:09.543 --> 00:11.212
That's 'cause I peed on it.
Aah!

00:11.245 --> 00:12.980
Why would you pee
on a video game?

00:13.013 --> 00:15.216
Jimmy, it's not a video game.

00:15.249 --> 00:16.184
(laughs)

00:16.217 --> 00:18.419
This is my ovulation kit.

00:18.452 --> 00:20.754
I used to use it with Wyatt,
so I could make extra sure

00:20.788 --> 00:21.855
I wouldn't get pregnant.

00:21.889 --> 00:23.657
So... why do you
still have it?

00:23.691 --> 00:25.159
Because the pharmacy
has a very firm

00:25.193 --> 00:26.860
"once peed on,
no return" policy.

00:26.894 --> 00:28.696
But you're not still
using it, right?

00:28.729 --> 00:30.231
No, no, no.
Of course not.

00:30.264 --> 00:31.432
I feel like, if we got
accidentally pregnant,

00:31.465 --> 00:32.700
that'd be great, right?

00:32.733 --> 00:35.136
Why would it have
to be accidentally?

00:36.937 --> 00:38.439
Are you saying what
I think you're saying?

00:38.472 --> 00:40.708
I'm not... not saying
what you think I'm saying.

00:40.741 --> 00:43.544
Well, I'm not not
loving what I'm hearing.

00:43.577 --> 00:44.878
I'm not sure
that I'm following

00:44.912 --> 00:46.514
what you're not not loving.

00:46.547 --> 00:49.717
I'm loving the idea
of having a baby.

00:49.750 --> 00:50.784
Me, too.

00:50.818 --> 00:53.053
Let's not not do this thing.

00:53.087 --> 00:54.755
(laughs)
Uh, now...

00:54.788 --> 00:56.857
which end of this thing
do I pee on?

00:56.890 --> 00:58.426
Yuck.

00:59.793 --> 01:01.395
* Whoo!

01:01.429 --> 01:06.066
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh! *

01:08.169 --> 01:10.304
Aw, you guys can't
eat all this junk.

01:10.338 --> 01:11.439
It'll kill you.

01:11.472 --> 01:12.440
We need the energy.

01:12.473 --> 01:13.974
It's planting season,

01:14.007 --> 01:15.709
and I'm laying down
fertilizer ten hours a day.

01:15.743 --> 01:17.478
Planting season means
all the part-time maids are

01:17.511 --> 01:19.213
taking off for
higher paying farm work,

01:19.247 --> 01:20.648
so I'm working
double shifts.

01:20.681 --> 01:22.283
This is all that
gets us through the day.

01:22.316 --> 01:23.751
VIRGINIA: The energy drinks
they sell in stores

01:23.784 --> 01:25.586
aren't strong enough,
so we make our own.

01:25.619 --> 01:27.555
BURT:
We call them cola-chinos.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.823
*

01:29.857 --> 01:32.660
I know it sounds kind of gross,
but with a little sugar,

01:32.693 --> 01:35.163
tastes kind of good.

01:37.631 --> 01:38.799
(screams)

01:38.832 --> 01:41.802
* Pour some sugar on me...

01:41.835 --> 01:43.771
VIRGINIA:
Since the news told us

01:43.804 --> 01:45.473
energy bars are really
just candy bars

01:45.506 --> 01:47.841
in fancy wrappers,
we came up with our own idea.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.910
BURT: The sugar-burger--
really gives us the extra pep

01:49.943 --> 01:51.479
we need to get through the day.

01:51.512 --> 01:52.846
(moans)

01:52.880 --> 01:55.249
* Pour some sugar on me...

01:55.283 --> 01:56.684
My skin is electric!

01:56.717 --> 01:58.452
* Ooh, in the name of love

01:58.486 --> 02:02.156
* Pour some sugar on me

02:02.190 --> 02:03.991
* Come on, fire me up

02:04.024 --> 02:05.493
* Pour your sugar...

02:05.526 --> 02:08.128
(car horn blaring)

02:08.162 --> 02:10.331
VIRGINIA: Unfortunately,
if you don't keep eating it,

02:10.364 --> 02:12.466
you crash pretty hard.

02:14.168 --> 02:16.804
* Sugar me.

02:17.638 --> 02:18.872
You're stress eating.

02:18.906 --> 02:21.275
What you need is
to get away and relax.

02:21.309 --> 02:23.110
We could never afford
to do that.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.978
I'm going on a retreat
this weekend.

02:25.012 --> 02:27.215
It's all-you-can-eat-and-drink,
has beautiful scenery,

02:27.248 --> 02:28.482
and it's free.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.451
What's the catch?

02:30.484 --> 02:31.785
No catch.
All you have to do is

02:31.819 --> 02:32.853
sit through
a short presentation.

02:32.886 --> 02:34.488
(gasps)
We love those!

02:34.522 --> 02:36.890
We've fallen for
several pyramid schemes.

02:36.924 --> 02:39.493
Plus, we had a fun two months
as Scientologists.

02:39.527 --> 02:41.695
I don't know. I think...

02:41.729 --> 02:43.397
(groaning)

02:44.998 --> 02:47.401
Sorry, my pancreas seized up.

02:47.435 --> 02:49.870
I should probably
go to urgent care,

02:49.903 --> 02:51.405
but your vacation
sounds more fun.

02:51.439 --> 02:54.041
(groaning)

02:55.909 --> 02:59.547
Hope is down for her nap,
so let the baby-making begin.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.649
Here, drink this.

03:01.682 --> 03:04.184
It's called conceivabili-tea.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.522
Oh, God, that's awful.

03:08.556 --> 03:10.224
Why are we drinking
this stuff?

03:10.258 --> 03:12.926
It's supposed to activate
all of our fertility channels.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.061
Why don't we just
get drunk and do it

03:14.094 --> 03:15.363
in the back of the car?

03:15.396 --> 03:16.430
That's how everybody
I know gets pregnant.

03:16.464 --> 03:18.198
I'm ovulating right now.

03:18.232 --> 03:20.200
We only have 72 hours
to make this baby,

03:20.234 --> 03:21.535
and I-I want to
do it right.

03:21.569 --> 03:24.272
So does that still
involve me and sex?

03:24.305 --> 03:25.906
(doorbell rings)

03:26.807 --> 03:28.041
Maw Maw?

03:28.075 --> 03:29.009
What are you doing here?

03:29.042 --> 03:30.711
It's all in the note.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.082
VIRGINIA (speaking slowly):
Jimmy...

03:35.115 --> 03:37.184
We... knew...

03:37.217 --> 03:41.289
you... wouldn't...

03:41.322 --> 03:43.757
Hey, let me see that.

03:43.791 --> 03:45.526
VIRGINIA (normal voice):
Jimmy, we knew you wouldn't
say yes to this,

03:45.559 --> 03:47.094
but we need you to watch
Maw Maw for a few days

03:47.127 --> 03:48.696
while we go on
a relaxing vacation.

03:48.729 --> 03:49.930
You can say no,
but she will surely die,

03:49.963 --> 03:51.532
and it will be all your fault.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.200
(sighs) Your parents just
ditched us with Maw Maw.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.736
Don't act like
I'm such a burden.

03:55.769 --> 03:58.772
I may be old, but I can
take care of myself.

03:58.806 --> 04:00.240
Uh...

04:00.274 --> 04:02.242
(sighs)

04:02.276 --> 04:04.144
Well, if Maw Maw's
gonna be here,

04:04.177 --> 04:05.446
maybe we should just
wait until next week

04:05.479 --> 04:06.980
to start the whole
baby thing.

04:07.014 --> 04:08.549
No, Jimmy!

04:08.582 --> 04:10.050
Look, if we don't get pregnant
in the next three days,

04:10.083 --> 04:11.285
then we got to wait
another year.

04:11.319 --> 04:12.953
My lady eggs are
all dressed up

04:12.986 --> 04:14.622
and ready to go
to the ball right now.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.156
A year?

04:16.189 --> 04:18.091
I thought your eggs
hatched every month.
Well...

04:18.125 --> 04:19.993
The female body
is such a mystery to me.

04:20.027 --> 04:21.429
I know it is, Jimmy.

04:21.462 --> 04:22.630
MAW MAW: I can't open
any of these cabinets.

04:22.663 --> 04:25.132
That's 'cause
they're child-proofed.

04:25.165 --> 04:26.667
If we get pregnant now,

04:26.700 --> 04:28.802
then our baby
will be born in November.

04:28.836 --> 04:30.804
Just trust me 'cause
I've looked at a calendar.

04:30.838 --> 04:32.573
There have been
countless studies

04:32.606 --> 04:34.508
that show that all of
the most successful babies

04:34.542 --> 04:35.976
have been born in November.

04:36.009 --> 04:38.278
Because they're
the oldest in their class.

04:38.312 --> 04:40.080
One reason I support
your theory

04:40.113 --> 04:41.982
is that it means we can
have sex right now.

04:42.015 --> 04:43.984
(clattering)
MAW MAW:
This house sucks!

04:44.017 --> 04:46.520
Maybe we should just go do this
at your parents' house.

04:46.554 --> 04:47.688
We might be better off

04:47.721 --> 04:49.122
dealing with Maw Maw
on her own turf.

04:49.156 --> 04:50.458
It'll be fine.

04:51.892 --> 04:54.261
Apparently you two rocket
scientists insist on

04:54.294 --> 04:55.663
child-proofing your toilet,

04:55.696 --> 04:58.666
so you're going to need
to buy a new hamper.

05:00.401 --> 05:01.935
This place is
so luxurious.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.337
I just got back
from the bathroom;

05:03.371 --> 05:04.705
the stalls are huge.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.674
I can finally do my
business starfish-style.

05:06.707 --> 05:08.709
I love these
big comfy chairs.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.043
Feel like I'm on Oprah.

05:10.077 --> 05:11.379
Oh.

05:11.412 --> 05:13.614
(laughs)
Ladies and gentlemen,

05:13.647 --> 05:17.485
I'm Shelby Hornsby,
founder of Handles.

05:17.518 --> 05:20.287
And yes,
I used to have them.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.690
Until those handles
opened a door

05:22.723 --> 05:25.125
that led me to
a healthy lifestyle.

05:25.158 --> 05:28.328
(whispering): Oh, my God,
Burt, everyone here is huge.

05:28.362 --> 05:29.997
Barney brought us
to a fat camp.

05:32.065 --> 05:34.502
SHELBY:
...just like it was for one of

05:34.535 --> 05:38.806
our biggest and now littlest
success stories:

05:38.839 --> 05:40.173
Barney Hughes!

05:45.078 --> 05:48.416
You may not believe it,
but this tight set of buns

05:48.449 --> 05:51.218
was once able to fill out these.

05:51.251 --> 05:52.720
Whoa.

05:52.753 --> 05:54.488
And recently, I helped
two other people achieve

05:54.522 --> 05:56.624
the same amazing results.

05:58.726 --> 06:00.327
That's us.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.729
He computerized us
into fat people.

06:01.762 --> 06:03.363
And there's the catch.

06:03.397 --> 06:06.500
Virginia and Burt Chance,
stand up and take a bow.

06:06.534 --> 06:08.536
Two things you couldn't do
six months ago.

06:08.569 --> 06:10.938
(applause)

06:20.481 --> 06:21.882
Oh, thank you,

06:21.915 --> 06:23.451
but Virginia and Burt
are the real heroes.

06:23.484 --> 06:24.618
VIRGINIA:
Barney...

06:24.652 --> 06:26.854
what the hell's going on?

06:26.887 --> 06:28.522
Why'd you lie
about us being fat?

06:28.556 --> 06:30.290
I'm sorry I lied,

06:30.323 --> 06:32.225
but I needed to tell people that
I inspired you to lose weight,

06:32.259 --> 06:33.461
so I could get my pants on

06:33.494 --> 06:35.028
the Wall of
Quadruple Excellence.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.096
The what?

06:37.130 --> 06:38.866
Whoa.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.768
Oh, my God.
I thought those were kites.

06:40.801 --> 06:43.604
It's where Handles honors
their most inspirational alumni.

06:43.637 --> 06:45.272
And it's always been
my dream to be up there,

06:45.305 --> 06:47.207
but I've never been
able to inspire anybody.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.876
That's not true, Barney.

06:48.909 --> 06:52.045
Whenever I'm having a hard day,
I think, "Look at Barney.

06:52.079 --> 06:55.716
"Dead-end job,
no wife, bleak future,

06:55.749 --> 06:58.385
"and that poor bastard always
has a smile on his face.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.753
What do I have to
complain about?"

06:59.787 --> 07:01.288
Thanks, Burt.

07:01.321 --> 07:03.123
So will you help me?

07:03.156 --> 07:05.158
I don't know. I don't want
to give all these campers

07:05.192 --> 07:07.495
false hope that they can
have all this.

07:07.528 --> 07:10.598
I mean, it's taken years
of cigarettes, being poor

07:10.631 --> 07:13.000
and manual labor to achieve
these hot bods.
Yeah.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.301
MAN:
Hey, excuse me.

07:14.334 --> 07:15.803
We've been coming
here for years,

07:15.836 --> 07:17.270
and for the first time
we were able to see

07:17.304 --> 07:19.139
your amazing
results firsthand.

07:19.172 --> 07:20.240
Because of you,

07:20.273 --> 07:21.775
we're gonna stop living a lie.

07:35.823 --> 07:38.291
I don't know, Virginia.

07:38.325 --> 07:40.193
It might be kind of cool.

07:40.227 --> 07:43.130
We could be fake inspirations
to people, like Lance Armstrong.

07:43.163 --> 07:44.698
Anyone with the confidence

07:44.732 --> 07:46.800
to wear biker shorts
with one ball is okay with me.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.502
Okay, Barney, we're in.

07:48.536 --> 07:50.337
*

07:50.370 --> 07:54.474
Okay, so I've lit the candles,
classical music is playing.

07:54.508 --> 07:56.143
Now, can you please
explain to me

07:56.176 --> 07:58.178
why you're standing
on your hands?

07:58.211 --> 08:00.313
Well, I read on several
online baby blogs

08:00.347 --> 08:04.151
that this helps get the smartest
eggs in the, uh, prime position.

08:04.184 --> 08:05.786
If you could maybe just
help me over to the bed.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.421
(sighs)
Okay.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.501
(laughs, sighs)

08:21.535 --> 08:22.870
You okay?

08:22.903 --> 08:25.172
That's all right,
I'm okay, just maybe...

08:25.205 --> 08:26.740
let's just close our eyes

08:26.774 --> 08:29.209
and just think of something
really beautiful, huh?

08:29.242 --> 08:31.645
What do you see?
Maw Maw.

08:31.679 --> 08:33.581
Whatever works for you,
Jimmy, that's fine.

08:33.614 --> 08:35.583
Maw Maw's here watching us.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.250
Oh, God.

08:37.284 --> 08:41.154
It's not dinner and a show
unless the show actually starts.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.923
Hey, isn't it bedtime, Maw Maw?

08:42.956 --> 08:44.858
No, it's pickle-time.

08:44.892 --> 08:47.027
You've been out of
the house for too long.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.496
Damn, I totally forgot
about pickle-time.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.865
She sleeps all day and when
she wakes up, she eats pickles

08:51.899 --> 08:53.901
for three hours and annoys
the hell out of everyone else.

08:53.934 --> 08:55.836
That's the plan.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.371
(sighs)
Okay.

08:58.405 --> 08:59.907
I know it's not perfect.

08:59.940 --> 09:02.910
Maybe we should just start
where we left off, huh?

09:02.943 --> 09:05.613
Okay, so deep breaths.

09:05.646 --> 09:06.680
(inhales deeply)

09:06.714 --> 09:08.015
Oh, yeah.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.783
Why does the bathroom
smell like pickles?

09:09.817 --> 09:11.051
Huh?

09:12.753 --> 09:13.954
How does she do that?

09:13.987 --> 09:17.024
A magician never
reveals her tricks.

09:17.057 --> 09:20.093
Also, I have no idea
how I got here.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.365
Boy, shaking hands
and looking thin

09:25.398 --> 09:26.967
really works up an appetite.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.302
I know. I've been hungry
since the morning weigh-in.

09:29.336 --> 09:31.471
I've never seen a scale
with a seat before.

09:31.504 --> 09:33.774
All right, guys, remember,
everyone's gonna be watching

09:33.807 --> 09:35.575
to see what you're eating,
so don't go crazy.

09:35.609 --> 09:38.211
Got it. Small portions.

09:38.245 --> 09:40.714
Thin slice of pie,
nothing a la mode.

09:40.748 --> 09:42.249
So, this is the salad bar.

09:42.282 --> 09:43.583
Where's the rest of
the all-you-can-eat buffet?

09:43.617 --> 09:45.085
It's an
all-you-should-eat buffet.

09:45.118 --> 09:47.587
All the food options
are healthy, and the plates

09:47.621 --> 09:50.323
are specially designed
for portion control.

09:50.357 --> 09:52.459
So it's crappy food
that we only get a little of?

09:52.492 --> 09:53.727
Barney, this isn't food.

09:53.761 --> 09:55.629
This is the food
they feed to your food

09:55.663 --> 09:56.897
before they feed it to you.

09:56.930 --> 09:57.931
Guys, please.

09:57.965 --> 09:59.299
Everyone's watching.

09:59.332 --> 10:01.601
You're the "afters"
to all their "befores."

10:01.635 --> 10:03.103
At this place,
you're the heroes.

10:03.136 --> 10:04.604
I don't know, Barney.

10:04.638 --> 10:05.973
I mean, yes,
we're the only ones here

10:06.006 --> 10:07.440
who would look good in tights,

10:07.474 --> 10:09.743
but that doesn't make us heroes.
Are you kidding?

10:09.777 --> 10:12.980
These people would follow you
to the ends of the earth.

10:13.013 --> 10:15.548
Barring a steep incline
or any big jump in humidity.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.021
Mmm, wow.

10:21.054 --> 10:22.990
I don't know why
they call this roughage

10:23.023 --> 10:25.125
when it goes down so smooth.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.598
(sighs) We haven't even
started this thing

10:31.631 --> 10:33.801
and I've got sweat
pouring out of every pit,

10:33.834 --> 10:35.202
crack and skin fold.

10:35.235 --> 10:36.636
Ah, you're fine.

10:36.670 --> 10:37.971
This is just what it feels like
to be healthy.

10:38.005 --> 10:40.173
No wonder vegans
are such jerks.

10:40.207 --> 10:41.341
Okay, it's time to start.

10:41.374 --> 10:42.442
Now, remember,

10:42.475 --> 10:43.643
every dream I've ever dreamed

10:43.677 --> 10:44.845
hinges on your performance.

10:44.878 --> 10:45.946
No pressure.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.280
Go!

10:47.314 --> 10:48.515
(blows whistle)

10:48.548 --> 10:50.617
(Virginia and Burt scream)

10:50.650 --> 10:53.586
*

11:00.560 --> 11:02.863
* My name is yum yum
gimme some *

11:02.896 --> 11:04.998
* My name is
yum yum gimme some *

11:05.032 --> 11:07.334
* My name is yum yum
gimme some *

11:07.367 --> 11:09.569
* My name is
yum yum gimme some... *

11:13.006 --> 11:15.475
(high-pitched gasping)

11:15.508 --> 11:17.677
(panting)

11:22.750 --> 11:24.451
(cheering, applause)

11:29.089 --> 11:30.690
Oh, that was pathetic.

11:30.724 --> 11:31.859
Are you two okay?

11:31.892 --> 11:32.926
We're fine.

11:32.960 --> 11:33.927
We're just
stretching.

11:33.961 --> 11:35.362
(wheezing):
Our lungs.

11:35.395 --> 11:36.396
Oh, my God.

11:36.429 --> 11:37.564
You guys are in worse shape

11:37.597 --> 11:38.732
than I thought.

11:39.599 --> 11:41.101
I'm so itchy.

11:41.134 --> 11:42.435
I know. Me, too.

11:42.469 --> 11:45.072
Feels like I got gummy
worms under my skin.

11:45.105 --> 11:46.940
No, don't worry.
You're gonna be fine.

11:46.974 --> 11:48.708
We're here.

11:48.742 --> 11:50.744
The contraband room.

11:50.778 --> 11:52.746
While most Handles campers
come with open hearts,

11:52.780 --> 11:54.547
many also come
with hidden pockets

11:54.581 --> 11:56.850
filled with sugar, fat and salt,
all of which ends up here.

11:56.884 --> 11:58.118
Enough talk, Barney!

11:58.151 --> 12:00.287
Yeah, let us in.

12:01.154 --> 12:02.790
These are just sponges.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.958
These cakes smell
like urinal cakes.

12:04.992 --> 12:07.394
Cake is cake.
Give me that!

12:09.096 --> 12:10.630
I'm doing this
for your own good.

12:10.663 --> 12:12.299
Barney!

12:12.332 --> 12:13.801
What the fudge?!

12:13.834 --> 12:15.803
Oh, how good would fudge be
right now?

12:15.836 --> 12:17.137
Hey, hey.

12:20.673 --> 12:22.309
(high-pitched yelling)
(whimpering)

12:22.342 --> 12:23.944
Let us out!

12:23.977 --> 12:26.814
No. I spent nine hours
altering those photos,

12:26.847 --> 12:28.281
and I brought
you two up here

12:28.315 --> 12:29.749
in the hopes of changing
some peoples' lives.

12:29.783 --> 12:31.284
But seeing the condition
you're in,

12:31.318 --> 12:33.086
I realize it's your lives
that need changing.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.122
We don't need changing, Barney!

12:35.155 --> 12:37.224
Look at us.
We're beautiful.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.959
Every woman in this place
would kill

12:38.992 --> 12:41.895
for Virginia's breasts
or her thighs or her wings.

12:41.929 --> 12:43.430
Oh, my God,
I'm hungry!

12:43.463 --> 12:45.098
Oh, you're going through
junk food withdrawal.

12:45.132 --> 12:46.566
You look terrible!

12:46.599 --> 12:48.568
That's just another one
of your fat camp lies.

12:48.601 --> 12:49.769
Get us a mirror.

12:49.803 --> 12:51.438
Handles doesn't
have any mirrors.

12:51.471 --> 12:53.573
Ever since a guest shattered
one and used the shards

12:53.606 --> 12:54.975
to kill and eat a raccoon.

12:55.008 --> 12:57.410
Oh, how good would raccoon be
right now?

12:57.444 --> 13:00.613
Trust me, I'm doing
this for your own good.

13:00.647 --> 13:02.315
No, no. No, no, no.
No! No!

13:02.349 --> 13:03.483
Barney!

13:03.516 --> 13:04.784
(both yelling)

13:04.818 --> 13:06.954
Ooh!

13:08.055 --> 13:09.990
Maybe we can eat these.

13:10.023 --> 13:13.193
How different can a packing
peanut be from a circus peanut?

13:13.226 --> 13:14.361
Oh, my God.

13:14.394 --> 13:15.829
So different.

13:15.863 --> 13:17.530
Maybe there's some sugar
in this glass cleaner.

13:17.564 --> 13:18.999
MAN:
I wouldn't do that.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.633
It tastes terrible.

13:20.667 --> 13:22.469
What the hell?
Shh.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.671
(whispers):
Is there somebody in here?

13:32.913 --> 13:34.314
Who are you?

13:34.347 --> 13:37.017
Kevin. They caught me
smuggling candy bars,

13:37.050 --> 13:38.351
and they locked me in here.

13:38.385 --> 13:39.853
Well, there's got
to be a way out.

13:39.887 --> 13:40.988
There is a way,

13:41.021 --> 13:42.689
but it's impossible.

13:42.722 --> 13:43.790
You have to walk up

13:43.823 --> 13:45.392
two flights of stairs,

13:45.425 --> 13:48.128
and then somehow scale
a four-foot chain-link fence.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.863
Then, if you manage
to get over that,

13:49.897 --> 13:51.965
well, it's still half a mile

13:51.999 --> 13:55.402
of only partially-shaded road
until the nearest town.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.337
None of that sounds
that difficult.

13:57.370 --> 14:00.007
Well, I guess if you're
a superhero or something.

14:00.040 --> 14:03.043
So, there's no lasers
or fields of landmines?

14:03.076 --> 14:04.377
Don't need 'em.

14:04.411 --> 14:06.046
There's a window
behind that shelf,

14:06.079 --> 14:08.015
but you'll never get through it.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.154
Why?

14:14.187 --> 14:15.822
Is it bolted or locked?

14:15.855 --> 14:16.990
Painted shut?

14:17.024 --> 14:19.192
Is it...?

14:21.261 --> 14:23.863
(laughs)

14:24.764 --> 14:26.766
Come on, Kevin.
Come with...

14:27.901 --> 14:30.070
Where is he?

14:30.103 --> 14:31.571
What's weirder?

14:31.604 --> 14:33.840
We both hallucinated the
same overweight friend,

14:33.873 --> 14:37.110
or a mop told us how to
get out of this room?

14:37.144 --> 14:38.778
BURT:
I don't care.

14:38.811 --> 14:39.980
We're out.

14:41.114 --> 14:42.916
*

14:42.950 --> 14:44.584
Oh.

14:44.617 --> 14:46.553
Hey.

14:46.586 --> 14:47.554
(gulps)

14:47.587 --> 14:48.888
Finally.

14:48.922 --> 14:51.024
Now let's get started
on Little Jimmy.

14:51.058 --> 14:52.259
Doesn't really help
my confidence

14:52.292 --> 14:53.393
when you call it "Little Jimmy."

14:53.426 --> 14:54.761
Oh. Oh, no, no, no.

14:54.794 --> 14:56.296
I was just talking
about our future son.

14:56.329 --> 14:57.864
(doorbell rings)

14:57.897 --> 14:59.632
(knocking)

15:01.901 --> 15:03.971
Whoa! Jimmy.

15:04.004 --> 15:05.538
Weird seeing you here.

15:05.572 --> 15:08.308
Weirder than going out
in a man-sized onesie?

15:08.341 --> 15:09.977
My house got robbed.

15:10.010 --> 15:12.145
I couldn't stay there,
so I quickly changed

15:12.179 --> 15:14.414
into my jammies
and grabbed my go bag.

15:14.447 --> 15:16.549
But why would
you come here?

15:16.583 --> 15:19.586
I always come here
when I'm scared at night.

15:19.619 --> 15:21.121
Okay, you know what?
That's fine.

15:21.154 --> 15:23.223
You can stay
here, but

15:23.256 --> 15:25.292
we are gonna be in the bedroom.
Please don't bother us.

15:25.325 --> 15:26.426
We'll see you
in the morning.

15:26.459 --> 15:29.329
You won't even know I'm here.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.765
Now... where were we?

15:33.833 --> 15:35.868
(Frank screaming,
Sabrina shrieks)

15:38.938 --> 15:41.408
Whoa. Are you okay?

15:41.441 --> 15:43.176
Oh, you heard that?

15:43.210 --> 15:45.145
Yeah, we did.
What are you doing?

15:45.178 --> 15:47.114
You're gonna wake up
Hope and Maw Maw,

15:47.147 --> 15:48.815
and it took us all day
to put them down.

15:48.848 --> 15:51.918
I forgot to mention I have
stress-induced night terrors.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.153
Oh.

15:53.186 --> 15:55.288
Burt usually rocks
me back to sleep.

15:55.322 --> 15:56.589
With his guitar?

15:56.623 --> 15:57.757
With his arms.

15:57.790 --> 15:58.791
(sighs)

15:58.825 --> 16:00.093
For a man who works outdoors,

16:00.127 --> 16:01.628
he has a surprisingly
gentle embrace.

16:01.661 --> 16:04.631
Okay. Fine.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.001
Yeah.

16:08.035 --> 16:11.204
Yeah. Okay.

16:11.238 --> 16:13.173
Hopefully,
he'll fall asleep soon,

16:13.206 --> 16:17.010
and then I can go back to bed
and, you know, join you.

16:17.044 --> 16:18.611
Hopefully, by then,

16:18.645 --> 16:20.113
I will have completely erased
this image from my brain.

16:20.147 --> 16:22.949
Sabrina, I'm trying
to sleep here.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.817
Would you mind...?
Shh.

16:24.851 --> 16:27.287
And, Jimmy,

16:27.320 --> 16:30.790
it wouldn't hurt if you put on
a little of your dad's cologne.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.526
Shh. Shh.

16:48.375 --> 16:49.576
(yelling)

16:49.609 --> 16:50.843
Oh. Oh.

16:50.877 --> 16:52.312
Shh. Shh.

16:52.345 --> 16:55.182
Oh, I can't wait
to eat some

16:55.215 --> 16:59.252
good food sold to me by a clown,
a king or a plantation owner.

16:59.286 --> 17:01.054
But we don't have any money.

17:01.088 --> 17:03.890
I don't want to sell my body
for nuggets, but I will.

17:03.923 --> 17:05.692
(Burt sniffs)

17:05.725 --> 17:08.161
Do you smell that?
Is it? Could it be?

17:08.195 --> 17:10.530
Oh.
We're gonna live!

17:12.232 --> 17:13.500
Hey.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.702
(panting)

17:19.072 --> 17:20.440
(grunting)

17:20.473 --> 17:22.008
French fries!

17:22.041 --> 17:24.444
Get in the minivan, kids.
Get in the minivan now!

17:24.477 --> 17:25.612
(grunts)

17:27.414 --> 17:28.848
(both grunting)

17:28.881 --> 17:31.251
GIRL: Zombies!
Go, go, go!

17:31.284 --> 17:32.719
Help! They're
gonna eat us!

17:32.752 --> 17:33.920
(muttering, moaning)

17:33.953 --> 17:36.589
(people screaming)

17:36.623 --> 17:38.791
I don't think this is
working out for us.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.393
That's okay.

17:40.427 --> 17:42.462
I got a better plan.

17:43.763 --> 17:46.233
I used to do this
when Hope was a little baby.

17:46.266 --> 17:49.569
It's called a
"baby burrito."

17:49.602 --> 17:50.637
Yeah, I remember.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.205
Seeing what a
good father

17:52.239 --> 17:55.007
you were is what made me
fall in love with you.

17:56.609 --> 17:59.812
We still got 15 minutes left
in my little baby egg window.

17:59.846 --> 18:01.514
Let's go.
(laughs)

18:02.515 --> 18:04.484
SABRINA (laughing):
Oh.

18:04.517 --> 18:06.419
(phone ringing)
HOPE:
Mommy! Daddy!

18:06.453 --> 18:08.555
MAW MAW:
Oh, God, I'm blind!

18:08.588 --> 18:10.723
Wait. Is it night?

18:10.757 --> 18:12.659
(Frank screaming,
phone continues ringing)

18:12.692 --> 18:14.327
(crying)
HOPE:
Daddy?

18:14.361 --> 18:16.429
No reason to ignore
the phone now. (sighs)

18:16.463 --> 18:18.965
(Sabrina sputters,
Frank continues screaming)

18:18.998 --> 18:20.167
Hello?

18:20.200 --> 18:22.335
You're where?!

18:22.369 --> 18:24.003
Jail. We're in jail.

18:24.036 --> 18:26.139
Bring bail money
and anything in the kitchen

18:26.173 --> 18:28.241
with "high fructose
corn syrup" on the label.

18:28.275 --> 18:30.377
The higher the better!
Yeah, higher the better.

18:34.046 --> 18:35.648
(garbled radio transmission)

18:35.682 --> 18:37.484
Now, you guys sit here and
behave; and so we don't have

18:37.517 --> 18:38.985
a repeat of the whole
why-are-you-hitting-yourself

18:39.018 --> 18:41.321
incident from the car,
Hope's in charge.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.091
Now,

18:45.124 --> 18:46.326
what'd you guys do?

18:46.359 --> 18:48.027
It's all Barney's fault.

18:50.563 --> 18:51.864
Oh, Virginia!

18:51.898 --> 18:53.666
Envelopes!

18:53.700 --> 18:55.034
Unlicked!

18:55.067 --> 18:56.836
Jackpot!

18:57.670 --> 18:59.472
Ah, there you two are.

18:59.506 --> 19:01.140
(grunting)
Stay back!

19:01.174 --> 19:02.475
We're not going
back there, Barney!

19:02.509 --> 19:04.944
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm-I'm friendly.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.946
Look.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.748
Ooh...

19:11.218 --> 19:13.386
It's okay, fella.

19:16.589 --> 19:19.559
Mmm, mmm.

19:19.592 --> 19:21.060
You guys, I am so sorry.

19:21.093 --> 19:23.029
I got so caught up
in getting my pants

19:23.062 --> 19:24.831
on the Wall of
Quadruple Excellence

19:24.864 --> 19:26.833
that I lost sight of what it
means to be truly inspirational.

19:26.866 --> 19:28.968
You two don't have the same
issues with food that I do,

19:29.001 --> 19:30.403
and to think
that locking you in a cage

19:30.437 --> 19:31.571
would do you any good was wrong.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.206
It's gonna take a lot more

19:33.240 --> 19:35.342
than a couple sugar cubes to
get us to forgive you, Barney.

19:35.375 --> 19:38.245
I know.
That's why I brought this.

19:38.278 --> 19:40.012
Oh.

19:40.046 --> 19:41.348
(shrieks)

19:41.381 --> 19:42.682
He's got the good stuff!

19:42.715 --> 19:43.916
We love you,
Barney!

19:43.950 --> 19:45.918
(siren whoops)

19:45.952 --> 19:48.388
MAN (over bullhorn):
Freeze, junkie scum!

19:50.790 --> 19:53.726
Turns out, all that stuff
was real candy,

19:53.760 --> 19:55.362
which you were eating
in a Dumpster.

19:55.395 --> 19:57.264
So the only thing
you're guilty of is being

19:57.297 --> 20:00.633
gross, disgusting people
who probably have hepatitis C.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.570
Please leave this police station

20:03.603 --> 20:05.405
and try not to touch anything
on your way out.

20:13.480 --> 20:16.048
These are for everybody, right?

20:19.085 --> 20:21.588
Are we there yet?
Not that I have

20:21.621 --> 20:23.290
the faintest clue
where we're going.

20:23.323 --> 20:25.592
We're almost home, Maw Maw.
Just go to sleep, okay?

20:25.625 --> 20:26.759
(snoring)

20:26.793 --> 20:28.361
I'm sorry about this.

20:28.395 --> 20:31.063
I guess we missed
our 72-hour window.

20:31.097 --> 20:32.732
Honey, there's gonna be
other windows.

20:32.765 --> 20:35.034
And, like, it's really
not the worst thing in the world

20:35.067 --> 20:37.036
that we have to wait
another year, right?

20:37.069 --> 20:39.306
I'm not bummed about it
if you're not bummed about it.

20:39.339 --> 20:41.073
Oh, baby, I'm not bummed.

20:41.107 --> 20:44.477
Plus, it's like, we already got
the greatest kid in the world.

20:44.511 --> 20:47.079
I guess we just
enjoy being parents to Hope

20:47.113 --> 20:49.916
and wait until
the time is right.

20:49.949 --> 20:53.320
Yeah, and, you know, like,
I'm not not into practicing

20:53.353 --> 20:56.255
as much as we possibly can
until that time comes.

20:56.289 --> 20:58.425
So, do you want
to go to the pharmacy

20:58.458 --> 20:59.826
and not not pick up condoms?

20:59.859 --> 21:01.461
I don't not not want to do that.

21:01.494 --> 21:04.331
You guys are not not
grossing me out.

21:04.364 --> 21:05.732
JIMMY:
Barney didn't get his pants

21:05.765 --> 21:07.066
on the Wall Of Excellence,

21:07.099 --> 21:08.735
but he did find
a place for them

21:08.768 --> 21:10.236
where they could do some good.

21:10.269 --> 21:11.604
Even though Barney
lied to us,

21:11.638 --> 21:13.773
I'm still glad
we went to Handles.
Me, too.

21:13.806 --> 21:16.409
The detox was hard,
but now that we're past it,

21:16.443 --> 21:18.678
I'm really glad we're making
smarter food choices.

21:18.711 --> 21:20.613
Like these apples.

21:20.647 --> 21:22.014
What does "GMO" stand for?

21:22.048 --> 21:25.017
Oh. "God Made Organic"?

21:25.051 --> 21:26.653
Probably.

21:26.686 --> 21:29.689
And these apples are
made with 70% synthetic corn.

21:29.722 --> 21:31.123
Now, that's got to be healthy.

21:33.993 --> 21:35.362
(boat horn honks)

21:35.395 --> 21:37.296
MAN:
Last looks.

21:37.330 --> 21:39.732
