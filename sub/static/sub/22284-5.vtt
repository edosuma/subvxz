And where's your shirt?

13:25.763 --> 13:27.723
lt's. . . lt's in the dryer, Craig.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.309
How stupid do you think l am?
Are you sleeping with him?

13:30.393 --> 13:33.061
How dare you ask me that?
l am looking out for our future.

13:33.229 --> 13:35.689
What does my future have to do
with this dude with no shirt on?

13:35.940 --> 13:38.400

-to talk about endorsement deals.
-Oh, my God.

13:58.254 --> 14:01.548
Yeah. And l spilled coffee on his shirt.

14:01.633 --> 14:03.926
And now it's in the dryer. And, babe,

14:04.010 --> 14:06.094
l would have told you
about this sooner, but. . .

14:06.471 --> 14:07.763
But the less l knew the better.

14:11.017 --> 14:13.185
And this whole time
l've been letting that jealousy monster

-Mmm-hmm.

14:15.396 --> 14:16.813

and l sent him a text message this morning,

14:58.356 --> 15:00.065
and he still hasn't gotten back to me.

15:00.149 --> 15:02.442
He's not worth it, Katie. Just forget it.

15:02.527 --> 15:04.528
No, don't forget it!

He's just gonna do the same thing
to the next girl he thinks has nice hair.
