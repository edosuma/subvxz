What's that?

05:39.380 --> 05:41.966
Repeatitis is when
you repeat things.

It's kind of what I sound like
when I have the hiccups.

09:59.682 --> 10:00.558
Hmm.

10:01.142 --> 10:03.769
Is "hmm" good or bad?

10:04.228 --> 10:07.732
Good. Because I figured out
why Millie has Repeatitis.

10:08.107 --> 10:08.941
Why?

10:09.317 --> 10:11.193
Because her CD is dirty.

10:11.569 --> 10:13.237
Oh.
[gasps]

10:20.119 --> 10:21.203
There you go.

10:21.912 --> 10:23.289
Clean as can be.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.333
I really hopes this works.

10:25.750 --> 10:28.210
I just want to get back
to my music.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.795
I think it worked already!

10:30.379 --> 10:32.757

My Repeatitis is gone!

Oh!

10:37.595 --> 10:40.890

because I'm excited.

By the time we finish,
this is gonna be

12:23.784 --> 12:26.537
the biggest mountain
of sand in the world!

Nice mountain, guys.

We didn't build it.
They did.

Riggo here
is the best toy there is.

I can't.
Riggo's buried in sand!

Help me dig him out.

let's rebuild the mountain.

at fixing toys.

wrong with Will's truck.

Doc McStuffins,
doctor to stuffed animals
and toys, at your service.

13:42.863 --> 13:47.785
I already tried banging it,
so how are you gonna fix it?

13:48.410 --> 13:51.455
Will, I can't really
tell you how I do it,

13:51.539 --> 13:54.500
but trust me,
I know my toys.

13:55.042 --> 13:58.337
Okay, but he's
my favorite toy.

13:59.755 --> 14:02.091
Please take
real good care of him.

14:02.550 --> 14:05.177
Don't worry, Will.
I'll take great
care of him.

Let's go on the slide.

14:07.930 --> 14:09.807

when she's done.

but it's toy fixing time.

14:43.674 --> 14:45.509
Riggo's scoop is stuck.

14:45.593 --> 14:48.804
Yo, Doc,
you can call me Buddy.

14:49.096 --> 14:51.015
And this here's
my best friend Riggo.

14:51.098 --> 14:53.767
We make a great
building team.

14:53.851 --> 14:56.395
That's great,
but we don't have time
to yakkety-yak.

14:56.478 --> 14:57.980
We got a mountain to build.

14:58.230 --> 15:01.483

to build a mountain
with your scoop stuck?

15:03.444 --> 15:05.863
Ooh. That cute little
lamb may be right.

15:05.946 --> 15:08.282

if I can't scoop stuff.

15:08.616 --> 15:10.284
Come on, get outta here.

15:10.367 --> 15:13.370
You're a great toy
even if your scoop
isn't working.

Listen to this guy,
would you?

15:15.331 --> 15:16.790
I'm gonna tell you
something.

You're the best pal
a truck could
ever have.

15:19.710 --> 15:22.922

the sweetest thing ever!

15:23.005 --> 15:26.383
I know! You guys
need a cuddle.

Don't worry, Riggo.
I'm as good at being
a doctor for toys

15:32.848 --> 15:34.558
as you are
at building things.

one first-class doctor.

I want to do.

your reflexes.

It won't hurt.
Just a normal part
of a checkup.

16:25.192 --> 16:28.445
Um, do you need a volunteer
to show Riggo, Doc?

16:28.529 --> 16:30.239
I just give a little tap

16:30.322 --> 16:32.199
to see if her leg's
working right.

lamb there can be brave,

16:36.245 --> 16:37.496
so can I.

16:39.873 --> 16:42.710
Hmm. It didn't move.

16:43.168 --> 16:44.920
I'm still not sure
what's wrong.

16:45.295 --> 16:47.673
Are you feeling
tired or weak?

16:47.756 --> 16:50.384
You kidding me?
I'm as strong as a bull.

16:50.467 --> 16:53.137
Lambie, Stuffy, come on.
Climb into the scoop.

16:54.221 --> 16:56.974
Make way for the dragon!

17:01.812 --> 17:04.397
[giggles]
It's like a bonus cuddle.

17:04.940 --> 17:06.817
You see?
You see that there, Doc?

17:06.900 --> 17:09.528
Look how strong I am.
Strong as a bull.

17:09.611 --> 17:12.406
I mean, I can hold 'em up
really easy, okay?

17:12.489 --> 17:14.199
No sweat whatsoever.

17:14.782 --> 17:19.371
[grunts] Now I just wish
that I could put 'em back down.

17:19.704 --> 17:22.708
It really hurts
when I try to move my scoop.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.376
This is a tough case,

17:24.460 --> 17:27.171
but I'm not gonna
give up till I crack it.

Race you there!

17:28.797 --> 17:29.923
Doc!

17:30.424 --> 17:32.009
Toys, go stuffed!

17:33.761 --> 17:35.345
Doc, did you fix it?

17:36.055 --> 17:37.473
Ow! My eye!

17:37.556 --> 17:40.184
Sorry, Doc.
Are you okay?

17:40.267 --> 17:41.643
I didn't mean
to hurt you.

17:41.727 --> 17:44.688
I know. I know.
I need Mom.

17:46.148 --> 17:49.860
Mom! Mom.
Donny got sand in my eye.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.361
It was an accident!

17:51.445 --> 17:52.821
Okay. Let me see.

17:53.781 --> 17:57.034
Oh, sweetie, you do have
sand in your eye.

17:57.117 --> 17:58.952
It must hurt
to move it around.

17:59.286 --> 18:01.914
Yeah.
It hurts really bad.

18:02.289 --> 18:04.124
Good thing
Dr. Mom is here.

18:04.208 --> 18:06.126
I'll just wash
that sand right out.

18:13.675 --> 18:16.386
Wow!
It feels better already.

18:16.470 --> 18:17.763
Thanks, Mom.

18:17.846 --> 18:19.181
My pleasure.

18:19.640 --> 18:22.476
Even doctors need to see
the doctor sometimes.

18:22.559 --> 18:24.019
[both laugh]

18:24.561 --> 18:26.814
Sorry I got sand
in your eye, Doc.

18:26.897 --> 18:29.441
You have to remember
to be careful around sand.

18:29.525 --> 18:31.693
You shouldn't throw it
or kick it around

18:31.777 --> 18:33.821
because it could get
in someone's eye.

18:33.904 --> 18:35.364
We'll be real careful.

18:35.989 --> 18:38.909
Sand. Yes, that's it!

18:40.160 --> 18:42.871
How about you two
take a few more slides
down?

18:43.288 --> 18:44.748
I think I know
how to fix Riggo.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.166
Cool!

18:46.250 --> 18:48.293
[laughs]
Race you to the slide!

18:48.585 --> 18:51.046
Again? I beat you
last time!

18:55.926 --> 18:58.387
Riggo, I think I know
what's wrong with you.

18:58.846 --> 18:59.847
Oh, yeah, Doc?

18:59.930 --> 19:03.100
Yo, that is great news!
Isn't that great news?

19:03.183 --> 19:04.852
Yeah. What is it, Doc?

19:05.352 --> 19:10.649
Oh, I'm good.
I'm goo-oo-ood
with a capital ood!

19:11.316 --> 19:12.818
I have a diagnosis.

19:13.277 --> 19:15.154
This looks like
one full-blown case

19:15.237 --> 19:17.156
of Sandy Scoop Syndrome.

19:20.534 --> 19:22.786
Riggo has sand
in his joints.

19:24.580 --> 19:27.416
[Buddy]
Oh, yo, that must have
happened at the avalanche.

19:27.791 --> 19:31.086
Buddy is right, Doc.
I was up to my scoop
in sand.

19:31.461 --> 19:33.255
That's what's making
your arms stick.

19:33.338 --> 19:35.257
It hurts when you try
to move,

19:35.340 --> 19:37.509

sand in my eye.

what about my Sandy
Scoop Syndrome?

Can you fix me?

a dump truck could do

20:30.979 --> 20:33.232
'Cause, you know,
I'd do whatever it takes

20:33.315 --> 20:35.609
to help out my best friend
over here.

20:35.692 --> 20:38.403
You know what, buddy?
I totally need your help.

20:38.737 --> 20:42.241
I have a plan,
but I couldn't do it
without you.

20:43.116 --> 20:44.993
Here's what
I need you to do.

20:45.077 --> 20:46.328
[whispering]

20:50.332 --> 20:51.959
Don't let anyone
see us, Buddy.

20:52.042 --> 20:54.836
Hey, don't you worry
your purdy little head.

21:00.717 --> 21:02.302
Everybody ready?

21:02.386 --> 21:03.845
Ready.
You bet!

21:07.474 --> 21:09.017
Way to go!

21:09.309 --> 21:10.936
Hey, you know it!

21:12.062 --> 21:14.648
Remember, Squeakers,
give it full power.

21:14.731 --> 21:15.857
[squeaking]

21:20.195 --> 21:21.280
Ready, Lambie?

21:21.571 --> 21:22.698
Ready, Stuffy!

21:23.115 --> 21:25.492
Carrots, pickles,
walnuts, peas.

21:25.575 --> 21:28.120
Let's give Squeakers
one big squeeze!

21:31.456 --> 21:33.500
Now, that's what
I call teamwork.

21:35.627 --> 21:38.171
Okay, Riggo,
here's the big moment.

21:38.588 --> 21:40.340
Let's see
if your scoop moves.

21:41.591 --> 21:42.676
[squeaking]

21:42.759 --> 21:46.013
Hey! Would ya look at that?
I mean, it works.

21:46.096 --> 21:48.307
And now that the sand
is all gone,

21:48.390 --> 21:50.892
I can move my scoop easy.

21:51.393 --> 21:54.646
I did it! Another toy
good as new!

21:54.730 --> 21:56.523
You did it, Doc!

21:58.775 --> 21:59.943
Thanks a lot, Doc.

22:00.444 --> 22:02.070
You want to know
something else?

22:02.612 --> 22:03.655
You're the greatest.

22:04.072 --> 22:05.824
[giggles] I know.

22:06.199 --> 22:08.410
But I didn't do it
all by myself.

22:08.493 --> 22:11.330
Oh, I'm just glad
to lend a hand. [chuckles]

22:11.413 --> 22:13.915
You know, I'd have
hated to have to build

22:13.999 --> 22:16.043
a mountain of sand
all by myself.

22:16.126 --> 22:18.211
Would you listen
to this big mug?

22:18.503 --> 22:19.921
Now that I'm all better,

22:20.005 --> 22:22.758
I can get back to doing
what I love best.

22:22.841 --> 22:24.092
[together]
Building stuff!

22:27.262 --> 22:28.847
Whoa! [grunts]

22:29.473 --> 22:30.974
[spits, coughs]

22:31.600 --> 22:33.560
I'm okay!
Dragons are tough.

22:34.811 --> 22:38.190
Riggo, be careful
with the sand, remember?

22:38.273 --> 22:40.650
I'm sorry.
I forgot about it.

22:40.734 --> 22:44.279
I got so excited
I just forgot there
for a second is all.

22:45.447 --> 22:48.867
So, what do you say we get back
to building that mountain?

22:52.829 --> 22:53.705
[Donny]
Hey, Doc!

22:53.789 --> 22:54.831
Shh!

22:55.832 --> 22:57.125
Did you fix him?

22:57.584 --> 22:59.503
Why don't you
give him a try?

23:03.131 --> 23:05.801
Riggo!
You're working!

23:06.468 --> 23:07.761
Thanks, Doc.

23:08.136 --> 23:11.223
No problem. Riggo had sand
in his joints,

23:11.473 --> 23:14.142
but it was nothing
Doc McStuffins couldn't fix!

23:14.476 --> 23:17.604
Donny, you have the coolest
big sister ever!

23:17.896 --> 23:19.064
I know.

23:23.485 --> 23:24.986
Good job, Doc.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.446
Thanks, Lambie.

23:26.530 --> 23:30.575
Sometimes I really, really
really, really love my job!

23:32.869 --> 23:34.746
Hey, everybody,
it's Doc here.

23:35.705 --> 23:38.166
<span style="style.default_1">To keep from spreading germs</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to your friends,</span>

23:40.127 --> 23:41.503

23:42.212 --> 23:43.547

<span style="style.default_1">That's right,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">wash your hands.</span>

23:58.353 --> 23:59.354
Aww.
