<i>Previously on</i> The Vampire Diaries:

00:03.870 --> 00:06.361
For over a century,
I've lived in secret. Until now.

00:06.539 --> 00:08.530
I know the risk, but I have to know her.

00:08.708 --> 00:11.074
- What are you?
- I'm a vampire.

00:11.277 --> 00:13.074
He told me about your ex, Katherine.

00:13.279 --> 00:16.180
- You must be Elena.
- How do we look exactly alike?

00:16.349 --> 00:18.180
The Lockwoods are werewolves.

00:18.351 --> 00:21.252
- Tell me what triggers the curse.
- You have to kill somebody.

00:21.421 --> 00:22.888
Paralyzed from the waist down.

00:24.257 --> 00:25.884
- And dead.
- Matt fails, I can't.

00:29.429 --> 00:31.556
- Tyler, what's happening?
- Get away.

00:31.731 --> 00:34.063
- Get away!
- What's happening?

00:35.168 --> 00:39.366
We were stupid, thinking that we
weren't gonna get caught. But it's over.

00:39.539 --> 00:43.270
Elena's in danger. She's the
doppelganger. She needs to be protected.

00:43.443 --> 00:45.308
- Then I'll protect her.
- Please, Damon.

01:15.842 --> 01:18.037
- Where is she?
- In the trunk.

01:18.211 --> 01:20.145
I did exactly what you said.

01:20.346 --> 01:22.576
Good. Put her in the back.

01:45.472 --> 01:48.236
- Thank you for your help.
- Is there anything else?

01:48.408 --> 01:51.275
One more thing. Come closer, please.

01:55.448 --> 01:56.574
Closer.

02:31.317 --> 02:33.046
Yo, Elena.

02:50.837 --> 02:53.829
So Sarah attacks Tyler
and he pushed her away...

02:54.007 --> 02:56.805
...and she tripped
and she fell and she hit her head.

02:56.976 --> 03:00.173
- Does Matt remember anything?
- He thinks he blacked out.

03:01.014 --> 03:04.006
But I think... I think they were both
compelled by Katherine.

03:04.184 --> 03:07.051
And that's why I covered for Tyler,
said it was an accident.

03:07.220 --> 03:09.586
Yeah, I don't understand that.
Guy's a tool.

03:09.756 --> 03:12.725
Well, gee, duh.
Tyler getting blamed for Sarah's death...

03:12.892 --> 03:15.725
...just opens up questions
that he can't answer.

03:15.895 --> 03:20.389
And do you really think it's a good idea
for him to tell his mom he's a werewolf?

03:20.567 --> 03:22.398
- Well, no.
- And that werewolf road...

03:22.569 --> 03:24.662
...leads straight to Vampire Boulevard.

03:24.837 --> 03:27.772
- I thought I was thinking fast on my feet.
- Where's your mom?

03:27.974 --> 03:29.999
Leading the search party
for Aimee Bradley.

03:30.176 --> 03:33.771
- They haven't found her body yet.
- Teens and their underage drinking.

03:33.980 --> 03:37.074
Tragic. Wait. Did you see
Tyler's eyes turn yellow?

03:37.717 --> 03:41.653
- They were gold with amber highlights.
- Oh.

03:41.821 --> 03:44.381
- Can he turn into a wolf now?
- Only on a full moon.

03:44.557 --> 03:47.117
Now he has increased strength,
and who knows what else?

03:47.293 --> 03:50.057
I wonder how much Mason told him.
Does he know about us?

03:50.863 --> 03:52.558
Hey. What'd you tell him?

03:52.732 --> 03:55.098
Nothing, really. L...

03:55.268 --> 03:57.133
I don't think he knows
much of anything.

03:57.303 --> 04:01.034
He seemed really freaked out,
and, honestly...

04:02.508 --> 04:03.907
...felt kind of bad for him.

04:06.045 --> 04:09.276
- He's gotta know something.
- All right. I'll ask him.

04:10.283 --> 04:12.979
No, you won't, Caroline.
He cannot know about us.

04:13.152 --> 04:17.486
A bite from a werewolf can kill a vampire,
so don't be his friend. Understand me?

04:17.656 --> 04:18.714
I understand.

04:20.726 --> 04:23.560
- I'm late for school.
- Right.

04:25.798 --> 04:29.290
If you wanna hint to your mom
that Aimee's at the bottom of a ravine...

04:29.469 --> 04:31.437
...might save your mom some time.

04:49.989 --> 04:53.322
- Oh, that's great.
- That's what I told him.

05:25.525 --> 05:27.550
- Hey, Jeremy.
- Elena's gotta let me know...

05:27.727 --> 05:31.561
...if I'm supposed to cover for her.
Jenna's cool, but you guys are pushing it.

05:31.731 --> 05:32.959
- What?
- You and Elena.

05:33.132 --> 05:36.499
I'm glad you guys are back together,
but if she's gonna sleep over...

05:36.669 --> 05:39.536
Wait. Hold on a minute.
We're not back together.

05:39.706 --> 05:42.197
Wait, she didn't stay
at your place last night?

05:42.375 --> 05:45.674
No. I saw her at the party,
but that was it. She didn't sleep over.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.010
Because her bed hadn't been slept in.

05:48.181 --> 05:51.639
And Mrs. Lockwood said that her car
was still in the driveway.

05:52.852 --> 05:53.910
Where is she, then?

06:16.442 --> 06:18.569
Oh, please.

06:32.725 --> 06:34.989
- What do you want?
- Shh.

06:36.195 --> 06:38.390
- Please, I'm hurt.
- I know.

06:40.166 --> 06:41.963
- Just a taste.
- No!

06:42.168 --> 06:44.932
Trevor. Control yourself.

06:49.675 --> 06:50.869
Buzz kill.

06:53.613 --> 06:56.912
- What do you want with me?
- My God, you look just like her.

06:57.083 --> 07:00.280
- But I'm not. Please, whatever you...
- Be quiet.

07:00.753 --> 07:02.050
But I'm not Katherine.

07:02.455 --> 07:05.288
My name is Elena Gilbert.
You don't have to do this.

07:05.458 --> 07:07.551
I know who you are. I said, be quiet.

07:08.461 --> 07:10.190
What do you want?

07:12.231 --> 07:14.222
I want you to be quiet.

07:21.641 --> 07:25.509
- This has Katherine written all over it.
- Katherine's in the tomb. I shut her in.

07:25.678 --> 07:27.373
- Did you?
- Did I what, Stefan?

07:27.547 --> 07:32.507
- I know the hold Katherine has on you.
- She's in the tomb. Period. End of story.

07:33.519 --> 07:36.352
But she did say something
to me right before I shut her in.

07:37.056 --> 07:39.388
- I thought she was lying.
- What did she say?

07:40.893 --> 07:44.226
- Elena's in danger.
- And you didn't ask her to elaborate?

07:44.397 --> 07:47.696
Everything she says is a lie.
How am I supposed to know?

07:47.867 --> 07:49.892
- We have to go talk to her.
- No, no.

07:50.069 --> 07:52.697
We're gonna ask for help,
she's gonna negotiate a release...

07:52.872 --> 07:56.433
...which you're gonna give her,
and then she's gonna get out and kill us.

07:56.609 --> 07:59.237
- I don't really care.
- It's a bad idea, Stefan.

07:59.946 --> 08:01.436
It's Elena.

08:13.092 --> 08:16.550
- Caroline.
- Hey. How are you doing?

08:16.729 --> 08:18.094
- Not good.
- How's your mom?

08:18.264 --> 08:22.257
My mom said she was freaked out about
everything that happened with Sarah.

08:23.469 --> 08:25.232
How did you know?

08:25.638 --> 08:27.572
- What do you mean?
- About me.

08:29.008 --> 08:33.001
- How did you know?
- Know what? That you were upset?

08:33.212 --> 08:36.909
I thought I was doing a good thing
by covering for you.

08:37.350 --> 08:41.480
- That's not what I'm talking about.
- Look, it was an accident, okay?

08:41.654 --> 08:45.818
And I've gotta run.
Just please don't blame yourself.

08:48.928 --> 08:50.793
- How's the girl?
- Still passed out.

08:50.963 --> 08:53.659
- You didn't touch her, did you?
- Give me some credit.

08:53.833 --> 08:57.462
- So you called him?
- No, I called one of his contacts.

08:57.637 --> 08:59.298
You know how this works.

08:59.472 --> 09:02.373
Did you or did you not
get the message to Elijah?

09:03.042 --> 09:06.136
- They say he got it.
- Wonderful. And what?

09:06.312 --> 09:10.112
So that's it, Trevor. He either got it
or he didn't. We just have to wait.

09:10.283 --> 09:13.878
It's not too late. We can leave her.
We don't have to go through with this.

09:14.053 --> 09:16.180
- I'm sick of running.
- Yeah?

09:16.355 --> 09:18.823
Well, running keeps us from dying.

09:18.991 --> 09:22.222
Elijah's old-school.
If he accepts our deal, we're free.

09:23.696 --> 09:25.095
You.

09:26.832 --> 09:28.857
There's nothing around here for miles.

09:29.035 --> 09:32.300
If you think you're getting out,
you're wrong. Understand?

09:32.471 --> 09:34.462
Who's Elijah?

09:34.640 --> 09:36.471
He's your worst nightmare.

09:39.912 --> 09:43.814
I can't undo the tomb spell, Stefan.
Even if I wanted to.

09:43.983 --> 09:46.543
It took both me
and my Grams to do it the first time.

09:46.719 --> 09:49.313
But I can open the door, right?
I could talk to her?

09:49.488 --> 09:53.151
Yeah, but Damon's right.
She's not gonna tell you anything.

09:53.326 --> 09:56.090
- Not without something in return.
- I have to do something.

09:56.295 --> 09:59.059
I have no idea who has Elena.
I have no idea where she is.

10:02.435 --> 10:05.495
What if there was
another way to find her?

10:08.174 --> 10:09.436
How does this work?

10:09.609 --> 10:12.407
I'll use your blood to draw energy
for the tracking spell.

10:12.578 --> 10:15.342
You're blood-related.
It'll make the connection stronger.

10:15.514 --> 10:19.951
Alaric said we gotta clear out within 10
minutes. I got weapons. He stocked me up.

10:20.119 --> 10:22.383
Are you ready?

10:58.491 --> 10:59.617
There.

11:00.926 --> 11:03.121
- She's there.
- That's 300 miles away.

11:03.295 --> 11:05.820
No, Bonnie,
we need a more exact location than that.

11:05.998 --> 11:08.831
- That's as close as I can get.
- We can map it. Aerial view.

11:09.001 --> 11:11.492
It'll show us what's around,
help us narrow the area.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.265
- Call me with whatever you find.
- I'm coming with you.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.408
- No, you're not.
- I'm not gonna sit here.

11:16.575 --> 11:18.566
- What if she's hurt? What if...?
- She's not.

11:18.744 --> 11:20.268
You two go back to your house.

11:20.446 --> 11:23.813
- I'm gonna call the minute I find her.
- You can't do this alone.

11:23.983 --> 11:25.814
He's not. Let's go.

11:25.985 --> 11:28.920
- You're coming with me?
- It's Elena.

11:36.729 --> 11:38.492
Hey, Tyler.

11:38.664 --> 11:41.428
- Lockwood, over here.
- Get that guy. Get that guy.

11:41.600 --> 11:42.999
- Watch him.
- Cover him.

11:43.169 --> 11:44.830
- Get in. Get in.
- Get that guy.

11:45.004 --> 11:46.335
Shoot. Shoot. Shoot it.

11:46.505 --> 11:48.735
- Come on. Come on.
- Oh!

11:48.908 --> 11:51.308
- Man.
- Dude, what the hell was that?

11:51.477 --> 11:53.342
- Our ball.
- Where'd that come from?

11:53.512 --> 11:55.537
- Heh. How'd you do that?
- Reset.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.183
- Hey, Tyler, where you going?
- Come on, man.

11:58.350 --> 12:00.443
- Dude, where you going?
- Let's go.

12:00.619 --> 12:02.746
- We're in the middle of a game.
- Let's go.

12:02.922 --> 12:06.358
Hey. Um, are you okay?

12:06.525 --> 12:09.050
You lied to me earlier. Why?

12:09.729 --> 12:13.187
Look, Tyler, I think that you
misunderstood me at the party.

12:13.866 --> 12:16.596
- I get it. It was very traumatic.
- You're lying.

12:17.770 --> 12:21.035
- Nope. But I'm late.
- Hey.

12:29.715 --> 12:32.582
How did you...?
You're stronger than me?

12:32.752 --> 12:35.277
Please, that was nothing.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.922
Listen, if you know something,
you gotta tell me.

12:38.090 --> 12:41.582
- Because I can't handle this.
- I'm sorry, Tyler.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.787
But I think that you're still in shock
over Sarah dying.

12:44.997 --> 12:46.259
And it's understandable.

13:09.722 --> 13:11.747
Alaric sure likes his weapons.

13:13.459 --> 13:14.483
What is that?

13:14.660 --> 13:17.629
It's a vervain bomb or a grenade
launcher, something like that.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.095
- Weird.
- Hey, how much further is it?

13:20.266 --> 13:22.791
- About 80 miles.
- Who do you think took her?

13:23.636 --> 13:27.595
Someone from Katherine's past. She
said she was running from someone.

13:27.773 --> 13:29.263
Maybe they got the wrong girl.

13:32.144 --> 13:34.578
Thank you. For helping me.

13:34.747 --> 13:37.272
Can we not do the
whole road-trip-bonding thing?

13:37.449 --> 13:40.475
- Cliché of it all makes me itch.
- Aw, come on, Damon.

13:40.653 --> 13:44.521
We both know that you being in this car
has nothing to do with me anyway.

13:44.690 --> 13:47.181
And the elephant in the room
lets out a mighty roar.

13:47.359 --> 13:50.522
It doesn't have to be an elephant.
You know, let's talk about it.

13:50.696 --> 13:53.790
- There's nothing to talk about.
- That's not true. Sure, there is.

13:53.966 --> 13:56.764
Are you in this car because
you wanna help your brother...

13:56.936 --> 13:59.268
...save the girl that he loves, or is it...?

13:59.505 --> 14:02.997
Is it because you love her too? Hmm?

14:03.175 --> 14:06.941
I mean, come on. Express yourself.
I happen to like road-trip bonding.

14:07.112 --> 14:11.105
Keep it up, Stefan. I can step out of
helping as easily as I stepped in.

14:12.618 --> 14:16.213
Nope. See, that's the beauty of it.

14:17.022 --> 14:18.182
You can't.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.101
Alaric just left with Jenna.

14:31.270 --> 14:33.704
He's getting her out
so she doesn't ask about Elena.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.864
I pulled this up based on the map.

14:36.041 --> 14:38.202
There's nothing except
for this old house.

14:38.377 --> 14:40.845
- Did you send it to Stefan?
- Yeah.

14:44.016 --> 14:46.610
I hate sitting here waiting like this.

14:48.187 --> 14:49.552
Hey.

14:50.990 --> 14:52.855
She's gonna be fine.

14:54.260 --> 14:55.522
You don't know that.

14:57.229 --> 14:58.924
No, I don't.

15:07.539 --> 15:10.667
- What are you doing?
- There's something else I wanna try.

15:12.945 --> 15:14.742
I don't get it.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.075
I need a candle.
And grab Elena's hairbrush.

15:17.850 --> 15:19.784
Uh, okay, yeah.

15:33.599 --> 15:34.861
What's all this stuff for?

15:35.034 --> 15:39.903
I know it's crazy,
but I might be able to get her a message.

15:57.923 --> 15:58.947
Bonnie?

16:00.492 --> 16:01.516
Bonnie.

16:01.694 --> 16:05.892
Bonnie. Bonnie. Bonnie.

16:09.735 --> 16:10.759
Wha...?

16:15.741 --> 16:16.765
Bonnie.

16:16.942 --> 16:19.467
Bonnie! Bonnie! Bonnie!

16:21.080 --> 16:22.809
Why am I here?

16:22.982 --> 16:25.644
You keep asking me questions
like I'm gonna answer them.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.810
- Why won't you?
- That's another one.

16:28.988 --> 16:32.287
You got me, okay?
It's not like I can go anywhere.

16:32.458 --> 16:34.756
The least you can do
is tell me what you want.

16:34.927 --> 16:38.158
I personally want nothing.
I'm just a delivery service.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.730
Delivery to who? Elijah?

16:41.166 --> 16:43.828
Ha, ha. Two points to the eavesdropper.

16:44.003 --> 16:49.441
- Who is he? Is he a vampire?
- He's one of the vampires. The Originals.

16:50.042 --> 16:52.510
- What do you mean?
- Again with the questions.

16:52.678 --> 16:55.841
Haven't the Salvatores been
teaching you vampire history?

16:56.015 --> 16:59.781
- So you know Stefan and Damon?
- I know of them.

16:59.952 --> 17:03.615
A hundred years back, a friend
of mine tried to set me up with Stefan.

17:03.789 --> 17:05.689
She said he was one of the good ones.

17:05.858 --> 17:09.123
More of a sucker
for the bad boys, though, but I digress.

17:10.162 --> 17:11.891
Who are the Originals?

17:16.468 --> 17:19.164
Trevor and I have been
running for 500 years.

17:19.338 --> 17:22.136
We're tired. We want it over.

17:22.307 --> 17:25.503
We're using you to negotiate
ourselves out of an old mess.

17:25.676 --> 17:27.406
But why me?

17:28.146 --> 17:29.978
Because you're
a Petrova doppelganger.

17:31.316 --> 17:35.650
- You're the key to breaking the curse.
- Curse?

17:36.889 --> 17:40.154
- The Sun and the Moon curse?
- You do know your history.

17:40.325 --> 17:44.659
What do you mean, I'm the key?
The moonstone is what breaks the curse.

17:44.830 --> 17:48.095
No. The moonstone
is what binds the curse.

17:48.300 --> 17:51.667
- Sacrifice is what breaks it.
- Sacrifice?

17:51.837 --> 17:55.295
The blood of the doppelganger.
You're the doppelganger.

17:56.241 --> 17:59.836
Which means, in order to break
the curse, you're the one that has to die.

18:16.128 --> 18:17.686
Mom?

18:38.383 --> 18:40.078
- What are you doing here?
- I know.

18:40.285 --> 18:42.412
Breaking and entering
the sheriff's house?

18:42.588 --> 18:46.183
- That move will win you an award.
- Go ahead, keep dodging.

18:46.859 --> 18:49.157
Keep changing the subject.

18:49.328 --> 18:51.159
But I know.

18:51.597 --> 18:54.395
You're just like me, aren't you?

18:55.167 --> 18:59.069
- No.
- Keep it up, but I'm not buying it.

19:00.072 --> 19:01.437
I saw how strong you were.

19:03.242 --> 19:06.234
I'm not leaving here
until you tell me the truth.

19:07.312 --> 19:11.442
- Tyler.
- You're a werewolf.

19:12.050 --> 19:13.608
Say it.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.319
What?

19:22.394 --> 19:24.123
- Stop lying.
- I'm not lying.

19:24.329 --> 19:25.887
Just say it!

19:35.707 --> 19:37.937
I'm not a werewolf, okay?

19:43.382 --> 19:44.940
Tell me more.

19:45.384 --> 19:47.750
Captivity's made her pushy, eh?

19:48.754 --> 19:51.120
What do you wanna know,
doppelicious?

19:52.124 --> 19:53.352
Who are you running from?

19:53.892 --> 19:55.621
- The Originals.
- Yeah. She said that.

19:55.794 --> 19:59.958
- What does that mean?
- The first family. The Old World.

20:00.132 --> 20:02.498
- Rose and I pissed them off.
- Mm-mm.

20:02.668 --> 20:04.465
Correction, I pissed them off.

20:04.636 --> 20:09.039
Rose had my back. And for over half
a millennium, they've wanted us dead.

20:10.509 --> 20:12.067
What did you do?

20:12.244 --> 20:15.873
He made the same mistake countless
others did. He trusted Katerina Petrova.

20:16.481 --> 20:19.450
- Katherine.
- The one and only.

20:19.618 --> 20:21.449
The first Petrova doppelganger.

20:22.955 --> 20:25.753
I helped her escape her fate,
and now I've...

20:25.924 --> 20:28.757
Sorry, we've been marked ever since.

20:28.927 --> 20:32.021
Which is why we're not gonna make
the same mistake again.

20:39.671 --> 20:42.606
- Here, drink this.
- Thanks.

20:44.977 --> 20:47.502
What happened?
You scared the hell out of me.

20:47.679 --> 20:50.512
- It's nothing.
- No, it wasn't nothing, Bonnie.

20:51.350 --> 20:55.309
I've been doing a lot of magic lately.
Wears me down.

20:55.487 --> 20:59.651
When I'm worn down, I take a nap.
You were unconscious.

21:00.292 --> 21:03.557
Witchcraft has its limits.

21:03.729 --> 21:07.165
If I push too hard, it pushes back.

21:07.332 --> 21:10.301
- How do you know all this?
- It's all in here.

21:10.469 --> 21:13.029
It's like a reminder
that I'm not invincible.

21:15.641 --> 21:18.872
Please don't...

21:19.044 --> 21:21.342
- Don't tell anyone.
- Why not?

21:21.513 --> 21:25.381
Because it's a weakness. And I don't
want certain people to know that.

21:25.851 --> 21:27.580
Certain people, you mean Damon.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.717
I mean anyone that could hurt me.

21:33.492 --> 21:36.154
I won't tell anyone, okay? I promise.

21:41.767 --> 21:44.668
It's hard, you know? Grams is gone.

21:44.836 --> 21:47.327
And my dad, he doesn't
wanna know about what I am.

21:47.506 --> 21:49.406
He hasn't since my mom left.

21:51.777 --> 21:54.109
I'm all alone in this.

21:55.280 --> 21:59.546
That's how I feel
a lot of the time. Alone.

22:04.523 --> 22:07.356
Uh, you think that worked?

22:07.693 --> 22:09.991
I have no idea.

22:37.089 --> 22:41.583
We're getting close. Jeremy said there's
an access road just past mile marker six.

22:50.135 --> 22:52.569
- Lf you want some, just ask.
- I want some.

22:52.738 --> 22:54.262
Aw, that's so sweet.

22:54.439 --> 22:56.930
You wanna be all big and strong
and save your girl.

22:57.109 --> 22:59.270
Don't worry, I've got your back.
You'll be fine.

22:59.444 --> 23:03.141
I'm not joking.
I've been drinking a little every day.

23:03.315 --> 23:08.309
Been slowly increasing my intake
and building up my strength.

23:13.859 --> 23:16.157
Elena know you're drinking blood?

23:21.166 --> 23:22.827
I've been drinking hers.

23:26.938 --> 23:30.305
Mm. How romantic.

23:32.110 --> 23:33.839
Since we're road-trip bonding...

23:34.012 --> 23:37.106
...remember the days
when all you lived for was blood?

23:37.282 --> 23:40.843
You were the guy that would rip
someone apart just for the fun of it?

23:41.019 --> 23:43.988
- You mean when I was more like you?
- Yes, Stefan, exactly.

23:44.156 --> 23:47.614
Back when you put blood into me
so I could be a big, bad vampire.

23:48.193 --> 23:51.356
I wonder if Elena would be so quick
to open her veins to that guy.

23:52.230 --> 23:54.630
By the way, what happened to that guy?
He was a hoot.

23:56.535 --> 23:59.163
Guess he found
something else to live for.

24:08.847 --> 24:11.714
He's here. This was a mistake.

24:11.883 --> 24:14.374
No, I told you I would get us out of this.
Trust me.

24:14.553 --> 24:17.886
- No. He wants me dead, Rose.
- He wants her more.

24:18.056 --> 24:20.752
I can't. You give her to him,
he'll have mercy on you.

24:20.926 --> 24:22.894
- But I need to get out of here.
- Hey.

24:24.029 --> 24:25.053
What are we?

24:28.567 --> 24:29.625
We're family.

24:31.570 --> 24:32.662
Forever.

24:37.075 --> 24:38.133
You're scared.

24:39.377 --> 24:42.278
Stay here with her.
And don't make a sound.

25:09.438 --> 25:11.338
Rose-Marie.

25:11.874 --> 25:13.432
Is there somewhere we can talk?

25:15.211 --> 25:17.441
Yes, in here.

25:18.013 --> 25:22.211
- You have to forgive the house.
- Oh, no. What's a little dirt?

25:22.384 --> 25:24.682
I completely understand.

25:25.654 --> 25:29.351
So tell me, what is it that gives
you the courage to call me?

25:29.525 --> 25:32.255
I wanted my freedom.
I'm tired of running.

25:32.428 --> 25:34.396
Are you in a position to grant me that?

25:34.563 --> 25:37.964
I have complete authority to grant
pardon to you and your little pet...

25:38.167 --> 25:40.897
What is his name these days? Trevor.

25:41.070 --> 25:42.799
- If I so see fit.

25:43.439 --> 25:44.736
Katerina Petrova.

25:48.410 --> 25:51.971
- I'm listening.
- She didn't burn in the church in 1864.

25:55.684 --> 25:57.948
- Continue.
- She survived.

25:59.455 --> 26:02.652
- Where is she?
- You don't seem surprised by this.

26:02.825 --> 26:06.488
Oh, when you called and invited me
into this armpit of civilization...

26:06.695 --> 26:09.163
...which is a mere three hours
from Mystic Falls...

26:09.331 --> 26:11.822
...I surmised it had
everything to do with Katerina.

26:13.068 --> 26:14.797
Do you have her in your possession?

26:15.504 --> 26:18.098
No. But I have better.

26:18.474 --> 26:21.807
- I have her doppelganger.
- That's impossible.

26:21.977 --> 26:24.605
Her family line ended with her.
I know that for a fact.

26:24.780 --> 26:25.974
Then the facts are wrong.

26:28.117 --> 26:31.575
- Well, show her to me.
- Elijah, you're a man of honor...

26:31.754 --> 26:35.485
...you're to be trusted,
but I wanna hear you say it again.

26:37.726 --> 26:40.126
You have my word
that I will pardon you.

26:42.231 --> 26:43.789
Follow me.

27:22.071 --> 27:25.905
Human. It's impossible.

27:28.410 --> 27:29.672
Hello there.

27:36.785 --> 27:38.650
House should be just
beyond those trees.

27:38.821 --> 27:41.984
I've got more experience than you do
with this sort of thing.

27:42.725 --> 27:43.987
So, what's your point?

27:44.159 --> 27:48.493
Whoever has Elena is who was
after Katherine in 1864 and before that.

27:48.664 --> 27:51.428
- And?
- It puts them at 500 years old and strong.

27:51.600 --> 27:54.364
- You sure you wanna do this?
- Yeah, I'm certain.

27:54.536 --> 27:56.367
Because we go in,
we may not come back.

27:56.538 --> 27:59.837
- All right, then I won't come out.
- So noble, Stefan.

28:01.543 --> 28:04.535
I can't think of a better reason to die.

28:05.314 --> 28:08.010
But you wanna stay here,
I'll totally understand.

28:15.524 --> 28:17.958
We have a long journey ahead.
We should be going.

28:18.127 --> 28:21.528
- Please, don't let him take me.
- One last piece of business.

28:22.398 --> 28:23.763
Then we're done.

28:26.869 --> 28:29.963
I've waited so long for this day, Elijah.

28:30.139 --> 28:33.768
- I'm truly very sorry.
- Oh, no, your apology is not necessary.

28:33.942 --> 28:36.843
Yes. Yes, it is.

28:37.846 --> 28:42.408
You trusted me with Katerina
and I failed you.

28:43.285 --> 28:46.118
Well, yes, you are the guilty one.

28:46.288 --> 28:49.849
And Rose aided you because
she was loyal to you. That I honor.

28:53.162 --> 28:54.925
Where was your loyalty?

28:56.965 --> 28:58.489
I beg your forgiveness.

29:00.269 --> 29:01.463
So granted.

29:07.309 --> 29:09.869
- You...
- Don't, Rose.

29:12.247 --> 29:13.509
Now that you're free.

29:17.086 --> 29:19.020
- Come.
- No, what about the moonstone?

29:20.289 --> 29:22.189
What do you know
about the moonstone?

29:22.691 --> 29:24.989
I know that you need it.
And I know where it is.

29:25.794 --> 29:28.285
- Yes?
- I can help you get it.

29:28.464 --> 29:31.126
- Tell me where it is.
- It doesn't work that way.

29:33.168 --> 29:35.659
Are you negotiating with me?

29:35.838 --> 29:38.807
It's the first I've heard of it.

29:47.816 --> 29:50.148
What is this vervain
doing around your neck?

29:54.523 --> 29:56.047
Tell me where the moonstone is.

29:57.626 --> 29:59.560
In the tomb
underneath the church ruins.

29:59.728 --> 30:03.027
- What is it doing there?
- It's with Katherine.

30:03.198 --> 30:04.222
Interesting.

30:06.935 --> 30:09.062
- What is that?
- I don't know.

30:09.238 --> 30:11.934
- Who else is in this house?
- I don't know.

30:17.246 --> 30:18.645
Move.

30:31.593 --> 30:34.084
- Rose?
- I don't know who it is.

30:37.466 --> 30:38.831
Up here.

30:42.504 --> 30:44.404
Down here.

31:00.389 --> 31:02.016
Excuse me.

31:03.392 --> 31:05.451
To whom it may concern.

31:05.627 --> 31:08.721
You're making a grave mistake
if you think you can beat me.

31:09.364 --> 31:12.492
You can't. You hear that?

31:12.935 --> 31:17.531
I repeat, you cannot beat me.

31:17.706 --> 31:23.042
So I want the girl
on the count of three.

31:23.912 --> 31:25.709
Or heads will roll.

31:30.919 --> 31:34.320
- Do we understand each other?
- I'll come with you.

31:34.523 --> 31:38.516
Just please don't hurt my friends.
They just wanted to help me out.

31:44.433 --> 31:46.663
What game are you playing with me?

32:35.517 --> 32:37.348
Just let her go.

32:43.625 --> 32:45.456
Hey, come here. You hurt? You okay?

32:55.170 --> 32:56.467
<i>Thank you.</i>

32:56.638 --> 32:58.299
<i>Sure.</i>

33:21.096 --> 33:22.757
Elena?

33:31.473 --> 33:32.565
Oh, my God.

33:35.644 --> 33:38.841
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

33:41.416 --> 33:42.678
I'm okay.

33:44.753 --> 33:46.084
I got your message.

34:18.152 --> 34:20.643
- Where's Elena?
- She's home.

34:20.822 --> 34:24.724
- And you're here why?
- Because she wanted to be with Jeremy.

34:24.893 --> 34:27.690
- Here.
- Thanks.

34:28.663 --> 34:32.860
Listen, what Rose told Elena
about the curse...

34:33.034 --> 34:34.730
I know. We'll keep her safe.

34:36.638 --> 34:40.630
The only way we're gonna be able to do
that is if we're not fighting each other.

34:42.411 --> 34:44.038
We let Katherine come between us.

34:44.212 --> 34:47.237
We let that happen with Elena,
we're not gonna protect her.

34:47.416 --> 34:49.748
Yes, Stefan, heard it all before.

34:52.320 --> 34:54.880
- Hey.
- What?

34:56.558 --> 34:59.254
- I'm sorry.
- About what?

35:01.029 --> 35:04.362
For being the guy
who made you turn 145 years ago.

35:06.234 --> 35:09.829
Enough, Stef. It's late.
No need to rehash that.

35:10.005 --> 35:12.940
Well, you know what?
I've never said it out loud.

35:13.708 --> 35:16.768
I guess I just need to say it
and you need to hear it.

35:18.847 --> 35:20.508
I'm sorry.

35:21.550 --> 35:23.711
What I did was selfish.

35:23.885 --> 35:25.785
I didn't wanna be alone.

35:28.523 --> 35:30.855
Guess I just needed my brother.

35:39.434 --> 35:42.460
You know, this sounds crazy,
but alcohol helps.

35:42.671 --> 35:44.195
Or at least it helps me.

35:44.873 --> 35:47.808
You know,
with all that inside jittery stuff.

35:47.976 --> 35:51.537
I'm hot. It's like my skin is on fire.

35:52.314 --> 35:55.181
Really? I never had any of that.

35:57.219 --> 35:58.686
Guess wolves are different. Heh.

36:01.123 --> 36:05.355
At the beginning,
I was very, very emotional.

36:05.527 --> 36:08.223
- Everything was heightened.
- I have that.

36:12.267 --> 36:13.825
How can you be a vampire?

36:15.704 --> 36:17.194
How can you be a werewolf?

36:21.743 --> 36:22.835
Who else is like you?

36:25.981 --> 36:27.642
Just me.

36:28.450 --> 36:31.613
It's a really long story.
We can share another time.

36:31.786 --> 36:34.254
How many other
werewolves are there?

36:35.824 --> 36:36.916
Just me.

36:37.792 --> 36:40.955
And my Uncle Mason,
but he left town.

36:41.963 --> 36:44.727
Look, Tyler...

36:46.034 --> 36:47.968
...you can't tell anyone.

36:48.136 --> 36:50.661
Okay? Not about you, not about me.

36:50.839 --> 36:54.935
- No one will understand.
- I know.

36:55.677 --> 37:00.478
I wanna tell you
about my mom and yours...

37:00.649 --> 37:05.109
...and the founding families
and the council, but I need you...

37:05.287 --> 37:09.883
...to promise me
no one will find out about us.

37:11.893 --> 37:14.987
This is life and death, Tyler.

37:16.498 --> 37:18.659
I have no one else to tell.

37:22.571 --> 37:26.200
I'm sorry about earlier. It's just...

37:27.209 --> 37:29.643
I'm alone with this.

37:29.811 --> 37:31.711
It's gonna happen to me.

37:31.880 --> 37:35.179
On the next full moon I'm gonna turn...

37:35.350 --> 37:37.318
...and I won't be able to stop it.

37:41.056 --> 37:42.353
I'm scared.

37:45.293 --> 37:49.161
Tyler. No, it's...

38:10.952 --> 38:12.385
Who's there?

38:15.190 --> 38:16.748
I'm not here to hurt you.

38:17.626 --> 38:18.718
Why are you here?

38:18.893 --> 38:21.418
Lexi once told me
that you're one of the good ones.

38:22.397 --> 38:23.557
You knew Lexi.

38:24.566 --> 38:26.898
Trevor was my best friend.

38:27.469 --> 38:30.768
For 500 years,
I have lived with one person.

38:31.873 --> 38:33.340
And he's gone.

38:35.543 --> 38:39.479
I don't wanna run anymore because
I don't have anywhere else to run to.

38:39.648 --> 38:41.707
Well, I'm sorry, but I can't help you.

38:42.751 --> 38:44.912
I don't need your help.

38:45.553 --> 38:47.111
But I think you need mine.

38:49.357 --> 38:51.382
Elijah may be dead,
but this isn't over.

38:51.559 --> 38:55.325
- What do you mean it's not over?
- It isn't over.

38:55.497 --> 38:58.625
The Originals, they'll come for her.

39:00.935 --> 39:02.732
They have to.

39:04.005 --> 39:05.302
They're doing it for him.

39:06.508 --> 39:10.137
- For who?
- Klaus.

39:24.893 --> 39:26.690
Cute PJs.

39:29.130 --> 39:30.427
I'm tired, Damon.

39:34.502 --> 39:37.630
- Brought you this.
- I thought that was gone.

39:40.809 --> 39:42.504
Thank you.

39:45.113 --> 39:46.774
Please give it back.

39:47.615 --> 39:49.014
I just have to say something.

39:49.651 --> 39:51.676
Why do you have to say it
with my necklace?

39:54.356 --> 39:56.984
Because what I'm about to say is...

39:58.560 --> 40:01.552
...probably the most selfish thing
I've ever said in my life.

40:02.997 --> 40:05.795
- Damon, don't go there.
- No, I just have to say it once.

40:05.967 --> 40:07.935
You just need to hear it.

40:10.538 --> 40:12.472
I love you, Elena.

40:14.476 --> 40:17.673
And it's because I love you that...

40:20.181 --> 40:22.012
...I can't be selfish with you.

40:24.018 --> 40:26.714
And why you can't know this.

40:28.056 --> 40:29.751
I don't deserve you.

40:32.494 --> 40:34.587
But my brother does.

40:48.343 --> 40:51.335
God, I wish
you didn't have to forget this.

40:54.749 --> 40:56.614
But you do.
