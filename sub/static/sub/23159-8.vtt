WEBVTT

00:00.023 --> 00:03.322
I'm going to cut you to shreds
just as I always have.

00:06.329 --> 00:08.422
You've given me back my life.

00:08.464 --> 00:12.628
He was arrogant
and he brutalized my mother.

00:12.669 --> 00:15.502
- Who are you trying to protect?
- Don't be preposterous.

00:15.538 --> 00:19.668
I've more pressing matters on my mind
than a tryst between you and Velma.

00:19.709 --> 00:22.769
He took from me
things that were irreplaceable.

00:22.812 --> 00:25.781
She told me that Jonathan Higgins
as good as confessed.

00:25.815 --> 00:29.876
- Higgins, shut up.
- I'm not one of your clients. Stay out of this!

01:36.953 --> 01:38.944
- Go on, Willy!
- Go on, Willy!

01:54.103 --> 01:56.697
Caught you, Johnjohn, you silly little nob.

02:08.918 --> 02:10.818
Come on, Willy!

02:17.093 --> 02:20.085
All right, now.
What's the meaning of all of this?

02:21.431 --> 02:23.899
What have you got to say for yourself?

02:28.171 --> 02:29.468
Hands.

03:14.884 --> 03:16.875
Higgins, you got a minute?

03:19.055 --> 03:21.046
Actually, I don't.

03:23.092 --> 03:25.083
More war relics?

03:25.828 --> 03:28.626
Higgins, I didn't know you used swords
in your time.

03:28.664 --> 03:31.132
It's not a sword, Magnum, it's a foil.

03:31.167 --> 03:34.000
A Delinchi electrafoil, to be precise.

03:34.036 --> 03:37.403
- It's not for fighting, it's for fencing.
- You fence?

03:37.440 --> 03:40.273
I was considered
the Maître d'escrime at my school.

03:40.309 --> 03:42.903
- The what?
- The best.

03:43.486 --> 03:44.445
Of course.

03:44.470 --> 03:49.169
I've been invited to the Heidelberg
Class A fencing tournament at the club.

03:51.020 --> 03:53.318
That's my St Andrews regimental tie.

03:53.356 --> 03:57.315
Yes, I know. I picked it out.
I thought it went with my outfit.

03:57.360 --> 03:59.692
It does not go with anything of yours.

03:59.729 --> 04:02.197
What are you doing? Playing at dress-up?

04:02.231 --> 04:04.893
Carol has me back in court.
The Henderson case.

04:04.934 --> 04:08.062
- I'm her star witness.
- The poor girl must be desperate.

04:08.104 --> 04:12.336
Come on, Higgins, she's a great DA
and she said I was a great witness.

04:12.375 --> 04:15.833
- Her only witness. I wish her luck.
- Higgins, this is fascinating.

04:15.878 --> 04:20.247
This guy Henderson and his wife
opened up this wax museum by Pearl.

04:20.283 --> 04:23.047
They brought her sister in
as a silent partner.

04:23.085 --> 04:25.451
- Well, one thing led to another...
- Magnum.

04:25.488 --> 04:27.820
A month later, Mrs. H. Disappeared.

04:28.357 --> 04:30.518
- Guess where they found her.
- Magnum.

04:30.560 --> 04:33.028
- Come on, just guess.
- Take the tie and go.

04:34.197 --> 04:37.257
I was kind of hoping
you'd show me how to tie it.

04:37.300 --> 04:40.463
A grown man who doesn't know
how to tie his own tie?

04:40.503 --> 04:44.064
I know how to tie a tie,
but not one of your double Winslows.

04:44.106 --> 04:45.903
- Windsors.
- Windsors?

04:45.942 --> 04:48.843
- Is it over and under?
- Under your collar, broad side...

04:48.878 --> 04:52.143
- I've already done that.
- Put it over and under.

04:52.782 --> 04:54.545
Then over and under again.

04:55.818 --> 04:59.276
Then over and under again,
around the back and through.

04:59.322 --> 05:01.256
It's really quite simple.

05:02.391 --> 05:05.656
Now, if you don't mind,
I have a dozen things to do.

05:09.632 --> 05:12.897
- You wore this?
- With great pride.

05:12.935 --> 05:16.496
That cap is from one of the most prestigious
public schools in England.

05:16.539 --> 05:21.169
Put it on. Come on, Higgins.
I know you're dying to see how it looks.

05:22.812 --> 05:24.507
Goodbye, Magnum.

05:26.916 --> 05:28.907
Thanks for the knot.

06:43.426 --> 06:47.362
<i>It was good of you to come.
I couldn't tell you on the phone.</i>

06:48.631 --> 06:52.067
Willy was stationed in Croydon
while you were gone

06:52.902 --> 06:54.893
and we had tea now and then

06:56.639 --> 07:00.075
and before either of us knew
what was happening...

07:03.212 --> 07:05.339
Jonathan, we were married last month

07:05.381 --> 07:07.713
at the Troubshaw estate in Sussex.

07:09.318 --> 07:11.309
I'm so sorry.

07:12.555 --> 07:15.080
You'll always be very special to me,
Jonathan.

07:15.958 --> 07:19.416
Jonathan, it's really you.

07:20.463 --> 07:22.829
Are you all right?

07:22.865 --> 07:26.096
Yes. Yes, I'm quite well, thank you.

07:32.375 --> 07:37.540
I must have written and torn up
two dozen letters over the years,

07:38.748 --> 07:43.082
but now being here and so close
and not to write...

07:45.421 --> 07:48.447
- You don't mind that I wrote, Jonathan?
- Of course not.

07:48.491 --> 07:50.550
I'd have minded terribly if you hadn't.

07:53.195 --> 07:55.425
I tried to find tilling biscuits.

07:56.599 --> 08:01.298
Tilling biscuits?
Good Lor', that brings back memories.

08:01.337 --> 08:03.737
Tilling biscuits
and pomegranate marmalade.

08:03.773 --> 08:05.900
And rose petal tea.

08:08.177 --> 08:11.146
It's so very good to see you again, Jonathan.

08:16.719 --> 08:18.380
I um...

08:19.288 --> 08:23.190
I find myself rather nervous,
not being with you for so long.

08:24.560 --> 08:26.687
I remember the last time we were together.

08:27.663 --> 08:31.326
- That glorious summer day.
- June 17th.

08:32.368 --> 08:36.929
- Just after two in the afternoon.
- Yes. Just after two.

08:37.573 --> 08:39.803
Well, well, if it isn't Johnjohn.

08:40.075 --> 08:42.066
Long time, old nob.

08:42.111 --> 08:45.444
You're looking well. Well-fed, that is.

08:47.583 --> 08:50.950
I see you've been enjoying
each other's company.

08:51.921 --> 08:55.186
I contacted Jonathan
shortly after we arrived.

08:55.224 --> 08:58.250
- I thought it would be nice if we...
- Touched base?

08:58.294 --> 09:01.889
Everything is perfectly proper here,
as it has always been.

09:01.931 --> 09:06.334
- Relax, Johnjohn.
- Jonathan. As it has always been.

09:06.368 --> 09:09.804
I've more pressing matters on my mind
than a tryst.

09:12.575 --> 09:14.065
I think I'd better go.

09:14.743 --> 09:17.735
- Jonathan, please.
- Let him go, darling.

09:17.780 --> 09:22.444
I daresay he's got some preparing to do.
For the fencing tournament.

09:23.219 --> 09:25.414
I heard about it the moment I arrived.

09:25.454 --> 09:28.981
- I'd hoped to surprise you.
- Surprise me? How?

09:29.024 --> 09:33.688
I've entered the tournament
and drawn you in my first round.

09:34.396 --> 09:37.024
Quite a coincidence, wouldn't you say?

09:52.681 --> 09:57.050
Magnum, what feeds your neurotic need
to take things that don't belong to you?

09:57.086 --> 09:59.179
I don't know. Thirst, I guess.

09:59.889 --> 10:02.357
Thirst? How very amusing.

10:04.593 --> 10:09.860
Higgins, you have been practicing for over
three hours. Save something for tomorrow.

10:11.834 --> 10:15.201
I'm dying to see you in action.
What time's your match?

10:19.108 --> 10:21.201
Just about the time you normally retire.

10:21.944 --> 10:25.744
- Besides, it costs money to gain entrance.
- I know the guy at the door.

10:25.781 --> 10:28.011
I doubt you'd enjoy this, Magnum.

10:28.050 --> 10:31.417
No one is maimed, stomped,
blocked or clipped.

10:31.453 --> 10:34.684
Blood is not shed, bodies are not broken.
Very pedestrian.

10:34.723 --> 10:39.285
- Sounds interesting.
- Trust me, this really isn't your cup of tea.

10:41.163 --> 10:45.930
The wine cellar is open. There's a Pinot Noir
that doesn't demand much sophistication.

10:45.968 --> 10:49.096
I'm sure
you'll be quite comfortable with it. Lads.

10:51.774 --> 10:55.471
Higgins, you're offering me a bottle of wine?

10:56.211 --> 10:58.441
- Free?
- If you don't want it, just say so.

10:58.480 --> 11:00.471
No! No.

11:00.516 --> 11:04.077
I accept. Thank you very much.

11:04.119 --> 11:06.110
You're welcome.

11:15.931 --> 11:18.991
<i>Someone once said
there's no such thing as a free lunch.</i>

11:19.034 --> 11:22.936
<i>Higgins' bottle of wine wasn't exactly lunch,
but it wasn't free either.</i>

11:22.972 --> 11:26.533
<i>He obviously wanted me out of his hair,
last night and today.</i>

11:26.575 --> 11:28.839
<i>What I couldn't figure out was why</i>.

11:29.845 --> 11:32.746
<i>Then again, I wasn't sure
I wanted to find out.</i>

11:32.781 --> 11:35.545
<i>This was the first day in a week
I wasn't in court</i>

11:35.584 --> 11:37.745
<i>and I planned to take full advantage of it</i>.

11:37.786 --> 11:39.777
<i>Outside. On the beach</i>.

11:49.798 --> 11:54.758
<i>Match number three, foil,
will commence in three minutes.</i>

11:54.803 --> 11:57.966
<i>Fencing from the left position,
William Troubshaw.</i>

11:58.007 --> 12:01.602
<i>Fencing from the right position,
Jonathan Higgins.</i>

12:20.229 --> 12:23.528
Jonathan, I'm so sorry about yesterday.
About Willy.

12:23.565 --> 12:27.899
Velma, you have nothing to apologize for.
Absolutely nothing.

12:28.704 --> 12:31.298
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I am.

12:31.907 --> 12:35.274
Nicked my finger
polishing my foil this morning.

12:35.644 --> 12:37.874
Nothing serious.

12:37.913 --> 12:40.973
But thank you for your concern.

12:41.016 --> 12:44.110
There are some people I'd like you to meet.
This is Mr. Keeler.

12:44.153 --> 12:47.987
- He's a business associate of William's.
- How do you do?

12:48.390 --> 12:51.120
- That's quite a foil.
- Yes, a Delinchi.

12:52.995 --> 12:55.463
And this is my son Clarke.

12:58.667 --> 13:00.794
It's a great pleasure, Mr. Higgins.

13:00.836 --> 13:04.465
- My mother's spoken often of you.
- Very nice to meet you.

13:06.842 --> 13:09.106
You've asked for the left position?

13:09.144 --> 13:12.272
I don't care which side
or which weapon you've got, Johnjohn.

13:12.314 --> 13:15.374
I'm going to cut you to shreds
just as I always have.

13:15.417 --> 13:17.544
Shall we dispense with the weapons check?

13:17.586 --> 13:19.577
Oui, très bien.

13:56.225 --> 13:59.683
Touché left, one-zero.

14:03.999 --> 14:05.990
Touché left, two-zero.

14:23.852 --> 14:25.843
Touché left, three-zero.

14:45.574 --> 14:49.010
Touché left, four-zero.
Next touché is for the match.

15:42.412 --> 15:45.108
<i>Once, when I had measles,
my dad gave me a game book</i>

15:45.148 --> 15:48.640
<i>with one of those "What's wrong
with this picture?"puzzles inside.</i>

15:48.685 --> 15:51.313
<i>I found six things
before my dad stopped me.</i>

15:51.354 --> 15:54.949
<i>I was looking at the wrong page.
It was an ad for cocoa.</i>

15:54.991 --> 15:56.959
<i>Since then I've been real careful</i>

15:56.993 --> 16:00.326
<i>about looking for things to be wrong
where they shouldn't be.</i>

16:00.363 --> 16:04.493
<i>Like Higgins giving away something that was
part of his life since he was a kid.</i>

16:04.534 --> 16:06.627
<i>That's what's wrong with this picture</i>.

16:07.837 --> 16:10.533
- Hi, Higgins.
- Good morning, Magnum.

16:11.908 --> 16:15.275
I got the salve
that Doc Ibold prescribed for you.

16:15.879 --> 16:19.007
- You're supposed to use it twice a day.
- Fine.

16:21.551 --> 16:26.045
For three months I've done everything
to encourage this Waipai ginger to flower.

16:26.089 --> 16:28.080
I'd just about given up hope.

16:29.259 --> 16:32.626
I came out this morning
and found these blossoms.

16:34.264 --> 16:37.961
It's really quite fascinating
how these things happen.

16:38.001 --> 16:39.992
Just when you least expect it.

16:45.942 --> 16:47.933
Damn it, I'm not a cripple.

16:53.516 --> 16:56.417
- You all right?
- No, I'm not all right.

16:57.620 --> 17:00.555
Less than 24 hours ago
a man I've known for nearly 50 years

17:00.590 --> 17:03.388
died at my hand in front of his wife and son.

17:03.960 --> 17:09.159
Electrocuted, for God's sake. No,
Magnum, I most certainly am not all right.

17:09.898 --> 17:13.198
Higgins, it was an accident.
You can't blame yourself.

17:18.508 --> 17:20.976
For all the years that I've known him,

17:22.412 --> 17:27.849
Willy Troubshaw was a self-centered,
egotistical, hateful and brutal bully...

17:28.484 --> 17:30.476
to everyone.

17:31.321 --> 17:35.553
He took from me
things that were... irreplaceable.

17:38.228 --> 17:41.288
There have been many occasions
when I wished he were dead.

17:41.331 --> 17:44.300
As distasteful as that may sound, it's true.

17:45.802 --> 17:47.793
Now suddenly he is dead.

17:48.671 --> 17:50.662
I don't quite know how to feel.

17:53.810 --> 17:58.144
I can only hope
that there is some purpose in this.

18:00.817 --> 18:02.808
Some reason.

18:10.193 --> 18:13.185
The reason's simple.
Somebody wanted Troubshaw dead.

18:13.229 --> 18:14.992
Come on, Rick, it was an accident.

18:15.031 --> 18:18.865
- Two sevens.
- Something like this sure makes you think.

18:18.902 --> 18:23.396
The day before yesterday Troubshaw
was in my office trying to charter a chopper.

18:23.439 --> 18:27.239
- Then someone's offed him.
- Higgins didn't off him. Three fours.

18:27.277 --> 18:29.905
I said someone. You said Higgins.

18:30.580 --> 18:34.539
A lot of people heard Higgins
ask for the right side. Why? Three fives.

18:34.584 --> 18:36.518
Habit, maybe. You know how Higgins is.

18:36.553 --> 18:38.851
He also waived the weapons check. Why?

18:38.888 --> 18:43.621
Maybe it was some kind of fencing courtesy.
Three fours and two sevens.

18:44.260 --> 18:48.253
- None of this proves anything.
- We're not trying to prove anything.

18:48.298 --> 18:52.928
But it might to the cops. They were here
all last night asking questions. Four sevens.

18:52.969 --> 18:55.529
Well, that's their job, isn't it? Five sevens.

18:55.572 --> 18:58.302
I hope you got 'em all cos I don't have any.

18:59.742 --> 19:01.733
I got one.

19:05.114 --> 19:09.073
T.C., when Troubshaw tried to charter
your chopper, where did he want to go?

19:09.118 --> 19:13.384
Never got to that. I told him I was booked,
he was in a hurry and he split.

19:13.423 --> 19:15.891
Well, then, he tried to hire somebody else.

19:15.925 --> 19:19.884
T.C., why don't you check around, find out who
took him out and where he went?

19:19.929 --> 19:23.888
Thomas, I'm up to my ears coaching
the peewees. We got playoffs next week.

19:23.933 --> 19:26.834
We ran some pretty interesting stuff
at the Academy.

19:26.869 --> 19:30.236
We beat Army two out of three years.
I tell you what.

19:30.273 --> 19:34.733
You help me with Troubshaw, I'll show up
at the field and run some plays with the kids.

19:34.777 --> 19:37.177
Thomas, the Academy was ages ago.

19:41.184 --> 19:43.175
It's like riding a bicycle, Rick.

19:43.219 --> 19:44.982
You never forget.

19:45.021 --> 19:47.717
What do you say, T.C.? Deal?

19:52.929 --> 19:54.920
They're lovely.

19:56.299 --> 19:58.130
It's so quiet now.

19:58.167 --> 20:03.070
I'd gotten used to hearing Willy's voice
booming over everything and everyone.

20:03.106 --> 20:04.767
Velma, I...

20:05.408 --> 20:09.003
I can't tell you how badly I feel
about what happened.

20:09.712 --> 20:12.408
You mustn't torture yourself, Jonathan.

20:12.448 --> 20:15.474
Our greatest responsibility now
is to go on living.

20:18.388 --> 20:23.621
- You are a truly remarkable woman.
- Not, Jonathan. Not really.

20:27.330 --> 20:29.321
How is Clarke holding up?

20:31.968 --> 20:36.064
It won't be so easy.
Clarke always was my baby.

20:36.706 --> 20:41.166
With Willy gone so often I raised him
almost completely by myself.

20:42.078 --> 20:45.980
I hoped I could protect him
against that horrible, awful man.

20:48.184 --> 20:50.345
- Velma.
- It's true, Jonathan.

20:51.621 --> 20:54.818
I can't go on like this, pretending to mourn.

20:54.857 --> 20:57.951
Willy was a tyrant
and I should have left him long ago.

20:59.996 --> 21:04.626
Over the years I grew to hate him
as much as I know you always did.

21:05.968 --> 21:07.868
But unlike you,

21:10.106 --> 21:13.075
I lacked the courage
to do anything about it.

21:14.077 --> 21:15.908
Velma, what are you saying?

21:15.945 --> 21:20.439
Jonathan, you've given me back my life.

21:22.418 --> 21:24.648
You've set me free.

21:42.105 --> 21:44.164
- Hi, Carol.
- What's with you?

21:45.375 --> 21:47.900
It's nothing. I just got a little banged up.

21:48.845 --> 21:50.836
What happened?

21:50.880 --> 21:54.475
I've been working out
with this football team T.C. coaches.

21:54.517 --> 21:56.508
- Must have been rough.
- Yeah.

21:56.552 --> 21:58.918
- Was it semi-pro?
- No.

22:00.123 --> 22:01.954
High school?

22:01.991 --> 22:03.925
- Peewee.
- What?

22:05.395 --> 22:07.386
Peewee.

22:08.898 --> 22:11.992
- They're state champs.
- Oh. Uh-huh.

22:14.904 --> 22:16.895
What are you doing here, Thomas?

22:16.939 --> 22:19.806
We're not due back in court
till next week.

22:19.909 --> 22:23.436
Well, it's kind of funny.
I've been coming here so often

22:23.479 --> 22:27.973
that I guess I automatically head
in this direction every morning.

22:28.017 --> 22:30.144
Maybe we should start a car pool.

22:31.988 --> 22:36.391
Well, lunch is over and I've got work to do.
Take care of yourself, Thomas.

22:36.426 --> 22:38.394
I know a good Pop Warner league, if...

22:38.428 --> 22:40.362
Carol,

22:40.396 --> 22:42.387
I need some information.

22:43.900 --> 22:45.891
What kind of information?

22:46.436 --> 22:48.267
The Troubshaw investigation.

22:51.040 --> 22:54.601
- There is an investigation, isn't there?
- Is there?

22:54.644 --> 22:58.239
Come on. I know the police
have been asking questions.

22:59.248 --> 23:01.239
Sorry, Thomas, I can't talk about it.

23:01.284 --> 23:06.483
Carol, yes, you can.
Just tell me what's developing.

23:07.723 --> 23:10.123
- Sorry. No.
- Carol!

23:10.159 --> 23:13.287
You dragged me into court four times
on the Henderson case.

23:13.329 --> 23:16.059
I should be billing your office. Come on.

23:17.233 --> 23:20.225
All right. I saw the evidence report.

23:20.269 --> 23:22.100
And?

23:22.138 --> 23:26.438
The scoring box had been tampered with.
It was hotter than an electric chair.

23:27.176 --> 23:29.007
- Prints?
- Lots of them.

23:29.045 --> 23:31.775
And there were traces of blood
inside the box.

23:32.882 --> 23:35.544
Blood in the box. So whoever...

23:35.585 --> 23:38.281
was rigging the box
probably cut himself.

23:39.856 --> 23:41.881
Oh, Thomas, I'm sorry.

23:41.924 --> 23:45.519
Sorry? Sorry for what?
You keep saying you're sorry.

24:02.610 --> 24:05.636
<i>It was definitely not
one of my better days in paradise.</i>

24:05.679 --> 24:08.011
<i>As a private investigator, I've spent time</i>

24:08.048 --> 24:11.142
<i>in courtrooms and jail cells
and prisoner waiting rooms,</i>

24:11.185 --> 24:13.176
<i>but not like today</i>.

24:16.690 --> 24:18.681
Higgins.

24:18.726 --> 24:21.058
- You all right?
- Really, Magnum,

24:22.096 --> 24:25.759
you must learn to retain
your dignity and composure under stress.

24:25.799 --> 24:27.767
I'm not under stress.

24:28.502 --> 24:31.300
Good. I'm glad to hear it.

24:34.842 --> 24:38.107
How are they treating you?
Do you need anything?

24:39.013 --> 24:41.481
I see you've been watching
the late show again.

24:43.484 --> 24:47.944
Higgins, I don't understand you.
Why didn't you call Robin's attorney?

24:47.988 --> 24:49.751
I have an attorney.

24:49.790 --> 24:53.817
Oh, yeah. Yeah, an overworked,
underpaid public defender

24:53.861 --> 24:56.261
who'll be lucky if he can get you out on bail.

24:57.031 --> 25:01.559
- Are you deliberately trying to blow this?
- Of course not, Magnum.

25:01.602 --> 25:04.662
I've been in jails
that make this look like summer camp.

25:04.705 --> 25:09.267
I once spent almost a month
in a three-by-six cell outside Calcutta.

25:09.309 --> 25:14.474
Three-quarters of my daily rice ration went
to the rats that occupied the cell with me.

25:14.515 --> 25:17.507
A strangely symbiotic relationship,
nevertheless...

25:17.551 --> 25:19.542
Higgins, shut up.

25:25.559 --> 25:28.323
Now, listen to me. Please.

25:32.499 --> 25:34.490
That scoring box was rigged.

25:35.769 --> 25:40.172
Whoever did it made sure Troubshaw lit up
when you touched him with your sword.

25:40.207 --> 25:43.040
- Foil.
- Foil, whatever.

25:43.077 --> 25:45.477
Your fingerprints are apparently all over it.

25:46.847 --> 25:49.179
Well, of course they're all over it.

25:49.216 --> 25:52.481
I always check the box
to make sure it's operating properly.

25:52.519 --> 25:55.920
That's terrific. The DA will love to hear that.

25:58.425 --> 26:01.826
Magnum, all of this is purely circumstantial.

26:01.862 --> 26:06.822
If I'd wanted to kill Willy, I could have chosen
a hundred more discreet ways to do it.

26:06.867 --> 26:11.099
Besides, a motive is usually
a sine qua non in a murder case.

26:12.740 --> 26:14.901
I haven't seen Willy Troubshaw in 40 years.

26:14.942 --> 26:18.400
- Why would I want to kill him?
- Velma.

26:20.347 --> 26:23.145
Velma Troubshaw has nothing to do with this.

26:23.183 --> 26:25.743
- How dare you even suggest...
- Higgins.

26:25.786 --> 26:30.689
She was one of the things that
Troubshaw took away from you, wasn't she?

26:31.492 --> 26:35.622
I will not dignify that with an answer.
My personal life is my own business.

26:35.662 --> 26:37.653
Not in court.

26:40.234 --> 26:43.761
Higgins... you need help.

26:44.805 --> 26:47.797
I'm not one of your clients, Magnum.
Stay out of this!

26:58.886 --> 27:00.911
- Keep me out of this.
- Come on, T.C.

27:00.954 --> 27:03.821
What's a little ride out to Walakana Sugar?

27:03.857 --> 27:06.189
Busted throttle linkage, that's what.

27:06.226 --> 27:09.753
All right, how about driving out there
with me in the Ferrari?

27:09.797 --> 27:13.164
Are you crazy? Those people
aren't known for their hospitality.

27:13.200 --> 27:15.430
They're not? How come?

27:16.670 --> 27:20.902
All I know is a chopper pilot friend of mine said
those people out there are weird.

27:20.941 --> 27:26.277
Chopper pilots think you're weird unless you
have a propeller on your beanie. Come on!

27:26.313 --> 27:29.441
Every time I go somewhere with you
I end up in a mess of trouble.

27:29.483 --> 27:33.476
Besides, what does Walakana Sugar
have to do with Higgins offing that guy?

27:33.520 --> 27:36.921
- Higgins didn't off him.
- Well, he sure didn't help him.

27:36.957 --> 27:40.449
T.C., the Troubshaw family
owns Walakana Sugar.

27:40.494 --> 27:44.453
William's brother Andrew ran the place
till he died a couple of months ago.

27:44.498 --> 27:47.433
Troubshaw came to Oahu
to check the place out.

27:47.467 --> 27:52.495
- So you gotta do the same thing?
- What else? Higgins is sitting in jail.

28:03.350 --> 28:05.341
I still don't like it.

28:20.234 --> 28:22.225
Hey, where's the office?

28:34.848 --> 28:37.976
- I told you, they're weird.
- No, they're not.

28:39.019 --> 28:41.010
Hi, guys.

28:42.122 --> 28:45.649
- They're weird.
- I think we've worn out our welcome.

28:47.461 --> 28:50.089
What could these guys
possibly have against us?

28:50.898 --> 28:54.095
- T.C., my finger.
- You should have thought about that.

29:04.678 --> 29:06.669
Hold it! Hold it!

29:08.582 --> 29:12.541
You guys got nothing better to do
on your break? Maybe we ought to cut it out.

29:14.354 --> 29:18.723
Next time you want to inspect the plant,
call ahead for permission. Get out of here.

29:18.759 --> 29:20.590
Wait a minute.

29:20.627 --> 29:24.791
- Why would we want to inspect the plant?
- You wouldn't unless you wanted to buy it.

29:24.831 --> 29:28.164
- You trying to unload it?
- No, I'm not, but the Troubshaws are.

29:28.201 --> 29:30.897
My name's Keeler. I'm the plant manager.

29:30.938 --> 29:33.372
- T.C.
- Thomas Magnum.

29:34.608 --> 29:36.166
What can I do for you?

29:36.677 --> 29:39.168
- We're here about Troubshaw's death.
- Police?

29:39.212 --> 29:41.043
- Yeah.
- No.

29:41.081 --> 29:45.381
- Which is it?
- He's a private investigator.

29:45.419 --> 29:47.410
And a friend of Jonathan Higgins.

29:47.454 --> 29:49.922
That's where I know you. The tournament.

29:49.957 --> 29:52.391
Keeler, what in God's name
is going on here?

29:52.426 --> 29:54.553
Some of the boys thought they were buyers.

29:54.594 --> 29:57.188
You treat buyers like this, you'll never sell it.

29:57.230 --> 29:59.221
We'll sell it all right.

30:00.233 --> 30:03.396
I'd better get back inside.
Sorry about the mistake.

30:03.437 --> 30:06.338
I've got some ice for that.
It's back in my office.

30:06.373 --> 30:08.170
- Come on, T.C.
- Uh-uh.

30:08.208 --> 30:12.941
I think my chances will be better out here with
the Ferrari... with the engine running.

30:13.880 --> 30:15.871
This way.

30:20.020 --> 30:23.649
You can't blame the men. Most of them have
worked here all their lives.

30:23.690 --> 30:25.681
Go on.

30:25.726 --> 30:28.661
They're actually trying
to buy the place themselves.

30:28.695 --> 30:31.027
Not having much luck at it, though.

30:31.064 --> 30:36.502
Trying to keep this place running
is like trying to breathe life into a dinosaur.

30:37.904 --> 30:40.464
Keeler's doing the best he can, but...

30:41.875 --> 30:44.173
costs are going up, profits are going down.

30:45.312 --> 30:47.177
That's what killed my Uncle Andrew.

30:47.714 --> 30:50.740
If you sell to someone else,
what'll happen to the mill?

30:52.386 --> 30:54.217
They'll probably bulldoze it.

30:55.589 --> 30:59.855
- And the men?
- Why should they care about the men?

30:59.893 --> 31:03.954
- I take it you don't.
- That's not true. Of course I do.

31:04.664 --> 31:06.655
Your father?

31:07.968 --> 31:11.165
I suppose. I can't really tell you for sure.

31:13.040 --> 31:17.443
You see, my father and I were not exactly
what you would call close.

31:18.311 --> 31:20.836
That's the beauty
of the boarding school system.

31:20.881 --> 31:24.476
It keeps nonexistent relationships civilized.

31:26.386 --> 31:28.286
He was gonna sell the mill...

31:28.321 --> 31:31.518
Before he was murdered
by your friend, Mr. Higgins.

31:31.558 --> 31:33.651
Higgins did not kill your father.

31:33.693 --> 31:37.026
I should say that's for a jury to decide.

31:37.064 --> 31:40.033
I get the feeling you don't care
one way or the other.

31:42.903 --> 31:47.067
I'll be honest with you.
I'm not the least bit sorry he's dead.

31:48.675 --> 31:50.905
He was a difficult man, my father.

31:52.779 --> 31:57.239
He was arrogant and cold

31:59.019 --> 32:01.681
and he brutalized my mother.

32:03.390 --> 32:06.018
But he was my father

32:07.327 --> 32:11.457
and I don't feel comfortable
chitchatting with a friend of his killer.

32:19.539 --> 32:21.530
Thanks for the ice.

32:45.432 --> 32:47.764
Velma? Is that you?

32:51.104 --> 32:53.163
I sent the note.

32:54.274 --> 32:55.832
You're alive.

32:57.444 --> 33:01.244
I'm sorry to have caused you
all the inconvenience, Jonathan,

33:01.281 --> 33:05.047
but I couldn't resist having you on
for old times' sake.

33:05.552 --> 33:08.385
It was good sport,
especially in front of Velma.

33:09.222 --> 33:12.783
But it's over now, Johnjohn.
Shall we shake, to friendship?

33:27.607 --> 33:29.802
No! No!

33:32.546 --> 33:34.537
Higgins!

33:39.519 --> 33:42.249
Ow! Higgins, are you all right?

33:42.289 --> 33:44.723
- More appropriately, are you?
- Ahh!

33:44.758 --> 33:47.750
Another torrid night
at the Boom Boom Room, I presume?

33:47.794 --> 33:51.252
I banged my finger on the knob.
I heard you yelling.

33:52.165 --> 33:56.067
I may have been chuckling out loud.
Noël Coward is such a delight.

34:00.340 --> 34:04.003
- What is it, Magnum?
- Higgins, who are you trying to protect?

34:04.044 --> 34:06.478
Don't be preposterous.

34:06.513 --> 34:10.643
I don't care if you are protecting someone
as long as you protect yourself too.

34:11.551 --> 34:15.510
Unless British honor demands you get
convicted of a crime you didn't commit.

34:15.554 --> 34:20.049
Magnum, your understanding of honor is
as solid as Attila the Hun's grasp of morality.

34:20.092 --> 34:22.186
I'd like to finish my book.

34:22.228 --> 34:25.322
That public defender got you out on bail

34:25.364 --> 34:29.768
but he's just gonna add you to his list
of 55 other cases, Higgins.

34:30.370 --> 34:32.360
Higgins!

34:38.812 --> 34:41.280
Noël Coward's even better
when you can read him.

34:50.623 --> 34:54.650
If it will keep you from barging
into my bedroom at all hours of the night,

34:54.694 --> 34:57.663
I'll call Mr. Masters' attorneys tomorrow.

35:09.643 --> 35:12.203
<i>My favorite time in paradise is the morning</i>.

35:12.445 --> 35:14.970
<i>Regardless of what happened
the day before,</i>

35:15.014 --> 35:19.144
<i>everything seems fresh and clean
and ready for a brand-new start.</i>

35:19.185 --> 35:21.949
<i>After my conversation with Higgins
the night before,</i>

35:21.988 --> 35:24.548
<i>I felt like we were finally
making some progress,</i>

35:24.591 --> 35:27.458
<i>that something really good was happening</i>.

35:27.961 --> 35:30.862
<i>Of course, I'd been wrong before</i>.

35:32.532 --> 35:35.968
I don't suppose
you were just in the neighborhood.

35:36.336 --> 35:38.327
I didn't want to phone.

35:39.906 --> 35:41.897
- Peewees?
- What?

35:42.642 --> 35:45.042
Oh. Uh... It's a long story.

35:47.180 --> 35:50.616
Well, you want the good news
or the not-so-good news?

35:51.017 --> 35:53.008
Your choice.

35:53.052 --> 35:57.250
The good news is that you're off the hook
as far as the Henderson case goes.

35:57.290 --> 35:59.087
They settled out of court.

35:59.125 --> 36:00.956
What's the bad news?

36:00.994 --> 36:05.294
Mrs. Troubshaw came to my office yesterday.
We talked for nearly three hours.

36:05.331 --> 36:07.162
And?

36:07.200 --> 36:12.638
She told me that Jonathan Higgins as good
as confessed that he killed her husband.

36:23.431 --> 36:26.400
Higgins, I don't think this is such a good idea.

36:26.434 --> 36:29.028
I see no other way of handling the matter.

36:29.070 --> 36:31.231
It could make things a lot worse.

36:31.339 --> 36:35.469
Magnum, all things considered,
I fail to see how things could get worse.

36:35.510 --> 36:39.071
- I'll go with you to Mrs. Troubshaw's.
- You'll do nothing of the kind.

36:39.113 --> 36:42.514
I've told you before,
this is my personal business.

36:46.988 --> 36:49.388
However I am not ungrateful
for your concern.

36:49.424 --> 36:51.654
Of course I'm concerned, Higgins.

36:51.692 --> 36:53.922
We're talking murder, remember?

37:11.913 --> 37:15.314
- What the devil do you want?
- I want to talk to your mother.

37:16.184 --> 37:19.051
- You can't be serious.
- I most certainly am.

37:19.587 --> 37:21.578
It's all right, Clarke.

37:27.528 --> 37:29.519
Velma.

37:30.598 --> 37:34.534
I'm sorry to intrude, but we must talk.

37:36.370 --> 37:38.930
I had to tell them the truth, Jonathan.

37:38.973 --> 37:40.964
I want you to tell me the truth.

37:44.445 --> 37:46.436
That you hated Willy.

37:49.050 --> 37:51.518
When you came to see me you told me

37:51.552 --> 37:55.545
that you suddenly had the courage
to do something about it.

37:55.590 --> 37:59.287
And that's what you told
the assistant district attorney?

37:59.327 --> 38:01.795
- Yes.
- But why?

38:03.097 --> 38:05.759
Leave her alone.
Haven't you hurt her enough?

38:05.800 --> 38:08.792
On the contrary, I've done
everything I could to protect her.

38:11.005 --> 38:14.771
To protect me? Why?

38:14.809 --> 38:16.470
For what?

38:19.313 --> 38:21.508
My God, Jonathan. You think I killed him?

38:22.984 --> 38:25.714
I'm afraid
I haven't quite known what to think.

38:27.388 --> 38:30.687
- No, Jonathan.
- You lied to the district attorney. Why?

38:30.725 --> 38:33.990
What possible reason
could you have unless...

38:38.633 --> 38:41.796
What's going on?
Why are you both looking at me like that?

38:44.972 --> 38:46.371
Mother.

38:50.177 --> 38:52.168
You think I did it?

38:54.282 --> 38:58.412
I watched him intimidate and patronize you
over the years.

38:58.452 --> 39:02.013
My heart went out to you
but there was nothing I could do for you.

39:03.457 --> 39:07.188
So I thought that maybe
you had decided to do something.

39:08.162 --> 39:11.928
No. No, I hated Father too much to kill him.

39:13.267 --> 39:15.258
It's true, Mother.

39:15.303 --> 39:18.568
Why should I waste my life for him?

39:20.107 --> 39:22.098
He would have in your place.

39:22.143 --> 39:27.342
Mother... maybe I carry his blood

39:29.150 --> 39:30.617
but I carry yours as well.

39:33.621 --> 39:35.919
I could no more kill him than you could.

39:47.201 --> 39:52.161
Jonathan, the only person
I could sacrifice you for

39:52.873 --> 39:54.864
would be my son.

39:55.843 --> 39:57.834
And I'm so ashamed.

40:00.147 --> 40:02.172
Forgive me. Let me make it up to you.

40:02.216 --> 40:06.118
I'll go to the district attorney
and I'll explain and they'll understand.

40:06.153 --> 40:08.815
- Thank you.
- Oh, Jonathan.

40:08.856 --> 40:11.188
It's all right, Velma. Truly.

40:11.859 --> 40:15.556
I'm very grateful that whoever killed Willy,

40:17.131 --> 40:19.122
it wasn't one of us.

40:19.634 --> 40:21.795
- Then who?
- It doesn't matter.

40:23.004 --> 40:27.703
It does matter! If you were covering
for Velma and she was covering for Clarke,

40:27.742 --> 40:29.573
you're the prime suspect again.

40:29.610 --> 40:31.976
- It's not important.
- It is important!

40:32.013 --> 40:36.109
What is important is that a friendship I value
has not been betrayed.

40:36.150 --> 40:40.246
- I would hope you could understand that.
- Great! Wonderful!

40:40.287 --> 40:44.621
What I do understand is someone
is running around out there free as a bird

40:44.659 --> 40:47.856
- and you're doing your bills...
- Robin Masters' bills.

40:49.096 --> 40:51.087
Higgins, you're not off the hook.

40:51.132 --> 40:53.464
Magnum, I am innocent.

40:53.501 --> 40:55.492
You know that, I know that.

40:55.536 --> 40:59.495
Velma Troubshaw, for whom I have
more than considerable regard, knows that

40:59.540 --> 41:03.874
and I am certain that whoever killed Willy,
it was not Velma or her son.

41:03.911 --> 41:07.210
- Then who?
- That's a matter for the proper authorities.

41:14.655 --> 41:16.646
Let's see...

41:17.358 --> 41:20.225
It had to be someone
with motive and opportunity.

41:20.261 --> 41:24.527
- And access, access to the club.
- That narrows it down to a mere few score.

41:24.565 --> 41:28.501
And it had to be someone with knowledge
of the tournament and the schedules.

41:28.536 --> 41:30.697
Now you've got it down to a few dozen.

41:30.738 --> 41:34.799
And it had to be someone who knew
about fencing and a little bit about wiring.

41:56.931 --> 42:00.731
<i>I know what you're thinking.
That was kind of a quick jump in logic.</i>

42:00.768 --> 42:03.794
<i>But sometimes
you just gotta go with a hunch.</i>

42:04.305 --> 42:08.139
<i>On the other hand
it's sometimes wise to think things out.</i>

42:08.175 --> 42:12.134
<i>I could have called the police or Carol.
Of course, that would have been easy.</i>

42:12.179 --> 42:15.273
<i>The only thing was,
I didn't have any hard evidence</i>

42:15.316 --> 42:18.149
<i>so I had to hope
that Keeler would listen to reason.</i>

42:18.185 --> 42:20.517
<i>Except the higher and higher I got,</i>

42:21.455 --> 42:24.720
<i>the less and less I was convinced
that that would be the case</i>

42:24.759 --> 42:26.750
<i>and the more and more convinced I became</i>

42:26.794 --> 42:29.957
<i>that this was the dumbest move I'd made
in quite a long time.</i>

42:29.997 --> 42:31.988
This is dumb, Magnum.

42:32.032 --> 42:34.933
You could break your neck up here.
It's dangerous.

42:34.969 --> 42:36.800
It's dangerous down there too.

42:36.837 --> 42:40.534
Yeah. The whole mill's like that
if you don't know what you're doing.

42:40.574 --> 42:45.068
- Like a fencing match?
- You're standing on treacherous footing.

42:46.413 --> 42:49.314
Yeah, I know. So is the mill.

42:49.917 --> 42:52.886
Willy Troubshaw was gonna sell it
out from under you.

42:52.920 --> 42:58.051
- State your business, Magnum.
- I'm just looking for Troubshaw's killer.

42:58.092 --> 43:00.083
- He's out on bail.
- Higgins?

43:01.762 --> 43:04.094
Well, maybe he had a reason to kill him.

43:04.131 --> 43:07.760
But so did a lot of other people.
Including you.

43:09.537 --> 43:11.903
You came up here to tell me I killed him?

43:11.939 --> 43:14.635
You tell me. You're right-handed.

43:14.675 --> 43:18.441
At the tournament you shook hands
with your left. Fencers do that.

43:19.046 --> 43:21.674
I see you know a little bit about wiring.

43:21.715 --> 43:26.379
It'd be real interesting to see if the blood type
in the scoring box matches yours.

43:26.420 --> 43:29.253
- Magnum...
- We can wrestle around up here.

43:29.290 --> 43:31.281
Maybe get ourselves hurt.

43:31.892 --> 43:34.656
Or you can come into town
and do some explaining.

43:37.064 --> 43:39.055
What do you say, Keeler?

43:42.570 --> 43:45.232
OK. Let's go, Magnum.

43:47.141 --> 43:49.132
- You know something?
- What?

43:49.176 --> 43:51.667
This is crazy. I'm not going.

44:17.104 --> 44:19.095
Enough. Enough.

44:21.942 --> 44:23.933
Aaargh!

44:29.516 --> 44:31.677
That was a lovely tea, Jonathan.

44:32.219 --> 44:34.187
It was entirely my pleasure.

44:36.357 --> 44:38.348
I've missed afternoon tea.

44:43.063 --> 44:44.724
What's this?

44:46.000 --> 44:47.991
Tilling biscuits.

44:49.270 --> 44:51.966
- Where did you ever...
- Family secret.

44:56.844 --> 45:01.747
I've spent so many years thinking of you
and what I might do if I were free.

45:03.784 --> 45:04.944
So have I.

45:05.786 --> 45:11.224
And now with everything that's happened,
I... feel that we're further apart than ever.

45:11.258 --> 45:15.820
We've never been far apart.
We never shall be.

45:15.863 --> 45:19.094
- You forgive me, Jonathan?
- Of course.

45:38.485 --> 45:41.147
Would you look in on Clarke at the mill
now and again?

45:41.188 --> 45:44.749
- He's going to try to make a go of it.
- I'd be very glad to.

45:44.792 --> 45:46.783
Thank you.

46:28.102 --> 46:30.093
Higgins!

46:30.504 --> 46:32.836
You won't believe this. Come here.

46:33.907 --> 46:36.375
I was out shopping at the thrift store

46:37.978 --> 46:39.969
and look what I came across.

46:41.315 --> 46:45.911
Ta-da! Your Delinchi.
Isn't that a coincidence?

46:45.953 --> 46:47.784
Yes.

46:47.821 --> 46:52.622
Well, I was just out looking for some pants
to make into cut-offs and...

46:53.727 --> 46:56.628
Oh, shoot, I don't have any use
for this kind of thing,

46:56.663 --> 47:00.394
I just thought
maybe you should have it back.

47:03.404 --> 47:05.395
Thank you, Magnum.

47:05.439 --> 47:08.306
Let me at least reimburse you
for what you paid for it.

47:08.342 --> 47:10.173
No, that's not necessary.

47:12.146 --> 47:14.706
Well, may I offer you
something in exchange?

47:15.816 --> 47:18.785
Higgins,
I want you to listen to me very carefully.

47:18.819 --> 47:22.482
There is absolutely nothing I want
in return for that sword.

47:23.190 --> 47:25.385
- Foil.
- Foil.

47:28.729 --> 47:33.325
- Thank you, Magnum, that's very nice.
- You're welcome.

47:42.810 --> 47:44.801
Oh, Higgins.

47:44.845 --> 47:47.109
There is something we can negotiate for.

47:50.584 --> 47:52.575
What?
