00:38.639 --> 00:40.841
While conditions for women
have improved in the West,

00:40.874 --> 00:43.677
Here in Ganzar,
they're among the worst
in the world.

00:43.711 --> 00:46.480
It's no exaggeration
to say that these women

00:46.514 --> 00:49.183
Live their lives
essentially as slaves.

00:49.217 --> 00:51.152
[Static]
Am I still on air?

00:51.185 --> 00:52.420
Damn!

00:52.453 --> 00:53.821
MAN: I'm sure
reception
will improve

00:53.854 --> 00:55.523
Once we get
out of this pass,
Ms. Prescott.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.125
No. I mean, do we
think the warlords

00:57.158 --> 00:58.659
Are gonna put
their guns down

00:58.692 --> 01:00.294
Just because I'm here
for an election-year
photo op?

01:00.328 --> 01:01.862
We're wasting our time.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.232
It only takes
one pebble to start
an avalanche.

01:04.265 --> 01:06.367
Thanks,
Agent Fortune Cookie.

01:10.138 --> 01:12.240
What the he is this?

01:12.273 --> 01:14.475
Reynolds.
Camelot One to Camelot Two.

01:14.508 --> 01:15.609
What's the holdup?

01:15.643 --> 01:18.512
I'll take care of it
in a second.

01:18.546 --> 01:19.780
We gotta move this cart.

01:22.550 --> 01:24.318
Jones is down!

01:28.656 --> 01:30.424
He's got a gun!
Get down!

01:32.226 --> 01:33.561
[Gasps]

01:33.594 --> 01:34.828
[Screams]

01:39.267 --> 01:40.401
[Gunfire]

01:48.442 --> 01:49.743
Webber,
get Elise to safety!

02:00.588 --> 02:02.290
Elise, you okay?
Think I'm okay.

02:02.323 --> 02:04.492
I'm activating
the homing beacon
in your watch.

02:04.525 --> 02:05.893
You can run due east.

02:05.926 --> 02:08.395
Someone will be by to get you
within 30 minutes!

02:08.429 --> 02:09.396
You're coming with me,
aren't you?

02:09.430 --> 02:10.764
I gotta cover you! Go!

02:22.876 --> 02:24.678
[Gasps]

02:26.747 --> 02:28.682
[Gasping]

02:35.223 --> 02:37.325
I like your watch.

02:37.358 --> 02:39.193
May I see it?

02:40.361 --> 02:41.795
Get up.

02:44.532 --> 02:45.866
You can imagine
what can happen

02:45.899 --> 02:47.901
To a pretty thing like you
in these mountains.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.737
What are you
gonna do to me?

02:49.770 --> 02:53.907
Heh. That depends
on the President
of the United States,

02:53.941 --> 02:55.876
Or, as you call him,

02:55.909 --> 02:56.877
Daddy.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.779
[Chuckles]

02:58.812 --> 02:59.747
Move.

03:04.685 --> 03:07.187
[Telephone rings]
[Cellphone buzzes]

03:10.758 --> 03:11.925
Kendall.

03:13.961 --> 03:15.263
When?

03:16.830 --> 03:18.766
I'll be there
in 10 minutes.

03:20.901 --> 03:22.403
Woman: Put me up to speed.

03:22.436 --> 03:24.238
Two hours ago,
the First Daughter's
convoy

03:24.272 --> 03:25.473
Was hit by militants
in the mountains
near Ganzar province.

03:27.675 --> 03:28.976
Approximately
30 minutes ago,

03:29.009 --> 03:30.911
The White House
received that
via email.

03:30.944 --> 03:34.515
Hello, Mr. President
and presumably members

03:34.548 --> 03:36.784
Of the U.S.
intelligence agencies.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.786
You may call me Ulrika,

03:38.819 --> 03:41.955
Though I assume you have
a thorough dossier already.

03:41.989 --> 03:47.961
But I want you to say hello
to my new houseguest.

03:47.995 --> 03:50.898
I will make you
a simple offer.

03:52.466 --> 03:55.035
My country is in disarray.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.337
It's fractured.

03:57.938 --> 04:01.041
We need a strong leader
to unite it,

04:01.074 --> 04:02.976
And that leader
shall be me.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.845
But I need your help.

04:04.878 --> 04:07.481
I ask of the U.S.

04:07.515 --> 04:09.783
To liberate my country
from its shackles,

04:09.817 --> 04:12.586
Eliminate the rivals,
pretenders to the throne,

04:12.620 --> 04:16.055
And install me
as the legitimate President.

04:16.089 --> 04:19.860
You do this,
and I will become

04:19.892 --> 04:26.900
A very, very good friend
to America.

04:26.934 --> 04:31.805
You've got 48 hours from
the receipt of this email.

04:31.839 --> 04:34.475
Do not play me for the fool.

04:34.508 --> 04:37.711
If I see as much
as one drone,

04:37.745 --> 04:39.680
One G.I. footprint
in the dirt,

04:39.713 --> 04:43.417
Then I'll start mailing
pieces of her

04:43.451 --> 04:45.486
Back to you.

04:46.754 --> 04:47.788
Ohh.

04:47.821 --> 04:50.624
Even such grotesque things

04:50.658 --> 04:52.393
Are of great value

04:52.426 --> 04:55.329
To any number
of America's enemies.

04:55.363 --> 04:56.597
Holy fuck.

04:58.065 --> 04:59.767
Yeah, that about
says it.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.402
[Sighs]
Tell me the President

05:01.435 --> 05:03.371
Is nowhere near
the Situation Room.

05:03.404 --> 05:04.372
Oh, he wants blood,

05:04.405 --> 05:05.606
But has
recused himself.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.074
Now, as far as the press
is concerned,

05:07.107 --> 05:08.609
He's going through
a routine medical procedure.

05:08.642 --> 05:09.877
The good news
is we've managed

05:09.910 --> 05:11.679
To keep a lid
on the kidnapping so far.

05:11.712 --> 05:14.014
So what do we know
about this woman?

05:14.047 --> 05:16.917
She's one of five
significant warlords
in the territory.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.686
Now, we don't know
her place of origin,

05:18.719 --> 05:20.788
Date of birth or if
Ulrika's even her real name,

05:20.821 --> 05:23.424
But we do know
that she trusts no man

05:23.457 --> 05:26.059
Except for her right hand,
Grigori Babishkova.

05:26.093 --> 05:28.929
Their base of operations
is a former Soviet prison.

05:28.962 --> 05:30.764
It's a virtual fortress.

05:30.798 --> 05:32.466
The locals call it
"the Citadel."

05:32.500 --> 05:33.867
Frontal assault is out.

05:33.901 --> 05:36.404
This isn't bin Laden's
condo in Abbottabad.

05:36.437 --> 05:37.805
She'd be dead
while we're still

05:37.838 --> 05:39.106
Trying to kick in
the front door.

05:39.139 --> 05:40.441
Well, that leaves us

05:40.474 --> 05:41.875
With a long shot,
infiltration.

05:41.909 --> 05:43.944
Now, the problem with that
is, other than Grigori,

05:43.977 --> 05:45.546
She's completely paranoid
about all men.

05:45.579 --> 05:47.381
I mean,
her psych evaluation says

05:47.415 --> 05:49.417
That it's
almost pathological,
unresolved paternal...

05:49.450 --> 05:50.718
Daddy issues. Got it.

05:50.751 --> 05:52.753
So she'd be doubly on guard

05:52.786 --> 05:54.488
If some strange men
started knocking at her door.

05:54.522 --> 05:55.589
What does she feel
about women?

05:55.623 --> 05:56.957
Oh, her hate is unisex.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.492
She thinks women are weak

05:58.526 --> 06:00.027
And underestimates them.

06:00.060 --> 06:01.595
Then that's
who we go with.

06:01.629 --> 06:02.796
Use her prejudice
against her.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.398
We don't have anyone,
ma'am,

06:04.432 --> 06:05.933
I mean,
at least not qualified.

06:05.966 --> 06:08.135
The military
changed their position
on women in combat

06:08.168 --> 06:09.603
Too soon for this one.

06:09.637 --> 06:10.938
And our own people?

06:10.971 --> 06:13.173
Anyone who could
is too imbedded,

06:13.206 --> 06:15.576
And, I mean, even if
we could get them out

06:15.609 --> 06:17.445
Without blowing their cover
or getting them killed,

06:17.478 --> 06:18.979
We couldn't do it in time.

06:19.012 --> 06:21.415
We just
need to think outside
the box in this case.

06:21.449 --> 06:24.585
Or more accurately...

06:25.653 --> 06:27.688
Inside the Box.

06:40.468 --> 06:44.137
[Sighs] Is that
two weeks up already?

06:44.171 --> 06:45.639
Pizza day.

07:07.060 --> 07:10.964
[Cracking knucles]

07:15.503 --> 07:17.471
I been waiting
for today, Clay.

07:19.507 --> 07:20.641
Me, too.

07:20.674 --> 07:22.610
You only got two weeks
in the hole,

07:22.643 --> 07:24.545
But my girl's still
stuck in infirmary,

07:24.578 --> 07:26.814
Breathing
through a goddamn tube.

07:26.847 --> 07:27.981
I told her
what would happen

07:28.015 --> 07:29.249
If she didn't stop
shaking me down.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.884
You don't think
you gotta pay me tribute

07:30.918 --> 07:33.053
Like everybody else
around here?

07:34.121 --> 07:36.056
No.

07:36.089 --> 07:38.526
And what was
with the lackey?

07:38.559 --> 07:40.127
You should have
told me to my face.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.496
Aw, Clay,
you know I prefer

07:42.530 --> 07:44.598
Talking about people
behind they back.

07:44.632 --> 07:46.967
[Grunts]

08:01.715 --> 08:04.685
I just wanted
my goddamn pizza.

08:09.289 --> 08:11.525
Thanks.

08:15.295 --> 08:17.097
Cassandra Clay?
What?

08:23.637 --> 08:24.872
Here, kitty, kitty.

08:24.905 --> 08:26.674
Fuck off, Pignatelli.
I'm working.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.211
Don't worry.

08:31.244 --> 08:34.081
I'll pay you
every penny
you're worth.

08:34.114 --> 08:35.783

08:38.818 --> 08:40.688
Yeah.

08:40.721 --> 08:43.056
Little privacy,
please.

08:44.692 --> 08:46.794
I'll be keeping
an eye out on you.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.562
Hey, pig face!

08:51.331 --> 08:52.833
Fuck!

08:52.866 --> 08:54.034
You'll do.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.202
[Grunts]

09:08.816 --> 09:10.651
Mei-Lin Fong?

09:12.352 --> 09:14.154
[Sighs] CIA?

09:14.187 --> 09:16.556
Give me a moment.

09:31.805 --> 09:33.106

09:35.976 --> 09:39.112
[Women yelling]
Eww! What the hell?!

09:40.180 --> 09:42.049
Nice trick.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.918
Thank you.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.066
Mona.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.069
Raven.

10:06.974 --> 10:09.643
I knew it was
just a matter of time

10:09.677 --> 10:11.812
Before you
came crawling back.

10:13.013 --> 10:14.948
Cutie-pie.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.318
Office perk?

10:22.155 --> 10:23.223
Surprise.

10:27.861 --> 10:29.797
Fucking bitch!

10:43.744 --> 10:46.780
Ladies, I hope you excuse
the rough treatment,

10:46.814 --> 10:48.315
But time is money.

10:48.348 --> 10:52.452
Mae-Lin Fong,
explosive ordnance disposal,

10:52.485 --> 10:54.722
Qualified
multiengine pilot.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.089
I also play piano.

10:56.123 --> 10:59.459
Then you turned
self-styled techno-anarchist,

10:59.492 --> 11:01.695
Blew up what you
described at the trial

11:01.729 --> 11:04.331
As a "crooked
Wall Street bank."

11:04.364 --> 11:06.099
Sentenced to 15 years.

11:06.133 --> 11:07.701
[Mouths words]

11:07.735 --> 11:09.002
What does a Chinese girl

11:09.036 --> 11:10.771
Know about
making bombs, anyway?

11:10.804 --> 11:13.974
[Faking accent]
Oh, the Chinese
invented gunpowder.

11:14.007 --> 11:16.343
[No accent]
Or did they not
teach you that

11:16.376 --> 11:17.377
In the trailer park,
sugar tits?

11:19.179 --> 11:23.751
Kathryn Morgan,
Marine-Corps-qualified
scout sniper.

11:23.784 --> 11:26.386
10 years for shooting up
your boyfriend's truck

11:26.419 --> 11:28.221
While he and
his mistress were in it.

11:28.255 --> 11:29.222
Shocker.

11:29.256 --> 11:31.058
Not that great of a job.

11:31.091 --> 11:32.059
You missed.

11:32.092 --> 11:33.861
If I wanted them dead,

11:33.894 --> 11:36.163
I would have
only needed two rounds.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.766
I was just teaching
that cheap bastard
a lesson.

11:40.868 --> 11:43.170
Cassandra Clay,
part of the pilot program

11:43.203 --> 11:45.372
To prove that women
can serve in combat.

11:45.405 --> 11:47.875
Ranger school, then Delta.

11:47.908 --> 11:50.911
You were even given command
of your own little unit.

11:50.944 --> 11:53.213
A real old G.I. Jane...

11:55.215 --> 11:58.852
Until you lost half
your team in Afghanistan,

11:58.886 --> 11:59.987
Attacked your C.O.

12:00.020 --> 12:03.290
25 years
for nearly killing him.

12:03.323 --> 12:05.525
You broke his arm,

12:05.558 --> 12:08.361
Broke his legs,
one in four places,

12:08.395 --> 12:11.832
Broke three ribs,
which resulted
in puncturing his lung.

12:11.865 --> 12:14.134
You squashed
his eye socket.

12:14.167 --> 12:16.837
Look, I can't
take credit
for all of that.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.806
He was also
hit by a truck.

12:18.839 --> 12:20.207
When you threw him
into it.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.175
And then
at your court-martial,

12:22.209 --> 12:24.778
Not one peep of why.

12:24.812 --> 12:26.947
I couldn't recall.

12:28.115 --> 12:29.817
Saving the best
for last?

12:31.985 --> 12:33.120
Raven.

12:34.487 --> 12:37.057
I'm not gonna tell
your real name,

12:37.090 --> 12:39.559
Agency courtesy and all.

12:39.592 --> 12:42.095
That, and I'd crush
your fucking throat.

12:44.464 --> 12:47.000
You've seen
everybody's dirty laundry.

12:47.034 --> 12:49.269
I think it's time
they see yours.

12:49.302 --> 12:52.272
You see,
Raven was one of us.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.942
We taught her how
to seduce and kill,

12:54.975 --> 12:58.011
And she did it well,
very well,

12:58.045 --> 13:01.949
Until she started moonlighting
as a hit woman for hire.

13:03.183 --> 13:04.818
Private sector
paid good.

13:04.852 --> 13:07.020
We might have
turned our backs on that,

13:07.054 --> 13:09.056
But then you
killed one of ours.

13:09.089 --> 13:11.358
That paid even better.

13:11.391 --> 13:13.160
You're all pieces of shit...

13:15.028 --> 13:17.497
But today you're
lucky pieces of shit,

13:17.530 --> 13:19.399
Because Uncle Sam
wants you.

13:19.432 --> 13:22.369
Uncle Sam must be really
fucking desperate.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.004
The President's daughter

13:24.037 --> 13:26.974
Was kidnapped
by an Amazonian she-bitch,

13:27.007 --> 13:29.376
And she has her hostage
in some castle

13:29.409 --> 13:31.478
In the backwoods
of Shit-hole-istan,

13:31.511 --> 13:34.347
And she wants us
to prop her up
as new head of state.

13:34.381 --> 13:35.849
We're gonna tell her
go to hell.

13:35.883 --> 13:38.451
First, we need
to get Elise back,

13:38.485 --> 13:41.054
So this is the reason I'm
putting this team together.

13:41.088 --> 13:45.058
Kat, long-range
interdictions,
communications.

13:45.092 --> 13:47.094
Mei-Lin, explosives.

13:47.127 --> 13:49.362
Raven,
close-quarters wetwork.

13:49.396 --> 13:53.400
Clay, tactical training
and command.

13:53.433 --> 13:57.204
You get in, grab the girl,
get out. Simple.

13:58.538 --> 14:01.909
Just the four of us?
No backup?

14:01.942 --> 14:03.510
Right.

14:03.543 --> 14:04.611
Simple.

14:04.644 --> 14:06.513
Sounds like
a suicide mission.

14:06.546 --> 14:08.448
Well, that's why
we're sending in
you four.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.884
Oh lovely.

14:10.918 --> 14:11.985
What's the job pay?

14:13.120 --> 14:14.487
We've been authorized

14:14.521 --> 14:16.323
To give each of you
a full Presidential pardon.

14:18.091 --> 14:19.993
And even you, Raven,

14:20.027 --> 14:23.430
With potential to be
reinstated in your
previous positions.

14:23.463 --> 14:27.100
Of course, that's gonna
depend on the success
of the mission.

14:27.134 --> 14:29.069
How does that sound,
Captain?

14:29.102 --> 14:33.106
What happens
if we say no?

14:33.140 --> 14:35.242
Well, if you say no,

14:35.275 --> 14:36.977
Then you go
back to your hole,

14:37.010 --> 14:38.578
And you serve
the maximum sentence.

14:38.611 --> 14:41.148
We might even put
a few more charges
on top of that,

14:41.181 --> 14:44.117
Depending on how vindictive
the President feels

14:44.151 --> 14:46.987
When his daughter
comes home in several
small packages.

14:49.990 --> 14:51.658
So what's it gonna be,
ladies?

14:56.329 --> 14:57.530
When do we start?

14:59.132 --> 15:00.433
We already have.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.551
[Crying]
[Clang]

15:27.494 --> 15:29.262
I brought you
some food, hon.

15:39.239 --> 15:41.041
[Snaps fingers]

15:44.344 --> 15:46.413
Did the cook
char your chicken?

15:50.017 --> 15:53.020
May not be
a state dinner,

15:53.053 --> 15:57.390
But it's more than
virtually every resident
here eats in a day.

15:57.424 --> 15:58.758
You shouldn't waste it.

15:58.791 --> 16:02.495
The United States
doesn't do any negotiations.

16:03.563 --> 16:06.433
For the masses, no,

16:06.466 --> 16:08.001
But for you,

16:08.035 --> 16:11.471
The rules are different,

16:11.504 --> 16:14.307
And there's
virtually no price

16:14.341 --> 16:16.643
Your father wouldn't pay
to get you back.

16:16.676 --> 16:19.146
What makes you think
that he won't bomb you

16:19.179 --> 16:21.748
Even farther
to the Stone Age
if something happens to me?

16:24.051 --> 16:25.085
[Chuckles]

16:25.118 --> 16:28.155
So educated,
yet so naïve.

16:29.256 --> 16:31.524
The bullying Americans

16:31.558 --> 16:34.261
Invading
another poor nation
for revenge?

16:45.372 --> 16:47.307
Not in an election year.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.112
The exit!

16:52.145 --> 16:53.613
Now!

16:53.646 --> 16:55.448
Silly girl.

16:55.482 --> 16:56.749
[Chuckles]

17:01.654 --> 17:04.790
Step away,
or she's dead!

17:06.193 --> 17:07.194
Try anything funny,

17:07.227 --> 17:08.194
And I'll slit
your throat!

17:08.228 --> 17:09.195
Go ahead! Slit my throat!

17:09.229 --> 17:11.131
I give you permission!

17:11.164 --> 17:13.333
I am not
fooling around here!

17:13.366 --> 17:14.401
Neither am I.

17:14.434 --> 17:15.402
Shut up!

17:15.435 --> 17:16.836
I swear I'll do it!

17:16.868 --> 17:18.605
Do it!
Shut up!

17:18.637 --> 17:21.308
Killing me
is the only way
out of here! Do it!

17:21.340 --> 17:22.474
Shut up!

17:23.542 --> 17:25.112
How disappointing.

17:27.680 --> 17:30.717
I promised not to harm you,
not yet,

17:30.750 --> 17:35.388
But you do understand
that insolence cannot
go unpunished.

17:38.625 --> 17:41.761
Someone else has to be
punished in your place.

17:41.794 --> 17:44.431
No! Let me go!

17:44.464 --> 17:45.865

Feel free.

18:37.184 --> 18:40.320
No, uh,

18:40.353 --> 18:42.121
Bashful, are we?

18:46.226 --> 18:48.661
You want to unhook
the back?

19:04.911 --> 19:07.447
[Sighs]

19:08.848 --> 19:10.850
Ladies.

19:10.883 --> 19:13.453
Better than
prison jumpsuits,
isn't it?

19:17.257 --> 19:20.727
We put together
something special
for each of you

19:20.760 --> 19:23.363
That suits
your individual tastes.

19:26.733 --> 19:27.900

And a 4-by-32 tactical
milled out scope,

built into the optics.

20:04.904 --> 20:07.774

are in my office.

20:07.807 --> 20:09.642
I had them made
into paperweights.

20:09.676 --> 20:11.511
No problem.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.980
I'm sure I'll find
a way to break these in.

28:13.059 --> 28:14.693
It's Clay.

28:16.763 --> 28:18.230
What's going on?

28:18.264 --> 28:19.498
Encountered hostiles.

28:19.531 --> 28:21.033
Our transpo is
out of commission.

28:21.067 --> 28:23.369
We lost Vez
and the contact.

28:23.402 --> 28:25.137
Recommend
we abort mission.

28:25.171 --> 28:26.939
That's a negative.

28:28.107 --> 28:30.376
I repeat...
Our ride is shit-canned,

28:30.409 --> 28:31.911
And we have no leads.

28:31.944 --> 28:33.445
The mission is fucked.

28:33.479 --> 28:35.514
Strongly recommend
we abort.

28:35.547 --> 28:37.183
In less than 24 hours,

28:37.216 --> 28:39.786
Care packages with bits
of the First Daughter

28:39.819 --> 28:42.154
Is gonna
start showing up
at Pennsylvania Avenue.

28:42.188 --> 28:45.992
You're smart.
Just find another way
to get in.

28:46.025 --> 28:47.393
Use your
feminine charms.

28:47.426 --> 28:49.028
Charlie 2-3 out.

28:53.165 --> 28:54.466
[Sighs]

28:56.803 --> 28:58.838
Looks like
we're walking, ladies.

29:16.155 --> 29:17.489
Talk about
your shit-holes.

29:17.523 --> 29:19.458
They haven't
had a functioning
government

29:19.491 --> 29:20.893
Since
the Soviet Union.

29:20.927 --> 29:22.128
One can
hardly expect them

29:22.161 --> 29:23.830
To maintain
infrastructure.

29:25.197 --> 29:26.165
Cool guns.

29:26.198 --> 29:27.199
Thanks.

29:27.233 --> 29:29.368
American, yeah?

29:29.401 --> 29:31.203
Come to save us?

29:31.237 --> 29:32.371
Not exactly.

29:32.404 --> 29:34.807
I love America.
You guys all have

29:34.841 --> 29:37.409
The best stuff,
the best movies,
even have same gun.

29:37.443 --> 29:39.812
Hey, we got it, kid.

29:39.846 --> 29:41.380
You don't look
like Army.

29:41.413 --> 29:43.582
We're not.

29:43.615 --> 29:46.185
You're mercs, aren't you?
I knew it.

29:46.218 --> 29:48.955
I'm Lexi. You should
let me join up with you.

29:48.988 --> 29:51.490
I'll help you,
and then you bring me

29:51.523 --> 29:53.525
Back to America
with you. Deal?

29:53.559 --> 29:57.864
Look, kid,
we're not nice women.

29:57.897 --> 29:59.999
We're not gonna have
some fun adventure.

30:00.032 --> 30:03.369
We gotta
do some very bad things
to some very bad people,

30:03.402 --> 30:06.272
And it's no place
for a teenager.

30:06.305 --> 30:08.307
I can take it.

30:08.340 --> 30:10.376
I got skills to pay bills.

30:10.409 --> 30:12.244
Hah! Hah!

30:13.312 --> 30:15.181
Be gone, kid!

30:15.214 --> 30:16.949
[Hisses]

30:18.084 --> 30:19.118
[Chuckles]

30:19.151 --> 30:20.486
Was that
really necessary?

30:20.519 --> 30:22.221
Unless you
want to be responsible

30:22.254 --> 30:24.156
For that girl's life,
yeah, it was.

30:24.190 --> 30:25.524
Contact HQ.

30:25.557 --> 30:28.160
Let Mona know that we
made our way into town.

30:28.194 --> 30:29.628
I would have
shot her ass.
Yeah, I know you would.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.964
Oh, shit!
My sat-phone.

30:31.998 --> 30:34.500
Lexi!
Lexi!

30:34.533 --> 30:37.136
Ready or not,
here I come!

30:39.005 --> 30:49.115
Shit.
You take the doors. We meet
around back.

30:49.148 --> 30:50.116
Shit.

31:00.392 --> 31:01.994
Oh, come on!

31:02.028 --> 31:04.330
You guys are
making this boring!

31:08.467 --> 31:09.868
That cheeky little bitch.

31:12.238 --> 31:13.472
You almost had me.

31:13.505 --> 31:16.008
Too bad I'm just
too good for you.

31:18.610 --> 31:20.412
I could have eaten
for a month

31:20.446 --> 31:23.115
With what I would
have made from that.

31:23.149 --> 31:26.552
We'd like to help,
but, uh, we need this.

31:26.585 --> 31:28.955
That was
some nice work, though.

31:28.988 --> 31:31.623
So can I join up?

31:31.657 --> 31:33.625
Go back to being a kid.

31:33.659 --> 31:37.363
Okay, but you'll never
get into the Citadel,

31:37.396 --> 31:38.697
Not without me.

31:38.730 --> 31:41.167
That is why
you're here, right?

31:41.200 --> 31:43.169
Ulrika?

31:43.202 --> 31:44.436
What do you know about it?

31:44.470 --> 31:46.438
I know that
ever since yesterday,

31:46.472 --> 31:47.573
Security has been
tighter than ever.

31:47.606 --> 31:49.942
Something big
is going on.

31:49.976 --> 31:52.378
Ulrika's going to be
very cautious.

31:52.411 --> 31:55.314
Fortunately,
I have an idea.

32:00.086 --> 32:01.387
All right, kid.
What do you got?

32:01.420 --> 32:04.723
Every week, Ulrika sends
a truck to the port,

32:04.756 --> 32:06.993
And, every week,
that truck comes back,

32:07.026 --> 32:10.662
Always on
the same day, today.

32:10.696 --> 32:12.064
What's inside?

32:12.098 --> 32:14.400
Don't know.
Sometimes guns,

32:14.433 --> 32:16.402
Sometimes medicine,

32:16.435 --> 32:18.604
But always valuable,

32:18.637 --> 32:22.074
And I know
exactly what route
they take.

32:22.108 --> 32:23.075
Lexi...

32:24.710 --> 32:26.979
You want to be
on the team?

32:51.103 --> 32:53.639
I still think you guys
should have let me
use a bigger charge.

33:02.148 --> 33:04.383
All right, Annie Oakley,
you're up.

33:16.228 --> 33:17.363
Target has
been diverted.

33:26.538 --> 33:27.639
[Beep]

33:47.759 --> 33:50.162
Were you gonna
use that piece
of shit on me?

33:52.498 --> 33:54.533
Keeping body count
to a minimum.

33:55.801 --> 33:57.203
You're no fun, Clay.

33:58.670 --> 34:01.707
What are
you gonna do?

34:05.177 --> 34:06.545
[Groans]

34:07.613 --> 34:13.518
You know what?

34:13.552 --> 34:16.755
Pull that trigger,
I open a vein.

34:18.790 --> 34:21.226
"Thank you for saving
my ass, Mei-Lin."

34:21.260 --> 34:22.228
My pleasure, Raven.

34:23.462 --> 34:24.563
Domo.

34:24.596 --> 34:26.532
That's Japanese, bitch.

34:26.565 --> 34:28.134
Same shit.

34:34.273 --> 34:36.641
[Whistles]
Wow.

34:36.675 --> 34:38.610
What kind
of missiles
are these?

34:38.643 --> 34:39.844
ICBM.

34:39.878 --> 34:41.213
Which is?
Which is?

34:41.246 --> 34:43.114
Intercontinental
Ballistic Missile

34:43.149 --> 34:45.684
With a minimum range
of more than
5,500 kilometers.

34:45.717 --> 34:50.121
Primarily designed for
nuclear weapons delivery.

34:50.156 --> 34:53.824
Well, I guess I
know what to get you
for your birthday.

34:53.859 --> 34:56.695
We could put this

34:56.728 --> 34:59.165
On my Christmas list.

34:59.198 --> 35:00.799
We're not
taking that, Raven.

35:02.501 --> 35:04.470
And we're not keeping
those either, Mei-Lin.

35:04.503 --> 35:06.572
Where you gonna put em?

35:06.605 --> 35:10.876
Well, looks like we found
our calling card.

35:12.444 --> 35:14.246
So let's
get into character

35:14.280 --> 35:16.848
And start calling.

35:21.653 --> 35:24.122
[Honking]

35:25.757 --> 35:29.127
[Honking]

35:33.499 --> 35:34.600
Ulrika.

35:34.633 --> 35:35.734
What?

35:35.767 --> 35:37.469
They've found us.

35:56.322 --> 35:57.256
Lose something?

36:04.463 --> 36:07.266
Thank you for returning
my shipment.

36:07.299 --> 36:09.535
You've earned
30 seconds of my time.

36:09.568 --> 36:13.539
I suggest you use it
to persuade me
not to shoot you.

36:13.572 --> 36:14.640
Absolutely.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.908
We could have kept
this bad boy

36:16.942 --> 36:18.410
And sold
what was inside,

36:18.444 --> 36:19.711
But that would
be peanuts

36:19.745 --> 36:21.647
Compared to what
we have to offer.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.382
Which is?

36:23.415 --> 36:24.683
If you will...

36:35.894 --> 36:37.396
Fannie Pong...

36:38.864 --> 36:41.800
Daughter of Pong Fan Shui,
the industrialist.

36:44.536 --> 36:47.306
Third-richest man
in China.

36:47.339 --> 36:49.308
You broker the deal.

36:49.341 --> 36:50.842
We split the ransom.

36:52.478 --> 36:55.681
GRIGORI:
Checking identity online.

36:55.714 --> 36:57.249
See how easy it is

36:57.283 --> 36:58.584
To change Wikipedia?
[Snorts]

36:58.617 --> 36:59.918
Shut up!

36:59.951 --> 37:02.388
Fannie Pong,
confirmed.

37:02.421 --> 37:05.824
Your offer is enticing.

37:05.857 --> 37:09.261
Now explain why it
makes sense to me to not
just kill you now

37:09.295 --> 37:10.829
And keep all the ransom
for myself?

37:10.862 --> 37:12.964
Well, that's an option,

37:12.998 --> 37:16.435
But you'd be missing out
on a very lucrative
partnership.

37:16.468 --> 37:19.271
Pong is just
the introductory offer.

37:19.305 --> 37:23.975
See, we're good
at acquiring high-value
packages like this.

37:24.009 --> 37:25.944
We just hate the paperwork.

37:25.977 --> 37:29.915
Well, you've come
at a very inopportune
time for me.

37:29.948 --> 37:35.487
I'm not sure
I want to take on
new distractions.

37:37.723 --> 37:39.658
If you don't want
the easy payday,

37:39.691 --> 37:43.329
I'm sure one of your rivals
will be interested.

37:44.463 --> 37:45.897
[Speaking Slavic language]

37:45.931 --> 37:48.334
You knew coming in here

37:48.367 --> 37:51.303
That I would never
let you give such
a prize to any of them.

37:52.604 --> 37:55.006
[Speaking Slavic language]

37:55.040 --> 37:58.844
Now, y-you don't
want to shoot us.

37:58.877 --> 38:01.480
Well, at least not me,

38:01.513 --> 38:03.749
Not if you want to know
what I changed

38:03.782 --> 38:06.284
The missile's
arm-disarm codes to.

38:07.453 --> 38:10.356
'Cause, see,
without those...

38:10.389 --> 38:12.558
Hi...

38:12.591 --> 38:17.796
These are about
as effective as
a couple of sparklers.

38:17.829 --> 38:21.066
What makes you think
that I won't torture
them out of you?

38:21.099 --> 38:23.669
Oh, I know you would.

38:23.702 --> 38:26.938
I just... I don't know
if you've got the time.

38:28.006 --> 38:30.108
[Chuckles]

38:30.141 --> 38:32.110
Good.

38:32.143 --> 38:35.647
That's a difference
between men and women,

38:35.681 --> 38:38.517
Brains,
not thick-headed muscle.

38:38.550 --> 38:40.486
But I could keep pushing,

38:40.519 --> 38:43.655
Because I know
you'll flinch first.

38:43.689 --> 38:48.627
But it's so rare to meet
such industrious women...

38:49.728 --> 38:50.962
So for right now,

38:50.996 --> 38:54.366
I think it's
more exciting if I, um,

38:54.400 --> 38:55.901
Say, "Deal."

38:57.836 --> 38:59.337
Deal.

39:00.739 --> 39:04.376
Grigori, have the ICBM
taken to the airfield

39:04.410 --> 39:05.611
And loaded on the plane.

39:05.644 --> 39:07.078
I want it
ready to ship

39:07.112 --> 39:09.448
As soon as the funds
are wired.
[Whistles]

39:09.481 --> 39:11.883
Why don't you
and your associates
come with me,

39:11.917 --> 39:15.454
And let's
hammer out the details
of our arrangement.

39:15.487 --> 39:17.122
Whoa! No.
Not you, kid.

39:17.155 --> 39:19.024
Sorry. You stay here.

39:19.057 --> 39:20.659
What?
That's fucking bullshit!

39:20.692 --> 39:22.027
Excuse me?
I told you
about this truck!

39:22.060 --> 39:24.029
This was all my idea!

39:24.062 --> 39:27.799
Stealing my truck
was your idea?

39:27.833 --> 39:30.135
What's your name,
girl?

39:30.168 --> 39:31.470
Lexi.

39:31.503 --> 39:35.407
Grigori, show Lexi
our gratitude.

39:47.886 --> 39:49.421
Finder's fee.

39:49.455 --> 39:50.822
Cool.

39:50.856 --> 39:53.825
Don't do it again.

40:00.198 --> 40:02.734
Oh, I almost forgot.

40:02.768 --> 40:06.738
For being incompetent
enough to be foiled
by a little girl's plans...

40:06.772 --> 40:07.806
[Snaps fingers]

40:09.240 --> 40:12.210
Why don't we go to
the new VIP suites.

40:12.243 --> 40:13.712
Come on.

40:16.748 --> 40:19.585
Why don't you make sure
Lexi gets home safe.

40:19.618 --> 40:21.920
I was never big
on sightseeing, anyway.

40:21.953 --> 40:23.421
Good.

40:26.157 --> 40:28.527
Go find something to do.

40:28.560 --> 40:30.161
[Hisses]

40:32.498 --> 40:36.502
So, what y'all do
for fun around here?

40:55.521 --> 41:00.158
As you can see,
your country's war on terror
has been excellent for us.

41:02.761 --> 41:04.763
Suicide vests.

41:04.796 --> 41:09.134
Ah-ah. Can't give away
trade secrets
to a stranger.

41:09.167 --> 41:11.937
Oh, just as well.

41:11.970 --> 41:13.672
We're
business partners.

41:16.875 --> 41:19.578
We use a sealed
gelatin explosive pack

41:19.611 --> 41:21.012
With ceramic
ball bearings

41:21.046 --> 41:22.748
Designed to pass
right through

41:22.781 --> 41:25.116
Metal detectors
and bomb sniffers.

41:25.150 --> 41:28.854
For our brothers
in the Middle East fighting
the imperialistic and...

41:28.887 --> 41:31.557
Ha ha!
Whatever those crazies say.

41:31.590 --> 41:34.225
But they pay in cash,

41:34.259 --> 41:39.164
So if the fools want
72 virgins that bad,
none of my concern.

41:40.566 --> 41:43.101
If I were you,
I would avoid

41:43.134 --> 41:45.804
Your shopping malls
for the next few weeks.

[Beep]

41:57.248 --> 41:58.917

41:58.950 --> 42:01.887
I spared no expense.

42:14.700 --> 42:18.003
Only I know
the code to these.

42:18.036 --> 42:19.237
Call me paranoid.

42:19.270 --> 42:21.206
[Beeping]

42:30.048 --> 42:31.783
Okay.

42:31.817 --> 42:32.751
Ow!

[Beeps]

42:47.833 --> 42:48.900
What is this?

42:48.934 --> 42:51.369
Business,
in a sense,

42:51.402 --> 42:53.271
The oldest
business.

42:53.304 --> 42:54.873
Prostitution.

42:54.906 --> 42:56.374
Every woman
under my care

42:56.407 --> 42:58.243
Are required
to perform so.

42:58.276 --> 43:02.380
Money can only
buy a man's loyalty
for so long,

43:02.413 --> 43:04.716
So if you really
want to control them,

43:04.750 --> 43:07.819
Control
the choice pussy
in the region,

43:07.853 --> 43:09.354
And the rest
is easy.

Well, you better hope
the choice pussy

43:11.723 --> 43:13.158
Keeps getting
themselves locked up.

43:13.191 --> 43:14.159

43:14.192 --> 43:15.761
Well, of course.

43:15.794 --> 43:16.962
Sooner or later,

43:16.995 --> 43:19.264
Every woman winds up
in my prison.

43:19.297 --> 43:21.132
[Footsteps scuffling]
Ah.

43:21.166 --> 43:23.702
Here we are.

her sister.

43:33.211 --> 43:35.681
Ah, yes,

43:35.714 --> 43:37.649
The chambermaid
from yesterday.

43:37.683 --> 43:41.186
Oh, Grigori did
make a mess of her.

43:41.219 --> 43:42.721
And then to just
dump the body

43:42.754 --> 43:45.023
On the side
of the river, ooh.

43:49.728 --> 43:52.664
When Grigori
is done with her,

43:52.698 --> 43:55.366
She'll be
as obedient
as a poodle.

44:21.259 --> 44:23.261
Stick to the plan,

44:23.294 --> 44:25.163
We can't save her.

44:25.196 --> 44:26.832
Elise is
the mission.

44:26.865 --> 44:29.434
I don't know
who the bigger bitch is,

44:29.467 --> 44:30.802
You or her.

44:43.281 --> 44:45.350
I want to be up front
with you, Ms. Clay.

44:47.518 --> 44:48.887
I don't trust you.

44:55.393 --> 44:57.829
So why did you
let us in?

44:57.863 --> 45:01.466
Well, never let it
be said that I put
paranoia before profit.

45:03.902 --> 45:05.170
Well, look.

45:05.203 --> 45:06.905
Listen,
if you're too busy,

45:06.938 --> 45:09.074
Why don't you just
email me your schedule,

45:09.107 --> 45:11.009
And we can do this
another time.

45:11.042 --> 45:12.978
We haven't even gotten
to know each other yet.

45:23.855 --> 45:26.391
Your accent, American.

45:26.424 --> 45:29.928
Your posture, your poise,
military. [Chuckles]

45:29.961 --> 45:33.164
Forgive me
for being curious.

45:33.198 --> 45:36.401
My Army days
are long gone.

45:36.434 --> 45:38.436
Dishonorable
discharge.

45:42.207 --> 45:43.141
Go on.

45:51.249 --> 45:53.451
I had 20 good men
underneath me

45:53.484 --> 45:56.121
And a prick
of a C.O.

45:56.154 --> 45:59.224
He said that women
in combat were a joke...

46:00.391 --> 46:02.327
So he would
give us missions

46:02.360 --> 46:04.262
That were more
and more complicated,

46:04.295 --> 46:05.797
Hoping that
I would fail,

46:05.831 --> 46:07.465
And every time
I succeeded,

46:07.498 --> 46:10.168
It just really
pissed him off.

46:10.201 --> 46:13.972
One day, he tasked us
with clearing

46:14.005 --> 46:16.307
A cave complex
in Waziristan.

46:17.542 --> 46:19.110
Well, we walked in,

46:19.144 --> 46:20.545
And we were looking
at a hundred fighters.

46:20.578 --> 46:24.916
That was the beginning
of 14 hours of hell,

46:24.950 --> 46:28.920
At the end
of which I was one
of the lucky ones.

46:28.954 --> 46:30.421
I only caught
two bullets.

46:32.123 --> 46:34.092
Come to find out

46:34.125 --> 46:37.863
My C.O.
was intentionally
withholding Intel.

46:37.896 --> 46:39.364
11 good men died

46:39.397 --> 46:41.900
Because he
couldn't stand to see
a woman in charge.

46:43.068 --> 46:47.939
So when I got
out of the hospital,

46:47.973 --> 46:49.975
I put him in one.

46:50.008 --> 46:51.409
Heh.

46:51.442 --> 46:54.345
I knew there was something
I liked about you, Clay.

47:01.953 --> 47:04.455
Your boss lady
says we should make
ourselves at home.

47:16.501 --> 47:19.304
At home, I...

47:19.337 --> 47:21.406
I never liked
to drink alone.

47:26.344 --> 47:31.917
We are part
of an elite sorority,

47:31.950 --> 47:35.353
Women that have earned
the command of men.

47:37.455 --> 47:41.559
So tell me, how did
you earn yours?

47:41.592 --> 47:43.328
My father.

47:43.361 --> 47:48.199
He was a great
military leader,

47:48.233 --> 47:53.471
But he would never
have given me the power
like he would a son,

47:53.504 --> 47:57.075
So I shot him in the eyes,
and I took it.

47:57.108 --> 48:00.011
But then I realized

48:00.045 --> 48:03.681
Staying on top,
that's a challenge.

48:03.714 --> 48:05.316
Very true.

48:05.350 --> 48:08.253
Everyone wants
to steal your power,

48:08.286 --> 48:12.557
So I've learned
to distrust everyone.

48:13.691 --> 48:16.928
So forgive me
for asking, Clay.

48:16.962 --> 48:20.098
Why, of all days,
did you come today?

48:20.131 --> 48:22.567
Well, we didn't have
the bomb yesterday.

48:22.600 --> 48:24.335
Perhaps.

48:26.004 --> 48:28.940
Perhaps there's
more to it than that.

I don't know
what to tell you.

48:32.410 --> 48:33.979

48:34.012 --> 48:38.049
Well, I can easily have
my men make you tell me,

48:38.083 --> 48:41.152
But for a kindred spirit,

48:41.186 --> 48:44.322
I prefer
a different approach.

will attract at least
one rescue attempt,

right on schedule.

you're talking about.

may have faith in you,

lost faith in them.

Okay, we're stealing
her plane.

01:18:36.145 --> 01:18:38.014
Let's go home, ladies.

01:18:49.492 --> 01:18:51.194
Clear.

01:18:51.227 --> 01:18:52.295
Big plane.
Small girl.

01:18:52.328 --> 01:18:53.763
You good?

01:18:53.797 --> 01:18:55.431
Like an Asian chick
gives happy endings.

01:18:55.464 --> 01:18:56.465
I like 'em big.

01:18:57.566 --> 01:18:59.335
Why am I
not surprised?

01:19:01.370 --> 01:19:02.939
Get comfy.

01:19:02.972 --> 01:19:05.308
Okay. Yeah, Daddy.

01:19:05.341 --> 01:19:06.876
Okay.

01:19:06.910 --> 01:19:07.977
Ladies and bitches,

01:19:08.011 --> 01:19:09.879
This is
your captain speaking.

01:19:09.913 --> 01:19:11.380
Please buckle up.

01:19:11.414 --> 01:19:14.150
There is an Asian woman
behind the wheel.

01:19:14.183 --> 01:19:16.252
We've been cleared
to taxi by me.

01:19:29.966 --> 01:19:32.836
Pull up near
the cockpit!

01:19:32.869 --> 01:19:34.203
Keep
your panties on!

01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:48.918
Oh, hell, no.

01:19:59.495 --> 01:20:00.964
Aah!

01:20:01.364 --> 01:20:08.371
[Explosion]

01:20:12.541 --> 01:20:15.178
See you next Tuesday,

01:20:15.211 --> 01:20:16.345
Bitch.

01:20:16.379 --> 01:20:17.881
MEI-LIN: We had
a little problem,

01:20:17.914 --> 01:20:19.849
But don't worry.
I took care of it.

01:20:19.883 --> 01:20:21.951
It's okay.

01:20:23.419 --> 01:20:25.121
[Gunshot]
Fuck, no!

01:20:25.154 --> 01:20:27.123
Fucking America!

01:20:28.291 --> 01:20:29.625
God damn you!

01:20:29.658 --> 01:20:31.961
Motherfucking
get you!

01:20:31.995 --> 01:20:34.230
Ohh!
Shit!

01:20:36.665 --> 01:20:38.134
Who the fuck shot me?

01:20:38.167 --> 01:20:40.003
Fuck you!

01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:53.549
Bullet in my shoulder!

01:20:55.318 --> 01:20:56.352
Shit!

01:21:13.469 --> 01:21:15.171
Aah!

01:21:23.312 --> 01:21:25.181
You Americans
are so soft!

01:21:29.685 --> 01:21:31.387
This is over!

01:21:35.324 --> 01:21:36.993
You've stopped
being fun!

01:21:38.995 --> 01:21:41.430
And you couldn't even
save your team!

01:21:44.333 --> 01:21:46.402
Not yet I haven't!

01:22:13.696 --> 01:22:16.365
Uncle Sam wants her.

01:22:23.239 --> 01:22:34.350
[Yells]

01:22:34.383 --> 01:22:38.087
[Explosion]

01:22:38.287 --> 01:22:40.023
Fuck this!

01:22:40.056 --> 01:22:41.991
Send me back
to prison. Fine.

01:22:43.326 --> 01:22:45.394
Satellite tracking
isn't good enough!

01:22:45.428 --> 01:22:47.063
I need eyes
on that plane!

01:22:47.096 --> 01:22:48.131
I don't care
if you need

01:22:48.164 --> 01:22:50.066
F22s from
the fucking moon!

01:22:50.099 --> 01:22:51.134
Just do it!

01:22:51.167 --> 01:22:53.469
Ma'am!
We have a visual!

01:22:53.502 --> 01:22:54.503
They're
coming in hot!

01:23:28.304 --> 01:23:29.638
[Panting]

01:23:32.475 --> 01:23:35.311
You know that hole
you were saving for Ulrika?

01:23:35.344 --> 01:23:38.247
'Cause all you'll need
is a shoe box.

01:23:38.281 --> 01:23:39.682
[Chuckles]

01:23:41.450 --> 01:23:43.452
And Raven?

01:23:43.486 --> 01:23:46.322
That bitch's wings
have been clipped.

01:23:46.355 --> 01:23:47.523
Heh heh heh.

01:23:47.556 --> 01:23:50.193
Heh.
She's dead as a dodo.

01:23:50.226 --> 01:23:52.161
[Laughing]
She... She...

01:23:53.629 --> 01:23:56.132
I... I got shot.

01:23:56.165 --> 01:23:59.135
I have...
I have a bullet
in my shoulder.

01:23:59.168 --> 01:24:01.537
Ma'am, the jet is
fueled and ready to go.

01:24:01.570 --> 01:24:04.440
Ms. Prescott,
let's get you
out of here.

01:24:04.473 --> 01:24:07.143
Your dad's
waiting for you.

01:24:12.748 --> 01:24:14.117
Thank you.

01:24:14.150 --> 01:24:16.385
I'm gonna make sure
that my father

01:24:16.419 --> 01:24:18.487
Does something to help
all the women here,

01:24:18.521 --> 01:24:20.356
Really help them,

01:24:20.389 --> 01:24:23.092
Not just
some P.R. stunt.

01:24:23.126 --> 01:24:24.093
Miss.

01:24:24.127 --> 01:24:25.494
Hey, Elise,

01:24:25.528 --> 01:24:27.763
You sure you don't want
to be part of the team?

01:24:30.699 --> 01:24:32.501
You'd be a great addition.

01:24:32.535 --> 01:24:35.871
Somebody's gotta
make sure you guys
get your pardons.

01:24:35.904 --> 01:24:37.840
We have to go. Come on.

01:24:39.475 --> 01:24:43.412
Hell of a job, Clay,
you and your team.

01:24:46.182 --> 01:24:47.716
Got another
assignment for you,

01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:49.185
If you're interested.
Heh.

01:24:49.218 --> 01:24:51.287
[Laughs]

01:24:53.856 --> 01:24:55.724
Maybe tomorrow.

01:24:55.758 --> 01:24:57.726
I owe these ladies
a drink.

01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:59.862
Damn straight.

01:24:59.895 --> 01:25:02.498
Gotta be ladies night
somewhere in this place.

01:25:02.531 --> 01:25:03.632
Adios.
