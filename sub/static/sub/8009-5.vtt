00:09.999 --> 00:11.999
Keeping
Up with the Kardashians...

00:11.999 --> 00:14.999
Kylie, happy birthday!
Everybody make some noise for

00:14.999 --> 00:16.999
- Kylie.
- For sure, one of the

00:16.999 --> 00:20.999
- best nights of my life so far.
- What happened with

00:20.999 --> 00:22.999
- these divorce papers on Friday?
- I told Laura, "Let's

00:22.999 --> 00:25.999
tell the judge we need to speed
this along.

00:25.999 --> 00:27.999
I'm not gonna do this forever."
I think filing for the divorce

00:27.999 --> 00:30.999
is the worst thing in the world.
I feel like you're hurting

00:30.999 --> 00:35.999
everybody, but I need to do what
I feel is best.

00:40.999 --> 00:42.999
It is so hot in this
house.

00:42.999 --> 00:44.999
I think it's your
hormones.

00:44.999 --> 00:47.999
Oh. Wait, could I talk
to you about something?

00:47.999 --> 00:49.999
Mm-hmm.
- Like, kind of serious?

00:49.999 --> 00:51.999
Mm-hmm.
- So, I just went to

00:51.999 --> 00:54.999
lunch, because we were
celebrating Sheila's birthday.

00:54.999 --> 00:56.999
Mm-hmm.
- And I went like this,

00:56.999 --> 00:59.999
- and I pulled out these tampons.
Mm-hmm.

00:59.999 --> 01:01.999
And they were all
flabbergasted.

01:01.999 --> 01:04.999
They go, "Why do you have
tampons in your purse?"

01:04.999 --> 01:07.999
And I go, "'Cause I was on my
period."

01:07.999 --> 01:12.999
And they said, "How the hell
could you be on your period?"

01:12.999 --> 01:14.999
I said, "Well, because hormone
cream."

01:14.999 --> 01:17.999
Celeste is like, "Are you on
birth control?"

01:17.999 --> 01:22.999
And I go, "Birth control?
Why in the world, at 60 years

01:22.999 --> 01:26.999
old, would I be on birth
control?"

01:26.999 --> 01:28.999
And she said, "Because you can
still get pregnant."

01:28.999 --> 01:31.999
I don't think I could get
pregnant.

01:31.999 --> 01:33.999
Well, you'd have to
ask your doctor.

01:33.999 --> 01:37.999
If I am pregnant, I
don't know what I would do.

01:37.999 --> 01:39.999
Just call your
doctor.

01:39.999 --> 01:42.999
I'm gonna go feed Reign.
I'll be back.

01:42.999 --> 01:44.999
Okay.
I'll gonna call Paul Crane.

01:44.999 --> 01:47.999
Hello?

01:47.999 --> 01:49.999
Hey, Paul, it's Kris
Jenner.

01:49.999 --> 01:52.999
- I have a quick question for you.
- Okay.

01:52.999 --> 01:56.999
I started having my
period because of the estrogen

01:56.999 --> 01:59.999
cream that I'm taking.
My question is this.

01:59.999 --> 02:03.999
Is there any way that I could
get pregnant?

02:03.999 --> 02:07.999
- Absolutely not.
- That's good news.

02:07.999 --> 02:10.999
Do you make eggs?
Would I be making any kind of

02:10.999 --> 02:12.999
- eggs?
- Nope, nope.

02:12.999 --> 02:14.999
Scrambled?
Fried?

02:14.999 --> 02:16.999
- Poached?
- No, you're okay.

02:16.999 --> 02:19.999
Never thought I'd be so
happy to get a negative, no, you

02:19.999 --> 02:30.999
can't get pregnant.♪ ♪

02:46.999 --> 02:50.999
I was loving it that
everyone was saying I was

02:50.999 --> 02:52.999
- faking this pregnancy.
- 'Cause you were

02:52.999 --> 02:54.999
- skinny.
- My body is starting to

02:54.999 --> 02:57.999
get so big again.
I feel-- you know what I feel

02:57.999 --> 02:59.999
like?
I feel like I'm Buddy Love, and

02:59.999 --> 03:01.999
I'm turning into Professor
Klump.

03:01.999 --> 03:03.999
Like, I look at my hand, and
it's like, bloop!

03:03.999 --> 03:05.999
- I love Buddy Love.
- And it, like, just

03:05.999 --> 03:07.999
starts, like, getting big, and
then I look at my feet, and it's

03:07.999 --> 03:08.999
like, bloop, bloop.
I feel like every part of my

03:08.999 --> 03:14.999
body is just, like, exploding.

03:14.999 --> 03:17.999
So, um, how are you doing and
how is everything?

03:17.999 --> 03:21.999
What do you mean?
Like, with Lamar?

03:21.999 --> 03:26.999
Mm-hmm.
- I don't know.

03:26.999 --> 03:28.999
The whole thing just sucks.

03:30.999 --> 03:34.999
Like, whatever.
There's nothing you can do.

03:34.999 --> 03:37.999
I finally decided to move
everything forward with the

03:37.999 --> 03:40.999
divorce.
There's way more underlying

03:40.999 --> 03:42.999
issues than if we love each
other.

03:42.999 --> 03:44.999
That's never been a question,
but there's real life that comes

03:44.999 --> 03:48.999
in between love sometimes, and
as horrible as that sounds, it's

03:48.999 --> 03:53.999
true.
It's just like, a weird thing

03:53.999 --> 03:57.999
to, like, understand, like, so
much of, like, that one chapter

03:57.999 --> 04:01.999
that was such a huge part of my
life is just, like, closed.

04:01.999 --> 04:04.999
But I feel like you
finally are done.

04:04.999 --> 04:08.999
You're way closer to being over
it, where before I thought you

04:08.999 --> 04:11.999
were so into it.
And I was like, "Oh, God."

04:11.999 --> 04:14.999
Because you mistaken--
you mistake my kindness for me

04:14.999 --> 04:18.999
going back with someone.
You don't marry someone, and

04:18.999 --> 04:24.000
then you can cut them out of
your life that easily.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.999
I care about Lamar, so I want
the best for him.

04:27.999 --> 04:31.000
I just want the best for his
wellbeing.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.999
- Totally.
- But when it starts to

04:33.999 --> 04:37.999
become toxic on my current life,
then that's when I have to

04:37.999 --> 04:43.000
remove myself.
I've let our divorce be dormant

04:43.000 --> 04:46.999
for quite some time now.
Trying to give Lamar time to

04:46.999 --> 04:51.999
make an effort.
He can't commit to making us

04:51.999 --> 04:55.999
better, so I have to now step
away, and I have to do what's

04:55.999 --> 05:00.999
best for me, and I can still
love him, but I have to love and

05:00.999 --> 05:02.999
let go, I guess.

05:04.999 --> 05:07.999
Anyway...
You know?

05:07.999 --> 05:09.999
It's just dumb.

05:19.999 --> 05:22.999
- Hey.
- What's up, Khlo?

05:22.999 --> 05:24.999
It's so pretty out
here.

05:24.999 --> 05:26.999
- It is.
- Never  done.

05:26.999 --> 05:29.999
How is this place not

05:29.999 --> 05:30.999
- done?
- All my landscaping I

05:30.999 --> 05:32.999
want to get done.
I'm supposed to redo my whole

05:32.999 --> 05:34.999
- barbeque area.
- This house is so

05:34.999 --> 05:36.999
- perfect.
- Thank you.

05:36.999 --> 05:38.999
Kendall and I follow this
Instagram account called

05:38.999 --> 05:42.999
blackjaguarwhitetiger, and it's
about this guy who's just, like,

05:42.999 --> 05:44.999
- this really wealthy guy.
- Yeah.

05:44.999 --> 05:46.999
- Do you know of him?
- Yeah, dope, dope.

05:46.999 --> 05:49.999
And he just rescues,
like, mainly exotic cats.

05:49.999 --> 05:52.999
How'd you guys find out
about this guy?

05:52.999 --> 05:54.000
- He got a movement.
- He has, like, three

05:54.000 --> 05:55.999
- million followers.
- He's got a serious

05:55.999 --> 05:58.999
movement, and what he do for the
animals is amazing.

05:58.999 --> 06:01.999
He rescues them from,
like, circuses or people who buy

06:01.999 --> 06:03.999
these animals for, like, pets
and then they get too big, and

06:03.999 --> 06:05.999
they don't know what to do with
them.

06:05.999 --> 06:07.999
- Where does he live?
- In Mexico.

06:07.999 --> 06:09.999
Kendall and I reached out to go
there.

06:09.999 --> 06:11.999
Like, he would love for us to go
and, like, bring awareness to

06:11.999 --> 06:14.999
his place, 'cause it's only
gonna add, hopefully, people to

06:14.999 --> 06:16.999
give him more donations or
whatever.

06:16.999 --> 06:18.999
- Right.
- He just rescues them

06:18.999 --> 06:20.999
to take care of them, and it's
just wild.

06:20.999 --> 06:23.999
Just with everything that's
happening, it's, like, a good

06:23.999 --> 06:26.999
time for me to get away, and
Kendall is always just, like,

06:26.999 --> 06:30.999
good energy to be around.
I just don't want to be here.

06:30.999 --> 06:33.999
Just, like, too much drama in
the LBC.

06:33.999 --> 06:37.999
Right now, there is so much
going on in my life that I just

06:37.999 --> 06:41.999
- want to get away.
- Wait, so you're gonna

06:41.999 --> 06:45.999
- go to Mexico and visit this guy?
- Yeah. I just like

06:45.999 --> 06:48.999
people that like to do, like,
good things for others.

06:48.999 --> 06:51.000
- He gained followers fast.
- Fast. I mean, ,

06:51.000 --> 06:54.999
I've been following the guy
since he had 1,000 followers, so

06:54.999 --> 06:56.999
I might need to jump on that
trip.

06:56.999 --> 06:58.999
- Yeah, you could come.
- Wait, so you just

06:58.999 --> 07:01.999
- jumped on their bandwagon?
- I'm already halfway.

07:01.999 --> 07:05.999
Well, they say that
it's really therapeutic to do

07:05.999 --> 07:09.999
something around animals for
people that are stressed.

07:09.999 --> 07:13.000
I don't think they were
referring to lion, tiger and

07:13.000 --> 07:17.999
bear situation, exactly, but
whatever floats your boat.

07:17.999 --> 07:19.999
I want to play with
the big jaguar.

07:19.999 --> 07:23.999
He has this big jaguar, and a
jaguar can crush your skull.

07:23.999 --> 07:25.999
You guys are living on
the edge.

07:25.999 --> 07:27.999
- Yeah.
- You wouldn't want to

07:27.999 --> 07:29.999
- go?
- I have so much going

07:29.999 --> 07:32.999
on.
I mean, when are you going?

07:32.999 --> 07:34.999
Like, soon.
I don't like to give too much

07:34.999 --> 07:36.999
- information.
- Okay.

07:36.999 --> 07:39.999
So, she basically
saying, "You either in or you're

07:39.999 --> 07:41.999
mother out."
Yeah.

07:41.999 --> 07:45.999
- I think I'm mother out.
- Well, whatever they

07:45.999 --> 07:48.999
say. I'm just following the
bandwagon.

07:48.999 --> 07:50.999
- You guys have fun.
- Thanks, Mom.

07:50.999 --> 07:52.999
Uh-oh.

07:52.999 --> 07:54.999
Mama's leaving.
You should have saw the dog

07:54.999 --> 07:58.999
- jump, Khloe.
- Gooberstein.

08:07.999 --> 08:09.999
- Hi, guys.
- Wait, are you putting

08:09.999 --> 08:11.999
your dirty feet on my new white
couch?

08:11.999 --> 08:13.999
- My feet are so clean.
- No, they're actually...

08:13.999 --> 08:15.999
You just walked through the
dirty backyard.

08:15.999 --> 08:17.999
Your dirty
backyard?

08:17.999 --> 08:19.999
Well, you know, it's
dusty.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.999
This is a pregnant
woman you're talking to.

08:21.999 --> 08:24.999
- Yeah.
- I feel like she's been

08:24.999 --> 08:26.999
pregnant longer than I was
pregnant.

08:26.999 --> 08:29.999
Don't worry.

08:29.999 --> 08:31.999
Soak it in.
It'll never happen again.

08:31.999 --> 08:35.999
- This is it?
- This is it, one-hundo.

08:35.999 --> 08:39.999
One of each, and I'm good.
Wait, so Kylie is, like,

08:39.999 --> 08:42.999
hosting parties for her
birthday?

08:42.999 --> 08:44.999
It's not my favorite
thing that she does.

08:44.999 --> 08:46.999
- First of all...
- Yeah.

08:46.999 --> 08:48.999
...she has to go to
Europe or Canada; another

08:48.999 --> 08:50.999
- country.
- Right.

08:50.999 --> 08:52.999
And I just don't think,
you know, she needs to be doing

08:52.999 --> 08:56.999
that.
I don't need her to run into a

08:56.999 --> 09:00.999
bunch of problems in clubs.
Now that Kylie's 18, this will

09:00.999 --> 09:05.999
be her first personal appearance
in a place where the drinking

09:05.999 --> 09:09.999
age is 18, which means that she
may not be drinking because

09:09.999 --> 09:13.999
she's not a big drinker, but the
crowds might get a little more,

09:13.999 --> 09:17.999
you know, intense.
And so, yeah, I'm very anxious

09:17.999 --> 09:21.999
and nervous and worried about my
baby girl.

09:21.999 --> 09:25.000
I just don't want her to grow up
too fast.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.999
But she's looking at
it as this-- she's doing

09:27.999 --> 09:29.999
something fun and it's her
hustle; she's practicing her

09:29.999 --> 09:31.999
- hustle.
- I just want to keep her

09:31.999 --> 09:33.999
- in check.
- Yeah, totally.

09:33.999 --> 09:35.999
It's a fast world.
It's a lot faster than it was

09:35.999 --> 09:38.999
- when Kim was doing it, even.
- Yeah, she's definitely

09:38.999 --> 09:42.999
about a decade too soon.
Like, I was doing it at 28.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.999
What is she gonna be doing when
she's 30?

09:44.999 --> 09:46.999
I feel like she's
gonna have kids at, like, 22.

09:46.999 --> 09:49.999
- No, really?
- I swear-- she's,

09:49.999 --> 09:52.000
like, in such fast-forward that,
like, I feel like everything's

09:52.000 --> 09:54.999
gonna get so boring--
She's already 26.

09:54.999 --> 09:56.999
I had my first baby at
22.

09:56.999 --> 09:59.999
But those were the
old days.

09:59.999 --> 10:03.999
Now I'm even more
anxious and freaked out, so I

10:03.999 --> 10:06.999
don't want to be that
overbearing mom, but I'm gonna

10:06.999 --> 10:09.999
have to say something to Kylie.

10:12.999 --> 10:14.999
Has anybody ever
walked through there with you?

10:14.999 --> 10:17.999
- You want to come?
- I'll do it!

10:17.999 --> 10:20.999
I just feel like why not?
I've always wanted to run with

10:20.999 --> 10:23.999
the animals.

10:23.999 --> 10:26.999
Oh, my God.

10:26.999 --> 10:28.999
There are so many people here.

10:46.999 --> 10:49.999
Isn't it crazy that

10:49.999 --> 10:51.999
I learned Spanish for ten years
in school and I don't know

10:51.999 --> 10:54.999
- anything.
- Really?

10:54.999 --> 10:56.999
- I understand a lot.
- Are we three hours

10:56.999 --> 10:58.999
ahead or two?
Dos.

10:58.999 --> 11:01.999
- Good job!
- Thanks.

11:01.999 --> 11:04.999
Muy bien.
I am so excited to go to The

11:04.999 --> 11:07.999
Black Jaguar-White Tiger
organization.

11:07.999 --> 11:11.999
I'm so happy to get away.
I think Mexico's gonna be a good

11:11.999 --> 11:14.999
distraction with everything
that's going on in my life.

11:14.999 --> 11:16.999
Isn't it annoying that Mom
didn't come?

11:16.999 --> 11:18.999
- I know, right?
- I don't if she, she

11:18.999 --> 11:21.999
- doesn't really like animals.
- Yeah, my mom hates

11:21.999 --> 11:23.999
- animals.
- She's scared of the,

11:23.999 --> 11:25.999
she's scared of the cats.
I don't know, I think, hey, she

11:25.999 --> 11:27.999
just probably having some
"me time" anyway.

11:27.999 --> 11:30.999
And I'm gonna get some time with
y'all, the babies.

11:30.999 --> 11:32.999
You don't feel
weird?

11:32.999 --> 11:36.999
Feel weird?
Uh, what are y'all-- creatures?

11:36.999 --> 11:38.999
- No.
- I don't feel weird.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.999
We took you here to
kill you.

11:43.999 --> 11:47.999
- Thank you.
- This is nice.

11:47.999 --> 11:51.999
I have to get on the Wi-Fi stat.
Code for the Wi-Fi!

11:51.999 --> 11:55.999
Food!

11:55.999 --> 11:58.999
- That's the way it goes.
- So, what's up, Miss

11:58.999 --> 12:00.999
- Kendall?
- Nothing.

12:00.999 --> 12:02.999
It's your first time
really getting to hang-hang with

12:02.999 --> 12:04.999
me.
You got some questions for me?

12:04.999 --> 12:06.999
- Got anything you want to know?
- Do I have questions

12:06.999 --> 12:08.999
- for you?
- Yes, I'm sitting on

12:08.999 --> 12:10.999
your brain.

12:10.999 --> 12:12.999
- No.
- I tend to pay more

12:12.999 --> 12:14.999
attention to you and Kylie.
I-I think about y'all the most.

12:14.999 --> 12:16.999
- Really?
- 'Cause y'all are

12:16.999 --> 12:18.999
babies, yeah.
It's my way of seeing about you.

12:18.999 --> 12:20.999
Kylie and I are,
like, pretty chill for, like,

12:20.999 --> 12:22.999
the younger ones.
'Cause I feel like the younger

12:22.999 --> 12:24.999
ones usually get really
defensive and, like, protective.

12:24.999 --> 12:27.999
- Yeah.
- But...

12:27.999 --> 12:30.999
Y'all do so much, so
y'all out on your own and I

12:30.999 --> 12:34.999
always just, always want to make
sure y'all safe.

12:34.999 --> 12:36.999
- Yeah.
- So, you want to talk

12:36.999 --> 12:38.999
about anything, you want to ask,
feel free.

12:38.999 --> 12:40.999
- Of course.
- Open book.

12:40.999 --> 12:42.999
Same.
Since I'm always traveling, I

12:42.999 --> 12:45.999
feel like I haven't gotten to
know Corey very well, but he

12:45.999 --> 12:48.999
seems very sweet.
I mean, there's just definitely

12:48.999 --> 12:51.999
a big age gap between him and my
mom, so I don't know.

12:51.999 --> 12:54.999
Oh, Kendall, that's
not how you open it! Oh, my--

12:54.999 --> 12:56.999
It's not gonna do
much.

12:56.999 --> 12:58.999
Kendall!

13:08.999 --> 13:12.999
- Okay.
- What are you doing?

13:12.999 --> 13:16.999
Look what my friend
Alessandro sent me from Hermès.

13:16.999 --> 13:19.999
- He also sent you a present.
- He did, really?

13:19.999 --> 13:21.999
- Yeah.
- Baby gift?

13:21.999 --> 13:24.999
- It's cute.
- You could've rewrapped

13:24.999 --> 13:26.999
it and re-gifted it and pretend
like you gave it to me.

13:26.999 --> 13:29.999
- No.
- Aw!

13:29.999 --> 13:32.999
- Oh, it says Baby West.
- Oh, I love this.

13:32.999 --> 13:35.999
I didn't know it had a zebra on
it.

13:35.999 --> 13:37.999
A zebra.
That's so nice, seriously.

13:37.999 --> 13:40.999
So we should call him.

13:40.999 --> 13:42.999
Let's see.
Oh.

13:42.999 --> 13:45.000
- What?
- Oh, Lamar, he tried to

13:45.000 --> 13:47.999
FaceTime me this morning really
early.

13:47.999 --> 13:51.999
Lamar?
Why are you talking to Lamar?

13:51.999 --> 13:55.999
Well, usually he just
texts with me.

13:55.999 --> 13:58.999
But I guess he tried to FaceTime
me this morning.

13:58.999 --> 14:02.999
Khloe finally realized
you cannot change a person.

14:02.999 --> 14:05.999
You have to move on.
And even though we all love

14:05.999 --> 14:09.999
Lamar, I feel like now my mom
just kind of set everything

14:09.999 --> 14:11.999
back.
And now two years later, he

14:11.999 --> 14:14.999
wants to reach out?
I mean, Khloe was so upset when

14:14.999 --> 14:16.999
she left Nobu.

14:16.999 --> 14:20.000
Oh,.
There he is again.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.999
I know you get excited about
doing some of these appearances

14:23.999 --> 14:28.999
and I worry a little bit.
Kylie is finally 18, and with

14:28.999 --> 14:31.999
that comes a lot of added
responsibility.

14:31.999 --> 14:35.999
I always worried about her,
especially now.

14:35.999 --> 14:39.999
Khloe, don't run.
Maybe you should just come back,

14:39.999 --> 14:42.999
sister.
I'm freaking out.

14:48.999 --> 14:50.999
Khloe was so upset when
she left Nobu.

14:50.999 --> 14:52.999
Oh,.

14:52.999 --> 14:55.999
- There he is again.
- So why are you, like,

14:55.999 --> 14:57.999
engaging? You don't have to
respond right away.

14:57.999 --> 14:59.999
- I'm not.
- You know?

14:59.999 --> 15:01.999
I mean, now that I know
exactly how she feels and what

15:01.999 --> 15:04.999
she's gone through a little bit
more and all this stuff she

15:04.999 --> 15:06.999
didn't tell me, she's starting
to tell me, so it makes more

15:06.999 --> 15:08.999
sense and now I understand.
But at the same time, somebody

15:08.999 --> 15:10.999
reaches out to me--
But if your child

15:10.999 --> 15:12.999
- says...
- I know.

15:12.999 --> 15:14.999
- ...don't do this.
- I know, I get it now.

15:14.999 --> 15:17.999
I didn't understand it as much,
because I considered him, like,

15:17.999 --> 15:20.999
one of my own.
And then he tries to reach out

15:20.999 --> 15:23.999
to me and I-- Just like I would
never not respond to one of you

15:23.999 --> 15:27.999
guys, it's just not in me not to
respond to somebody that I love.

15:27.999 --> 15:32.999
And it literally breaks my heart
that it didn't work out.

15:32.999 --> 15:35.999
And I know it breaks hers.
So it's just been a process.

15:35.999 --> 15:37.999
She just, she's ready to
get over him and you need to let

15:37.999 --> 15:40.999
- that happen.
- Yeah.

15:40.999 --> 15:42.999
If she keeps on hearing
about him from you, it's gonna

15:42.999 --> 15:45.999
take longer and she's gonna get
sucked back in and she just

15:45.999 --> 15:47.999
doesn't need to be in that
space.

15:47.999 --> 15:50.999
- Yeah, I got it.
- But "do you" is the

15:50.999 --> 15:53.999
question.
Do you really got it?

15:53.999 --> 15:55.999
I think I do.
You can take those downstairs if

15:55.999 --> 15:57.999
you want.
Where should, where should I put

15:57.999 --> 15:59.999
- this tray?
- I don't know.

15:59.999 --> 16:01.999
You have so many accessories in
this house.

16:01.999 --> 16:06.999
- I would put it in the garage.
- Never gonna happen.

16:14.999 --> 16:17.999
Ooh!
This looks nice.

16:17.999 --> 16:19.999
Kylie?
Hello.

16:19.999 --> 16:21.999
- Hey.
- Hi!

16:21.999 --> 16:24.999
You look cute.
The house looks great.

16:24.999 --> 16:26.999
I especially like the dirty
underwear on the floor right

16:26.999 --> 16:28.999
there.
Those are awesome.

16:28.999 --> 16:30.999
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

16:30.999 --> 16:33.999
You have really light
hair.

16:33.999 --> 16:35.999
Yeah, I did the
highlights today.

16:35.999 --> 16:38.999
- Do you like it?
- I do.

16:38.999 --> 16:40.999
I'm trying to be like
you.

16:40.999 --> 16:45.999
18 years old again, baby.
Um, speaking of 18, I know that

16:45.999 --> 16:49.999
you get excited about doing some
of these appearances and I worry

16:49.999 --> 16:51.999
a little bit.

16:53.999 --> 16:56.999
I'm about to do my
first club appearance, for my

16:56.999 --> 17:01.999
birthday, in Canada, and my mom
just won't stop checking up on

17:01.999 --> 17:04.999
me about it.
But I'm grown now.

17:04.999 --> 17:07.999
I'm 18, I can handle this on my
own.

17:07.999 --> 17:10.999
- I was asked to do this.
- I know.

17:10.999 --> 17:13.999
And I think it's a great
experience, but I just want you

17:13.999 --> 17:16.999
to be on your best behavior and
watch your Ps and Qs.

17:16.999 --> 17:19.999
Totally.

17:19.999 --> 17:21.999
I think it's, uh...
drinking age is 18 in Canada,

17:21.999 --> 17:23.999
- right?
- Yep.

17:23.999 --> 17:25.999
I wasn't planning on drinking,
so...

17:25.999 --> 17:29.999
Okay.
Kylie is finally 18 and with

17:29.999 --> 17:32.999
that comes a lot of added

there's alcohol involved.
So I always worried about her,

behavior, missy.

them to spend time together.

for all of us?

19:13.999 --> 19:15.999

stressed out, she physically

maybe this throwing up is, like,

20:11.999 --> 20:14.999
anxiety.
I'm hoping that being able to

20:14.999 --> 20:17.999
spend time with the tigers and
the lions and the jaguars and

20:17.999 --> 20:23.000

months.

22:20.999 --> 22:22.999
How do you find
them?

22:22.999 --> 22:23.999
- Do people, like, come to you?
- Yeah, absolutely.

22:23.999 --> 22:27.999
Like, two days ago, actually, we
just got an e-mail about this

22:27.999 --> 22:31.000
lovely couple that made a
mistake of getting a tiger as

22:31.000 --> 22:33.999
- a... as a pet.
- Oh. Okay.

22:33.999 --> 22:35.999
And now, three months
later, she was destroying their

22:35.999 --> 22:37.999
house.
They made that mistake.

22:37.999 --> 22:39.999
But that's how we get most of
the kids.

22:39.999 --> 22:41.999
And you don't, like,
get mad at them or whatever.

22:41.999 --> 22:43.999
- Like, people feel safe...
- Look, if you get mad

22:43.999 --> 22:45.999
at someone, they won't listen to
you.

22:45.999 --> 22:47.999
If I yell at them, start
reprimanding them, then that

22:47.999 --> 22:49.999
- won't help anyone, you know?
- People have taken

22:49.999 --> 22:53.999
these wild cats to be house cats
or circus animals and that's

22:53.999 --> 22:55.999
tragic.
These animals belong in the

22:55.999 --> 22:58.999
wild.
Hi, baby.

22:58.999 --> 23:00.999
- Oh, my God...
- I told you they like

23:00.999 --> 23:02.999
- me.
- Hi.

23:02.999 --> 23:03.999
They like the women.
They feel what she's going

23:03.999 --> 23:05.999
- through.
- She doesn't feel

23:05.999 --> 23:07.999
- well.
- But the lions make me

23:07.999 --> 23:08.999
- happier.
- Yeah, I'm surrounded

23:08.999 --> 23:11.000
by love all day long.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.999
That's awesome.

23:13.999 --> 23:18.999
What's so awesome about Eddie is
that even though these animals

23:18.999 --> 23:21.999
are so scarred and damaged when
Eddie gets them, all he wants to

23:21.999 --> 23:25.999
- do is give them love and care.
- So let's start heading

23:25.999 --> 23:28.999
out.
Now, let me go first.

23:28.999 --> 23:30.999
Come on, come out.
Stay over here, on this side.

23:30.999 --> 23:33.999
I think it comes from
such a pure love.

23:33.999 --> 23:35.999
And he instills that back into
these animals and... and the

23:35.999 --> 23:40.999
animals just feel that.
It's really incredible.

23:40.999 --> 23:43.999
- Can I touch one of them?
- Yeah, come.

23:43.999 --> 23:45.999
Hi.

23:45.999 --> 23:48.999
Aw...
Hello.

23:48.999 --> 23:52.999
- Randy, hi...
- Aw...

23:52.999 --> 23:55.999
Stop it.

23:55.999 --> 23:59.999
- The cutest ever.
- Best thing is if you

23:59.999 --> 24:03.999
just come and pick him up.

24:03.999 --> 24:06.999
Yes, Kendall.

24:06.999 --> 24:09.999
- There you go.
- Pretty.

24:09.999 --> 24:11.999
Just keep your face

24:11.999 --> 24:15.999
away from me.
It's my money-maker, here.

24:15.999 --> 24:19.999
This is the quarantine
areas, where we put their

24:19.999 --> 24:23.999
immunizations, we deworm them...
They have to be over there, by

24:23.999 --> 24:27.999
law, 40 days.
Cielo! So she's my first rescue.

24:27.999 --> 24:30.999
- Oh, wow.
- So beautiful...

24:30.999 --> 24:36.999
She's my first rescue.

24:36.999 --> 24:39.999
I cannot believe he is
in there with a panther.

24:39.999 --> 24:41.999
Oh, she's the nicest
one.

24:41.999 --> 24:44.999
I knew a guy that had her and
wanted to sell her to a pet

24:44.999 --> 24:47.999
store, to have people take
pictures with her.

24:47.999 --> 24:49.999
So I convinced him to give her
to me.

24:49.999 --> 24:50.999
- She's so pretty.
- Want to go in?

24:50.999 --> 24:52.999
He's not gonna do anything, but
of course, he's heavy.

24:52.999 --> 24:57.999
Go past, go ahead.
Go ahead.

24:57.999 --> 24:58.999
Are you sure we're
good?

24:58.999 --> 25:00.999
- Yeah, yeah.
- It's fine.

25:00.999 --> 25:03.999
- Just relax.
- That's a leopard.

25:03.999 --> 25:05.999
Yeah, he is, he's like a dog
in that sense.

25:05.999 --> 25:07.999
He's super nice.
Of course, he can kill you

25:07.999 --> 25:10.999
in ten seconds.
But he's, like, the nicest being

25:10.999 --> 25:13.999
on the planet.

25:13.999 --> 25:15.999
Oh, my gosh!
Kendall, take a picture.

25:15.999 --> 25:20.000
It's absolutely insane.
I'm literally petting a leopard.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
- He's so sweet.
- Don't worry, he's

25:22.000 --> 25:24.999
gonna go through your leg...
your legs, he loves doing that.

25:24.999 --> 25:27.999
They're exotic and
beautiful, and they're loving,

25:27.999 --> 25:31.000
and I just like how therapeutic
they are.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Uh, I'll show you
the big ones.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.999
Khloe, Kendall, watch
out for your leg.

25:34.999 --> 25:36.999
- Of course.
- You're scared,

25:36.999 --> 25:37.999
- aren't you?
- No, I'm not scared.

25:37.999 --> 25:39.999
I just... I got my little
boundaries.

25:39.999 --> 25:41.999
I promise you they
won't do anything to you.

25:41.999 --> 25:43.999
Look at that one
just laying on its back.

25:43.999 --> 25:48.999
Look at this lion. Hi.
Look how beautiful this mane is.

25:48.999 --> 25:50.999
Here he goes, see?

25:50.999 --> 25:52.999
Hello, papa.

25:52.999 --> 25:54.999
That was awesome.

25:54.999 --> 25:56.999
We-we rescued him from
a circus.

25:56.999 --> 25:59.999
They were selling his-his fangs
for $700.

25:59.999 --> 26:02.999
And his skin for $10,000.

26:02.999 --> 26:04.999
But it's insane,
like, you can literally see how

26:04.999 --> 26:06.999
he wants to kill you in his
eyes.

26:06.999 --> 26:08.999
He would kill us.

26:08.999 --> 26:11.999
- In one second.
- What about this one?

26:11.999 --> 26:13.999
Well, we just got them
two weeks ago.

it will affect other people, and

leopard's gonna ... it up for us

for going in with lions and

And animals are definitely

29:39.999 --> 29:42.999
therapeutic.

my love.

- What exactly do you do

it hurts me so badly.
This whole thing shouldn't ever

32:37.999 --> 32:39.999
- be happening.
- Like, this is all her

32:39.999 --> 32:41.999
fault.

32:51.999 --> 32:55.999
This crowd is crazier

32:55.999 --> 32:59.999
than I expected.
I have done so many appearances,

32:59.999 --> 33:06.999
but no one's really drinking at
my book signings.

33:06.999 --> 33:08.999
I'm about to faint.
This is so uncomfortable.

33:08.999 --> 33:09.999
I know, it was so hot.
I'm-I'm sweating.

33:09.999 --> 33:11.999
I'll do a few
interviews and ... in this...

33:11.999 --> 33:13.999
And then you'll come
back here...

33:13.999 --> 33:15.999
And change.

33:15.999 --> 33:18.999
Kylie, you look so good.

33:18.999 --> 33:20.999
So what does it
feel like to be an adult in

33:20.999 --> 33:22.999
- Canada?
- I didn't think...

33:22.999 --> 33:26.999
I didn't think it would feel any
different, but now everyone is

33:26.999 --> 33:28.999
like, "Do you want a drink?"
Like, legally, and I'm like,

33:28.999 --> 33:30.999
"This is so weird."
Are you still

33:30.999 --> 33:32.999
- gonna be considered the baby?
- I'm definitely gonna

33:32.999 --> 33:36.999
still be considered as the baby.
My dad had a whole talk with me.

33:36.999 --> 33:38.999
He was like, "You're still the
youngest.

33:38.999 --> 33:39.999
You're always gonna be the
youngest.

33:39.999 --> 33:44.999
I don't care."
So... I've-I've accepted it.

33:49.999 --> 33:51.999
Let's get ready!
You guys ready...?

33:56.999 --> 33:59.999
We are here to
celebrate the 18th birthday of

33:59.999 --> 34:03.999
Miss Kylie Jenner!

34:03.999 --> 34:07.999
Can we get a Kylie chant?
Kylie! Kylie!

34:07.999 --> 34:12.999
Kylie! Kylie! Kylie!

34:12.999 --> 34:18.999
I love you, Montreal!

34:18.999 --> 34:23.999
I throw them out?
I've never been to anything

34:23.999 --> 34:28.999
where I'm throwing T-shirts at
people, but I guess T-shirts are

34:28.999 --> 34:31.999
soft, so I think it's fine.
Everyone's a bit crazy, but it's

34:31.999 --> 34:34.999
- fun.
- All right, guys,

34:34.999 --> 34:37.999
happy birthday to Kylie-- are
you ready?

34:37.999 --> 34:41.999
Happy birthday!

34:41.999 --> 34:46.999
I am so happy that
this appearance went well.

34:46.999 --> 34:50.999
I appreciate my mom for being
overprotective, but I feel like

34:50.999 --> 34:56.999
I have been raised well enough
that I know how to handle

34:56.999 --> 35:03.999
situations like this.

35:03.999 --> 35:05.999
I love you, Kylie!

35:12.999 --> 35:15.999
Anyone want to go
to Bible study tonight?

35:15.999 --> 35:17.999
- What?
- Do you want to go

35:17.999 --> 35:19.999
- to Bible study?
- I don't know.

35:19.999 --> 35:23.999
- Wait, I'm trying to listen.
- This is the craziest

35:23.999 --> 35:26.999
thing.
You and my mom are in cahoots

35:26.999 --> 35:29.999
together.
I'm not into this.

35:29.999 --> 35:31.999
You know, Khloe changed
her number to have a clean

35:31.999 --> 35:33.999
start.
And she gets a call from Lamar

35:33.999 --> 35:36.999
and she doesn't really know how
he even got her number.

35:36.999 --> 35:40.999
Are you joking?
What does that even mean?

35:40.999 --> 35:44.999
For the past two years, if I

35:44.999 --> 35:48.999
need to reach Lamar, I can't,
but he could always reach me if

35:48.999 --> 35:50.999
he needs something.
I kept telling him I need to

35:50.999 --> 35:53.999
move on with the divorce.
What do you want to do?

35:53.999 --> 35:56.999
And then it was public.
Then he started calling me, but

35:56.999 --> 35:59.999
only at all hours of the night.
It's always a one-sided

35:59.999 --> 36:03.999
relationship.
Mm, I mean, what should we do?

36:03.999 --> 36:05.999
Are you still on the
phone?

36:05.999 --> 36:08.999
Mm-mm.
- Well, 'cause Mom, she

36:08.999 --> 36:10.999
has the text messages from him--
Kim, let's call Mom.

36:10.999 --> 36:15.999
That's who I should call.

36:15.999 --> 36:18.999
Mom, I need to talk to you.
Lamar called me on my new

36:18.999 --> 36:21.999
number.
How did he get my phone number?

36:21.999 --> 36:23.999
If you weren't talking to him or
anything, we wouldn't have this

36:23.999 --> 36:26.999
to talk about today.
Like, I was removed from this

36:26.999 --> 36:34.999
whole situation.
I don't give a ... you psycho!

36:34.999 --> 36:38.999
For my mom to give out my phone
number just infuriates me and it

36:38.999 --> 36:41.999
hurts my feelings.
I mean, I love that love that

36:41.999 --> 36:44.999
she has for him.
And I wouldn't want to change

36:44.999 --> 36:46.999
that for anything in the world.
But sometimes you got to keep

36:46.999 --> 36:49.999
relationships separate.
This whole thing shouldn't ever

36:49.999 --> 36:51.999
- be happening!
- But it's none of her

36:51.999 --> 36:54.999
business.
The fact that you're even

36:54.999 --> 36:57.999
getting involved with, like,
your kid's drama and secretly

36:57.999 --> 37:02.999
talking to Lamar is, like,
insanity.

37:02.999 --> 37:07.999
Like, insanity.
She should feel like a piece of

37:07.999 --> 37:11.999
- ... like this is all her fault.
- You know what?

37:11.999 --> 37:13.999
You want to stay mad at Caitlyn?
I protected you and I've

37:13.999 --> 37:16.999
defended you.
You and I need a major break

37:16.999 --> 37:18.999
- from each other.
- You guys go on this

37:18.999 --> 37:20.999
vacation.
I-I don't, I am just gonna stay

37:20.999 --> 37:28.999
home and I, I just can't take
it.

37:32.999 --> 37:35.999
- No, it's so bizarre.
- Anybody want a

37:35.999 --> 37:38.999
Starbucks from 7:00 a.m.?
You could probably get typhus

37:38.999 --> 37:41.999
- or something from this.
- Khloe's on the phone.

37:41.999 --> 37:43.999
- Hello?
- Hey.

37:43.999 --> 37:45.999
This is a ...
messed-up situation.

37:45.999 --> 37:47.999
- You should tell your mother.
- No, she's standing right

37:47.999 --> 37:49.999
- here.
- I just don't even know

37:49.999 --> 37:52.999
how it came down to this place.
I'm just so, I'm just so upset

37:52.999 --> 37:54.999
right now.
Maybe just

37:54.999 --> 37:57.999
not make such a big deal out of
it and let it go.

37:57.999 --> 38:00.999
You're insane, Mom.
This is a really big deal.

38:00.999 --> 38:03.999
- You're insane.
- Thanks, Mom, for being

38:03.999 --> 38:06.999
- great.
- Yeah, she thinks she did

38:06.999 --> 38:09.999
- nothing wrong.
- Like, come on, Mom.

38:09.999 --> 38:12.999
Just take accountability and
just say sorry one time.

38:12.999 --> 38:15.999
I know that Lamar and
Khloe have had their problems.

38:15.999 --> 38:19.999
He's had so many issues that
he's been dealing with.

38:19.999 --> 38:22.000
But I also feel like he needs
us.

38:22.000 --> 38:26.999
Lamar doesn't have a lot of
extended family, so when he

38:26.999 --> 38:28.999
reaches out, I'm going to
respond.

38:28.999 --> 38:30.999
That's that my heart
tells me to do.

38:30.999 --> 38:33.999
For some reason, you
would think you would know these

38:33.999 --> 38:35.999
things, but you make the worst
decisions.

38:35.999 --> 38:38.999
Tell me one reason why they
should even communicate after

38:38.999 --> 38:41.999
she's finally had the balls to
divorce him.

38:41.999 --> 38:43.999
She doesn't tell me all
the information.

38:43.999 --> 38:45.999
Mom... I don't have all
the information.

38:45.999 --> 38:47.999
She doesn't tell me all
the other stuff that's going on.

38:47.999 --> 38:49.999
- You sound so stupid.
- Well, then I'm stupid!

38:49.999 --> 38:51.999
You are the one that
communicated with him.

38:51.999 --> 38:54.999
You know what?
You want to stay mad at Caitlyn?

38:54.999 --> 38:57.999
I, the first thing I did, I was
on your side and I protected you

38:57.999 --> 39:00.999
and I've defended you--
We all defend you.

39:00.999 --> 39:02.999
I never asked a ...
question, and that was my dad

39:02.999 --> 39:05.999
of 23 years, you crazy ...
and now this?

39:05.999 --> 39:07.999
You know what, you and I
need a major break from each

39:07.999 --> 39:10.000
- other, okay?
- Okay.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
I think we need to be
separated.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
All right.
You know what?

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
You guys go on this vacation.
I-I don't, I am just gonna stay

39:17.000 --> 39:19.999
home and I, I just can't take
it.

39:19.999 --> 39:22.999
We all love Lamar.
And truly, Khloe has done

39:22.999 --> 39:25.999
everything in her power to try
and save this relationship.

39:25.999 --> 39:29.999
She stuck with this for years.
I feel like now that she's

39:29.999 --> 39:32.999
finally moved on, my mom just
kind of set everything back by

39:32.999 --> 39:36.999
giving Lamar her number and not
taking responsibility.

39:36.999 --> 39:39.999
I think you guys better
fix your own problems.

39:39.999 --> 39:41.999
- This isn't my problem!
- I never asked her to

39:41.999 --> 39:43.999
- be involved in this.
- Yeah, no one's asking

39:43.999 --> 39:45.999
you to be involved in this!
We're asking you to stop being

39:45.999 --> 39:47.999
involved!

39:57.999 --> 40:00.999
Hey.
What are you doing?

40:00.999 --> 40:04.999
It's been really exciting over
here.

40:04.999 --> 40:06.999
So, what's up with
today?

40:06.999 --> 40:08.999
You want to talk to me about
today?

40:08.999 --> 40:10.999
It's been
the worst day ever.

40:10.999 --> 40:12.999
Kim and I are in the biggest
fight.

40:12.999 --> 40:14.999
Kim's yelling at me like
I'm an idiot.

40:14.999 --> 40:17.999
She's calling me, "You're so
stupid."

40:17.999 --> 40:20.999
It's so disrespectful.
Like, what kind of ...

40:20.999 --> 40:23.999
sensitivity chip is Kim missing?
Stop getting into everybody

40:23.999 --> 40:25.999
- else's business.
- Yeah, but, babe, you

40:25.999 --> 40:27.999
know, you--
She's doing the same

40:27.999 --> 40:31.999
thing she says I'm doing.
So I'm going along as--

40:31.999 --> 40:35.999
obviously my family I'm more
loyal to than anybody in the

40:35.999 --> 40:37.999
- universe.
- Right.

40:37.999 --> 40:39.999
And they're thinking
I'm on Lamar's side and I'm

40:39.999 --> 40:43.999
taking his side and this is all
my fault for what's going on...

40:43.999 --> 40:47.999
Because everybody is so heated
and so upset, I am the easiest

40:47.999 --> 40:50.999
person to blame for the entire
incident.

40:50.999 --> 40:53.999
So now everybody's yelling at
me, treating me with such

40:53.999 --> 40:56.999
disrespect, which is bizarre,
you know.

40:56.999 --> 40:59.999
And I'm, I won't put up with it
anymore.

40:59.999 --> 41:03.999
I don't want to be around that
negative energy.

41:03.999 --> 41:07.999
My kids are my first priority.
I think I've proven that for the

41:07.999 --> 41:10.999
- last, I don't know, 36 years.
- That's why they take

41:10.999 --> 41:13.999
- up for you so hard.
- You know, when you feel

41:13.999 --> 41:18.999
like you're doing the best you
can and everybody comes down

41:18.999 --> 41:23.999
with an iron fist...
it hurts.

41:23.999 --> 41:27.999
Like, these kids are screaming
at me because I should know

41:27.999 --> 41:30.999
better.
And all I'm trying to do is love

41:30.999 --> 41:33.999
everybody and make sure
everybody's taken care of and--

41:33.999 --> 41:36.999
But even though, you
know, with loving everybody

41:36.999 --> 41:40.999
still comes with boundaries with
the big kids.

41:40.999 --> 41:45.999
I'm always, like, asked
to smooth things over and then

41:45.999 --> 41:49.999
when I do, I catch nothing but
hell.

41:49.999 --> 41:51.999
And we both know, you
know, sometimes you have good

41:51.999 --> 41:54.999
intentions and the situation
will still backfire in your

41:54.999 --> 41:58.999
face.
Now you just know you got let

41:58.999 --> 42:02.999
them hear how they want to hear.
They X-ing people out of they

42:02.999 --> 42:04.999
life, they got to be X-ed out of
yours, too.

42:04.999 --> 42:06.999
I get that now.

42:08.999 --> 42:13.999
I would give anybody that I love
the benefit of the doubt.

42:13.999 --> 42:16.999
And maybe that's my downfall.
Maybe because I forgive

42:16.999 --> 42:20.999
everyone-- I give everybody 15
chances--

42:20.999 --> 42:23.999
Cut 15 down to, like,
negative one or something.

42:23.999 --> 42:25.999
Okay, well, that's just
what I'm about.

42:25.999 --> 42:27.999
But I understand what
you're saying, I understand.

42:27.999 --> 42:29.999
Is second chances and
believing in people and

42:29.999 --> 42:31.999
listening and not just
assuming--

42:31.999 --> 42:34.999
And just stop talking
about this, 'cause you've

42:34.999 --> 42:36.999
- already been through it.
- I can't, you're right.

42:36.999 --> 42:38.999
- I'm done.
And-and you had good

42:38.999 --> 42:41.999
intentions, so address the
things you, if you want to

42:41.999 --> 42:46.999
apologize, do it.
If not, not.

42:46.999 --> 42:49.999
Keeping Up
with the Kardashians...

42:49.999 --> 42:53.999
All we were looking for is for
you to say ... I ... up!

42:53.999 --> 42:55.999
Mom said, "Get her
out of my house."

42:55.999 --> 42:58.999
Write her back and say,
"Kim will gladly move out."

42:58.999 --> 43:02.999
St. Barts is so beautiful.
I've always wanted to come here.

43:02.999 --> 43:06.999
Who's that?!
I am so excited to see Tyga.

43:06.999 --> 43:09.999
It was, like,
specifically a girls trip and we

43:09.999 --> 43:11.999
had said that.
I don't know if that memo

43:11.999 --> 43:12.999
- got to Kylie.
- She has to like, make

43:12.999 --> 43:15.999
an effort to be with us.
