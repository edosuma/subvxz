class is so annoying.

( Girl #2 ): I know.
She doesn't teach us anything.

00:48.449 --> 00:50.042
And she falls asleep.

00:50.043 --> 00:53.922
Yeah. What is your brother
doing here on a Saturday?

00:54.322 --> 00:57.391
Some sort of dumb dinosaur program.

00:57.425 --> 01:00.661
Ah, enough chit-chat ladies.
Time to hustle.

01:00.694 --> 01:02.296
Suicides are up next.

01:02.330 --> 01:04.132
Um, coach?

01:04.165 --> 01:06.200
It's time for sprints.

01:10.638 --> 01:12.340
Right.

01:41.202 --> 01:44.305
Nah. Hadley is not even here yet.

01:45.006 --> 01:48.476
I've tried turning this thing
off and on about fifty times.

01:48.509 --> 01:52.380
But the Bluetooth receiver in the dino
doesn't seem to be connecting.

01:52.413 --> 01:53.681
Would you mind taking a look?

01:53.714 --> 01:55.283
I tried nearly every thing.

01:55.316 --> 01:58.086
Sure. Us scientists got stick together.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.981
The board is loose.

02:29.383 --> 02:30.284
Okay.

02:30.318 --> 02:33.487
TOMMY: Try it now.
It should work. But...

02:33.521 --> 02:37.291
If it's the battery there's no way
of fixing that before YAPS.

02:44.065 --> 02:44.732
Thanks, Tommy.

02:44.765 --> 02:46.600
Good luck out there.

Good morning, students!

03:13.227 --> 03:15.296
Good morning, Ms. Hadley.

03:15.329 --> 03:18.799
Wonderful! Today will determine
which one of your experiment will

03:18.832 --> 03:23.404
be in the statewide YAPS Science
and Dinosaur Competition.

03:23.437 --> 03:26.174
Have you guys met our special guest,
Dr. Reginald Reynolds?

03:26.207 --> 03:27.808
He's head of the Prehistoric Research

03:27.841 --> 03:29.743
and Development at VistaTech Labs.

03:29.777 --> 03:32.780
And he's so graciously offered
to choose an experiment today.

03:32.813 --> 03:35.216
And he's going to stay and
help us throughout YAPS.

03:35.249 --> 03:36.517
Say "Hi!" Reggie!

03:36.550 --> 03:39.153
It's "Dr. Reynolds."

03:42.523 --> 03:44.392
Who wants to go first?

03:44.425 --> 03:46.360
( BOY #1 ): Me! Ms. Hadley!

03:46.394 --> 03:48.129
Great. Okay.

03:48.162 --> 03:50.259
And just a reminder,
your experiment has to

03:50.260 --> 03:52.500
combine analog and digital
forms of technology

03:52.533 --> 03:55.336
in a way that it teaches us
something new about dinosaurs.

03:55.369 --> 03:57.505
MS. HADLEY: Go for it, Ethan.

04:14.622 --> 04:18.358
It's built perfectly to mimic
how dinosaurs once walked the

04:18.392 --> 04:21.161
earth according to current research.

04:21.195 --> 04:26.100
Robots like this can easily
help us mimic behavior.

04:26.134 --> 04:28.302
MS. HADLEY: Very impressive, Ethan.

04:28.336 --> 04:30.775
Did you have any problems
with the project?

04:30.776 --> 04:32.206
ETHAN: Nope. Not at all.

04:32.773 --> 04:35.576
Great! But, what's analog about it?

04:35.609 --> 04:37.611
I almost forgot.

04:39.213 --> 04:41.815
This will take a couple of minutes.

04:41.849 --> 04:44.752
Maybe someone else should go up
while we wait, Ms. Hadley.

04:44.785 --> 04:45.719
Okay.

04:46.487 --> 04:48.789
MS.HADLEY: Tommy! Go for it!

04:53.561 --> 04:56.664
Inspired by the CRISPR-Cas system
of DNA-RNA editing...

04:56.697 --> 05:00.301
...with additional
nucleic acid sequencing,

05:00.334 --> 05:05.473
my project allows that, without
the need of an initial specimen.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.708
All changes are made on software.

05:08.276 --> 05:09.643
So in theory,

05:09.677 --> 05:14.515
one could take map genome of an ostrich
and use the DILVIR system to

05:14.548 --> 05:20.388
make "cuts" to edit out or add
in additional genome changes.

05:20.421 --> 05:21.722
And in doing so,

05:21.755 --> 05:24.192
we could, for example,

05:24.225 --> 05:28.596
edit the ostrich DNA to get
multiple species of dinosaurs.

05:29.263 --> 05:32.633
TOMMY: And we should be able to hatch
a baby Edmontosaurus using

05:32.666 --> 05:36.136
analog device to input
the new DNA structure.

05:41.275 --> 05:44.778
TOMMY: This analog device is designed
to kickstart the DILVIR system.

05:46.514 --> 05:50.551
TOMMY: Using a gravity-based
interface. Um...

05:52.453 --> 05:56.357
TOMMY: We can start the process
using only kinetic energy.

06:05.233 --> 06:07.435
TOMMY: Using a ostrich egg.

06:14.342 --> 06:15.709
TOMMY: Using the DILVIR system.

06:15.743 --> 06:18.579
The modified enzyme will be
absorbed through the shell

06:18.612 --> 06:20.781
allowing the precess to start.

06:28.456 --> 06:29.623
It...

06:29.657 --> 06:31.292
it should work.

06:31.325 --> 06:33.394
I did all the calculations.

06:33.427 --> 06:39.233
Not only does my dinosaur mimic exactly
how it used to walk the Earth,

06:39.267 --> 06:43.771
but because of my use of analog
technology it guarantees

06:43.804 --> 06:47.441
no one will go hungry while studying.

for giving us this opportunity.

07:20.341 --> 07:22.443
It really doesn't matter who wins,

07:22.476 --> 07:27.748
just as long as we help humanity
learn about dinosaurs.

07:29.683 --> 07:31.419
MR. REYNOLDS: Well done, Ethan.

This is the best thing
to happen to me all day.

07:33.554 --> 07:35.923
Ethan's in. He'll be going to regionals.

07:36.824 --> 07:38.492
But Reggie, don't you think...

07:38.526 --> 07:43.497
It's Dr. Reynolds.
As I said, Ethan's in.

07:57.711 --> 07:59.347
MR. REYNOLDS: Okay.

08:16.397 --> 08:17.965
MS. HADLEY: Reggie, wait!

08:17.998 --> 08:20.434
Tommy's project is far more
technologically advanced.

08:20.435 --> 08:21.435
It didn't even work.

08:21.469 --> 08:24.605
But the fact that he even attempted
a project like this at such a young...

08:24.638 --> 08:28.342
Look! VistaTech is forcing
me to be here.

08:28.376 --> 08:30.811
Because one of the caveats of
our prehistoric research grant

08:30.844 --> 08:33.714
is that I spend more time with
the school science project.

08:33.746 --> 08:36.450
VistaTech has a financial
interest in this.

08:36.484 --> 08:39.386
I don't have time for
projects that don't work.

08:39.419 --> 08:41.732
I'm telling you, Ethan
has the talent and

08:41.734 --> 08:43.991
the charisma to win this YAPS regionals.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.894
And that would make
VistaTech very happy.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.729
So happy in fact we might
have a position

08:48.762 --> 08:51.399

TOMMY: Ms. Hadley, you've been
my science teacher for two years now,

08:55.903 --> 08:58.872
and I've always said that scientists
like you are the lucky ones.

08:58.906 --> 09:01.542
You get to experiment with new
ways of looking at the world.

09:01.575 --> 09:04.512
And junior scientists like me
are just as important

09:04.545 --> 09:07.581
because we chose to be the next
generation to shape the world.

09:07.615 --> 09:09.883
Like I know my DILVIR system can.

09:09.917 --> 09:12.001
I know my project
could use a little more

09:12.002 --> 09:13.887

09:13.921 --> 09:17.425
Please reconsider, and

Reggie, please.

09:20.794 --> 09:22.329

09:22.362 --> 09:23.874
A program like this
could change the future.

09:23.875 --> 09:25.065
Sure, it needs some modernization.

09:25.098 --> 09:28.436
There's no way a 12 year-old could
have created that kind of technology

09:28.469 --> 09:29.745
and have it work the way
it's supposed to.

09:29.746 --> 09:30.170

Dr. Reynolds works at VistaTech.

12:35.388 --> 12:37.224
In the prehistoric department.

12:37.257 --> 12:41.629
And if I get into VistaTech,
they can back me up on my project.

dinosaurs aren't your thing.

14:34.466 --> 14:37.010
every single competion
I've ever entered,

14:37.044 --> 14:40.147

you kicked out of the school too.

14:53.861 --> 14:55.796
ETHAN: In the mean time,

14:57.130 --> 14:58.365

14:58.398 --> 15:00.200
I trust you not to mess it up.

15:00.233 --> 15:07.107
And if you do, I'll mess up my project
and make it look you did it.

Oh, come on.

15:39.506 --> 15:43.877
There has to be another
experiment you're working on.

15:44.211 --> 15:48.916
Well, I started seeing if there's a way
to make a synthetic growth hormone,

15:48.949 --> 15:53.153
some type of a dinosaur version
of Somatotropin.

15:53.186 --> 15:58.091
That way we won't have to wait years or
decades for dinosaurs to reach maturity,

15:58.125 --> 16:02.395
especially if we ever figure out
how to clone larger herbivores.

16:02.429 --> 16:03.990
But I'm only in the first stages...
