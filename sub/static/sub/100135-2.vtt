00:02.836 --> 00:05.255
Fred, what happened?

00:07.424 --> 00:11.428
<i>Good morning. Mitch Kessler,
my cohost and partner of 15 years,</i>

00:11.512 --> 00:13.514
was fired today for sexual misconduct.

00:13.597 --> 00:17.601
My on-air partner, my TV husband,
is a sexual predator now?

00:18.894 --> 00:20.437
I didn't rape anybody!

00:24.233 --> 00:26.735
Hannah, you said you were looking
for stories about strong women tomorrow.

00:26.818 --> 00:27.903
Well, check this out.

00:28.737 --> 00:29.738
Yeah?

00:29.821 --> 00:32.241
You know you have over
a million views on your video?

00:32.323 --> 00:35.285
We wanna interview you
about why the video is going viral.

00:35.369 --> 00:36.370
<i>The Morning Show</i>?

00:36.912 --> 00:38.330
<i>I'm exhausted!</i>

00:38.789 --> 00:40.791
You seem a lot more relaxed today.

00:40.874 --> 00:43.502
Yeah, well, this is a whole lot nicer
than a coal mine protest,

00:43.585 --> 00:45.003
<i>I'm not gonna lie.</i>

00:45.087 --> 00:46.755
I think people want to trust
that the person

00:46.839 --> 00:50.175
that is telling them the truth
about the world is an honest person.

00:50.259 --> 00:53.428
<i>This is Cory Ellison.
I'm the president of the UBA network.</i>

00:53.512 --> 00:55.556
How would you like to come
and meet me for a drink

00:55.639 --> 00:57.140
and talk about your future?

00:57.224 --> 00:59.017
Alex, they were going to replace you.

00:59.101 --> 01:00.227
-What?
-He came to me.

01:00.310 --> 01:01.937
They said they wanted to make a change.
ï»¿1

03:59.523 --> 04:03.235
Bradley Jackson. Thank you so much for
coming to meet me on such short notice.

04:03.392 --> 04:06.103
Come on. You're the head
of two divisions of a network.

04:06.186 --> 04:09.732
You don't have to pretend to appreciate me
dropping everything to show up.

04:10.065 --> 04:11.692
You expect that, right?

04:12.109 --> 04:15.154
I'll have bourbon on the rocks. Thanks.

04:16.238 --> 04:19.908
So, what's this about?
Late night meeting at a hotel...

04:21.118 --> 04:23.871
No, you see, sorry,
I'm one of those strange guys

04:23.954 --> 04:26.498
who only likes sleeping with women
who are actually attracted to him.

04:26.582 --> 04:27.875
So, no, I'm not hitting on you.

04:27.958 --> 04:29.501
-You see that woman over there?
-Yeah.

04:29.585 --> 04:31.587
That's Cecily.
She's my New York assistant.

04:33.047 --> 04:34.131
I'm sleeping with her.

04:35.090 --> 04:36.342
Okay.

04:36.634 --> 04:37.635
That was a joke.

04:39.386 --> 04:41.305
I'm not worried. I don't scare easily.

04:41.388 --> 04:43.390
-Well, that's abundantly clear.
-Thank you.

04:43.474 --> 04:45.434
-Thank you.
-I guess they know you here.

04:45.517 --> 04:47.186
Yeah, I come here a lot.

04:47.811 --> 04:50.648
So, Bradley, what is your story?

04:51.315 --> 04:52.608
-My story?
-Yeah.

04:52.691 --> 04:55.986
Who knows? I mean, it's probably
the same as a lot of people's stories.

04:56.070 --> 04:59.031
Kid grows up in the country
around a bunch of cows and cornfields

04:59.114 --> 05:04.161
and dreams of a life that's less about
manure and more about ideas,

05:04.244 --> 05:05.412
things that matter.

05:06.121 --> 05:10.209
Only to grow up and realize
manure matters a whole lot.

05:11.669 --> 05:14.546
Actually, I don't think that's
the same as a lot of stories at all.

05:16.257 --> 05:17.424
What's your story?

05:18.968 --> 05:20.760
I'm probably
not supposed to ask you questions

05:20.844 --> 05:25.099
'cause you're technically important,
but... What the hell? You know?

05:25.182 --> 05:27.309
Wow, being "technically important"
is about the best description

05:27.393 --> 05:28.978
of a network executive I've ever heard.

05:29.520 --> 05:33.399
What is my story? Smart kid,
dad left, I took care of my mom,

05:33.482 --> 05:36.902
I vowed to own the world one day
and kick everyone's ass into submission.

05:38.320 --> 05:40.239
How's that working out for you?

05:40.322 --> 05:41.657
Pretty well, actually.

05:42.908 --> 05:43.909
Well, cheers to that.

05:43.993 --> 05:45.286
Hell, yeah.

05:47.830 --> 05:49.748
So, what do you want from me?

05:50.624 --> 05:52.126
Do you treat every business meeting

05:52.209 --> 05:54.086
like you're being interrogated
by an enemy camp?

05:54.169 --> 05:57.965
If you're even a little smart, you know
that's what all business meetings are.

05:58.048 --> 06:02.011
Then why aren't you further along in your
career at this point, if you're so savvy?

06:04.096 --> 06:07.600
"At this point"? You mean I'm too old
to be the young, feisty journalist?

06:07.683 --> 06:10.352
I should have landed somewhere
more substantial by now?

06:10.436 --> 06:11.645
Maybe.

06:12.563 --> 06:14.565
You're incredibly smart,
you're interesting,

06:14.648 --> 06:17.234
you've got that "it" thing we're always
looking for in this business.

06:17.318 --> 06:19.445
What is it? What's held you back?

06:21.739 --> 06:23.240
I don't know.

06:23.324 --> 06:26.160
I mean, probably what you see
as something "fresh" in me

06:26.243 --> 06:28.037
is probably what held me back.

06:28.454 --> 06:30.831
I don't think like other people.

06:30.914 --> 06:34.918
I say whatever I mean. I don't play games.
I don't fit the mold.

06:35.002 --> 06:36.003
What mold is that?

06:36.587 --> 06:37.796
Any mold, really.

06:37.880 --> 06:39.590
Oh, right. A weirdo.

06:40.007 --> 06:42.092
-What?
-I don't mean that in a bad way.

06:43.802 --> 06:47.765
You just wanted to meet me in person
to see if I was crazy or not.

06:49.016 --> 06:50.935
I can see why you do good interviews.

06:51.018 --> 06:52.394
Thanks, I do.

06:52.478 --> 06:55.230
So,
aside from wondering if you were crazy,

06:55.314 --> 06:57.316
here's the other reason that
I wanted to meet you:

06:57.399 --> 07:01.779
I think we might be able to use you as
a field correspondent on The Morning Show.

07:04.156 --> 07:05.950
What, you might be able to?

07:06.033 --> 07:08.994
Well,
I've looked into your past a little bit.

07:09.078 --> 07:13.415
You have moved jobs a lot. You have
a bit of a colorful local history...

07:13.499 --> 07:17.127
Okay, Two-Fucks Jackson is--
I can explain that--

07:17.211 --> 07:18.253
"Two-Fucks" what?

07:18.879 --> 07:21.048
-What?
-What? No, I said it first.

07:21.131 --> 07:22.883
No, I was just kidding.

07:22.967 --> 07:24.969
I definitely wanna hear
about Two-Fucks Jackson.

07:25.052 --> 07:26.512
But right now--

07:26.595 --> 07:29.807
right now I'm just trying to decide
if I should give you a chance.

07:30.808 --> 07:34.353
I wanna use this Mitch Kessler scandal
to reinvent ourselves.

07:34.436 --> 07:36.772
I want smart people
with fresh perspectives.

07:37.564 --> 07:39.149
Are you offering me a job right now?

07:39.692 --> 07:42.111
Well,
I don't wanna step on my producer's toes,

07:42.194 --> 07:45.030
but I have arranged a meeting for you
with Charlie Black tomorrow.

07:45.114 --> 07:46.699
He's the executive producer
of The Morning Show.

07:46.782 --> 07:48.284
-I know who he is.
-Course you do.

07:48.367 --> 07:51.453
Can you be ready for a 9:30 meeting
tomorrow morning?

07:51.537 --> 07:52.830
I can do that.

07:55.207 --> 07:56.292
Good.

07:56.375 --> 07:57.459
Thank you for this.

07:57.543 --> 07:59.628
That's it? I don't get to hear
about Two-Fucks Jackson?

07:59.712 --> 08:03.215
Another night. I gotta start prepping.
I take my work really seriously.

08:03.299 --> 08:05.175
-I knew I liked you.
-Hey.

08:05.634 --> 08:06.969
You don't know me.

08:32.286 --> 08:33.579
Jason.

08:34.288 --> 08:35.748
What are you doing here?

08:35.831 --> 08:38.334
You cannot just
come over like this anymore.

08:38.417 --> 08:39.710
Alex, for fuck's sake,

08:39.793 --> 08:42.588
I have had our daughter on the phone,
freaking out,

08:42.671 --> 08:45.132
asking if I know where you are.

08:45.215 --> 08:47.343
Okay, well, here I am.

08:47.426 --> 08:48.677
I'm home, and I'm fine.

08:49.470 --> 08:52.431
I'll call Lizzy, and
I'll tell her that I'm fine. Thank you.

08:52.514 --> 08:53.849
Where have you been?

08:54.767 --> 08:57.394
I was just-- I couldn't sleep.

08:57.478 --> 09:01.315
I couldn't sleep,
so I just went for a walk in the park.

09:03.025 --> 09:05.069
You went for a walk in the park
in the middle of the night?

09:05.152 --> 09:06.654
-Yeah.
-In the rain?

09:06.737 --> 09:07.821
Well...

09:08.572 --> 09:10.574
-What is going on with you, Alex?
-What--

09:10.658 --> 09:13.202
-Are you okay?
-Yes. I'm okay.

09:13.661 --> 09:16.413
I went for a walk
in the middle of the night.

09:16.997 --> 09:20.668
When else can I go for a walk in the park
without anybody bothering me?

09:20.751 --> 09:22.419
Why are you looking at me like that? I--

09:22.503 --> 09:25.714
Please, I've had the worst day of my life.

09:25.798 --> 09:29.677
I haven't had a chance to process
anything. So I went for a fucking walk.

09:29.760 --> 09:32.012
-Okay, okay. Good. Yes.
-It's fine.

09:32.096 --> 09:35.224
I will see you tomorrow night
for the event.

09:36.934 --> 09:38.059
The fucking event.

09:38.143 --> 09:40.395
Yes. I'm looking forward to it as well.

09:40.479 --> 09:41.981
-Are you?
-Yeah. Good night.

11:33.884 --> 11:35.052
Okay.

11:36.220 --> 11:37.930
Oh, fuck.

11:58.993 --> 12:00.286
Oh, God.

12:08.669 --> 12:10.296
I pushed all your calls
because after the show

12:10.379 --> 12:13.007
you'll meet with the UBA PR team
to review your speech for tonight.

12:13.090 --> 12:15.092
-They reviewed that last week.
-It's from Fred's office.

12:15.175 --> 12:17.636
Can't wait to see you get that award.
I just got a new dress for it.

12:17.720 --> 12:19.179
I can't wait to see it.

12:19.263 --> 12:21.515
Hair and makeup at your house at 3:00.
I put it in your calendar.

12:21.599 --> 12:23.267
I don't care if it came
from Fred's office.

12:23.350 --> 12:26.020
I know what I wanna say,
and I don't need them rewriting it today.

12:26.103 --> 12:27.354
Please go call them.

12:27.896 --> 12:30.441
You can't blame them for being
a little nervous about your speech.

12:30.524 --> 12:33.110
This is the first time you're in public
since this whole thing happened.

12:33.193 --> 12:36.655
Wait. What? You mean you think accepting
an award for leadership in journalism

12:36.739 --> 12:42.244
two days after my cohost of 15 years
is fired for predatory behavior is touchy?

12:42.745 --> 12:45.956
That event is gonna be a roomful
of vultures waiting for you to fuck up--

12:46.040 --> 12:48.667
Why are you stressing me out like this?
Honestly.

12:49.126 --> 12:51.587
Why don't you just give me a stroke
by 7:00? Then I won't have to go.

12:51.670 --> 12:52.921
I need to get out of this!

12:53.005 --> 12:54.298
I understand. But I--

12:54.381 --> 12:55.841
-I need this.
-Okay.

12:58.802 --> 12:59.803
Hey, Sarah.

12:59.887 --> 13:01.472
Did you call me at 4:00 this morning?

13:01.555 --> 13:04.224
I just woke up
and saw this message flashing.

13:04.683 --> 13:05.726
Yeah.

13:06.310 --> 13:09.104
Okay... I need to ask you something.

13:11.565 --> 13:12.942
In your opinion,

13:13.776 --> 13:18.280
the way that the network has been dragging
their feet on closing my new deal...

13:19.490 --> 13:21.158
does that suggest...

13:22.785 --> 13:25.079
anything unusual going on?

13:26.372 --> 13:27.456
Like what?

13:28.791 --> 13:29.917
Like...

13:31.210 --> 13:33.420
them trying to replace me?

13:34.672 --> 13:36.423
Or thinking about replacing me?

13:36.507 --> 13:39.134
Well, it's never a good thing.

13:39.218 --> 13:41.553
But it doesn't necessarily mean
anything like that.

13:43.055 --> 13:45.641
The good news is you have them
by the short hairs now.

13:45.724 --> 13:47.268
They need you in a big way.

13:48.769 --> 13:53.565
Okay, you gotta get that deal closed. And
I want every single thing we asked for.

13:54.692 --> 13:55.693
Are you all right?

13:55.776 --> 13:57.027
I'm fine. I'm fine.

13:57.111 --> 13:59.071
Why does everyone keep asking me that?

13:59.154 --> 14:01.156
I just want what I asked for.

14:02.241 --> 14:05.160
And the most important thing
is cohost approval.

14:06.120 --> 14:08.789
Sarah, I just need to be able
to control the narrative

14:08.872 --> 14:10.541
so that I'm not written out of it.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.627
Alex, why are you afraid of this
all of a sudden?

14:13.711 --> 14:15.212
It's just a feeling.

14:15.296 --> 14:17.423
But it is really, really important.

14:17.840 --> 14:19.383
Cohost approval.

14:19.925 --> 14:22.219
You gotta push that through.
And I mean it.

14:22.303 --> 14:23.345
Get that.

14:23.887 --> 14:26.390
And I wanna hear the minute
that you hear back from them

14:26.473 --> 14:28.434
and not when you feel that I can hear it.

14:29.768 --> 14:30.769
Okay?

14:30.853 --> 14:31.979
Okay.

14:37.693 --> 14:38.694
Yeah. Right.

14:38.777 --> 14:41.572
I never sent a message
that I thought was inappropriate.

14:41.655 --> 14:44.283
These women who have come forward
did think it was inappropriate.

14:44.366 --> 14:47.494
Do you think that that's valid?
Do you think their response is valid?

14:49.204 --> 14:50.372
Of course.

14:51.040 --> 14:54.418
But these women never complained to me
about this behavior.

14:54.501 --> 14:55.919
Yes, but you were their boss.

14:56.003 --> 14:57.796
You were in a position of authority.

14:58.213 --> 15:00.799
Do you think that you created
an environment

15:00.883 --> 15:02.509
where they felt comfortable
coming forward?

15:05.679 --> 15:09.266
Hey. What are you-- No, no.

15:09.350 --> 15:11.560
-We can't do this here.
-But, Daddy, I want it now.

15:11.644 --> 15:13.562
-Come on, no.
-Give it to me, Daddy.

15:13.646 --> 15:16.649
-Please, Daddy.
-Come on, no Veruca Salt today. Not here.

15:16.732 --> 15:20.069
-Come on.
-Give me what I want. Give me--

15:20.152 --> 15:21.528
Claire.

15:22.279 --> 15:24.823
-You don't get to say no, remember?
-Claire, please.

15:24.907 --> 15:27.242
You want me to stop,
you're gonna have to use the safe word.

15:27.326 --> 15:28.577
Okay, "climate change."

15:31.622 --> 15:34.625
-You are serious.
-I am. I'm dead serious. All right?

15:43.175 --> 15:44.593
Okay. Come on.

15:44.677 --> 15:47.263
No locked doors, okay? You know
how bad that would look with you...

15:47.346 --> 15:49.139
Couldn't we be having
a private conversation?

15:49.223 --> 15:51.558
-Come on.
-You know, I need advice about my career.

15:51.642 --> 15:53.018
You don't need a locked door for that.

15:53.102 --> 15:55.562
You don't need a locked door
except for one thing.

15:56.230 --> 15:58.774
You know you and I are something
different from-- Right?

15:58.857 --> 16:01.235
I know that, and you know that.
Nobody else would know that.

16:04.321 --> 16:07.616
Come on, we have to be so fucking careful.

16:08.367 --> 16:10.828
Or we go to HR right now
and just tell 'em.

16:10.911 --> 16:12.413
Well, that would be mortifying.

16:13.914 --> 16:15.582
I mean, what would it look like?

16:17.459 --> 16:21.755
You mean that I'm having
a serious relationship

16:21.839 --> 16:24.091
with a woman half my age who is the PA?

16:24.633 --> 16:26.260
You think that might seem bad?

16:29.138 --> 16:30.139
What are you saying?

16:31.557 --> 16:33.517
-Hey. What's up? Good morning.
-Morning.

16:33.601 --> 16:35.894
-You ready for me?
-Yeah, of course. Come on in.

16:35.978 --> 16:37.896
Come on and get--
Thank you. You can leave that here.

16:37.980 --> 16:38.981
Oh, yeah. Of course.

16:39.064 --> 16:41.525
Thanks for researching the volcano info.
I really appreciate that.

16:41.609 --> 16:45.446
Yeah, cool. Let me know if anything else
erupts that you need me to do research on.

16:45.529 --> 16:46.989
-Will do. You got it.
-Good.

16:48.073 --> 16:50.200
But more importantly,
and most importantly,

16:50.701 --> 16:52.411
we want to ensure
a safe working environment

16:52.494 --> 16:54.830
for everyone who works
on The Morning Show.

16:55.623 --> 16:58.292
No one here knew what
was going on right under our noses.

16:58.751 --> 17:01.295
The next few weeks are gonna be rough.
We are clearly in triage.

17:01.378 --> 17:04.924
We need to be stabilized
by the time sweeps start. That's in--

17:05.007 --> 17:06.550
-Three weeks.
-Right.

17:07.217 --> 17:09.553
I won't lie to you, we are in a bad place.

17:09.637 --> 17:10.930
Jobs, the show,

17:11.472 --> 17:14.308
the network itself
literally hang in the balance.

17:14.391 --> 17:16.977
-It's not, though.
-These guys, Your Day, America--

17:17.728 --> 17:19.813
Dangerously close to us in the ratings.

17:20.230 --> 17:22.983
And that isn't bullshit, that is ad money.

17:23.734 --> 17:26.445
Ad money that supports this network,
supports your jobs...

17:27.029 --> 17:28.238
supports your families.

17:29.531 --> 17:33.160
We're gonna be working round the clock at
the network to find America's new family,

17:33.243 --> 17:37.623
and I expect all and everything
from each one of you in the meantime.

17:38.457 --> 17:41.502
Great, thank you so much, Fred.
All right, everybody, let's get to it.

17:46.715 --> 17:48.300
Where are we with her deal?

17:48.384 --> 17:51.178
She's holding on cohost approval.
But we're handling it.

17:51.262 --> 17:52.930
Jesus. She's delusional.

17:53.847 --> 17:56.934
Start putting together a list of names,
men who can sit next to Alex for now

17:57.017 --> 18:00.145
and also work with someone younger
once she's gone.

18:00.229 --> 18:02.773
Maybe a couple of women too,
for optics in case it leaks.

18:02.856 --> 18:06.568
Couple of days ahead of you. The list
is already in progress. Anything else?

18:09.488 --> 18:11.657
You know,
when you were assigned the news division,

18:12.283 --> 18:15.119
we didn't know we would be facing
the biggest crisis in our history.

18:16.829 --> 18:19.331
Some people would say
maybe you should have.

18:21.542 --> 18:22.793
I know what you're doing.

18:23.334 --> 18:26.796
The fact that you just started here
doesn't give you the leverage you think.

18:26.880 --> 18:30.508
I'm not looking for leverage, Fred,
I'm just stating the obvious.

18:30.593 --> 18:33.429
It would have been better if we knew,
so we could have stopped it.

18:35.097 --> 18:37.683
But we didn't know. Right?

18:40.728 --> 18:41.854
Right.

18:52.364 --> 18:54.575
-Fucker.
-Hey, I got something good.

18:54.658 --> 18:55.659
Yeah? What's up?

18:55.743 --> 19:00.664
I got some insider info. YDA booked
one of Mitch's victims for next week.

19:00.748 --> 19:02.958
-Who?
-Ashley Brown.

19:03.042 --> 19:05.294
Ashley in sound tech?
Jesus, it's been a while.

19:05.377 --> 19:06.920
You think you can get her back here
after all that?

19:07.004 --> 19:09.048
I'm gonna pull out all the stops.

19:09.131 --> 19:12.384
I know this is huge for us. You have no
idea what I already did to get this info.

19:12.468 --> 19:14.762
You know what? Please don't tell me that.
I really don't want--

19:14.845 --> 19:16.639
Okay, fine.
I found it in a fortune cookie.

19:16.722 --> 19:19.600
Sorry. You're right.
This is obviously huge.

19:20.434 --> 19:23.812
YDA can't be booking one of our victims
for a million fucking reasons.

19:25.481 --> 19:26.899
Do whatever you have to do.

19:26.982 --> 19:27.983
I'm on it, boss.

19:28.067 --> 19:29.652
-Rena.
-Yes?

19:30.569 --> 19:33.072
Where is today's schedule?

19:33.155 --> 19:34.156
I'm looking for it--

19:34.239 --> 19:36.283
You mean this one that says
"today's schedule"?

19:37.117 --> 19:39.328
-Yes. Fuck you very much.
-No problem.

19:39.411 --> 19:40.579
Thank you.

19:41.288 --> 19:43.749
"Seven..." Why are we doing this in sev--

19:43.832 --> 19:45.459
Rena, can you get Mia?

19:45.542 --> 19:47.544
Only seven fucking minutes to do this--

19:47.628 --> 19:49.004
Hey, how you hanging in there?

19:49.546 --> 19:51.507
I can't feel my body I'm so stressed out.

19:51.590 --> 19:54.802
I'm like a brain floating in space
with a phone in my hand.

19:54.885 --> 19:58.013
That sounds about right. Listen,
I want you to meet Bradley Jackson today.

19:58.097 --> 20:02.351
Wait. Bradley Jackson who did the show
yesterday? What the hell for?

20:02.434 --> 20:05.229
We're gonna be grooming
some new people, trying different things.

20:05.312 --> 20:07.564
It is a good time to start
grooming some new people,

20:07.648 --> 20:10.192
and I think she'd be a good correspondent,
possibly.

20:11.443 --> 20:14.530
Yeah. No, I understand it's always good
to be grooming people, but...

20:15.030 --> 20:16.907
I mean, right now?

20:16.991 --> 20:20.286
Plus, you saw her viral video, right?
I mean, a correspondent? I don't...

20:20.369 --> 20:22.538
I did see it.

20:22.621 --> 20:24.707
I saw it,
and so did five million other people,

20:24.790 --> 20:27.126
because it was incredibly
fucking entertaining.

20:27.209 --> 20:29.920
She also went toe-to-toe with Alex Levy.

20:30.004 --> 20:33.716
Not easy to do.
We need to open our minds, Chipper.

20:33.799 --> 20:36.635
Come on. What's worked in the past
isn't working now.

20:37.511 --> 20:40.055
My office set it for 9:30.
Let me know how it goes.

20:42.474 --> 20:43.892
-Great.
-Good.

20:50.024 --> 20:51.025
Yep.

20:55.070 --> 20:56.113
No.

20:58.407 --> 20:59.992
Push back.

21:02.244 --> 21:04.913
No coanchor approval.

21:06.832 --> 21:08.250
It's never gonna happen.

21:14.340 --> 21:18.302
No. We're still on schedule. I'm gonna get
your car to take you for your mani-pedi.

21:18.385 --> 21:19.803
-Okay, good.
-You like Julie, right?

21:19.887 --> 21:21.305
-Yeah, she's fine.
-She does great work.

21:21.388 --> 21:23.933
And is Lizzy all set for after school?

21:24.016 --> 21:26.936
Yes, she is. She's gonna meet you there
and she's very excited.

21:27.019 --> 21:28.020
Okay, good.

21:28.103 --> 21:29.146
-Last looks!
-Hi, good morning.

21:29.229 --> 21:30.397
Revised pages. Here.

21:30.481 --> 21:32.399
-Sarah calling. Now? No?
-Thank you.

21:32.483 --> 21:33.484
-Sorry?
-Here's Sarah.

21:33.567 --> 21:34.902
Oh, yes, now.

21:35.611 --> 21:37.404
Sorry. Thank you.

21:37.863 --> 21:40.950
Hey, Sarah, I'm just about to go on air.
Did they cave?

21:41.033 --> 21:42.868
No. They're sticking to their guns.

21:43.285 --> 21:45.829
No cohost approval.

21:46.413 --> 21:48.415
I'm gonna call you back after the show.

21:51.126 --> 21:52.419
Can you hold that?

22:03.305 --> 22:04.640
Alex, where are you going?

22:04.723 --> 22:06.016
Alex, do you need something?

22:06.892 --> 22:08.435
-Is everything okay?
-I'm all good.

22:09.728 --> 22:12.398
-Okay, well, he can't go from--
-Hey.

22:12.481 --> 22:14.191
What are you doing?
We're live in 90 seconds.

22:14.275 --> 22:16.777
I need to talk to Chip.
I need to talk to you.

22:16.860 --> 22:19.113
What is happening? 'Cause you're supposed
to be on the air in, like, a minute.

22:19.196 --> 22:21.573
-Yeah, listen. Hey, hey...
-What?

22:21.657 --> 22:25.327
I need your word that
you will wrap up my negotiation.

22:25.411 --> 22:26.453
I know you're scared, okay.

22:26.537 --> 22:28.580
The whole Mitch thing has turned
everything upside down--

22:28.664 --> 22:31.166
Can I-- Why does no one get this?

22:31.250 --> 22:34.336
The Mitch days-- They're over, all right?

22:34.420 --> 22:37.590
I would like hands-on control
from this point on.

22:37.673 --> 22:39.341
I want cohost approval.

22:40.259 --> 22:42.803
Otherwise, I'm not going on the air.

22:45.431 --> 22:47.933
Let's walk to the stage. We'll just walk.

22:48.017 --> 22:49.435
-We can walk.
-We'll walk, okay?

22:49.518 --> 22:51.645
But I'm not going on air
unless you promise me.

22:51.729 --> 22:53.314
-Can I explain something to you?
-Sure.

22:53.397 --> 22:55.024
You pulling this stunt,
with the network right now,

22:55.107 --> 22:56.483
is not gonna make them
promise you anything.

22:56.567 --> 22:58.402
It's gonna make them think
you are fucking losing it.

22:58.485 --> 23:02.489
Well, maybe you have to lose it sometimes
to get people to take you seriously.

23:04.116 --> 23:05.909
I've known you 15 years, Chip.

23:06.368 --> 23:09.413
We came up the ranks together.
For better, for worse.

23:10.039 --> 23:12.041
Lately it's been for worse, but whatever.

23:13.334 --> 23:16.795
You are the only person that I know
that can push this through for me.

23:17.713 --> 23:19.548
And I know if you promise me,
you'll do it.

23:20.090 --> 23:21.926
So, you've gotta promise me, Chip.

23:22.843 --> 23:24.094
Thirty seconds, guys.

23:24.762 --> 23:28.641
I am trying to protect you, but you
are putting me in an impossible situation.

23:28.724 --> 23:31.226
I can't promise you
I can push this through! I can't. I just--

23:31.310 --> 23:34.229
You got Alison and Yanko. Let them go on.

23:34.313 --> 23:35.356
I'm not going on.

23:35.773 --> 23:38.984
And I don't want you to protect me,
I'd like you to respect me.

23:39.401 --> 23:41.195
What, did you read this on a card?
What are you--

23:41.278 --> 23:42.237
Twenty seconds.

23:42.529 --> 23:44.073
I'm ready to fill in.

23:44.782 --> 23:47.159
-There, Alison. There you go.
-No.

23:47.785 --> 23:50.162
They're--
They're gonna think you are crazy.

23:50.454 --> 23:51.914
I'm not going on air.

23:51.997 --> 23:53.540
Ten seconds.

23:54.333 --> 23:55.417
Nine...

23:56.919 --> 23:58.045
eight...

23:59.046 --> 24:00.130
seven...

24:00.839 --> 24:05.052
All right, I promise-- Fine, fine!
Go! Sit, butt in chair!

24:05.135 --> 24:09.807
Five, four, three, two...

24:11.892 --> 24:14.478
Good morning. I'm Alex Levy.

24:14.561 --> 24:16.021
And I'm Daniel Henderson.

24:16.105 --> 24:18.482
And here are our top stories.

24:27.116 --> 24:29.326
Hey, Bradley Jackson.

24:30.077 --> 24:32.579
Have a meeting with Charlie Black.

24:33.247 --> 24:35.582
Does he go by Chip, or Charlie, or?

24:35.666 --> 24:38.377
Well, Charlie is his professional name,
but he does go by Chip.

24:38.669 --> 24:41.380
Okay, okay. Well,
then I have a meeting with Charlie Chip.

24:46.719 --> 24:48.929
Hey. Hey, Chip, you looking for me?

24:49.888 --> 24:51.515
Yeah. Can you walk with me?

24:51.932 --> 24:54.393
Second day in the anchor chair,
I think it went pretty well.

24:54.476 --> 24:56.103
I'm really excited about The Twist today.

24:56.186 --> 24:58.105
-Can I give you some advice?
-Sure.

24:58.188 --> 25:00.482
-There are opportunities opening up here.
-Yeah.

25:00.566 --> 25:02.568
You know what Mitch had going for him?

25:02.651 --> 25:06.196
He was that guy you didn't mind being
stuck at the DMV next to, you know.

25:06.280 --> 25:09.283
Easygoing, light touch,
smart, yes, but easy.

25:09.366 --> 25:10.784
Now, I think you're great.

25:10.868 --> 25:13.329
Probably the best real journalist
we have in the building.

25:13.412 --> 25:15.539
But I overheard you having
this debate in the hall.

25:15.623 --> 25:18.417
I know how you feel about
the Gilmore Girls musical

25:18.500 --> 25:22.129
being neo-pro-life rights propaganda,
and I get it.

25:22.212 --> 25:24.506
All I'm gonna say is,
don't fucking say it.

25:24.590 --> 25:27.259
That shit is not gonna get you
the coanchor chair, okay?

25:27.343 --> 25:29.136
You got a lot going for yourself
in this race.

25:29.219 --> 25:32.181
The brass is looking at everybody closely.

25:32.264 --> 25:34.683
Don't ruin it for yourself
by being too serious, okay?

25:34.767 --> 25:38.812
Try being a little... softer.
A little more accessible, you know?

25:40.522 --> 25:42.358
You telling me to be less black?

25:42.441 --> 25:44.485
Jesus, that's what you just heard?
Really, Daniel?

25:44.568 --> 25:46.070
-That's basically what you're saying.
-Fuck--

25:46.153 --> 25:49.448
You don't even know you're saying it. This
is what I had to deal with my whole life.

25:49.531 --> 25:52.660
Don't be smarter than other people. Don't
come off too strong, too opinionated.

25:52.743 --> 25:54.620
Daniel, that's not being black.

25:54.703 --> 25:57.247
It's being fucking Morning Show,
Daniel, okay?

25:57.331 --> 26:00.793
Jesus, I'm on your side here. This has
nothing to do with you being black.

26:01.627 --> 26:03.629
That's what you guys always say.

26:05.130 --> 26:06.548
Shit, okay. You know what?

26:06.632 --> 26:09.134
Just do yourself a favor
tonight at the event.

26:09.218 --> 26:11.512
Press the flesh. Schmooze the executives.

26:11.595 --> 26:13.514
Pretend you're the dad
that everybody wants

26:13.597 --> 26:15.641
and don't go after
the beloved Gilmore Girls.

26:15.724 --> 26:18.560
Hey, hey, this chair could be yours.

26:20.312 --> 26:21.522
Okay?

26:22.022 --> 26:24.316
-I hear you.
-Thank you.

26:24.608 --> 26:26.610
-Thank you. Thank you.
-You're welcome. You're welcome.

26:26.694 --> 26:27.861
Yes.

26:27.945 --> 26:29.071
The coal woman is here.

26:30.572 --> 26:32.491
Jesus.
Do we have to do this meeting right now?

26:32.574 --> 26:34.535
Like I don't have a million
more important things to do.

26:34.618 --> 26:36.662
Is Cory Ellison fucking this woman or--

26:37.079 --> 26:39.540
Fucking waste of time. That's it.

26:39.623 --> 26:43.460
I wanna thank you for taking the time to
see me. I know you've got a lot going on.

26:44.211 --> 26:46.171
Sure, it's no problem. Not busy at all.

26:46.255 --> 26:48.465
-I looked at your reel. It was good.
-Thank you.

26:48.549 --> 26:51.885
I noticed you have moved around
last couple of years.

26:51.969 --> 26:55.681
Three years at SENN,
then BDC six months before that...

26:55.764 --> 26:58.851
Yeah, yeah. I understand.
I've been some places.

26:59.351 --> 27:02.146
But really, I'm looking for a platform
where I can get my ideas across.

27:02.479 --> 27:06.025
-Speaking of which, I brought some today--
-Wait, I'm sorry. What do you mean ideas?

27:06.108 --> 27:08.694
I've worked up some stories I think
would be good for The Morning Show.

27:08.777 --> 27:11.405
I'm sorry. I'm maybe a little confused.

27:11.947 --> 27:14.867
You're interviewing to be a correspondent,
right? Not a producer.

27:14.950 --> 27:18.412
'Cause correspondents normally just
present the ideas that producers wrote.

27:18.495 --> 27:21.540
Yeah, I like to do my own producing,

27:21.624 --> 27:25.127
and I think I have some stories
that would do really well on TMS.

27:25.210 --> 27:26.879
So, why don't I just jump in?

27:26.962 --> 27:28.172
Sure, yeah. Okay.

27:28.255 --> 27:30.507
So,
there's a mom-and-pop store in Chicago.

27:30.591 --> 27:32.760
It's about to be replaced by a Target.

27:32.843 --> 27:35.387
The historical society
is trying to block it.

27:35.471 --> 27:36.555
But here's the twist.

27:36.639 --> 27:39.683
The mom and the pop are angry
at the historical society

27:39.767 --> 27:42.394
because they're getting in the way
of them amassing a small fortune.

27:42.478 --> 27:45.272
So, I have a source on the inside
that can tell me--

27:45.356 --> 27:46.774
It's okay. I get the concept.

27:48.400 --> 27:51.654
Okay, well, college admissions.
Not the diversity angle--

27:51.737 --> 27:52.863
Fuck me.

27:55.449 --> 27:56.450
-Sorry.
-College admissions.

27:56.533 --> 27:59.119
But not the diversity angle,
the money angle.

27:59.203 --> 28:00.496
No.

28:00.579 --> 28:02.247
No? Okay.

28:03.916 --> 28:07.211
You know, right here in New York City
they are trying to dedicate a memorial

28:07.294 --> 28:10.673
to the immigrants who died
in the Triangle Fire in 1911.

28:10.756 --> 28:12.633
And the thing about dedicating it
this summer--

28:12.716 --> 28:14.635
You said 1911?

28:14.969 --> 28:17.137
Yeah, that's when it happened, 1911.

28:18.180 --> 28:19.431
Okay.

28:19.515 --> 28:22.851
I don't know how to say this without being
rude, but you're wasting your time here.

28:22.935 --> 28:24.311
Your stories aren't right for us.

28:24.395 --> 28:27.731
It's not even ostensibly what you're here
to discuss anyway, so...

28:28.315 --> 28:30.025
The stories aren't right for you?

28:31.193 --> 28:32.194
I'm sorry.

28:32.278 --> 28:35.489
Were you even listening? 'Cause you look
like you were distracted the entire time.

28:35.572 --> 28:37.408
You didn't even ask me a question.

28:37.491 --> 28:39.326
How are they not right for you?

28:39.410 --> 28:41.745
Are you-- You're being serious right now?

28:42.496 --> 28:43.580
Yeah.

28:43.664 --> 28:44.748
Okay.

28:45.249 --> 28:48.294
They're not interesting.
This meeting is over.

28:48.711 --> 28:51.130
You mean they're not interesting to you?

28:51.213 --> 28:53.799
-Have you seen your show lately, sir?
-Please.

28:53.882 --> 28:57.761
I'm sorry, but this week alone,
I think I saw twins who met on Bumble,

28:57.845 --> 29:01.890
a woman got busted for selling
fake emotional support animal licenses.

29:01.974 --> 29:06.061
And how many ice-cream flavors
are there really? Need I go on?

29:06.145 --> 29:07.563
No, you need to leave.

29:07.646 --> 29:10.107
-Your show sucks.
-Thank you! Thank you.

29:10.190 --> 29:11.358
It's barely news.

29:11.442 --> 29:14.445
You have downgraded it to try and get
some of the Your Day, America audience,

29:14.528 --> 29:15.738
to your own detriment.

29:16.030 --> 29:17.948
You really think this is gonna
help you get a job?

29:18.032 --> 29:19.742
The stories that I brought you are good.

29:19.825 --> 29:22.119
They're human, they're political,
they're engaging.

29:22.202 --> 29:24.955
The Triangle Fire story
is so timely right now,

29:25.039 --> 29:26.915
with immigration issues that are going on.

29:26.999 --> 29:31.045
I'm sorry if lives of teenage immigrant
girls burning alive in a sweatshop

29:31.128 --> 29:32.796
holds no current value to you,

29:32.880 --> 29:34.882
but it might lead you to do
an actual news story

29:34.965 --> 29:38.177
about the sweatshops that exist
all over the city right now.

29:38.260 --> 29:42.264
But God forbid you do that at Morning
Show. It's not feel-good bad news, is it?

29:42.348 --> 29:43.974
You want me to call security?
That's what you want?

29:44.058 --> 29:46.268
-Why? Are you scared of me?
-I want you to leave!

29:46.352 --> 29:50.105
You know what? People like you are
the reason broadcast news is what it is.

29:50.189 --> 29:54.026
Thanks for your time, Chip Charlie Chip.
Whatever your fuckin' name is.

29:54.109 --> 29:55.778
You sound like an ice-cream flavor.

29:56.195 --> 29:59.865
Hey, why don't you put that
in your hard news exposÃ©?

30:03.535 --> 30:04.828
What the fuck?

30:04.912 --> 30:08.707
UBA

30:43.158 --> 30:47.204
I'm gonna be straight with you, Mitch.
Financially, this is gonna be tough.

30:47.288 --> 30:49.498
It's okay. It's fine.
I can tighten my belt a little--

30:49.581 --> 30:51.375
It kind of goes beyond that.

30:51.458 --> 30:54.712
UBA is not going to pay out
the rest of your contract.

30:55.045 --> 30:56.463
-They said that?
-Yes.

30:56.547 --> 30:59.133
Legal sent a violation of contract
document this morning

30:59.216 --> 31:00.509
that made it very clear.

31:00.593 --> 31:04.096
How can I be in violation of my contract?

31:04.763 --> 31:05.764
It was consensual.

31:06.724 --> 31:09.184
-All I can say is that for the--
-Lisa, it was consensual.

31:09.268 --> 31:13.188
For the foreseeable future,
you're not gonna have any income.

31:13.272 --> 31:14.815
Okay.

31:16.233 --> 31:17.276
All right.

31:17.985 --> 31:19.695
Well, what do you propose I do?

31:19.778 --> 31:22.239
You're gonna have to start making choices.

31:22.323 --> 31:27.077
You got the Southampton house, the Aspen
property, your New York apartment. Which--

31:27.161 --> 31:29.830
I'm not giving up that apartment.

31:29.913 --> 31:34.251
You could probably keep it going
at this level for two years, tops.

31:34.335 --> 31:39.006
How is that even possible?
I've made more money than God. Right?

31:39.089 --> 31:41.091
God didn't violate his morals clause.

31:41.175 --> 31:43.886
Morals clause, really?

31:43.969 --> 31:45.846
Oh, wow!

31:45.930 --> 31:47.264
Fuck.

31:47.348 --> 31:49.350
That. What a crock of shit.

31:49.433 --> 31:50.851
Morals clause!

31:51.727 --> 31:53.938
These people back up the Brinks truck

31:54.021 --> 31:58.442
and give you everything that
you've always wanted except for one thing:

31:58.525 --> 32:00.986
there's gonna be a morals clause
in your contract.

32:01.070 --> 32:04.031
Okay. Well, you're not an idiot.

32:04.114 --> 32:07.326
And everybody's telling you they
won't trigger it. They never trigger it.

32:07.409 --> 32:09.244
That's not even--
They're just covering their asses.

32:09.328 --> 32:12.122
And these guys? You've known them forever.

32:12.206 --> 32:17.544
You have worked with them. And they
more than approve of your behavior.

32:17.628 --> 32:20.714
It's fine with them,
as is evidenced by the fact

32:20.798 --> 32:25.469
that they just gave you the most lucrative
deal in the history of morning news.

32:25.552 --> 32:27.429
And you don't want
to be that guy who says,

32:27.513 --> 32:30.933
"No, take the morals clause out, then I'll
sign it," 'cause that sends a bad message.

32:31.016 --> 32:32.726
You know what a morals clause is?

32:33.477 --> 32:35.604
It's a moving fucking target!

32:35.688 --> 32:37.481
It's anything they want it to be!

32:37.773 --> 32:40.526
Yeah? It's as the wind blows.

32:43.195 --> 32:46.448
Oh, wow.

32:47.700 --> 32:50.369
Mitch, I'm your business manager,
not your lawyer.

32:53.372 --> 32:56.083
Morals clause. Morals clause.

33:06.343 --> 33:07.553
Rapist!

33:08.762 --> 33:11.348
What did you say to me?
What did you call me?

33:12.141 --> 33:15.519
Don't walk away from me. You're calling me
a ra--? I'm not even accused of rape.

33:15.603 --> 33:17.855
Sexual misconduct
is what I'm being accused of.

33:17.938 --> 33:20.107
Don't you wave your fucking hand at me!

33:20.774 --> 33:23.068
Have a nice day, you fucking asshole.

33:40.628 --> 33:41.795
Yes?

33:41.879 --> 33:43.839
Hi, Ashley. I'm Hannah Shoenfeld.

33:43.923 --> 33:45.132
I'm with The Morning Show.

33:45.215 --> 33:49.345
Don't worry. It's nothing bad. We think
it's great you want to tell your story.

33:49.428 --> 33:50.888
Then why are you here?

33:51.305 --> 33:53.933
Can I come in?
I promise I'll be real quick.

33:54.016 --> 33:57.811
-I really don't think that's a good idea.
-Five minutes. You can time me.

34:00.064 --> 34:01.649
Look, you have a story to tell.

34:01.732 --> 34:04.944
The entire country needs to hear it,
and we want to give you the platform.

34:05.778 --> 34:07.321
On The Morning Show?

34:07.404 --> 34:08.822
Yes.

34:08.906 --> 34:10.908
Why would I ever go back there?
That place is--

34:10.991 --> 34:15.204
The scene of the crime. I know. And going
back, that takes real fucking courage.

34:15.621 --> 34:18.374
Which you have. Or you wouldn't
be speaking out in the first place.

34:19.375 --> 34:23.337
Look, I find stories for a living.
That's what I do.

34:23.420 --> 34:26.715
And when I look at you,
I can see that story.

34:27.258 --> 34:29.843
The brave woman knocked back
by a powerful man,

34:29.927 --> 34:32.346
reclaiming her power on national TV.

34:32.805 --> 34:36.642
But if you go on YDA,
that's not the story that'll be told.

34:37.309 --> 34:40.604
Yes, it is.
It doesn't matter where I tell it.

34:41.438 --> 34:44.233
I am done with this conversation.
I'm not going back there.

34:45.985 --> 34:47.528
Do I have to call security?

34:47.611 --> 34:49.113
Fine. I'll leave.

34:50.155 --> 34:53.409
But it does matter where you tell it.

34:54.910 --> 34:56.620
You're making a huge mistake.

34:57.955 --> 34:58.956
Why?

34:59.039 --> 35:03.002
Because this is television,
not a women's studies seminar at Vassar.

35:03.836 --> 35:07.673
A lot of people watching are gonna
have ignorant, knee-jerk reactions.

35:07.756 --> 35:09.717
How you tell the story
is the whole fucking ball game.

35:09.800 --> 35:13.095
And if you do it on YDA,
you'll be the angry woman.

35:16.056 --> 35:17.308
Why?

35:17.391 --> 35:21.686
Because YDA's our enemy, and everyone
who watches these shows knows it.

35:22.021 --> 35:26.191
They'll see you as a bitch,
scorned by a powerful network,

35:26.275 --> 35:28.568
rejected by a powerful man,

35:28.652 --> 35:31.155
bitter about her career, her life,

35:31.697 --> 35:33.240
looking for a payback,

35:33.324 --> 35:35.409
desperate to hurt the people who hurt her,

35:35.492 --> 35:39.329
manipulated by a rival show that
just wants to fuck over their opponent,

35:39.413 --> 35:41.332
trotted out like a piece of meat,

35:41.414 --> 35:43.751
and then discarded
when you aren't needed anymore.

35:44.751 --> 35:46.628
And then it's done, and nobody cares.

35:46.711 --> 35:48.088
On to the next story.

35:48.713 --> 35:53.344
No, I can't do this.
I mean, I shouldn't be doing this at all.

35:53.427 --> 35:55.721
Yes, you should.

35:57.472 --> 35:59.141
But if you are gonna do it...

36:00.224 --> 36:04.521
if you are gonna blow the whistle on Mitch
Kessler for being the predator he is...

36:05.606 --> 36:08.484
you have to have the balls
to do it in his own house.

36:09.777 --> 36:11.612
It won't mean anything otherwise.

36:16.492 --> 36:18.160
Come on The Morning Show.

36:19.745 --> 36:21.538
Come back to the killing floor.

36:22.539 --> 36:24.875
Show everyone you have the nerve...

36:26.001 --> 36:28.128
but especially him.

36:38.347 --> 36:39.431
Thanks.

36:44.687 --> 36:46.272
-Hello?
-Hello, Bradley.

36:46.355 --> 36:49.191
This is Cecily from Cory Ellison's office.

36:49.275 --> 36:52.319
Cory would like for you to be at the
Leadership in Journalism event tonight.

36:52.736 --> 36:54.154
It's black-tie.

36:54.947 --> 36:57.783
That's really nice,
but I'm headed to the airport.

36:57.866 --> 37:00.911
We'll take care of rearranging
your flight.

37:00.995 --> 37:02.997
A car will pick you up at your hotel.

37:03.080 --> 37:06.208
Okay, I didn't pack anything I could wear
to a black-tie event.

37:06.292 --> 37:08.419
We're sending a few gowns over.

37:09.086 --> 37:11.005
Okay, Cecily, I'm confused.

37:11.088 --> 37:14.758
I had a meeting with Chip Charlie Black,
and it did not go well.

37:14.842 --> 37:16.677
I'm pretty sure he's not hiring me.

37:16.760 --> 37:19.471
All I know is Cory asked me to call you.

37:19.555 --> 37:22.891
So, between you and me, I'd show up.

37:25.603 --> 37:27.646
Okay, yeah. I'll be there.

37:27.730 --> 37:28.814
Fantastic.

37:41.327 --> 37:43.746
Go around the side. Get the shot.
Come out this side.

37:47.791 --> 37:51.670
-Why are you here?
-Is he going back on air?

37:51.754 --> 37:53.464
What's the latest news on Mitch?

37:57.426 --> 37:58.510
Hey, Mitch.

38:01.055 --> 38:02.723
To what do I owe this pleasure?

38:03.182 --> 38:06.185
Is it already time
for my chemical castration?

38:06.477 --> 38:08.437
No,
I got that slotted in for next Thursday.

38:08.520 --> 38:09.855
Oh, yeah.

38:09.939 --> 38:13.359
Maybe we can fit it in between my tar and
feathering and being burnt at the stake.

38:13.859 --> 38:15.194
You got it.

38:15.611 --> 38:18.781
And by the way, fuck you.

38:22.117 --> 38:23.994
Mitch, you gotta stop calling reporters.

38:24.870 --> 38:27.498
Looks like somebody got
an illegal wiretap kit for Christmas.

38:27.581 --> 38:29.249
No, somebody got slipped the information

38:29.333 --> 38:32.211
that Mitch Kessler has been calling
reporters all over New York City

38:32.294 --> 38:35.172
looking for someone to tell
his side of the story.

38:35.839 --> 38:38.467
What the fuck, Mitch?
I mean, you know you can't do that.

38:38.550 --> 38:41.053
You're toxic,
and you're gonna be for a while, so--

38:41.136 --> 38:45.307
How long do I have to sit around
while I take my punishment like a man?

38:46.809 --> 38:50.354
I don't know. I don't know what the
half-life is on this, but it's not a day.

38:50.646 --> 38:51.981
It's years.

38:52.064 --> 38:54.024
So, you need to hibernate.

38:54.108 --> 38:57.653
I have covered enough of these stories
over the past couple of years

38:57.736 --> 39:00.823
to know that when the Me Too mob
comes knocking at your door

39:00.906 --> 39:01.907
you have two choices.

39:01.991 --> 39:07.454
You can either be contrite
and cry puddles of crocodile tears

39:07.788 --> 39:12.209
and pray till you're blue in the balls
that it'll just magically disappear,

39:12.293 --> 39:14.295
or you can fight back.

39:15.671 --> 39:18.007
And that's what I intend to do, Chip.

39:18.632 --> 39:20.593
I think that's my best course of action.

39:20.926 --> 39:22.553
I'm going to hire a new attorney,

39:22.636 --> 39:25.222
I'm going to get my face out there,

39:25.681 --> 39:28.475
and I'm not gonna hide in shame.

39:29.685 --> 39:30.769
It's gonna work.

39:31.228 --> 39:35.482
Do not show your face tonight.
Do not do that to Alex.

39:35.566 --> 39:36.984
My tux is pressed.

39:37.568 --> 39:39.528
-I can't unpress my tux.
-Yeah.

39:39.612 --> 39:43.115
So, I'm going. And those goddamn
two-faced New York reporters...

39:43.866 --> 39:47.328
I'm gonna walk in and look those
motherfuckers in their beady little eyes,

39:47.411 --> 39:50.748
and I'm gonna say,
"I'm here. I can see you."

39:51.248 --> 39:52.416
Yeah, that's suicide.

39:52.499 --> 39:55.085
And by the way, did I see you yelling
at some woman on the street?

39:55.169 --> 39:57.796
Because it's on Twitter.
You can't fucking do this shit, man!

39:57.880 --> 39:59.965
I have to fight back!

40:00.424 --> 40:03.385
I'm not going to let somebody
slander me again in public.

40:03.469 --> 40:06.180
I get it! You're angry! You're upset!
You're defensive, okay?

40:06.263 --> 40:11.101
But I'm telling you, you are way
too emotionally volatile to walk in there

40:11.185 --> 40:13.228
and make a convincing argument, okay?

40:13.312 --> 40:15.814
And you need to drop this innocent act,
at least in front of me.

40:15.898 --> 40:19.401
I am as innocent
as any straight, middle-aged man there is.

40:19.485 --> 40:22.029
The only problem is,
that seems to be illegal these days.

40:22.363 --> 40:24.657
This is McCarthyism, you know it.

40:24.740 --> 40:25.741
Everybody knows it

40:25.824 --> 40:28.869
but people just don't have the intestinal
fortitude to say it out loud.

40:28.953 --> 40:32.331
I'll say it. We're being too fast to judge
men in the court of public opinion.

40:32.414 --> 40:33.791
I agree with you, okay?

40:33.874 --> 40:36.585
The whole Me Too movement
is probably an overcorrection

40:36.669 --> 40:38.253
for centuries of bad behavior

40:38.337 --> 40:40.673
that more enlightened men
like you and me had nothing to do with.

40:40.756 --> 40:45.427
But, Mitch, do you really want
a detailed probe into your private life?

40:45.886 --> 40:47.721
You think that's gonna exonerate you?

40:48.681 --> 40:51.225
-At first they came for the rapists.
-What are you...

40:51.308 --> 40:54.019
And I did not speak up
because I am not a rapist.

40:54.895 --> 40:57.273
And then they came for the powerful men,

40:57.356 --> 40:59.984
and you did not speak up
because you are not a powerful man.

41:00.067 --> 41:02.069
But what are you going to do

41:02.152 --> 41:06.532
when they come for the ordinary, everyday,
run-of-the-mill creep like you, Chip?

41:08.450 --> 41:10.452
Who's gonna be left to speak up for you?

41:13.289 --> 41:14.957
I'm gonna go now, okay?

41:17.293 --> 41:19.503
Do not show up tonight.

41:19.586 --> 41:21.672
Stop talking.

41:21.755 --> 41:25.467
Start fucking listening,
and do it from home.

41:26.677 --> 41:28.387
Who leaked this to the Times?

41:29.346 --> 41:31.056
Stop talking, Mitch.

41:33.100 --> 41:35.978
And who did you have to blow
to keep your job?

41:38.522 --> 41:41.817
All right. See you in a couple of hours.

41:48.907 --> 41:52.870
I need this. I need my makeup
so I can look like a princess all night.

41:54.246 --> 41:57.124
That's not gonna fit. I need my mints.
I need my phone,

41:57.207 --> 42:00.836
and I need my eye drops, none of which fit
in this teeny little thing!

42:01.295 --> 42:02.546
I can take your phone.

42:02.630 --> 42:05.591
Why would you take my phone?
That's ridiculous, Jason.

42:05.674 --> 42:07.176
You're getting worked up about nothing--

42:07.259 --> 42:10.220
Really? About nothing?
I'm sorry. I need all this stupid shit.

42:10.304 --> 42:12.139
Alex, it's fine. Let me just-- Give me--

42:12.222 --> 42:14.975
-I said I would get it. I can shut it.
-Jesus Christ.

42:15.059 --> 42:15.976
Thank you.

42:16.060 --> 42:17.061
-Mom?
-What?

42:17.144 --> 42:19.063
-It's gonna be okay.
-No, it's not, honey.

42:19.146 --> 42:20.731
Okay, it's just an event.

42:20.814 --> 42:23.233
Really? Just an event?
Only with the worst timing ever.

42:23.317 --> 42:26.236
I would rather stick daggers
into my eyeballs!

42:26.320 --> 42:28.364
-Alex. Alex.
-What?

42:28.656 --> 42:33.035
How about you pretend to have
food poisoning and just don't go?

42:33.118 --> 42:34.787
I cannot do that.

42:35.204 --> 42:38.540
Everyone in there will know that I'm
lying, that I'm uncomfortable and afraid.

42:38.624 --> 42:42.127
That I'm afraid of what's gonna happen
to me on the show in the wake of Mitch.

42:42.211 --> 42:45.214
Everyone in there is press.
They think they know everything.

42:46.423 --> 42:48.217
Half of them hate me
because I'm too successful,

42:48.300 --> 42:50.386
and the other half hate me
because, I don't know,

42:50.469 --> 42:52.805
their hearts are at home in a fucking jar!

42:52.888 --> 42:54.890
Oh, God!

42:56.517 --> 42:58.435
Oh, Jesus, I can't cry!

42:59.103 --> 43:00.688
Jesus!

43:01.146 --> 43:02.314
Oh, God.

43:02.815 --> 43:05.276
-No, stop it, stop it!
-Mom.

43:05.359 --> 43:08.195
-Yeah, well, you can't go out like this.
-I know that!

43:10.239 --> 43:12.116
-Alex, Alex!
-Ms. Levy! Right here!

43:13.492 --> 43:14.535
Hi.

43:18.580 --> 43:19.790
-Okay?
-Yep.

43:19.873 --> 43:25.004
Let's go do this fucking event
so I can go home and just die.

43:45.608 --> 43:47.109
I really appreciate it.

43:52.156 --> 43:54.825
Hey, Alex.
Congratulations on being honored tonight.

43:54.908 --> 43:56.452
-Thank you.
-How does it feel?

43:56.535 --> 44:00.164
It's so meaningful to be honored
by such prestigious company,

44:00.247 --> 44:03.876
and I'm thrilled to be here to support
quality journalism in this day and--

44:03.959 --> 44:08.255
May I just add The Morning Show
is very important.

44:08.339 --> 44:11.258
It's iconic and beloved,
and it is about real journalism

44:11.342 --> 44:13.135
and no one person can change that.

44:13.218 --> 44:16.096
We will survive this disgrace,

44:16.180 --> 44:19.141
and we're gonna help America
get through it like a family.

44:19.224 --> 44:20.225
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

44:22.937 --> 44:24.229
Hey, let's get a picture.

44:26.440 --> 44:29.902
You forgot the part about how I'm the one
that will be pulling America through this.

44:29.985 --> 44:31.612
Well, I think that was implied.

44:33.072 --> 44:35.032
You think a lot is implied.

44:35.908 --> 44:39.370
That's where you hide.
In the implications.

44:42.498 --> 44:43.666
I'm really honored.

44:45.751 --> 44:46.752
Who are you?

44:46.835 --> 44:48.879
Being this personable is exhausting.

44:48.963 --> 44:51.215
I don't think
I can keep doing it for much longer.

44:51.298 --> 44:53.884
Let me take you to the bar
and give you a minute to be an intense,

44:53.968 --> 44:56.095
overly educated, sexy grouch, huh?

44:56.178 --> 44:59.723
I'm feeling good. I'm starting to feel
like I might really have a shot at this.

44:59.807 --> 45:01.392
Keep pressing that flesh.

45:03.602 --> 45:04.979
Hey, Cory?

45:05.396 --> 45:09.650
So, your friend-- Bradley Jackson,
bit of a train wreck.

45:09.733 --> 45:12.569
You're gonna be sorry if you go down
this road. I'd like to report otherwise,

45:12.653 --> 45:14.154
but that's my gut feeling.

45:16.156 --> 45:17.408
Fine.

45:17.866 --> 45:19.159
Okay, good.

45:23.455 --> 45:25.082
Mom, did Hal go to his meeting?

45:25.165 --> 45:28.002
He was supposed to call me after,
and I haven't heard a word from him.

45:28.085 --> 45:31.589
I don't know. He's not home yet.
He left about 1:00 to go to it.

45:31.672 --> 45:33.382
He's been out for seven hours?

45:33.465 --> 45:36.385
Well, he said he was gonna
go by Brandon's afterwards.

45:36.969 --> 45:38.887
Mom, you can't let him see Brandon.

45:38.971 --> 45:40.764
That's like putting heroin
right in front of him.

45:40.848 --> 45:42.558
Bradley, I'm worried now.

45:42.641 --> 45:45.060
I'll call you later.
I just have to do one stupid thing

45:45.144 --> 45:47.771
and then I'm gonna come home,
and I'll deal with this myself.

45:47.855 --> 45:49.565
Okay, I gotta go. All right, bye.

45:50.232 --> 45:52.109
-Hey!
-Glad you could make it.

45:52.192 --> 45:54.111
I'm going to show you to your seat.

45:54.194 --> 45:55.946
You got demoted to usher?

45:56.030 --> 45:58.574
No, I just moved you to a different table.
It'll be fun.

45:58.657 --> 46:02.286
Well, it is thrilling to be here
to support Alex Levy tonight,

46:02.369 --> 46:05.497
even though our shows are ratings rivals.

46:05.581 --> 46:07.958
I mean, when it comes to supporting
women in this business,

46:08.042 --> 46:10.628
we're all in the same boat.

46:10.919 --> 46:13.297
What happened to her was humiliating.

46:13.380 --> 46:16.300
I could never show up
at an event like this.

46:16.383 --> 46:18.677
I mean, to work with a sexual predator...

46:19.136 --> 46:21.138
I don't know what I would do.

46:21.221 --> 46:22.890
Thank God that's not me.

46:27.603 --> 46:29.480
-This is my mom.
-Hi.

46:29.563 --> 46:31.815
-Congratulations. Very nice to meet you.
-Thank you. Real nice to meet you.

46:31.899 --> 46:34.234
For the Gram. It's a boomerang.

46:34.318 --> 46:36.236
It is, yeah. That's so cute.

46:36.320 --> 46:37.404
That's fine. It was great.

46:37.488 --> 46:39.907
-Hi, thank you for coming.
-You look gorgeous.

46:39.990 --> 46:41.325
Thank you, so do you.

46:41.408 --> 46:44.161
Congratulations. How are you, honey?
Good to see you.

46:45.329 --> 46:48.248
We should probably take a seat.

46:50.417 --> 46:52.002
-Thank you.
-There we go.

46:52.086 --> 46:53.253
Okay, and you guys are here.

46:53.337 --> 46:56.423
-Yeah. Lizzy's there, and that's where...
-Okay. And you're here.

46:57.758 --> 46:59.218
-I think that's Chip, right?
-I think so.

46:59.301 --> 47:01.804
Chip. Come here.

47:01.887 --> 47:03.681
-What?
-Hi.

47:04.265 --> 47:06.308
-That your seat?
-Yeah. Why?

47:06.392 --> 47:07.726
There's two extra seats here.

47:08.560 --> 47:11.397
Do you think that they forgot
to take away Mitch and Paige?

47:11.480 --> 47:13.732
I hope that's the worst
of our problems tonight.

47:13.816 --> 47:15.776
Why? Why do you say that?
What are our problems?

47:15.859 --> 47:17.486
Nothing, don't worry. I got it.

47:17.569 --> 47:19.071
Chip, you have to--

47:19.154 --> 47:21.740
Hi, gang. You remember Bradley Jackson?

47:25.828 --> 47:27.413
Here's your seat.

47:27.496 --> 47:29.248
This can't be right.

47:29.331 --> 47:32.418
Last I checked
I was the head of the network. It's right.

47:32.876 --> 47:34.545
-Oh, my God.
-Have a seat.

47:39.383 --> 47:40.384
Okay.

47:40.718 --> 47:41.719
Hey.

47:51.979 --> 47:54.607
I'm not with him, with him,
to be very clear.

47:55.024 --> 47:57.276
Well, that's good news for you.

47:58.611 --> 48:00.446
I actually don't even know
what I'm doing here.

48:01.280 --> 48:03.073
Well, that makes two of us.

48:03.949 --> 48:05.743
I didn't wanna bother you. The--

48:06.702 --> 48:10.414
-What are you doing at this table?
-I don't know. Cory Ellison sat me here.

48:13.417 --> 48:14.418
Okay.

48:15.085 --> 48:16.712
Double? Got it.

48:20.883 --> 48:25.763
Cory, did we not just, moments ago, talk
about how Bradley Jackson is a disaster?

48:25.846 --> 48:27.389
We did. That's correct.

48:27.473 --> 48:30.809
So why is she sitting at that table
over there with our people?

48:31.226 --> 48:34.521
I just thought it might be a good
little wake-up call for Alex.

48:37.066 --> 48:38.359
I see.

49:00.047 --> 49:01.757
Take me home, please.

49:15.896 --> 49:17.481
-Alex.
-Hi.

49:17.564 --> 49:19.984
Congratulations. You look gorgeous.

49:20.067 --> 49:22.444
Thank you, Audra. Thank you.

49:22.861 --> 49:26.824
And I'm so sorry about everything.

49:26.907 --> 49:30.160
Why, Audra? I didn't fuck anyone.

49:32.788 --> 49:34.248
Looking forward to your speech.

49:34.832 --> 49:36.000
Thank you.

49:38.585 --> 49:39.837
Oh, God.

49:49.346 --> 49:53.267
Look, I know it's weird that
I'm at the table with you guys. I...

49:54.310 --> 49:57.396
I don't know what Cory's doing,
but I feel really stupid,

49:57.813 --> 50:01.650
and I feel like I've been thrown around
like a yo-yo by these guys all day.

50:03.068 --> 50:04.403
What guys?

50:06.071 --> 50:08.866
Cory Ellison. I met with him last night

50:08.949 --> 50:13.203
and he wanted me to meet Chip Black
about a correspondent position today,

50:13.287 --> 50:19.084
and now I'm here, for what reason, I don't
know, and then they sat me at your table.

50:19.168 --> 50:22.463
He sat you at my table to fuck with me.

50:23.213 --> 50:24.590
Me fuck with you?

50:24.673 --> 50:26.508
I don't think so. That's just funny.

50:26.592 --> 50:29.553
Yeah, it's funny. They're funny.

50:31.764 --> 50:33.349
Let me ask you a question.

50:33.432 --> 50:35.142
-Yeah?
-Why did you stay?

50:36.435 --> 50:38.437
-Stay where?
-At the table.

50:39.813 --> 50:44.193
If it was so uncomfortable for you,
why didn't you leave?

50:45.319 --> 50:48.155
You're an adult, you have agency.
Why did you stay?

50:53.410 --> 50:56.497
I don't have the right to tell
the head of the network to fuck off.

50:57.831 --> 50:59.124
I'm a nobody.

50:59.875 --> 51:01.210
I'm not you.

51:11.428 --> 51:14.807
Well, hello, Alex.
Are you ready for your big speech?

51:18.143 --> 51:22.022
You know what, Cory? Let's just
cut through the second-party bullshit.

51:22.106 --> 51:24.858
I know we're supposed
to go through our agents and legal

51:24.942 --> 51:27.236
and stab each other off-screen,

51:27.319 --> 51:29.071
but I just wanna say this to your face.

51:31.156 --> 51:34.535
I'm not closing without cohost approval.

51:37.997 --> 51:40.416
Well, I'm sorry to hear that,
because you're not getting it.

51:41.250 --> 51:43.585
We're not breaking precedent.

51:44.086 --> 51:46.714
I'm not putting the network at risk
for future deals.

51:50.884 --> 51:52.303
Then I'll walk.

51:55.598 --> 51:58.225
Then walk, Alex.

51:58.892 --> 52:00.519
I don't want you to be unhappy.

52:05.107 --> 52:08.611
By the way, we bought this award for you.

52:34.553 --> 52:38.891
Alex Levy is synonymous with integrity.

52:38.974 --> 52:41.685
She embodies the vital role
of our profession,

52:41.769 --> 52:46.941
not just in the politics of the nation
or the business of the nation,

52:47.024 --> 52:51.236
but in the everyday lives
of the American people.

52:51.320 --> 52:54.156
Ladies and gentlemen,
the star of The Morning Show

52:54.239 --> 52:59.286
and this year's recipient of the
Leadership in Journalism Award, Alex Levy!

52:59.703 --> 53:01.121
Come on up.

53:39.034 --> 53:43.372
Thank you. Thank you, Maggie,
for those kind and beautiful words,

53:43.455 --> 53:46.375
and thank you to
the New York Media Foundation

53:46.458 --> 53:49.837
for this tremendous, tremendous honor.

53:50.254 --> 53:54.008
But first, I want to take this opportunity

53:54.091 --> 53:59.805
to apologize to all of the women
who were victimized at The Morning Show.

54:00.931 --> 54:05.019
I am so deeply sorry that we did not see
what was happening,

54:05.102 --> 54:09.398
and truth be told, it feels a bit strange

54:09.481 --> 54:14.194
to be accepting an award
for leadership in journalism

54:14.278 --> 54:18.115
when apparently this was going on
right under our noses.

54:19.450 --> 54:20.451
To that end,

54:21.035 --> 54:25.039
I would like to dedicate
this award to those women.

54:32.338 --> 54:34.256
And secondly, secondly,

54:34.882 --> 54:39.345
this is gonna be a new era
for The Morning Show

54:39.428 --> 54:44.683
and for women, for all women,
and unheard voices.

54:45.684 --> 54:49.563
Things are going to be
quite different from now on.

54:50.940 --> 54:56.320
So, I have some exciting news
to share with all of you tonight.

54:56.862 --> 54:58.072
Get out your phones.

55:00.240 --> 55:02.910
I would like to take this moment

55:02.993 --> 55:07.331
to announce my new Morning Show cohost...
