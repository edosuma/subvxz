WEBVTT

00:02.700 --> 00:04.368
This town meeting will come to order.

00:04.452 --> 00:07.704
- No one is listening to me.
- Taylor, calm down.

00:07.787 --> 00:09.872
I can't calm down. I'm being persecuted.

00:09.956 --> 00:13.333
- I promised that we'd hear you.
- We've been hearing you for 20 minutes.

00:13.376 --> 00:16.085
Excuse me, but some of us
have businesses to run...

00:16.169 --> 00:19.130
that don't involve
peddling drug paraphernalia to kids.

00:19.214 --> 00:20.673
It was a lava lamp, Taylor.

00:20.716 --> 00:23.550
There is no use for a lava lamp
unless you're on drugs.

00:23.635 --> 00:25.302
For crying out loud.

00:25.385 --> 00:28.972
Now, we've already agreed
to look into your accusation but to just...

00:29.055 --> 00:30.223
What'd I miss?

00:30.306 --> 00:33.767
Taylor Doose wants the no-parking zone
in front of his store removed.

00:33.851 --> 00:36.186
He says his customers
are being unfairly ticketed.

00:36.228 --> 00:39.231
- No, he just wants to park there all day.
- Genius.

00:39.314 --> 00:42.483
I have been mayor of this fine town
for a long time.

00:42.567 --> 00:45.486
I tend to think of all of you as my children.

00:45.569 --> 00:49.322
Unfortunately, sometimes children
have to be disciplined.

00:49.739 --> 00:53.534
Now, I'm gonna say something,
and I'm only gonna say it once.

00:54.118 --> 00:56.287
We have leash laws, people.

00:56.370 --> 00:57.538
Daddy's getting angry.

00:57.621 --> 01:00.832
- Rover will not leash himself.
- Good point.

01:01.332 --> 01:05.419
I would like to now move on
to something of even greater importance.

01:05.919 --> 01:08.463
As you all know, this coming Friday...

01:08.964 --> 01:12.801
is the anniversary of
the legendary Battle of Stars Hollow.

01:15.761 --> 01:17.387
- Where's Luke?
- There.

01:17.470 --> 01:20.014
Patty will be circulating a sign-up sheet...

01:20.098 --> 01:22.350
for those of you
who would like to participate...

01:22.433 --> 01:25.394
in the reenactment of the aforesaid battle.

01:25.602 --> 01:27.229
He's turning red.

01:27.521 --> 01:28.605
All right.

01:28.688 --> 01:33.192
"It was a frigid November night
some 224 years ago..."

01:33.276 --> 01:34.861
He's shifting in his seat.

01:34.944 --> 01:37.404
"...Hollow Militia
stood in wait for the redcoats."

01:37.445 --> 01:38.738
He's adjusting the cap.

01:38.780 --> 01:43.492
"Tired and hungry, 12 proud men
took their positions in the town square."

01:43.576 --> 01:45.411
He's fighting the urge.

01:45.453 --> 01:47.788
"...and imminent death
in their valiant efforts..."

01:47.871 --> 01:50.873
For God's sake, do we have to
go through this every damn year?

01:50.957 --> 01:52.917
- Yes!
- And the urge wins by a long shot.

01:52.958 --> 01:55.628
I thought we were here
to discuss town issues.

01:55.711 --> 01:57.213
This is a town issue.

01:57.296 --> 02:00.132
- Excuse me, who's talking?
- It's me, Harry. Luke.

02:00.215 --> 02:02.509
You've known me
since I was five years old.

02:02.592 --> 02:05.260
Luke, yes. Sit down.

02:05.803 --> 02:09.348
Now, as I was saying: "12 heroic men..."

02:09.764 --> 02:13.101
"assembled with guns drawn,
ready to meet their maker..."

02:13.184 --> 02:16.937
What are you talking about?
Twelve guys stood in a row all night.

02:16.979 --> 02:19.314
- "...waiting for the redcoats..."
- Who never showed!

02:19.397 --> 02:20.523
Now, just...

02:20.607 --> 02:23.943
Twelve guys stood in a row
waiting for an enemy that never showed.

02:23.984 --> 02:27.279
They got stood up. They should've
been wearing prom dresses.

02:27.529 --> 02:30.448
- I've had just about enough of this.
- Sit down, Taylor!

02:30.531 --> 02:31.783
- Menace.
- Suck up.

02:31.824 --> 02:33.951
- $5, someone ends up in a headlock.
- You're on.

02:33.992 --> 02:37.705
Have any of you considered the fact
that you're glorifying a war we fought...

02:37.788 --> 02:39.831
so we could keep land that we stole?

02:39.915 --> 02:41.917
If you don't like it here in America...

02:42.000 --> 02:46.712
why don't you go stand in line
for toilet paper in the USSR?

02:47.045 --> 02:49.464
There is no more USSR, Harry.

02:49.631 --> 02:52.800
A sense of community
is so important, isn't it?

02:53.051 --> 02:55.428
It's what made our country great.

02:55.511 --> 02:57.680
...if you're so interested in facts.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.074

04:31.507 --> 04:35.177
Lorelai, it's Max. Medina, Max Medina.

04:35.678 --> 04:37.763
And once again we miss each other.

04:37.847 --> 04:40.474
It's now 2.;00 in the afternoon
on Thursday...

04:40.557 --> 04:42.684
and I'm in my office
grading a paper entitled. ;

04:42.725 --> 04:44.519
Emily Dickinson, Get a Life.

04:44.560 --> 04:48.356
Anyhow, as I sit here
losing my faith in mankind...

04:48.730 --> 04:51.399
I wonder if we're ever gonna
actually go on that date...

04:51.482 --> 04:53.025
we talked about many moons ago.

04:53.109 --> 04:55.861
I teach a night class in Stamford
twice a week...

04:55.944 --> 04:59.198
and when I pass that Stars Hollow sign
on the turnpike, I think. ;

04:59.281 --> 05:03.869
"Out there is a beautiful woman
that I someday hope to spend time with."

05:04.411 --> 05:07.580
Anyhow, I'm just thinking about you.

05:08.080 --> 05:10.708
I don't know, maybe next week
we can find some time.

05:10.749 --> 05:12.750
Bye, Lorelai Gilmore.

05:13.209 --> 05:15.836
You knew that. Okay, bye.

05:17.046 --> 05:20.799
Lorelai, it's Max. Medina, Max Medina.

05:20.882 --> 05:23.217
- Mom?
- And once again we miss each other.

05:23.259 --> 05:25.511
- Sorry.
- What are you doing up?

05:25.677 --> 05:28.430
- I couldn't sleep.
- It's freezing in here.

05:29.055 --> 05:31.767
Wait. Close your eyes and breathe.

05:34.560 --> 05:36.062
I smell snow.

05:36.895 --> 05:39.856
- It's that time of year.
- Can't you smell it?

05:40.149 --> 05:42.692
You know, it's like dogs
and high-pitched noises.

05:42.776 --> 05:45.445
I think it's something only you can smell.

05:46.320 --> 05:50.157
- I love snow.
- Really? I had no idea.

05:51.366 --> 05:55.077
Everything's magical when it snows.
Everything looks pretty.

05:55.244 --> 05:59.498
The clothes are great:
Coats, scarves, gloves, hats.

05:59.957 --> 06:02.584
Thermal underwear, wool socks, earflaps.

06:02.667 --> 06:05.878
Do you know the best things in my life
have happened when it snowed?

06:05.962 --> 06:07.588
Why, yes, I do.

06:07.797 --> 06:09.798
- My best birthday.
- Your first kiss.

06:09.882 --> 06:12.175
Your first steps.
They all happened when it snowed.

06:12.259 --> 06:13.343
Feet.

06:15.470 --> 06:19.056
- I feel good. Tingly.
- That's called frostbite.

06:19.473 --> 06:22.183
You are mocking your mother,
the woman who birthed you.

06:22.267 --> 06:24.894
- I'm sorry.
- During a snowstorm, might I add.

06:24.977 --> 06:26.937
So how soon is it supposed to hit?

06:27.938 --> 06:30.441
Tomorrow. Definitely tomorrow.

06:30.899 --> 06:33.318
- Okay, then tomorrow it is.
- What?

06:33.818 --> 06:37.196
You, me, doughnuts, coffee,
standing out in a snowstorm.

06:37.280 --> 06:38.864
- At midnight?
- At midnight.

06:38.947 --> 06:41.115
You are my favorite daughter.

06:42.492 --> 06:44.661
How many times
are you gonna listen to that?

06:44.744 --> 06:46.454
Till it stops being sexy.

06:46.537 --> 06:49.040
Stop. That's my teacher
you're talking about.

06:49.123 --> 06:50.374
I have to respect him.

06:50.457 --> 06:52.792
Okay, if it makes you feel any better...

06:52.834 --> 06:56.462
while he's being sexy,
he's also being grammatically correct.

06:57.046 --> 06:58.714
Better. Thank you.

06:58.964 --> 07:00.257
Sorry, I woke you up.

07:00.341 --> 07:03.134
It's okay. It's all fodder for the tell-all.

07:03.217 --> 07:04.677
Good night.

07:15.937 --> 07:19.690
Lorelai, it's Max. Medina, Max Medina.

07:21.733 --> 07:23.109
How is it out there?

07:23.192 --> 07:26.028
It is cold and gray, like a fat, dead pigeon.

07:26.112 --> 07:28.405
We'll pull out the sleds.
People might want to sled.

07:28.489 --> 07:29.948
We'll need the parkas.

07:30.031 --> 07:31.825
- For what?
- In case anyone wants to hike.

07:31.909 --> 07:36.121
You know not everyone finds the idea of
being pelted with frozen water appealing.

07:36.204 --> 07:38.206
I know, and how sad for them.

07:38.289 --> 07:40.540
The sensation of getting lost
in a blizzard...

07:40.624 --> 07:44.503
of freezing to death in the woods, eating
your friend's buttocks to stay alive...

07:44.544 --> 07:46.379
That is lost on many people.

07:46.462 --> 07:49.423
I am telling you,
five minutes in a snowball fight...

07:49.507 --> 07:52.342
we could knock that stick
right out of your butt.

07:52.426 --> 07:53.926
Okay, how does this sound?

07:54.010 --> 07:56.429
Maple-sugar snowflakes
on all the pillows?

07:56.512 --> 07:58.138
That sounds wonderful!

07:58.222 --> 08:01.725
Make them in the shape of a buttock
to get people used to them.

08:02.058 --> 08:05.186
- Is that a real suggestion?
- Sookie, please, who is speaking?

08:05.227 --> 08:07.855
Michel, right, okay. Snowflakes it is.

08:08.189 --> 08:10.024
I just can't believe it.

08:10.274 --> 08:12.859
I mean, I sat next to him in practice
for months...

08:12.943 --> 08:16.529
and then one day I look over, and it's Rich.

08:17.071 --> 08:18.655
Rich Bloomenfeld.

08:18.739 --> 08:21.824
Where is my chemistry book?
I had it at your house yesterday.

08:21.909 --> 08:23.243
Rory, focus, please.

08:23.326 --> 08:26.329
- I'm sorry. I just can't find my book.
- Hey, babe.

08:26.412 --> 08:28.539
- Sergeant Pepper.
- Mom, do you know where my...

08:28.622 --> 08:30.415
Scary chemistry book is? Behind the desk.

08:30.498 --> 08:31.708
Thank God.

08:36.419 --> 08:39.506
- So, is Sookie in the kitchen?
- And there she'll stay.

08:39.590 --> 08:43.467
- Okay. So, where were we?
- I just met my soul mate.

08:43.927 --> 08:45.887
Right. Rich Bloomenfeld.

08:46.762 --> 08:49.473
Does he still wear the Star Trek shirt?

08:50.015 --> 08:52.809
Remember, you do not
take your eyes off this for a minute.

08:52.893 --> 08:55.770
'Cause the second you do, it will boil,
and then it's ruined.

08:55.853 --> 08:59.023
So just stand there and stare at it, okay?

09:00.357 --> 09:03.151
- Hey, Sookie.
- Hey, kitty-cats.

09:03.235 --> 09:04.527
Cinnamon buns are over there.

09:04.610 --> 09:07.071
Do you have any Rocky Road cookies
you made yesterday?

09:07.155 --> 09:08.489
I can scrounge some up.

09:08.572 --> 09:11.158
- Lane, you need a bag?
- No, thank you.

09:11.241 --> 09:12.701
- Are you staring?
- I'm staring.

09:12.784 --> 09:14.077
Thank you.

09:14.161 --> 09:17.330
So, anyhow, Rich has this amazing hair.

09:17.413 --> 09:19.707
- Really?
- Oh, my God. It's so perfect.

09:19.790 --> 09:23.835
It's thick, but it's not too thick,
and it's got really good natural wave.

09:23.919 --> 09:26.296
So he probably uses way less product
than most guys.

09:26.379 --> 09:27.630
Always a plus.

09:27.713 --> 09:30.090
- What time is it?
- I don't know.

09:30.173 --> 09:32.717
I have to get to the bus stop.
Dean's meeting me there.

09:32.800 --> 09:35.928
- I'm trying to talk to you.
- I know. We'll talk on the way.

09:35.970 --> 09:38.305
- Here you go.
- Thank you, Sookie.

09:38.639 --> 09:42.601
A locksmith's coming to the house today,
like 5:00, and it could take long.

09:42.643 --> 09:44.728
So tell Grandma and Grandpa I'll be late...

09:44.811 --> 09:47.480
and that I'm having Satan's baby?
You pick the order.

09:47.564 --> 09:50.357
I'll relay the time message
but I'm leaving the rest to you.

09:50.441 --> 09:52.734
- You hate Rocky Road cookies.
- I do not.

09:52.818 --> 09:56.153
I'm sorry. That must be
my other daughter, Shmory.

09:56.321 --> 09:58.447
- We're leaving now.
- Wait a minute.

09:58.822 --> 10:01.617
I know who likes Rocky Road cookies.

10:01.658 --> 10:03.743
- Who?
- They're for Dean.

10:03.826 --> 10:07.204
She's bringing baked goods
to a boy. Wow, serious.

10:07.288 --> 10:10.624
Here, Dean, these cookies are for you,
because you're keen.

10:10.665 --> 10:12.750
- Stop.
- Rory's in love!

10:20.924 --> 10:23.135
- We can stop. She's gone now.
- But it's fun.

10:23.218 --> 10:24.469
You're on your own.

10:27.972 --> 10:29.432
I just can't believe it.

10:29.515 --> 10:32.642
I've known him since the sixth grade,
but suddenly he's different.

10:32.684 --> 10:36.646
He's not gangly anymore.
You remember how gangly he was?

10:37.522 --> 10:38.856
I'm sorry. What?

10:38.939 --> 10:41.650
- You're not listening to me.
- I am. I'm sorry.

10:41.734 --> 10:44.527
I just couldn't find my bookmark.
Okay, go ahead.

10:45.361 --> 10:48.781
Here are the problems facing
the whole Bloomenfeld-Kim situation.

10:48.865 --> 10:51.116
One: Hyphenation would be a pain.

10:51.242 --> 10:55.328
Two: He's my band partner.
Romance would be completely awkward.

10:55.370 --> 10:59.831
Three: He's never even looked at me like
I'm a girl or something resembling one.

10:59.874 --> 11:02.876
Four: There's no way I could
convince my parents he was Korean.

11:02.959 --> 11:04.961
But I can't help it. I'm obsessed.

11:05.044 --> 11:08.339
- Did I tell you about his hair?
- It's on his head, right?

11:12.218 --> 11:13.468
Nice hat.

11:15.637 --> 11:18.306
- Here.
- How'd you like it?

11:18.515 --> 11:21.058
I could tell you,
but then I'd have to kill you.

11:21.142 --> 11:24.561
You liked it. You liked Jane Austen.
I knew you would.

11:24.727 --> 11:27.646
- Lane, Dean likes Jane Austen.
- Who would've thought?

11:27.731 --> 11:29.565
I told him he would, but he was all:

11:29.649 --> 11:31.817
"Forget Jane Austen.
Read Hunter Thompson."

11:31.900 --> 11:33.693
You do have to read Hunter Thompson.

11:33.777 --> 11:36.404
Not as much as
you needed to read Jane Austen.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.989
- What's that?
- Just some cookies.

11:39.198 --> 11:40.867
- Rocky Road.
- Yeah.

11:40.991 --> 11:44.036
Wow, she brings me cookies.
How can I repay her?

11:44.119 --> 11:47.663
- How about Charlotte Bronte?
- How about something else?

11:53.126 --> 11:54.336
That's good, too.

11:54.419 --> 11:57.005
Okay, I gotta go.
I'm gonna be late for homeroom.

11:57.088 --> 11:59.632
I have that perfect-attendance certificate
in my sights.

11:59.715 --> 12:01.926
- See you later.
- Yeah, see you.

12:06.262 --> 12:08.889
Ladies and gentlemen, we have flakes.

12:08.972 --> 12:12.642
Flakes have been sighted.
Flakeage, if you will, has begun.

12:13.977 --> 12:16.396
Michel, it's the first snowfall
of the season.

12:16.438 --> 12:19.189
- It's very lucky. Make a wish.
- Get away from me.

12:19.274 --> 12:21.901
You're not supposed to say it out loud.

12:23.693 --> 12:26.779
- Independence Inn.
- The world changes when it snows.

12:26.946 --> 12:30.199
It gets quiet. Everything softens.

12:30.950 --> 12:34.036
- It's your mother.
- And then the rain comes.

12:36.330 --> 12:37.455
Hi, Mom.

12:37.538 --> 12:39.415
- Have you seen the news?
- Ever?

12:39.456 --> 12:42.083
A bad storm's heading your way.
It's already hit us here.

12:42.126 --> 12:44.253
I'll get the ark, you get the animals.

12:44.294 --> 12:46.921
I just sent Lance to pick up Rory at school.

12:47.005 --> 12:49.215
The roads are terrible.
Black ice everywhere.

12:49.298 --> 12:51.967
It's just a mess out there.
I hate this kind of weather.

12:52.050 --> 12:53.427
What time will you get here?

12:53.635 --> 12:54.969
I don't know, let's see.

12:55.053 --> 12:58.431
Black ice, treacherous roads.
I'll wear my red-white-and-blue leotard...

12:58.514 --> 13:00.766
grab my golden lasso,
and fly the invisible plane.

13:01.058 --> 13:02.101
You're not coming.

13:02.184 --> 13:04.936
If it's as bad as you say it is,
I don't see how I'd come.

13:05.020 --> 13:07.772
- I guess it'll just be the three of us then.
- I guess so.

13:07.855 --> 13:10.817
You know, Rory should probably
spend the night tonight also.

13:10.900 --> 13:12.776
- Okay.
- And if it's still bad tomorrow...

13:12.818 --> 13:14.861
Why don't you see
what the weather does...

13:14.944 --> 13:17.780
before filling out
a change-of-address card for her.

13:17.822 --> 13:19.323
- Rory's here.
- Put her on a sec.

13:19.406 --> 13:21.158
Rory, it's your mother.

13:23.035 --> 13:25.453
- Things bad out there?
- It's crazy.

13:25.496 --> 13:27.163
There's snow coming down everywhere...

13:27.246 --> 13:29.957
and saddle shoes
are not the best all-weather footwear.

13:30.165 --> 13:31.792
- You fell.
- Twice.

13:32.084 --> 13:35.461
- Yikes. I'm sorry.
- So, are you coming over tonight?

13:35.504 --> 13:37.838
No, I'm pretty much stuck
in the Hollow tonight.

13:37.922 --> 13:40.299
Bummer. We can take our snow walk
tomorrow night?

13:40.382 --> 13:41.425
Absolutely.

13:41.508 --> 13:44.511
Tell Grandma you arrived there
not a member of the Junior League.

13:44.594 --> 13:46.388
I'd like you to leave there the same way.

13:46.471 --> 13:49.056
- Call if you get Ionely.
- I will. Bye.

13:56.646 --> 13:59.023
Stop this before somebody
drives through town...

13:59.106 --> 14:02.109
and thinks the local mental institution
has bad padlocks.

14:02.192 --> 14:06.321
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Your father was a reenactor.

14:07.196 --> 14:09.656
Yes, and I thought he was crazy also.

14:09.741 --> 14:12.201
- Who's stepping on my musket?
- That'd be me.

14:12.242 --> 14:13.702
Well, stop it.

14:20.332 --> 14:22.709
There goes the fire chief, the police chief...

14:22.792 --> 14:26.046
and the one paramedic
with a valid license. I feel safe. Don't you?

14:26.129 --> 14:28.297
Look at them.
All relatively intelligent men...

14:28.381 --> 14:31.050
but there they are,
dressed up in costumes...

14:31.133 --> 14:33.636
standing out in a snowstorm,
and for what?

14:33.719 --> 14:36.013
Because it's tradition.

14:36.304 --> 14:39.557
Tradition is a trap allowing people
to stick their head in the sand.

14:39.641 --> 14:42.476
Everything in the past was so quaint,
so charming.

14:42.560 --> 14:44.895
Times were simpler. Kids didn't have sex.

14:44.978 --> 14:47.730
Neighbors knew each other.
It's a freaking fairy tale.

14:47.814 --> 14:50.566
Things sucked then, too.
It sucked without indoor plumbing.

14:50.649 --> 14:53.026
I think some traditions are nice.

14:53.069 --> 14:54.903
Birthdays, holidays...

14:54.987 --> 14:57.280
taking a walk
in the first snow of the season.

14:57.364 --> 14:59.616
I didn't get the Hallmark card for that one.

14:59.699 --> 15:02.326
When I was five,
I had a really bad ear infection...

15:02.409 --> 15:05.620
and I had been home in bed for a week,
and I was very sad.

15:05.704 --> 15:09.374
So I wished really hard that something
wonderful would happen to me.

15:09.666 --> 15:12.960
I woke up the next morning,
and it had snowed.

15:13.502 --> 15:16.671
And I was sure that some fairy godmother
had done it just for me.

15:16.755 --> 15:18.172
It was my little present.

15:18.255 --> 15:20.549
Your parents didn't explain
the concept of weather?

15:20.632 --> 15:24.094
I am making a point, Mouthy McGee.
Of course, many years later...

15:24.178 --> 15:28.389
I realized that, logically,
the snow was not there for me personally.

15:28.931 --> 15:32.393
But still, when it snows,
something inside me says:

15:33.435 --> 15:37.188
"Hey, that's your present."
I don't think it'll ever change.

15:40.065 --> 15:42.651
- My father used to be one of those guys.
- Yeah?

15:42.735 --> 15:45.404
- Yeah, he even had his own musket.
- Really?

15:45.487 --> 15:47.239
Never had to rent it.

15:47.405 --> 15:50.158
- Where's the musket now?
- He was buried with it.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.701
Yeah, he loved that musket.

15:53.619 --> 15:56.329
That's nice, in a disturbing sort of way.

15:59.498 --> 16:02.001
Come on in. I'll get you some coffee.

16:02.084 --> 16:03.335
No, thanks.

16:03.418 --> 16:06.588
I'm gonna walk around.
Enjoy my present a little.

16:13.511 --> 16:17.472
People, please get into formation.

16:17.639 --> 16:20.766
Hats on and instruments in place.

16:20.975 --> 16:22.977
Do not, I repeat...

16:23.060 --> 16:26.647
do not actually put instruments
to your mouths...

16:26.730 --> 16:28.857
until we are inside.

16:29.065 --> 16:32.235
Remember what happened
to the flautist last year.

17:13.852 --> 17:15.604
I smell snow.

17:30.491 --> 17:32.534
- What's up, Teach?
- What are you doing here?

17:32.618 --> 17:34.203
I live here. What are you doing here?

17:34.286 --> 17:37.288
I was on my way back from Stamford.
My car decided to stop.

17:37.372 --> 17:38.498
- Here?
- Yes.

17:38.581 --> 17:39.791
- In my town?
- Yes.

17:39.874 --> 17:41.125
Good car.

17:41.250 --> 17:43.585
- It's nice to see you.
- You, too.

17:44.336 --> 17:47.214
You know, a minute ago
I was really angry about something...

17:47.297 --> 17:49.507
and now I just can't remember
what it was.

17:49.591 --> 17:52.009
- That's snow for you.
- I guess so.

17:52.510 --> 17:55.095
So, this is quite a predicament you're in.

17:55.178 --> 17:58.473
Stranded here in a strange town
with no one you know.

17:58.515 --> 17:59.640
Wait.

17:59.682 --> 18:02.810
- Where's Rory tonight?
- She's in Hartford with her grandparents.

18:02.851 --> 18:04.686
- That must be nice.
- Whatever you say.

18:04.770 --> 18:06.688
- So Rory's in Hartford?
- Yes.

18:06.730 --> 18:08.606
- And I'm in Stars Hollow.
- Correct.

18:08.690 --> 18:10.983
- And you're...
- Thinking where I should take you.

18:11.026 --> 18:12.776
No, where I should take you.

18:12.860 --> 18:15.404
This is my town.
You know nothing around here.

18:15.488 --> 18:18.115
No, but I was the one
who asked you out initially...

18:18.198 --> 18:20.575
so therefore I am still obligated
to do the taking.

18:20.658 --> 18:23.661
But I was the one who did the canceling
after you did the asking.

18:23.744 --> 18:27.122
Therefore you forfeit
your taking rights to me, the canceller.

18:27.205 --> 18:29.749
- So we're actually gonna do this?
- Yes, we are.

18:29.832 --> 18:32.501
Let me just give this guy my keys,
and then we'll go.

18:32.543 --> 18:34.795
- Great.
- "Great" is an understatement.

18:35.128 --> 18:38.589
I just don't understand
why you waited so late to call.

18:39.382 --> 18:40.883
Are you sure?

18:42.009 --> 18:45.137
Fine. All right. Yes, goodbye.

18:45.846 --> 18:47.722
I don't know what I'm gonna do now.

18:47.764 --> 18:49.224
What's the problem, Emily?

18:49.265 --> 18:53.227
The problem is that apparently Florence
cannot get here because of the storm.

18:54.561 --> 18:55.937
Our cook.

18:56.438 --> 18:58.398
We'll just have to go out, then.

18:58.481 --> 19:02.443
Please, Richard, pay attention.
We can't go out. It's miserable out there.

19:02.526 --> 19:04.278
We'll figure something out.

19:04.361 --> 19:06.113
What? What will we figure out?

19:06.196 --> 19:08.407
- I don't know, but...
- I hate the damn snow.

19:08.490 --> 19:11.075
- Emily, calm down.
- This is a serious problem.

19:11.158 --> 19:14.870
These Friday dinners are the only
proper food that child eats all week.

19:14.912 --> 19:17.914
Rory, are you in any way malnourished...

19:17.997 --> 19:22.043
or in need of some international
relief organization to recruit a celebrity...

19:22.126 --> 19:24.211
to raise money on your account?

19:24.586 --> 19:26.755
- I'm good.
- She's good, Emily.

19:26.963 --> 19:30.508
Your sense of humor rears its ugly head
at the oddest of times, Richard.

19:30.591 --> 19:34.428
I'm not the mastermind behind some
great scheme to spoil your dinner plans...

19:34.470 --> 19:36.472
and I don't care to be treated as such.

19:36.555 --> 19:39.391
So you're fine with
having no dinner tonight, is that it?

19:39.432 --> 19:42.560
- I certainly am not.
- How about I check the fridge?

19:42.602 --> 19:45.438
I'm sure there's something in there
we could whip up.

19:45.479 --> 19:47.730
- Whip up?
- Yeah, come on.

19:49.107 --> 19:50.817
It'll be fun, I promise.

19:51.192 --> 19:53.694
Come on, Mr. We'Il-figure-it-out.

19:57.781 --> 19:59.366
- Nothing.
- Not a blessed thing.

19:59.449 --> 20:00.575
There's frozen pizza.

20:00.616 --> 20:03.369
- How did that get there?
- Maybe you bought it and forgot.

20:03.452 --> 20:05.913
I've never bought frozen pizza.
It must belong to Anna.

20:05.996 --> 20:07.163
- The maid.
- Yes.

20:07.248 --> 20:08.456
Got one!

20:10.041 --> 20:12.710
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna make it.

20:12.794 --> 20:15.421
- You're not serious.
- That hardly looks like dinner.

20:15.504 --> 20:19.424
I agree. Rory, that's food you eat
at a carnival or in a Turkish prison.

20:19.466 --> 20:20.800
I promise you'll love it.

20:20.841 --> 20:23.094
- But...
- Listen, just leave it up to me.

20:23.135 --> 20:27.097
You guys go back to the living room,
and I'll call you when it's ready.

20:27.972 --> 20:29.891
- Grandma?
- Yes?

20:29.974 --> 20:32.727
What are the odds you'd know
where a cookie sheet would be?

20:32.810 --> 20:35.938
- I'd say very slim.
- Never mind. I'll find it.

20:36.480 --> 20:38.648
Very slim? Thank you for that.

20:39.316 --> 20:41.650
Thank you. Hold that.

20:42.735 --> 20:43.944
Thanks.

20:45.821 --> 20:48.740
- God, it's a beautiful night.
- Yes, it is.

20:48.990 --> 20:51.826
- So, tell me something about yourself.
- Like what?

20:52.159 --> 20:53.786
- Have you ever been married?
- Nope.

20:53.869 --> 20:54.995
- Ever been close?
- Once.

20:55.079 --> 20:56.497
- And?
- She's in Thailand.

20:56.538 --> 20:57.914
- Sex trade?
- Bank of America.

20:57.998 --> 20:59.207
It's usually one or the other.

20:59.291 --> 21:02.293
She went there on business.
She did well. She never came back.

21:02.335 --> 21:03.961
- Sad.
- It was, at the time.

21:04.003 --> 21:07.256
- But if it was meant to be...
- He believes in fate.

21:07.339 --> 21:10.216
Fate, poetry, love.
They all go together, don't they?

21:10.299 --> 21:11.468
Yes, they do.

21:11.509 --> 21:13.761
- How about you?
- I've never been married.

21:13.844 --> 21:16.221
- Ever been close?
- Rory's dad proposed.

21:16.304 --> 21:19.432
- What happened?
- The bell rang. I was late for chem lab.

21:19.516 --> 21:21.309
You ever sorry that you didn't?

21:21.350 --> 21:25.229
No, we were so young and my life
would've been completely different.

21:25.313 --> 21:27.814
You know, I wouldn't live here.
I wouldn't work here.

21:27.856 --> 21:30.400
I wouldn't be walking here with you.

21:33.528 --> 21:35.863
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

21:36.321 --> 21:38.615
Are we gonna get there before we freeze?

21:38.698 --> 21:41.325
What kind of fun would it be
if I told you the answer?

21:41.368 --> 21:42.868
- You're crazy.
- Very possible.

21:42.910 --> 21:44.579
- And I'm following you.
- Yes, you are.

21:44.662 --> 21:47.957
- So possibly I'm crazier then you are.
- Again, very possible.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.916
- A match made in heaven.
- Or in Bellevue.

21:49.999 --> 21:51.626
It must be fate.

21:51.877 --> 21:54.003
This is getting ridiculous, Aaron.

21:54.045 --> 21:57.673
I will not continue to have
these conversations with a child.

21:57.756 --> 21:59.508
Yes, he is a child.

21:59.674 --> 22:02.551
When he's worked 30 years
at the company, he won't be a child.

22:02.636 --> 22:05.638
Until then,
I don't care what his opinions are.

22:05.929 --> 22:07.764
Aaron, are you listening to me?

22:07.847 --> 22:09.974
Good, because I'm hanging up
on you now...

22:10.058 --> 22:12.936
and I wanted to make sure
that you heard it.

22:13.102 --> 22:14.395
What a moron.

23:11.067 --> 23:12.443
Hello, Rory?

23:13.611 --> 23:16.030
- Where are you?
- I'm at my grandparents'.

23:16.113 --> 23:17.447
What are you doing at my house?

23:17.489 --> 23:19.950
- Like you care.
- What are you talking about?

23:20.033 --> 23:21.868
You're never around when I need you.

23:21.951 --> 23:24.328
You know I have to go
to my grandparents' on Fridays.

23:24.412 --> 23:27.290
I know. You go to your grandparents'.
You go to Chilton.

23:27.331 --> 23:30.583
You have to meet Dean. He needs
his cookies. "I can't find my books."

23:30.625 --> 23:31.959
What are you taking about?

23:32.043 --> 23:34.628
Why have a best friend
when she's never around...

23:34.712 --> 23:37.756
never listens, has no interest
in the fact that you're in love...

23:37.797 --> 23:40.425
- or that you touched his hair?
- You touched whose hair?

23:43.136 --> 23:45.471
Why would you touch
Rich Bloomenfeld's hair?

23:45.513 --> 23:48.932
Why? That's a good question.
I don't know why.

23:48.974 --> 23:52.811
Why would a sane person
do a thing like that? Maybe I'm not sane.

23:52.852 --> 23:54.896
Maybe I'm going through
some sort of phase.

23:54.979 --> 23:59.108
Maybe I really needed someone to talk to
about this, and you weren't there.

23:59.316 --> 24:00.525
Lane, come on.

24:00.650 --> 24:03.986
You're always at school,
or you're talking about school...

24:04.028 --> 24:05.446
or you're with Dean.

24:05.488 --> 24:07.615
You have everything now,
and I have nothing...

24:07.698 --> 24:11.326
except for 2,000 Korean Bibles
and a potential "F" in jazz band.

24:11.535 --> 24:12.702
I'm sorry.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.870
Don't be sorry. Be here.

24:17.081 --> 24:19.541
Lane? Are you there?

24:23.002 --> 24:25.213
- There you are.
- I think the phones went dead.

24:25.296 --> 24:27.422
It's probably just this horrible storm.

24:27.506 --> 24:30.759
- You must come downstairs immediately.
- What's wrong?

24:30.842 --> 24:33.511
- The stove is buzzing.
- It's just the timer, Grandma.

24:33.595 --> 24:36.472
I know it's the timer.
I don't know where it's located...

24:36.514 --> 24:39.474
- or how to turn it off.
- But I really need to call Lane back.

24:39.516 --> 24:42.060
You can do nothing.
The phones will eventually come back.

24:42.143 --> 24:44.812
Please come downstairs
and help me stop the buzzing.

24:44.854 --> 24:47.439
Emily, for heaven's sake, get down here.

24:47.523 --> 24:48.816
Okay, let's go.

24:52.569 --> 24:54.779
So, the fiesta burger...

24:54.863 --> 24:56.322
Very interesting.

24:56.363 --> 24:58.240
- Very spicy?
- Oh, yeah.

24:58.740 --> 25:01.493
- How's your tongue?
- Much better, thank you.

25:06.414 --> 25:08.624
- Are you scared yet?
- Not yet.

25:09.708 --> 25:12.252
- Are you scared yet?
- I'm still good.

25:12.335 --> 25:13.503
Are you scared yet?

25:13.545 --> 25:15.880
- You're very annoying in a movie.
- I know.

25:15.963 --> 25:18.799
I think it's very important
that you know my faults...

25:18.882 --> 25:21.968
as well as my many attributes.

25:22.052 --> 25:24.846
- Very thoughtful of you.
- It is, isn't it?

25:25.763 --> 25:27.515
Because, as you know...

25:27.598 --> 25:30.058
you can get carried away
by your many attributes...

25:30.142 --> 25:32.477
and suddenly find yourself thinking,
"Oh, my God!"

25:32.560 --> 25:35.229
"This woman is absolutely perfect."

25:36.772 --> 25:39.358
We wouldn't want that, now, would we?

25:40.150 --> 25:41.985
No, we wouldn't.

25:55.955 --> 25:58.665
You want to eat it before it gets cold.

26:00.042 --> 26:02.002
- How is it?
- Not cold.

26:02.961 --> 26:04.587
It's quite tasty.

26:04.962 --> 26:07.339
- Emily, we should have this more often.
- What?

26:07.381 --> 26:10.508
Perhaps instead of that horrible salmon
that keeps showing up.

26:10.550 --> 26:12.885
That salmon is a fine delicacy.

26:13.470 --> 26:15.096
Po-tay-to, po-tah-to.

26:15.179 --> 26:17.390
Try it again, Grandma.
It's probably cooler now.

26:17.473 --> 26:19.600
- No, thank you. I'm fine.
- You know what?

26:19.683 --> 26:23.019
It's really good
if you add some extra Parmesan to it.

26:23.061 --> 26:24.771
This is Mom's special trick.

26:24.854 --> 26:27.022
Frozen pizza is a staple at our house.

26:27.064 --> 26:30.400
Mom's become a major doctoring genius.
She'll put anything on it.

26:30.483 --> 26:33.111
One time Sookie came
and brought us some foie gras...

26:33.195 --> 26:35.988
- and mom stuck it on a pizza.
- How was it?

26:36.364 --> 26:38.991
Pretty good once we took the foie gras off.

26:40.200 --> 26:41.869
Okay, that's good.

26:42.994 --> 26:45.246
Try it. Please?

26:47.623 --> 26:50.834
If you want to get really crazy,
you can pick it up.

26:50.917 --> 26:52.544
Well, all right.

26:53.420 --> 26:55.046
Here goes nothing.

26:58.757 --> 27:00.884
- That's wonderful!
- See?

27:00.967 --> 27:03.011
Rory, pass me that cheese.

27:04.929 --> 27:06.222
Trust me.

27:07.140 --> 27:09.266
It makes all the difference.

27:09.516 --> 27:11.351
I'll be right back.

27:19.733 --> 27:21.443
I found this in Mom's room.

27:21.526 --> 27:23.445
- What's that?
- Pictures.

27:23.904 --> 27:26.197
Oh, my goodness,
I haven't seen that in years.

27:26.281 --> 27:27.781
Oh, my gosh.

27:30.493 --> 27:31.701
Look at this.

27:32.160 --> 27:33.828
That's one fluffy white dress.

27:33.912 --> 27:35.830
There were 12 petticoats underneath it.

27:35.913 --> 27:38.081
We got it in London, remember, Richard?

27:38.165 --> 27:39.624
She looks like a little princess.

27:39.666 --> 27:42.836
I believe about two minutes
after that picture was taken...

27:42.919 --> 27:45.255
Her Highness dumped
a glass of grape juice over it.

27:45.296 --> 27:47.590
- Look, Emily, it's Hopey.
- Hopey?

27:47.632 --> 27:48.757
My younger sister.

27:48.840 --> 27:50.842
Have I ever seen her?
I don't remember her.

27:50.926 --> 27:53.428
She lives in Paris. Our great expatriate.

27:53.470 --> 27:56.639
Hopey, look at you.
I haven't seen her in such a long time.

27:56.764 --> 27:59.641
- Maybe we should take a trip this year.
- That would be nice.

27:59.725 --> 28:03.311
- Maybe Rory could go with us.
- I'll start packing tomorrow.

28:04.187 --> 28:05.981
- Is that you guys?
- Yes, it is.

28:06.064 --> 28:08.649
- That is our wedding picture.
- That's an amazing dress.

28:08.732 --> 28:12.319
It should've been. My mother had three
seamstresses working round the clock.

28:12.402 --> 28:15.363
- You still have it?
- It's upstairs packed away somewhere.

28:15.447 --> 28:16.823
I'll save it for you if you like.

28:16.906 --> 28:20.033
Rory's too young
to be thinking about things like that.

28:20.117 --> 28:23.411
Every young girl thinks about her wedding.
I know I did.

28:23.495 --> 28:26.163
I knew when I was 12
that I wanted lilies and orchids...

28:26.247 --> 28:28.624
with a silver bow wrapped around them
for my bouquet.

28:28.666 --> 28:31.001
You also knew
that you wanted to marry Errol Flynn.

28:31.084 --> 28:34.796
- Grandma had a thing for the pirate guy?
- I did not.

28:34.837 --> 28:36.339
She was mad about him.

28:36.380 --> 28:38.674
She tried to get me to grow
one of those mustaches.

28:38.757 --> 28:40.176
- You're kidding.
- Richard, stop.

28:40.217 --> 28:42.261
She wanted me
to swing from a chandelier.

28:42.344 --> 28:43.470
Now you're just being silly.

28:43.511 --> 28:45.846
Luckily, I was on the fencing team
at college...

28:45.930 --> 28:49.057
or I would have married
Lucinda Lester by now.

28:49.516 --> 28:52.977
Actually, Lucinda Lester
looked a lot like Errol Flynn.

28:54.020 --> 28:57.356
I should have married her.
It would have been very modern of me.

28:58.023 --> 29:00.358
Mom looks really beautiful here.

29:00.985 --> 29:03.612
- Yes, she does.
- What was the occasion?

29:04.446 --> 29:06.531
Who would like some coffee?

29:07.031 --> 29:09.491
That was her debutante gown
for her coming-out party.

29:09.533 --> 29:12.494
- Mom had a coming-out party?
- No, she didn't.

29:17.123 --> 29:19.708
Yes, well, things happen, don't they?

29:19.791 --> 29:22.627
If you'll excuse me,
I have some business calls to make.

29:22.710 --> 29:24.671
I'll go get that coffee.

29:49.650 --> 29:51.402
- Here.
- What is this?

29:51.568 --> 29:53.903
- I brought you coffee.
- No, thank you.

29:53.987 --> 29:56.489
Harry, you're freezing.
Take the damn coffee.

29:56.572 --> 29:59.491
When our forefathers stood out here
many moons ago...

29:59.575 --> 30:02.035
- they didn't have any coffee.
- How do you know?

30:02.118 --> 30:04.746
Do you have written documentation
about what beverages...

30:04.830 --> 30:08.791
they did or did not have on that long,
historic night of standing?

30:08.874 --> 30:11.585
This is still a joke to you, young man.

30:11.626 --> 30:15.088
I don't choose to be a joke.
We don't need your coffee.

30:15.254 --> 30:18.508
Harry, please. Take the coffee.

30:21.092 --> 30:23.220
My father would have taken the coffee.

30:23.303 --> 30:25.722
Well, all right, then. Thank you.

30:28.140 --> 30:30.142
- Andrew?
- Thank you, Luke.

30:30.767 --> 30:32.811
- Kirk?
- You got any herbal tea?

30:32.894 --> 30:34.770
Not on me, but I can get some.

30:34.855 --> 30:36.772
- With a squeeze of lemon.
- Okay.

30:36.856 --> 30:38.858
I could really go for some cocoa.

30:38.941 --> 30:40.776
- That sounds good.
- Cocoa for me, too.

30:40.860 --> 30:43.903
Okay, hang on a minute. One herbal tea...

30:43.945 --> 30:46.447
and two cocoas.

30:49.116 --> 30:51.576
- Yeah, that part was a little slow.
- Slow?

30:51.619 --> 30:55.204
But it picked up pretty soon after that,
don't you think?

31:08.174 --> 31:10.717
- So this is it, my house.
- Nice.

31:10.801 --> 31:12.136
Thank you.

31:13.303 --> 31:14.637
Good porch.

31:16.472 --> 31:17.932
Nice windows.

31:21.352 --> 31:22.811
Front door.

31:23.687 --> 31:25.771
- Which opens, I assume.
- Yeah.

31:26.564 --> 31:28.816
- Something wrong?
- No, nothing's wrong.

31:28.899 --> 31:31.234
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I...

31:33.237 --> 31:35.864
I was so excited about the snow,
and about seeing you...

31:35.947 --> 31:38.950
- Thank you.
...that I didn't really think this thing out.

31:38.991 --> 31:41.160
And I usually think this kind of thing out.

31:41.243 --> 31:44.662
- So I'm just thinking this thing out.
- What thing?

31:45.163 --> 31:47.957
- Inviting a man over to my house.
- Okay.

31:48.249 --> 31:51.126
See, I have really strict rules about dating.

31:51.168 --> 31:55.380
I keep my personal life totally separate
from my life with Rory.

31:55.713 --> 31:57.924
I never want her to feel unsettled...

31:58.007 --> 32:00.760
or like her life could just shift
at any moment.

32:00.843 --> 32:02.386
I totally understand.

32:02.469 --> 32:04.972
And she comes first,
and this her house, too.

32:05.055 --> 32:08.433
I understand.
This is something that you don't do often.

32:08.516 --> 32:09.892
- Ever.
- Ever?

32:10.142 --> 32:11.644
- Never.
- I see.

32:14.104 --> 32:15.730
I mean, I've dated.

32:15.814 --> 32:18.357
And, you know, dated.

32:20.109 --> 32:23.112
But I've just never dated...

32:23.695 --> 32:26.489
here, in our house.

32:26.865 --> 32:30.701
What if I promised you
that if you let me in...

32:30.785 --> 32:33.870
all I'm expecting is a cup of coffee?
That's it.

32:34.287 --> 32:36.205
Nothing weird or funny.

32:37.624 --> 32:41.877
Unless you're into weird and funny,
'cause I could do weird and funny.

32:43.462 --> 32:45.797
I've been enjoying
the hell out of myself tonight...

32:45.880 --> 32:48.216
- and I think you are, too.
- I am.

32:48.424 --> 32:50.634
So, it's snowing...

32:51.761 --> 32:54.846
- cold, and your daughter is elsewhere.
- I know.

32:56.722 --> 32:59.725
The whole night's been
a weird kismet of events.

32:59.809 --> 33:02.561
- It's that fate guy again.
- At some point in your life...

33:02.644 --> 33:06.898
you have to decide that some guy
is worth opening that front door for.

33:07.148 --> 33:09.066
I am just volunteering.

33:17.615 --> 33:19.700
Would you like some coffee?

33:25.121 --> 33:29.041
How strong do you like your coffee?
'Cause I've built up such a tolerance to it...

33:29.084 --> 33:31.002
I make it too intense for most people.

33:31.085 --> 33:33.879
I lived through the fiesta burger.
Don't hold back now.

33:35.755 --> 33:39.092
- Can I help?
- Yeah, you can fill up the pot.

33:39.175 --> 33:41.051
I'm very good at that.

33:43.095 --> 33:45.931
- Six cups sounds good?
- Fine.

33:46.681 --> 33:48.641
What are you gonna have?

33:49.475 --> 33:51.727
You do know
that was a leading question, right?

33:51.810 --> 33:53.354
Really? How so?

33:58.316 --> 34:00.443
- How badly do you want that coffee?
- Not badly.

34:00.526 --> 34:02.236
Such a good answer.

34:31.469 --> 34:33.304
How many kids did you say you have?

34:33.387 --> 34:34.971
One. Why?

34:35.054 --> 34:36.639
Lane! Hi!

34:38.266 --> 34:42.061
- We're just... What are you doing here?
- I'm sorry. I was waiting for Rory.

34:42.143 --> 34:45.772
I'll just go back into her room,
and I won't come back out. I promise.

34:52.152 --> 34:55.447
That's The Cure. I have to go back in there.

34:55.656 --> 34:57.991
It's okay, I'll finish up the coffee.

34:58.074 --> 35:01.243
- I'll be back as fast as humanly possible.
- Good.

35:10.835 --> 35:12.544
I'm sorry I messed up your date.

35:12.628 --> 35:15.296
You didn't mess up my date.
What's going on?

35:15.547 --> 35:20.134
- I was waiting for Rory to get home.
- Sweetie, Rory's stuck in Hartford tonight.

35:21.051 --> 35:23.762
I didn't know. I'll just go.

35:24.388 --> 35:26.139
Do you want to talk?

35:26.848 --> 35:29.684
I'm not Rory,
but we do use the same blow dryer.

35:29.768 --> 35:32.644
I did something really stupid today.

35:33.187 --> 35:35.939
- Okay, what did you pierce?
- Nothing.

35:37.232 --> 35:40.276
- I touched a boy's hair.
- Okay.

35:40.526 --> 35:44.363
- A boy I really like.
- So far I'm missing the stupid part.

35:44.696 --> 35:48.324
- I kind of did it without his permission.
- Now we're getting somewhere.

35:48.366 --> 35:51.744
I don't know what happened.
I was just standing there.

35:51.827 --> 35:54.747
And then he bends over,
and his hair falls forward...

35:54.830 --> 35:57.248
and suddenly it's like
my hand has a life of its own.

35:57.331 --> 35:59.584
Sounds like your hand had help
from your hormones.

35:59.667 --> 36:02.670
God, I'm so humiliated.
I can't ever go back to school.

36:02.753 --> 36:06.131
I'll have to be home-schooled.
My mother finally gets her way.

36:06.214 --> 36:08.049
Look at it from a different perspective.

36:08.132 --> 36:10.676
You have so many years of screw-ups
ahead of you.

36:10.759 --> 36:14.304
View this as a trial run
for really grown-up humiliation.

36:14.387 --> 36:15.722
So not helping.

36:15.806 --> 36:18.266
Maybe you should be a hairdresser.

36:18.891 --> 36:21.936
It's perfect. You can run your hands
through anybody's hair...

36:22.019 --> 36:25.022
- and they'll pay you for it.
- What am I going to do?

36:25.105 --> 36:28.357
Everyone at school's gonna be talking
about me. I can't show my face.

36:28.441 --> 36:30.484
Everybody does stupid things
in high school.

36:30.568 --> 36:32.445
- It's a requirement.
- Not like this.

36:32.528 --> 36:34.697
No, some people get pregnant.

36:35.572 --> 36:38.574
Talk about something really juicy
for the gossip mill.

36:38.658 --> 36:40.117
I forgot about that.

36:41.160 --> 36:44.163
Everybody screws up, Lane.
That's what happens.

36:44.246 --> 36:45.914
It's what you do with the screw-ups...

36:45.997 --> 36:50.084
how you handle the experience...
That's what you should judge yourself by.

36:50.293 --> 36:53.295
I have a great life and an amazing kid.

36:53.754 --> 36:56.048
And I took a detour.

36:57.090 --> 36:59.133
I ended up someplace good.

37:00.635 --> 37:02.095
Tell me this.

37:02.178 --> 37:04.930
How did his hair feel? Good as it looked?

37:05.097 --> 37:06.306
Better.

37:06.764 --> 37:09.767
You're gonna be fine.
I'm positive about that.

37:10.893 --> 37:12.978
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

37:13.562 --> 37:15.022
So who's the guy?

37:16.273 --> 37:17.816
Rory's teacher.

37:18.942 --> 37:20.568
He has nice hair.

37:33.287 --> 37:36.414
- Everything okay in there?
- It will be.

37:37.415 --> 37:39.500
So, where did we leave off?

37:40.460 --> 37:42.795
Lane is gonna stay here tonight.

37:44.004 --> 37:45.714
She had a really bad teen day...

37:45.797 --> 37:48.508
and she needs to crash
someplace sympathetic.

37:48.675 --> 37:50.384
Okay, I understand.

37:50.468 --> 37:53.470
I swear to God, if this wasn't
a major Judy Blume moment...

37:53.553 --> 37:56.640
I would kick her cute little butt
right out of here.

37:56.724 --> 38:00.477
Can you recommend a hotel
that's really close to here?

38:00.810 --> 38:04.397
Why don't you just stay here tonight?
Everybody else is.

38:04.480 --> 38:07.440
- I don't know.
- Really, the couch is comfortable.

38:07.524 --> 38:11.778
And there's pillows and blankets.
The bathroom's through there.

38:11.944 --> 38:14.405
And the kitchen has nothing in it...

38:14.488 --> 38:17.074
but running water if you get thirsty.

38:18.158 --> 38:19.951
And it's an awful night.

38:20.034 --> 38:22.829
- Okay, if it's not a problem.
- Not at all.

38:24.579 --> 38:27.457
Could I at least give you a kiss good-night?

38:27.624 --> 38:30.334
Only if you intend to live till morning.

38:39.968 --> 38:41.302
Good night.

39:26.840 --> 39:28.716
- What's up?
- Nothing. What's up with you?

39:28.800 --> 39:30.051
You have something to tell me.

39:30.135 --> 39:32.512
Boy, you're so smart.
Right. Okay. Here we go.

39:32.553 --> 39:34.763
I've got a boy in the house.

39:34.847 --> 39:37.015
- You what?
- Nothing happened, I swear.

39:37.057 --> 39:40.226
- He slept on the couch. And you know him.
- I do?

39:40.352 --> 39:42.478
You like him.
I don't know if that's relevant.

39:42.561 --> 39:45.648
I just thought
that I would throw that in there.

39:47.398 --> 39:49.359
- It's Mr. Medina.
- I know.

39:49.526 --> 39:52.195
My English teacher is on my couch.

39:53.237 --> 39:57.199
It was the snow.
You know how I get. It's like catnip.

39:57.991 --> 40:02.328
I was walking. He was there.
His car was broken. We had fiesta burgers.

40:02.870 --> 40:04.705
It was the snow.

40:06.248 --> 40:08.416
Rory, say something.

40:13.504 --> 40:14.963
Rory, talk to me.

40:15.047 --> 40:17.299
- How do you feel?
- I don't know.

40:17.383 --> 40:19.717
Take a guess: Angry, frustrated, nauseous?

40:19.760 --> 40:21.552
Weird. I feel weird.

40:21.928 --> 40:24.138
- Has he been here all night?
- Pretty much.

40:24.222 --> 40:25.973
Oh, my God! Did he go into the bathroom?

40:26.057 --> 40:28.225
I have stuff hanging in there!

40:28.308 --> 40:31.185
You knew I was gonna date him.
This isn't a total surprise.

40:31.269 --> 40:35.189
Yes, I knew you were gonna date.
I just didn't expect for him to be here...

40:35.273 --> 40:37.900
- at our house in the morning.
- I know.

40:37.983 --> 40:40.902
I don't even remember ever
there being a man in our house.

40:40.943 --> 40:43.571
Yeah, well, I kind of broke the rules.

40:44.071 --> 40:46.448
God, why is this so weird for me?

40:46.615 --> 40:49.034
Because I should have told you first.

40:49.117 --> 40:50.118
No.

40:50.201 --> 40:52.870
Because I should have talked to you
before I did this.

40:53.163 --> 40:56.624
Because you're afraid he smooshed
the couch pillows out of shape?

40:56.665 --> 40:58.083
Do you love him?

40:59.710 --> 41:02.712
We had one date. It was a great date.

41:03.212 --> 41:06.465
World Series level. But it was just a date.

41:09.425 --> 41:12.887
Honey, I promised myself
a long time ago...

41:12.970 --> 41:15.556
that I was gonna keep all this stuff
separate from you.

41:15.639 --> 41:18.850
And I want you to know that,
that still stands, okay?

41:18.934 --> 41:20.935
This was a one-time thing.

41:21.019 --> 41:23.146
I'm not gonna start
just bringing guys home.

41:23.229 --> 41:24.981
This is not a trend.

41:25.606 --> 41:27.482
- You can, you know.
- What?

41:27.565 --> 41:28.942
Bring guys home.

41:28.984 --> 41:32.112
If you like someone,
you should feel comfortable doing that.

41:32.153 --> 41:35.072
- I appreciate that.
- I want you to be happy.

41:35.281 --> 41:36.657
And I love you for that.

41:36.740 --> 41:38.575
Plus, I know you're not a cat person...

41:38.659 --> 41:40.744
so you will be alone
if you don't find someone.

41:40.827 --> 41:44.621
Okay, look,
someday I will bring somebody home.

41:45.289 --> 41:48.709
But when I do,
I just want to be sure it's the guy.

41:49.626 --> 41:52.629
- Mr. Medina's not the guy?
- I don't know.

41:53.171 --> 41:54.505
He might be.

41:54.838 --> 41:57.341
But right now, it's just you and me.

41:57.591 --> 41:59.300
And sometimes Lane.

42:05.055 --> 42:07.265
I'm gonna go wake the man up.

42:10.018 --> 42:11.853
Your mom let me spend the night here.

42:11.936 --> 42:15.355
I tried calling you all night,
but the phones didn't work until morning.

42:15.440 --> 42:18.400
- That's okay. I understand.
- Lane, I'm so sorry.

42:18.483 --> 42:20.026
I've been the worst friend lately.

42:20.109 --> 42:22.570
No, I just wigged out a little.

42:23.613 --> 42:25.114
I get jealous sometimes.

42:25.198 --> 42:28.659
I mean, you seem to have
this really great life going...

42:28.742 --> 42:30.452
and I don't really fit in there.

42:30.535 --> 42:33.287
That's not true. You totally fit in.

42:34.329 --> 42:36.999
- Yeah?
- I'm talking Legos.

42:37.707 --> 42:39.083
I hope so.

42:39.167 --> 42:41.836
I will be better from now on, I promise.

42:42.211 --> 42:45.673
- Twenty-four hours a day, at your disposal.
- Dean will love that.

42:45.715 --> 42:48.342
Well, he'll have to. You came first.

42:48.717 --> 42:51.386
That's right. I got dibs.

42:54.889 --> 42:57.516
Okay. I have to go home.

42:59.768 --> 43:02.103
- Coffee at Luke's, 2:00?
- You're on.

43:02.186 --> 43:04.438
I wanna hear all about
that hair-touching incident.

43:04.522 --> 43:08.317
Yeah. And I wanna hear the rest
of the teacher-on-the-couch incident.

43:08.400 --> 43:09.484
Deal.
