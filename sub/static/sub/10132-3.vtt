08:04.651 --> 08:07.862
for dessert.

08:07.904 --> 08:09.823
Thanks, Nick,

08:07.904 --> 08:09.823
but I gotta run.

08:11.574 --> 08:13.201
Well, Jesse should

08:11.574 --> 08:13.201
be back any minute.

08:13.243 --> 08:15.536
I've gotta get down to the

08:13.243 --> 08:15.536
station and tape some promos.

08:15.578 --> 08:16.704
- 'Bye, Michelle.'

08:15.578 --> 08:16.704
- 'Bye.'

08:16.746 --> 08:19.833
Michelle, I got your nose.

08:21.542 --> 08:24.963
Where's your nose?

08:21.542 --> 08:24.963
Where is it?

08:25.005 --> 08:27.507
There it is.

08:27.548 --> 08:29.801
You wanna ride the horse?

08:27.548 --> 08:29.801
Come on.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.762
Let's go ride the horse.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.762
There you go.

08:34.139 --> 08:36.057
[Nick groans]

08:36.099 --> 08:39.894
Irene, I have a terrific idea.

08:36.099 --> 08:39.894
Let's have another baby.

08:39.936 --> 08:42.356
Sweetie, if your brain

08:39.936 --> 08:42.356
was a pasture

08:42.397 --> 08:44.399
the sheep would starve.

08:44.441 --> 08:47.277
I read in the National Intruder

08:44.441 --> 08:47.277
that a 95-year-old

08:47.319 --> 08:49.529
great grandmother

08:47.319 --> 08:49.529
gave birth to twins.

08:49.570 --> 08:52.699
She had a 19-year-old boyfriend.

08:52.740 --> 08:55.452
What are you saying?

08:55.494 --> 08:58.205
What are you saying?

08:58.246 --> 09:01.708
Are you saying

08:58.246 --> 09:01.708
I'm running outta gas?

09:01.749 --> 09:03.710
What about last night?

09:03.751 --> 09:05.462
Was I outta gas then?

09:05.504 --> 09:07.881
You're a Texaco station, okay?

09:07.922 --> 09:09.549
[chuckles]

09:09.590 --> 09:11.051
Have mercy.

09:16.431 --> 09:17.598
Kids in the room.

09:17.640 --> 09:20.394
- Kids in the room.

09:17.640 --> 09:20.394
- Hi, kids.

09:20.435 --> 09:22.603
Uncle Jesse's back.

09:20.435 --> 09:22.603
He's got big news.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.689
- It's about time.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.689
- Okay.

09:24.731 --> 09:25.899
Joey!

09:25.940 --> 09:27.692
Come here, girls.

09:25.940 --> 09:27.692
Girls, come here.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.528
Here's five bucks

09:27.734 --> 09:29.528
for each of you.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.113
- Thanks, Grandma.

09:32.155 --> 09:35.534
Now, remember our deal.

09:32.155 --> 09:35.534
Don't you dare tell Grandpa.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.160
- Got it.

09:39.496 --> 09:41.415
Me money.

09:43.708 --> 09:44.876
I let you off work

09:43.708 --> 09:44.876
this afternoon

09:44.918 --> 09:46.127
for your little music hobby

09:46.169 --> 09:47.546
but tomorrow I gonna

09:46.169 --> 09:47.546
need you real early.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.839
- Okay, dad, I got great news.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.839
- So do I.

09:49.881 --> 09:52.592
Fraser Street is crawling

09:49.881 --> 09:52.592
with cockroaches.

09:52.633 --> 09:55.554
It's an exterminator's dream.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.138
So, what's the big news?

09:57.180 --> 09:58.848
They bought it!

09:57.180 --> 09:58.848
I sold my first jingle.

09:58.890 --> 10:00.683
- Alright!

09:58.890 --> 10:00.683
- Yeah!

10:04.521 --> 10:07.023
Tss. Oh, the man is hot.

10:07.065 --> 10:08.442
[chuckles]

10:08.483 --> 10:10.818
- Pretty good, huh, pop?

10:08.483 --> 10:10.818
- Good going.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.153
Now, back to the real world.

10:12.195 --> 10:13.696
Cockroaches.

10:13.738 --> 10:16.324
Pick you up at 5 a.m.

10:13.738 --> 10:16.324
We attack at dawn.

10:19.494 --> 10:22.038
Ah. Finally, he puts up Sinatra.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.040
There is a God.

10:24.082 --> 10:25.917
I'm doing

10:24.082 --> 10:25.917
a little redecorating.

10:25.959 --> 10:26.960
You didn't call me up here to

10:27.001 --> 10:29.003
talk about redecorating,

10:27.001 --> 10:29.003
did you?

10:29.045 --> 10:30.547
How did you know that?

10:30.589 --> 10:32.715
Jesse, I gave birth to you.

10:32.757 --> 10:34.134
I powdered your little tushy.

10:34.175 --> 10:37.762
Stop with the tushy, mom.

10:34.175 --> 10:37.762
Come on. Sit down.

10:39.639 --> 10:43.351
Ma, I wanna talk to you

10:39.639 --> 10:43.351
about my life and my music

10:43.393 --> 10:44.727
and I hope you'll understand.

10:44.769 --> 10:47.730
Oh, sure, I'll understand.

10:44.769 --> 10:47.730
Hey, it's me.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.149
I'm hip, I'm with it. I'm bad.

10:49.190 --> 10:51.359
Who's bad?

10:49.190 --> 10:51.359
I'm bad, you know it.

10:53.027 --> 10:55.155
So, tell me

10:53.027 --> 10:55.155
what you have to tell.

10:55.196 --> 10:57.698
Okay, well, you know, I've

10:55.196 --> 10:57.698
been working as an exterminator

10:57.740 --> 11:00.535
to earn a living

10:57.740 --> 11:00.535
until my band made it, right?

11:00.577 --> 11:02.621
Well, selling this jingle

11:00.577 --> 11:02.621
made me realize that

11:02.662 --> 11:06.040
I can earn a living

11:02.662 --> 11:06.040
playing music right now.

11:06.082 --> 11:10.086
The bottom line is...I don't

11:06.082 --> 11:10.086
wanna work with pop anymore.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.381
[sighs]

11:13.423 --> 11:15.383
I knew, this day was coming.

11:15.425 --> 11:18.595
I was hoping, I'd be dead

11:15.425 --> 11:18.595
when it did.

11:18.637 --> 11:20.138
He's gonna flip out, isn't he?

11:20.180 --> 11:22.223
You know, he's always dreamed

11:20.180 --> 11:22.223
that you'd take over

11:22.265 --> 11:25.768
the business and follow

11:22.265 --> 11:25.768
in his footsteps.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.187
But you..

11:27.228 --> 11:29.147
'You gotta follow

11:27.228 --> 11:29.147
your own dreams.'

11:29.189 --> 11:32.108
So, you tell him

11:32.150 --> 11:35.654
but when you do it,

11:32.150 --> 11:35.654
do it with love, okay?

11:35.694 --> 11:37.197
Love. Thanks, ma.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.370
Uh, Francis Albert.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.370
When he sings..

11:43.411 --> 11:44.787
...you understand the words.

11:44.829 --> 11:47.207
Yeah, well, you turned me

11:44.829 --> 11:47.207
on to Frank, pop.

11:47.248 --> 11:49.750
- You know your music.

11:47.248 --> 11:49.750
- Greeks invented music.

11:49.792 --> 11:52.879
And Italians perfected it.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.964
Sit down a second, Pop.

11:56.466 --> 11:58.176
I'm making a lot of changes

11:56.466 --> 11:58.176
in my life.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.760
You know, I cut my hair

11:59.802 --> 12:03.223
I'm dressing nicer,

11:59.802 --> 12:03.223
I'm growing up.

12:03.264 --> 12:04.683
And I think it's time

12:03.264 --> 12:04.683
that I made

12:04.723 --> 12:06.518
a real commitment to my career.

12:06.560 --> 12:07.894
Really?

12:07.935 --> 12:10.522
You're finally ready

12:07.935 --> 12:10.522
to be a partner.

12:10.564 --> 12:14.942
This is great!

12:10.564 --> 12:14.942
This is beautiful!

12:14.984 --> 12:18.446
You know, son, 27 years ago

12:18.488 --> 12:22.659
I started out with nothing

12:18.488 --> 12:22.659
but a fly swatter and a dream.

12:23.993 --> 12:27.163
Today...

12:23.993 --> 12:27.163
over one billion squashed.

12:30.166 --> 12:31.959
Uh, Nick, you're not listening.

12:32.001 --> 12:34.087
He's trying

12:32.001 --> 12:34.087
to tell you something.

12:34.128 --> 12:37.840
Irene, when it comes to my son

12:34.128 --> 12:37.840
I don't need your help.

12:37.882 --> 12:41.386
Oh, really? I suppose when he

12:37.882 --> 12:41.386
was born you went into labor.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.638
What do you think carrying you

12:41.428 --> 12:43.638
out to the car wasn't labor?

12:43.680 --> 12:45.515
- Pop.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.515
- Starting with weight again.

12:45.557 --> 12:46.891
That was love weight, Nick.

12:46.933 --> 12:50.562
Come on. Please, please.

12:46.933 --> 12:50.562
Parents, come on, now.

12:50.604 --> 12:54.023
Pop, I found a way to make money

12:50.604 --> 12:54.023
doing something I love, music.

12:54.065 --> 12:56.775
What you gonna make a living

12:54.065 --> 12:56.775
with this, Mr. Musician?

12:56.817 --> 12:59.946
How many records

12:56.817 --> 12:59.946
have you sold?

12:59.987 --> 13:01.155
Well, none.

13:01.197 --> 13:03.450
How many bugs

13:01.197 --> 13:03.450
have you killed?

13:03.491 --> 13:06.536
- Millions.

13:03.491 --> 13:06.536
- Uh, stick with a winner.

13:06.578 --> 13:09.830
Pop, I can't do something just

13:06.578 --> 13:09.830
because you want me to do it.

13:09.872 --> 13:11.583
We're two totally

13:09.872 --> 13:11.583
different people.

13:11.625 --> 13:13.126
- We're the same.

13:11.625 --> 13:13.126
- We're different.

13:13.167 --> 13:15.169
- We're the same!

13:13.167 --> 13:15.169
- We're different!

13:15.211 --> 13:17.004
- Will you listen to me?

13:17.046 --> 13:18.632
- Oh.

13:21.092 --> 13:23.386
I've made up my mind, pop.

13:23.428 --> 13:24.721
Meaning what?

13:24.763 --> 13:28.266
Meaning...I quit.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.685
You can't quit.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.685
I built this business for you.

13:30.727 --> 13:32.186
Daddy, it's not what I wanna do.

13:32.228 --> 13:33.730
- Then quit.

13:32.228 --> 13:33.730
- Okay, I quit.

13:33.772 --> 13:36.983
Fine, if you're out

13:33.772 --> 13:36.983
of the family business..

13:37.024 --> 13:38.693
...you're out of the family.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.737
- Pop.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.737
- Nick.

13:40.779 --> 13:43.864
[instrumental music]

13:50.705 --> 13:54.959
"Goodnight clocks

13:50.705 --> 13:54.959
and goodnight.."

13:55.001 --> 13:56.294
Sock.

13:58.212 --> 14:01.840
"Goodnight little house

13:58.212 --> 14:01.840
and goodnight.."

14:01.882 --> 14:02.967
Mouse.

14:03.009 --> 14:05.219
Mouse.

14:05.261 --> 14:08.097
Hey, Jess. Wanna help me

14:05.261 --> 14:08.097
put Michelle to bed?

14:08.139 --> 14:10.933
No. I just wanna watch

14:08.139 --> 14:10.933
a great dad in action.

14:12.769 --> 14:16.773
You listen to her, you try

14:12.769 --> 14:16.773
to understand her problems.

14:16.815 --> 14:22.153
You accept her for who she is,

14:16.815 --> 14:22.153
her goals, her values.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.030
She's a two-year-old.

14:24.071 --> 14:26.866
Her goal is to eat with a fork.

14:26.907 --> 14:28.785
Still, you respect that.

14:32.038 --> 14:35.291
Michelle, let's cut the story

14:32.038 --> 14:35.291
short tonight

14:35.333 --> 14:39.754
because I think Uncle Jesse

14:35.333 --> 14:39.754
needs me more than you do.

14:39.796 --> 14:41.047
Okay.

14:43.216 --> 14:44.551
Goodnight, little mouse.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.302
Goodnight, Daddy.

14:52.767 --> 14:54.644
Did you try calling your dad?

14:54.686 --> 14:57.230
What's the point? He kicked me

14:54.686 --> 14:57.230
out of the family.

14:57.271 --> 14:59.482
The point is you're sitting

14:57.271 --> 14:59.482
on the floor in the hallway

14:59.524 --> 15:01.275
like a potted plant.

15:01.317 --> 15:03.611
Jesse, let's talk

15:01.317 --> 15:03.611
about it. Get up.

15:03.653 --> 15:04.945
Come with me.

15:08.157 --> 15:10.451
Look at this room, it's a mess.

15:10.493 --> 15:13.454
Sorry, just slipped out.

15:13.496 --> 15:16.332
Look, Jess, I know Nick.

15:16.374 --> 15:17.584
He didn't mean it.

15:17.625 --> 15:20.628
He's just a hot-headed

15:17.625 --> 15:20.628
stubborn guy.

15:20.670 --> 15:25.717
But underneath all that

15:20.670 --> 15:25.717
anger...is more anger.

15:25.759 --> 15:29.888
But underneath that is a man

15:25.759 --> 15:29.888
who's really hurting

15:29.929 --> 15:31.639
because he really loves you.

15:33.307 --> 15:35.643
Well, he's gotta stop trying

15:33.307 --> 15:35.643
to run my life.

15:35.685 --> 15:37.144
I'm 25 years old.

15:37.186 --> 15:38.605
He's gotta start accepting me

15:37.186 --> 15:38.605
as an adult

15:38.646 --> 15:40.231
who can make his own decisions.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.315
It's my life, man.

15:41.357 --> 15:42.358
I'm gonna do whatever it takes

15:42.400 --> 15:43.484
to make me happy.

15:43.526 --> 15:45.027
Good. Are you happy?

15:45.069 --> 15:47.572
No, I'm miserable.

15:47.614 --> 15:52.243
Jesse, you're not gonna be happy

15:47.614 --> 15:52.243
until you do everything you can

15:52.285 --> 15:54.829
to make things right

15:52.285 --> 15:54.829
with your father.

15:54.871 --> 15:56.497
You've gotta

15:54.871 --> 15:56.497
reach out to him.

15:58.332 --> 16:00.668
Come on. Sleep on it, okay?

16:00.710 --> 16:02.295

Goodnight, little mouse.

16:08.593 --> 16:09.719
Goodnight.

16:17.143 --> 16:18.603
What am I doing? It's 7 o'clock.

16:24.609 --> 16:26.444
No dentist.

16:26.486 --> 16:29.697
I'm not going.

16:29.739 --> 16:33.493
I'm not going.

16:33.534 --> 16:35.328
May I help you?

16:37.747 --> 16:39.206
Where am I?

16:39.248 --> 16:42.877
In my bed. What are you

16:39.248 --> 16:42.877
doing in here?

16:42.919 --> 16:44.963
I don't know.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.465
I had a bad dream.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.968
I was running in a forest

16:50.009 --> 16:53.429
and all the trees

16:50.009 --> 16:53.429
were dentists.

16:53.471 --> 16:55.306
And they were chasing me yelling

16:55.348 --> 16:58.685
"Open wide, open wide."

16:59.477 --> 17:01.437
It was just a dream.

17:01.479 --> 17:04.524
How do I know you're not a dream

17:01.479 --> 17:04.524
telling me it's just a dream?

17:04.565 --> 17:07.694
- Ow!

17:04.565 --> 17:07.694
- I'm awake.

17:07.735 --> 17:08.987
You're supposed

17:07.735 --> 17:08.987
to pinch yourself

17:09.028 --> 17:12.031
you little nerd bomber.

17:12.072 --> 17:14.241
I'm sorry,

17:12.072 --> 17:14.241
but I'm not myself.

17:14.283 --> 17:18.120
D.J., I'm really afraid

17:14.283 --> 17:18.120
of the dentist.

17:18.162 --> 17:21.290
That's because

17:18.162 --> 17:21.290
you're a little kid.

17:21.332 --> 17:23.877
A long time ago,

17:21.332 --> 17:23.877
back when I was a little kid

17:23.918 --> 17:27.046
I was afraid of getting sucked

17:23.918 --> 17:27.046
down the drain in the bathtub.

17:27.087 --> 17:29.215
- Really?

17:27.087 --> 17:29.215
- Yeah.

17:29.256 --> 17:30.675
So, when you were a year old

17:30.717 --> 17:32.760
I put you in the tub

17:30.717 --> 17:32.760
and pulled the plug.

17:32.802 --> 17:36.890
And when you didn't go anywhere

17:32.802 --> 17:36.890
I knew it was safe.

17:36.931 --> 17:40.643
You tried to send me

17:36.931 --> 17:40.643

Hey, you were only a year old.
