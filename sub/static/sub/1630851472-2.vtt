01:32.480 --> 01:33.800
Oh, my God!

01:35.640 --> 01:38.560
Bobbin! Come here! Yes!

01:38.640 --> 01:40.000
I'm... I'm Wendy.

01:40.080 --> 01:41.840
I live in the cottage
at the end of...

01:41.920 --> 01:43.000
I don't understand.

01:43.080 --> 01:44.280
They said he'd died.

01:45.240 --> 01:47.360
Baby, they said you'd died.

01:47.440 --> 01:49.320
I know,
and I didn't think that was right.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.480
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, why would they do that?

01:51.560 --> 01:55.120
I probably shouldn't have come,
but he was so unhappy.

01:55.200 --> 01:59.160
I missed you too.
Oh, baby, I missed you so much.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.920
Jo, come away from the door.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.040
Wendy, you know
you're not supposed to be here.

02:07.240 --> 02:08.240
That's not Bobbin.

02:09.600 --> 02:10.680
Of course it's Bobbin.

02:12.160 --> 02:13.400
I know my dog.

02:13.480 --> 02:14.960
Come away from the door.

02:17.640 --> 02:18.840
Oh, no!

02:19.680 --> 02:20.760
No!

02:21.480 --> 02:24.960
- Oh, my God!
- His insides are coming out!

02:25.600 --> 02:28.720
Oh, my God!
Push them back in! Push them in!

02:28.800 --> 02:30.400
Help me!

02:30.480 --> 02:31.280
Jo?

02:35.000 --> 02:35.800
Jo?

02:38.800 --> 02:39.600
Are you okay?

02:49.960 --> 02:50.920
Bobbin is dead...

02:52.160 --> 02:52.960
isn't he?

02:53.880 --> 02:54.680
Yeah.

02:56.000 --> 02:56.800
He is.

02:57.520 --> 02:58.520
Did you kill him?

03:01.360 --> 03:02.160
What?

03:03.000 --> 03:03.800
No!

03:04.720 --> 03:06.400
Why would you say
something like that?

03:07.720 --> 03:08.680
I'm so sorry.

03:11.920 --> 03:12.880
Sorry.

03:17.920 --> 03:18.880
Thank you.

03:24.360 --> 03:25.920
- I really am sorry.
- That's okay.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.200
I've been having
these awful nightmares

03:29.280 --> 03:31.200
and it's hard
to make sense of things.

03:31.280 --> 03:33.400
Well... just drink your tea

03:33.480 --> 03:37.080
and take your time
and we'll start the day again.

03:50.480 --> 03:53.440
I wanna go to that support group
the doctor talked about.

03:53.520 --> 03:55.560
Really? Is it not too soon?

03:55.640 --> 03:59.400
<i>Amnesia,
the gift that keeps on giving.</i>

04:00.120 --> 04:01.040
It's been a week.

04:03.880 --> 04:06.680
I've been locked up in here
and I'm slowly going demented.

04:06.760 --> 04:08.880
Okay. You normally hate
that kind of thing.

04:08.960 --> 04:10.280
What kind of thing?

04:10.360 --> 04:13.400
Groups, strangers,

04:13.480 --> 04:16.200
having to wait for the sharing stick
before you speak.

04:17.200 --> 04:20.120
Well, I need to talk
to someone who's trained.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.320
Nothing's coming back to me.

04:22.400 --> 04:24.640
Okay, well, we'll do
whatever you need to do.

04:25.560 --> 04:28.520
Great. It's at 11:00. I'll get ready.

04:28.600 --> 04:29.680
Oh, you mean today?

05:38.800 --> 05:39.600
Nick.

05:53.480 --> 05:55.360
I love you! I miss you already!

06:03.000 --> 06:03.800
Fuck!

06:21.920 --> 06:22.800
Ready to rumble?

06:23.840 --> 06:24.640
Yeah.

06:43.280 --> 06:44.720
Why are we going this way?

06:47.200 --> 06:48.680
We've never been this way.

06:48.760 --> 06:50.440
There's road works. It's quicker.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.200
It's a weird road.

06:54.440 --> 06:57.960
Listen, I, uh, might have
to pop out tomorrow.

06:58.760 --> 07:01.040
Won't be for long. Is that all right?

07:04.720 --> 07:06.720
Jo? Is that okay?

07:07.480 --> 07:08.280
What?

07:08.840 --> 07:11.120
It's just some work stuff.
I won't be long.

07:11.200 --> 07:12.000
Okay.

07:16.680 --> 07:17.480
Mum.

07:18.320 --> 07:19.720
I really wanna see Finn.

07:25.160 --> 07:25.960
What?

07:26.480 --> 07:29.400
He's got a little bit trickier
this last 12 months.

07:30.360 --> 07:32.160
- I don't think it's drugs...
- Drugs?

07:32.240 --> 07:34.360
It's probably just puberty
finally kicking in.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.040
He's 18, Rob.

07:37.120 --> 07:39.280
He's, uh, 19 actually.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.440
God, I'm such a shit show.

07:43.120 --> 07:43.960
Hey, Jo.

07:44.800 --> 07:47.240
I can't remember
what's gone in the last 12 months.

07:47.920 --> 07:50.680
It doesn't really matter.
We need to live in the now.

07:50.760 --> 07:52.880
What are you, a man or a meme?

07:57.720 --> 07:58.600
Jo?

08:01.880 --> 08:02.840
Jo?

08:02.920 --> 08:04.800
- Rob, do you see that woman?
- Jo?

08:05.560 --> 08:06.800
- What?
- Who's that woman?

08:06.880 --> 08:09.080
- She knows me.
- What woman?

08:11.840 --> 08:12.720
What woman, Jo?

08:15.240 --> 08:16.360
No, nothing.

08:32.960 --> 08:34.640
Well, at least let me carry you in.

08:35.400 --> 08:39.600
It's literally right there, Rob.
I need to build my confidence.

08:39.680 --> 08:43.080
I'll wait here in case you hate it.
If you fall over, I'll pick you up.

08:43.920 --> 08:44.920
Fuck off.

08:55.840 --> 08:57.160
Nice stick, missus.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.320
Oh, miss, you got the time?

09:18.400 --> 09:19.760
- Give me your phone.
- What?

09:19.840 --> 09:21.600
Give me your phone and money.

09:22.880 --> 09:24.400
Give me your phone and purse now!

09:25.520 --> 09:27.680
Fuck off! You give me
your money and your phone!

09:27.760 --> 09:29.680
Please,
don't fucking piss me off, man!

09:38.760 --> 09:42.400
Shit! Go get a job, you arsehole!

09:43.400 --> 09:45.160
You know what really pisses me off?

09:45.240 --> 09:47.160
You just made me
sound like my mother!

09:49.960 --> 09:51.800
I hope
somebody's chalked you up one.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.400
Crazy bitch!

10:04.040 --> 10:04.840
Shit!

10:16.120 --> 10:18.080
<i>Maybe you were safer in the alley.</i>

10:24.800 --> 10:26.240
- Hiya.
- Hi.

10:26.320 --> 10:27.120
You're new.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.640
I'm Sharon. Pleased to meet ya.

10:29.720 --> 10:31.200
Hi, Sharon.

10:31.280 --> 10:33.160
I used to be
the manager of a coffee shop,

10:33.240 --> 10:35.880
but, uh, I can't even tie
my own shoelaces these days.

10:37.040 --> 10:39.920
Still, I was getting fed up
with the daily grind anyway.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.400
Daily grind... yeah?

10:46.000 --> 10:46.800
I'm Jo.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.640
Who in the name of Jesus
chooses these biscuits?

10:49.720 --> 10:50.800
And squash?

10:52.200 --> 10:54.200
What next, stickers for being brave?

10:56.320 --> 10:57.680
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:57.760 --> 11:01.040
I'm Helen. Welcome to the madhouse.

11:01.120 --> 11:02.080
Jo.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.120
Are you okay?

11:08.320 --> 11:12.600
I caught your altercation outside
and I was gonna come out,

11:12.680 --> 11:15.320
but I wouldn't be surprised
if we saw him here next week.

11:16.120 --> 11:20.600
It's an unusual
but interesting form of recruitment.

11:22.440 --> 11:24.360
I don't know what I...

11:26.320 --> 11:28.320
I should probably go
and check on him.

11:28.400 --> 11:29.200
Why?

11:31.640 --> 11:32.800
Okay, shall we start?

11:33.880 --> 11:37.280
Come on, let's go and talk
about our thoughts and feelings.

11:37.840 --> 11:38.640
Yay!

11:41.920 --> 11:43.240
Thanks, Olivia.

11:43.320 --> 11:44.520
You're coping brilliantly

11:44.600 --> 11:47.600
with a really complex
mother-daughter relationship.

11:48.360 --> 11:49.200
Just keep going.

11:53.560 --> 11:55.480
I don't feel
like sharing today, Michelle,

11:55.560 --> 11:56.600
before you ask.

11:58.280 --> 11:59.840
I've had a terrible week.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.000
That's fine, Jerry.

12:01.080 --> 12:03.080
We're here for you whenever you want.

12:07.440 --> 12:09.440
Uh, I'd like to.

12:11.200 --> 12:13.320
Please? If that's okay.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.200
Of course.

12:14.920 --> 12:16.640
Um, I'm Jo.

12:18.680 --> 12:19.480
I...

12:21.400 --> 12:22.280
wrote it down.

12:22.360 --> 12:23.600
I need reminding.

12:24.640 --> 12:27.040
I fell down the stairs and I'm...

12:27.800 --> 12:30.440
I landed on my head as you can see.

12:31.280 --> 12:33.240
So I have...

12:34.240 --> 12:35.320
amnesia...

12:36.560 --> 12:37.640
disinhibition...

12:38.880 --> 12:40.000
So they tell me.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.080
So you fell down the stairs?

12:43.120 --> 12:43.920
Yes.

12:47.800 --> 12:53.640
And I have...
paranoia and hallucinations.

12:55.840 --> 12:58.400
Basically, it's like I'm...

12:59.440 --> 13:02.840
I'm a stranger
in... inside my own head.

13:03.640 --> 13:05.560
A stranger inside your own head.

13:07.080 --> 13:08.840
Is there an echo in here?

13:08.920 --> 13:11.000
It's quite, uh, a common feeling.

13:12.880 --> 13:18.200
Well, I feel like I'm being left
to piece together

13:18.280 --> 13:21.560
whatever the hell is wrong with me
on my own.

13:21.640 --> 13:23.200
That's really shitty, Jo.

13:23.880 --> 13:25.520
They don't care, but you know that.

13:25.600 --> 13:26.960
That's not true, Jerry.

13:27.040 --> 13:30.120
Four years since my accident.
Four years.

13:30.200 --> 13:32.520
I can't even get them
on the phone these days.

13:32.600 --> 13:34.680
They say I'm better, but look at me!

13:34.760 --> 13:36.240
I mean, is this it?

13:36.320 --> 13:38.000
Is this it?

13:38.080 --> 13:40.120
- Come on.
- Is this really me now?

13:40.200 --> 13:41.840
- Is this me now?
- No, it's fine.

13:41.920 --> 13:43.800
Don't get your hopes up,
Jo, just don't,

13:43.880 --> 13:48.320
because in this room
we are all fucked.

13:48.400 --> 13:49.200
Jerry!

13:49.960 --> 13:51.120
What?

13:51.200 --> 13:53.920
What? Motherfucker Michelle!

13:54.000 --> 13:55.720
You are a fuckface!

13:56.720 --> 13:58.080
Fucknut!

13:58.160 --> 13:59.160
Fuck off!

13:59.240 --> 14:04.080
Get out the fucking way!
Get... Bitch, fucking twat, fuck...

14:19.720 --> 14:21.160
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.

14:28.720 --> 14:32.680
You know, recovery
is different for everyone.

14:34.440 --> 14:36.760
God, I hate it
when my husband's right.

14:39.680 --> 14:44.920
It's like... trying to piece together
a broken vase, isn't it?

14:45.560 --> 14:46.360
In the dark.

14:47.160 --> 14:48.520
On a roller coaster.

14:51.840 --> 14:52.640
Call me...

14:54.280 --> 14:55.880
if you need to talk.

15:01.480 --> 15:02.280
Thank you...

15:03.200 --> 15:04.040
Helen.

15:06.000 --> 15:06.920
I'm...

15:10.360 --> 15:11.880
I don't know what happened to me.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.040
I was at the top of the stairs...

15:17.480 --> 15:19.120
and then I was at the bottom.

15:20.720 --> 15:21.520
Okay.

15:22.280 --> 15:23.200
I think...

15:24.840 --> 15:25.800
I might have...

15:27.520 --> 15:28.320
uh...

15:29.560 --> 15:31.000
I have a history of...

15:37.800 --> 15:40.880
I've done some quite... dark stuff.

15:41.880 --> 15:47.080
And, um... I worry
I could have done this to myself.

15:51.560 --> 15:52.360
Hello?

15:52.920 --> 15:55.080
Oh, hiya.
Uh, I've got a husband here.

16:01.400 --> 16:04.080
Hi, Jo.
Everybody came out and no you.

16:04.160 --> 16:04.960
I'm fine.

16:05.040 --> 16:07.480
Okay, and I've just bumped into...

16:07.560 --> 16:09.320
Sharon. Hello.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.440
I used to be
the manager of a coffee shop

16:11.520 --> 16:14.200
but, uh, can't even tie
me own shoelaces these days.

16:15.280 --> 16:18.000
Still, I was getting fed up
of the daily grind anyway.

16:19.200 --> 16:20.360
The daily grind.

16:20.920 --> 16:22.920
Get it?
It's cause it's a coffee shop.

16:23.920 --> 16:26.280
Jo. Pleased to meet you, Sharon.

16:31.760 --> 16:32.840
What is it?

16:32.920 --> 16:33.800
Was it that bad?

16:34.360 --> 16:35.360
No. It's just...

16:36.680 --> 16:38.160
those poor people.

16:40.840 --> 16:42.840
And that coffee shop woman...

16:43.760 --> 16:46.080
Imagine being stuck
inside that shit joke

16:46.160 --> 16:47.360
for the rest of your life.

16:48.200 --> 16:49.160
That's not you.

16:50.800 --> 16:53.720
But what if I'm not who I was?

16:54.520 --> 16:56.080
What if I'm dangerous?

16:57.440 --> 16:58.640
You're not dangerous.

17:01.080 --> 17:03.640
Can we go home
the normal way, please?

17:03.720 --> 17:05.000
The one I know.

17:05.080 --> 17:06.360
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

17:32.400 --> 17:33.560
Look.

17:33.640 --> 17:35.360
Finn has come down to see me!

17:38.200 --> 17:41.400
Listen, he's gonna have a few things
to talk to you about, okay?

17:43.320 --> 17:44.160
Darling!

17:46.360 --> 17:48.160
Oh. Here!

18:04.040 --> 18:04.840
Mum.

18:05.440 --> 18:06.520
What the hell is that?

18:07.080 --> 18:10.400
I have no idea.
It just came to me when I sat down.

18:12.120 --> 18:12.920
Watch me go.

18:24.400 --> 18:25.520
Come on.

18:49.400 --> 18:52.120
Look, there's...
something I want to...

18:58.800 --> 18:59.880
I left university.

19:02.600 --> 19:03.400
I quit.

19:04.680 --> 19:06.160
I actually only did one term.

19:09.520 --> 19:10.320
You quit?

19:12.520 --> 19:13.600
I told Dad not to...

19:15.720 --> 19:17.080
I wanted to tell you myself.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.960
But then why aren't you here,
at home?

19:27.480 --> 19:29.240
I don't live here anymore.

19:29.320 --> 19:30.120
I moved out.

19:34.520 --> 19:35.880
I'm just gonna check on lunch.

20:06.080 --> 20:07.160
<i>I love you.</i>

20:26.560 --> 20:27.400
What if the...?

20:28.160 --> 20:29.840
What if the old Mum
never comes back?

20:29.920 --> 20:32.760
Hi, Finn. Yeah.
Welcome to the situation.

20:32.840 --> 20:34.240
What if that happens?

20:35.240 --> 20:36.120
Any ideas?

20:37.640 --> 20:38.560
What are we having?

20:38.640 --> 20:39.560
Lasagne.

20:40.440 --> 20:42.320
Great. What about Mum?
What's she having?

20:42.400 --> 20:43.200
Lasagne.

20:43.720 --> 20:45.240
She's started eating meat again?

20:46.000 --> 20:48.840
Oh, come on, it was a fad.
She was wavering.

20:49.360 --> 20:50.720
That's so shady.

20:50.800 --> 20:52.160
It's familiar. It'll help.

20:53.560 --> 20:55.320
And let's keep things civil, eh?

20:59.560 --> 21:02.080
Are we going to talk
about you dropping out of uni?

21:06.480 --> 21:07.280
No.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.840
But we probably should talk about...

21:14.440 --> 21:15.240
What?

21:19.360 --> 21:23.800
Mum, you've spent your whole life
fussing over me, pushing me.

21:24.320 --> 21:26.120
I didn't even want
to go to university,

21:26.200 --> 21:27.480
but you didn't listen.

21:27.560 --> 21:29.640
You just pushed me and pushed me.

21:30.440 --> 21:32.160
You think you're helping,

21:32.240 --> 21:34.680
but you've done it
in the most passive aggressive way.

21:34.760 --> 21:36.960
- That's a bit harsh, Finn.
- Well, it's true.

21:45.080 --> 21:47.080
No one tells you,
when you're pregnant,

21:48.080 --> 21:50.080
that you're going
to pour your heart and soul

21:50.160 --> 21:52.560
into helping your little babies

21:52.640 --> 21:58.040
grow into happy, articulate,
educated people in their own right.

21:58.640 --> 22:00.040
But then one day

22:00.120 --> 22:02.880
all that love and hard work
is gonna...

22:04.280 --> 22:06.400
be thrown right back in your face.

22:15.200 --> 22:16.000
You know,

22:17.040 --> 22:18.200
I have wondered...

22:19.480 --> 22:21.240
what kind of life I'd have if...

22:22.400 --> 22:24.560
if you'd all died in a car crash.

22:25.320 --> 22:27.160
I've thought
about like what kind of life

22:27.240 --> 22:29.080
I would have carved out
for myself if...

22:30.600 --> 22:33.880
I mean,
once the initial grief had passed.

22:33.960 --> 22:35.960
That's a terrible thing to say.

22:37.280 --> 22:39.040
This is all part
of the disinhibition.

22:42.240 --> 22:43.040
Jo.

22:44.680 --> 22:48.120
You know, on the surface,
this family looks so perfect.

22:49.080 --> 22:52.720
- But underneath it's...
- I have no idea where that came from.

22:53.880 --> 22:55.680
That's so dysfunctional.

22:55.760 --> 22:58.000
There's been
a lot of dysfunction lately, Mum.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.560
By the way,
I told you I'm gay last year.

23:02.640 --> 23:04.440
That should probably be on your wall.

23:08.280 --> 23:09.480
Oh, Finn.

23:11.640 --> 23:12.560
Oh, baby.

23:21.080 --> 23:24.440
I'd... really appreciate that

23:24.520 --> 23:27.720
if you would put that
up on the wall.

23:31.840 --> 23:33.600
- You don't remember what you...?
- Finn.

23:39.280 --> 23:40.080
Oh, God.

24:46.080 --> 24:46.920
Finn.

24:49.400 --> 24:50.480
What are you doing?

24:54.840 --> 24:56.440
You should know this stuff.

24:56.520 --> 24:57.360
What stuff?

25:07.960 --> 25:08.760
Finn?

25:09.840 --> 25:10.800
What did I do?

25:11.920 --> 25:13.160
What did I do?

25:14.720 --> 25:16.800
You've got to tell me.
Please, tell me.

25:16.880 --> 25:18.240
What did I do?

25:18.320 --> 25:21.400
- Tell me, please. Tell me.
- Tell you what, Jo?

25:26.160 --> 25:27.840
Love, you were sleepwalking.

25:33.960 --> 25:36.080
Okay? You should go to bed.

26:15.120 --> 26:16.800
You make tea just like my mum.

26:18.440 --> 26:19.640
Is that good?

26:21.120 --> 26:21.920
Bad?

26:25.840 --> 26:26.720
Is your mother

26:27.600 --> 26:31.640
pushy, demanding,
awful, arsehole like me?

26:36.280 --> 26:37.440
Actually, she's dead.

26:38.600 --> 26:39.400
My mum died.

26:42.840 --> 26:44.680
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

26:46.040 --> 26:47.080
Fuck.

26:50.000 --> 26:50.960
How'd she die?

26:52.640 --> 26:55.760
Do you remember those early sunbeds,
the one you lift the lid up on?

26:55.840 --> 26:58.040
- Yeah.
- Well, she was laying in one and...

26:59.040 --> 27:00.160
she sneezed.

27:01.040 --> 27:02.720
Being a woman
who had four children,

27:02.800 --> 27:05.240
it was only
a very little pelvic floor action,

27:05.320 --> 27:08.560
a small amount of urine escaped
and that was that.

27:09.240 --> 27:10.040
Lights out,

27:10.120 --> 27:12.200
literally, she fused
the entire building.

27:13.400 --> 27:14.280
When we buried her,

27:14.360 --> 27:17.160
it looked like she'd done
six months on a Caribbean cruise.

27:20.720 --> 27:21.640
Jesus!

27:23.160 --> 27:24.720
Oh, that's terrible!

27:25.880 --> 27:27.160
She actually had cancer.

27:28.200 --> 27:30.560
But she made me promise
that if anyone asked

27:30.640 --> 27:33.920
I'd make up a different ridiculous
story every single time, so...

27:34.000 --> 27:35.800
She had a funny sense of humour.

27:35.880 --> 27:37.880
She wanted me
to remember that part of her.

27:39.320 --> 27:41.200
Not the chemo.
Not the last few months.

27:44.800 --> 27:46.400
My mother died of cancer too.

27:55.720 --> 27:57.600
My dad has dementia...

27:58.760 --> 27:59.560
and...

28:01.120 --> 28:02.600
I'm scared of going to see him.

28:05.280 --> 28:09.080
I'm scared he won't recognise me
even if I'm standing right there.

28:15.760 --> 28:17.640
- I'm gonna...
- Yeah, see you later.

28:18.360 --> 28:19.320
Thanks for the tea.

28:33.840 --> 28:34.640
Totally would.

28:35.800 --> 28:36.960
Given half the chance.

28:38.960 --> 28:41.000
He could trim my bush any day.

28:42.480 --> 28:43.800
Yep.

28:43.880 --> 28:46.760
He could put his seed
in my flower bed.

28:47.560 --> 28:49.960
And then fuck me
in a threesome with his twin.

28:50.040 --> 28:51.640
Please! Just stop.

28:52.600 --> 28:53.440
What?

28:53.520 --> 28:54.920
Jesus!

28:55.000 --> 28:56.880
Jo, I'm just having a bit of fun.

28:58.800 --> 28:59.680
Please, just...

29:01.080 --> 29:03.320
stop pretending
it's business as usual.

29:04.240 --> 29:05.600
It isn't, is it?

29:07.720 --> 29:10.120
We didn't talk for months last year.

29:11.760 --> 29:12.560
Why was that?

29:14.360 --> 29:16.360
- Did I go bonkers again?
- No.

29:17.720 --> 29:18.560
No!

29:24.800 --> 29:27.680
Right, you did
something that I actually...

29:28.800 --> 29:30.000
thought was quite cruel.

29:31.160 --> 29:32.040
Well, tell me.

29:32.560 --> 29:35.680
Finn got into a relationship
with someone and you didn't like it.

29:36.640 --> 29:39.360
He told me he's gay yesterday, but...

29:42.280 --> 29:44.600
- I don't have a problem with that.
- Yeah.

29:45.160 --> 29:48.920
But... the person
he was involved with was Josh.

29:50.440 --> 29:51.280
Your Josh?

29:52.040 --> 29:53.080
Yeah.

29:55.000 --> 29:59.040
But he's almost 30
and he's such a player.

29:59.120 --> 30:01.840
He's actually 26, and that wasn't...

30:01.920 --> 30:02.720
Wait.

30:05.640 --> 30:09.120
Did Finn leave uni to be with Josh?

30:10.720 --> 30:11.520
Yeah.

30:16.040 --> 30:17.480
You tried to split them up.

30:18.920 --> 30:20.400
That's why we weren't talking.

30:21.840 --> 30:23.120
It was really a big deal.

30:24.120 --> 30:25.400
You wanted me to tell Josh

30:25.480 --> 30:27.400
to put the brakes
on his relationship.

30:27.480 --> 30:29.200
Finn he's gonna break your heart.

30:30.320 --> 30:31.360
But I love him!

30:31.440 --> 30:33.680
And then Josh stopped speaking to me,

30:34.520 --> 30:36.200
and then Finn found out

30:36.800 --> 30:39.320
and I don't think
he's spoken to you for six months.

30:42.200 --> 30:44.840
Sorry, Cathy. I'm gonna have
to steal Jo from you now.

30:44.920 --> 30:46.120
Steal away.

30:48.520 --> 30:49.560
I was just leaving.

30:58.800 --> 31:02.480
Okay. Exhibit... D.

31:03.000 --> 31:06.640
A receipt
for two very expensive meals

31:06.720 --> 31:08.400
in a swanky French restaurant.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.080
- Really?
- And before dinner,

31:11.840 --> 31:14.360
your amazing
husband took you to exhibit E,

31:14.440 --> 31:16.440
a very pretentious art exhibition.

31:23.360 --> 31:25.200
- Did we, uh...?
- No.

31:25.760 --> 31:28.040
We, uh...
I wanted to take you, but, uh...

31:28.840 --> 31:31.840
Right. And what's next?

31:32.640 --> 31:35.560
Uh... theatre stubs.

31:36.360 --> 31:37.640
Eastbourne playhouse.

31:38.600 --> 31:40.480
I'm so glad
we just painted this wall.

31:41.640 --> 31:43.720
<i>The Importance of Being Earnest.</i>

31:43.800 --> 31:46.080
We left early
for the importance of our sanity.

31:47.640 --> 31:50.480
Last year wasn't all dead dogs
and uni dropouts, you know.

31:50.560 --> 31:51.960
We did have some laughs.

31:53.960 --> 31:55.120
Thank you.

32:03.480 --> 32:05.840
...to split up...

32:07.520 --> 32:11.360
Finn and Josh.

32:14.920 --> 32:16.560
- I'm a terrible mum.
- No.

32:17.080 --> 32:19.000
You were just thinking of his future.

32:23.880 --> 32:25.040
There's something else.

32:27.280 --> 32:30.120
You agreed... to lend me,

32:30.200 --> 32:31.120
the company...

32:32.280 --> 32:33.480
some money last year.

32:34.240 --> 32:35.400
Just to tide us over.

32:36.160 --> 32:37.040
I, uh...

32:38.840 --> 32:39.800
I need some more.

32:41.480 --> 32:43.440
So if you could just...

32:47.600 --> 32:48.400
Okay.

32:50.080 --> 32:51.320
What am I signing?

32:51.400 --> 32:54.200
It's just... a small loan.

32:56.840 --> 32:57.640
Okay.

32:58.520 --> 33:00.560
I am sorry,
my head really hurts.

33:02.080 --> 33:04.440
Is it okay to look at this
a little bit later?

33:05.040 --> 33:06.080
Yeah.

33:08.760 --> 33:09.760
Drink some water.

33:56.120 --> 33:59.120
Anyway, the husband
that was having the party announced,

33:59.200 --> 34:02.280
sometimes we get asked
how come you've stayed together

34:02.360 --> 34:04.080
for such a long time, right?

34:04.160 --> 34:05.920
He said something I'll never forget.

34:07.960 --> 34:10.240
Go on Jim. We're all ears.

34:11.160 --> 34:12.360
He said the secret is...

34:24.640 --> 34:29.120
The secret is never fall out of love
at the same time.

34:29.720 --> 34:30.560
Very good.

34:47.920 --> 34:48.800
Whoa.

34:54.880 --> 34:55.680
Rob?

34:59.760 --> 35:04.720
Did we have dinner
with Cathy and Jim somewhere nice?

35:06.640 --> 35:07.440
Yeah, we...

35:08.160 --> 35:09.320
For their anniversary.

35:10.840 --> 35:14.480
Well, then... I just had
my first proper memory.

35:16.520 --> 35:18.600
At least
the first I can make any sense of.

35:19.360 --> 35:22.040
- Are you gonna tell me what it is?
- Yeah.

35:22.120 --> 35:26.600
It was, um, Jim
telling some shit story.

35:26.680 --> 35:29.080
We were all sitting around
with ridiculous grins

35:29.160 --> 35:33.480
while he was going on
about how people stay together.

35:33.560 --> 35:35.920
I can't believe
that of all things you could remember

35:36.000 --> 35:38.320
you've remembered
one of Jim's boring anecdotes.

35:38.400 --> 35:39.400
I know.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.560
<i>You can't tell him
the other things you've remembered,</i>

35:42.640 --> 35:43.440
<i>can you?</i>

35:44.960 --> 35:46.800
Have you taken your pills?

35:46.880 --> 35:47.960
I'm just about to.

35:49.480 --> 35:50.280
Fuck.

35:51.440 --> 35:53.880
Right. Are you sure
you're gonna be okay on your own?

35:53.960 --> 35:55.720
You're going to the post office.

35:56.400 --> 35:57.880
I'll call you if I need you.

38:26.800 --> 38:27.640
What you up to?

38:29.640 --> 38:31.040
I thought you left.

38:31.120 --> 38:32.280
No, I'm just about to.

38:38.000 --> 38:41.800
Listen, nobody wants you to remember
the last year more than I do.

38:43.120 --> 38:43.920
I know that.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.040
But it's a lot of pressure
to put on yourself.

38:46.120 --> 38:47.120
Maybe take it easy.

38:49.400 --> 38:50.600
Don't forget your tablets.

38:51.520 --> 38:52.320
All right.

38:55.920 --> 38:57.760
- I just don't want you to...
- To what?

38:58.480 --> 39:01.800
- You don't want me to what, Rob?
- Nothing.

39:05.400 --> 39:07.160
They're pain killers, you know.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.200
- They're not antidepressants.
- I know.

39:11.280 --> 39:14.600
- This is completely different.
- Yes, it's completely different.

39:17.360 --> 39:19.240
I'm not depressed.

39:19.320 --> 39:20.240
Sorry.

39:21.160 --> 39:23.040
Oh, my God, this is not 15 years ago.

39:25.040 --> 39:26.800
This is not

39:27.640 --> 39:29.800
that which cannot be mentioned.

39:35.360 --> 39:36.320
Okay.

39:36.400 --> 39:38.920
I will take them. Here. No, look.

39:45.360 --> 39:46.160
Happy?

39:46.240 --> 39:47.680
Yeah. Thank you.

39:49.240 --> 39:50.160
I'll see you later.

40:09.040 --> 40:10.760
<i>Definitely the right thing to do.</i>

40:11.760 --> 40:13.320
<i>Way too many side effects.</i>

40:14.200 --> 40:16.680
<i>Better to be in pain
than confused, right?</i>

41:08.480 --> 41:09.280
Jo!

41:14.680 --> 41:16.400
Shit, Jo. Are you okay?

41:17.360 --> 41:20.280
- Yeah.
- Sorry. I should've called first.

41:20.840 --> 41:24.240
Well... actually, I've been calling
your mobile constantly.

41:24.320 --> 41:25.120
What's happened?

41:26.280 --> 41:28.200
I lost my phone.

41:29.000 --> 41:29.800
Big mystery.

41:30.640 --> 41:31.440
Look.

41:32.200 --> 41:33.080
New one.

41:36.720 --> 41:37.880
I'm sorry, I...

41:39.680 --> 41:41.240
I have no idea who you are.

41:41.320 --> 41:42.240
What?

41:42.320 --> 41:43.440
Who are you?

41:43.520 --> 41:44.880
It's Rose, Jo.

41:45.480 --> 41:47.040
It's Rose. Hello.

41:55.080 --> 41:56.080
You don't remember?

41:56.880 --> 41:58.360
I fell down the stairs.

42:01.040 --> 42:01.840
Right.

42:04.320 --> 42:06.040
I'm sorry, how do I know you again?

42:06.120 --> 42:08.360
We work together, Jo.
Well, we're, um...

42:08.440 --> 42:12.240
I'm a translator.
I work from home on my own.

42:12.320 --> 42:14.280
No, we've been colleagues
for months, Jo.

42:14.360 --> 42:15.160
In town.

42:16.200 --> 42:17.360
We're also friends.

42:21.800 --> 42:25.440
Well, I guess I'd better let you in

42:25.520 --> 42:27.520
so you can tell me
what it is that I do.

42:37.080 --> 42:38.360
I love your place.

42:46.720 --> 42:48.240
Please, come on through.

43:03.560 --> 43:05.640
All right, why don't you tell me

43:05.720 --> 43:12.720
about where I work and what I do
and, uh, when I started?

43:12.800 --> 43:15.640
Yeah, it's a charity.
It's for Syrian refugees.

43:17.880 --> 43:19.040
Oh, right.

43:19.600 --> 43:20.680
Yeah, it's really tiny.

43:20.760 --> 43:25.480
It's basically just you,
me, Nick, a few others.

43:26.840 --> 43:28.160
And Nick is...?

43:28.240 --> 43:29.480
He's the founder.

43:31.880 --> 43:32.680
The boss.

43:36.280 --> 43:37.080
There.

43:38.960 --> 43:39.800
Thank you.

43:43.240 --> 43:44.280
You've been amazing.

43:45.080 --> 43:46.440
Everyone thought it.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.640
You turned the whole place around.

43:48.720 --> 43:50.840
Organised
that amazing fundraising do.

43:52.520 --> 43:53.320
What?

43:53.400 --> 43:55.240
Yeah, that's why
I couldn't figure out

43:55.320 --> 43:56.560
why you stopped coming in.

43:56.640 --> 44:00.840
But Nick said that you just decided
that it wasn't for you anymore.

44:03.560 --> 44:05.760
Hasn't anyone mentioned
that you had a new job?

44:05.840 --> 44:07.720
Don't you think that's a bit...?

44:08.880 --> 44:11.240
And you really
don't remember anything?

44:13.360 --> 44:14.280
Anything?

44:16.080 --> 44:16.880
I...

44:18.440 --> 44:22.560
I think you should leave now.
I feel really tired.

44:22.640 --> 44:24.160
You need to get another dog.

44:24.240 --> 44:26.520
It must be lonely rattling around
here on your own.

44:26.600 --> 44:28.040
Please, can you leave now?

44:28.120 --> 44:30.800
And that's when you dyed your hair...
You've, uh...

44:31.360 --> 44:32.640
- Please?
- Got to put that in.

44:32.720 --> 44:35.520
Please, just get out
of my fucking house.

44:35.600 --> 44:37.320
Get out of my fucking house!

44:45.280 --> 44:46.120
I, uh...

44:50.840 --> 44:52.600
Get out of my fucking house!

44:52.680 --> 44:53.480
Whoa.

44:54.760 --> 44:56.600
That is not
how you speak to friends.

44:59.000 --> 45:00.640
Out! Go!

45:00.720 --> 45:01.520
Get out!

45:09.160 --> 45:10.800
<i>You weren't on our own that night...</i>

45:12.040 --> 45:12.840
<i>were you?</i>
