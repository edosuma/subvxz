00:12.433 --> 00:15.300
Narrator: Coming up,
why are Q and Sal facing off?

00:15.333 --> 00:16.733
Hold it. Hold it.

00:18.900 --> 00:21.067
What's got Murr
coming clean?

00:21.100 --> 00:23.367
An elderly woman passed out
in the men's room.

00:23.400 --> 00:24.767
Cowabunga!

00:25.900 --> 00:27.067
And which losing joker

00:27.100 --> 00:29.300
will be smoked out
in tonight's punishment?

00:32.300 --> 00:35.100
Sal:
Prepare for something amazing.

00:35.133 --> 00:36.167
Q: Hey, mustache, what's up?

00:37.900 --> 00:39.500
Murr:
I want my mommy!

00:41.333 --> 00:44.033
Sal:
I will never forgive you!

00:44.067 --> 00:46.067
Joe: Larry!

00:49.900 --> 00:51.567
Today we're at
Focus Point Global,

00:51.600 --> 00:53.800
giving presentations
about health and happiness

00:53.833 --> 00:55.800
to a roomful of
lifestyle enthusiasts.

00:55.833 --> 00:57.833
But it won't be so easy
because our presentations

00:57.867 --> 00:59.333
have been made
by the other guys.

00:59.367 --> 01:01.133
We'll be in teams,
but this time one of us

01:01.167 --> 01:02.633
will be giving the presentation

01:02.667 --> 01:05.067
and the other will be posing
as an audience member

01:05.100 --> 01:07.067
trying to help his partner
make sense of it all.

01:07.100 --> 01:08.467
At the end,
we'll ask the audience

01:08.500 --> 01:09.900
if anyone learned
anything of value,

01:09.933 --> 01:11.800
and the team with the
fewest hands raised loses.

01:11.833 --> 01:13.467
-That'll be them.
-That'll be you guys.

01:13.500 --> 01:15.400
What the

01:18.233 --> 01:19.767
Got your nerves going.

01:19.800 --> 01:21.467
It's rough, bud.
You're up there by yourself.

01:21.500 --> 01:23.100
You normally have a teammate
up there with you.

01:23.133 --> 01:24.367
Murr: Mm-hmm.

01:26.433 --> 01:27.933
Hey, guys.

01:27.967 --> 01:29.767
Q had a costume change!

01:29.800 --> 01:32.800
Now, Q is like his hype man.
He's got to support anything --

01:32.833 --> 01:34.167
-He's got his back.
-Yeah.

01:34.200 --> 01:35.600
Whatever he says
makes sense.

01:35.633 --> 01:38.000
Okay, so, today
what we're workshopping

01:38.033 --> 01:40.433
is Live Healthy and Die Happy.

01:40.467 --> 01:41.767
Okay?

01:41.800 --> 01:43.167
Focus on new experiences.

01:43.200 --> 01:44.567
Just this week, guys,

01:44.600 --> 01:48.400
I traveled,
I tried a new food...

01:48.433 --> 01:49.900
I started a fire.

01:54.533 --> 01:57.133
I took a kid out
into the middle of the woods.

01:58.667 --> 02:00.533
Did you go camping?
'Cause it looks like --

02:00.567 --> 02:01.733
-Ah!
-Yeah.

02:01.767 --> 02:03.433
-Very good.
-Q, good work, man.

02:05.367 --> 02:06.767
And I got a massage...

02:10.300 --> 02:13.733
...from a real person
from Thailand.

02:13.767 --> 02:16.700
I got it when
I traveled to Thailand.

02:16.733 --> 02:18.633
-I got what you meant.

02:20.300 --> 02:21.767
So, we want to do
what makes us happy.

02:21.800 --> 02:23.500
For instance, I've been
working on a comic book

02:23.533 --> 02:26.667
starring my very own superhero
for the past 30 years.

02:26.700 --> 02:28.100
This is a labor of love.

02:28.133 --> 02:29.933
It gives me pleasure.
I'm still writing it.

02:29.967 --> 02:32.767
She can do anything
that a man can do.

02:32.800 --> 02:35.633
Murr: There's your
30-year comic.

02:36.900 --> 02:38.433
Man:
Actually, just thinking of it,

02:38.467 --> 02:40.200
anything that I didn't get done
in 30 years

02:40.233 --> 02:42.133
would be emblematic
of a lack of accomplishment

02:42.167 --> 02:43.600
for me and a negative.

02:43.633 --> 02:46.100
Wow.
This guy's on Sal's case.

02:46.133 --> 02:48.167
It's the journey,
not the ending.

02:48.200 --> 02:51.467
My question is, over 30 years,
why weren't you more productive?

02:51.500 --> 02:53.333
You're thinking that
I didn't get it done

02:53.367 --> 02:55.300
so I didn't put work into it.
But not true.

02:55.333 --> 02:57.633
It sounds like we're all
saying the same thing, really.

02:57.667 --> 03:00.467
In a way, it sounds like
we're saying the same thing.

03:00.500 --> 03:02.267
He's like, "No, we're not.
No, we're not."

03:02.300 --> 03:05.700
30 years for a comic book
is just ridiculous.

03:05.733 --> 03:07.600
Not true. His goal was
to do it in 30 years.

03:07.633 --> 03:09.900
-That's a strange goal.

03:09.933 --> 03:12.033
A strange goal, but it's
his personal goal, right?

03:12.067 --> 03:13.633
So we're all saying
the same thing.

03:13.667 --> 03:15.033
We're all saying
the same thing.

03:15.067 --> 03:16.633
-It's all good.

03:16.667 --> 03:19.567
Rome wasn't built in a day.
This is my Rome.

03:21.833 --> 03:24.267
What's that?

03:25.500 --> 03:27.033
Time for broccoli.

03:27.067 --> 03:28.933
Next to you, there's
a box on the floor.

03:28.967 --> 03:31.600
Hand out the broccolis
to everybody.

03:31.633 --> 03:33.967
You all get to
take broccoli home.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
Murr: Oh, they're going for it!
She loves it.

03:36.033 --> 03:37.633
Oh, this is so cool, man.
Thank you.

03:37.667 --> 03:39.333
Just one each.
It's all fresh.

03:39.367 --> 03:40.967
-It's washed.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.167
-This is good.
-Oh, Q's supporting him.

03:43.200 --> 03:44.600
It's good broccoli.

03:44.633 --> 03:46.700
They're eating it!
Did this backfire on us?

03:46.733 --> 03:48.167
I don't know.
It might have.

03:48.200 --> 03:51.167
Will one of you come up
and present the next slide?

03:52.300 --> 03:53.633
-I would love to, yeah.
-Great.

03:53.667 --> 03:56.200
You just hit this --
this button right here.

03:56.233 --> 03:58.367
Okay.
Work Out Pals.

03:58.400 --> 04:01.633
Watch us do face-to-face,
standing team push-ups,

04:01.667 --> 04:04.133
pushing ups
against each other.

04:06.200 --> 04:08.400
You're gonna come
opposite me here.

04:08.433 --> 04:12.400
And then you're gonna
want to lean in, okay?

04:13.667 --> 04:15.933
And now push out.
Push out.

04:18.233 --> 04:19.733
Murr:
This is a funny visual.

04:19.767 --> 04:21.333
Joe: Look at the people!

04:21.367 --> 04:24.167
She's holding broccoli,
watching two grown men!

04:24.200 --> 04:25.600
Murr: Hold it.

04:25.633 --> 04:28.100
Push back.
It's about your core.

04:28.133 --> 04:29.567
Yeah, I feel it.

04:32.433 --> 04:34.933
Uh, name some sources
of stress in your life.

04:36.833 --> 04:39.300
Man: Work.

04:39.333 --> 04:40.833
Get out.

04:42.367 --> 04:46.167
Time for broccoli!
Ber-ber-ber!

04:46.200 --> 04:49.267
I knew it wasn't gonna go
on the first round, so...

04:49.300 --> 04:51.600
Murr: Look at her face.

04:51.633 --> 04:53.867
Look, she's wrapping
her broccoli up.

04:53.900 --> 04:56.133
Joe:

04:56.167 --> 04:57.700
Man:
Click the next one.

05:00.467 --> 05:02.200
Last chance for broccoli.

05:02.233 --> 05:04.067
-Yes!
-If you want some more.

05:04.100 --> 05:05.867
I'm really --
Why don't you take the bag?

05:05.900 --> 05:07.333
Oh, thanks, man.
That's cool.

05:07.367 --> 05:09.400
Murr: Q's going home
with a bag of broccoli.

05:09.433 --> 05:11.167
Sal: That was your
last chance for that.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.600
Thank you, guys,
so much for listening.

05:13.633 --> 05:16.767
So, just by show of hands,
how many of you think

05:16.800 --> 05:21.333
that this presentation might be
ready to go on the road?

05:21.367 --> 05:22.533
Murr: Here we go.

05:22.567 --> 05:25.400
-One, two, three.
-Three.

05:25.433 --> 05:27.367
-We got to beat three.
-No problem. We can do it.

05:29.533 --> 05:32.233
Hey, everybody.
How you doing? Welcome.

05:32.267 --> 05:34.467
Sal:
Look at this tool.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.233
Who are you --
Jerry Seinfeld with that outfit?

05:38.933 --> 05:41.600
Today we're talking about how to
get the most out of your life.

05:41.633 --> 05:42.867
Okay?

05:42.900 --> 05:44.767
Murray is teaming up
with Joe

05:44.800 --> 05:47.567
and trying to help convince
the rest of the room

05:47.600 --> 05:50.033
that the presentation
is good.

05:50.067 --> 05:52.933
So, live long and die happy.

05:52.967 --> 05:54.800
Does gender affect happiness?

05:54.833 --> 05:57.067
Women and men are equal
and exactly the same.

05:57.100 --> 05:59.200
So, everybody knows that.

05:59.233 --> 06:02.033
A man can complain/cry
just as much as a woman.

06:04.767 --> 06:06.400
Murr, support him.

06:06.433 --> 06:08.933
-That's right.
-Yeah, that's right.

06:12.800 --> 06:15.433
Remove negative influences
from your life. Okay?

06:15.467 --> 06:18.133
It's his daughter
and his four dogs.

06:18.167 --> 06:20.067
What's negative
in this picture?

06:20.100 --> 06:22.267
Q:
Hit the spacebar.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.900
Yeah, the baby's
the worst influence, right,

06:27.933 --> 06:29.300
'cause it takes up
a lot of time.

06:29.333 --> 06:30.867
-No, no, no.

06:30.900 --> 06:32.133
That means
get rid of the dogs.

06:32.167 --> 06:34.500
-The opposite.
-Murray.

06:34.533 --> 06:37.900
Yeah, you got to keep
the baby, and, uh...

06:37.933 --> 06:39.533
-Maybe not.
-Oh. There you go.

06:41.200 --> 06:42.600
You were right, though.

06:42.633 --> 06:45.067
Getting rid of those influences
really helps you positive.

06:45.100 --> 06:47.900
-Right.
-Oh, nice way to turn it around.

06:47.933 --> 06:50.267
Okay.
My personal struggle.

06:50.300 --> 06:51.567
-Right.
-Oh, nice way to turn it around.

06:51.600 --> 06:54.000
with the devastating effects
of male pattern baldness.

06:56.067 --> 06:58.133
I really feel
self-confidence is plunging.

06:58.167 --> 06:59.867
This is what
I have to deal with.

06:59.900 --> 07:02.167
I have to look in the
mirror. I have to pretend
I have enough to spike.

07:05.267 --> 07:08.833
Would anyone here like to share
their devastating bald story?

07:10.400 --> 07:12.100
I started losing it
when I was 20,

07:12.133 --> 07:14.300
and now I've hit 40,
and it's still devastating.

07:14.333 --> 07:16.567
It's probably even more
devastating at this point,

07:16.600 --> 07:18.433
my male pattern baldness.

07:18.467 --> 07:20.367
Yeah, yeah.

07:20.400 --> 07:21.933
It's devastating.

07:24.400 --> 07:25.833
-Okay. Eat more fish.
-Yes.

07:25.867 --> 07:28.000
Joe: There's health benefits
to fish, right?

07:28.033 --> 07:29.167
Yes, yes, yes.

07:29.200 --> 07:31.500
Lower risk of heart attack
or stroke.

07:31.533 --> 07:33.800
Fish is an excellent source
of vitamin D.

07:33.833 --> 07:35.633
-Sure.

07:35.667 --> 07:39.933
D-Levels.
Test group A had lower D-Levels.

07:41.333 --> 07:43.633
-Test group B, medium D-Levels.
-Oh, my God.

07:43.667 --> 07:45.867
Test group C -- D-Levels
through the roof, right?

07:45.900 --> 07:47.233
This group ate the most fish.

07:47.267 --> 07:49.200
The people that didn't eat
the most fish, lower.

07:49.233 --> 07:52.033
People in the middle
did okay. They're working
with what they can.

08:00.267 --> 08:02.367
Joe: Okay.
Thank you, guys.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.233
Show your hands
if you think this presentation

08:04.267 --> 08:05.900
is ready to be taken
on the road.

08:05.933 --> 08:08.000
-Yes.
-Okay, put it up high.

08:09.533 --> 08:11.900
It's not ready?
It needs a little more work?

08:14.033 --> 08:15.767
Narrator:
Joe and Murr were no dream team,

08:15.800 --> 08:18.667
so they're stuck together
on the loser board.

08:18.700 --> 08:20.467
Today we're at the mall
working as custodians

08:20.500 --> 08:22.833
carrying around these nifty
little walkie-talkies.

08:22.867 --> 08:25.100
At some point, the guys
are gonna give us a line

08:25.133 --> 08:27.233
that we must use to
answer the crazy question

08:27.267 --> 08:29.433
that's about to come
over the walkie.

08:29.467 --> 08:31.833
Everybody's gonna be able to
hear the question. Everybody.

08:31.867 --> 08:35.267
The question is, will we
have the guts to answer it?

08:35.300 --> 08:39.367
If you refuse to answer
the question, you lose.

08:39.400 --> 08:44.000
**

08:44.033 --> 08:46.167
Murr:  Does he have
his shirt all the way open?

08:46.200 --> 08:47.567
Joe:
He took his undershirt off.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.067
Yes.

08:49.100 --> 08:51.333
You look like you're
on work release.

08:51.367 --> 08:53.233
I do these things
for you guys.

08:53.267 --> 08:55.567
Q, I want you to say
"a little cold downstairs."

08:55.600 --> 08:58.000
Q: All right.
Oh, how are you doing, sir?

08:58.033 --> 09:00.467
Is that bothering you?
I can get that cleaned
up for you right there.

09:01.733 --> 09:05.167
-Excuse me one second.

09:05.200 --> 09:06.867
Hello.

09:06.900 --> 09:08.833
Hey, uh,
how's your wife?

09:12.500 --> 09:14.467
A little cold downstairs.

09:16.967 --> 09:19.433
I'll come back and get
this later. Thank you.

09:21.300 --> 09:24.567
Okay, you ready, Q?
The answer is gonna be
"those are the rules."

09:24.600 --> 09:26.333
Those are the rules.

09:26.367 --> 09:28.300
Excuse me.
Everything going okay over here?

09:28.333 --> 09:30.933
Everything clean?
No problems?

09:30.967 --> 09:33.633
-Yeah, you got Brian.

09:33.667 --> 09:35.700
So you're saying
your son can't date a girl

09:35.733 --> 09:37.367
because she's Asian?

09:40.400 --> 09:42.667
Come back.

09:45.900 --> 09:48.267
Murr: Come on.

09:55.700 --> 09:59.833
All right, Joe.
Your answer -- "Repeat that."

09:59.867 --> 10:01.767
Repeat that.
Oh, like I missed it.

10:01.800 --> 10:03.033
All right.

10:03.067 --> 10:05.000
How's it
going today, bud?

10:05.033 --> 10:06.700
Very well, thank you.

10:06.733 --> 10:09.200
-Hey, Joe.
-Go for Joe.

10:09.233 --> 10:10.700
Joe, your sister
dropped off

10:10.733 --> 10:12.267
your prescription
hemorrhoid cream.

10:12.300 --> 10:15.333
All you can say
is "repeat that."

10:15.367 --> 10:16.900
Repeat that?

10:16.933 --> 10:20.333
Your sister dropped off your
prescription hemorrhoid cream.

10:20.367 --> 10:22.433
Uh, repeat that.

10:22.467 --> 10:23.700
Your sister, she dropped off

10:23.733 --> 10:25.467
you prescription
hemorrhoid cream.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.167
I'm losing you after "sister."
Repeat that.

10:28.600 --> 10:30.267
Oh, hemorrhoid cream.
That's what he said.

10:30.300 --> 10:31.900
Hemorrhoid cream.
Yeah, that's great.

10:31.933 --> 10:33.767
I'll come up and grab it.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.433
Yeah. You all --
You're done with that?

10:35.467 --> 10:37.000
-Yeah. Thank you.
-Okay, great, man.

10:37.033 --> 10:39.833
Joe, you're gonna say,
"Deep down, I know I
have it inside of me."

10:39.867 --> 10:41.533
Deep down I know.

10:41.567 --> 10:44.133
-Joe, Joe, come in, Joe.
-Yeah, go for Joe.

10:44.167 --> 10:45.533
Have you seen my pen?

10:49.367 --> 10:51.800
Yeah, deep down, I know
I have it inside of me.

10:53.467 --> 10:54.800
No, I'm looking
for my pen.

10:54.833 --> 10:57.100
The fountain pen from
the office. I need it.

10:57.133 --> 10:59.433
Yeah, deep down,
I know I have it inside of me

10:59.467 --> 11:00.633
is what I'm saying.

11:02.067 --> 11:04.367
-Yeah, straight up inside.

11:11.800 --> 11:14.133
Okay, Sal, you know, Christmas
is right around the corner.

11:14.167 --> 11:15.367
Right around
the corner.

11:15.400 --> 11:17.200
It's always just
a number of days away.

11:17.233 --> 11:19.367
So you have to say,
"Ho, ho, ho."

11:21.600 --> 11:24.433
If you get up and you
exit this way, just be
careful right there.

11:24.467 --> 11:25.733
Hey, Sal, come in.
Sal, you there?

11:25.767 --> 11:27.067
Sal. Come in.
This is Sal.

11:27.100 --> 11:29.567
Hey, Sal, how would you
describe your sisters?

11:34.567 --> 11:36.233
Ho, ho, ho.

11:38.533 --> 11:41.233
I have three s--
I have three sisters.

11:43.733 --> 11:45.133
If you come this way
when you get up,

11:45.167 --> 11:46.700
just be a little careful
right here, okay?

11:46.733 --> 11:49.300
Sal, "in progress."
"In progress."

11:49.333 --> 11:51.533
Almost --
Almost done for the day.

11:51.567 --> 11:54.267
-Come in, Sal.
-Go for Sal.

11:54.300 --> 11:59.633
Did you get a chance to
talk to that pretty blonde
eating the salad yet?

12:02.133 --> 12:03.533
In progress.

12:05.367 --> 12:07.267
Yeah, yeah!

12:07.300 --> 12:08.633
Anywho...

12:10.633 --> 12:12.467
Joe: All right, here we go.
Murr's up.

12:12.500 --> 12:15.733
Murr: There's no water in
the bucket. Isn't that weird?

12:15.767 --> 12:17.667
-No, it's a dry mop.
-No, it's not.

12:17.700 --> 12:20.500
There's no such thing as a
dry mop. It makes no sense.

12:20.533 --> 12:23.300
All right, buddy,
you have to say, "Cowabunga."

12:23.333 --> 12:24.967
Cowabunga.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.967
Guys, you have any garbage
you need me to take for you?

12:28.000 --> 12:29.867
James
Are you out there?

12:29.900 --> 12:31.967
Yeah, this is James.
Come in.

12:32.000 --> 12:36.300
An elderly woman
passed out in the men's room.

12:36.333 --> 12:38.200
Cowabunga!

12:43.000 --> 12:45.467
Anything else, guys?
You good?

12:45.500 --> 12:47.967
Joe: Why isn't there
any water in your bucket?

12:50.267 --> 12:52.200
Seems odd.

12:53.633 --> 12:54.900
-Murr.
-Yeah.

12:54.933 --> 12:56.800
Q: You just got to say
the word "good," buddy.

12:56.833 --> 12:58.533
Good. No problem.

12:58.567 --> 13:00.233
You really think
it's gonna be no problem?

13:00.267 --> 13:01.633
I can say the word "good"
all day.

13:01.667 --> 13:02.967
Let's get at it, then.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.067
Hi, guys. Do you have any trash
you need me to take?

13:05.100 --> 13:07.200
Yeah, of course.
That's my job.

13:07.233 --> 13:09.133
Sal: Hey, Murray.
Are you there, buddy?

13:09.167 --> 13:10.100
-Excuse me one second.

13:10.133 --> 13:11.533
Yes, copy. This is James.

13:11.567 --> 13:13.000
The test came back, dude.

13:13.033 --> 13:15.533
My father -- He's only
got six months to live.

13:15.567 --> 13:17.767
Oh, my God.

13:22.933 --> 13:24.067
Good.

13:26.733 --> 13:28.033
Maybe you misheard me.

13:28.067 --> 13:30.000
I didn't say that
the test came back okay.

13:30.033 --> 13:32.000
I said it went
the opposite direction.

13:32.033 --> 13:33.300
My father, who I love,

13:33.333 --> 13:34.867
he's only got six months
to live, buddy.

13:34.900 --> 13:36.767
He's only 50.

13:36.800 --> 13:38.833
I just don't understand
why you said "good."

13:40.233 --> 13:42.533
I take it back.
I take it back.

13:42.567 --> 13:44.533
So you lose.

13:44.567 --> 13:46.800
Copy.

13:49.333 --> 13:51.267
Narrator:
It's over and out for Murr,

13:51.300 --> 13:54.400
making him tonight's big loser.

13:54.433 --> 13:56.600
Well, Murr's our loser!

13:56.633 --> 13:57.800
Hey, buddy,
you're gonna be

13:57.833 --> 13:59.367
a walking public-service
announcement.

13:59.400 --> 14:00.967
-Okay.
-All you got to do, buddy,

14:01.000 --> 14:02.967
is go up to people
who are smoking cigarettes,

14:03.000 --> 14:05.033
rip them out of their mouths,
and put them out.

14:05.067 --> 14:06.633
-No!
That's it?

14:06.667 --> 14:08.400
Sal: This is a simple one
but a deadly one.

14:08.433 --> 14:10.333
The nearest hospital,
is it, um...?

14:10.367 --> 14:11.933
Up your ass
and to the left.

14:15.167 --> 14:16.900
Q: People smoke to relax,
calm their nerves.

14:16.933 --> 14:18.800
Joe: Right, and Murray does
the opposite effect.

14:18.833 --> 14:20.400
We're gonna get
a punch here today, boys.

14:20.433 --> 14:22.333
Yeah, I'm hoping.
Right here, Murr.

14:22.367 --> 14:24.500
Murr, this guy's
on the phone, bro.

14:24.533 --> 14:26.900
You can try and swoop in.

14:31.433 --> 14:33.800
It's right there.

14:33.833 --> 14:35.733
He's gonna burn
his stupid fingers.

14:35.767 --> 14:37.900
He's gonna think you're
trying to pick his pocket.

14:37.933 --> 14:39.533
-Swoop in.
-Get it.

14:42.767 --> 14:44.800
-I can't.
-Come on, buddy!

14:44.833 --> 14:47.700
The longer you wait,
the shorter the cigarette gets.

14:47.733 --> 14:49.700
-That's how it works.
-Yeah.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.833
-Super smooth, man.
-All right, so, move on.

14:58.867 --> 15:00.500
The search continues.

15:00.533 --> 15:02.333
Murr: You try this.
You see how hard this is.

15:02.367 --> 15:04.400
-I don't have to try it, buddy.
-Yeah, he won.

15:04.433 --> 15:06.200
I mean, you get
how the show works?

15:06.233 --> 15:08.667
Murr: Here we go. This guy
with a cigarette in his mouth.

15:11.167 --> 15:12.433
-Oh!
-It's bad for you.

15:12.467 --> 15:14.500
It's bad for you.
That's the thing.

15:14.533 --> 15:17.067
That was like a Band-Aid.
He just ripped it.

15:17.100 --> 15:18.967
You know, the surgeon general
has these warnings.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.967
It's like --
What it does --

15:22.000 --> 15:23.667
Yes.

15:23.700 --> 15:26.733
And, um,
you're wel-come.

15:26.767 --> 15:28.600
-The guy can't believe it.
-He's stunned.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.200
-He's coming up to you.

15:33.233 --> 15:34.767
-The guy's following him.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.833
Q: There he is.
There he is.

15:40.233 --> 15:42.167
You know what it is?
It's, um...

15:42.200 --> 15:45.700
They're bad for you, and I-I
saw you hadn't lit it yet,

15:45.733 --> 15:47.367
so I thought I'd maybe,
like, you know --

15:47.400 --> 15:49.100
'Cause a lot of people
struggle with hav--

15:49.133 --> 15:50.967
with being able to quit.

15:54.433 --> 15:55.767
No.

15:57.233 --> 15:58.867
I had your best interests
in mind.

15:58.900 --> 16:00.133
I saw that you
hadn't lit it yet,

16:00.167 --> 16:01.567
and you were there
for like two minutes.

16:01.600 --> 16:03.200
In that moment, I thought,
"He's on the fence.

16:03.233 --> 16:05.200
He's debating whether to do it."
So I thought I'd help.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.067
Yeah.

16:11.233 --> 16:12.967
Okay.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.400
He's British,
which explains why

16:14.433 --> 16:16.633
he's not decking Murray
right now.
Yes, yes, yes.

16:18.600 --> 16:20.867
Yes.

16:20.900 --> 16:23.033
Noted. Noted.

16:23.067 --> 16:25.300
And apologies.
Um, okay.

16:27.667 --> 16:29.900
-Oh, wow, Murr.
-Wow, buddy.

16:29.933 --> 16:31.533
-Cheers to you on that.
-That was rough.

16:31.567 --> 16:33.200
Oh, my God. Guys...

16:33.233 --> 16:34.733
Every time it resets,

16:34.767 --> 16:36.900
it's back to as tense
as it can possibly be

16:36.933 --> 16:38.867
'cause you never, ever know
what will happen.

16:38.900 --> 16:41.167
Q: This woman.

16:41.200 --> 16:44.200
Guys, I'm sorry. Do you know
where Stone Street is?

16:46.167 --> 16:47.633
I don't know.
I'm trying to --

16:47.667 --> 16:49.033
I'm trying to think of --

16:49.067 --> 16:50.633
Oh, he's got it!

16:53.933 --> 16:55.667
Oh, my God.

16:55.700 --> 16:57.400
She is pissed.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.400
You know,
it's not good for you.

16:59.433 --> 17:01.933
That's why I thought --

17:04.233 --> 17:05.700
-Oh, that was bad.
-And there it is --

17:05.733 --> 17:07.267
our first "get the
out of here."

17:07.300 --> 17:09.533
-Wow!
-I feel like such a jerk.

17:09.567 --> 17:11.433
Come on, Murr.
Let's go. Next person.

17:11.467 --> 17:14.500
Joe: Ah, she's got
a cigarette.

17:14.533 --> 17:16.400
He's got to put them out.

17:16.433 --> 17:18.767
It's a match made
in heaven.

17:21.067 --> 17:23.333
Now you're just gonna
creepily follow her?

17:28.000 --> 17:31.033
Sal: My God. That's rough!
Oh, my God!

17:33.333 --> 17:36.067
-This is freaking rough.

17:41.300 --> 17:43.800
-I put the cigarette out.
-Oh, my God.

17:52.333 --> 17:54.967
Ooh, ooh.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.100
Sal: Oh, my God.

17:56.133 --> 17:57.733
It's so nerve-racking.

17:57.767 --> 17:58.900
All right.
You're not done yet, man.

17:58.933 --> 18:00.600
My heart is racing.

18:00.633 --> 18:03.400
Dude, lunch hour.
It's a lunch hour.

18:03.433 --> 18:05.000
We got plenty to go.

18:05.033 --> 18:06.500
Joe: All right.
Here's a fellow right here.

18:06.533 --> 18:08.533
Phone and cigarette.

18:09.700 --> 18:11.167
Is that, um...

18:11.200 --> 18:13.367
-He's got it.
-Oh! Oh, my God.

18:13.400 --> 18:15.833
Oh, my God.

18:15.867 --> 18:17.967
They're unhealthy.
It's all on the box.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.167
I'm just trying
to help you quit.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.300
-Wait, wait, wait.

18:22.333 --> 18:23.900
All right, if you just
crush the box of cigarettes,

18:23.933 --> 18:25.100
you're done, buddy.
Oh, yeah.

18:25.133 --> 18:26.600
Crush the whole box,
and you're done.

18:26.633 --> 18:29.000
-I'll give you that.
-Um --

18:31.033 --> 18:33.400
Let me show you what it says
on the box.

18:33.433 --> 18:35.467
No, I'm not gonna do that.
I promise.

18:39.433 --> 18:41.167
Q: Look. He's holding it
behind his back from him!

18:41.200 --> 18:43.333
Let me sh-- Let me --

18:43.367 --> 18:44.500
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

18:44.533 --> 18:45.833
I just want to show --

18:47.033 --> 18:48.733
Let me just show you
what it says.

18:48.767 --> 18:52.033
Joe: Look at him!

18:55.000 --> 18:57.867
**

19:01.300 --> 19:04.133
This guy's got some attitude
towards life. I like him.

19:05.967 --> 19:07.633
Just give me the pack.
Just give me the pack.

19:07.667 --> 19:09.600
It's all over
once I get the pack, bro.

19:09.633 --> 19:10.733
No.

19:10.767 --> 19:14.133
It's all over once
I get the pack, bro.

19:14.167 --> 19:15.467
Q:
"What is wrong with you?"

19:15.500 --> 19:17.933
We've been asking that question
for decades.

19:21.267 --> 19:23.033
I'm kind of at my job.

19:24.900 --> 19:27.133
I want to say this in a nice
way, but just give me the pack.

19:27.167 --> 19:28.533
All right.
I'll give you the pack.

19:28.567 --> 19:31.333
You give me the --
your jacket.

19:31.367 --> 19:33.100
Not quite a fair trade.

19:34.433 --> 19:35.900
It's Murray's
tailored jacket.

19:35.933 --> 19:39.000
-Yep, which isn't cheap.
-No.

19:39.033 --> 19:40.967
What'd they do
on the inside here?

19:41.000 --> 19:42.567
Oh, wow.
Look at that.

19:42.600 --> 19:44.000
You got to give him
your jacket, bro,

19:44.033 --> 19:46.367
or just go smack more cigarettes
out of people's mouths.

19:46.400 --> 19:48.067
It's up to you.

19:48.100 --> 19:49.900
Okay.
Trade on three?

19:49.933 --> 19:51.733
-Deal.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.700
-Look at him.
-You win.

19:54.733 --> 19:56.400
-This guy's awesome!
-There it is!

19:56.433 --> 19:59.400
-Oh!
-You did it, buddy.

19:59.433 --> 20:00.833
Q: Nice work, pal.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.433
Enjoy my jacket.

20:06.133 --> 20:07.567
Joe: Well, the good news is,
it's over,

20:07.600 --> 20:09.233
but the bad news is
he didn't get punched.

20:09.267 --> 20:12.200
He did lose his jacket
that he loves, though,
and I'll take that.

20:12.233 --> 20:13.900
That was an extra layer
we didn't see coming.

20:13.933 --> 20:17.167
This guy's bumming a
cigarette now. He's
trying to get a cigarette.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.400
-Nice.
-And that's it.

20:20.433 --> 20:22.133
Q: Nice, Murr.

20:25.500 --> 20:27.100
James Murray just got smoked,

20:27.133 --> 20:29.100
and now you're gonna see
a behind-the-scenes look

20:29.133 --> 20:30.433
of how it happened,

20:30.467 --> 20:32.733
plus I'll show you bonus footage
from tonight's episode.

20:32.767 --> 20:35.500
Welcome to
"Impractical Insider."

20:35.533 --> 20:37.133
So, today's punishment
is pretty cool

20:37.167 --> 20:38.867
because the proximity
of the punishment

20:38.900 --> 20:41.500
is close to the
NorthSouth Productions offices,

20:41.533 --> 20:44.000
and you can hear some laughter

20:44.033 --> 20:46.467
that's coming out of this room
over here,

20:46.500 --> 20:48.667
and the reason why is...

20:53.100 --> 20:55.600
...'cause right now you got
Joe Gatto working hard.

20:55.633 --> 20:59.267
I'm legitimately interrupting
him as he's working.

20:59.300 --> 21:01.833
We have episodes
we need to make.

21:01.867 --> 21:03.633
-I'm sorry.
-Okay, okay.

21:03.667 --> 21:06.067
Casey: Why Murr for this
punishment specifically?

21:06.100 --> 21:07.700
He's got an oily charm
about him

21:07.733 --> 21:10.467
that I think, like,
he can make it funny.

21:10.500 --> 21:12.667
Like him weaseling
his way out

21:12.700 --> 21:15.233
is as funny as him
getting punished.

21:15.267 --> 21:16.433
Yeah.
Exactly, exactly.

21:16.467 --> 21:18.267
If I do it, I'm gonna
get into a fight.

21:18.300 --> 21:19.667
I put off that vibe.

21:19.700 --> 21:22.400
What's up with this punishment?
I see there's more security.

21:22.433 --> 21:24.467
We actually doubled up
our security

21:24.500 --> 21:27.267
than what we typically have
on a given "IJ" shoot.

21:27.300 --> 21:31.333
Not every punishment is
intended to upset people.

21:31.367 --> 21:33.833
Murr:  Holy
Somebody's gonna punch me.

21:33.867 --> 21:36.400
This is like when Murray didn't
give people their change back.

21:36.433 --> 21:39.000
-That's $3.
-Right. $3 we get back.

21:39.033 --> 21:40.233
-No, no.

21:40.267 --> 21:41.667
-Give the lady her change!

21:41.700 --> 21:43.600
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!

21:43.633 --> 21:46.033
Things are getting intense
down here.

21:46.067 --> 21:47.633
Well, Murray's our loser.

21:47.667 --> 21:50.433
Yeah, today Murr
is our public-service
announcement, as well.

21:50.467 --> 21:52.467
Murr, when were you promoted
to attorney general?

21:53.800 --> 21:56.400
Surgeon general,
not attorney general.

21:56.433 --> 21:58.067
Keep it in.
Keep it in.

21:58.100 --> 21:59.667
Q: Murr, this guy's
on the phone, bro.

21:59.700 --> 22:01.400
You can try and swoop in.

22:01.433 --> 22:02.967
Hey, I'm sorry.

22:04.467 --> 22:07.267
Super smooth, man.

22:07.300 --> 22:08.500
Murr: Excuse me.

22:08.533 --> 22:10.267
Do you, um, do you know
where Stone Street is?

22:10.300 --> 22:11.867
I'm trying
to get to the subway.

22:11.900 --> 22:13.467
Oh, the subway,
you go straight.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.133
-So the --

22:15.167 --> 22:17.200
Well, no, I'm just --
So, the train is which way?

22:17.233 --> 22:18.767
Which way is it?
It's this way you think?

22:18.800 --> 22:21.067
Yeah. Do you want a hit
of my cigarette?

22:21.100 --> 22:23.033
No, no, no, no.

22:23.067 --> 22:26.667
So, where do I go?
I go up like two blocks here?

22:26.700 --> 22:27.900
What do I...?

22:27.933 --> 22:29.400
Go.

22:34.267 --> 22:35.900
Turn off the TV.

22:35.933 --> 22:37.667
Television program
is often lacking

22:37.700 --> 22:39.333
in cognitive neuron stimulation.

22:39.367 --> 22:42.033
That's true.
Right? You're sitting there.
You're zoning out.

22:42.067 --> 22:44.600
It's tru.
TV is horrible.

22:44.633 --> 22:46.767
Q: It's true.
TV is horrible.

22:49.867 --> 22:51.867
Joe:
Ready to go when you are, bud.

22:51.900 --> 22:53.400
Yeah, I'm frozen.

22:53.433 --> 22:55.167
All right, Elsa,
get in there.

22:56.367 --> 22:57.700
-Hi!
-Oh, my God!

22:57.733 --> 22:58.867
Oh! Ugh.

22:58.900 --> 23:00.133
Shh!

23:00.167 --> 23:01.900
-Oh, she knows him.
-Ah, a fan.

23:01.933 --> 23:03.867
What are you doing? Why didn't
you text me that you were here?

23:03.900 --> 23:05.433
I told you guys to tell me
if you're downtown.

23:05.467 --> 23:07.267
-I work -- This is my office.

23:07.300 --> 23:08.733
Why would he tell you
in the area?

23:08.767 --> 23:10.367
I'm gonna go get a cigarette.
You want to go get one?

23:10.400 --> 23:12.167
I'll get you one.
Come on. I'll be back.

23:12.200 --> 23:13.933
H-Hold on.
No, we're filming right now.

23:13.967 --> 23:16.167
Is that why there's
cameras everywhere?
Yes.

23:16.200 --> 23:17.900
And I have to go grab
people's cigarettes

23:17.933 --> 23:19.267
and throw them
to the ground.

23:19.300 --> 23:20.867
-Yes, that's why.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.133
-Wait.

23:22.167 --> 23:23.900
She's not a fan.
She thinks she knows him.

23:23.933 --> 23:27.467
Wait. This is, um -- This is --
This is the show, um...

23:27.500 --> 23:29.400
-Oh, my God.

23:29.433 --> 23:31.867
No. No.
I know you from TV.

23:31.900 --> 23:33.867
Now she knows the show?!

23:33.900 --> 23:35.200
Who did you think
I was?

23:35.233 --> 23:36.533
I thought you were
my friend Liam.

23:36.567 --> 23:37.933
Am I on TV right now?

23:37.967 --> 23:39.067
You thought I was
your friend Liam?

23:39.100 --> 23:40.567
Wait. Can I get
a picture with you?

23:40.600 --> 23:43.800
-I don't know what's going on!
-I can't believe I'm with you!

23:43.833 --> 23:45.767
-Oh, my God. I love your show.
-Thank you.

23:45.800 --> 23:48.067
How do you not know
your own friends?

23:48.100 --> 23:50.433
-Murray, Murray.
-Yes, it's Murr.
