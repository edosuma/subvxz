00:05.930 --> 00:07.179
Motherfucker.

00:07.283 --> 00:08.381
I've been concerned.

00:08.487 --> 00:11.745
Any improvement is likely
a placebo effect.

00:11.851 --> 00:13.264
I'm not going to have
my sons grow up

00:13.381 --> 00:15.172
with some humiliating
picture of me.

00:15.266 --> 00:17.935
Lesser men have come back
from greater scandal.

00:18.042 --> 00:19.492
- What do you want?
- ( moaning )

00:19.639 --> 00:20.662
Is that your wife
in that picture?

00:20.761 --> 00:22.803
Nah, a couple of good-time
girls or so.

00:22.919 --> 00:25.783
My parole officer-- he wants something
and I don't know what it is.

00:26.004 --> 00:28.639
- She's clear, right? - As long as she
keeps pissing clean, we're cool.

00:28.749 --> 00:30.033
Otherwise, it's another 5K.

00:30.155 --> 00:31.750
Mac, I think it's time
for the boys to go home.

00:31.879 --> 00:33.788
What's the price tag
on that little operation?

00:33.905 --> 00:35.934
- 10.3 million.
- The riots were unfortunate.

00:36.042 --> 00:38.072
In the meantime, we are fast
approaching the annual vote

00:38.207 --> 00:39.758
<i>to cover the city's</i>
<i>expenditures.</i>

00:39.873 --> 00:41.016
There can be
no push-back.

00:41.129 --> 00:42.843
Years back, we began to acquire

00:42.991 --> 00:44.728
all that surrounds the project.

00:44.845 --> 00:47.496
I suggest you unload it while you
can still recoup your investment.

00:47.597 --> 00:50.208
You should know you'll be
receiving wide-ranging subpoenas

00:50.324 --> 00:53.166
<i>in conjunction with the corruption
cases you set in motion.</i>

00:54.720 --> 00:57.091
Look at that--
not a word redacted.

00:57.207 --> 00:58.237
You gotta find your own proof,

00:58.342 --> 00:59.793
'cause I'll deny
this ever happened.

00:59.896 --> 01:02.940
City Hall town car went

<i>of mindless compliance.</i>

03:05.392 --> 03:07.052
The borrowing has to stop.

03:08.905 --> 03:10.475
The vote to issue bonds
comes up every year,

03:10.614 --> 03:14.068
and every year
the measure is approved

03:14.447 --> 03:16.348
and public services continue.

03:17.495 --> 03:20.019
Now is not the time

03:20.579 --> 03:22.448
Look, this deficit
has been kicked

03:22.553 --> 03:25.164
down the road for far too long.

03:25.281 --> 03:27.120
Property damage from the riots,

03:27.293 --> 03:29.855
overtime for police and fire,

03:29.982 --> 03:33.467
the cost of evicting and housing
Lennox Gardens residents--

03:33.570 --> 03:36.094
all of this has tipped
the city over the edge.

03:36.479 --> 03:40.589
Chicago is, in fact,
on the verge of bankruptcy.

03:40.987 --> 03:43.874
Limited closures of parks,
libraries, community centers.

03:43.993 --> 03:46.071
- Thank you, Robin.
- Band-Aids.

03:46.738 --> 03:48.419
Small ones at that.

03:48.739 --> 03:51.270
It'd be irresponsible
for us to let you persist

03:51.432 --> 03:53.184
without oversight.

03:55.909 --> 03:57.718
Exactly when did
you become the speaker

03:58.013 --> 03:59.662
for the entire city council?

04:01.483 --> 04:04.569
The decisions you've made have
repercussions, Mr. Mayor.

04:04.692 --> 04:05.928
As have yours,

04:06.877 --> 04:09.543
which is why you'll never
sit behind this desk.

04:15.186 --> 04:17.024
<i>Your so-called</i>
<i>corruption sweep</i>

04:17.696 --> 04:20.334
left an acute personnel gap.

04:20.872 --> 04:23.500
Four ward bosses
and an alderman

04:23.607 --> 04:25.103
were relieved of their duties.

04:25.213 --> 04:28.309
And you would like
to fill those positions

04:29.806 --> 04:31.501
with your associates.

04:31.920 --> 04:34.649
A budget deadline
is in two days.

04:35.555 --> 04:36.910
No changing that.

04:38.594 --> 04:39.780
Work with me here,

04:39.894 --> 04:43.328

passes without issue.

04:44.681 --> 04:46.095

Jackie: <i>Maggie Zajac

05:08.145 --> 05:10.204

05:10.803 --> 05:12.183
Trying to get a hold
of the terms now,

05:12.452 --> 05:15.390
see if we have a child custody
battle on the horizon.

05:20.965 --> 05:23.817

- Sure.

05:29.618 --> 05:30.970
Jackie:
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

05:31.097 --> 05:33.189
- You stole his phone records?
- <i>Shh.</i>

05:33.306 --> 05:36.330
Obtained. Obtained.
And don't rat me out.

05:38.678 --> 05:42.368
Where is area code 905?
And what is Alternalive?

05:43.637 --> 05:45.416
It's a brain clinic in Toronto.

05:45.519 --> 05:46.529
<i>Meredith Kane called there</i>

05:46.631 --> 05:48.578

05:52.257 --> 05:53.630
This one's for free.

05:54.746 --> 05:56.490
Well, maybe I want
to be indebted.

05:56.692 --> 05:58.713
Just don't be more trouble
than you're worth.

05:59.455 --> 06:00.362
( knocks )

06:04.667 --> 06:05.467
Ben:
<i>It's become clear</i>

06:05.590 --> 06:07.469
<i>that Kane and I don't</i>
<i>share the same values.</i>

06:07.578 --> 06:09.107
And I'm assuming
you feel the same,

06:09.441 --> 06:11.823
given the subpoenas
served to his office.

06:11.954 --> 06:13.772
20 years' worth, no less.

06:14.232 --> 06:16.377
There was a blurb
about it in the "Ledger."

06:18.374 --> 06:19.914
Due diligence.

06:20.076 --> 06:23.132
We're prosecuting corruption
charges against five individuals

06:23.233 --> 06:25.651
who may or may not have
interfaced with the mayor.

06:28.334 --> 06:30.129
You have managed to get
elected year after year

06:30.238 --> 06:31.680
without Kane's support.

06:32.482 --> 06:35.327
And it's tempting to chalk that
up to divine intervention, but--

06:35.450 --> 06:37.799
You a churchgoer,
Mr. Zajac?

06:38.162 --> 06:39.781
Lapsed.

06:39.968 --> 06:41.891
Been thinking I should return.

06:42.007 --> 06:43.458
I have a lot to answer for.

06:44.187 --> 06:45.814
Well, His forgiveness
comes easily.

06:45.927 --> 06:47.892
All you have to do is ask.

06:48.384 --> 06:51.655
The public's is another matter.

06:52.908 --> 06:54.925
It's no small task,
but I want to try.

06:55.721 --> 06:58.526
<i>And I think,</i>
<i>in spite of my sins,</i>

06:58.738 --> 07:00.543
I can still serve
the state well.

07:01.049 --> 07:02.922
My strength as a prosecutor

07:03.021 --> 07:05.314
has always been
recognizing talent.

07:05.459 --> 07:07.173
I make it a point
to surround myself

07:07.277 --> 07:08.998
with impressive people.

07:09.674 --> 07:11.890
Claire sees something in you,

07:12.091 --> 07:13.897
and I trust her judgment.

07:14.789 --> 07:16.892
Well, I would be grateful
for your support.

07:17.020 --> 07:18.506
You're aware my position
makes it unethical

07:18.614 --> 07:20.650
to publicly back
any one candidate.

07:20.752 --> 07:22.673
I would never ask you
to stump for me.

07:27.486 --> 07:30.050
The State's Attorney
is a firm believer

07:30.219 --> 07:33.032
in public transparency.

07:34.067 --> 07:35.706
Once that's achieved,

07:36.251 --> 07:38.745
perhaps connections
can be made.

07:45.314 --> 07:46.898
I'm in.

07:48.028 --> 07:49.736
<i>( Mac laughs ) Ah!</i>

07:49.918 --> 07:52.330
I assumed we'd be
meeting privately, Tom,

07:52.816 --> 07:55.490
but it certainly has been nice
spending time with your staff.

07:55.603 --> 07:57.838
No sense in restricting a
rare visit from our governor.

07:57.969 --> 08:00.343
It's an honor for these young
people to be in your presence.

08:00.648 --> 08:02.393
Oh.
( laughs )

08:02.977 --> 08:05.398
They may even learn
a thing or two in the process.

08:10.275 --> 08:13.557
It pains me to be
the bearer of bad news,

08:13.660 --> 08:16.602
particularly in this
less-than-private setting,

08:16.823 --> 08:19.329
but with the state's
belt so tight,

08:19.587 --> 08:21.533
I'm sure you understand
why we'll have to pass

08:21.648 --> 08:24.553
this $10 million expense
onto the city.

08:24.732 --> 08:27.987
<i>Frankly, I wasn't sure that</i>

08:28.121 --> 08:30.688
calling in the Guard
was really necessary,

08:30.824 --> 08:33.919
but I agreed
at your office's urging.

08:34.010 --> 08:36.881
I'd like to thank you for taking the
time to advise me of this personally.

08:37.034 --> 08:38.413
I happened to be in town.

08:38.683 --> 08:40.923
<i>Scheduled to address</i>
<i>the bright future</i>

08:41.015 --> 08:43.047

08:43.184 --> 08:45.091
I should tell them
to look for work in China.

08:45.201 --> 08:46.552
( laughs )

08:48.405 --> 08:49.625
( awkward chuckling )

08:49.867 --> 08:53.451
Four mutually beneficial
terms together, you and I.

08:53.827 --> 08:56.220
Now here we are at the
twilight of your governorship.

08:56.742 --> 08:58.924
Twilight indeed.

08:59.468 --> 09:02.254
Yours, too, perhaps
at this rate.

09:02.470 --> 09:03.929
<i>Shocking, really,</i>

09:04.375 --> 09:07.135
<i>that things should be</i>
<i>so economically dire here.</i>

09:07.232 --> 09:09.982
You've always been
such a good manager.

09:12.185 --> 09:15.401
State bonds-- enough
to ride out the storm,

09:15.496 --> 09:17.725
allowing a proper plan
to be put into place.

09:17.981 --> 09:19.732
Issued immediately.

09:27.062 --> 09:30.071
Is this really the legacy
you wanna leave behind, Mac?

09:30.393 --> 09:34.276
The reputation of allowing the
state's largest city to go under?

09:37.227 --> 09:41.093
Whatever I decide, you'll need
more than just my approval.

09:41.447 --> 09:45.349
Take a picture of Mr. Zajac
swallowing this pill, will you?

09:46.848 --> 09:49.546
Our state treasurer knows
that what's good for Chicago

09:49.663 --> 09:51.610
is good for Illinois.

09:53.861 --> 09:56.607
Once upon a time
I believed the same.

10:02.786 --> 10:04.381
Nice man.

10:06.410 --> 10:08.060
Nice man.

10:13.853 --> 10:16.433
All right, let's get
Zajac on the books,

10:16.547 --> 10:18.129
and then we'll circle
back to Cullen.

10:18.914 --> 10:20.628
If the lame-duck governor
needs a crumb or two

10:20.733 --> 10:22.671
thrown at him, so be it.

10:24.024 --> 10:26.926
( silent )

10:34.174 --> 10:35.999
Something's happening with him.

10:36.354 --> 10:38.017
Probably just
a little dehydrated.

10:38.601 --> 10:40.117
Here, this'll fix him up.

10:40.235 --> 10:42.513
No, it's more than that.
He's different.

10:44.150 --> 10:45.717
He's trying to communicate.

10:46.168 --> 10:47.645
What's he trying to say?

10:52.891 --> 10:57.118
Grandpa, do you understand
what I'm saying?

10:57.589 --> 10:59.464
Do you know who I am?

11:02.692 --> 11:05.224
Here, this will calm him.

11:05.663 --> 11:08.234
- Which one is it?
- Bulbocapnine.

11:19.865 --> 11:21.339
<i>( phone ringing )</i>

11:21.484 --> 11:23.099

11:43.068 --> 11:45.267
Sorry, I missed it.

11:45.698 --> 11:46.834
That's fine.

11:51.390 --> 11:53.643
You know,
he really should rest.

11:55.477 --> 11:56.478
<i>( recording ) This is Emma.</i>

11:56.587 --> 11:58.126
<i>Leave me a message</i>
<i>and I'll get back to you.</i>

11:58.228 --> 11:59.410
Darius: <i>Hey, what's up?
It's me again.</i>

11:59.542 --> 12:02.607
Just wanted to make sure
things worked out

12:02.713 --> 12:05.205
with you and that guy
you were telling me about.

12:06.373 --> 12:08.016
I haven't heard from you
in a while, so--

12:08.152 --> 12:10.216
can you call me?

12:11.745 --> 12:14.547
- There he is.
- What the fuck is this, yo?

12:14.944 --> 12:17.869
- Where you been, cuz?
- Yeah, man, I was, um--

12:18.803 --> 12:20.454
- I was just trying to--
- Doesn't matter.

12:20.559 --> 12:23.798
That bag you dropped--
light at least five grand.

12:23.911 --> 12:26.357
Right, right.
I was trying to help out, you know?

12:26.495 --> 12:28.138
- Like, since the Gardens is gone,
- Hmm.

12:28.298 --> 12:31.114
I figured I'd work it
for you out here, you know?

12:31.217 --> 12:34.143
And just needed some start-up
money to invest in the product.

12:34.251 --> 12:38.020
- You know what I'm saying?
- Look at my guy, making investments.

12:38.152 --> 12:40.530
Mr. Motherfuckin'
Wall Street.

12:41.073 --> 12:43.038
Do I look like
your bank, nigga?

12:44.749 --> 12:46.202
Look, man,
I'll get you the money.

12:46.788 --> 12:48.534
You're motherfuckin' right
you will.

12:50.415 --> 12:52.130
Get the fuck off me.

13:08.243 --> 13:09.863
I'm assuming you'll call
the state treasurer's office

13:09.974 --> 13:12.201
and get Zajac to sign off
on the bonds?

13:12.764 --> 13:15.071
Mr. Zajac's hardly in the
position to hold us up.

13:15.399 --> 13:17.200
And at this moment,
I'm more concerned about

13:17.325 --> 13:19.663
filling the alderman's seat
in light of the upcoming vote.

13:19.777 --> 13:20.832
And I'm more concerned about

13:20.939 --> 13:23.123
circumventing the vote
with the bonds.

13:23.218 --> 13:25.292
Plus, if Ross does have
the majority on this,

13:25.462 --> 13:27.219
one open seat won't matter.

13:27.371 --> 13:29.305
Understood,
but filling the vacancy

13:29.391 --> 13:31.428
with the right person
is no less important.

13:32.245 --> 13:33.529
Woman:
<i>Miss Fredricks?</i>

13:34.213 --> 13:36.921
My name's Karen.
This is my son Cole.

13:37.443 --> 13:40.642
- We met at the Gardens.
- Yes, of course. Have a seat.

13:42.622 --> 13:44.044
Go ahead without me.

13:46.701 --> 13:49.147
I think you grew up
around the corner from me.

13:49.286 --> 13:50.489
<i>I remember you.</i>

13:51.480 --> 13:53.280
Did real good for yourself.

13:54.796 --> 13:56.964
I hope everything
is going all right

13:57.052 --> 13:59.479
- with your temporary home situation.
- Yeah.

13:59.584 --> 14:02.462
They got us out in East Garfield.
Not too bad.

14:02.580 --> 14:05.053
<i>Pretty far from my work,</i>
<i>though, and church.</i>

14:05.165 --> 14:07.025
But it's only
for two years, right?

14:07.980 --> 14:08.743
Right.

14:08.866 --> 14:12.365
<i>I know it's a long time, but,
he misses his cousins!</i>

14:12.722 --> 14:16.054
- <i>With everybody scattered</i>
<i>every which way...</i> - I'm sure.

14:16.167 --> 14:17.548
I was hoping we could be closer

14:17.673 --> 14:20.038
to where the rest
of my family is.

14:20.377 --> 14:22.633
Until we can all
go back home, I mean.

14:24.926 --> 14:26.591
I'll see what I can do.

14:30.109 --> 14:32.805
Hartlep, Errickson--
both fine prospects

14:32.937 --> 14:34.793
to finish out the term
as Alderman of the 11th.

14:34.896 --> 14:36.347
Hand me that thing.

14:38.167 --> 14:40.395
You're telling me this is
the entirety of my options?

14:41.086 --> 14:42.268
With your
anticorruption efforts,

14:42.372 --> 14:44.252
a less-than-pristine
replacement for that seat

14:44.360 --> 14:46.015
could prove a PR vulnerability.

14:46.128 --> 14:47.797
Those individuals
are of the highest caliber.

14:47.898 --> 14:49.509
What about Campbell?
Why isn't he on this list?

14:49.627 --> 14:52.289
He and Alderman Ortiz remain at
odds over a contract dispute.

14:52.379 --> 14:53.841
Ortiz, being one of your
staunchest supporters,

14:53.944 --> 14:55.402
might not appreciate
the gesture.

14:55.525 --> 14:56.992
Then whom do you suggest?

14:58.155 --> 15:00.275
Ideally someone young, loyal,

15:00.680 --> 15:01.844
<i>an outsider without the taint</i>

15:01.953 --> 15:03.881
<i>of a long-held</i>
<i>political position.</i>

15:05.204 --> 15:06.945
My wife suggested
Kenneth Prentiss.

15:07.043 --> 15:08.964
She's worked with him before
on several occasions.

15:09.067 --> 15:11.834
His organization coordinates
private funds with city grants

15:11.947 --> 15:14.402
to help provide services
for several women's shelters.

15:14.498 --> 15:16.577
- Prentiss Safe Houses? The NGO?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

15:16.694 --> 15:17.879
Sir, I believe they--

15:17.977 --> 15:19.644
<i>He's well-liked,</i>
<i>well-respected,</i>

15:20.290 --> 15:21.677
knows all the players.

15:23.104 --> 15:25.229
Prentiss. Done.

15:25.726 --> 15:28.151
I'll set it up, have you swear
him in as soon as possible.

15:32.844 --> 15:34.348
( sighs )

15:35.268 --> 15:36.700
Fist bump, buddy.
( imitates explosion )

15:36.808 --> 15:38.032
Show me your muscles.
Show me, show me.

15:38.132 --> 15:40.039
Errh! That's what
I'm talking about.

15:40.170 --> 15:41.733
It's good to see you guys.
I'll see you next time, okay?

15:41.804 --> 15:43.550
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, dad.

15:44.292 --> 15:45.976
Thank you for bringing them by.

15:46.715 --> 15:47.777
Of course.

15:48.644 --> 15:49.943
They really miss you.

15:53.839 --> 15:55.379
Where are you staying
these days?

15:55.832 --> 15:58.404
Hotel.
Two bedrooms.

15:58.524 --> 16:01.281
You know, so if they could
ever sleep over sometime...

16:02.371 --> 16:03.653
Maybe.

16:04.477 --> 16:06.391
I'm surprised you haven't
shut this place down.

16:09.461 --> 16:11.507
A lot can happen between
now and November.

16:12.696 --> 16:14.079
Okay.

16:14.666 --> 16:16.566
And so you know--
I agreed to an interview.

16:16.690 --> 16:19.641
You also agreed to not comment
publicly about the family.

16:19.794 --> 16:21.986
I know. This is about
me and my candidacy.

16:22.088 --> 16:23.863
I made that
very clear with Jim.

16:24.378 --> 16:25.261
Carpenter?

16:25.393 --> 16:26.689
Are you out of your mind?

16:28.802 --> 16:30.896
I can hold my own
with Carpenter.

16:31.753 --> 16:33.924
And, quite frankly,
I don't have

16:34.047 --> 16:36.373
much of a choice
at this point but to try.

16:36.611 --> 16:40.380
I mean, the only play I have is to face
these allegations as honestly as I can.

16:45.470 --> 16:46.809
It stops being an allegation

16:46.926 --> 16:49.510
when there are pictures of it
on the front page, Ben.

16:49.671 --> 16:52.516
How much more public humiliation
am I supposed to endure?

16:52.626 --> 16:54.744
- I'm not quitting the race.
- Of course not.

16:54.872 --> 16:58.359
God forbid you muzzle your insatiable
ambition for the sake of the family.

16:58.477 --> 17:00.846
Hey, you wanna play devastated housewife
for appearances, that's fine,

17:00.967 --> 17:02.633
but you knew what the ride
was and went along for it.

17:02.778 --> 17:04.493
Don't you dare put this on me.

17:05.009 --> 17:06.436
You kept your eyes
and mouth shut

17:06.567 --> 17:08.890
because the only thing you gave
a shit about was me winning.

17:09.002 --> 17:11.578
- It was the only reason you stayed.
- So why did you?

17:12.589 --> 17:14.767
Boy:
<i>Mom!</i>

17:15.396 --> 17:18.366
If you even gave a shit about
them, you wouldn't do this.

17:29.744 --> 17:31.178
( engine starts )

17:44.184 --> 17:46.197
<i>( air hissing )</i>

17:53.867 --> 17:55.967
- Enjoying your new life?
- Excuse me?

17:56.136 --> 17:58.765
- They treating you well at Linder?
- Yes.

18:00.181 --> 18:02.093
140 over 90.

18:02.223 --> 18:04.783
Still a little high,
but it's an improvement.

18:04.978 --> 18:08.102
I assume you're still taking
the L-dopa, Rivastigmine?

18:08.196 --> 18:10.568
I am, though I'm not
convinced there's a need.

18:10.870 --> 18:12.178
My grip's fine--

18:12.637 --> 18:14.933
no weakness, no shaking,
no tremors.

18:15.674 --> 18:17.839
And what about visions,
delusions?

18:17.938 --> 18:19.761
Any side effects from
the treatment you received?

18:19.879 --> 18:21.427
None whatsoever.

18:21.754 --> 18:25.059
No persistent headaches
or nausea from the ECT?

18:25.172 --> 18:28.090
I am well.
Excellent, in fact.

18:28.478 --> 18:30.057
And your comprehension?

18:30.181 --> 18:31.318
Full, complete,

18:32.452 --> 18:35.795
with a true sense
of clarity now.

18:36.182 --> 18:39.116
Well, that's good to hear.

18:39.239 --> 18:40.954
<i>Doctor, I understand</i>
<i>your skepticism.</i>

18:41.191 --> 18:43.207
But for the first time
since my diagnosis,

18:43.459 --> 18:46.326
I'm without symptom
and complication.

18:47.189 --> 18:50.945
Whatever was done--
it's working.

18:51.740 --> 18:53.382
Thank you, Doctor.

18:57.247 --> 19:00.646
720 and one, two, three.

19:00.915 --> 19:04.071
Congratulations, you've completely
wiped out our petty cash.

19:04.198 --> 19:05.566
What's so urgent you had
to have it today?

19:06.212 --> 19:08.864
Just save your questions
for your sources, okay?

19:09.200 --> 19:11.638
Speaking of which,
Twitter doesn't count.

19:11.735 --> 19:13.739
Find someone real to talk to about
that library closures piece.

19:13.836 --> 19:15.254
Don't forget to save
your receipts.

19:18.715 --> 19:21.509
You're kidding, right?
Toronto, Sam?

19:21.755 --> 19:24.955
You've got meetings, proofs
to go over, rewrites to do.

19:25.077 --> 19:26.197
We're in the age
of Wi-Fi, Jackie.

19:26.298 --> 19:27.944
I don't need to be nailed
down to my desk, okay?

19:28.071 --> 19:29.843
So proof them, push them,
tweak them for me, okay?

19:29.958 --> 19:30.986
Thanks.

19:32.168 --> 19:33.170
If you're not here
tomorrow morning,

19:33.270 --> 19:35.456
I'm putting my name
on your office door.

19:36.382 --> 19:39.349
Is there an ongoing
relationship with Mrs. Ross?

19:39.457 --> 19:40.716
There never was.

19:40.830 --> 19:43.278
It was a single incident,
one that I deeply regret.

19:43.391 --> 19:45.450
Well, had you previously
been unfaithful

19:45.599 --> 19:47.305
to your wife or she to you?

19:47.416 --> 19:48.731
Were there problems at home?

19:50.307 --> 19:52.360
I'm not going to answer
that question, Jim.

19:52.500 --> 19:53.877
Not because I'm afraid
of speaking the truth,

19:53.989 --> 19:55.648
but because I specifically
asked you to leave

19:55.797 --> 19:57.912
my wife and children
out of this discussion.

19:58.379 --> 20:00.260
Ask about me and my candidacy.

20:00.498 --> 20:03.240
Mm, fair enough, fair enough.

20:03.756 --> 20:06.099
So even before
the scandal broke, though,

20:06.253 --> 20:08.077
your opponent, Senator Walsh,

20:08.203 --> 20:09.809
was making headway
in the polls.

20:09.906 --> 20:12.124
She's since pulled ahead.

20:12.246 --> 20:14.821
Now what makes you think
you can still win this race?

20:14.954 --> 20:17.214
Well, despite the misjudgments
in my personal life,

20:17.328 --> 20:19.041
I have the leadership skills,
the knowledge,

20:19.151 --> 20:22.120
and the commitment to
effectively run this state.

20:22.624 --> 20:26.212
Well, would you say you're
a good politician, then?

20:27.494 --> 20:28.885
I'd say I'm good at governing,

20:29.837 --> 20:31.843
having successfully managed
billions of dollars

20:31.927 --> 20:34.002
in state funds during
my time as treasurer.

20:34.905 --> 20:38.268
So being a bad
husband and father

20:38.419 --> 20:41.915
is a consequence
of being good at governing?

20:43.305 --> 20:45.051
Wow.

20:45.643 --> 20:47.705
That-- that's not
journalism.

20:47.852 --> 20:49.524
That's just plain
mean-spirited.

20:49.720 --> 20:53.093
Well, with all due respect,
you touted your family values

20:53.251 --> 20:54.984
<i>as your ticket into office.</i>

20:55.103 --> 20:56.293
And given what we know,

20:56.535 --> 20:58.894
it seems you've been running
on a false platform.

21:01.070 --> 21:03.489
You know what?
This was a bad idea.

21:03.859 --> 21:06.515
I'm done.
Forget it.

21:07.769 --> 21:08.834
Don't you think
we deserve to know

21:08.958 --> 21:10.817
who our elected officials are?

21:11.367 --> 21:12.812
See, that's the thing--
you don't know me.

21:12.916 --> 21:15.290
And you don't know my wife and you
sure as hell don't know my children.

21:15.429 --> 21:18.862
All anyone knows is that I screwed
around and someone took pictures.

21:18.979 --> 21:20.235
<i>That doesn't make me</i>
<i>a bad father.</i>

21:20.350 --> 21:21.584
That doesn't make me a loser.

21:21.708 --> 21:23.390
That doesn't make me
unfit for office.

21:23.513 --> 21:26.543
Even if it happened while you were
actively campaigning for governor?

21:26.644 --> 21:28.158
I made a fucking mistake,

21:28.980 --> 21:30.043
one that I have to pay for

21:30.162 --> 21:31.611
every time I look
into my wife's eyes

21:31.745 --> 21:33.731
and every time my kid
Googles his last name

21:33.859 --> 21:36.838
and he's gonna pull up bullshit
like this disguised as news.

21:39.045 --> 21:41.567
You know what?
You're a liar.

21:51.643 --> 21:53.104
You get all that?

21:53.831 --> 21:55.226
Yeah...

21:55.718 --> 21:58.888
I made a (beep) mistake,
one that I have to live with

21:58.991 --> 22:00.888
<i>every single time I look</i>
<i>into my wife's eyes</i>

22:01.013 --> 22:03.111
and every time my kid
Googles his last name

22:03.222 --> 22:06.347
and pulls up (beep)
like this disguised as news.

22:06.468 --> 22:09.982
He's likeable, relatable,
even in a meltdown.

22:10.268 --> 22:11.753
( sighs ) Yeah.

22:12.101 --> 22:15.297
And if a woman nearly cried
or had a meltdown on live TV,

22:15.455 --> 22:18.891
you'd be hearing terms like "hysterical"
and "unbalanced" being tossed around.

22:18.998 --> 22:21.395
Instead, Zajac will have
just spoken from the heart.

22:21.492 --> 22:23.569
Well, as unfair as it all is,
it's beside the point.

22:24.412 --> 22:26.518
We need to move, fast.

22:26.630 --> 22:28.064
I say we nail him
on his temper.

22:28.174 --> 22:29.548
If he flies off the handle
in an interview,

22:29.651 --> 22:31.274
he's too hotheaded
to lead the state.

22:31.803 --> 22:35.629
We attack him personally, we come
across as being cruelly opportunistic.

22:35.738 --> 22:38.118
She's right.
Stick to the basics.

22:38.233 --> 22:39.514
Bring it back to Kane.

22:39.643 --> 22:41.755
Bankruptcy--
fiscal and moral.

22:42.227 --> 22:43.451
On it.

22:46.861 --> 22:50.049
- Be honest.
- We're fine.

22:50.409 --> 22:51.459
Kane's not
in a position to help

22:51.567 --> 22:55.244
and Ben doesn't have a field
operation without him.

23:01.676 --> 23:03.201
Ben:
What a douchebag.

23:04.467 --> 23:06.975
Fuckin' genius.
Stupid shit.

23:07.080 --> 23:10.142
Don't let the door hit you
in the ass on the way out!

23:12.755 --> 23:14.185
Claire:
<i>Dear God.</i>

23:15.744 --> 23:17.206
Hey.

23:18.153 --> 23:20.145
I suggest not bringing Him
into this.

23:21.676 --> 23:23.374
I keep finding you
with a drink in your hand,

23:23.476 --> 23:25.515
I'm gonna start thinking
there's a problem.

23:26.517 --> 23:28.135
Well, I got plenty of those.

23:28.447 --> 23:29.764
Where do you want to start?

23:29.873 --> 23:31.900
At the failed mea culpa?

23:32.164 --> 23:34.201
Or me embarrassing
my wife and kids?

23:36.567 --> 23:38.070
Good luck catching up.

23:38.478 --> 23:39.930
That wasn't my plan.

23:41.358 --> 23:42.450
Was it to come
and warm your hands

23:42.552 --> 23:44.032
on the funeral pyre
of my career?

23:44.128 --> 23:45.603
Hardly sound like the guy
who will lead us

23:45.713 --> 23:48.424
to tomorrow together.

23:49.971 --> 23:51.176
Anyway.

23:51.879 --> 23:53.748
I'm sorry if I let you down.

23:54.511 --> 23:56.719
You know, I made you look
bad in front of Doyle.

23:57.053 --> 23:58.706
You're clueless.

24:00.113 --> 24:02.309
- Pretty much.
- May I?

24:02.437 --> 24:03.810
Knock yourself out.

24:11.069 --> 24:12.310
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

24:14.658 --> 24:16.914
( groans ) Really?

24:17.024 --> 24:18.250
You wanna torture me
with this shit?

24:18.367 --> 24:20.092
Just shut up and look.

24:22.328 --> 24:23.725
Thanks.

24:24.998 --> 24:28.368
I made a fuckin' mistake,
one that I have to live with...

24:28.473 --> 24:30.224
( laughs ) Well, I
said the f-bomb on TV,

24:30.321 --> 24:32.015
so there should be at least
a million views there.

24:32.152 --> 24:35.080
Just keep looking.
134,000 hits.

24:36.085 --> 24:39.930
"About time a politician
sounded like a human being."

24:41.108 --> 24:44.746
You did it-- exactly
what you needed to do.

24:47.524 --> 24:50.279
- Well, fuck me.
- Not like this, I won't.

24:53.574 --> 24:54.996
Here.

24:55.654 --> 24:56.635
What is that?

24:56.743 --> 24:58.037
Put it someplace safe.

24:59.873 --> 25:02.769
Volunteer database.
Three cycles' worth.

25:03.231 --> 25:05.438
If you can't make good use of
it, you don't deserve the win.

25:19.807 --> 25:23.307

<i>( recording ) This is Emma.</i>

25:33.812 --> 25:36.047
<i>Leave me a message</i>
<i>and I'll get back to you.</i>

( engine starts )

25:43.817 --> 25:46.276
_

26:03.464 --> 26:05.004
Hello?

26:08.219 --> 26:10.081
- Can I help you?
- Hi. Chris Beyers.

26:10.242 --> 26:11.345
Checking in?

26:11.482 --> 26:14.810
Insurance investigator for
Sentinel Health from the States.

26:14.907 --> 26:17.643
- I have an appointment.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Beyers.

26:17.741 --> 26:20.376
I don't seem to have you
in my system.

26:20.725 --> 26:21.736
You should.
I'm here to look into

26:21.855 --> 26:23.883
a number of claims
involving your facility.

26:23.986 --> 26:25.083
Well, I'm not
allowed to give out

26:25.172 --> 26:27.416
that type of information
without a signed release form.

26:27.518 --> 26:28.647
Well, you should have
gotten that already.

26:28.737 --> 26:29.936
The patient's name
is Thomas Kane.

26:30.033 --> 26:31.943
He was admitted here
for treatment recently.

26:32.052 --> 26:33.776
Sir, may I see
your credentials?

26:34.588 --> 26:36.193
All right, look, there's
been some misunderstanding.

26:36.304 --> 26:38.471
I have an appointment.
I sent in the release form.

26:38.993 --> 26:40.528
Obviously it's not your fault.

26:40.628 --> 26:42.068
Can I speak to the supervisor?

26:43.730 --> 26:45.358
Wait here.

27:03.126 --> 27:05.364
- What are you doing?!
- I'm an insurance investigator--

27:05.481 --> 27:08.987
- I'm calling the police. - Look, honestly,
you don't have to do this, okay?

27:09.127 --> 27:11.015
Look, please, please.
Okay?

27:11.114 --> 27:12.968
Forget it.
Just forget it.

27:13.067 --> 27:14.444
I'm gone.

27:20.407 --> 27:23.055
You're saying you won't
affix your signature?

27:24.237 --> 27:26.168
Which as recently as six
months ago was rubber-stamped

27:26.275 --> 27:28.427
on the bottom
of $10 rebate checks.

27:28.529 --> 27:30.626
You won't sign your name,
a name now synonymous

27:30.738 --> 27:32.581
with wanton disregard
for propriety,

27:32.726 --> 27:37.870
to a bond that will keep
this city afloat?

27:39.571 --> 27:41.738
Not at the expense
of the state.

27:43.238 --> 27:44.947
The food chain--

27:45.355 --> 27:50.046
each layer of the hierarchy
struggles, toils, exists,

27:50.216 --> 27:54.163
only to be consumed
by a dominant species.

27:54.349 --> 27:55.871
Sound familiar?

27:56.293 --> 27:58.290
Grass, bugs, birds,

27:58.493 --> 28:00.859
snakes, and so on--

28:00.991 --> 28:02.481
one feeding the next
all the way up

28:02.610 --> 28:04.846
to the commanding
predatory creatures.

28:04.955 --> 28:06.868
That is the order of things.

28:07.015 --> 28:09.622
I want those state bonds
released by tomorrow.

28:13.787 --> 28:15.704
I won't approve
the transfer of funds.

28:16.873 --> 28:19.139
If I'm going to be governor,
I refuse to inherit a state

28:19.271 --> 28:22.044
that's further in the red
to pay your bills.

28:22.151 --> 28:25.831
Are you... going
to be governor?

28:28.912 --> 28:34.285
The numbers, the photos,
my divorce--

28:34.429 --> 28:36.674
you bear as much
responsibility as I do.

28:36.801 --> 28:40.667
I've run a solid campaign and you've
been nothing but a fucking hindrance.

28:41.481 --> 28:43.490
<i>The puppet is cutting</i>
<i>his strings.</i>

28:43.616 --> 28:45.356
If I win, I win on my own.

28:45.750 --> 28:47.535
If I lose, so be it.

28:48.735 --> 28:50.955
Either way, you and I are done.

29:05.790 --> 29:07.482
Sir?

29:12.049 --> 29:13.464
( sighs )

29:15.378 --> 29:17.570
There will no state bonds.

29:19.533 --> 29:21.811
The budget vote is tomorrow.

29:24.991 --> 29:28.005
Great men have compromised
in times of trial

29:28.144 --> 29:30.215
and emerged the stronger.

29:32.250 --> 29:34.352
I intend to be among them.

29:47.281 --> 29:48.877
Come on in.

29:48.995 --> 29:51.794
The vote-- how many
can you guarantee?

29:53.250 --> 29:57.116
My caucus, Progressives,
goo-goos, Independents--

29:57.215 --> 29:58.715
How many?

29:59.476 --> 30:01.842
40, give or take,

30:02.209 --> 30:04.883
all ready to line up
either way.

30:05.083 --> 30:06.957
Could be on your side if...

30:07.330 --> 30:09.373
The alderman's replacement
has already been found.

30:09.539 --> 30:11.854
Four ward bosses.

30:12.299 --> 30:14.022
Authorize
the city bond measure,

30:15.023 --> 30:17.441
you can handpick
whoever you like.

30:18.752 --> 30:21.349
Power in the field
ought to be deal enough.

30:31.525 --> 30:32.971
<i>( elevator bell dings )</i>

30:42.561 --> 30:44.058
Alderman Ross
is presumably holding open

30:44.183 --> 30:46.817
the 21st for
Kenya Taylor's return.

30:47.973 --> 30:49.862
And he'll be appointing
three new ward bosses

30:50.005 --> 30:53.229
to the 11th, the 14th,
and the 46th.

30:53.994 --> 30:55.773
Find out their names.

30:55.917 --> 30:58.576
I'd like to congratulate
them personally.

30:59.405 --> 31:01.797
Unfortunately, I'm a pariah
in those circles now.

31:01.943 --> 31:04.293
- I may not be able to--
- There are other avenues, I'm sure.

31:05.406 --> 31:06.937
I trust your resourcefulness.

31:07.046 --> 31:08.481
Sir, I--

31:09.719 --> 31:11.265
I have to know--

31:11.388 --> 31:13.771
where do things stand
with Lennox Gardens?

31:15.532 --> 31:17.772
I promised you I wouldn't
blindside you, so I won't.

31:18.279 --> 31:19.826
It's no longer viable.

31:20.469 --> 31:24.195
In times of desperation, we must
sometimes sacrifice our darlings.

31:25.814 --> 31:28.673
I realize that not
everyone can come back.

31:28.785 --> 31:32.707
I accept that, but promises
were made by you and by me.

31:33.384 --> 31:36.222
Go back to the original plan--
25% Section 8 housing.

31:36.314 --> 31:37.997
That still has to be possible.

31:38.386 --> 31:39.460
If not, then I've
lost everything

31:39.571 --> 31:42.464
and you've made liars
out of both of us.

31:42.898 --> 31:44.223
Tomorrow,

31:44.485 --> 31:46.715
after we've sidestepped
this bureaucratic nightmare,

31:46.827 --> 31:48.762
we will be solvent
enough to do so.

31:49.288 --> 31:51.442
But without control
of all wards,

31:52.352 --> 31:54.766
I can't guarantee it
and I won't.

31:55.895 --> 31:58.055
Find out their names.

31:58.763 --> 32:00.534
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

32:10.352 --> 32:11.559
<i>( Rutledge groaning )</i>

32:11.966 --> 32:13.726
Grandpa, Grandpa,
Grandpa, Grandpa,

32:13.826 --> 32:16.310
it's okay, it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

32:16.424 --> 32:17.314
You're all right.

32:17.567 --> 32:19.630
Grandpa, you're okay,
you're okay, you're okay.

32:19.737 --> 32:20.718
Grandpa, you're fine.

Grandpa, you're okay.

32:24.272 --> 32:26.392
Grandpa, Grandpa--

something might be wrong.

<i>Don't touch him!</i>

32:36.975 --> 32:38.814
I'll do it!
Just call 9-1-1.

32:43.472 --> 32:45.810
It's my grandpa! He's collapsed,
I need an ambulance!

32:45.934 --> 32:47.188
Mona: <i>I heard you're
looking to take</i>

32:47.295 --> 32:49.841
<i>Kenya Taylor's place</i>
<i>in the organization.</i>

32:50.556 --> 32:52.497
<i>It'd be quite</i>
<i>the promotion for you.</i>

32:52.690 --> 32:54.687
I hope you're up to the task.

32:55.665 --> 32:58.485
The 21st hasn't had
a decent ward boss in years.

32:58.705 --> 33:03.794
Hmm. Well, hopefully,
that's going to change.

33:04.279 --> 33:09.666
Trey, I recognize
we've had our differences

33:09.872 --> 33:12.802
<i>regarding your means</i>
<i>of income at the Gardens,</i>

33:13.054 --> 33:14.663
but let me remind you

33:15.129 --> 33:17.850
that the community
is where my loyalty lies.

33:17.971 --> 33:20.083
Kenya went about his duties
in the wrong way,

33:20.765 --> 33:22.840
which is something
you had a hand in.

33:23.078 --> 33:26.584
Hey, we don't always like
our marching orders,

33:27.780 --> 33:29.172
but we march.

33:29.316 --> 33:30.733
I want the names
of Ross' appointees

33:30.873 --> 33:34.171
in order to preserve a 25%
return rate to the Gardens.

33:34.283 --> 33:37.789
- Privileged information.
- Chapman? Powell?

33:39.263 --> 33:41.926
- Simmons?
- <i>( laughs ) Look.</i>

33:42.055 --> 33:44.274
If you wanted to be
in good with my boss,

33:44.722 --> 33:46.896
maybe leaving his office
for the mayor's

33:47.062 --> 33:49.602
wasn't your best move.

33:49.689 --> 33:51.111
You think?

33:52.639 --> 33:54.748
Ross might have
given you a leg up,

33:54.871 --> 33:57.798
but that's ground level,
minor leagues.

33:57.981 --> 33:59.941
You stay with him,
you stay in the hood.

34:00.527 --> 34:04.158
But realign yourself,
become the mayor's ally,

34:04.286 --> 34:06.185
and I'll give you
what Ross can't.

34:07.405 --> 34:08.755
I'm listening.

34:08.885 --> 34:10.081
Me.

34:10.610 --> 34:12.293
<i>You know my reputation.</i>

34:12.429 --> 34:15.103
I'll vouch for you,
pose for pictures,

34:15.228 --> 34:17.083
<i>help you gain the level</i>
<i>of respect in City Hall</i>

34:17.224 --> 34:19.371
<i>that you already command</i>
<i>on the streets.</i>

34:19.482 --> 34:21.697
<i>In exchange for</i>
<i>those ward boss names,</i>

34:23.574 --> 34:25.422
I'll give you mine.

34:26.018 --> 34:27.378
Tom: <i>An opportunity
was handed to you,</i>

34:27.717 --> 34:29.219
<i>which you took, and rightly so.</i>

34:31.943 --> 34:33.599
<i>You've waited to move up</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

34:33.719 --> 34:35.139
<i>Now here you are.</i>

34:35.538 --> 34:37.992
<i>But you must be made aware of the
realities of your situation,</i>

34:38.089 --> 34:40.014
because I don't want you
maintaining false notions

34:40.766 --> 34:42.313
about what's been offered.

34:42.433 --> 34:43.786
It is not a job.

34:43.889 --> 34:47.679
It is a station
in the community,

34:48.277 --> 34:50.297
both unpaid and unofficial,

34:50.411 --> 34:52.666
<i>a position with some authority,</i>

34:52.817 --> 34:54.839
<i>some recognition,</i>

34:54.974 --> 34:56.809
but that won't pay
the rent, fellas.

34:57.766 --> 35:01.336
Now what I'm offering
is a chance to be salaried

35:01.636 --> 35:04.510
and to serve the city
in an additional capacity.

35:04.939 --> 35:08.419
Transportation, water
management, public health.

35:08.562 --> 35:11.998
Each of you in a legitimate
city job-- pensions, benefits.

35:12.139 --> 35:14.677
I myself worked my way up
to the sanitation department.

35:17.931 --> 35:19.258
And what about Alderman Ross?

35:19.374 --> 35:22.275
Oh, by all means continue serving
him as community leaders.

35:22.536 --> 35:25.308
Think of the ward as your own.

35:25.427 --> 35:26.787
<i>I believe you'll find</i>
<i>that your political duties</i>

35:26.920 --> 35:28.768
and your occupational
responsibilities

35:28.891 --> 35:30.553
will overlap nicely.

35:31.051 --> 35:33.944
I only ask that
my generosity be considered

35:34.071 --> 35:35.690
when the occasion arises.

35:37.118 --> 35:38.701
Scotch, anyone?

35:39.147 --> 35:40.688
Oh, don't look
so nervous, fellas.

35:40.926 --> 35:42.175
It's good scotch.

35:43.592 --> 35:45.889
- Sir, you wanted to see me?
- I do.

35:50.419 --> 35:51.601
Zajac.

35:53.233 --> 35:54.431
He's up.

35:54.544 --> 35:56.885
Good press, and cash donations
are starting to come in.

35:57.050 --> 35:58.722
<i>That was something,</i>
<i>that interview.</i>

35:59.058 --> 36:01.930
He may win this,
perhaps in spite of himself.

36:02.230 --> 36:04.401
You know, the bar isn't
as high as it used to be,

36:04.680 --> 36:07.569
but he's passionate, driven.

36:07.677 --> 36:10.903
I suppose those
are winning qualities.

36:11.533 --> 36:13.241
You honing yours, Claire?

36:14.681 --> 36:17.740
Gamesmanship, assertiveness.

36:17.861 --> 36:20.671
That forthright shamelessness
with which you crave my seat.

36:22.721 --> 36:24.674
We're all here for a reason.

36:25.926 --> 36:28.331
Did I say you could fuck him?

36:30.704 --> 36:32.487
Sir, I--

36:32.614 --> 36:35.020
<i>Both willing in spirit</i>
<i>and weak of the flesh.</i>

36:35.182 --> 36:38.189
I'm not sure whether to feel
admiration or pity.

36:39.927 --> 36:43.518
Were you gonna tell me
at some point?

36:45.437 --> 36:48.228
Honestly, no.

36:50.234 --> 36:53.080
You want to do what I do,
sit where I sit?

36:54.409 --> 36:57.631
Your ambitions belong to me.

36:59.575 --> 37:02.226
How's your wife, Jeff?

37:03.784 --> 37:06.688
She's a goddamn saint, and
you're not to speak her name

37:06.830 --> 37:10.054
or mention her
in any capacity, ever.

37:11.749 --> 37:13.604
Is that understood?

37:20.140 --> 37:22.207
Lift up your skirt.

37:24.380 --> 37:26.141
Do as you're told.

37:36.805 --> 37:38.173
Take that off.

37:59.013 --> 38:00.566
Do it.

38:08.857 --> 38:11.942
<i>( breathing deeply )</i>

38:35.849 --> 38:37.185
Tom: What the hell
am I looking at?

38:37.347 --> 38:39.267
I was vetting Mrs. Kane's
recommendation for alderman

38:39.403 --> 38:42.428
when I found this thread on a
human rights message board.

38:42.718 --> 38:46.361
An anonymous user
going by Citizen541

38:46.547 --> 38:49.453
made a sexual abuse allegation
against Kenneth Prentiss.

38:49.560 --> 38:51.451
Appears to be someone
from one of his shelters.

38:51.600 --> 38:52.923
Prentiss?

38:53.174 --> 38:54.064
That's the guy I'm swearing in

38:54.156 --> 38:56.440
as my new goddamn white
knight on the council?

38:56.561 --> 38:58.225
- Yeah.
- Shit.

38:58.315 --> 38:59.521
I thought it best
you see it now

38:59.799 --> 39:02.484
rather than after posing for
pictures at his swearing in.

39:02.791 --> 39:04.536
News hasn't caught
hold of it yet.

39:04.842 --> 39:06.873
And his organization
isn't commenting,

39:06.997 --> 39:09.765
but as you can see from the
postings, it could get bad.

39:09.869 --> 39:12.198
Prentiss Safe Houses.
The irony.

39:12.310 --> 39:13.942
I can try to track down
the person behind the account

39:14.071 --> 39:15.512
<i>to see if the allegation</i>
<i>has merit.</i>

39:15.651 --> 39:16.841
Don't bother.

39:17.520 --> 39:19.134
Sadly, even unproven claims

39:19.278 --> 39:21.375
have a way of attaching
a certain stigma.

39:21.796 --> 39:23.516
We're going to need
to find somebody else.

39:23.620 --> 39:24.780
It's not too late, sir,

39:25.869 --> 39:27.887
to fill the seat
before the vote.

39:31.219 --> 39:34.146
I know I'm relatively
inexperienced by comparison,

39:34.549 --> 39:37.025
but I'm dedicated, loyal.

39:37.415 --> 39:39.152
I think I've
proven that to you.

39:39.610 --> 39:41.324
<i>And I can be your eyes</i>
<i>and ears there,</i>

39:41.615 --> 39:42.918
an assured vote,

39:44.283 --> 39:47.087
providing support
in any capacity.

39:48.515 --> 39:52.301
Your ambition is boundless.

39:57.305 --> 39:59.685
Ross has already
guaranteed me a majority,

40:00.206 --> 40:02.020
so time is not really
of the essence,

40:02.174 --> 40:06.248
but I will consider it.

40:07.687 --> 40:09.468
Thank you, sir.

40:18.432 --> 40:19.663
( chuckling )

40:23.236 --> 40:24.445
Oh, boy.

40:26.537 --> 40:27.771
That kid.

40:28.824 --> 40:31.434
<i>( traffic blaring )</i>

40:35.376 --> 40:37.097
<i>( door opens )</i>

40:37.208 --> 40:39.262
- How is he?
- <i>( door closes )</i>

40:40.862 --> 40:42.797
Your grandfather is in a coma.

40:46.019 --> 40:47.422
I don't understand.

40:48.117 --> 40:50.128
The doctors are still
running tests.

40:50.253 --> 40:51.516
They're not sure
if it was something to do

40:51.622 --> 40:53.352
with the fall or his meds.

40:55.916 --> 40:58.948
They're saying
he may have missed

40:59.058 --> 41:01.161
a few doses of his regimen.

41:07.669 --> 41:09.341
He's on life support.

41:10.372 --> 41:12.306
Your mother's there
with him now.

41:37.836 --> 41:39.713
( sighs )

41:41.669 --> 41:45.011
_

41:51.708 --> 41:53.608
Sir?

41:53.847 --> 41:55.156
Mayor Rutledge
is in the hospital.

41:55.253 --> 41:57.241
Apparently, he fell
and struck his head.

41:57.345 --> 42:00.247
- How can I help?
- Emma is understandably upset.

42:00.358 --> 42:02.803
I want you to take her home
and try to calm her down.

42:02.914 --> 42:04.434
Aren't I needed here
for the vote?

42:05.343 --> 42:08.396
Other opportunities will present
themselves soon enough.

42:08.617 --> 42:10.729
- Go.
- Yes, sir.

42:13.556 --> 42:15.320
( sighs )

42:38.011 --> 42:40.222
Here's copies
of positive press on Zajac.

42:40.347 --> 42:42.049
It's mostly local,
but it's spreading.

42:42.194 --> 42:44.476
Small-dollar boost
in donations.

42:44.577 --> 42:46.169
- Any new numbers?
- They're still coming in.

42:46.264 --> 42:47.484
There's data for Mercer, Knox,

42:47.579 --> 42:48.574
most of the downstate counties

42:48.687 --> 42:50.027
with the exception of Lawrence.

42:50.284 --> 42:52.560
- Still safe. More to come.
- Cook?

42:52.772 --> 42:54.099
- ( cell phone chiming )
- Still working on it.

42:54.775 --> 42:56.255
- ( sighs ) Fuck.
- What?

42:56.697 --> 42:58.591
Nothing.
Just this guy I'm--

43:02.147 --> 43:04.191
<i>( ringing )</i>

43:06.104 --> 43:07.632
- Hey.
- Hey, it's me.

43:07.772 --> 43:09.999
I need to cancel tonight.
I'm still at work.

43:10.160 --> 43:13.085
Right, right.
Me, too.

43:13.596 --> 43:15.260
- Where are you?
- <i>Uh, what do you mean?</i>

43:15.373 --> 43:16.753
I'm-- I'm chasing a lead.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.740
Oh, okay.
You just sound kind of--

43:18.847 --> 43:20.278
<i>I-- I gotta go.</i>
<i>I'm on deadline.</i>

43:20.398 --> 43:21.936
But rain check on dinner,
though, okay?

43:22.030 --> 43:24.020
- I'm gonna call you.
- Okay.

43:35.813 --> 43:37.231
Kane's office just called.

43:37.350 --> 43:38.956
He wants a sit-down
with Catherine.

43:41.545 --> 43:45.200
<i>( phone ringing )</i>

43:49.882 --> 43:51.036
- Hey.
- Hey.

43:51.176 --> 43:52.377
So Danny's in the bathroom

43:52.464 --> 43:53.994
and Benjy's just finishing
up a game on my computer.

43:54.097 --> 43:55.412
It's fine.
No rush.

43:56.171 --> 43:57.575
It's busier in here.

43:58.199 --> 44:00.038
You hire a new
campaign manager yet?

44:00.150 --> 44:02.858
Nope.
I'm handling it myself.

44:03.410 --> 44:05.196
I'm not sure my last one's
replaceable.

44:07.307 --> 44:08.722
You think it was worth it?

44:08.830 --> 44:10.769
- Maggie--
- I don't know. Maybe it was.

44:16.303 --> 44:17.805
There they are.

44:18.370 --> 44:19.691
Come on, guys.
Let's go.

44:19.908 --> 44:21.170
All right, give me five.

44:21.828 --> 44:22.874
See you, buddy.

44:23.318 --> 44:24.442
- Give me five.
- Let's go.

44:24.956 --> 44:25.706
( imitates explosion )

44:26.812 --> 44:27.983
Bye, guys.

44:28.096 --> 44:29.379
Bye, Dad.

44:30.525 --> 44:31.907
See you, buddy.

44:33.858 --> 44:34.992
This is all you got?

44:35.107 --> 44:37.194
We ran the system
for our missing sniper.

44:37.369 --> 44:40.759
Boetker has no priors
anywhere, no record anywhere,

44:40.872 --> 44:42.698
no real trace of him
since the mid '80s.

44:42.817 --> 44:45.516
I did manage to find this
photograph of his unit, however.

44:45.764 --> 44:47.302
- Aliases?
- We're looking,

44:47.428 --> 44:49.805
but he's been off the grid for
so long, I don't expect much.

44:49.899 --> 44:53.522
- Which one is he? - This one's Langley
and this one here's Boetker.

44:55.799 --> 44:58.531
Well, age up
Boetker's military ID,

44:58.691 --> 45:00.954
pass it through the DMV,
city surveillance.

45:01.278 --> 45:02.609
Maybe that'll get us somewhere.

45:02.707 --> 45:04.067
Should we update
the mayor's office?

45:04.285 --> 45:05.799
The next thing I take to Kane

45:05.944 --> 45:09.461
has to be nothing less
than an actual defendant.

45:13.473 --> 45:15.382
A lot of fight in you,
Catherine.

45:15.544 --> 45:16.962
Always respected that.

45:17.082 --> 45:18.831
I'm just getting started.

45:19.079 --> 45:21.059
After three tries,
you learn a few things,

45:21.194 --> 45:22.691
including how to get
out of the way

45:22.822 --> 45:24.541
when the train's
about to crash.

45:24.828 --> 45:28.392
Suffice to say, I owe you a
debt of thanks for Mr. Zajac.

45:28.580 --> 45:29.744
For Kitty, too.

45:29.884 --> 45:32.858
Actually, she's proven to be
an invaluable addition.

45:32.978 --> 45:34.684
<i>Clearly, we have</i>
<i>the same tastes.</i>

45:35.296 --> 45:37.426
Is it possible, then, I wonder,

45:38.121 --> 45:39.893
for you and I to coexist.

45:40.007 --> 45:43.520
( laughs ) That's hard
to imagine, really.

45:43.634 --> 45:45.650
Working hand in hand
with the man

45:45.778 --> 45:47.795
who referred to me as--
what was it?

45:48.229 --> 45:50.254
"A downstate crone"?

45:50.535 --> 45:52.269
I believe that's
the term you used

45:52.415 --> 45:54.516
when last we spoke privately.

45:54.821 --> 45:56.255
History aside,

45:56.515 --> 45:59.661
I imagine there are
some shared values

45:59.801 --> 46:02.286
between us, a mutual agenda.

46:02.410 --> 46:04.039
You're testing the waters.

46:06.518 --> 46:08.489
Let's not waste
each other's time.

46:08.628 --> 46:11.624
When, not if, I become
the next governor,

46:11.774 --> 46:13.791
I won't be serving
an agenda that defers

46:13.936 --> 46:15.869
to the whims of this office.

46:16.019 --> 46:18.758
You and I will seldom coincide,

46:18.879 --> 46:21.327
legislatively or otherwise.

46:23.018 --> 46:25.948
Well, good luck, then, Senator,

46:27.133 --> 46:29.544
to you and yours.

46:32.223 --> 46:34.917
I'd imagine with your
current financial concerns,

46:35.069 --> 46:36.664
you need it more than I do.

46:44.169 --> 46:46.123
- Sir.
- The vote.

46:47.468 --> 46:49.647
Beginning shortly.
Will you be on the floor?

46:49.768 --> 46:51.097
Nah, it's Williams'
show tonight.

46:51.194 --> 46:53.062
I have no intention
of applauding from the wings.

46:53.212 --> 46:56.196
What comes
as a temporary concession

46:56.633 --> 46:58.643
does not amount to surrender.

46:59.017 --> 47:00.175
Agreed.

47:01.178 --> 47:03.095
<i>I'll be in my office</i>
<i>if you need me.</i>

47:03.216 --> 47:04.562
I got this.

47:10.884 --> 47:12.255
Emma: <i>I should have
watched more closely.</i>

47:12.377 --> 47:14.488
- Ian: You're not his doctor.
- But I had to help.

47:14.716 --> 47:16.997
Emma, what happened to your
grandfather is no one's fault.

47:17.095 --> 47:18.243
You're wrong!

47:24.194 --> 47:26.769
I stopped giving him
the medication.

47:26.918 --> 47:29.635
- The bulbocapnine.
- What?

47:29.908 --> 47:31.971
My parents induced it--
his stupor--

47:32.085 --> 47:34.515
for the last 20 years, and
they've been using that shit

47:34.637 --> 47:36.307
to keep him like this
ever since.

47:36.417 --> 47:38.126
- Mayor Rutledge had a stroke--
- No, I have proof.

47:38.238 --> 47:41.324
- His body is full of it.
- Emma, you're not making any sense.

47:41.972 --> 47:42.819
( stammering )

47:43.766 --> 47:45.123
What?

47:45.247 --> 47:46.600
Are you using again?

47:47.802 --> 47:49.426
- Thanks for the ride.
- Emma.

47:49.982 --> 47:51.216
I'll be fine.

48:19.304 --> 48:20.709
Emma, where are you?

48:22.250 --> 48:23.532
Stop it.

48:23.978 --> 48:25.521
- Leave me alone.
- I said stop it.

48:26.034 --> 48:28.201
- This is not your job.
- Do you wanna go back to jail?

48:30.870 --> 48:32.317
I'd rather be anywhere
than here.

48:32.448 --> 48:33.946
- You don't mean that. Emma, look at me.
- Fuck!

48:34.110 --> 48:35.735
Calm down and look at me.
Look at me!

48:36.824 --> 48:37.946
<i>What are you doing?</i>

48:39.062 --> 48:41.014
Give me that!
Stop it!

48:44.590 --> 48:46.563
- Emma.
- Open.

48:46.665 --> 48:48.744
- Look at me. You're stronger than this.
- No, I'm not!

48:51.384 --> 48:53.061
Please, just--
just let me go.

48:53.183 --> 48:54.354
Please.

49:42.957 --> 49:43.777
( moaning )

49:53.654 --> 49:57.461
<i>( moaning continues )</i>

50:29.546 --> 50:30.815
Clerk over TV: <i>Voting will
now begin on the measure</i>

50:30.945 --> 50:34.148
<i>authorizing continued procurement
of municipal bonds.</i>

50:35.301 --> 50:38.264
- Alderman Reesh.
- Yea.

50:39.779 --> 50:41.781
- Clerk: <i>Alderman Lakowsk--</i>
- <i>( mutes TV )</i>

51:18.534 --> 51:20.332
- ( volume increases )
- Clerk: Quiet in the chambers.

51:20.453 --> 51:21.740
Alderman Ross.

51:21.869 --> 51:23.448
Ross:
<i>I vote nay.</i>

51:23.561 --> 51:25.683
- Clerk: <i>Alderman Holden.</i>
- <i>Nay.</i>

51:25.803 --> 51:27.804
- <i>Alderman Garrison.</i>
- Sir.

51:27.908 --> 51:29.131
<i>Nay!</i>

51:29.356 --> 51:31.698
- <i>Alderman De Soto.</i>
- <i>Nay.</i>

51:31.955 --> 51:34.703
- <i>Alderman Castellers.</i>
- <i>Nay.</i>

51:34.958 --> 51:37.457
- <i>Alderman Louis.</i>
- <i>Nay.</i>

51:37.948 --> 51:40.644
- <i>Alderman Thomas.</i>
- <i>Nay.</i>

51:41.254 --> 51:43.746
- <i>Alderman Kursh.</i>
- <i>Nay.</i>

51:44.010 --> 51:47.192
- <i>Alderman Alverson.</i>
- <i>Nay.</i>

51:48.561 --> 51:51.745
- <i>Alderman Duss.</i>
- <i>Nay.</i>

51:53.063 --> 51:55.736
- <i>Alderman Alfill.</i>
- <i>Nay.</i>

51:57.390 --> 52:00.332
- <i>Alderman de Kuwalski.</i>
- <i>Nay.</i>

52:01.571 --> 52:04.341
- <i>Alderman Johnson.</i>
- <i>Nay.</i>

52:05.140 --> 52:07.743
- <i>Alderman Ortiz.</i>
- <i>Nay.</i>

52:07.887 --> 52:09.189
Out of the way!
Out of the way!

52:10.238 --> 52:11.370
Move!

52:12.478 --> 52:13.585
<i>- Nay.
- Nay.</i>

52:13.711 --> 52:17.889
<i>- Nay. - Nay. - Nay.
- Nay. - Nay. - Nay.</i>

52:18.289 --> 52:20.510
<i>( gavel pounding )</i>

52:20.804 --> 52:25.211
Clerk: <i>With a tally of 41 nays,
this measure is denied.</i>

52:57.307 --> 52:59.622
<i>( people murmuring )</i>

53:17.621 --> 53:18.949
Alan.

53:19.295 --> 53:22.091
Alan, you wanna tell me
what just happened in there?

53:23.801 --> 53:26.401
( scoffs ) Doesn't
really matter much now.

53:26.530 --> 53:28.326
<i>A different deal was made.</i>

53:29.040 --> 53:31.347
McGantry: <i>You're in a
unique position, Mr. Ross.</i>

53:31.473 --> 53:33.658
This bond acquisition vote
provides you an opportunity

53:33.801 --> 53:36.075
to stimulate a wind of change.

53:37.056 --> 53:38.795
Kane's reach extends beyond

53:38.904 --> 53:41.435
my legislative grasp,
Mr. McGantry.

53:41.556 --> 53:43.070
<i>You're an example of that.</i>

53:43.564 --> 53:45.313
He'll find another way.

53:45.449 --> 53:47.163
<i>I'll handle the banks</i>
<i>and lenders.</i>

53:47.280 --> 53:49.421
The well is all
but poisoned already.

53:49.570 --> 53:50.983
For those in the council
who waver,

53:51.099 --> 53:53.059
you might remind them
that their own elections

53:53.176 --> 53:56.386
are likely in need
of financial incentives.

53:58.651 --> 54:02.121
Sacrifice the castle
to take down the king.

54:02.634 --> 54:06.977
Castles can be rebuilt,
men cannot.

54:11.011 --> 54:13.114
He threw money at them,
all of them.

54:13.244 --> 54:16.167
Alverson, Driscoll,
Ortiz-- lots of money.

54:16.279 --> 54:19.482
Idiots, assholes, ungrateful,
shortsighted sons of bitches.

54:20.791 --> 54:22.493
Doyle, now.

54:23.166 --> 54:25.605
Obviously this means
Lennox Gardens--

54:27.898 --> 54:29.419
- <i>Doyle.</i>
- McGantry--

54:29.537 --> 54:30.857
<i>everything you need, you have,</i>

54:30.961 --> 54:32.243
wrapped up in a goddamn bow.

54:32.342 --> 54:33.214
Look, Tom--

54:33.318 --> 54:34.874
<i>I fully expect you to use</i>
<i>what little muscle</i>

54:34.987 --> 54:36.681
you have to lock him up
before I hand

54:36.838 --> 54:38.901
this slam-fuckin'-dunk case
over to the feds.

54:39.021 --> 54:40.683
Or would you rather lose
yet another

54:40.845 --> 54:44.177
- headline-grabbing opportunity?
- <i>( slams receiver )</i>

54:47.166 --> 54:48.850
What do we do?

54:53.750 --> 54:55.606
I don't know.

55:01.684 --> 55:03.064
Sam:
<i>Miss?</i>

55:03.817 --> 55:05.540
Miss, I need to ask you
a few more questions.

55:05.641 --> 55:07.592
- Leave me alone.
- I won't name you as a source.

55:07.711 --> 55:08.989
Just give me some
answers and I'll go.

55:09.100 --> 55:11.452
I didn't call the police
before, but I'm going to now.

55:11.569 --> 55:14.263
Yes or no-- was Tom Kane
admitted to your clinic?

55:14.384 --> 55:16.171
- I said fuck off!
- Hey, look!

55:16.417 --> 55:18.229
I don't want any trouble here,
but you have information

55:18.352 --> 55:21.117
that could be vitally
important to a lot of people.

55:21.760 --> 55:23.390
I'm trying to do
the right thing here.

55:23.510 --> 55:25.078
Kane is a dangerous man,

55:25.444 --> 55:27.900
potentially lethal
if he's sick as well.

55:28.955 --> 55:30.671
I need to know.

55:32.643 --> 55:35.350
- Yes.
- Yes what?

55:37.010 --> 55:38.721
We treated him.

55:39.801 --> 55:42.259
He stayed for two days.

55:42.609 --> 55:44.374
Several brain treatments.

55:45.487 --> 55:47.536
Electroconvulsive therapy
was one of them.

55:47.690 --> 55:49.230
I don't know what else.

55:50.833 --> 55:52.536
Please let me go.

55:53.884 --> 55:55.645
Sorry.
