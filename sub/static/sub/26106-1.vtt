[man] The reason you're sitting
in this room today

00:16.421 --> 00:19.456
is because you want
the knowledge and the confidence

00:19.458 --> 00:21.691
to stand in front
of a team of producers

00:21.693 --> 00:24.427
and convince them
that you are worthy

00:24.429 --> 00:26.663
of the opportunity to act.

00:26.665 --> 00:29.799
If you think that
you are indeed worthy,

00:29.801 --> 00:31.502
you're in the right place.

00:31.504 --> 00:35.273
I mean, this is the epicenter
of opportunity, right?

00:35.275 --> 00:38.408
I-it's right outside that door.

00:38.410 --> 00:40.444
So go get it.

00:40.446 --> 00:42.480
[chuckles] But wait a second.

00:42.482 --> 00:45.615
Comes with a catch,
doesn't it?

00:45.617 --> 00:48.819
It just so happens that acting

00:48.821 --> 00:52.523
is the worst profession
in the world

00:52.525 --> 00:56.593
unless you love it so much

00:56.595 --> 00:59.529
that you're willing
to sacrifice everything.

00:59.531 --> 01:02.733
I'm talking about
full commitment, people.

01:02.735 --> 01:06.436
- [stage bell rings]
- It is an existential act

01:06.438 --> 01:11.374
that defines
every aspect of your life.

01:11.376 --> 01:13.677
There are only
two potential outcomes

01:13.679 --> 01:16.447
for you as an actor.

01:16.449 --> 01:18.816
One, you will succeed.

01:18.818 --> 01:22.653
[woman] Few people know of me.
Even less know...

01:22.655 --> 01:24.722
[man] And you'll live that
glamorous life of limos

01:24.724 --> 01:28.959
and red carpets
and swag and fame

01:28.961 --> 01:31.895
and bringing television
and film to life

01:31.897 --> 01:33.731
through your performance.

01:33.733 --> 01:35.933
Or, two...

01:35.935 --> 01:38.368
you'll quit.

01:38.370 --> 01:39.903
- [tape continues underneath]
- That's right.

01:39.905 --> 01:44.507
the unfortunate reality
is that 99% of you

01:44.509 --> 01:48.611
will leave this town without
accomplishing your goals.

01:48.613 --> 01:51.915
[chuckles softly]
I am not telling you this

01:51.917 --> 01:54.517
to discourage you,
believe me, no, no, no.

01:54.519 --> 01:57.520
[woman] Nothing can stop me.
I am a blackbird.

01:57.522 --> 02:00.457
- Naomi Baker?
- [click]

02:00.459 --> 02:03.993
[man] I'm telling you this
to challenge you,

02:03.995 --> 02:06.629
to go out there
and to hustle.

02:06.631 --> 02:10.668
Defeat this city
before it defeats you!

02:10.669 --> 02:14.038
The real secret
to all of this...

02:14.040 --> 02:15.906
is survival.

02:15.908 --> 02:21.511
Can you outperform and outlast
that person sitting next to you?

02:21.513 --> 02:22.612
Whenever you're ready.

02:22.614 --> 02:24.814
[man]
Are you ready?

02:24.816 --> 02:30.054
Are you ready to win?
Are you?

02:30.056 --> 02:33.059
Well, then, let's get started.

02:35.000 --> 02:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:16.601 --> 03:19.469
So, Terry,
where you from?

03:19.471 --> 03:21.038
Wyoming, sir.

03:21.040 --> 03:22.039
Wyoming?

03:22.041 --> 03:24.474
Yeah, born and raised.

03:24.476 --> 03:26.210
And I suppose you chose
to work out here.

03:26.212 --> 03:29.750
- Who wouldn't wanna work out here?
- [scoffs]

03:31.818 --> 03:34.551
- How long you been a cop?
- Six years.

03:34.553 --> 03:37.221
Oh, wow, probably have
some pretty good stories.

03:37.223 --> 03:39.590
Actually, six years
working in this town

03:39.592 --> 03:41.592
will make you wish
you stayed in Wyoming.

03:41.594 --> 03:43.927
Really?
What makes you say that?

03:43.929 --> 03:46.565
[police radio chatter]

03:50.837 --> 03:53.871
[dance music playing]

03:53.873 --> 03:55.171
See those people?

03:55.173 --> 03:58.908
Now, you may not see
that one thing

03:58.910 --> 04:03.112
is waiting to get them,
whether it be partying,

04:03.114 --> 04:04.515
drugs...

04:04.517 --> 04:07.016
sex.

04:07.018 --> 04:10.022
You stick around long enough,
that one thing will get you.

04:12.225 --> 04:14.894
That's, uh, depressing.

04:18.064 --> 04:21.867
Oh, hey.
What's her story?

04:23.869 --> 04:25.802
She is a cutie.

04:25.804 --> 04:28.775
[indistinct conversations,
dance music continues]

04:43.922 --> 04:46.156
- Excuse me.
- End of the line.

04:46.158 --> 04:49.795
Oh, I'm on the list.
Elsa Montgomery.

04:55.835 --> 04:57.735
All right.

04:57.737 --> 04:59.105
Thanks.

05:11.550 --> 05:14.119
[music volume increases]

05:33.939 --> 05:35.172
Joe!

05:35.174 --> 05:39.009
Oh, my God!
Hi! You made it! Hey!

05:39.011 --> 05:41.312
This place
is absolutely crazy.

05:41.314 --> 05:44.581
Yeah, you came on a slow night.
Naomi, this is Elsa.

05:44.583 --> 05:46.684
Oh, my God, hi.
Nice to meet you.

05:46.686 --> 05:48.718
So you decided
to be an actress?

05:48.720 --> 05:51.822
- Why not give it a shot, right?
- You and everybody else in here.

05:51.824 --> 05:55.225
This calls for a celebration.
Naomi, come here.

05:55.227 --> 05:59.295
- All right, to Elsa...
- And to hell.

05:59.297 --> 06:03.067
[both] May our stay there
be as fun as our way there.

06:03.069 --> 06:05.905
[dance music continues]

07:09.201 --> 07:10.968
[man] Who is it?

07:10.970 --> 07:13.771
[rock music playing]

07:13.773 --> 07:17.143
- [knock on door]
- Just a minute!

07:18.174 --> 07:20.212
[siren wails in distance]

07:24.182 --> 07:25.884
[door unlocks]

07:29.388 --> 07:31.124
I need more.

07:35.393 --> 07:37.364
[knock on door]

07:39.932 --> 07:41.400
[groans softly]

07:52.143 --> 07:53.410
[groans]

07:53.412 --> 07:54.845
Ooh...

07:54.847 --> 07:57.017
- I know that feeling.
- [chuckles]

08:12.898 --> 08:15.999
[man speaking on radio]

08:16.001 --> 08:18.468
[Elsa]
Last night was crazy.

08:18.470 --> 08:20.237
It's probably been
a little while

08:20.239 --> 08:23.339
- since you let your hair down.
- Yeah, you have no idea.

08:23.341 --> 08:24.975
[chuckles]

08:24.977 --> 08:29.011
Mm.
What's that picture all about?

08:29.013 --> 08:33.750
I don't know.
Naomi has a thing for irony.

08:33.751 --> 08:35.418
[man] You want irony?

08:35.419 --> 08:38.288
Mel Blanc,
the voice of Bugs Bunny,

08:38.289 --> 08:41.193
was allergic to carrots,
that's irony.

08:43.761 --> 08:44.927
Enjoy.

08:44.929 --> 08:46.363
Is he being serious?

08:46.365 --> 08:48.499
That would depend
on how you define "serious."

08:48.501 --> 08:50.933
Let me guess,
you're an actor, too?

08:50.935 --> 08:52.235
Absolutely not.

08:52.237 --> 08:54.971
Acting is pain.

08:54.973 --> 08:57.006
[scoffs] You have no idea

08:57.008 --> 08:58.908
what you're getting
yourself into, do you?

08:58.910 --> 09:01.912
- Don't listen to him.
- So what's Naomi story?

09:01.914 --> 09:05.249
She's sweet.
I mean, a tad intense.

09:05.251 --> 09:06.817
Can she act?

09:06.819 --> 09:08.851
Uh, yeah.
She's good.

09:08.853 --> 09:10.486
"Good" does not explain it.

09:10.488 --> 09:12.990
There's a reason why people
call her "the machine."

09:12.992 --> 09:14.557
The machine. Why?

09:14.559 --> 09:16.894
The girl
is a total health nut.

09:16.896 --> 09:19.495
She starts every morning
with a yoga session

09:19.497 --> 09:24.268
to clear her head,
boxing to settle any anxiety.

09:24.270 --> 09:27.203
Then she goes for a jog
while studying her lines

09:27.205 --> 09:29.840
toting this rusty
tape recorder around.

09:29.842 --> 09:32.275
She even makes time to go
and get her palm read.

09:32.277 --> 09:34.878
I mean, the girl cooks
her own vitamins.

09:34.880 --> 09:36.346
Who does that?

09:36.348 --> 09:40.116
She mixes mind, body, cardio,
and superstition

09:40.118 --> 09:42.351
before most people roll out
of bed in the morning.

09:42.353 --> 09:44.955
- Wow.
- Good morning, ladies.

09:44.957 --> 09:47.291
- Children.
- [man] Love you, too.

09:47.293 --> 09:51.028
- Morning.
- So, our new aspiring actress,

09:51.030 --> 09:53.163
how do you pay the bills?
Do you have a job?

09:53.165 --> 09:56.533
Actually, I landed an internship
at the Angel City Reporter.

09:56.535 --> 09:58.235
I figure it wouldn't hurt
to learn

09:58.237 --> 10:00.003
that side of the business,
too, so.

10:00.005 --> 10:02.105
And why the late start,
if you don't mind my asking?

10:02.107 --> 10:03.941
Didn't you and Joe
go to college together?

10:03.943 --> 10:05.341
You mean dropped
out of college together.

10:05.343 --> 10:09.580
We did, life just got
a little complicated.

10:09.582 --> 10:13.917
You could say that Elsa has
faced her share of distractions.

10:13.919 --> 10:15.318
Regardless, I'm here now.

10:15.320 --> 10:19.423
So you two have been acting
for a while now.

10:19.425 --> 10:21.057
Break it down for me.

10:21.059 --> 10:24.561
- Break it down for you?
- Oh, boy, here it comes.

10:24.563 --> 10:27.931
If we knew how to break it down,
we wouldn't be bartending.

10:27.933 --> 10:30.600
[cell phone buzzes]

10:30.602 --> 10:32.903
Anthony? Hey.

10:32.905 --> 10:34.605
Yeah, I'm on pins and needles
over here, any updates?

10:34.607 --> 10:36.472
- It's her agent.
- Oh.

10:36.474 --> 10:38.010
[Naomi] Uh-huh.

10:39.210 --> 10:40.546
Are you shitting me?

10:42.180 --> 10:45.117
Oh, my God.
Thank you.

10:49.255 --> 10:51.388
Well, what is it?

10:51.390 --> 10:53.423
[chuckles]

10:53.425 --> 10:58.394
Numerous species develop through
a process called metamorphosis.

10:58.396 --> 11:02.099
This is a Greek word
that means transformation

11:02.101 --> 11:05.001
or change in form.

11:05.003 --> 11:08.504
And the chrysalis seen here

11:08.506 --> 11:12.442
will soon be
a beautiful butterfly.

11:12.444 --> 11:15.177
Or will it?

11:15.179 --> 11:18.347
Interesting fact, only about 10%
of butterfly chrysalis

11:18.349 --> 11:21.551
actually survive in the wild.

11:21.553 --> 11:26.255
But what I find
even more interesting

11:26.257 --> 11:28.658
is that no one ever talks
about the internal struggle

11:28.660 --> 11:31.595
a caterpillar faces
during this process.

11:31.597 --> 11:35.698
See, the truth is,
a caterpillar never knows

11:35.700 --> 11:40.169
it's going to be a butterfly,
and during the confusion,

11:40.171 --> 11:45.975
during the...
torture inside this chrysalis

11:45.977 --> 11:50.113
it's actually convinced that
its life has come to an end.

11:50.115 --> 11:53.649
But what this little one
doesn't realize

11:53.651 --> 11:57.220
is if it can just
withstand the agony,

11:57.222 --> 12:00.090
if it can overcome
the doubt of this process,

12:00.092 --> 12:02.558
it will achieve its objective,

12:02.560 --> 12:07.333
and it will transform
into a butterfly.

12:09.068 --> 12:13.269
So I say to you,
studious caterpillars...

12:13.271 --> 12:16.005
[light laughter]

12:16.007 --> 12:19.009
Much like in life...

12:19.011 --> 12:22.180
only the persistent
will achieve.

12:24.382 --> 12:26.151
Any questions?

12:28.186 --> 12:32.054
This is a nice surprise.
What's going on?

12:32.056 --> 12:34.593
You looked like you were about
to have a seizure back there.

12:36.027 --> 12:37.296
I got the part.

12:39.530 --> 12:40.663
You... you got the part.

12:40.665 --> 12:42.466
- Yeah.
- You g... no shit!

12:42.468 --> 12:43.700
- No shit! No shit!
- No shit!

12:43.702 --> 12:46.669
- Oh, my... oh, my God!
- [laughs]

12:46.671 --> 12:49.374
- Oh, my God!
- Let's celebrate.

12:51.209 --> 12:52.708
We are you taking me?

12:52.710 --> 12:55.414
Uh, I'm not sure yet.

12:59.584 --> 13:01.717
Oh, my God.

13:01.719 --> 13:04.221
Wow.

13:04.223 --> 13:06.490
Holy shit!

13:06.492 --> 13:07.557
It's beautiful.

13:07.559 --> 13:08.591
No, it's not.

13:08.593 --> 13:10.326
[chuckles]

13:10.328 --> 13:13.031
I've never seen
the sunset like that.

13:15.067 --> 13:16.600
[laughs]

13:16.602 --> 13:19.235
- Yep.
- That's really cute.

13:19.237 --> 13:22.706
Nothing screams "celebration"
more than drinking champagne

13:22.708 --> 13:25.708
- out of plastic cups.
- That's adorable.

13:25.710 --> 13:26.809
- [laughs]
- Cheers.

13:26.811 --> 13:28.246
Cheers.

13:32.718 --> 13:35.418
That... that is really bad.

13:35.420 --> 13:37.220
It's disgusting.

13:37.222 --> 13:40.657
I'm sorry that I don't have
a better champagne for this.

13:40.659 --> 13:42.058
That is fine.

13:42.060 --> 13:43.592
[clears throat]

13:43.594 --> 13:46.229
- Let's make a promise...
- Okay.

13:46.231 --> 13:49.533
That no matter what happens,

13:49.535 --> 13:52.568
we will stay faithful
to each other,

13:52.570 --> 13:56.773
and we will drink shitty
champagne out of plastic cups.

13:56.775 --> 13:59.746
- [laughs] I promise.
- Cheers.

14:03.381 --> 14:05.282
It's not better
the second time.

14:05.284 --> 14:07.283
No.

14:07.285 --> 14:09.388
[both laughs]

14:12.623 --> 14:14.291
It's just crazy.

14:14.293 --> 14:17.094
All the countless
talented people out there

14:17.096 --> 14:19.428
who are chasing
the exact same dream.

14:19.430 --> 14:23.866
Yeah, it is.
But you know what?

14:23.868 --> 14:26.135
You did it.

14:26.137 --> 14:28.173
The chase is over.

14:47.192 --> 14:50.530
[camera clicking,
flash whining]

15:07.411 --> 15:11.684
[man] Death to all!
For we must fall!

15:20.892 --> 15:23.225
[Elsa] All right,
so how do I book a job?

15:23.227 --> 15:24.760
How do you build a resume?

15:24.762 --> 15:26.796
Oh, here is where
the frustration begins.

15:26.798 --> 15:29.499
The process begins and ends
with landing an agent.

15:29.501 --> 15:31.801
- That's the key ingredient.
- [Elsa] All right.

15:31.803 --> 15:34.171
But before you do that,
you have to have a good reel.

15:34.173 --> 15:35.672
Okay, how do I do that?

15:35.674 --> 15:38.774
You know, student films,
indies, anything, really.

15:38.776 --> 15:41.778
Success doesn't mean happiness.
Happiness means success.

15:41.780 --> 15:43.613
But before you can do
any of that,

15:43.615 --> 15:45.215
you have to have your SAG card
because most agents

15:45.217 --> 15:46.549
won't consider you
without one.

15:46.551 --> 15:48.918
Okay,
so how do I get a SAG card?

15:48.920 --> 15:52.489
By booking a legitimate SAG gig,
a commercial or something.

15:52.491 --> 15:55.192
Sam, so great to see you.

15:55.194 --> 15:56.927
Maggie, I hate you.

15:56.929 --> 15:59.328
Remember, technically,
you can't book any of those

15:59.330 --> 16:01.565
without actually having
your SAG card already.

16:01.567 --> 16:04.737
She's right, but you do all that
and you got yourself a shot.

16:05.904 --> 16:08.772
- You confused yet?
- Totally.

16:08.774 --> 16:10.673
Okay, let me simplify it
for you.

16:10.675 --> 16:13.777
If you don't have a reel,
you'll never get an agent.

16:13.779 --> 16:16.446
Without an agent,
you can't book any gigs.

16:16.448 --> 16:17.980
If you never book a gig,

16:17.982 --> 16:19.749
you won't ever get
your SAG card.

16:19.751 --> 16:22.284
No SAG card
means no SAG jobs,

16:22.286 --> 16:25.322
and no SAG jobs means you'll
never have a decent resume.

16:25.324 --> 16:27.957
- [Elsa] Back to square one.
- [Joe] Back to square one.

16:27.959 --> 16:31.760
So I can't actually
accomplish anything

16:31.762 --> 16:33.830
without already
being accomplished?

16:33.832 --> 16:35.432
There's the rub.

16:35.434 --> 16:37.234
The actor's Catch-22.

16:37.236 --> 16:39.802
And nobody walks into town
and just starts booking.

16:39.804 --> 16:42.471
- So prepare to be humbled.
- And don't stop networking,

16:42.473 --> 16:43.940
or else you'll end up
like that.

16:43.942 --> 16:46.543
[Elsa] Yeah, what's his deal,
by the way?

16:46.545 --> 16:49.946
- Don't even get me started.
- Okay, you guys, come on.

16:49.948 --> 16:51.715
Damien has a heart of gold.

16:51.717 --> 16:53.616
If you knew what he'd been
through in life,

16:53.618 --> 16:56.820
- you'd be more sympathetic.
- He sounds like a rescued dog.

16:56.822 --> 17:00.624
Elsa,
you don't even know him.

17:00.626 --> 17:03.793
And plus, you guys, technically,
we're not even a couple.

17:03.795 --> 17:05.493
Oh, well,
if you're not a couple,

17:05.496 --> 17:07.596
then you won't mind
if I set you up with someone.

17:07.598 --> 17:10.770
- Ooh, now there's an idea.
- I'm not interested.

17:14.539 --> 17:17.210
- [laughs]
- [Damien] Really?

17:19.042 --> 17:21.877
[line rings]

17:21.878 --> 17:24.445
[woman] Joe?
Can you hear us?

17:24.448 --> 17:26.316
[chuckles]
Yeah, hi, I'm here.

17:26.318 --> 17:28.416
Give me an update.
How are you?

17:28.419 --> 17:30.019
Did you get that pilot
you read for?

17:30.021 --> 17:33.056
Uh, no, mom,
I really told you,

17:33.058 --> 17:34.557
that was like two months ago.

17:34.559 --> 17:37.527
So... nothing then?

17:37.529 --> 17:41.865
Uh, nothing yet.
But, um, I am doing really well.

17:41.867 --> 17:44.534
I have two really big
auditions this week,

17:44.536 --> 17:46.036
so cross your fingers.

17:46.038 --> 17:48.305
She should try and get
on one of those soap operas.

17:48.307 --> 17:50.906
[gasps] Yeah.
Yeah, go get one of those.

17:50.908 --> 17:54.076
Oh, oh, oh, your father
and I saw that...

17:54.078 --> 17:56.712
that bank robbery movie
with that young actress.

17:56.714 --> 17:58.981
You're much prettier
than that girl.

17:58.983 --> 18:00.950
You should've been
in that movie.

18:00.952 --> 18:03.053
Well, uh...

18:03.055 --> 18:05.454
like I said,
things are great.

18:05.456 --> 18:08.791
I gotta go, okay?
I love you guys.

18:08.793 --> 18:10.993
Keep us posted.
We send our love.

18:10.995 --> 18:12.497
We love you, honey.

18:15.701 --> 18:16.732
[singsong] Bullshit.

18:16.734 --> 18:19.938
God. [sighs]

18:32.951 --> 18:35.054
- Oh, shit.
- [Damien chuckles]

18:37.521 --> 18:38.991
[softly] Shit.

18:46.030 --> 18:48.131
That was fun today.

18:48.133 --> 18:51.470
Yeah, it was.

18:52.738 --> 18:55.003
We could do that more often.

18:55.005 --> 18:57.375
Okay, let's do it.

18:58.577 --> 19:00.479
[Joe] Like,
just the two of us.

19:03.447 --> 19:05.684
Consistently.

19:10.989 --> 19:12.792
Never mind.

19:15.827 --> 19:18.394
No, actually,
I do want a response from you.

19:18.396 --> 19:19.729
What are we doing?

19:19.731 --> 19:21.964
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

19:21.966 --> 19:25.470
No, I don't.
That's why am asking you.

19:27.105 --> 19:29.905
I feel like we have
something special here,

19:29.907 --> 19:32.642
and I want to know
if you feel it, too.

19:32.644 --> 19:35.545
[chuckles]
Let's just agree to have our fun

19:35.547 --> 19:38.784
until it's not fun anymore,
okay?

19:40.152 --> 19:43.655
Do you have any idea
how cold that sounds?

19:45.757 --> 19:47.524
Are you even listening
to me?

19:47.526 --> 19:49.625
I'm trying to tell you
that I care about you.

19:49.627 --> 19:51.094
And I'm trying to spare you.

19:51.096 --> 19:54.867
Spare me? From what?
I have nothing going on.

19:56.167 --> 19:57.866
I've even thought
about taking a break

19:57.868 --> 19:59.838
from acting
for a little while.

20:05.543 --> 20:07.009
[Joe]
What are you doing?

20:07.011 --> 20:09.479
Get out.

20:09.481 --> 20:11.980
[Joe] Excuse me?

20:11.982 --> 20:13.982
Get out of the car, Joe.

20:13.984 --> 20:16.986
Get the fuck out of the car.

20:16.988 --> 20:19.091
Are you serious?

20:25.730 --> 20:27.031
Fine.

21:09.273 --> 21:11.941
[vomits]

21:11.943 --> 21:14.078
[coughing]

21:32.030 --> 21:33.962
[man] Where the hell
have you been?

21:33.964 --> 21:35.597
You booked the gig
of a lifetime,

21:35.599 --> 21:36.833
you decide to show up late?

21:36.835 --> 21:38.902
I was feeling
a little sick, okay?

21:38.904 --> 21:40.135
You're nervous.

21:40.137 --> 21:42.271
Anthony, relax,
I'm not nervous.

21:42.273 --> 21:44.843
[woman]
He'll see you now.

21:48.946 --> 21:51.280
- [man] There she is.
- Hello.

21:51.282 --> 21:54.182
Congratulations, Naomi.
Please, have a seat.

21:54.184 --> 21:57.921
[Naomi] Thank you so much
for this opportunity.

21:57.923 --> 21:59.689
It was a slam dunk.

21:59.691 --> 22:03.226
No one came off as prepared
and confident as you did.

22:03.228 --> 22:05.094
And I knew I needed
someone special,

22:05.096 --> 22:07.262
someone...
someone different.

22:07.264 --> 22:09.065
That means so much
coming from you.

22:09.067 --> 22:11.601
There's still a few details
to iron out with the studio,

22:11.603 --> 22:13.635
but we're looking to start
production right away.

22:13.637 --> 22:16.673
So, um... what do you say?

22:16.675 --> 22:18.240
You ready to make a movie?

22:18.242 --> 22:21.179
Yes, sir. I'm ready.

22:38.363 --> 22:39.996
[Naomi]
I chose this existence.

22:39.998 --> 22:41.897
And the quest
I'm about to embark on

22:41.899 --> 22:43.633
cannot be explained.

22:43.635 --> 22:47.069
Nothing can stop me.
I am the blackbird.

22:47.071 --> 22:50.275
But will I choose good
in this world full of evil?

22:52.344 --> 22:54.711
Can I forget the past
that has tortured me

22:54.713 --> 22:57.249
and made me what I am today?

22:59.283 --> 23:01.617
If it was a hero
you were looking for,

23:01.619 --> 23:04.822
- you may want to keep looking.
- [recorder clicks]

23:06.691 --> 23:08.357
[woman]
Don't forget to breathe.

23:08.359 --> 23:10.660
[Naomi] I'm sure you have
a million questions

23:10.662 --> 23:12.961
running through your head.

23:12.963 --> 23:15.867
I wish there
were something we could do.

23:17.801 --> 23:19.902
I wish it were easier.

23:19.904 --> 23:22.939
I should tell you the task
we were given

23:22.941 --> 23:26.078
was decided some time ago,
and it now involves you.

23:27.678 --> 23:30.181
We were sent to save a Savior.

23:31.415 --> 23:33.149
[woman]
Let's see that hand of yours.

23:33.151 --> 23:36.019
Mm.

23:36.021 --> 23:38.354
If you look deeply into
the palm of your hand,

23:38.356 --> 23:41.057
you'll see the generations
of your ancestors,

23:41.059 --> 23:44.661
and all of them are alive
in this moment.

23:44.663 --> 23:47.262
Each is present
in your body.

23:47.264 --> 23:53.269
You are the continuation
of each of these people.

23:53.271 --> 23:55.070
Something wrong?

23:55.072 --> 23:57.740
No.
Nothing's wrong, actually.

23:57.742 --> 24:00.710
Um... an opportunity's
come to me.

24:00.712 --> 24:02.345
I thought I saw
something different.

24:02.347 --> 24:07.150
Gimme that.
Ah, yes.

24:07.152 --> 24:09.218
Your outlook indeed
looks more favorable.

24:09.220 --> 24:11.019
I can see that right here.

24:11.021 --> 24:14.893
If I may ask, how come
you couldn't see that before?

24:20.130 --> 24:23.165
- What's your name again?
- Naomi.

24:23.167 --> 24:26.169
Does the sign on my window
say "fortune teller"?

24:26.171 --> 24:30.239
People in my profession
deal with a person's past,

24:30.241 --> 24:32.275
their personality,
their experiences.

24:32.277 --> 24:33.776
[stammers] Yeah, I get that.

24:33.778 --> 24:35.377
I'm sorry if I came off
a little rude.

24:35.379 --> 24:40.115
You were disrespectful.
You're here for answers, right?

24:40.117 --> 24:43.885
- Yeah, I am.
- So if you question my conclusions,

24:43.887 --> 24:45.357
perhaps you shouldn't ask.

24:47.826 --> 24:50.093
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right.

24:50.095 --> 24:53.395
I'll...
I'll see you next time.

24:53.397 --> 24:55.833
[shower running]

25:06.310 --> 25:08.443
[Elsa]
How do you do it, Naomi?

25:08.445 --> 25:12.381
This is my first audition,
and I am a nervous wreck.

25:12.383 --> 25:14.416
[Naomi on phone]
Just remember to breathe,

25:14.418 --> 25:16.919
be yourself, own the room,
and call me after.

25:16.921 --> 25:18.320
I want to hear all about it.

25:18.322 --> 25:21.891
I will if I can avoid
having a panic attack.

25:21.893 --> 25:24.493
And thanks for setting me up
with your old commercial agent.

25:24.495 --> 25:27.829
I wouldn't have this opportunity
if it weren't for your help.

25:27.831 --> 25:30.432
My pleasure.
Now go break a leg.

25:30.434 --> 25:33.301
- Thanks, bye.
- Bye!

25:33.303 --> 25:35.239
[line disconnects]

25:59.496 --> 26:01.899
[woman] That's good,
sell that mouthwash.

26:03.801 --> 26:05.503
And gargle.

26:07.105 --> 26:10.105
Spit. Great.

26:10.107 --> 26:14.242
Okay, now can you give us
a big smile?

26:14.244 --> 26:16.244
Great, awesome.
That was good.

26:16.246 --> 26:20.016
Now can you do it with
a little more... excitement?

26:20.018 --> 26:22.518
- [gargles]
- Spit.

26:22.520 --> 26:25.555
- [spits]
- Okay, give us a big smile.

26:25.557 --> 26:30.026
That was good.
Okay, that's it, thanks.

26:30.028 --> 26:31.463
Next.

26:34.398 --> 26:35.900
[sighs]

26:44.274 --> 26:46.342
[Naomi on phone]
Okay, so how'd it go?

26:46.344 --> 26:49.045
[sighs] I have no idea.

26:49.047 --> 26:51.314
I feel completely unsure
about it.

26:51.316 --> 26:53.149
Honestly,
you'll drive yourself crazy

26:53.151 --> 26:54.983
if you're sitting around
waiting for a phone call,

26:54.985 --> 26:57.486
so I would say
just forget about it

26:57.488 --> 26:59.154
and move onto the next thing.

26:59.156 --> 27:02.024
Can I ask you something?

27:02.026 --> 27:03.960
Sure.

27:03.962 --> 27:06.194
I know it's been a while
since I've been around Joe,

27:06.196 --> 27:09.632
but have you known her
to do any drugs?

27:09.634 --> 27:12.234
Nothing too crazy.
Why do you ask?

27:12.236 --> 27:13.635
I found something.

27:13.637 --> 27:15.637
I mean, I've seen
some heavy stuff before,

27:15.639 --> 27:18.039
but I've never seen
anything like this.

27:18.041 --> 27:21.245
Okay, um, so what are we
gonna do about it?

27:22.946 --> 27:26.249
I think it's time
I found Joe a distraction.

27:26.251 --> 27:29.120
[light music playing
on speakers]

27:51.509 --> 27:53.178
Hmm.

28:04.989 --> 28:07.025
[cell phone rings]

28:12.664 --> 28:16.031
This is Elsa.

28:16.033 --> 28:17.535
Mm-hmm.

28:19.303 --> 28:20.973
Yeah?

28:24.242 --> 28:26.511
[softly] Oh, my God.

28:29.547 --> 28:31.579
Can I have a bloody Mary,
please?

28:31.581 --> 28:34.349
- Sure, no problem.
- Thank you.

28:34.351 --> 28:36.254
You okay?

28:37.722 --> 28:39.454
Yeah. Fine.

28:39.456 --> 28:42.024
'Cause you know you can talk
to me about anything.

28:42.026 --> 28:43.491
You know that, right?

28:43.493 --> 28:46.130
Yeah. I know.

28:48.265 --> 28:51.067
Oh, my God, you guys.
I've got a lot going on here.

28:51.069 --> 28:53.736
- I need your full attention.
- Okay.

28:53.738 --> 28:56.471
Apparently,
I just booked the commercial.

28:56.473 --> 28:59.275
Oh, my God.
Congratulations.

28:59.277 --> 29:01.676
Thanks! I can't believe it.
My agent called and everything.

29:01.678 --> 29:04.181
- Elsa, that's fantastic.
- That's...

29:05.716 --> 29:07.516
I'm really happy for you,
Elsa.

29:07.518 --> 29:10.152
[Elsa] Oh, my God,
it's all happening so fast!

29:10.154 --> 29:13.021
I have no idea what to expect.
I am so nervous.

29:13.023 --> 29:16.025
Elsa, did you have another
announcement to make?

29:16.027 --> 29:18.594
Yeah, yes, I do.

29:18.596 --> 29:20.229
[clears throat]

29:20.231 --> 29:23.365
[sighs] I hope you like
Mexican food, young lady,

29:23.367 --> 29:25.671
because I found you
a date for tonight.

29:27.137 --> 29:29.471
- Me?
- Yes, you.

29:29.473 --> 29:32.143
Elsa, why would you...
I didn't ask you

29:33.174 --> 29:35.211
- to set me up with anybody.
- Come on. Just entertain me.

29:35.213 --> 29:38.047
Do something different.
Be spontaneous.

29:38.049 --> 29:39.952
Maybe even get laid.

29:41.418 --> 29:44.386
Oh, come on, Joe, it'll be fun.

29:44.388 --> 29:46.087
For all of us.

29:46.089 --> 29:49.392
[laughs]

29:49.394 --> 29:51.160
I hate you.

29:51.162 --> 29:53.699
[Mexican folk music playing]

29:56.267 --> 30:00.205
[indistinct conversations,
food sizzling]

30:09.680 --> 30:11.750
[toilet flushes]

30:34.539 --> 30:37.506
So fucking stupid.

30:37.508 --> 30:40.442
Randy?

30:40.444 --> 30:41.509
Joe?

30:41.511 --> 30:42.811
- Um...
- Yeah.

30:42.813 --> 30:45.780
Wow. You look great.

30:45.782 --> 30:49.684
Um, this whole, like,
online dating thing

30:49.686 --> 30:51.353
is totally new to me.

30:51.355 --> 30:53.489
Me, too. First time.

30:53.491 --> 30:56.558
Yeah.
Let's get a waiter over here.

30:56.560 --> 30:58.794
Maybe some alcohol
might loosen us up.

30:58.796 --> 31:03.632
- Actually, I don't drink.
- [men arguing in background]

31:03.634 --> 31:05.101
Right.

31:05.103 --> 31:06.568
- [cell phone chirps]
- Oh!

31:06.570 --> 31:08.104
Oh, boy.

31:08.106 --> 31:11.339
Oh, I think we stumbled
out of the gate.

31:11.341 --> 31:13.608
- Mm-hmm. [laughs]
- Poor Joe.

31:13.610 --> 31:15.111
[both chuckle]

31:15.113 --> 31:17.680
- [vibrates]
- [Randy] Everything okay?

31:17.682 --> 31:19.848
Um, yeah, sorry.

31:19.850 --> 31:24.119
So you like being a cop?

31:24.121 --> 31:26.122
- I do.
- [argument continuing]

31:26.124 --> 31:28.124
You like being an actress?

31:28.126 --> 31:29.391
Mm, not yet.

31:29.393 --> 31:31.292
[man] You called
my parole officer?!

31:31.294 --> 31:32.862
You had to call
my fucking parole officer.

31:32.864 --> 31:35.396
Where did you find
this place?

31:35.398 --> 31:37.465
I know it's a little bit
off the beaten path,

31:37.467 --> 31:39.768
but trust me,
but wait till you try the food.

31:39.770 --> 31:41.303
It's amazing.

31:41.305 --> 31:44.140
I'll have a margarita, please,
no salt.

31:44.142 --> 31:46.241
I'm fine, thanks.

31:46.243 --> 31:47.910
- Uh, extra strong.
- [man] I've been here two years!

31:47.912 --> 31:49.244
- Please.
- [man] This is bullshit!

31:49.246 --> 31:50.913
Two fucking years!

31:50.915 --> 31:53.582
So... what's your story?

31:53.584 --> 31:57.586
Why don't we start with you?
Have you ever been married?

31:57.588 --> 32:00.288
Almost.

32:00.290 --> 32:01.789
Do you have kids?

32:01.791 --> 32:02.790
No kids.

32:02.792 --> 32:06.362
Who is your favorite actor?

32:06.364 --> 32:08.797
- Uh...
- [cell phone chimes]

32:08.799 --> 32:11.767
Oh, Vin Diesel.
Crash and burn.

32:11.769 --> 32:14.537
Damn it! [laughs]

32:14.539 --> 32:17.673
- [vibrates]
- [Randy] Are you sure everything's okay?

32:17.675 --> 32:20.276
Um... sorry.

32:20.278 --> 32:21.576
[argument continuing]

32:21.578 --> 32:24.346
Look,
I don't want to upset you,

32:24.348 --> 32:27.615
but this whole thing was really
sort of a big mistake.

32:27.617 --> 32:28.851
I think it might be better
if we just...

32:28.853 --> 32:30.451
- [man] Fuck this!
- [gunshots]

32:30.453 --> 32:32.654
- That's right, motherfucker!
- [gunshot]

32:32.656 --> 32:35.924
- Everybody get the fuck down!
- Do not get up for any reason.

32:35.926 --> 32:40.261
I want everyone to see this.
I'm going to teach you a lesson.

32:40.263 --> 32:42.631
- I wouldn't do that.
- What... fuck!

32:42.633 --> 32:46.335
- Back the fuck up.
- You kill him, you die.

32:46.337 --> 32:48.971
- The fuck are you, a cop?
- Why are you doing this?

32:48.973 --> 32:52.208
This motherfucker
called my parole officer.

32:52.210 --> 32:54.876
Told him I was stealing.
I didn't do shit!

32:54.878 --> 32:56.912
[Randy] If you didn't do anything,
then we can work this out.

32:56.914 --> 33:00.615
- Put the gun down.
- No, man. I gotta end this.

33:00.617 --> 33:03.384
- What's your name?
- Man, back the fuck up!

33:03.386 --> 33:04.819
What did you get
a bronze star for?

33:04.821 --> 33:07.455
- What'd you say?
- The bronze star on your arm.

33:07.457 --> 33:10.526
You're a Marine, right?
So you're a hero?

33:10.528 --> 33:12.560
Man, what the fuck
do you care?

33:12.562 --> 33:14.630
I'm putting my gun down,
all right?

33:14.632 --> 33:19.567
Because I'm not cool pointing
my gun at a vet, okay?

33:19.569 --> 33:21.670
You're fucking stupid,
you know that?

33:21.672 --> 33:26.008
Maybe, but I ain't killing
nobody today.

33:26.010 --> 33:27.710
And you aren't either.

33:27.712 --> 33:29.778
- [women scream]
- [woman] Oh, my God.

33:29.780 --> 33:32.347
- [siren wailing in distance]
- You hear that?

33:32.349 --> 33:35.351
I'd say you got about 30 seconds
before you have a real problem.

33:35.353 --> 33:36.919
Let him go.

33:36.921 --> 33:39.224
[sirens approaching]

33:41.925 --> 33:44.361
There's the door.

33:54.605 --> 33:58.210
- [woman] Oh, my God!
- [customers murmuring]

34:05.415 --> 34:07.251
You okay?

34:08.985 --> 34:11.553
- [cork pops]
- Whoa!

34:11.554 --> 34:14.656
- [laughs]
- That was a good one.

34:14.658 --> 34:17.324
[sighs] This is crazy.

34:17.327 --> 34:19.761
So I don't know,
what you think?

34:19.763 --> 34:22.531
I mean, he's, like,
kind of a square,

34:22.533 --> 34:24.466
but sort of cute, right?

34:24.467 --> 34:28.303
Yeah, I think that Elsa
may have found you a winner.

34:28.304 --> 34:31.072
[laughs] Fingers crossed.

34:31.074 --> 34:32.841
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

34:32.842 --> 34:34.976
Local police say
the former employee...

34:34.978 --> 34:36.444
Shh! Here it is!

34:36.446 --> 34:38.013
Please, guys.

34:38.014 --> 34:39.982
- This is unnecessary.
- Shh.

34:39.984 --> 34:41.882
And fired three shots
after what appears to have been

34:41.885 --> 34:43.451
a heated exchange of words

34:43.453 --> 34:45.321
with his former management
and staff.

34:45.322 --> 34:49.891
However, one of our own
LAPD officers, Randy Dodge...

34:49.893 --> 34:50.993
- There he is!
- Yay!

34:50.995 --> 34:52.592
Stop, please.

34:52.594 --> 34:55.429
The police officer
came out of nowhere.

34:55.431 --> 34:57.433
He saved us.

34:57.435 --> 34:59.834
I wouldn't be standing here
of it wasn't for that man.

34:59.836 --> 35:02.604
Officer Dodge,
a veteran of the LAPD

35:02.606 --> 35:05.640
for over six years,
he truly embodies the maxim

35:05.642 --> 35:07.609
- "to serve and protect."
- [all cheer]

35:07.611 --> 35:10.379
- Stop, enough. I'm blushing.
- [cell phone buzzing]

35:10.381 --> 35:13.515
This has been Samantha Vista,
Channel 8 News.

35:13.517 --> 35:15.049
Hey, Anthony, can you hear me?

35:15.051 --> 35:17.386
So, Randy,
this is a great icebreaker.

35:17.388 --> 35:19.821
You just set this up for
every date you go on or what?

35:19.823 --> 35:22.758
- Just the best ones, okay?
- Oh, okay.

35:22.760 --> 35:26.028
[Anthony] It's not confirmed yet.
I don't want you to panic.

35:26.030 --> 35:29.365
The studio may decide to change
directors for Blackbird.

35:29.367 --> 35:31.366
A new director?
What does that mean?

35:31.368 --> 35:33.872
This type of thing happens
all the time, all right?

35:38.908 --> 35:41.442
Does that mean
that I've lost the part?

35:41.444 --> 35:44.078
[Anthony] I can't say yet.
Time will tell.

35:44.080 --> 35:47.051
What do you mean you can't say?
You're my agent, Anthony.

35:51.988 --> 35:53.756
Do you at least know
who the new director is?

35:53.758 --> 35:57.859
Naomi, look, slow down,
nothing is confirmed yet.

35:57.861 --> 35:59.794
I just didn't want
any news you hear

35:59.796 --> 36:01.897
to be a surprise to you,
okay?

36:01.899 --> 36:04.133
We'll know more
about this tomorrow.

36:04.135 --> 36:05.837
Keep your chin up.

36:12.709 --> 36:15.579
[sirens wailing in distance]

36:20.151 --> 36:23.053
[rock music playing
through door]

36:28.725 --> 36:30.595
I can see you.

36:47.944 --> 36:50.178
[line rings, beep]

36:50.180 --> 36:54.952
Hi, this is Anthony,
please leave a message. [beep]

36:58.022 --> 36:59.488
[Randy]
How you feeling?

36:59.490 --> 37:02.723
Uh, good, yeah.

37:02.725 --> 37:04.692
How about you?

37:04.694 --> 37:06.962
I haven't felt this good
in a long time.

37:06.964 --> 37:08.863
Good.

37:08.865 --> 37:12.603
[both chuckle]

37:24.080 --> 37:26.982
[knock on door]

37:26.984 --> 37:29.584
Oh, my God.

37:29.586 --> 37:33.955
Hi. Whose car
is that in the driveway?

37:33.957 --> 37:37.125
Uh...

37:37.127 --> 37:38.593
Something wrong?

37:38.595 --> 37:40.229
It's not a good time.

37:40.231 --> 37:41.863
Not a good time?
What are you talking about?

37:41.865 --> 37:45.234
- Damien, please, stop.
- I got this.

37:45.236 --> 37:48.604
Good morning, everyone!
What a fine morning.

37:48.606 --> 37:50.272
Sun's out.
Birds are chirping.

37:50.274 --> 37:53.812
And I spoke too soon.

37:56.580 --> 37:58.247
We have a stranger
in our kitchen.

37:58.249 --> 38:00.214
This is not your kitchen,
Damien.

38:00.216 --> 38:04.218
Elsa, could I bother you
for some coffee?

38:04.220 --> 38:06.187
Damien. And you are?

38:06.189 --> 38:07.221
Randy.

38:07.223 --> 38:08.823
Damien, we should talk.

38:08.825 --> 38:11.826
Thank you, Elsa.

38:11.828 --> 38:15.196
Out of curiosity, Randy,
what do you do for employment?

38:15.198 --> 38:17.566
- Are you an actor?
- Damien, stop.

38:17.568 --> 38:19.700
Actually,
I'm a police officer.

38:19.702 --> 38:21.169
Really?

38:21.171 --> 38:24.305
Now, Elsa, forget the picture.

38:24.307 --> 38:26.607
That is irony.

38:26.609 --> 38:30.044
Joe and a police officer.

38:30.046 --> 38:32.015
Really?

38:34.584 --> 38:38.620
This whole cop gig,
it lands you the ladies, right?

38:38.622 --> 38:40.622
Not really.

38:40.624 --> 38:42.658
What type of gun
do you carry?

38:42.660 --> 38:43.959
.45.

38:43.961 --> 38:46.194
You ever shoot anyone?

38:46.196 --> 38:48.095
Not yet.

38:48.097 --> 38:50.765
- You a homosexual?
- Okay, enough.

38:50.767 --> 38:54.169
It's a fair question.
Check out his haircut.

38:54.171 --> 38:57.205
Let me get this straight.
You're not a womanizer.

38:57.207 --> 39:00.241
You're not gay.
So what's your story, Randy?

39:00.243 --> 39:02.076
Why you become a cop?

39:02.078 --> 39:04.645
I think we've heard enough,
so why don't you just shut up?

39:04.647 --> 39:07.249
[Randy] No, no, it's okay,
I can answer his question.

39:07.251 --> 39:10.555
I had a fiancée.

39:11.988 --> 39:15.991
I had taken her
to dinner downtown.

39:15.993 --> 39:17.892
We were coming back
that evening,

39:17.894 --> 39:20.328
and a few men drove by
and opened fire

39:20.330 --> 39:21.964
on the parking lot.

39:21.966 --> 39:24.600
She was hit by a bullet.

39:24.602 --> 39:28.937
Bounced right off the concrete.
She died in my arms.

39:28.939 --> 39:33.008
Turns out the drive by
was drug-related.

39:33.010 --> 39:35.310
The police never found
the gunman.

39:35.312 --> 39:40.281
I spent two years
of my life

39:40.283 --> 39:42.216
searching for closure.

39:42.218 --> 39:46.388
The cops never lifted
a finger to help.

39:46.390 --> 39:48.924
So...

39:48.926 --> 39:52.127
I became a cop.

39:52.129 --> 39:55.066
Does that answer
your question?

40:02.906 --> 40:05.006
I should, uh...
I should be going.

40:05.008 --> 40:08.679
Thank you for the coffee,
Elsa.

40:12.716 --> 40:14.586
Guess our fun is over.

40:15.952 --> 40:17.321
Hey, Damien.

40:22.926 --> 40:24.828
What's his deal?

40:26.930 --> 40:31.133
Oh.
That's... awkward.

40:31.135 --> 40:34.269
- I'm really sorry.
- No reason to apologize.

40:34.271 --> 40:37.104
It's probably best
I get going, too.

40:37.106 --> 40:39.610
I gotta work.

40:44.080 --> 40:48.015
Thank you all.
I had a great time.

40:48.017 --> 40:51.153
So, um,
I'll call you, or...

40:51.155 --> 40:52.689
I'd like that.

40:57.827 --> 40:59.727
By the way,

40:59.729 --> 41:02.196
I found out
some information this morning.

41:02.198 --> 41:04.299
Ooh, did you?

41:04.301 --> 41:07.839
Yeah, um... Brandon Banks.

41:09.439 --> 41:11.906
Brandon Banks.
What about Brandon Banks?

41:11.908 --> 41:14.475
- Brandon Banks the filmmaker...
- Uh-huh.

41:14.477 --> 41:17.178
he's the new director
on Blackbird.

41:17.180 --> 41:19.281
- Is he really?
- Yeah.

41:19.283 --> 41:21.082
Oh, shit.

41:21.084 --> 41:26.455
[cell phone rings]

41:26.457 --> 41:28.857
Hey, Naomi, I was just gonna
give you a call.

41:28.859 --> 41:31.026
- [Naomi] Brandon Banks.
- Yeah, I know, slow down, okay?

41:31.028 --> 41:32.259
I just found out myself.

41:32.261 --> 41:34.428
Yeah, well,
get him on the phone.

41:34.430 --> 41:36.497
I told you, these things happen
from time to time.

41:36.499 --> 41:38.335
Anthony,
would you just call him?

41:40.069 --> 41:43.839
Oh, wait, you've already
spoken to him, haven't you?

41:43.841 --> 41:45.272
Actually, I have.

41:45.274 --> 41:47.508
And he doesn't see me
in his plans, right?

41:47.510 --> 41:49.511
Would you just wait
a second, okay?

41:49.513 --> 41:52.013
He did say
that he saw your tape

41:52.015 --> 41:54.783
and he thinks that you are
a major talent, all right?

41:54.785 --> 41:56.283
It's just that Banks comes

41:56.285 --> 41:58.153
as part of the package
from the studio,

41:58.155 --> 41:59.988
There's nothing anyone
can do about it.

41:59.990 --> 42:01.756
You sound like you have
no fight left in you.

42:01.758 --> 42:03.991
You think I didn't want
this gig, are you kidding me?

42:03.993 --> 42:06.495
Okay, we got unlucky.
So what?

42:06.497 --> 42:08.830
Now, you got some good exposure
out of this.

42:08.832 --> 42:11.133
What we want to do
is keep the momentum,

42:11.135 --> 42:14.169
turn this into something else
for both of us, all right?

42:14.171 --> 42:15.803
I've waited too long for this.

42:15.805 --> 42:17.339
I'm getting Blackbird,
Anthony,

42:17.341 --> 42:19.207
even if it means
I have to get it by myself.

42:19.209 --> 42:21.011
- Naomi, wait.
- [click]

42:26.482 --> 42:29.517
[Naomi] Brandon Banks,
mystery man.

42:29.519 --> 42:32.921
I'm off to work.

42:32.923 --> 42:34.455
Go get 'em, babe.

42:34.457 --> 42:37.558
Okay,
so how do I find this guy?

42:37.560 --> 42:39.528
[Elsa]
This feels a little obsessive.

42:39.530 --> 42:41.962
[Joe] Els, an actor could live
three lifetimes

42:41.964 --> 42:44.799
and never even sniff at landing
a potential blockbuster.

42:44.801 --> 42:46.267
This was her Titanic,

42:46.269 --> 42:48.136
and Naomi
just hit an iceberg.

42:48.138 --> 42:51.372
No, I totally get that,
but didn't you guys tell me

42:51.374 --> 42:53.174
we should get used
to hearing the word "no"?

42:53.176 --> 42:56.845
Oh, wait, actually,
you can help me with something.

42:56.847 --> 42:58.145
Me.

42:58.147 --> 43:01.216
Yeah, I need you
to make a phone call.

43:01.218 --> 43:03.852
I don't understand.
Who am I calling?

43:03.854 --> 43:07.859
All right, buddy,
we're coming for you.

43:33.316 --> 43:35.417
So drinks are confirmed
with Jonathan,

43:35.419 --> 43:38.220
and you have a 4:00
at the studio with Becky,

43:38.222 --> 43:40.455
auditions are at noon.

43:40.457 --> 43:43.892
Oh, and the Angel City Reporter
called requesting an interview.

43:43.894 --> 43:46.861
It's on the way.
But I can cancel it.

43:46.863 --> 43:48.330
Oh, no.

43:48.332 --> 43:50.432
Don't cancel that.
Press is good.

43:50.434 --> 43:52.901
We need more press.
We want to get it out there.

43:52.903 --> 43:55.102
Okay.

43:55.104 --> 43:57.571
And back.

43:57.573 --> 44:00.575
And get Larry on the phone.
Now.

44:00.577 --> 44:02.180
Okay.

44:03.946 --> 44:05.913
[Brandon] I'm not disagreeing
with you, Larry,

44:05.915 --> 44:07.448
I just have a different vision
for the film.

44:07.450 --> 44:09.183
They brought me on
'cause they think

44:09.185 --> 44:11.586
the franchise has legs,
and they want box office!

44:11.588 --> 44:13.421
[Larry] Let's at least
consider the options

44:13.423 --> 44:15.290
that are already presented
to us.

44:15.292 --> 44:18.593
I'm not going along with
someone else's vision or style.

44:18.595 --> 44:21.062
That would make me a pussy!
I'm not a pussy!

44:21.064 --> 44:23.665
I understand.
I completely get that, Brandon.

44:23.667 --> 44:28.669
Blackbird needs a proven star.
Period. End of conversation.

44:28.671 --> 44:31.305
It's your film.
It's your decision.

44:31.307 --> 44:34.475
Look, making movies
isn't all warm and fuzzy.

44:34.477 --> 44:36.580
Open the God damn gate!

44:48.258 --> 44:50.292
Mr. Banks,
what can I get for you today?

44:50.294 --> 44:53.431
- The usual.
- Of course.

44:59.702 --> 45:02.437
[Naomi] Mr. Banks?

45:02.439 --> 45:04.339
Are you the reporter?

45:04.341 --> 45:07.308
You must be so excited
to be directing Blackbird.

45:07.310 --> 45:09.009
It comes with a huge following.

45:09.011 --> 45:11.680
Well, that depends
what you define as "huge."

45:11.682 --> 45:14.149
[chuckles]
You have 10 minutes.

45:14.151 --> 45:16.484
- Oh, uh, sure.
- [chair scrapes]

45:16.486 --> 45:19.287
The previous director
of Blackbird had cast the film,

45:19.289 --> 45:22.957
but you have decided
to go in a different direction.

45:22.959 --> 45:24.491
Care to comment on that?

45:24.493 --> 45:30.332
Well, they brought me on
because my films breed success.

45:30.334 --> 45:32.066
You wanna write that down?

45:32.068 --> 45:33.200
Yeah.

45:33.202 --> 45:37.372
My films... breed... success.

45:37.374 --> 45:39.374
And did you ever consider
interviewing

45:39.376 --> 45:41.977
the film's previous lead,
Naomi Baker?

45:41.979 --> 45:44.745
- Who?
- Naomi Baker.

45:44.747 --> 45:46.513
Naomi who?

45:46.515 --> 45:50.417
See? I don't know who she is.
No one knows who she is.

45:50.419 --> 45:53.120
In today's marketplace,
you can't cast an unknown.

45:53.122 --> 45:55.490
Off the record,
that's probably what got

45:55.492 --> 45:58.727
the previous director fired
is hiring her.

45:58.729 --> 46:01.261
I'm Naomi Baker.

46:01.263 --> 46:05.066
- What? You're not a reporter?
- There is no reporter.

46:05.068 --> 46:07.401
I've already battled
for this film only to lose it.

46:07.403 --> 46:09.571
I'm not going down
without one last fight.

46:09.573 --> 46:12.173
I don't have time for this.

46:12.175 --> 46:14.241
- Stop.
- Stop?

46:14.243 --> 46:17.078
Two seconds of your time.
I at least deserve that.

46:17.080 --> 46:20.247
I know that this seems crazy,
but I am made for this film,

46:20.249 --> 46:22.082
and maybe
you didn't see it before,

46:22.084 --> 46:24.618
but if this stunt
doesn't prove my commitment

46:24.620 --> 46:27.122
or at least put a sliver
of thought in your mind

46:27.124 --> 46:29.290
about reconsidering me
for this role, then go.

46:29.292 --> 46:30.625
Go be unoriginal.

46:30.627 --> 46:32.292
Go make your lackluster film

46:32.294 --> 46:34.562
with your typical,
processed, cookie-cutter,

46:34.564 --> 46:36.263
Mickey Mouse Club actress

46:36.265 --> 46:39.133
who cannot fucking act
her way out of a paper bag.

46:39.135 --> 46:42.037
With all due respect,
of course.

46:42.039 --> 46:44.374
Hmm.

46:46.176 --> 46:47.511
You're pretty.

46:49.111 --> 46:51.513
- Pretty fucking crazy.
- Yeah.

46:51.515 --> 46:53.781
But maybe that's
what you're looking for.

46:53.783 --> 46:57.285
My contact information.

46:57.287 --> 46:58.520
Sleep on it.

46:58.522 --> 47:01.292
I look forward
to working with you.

47:18.642 --> 47:20.274
Are you okay?

47:20.276 --> 47:22.245
Oh, I'm fine, thanks.

47:30.386 --> 47:33.354
[man] Thanks for coming in
on such short notice.

47:33.356 --> 47:36.156
So what's up?

47:36.158 --> 47:38.561
Well, we're letting you go.

47:40.229 --> 47:43.464
- Fucking kidding, right?
- No, you're fired.

47:43.466 --> 47:46.500
You think I don't know
you're dealing fucking drugs

47:46.502 --> 47:48.102
in my club, huh?

47:48.104 --> 47:52.339
People talk.
Don't try to deny it.

47:52.341 --> 47:55.442
Not to mention you.
You're high half the time.

47:55.444 --> 47:57.615
Look at yourself.
You're a wreck.

47:59.816 --> 48:01.316
I need this job.

48:01.318 --> 48:03.787
I don't care.

48:09.725 --> 48:14.162
Let me guess,
she's here to stop me

48:14.164 --> 48:15.897
from doing something stupid,
am I right?

48:15.899 --> 48:18.803
[sighs]

48:21.338 --> 48:23.270
Do you actually think
I'm dangerous?

48:23.272 --> 48:25.473
Maybe.

48:25.475 --> 48:27.841
Maybe not.

48:27.843 --> 48:30.313
But I am worried about you.

48:31.747 --> 48:35.285
And if you go quietly,
I won't cancel your last check.

48:37.586 --> 48:40.390
Go get yourself clean, man.

49:08.318 --> 49:10.718
Fuck!

49:10.720 --> 49:14.321
Hey, can I get
a bottle of vodka?

49:14.323 --> 49:16.290
Uh, yeah, which one you want?

49:16.292 --> 49:17.959
XO is fine.

49:17.961 --> 49:21.196
Can I see some ID?

49:21.198 --> 49:22.533
Sure.

49:26.970 --> 49:28.535
Hey.

49:28.537 --> 49:30.370
Happy birthday.

49:30.372 --> 49:33.176
Yeah, thanks.

50:03.973 --> 50:05.508
[device beeps]

50:11.680 --> 50:13.416
You don't have a fever.

50:15.785 --> 50:18.388
Can I get you
something to eat?

50:19.756 --> 50:22.490
No.

50:22.492 --> 50:25.859
You've done
everything you can do.

50:25.861 --> 50:29.964
The pressure
you put on yourself...

50:29.966 --> 50:31.769
it's not healthy.

50:36.640 --> 50:38.506
[grunts]

50:38.508 --> 50:39.977
[coughing]

51:06.736 --> 51:09.404
[Naomi] Will? Will!

51:09.406 --> 51:12.409
Yeah. What's wrong?

51:13.877 --> 51:16.009
It's not stress.

51:16.011 --> 51:18.078
What am I gonna do, Will?

51:18.080 --> 51:20.948
What do you mean you?

51:20.950 --> 51:22.984
We've talked
about having kids.

51:22.986 --> 51:26.988
Yeah, but how am I supposed to
build a career and have a kid?

51:26.990 --> 51:29.022
Naomi, this isn't a curse.

51:29.024 --> 51:30.892
Your dreams are still
totally achievable.

51:30.894 --> 51:32.660
- Oh, are they?
- Yeah.

51:32.662 --> 51:34.861
Because my window to achieve
anything in this industry

51:34.863 --> 51:37.531
is very small, and women age
in dog years, you know that.

51:37.533 --> 51:39.700
So what are you suggesting?
That we abort our baby?

51:39.702 --> 51:42.538
- No.
- Okay, so what's the issue?

51:44.006 --> 51:46.941
I'm just scared.
Can you understand that?

51:46.943 --> 51:51.044
Having a family is something
that I wanted to plan for.

51:51.046 --> 51:52.647
I have issues with family.

51:52.649 --> 51:55.352
The only family I have
completely abandoned me.

51:57.053 --> 51:59.120
No one understands that
more than I do.

51:59.122 --> 52:03.961
But I couldn't be happier
than to build a family with you.

52:07.731 --> 52:10.732
All right.
Change of plan.

52:10.734 --> 52:12.500
Where are we going?

52:12.502 --> 52:15.502
- Far away from here.
- Will, I have things to do.

52:15.504 --> 52:18.374
Not today.
Not today, you don't.

52:22.912 --> 52:25.316
[birds chirping]

52:32.722 --> 52:36.926
It's crazy when you stop
and take everything in.

52:39.129 --> 52:42.462
You realize that maybe
you don't have any control

52:42.464 --> 52:44.600
over what's going on,
you know?

52:47.169 --> 52:51.571
Everyone down there thinks
that I'm fearless.

52:51.573 --> 52:54.542
But the truth is...

52:54.544 --> 52:56.379
that I'm terrified.

52:59.448 --> 53:03.417
And it's that fear that drives
me more than anything else.

53:03.419 --> 53:06.456
What are you so afraid of?

53:10.526 --> 53:14.130
I'm...
afraid of being a failure.

53:22.839 --> 53:24.738
I know all this is scary.

53:24.740 --> 53:26.443
I do.

53:27.943 --> 53:29.646
I'm scared, too.

53:33.182 --> 53:36.049
This is what matters, right?

53:36.051 --> 53:37.051
You and me?

53:37.053 --> 53:39.787
[both chuckle]

53:39.789 --> 53:43.691
Maybe it's not about me
conquering the world anymore.

53:43.693 --> 53:46.993
Maybe another Blackbird
will come along, maybe not.

53:46.995 --> 53:49.599
That's fine, right?

53:51.167 --> 53:53.200
None of that changes.

53:53.202 --> 53:55.837
You can still
take on the world.

53:55.839 --> 53:58.205
It's just...

53:58.207 --> 54:00.711
you don't have
to do it alone.

54:08.251 --> 54:10.718
[man] All right,
gargle with the mouthwash.

54:10.720 --> 54:13.790
That's good.
Spit it out.

54:15.492 --> 54:18.258
Give us a big smile.
Big smile.

54:18.260 --> 54:21.495
All right, we got it.
That is a wrap, everyone.

54:21.497 --> 54:23.663
- Thank you very much.
- [stage bell rings]

54:23.665 --> 54:25.633
Good job.
That was excellent.

54:25.635 --> 54:27.767
You did great.
Good job, guys.

54:27.769 --> 54:30.571
- You did really great.
- Thank you, it was so fun.

54:30.573 --> 54:31.872
Here, take your makeup off.
I'll be right back.

54:31.874 --> 54:33.176
Thank you.

54:39.582 --> 54:42.716
[sighs deeply]

54:42.718 --> 54:44.120
[horn honks]

54:48.892 --> 54:51.861
[line ringing]

54:59.868 --> 55:01.637
- [click]
- [woman] Hello?

55:02.972 --> 55:04.238
Elsa?

55:04.240 --> 55:06.142
Are you there?

55:08.711 --> 55:10.310
Hello?

55:10.312 --> 55:13.314
Elsa, can you hear me?

55:13.316 --> 55:15.752
[horn honks, Elsa gasps]

56:03.165 --> 56:04.734
[pounds on door]

56:07.769 --> 56:10.640
[television playing
in background]

56:17.714 --> 56:19.316
Let's make it quick.

56:21.950 --> 56:23.718
Whoa.

56:23.720 --> 56:25.352
Business is good, yeah?

56:25.354 --> 56:28.955
Highs and lows.

56:28.957 --> 56:32.392
You're definitely
on a high, my friend.

56:32.394 --> 56:35.798
Me? Not so much.

56:37.332 --> 56:38.769
That's life, right?

56:41.069 --> 56:43.738
Sometimes you win.

56:43.740 --> 56:47.808
Sometime you lose
your job and your girl

56:47.810 --> 56:50.144
in the same 24 hours.

56:50.146 --> 56:54.180
What?

56:54.182 --> 56:56.383
- Fucker! Fucker!
- [screaming]

56:56.385 --> 56:58.718
- Get the fuck off me!
- [bellows]

56:58.720 --> 57:01.988
[both grunting]

57:01.990 --> 57:03.957
Get the fuck off me!

57:03.959 --> 57:06.826
- Ahh!
- [groans, coughs]

57:06.828 --> 57:09.729
You know,
I'd be happy to put you

57:09.731 --> 57:11.968
out of your misery,
you fucking junkie.

57:13.135 --> 57:16.102
Huh? Huh? Give it to me.

57:16.104 --> 57:19.774
Hey, look at me, fucker!
Fucking give it to me!

57:19.776 --> 57:22.075
Sorry.

57:22.077 --> 57:23.613
Thank you.

57:25.180 --> 57:28.783
We're good now, right?
We're good! Hey, look at me!

57:28.785 --> 57:30.316
We're fucking good now
'cause I think

57:30.318 --> 57:32.852
we can be fucking friends
again now, huh?

57:32.854 --> 57:34.925
God, damn it.

57:37.794 --> 57:39.060
[woman] Can you slate for me,
please?

57:39.062 --> 57:41.361
- Joe Jennings.
- Great.

57:41.363 --> 57:44.098
So we're looking for
a lot of positive energy here.

57:44.100 --> 57:45.466
Yeah, right.

57:45.468 --> 57:47.234
So I'll take you through
the basic premise.

57:47.236 --> 57:48.868
We're walking down
the street,

57:48.870 --> 57:50.970
and something gathers
our interest.

57:50.972 --> 57:54.875
It stops you in your tracks.
Then deliver your lines.

57:54.877 --> 57:58.212
Okay.

57:58.214 --> 57:59.846
[woman]
Fire away when you're ready.

57:59.848 --> 58:01.482
Oh.
[clears throat softly]

58:01.484 --> 58:05.118
[pages rustling]

58:05.120 --> 58:09.323
[rustling stops]

58:09.325 --> 58:11.158
[woman]
We're ready whenever you are.

58:11.160 --> 58:13.763
[doorbell rings]

58:18.801 --> 58:20.837
What the hell happened
to you?

58:36.818 --> 58:40.154
I had my reasons, you know?

58:40.156 --> 58:43.994
I tried to talk to you,
Damien.

58:45.327 --> 58:48.796
- Are you using me?
- Using you?

58:48.798 --> 58:50.964
What is that supposed to mean?

58:50.966 --> 58:55.035
Why else would you be here?
For me?

58:55.037 --> 58:57.874
I destroy everything I touch.

59:01.243 --> 59:03.310
Why is that, Joe?

59:03.312 --> 59:06.814
I'll tell you why.

59:06.816 --> 59:08.452
Because I'm an addict.

59:10.185 --> 59:11.986
You're an addict.

59:11.988 --> 59:13.953
I am not an addict.

59:13.955 --> 59:18.191
Look... it's no secret.

59:18.193 --> 59:20.093
I have my issues.

59:20.095 --> 59:22.962
It's just...

59:22.964 --> 59:26.966
I don't know how to deal
with the rejection, you know?

59:26.968 --> 59:29.904
I've been here four years.

59:29.906 --> 59:32.872
Four years, Damien.

59:32.874 --> 59:36.276
You'd think I've paid my dues.

59:36.278 --> 59:38.912
And then someone like Elsa
just waltzes in here

59:38.914 --> 59:40.950
and immediately books a gig.

59:43.519 --> 59:47.555
How is that supposed
to make me feel?

59:47.557 --> 59:50.857
Not a day goes by in this town
without someone telling me

59:50.859 --> 59:53.026
that I'm not good enough.

59:53.028 --> 59:57.263
I'm either too tall
or too young

59:57.265 --> 01:00:01.238
or too old
or not exotic enough.

01:00:02.305 --> 01:00:04.504
You...

01:00:04.506 --> 01:00:06.540
this...

01:00:06.542 --> 01:00:09.479
it makes me forget
about all of that.

01:00:12.381 --> 01:00:14.785
I'm really not an addict.

01:00:17.019 --> 01:00:19.587
Well, you're lucky.

01:00:19.589 --> 01:00:21.388
'Cause I am.

01:00:21.390 --> 01:00:27.227
Either I quit or I go all in.

01:00:27.229 --> 01:00:29.331
And we both know
I can't quit.

01:00:34.636 --> 01:00:36.339
But you can.

01:00:38.341 --> 01:00:41.011
I'm never leaving you again.

01:01:00.296 --> 01:01:03.330
[line rings]

01:01:03.332 --> 01:01:06.901
Hi, this is Joe.
Leave a message.

01:01:06.903 --> 01:01:08.167
[beep]

01:01:08.169 --> 01:01:11.071
Hey, Joe,
sorry to bug you again.

01:01:11.073 --> 01:01:12.573
I'm sure you're busy.

01:01:12.575 --> 01:01:15.008
I just wanted
to check in with you.

01:01:15.010 --> 01:01:18.412
I'm not sure if you changed
your mind about the other night

01:01:18.414 --> 01:01:21.015
or I don't know what.

01:01:21.017 --> 01:01:24.450
So if I'm bugging you,
I'm sorry.

01:01:24.452 --> 01:01:27.287
I just think when you
come across something

01:01:27.289 --> 01:01:31.058
that feels right,
you go for it.

01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:35.361
Hope to talk to you soon.
Bye.

01:01:35.363 --> 01:01:39.066
[man] Congratulations, Dodge.
You made the department proud.

01:01:39.068 --> 01:01:40.937
Thank you, sir.

01:01:44.205 --> 01:01:46.707
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Oh, Randy,

01:01:46.709 --> 01:01:49.145
- Yeah, come on in.
- Sir.

01:01:53.149 --> 01:01:56.015
I just want to tell you
personally how impressed I was

01:01:56.017 --> 01:01:58.718
with the way that you handled
that incident at the restaurant.

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:00.988
- Thank you, sir.
- Now, Randy,

01:02:00.990 --> 01:02:04.524
I see here that you've been
in the top 10

01:02:04.526 --> 01:02:06.593
of the outstanding pool
for Metro.

01:02:06.595 --> 01:02:09.296
Yes, sir, for nine months now.

01:02:09.298 --> 01:02:12.633
Well.
What better time than now?

01:02:12.635 --> 01:02:15.301
- Sir?
- Congratulations, Dodge.

01:02:15.303 --> 01:02:17.504
The powers that be have decided
that you be transferred

01:02:17.506 --> 01:02:20.607
over to SWAT
just as soon as possible.

01:02:20.609 --> 01:02:24.247
That is, if you're ready
to change out of that uniform.

01:02:26.448 --> 01:02:28.381
I'll take that as a yes.

01:02:28.383 --> 01:02:31.987
Yeah. Yes, sir.

01:02:33.222 --> 01:02:35.992
- You earned it, son.
- Thank you, sir.

01:02:51.506 --> 01:02:53.475
[cell phone chimes]

01:03:03.151 --> 01:03:04.954
[cell phone buzzes]

[cell phone chimes]

01:03:15.798 --> 01:03:17.533
[cell phone buzzes]

01:03:22.370 --> 01:03:23.639

[cell phone chimes]

01:03:40.089 --> 01:03:41.558
[cell phone chimes]

01:04:07.216 --> 01:04:09.683
[reader] Something's
on that mind of yours.

01:04:09.685 --> 01:04:13.220
It's plain as day.
Let's hear it.

01:04:13.222 --> 01:04:16.857
It's just funny
how ironic life is, that's all.

01:04:16.859 --> 01:04:19.359
How's that?

01:04:19.361 --> 01:04:21.662
It's just when you have
everything figured out

01:04:21.664 --> 01:04:24.730
that you're forced
to start all over again.

01:04:24.732 --> 01:04:27.236
Let's see your hand.

01:04:30.673 --> 01:04:33.307
Mm-hmm.

01:04:33.309 --> 01:04:34.741
You see anything?

01:04:34.743 --> 01:04:38.845
Mmm, nothing jumps off your hand
at the moment, no.

01:04:38.847 --> 01:04:41.483
What if I told you
I was gonna be a mother?

01:04:43.385 --> 01:04:45.519
Mother.

01:04:45.521 --> 01:04:47.254
Really.

01:04:47.256 --> 01:04:49.223
[Naomi] Yeah.

01:04:49.225 --> 01:04:51.792
Well, that is a big deal.

01:04:51.794 --> 01:04:55.162
Yeah, it is, it's...
it's funny, you know?

01:04:55.164 --> 01:04:57.897
If you can't see that
in my hand,

01:04:57.899 --> 01:04:59.802
what can you see?

01:05:01.669 --> 01:05:03.669
What do you want from me, huh?

01:05:03.671 --> 01:05:06.506
You come in here
week after week

01:05:06.508 --> 01:05:08.575
with your questions
over and over.

01:05:08.577 --> 01:05:11.345
What do you think $10 buys you?

01:05:11.347 --> 01:05:14.247
You think I care
what happens to you?

01:05:14.249 --> 01:05:16.616
You think I'm interested
in your problems?

01:05:16.618 --> 01:05:18.285
Well, I'm not.

01:05:18.287 --> 01:05:23.423
You're on your own
in this world, young lady.

01:05:23.425 --> 01:05:26.196
You gotta remember that.

01:05:29.330 --> 01:05:31.165
Yeah.

01:05:31.167 --> 01:05:33.703
- Yeah, you're right.
- Keep it.

01:05:48.316 --> 01:05:49.885
[cell phone rings]

01:05:55.557 --> 01:05:57.390
Hello, this is Naomi.

01:05:57.392 --> 01:05:59.859
[Brandon] Is this
the imaginative Naomi Baker?

01:05:59.861 --> 01:06:02.595
This is B squared,
Brandon Banks.

01:06:02.597 --> 01:06:03.796
How are you?

01:06:03.798 --> 01:06:06.633
Uh, yeah, I'm... I'm good.

01:06:06.635 --> 01:06:08.334
Is this for real?

01:06:08.336 --> 01:06:09.970
Yes, this is for real.

01:06:09.972 --> 01:06:12.705
I'm calling 'cause, uh,
I want to reconsider.

01:06:12.707 --> 01:06:14.308
Reconsider what?

01:06:14.310 --> 01:06:15.975
Blackbird.
I want to talk to you about it.

01:06:15.977 --> 01:06:18.611
That is, if you're
still interested in the role.

01:06:18.613 --> 01:06:20.279
You're kidding, right?

01:06:20.281 --> 01:06:22.281
No, I'm serious.
I'm dead serious.

01:06:22.283 --> 01:06:23.917
I want you to meet
some of the investors

01:06:23.919 --> 01:06:25.551
and the executive producers.

01:06:25.553 --> 01:06:27.587
I'm thinking something casual
to start out,

01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:30.957
you know, maybe at my house
sometime this week.

01:06:30.959 --> 01:06:33.627
What do you think?

01:06:33.629 --> 01:06:36.830
- Are you there?
- Yeah, I'm still here.

01:06:36.832 --> 01:06:40.866
Um... that sounds great.
Thank you so much.

01:06:40.868 --> 01:06:43.839
No... thank you.

01:06:48.810 --> 01:06:50.509
[laughs]

01:06:50.511 --> 01:06:51.944
Shut up.

01:06:51.946 --> 01:06:53.412
They called you?

01:06:53.414 --> 01:06:55.015
Brandon Banks
called me personally.

01:06:55.017 --> 01:06:57.817
That's the best news ever.
Why aren't you more excited?

01:06:57.819 --> 01:07:00.254
Just a lot of stuff
you guys don't know about.

01:07:00.256 --> 01:07:01.721
What could possibly be going on

01:07:01.723 --> 01:07:04.357
that is more important
than that?

01:07:04.359 --> 01:07:05.792
I'm pregnant.

01:07:05.794 --> 01:07:08.395
Shut up.

01:07:08.397 --> 01:07:10.529
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

01:07:10.531 --> 01:07:13.966
What do you mean you don't know?
You're not keeping this baby.

01:07:13.968 --> 01:07:15.836
- You can't keep this baby.
- [Elsa] Joe!

01:07:15.838 --> 01:07:17.904
How can you say that?

01:07:17.906 --> 01:07:19.939
It's not something you can just
wave your hand and make go away.

01:07:19.941 --> 01:07:21.741
- It's not that simple.
- I know, Naomi,

01:07:21.743 --> 01:07:25.412
but this is everything that
you have ever wanted, right?

01:07:25.414 --> 01:07:27.013
You achieved it.

01:07:27.015 --> 01:07:29.383
You can have a baby
after Blackbird.

01:07:29.385 --> 01:07:32.785
- Jesus, Joe, are you serious?
- Elsa, stop.

01:07:32.787 --> 01:07:35.288
Naomi needs to be reminded
of why she's here.

01:07:35.290 --> 01:07:37.591
- She needs to hear this.
- [Elsa] Why she's here?

01:07:37.593 --> 01:07:39.593
What about you, Joe?

01:07:39.595 --> 01:07:41.560
What about me?

01:07:41.562 --> 01:07:43.663
Maybe it's time we talk
about the drugs

01:07:43.665 --> 01:07:45.499
- I found in the bathroom.
- Elsa...

01:07:45.501 --> 01:07:49.636
Drugs?
This isn't about me, Elsa.

01:07:49.638 --> 01:07:51.370
I'm not trying to upset you.

01:07:51.372 --> 01:07:54.006
I only bring it up
because I want to help.

01:07:54.008 --> 01:07:55.676
You think I want your help?

01:07:55.678 --> 01:07:58.444
You are such
a fucking hypocrite!

01:07:58.446 --> 01:08:00.446
- Me?
- Yeah, you!

01:08:00.448 --> 01:08:03.549
How convenient
is all of this, huh?

01:08:03.551 --> 01:08:05.651
Did you tell Naomi
that you have a child?

01:08:05.653 --> 01:08:07.988
Did you tell her
that you left your son

01:08:07.990 --> 01:08:10.524
to chase
some selfish pipedream?

01:08:10.526 --> 01:08:12.024
Did you?

01:08:12.026 --> 01:08:13.459
Elsa, you have a son?

01:08:13.461 --> 01:08:15.462
- How dare you?
- [Joe] Please.

01:08:15.464 --> 01:08:16.763
I trusted you.

01:08:16.765 --> 01:08:18.631
You are running
from the same reality

01:08:18.633 --> 01:08:22.469
that I am running from,
admit it.

01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:24.071
Admit it, Elsa!

01:08:24.073 --> 01:08:27.907
I admit that I never planned
on having a child so early,

01:08:27.908 --> 01:08:29.710
but I love my son, Joe.

01:08:29.712 --> 01:08:32.015
Then why isn't he here?

01:08:37.019 --> 01:08:40.288
Don't have time for this.

01:08:50.497 --> 01:08:52.465
I can't...

01:08:52.466 --> 01:08:55.504
do what you do, Naomi.

01:08:57.071 --> 01:08:59.406
And it kills me
to be reminded of that

01:08:59.408 --> 01:09:02.912
every... single day.

01:09:04.779 --> 01:09:06.947
If I had the opportunity
that you had,

01:09:06.948 --> 01:09:09.352
I wouldn't give it up
for anything.

01:09:11.118 --> 01:09:13.654
But I'm not you.

01:09:17.591 --> 01:09:21.827
...you seem like you have
questions about it.

01:09:21.828 --> 01:09:22.895
Hey.

01:09:22.897 --> 01:09:25.765
Naomi.
What a nice surprise.

01:09:25.767 --> 01:09:28.902
- I was hoping we could talk.
- Of course.

01:09:28.904 --> 01:09:30.903
Come on.

01:09:30.904 --> 01:09:35.809
So it was all very... shocking,
as I sure you can imagine.

01:09:35.810 --> 01:09:38.178
And you're the only person
I could think of

01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:39.679
coming to about this.

01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:42.849
I've been doing this
a long time.

01:09:42.850 --> 01:09:45.152
And...

01:09:45.154 --> 01:09:49.188
I've had my share
of crossroads in my career.

01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:51.892
But...

01:09:51.894 --> 01:09:54.627
I gotta tell you...

01:09:54.629 --> 01:09:57.930
having a child is...

01:09:57.932 --> 01:10:00.666
an absolute blessing.

01:10:00.668 --> 01:10:03.536
I mean, it's...
[chuckles] it's wonderful.

01:10:03.538 --> 01:10:06.505
'Cause I've always wanted
to be a mom, you know?

01:10:06.507 --> 01:10:11.077
Yeah, but...
[chuckles, sighs]

01:10:11.079 --> 01:10:14.147
I gotta say...

01:10:14.149 --> 01:10:20.019
I'd be lying if I said this role
wasn't the chance a lifetime.

01:10:20.021 --> 01:10:23.089
I know.

01:10:23.091 --> 01:10:25.759
I just want it so badly,
you know?

01:10:25.761 --> 01:10:28.761
I love teaching.

01:10:28.763 --> 01:10:31.096
I truly do.

01:10:31.098 --> 01:10:34.067
But I have to confess,

01:10:34.069 --> 01:10:37.203
I never got an opportunity...

01:10:37.205 --> 01:10:40.072
like the one you have
right now.

01:10:40.074 --> 01:10:44.109
That's why I teach.

01:10:44.111 --> 01:10:46.114
[both chuckle softly]

01:10:48.784 --> 01:10:50.553
I don't envy you, girl.

01:10:52.721 --> 01:10:56.526
But it's gotta be up to you.

01:11:22.885 --> 01:11:24.951
[Naomi]
Few people know of me.

01:11:24.953 --> 01:11:28.020
Even less know what
I'm trying to accomplish.

01:11:28.022 --> 01:11:30.256
I chose this existence,
and the quest

01:11:30.258 --> 01:11:33.260
I'm about to embark on
cannot be explained.

01:11:33.262 --> 01:11:36.897
[tape rewinds, click]

01:11:36.899 --> 01:11:39.198
Will I choose good
in this world full of evil?

01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:42.102
- [tape rewinds, click]
- Can I forget the past

01:11:42.104 --> 01:11:44.871
that has tortured me and made
me what I am today?

01:11:44.873 --> 01:11:46.642
[tape rewinds, click]

01:11:50.712 --> 01:11:53.246
If it was a hero
you were looking for,

01:11:53.248 --> 01:11:57.253
you may want to keep looking.

01:12:08.195 --> 01:12:10.095
[man] Why am I here?

01:12:10.097 --> 01:12:12.032
I need a job.

01:12:12.034 --> 01:12:15.301
Yeah? Why the fuck
are you coming to me?

01:12:15.303 --> 01:12:18.673
Can't go to Arlo.

01:12:20.609 --> 01:12:22.642
That's why your face
is all fucked up.

01:12:22.644 --> 01:12:26.147
You gonna partner up
with me or not?

01:12:34.355 --> 01:12:35.857
Ah.

01:12:39.127 --> 01:12:42.661
You're supposed to sell
the product, not use it.

01:12:42.663 --> 01:12:44.199
You know that, right?

01:12:48.136 --> 01:12:50.002
I know that.

01:12:50.004 --> 01:12:51.774
Okay, good.

01:13:05.887 --> 01:13:07.187
[van door slides closed]

01:13:07.189 --> 01:13:08.921
[Joe] Any luck?

01:13:08.923 --> 01:13:10.790
We did it.

01:13:10.792 --> 01:13:12.328
[laughs]

01:13:18.165 --> 01:13:19.869
What are you doing?

01:13:24.705 --> 01:13:27.273
That isn't what
I think it is, is it?

01:13:27.275 --> 01:13:29.843
No needles, Damien,
we always said that.

01:13:29.845 --> 01:13:32.949
You got a better idea?

01:13:48.797 --> 01:13:50.031
Gimme your arm.

01:13:53.168 --> 01:13:54.968
Look at me.

01:13:54.970 --> 01:13:59.141
If you don't want this,
tell me right now.

01:14:23.798 --> 01:14:25.264
[Joe moans softly]

01:14:25.266 --> 01:14:28.136
Oh, my God.

01:14:33.742 --> 01:14:35.778
I feel better already.

01:14:42.249 --> 01:14:44.086
[slaps arm]

01:14:57.798 --> 01:14:59.267
Oh, shit.

01:15:16.118 --> 01:15:19.321
[grunting]

01:15:25.427 --> 01:15:27.059
[coughing grunts]

01:15:27.061 --> 01:15:30.897
Joe. Joe?

01:15:30.899 --> 01:15:32.866
Joe? Look at me.

01:15:32.868 --> 01:15:35.201
Look at me, Joe.

01:15:35.203 --> 01:15:37.469
Fuck, Joe. Joe!

01:15:37.471 --> 01:15:39.708
Joe? Look at me.

01:15:44.044 --> 01:15:47.913
Joe. Wake up. Wake up.
Wake up, Joe.

01:15:47.915 --> 01:15:50.015
- [knock on window]
- Security. Pack it up.

01:15:50.017 --> 01:15:52.885
- You can't be here.
- Go away. Go away!

01:15:52.887 --> 01:15:57.090
- [knock on window]
- You got 30 seconds till I call the cops.

01:15:57.092 --> 01:15:59.228
What's going on in there?

01:16:00.829 --> 01:16:03.563
[door slides open]

01:16:03.565 --> 01:16:05.167
[door slides closed]

01:16:07.836 --> 01:16:10.937
Easy there, buddy.
What's with you?

01:16:10.939 --> 01:16:13.907
- Echo 3 to dispatch.
- Stop.

01:16:13.909 --> 01:16:16.876
We're leaving. We're leaving.
Don't do that. Don't do that.

01:16:16.878 --> 01:16:20.078
Please send backup, I have
a subject under the influence.

01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:22.148
- I said don't do that!
- Hey, hey, hey! Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:16:22.150 --> 01:16:24.283
Hold on, hold on, okay?

01:16:24.285 --> 01:16:27.853
Be advised we have on officer
in need of assistance.

01:16:27.855 --> 01:16:30.456
Rover number 133
has been activated.

01:16:30.458 --> 01:16:33.126
Any available units,
please respond. Code 3.

01:16:33.128 --> 01:16:35.060
Just stop trying
to fix the situation.

01:16:35.062 --> 01:16:37.162
Okay, look, you've obviously
got some problems.

01:16:37.164 --> 01:16:39.566
Problems?
What do you know about me, huh?

01:16:39.568 --> 01:16:41.134
Take it easy,
your gun's cocked, man.

01:16:41.136 --> 01:16:43.402
Stop talking.
Just stop talking.

01:16:43.404 --> 01:16:44.504
Let's get you some help.

01:16:44.506 --> 01:16:46.406
Stop talking!

01:16:46.408 --> 01:16:49.178
[ears ringing,
car alarm blaring]

01:17:01.957 --> 01:17:05.291
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

01:17:05.293 --> 01:17:07.492
Oh, my God.
Please don't die.

01:17:07.494 --> 01:17:09.062
Somebody help!

01:17:09.064 --> 01:17:11.367
[police radio chatter]

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:15.837
[tires screech]

01:17:23.278 --> 01:17:25.143
[engine starts]

01:17:25.145 --> 01:17:27.015
[panicked breathing]

01:17:28.016 --> 01:17:29.282
Joe, hold on.

01:17:29.284 --> 01:17:31.420
[tires squealing]

01:17:35.056 --> 01:17:36.221
Joe?

01:17:36.223 --> 01:17:38.157
Hold on.

01:17:38.159 --> 01:17:39.459
Shit.

01:17:39.461 --> 01:17:43.598
Shit, shit, shit.
Fuck!

01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:57.175
[Brandon] There she is.

01:17:57.177 --> 01:17:59.344
Ladies and gentlemen,
Naomi Baker!

01:17:59.346 --> 01:18:00.882
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:18:03.618 --> 01:18:05.151
Wow.

01:18:05.153 --> 01:18:07.286
You have a gorgeous house.

01:18:07.288 --> 01:18:08.587
Thank you.

01:18:08.589 --> 01:18:11.291
I thought you would say
it was unoriginal.

01:18:11.293 --> 01:18:14.294
- Like my movies.
- Oh, no, I'm sorry.

01:18:14.296 --> 01:18:16.129
Can I offer you
something to drink?

01:18:16.131 --> 01:18:18.531
Yeah.
Whatever you're having is fine.

01:18:18.533 --> 01:18:22.935
[Naomi] Oh, my God.
You have a gorgeous view.

01:18:22.937 --> 01:18:24.504
[Brandon] The view.

01:18:24.506 --> 01:18:26.508
That's everything in Hollywood.

01:18:31.712 --> 01:18:33.513
- So.
- So.

01:18:33.515 --> 01:18:35.615
To Blackbird.

01:18:35.617 --> 01:18:38.052
May be it success
for the both of us.

01:18:43.123 --> 01:18:45.157
- Are you okay? Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:18:45.159 --> 01:18:47.059
- Yeah.
- You seem a little nervous.

01:18:47.061 --> 01:18:51.296
Where's that confident girl
that I met at the restaurant?

01:18:51.298 --> 01:18:55.037
It's just been an...
interesting week.

01:18:56.604 --> 01:18:59.339
I'm actually
really looking forward

01:18:59.341 --> 01:19:00.605
to meeting your investors.

01:19:00.607 --> 01:19:03.076
Are you expecting them
anytime soon?

01:19:03.078 --> 01:19:06.245
Uh, with the short notice,
they... they just...

01:19:06.247 --> 01:19:07.679
they couldn't make it tonight.

01:19:07.681 --> 01:19:11.119
I promise you,
you will meet them.

01:19:13.989 --> 01:19:16.221
Okay.

01:19:16.223 --> 01:19:17.927
Listen, that moment...

01:19:19.427 --> 01:19:20.760
at the restaurant,

01:19:20.762 --> 01:19:24.563
you know,
I really admire what you did.

01:19:24.565 --> 01:19:27.599
I play it in my head
all the time now.

01:19:27.601 --> 01:19:28.768
And you're right.

01:19:28.770 --> 01:19:33.005
That...
that kind of spontaneity...

01:19:33.007 --> 01:19:36.945
that passion is exactly
what this movie needs.

01:19:40.147 --> 01:19:42.115
Can I use your bathroom?

01:19:42.117 --> 01:19:44.216
Sure.

01:19:44.218 --> 01:19:46.452
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:19:46.454 --> 01:19:49.224
- Oh, it's over there.
- Okay, great, thank you.

01:19:56.530 --> 01:19:58.566
[door opens]

01:21:08.235 --> 01:21:11.172
[panicked breathing]

01:21:14.609 --> 01:21:16.812
[television playing
in background]

01:21:45.873 --> 01:21:47.675
[Joe coughs]

01:22:03.423 --> 01:22:06.358
[gasps] Oh, What the fuck?!

01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:09.495
What are you doing?!
Oh, it's cold, you asshole!

01:22:09.497 --> 01:22:13.799
Turn it off!
Damien, turn it off!

01:22:13.801 --> 01:22:16.736
- [water stops]
- Oh, Jesus.

01:22:16.738 --> 01:22:21.206
What is wrong with you?
[groans]

01:22:21.208 --> 01:22:24.743
God, will you please tell me
what is going on?

01:22:24.745 --> 01:22:27.748
Answer me, Damien.

01:22:30.450 --> 01:22:31.684
We have to go.

01:22:31.686 --> 01:22:34.857
Where are we going?

01:22:38.293 --> 01:22:40.395
Hey.

01:22:41.628 --> 01:22:43.397
You're scaring me.

01:22:52.906 --> 01:22:57.443
[Will] So...
I assume it didn't go well.

01:22:57.445 --> 01:22:59.248
You haven't answered my calls.

01:23:02.516 --> 01:23:04.819
Are you okay?

01:23:06.620 --> 01:23:08.587
I'm so sorry.

01:23:08.589 --> 01:23:11.991
Sorry? Hey...

01:23:11.993 --> 01:23:14.495
What do you have
to be sorry for?

01:23:17.998 --> 01:23:19.700
I broke our promise.

01:23:22.436 --> 01:23:24.338
I don't understand.

01:23:32.247 --> 01:23:33.815
You fucked him?

01:23:36.918 --> 01:23:39.484
I ca...
I can't believe you.

01:23:39.486 --> 01:23:42.888
- No, Will...
- You selfish...

01:23:42.890 --> 01:23:46.992
Y-you're everything
you never wanted to be.

01:23:46.994 --> 01:23:50.028
Do you even know
if you got the role?

01:23:50.030 --> 01:23:52.430
Do you?!

01:23:52.432 --> 01:23:55.470
After what I've been through,
I better have.

01:23:58.006 --> 01:23:59.604
Will, no, Will.
Will, please!

01:23:59.606 --> 01:24:01.974
Don't you...
get away from me.

01:24:01.976 --> 01:24:06.344
We're having a baby, Naomi.

01:24:06.346 --> 01:24:08.617
And you do this?

01:24:09.984 --> 01:24:12.221
We're not having a baby,
Will.

01:24:17.659 --> 01:24:20.295
What do you mean
we're not having a baby?

01:24:29.904 --> 01:24:31.603
You... you wouldn't...

01:24:31.605 --> 01:24:33.774
No.

01:24:54.928 --> 01:24:57.632
[tea kettle whistling]

01:25:17.718 --> 01:25:20.685
- I know what that is.
- Jesus, Damien, you scared me.

01:25:20.687 --> 01:25:24.122
Those aren't vitamins,
are they?

01:25:24.124 --> 01:25:26.425
What are you talking about?

01:25:26.427 --> 01:25:30.028
You and I aren't so different
after all, are we?

01:25:30.030 --> 01:25:32.430
You know what, Damien?

01:25:32.432 --> 01:25:35.000
I don't need this from you,
not today.

01:25:35.002 --> 01:25:36.801
It's kratom, right?

01:25:36.803 --> 01:25:38.737
Nature's speedball?

01:25:38.739 --> 01:25:42.441
I'm not an idiot.

01:25:42.443 --> 01:25:45.710
A small dose of that
will stimulate you, right?

01:25:45.712 --> 01:25:48.613
Make you feel good and strong.

01:25:48.615 --> 01:25:53.518
But if you have too much,
it gives the opposite effect.

01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:55.688
Fuck's with your mind.

01:25:55.690 --> 01:25:57.857
Yeah, and what would
you know about that?

01:25:57.859 --> 01:25:59.090
Oh, I know all too well.

01:25:59.092 --> 01:26:00.725
It's not illegal, Damien.

01:26:00.727 --> 01:26:04.162
It's not illegal.
Yet.

01:26:04.164 --> 01:26:08.434
Is that how you get
your source of confidence?

01:26:08.436 --> 01:26:10.669
Is that how you become
the machine?

01:26:10.671 --> 01:26:12.505
What do you want from me,
Damien?

01:26:12.507 --> 01:26:15.573
You have your reasons,
I have mine.

01:26:15.575 --> 01:26:18.577
What are your reasons, huh?
Why are you such a fuck up?

01:26:18.579 --> 01:26:22.915
Was your mother a prostitute?
Did she abandon you?

01:26:22.917 --> 01:26:26.852
Look at me.
My mother didn't want me.

01:26:26.854 --> 01:26:29.621
Excuse me if I have trouble
dealing with that, okay?

01:26:29.623 --> 01:26:31.525
What's your fucking excuse?

01:26:37.731 --> 01:26:40.198
I didn't know that about you.

01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:44.103
I ruined everything, Damien.

01:26:44.105 --> 01:26:48.006
I worked so hard.

01:26:48.008 --> 01:26:51.046
[voice breaks]
I'm just like her.

01:26:56.883 --> 01:26:59.718
I came to tell you...

01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:03.022
I'm taking Joe away from here.

01:27:03.024 --> 01:27:04.993
I'm going to make things right.

01:27:12.900 --> 01:27:14.503
So bye.

01:27:21.107 --> 01:27:23.041
[door opens]

01:27:23.043 --> 01:27:24.710
[door closes]

01:27:24.712 --> 01:27:27.582
[cell phone ringing]

01:27:37.091 --> 01:27:38.523
Hello?

01:27:38.525 --> 01:27:41.126
- Hey, Naomi.
- Hi, Anthony.

01:27:41.128 --> 01:27:44.529
I got some bad news.
Um...

01:27:44.531 --> 01:27:46.668
They're gonna go
with someone else.

01:27:49.270 --> 01:27:50.705
Yeah.

01:27:54.775 --> 01:27:57.041
[woman on television]
Welcome to Your Movie News.

01:27:57.043 --> 01:27:59.911
Fans of the upcoming
blockbuster Blackbird

01:27:59.913 --> 01:28:01.980
will be happy to hear
that the lead role

01:28:01.982 --> 01:28:05.251
has been cast with none other
than Caitlin Vivey.

01:28:05.253 --> 01:28:07.719
The new film's director,
Brandon Banks,

01:28:07.721 --> 01:28:10.089
felt that star power
was a key ingredient

01:28:10.091 --> 01:28:11.823
for his film's success.

01:28:11.825 --> 01:28:14.158
The new film begins shooting
in just two months.

01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:17.028
So, fans, the wait
for this flashy action thriller

01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:18.899
is almost over.

01:28:34.214 --> 01:28:36.314
[man]
We'll be located outside here

01:28:36.316 --> 01:28:38.283
in our position TAC vehicle.

01:28:38.285 --> 01:28:40.286
We have a standing warrant.

01:28:40.288 --> 01:28:44.089
We've also had surveillance on
the establishment for 36 hours.

01:28:44.091 --> 01:28:46.291
So we know it's a beehive
of activity.

01:28:46.293 --> 01:28:48.794
Now you three
will be coming with me.

01:28:48.796 --> 01:28:52.965
Any questions?
Let's ship out.

01:28:52.967 --> 01:28:55.733
[line rings]

01:28:55.735 --> 01:28:58.571
Hi, it's Will.
Please leave me a message.

01:28:58.573 --> 01:29:00.040
[beep]

01:29:01.943 --> 01:29:03.744
[crying]

01:29:20.994 --> 01:29:22.260
[knock on door]

01:29:22.262 --> 01:29:25.296
[Elsa] Naomi?
Are you okay in there?

01:29:25.298 --> 01:29:29.870
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry about Blackbird.

01:29:32.306 --> 01:29:33.272
[knock on door]

01:29:33.274 --> 01:29:35.773
Naomi, answer me.

01:29:35.775 --> 01:29:38.978
[Joe] Talk to me.

01:29:38.980 --> 01:29:43.084
Is there something
that you're not telling me?

01:29:45.052 --> 01:29:48.821
Look, I know
that I need help, okay?

01:29:48.823 --> 01:29:51.223
But we don't have any money.

01:29:51.225 --> 01:29:53.895
How are we planning
to pay for this?

01:29:55.262 --> 01:29:57.666
Let me worry about that.

01:30:18.284 --> 01:30:20.854
I leave this message
for Eleanor Wilkins.

01:30:23.190 --> 01:30:24.893
My name is Naomi.

01:30:26.994 --> 01:30:30.332
A long time ago, you decided
that I was not worth keeping.

01:30:34.034 --> 01:30:35.836
I am your daughter.

01:30:37.872 --> 01:30:41.273
We'll wait for confirmation,
then we'll move in.

01:30:41.275 --> 01:30:43.908
Assume everyone inside is armed
and extremely dangerous.

01:30:43.910 --> 01:30:48.714
Weapons stay on safety
till I tell you otherwise.

01:30:48.716 --> 01:30:51.252
I decided to look you up
a while ago, and...

01:30:53.020 --> 01:30:56.188
no surprise,
you have been in prison

01:30:56.190 --> 01:30:59.727
for robbery and prostitution.
[chuckles softly]

01:31:01.227 --> 01:31:03.394
But it turns out that you
and I are just alike

01:31:03.396 --> 01:31:05.363
because...

01:31:05.365 --> 01:31:09.401
I have also used my body
to get what I wanted.

01:31:09.403 --> 01:31:12.737
And I've abandoned
the only family I ever had.

01:31:12.739 --> 01:31:16.974
I spent my whole life trying
to be everything you weren't.

01:31:16.976 --> 01:31:18.680
And I failed.

01:31:20.247 --> 01:31:22.984
I don't want to be
anything like you anymore.

01:31:28.321 --> 01:31:30.421
[Joe]
What are we doing here?

01:31:30.423 --> 01:31:32.926
You gotta trust me.

01:31:35.061 --> 01:31:37.429
Here.

01:31:37.431 --> 01:31:39.768
This'll keep you occupied.

01:31:46.507 --> 01:31:48.376
I'll be right back.

01:32:51.939 --> 01:32:53.874
[Arlo]
Just a minute.

01:33:03.150 --> 01:33:05.983
You got a lot of balls
coming back here.

01:33:05.985 --> 01:33:07.855
Let me make it up to you.

01:33:24.204 --> 01:33:26.037
[groans]

01:33:26.039 --> 01:33:28.473
[Damien] Junkie, huh?
You call me a junkie?

01:33:28.475 --> 01:33:30.209
You fucking lowlife.

01:33:30.211 --> 01:33:31.542
You're a fucking dead man.

01:33:31.544 --> 01:33:34.947
You're a fucking dead man.
Fuck you!

01:33:34.949 --> 01:33:36.982
- Fuck you!
- [door opens]

01:33:36.984 --> 01:33:40.155
- Damien, what are you doing?
- Close the door!

01:33:45.226 --> 01:33:50.131
That's our cue, let's go!
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:33:52.365 --> 01:33:54.398
[Damien] Open the drawer
and fill the bag.

01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:56.503
Joe!

01:34:02.275 --> 01:34:06.077
I'll find you.
Wherever you go.

01:34:06.079 --> 01:34:08.515
Where we're going,
I doubt it.

01:34:12.285 --> 01:34:13.555
Naomi?

01:34:15.321 --> 01:34:16.955
Naomi.

01:34:16.957 --> 01:34:18.490
Take it all. Everything.

01:34:18.492 --> 01:34:20.861
[both grunting]

01:34:24.364 --> 01:34:25.599
Naomi?

01:34:29.203 --> 01:34:30.905
Oh, my God.

01:34:55.061 --> 01:34:56.497
[both grunting]

01:34:58.932 --> 01:35:01.099
[crying] Naomi!

01:35:01.101 --> 01:35:03.872
Naomi, please!

01:35:05.306 --> 01:35:07.542
[choking]

01:35:09.176 --> 01:35:11.012
Agh!

01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:16.348
No...

01:35:16.350 --> 01:35:18.953
What are you... stop.

01:35:28.595 --> 01:35:32.331
- [cocks gun]
- Damien! Stop. Damien!

01:35:32.333 --> 01:35:33.668
[gunshot]

01:35:42.609 --> 01:35:45.079
What did you do?

01:35:55.521 --> 01:35:57.522
- Freeze! Put the gun down.
- Stay where you are!

01:35:57.524 --> 01:35:59.124
- Put it down!
- Drop your weapon now!

01:35:59.126 --> 01:36:01.425
- Put it down now!
- Put it down now!

01:36:01.427 --> 01:36:02.760
Get on the floor!
Drop the fucking gun!

01:36:02.762 --> 01:36:04.662
[Randy]
Get on the ground now!

01:36:04.664 --> 01:36:08.767
[man] Stay where you are!
Put it down now!

01:36:08.769 --> 01:36:11.002
- I'm sorry.
- Drop your weapon now.

01:36:11.004 --> 01:36:13.274
- Put it down, put it down!
- [Joe screams]

01:36:15.042 --> 01:36:16.977
[steady beep]

01:36:21.647 --> 01:36:23.648
Where is Naomi Baker?

01:36:23.650 --> 01:36:26.385
Naomi Baker.
Where is he?

01:36:26.387 --> 01:36:28.623
She's in defib!
Get the crash cart!

01:36:37.397 --> 01:36:39.700
- We're losing her!
- [man] Go ahead, hook her up!

01:36:40.767 --> 01:36:43.501
[man]
Grab the paddles.

01:36:43.503 --> 01:36:46.237
- [woman] All clear.
- [man] Everyone clear.

01:36:46.239 --> 01:36:49.508
[Will] No one ever talks
about the internal struggle

01:36:49.510 --> 01:36:53.077
a caterpillar faces
during this process.

01:36:53.079 --> 01:36:54.578
All clear.

01:36:54.580 --> 01:36:57.314
'Cause if it can just
withstand the agony...

01:36:57.316 --> 01:36:59.117
[man] Out of the way,
out of the way!

01:36:59.119 --> 01:37:01.185
...if it overcome
the doubt of this process,

01:37:01.187 --> 01:37:03.388
it will achieve
its objectives,

01:37:03.390 --> 01:37:07.459
and it will transform
into a butterfly.

01:37:07.461 --> 01:37:09.594
- [woman] All clear.
- [man] All clear.

01:37:09.596 --> 01:37:12.063
[sobbing] Damien...

01:37:12.065 --> 01:37:15.300
Oh, no.

01:37:15.302 --> 01:37:16.367
No.

01:37:16.369 --> 01:37:17.835
[sirens approaching]

01:37:17.837 --> 01:37:20.173
Damien...

01:37:22.575 --> 01:37:25.145
No!

01:37:30.851 --> 01:37:34.122
[respirator hissing,
heart monitor beeping]

01:38:08.187 --> 01:38:09.457
Hello?

01:38:14.261 --> 01:38:16.097
Hello?

01:38:17.763 --> 01:38:19.699
Hello?

01:38:44.824 --> 01:38:46.461
You okay?

01:38:51.230 --> 01:38:53.667
She was out of her mind.
You know that, right?

01:38:58.238 --> 01:39:00.604
I'm starting to think
we all are.

01:39:00.606 --> 01:39:04.479
[sighs] I should have
never come here, Will.

01:39:07.847 --> 01:39:12.584
I kept wanting
to prove to everyone...

01:39:12.586 --> 01:39:15.519
especially myself...

01:39:15.521 --> 01:39:18.525
that leaving my family
was the right choice.

01:39:20.561 --> 01:39:24.196
I guess I felt trapped?

01:39:24.198 --> 01:39:28.265
And I used this to escape?
I don't know.

01:39:28.267 --> 01:39:31.469
But...

01:39:31.471 --> 01:39:34.438
I'm beginning to think
that maybe

01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:36.610
I needed
all of this to happen.

01:39:42.382 --> 01:39:43.818
Maybe.

01:39:49.522 --> 01:39:51.523
What about you?

01:39:51.525 --> 01:39:53.728
What are you gonna do?

01:39:55.962 --> 01:39:58.265
I'm still here, ain't I?

01:40:01.568 --> 01:40:03.434
[woman] She's awake now.

01:40:03.436 --> 01:40:06.207
- Would you like to come in?
- [softly] Yeah.

01:40:22.855 --> 01:40:25.490
[line rings]

01:40:25.492 --> 01:40:26.992
[click]

01:40:26.994 --> 01:40:30.362
[toddler]
Hello, mommy, is that you?

01:40:30.364 --> 01:40:33.965
Yes, sweetie.
It's me.

01:40:33.967 --> 01:40:37.838
I miss you.
When you coming home?

01:40:40.339 --> 01:40:42.407
I'm coming home now,
my little man.

01:40:42.409 --> 01:40:44.376
Yay, she's coming home!

01:40:44.378 --> 01:40:47.281
I love you,
and I'm so sorry.

01:40:49.615 --> 01:40:51.816
I'll never leave you again.

01:40:51.818 --> 01:40:54.685
I love you, too, mommy.

01:40:54.687 --> 01:40:56.390
Bye.

01:41:12.939 --> 01:41:15.874
[lecturer] There's no safety net
in this profession.

01:41:15.876 --> 01:41:18.742
There are no half measures.

01:41:18.744 --> 01:41:20.411
I'm telling you,

01:41:20.413 --> 01:41:25.485
the real truth
to all of this is survival.

01:41:30.089 --> 01:41:32.890
So what are you gonna do?

01:41:32.892 --> 01:41:35.460
I mean, one thing
I can guarantee you

01:41:35.462 --> 01:41:39.867
is that you will crash and burn
in this town continuously.

01:41:41.501 --> 01:41:43.001
It's inevitable.

01:41:43.003 --> 01:41:45.804
This town feasts
on inspiring people.

01:41:45.806 --> 01:41:48.907
It teases you.
It distracts you.

01:41:48.909 --> 01:41:51.608
And eventually,
it reminds you

01:41:51.610 --> 01:41:53.411
you're not good enough.

01:41:53.413 --> 01:41:56.747
It's not supposed to be easy.

01:41:56.749 --> 01:41:59.917
If it were easy,
you wouldn't be here today

01:41:59.919 --> 01:42:01.952
looking for that sharper edge.

01:42:01.954 --> 01:42:04.988
The pace is fast.
The industry is cruel.

01:42:04.990 --> 01:42:07.725
You don't keep a thick skin,
it will consume you.

01:42:07.727 --> 01:42:11.895
And acting,
it's not any different

01:42:11.897 --> 01:42:15.066
from any other aspiration
in life.

01:42:15.068 --> 01:42:17.835
It's just magnified

01:42:17.837 --> 01:42:22.040
because
it's deeply personal.

01:42:22.042 --> 01:42:23.707
Do yourself a favor.

01:42:23.709 --> 01:42:26.111
Eliminate those negative
influences that...

01:42:26.113 --> 01:42:28.880
that drag you down,
that are an anchor

01:42:28.882 --> 01:42:32.050
to your development,
and believe me,

01:42:32.052 --> 01:42:34.885
you need to be brutally honest
with yourself

01:42:34.887 --> 01:42:37.921
and who you really are.

01:42:37.923 --> 01:42:41.693
[Naomi] I leave this message
for Eleanor Wilkins.

01:42:41.695 --> 01:42:43.995
My name is Naomi.

01:42:43.997 --> 01:42:47.101
A long time ago, you decided
that I was not worth keeping.

01:42:48.869 --> 01:42:51.669
I am your daughter.

01:42:51.671 --> 01:42:54.005
[Michael]
One of my favorite sayings...

01:42:54.007 --> 01:42:57.442
the greater glory
is not in never falling

01:42:57.444 --> 01:43:01.078
but in rising
every time we fall.

01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:05.783
This town is waiting
to judge you every day.

01:43:05.785 --> 01:43:08.952
Which one of you
will be that person

01:43:08.954 --> 01:43:11.089
who refuses to quit?

01:43:11.091 --> 01:43:15.926
Which one of you
will be that person...

01:43:15.928 --> 01:43:18.095
that sees it through?

01:43:18.097 --> 01:43:21.633
I have no doubt
that most of you

01:43:21.635 --> 01:43:25.702
have what it takes
to make it in this business.

01:43:25.704 --> 01:43:28.173
