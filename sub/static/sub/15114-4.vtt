Man: <i>Shots fired!</i>
<i>Get an ambulance now!</i>

00:05.394 --> 00:07.361
Tom:
<i>My wife nearly died.</i>

00:07.395 --> 00:08.962
Why hasn't the shooter
been found?

00:08.997 --> 00:11.431
Lack of physical evidence
and the inordinate number

00:11.465 --> 00:14.000
of people who hate you
personally or politically.

00:14.034 --> 00:16.335
There was a time when I could
count you among them.

00:16.369 --> 00:17.969
Can you talk about
the shooting?

00:18.004 --> 00:20.605
I heard a crack and then
Ben was on top of me.

00:20.639 --> 00:22.740
- I'm supposed to clear every word through you?
- You are.

00:22.774 --> 00:24.841
I have a race to win.
I don't have time for this shit.

00:24.875 --> 00:27.010
This is my campaign manager and you're
gonna deal with her from now on.

00:27.044 --> 00:29.278
I don't know what happened
with Kane and I don't care.

00:29.313 --> 00:32.048
This is a team.
You'll be a partner, not a servant.

00:32.232 --> 00:33.499
Tom:
<i>Emma's coming home tonight.</i>

00:33.533 --> 00:35.134
<i>I've arranged</i>
<i>for house arrest.</i>

00:35.168 --> 00:38.436
I'd suggest you temper
your expectations, Tom.

00:38.471 --> 00:40.171
You have to get out
of Chicago.

00:40.205 --> 00:41.839
My father, he doesn't
allow loose ends.

00:41.874 --> 00:44.475
I got nothing left
because of you.

00:44.509 --> 00:46.977
CPD released the file
on Ezra Stone's murder.

00:47.012 --> 00:48.412
It's about damn time.

00:48.446 --> 00:50.781
Don't you think Kane would
be pushing the PD on this?

00:50.815 --> 00:52.248
I don't know what you
want me to say.

00:52.283 --> 00:54.150
Displacing the residents
of Lennox Gardens

00:54.184 --> 00:56.285
will affect your
support across the board.

00:56.319 --> 00:57.319
Your alternative?

00:57.353 --> 00:59.487
Open up the project
to competitive bids.

00:59.522 --> 01:02.156
Competitive bidding is a declaration
of war against McGantry.

01:02.191 --> 01:04.691
I'd like you to take a look at the
numbers on the Lennox Gardens project.

01:04.727 --> 01:06.627
It's a run-down
housing project, Tom.

01:06.662 --> 01:08.096
I need a lower number.

01:09.899 --> 01:12.033
Is this a fucking joke?
This is exactly the same shit

01:12.067 --> 01:15.169
McGantry sent over weeks ago.
Your guy, Young and Mortensen,

01:15.204 --> 01:16.270
pull the trigger.

01:16.305 --> 01:18.273
Greed stops here.

01:18.307 --> 01:20.175
<i>It's a new day</i>
<i>for Lennox Gardens.</i>

01:20.209 --> 01:22.210
Spring has come

01:23.244 --> 01:25.013
Hello?

01:25.047 --> 01:27.081
They got him, Stone.
The man who shot her.

01:27.116 --> 01:29.951
They got him.

<i>Those kids with cancer,

02:42.624 --> 02:44.892

Put men down, too.

03:01.175 --> 03:03.910
One more doesn't matter.

03:03.944 --> 03:07.044
You're sure he's the one?

03:07.078 --> 03:09.905
High-powered rifle
in the trunk of his car

03:09.939 --> 03:12.089
matches the bullet
that struck your wife.

03:12.124 --> 03:14.675
Langley: <i>The fact that he never</i>
<i>laid his own hands on people,</i>

03:14.710 --> 03:19.198
still his sin
in God's eyes.

03:20.693 --> 03:23.254
<i>She was 12.</i>

03:23.288 --> 03:25.281
Kane did that to her.

03:27.256 --> 03:30.413
His army

03:30.447 --> 03:32.274
- <i>all the niggers--</i>
- ( Turns off speaker )

03:32.308 --> 03:34.768
He's referring to the rape
and murder of his niece

03:34.803 --> 03:38.356
19 years ago.
No one was ever charged.

03:38.391 --> 03:40.121
Here.
Adjacent to the 21st.

03:40.155 --> 03:44.109
Sent hate mail over the years
to City Hall about race issues.

03:44.144 --> 03:48.561
Recently he made a death threat
about your public housing plans.

03:52.184 --> 03:53.915
Langley:
<i>I shot photos, too.</i>

03:53.949 --> 03:57.170
Are you saying you have pictures
of the assassination attempt?

03:57.204 --> 03:59.765
Right here.

03:59.799 --> 04:01.693
Cameras in my teeth.

04:06.679 --> 04:09.302
I'll fight any attempt
at an insanity plea.

04:09.337 --> 04:12.031
How do you want to announce this?
Joint press conference?

04:12.061 --> 04:15.319
I'll put out a statement
that we have a suspect.

04:15.353 --> 04:17.880
But I want to keep
Mr. Langley's identity secret

04:17.915 --> 04:20.672
until we've completed
this investigation.

04:20.706 --> 04:22.833
I see.

04:22.868 --> 04:26.254
You'd never know it
by looking at him, would you?

04:26.289 --> 04:28.979
How dangerous a man can be.

04:36.081 --> 04:37.874
<i>( Water running )</i>

04:55.961 --> 04:58.351
They caught the man
who shot you.

05:00.113 --> 05:01.876
He was shooting
at your father.

05:01.911 --> 05:05.098
He hit me.
Is he still home?

05:05.133 --> 05:07.026
No.

05:08.988 --> 05:10.352
( Groans )

05:10.386 --> 05:12.013
Thank you for breakfast.

05:14.976 --> 05:16.172
Emma.

05:19.262 --> 05:22.353
I don't want to be in this
situation any more than you do.

05:26.077 --> 05:27.440
How are you feeling?

05:28.275 --> 05:29.301
Still a lot of pain.

05:35.123 --> 05:37.780
Your father's asked that
we all sit down together

05:37.814 --> 05:39.674
for dinner at some point.

05:39.709 --> 05:40.606
Why?

05:40.640 --> 05:43.097
He seems to think
it would be nice.

05:56.530 --> 05:59.420
Mr. Mayor, what can you tell us
about the suspect in custody?

05:59.455 --> 06:01.549
Honestly, I can't comment.

06:01.583 --> 06:04.244
Not only because it's
an ongoing investigation,

06:04.278 --> 06:07.632
but also because I've got
to catch my breath.

06:07.667 --> 06:09.927
You've been sequestered
for the last few weeks.

06:09.962 --> 06:11.622
How does it feel
to be out in public again?

06:11.656 --> 06:13.450
Wonderful.
Lighter.

06:13.484 --> 06:16.876
Suffice to say,
I don't miss wearing Kevlar.

06:16.910 --> 06:19.467
Can you at least tell us
if the suspect is a local?

06:19.501 --> 06:21.662
I really can't.

06:21.696 --> 06:24.620
I will say that the police
and the state's attorney

06:24.655 --> 06:28.509
are confident that they have the individual
responsible for this near tragedy.

06:28.543 --> 06:32.169
Needless to say, my wife and
I are both greatly relieved.

06:32.199 --> 06:34.694
What was her reaction?
How is Mrs. Kane doing?

06:34.728 --> 06:37.319
She's recovering at home.
She's in good spirits.

06:37.353 --> 06:39.780
My family...

06:39.815 --> 06:42.406
well, we're truly blessed.

06:42.440 --> 06:45.931
And a debt of gratitude goes out
to all the people of Chicago

06:45.965 --> 06:47.392
for their prayers
and support.

06:47.426 --> 06:49.820
It's touched Meredith
and myself deeply.

06:49.855 --> 06:51.148
And it will not
be forgotten.

06:51.182 --> 06:53.743
But now it's time for all
of us to look forward,

06:53.777 --> 06:55.537
not back.

06:55.572 --> 06:57.532
It's a new day in
the best city in the world.

06:57.567 --> 06:59.527
Thanks, guys.

07:03.317 --> 07:05.513
Invincibility
is a myth, Tom.

07:05.547 --> 07:07.375
How long can you
pretend?

07:11.691 --> 07:15.095
"As long as hope

07:20.568 --> 07:23.237

<i>"Sentinel."</i>

07:34.017 --> 07:36.285
At some point, I hope
it dawns on you

07:36.319 --> 07:38.587
that simply doing
your job well

07:38.622 --> 07:42.257
does not merit
commendation.

07:43.426 --> 07:46.428
<i>I want you to find</i>
<i>Kitty O'Neil for me.</i>

07:46.463 --> 07:49.197
A name, a description,
a fucking gender.

07:49.232 --> 07:52.468
Anything but this suspect
in custody bullshit.

07:52.502 --> 07:54.103
What else?

07:54.137 --> 07:55.604
The mayor
on a lakeside walk

07:55.638 --> 07:57.506
says the police are confident
they have the right guy.

07:57.540 --> 07:58.774
No, next.

07:58.808 --> 08:00.809
<i>Every other paper in town</i>
<i>covered this, Sam.</i>

08:00.843 --> 08:03.511
- You want to be the only one that doesn't?
- Proudly.

08:03.546 --> 08:05.614
Kane feels safe enough
to stop wearing Kevlar,

08:05.648 --> 08:08.283
which would suggest this
particular nightmare is over.

08:08.317 --> 08:11.954
If I say no once, Jackie, it means
don't pitch it again, all right?

08:13.289 --> 08:14.790
<i>This is what I want--</i>

08:14.824 --> 08:16.625
<i>figure out who the hell</i>
<i>the shooter is,</i>

08:16.660 --> 08:19.896
why the state's attorney is
fighting transparency on it.

08:59.272 --> 09:00.839
Moving up at work.

09:00.873 --> 09:03.575
Which means I have to
develop a better firewall

09:03.610 --> 09:05.577
between me and this
part of the operation.

09:05.612 --> 09:08.080
So how long's it got
to be like this?

09:08.114 --> 09:10.482
Why? It hurt your eyes?

09:10.517 --> 09:13.685
Besides, by my
estimation,

09:13.720 --> 09:15.320
you still
owe me something.

09:15.355 --> 09:20.159
So if you want your situation
to remain rent free,

09:20.194 --> 09:22.629
sit your ass down,

09:22.663 --> 09:24.363
make sure these lovely young

09:28.068 --> 09:29.435

and have long missed.

<i>Gentlemen, I wanted to</i> <i>present

10:18.652 --> 10:20.486

its ambitious time line.

The mayor's proposal calls
for ground to be broken

<i>It'll be challenging,</i>
<i>but it's doable.</i>

10:34.435 --> 10:35.803

10:35.837 --> 10:38.672
Fast, smart, cheap.

10:39.457 --> 10:40.341
Pick two.

10:40.375 --> 10:41.976
I'm not gonna
do that, Merc.

10:42.010 --> 10:43.878
This time I need
all three.

10:43.912 --> 10:46.647
With all due
respect, Mr. Mayor,

10:46.682 --> 10:49.818
I'm sure my colleagues
would back me up on this,

10:49.852 --> 10:52.654
it's just not practical
to move that quickly

10:52.688 --> 10:54.089
in this economic
environment.

10:54.123 --> 10:55.489
Natural selection.

10:55.524 --> 11:00.294
All of us evolving,
changing in this landscape.

11:00.328 --> 11:03.064
We adapt or we die.

11:03.098 --> 11:04.898
Limited overtime,

no ghost jobs,
no padding.

11:07.402 --> 11:10.204

11:19.915 --> 11:21.783
Stick with me
on this one, Merc.

11:21.817 --> 11:24.519
Come on, there's plenty of
redevelopment projects to go around.

11:24.553 --> 11:27.155
I'm just asking for
special attention paid

11:27.189 --> 11:29.457
to this one.

11:29.492 --> 11:32.627
Does it bother you that
a piece of this is going back

11:32.661 --> 11:36.197
to the same knuckleheads who
screwed it up in the first place?

11:36.232 --> 11:38.466
I'd be worried
it'd happen again.

11:38.501 --> 11:41.169
I'm sure you'd agree
that no single entity

11:41.203 --> 11:43.604
is responsible for the current
state of the Gardens.

11:43.639 --> 11:45.473
All this only
comes into play

11:45.508 --> 11:47.709
if you can get folks out of there
for the demo, though, right?

11:47.743 --> 11:50.311
Fortunately, Mona has strong
ties to the residents.

11:50.346 --> 11:53.848
With the proper plans in place, I am confident
the relocation effort can be a smooth one.

11:53.883 --> 11:57.319
Condolences on the loss
of Ezra, by the way.

11:59.055 --> 12:00.355
I liked him a lot.

12:00.389 --> 12:03.891
I'm pleased to be
working with you gentlemen.

12:06.495 --> 12:07.995
Mm-hmm, thanks.

12:31.153 --> 12:33.521
who's supposed to do
it all on the cheap.

12:33.556 --> 12:35.690
<i>Some asswipe from Indiana.</i>

12:36.959 --> 12:38.560
Young and Mortensen.

12:38.594 --> 12:40.762
<i>That's the one.</i>
<i>Kane's off his nut.</i>

12:42.631 --> 12:43.931
You mind?

12:48.771 --> 12:52.640
He wants it done in two
years for half the cost.

12:54.143 --> 12:57.479
And people are supposed to live
on rainwater or some shit.

12:57.513 --> 13:00.682
- Two years?
- Break ground in six months.

13:00.717 --> 13:03.285
What's the fucking
hurry, you know?

13:05.121 --> 13:07.656
No one man is bigger
than the machine.

13:07.691 --> 13:09.992
It corrects itself.

13:12.562 --> 13:14.330
Always.

13:15.832 --> 13:18.867
Hey, I need those numbers,
UAW benefit packages.

13:18.902 --> 13:20.803
And where we at
on the debates?

13:20.837 --> 13:23.406
Meeting to finalize the details
has been set for tomorrow

13:23.440 --> 13:26.242
with Mrs. Zajac and the representative
from the Walsh campaign.

13:26.276 --> 13:29.845
- Okay.
- Sir, do you need any help on the road?

13:29.879 --> 13:32.081
I'd be happy to go
if you needed me to.

13:32.115 --> 13:35.217
- No.
- You're gonna want to hear this.

13:35.252 --> 13:37.119
Kitty O'Neil's joined
the Walsh camp.

13:38.955 --> 13:40.255
Campaign managing?

13:40.290 --> 13:42.324
Their office just called
to confirm her attendance

13:42.358 --> 13:44.025
at the debate negotiation.

13:45.060 --> 13:46.327
Fuck me.

13:46.862 --> 13:48.997
I'm sure Mrs. Zajac
can hold her--

13:49.031 --> 13:51.966
Do you have a brain in your
fucking head? Shut up.

13:53.501 --> 13:55.335
<i>Have my wife call me.</i>

13:55.870 --> 13:57.804
Now, Patty.

13:59.473 --> 14:01.441
Get her into
a downstate office.

14:01.475 --> 14:03.276
Or better yet,
get her to quit.

14:07.882 --> 14:09.249
Fuck!

14:09.283 --> 14:11.651
( Grunts )

14:11.685 --> 14:15.755
Working with Kane suggests
a certain dogma.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.057
I beg to differ.

14:18.592 --> 14:21.695
This mayor has always been
far more interested

14:21.729 --> 14:24.664
<i>in accumulating power than</i>
<i>a particular ideology.</i>

14:24.699 --> 14:28.401
And Kitty is nothing
if not a pragmatist.

14:28.436 --> 14:30.804
But more importantly,
I'm an admirer.

14:30.838 --> 14:33.873
I've always been impressed with
the state senator's leadership,

14:33.907 --> 14:36.175
her political consistency.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.878
It reveals a strength of
character which, frankly,

14:38.912 --> 14:40.746
I found lacking
in Treasurer Zajac.

14:42.349 --> 14:43.782
Selfishly, looking ahead,

14:43.817 --> 14:45.684
I think her ability
to survive two decades

14:45.718 --> 14:48.586
in Illinois government
with her reputation intact

14:48.621 --> 14:51.089
makes her an ideal candidate
for higher office.

14:51.123 --> 14:52.590
It's my opinion.

14:52.624 --> 14:54.225
<i>Well, I couldn't</i>
<i>agree more.</i>

14:54.259 --> 14:56.027
And yet
I'm still troubled

14:56.061 --> 14:59.097
by the fluidity of your
politics, Miss O'Neil.

14:59.631 --> 15:01.866
In other words,

15:02.301 --> 15:05.270
before he commits
to a whopping donation,

15:05.304 --> 15:08.340
he wants a guarantee that you're
not going to switch sides again

15:08.374 --> 15:10.008
anytime down the road.

15:10.043 --> 15:13.044
( Chuckles ) Well, I'm
sure you can appreciate

15:13.079 --> 15:15.813
that sharing my inside knowledge to
make Catherine the next governor

15:15.848 --> 15:19.616
means I won't be welcome back
across the aisle anytime soon.

15:19.651 --> 15:23.220
She was quite a get,
if I say so myself.

15:23.255 --> 15:25.856
So, where do things stand

15:25.890 --> 15:29.226
with your bill to exclude
felons from voting?

15:29.260 --> 15:31.061
<i>Well, it's currently</i>
<i>in committee,</i>

15:31.095 --> 15:32.630
<i>but the feedback</i>
<i>I'm getting</i>

15:32.664 --> 15:35.633
<i>suggests that we have</i>
<i>a lot of support.</i>

15:35.667 --> 15:37.802
Could you excuse me
for a moment, please?

15:45.510 --> 15:47.777
( Exhales )

15:47.812 --> 15:50.146
Why?

15:53.850 --> 15:55.751
It's all I know
how to do.

15:56.986 --> 15:59.455
I would ask that
confidentiality be respected

15:59.490 --> 16:02.525
and discretion exercised regarding
your time in my office.

16:02.559 --> 16:04.227
- Absolutely.
- Don't say absolutely.

16:04.261 --> 16:05.695
It makes me
not believe it.

16:07.932 --> 16:09.900
I've learned a lot.

16:09.934 --> 16:12.636
Not the least of which
is when to keep my mouth shut.

16:16.207 --> 16:20.143
Occasionally, you had to
deal with the lunatics

16:20.178 --> 16:23.279
who plagued City Hall
with calls and letters.

16:23.314 --> 16:26.616
Does the name
Langley ring a bell?

16:26.650 --> 16:29.019
Chad Langley.

16:29.553 --> 16:31.087
No.

16:33.257 --> 16:35.324
Yeah.

16:35.359 --> 16:37.794
Not for me, either.

16:40.063 --> 16:42.965
( Phone ringing )

16:52.509 --> 16:55.044
You can't just
call me like this.

16:56.847 --> 16:58.314
Where are you?

16:58.348 --> 17:00.783
I'm not going anywhere
without you.

17:01.567 --> 17:03.419
You're a threat to him.

17:03.453 --> 17:05.220
That's not
what he told me.

17:05.755 --> 17:08.056
<i>And plus, how are e they</i>
<i>gonna find me anyway?</i>

17:08.090 --> 17:10.792
Send some cop up in
the Gardens to drag me out?

17:12.628 --> 17:14.663
They're afraid
to come here.

17:14.698 --> 17:18.400
Look, what you know means you're
always gonna be in danger.

17:19.435 --> 17:21.036
Think I haven't spent
my whole life

17:21.069 --> 17:23.172
wondering which way the next
bullet's coming from?

17:24.973 --> 17:26.942
When can I see you?

17:28.411 --> 17:30.146
You shouldn't.

17:32.216 --> 17:33.650
But I want to.

17:33.684 --> 17:37.019
I'm not worth the risk.

17:52.171 --> 17:53.605
Detective Dinovo.

17:54.139 --> 17:55.373
Sam Miller,
"Sentinel."

17:55.407 --> 17:57.743
Sonny Hoskins said
I'd find you here.

17:58.777 --> 18:00.213
Sonny's got a big mouth.

18:01.247 --> 18:02.448
What do you want?

18:02.482 --> 18:04.650
Write an article about
me taking a coffee break?

18:04.684 --> 18:06.952
I just wanted to talk
to you a little bit

18:06.987 --> 18:10.424
about your investigation
into the murder of Ezra Stone.

18:10.458 --> 18:12.560
Can I get you something?

18:12.594 --> 18:15.463
Yeah, a Coke.
Thanks.

18:18.667 --> 18:21.702
Nice speech.

18:21.737 --> 18:24.439
- At the O'Hare ceremony.
- Thanks.

18:24.473 --> 18:27.175
So, Ezra Stone.

18:28.677 --> 18:30.211
Unusual case for you?

18:30.246 --> 18:32.680
Burglary interrupted.
It happens all the time.

18:32.715 --> 18:34.316
I guess I meant big case.

18:34.350 --> 18:35.984
How is it that you got
assigned to it?

18:36.018 --> 18:38.319
Were you just up
in the rotation or...?

18:38.353 --> 18:39.887
Yeah.

18:39.921 --> 18:42.523
I mean, the mayor's top
advisor gets killed.

18:42.557 --> 18:44.726
<i>You think there was</i>
<i>more at play there?</i>

18:44.760 --> 18:47.929
Anything's possible.

18:47.963 --> 18:49.631
So with the city's
budget issues,

18:49.665 --> 18:52.434
you getting much
in the way of support?

18:52.469 --> 18:54.336
I mean, should you have to
expand the investigation.

18:54.371 --> 18:56.105
I'd get it
if it was needed.

18:56.139 --> 18:57.640
Is it?

18:59.310 --> 19:00.810
How much I owe you, Kav?

19:00.845 --> 19:02.212
It's on the house.

19:02.246 --> 19:04.981
I understand you're retiring
in a few weeks.

19:05.016 --> 19:07.684
Any idea who will take over
the case once you leave?

19:07.718 --> 19:08.918
Up to management.

19:08.952 --> 19:11.488
But without much
to go on,

19:11.522 --> 19:13.056
there's a good chance
it'll stay unsolved.

19:16.261 --> 19:17.895
<i>I'll see you later.</i>

19:19.431 --> 19:21.832
I can't tell if he's
using or abusing me.

19:21.867 --> 19:23.601
Or both.

19:23.635 --> 19:26.337
You think it's an accident
he hired you?

19:26.371 --> 19:28.172
If tenants there are
going to buy it at all,

19:28.206 --> 19:29.673
they'll buy it from you.

19:29.708 --> 19:31.976
They sure as hell
aren't going to from him.

19:32.010 --> 19:36.280
Or is he just testing me?

19:36.315 --> 19:40.185
Watching me to see how far
I'll go to keep the job,

19:40.219 --> 19:43.522
even though I made it clear
from day one why I took it.

19:44.556 --> 19:46.091
So quit.

19:48.128 --> 19:50.664
If I did, the residents
wouldn't have anyone

19:50.698 --> 19:52.799
in their corner.

19:52.834 --> 19:55.235
Then quit talking.

19:55.270 --> 19:56.937
( Laughs )

20:06.148 --> 20:08.182
<i>( Moaning )</i>

20:08.217 --> 20:10.218
<i>Oh, God.</i>

20:12.555 --> 20:14.622
Oh, God.
That feels so good.

20:18.761 --> 20:21.129
( Moaning )

20:28.337 --> 20:30.572
I love you.

20:36.046 --> 20:37.914
I love you.

20:44.589 --> 20:46.423
I have a proposal.

20:46.457 --> 20:48.659
It's good to see
you, too.

20:48.693 --> 20:51.227
So Walsh is aggressively
going after Cook County votes.

20:51.262 --> 20:53.430
The numbers are closer
than they've been in years.

20:53.464 --> 20:55.165
It's a real race, Sam.

20:55.199 --> 20:57.066
It's only fitting that the
"Sentinel" give us our due.

20:57.101 --> 21:00.202
- We're covering the race.
- No, something more personal.

21:00.237 --> 21:02.938
An editorial.

21:02.973 --> 21:05.641
I set up the meeting, you hear what
she has to say, see what you think.

21:07.644 --> 21:10.413
That's not a proposal.
That's an ask.

21:12.783 --> 21:16.552
I have information that every
media outlet in town wants.

21:16.587 --> 21:19.789
The name of the suspect in the
shooting of Meredith Kane.

21:22.493 --> 21:25.061
State's attorney
has that in deep freeze.

21:26.262 --> 21:27.729
Reliable source.

21:29.465 --> 21:32.066
- How reliable?
- Very.

21:33.101 --> 21:34.702
Someone in
the mayor's office?

21:37.239 --> 21:39.540
No shit.
Why?

21:41.009 --> 21:42.977
Don't know,
don't care.

21:43.011 --> 21:45.179
My guess is he wants
it out there

21:45.214 --> 21:47.215
but doesn't want the leak
traced back to him.

21:47.249 --> 21:49.250
And you're okay
helping him?

21:49.784 --> 21:51.719
A chit's a chit.

21:51.753 --> 21:53.154
Fairly certain
it has nothing

21:53.188 --> 21:56.124
to do with sabotaging
our campaign.

21:56.158 --> 21:58.626
I mean, Kane's not
worried about Walsh.

21:58.660 --> 22:01.129
Which is why we'll win.

22:01.163 --> 22:05.399
His complacency
and our positive press.

22:05.933 --> 22:07.335
So what do you think?

22:08.804 --> 22:11.572
Do we have a deal?

22:12.741 --> 22:14.709
I don't know, do we?

22:16.078 --> 22:17.378
Well, I'd like to think--

22:26.088 --> 22:27.922
Chad Langley.

22:31.160 --> 22:32.694
Mona:
<i>Sir, you wanted to see me?</i>

22:34.797 --> 22:37.933
Lost a button somehow.

22:37.968 --> 22:39.936
Give me a moment.

22:49.180 --> 22:51.781
I spoke with Mr. Young.

22:51.816 --> 22:54.484
He's arranged to meet privately
with each of our subcontractors

22:54.519 --> 22:56.486
- to go over budget requirements.
- Good.

23:04.161 --> 23:06.362
So?

23:06.396 --> 23:07.697
Oh, yes.

23:07.731 --> 23:09.932
I'd like you to tackle

23:09.966 --> 23:12.000
the Lennox Gardens
relocation sell.

23:12.035 --> 23:14.436
<i>Start getting the word</i> <i>out about
the process</i> <i>of relocation,</i>

23:14.470 --> 23:17.138
its benefits,
the speed required.

23:17.172 --> 23:20.908
Well, I've arranged for mailers
and flyers to be sent out.

23:20.943 --> 23:22.176
<i>I mean you personally.</i>

23:22.210 --> 23:24.111
Knock on doors.
Talk with the residents.

23:24.146 --> 23:27.682
Put a credible face
on all this for me.

23:29.585 --> 23:31.485
Given the density
of the projects,

23:31.520 --> 23:34.088
it seems more effective to
have a crew of volunteers--

23:34.123 --> 23:36.724
Tenant leaders.
Residents with standing,

23:36.759 --> 23:38.726
social, political,
religious.

23:38.760 --> 23:40.829
I assume you know who they
are or can easily find out.

23:40.863 --> 23:43.999
Gain their trust,
secure their cooperation,

23:44.033 --> 23:46.534
and the rest will follow.

23:52.374 --> 23:53.541
Is there a problem?

23:55.010 --> 23:56.477
No.

24:02.817 --> 24:05.753
All: In my thoughts
and in my words

24:05.787 --> 24:09.589
in what I have done and in
what I have failed to do.

24:10.624 --> 24:12.058
Through my faults--

24:12.093 --> 24:14.161
through my fault,

24:14.195 --> 24:16.363
through my most
grievous fault,

24:16.397 --> 24:19.366
therefore I ask blessed
Mary,

24:19.400 --> 24:21.101
ever virgin--

24:21.136 --> 24:23.437
Sir.
I'm so sorry,

24:23.471 --> 24:25.105
but I thought you
might want to know.

24:27.642 --> 24:29.777
Priest: May Almighty
God have mercy on us.

24:29.811 --> 24:32.713
Forgive us our sins and bring
us everlasting life.

24:32.747 --> 24:34.715
If you ever interrupt
me here again,

24:34.749 --> 24:37.518
I will have
your fucking badge.

24:41.856 --> 24:43.724
Posted online, too.

24:43.758 --> 24:46.227
We're getting slammed
with calls.

24:47.463 --> 24:49.531
Corrupt piece of garbage.

24:52.301 --> 24:54.403
God damn it!

25:02.145 --> 25:04.480
<i>( Siren blaring )</i>

25:47.859 --> 25:49.526
I know you're in there.

25:49.561 --> 25:52.562
Mrs. Lewis, can you
please come out?

25:52.597 --> 25:55.265
It's Mona Fredricks,
Janet's daughter.

25:56.267 --> 25:58.001
Please open the door.

25:59.337 --> 26:02.105
<i>Out of respect</i>
<i>for your mother,</i>

26:02.140 --> 26:04.976
<i>I'll talk,</i>
<i>but I can't let you in.</i>

26:05.010 --> 26:06.410
That's okay.

26:06.445 --> 26:07.979
I just want a moment
of your time to talk about

26:08.013 --> 26:10.014
the redevelopment
of the Gardens.

26:11.048 --> 26:13.317
As a tenant leader
here you should know--

26:13.352 --> 26:14.852
So it's true.

26:14.887 --> 26:17.054
You're working
for the man now.

26:18.390 --> 26:19.523
Yes.

26:19.557 --> 26:22.192
And you all right with
what he's trying to do?

26:22.227 --> 26:25.195
Trying to chase us off,
put up a mall of something?

26:25.229 --> 26:27.764
We lost the fight,
Mrs. Lewis.

26:27.798 --> 26:29.832
The Gardens
are coming down.

26:29.867 --> 26:33.969
I'm here to help save as much
of the community as I can.

26:34.004 --> 26:37.273
The mayor's guaranteed 30% of the
new buildings will be Section 8.

26:37.307 --> 26:39.208
And you believe that shit?

26:39.242 --> 26:41.476
- I have to.
- Then what?

26:41.511 --> 26:45.780
Who decides who comes back?
You? The mayor?

26:45.815 --> 26:47.982
Kenya Taylor?
Mm-mmm.

26:48.017 --> 26:51.053
Better the way things are
than nothing at all.

26:51.087 --> 26:53.521
That's what
everybody's saying.

27:00.195 --> 27:02.763
- Looking for me, sir?
- Close the door.

27:11.675 --> 27:13.776
Have a seat.

27:17.815 --> 27:19.449
Miss Fredricks?

27:19.483 --> 27:21.084
Making the rounds
at Lennox Gardens.

27:21.118 --> 27:23.219
You ever been?

27:23.254 --> 27:25.621
No, sir.

27:25.656 --> 27:27.924
Growing up, the consensus
was that my neighborhood

27:27.958 --> 27:29.692
<i>knew its boundaries</i>
<i>and vice versa.</i>

27:29.726 --> 27:32.861
Have you?

27:32.896 --> 27:34.430
Tell him you left
your mark there.

27:35.698 --> 27:37.699
It wasn't always
as it is today.

27:37.733 --> 27:40.868
A hopeless hell in
the shadow of downtown.

27:41.870 --> 27:43.604
You did that.

27:43.639 --> 27:46.440
<i>Ignored the cries</i>
<i>of the desperate.</i>

27:48.109 --> 27:49.844
Too late to fix
it now, Tom.

27:59.956 --> 28:01.757
Is there anything
I can do for you, sir?

28:11.167 --> 28:13.402
I want you to make
a delivery for me.

28:21.377 --> 28:23.979
The Lion and Lamb Pub.

28:24.013 --> 28:27.049
The owner, Ryan Kavanaugh,

28:27.083 --> 28:29.118
is expecting this.

28:30.152 --> 28:33.022
Do not pass along work
to a phone monkey.

28:33.056 --> 28:35.390
When I give it to you,

28:35.425 --> 28:37.526
this is your task.

28:39.162 --> 28:40.362
Understood.

28:51.941 --> 28:53.942
Is there wisdom
in this, Tom?

28:53.976 --> 28:57.011
Trust is so tricky

28:57.046 --> 28:59.880
<i>when you're not worthy</i>
<i>of it yourself.</i>

29:10.892 --> 29:12.626
Kenya:
<i>Oh, you a man, huh? Huh?</i>

29:12.660 --> 29:15.194
<i>You a man now, huh?</i>
<i>You gonna jump up at me, boy?</i>

29:15.229 --> 29:17.464
<i>Boy, don't you ever</i>
<i>in your life--</i>

29:17.498 --> 29:19.432
<i>you know who</i>
<i>the fuck I am? Huh?</i>

29:19.466 --> 29:21.701
You know who the fuck I am, boy?
What's wrong with you, boy?

29:21.735 --> 29:23.569
Leave him alone.
Leave him alone. I'll sign it.

29:23.604 --> 29:25.371
Shut the fuck up.
Ain't nobody talking to you.

29:25.405 --> 29:28.907
Hey, what are you doing?
Stop or I'll call the police.

29:28.942 --> 29:30.442
They don't come here,
remember?

29:30.477 --> 29:31.911
Ma'am, is this man
bothering you?

29:31.945 --> 29:34.714
- It's okay. I'm fine.
- She's more than fine.

29:34.748 --> 29:38.318
She's informed now.
That's all this is.

29:38.353 --> 29:40.321
A ward boss advising
constituents.

29:40.355 --> 29:41.822
Give me a fucking
break, Kenya.

29:41.857 --> 29:44.258
Nice mouth on the lady
from City Hall.

29:44.292 --> 29:46.093
Thanks for
the signature.

29:46.127 --> 29:49.263
- Let me see that.
- Nothing illegal.

29:49.297 --> 29:51.332
Quite the contrary.

29:51.366 --> 29:53.167
Affidavit.

29:53.201 --> 29:55.403
Going door to door
just like you.

29:55.437 --> 29:58.706
Already got 200 signatures towards
filing a class action lawsuit

29:58.741 --> 30:01.275
to keep the buildings
from condemnation.

30:01.309 --> 30:03.343
Well, 201, thanks
to Miss Karen.

30:05.613 --> 30:07.414
Ma'am, tell me
what happened.

30:07.449 --> 30:10.184
I want you all
to leave us alone.

30:27.904 --> 30:29.905
<i>Mr. Kavanaugh?</i>

30:32.175 --> 30:33.776
The mayor asked me
to get this to you.

30:43.254 --> 30:44.888
I've been to a lot
of bars in this town,

30:44.923 --> 30:47.424
but I'm pretty sure I've never
set foot in this one.

30:47.458 --> 30:49.392
You even old enough
to drink?

30:51.295 --> 30:52.896
Plenty.

30:52.931 --> 30:55.299
But I think I'll just
have some water, thank you.

31:00.072 --> 31:01.807
Have you owned it long?

31:01.841 --> 31:04.475
Been in the family
long before me.

31:04.510 --> 31:07.746
The mayor and I practically
grew up on these bar stools.

31:07.780 --> 31:09.814
( Laughs )
Oh, yeah?

31:11.150 --> 31:12.784
What was he like
back then?

31:12.818 --> 31:14.085
More hair.

31:22.662 --> 31:24.230
Is that your wife
in that picture?

31:24.264 --> 31:27.266
No, a couple of good-time
girls is all.

31:27.300 --> 31:29.668
We used to have to beat them
off with a stick back then.

31:33.640 --> 31:35.675
I'll bet you did.

32:04.371 --> 32:06.306
( Groans )

32:11.245 --> 32:14.781
( Groans )

32:16.250 --> 32:18.952
( Crying )

32:18.986 --> 32:21.488
Emma.

32:21.522 --> 32:22.956
Emma!

32:30.030 --> 32:32.465
Help me.

32:32.500 --> 32:34.968
<i>Help me.</i>

32:36.170 --> 32:38.738
Fine.
I don't need you.

32:38.773 --> 32:40.908
<i>I don't need</i>
<i>anyone.</i>

32:47.748 --> 32:50.117
( Sobbing )

32:58.960 --> 33:02.729
Are you saying Kenya Taylor
is working independently?

33:03.264 --> 33:05.733
He's an enthusiastic
ward boss

33:05.767 --> 33:07.735
with close ties
to the Gardens.

33:07.769 --> 33:11.206
Now, did he advise me of his
plan to gather signatures?

33:11.240 --> 33:13.108
No, he did not.

33:13.142 --> 33:16.845
Do I applaud his strategies to stop
people's homes from being condemned?

33:16.879 --> 33:20.349
Let's just say
I appreciate his passion.

33:20.384 --> 33:23.186
And what about his tactics?

33:23.220 --> 33:24.754
Do you approve of those?

33:24.788 --> 33:26.856
I'm not sure
what you're suggesting.

33:26.890 --> 33:29.492
Physical intimidation.
Threats.

33:29.526 --> 33:31.827
Harassment.

33:31.862 --> 33:34.764
I'm not aware of any complaints
that have been made.

33:34.798 --> 33:37.766
Would you really do this?
Keep decent people

33:37.801 --> 33:40.036
under the thumb of gangs
and drug dealers

33:40.070 --> 33:42.405
just so you can maintain
a voting block?

33:42.440 --> 33:44.107
Time.

33:44.141 --> 33:47.144
From what I'm told, that's
all anyone's asking for.

33:47.178 --> 33:50.147
Now the mayor may have
his bulldozers at the ready,

33:50.181 --> 33:53.584
but not everyone's prepared
to move just yet.

33:53.618 --> 33:56.487
So let it fester
for another 10 years

33:56.521 --> 33:58.823
while a lawsuit creeps
through the courts?

33:59.857 --> 34:03.194
How many kids join gangs,
get hooked on drugs,

34:03.229 --> 34:05.329
die during that time?

34:09.702 --> 34:11.735
As long as you
worked for me,

34:12.271 --> 34:14.139
never could have
predicted it.

34:14.672 --> 34:18.409
Using the plight
of your own people

34:18.444 --> 34:20.746
to do Kane's dirty work.

34:20.780 --> 34:24.081
Excuse me, sir.

34:24.116 --> 34:26.451
Have that list of precinct
captains you requested.

34:26.485 --> 34:28.253
<i>Thank you.</i>

34:28.286 --> 34:30.688
Trey Rogers, one of
our new aides.

34:32.158 --> 34:33.592
Pleasure to meet
you, Miss Fredricks.

34:33.626 --> 34:35.293
Heard great things.

34:35.328 --> 34:38.429
Who's the traitor
here, William?

34:40.966 --> 34:42.033
Who isn't?

34:48.308 --> 34:50.641
Man: <i>Mrs. Zajac,</i>
<i>Kitty O'Neil is here for you.</i>

34:50.676 --> 34:52.577
Maggie.

34:52.612 --> 34:55.114
Thank you
for meeting me here.

34:55.148 --> 34:57.883
I would have come to you, but
you know how insane it can get.

34:57.917 --> 35:01.119
Campaign manager.
That's quite a promotion.

35:01.153 --> 35:02.521
It is.

35:02.555 --> 35:04.689
As if being mother
to two boys wasn't enough.

35:04.724 --> 35:07.092
Three, if you count
my husband.

35:07.626 --> 35:10.262
Do you mind if we just jump
to the details of the debate?

35:10.296 --> 35:12.631
- I don't have much time.
- By all means.

35:12.665 --> 35:14.366
Okay.

35:15.869 --> 35:18.137
I know Ben's strengths,
and I'm sure you understand

35:18.171 --> 35:20.372
my candidate's
assets as well.

35:20.407 --> 35:22.641
I assume you would
prefer a town hall,

35:22.676 --> 35:24.411
but I want to propose
a traditional debate--

35:24.445 --> 35:27.247
podiums, moderators.
I just think it's more statesmanlike.

35:27.281 --> 35:28.749
He needs that.

35:28.783 --> 35:30.718
You're doing us
a favor?

35:30.752 --> 35:33.487
Despite your husband's
flair for spontaneity,

35:33.522 --> 35:35.623
I actually think it's
a better play all around.

35:35.657 --> 35:38.459
Prescreened questions,
no surprises.

35:41.464 --> 35:43.132
Potential moderators.

35:45.269 --> 35:48.671
For your cooperation, we will
give you the downstate location.

35:48.705 --> 35:51.373
Sound fair?

35:51.408 --> 35:54.978
Town hall, Cook County.

35:57.248 --> 35:59.049
I'm sorry...

35:59.083 --> 36:01.118
have you actually
discussed this with Ben?

36:01.152 --> 36:02.853
Because he needs
rural voters.

36:02.888 --> 36:05.656
He would actually, I think,
want a small-town location.

36:05.690 --> 36:07.524
Cut the bullshit, Kitty.

36:07.559 --> 36:09.826
We both know the race
is about Cook County.

36:11.362 --> 36:13.330
Town hall at UIC.

36:13.364 --> 36:14.998
Pass.

36:15.032 --> 36:17.000
If the polls
are any indication,

36:17.034 --> 36:19.135
you need this debate
more than we do.

36:19.169 --> 36:22.171
So another time's fine.

36:26.108 --> 36:28.777
I know, by the way.

36:30.647 --> 36:32.314
About you and Ben.

36:35.785 --> 36:37.052
But you're one of many.

36:43.660 --> 36:46.596
Town hall, Evanston.

36:49.366 --> 36:51.368
Fine.

36:59.611 --> 37:02.079
Tom: <i>How close are they</i>
<i>to filing?</i>

37:02.114 --> 37:03.547
Mona:
<i>300 more signatures,</i>

37:03.582 --> 37:06.050
which shouldn't take more
than two days to gather.

37:06.084 --> 37:07.251
And who get out to vote?

37:07.286 --> 37:10.988
Gangbangers with their fingers
in the political pot.

37:11.023 --> 37:12.890
Krall & Associates
has been retained.

37:12.925 --> 37:14.859
It can't become
another O'Hare.

37:14.894 --> 37:17.695
At this point, I'm not sure what we can
do to stop that from being the case.

37:17.730 --> 37:21.699
And in the spirit
of full disclosure,

37:21.733 --> 37:24.502
I'm not sure
it's right to try.

37:24.537 --> 37:26.705
She knows what
you did, Tom.

37:29.609 --> 37:30.742
Explain.

37:31.776 --> 37:34.679
The residents live
in fear of Kenya Taylor.

37:35.714 --> 37:37.849
But he's the devil
they know.

37:37.883 --> 37:40.018
And they don't know me.

37:41.420 --> 37:42.921
They know you
abandoned them.

37:44.523 --> 37:46.158
There it is.

37:46.192 --> 37:48.693
They have every reason to
believe you'll do it again.

37:48.727 --> 37:51.862
<i>Only a fraction of</i> <i>the residents
will be</i> <i>back after the rebuild.</i>

37:51.897 --> 37:55.132
<i>The rest will be on their own</i>
<i>without subsidized housing.</i>

37:55.166 --> 37:57.901
<i>Or in another neighborhood</i>
<i>away from their friends,</i>

37:57.936 --> 38:02.106
their churches, their lives,
or on the streets.

38:06.711 --> 38:08.278
Are you quitting?

38:14.685 --> 38:18.355
I've... arranged

38:18.389 --> 38:21.491
for a community
meeting tomorrow,

38:21.526 --> 38:25.095
try to assuage
their fears.

38:25.129 --> 38:27.131
Not sure I'll be
able to do it.

38:30.168 --> 38:32.736
Because even you
don't believe

38:32.771 --> 38:34.605
I'm a man of my word.

38:37.041 --> 38:39.276
This is--

38:39.310 --> 38:41.411
this is just hard
for me.

38:43.514 --> 38:45.749
All this.

38:54.025 --> 38:56.793
How can she
forgive you, Tom?

38:56.828 --> 38:58.729
How can anyone?

39:25.623 --> 39:27.757
How long has it been?

39:30.293 --> 39:33.796
Since we were all together
under the same roof?

39:34.898 --> 39:38.333
Since we sat down

39:38.367 --> 39:40.568
for a meal like this?

39:43.205 --> 39:45.339
10 years.

39:50.846 --> 39:52.813
How was your day today?

39:58.052 --> 39:59.318
Sit down.

40:07.728 --> 40:09.629
We are going to sit here

40:10.664 --> 40:12.900
and eat

40:13.935 --> 40:15.670
and talk.

40:18.140 --> 40:20.709
Fine.
Let's talk.

40:22.612 --> 40:24.747
Your disease.

40:24.781 --> 40:26.415
What are you
doing about it?

40:34.925 --> 40:36.892
Regular examinations.

40:36.926 --> 40:38.927
Calibrated meds.

40:38.962 --> 40:41.463
<i>Exercise.</i>

40:41.497 --> 40:43.131
( Chuckles )

40:43.165 --> 40:45.133
Exercise?

40:47.502 --> 40:49.403
Clearly you have
an opinion.

40:49.437 --> 40:51.905
There's an experimental
treatment.

40:52.440 --> 40:53.774
In Canada.

40:54.876 --> 40:56.843
Oh.

40:56.877 --> 41:00.146
You appear free from
physical symptoms right now.

41:00.180 --> 41:03.649
But I'm far more concerned
about mental decline.

41:04.433 --> 41:06.351
Hallucinations.

41:07.687 --> 41:10.656
A shift towards
the sentimental.

41:12.259 --> 41:14.260
Sentiment.

41:14.295 --> 41:15.895
Really?

41:15.929 --> 41:20.033
Well, here we are.

41:29.176 --> 41:31.278
What do I have to do to
make this a goddamn family?

41:31.312 --> 41:33.680
You can't.
You destroyed any hope of that.

41:33.715 --> 41:35.883
You're not a father,
you're a monster.

41:35.917 --> 41:37.284
You can't change it.

41:37.318 --> 41:39.052
I'm not gonna sit here
watching you pretend.

41:51.233 --> 41:53.701
Some things are best
left broken.

42:48.425 --> 42:49.659
Mona:
<i>Good morning.</i>

42:49.694 --> 42:51.761
- Can I talk to you about the redevelopment plan?
- No.

42:53.197 --> 42:55.032
Excuse me, sir.
Can I talk to you

42:55.066 --> 42:57.534
- about the redevelopment of the Gardens?
- No, uh-uh.

42:59.204 --> 43:01.605
Excuse me, sir.
Can I talk to you

43:01.640 --> 43:04.108
for a moment about the
redevelopment plan of the Gar--

43:14.253 --> 43:15.653
<i>Good morning, sir.</i>

43:15.688 --> 43:18.690
Guess I was wrong
about the cops.

43:58.565 --> 43:59.966
Mr. Mayor.

44:16.551 --> 44:18.486
I...

44:21.356 --> 44:23.557
I haven't set foot here

44:24.591 --> 44:26.393
for over 20 years.

44:28.562 --> 44:31.364
<i>I haven't protected you</i>
<i>as I should have</i>

44:31.399 --> 44:33.433
<i>or as you've deserved.</i>

44:33.467 --> 44:35.535
And for that,
I ask your forgiveness.

44:40.408 --> 44:42.343
I'm not here
to bullshit you.

44:42.877 --> 44:44.712
<i>If I had, the press would be</i>
<i>covering the hell out of this.</i>

44:44.746 --> 44:47.115
But they're not.

44:48.149 --> 44:50.519
Because I wanted you
to hear it from me,

44:50.553 --> 44:52.788
not from your TVs,
not from your radios,

44:52.822 --> 44:54.656
not from the newspapers.

44:54.691 --> 44:57.159
Every family
in good standing,

44:57.193 --> 44:59.294
<i>every law-abiding citizen</i>

44:59.329 --> 45:02.197
will be welcomed back
when the construction

45:02.232 --> 45:04.566
for the new Lennox Gardens
is completed.

45:06.436 --> 45:08.504
<i>You will all come home.</i>
<i>No one will be abandoned.</i>

45:08.538 --> 45:10.606
Kenya:
<i>Don't listen to this shit.</i>

45:10.640 --> 45:12.507
Kane is a goddamn liar.

45:12.542 --> 45:14.643
And when you do come home,

45:14.677 --> 45:17.313
the likes of Kenya Taylor
will not be here

45:17.347 --> 45:19.715
to keep your families
in a world

45:19.749 --> 45:22.718
of brutality
and poverty.

45:22.752 --> 45:25.421
He will not be here to sell
drugs to your children.

45:25.455 --> 45:28.123
- Or steal your vote.
- Get your hands--

45:28.158 --> 45:29.892
- <i>Or profit from your misery.</i>
- <i>You can't arrest me!</i>

45:29.926 --> 45:32.428
- What are the charges?
- Bribery and extortion.

45:32.462 --> 45:34.663
- Let's go.
- You think you can come in my house?

45:34.698 --> 45:38.367
Fuck you, Kane!
You can't change shit!

45:38.402 --> 45:40.403
<i>Fuck you!</i>

45:43.106 --> 45:46.008
Mona Fredricks,
she grew up here.

45:46.542 --> 45:49.878
She is your direct
connection to City Hall.

45:49.913 --> 45:51.914
She is and has been
your advocate.

45:51.948 --> 45:53.916
She believes in this plan.

45:53.950 --> 45:55.684
So do I.

45:55.719 --> 45:59.254
Crime and racism stand
in the way of hope here.

46:00.823 --> 46:03.258
But we will
overcome them.

46:04.461 --> 46:06.395
Past mistakes...

46:08.565 --> 46:10.766
will be corrected.

46:10.801 --> 46:15.337
And the ground that
we're all standing on

46:15.372 --> 46:18.974
<i>will be a good place</i>
<i>to live once more.</i>

46:19.008 --> 46:20.509
You have my word.

46:29.386 --> 46:32.355
I'd like to say hi.
Thanks for listening.

46:32.389 --> 46:34.256
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

46:34.291 --> 46:37.393
What's it mean?

46:39.262 --> 46:40.896
What it says.

46:42.766 --> 46:44.700
You want to make a trade?

46:46.336 --> 46:49.538
A little bit of this shit
for a little bit of me.

46:49.573 --> 46:51.307
Hey, no.

46:52.341 --> 46:53.642
I got somebody.

46:54.511 --> 46:56.345
Hey, no.

46:57.380 --> 46:58.547
No.

47:07.223 --> 47:09.725
Reporter: <i>In only his second</i>
<i>public appearance</i>

47:09.759 --> 47:13.262
<i>since the O'Hare ceremony</i> <i>shooting
suspect was taken</i> <i>into custody,</i>

47:13.297 --> 47:15.597
<i>Mayor Kane made what</i>
<i>has been described</i>

47:15.632 --> 47:18.434
<i>as an impromptu talk</i>
<i>at Lennox Gardens.</i>

47:18.468 --> 47:20.904
<i>Cell phone footage</i>
<i>provided by an observer</i>

47:20.938 --> 47:23.640
<i>shows Mayor Kane addressing</i>
<i>the obstacles</i>

47:23.675 --> 47:25.075
<i>to his redevelopment plan.</i>

47:25.109 --> 47:26.777
He had a lot
of political capital

47:26.811 --> 47:28.912
coming out of that
assassination attempt.

47:28.947 --> 47:32.415
It's just hard to understand why he'd
be willing to throw it away on this.

47:32.450 --> 47:33.883
It's fine by me.

47:33.918 --> 47:37.153
A misstep for Kane is a misstep
for his empty-suited candidate.

47:38.187 --> 47:41.057
Are we confirmed on the details
of the upcoming debate?

47:42.393 --> 47:44.193
All of them?

47:44.228 --> 47:45.961
Yes, ma'am.

47:58.341 --> 48:00.975
- Hey.
- Hi.

48:01.977 --> 48:03.778
- How was it out there?
- It was good.

48:03.813 --> 48:05.713
Covered a lot of ground.

48:05.748 --> 48:07.281
So how'd it go
with Kitty?

48:07.316 --> 48:08.949
<i>She tried to play hardball.</i>

48:08.984 --> 48:10.818
For a self-proclaimed
politico,

48:10.853 --> 48:13.087
she's not as tough
as she thinks.

48:13.122 --> 48:17.058
We agreed to a town hall
debate in the suburbs.

48:17.993 --> 48:19.027
Why?

48:19.161 --> 48:20.862
Why what?

48:21.397 --> 48:24.132
We wanted an informal town hall
in Cook County and we got it?

48:24.667 --> 48:26.602
That's right.

48:29.205 --> 48:32.141
And Kitty didn't try to bargain
for anything in return?

48:32.175 --> 48:34.309
<i>Not really, no.</i>

48:34.343 --> 48:36.311
Not really?

48:38.248 --> 48:40.616
You gave me the job
for a reason, Ben.

48:42.118 --> 48:44.820
Why does it surprise you that I
actually might have outplayed her?

48:48.658 --> 48:51.727
He's taken it beyond
simple redevelopment.

48:51.762 --> 48:54.364
He's lowering
property values now.

48:54.398 --> 48:56.266
I just don't know
what he's thinking.

48:58.970 --> 49:01.071
And his general contractor?

49:01.105 --> 49:03.840
He's still on board
and on budget.

49:03.875 --> 49:05.642
Even with the freebies.

49:07.612 --> 49:10.380
No one's gonna make
dick off this thing.

49:14.085 --> 49:16.954
Lucky if we don't
lose what we got.

49:21.393 --> 49:23.660
Take care of it.

49:23.694 --> 49:25.462
( Taps window )

49:41.512 --> 49:44.381
Sir.
The state's attorney--

49:47.419 --> 49:49.587
This redevelopment
must mean a lot to you.

49:54.793 --> 49:56.727
I'd like to say I'm here

49:56.761 --> 49:59.062
because we're moving forward
with the indictment,

49:59.097 --> 50:01.732
but that would be inaccurate.

50:01.766 --> 50:03.767
Two steps back, Tom.

50:11.309 --> 50:14.344
My job has been made
more difficult

50:14.378 --> 50:15.712
because of an agenda.

50:17.015 --> 50:19.383
And it will protract
the process.

50:35.265 --> 50:37.900
I wanted to give you
the courtesy of hearing that.

50:41.170 --> 50:43.170
Personally.

52:08.526 --> 52:10.494
Reporter:
<i>There was a connection.</i>

52:10.528 --> 52:13.930
<i>Meteorologists are baffled by</i>
<i>the complex magnetic storm</i>

52:13.965 --> 52:15.398
<i>that appeared to be moving</i>
<i>across the region.</i>

52:15.433 --> 52:17.834
We'll keep you up to date
on these weather patterns

52:17.869 --> 52:19.736
<i>as more details emerge.</i>

52:19.771 --> 52:22.606
<i>In other news, Mayor Kane</i>
<i>made what has been described</i>

52:22.640 --> 52:25.343

<i>at Lennox Gardens.</i>

<i>to his redevelopment plan</i>

52:32.484 --> 52:35.420
<i>and makes a surprising</i>
<i>promise to the residents there.</i>

52:35.454 --> 52:38.656
Tom:
<i>Crime and racism</i>

52:38.690 --> 52:40.691
<i>stand in the way</i>
<i>of hope here.</i>

52:40.726 --> 52:43.027
<i>But we will</i>
<i>ovovercome them.</i>

52:43.561 --> 52:45.029
<i>Past mistakes</i>

52:45.063 --> 52:46.764
<i>will be corrected.</i>

52:46.798 --> 52:49.933
And the ground that
we're all standing on

52:50.668 --> 52:53.036
will be a good place
to live once more.

52:56.023 --> 52:57.990
You have my word.

53:09.769 --> 53:12.905
Lawsuit sign-ups
have slowed to a crawl.

53:12.939 --> 53:15.407
You turned it around.

53:15.441 --> 53:18.210
This is a pretty radical
move you're making.

53:18.244 --> 53:20.345
Can I ask what made you
change your mind?

53:21.380 --> 53:22.848
Does it matter?

53:23.382 --> 53:25.117
I suppose not.

53:26.819 --> 53:29.588
Larger question is
how we're gonna pay for it.

53:29.622 --> 53:31.490
There's a way.

53:31.524 --> 53:34.360
I always find one.

53:34.394 --> 53:37.296
Kenya Taylor's
already posted bail.

53:38.330 --> 53:40.633
But he's just one
obstacle.

53:40.667 --> 53:43.269
There are more, and not
just in Lennox Gardens.

53:43.303 --> 53:44.503
I am not done yet.

53:44.537 --> 53:47.840
I will remove
all obstructions.

53:47.874 --> 53:52.011
The thugs,
criminal and financial,

53:52.545 --> 53:54.547
have no idea
what's coming.

53:54.582 --> 53:57.517
Change according
to my will.

53:58.386 --> 54:00.654
We've got a lot to do,
you and I.

54:07.963 --> 54:09.697
I love you.

54:23.005 --> 54:25.446
I should go.

54:28.685 --> 54:30.619
See you tomorrow.

54:44.736 --> 54:47.805
What have you
done now, Tom?

54:47.839 --> 54:50.174
What have you done?
