00:01.041 --> 00:02.440
<i>Previously on Royal Pains...</i>

00:02.442 --> 00:04.008
Evan and I have reached an impasse.

00:04.010 --> 00:07.445
We've decided to suspend our partnership.

00:07.447 --> 00:08.980
I'm gonna keep Hankmed running

00:08.982 --> 00:10.681
with the help of my new doctor.

00:10.683 --> 00:12.784
I memorized the patients'
social security numbers.

00:12.786 --> 00:15.686
She's been offered a gig...
eight weeks in Stratford.

00:15.688 --> 00:17.188
- That's amazing!
- Oh, no, no, no.

00:17.190 --> 00:20.458
It's not Stratford, Connecticut.
It's Stratford-Upon-Avon.

00:20.460 --> 00:22.326
Don't you think that maybe
one of you should consult me

00:22.328 --> 00:23.661
about what I want?

00:23.663 --> 00:26.030
Of course we should.
Of course we should. Sorry.

00:26.032 --> 00:28.499
I've decided that I am going to work...

00:28.501 --> 00:30.034
For both of you.

00:30.036 --> 00:32.970
<i>- That's not a choice.
- That's not a choice.</i>

00:32.972 --> 00:34.472
My job fell through.

00:34.474 --> 00:36.541
They gave my position to someone else.

00:36.543 --> 00:39.110
Hank, I am so screwed.

00:41.000 --> 00:47.074
Learn the unknown words of this movie
--->   Skeebdo.com

00:48.620 --> 00:50.154
Hey. I am outside your house.

00:50.156 --> 00:52.723
I just heard what happened about your job.

00:52.725 --> 00:55.193
I bought cappuccinos if you want to talk.

00:55.195 --> 00:57.628
- No, no, that's great news.
- And there you are.

00:57.630 --> 00:59.897
Yes. Okay. Thank you.

00:59.899 --> 01:01.332
That was the foundation president,

01:01.334 --> 01:02.900
and he did give my job away.

01:02.902 --> 01:05.369
And this is making you happy because?

01:05.370 --> 01:07.939
Because he offered me
a bigger and better job.

01:07.941 --> 01:11.008
Divya, my dream job just got dreamier.

01:11.010 --> 01:12.643
Oh, yes!

01:12.645 --> 01:15.413
I'm gonna be traveling the world
developing outreach programs.

01:15.415 --> 01:18.416
At first I'll be in Botswana,
then after that South America,

01:18.418 --> 01:20.618
and then after that, who knows?

01:20.620 --> 01:22.820
- But I'm going global!
- Oh!

01:22.822 --> 01:26.791
Congratulations. So when do you leave?

01:26.793 --> 01:27.892
Tomorrow.

01:27.894 --> 01:29.093
Tomorrow?

01:29.095 --> 01:31.028
Yeah.

01:31.030 --> 01:32.930
Well, forget the cappuccinos.

01:32.932 --> 01:34.732
We are having celebratory champagne.

01:34.734 --> 01:37.602
It is cocktail hour... somewhere.

01:37.604 --> 01:40.171
All right. I'll get my purse.

01:40.173 --> 01:42.473
Hey! Favor.

01:42.475 --> 01:44.475
Can you not tell Hank about your job?

01:44.477 --> 01:46.544
Oh. So you decided to work with him.

01:46.546 --> 01:47.778
No.

01:47.780 --> 01:49.213
Okay. Uh, well,

01:49.215 --> 01:50.915
if you're gonna work with Evan, I...

01:50.917 --> 01:52.750
No. I'm not just working with Evan.

01:52.752 --> 01:55.653
If I choose one,
I'll alienate the other one.

01:55.655 --> 01:57.054
But if I stay on the inside
with both guys,

01:57.056 --> 01:59.790
then maybe I can fix
what's wrong between them.

01:59.792 --> 02:01.159
And how are you going to do that?

02:01.161 --> 02:03.594
I'm gonna sabotage them.

02:03.596 --> 02:04.762
But drinks first.

02:04.764 --> 02:07.598
Okay.

02:25.250 --> 02:27.151
My God...

02:28.387 --> 02:29.887
When did you get back?

02:29.889 --> 02:31.656
Late last night.

02:31.658 --> 02:34.592
- Why didn't you wake me up?
- I did.

02:34.594 --> 02:36.427
Whoa. I thought that was
just a really good dream.

02:36.429 --> 02:38.796
Like a really, really good dream.

02:38.798 --> 02:40.198
Didn't you say you weren't
getting a weekend off

02:40.200 --> 02:41.199
for another two weeks?

02:41.201 --> 02:43.834
Yeah, but...

02:43.836 --> 02:46.137
things kind of changed, and...

02:46.139 --> 02:47.705
That's great.

02:47.707 --> 02:50.308
And I wanna hear all about it.

02:50.310 --> 02:54.278
But first...

02:54.280 --> 02:57.148
Order waterproof brochures
to hand out at beach clubs.

02:57.150 --> 03:00.251
Sorry. If I don't record
my ideas right away...

03:00.253 --> 03:02.153
I've been losing them

03:02.155 --> 03:03.788
'cause I've been getting a lot of ideas.

03:03.790 --> 03:05.223
Yeah, I see that.

03:05.225 --> 03:08.226
Why is your office in your bedroom?

03:08.228 --> 03:09.694
Oh, 'cause it's my bunker.

03:09.696 --> 03:11.762
It's where I keep all my ideas

03:11.764 --> 03:13.397
that are for my eyes only, you know?

03:13.399 --> 03:15.333
But the only other eyes
around here are Hank's.

03:15.335 --> 03:16.834
Yeah. Exactly.

03:16.836 --> 03:18.369
I thought your split was amicable.

03:18.371 --> 03:20.738
You said you guys are happier
and better off.

03:20.740 --> 03:22.940
Yeah, we are. Absolutely.

03:22.942 --> 03:24.442
But he's still the competition,

03:24.444 --> 03:25.810
so...

03:25.812 --> 03:28.045
Let me just deal with this one text,

03:28.047 --> 03:32.183
then I wanna hear all about England.

03:32.185 --> 03:33.484
I had the same idea.

03:33.486 --> 03:35.052
Once I heard Uruguay fell through,

03:35.054 --> 03:36.621
I considered offering her a permanent job.

03:36.623 --> 03:37.922
Oh, I would do more than consider.

03:37.924 --> 03:39.290
I would jump at the opportunity.

03:39.292 --> 03:41.692
This could be the answer
to all of your trouble.

03:41.694 --> 03:43.094
I didn't realize I was in trouble.

03:43.096 --> 03:44.595
Oh, come on. Of course you did.

03:44.597 --> 03:46.130
I mean, you're low on money,

03:46.132 --> 03:48.366
and you know how hopeless you
are with all the business stuff.

03:48.368 --> 03:50.301
And there is so much of it.

03:50.303 --> 03:51.802
Right. Well, I figured I could handle...

03:51.804 --> 03:53.204
Hank, you're starting over again.

03:53.206 --> 03:54.672
I mean, with Jill you would
have a planner,

03:54.674 --> 03:56.173
a number cruncher,

03:56.175 --> 03:58.476
and a killer PR rep all in one.

03:58.478 --> 03:59.977
It's perfect!

03:59.979 --> 04:02.146
I really do need help,

04:02.148 --> 04:03.848
and she's the perfect person to...

04:24.469 --> 04:26.604
You should call Jill right away.

04:26.606 --> 04:29.640
- This could save your business.
- You don't think it's too soon?

04:29.642 --> 04:32.176
What? And let Evan scoop her up?

04:34.079 --> 04:37.081
Hey, Jill, hi.
I wanted to talk to you about

04:37.083 --> 04:39.483
giving me some badly needed help.

04:39.485 --> 04:42.687
Really? Africa?

04:42.689 --> 04:44.722
T... tomorrow?

04:44.724 --> 04:48.859
Wow. Uh, well, that's... that's... great.

04:48.861 --> 04:51.028
Me? No, no. Don't worry.

04:51.030 --> 04:53.497
I'll be fine. I'm in trouble.

05:14.946 --> 05:18.946

Sync and corrections by atrn97g
for www. addic7ed. com

05:24.720 --> 05:27.555
Okay, so nausea, cramping,

05:27.557 --> 05:28.889
anything else?

05:31.060 --> 05:32.526
Abdominal distress.

05:32.528 --> 05:34.161
What's with the new phone number?

05:34.163 --> 05:35.696
You being sued?

05:35.698 --> 05:37.665
If there's something wrong
with you as a doctor,

05:37.667 --> 05:39.867
- I need to know.
- I... I'm not being sued, okay?

05:39.869 --> 05:41.535
Evan and I have just decided

05:41.537 --> 05:43.203
to go our separate medical business ways.

05:43.205 --> 05:45.873
Oh, I totally get it.
I had to fire my brother once.

05:45.875 --> 05:48.542
- That's not easy.
- I didn't fire Evan.

05:48.544 --> 05:50.077
Yeah, that's what I said
in the beginning too.

05:50.079 --> 05:53.147
- But business is business.
- I wanna check your abdomen.

05:53.149 --> 05:55.849
- Hey, now.
- Yeah, I know.

05:55.851 --> 05:57.618
Weren't you one of
the hairy guys growing up?

05:57.620 --> 05:58.953
Yeah. Is that even relevant

05:58.955 --> 06:00.020
when you got a patient at death's door?

06:00.022 --> 06:01.388
You're not at death's door, okay?

06:01.390 --> 06:03.691
You're not even in death's zip code.

06:06.328 --> 06:08.495
- Are you on any new medications?
- No.

06:08.497 --> 06:09.863
- Just prednisone.
- That's not a "just. "

06:09.865 --> 06:11.932
How long have you been taking it?

06:11.934 --> 06:13.701
I don't know, off an on,
like a few months.

06:13.703 --> 06:15.302
I had a little rash.

06:15.304 --> 06:16.904
A rash. From what?

06:16.906 --> 06:18.572
Fine. It's from manscaping. I get waxed.

06:18.574 --> 06:20.808
Is that okay?

06:20.810 --> 06:22.543
I'm sorry. Was I supposed to answer that?

06:22.545 --> 06:23.877
It's for the ladies, Hank.

06:23.879 --> 06:26.513
Clean and smooth like a sexy porpoise.

06:26.515 --> 06:28.849
- Get with the times, Hank.
- Yeah.

06:28.851 --> 06:30.985
I'm gonna take some blood.
Long-term prednisone use

06:30.987 --> 06:32.553
can compromise your immune system...

06:32.555 --> 06:36.056
hang on. Hold that thought.

06:36.058 --> 06:38.058
Sexy porpoise?

06:50.505 --> 06:53.741
Divya Katdare, meet Dr. Jeremiah Sacani.

06:53.743 --> 06:56.010
Oh, you're the P.A. You're from the U.K.

06:56.012 --> 06:57.578
I read your C.V.

06:57.580 --> 07:01.281
Your face is unusually symmetrical.

07:01.283 --> 07:02.449
Thank you?

07:02.451 --> 07:04.585
Okay.

07:04.587 --> 07:08.489
Uh, so... Hankmed 2.0 staff meeting begins.

07:08.491 --> 07:09.690
Are there assigned seats?

07:09.692 --> 07:10.991
Anywhere is fine.

07:10.993 --> 07:13.027
- Except for there.
- Oh.

07:13.029 --> 07:16.130
I'm just kidding.
That's... hazing the new guy.

07:17.566 --> 07:19.800
But seriously, is it okay if I sit here?

07:22.470 --> 07:24.071
So Jeremiah,

07:24.073 --> 07:25.939
since this is your first day
seeing patients,

07:25.941 --> 07:28.075
I prepared an excellent
introductory day for you.

07:28.077 --> 07:30.778
Three retainer clients.
Should be a piece of cake.

07:30.780 --> 07:32.713
Plus I'll be with you the whole time, so...

07:32.715 --> 07:34.381
Did you bring those
patient cards I prepared?

07:34.383 --> 07:36.316
- Yes. Right here.
- Wonderful.

07:36.318 --> 07:38.419
Uh, will I get these for all the patients?

07:38.421 --> 07:40.854
Of course. Yeah.

07:42.590 --> 07:44.091
Prepare patient cards for everyone.

07:44.093 --> 07:45.526
Evan.

07:45.528 --> 07:48.762
Did you not get my text
about the retainer meeting?

07:48.764 --> 07:50.397
- The what?
- I got a call this morning

07:50.399 --> 07:52.700
from Sidney Bartlett's office
at The Blackstone?

07:52.702 --> 07:54.134
The Blackstone?

07:54.136 --> 07:55.903
I've been trying to get in there forever.

07:55.905 --> 07:58.072
I know. They had
a cancellation this morning

07:58.074 --> 07:59.940
at 10:00 A. M... It is
the last available half hour

07:59.942 --> 08:01.675
- for the next two months.
- What?

08:01.677 --> 08:04.511
How am I supposed to meet
Bartlett and go with Jeremiah?

08:04.513 --> 08:05.979
I can go with him.

08:05.981 --> 08:09.083
You said yourself it was a piece of cake.

08:14.389 --> 08:17.991
This isn't on the schedule,
and I don't have a patient card.

08:17.993 --> 08:20.561
Dr. Sacani, sometimes emergencies happen.

08:20.563 --> 08:23.097
The spa owner called, and here we are.

08:23.099 --> 08:25.699
That is the thrill of concierge medicine.

08:25.701 --> 08:29.036
Every day, something unexpected happens.

08:29.038 --> 08:31.572
- Every day?
- You'll be fine.

08:32.607 --> 08:35.442
...ish.

08:40.448 --> 08:41.815
Hey, you.

08:41.817 --> 08:43.517
Hey. Thanks for coming.

08:43.519 --> 08:46.587
Yeah, of course.

08:46.589 --> 08:50.224
So, um... where's the clinic patient?

08:50.226 --> 08:51.391
What, no small talk?

08:51.393 --> 08:52.659
Is that what you lured me here for?

08:52.661 --> 08:54.862
Maybe. I can be sneaky like that.

08:54.864 --> 08:56.930
Yes, you can.

08:56.932 --> 08:58.632
His name is Jake, and he should
be here any minute.

08:58.634 --> 08:59.833
He's my delivery guy.

08:59.835 --> 09:02.102
He was here earlier,
and he looked terrible.

09:02.104 --> 09:04.037
Said he was aching all over.

09:04.039 --> 09:06.440
He's a really nice guy and...

09:06.442 --> 09:07.775
he's new on the job, so...

09:07.777 --> 09:10.210
- He doesn't have insurance yet.
- I know.

09:10.212 --> 09:11.678
Always asking you for favors.

09:11.680 --> 09:13.680
I'm only sorry
it's the last one you'll ask.

09:13.682 --> 09:15.449
- Still have 12 hours.
- Hey, Jill.

09:15.451 --> 09:17.618
You got something else for me?

09:17.620 --> 09:20.187
Yeah, I do. Jake, this is Dr. Lawson.

09:20.189 --> 09:22.122
Hank. Nice to meet you.

09:22.124 --> 09:23.957
Jill, this is why
you brought me over here?

09:23.959 --> 09:25.559
Yeah. She can be sneaky like that.

09:25.561 --> 09:28.362
Anyway, I'm gonna go see my family.

09:28.364 --> 09:29.963
- Okay.
- Hang out.

09:29.965 --> 09:31.865
And I will see you
at 7:00 at Chewy's, okay?

09:31.867 --> 09:34.535
- Yes, you will.
- You're in good hands.

09:34.537 --> 09:36.436
Chewy's got the best clams.

09:36.438 --> 09:38.238
Jake, when did you quit smoking?

09:38.240 --> 09:40.808
You're good, you're good.
How did you know that?

09:40.810 --> 09:42.776
Well... you're wearing a patch.

09:42.778 --> 09:44.745
Oh, yeah. Right.

09:44.747 --> 09:46.113
I quit about a month ago.

09:46.115 --> 09:48.148
Started eating better. I met a girl.

09:48.150 --> 09:50.017
- She must be pretty special.
- Special enough

09:50.019 --> 09:52.319
for me to get my first real job for her.

09:52.321 --> 09:54.955
Making submarine sandwiches
isn't exactly a career,

09:54.957 --> 09:56.490
you know? But this job's gone benefits,

09:56.492 --> 09:58.559
and I'm not just talking about
the dope uniform.

09:58.561 --> 10:00.594
All right. Uh...

10:02.030 --> 10:03.397
you're running a fever,

10:03.399 --> 10:05.666
and Jill told me you were achy all over.

10:05.668 --> 10:07.434
Is your neck stiff?

10:07.436 --> 10:09.403
Yeah, but it's probably
just from sleeping in the truck.

10:09.405 --> 10:11.939
I'm, you know, kinda between
couches right now.

10:11.941 --> 10:13.373
Okay. I wanna make sure
you don't have meningitis,

10:13.375 --> 10:15.042
and I think you should find a real bed.

10:15.044 --> 10:17.511
You need to rest.
Uniform won't do its magic

10:17.513 --> 10:19.680
if you're not well enough to wear it.

10:19.682 --> 10:20.814
Okay.

10:30.659 --> 10:32.559
Hi. Thank you for coming so quickly.

10:32.561 --> 10:34.127
I wanted to call an ambulance,

10:34.129 --> 10:35.562
but my client wouldn't hear of it.

10:35.564 --> 10:36.930
The woman's a diva.

10:36.932 --> 10:38.832
We work quite well
with a demanding patient.

10:38.834 --> 10:41.101
Oh, no, no, no. She's an actual diva.

10:41.103 --> 10:42.336
- Francesca Bragalini.
- The soprano?

10:42.338 --> 10:43.670
She's complaining of her heart racing,

10:43.672 --> 10:45.606
and she's having difficulty breathing.

10:45.608 --> 10:47.941
Oh.

10:51.646 --> 10:54.314
Ms. Bragalini, I'm Divya Katdare,

10:54.316 --> 10:55.816
and this is Dr. Sacani.

10:55.818 --> 10:57.885
I told Annika I'm fine

10:57.887 --> 11:02.256
and that I didn't want my
ionization therapy interrupted.

11:02.258 --> 11:04.825
Lean forward, please.

11:06.761 --> 11:08.629
Deep breath.

11:18.606 --> 11:20.307
How long have you had CHF?

11:20.309 --> 11:23.510
Did Annika tell you
I have a heart condition?

11:23.512 --> 11:25.245
No, the swelling in your ankles

11:25.247 --> 11:26.780
and the crackles in your lungs did.

11:26.782 --> 11:29.449
- Plus, you're morbidly obese.
- Excuse me?

11:29.451 --> 11:32.185
Dr. Sacani,
why would you say such a thing?

11:32.187 --> 11:34.288
Because her BMI is clearly
in excess of 40.

11:34.290 --> 11:37.357
I am so sorry.
It was an inappropriate comment.

11:37.359 --> 11:38.859
Please forgive us.

11:38.861 --> 11:42.262
You're very direct, Dr. Sacani.

11:42.264 --> 11:44.298
Well... yes.

11:44.300 --> 11:47.234
I don't like it.

11:47.236 --> 11:48.602
Okay. Uh...

11:48.604 --> 11:50.270
I'd still like to draw some blood

11:50.272 --> 11:52.973
and do a test X-ray,
if that's at all possib... whoops!

11:52.975 --> 11:54.141
Ms. Bragalini?

11:54.143 --> 11:56.443
Dr. Sacani, she has no pulse.

11:56.445 --> 11:57.878
Let's lower the chair back.
I'll start CPR.

11:57.880 --> 11:59.680
Call 911.

12:07.352 --> 12:08.685
- She has an ICD.
- Uh-huh.

12:08.687 --> 12:10.887
I saw.

12:10.889 --> 12:12.188
Sudden defibrillation. Wait.

12:12.190 --> 12:13.556
She said she was having
ionization therapy.

12:13.558 --> 12:15.892
Are there magnets in that blanket?

12:18.095 --> 12:20.196
- They're woven into the fabric.
- They deactivated her ICD.

12:20.198 --> 12:22.265
If the blanket deactivated it,
it can restart it.

12:25.403 --> 12:27.470
Hello.

12:27.472 --> 12:28.905
You've had an arrhythmia episode.

12:28.907 --> 12:30.440
Just let your head back.

12:30.442 --> 12:31.875
The same blanket

12:31.877 --> 12:33.910
that deactivated Francesca's defibrillator

12:33.912 --> 12:36.279
was then used to reactivate it?

12:36.281 --> 12:38.081
Yes. It sensed the arrhythmia

12:38.083 --> 12:39.783
and shocked her heart back to normal.

12:39.785 --> 12:41.084
I'm just so glad she's okay,

12:41.086 --> 12:42.685
and I'm very lucky that you were here.

12:42.687 --> 12:44.687
Ms. Bergman, have you ever considered

12:44.689 --> 12:46.489
adding an in-house doctor

12:46.491 --> 12:48.057
to the services that your spa offers?

12:48.059 --> 12:49.559
That's actually a great idea.

12:49.561 --> 12:51.294
Is it something you might
be interested in?

12:51.296 --> 12:53.463
Actually, I'm a physician
assistant, not a doctor.

12:53.465 --> 12:55.165
Well, if you can think of a physician

12:55.167 --> 12:57.233
that might be interested,
I would love to get a name.

12:57.235 --> 12:59.335
How about two?

13:01.539 --> 13:03.706
Divya.

13:03.708 --> 13:06.276
The Blackstone
had no record of my meeting.

13:06.278 --> 13:08.244
Who did you talk to?
Did you check your notes?

13:08.246 --> 13:09.546
- Sit.
- What?

13:09.548 --> 13:13.550
Sit.

13:13.552 --> 13:15.685
I didn't have time

13:15.687 --> 13:18.188
because something huge came along.

13:18.190 --> 13:20.256
Okay.

13:20.258 --> 13:24.027
Posh spa is considering
hiring an in-house doctor.

13:24.029 --> 13:26.095
Finger.

13:27.898 --> 13:30.700
It could be an endless
stream of potential new clients.

13:30.702 --> 13:32.335
That is huge.

13:32.337 --> 13:34.304
Remove finger.

13:35.573 --> 13:36.639
Does Hank know?

13:36.641 --> 13:39.309
A spa? You know Hank.

13:39.311 --> 13:41.644
He is not interested
in that type of thing.

13:41.646 --> 13:44.347
I've got you an interview
for tomorrow morning.

13:44.349 --> 13:46.916
- Can you be ready that fast?
- I'm ready right now.

13:46.918 --> 13:48.184
Hey, Divs, you got a minute?

13:48.186 --> 13:49.385
- I need your opinion.
- Sure.

13:49.387 --> 13:50.753
Don't touch.

13:53.224 --> 13:55.525
Learn everything about
medical spas by tomorrow,

13:55.527 --> 13:58.127
but first buy Jill a going-away present.

13:58.129 --> 13:59.295
Oh, yeah.

14:00.664 --> 14:02.665
It's not my kind of medicine.

14:02.667 --> 14:04.501
Hank, why presume that?

14:04.503 --> 14:05.969
Annika's looking for a doctor

14:05.971 --> 14:08.338
to come in and tell her what
type of medicine they could do.

14:08.340 --> 14:10.907
Look, I appreciate it,
Divya, but it's just not for me.

14:10.909 --> 14:12.942
- Really?
- Really.

14:12.944 --> 14:14.444
That is too bad.

14:14.446 --> 14:17.180
It would have been a godsend,
considering your predicament.

14:17.182 --> 14:18.515
Mm. This one.

14:27.725 --> 14:29.192
Okay.

14:31.095 --> 14:32.896
Hank you didn't have to get me anything.

14:32.898 --> 14:34.531
Oh, okay, then I'll just put it down...

14:34.533 --> 14:36.933
wait, give it to me.

14:38.769 --> 14:40.136
It's nothing big, just...

14:40.138 --> 14:42.739
a little something to remind you of us.

14:48.345 --> 14:50.146
Our clinic.

14:50.148 --> 14:51.948
Your clinic.

14:51.950 --> 14:54.484
I wanted you to remember
how many people you've helped

14:54.486 --> 14:58.154
and how much people around here
care for you.

14:58.156 --> 15:00.523
Especially the three of us.

15:05.763 --> 15:08.264
It's perfect. Thank you.

15:10.301 --> 15:12.769
This is from me.

15:23.247 --> 15:25.715
Divya.

15:25.717 --> 15:27.850
It's beautiful.

15:31.221 --> 15:33.356
So we'll always be close to your heart.

15:33.358 --> 15:35.458
I love it.

15:35.460 --> 15:36.893
Thank you.

15:36.895 --> 15:40.330
I'm so excited
for what you're about to do.

15:41.966 --> 15:44.067
But I'm gonna miss you.

15:44.069 --> 15:46.736
I'm gonna miss you too, girl.

15:48.572 --> 15:51.140
Oh. Okay. I really...

15:51.142 --> 15:52.909
I really hate good-byes.

15:52.911 --> 15:55.011
Well,

15:55.013 --> 15:56.312
guess what, Jill.

15:56.314 --> 15:58.381
- What, Evan?
- This...

15:58.383 --> 16:00.016
is about to make you feel a lot better.

16:00.018 --> 16:03.252
Now, where they went sentimental with it,

16:03.254 --> 16:04.988
I decided to go practical.

16:04.990 --> 16:08.091
"What do you get the girl who's
going to the middle of Africa?"

16:08.093 --> 16:10.193
One might ask.

16:10.195 --> 16:13.029
And the answer might be... In that bag.

16:13.031 --> 16:15.431
- That's you.
- I see.

16:18.002 --> 16:19.602
Oh! Oh, wow.

16:19.604 --> 16:23.006
<i>The traveler's bed bug thwarting cocoon.</i>

16:23.008 --> 16:24.907
It doesn't just stop beg bugs either.

16:24.909 --> 16:27.043
- It's pretty awesome, right?
- It is totally awesome

16:27.045 --> 16:28.911
and totally you.

16:28.913 --> 16:30.813
Thank you, Evan.

16:36.520 --> 16:39.255
Help me clear the table.

16:39.257 --> 16:40.456
Why would...

16:41.792 --> 16:43.359
right.

16:43.361 --> 16:45.194
'Scuse me.

16:46.263 --> 16:48.364
- You mind if I, uh...
- Yeah.

16:54.038 --> 16:55.638
I was so almost gonna get you

16:55.640 --> 16:58.908
<i>the traveler's bed bug
thwarting sleeping cocoon.</i>

16:58.910 --> 17:01.310
It was that or the photo
album, and I just...

17:01.312 --> 17:02.912
I don't know. I wanted the photo album.

17:02.914 --> 17:05.248
- Good choice.
- Thank you.

17:08.719 --> 17:11.220
I'm really, really gonna miss you.

17:11.222 --> 17:14.390
I'm gonna miss you too.

17:14.392 --> 17:15.858
I wanted to thank you

17:15.859 --> 17:18.861
for giving me a reason
to stay in the Hamptons.

17:18.863 --> 17:21.864
I never would have made
the leap without you.

17:24.001 --> 17:27.537
You know, Hank, I...

17:27.539 --> 17:29.639
I never would have made
this leap without you.

17:29.641 --> 17:31.340
Up until last summer,

17:31.342 --> 17:36.379
I was the local girl who had
never left the Hamptons.

17:36.381 --> 17:39.582
And now... look at me.

17:39.584 --> 17:41.451
Tomorrow, I'll be in Africa.

17:41.453 --> 17:43.820
Can't get to Africa
without a ride to the airport.

17:43.822 --> 17:45.154
No.

17:45.156 --> 17:47.123
No, that won't be necessary.

17:47.125 --> 17:48.958
I know it won't. I want to.

17:48.960 --> 17:51.227
We can do small talk all the way to JFK.

17:54.064 --> 17:55.231
Okay.

17:55.233 --> 17:57.433
- Want to, uh, try it on?
- Yes.

17:57.435 --> 17:59.035
- Make sure it fits?
- I do.

17:59.037 --> 18:00.737
- Yes.
- Okay.

18:04.975 --> 18:06.943
All right. Come on in.

18:15.819 --> 18:17.620
It's beautiful.

18:29.066 --> 18:31.200
Okay. Okay.

18:31.202 --> 18:32.735
Okay.

18:32.737 --> 18:35.238
- Midnight snack.
- Hmm?

18:35.240 --> 18:38.441
Whoa, no, no. Give me five minutes, babe.

18:38.443 --> 18:42.078
There you are.

18:49.086 --> 18:52.054
So... what's all this?

18:53.558 --> 18:55.458
Divya, what's up?

18:55.460 --> 18:57.660
- This, Divya...
- Uh, Divya?

18:57.662 --> 19:00.830
Is a five-part multimedia presentation.

19:00.832 --> 19:02.431
- This is a great opportunity.
- Mm-hmm.

19:02.433 --> 19:04.767
The spa will generate business
all by itself.

19:04.769 --> 19:07.403
To be honest, I am so surprised

19:07.405 --> 19:09.906
that Hank didn't want to go for it.

19:09.908 --> 19:11.908
Oh, yeah? I'm not.

19:11.910 --> 19:14.076
Let me tell you something
about my brother, Divya.

19:14.078 --> 19:17.013
He has no vision.

19:17.015 --> 19:19.315
At all. He's vision-impaired.

19:19.317 --> 19:21.684
My brother would not know a gold mine

19:21.686 --> 19:25.188
if he tripped over a prospector
and fell into a gold mine.

19:25.190 --> 19:27.356
- Be nice.
- I am being nice.

19:27.358 --> 19:29.759
Look... when I get this job,

19:29.761 --> 19:31.861
I'm not gonna tell him I told him so.

19:31.863 --> 19:34.397
But he'll know. And I'll know.

19:34.399 --> 19:36.232
And he'll know that I know that he knows.

19:36.234 --> 19:37.366
You know?

19:37.368 --> 19:38.868
The point is,

19:38.870 --> 19:42.171
this spa is the future, and it's all mine.

19:42.173 --> 19:44.440
It's all mine.

19:46.977 --> 19:49.045
Bogey at 2:00.

19:49.047 --> 19:51.647
Hey, guys. What's going on?

19:51.649 --> 19:53.382
Uh...

19:53.384 --> 19:55.685
nothing, Hank. Just Hankmed business.

19:55.687 --> 19:57.353
Hankmed business.

19:57.355 --> 19:59.255
Hankmed.

20:03.827 --> 20:05.194
Uh, Divya,

20:05.196 --> 20:08.798
that, uh, that spa thing
we were talking about...

20:08.800 --> 20:10.533
I've been thinking about it.

20:10.535 --> 20:13.035
There may be something there.

20:13.037 --> 20:15.438
Yeah. I'm in.

20:17.975 --> 20:20.343
Good for you, Henry. That's great.

20:20.345 --> 20:21.844
Thanks, man. It feels good.

20:21.846 --> 20:23.980
I guess I could introduce the both of you.

20:23.982 --> 20:25.681
That'd be awesome.

20:25.683 --> 20:27.350
Yeah. That would be so cool.

20:42.366 --> 20:45.034
Are you spying on Evan for Hank?

20:45.036 --> 20:48.704
- Excuse me?
- I saw you use your phone.

20:48.706 --> 20:50.606
And then Hank came downstairs,

20:50.608 --> 20:52.441
and now he's going after the spa.

20:52.443 --> 20:56.045
I promise you, I am not spying on Evan.

20:56.047 --> 20:57.446
So what are you doing?

20:57.448 --> 20:59.682
What am I doing?

20:59.684 --> 21:02.752
- Yeah. What are you doing?
- Well...

21:02.754 --> 21:04.520
Well?

21:04.522 --> 21:07.089
Well, indeed.

21:07.091 --> 21:09.625
You're trying
to undermine Evan, aren't you?

21:09.627 --> 21:12.094
Okay, the truth is

21:12.096 --> 21:15.164
I am not trying to undermine Evan.

21:15.166 --> 21:18.134
I'm trying to undermine both of them.

21:18.136 --> 21:20.136
Why would you do that?

21:20.138 --> 21:22.772
Because if I can make them
both fail separately,

21:22.774 --> 21:24.807
then they will realize
that they need each other,

21:24.809 --> 21:27.276
and then everything, finally,

21:27.278 --> 21:28.878
will get back to normal.

21:28.880 --> 21:31.781
Ohh! Please do it fast.
Whatever it takes, Divya.

21:31.783 --> 21:33.549
Just... I really miss old Evan.

21:33.551 --> 21:34.550
- Okay.
- Okay.

21:34.552 --> 21:37.586
I got it.

21:41.325 --> 21:43.459
Breathe in and out.

21:43.461 --> 21:45.094
Lawson...

21:45.096 --> 21:46.362
what am I paying you for?
I feel worse, not better.

21:46.364 --> 21:48.431
Again.

21:48.433 --> 21:50.199
All right. Your white count is elevated,

21:50.201 --> 21:52.268
and you have a fever,
and that concerns me,

21:52.270 --> 21:54.103
so I'm gonna take a blood sample.

21:54.105 --> 21:56.105
Well, that concerns me 'cause
you already took some blood.

21:56.107 --> 21:57.974
I wanna take a urine sample
and a chest X-ray.

21:57.976 --> 22:00.076
In the meantime,
since you may not be viral,

22:00.078 --> 22:01.610
I'll give you an antibiotic.

22:01.612 --> 22:03.212
Fine. How long before your office calls me

22:03.214 --> 22:05.514
- with the results?
- Um...

22:05.516 --> 22:07.283
You don't have an office, do you?

22:07.285 --> 22:09.685
Hank, you can't run a business
without infrastructure.

22:09.687 --> 22:11.187
Being a great doctor is not enough.

22:11.189 --> 22:12.288
It's worked so far.

22:12.290 --> 22:13.522
Yeah, but now you got competition.

22:13.524 --> 22:15.124
It's a whole new ball game. Listen to me.

22:15.126 --> 22:17.126
I know we've always competed.

22:17.128 --> 22:18.361
Maybe it's time we joined forces.

22:18.363 --> 22:20.296
I've been very successful, Hank.

22:20.298 --> 22:22.198
Let me invest in you,
and then maybe you'll know

22:22.200 --> 22:23.799
what it's like to be on the winning team.

22:23.801 --> 22:25.701
Listen, Keller, not everything
in life is a competition.

22:25.703 --> 22:27.436
Right. That's what losers always say.

22:27.438 --> 22:28.938
- Okay.
- Look, you got rid

22:28.940 --> 22:30.473
of the deadweight.
The monkey's off your back.

22:30.475 --> 22:31.707
Actually, the monkey, my brother,

22:31.709 --> 22:33.009
has evolved quite a lot.

22:33.011 --> 22:34.977
Well, then,
all the more reason to team up.

22:34.979 --> 22:37.346
If I were him, I'd want
to beat you so... so bad.

22:37.348 --> 22:39.448
Really?

22:39.450 --> 22:40.783
Look, what do you say? You and me.

22:40.785 --> 22:42.385
- We go all the way.
- Okay, thanks.

22:42.387 --> 22:43.853
But I'm not interested.

22:43.855 --> 22:45.287
Now, I don't mean to rush you,

22:45.289 --> 22:47.256
but I'm giving someone
a ride to the airport,

22:47.258 --> 22:49.325
so fill this up all the way.

22:49.327 --> 22:52.661
Thank you.

23:03.206 --> 23:04.774
Oh, my Go...

23:04.776 --> 23:06.108
- Sorry.
- No, no, it's okay.

23:06.110 --> 23:07.610
You just... just startled me.

23:07.612 --> 23:11.447
Wow, Jeremiah.

23:11.449 --> 23:14.316
You know, I'm actually busy all day today.

23:14.318 --> 23:17.553
So just assume Divya
will call you if she needs you,

23:17.555 --> 23:21.123
and go do whatever it is you do
when you're not working.

23:21.125 --> 23:24.894
Like a hobby.

23:24.896 --> 23:26.796
Or not.

23:26.798 --> 23:28.364
I have time now

23:28.366 --> 23:30.833
for that long story
that you never told me.

23:30.835 --> 23:33.736
Why you and Hank aren't working together.

23:37.607 --> 23:40.743
Um, basically we wanted
two different Hankmeds.

23:40.745 --> 23:42.311
That's all. And now my Hankmed

23:42.313 --> 23:44.413
is the one I've always wanted.

23:44.415 --> 23:46.482
Yeah.

23:46.484 --> 23:49.585
Just never thought
I'd have it all to myself.

23:49.587 --> 23:52.455
Is it maybe like f... finding out

23:52.457 --> 23:54.123
that someone you thought hated you

23:54.125 --> 23:55.624
really loved you...

23:55.626 --> 23:58.494
But finding out too late?

23:58.496 --> 24:00.262
Did that happen to you?

24:00.264 --> 24:03.265
Yes. That's why I left my last job

24:03.267 --> 24:05.534
and how I ended up in this one.

24:05.536 --> 24:08.237
As you might have noticed,
I'm not good with people.

24:08.239 --> 24:10.206
Or meeting people.

24:10.208 --> 24:13.843
Or, uh, in... in meetings with people.

24:13.845 --> 24:15.578
- Well...
- It's new territory for me,

24:15.580 --> 24:19.715
and it's quite, uh, quite scary.

24:19.717 --> 24:22.852
New territory can be that way.

24:22.854 --> 24:24.587
We're bonding now, aren't we?

24:24.589 --> 24:25.988
Yeah. I guess we are.

24:27.324 --> 24:30.025
- Should we hug?
- Next time.

24:38.068 --> 24:39.735
Jill?

24:42.272 --> 24:44.240
Jill?

24:56.219 --> 24:58.721
Bye, Jill.

25:00.502 --> 25:02.202
Just be yourself.

25:02.204 --> 25:05.372
Stick to the merits
of your healthy lifestyle ideas.

25:05.374 --> 25:07.374
And do not get negative or confrontational

25:07.376 --> 25:09.009
about anything they might expect.

25:09.011 --> 25:10.243
Like what?

25:10.245 --> 25:12.045
Like botoxing the soles of women's feet

25:12.047 --> 25:14.381
to mask the pain from 8-inch heels.

25:14.383 --> 25:16.016
Or putting filler into an eight-year-old

25:16.018 --> 25:17.250
pageant contestant's face.

25:17.252 --> 25:19.152
Nobody really does that.

25:19.154 --> 25:20.654
Of course they do. But don't worry.

25:20.656 --> 25:21.855
It probably won't come up.

25:21.857 --> 25:23.490
- Divya, hi!
- Hi.

25:23.492 --> 25:24.991
And you must be Dr. Lawson.

25:24.993 --> 25:27.327
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

25:27.329 --> 25:28.828
- And please, call me Hank.
- Great.

25:28.830 --> 25:30.597
The conference room
is down here on your right.

25:30.599 --> 25:32.599
You can go ahead and set up
your presentation in there.

25:32.601 --> 25:34.801
Ah. Yes. I don't have a presentation.

25:34.803 --> 25:36.002
Oh!

25:36.004 --> 25:38.171
Okay. Then I will just
review your prospectus.

25:38.173 --> 25:40.840
Oh. Well, I don't have
one of those either.

25:40.842 --> 25:42.209
Oh! Terrific.

25:42.211 --> 25:45.011
Okay. Then we will just,
um, have a chat then.

25:45.013 --> 25:48.848
- Great. Sounds good.
- Okay.

25:48.850 --> 25:50.584
I'm so sorry.

25:59.795 --> 26:01.595
Hey! How did it go?

26:01.597 --> 26:02.929
I don't think she found my ideas

26:02.931 --> 26:04.931
for preventative medicine very sexy.

26:04.933 --> 26:07.033
Well, I wouldn't worry.
I'm sure you did fine.

26:07.035 --> 26:08.602
Thank you.

26:08.604 --> 26:11.538
Oh, look. There's Evan.

26:11.540 --> 26:14.107
Let me guess. Your... presentation.

26:14.109 --> 26:15.242
Hi, Henry.

26:15.244 --> 26:17.444
P, p, p, p, p.

26:17.446 --> 26:19.012
"Proper preparation
prevents poor performance. "

26:19.014 --> 26:20.880
- How was your interview?
- Good.

26:20.882 --> 26:22.249
- Great. See ya.
- Good luck.

26:22.251 --> 26:24.117
Don't need it.

26:24.119 --> 26:26.720
- Good-bye.
- Could you hold that... oh.

26:33.729 --> 26:36.630
Please say he's here for
the Indian ocean seaweed wrap.

26:36.632 --> 26:38.932
Oh, he's here for you.

26:38.934 --> 26:40.934
You said that you wanted a doctor.

26:40.936 --> 26:43.270
I said Van Dyke, Divya. Van Dyke.

26:43.272 --> 26:44.471
He couldn't make it.

26:44.473 --> 26:46.406
Oh, boy.

26:46.408 --> 26:48.341
Hey, listen, Jeremiah.

26:48.343 --> 26:51.945
Listen, buddy, I'm not
gonna need you for this one.

26:51.947 --> 26:53.513
Thanks for coming.

26:53.515 --> 26:56.182
It's nothing you did
or anything, it's just... it's...

26:56.184 --> 26:57.651
Oh.

26:57.653 --> 26:59.219
The sound of running water

26:59.221 --> 27:01.354
can activate the urinary response.

27:01.356 --> 27:02.889
- Mr. Lawson.
- Hello!

27:02.891 --> 27:04.357
And I see you brought
your colleague along.

27:04.359 --> 27:05.859
That's right. You remember Dr. Sacani.

27:05.861 --> 27:07.494
Oh, how could I forget someone

27:07.496 --> 27:09.696
who called one of my most
loyal clients obese?

27:11.266 --> 27:13.266
I'm sorry. Morbidly obese.

27:13.268 --> 27:14.934
He did save her though, right?

27:14.936 --> 27:16.469
Yes. And now the fat lady can sing.

27:16.471 --> 27:18.138
- No, no. Okay.
- Again.

27:18.140 --> 27:20.573
Wow. Okay, why don't we
go ahead and get started?

27:20.575 --> 27:22.042
I don't have that much time.

27:22.044 --> 27:24.811
Great. Doctor, after you.

27:41.296 --> 27:43.430
Jake?

27:43.432 --> 27:45.865
Jake.

27:45.867 --> 27:47.334
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:47.336 --> 27:50.637
Ohh...

27:50.639 --> 27:52.572
Jill said to call if it got worse.

27:52.574 --> 27:53.973
Got worse.

27:56.278 --> 27:58.645
I... I...

28:02.717 --> 28:04.317
You're running a high fever again.

28:04.319 --> 28:06.720
It's not by choice... I took
those antibiotics you gave me.

28:06.722 --> 28:08.488
Okay, this may be an atypical pneumonia.

28:08.490 --> 28:10.724
That's why you're not responding
to the beta lactam.

28:10.726 --> 28:12.525
It's also why you're not getting better.

28:12.527 --> 28:14.127
Here.

28:14.129 --> 28:15.762
Cough and spit for me, please.

28:18.399 --> 28:21.167
And it would explain why there's
now blood in your sputum.

28:21.169 --> 28:22.869
We need to get you to the hospital.

28:30.544 --> 28:32.712
Divya! Divya, this is bad.

28:32.714 --> 28:34.481
Your plan is not working.

28:34.483 --> 28:36.916
Don't tell me one of them
actually got the posh account.

28:36.918 --> 28:38.318
Worse. Annika called

28:38.320 --> 28:40.820
and said they were both on the short list.

28:40.822 --> 28:42.922
In fact, they are the short list.

28:42.924 --> 28:44.657
Annika said my healthy lifestyle ideas

28:44.659 --> 28:46.626
were refreshingly candid.

28:48.729 --> 28:50.096
That's awesome.

28:50.098 --> 28:52.832
She said that my 24-7 concierge component

28:52.834 --> 28:55.068
was impressive, so...

28:55.070 --> 28:56.569
Candid, impressive?

28:56.571 --> 28:58.538
I think we know who wins that one.

28:58.540 --> 29:00.940
And speaking of winning,
seven-ball, side pocket.

29:00.942 --> 29:03.042
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

29:03.044 --> 29:04.210
Hey, did you hear the best news ever?

29:04.212 --> 29:05.945
I did, indeed.

29:05.947 --> 29:09.482
I thought that Annika
didn't spark to your ideas.

29:09.484 --> 29:12.519
Yeah, apparently she warmed up
to my healthy lifestyle ideas.

29:12.521 --> 29:14.921
Plus, I made it clear
that she has the business mind.

29:14.923 --> 29:17.157
All she really needs is a doctor.

29:17.159 --> 29:19.426
Four-ball, corner pocket.

29:19.428 --> 29:20.760
Ohh, yeah!

29:20.762 --> 29:22.395
You didn't call that combination.

29:22.397 --> 29:24.764
- Because it was implied.
- Next time, imply it out loud.

29:24.766 --> 29:25.865
The balls were next to each other.

29:25.867 --> 29:27.000
Call your shots.

29:27.002 --> 29:28.601
It was touching the other ball.

29:28.603 --> 29:30.170
So how did you manage
to turn your interview around?

29:30.172 --> 29:33.573
Especially after that rocky
start with Dr. Sacani?

29:33.575 --> 29:35.208
I just assured Annika that my strength

29:35.210 --> 29:37.410
was in my ability to hire multiple doctors

29:37.412 --> 29:41.047
and that I would obviously hire
a new spa-specialized physician.

29:41.049 --> 29:43.950
Ah, yes. A "spashalized" physician.

29:43.952 --> 29:45.385
I must have missed that rotation.

29:45.387 --> 29:46.686
You can mock all you want,

29:46.688 --> 29:48.521
but not every Tom, Dick, or Henry

29:48.523 --> 29:50.190
with an M.D. tacked on to their name

29:50.192 --> 29:51.591
is gonna be sensitive to her needs.

29:51.593 --> 29:53.860
Oh, my God. This is insanity.

29:53.862 --> 29:55.962
- This is the best game of pool...
- Hello, this is Hank.

29:55.964 --> 29:57.263
I've ever played. Paige, get the flip cam.

29:57.265 --> 29:58.731
Okay, I'll be right there.

29:58.733 --> 30:01.301
Looks like I'm needed
at Keller's. Gotta go. Sorry.

30:01.303 --> 30:02.669
You can't bail right now, dude.

30:02.671 --> 30:04.637
- I'm running the table!
- It's a doctor thing.

30:04.639 --> 30:06.639
- Henry, you're not leaving now!
- Toodles.

30:06.641 --> 30:09.309
Come back here
and lose like a man! Henry...

30:09.311 --> 30:10.477
Paige, where's the flip?

30:10.479 --> 30:12.612
Where's the... I'll get it myself.

30:15.783 --> 30:17.217
Divya.

30:17.219 --> 30:19.319
Divya, no. You can't give up.

30:19.321 --> 30:22.055
Don't worry... I have
no intention of giving up.

30:22.057 --> 30:26.826
I just need to figure out my next move.

30:33.734 --> 30:35.969
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:35.971 --> 30:37.504
What are you doing here?

30:37.506 --> 30:39.138
I thought you might like some backup.

30:39.140 --> 30:40.406
Absolutely.

30:41.610 --> 30:43.409
These antibiotics aren't working.

30:43.411 --> 30:44.744
I'll be the judge of that.

30:48.250 --> 30:50.016
These antibiotics aren't working.

30:50.018 --> 30:52.352
He looks pyrexic.
I'm gonna take his temperature

30:52.354 --> 30:53.987
and check his oxygen saturation.

30:53.989 --> 30:55.955
- What is wrong with me?
- I'm not sure.

30:55.957 --> 30:57.724
All your tests came back negative,

30:57.726 --> 30:59.993
but you have bilateral lower lobe rales.

30:59.995 --> 31:02.128
- In English, Hank.
- Your lungs don't sound good.

31:02.130 --> 31:04.597
His temperature's 103. O2 sat is only 89%.

31:04.599 --> 31:07.267
Heart rate is 60.
This looks like pneumonia.

31:07.269 --> 31:09.168
Again, not responding to an antibiotic.

31:09.170 --> 31:11.170
This is the second case I've seen today.

31:11.172 --> 31:12.472
Two cases that aren't responding.

31:12.474 --> 31:14.240
I saw a delivery guy
with similar symptoms,

31:14.242 --> 31:16.809
took him to the hospital.

31:16.811 --> 31:18.111
Are you coughing up blood?

31:18.113 --> 31:19.345
- I am now.
- Get dressed.

31:19.347 --> 31:21.781
We're taking you to the hospital
for some tests.

31:21.783 --> 31:25.118
Okay.

31:26.787 --> 31:29.155
Two similar pneumonias.

31:29.157 --> 31:31.491
High fevers.
Not responding to beta lactams?

31:31.493 --> 31:33.226
You're thinking legionnaires'.

31:33.228 --> 31:35.562
I am, and I'm not taking any chances.

31:35.564 --> 31:37.830
Things can go bad very quickly
if this is an outbreak.

31:37.832 --> 31:40.066
Two cases does not mean
that there's been an outbreak.

31:40.068 --> 31:42.235
Two cases so far.

31:44.345 --> 31:45.878
They both have legionnaires'.

31:45.880 --> 31:47.080
They have to have been
exposed to the bacteria

31:47.082 --> 31:48.481
- in the same place.
- I know.

31:48.483 --> 31:50.483
That's why we have to find the
source the old-fashioned way,

31:50.485 --> 31:52.518
by manually cross-matching
everywhere they've been

31:52.520 --> 31:55.154
in the past ten days.

31:55.156 --> 31:57.256
This is Keller's list.

31:57.258 --> 31:59.826
And this is Jake's.

31:59.828 --> 32:02.395
Let me guess. His delivery route.

32:02.397 --> 32:04.697
Exactly.

32:04.699 --> 32:07.266
Okay. Let's start with Keller.

32:23.183 --> 32:24.884
Nothing.

32:26.420 --> 32:28.588
Thank you.

32:32.626 --> 32:34.460
It's so weird going past Jill's office

32:34.462 --> 32:36.529
and seeing someone else's stuff in there.

32:36.531 --> 32:38.531
Yeah. I think it's gonna take a while

32:38.533 --> 32:41.668
to get used to all the changes
that have been happening lately.

32:41.670 --> 32:44.737
Speaking of which...

32:44.739 --> 32:45.972
have you given any further thought

32:45.974 --> 32:48.508
to subcontracting Evan?

32:48.510 --> 32:50.643
Didn't you hear? He got the posh account.

32:50.645 --> 32:52.612
- What? When?
- Apparently,

32:52.614 --> 32:55.548
Annika called this morning
and gave him the good news.

32:55.550 --> 32:57.684
- I don't understand.
- Dr. Sacani!

32:57.686 --> 33:00.186
Dr. Sacani, what are you doing here?

33:00.188 --> 33:02.522
Um, when I was with
Frenchie this morning...

33:02.524 --> 33:03.990
Frenchie?

33:03.992 --> 33:05.558
Oh, that's what Francesca's
friends call her.

33:05.560 --> 33:08.661
- We were in her kitchen.
- You were in her house.

33:08.663 --> 33:09.929
It was on Evan's list.

33:09.931 --> 33:11.364
"Follow up at patient's home as needed. "

33:11.366 --> 33:12.999
Okay. What's wrong with her?

33:13.001 --> 33:14.400
She's hyponatremic,

33:14.402 --> 33:15.568
and she's not responding
to my antibiotics.

33:15.570 --> 33:17.370
I know that it's less than 6%

33:17.372 --> 33:19.038
of all community-acquired pneumonia,

33:19.040 --> 33:20.606
but legionella can give you

33:20.608 --> 33:23.543
an isovolemic hypoosmolar
hyponatremia by suppressing

33:23.545 --> 33:25.745
the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

33:25.747 --> 33:27.113
Now, without that aldosterone,

33:27.115 --> 33:28.781
you just keep losing sodium in the urine,

33:28.783 --> 33:31.350
and you may end up with
type 4 renal tubular acidosis,

33:31.352 --> 33:34.120
you know, with the hyperkalemia
and the hyperchloremia

33:34.122 --> 33:37.323
and just... that's why I want her
tested for legionnaires'.

33:38.992 --> 33:41.027
Unfortunately, you're on the right track.

33:41.029 --> 33:43.262
We've got two confirmed cases
already here.

33:43.264 --> 33:44.997
I'm gonna go put a rush order
on that test.

33:44.999 --> 33:47.166
- Okay, good.
- By any chance

33:47.168 --> 33:49.368
is Posh Day Spa on Jake's delivery route?

33:49.370 --> 33:51.504
- Why?
- We treated Ms. Bragalini

33:51.506 --> 33:52.772
at Posh two days ago.

33:52.774 --> 33:55.842
Uh, let's see.

33:55.844 --> 33:58.745
Yeah. Yeah, Jake's made
deliveries there twice

33:58.747 --> 34:00.713
in the past two weeks.

34:00.715 --> 34:02.849
Uh, where's Keller's list?

34:12.860 --> 34:15.594
Keller.

34:15.597 --> 34:17.163
Where do you get waxed?

34:17.165 --> 34:19.532
Everywhere, head to toe.
Shoulders to boulders.

34:19.534 --> 34:21.701
No. Where do you go to get waxed?

34:21.703 --> 34:23.268
Oh.

34:26.672 --> 34:28.808
Okay, and... stop. You're gonna love this.

34:28.810 --> 34:30.208
This is, like, the best
surprise ever, okay?

34:30.210 --> 34:31.344
- Yeah?
- You ready?

34:31.346 --> 34:33.545
Mm-hmm.

34:35.748 --> 34:37.283
I got the account.

34:37.284 --> 34:39.284
Aw.

34:39.286 --> 34:40.585
I knew you would.

34:40.588 --> 34:41.821
This is just the beginning too.

34:41.822 --> 34:42.889
The beginning of what?

34:42.891 --> 34:44.623
One sec. Hold on.

34:44.626 --> 34:46.058
It's the same guy. I'm sorry.

34:46.060 --> 34:48.261
I can't believe this is happening.

34:49.898 --> 34:53.266
Annika. Hey.

34:53.268 --> 34:55.268
What's going on?

34:55.270 --> 34:57.203
County health is testing
for legionnaires' disease.

34:57.205 --> 34:58.437
They're closing my spa indefinitely.

34:58.439 --> 35:00.306
No, no, no... they can't close our spa.

35:00.308 --> 35:02.842
'Scuse me. 'Scuse me, hi, guys.

35:02.844 --> 35:05.111
Uh, you're actually...
you're not allowed to do this.

35:05.113 --> 35:06.779
Whole area's a health risk, sir.

35:06.781 --> 35:08.347
Really? So this sign right here,

35:08.349 --> 35:09.582
I'm noticing...

35:09.584 --> 35:10.950
You can't do it!

35:10.952 --> 35:12.451
I'm surprised Dr. Lawson didn't tell you.

35:12.453 --> 35:14.654
I'm sorry. What did you say?

35:14.656 --> 35:16.789
Well, he's the one who made the diagnosis.

35:16.791 --> 35:19.025
He said he'd rushed one
of my clients to the hospital

35:19.027 --> 35:20.693
right after he pulled himself
out of the running.

35:20.695 --> 35:22.695
He pulled himself out of the
running? When did he do that?

35:22.697 --> 35:24.130
This morning. He left me a message.

35:24.132 --> 35:26.699
And this afternoon, Posh is closed.

35:26.701 --> 35:28.000
He must not have wanted his name

35:28.002 --> 35:29.635
associated with a contaminated spa.

35:29.637 --> 35:31.904
Not his name, no.

35:39.246 --> 35:41.147
Hey. What's the story?

35:41.149 --> 35:43.316
You're all gonna be fine.
You'll only be here long enough

35:43.318 --> 35:44.750
for the antibiotics to get a head start

35:44.752 --> 35:46.085
wiping out the disease.

35:46.087 --> 35:47.720
Did they figure out how we all got it?

35:47.722 --> 35:49.889
It has to be the water wall at Posh

35:49.891 --> 35:51.057
because Jake only made deliveries

35:51.059 --> 35:52.592
at the reception desk.

35:52.594 --> 35:54.493
So if it's contaminated,
you could have gotten sick

35:54.495 --> 35:56.529
by just walking past
and breathing the mist.

35:56.531 --> 35:59.532
The reason why the three of you got sick

35:59.534 --> 36:01.601
is because the three of you
are immunocompromised.

36:01.603 --> 36:03.469
That's information my lawyer's
gonna want to have.

36:03.471 --> 36:05.438
All right, before you file a lawsuit

36:05.440 --> 36:09.141
or decide to just be happy
that you'll be okay,

36:09.143 --> 36:10.910
can I talk to you about something else?

36:10.912 --> 36:13.246
You've changed your mind about my offer.

36:21.255 --> 36:22.622
You're right.

36:22.624 --> 36:24.690
They found legionella in the water wall.

36:24.692 --> 36:26.759
It was drained and cleaned
by county health,

36:26.761 --> 36:29.161
and Posh Spa will reopen
by the end of the month.

36:29.163 --> 36:31.831
Well, I'm sure Evan will be
very happy to hear that.

36:31.833 --> 36:34.133
I must say, for someone so competitive,

36:34.135 --> 36:35.801
you don't seem to be very bothered

36:35.803 --> 36:37.703
that Evan got the account.

36:37.705 --> 36:39.538
What do you expect me to do?

36:39.540 --> 36:40.773
I expect you to be bothered.

36:40.775 --> 36:42.942
Well, I'm not. I'm happy for him.

36:42.944 --> 36:45.211
You pulled out of
the competition, didn't you?

36:45.213 --> 36:47.346
No! I mean...

36:47.348 --> 36:49.215
Yeah, I did.

36:49.217 --> 36:51.150
Look, and I realized the only
reason I wanted this job

36:51.152 --> 36:52.752
was so I could beat Evan.

36:52.754 --> 36:55.087
I don't know what came over me.
That's just not me.

36:55.089 --> 36:57.990
Anyway, it's the perfect account for Evan,

36:57.992 --> 36:59.959
so if there's anything I can do
to help him keep it,

36:59.961 --> 37:01.060
I will.

37:01.062 --> 37:02.695
Thanks a lot, Henry.

37:02.697 --> 37:04.697
Thanks for setting me up for failure.

37:04.699 --> 37:07.099
- Thanks!
- What are you talking about?

37:07.101 --> 37:08.367
You pulled out of the spa.

37:08.369 --> 37:10.770
The moment you realized
it was riddled with disease,

37:10.772 --> 37:12.405
you pulled out. You screwed me.

37:12.407 --> 37:13.773
You're kidding, right?

37:13.775 --> 37:15.241
Yeah, I'm kidding!

37:15.243 --> 37:17.176
Ha ha ha!

37:17.178 --> 37:19.312
I'm sorry, you think I did that to you,

37:19.314 --> 37:22.648
let alone run from a building
full of potentially sick people?

37:22.650 --> 37:24.951
Then why did you pull out?

37:26.487 --> 37:28.254
Because I...

37:28.256 --> 37:31.324
- because...
- Because you thought I'd lose.

37:31.326 --> 37:33.626
I didn't want it.
And I was trying to help.

37:33.628 --> 37:34.627
- Did I ask for your help?
- No.

37:34.629 --> 37:36.095
That's right, I didn't.

37:36.097 --> 37:37.163
Yeah, but you're
my little brother, so if...

37:37.165 --> 37:38.731
Oh, so now I'm a charity case?

37:38.733 --> 37:39.732
- Or was that pity?
- Evan...

37:39.734 --> 37:41.000
Look, I don't need your help.

37:41.002 --> 37:42.535
I don't want your help.

37:42.537 --> 37:44.303
What I do want is for you
to stop treating me

37:44.305 --> 37:45.638
like some screw-up little kid.

37:45.640 --> 37:47.073
But you'll never do that,

37:47.075 --> 37:49.942
because you like feeling
better than me... you always have.

37:49.944 --> 37:52.278
Or maybe you're just mad and resentful

37:52.280 --> 37:55.781
because somehow, some way,
you always do mess things up,

37:55.783 --> 37:58.184
and I'm left to clean up the mess.

37:58.186 --> 37:59.885
And I am tired of always
cleaning up after you.

37:59.887 --> 38:03.556
- Then don't!
- I won't!

38:07.607 --> 38:09.441
Yeah. And Hankmed's even gonna throw in

38:09.443 --> 38:12.010
free medical exams
to all the spa's clients

38:12.012 --> 38:13.612
just to make sure they're okay.

38:13.614 --> 38:15.747
Even though I really want them
all to sign retainer agreements.

38:15.749 --> 38:17.216
Great, so if you want to follow up

38:17.218 --> 38:18.584
or you need a doctor or anything,

38:18.586 --> 38:20.452
don't hesitate to call.

38:20.454 --> 38:21.954
Wonderful. Okay, bye.

38:21.956 --> 38:25.290
I'm turning legionnaires'
into legion-aide, baby!

38:25.292 --> 38:27.359
Your fiancee is a genius.
Kiss him, kiss him.

38:27.361 --> 38:30.562
Tell him to go away.

38:30.564 --> 38:33.765
By the way, would it be okay
if I crashed here for a while?

38:33.767 --> 38:36.235
- Why?
- Just 'cause the environment

38:36.237 --> 38:38.871
at the guest house
is a little toxic at the moment.

38:38.873 --> 38:40.839
You know my parents would
never let you stay here

38:40.841 --> 38:42.241
before we're married.

38:42.243 --> 38:43.575
Well, technically,
we wouldn't both be here

38:43.577 --> 38:44.776
'cause you'll be in England, right?

38:44.778 --> 38:47.379
No, I won't. I got fired.

38:47.381 --> 38:48.714
What?

38:48.716 --> 38:50.716
When?

38:52.418 --> 38:53.886
Why didn't you tell me?

38:53.888 --> 38:55.854
Because you've been preoccupied

38:55.856 --> 38:57.389
ever since I stepped through the door.

38:57.391 --> 38:59.258
No, I... I...

38:59.260 --> 39:02.794
You just got back on a really
busy weekend, that's all.

39:02.796 --> 39:05.330
I've been home for four days.

39:08.635 --> 39:12.170
Oh, my God.

39:17.277 --> 39:19.945
I'm sorry.

39:25.718 --> 39:28.654
Now you have my undivided attention.

39:28.656 --> 39:31.423
Tell me what happened.

39:43.870 --> 39:45.437
- Oh, hey, Hank.
- Hey, Jake.

39:45.439 --> 39:46.939
Thanks for driving out
of your way to see me, man.

39:46.941 --> 39:49.608
I really appreciate that.
And thanks for calling my boss.

39:49.610 --> 39:50.943
You saved my job.

39:50.945 --> 39:52.277
Yeah, no problem. Is everything okay?

39:52.279 --> 39:55.247
Everything's great.
And I have something for you.

39:55.249 --> 39:56.815
Jake, you didn't need to get me anything.

39:56.817 --> 39:58.617
I didn't... Jill asked me
to deliver this to you

39:58.619 --> 40:00.485
before she left for Africa,

40:00.487 --> 40:02.054
but got sick and forgot.

40:02.056 --> 40:03.555
So I hope it's not time-sensitive.

40:03.557 --> 40:04.756
Oh. Thanks, man.

40:10.730 --> 40:14.299
"Hank, if you stop by my house
to take me to the airport,"

40:14.301 --> 40:16.301
"I'm sorry I wasn't there. "

40:16.303 --> 40:20.005
"But like I said, I hate good-byes. "

40:20.007 --> 40:22.674
"I'm officially gone, but I have no doubt"

40:22.676 --> 40:24.576
"the clinic patients are in good hands"

40:24.578 --> 40:27.112
"and always will be... with you. "

40:27.114 --> 40:29.414
"Thank you for that. "

40:29.416 --> 40:33.652
"And thank you for your
friendship these past summers. "

40:33.654 --> 40:35.988
"It really feels like
we've known each other forever,"

40:35.990 --> 40:39.124
"so thank you for that feeling too. "

40:39.126 --> 40:41.693
"And thank you for always
being honest with me,"

40:41.695 --> 40:43.929
"even when it was hard. "

40:43.931 --> 40:45.764
"But mostly, thank you for making me"

40:45.766 --> 40:47.532
"a part of your Hankmed family. "

40:47.534 --> 40:50.369
"It's what I'll miss the most. "

40:50.371 --> 40:54.539
"Wait for me... "

40:54.541 --> 40:57.643
"to get settled, and I'll send
you my new contact info. "

40:59.846 --> 41:03.415
"Until then, take care, Hank. "

41:03.417 --> 41:06.051
"P.S., I really wish you guys could see"

41:06.053 --> 41:08.787
"how amazing this place is. "

41:08.789 --> 41:11.089
"Please know you've got an open invitation"

41:11.091 --> 41:12.891
"to come visit. "
