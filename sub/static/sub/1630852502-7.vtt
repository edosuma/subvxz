WEBVTT

00:00.289 --> 00:02.844
There's a full-time position in
Emergency Pediatrics opening up.

00:02.869 --> 00:04.902
I'd have to discuss that with my wife.

00:04.927 --> 00:06.398
Could be an exciting new chapter.

00:06.423 --> 00:08.881
So we can only be together
when no one's around?

00:08.906 --> 00:10.247
It's nobody's business.

00:10.272 --> 00:12.096
Are those our things?

00:12.567 --> 00:14.388
What happened?

00:15.076 --> 00:17.953
Pavel, I don't understand.

00:17.978 --> 00:19.341
I caught up with rent last month.

00:19.366 --> 00:20.958
Just to bounce this month's cheque.

00:20.983 --> 00:23.787
Only because... I took a payday loan.

00:24.186 --> 00:26.912
And they took more interest from
your account than you expected?

00:27.222 --> 00:29.452
Those people are the real criminals.

00:29.477 --> 00:30.810
And the owners?

00:30.835 --> 00:33.367
They will take any excuse to
rent to someone who'll pay more.

00:34.676 --> 00:36.670
I'm sorry, Bashir. It's out of my hands.

00:36.695 --> 00:41.001
No, no, what if I offered
them some cash to compensate?

00:42.155 --> 00:44.584
I can ask, but no promises.

00:44.609 --> 00:46.092
Thank you.

00:47.298 --> 00:49.258
You have a place to sleep tonight?

00:55.111 --> 00:57.732
This is all a big misunderstanding.

00:59.107 --> 01:01.256
We're fine, sweetie. I
don't want you to worry.

01:01.281 --> 01:04.327
Mr. and Mrs. Rahal says
we can stay with them.

01:04.894 --> 01:08.695
Why don't you go upstairs with Daneesha,
and I'll put our things away.

01:08.744 --> 01:10.944
Pavel is letting us use the
store room for tonight.

01:11.190 --> 01:14.534
You bought this for me.
It's where I read.

01:15.715 --> 01:17.453
We're not losing it.

01:18.757 --> 01:21.207
I'll fix this. Mm?

01:21.504 --> 01:23.076
Okay, now go.

01:40.935 --> 01:45.685

02:09.083 --> 02:11.199
You're supposed to be asleep!

02:11.224 --> 02:12.730
You're the one working today.

02:12.755 --> 02:14.566
I should be making breakfast for you.

02:14.591 --> 02:18.139
No, no. When my wife visits
me with a trip to Toronto,

02:18.164 --> 02:19.497
I get to spoil her.

02:19.522 --> 02:21.142
Those are the rules, baby.

02:21.550 --> 02:24.238
Two nights, no kids,

02:24.263 --> 02:27.523
no bedtimes, no tantrums.

02:27.612 --> 02:30.484
Just me time for Mel.

02:30.772 --> 02:32.267
Mel time.

02:38.463 --> 02:40.217
Put the tray away.

02:53.907 --> 02:55.551
Hey, Bash.

03:08.611 --> 03:10.010
- Dr. Hamed.
- Hey.

03:10.035 --> 03:12.112
- This is my son, Henry.
- Hello, Henry.

03:12.137 --> 03:14.240
You here to guard the
place with your dad?

03:14.265 --> 03:16.036
Yeah, just until his grandma comes.

03:16.061 --> 03:18.231
His mom and I had our schedules
mixed up this morning.

03:18.256 --> 03:20.329
Dr. Hamed? Curtain one.

03:20.354 --> 03:22.001
Nice to meet you Henry.

03:22.195 --> 03:23.392
Freeze!

03:23.417 --> 03:24.925
Our job is to protect them,

03:24.950 --> 03:26.487
not tell them where to go, little man.

03:26.512 --> 03:27.649
Apologize to the doctor.

03:27.674 --> 03:29.440
It's cool. I feel safer already.

03:30.709 --> 03:32.576
Come on, I'll show you around.

03:39.157 --> 03:40.813
Hi. I'm Dr. Hamed.

03:40.838 --> 03:44.058
I understand you're having some
trouble breathing, Mr. Watson?

03:44.305 --> 03:46.775
- You're my doctor?
- Mm-hmm.

03:46.800 --> 03:48.733
How long has this been going on?

03:48.856 --> 03:50.149
Couple of days.

03:50.282 --> 03:51.329
Started with a cough.

03:51.354 --> 03:53.252
My GP told me I should come in here.

03:54.274 --> 03:56.570
Alright, deep breath.

03:56.826 --> 03:59.071
Where you from, Dr. Hamed?

03:59.375 --> 04:00.737
Syria.

04:01.273 --> 04:04.620
Any history of asthma or
recurrent chest infection?

04:05.138 --> 04:06.914
Just a cough, like I said.

04:09.999 --> 04:11.720
I think I should see someone else.

04:12.570 --> 04:16.160
We have many specialists, but we
only call them when required.

04:16.185 --> 04:17.868
No, you don't understand.

04:18.386 --> 04:20.382
I want another doctor.

04:37.551 --> 04:38.905
Theo.

04:42.168 --> 04:45.796
What do I do if a patient refuses
to see me because of my race?

04:46.093 --> 04:47.621
Did that happen?

04:49.143 --> 04:53.293
Memorial has a strict policy
against racial discrimination.

04:53.318 --> 04:55.609
So you can report it to
your supervising doctor,

04:55.634 --> 04:57.131
and they'll decide how to handle it.

04:57.156 --> 04:58.823
I'm not filing a formal complaint.

04:59.116 --> 05:00.601
Trauma in two minutes.

05:00.626 --> 05:02.470
Dr. Hamed, we need you.

05:03.140 --> 05:05.774
Can you just see the guy?
He needs a chest X-ray.

05:05.799 --> 05:06.921
Yeah, of course.

05:06.946 --> 05:08.008
Bohai Shao.

05:08.033 --> 05:09.814
Witnesses at Pearson
said he started seizing,

05:09.839 --> 05:12.413
- and fell down a flight of stairs.
- You picked him up at the airport?

05:12.438 --> 05:15.414
Yes, and there was nobody with him.

05:15.439 --> 05:17.758
- Where else does it hurt, sir?
- He doesn't speak English.

05:17.783 --> 05:19.162
ID says Chinese national.

05:19.187 --> 05:20.749
He was on a flight from Beijing.

05:25.266 --> 05:27.698
Board out on three. One, two, three.

05:27.723 --> 05:30.357
One, two, three.

05:30.382 --> 05:31.581
Airway's patent.

05:31.606 --> 05:33.727
Potential distal fracture
to the right tibia.

05:35.974 --> 05:37.485
Equal breath sounds bilaterally.

05:37.510 --> 05:39.500
BP's normal.

05:39.525 --> 05:42.188
- 50 micro grams fentanyl.
- Got it.

05:47.605 --> 05:49.499
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

05:52.947 --> 05:54.412
We're here to take care of you.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.236
Everything's going to be fine, sir.

05:56.261 --> 05:58.361
We're just giving you
something for the pain.

05:58.386 --> 06:00.152
It's going to be okay.

06:09.602 --> 06:11.146
It's not Cantonese.

06:11.171 --> 06:14.329
I don't speak Mandarin, but it doesn't
sound like that to me either.

06:14.354 --> 06:16.653
Could be a regional dialect,
they can be very different.

06:16.678 --> 06:18.505
Okay. Call for a translator.

06:18.573 --> 06:20.227
Okay, go ahead.

06:25.242 --> 06:26.648
What is that?

06:26.673 --> 06:28.320
It's a name.

06:28.361 --> 06:31.758
- A family member, maybe?
- Daughter.

06:31.783 --> 06:33.346
Daughter.

06:33.400 --> 06:35.219
- Daughter.
- This is your daughter?

06:35.244 --> 06:36.329
Daughter.

06:36.354 --> 06:38.195
We have to call this number.

06:38.220 --> 06:39.336
Daughter. Daughter.

06:39.361 --> 06:42.438
We'll do our best to find her.
Okay, get him to an X-ray.

06:42.463 --> 06:44.489
No, wait, wait, look! Petechiae.

06:44.714 --> 06:46.008
Look.

06:46.258 --> 06:47.789
He was on an overseas flight?

06:47.814 --> 06:49.117
That's what the paramedics said.

06:49.142 --> 06:50.641
Okay. Put him in
isolation pending bloods

06:50.666 --> 06:52.227
and make sure he doesn't
have anything infectious.

06:52.252 --> 06:53.352
Got it.

06:55.469 --> 06:57.391
It's going to be okay, sir.

06:58.185 --> 07:00.212
Everything's going to be okay.

07:09.386 --> 07:11.682
- Yes?
- Nothing. Well...

07:12.632 --> 07:15.969
Usually that rash is the kind of
thing you'd be the first to notice.

07:15.994 --> 07:17.992
I. Are you okay?

07:19.850 --> 07:21.317
I'm fine.

07:21.817 --> 07:24.988
So, the triage nurse says you've
been vomiting all morning, Selena?

07:25.013 --> 07:27.539
I wouldn't say all morning. Um...

07:27.564 --> 07:29.054
Two or three times.

07:29.079 --> 07:32.594
I was out dancing with friends.
It's probably just a hangover.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.539
Well, most people go to a
Greasy Spoon for that,

07:34.564 --> 07:35.782
not the emergency department.

07:35.807 --> 07:37.617
Except I'm not most people.

07:37.642 --> 07:39.075
Yeah, you have CIPA.

07:39.100 --> 07:42.547
It's a rare genetic disorder. I
don't feel heat or cold or...

07:42.572 --> 07:43.804
Pain.

07:44.625 --> 07:46.426
You know about CIPA?

07:47.549 --> 07:49.637
Most doctors are clueless about it.

07:49.768 --> 07:51.320
Guess I'm not most doctors.

07:51.374 --> 07:55.406
From my understanding, you do
still feel touch, pressure...

07:55.525 --> 07:58.266
Yeah. And I can taste my food.

07:58.339 --> 08:00.105
Most people are curious about that.

08:00.119 --> 08:03.110
But since you don't sweat, you can't
regulate your body temperature,

08:03.135 --> 08:06.438
which means it's hard to tell
when a fever means an infection.

08:06.604 --> 08:09.196
- I'm guessing is why you're here?
- Mm-hmm.

08:09.314 --> 08:11.992
Yeah. I would much rather
be at a Greasy Spoon.

08:13.356 --> 08:16.570
Well, I'll get you started on an IV.
Rehydrate you.

08:16.595 --> 08:18.203
Run some blood work,

08:18.228 --> 08:20.350
basic precautionary stuff.

08:22.119 --> 08:24.630
Oh, no thanks. Ever since
I moved out last month,

08:24.655 --> 08:27.955
my mom calls me every night and
every morning for proof of life,

08:27.980 --> 08:31.242
and if I don't answer, she calls
every 15 minutes until I do. So...

08:31.267 --> 08:34.383
Sorry. Can you just
open your mouth for me?

08:38.037 --> 08:39.405
Bit my cheek?

08:39.431 --> 08:40.820
Yeah.

08:40.873 --> 08:42.941
Yeah. I always taste it eventually.

08:54.418 --> 08:57.695
As soon as we get your labs back,
we'll know if we can let you go.

08:57.720 --> 08:58.720
Daughter.

08:58.745 --> 09:01.000
We don't know if they've found her yet.

09:02.346 --> 09:03.885
Arnold was right.

09:03.910 --> 09:06.123
Our Chinese translator says Mr. Shao

09:06.148 --> 09:07.884
speaks a rare dialect called Wenzhou.

09:07.909 --> 09:09.648
They're trying to find
someone who knows it.

09:09.673 --> 09:11.391
Why aren't you masked?

09:11.644 --> 09:14.721
Blood work came back, and
it explains the rash.

09:15.141 --> 09:17.665
Platelets are low and
blasts are on the smear.

09:19.524 --> 09:22.411
- He has cancer.
- Acute myeloid leukemia.

09:22.653 --> 09:24.858
With AML, he's prone to infection.

09:24.883 --> 09:27.325
And that may be why he seized.

09:27.700 --> 09:30.317
He's gonna need a CT to
check for abscesses.

09:30.811 --> 09:33.323
He's got a terminal disease,
and we can't tell him.

09:34.484 --> 09:35.742
Daughter?

09:37.402 --> 09:38.867
You're nauseated again?

09:39.273 --> 09:41.309
How often do you still need this?

09:41.489 --> 09:44.989
It comes and goes, so very
normal post-concussion.

09:45.014 --> 09:47.922
Uh-huh. Says you, or your neurologist?

09:48.662 --> 09:51.633
We both know doctors
make the worst patients.

09:54.539 --> 09:56.264
Jonah's in town.

09:56.674 --> 09:58.515
I'm having lunch with him tomorrow.

09:59.652 --> 10:01.227
Well...

10:02.421 --> 10:06.222
I wouldn't want you to be
nauseous for lunch with your son.

10:07.864 --> 10:10.610
- I have something to tell you.
- Mm-hmm.

10:12.183 --> 10:13.906
I left Eric.

10:16.645 --> 10:18.377
You left your husband?

10:18.864 --> 10:21.208
- A few months ago.
- A few months ago?

10:21.233 --> 10:22.786
And you didn't say anything?

10:22.962 --> 10:24.959
Well, it wasn't about you.

10:25.664 --> 10:27.106
And...

10:27.901 --> 10:31.371
I need some time to figure
out my life on my own.

10:34.560 --> 10:36.721
So you want us to stop.

10:48.198 --> 10:50.859
I'm glad you're having lunch with Jonah.

10:55.859 --> 10:59.226
This time I was only $50 short
when the cheque didn't clear.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.954
I was told there wouldn't
be an overdraft fee.

11:03.221 --> 11:06.139
No, no, no, please don't
transfer, don't transfer!

11:19.378 --> 11:21.787
I just spoke to my
father a few days ago.

11:22.062 --> 11:24.390
I had no idea he was even out of town.

11:38.349 --> 11:39.957
Daughter.

11:40.680 --> 11:43.273
This man isn't my father.

11:46.821 --> 11:49.343
Don't be stingy with the
painkillers, sweetie.

11:50.711 --> 11:52.210
You're my doctor?

11:52.476 --> 11:55.623
You have something called a
tension pneumothorax, Mr. Watson.

11:55.648 --> 11:58.013
Air escapes the lung, filling
the space outside of it,

11:58.038 --> 12:01.038
which means it can't expand
when you try to take a breath.

12:01.202 --> 12:03.772
First, we're gonna use a needle,
try to release the trapped air.

12:03.797 --> 12:06.952
Then, put in a drain called a pigtail.

12:06.977 --> 12:09.354
Yeah, the pretty lady was
explaining it to me.

12:11.320 --> 12:13.343
- I can take this...
- No, no way!

12:13.411 --> 12:15.265
If you're gonna stick
a needle in my chest,

12:15.290 --> 12:17.038
I'm gonna need her to distract me.

12:17.063 --> 12:19.491
Aren't you a little bit too
old to be afraid of needles?

12:19.516 --> 12:21.428
Hey, Doc.

12:21.663 --> 12:23.006
How could this happen?

12:23.031 --> 12:25.328
I'm in construction. I work on my feet.

12:25.518 --> 12:27.811
I haven't smoked a day in my life.
What is this?

12:27.904 --> 12:29.640
There's a few possibilities.

12:29.665 --> 12:33.753
But the procedure is
fast and non-invasive.

12:34.509 --> 12:37.967
When I release the air
from around the lung,

12:38.656 --> 12:40.489
hopefully it will re-expand,

12:40.514 --> 12:43.116
and you should feel much...

12:43.736 --> 12:45.523
much better.

12:47.687 --> 12:50.718
You said hopefully. What if it doesn't?

12:50.743 --> 12:53.741
Well, if the needle aspiration
and pigtail doesn't work,

12:53.766 --> 12:55.614
then you'll need a chest tube.

12:55.639 --> 12:58.652
- You do that?
- No, that's a consult for thoracics.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.230
You look like you know
what you're doing.

13:02.290 --> 13:05.597
You never know what I'll get
if you send me somewhere else.

13:05.789 --> 13:07.574
You mean who you'll get.

13:08.617 --> 13:10.254
Can you tell him that the CT

13:10.279 --> 13:12.392
we ordered showed an
abscess on his brain?

13:12.417 --> 13:14.832
It's a complication of his
leukemia, brought on by infection.

13:14.857 --> 13:17.581
- It's why he seized.
- And we need to treat the abscess,

13:17.606 --> 13:19.049
otherwise it could be fatal.

13:21.761 --> 13:23.472
_

13:23.597 --> 13:27.527
_

13:28.504 --> 13:31.769
_

13:31.794 --> 13:33.128
_

13:37.644 --> 13:42.198
_

13:42.245 --> 13:46.285
_

13:55.941 --> 13:58.649
I think that he knows about the cancer,

13:58.674 --> 14:02.876
but he doesn't have enough Mandarin
for me to explain the abscess.

14:03.031 --> 14:05.246
Where are we with the
dialect specialist?

14:05.271 --> 14:08.129
I've made some calls, I'm still looking.
I may need the day.

14:08.652 --> 14:10.226
Daughter?

14:10.251 --> 14:11.644
Maybe he's...

14:12.351 --> 14:14.556
hoping she'll be a stem cell donor.

14:14.620 --> 14:17.324
His type of cancer can
sometimes be treated that way,

14:17.349 --> 14:18.432
as a last resort.

14:18.457 --> 14:21.800
Talk about a complicated way
to meet your real father.

14:21.860 --> 14:25.112
But understandable, if
you're facing death.

14:25.347 --> 14:26.994
She doesn't even know him.

14:27.019 --> 14:28.251
Well, maybe...

14:28.476 --> 14:30.662
Maybe he just wants to get to know her.

14:31.245 --> 14:32.531
How is he?

14:32.556 --> 14:35.386
Frustrated that we can't
understand him. Afraid.

14:35.739 --> 14:37.134
How are you?

14:37.347 --> 14:38.812
I'm not sure.

14:39.577 --> 14:41.019
I knew I was adopted,

14:41.277 --> 14:44.427
my mom and dad never knew
who my birth parents were.

14:45.278 --> 14:47.304
They're the only family I've ever known

14:47.696 --> 14:49.139
Did you ever want to know?

14:49.269 --> 14:52.069
When I was 16, they offered
to help me find answers.

14:52.224 --> 14:53.476
But I, um...

14:54.191 --> 14:56.042
I didn't want to have
to go through all that

14:56.067 --> 14:58.023
just to meet the people who gave me up.

14:58.850 --> 15:01.886
How would I find out if
he's really my father?

15:01.980 --> 15:04.222
If you decide that's
what you want to know,

15:04.247 --> 15:06.032
there is a simple blood test we can do.

15:07.138 --> 15:09.035
That's a lot to think about.

15:09.728 --> 15:11.369
Thank you.

15:13.843 --> 15:16.254
If you were in her place...

15:16.669 --> 15:18.311
would you want to know?

15:20.151 --> 15:23.214
You know me, I need answers.

15:24.053 --> 15:26.457
Your sister had to
tell me you were here.

15:26.482 --> 15:27.855
You couldn't have called?

15:27.880 --> 15:30.152
Nya. I told you not to say anything.

15:30.177 --> 15:32.043
She did the right thing. I need to know.

15:32.068 --> 15:33.683
Come on, Mom. I don't want to do this.

15:33.708 --> 15:36.456
What if you'd fallen, or
got alcohol poisoning?

15:36.908 --> 15:38.641
Is this your doctor?

15:38.666 --> 15:39.948
Dr. Curtis.

15:39.973 --> 15:41.832
Selena's gonna need full-body imaging,

15:41.857 --> 15:43.799
so we know why she's been vomiting.

15:43.824 --> 15:47.433
Ultrasound, CT, ECG,
MRI, and urinalysis.

15:47.458 --> 15:50.162
- I don't want any of it.
- You need it.

15:50.187 --> 15:52.089
I ordered a formal ultrasound,

15:52.114 --> 15:53.892
along with blood work,
that'll let us know

15:53.917 --> 15:55.175
if there's anything to
be concerned about.

15:55.200 --> 15:56.535
Okay, are you happy?

15:56.560 --> 15:59.627
I can take care of myself.
You need to back off, Mom.

15:59.919 --> 16:02.545
We were just dancing. That's all.

16:04.660 --> 16:06.424
I'll get you some water.

16:10.576 --> 16:12.533
I will block your number from my phone

16:12.558 --> 16:13.973
if you don't stop ratting me out.

16:13.998 --> 16:15.754
I'm sorry, Sel.

16:16.482 --> 16:18.433
I was worried too.

16:20.792 --> 16:22.926
I know I can be overbearing.

16:22.951 --> 16:26.152
We have protocols to follow,
even for rare disorders.

16:26.177 --> 16:27.191
See, that's the thing.

16:27.216 --> 16:29.957
Most CIPA kids are lucky
to make it to 25.

16:30.874 --> 16:33.327
Where you see a rare disorder,

16:33.352 --> 16:36.792
I see Selena at five, burning the
flesh off her hand on the stove,

16:36.817 --> 16:39.339
or walking on a broken ankle

16:39.364 --> 16:43.421
for a week without even knowing
until it wouldn't hold her anymore.

16:44.499 --> 16:46.666
I just want her safe and sound.

16:46.691 --> 16:48.258
I want the same thing, Mrs. Ruiz.

16:48.283 --> 16:50.847
I do. But Selena's 20. Okay?

16:50.875 --> 16:53.346
So her medical decisions
are in her hands.

16:55.070 --> 16:58.105
The patient has acute myeloid
lymphocytic leukemia

16:58.130 --> 17:00.419
which has led to a brain abscess
that needs to be managed.

17:00.444 --> 17:02.347
- Treatment?
- Aggressive antibiotics,

17:02.372 --> 17:04.144
until the infection has run its course.

17:04.169 --> 17:05.824
After which he should be stable.

17:06.557 --> 17:08.056
Dr. Leblanc?

17:08.170 --> 17:10.436
I think he needs a
surgical intervention.

17:10.473 --> 17:12.982
An endonasal is a more
comprehensive way to manage

17:13.007 --> 17:14.826
the abscess and avoid a rupture.

17:15.750 --> 17:18.684
Going in through the nose
to drain an abscess?

17:18.709 --> 17:20.825
That's a pretty delicate
surgical procedure.

17:20.849 --> 17:23.498
Yeah, but I think it offers him
a better long-term outcome.

17:23.522 --> 17:25.473
He's come here to get to
know his daughter better,

17:25.499 --> 17:27.395
a difficult surgery and a long recovery

17:27.420 --> 17:28.825
won't give him the chance to do that.

17:28.850 --> 17:30.349
Yeah, but without an
effective treatment,

17:30.374 --> 17:32.459
he'll die before she gets
any chance to know him.

17:32.484 --> 17:34.419
Well, this patient doesn't
have any insurance.

17:34.444 --> 17:36.577
We'll cover the emergent
costs if we need to,

17:36.602 --> 17:39.896
but... do you know if he
even can pay for surgery?

17:39.921 --> 17:42.135
Or indeed, if he wants it?

17:42.160 --> 17:44.282
Dr. Bishop, I really
think in this case I...

17:44.307 --> 17:46.641
I think you're trying to solve a problem

17:46.666 --> 17:49.528
that he might not want solved, Dr.
Leblanc.

17:50.306 --> 17:53.707
Run the antibiotics. If
that clears the abscess...

17:53.732 --> 17:55.043
Well, go.

18:09.495 --> 18:10.965
Was there something else?

18:10.990 --> 18:12.282
Actually, I, uh...

18:12.307 --> 18:14.954
I wanted to talk to you about a...

18:18.845 --> 18:21.379
About a possible advance on my salary.

18:21.620 --> 18:24.790
Well, that would go through
HR if we did them.

18:24.815 --> 18:26.118
But we don't.

18:26.295 --> 18:28.548
I understand sir, but my situation...

18:28.573 --> 18:30.290
I'm sorry, Dr. Hamed.

18:30.432 --> 18:32.445
I would tell any other
resident the same thing.

18:32.915 --> 18:34.364
Sorry.

18:36.053 --> 18:38.036
Close the door on your
way out, would you?

18:42.397 --> 18:44.263
Hey, Pavel. It's Bashir.

18:44.288 --> 18:47.388
Um. I wasn't able to come
up with the money yet.

18:47.413 --> 18:48.649
But...

18:48.837 --> 18:50.790
If the owners could
give me one more day...

18:50.815 --> 18:52.967
Hmm? Please?

18:53.127 --> 18:55.389
Uh, call me back.

19:05.363 --> 19:07.022
I need to know the truth.

19:07.286 --> 19:10.040
- You'll do this blood test?
- Of course.

19:11.243 --> 19:13.103
Is there anything you can do for him?

19:13.128 --> 19:14.999
Well, he has an acute condition,

19:15.024 --> 19:17.986
- which we're trying to manage.
- But his cancer...

19:18.096 --> 19:19.399
Is it treatable?

19:19.424 --> 19:22.287
We don't know what treatment
he's pursued so far.

19:23.632 --> 19:24.865
Is he dying?

19:25.121 --> 19:28.376
Unfortunately, his...
his cancer is advanced.

19:30.162 --> 19:32.338
To learn all of this now...

19:32.784 --> 19:34.550
There's no hope for him?

19:34.893 --> 19:38.928
There's still hope. He could
find a stem cell donor.

19:39.294 --> 19:40.806
A donor?

19:41.108 --> 19:42.640
You mean me?

19:44.006 --> 19:45.768
Is that why he's come here?

19:45.793 --> 19:48.196
- We don't know that.
- We don't, but...

19:54.499 --> 19:56.181
I need a minute.

19:59.194 --> 20:02.493
It's a viable option, and
they should both know it.

20:04.086 --> 20:05.785
You don't think I
should've said anything.

20:05.810 --> 20:09.012
First we need to know what
our patient actually wants.

20:18.624 --> 20:20.024
Your scan is clear.

20:20.049 --> 20:21.347
So I can go?

20:21.372 --> 20:24.587
Well, your white blood cell
count is high, which means...

20:24.618 --> 20:26.761
- Infection.
- Yeah.

20:26.794 --> 20:29.228
- Okay. What kind?
- I don't know yet.

20:29.253 --> 20:31.773
So I'd like to keep you overnight.

20:32.047 --> 20:35.652
What if I promise to come back
if I start throwing up again?

20:35.677 --> 20:38.172
You know, for another patient, I
might say yes. But for you...

20:38.197 --> 20:41.242
If you keep me here, she will freak.

20:41.368 --> 20:44.634
It's just gonna give her more
ammo to get me back home.

20:44.659 --> 20:47.271
OK, I get it. Your mother is...

20:48.258 --> 20:51.685
She's super intense, but my
concern is you and your fever.

20:51.710 --> 20:53.294
You don't get it.

20:53.505 --> 20:56.841
I've never dated.

20:58.502 --> 21:01.687
I didn't have a friend
that wasn't my sister

21:01.712 --> 21:04.375
until I was 17 years old.

21:04.400 --> 21:07.062
When I moved out, everything changed.

21:07.087 --> 21:10.088
I went on a hike last weekend.

21:10.211 --> 21:11.968
Can you imagine what she would say

21:11.993 --> 21:14.023
if she found out that I did that?

21:14.675 --> 21:17.527
Yeah, but...

21:19.641 --> 21:21.008
Please?

21:21.033 --> 21:23.409
Selena, I need you at baseline.

21:23.445 --> 21:26.286
Okay? That means
observation and cultures.

21:26.605 --> 21:28.914
If everything is fine in the
morning, you can go home.

21:29.241 --> 21:32.125
Just promise me you won't tell her
about my white blood cell count.

21:32.150 --> 21:35.628
I can't. Okay? Not without your consent.

21:36.369 --> 21:39.466
- Okay.
- Okay.

21:47.436 --> 21:49.837
- Hi.
<i>- Hi, Amira.</i>

21:49.862 --> 21:53.530
Mrs. Rahal says to tell you
that they'll save supper.

21:53.555 --> 21:55.722
Amira, I don't think I'm
going to come home tonight.

21:55.747 --> 21:57.218
<i>You're not?</i>

21:57.243 --> 21:59.653
No. I picked up an extra shift.

21:59.995 --> 22:02.448
And tomorrow? Are we going home?

22:03.011 --> 22:04.398
I don't think so.

22:04.423 --> 22:06.398
We're going to have to
figure something else out.

22:06.599 --> 22:10.121
Mrs. Rahal says we can stay
here as long as we need to.

22:10.248 --> 22:12.958
<i>There isn't enough room
for both of us there.</i>

22:12.983 --> 22:14.859
I'll rent a room somewhere else,

22:14.884 --> 22:16.335
and you can stay with Daneesha,

22:16.360 --> 22:17.702
<i>at least until we figure something else.</i>

22:17.727 --> 22:18.890
No.

22:18.915 --> 22:20.429
Habibti, I know this
isn't what we wanted,

22:20.454 --> 22:22.451
but this way you're close to school

22:22.476 --> 22:24.492
and you have help, and...

22:24.517 --> 22:28.341
_

22:28.366 --> 22:30.022
You're right. I'm...

22:30.047 --> 22:32.084
I'm sorry. But you have to understand...

22:32.109 --> 22:34.101
I don't care where we go, Bash.

22:34.126 --> 22:36.960
But please, we have to go together.

22:37.216 --> 22:39.359
Okay. Yella, bye.

22:39.384 --> 22:40.986
Bye.

22:49.739 --> 22:51.961
We said we would share!

22:51.986 --> 22:54.699
Yeah, we did, I ate exactly my half.

22:54.724 --> 22:56.933
Uh-uh. More like three-quarters.

22:56.958 --> 23:00.700
Oh, I think you need to
check your math first.

23:00.725 --> 23:02.799
- Mm-hmm?
- Mm-hmm.

23:05.404 --> 23:07.070
Thank you.

23:12.766 --> 23:15.145
- I miss us.
- Me too.

23:16.859 --> 23:18.398
I miss our life.

23:19.099 --> 23:21.609
A few more months, and
we'll have it all back.

23:23.414 --> 23:26.584
Bishop offered to recommend me

23:26.609 --> 23:28.919
for a full-time spot at the hospital

23:29.155 --> 23:30.732
Of course he did!

23:30.943 --> 23:33.371
I bet he was disappointed
when you said no.

23:36.117 --> 23:38.747
Theo, you didn't say yes, did you?

23:38.772 --> 23:40.981
No. No, But it's...

23:41.120 --> 23:43.087
It's an amazing opportunity.

23:43.155 --> 23:45.153
You already have an amazing opportunity.

23:45.178 --> 23:48.946
Yeah but, it's the kind
of cases you get here.

23:49.638 --> 23:53.808
It's just not like that in a
small-town family practice.

23:54.427 --> 23:57.363
My dad's waiting to retire
until you take over.

23:57.531 --> 24:00.774
We have a plan, a life we dreamed about.

24:01.753 --> 24:04.605
We made that plan when we were 20.

24:10.680 --> 24:12.661
Has something changed?

24:15.478 --> 24:17.832
Just, I don't know...

24:18.150 --> 24:21.502
I stayed close to home for med school,

24:21.705 --> 24:23.504
my residency...

24:24.214 --> 24:27.091
Just lately, felt like...

24:28.083 --> 24:30.262
maybe there's room for
us to expand a little?

24:30.759 --> 24:33.265
Are you unhappy?

24:33.746 --> 24:35.100
With us?

24:35.413 --> 24:36.768
No, Mel.

24:37.335 --> 24:39.093
Not at all.

24:39.118 --> 24:41.023
Because home is home.

24:41.207 --> 24:44.025
That'll never change. Not for me.
Not for the girls.

24:46.204 --> 24:47.976
I don't want it to.

24:51.717 --> 24:53.868
I know. Yeah.

24:57.423 --> 24:58.831
Me neither.

24:58.856 --> 25:00.074
Just...

25:00.794 --> 25:02.669
forget I mentioned it, okay?

25:04.681 --> 25:06.743
Nya was in with Selena this morning,

25:06.768 --> 25:09.574
and she told me another
doctor said something about

25:09.599 --> 25:12.179
Selena's CRP's being elevated?

25:12.335 --> 25:14.001
She won't let me see her.

25:14.026 --> 25:15.281
I'll have to check her chart.

25:15.306 --> 25:17.279
They were updating her
blood work overnight.

25:17.304 --> 25:21.383
Look, I know you can't tell me
anything unless she says it's okay,

25:21.408 --> 25:24.523
but that doesn't mean I can't
tell you things, right?

25:24.852 --> 25:28.555
When Selena was ten,
her CRP was elevated.

25:28.580 --> 25:31.155
Turns out she had appendicitis.

25:33.778 --> 25:35.478
I'm surprised they didn't operate.

25:35.503 --> 25:37.734
They felt surgery was too
risky given the fevers,

25:37.759 --> 25:40.456
so they treated her with antibiotics.

25:40.842 --> 25:42.703
There could be a number of reasons

25:42.728 --> 25:44.733
why your daughter's blood
proteins are elevated.

25:44.758 --> 25:47.000
I know, but she's in there talking about

25:47.025 --> 25:49.172
how you said she could go home.

25:49.197 --> 25:52.094
If she still has an infection,
she shouldn't be leaving.

25:52.364 --> 25:54.391
Just keep her here until you're sure.

25:54.416 --> 25:56.349
That's my baby girl.

25:56.560 --> 25:58.060
Look.

25:58.918 --> 26:00.727
I want to help, Mrs. Ruiz.

26:00.820 --> 26:04.772
You stay here, I'll go
find out what's going on.

26:05.333 --> 26:06.899
Thank you.

26:10.384 --> 26:12.405
You worked straight through yesterday?

26:12.597 --> 26:14.391
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

26:14.416 --> 26:15.988
No, no. Um...

26:16.013 --> 26:17.411
What did you say?

26:18.278 --> 26:19.744
You spent the night?

26:19.769 --> 26:21.086
Uh. Yeah.

26:21.111 --> 26:25.127
- I picked up the 10 to 6.
- Yeah.

26:26.505 --> 26:28.196
113 B.

26:29.580 --> 26:33.385
It's an overflow on-call room.
Everybody forgets it exists.

26:33.989 --> 26:35.554
Um, sorry?

26:35.705 --> 26:37.758
Uh, if you need somewhere quiet to sleep

26:37.783 --> 26:40.016
for a few hours when
you spend the night.

26:41.253 --> 26:43.227
- Thank you.
- Of course.

26:44.813 --> 26:46.313
Oh, and Harmony's back.

26:46.338 --> 26:48.672
Arnold says the paternity
test results are in.

26:48.697 --> 26:50.597
Yeah, I saw, I'll go talk to her.

26:50.622 --> 26:52.107
Excellent.

27:00.357 --> 27:01.856
Harmony?

27:02.200 --> 27:03.766
The results came back.

27:03.928 --> 27:06.376
Mr. Shao is your biological father.

27:11.829 --> 27:13.717
Is the reason he's here now

27:13.742 --> 27:15.552
that he wants something from me?

27:16.328 --> 27:18.865
What if he's just here
to make up for the time

27:18.890 --> 27:20.557
he lost when you were apart?

27:23.185 --> 27:25.130
We found the right translator.

27:25.155 --> 27:27.732
If you want, you can
hear what he has to say.

27:30.434 --> 27:32.033
Any vomiting last night?

27:32.214 --> 27:33.349
No.

27:33.470 --> 27:36.669
Why do I have a feeling you're
not gonna let me out of here?

27:37.449 --> 27:39.074
Have a seat.

27:39.486 --> 27:41.519
I told you that you could go home

27:41.544 --> 27:43.192
if all of your vitals were at baseline.

27:43.217 --> 27:45.021
But your white blood cell count is up,

27:45.046 --> 27:46.426
and so is your blood pressure.

27:46.451 --> 27:47.848
Oh.

27:49.366 --> 27:51.004
Have a look.

27:57.849 --> 27:59.979
Your appendix is extremely inflamed.

28:00.004 --> 28:03.384
We'll confirm with a CT, but I
think we're gonna have to operate

28:03.409 --> 28:04.526
What?

28:04.551 --> 28:06.644
You didn't see that on
the scan yesterday.

28:06.669 --> 28:08.018
Yesterday was non-diagnostic,

28:08.043 --> 28:10.415
but these things can escalate quickly.
Explains the vomiting.

28:10.440 --> 28:12.948
And when your mother told me about
your past bout with appendicitis...

28:12.973 --> 28:14.691
You spoke to my mom about this?

28:14.716 --> 28:17.769
Selena, what's important is
that we get you to the OR.

28:17.794 --> 28:19.346
If we don't remove your appendix now,

28:19.371 --> 28:21.425
sepsis from the infection
could kill you.

28:21.450 --> 28:23.550
But surgery could kill me.

28:23.575 --> 28:26.706
Selena, you don't have a choice.

28:28.909 --> 28:30.816
Dr. Hamed? I'm the translator.

28:30.841 --> 28:32.607
Mr. Shao says he started feeling worse.

28:32.632 --> 28:34.498
How much does he know about his cancer?

28:34.523 --> 28:36.175
He was diagnosed eight months ago.

28:36.200 --> 28:37.816
He's had two rounds of chemo,

28:37.841 --> 28:40.365
but didn't know about the
abscess when he left home.

28:40.390 --> 28:43.515
Okay. I'm just going to
check a couple of things.

28:56.586 --> 28:59.239
He said you took a blood test.

29:01.841 --> 29:03.492
It says you're my father

29:16.117 --> 29:18.590
There's so much you deserve to know

29:22.785 --> 29:24.890
Your fever is spiking.

29:25.514 --> 29:27.938
You need to breathe slowly, Mr.
Shao. Tell him!

29:29.487 --> 29:31.407
What's happening?

29:31.432 --> 29:33.673
His BP's elevated. Heart rate, 150.

29:33.698 --> 29:35.032
Give him a 1 litre bolus of NS.

29:35.057 --> 29:36.804
Can you ask him if he
has a sharp headache?

29:40.794 --> 29:42.561
Yes, he says very suddenly.

29:42.668 --> 29:44.758
He's seizing, I think
the abscess ruptured.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.660
Lorazepam, 2 mgs!

29:46.781 --> 29:48.210
What's happening?!

29:48.235 --> 29:49.866
You need to go back to the waiting room.

29:49.891 --> 29:52.000
He'll need a CT to confirm,
but if you're right...

29:52.025 --> 29:55.352
No. You were right. Call OR, we
need to get him into surgery now.

30:01.699 --> 30:03.310
How is your mother?

30:05.274 --> 30:06.872
Still with Simon.

30:07.569 --> 30:09.238
Is that the osteopath?

30:09.509 --> 30:11.850
- He's a teacher.
- Mm.

30:11.973 --> 30:14.396
And school? Have you
settled on a major yet?

30:14.615 --> 30:16.177
If you brought me here to tell me

30:16.202 --> 30:18.998
that indecision is the
enemy of progress again...

30:19.023 --> 30:20.657
I brought you here...

30:22.283 --> 30:24.983
I brought you here to
spend some time with you.

30:27.171 --> 30:29.871
I thought maybe you'd
have a bigger scar.

30:30.406 --> 30:33.874
Yeah. Well, I know I didn't exactly...

30:35.066 --> 30:37.711
share too much about what happened.

30:37.736 --> 30:39.380
You barely shared anything.

30:40.028 --> 30:42.674
Well, I didn't want to worry you.

30:44.152 --> 30:46.419
I don't want us to go this
long without talking again.

30:46.444 --> 30:48.431
But that was my fault.

30:49.379 --> 30:51.433
When your mother and I split up...

30:52.155 --> 30:53.810
I know I missed a lot.

30:54.987 --> 30:58.599
She was angry and I... I just
wanted to give her some space.

30:58.624 --> 31:00.485
Don't make this about Mom.

31:02.082 --> 31:05.334
You spent every waking hour
of our lives at the hospital.

31:06.185 --> 31:09.159
You didn't even come to my
high school graduation.

31:13.166 --> 31:16.501
There was a multi-car
pile-up on the 401.

31:17.841 --> 31:19.920
You save lives. I get it.

31:20.655 --> 31:22.235
I do.

31:22.713 --> 31:25.050
It's just the way you are, Dad.

31:28.047 --> 31:31.516
And if it's not the way I want to be?

31:33.460 --> 31:35.170
Is it too late?

31:37.477 --> 31:39.584
Can I at least talk to
the anesthesiologist?

31:39.609 --> 31:40.646
He needs to know...

31:40.671 --> 31:42.371
Hyperthermia is a risk,
even without infection.

31:42.396 --> 31:44.533
- So is aspiration.
- Mom...

31:44.558 --> 31:46.530
I'm just trying to make
sure they know what to do.

31:46.555 --> 31:47.701
We do, Mrs. Ruiz.

31:47.726 --> 31:50.639
We're taking all the precautions against
the risks associated with CIPA.

31:50.910 --> 31:52.287
I'm already scared.

31:52.312 --> 31:55.670
Hearing about all the extra ways that
you're scared too isn't helping.

31:55.994 --> 31:57.958
You're right, I'm sorry, baby.

31:58.382 --> 32:00.086
It's going to be okay.

32:11.002 --> 32:14.103
Even if this procedure goes
well, recovery will be hard.

32:14.648 --> 32:18.016
He can't leave to see his
daughter, he can't go home.

32:18.492 --> 32:20.440
He may never go back again.

32:22.339 --> 32:24.693
You've been working two
days straight, haven't you?

32:24.838 --> 32:26.852
If you want to go home, I got this.

32:27.278 --> 32:29.865
Actually I should be out finding one.

32:31.238 --> 32:33.036
What, a home?

32:34.614 --> 32:37.040
Are you okay? You and your sister?

32:40.088 --> 32:41.369
Right.

32:41.508 --> 32:43.880
Not a problem for me to solve, right?

32:45.892 --> 32:47.549
It's okay.

32:48.514 --> 32:50.094
He's still here.

32:50.119 --> 32:51.719
George Watson.

32:52.027 --> 32:54.097
He needs a chest tube,

32:54.122 --> 32:56.017
But he won't let anyone else do it.

32:56.042 --> 32:59.547
- Has he been giving you a hard time?
- He's been fine, mostly.

32:59.572 --> 33:01.204
But to him, I'm just a nurse.

33:01.229 --> 33:03.383
You know, a black woman
at his beck and call.

33:03.408 --> 33:05.664
Well, if it bothered you,
you covered it well.

33:05.689 --> 33:07.226
Oh it bothers me.

33:07.251 --> 33:10.477
But he is what he is.
And I'm a professional.

33:10.502 --> 33:12.368
Besides, he thinks he has all the power,

33:12.393 --> 33:14.475
but I'm the one controlling his IV drip.

33:16.096 --> 33:18.538
I grew up with guys like George.

33:18.707 --> 33:20.791
The world got bigger, why can't they?

33:21.989 --> 33:23.844
Somebody should say something.

33:23.869 --> 33:26.631
Oh you think you're gonna go
in there and cure his racism?

33:26.656 --> 33:28.840
You'd have better luck
with the chest tube.

33:32.291 --> 33:33.663
It's time, George.

33:33.688 --> 33:36.030
It's been over a day since I
aspirated and put in the pigtail.

33:36.055 --> 33:39.320
Your lung isn't cooperating.
You need a chest tube.

33:39.345 --> 33:40.835
Someone will be down to get you.

33:41.088 --> 33:43.689
If you're not the one who's
doing it, I don't want it.

33:44.157 --> 33:45.835
Well, it's not my field.

33:45.982 --> 33:47.948
What? You saying you don't know how?

33:48.103 --> 33:49.999
No. I'm saying there are other

33:50.024 --> 33:52.844
more qualified doctors who should do it.

33:52.994 --> 33:54.819
Fine. Forget it, then.

33:56.153 --> 33:58.125
You're willing to risk your own health

33:58.150 --> 34:00.029
instead of having
someone else treat you?

34:00.054 --> 34:02.600
I have a right to decide
who my doctor is.

34:02.625 --> 34:04.077
No, George.

34:04.110 --> 34:05.913
You have a right to treatment.

34:05.938 --> 34:07.404
And we're offering you that.

34:07.570 --> 34:09.295
Now, if you decide not to accept it...

34:09.321 --> 34:12.306
We'll discharge you, you can go
home and let your lungs fail.

34:12.331 --> 34:16.178
Otherwise, someone will be down
shortly to take you to thoracics.

34:16.203 --> 34:18.859
So go, don't go.

34:19.130 --> 34:20.632
It's your call.

34:32.973 --> 34:34.753
Selena did great.

34:36.277 --> 34:39.036
We removed her appendix, there
was no sign of perforation.

34:39.907 --> 34:41.554
She's in recovery.

34:48.882 --> 34:50.965
All I can think about is what...

34:51.545 --> 34:54.301
What would have happened
if she hadn't come in.

34:54.779 --> 34:56.071
But she did.

34:56.203 --> 34:57.906
I mean, she did everything
she should have.

34:57.931 --> 35:00.197
Everything you taught her to.

35:02.443 --> 35:03.895
I know.

35:06.396 --> 35:09.149
Why is it so hard for her to let me in?

35:10.291 --> 35:12.153
I know, I mean...

35:14.534 --> 35:16.031
Maybe...

35:16.778 --> 35:19.788
Maybe because you're so focused
on keeping Selena from dying

35:19.813 --> 35:22.830
when all she really wants
to do is live, you know?

35:28.526 --> 35:30.092
Hey, baby.

35:37.766 --> 35:40.014
Aren't you gonna ask me if it hurts?

35:43.528 --> 35:45.695
Dr. Curtis says you're doing great.

35:45.772 --> 35:47.980
We can probably set you free tomorrow.

35:49.852 --> 35:52.527
Let me guess, you want
me to come back home?

35:53.185 --> 35:54.489
Of course.

35:54.729 --> 35:57.073
But I know that's not what you want.

35:58.549 --> 36:00.242
Well maybe you...

36:00.577 --> 36:03.121
could come to my place for a bit?

36:03.739 --> 36:06.248
Just until I'm back on my feet?

36:19.420 --> 36:21.805
- How's he doing?
- He just woke up.

36:22.838 --> 36:24.456
He asked if you would come see him again

36:24.481 --> 36:27.060
and also wanted me to give you this.

36:53.260 --> 36:55.588
- Lou! Hey!
- Hey.

36:55.613 --> 36:57.455
Wait. Hi.

36:57.480 --> 36:59.384
- Hey.
- So...

36:59.638 --> 37:01.704
- I have a patient...
- Mm-hmm.

37:01.804 --> 37:04.071
Who can't feel pain.

37:04.421 --> 37:07.017
And she has to live her life

37:07.042 --> 37:08.935
afraid of what she can't feel.

37:08.960 --> 37:11.730
Mm. Well that can't be easy.

37:11.862 --> 37:14.649
Yeah. I wanna meet your son.

37:15.420 --> 37:20.071
Okay? So if that's something
you ever, ever want...

37:21.915 --> 37:23.948
Just let me know.

37:25.073 --> 37:26.364
Thank you.

37:26.575 --> 37:28.075
Yeah...

37:29.285 --> 37:31.832
- You want to go now, don't you?
- Yeah, I got some work to do.

37:31.857 --> 37:33.333
- Alright. I'll see you later.
- Okay.

37:33.358 --> 37:34.669
Tonight.

37:38.474 --> 37:40.593
I have two bedrooms.

37:41.543 --> 37:43.877
- Excuse me?
- I know, Mags told me,

37:43.902 --> 37:46.557
and you hate that, but just get over it.

37:46.582 --> 37:48.893
Amira can have one room,
you can be on the couch,

37:48.918 --> 37:50.904
until you sort things out, and, uh...

37:50.929 --> 37:53.029
At least that way you'll
both be under the same roof.

37:53.698 --> 37:56.583
- Honestly, Theo, I couldn't possibly—-
- Bash.

37:56.608 --> 37:59.620
I don't wanna fight you on this,
but I will if I have to so just...

37:59.645 --> 38:01.322
Let me help.

38:05.325 --> 38:09.828
It was still the one-child policy
when your mother became pregnant.

38:17.441 --> 38:20.013
She stayed inside as soon
as she started to show,

38:20.038 --> 38:21.215
afraid to be seen.

38:25.940 --> 38:30.075
Used a friend's urine to pass
mandatory non-pregnancy tests.

38:30.564 --> 38:34.231
It was a risk.

38:39.680 --> 38:43.029
But when you were born,
we felt complete.

38:44.738 --> 38:46.301
You were seven months old...

38:47.612 --> 38:50.004
when the neighbours reported on us.

38:55.991 --> 38:58.212
They came and took you while I was away.

39:03.230 --> 39:05.385
I looked for you for years.

39:06.906 --> 39:08.596
Is she alive?

39:08.923 --> 39:10.854
My mother?

39:25.059 --> 39:26.824
She died nine years ago.

39:26.849 --> 39:28.826
But you have an older brother.

39:34.774 --> 39:36.700
I just wanted the chance...

39:37.470 --> 39:39.253
to meet you and tell you...

39:40.834 --> 39:43.423
if you ever decide you
want to know us...

39:51.021 --> 39:53.142
we would like that very much.

39:57.833 --> 40:00.398
Will he be able to go home?

40:01.329 --> 40:02.861
His abscess is managed,

40:02.886 --> 40:06.340
but it will take some time to see
how he will recover from surgery.

40:06.365 --> 40:07.873
After he's stable,

40:07.898 --> 40:10.725
arrangements will be made
to get him back home.

40:13.213 --> 40:16.289
If I wanted to test for
a stem cell match...

40:16.412 --> 40:17.712
could I?

40:17.737 --> 40:19.003
Of course.

40:19.334 --> 40:21.963
We can use the blood
we've already drawn.

40:23.273 --> 40:24.589
Tell him.

40:38.693 --> 40:40.855
He says, "I don't want that."

40:40.880 --> 40:42.947
- I know.
- "It's not why I've come."

40:42.972 --> 40:44.538
I know.

41:00.302 --> 41:02.769
Whatever it is, make it quick.

41:04.385 --> 41:07.952
Are you still experiencing
post-concussive symptoms, sir?

41:10.410 --> 41:13.892
If there's anything I can
do to help, let me know.

41:25.513 --> 41:26.913
I know...

41:26.938 --> 41:29.560
I know that you're upset I told
Theo about your living situation,

41:29.585 --> 41:30.685
and I should've dropped it,

41:30.710 --> 41:32.482
but I also knew that you
weren't going to ask for help,

41:32.507 --> 41:34.842
- so I made a judgment call...
- Thank you.

41:36.801 --> 41:38.580
You're welcome.

41:39.762 --> 41:41.959
When was the last time
you took a day off?

41:42.546 --> 41:44.139
Um...

41:44.335 --> 41:46.629
Last week, or the week before?

41:46.808 --> 41:48.173
I don't know.

41:48.648 --> 41:51.982
If you did have one, and you
were forced not to work on it,

41:53.839 --> 41:55.450
what would you do?

41:55.597 --> 41:57.231
Oh, my God.

41:57.889 --> 41:59.756
I'd, um...

42:01.131 --> 42:05.240
see the friends that I've been
ignoring since my residency started?

42:05.498 --> 42:06.631
Um.

42:06.926 --> 42:10.945
I'd read a book that
isn't a medical text.

42:12.415 --> 42:14.282
I'd drive to the bluffs,

42:14.628 --> 42:16.535
blare out loud music.

42:17.634 --> 42:19.829
You should do that some time.

42:26.142 --> 42:29.228
Theo was kind enough to help
me move some of our old stuff,

42:29.253 --> 42:32.485
but the rest of it is
in storage for now.

42:32.510 --> 42:34.226
You have your own bedroom.

42:34.251 --> 42:36.829
Theo says Daneesha can come
over whenever she wants,

42:36.854 --> 42:39.169
and that he's very excited

42:39.194 --> 42:43.095
to make us what he calls his
"World famous Mac and Cheese."

42:43.469 --> 42:46.697
I know we're a little further
from school, but, uh...

42:46.886 --> 42:48.566
We're together.

42:55.820 --> 42:57.689
My chair!

43:02.289 --> 43:08.273
