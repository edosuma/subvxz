00:05.172 --> 00:07.107
She was telling me
that she didn't tag you

in because she thinks you suck.

00:08.475 --> 00:09.676
I am so pissed.

What?

00:31.465 --> 00:32.766
You weren't married before.

00:32.766 --> 00:34.635
You don't just run
off and get married

00:34.635 --> 00:36.003
and not tell your
family for 10 years.

00:40.941 --> 00:42.509

00:42.509 --> 00:44.611
been hiding for a long time.

00:44.611 --> 00:48.882
I got married when I was
20, got divorced at 23.

off and get married

01:18.412 --> 01:20.614
He's my only brother,
and he's protective.

01:20.614 --> 01:22.316
So I get it.

01:22.316 --> 01:24.418

so much-- I don't

01:24.418 --> 01:25.919

But that wasn't.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.992
Seeing how my
brother reacted, I'm

01:31.992 --> 01:34.261
just freaking out to tell John.

01:34.261 --> 01:37.197
And it's just making me feel
like I don't know what to do.

We have so much to do.

02:09.329 --> 02:12.966

We also have to let the florists
know all the flowers we need.

the bridesmaids-- I

02:19.072 --> 02:21.041
want them to have daisy halos.

of the ceremony.

02:38.859 --> 02:42.796
Could we trim your beard?

02:42.796 --> 02:45.532
I never thought Brian's
beard would be famous.

02:45.532 --> 02:49.970
But it is exactly what the WWE
universe recognizes him for.

02:49.970 --> 02:53.473
It is a wild-man beard,
and it's kind of, like,

02:53.473 --> 02:54.975
growing into his hair.

02:54.975 --> 02:57.077
I went to store and
just got some wax.

02:57.077 --> 03:01.148
If we just trim the
sides, kind of shape it,

03:01.148 --> 03:03.050
just clean them up
a little bit, he'd

03:03.050 --> 03:04.284
be perfect for the wedding.

03:12.959 --> 03:14.361

that she was married
before my wedding day

08:31.778 --> 08:34.147
so no drama breaks out.

08:34.147 --> 08:36.015
The wedding is
literally weeks away.

You're now feeling tight here.

-Yeah, it feels OK.
-OK.

08:41.654 --> 08:43.356
Yeah, which I love that, but--

It's Brian from the office.

08:47.894 --> 08:48.661
How are you?

08:48.661 --> 08:49.796
Good, Brian.

08:49.796 --> 08:50.597
How are you?

08:50.597 --> 08:50.963
BRIAN TERWILLIGER (ON

08:50.963 --> 08:53.600

update about next week's shoot

08:53.600 --> 08:55.368
for WrestleMania XXX.

08:55.368 --> 08:59.406
Brie and I and Summer and
a few other WWE Superstars

08:59.406 --> 09:03.243
have been chosen to be in
the opening of WrestleMania,

09:03.243 --> 09:04.778
and this is truly an honor.

09:04.778 --> 09:06.579
BRIAN TERWILLIGER (ON PHONE):
We had to move the shoot

09:06.579 --> 09:08.882
from Friday to next Wednesday.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.016
OK.

09:10.016 --> 09:10.817
That's great.

BRIAN TERWILLIGER
(ON PHONE): So we're

09:12.085 --> 09:13.820
gonna get you guys out first

09:13.820 --> 09:16.156
It's a tight turnaround,
but tons of money

09:16.156 --> 09:17.690

-Nice.

Tell him I'm in Sedona.

09:18.491 --> 09:19.125
BRIAN TERWILLIGER (ON

09:19.125 --> 09:20.593
It's gonna look spectacular.

09:20.593 --> 09:21.394
Oh my gosh.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.362
BRIAN TERWILLIGER (ON PHONE):

09:22.362 --> 09:23.430
we'll get you girls in and out.

09:23.430 --> 09:24.230
Awesome.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.131
Thank you so much, Brian.

09:25.131 --> 09:27.867

you for thinking of us.

09:29.302 --> 09:30.270
Take care.

09:30.270 --> 09:31.438
OK, you too, Brian.

09:31.438 --> 09:33.440

09:33.440 --> 09:34.607
Nicole, you have
to be kidding me.

09:34.607 --> 09:35.408
I can't go.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.876
Yes, you can, Brianna.

09:36.876 --> 09:40.914
Nicole, I have to go to
Sedona to look at the venues.

09:40.914 --> 09:41.981
I have to meet the decorator.

09:41.981 --> 09:43.216
We're meeting with
the flower people.

09:43.216 --> 09:46.119
Do you want to be on the
opening of WrestleMania?

09:46.119 --> 09:47.687
All I ever hear you
for so many years

09:47.687 --> 09:49.489
is you want to be a
part of WrestleMania.

09:49.489 --> 09:50.256
Here you go.

09:50.256 --> 09:53.393
But my wedding happens
once in a lifetime.

09:53.393 --> 09:56.196
So unfortunately, I
have to do these things

09:56.196 --> 09:59.499
to make sure that everything
is set for my wedding.

09:59.499 --> 10:00.366
Brie, I'm sorry.

10:00.366 --> 10:03.269
You decided to plan a wedding
during WrestleMania season.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.070
So guess what.

10:04.070 --> 10:05.505
Our career comes first.

10:05.505 --> 10:06.773
You can't sit there
one minute and say

10:06.773 --> 10:08.274
you want to be a top Diva
and then the next minute

10:08.274 --> 10:09.008
say no to stuff.

10:09.008 --> 10:10.677
You just don't get it
because it's not your wedding.

10:10.677 --> 10:12.679
But I'm sure if it was your
wedding, it'd be way different.

10:12.679 --> 10:13.480
OK.

10:13.480 --> 10:15.381
See, the thing is about
a wedding is that it's

10:15.381 --> 10:16.216
a very special moment.

10:16.216 --> 10:16.983
And--

10:16.983 --> 10:17.784
I agree.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.819
No, you don't, because
you don't get it.

10:19.819 --> 10:21.821
What you don't
understand is my dreams--

10:21.821 --> 10:24.357
you know, getting married
and being a mother-- it's

10:24.357 --> 10:26.693
bigger than being a top Diva.

10:26.693 --> 10:28.294
You have the dream for it too.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.763
Mine is coming true.

10:30.763 --> 10:33.133
Don't try to ruin in.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.734
NIKKI BELLA: I can't
believe you'd even say that.

10:34.734 --> 10:38.471
Well, it's the truth, because
you're a selfish bitch.

10:38.471 --> 10:39.706

Here I am in New
Orleans, even though I

12:24.177 --> 12:25.144
was supposed to be in Sedona.

12:25.144 --> 12:29.916
So I'm not really
thinking about you.

12:29.916 --> 12:32.151
Since I have to be
here in New Orleans

12:32.151 --> 12:34.387
to shoot this huge
open for WrestleMania,

12:34.387 --> 12:36.990

my mother to Sedona

12:36.990 --> 12:38.825
to do my wedding scouting.

It's the life we've
always wanted to live.

Oh my god, a clown.

it's the life he chose.

13:07.787 --> 13:08.988
That's what he has to do.

13:08.988 --> 13:09.822
So that's his thing.

13:09.822 --> 13:11.557
Yeah, and he probably
understands it,

13:11.557 --> 13:13.426
that the clown has
to wake up tomorrow

13:13.426 --> 13:16.262
and put the red nose back on
and just has to do those things.

13:16.262 --> 13:17.597
I don't think he's
leaving, because I'm

13:17.597 --> 13:19.799
sure he has something
very important I going on.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.367
I guarantee you it's
his kid's birthday.

13:21.367 --> 13:22.435

13:22.435 --> 13:24.604
--planning a
wedding or has a kid.

13:24.604 --> 13:26.306
Guarantee you the
clown would tell me,

13:26.306 --> 13:27.840
you should be in Sedona
planning your wedding.

13:27.840 --> 13:30.910

14:16.055 --> 14:17.657

14:18.991 --> 14:21.594
like Old MacDonald's farm.

14:21.594 --> 14:24.197
It's what?

14:24.197 --> 14:27.200
The other thing is the ranch.

14:27.200 --> 14:30.002
It looks beautiful, but
there's no restrooms.

14:30.002 --> 14:31.938
So we will have to
rent a porta-potty.

14:35.308 --> 14:36.676
There's no bathrooms?

14:36.676 --> 14:39.412

up, it was like--

16:29.055 --> 16:29.856
It looks really pretty.

16:29.856 --> 16:32.158
I think for Summer, I
want to do the mullet.

16:32.158 --> 16:36.062
Um, speaking of Summer--

16:36.062 --> 16:38.598
So Brie called me
and told me that she

16:38.598 --> 16:41.267
wasn't sure if she wanted to
have Summer at the wedding.

16:41.267 --> 16:42.034
You know, I get it.

16:42.034 --> 16:44.604
My sister's extremely sweet.

16:44.604 --> 16:46.272
She has a big
heart, and I do too.

16:46.272 --> 16:48.040
You know your
wedding is the most

16:48.040 --> 16:49.008
important day of your life.

16:49.008 --> 16:49.809
Mm-hmm.

16:49.809 --> 16:51.377
These day's about
you, and don't

16:51.377 --> 16:52.712
make it about everyone else.

16:52.712 --> 16:54.413
Summer should not be there.

16:54.413 --> 16:57.049
Summer's disrespected Brie
so many times and not only

16:57.049 --> 16:59.919
Brie-- me, our men.

16:59.919 --> 17:02.522
And so why do you want
someone like that at the most

17:02.522 --> 17:03.422
important day of your life.

17:03.422 --> 17:05.290
My sister and I have
talked about this moment

17:05.290 --> 17:06.759
since we've been little girls.

17:06.759 --> 17:09.295
And I will be damned if you
come try to bring your drama.

17:09.295 --> 17:10.128
Do you know what I mean?

17:10.128 --> 17:12.498
Summer only wants to come
to dress in a slutty dress

17:12.498 --> 17:13.665
and get everyone's attention.

17:13.665 --> 17:16.335
Over my dead body will
Summer be at Brie's wedding.

17:20.806 --> 17:23.075
Oh, look at who's here.

17:23.075 --> 17:26.979
I was telling Nattie about how
you're going back and forth

17:26.979 --> 17:28.281
about Summer at the wedding.

17:28.281 --> 17:30.583
And I just said you have to
start thinking about you.

17:30.583 --> 17:31.751
What's gonna make you happy?

17:31.751 --> 17:35.588
Because in the end, do you think
she wants to be there for you?

17:35.588 --> 17:37.857
Just doing it because you
want to make work happy

17:37.857 --> 17:39.125
and you don't want
hurt feelings.

17:39.125 --> 17:40.026
No, but she's hurt yours.

17:40.026 --> 17:42.595
So you have to remember that and
remember this day's about you.

17:42.595 --> 17:44.230
Out of experience,
just from my own wedding

17:44.230 --> 17:48.334
less than a year ago, I regret
trying to make everybody happy.

17:48.334 --> 17:51.337
I was trying to make TJ's
mom happy, my parents happy.

17:51.337 --> 17:52.672
I basically put myself last.

17:52.672 --> 17:55.875
That's the one day you
have to put yourself first.

17:55.875 --> 17:57.076
Just weird 'cause
I never do that.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.044
NATTIE: You're just too nice.

17:58.044 --> 18:03.549
But Brie, being too sometimes
gets you walked all over.

18:03.549 --> 18:06.652
It's your day-- 100% your day.

18:06.652 --> 18:08.554
I'm not going to
let anyone ruin it.

18:08.554 --> 18:09.755
Let's go over the end part.

18:18.331 --> 18:19.599
Mark, Mark, and Mark.

18:22.501 --> 18:23.469

18:23.469 --> 18:25.805
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.473
[GASP] The Mark is here.

18:27.473 --> 18:29.041
How's the wedding
planning going?

18:29.041 --> 18:29.909
Crazy.

18:29.909 --> 18:31.477
How's your eye doing?
NAOMI KNIGHT: Great.

18:31.477 --> 18:32.878
MARK CARRANO: Good?
-Mm-hmm.

18:32.878 --> 18:34.413
Nattie, how's the cat?

18:34.413 --> 18:36.449
"Cat Fancy's" doing
a spread on him.

18:36.449 --> 18:37.383
It's that amazing?

18:37.383 --> 18:38.184
MARK CARRANO: OK.

18:38.184 --> 18:39.619
I'm glad I asked that question.

18:41.420 --> 18:43.289
Well, we've got a lot
going on right now.

18:43.289 --> 18:47.026
I want you all to congratulate
her, because she's earned it.

18:47.026 --> 18:50.663
Summer will be the first
WWE Diva to be featured

18:50.663 --> 18:52.999
in a WWE film, "Marine 4."

18:52.999 --> 18:55.001
WWE Studios has
a very successful

18:55.001 --> 18:56.369
franchise called "The Marine."

18:56.369 --> 18:58.671
They have a hostage-- my wife.

18:58.671 --> 19:00.039
Drop your weapon.

19:00.039 --> 19:02.975
SUMMER RAE (VOICEOVER): No Diva
has ever been in a WWE film.

19:02.975 --> 19:06.012
So I am really looking
forward to this.

19:06.012 --> 19:07.380
MARK CARRANO: It's
gonna be you and Miz.

19:07.380 --> 19:08.180
Congratulations, Summer.

19:08.180 --> 19:09.148
Congratulations, Summer.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.082
That's awesome.

19:10.082 --> 19:12.251
Oh my god, Summer,
that's so awesome.

19:12.251 --> 19:15.955
You deserve that movie so much
for being such a lovely girl.

19:15.955 --> 19:17.256
Anybody want to
go get Summer cake

19:17.256 --> 19:19.025
and celebrate her movie debut?

19:19.025 --> 19:19.959
Absolutely not.

19:20.793 --> 19:21.594
MARK CARRANO: OK.

19:21.594 --> 19:22.928
It's a great time to be a Diva.

19:22.928 --> 19:24.964
You guys are the best of the
best, the cream of the crop,

19:27.466 --> 19:28.234
All right.

19:28.234 --> 19:29.835
So guys, WrestleMania's
coming up.

moment of truth.

We're about to find out
who will be participating

in the WrestleMania match.

It is my time.

JOHN CENA: It seems
you wouldn't come

19:59.899 --> 20:01.934
to me if it wasn't a problem.

20:01.934 --> 20:02.702

John's going to react.

JOHN CENA: So shoot.
What is it now?

20:07.840 --> 20:08.641
Um--

20:11.177 --> 20:13.813
We could put an arch
set up right here.

20:13.813 --> 20:15.581
The trees were kinda
in the way over here.

20:15.581 --> 20:16.649
We can just pull them out.

20:16.649 --> 20:18.250
BRIE BELLA (VOICEOVER):
We could make this work.

20:18.250 --> 20:19.685
It's gonna be really
expensive, but--

being unreasonable.

how to sport an eyepatch,

really, really like her.

We have a standard
hotel style room.

24:09.114 --> 24:10.282
with about 20 other rooms.

24:51.824 --> 24:52.624
Look at it.

24:52.624 --> 24:53.592
NIKKI BELLA: I don't--

24:53.592 --> 24:54.994
He's got some hops.

24:54.994 --> 24:59.031
You were deathly afraid of that.

24:59.031 --> 25:00.132
He jumped at me.

25:00.132 --> 25:03.769
You're the indigenous
population here.

25:03.769 --> 25:05.537
Have a seat.

25:05.537 --> 25:08.474
So what's on your mind?

25:08.474 --> 25:11.643
It seems you wouldn't come
to me if it wasn't a problem.

25:11.643 --> 25:12.978
NIKKI BELLA: True.

25:12.978 --> 25:14.847
NIKKI BELLA (VOICEOVER): I'm
really freaking out inside.

25:14.847 --> 25:16.148
I don't know how
John's going to react.

25:16.148 --> 25:17.950
Shoot.
What is it now?

25:17.950 --> 25:18.751
Um--

25:22.621 --> 25:24.390
NIKKI BELLA (VOICEOVER):
This is it-- the big moment.

25:24.390 --> 25:27.226
Do or die, here I go.

25:27.226 --> 25:29.762
But these are, like,
memories we are making.

25:29.762 --> 25:31.096
$100 per memory?

25:31.096 --> 25:35.701
You want us to spend
$120,000 on a wedding.

25:35.701 --> 25:36.702
Summer.

25:36.702 --> 25:38.170
BRIE BELLA (VOICEOVER): I keep
going back and forth whether I

25:38.170 --> 25:39.238
want her at my wedding or not.

25:39.238 --> 25:41.673
And I need to tell
Summer face to face.

25:41.673 --> 25:43.642
Feeling like you kind
of just start [BLEEP]

25:43.642 --> 25:46.378
behind, like, everyone's
back, it seems like.

25:51.617 --> 25:52.818
JOHN CENA: It seems
you wouldn't come

25:52.818 --> 25:54.987
to me if it wasn't a problem.

25:54.987 --> 25:56.188
NIKKI BELLA: True.

25:56.188 --> 25:56.989
JOHN CENA: So shoot.

25:56.989 --> 25:57.790
What is it now?

25:57.790 --> 25:58.590
Um--

26:01.360 --> 26:02.661
NIKKI BELLA (VOICEOVER):
John knows how

26:02.661 --> 26:04.496
important marriage is to me.

26:04.496 --> 26:08.867
And it just worries me how
he's going to think when

26:08.867 --> 26:10.836
he finds out about my marriage.

26:10.836 --> 26:12.304
Um, Brie.

26:15.374 --> 26:19.178
I'm just kind of
frustrated, bothered.

26:19.178 --> 26:22.714
She's just putting her
wedding before her career.

26:22.714 --> 26:24.383
JOHN CENA: Do you want me
to say something to her?

26:24.383 --> 26:25.584
Maybe.

26:25.584 --> 26:26.385
JOHN CENA: OK.

26:26.385 --> 26:27.753
If it comes to that, I'll do it.

26:27.753 --> 26:30.289
I see how hard you
work every day.

26:30.289 --> 26:32.724
Ugh, I just can't
get the words out.

26:32.724 --> 26:33.625
Not gonna tell him.

26:33.625 --> 26:34.860
I'll wait till
after WrestleMania.

26:34.860 --> 26:35.661
I love you.

26:35.661 --> 26:36.462
Love you too.

26:36.462 --> 26:37.563
[KISSES]

26:37.563 --> 26:38.564
[SIGHS]

26:45.637 --> 26:47.106
BRIE BELLA: OK, put on
your shoes and shirt.

26:47.106 --> 26:48.240
Let's do this.

26:48.240 --> 26:49.741
Today, we're going
to be doing wedding

26:49.741 --> 26:52.611
scouting, finding out where
my ceremony is going to be.

26:52.611 --> 26:55.314
This is, like, what I dreamed
of since I was a little girl.

26:55.314 --> 26:56.248
So what's our schedule?

26:56.248 --> 26:58.851
So let me-- so right
now, we're going to go

26:58.851 --> 26:59.885
get a tour of the property.

26:59.885 --> 27:00.752
OK.

27:00.752 --> 27:01.720
OK.

27:01.720 --> 27:04.022
BRIE BELLA (VOICEOVER): I'm
looking at two places today.

27:04.022 --> 27:05.424
But I can only pick one.

27:05.424 --> 27:08.026
So the first is L'Auberge,
where we're staying at.

27:08.026 --> 27:09.428
How beautiful this is, right?

27:09.428 --> 27:10.529
Beautiful.

27:10.529 --> 27:12.464
And also we're going
to look at the ranch.

27:12.464 --> 27:14.633
Even though my mother
had bad news about it,

27:14.633 --> 27:17.469
I'm thinking, like, those
pictures-- that's what I want.

27:17.469 --> 27:18.270
Hello!

27:18.270 --> 27:19.705
How are you?

27:19.705 --> 27:20.606
This is Josie.

27:20.606 --> 27:22.074
BRIE BELLA: This is Josie, yeah.

27:22.074 --> 27:23.408
Yeah, she'll be in the wedding.

27:23.408 --> 27:24.843
Are you ready to tour around
and take a look at everything?

27:24.843 --> 27:25.811
We are.

27:25.811 --> 27:26.812
We're so excited.

27:26.812 --> 27:28.147
Oh, good.

27:28.147 --> 27:29.715
With this space, this
is where we would

27:29.715 --> 27:31.316
have cocktail hour, basically.

27:31.316 --> 27:32.217
Oh, wow.

27:32.217 --> 27:34.686
If you're going to have that
three-string quartet for your

27:34.686 --> 27:36.021
ceremony, move them up here.

27:36.021 --> 27:36.822
BRIE BELLA: Nice.

27:36.822 --> 27:39.558
We have a string
quartet and a band?

27:39.558 --> 27:40.826
Yeah.

27:40.826 --> 27:42.828
DANIEL BRYAN: We need both?

27:42.828 --> 27:43.629
He's so cute.

27:43.629 --> 27:47.633
All right, we have one
more venue to look at.

27:47.633 --> 27:49.401
So this is the
cottage sidelines.

27:49.401 --> 27:50.269
Oh, this is beautiful.

27:50.269 --> 27:51.069
BRIE BELLA: This is--

27:51.069 --> 27:52.271
TOUR GUIDE: Where
the two chairs are

27:52.271 --> 27:54.339
is kind of where the two of you
will be exchanging your vows.

27:54.339 --> 27:55.140
BRIE AND BRYAN: OK.

27:55.140 --> 27:56.608
BRIE BELLA (VOICEOVER):
Bryan is loving it.

27:56.608 --> 27:58.710
He's loving the
creek, the trees.

27:58.710 --> 27:59.778
It's beautiful.

27:59.778 --> 28:01.446
But it still is a resort.

28:01.446 --> 28:03.782
And I've kind of always
been against that.

28:03.782 --> 28:05.350
BRIE BELLA: Well, I'm
happy I looked at this.

28:05.350 --> 28:08.020
We're gonna go to
the ranch, Jose.

28:08.020 --> 28:08.820
No?

28:08.820 --> 28:10.222
You don't want to go?

28:10.222 --> 28:11.590
[LAUGHTER]

28:16.795 --> 28:17.996
BRIE BELLA: Gosh,
Bryan, look at it.

28:17.996 --> 28:19.398
Oh, that's so pretty.

28:23.602 --> 28:26.238
Oh my gosh, how cute.

28:26.238 --> 28:27.839
Wow, it's beautiful.

28:27.839 --> 28:28.774
Hi, Brie.

28:28.774 --> 28:29.875
BRIE BELLA: Good
to see you gain.

28:29.875 --> 28:31.143
Hi.
Give me a hug.

28:31.143 --> 28:31.944
Congratulations.

28:31.944 --> 28:33.345
Oh, thank you so much.

28:33.345 --> 28:35.847
OK, well, where do we start?

28:35.847 --> 28:37.216
I'll show you.

28:37.216 --> 28:38.917
Well, you have several
choices, really.

28:38.917 --> 28:43.722
We have the middle lawn and then
the emus and our duck field.

28:43.722 --> 28:44.856
This is perfect.

28:44.856 --> 28:46.592
This is exactly what I wanted.

28:46.592 --> 28:47.693
It's beautiful.

28:47.693 --> 28:49.628
There's emus running around.

28:49.628 --> 28:50.429
There's geese.

28:50.429 --> 28:51.363
[GEESE SQUAWKING]

28:51.363 --> 28:53.065
Oh my gosh, if I'm
walking down the aisle

28:53.065 --> 28:55.701
and they were all
following me-- look it.

28:55.701 --> 28:57.236
It has that nature feeling.

28:57.236 --> 28:58.036
[CHUCKLES]

28:58.036 --> 28:59.504
Oh my god.

28:59.504 --> 29:01.907
DANIEL BRYAN: Josie,
that bird would kill you.

29:01.907 --> 29:03.542
STEVE: You can get
married down here.

29:03.542 --> 29:04.343
Oh my god.

29:04.343 --> 29:05.711
I mean, how do you
not come to Sedona

29:05.711 --> 29:07.079
and show your
wedding guests this?

29:07.079 --> 29:08.247
Yeah, that's beautiful.

29:08.247 --> 29:09.681
Yeah.

29:09.681 --> 29:11.183
I'm looking, and
I'm thinking where

29:11.183 --> 29:14.553
I could stick the furniture,
hay bales, caterers.

29:14.553 --> 29:16.722
Like, this could work.

29:16.722 --> 29:19.758
We could pretty much
put maybe, like, an arch

29:19.758 --> 29:20.959
set up right here.

29:20.959 --> 29:23.929
We could ship in
really funky furniture

29:23.929 --> 29:25.063
to go with the ranch setting.

29:25.063 --> 29:26.798
Trees are kinda in
the way over here.

29:26.798 --> 29:28.634
Maybe we can just pull
them out for the ceremony.

29:32.504 --> 29:35.774
I'm mildly concerned about your
grandma using the porta-potty.

29:35.774 --> 29:36.608
Mildly concerned.

29:36.608 --> 29:39.211
Well, our ceremony's only
going to be 45 minutes.

29:39.211 --> 29:41.313
Our people don't even have
to pee if they don't want to.

29:41.313 --> 29:44.016
I feel like you're being
slightly unreasonable.

29:44.016 --> 29:45.417
Do you remember
when you told me--

29:45.417 --> 29:46.218
DANIEL BRYAN: Uh-huh.

29:46.218 --> 29:47.786
--wedding or house?

29:47.786 --> 29:51.923
But I didn't expect the wedding
to cost as much as a house.

29:51.923 --> 29:53.792
Well, I really want it here.

29:53.792 --> 29:55.394
BRIE BELLA (VOICEOVER):
We could make this work.

29:55.394 --> 29:57.129
It's gonna be really expensive.

29:57.129 --> 30:00.299
But I think we can do it.

30:00.299 --> 30:02.267
This is exactly
what I pictured.

30:02.267 --> 30:04.069
Oh my gosh, we could
probably bring in some really

30:04.069 --> 30:05.304
cool church pews.

30:05.304 --> 30:08.106
You know how expensive
that's going to be?

30:08.106 --> 30:08.907
Yeah.

30:08.907 --> 30:11.510
But I mean, this is, like,
once in a lifetime thing.

30:11.510 --> 30:14.913
Right, you said that
about our room last night.

30:14.913 --> 30:18.283
It's not once in a lifetime,
because we're coming back here.

30:18.283 --> 30:19.985
But these are, like,
memories we are making.

30:19.985 --> 30:21.687
Like, these are the things
that we're going to talk

30:21.687 --> 30:23.355
about the rest of our lives.

30:23.355 --> 30:24.856
$700 per memory?

30:24.856 --> 30:26.224
Yeah, because down
the road, I dont'

30:26.224 --> 30:27.893
want to sit there in
10 years and be like,

30:27.893 --> 30:30.495
if I would have just
spent 5,000 more dollars,

30:30.495 --> 30:32.798
I could've really just
had it perfect like this.

30:32.798 --> 30:35.634
Right, but we're not talking
about 5,000 more dollars.

30:35.634 --> 30:40.272
Do you want us to spend
$120,000 on a wedding?

30:40.272 --> 30:41.773
Do you?

30:41.773 --> 30:46.244
We're not trying to impress
people with the wedding.

30:46.244 --> 30:47.612
Right?

30:47.612 --> 30:49.448
Yeah.

30:49.448 --> 30:51.483
I guess it's, like,
I keep thinking

30:51.483 --> 30:54.319
about everyone else instead of
myself, because I am simple.

30:54.319 --> 30:56.655
Like, I am the type
of girl who can just

30:56.655 --> 31:01.927
be in this dress and these
boots and meet you in the woods

31:01.927 --> 31:02.728
and get married.

31:02.728 --> 31:03.528
But I just want--

31:03.528 --> 31:05.997
We should.

31:05.997 --> 31:07.666
Right now.

31:07.666 --> 31:10.569
Right now.

31:10.569 --> 31:12.471
You're that kind of girl
and I'm that type of guy.

31:12.471 --> 31:13.271
I am, but I do--

31:13.271 --> 31:14.439
So let's just do it.

31:14.439 --> 31:15.374
Let's just do it right now.

31:15.374 --> 31:17.876
We can pull over right
now in these trees.

31:22.814 --> 31:25.283
I'm so excited!

31:25.283 --> 31:26.284
Nattie.

31:26.284 --> 31:27.753
You're looking at the
new Divas champion.

31:27.753 --> 31:30.422
I really look good?

31:30.422 --> 31:31.456
Sorry about lying.

31:31.456 --> 31:34.726
You know, for now, I
must be truthful and just

31:34.726 --> 31:35.894
attack everything together.

31:35.894 --> 31:39.231
You do have John now, so-- by
the way, how did he take it?

31:39.231 --> 31:41.566
I'm just digging
this deep hole.

31:46.972 --> 31:48.006
DANIEL BRYAN: Let's just do it.

31:48.006 --> 31:48.940
Let's just do it right now.

31:48.940 --> 31:51.676
We can pull over right
now in these trees.

31:55.547 --> 31:56.348
No man.

31:56.348 --> 31:57.783
It would be so sad.

31:57.783 --> 31:58.583
Yeah.

31:58.583 --> 32:01.319
And the thing is, is
that I guess I just

32:01.319 --> 32:03.388
want everyone to feel
like they're at a really,

32:03.388 --> 32:04.856
like, neat wedding.

32:04.856 --> 32:08.093
I feel it, one, the
most important thing

32:08.093 --> 32:11.663
is not how it looks
or anything like that.

32:11.663 --> 32:14.499
The most important thing is that
you and I are getting married,

32:14.499 --> 32:15.634
right?
-That's true.

32:15.634 --> 32:17.135
And it's most--
the most important

32:17.135 --> 32:20.138
things are having our family
and our friends there.

32:20.138 --> 32:22.207
It's a celebration for us.

32:22.207 --> 32:23.542
It's about us.
-Yeah.

32:23.542 --> 32:24.342
DANIEL BRYAN: Right?

32:24.342 --> 32:26.244
Yeah, I don't want to
take away from that.

32:26.244 --> 32:27.779
The whole time,
I've been thinking

32:27.779 --> 32:28.914
about my wedding guests.

32:28.914 --> 32:31.383
I haven't been thinking
about the man I'm marrying.

32:31.383 --> 32:33.485
And it truly is what it's about.

32:33.485 --> 32:34.920
L'Auberge?

32:34.920 --> 32:36.021
Deal?

32:36.021 --> 32:37.255
Deal.

32:37.255 --> 32:38.156
Yes, L'Auberge.

32:38.156 --> 32:40.459
It will be
convenient, beautiful.

32:40.459 --> 32:42.494
And it will be my dream wedding.

32:42.494 --> 32:44.629
Our dream wedding.

32:44.629 --> 32:45.430
Your dream wedding.

32:45.430 --> 32:48.400
No, our dream wedding.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.101
BRIE BELLA (VOICEOVER):
Bryan is going to promise me

32:50.101 --> 32:51.670
that he's going to be
the most amazing husband

probably related to you,

BRIE BELLA (VOICEOVER):
After talking to Bryan,

38:30.074 --> 38:33.311
I just kind of realized that a
wedding day is something that

38:33.311 --> 38:35.814
should be intimate, personal.

38:35.814 --> 38:38.516
And to be honest, it should
be only your close family

38:38.516 --> 38:39.984
and friends there.

38:39.984 --> 38:41.419
And Summer isn't that.

38:41.419 --> 38:44.422
So this is really
hard for me to say.

38:44.422 --> 38:47.892
But [SIGH] I just kinda
came to the conclusion

38:47.892 --> 38:49.861
that I just don't want
you at my wedding.

38:54.265 --> 38:56.234
I'm, like, freaking out.

kinda thrown into the fire.

38:59.204 --> 39:01.840
And I'm still trying to
adjust and learn on the go.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.608
It's going to be millions
of people around the world

39:03.608 --> 39:04.542
that are going to watch you.

39:04.542 --> 39:06.711
So if you make a mistake,
it's there forever.

39:16.287 --> 39:18.756
So when we first
started, I really

39:18.756 --> 39:22.126
felt like we had,
like, a friendship

39:22.126 --> 39:23.161
and, like, everything was cool.

39:23.161 --> 39:24.929
And then after everything
happened with Bryan,

39:24.929 --> 39:29.667
it really just made me start,
like, feeling like-- that I

39:29.667 --> 39:31.069
couldn't trust you.

39:31.069 --> 39:34.272
And you kind of just
start [BLEEP] behind,

39:34.272 --> 39:36.908
like, everyone's
back, it seems like.

39:36.908 --> 39:39.210
And I just kind of
came to the conclusion

39:39.210 --> 39:41.479
that I just don't want
you at my wedding.

39:41.479 --> 39:42.580
Oh.

39:42.580 --> 39:45.149
I mean, that's your opinion.

39:45.149 --> 39:45.984
I get that.

39:45.984 --> 39:50.255
I mean, this is, like, a
really special day to me.

39:50.255 --> 39:51.055
Totally.

39:51.055 --> 39:53.458
And I just don't want
there to be any drama.

39:53.458 --> 39:55.059
Yeah, and I want you
to know I would never

39:55.059 --> 39:56.261
start drama at your wedding.
Like--

39:56.261 --> 39:57.061
Yeah.

39:57.061 --> 39:59.464
That sucks that you would
think I would do that.

39:59.464 --> 40:01.232
But I've had no choice
but to think this,

40:01.232 --> 40:02.834
and I don't want to.

40:02.834 --> 40:04.369
SUMMER RAE (VOICEOVER):
This really hurts.

40:04.369 --> 40:06.571
Sure, I don't get along
with the other girls.

40:06.571 --> 40:09.307
But I didn't think
that I had burned

40:09.307 --> 40:10.808
the bridges to this extent.

40:10.808 --> 40:13.745
I guess, like, the reason
why I talk bad about people

40:13.745 --> 40:16.948
is because I'm, I guess,
like, insecure in some way.

40:16.948 --> 40:19.317
And, like, with you
and your sister,

40:19.317 --> 40:21.319
I'm just now starting
off in my career.

40:21.319 --> 40:23.087
And, like, you guys have
accomplished so much

40:23.087 --> 40:24.122
and are the same age.

40:24.122 --> 40:25.490
BRIE BELLA: And that's
the thing with you

40:25.490 --> 40:28.660
is, like, I know there's this
really good person inside.

40:28.660 --> 40:29.460
Yeah.

40:29.460 --> 40:31.296
I guess it's just, like,
my defense mechanism.

40:31.296 --> 40:33.298
Like, I think, like,
coming into this,

40:33.298 --> 40:36.267
like, everyone's, like,
talked bad about everyone.

40:36.267 --> 40:38.169
And, like, I see all the girls,
like, running their mouth.

40:38.169 --> 40:40.004
And, like, when you
first meet someone,

40:40.004 --> 40:41.706
you meet like a
representation of,

40:41.706 --> 40:43.741
like, who they want to portray.

40:43.741 --> 40:45.410
And then eventually you
see their true colors.

40:45.410 --> 40:49.147
So, like, for me, who I am
now is a bad representation

40:49.147 --> 40:51.649
of that, because,
yeah, I do run my mouth

40:51.649 --> 40:53.051
and talk crap about everyone.

40:53.051 --> 40:55.153
But it's only because
I feel like it's

40:55.153 --> 40:56.654
just me against you all.

40:56.654 --> 40:59.657
You don't have to
be fake or phony.

40:59.657 --> 41:01.192
Just be you.

41:01.192 --> 41:02.260
Yeah.

41:02.260 --> 41:03.328
I don't like seeing you cry.

41:03.328 --> 41:04.595
[CHUCKLES]

41:04.595 --> 41:07.065
I hate that actually.

41:07.065 --> 41:08.766
Usually I could
give two [BLEEP] what

41:08.766 --> 41:09.867
other girls think about me.

41:09.867 --> 41:11.869
But it sucks.

41:11.869 --> 41:14.939
Like, I need to be
humble sometimes.

41:14.939 --> 41:16.407
I just need to change my ways.

41:16.407 --> 41:19.210
I need to prove
myself to these women.

41:19.210 --> 41:20.778
It's your reputation.

41:20.778 --> 41:23.815

you have to remember.

or whatever the backstage rumors

41:28.186 --> 41:29.887

I'm, like, freaking out.

41:53.011 --> 41:54.879
This is my first real Mania.

41:54.879 --> 41:55.680
So--

41:55.680 --> 41:57.482
Oh my god, I forgot that this
is your first WrestleMania.

41:57.482 --> 41:57.847
This is the first one, yeah.

41:57.847 --> 41:59.117
Well, you're only
gonna be performing

41:59.117 --> 42:02.186
in front of 80,000 people live.

42:02.186 --> 42:03.588
So I hope you're ready.

42:03.588 --> 42:06.457
A normal person
usually spends at least

42:06.457 --> 42:08.092
two years in developmental.

42:08.092 --> 42:11.462
And in my case, I've
probably had maybe a month.

42:11.462 --> 42:12.563
NATTIE: It's
basically the mecca.

42:12.563 --> 42:13.865
It's like you can't
get-- it doesn't

42:13.865 --> 42:14.565
get any bigger than this.

42:14.565 --> 42:15.366
It doesn't, it doesn't.

42:15.366 --> 42:17.502
So it's 80,000 live.

42:17.502 --> 42:19.871
But it's going to be millions
and millions and millions

42:19.871 --> 42:21.839
and millions of people
around the world

42:21.839 --> 42:24.442
in over 160 different countries
that are going to watch you.

42:24.442 --> 42:26.911
And then because
this is being filmed,

42:26.911 --> 42:30.214
it's going to be extra
the time forever.

42:30.214 --> 42:32.283
So if you make a
mistake, it's there

42:32.283 --> 42:33.985
forever until the end of time.

42:33.985 --> 42:35.086
But you're going to do fine.

42:35.086 --> 42:37.722
Just relax.

42:37.722 --> 42:40.158
I get nervous, and I've
been doing this a lot

42:40.158 --> 42:40.958
longer than you have.

42:40.958 --> 42:42.627
And I have experience.

42:42.627 --> 42:45.663
And, like, I feel like I
thrive on that nervous energy.

42:45.663 --> 42:47.498
Like, I like it.

42:47.498 --> 42:49.467
This is a very big deal.

42:49.467 --> 42:51.436
And you only have
that one chance

42:51.436 --> 42:53.905
to make that first
impression to those people.

42:53.905 --> 42:55.406
And so it's a
make-or-break thing.

42:55.406 --> 42:57.875
[CROWD CHEERING]

42:57.875 --> 43:01.412
We got a nice little lineup.

43:01.412 --> 43:04.382
WrestleMania is in two days.

43:04.382 --> 43:07.351
This is insane.

43:07.351 --> 43:10.822
I don't know if I can do this.

43:10.822 --> 43:13.825
ANNOUNCER: Next on the season
finale of "Total Divas."

43:13.825 --> 43:15.793
COMMENTATOR: This
is WrestleMania!

43:15.793 --> 43:16.794
Please rise.

43:16.794 --> 43:18.763
My wedding day is finally here.

43:18.763 --> 43:20.465
Watching you walk down
that aisle is the happiest

43:20.465 --> 43:21.265
I've ever been.

43:21.265 --> 43:23.201
PASTOR: You may kiss your bride.

43:23.201 --> 43:24.202
Yes!

43:24.202 --> 43:25.002
Yes!

43:25.002 --> 43:27.672
For her to tell you that
she's been married before,

43:27.672 --> 43:29.340
I got to give you kudos, but--

43:29.340 --> 43:30.141
Thank you.

43:30.141 --> 43:31.142
Yeah.

43:31.142 --> 43:33.611
I rarely ever see
John like this.

43:33.611 --> 43:34.612
Who said you told him?

43:34.612 --> 43:37.849
Why would you go say
something to him about that?
