00:50.166 --> 00:52.833
[woman] Last night,
I dreamt I went to Manderley again.

00:53.625 --> 00:57.916
I dreamt that where our drive once lay,
a dark and tortured jungle grew.

00:58.791 --> 01:04.250
Nature had come into her own
and yet the house still stood.

01:05.083 --> 01:05.958
Manderley.

01:06.708 --> 01:09.333
Secretive and silent
as it had always been.

01:09.958 --> 01:11.875
Risen from the dead.

01:13.416 --> 01:14.458
[pistol cocking]

01:15.791 --> 01:19.250
Like all dreamers, I was allowed
to pass through my memory.

01:19.916 --> 01:21.625
Spanning the years like a bridge.

01:23.916 --> 01:29.625
Back to that summer in Monte Carlo
when I knew nothing and had no prospects.

01:44.250 --> 01:45.125
Did you say eight?

01:45.208 --> 01:46.625
-[driver] Huit.
-Yes.

01:49.416 --> 01:51.125
-[driver] Merci. Au revoir.
-Au revoir.

01:57.916 --> 02:00.541
[woman] I can see
the girl I was so clearly,

02:00.625 --> 02:02.916
even if I no longer recognize her.

02:06.625 --> 02:09.666
And I wonder what my life
would have been without Mrs. Van Hopper.

02:11.666 --> 02:13.000
Without that job.

02:14.041 --> 02:15.916
Funny to think
that the course of my existence

02:16.000 --> 02:18.333
hung like a thread upon her curiosity.

02:19.750 --> 02:22.666
If it wasn't for her,
I would never have gone to Manderley...

02:23.833 --> 02:25.500
and would never have met you.

02:26.583 --> 02:27.666
Mrs. Van Hopper.

02:28.583 --> 02:30.083
[Mrs. Van Hopper] What kept you?

02:30.166 --> 02:33.833
I'm sorry. I had to wait
for a package at the post office. I...

02:34.291 --> 02:35.541
I believe it's from your nephew.

02:35.625 --> 02:39.458
Oh, photographs of his honeymoon
with that ghastly girl, I imagine.

02:39.541 --> 02:40.375
Open it.

02:40.958 --> 02:44.625
-Get a table downstairs for lunch.
-Yes. One o'clock as usual?

02:44.708 --> 02:48.208
-Now. I've just seen Maxim de Winter.
-Oh, right.

02:48.291 --> 02:50.000
Still heartbroken, by the look of it.

02:50.083 --> 02:51.666
He's a friend of yours?

02:52.250 --> 02:55.000
Maxim de Winter, owner of Manderley.

02:55.666 --> 02:58.125
-One of the finest homes in England.
-Oh, yes.

02:58.208 --> 03:00.833
His wife died last year.
He's in dire need of company.

03:01.416 --> 03:04.625
-Have the maître d' seat him next to me.
-Oh.

03:09.666 --> 03:10.875
You'll have to tip.

03:14.666 --> 03:16.833
Honestly, with everything
I'm teaching you,

03:16.916 --> 03:17.916
you ought to be paying me.

03:18.833 --> 03:20.875
-Thank you, Mrs. Van Hopper.
-Stupid girl.

03:22.416 --> 03:24.416
[patrons speaking French]

03:28.875 --> 03:30.416
-Bonjour.
-Mademoiselle.

03:30.500 --> 03:32.875
Ah! Madam Van Hopper's usual table?

03:32.958 --> 03:34.416
Oh, yes, thank you. Merci.

03:34.500 --> 03:35.750
Oh, no. Um...

03:35.833 --> 03:39.750
Wait, sorry. She was wondering
if a Mr. de Winter could sit with her.

03:39.833 --> 03:41.875
-Monsieur Maxim de Winter?
-Oui.

03:42.500 --> 03:45.416
It is the choice of Mr. de Winter
where he wishes to be seated.

03:45.500 --> 03:46.958
Oh, yes, of course.

03:47.625 --> 03:48.458
Merci.

03:50.041 --> 03:53.375
[stammers] So sorry. Is that not enough?
Um, here. I've got more.

03:53.458 --> 03:54.958
-Oh!
-[coins clink]

03:55.041 --> 03:57.000
God, I'm so sorry, monsieur.

03:57.875 --> 03:59.333
[sighs] Just one moment.

03:59.416 --> 04:01.625
Don't do it.
I've heard he's a terrible bore.

04:02.208 --> 04:04.958
-Excuse me?
-This de Winter chap.

04:05.041 --> 04:05.916
Thank you.

04:07.833 --> 04:10.416
[maître d'] Monsieur de Winter,
please, this way.

04:24.541 --> 04:26.666
Des huîtres, une douzaine.

04:26.750 --> 04:28.000
"Des huîtres, une douzaine."

04:28.083 --> 04:34.041
Maxim de Winter. Well, I never.
I had no idea you were in Monte.

04:34.125 --> 04:35.875
You must join us.

04:35.958 --> 04:40.208
Edie Van Hopper.
I think you remember my nephew. Billy?

04:40.291 --> 04:43.833
You met him at Blenheim last fall.
Billy Whitney. He's about my height.

04:43.916 --> 04:47.375
He's got sandy hair
and he's got a bit of a lazy eye.

04:47.458 --> 04:50.416
I can't imagine how I could've forgotten.
Do give my regards to Billy.

04:50.500 --> 04:51.625
Oh, would you know?

04:51.708 --> 04:55.041
He's married,
and to the most enchanting girl.

04:55.125 --> 04:56.250
-Is he?
-He sent photographs.

04:56.333 --> 04:58.958
I'll show you. Come here.
The wedding was divine.

04:59.041 --> 05:01.125
I believe you,
but I prefer to lunch alone.

05:02.458 --> 05:04.458
-Good day, Miss Van Hopper.
-Oh, no.

05:04.541 --> 05:08.083
What? We're not related. She's staff.

05:11.208 --> 05:14.125
Well, I mean,
I guess you could call her my ward.

05:14.208 --> 05:17.333
Hmm, I see. Now, if you'll excuse me.

05:17.416 --> 05:20.666
Darling, fetch those photographs.
Mr. de Winter would love to see them.

05:20.750 --> 05:22.708
No, please. Don't trouble yourself.

05:22.791 --> 05:25.166
-It's unnecessary.
-No trouble at all!

05:25.250 --> 05:29.291
Not at all. Go along. Quickly.
No, no. She'll be down in a jiffy.

05:34.958 --> 05:36.666
[women laughing]

05:42.750 --> 05:44.458
[Mrs. Van Hopper]
This is my favorite part.

05:44.541 --> 05:46.583
I asked her to get the photographs,

05:46.666 --> 05:50.625
and she darts from the table,
and then she's gone. Doesn't come back.

05:50.708 --> 05:53.250
I thought, "Oh, God, don't tell me
she started sketching."

05:53.333 --> 05:55.625
-[all laughing]
-Oh, no, she's an artist.

05:56.375 --> 06:01.416
Anyway, she comes running back down,
reeking of cheap rose water.

06:04.625 --> 06:06.166
I mean, the smell of it!

06:07.208 --> 06:10.250
Show me an eligible bachelor

06:10.333 --> 06:16.291
and I will show you a room full of women
acting like they've lost their minds.

06:18.000 --> 06:18.875
It's too late.

06:19.458 --> 06:20.791
-Sorry.
-Never mind, sit down.

06:21.458 --> 06:24.041
Related. I mean, imagine.

06:24.125 --> 06:28.041
I loved the Manderley ball.
It was just so glamorous.

06:28.125 --> 06:30.250
I suppose
that's all stopped since the tragedy.

06:30.333 --> 06:33.000
Such a shocking thing that happened.

06:33.083 --> 06:34.791
-How do you explain it?
-[woman 1] Awful.

06:34.875 --> 06:36.791
-[woman 2] He adored her!
-[woman 3] Mmm.

06:36.875 --> 06:38.000
His Rebecca.

06:44.750 --> 06:46.416
[Mademoiselle] Morning, Mrs. Van Hopper.

06:46.500 --> 06:47.875
[groaning]

06:51.166 --> 06:53.541
-Mrs. Van Hopper?
-[groans]

06:53.625 --> 06:54.708
Are you all right?

06:54.791 --> 06:57.291
[Mrs. Van Hopper incoherently] I'm sick.
I'm sick.

06:57.375 --> 07:01.958
I'm... I was sick all night.

07:02.041 --> 07:04.875
-Call the... call the medecin.
-Okay.

07:06.250 --> 07:09.416
-Call them right now. The doctor.
-All right.

07:10.708 --> 07:13.083
Where is the bucket? Where's the bucket?

07:13.166 --> 07:15.625
-I'll get the bucket! Here, I've got it.
-[vomits]

07:18.916 --> 07:20.541
You are waiting for madame?

07:20.625 --> 07:23.583
Oh, no. She's unwell.
The doctor told her to rest.

07:23.666 --> 07:25.041
So, it's just me today.

07:25.125 --> 07:28.500
It is not possible.
The terrace is for guests only.

07:29.500 --> 07:33.083
But I'm a lady's companion... really?

07:33.166 --> 07:34.875
Yes, it is not for staff.

07:38.541 --> 07:42.291
Monsieur? The young lady will be
joining me. Set another place, please.

07:42.375 --> 07:43.958
[maître d'] Bien sûr, Monsieur de Winter.

07:44.041 --> 07:45.791
[in English] No, please.
I couldn't possibly.

07:45.875 --> 07:47.250
It's absolutely fine.

07:47.333 --> 07:49.958
-We needn't talk unless we feel like it.
-Oh.

07:51.125 --> 07:54.208
You... you didn't have to do that.

07:54.291 --> 07:56.458
My motives were entirely selfish.

07:56.541 --> 07:59.375
This is yesterday's paper.
I've already read it.

08:01.041 --> 08:02.416
Thank you. It's very kind.

08:05.750 --> 08:09.166
-So, what is it you do for...
-I'm what's called "a lady's companion."

08:09.750 --> 08:12.708
If a lady has to pay for company,
that says something about the lady.

08:14.875 --> 08:16.208
[maître d'] May I take your order?

08:17.250 --> 08:19.500
Des huîtres, une douzaine.

08:19.583 --> 08:20.958
For breakfast?

08:21.041 --> 08:23.375
You heard her. Et encore du café.

08:23.458 --> 08:25.833
Bien, Monsieur de Winter. Mademoiselle.

08:28.041 --> 08:31.291
If it's not rude, why her?

08:32.000 --> 08:34.875
You would make an excellent
companion for any number of people.

08:34.958 --> 08:38.333
I've always wanted to travel,
so there's that, and £90 a year.

08:40.833 --> 08:43.875
I know that's not very much to you,
but it's a lot to me.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.208
I suppose you can
set a price on loneliness.

08:47.291 --> 08:50.291
It's odd, isn't it?
Some people seem perfectly happy alone

08:50.375 --> 08:53.833
while others just need someone
to pass the time with. Doesn't matter who.

08:54.916 --> 08:55.875
Which are you?

08:55.958 --> 09:00.833
Well, my parents are dead, so...
I'm used to being alone.

09:03.083 --> 09:03.916
Ah.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Here comes your breakfast.

09:07.375 --> 09:09.541
Et voilà. Une douzaine d'huîtres.

09:11.666 --> 09:13.666
-I've always wanted to try them, so...
-[chuckles]

09:14.416 --> 09:15.708
Try them before they get warm.

09:20.583 --> 09:22.583
-[jazz music playing]
-[indistinct chatter]

09:24.291 --> 09:25.375
[laughter]

09:32.416 --> 09:35.416
Thank you so much.
I've never spoken so much in my life.

09:35.500 --> 09:36.916
-It was very impressive.
-[chuckles]

09:37.000 --> 09:40.458
-And I'm sorry about the oysters, too. I--
-No, that was fine.

09:41.083 --> 09:42.541
Thank you very much. I...

09:42.625 --> 09:45.458
I haven't enjoyed myself
like that for quite a long time.

09:49.583 --> 09:50.625
À bientôt.

10:11.541 --> 10:12.541
[Mrs. Van Hopper] Hello?

10:13.166 --> 10:14.583
-[groaning]
-[knocking at door]

10:17.250 --> 10:19.708
-A note from the front desk.
-Merci. Madame's indisposed.

10:19.791 --> 10:21.791
-I'll take it to her.
-It's for you, mademoiselle.

10:23.541 --> 10:24.375
Merci.

10:27.083 --> 10:29.375
[Mrs. Van Hopper] What do they want?

10:31.000 --> 10:31.833
Um...

10:32.833 --> 10:34.875
It was just the front desk, they were...

10:36.666 --> 10:37.916
wondering how you are.

10:56.791 --> 10:58.208
[Maxim] So how did you escape?

10:58.291 --> 11:01.458
I said I had a tennis lesson.
She's been on at me to improve my game.

11:01.541 --> 11:02.458
Sneaky.

11:05.250 --> 11:07.791
-So where do you want to go?
-Anywhere is fine.

11:07.875 --> 11:10.041
[Maxim] There must be
somewhere you want to see.

11:10.125 --> 11:11.666
[Mademoiselle] Well, it's quite far.

11:12.208 --> 11:14.291
[Maxim] Good. I could use the fresh air.

11:14.958 --> 11:16.791
[Mademoiselle] Is this
a 3.5-liter Bentley?

11:16.875 --> 11:19.125
[Maxim] It is.
How do you know so much about cars?

11:19.208 --> 11:22.291
[Mademoiselle] Oh, my father,
he loved them.

11:22.875 --> 11:25.458
[Maxim] If I may ask,
when did your parents pass away?

11:27.000 --> 11:28.750
Two winters ago. Influenza.

11:28.833 --> 11:30.958
Well, my mother
died of influenza, and my...

11:31.875 --> 11:33.916
father died just four days later.

11:36.458 --> 11:38.708
Do you think a person
could die of a broken heart?

11:42.916 --> 11:46.208
-That was thoughtless of me. I'm sorry.
-No.

11:46.916 --> 11:48.458
-[car honking]
-[Mademoiselle shrieks]

11:52.250 --> 11:54.208
-[exhales]
-It's all right.

11:55.125 --> 11:56.666
All part of the plan.

11:58.541 --> 11:59.375
[chuckles]

11:59.458 --> 12:01.541
EXOTIC GARDEN
PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING

12:07.708 --> 12:10.000
[Mademoiselle] There's a cactus,
it's native to Mexico,

12:10.083 --> 12:12.833
and it grows to 65 feet tall.

12:12.916 --> 12:16.708
It lives for 200 years,
but it doesn't flower until it's 70.

12:16.791 --> 12:19.125
[chuckles] Where do you learn this stuff?

12:19.208 --> 12:21.833
I read about it.
Everything I know is from books.

12:21.916 --> 12:27.291
I haven't really experienced anything yet.
I plan to before I'm old.

12:35.583 --> 12:36.583
Look!

12:51.875 --> 12:53.250
Have you been here before?

12:55.375 --> 12:59.083
Years ago. On my honeymoon.

13:07.916 --> 13:11.541
-How did your wife--
-Please... let's not.

13:42.166 --> 13:43.541
[Mademoiselle] Mr. de Winter.

13:47.750 --> 13:49.375
-Go on.
-Oh, no. I couldn't.

13:49.458 --> 13:52.250
Yes. Yes, you can.
You know how, don't you?

13:52.333 --> 13:54.875
Um, well, yes, I--

13:54.958 --> 13:57.416
Well, good.
As long as you didn't learn from a book.

14:01.291 --> 14:02.708
-[honks]
-[Mademoiselle chuckles]

14:03.375 --> 14:06.666
Will you tell me about Manderley?
I hear it's beautiful.

14:06.750 --> 14:11.666
It is. Yeah. Manderley,
it's more than a house. It's my life.

14:12.250 --> 14:15.791
It's been passed from father to son
and father to son for centuries.

14:16.416 --> 14:17.791
Until now, anyway.

14:19.208 --> 14:23.250
You see, if I die without an heir,
it goes to my sister.

14:23.333 --> 14:27.166
And her sons are nice boys,
but they're just not de Winters.

14:37.041 --> 14:39.416
-[Maxim exhales]
-[Mademoiselle chuckles]

14:39.500 --> 14:40.375
There we go.

14:40.458 --> 14:43.083
Well, thank you
for getting us home safely.

14:43.166 --> 14:44.750
Don't forget your things.

14:46.166 --> 14:47.250
Sir, give us a hand?

14:49.583 --> 14:51.041
This is what I need from you.

14:51.125 --> 14:54.125
Would you grab that bag
and just lift at the same time?

14:54.791 --> 14:56.333
One, two, three.

15:00.208 --> 15:01.666
Put that back, please.

15:01.750 --> 15:03.625
Yes, of course. I'm sorry. I...

15:04.333 --> 15:06.625
Leave the keys with the valet. Good night.

15:07.500 --> 15:08.583
[Mademoiselle] Good night.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.291
[Mrs. Van Hopper weakly] Hello.

15:24.250 --> 15:26.500
The nurse left an hour ago.

15:27.333 --> 15:31.125
[stammers] The tennis coach only had
a late session free...

15:32.500 --> 15:34.666
and I was practicing my serve.

15:36.916 --> 15:39.291
A tennis lesson in the dark?

15:41.291 --> 15:42.125
Yes.

15:49.916 --> 15:52.708
[softly] Rebecca from Max.
Max from Rebecca.

15:52.791 --> 15:56.708
You stupid girl.
Why would I look at his personal book?

16:09.208 --> 16:11.208
[patrons chatting indistinctly]

16:18.375 --> 16:20.500
For you. From Monsieur de Winter.

16:35.833 --> 16:38.750
[Mademoiselle gasps] Pour moi? Merci.

16:44.791 --> 16:46.875
-I'm off.
-[Mrs. Van Hopper] What have you got on?

16:46.958 --> 16:48.541
I can see right through it.

16:48.625 --> 16:49.500
Oh.

16:49.583 --> 16:52.416
-You wearing any undergarments?
-Yes, of course.

17:00.208 --> 17:03.125
I'm trying to paint beautiful houses.

17:03.208 --> 17:07.583
Actually, you don't need
your tennis racket. All right.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.250
[man] Mademoiselle.

17:11.500 --> 17:12.458
Merci.

17:25.208 --> 17:27.750
-[Mademoiselle] What are you doing?
-[Maxim] Oh, you'll see.

17:35.291 --> 17:39.708
Imagine if you could
bottle a memory like scent.

17:42.375 --> 17:44.833
Then, whenever you wanted,
you could open it.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.458
It'd be like
living the moment all over again.

17:50.875 --> 17:54.583
And what particular moments
in your young life would you bottle?

17:55.750 --> 17:58.333
This week. Now. Every minute of it.

18:00.500 --> 18:01.708
Never forget it.

18:04.541 --> 18:08.041
And any memories you didn't want,
you could simply throw away.

18:12.541 --> 18:13.958
[Mademoiselle] "Come for a drive."

18:14.041 --> 18:15.250
"Lunch at the Cap."

18:17.041 --> 18:18.125
The beach.

18:32.208 --> 18:34.250
[Maxim] But I love the coast down here.

18:35.750 --> 18:36.875
It's so beautiful.

18:38.666 --> 18:39.916
Oh, there we go!

18:40.000 --> 18:41.458
What are you looking at?

18:41.541 --> 18:44.750
-Um, well, it's...
-Let me see.

18:45.333 --> 18:46.625
I wouldn't if I were you.

18:46.708 --> 18:48.958
No...
Well, it's just as well you're not...

18:55.666 --> 18:57.875
-[gasps] Sorry.
-That's all right.

18:59.333 --> 19:01.291
[Mademoiselle] Come on.
Let's go for a swim.

19:02.541 --> 19:04.833
[chuckling] Come on. Come on!

19:05.666 --> 19:08.125
-[shouts] Come in!
-No!

19:08.208 --> 19:10.541
-[Mademoiselle] Why not?
-I don't want to!

19:10.625 --> 19:12.166
[Mademoiselle]  What are you afraid of?

19:12.250 --> 19:15.458
It's too cold. No, it's freezing.

19:15.541 --> 19:17.291
[Mademoiselle] No, it's not.
It's lovely!

19:17.375 --> 19:19.958
[Maxim] I can feel it. It's freezing cold!

19:20.916 --> 19:23.666
-You come here!
-No. I'm gonna drink all the champagne.

19:23.750 --> 19:25.083
[Mademoiselle] I don't care!

19:25.166 --> 19:27.416
[Maxim] God! Look
at what you're making me do.

19:30.166 --> 19:31.416
[Mademoiselle laughs]

19:37.291 --> 19:39.291
[soft piano music playing]

20:56.541 --> 20:57.583
Oh, you're up.

20:58.708 --> 20:59.625
I, um...

21:01.250 --> 21:04.458
[stammering] I'm so glad
you're feeling better. Where's the nurse?

21:05.291 --> 21:06.500
Dismissed.

21:08.291 --> 21:11.125
Took a swim, I see. After tennis?

21:12.458 --> 21:13.416
Yes.

21:14.583 --> 21:17.625
Well, go on. Dry your hair. Chop-chop.

21:18.583 --> 21:20.083
Are we going down for dinner?

21:21.458 --> 21:22.666
I am.

21:22.750 --> 21:26.250
You can see the concierge about
booking us on the early train tomorrow.

21:26.333 --> 21:28.125
And you can set about packing.

21:29.083 --> 21:30.291
Um, tomorrow?

21:30.375 --> 21:33.875
Billy is sailing for New York on Saturday.
We can catch the same boat.

21:34.458 --> 21:37.000
I'm sick to death of Europe.

21:40.541 --> 21:41.541
[laughs]

21:42.541 --> 21:44.583
Don't look at me like a drowned rat.

21:44.666 --> 21:46.791
You'll get used to New York fast enough.

21:47.583 --> 21:49.875
Plenty of boys and excitement.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.333
All in your own class.

22:00.708 --> 22:02.000
[sobbing]

22:03.166 --> 22:05.791
[Mrs. Van Hopper] Did you
really think people wouldn't talk?

22:07.041 --> 22:11.333
Oh, you're best out of it. Everyone knows
he nearly lost his mind after she died.

22:11.416 --> 22:14.083
It was all too sudden and tragic.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.291
[crying]

22:15.375 --> 22:18.208
[Mrs. Van Hopper] Do you
honestly think he is in love with you?

22:19.916 --> 22:22.166
It was a distraction, dear. That's it.

22:23.666 --> 22:26.208
We'll go away. We'll go to New York.

22:27.208 --> 22:28.458
You'll find your way.

22:29.625 --> 22:31.000
You'll forget all about it.

22:32.291 --> 22:35.291
Trust me, you will forget all about it.

22:36.625 --> 22:37.458
[sniffling]

22:43.750 --> 22:45.041
[knocking at door]

22:45.125 --> 22:46.250
[Maxim] Just a moment.

22:46.333 --> 22:48.041
[Mademoiselle breathing heavily]

22:50.125 --> 22:52.875
Mrs. Van Hopper is leaving
and I have to go, too.

22:52.958 --> 22:54.916
-[Maxim] What are you talking about?
-Now. Today.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.166
I just wanted to say goodbye.

22:57.791 --> 22:59.083
Why haven't you told me before?

22:59.166 --> 23:01.083
Because she only decided it last night.

23:01.833 --> 23:05.041
And we're going to Paris with...
to meet her nephew.

23:05.125 --> 23:07.125
Then we go to Cherbourg
to sail to New York.

23:07.208 --> 23:11.166
All right. Listen, you mustn't cry.
Just give me a moment to think.

23:11.250 --> 23:12.166
I...

23:13.541 --> 23:16.791
I can't stay long.
She's expecting me downstairs.

23:20.708 --> 23:21.708
Come with me.

23:22.791 --> 23:23.791
What?

23:24.416 --> 23:25.416
To Manderley.

23:27.875 --> 23:30.875
What? As your secretary?

23:30.958 --> 23:32.833
No. No.

23:34.125 --> 23:35.375
As my wife.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.583
I'm asking you
to marry me, you little fool.

23:41.916 --> 23:43.541
I can't come to Manderley.

23:43.625 --> 23:46.791
Yes, you can.
You said you wanted to see the world.

23:46.875 --> 23:48.958
Manderley is the best part of it.

23:49.958 --> 23:52.916
Of course she's down there.
Where else is she?

23:53.000 --> 23:55.750
I've got to leave
in 20 minutes to catch the train.

23:56.500 --> 23:57.875
-I'll tell her.
-Do we have to go?

23:57.958 --> 24:00.250
Yes, we do.
I'm actually looking forward to this.

24:00.333 --> 24:01.958
That's exactly what I'm waiting for.

24:03.291 --> 24:04.333
Now, don't worry.

24:04.875 --> 24:06.833
-[knocking at door]
-[scoffs]

24:06.916 --> 24:08.041
Who is this now?

24:18.458 --> 24:22.208
[laughing] This is the most wonderful news
I've ever heard in my life!

24:22.291 --> 24:24.083
Wait till I tell my friends,
I can't believe it!

24:24.166 --> 24:26.291
What are the plans?
I must know everything.

24:26.375 --> 24:27.291
The plans are settled.

24:27.375 --> 24:29.291
We'll marry here,
and honeymoon in Europe.

24:29.375 --> 24:31.375
And then home to Manderley.

24:31.458 --> 24:34.875
Oh, my goodness. Have you ever heard
of anything more romantic?

24:34.958 --> 24:36.208
-"Home to Manderley."
-Mmm.

24:36.291 --> 24:38.333
[chuckling] Oh, my goodness.
It's out of a fairy tale.

24:39.625 --> 24:43.875
All right. I'll go and make sure
your bags don't end up on the train.

24:43.958 --> 24:46.375
-[Mrs. Van Hopper] Ah! Do hurry.
-You'll be fine.

24:46.458 --> 24:50.166
[Mrs. Van Hopper chuckling] Yes, go along.
We have lots to talk about.

24:51.833 --> 24:52.666
[door closes]

24:52.750 --> 24:56.291
Well, goodness gracious,
don't you work quickly?

24:57.625 --> 24:59.708
Have you been doing things you shouldn't?

25:00.541 --> 25:02.875
-I don't know what you mean.
-[chuckles]

25:04.791 --> 25:07.500
Well, you don't have a family,
luckily, to explain it to.

25:08.208 --> 25:10.083
I wash my hands of it.

25:10.166 --> 25:12.833
Gonna have your work cut out for you
at Manderley.

25:12.916 --> 25:14.875
And, frankly,
I don't think you're up to it.

25:14.958 --> 25:17.625
-I can learn.
-Let me tell you something, honey.

25:20.083 --> 25:24.416
When you trap a man between your legs,
they don't stick around for long.

25:28.375 --> 25:30.083
Goodbye, Mrs. Van Hopper.

25:30.166 --> 25:33.250
He's only marrying you
because he doesn't want to go on living

25:33.333 --> 25:36.416
in that big old house with her ghost!

25:36.500 --> 25:37.833
I don't believe in ghosts.

25:41.458 --> 25:42.375
[inhales sharply]

25:52.500 --> 25:54.750
[expectant music playing]

25:59.333 --> 26:03.833

26:03.916 --> 26:07.875

26:40.875 --> 26:43.875
[Maxim] Oh, God.
I hate it when they do this.

26:49.750 --> 26:51.750
So much for keeping things quiet.

26:53.208 --> 26:55.166
You know how she is, sir.

26:55.250 --> 26:58.041
There's a way
things are done at Manderley.

26:59.375 --> 27:00.583
[Maxim] Darling, this is Frith.

27:01.041 --> 27:03.083
-[Mrs. de Winter] Hello.
-[Frith grunts]

27:09.333 --> 27:12.000
[Maxim] Let's do things
properly, shall we? There we go.

27:12.708 --> 27:14.708
-What are you doing?
-What? You don't like that?

27:14.791 --> 27:16.625
-Up you go.
-[Mrs. de Winter shrieks]

27:19.791 --> 27:21.666
[indistinct chatter]

27:26.666 --> 27:27.875
[thunder rumbling]

27:35.291 --> 27:37.208
[Mrs. de Winter] Max, put me down.

27:42.625 --> 27:43.458
[kissing]

27:44.416 --> 27:45.750
[Mrs. de Winter clears throat] Oh.

27:48.583 --> 27:49.666
Mrs. Danvers.

27:50.791 --> 27:52.208
Welcome to Manderley.

27:53.333 --> 27:55.333
Hello. It's a pleasure. Oh!

28:02.916 --> 28:05.458
-Thank you. Thank you.
-[Mrs. Danvers] Tea is ready.

28:08.083 --> 28:12.000
[Maxim] Danvers runs the house. Don't
worry, she's not as scary as she seems.

28:14.500 --> 28:16.375
[Mrs. de Winter]
Oh, Maxim, it's wonderful!

28:17.125 --> 28:18.375
[barking]

28:18.458 --> 28:19.541
Stop that.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.583
There he is. The wanderer returns.
Good to see you, Max.

28:24.666 --> 28:26.625
-And you, Frank.
-How was the trip?

28:27.250 --> 28:30.791
Was rather eventful, as it turns out.

28:30.875 --> 28:33.166
-Frank Crawley, Mrs. de Winter.
-It's a pleasure.

28:33.250 --> 28:34.500
Thank you. Hello.

28:34.583 --> 28:36.291
[Maxim] Frank's the estate manager.

28:36.375 --> 28:37.916
The place would fall apart without him.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.250
Ah, no, no. He exaggerates.
Ignore him. [chuckles softly]

28:42.083 --> 28:45.500
I hate to be a bore,
but I urgently need a few signatures.

28:46.083 --> 28:48.083
I'll have him back to you in a jiffy.

28:49.041 --> 28:50.500
-Shall we?
-Yes.

28:52.750 --> 28:53.916
Oh, uh...

28:54.000 --> 28:57.625
Danvers, show Mrs. de Winter the house.
Can you?

28:57.708 --> 28:59.375
Oh, that's all right. I'll wait.

28:59.458 --> 29:02.708
No, don't be silly.
Go on. I'll catch you up.

29:07.166 --> 29:08.000
[sighs]

29:11.666 --> 29:14.958
[Mrs. Danvers] The estate has been
in the family for over 300 years.

29:15.875 --> 29:17.875
It was originally a gift from Henry VIII.

29:20.291 --> 29:21.541
[Mrs. de Winter] Extraordinary.

29:25.083 --> 29:27.583
[Mrs. Danvers] If there are guests,
you may use the drawing room.

29:27.666 --> 29:30.583
Don't forget to tell Frith
to light the fires,

29:30.666 --> 29:35.375
but generally, Mr. de Winter prefers
to take his coffee here in the library.

29:36.666 --> 29:41.041
Glad you're here, Mrs. Danvers.
I'll never remember all this.

29:45.791 --> 29:49.500
Oh, I'm sure you won't disappoint him,
madam, if that's your concern.

29:50.583 --> 29:52.916
The de Winter family
dates back to the Tudors.

29:53.500 --> 29:55.666
[Mrs. de Winter] And, um, who's that?

29:56.375 --> 29:59.791
[chuckles] That's Caroline de Winter.
Mr. de Winter's great aunt.

29:59.875 --> 30:01.333
[Mrs. de Winter] She's very striking.

30:01.416 --> 30:05.666
Yes, and one of the first women
to qualify as a doctor in England.

30:07.291 --> 30:08.875
It's one of his favorites.

30:09.708 --> 30:11.333
[Mrs. de Winter]
Where does everyone sleep?

30:11.916 --> 30:16.041
Maids in the attic, men below stairs,
as in your other houses, I presume.

30:17.791 --> 30:20.083
Never even seen a house like this.

30:22.416 --> 30:25.083
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you'd been a lady's maid.

30:26.208 --> 30:28.583
The master bedroom
is now in the east wing.

30:42.208 --> 30:43.041
[clears throat]

30:44.208 --> 30:47.291
What a... pretty pattern.

30:49.083 --> 30:53.291
This is Clarice. She'll look after you
until your maid gets here.

30:53.916 --> 30:57.333
I don't have a maid,
but I'm sure I'll manage without one.

30:58.583 --> 31:00.708
Well, I think you'll find you need one.

31:01.875 --> 31:04.500
Perhaps Clarice could take the position.

31:06.375 --> 31:09.500
Oh! You can't see the sea from here.

31:09.583 --> 31:10.958
No, you can't.

31:12.250 --> 31:14.166
Should Mr. de Winter
ask for his old wardrobe,

31:14.250 --> 31:16.500
I'm afraid you must tell him
it wouldn't fit here.

31:16.583 --> 31:18.583
The rooms in this wing are much smaller.

31:19.583 --> 31:21.416
This wasn't his bedroom before?

31:21.500 --> 31:26.083
Oh, no. No. Mrs. de Winter's rooms
were in the west wing.

31:30.125 --> 31:33.458
Well, it's a lovely room.
Much too nice to stand empty.

31:34.125 --> 31:36.500
The guest rooms
are never empty for very long.

31:39.250 --> 31:42.625
We entertained a lot
when the late Mrs. de Winter was alive.

31:43.500 --> 31:45.500
The Manderley ball was quite an event.

31:47.541 --> 31:49.208
I'll leave you with Clarice.

31:57.833 --> 31:59.500
[Mrs. de Winter] Ask me a question.

32:01.708 --> 32:03.041
[Maxim] What sort of question?

32:04.458 --> 32:06.166
[Mrs. de Winter sighs] Anything.

32:08.166 --> 32:10.041
I have no secrets from you.

32:11.375 --> 32:14.708
Don't you think that's how it should be
now that we're married?

32:15.500 --> 32:17.916
[Maxim] All marriages have their secrets.

32:22.041 --> 32:26.333
You can talk to me about her...
if you want.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.208
Good night, darling.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.166
-[Mrs. de Winter grunts]
-[faint clattering]

33:24.458 --> 33:25.666
[wind whistling]

33:28.458 --> 33:29.416
[grunts]

33:29.500 --> 33:30.541
[breathing rapidly]

33:36.750 --> 33:38.750
[footsteps falling]

33:46.875 --> 33:48.125
[Mrs. de Winter] Maxim?

34:28.416 --> 34:29.958
-[Mrs. Danvers] Leave him.
-[yelps]

34:31.125 --> 34:33.125
It's dangerous to wake a sleepwalker.

35:49.750 --> 35:53.458
And nothing to worry about,
but the stables will need reroofing

35:53.541 --> 35:55.500
because the tiles are spoiled...

35:55.583 --> 35:56.791
[Maxim] Hmm.

35:56.875 --> 35:58.833
-Good morning, darling.
-Good morning.

35:58.916 --> 36:00.708
-[Maxim] Sleep well?
-Yes, not bad.

36:03.500 --> 36:04.500
Come.

36:05.916 --> 36:08.833
-How are you settling in?
-Very well, thank you.

36:08.916 --> 36:10.041
Good. Good.

36:11.291 --> 36:14.583
I'll... [clears throat]
see you up there, shall I?

36:14.666 --> 36:16.583
-Won't be a sec.
-Mrs. de Winter.

36:16.666 --> 36:17.541
Oh, Mr. Crawley.

36:19.166 --> 36:21.000
Frank. It's Frank.

36:24.375 --> 36:25.500
I should have got up earlier.

36:25.583 --> 36:28.500
-We could have had breakfast together.
-Oh, that's all right.

36:30.791 --> 36:32.500
Did you know you sleepwalk?

36:37.208 --> 36:38.708
Enjoy your breakfast.

36:56.250 --> 36:57.375
[servants giggling]

36:59.041 --> 37:00.500
[dog barking]

37:01.708 --> 37:04.041
-[Mrs. de Winter] Jasper!
-[barking]

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
Where are you going? Jasper!

37:17.291 --> 37:19.083
[whispers] Jasper, where have you gone?

38:15.208 --> 38:16.416
-[shatters]
-[gasps]

38:18.625 --> 38:20.375
[dog growls softly]

38:24.833 --> 38:26.000
[exclaims] Ow!

38:52.333 --> 38:54.333
[indistinct chatter]

38:58.000 --> 39:00.125
I'm sorry to disturb you all...

39:00.791 --> 39:02.916
Clarice, have you seen Mr. de Winter?

39:03.000 --> 39:05.458
Do you have a plaster?
I've cut my hand.

39:05.541 --> 39:06.583
[Clarice] Let me see.

39:06.666 --> 39:09.500
-Really, it's nothing. I'm fine.
-Oh, my. One moment.

39:10.916 --> 39:14.916
Since you're here, madam, may I have
your approval for today's menus?

39:15.000 --> 39:16.083
[clears throat] Oh.

39:17.166 --> 39:20.750
Yes. Good.
Very suitable. Very nice indeed.

39:20.833 --> 39:23.916
-And the sauce for the roast veal?
-Yes, that looks excellent.

39:24.500 --> 39:26.541
No, but I've left it blank, you see?

39:27.708 --> 39:30.750
Mrs. de Winter was
most particular about her sauces.

39:33.000 --> 39:33.958
Right. Well, um...

39:34.958 --> 39:35.791
Uh...

39:36.791 --> 39:39.333
We'll have whatever Mrs. de Winter
would have had.

39:39.416 --> 39:40.291
Very well, madam.

39:43.416 --> 39:45.166
-There we go.
-Thank you very much.

40:18.583 --> 40:19.416
[door opens]

40:19.500 --> 40:21.541
[Maxim] Is everything all right, darling?

40:21.625 --> 40:26.583
I was thinking of... ordering some
new undergarments from London.

40:27.958 --> 40:30.916
Something lacy and a nightgown.

40:33.291 --> 40:36.375
When have I ever complained
about what you wear?

40:45.708 --> 40:48.041
[Mrs. de Winter] This is nice, isn't it?
Just us.

40:48.125 --> 40:50.750
It's almost like
we're back on our honeymoon.

40:52.083 --> 40:57.291
Oh, I miss it. Don't you?
Driving, the exploring, little cafes?

40:58.083 --> 41:01.041
[sighs] Seeing some funny old hotel
and just staying there.

41:02.166 --> 41:04.125
[Maxim] That's not real life, darling.

41:04.958 --> 41:05.791
[barking]

41:05.875 --> 41:08.083
-[shouts] Jasper! Jasper!
-I'll get him.

41:08.166 --> 41:10.958
[Maxim] No, just leave him.
He'll find his own way back.

41:11.041 --> 41:12.791
It's so steep. What if he falls?

41:12.875 --> 41:14.166
I said leave him!

41:17.583 --> 41:18.833
[Mrs. de Winter] Jasper!

41:20.541 --> 41:21.583
Jasper!

41:23.666 --> 41:24.875
Jasper, come here!

41:30.750 --> 41:31.583
Jasper!

41:31.666 --> 41:32.500
[barks]

41:40.750 --> 41:41.708
Jasper!

41:44.791 --> 41:46.333
Jasper, come out of there.

41:50.458 --> 41:51.708
[door creaks]

42:10.625 --> 42:12.125
[Jasper growling faintly]

42:14.000 --> 42:15.166
Jasper, come here.

42:15.250 --> 42:16.083
[growls]

42:16.875 --> 42:19.291
All right, get something to tie you with.

42:32.625 --> 42:33.458
[growls]

42:37.000 --> 42:38.958
[barks]

42:44.750 --> 42:46.041
Hello?

42:58.333 --> 43:00.583
-There's nothing here, silly. Hey!
-[barks]

43:17.958 --> 43:18.791
I'm...

43:18.875 --> 43:21.708
I didn't realize that anyone lived here.

43:21.791 --> 43:24.791
No, I don't, do I?
Live up in the keeper's cottage.

43:25.583 --> 43:27.750
I've been digging
for shells since forenoon.

43:28.333 --> 43:30.458
Oh, you've been digging for shells? Huh?

43:31.291 --> 43:32.125
Um...

43:32.625 --> 43:34.041
No. I just, I...

43:35.250 --> 43:38.541
I needed something to tie my dog with.
I'll be out of your way.

43:38.625 --> 43:40.541
-He ain't yourn.
-Oh, no.

43:41.166 --> 43:43.166
-He's Mr. de Winter's dog.
-No.

43:43.250 --> 43:44.875
That's her dog.

43:46.791 --> 43:48.833
She don't come here no more.

43:49.500 --> 43:53.458
She... she gone into the sea, ain't she?

43:55.083 --> 43:56.416
She drowned.

43:59.750 --> 44:01.250
You ain't like her.

44:05.416 --> 44:07.875
Yes. Come on, Jasper.

44:08.958 --> 44:11.208
I never said nothin', did I?

44:12.500 --> 44:14.125
Come on, Jasper. Come on.

44:26.500 --> 44:29.125
I know why you didn't want
to come down here.

44:31.708 --> 44:33.041
How am I supposed to know?

44:33.708 --> 44:36.166
How am I supposed to know anything
if you don't tell me?

44:36.250 --> 44:38.791
-[Maxim] That's supposed to be locked.
-Someone was in there.

44:39.875 --> 44:43.041
[Maxim] Probably just the keeper's son,
Ben. He's harmless enough.

44:43.125 --> 44:44.291
[Mrs. de Winter] Maxim, I...

45:03.708 --> 45:05.208
[thunder rumbling]

45:05.291 --> 45:06.541
[indistinct laughter]

45:08.166 --> 45:09.875
[Beatrice] Oh, God!

45:12.958 --> 45:15.208
-[Mrs. de Winter] That's in Italy.
-[Beatrice] There he is.

45:15.291 --> 45:17.875
[Mrs. de Winter] Oh, yes.
That was just after the wedding.

45:20.208 --> 45:21.708
What a nice plain frock.

45:23.166 --> 45:26.375
Look, Max was right.
You're not at all what I expected.

45:27.041 --> 45:29.500
And you're looking better, old man.

45:29.583 --> 45:30.708
Not so drawn.

45:30.791 --> 45:32.458
-Please.
-Bosh!

45:32.541 --> 45:35.750
Everyone knows you were
a perfect wreck six months ago.

45:37.041 --> 45:39.541
Here, Granny, have you seen these?

45:39.625 --> 45:41.666
-Look, aren't they lovely?
-[Granny] Ah.

45:41.750 --> 45:43.458
[Beatrice] Goodness! Yes.

45:43.541 --> 45:45.666
[Mrs. de Winter] So,
these were from our wedding.

45:46.250 --> 45:48.958
[Beatrice] What's all this
I hear about you not hunting?

45:49.708 --> 45:51.333
Oh, no, I'm afraid I don't ride.

45:51.416 --> 45:54.625
Oh, but you must!
Or you'll miss out on all the fun.

45:54.708 --> 45:56.166
Come and stay. I can teach you.

45:56.250 --> 45:58.041
Finest horsewoman in the county.

45:58.125 --> 45:59.708
Do dry up, Giles.

45:59.791 --> 46:03.416
It might shock my sister
that not everyone shares her idea of fun.

46:03.500 --> 46:07.125
Whatever her idea of fun,
she certainly deserves to have some.

46:07.208 --> 46:11.375
Well, actually, I've been
thinking I might revive the ball.

46:14.166 --> 46:15.500
-[Giles] Huh.
-Oh!

46:16.333 --> 46:18.666
Hmm, what a marvelous idea.

46:19.416 --> 46:21.291
That's not something we discussed.

46:21.875 --> 46:24.333
[Beatrice] Oh,
don't be so damn miserable.

46:24.916 --> 46:26.333
You used to love it.

46:26.916 --> 46:29.458
You can hold it
in honor of your new bride.

46:33.541 --> 46:34.500
Fine.

46:36.000 --> 46:37.875
Well, that's settled, then.

46:37.958 --> 46:40.708
-To our new hostess.
-Yeah. To our new hostess.

46:42.208 --> 46:45.000
Are you staying at Manderley, dear?

46:45.416 --> 46:46.416
[Beatrice] She lives here.

46:46.500 --> 46:49.166
-[Giles] Remember, Granny?
-[Beatrice] Granny, we introduced you.

46:49.250 --> 46:51.166
She's Maxim's wife.

46:52.958 --> 46:54.666
[chuckling] No, she is not.

46:56.708 --> 46:57.541
[chuckling]

47:02.000 --> 47:05.333
[chuckling] She's not Maxim's wife.

47:06.875 --> 47:10.041
[chuckling] What a silly notion.

47:10.125 --> 47:15.250
Uh, well, it's...
good news about the ball, uh...

47:15.875 --> 47:17.541
It's been far too long.

47:17.625 --> 47:19.583
I don't remember you.

47:20.250 --> 47:21.958
Oh, no, I...

47:22.625 --> 47:24.916
[loudly] We haven't met before.

47:26.125 --> 47:29.625
-Maxim, who is this child?
-Ow!

47:29.708 --> 47:32.500
-[Giles] Oh, Christ.
-[Maxim] All right, let's get Granny home.

47:32.583 --> 47:34.750
[Granny] What have
you done with Rebecca?

47:34.833 --> 47:36.541
-[Beatrice] Leave it.
-No, I've got it!

47:36.625 --> 47:38.416
[Granny] I want to see Rebecca.
Leave me alone!

47:38.500 --> 47:42.166
[Giles] She just gets a little...
it's the time of day, and the weather...

47:44.333 --> 47:47.041
-[Beatrice] Oh, my! Get her in the car.
-[Granny] I just want to...

47:47.125 --> 47:48.666
[Giles] You go and talk to her.

47:48.750 --> 47:50.750
Let's get in the car, Granny. Come on.

47:50.833 --> 47:53.958
[Clarice] This is from the flower room.
I hope that's all right.

47:54.041 --> 47:55.708
-[Mrs. de Winter] Thank you.
-I apologize.

47:55.791 --> 47:59.166
I'd forgotten how fond
our grandmother was of Rebecca.

47:59.250 --> 48:00.333
I'm fine.

48:00.416 --> 48:03.708
She was just
one of those bloody annoying people.

48:03.791 --> 48:09.666
Irresistible to everybody. The men, women,
children, animals. [chuckles]

48:09.750 --> 48:12.583
Us mere mortals couldn't hope to compete.

48:22.375 --> 48:23.375
[engine starts]

48:28.791 --> 48:30.041
[thunder rumbling]

48:44.458 --> 48:46.375
-[Frith] Sir.
-[Maxim] Why is he crying?

48:46.458 --> 48:49.666
[Frith] Sir, one of the porcelain pieces
is missing from the morning room,

48:49.750 --> 48:52.083
and now Danvers
is calling for the boy's dismissal.

48:52.166 --> 48:53.416
-But it wasn't--
-Which piece?

48:53.500 --> 48:54.541
We're not sure, sir.

48:55.416 --> 48:56.416
Danvers!

48:57.333 --> 49:00.000
-Is everything all right?
-[Maxim] Yes, it's fine.

49:00.083 --> 49:02.708
Something's just gone missing
from the morning room.

49:02.791 --> 49:05.833
-Danvers!
-What is it? What's gone missing?

49:08.416 --> 49:10.541
What makes you think Robert took it?

49:11.500 --> 49:13.583
The Dresden is extremely valuable, sir.

49:13.666 --> 49:15.958
-But it wasn't me!
-[Mrs. Danvers] That piece is worth £100.

49:16.041 --> 49:18.875
-[Frith] Sir, I find it most unlikely--
-[Mrs. Danvers] Then who, Frith?

49:19.666 --> 49:23.000
The between maid isn't allowed
in the morning room. I do it.

49:23.625 --> 49:25.750
When Mrs. de Winter
was alive, we did it together.

49:25.833 --> 49:27.833
-[Maxim] All Frith is saying--
-It was me.

49:32.041 --> 49:34.916
I broke it. It broke.

49:36.250 --> 49:38.083
It was an accident. It fell.

49:41.708 --> 49:43.958
Well, there we go.

49:44.541 --> 49:46.208
Robert, you're off the hook.

49:47.333 --> 49:48.416
[sniffles]

49:51.333 --> 49:53.041
Where are the pieces, madam?

49:54.625 --> 49:56.958
In the bureau drawer at the back.

49:57.833 --> 49:59.916
Send them to London.
See if anything can be done.

50:00.000 --> 50:01.166
[Mrs. Danvers] Certainly, sir.

50:01.250 --> 50:04.625
And may I suggest,
should anything like this happen again,

50:04.708 --> 50:06.500
that Mrs. de Winter tell me herself.

50:08.125 --> 50:09.708
[Maxim] If we're all quite finished?

50:44.000 --> 50:44.833
[sobs]

50:49.750 --> 50:50.958
[exclaims angrily]

51:22.458 --> 51:23.791
[dog barking]

51:41.583 --> 51:42.708
[grunts]

52:01.875 --> 52:03.375
[footsteps approaching]

52:06.375 --> 52:07.375
Oh, Frank.

52:08.166 --> 52:09.166
Mrs. de Winter.

52:10.500 --> 52:12.625
I thought you'd
gone up to London with Max.

52:13.291 --> 52:14.416
He's in London?

52:15.000 --> 52:17.833
Yeah. Taking care of some paperwork.

52:18.875 --> 52:21.458
He asked me to put a padlock on.
I nearly locked you in.

52:23.125 --> 52:24.166
It's a shame.

52:26.000 --> 52:27.500
This place going to ruin.

52:28.791 --> 52:32.458
Well... no boat now.

52:35.083 --> 52:36.583
Max doesn't like to sail.

52:53.125 --> 52:54.416
Ben said she drowned.

52:56.250 --> 52:59.166
I'm sorry. I assumed you knew.

53:00.416 --> 53:02.333
-No.
-Ah, it's...

53:03.083 --> 53:04.416
It was brutal weather.

53:05.625 --> 53:08.125
Even for her. She was an excellent sailor.

53:08.833 --> 53:10.083
The boat went down.

53:11.583 --> 53:13.000
They never recovered it.

53:14.083 --> 53:17.833
She washed up
in Edgcumbe some... two months later.

53:18.541 --> 53:21.416
Two months? My God!

53:22.791 --> 53:23.791
Poor Maxim.

53:24.583 --> 53:27.916
Drove him down there myself
to identify the body.

53:30.166 --> 53:33.375
You know, you really
mustn't dwell on the past.

53:33.458 --> 53:35.958
You're so good for Max.
He's a changed man.

53:37.916 --> 53:39.666
She must have been so afraid.

53:41.375 --> 53:42.666
Out there alone.

53:43.875 --> 53:45.666
She wasn't afraid of anything.

53:53.166 --> 53:57.083
Can I ask you something, Frank?
And promise to tell me the truth.

53:57.166 --> 54:00.750
[chuckles] Hardly fair.
Don't know what you're gonna ask me.

54:02.250 --> 54:04.166
Was Rebecca very beautiful?

54:08.375 --> 54:09.375
Yes.

54:12.500 --> 54:14.083
Yes, I suppose she was...

54:15.291 --> 54:18.416
the most beautiful
creature I ever saw in my life.

54:29.666 --> 54:31.666
[dramatic music playing]

54:58.500 --> 55:00.375
-[perfume spritzes]
-[inhales]

55:14.125 --> 55:16.166
-[Mrs. Danvers] It is beautiful, isn't it?
-[gasps]

55:18.041 --> 55:19.833
I keep it just the way it was.

55:21.083 --> 55:23.625
It's as if she'd just
gone out for a while.

55:24.666 --> 55:26.041
You startled me.

55:27.958 --> 55:29.541
This was her favorite.

55:32.375 --> 55:34.458
I laid it out for her that night.

55:42.583 --> 55:44.041
Go on, hold it.

55:45.625 --> 55:46.541
Touch it.

55:51.875 --> 55:56.583
She wouldn't have a lady's maid, you know.
"I don't want anyone but you, Danny."

55:58.833 --> 56:00.666
Do you see how tall she was?

56:04.958 --> 56:08.458
Hmm. She could wear
anything with a figure like hers.

56:11.083 --> 56:14.875
I'd brush her hair for her every evening.

56:18.250 --> 56:20.625
"Come on, Danny, hair drill," she'd say.

56:22.125 --> 56:23.750
I'd stand behind her...

56:24.875 --> 56:28.291
and brush away for 20 minutes at a time.

56:29.708 --> 56:32.916
That great mass of dark hair.

56:37.500 --> 56:38.750
He joined in.

56:40.666 --> 56:42.541
He loved to do that for her.

56:44.250 --> 56:47.583
They'd be dressing for dinner,
guests waiting downstairs.

56:47.666 --> 56:50.500
"Harder, Max, harder!" [laughs]

56:50.583 --> 56:52.833
And he'd roar with laughter.

56:54.833 --> 56:56.791
He was always laughing back then.

57:02.750 --> 57:04.250
Does he brush your hair?

57:05.791 --> 57:06.791
No.

57:09.625 --> 57:14.791
Mrs. Danvers, does Mr. de Winter
ask you to keep the room like this?

57:14.875 --> 57:16.291
He doesn't have to.

57:17.375 --> 57:18.750
She's still here.

57:20.750 --> 57:21.833
Can you feel her?

57:24.125 --> 57:26.833
I wonder what she's thinking about you.

57:27.333 --> 57:31.416
Taking her husband and... using her name.

57:34.458 --> 57:36.750
-I'm sure she'd want him to be happy.
-Happy?

57:36.833 --> 57:38.541
No, he'll never be happy.

57:41.750 --> 57:43.541
She was the love of his life.

58:03.583 --> 58:05.916
-[footsteps falling]
-[muttering]

58:07.250 --> 58:08.250
[gasping]

58:15.250 --> 58:16.166
[Mrs. de Winter] Maxim?

58:17.458 --> 58:19.708
-[vines rustling]
-[Mrs. de Winter yelps]

58:30.625 --> 58:31.458
[grunts]

58:32.250 --> 58:33.958
Good morning, madam.

58:34.666 --> 58:38.333
-[breathing heavily]
-Oh, dear! You've been scratchin'.

58:39.000 --> 58:39.833
[whimpers]

58:47.958 --> 58:49.000
[exhales heavily]

59:02.458 --> 59:04.041
[dogs barking]

59:15.916 --> 59:17.750
[Favell] Have we missed ya?

59:22.333 --> 59:25.541
Hello! You must be the new Mrs. de Winter.

59:26.125 --> 59:27.916
Uh, I think there's been a mistake.

59:28.500 --> 59:31.291
-Mr. de Winter's in London.
-He's left you on your own?

59:32.041 --> 59:34.541
Isn't he afraid some bounder
might come and carry you off?

59:35.125 --> 59:37.458
I'm Jack Favell. How do you do?

59:39.250 --> 59:40.291
[laughs nervously]

59:41.208 --> 59:42.041
Um...

59:42.833 --> 59:45.250
Well, did you want to leave your card?

59:46.208 --> 59:48.500
-And too polite to tell me to bugger off.
-[scoffs]

59:48.583 --> 59:50.000
You are a sweetheart.

59:50.083 --> 59:52.791
Not to worry.
I just popped by to see Danny.

59:52.875 --> 59:54.625
She's invited me for tea.

59:55.416 --> 59:58.583
-I'm horribly early, though.
-Mrs. Danvers?

59:59.166 --> 1:00:01.416
That's why I thought
I'd better hover around out here,

1:00:01.500 --> 1:00:03.791
otherwise I might
get a smack on the wrist.

1:00:05.125 --> 1:00:07.166
[horse neighing]

1:00:10.500 --> 1:00:13.416
Mr. Favell? Where are you going?

1:00:13.500 --> 1:00:15.708
-[horse neighing]
-[Favell] Charlie, come on.

1:00:15.791 --> 1:00:17.625
-Excuse me, Mr. Favell!
-[Charlie] Coming, sir.

1:00:17.708 --> 1:00:18.708
[horse neighing]

1:00:19.291 --> 1:00:20.958
Phillippa! Come on in, Charlie.

1:00:21.041 --> 1:00:23.833
-[Charlie] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stand down.
-[neighing]

1:00:23.916 --> 1:00:25.416
-[Favell] Easy, Starlight.
-Steady.

1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:28.916
[Favell chuckling] You've too much energy.
They've been neglecting you.

1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:30.041
That's not a surprise.

1:00:30.625 --> 1:00:33.583
Rebecca was the only one
who could handle you, wasn't she, old boy?

1:00:33.666 --> 1:00:34.500
Yes.

1:00:35.291 --> 1:00:36.458
You knew Rebecca?

1:00:38.500 --> 1:00:41.000
She's my cousin. Was.

1:00:43.583 --> 1:00:44.416
[Charlie] That's it.

1:00:45.125 --> 1:00:46.875
Let's take one of the horses
out for a turn.

1:00:46.958 --> 1:00:49.791
Oh, no. I really... I don't know how.

1:00:49.875 --> 1:00:53.833
Well, I can teach you.
Or have you something better to be doing?

1:00:54.541 --> 1:00:56.666
-How do I--
-On three, swing your leg over.

1:00:56.750 --> 1:00:58.125
-Ready?
-[Mrs. de Winter] Do you--

1:00:58.208 --> 1:00:59.541
[Favell] One, two, three.

1:01:00.375 --> 1:01:01.208
[grunts]

1:01:01.291 --> 1:01:04.375
-Can you give me a stirrup? All right.
-All right.

1:01:04.458 --> 1:01:05.541
[gasps] Are you...

1:01:07.708 --> 1:01:10.375
-We won't go too fast. [clicks tongue]
-[horse snorts]

1:01:15.666 --> 1:01:16.791
[Favell] That's it.

1:01:19.750 --> 1:01:20.875
How do you feel?

1:01:24.250 --> 1:01:27.000
-Right, now you take the reins.
-Oh, all right.

1:01:27.583 --> 1:01:29.166
-Be nice and loose.
-Yeah.

1:01:29.250 --> 1:01:31.791
And low. That's it.

1:01:31.875 --> 1:01:33.791
-Got it.
-Right here on your lap.

1:01:34.625 --> 1:01:37.625
Now, very important. Squeeze the thighs.

1:01:38.458 --> 1:01:41.083
-Let the beast know you're there.
-Mmm-hmm.

1:01:41.166 --> 1:01:43.500
You're gonna be
wickedly sore this evening.

1:01:44.041 --> 1:01:46.125
-Now just move with me. Ready?
-Mmm-hmm.

1:01:46.208 --> 1:01:47.208
All right. [clicks tongue]

1:01:47.291 --> 1:01:49.416
[Mrs. de Winter laughs]

1:01:50.541 --> 1:01:52.250
[Favell] Darling, may I ask you something?

1:01:52.916 --> 1:01:55.666
Has Max ever talked to you
about the accident?

1:01:58.458 --> 1:02:01.541
And he never mentioned
Rebecca's trip to London that day?

1:02:02.833 --> 1:02:03.833
No.

1:02:05.166 --> 1:02:07.083
No, he won't speak of it at all.

1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:14.666
So, you don't know if he saw her
when she got back that night,

1:02:16.041 --> 1:02:17.583
before she took the boat out?

1:02:18.708 --> 1:02:19.708
No.

1:02:20.708 --> 1:02:21.541
[Favell] Hmm.

1:02:25.875 --> 1:02:28.333
There's something she wanted to tell me.

1:02:29.250 --> 1:02:30.791
Something very important.

1:02:34.750 --> 1:02:36.750
And not knowing what it was...

1:02:37.541 --> 1:02:38.375
[sighs]

1:02:39.875 --> 1:02:41.791
That's really been a hard thing.

1:02:45.916 --> 1:02:48.583
I'm not doing
my roguish image any good, am I?

1:02:51.375 --> 1:02:53.458
You should come back and ask Maxim.

1:02:53.958 --> 1:02:54.916
Well, I would.

1:02:57.958 --> 1:03:00.250
But I'm afraid I'm a little bit banned
from visiting.

1:03:01.750 --> 1:03:05.166
In fact, it's best if you don't mention
my being here at all today.

1:03:05.250 --> 1:03:07.750
I... I thought you were friends.

1:03:08.666 --> 1:03:09.750
Not really, no.

1:03:13.625 --> 1:03:16.875
And I would hate for either one of us

1:03:17.666 --> 1:03:20.708
to be on the receiving end
of that famous temper of his.

1:03:20.791 --> 1:03:22.333
I don't know what you're talking about.

1:03:24.875 --> 1:03:27.000
Well, it is still early days.

1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:35.500
Well, I better not keep Danny waiting.
You know how she is.

1:03:43.583 --> 1:03:44.416
[sighs]

1:03:48.916 --> 1:03:50.666
[staff chatting and laughing]

1:04:06.416 --> 1:04:07.791
Why did you invite him?

1:04:10.041 --> 1:04:11.000
Jack Favell.

1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:13.458
You asked him for tea,

1:04:14.041 --> 1:04:17.625
knowing full well Mr. de Winter
has banned him from the property.

1:04:18.333 --> 1:04:20.375
There must be some mistake, madam.

1:04:21.041 --> 1:04:23.958
I haven't seen Mr. Favell for over a year.

1:04:55.708 --> 1:04:56.625
[Maxim] Hello, Frith.

1:04:56.708 --> 1:05:00.166
[Frith whispers] Hello, sir. Mr. Favell
has made an unannounced visit.

1:05:05.041 --> 1:05:07.000
[Mrs. de Winter] I don't care
what she told Frith!

1:05:07.083 --> 1:05:10.166
[shakily] Mr. Favell told me
that she invited him here.

1:05:10.250 --> 1:05:13.750
And I suppose Mrs. Danvers forced you
to go riding with him, did she?

1:05:13.833 --> 1:05:15.166
No, I can explain!

1:05:15.250 --> 1:05:18.000
-Explain what?
-I was going to tell you, I was.

1:05:18.083 --> 1:05:21.541
Want to tell me how you
dragged him down to the boathouse?

1:05:23.041 --> 1:05:26.166
Parade your
fancy new night clothes for him?

1:05:26.250 --> 1:05:27.916
[crying] How could you even think that?

1:05:28.500 --> 1:05:33.250
I'd never have let him on the property
if I'd known it would upset you, Maxim.

1:05:33.916 --> 1:05:36.625
Please. I love you.

1:05:40.625 --> 1:05:41.791
Oh, do you?

1:05:42.375 --> 1:05:44.166
Mrs. Danvers invited him here.

1:05:44.250 --> 1:05:47.208
[loudly] I don't wanna hear
another word about Danvers!

1:05:59.041 --> 1:06:00.333
[knocking at door]

1:06:11.750 --> 1:06:12.750
Come in.

1:06:16.541 --> 1:06:17.375
[door closes]

1:06:18.333 --> 1:06:19.375
Mrs. Danvers.

1:06:20.458 --> 1:06:22.083
I've come to give you your notice.

1:06:25.583 --> 1:06:27.875
Has Mr. de Winter agreed to this?

1:06:27.958 --> 1:06:29.333
The decision is mine.

1:06:35.708 --> 1:06:36.958
[Mrs. Danvers] You see...

1:06:38.500 --> 1:06:41.500
I looked after Rebecca
when she was a little girl.

1:06:42.333 --> 1:06:45.333
We came here together
when she was first married.

1:06:48.416 --> 1:06:49.750
I was her friend.

1:06:52.125 --> 1:06:54.083
Someone to share her secrets.

1:06:56.791 --> 1:06:58.583
Bond like that can't be broke.

1:06:59.333 --> 1:07:02.541
Can't be replaced.
I was wrong to expect that from you.

1:07:05.583 --> 1:07:09.166
Well, you'll find another house.

1:07:10.458 --> 1:07:11.458
[laughs dryly]

1:07:12.041 --> 1:07:13.083
No.

1:07:13.791 --> 1:07:19.458
We women, we can either marry
or go into service,

1:07:19.541 --> 1:07:21.958
and I'm too old for either.

1:07:23.625 --> 1:07:26.541
Well, we'll make sure
that you're provided for.

1:07:26.625 --> 1:07:28.375
Oh, it's not about money. It's...

1:07:29.041 --> 1:07:32.916
This wasn't a job for me.
Rebecca was my life.

1:07:36.541 --> 1:07:37.375
Yes.

1:07:38.083 --> 1:07:39.833
I'm sorry if I failed you.

1:07:39.916 --> 1:07:41.333
I didn't mean to let you down.

1:07:41.416 --> 1:07:44.916
It was just you seemed
so set on doing things your own way.

1:07:46.041 --> 1:07:48.083
No. This is all very new to me.

1:07:48.708 --> 1:07:50.458
The house, the staff...

1:07:51.500 --> 1:07:56.708
I just... I think that Mr. de Winter
hoped that you'd help me.

1:07:58.583 --> 1:08:00.416
You didn't ask for my help.

1:08:07.083 --> 1:08:08.083
Well...

1:08:10.750 --> 1:08:12.375
what if I asked for it now?

1:08:47.625 --> 1:08:48.916
I'm sorry.

1:08:50.458 --> 1:08:53.833
I was an idiot. It's not your fault.

1:08:56.125 --> 1:08:57.416
I know it wasn't.

1:09:08.416 --> 1:09:09.791
[Maxim] I'm so sorry.

1:09:27.750 --> 1:09:28.583
Okay.

1:09:33.541 --> 1:09:37.541
Very good, madam. Perfect.
I'll have them printed at once.

1:09:37.625 --> 1:09:40.375
Oh, and we must let
Voce in London know before Friday

1:09:40.458 --> 1:09:42.125
if you wish them to make your costume.

1:09:42.208 --> 1:09:45.708
[Mrs. de Winter] Yes. I'm afraid
I'm drawing a bit of a blank there.

1:09:45.791 --> 1:09:46.750
[Mrs. Danvers] Oh.

1:09:47.750 --> 1:09:51.791
Well, you'll be
the most important lady at the ball.

1:09:51.875 --> 1:09:55.375
-So, choose something with that in mind.
-Yes.

1:09:56.541 --> 1:09:57.916
Oh, be confident.

1:09:58.833 --> 1:10:01.125
Let them see your natural beauty.

1:10:04.416 --> 1:10:05.791
[Clarice] Madam?

1:10:06.500 --> 1:10:08.791
If it's not too forward of me...

1:10:09.833 --> 1:10:13.666
Mrs. Danvers said you'd
not picked out what to wear yet, and...

1:10:14.916 --> 1:10:16.916
I wondered if you'd want an idea.

1:10:18.041 --> 1:10:21.291
Yes, please, anything. Sit down.

1:10:21.375 --> 1:10:22.208
Um...

1:10:23.458 --> 1:10:26.833
Just... the old paintings in the gallery.

1:10:27.666 --> 1:10:30.750
I always thought they'd make
the most beautiful costume.

1:10:31.458 --> 1:10:34.041
Especially the lady in the red dress.

[indistinct chatter]

1:11:23.791 --> 1:11:26.125
Right. Will you take
this down to Mrs. Danvers?

1:11:26.208 --> 1:11:27.708
-Make sure she has everything.
-Right.

1:11:27.791 --> 1:11:30.125
-Thank you very much.
-And if you go through to the house.

1:11:30.208 --> 1:11:31.291
-Oh, sorry.
-I'm sorry!

1:11:31.375 --> 1:11:33.375
-Welcome.
-[Frank] Are you quite all right?

1:11:33.458 --> 1:11:36.041
-Yes. There's bit of a wind, Frank.
-Well, yes.

1:11:36.125 --> 1:11:38.333
-Hope it doesn't rain.
-It'll come to nothing, I'm sure.

No, you'll ruin the surprise.

1:12:04.166 --> 1:12:05.916
You know I don't like surprises.

1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:09.041
Well, you'll like this one.

1:12:09.958 --> 1:12:11.333

1:12:15.583 --> 1:12:16.791
I'm so proud of you.

Now, don't you leave me
down there too long.

1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:19.833
Oh, Maxim.

1:27:21.125 --> 1:27:22.291
You didn't know her.

1:27:23.541 --> 1:27:24.791
Nobody did.

1:27:28.041 --> 1:27:30.208
She told me on our honeymoon
how it would be.

1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:32.875
How she would keep her flat in London.

1:27:33.708 --> 1:27:36.958
Her parade of men. Even her own cousin.

1:27:37.916 --> 1:27:38.916
Please, Maxim!

1:27:40.458 --> 1:27:43.500
She relished it. Playing the part.

1:27:44.208 --> 1:27:48.125
The perfect wife,
knowing that I would never divorce her.

1:27:48.208 --> 1:27:49.791
'Cause you loved her.

1:27:52.833 --> 1:27:55.291
I hated her.

1:27:58.041 --> 1:27:59.333
Hated her cruelty.

1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:02.750
I hated my cowardice.

1:28:04.375 --> 1:28:09.041
Knowing that I wouldn't divorce her.
Knowing I could never do that to our name.

1:28:16.666 --> 1:28:17.750
How did she die?

1:28:18.458 --> 1:28:19.833
When she came back from London,

1:28:19.916 --> 1:28:22.458
she told me
she was expecting a visit from Favell.

1:28:23.541 --> 1:28:25.416
When I got here, she was alone.

1:28:25.500 --> 1:28:27.208
She looked different. She was pale.

1:28:28.458 --> 1:28:30.416
She'd seen a doctor in London.

1:28:30.500 --> 1:28:36.041
She said, "Imagine if I had a child, Max.
You could never prove it wasn't yours."

1:28:36.125 --> 1:28:39.041
See, it wasn't enough
for her to take my pride.

1:28:40.458 --> 1:28:43.833
She wanted to take
my name, my home, everything.

1:28:44.583 --> 1:28:48.166
And she said, "Go on, Max, do it."

1:28:49.083 --> 1:28:52.041
"All you have to do is
pull the trigger and you'll be free."

1:28:54.375 --> 1:28:55.208
Please.

1:29:05.458 --> 1:29:07.250
[breathing heavily]

1:29:19.083 --> 1:29:20.791
Bullet went straight through her.

1:29:21.458 --> 1:29:24.208
She didn't fall right away.
She just stood there.

1:29:24.916 --> 1:29:26.208
So calm.

1:29:27.583 --> 1:29:28.916
Almost relieved.

1:29:32.250 --> 1:29:33.583
And then she was gone.

1:29:36.958 --> 1:29:39.750
All this time
I thought you still loved Rebecca.

1:29:50.916 --> 1:29:51.750
[gasps softly]

1:30:04.666 --> 1:30:06.041
Why didn't you tell me?

1:30:14.041 --> 1:30:15.250
I couldn't.

1:30:18.125 --> 1:30:20.458
I was so afraid I'd have lost you.

1:30:23.708 --> 1:30:25.833
Go to the police, tell them everything.

1:30:26.708 --> 1:30:30.291
You didn't know. Nothing'll happen to you.

1:30:33.791 --> 1:30:36.583
I understand
if you want nothing more to do with me.

1:30:38.041 --> 1:30:39.166
That's your choice.

1:30:43.166 --> 1:30:48.000
You made a mistake...
identifying the body.

1:30:49.000 --> 1:30:51.000
It was the grief, the trauma.

1:30:52.791 --> 1:30:55.125
Nobody knows but us.
Nobody will ever know.

1:30:57.541 --> 1:30:59.083
No, she hasn't won, Maxim.

1:30:59.916 --> 1:31:01.000
She hasn't won.

1:31:01.916 --> 1:31:03.000
We won't let her.

1:31:24.958 --> 1:31:26.583
You don't have to speak to them.

1:31:26.666 --> 1:31:29.333
[man] All stand
for the Right Honorable James Crouch.

1:31:31.458 --> 1:31:32.833
[reporters clamoring]

1:31:33.500 --> 1:31:34.458
[Frank] Stand back.

1:31:34.541 --> 1:31:37.125
[coroner] Order! Settle down.

1:31:37.208 --> 1:31:39.458
This is the... Sit down, sir.

1:31:39.541 --> 1:31:41.875
This is the coroner's inquest

1:31:41.958 --> 1:31:45.000
into the discovery
of the body of Rebecca de Winter.

1:31:45.083 --> 1:31:48.250
This is not
currently a criminal proceeding.

1:31:48.333 --> 1:31:51.416
We are here
only to ascertain how Mrs. de Winter died.

1:31:52.250 --> 1:31:55.833
The court will now hear from
Detective Welch of the Kerrith police.

1:31:56.625 --> 1:31:57.541
Detective Welch.

1:31:59.625 --> 1:32:02.958
The body
Mr. de Winter identified last year...

1:32:04.083 --> 1:32:05.083
was not his wife.

1:32:06.000 --> 1:32:10.958
In fact, Rebecca de Winter's body
was recovered from the cabin of her boat.

1:32:11.750 --> 1:32:13.000
That troubled me.

1:32:13.083 --> 1:32:15.458
As did the nature
of the damage to the vessel.

1:32:15.541 --> 1:32:17.291
And what was that nature?

1:32:17.375 --> 1:32:19.666
We found four holes below the waterline

1:32:19.750 --> 1:32:22.291
consistent with those
made by a ship's gaff.

1:32:23.458 --> 1:32:25.333
-Or spike.
-Suggesting what?

1:32:25.416 --> 1:32:27.125
That the boat was deliberately scuttled.

1:32:27.208 --> 1:32:28.708
[indistinct murmuring]

1:32:28.791 --> 1:32:31.166
In my opinion, Mr. Coroner,

1:32:31.250 --> 1:32:34.041
this inquest can return
one of only two verdicts.

1:32:35.250 --> 1:32:38.541
Suicide or unlawful killing.

1:32:44.916 --> 1:32:47.291
[coroner] Your wife made a trip
to London the day she died.

1:32:48.250 --> 1:32:49.250
It's time.

1:32:49.333 --> 1:32:52.833
In your statement to the police,
you say your wife seemed

1:32:52.916 --> 1:32:55.958
"preoccupied and unhappy"
when she returned.

1:32:56.666 --> 1:32:58.833
Don't be defensive.
Answer their questions calmly.

1:33:00.250 --> 1:33:02.250
[coroner] What was the purpose
of her trip?

1:33:03.000 --> 1:33:04.041
No idea.

1:33:04.125 --> 1:33:05.750
[coroner] Was it normal for your wife

1:33:05.833 --> 1:33:08.291
not to discuss such matters
with her husband?

1:33:08.375 --> 1:33:10.666
Are you implying
there were problems in my marriage?

1:33:11.250 --> 1:33:14.000
I'm trying to understand
how you apparently failed

1:33:14.083 --> 1:33:16.208
to recognize your own wife last year.

1:33:16.291 --> 1:33:19.125
She'd been two months at sea.
She drifted 20 miles.

1:33:19.208 --> 1:33:20.583
She was bloated, decomposing,

1:33:20.666 --> 1:33:23.333
her arms ripped off,`
and there was nothing left of her face.

1:33:23.416 --> 1:33:24.375
[audience clamoring]

1:33:24.458 --> 1:33:27.291
-[coroner] Order! Order!
-[banging gavel]

1:33:32.291 --> 1:33:34.208
[Maxim] I was arrogant and stupid.

1:33:35.541 --> 1:33:38.375
-I lost my nerve.
-[Mrs. de Winter] No, you were passionate.

1:33:39.000 --> 1:33:40.166
They'll believe it.

1:33:41.250 --> 1:33:43.583
Who else knows she saw a doctor in London?

1:33:46.916 --> 1:33:48.333
You, me, and the doctor.

1:33:49.458 --> 1:33:51.875
They're not likely
to find any physical evidence.

1:33:53.041 --> 1:33:54.541
Not after so long at sea.

1:33:57.000 --> 1:33:58.666
The doctor is all they have.

1:34:05.041 --> 1:34:08.333
I did tell Mr. Favell
he wasn't welcome, but he insisted.

1:34:09.125 --> 1:34:10.625
Thank you, Mrs. Danvers.

1:34:12.916 --> 1:34:14.625
What the hell do you want?

1:34:18.125 --> 1:34:20.166
Another whiskey and soda would be nice.

1:34:21.833 --> 1:34:23.041
It's about Rebecca,

1:34:23.125 --> 1:34:25.166
so you might want
to send your wife off to bed.

1:34:25.250 --> 1:34:28.083
I'm not going anywhere.
I know all about you and Rebecca.

1:34:28.791 --> 1:34:29.708
Oh, really?

1:34:30.791 --> 1:34:32.708
You know all about that, do you?

1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:35.833
You were close, Favell.

1:34:35.916 --> 1:34:37.833
If I'd caught you here
that night with her--

1:34:37.916 --> 1:34:39.208
He was never here that night.

1:34:39.291 --> 1:34:40.625
But she did invite me.

1:34:42.250 --> 1:34:43.500
And that's the point.

1:34:44.458 --> 1:34:48.500
Suicide or foul play,
that's what the chap said, wasn't it?

1:34:50.208 --> 1:34:52.666
Now, inviting someone over...

1:34:53.208 --> 1:34:55.666
doesn't really sound like
the sort of thing one would do

1:34:55.750 --> 1:34:58.375
if one was planning to end it all,
does it?

1:34:59.916 --> 1:35:03.208
And that's what's been
driving me mad this last year.

1:35:04.708 --> 1:35:06.708
But it's beginning to make sense.

1:35:08.208 --> 1:35:12.250
She finally decided to leave you.
Is that why you killed her?

1:35:13.666 --> 1:35:17.416
You've no proof.
It's your word against mine.

1:35:17.500 --> 1:35:18.333
No.

1:35:21.125 --> 1:35:23.208
It's your word against Rebecca's.

1:35:25.708 --> 1:35:27.833
"Come to Manders when you get this.

1:35:27.916 --> 1:35:29.750
I've something to tell you

1:35:29.833 --> 1:35:33.791
and I want to see you
as soon as possible. Rebecca."

1:35:35.083 --> 1:35:36.208
[Mrs. de Winter] Let me see.

1:35:37.333 --> 1:35:39.416
-[Maxim] Get out of my house.
-Don't rise to it, Maxim.

1:35:39.500 --> 1:35:41.541
[chuckling] Yes. Don't rise to it, Max.

1:35:43.291 --> 1:35:45.416
I only came by to thank you, really.

1:35:46.291 --> 1:35:49.125
You've been so generous over the years,

1:35:49.208 --> 1:35:51.916
sharing your wife
with so many of us chaps.

1:35:53.250 --> 1:35:56.416
Actually, I wondered
if I might try my luck with the new one.

1:35:59.291 --> 1:36:01.541
[Favell] There's that temper
I told you about.

1:36:02.541 --> 1:36:03.958
How much do you want?

1:36:06.375 --> 1:36:08.750
She's cleverer than she looks, this one,
isn't she?

1:36:10.833 --> 1:36:12.208
Seems to be a spot of blood.

1:36:13.250 --> 1:36:14.208
Oh, dearie me.

1:36:17.750 --> 1:36:18.583
[groans]

1:36:21.083 --> 1:36:22.333
She's right, though.

1:36:23.750 --> 1:36:25.333
I'm not a rich man, Max.

1:36:27.208 --> 1:36:28.916
Well, I'm too fond of gambling for that,

1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:33.125
but I do have a certain lifestyle
that I've come to enjoy.

1:36:35.750 --> 1:36:37.958
I imagine I could get by on around...

1:36:39.791 --> 1:36:42.250
£10,000 for the note

1:36:42.333 --> 1:36:45.416
and my silence
when I take the stand tomorrow.

1:36:45.500 --> 1:36:47.125
This is blackmail.

1:36:47.208 --> 1:36:49.583
-What are you doing?
-Calling the police.

1:36:49.666 --> 1:36:52.041
[Favell chuckles] Yeah. Call the police.

1:36:54.458 --> 1:36:56.000
Might even put us in the same cell.

1:36:57.583 --> 1:36:58.666
Not for long, though.

1:36:59.458 --> 1:37:02.000
I imagine you're looking
at the noose, Maxim.

1:37:09.250 --> 1:37:11.458
[coroner] At Inspector Welch's request,

1:37:11.541 --> 1:37:14.125
there's a change
to this morning's proceedings.

1:37:14.208 --> 1:37:15.791
We shall now hear

1:37:15.875 --> 1:37:19.125
from the de Winters' housekeeper,
Mrs. Danvers.

1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:28.958
[Welch] Safe to say
not much occurs at Manderley

1:37:29.041 --> 1:37:31.625
without your knowledge
or say-so, would I be right?

1:37:31.708 --> 1:37:34.791
I ensure the smooth running of the house.

1:37:35.375 --> 1:37:37.083
[Welch] Which is how
you came to be aware

1:37:37.166 --> 1:37:40.166
of the late Mrs. de Winter's
relationship with Mr. Favell.

1:37:41.041 --> 1:37:43.375
[Mrs. Danvers] Well, I was
aware they were, um, intimate.

1:37:43.458 --> 1:37:45.541
But my lady's
private affairs were her own.

1:37:45.625 --> 1:37:46.916
[Welch] So they should be.

1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:49.166
But since
these circumstances are far from normal,

1:37:49.250 --> 1:37:52.666
perhaps you'd share with the court
what you told me last night.

1:37:53.791 --> 1:37:56.375
I learned of a note
addressed to Mr. Favell.

1:37:57.166 --> 1:37:59.875
I urged him to share that note with you.

1:37:59.958 --> 1:38:04.000
A note Mr. de Winter
seemed keen to keep from this court.

1:38:04.083 --> 1:38:05.083
[Mrs. Danvers] Yes.

1:38:05.875 --> 1:38:10.750
The note was inviting Mr. Favell
to join Mrs. de Winter at the house...

1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:13.666
the night my lady died.

1:38:14.333 --> 1:38:19.500
Mr. de Winter offered money
in exchange for that note.

1:38:19.583 --> 1:38:21.666
[Welch] The note
was from Rebecca de Winter.

1:38:21.750 --> 1:38:22.750
[Mrs. Danvers] It was.

1:38:23.416 --> 1:38:26.208
She wrote
she had urgent news to share with him.

1:38:27.041 --> 1:38:32.250
And how much was Mr. Favell offered?

1:38:32.833 --> 1:38:34.458
£10,000.

1:38:34.541 --> 1:38:36.333
[audience murmuring]

1:38:40.250 --> 1:38:41.250
[Welch] A check...

1:38:42.708 --> 1:38:47.458
written by Mr. de Winter...
in exchange for the note.

1:38:47.541 --> 1:38:49.458
Where does it say that?
All you have is a check.

1:38:49.541 --> 1:38:52.041
-Nothing to say what it's for.
-[coroner] Order! Madam, order.

1:38:53.083 --> 1:38:58.291
Mrs. Danvers, do you think it's likely
Rebecca de Winter drowned herself?

1:38:59.208 --> 1:39:00.791
[Mrs. Danvers] No, sir. I do not.

1:39:00.875 --> 1:39:04.166
In the weeks, uh, leading up to her death,

1:39:04.250 --> 1:39:09.666
she had become
fatigued and was feeling sick.

1:39:10.791 --> 1:39:14.541
And she asked me
to let out the waistband in her trousers.

1:39:14.625 --> 1:39:17.291
Her belly was growing.

1:39:22.083 --> 1:39:24.750
Mrs. de Winter went to London
the day she died. Did she say why?

1:39:25.250 --> 1:39:26.416
-[Mrs. Danvers] No.
-Odd.

1:39:26.500 --> 1:39:29.708
It must've been something deeply personal
for her to have kept that from me.

1:39:29.791 --> 1:39:32.291
Like, say, an appointment with her doctor.

1:39:32.375 --> 1:39:35.333
Not her family doctor,
as you might expect, but someone discreet.

1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:38.500
Away from prying eyes

1:39:38.583 --> 1:39:42.000
as if news of her condition
was something she wished to keep private.

1:39:42.083 --> 1:39:47.333
A wish to share
only with her lover, Jack Favell.

1:39:48.166 --> 1:39:52.000
You murdering bastard.
[loudly] You're a murdering bastard!

1:39:52.083 --> 1:39:54.583
With my child! I hope they hang you.

1:39:54.666 --> 1:39:57.250
I hope they hang you!
You murdered Rebecca!

1:39:57.333 --> 1:39:58.833
Only two possible verdicts.

1:39:58.916 --> 1:40:02.708
I hope you agree, sir,
that there's no motive at all for suicide.

1:40:02.791 --> 1:40:05.583
But a clear one for murder.

1:40:05.666 --> 1:40:09.625
[coroner] This inquest is suspended
pending a criminal investigation.

1:40:09.708 --> 1:40:12.166
Ladies and gentlemen, court is adjourned.

1:40:13.416 --> 1:40:14.916
Nobody's above the law.

1:40:16.166 --> 1:40:18.458
[Maxim] Get your hands off me! Get off!

1:40:18.541 --> 1:40:19.833
[Welch] Mrs. Danvers.

1:40:20.416 --> 1:40:22.125
Say nothing. They can't prove anything.

1:40:22.208 --> 1:40:24.291
I want her appointment books,
diaries, address books,

1:40:24.375 --> 1:40:25.916
household finances, everything.

1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:29.041
She saw that doctor sometime
and she paid him.

1:40:30.083 --> 1:40:32.875
Roe, start placing calls
to women specialists in London.

1:40:32.958 --> 1:40:34.333
[crowd clamoring]

1:41:03.625 --> 1:41:05.541
[Mrs. Danvers] No. No.

1:41:12.416 --> 1:41:15.541
[Frank] I'm sorry, do you have
permission to search this place?

1:41:26.208 --> 1:41:27.125
[tires screech]

1:41:34.708 --> 1:41:36.250
Mrs. de Winter?

1:41:36.333 --> 1:41:37.708
-Oh, Frank!
-What?

1:41:37.791 --> 1:41:39.791
I need her checks, her bank statements.

1:41:39.875 --> 1:41:42.208
Anything that has
the name and address of her doctor.

1:41:42.291 --> 1:41:45.000
Right. Here it is. I know what you need.

1:41:47.375 --> 1:41:49.583
-I need a doctor.
-You need her doctor? There.

1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:53.500
[Mrs. de Winter] That must be it.

1:41:55.500 --> 1:41:56.583
[Mrs. Danvers] Shame on you.

1:41:57.125 --> 1:41:59.625
Shame on you for taking his side.

1:41:59.708 --> 1:42:02.250
I'm not taking anyone's side,
Mrs. Danvers. I--

1:42:02.333 --> 1:42:06.916
And you, Frank.
Licking Mr. de Winter's boots by day,

1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:09.708
and pawing at the cottage door at night.

1:42:09.791 --> 1:42:11.958
Sobbing like a schoolboy.

1:42:13.125 --> 1:42:15.125
She despised you all.

1:42:16.208 --> 1:42:19.041
The men in London,
the men at the Manderley parties.

1:42:19.625 --> 1:42:22.250
You were nothing but playthings for her.

1:42:23.541 --> 1:42:26.833
And why shouldn't a woman amuse herself?

1:42:30.458 --> 1:42:34.708
She lived her life
as she pleased, my Rebecca.

1:42:38.291 --> 1:42:40.458
No wonder a man had to kill her.

1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:44.375
[Mrs. de Winter] It must have hurt.

1:42:45.666 --> 1:42:49.583
Knowing your only friend in the world
took a secret like that to her grave.

1:42:53.125 --> 1:42:54.833
Pack your bags, Mrs. Danvers.

1:42:55.875 --> 1:42:57.708
I expect you gone by nightfall.

1:43:59.791 --> 1:44:01.250
[honking]

1:44:09.166 --> 1:44:10.416
[gasps]

1:44:20.041 --> 1:44:22.041
[bell tolling]

1:44:44.875 --> 1:44:47.916
-Miss?
-Terribly sorry, I've left my purse.

1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:49.750
[butler] Who was it you saw, Miss?

1:44:50.375 --> 1:44:51.666
[Mrs. de Winter] Dr. John Baker.

1:44:58.166 --> 1:44:59.333
Thank you.

1:45:02.791 --> 1:45:04.166
[knocking at door]

1:45:05.833 --> 1:45:06.875
[butler] Wait there.

1:45:16.541 --> 1:45:18.791
-[butler] Dr. Baker, sir.
-[Dr. Baker] Good evening, Tas.

1:45:23.541 --> 1:45:24.625
"Danvers."

1:45:26.125 --> 1:45:27.125
[door opens]

1:45:36.375 --> 1:45:39.166
[Dr. Baker] I see so many patients.

1:45:42.041 --> 1:45:43.750
I can't remember her.

1:45:43.833 --> 1:45:46.666
[Welch] Maybe it'll
come back when you see her file.

1:45:51.208 --> 1:45:54.375
[Dr. Baker] It would have been more
convenient to read the file to begin with.

1:45:57.416 --> 1:45:59.458
We'll do what we can to help.

1:45:59.541 --> 1:46:02.208
Oh, no. This is not as it should be.

1:46:04.166 --> 1:46:05.416
Where's she gone now?

1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:06.958
[Dr. Baker] Who?

1:46:08.583 --> 1:46:10.125
[butler] The young woman who was here.

1:46:13.333 --> 1:46:14.666
It's not here.

1:46:15.291 --> 1:46:17.041
I'll have a word with my secretary.

1:46:20.708 --> 1:46:22.875
[Dr. Baker] It's possible
she misplaced it.

1:46:23.458 --> 1:46:27.708
This girl. Is there any way
she could get out of here?

1:46:34.416 --> 1:46:35.250
[door opens]

1:46:36.333 --> 1:46:38.875
-[door creaking]
-[Mrs. de Winter inhales sharply]

1:46:58.458 --> 1:47:01.416
I read it, that's all.
I haven't changed a word Dr. Baker wrote.

1:47:01.500 --> 1:47:05.416
Rebecca Danvers.
Yes, now I remember. Terrible thing.

1:47:05.500 --> 1:47:08.333
That wasn't her real name.
And she wasn't pregnant.

1:47:08.416 --> 1:47:10.208
Then why would she use a false name?

1:47:10.291 --> 1:47:12.666
Why would she come all the way to London

1:47:12.750 --> 1:47:15.083
to make an appointment with you
and not her family doctor?

1:47:15.166 --> 1:47:18.208
Perhaps she wanted
to spare her family the news.

1:47:18.291 --> 1:47:19.958
That the baby wasn't her husband's?

1:47:20.041 --> 1:47:24.041
Inspector, I am not
that kind of women's specialist.

1:47:24.125 --> 1:47:28.375
I'm not an obstetrician.
My field is oncology.

1:47:28.458 --> 1:47:31.833
I treat cancers
of the reproductive system.

1:47:31.916 --> 1:47:34.416
The bloating, the fatigue.
They're common symptoms.

1:47:36.083 --> 1:47:37.333
She had cancer.

1:47:39.666 --> 1:47:41.333
There's her news for Jack Favell.

1:47:41.416 --> 1:47:43.791
That doesn't prove she killed herself.

1:47:43.875 --> 1:47:46.166
She wouldn't have wanted to suffer.

1:47:46.250 --> 1:47:48.375
Yes, she told me as much.

1:47:49.125 --> 1:47:51.750
She was very advanced
by the time she was symptomatic.

1:47:51.833 --> 1:47:53.250
Saw her first in April,

1:47:53.333 --> 1:47:56.583
by May, it was clear
she was too far gone for treatment.

1:47:56.666 --> 1:48:00.500
She only had weeks
and the pain would have been considerable.

1:48:01.875 --> 1:48:03.000
How did she do it?

1:48:05.583 --> 1:48:07.916
She took out her boat and scuttled it.

1:48:09.291 --> 1:48:10.625
She drowned herself.

1:48:15.791 --> 1:48:16.875
[latch drawing]

1:48:17.500 --> 1:48:18.875
[keys jingling]

1:48:18.958 --> 1:48:20.041
[lock turning]

1:48:53.458 --> 1:48:55.125
Stroke of luck for you there, Max.

1:49:04.791 --> 1:49:06.375
I bet you think you've won, don't you?

1:49:08.166 --> 1:49:11.125
Well, maybe the law can't get you.
I still can.

1:49:12.958 --> 1:49:14.916
Is there anything else you want to say?

1:49:16.083 --> 1:49:17.375
If there is, you better say it now.

1:49:31.666 --> 1:49:33.875
Do you know what I hate her for most?

1:49:35.458 --> 1:49:37.291
It's what she's taken from you.

1:49:38.333 --> 1:49:42.750
It's gone forever. That funny, young,
lost look I loved so much.

1:49:44.458 --> 1:49:46.291
You're not that person anymore.

1:49:46.916 --> 1:49:48.458
Don't hate her for that.

1:50:32.916 --> 1:50:35.958
What's that burning?
Oh, my God, that's Manderley.

1:50:37.916 --> 1:50:39.916
[staff clamoring]

1:50:44.541 --> 1:50:46.125
[Frith] Come on! Get away from there.

1:50:46.208 --> 1:50:49.041
Get off the lawn! Go! Come on!

1:50:50.791 --> 1:50:52.750
[Maxim] Get off the lawn!
Frith, get off the lawn!

1:50:52.833 --> 1:50:54.625
How many people are inside?
Is everyone out?

1:50:54.708 --> 1:50:58.083
-[Frith] I don't know, sir.
-You all right? What happened, Clarice?

1:50:58.166 --> 1:50:59.250
I saw her.

1:50:59.333 --> 1:51:01.291
[Mrs. de Winter] What do you mean?
Who did you see?

1:51:01.375 --> 1:51:02.791
[Clarice] Mrs. Danvers.

1:51:02.875 --> 1:51:06.000
[Maxim] Help her! Where are the hoses?

1:51:06.083 --> 1:51:10.291
-Where is she?
-She went to the boat house.

1:51:10.375 --> 1:51:11.708
[clamoring continues]

1:51:23.708 --> 1:51:26.625
[indistinct creaking and thudding]

1:51:28.625 --> 1:51:30.333
[glass shattering]

1:52:11.291 --> 1:52:13.000
[exclaiming]

1:52:18.958 --> 1:52:21.125
[Mrs. de Winter] Mrs. Danvers! Please!

1:52:22.583 --> 1:52:23.750
Please come away.

1:52:25.041 --> 1:52:27.041
You asked for my help. Here it is.

1:52:27.791 --> 1:52:29.500
Mrs. Danvers, please.

1:52:30.500 --> 1:52:32.833
He killed the only person I loved.

1:52:34.416 --> 1:52:36.000
I can't let you have Manderley.

1:52:37.333 --> 1:52:38.875
It was ours, you see.

1:52:40.750 --> 1:52:42.208
You don't have to do this.

1:52:42.291 --> 1:52:46.750
I know you'll stand by him.
But you'll never know happiness.

1:52:50.250 --> 1:52:51.291
Yes, I will.

1:53:25.416 --> 1:53:26.916
[grunting and muttering]

1:53:27.375 --> 1:53:29.250
[gasping]

1:53:33.625 --> 1:53:34.500
[panting]

1:53:53.041 --> 1:53:55.750
[Mrs. de Winter] Last night,
I dreamt I went to Manderley again.

1:53:58.458 --> 1:54:01.208
I dreamt of Mrs. Danvers and of Rebecca.

1:54:05.833 --> 1:54:10.416
But this morning I woke up
and left the dead behind.

1:54:12.833 --> 1:54:16.958
And as I sit before the mirror
in our stuffy little room in Cairo,

1:54:18.500 --> 1:54:22.000
just another stop
on our quest to find a real home,

1:54:24.166 --> 1:54:26.083
I can see the woman I am now.

1:54:28.416 --> 1:54:31.250
And I know
that I have made the right decision...

1:54:34.416 --> 1:54:37.625
to save the one thing
worth walking through flames for.

1:54:40.708 --> 1:54:41.583
Love.

1:54:43.250 --> 1:54:45.250
[upbeat music playing]

1:54:58.750 --> 1:55:00.208
[waves crashing]

1:55:04.583 --> 1:55:06.583
[dramatic music playing]
