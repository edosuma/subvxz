WEBVTT

00:20.820 --> 00:23.516
Do you want the spot?

00:23.550 --> 00:24.642
Do I want the spot?

00:24.690 --> 00:26.555
Oh, I'm sorry,
I thought...

00:26.590 --> 00:27.716
Nothing.

00:27.760 --> 00:30.354
What's the spot?

00:30.390 --> 00:32.324
Oh, well, if you stand
right here, you can see

00:32.360 --> 00:34.123
the painter's signature.

00:34.160 --> 00:36.196
The light catches it
just right.

00:36.230 --> 00:39.199
Ah, then, sure, yeah,
I do want the spot.

00:41.770 --> 00:43.806
Where am I looking?

00:43.840 --> 00:48.174
Oh... the inside top
of the right thigh.

01:06.660 --> 01:08.628
That wasn't a pickup line.

01:08.660 --> 01:10.696
I did think
you wanted the spot.

01:10.730 --> 01:14.291
I know, I just
like your voice.

01:14.340 --> 01:18.231
I wanted to
hear It again.

01:18.270 --> 01:19.737
That's a made-up accent,
isn't it?

01:19.780 --> 01:24.604
Yes, I use it to impress
women in museums.

01:24.650 --> 01:26.515
(both laughing)

01:26.550 --> 01:29.212
Australians don't
ask what people do?

01:29.250 --> 01:30.217
Oh, we do.

01:30.250 --> 01:32.252
We just wait.
For?

01:32.290 --> 01:34.155
Events to evolve.
Oh,

01:34.190 --> 01:35.851
and how might they evolve?

01:35.890 --> 01:37.721
Well, you will ask
me in a few minutes

01:37.760 --> 01:39.159
what I do for a living.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.155
Because I'm
an American?

01:40.200 --> 01:41.827
Mm-hmm, yes, and because
it's a natural question,

01:41.860 --> 01:44.124
and that is why I have
to ask you to dinner.

01:44.170 --> 01:45.296
(laughs)

01:45.330 --> 01:47.537
You have to ask me to dinner
before I ask you what you do?

01:47.570 --> 01:50.209
Yes, do you promise
to meet me?

01:50.240 --> 01:52.208
I can't do that.

01:52.240 --> 01:54.777
First tell me what you do,
and then I'll decide.

01:54.810 --> 01:57.779
I like you, Diane.

01:59.250 --> 02:02.413
And I'm only doing this
because it's my job.

02:02.450 --> 02:04.315
You've been served.

02:04.350 --> 02:06.454
(school bell ringing)

02:06.490 --> 02:07.354
ZACH:
You're not becoming

02:07.390 --> 02:09.824
one of those
overprotectlve moms, are you?

02:09.860 --> 02:11.589
I might be.

02:11.630 --> 02:13.188
Mrs. Hartly?

02:13.230 --> 02:14.857
Wasn't she your teacher
in middle school?
Yeah.

02:14.900 --> 02:16.822
Mom.

02:16.870 --> 02:18.394
Lillian and
Mrs. Brooks.

02:18.430 --> 02:20.330
Where have they been?

02:20.370 --> 02:22.702
"Those poor,
disadvantaged children."

02:22.740 --> 02:24.401
"Can you imagine going
to a public school?"

02:24.440 --> 02:27.671
Since when did I raise
such sarcastic kids?

02:27.710 --> 02:29.575
Who's that?

02:29.610 --> 02:31.271
I think that's
Kelsey's dad.

02:31.310 --> 02:33.369
No, I think
they moved away.

02:33.420 --> 02:34.876
I think
he wants you.

02:34.920 --> 02:36.911
Maybe he's a teacher?

02:38.350 --> 02:40.318
Yes?

02:40.360 --> 02:41.315
Mrs. Florrick?

02:41.360 --> 02:42.850
Yes.

02:46.760 --> 02:48.751
So are you dating
anyone?

02:49.800 --> 02:51.768
Off and on.

02:51.800 --> 02:55.258
You are the definition
of "off and on," Will.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.801
You got to get
serious sometime.

02:56.840 --> 02:58.262
Who says?

02:58.310 --> 03:00.278
The Pope, I think.

03:00.310 --> 03:01.470
(both laugh)

03:02.610 --> 03:04.578
Well, your time's up,

03:04.610 --> 03:07.477
and someone's waiting
to cut in.

03:10.250 --> 03:11.080
DIANE:
Where are you, Will?

03:11.120 --> 03:12.018
WILL (over phone):
Leaving a wedding.

03:12.050 --> 03:13.483
I think Wendy Scott-Carr
is coming after me

03:13.520 --> 03:14.509
with a grand jury summons.

03:14.560 --> 03:18.348
I, uh, Will,
we're on speakerphone.

03:18.390 --> 03:21.325
Uh, the summons isn't about you.

03:21.360 --> 03:23.294
We got served, too--
Alicia, myself, and David Lee.

03:23.330 --> 03:24.467
What?

03:24.500 --> 03:25.899
Why?

03:25.930 --> 03:28.569
It's one of David Lee's
divorces-- the Huntley divorce.

03:28.600 --> 03:29.806
The wife
of the venture capitalist?

03:29.840 --> 03:30.966
We did well by her, didn't we?

03:31.010 --> 03:34.377
Half his business assets,
the house in Highland Park,

03:34.410 --> 03:35.934
and sole custody
of their daughter.

03:35.980 --> 03:37.470
She's not suing us.

03:37.510 --> 03:38.477
The husband is.

03:38.510 --> 03:39.613
What, for being too effective?

03:39.650 --> 03:40.617
No.

03:40.650 --> 03:42.515
Alienation of affection.

03:42.550 --> 03:44.984
You're kidding.

03:45.020 --> 03:46.248
What is this, the '305?

03:46.290 --> 03:49.953
No, we're one of seven states
that still has it on the books.

03:49.990 --> 03:50.957
Yeah, as a joke,

03:50.990 --> 03:52.696
as a Depression-era curiosity.

03:52.730 --> 03:54.322
What, he's saying
we split them up?

03:54.360 --> 03:55.429
That's crazy.

03:55.460 --> 03:57.621
Yes, and his lawyer
is coming here in a few hours

03:57.670 --> 03:58.989
to talk settlement.

03:59.030 --> 04:00.338
You think
the timing's suspicious?

04:00.370 --> 04:01.337
I do.

04:01.370 --> 04:03.531
Three days
before we refinance?

04:03.570 --> 04:05.561
We're going through a short-
term liquidity problem--

04:05.610 --> 04:06.577
nothing to worry about.

04:06.610 --> 04:07.508
Okay, I'm coming in.

04:07.540 --> 04:09.542
We need to get this
off the books fast.

04:09.580 --> 04:10.945
Where's David Lee?
What's he saying about this?

04:10.980 --> 04:12.447
DAVID:
What the hell?

04:12.480 --> 04:15.517
Now I'm being penalized
for doing my job well?

04:16.420 --> 04:20.880
I, uh, uh, s-s-see you
in a few minutes, Will.

04:20.920 --> 04:21.887
You know what?

04:21.920 --> 04:22.887
We countersue.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.557
It's the principle of the thing.

04:25.930 --> 04:29.320
So, David, not to pry,
but did you enlist?

04:29.370 --> 04:30.598
Yes,

04:30.630 --> 04:31.597
I was getting bored.

04:31.630 --> 04:32.699
The Yale Club.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.867
I was served backstage
during Gilbert and Sullivan.

04:34.900 --> 04:35.889
Alicia,

04:35.940 --> 04:38.465
you were on the Huntley
divorce your first year.

04:38.510 --> 04:39.499
He was sleeping
with some stripper.

04:39.540 --> 04:40.632
Good, that's
what we need.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.898
There can't be
alienation of affection

04:42.950 --> 04:44.770
if the husband was cheating.

04:44.810 --> 04:47.415
Get Kalinda.

04:50.450 --> 04:53.419
There's, uh, there's
nothing I need to know here,

04:53.460 --> 04:54.415
is there, David?

04:54.460 --> 04:55.415
What do you mean?

04:55.460 --> 04:57.519
I think you know
what I mean.

04:57.560 --> 04:59.528
This was a straight
division of assets.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.755
We were there for her,
we did right by her.

05:01.800 --> 05:03.427
Good.

05:03.470 --> 05:04.494
(elevator bell dings)

05:04.530 --> 05:06.589
Hi.
Hey.

05:06.640 --> 05:07.732
Doesn't let up, does it?

05:07.770 --> 05:08.737
Not often.

05:08.770 --> 05:09.839
Is everything
all right?

05:09.870 --> 05:11.406
Yeah, I was
at a wedding.

05:11.440 --> 05:13.908
No, I mean
the Wendy Scott-Carr thing.

05:13.940 --> 05:17.341
Yeah, don't worry, something
I'm handling, you know.

05:17.380 --> 05:19.871
This is an easy lawsuit.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.774
We just need to get to the wife.
She...

05:23.890 --> 05:25.846
I thought I'd dress
up for this lawyer.

05:25.890 --> 05:27.915
(stifling laughter):
Mm-hmm.

05:27.960 --> 05:30.588
We just need to get to the wife,
get her on record.

05:30.630 --> 05:32.450
What's her name?
April Huntley.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.422
Right, she hired us,
he didn't.

05:34.460 --> 05:36.564
She's the one
who wanted the divorce.

05:36.600 --> 05:37.567
We didn't force
anything on her.

05:37.600 --> 05:38.567
DIANE:
She's still a client?

05:38.600 --> 05:39.567
Julius is primary

05:39.600 --> 05:40.760
on her business holdings.

05:40.800 --> 05:41.767
I'll call him?

05:41.800 --> 05:43.062
No, Will, you talk to her.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.134
Why?

05:44.170 --> 05:45.637
Because Will
can talk to her.

05:45.670 --> 05:47.433
WILL:
Do we know her
husband's attorney?

05:47.480 --> 05:49.129
No, someone from LA.

05:49.180 --> 05:49.942
L.A.?

05:49.980 --> 05:51.777
Why L.A.?
(elevator bell dings)

05:54.150 --> 05:56.880
Hello?

05:56.920 --> 05:58.547
Hello.

05:58.590 --> 06:00.410
It's freezing outside.

06:00.460 --> 06:02.451
Yes, I know,
it's January.

06:02.490 --> 06:04.458
All this affection
for seasons.

06:04.490 --> 06:06.128
I don't understand.

06:06.160 --> 06:07.627
I think
it's about change.

06:07.660 --> 06:09.969
Yeah, change--
it's monstrous.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.059
Hmm.
May I help you?

06:12.100 --> 06:14.534
I'm Burl Preston
for Diane Lockhart.

06:14.570 --> 06:15.662
WILL:_
He's really surng us.

06:15.700 --> 06:17.099
We thought you could sign
an affidavit

06:17.140 --> 06:18.459
saying you asked us
for the divorce.

06:18.510 --> 06:20.603
APRIL:
Jake is such a turd.

06:20.640 --> 06:22.574
He's really suing you?

06:22.610 --> 06:24.703
April, how does Jake know
Burl Preston?

06:24.750 --> 06:27.048
Burl who?

06:27.080 --> 06:28.547
Preston.

06:28.580 --> 06:31.515
He's an LA. lawyer,
a top L.A. lawyer.

06:31.550 --> 06:33.188
Oh, it must be
from one of his companies.

06:33.220 --> 06:34.585
Why?

06:34.620 --> 06:37.783
I'm just surprised
he would take this case.

06:37.830 --> 06:40.094
Maybe he wants part
of the $44 million.

06:40.130 --> 06:42.894
Will, you there?

06:42.930 --> 06:45.490
Yes, I'm here.

06:45.530 --> 06:48.693
How did you know your husband
was suing for $44 million?

06:48.740 --> 06:50.162
How did I know?

06:50.210 --> 06:51.837
You said.

06:51.870 --> 06:52.871
No, I didn't.

06:52.910 --> 06:55.834
Ms. Lockhart, I always
seem to be visiting you

06:55.880 --> 06:57.074
during the
cold months.

06:57.110 --> 06:59.078
Yes, I don't suppose
you would fly us out to LA.

06:59.110 --> 07:00.441
for the depositions?

07:00.480 --> 07:01.811
Ah, now there's an idea.

07:01.850 --> 07:04.148
(door opens, Burl chuckles)

07:05.620 --> 07:07.508
I, uh, I don't think you've met.

07:07.560 --> 07:10.529
Captain David Lee--
I was the divorce attorney.

07:10.560 --> 07:12.926
So you're the one
who wrested control

07:12.960 --> 07:15.190
of my client's companies?
Uh,

07:15.230 --> 07:17.619
no, I think he should look
to his wife for that.

07:17.670 --> 07:18.796
We just got her...
David, stop.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.665
Mr. Gardner, hello.

07:21.700 --> 07:22.837
Good to see you again.
They have her.

07:22.870 --> 07:24.758
They have
Mrs. Huntley.

07:24.810 --> 07:28.530
That's right, Mr. and Mrs.
Huntley have reconciled.

07:28.580 --> 07:30.070
You broke up
their marriage

07:30.110 --> 07:32.647
and hastily sold off
their most valuable asset.

07:32.680 --> 07:34.170
It was a fair division
of assets.

07:34.220 --> 07:36.176
For you, yes.

07:36.220 --> 07:39.610
Bubble Elastic was a company
owned by Mr. Huntley.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.184
Mrs. Huntley gained
control of it

07:41.220 --> 07:42.949
during the divorce.
Exactly,

07:42.990 --> 07:44.651
she gained control.

07:44.690 --> 07:47.227
Until you helped her sell it
earlier this year at a loss.

07:47.260 --> 07:51.196
It's now_ worth
$44 million.

07:51.230 --> 07:54.131
This is not a_
harassment surt.

07:54.170 --> 07:56.502
You conspired to
end this marriage

07:56.540 --> 07:58.064
for your
financial gain.

07:58.110 --> 08:02.672
As a result, my client lost
out on a $44 million windfall,

08:02.710 --> 08:05.747
and that is _the
amount you Will pay.

08:11.290 --> 08:13.485
Uh-oh.

08:26.940 --> 08:29.135
(overlapping chatter)

08:29.170 --> 08:30.262
Wait a minute!

08:30.310 --> 08:32.904
This was always part of
the equity partner agreement.

08:32.940 --> 08:35.033
I have no_contro|
over family law.

08:35.080 --> 08:37.275
Why should I be held
accountable for his screwups?

08:37.310 --> 08:38.208
My screwups?
I did not...

08:38.250 --> 08:39.979
WILL: Okay, okay, hold
it together, guys.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.045
No, I'm not going
to take that from him.

08:42.080 --> 08:43.638
Him? Julius.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.112
My name is Julius
All right, all right, listen up!

08:45.150 --> 08:47.050
We need to win.

08:47.090 --> 08:49.923
Malpractice insurance
won't cover this.

08:49.960 --> 08:51.757
It's an intentional tort,

08:51.790 --> 08:54.054
so we are all on the hook
for $1.2 million.

08:55.100 --> 08:57.125
Excuse me?

08:57.170 --> 08:59.229
We're on the hook
for $1.2 million.

08:59.270 --> 09:00.999
All of the equity partners
share everything

09:01.040 --> 09:02.860
in sickness
and in health.

09:02.910 --> 09:04.662
Who is he?

09:04.710 --> 09:07.770
Um, I just signed the equity
partner agreement last week,

09:07.810 --> 09:11.177
and you're telling me
I owe you $1.2 million?

09:11.210 --> 09:12.142
Only if we lose, Eli.

09:12.180 --> 09:13.875
JULIUS: Which, given
David Lee and his methods,

09:13.920 --> 09:15.069
seems highly likely.

09:15.120 --> 09:16.212
Oh, go to hell, Julius.

09:16.250 --> 09:17.080
There, I said
your name. Happy?

09:17.120 --> 09:19.042
I'll be happy when
you're disbarred.

09:19.090 --> 09:21.285
How about that?
You're a moron!

09:21.320 --> 09:22.821
(overlapping chattering)
Bring it on.

09:22.860 --> 09:24.225
What is going on here?

09:24.260 --> 09:26.251
(overlapping chatter,
elevator bell dings)

09:27.960 --> 09:29.962
One happy family.

09:33.400 --> 09:35.960
Could you, uh, buzz
Diane Lockhart?

09:36.000 --> 09:37.831
Excuse me, this is
a place of business.

09:37.870 --> 09:38.837
Yes, hi.

09:38.870 --> 09:40.735
Tori, get security.
If you want

09:40.780 --> 09:42.748
to serve someone, you can
leave it with the receptionist.

09:42.780 --> 09:43.974
No, I'm not here to...

09:44.010 --> 09:46.376
I'm here for Diane
on a personal matter.

09:46.410 --> 09:47.775
Yeah, it's all personal.

09:47.820 --> 09:48.775
Mike,

09:48.820 --> 09:50.014
can you escort
this process server

09:50.050 --> 09:51.085
down to the lobby,
please?

09:51.120 --> 09:52.041
Sir.

09:52.090 --> 09:53.785
Please give this to her,

09:53.820 --> 09:55.959
okay?

09:55.990 --> 09:57.150
You can leave it
with the receptionist.

09:58.990 --> 10:00.958
KALIN DA:
The photos

10:01.000 --> 10:02.763
are real.

10:02.800 --> 10:04.028
He did meet and sleep
with the stripper.

10:04.070 --> 10:06.368
But...?

10:06.400 --> 10:08.937
It wasn't purely spontaneous.

10:08.970 --> 10:09.959
We did not.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.102
No, we didn't.

10:11.140 --> 10:13.074
Mrs. Huntley
wanted

10:13.110 --> 10:14.338
full custody of her daughter.

10:14.380 --> 10:18.202
That was unlikely, so David Lee
asked me to set up a DUI trap.

10:18.250 --> 10:21.219
The stripper wasn't supposed
to sleep with him,

10:21.250 --> 10:23.343
just get him drinking
above the legal limit,

10:23.390 --> 10:25.210
and then a cop I called
pulled him over.

10:25.250 --> 10:26.319
I mean, it worked.

10:26.350 --> 10:29.251
The husband had a DUI just
before the custody hearing.

10:29.290 --> 10:30.382
He lost custody.

10:32.960 --> 10:35.258
You have such lofty goals
when you start a law firm--

10:35.300 --> 10:37.188
dreams of fighting
injustice,

10:37.230 --> 10:39.061
righting wrongs.
Again, the point

10:39.100 --> 10:40.988
wasn't to get him
to sleep with her.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.803
Mr. Huntley acted
on his own there.

10:42.840 --> 10:44.034
WILL: Was this discussed
with the client?

10:44.070 --> 10:45.037
KALINDA:
Mrs. Huntley?

10:45.070 --> 10:46.799
Not to my knowledge.

10:46.840 --> 10:48.239
She just wanted full custody
of her daughter.

10:48.280 --> 10:50.145
This was David Lee
g0ing the extra mile.

10:50.180 --> 10:52.876
Yep, good old David Lee.

10:52.920 --> 10:55.172
Was this written down anywhere--
this DUI trap?

10:55.220 --> 10:58.087
Possibly in David's notes,
but I'm not sure.

10:58.120 --> 11:00.156
Okay, we'll try
to limit discovery.

11:00.190 --> 11:02.055
Kalinda, you do
a document sweep.

11:02.090 --> 11:03.728
We need to know
what skeletons

11:03.760 --> 11:04.954
are rattling
around.

11:04.990 --> 11:06.059
And, Alicia,
you're the David Lee wrangler.

11:07.260 --> 11:09.023
Will, do you have a minute?

11:09.060 --> 11:11.221
Thank you, Alicia, Kalinda.

11:12.970 --> 11:14.733
We can't catch a breath, can we?

11:14.770 --> 11:15.998
You need to hire a lawyer.

11:16.040 --> 11:18.065
We can handle this.
No.

11:19.110 --> 11:20.372
I mean Wendy Scott-Carr.

11:20.410 --> 11:22.207
I have a few names.

11:22.240 --> 11:23.309
No, it's all right.

11:23.350 --> 11:26.046
I'm interviewing Jason Cline
and Lionel Deerfield.

11:26.080 --> 11:28.913
They're good.

11:28.950 --> 11:31.043
We don't want this to
go to a grand jury.

11:31.090 --> 11:32.910
I know.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.212
You're okay?
I am.

11:35.260 --> 11:38.855
_ If this starts
impacting the firm,

11:38.890 --> 11:41.029
we'll have to talk.

11:41.060 --> 11:44.996
Will, there is nothing
we'll ever have to talk about.

11:45.030 --> 11:46.736
This is a_state's
attorney Witch hunt.

11:46.770 --> 11:47.964
That's all.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.934
We're in this
together.

11:49.970 --> 11:53.098
(indistinct arguing)

11:56.510 --> 11:58.205
It's probably too early
to drink.

11:58.250 --> 11:59.911
Another two hours.

12:01.120 --> 12:02.439
You need a lawyer.
WILL:
I need a lawyer.

12:02.480 --> 12:03.845
Thanks for
coming in, Jason.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.209
I seem to be
the state's attorney's

12:05.250 --> 12:06.751
target of the month.

12:06.790 --> 12:08.849
Yeah.
_ I think this
investigation

12:08.890 --> 12:10.983
into judicial bribery
is getting more serious.

12:11.030 --> 12:13.123
Don't worry. You'll be fine.

12:14.160 --> 12:15.388
I will?
Oh, yeah.

12:15.430 --> 12:17.193
This is a little hiccup.

12:17.230 --> 12:18.527
The state's attorney
just needs to...

12:18.570 --> 12:20.094
throw its weight around
a little bit.

12:20.140 --> 12:22.165
What about a grand jury?
Oh.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.202
Grand juries.

12:24.240 --> 12:26.003
They're a joke.

12:26.040 --> 12:27.769
I'm a fighter.

12:27.810 --> 12:29.846
We'll fight them together.

12:31.180 --> 12:33.319
APRIL:
He told me my husband
was cheating on me.

12:33.350 --> 12:34.840
He showed me pictures.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.177
I was stunned.

12:36.220 --> 12:38.188
I trusted my lavwer.
I trusted my firm.

12:38.220 --> 12:40.085
But your husband
did cheat on you?

12:40.120 --> 12:41.155
No. He said
he had never

12:41.190 --> 12:42.555
met that woman before.

12:42.590 --> 12:44.956
She sat down next to him
and offered to buy a drink.

12:44.990 --> 12:48.221
But this is him kissing her,
isn't it?

12:48.260 --> 12:50.421
It was a peck--
a peck on the cheek.

12:50.470 --> 12:51.823
And didn't he
say this was

12:51.870 --> 12:53.064
a setup by your
divorce lawyer?

12:53.100 --> 12:55.136
Would you like to take over
the questioning, Mr. Preston?

12:55.170 --> 12:57.229
No, but I thought
we might cut to the chase.

12:57.270 --> 12:58.464
Okay. Here's the chase.

12:58.510 --> 13:00.978
You came to David Lee
to divorce your husband?

13:01.010 --> 13:03.444
No. I came to _David Lee
for adVIce.

13:03.480 --> 13:04.401
Is this your signature

13:04.450 --> 13:06.042
on the attorney-client
retainer agreement?

13:07.920 --> 13:09.888
And what does it say
on the top there?

13:09.920 --> 13:11.217
"Intent to divorce."

13:11.250 --> 13:12.547
BURL:
April, did you try

13:12.590 --> 13:14.888
to reconcile with your husband
before the divorce?

13:14.920 --> 13:16.080
Yes, twice.

13:16.120 --> 13:18.224
And when you told

13:18.260 --> 13:19.249
your divorce
attorney this?

13:19.290 --> 13:20.996
He showed me
these pictures.

13:21.030 --> 13:22.190
Of course, I showed her
the pictures.

13:22.230 --> 13:23.959
She was wanting
to reconcile with the bum.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.228
BURL:
And you didn't
want that?

13:25.270 --> 13:26.294
DAVID:
If I'm a shoe salesman
and you come

13:26.330 --> 13:28.469
to buy shoes, it's not my job
to talk you out of it.

13:28.500 --> 13:30.263
It's my job to ﬁnd
a good shoe for you.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.265
BURL:
Twice, she tried
to reconcile.

13:31.310 --> 13:34.131
Twice, she came to you
to call off the divorce.

13:34.180 --> 13:36.330
Twice, you convinced her not to.

13:36.380 --> 13:38.302
Because he was shtupping
a stripper.

13:38.350 --> 13:39.578
That was not proven.
Mr. Huntley denies...

13:39.610 --> 13:41.612
Oh, my God. He does?

13:41.650 --> 13:44.346
How could I have
been so mistaken?

13:44.390 --> 13:46.346
DIANE:
Mr. Lee was speaking
sarcastically.

13:46.390 --> 13:47.459
Who do you call a true friend?

13:47.490 --> 13:49.185
The one who sees your husband
shtupping a stripper

13:49.220 --> 13:50.323
and says nothing, or the
one who says something?

13:50.360 --> 13:51.952
Did you hire the stripper?

13:53.130 --> 13:55.291
Did I what?
Did I hire this woman?

13:55.330 --> 13:56.456
Are you crazy?

13:56.500 --> 13:58.024
Please, answer the question.

13:59.670 --> 14:02.059
No, I did not hire the stripper.

14:02.100 --> 14:04.204
BURL:
You perjure yourself
in here, sir,

14:04.240 --> 14:07.073
it's the equivalent
of perjuring yourself in court.

14:09.040 --> 14:10.268
Thank you.

14:10.310 --> 14:12.449
Go ahead and ask
the question again.

14:12.480 --> 14:16.371
Did you hire
this woman?

14:24.590 --> 14:26.182
No, I did not
hire the stripper

14:26.230 --> 14:27.458
pictured in
those photos.

14:27.500 --> 14:30.367
I did lose my virginity
when I was 14.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.027
I do have
a secret crush

14:32.070 --> 14:33.537
on Jacqueline Onassis.
Okay, thank you.

14:33.570 --> 14:35.231
I didn't cry when the
Challenger exploded.

14:35.270 --> 14:37.409
Thank you.

14:37.440 --> 14:38.930
Basically, you're
in trouble.

14:38.970 --> 14:40.369
Thanks.

14:40.410 --> 14:42.332
I'm not hereto
sugarcoat it, Will.

14:42.380 --> 14:44.109
You hire me, I'll give
it to you straight.

14:44.150 --> 14:46.914
They're investigating you
for arranging bribery,

14:46.950 --> 14:49.339
and from the sound of it,
they have something.

14:49.380 --> 14:50.938
They have
circumstantial something.

14:50.990 --> 14:52.514
For a grand jury, that's enough.

14:52.550 --> 14:54.279
And your defense?

14:54.320 --> 14:55.412
Turn evidence.

14:55.460 --> 14:56.085
Against who?
I don't have anything.

14:56.120 --> 14:57.485
Everybody has
something.

14:57.530 --> 14:58.519
Give it to them.
(scoffs)

14:58.560 --> 15:00.494
For a lighter
sentence.

15:00.530 --> 15:01.690
How light?

15:01.730 --> 15:03.391
Two years, maybe.

15:03.430 --> 15:04.988
Probation?

15:05.030 --> 15:06.520
No. Minimum security.

15:06.570 --> 15:09.198
Loss of your
law license.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.179
I could never_
practice law again?

15:13.210 --> 15:15.235
That's right.

15:18.010 --> 15:20.114
(laughs)
God, you're a bundle of laughs.

15:20.150 --> 15:21.515
Yep.

15:21.550 --> 15:23.484
Old age.

15:23.520 --> 15:25.488
My cynicism seeping through

15:25.520 --> 15:27.715
like oil through a garden
of leaves.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.716
(chuckles)

15:29.760 --> 15:32.285
Are you guys being sued?

15:32.330 --> 15:34.651
I saw Burl Preston
out there.

15:34.700 --> 15:36.452
Good-bye, Lionel.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.365
Thank you.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.107
Is it true?

15:49.140 --> 15:50.505
What?
The Challenger?

15:50.550 --> 15:51.744
Yes, I didn't cry.

15:51.780 --> 15:53.372
David.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.638
Did you hire that stripper
for a DUI trap?

15:55.680 --> 15:57.511
$44 million.

15:57.550 --> 15:59.541
That's what I just
saved you in there.

15:59.590 --> 16:01.410
They can't prove we
hired that stripper,

16:01.460 --> 16:03.257
the lawsuit
goes away.

16:03.290 --> 16:04.382
And you want to
question that?

16:04.430 --> 16:06.182
I want to question you
perjuring yourself.

16:06.230 --> 16:08.698
I told him the truth--
I did not hire her.

16:08.730 --> 16:10.391
Kalinda did?

16:10.430 --> 16:12.398
This is an adult's game, Diane.

16:12.430 --> 16:14.489
I'm fine if you
don't want to play,

16:14.540 --> 16:17.566
but then don't ask
the questions.

16:17.610 --> 16:19.430
And what about Alicia?

16:19.470 --> 16:21.404
What about her?

16:21.440 --> 16:22.475
She's being deposed next.

16:22.510 --> 16:23.499
Will she contradict you?

16:31.490 --> 16:32.787
Hi.

16:32.820 --> 16:35.015
Hi.

16:38.790 --> 16:41.793
When you had your troubles
with the Treasury,

16:41.830 --> 16:43.695
the Treasury monitor...
Yes?

16:43.730 --> 16:45.561
the lavwer you used--
she was good?

16:45.600 --> 16:47.591
Yeah, she was great.
What was her name?

16:47.640 --> 16:49.062
Elsbeth Tascioni.

16:49.100 --> 16:50.306
Are you looking
for a lawyer?

16:50.340 --> 16:51.500
I might be.

16:52.570 --> 16:54.572
Too bad there are none here.

16:56.340 --> 16:58.342
What's going on,
Will?

16:59.780 --> 17:02.146
You don't have to_tell me.
It's not anything.

17:02.180 --> 17:05.149
I just don't want
to make life more complicated.

17:05.190 --> 17:07.579
She's discreet, this woman?
Yes.

17:07.620 --> 17:09.178
Um, she's also different.

17:09.220 --> 17:11.552
I'm not sure how well
you'll get along.

17:11.590 --> 17:13.194
Well, is it worth a meeting?

17:13.230 --> 17:15.528
It is.

17:15.560 --> 17:17.164
Um...

17:17.200 --> 17:19.259
donTjudge
by first impressions.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.539
Promise.

17:28.580 --> 17:29.569
Hi.

17:29.610 --> 17:30.679
Alicia, how are you?

17:30.710 --> 17:33.178
Good. David, what's up?

17:33.220 --> 17:35.108
I've done something for you.

17:35.150 --> 17:37.141
Your children's trust--
I decided to get

17:37.190 --> 17:38.339
a jump on it.

17:38.390 --> 17:39.709
Okay, thanks.
No problem.

17:39.750 --> 17:41.411
Had to get done.

17:41.460 --> 17:43.155
It was complicated
because it had to anticipate

17:43.190 --> 17:45.385
all the ways you might go
with your husband.

17:45.430 --> 17:47.227
Separation, divorce.

17:47.260 --> 17:48.488
(sighs)

17:48.530 --> 17:51.226
So... you know,
my memory--

17:51.270 --> 17:52.567
not so good.

17:52.600 --> 17:54.158
Aanay, with your
upcoming deposition,

17:54.200 --> 17:55.861
I just wanted to check
my facts with you,

17:55.900 --> 17:57.663
make sure we're in agreement.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.803
You know?

17:59.840 --> 18:01.671
ELI:
Will they ever dump

18:01.710 --> 18:02.734
David Lee?

18:02.780 --> 18:05.601
No. He brings in
too much money.

18:05.650 --> 18:08.244
What if he was costing
too much money?

18:08.280 --> 18:11.113
Well, depends
on how much money.

18:11.150 --> 18:14.153
It's not about love;
it's about commerce.

18:14.190 --> 18:16.158
So if I made
a play?

18:16.190 --> 18:18.249
It would depend on the play.

18:18.290 --> 18:19.518
DAVID:
Okay. Thanks a lot.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.429
KA_LINDA:
But if you go
after David Lee,

18:22.460 --> 18:24.724
you'd better win,
or it won't be pretty.

18:26.270 --> 18:27.589
BURL:
Hi.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.198
Hello.

18:29.240 --> 18:31.663
It's kind of nerve-racking
in here, isn't it?

18:31.710 --> 18:32.734
Everybody ducking and covering?

18:32.770 --> 18:34.306
_ Hmm_?
No, it seems fine to me.

18:34.340 --> 18:35.705
Really?

18:35.740 --> 18:37.446
Then you're made
of stronger stuff.

18:38.480 --> 18:39.504
You, uh...

18:39.550 --> 18:41.871
you know the penalty
for perjury, Mrs. Florrick?

18:41.920 --> 18:43.410
I do.

18:43.450 --> 18:44.610
What is it?

18:44.650 --> 18:47.414
Perjury is a class three felony
resulting in imprisonment

18:47.460 --> 18:49.587
for no less than two years
and no more than five.

18:49.620 --> 18:50.780
Good.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.286
Thank you.

18:52.330 --> 18:53.627
In what capacity

18:53.660 --> 18:56.527
did you assist David Lee
on the Huntley divorce?

18:56.560 --> 18:58.767
Under his supervision,
I helped negotiate

18:58.800 --> 19:01.564
the division of assets
and execute the paperwork.

19:01.600 --> 19:02.828
And what else?

19:02.870 --> 19:04.428
I'm not sure what you mean.

19:04.470 --> 19:06.904
Didn't you also function
as something of a hand-holder

19:06.940 --> 19:08.305
for my client?
No.

19:09.340 --> 19:10.602
You didn't?

19:10.650 --> 19:12.299
I didn't.

19:13.580 --> 19:15.775
Oh. I see.

19:15.820 --> 19:18.448
Let me try again.

19:18.490 --> 19:20.754
Did you function
as hand-holder to April Huntley,

19:20.790 --> 19:22.417
the wife of my client?

19:22.460 --> 19:23.950
I tried to comfort her. Yes.

19:23.990 --> 19:25.651
You told her
you had also

19:25.690 --> 19:28.158
dealt with an unfaithful spouse?

19:29.630 --> 19:31.325
We commiserated
over Similarities

19:31.370 --> 19:32.667
in our personal lives.

19:32.700 --> 19:34.531
Did you express
what a relief it was

19:34.570 --> 19:36.231
to be away
from a cheating husband,

19:36.270 --> 19:38.409
saying, "You can't
imagine the relief

19:38.440 --> 19:40.328
"you feel that
first night,

19:40.380 --> 19:43.440
just being alone,
having a glass of wine"?

19:43.480 --> 19:44.640
Objection, Mr. Preston.

19:44.680 --> 19:45.977
Are we really delving

19:46.010 --> 19:47.272
into Mrs. Florrick's
private life?

19:47.320 --> 19:48.514
Only as far
as Mrs. Florrick delved

19:48.550 --> 19:50.780
into it to further
the firm's interests.

19:50.820 --> 19:52.481
Did you exploit
your marital status

19:52.520 --> 19:53.817
to influence my client's wife?

19:53.860 --> 19:56.613
Mrs. Huntley asked me
about my own experiences,

19:56.660 --> 19:59.288
and I shared those
with her

19:59.330 --> 20:00.888
in an attempt to comfort.

20:00.930 --> 20:02.522
That is all.
To your knowledge,

20:02.560 --> 20:04.425
did David Lee
hire the stripper, Alexandria,

20:04.470 --> 20:05.767
to seduce my client?

20:05.800 --> 20:07.267
No.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.366
You're under oath,
Mrs. Florrick.

20:12.410 --> 20:15.436
Yes, I recognize that,
and my answer is still no.

20:16.840 --> 20:19.547
That seems to be your
case, Mr. Preston.

20:19.580 --> 20:20.672
Shall we
call it a day?

20:20.720 --> 20:22.938
Uh, just... just
one more thing.

20:22.980 --> 20:24.516
Mrs. Florrick,

20:24.550 --> 20:25.847
what is this?

20:25.890 --> 20:27.448
It appears
to be a contract

20:27.490 --> 20:28.752
for the sale
of Bubble Elastic.

20:28.790 --> 20:30.724
It is, in fact.

20:30.760 --> 20:31.920
Your law firm
negotiated that sale?

20:31.960 --> 20:33.450
We did.

20:33.500 --> 20:34.853
Mm-hmm.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.390
Do you see
that last line?

20:36.430 --> 20:38.921
What percentage did
your law firm negotiate

20:38.970 --> 20:41.336
for Bubble Elastic's
future profits?

20:41.370 --> 20:42.837
It says five,

20:42.870 --> 20:44.667
but I was not
involved in that.

20:44.710 --> 20:45.859
I know.

20:45.910 --> 20:47.537
But I thought
a third-year associate

20:47.580 --> 20:48.672
who perjured herself...

20:48.710 --> 20:49.836
DIANE:
Objection.

20:49.880 --> 20:51.677
BURL:
...would be the
best one to read

20:51.710 --> 20:52.847
about the demise
of Lockhart/Gardner.

20:52.880 --> 20:54.370
DIANE:
Is this a deposition

20:54.420 --> 20:55.375
or an attack?

20:55.420 --> 20:56.478
A little of
both, actually.

20:56.520 --> 21:00.752
That line there-- five percent--
means you made more

21:00.790 --> 21:02.712
from that company
than Mrs. Huntley.

21:02.760 --> 21:04.318
Does that sound fair,
Mrs. Florrick?

21:04.360 --> 21:05.918
It sounds like a judgment call.

21:05.960 --> 21:07.598
A legal judgment call.

21:07.630 --> 21:08.824
Ms. Lockhart is right.

21:08.860 --> 21:11.795
I may not have you on
alienation of affection,

21:11.830 --> 21:13.730
but I now have you on fraud.

21:13.770 --> 21:14.737
We're done here.
Thank you.

21:16.540 --> 21:17.837
Oh, no.

21:17.870 --> 21:20.259
We're just beginning.

21:26.010 --> 21:27.773
(overlapping chatter)
It was money.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.469
I was trying
to make the firm money.

21:29.520 --> 21:31.044
DAVID:
I'm not going to pay
for his mistake.

21:31.090 --> 21:33.650
Well, I'm not paying
for yours.
Okay, let's all raise hands,

21:33.690 --> 21:35.351
one at a time.
JULIUS:
I got a five
percent return

21:35.390 --> 21:36.755
on the company sale--
I can't help it

21:36.790 --> 21:38.348
if David Lee got
his client less.

21:38.390 --> 21:39.652
What? Are you kidding?

21:39.690 --> 21:40.850
JULIUS:
And now he's abdicating
responsibility.

21:40.900 --> 21:42.788
Your left hand does not know
what your right hand is doing.

21:42.830 --> 21:43.967
JULIUS:
Why am I being persecuted

21:44.000 --> 21:45.422
for doing my job?

21:45.470 --> 21:46.459
Because you didn't tell us,

21:46.500 --> 21:47.467
and now it's fraud,

21:47.500 --> 21:48.762
you stupid...

21:48.800 --> 21:49.732
Stupid what?

21:49.770 --> 21:53.001
Ooh. Come on, say it.
I didn't say anything.

21:53.040 --> 21:54.701
I wasn't going to say
anything, and I'm

21:54.740 --> 21:55.832
really offended
that you think I would say...

21:55.880 --> 21:57.074
Oh, are you offended, David?
DIANE: Thank you very much.

21:57.110 --> 21:58.179
Are you offended, David?
Thank you.

21:58.210 --> 22:01.543
Did the client sign
a conflict of interest waiver?

22:01.580 --> 22:03.445
That's right, she did.
It's standard for us.

22:03.490 --> 22:05.742
Good, we're protected. It can't
be fraud if she signed off

22:05.790 --> 22:07.348
on any potential
conflict of interest.

22:07.390 --> 22:08.755
Why don't I find
it in discovery?

22:08.790 --> 22:09.586
Because you're blind.

22:09.620 --> 22:10.928
It's there.
It's a standard rider.

22:10.960 --> 22:12.587
All right,
where, David?
It's a rider.

22:12.630 --> 22:14.723
If it's not with the hard copy,
it's in the database.

22:14.760 --> 22:15.920
DIANE:
I'll get Kalinda on it.
Diane.

22:17.430 --> 22:19.022
We need to talk.

22:19.070 --> 22:21.630
Clause 63.

22:21.670 --> 22:23.558
In a malpractice case,
the partners can vote

22:23.610 --> 22:25.828
to hold only
the negligent partner liable

22:25.870 --> 22:27.098
for the entirety of damages.

22:27.140 --> 22:30.701
We're not throwing anyone
under the bus, Eli.

22:30.750 --> 22:32.775
Last time I looked,
we're all under the bus.

22:32.810 --> 22:35.472
This was a clause
insisted on by David Lee.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.408
He was the one...
Who told you that?

22:37.450 --> 22:40.089
Who told me David Lee
insisted on it? Kalinda.

22:40.120 --> 22:42.759
He was afraid
to be at the mercy

22:42.790 --> 22:44.929
of other people's mistakes.
It seems only fitting...

22:44.960 --> 22:47.849
David Lee brought in 30% of
the firm's business this year.

22:50.500 --> 22:52.798
You are a profit
participant now, Eli.

22:52.830 --> 22:54.798
Throwing David Lee overboard
is shortsighted.

22:54.840 --> 22:57.536
It is reacting to
short-term circumstances

22:57.570 --> 22:59.663
with long-term measures,
and I won't do it.

22:59.710 --> 23:00.608
No, you won't do it.

23:00.640 --> 23:02.039
Because you have a failed
romantic notion

23:02.080 --> 23:03.843
that what you're running here
is a family.

23:03.880 --> 23:05.142
It's not a family, Diane.

23:05.180 --> 23:06.704
A family can't fire you.

23:06.750 --> 23:08.809
A family doesn't cost me
$1.2 million.

23:08.850 --> 23:09.771
We're not doing it, Eli.

23:09.820 --> 23:12.482
If David Lee came to me
wanting to dump you,

23:12.520 --> 23:15.011
I would have that same answer.

23:16.890 --> 23:19.051
I can outvote you.

23:19.090 --> 23:21.194
All I need is a majority
of the equity partners.

23:21.230 --> 23:24.097
Well, that's true.

23:24.130 --> 23:26.769
Too bad you haven't been
fostering relationships.

23:26.800 --> 23:28.097
(chuckles)

23:31.540 --> 23:33.531
No time like the present.

23:36.610 --> 23:38.100
(sighs)

23:51.090 --> 23:52.751
ELSBETH:
Oh, sorry.

23:52.790 --> 23:54.223
They're painting.

23:54.260 --> 23:56.728
They keep trying to
improve my office--

23:56.760 --> 23:59.194
Oh, no, wait, wait,
wait! (gasps)

23:59.230 --> 24:00.868
Oh, no.

24:00.900 --> 24:02.128
That's okay.

24:02.170 --> 24:06.129
The painters are
practical jokers.

24:06.170 --> 24:09.003
(clears throat)

24:09.040 --> 24:11.873
Thanks for meeting
me, Ms. Tascioni.

24:11.910 --> 24:14.674
I've met a lot of lawyers, but
Mrs. Florrick swears by you.

24:14.720 --> 24:15.675
Oh. Well...

24:15.720 --> 24:18.086
(chuckles)
she's very nice.

24:18.120 --> 24:21.214
So, they're accusing you
of bribing judges?

24:21.260 --> 24:23.649
The state's attorney's
office, yes.

24:23.690 --> 24:25.658
But they're not saying
whiclhl ones?
0.

24:25.690 --> 24:27.692
(phone ringing in distance)

24:31.670 --> 24:33.126
Do you hear that?

24:33.170 --> 24:34.137
Yes.

24:36.170 --> 24:38.502
Fantasia, someone's calling!

24:38.540 --> 24:39.859
(ringing continues)

24:39.910 --> 24:41.036
Fantasia!

24:41.080 --> 24:42.206
Why don't I come
back another time?

24:42.240 --> 24:43.207
No, no.
This'll just take...

24:43.240 --> 24:45.049
(grunting)

24:45.080 --> 24:46.570
Uh, call back!

24:46.610 --> 24:48.168
If you can hear me, call back!

24:48.220 --> 24:50.040
You know, let me
arrange another time

24:50.080 --> 24:51.889
for us to meet.
No, no.

24:51.920 --> 24:54.081
Mr. Gardner, who are
the three most honest judges

24:54.120 --> 24:55.155
in Cook County?

24:55.190 --> 24:57.215
The three most honest?

24:57.260 --> 24:58.625
I don't know.

24:58.660 --> 25:00.821
Howard, Spinelli,

25:00.860 --> 25:01.929
Kotter. Why?

25:01.960 --> 25:05.123
And you're just waiting around
for a grand jury, right?

25:05.170 --> 25:07.593
Yes.

25:07.640 --> 25:09.232
That's a mistake.

25:09.270 --> 25:12.068
You have to apply pressure
to the special prosecutor.

25:12.110 --> 25:13.202
How do I do that?

25:13.240 --> 25:14.901
No, you don't do anything.
I do that.

25:14.940 --> 25:16.202
And how do you do that?

25:16.240 --> 25:17.605
I have no idea.

25:17.650 --> 25:20.642
But... I'm just starting.

25:29.160 --> 25:31.651
Okay?

25:31.690 --> 25:33.157
Okay.

25:33.190 --> 25:34.157
Okay.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.599
(phone ringing, Elsbeth gasps)

25:35.630 --> 25:38.190
I think that's
a different one.

25:38.230 --> 25:39.595
Fantasia!

25:39.630 --> 25:40.892
If it's logged in,
it's logged in.

25:40.940 --> 25:42.032
Yeah, but I checked

25:42.070 --> 25:43.935
the database.
The contract's on there,

25:43.970 --> 25:45.938
but there's one page
missing: the rider.
It's one page.

25:45.970 --> 25:46.834
So what?

25:46.870 --> 25:48.269
$44 million depends
on that one page.

25:48.310 --> 25:49.277
Well, here's a suggestion.

25:49.310 --> 25:50.504
Maybe it doesn't exist.

25:50.540 --> 25:53.100
Whoever logged it in messed up,
never got the rider signed.

25:53.150 --> 25:54.242
Well, can you find out
who logged it in?

25:54.280 --> 25:56.976
(sighs)

25:57.020 --> 25:59.181
If they log it in,
it's in my database.

25:59.220 --> 26:01.859
Computers don't make things up,
people make things up.

26:01.890 --> 26:03.619
There.
That's who logged it in.

26:03.660 --> 26:05.082
That's who made the mistake,

26:05.130 --> 26:07.121
not me.

26:11.800 --> 26:13.267
KALINDA:
Hi.

26:13.300 --> 26:14.597
(door closes)
Hi.

26:14.640 --> 26:16.039
Is something wrong?

26:16.070 --> 26:19.062
Uh, the Huntleys-- that
was your first divorce?

26:19.110 --> 26:21.078
Second.
And you were at the
firm for how long?

26:21.110 --> 26:23.135
A half a year. Why?

26:23.180 --> 26:25.603
You supervised the
signing of the contract?

26:25.650 --> 26:26.742
Yes.

26:26.780 --> 26:28.042
What's wrong?

26:28.080 --> 26:32.039
I'm finding some difficulties
in the filing.

26:32.090 --> 26:33.216
There was no rider.

26:35.260 --> 26:37.182
In the hard copy, I know.

26:37.220 --> 26:38.380
You have to check the database.

26:38.430 --> 26:39.385
I did.

26:39.430 --> 26:41.057
I can't find it there, either.

26:41.100 --> 26:43.318
There was a rider.

26:43.360 --> 26:45.123
You sure?

26:45.170 --> 26:47.661
I saw her sign it.

26:47.700 --> 26:49.292
I was there when she signed it.

26:49.340 --> 26:50.807
I had to sign it, too.

26:53.840 --> 26:56.274
Oh, my God.

26:56.310 --> 26:57.948
Are you sure?

26:59.980 --> 27:02.676
This whole lawsuit
depends on that rider.

27:02.720 --> 27:04.813
Look, it was
your first year here.

27:04.850 --> 27:06.147
Is there any chance
you could've...
No.

27:06.190 --> 27:07.885
No, I mean, is there any chance

27:07.920 --> 27:09.717
you could've filed it
somewhere else?

27:09.760 --> 27:12.228
I don't think so, no.

27:12.260 --> 27:14.649
I have to tell Diane.

27:14.700 --> 27:16.156
_DIANE:
Wait a minute.

27:16.200 --> 27:17.758
I'm in the lobby, Alicia.

27:17.800 --> 27:18.994
I can't hear.

27:19.030 --> 27:20.361
I'm on my way up.

27:22.370 --> 27:23.234
Well, look who's here.

27:23.270 --> 27:24.237
Yep.

27:24.270 --> 27:25.305
Hi.
Mr. Copeland,

27:25.340 --> 27:27.900
thank you for the poster,
but the answer is no.

27:27.940 --> 27:29.430
I'm_not interested
in havmg...

27:29.480 --> 27:31.345
Would you excuse me?
Just for a second.

27:31.380 --> 27:32.369
Mr. Dobbs?

27:32.410 --> 27:33.911
Hello.

27:33.950 --> 27:35.372
Apologies.

27:35.420 --> 27:36.739
That's not me.

27:36.780 --> 27:38.179
The summons is
delivered, Sir, when...

27:39.090 --> 27:41.081
(grunting)

27:41.120 --> 27:43.259
The summons is accepted
when you acknowledge your name.

27:43.290 --> 27:44.325
Do you understand?

27:44.360 --> 27:46.225
Please, stop struggling.

27:46.260 --> 27:49.354
I'll let you go, Mr. Dobbs,
if you promise not to fight.

27:49.400 --> 27:51.891
Now, do you promise
not to fight?

27:51.930 --> 27:53.067
(grunting)

27:53.100 --> 27:54.260
Yes.

27:56.040 --> 27:56.893
(panﬁng)

27:56.940 --> 27:58.032
Just take a few breaths.

27:58.070 --> 27:59.037
You'll be fine.

27:59.070 --> 28:00.207
I'll sue your ass!

28:00.240 --> 28:01.901
That's your first impulse,

28:01.940 --> 28:05.068
but I've documented everything,
and we got witnesses.

28:05.110 --> 28:07.249
You have been served,
Mr. Dobbs.

28:07.280 --> 28:09.373
You were saying?

28:09.420 --> 28:12.344
That happens all the time?

28:12.390 --> 28:13.857
No, no.

28:13.890 --> 28:15.016
Sometimes.

28:15.060 --> 28:16.459
Most people are
pretty good about it.

28:16.490 --> 28:19.357
I wasn't here to see you.

28:19.390 --> 28:21.324
It was the same building;
I serve this district.

28:21.360 --> 28:22.952
Oh, I see.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.160
(laughs)

28:24.200 --> 28:26.293
Well, I... I
misunderstood.

28:26.330 --> 28:28.366
It was very nice
to see you again.

28:28.400 --> 28:30.368
Very nice to see you.

28:34.210 --> 28:36.098
What happened?

28:36.140 --> 28:37.971
We can't find the rider.

28:39.510 --> 28:41.171
I filed it,
but we can't find it.

28:41.220 --> 28:42.175
DAVID:
The rider was signed.

28:42.220 --> 28:43.312
I was supervising Alicia;

28:43.350 --> 28:44.442
I know it was signed.
Then where is it?

28:44.490 --> 28:46.344
Would you stop
cheering for disaster?

28:46.390 --> 28:47.812
I'm not cheering for anything.

28:47.860 --> 28:49.487
This is an I.T. problem.
DIANE:
No, it's not.

28:49.520 --> 28:51.249
It's all our problem.

28:51.290 --> 28:52.951
I'm sorry.

28:52.990 --> 28:54.150
I know I logged it.

28:54.200 --> 28:56.122
It was your first year,
Alicia.

28:56.160 --> 28:57.195
Are you sure?

28:57.230 --> 28:59.221
Yes.

29:01.200 --> 29:03.191
Thank you, Alicia.

29:06.440 --> 29:08.271
(door closes)

29:19.820 --> 29:21.310
So, Clause 63?

29:21.360 --> 29:23.248
Yeah.

29:23.290 --> 29:25.258
Clause 63.

29:25.290 --> 29:29.090
People have come after me--
random people, here and there--

29:29.130 --> 29:32.861
but you're the first
to do it so baldly.

29:32.900 --> 29:34.060
Nice office.

29:34.100 --> 29:35.294
Thank you.
A lot of
square footage.

29:35.340 --> 29:37.092
I don't keep track.

29:37.140 --> 29:40.268
How much are you
bringing in each year?

29:40.310 --> 29:42.198
I haven't been here
long enough to judge.

29:42.240 --> 29:45.346
Yet you feel comfortable enough
to try to get me dumped.

29:45.380 --> 29:47.348
Yeah, I guess I do.

29:47.380 --> 29:49.177
Is this a get-to-know-
each-other session

29:49.220 --> 29:51.188
or are we confronting
each other?

29:51.220 --> 29:52.346
You are gone.

29:52.390 --> 29:55.416
You are so gone you might
as well clean out your desk.

29:55.460 --> 29:56.415
Really?

29:56.460 --> 29:58.018
Uh, why is that?

29:58.060 --> 29:59.357
Because I will
in5ist on it.

29:59.390 --> 30:00.379
(chuckles)

30:00.430 --> 30:02.318
Oh, no. Mmm.

30:02.360 --> 30:03.327
I'm sorry.

30:03.360 --> 30:04.463
You don't Clause 63 me.

30:04.500 --> 30:06.320
I Clause 63 you.

30:06.370 --> 30:08.531
Yeah, that might've worked
at another time,

30:08.570 --> 30:11.004
but you screwed up, buddy.

30:11.040 --> 30:13.361
And people who screw up
can't act like they didn't.

30:13.410 --> 30:15.230
They have to act contrite.

30:15.280 --> 30:18.249
And just so you know,
contrite is not this.

30:20.410 --> 30:22.241
Okay.

30:22.280 --> 30:23.838
This was fun.

30:23.890 --> 30:25.414
Just so you know,

30:25.450 --> 30:28.453
I was going to leave.

30:28.490 --> 30:30.355
I had plans to leave.

30:30.390 --> 30:32.858
But now you made
it worth my while.

30:32.890 --> 30:34.391
(chuckles softly)

30:34.430 --> 30:36.898
Nice to meet you.

30:36.930 --> 30:38.591
Buddy.

30:41.040 --> 30:42.393
(knocks)

30:42.440 --> 30:43.998
Do you have a moment?

30:44.040 --> 30:45.462
Sure.

30:45.510 --> 30:48.479
Diane has asked me to get your
best memory of what happened.

30:48.510 --> 30:51.570
Sure. Let's go for it.

30:51.610 --> 30:53.498
Okay.

30:53.550 --> 30:56.974
Do you remember what time of day
the contract was signed?

30:57.020 --> 31:00.012
After refreshing my memory
with my day planner.

31:00.050 --> 31:01.551
It was signed
at 11:00 am.

31:01.590 --> 31:04.058
I'm sorry, um,
I have to ask you this,

31:04.090 --> 31:05.455
but where did you go afterward?

31:05.490 --> 31:09.153
According to my day planner,
I had a function at school.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.929
Grace's school,
an assembly.

31:10.970 --> 31:12.323
And before you left,
you filed the contract?

31:12.370 --> 31:13.325
Yes.

31:13.370 --> 31:15.258
Mrs. Huntley
and her lawyer

31:15.300 --> 31:17.268
r_etained two exe_cuted
copies and we retained one.

31:17.300 --> 31:19.507
Which you filed?

31:19.540 --> 31:21.007
Yes.

31:21.040 --> 31:21.972
In the active drawer.

31:22.010 --> 31:24.205
And you made the photocopy
or did a paralegal?

31:24.250 --> 31:25.148
I did.

31:25.180 --> 31:26.647
And I personally filed
it in the archive.

31:26.680 --> 31:28.648
And the rider was separate?

31:35.360 --> 31:37.112
I don't remember.

31:37.160 --> 31:41.654
Do you remember having to attach
the rider to the contract?

31:43.660 --> 31:45.366
No.

31:45.400 --> 31:48.494
You don't remember?

31:48.540 --> 31:50.235
I don't remember.

31:50.270 --> 31:51.999
Do you remember
signing the rider, also?

31:52.040 --> 31:55.339
You had to sign it to act
as a witness to her signature.

31:58.180 --> 32:00.148
I'm gonna write that down
as a "yes."

32:00.180 --> 32:01.442
I don't remember.

32:01.480 --> 32:03.118
I'm gonna write that down
as a "yes."
No.

32:03.150 --> 32:04.117
I don't remember.

32:04.150 --> 32:07.278
Alicia Florrick.

32:07.320 --> 32:09.208
Yes?

32:09.260 --> 32:11.228
We found the rider.

32:11.260 --> 32:13.228
(sighs)

32:13.260 --> 32:15.228
(panting):
Where? Oh.

32:15.260 --> 32:16.397
Cary's files.

32:16.430 --> 32:18.569
They had been moved into storage
when we did the expansion.

32:18.600 --> 32:21.068
We found a hard copy.

32:23.100 --> 32:25.568
(sighs)

32:25.610 --> 32:26.702
DIANE:
We have it.

32:26.740 --> 32:29.538
We're good,
we're good.

32:29.580 --> 32:31.241
We're okay.

32:31.280 --> 32:32.542
You must've been
killing yourself.

32:32.580 --> 32:34.411
ALICIA:
Yes. Thanks.
(laughter)

32:34.450 --> 32:36.247
So I'll get on the
phone with Mr. Preston.

32:36.280 --> 32:38.612
Why should we delay
the good news from him?

32:38.650 --> 32:40.618
Oh, there it is.

32:40.650 --> 32:43.210
The rider, April
Huntley's signature,

32:43.260 --> 32:45.387
and there's your
confirming signature.

32:45.430 --> 32:46.385
Mmm.

32:46.430 --> 32:49.092
(sighs)

32:49.130 --> 32:51.519
DIANE:
Well, David,
we dodged the bullet.

32:51.570 --> 32:53.697
DAVID:
Yes, we did.

32:53.730 --> 32:56.631
DIANE (laughs):
Oh, I can't wait
to see his face.

32:56.670 --> 32:59.366
(David and Diane laughing)

33:17.790 --> 33:20.520
But... you're not sure?

33:20.560 --> 33:22.528
Am I sure that

33:22.560 --> 33:26.724
this rider is something
David Lee slipped to me to sign?

33:26.770 --> 33:28.738
No.

33:28.770 --> 33:30.635
Ijust...

33:31.810 --> 33:34.529
I think there were six
pages in my children's

33:34.580 --> 33:36.605
trust that I signed,
and now there are five.

33:36.640 --> 33:38.779
But you're not certain?

33:39.810 --> 33:41.710
100% certain?

33:41.750 --> 33:43.718
No.

33:43.750 --> 33:47.584
Then I think you have to commit
to your best memory of events.

33:47.620 --> 33:49.679
I don't understand.

33:49.720 --> 33:52.723
You remember seeing this rider
being signed two years ago?

33:52.760 --> 33:53.727
Yes.

33:53.760 --> 33:55.489
You're sure
of that?
Yes.

33:55.530 --> 33:56.724
And you're not sure whether

33:56.760 --> 33:59.126
this rider page is different?

33:59.170 --> 34:00.398
That's correct.

34:00.430 --> 34:02.569
Testimony is about
your best memory.

34:02.600 --> 34:04.761
You go
with your best memory.

34:04.810 --> 34:06.607
What if it's wrong?

34:06.640 --> 34:08.801
Testimony isn't about
right or wrong, Alicia.

34:08.840 --> 34:11.343
It's about the facts
as established

34:11.380 --> 34:12.802
by your best memory
of events.

34:12.850 --> 34:14.738
Your memory is this.

34:14.780 --> 34:16.714
You saw the rider
being signed.

34:16.750 --> 34:18.411
Then that's the fact.

34:18.450 --> 34:21.510
It's not up to me
to do my opponent's job for him.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.858
It's up to Mr. Preston
to poke holes in your testimony.

34:23.890 --> 34:26.586
You do not poke holes
in your own.

34:26.630 --> 34:27.779
Do you understand?

34:28.830 --> 34:30.821
I do.

34:30.860 --> 34:33.067
Thank you.

34:35.440 --> 34:37.465
(sighs)

34:37.500 --> 34:38.728
(door opens)

34:38.770 --> 34:41.671
(door closes)

34:41.710 --> 34:44.406
WENDY:
Okay, now, point this
down and don't run.

34:44.450 --> 34:46.475
Okay? He's right
over there.

34:46.510 --> 34:49.149
(laughs)

34:49.180 --> 34:50.716
Hello.

34:50.750 --> 34:52.638
Hello.

34:52.690 --> 34:54.510
I heard this play
was really good.

34:54.560 --> 34:55.709
I like anything
with bears.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.352
(laughs)
Yes.

34:57.390 --> 34:59.529
You're Wendy Scott-Carr?

34:59.560 --> 35:00.754
Iam.

35:00.790 --> 35:02.621
Do you work at the state's

35:02.660 --> 35:04.161
attorney's office?
No. (groans)

35:04.200 --> 35:06.464
No. I'm a lawyer
representing Will Gardner.

35:06.500 --> 35:07.694
Elsbeth Tascioni.

35:07.730 --> 35:09.493
(laughs)

35:09.540 --> 35:10.734
I see.

35:10.770 --> 35:12.169
He hired a lavwer?

35:12.210 --> 35:13.336
What? Yes.

35:13.370 --> 35:14.769
(both laugh)

35:14.810 --> 35:17.199
Although, um, we haven't
worked out all the details yet.

35:17.240 --> 35:19.572
But I know that you
met with my client,

35:19.610 --> 35:21.771
and I don't think you
should do that again

35:21.820 --> 35:23.776
without me being
there, okay?

35:23.820 --> 35:26.243
If that's what you'd like.
It is. If you don't mind?

35:26.290 --> 35:27.712
Wow. Let me see.

35:27.750 --> 35:29.809
Oh, he even
put your names in it.

35:29.860 --> 35:31.259
Why don't you go see

35:31.290 --> 35:33.656
if you can get one
from the lion, too, okay?

35:33.690 --> 35:34.827
Oh!
Go ahead.

35:34.860 --> 35:35.895
Say "hi" for me.

35:35.930 --> 35:37.795
Your client bribed _ _
several judges, Ms. TaSCIOnl.

35:37.830 --> 35:40.469
Yes, well, funny you
should bring that up.

35:40.500 --> 35:43.833
A reporter called me today
from the Chicago Tribune.

35:43.870 --> 35:45.701
Very nice man.

35:45.740 --> 35:47.867
And, um, he asked me
about these three judges

35:47.910 --> 35:49.605
that Mr. Gardner
supposedly bribed...

35:49.640 --> 35:51.574
I didn't say anything
to the press.

35:51.610 --> 35:53.703
No, I know. I didn't
think you did.

35:53.750 --> 35:54.717
Anyway, he asked me

35:54.750 --> 35:58.208
if they were in fact Howard,
Spinelli and Kotter.

35:58.250 --> 35:59.717
And I said I
didn't know.

35:59.750 --> 36:01.752
I'm not investigating them.

36:01.790 --> 36:03.587
I know, I thought
probably not.

36:03.620 --> 36:05.429
Because, as I said
to this reporter,

36:05.460 --> 36:07.451
those are three
of the most honest

36:07.490 --> 36:09.799
and beloved judges on the
bench, and, you know,

36:09.830 --> 36:11.764
that would put you in a
very difficult position

36:11.800 --> 36:16.897
at the courthouse, with all
those judges very angry...

36:16.940 --> 36:18.430
at you.
You leaked those names?

36:18.470 --> 36:20.904
(laughs)

36:20.940 --> 36:22.771
I can bring obstruction
of justice charges

36:22.810 --> 36:23.708
against you right now.

36:23.740 --> 36:25.901
Yes, unfortunately,
you'll need a judge

36:25.950 --> 36:29.408
to sanction any such charge,
and I think you'll find

36:29.450 --> 36:32.749
those judges in an
uncooperative mood right now.

36:32.790 --> 36:34.587
(laughs)
Here we are.

36:34.620 --> 36:37.612
Your client better
get ready for an indictment.

36:37.660 --> 36:39.582
Um, no, he doesn't need
to be ready,

36:39.630 --> 36:40.881
because you know, I am.

36:40.930 --> 36:41.954
Then I'm sure
we'll meet again.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.695
Oh, I can't wait.

36:43.730 --> 36:45.618
Oh, hey!

36:45.670 --> 36:46.967
BURL:
This is absurd.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.888
Pardon?
Do you expect
me to believe

36:48.940 --> 36:51.465
this critical
document surfaced at

36:51.510 --> 36:52.909
precisely the
right time?
DAVID:
What are you suggesting?

36:52.940 --> 36:54.407
That it's a forgery?
I am.

36:54.440 --> 36:55.509
Then I'm offended.

36:55.540 --> 36:57.633
Then we'd like

36:57.680 --> 36:59.648
to re-depose
the parties involved

36:59.680 --> 37:02.012
to vouch for_ the
document's legitimacy.

37:02.050 --> 37:03.847
And another first-year associate

37:03.880 --> 37:06.485
who worked on the divorce
we've yet to depose--

37:06.520 --> 37:08.215
Cary Agos.

37:09.060 --> 37:11.255
Certainly.

37:11.290 --> 37:13.850
Why don't we arrange
a time tomorrow?

37:17.060 --> 37:19.267
(elevator bell dings)

37:28.910 --> 37:30.878
Hey.

37:30.910 --> 37:32.275
Hi.

37:32.310 --> 37:34.540
Working late?
No.

37:34.580 --> 37:36.571
You're not?
Nope.

37:36.620 --> 37:38.417
Well, then,
what are you doing here?

37:38.450 --> 37:41.351
There's something I thought
might help you with your, um...

37:41.390 --> 37:43.415
summons.

37:43.460 --> 37:45.428
My summons?

37:45.460 --> 37:47.621
Yes, your lawsuit.

37:47.660 --> 37:49.491
Mr. Huntley had to sign off

37:49.530 --> 37:51.896
on the summons before
I delivered them.
Yes?

37:51.930 --> 37:54.433
And he wasn't
at his wife's apartment.

37:54.470 --> 37:56.495
Really?

38:02.610 --> 38:04.601
BURL:
Do you recognize this document?

38:08.780 --> 38:10.042
No.

38:10.080 --> 38:11.980
BURL:
You've never seen it before?
CARY: No.

38:12.020 --> 38:14.454
Thank you.

38:14.490 --> 38:18.483
You worked on this divorce case
alongside Alicia Florrick

38:18.530 --> 38:20.589
and under the supervision
of David Lee?

38:20.630 --> 38:22.450
Yes.

38:22.500 --> 38:25.594
So, you were in a perfect
position to see such a document?

38:25.630 --> 38:27.393
Not necessarily.

38:30.070 --> 38:31.765
But you worked closely
on this case?

38:31.810 --> 38:33.732
Yes, but that doesn't
mean anything.

38:33.770 --> 38:35.533
It's been two years.

38:35.580 --> 38:37.536
I couldn't tell you a single
document that's in that file,

38:37.580 --> 38:39.605
to be honest.

38:39.650 --> 38:41.709
Do you have any idea
how a document

38:41.750 --> 38:43.843
signed by Alicia Florrick
got into your files

38:43.880 --> 38:45.381
in the first place?

38:45.420 --> 38:46.648
Sure. We shared an assistant.

38:46.690 --> 38:47.918
Things got mixed up sometimes.

38:50.420 --> 38:52.388
BURL:
Ah.

38:52.430 --> 38:54.022
You were fired
from this firm,

38:54.060 --> 38:55.459
is that right?

38:55.500 --> 38:56.751
CARY:
Yes.

38:56.800 --> 38:59.394
So your testimony
may be influenced

38:59.430 --> 39:01.990
by the fact
that you want your job back?

39:04.040 --> 39:05.860
I can see that you got a yarn
you want to spin,

39:05.910 --> 39:07.730
Mr. Preston, so let
me just go ahead

39:07.770 --> 39:09.374
and lay this out
clearly for you.

39:09.410 --> 39:10.775
I have absolutely no reason

39:10.810 --> 39:12.869
to believe
that document is a forgery.

39:12.910 --> 39:15.674
I knew Mrs. Florrick
and Mr. Lee to be outstanding,

39:15.720 --> 39:17.972
competent and ethical attorneys
throughout my time at the firm.

39:18.020 --> 39:19.146
And as for me,

39:19.190 --> 39:21.078
I have no vested interest
in the outcome of this case.

39:21.120 --> 39:22.712
I don't work here,
and I don't intend to.

39:24.860 --> 39:27.829
Any additional questions?

39:31.900 --> 39:33.868
Thank you.

39:33.900 --> 39:35.936
You're welcome.

39:37.840 --> 39:40.434
I... I don't get it.

39:40.470 --> 39:41.903
(laughs quietly)

39:41.940 --> 39:43.498
Oh, wow.

39:43.540 --> 39:45.940
What's so funny?

39:46.950 --> 39:48.008
(elevator bell dings)

39:48.050 --> 39:50.371
Things change.

39:52.450 --> 39:54.452
They do.

39:58.020 --> 39:59.988
I like working
with your husband.

40:00.030 --> 40:02.419
He likes working with you.

40:05.870 --> 40:07.690
DIANE:
Given that

40:07.730 --> 40:08.867
you've been unable
to establish

40:08.900 --> 40:11.061
that the waiver is anything
but perfectly legitimate,

40:11.100 --> 40:12.636
you are not left
with much of a case.

40:12.670 --> 40:13.739
BURL:
We disagree.

40:13.770 --> 40:16.933
We intend to obtain
a forensic analysis of the ink

40:16.980 --> 40:18.470
on the document
to determine

40:18.510 --> 40:20.603
whether it's actually
two years or two days old.

40:20.650 --> 40:21.776
That's ambitious.

40:21.820 --> 40:23.447
And will run you
about $30,000.

40:23.480 --> 40:25.641
DIANE:
So we would offer
that same $30,000

40:25.690 --> 40:27.715
as a, um, goodwill gesture.

40:27.750 --> 40:28.887
Absolutely not.

40:28.920 --> 40:32.959
Well, then...
this is our final offer.

40:48.240 --> 40:50.606
Okay, those are fake.
DAVID:
You'll probably

40:50.640 --> 40:51.846
have to do better than that.

40:51.880 --> 40:53.541
They were probably taken
when we were split up.

40:53.580 --> 40:55.013
I bought you that
shirt last week.
Okay, hon,

40:55.050 --> 40:55.869
just stay calm.

40:55.920 --> 40:57.672
You disgusting,
shameless piece of...

40:57.720 --> 40:58.982
Let's just take
a breath... April.

40:59.020 --> 41:01.045
No. I'm done.
Honey?

41:01.090 --> 41:02.182
April, please. Please.
JAKE:
Please, honey.

41:02.220 --> 41:04.984
(multiple phones ringing)
It's not true, Your Honor.

41:05.030 --> 41:07.123
Yes, there is an investigation,
but the article

41:07.160 --> 41:09.128
as reported is not true.

41:09.160 --> 41:11.151
His Honor Kotter.

41:11.200 --> 41:14.067
Your Honor, I have a judge
on the other line.

41:14.100 --> 41:15.067
(phones ringing)

41:15.100 --> 41:17.637
No, no, I'll-I'll call you back.

41:17.670 --> 41:19.558
Judge Howard
is in the waiting room.

41:19.610 --> 41:21.202
(sighs)

41:21.240 --> 41:23.777
We have to take the fight back
to her.

41:23.810 --> 41:26.244
Back to...?

41:26.280 --> 41:27.941
(sighs)

41:27.980 --> 41:29.516
We have to indict Will Gardner.

41:29.550 --> 41:31.177
ELI:
He is a liability, Diane.

41:31.220 --> 41:32.983
And, frankly, you're better off
without him.
Thursday would be
just fine for me.

41:33.020 --> 41:34.715
All I really need
is two weeks.

41:34.760 --> 41:36.079
DIANE:
Stop it,
both of you!

41:36.120 --> 41:37.018
Stop what? I'm
not bluffing.

41:37.060 --> 41:39.028
You work at opposite ends
of the building.

41:39.060 --> 41:41.221
You barely see each other.

41:41.260 --> 41:42.921
It's not about
seeing each other.

41:42.960 --> 41:45.099
It's about his methods
costing me $1.2 million.

41:45.130 --> 41:46.119
If you'd like me
to go somewhere else,

41:46.170 --> 41:47.296
Diane, just say the word.

41:47.330 --> 41:48.319
No, David.

41:48.370 --> 41:50.565
You will stay here
because we leave you alone.

41:50.600 --> 41:52.158
DAVID:
Somewhere else will
leave me just as alone.

41:52.210 --> 41:53.529
No, they won't.

41:53.570 --> 41:55.629
Not the way we will,
and you know it.

41:55.680 --> 41:57.568
It's a new economy.
People have to divorce.

41:57.610 --> 41:59.874
This lawsuit cost you.
That is a simple fact.

41:59.910 --> 42:02.071
Everybody knows
you're a risk,

42:02.120 --> 42:04.543
so stop threatening.

42:04.590 --> 42:06.649
And, Eli, you're staying

42:06.690 --> 42:09.011
because this job
is a temporary one for you

42:09.060 --> 42:09.958
until the governor's campaign.

42:09.990 --> 42:11.309
Tell me I'm wrong.

42:11.360 --> 42:14.750
Good. This is an
office of expediency.

42:14.800 --> 42:16.153
That is its strength.

42:16.200 --> 42:19.089
So stop bickering...

42:19.130 --> 42:20.722
and stop pretending
like you'll leave.

42:20.770 --> 42:22.169
I won't have it.

42:25.310 --> 42:27.699
I'm going
back to work.

42:27.740 --> 42:29.708
Good.

42:29.740 --> 42:31.037
(cl
oor open
Eli? S)

42:40.220 --> 42:41.312
(door opens)

42:41.350 --> 42:43.557
(sighs):
Oh.

42:49.030 --> 42:50.998
You're back?

42:51.030 --> 42:52.998
Hi.

42:53.030 --> 42:54.292
How are you?

42:54.330 --> 42:56.992
I'm fine. How are you?

42:57.040 --> 42:58.166
Fine.

42:58.200 --> 43:01.067
Well, then, we're both fine.

43:01.110 --> 43:02.907
I have to apologize again.

43:02.940 --> 43:04.908
I requested this job

43:04.950 --> 43:06.008
so I'd see
you again.

43:06.050 --> 43:07.802
Uh-oh.

43:07.850 --> 43:09.044
Why is that?

43:09.080 --> 43:12.618
Mr. Gardner?
You have been served.
