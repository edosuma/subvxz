00:03.100 --> 00:06.000
# You woke up
this morning #

00:06.035 --> 00:08.465
# Got yourself a gun #

00:08.500 --> 00:13.600
# Your momma always said
you'd be the Chosen One #

00:13.700 --> 00:16.000
# She said you're...
you're one in a million #

00:16.100 --> 00:18.300
# You've got
to burn to shine #

00:18.400 --> 00:21.300
# But you were
born under a bad sign #

00:21.400 --> 00:24.100
# With a blue moon
in your eyes #

00:24.200 --> 00:27.000
# When you
woke up this morning #

00:27.035 --> 00:29.800
# And all that love
had gone #

00:29.900 --> 00:33.000
# Your papa never
told you about #

00:33.035 --> 00:35.465
# Right and wrong #

00:35.500 --> 00:37.800
# But you're...
you're lookin' good, baby #

00:37.900 --> 00:40.200
# I believe that
you're feelin' fine #

00:40.300 --> 00:42.900
# Shame about it,
born under a bad sign #

00:42.935 --> 00:45.365
# With a blue moon
in your eyes #

00:45.400 --> 00:48.665
- # So sing it now #
- # Woke up this morning #

00:48.700 --> 00:52.300
# Got a blue moon...
got a blue moon in your eyes, yeah #

00:52.335 --> 00:54.300
# Woke up this morning #

00:56.300 --> 00:59.050
# You say you woke up
this morning #

00:59.085 --> 01:01.765
# The world
turned upside down #

01:01.800 --> 01:04.000
# Lordy, well,
things ain't been the same #

01:04.035 --> 01:07.300
# Since the blues
walked in our town #

01:07.400 --> 01:09.700
# But you're... but you're
one in a million #

01:09.800 --> 01:12.500
# 'Cause you got that
shotgun shine #

01:12.535 --> 01:15.200
# Shame about it,
born under a bad sign #

01:15.300 --> 01:18.200
# With a blue moon
in your eyes, yeah #

01:18.300 --> 01:21.200
# Woke up
this morning #

01:21.300 --> 01:24.400
- # Uh-huh #
- # And got yourself a gun #

01:24.500 --> 01:27.400
- # Woke up this morning #
- # Got yourself a gun #

01:27.500 --> 01:30.000

01:57.900 --> 02:00.250
# I was all right #

02:00.285 --> 02:02.565
# For a while #

02:02.600 --> 02:05.200
# I could smile... #

02:05.235 --> 02:06.265
There he is.

02:06.300 --> 02:08.500
Black Jack Massarone.

02:09.500 --> 02:12.400
I saw this
and I thought of you.

02:16.100 --> 02:18.565
- Ho, look at that!
- Guy's local.

02:18.600 --> 02:21.900
He makes them as part of a program
for disabled vets.

02:26.100 --> 02:27.800
A little gift
to show my gratitude

02:27.900 --> 02:30.300
for all our work
together.

02:30.335 --> 02:32.700
Thanks.

02:34.600 --> 02:36.900
- Look at those guys, huh?
- Mmm.

02:36.935 --> 02:39.700
They had some times, huh?

02:41.000 --> 02:43.100
You know we're finally
gonna cut the ribbon

02:43.200 --> 02:44.700
for the museum
on the 22nd.

02:44.800 --> 02:46.800
They're gonna ask me to make
a little speech

02:46.900 --> 02:50.400
on the challenges of contemporary
urban development.

02:50.435 --> 02:52.065
Thank you.

02:52.100 --> 02:54.500
- Somethin' for you?
- Oh, um...

02:54.600 --> 02:57.100
I'll have what
he's having.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.100
Listen, my buddy
in city plan check

03:03.200 --> 03:04.600
says he just pulled
a permit

03:04.700 --> 03:07.165
to turn the old bus station
into a mixed use.

03:07.200 --> 03:09.700
The thing is, Zellman still hasn't
given me a number.

03:09.800 --> 03:12.300
Has he said anything
to you about another bid?

03:12.335 --> 03:14.667
Oh, we don't
talk much.

03:14.702 --> 03:16.965
Take your hat off.
Relax.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.800
Yeah, I just started
on the Rogaine.

03:22.700 --> 03:25.150
Listen, you think maybe
you could ask Ron

03:25.185 --> 03:27.600
if this falls under
the same arrangement?

03:27.700 --> 03:30.700
Kinda soggy, you
wanna know the truth.

03:30.800 --> 03:32.600
Tony, this is federal
redevelopment.

03:32.700 --> 03:35.500
I'll look into it.

03:39.600 --> 03:41.765
- So, a speech, huh?
- Yeah.

03:41.800 --> 03:44.600
The Museum of Science
and Truckin'.

03:45.800 --> 03:47.900
I just wish my mother
could've seen it.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.700
Well, wherever she is,
I'm sure she's proud.

03:51.800 --> 03:54.700
Actually, I think I know
exactly where she is

03:54.800 --> 03:56.800
and it's pretty
fuckin' hot.

03:56.835 --> 03:58.800
You had one of those,
too, huh?

04:01.700 --> 04:03.165
Gentlemen.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.850
Is everything
okay here?

04:05.885 --> 04:08.500
Yeah, sure.
Just talkin'.

04:08.600 --> 04:11.265
Okay then.

04:11.300 --> 04:13.600
Have a good night.

04:24.700 --> 04:26.400
So they go through labor.
Big deal.

04:26.500 --> 04:29.100
Try a prostate exam.

04:31.500 --> 04:33.065
This is great.

04:33.100 --> 04:36.300
And I usually don't
like modern art.

04:38.700 --> 04:41.700
The Rat Pack.

04:42.900 --> 04:45.300
Do you know
a Joseph "Joey" Cogo?

04:47.000 --> 04:49.500
Not much, I mean,
I met him...

04:51.200 --> 04:52.465
last week.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.500
Me and Chrissy
were havin' dinner

04:54.535 --> 04:56.717
with Tony and his
friend, Valentina.

04:56.752 --> 04:58.900
Joey Cogo sent over
a bottle of Veuve.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.600
Wanna show
her those?

05:06.200 --> 05:08.800
Oh my God.

05:09.900 --> 05:11.900
Was this man
with him?

05:15.700 --> 05:17.200
Yeah.

05:17.300 --> 05:18.800
I saw him.

05:18.900 --> 05:22.700
- You're sure?
- Tuesday night.

05:36.200 --> 05:38.900
Jesus, 'cause
of what I said?

05:42.500 --> 05:44.265
You're supposed
to be earners.

05:44.300 --> 05:46.065
That's why you got
the top tier positions.

05:46.100 --> 05:48.300
So each one of ya go out
to your people on the street,

05:48.400 --> 05:51.400
crack some fuckin'...
Create some fuckin' earners out there!

05:51.500 --> 05:53.200
So, what's he sayin'?

05:53.300 --> 05:55.565
The way I remember
he said,

05:55.600 --> 05:59.100
"That's why you got
the top tier positions. "

05:59.135 --> 06:02.600
This other inaudible
is "Crack fuckin' heads,"

06:02.635 --> 06:05.465
not legs.

06:05.500 --> 06:08.000
I need a signature.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.700
Now that's it.
That's all I gotta say.

06:15.735 --> 06:18.500
Frankly,
I'm depressed and...

06:18.535 --> 06:20.000
Depressed and what?

06:20.100 --> 06:22.000
"Depressed
and ashamed. "

06:22.100 --> 06:24.900
So what about my Alan Stewart
shirt from that meeting?

06:26.000 --> 06:29.300
Ralph Cifaretto spilt
my coffee and ruined it.

06:29.400 --> 06:32.500
I can petty cash it.
Resubmit, okay?

06:38.200 --> 06:41.900
This Crazy Horse pole camera's
working out really good.

06:41.935 --> 06:44.900
Paulie Gualtieri's car again.
She's still lying.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.165
Listen, any chance
you could ask Ron

06:52.200 --> 06:54.100
if this falls under
the same arrangement?

06:54.200 --> 06:57.165
It's kinda soggy, you
wanna know the truth.

06:57.200 --> 07:00.800
- Pie. He was eating.
- Tony, this is federal redevelopment.

07:00.900 --> 07:03.700
I'll look into it.

07:05.800 --> 07:08.900
- So a speech, huh?
- The sound quality is amazing.

07:08.935 --> 07:10.900
New hats. Mic's right
in the button.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.900
Museum of Science
and Truckin'.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.850
I just wish my mother
could've seen it.

07:14.885 --> 07:16.792
Give it to Angela
and shut the door.

07:16.827 --> 07:18.700
Wherever she is,
I'm sure she's proud.

07:18.800 --> 07:20.800
What happened to the jury
tampering investigation

07:20.900 --> 07:23.500
- on Junior Soprano's trial?
- Actually, I...

07:23.600 --> 07:25.200
You guys just drop
the ball on that?

07:25.235 --> 07:26.965
Massarone's
a huge asset.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.200
- Couple him with...
- What? Three-year-old airline tickets?

07:30.300 --> 07:32.400
Some ties to
the Bevelaqua murder?

07:32.435 --> 07:34.665
Even if Massarone

07:34.700 --> 07:36.750
and 1,000 other
snitches pan out,

07:36.785 --> 07:39.192
we've still gotta
put Tony on trial.

07:39.227 --> 07:41.565
That's useless
until we find out how

07:41.600 --> 07:43.700
they penetrated
the anonymous jury system.

07:43.735 --> 07:45.765
And what? Jury duty's
not tough enough?

07:45.800 --> 07:48.400
You know we don't like
to dig into some citizen.

07:48.435 --> 07:51.000
Tough shit. One of those
citizens is a felon.

07:51.035 --> 07:53.100
Get on it.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.065
You know what's
goin' on here, right?

08:00.100 --> 08:03.200
He fucked up his six-figure future
with O'Melveny & Meyers

08:03.235 --> 08:05.765
when he blew
the Junior Soprano trial.

08:05.800 --> 08:09.700
Of course he'll keep tryin'
him until he fixes that.

08:12.100 --> 08:14.265
- Hey!
- Hey.

08:14.300 --> 08:16.000
There he is,
John Barrymore.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
- How are ya?
- All right.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.400
I thought nobody
ever comes to see you.

08:25.500 --> 08:27.400
I was droppin' off
some dandelions.

08:27.500 --> 08:31.000
Saw a beautiful patch
in a vacant lot over by 15th Street.

08:31.035 --> 08:33.167
- Nice salad.
- Any word about Tony B?

08:33.202 --> 08:35.265
Yeah, yeah,
should be any day now.

08:35.299 --> 08:37.799
Aunt Quintina's gonna call
the moment she hears.

08:37.900 --> 08:41.299
He's a good kid,
your cousin, huh? Smart.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.400
Fuckin' weirdo,
you ask me.

08:43.500 --> 08:46.900
All right, the vacant lot
over on 15th Street?

08:46.935 --> 08:50.300
That's where all the neighborhood
dogs go to piss.

08:52.300 --> 08:54.200
You goddamn clown.

08:56.400 --> 08:58.400
You got anything
lined up for the kid?

08:58.435 --> 08:59.965
Yeah, yeah, air-bags.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.565
We pull 'em
from boosted cars.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.800
People buy 'em
like you wouldn't fuckin' believe.

09:03.835 --> 09:05.765
Hey, legit dealers,
body shops...

09:05.800 --> 09:08.400
they reinstall
undeployed bags as new.

09:08.500 --> 09:10.065
Top dollar.

09:10.100 --> 09:11.865
Brave new world.

09:11.900 --> 09:15.200
Jesus Christ, they didn't even have
shoulder belts when I went away.

09:15.300 --> 09:17.500
So you'll let me know
when the kid gets out, huh?

09:17.535 --> 09:19.917
Yeah, we'll have
a party for him.

09:19.952 --> 09:22.300
- I love you, okay.
- All right.

09:32.200 --> 09:34.865
Come on, eat.
Don't be so sensitive.

09:34.900 --> 09:37.900
I was bein' polite.
It's like... it's like eatin' red fescue.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.900
I'll take an egg.
You want an egg?

09:39.935 --> 09:41.300
Bobby, make
my nephew an egg.

09:41.335 --> 09:43.200
I don't want an egg.

09:46.800 --> 09:48.765
Tony B.

09:48.800 --> 09:51.200
Like a welcome
home present.

09:51.300 --> 09:53.600
- What's that, a Motorola?
- Yeah.

09:53.700 --> 09:55.465
Supposed to be
the best.

09:55.500 --> 09:57.700
You know, I figured
he could use one.

09:57.735 --> 09:59.265
Call me when
he needs me.

09:59.300 --> 10:02.900
All the fellas
are gettin' out, huh?

10:03.000 --> 10:04.900
The class of 2004.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.700
Old rats
on a new ship.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.750
I think I'll take
an egg.

10:10.785 --> 10:12.665
Make us
a couple eggs.

10:12.700 --> 10:15.100
I'm doin' it. You told me.
He don't want one.

10:17.400 --> 10:20.900
- You and Tony Egg again.
- Tony Egg? Tony B.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.700
Like the time you two,
you took that camera in the bathroom

10:23.800 --> 10:26.700
at your sister Barbara's
confirmation.

10:29.700 --> 10:31.700
Hello?

10:33.500 --> 10:35.500
Oh, that's terrible.

10:36.900 --> 10:39.100
Where is he gonna
be laid out?

10:39.135 --> 10:42.167
Who now?
God damn it!

10:42.202 --> 10:45.200
Well, let us know.

10:46.200 --> 10:48.000
Carmine Lupertazzi.

10:48.100 --> 10:50.500
He passed
during the night.

10:50.600 --> 10:53.100
What a fuckin' blow.

10:53.200 --> 10:55.200
He was a great man.

10:55.300 --> 10:59.200
My cousin told me it was Carmine
who invented point shaving.

10:59.235 --> 11:02.500
C.C.N.Y. versus
Kentucky, 1951.

11:04.200 --> 11:07.200
Nobody beat the spread.
I bought a black Fleetwood.

11:12.800 --> 11:16.000
Anthony. Anthony, did I ever tell you
I want to be cremated?

11:16.035 --> 11:17.565
About four times.

11:17.600 --> 11:19.600
And don't throw my ashes
in somebody's yard

11:19.700 --> 11:21.500
or off some
fuckin' bridge.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.800
I wanna be on the mantelpiece
surrounded by family.

11:23.900 --> 11:25.900
Yeah, under the moose head,
I know.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.765
Keep jokin'. Let me
tell ya somethin'.

11:29.800 --> 11:31.800
It's like that game
we used to play as kids...

11:32.800 --> 11:34.465
crack the whip.

11:34.500 --> 11:36.850
You run around like
an idiot holdin' hands

11:36.885 --> 11:39.200
as tight as you can
and then the line snaps,

11:39.300 --> 11:42.500
somebody lets go
and you're next.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.100
Your father meant
a lot to all of us.

11:57.135 --> 11:58.900
And not just
financially either.

12:00.600 --> 12:02.500
How are ya?

12:03.600 --> 12:06.200
What's up, buddy?

12:09.000 --> 12:10.900
Nicole...

12:11.000 --> 12:13.900
- you remember Mr. Petrille?
- What, honey?

12:15.100 --> 12:17.365
He meant a lot to us.

12:17.400 --> 12:20.700
- Ginny.
- Phil, how ya doin'?

12:20.735 --> 12:22.700
- Hey, kid.
- Angelo.

12:22.735 --> 12:24.700
I'm heartbroken.

12:26.700 --> 12:29.400
- Nicole, you remember Mr. Garepe.
- Of course.

12:30.400 --> 12:32.200
That was my aunt.

12:32.300 --> 12:34.065
My cousin's out.

12:34.100 --> 12:35.850
Aw, that's great news.

12:35.885 --> 12:37.565
Start him off
small, T.

12:37.600 --> 12:40.200
You hear that?
Your cousin's out.

12:40.300 --> 12:43.100
- Oh, look who's comin'.
- What?

12:47.100 --> 12:49.000
- Hey there, handsome.
- Hey, baby.

12:49.035 --> 12:50.900
- How are ya?
- Good.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.100
Lorraine,
you're lookin' good.

12:53.200 --> 12:55.700
Yeah, keepin' it together
with pilates and gin.

12:55.800 --> 12:57.500
Sil, Paulie,
how's it hangin'?

12:57.535 --> 12:59.200
Still got the nice
manners, huh?

12:59.235 --> 13:01.000
Ah,

13:01.100 --> 13:03.200
this is my
nephew Christopher.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.800
Lady Shylock,
you got some reputation.

13:06.900 --> 13:08.800
Yeah, my mother said
that might happen.

13:08.900 --> 13:11.100
I'd like to introduce you
to the love of my life.

13:11.135 --> 13:13.465
This is my partner
Jason Evanina.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.965
- Honor to meet ya.
- Hey, how are ya?

13:16.000 --> 13:20.400
So Jesus leans off the cross
and whispers to Peter,

13:20.435 --> 13:22.800
"I can see your house
from here. "

13:28.800 --> 13:32.200
I'm so sorry.
This was such a shock.

13:35.400 --> 13:37.800
- This is a very hard day.
- I just saw Ginny.

13:37.900 --> 13:40.100
The flowers
are beautiful.

13:40.135 --> 13:42.300
- John, got a minute?
- Yeah.

13:43.400 --> 13:46.100
Nicole, I'm sorry.

13:47.700 --> 13:50.265
What's goin'
on here?

13:50.300 --> 13:52.600
- What are you talkin' about?
- My father.

13:52.635 --> 13:54.465
Look at his hands.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.600
- He looks peaceful.
- I'm talkin' about his rosary.

13:57.635 --> 13:58.965
The medal?

13:59.000 --> 14:00.800
You think I don't
know what that is?

14:00.900 --> 14:02.300
It's for Opus Dei.

14:02.400 --> 14:04.465
The fuck
is that about?

14:04.500 --> 14:07.200
In his later years,
your father was very sensitive about

14:07.300 --> 14:09.500
- what's been goin' on in the church.
- Bullshit!

14:09.600 --> 14:10.965
Your wife is into
Opus Dei.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.965
You told Colombino
to put it there.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
- You sure about that?
- Yes, John, I'm sure.

14:15.100 --> 14:16.565
Body's not even cold.

14:16.600 --> 14:19.265
No respect
for anything anymore.

14:19.300 --> 14:22.100
And New Jersey housewife
fundamentalist shit?

14:22.200 --> 14:23.600
I doubt it, John.

14:23.700 --> 14:25.465
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:25.500 --> 14:28.400
You yourself said
I was like another son to him.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.900
I was bein' polite.
It was his deathbed.

14:30.935 --> 14:33.265
I should've written
those words down.

14:33.300 --> 14:36.400
Maybe you should have,
'cause they don't mean anything anymore.

14:36.435 --> 14:38.400
You understand
what I'm sayin'?

14:42.300 --> 14:47.000
I saw a huge
mushroom cloud

14:49.500 --> 14:51.500
from the shell.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.300
Jim Campbell
might be alive today

14:55.335 --> 14:58.865
if he hadn't said to me,

14:58.900 --> 15:02.700
"Heffron, you stay
here with your gun.

15:03.700 --> 15:05.700
I'm going up. "

15:09.900 --> 15:14.200
All your life, you gotta remember
what one guy did

15:14.300 --> 15:17.200
because he thought
it was his job to do

15:17.300 --> 15:19.900
and he took
a shot for you.

15:27.200 --> 15:30.800
This shit's not supposed
to run and here I look like a raccoon.

15:30.835 --> 15:33.800
You are irresistible
and you know it.

15:33.835 --> 15:35.800
Danny said I was clingy.

15:35.900 --> 15:38.450
Fuck him. He's the one
with self-esteem issues.

15:38.485 --> 15:41.000
You don't know what
it's like out there, Ade.

15:41.100 --> 15:42.800
You're marrying
Christopher.

15:42.900 --> 15:46.100
He's handsome, makes money,
he's got great hair.

15:48.300 --> 15:50.400
Oh...

15:51.500 --> 15:54.300
Okay.

15:54.400 --> 15:57.200
You know I love animals,
but this thing is so gorgeous.

15:57.235 --> 16:00.100
Isn't it? My dad
almost had a stroke.

16:00.200 --> 16:01.865
But I told him,
"Hey, asshole,

16:01.900 --> 16:04.000
I'm the one taking
all the fucking risk here.

16:04.035 --> 16:05.800
I have to fake
the invoices. "

16:05.900 --> 16:09.200
Sometimes you gotta just take care
of yourself, you know?

16:10.300 --> 16:13.000
Sure you do, honey.

16:13.035 --> 16:15.317
Come here.

16:15.352 --> 16:17.565
- Oh.
- Mmm.

16:17.600 --> 16:20.100
Come on. Let's don't
keep your date waiting.

16:20.135 --> 16:22.200
He likes you,
I can tell.

16:27.100 --> 16:30.465
We got a white
wine for Ade.

16:30.500 --> 16:34.300
That's another
apple martini for you.

16:34.335 --> 16:35.600
Thank you, my dear.

16:35.700 --> 16:38.900
My Seven-and-7,
and nothing-and-nothing.

16:38.935 --> 16:41.900
Don't listen to him,
Chrissy.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.800
I think what you're
doing's brave.

16:45.100 --> 16:47.250
It's not for everybody.
Things are different

16:47.285 --> 16:49.400
when you don't have
that crutch, you know?

16:49.435 --> 16:51.900
We make up for it
other ways.

16:52.900 --> 16:54.965
My God,
it's hot in here.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.400
What do you expect?
You're dancing in a mink coat.

16:57.500 --> 16:59.765
It's fox.

16:59.800 --> 17:01.665
She's my fox
in a box.

17:01.700 --> 17:05.200
Let's see her box,
or maybe her socks.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.464
Stupid.

17:08.500 --> 17:11.400
Well, I have to wear fur
on the outside on account

17:11.435 --> 17:14.117
of being bare
everywhere else.

17:14.152 --> 17:16.800
- You believe this one?
- No shit.

17:23.099 --> 17:25.400
Every place I go,
I got substances

17:25.500 --> 17:28.300
I can't enjoy
shoved in my face.

17:28.400 --> 17:30.700
But I guess asking you
for a little support system

17:30.735 --> 17:32.700
in my own home
is way the fuck outta line.

17:32.800 --> 17:34.765
You gotta have
some more wine.

17:34.800 --> 17:37.050
Seemed to have
a good time tonight.

17:37.085 --> 17:39.300
What the fuck
you talking about?

17:39.400 --> 17:41.865
What, Tina?

17:41.900 --> 17:44.400
Come on, that cunt's
too full of herself, anyway.

17:44.435 --> 17:46.917
Cunt? She's my maid
of honor, Christopher.

17:46.952 --> 17:49.400
She's no fucking maid,
let me tell you.

17:53.600 --> 17:56.100
Great, now I'm upset.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.665
See what
I'm talking about?

17:57.700 --> 18:00.900
But I guess
it's all my problem.

18:03.800 --> 18:07.500
I'm sorry, baby.
Okay?

18:10.600 --> 18:12.400
Please, stop.

18:14.200 --> 18:17.650
All right, all right.
My handsome nephew.

18:17.685 --> 18:21.100
Auntie Quin, look at you
all dolled up, huh?

18:22.600 --> 18:25.200
I never thought I'd live
to see this day.

18:25.300 --> 18:27.000
Well, here ya are,
still here.

18:27.100 --> 18:28.465
Where's Tony?

18:28.500 --> 18:31.100
Downstairs getting
into one of his old suits.

18:31.135 --> 18:33.717
- I'll buy him some new suits.
- He's fine.

18:33.752 --> 18:36.300
I only wish he had more
to come back to.

18:37.300 --> 18:40.065
That ex-wife of his...

18:40.100 --> 18:42.700
she uses her
answering machine

18:42.800 --> 18:46.200
to ignore me, so forget about
his seeing the twins.

18:48.100 --> 18:50.600
How's Kelly?
How's she doing?

18:50.635 --> 18:53.100
Well, she's lost
to us, Anthony.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.065
But Tony says

18:55.100 --> 18:58.200
he's gonna hire
a detective.

18:58.235 --> 19:00.065
Look at this.

19:00.100 --> 19:01.900
The two of you
were so cute.

19:03.300 --> 19:05.700
Even then, my cannoli
was bigger than his.

19:05.800 --> 19:07.500
Ooh, stop.

19:09.600 --> 19:12.900
Aw, man.
There he is.

19:16.100 --> 19:17.700
Ah.

19:23.600 --> 19:25.665
God, Ton'.
Look at us.

19:25.700 --> 19:29.265
- 15 fucking years.
- The language.

19:29.300 --> 19:32.600
Go ahead say it.
I haven't changed a bit, right?

19:34.500 --> 19:37.000
You look good,
you look good.

19:39.900 --> 19:42.400
Say "provolone. "

19:43.900 --> 19:46.100
Surprise!

19:46.200 --> 19:47.465
Shit.

19:47.500 --> 19:50.500
Very nice, you give me
a heart attack.

19:50.600 --> 19:52.965
Ma, it's enough,
all right?

19:53.000 --> 19:55.600
Stop crying.
I'm embarrassed enough.

19:56.600 --> 19:58.850
I don't know
what to say.

19:58.885 --> 20:01.100
Don't say anything.
Just eat.

20:01.135 --> 20:03.965
- Oh, hey!
- Ha!

20:04.000 --> 20:07.700
I got peppers been
marinating for 15 years!

20:07.735 --> 20:09.565
Hey.

20:09.600 --> 20:12.800
- What?
- Where's Tubs?

20:12.835 --> 20:14.700
- Artie?
- Yo.

20:14.800 --> 20:17.200
- What happened here?
- Still a ball-breaker, huh?

20:23.800 --> 20:26.100
What the fuck's
with him?

20:26.200 --> 20:28.065
Ask him.

20:28.100 --> 20:30.865
You guys
have a beef?

20:30.900 --> 20:33.600
I loaned the guy some money
then he tried to kill himself.

20:33.700 --> 20:36.900
And guess
who got the blame?

20:36.935 --> 20:39.800
Oh my God, Tony.

20:39.900 --> 20:42.300
My God, we have
all missed you so much.

20:42.335 --> 20:44.417
I swear, you look
exactly the same.

20:44.452 --> 20:46.500
Oh, you're still
full of shit, huh?

20:46.535 --> 20:50.200
Is Nancy here yet?
The twins?

20:50.300 --> 20:51.865
No, Nancy
couldn't make it.

20:51.900 --> 20:53.900
Her aunt in Bayonne,
the sciatica.

21:01.300 --> 21:04.600
- What are you gonna do?
- Cousin!

21:04.635 --> 21:06.465
Jan.

21:06.500 --> 21:08.500
Come, come, I want you
to meet my family.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.500
I'm talking
to him right now.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.800
- Tony, you remember Bobby.
- Oh, yeah.

21:12.835 --> 21:14.965
- Good to see you.
- Now my husband.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.600
And guys, this is your
Uncle Tony Blundetto.

21:17.700 --> 21:19.165
Hey, there.

21:19.200 --> 21:21.800
How come we never
met you before?

21:23.100 --> 21:25.000
I've been away
on business.

21:25.100 --> 21:26.700
I've never even
heard of you.

21:28.300 --> 21:31.100
Stop playing
with your ice, come on.

21:33.100 --> 21:36.065
They let that kid
say anything.

21:36.100 --> 21:38.700
- Welcome home, Uncle Tony.
- Oh, Jesus.

21:39.700 --> 21:41.800
This is Meadow.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.165
God, you turned out
beautiful, honey.

21:45.200 --> 21:49.000
And this strapping
young man is Anthony Jr.

21:49.035 --> 21:52.265
How's Kelly?

21:52.300 --> 21:55.200
Our regular dinner,
out by you Thursday, right?

21:55.235 --> 21:56.700
Yes, Daddy.

21:56.800 --> 21:59.800
See with my family
now, you know, the separation,

21:59.835 --> 22:02.800
you gotta make an appointment
to see each other.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.600
I should go see
Uncle Zio.

22:08.635 --> 22:10.665
- Yeah.
- All right.

22:10.700 --> 22:13.500
- Show him the phone!
- Yeah.

22:41.400 --> 22:43.465
Tony.

22:43.500 --> 22:46.200
I'll make this fast
'cause I know you're all hungry.

22:47.700 --> 22:51.500
I remember growing up,
I was always asking

22:51.600 --> 22:54.865
why I just used
to have sisters.

22:54.900 --> 22:57.600
I said to my mother, I said,
"Can't you save up something

22:57.635 --> 23:00.465
and then get me
a baby brother?"

23:00.500 --> 23:03.800
And my mother said,
"What's wrong with your cousin Tony?"

23:03.835 --> 23:08.100
And she was right,
'cause we were brothers.

23:09.100 --> 23:12.100
Except, you know,
we had the same name.

23:12.135 --> 23:15.100
There was like 50 Tonys
in the family.

23:17.100 --> 23:21.000
Some of you remember this.
My dad's name was Johnny

23:21.035 --> 23:23.665
and his dad's name
was Alfred.

23:23.700 --> 23:27.200
And so whenever we were out
running around and we'd hear

23:27.235 --> 23:30.417
"Tony Uncle Johnny,"
that was for me.

23:30.452 --> 23:32.976
And "Tony Uncle Al,"
that was for him.

23:33.011 --> 23:35.500
And there was
"Tony Uncle Philly!"

23:35.600 --> 23:37.700
- Remember?
- Right, yeah, yeah.

23:37.800 --> 23:41.700
But he passed away...
buon' anima.

23:41.800 --> 23:43.465
And Uncle Phil...

23:43.500 --> 23:46.800
Uncle Phil, he passed away
a long time ago, too.

23:46.835 --> 23:48.800
So...

23:48.900 --> 23:50.900
anyway.

23:52.600 --> 23:55.800
Tony's being away
has been hard.

23:57.600 --> 24:01.100
But he's back now,
for good.

24:06.200 --> 24:07.900
So welcome home.

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
- Welcome home.
- Thank you.

24:11.035 --> 24:13.265
Salut.

24:13.300 --> 24:15.100
Come on, let me hear it.
Welcome home!

24:15.135 --> 24:18.700
Welcome home!

24:18.800 --> 24:21.100
Tony, Meadow is incredible.

24:21.135 --> 24:23.365
She's a fucking Ivy Leaguer.

24:23.400 --> 24:26.300
- You and Carm hit a home run.
- Yeah.

24:26.400 --> 24:28.700
I'm sure Kelly's all right,
wherever she is.

24:28.735 --> 24:30.600
Hey, her old man
was in prison.

24:30.700 --> 24:32.700
We tried to do
everything we could.

24:32.735 --> 24:34.700
I wasn't around.
What could I expect?

24:34.800 --> 24:37.700
If things had gone different
way back when, who knows?

24:40.900 --> 24:43.500
- What do you want from me?
- Nothing!

24:43.600 --> 24:46.300
I'm just saying it's good
it wasn't both of us.

24:48.100 --> 24:50.400
These things
happen, right?

24:51.800 --> 24:55.400
You're gonna like this place.
This is nice.

24:55.500 --> 24:58.900
This is the kind of place we always
talked about having.

25:04.300 --> 25:06.065
Fucking weird.

25:06.100 --> 25:07.800
My cousin
in the old man's seat.

25:07.835 --> 25:09.500
It's like
Sun Tizzu says...

25:09.600 --> 25:11.300
"A good commander
is benevolent

25:11.400 --> 25:13.900
and unconcerned
with fame. "

25:13.935 --> 25:16.500
- What?
- Sun Tizzu.

25:16.600 --> 25:18.500
The Chinese
Prince Machiavelli.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.500
Tony turned me
on to him.

25:20.535 --> 25:23.365
Tzu, Tzu!

25:23.400 --> 25:25.700
Sun Tzu, you
fucking ass-kiss.

25:25.800 --> 25:27.900
Hey.

25:27.935 --> 25:30.000
Feech!

25:30.100 --> 25:32.400
You know I missed you
by two weeks at Allenwood.

25:44.100 --> 25:46.300
This'll help
you get started.

25:46.400 --> 25:48.065
Jesus, you're on
your feet already?

25:48.100 --> 25:51.000
You hit the ground running
and you don't look back, huh?

25:51.035 --> 25:52.900
Thank you.

25:53.900 --> 25:55.400
Come on.

25:57.100 --> 25:59.400
So you in on the bus
station project?

25:59.435 --> 26:01.400
Massarone's waiting
on a number.

26:01.500 --> 26:03.800
- How's he doing?
- Good.

26:03.835 --> 26:05.865
We had coffee.

26:05.900 --> 26:08.765
He used to bore me,
Jack.

26:08.800 --> 26:10.900
But he ain't a bad guy
once you get to know him.

26:10.935 --> 26:13.300
I always liked him.

26:16.800 --> 26:20.300
I was very touched
by that funeral the other day.

26:20.400 --> 26:23.400
- Real heart-grabber.
- That fucking little Carmine.

26:23.500 --> 26:26.400
And after what?
Five years in Florida

26:26.500 --> 26:29.000
fixing wet t-shirt
contests.

26:39.300 --> 26:41.400
M'boy are you fat.

26:43.800 --> 26:45.165
What did you say?

26:45.200 --> 26:48.000
Reginald
Van Gleason III.

26:48.035 --> 26:51.100
"M'boy are you fat. "

26:52.800 --> 26:55.400
That's good, yeah.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.200
Oh!

27:04.000 --> 27:07.200
So I got some ideas,
you know, for you.

27:07.300 --> 27:08.965
Get you on your feet.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.600
Unless, of course, you already know
what you wanna do.

27:11.635 --> 27:13.165
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

27:13.200 --> 27:17.400
- Well, yeah. I kinda got an idea.
- Yeah?

27:19.700 --> 27:22.700
Like four years in I got
moved to Springfield.

27:22.800 --> 27:25.100
You know, where they got
the big prison hospital.

27:25.135 --> 27:27.865
It's mostly stab wounds,
detox.

27:27.900 --> 27:31.200
Anyway, this guy I knew from Elkton,
he was telling me

27:31.300 --> 27:33.600
how I could be
an orderly, you know?

27:33.635 --> 27:35.700
And how it's easy
time and all.

27:35.800 --> 27:37.800
Well, you know,
so then you're the guy

27:37.900 --> 27:39.800
that hooks everybody up.
That's smart.

27:39.900 --> 27:41.800
Yeah, but it wasn't
business for me.

27:41.900 --> 27:44.200
I mean I really got
into this shit.

27:44.300 --> 27:48.100
Rehab block had guys
with broken limbs, muscle diseases

27:48.135 --> 27:50.465
and we'd help
them back.

27:50.500 --> 27:54.400
So, I think this might
be a thing I can do.

27:56.400 --> 27:58.900
I got my associate's
degree already.

27:58.935 --> 28:00.965
Took me five years.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
And now it's only
like six months more

28:03.035 --> 28:04.800
for my massage license.

28:04.900 --> 28:07.200
So you wanna run
a massage parlor?

28:07.235 --> 28:09.500
No.

28:10.700 --> 28:13.300
I'm gonna be a licensed
massage therapist.

28:16.200 --> 28:19.400
Look, I've been away
from all this a long time.

28:19.500 --> 28:22.700
I mean if I got
a shot at staying out

28:22.800 --> 28:26.200
and putting shit together,
I should take it.

28:26.235 --> 28:27.965
Oh.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.400
'Cause I was thinking,
you know,

28:30.435 --> 28:32.800
I got this air-bag
thing going...

28:32.900 --> 28:34.800
Oh, Tony, thanks,
but...

28:34.900 --> 28:36.600
I mean it's
a really nice offer,

28:36.700 --> 28:39.200
but I need regular work
until I'm certified.

28:39.300 --> 28:41.300
Just regular work.

28:45.700 --> 28:48.800
Well, I guess I know
this guy looking for...

28:49.900 --> 28:52.465
a delivery man
for his linen fleet.

28:52.500 --> 28:55.300
- Bobby Gociletto?
- No, no, no, Koreans.

28:58.400 --> 29:00.300
You know, I don't got
my driver's license.

29:00.400 --> 29:02.400
So you'll go to my guy
at the DMV.

29:04.500 --> 29:08.100
As far as the union shit,
I can take care of that.

29:09.400 --> 29:11.300
Wow, Tony.
Thanks.

29:11.335 --> 29:13.200
Thank you.

29:15.200 --> 29:18.100
- You're the best, you know that?
- Yeah, yeah.

29:29.500 --> 29:32.065
- Out.
- Why?

29:32.100 --> 29:35.100
Because we are watching
a movie and you are studying.

29:35.135 --> 29:37.300
And why must we keep
having that conversation?

29:39.800 --> 29:42.700
Here it is. #1 on the American
Film Institute's

29:42.735 --> 29:44.700
Greatest American
Movies list.

29:44.800 --> 29:47.765
- "Citizen Kane. "
- Jesus, it's black and white.

29:47.800 --> 29:51.200
That is what film club is all about...
trying new things.

29:51.300 --> 29:53.700
Now, to give us
some background,

29:53.800 --> 29:55.800
let's see what
Leonard Maltin has to say.

29:57.400 --> 30:00.500
"A film that broke all the rules
and invented some new ones.

30:00.600 --> 30:04.050
The cinematography, music
and Oscar-winning screenplay

30:04.085 --> 30:07.500
by Welles and Herman
J- something are all first rate. "

31:21.100 --> 31:24.500
- Wow.
- So it was a sled, huh?

31:24.600 --> 31:26.500
He should've
told somebody.

31:26.600 --> 31:29.200
I think it's fascinating
the man had all that stuff,

31:29.300 --> 31:33.100
but he died alone
with nothing and nobody.

31:33.135 --> 31:35.765
Good.
Prick.

31:35.800 --> 31:37.765
I hated it.
"You supply the war.

31:37.800 --> 31:40.800
I'll supply the headlines. "
How conceited.

31:45.100 --> 31:47.400
There was
the cinematography.

31:47.435 --> 31:49.700
Yeah, that
was very good.

31:54.200 --> 31:57.000
- Oh my God.
- What?

31:57.100 --> 31:59.700
I saw Laura Basi
in the dressing room at Loehmann's.

31:59.735 --> 32:01.967
Definitely
had some work.

32:02.002 --> 32:04.200
D- cup at least
and a lift.

32:04.300 --> 32:07.100
Well, she said she was
remodeling her upstairs.

32:07.135 --> 32:09.700
But I had no idea.

32:13.400 --> 32:16.000
So, Carm,
how you doing?

32:16.100 --> 32:17.900
I'm okay.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.400
My lawyer, he's a top guy...
Robert Greenberg.

32:21.435 --> 32:23.365
He says that New Jersey

32:23.400 --> 32:25.465
has this equitable
distribution law.

32:25.500 --> 32:29.000
So apparently 20 years entitles me
to at least half his money.

32:29.100 --> 32:30.565
Well, it should.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.800
You made Tony a home,
you raised his children.

32:32.900 --> 32:35.750
Does this guy know
how to get it?

32:35.785 --> 32:38.565
Well, it's mostly
cash, obviously.

32:38.600 --> 32:41.965
God, all those years
and you could get nothing.

32:42.000 --> 32:45.100
This other lawyer, Dan Minditch
says that we should play hardball.

32:45.200 --> 32:47.350
You know, go after
the real assets.

32:47.385 --> 32:49.500
Marriage is beautiful
in the beginning,

32:49.535 --> 32:52.600
but two,
three years later?

32:52.700 --> 32:55.500
You'd think there'd be
some romance at least.

32:55.535 --> 32:57.165
Janice, you're
a newlywed.

32:57.200 --> 33:00.400
I know. Six months and Bobby
still hasn't found my rosebud.

33:02.600 --> 33:05.600
Maybe he should
hire a reporter.

33:05.700 --> 33:08.500
So the movie's over
and they all start talking

33:08.535 --> 33:11.300
about their marriages
and how miserable they are.

33:11.335 --> 33:13.565
Bitterness.

33:13.600 --> 33:15.400
So besides
the movie night?

33:15.435 --> 33:18.100
- You have kids?
- No.

33:19.600 --> 33:22.200
So did you attend
Carmine Lupertazzi's funeral?

33:22.235 --> 33:24.965
I didn't know him.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.465
Movie night
was fun, though.

33:26.500 --> 33:29.500
Who was there
at the Tony Blundetto homecoming?

33:29.535 --> 33:31.765
I told you,
just family.

33:31.800 --> 33:35.800
God, is that all you think about
is your fucking work?

33:37.600 --> 33:40.900
You don't care how
I feel about anything.

33:44.500 --> 33:46.300
Okay.

33:48.700 --> 33:51.400
I was married
to an agent.

33:52.900 --> 33:55.700
What happened?
Did he cheat on you?

33:57.200 --> 33:59.200
While we were trying
to get pregnant

33:59.300 --> 34:02.100
he climbed right over me
to become an assistant supervisor

34:02.135 --> 34:04.065
on the Milken
task force.

34:04.100 --> 34:07.100
Moved to Los Angeles and jumped
a pay grade without me.

34:07.200 --> 34:10.100
My God, that's terrible.

34:11.199 --> 34:14.000
So where were we?

34:19.300 --> 34:20.965
What am I doing?

34:21.000 --> 34:23.800
I can't talk to you.
I can't even talk to Christopher

34:23.900 --> 34:25.900
and he's my soul mate
for God's sake.

34:25.935 --> 34:27.900
I can't talk
to my friends.

34:29.400 --> 34:32.199
I am being ripped
apart here

34:32.300 --> 34:34.100
just snitching
on people.

34:34.199 --> 34:37.364
For what? What do
I get out of it?

34:37.400 --> 34:40.400
Take some comfort in the fact
that you're trying to do the right thing

34:40.500 --> 34:43.199
- by helping your government.
- No, seriously.

34:45.400 --> 34:48.300
For me, it was when
I was in college.

34:48.335 --> 34:50.764
My sister's
boyfriend Kyle

34:50.800 --> 34:53.000
traded our TV
for six handguns.

34:53.034 --> 34:55.165
He sold five
to a high school kid

34:55.199 --> 34:58.800
then used the last one
to open a coconut.

34:58.900 --> 35:01.400
The ricochet left
my sister a paraplegic.

35:04.700 --> 35:07.100
I knew I had to do something
about guys like him.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.600
And nowhere but the FBI
is the line clearer

35:11.700 --> 35:13.900
between the good guys
and the bad guys.

35:16.500 --> 35:20.300
And you're with
the good guys now.

35:25.200 --> 35:27.800
Wow.

35:27.835 --> 35:30.400
Jesus.

35:35.600 --> 35:38.365
- Hey.
- TB.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.500
I didn't call
for no linen delivery.

35:40.600 --> 35:42.700
What do I find
at the pork store?

35:42.735 --> 35:44.800
A bunch of guys
beating the meat.

35:46.400 --> 35:48.600
- Wanna deal me in?
- Absolutely.

35:48.700 --> 35:50.400
Stakes might be
a little high for you.

35:50.500 --> 35:52.700
You know you can't
pay us in napkins.

35:54.500 --> 35:58.300
You got to let that dry
before you put on a second coat?

35:58.400 --> 36:00.700
Fucking Grandpa
Munster over here.

36:00.735 --> 36:01.965
Oh!

36:02.000 --> 36:04.700
You gonna deal those?
They're not candy bars.

36:04.735 --> 36:06.600
You can let
some of 'em go.

36:09.300 --> 36:11.900
What the fuck's that for?
Drying shirts?

36:14.700 --> 36:16.700
It's a Tao master
massage chair.

36:24.600 --> 36:27.200
I had no idea
I was so tense.

36:27.300 --> 36:30.200
It's like my back
is on vacation.

36:30.235 --> 36:33.100
Well, it could
definitely use one.

36:38.400 --> 36:40.350
What the fuck
is this?

36:40.385 --> 36:42.342
Hey T, you gotta
try this.

36:42.377 --> 36:44.265
He's really
fucking good.

36:44.300 --> 36:46.065
Nothing like being
in the joint

36:46.100 --> 36:49.800
to teach you how to ease
another man's tensions.

36:49.835 --> 36:51.565
Jesus Christ,
I'm gone for one hour.

36:51.600 --> 36:54.800
All of a sudden it turns
into a fucking slumber party.

36:54.835 --> 36:57.600
Somebody woke up
on the wrong side of the bed.

36:59.300 --> 37:01.300
Could I talk
to you a minute?

37:08.400 --> 37:10.365
None of your
fucking business

37:10.400 --> 37:12.300
which side of the bed
I wake up on.

37:12.400 --> 37:14.365
Jesus, it's just
an expression.

37:14.400 --> 37:16.900
Bullshit. Don't tell me you don't know
what I'm talking about.

37:16.935 --> 37:19.700
All that Reggie Van Gleason,
"M'boy are you fat. "

37:19.735 --> 37:21.700
Things have changed
around here.

37:21.800 --> 37:24.400
I'm the boss
of this fucking family.

37:25.800 --> 37:27.565
You're crowding me.

37:27.600 --> 37:30.600
You don't make fun of me.
Got it?

37:33.000 --> 37:34.900
Got it.

37:39.600 --> 37:41.165
And knock off
the massage shit.

37:41.200 --> 37:44.500
It's a place of business,
not a Jack LaLanne.

37:54.400 --> 37:57.150
# Beauty queen
of only 18... #

37:57.185 --> 37:59.900
You gotta
declare all that?

38:01.900 --> 38:03.765
Most of it, anyway.

38:03.800 --> 38:06.300
Well, if you had
a good bookkeeper...

38:06.400 --> 38:08.165
Hey, you got change?

38:08.200 --> 38:10.200
Been fucking sliding
this stupid bill in and out

38:10.300 --> 38:12.750
of the cigarette machine
for like an hour.

38:12.785 --> 38:15.200
An hour?
I bet you can go longer than that.

38:15.235 --> 38:17.865
Listen to you.

38:17.900 --> 38:20.300
Why do you always
talk like a whore?

38:20.335 --> 38:22.800
Because men like it.

38:22.835 --> 38:24.100
Yeah?

38:24.200 --> 38:27.500
I think you're
right about that.

38:27.600 --> 38:30.500
# Somehow,
I want more #

38:32.200 --> 38:35.600
# I don't mind
spending every day #

38:35.700 --> 38:39.900
# Out on your corner
in the pouring rain. #

38:40.000 --> 38:42.465
I'm telling you I'm
having a fucking time.

38:42.500 --> 38:45.500
Stay out late, come home drunk,
fuck anyone I want.

38:45.600 --> 38:47.800
Yeah, so what's
the difference?

38:49.700 --> 38:52.600
I don't know.
It's a mindset.

38:52.635 --> 38:54.565
Jesus Christ.

38:54.600 --> 38:57.450
Tony, I was hoping you'd be here.
I gotta tell you,

38:57.485 --> 39:00.300
you shouldn't eat up there
in Fairfield no more.

39:00.335 --> 39:02.265
What the fuck
you talking about?

39:02.300 --> 39:04.265
I went to collect
from my cop up there

39:04.300 --> 39:07.500
and he gave me a heads up.
His buddy on the force saw some car

39:07.535 --> 39:10.617
out by Napoleon's Diner
a couple of weeks ago.

39:10.652 --> 39:13.700
And I remembered
how your goomah lives up there.

39:16.100 --> 39:18.500
- Yeah?
- Guy thought maybe they were fags,

39:18.535 --> 39:20.965
but he ran the plate

39:21.000 --> 39:22.900
and it bounced
back a no-hit.

39:22.935 --> 39:24.300
Feds.

39:24.400 --> 39:28.000
Cop said they were
just sitting there in the rain.

39:30.300 --> 39:33.400
They always do that, but I know
it wasn't me they tailed that night

39:33.435 --> 39:35.600
'cause my whole life's
in the fucking rear view.

39:35.700 --> 39:37.765
- Mine, too.
- Absolutely.

39:37.800 --> 39:41.000
It's Massarone.
Aw, Jesus Christ.

39:41.100 --> 39:44.200
If he flipped
I'd be fucked.

39:44.300 --> 39:46.465
We all would.

39:46.500 --> 39:48.365
Well he ain't been
to the grand jury,

39:48.400 --> 39:51.400
because we would have
heard from our girl up there.

39:51.500 --> 39:53.700
They could be just following
him at this point,

39:53.735 --> 39:55.717
see if they could
get anything on him.

39:55.752 --> 39:57.700
Yeah, and eventually
they'll bring him in.

39:57.800 --> 40:01.100
They've turned a lot fucking tougher
guys than Jack Massarone.

40:02.500 --> 40:04.350
You want me
to take care of it?

40:04.385 --> 40:06.200
No, we don't know
shit yet, right?

40:10.900 --> 40:14.400
He did give me that
fucking painting, though.

40:14.435 --> 40:16.065
There was that,
Tony.

40:16.100 --> 40:18.700
Can't a guy be fucking
nice anymore? Friendly?

40:21.600 --> 40:23.565
So what do
you wanna do?

40:23.600 --> 40:25.600
I wanna be absolutely
fucking sure.

40:25.635 --> 40:28.665
That's what
I wanna do.

40:28.700 --> 40:31.700
We arrange a meet.
I'll feel him out a little bit.

40:34.500 --> 40:36.265
I gotta do it.

40:36.300 --> 40:38.900
I know the guy.
I know the way he thinks.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
I know the way
he acts.

40:43.100 --> 40:45.500
My old man was very good
at vibing people out, too.

40:45.600 --> 40:47.600
If Massarone's
up to something

40:47.700 --> 40:49.700
I'll pick it up.

40:53.700 --> 40:55.800
You piece of shit.

40:55.900 --> 40:57.800
I don't believe this.

41:10.100 --> 41:12.600
Hold on.

41:14.100 --> 41:15.865
Yeah.

41:15.900 --> 41:19.700
I just wanted to thank you for taking
the components out of the home theater.

41:19.800 --> 41:22.700
Hey, I bought that for us to watch
movies as a family, okay?

41:22.800 --> 41:24.865
Not to entertain
your girlfriends.

41:24.900 --> 41:27.900
I talked to my lawyer about filing
a separation agreement.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.665
I'm not paying
a lawyer.

41:29.700 --> 41:32.200
We should be able to settle
this thing like adults!

41:32.235 --> 41:35.900
Then stop taking shit
out of the house!

41:47.300 --> 41:50.800
- Hey Tony, what's up?
- Let's take a walk.

41:56.300 --> 41:58.100
There he is, huh?

41:58.200 --> 41:59.900
Hey, how you doing?

42:00.000 --> 42:01.865
- Good, good. How are you doing?
- Okay.

42:01.900 --> 42:05.200
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, watch the curb.

42:05.300 --> 42:07.800
Hey, wait a second.
Before you say anything,

42:07.835 --> 42:10.417
have you lost
a little weight?

42:10.452 --> 42:13.326
You think, huh?
I don't know.

42:13.361 --> 42:16.165
Listen, I talked
to our friend.

42:16.200 --> 42:18.550
- The one that celebrates Hanukkah?
- Uh-huh.

42:18.585 --> 42:20.900
- It's in the works.
- Oh great, it's good news.

42:20.935 --> 42:23.717
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Yeah.

42:23.752 --> 42:26.126
So I been meaning
to ask you

42:26.161 --> 42:28.680
you noticed
anything lately?

42:28.715 --> 42:31.165
What are we
talking about?

42:31.200 --> 42:34.000
You weren't followed
here, were you?

42:34.100 --> 42:36.200
No, I...
I don't think so.

42:36.300 --> 42:38.700
I'm... I'm pretty
careful.

42:38.800 --> 42:41.000
All right.

42:41.100 --> 42:45.200
Everything else okay,
good EKG and shit, huh?

42:45.300 --> 42:47.800
- Yeah, I guess.
- All right.

42:47.900 --> 42:51.600
But I gotta tell you,
I don't like what I'm hearing.

42:56.500 --> 42:59.065
Relax.

42:59.100 --> 43:01.300
It's not worth
losing your hair over.

43:01.400 --> 43:03.600
- Right?
- Okay.

43:03.635 --> 43:05.200
All right.

43:08.500 --> 43:10.265
I couldn't tell shit.

43:10.300 --> 43:11.900
What the fuck am I,
a mind reader?

43:18.500 --> 43:20.600
So what's the next
step here, Ton'?

43:23.100 --> 43:24.965
What?

43:25.000 --> 43:28.100
Said I looked like
I lost some weight.

43:30.400 --> 43:32.500
Oh.

43:33.700 --> 43:35.800
The motherfucker.

43:38.900 --> 43:41.365
Yeah?

43:41.400 --> 43:44.200
Hey, whoa, whoa.
Take it easy.

43:46.400 --> 43:48.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
hold on.

43:48.535 --> 43:50.465
That Korean... Kim.

43:50.500 --> 43:52.600
Something about your
cousin... I don't know.

43:58.900 --> 44:01.265
Yeah?

44:01.300 --> 44:04.165
It's your fucking
linen truck.

44:04.200 --> 44:06.565
What do you want me
to do about it?

44:06.600 --> 44:08.965
Yeah, yeah, it's okay.
Fire him. Go ahead.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.300
Put him out in the fucking
street for all I care!

44:18.300 --> 44:20.765
If Tony B wants
to pick up some scratch

44:20.800 --> 44:24.600
he could do this Massarone thing...
if it goes.

44:24.700 --> 44:26.200
What the fuck
is wrong with you?!

44:26.300 --> 44:28.265
The man is trying
to go straight.

44:28.300 --> 44:31.000
Don't you give a fuck
about your cousin?!

44:31.100 --> 44:32.600
I'm sorry, T.
You're right.

44:36.200 --> 44:39.100
That was a great party
the other night.

44:40.100 --> 44:42.300
Fuck him.

44:42.400 --> 44:44.500
Guy is fucking
useless to me.

44:54.100 --> 44:56.200
Was that a yes
on Massarone?

44:58.000 --> 45:01.500
Tony's got
his own process.

45:01.535 --> 45:04.300
What's to process here?

45:06.700 --> 45:10.200
Honestly, Carm, this is a lot better
than watching "Casablanca. "

45:11.400 --> 45:14.400
I didn't need to see
that movie again anyway.

45:14.435 --> 45:16.400
Even if it kills Tony,

45:16.500 --> 45:18.700
I will have that system
back for next time.

45:18.800 --> 45:21.300
So what is next
on that list?

45:24.900 --> 45:26.900
Number three...
"The Godfather. "

45:31.100 --> 45:34.500
Look at us. We'll kill ourselves
for these cigarettes.

45:35.900 --> 45:38.400
You know they had
a bear back here?

45:38.500 --> 45:41.000
So how come Angie Bonpensiero
don't come?

45:41.035 --> 45:43.167
Please. She's not
welcome here.

45:43.202 --> 45:45.251
I thought everybody
liked her.

45:45.286 --> 45:47.300
Don't you know
about Pussy?

45:48.500 --> 45:51.300
He went in the program.
He turned on everybody...

45:51.400 --> 45:53.900
us, the people he knew
his whole life.

45:56.600 --> 46:00.000
Who knows why people
do what they do?

46:00.100 --> 46:02.350
But what kind
of person does that?

46:02.385 --> 46:04.692
I mean it's like
Judas or something,

46:04.727 --> 46:06.965
eating that last
supper with Jesus.

46:07.000 --> 46:10.400
And the whole time he knows
they're gonna crucify him.

46:10.500 --> 46:12.600
I mean, at least Judas
didn't go into any

46:12.635 --> 46:14.765
apostle protection
program.

46:14.800 --> 46:17.300
He hung himself.
He knew what he did.

46:22.900 --> 46:25.200
Oh, look at you.
You're shivering.

46:26.400 --> 46:28.700
I didn't know it was
that cold, sweetie.

47:43.400 --> 47:46.600
I'll tell you, I don't know how
I'd be holding up.

47:46.635 --> 47:48.200
It's just...

47:48.300 --> 47:51.700
I guess you all are
really important to me.

47:51.800 --> 47:54.800
Aw, Carm,
you'd do the same.

47:54.835 --> 47:56.800
We love you so much.

47:59.700 --> 48:02.000
Ade, you okay?

48:07.700 --> 48:09.900
What's the matter?

48:14.200 --> 48:17.600
I'm not what you think.

48:17.635 --> 48:21.000
I don't know
what to do.

48:21.035 --> 48:22.965
I need...

48:23.000 --> 48:25.700
I wanna tell you
all something.

48:25.735 --> 48:27.465
It's driving me crazy.

48:27.500 --> 48:31.000
You know you can
tell us anything.

48:42.000 --> 48:43.900
Oh God.

48:46.900 --> 48:49.600
She's been drinking
like crazy.

48:54.500 --> 48:56.500
Where are you going?

48:56.535 --> 48:58.800
Oh, my God!

48:58.900 --> 49:00.800
Ah!

49:00.900 --> 49:03.000
Honey!

49:03.100 --> 49:05.200
I'm fine, okay?
Just leave me alone.

49:05.235 --> 49:07.300
No, you're bleeding.
Let me drive you.

49:55.200 --> 49:58.500
Ton'? It's like 3:00
in the morning.

49:58.535 --> 50:00.400
Yeah, yeah.
I couldn't sleep

50:00.500 --> 50:02.300
so I wanted to see
if the phone worked.

50:02.400 --> 50:04.965
Well, yeah,
it works great.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.400
I'm in my mother's basement
and I can really hear you.

50:07.435 --> 50:10.700
Listen, you should
know that...

50:10.735 --> 50:12.767
that boss there, Kim,

50:12.802 --> 50:14.765
he's after your ass.

50:14.800 --> 50:16.765
I rub him
the wrong way.

50:16.800 --> 50:19.500
Maybe you shouldn't
be a masseuse then.

50:19.600 --> 50:21.765
Oh.

50:21.800 --> 50:24.400
Tony, the reason I called,
about the other day...

50:26.200 --> 50:29.550
look, you can kid
around with me, okay?

50:29.585 --> 50:32.900
But not when the other
guys are there.

50:32.935 --> 50:35.617
I gotta maintain respect.

50:35.652 --> 50:38.300
No, I know.
You're the boss.

50:38.335 --> 50:39.965
Jesus.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.400
See you gotta be careful
what you say on this phone.

50:42.435 --> 50:45.600
It doesn't affect you,
but it affects me.

50:48.200 --> 50:51.400
Right.
I'm sorry.

50:54.800 --> 50:58.100
Is everything
good over there?

50:58.135 --> 51:01.365
You know, my mom's
on my case.

51:01.400 --> 51:04.800
Who'd have thought
we'd both be on our own again?

51:04.900 --> 51:07.400
Well, you can get back together
with Carm if you want.

51:07.500 --> 51:09.300
'Course she thinks
it's up to her

51:09.400 --> 51:11.100
and she goes from zero
to bitch every time

51:11.135 --> 51:13.100
I try to show
any warmth, you know?

51:13.135 --> 51:15.900
That's gotta be tough.

51:19.400 --> 51:22.600
Listen, Tony, I gotta
be up in two hours.

51:22.635 --> 51:24.600
So go to sleep.

51:24.700 --> 51:27.000
But you're my cousin
and my best friend.

51:27.100 --> 51:29.500
You gotta know
we could always talk.

51:29.600 --> 51:32.200
Yeah, well I'll buy
a fucking lunch box.

51:36.100 --> 51:38.800
All right, go to sleep,
go to sleep.

53:20.600 --> 53:23.265
We gotta talk about
my compensation overall.

53:23.300 --> 53:26.500
Interferon for my son's MS?
That's 20 a year now.

53:26.535 --> 53:28.367
Right. You said you
were gonna get us

53:28.402 --> 53:30.200
a making ceremony
which you didn't do.

53:30.300 --> 53:32.500
And here you are
asking for a raise.

53:32.535 --> 53:34.700
Can't you talk
to the higher-ups?

53:38.700 --> 53:41.600
Okay, we made
Vito Spatafore

53:41.700 --> 53:44.300
as running Ralph Cifaretto's
construction business.

53:44.335 --> 53:46.700
Has Chris ever
confirmed that?

53:56.400 --> 53:59.165
- You wanna know something?
- What?

53:59.200 --> 54:02.700
This girl, she's totally
ripping off her employer.

54:02.800 --> 54:05.600
Probably over 100 grand.

54:05.635 --> 54:07.365
What do you mean?

54:07.400 --> 54:10.000
Tina Francesco's
her name.

54:10.100 --> 54:12.865
She's a bookkeeper
for this furniture wholesaler.

54:12.900 --> 54:15.600
So she makes up vendors,
but she writes them real checks.

54:15.700 --> 54:18.600
Then her father cashes them.
Is that a federal crime?

54:18.700 --> 54:22.100
How many checks?
I mean, how much?

54:22.200 --> 54:25.000
Like I said, probably
over 100 grand.

54:27.200 --> 54:29.300
Tina?

54:29.400 --> 54:32.400
Francesco.

54:34.500 --> 54:36.800
The father's
name's Victor.

54:38.400 --> 54:41.600
It's Brettler
& Son's Imports.

55:17.900 --> 55:21.000
# Hear the screams

55:21.100 --> 55:24.600
# Loud enough to bust

55:26.100 --> 55:29.865
