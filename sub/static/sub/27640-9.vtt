WEBVTT

00:01.235 --> 00:02.634
(Crow caws, traffic rumbles)

00:05.106 --> 00:06.638
(Bat clunks)

00:07.708 --> 00:09.140
- Is today the baseball day?

00:09.176 --> 00:11.376
- Today was supposed to be
the baseball day, yes.

00:11.412 --> 00:13.579
- The finale?
- Championship.

00:13.714 --> 00:14.646
- Same thing.

00:14.782 --> 00:16.181
What time did you need me
to show up

00:16.183 --> 00:17.816
to watch you play the baseball?

00:17.818 --> 00:19.851
- Well, as of right now,
there you might be anything

00:19.920 --> 00:21.920
for you to watch.
- Oh?

00:22.055 --> 00:23.355
- Gwen dropped out.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.456
Apparently she has to go see

00:24.591 --> 00:26.792
a friend she met
on the internet, so...

00:26.927 --> 00:28.626
we are missing a right fielder.

00:28.662 --> 00:30.395
- Can you play both parts?

00:30.464 --> 00:32.864
- Positions. And, no.
That's the whole problem.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.666
We will forfeit the game

00:34.702 --> 00:36.201
if we can't come up
with a ninth player.

00:36.336 --> 00:39.338
- Well on the upside,
there is an Isabelle Huppert

00:39.473 --> 00:41.807
double feature playing
at the Elmdale Art House.

00:41.942 --> 00:43.008
- David, I can't bail
on the game,

00:43.143 --> 00:44.710
I just have to find
a ninth player.

00:44.845 --> 00:47.479
- Okay, well, good luck.
It sounds a bit last minute.

00:47.515 --> 00:49.181
- You know, they don't even
have to do anything,

00:49.250 --> 00:51.283
they pretty much just
stand there.

00:51.352 --> 00:52.818
- Have you asked Ronnie?

00:52.953 --> 00:54.620
- Uh, she is on the other team,

00:54.755 --> 00:56.488
and I'm pretty sure
she hates me

00:56.623 --> 00:58.957
after the bathroom incident.

00:58.959 --> 01:00.425
- Oh, I forgot about that.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.627
- Hey, you know what, David,
since you were already

01:02.696 --> 01:03.895
planning on being there,
maybe-maybe you...

01:03.897 --> 01:05.230
- Absolutely not!

01:05.266 --> 01:07.332
- Just two hours of your life.
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

01:07.401 --> 01:09.201
- We just need a body!
- Then go to the morgue.

01:09.336 --> 01:10.835
- I will cover you
if any flies come your way.

01:10.871 --> 01:12.036
- I have a spray for that.

01:12.073 --> 01:13.572
And you know my stance
on team sports.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.374
- I do. Given today's
political climate,

01:15.509 --> 01:16.975
we don't need to divide
ourselves any more

01:17.111 --> 01:18.577
than we already have.
- Correct.

01:18.712 --> 01:20.679
- Have I mentioned to you
that there will be a...

01:20.814 --> 01:22.915
barbecue after?

01:25.586 --> 01:26.752
- I have a couple questions.

01:26.887 --> 01:28.720
- How many of the questions
are about the barbecue?

01:28.856 --> 01:30.054
- Most of them.

01:30.091 --> 01:32.524
Like, how soon after the game
is the barbecue,

01:32.560 --> 01:33.925
and will the players get
to eat first,

01:33.961 --> 01:36.261
and if so, who's enforcing
that rule?

01:36.263 --> 01:37.929
- I love you, David.
- Okay. I...

01:37.998 --> 01:41.066
you say that now, but...
- Mm... muah!

01:41.068 --> 01:42.534
- I don't do well with running.

01:42.570 --> 01:44.202
- All right.

01:44.204 --> 01:48.740
♪♪♪

01:49.710 --> 01:51.809
- Ronnie, I don't know
what the big deal is!

01:51.846 --> 01:54.346
Nobody's gonna even notice
that Stevie's not at the game.

01:54.348 --> 01:56.081
- That's not the problem,
Roland.

01:56.150 --> 01:57.749
- I gotta be honest, sometimes
I don't even notice her

01:57.818 --> 01:59.484
when she's standing
right in front of me.

01:59.486 --> 02:01.352
- Roland, the rules say
that we can't play

02:01.388 --> 02:03.155
if we don't have nine players!

02:03.290 --> 02:06.090
And I can't stomach
the thought of Patrick's team

02:06.127 --> 02:08.426
winning by default;
the man looks like a thumb!

02:08.496 --> 02:10.428
- Ooh, Ronnie!

02:10.498 --> 02:13.365
I'm gonna need you to pour
a little of that picante sauce

02:13.500 --> 02:14.933
on the game today.

02:15.068 --> 02:17.369
Because my bookie, Lorenzo,
gave me great odds

02:17.371 --> 02:18.903
on us taking this.

02:18.905 --> 02:20.205
- There is not going
to be a game

02:20.274 --> 02:22.841
if we don't have a full team!
- Um, excuse me?

02:22.843 --> 02:25.043
I used to play a little
ball in my day.

02:25.179 --> 02:29.248
I was the star left fielder
from my school team.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.916
- You played college ball?

02:30.985 --> 02:32.050
- No, Hebrew school.

02:32.186 --> 02:34.252
There were seven of us,
surprisingly,

02:34.288 --> 02:36.121
not a big turn-out, but uh,

02:36.256 --> 02:38.590
the Flying Latkes ended up
in fourth place.

02:38.725 --> 02:40.859
- Johnny, I think some
things have changed

02:40.994 --> 02:43.462
since played ball, okay?

02:43.464 --> 02:45.697
For one thing, the war is over.
Ohhh!

02:45.733 --> 02:47.299
- Well, excuse me,
I thought you were in a bind,

02:47.434 --> 02:49.667
and needed a player, but uh,

02:49.703 --> 02:51.469
forget it, I'm taking
my offer back.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.538
- Roland, he's our only option.

02:53.540 --> 02:54.740
- No, he's not!

02:54.875 --> 02:56.875
Joce has a CPR dummy
that we can just throw

02:57.010 --> 02:58.877
out into left field.
- Roland!

02:58.946 --> 03:01.280
We're going with Johnny!
- Ah, boy.

03:01.415 --> 03:03.348
- Great!
And just so you know,

03:03.350 --> 03:05.617
I had a pretty strong arm
in the outfield.

03:05.752 --> 03:08.220
The Rabbi used to call me
"Popeye".

03:09.924 --> 03:11.089
<i> (Door slams)</i>

03:11.125 --> 03:13.825
- Okay... I am gonna give
Lorenzo a call,

03:13.961 --> 03:15.493
and change my bet.

03:15.529 --> 03:18.630
I'm gonna put everything I got
on the other team.

03:18.765 --> 03:20.899
- (Sighs heavily)

03:20.968 --> 03:22.434
- Hi Honey, is your Daddy home?

03:23.704 --> 03:24.870
(Car rumbles)

03:26.173 --> 03:27.706
- This is so exciting!

03:27.775 --> 03:29.907
I've never been
in a musical before.

03:29.944 --> 03:32.444
Although I did have a cousin
who was in "Riverdance"

03:32.513 --> 03:34.245
until she got trampled.

03:34.281 --> 03:37.048
- Yeah, um, I was one of
the original Pussycat Dolls,

03:37.084 --> 03:38.450
But I only lasted like,
two weeks.

03:38.452 --> 03:41.520
Because apparently,
I'm "too pretty".

03:41.655 --> 03:44.056
- (Squeals) This is gonna be
such a fun day!

03:44.058 --> 03:46.457
<i> Woman: Hey, Twyla!</i>

03:46.493 --> 03:47.793
- What about you, Stevie?

03:47.928 --> 03:51.129
I didn't even know that
you wanted to be an actor.

03:51.198 --> 03:54.299
- I don't.
- Fine, "artist".

03:54.434 --> 03:56.268
- I've been dreading
this rehearsal

03:56.403 --> 03:57.935
for the past two days.

03:57.972 --> 03:59.638
- Okay, as star of the show,

03:59.707 --> 04:02.374
you might wanna set like,
a different tone for everyone.

04:02.443 --> 04:04.909
- I think this is a huge
mistake.

04:04.945 --> 04:06.311
- You're not wrong.

04:06.313 --> 04:08.013
There has been a lot
of confusion as to why

04:08.148 --> 04:11.082
I'm not the star of the show,
but fair is fair.

04:11.151 --> 04:13.551
you earned it.
- No, I didn't.

04:13.621 --> 04:15.487
I didn't audition.

04:15.556 --> 04:18.156
I don't like attention.

04:18.158 --> 04:20.692
I can't think of anything worse

04:20.827 --> 04:22.694
than standing on a stage

04:22.763 --> 04:24.696
in front of a room
full of people.

04:24.831 --> 04:27.432
- Okay, Stevie, I think
you just need to chill.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.267
If this is anything
like my first day

04:29.336 --> 04:30.702
with the Pussycat Dolls,

04:30.738 --> 04:32.237
it'll be a couple of hours
of Kegels,

04:32.239 --> 04:34.572
and then an afternoon
of cheeky Bellinis.

04:34.642 --> 04:36.641
- It's just a lot of pressure.

04:36.644 --> 04:38.043
- Don't even worry about it.

04:38.178 --> 04:39.711
I got your back today, girl.

04:39.747 --> 04:42.781
Just like Nicole Scherzinger
did for me.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.282
- Willkommen and bienvenue,

04:44.285 --> 04:46.551
welcome, you... to "Cabaret!"

04:47.755 --> 04:49.187
- (Laughs and applauds)
- Not now, not yet.

04:49.256 --> 04:51.022
- Okay, mhmm.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.991
- I'm sure this will come
as a shock to all of you,

04:53.126 --> 04:56.395
but this production will
mark my directorial debut!

04:57.631 --> 04:59.231
- Mmm...

05:00.200 --> 05:03.235
- Oh. (Clapping)
(Cast applauds)

05:03.237 --> 05:05.069
- Missing cues already.

05:05.105 --> 05:08.006
No, I'm-I'm simply here
to inspire.

05:08.008 --> 05:11.543
And instruct, and bring out
the very best in you.

05:11.612 --> 05:13.745
And I want to start the day
with my lupanarian

05:13.747 --> 05:15.614
Kit Kat Girls!

05:15.749 --> 05:18.316
- We've also included anyone
who's requested extra

05:18.451 --> 05:21.453
rehearsal time to work
on their dance moves.

05:21.588 --> 05:23.488
- I just wanna limber up.

05:23.524 --> 05:26.758
There's some pretty tricky
footwork, so...

05:26.893 --> 05:30.095
- First, everyone, please,
direct your gaze...

05:30.097 --> 05:31.963
to the beating heart
of our show,

05:31.999 --> 05:35.166
our Sally Bowles, Miss Stevie...

05:35.235 --> 05:37.336
- Budd.
- Budd!

05:40.307 --> 05:43.642
You're wondering,
are we really going to lay

05:43.644 --> 05:47.678
this colossal enterprise
upon her tiny shoulders?

05:47.715 --> 05:49.714
Yes! I'm a 100% confident

05:49.750 --> 05:51.917
that you will all soon see
what I hope

05:52.052 --> 05:55.287
I believe I may be seeing
in you, Stevie.

05:55.422 --> 05:56.888
- Thank you.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.190
- As long as you're up,
why don't we jump right in?

05:59.259 --> 06:01.259
You can help me lead
the first exercise.

06:01.295 --> 06:03.862
- Uh, I thought this more of
a meet and greet kind of thing.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.397
- It's the afternoon upon which

06:05.532 --> 06:07.666
your bodies will meet
and greet...

06:07.668 --> 06:09.267
the boards.
- (Groans)

06:09.336 --> 06:11.402
- Okay, this is called...

06:11.438 --> 06:13.138
"Monster on my Back."

06:13.207 --> 06:14.572
- Oh, fuck.

06:14.608 --> 06:16.608
<i> (Fingers drumming)</i>

06:18.779 --> 06:20.645
(Door creaks)

06:23.384 --> 06:24.649
- Wow...

06:24.651 --> 06:27.351
- Okay, just so you're aware,

06:27.388 --> 06:28.687
I had a very cute,

06:28.689 --> 06:30.689
"my boyfriend's on the baseball
team" spectator look

06:30.824 --> 06:32.224
prepared for today,

06:32.226 --> 06:33.691
and now I'm wearing tap shoes.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.795
- They're called cleats,
and I think you look very cute.

06:36.864 --> 06:37.863
- That's a given.

06:37.865 --> 06:39.330
This just isn't how I pictured

06:39.400 --> 06:42.734
being a placeholder
rolling out.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.970
- Here. I thought we could
head outside,

06:45.105 --> 06:47.005
maybe throw the ball around
a little bit?

06:47.140 --> 06:49.373
- This glove is brown.
My shoes are black.

06:49.410 --> 06:51.176
What exactly are we doing here?

06:51.245 --> 06:53.344
- We're gonna practice?
- Practice what?!

06:53.380 --> 06:55.380
You told me I was just
a body in a field!

06:55.382 --> 06:57.015
- Hey, Patrick.
- Hey, Mr. Rose.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.350
- Whoa!
- What are you doing?!

06:58.485 --> 06:59.918
- Well, what are you doing?

06:59.920 --> 07:01.653
- Patrick's forcing me
to be on his team

07:01.788 --> 07:03.321
for the game today.
- Yeah.

07:03.390 --> 07:05.724
- Well, Roland and Ronnie
wanted me to be on their team

07:05.859 --> 07:07.925
for the game today.
- Oh my God!

07:07.961 --> 07:09.928
- That's funny, 'cause Ronnie's
been telling me all week

07:09.997 --> 07:11.930
how stacked her team is!

07:11.999 --> 07:13.799
So yeah, so this makes sense.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.934
- Oh. Well, David,
I'm surprised to see

07:15.936 --> 07:17.668
you back in a uniform.

07:17.704 --> 07:19.403
- Whoa, I'm sorry,
"back" in a uniform?

07:19.440 --> 07:20.905
- Okay, we don't need
to get into it.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.139
- He didn't tell you?

07:22.176 --> 07:24.141
Well, David holds
the Little League record

07:24.178 --> 07:26.010
for most times hit by a ball.

07:26.079 --> 07:28.146
- That's assuming it wasn't
intentional.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.948
They let me go home early.

07:30.083 --> 07:31.683
- So... where are you
putting him?

07:31.818 --> 07:33.084
- Right field.

07:33.153 --> 07:34.553
- Okay, well, I'll try
and get everyone

07:34.688 --> 07:36.354
to pull the ball to the left.

07:36.356 --> 07:38.089
- Well, thank you, Mr. Rose,

07:38.225 --> 07:39.624
but we're trying to keep
morale high.

07:39.759 --> 07:41.792
David and I are actually
just going outside

07:41.829 --> 07:43.428
to throw the ball around.
- Well, that sounds like fun.

07:43.563 --> 07:45.897
I think I'll oil up the glove
and join you.

07:45.933 --> 07:47.432
- Ew! Please don't.

07:47.567 --> 07:50.101
- Oh David, don't worry,
you'll be great.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.938
I just wish I'd kept
that helmet I got you.

07:56.777 --> 07:59.110
- Does this come in black?

07:59.179 --> 08:01.846
- You can use mine.

08:01.915 --> 08:02.981
Twyla: Once...

08:03.116 --> 08:04.249
- Once.

08:04.318 --> 08:07.752
- Uh no, we've moved on
from the mirror exercise.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.921
- Oh, okay, sorry. Go ahead.

08:09.957 --> 08:11.255
- Once...

08:11.291 --> 08:12.356
- At the motel...

08:12.392 --> 08:14.759
- One word at a time.

08:14.761 --> 08:16.961
- Okay.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.763
- Once...

08:21.268 --> 08:23.000
- Uh sorry,
I'm not good at this,

08:23.036 --> 08:24.402
I'm just not good at this, so.

08:24.438 --> 08:27.138
- Okay, um, maybe someone else
should jump in at this point.

08:27.140 --> 08:29.674
- Excellent idea, Alexis.
Okay, I'll play with Stevie.

08:29.809 --> 08:32.944
And perhaps we'll get a clearer
idea of what we need here.

08:33.079 --> 08:34.613
- Maybe you could do it
with somebody else though,

08:34.748 --> 08:36.748
let somebody else try.
- First word is a gimme.

08:36.817 --> 08:39.183
So you may say "once."

08:39.253 --> 08:41.786
- Once...
- Upon...

08:41.788 --> 08:43.621
- A...

08:43.657 --> 08:45.823
- Nightmare...
- My...

08:45.825 --> 08:47.292
- Captor...
- Was...

08:47.294 --> 08:49.160
- Dismembering...

08:49.229 --> 08:51.563
- Okay, does it always
get so dark?

08:51.698 --> 08:54.699
- Oh, I'm, I'm just flowing
with your energy, Stevie.

08:54.834 --> 08:56.201
Which is good, but...

08:56.336 --> 08:58.970
you may require a little
scordatura.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.838
Why don't I break us up
into groups.

09:00.840 --> 09:02.039
- That's a good idea,
'cause it's better

09:02.075 --> 09:04.109
than what's happening here.
- I'm glad you agree.

09:04.244 --> 09:07.279
- I'll... I'll number us off!
- Um, one, two.

09:08.949 --> 09:09.681
One, two.

09:11.785 --> 09:14.119
Two.

09:14.121 --> 09:15.987
Two... two, two.

09:16.122 --> 09:18.990
Jocelyn, take group two
for some movement exercises.

09:19.026 --> 09:20.258
- Mhmm.
- Thank you.

09:20.260 --> 09:22.627
- And you and I will do
a little more one on one.

09:24.364 --> 09:25.664
- Okay, hey!

09:25.799 --> 09:27.832
Do you think we could maybe
switch parts at this point?

09:27.834 --> 09:29.467
- Um, at this point I really
wouldn't want to.

09:29.603 --> 09:31.202
But if it makes you
feel better,

09:31.204 --> 09:33.270
I think lunch is soon.

09:33.307 --> 09:37.842
- Um, I'm just wondering when
the Bellinis are coming out?

09:37.878 --> 09:39.544
- (Kiss) Stay strong, babe.

09:39.546 --> 09:42.514
- Alexis, we don't need
to exercise our movement?

09:46.587 --> 09:48.353
Come here.

09:52.492 --> 09:54.492
- You ready?
- Uh, yeah.

09:55.596 --> 09:57.028
(Ball thuds)

09:57.064 --> 09:58.563
- Okay, next time,
can you make sure

09:58.698 --> 10:00.899
the ball goes into my glove?
Thanks so much.

10:01.034 --> 10:03.968
- It's a ground ball, David.
So in a game situation,

10:03.971 --> 10:05.837
it is possible that the ball
won't be hit

10:05.906 --> 10:07.906
directly into your glove.

10:07.908 --> 10:10.041
- How's it going, boys?
Do you mind if I toss a few?

10:10.077 --> 10:11.443
- That'd be great, Mr. Rose.

10:11.578 --> 10:13.178
That way I won't be the only
one chasing the ball

10:13.313 --> 10:15.246
every time I miss
David's glove.

10:15.248 --> 10:17.115
- Okay, the last thing
I need right now

10:17.250 --> 10:18.850
are two people coaching me
on something

10:18.919 --> 10:20.318
I didn't wanna do
in the first place.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.053
- Well, it's more for me, David.

10:22.089 --> 10:23.788
Popeye's arm isn't what
it used to be.

10:23.923 --> 10:25.657
- Nobody's gonna call you
Popeye.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.124
- Look alive, Patrick!

10:27.160 --> 10:28.927
(Truck rumbles)

10:28.929 --> 10:31.663
Roland: Whoa, hold it.

10:31.798 --> 10:34.198
Uh, Johnny?

10:34.234 --> 10:35.667
What are we doing here?

10:35.802 --> 10:37.135
- Just tossing the ball
around, Roland.

10:37.204 --> 10:40.071
No big deal.
- Wait, David's your sub?

10:40.107 --> 10:41.605
(Cackling)

10:41.642 --> 10:44.509
I thought you told me that
your team was stacked!

10:44.578 --> 10:46.644
- Good to see you too, Ronnie.
- Yeah...

10:46.647 --> 10:48.112
- Dave, be honest with me.

10:48.181 --> 10:50.682
Are you just playing to make
your dad look good?

10:50.751 --> 10:53.951
(Laughs) I may have to call
my bookie again, right?

10:53.987 --> 10:56.821
- Okay, this is passive
harassment.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.756
- Anyway, we just stopped by
to say we're having

10:58.792 --> 11:01.092
a little pre-game bevvy
and pep talk at my place

11:01.128 --> 11:02.960
if you want to join us, Johnny.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.295
- Well, I think I'll just
stick around,

11:04.364 --> 11:06.664
and loosen up a bit, Ronnie.

11:06.667 --> 11:08.166
- Johnny, I don't think
it's really ethical for you

11:08.301 --> 11:10.835
to be doing spring training
with the enemy.

11:10.970 --> 11:13.371
- He's not the enemy, Roland.
He's my son.

11:13.440 --> 11:16.774
- (Scoffs) There are no sons
in baseball!

11:16.810 --> 11:18.609
- What?

11:18.645 --> 11:20.144
- I'd argue most baseball
players are somebody's son.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.179
- So what does that make me?!
- Ohhhh!

11:22.215 --> 11:23.614
- No but, just 'cause he,
he said there's...

11:23.650 --> 11:24.883
- Yeah, you know what, good
luck.

11:24.885 --> 11:26.317
'Cause you all
are gonna need it.

11:26.453 --> 11:28.319
Yeah, I'm looking at you.
Roland: Yeah.

11:28.321 --> 11:30.288
- (Cackling)

11:31.725 --> 11:34.258
- Wow, she is really not a fan.

11:34.294 --> 11:36.194
- Ohh man, I wanna win
this game.

11:36.263 --> 11:38.196
- Okay, you told me
it was just for fun, though!

11:38.331 --> 11:39.997
- Well, it is for fun, David,

11:39.999 --> 11:42.533
but a little rivalry
is part of the fun.

11:42.569 --> 11:44.268
It's like when we used
to play the Catholic kids

11:44.337 --> 11:47.072
from Our Lady of Perpetual
Sorrow.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.507
The worst school cheer
I ever heard.

11:53.113 --> 11:55.947
(Jocelyn and actors
grunt and moan)

11:56.082 --> 11:57.649
All: Blaaah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

11:57.784 --> 11:59.951
- Let's be aware!

12:00.020 --> 12:03.488
There are two groups
in the room, voices carry.

12:03.490 --> 12:05.756
- Okay.

12:05.792 --> 12:07.625
- But this is actually
a good distraction for you.

12:07.627 --> 12:08.759
Because when you're on stage,

12:08.795 --> 12:11.029
you're going to have to drown
it all out.

12:11.031 --> 12:14.298
Okay, so let's now focus
on the image

12:14.367 --> 12:16.735
you were about to conjure
for me.

12:17.738 --> 12:19.838
- Okay...

12:19.973 --> 12:22.240
I'm in the Town Hall.

12:22.309 --> 12:24.809
I'm wearing my maroon
plaid hoodie.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.745
And I'm feeling...

12:27.781 --> 12:29.647
very uncomfortable.

12:29.783 --> 12:31.715
- Hmm, vivid.

12:31.752 --> 12:34.051
Visceral. Excellent, Stevie.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.921
Although the exercise
does ask us to recall

12:37.056 --> 12:40.124
a traumatic event in our life.

12:40.193 --> 12:42.060
This sounds almost
as if you're describing

12:42.195 --> 12:44.529
what's happening right now.

12:44.664 --> 12:46.931
- Well, I am.
- (Laughs) Oop!

12:47.000 --> 12:50.301
There's that razor sharp wit
that landed you the role.

12:50.370 --> 12:53.138
- Ah, Moira. Group two
is gonna take a fiver.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.139
I have not had
this much exercise

12:55.208 --> 12:57.208
since I birthed Roland Jr.

12:57.244 --> 12:58.943
- Look at you, Jocelyn!

12:58.945 --> 13:01.078
Pushing your authority
as assistant director

13:01.080 --> 13:02.546
to its limit.

13:02.582 --> 13:05.617
But Stevie and I are still
doing some memory sculpting.

13:05.619 --> 13:07.886
- Uh, Mrs. Rose, I think
I could really use

13:08.021 --> 13:10.354
a five minute break.
- Oh, Stevie.

13:10.390 --> 13:13.090
Okay, but we've chatted
30 seconds already,

13:13.092 --> 13:15.960
so we'll call it a company
four-and-a-half.

13:15.962 --> 13:17.361
- Okay.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.496
- Okay...

13:19.533 --> 13:22.833
(Actors murmur quietly)

13:22.869 --> 13:24.235
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.970
- So before I take my five,

13:25.972 --> 13:28.573
which technically won't start
until after this conversation,

13:28.642 --> 13:31.242
I just wanted to have
a conversation with you.

13:31.278 --> 13:32.644
It's about Stevie.

13:32.646 --> 13:36.414
- Oh Alexis, I can't say
I didn't see this coming.

13:36.416 --> 13:38.182
This must be very difficult
for you,

13:38.218 --> 13:40.718
watching one of your
contemporaries step in

13:40.720 --> 13:43.388
as Sally, when you fought
so hard for the role.

13:43.523 --> 13:45.590
- Oh my God, no!
I read the script,

13:45.659 --> 13:48.192
and never would've been able
to memorize those lines.

13:48.195 --> 13:51.563
- May I ask where your concern
lies, then?

13:52.599 --> 13:55.199
- This is all a little intense.

13:55.334 --> 13:57.836
- Hmm?
- Especially for Stevie.

13:58.872 --> 14:00.804
- If anything I'm going
easy on her.

14:00.841 --> 14:02.540
You should've seen
the conditioning

14:02.542 --> 14:04.275
Rocky put me through.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.210
Our first day consisted
of mud runs,

14:06.279 --> 14:08.746
and sob therapy!
- Okay.

14:08.782 --> 14:10.548
Well, she's not you,

14:10.683 --> 14:13.818
and I think she's actually
regretting signing up for this.

14:13.953 --> 14:15.887
And feels like
it was a big mistake.

14:15.889 --> 14:18.689
- Really? What gave you
that impression?

14:18.758 --> 14:21.759
- Because she told me that she
regrets signing up for this,

14:21.828 --> 14:23.628
and feels like
it was a big mistake.

14:23.763 --> 14:25.429
- That kind of attitude's
not going to get her

14:25.465 --> 14:26.965
very far as an actress.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.566
- Well, she's clearly not
an actress.

14:29.703 --> 14:32.369
You told us this morning that
you were here to inspire,

14:32.405 --> 14:34.706
instruct, and bring out
the best in all of us.

14:34.841 --> 14:38.543
- If only we needed to fill
the role of a Dictaphone!

14:38.678 --> 14:41.546
- I'm just saying.
- And your point is made.

14:42.649 --> 14:43.981
Thank you.

14:44.017 --> 14:45.717
Whatever's left
of the five minutes

14:45.852 --> 14:48.285
might do us all some good.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.355
Thank you.

15:01.268 --> 15:03.334
(Insects buzz)

15:03.336 --> 15:04.335
Patrick: All right now,
two away!

15:04.470 --> 15:05.937
All right, players to first
and second!

15:06.006 --> 15:09.007
Outfield in a little bit,
two away now, let's go!

15:09.009 --> 15:10.675
- Okay, I don't know
who this is,

15:10.677 --> 15:12.310
but can we put him back
in the box?

15:12.379 --> 15:14.411
Johnny: David, keep
your glove up!

15:14.447 --> 15:16.347
Protect your face!

15:16.383 --> 15:18.883
Roland: Hey, Johnny!
No coaching.

15:18.885 --> 15:20.818
- Always be ready!

15:20.854 --> 15:22.286
- Ugh!

15:22.322 --> 15:24.021
- Johnny, why don't you just
put on a little apron,

15:24.057 --> 15:26.357
and serve them the win
on a silver platter?!

15:26.492 --> 15:28.492
- I'm just helping out
my son, Roland.

15:28.528 --> 15:31.562
The kid has no idea
what he's doing!

15:31.564 --> 15:34.031
- I can hear you!

15:34.167 --> 15:36.867
- Okay, uh, Ronnie,
hit one out to right field.

15:37.003 --> 15:38.703
There's basically nobody
out there,

15:38.838 --> 15:41.272
Nobody's gonna catch it,
go ahead.

15:41.407 --> 15:43.207
(Metallic clink)

15:44.244 --> 15:46.778
(Grass rustles)

15:48.615 --> 15:51.816
Roland: You got this,
you got it!

15:51.818 --> 15:52.984
(Ball whooshes, bat clinks)

15:53.053 --> 15:54.919
Roland: Ohhh!
Johnny: You can do it, David!

15:54.921 --> 15:56.187
Patrick: Get out of the way,
David!

15:56.322 --> 15:58.990
(Ball thumps in glove)
It's okay, David, I got it.

15:58.992 --> 16:00.992
- Hey, you know what?!
It's not okay.

16:01.127 --> 16:02.192
I'm doing you the favour,

16:02.228 --> 16:04.261
you told me I was just a body
in a field,

16:04.397 --> 16:06.597
not a body that had
to catch things,

16:06.666 --> 16:08.465
flying very fast in the air!

16:08.501 --> 16:10.468
So...

16:10.537 --> 16:11.936
I'm out!

16:12.005 --> 16:13.804
- Well, actually, David,
uh, Ronnie's out,

16:13.840 --> 16:15.139
and the inning's over,
and technically,

16:15.175 --> 16:16.607
you're walking in the right
direction.

16:16.609 --> 16:18.409
- Well, that's good for you,
then, please get my glove.

16:20.513 --> 16:22.447
- Knock, knock!
- Team?

16:23.649 --> 16:26.717
- Um, a firefighter
with back pain?

16:26.753 --> 16:28.619
- No, try again.

16:29.823 --> 16:31.789
- Knock, knock!

16:32.859 --> 16:35.859
- A vacuum salesman?
I don't know.

16:35.895 --> 16:38.396
- Bob, try to communicate
what's written on the paper.

16:38.465 --> 16:41.099
- Is-is there a bell
I could ring?

16:41.234 --> 16:43.901
You know, I don't,
I don't wanna be rude,

16:43.970 --> 16:46.504
but uh, they could be
having dinner.

16:49.576 --> 16:52.043
- Um, you know, just keep
knocking until someone

16:52.178 --> 16:54.845
guesses what, or who you are.

16:54.914 --> 16:57.314
- Help me out here.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.616
Knock, knock.

16:58.751 --> 17:01.151
- Yes, let's you and I sit
this one out, shall we?

17:01.187 --> 17:03.187
End things on a lighter note.

17:03.223 --> 17:05.656
It is called a "play",
not a "work".

17:05.658 --> 17:08.258
<i> Jocelyn: Someone caught</i>
<i> in the rain!</i>

17:08.294 --> 17:10.328
- Um, Mrs. Rose?

17:10.463 --> 17:11.695
I've been thinking...

17:11.765 --> 17:13.097
- Oh, that's your first mistake.

17:13.233 --> 17:16.967
Don't think, Stevie,
just trust your instincts.

17:17.037 --> 17:19.837
- Okay... well, my instincts
are telling me

17:20.940 --> 17:23.374
that I'm in over my head.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.676
- See, deciphering which
instincts to trust

17:25.745 --> 17:27.812
that's the real skill.

17:27.814 --> 17:30.214
You're feeling overwhelmed.
- (Laughs nervously)

17:30.250 --> 17:32.650
- After some quiet reflection,

17:32.652 --> 17:34.952
it occurred to me that
this morning's exercises

17:35.021 --> 17:37.621
might've been a bit advanced.

17:37.657 --> 17:40.224
Please remember, this is all
new to me as well.

17:40.359 --> 17:42.926
<i> Alexis: Ooh! A guy that works</i>
<i> with animals, but not a vet...</i>

17:42.962 --> 17:45.696
- (Laughs shyly)
- We're in this together.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.098
- Okay...

17:47.100 --> 17:49.433
- Might I share with you
an anecdote about my director--

17:49.502 --> 17:51.402
- A man with amnesia!
- Yes!

17:51.537 --> 17:53.237
Well, he may have a story
or two about that

17:53.306 --> 17:54.639
from his later years.

17:54.774 --> 17:56.240
- No, sorry, I mean, the game.

17:56.309 --> 17:58.342
It-he's a man with amnesia!

17:58.344 --> 18:01.846
- Yes! Oh, I'm so glad
somebody figured it out!

18:02.849 --> 18:05.983
Oh, I actually forgot what
I was supposed to do up here!

18:06.019 --> 18:07.784
Jocelyn: (Laughs)
- Ohh!

18:07.821 --> 18:09.320
- You know that you have
to come up

18:09.322 --> 18:11.522
and play the game now, right?

18:13.126 --> 18:14.826
- I think I can handle that.

18:16.662 --> 18:18.396
- (Clapping quietly)

18:18.531 --> 18:20.164
- Ohhh...
- Thanks.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.933
(Alexis clears throat)

18:23.002 --> 18:24.168
(Scoffs)

18:27.974 --> 18:29.206
(Rapid exhales)

18:29.208 --> 18:30.942
- Vampire person!

18:31.077 --> 18:33.177
Twyla: Oh! Ghost!
Ghost girl!

18:33.213 --> 18:34.678
Hemophiliac!

18:34.814 --> 18:36.414
- Woman with amnesia!

18:36.416 --> 18:38.982
- No!

18:39.018 --> 18:40.451
- Hey! Patrick.

18:42.055 --> 18:43.621
I don't mean to put
any pressure on you,

18:43.690 --> 18:45.890
but you do realize that
it's the bottom of the ninth,

18:45.892 --> 18:47.891
two out, bases are loaded,

18:47.927 --> 18:49.693
and the game's on the line,
right?

18:49.729 --> 18:51.428
- Yeah, I realize that,
thank you, Ronnie.

18:51.498 --> 18:53.197
- So, who's up?

18:53.266 --> 18:54.499
- Oh, I think you know who's up.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.367
- (Cackling)

18:56.502 --> 18:57.968
- The barbecue guy wasn't ready,

18:58.004 --> 18:59.270
but he gave me some chips.

18:59.405 --> 19:01.205
- Okay David, you're up,
but I'm gonna talk to the ump

19:01.207 --> 19:02.974
and see if we can
pinch hit for you.

19:02.976 --> 19:04.775
- Why? It's the only part
of this stupid game

19:04.777 --> 19:06.544
that I'm actually good at.

19:06.613 --> 19:08.646
- Well, you struck out
three times, so...

19:08.715 --> 19:11.082
- I tipped it that one time,
you even admitted that!

19:11.217 --> 19:13.918
- No, that's true, and that
was a-that was a great tip.

19:13.987 --> 19:16.187
It's just that we're trying
to win here.

19:16.189 --> 19:18.589
- Hey! Hey! Do we have
a batter, or what?!

19:18.625 --> 19:20.257
What's going on?
- Yeah, I'm doing it.

19:20.293 --> 19:22.927
I'm doing the batting.
- Ohhh, okay, great!

19:22.929 --> 19:24.829
All right!
- Okay.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.931
- Easy out everyone,
easy out!

19:27.066 --> 19:28.666
(Chuckles)

19:28.735 --> 19:30.935
Fire up the grill, we'll be
there in a couple of seconds!

19:30.937 --> 19:32.736
- Okay, everyone shut up!

19:32.805 --> 19:34.605
Ronnie, throw the thing.

19:39.579 --> 19:41.545
(Ball whooshes, bat thwacks)
- Unh!

19:41.681 --> 19:43.447
Patrick: Oh my God!
Run, David, run!

19:43.449 --> 19:45.882
- Way to go, son! (Laughs)
Patrick: All right, David!

19:45.919 --> 19:47.752
Roland: Johnny! Get the ball!

19:47.887 --> 19:49.487
Patrick: This is it!
Go, David! Drop the bat!

19:49.622 --> 19:51.822
Ronnie: What are you waiting
for, Johnny?

19:51.824 --> 19:53.157
Roland: Come on, he's going
home!

19:53.292 --> 19:55.058
Patrick: All the way, David!
All the way!

19:55.094 --> 19:56.727
(Ball thunks)
- Aaaah!

19:56.796 --> 19:59.229
Umpire: Safe!
Green Team: Yeaaaaah!

19:59.265 --> 20:01.699
- Are you okay?
- Did I do it?

20:01.768 --> 20:03.534
- You did it.

20:03.603 --> 20:05.303
You did it!

20:05.438 --> 20:08.305
(Applause, cheering)
- Wooo!

20:08.341 --> 20:10.007
Woo!

20:10.142 --> 20:11.842
Johnny: (Laughs)
(Laughing and cheering)

20:11.878 --> 20:13.978
Patrick: David Rose,
hit the ball!

20:14.047 --> 20:16.113
- (Laughs)

20:16.115 --> 20:17.982
- Ohhh!

20:18.117 --> 20:20.918
Wooooo!
- Woo! That's my boy!

20:25.058 --> 20:26.557
(Rock music plays)

20:27.927 --> 20:29.660
- You know, Johnny,
the next time I need a sub,

20:29.662 --> 20:33.464
remind me to ask the blind goat
over at Mrs. Divine's farm.

20:33.599 --> 20:35.433
- It's just a game, Roland.

20:35.568 --> 20:38.002
- Popeye smokes his son
square in the back.

20:38.071 --> 20:40.071
- It was a quick recovery,
Ronnie,

20:40.073 --> 20:41.405
but thanks for the play-by-play.

20:41.540 --> 20:44.207
- Well, luckily for me,
I had a side bet

20:44.244 --> 20:46.877
on whether Johnny would throw
the game in his kid's favour.

20:46.879 --> 20:48.479
I consider it a split.

20:48.548 --> 20:50.615
- When you get hit in the back
playing a game

20:50.750 --> 20:52.349
you never wanted to play
in the first place,

20:52.485 --> 20:54.084
does that make you the VIP?

20:54.153 --> 20:55.820
- The MVP, and uh, no,
we're not doing that.

20:55.955 --> 20:57.821
- Okay, what if we were
doing it, though?

20:57.857 --> 20:59.490
- Well then, you would
definitely be the VIP.

20:59.625 --> 21:01.025
- Okay.

21:01.027 --> 21:03.427
- Listen, I'm sorry if this
game sorta unleashed

21:03.562 --> 21:04.961
my competitive side.

21:04.998 --> 21:06.697
- Yeah, we really don't need
to meet him again.

21:06.832 --> 21:08.165
- But, you know,
part of me wonders,

21:08.234 --> 21:09.967
would you have hit
a home run

21:10.102 --> 21:11.769
if I hadn't lit that fire
in you?

21:11.904 --> 21:13.904
Because I have never seen you
run like that.

21:13.906 --> 21:16.173
- Yeah, it was mainly because
I was smelling the barbeque.

21:16.175 --> 21:18.576
- Ah.
- Up. Higher.

21:18.711 --> 21:20.011
- Okay.
- Thank you.
