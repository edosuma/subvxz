We know you've been
sleeping with Gabe's dad.

00:11.112 --> 00:12.011
If you don't
divorce Elizabeth,

00:12.013 --> 00:15.014
then I will let you
write your book.

00:17.650 --> 00:18.584
So you'd already
written it.

00:18.586 --> 00:23.522
And that whole speech about
fatherly truth-telling...

00:23.524 --> 00:25.024
that was a lie?

00:25.026 --> 00:25.924
Yes.

00:25.926 --> 00:28.627
I need my bank
to cover some debts.

00:28.629 --> 00:29.294
You're his bank?

00:29.296 --> 00:31.830
Here, don't say your bank
didn't do anything for you.

00:31.832 --> 00:33.332
What am I
supposed to do with it?

00:33.334 --> 00:35.067
Sell it, pawn it.

00:35.069 --> 00:36.735

you wanna do this?

00:36.737 --> 00:40.039

I want it to be perfect.

00:40.041 --> 00:41.173
I miss her.

00:41.175 --> 00:41.974
I'll find her for you.

00:41.976 --> 00:43.342
I believe you have
a necklace of mine.

00:43.344 --> 00:46.545
No, I don't.
But you're wearing
my bracelet.

00:46.547 --> 00:49.348
She gave this to me.

00:49.350 --> 00:50.349
Did you give
that to her?

00:50.351 --> 00:51.984
Hands behind
your back please.

00:51.986 --> 00:53.385
Bird, tell them!

00:53.387 --> 00:54.153
What-- You...

00:54.155 --> 00:56.955
Could you just tell me
what this looks like?

00:56.957 --> 00:57.556
It's bad.

00:57.558 --> 01:00.359
Did Crash
put you up to this?

01:00.361 --> 01:02.761
Between you
and your husband, I--

01:02.763 --> 01:04.897
I think I might actually
be better off in here.

01:04.899 --> 01:06.799
It seems my daughter
stole my necklace

01:06.801 --> 01:08.100
and blamed your daughter.

01:08.102 --> 01:09.668
I've dropped all charges
against Carter.

01:09.670 --> 01:12.504
I'm here to pick up Carter--
No, Liz, Crash came by.

01:12.506 --> 01:16.241
Some idiot clerk allowed him
to post bail for her.

'cause I was a purple belt.

12:40.894 --> 12:41.259
Yeah.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.961
But when they started
throwing the moon-pies

12:42.963 --> 12:46.331
and I ask them to stop,
then they look at me like,

12:46.333 --> 12:47.565
"Hey, man,
do you Kung Fu?"

12:47.567 --> 12:52.137
And so I said, "Do you think
that's air you're breathing?"

12:52.139 --> 12:54.072
Thanks for
making me laugh.

12:54.074 --> 12:56.875
You know what else
I was thinking?

12:56.877 --> 12:59.010
What?

13:07.119 --> 13:08.520
(chuckles)

13:11.657 --> 13:14.058
Is this for me?

13:14.060 --> 13:14.559
Mm-hmm.

13:14.561 --> 13:17.228
So, I can-- I can
come here all the time

13:17.230 --> 13:17.762
whenever I want.

13:17.764 --> 13:20.799
All the time,
whenever you want.

13:20.801 --> 13:23.768
And we can
lay on the couch.

13:23.770 --> 13:25.303
Mm-hmm.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.505
I'll cook you food.

13:27.507 --> 13:29.674
Ramen.

13:32.545 --> 13:35.980
I wish I could call Carter
and tell her about it.

13:35.982 --> 13:39.818
Trust me,
she'll be back soon.

13:53.299 --> 13:55.867
(door shuts)

14:02.141 --> 14:04.342
Hey.
Hey.

14:04.743 --> 14:08.313
They never fixed the lock
on the back window.

14:14.820 --> 14:16.521
Hey, this could work.

14:16.523 --> 14:19.524
This is good,
we could use this.

14:19.526 --> 14:20.859
Yeah, we could
probably stay here

14:20.861 --> 14:23.528
until we find a new spot.

14:28.667 --> 14:30.969
Is it weird being back?

14:33.105 --> 14:34.072
Yeah.

14:34.074 --> 14:38.676
This is really different
without all our furniture.

14:38.678 --> 14:42.280
Okay, tell me.

14:42.282 --> 14:43.982
What was over here?

14:43.984 --> 14:45.049
Over here?
Uh-huh.

14:45.051 --> 14:49.153
Um, over there was this big,
old couch that we had

14:49.155 --> 14:51.322
that we bought
at a flew market.

14:51.324 --> 14:54.626
All of our furniture
was from flea markets.

14:54.628 --> 14:57.996
Okay, what about
in front of the window?

14:57.998 --> 15:00.465
Uh-- Oh, that
was where we, um,

15:00.467 --> 15:02.567
we put the Christmas tree
every year.

15:02.569 --> 15:03.568
'Cause my mom always
wanted the neighbors

15:03.570 --> 15:06.704
to be able to see it
when they walked past.

15:06.706 --> 15:08.239
Okay, what about here?

15:08.241 --> 15:09.807
Over here
was our dining room.

15:09.809 --> 15:12.110
That-- It was just where
my mom kept all of her books.

15:12.112 --> 15:14.279
And, um, she had these
three wicker baskets

15:14.281 --> 15:15.513
full of yarn
right over there.

15:15.515 --> 15:18.149
She would always try to
teach me how to knit.

15:18.151 --> 15:20.151
Wait, you know
how to knit?

15:20.153 --> 15:22.787
No, I still can't do it.

15:24.356 --> 15:27.225
Oh, and my height chart!

15:27.227 --> 15:28.793
Look.

15:28.795 --> 15:30.295
Your what?

15:30.297 --> 15:31.663
You never had
a height chart?

15:31.665 --> 15:32.597
You know,
when your mom, like,

15:32.599 --> 15:33.665
makes you stand up
against the wall

15:33.667 --> 15:34.866
and then, like,
measures your height,

15:34.868 --> 15:36.367
and you can see
how much you grow?

15:36.369 --> 15:37.669
No?
Sorry.

15:37.671 --> 15:40.505
Oh! All right, well,
let's do it now.

15:40.507 --> 15:42.774
Stand up
against the wall.

15:42.776 --> 15:44.776
(laughs)
I'm sorry.

15:44.778 --> 15:46.811
Okay, move back.

15:49.848 --> 15:52.517
I can't even reach.

15:52.519 --> 15:54.352
Come back.

15:56.755 --> 15:58.356
So, that's you now,

15:58.358 --> 16:00.758
and the last time
my mom measured me,

16:00.760 --> 16:02.593
I was here.

16:08.434 --> 16:10.468
What?

16:10.470 --> 16:11.469
This is new.

16:11.471 --> 16:12.870
This wasn't here before.

16:12.872 --> 16:14.105
My mom wrote this.

16:14.107 --> 16:15.173
Well, how do you know?

16:15.175 --> 16:15.974
That's her handwriting.

16:15.976 --> 16:17.642
That's how she does
her sevens.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.043
Okay, what is it?

16:19.045 --> 16:22.080

but I'm gonna write it down.

love to do that.

25:16.282 --> 25:19.350
I can't stay, Max.

25:23.321 --> 25:27.525
I'll get you
some burner phones.

25:27.527 --> 25:29.527
Come on, Max.

25:30.962 --> 25:32.696
(groans)

25:33.732 --> 25:36.467
Have you heard from her?

25:38.303 --> 25:40.304
No.

25:44.276 --> 25:46.377
Maybe she's gone for good.

25:47.078 --> 25:51.448
If you're not careful,
that's what you're about to be.

25:51.450 --> 25:52.583
You know,
you gotta think about

25:52.585 --> 25:56.186
that apple falling far
from the tree thing.

25:57.255 --> 26:00.024
She's not your tree.

26:04.796 --> 26:05.763
Come on, Max.

26:05.765 --> 26:08.232
Max, mind your own
business, Max.

26:08.234 --> 26:11.335
(whispering)
Come on, Max.

26:12.437 --> 26:13.971
Why don't you like him?

26:13.973 --> 26:16.707
Seriously, what has he ever
really done to hurt you?

26:16.709 --> 26:20.044
For starters, he's--
he's taking you away.

26:20.046 --> 26:24.848
(door opens, chimes)

26:24.850 --> 26:26.850
Hey.

26:28.386 --> 26:30.854
Hey, Max.

26:30.856 --> 26:32.222
How are you?

26:32.224 --> 26:33.824
Pretty good.

26:36.561 --> 26:40.864
Aren't you gonna
ask me how I am?

26:40.866 --> 26:43.434
How are you, Crash?

26:44.569 --> 26:45.669
I think you know.

26:45.671 --> 26:47.037
Okay, well,
I'm about done here.

26:47.039 --> 26:48.539
And I know you want to go,
so let's just

26:48.541 --> 26:50.074
leave Max to his job--
No, no, hold on.

26:50.076 --> 26:51.175
Give us one second.

26:51.177 --> 26:53.010
While I was sitting
out there thinking,

26:53.012 --> 26:53.711
I had an idea.

26:53.713 --> 26:55.446
Thought of a way
that you could help us.

26:55.448 --> 26:58.148
Max, you want to
help us, right?

26:58.150 --> 27:00.517
Well, I mean, I know
you want to help Carter.

27:00.519 --> 27:02.019
No, come on, look,
he's done enough.

27:02.021 --> 27:02.820
Let's just leave him--

27:02.822 --> 27:05.255
Yeah, so he can do
this one last thing.

27:05.257 --> 27:08.425
One last thing.

27:08.427 --> 27:09.994
(sighs)

27:09.996 --> 27:11.729
This is easy.

27:11.731 --> 27:13.697
Give us everything
in the register.

27:13.699 --> 27:15.032
Report it as a robbery.

27:15.034 --> 27:17.468
Dude, that's not happening.

27:17.470 --> 27:20.237
Just tell the cops
you had a gun in your face.

27:20.239 --> 27:21.138
Get the hell out
of my store.

27:21.140 --> 27:25.409
Yeah, I'm trying, I just--
I just need the money.

27:25.411 --> 27:26.010
The money.

27:26.012 --> 27:27.478
Crash, what the hell
are you doing?

27:27.480 --> 27:29.980
Carter, the safety's on.

27:29.982 --> 27:32.282
See--

27:49.100 --> 27:51.902
(Carter's voice
echoing, distorted)
What did you do?

27:51.904 --> 27:55.105
What did you do?

28:04.049 --> 28:05.215
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.

28:05.217 --> 28:07.618

I didn't mean to.

28:10.656 --> 28:12.990
