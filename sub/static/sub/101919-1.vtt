03:29.657 --> 03:30.831
Hello?

03:49.539 --> 03:50.747
JP?

03:53.336 --> 03:54.751
Vivian?

04:51.877 --> 04:56.537
I don't like people
photographing my family.

04:56.641 --> 05:00.403
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to confiscate that camera...

05:01.542 --> 05:03.717
and then strangle you to death.

05:07.583 --> 05:08.929
JP.

05:11.276 --> 05:13.036
Francis.

05:15.384 --> 05:17.420
JP.

05:18.904 --> 05:20.803
Francis.

05:22.356 --> 05:24.047
JP.

05:25.670 --> 05:27.499
Francis.

05:29.121 --> 05:30.744
JP.

05:32.262 --> 05:33.781
Francis.

05:52.317 --> 05:54.457
You look exactly the same.

05:54.561 --> 05:57.218
Only you look like
you're going on a safari.

05:57.322 --> 05:59.117
I feel like
I'm going on a safari.

05:59.220 --> 06:01.775
Well, the animals here
tend to stay in their dens.

06:01.878 --> 06:03.673
This really
is quite a place, JP.

06:03.777 --> 06:05.917
Oh, gosh, you don't know
the half of it.

06:06.020 --> 06:08.540
It's very much like
you've entered a dream,

06:08.644 --> 06:10.266
for better or worse.

06:10.370 --> 06:13.303
It was my grandma's on the Luret
side originally, Dad's mom.

06:13.407 --> 06:15.892
Her paintings are all over.

06:16.962 --> 06:18.723
- You told me on the phone.
- I'm sure I did.

06:18.826 --> 06:21.277
I've been having a problem
with my short-term memory.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.727
Is that part
of your condition?

06:22.830 --> 06:24.038
It's strange, you know,

06:24.142 --> 06:26.075
I can remember all these things
from way back,

06:26.178 --> 06:27.973
only sometimes I don't know
if I'm remembering

06:28.077 --> 06:31.425
something that actually happened
or remembering a dream.

06:31.529 --> 06:32.599
Oh, gosh.

06:32.702 --> 06:34.186
What's the matter?

06:34.290 --> 06:36.844
Would you mind taking your shoes
off before we go any further?

06:36.948 --> 06:37.811
Oh geez, I'm sorry.

06:37.914 --> 06:40.952
It's perfectly alright,
really.

06:41.055 --> 06:42.988
I don't think
I tracked anything in.

06:43.092 --> 06:44.818
I wouldn't care if you did.

06:44.921 --> 06:46.095
Oh.

06:46.198 --> 06:48.131
Uh, where should I put them?

06:52.860 --> 06:55.035
- Not bad.

06:55.138 --> 06:57.589
Tell you the truth,
I always get a bit anxious

06:57.693 --> 07:00.040
when people have
their shoes on in the house.

07:00.143 --> 07:02.422
It always feels like
they're about to leave.

07:02.525 --> 07:04.562
And you just got here.

07:04.665 --> 07:06.564
Lot of shoes in there.

07:08.289 --> 07:09.705
The shoe cave.

07:09.808 --> 07:11.707
Now I just need
to spin around ten times

07:11.810 --> 07:13.950
so that the world
doesn't end in flames.

07:25.065 --> 07:27.067
I can't believe
it's been ten years.

07:27.170 --> 07:28.827
Mm, my father's memorial.

07:30.277 --> 07:31.692
Sorry I didn't keep in touch.

07:31.796 --> 07:33.970
My fault as much as yours.

07:35.316 --> 07:38.975
It's funny, I hope this doesn't
sound too strange, but...

07:40.252 --> 07:42.496
you're in my dreams quite a lot.

07:48.260 --> 07:50.159
You're in my dreams, too.

07:52.402 --> 07:56.165
Usually, it's you and me
and Vivian...

07:58.339 --> 08:00.134
in some house somewhere.

08:01.791 --> 08:03.241
Well, here we are.

08:05.830 --> 08:07.487
What made you decide to call?

08:09.281 --> 08:10.593
Believe it or not,

08:10.697 --> 08:13.285
I suddenly remembered
watching a war movie with you.

08:13.389 --> 08:15.667
- Which one?
- I can't remember,

08:15.771 --> 08:18.359
but there was a young man
dying in another man's arms,

08:18.463 --> 08:20.396
and there was that feeling
of brotherhood

08:20.500 --> 08:21.915
that I've never
completely understood

08:22.018 --> 08:24.814
but have always been
very moved by.

08:24.918 --> 08:27.334
Anyway, I realized
I no longer had that in my life,

08:27.437 --> 08:29.129
and I wanted to cry.

08:31.821 --> 08:34.341
What made you say yes?

08:34.444 --> 08:37.206
Well, gosh, when you said
you needed help,

08:37.309 --> 08:38.966
it was hard to say no.

08:41.486 --> 08:43.937
It means a lot
to hear you say that.

08:46.871 --> 08:48.666
You caught me at a good time.

08:51.220 --> 08:53.878
Anyway, I was excited
to reconnect.

08:54.913 --> 08:56.190
Me too.

08:56.294 --> 08:59.573
It's just me and Vivian now,
you know. That's it.

09:00.781 --> 09:02.680
That's the Luret family.

09:02.783 --> 09:04.544
Where is Vivian?

09:07.408 --> 09:10.066
She might be worse off
than I am.

09:10.170 --> 09:11.551
Is Vivian sick, too?

09:11.654 --> 09:14.243
She hasn't been right
since Dad died.

09:14.346 --> 09:16.348
And if she's down, I'm down.

09:17.660 --> 09:20.180
That's how twins work,
you know?

09:20.283 --> 09:23.183
- Are you gonna be alright?
- Tell you truth...

09:25.012 --> 09:29.776
I've never been able to half-way
imagine myself in my old age.

09:35.160 --> 09:37.369
Depression's always been
the family evil.

09:39.061 --> 09:42.133
All the money you could need
and no peace at all.

09:42.236 --> 09:44.618
Now, Viv and I aren't connecting
like we used to.

09:44.722 --> 09:47.483
I think she's tired of me.

09:47.587 --> 09:50.003
Maybe I squeeze too tight.

09:50.106 --> 09:52.350
Anyway, now I have you
to connect with.

09:52.453 --> 09:54.870
I'm all yours.

09:54.973 --> 09:57.942
Although it wouldn't be
a very satisfying safari

09:58.045 --> 09:59.909
without a Vivian sighting.

10:00.634 --> 10:01.946
Yeah, well.

10:04.293 --> 10:06.536
Incidentally, I wouldn't get
too close to her room,

10:06.640 --> 10:08.228
unless you want
to get clawed to death.

10:08.331 --> 10:09.954
That dangerous, huh?

10:10.057 --> 10:12.197
No, I mean it.

10:17.858 --> 10:19.273
Don't bother her.

10:20.689 --> 10:23.174
I should see
if she wants some coffee.

10:25.072 --> 10:28.386
Listen, I was thinking of making
brats and spaetzle tonight.

10:35.082 --> 10:37.291
I thought you were going
to say that.

10:38.948 --> 10:40.881
Or, well, I hoped you
were going to say that.

10:40.985 --> 10:42.814
I'll run out,
and get what we need.

10:42.918 --> 10:44.126
No, there's no need.

10:44.229 --> 10:46.093
I have everything.
I had it delivered.

10:46.197 --> 10:48.889
You can have practically
anything delivered here.

10:48.993 --> 10:51.167
We never have
to leave this place.

10:56.586 --> 10:59.520
- It's me.

11:08.460 --> 11:10.014
- Vivian!

11:10.842 --> 11:13.569
Do not behave this way.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.433
You can live with that
on the floor.

11:15.536 --> 11:18.229
That was grandma's
French porcelain, you bitch!

11:18.332 --> 11:21.404
I want to know how things
are really going.

11:22.405 --> 11:23.475
Not good.

11:23.579 --> 11:25.305
- Money troubles?
- Oh, sure.

11:25.408 --> 11:26.927
Are you homeless?

11:28.653 --> 11:30.690
Not exactly.

11:30.793 --> 11:32.312
Where are you keeping
your belongings?

11:32.415 --> 11:35.418
- In a storage unit in Burbank.
- Burbank?

11:36.903 --> 11:39.802
You've not had the same lap
to fall into as I have.

11:39.906 --> 11:41.735
I forget that.

11:43.426 --> 11:46.291
Listen, you've got to promise
not judge me too harshly

11:46.395 --> 11:48.362
when I tell you this,

11:48.466 --> 11:52.712
but I haven't stepped foot
outside this place in two years.

11:53.643 --> 11:55.576
Two years?

11:55.680 --> 11:58.200
Well, it's a nasty world,
you know?

11:58.303 --> 12:00.374
I mean,
it's beautiful for sure,

12:00.478 --> 12:03.136
but it's too nasty.

12:03.239 --> 12:06.760
Just the other morning, I read
that a man walked into a cafÃ©

12:06.864 --> 12:09.211
and started killing people
with a hammer,

12:09.314 --> 12:12.317
at random.

12:12.421 --> 12:15.942
It's senseless out there, and
I don't want to be part of it.

12:17.978 --> 12:20.360
You sound like
a 100-year-old man.

12:21.154 --> 12:23.466
I am an old man in many ways.

12:26.780 --> 12:28.713
I've figured out
what I want with my time,

12:28.817 --> 12:31.336
and it's being here.

12:31.440 --> 12:34.719
When I walk in this garden,
I feel like a boy again,

12:34.823 --> 12:37.273
and I remember
the smell of things.

12:38.999 --> 12:41.968
And it's even stronger
with you around.

12:49.872 --> 12:52.772
I really hope
you stay for a while.

13:48.897 --> 13:50.553
Viv?

13:53.418 --> 13:55.075
Get out of here,

13:55.179 --> 13:58.285
or you'll die
with the rest of us.

14:24.208 --> 14:26.900
I shuffle a deck
when I'm restless.

14:29.765 --> 14:31.422
I just saw Vivian.

14:46.230 --> 14:47.472
Viv?

15:05.421 --> 15:07.044
Like a log.

15:08.769 --> 15:09.943
I'm not crazy.

15:10.047 --> 15:11.600
She does sleepwalk.

15:11.703 --> 15:14.051
- That must have been it.
- Yeah, or, you know,

15:14.154 --> 15:16.398
maybe you were sort of
dreaming yourself.

15:16.501 --> 15:18.055
Come on, JP.

15:18.158 --> 15:19.953
Are you awake right now?

15:20.057 --> 15:21.817
Yeah, of course I'm awake.

15:21.921 --> 15:25.096
Look, she was dripping wet.

15:35.969 --> 15:39.110
Francis,
you've had an accident.

15:41.595 --> 15:43.252
This is you.

15:44.357 --> 15:47.015
Are you sure
you're awake right now?

15:49.776 --> 15:51.812
I think so.

15:51.916 --> 15:53.676
Hmm.

15:55.713 --> 15:59.475
I'll be interested to see if you
remember this in the morning.

16:19.771 --> 16:22.153
It's some sort of litany.

16:26.261 --> 16:28.642
It's beautiful, isn't it?

16:29.540 --> 16:32.646
I don't even know
what she's saying.

16:37.962 --> 16:40.344
Is that for me?

16:40.447 --> 16:42.415
I was going to make
something more elaborate,

16:42.518 --> 16:45.487
then I remembered you like
nothing more in the world

16:45.590 --> 16:47.213
than buttered toast.

16:47.316 --> 16:49.767
- Mm!
- If that's still true.

16:49.870 --> 16:51.596
Yes, it is.

16:55.738 --> 16:56.739
I've got good news.

16:56.843 --> 16:58.396
They can bring your stuff here
from Burbank.

16:58.500 --> 17:01.123
We'll just throw it
in the workshop.

17:04.092 --> 17:05.334
How is that?

17:07.336 --> 17:09.131
They're bringing
my stuff here?

17:09.235 --> 17:11.340
It's already taken care of.

17:14.930 --> 17:17.760
Well... gosh, I don't mean
to be confrontational,

17:17.864 --> 17:19.590
but I wish you'd have
brought it up with me first.

17:19.693 --> 17:21.419
Yeah, but then
it wouldn't be a surprise,

17:21.523 --> 17:23.559
and now you can just
pocket that monthly fee.

17:30.187 --> 17:32.534
- How'd you sleep?
- Not that well.

17:39.644 --> 17:41.060
Did you talk to Viv?

17:41.163 --> 17:42.544
About what?

17:42.647 --> 17:44.063
About last night.

17:44.166 --> 17:45.995
What about last night?

17:46.099 --> 17:48.964
- Coming in here.
- Who?

17:49.068 --> 17:50.931
We talked about it
in the kitchen.

17:51.035 --> 17:51.967
I don't remember that.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.107
Are you sure it wasn't a dream?

17:55.695 --> 17:59.285
What are you looking for?
I started a load this morning.

17:59.388 --> 18:00.941
You did laundry this morning?

18:01.045 --> 18:03.772
You're saying
Vivian came in here?

18:08.190 --> 18:10.572
We talked about it.

18:10.675 --> 18:13.368
- I wet myself.
- Wet yourself?

18:14.058 --> 18:15.853
Be straight with me, JP.

18:22.135 --> 18:23.792
I'll be completely
straight with you,

18:23.895 --> 18:27.175
and this is something
you'll just have to lean into.

18:27.278 --> 18:29.832
This house is, you know,
a beautiful place,

18:29.936 --> 18:31.834
but it's a strange place.

18:31.938 --> 18:35.390
What can I say, the imagination
is one of its oldest allies.

18:44.364 --> 18:47.195
What are you doing
with those sleeping bags?

18:47.298 --> 18:49.128
I found these when I was
clearing out the workshop

18:49.231 --> 18:51.060
this morning, and thought...

18:51.164 --> 18:53.580
for old time's sake,
we might...

18:53.684 --> 18:55.824
Oh no, JP, I think
we're too old for that.

18:55.927 --> 18:57.446
Please?

18:58.516 --> 19:00.415
Please?

19:00.518 --> 19:02.382
Please, please, please,
please, please, please,

19:02.486 --> 19:04.281
please, please, please, please.

19:42.871 --> 19:45.391
- It's a bit rough for me, JP.
- I'm sorry, Francis.

19:45.494 --> 19:46.633
I was just playing.

19:46.737 --> 19:48.842
I haven't played with anyone
in a while.

19:50.154 --> 19:51.707
I'm gonna go take a shower.

20:13.936 --> 20:15.524
Breathe.

20:16.732 --> 20:19.425
Can you still say
your presidents?

20:19.528 --> 20:22.186
George Washington, John Adams,

20:22.290 --> 20:26.294
Thomas Jefferson,
James Madison, James Monroe.

20:26.397 --> 20:27.985
John Quincy Adams,

20:28.088 --> 20:29.883
Andrew Jackson,

20:29.987 --> 20:33.473
Martin Van Buren,
William Henry Harrison.

20:35.268 --> 20:37.063
Your heart is good.

20:37.166 --> 20:39.099
Blood pressure's good.

20:39.203 --> 20:41.240
I might start you
on the inhaler again.

20:41.343 --> 20:43.000
Are you drinking
plenty of water?

20:43.103 --> 20:44.312
No.

20:44.415 --> 20:48.316
I've known Jean Paul
since he was seven pounds,

20:48.419 --> 20:50.387
and even as a baby
he was melancholic.

20:50.490 --> 20:51.871
What exactly
is wrong with him?

20:51.974 --> 20:56.427
Francis, you know,
sometimes a sickness of the soul

20:56.531 --> 20:59.465
can will the body
to suffer likewise.

20:59.568 --> 21:02.468
That being said,
it could be a number of things.

21:02.571 --> 21:04.953
He shouldn't
exert himself so much.

21:05.056 --> 21:08.577
At least not so dynamically.
I recommend stretching.

21:08.681 --> 21:09.923
Stretching?

21:10.027 --> 21:11.339
Make sure he's hydrated,

21:11.442 --> 21:13.513
that he doesn't drink
too much alcohol.

21:13.617 --> 21:16.516
And talk to him.
Keep him company.

21:16.620 --> 21:21.072
What he needs right now
is a companion, a friend.

21:38.607 --> 21:41.127
'I saw what you did, kid,
it was great.

21:41.230 --> 21:43.716
'I'm proud of you, Frankie.'

21:44.855 --> 21:45.959
'Thanks Lieutenant.'

21:58.178 --> 22:01.768
'All right, keep it there.
You'll be alright then.'

22:07.533 --> 22:09.535
Isn't this wonderful,

22:09.638 --> 22:12.538
getting to spend
all this time together?

22:16.196 --> 22:17.439
Francis?

22:21.305 --> 22:23.376
It is.

23:01.414 --> 23:02.933
It's quiet.

23:03.899 --> 23:05.729
Very quiet.

23:07.144 --> 23:10.665
You know, my grandmother drank
herself to death in this room.

23:11.493 --> 23:13.530
Did I ever tell you that?

23:16.533 --> 23:19.708
Every once in a while
when it's quiet...

23:20.502 --> 23:22.504
you can hear her sigh.

24:35.508 --> 24:37.027
Francis.

24:42.239 --> 24:44.103
I had a terrible dream.

24:48.348 --> 24:49.695
May I sit?

24:55.528 --> 24:56.909
OK.

25:14.409 --> 25:17.170
There was a creature
in the dream.

25:19.138 --> 25:23.798
A sort of man, but something
was wrong with his face.

25:28.734 --> 25:31.702
And he'd wrapped it
in a shirt or something.

25:39.365 --> 25:42.264
I knew that underneath
was the face of a dog

25:42.368 --> 25:44.232
and the face of a pig.

25:48.719 --> 25:50.963
And everywhere he went,
he crawled,

25:51.066 --> 25:54.242
and he wore a leather jacket
and jeans.

25:56.002 --> 26:00.731
In the dream, I knew
his name was The Bloodhound.

26:00.835 --> 26:04.701
And I knew he got around
by using the rivers and sewers.

26:11.846 --> 26:15.194
He'd crawl into a house
and hide in the closet.

26:17.541 --> 26:19.681
And the house
would give him power,

26:19.785 --> 26:22.581
and he'd fill everyone
with fear.

26:25.307 --> 26:28.310
And they'd be afraid
until there was a tenderness

26:28.414 --> 26:31.486
between the people
in the house.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.695
A real tenderness.

26:35.455 --> 26:36.940
An apology.

26:40.357 --> 26:41.910
Forgiveness.

26:43.394 --> 26:45.604
The real deal sort of thing.

26:51.540 --> 26:56.338
And then he'd move down
the river and find a new house.

27:07.902 --> 27:09.938
It was just a bad dream.

27:15.564 --> 27:17.670
Can I stay in here?

27:19.776 --> 27:21.709
Stay in here?

27:24.539 --> 27:27.266
I'm still a little spooked.

28:48.071 --> 28:51.764
Well, I know it wasn't
me, because I'm still hungry.

28:51.868 --> 28:54.353
I'd never
treat a brat that way.

28:54.456 --> 28:56.217
That leaves Vivian.

30:17.125 --> 30:19.300
I don't want to act
like a crazy person,

30:19.403 --> 30:21.612
but what the fuck
are you doing?

30:23.752 --> 30:25.064
Dishes.

30:28.240 --> 30:30.449
I thought I told you
to leave Vivian alone.

30:30.552 --> 30:31.726
She's in the shower.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.762
I thought I'd see
if there were any plates.

30:33.866 --> 30:36.351
You don't need to go
into her room,

30:36.455 --> 30:37.490
definitely not.

30:37.594 --> 30:39.941
There's a bowl of vomit
on the floor in there.

30:40.045 --> 30:41.563
Goddammit, Francis.

30:41.667 --> 30:44.221
Why can't you mind
your own fucking business?

30:44.325 --> 30:47.604
- I don't think she's well, JP.
- She's not, for Christ's sake.

30:47.707 --> 30:49.226
She's out of her bird.

30:49.330 --> 30:51.435
And that doesn't concern you?

30:52.091 --> 30:54.542
Are you kidding me?

30:54.645 --> 30:57.234
All I do is try to help her.

30:57.338 --> 31:00.513
And you can help
by leaving her alone

31:00.617 --> 31:02.274
and following the house rules.

31:02.377 --> 31:04.345
Yeah, keep my shoes
in the cave

31:04.448 --> 31:06.865
and only go into the rooms
you say I can go into.

31:06.968 --> 31:08.556
You're a guest, aren't you?

31:10.247 --> 31:13.423
I don't see what's so
unreasonable about that.

32:18.177 --> 32:20.076
You're not supposed
to listen to Mozart

32:20.179 --> 32:22.009
to feel bad about yourself.

32:22.112 --> 32:25.598
You listen to Mozart
to stir the wonder.

32:25.702 --> 32:31.156
I know Natasha isn't, you know,
a world class soprano...

32:32.778 --> 32:35.125
but she can still
light the fire,

32:35.229 --> 32:37.162
stir the wonder a little.

32:46.136 --> 32:49.243
I guess it wasn't exactly
the kind of connectivity

32:49.346 --> 32:52.280
and shared experience
I was hoping for.

32:54.213 --> 32:55.490
Don't you think
it'd be interesting

32:55.594 --> 32:58.562
to go down the hill
to a bar or something?

32:59.736 --> 33:02.981
I'd rather walk along the beach
until I died.

33:11.575 --> 33:13.301
I know what to do.

33:16.753 --> 33:18.962
I wanna show you something.

33:31.975 --> 33:34.495
I don't get it, JP,
it's a porno.

33:35.944 --> 33:38.430
Call it what you want.

33:38.533 --> 33:40.742
Feels a heck of a lot
like a porno.

33:43.193 --> 33:45.299
Recognize the couch?

33:48.440 --> 33:51.201
Good god, JP,
did you make this?

34:00.003 --> 34:01.522
Who are these women?

34:01.625 --> 34:03.489
Friends.

34:05.353 --> 34:07.666
Well, expensive friends.

34:14.190 --> 34:16.226
This is very hardcore, JP.

34:18.470 --> 34:21.024
I've suddenly
remembered something.

34:21.128 --> 34:24.683
We watched a porno
when we were...

34:24.786 --> 34:26.857
God, we must have been 12.

34:27.789 --> 34:30.240
I don't remember that.

34:30.344 --> 34:33.623
We were in my room, in the dark.
You were behind me.

34:35.073 --> 34:37.385
It was a fairy tale porno.

34:39.974 --> 34:42.701
Alice as sodomized by a cat-man!

34:46.808 --> 34:50.502
Does it make you uncomfortable
when I touch your leg?

34:52.262 --> 34:54.126
What about up here?

34:54.230 --> 34:56.197
Relax Francis.

34:59.718 --> 35:01.237
Or here?

35:02.859 --> 35:04.861
Holy cow, Francis!

35:04.964 --> 35:06.690
We were just playing around.

35:06.794 --> 35:08.451
- We're drinking!
- I'm going to bed.

35:08.554 --> 35:10.729
We're drinking,
we're nightclubbing!

35:10.832 --> 35:13.939
- You should have some water.
- Fuck your water, Francis, OK?

35:14.042 --> 35:15.699
- Fuck it!

35:23.569 --> 35:25.123
I'm sorry.

35:31.819 --> 35:34.477
I'm sorry, you're right,
can I have some water?

35:55.463 --> 35:57.258
- Hi.
- That was 45 minutes.

35:57.362 --> 35:58.708
Uh, no, that was 35.

35:58.811 --> 36:00.710
No, 45, which means
we don't pay you,

36:00.813 --> 36:02.401
and you can fuck off
back down the driveway.

36:02.505 --> 36:04.265
- JP, just...
- I was 35.

36:04.369 --> 36:07.406
- This man's a lunatic, Francis.
- I am not, you are.

36:08.096 --> 36:09.477
I'm gonna kill you!

36:22.732 --> 36:24.630
Developments in neuroscience
have suggested

36:24.734 --> 36:26.632
that entering a new space
or crossing a threshold

36:26.736 --> 36:29.946
can cause one to forget whatever
it was they were entering to do.

36:33.605 --> 36:35.572
Did you use all the cash?

36:39.507 --> 36:40.612
Francis?

36:48.827 --> 36:50.725
He went for a grand.

36:50.829 --> 36:52.382
He deserved none of it.

36:52.486 --> 36:53.866
That's a lot of cash
to have on hand.

36:53.970 --> 36:56.455
Yeah, well,
you gotta have pizza money.

37:02.012 --> 37:04.222
Are you alright?

37:05.637 --> 37:09.468
Ah, it feels like my head
is being squeezed by some demon.

37:10.952 --> 37:12.851
I'll get you some aspirin.

37:22.343 --> 37:23.931
What was I doing?

37:49.784 --> 37:51.959
Francis,
I'm gonna have a nap.

39:48.213 --> 39:52.010
Someone crawled around while
we were sleeping and robbed us.

39:55.013 --> 39:56.463
My cameras are gone.

39:58.465 --> 40:01.053
And someone
got into the pizza money.

40:02.883 --> 40:03.987
Pizza money?

40:05.575 --> 40:07.715
Was there a lot?

40:07.819 --> 40:11.132
There was a lot of pizza money,
as a matter of fact.

40:13.652 --> 40:16.068
What a shit show!

40:22.143 --> 40:23.421
Do you want to call the cops?

40:23.524 --> 40:26.251
Just let me know what you're
missing. We'll take care of it.

40:26.354 --> 40:27.770
You're not responsible, JP.

40:27.873 --> 40:29.979
It's nothing for me
to replace your cameras,

40:30.082 --> 40:31.187
you know that.

40:32.671 --> 40:33.948
Whatever you say.

40:37.124 --> 40:39.471
I just wish
we could have caught him.

40:41.473 --> 40:45.235
I wouldn't want to kill him.
I just want him to feel fear.

40:57.765 --> 41:00.596
Do you want me
to call Dr. Ricky?

41:05.393 --> 41:07.499
I want you to call the bakery.

41:08.189 --> 41:09.328
Edmond's.

41:09.432 --> 41:11.434
I want a chocolate cake
with butter cream frosting.

41:11.538 --> 41:12.711
And let's clean this up.

41:12.815 --> 41:14.644
I don't want Vivian
to see what's happened.

41:16.681 --> 41:18.027
What's the cake for?

41:18.648 --> 41:20.443
Vivian's birthday.

41:20.547 --> 41:22.169
Oh, shit.

41:22.272 --> 41:24.171
October 26th.

41:25.379 --> 41:27.864
I forgot, I'm sorry.

41:29.038 --> 41:30.177
Happy birthday.

41:30.280 --> 41:33.007
I don't care about birthdays,
but I care about Vivian.

41:33.111 --> 41:36.563
Chocolate cake
with butter cream frosting.

41:36.666 --> 41:39.462
- Sure.
- What did I say?

41:39.566 --> 41:42.189
Chocolate cake
with butter cream frosting.

41:42.292 --> 41:43.984
She goes nuts for it.

41:45.503 --> 41:47.677
What do you want for dinner?

41:51.129 --> 41:52.648
Brats.

42:40.558 --> 42:42.180
You look anxious.

42:46.702 --> 42:49.946
I had a bad dream last night.

42:50.050 --> 42:53.087
You really want to get
out of here, don't you?

42:56.435 --> 42:58.058
Why do you say that, JP?

42:58.161 --> 43:02.062
Trapped in this house,
and we're not even safe anymore.

43:02.165 --> 43:06.100
You can't make peace anywhere.
Someone always fucks it up.

43:12.590 --> 43:15.662
Are you going to leave me,
Francis?

43:19.079 --> 43:20.839
I'm not going anywhere, JP.

43:22.392 --> 43:24.153
It's your birthday.

43:27.881 --> 43:30.262
What about champagne?

43:30.366 --> 43:32.230
Do you want champagne?

43:35.302 --> 43:37.131
Where can I find some?

43:38.408 --> 43:41.170
There are bottles
in the vault.

43:42.861 --> 43:44.967
I'd go down myself, but...

43:46.900 --> 43:48.971
I'm afraid to go down there.

45:01.146 --> 45:02.769
JP.

45:08.395 --> 45:09.776
JP?

45:14.815 --> 45:17.818
- Can you hear me?

45:26.585 --> 45:28.104
JP?

45:34.386 --> 45:36.181
'Hello?'

45:37.010 --> 45:39.495
JP, the vault door has closed.

45:44.638 --> 45:46.778
'Oh, no.'

45:48.573 --> 45:50.333
Can you help me out?

45:56.270 --> 45:58.997
You don't like it down there?

46:00.792 --> 46:02.276
No.

46:06.487 --> 46:07.868
'Oh.

46:15.807 --> 46:18.810
'I guess I ought to
let you out.'

46:20.708 --> 46:22.538
Thank you.

46:50.255 --> 46:53.258
Press zero six times
on the call box.

47:10.068 --> 47:13.589
I know it's ridiculous, OK?

47:13.692 --> 47:15.522
Keeping myself here.

47:18.214 --> 47:20.251
To be perfectly honest
with you, Francis,

47:20.354 --> 47:23.357
I feel like a slave
to some sort of...

47:24.807 --> 47:27.983
I don't know, irrational fear.

47:30.537 --> 47:32.366
What can I say about it?

47:36.888 --> 47:40.409
I keep thinking
I'll suddenly wake up...

47:41.789 --> 47:45.207
floating around in space alone.

47:47.105 --> 47:49.521
Spinning forever.

47:50.488 --> 47:52.870
Occasionally bumping
into someone else

47:52.973 --> 47:55.044
who's also floating...

47:56.666 --> 47:58.220
but they're always a stranger,

47:58.323 --> 48:01.326
and they're never happy
to see me.

48:02.603 --> 48:05.192
I'm happy to see you, JP.

48:09.438 --> 48:11.198
Yeah.

48:14.236 --> 48:17.825
I wish that were true
of my own sister.

48:17.929 --> 48:20.932
She won't even
have dinner with us.

48:24.556 --> 48:30.148
Every time I try to get close,
I make it worse.

48:32.219 --> 48:35.982
I don't understand
how she can be so cold.

48:54.069 --> 48:56.795
I don't want any cake.

48:56.899 --> 48:59.212
I have an idea.

48:59.315 --> 49:01.490
She's not gonna go for this.

49:06.771 --> 49:09.394
She gets sort of unreasonable.

49:10.430 --> 49:12.984
Knock, before
these things go out.

49:21.510 --> 49:24.513
Viv, it's me.

49:26.825 --> 49:29.552
I'm with Francis.
We have a cake.

49:30.588 --> 49:33.625
It's chocolate
with butter cream frosting.

49:39.355 --> 49:41.288
Francis has lit
a number of candles.

49:41.392 --> 49:42.600
We thought for your birthday

49:42.703 --> 49:45.258
we could all have
some cake and champagne.

49:47.225 --> 49:48.744
What do you say?

49:53.852 --> 49:56.476
These candles are gonna turn
into a thin layer of wax...

50:18.222 --> 50:20.258
I did warn you.

50:28.266 --> 50:30.061
I'll get you a glass.

50:30.165 --> 50:33.340
- That's not necessary, JP.
- Shut up, Francis.

50:34.583 --> 50:36.171
It's my birthday.

50:45.490 --> 50:47.147
I'm not blind.

50:48.010 --> 50:49.667
I have eyes.

50:51.082 --> 50:53.671
More importantly,
I have feelings.

50:55.259 --> 50:58.745
I know things haven't been
going so well around here.

51:00.471 --> 51:03.750
My only surviving
family member hates me.

51:03.853 --> 51:06.925
You and I haven't achieved
any sort of connectivity

51:07.029 --> 51:09.859
or shared experiences,
I know that.

51:15.900 --> 51:17.522
Or whatever that means.

51:27.981 --> 51:29.638
Anyway, I haven't got long.

51:33.987 --> 51:36.403
You don't know that.

51:36.507 --> 51:39.441
You don't even know
what's wrong with you.

51:40.580 --> 51:42.409
I feel it coming.

51:47.449 --> 51:50.348
I had a dream last night, too,
you know?

51:52.730 --> 51:54.490
That Vivian died...

51:59.150 --> 52:01.256
and we put her in the vault.

52:04.500 --> 52:08.435
And we were sitting
on the floor upstairs crying...

52:09.816 --> 52:12.370
when suddenly
I got this horrible feeling

52:12.474 --> 52:15.270
that she wasn't really dead.

52:30.285 --> 52:33.598
And so I rushed down...

52:33.702 --> 52:36.843
and when I found her,
she was standing there.

52:40.536 --> 52:42.607
And she came over to me...

52:44.437 --> 52:45.886
and she kissed me,

52:48.579 --> 52:50.926
and we both fell to the floor.

52:53.515 --> 52:55.482
I guess we were both dead.

53:03.801 --> 53:07.356
It was so real
I can't even tell you.

54:13.146 --> 54:14.975
I've seen the tears
of the oppressed,

54:15.079 --> 54:17.150
and they had no comforter,

54:17.254 --> 54:19.325
and power is on the side
of the oppressors

54:19.428 --> 54:21.844
and they have no comforter.

54:22.914 --> 54:25.503
And I know that the dead
who've already died

54:25.607 --> 54:28.057
are happier than the living...

54:29.473 --> 54:33.062
but better than both is the one
who has never been born.

56:46.644 --> 56:48.957
JP, where's Vivian?

56:52.616 --> 56:54.618
Dead, Francis.

56:57.068 --> 56:59.070
Vivian died last night.

57:04.662 --> 57:08.597
As far as I'm concerned,
she killed herself.

57:10.737 --> 57:13.637
- JP.
- Tomorrow she'll be cremated.

57:19.263 --> 57:23.060
I have permission to keep
her here with us until then.

57:26.408 --> 57:27.823
In the vault...

57:31.378 --> 57:32.725
Just in case.

57:35.555 --> 57:37.212
You can't be serious.

57:44.840 --> 57:47.705
I'm going to go be alone
for a while.

59:21.868 --> 59:24.077
What was this, Francis?

59:25.492 --> 59:27.149
What was what?

59:30.774 --> 59:32.983
How did we get here?

59:34.363 --> 59:35.848
You and I?

59:35.951 --> 59:38.229
Or people in general?

59:38.333 --> 59:39.714
Mm.

59:44.201 --> 59:47.687
Well, there was a bang.

59:51.208 --> 59:52.761
A bang.

59:55.419 --> 59:57.179
Something like that.

59:58.560 --> 1:00:00.148
Planets were formed.

1:00:02.702 --> 1:00:05.394
Somehow water got into the mix.

1:00:08.950 --> 1:00:10.883
Then we got some fish.

1:00:12.678 --> 1:00:15.888
The fish
climbed out of the sea.

1:00:18.131 --> 1:00:19.823
Turned into apes.

1:00:21.203 --> 1:00:24.897
And then one day,
the apes woke up.

1:00:26.381 --> 1:00:28.625
The apes woke up.

1:00:28.728 --> 1:00:32.145
They woke up
and saw the world,

1:00:32.249 --> 1:00:33.906
you could say.

1:00:39.601 --> 1:00:42.017
The apes turned into JP...

1:00:44.848 --> 1:00:46.712
crying on the floor.

1:00:55.686 --> 1:00:57.239
I had this thought
my whole life

1:00:57.343 --> 1:01:00.208
that it was all going
to mean something.

1:01:02.589 --> 1:01:05.040
That it was all gonna
add up somehow.

1:01:08.216 --> 1:01:09.907
But I don't know.

1:01:12.289 --> 1:01:13.670
Does it?

1:01:17.397 --> 1:01:20.400
Friendship means something,
doesn't it?

1:01:24.473 --> 1:01:26.890
What can I do for you, JP?

1:01:33.310 --> 1:01:35.243
Will you hold me?

1:01:37.590 --> 1:01:39.316
I guess I'm scared.

1:01:44.217 --> 1:01:45.736
OK.

1:02:01.062 --> 1:02:03.167
I just wanted
to give Viv a bracelet

1:02:03.271 --> 1:02:06.515
that was like the one
I lost when we were kids.

1:02:09.001 --> 1:02:11.555
I took it from her
at dad's place in Malibu

1:02:11.658 --> 1:02:13.868
and lost it in the waves.

1:02:15.283 --> 1:02:16.387
I was so scared

1:02:16.491 --> 1:02:19.736
because I realized
how big the ocean was.

1:02:21.945 --> 1:02:23.636
And I thought
about all the years

1:02:23.740 --> 1:02:26.121
it'd be at bottom of the sea.

1:02:27.709 --> 1:02:29.504
Long after I'm gone.

1:02:32.852 --> 1:02:34.095
Sorry, JP.

1:02:34.198 --> 1:02:37.443
I dragged her down with me,
squeezed too tight.

1:02:37.546 --> 1:02:38.720
- JP.
- And I've tried

1:02:38.824 --> 1:02:41.205
to drag you down
with me, too.

1:02:41.309 --> 1:02:45.140
I just wanted to get back
to a place where things were...

1:02:47.833 --> 1:02:49.800
I don't know, Francis.

1:02:51.146 --> 1:02:52.769
New?

1:02:54.805 --> 1:02:56.289
Full of mystery.

1:03:04.573 --> 1:03:06.541
I took the money.

1:03:09.095 --> 1:03:11.201
I stole the money.

1:03:14.825 --> 1:03:17.138
I guess I've been scared, too.

1:03:20.969 --> 1:03:24.317
When I came here, I was only
thinking about myself.

1:03:27.217 --> 1:03:29.978
But when I started thinking
about leaving...

1:03:32.981 --> 1:03:36.433
I realized you're
the only real friend I have.

1:04:00.457 --> 1:04:02.217
I know, Francis.

1:04:04.288 --> 1:04:08.292
There's nothing that happens
in this house that goes unknown.

1:04:16.438 --> 1:04:19.510
I just needed
to hear it from you.

1:04:23.963 --> 1:04:26.034
That's all I've ever wanted.

1:04:48.022 --> 1:04:49.540
What is that?

1:04:57.376 --> 1:04:58.687
JP?

1:05:02.174 --> 1:05:03.485
JP?

1:07:44.198 --> 1:07:46.510
You were Mr. Luret's
caretaker?

1:07:49.203 --> 1:07:50.618
I was his friend.

1:07:52.758 --> 1:07:53.862
Joe.

1:08:02.457 --> 1:08:04.218
I don't know what this is.

1:08:04.321 --> 1:08:06.151
It means it's all yours.

1:08:06.254 --> 1:08:07.842
There's no one else on there.

1:08:09.257 --> 1:08:11.121
And there's this.
