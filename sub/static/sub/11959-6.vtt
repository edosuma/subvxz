00:04.343 --> 00:05.984
The day you die

00:06.727 --> 00:09.626
is just like every other day.

00:12.735 --> 00:17.415
You wake and dress and eat and drink.

00:19.050 --> 00:22.010
Just like every other day.

00:28.533 --> 00:31.384
You don't see death coming.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.040
Or hear its approach.

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:44.545 --> 00:47.435
Because you are too busy living.

00:53.110 --> 00:56.090
Too busy enjoying your life.

00:58.867 --> 01:01.181
Sating your appetites.

01:39.701 --> 01:41.020
Thank you.

01:41.030 --> 01:45.168
Rich man or beggar,
it does not discriminate.

01:51.846 --> 01:55.610
Death doesn't care about
fleeing your demons,

02:00.492 --> 02:03.492
or making amends for them.

02:15.423 --> 02:18.595
It doesn't care about any of that.

02:19.197 --> 02:23.943
It cares only that this is your time.

02:26.617 --> 02:27.920
Your day...

02:28.857 --> 02:30.050
to die.

02:46.650 --> 02:49.920
And this is the Musketeers' day.

02:59.050 --> 03:01.050
No mistakes this time.

03:05.266 --> 03:06.605
Of course not.

03:07.559 --> 03:08.679
By dusk,

03:09.797 --> 03:11.608
Athos and his friends...

03:13.530 --> 03:15.030
will be dead.

04:11.824 --> 04:13.603
Next time, try not to wait until

04:13.627 --> 04:15.557
the bottle's kissing the ground
before shooting.

04:15.558 --> 04:17.978
It's not good for the nerves.

04:18.003 --> 04:20.855
Next time, don't choose
such a small pebble.

04:21.791 --> 04:23.149
I could barely hear it.

04:28.250 --> 04:30.648
- Here's your share.
- Thank you.

04:33.320 --> 04:34.450
Thank you.

04:35.631 --> 04:38.275
You boys are expensive to feed.

04:39.310 --> 04:41.724
Especially you. Come on, give.

04:47.132 --> 04:48.660
Half of that.

04:48.685 --> 04:51.585
D'Artagnan, this came earlier.

04:59.499 --> 05:00.529
Porthos!

05:02.641 --> 05:03.974
It's a letter from Treville.

05:03.999 --> 05:06.003
We have to meet General
Verdet's aide in Bourgogne,

05:06.028 --> 05:08.096
and escort him back to Paris.
He has news from the front.

05:08.121 --> 05:09.051
What now?

05:09.076 --> 05:11.425
No, not now, go to sleep.
The war will wait.

05:11.450 --> 05:13.310
The three of us
are to leave immediately.

05:13.320 --> 05:16.594
By "immediately", I do presume
you mean after breakfast?

05:17.320 --> 05:18.530
Since I've paid for it.

05:22.195 --> 05:23.781
I think we should wait for Athos,

05:24.300 --> 05:25.851
let him know where we are going.

05:26.070 --> 05:27.420
Wait how long exactly?

05:34.886 --> 05:37.866
I'm going to have to start charging
you lodgings. You're here so often.

05:38.228 --> 05:39.488
Is this a complaint?

05:40.213 --> 05:42.473
Do I look dissatisfied?

05:42.498 --> 05:45.145
No, no.

05:45.170 --> 05:47.340
I will not be responsible
for distracting

05:47.350 --> 05:50.330
the Captain of the Musketeers
from his duties.

05:50.355 --> 05:53.375
After all, the King and Paris
depend on you.

05:54.400 --> 05:57.400
I'll... I'll get breakfast.

06:51.300 --> 06:52.930
I saw you...

06:53.758 --> 06:55.172
on the battlefield?

07:33.776 --> 07:35.730
Defend yourself, Captain.

07:36.676 --> 07:39.716
Or where is the honour in killing you?

08:35.419 --> 08:36.490
Athos!

08:38.932 --> 08:40.448
Let me help you.

08:41.330 --> 08:42.559
Where is Grimaud?

08:42.995 --> 08:44.284
Dead. I shot him.

08:50.460 --> 08:52.123
Show me.

09:04.550 --> 09:07.641
He was there. I shot him.

09:08.310 --> 09:09.500
He fell right there.

09:10.648 --> 09:13.498
The others are in grave danger.

09:24.098 --> 09:26.257
The Governor is here to see you.

09:26.470 --> 09:28.770
I'm not receiving visitors.

09:29.350 --> 09:31.938
You have not heard
what I have come to say.

09:33.420 --> 09:37.400
When this is over, Philippe,
and justice has been served,

09:37.410 --> 09:39.972
you'll pay for how I have been treated!

09:40.361 --> 09:42.869
I am a son of France,

09:43.074 --> 09:44.319
a prince of the blood.

09:44.320 --> 09:46.480
And yet you lock me up here
like an animal!

09:58.608 --> 10:01.899
It doesn't get any easier, this killing.

10:08.360 --> 10:10.046
You better swap clothes with him.

10:17.090 --> 10:18.301
Hurry.

10:19.660 --> 10:21.123
We don't have much time.

10:22.892 --> 10:25.812
I take it the King
doesn't know about this?

10:26.450 --> 10:27.530
No.

10:35.120 --> 10:37.480
You really think it's
necessary to go after them?

10:37.732 --> 10:40.832
If it's the slightest chance they
are walking into a trap, yes.

10:41.224 --> 10:42.826
What is so urgent, it couldn't...

10:48.540 --> 10:50.460
Did you write that?

10:59.388 --> 11:00.388
No.

11:05.190 --> 11:07.130
I'll get the cadets ready to leave.

11:07.155 --> 11:08.866
That message is a forgery,

11:08.960 --> 11:10.960
designed to lure Aramis,

11:11.530 --> 11:14.470
Porthos and d'Artagnan into an ambush.

11:15.301 --> 11:16.461
Who did this?

11:17.540 --> 11:18.814
Grimaud.

11:19.340 --> 11:22.039
You saw him with Feron? Were
they in deep conversation?

11:22.064 --> 11:23.752
It certainly looked like it.

11:23.777 --> 11:27.420
An alliance with Feron puts the
Red Guard at Grimaud's disposal.

11:30.520 --> 11:32.380
- Sir?
- Saddle up.

11:40.460 --> 11:42.500
My clothes, bring me my clothes.

11:47.390 --> 11:49.469
When I said ordinary,
I didn't mean ugly.

11:49.556 --> 11:52.676
We can alter them again, Your Majesty.

11:53.120 --> 11:55.350
No, it's too late now,
this will have to do.

11:58.781 --> 12:00.601
Louis, why don't I accompany you?

12:02.326 --> 12:04.346
I know how difficult
today must be for you.

12:05.340 --> 12:07.133
Anniversary of your father's death.

12:07.158 --> 12:09.420
I've already arranged
an escort. Thank you.

12:10.590 --> 12:11.670
Now, where is my money?

12:27.597 --> 12:28.904
Hold, hold, hold!

12:33.340 --> 12:34.380
Do you hear that?

12:35.224 --> 12:37.275
- How many?
- Five riders.

12:37.308 --> 12:39.029
Maybe more. Hyah!

12:45.490 --> 12:46.490
Shh. Shh.

12:52.126 --> 12:53.450
Red Guards.

12:59.430 --> 13:03.439
Aramis, you are to return
with us to the palace.

13:03.440 --> 13:04.896
The King commands it.

13:05.883 --> 13:08.396
We have business, on behalf
of Minister Treville.

13:10.704 --> 13:12.754
Are you questioning a royal order?

13:12.779 --> 13:14.088
No, believe me, if we were,

13:14.113 --> 13:15.893
we wouldn't be taking it up
with the messenger boy.

13:20.777 --> 13:23.883
If you come now, you won't be arrested.

13:32.141 --> 13:33.383
Very well.

13:34.344 --> 13:36.344
I'll see you back at the garrison.

13:57.212 --> 13:58.342
Get him some food.

13:59.987 --> 14:03.077
You'll stay here until nightfall

14:03.400 --> 14:06.887
then, we'll take you out of
Paris under cover of darkness.

14:07.811 --> 14:12.708
And please don't draw
attention to yourself, hmm?

14:14.981 --> 14:15.990
Where are you going?

14:16.015 --> 14:17.488
I must make sure

14:17.616 --> 14:19.845
my absence has not been noted.

14:19.870 --> 14:21.160
But I will be back.

14:21.479 --> 14:22.881
Oh, and remember,

14:23.087 --> 14:24.991
if any of Grimaud's men

14:25.138 --> 14:26.892
ask your name, it is?

14:27.195 --> 14:30.810
- "Victor". I know.
- Yes, quite right.

14:32.340 --> 14:34.423
Victor! Suits you.

14:52.187 --> 14:55.430
And to Victor, the spoils.

15:35.125 --> 15:36.537
So, you're my benefactor.

15:37.550 --> 15:39.540
You're the man behind all this.

15:41.340 --> 15:42.594
Don't worry.

15:43.742 --> 15:45.643
There will be time to discuss
how you can...

15:47.314 --> 15:49.314
repay the debt.

16:00.450 --> 16:02.360
Do I make a good Pilgrim?

16:03.241 --> 16:06.331
Well, Feron, am I transformed?

16:07.642 --> 16:11.946
No garments, no matter how dreary,

16:12.310 --> 16:15.854
could disguise
Your Majesty's regal bearing.

16:17.566 --> 16:18.726
What do you think?

16:18.946 --> 16:22.310
I think it would be safer if you
were accompanied by a royal guard.

16:25.350 --> 16:28.839
Why must you question my every decision?
Why? I am angry now.

16:29.243 --> 16:31.460
I was happy before
and you have made me...

16:41.982 --> 16:45.327
The Musketeer Aramis, as requested.

16:54.579 --> 16:56.619
You are to accompany me on a pilgrimage.

16:57.560 --> 16:59.662
A pilgrimage, Your Majesty?

17:00.861 --> 17:03.871
Well, you are a man of God,
Aramis. Or so you say.

17:04.430 --> 17:06.329
I was once.

17:06.339 --> 17:09.540
But now, I am just a soldier
and your loyal servant.

17:09.560 --> 17:12.460
Well, perhaps it is time we
reacquainted you with your God.

17:14.339 --> 17:15.531
Yes, Your Majesty.

17:18.420 --> 17:19.836
We leave within the hour.

18:05.848 --> 18:08.545
Why would the General's aide choose
to meet somewhere like this?

18:08.570 --> 18:10.380
That's a good question.

18:11.520 --> 18:14.500
- Let's go see what's inside.
- I'll wait here.

18:47.104 --> 18:49.127
Aramis is back in Paris.

18:50.460 --> 18:52.310
What's going on?

18:54.042 --> 18:56.472
He has been summoned back by the King.

18:57.370 --> 18:59.871
They are going on a pilgrimage,

19:00.490 --> 19:02.319
to the Royal Mausoleum.

19:03.370 --> 19:05.501
What about Porthos and d'Artagnan?

19:08.598 --> 19:11.608
Marcheaux assures me they
continued with their journey.

19:15.714 --> 19:18.733
Perhaps it would be better
to reconsider our plans.

19:18.758 --> 19:21.093
No! It's too late for that!

19:27.390 --> 19:29.450
How many guards are with the King?

19:30.553 --> 19:32.857
Oh, Aramis, alone.

19:35.122 --> 19:37.430
Then wait for them outside the Mausoleum

19:38.370 --> 19:39.946
and kill them both there.

19:43.191 --> 19:45.796
You... You mean the King as well?

19:46.769 --> 19:48.779
We cannot kill the King.

19:48.810 --> 19:51.616
We have to. Athos saw me.
There's no going back now.

19:52.330 --> 19:55.408
My dear fellow, that would be
treason and foolhardy.

19:55.433 --> 19:57.112
Louis is already dying.

19:57.773 --> 19:59.633
I hope you are not having doubts, Feron?

19:59.658 --> 20:01.622
You are asking me to kill
my own brother!

20:01.647 --> 20:04.929
If you don't, then he will
discover your betrayal

20:04.954 --> 20:06.504
and hang you.

20:07.007 --> 20:10.336
And if he doesn't, I will hang you!

20:12.141 --> 20:13.241
Thank you.

20:16.136 --> 20:21.109
You will kill Aramis and the King.

20:21.560 --> 20:23.430
Very well.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.713
Now we found a nice spot
in the shade, we can wait.

20:37.738 --> 20:38.945
Properly.

20:43.440 --> 20:46.440
Come on, come on. That's it, good...

20:46.450 --> 20:48.643
Please be good,
please be good, please be good.

20:51.450 --> 20:53.926
Oh, this could turn out
to be a good day after all.

20:54.642 --> 20:57.420
I imagine the General's aide will
be a little while longer yet.

21:15.261 --> 21:17.431
How many battles did we fight, eh?

21:18.480 --> 21:21.370
- Too many.
- Hmm. Yeah.

21:23.149 --> 21:25.890
We've served our country,
often and well.

21:27.381 --> 21:29.796
So if we are rewarded with
the odd mission like this,

21:30.370 --> 21:31.490
I won't complain.

21:31.500 --> 21:33.743
In that case,
I'd like to propose a toast.

21:35.009 --> 21:37.428
To easy missions, well earned.

21:39.909 --> 21:41.590
To easy missions well earned.

21:46.081 --> 21:47.364
Ooh.

22:07.076 --> 22:08.146
What's wrong?

22:09.239 --> 22:10.409
Wait.

22:10.419 --> 22:13.239
Look at the horses.

22:18.980 --> 22:21.209
- I don't see anything.
- Me neither.

22:30.661 --> 22:33.169
- Did you see that?
- No.

22:33.179 --> 22:34.339
Opposite roof.

22:43.211 --> 22:44.635
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Shh!

22:44.660 --> 22:46.024
Not the wine, not the wine!

22:52.219 --> 22:53.809
Well, that answers that.

22:54.798 --> 22:56.161
How many do you reckon we got?

22:56.517 --> 22:59.096
I'm not sure but I think we can
assume it's more than two.

22:59.116 --> 23:00.906
Yeah.

23:04.199 --> 23:07.209
- My ammunition's out there.
- Yeah, mine too.

23:07.388 --> 23:09.538
- How much have you got?
- Not enough.

23:11.875 --> 23:14.740
When you were, uh, searching
before, you didn't happen to...

23:14.765 --> 23:16.825
No. No other entrances or exits,

23:17.096 --> 23:18.659
and there's no way we're
getting through these windows.

23:18.684 --> 23:20.859
Of course not, because that
would be to our advantage.

23:23.639 --> 23:24.689
Okay.

23:26.344 --> 23:27.849
You had to throw it out, didn't you?

23:27.873 --> 23:29.453
Of all the junk in here,
you had to throw out

23:29.454 --> 23:33.354
the one cask of wine to be
shot to pieces? Well done.

23:33.374 --> 23:35.494
"Easy missions, well earned", Porthos.

24:01.623 --> 24:02.823
Cadets! Time to go!

24:09.933 --> 24:12.414
Grimaud certainly left his mark on you.

24:12.424 --> 24:15.437
Getting caught unarmed and
unawares, doesn't sound like you?

24:17.424 --> 24:19.404
A mistake I will not make again.

24:22.334 --> 24:23.394
We ride hard.

24:34.758 --> 24:36.450
It's eight hours until dark

24:37.082 --> 24:38.161
and what is it?

24:38.162 --> 24:39.980
Four shot balls left.

24:40.005 --> 24:42.745
Eight hours, four shot balls, not
the most encouraging number.

24:42.770 --> 24:45.374
Besides, they're not going to
let us live until dark.

24:45.384 --> 24:47.073
That would just be stupid.

24:50.639 --> 24:51.669
D'Artagnan!

25:00.322 --> 25:02.252
Come on. Come on.

25:09.594 --> 25:13.484
The last thing they're expecting is
for one of us to go out that door.

25:16.524 --> 25:18.454
Because that would be suicide.

25:18.594 --> 25:20.344
Cover me.

25:25.534 --> 25:27.484
Come on, come on, come on.

25:28.404 --> 25:29.594
Yes, yes, yes.

25:29.604 --> 25:31.613
Good, good. What we got?
What we got? What we got?

25:32.192 --> 25:33.872
Oh, you beauty.

25:33.909 --> 25:35.529
Lovely work.

25:44.858 --> 25:47.268
Flush them out. Use the gunpowder.

26:08.384 --> 26:12.494
Why else would Louis choose Aramis
particularly to be his personal guard?

26:13.454 --> 26:14.494
He knows.

26:14.504 --> 26:16.624
You don't know that for sure.

26:17.334 --> 26:19.736
The King has hated me for five years.

26:20.404 --> 26:23.701
I know things have been
difficult between you but...

26:23.726 --> 26:25.847
Our marriage has been for public show.

26:26.414 --> 26:29.526
In private, he's ignored
or slighted me at every turn.

26:31.364 --> 26:32.594
You need to stay strong.

26:32.604 --> 26:34.874
You're still the Queen of France.

26:36.524 --> 26:38.097
Perhaps not for long.

26:40.374 --> 26:42.364
Do you think that the King
would want a scandal

26:42.374 --> 26:43.792
that could endanger the throne?

26:44.354 --> 26:48.514
The Dauphin is his son, the King
could never admit to anything else.

26:52.554 --> 26:55.744
I had hoped that everything
with Aramis was over.

26:56.579 --> 26:57.782
Forgotten.

26:58.940 --> 27:00.051
Is it?

27:02.374 --> 27:06.494
I mean... Has it ever really
been over, for you?

27:14.325 --> 27:18.564
Monsieur, your generosity will
not be overlooked or forgotten.

27:19.232 --> 27:22.221
The Bible says that it is
easier for a camel

27:22.246 --> 27:25.514
to pass through the eye of a needle
than for a rich man to enter heaven.

27:25.930 --> 27:27.090
That is true

27:27.205 --> 27:28.405
if the rich man

27:28.605 --> 27:31.497
does not repent of his sins.

27:32.187 --> 27:34.754
But all who renounce Satan

27:35.414 --> 27:39.423
and are contrite are welcome
in the house of God.

27:39.424 --> 27:40.464
Mmm.

27:45.249 --> 27:47.239
I will pray for your soul.

28:00.394 --> 28:02.414
Word's spread that a man
is visiting churches,

28:02.424 --> 28:04.912
handing out money and
a crowd is gathering outside.

28:04.937 --> 28:07.484
I suggest we return
to the palace immediately.

28:07.494 --> 28:09.504
Do you believe in heaven and hell?

28:12.384 --> 28:14.172
Yes, I believe I do.

28:15.384 --> 28:18.962
That a man will be punished
for his wrongdoing,

28:20.233 --> 28:21.333
for his sins?

28:27.216 --> 28:28.678
Yes, Your Majesty.

28:31.334 --> 28:32.357
So do I.

28:33.424 --> 28:36.414
I wish to visit the tomb of
my father in Saint-Denis

28:37.505 --> 28:39.525
before we return to the palace.

29:06.399 --> 29:08.892
Ah, after all the battles I've been in,

29:08.912 --> 29:11.474
I cannot believe that this is
how I'm gonna die.

29:13.424 --> 29:15.796
Watching the last barrel
of wine spill into the dirt.

29:15.821 --> 29:17.027
I'm sorry about that, by the way.

29:17.052 --> 29:18.217
I know.

29:20.534 --> 29:22.474
Death is mocking me.

29:26.119 --> 29:27.946
You know we're not going to die today.

29:29.815 --> 29:30.915
You might want to tell them that...

29:30.940 --> 29:34.514
I'm not ready, not here,
not like this, not now.

29:37.034 --> 29:38.564
And I've too much left to do.

29:40.842 --> 29:44.272
And I can't die without seeing
Constance's face one last time, can I?

29:51.554 --> 29:54.584
Or laying eyes on the children
we will have together.

29:57.866 --> 29:59.306
Seeing them play,

30:02.384 --> 30:04.384
holding them in my arms,

30:08.514 --> 30:11.394
and teaching them how to ride and shoot

30:13.025 --> 30:14.229
and love.

30:17.222 --> 30:19.262
No, this is not my day.

30:25.274 --> 30:26.821
I have none of that.

30:29.997 --> 30:32.220
No wife, no children, no one.

30:34.394 --> 30:36.264
You have friends.

30:38.264 --> 30:40.294
- Great friends.
- Mmm-hmm.

30:42.324 --> 30:44.040
I have no doubt that one day,

30:44.064 --> 30:46.199
you will have a wife
and child of your own.

30:50.188 --> 30:51.288
Yeah.

31:00.394 --> 31:01.780
Yeah, one day.

31:02.873 --> 31:05.274
And I won't let anyone
take that away from me.

31:06.324 --> 31:08.314
They won't kill us today.

31:12.404 --> 31:14.404
We refuse to die!

32:21.384 --> 32:24.334
Porthos! Aramis!

32:25.860 --> 32:27.222
D'Artagnan!

32:30.362 --> 32:31.742
Come on. Quickly!

32:31.767 --> 32:33.737
Dismount! Help him!

33:21.434 --> 33:22.901
Wait here.

33:23.404 --> 33:24.919
I should go with you.

33:25.404 --> 33:27.334
You should do as I say.

34:33.172 --> 34:35.889
Philippe, you remembered too.

34:37.302 --> 34:41.244
Twenty-five years to the day
since our dear father's death.

34:42.304 --> 34:44.234
Do you remember the funeral?

34:48.313 --> 34:51.264
The streets of Paris lined, 20 deep.

34:52.393 --> 34:53.464
I...

34:54.373 --> 34:55.984
I could not attend.

34:57.354 --> 35:00.234
Bastards can be embarrassing.

35:06.337 --> 35:07.694
You are blood.

35:09.003 --> 35:10.244
You are my blood.

35:15.006 --> 35:16.254
Philippe...

35:17.384 --> 35:19.981
You are the only one I can trust.

35:21.954 --> 35:24.424
The only one who has not betrayed me.

35:27.156 --> 35:28.212
Oh.

35:32.274 --> 35:34.454
Oh, come...

35:36.911 --> 35:38.454
I have something to show you.

35:38.927 --> 35:40.336
Come on.

35:41.931 --> 35:45.731
_

35:54.560 --> 35:55.876
For me?

35:56.374 --> 35:57.333
Of course.

35:57.334 --> 35:59.374
Who'd have thought it, Philippe...

36:01.284 --> 36:03.334
Of all my family...

36:09.129 --> 36:11.233
I have a great favour to ask you.

36:11.234 --> 36:12.294
Anything.

36:14.304 --> 36:18.234
- After my death...
- Many, many years from now.

36:19.786 --> 36:22.383
I want you to be the Dauphin's
familial guardian.

36:23.570 --> 36:26.490
To protect him and educate him.

36:27.934 --> 36:29.627
Provide him with wise counsel,

36:29.652 --> 36:32.469
so that when the time comes,
he will be equipped to reign.

36:36.830 --> 36:38.329
I will treat him,

36:39.030 --> 36:41.030
the Dauphin, as my own son.

36:43.404 --> 36:44.758
I know you will.

37:33.737 --> 37:35.707
Oh, please... Please.

37:39.254 --> 37:41.013
Please, d'Artagnan.

37:42.973 --> 37:44.301
It's not our day.

37:47.264 --> 37:48.778
We refuse to die!

37:50.234 --> 37:52.364
We refuse to die!

38:15.234 --> 38:18.274
You took your time. D'Artagnan...

38:18.757 --> 38:20.577
Keep searching.

38:22.887 --> 38:24.209
D'Artagnan!

38:24.434 --> 38:26.827
Aramis! Aramis!

38:26.852 --> 38:28.148
- He's not here.
- Huh?

38:28.173 --> 38:29.709
He's not here, he's with the King.

38:30.189 --> 38:31.299
From the palace.

38:39.414 --> 38:41.512
Gaston has escaped the Bastille.

38:42.104 --> 38:45.374
And the King and Aramis have not
returned from the Mausoleum.

38:46.324 --> 38:48.324
This is not a coincidence.

38:51.304 --> 38:53.244
We ride for Saint-Denis.

39:10.770 --> 39:12.919
And I would apologise
for the surroundings.

39:12.944 --> 39:14.670
But I imagine,
as a soldier and a priest,

39:14.695 --> 39:16.805
you are well acquainted with death.

39:18.444 --> 39:20.454
More than I'd have wished.

39:23.354 --> 39:27.284
Yes, I too am acquainted with
death more than I'd have wished.

39:28.394 --> 39:30.324
Death has a grip on me.

39:31.104 --> 39:32.414
One I cannot break.

39:34.086 --> 39:35.590
I am so sorry.

39:36.354 --> 39:39.424
I don't want your sympathy.
That's not why you're here.

39:44.123 --> 39:46.383
But there is something
I need from you, Aramis.

39:47.494 --> 39:50.334
Without it, I will not find peace.

39:52.254 --> 39:55.876
A truth I need to hear from
your mouth, and don't lie.

39:57.334 --> 40:00.344
You and my wife may think I'm
a fool but I am not a fool.

40:02.374 --> 40:03.444
I know.

40:09.126 --> 40:10.360
Say it.

40:13.802 --> 40:15.352
It will serve...

40:16.659 --> 40:17.862
no purpose.

40:18.294 --> 40:19.506
You are a musketeer.

40:19.531 --> 40:21.590
You only exist to serve my purpose.

40:21.615 --> 40:23.098
I am ordering you!

40:26.092 --> 40:27.397
Why dredge up the past?

40:29.274 --> 40:32.190
Admit! Admit you slept with the Queen!

40:33.795 --> 40:37.835
I slept with the loneliest
woman in Paris.

40:37.983 --> 40:40.958
Don't you dare make excuses!

40:40.983 --> 40:44.728
This woman suffered years of neglect
and betrayal from your part.

40:44.753 --> 40:48.477
She endured you parading Milady
de Winter through the palace.

40:48.502 --> 40:51.099
Shaming your own wife! Humiliating her.

40:51.124 --> 40:52.619
You swore to protect me!

40:52.644 --> 40:53.801
I am protecting you!

40:56.384 --> 40:59.061
I am protecting you.

41:01.929 --> 41:02.994
No longer.

41:04.490 --> 41:05.711
No, what you have done is treason

41:05.736 --> 41:07.075
and for that, you will hang.

41:11.552 --> 41:12.552
Get out.

41:25.092 --> 41:29.987
I fear we are making
a very grave mistake.

41:30.892 --> 41:34.379
Gaston is not a man we can rely on.

41:35.173 --> 41:37.765
But the King, Louis,

41:39.118 --> 41:40.369
I have his ear.

41:41.267 --> 41:45.042
He has entrusted me with
guardianship of the Dauphin.

41:45.584 --> 41:46.965
You haven't killed him?

41:51.869 --> 41:52.956
No.

41:56.919 --> 42:01.372
I have enjoyed our partnership, Lucien.

42:04.524 --> 42:06.529
But if there is a choice,

42:07.799 --> 42:11.759
who I must betray
between you and the King,

42:12.294 --> 42:13.485
well...

42:15.889 --> 42:17.360
well, I choose you.

42:18.949 --> 42:20.739
Do you realise what you're saying?

42:21.259 --> 42:22.369
Oh, yes.

42:25.709 --> 42:26.905
Today...

42:27.592 --> 42:29.314
is my day.

42:54.356 --> 42:56.536
Don't worry about your beloved brother.

42:56.879 --> 43:00.311
I suspect you will be
seeing him very soon indeed.

44:02.636 --> 44:03.938
Give me a pistol.

44:03.939 --> 44:05.749
Get back inside! And lock the door.

44:06.939 --> 44:08.628
What, are you afraid I'll shoot you?

44:09.417 --> 44:11.838
I have lived my whole life
in fear of death.

44:12.591 --> 44:14.721
I am dying anyway,
what do I have to lose?

44:22.131 --> 44:23.911
They're spreading out.

44:26.286 --> 44:28.506
They want to come from all sides.

44:28.791 --> 44:30.336
Then we better start shooting.

44:32.078 --> 44:33.088
Wait.

44:34.607 --> 44:35.617
Hold...

44:38.582 --> 44:39.582
Now!

44:42.791 --> 44:44.182
Ha!

45:18.751 --> 45:20.561
Aramis!

45:23.781 --> 45:24.953
Let's move!

45:29.367 --> 45:30.962
Take the King back to the palace.

45:30.987 --> 45:32.382
We'll cover you.

45:38.361 --> 45:39.381
On me!

45:58.471 --> 45:59.511
Stop!

46:00.661 --> 46:01.671
Philippe!

46:01.856 --> 46:03.176
Your Majesty.

46:06.924 --> 46:08.248
We need to move!

46:17.681 --> 46:18.711
Why?

46:28.337 --> 46:29.544
Your Majesty.

46:48.661 --> 46:50.232
Grimaud!

47:14.591 --> 47:17.513
It was Philippe who fired
the shot to warn us.

47:18.416 --> 47:20.526
He was a hero and a patriot.

47:24.511 --> 47:26.179
A true son of France.

47:37.331 --> 47:39.814
You will have no contact
with the Queen or the Dauphin.

47:41.581 --> 47:43.930
He is my son. Not yours.

47:45.128 --> 47:48.247
When he's frightened or
he falls, it is me he seeks.

47:49.328 --> 47:52.641
When he hears "Papa", it is
my face he sees, not yours.

47:55.601 --> 47:58.701
And I will see to it that
you play no part in his life.

48:00.711 --> 48:02.671
Even when I'm dead,

48:03.571 --> 48:05.531
you will not see him.

48:06.551 --> 48:08.521
I will make sure of that.

48:19.987 --> 48:22.383
Those not killed have fled,
Your Majesty,

48:22.891 --> 48:24.583
including their leader, Lucien Grimaud.

48:25.057 --> 48:26.560
I want him hunted down.

48:31.654 --> 48:32.744
Governor Feron?

48:36.807 --> 48:38.807
He died saving my life.

48:45.183 --> 48:47.989
He will have a full state funeral.
Nothing spared.

48:52.683 --> 48:54.563
Cover him, please.

48:55.869 --> 48:57.690
I will not have him be a spectacle.

49:26.969 --> 49:29.879
We're leaving. Saddle up.

49:45.505 --> 49:46.675
Feron is dead.

49:50.801 --> 49:52.095
Feron

49:53.904 --> 49:55.298
was a liability.

49:57.382 --> 49:58.643
It was you?

50:00.027 --> 50:02.334
I... I took no pleasure in it.

50:06.609 --> 50:09.022
But you did it, all the same.

50:13.067 --> 50:15.914
He would have got us
all caught and hung.

50:16.405 --> 50:17.455
You too.

50:19.027 --> 50:22.641
He said he would betray us,
before the King.

50:24.997 --> 50:26.547
If you're unhappy,

50:27.417 --> 50:28.637
then go.

50:30.414 --> 50:32.137
But nothing's changed.

50:32.957 --> 50:34.947
In a few months, Louis will be dead

50:35.217 --> 50:39.027
and I'll return to Paris with
Gaston at the head of an army.

50:40.077 --> 50:43.120
He will be the next King of France.

50:49.777 --> 50:52.482
I will have my men clear this area

50:53.787 --> 50:55.737
so that you can leave unnoticed.

51:11.826 --> 51:15.040
No, Gaston couldn't have escaped
the Bastille, not without help.

51:16.444 --> 51:17.484
Grimaud.

51:18.770 --> 51:20.775
What does Grimaud want with Gaston?

51:25.023 --> 51:26.322
The King...

51:27.316 --> 51:28.536
is dying.

51:31.890 --> 51:32.960
What?

51:34.341 --> 51:36.267
He told me today he's dying.

51:36.299 --> 51:37.551
He has...

51:38.367 --> 51:39.457
months to live.

51:44.722 --> 51:45.832
You knew?

51:49.790 --> 51:51.740
When were you going to tell me?

51:52.571 --> 51:54.267
When you needed to know.

51:54.292 --> 51:57.073
I would have put Gaston
under heavier guard.

51:57.567 --> 51:59.322
Now he's in the hands of Grimaud,

51:59.347 --> 52:01.936
primed to seize power
the moment Louis dies.

52:17.135 --> 52:20.221
Why does it have to
be a choice, me or France?

52:21.191 --> 52:24.409
Aren't you entitled to be
happy like every other man?

52:26.466 --> 52:27.756
I am a Musketeer.

52:28.292 --> 52:30.482
My duty is to the King and to France.

52:33.460 --> 52:35.500
I'm not asking you
to betray your country.

52:35.510 --> 52:37.880
Well, that's exactly
what I would be doing.

52:41.154 --> 52:43.660
Forces are gathering
that pose a grave threat.

52:44.111 --> 52:46.604
They must be defeated,
I cannot compromise that.

53:21.756 --> 53:24.054
I was afraid you hadn't got my message.

53:24.560 --> 53:25.600
He knows.

53:31.037 --> 53:33.335
He wanted me to admit
that I'd slept with you.

53:37.782 --> 53:39.620
The King will banish me.

53:40.093 --> 53:41.805
He'll take my son away from me.

53:42.288 --> 53:43.799
I don't believe he intends
to punish you...

53:43.824 --> 53:45.726
You don't know how things
have been between us.

53:45.751 --> 53:48.121
No. But I do know

53:48.490 --> 53:51.192
how men behave
when they are facing death.

53:52.879 --> 53:54.382
He...

53:55.095 --> 53:56.394
He is dying?

54:02.290 --> 54:03.420
He hadn't told you?

54:08.080 --> 54:10.224
You cannot afford weakness now.

54:11.226 --> 54:13.612
You are a Spanish Queen
in a French Court.

54:13.637 --> 54:15.677
Your enemies will plot against you.

54:16.460 --> 54:17.705
Prepare for it.

54:18.987 --> 54:23.197
You must be equal to their
challenge, for the sake of your son,

54:23.692 --> 54:24.752
for France.

54:33.798 --> 54:35.002
You're not alone.

54:51.937 --> 54:56.937
