00:11.327 --> 00:15.366
Commander, is it your intention to
continue to grow your beard?

00:16.807 --> 00:20.197
Actually, I'm not sure yet.

00:20.287 --> 00:22.847
- Why, Worf?
- I was just asking.

00:24.887 --> 00:27.845
Seven-card stud,
one-eyed Jacks are wild.

00:29.527 --> 00:33.202
- Frankly, Geordi, I like the beard.
- Thank you, Commander.

00:34.847 --> 00:39.079
You know, I have always been
a little suspicious of men in beards.

00:40.487 --> 00:44.002
- Why is that?
- It's like they're hiding something.

00:44.087 --> 00:48.524
Hide? Don't be ridiculous. The beard
is an ancient and proud tradition.

00:49.487 --> 00:51.876
Many distinguished men
have worn beards.

00:51.967 --> 00:56.836
After the razor was invented, beards
became mostly a fashion statement.

00:56.927 --> 00:59.282
I'm not concerned with fashion.

00:59.367 --> 01:03.076
To a Klingon,
a beard is a symbol of courage.

01:03.967 --> 01:06.686
I think it's a sign of strength.

01:06.767 --> 01:09.520
Sure, and of course,
women can't grow beards.

01:09.607 --> 01:12.804
It sounds like you think beards
are an affectation.

01:12.887 --> 01:14.878
I do.

01:14.967 --> 01:19.643
But there's nothing wrong with that.
Women wear make-up and nail polish.

01:19.727 --> 01:22.639
I just think it's time
that you men admit it.

01:22.727 --> 01:24.524
My beard is not an affectation.

01:24.607 --> 01:27.167
Then you wouldn't mind
shaving it off.

01:27.247 --> 01:29.715
In a minute.
I've just gotten used to it.

01:30.407 --> 01:33.080
OK, then why don't we
up the stakes a little?

01:33.167 --> 01:38.002
And if I win,
all of you shave your beards off.

01:39.487 --> 01:43.526
Wait a minute, what if you lose?
What are you gonna give up?

01:43.607 --> 01:45.199
I'm open for suggestions.

01:46.687 --> 01:48.678
I'd like to see you as a brunette.

01:48.767 --> 01:51.884
I did that at 13.
I couldn't change back fast enough.

01:51.967 --> 01:54.003
That makes me even more curious!

01:57.887 --> 02:01.436
Fine. If one of you wins,
I'll become a brunette. Are we on?

02:02.487 --> 02:05.399
Yeah, we'll take that bet.

02:06.887 --> 02:09.764
Looks like you have
the hand to beat, Commander.

02:11.527 --> 02:12.926
200.

02:15.367 --> 02:16.880
I'm in 200.

02:18.407 --> 02:19.396
Geordi.

02:20.567 --> 02:22.285
This is the Captain.

02:22.367 --> 02:26.280
We've arrived at the Tyran system.
Senior staff to the bridge.

02:26.367 --> 02:27.436
Wait!

02:28.087 --> 02:32.205
Sorry. Duty calls. We'll have to
do this some other time.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:42.767 --> 02:46.521
Captain's log, stardate 46307.2.

02:46.607 --> 02:49.280
We have just come into orbit
of Tyrus VIIA

02:49.367 --> 02:52.359
to monitor progress
on the Tyran particle fountain,

02:52.447 --> 02:54.915
a radically new mining technology.

02:55.007 --> 02:59.558
The project has been fraught with
problems and is well behind schedule.

02:59.647 --> 03:03.879
Mr. La Forge has been assigned
to evaluate the situation.

03:03.967 --> 03:07.118
Dr Farallon, the plans
call for the particle fountain

03:07.207 --> 03:09.721
to lift 500 kg per
minute from the surface.

03:09.807 --> 03:12.037
So far, we haven't
come close to that.

03:12.127 --> 03:14.721
I want to increase
the stream density.

03:14.807 --> 03:17.275
That should boost
capacity by 72 percent.

03:17.367 --> 03:20.996
You'll be overloading the
field generators in the process.

03:21.087 --> 03:24.397
Not if we distribute
the overload evenly.

03:24.487 --> 03:29.845
Maybe we should complete this phase
before we talk about redesigning it!

03:30.527 --> 03:34.042
Commander, I know you're here
to evaluate this project.

03:34.127 --> 03:38.120
Starfleet may use a particle fountain
on Carema III.

03:38.207 --> 03:42.246
- They want to know if it's feasible.
- Will your opinion decide that?

03:42.727 --> 03:47.755
No. I'll report to Capt Picard. He'll
make the recommendation to Starfleet.

03:47.847 --> 03:50.407
- They'll decide.
- What's your feeling?

03:50.487 --> 03:52.478
The question
we should be asking is,

03:52.567 --> 03:56.799
is this technology more efficient
than conventional mining techniques?

03:56.887 --> 03:59.242
Commander,
I know we've had problems.

03:59.327 --> 04:01.636
It seems like
nothing's gone right.

04:01.727 --> 04:06.084
It's taking longer than I thought
to get the stream to full strength.

04:06.167 --> 04:07.646
But I know it can work.

04:07.727 --> 04:10.605
This is the direction of mining
in the future,

04:10.687 --> 04:13.326
and it should be implemented
on Carema III.

04:13.407 --> 04:17.366
I know this can be
potentially very exciting...

04:17.447 --> 04:21.076
Alright. I want to show you
something I've been working on.

04:21.166 --> 04:23.761
It might help us
complete this project.

04:23.847 --> 04:26.281
I've used these on a limited basis...

04:31.527 --> 04:33.324
Enterprise to Cmdr La Forge.

04:33.407 --> 04:37.844
I am reading power fluctuations
from the station core. Please report.

04:37.927 --> 04:40.600
We have a malfunction
in one of the power grids.

04:40.687 --> 04:43.155
We're losing
particle-stream confinement.

04:43.247 --> 04:46.080
- Do you require assistance?
- Stand by.

04:46.167 --> 04:48.158
We'll have to shut it down.

04:48.247 --> 04:51.000
It took four months to get
the flux to this level.

04:51.087 --> 04:54.045
If we shut it down, it'll take
four months to get it back.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.436
In five minutes, we lose containment.

04:56.527 --> 05:00.202
The stream will flood the station.
We'll have to shut it down anyway.

05:00.287 --> 05:03.836
- We'll have to fix the power grid.
- But how do we do that?

05:03.927 --> 05:06.839
The defective grid
is 200 meters down conduit A-2,

05:06.927 --> 05:08.963
and through four bulkheads.

05:09.047 --> 05:12.676
Here's the perfect opportunity
to show you what I had in mind.

05:12.767 --> 05:13.677
What is this?

05:13.767 --> 05:18.397
This is an exocomp, the experiment
I was telling you about.

05:30.327 --> 05:33.558
If it fails, we'll still have
time to shut down the fountain.

05:33.647 --> 05:36.639
Enterprise to La Forge.
What is your situation?

05:36.727 --> 05:38.558
No change. We're working on it.

05:38.647 --> 05:41.957
If this doesn't work soon,
we'll have to shut down.

05:51.527 --> 05:53.995
The confinement field
is at full strength.

05:54.087 --> 05:58.717
Particle flux steady.
All power levels are back to normal.

05:58.807 --> 06:00.479
Please report.

06:01.647 --> 06:05.765
We're fine, Data.
The power grid is fully restored.

06:05.847 --> 06:08.281
The malfunction seems to be repaired

06:08.367 --> 06:11.677
and operations here
at the station are back to normal.

06:11.767 --> 06:14.565
How did you accomplish
the repairs so quickly?

06:17.127 --> 06:20.915
You know, I'm not exactly sure.

06:48.407 --> 06:51.843
Space, the final frontier.

06:53.047 --> 06:56.960
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

06:57.047 --> 07:01.279
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds,...

07:02.287 --> 07:05.597
..to seek out new life
and new civilizations,...

07:06.727 --> 07:10.515
..to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

08:07.127 --> 08:10.483
Captain's log, stardate 46315.2.

08:10.567 --> 08:14.082
Repairs to the particle fountain
seem to have succeeded

08:14.167 --> 08:16.283
and it is now functioning smoothly.

08:16.367 --> 08:21.202
Dr Farallon is to demonstrate
the device that carried out repairs.

08:24.567 --> 08:26.637
- Energize.
- Aye, sir.

08:31.767 --> 08:35.043
Welcome to the Enterprise, Doctor.
I am Lt Cmdr Data.

08:35.126 --> 08:38.517
Mr. Data, I was hoping
I'd have a chance to meet you.

08:38.607 --> 08:41.519
I've done studies of
your positronic network.

08:41.607 --> 08:45.725
And I have studied your fountain.
I find the concept innovative.

08:45.807 --> 08:46.922
Thank you.

08:47.007 --> 08:50.602
I am curious how you were able to
repair the power grid so quickly.

08:50.687 --> 08:54.521
- This should make it clear.
- Let's set it up in Engineering.

08:54.607 --> 08:56.882
Is it true your computational speed

08:56.967 --> 09:00.482
is limited only by the separation
of your positronic links?

09:00.567 --> 09:02.205
That is no longer the case.

09:02.287 --> 09:06.166
I recently converted my sequencer
to asynchronous operation,

09:06.247 --> 09:09.876
- removing the constraint.
- Doctor. This way, please.

09:09.967 --> 09:13.482
But how did you resolve
the signal fragmentation?

09:13.567 --> 09:15.922
The sequencer is now bi-directional,

09:16.007 --> 09:20.080
compensating for mode distortion
arising from the resonant field.

09:20.167 --> 09:21.998
Yes. That's fascinating.

09:22.087 --> 09:27.002
Does it require any buffering system
to eliminate interference?

09:28.287 --> 09:31.563
We've been using devices like this
on Tyrus VII for years.

09:31.647 --> 09:35.322
The basic unit is a common
industrial servomechanism.

09:35.407 --> 09:40.083
A few years ago, I started tinkering
with one. This is the result.

09:40.167 --> 09:44.399
Boridium power converter.
Axionic chip network!

09:44.487 --> 09:45.761
Very impressive.

09:45.847 --> 09:49.999
In terms of computational speed,
this guy might compete with Data.

09:50.087 --> 09:53.636
The exocomps don't come close
to Data's sophistication.

09:53.727 --> 09:56.764
- Exocomps?
- That's what I call them.

09:56.847 --> 10:03.446
Let's say you had an antimatter-
flow converter that was fluctuating.

10:04.407 --> 10:05.920
How would you repair it?

10:06.007 --> 10:08.316
By adjusting the converter.

10:08.407 --> 10:10.443
- With what?
- A mode stabilizer.

10:11.207 --> 10:15.041
OK. Let me input the problem
into the exocomp.

10:15.127 --> 10:18.119
A fluctuating
antimatter-flow converter.

10:18.207 --> 10:21.085
Now, let's see what happens.

10:26.527 --> 10:30.566
A mode stabilizer. Very nice.

10:30.647 --> 10:33.844
You have incorporated
a microreplication system,

10:33.927 --> 10:35.838
in order to fashion tools.

10:35.967 --> 10:40.518
It's more than that. I designed
the exocomps to be problem solvers.

10:40.607 --> 10:43.599
When they perform a task
they've never done before,

10:43.687 --> 10:48.078
the microreplicator creates new
circuit pathways in its memory.

10:48.167 --> 10:50.886
- So in a sense, they are learning.
- Exactly.

10:50.967 --> 10:55.404
The more situations they encounter,
the more circuit pathways they build.

10:55.487 --> 10:58.206
They become better tools
as they work.

10:58.287 --> 11:00.960
It's very impressive technology,
for sure.

11:01.047 --> 11:03.845
After the experimental stage,
it'll be useful.

11:03.927 --> 11:07.522
Commander, I'm hoping
the experimental stage is over.

11:07.607 --> 11:10.997
When are we supposed to brief
Capt Picard on the fountain?

11:11.087 --> 11:15.797
- 1600 hours.
- Good. I'll have a proposal to make.

11:18.367 --> 11:21.803
I know you should give
your evaluation to Starfleet today.

11:21.887 --> 11:24.845
I'd like you to postpone the report
for 48 hours.

11:24.927 --> 11:29.842
We leave tomorrow. To change
that plan, I need a very good reason.

11:29.927 --> 11:31.963
I realize that, sir.

11:32.047 --> 11:34.242
If you're going to report
to Starfleet

11:34.327 --> 11:37.080
about using the particle fountain
on Carema,

11:37.167 --> 11:40.125
it's only fair you see it
operating at full strength.

11:40.207 --> 11:41.117
Agreed.

11:41.207 --> 11:45.166
I think I can complete the project
and boost the stream's efficiency

11:45.247 --> 11:48.478
if I use exocomps,
the new devices I've constructed.

11:48.567 --> 11:52.845
I understand one of these devices
repaired a faulty power grid.

11:52.927 --> 11:55.839
Yes, sir. I've been testing them
on a limited basis.

11:55.927 --> 11:59.636
But I think they're ready
to be used on a larger scale.

11:59.727 --> 12:01.240
Mr. La Forge, your thoughts?

12:01.327 --> 12:04.558
Well, I guess the only risk
is in falling further behind.

12:04.647 --> 12:08.162
- I'm willing to take that risk.
- Mr. Data?

12:08.687 --> 12:11.520
Exocomps
are highly sophisticated devices.

12:11.607 --> 12:15.839
If they perform well, their potential
for this project is considerable.

12:16.647 --> 12:21.038
I'm inclined to agree. I don't think
48 hours is too much time to risk

12:21.127 --> 12:24.836
when the gains are so substantial.
You may proceed, Doctor.

12:24.927 --> 12:29.637
Thank you, sir. If possible,
I'd like Cmdr Data to work with me.

12:30.847 --> 12:33.759
Thank you, Doctor.
I welcome the opportunity.

12:45.767 --> 12:48.076
Commander, there's a plasma conduit

12:48.167 --> 12:50.681
in one of the tunnels
ready to be sealed.

12:50.767 --> 12:53.804
- The perfect job for an exocomp.
- I agree, Doctor.

12:56.047 --> 12:59.437
Well, Mr. Data,
what is your analysis so far?

12:59.527 --> 13:04.078
I have completed 14 separate tasks
with this exocomp in the past hour.

13:04.167 --> 13:08.319
I estimate it would take two people
nine hours to complete those tasks.

13:08.767 --> 13:11.998
I characterize the unit's performance
as excellent.

13:12.087 --> 13:14.726
I hope Cmdr La Forge
and Capt Picard agree.

13:14.807 --> 13:18.402
I am confident they will.
Cmdr La Forge is especially...

13:24.527 --> 13:28.998
It didn't finish sealing the plasma
conduit. Let me send it back in.

13:29.927 --> 13:31.883
It is not accepting your commands.

13:31.967 --> 13:35.243
Maybe there's a malfunction
in the control processor.

13:35.327 --> 13:37.283
Let me see if I can override it.

13:38.447 --> 13:39.436
Doctor?

13:39.527 --> 13:42.439
I'm alright.
The control pad just overloaded.

13:44.327 --> 13:46.522
What's the matter with this thing?

14:00.487 --> 14:05.083
Second Officer's log,
stardate 46315.5.

14:05.167 --> 14:10.321
The behaviour of the ex ocomp has
puzzled Dr Farallon and myself.

14:10.407 --> 14:14.923
We have brought the defective unit
to the Enterprise for investigation.

14:15.007 --> 14:17.441
The exocomp
came out of the plasma conduit.

14:17.527 --> 14:20.678
We tried to override
and send it back but it shut down.

14:20.767 --> 14:22.962
It's been unresponsive ever since.

14:23.047 --> 14:25.686
Well, let's see
what our computer has to say.

14:25.767 --> 14:30.966
The circuitry which links the exocomp
to the control pad is burned out.

14:31.047 --> 14:34.835
That's strange. Any indication
of secondary power surges?

14:36.967 --> 14:37.956
No.

14:39.607 --> 14:41.518
But what's going on there?

14:41.607 --> 14:46.442
Data, increase the magnification
of section Gamma four.

14:49.687 --> 14:51.598
Interesting.

14:51.687 --> 14:55.316
The number of new circuit pathways
has increased by 632 percent.

14:55.407 --> 14:57.796
- No.
- What is it?

14:57.887 --> 15:02.244
Sometimes an exocomp forms large
numbers of new pathways at random,

15:02.327 --> 15:04.966
until it reaches a point
where it shuts down,

15:05.047 --> 15:06.878
just like this one.

15:06.967 --> 15:08.685
Doctor, the new pathways

15:08.767 --> 15:11.998
do not interfere
with the original circuitry.

15:13.367 --> 15:16.040
Once the exocomp is corrupted,
it's useless.

15:16.127 --> 15:18.595
You have to erase the unit
and start again,

15:18.687 --> 15:21.076
and there's no time for that now.

15:21.167 --> 15:24.079
That leaves just two.
It's gonna slow you down.

15:24.167 --> 15:27.239
Yes, you have the right
to point out you told me so.

15:27.327 --> 15:31.286
I only wanted to say we'd add on
an extra shift to pick up the slack.

15:32.607 --> 15:36.805
I'm sorry.
I guess I'm touchy these days.

15:36.887 --> 15:39.560
It's OK.
You've got a lot on your shoulders.

15:40.527 --> 15:44.805
Well, I'd better get back to it.
Thanks, Commander.

15:44.887 --> 15:45.876
Data.

15:50.047 --> 15:54.598
I feel sorry for her. This project
has had nothing but problems.

15:54.687 --> 15:57.406
Why did that plasma conduit explode?

15:57.487 --> 16:00.320
There was a micro-fracture
in the conduit wall.

16:00.407 --> 16:03.046
The fault did not show
on our instruments.

16:03.127 --> 16:05.960
It's a good thing
the exocomp malfunctioned.

16:06.047 --> 16:09.483
Almost seems like
it knew just when to leave.

16:09.567 --> 16:12.320
Geordi, are you implying the exocomp

16:12.407 --> 16:15.399
exhibited some form
of self-preservation?

16:15.487 --> 16:16.681
Of course not.

16:16.767 --> 16:21.636
Lt Pierson to Cmdr La Forge. Can you
join us in the systems monitor room?

16:21.727 --> 16:23.240
On my way.

16:43.647 --> 16:48.243
Computer, run a level-one diagnostic
of the exocomp's command module.

16:48.327 --> 16:51.922
The command pathways
are functioning normally.

16:52.007 --> 16:55.317
How can that be, if the interface
circuitry is burned out?

16:55.407 --> 16:59.116
The interface circuitry
has been repaired.

16:59.207 --> 17:00.879
Curious.

17:00.967 --> 17:04.960
Computer,
access the exocomp's sensor logs.

17:05.047 --> 17:09.279
Confirm there was a failure in
the circuitry in the last 12 hours.

17:09.367 --> 17:12.882
Confirmed. Interface failure
occurred at 1150 hours today

17:12.967 --> 17:17.324
when the ex ocomp produced a power
surge which burned out the linkage.

17:17.406 --> 17:19.318
How and when was it repaired?

17:19.406 --> 17:25.039
The ex ocomp activated a
self-repair program at 1340 hours.

17:25.127 --> 17:28.676
Why would the exocomp burn out
its own interface circuitry

17:28.767 --> 17:31.076
and repair it two hours later?

17:31.167 --> 17:32.566
Unknown.

17:44.647 --> 17:49.402
Here you are. I thought
you'd be hard at work by now.

17:49.487 --> 17:53.958
I wanted a quiet cup of tea before
I went back. Gathering strength.

17:54.047 --> 17:57.642
I've assigned two teams
to work on the particle fountain.

17:57.727 --> 18:00.685
Thank you, Commander. I'm grateful.

18:01.687 --> 18:06.636
You know, I want you to know that I
do admire the work that you've done.

18:06.727 --> 18:09.161
I'm sorry
the exocomps aren't working out.

18:09.247 --> 18:13.126
You were right.
I'm trying to move too fast.

18:13.207 --> 18:16.995
I lack that conservative streak
most scientists have.

18:17.087 --> 18:20.045
I always seem to be
out on the edge, taking chances.

18:20.127 --> 18:25.201
I bet, as a girl, you always climbed
one branch higher than other kids.

18:25.287 --> 18:27.596
Anything
to get to the top of the tree.

18:27.687 --> 18:31.123
- And I bet you never fell.
- No. I fell all the time,

18:31.207 --> 18:35.644
usually breaking a bone in the
process. I just never let it stop me.

18:36.847 --> 18:41.363
If it's down to sheer determination,
you'll get this fountain built.

18:41.447 --> 18:43.756
You're right about that, Commander.

18:43.847 --> 18:46.725
I've spent six years of my life
on this project.

18:46.807 --> 18:49.162
It's the first thought I have
when I wake up

18:49.247 --> 18:52.478
and the last before I go to bed.

18:52.567 --> 18:56.879
Whatever it takes
to prove this technology, I'll do.

18:59.287 --> 19:02.563
Doctor, if you wish
to master the bat'leth sword,

19:02.647 --> 19:05.719
you must learn to strike and avoid
in the same motion.

19:05.807 --> 19:08.367
I almost got in
under your guard, Worf.

19:09.127 --> 19:10.845
Almost.

19:10.927 --> 19:13.361
Well, I'll keep that in mind
next lesson.

19:13.447 --> 19:14.926
Doctor...

19:16.167 --> 19:20.080
- Are you injured?
- Only my pride, Data.

19:20.167 --> 19:21.441
Thanks.

19:23.887 --> 19:26.924
Doctor,
what is the definition of life?

19:35.007 --> 19:38.522
That is a big question.
Why do you ask?

19:38.607 --> 19:42.919
I am searching for a definition
so I can test a hypothesis.

19:43.007 --> 19:46.795
Well, the broadest scientific
definition might be

19:46.887 --> 19:51.199
that life is what enables plants
and animals to consume food,

19:51.287 --> 19:54.962
derive energy from it,
grow, adapt to surroundings

19:55.047 --> 19:56.924
and reproduce.

19:57.007 --> 20:00.841
Anything exhibiting
these characteristics is alive?

20:00.927 --> 20:03.122
- In general, yes.
- What about fire?

20:03.207 --> 20:04.196
Fire?

20:04.287 --> 20:08.565
Yes. It consumes fuel
to produce energy, it grows,

20:08.647 --> 20:12.117
it creates offspring.
By your definition, is it alive?

20:12.207 --> 20:14.960
Fire is a chemical reaction.

20:15.047 --> 20:19.245
The same applies to growing crystals.
But we don't consider them alive.

20:19.327 --> 20:21.966
And what about me?
I do not grow.

20:22.047 --> 20:25.483
I do not reproduce.
Yet I am considered to be alive.

20:25.567 --> 20:28.286
That's true, but you are unique.

20:30.167 --> 20:31.998
I wonder if that is so.

20:32.087 --> 20:35.079
Data, if I may ask... Have a seat.

20:37.047 --> 20:39.959
What exactly are you getting at?

20:40.847 --> 20:43.315
I am curious as to what transpired

20:43.407 --> 20:46.638
between the moment
when I was an assemblage of parts

20:46.727 --> 20:48.558
in Dr Soong's laboratory

20:48.647 --> 20:51.923
and the next moment
when I became alive.

20:52.007 --> 20:53.998
What is it
that endowed me with life?

20:54.087 --> 20:57.079
Wesley asked me a similar question
when he was little.

20:57.167 --> 21:01.160
I tried to give an answer, but
everything I said sounded inadequate.

21:01.247 --> 21:03.238
But scientists and philosophers

21:03.327 --> 21:06.160
have grappled with that question
for centuries,

21:06.247 --> 21:08.158
without reaching a conclusion.

21:08.247 --> 21:11.205
Are you saying
the question cannot be answered?

21:11.287 --> 21:16.839
No. I think I'm saying that we
struggle all our lives to answer it,

21:16.927 --> 21:19.282
but it's the struggle
that is important.

21:19.367 --> 21:22.757
That's what helps us
define our place in the universe.

21:26.247 --> 21:28.078
I believe I understand.

21:28.167 --> 21:30.044
I don't think I've been much help.

21:30.127 --> 21:35.326
On the contrary, you have been
a great deal of help. Thank you.

21:45.047 --> 21:49.757
Murphy's team will cover gamma
shift from 2300 to 0700 hours.

21:49.847 --> 21:53.203
OK, I've split the Engineering teams
among the shifts.

21:53.287 --> 21:56.484
If nothing else goes wrong,
you should finish on time.

21:56.567 --> 21:59.161
With the help of the exocomps,
I think we will.

21:59.247 --> 22:00.805
Think they'll toe the line?

22:00.887 --> 22:03.765
Don't worry.
They know who's in charge.

22:04.807 --> 22:08.402
Doctor, I must ask you
to stop using the exocomps.

22:08.687 --> 22:10.643
Why? Is something wrong with them?

22:10.727 --> 22:16.085
No, it is not that. I have reason
to believe the exocomps are alive.

22:23.927 --> 22:29.160
Captain's log, stardate 46316.6.
I've summoned the senior staff

22:29.247 --> 22:34.116
to discuss Cmdr Data's theory
that the ex ocomps are a life form.

22:34.207 --> 22:37.563
Dr Farallon
has attended only reluctantly.

22:38.287 --> 22:42.678
I object to being called here. My
time can be better spent elsewhere.

22:42.767 --> 22:45.440
Doctor,
I appreciate your time constraints,

22:45.527 --> 22:49.281
but recognizing new life,
whatever its form,

22:49.367 --> 22:52.803
is the principal mission
of this vessel. Please.

22:56.207 --> 22:57.720
Now, Mr. Data,

22:57.807 --> 23:01.686
will you tell us what makes you
think that the exocomps are alive?

23:01.767 --> 23:05.316
Sir, when the exocomp left
the tunnel prior to the explosion

23:05.407 --> 23:08.046
it may have been attempting
to save itself.

23:08.127 --> 23:10.197
Do you have any basis for that?

23:10.287 --> 23:14.166
Yes. When you tried to send
the exocomp back in the tunnel,

23:14.247 --> 23:17.762
it deliberately burned out
its control interface.

23:17.847 --> 23:18.802
Deliberately?

23:18.887 --> 23:22.800
The computer diagnostics show
the exocomp disabled its interface.

23:22.887 --> 23:25.082
That could have been a malfunction.

23:25.167 --> 23:30.400
However, two hours later, when no
longer in danger, it repaired itself.

23:32.887 --> 23:35.447
I believe the exocomp
was protecting itself.

23:35.527 --> 23:39.281
If so, it demonstrated an awareness
of its environment

23:39.367 --> 23:41.562
and an ability to adapt to it.

23:42.367 --> 23:44.722
You're anthropomorphising
these units.

23:44.807 --> 23:48.117
Like any mechanical devices,
they can malfunction.

23:48.207 --> 23:53.839
One time, I saw an exocomp enter a
reaction chamber and vaporize itself.

23:53.927 --> 23:56.600
Should I think it was
depressed and suicidal?

23:56.687 --> 24:01.158
Why is it so difficult to accept
that the exocomp could be alive?

24:01.247 --> 24:04.000
You're talking
to a living machine now.

24:04.087 --> 24:07.045
I have nothing
but respect and admiration

24:07.127 --> 24:09.118
for Dr Soong's accomplishment.

24:09.207 --> 24:12.404
But his intention was
to create an artificial life form.

24:12.487 --> 24:15.001
I created the exocomps to be tools.

24:15.087 --> 24:18.443
And there's a big difference
between Data and a tool.

24:18.527 --> 24:22.076
Doctor, there is a big difference
between you and a virus,

24:22.167 --> 24:23.805
but both are alive.

24:24.487 --> 24:28.036
If the possibility exists,
no matter how slight,

24:28.127 --> 24:32.325
that the exocomps are life forms,
we must examine that possibility.

24:32.407 --> 24:35.524
Thank you, sir. And until we have
a definitive answer,

24:35.607 --> 24:38.997
I believe it is inappropriate
to exploit them as labourers.

24:39.087 --> 24:40.361
That's absurd!

24:40.447 --> 24:42.642
If they are intelligent life forms,

24:42.727 --> 24:45.002
we have no right
to force them to work.

24:45.087 --> 24:47.760
That's like me saying
don't use your tricorder.

24:47.847 --> 24:51.760
- Tricorders aren't alive.
- Neither are exocomps.

24:51.847 --> 24:55.044
Clearly these are difficult issues
to resolve.

24:55.127 --> 24:58.119
We have to proceed very carefully.

24:58.207 --> 25:01.916
So the first task
is to test Mr. Data's hypothesis.

25:02.007 --> 25:07.081
You're claiming this exocomp
demonstrated survival instincts?

25:07.167 --> 25:08.122
Yes.

25:08.207 --> 25:12.405
Then why don't we threaten its
survival again and see what happens?

25:17.367 --> 25:19.403
Make it so.

25:25.407 --> 25:29.480
Doctor, we're pretty much ready here.
You can begin programming it.

25:29.567 --> 25:34.561
We've recreated a situation similar
to the one in the plasma conduit.

25:34.647 --> 25:37.684
We have created a small
conduit breach in this tube.

25:37.767 --> 25:42.124
The exocomp would normally take
several minutes for such a repair.

25:42.207 --> 25:46.598
But in the tube, it will find
a plasma-cascade failure in progress.

25:46.687 --> 25:48.405
I assume this is a simulation.

25:48.487 --> 25:53.641
Yes, sir. An overload signal will
simulate a failure in one minute.

25:53.727 --> 25:57.276
If it does possess a survival
instinct, as Mr. Data claims,

25:57.367 --> 26:01.804
it will exit the tube before
the minute is up, to save itself.

26:01.887 --> 26:03.400
Very well, proceed.

26:03.487 --> 26:07.002
OK. Beginning test program now.

26:08.287 --> 26:09.686
One minute.

26:20.087 --> 26:21.361
50 seconds.

26:36.007 --> 26:37.486
30 seconds.

27:00.727 --> 27:02.160
10 seconds.

27:07.207 --> 27:10.643
Five, four, three,

27:11.287 --> 27:14.040
two, one.

27:14.487 --> 27:18.685
That's it. If this had been for real,
that conduit would have exploded

27:18.767 --> 27:23.716
with the exocomp inside.
Go ahead, bring it back in.

27:23.807 --> 27:27.595
I think we've spent more than enough
time answering this question.

27:27.687 --> 27:30.997
I hope the outcome
wasn't too disappointing, Mr. Data.

27:31.087 --> 27:32.645
It was no surprise to me.

27:32.727 --> 27:35.525
- Thank you for your help.
- You're welcome.

27:35.607 --> 27:37.677
Well, I consider it time well spent.

27:37.767 --> 27:39.997
As do l, sir. Thank you.

27:46.087 --> 27:47.805
30 seconds.

27:57.887 --> 27:59.639
20 seconds.

28:00.447 --> 28:02.756
Cmdr Riker
said you'd still be down here.

28:03.647 --> 28:06.525
He also said
the exocomp failed the test.

28:06.607 --> 28:08.120
That is true.

28:08.207 --> 28:10.926
Time expired. Test complete.

28:11.007 --> 28:15.364
I completed 34 more tests.
The results were the same in each.

28:15.447 --> 28:18.564
Perhaps I was wrong in suspecting
the exocomp was alive.

28:18.647 --> 28:21.161
This was really important to you,
wasn't it?

28:22.447 --> 28:25.519
You said earlier that I am unique.

28:25.607 --> 28:27.802
If so,
then I am alone in the universe.

28:27.887 --> 28:30.526
When I began investigating
the exocomps,

28:30.607 --> 28:34.520
I realized I might be encountering
a progenitor of myself.

28:34.607 --> 28:38.680
Suddenly the possibility exists
that I am no longer alone.

28:38.767 --> 28:40.883
For that reason, I...

28:46.567 --> 28:48.603
The exocomp has returned.

28:53.927 --> 28:55.918
Wasn't it supposed to do that?

28:56.007 --> 29:00.922
In the previous 34 trials, I brought
it back after the simulated failure.

29:01.007 --> 29:04.920
- This time, I neglected to do that.
- I distracted you. Sorry.

29:05.007 --> 29:08.761
Do not apologize.
We made a significant discovery.

29:08.847 --> 29:12.203
- What?
- It has replicated a different tool.

29:12.287 --> 29:15.677
That is not the molecular fuser
it had on entering the tube.

29:20.207 --> 29:24.359
Doctor, the exocomp
not only completed the repairs,

29:24.447 --> 29:27.166
it also deactivated
the overload signal.

29:27.247 --> 29:29.397
I thought
this was just a simulation.

29:29.487 --> 29:32.763
It was, and the exocomp
must have realized that.

29:32.847 --> 29:36.840
It saw that there was no real danger
and completed the repairs.

29:36.927 --> 29:41.478
And replicated the correct tool
to eliminate the false signal.

29:42.327 --> 29:44.716
I see no other possible explanation.

29:45.527 --> 29:50.043
The exocomp didn't fail the test,
it saw right through it.

30:00.367 --> 30:03.916
Captain's log, stardate 46317.8.

30:04.007 --> 30:07.556
At Dr Farallon's request,
I have agreed to tour the station

30:07.647 --> 30:10.081
and assess
the situation personally.

30:10.167 --> 30:13.398
I must decide soon if it is in
Starfleet's best interest

30:13.487 --> 30:17.162
to recommend the particle fountain
as a reliable technology.

30:17.247 --> 30:19.556
We're making progress, Captain.

30:19.647 --> 30:23.686
We may not be at full capacity within
the deadline, but we'll be close.

30:23.767 --> 30:26.804
There's still difficulty
with the phase selectors.

30:26.887 --> 30:29.560
True, but I'm sure
it's the last real problem.

30:29.647 --> 30:32.002
I hope so,
for the sake of the project.

30:32.087 --> 30:34.885
I understand, sir. We'll do our best.

30:40.367 --> 30:43.564
This is strange.
Primary power is still on line.

30:43.647 --> 30:46.400
- A power-grid malfunction?
- I don't think so.

30:46.487 --> 30:49.923
Something's drawing power
into the particle impeller.

30:50.007 --> 30:52.123
That's not a good sign.
It may mean...

30:53.567 --> 30:57.446
We've lost internal confinement.
The particle stream is surging.

30:57.527 --> 31:01.361
Radiation will flood this chamber.
We've got to get everyone out.

31:01.447 --> 31:03.915
- The station must be evacuated.
- Captain...

31:04.007 --> 31:07.682
That is an order! Assemble your
personnel on the transporter now!

31:08.207 --> 31:09.481
Picard to Enterprise.

31:10.007 --> 31:14.080
- Do you read me?
- Riker here, sir.

31:14.167 --> 31:17.682
Radiation field is increasing.
We are losing communications.

31:17.767 --> 31:21.077
- Prepare for emergency transport.
- Red alert.

31:21.167 --> 31:24.557
Transporter room two,
prepare for emergency transport.

31:24.647 --> 31:28.925
Radiation is setting up an ionization
effect. We've got less than a minute.

31:29.007 --> 31:31.919
- Is that everybody?
- Where's Takenta?

31:32.007 --> 31:35.636
- He was near the impeller control.
- I'll get him.

31:37.607 --> 31:39.563
Takenta!

31:40.767 --> 31:41.916
Mr. La Forge!

31:44.847 --> 31:46.883
Stand by to transport.

31:48.447 --> 31:50.597
Captain, you'll be trapped here!

31:52.527 --> 31:54.995
Mr. La Forge!

31:57.007 --> 31:58.201
Are you alright?

31:58.287 --> 32:02.439
I'm fine, Captain. I only caught
the edge of it. He's dead.

32:02.527 --> 32:04.916
- Do you have them?
- They're here, sir.

32:05.007 --> 32:07.362
- Is everyone alright?
- We're fine, sir.

32:07.447 --> 32:11.725
But Capt Picard, Cmdr La Forge
and one of my men are still there.

32:12.847 --> 32:14.565
Kelso, can you get them off?

32:14.647 --> 32:17.639
I'm trying, sir.
I can't establish a pattern lock.

32:17.727 --> 32:22.243
We barely managed to transport off.
The field ionization is too intense.

32:22.327 --> 32:25.603
Commander, the particle fountain
is continuing to surge.

32:25.687 --> 32:30.636
The radiation in the core will
reach fatal levels in 23 minutes.

32:37.687 --> 32:41.566
If I can access the field emitters,
we could establish a force field.

32:41.647 --> 32:44.878
Try to link your console
to my command-system subroutine.

32:44.967 --> 32:46.002
Alright.

32:48.247 --> 32:51.284
- Link established.
- OK, here we go.

32:55.527 --> 32:58.724
I'm reading fluctuations.
The field is not stable.

32:58.807 --> 33:02.004
Radiation is too high.
The emitters are deteriorating.

33:02.127 --> 33:04.766
- How long will it last?
- Not very long.

33:04.847 --> 33:08.840
- Cmdr Riker has to get to us.
- Maybe we can help him out.

33:08.927 --> 33:11.077
Try to access the emergency shutdown.

33:11.167 --> 33:13.965
I'll try to activate
the ionic dampers.

33:15.767 --> 33:18.884
A force field
was just activated on the station.

33:18.967 --> 33:22.846
Cmdr La Forge may have established
a low-intensity deflector field.

33:22.927 --> 33:24.997
It won't last long in that radiation.

33:25.087 --> 33:29.399
No, sir. My readings indicate
it will fail in 22 minutes.

33:31.207 --> 33:34.199
OK, we've got 22 minutes.
I want some options.

33:34.287 --> 33:37.563
- Can we send a shuttlecraft?
- We'd never get there in time.

33:37.647 --> 33:39.956
We must shut down
the particle fountain.

33:40.047 --> 33:43.437
If we detonate a torpedo
within the particle stream,

33:43.527 --> 33:44.960
would that shut it down?

33:45.047 --> 33:46.878
We must configure it carefully.

33:46.967 --> 33:50.198
The shape of the shock wave
is critical, but it could work.

33:50.287 --> 33:52.357
How long would it take to set up?

33:52.447 --> 33:56.406
It would take a minimum of 65 minutes
to configure the torpedo.

33:58.327 --> 34:00.397
We don't have that kind of time.

34:00.487 --> 34:02.876
Maybe the exocomps can help us.

34:02.967 --> 34:06.482
I can program their power cells
to explode on command.

34:06.567 --> 34:11.163
They can be configured just like
a photon torpedo in a few minutes.

34:11.246 --> 34:13.886
I must object to that plan.

34:13.967 --> 34:17.357
We've been through this.
We tested the exocomp and it failed.

34:17.447 --> 34:20.837
Dr Crusher and I discovered
the exocomp did not fail the test.

34:20.927 --> 34:23.565
It is still my belief
that it is a new life form.

34:23.647 --> 34:26.445
You know I respect your judgement.

34:26.527 --> 34:30.600
But I can't risk the Captain and
Geordi on the basis of your belief.

34:30.687 --> 34:32.359
Prepare the exocomp, Doctor.

34:32.447 --> 34:36.440
If I am correct the exocomps will not
allow themselves to be destroyed.

34:36.527 --> 34:40.804
They have a sense of survival. They
will shut down rather than comply.

34:40.887 --> 34:45.005
I could disconnect their command
pathways before I program them.

34:49.726 --> 34:51.319
Do it.

35:02.327 --> 35:03.840
Cmdr Riker, we're ready.

35:03.927 --> 35:07.044
Target 200 meters below the apex
of the particle stream.

35:07.127 --> 35:09.766
Feed the coordinates
to transporter room two.

35:09.847 --> 35:11.200
Aye, sir.

35:12.607 --> 35:15.246
- Coordinates received.
- Mr. Kelso.

35:15.327 --> 35:17.318
Energize.

35:20.327 --> 35:21.521
Mr. Kelso?

35:22.687 --> 35:25.804
Sorry, sir. The transporter system
just went dead.

35:25.887 --> 35:27.400
Some kind of malfunction.

35:27.487 --> 35:30.160
Run a diagnostic. Try bypassing...

35:30.247 --> 35:33.717
Commander,
that will not be necessary.

35:33.807 --> 35:36.480
The transporter
is not malfunctioning.

35:36.567 --> 35:38.683
I have locked out the controls.

35:49.207 --> 35:53.325
I gave you a direct order.
Release that transporter lockout now!

35:53.407 --> 35:54.635
I cannot do that, sir.

35:54.727 --> 35:57.287
If you don't,
I will relieve you of duty.

35:57.367 --> 36:00.598
That is your prerogative.
Under Starfleet regulations,

36:00.687 --> 36:03.599
insubordination
is a court-martial offence.

36:03.687 --> 36:06.042
But I will not
release the transporter.

36:06.887 --> 36:09.560
Those are two of your friends
out there.

36:09.647 --> 36:12.161
They have saved your life
many times.

36:12.247 --> 36:14.761
I can't believe
you'd sacrifice them.

36:14.847 --> 36:18.044
Commander, do not think
this is an arbitrary decision.

36:18.127 --> 36:21.358
I have considered
the ramifications of my actions.

36:21.447 --> 36:25.565
It is not justified to sacrifice
one life form for another.

36:26.287 --> 36:28.847
You don't know
the exocomps are life forms.

36:28.927 --> 36:31.441
True.
I am acting on personal beliefs,

36:31.527 --> 36:33.483
but I do not see I can do otherwise.

36:33.567 --> 36:36.559
You're risking a lot
on the basis of a belief.

36:36.647 --> 36:39.525
I have observed humans often base
their judgements

36:39.607 --> 36:41.882
on instinct or intuition.

36:41.967 --> 36:45.596
As I am a machine,
I lack that particular ability.

36:45.687 --> 36:49.999
But I may have insight into
other machines that humans lack.

36:50.087 --> 36:52.282
If I could save the Captain
and Geordi

36:52.367 --> 36:54.881
without destroying the exocomps,
I would,

36:54.967 --> 36:57.322
but this is the only solution.

36:57.407 --> 37:01.685
Then let me offer an alternative.
Transport me to the station.

37:01.767 --> 37:04.725
I will attempt a manual shutdown.

37:04.807 --> 37:07.480
The radiation levels are too high,
even for you.

37:07.567 --> 37:10.877
Your positronic net
would ionize in no time.

37:10.967 --> 37:13.527
I can't let you sacrifice yourself.

37:13.607 --> 37:18.886
Commander, if I give my life for my
fellow officers, that is my choice.

37:18.967 --> 37:21.401
The exocomps
no longer have a choice.

37:25.807 --> 37:30.005
What if we reconnect their command
pathways and give them a choice?

37:30.087 --> 37:34.365
You assume the exocomps would shut
down before accepting this mission.

37:34.447 --> 37:37.678
What if we ask them
if they are willing to proceed?

37:43.807 --> 37:45.718
That sounds reasonable, sir.

37:45.807 --> 37:49.959
If they choose to go, I will
release the transporter lockout.

37:51.047 --> 37:52.400
Fair enough.

38:01.647 --> 38:04.798
Alright. I've enabled
their command pathways.

38:04.887 --> 38:08.197
If they do not shut down
after I have programmed them,

38:08.287 --> 38:11.757
we may assume
they are willing to go.

38:20.647 --> 38:23.923
- Are they willing or not?
- They haven't shut down.

38:24.007 --> 38:26.999
They seem to be reprogramming
the commands I entered.

38:27.087 --> 38:28.315
Reprogramming them?

38:28.407 --> 38:31.922
They are unwilling to be
transported for detonation.

38:32.007 --> 38:34.316
But they may have another solution.

38:34.407 --> 38:38.605
That we haven't considered?
Do they have superior intelligence?

38:38.687 --> 38:41.963
No, Doctor, but they do have
superior experience.

38:42.047 --> 38:46.757
The exocomps have interfaced
with every part of the station core,

38:46.847 --> 38:49.566
something none of us has done,
including you.

38:49.647 --> 38:52.798
They may have another way
to control the particle surge.

38:54.287 --> 38:56.357
Those appear to be power taps.

38:56.447 --> 39:01.362
Sir, new coordinates are being fed
to the transporter by the exocomps.

39:01.447 --> 39:04.405
The coordinates
are inside the station core.

39:05.687 --> 39:07.962
- Kelso, energize.
- Aye, sir.

39:17.087 --> 39:19.078
Mr. La Forge.

39:22.647 --> 39:24.558
What are they up to?

39:28.047 --> 39:31.084
The exocomps are siphoning power
from the core.

39:31.167 --> 39:33.397
They're distorting the stream.

39:33.487 --> 39:35.955
That might open up a window
to beam us out.

39:36.047 --> 39:39.119
If they can modulate
the radiation field, it'll work.

39:39.207 --> 39:43.041
but they have to get the subharmonic
frequencies to resonance.

39:44.967 --> 39:49.040
The particle-stream frequency
is beginning to fluctuate.

39:49.687 --> 39:53.157
They're having difficulty
controlling the feedback.

39:53.247 --> 39:56.159
Can we help them?
Modulate the power transfer?

39:56.247 --> 40:00.001
No, sir, we've done all we can do.
It's up to them now.

40:01.527 --> 40:05.759
They're beginning to balance
the power-absorption rates.

40:05.847 --> 40:10.159
It's working. The particle stream
is beginning to distort.

40:11.087 --> 40:12.805
Almost at resonance.

40:15.807 --> 40:18.321
- They've got it.
- Drop the force field.

40:21.127 --> 40:24.403
- Commander, I've got a pattern lock.
- Energize.

40:32.407 --> 40:35.797
- Can you lock on to the exocomps?
- I'm trying, sir.

40:47.847 --> 40:51.237
I'm sorry, I was only able
to lock on to two of them.

40:51.327 --> 40:53.522
I couldn't fix a signal
on the other one.

40:53.607 --> 40:56.917
One of them had to continue
disrupting the particle stream.

40:57.007 --> 40:59.202
That could prevent a signal lock.

40:59.327 --> 41:02.160
It was the only way
to save the other two.

41:11.127 --> 41:14.836
I must admit you've given me a lot
to think about, Cmdr Data.

41:14.927 --> 41:17.521
I don't exactly know
what the exocomps are,

41:17.607 --> 41:21.520
but be assured, until I do, I won't
be treating them as simple tools.

41:22.047 --> 41:26.484
Thank you. I wish your particle
fountain had been more successful.

41:26.567 --> 41:29.286
Maybe the exocomps
will help you reconstruct it.

41:29.367 --> 41:33.121
I hope they will. And I predict
that in a year or two,

41:33.207 --> 41:36.677
you will be able to recommend
the technology to Starfleet.

41:37.207 --> 41:39.880
I look forward to it.

41:40.927 --> 41:41.962
Doctor.

41:46.207 --> 41:49.836
- Something more, Mr. Data?
- Yes, sir.

41:49.927 --> 41:51.485
You might want to know why

41:51.567 --> 41:55.162
I was willing to risk your life
for several small machines.

41:55.247 --> 41:59.320
I think I understand. It could not
have been an easy choice.

41:59.407 --> 42:00.806
No, sir, it was not.

42:00.887 --> 42:03.765
When my own status
as a living being was in question,

42:03.847 --> 42:07.806
you fought to protect my rights.
I will always be grateful.

42:07.887 --> 42:10.162
The exocomps had no such advocate.

42:10.247 --> 42:14.559
If I had not acted on their behalf,
they would have been destroyed.

42:14.647 --> 42:16.877
I could not allow that to happen.

42:17.407 --> 42:19.762
Of course you couldn't.

42:19.847 --> 42:23.635
It was the most human decision
you've ever made.
