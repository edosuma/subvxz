of your undivided attention,
please?

10:34.808 --> 10:36.592
- Sorry.
Sorry.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.290
I love cops.
You guys are solid citizens.

10:39.334 --> 10:42.076
Not like these hedge fund
pricks and airhead models

10:42.119 --> 10:43.947
that I have to deal
with in this place.

10:43.991 --> 10:45.601
I'm all about authenticity.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.472
It's why I started
Far Rockaway.

10:47.516 --> 10:50.780
And it all began with a glass
of Manischewitz and a plate

10:50.824 --> 10:53.000
of gefilte fish in my mother's
kitchen in Queens.

10:53.043 --> 10:54.784
- How 'bout this for
authenticity--

10:54.828 --> 10:57.134
We have reason to believe Kayla
was sexually assaulted

10:57.178 --> 10:58.614
here last night.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.312
- Yeah, and you were the last
person that she was with.

11:01.356 --> 11:02.879
- Wait a minute.

11:02.923 --> 11:04.707
Is she saying that I...

11:06.709 --> 11:08.929
Oh...

11:08.972 --> 11:10.495
That's what this is about?

11:11.671 --> 11:12.802
I mean,
what happened down here?

11:14.630 --> 11:17.154
She asked me to pop a bottle,
and I told her that I couldn't

11:17.198 --> 11:18.982
stop staring at her
ass all night.

11:19.026 --> 11:20.810
- Interesting way
to treat your employee.

11:20.854 --> 11:24.684
Consensual sex.

11:24.727 --> 11:25.772
- Yeah, well,
when we found her,

11:25.815 --> 11:27.338
it didn't look
consensual to us.

11:27.382 --> 11:30.124
Oh, she was begging for it.

11:30.167 --> 11:32.169
I banged her up against
a crate of Bordeaux.

11:32.213 --> 11:33.780
- Did you also rip
her shirt open?

11:33.823 --> 11:35.390
- I buy the damn shirts.

11:35.433 --> 11:39.176
Look, this was not the first
time that we screwed, even.

11:39.220 --> 11:41.352
If she's claiming
that I raped her,

11:41.396 --> 11:43.877
this is some kind
of shake down.

11:52.146 --> 11:52.363
.

11:52.407 --> 11:54.757
- It's our job.

11:54.801 --> 11:56.106
- Well, I could lose my job
over this, okay?

11:56.150 --> 11:57.760
I make six figures
at that restaurant.

11:57.804 --> 12:00.502
- But is Andrew Liebowitz
the one that assaulted you?

12:00.545 --> 12:01.982
- No, I--

12:02.678 --> 12:05.159
It's not like that.

12:07.335 --> 12:09.032
- Have a seat.

12:10.947 --> 12:12.166
Okay, look.

12:12.209 --> 12:14.255
It wasn't all rose petals
and fireworks,

12:14.298 --> 12:15.996
if that's what you're asking,
but I am handling it.

12:16.039 --> 12:17.301
- Andrew said that it wasn't

12:17.345 --> 12:19.260
the first time
that you two had...

12:20.348 --> 12:22.785
- Okay, once at the Christmas
party last year,

12:22.829 --> 12:24.439
but that was a mistake.

12:24.482 --> 12:26.571
- But the other night,
did he force you?

12:30.750 --> 12:33.274
- It's not a black
and white thing.

12:36.146 --> 12:37.582
When Andrew started
coming on to me,

12:37.626 --> 12:40.629
I tried playing it off.
I even said no at one point.

12:40.672 --> 12:42.326
But he didn't stop.

12:43.458 --> 12:45.460
- That sounds black
and white to me.

12:45.503 --> 12:48.898
- Oh, this is just how it is in
the restaurant industry, okay?

12:48.942 --> 12:50.204
You wouldn't understand.

12:50.247 --> 12:51.640
I should have just kneed
him in the balls.

12:51.683 --> 12:54.817
- Kayla, it sounds like
your boss raped you.

12:54.861 --> 12:57.907
- It is not rape
if I say it's not.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.084
Okay, look.

13:01.128 --> 13:03.826
I appreciate what you guys
are trying to do here, okay?

13:03.870 --> 13:07.612
I really do,
but just stay out of my life.

13:07.656 --> 13:10.137
Before you ruin it.

13:12.617 --> 13:14.141
- Well, Kayla told him no,

13:14.184 --> 13:15.838
but she refuses
to say it was rape.

13:15.882 --> 13:17.753
Did he admit to pressuring her?

13:17.797 --> 13:21.191
- He insists it was consensual
but no cameras, no witnesses.

13:21.235 --> 13:22.584
- Look, she's not gonna
testify against him.

13:22.627 --> 13:23.977
- Yeah, without
a complaining witness,

13:24.020 --> 13:25.369
I can't move forward.

13:25.413 --> 13:26.980
- Hold on.
Now, Liebowitz has no priors.

13:27.023 --> 13:29.025
But he does pop up
on three separate 61s.

13:29.069 --> 13:30.984
- No, Brooklyn SVU.

13:31.027 --> 13:32.681
These all happened
in the past four years.

13:32.724 --> 13:34.378
- Well, he's got a wine bar
in Park Slope.

13:34.422 --> 13:36.032
- Yeah, three separate
employees accused him

13:36.076 --> 13:37.860
of sexual assault.
- All right, talk to them.

13:37.904 --> 13:39.253
See if we can stir the pot.

13:43.387 --> 13:45.172
- Four years,
and now you wanna look into it?

13:45.215 --> 13:46.826
- Why don't you just
tell me what happened?

13:46.869 --> 13:49.350
- I'll tell you the same thing
I told the cops in Brooklyn.

13:49.393 --> 13:51.352
I sommed for Andrew
at his wine bar.

13:51.395 --> 13:54.137
And after hours I'd serve
him and his buddies.

13:54.181 --> 13:56.792
It was actually a good job.
Great tips.

13:56.836 --> 14:01.928
- I was a server for Andrew
before I got sober.

14:01.971 --> 14:06.193
Um, one night,
I'm barely able to stand,

14:06.236 --> 14:09.718
and he leans in
and plants one on me.

14:09.761 --> 14:11.938
And I kissed him back.

14:11.981 --> 14:13.635
But then, uh...

14:13.678 --> 14:16.203
- One night Andrew starts
to get a little touchy-feely

14:16.246 --> 14:17.987
and I tried to politely
turn him down.

14:18.031 --> 14:21.599
But, hey, he's my boss.

14:21.643 --> 14:26.648
- He said,
"You want that promotion?"

14:26.691 --> 14:30.043
And then he...

14:30.086 --> 14:35.570
got up and walked over
to the door.

14:35.613 --> 14:39.704
- We head down to his office,
and immediately he's trying

14:39.748 --> 14:41.271
to take all my clothes off.

14:41.315 --> 14:43.230
And so I try to pump
the brakes,

14:43.273 --> 14:46.363
but by then I'm so drunk.

14:46.407 --> 14:49.584
He's tossing me around
like a rag doll.

14:49.627 --> 14:51.978
- He pulled up my skirt.

14:56.547 --> 14:58.767
I, um...

14:58.810 --> 15:00.551
I tried to fight him off.

15:00.595 --> 15:04.251
- He held me down so hard,
he sprained my wrist.

15:04.294 --> 15:06.993
- I blacked out at some point.

15:07.036 --> 15:09.604
Woke up naked on his couch.

15:09.647 --> 15:14.000
- I tried to get out of there
as quickly as I could.

15:15.479 --> 15:20.789
Andrew put his foot
on my underwear.

15:20.832 --> 15:23.009
And he said,

15:23.052 --> 15:25.185
"These...

15:25.228 --> 15:27.361
These are for me."

15:27.404 --> 15:29.624
- And as I'm getting
dressed to leave,

15:29.667 --> 15:34.107
I realize that
I'm missing something.

15:34.150 --> 15:37.675
That son of a bitch
pocketed my panties.

15:39.155 --> 15:40.896
- Did Andrew ever
take anything from you?

15:42.593 --> 15:44.987
- Yeah, like
an article of clothing.

15:45.031 --> 15:49.035
- Oh. My thong.

15:49.078 --> 15:50.993
How did you know that?

15:51.037 --> 15:53.300
- Because unfortunately,
Lauren,

15:53.343 --> 15:55.563
you weren't alone.

15:57.043 --> 15:58.479
- That's even worse.

15:58.522 --> 16:00.524
I'm stuck working in this
dive bar because Andrew

16:00.568 --> 16:04.441
blacklisted me, and he's
walking around a free man?

16:04.485 --> 16:05.921
- All three women reported,

16:05.965 --> 16:07.575
but not a single
arrest was made.

16:07.618 --> 16:09.881
Witnesses

16:09.925 --> 16:12.145
- If Liebowitz would have
done this in Manhattan,

16:12.188 --> 16:13.929
we'd have his ass
in a 6x8 cell.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.671
- Now, the only constant was
this ADA named Chris Hodges.

16:16.714 --> 16:18.455
He caught all three cases,
but he declined

16:18.499 --> 16:20.501
to prosecute each time.

16:20.544 --> 16:22.111
- Boy wonder prosecutor
in Brooklyn.

16:22.155 --> 16:23.591
Big in the Me Too movement.

16:23.634 --> 16:25.767
- Yeah, he runs some kind
of victims advocacy group.

16:25.810 --> 16:29.727
- Rumor is he's gunning to run
for Kings County D.A.

16:32.992 --> 16:35.037
- Mr. Kelly was acquitted
on all of the rape counts.

16:35.081 --> 16:37.126
- But he was convicted of three
counts of sexual conduct

16:37.170 --> 16:38.780
against a child.

16:38.823 --> 16:41.348
- My client teaches in the
public schools for 20 years.

16:41.391 --> 16:43.045
He attends church and
volunteers at a soup kitchen

16:43.089 --> 16:44.699
which serves--
- I don't care if he

16:44.742 --> 16:46.179
hand delivers Thanksgiving
turkeys and cranberry sauce

16:46.222 --> 16:48.529
to every family in Brooklyn.

16:48.572 --> 16:50.618
He molested
three underage girls.

16:50.661 --> 16:53.186
That we know of.
You must send a message here.

16:53.229 --> 16:54.883
- I agree with Mr. Hodges.

16:54.926 --> 16:57.364
I hereby sentence him to the
maximum the law will allow.

16:57.407 --> 17:00.715
Three consecutive sentences
of seven years.

17:00.758 --> 17:01.890
Remand the defendant.

17:10.072 --> 17:11.378
- Excuse me.

17:11.421 --> 17:13.597
I'm Peter Stone.
I'm with the Manhattan D.A.

17:13.641 --> 17:15.208
- Right.

17:15.251 --> 17:17.906
- I saw your father speak
at a few CLE programs.

17:17.949 --> 17:20.952
- Yeah, he, uh--he loved
a captive audience.

17:20.996 --> 17:22.563
- He did.

17:22.606 --> 17:26.697
- My office is investigating
a chef named Andrew Liebowitz.

17:27.916 --> 17:29.352
- Same thing he did here,
apparently.

17:29.396 --> 17:30.962
Why did you decline
to prosecute?

17:31.006 --> 17:32.573
- Liebowitz is a real
piece of work.

17:32.616 --> 17:34.227
I wish we could have
gone after him,

17:34.270 --> 17:35.967
but all three of my
complainants had issues.

17:36.011 --> 17:37.752
- My cops thought they
seemed pretty credible.

17:37.795 --> 17:40.015
- You know, late disclosures,
no rape kits,

17:40.059 --> 17:44.367
drug and alcohol problems,
uh, prior sexual relationships.

17:44.411 --> 17:45.542
We can't waste time and money

17:45.586 --> 17:47.153
on cases we'll never win,
right?

17:47.196 --> 17:48.154
- Still, Liebowitz
seems like he pushes

17:48.197 --> 17:49.590
the meaning of consent.

17:49.633 --> 17:52.375
- Well, look, I hope you
fare better than I did.

17:52.419 --> 17:53.681
Let me know what
I can do to help.

17:53.724 --> 17:55.291
- Yeah, thanks.
- All right.

18:00.166 --> 18:03.865
- I cannot believe that Hodges
of all people didn't move

18:03.908 --> 18:06.433
forward with these charges.
Read this.

18:06.476 --> 18:08.217
- He's convinced all three
cases are losers.

18:08.261 --> 18:10.001
- There are no
perfect witnesses.

18:10.045 --> 18:11.960
That goes with the territory.

18:12.003 --> 18:14.745
- Fin and Carisi tell me he's
strong on women's issues.

18:14.789 --> 18:17.357
- Well, he made a name
for himself busting a Russian

18:17.400 --> 18:19.402
sex trafficking ring.
They even tried to kill him.

18:19.446 --> 18:23.102
But a garden variety
prosecution of Liebowitz?

18:23.145 --> 18:25.669
This is a no-brainer.
- Until you get an acquittal.

18:25.713 --> 18:27.889
And that's all people remember.

18:33.895 --> 18:35.157
To have any chance at trial,

18:35.201 --> 18:37.464
I have to convince
Kayla to testify.

18:37.507 --> 18:40.902
- No arm twisting, Peter.
- Oh, don't worry.

18:40.945 --> 18:44.123
I've been watching someone
who's pretty damn good at this.

18:44.166 --> 18:45.907
Hmm.

18:50.999 --> 18:53.262
I'm Peter Stone.
I work with Lieutenant Benson.

18:53.306 --> 18:55.743
- Oh, what is it
with you people?

18:55.786 --> 18:58.049
- We found three
additional victims, Kayla.

18:58.093 --> 19:00.487
They all worked at Liebowitz's
wine bar in Brooklyn.

19:00.530 --> 19:02.663
- Great. So have them be
your poster girls.

19:02.706 --> 19:04.360
- I can't prosecute
those cases.

19:04.404 --> 19:05.579
They'll testify to support you,

19:05.622 --> 19:07.320
but I need you
to open the door.

19:07.363 --> 19:09.583
- And I need to keep my job.

19:10.671 --> 19:12.673
- You need to take
care of yourself.

19:12.716 --> 19:14.109
Do you really think
he won't do this again?

19:14.153 --> 19:15.632
- I can handle it now.

19:15.676 --> 19:17.330
- Well, maybe you won't have
to since he already has your

19:17.373 --> 19:20.333
panties in his trophy case.

19:22.509 --> 19:24.511
- How did you--
- It's about power, Kayla.

19:24.554 --> 19:26.513
He's gonna keep raping
the women who work for him

19:26.556 --> 19:28.906
until somebody stands up
and stops him.

19:31.387 --> 19:32.780
- I don't think that I--

19:32.823 --> 19:36.566
- I can't imagine how
difficult this is, Kayla.

19:37.741 --> 19:41.919
My sister was murdered by
the people I was prosecuting.

19:44.922 --> 19:47.229
I have to wake up every morning
and convince myself

19:47.273 --> 19:48.970
that it wasn't my fault.

19:49.013 --> 19:53.148
And the only way I can do that
is if I believe I can stop it

19:53.192 --> 19:55.759
from happening
to somebody else.

19:58.936 --> 20:02.592
- I used to love my job
at Far Rockaway.

20:02.636 --> 20:05.378
My coworkers are my friends.

20:05.421 --> 20:07.336
And I'm finally
making decent money.

20:07.380 --> 20:09.382
- Andrew took all
that away from you.

20:09.425 --> 20:12.254
Nobody should have
to pay that price.

20:12.298 --> 20:13.560
- I'm supposed
to get paid tomorrow.

20:13.603 --> 20:14.909
- You don't have to go in.

20:14.952 --> 20:17.520
We can arrest him tonight,
if you're on board.

20:18.391 --> 20:20.436
- These other women,
they're not gonna back out?

20:20.480 --> 20:23.265
- No. I promise.

20:26.268 --> 20:28.270
♪

20:28.314 --> 20:30.011
- Okay.

20:31.839 --> 20:33.536
Do me a favor.

20:33.580 --> 20:37.497
Send the cops tomorrow
during my shift.

20:37.540 --> 20:39.499
I wanna see this go down.

20:41.675 --> 20:43.067
- Okay.

20:59.823 --> 21:02.348
- That looks delicious.

21:02.391 --> 21:04.393
- I'm arresting you
for the rape of Kayla Morgan.

21:16.666 --> 21:19.365
- You ungrateful bitch.
You're fired.

21:19.408 --> 21:21.105
- Where have I heard
that before?

21:28.417 --> 21:28.809
.

21:28.852 --> 21:31.377
- Indictment number 4363,
People vs. Andrew Liebowitz.

21:31.420 --> 21:32.726
Rape in the first degree.

21:32.769 --> 21:34.205
- How do you plead,
Mr. Liebowitz?

21:34.249 --> 21:35.468
- Not guilty.

21:35.511 --> 21:37.208
- Absolutely.

21:37.252 --> 21:39.689
The charge is forcible rape.
We're asking for $2 million.

21:39.733 --> 21:40.951
- That's punitive.

21:40.995 --> 21:42.823
This is a classic he said,
she said.

21:42.866 --> 21:44.215
- The People intend
to introduce evidence

21:44.259 --> 21:46.261
that the defendant
is a serial predator.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.481
There are three prior rape
allegations in Brooklyn.

21:48.524 --> 21:50.047
- Those charges
were never filed.

21:50.091 --> 21:52.354
- The People intend
to introduce them to establish

21:52.398 --> 21:53.834
his modus operandi.

21:53.877 --> 21:56.227
- Ah, Bill Cosby
all over again.

21:56.271 --> 21:58.969
We'll hold a Molineux hearing
in my chambers to determine

21:59.013 --> 22:00.754
the admissibility
of this testimony.

22:00.797 --> 22:04.018
Bail is set at $1 million,
cash or bond.

22:05.280 --> 22:07.369
- Three employees in the
defendant's Brooklyn wine bar

22:07.413 --> 22:09.545
came forward with sexual
assault complaints against him.

22:09.589 --> 22:11.068
Their accounts
are nearly identical.

22:12.461 --> 22:14.028
- These women were plied
with alcohol or marijuana

22:14.071 --> 22:16.117
after closing time as
a prelude to these assaults.

22:16.160 --> 22:19.338
- A little wine or weed before
sex is hardly a one-of-a-kind

22:19.381 --> 22:20.556
criminal signature.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.036
- After the attacks,
the defendant took

22:22.079 --> 22:23.429
an undergarment
from each of the victims.

22:23.472 --> 22:24.604
You know, as a memento.

22:24.647 --> 22:25.909
- You're getting warmer,
Mr. Stone,

22:25.953 --> 22:27.389
but you're still
missing the big picture.

22:27.433 --> 22:30.305
Modus operandi evidence
is admissible to prove

22:30.349 --> 22:33.264
the identity of a suspect.
This isn't a whodunit.

22:33.308 --> 22:34.831
It's a what happened.

22:34.875 --> 22:37.181
- The fact that he did the same
thing on three--now four--

22:37.225 --> 22:39.488
separate occasions demonstrates
a common scheme or plan

22:39.532 --> 22:40.924
on the part of the defendant.

22:40.968 --> 22:42.752
- No. It's an attempt
to demonstrate my client's

22:42.796 --> 22:44.885
propensity to behave badly.

22:44.928 --> 22:47.409
The ulterior motive behind
Mr. Stone's ploy is to have

22:47.453 --> 22:50.194
the jury convict Mr. Liebowitz,
not for the allegations

22:50.238 --> 22:52.936
in this complaint
but for his prior acts.

22:52.980 --> 22:55.983
- Why weren't these three cases
prosecuted in Brooklyn?

22:56.026 --> 22:58.420
- You'll have to ask
the Brooklyn D.A.

22:58.464 --> 23:00.291
- Mr. Stone.

23:02.163 --> 23:03.686
- There were apparently
questions about

23:03.730 --> 23:05.209
the complainants' credibility.

23:05.253 --> 23:07.429
- And why would I allow
them to testify here?

23:07.473 --> 23:09.518
- It's up to a jury to decide
whether to believe them.

23:09.562 --> 23:13.914
- Yes, but first it is up to me
to decide if the prejudicial

23:13.957 --> 23:18.397
effect of this testimony
outweighs its probative value.

23:18.440 --> 23:22.139
I rule it does.

23:23.967 --> 23:26.361
- At least let me call one
of the Brooklyn women.

23:26.405 --> 23:30.409
- All three witnesses
are excluded.

23:34.369 --> 23:35.675
- Your Honor.

23:35.718 --> 23:37.981
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

23:38.025 --> 23:39.983
There's no way Kayla's
going to go this alone now.

23:42.246 --> 23:43.813
- The Appellate Division
justices would laugh

23:43.857 --> 23:45.859
in my face.

23:45.902 --> 23:48.122
- So we're dead in the water.

23:48.165 --> 23:50.080
- I'm afraid so.

23:50.124 --> 23:52.474
- Look, I understand why Kayla
won't go toe-to-toe

23:52.518 --> 23:55.129
with the man who raped her,
but Chris Hodges?

23:55.172 --> 23:58.611
Chris Hodges is the go-to
prosecutor for Brooklyn SVU.

23:58.654 --> 24:00.264
- Look, there were
some problems

24:00.308 --> 24:02.745
with those disclosures.

24:02.789 --> 24:04.312
There's gotta be more to it.

24:04.355 --> 24:06.009
- Some prosecutors
talk a good game.

24:06.053 --> 24:07.576
But the bottom line
is whether they win or lose.

24:07.620 --> 24:10.927
- But not Chris Hodges.
That's not his reputation.

24:10.971 --> 24:14.670
Peter, maybe--maybe you need
to dig a little deeper.

24:14.714 --> 24:16.150
- Olivia, I--
- I'm telling you.

24:16.193 --> 24:18.369
Something's not right here.

24:24.550 --> 24:28.031
- We approach the bench,
and he's live streaming

24:28.075 --> 24:30.817
the fifth at Saratoga
on his iPad.

24:30.860 --> 24:32.209
I mean, that's why
they call me--

24:32.253 --> 24:33.733
- Sorry to interrupt.
- Stone.

24:33.776 --> 24:36.039
- Hey.

24:36.083 --> 24:37.998
- Beer's fine.
- There's a great IPA on tap.

24:38.041 --> 24:40.174
- Yeah, sure.

24:40.217 --> 24:43.438
- Andrew Liebowitz.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.309
- You kicked all three cases
in the complaint room.

24:45.353 --> 24:46.789
- Mmm.

24:46.833 --> 24:49.400
Well, I told you.
They were all buyer's remorse.

24:49.444 --> 24:51.011
- Maybe you let a Grand Jury
make that call.

24:51.054 --> 24:52.665
- Well, maybe I should
look at some of the cases

24:52.708 --> 24:55.798
you declined to prosecute.

24:57.670 --> 25:00.673
If I wasn't such a big fan,
maybe I'd tell you to get

25:00.716 --> 25:02.239
the hell out of my happy hour.

25:02.283 --> 25:05.329
You had one of the best
pick-off moves I ever saw.

25:05.373 --> 25:08.071
Three variations
in your look to first.

25:08.115 --> 25:10.334
Four different home counts.

25:10.378 --> 25:14.295
That dummy move when you
came set at the letters--

25:14.338 --> 25:15.426
forget about it.

25:15.470 --> 25:17.211
- You're more than
the casual observer.

25:17.254 --> 25:18.821
- Ah, Chris pitched
in high school.

25:18.865 --> 25:21.781
- Three years on varsity.

25:21.824 --> 25:25.567
- Uh, close me out, Davey,
while I hit the head.

25:27.482 --> 25:29.919
It's about as intimidating
as the Mud Hens.

25:29.963 --> 25:32.487
- Far Rockaway High.
In Queens.

25:35.577 --> 25:38.014
Chris grew up out there.

25:41.061 --> 25:47.371
♪

25:47.415 --> 25:49.373
- Liebowitz and Hodges went
to high school together.

25:49.417 --> 25:51.506
- That's why Hodges 86ed
the prosecutions?

25:51.550 --> 25:53.334
- They lived around the corner
from each other.

25:53.377 --> 25:54.814
Hodges' mom said they used
to drive to school together

25:54.857 --> 25:56.729
every day.
- I'm bumping on this.

25:56.772 --> 25:58.731
Hodges is all
about victims' rights.

25:58.774 --> 26:00.341
- Don't believe the hype,
Amanda.

26:00.384 --> 26:02.038
- He even spoke at
the Women's Day March.

26:02.082 --> 26:03.562
- That just makes
him a hypocrite.

26:03.605 --> 26:07.000
- So he'd risk his entire
political career to help out

26:07.043 --> 26:08.915
this high school buddy of his?

26:08.958 --> 26:10.481
- Maybe there's
something more to this.

26:10.525 --> 26:12.353
- Did Hodges' name pop
on any of Liebowitz's

26:12.396 --> 26:15.182
social media accounts?
- No, nothing.

26:15.225 --> 26:16.531
- Where are you
going with this?

26:16.575 --> 26:18.228
- This doesn't get
us over the hump,

26:18.272 --> 26:20.883
but we know Liebowitz
is a habitual offender.

26:20.927 --> 26:23.494
- So there must be other women
that he victimized

26:23.538 --> 26:25.235
besides the three in Brooklyn.
- He opened his

26:25.279 --> 26:27.586
Manhattan restaurant in 2013.
Kayla can't be

26:27.629 --> 26:29.413
the first woman he assaulted
in that wine cellar.

26:29.457 --> 26:32.068
- There's not a single
complaint in our database.

26:32.112 --> 26:35.681
- Maybe they're getting
paid not to disclose.

26:37.421 --> 26:38.640
We should run full court press
on Liebowitz's financials.

26:38.684 --> 26:40.163
- Right, social and corporate.

26:40.207 --> 26:43.384
Anything over three digits
that isn't his mortgage.

26:44.254 --> 26:46.474
- I thought the restaurant
business was tough.

26:46.517 --> 26:48.737
This guy's clearing over
2, 3 million a year.

26:48.781 --> 26:50.609
- That's like cardiology money.

26:53.089 --> 26:54.656
Just doesn't seem
like your type,

26:54.700 --> 26:56.266
that's all I'm saying.

26:56.310 --> 26:59.008
Broke?
- A little edge.

26:59.052 --> 27:00.531
- Edge can be overrated.

27:00.575 --> 27:02.533
- Liebowitz's backers
put up all the cash

27:02.577 --> 27:04.100
for both his places.

27:04.144 --> 27:06.668
- He did make a contribution
to Hodges' boss when she ran

27:06.712 --> 27:08.017
for D.A. in Brooklyn.

27:08.061 --> 27:10.541
- Rich gaming the system.
Same as it ever was.

27:10.585 --> 27:12.500
- Yeah, maybe so,
but if he ever paid a woman off

27:12.543 --> 27:14.676
to keep quiet,
it is not in here.

27:16.243 --> 27:18.375
- We tell Liv and Stone
his numbers are clean.

27:18.419 --> 27:20.856
And then we all go
try and get six hours.

27:20.900 --> 27:22.292
- Mm-hmm.

27:23.990 --> 27:25.948
- So this is everything
we talked about.

27:25.992 --> 27:28.255
When will it hit?
- Tomorrow morning.

27:35.566 --> 27:37.133
- Hey, Amanda,
would you like half

27:37.177 --> 27:40.049
of my cinnamon raisin bagel?
- No, thanks.

27:41.747 --> 27:42.922
- Amanda, listen.

27:42.965 --> 27:46.186
I, uh--What I said
last night about Al,

27:46.229 --> 27:48.188
I didn't really mean it.
- It's--it's no problem.

27:48.231 --> 27:50.407
- I mean, I was just
busting your chops.

27:50.451 --> 27:51.974
I'm really happy
you found somebody.

27:52.018 --> 27:53.236
- Fin, we're cool.
Really.

27:53.280 --> 27:54.542
- Okay.
- Hi.

27:54.585 --> 27:57.284
You guys see this?

27:58.764 --> 28:00.287
- Somebody leaked
our investigation.

28:00.330 --> 28:02.681
- No, my money's on Liv.

28:02.724 --> 28:04.247
- Mine's on both.

28:04.291 --> 28:05.858
- "Before his
arrest in Manhattan,

28:05.901 --> 28:09.296
"sources say Andrew Liebowitz
committed three uncharged

28:09.339 --> 28:11.602
sexual assaults
in his Brooklyn wine bar."

28:13.996 --> 28:15.389
- Okay, if there's
more victims,

28:15.432 --> 28:16.912
then this is gonna
open the floodgates.

28:20.089 --> 28:21.874
- I saw this this morning.

28:21.917 --> 28:24.746
I want to report a sex crime.

28:24.790 --> 28:26.139
He tried to rape me.

28:26.182 --> 28:28.750
It was a long time ago,
but...

28:31.013 --> 28:33.755
- No. Chris Hodges.

28:33.799 --> 28:36.018
The lawyer.

28:39.195 --> 28:41.328
♪

28:45.506 --> 28:45.724
.

28:45.767 --> 28:48.204
- I was 15.

28:48.248 --> 28:51.860
This girl was having a party
because her parents were away.

28:53.470 --> 28:56.691
She invited some kids
she knew from Far Rockaway.

28:56.735 --> 29:01.261
- So...what happened
at this party?

29:01.304 --> 29:04.438
- There were 10 or 12 of us.

29:04.481 --> 29:07.354
One of the boys
brought tequila.

29:08.659 --> 29:13.490
I remember winding up in one
of the bedrooms with Chris

29:13.534 --> 29:14.927
and one of his friends.

29:16.189 --> 29:17.756
The other man on
the front page?

29:17.799 --> 29:20.846
- Could be.
I don't remember his name.

29:20.889 --> 29:22.151
I can't say for sure.

29:22.195 --> 29:24.675
- Okay.

29:24.719 --> 29:30.507
- Chris pushed me to the floor
and got on top of me.

29:32.945 --> 29:36.513
- Bethany, I know how hard
this is to relive, so...

29:41.388 --> 29:44.565
Just--Just take your time,
okay?

29:49.135 --> 29:52.399
- He pinned me down.

29:52.442 --> 29:56.969
Put his hand down my shorts.

29:57.012 --> 30:00.233
And the other boy,
he was saying things to him.

30:01.974 --> 30:03.845
- Like a cheerleader.

30:03.889 --> 30:06.848
"Go for it, dude."
Things like that.

30:06.892 --> 30:12.158
And I was screaming,
"No, no, get off me."

30:12.201 --> 30:14.856
But he covered my mouth.

30:21.732 --> 30:25.388
Chris pulled down my shorts
with his other hand.

30:27.303 --> 30:31.264
The other boy came over I think
maybe to give him a condom.

30:31.307 --> 30:36.356
And that's when I pushed him
off me and ran out of the room.

30:37.052 --> 30:40.186
- And this was the first time
that you had met Chris?

30:40.229 --> 30:41.796
- No, I met him before.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.972
I definitely knew his name.

30:44.016 --> 30:48.890
And when I read the article
today and saw his picture...

30:48.934 --> 30:51.023
- Okay.

30:51.066 --> 30:54.678
And after this happened
to you, Bethany,

30:54.722 --> 30:56.985
did you tell anyone?

30:57.029 --> 31:00.032
- When I got home,
I couldn't think straight.

31:00.075 --> 31:01.860
My dad was strict.

31:01.903 --> 31:05.472
If he knew I was drinking
with older boys...

31:05.515 --> 31:07.474
My therapist knows.

31:07.517 --> 31:08.605
- Okay.

31:08.649 --> 31:11.217
- I've been seeing
her for years.

31:11.260 --> 31:13.349
She said I should
tell my husband,

31:13.393 --> 31:15.395
so I finally did last year.

31:15.438 --> 31:22.010
- And after all this happened,
did you confide in anyone?

31:22.054 --> 31:23.925
- No.

31:23.969 --> 31:26.754
But my friend Emily
was at the party.

31:28.234 --> 31:32.412
When I got out of that bedroom,
I made her leave with me.

31:32.455 --> 31:35.545
She could see
I was really upset.

31:37.025 --> 31:38.897
- Okay.

31:42.204 --> 31:44.772
Wow, I haven't seen her
since high school.

31:44.815 --> 31:46.121
- Yeah, she said you two
were friends back then.

31:46.165 --> 31:48.167
- Yeah, we worked
at the same summer camp.

31:48.210 --> 31:50.647
But after high school,
we lost touch.

31:50.691 --> 31:52.519
- Do you remember any
parties you guys went to

31:52.562 --> 31:54.086
back when you were sophomores?

31:54.129 --> 31:57.785
- We went to different schools,
but, um...

31:57.828 --> 32:00.962
Oh.
It was that party.

32:01.006 --> 32:04.226
- Tell us about it.
- It was downtown, I think.

32:04.270 --> 32:09.101
There was about 30 or 40 kids.
A few of us from Far Rockaway.

32:09.144 --> 32:13.061
There was a keg and at one
point Bethany came out

32:13.105 --> 32:15.934
of the bedrooms and said
we had to leave right away.

32:19.633 --> 32:21.330
- It's important that you tell
us what you remember.

32:21.374 --> 32:23.811
- Look, I don't know exactly
what happened in there.

32:23.854 --> 32:25.900
- Well, what did Bethany
say happened?

32:27.206 --> 32:30.078
- That she was in one of
the bedrooms with two boys

32:30.122 --> 32:31.862
from my school.

32:33.299 --> 32:37.999
I'm pretty sure it was Chris
Hodges and Andrew Liebowitz.

32:38.043 --> 32:40.001
She didn't tell me
what they did to her,

32:40.045 --> 32:43.570
but she was shaking and I knew
something terrible had happened

32:43.613 --> 32:45.050
but she wouldn't tell me.

32:45.093 --> 32:47.661
She just wanted me
to help her find a taxi.

32:47.704 --> 32:50.794
- Did you tell anybody
after you left?

32:50.838 --> 32:53.841
- Bethany begged me
not to say anything.

32:53.884 --> 32:55.974
Anyway, I was 15
and she was my friend.

32:56.017 --> 32:58.759
I didn't wanna go
against her wishes.

33:01.196 --> 33:02.632
- I'm done with your
Andrew Liebowitz problem.

33:02.676 --> 33:04.112
- Yeah, well,
that's not what this is about.

33:04.156 --> 33:05.592
- Well, then you'd better
have a damn good reason

33:05.635 --> 33:07.159
for insisting
I come up here.

33:07.202 --> 33:08.987
- You better consider yourself
lucky we didn't perp walk you

33:09.030 --> 33:10.684
out of your own office.

33:10.727 --> 33:12.164
What the hell
are you talking about?

33:12.207 --> 33:14.557
- The girl that you tried
to rape in high school.

33:14.601 --> 33:17.647
Excuse me?

33:17.691 --> 33:19.171
- Bethany Fisher.

33:19.214 --> 33:20.781
She was friends
with Emily Holmes.

33:20.824 --> 33:22.522
That's a girl you went
to high school with.

33:22.565 --> 33:23.827
- Yeah, I remember Emily.

33:23.871 --> 33:28.049
This Bethany person,
I have no i...dea--

33:33.794 --> 33:36.057
- Is this about a house party
like 15 years ago?

33:37.189 --> 33:38.538
It's all coming back
to you now, right?

33:38.581 --> 33:40.192
- No, but I know
one thing for sure.

33:40.235 --> 33:42.237
I didn't touch that girl.

33:44.022 --> 33:45.719
That was Andrew.
- Ah, that was fast.

33:45.762 --> 33:47.068
- But you were there.

33:47.112 --> 33:49.070
You were in that bedroom,
weren't you?

33:50.811 --> 33:54.075
- We were listening to music.
- Mm-hmm.

33:54.119 --> 33:55.555
- And Andrew jumped on top
of her and tried

33:55.598 --> 33:56.904
to take her clothes off.

33:56.947 --> 33:58.384
- And you just stood
there and did nothing?

33:58.427 --> 34:01.735
I pushed him off her.

34:01.778 --> 34:03.650
If it wasn't for me--
- "If it wasn't for me"--

34:03.693 --> 34:05.739
Would you spare us
the self righteous crap?

34:05.782 --> 34:07.958
We got two witnesses
that say it was you.

34:08.002 --> 34:09.264
- Well, they've
got it mixed up.

34:09.308 --> 34:10.570
I've never done
anything like that ever.

34:12.224 --> 34:13.703
So best-case scenario,
you just kept your damn mouth

34:13.747 --> 34:15.314
shut and you covered
your friend's ass?

34:17.707 --> 34:20.493
Did you ever go to high school?
That's the code.

34:20.536 --> 34:23.496
You have your friend's back.
That's the way the world works.

34:23.539 --> 34:25.237
- Not anymore.

34:25.280 --> 34:27.239
I'm part of the reason
things are different now.

34:27.282 --> 34:31.243
- Or Bethany is telling
the truth and you're not only

34:31.286 --> 34:35.421
the world's biggest hypocrite,
but you're also a rapist.

34:35.464 --> 34:37.858
- That's laughable.

34:37.901 --> 34:39.773
Andrew's been making
moves like this since he

34:39.816 --> 34:41.340
was old enough to shave.

34:41.383 --> 34:43.124
- Well.

34:48.521 --> 34:50.958
- That remains to be seen.

34:51.001 --> 34:52.960
But if you are
telling the truth,

34:53.003 --> 34:55.615
then you had a chance to
stand up for Bethany

34:55.658 --> 34:57.138
when you were
17 years old.

34:57.182 --> 35:01.273
So one way or the other,
you're gonna make this right.

35:02.578 --> 35:04.276
- Whatever you want.

35:04.319 --> 35:06.843
- Good.

35:06.887 --> 35:09.237
- Because I'm not gonna
let some girl

I never laid a hand on
destroy my reputation.

35:40.616 --> 35:42.749
She taught me a few things.

35:42.792 --> 35:45.055
- Which I know you

Thank you.

I'm innocent.

36:13.040 --> 36:15.085
- Seriously, did she
put up a fight?

36:15.129 --> 36:17.131
- Just a little.
Just a teaspoon.

36:17.175 --> 36:19.612
Enough to spice things up.

36:24.486 --> 36:26.227
- One confession down.

36:26.271 --> 36:28.011
- Yeah, now we just
need one for Bethany.

36:28.055 --> 36:31.580

Andrew, these days.

putting them out.

that's why I wanted to talk.

36:37.804 --> 36:39.588
I can't protect you anymore.

36:39.632 --> 36:40.937
- This time you didn't have to.

- Stone came to see me,
you idiot,

36:42.809 --> 36:45.942
about the three Brooklyn cases.
I saved your ass.

36:45.986 --> 36:47.466
Again.
- Thanks, man.

I've got a PAC now.

I'm making a run for office.
- Okay.

Bethany something.

wouldn't let you screw her?

The girl you practically raped.

- That was you, man.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

37:14.884 --> 37:16.277
At the fancy townhouse.

37:16.321 --> 37:17.800
- Yeah, we got her drunk
on tequila shots,

37:17.844 --> 37:19.628
and you tried
to rip her pants off.

37:19.672 --> 37:21.674

other girl we did

some kind of saint back then.

I was Mother Teresa.

37:45.915 --> 37:47.830

was think about getting buzzed

37:47.874 --> 37:49.658
