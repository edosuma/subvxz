01:16.000 --> 01:17.900
<i>Hot enough for you,
folks?</i>

01:17.934 --> 01:19.767
<i>It must be 1000 degrees
out there.</i>

01:19.801 --> 01:21.767
<i>Yep, it's
summertime,</i>

01:21.801 --> 01:23.700
<i>and the winos
are sizzling.</i>

01:23.734 --> 01:25.767
<i>Fish are popping,
and the DJ is high.</i>

01:25.801 --> 01:28.633
<i>I hope you're all
as cool as I am.</i>

01:37.367 --> 01:40.800
I wonder what the poor people
are doing today.

01:42.467 --> 01:44.733
Dad, why don't you just
buy us an air conditioner?

01:44.767 --> 01:46.333
Ah, you don't want
to be stuck inside

01:46.367 --> 01:47.700
on a day like today.

01:47.734 --> 01:49.767
Come on, dive in.

01:51.801 --> 01:54.099
Be careful. It hasn't been
an hour since you've eaten.

01:54.133 --> 01:56.099
Hey, don't
worry, Dad.

01:56.133 --> 01:57.400
Sometimes you just
gotta say

01:57.434 --> 01:58.600
what the hey
and go for it.

01:58.634 --> 02:00.167
Heh-heh-heh-heh.

02:03.968 --> 02:06.033
Daddy, I am sweating
cats and dogs.

02:06.067 --> 02:07.700
This pool sucks.

02:08.567 --> 02:09.699
If you two are bored,

02:09.734 --> 02:11.834
let's have a little
Jacuzzi action.

02:22.300 --> 02:23.600
Hey, Peg...

02:23.634 --> 02:26.366
<i>a little Tang margarita,
s'il vous pla√Æt.</i>

02:26.400 --> 02:28.834
Coming right up.

02:37.801 --> 02:39.401
You forgot the Tang.

02:40.334 --> 02:41.867
Look, Al.

02:41.901 --> 02:43.066
As much as
I applaud you

02:43.100 --> 02:44.667
exposing yourself
to water,

02:44.701 --> 02:47.133
don't you think it's time
we marched bravely into the '50s

02:47.167 --> 02:48.600
and bought
an air conditioner?

02:48.634 --> 02:50.667
Peg, can't
a hundred-degree day go by

02:50.701 --> 02:53.033
without you bringing up
air conditioning?

02:53.067 --> 02:54.467
Besides, as soon
as we get one,

02:54.501 --> 02:56.366
they're just gonna
invent something new.

02:56.400 --> 02:58.233
I'll be damned if I'll
have one in my house.

02:58.267 --> 03:02.468
That's the same thing
you said about the toothbrush.

03:03.467 --> 03:06.200
Look, Dad, I know
I'm no Psychology major,

03:06.234 --> 03:07.966
but, uh, could
the underlying reason

03:08.000 --> 03:09.300
for your reluctance
to buy us

03:09.334 --> 03:10.767
an air conditioner be
that, uh,

03:10.801 --> 03:13.099
you're the cheapest
man on the planet?

03:13.133 --> 03:15.066
Bud, if I was cheap,

03:15.100 --> 03:17.201
would we have all this?

03:18.067 --> 03:19.667
Now, I'll hear no more
about this.

03:19.701 --> 03:22.700
Kelly...let's play
Sea Monster.

03:23.200 --> 03:24.567
Aah!
A sea monster!

03:24.601 --> 03:27.700
Aah!

03:28.300 --> 03:30.334
Daddy.

03:32.968 --> 03:35.101
Mom, Dad scared me.

03:35.834 --> 03:37.633
He scares us all,
honey.

03:37.667 --> 03:39.233
Al.

03:39.267 --> 03:42.301
* Oh, the shark bites *

03:44.968 --> 03:46.733
* With his teeth big *

03:46.767 --> 03:50.467
* And he keeps them
Pearly white *

03:50.501 --> 03:52.066
Look, Al,
I am gonna

03:52.100 --> 03:54.200
ask you one more time,
rationally.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.333
Can we have
an air conditioner?

03:56.367 --> 03:57.400
Peg...

03:57.434 --> 04:00.266
as long as I have
my pool to frolic in,

04:00.300 --> 04:02.800
we don't need
an air conditioner.

04:02.834 --> 04:04.233
As I was saying...

04:04.267 --> 04:06.133
* Oh, this shark, unh *

04:06.167 --> 04:08.567
* With his teeth bites, unh *

04:08.601 --> 04:11.266
All right, kids.
It's time.

04:11.300 --> 04:12.966
* Oh, invite
All the sharks, unh *

04:13.000 --> 04:14.966
* To a party *

04:15.000 --> 04:16.399
* Then they'll know *

04:16.434 --> 04:19.433
* That Bundy's
Back in town, no *

04:19.466 --> 04:21.101
Hey!

04:24.767 --> 04:27.600
Oh! My pool.
My pool, Peg!

04:27.634 --> 04:28.900
Nice shooting,
Mom.

04:28.934 --> 04:31.734
Not really.
I was aiming at Daddy.

04:34.300 --> 04:37.034
Mom, can we throw
a couple more on?

04:39.467 --> 04:41.700
Well, this is
the last of them.

04:41.734 --> 04:42.733
Hey, wait a second.

04:42.767 --> 04:44.166
There were four cubes
in the tray

04:44.200 --> 04:45.500
the last time
that we checked.

04:45.534 --> 04:47.567
No, there
were three.

04:48.601 --> 04:49.867
She's
cube hogging.

04:49.901 --> 04:52.500
I'll hold her, you get
the tongs of life.

04:55.167 --> 04:56.800
Your daddy.

04:57.334 --> 04:59.066
It's our
air conditioner.

04:59.100 --> 05:00.233
Oh, God.

05:00.267 --> 05:02.667
At long last, we're
all gonna be cool.

05:02.701 --> 05:05.800
Even you, Bud,
for the very first time.

05:07.167 --> 05:08.333
Yeah, well,
it's a long time

05:08.367 --> 05:10.567
since you had
a first time for anything.

05:13.067 --> 05:14.467
But don't get
too cocky, Kel.

05:14.501 --> 05:16.266
Remember, Dad went himself.

05:16.300 --> 05:18.133
Oh, it's just
an air conditioner.

05:18.167 --> 05:20.567
A moron could get
an air conditioner.

05:20.601 --> 05:22.934
<i>I could get
an air conditioner.</i>

05:23.534 --> 05:24.834
Ugh. Kids.

05:24.868 --> 05:26.533
Come and
help me here.

05:29.434 --> 05:31.900
I-- I can't see.
I can't see.

05:31.934 --> 05:32.900
Have you got it?

05:32.934 --> 05:34.500
Yeah, Dad.

05:34.534 --> 05:35.834
All right.
Good.

05:35.868 --> 05:37.300
All right,
easy here.

05:37.334 --> 05:38.934
It's heavy.
Easy.

05:38.968 --> 05:40.333
Here we go.

05:40.367 --> 05:42.066
Oh. Oh!

05:42.100 --> 05:44.867
Oh.
Kids. you okay?

05:48.234 --> 05:49.967
Fine.

05:51.734 --> 05:54.033
Yes, family.
Look at it.

05:54.067 --> 05:56.533
It's a Kaiser.

05:57.267 --> 06:00.400
The pride of World War II
Germany.

06:00.434 --> 06:01.400
Look at it,
kids.

06:01.434 --> 06:03.733
Doesn't it
just say cool?

06:03.767 --> 06:06.934
Actually, it says,
"Property of Erwin Rommel."

06:07.501 --> 06:08.834
You know, Al,
I thought you were

06:08.868 --> 06:10.099
going to
a discount store

06:10.133 --> 06:11.767
to get one of
those Korean ones.

06:11.801 --> 06:14.333
You know, with names almost
like real products.

06:14.367 --> 06:16.999
Like our "Frigidoor"
refrigerator...

06:17.033 --> 06:19.767
"RC-hey" TV.

06:19.801 --> 06:22.134
Or my
"beauti-fool" wife.

06:23.000 --> 06:23.999
Kids...

06:24.033 --> 06:25.567
what you're
looking at

06:25.601 --> 06:29.834
is the world-famous
Kaiser air-cooling blatz.

06:29.868 --> 06:31.667
The Jerries
swore by these.

06:31.701 --> 06:33.033
But, more importantly,

06:33.067 --> 06:36.633
they were at the forefront
of 1942 technology.

06:37.200 --> 06:38.166
And now...

06:38.200 --> 06:41.633
this baby's
ours, Peg.

06:41.667 --> 06:45.034
This is the best damn
17 bucks I ever spent.

06:50.033 --> 06:52.967
God, I must have
loved you once.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.233
You don't know
what love is

06:55.267 --> 06:56.366
till you've
been kissed

06:56.400 --> 06:59.467
by the cool lips
of a Kaiser.

06:59.501 --> 07:01.200
Bud, help me out
in the car.

07:01.234 --> 07:03.900
I wanna bring in
the main part. Ugh.

07:04.868 --> 07:06.867
And then we'll be
as cool

07:06.901 --> 07:09.334
as I remember myself
in high school.

07:13.267 --> 07:14.800
Gee, Mom.

07:14.834 --> 07:17.700
Thanks for the precious
gift of life.

07:32.100 --> 07:34.667
Bud! You got it
all spliced in?!

07:34.701 --> 07:36.400
Yeah, Dad.

07:36.434 --> 07:39.167
Right into the
city's transformer.

07:40.734 --> 07:42.966
Dad...is
this legal?

07:43.000 --> 07:44.500
No!

07:45.000 --> 07:47.667
So don't use
any names.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.066
Bud, come down now.

07:49.100 --> 07:51.967
Kelly, keep the flashlight on
till he gets all the way--

07:55.167 --> 07:56.467
Dad.

07:56.501 --> 07:57.467
I got it.

07:57.501 --> 07:59.934
He's down,
Daddy.

08:01.133 --> 08:02.834
No names.

08:04.467 --> 08:05.834
Peg...

08:05.868 --> 08:09.167
you wanna go upstairs and get
some blankets and sweater?

08:10.000 --> 08:12.867
Oh, turn it on, mongo.

08:18.067 --> 08:19.967
Nice fall, Bud.

08:20.467 --> 08:21.834
Now...

08:21.868 --> 08:24.266
we are
ready.

08:24.300 --> 08:25.533
Peg...

08:25.567 --> 08:27.800
would you do
the honors, please?

08:37.801 --> 08:38.966
Easy, Peg.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.767
You're not
having sex with it.

08:45.200 --> 08:47.233
Well...we'll know
for sure

08:47.267 --> 08:48.900
if it quits
after 10 seconds

08:48.934 --> 08:49.966
and asks what's on TV.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.533
Ah.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.733
You know,
this could be you.

08:56.767 --> 08:58.967
I don't feel a thing.

09:00.801 --> 09:03.067
Just keep cranking.

09:03.868 --> 09:05.633
There.
Listen to that.

09:05.667 --> 09:07.099
The satisfying
hum

09:07.133 --> 09:09.567
of fine German
engineering.

09:13.167 --> 09:15.201
Brrr.

09:16.133 --> 09:17.099
Is it just me,

09:17.133 --> 09:19.767
or is it getting
warmer in here?

09:19.801 --> 09:21.600
I guess that's because
I've got it on...

09:21.634 --> 09:23.834
<i>uh, "der low."</i>

09:24.534 --> 09:26.333
Let's turn this up.

09:26.367 --> 09:29.600
I'll turn this up
to "blitzkrieg."

09:31.467 --> 09:32.767
There. What do you
feel now?

09:32.801 --> 09:33.767
Anger.
Disgust.

09:33.801 --> 09:35.066
Loathing.
Disappointment.

09:35.100 --> 09:37.001
All right. All right.
All right.

09:37.801 --> 09:40.667
I'll just ease
this baby up to

09:40.701 --> 09:43.001
<i>"der freezing
my heinie off."</i>

09:44.133 --> 09:46.934
Ugh. There, that ought
to shut you up.

09:48.100 --> 09:49.066
It's gonna blow.

09:49.100 --> 09:50.734
Whoa, run!

09:54.300 --> 09:56.567
Brrr.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.567
Good news, Dad.

09:59.601 --> 10:01.934
It's not just
our house.

10:03.767 --> 10:04.867
Oh.

10:04.901 --> 10:07.300
The whole neighborhood's
gone dark.

10:07.334 --> 10:09.767
Well, at least they don't
know it's our fault.

10:09.801 --> 10:11.800
Bundy did this!

10:11.834 --> 10:14.733
Bundy. Bundy. Bundy.

10:14.767 --> 10:16.200
God, where'd
they get the torches

10:16.234 --> 10:17.867
and the pitchforks
so fast?

10:17.901 --> 10:18.900
Shut up!

10:18.934 --> 10:20.366
Put your weight
against the door.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.267
They're coming in.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.633
Well,
Desert Fox...

10:41.000 --> 10:43.934
Well, Desert Fox,
where will you lead us now?

10:43.968 --> 10:45.900
Ha-ha.
You fools.

10:45.934 --> 10:47.400
Do you think
I only had one plan

10:47.434 --> 10:49.333
to get us air conditioning
and keep us cool?

10:49.367 --> 10:50.333
Ha.

10:50.367 --> 10:51.366
No. Trust me.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.066
Air conditioning
ye want,

10:53.100 --> 10:55.800
air conditioning
ye shall have.

11:04.567 --> 11:05.533
Ah.

11:05.567 --> 11:08.034
I wonder what the poor
people are doing.

11:16.334 --> 11:19.201
Did I promise you
the good life?

11:20.367 --> 11:21.767
Honey, if only
everyone could be

11:21.801 --> 11:23.266
as happy as we are.

11:23.300 --> 11:25.800
Everybody doesn't
have me, babe.

11:34.834 --> 11:36.600
Oh, that poor
woman.

11:36.634 --> 11:37.767
You know,
it just shows

11:37.801 --> 11:39.266
that there can be
unhappiness

11:39.300 --> 11:42.067
in even a grand
place like...

11:42.734 --> 11:44.667
What'd you call
this place again?

11:44.701 --> 11:47.034
Supermarket, babe.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.266
Supermarket.

11:51.300 --> 11:53.301
Wow.

11:55.367 --> 11:57.667
A big building
with food.
Mm.

11:57.701 --> 11:59.800
What'll they
think of next?

12:01.133 --> 12:02.934
Free sample?

12:03.834 --> 12:06.067
Uh, thank you,
cheese lady.

12:12.534 --> 12:13.834
Listen, i-if you see
the lady

12:13.868 --> 12:15.233
with the little
tray of weenies,

12:15.267 --> 12:17.034
tell her
we've been waiting.

12:18.634 --> 12:20.667
Oh, my hands are
all greasy from eating.

12:20.701 --> 12:23.200
Wh-where's Kelly
with my damn towel?

12:23.234 --> 12:25.067
Here I am, Daddy.

12:27.734 --> 12:28.934
Daddy...

12:28.968 --> 12:30.967
what's this?

12:31.968 --> 12:33.934
Looks like some kind
of vegetable, honey.

12:33.968 --> 12:35.533
Ew.

12:36.100 --> 12:38.567
Uh, Bud. Go deep.

12:38.601 --> 12:40.099
Ha-ha! Ha!

12:40.133 --> 12:42.167
Ha-ha!

12:47.868 --> 12:49.233
Excuse me here,
family, but, uh,

12:49.267 --> 12:50.800
as the only one among us

12:50.834 --> 12:52.333
who hasn't yet been
fingerprinted,

12:52.367 --> 12:54.200
do you actually think
no one's gonna notice

12:54.234 --> 12:56.700
we're living in aisle four
of a supermarket?

12:57.434 --> 12:59.233
Bud, we're
your parents.

12:59.267 --> 13:01.667
You let us worry about
what's right or wrong.

13:01.701 --> 13:03.600
Now, you go on over
to aisle 12

13:03.634 --> 13:05.333
and get Daddy
some slippers.

13:05.367 --> 13:06.567
Oh, and while
you're at it,

13:06.601 --> 13:08.767
get Mom some perfume,
too, huh?

13:09.400 --> 13:10.834
Oh, Al.

13:10.868 --> 13:13.401
You remembered
my birthday.

13:17.200 --> 13:18.500
Ahem.

13:18.534 --> 13:19.500
Folks, excuse me.

13:19.534 --> 13:20.767
What are you
doing here?

13:20.801 --> 13:23.266
What does it look like
we're doing here?

13:23.300 --> 13:25.368
We're shopping.

13:28.434 --> 13:30.867
You've been here
for four hours.

13:30.901 --> 13:32.966
Well, we're
conscientious shoppers.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.134
Peg, you wanna read me
the ingredients in those chips?

13:38.033 --> 13:40.201
"Potatoes."

13:43.367 --> 13:46.366
Nah. It's not quite
what I'm looking for.

13:46.400 --> 13:47.800
I may be
just a stock boy,

13:47.834 --> 13:49.200
but I know the look
of a family

13:49.234 --> 13:50.867
without
an air conditioner.

13:50.901 --> 13:52.633
I'm gonna have to
call the manager.

13:52.667 --> 13:54.600
Ah, now. W-wait a second.
Wait a second there.

13:54.634 --> 13:56.800
Uh, all right. You-- You look
like a smart young guy.

13:56.834 --> 13:59.401
I, uh, think maybe
I can trust you.

14:00.267 --> 14:01.500
Name's Bundy,
Al Bundy.

14:01.534 --> 14:04.667
I'm with the National
Supermarket Security Agency.

14:08.267 --> 14:09.366
There has been
a rash

14:09.400 --> 14:11.166
of food-related
food thefts in the area,

14:11.200 --> 14:13.033
and that's what--
That's what I'm here for.

14:13.067 --> 14:15.200
Bundy.
I carry a whistle.

14:15.234 --> 14:17.700
Whoa. Really?

14:17.734 --> 14:19.700
Now,
act natural.

14:19.734 --> 14:21.066
See that, uh,
woman over there?

14:21.100 --> 14:22.700
Don't
look.

14:22.734 --> 14:25.600
That's
Velveeta Annie.

14:27.234 --> 14:29.733
The notorious blue-haired
cheese bandit.

14:29.767 --> 14:33.266
I've been on her trail
since the Dakotas.

14:33.300 --> 14:34.567
Mrs. Gillis?

14:34.601 --> 14:36.533
She's been shopping
here for years.

14:36.567 --> 14:39.300
Kid, don't you know
that Gillis

14:39.334 --> 14:42.667
is the underworld name
for "cheese booster?"

14:45.200 --> 14:47.233
Are you sure about this,
Special Agent Bundy-- ?

14:47.267 --> 14:48.800
Don't-- Don't look
at her now.

14:48.834 --> 14:50.433
I-- I think she's
making her move.

14:50.467 --> 14:52.001
Uh...

14:53.667 --> 14:55.567
Let's
see what...

14:55.601 --> 14:57.400
Yeah, I think
we got her now.

14:57.434 --> 14:59.733
Yeah, I think
the eagle has landed.

14:59.767 --> 15:01.934
Uh, listen...I don't
want to make this bust

15:01.968 --> 15:02.934
and blow my cover,

15:02.968 --> 15:04.133
so you take it,
kid.

15:04.167 --> 15:06.900
Thank you,
Special Agent Bundy.

15:08.434 --> 15:12.999
<i>So...how do you like
our cheese, Gillis?</i>

15:13.033 --> 15:15.266
<i>Hopefully as much
as you like our jails.</i>

15:15.300 --> 15:16.266
Come along, baby.

15:16.300 --> 15:18.434
Bobby, what's
come over you?

15:22.567 --> 15:25.800
But-- But I was
your kindergarten teacher.

15:25.834 --> 15:27.368
Ohh!

15:31.300 --> 15:33.767
Gee, Al, you think
we did the right thing?

15:34.300 --> 15:36.433
Ah. So an old lady
goes to jail.

15:36.467 --> 15:38.334
So who gets hurt?

15:39.100 --> 15:40.500
This is living,
isn't it, babe?

15:40.534 --> 15:41.867
Yeah.

15:41.901 --> 15:43.033
Oh, look.

15:43.067 --> 15:45.099
Isn't that the family
of poor people

15:45.133 --> 15:46.867
everyone says
is living here?

15:46.901 --> 15:48.900
Isn't it
pathetic?

15:48.934 --> 15:51.368
Get a job,
buddy.

15:53.501 --> 15:55.366
Why, you little--

15:55.400 --> 15:57.667
You know, I have half a mind
to move us to aisle six

15:57.701 --> 15:59.733
and not tell him.

15:59.767 --> 16:02.066
Well, I'm bored.

16:02.100 --> 16:03.934
I'm gonna go
boost us a radio.

16:03.968 --> 16:05.133
Does anyone want anything?

16:05.167 --> 16:06.600
Well, how about
some plants?

16:06.634 --> 16:08.667
You know,
for ambience?

16:08.701 --> 16:10.401
How about you,
Daddy?

16:18.000 --> 16:19.467
Uh, miss?

16:19.501 --> 16:22.234
Uh, excuse me. I-I think
you dropped something.

16:25.968 --> 16:28.101
Thank you,
market dweller.

16:31.267 --> 16:33.001
Daddy.

16:33.834 --> 16:35.266
What?!

16:35.300 --> 16:37.301
Do you want
anything?

16:37.801 --> 16:39.600
Mm. Yes, I...

16:39.634 --> 16:40.800
have a strange
yearning

16:40.834 --> 16:42.867
for some melons.

16:47.033 --> 16:49.834
And a plucked chicken.

16:51.467 --> 16:53.966
Uh, I thought
I smelled shoes.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.500
Well, if it isn't
the "Vanderbundys"

16:56.534 --> 16:58.434
in their summer
home.

16:59.267 --> 17:00.333
Hi, Marcie.

17:00.367 --> 17:01.600
Are you having
a party?

17:01.634 --> 17:03.567
Uh, no.

17:03.601 --> 17:06.233
Thanks to Al, I and the rest
of the block

17:06.267 --> 17:08.733
are sweltering to death
in our own homes.

17:08.767 --> 17:10.233
A- are they still mad at me?

17:10.267 --> 17:13.266
For blacking out
the entire neighborhood

17:13.300 --> 17:14.965
on the hottest day
of the year?

17:15.000 --> 17:16.266
Heck, no.

17:16.300 --> 17:18.767
In fact, it's brought us
all closer together.

17:18.800 --> 17:21.098
Why, when we were
burning you in effigy,

17:21.133 --> 17:23.767
I ran into people
I hadn't seen in years.

17:23.800 --> 17:26.700
We sat around, we sang
our favorite folk songs,

17:26.733 --> 17:28.300
like, "If I Had a Hammer,

17:28.334 --> 17:30.900
I'd Drive It Through
Al Bundy's Skull."

17:31.534 --> 17:33.633
You know, Marcie,
we just feel terrible

17:33.667 --> 17:35.033
about this whole
mess.

17:35.067 --> 17:36.600
Don't we, Al?

17:39.701 --> 17:40.667
Oh, miss,

17:40.701 --> 17:43.001
I think you dropped
your corn.

17:43.634 --> 17:45.366
Oops. Thank you.

17:45.400 --> 17:47.434
<i>Thank you.</i>

17:58.100 --> 17:59.266
Oh, miss.

17:59.300 --> 18:01.700
Uh, you dropped
your flea fogger.

18:01.734 --> 18:03.900
Oops.

18:04.467 --> 18:05.467
Thank you.

18:05.501 --> 18:08.134
No, thankyou.

18:14.567 --> 18:16.200
Uh, miss.

18:16.234 --> 18:18.767
Ooh-- You dropped
your broccoli spears.

18:18.801 --> 18:20.500
Oh.

18:21.567 --> 18:22.800
Thanks again.

18:22.834 --> 18:24.800
No, thankyou.

18:26.767 --> 18:28.800
Bud. Here's
something men do.

18:28.834 --> 18:30.667
Quick. Get me
something.

18:35.734 --> 18:37.600
Excuse me,
miss.

18:37.634 --> 18:39.567
Uh, you dropped
your, uh...

18:39.601 --> 18:41.368
eggs.

18:42.934 --> 18:44.266
Weren't you
the same guy

18:44.300 --> 18:46.433
that was rubbing up
against me at the bus?

18:46.467 --> 18:47.733
No.

18:47.767 --> 18:49.800
<i>I meant him.</i>

18:57.400 --> 18:59.034
You little...

18:59.667 --> 19:00.900
He-he-he.

19:00.934 --> 19:03.233
Cheese security?

19:03.267 --> 19:04.366
I saw his credentials.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.633
They say
he's the best.

19:06.667 --> 19:08.500
I don't know.

19:08.534 --> 19:11.101
I got my doubts
about this guy.

19:15.801 --> 19:19.333
I know I know
that face from somewhere.

19:19.367 --> 19:21.099
What'd you say
his name was?

19:21.133 --> 19:24.166
Bundy. Al Bundy.

19:24.200 --> 19:26.633
I'm gonna
check him out.

19:37.334 --> 19:39.633
Yellow alert.
Yellow alert.

19:42.601 --> 19:43.900
So...

19:43.934 --> 19:45.966
you're
the dairy spy.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.767
Why don't you just announce it
to the whole store.

19:48.801 --> 19:50.767
You're on report,
buddy.

19:50.801 --> 19:51.767
Kelly...

19:51.801 --> 19:54.066
...give me a pen.

19:54.100 --> 19:55.834
Blue or red?

19:55.868 --> 19:57.066
Uh...

19:57.100 --> 19:58.467
Uh, blue.

19:58.501 --> 20:01.067
Fine point
or husky?
Uh...

20:02.167 --> 20:03.934
Never mind, pumpkin.

20:03.968 --> 20:05.999
Wait a minute.
Al Bundy.

20:06.033 --> 20:07.633
Of course.

20:07.667 --> 20:09.767
You've been dribbling
checks all over town.

20:09.801 --> 20:12.300
Listen. Buy something
or get out.

20:12.334 --> 20:13.533
Alrighty. Peg...

20:13.567 --> 20:14.533
...checkbook.

20:14.567 --> 20:15.966
No. Cash only, Bundy.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.401
And I still want
two forms of ID.

20:20.501 --> 20:23.267
You just lost yourself
some business, buster.

20:23.834 --> 20:25.300
Kids, let's go.
We're moving down

20:25.334 --> 20:27.066
to the drugstore
down the street.

20:27.100 --> 20:28.300
Buy something,

20:28.334 --> 20:30.567
or you'll be moving
into the county jail.

20:30.601 --> 20:32.600
Alrighty.

20:32.634 --> 20:34.334
Family meeting.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.867
Kids, you got
any money for old Dad?

20:42.200 --> 20:44.133
Eighteen cents.

20:44.167 --> 20:46.033
When I said I needed
a battery for the Kaiser,

20:46.067 --> 20:47.400
you said you didn't
have a dime.

20:47.434 --> 20:50.667
No, we said we "didn't
give a damn."

20:50.701 --> 20:54.400
Boy, how soon they forget
the good times.

20:54.434 --> 20:56.300
All right, come on.
Let's see what we can buy.

20:56.334 --> 20:58.368
Peg, bring
the cart.

20:59.334 --> 21:01.167
How do I work
this thing?

21:01.901 --> 21:03.133
The same thing
you do with me.

21:03.167 --> 21:05.867
You just get behind it,
and you shove.

21:16.767 --> 21:18.066
Uh, Marce,
listen.

21:18.100 --> 21:20.066
Uh, I've only got
a pack of gum.

21:20.100 --> 21:22.633
Uh, could I get
in front of you?

21:22.667 --> 21:24.700
Eat hot death.

21:26.167 --> 21:27.900
<i>Oh, The National
Enquire.</i>

21:27.934 --> 21:30.233
"Steve Rhoades
Marries Cher."

21:30.267 --> 21:31.767
Where? Where?

21:39.534 --> 21:41.366
Congratulations,
sir.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.600
You're our
one millionthcustomer.

21:43.634 --> 21:45.033
Well, w-what does
that mean?

21:45.067 --> 21:49.468
You've won a free $1000
supermarket shopping spree.

21:49.968 --> 21:51.733
Hey. I was
the next in line.

21:51.767 --> 21:53.400
Well, what are you
complaining about?

21:53.434 --> 21:55.067
You still are.

21:55.567 --> 21:57.533
We won.
We won.

21:57.567 --> 22:01.033
We won. We won.
We won. We won.

22:01.067 --> 22:02.700
We won.

22:03.334 --> 22:05.401
Oh,

22:06.601 --> 22:08.600
Oh,
we won!
