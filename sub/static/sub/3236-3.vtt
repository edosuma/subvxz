00:00.005 --> 00:02.878
Previously on AMC's
Breaking Bad...

00:03.004 --> 00:04.949
So, first order of business is

00:05.077 --> 00:06.566
to find a new place to cook.

00:06.670 --> 00:07.970
Partnership.
Three ways.

00:08.127 --> 00:09.357
No, thanks.

00:09.454 --> 00:10.371
These men were on payroll.

00:10.512 --> 00:11.464
My guys are solid.

00:11.568 --> 00:13.288
They're paid to stand
up to the heat.

00:13.405 --> 00:14.438
I am scared.

00:14.563 --> 00:15.721
- Of what?
- You.

00:15.846 --> 00:18.308
Fring had all these
secret off shore accounts.

00:18.427 --> 00:19.598
He's not impressed, Gomie.

00:19.770 --> 00:23.043
Perhaps he's picturing all
that money going bye-bye.

00:23.160 --> 00:25.088
Can you still get your
hands on methylamine?

00:25.240 --> 00:26.588
Maybe, why?

00:26.684 --> 00:28.468
I reconsidered, I'm in.

00:28.614 --> 00:29.627
Good.

00:33.720 --> 00:35.721
[Beeping]

00:39.025 --> 00:41.593
- Hey, Darla. How you doing today?
- Hey, Dan.

00:41.628 --> 00:43.594
I'm looking for something
in a Markowski.

00:43.629 --> 00:46.831
That'd be, uh,
Dennis Markowski?

00:46.865 --> 00:48.799
That's the one.

00:52.170 --> 00:54.972
Oh, and I've got my, uh,
paralegal with me today.

00:55.007 --> 00:57.441
Paralegal?
Coming up in the world.

00:57.475 --> 00:58.990
You know it.

01:17.927 --> 01:19.762
Hey, Dennis.

01:19.796 --> 01:21.797
Have a seat.

01:46.489 --> 01:48.489
<i>You hear about Chow?</i>

01:49.491 --> 01:51.725
Yeah, people say
he skipped town.

01:51.759 --> 01:53.561
He's dead.

01:54.564 --> 01:56.564
It wasn't me.

01:56.565 --> 01:58.666
It wasn't a message.
It wasn't payback.

01:58.700 --> 02:01.068
It was a mistake
made by a third party

02:01.102 --> 02:02.703
who has since been dealt with.

02:02.737 --> 02:04.036
You got it?

02:04.071 --> 02:05.705
- Yeah.
- The second thing...

02:05.739 --> 02:09.309
The deal you had with Fring--
it's still in place.

02:09.342 --> 02:10.476
Okay.

02:10.511 --> 02:12.478
Don't "okay" me.

02:12.513 --> 02:14.547
You got something to say?

02:16.217 --> 02:19.185
Mike, I'm keeping
my mouth shut.

02:19.219 --> 02:21.320
The laundry
was right above the lab.

02:21.354 --> 02:23.088
There's no way I could say
I wasn't in on it.

02:23.089 --> 02:26.325
I'm looking
at eight years minimum.

02:26.359 --> 02:28.527
But I'm doing my time
like I'm supposed to.

02:28.561 --> 02:31.396
I'm no rat, and you know it.

02:31.431 --> 02:33.398
What else is there to say?

02:33.433 --> 02:35.233
All due respect,
what are we talking about here?

02:35.267 --> 02:37.602
The deal is the deal.

02:41.840 --> 02:43.807
How's the deal the deal?

02:43.842 --> 02:45.809
The feds took away
my hazard pay.

02:45.844 --> 02:48.646
My wife comes to me and asks me
where the mortgage is coming from.

02:48.680 --> 02:50.047
I got nothing to tell her.

02:50.081 --> 02:53.650
I knew the risks. We all did.
But that wasn't the deal.

02:53.684 --> 02:56.553
And I know for a fact they got
Holt and Perez yesterday.

02:56.587 --> 02:59.723
Now, it's not gonna be me,
but absent the hazard pay,

02:59.758 --> 03:01.258
sooner or later,
someone's gonna flip.

03:01.292 --> 03:02.926
No one's flipping.

03:02.961 --> 03:05.595
Everyone gets their hazard pay,
including you.

03:05.630 --> 03:07.597
I appreciate what you're
saying and all,

03:07.632 --> 03:09.932
but the man is dead.

03:09.967 --> 03:12.935
Okay? The lab's
a hole in the ground.

03:12.970 --> 03:15.604
- I just don't see it.
- I've got something new.

03:15.639 --> 03:18.941
It's just starting up.
It's gonna make you whole.

03:18.976 --> 03:21.010
Something new?
With the feds looking at you?

03:21.044 --> 03:23.179
- How?
- "How" is my business.

03:23.213 --> 03:25.480
Hanging tight's your business.

03:25.514 --> 03:27.182
Your family's gonna be fine.

03:27.216 --> 03:29.885
You will be made whole.

03:29.919 --> 03:32.420
Now, you got my word.

03:32.454 --> 03:34.656
You need more?

03:38.094 --> 03:40.194
No, Mike. I'm good.

03:40.228 --> 03:42.663
<i>â™ª [Muted rock continues]</i>

03:42.697 --> 03:44.698
[Mike] Who's next?

03:44.732 --> 03:46.500
That's your choice.

03:46.534 --> 03:48.035
APD's got Martinez across town.

03:48.069 --> 03:49.603
Up in Sandoval.

03:49.637 --> 03:51.705
The Sandia tribal cops
are holding him for the feds.

03:51.739 --> 03:53.207
[Alarm buzzes]

03:53.241 --> 03:56.542
And Holt and Perez
are in lockup in Los Lunas.

03:56.576 --> 03:58.978
You don't mean
to get to them all today?

03:59.013 --> 04:00.613
Yeah, I do.

04:00.647 --> 04:03.883
Hey, let's go!

[Chuckles]

05:08.348 --> 05:11.116
Oh, hi.
How was your day?

05:12.820 --> 05:16.322
Um, are-- are you
moving back in?

05:16.356 --> 05:17.323
Yeah.

05:17.357 --> 05:19.558
I'll keep the condo for now,

05:19.592 --> 05:22.527
selling it in this market,
I'd get killed.

05:22.562 --> 05:25.897
But, yeah, I'm home.

05:25.932 --> 05:27.433
It's time.

05:30.635 --> 05:33.171
Do you, uh, really think
that's-- that's a good idea?

05:34.806 --> 05:36.307
Yes.

[Labored breathing]

05:57.161 --> 05:59.863
[Labored breathing continues]

06:02.632 --> 06:09.005
[Saul] So you bring him here? Come on.
The three of us? We're the three amigos!

06:09.039 --> 06:10.839
All for one, one for all.

06:10.874 --> 06:14.510
We don't need a fourth amigo.

06:14.544 --> 06:17.745
Saul, Mike knows the business.
He knows distributors.

06:17.779 --> 06:22.183
- Mike's okay. - He's okay? He said
he was gonna break my legs.

06:22.218 --> 06:24.552
And don't tell me
he didn't mean it, okay?

06:24.586 --> 06:27.622
'Cause he gave me the dead mackerel eyes.
He meant it.

06:27.656 --> 06:30.058
[Walt] Saul, Mike threatened me.
He threatened Jesse.

06:30.092 --> 06:32.994
He probably threatened someone
before breakfast this morning.

06:33.028 --> 06:36.296
It's what he does.
Come on. Grow a pair.

06:39.734 --> 06:43.003
Let it be noted
that I do this under duress.

06:43.038 --> 06:44.371
Duly noted.

06:46.574 --> 06:49.208
All right.
Let him in, Huell.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.589
Mike,
I'm extending you the--

07:03.623 --> 07:05.557
Uh-huh.

07:05.591 --> 07:09.694
Now that we're all together,
here are the ground rules...

07:09.728 --> 07:13.164
Division of labor--
I handle the business.

07:13.198 --> 07:15.533
Making the stuff--
that's your end.

07:15.568 --> 07:17.501
I don't tell you how to mix

07:17.536 --> 07:19.236
your chemicals and whatnot,

07:19.271 --> 07:21.439
and you do not tell me

07:21.473 --> 07:23.207
how to take care of business.

07:23.241 --> 07:26.243
Is that absolutely clear?

07:32.450 --> 07:33.917
Sure.

07:33.952 --> 07:35.953
All right.
Let's take the tour.

07:37.755 --> 07:39.089
[Door opens]

07:40.091 --> 07:43.060
Hey, you're okay with that?

07:43.094 --> 07:44.160
Yes.

07:44.195 --> 07:46.462
He handles the business,

07:46.496 --> 07:48.564
and I handle him.

07:54.204 --> 07:56.371
[Saul] Clearly, we're talking
about renting, not buying.

07:56.406 --> 07:57.974
You need
an ongoing business--

07:58.008 --> 08:00.242
someplace you can slide in,
do your thing,

08:00.276 --> 08:01.576
and remain anonymous.

08:01.611 --> 08:03.244
I'm not gonna mince words.

08:03.278 --> 08:05.246
This is your best bet.

08:05.280 --> 08:07.082
Got machines running,

08:07.116 --> 08:09.818
forklifts,
people coming and going.

08:09.852 --> 08:12.821
You're gonna stay
way under the radar.

08:12.822 --> 08:14.322
And the owner's solid.

08:14.356 --> 08:16.690
He can't wait to throw up
a curtain wall,

08:16.725 --> 08:19.392
stack some boxes in front of it,
give you all the space you need.

08:19.427 --> 08:22.362
After that, he's got his
business, you've got yours,

08:22.396 --> 08:24.064
and never the twain shall meet.

08:24.099 --> 08:26.233
It's outstanding.
Am I right?

08:26.267 --> 08:29.637
Machines like this--
gotta be plenty of power.

08:29.671 --> 08:31.204
What about the smell?

08:31.239 --> 08:32.506
Ah. More good news.

08:32.539 --> 08:34.206
I've been here
when it's up and running.

08:34.241 --> 08:36.808
This place stinks already.
You'll blend right in.

08:36.844 --> 08:38.344
How many employees?

08:38.378 --> 08:39.912
Ha. I knew you'd ask.

08:39.947 --> 08:42.048
Sixteen illegals,

08:42.082 --> 08:45.317
all highly motivated
to stay deaf, blind and dumb.

08:45.352 --> 08:47.353
You'll want to vet them,
I'm sure.

08:47.387 --> 08:49.454
Yes, indeed.

08:49.488 --> 08:51.389
So what do you say, maestro?

08:51.423 --> 08:53.825
Huh?
Is it unanimous?

08:53.860 --> 08:56.528
You know, I worked in a box factory
one summer in high school,

08:56.562 --> 09:00.198
I haven't seen
one of these in years.

09:00.232 --> 09:02.467
Trip down memory lane.
That's perfect.

09:02.501 --> 09:03.835
You know what this is?

09:03.870 --> 09:05.870
It's a corrugator.

09:05.904 --> 09:07.638
It uses steam and salt

09:07.673 --> 09:10.071
to crimp kraft paper
for cardboard.

09:10.297 --> 09:13.978
And it makes a hell of * doing it,
which is great, right?

09:14.012 --> 09:15.713
No.

09:15.747 --> 09:17.381
Steam and salt.

09:17.415 --> 09:20.817
When this thing is running,
it's like a jungle in here.

09:20.851 --> 09:24.954
Shit.
It'll ruin the product.

09:24.989 --> 09:27.490
Well, you can't just
hop down to Costco

09:27.524 --> 09:29.659
and get a couple dehumidifiers?

09:29.694 --> 09:33.830
What-- fine. Fine.
Moving on.

09:38.868 --> 09:41.737
Spacious, isolated location,

09:41.771 --> 09:43.205
no humidity,

09:43.239 --> 09:45.140
and you get all
the free tortillas you want.

09:45.175 --> 09:48.877
That's the special feature
of this place.

09:48.912 --> 09:50.679
Yeah... I don't know.

09:50.714 --> 09:52.847
It'll make the tortillas
smell like cat piss.

09:52.881 --> 09:55.516
Somebody's bound to notice that.

09:55.550 --> 09:58.352
All right. Well, there's gotta be
some kind of workaround, right?

09:58.386 --> 10:01.488
It's a technical problem.
You guys are technical guys.

10:01.523 --> 10:03.725
You know, be creative.
Put your heads together.

10:03.759 --> 10:05.659
Anything food-related

10:05.694 --> 10:08.062
is gonna have unannounced
government inspections.

10:17.171 --> 10:20.201
All I'm asking is that
you keep an open mind.

10:20.356 --> 10:23.309
Dennis' already set some spaces
behind these keepball games.

10:23.310 --> 10:25.277
[Scoffs] No.

10:25.311 --> 10:27.512
Hell, no.

10:35.655 --> 10:37.689
I know it's a long shot.

10:37.724 --> 10:40.825
All I can say
to recommend this one

10:40.860 --> 10:43.128
is we're talking about
an owner here who is--

10:43.162 --> 10:45.930
how should I put it--
highly amenable.

10:49.802 --> 10:53.138
Okay. I get it. Just say no,
and we'll go get dinner.

10:53.172 --> 10:55.706
All right.
So I'll start.

10:55.741 --> 10:57.440
No way we're cooking in here.

10:57.475 --> 11:00.543
No space,
nowhere for the smell to go.

11:00.578 --> 11:02.112
Look at that door.

11:02.147 --> 11:04.248
That thing rolls up,
and we're open to the world.

11:04.282 --> 11:06.250
[Mike] I don't know
if anybody noticed,

11:06.284 --> 11:08.551
but there's a cop shop
a quarter of a mile away.

11:08.586 --> 11:10.553
The hammer comes down,

11:10.588 --> 11:12.790
it's gonna be
custer's last stand.

11:16.226 --> 11:17.894
It's perfect.

11:17.928 --> 11:19.228
What?

11:19.263 --> 11:21.831
How are we gonna fit
a lab in here?

11:22.833 --> 11:24.734
Who said here?

11:38.082 --> 11:40.283
<i>[Walt] A house is infested.</i>

11:40.317 --> 11:43.552
Termites,
cockroaches, whatever.

11:43.587 --> 11:47.290
Homeowners hire
a pest control company.

11:47.324 --> 11:50.158
Truck rolls up,
homeowners leave.

11:50.193 --> 11:52.327
The crew tents the house.

11:52.362 --> 11:54.963
They bomb the place
with poison.

11:54.998 --> 11:57.366
The house stays like that
for days.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.534
No one looks twice
at a tented house.

11:59.568 --> 12:02.170
Now, maybe there's a strange
smell coming out of it.

12:02.205 --> 12:04.005
Does someone think
to investigate? No.

12:04.039 --> 12:07.508
Anyone go inside?
Hell, no.

12:10.645 --> 12:12.846
And that's where we'll cook.

12:14.716 --> 12:18.585
They tent, what,
three, four houses a week?

12:18.620 --> 12:20.853
So we pick the one
that's best for us--

12:20.888 --> 12:23.156
enough floor space,
easy access.

12:23.190 --> 12:24.824
Once the tent is up,

12:24.858 --> 12:26.759
we go in, we cook a batch,

12:26.794 --> 12:30.262
we bomb the place, and leave.

12:30.297 --> 12:33.533
So we gotta move
in and out for every cook?

12:33.567 --> 12:37.470
Set up the lab, cook,
and then take everything down?

12:37.504 --> 12:40.606
It's challenging but doable.

12:40.641 --> 12:43.910
Tell me about these guys.

12:43.944 --> 12:46.812
Uh, Mr. ponytail
on the sidewalk-- that's Ira.

12:46.846 --> 12:49.648
He's the owner.
On the roof is Sandor.

12:49.682 --> 12:51.216
The ladder's Fernando,

12:51.251 --> 12:52.884

12:52.919 --> 12:54.553
The pest control operation
is legit.

12:54.587 --> 12:56.322
I mean, they're licensed,
they're bonded,

12:56.356 --> 12:58.623
they do as good a job
as anyone in town,

12:58.658 --> 13:02.126
but they're also top-drawer
second-story men.

13:02.161 --> 13:03.328
"Second-story"?

13:03.362 --> 13:05.496

13:05.530 --> 13:07.498
They're burglars.

13:07.532 --> 13:09.434
Yeah. I mean, hey,
they play it smart.

13:09.468 --> 13:11.802
They don't boost anything
while they're on the job.

13:11.837 --> 13:15.139
They copy the keys, locate
the valuables and alarms,

13:15.174 --> 13:17.574
and they sell that information
to other crews.

13:17.608 --> 13:19.409
Or, after a decent interval,

13:19.444 --> 13:21.711
they'll come back and live
for goods themselves.

to keep their mouths shut.

13:32.789 --> 13:34.890

they're gonna stay bought.

13:34.924 --> 13:37.426

into them yourself.

13:37.461 --> 13:40.896

Everything's the same

16:46.639 --> 16:48.874
- No stealing.
- No stealing.

Nothing.
And I mean nothing.

16:55.547 --> 16:57.048
And if you're out
with your buddies

16:57.083 --> 16:59.751
and they ask if you got
a hot tip on a B&E,

16:59.786 --> 17:01.418
you tell them you got nada.

17:01.452 --> 17:03.420
You're out of the game.
The bottom line is

17:03.454 --> 17:06.323
that these houses are out
of bounds now and forever.

17:06.757 --> 17:08.692

From time to time,
you're gonna see these two.

Now, as far as you're concerned,
they are ghosts.

17:16.167 --> 17:18.233
You don't see them.
You don't hear them.

17:18.269 --> 17:19.734
You don't
say "good morning."

17:19.770 --> 17:23.772
You don't speak
unless you're spoken to.

17:23.808 --> 17:25.809
On the other hand,

17:25.810 --> 17:27.777
if they tell you to jump,

17:27.811 --> 17:29.578
you don't ask what for,

17:29.613 --> 17:31.080
you jump.

17:31.115 --> 17:32.682
Now, you need a name for them?

17:33.817 --> 17:36.585
You call them "yes, sir"
and "no, sir."

17:38.888 --> 17:42.324
You got any problems,
you come to me.

17:42.358 --> 17:44.359
Here's the deal...

17:44.393 --> 17:46.394
The finishing tank's
a tight fit.

17:46.429 --> 17:48.463
And with this motor
you've got here on top--

17:48.498 --> 17:50.464
[Walt] The agitation motor.

17:50.499 --> 17:52.399
The agitation motor
here on top,

17:52.434 --> 17:54.102
the tank's not gonna
fit in the box.

17:54.136 --> 17:56.938
It's just, uh--
it's just too tall.

17:56.972 --> 17:59.306
Now, I thought we'd
put a collar on the tank

17:59.341 --> 18:01.375
and carry
the motor in separately,

18:01.409 --> 18:03.077
alongside the condenser.

18:03.112 --> 18:05.079
And on the day, we just kind of

18:05.114 --> 18:07.213
twist it into place,

while we're setting up.

18:10.685 --> 18:12.953

- That's good.
- Yeah.

18:15.056 --> 18:16.957
That will work.

can build it, right?

18:19.093 --> 18:23.029
Yeah. You know, they're, uh--
they're up for it.

18:23.063 --> 18:25.865
Joe already bought a TIG welder
for the aluminum work.

18:25.899 --> 18:27.800
And, you know,

18:27.834 --> 18:29.835
I figure if they
can pull off the magnet,

18:29.870 --> 18:31.837
they can handle this.

27:52.545 --> 27:55.079
it's a part of you, and...

27:57.416 --> 28:01.018
I mean, if you choose to spend the
rest of your life with this person,

28:02.921 --> 28:05.122
then you'll have to decide

28:05.156 --> 28:08.693
how much you'll share with her.

28:08.727 --> 28:12.930
Meaning what?
Like... everything?

28:15.265 --> 28:17.434
Like Gale?

28:24.208 --> 28:27.377
I'm just trying to say
that I trust you,

28:27.411 --> 28:31.313
and I know you'll make
the right call.

28:40.223 --> 28:42.691
If she loves you,

28:42.726 --> 28:44.760
she'll understand.

28:44.794 --> 28:47.829
[TV sound audible]

28:47.863 --> 28:50.665
They're leaving streaks.

28:50.699 --> 28:53.334
This more ethnic-looking one--
he's doing a great job.

28:53.369 --> 28:55.670
But the other one
is going back and forth

28:55.704 --> 28:57.438
like he's scrubbing a wall.

28:58.474 --> 29:01.242
They have to go in circles,

29:01.276 --> 29:03.677
or you're going
to leave streaks.

29:03.711 --> 29:06.413
That's pretty basic, right?

29:06.447 --> 29:09.649
Uh, I don't mean
to tell you your business.

29:09.684 --> 29:11.017
It's just-- it's--

29:11.051 --> 29:13.854
it's simple quality control.

29:16.624 --> 29:20.959
So, I've got some good news.

29:20.994 --> 29:22.495
Guess what.

29:22.529 --> 29:24.497
What?

29:24.531 --> 29:27.533
No, really.
I want you to guess.

29:28.703 --> 29:30.403
- Really, I really...
- Okay.

29:30.404 --> 29:31.871
Hank's back at work.

29:31.905 --> 29:34.606
- That's wonderful.
- Yeah.

29:34.640 --> 29:37.442
Sure, they love him now, but where
were they when he needed them?

29:37.476 --> 29:40.845
Merkert and all the rest-- they just
about laughed him out of the office

29:40.880 --> 29:44.616
when he told them about
that-- that chicken man.

29:44.650 --> 29:47.452
As far as I'm concerned,
too little too late.

29:47.486 --> 29:49.888
If it were me,
I'd tell them all to go to hell.

29:49.922 --> 29:52.656
Do I sound bitter?

29:52.690 --> 29:54.625
But it's--
it's what he wants, right?

29:54.659 --> 29:56.593
Yeah, it's doing him good.

29:56.628 --> 30:00.164
I mean, his PT
is going gangbusters.

30:00.198 --> 30:02.099
He's hardly using
his cane at all.

30:02.134 --> 30:05.269
And thank you for that, really.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.738
I mean, God knows where he'd be

30:07.772 --> 30:10.641
if we had to go through
his health plan.

30:10.675 --> 30:12.643
I'm just glad
he's feeling better.

30:12.677 --> 30:14.645
So, speaking of which,

30:14.679 --> 30:16.379
we have another
big event coming up.

30:16.414 --> 30:19.382
Have you thought about
what you're gonna do?

30:19.417 --> 30:21.384
Walt's birthday.

30:21.419 --> 30:23.986
Whatever you need, I'm here.

30:24.020 --> 30:26.656
Mm, yeah. I, um...

30:26.690 --> 30:29.058
I don't think we're gonna
do anything this year.

30:29.092 --> 30:30.559
What are you talking about?

30:30.593 --> 30:33.228
Of course we're
gonna do something.

30:33.263 --> 30:36.832
Skyler, he was diagnosed
around his birthday, right?

30:36.866 --> 30:38.500
I...

30:38.534 --> 30:40.502
So it's been a whole year.

30:40.536 --> 30:42.938
Listen, I've had
my problems with Walt.

30:42.973 --> 30:45.373
Why he wouldn't come to the house
when we were all practically beg--

30:45.407 --> 30:47.442
Whatever.
Water under the bridge.

30:47.476 --> 30:50.078
But at this point, every
year is precious. We are--

30:50.112 --> 30:51.712
What are you doing?

30:53.849 --> 30:55.549
You don't smoke.

30:55.550 --> 30:56.584
You haven't smoked
since college.

30:56.618 --> 30:58.453
You can't be serious!

30:58.487 --> 31:01.254
With the baby and Walt?

31:01.289 --> 31:03.290
Skyler, you're not smoking
around the baby, are you?

31:03.324 --> 31:04.958
And you can't smoke here.

31:04.993 --> 31:07.848
There's gotta be some rule
or regulation, I'm sure.

31:07.975 --> 31:10.612
You can't force your
employees to breathe--

31:10.647 --> 31:12.299
I know for a fact
that that is illegal.

31:12.333 --> 31:14.368
Marie, shut up.

31:14.402 --> 31:16.035
What?

31:16.069 --> 31:18.404
I'm sorry. Please don't
speak to me like that.

31:18.438 --> 31:20.306
- I am simply saying that you--
- Will you shut up?

31:20.340 --> 31:22.975
- Hey--
- Shut the hell up.

31:23.010 --> 31:25.444
- Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
- Skyler...

31:25.479 --> 31:27.579
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Please stop--

31:27.614 --> 31:30.282
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

31:30.317 --> 31:32.417
Shut up! Shut up!

31:32.451 --> 31:34.585
Shut up!

31:37.490 --> 31:40.925
[Crying]

31:45.276 --> 31:46.442
[Jesse]
That's a 5.23.

31:46.477 --> 31:48.778
[Walt]
5.23.

31:49.947 --> 31:51.081
Last one.

31:51.115 --> 31:52.815
[Scale beeps]

31:52.850 --> 31:55.285
5.26.

31:55.319 --> 31:57.387
5.26.

31:57.421 --> 32:02.958
That comes to 49.27.

32:02.993 --> 32:05.060
Good yield, right?

32:05.095 --> 32:08.330
That is an excellent yield.

32:09.832 --> 32:14.603
All right.

32:14.637 --> 32:16.638
[Gas hissing]

32:38.192 --> 32:46.166
[Car door closes]

32:46.200 --> 32:48.135
[Door opens]

32:49.403 --> 32:50.970
Hey Marie.

32:53.440 --> 32:55.441
How you doing?

32:59.446 --> 33:00.913
Where is Skyler?

33:00.948 --> 33:02.481
In the bedroom.
She's resting.

33:03.783 --> 33:06.117
Is everything okay?

33:06.152 --> 33:08.288
Breakdown? What does that--
what does that mean?

33:08.403 --> 33:10.284
It means I don't know
what else to call it.

33:10.490 --> 33:13.826
But I've never seen her
like that, ever.

33:14.894 --> 33:18.497
Well, what did she say
when she was yelling?

33:18.531 --> 33:19.565
Nothing.

33:19.599 --> 33:24.301
She just yelled, "Shut up, shut up,"
over and over again.

33:24.336 --> 33:26.170
Did you know she's smoking?

33:26.204 --> 33:28.105
Occasionally, maybe.

33:28.139 --> 33:31.141
It's not a regular thing.

33:31.176 --> 33:33.845
Oh, I just wish
I had gotten your message.

33:33.879 --> 33:35.746
"Messages," Walt.

33:35.781 --> 33:39.048
Plural. I probably
called you five times.

33:39.083 --> 33:40.917
[Mutters]

33:43.387 --> 33:46.155
I'm not leaving here until I
know what's got her so upset.

33:48.425 --> 33:53.329
Are you gambling again?
Is that what this is?

33:53.364 --> 33:55.731
Please, God, tell me
the cancer isn't back.

33:56.766 --> 34:00.569
No. It's not the cancer.

34:00.604 --> 34:02.170
Well, something happened.

34:02.205 --> 34:08.010
I don't mean to point the finger,
but this didn't just come out of nowhere.

34:08.043 --> 34:10.277
It's time to tell me
the truth, Walt. All of it.

34:11.514 --> 34:13.514
I mean it.

34:14.817 --> 34:16.684
You're right.

34:21.524 --> 34:23.925
[Sighs]

34:23.958 --> 34:26.092
You heard about Ted Beneke?

34:26.127 --> 34:28.094
The accident?

34:28.129 --> 34:29.862
What accident?

34:29.898 --> 34:31.864
Oh...

34:31.900 --> 34:33.967
Um...

34:34.002 --> 34:36.402
A couple weeks back,

34:36.437 --> 34:39.239
Ted took a fall--
a bad one.

34:39.273 --> 34:41.306
He gave himself a concussion,

34:41.342 --> 34:43.943
and, uh, fractured
a couple vertebrae.

34:43.976 --> 34:46.110
He's still in the hospital.

34:46.146 --> 34:48.047
He may never walk again.

34:48.081 --> 34:50.349
Oh, my God.
I-- I didn't--

34:50.382 --> 34:52.752
I didn't know.
I'm so sorry to hear that.

34:52.786 --> 34:54.485
Yeah.

34:55.656 --> 34:59.323
But that couldn't explain...
Skyler's--

34:59.358 --> 35:04.563
Uh... Yes.
Yes, it could.

35:10.069 --> 35:12.136
You do know, right?
You...

35:12.171 --> 35:14.504
You must know.

35:17.341 --> 35:19.109
Oh, God.

35:21.279 --> 35:23.814
She was having an affair...

35:23.848 --> 35:25.816
with Ted Beneke?

35:25.850 --> 35:28.185
Listen, listen.
It wasn't--

35:28.219 --> 35:30.486
it-- it wasn't...

35:30.520 --> 35:33.690
ongoing or anything, and...

35:35.759 --> 35:37.727
Well, Skyler and I
have been trying

35:37.761 --> 35:40.262
to put things back together.

35:40.297 --> 35:46.367
And then-- then the accident
happened, and she got...

35:48.905 --> 35:50.472
Marie, I'm begging you.

35:50.506 --> 35:51.974
Please, keep this to yourself.

35:52.008 --> 35:54.209
I don't want Hank
to think less of her...

35:54.243 --> 35:55.911
or me.

35:58.748 --> 36:01.182
When did you, um...

36:03.284 --> 36:05.620
Was she--
I'm gonna go.

36:05.654 --> 36:08.221
Okay. All right.

36:13.961 --> 36:15.929
[Sighs]

36:21.969 --> 36:23.469
[Mutters]

36:30.944 --> 36:32.410

Ahh!

39:11.161 --> 39:13.061
Okay.

39:13.096 --> 39:17.266
For you and you and me.
367,000 dollars each.

39:17.301 --> 39:20.235
Ooh. Wait a minute.

39:20.270 --> 39:22.771
After the dealers
got their cut,

39:22.805 --> 39:28.710
we should be looking
at 1,379,560.

39:28.711 --> 39:31.211
Mike, you're short.

39:31.314 --> 39:33.648
You're almost 300,000 short.

39:33.683 --> 39:35.317
You're forgetting
about the mules.

39:35.351 --> 39:36.984
They get a flat 20%.

39:37.019 --> 39:38.652
- The what?
- The drivers.

39:38.687 --> 39:42.023
They're the ones that take the
product from us to the dealers.

39:43.091 --> 39:47.695
And so, transportation
is worth 20%?

39:47.729 --> 39:49.864
They are taking a risk.

39:51.266 --> 39:55.702
$275,000 worth of risk?

39:55.736 --> 39:58.872
Wow.

39:58.906 --> 40:01.141
What did Gus pay his mules?

40:01.175 --> 40:03.977
Gustavo Fring didn't use mules.

40:04.011 --> 40:05.478
He didn't need them.

40:05.512 --> 40:08.348
He spent 20 years
building his own distribution.

40:08.382 --> 40:12.064
He had 16 refrigerator trucks
running his product.

40:12.352 --> 40:13.937
And you know
where they are now?

40:13.972 --> 40:16.355
Government impound.

40:16.389 --> 40:19.358
You don't like paying 20%?
Maybe you shouldn't have killed the guy.

Hey, hey, hey.

40:20.626 --> 40:22.928
There's still over
a million bucks here, all right?

40:22.963 --> 40:24.696
That's for one cook.

40:24.731 --> 40:27.531
And since you're putting on
the green eyeshade,

40:27.566 --> 40:29.533
my supplier and I
came to an agreement.

40:29.568 --> 40:31.769
The methylamine
was free this time.

40:31.803 --> 40:33.271
But brace yourself,

40:33.305 --> 40:36.140
because the next barrel
is gonna cost big.

40:37.609 --> 40:40.745
Can we continue, or you got
anymore burning questions?

[No audible dialogue]

40:44.282 --> 40:45.749
Okay, kid.

40:45.783 --> 40:49.419
You fronted us 120,000
to get us going.

40:49.453 --> 40:56.559
So that's 40,000
from him and me.

40:56.594 --> 40:58.827
Yes. Thank you, Jesse.

40:58.862 --> 41:00.096
Okay.

41:00.130 --> 41:04.633
Now, Ira gets 110,000
for our piece of the business

41:04.667 --> 41:07.303
and 25,000 per cook.

41:07.337 --> 41:09.372
That is 45,000...

41:10.374 --> 41:12.674
from each of us.

41:17.846 --> 41:21.449
Ira's guys get
10,000 each per cook.

41:27.456 --> 41:31.125
Goodman's cut--
18,000 from each.

41:39.467 --> 41:41.768
Legacy cost--

41:41.803 --> 41:44.104
$351,000.

41:44.139 --> 41:46.039
That's 117,000 each.

41:46.073 --> 41:47.506
"Legacy cost"?

41:47.541 --> 41:49.642
I got nine guys.

41:49.676 --> 41:52.645
You don't know them, but they were
part of the previous operation,

41:52.679 --> 41:54.047
and they know a lot.

41:54.081 --> 41:55.949
And right now,
some of them are in jail

41:55.983 --> 41:57.817
and more will be soon.

41:57.851 --> 42:00.086
The feds Rico-ed
their hazard pay,

42:00.120 --> 42:03.288
so <i>we</i> are gonna make 'em whole.

42:03.323 --> 42:06.291
<i>"We</i> are gonna make them whole"?

42:06.326 --> 42:08.293
What is this "we"?

42:08.328 --> 42:10.662
These were Gus's employees,
not ours.

42:10.696 --> 42:12.931
They might have been
Gus's employees,

42:12.966 --> 42:15.100
but they're my guys.

42:15.134 --> 42:19.131
So what are they doing
to further our interests?

42:19.710 --> 42:22.385
The cops are looking
at them very closely.

42:22.420 --> 42:25.710
We don't want them
furthering our interests.

42:25.744 --> 42:29.814
So we are paying them, why?

42:29.849 --> 42:33.984
Because it's what you do.

42:34.018 --> 42:35.853
Ohh.

42:35.887 --> 42:38.288
It's what you do.

42:39.290 --> 42:40.591
[Chuckles]

42:40.625 --> 42:43.594
My guys are keeping
their mouths shut.

42:43.628 --> 42:45.529
We make 'em whole.

42:45.563 --> 42:48.298
One hand washes the other.
It's as simple as that.

42:48.332 --> 42:49.799
Huh.

42:49.833 --> 42:52.067
It sounds like
a simple shakedown,

42:52.102 --> 42:54.069
simple as that.

42:54.104 --> 42:56.005
We're paying for their silence.

42:56.039 --> 42:57.940
That's blackmail.

42:59.075 --> 43:02.277
Business is my end.

43:02.312 --> 43:04.747
This is business.
End of story.

43:07.049 --> 43:09.083
This is your problem.

43:09.118 --> 43:11.019
It should come out of your end.

43:11.053 --> 43:13.622
Hey. Hey.
Just take it out of mine.

43:14.624 --> 43:17.559
All right?
Go for it.

43:17.593 --> 43:20.695
I don't care.
Just take it.

43:29.596 --> 43:30.629
No...

43:30.630 --> 43:32.130
Jesse, thank you,

43:32.273 --> 43:34.174
but... no.

43:34.208 --> 43:35.876
I'll pay my share.

43:37.012 --> 43:38.845
Go ahead.

43:42.683 --> 43:44.717
[Sighs]

43:44.718 --> 43:46.605
Let me tell you something.

43:48.455 --> 43:50.857
This...

43:50.891 --> 43:52.892
is how it's gonna be

43:52.927 --> 43:55.894
from here on out.

43:55.929 --> 44:00.265
My guys are ongoing expenditure

44:00.299 --> 44:04.402
so you best get yourself
comfortable with it.

44:13.845 --> 44:16.647
137,000.

44:17.683 --> 44:19.316
[Laughs]

44:19.350 --> 44:21.786
That's less than with Fring.

44:22.788 --> 44:24.254
Listen, Walter.

44:24.289 --> 44:27.323
Just because
you shot Jesse James...

44:28.325 --> 44:30.660
don't make you Jesse James.

44:38.335 --> 44:39.688
[Mike] Tomorrow.

44:55.452 --> 44:57.286
So how are you feeling?

44:57.321 --> 44:59.154
Okay, I guess.

45:01.324 --> 45:03.992
Broke it off with Andrea.

45:04.026 --> 45:05.827
I had to.

45:05.861 --> 45:10.499
She's gonna tell Brock.

45:10.533 --> 45:13.001
I'm still gonna take care
of the rent and stuff.

45:13.035 --> 45:15.002
It's the right thing to do,
but, you know--

45:15.036 --> 45:16.737
I meant this.

45:16.771 --> 45:19.473
How are you feeling
about the money?

45:19.508 --> 45:21.575
You're looking at it wrong.

45:21.610 --> 45:23.244
When we worked for Gus,

45:23.278 --> 45:25.546
we were cooking
200 pounds a week.

45:25.580 --> 45:28.081
This last batch was great,

45:28.116 --> 45:30.483
but we didn't even
crack 50 pounds.

45:30.518 --> 45:34.086
We maybe cleared less money, but
we got a bigger piece of the pie.

45:34.121 --> 45:37.957
It's like you said,
now we're owners,

45:37.991 --> 45:39.925
not employees.

45:43.063 --> 45:46.231
I've been thinking
about Victor.

45:46.266 --> 45:47.999
Yeah?

45:48.034 --> 45:52.771
Yeah. All this time

45:52.805 --> 45:56.007
I was sure that
Gus did what he did

45:56.042 --> 45:58.043
to send me a message.

46:00.180 --> 46:03.314
Maybe there's another reason.

46:03.348 --> 46:05.216
Like what?

46:07.752 --> 46:10.787
Victor trying to cook
that batch on his own?

46:10.821 --> 46:13.623
Taking liberties
that weren't his to take?

46:15.226 --> 46:19.196
Maybe he flew
too close to the sun,

46:19.230 --> 46:21.364
got his throat cut.

46:26.837 --> 46:28.604
[Mutters]

46:40.517 --> 46:42.517
[Metal door whirring]
