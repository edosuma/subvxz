to investigate? No.

Hell, no.

12:10.645 --> 12:12.846

three, four houses a week?

12:23.190 --> 12:24.824

it's a part of you, and...

27:57.416 --> 28:01.018
I mean, if you choose to spend the
rest of your life with this person,

28:02.921 --> 28:05.122
then you'll have to decide

28:05.156 --> 28:08.693
how much you'll share with her.

28:08.727 --> 28:12.930
Meaning what?
Like... everything?

28:15.265 --> 28:17.434
Like Gale?

28:24.208 --> 28:27.377
I'm just trying to say
that I trust you,

28:27.411 --> 28:31.313
and I know you'll make
the right call.

28:40.223 --> 28:42.691
If she loves you,

28:42.726 --> 28:44.760
she'll understand.

28:44.794 --> 28:47.829
[TV sound audible]

28:47.863 --> 28:50.665
They're leaving streaks.

28:50.699 --> 28:53.334
This more ethnic-looking one--
he's doing a great job.

28:53.369 --> 28:55.670
But the other one
is going back and forth

28:55.704 --> 28:57.438
like he's scrubbing a wall.

28:58.474 --> 29:01.242
They have to go in circles,

29:01.276 --> 29:03.677
or you're going
to leave streaks.

29:03.711 --> 29:06.413
That's pretty basic, right?

29:06.447 --> 29:09.649
Uh, I don't mean
to tell you your business.

29:09.684 --> 29:11.017
It's just-- it's--

29:11.051 --> 29:13.854
it's simple quality control.

29:16.624 --> 29:20.959
So, I've got some good news.

29:20.994 --> 29:22.495
Guess what.

29:22.529 --> 29:24.497
What?

29:24.531 --> 29:27.533
No, really.
I want you to guess.

29:28.703 --> 29:30.403
- Really, I really...
- Okay.

29:30.404 --> 29:31.871
Hank's back at work.

29:31.905 --> 29:34.606
- That's wonderful.
- Yeah.

29:34.640 --> 29:37.442
Sure, they love him now, but where
were they when he needed them?

29:37.476 --> 29:40.845
Merkert and all the rest-- they just
about laughed him out of the office

29:40.880 --> 29:44.616
when he told them about
that-- that chicken man.

29:44.650 --> 29:47.452
As far as I'm concerned,
too little too late.

29:47.486 --> 29:49.888
If it were me,
I'd tell them all to go to hell.

29:49.922 --> 29:52.656
Do I sound bitter?

29:52.690 --> 29:54.625
But it's--
it's what he wants, right?

29:54.659 --> 29:56.593
Yeah, it's doing him good.

29:56.628 --> 30:00.164
I mean, his PT
is going gangbusters.

30:00.198 --> 30:02.099
He's hardly using
his cane at all.

30:02.134 --> 30:05.269
And thank you for that, really.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.738
I mean, God knows where he'd be

30:07.772 --> 30:10.641
if we had to go through
his health plan.

30:10.675 --> 30:12.643
I'm just glad
he's feeling better.

30:12.677 --> 30:14.645
So, speaking of which,

30:14.679 --> 30:16.379
we have another
big event coming up.

30:16.414 --> 30:19.382
Have you thought about
what you're gonna do?

30:19.417 --> 30:21.384
Walt's birthday.

30:21.419 --> 30:23.986
Whatever you need, I'm here.

30:24.020 --> 30:26.656
Mm, yeah. I, um...

30:26.690 --> 30:29.058
I don't think we're gonna
do anything this year.

30:29.092 --> 30:30.559
What are you talking about?

30:30.593 --> 30:33.228
Of course we're
gonna do something.

30:33.263 --> 30:36.832
Skyler, he was diagnosed
around his birthday, right?

30:36.866 --> 30:38.500
I...

30:38.534 --> 30:40.502
So it's been a whole year.

30:40.536 --> 30:42.938
Listen, I've had
my problems with Walt.

30:42.973 --> 30:45.373
Why he wouldn't come to the house
when we were all practically beg--

30:45.407 --> 30:47.442
Whatever.
Water under the bridge.

30:47.476 --> 30:50.078
But at this point, every
year is precious. We are--

30:50.112 --> 30:51.712
What are you doing?

30:53.849 --> 30:55.549
You don't smoke.

30:55.550 --> 30:56.584
You haven't smoked
since college.

30:56.618 --> 30:58.453
You can't be serious!

30:58.487 --> 31:01.254
With the baby and Walt?

31:01.289 --> 31:03.290
Skyler, you're not smoking
around the baby, are you?

31:03.324 --> 31:04.958
And you can't smoke here.

31:04.993 --> 31:07.848
There's gotta be some rule
or regulation, I'm sure.

31:07.975 --> 31:10.612
You can't force your
employees to breathe--

31:10.647 --> 31:12.299
I know for a fact
that that is illegal.

31:12.333 --> 31:14.368
Marie, shut up.

31:14.402 --> 31:16.035
What?

31:16.069 --> 31:18.404
I'm sorry. Please don't
speak to me like that.

31:18.438 --> 31:20.306
- I am simply saying that you--
- Will you shut up?

31:20.340 --> 31:22.975
- Hey--
- Shut the hell up.

31:23.010 --> 31:25.444
- Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
- Skyler...

31:25.479 --> 31:27.579
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Please stop--

31:27.614 --> 31:30.282
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

31:30.317 --> 31:32.417
Shut up! Shut up!

31:32.451 --> 31:34.585
Shut up!

31:37.490 --> 31:40.925
[Crying]

31:45.276 --> 31:46.442
[Jesse]
That's a 5.23.

31:46.477 --> 31:48.778
[Walt]
5.23.

31:49.947 --> 31:51.081
Last one.

31:51.115 --> 31:52.815
[Scale beeps]

31:52.850 --> 31:55.285
5.26.

31:55.319 --> 31:57.387
5.26.

31:57.421 --> 32:02.958
That comes to 49.27.

32:02.993 --> 32:05.060
Good yield, right?

32:05.095 --> 32:08.330
That is an excellent yield.

32:09.832 --> 32:14.603
All right.

32:14.637 --> 32:16.638
[Gas hissing]

32:38.192 --> 32:46.166
[Car door closes]

32:46.200 --> 32:48.135
[Door opens]

32:49.403 --> 32:50.970
Hey Marie.

32:53.440 --> 32:55.441
How you doing?

32:59.446 --> 33:00.913
Where is Skyler?

33:00.948 --> 33:02.481
In the bedroom.
She's resting.

33:03.783 --> 33:06.117
Is everything okay?

33:06.152 --> 33:08.288
Breakdown? What does that--
what does that mean?

33:08.403 --> 33:10.284
It means I don't know
what else to call it.

33:10.490 --> 33:13.826
But I've never seen her
like that, ever.

33:14.894 --> 33:18.497
Well, what did she say
when she was yelling?

33:18.531 --> 33:19.565
Nothing.

33:19.599 --> 33:24.301
She just yelled, "Shut up, shut up,"
over and over again.

33:24.336 --> 33:26.170
Did you know she's smoking?

33:26.204 --> 33:28.105
Occasionally, maybe.

33:28.139 --> 33:31.141
It's not a regular thing.

33:31.176 --> 33:33.845
Oh, I just wish
I had gotten your message.

33:33.879 --> 33:35.746
"Messages," Walt.

33:35.781 --> 33:39.048
Plural. I probably
called you five times.

33:39.083 --> 33:40.917
[Mutters]

33:43.387 --> 33:46.155
I'm not leaving here until I
know what's got her so upset.

33:48.425 --> 33:53.329
Are you gambling again?
Is that what this is?

33:53.364 --> 33:55.731
Please, God, tell me
the cancer isn't back.

33:56.766 --> 34:00.569
No. It's not the cancer.

34:00.604 --> 34:02.170
Well, something happened.

34:02.205 --> 34:08.010
I don't mean to point the finger,
but this didn't just come out of nowhere.

34:08.043 --> 34:10.277
It's time to tell me
the truth, Walt. All of it.

34:11.514 --> 34:13.514
I mean it.

34:14.817 --> 34:16.684
You're right.

34:21.524 --> 34:23.925
[Sighs]

34:23.958 --> 34:26.092
You heard about Ted Beneke?

34:26.127 --> 34:28.094
The accident?

34:28.129 --> 34:29.862
What accident?

34:29.898 --> 34:31.864
Oh...

34:31.900 --> 34:33.967
Um...

34:34.002 --> 34:36.402
A couple weeks back,

34:36.437 --> 34:39.239
Ted took a fall--
a bad one.

34:39.273 --> 34:41.306
He gave himself a concussion,

34:41.342 --> 34:43.943
and, uh, fractured
a couple vertebrae.

34:43.976 --> 34:46.110
He's still in the hospital.

34:46.146 --> 34:48.047
He may never walk again.

34:48.081 --> 34:50.349
Oh, my God.
I-- I didn't--

34:50.382 --> 34:52.752
I didn't know.
I'm so sorry to hear that.

34:52.786 --> 34:54.485
Yeah.

34:55.656 --> 34:59.323
But that couldn't explain...
Skyler's--

34:59.358 --> 35:04.563
Uh... Yes.
Yes, it could.

35:10.069 --> 35:12.136
You do know, right?
You...

35:12.171 --> 35:14.504
You must know.

35:17.341 --> 35:19.109
Oh, God.

35:21.279 --> 35:23.814
She was having an affair...

35:23.848 --> 35:25.816
with Ted Beneke?

35:25.850 --> 35:28.185
Listen, listen.
It wasn't--

35:28.219 --> 35:30.486
it-- it wasn't...

35:30.520 --> 35:33.690
ongoing or anything, and...

35:35.759 --> 35:37.727
Well, Skyler and I
have been trying

35:37.761 --> 35:40.262
to put things back together.

35:40.297 --> 35:46.367
And then-- then the accident
happened, and she got...

35:48.905 --> 35:50.472
Marie, I'm begging you.

35:50.506 --> 35:51.974
Please, keep this to yourself.

35:52.008 --> 35:54.209
I don't want Hank
to think less of her...

35:54.243 --> 35:55.911
or me.

35:58.748 --> 36:01.182
When did you, um...

36:03.284 --> 36:05.620
Was she--
I'm gonna go.

36:05.654 --> 36:08.221
Okay. All right.

36:13.961 --> 36:15.929
[Sighs]

36:21.969 --> 36:23.469
[Mutters]

36:30.944 --> 36:32.410

Ahh!

39:11.161 --> 39:13.061
Okay.

39:13.096 --> 39:17.266
For you and you and me.
367,000 dollars each.

39:17.301 --> 39:20.235
Ooh. Wait a minute.

39:20.270 --> 39:22.771
After the dealers
got their cut,

39:22.805 --> 39:28.710
we should be looking
at 1,379,560.

39:28.711 --> 39:31.211
Mike, you're short.

39:31.314 --> 39:33.648
You're almost 300,000 short.

39:33.683 --> 39:35.317
You're forgetting
about the mules.

39:35.351 --> 39:36.984
They get a flat 20%.

39:37.019 --> 39:38.652
- The what?
- The drivers.

39:38.687 --> 39:42.023
They're the ones that take the
product from us to the dealers.

39:43.091 --> 39:47.695
And so, transportation
is worth 20%?

39:47.729 --> 39:49.864
They are taking a risk.

39:51.266 --> 39:55.702
$275,000 worth of risk?

39:55.736 --> 39:58.872
Wow.

39:58.906 --> 40:01.141
What did Gus pay his mules?

40:01.175 --> 40:03.977
Gustavo Fring didn't use mules.

40:04.011 --> 40:05.478
He didn't need them.

40:05.512 --> 40:08.348
He spent 20 years
building his own distribution.

40:08.382 --> 40:12.064
He had 16 refrigerator trucks
running his product.

40:12.352 --> 40:13.937
And you know
where they are now?

40:13.972 --> 40:16.355
Government impound.

40:16.389 --> 40:19.358
You don't like paying 20%?
Maybe you shouldn't have killed the guy.

Hey, hey, hey.

40:20.626 --> 40:22.928
There's still over
a million bucks here, all right?

40:22.963 --> 40:24.696
That's for one cook.

40:24.731 --> 40:27.531
And since you're putting on
the green eyeshade,

40:27.566 --> 40:29.533
my supplier and I
came to an agreement.

40:29.568 --> 40:31.769
The methylamine
was free this time.

40:31.803 --> 40:33.271
But brace yourself,

40:33.305 --> 40:36.140
because the next barrel
is gonna cost big.

40:37.609 --> 40:40.745
Can we continue, or you got
anymore burning questions?

[No audible dialogue]

40:44.282 --> 40:45.749
Okay, kid.

40:45.783 --> 40:49.419
You fronted us 120,000
to get us going.

40:49.453 --> 40:56.559
So that's 40,000
from him and me.

40:56.594 --> 40:58.827
Yes. Thank you, Jesse.

40:58.862 --> 41:00.096
Okay.

41:00.130 --> 41:04.633
Now, Ira gets 110,000
for our piece of the business

41:04.667 --> 41:07.303
and 25,000 per cook.

41:07.337 --> 41:09.372
That is 45,000...

41:10.374 --> 41:12.674
from each of us.

41:17.846 --> 41:21.449
Ira's guys get
10,000 each per cook.

41:27.456 --> 41:31.125
Goodman's cut--
18,000 from each.

41:39.467 --> 41:41.768
Legacy cost--

41:41.803 --> 41:44.104
$351,000.

41:44.139 --> 41:46.039
That's 117,000 each.

41:46.073 --> 41:47.506
"Legacy cost"?

41:47.541 --> 41:49.642
I got nine guys.

41:49.676 --> 41:52.645
You don't know them, but they were
part of the previous operation,

41:52.679 --> 41:54.047
and they know a lot.

41:54.081 --> 41:55.949
And right now,
some of them are in jail

41:55.983 --> 41:57.817
and more will be soon.

41:57.851 --> 42:00.086
The feds Rico-ed
their hazard pay,

42:00.120 --> 42:03.288
so <i>we</i> are gonna make 'em whole.

42:03.323 --> 42:06.291
<i>"We</i> are gonna make them whole"?

42:06.326 --> 42:08.293
What is this "we"?

42:08.328 --> 42:10.662
These were Gus's employees,
not ours.

42:10.696 --> 42:12.931
They might have been
Gus's employees,

42:12.966 --> 42:15.100
but they're my guys.

42:15.134 --> 42:19.131
So what are they doing
to further our interests?

42:19.710 --> 42:22.385
The cops are looking
at them very closely.

42:22.420 --> 42:25.710
We don't want them
furthering our interests.

42:25.744 --> 42:29.814
So we are paying them, why?

42:29.849 --> 42:33.984
Because it's what you do.

42:34.018 --> 42:35.853
Ohh.

42:35.887 --> 42:38.288
It's what you do.

42:39.290 --> 42:40.591
[Chuckles]

42:40.625 --> 42:43.594
My guys are keeping
their mouths shut.

42:43.628 --> 42:45.529
We make 'em whole.

42:45.563 --> 42:48.298
One hand washes the other.
It's as simple as that.

42:48.332 --> 42:49.799
Huh.

42:49.833 --> 42:52.067
It sounds like
a simple shakedown,

42:52.102 --> 42:54.069
simple as that.

42:54.104 --> 42:56.005
We're paying for their silence.

42:56.039 --> 42:57.940
That's blackmail.

42:59.075 --> 43:02.277
Business is my end.

43:02.312 --> 43:04.747
This is business.
End of story.

43:07.049 --> 43:09.083
This is your problem.

43:09.118 --> 43:11.019
It should come out of your end.

43:11.053 --> 43:13.622
Hey. Hey.
Just take it out of mine.

43:14.624 --> 43:17.559
All right?
Go for it.

43:17.593 --> 43:20.695
I don't care.
Just take it.

43:29.596 --> 43:30.629
No...

43:30.630 --> 43:32.130
Jesse, thank you,

43:32.273 --> 43:34.174
but... no.

43:34.208 --> 43:35.876
I'll pay my share.

43:37.012 --> 43:38.845
Go ahead.

43:42.683 --> 43:44.717
[Sighs]

43:44.718 --> 43:46.605
Let me tell you something.

43:48.455 --> 43:50.857
This...

43:50.891 --> 43:52.892
is how it's gonna be

43:52.927 --> 43:55.894
from here on out.

43:55.929 --> 44:00.265
My guys are ongoing expenditure

44:00.299 --> 44:04.402
so you best get yourself
comfortable with it.

44:13.845 --> 44:16.647
137,000.

44:17.683 --> 44:19.316
[Laughs]

44:19.350 --> 44:21.786
That's less than with Fring.

44:22.788 --> 44:24.254
Listen, Walter.

44:24.289 --> 44:27.323
Just because
you shot Jesse James...

44:28.325 --> 44:30.660
don't make you Jesse James.

44:38.335 --> 44:39.688
[Mike] Tomorrow.

44:55.452 --> 44:57.286
So how are you feeling?

44:57.321 --> 44:59.154
Okay, I guess.

45:01.324 --> 45:03.992
Broke it off with Andrea.

45:04.026 --> 45:05.827
I had to.

45:05.861 --> 45:10.499
She's gonna tell Brock.

45:10.533 --> 45:13.001
I'm still gonna take care
of the rent and stuff.

45:13.035 --> 45:15.002
It's the right thing to do,
but, you know--

45:15.036 --> 45:16.737
I meant this.

45:16.771 --> 45:19.473
How are you feeling
about the money?

45:19.508 --> 45:21.575
You're looking at it wrong.

45:21.610 --> 45:23.244
When we worked for Gus,

45:23.278 --> 45:25.546
we were cooking
200 pounds a week.

45:25.580 --> 45:28.081
This last batch was great,

45:28.116 --> 45:30.483
but we didn't even
crack 50 pounds.

45:30.518 --> 45:34.086
We maybe cleared less money, but
we got a bigger piece of the pie.

45:34.121 --> 45:37.957
It's like you said,
now we're owners,

45:37.991 --> 45:39.925
not employees.

45:43.063 --> 45:46.231
I've been thinking
about Victor.

45:46.266 --> 45:47.999
Yeah?

45:48.034 --> 45:52.771
Yeah. All this time

45:52.805 --> 45:56.007
I was sure that
Gus did what he did

45:56.042 --> 45:58.043
to send me a message.

46:00.180 --> 46:03.314
Maybe there's another reason.

46:03.348 --> 46:05.216
Like what?

46:07.752 --> 46:10.787
Victor trying to cook
that batch on his own?

46:10.821 --> 46:13.623
Taking liberties
that weren't his to take?

46:15.226 --> 46:19.196
Maybe he flew
too close to the sun,

46:19.230 --> 46:21.364
got his throat cut.

46:26.837 --> 46:28.604
[Mutters]

46:40.517 --> 46:42.517
[Metal door whirring]
