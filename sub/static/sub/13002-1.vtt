<b> <i>RUST AND BONE</i> </b>

02:52.792 --> 02:54.750
I'm hungry.

02:57.250 --> 02:59.292
I'm hungry!

03:35.200 --> 03:36.361
Do you want?

03:46.520 --> 03:47.282
Stop!

03:49.560 --> 03:50.971
Stop, I said stop!

04:03.250 --> 04:05.125
Sam!

04:24.958 --> 04:28.583
These has better image quality.

04:28.750 --> 04:31.958
These are semi-professional cameras.
I'll show you something.

04:34.876 --> 04:36.751
This is the best quality.

04:37.167 --> 04:39.042
Hey, sir!

05:03.000 --> 05:05.333
Come on,
what are you doing?

05:09.209 --> 05:10.959
- Tired?
- No.

05:17.417 --> 05:18.834
- Are you Ali?
- Yes.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.650
Come on!

05:23.240 --> 05:24.969
You're late!

05:25.120 --> 05:26.884
I drove around for an hour!

05:27.040 --> 05:27.768
Move!

05:27.920 --> 05:30.321
I meant to call Anna,
I couldn't find you.

05:30.501 --> 05:32.501
- Do you like my truck?
- Yes.

05:32.667 --> 05:34.542
- Do you really like?
- Yes.

05:34.542 --> 05:38.458
I don't like those
who dislike my truck!

05:38.840 --> 05:40.649
- So, do you like it?
- Yes.

05:42.542 --> 05:44.292
You're a nice boy.

05:44.458 --> 05:48.833
Eight drivers on the road.
After some conversations with Anna ...

05:49.000 --> 05:52.458
I told myself that
I was going on my own.

05:52.625 --> 05:54.958
Then I bought this truck.

05:59.920 --> 06:01.331
What's that for?

06:01.520 --> 06:03.727
To eat outside,
when the weather is nice!

06:03.880 --> 06:06.167
There's too much sun here!

06:06.320 --> 06:08.766
I'm still waiting.

06:09.920 --> 06:10.843
Look!

06:11.920 --> 06:13.410
Look!

06:16.583 --> 06:20.125
You see the dogs?
Those are Aunt Anna's.

06:22.320 --> 06:24.049
Who owns those car parts?

06:24.200 --> 06:25.964
Neighbor Che's.

06:26.120 --> 06:29.044
He who moonlights with this.

06:29.708 --> 06:31.625
Very handy.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.764
Say when stop.

06:42.560 --> 06:44.050
With this you become a big boy.

06:44.200 --> 06:47.044
How long haven't you seen Anna?

06:47.200 --> 06:49.362
- I don't know, five years.
- Long time!

06:50.708 --> 06:54.042
- Where does she work?
- In a supermarket.

06:54.208 --> 06:57.208
- What? She is a cashier?
- Yeah. Exactly.

07:00.667 --> 07:05.125
No, from the top stack.
Most are expired.

07:05.292 --> 07:08.000
They are arranged by date,
from top to bottom.

07:08.120 --> 07:10.248
- I grab one here?
- Yeah, above.

07:10.400 --> 07:11.686
- Do you want?
- No.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.125
Anna takes them home from work.

07:16.280 --> 07:19.170
As soon as the date has passed,
they are discarded.

07:19.320 --> 07:22.324
They can be eaten
for at least one week.

07:23.440 --> 07:25.249
Do you earn well?

07:25.400 --> 07:26.765
Listen...

07:26.920 --> 07:29.810
What can I say ...
We can pay our bills.

07:29.960 --> 07:32.611
- What exactly do you do?
- Deliveries. Frozen products.

07:32.760 --> 07:36.207
Fish in general,
but I can do other products.

07:36.360 --> 07:38.727
That depends on the offer.

07:39.458 --> 07:41.917
More coffee?

07:42.083 --> 07:44.167
Yeah, it's great!

08:04.917 --> 08:07.042
He looks like you.

08:12.250 --> 08:15.458
Is that all?
You won't give your brother a kiss?

08:15.640 --> 08:16.721
Hum...

08:17.250 --> 08:19.042
Are you okay?

08:22.440 --> 08:24.044
That's all you got?

08:24.200 --> 08:26.567
At least
she left his passport.

08:26.833 --> 08:29.750
She forgot it was there.

08:29.917 --> 08:32.974
When they went to Amsterdam,
they used the kid to smuggle dope.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.520
Are you kidding?

08:34.679 --> 08:36.761
That's what she told me.

08:36.919 --> 08:38.409
Well...

08:38.600 --> 08:42.126
How will you take care of him?
Because Richard and I don't have time.

08:42.280 --> 08:45.284
He went to school, at least?

08:45.375 --> 08:48.250
Don't you know if your son
went to school?

08:48.520 --> 08:51.091
Sam! you went to school
at your mom's?

08:51.240 --> 08:52.526
Yes!

08:52.680 --> 08:56.241
I'll try to enroll him at the school.
We also need to get him some clothes.

08:56.400 --> 09:00.246
He can't go like that.
I'll check with the neighbors.

09:03.640 --> 09:05.005
- Shall I wake you in an hour?
- Yes.

09:05.160 --> 09:06.366
I close the door?

09:06.560 --> 09:08.562
- No, it's okay.
- It's okay?

09:11.240 --> 09:13.925
- Can I have a cake?
- Do you want?

09:14.080 --> 09:16.367
- Yes.
- Okay.

09:17.960 --> 09:19.564
- Here, you.

09:19.720 --> 09:21.802
Here! Here!

09:23.360 --> 09:25.203
Here, this one too!

09:26.440 --> 09:27.646
Do you watch them?

09:28.920 --> 09:30.410
Don't hurt them!

09:30.600 --> 09:33.365
- Oops...
- Be careful so they can't run away.

09:42.208 --> 09:44.625
Won't you eat?

09:44.792 --> 09:47.929
- They are beautiful, huh?
- Yeah.

09:48.333 --> 09:50.333
I got them from a breeder.

09:50.500 --> 09:55.333
In a month he takes them
to a shelter.

09:55.500 --> 09:58.375
- Are you okay?
- I'm exhausted, but...

10:01.708 --> 10:04.500
- It doesn't work anymore!
- Wait and you will see!

10:04.600 --> 10:06.887
Looks can be deceiving sometimes.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.849
To go to your work.

10:09.292 --> 10:12.500
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

10:12.920 --> 10:14.888
Che! Che!

10:15.040 --> 10:17.407
- Yes?
- Where is the toolbox?

10:17.600 --> 10:19.568
- In the garage.
- There?

10:19.720 --> 10:21.688
Can you help us?

10:37.840 --> 10:39.683
Stop it, stop it!

10:39.840 --> 10:41.285
Oh!

10:41.440 --> 10:43.681
Will you stop
with this mess?

10:57.458 --> 11:00.750
- When is Mommy coming?
- Soon.

11:00.917 --> 11:02.708
Soon...

11:03.750 --> 11:07.167
- When is Mommy coming?
- Soon, I told you!

11:09.458 --> 11:12.500
- When?
- I don't know.

11:16.720 --> 11:18.848
Where did you work
for the last time?

11:19.000 --> 11:21.844
In a slaughterhouse,
but was closed down.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.764
Do you never worked
as a security guard?

11:24.240 --> 11:27.687
Yeah, I worked in a stadium
for six months.

11:28.360 --> 11:31.091
As a night watchman.
And in a parking garage.

11:31.240 --> 11:33.527
Have you done martial arts?

11:33.680 --> 11:37.447
Boxing for 6 years.
And two years of Thai boxing.

11:39.667 --> 11:43.708
Can you prove it?
With photos or a license?

11:43.875 --> 11:47.417
I won a regional title
in Belgium.

11:47.583 --> 11:49.125
I have a belt...

11:50.250 --> 11:53.625
- Have you stopped?
- No, my trainer has stopped.

11:53.792 --> 11:55.792
- Why?
- He died.

11:57.375 --> 12:00.167
- Do you smoke?
- No.

12:00.333 --> 12:02.750
Do you drink?

12:04.083 --> 12:06.583
- I didn't hear anything.
- No, I don't drink.

12:06.750 --> 12:09.167
- Do you take drugs?
- No.

12:09.320 --> 12:11.209
Give me a reason to hire you.

12:14.667 --> 12:16.792
Trust me.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.002
Oh that's right.
And what is this?

12:20.160 --> 12:22.242
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

12:23.667 --> 12:25.376
- So?
- Sam, come here.

12:25.542 --> 12:28.751
I would say within a week.
Is that his son?

12:28.917 --> 12:31.167
You didn't say
you had a child?

12:31.334 --> 12:32.917
I didn't ask him.

12:34.417 --> 12:36.084
Did you hear
from that customer?

12:36.251 --> 12:37.292
You have cold hands.

12:37.459 --> 12:39.251
Good evening.

12:39.417 --> 12:41.542
Good evening.

12:41.709 --> 12:43.834
Good evening.

12:44.001 --> 12:46.834
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

12:47.001 --> 12:49.084
- Good evening!
- Go ahead, girls.

12:49.251 --> 12:52.376
- Four against one, I am no match.
- Good evening.

12:57.400 --> 13:01.450
You see? It's easy.
You say what you want.

13:01.626 --> 13:02.834
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.368
When they leave, they remember you,
if they are drunk ...

13:06.460 --> 13:09.291
And had a shitty night, you're there
with a nice thing to say!

13:09.459 --> 13:10.709
- Does it work?
- Of course!

13:27.167 --> 13:28.542
Get out!

13:33.251 --> 13:35.376
Oh, okay! Get out!
Please.

13:35.542 --> 13:36.709
Get out!

13:44.126 --> 13:46.667
Are you OK?
Keep your head back.

13:46.708 --> 13:49.958
Good. Breathe slowly.

13:51.209 --> 13:52.959
Asshole!

13:54.001 --> 13:56.251
Breathe.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.209
I have to go home.

13:58.360 --> 14:00.169
Do you have friends here?

14:00.320 --> 14:03.324
No, it's okay,
I'm alone, I have my car.

14:03.501 --> 14:05.584
- You can't drive like that.
- Yes. I'm fine.

14:05.751 --> 14:08.209
- No, I'll call you a cab.
- No, I have my car.

14:08.376 --> 14:10.876
I'm fine already. Thanks.
You're sweet.

14:11.040 --> 14:13.122
- Slut!
- Yeah, you, bitch!

14:13.292 --> 14:14.542
What is it?

14:14.709 --> 14:16.917
- Bitch!
- Hey, shut up!

14:17.084 --> 14:18.959
Shit.

14:20.417 --> 14:22.167
It's still bleeding?

14:22.334 --> 14:24.084
No, I'm fine.

14:25.917 --> 14:27.334
Shit.

14:29.334 --> 14:30.959
Did you get hurt?

14:31.126 --> 14:34.001
Yes, it's starting to swell.
Look.

14:43.167 --> 14:45.417
You go to the Annexe often?

14:46.150 --> 14:47.142
No.

14:48.126 --> 14:49.917
Why do you come alone?

14:51.584 --> 14:53.417
To dance?

14:54.917 --> 14:56.334
Yes.

14:56.501 --> 14:58.042
To find a guy?

14:58.834 --> 15:00.251
Oh, really?

15:01.876 --> 15:04.334
You don't dress like that
just to dance.

15:04.917 --> 15:06.459
How am I dressed?

15:07.459 --> 15:09.084
I don't know ...

15:09.880 --> 15:10.847
Look!

15:11.000 --> 15:13.207
Yeah? So what?

15:16.708 --> 15:19.333
You're dressed like ...
a whore.

15:21.042 --> 15:22.875
Excuse me?

15:23.792 --> 15:26.209
- Are you dressed like what?
- That's enough.

15:28.250 --> 15:31.750
- It's no surprise that the guys ...
- Shut up.

15:36.083 --> 15:39.458
- How do you get back?
- I don't know.

15:39.680 --> 15:41.250
Forget it, I'm fine.

15:41.417 --> 15:44.417
- For the taxi.
- I'm fine. Here.

15:44.584 --> 15:45.834
Well, goodnight.

15:46.640 --> 15:49.644
- Do you have some ice?
- What?

15:49.800 --> 15:51.723
Ice cubes.

15:51.880 --> 15:54.281
Wait here, I'll see.

15:54.440 --> 15:56.966
- Can I come along?
- No.

15:57.417 --> 16:00.042
- There's someone upstairs.
- So what?

16:00.208 --> 16:03.042
Wait here. I'll be right back.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.875
Okay.

16:09.209 --> 16:10.626
Come.

16:16.250 --> 16:19.667
- Steph?
- There's ice here.

16:19.833 --> 16:22.083
What happens to you?

16:22.280 --> 16:24.521
- There was a fight.
- Are you okay?

16:24.680 --> 16:27.081
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Good evening.

16:27.240 --> 16:28.765
Who is he?

16:28.920 --> 16:31.161
The bouncer from the the Annexe.
He brought me home.

16:31.334 --> 16:33.542
The Annexe?
What were you doing there?

16:34.360 --> 16:36.044
What are you doing?

16:36.200 --> 16:38.680
- I'm packing ice.
- He hurt his hand.

16:39.958 --> 16:42.375
Can we talk for a minute?

16:42.667 --> 16:43.834
<i>Hein?</i>

17:00.959 --> 17:05.003
<i>I was waiting like an idiot!
Let me know, this is the least!</i>

17:10.200 --> 17:11.565
<i>Stop bugging me!</i>

17:11.720 --> 17:14.369
<i>- What...?
- Stop bugging me!</i>

17:16.958 --> 17:19.541
- Is it better?
- Yeah, it is.

17:22.359 --> 17:24.931
Is that you in the photos
with the orcas?

17:25.084 --> 17:26.291
Yes.

17:26.440 --> 17:28.602
- Is it your job?
- Yes.

17:30.126 --> 17:32.384
I'd never have imagined!

17:32.451 --> 17:35.001
Why? Can't a whore train orcas?

17:37.542 --> 17:38.417
Great...

17:39.250 --> 17:41.792
Aren't you gone yet?

17:42.875 --> 17:45.125
Are you talking to me?

17:48.417 --> 17:49.875
Go on, please.

17:52.625 --> 17:55.792
Here is my number,
just in case.

18:08.042 --> 18:10.709
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

18:13.292 --> 18:15.333
Are you sulking?

18:15.500 --> 18:17.208
No.

18:20.458 --> 18:24.500
- I saw your face just now.
- Just now?

18:24.667 --> 18:27.833
With that guy from the Annexe.

18:28.160 --> 18:30.083
I saw how you piped down.

18:30.240 --> 18:31.924
I piped down? Me?

18:32.080 --> 18:34.321
- Yeah, you piped down.
- Ah...

18:34.875 --> 18:37.458
You aren't
commanding me anymore, Simon.

18:37.667 --> 18:39.542
What do you mean?

18:40.167 --> 18:42.501
You don't give me commands anymore.
That's all.

19:22.501 --> 19:26.459
Okay? Duncan, you start
by the reverences.

19:26.626 --> 19:28.501
We make the challenge
and a Spy Up.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.667
You start the reverences.

20:22.084 --> 20:25.251
I'll make a slide!
OK!

21:40.876 --> 21:42.834
We send the reverence!

21:59.875 --> 22:01.917
Watch out!
Steph!

23:08.360 --> 23:10.607
Sam, Get out of it.
It's disgusting.

23:15.542 --> 23:17.417
Get out of it, it's disgusting!

23:19.360 --> 23:20.521
Oh!

23:29.400 --> 23:30.811
Get out of it!

23:31.640 --> 23:32.971
Hey!

23:33.126 --> 23:36.084
Come!
Come, shit!

23:36.251 --> 23:37.501
It's disgusting!

23:39.084 --> 23:40.376
Don't touch me!

23:40.542 --> 23:42.459
Walk!
Anna!

23:43.376 --> 23:44.292
Off those pants.

23:44.459 --> 23:46.001
Off those pants, I said.

23:46.167 --> 23:48.459
You smell like shit!

23:48.626 --> 23:50.542
Up your arms! Go!

23:51.376 --> 23:53.917
Come here. Come here!

23:59.709 --> 24:02.042
Come, stay here!

24:03.250 --> 24:06.000
- What are you doing?
- Did you watch him?

24:06.200 --> 24:07.440
Yeah, I just hung the laundry.

24:07.626 --> 24:09.209
What have you done?

24:10.000 --> 24:11.249
Don't cry! Don't cry!

24:11.417 --> 24:13.376
- Stop with that.
- Where's my sister?

24:13.542 --> 24:15.001
She's gone.
The truck had a breakdown.

24:15.167 --> 24:17.167
- Look at that.
- Come, I'll wash you.

24:19.400 --> 24:20.925
Don't go back there anymore!

25:08.750 --> 25:10.917
Is anyone there?

25:51.500 --> 25:53.000
Steph ...

25:54.167 --> 25:55.917
Wait, wait.

25:58.417 --> 26:01.250
What happened to my legs?

26:02.958 --> 26:05.625
What happened to my legs?

26:14.208 --> 26:19.417
What happened to my legs?

27:50.292 --> 27:53.167
I got your brothers on the phone.

27:53.333 --> 27:57.458
They want to talk to you
but this is not the time.

27:58.625 --> 28:01.625
Hugo is coming the next holiday.

28:04.042 --> 28:07.376
I told myself that
I might lose you.

28:07.542 --> 28:10.001
I don't know what I would have done.

28:15.042 --> 28:16.417
I will pray for you.

28:17.376 --> 28:18.834
I passed by your house.

28:19.001 --> 28:23.084
I saw the housekeeper,
she didn't want me to pay her.

28:23.251 --> 28:25.792
She is very upset.

28:51.958 --> 28:54.167
Give me that.

28:54.333 --> 28:56.375
Give me that
immediately.

28:58.167 --> 29:00.834
Please.

29:01.500 --> 29:04.000
What do you want with it?

29:58.240 --> 29:59.924
I'll take you.

30:00.080 --> 30:02.162
- I'll take you for a walk.
- No.

30:02.320 --> 30:04.402
- Just a litte?
- No, I don't want.

30:15.001 --> 30:15.959
Right!

30:16.126 --> 30:17.126
Right!

30:17.250 --> 30:19.167
Very good.
Left!

30:19.333 --> 30:21.125
Left, right!

30:22.840 --> 30:26.128
Here, here, here in the middle!

30:27.560 --> 30:28.721
Protect yourself!

30:28.880 --> 30:30.962
Right!

30:31.120 --> 30:32.963
Three!

30:40.400 --> 30:42.084
- You are too static.
- Yeah.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.004
How are you?

30:44.160 --> 30:45.810
- How are you Foued?
- Fine.

30:45.959 --> 30:47.876
- Good morning.
- Ali.

30:48.167 --> 30:49.792
See you soon!

31:13.334 --> 31:14.459
Everything alright?

31:34.083 --> 31:35.792
Wait a moment.

31:40.126 --> 31:41.376
Hello?

31:41.542 --> 31:44.667
<i>- You forgot Sam.</i>
- I'm still at the gym.

31:44.834 --> 31:47.751
<i>- You have to pick him up at school.</i>
- I'm going.

31:47.917 --> 31:50.501
<i>- Are you kidding me?</i>
- I'm going already!

32:10.625 --> 32:13.625
Mister van Versch,
can I talk to you for a moment?

32:15.440 --> 32:17.681
Sorry, ma'am.
I was still at work.

32:17.840 --> 32:19.683
- Have you seen the time?
- Yeah.

32:19.840 --> 32:21.285
This is the third time
in two weeks.

32:21.440 --> 32:24.171
The next time
I'll have to call the police.

32:24.320 --> 32:26.846
No, it's ok.
Sam, come here.

32:30.917 --> 32:33.459
- It's going to happen again?
- No, it's okay.

32:39.120 --> 32:40.849
Move on, shit!

32:41.001 --> 32:43.334
- It annoys me.
- Don't you like dogs?

32:43.501 --> 32:45.917
- No. Get out!
- He doesn't like acorns.

32:46.080 --> 32:48.924
- Move, move!
- What is it?

32:49.751 --> 32:51.584
And it stinks too!

33:08.960 --> 33:11.327
- Hello?
<i>- Hello?</i>

33:13.250 --> 33:17.667
<i>- It's Ali?</i>
- Yes, it's me. Who is it?

33:17.833 --> 33:19.917
<i>- Stéphanie.</i>
- Stéphanie?

33:20.440 --> 33:24.530
<i>We met at the Annexe.
The brawl, the ice ...</i>

33:24.620 --> 33:25.727
Yes, of course.
Stéphanie.

33:25.876 --> 33:27.834
How are you?

33:29.000 --> 33:31.002
<i>You know
what happened to me?</i>

33:31.160 --> 33:33.083
I saw it on TV, yes.

33:34.250 --> 33:37.333
<i>So how would I be,
what do you think?</i>

33:38.417 --> 33:40.375
I don’t know.

33:42.334 --> 33:44.209
<i>And you, everything ok?</i>

33:44.376 --> 33:46.292
Yes, normal.

33:47.459 --> 33:49.167
<i>Are you still a bouncer?</i>

33:49.334 --> 33:53.126
No, watchman,
four nights a week.

34:40.958 --> 34:43.042
I'm here...

34:49.833 --> 34:51.625
Come in.

34:55.375 --> 34:59.833
- Have you been here long?
- I just arrived.

35:00.000 --> 35:03.167
- Did you rang just now?
- No.

35:05.800 --> 35:06.767
Sit down.

35:11.240 --> 35:13.925
Want something to drink?
Coffee?

35:14.084 --> 35:15.626
Yes.

35:16.501 --> 35:18.876
- I only have "Nes".
- That's fine.

35:19.042 --> 35:21.376
- Do you want me to help you?
- No.

35:26.720 --> 35:28.882
Have you been living here long?

35:29.240 --> 35:31.811
Since ... Since...

35:32.560 --> 35:35.723
Two... three, four months,
I think.

35:36.640 --> 35:38.324
Nice place.

35:38.500 --> 35:41.250
It is temporary, because ...

35:41.417 --> 35:43.750
I'll do that.

35:43.917 --> 35:45.667
It's fine.

35:45.833 --> 35:49.042
The insurance pays.

35:49.208 --> 35:52.542
Do you have anyone to help you?

35:52.708 --> 35:55.583
What for? To walk?

35:55.750 --> 35:58.875
No, the household and all that.

35:59.042 --> 36:02.292
Yes, all kinds of people come along.

36:18.458 --> 36:20.292
Are you okay?

36:28.208 --> 36:30.042
Are you okay?

36:45.880 --> 36:47.564
Do you think it stinks?

36:48.120 --> 36:49.645
A little bit.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.002
I think I stinks.

36:57.792 --> 37:00.042
Come outside.

37:03.751 --> 37:05.126
No, no...

37:05.280 --> 37:08.011
- Yes, put this on.
- No, I don't want to.

37:08.160 --> 37:10.561
- Yeah, let's go outside.
- No, I don't want to!

37:23.542 --> 37:25.417
Wait, watch out.

37:30.626 --> 37:32.167
Watch out!

37:37.440 --> 37:39.841
No, don't push.
I feel sick.

37:41.040 --> 37:42.883
I'll do it.

38:39.792 --> 38:42.667
I feel like swimming.

38:43.875 --> 38:46.417
Don't you want?

38:47.750 --> 38:50.333
Why?
Don't you have a bathing suit?

38:54.160 --> 38:56.003
Do you realize
what you're saying?

38:56.160 --> 38:58.208
Why?
There's nobody here.

39:02.760 --> 39:04.649
Well... I'm going.

40:24.880 --> 40:26.928
I will go in now.

40:27.417 --> 40:28.709
Ah yeah?

40:31.000 --> 40:33.500
Can you give me that towel?

41:04.500 --> 41:05.958
Ready.

41:11.542 --> 41:13.251
How do I do this?

41:13.417 --> 41:15.501
You have to carry me.

41:16.042 --> 41:18.167
Hang on.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.500
Don't let me go suddenly.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

42:02.876 --> 42:05.084
Wait!

42:49.626 --> 42:51.667
<i>Mom!</i>

43:21.125 --> 43:23.458
Oh damn, this was good!

43:28.042 --> 43:30.250
Thank you.

45:01.501 --> 45:02.501
Well...

45:04.500 --> 45:06.917
I don't wear that any more.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.750
Garbage.

45:13.792 --> 45:18.500
- Garbage, garbage.
- You are throwing good things away.

45:18.667 --> 45:22.292
That's good, that dress.
You can wear with pants.

45:25.750 --> 45:28.000
Do you like that?

45:28.167 --> 45:31.167
Do you like this dress?

45:31.333 --> 45:33.542
You can have it.

45:45.200 --> 45:47.328
I like this one.

45:47.520 --> 45:49.727
Holy shit.
See those hulks?

45:49.880 --> 45:51.803
Oh shit!

45:51.958 --> 45:55.709
I fought against him twice
at the National Tournament.

45:55.876 --> 45:57.417
He's not bad!

45:58.417 --> 46:02.333
Knee, right, right.
More right, like that ...

46:07.208 --> 46:10.000
- What do you want?
- To come inside.

46:10.709 --> 46:11.751
Who is it?

46:13.542 --> 46:15.542
- Are you Martial?
- Yeah.

46:15.709 --> 46:18.167
It's ok,
let him in.

46:44.625 --> 46:48.250
- He goes down!
- Look at this.

46:48.459 --> 46:50.584
Right...
look at your right.

46:50.751 --> 46:53.001
- It's a truck!
- 90, 80 kilos!

46:53.160 --> 46:55.891
- He is not 90!
- At least 85...

46:56.042 --> 46:57.626
Look!

46:58.200 --> 46:59.247
He will finish him.

46:59.417 --> 47:01.501
Why they don't stop?

47:01.667 --> 47:02.584
But this guy ...!

47:02.751 --> 47:05.542
Knee, knee, look!

47:05.709 --> 47:07.251
Look! Right!

47:07.375 --> 47:10.000
- Do you like it?
- What?

47:10.167 --> 47:12.458
- Fighting?
- Yes.

47:13.840 --> 47:16.161
- Can you fight?
- A little, yes.

47:17.400 --> 47:19.402
Have you ever been in a combat?

47:19.584 --> 47:22.542
Long time ago,
boxing and Thai boxing.

47:23.792 --> 47:27.000
Would you like to earn money
with it?

47:27.167 --> 47:31.667
- Are you kidding me?
- I know a guy who organizes fights.

47:31.833 --> 47:35.750
A gypsy.
With gambling and everything.

47:35.917 --> 47:38.208
How do you know him?

47:38.375 --> 47:42.375
I had cameras installed
in a garage where he stole cars.

47:42.542 --> 47:45.542
He wanted the tapes from me.

47:50.800 --> 47:52.564
What kind of boxing?

47:52.720 --> 47:55.200
Like Thai Boxing,
with the feet?

47:55.360 --> 47:58.762
No, you can use everything,
elbows, knees...

48:00.360 --> 48:02.169
You really finish each other!

48:03.500 --> 48:07.958
Who remains last, wins.
You are choking me...

48:12.875 --> 48:15.708
- First time doing it?
- Yes.

48:17.000 --> 48:20.250
- Aren't you afraid?
- Afraid of what?

48:24.917 --> 48:28.208
- How much do you get?
- I don't know.

48:28.375 --> 48:32.500
Five hundred, one thousand.
Depends if I win.

48:33.542 --> 48:36.500
- You fight for 500 euros?
- Yes.

48:36.667 --> 48:40.208
Get beat up, put your health at risk,
for 500 euros?

48:40.375 --> 48:42.458
Risk my health?
Don't overdo it!

48:47.208 --> 48:52.417
I can give you 500 euros.
Cancel. I'll pay you tomorrow.

48:52.583 --> 48:56.833
If you have too much money, sure.
But I said I'd do it.

48:59.080 --> 49:00.570
If it's not the money, so why?

49:00.720 --> 49:02.449
I never said it's not the money.

49:02.640 --> 49:03.562
So why?

49:03.720 --> 49:04.960
What a pain!

49:05.542 --> 49:08.250
Why? To fight.
For the fun of it.

49:08.417 --> 49:12.542
Just like you with your fish.
Why you did that? For the fun.

49:12.708 --> 49:15.333
For the money and the fun!

49:15.520 --> 49:16.885
See how I enden up?

49:17.040 --> 49:19.168
Gimme a break!

49:22.708 --> 49:24.750
Where's your wheelchair?

49:26.376 --> 49:28.417
When you are fighting...

49:29.001 --> 49:31.626
- Can I come with you?
- Yes, sure.

49:51.280 --> 49:54.887
I'll make two moldings
for prosthetics.

49:55.040 --> 49:56.087
To make you walk.

49:56.240 --> 49:58.686
When it's done,

49:58.840 --> 50:01.923
we will put the knees,
pneumatics or electronics...

50:02.720 --> 50:04.131
What is electronic knee?

50:04.280 --> 50:07.523
The knee fixates itself.

50:07.680 --> 50:08.966
Can the feet move?

50:09.120 --> 50:11.771
No, not the feet.
They are from carbon fiber.

50:11.920 --> 50:14.321
They are flexible,
but don't move.

50:14.520 --> 50:16.124
I will walk like a robot?

50:16.280 --> 50:18.282
No, you will walk well!

50:18.440 --> 50:21.011
There are Swedish feet
that are not reimbursed ...

50:21.160 --> 50:25.961
with those you can wear
heels from 10 to 50 mm.

50:26.208 --> 50:28.792
That is important for women.

50:36.167 --> 50:38.042
Oh shoot...

50:39.583 --> 50:41.417
Stop! Good.

50:47.667 --> 50:50.542
Go. I'll take a cab.

50:50.708 --> 50:51.792
No, I'm fine.

51:23.750 --> 51:27.000
Keep an eye on Sam.
The breeder is here.

51:32.542 --> 51:35.375
- Hello? Watch your son?
- Yeah, yeah.

51:35.542 --> 51:38.125
He should not be in the garden.

51:43.375 --> 51:46.000
Stay with Daddy.
You stay with him, huh?

51:47.042 --> 51:50.333
- Sit here.
- You have cold hands.

51:56.376 --> 51:57.501
Don't touch it.

51:57.667 --> 51:59.042
Don't touch it.

52:11.250 --> 52:12.917
Did you see that?

52:13.083 --> 52:15.833
- See how strong he is?
- Who?

52:16.000 --> 52:18.458
- The black pants.
- He?

52:23.167 --> 52:25.708
Wait! Sit here!

52:26.840 --> 52:28.171
Yeah?

52:28.320 --> 52:30.687
What did he say?

52:31.920 --> 52:33.445
Hein?

52:33.640 --> 52:35.165
Why, 'the others'?

52:36.833 --> 52:39.333
How many are there?

52:40.792 --> 52:43.000
Damn,
I wasn't expecting that!

52:44.160 --> 52:46.527
Then you fight yourself!

52:46.680 --> 52:48.603
<i>Make them yourself!</i>

52:51.167 --> 52:54.209
No, is not!
I don't give a damn!

52:54.500 --> 52:57.500
Where do the dogs go?

52:57.667 --> 52:59.208
Don't worry,
go back home.

52:59.375 --> 53:02.208
Tell him that
I don't give a damn about it.

53:02.440 --> 53:04.568
What are you doing?

53:05.560 --> 53:07.403
- I told you to not let him go!
- I'm on the phone.

53:07.600 --> 53:10.206
Don't you have
nothing else to do?

53:10.360 --> 53:11.247
Come back!

53:11.400 --> 53:13.767
What the fuck?

53:13.920 --> 53:16.446
Let me go!

53:16.640 --> 53:18.847
What are you doing?

53:19.000 --> 53:21.128
Oh! oh!

53:21.280 --> 53:23.169
Oh! Calm down, yeah?

53:25.020 --> 53:26.324
Damn, you're pissing me off!

53:26.520 --> 53:28.010
You understood?

53:32.560 --> 53:35.610
Come here, come.

53:35.760 --> 53:38.366
- He has nothing.
- Get out!

53:38.560 --> 53:40.847
- But...
- Don't touch him and get out!

53:41.000 --> 53:43.924
- He has nothing, shit.
- Don't touch him!

53:44.080 --> 53:45.320
I said get out! Shit!

53:55.000 --> 53:57.333
It's over.

54:08.708 --> 54:12.208
- Martial, slowly, fuck!
- Put her belt on then.

54:12.375 --> 54:14.750
Fasten your belt.

54:25.840 --> 54:26.727
Who is she?

54:26.880 --> 54:28.405
His girlfriend.

54:28.542 --> 54:30.958
Okay. Go ahead.

54:42.625 --> 54:45.250
That guy is imitating
what he saw on TV.

54:46.500 --> 54:48.792
Who are those guys?

54:48.958 --> 54:51.875
Dealers, figures with money.

54:57.667 --> 55:00.708
- Are you OK?
- Yes, fine.

55:06.792 --> 55:10.250
- In case of problems, lie down.
- How much are the bets?

55:10.417 --> 55:14.542
Over 2000.
But will go up.

55:14.680 --> 55:15.727
And what do I do?

55:15.880 --> 55:17.041
No women.
You stay in the car.

55:17.917 --> 55:18.834
Are you ready?

55:19.626 --> 55:20.917
Come on!

56:20.792 --> 56:23.042
That was fast.

56:30.500 --> 56:33.500
- Do you have to go again?
- What?

56:34.750 --> 56:37.125
Yes, another fight after.

56:37.292 --> 56:38.792
I need to run!

56:46.125 --> 56:48.167
Fuck!

58:49.333 --> 58:52.000
Stop right there.
I want to take a shower.

59:12.600 --> 59:13.408
What is that?

59:13.600 --> 59:16.683
- For whom is that?
- For my son.

59:18.417 --> 59:20.750
- Do you have a son?
- Yes.

59:21.320 --> 59:22.367
Let's go!

59:47.417 --> 59:50.376
You're never there and
when you're there, he gets hit.

59:50.542 --> 59:51.584
Don't exaggerate!

59:51.760 --> 59:53.524
But you beat him!

59:53.680 --> 59:56.331
Accidentally.
He's not dead.

59:56.501 --> 59:58.792
Why did you brought him with you?

59:58.960 --> 01:00:01.406
It would be better
if he had stayed there.

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:03.125
This is for you.

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:07.128
- What is it?
- This is what I owe you.

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:09.567
- How did you get that?
- I won a fight.

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:12.121
Fight?
What fight?

01:00:13.126 --> 01:00:16.001
Is that your work?
Get beaten up?

01:00:16.167 --> 01:00:18.251
Do you take it or not?

01:00:18.292 --> 01:00:21.042
Don't look at me like that,
please. Shit!

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:31.888
I cheated!

01:00:32.042 --> 01:00:34.084
Who is winning?

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:36.888
Do you like it?

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.529
Oh... Do you like it?

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:41.523
Yes. Yes, Ali.

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:55.246
- Shall we go swimming?
- Yes. Yes, Ali.

01:00:59.209 --> 01:01:02.501
Look! You're stronger,
you're stronger than them.

01:01:02.667 --> 01:01:04.334
You're stronger than them?

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:06.443
- Give daddy a kiss.
- I don't want to.

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:08.927
Yes, you want.
Give daddy a kiss!

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:10.206
- No!
- Yes!

01:01:10.376 --> 01:01:12.001
Yes!

01:01:12.167 --> 01:01:14.209
No! I don't want to!

01:01:23.417 --> 01:01:25.626
Shut up!

01:01:27.125 --> 01:01:28.917
Oh, damn!

01:02:18.625 --> 01:02:20.792
Put it there.

01:02:27.625 --> 01:02:31.125
That's it.
Come back now.

01:02:31.292 --> 01:02:33.333
Come back.

01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:39.329
My job is not
watching the customers.

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:41.329
But watching the staff.

01:02:43.375 --> 01:02:45.917
Suppose you're the manager
of a supermarket.

01:02:46.083 --> 01:02:49.917
You have too many staff around.
What do you do?

01:02:50.083 --> 01:02:53.917
- I fire them.
- There must be a good reason!

01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:57.848
You try to know if they stay
too long in the toilet,

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.209
or if they pauses too long.

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:04.887
You should build up pressure.
Those who don't quit, you fire.

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:10.403
That's what my cameras are for.

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:13.570
I work for the managers.

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:15.927
For bosses in their
three-piece suits.

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:17.889
It's overwhelming.

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:21.123
There is no big supermarket
without my cameras.

01:03:21.208 --> 01:03:23.042
Is that legal?

01:03:23.208 --> 01:03:26.208
Legal? Who determines that?

01:03:26.375 --> 01:03:31.083
But if a manager gets caught,
he has a trial on his ass.

01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:33.708
And I go to jail.

01:03:43.375 --> 01:03:45.500
Left! left!
On your left!

01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:48.083
Wait, I'll wave!

01:03:57.625 --> 01:03:59.708
Shit, that's brilliant.

01:04:01.583 --> 01:04:04.417
- How long?
- Two days.

01:04:13.334 --> 01:04:16.042
- Can I see?
- Yeah.

01:04:31.167 --> 01:04:33.625
We go swimming?

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.250
In the beach? I don't know.

01:04:37.417 --> 01:04:41.375
It's different now.
I don't know if I want to undress.

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:52.566
Do you have a girlfriend?
A fiancée?

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:53.767
No.

01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:55.888
No love life at all?

01:04:56.042 --> 01:04:58.251
Yes, but no fiancée.

01:04:59.126 --> 01:05:02.084
what is it?
Only to fuck?

01:05:02.792 --> 01:05:03.667
Yeah.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000
- Do you have many flings?
- No.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.207
Does it annoy you
to talk about it?

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:17.249
No, I don't care.

01:05:19.833 --> 01:05:22.458
And you, were you
with a lot of guys?

01:05:23.667 --> 01:05:25.501
- Before?
- Yes.

01:05:25.667 --> 01:05:27.834
I was with Simon.

01:05:28.333 --> 01:05:31.042
Is that all?

01:05:31.208 --> 01:05:35.208
No, there were others,
but not many.

01:05:36.250 --> 01:05:38.417
I was very ...

01:05:39.917 --> 01:05:42.334
I liked being watched.

01:05:43.167 --> 01:05:45.751
I liked turning them on.

01:05:48.042 --> 01:05:50.917
I liked getting them excited.

01:05:52.501 --> 01:05:55.084
But then,
I'd get bored.

01:05:59.417 --> 01:06:00.459
And now?

01:06:02.709 --> 01:06:03.876
Nothing.

01:06:07.458 --> 01:06:10.417
I forgot what it's like.

01:06:10.583 --> 01:06:14.208
I don't know if it still works.

01:06:14.375 --> 01:06:16.917
No more desire?

01:06:17.083 --> 01:06:20.458
I never said that.
Sure I feel desire.

01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:24.000
Let's change the subject.

01:06:27.167 --> 01:06:29.584
- I'll do it.
- No, wait.

01:06:29.751 --> 01:06:32.126
I have legs, they must serve me.

01:06:38.250 --> 01:06:40.417
Do you want to fuck?

01:06:41.042 --> 01:06:41.959
Huh?

01:06:42.792 --> 01:06:43.709
What?

01:06:44.792 --> 01:06:49.167
You want to know if it still works?
So, let's fuck.

01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:55.889
Just like that?

01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:58.691
Yeah!

01:07:02.333 --> 01:07:05.750
I don't know if I can do it
just like that.

01:07:06.875 --> 01:07:09.292
When you feel like it, tell me.

01:07:13.167 --> 01:07:14.167
Wait ...

01:08:03.042 --> 01:08:05.251
Come ... Come!

01:08:45.875 --> 01:08:48.792
Do you mind if we don't kiss
on the mouth?

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:51.292
No, it's OK.

01:08:51.457 --> 01:08:53.917
And on your breasts, can I?

01:08:54.626 --> 01:08:55.584
Yes.

01:09:04.917 --> 01:09:06.709
Wait, you're crushing me...

01:09:06.876 --> 01:09:10.042
- You gotta stop talking now.
- Ok.

01:09:15.209 --> 01:09:16.917
Slowly ...

01:09:23.834 --> 01:09:24.876
Slowly.

01:09:25.042 --> 01:09:28.084
Slowly ...

01:09:53.834 --> 01:09:55.459
Are you OK?

01:09:57.083 --> 01:09:59.292
Was it good?

01:10:00.917 --> 01:10:02.292
It still works?

01:10:03.709 --> 01:10:04.709
Yes.

01:10:05.417 --> 01:10:07.209
No ...
I don't know ...

01:10:08.126 --> 01:10:10.834
It's different.
It's hard to say after just one ...

01:10:11.001 --> 01:10:13.376
Yeah but I can't now.
I have to go.

01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:15.881
That's not what I meant.

01:10:16.792 --> 01:10:19.500
- It's new, so ...
- Was it good or not?

01:10:19.834 --> 01:10:21.959
Yes, it was good.

01:10:23.375 --> 01:10:28.125
Well, when you feel like it, call me.
If I'm OP, I'll come.

01:10:29.209 --> 01:10:30.917
What does that mean, 'OP'?

01:10:31.084 --> 01:10:34.084
Operational.
When I'm available, when I can.

01:10:35.458 --> 01:10:38.333
- When you're OP, we ...
- Yes.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.208
What?

01:10:44.375 --> 01:10:46.833
Nothing, it's great.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.083
I'm going. Bye.

01:14:13.167 --> 01:14:14.667
Are you OK?

01:14:14.834 --> 01:14:17.084
Stéphanie!

01:14:18.042 --> 01:14:19.917
<i>Good to see you!</i>

01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:40.770
Oh, thank you... Yes.

01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:43.048
It's true, I missed.

01:14:49.208 --> 01:14:51.333
<i>OP?</i>

01:15:27.750 --> 01:15:30.250
Oh shit,
get dressed, quickly!

01:15:30.417 --> 01:15:32.292
- What is it?
- My sister.

01:15:34.501 --> 01:15:36.709
Shit, you scared me!

01:15:36.876 --> 01:15:39.834
- I am with a friend.
- Do you bring girls now?

01:15:40.001 --> 01:15:42.417
Stéphanie, come here,
I will introduce you to my sister!

01:15:42.584 --> 01:15:44.451
- It's the girl from Marineland.
- What?

01:15:44.517 --> 01:15:47.167
- The girl from Marineland.
- Ah...

01:15:49.084 --> 01:15:50.959
Oh shit, poor girl.

01:15:51.126 --> 01:15:53.501
- Good morning.
- Anna ... Stéphanie.

01:15:56.583 --> 01:15:58.375
Four times.

01:15:58.542 --> 01:16:00.458
That's enough!

01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:06.921
- That's him?
- Yeah...

01:16:09.042 --> 01:16:11.083
Good morning!

01:16:24.917 --> 01:16:27.583
- How old is he?
- Five.

01:16:28.751 --> 01:16:30.667
I don't have more grapefruit!

01:16:30.834 --> 01:16:34.376
- No problem.
- I've got multivitamine juice.

01:16:34.542 --> 01:16:36.292
- Do you drink tea?
- No.

01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:38.807
- I'll make some tea.
- No, it's OK!

01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:41.042
- Sit down.
- This is perfect!

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:43.680
<i>No, it's OK!</i>

01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:46.446
- Don't you wanna go?
- Why?

01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:48.529
She pisses me off with her tea.

01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:51.889
- She's very nice.
- Yeah, very nice ...

01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:55.407
She feels like a cashier
with you.

01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:57.849
- Here.
- Thank you.

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:05.442
Thank you.

01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:13.443
- Do you sleep here?
- Yes.

01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:16.371
Nice room.

01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:23.208
Why are you looking at me
like that?

01:17:23.833 --> 01:17:26.208
It scares you?

01:17:27.667 --> 01:17:30.167
- Want to see it?
- Yes.

01:17:41.667 --> 01:17:43.875
Does it hurt?

01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:45.764
No.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.042
Feel it.

01:18:12.126 --> 01:18:13.959
<i>Yeah! Again!</i>

01:18:14.126 --> 01:18:16.376
<i>Again! Go!</i>

01:18:16.542 --> 01:18:19.376
<i>Come on, go!</i>

01:18:25.376 --> 01:18:27.751
You go, you pass...

01:18:27.917 --> 01:18:30.709
You put your hand here.

01:18:31.583 --> 01:18:37.458
This hand here, will search
the leg on the other side.

01:18:41.333 --> 01:18:43.208
Same movement.

01:18:44.417 --> 01:18:46.626
Go ... That's good.

01:18:49.417 --> 01:18:52.209
Go!

01:19:46.751 --> 01:19:49.334
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not.

01:19:49.501 --> 01:19:51.459
That guy will kill me.

01:19:53.334 --> 01:19:54.376
Are you ready?

01:22:05.626 --> 01:22:07.501
VIP Area, OK?

01:22:50.501 --> 01:22:52.251
Do you want to move?

01:22:52.417 --> 01:22:54.001
To dance?

01:22:54.876 --> 01:22:55.917
Come on!

01:22:58.208 --> 01:23:00.125
I'll go.

01:24:06.584 --> 01:24:08.376
- Here.
- Thank you.

01:24:16.709 --> 01:24:19.001
I'm going.
I'll call you tomorrow, OK?

01:24:19.167 --> 01:24:21.292
- Are you going?
- Yeah, I'm going!

01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:26.527
Guys, until next time.
Thank you very much!

01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:28.320
Thank you!

01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:31.000
Until next time!

01:24:52.417 --> 01:24:54.542
Do you want to drink
something?

01:24:55.708 --> 01:24:58.250
Do you want to drink
something?

01:24:58.417 --> 01:25:00.583
Yes, champagne.

01:25:00.750 --> 01:25:03.208
Two champagne Mika!

01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:05.842
My name is Pierre.
And yours?

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.082
- My name is Marie.
- Marie?

01:25:08.375 --> 01:25:10.917
Do you come here often?

01:25:11.209 --> 01:25:13.001
Occasionally.

01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:35.805
Oh no.

01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:38.804
I'm sorry, not tonight,
I don't feel like it.

01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:39.847
Don't worry.

01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:45.090
I'm going.
Thanks for the drink.

01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:46.366
No, it's OK.

01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:48.571
Sorry, I ...

01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:51.005
Sorry for what?

01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:53.322
- I didn't know ...
- What you didn't know?

01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:55.329
I couldn't know that ...

01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:57.727
That you have a ...
That you did not have ...

01:25:57.800 --> 01:25:59.584
What you couldn't know?
Asshole!

01:26:09.876 --> 01:26:11.751
Look what she did to me!

01:26:11.917 --> 01:26:13.292
Don't touch it!

01:27:05.958 --> 01:27:08.167
Everything alright?

01:27:15.833 --> 01:27:19.625
- You guys stayed late?
- I don't know.

01:27:20.708 --> 01:27:23.625
- And you, how was it?
- Normal.

01:27:30.708 --> 01:27:33.583
You think this is
a normal conversation?

01:27:33.750 --> 01:27:39.000
I ask you how went with the girl
and you answer 'normal'.

01:27:39.167 --> 01:27:41.750
What should I say?

01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:46.684
Nothing.

01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:47.966
What?

01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:51.522
Do you think it's 'normal' 
to pick up a bimbo in front of me?

01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:54.206
- What would you say if I did that?
- Nothing.

01:27:54.376 --> 01:27:55.376
Oh, really?

01:27:55.542 --> 01:27:57.334
- Wouldn't you care?
- Shit!

01:27:57.501 --> 01:28:00.917
Stop, damn! You're being a pain.
What's the problem?

01:28:02.751 --> 01:28:04.626
What am I for you?

01:28:05.376 --> 01:28:06.459
A friend?

01:28:06.917 --> 01:28:08.083
A girlfriend?

01:28:08.250 --> 01:28:10.958
A buddy, like Foued
and the others?

01:28:11.125 --> 01:28:13.750
Do you fuck your buddies?

01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:25.848
If you want to continue,
we have to do things right.

01:28:26.001 --> 01:28:27.792
Let's show some manners.

01:28:28.917 --> 01:28:31.501
I'm talking about delicacy.

01:28:33.125 --> 01:28:37.375
You know what it is. You've always
been so delicate with me.

01:28:42.584 --> 01:28:44.209
We'll do like this?

01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:50.583
We'll continue,
but not like animals.

01:28:58.708 --> 01:29:00.833
What is it?

01:29:03.667 --> 01:29:06.125
I'm OP.

01:29:08.583 --> 01:29:11.375
That's it, I am OP.

01:29:11.542 --> 01:29:14.500
Why are you looking
at me like that?

01:29:14.584 --> 01:29:16.959
- Don't you want it?
- No.

01:29:20.917 --> 01:29:22.917
Why not?

01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:19.243
Calm down or I'll have
the store evacuated.

01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:22.449
- Don't bother.
- We'll call the police!

01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:23.721
The police!

01:30:23.876 --> 01:30:25.792
Remove the stuff.

01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:27.928
They will see that you spy!

01:30:28.084 --> 01:30:30.459
- We will close the store.
- That's it!

01:30:30.626 --> 01:30:33.834
Don't you dare
even looking at us!

01:30:34.001 --> 01:30:36.167
Don't touch me.

01:30:36.792 --> 01:30:40.542
The guy is wrong and wants to call
the police! Bravo!

01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:48.842
What are you doing?

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.684
I'm packing up.

01:30:50.708 --> 01:30:53.333
- Are yours?
- No.

01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:54.801
No photos!

01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:56.530
Do you work for them?

01:30:56.680 --> 01:30:58.091
No photos, I said!

01:30:58.240 --> 01:30:59.924
You were filming us!

01:31:00.208 --> 01:31:03.125
I'll beat you, shut up!

01:31:03.292 --> 01:31:05.500
Come on, let's get out!

01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:11.443
We got you!

01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:13.563
Shut up!

01:31:15.501 --> 01:31:18.251
I have to go away
for three or four months.

01:31:19.208 --> 01:31:23.833
Ali wants to continue fighting.
Would you like to replace me?

01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:28.610
But does he agree?

01:31:28.751 --> 01:31:31.251
He's the one who asked me
to call you.

01:31:34.226 --> 01:31:35.465
Why me?

01:31:35.542 --> 01:31:37.501
He trusts you, I guess.

01:31:38.167 --> 01:31:40.875
I don't know nothing about that world.
I don't know those guys.

01:31:42.501 --> 01:31:44.501
Do you see me dealing
with those beasts?

01:31:45.126 --> 01:31:46.167
Yes.

01:31:46.334 --> 01:31:47.584
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:31:49.625 --> 01:31:53.917
Everything is in here.
If you have questions, let me know.

01:31:56.167 --> 01:32:00.708
- And the bets?
- You have fingers to count.

01:32:01.001 --> 01:32:02.709
- Here, the Clio.
- No, no.

01:32:02.876 --> 01:32:05.376
This?

01:32:05.542 --> 01:32:07.834
I noticed that you have a problem ...

01:32:08.001 --> 01:32:10.501
Yeah. I want an automatic.

01:32:10.667 --> 01:32:12.542
This is what
you need.

01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:14.609
No, that's ugly.

01:32:46.625 --> 01:32:48.875
RIGHT

01:33:37.251 --> 01:33:38.876
What's up, Robocop?

01:33:39.042 --> 01:33:40.334
This is a circus!

01:33:40.501 --> 01:33:42.084
- How much is it?
- 3400.

01:33:42.251 --> 01:33:44.376
- 3400?
- Are you ready?

01:34:12.583 --> 01:34:14.667
I'm here.

01:34:16.959 --> 01:34:18.917
Don't look at me like that.

01:34:19.084 --> 01:34:22.042
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to pee.

01:34:24.376 --> 01:34:26.251
Can you give me my t-shirt?

01:34:26.417 --> 01:34:28.376
- What time is it?
- Six o'clock.

01:34:32.376 --> 01:34:34.167
Shit, I've fallen asleep.

01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:37.602
I don't want you
to see me like this.

01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:39.603
Hold on.

01:34:39.751 --> 01:34:41.001
Come here.

01:34:54.792 --> 01:34:57.000
It's OK?

01:35:09.042 --> 01:35:10.917
What?
What's the matter?

01:35:25.542 --> 01:35:28.125
Can we do this now?

01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:39.825
LEFT

01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:01.568
- The management wants to see you.
- What?

01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:02.881
The management wants to see you.

01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:06.850
- Wait here.
- Here?

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.525
Yes.

01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:11.286
You too?

01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:15.963
<i>Do you know
why we're here?</i>

01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:38.324
So?

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.526
- I got fired.
- Don't worry, sweetie.

01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:43.569
There's something
we want to show you.

01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:47.521
That's it.

01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:49.682
Here he packs up the stuff.

01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:52.161
And here he wanted to beat me.

01:36:53.542 --> 01:36:59.011
Then he go away.
But I've caught him in flagrante.

01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:37.570
Are you okay?

01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:41.564
What are you doing?

01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:43.961
- I'm hungry.
- Close it.

01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:46.684
You don't eat here.

01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:50.649
You don't eat here!

01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:52.564
Are you kidding me?

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:57.209
I was fired this morning.
I'm unemployed.

01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:09.610
What's the relation
with I can't eat here?

01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:16.284
What's the relation?
There's cameras in the warehouse.

01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:21.051
They filmed us when we took
the expired food. They fired us.

01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:23.123
You had your sister fired.

01:38:27.333 --> 01:38:29.667
How does it feel?

01:38:32.083 --> 01:38:34.708
How much did you get for that?

01:38:34.875 --> 01:38:38.083
You get paid per person
or a flat rate?

01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:43.804
You don't say anything?

01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:49.127
I give you shelter, I take care
of your son, you make me fired.

01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:51.044
But you have nothing to say!

01:38:51.417 --> 01:38:52.667
Great.

01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:57.687
- I couldn't know.
- Yeah, you couldn't know.

01:38:57.840 --> 01:38:59.649
But I don't understand.

01:39:00.333 --> 01:39:03.042
How can you do
such a thing?

01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:06.440
Which side are you?
You're with them?

01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:09.846
Shit, what do you have
in your head?

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.525
What didn't you know?

01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:15.127
That you'd bring us into shit?

01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:16.964
Can't you think?

01:39:37.792 --> 01:39:39.917
Calm down!

01:39:40.083 --> 01:39:42.667
Calm down, I said.

01:39:42.833 --> 01:39:45.833
Take your stuff
and get out of here.

01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:48.047
We don't want to see you
around here anymore.

01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:50.689
Come on, get out!

01:40:34.400 --> 01:40:37.760
<i>OP?</i>

01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:14.007
This is the mess
he left behind.

01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:17.220
In his message he said
he was in Strasbourg.

01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:19.683
I don't know what
he's doing there.

01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:22.320
- Didn't he call you?
- No.

01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:24.841
Have you been to the gym?

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:26.889
They don't know nothing.

01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:29.930
If I had an address or a number,
I'd give it to you.

01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:32.280
I'm sure this is bullshit
after what he did to me.

01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:34.131
Do you believe me?

01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:36.846
Yeah, I believe you.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.685
Do you not realize?
He left his kid.

01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:41.922
He doesn't care about anything!

01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:44.765
- You don't know him.
- Me? I don't know him?

01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:48.003
- What did you expect from him?
- I don't know.

01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:49.207
Not this.

01:42:50.875 --> 01:42:53.375
To the right.
Raise your hands.

01:42:55.880 --> 01:42:58.804
Faster. Raise your hands,
focus your blows.

01:43:04.208 --> 01:43:06.583
<i>- Is there any coffee left?
- Coffee?</i>

01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:10.860
- Coffee?
- Yeah.

01:43:43.417 --> 01:43:45.667
- Are you okay?
- Yes. And you?

01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:48.207
I will not further,
otherwise I'll get stuck.

01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:50.840
Do you got a new truck now?

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:54.004
I changed my boss.
I'm back to the exploiters.

01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:55.685
Ali?

01:43:55.840 --> 01:43:59.049
- Sam, put your jacket on!
- Everything okay at home?

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:01.843
Yeah, everything okay.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:03.047
And Anna?

01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:07.850
Fine. She found a job
in a school canteen.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:09.604
She seems to like it.

01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:16.458
- Does she know this?
- Of course.

01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:21.605
Tell her that I can't help now.
But when I have money ...

01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:23.922
- Okay?
- Don't worry, go.

01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:27.084
- When will you fight?
- Next month, on the 9th.

01:44:27.240 --> 01:44:28.287
You tell us?

01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:30.169
Sure.

01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:33.881
Come on, Sam.
I give you Mr. Sam!

01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:35.926
My mittens!

01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:38.560
A kiss!
Come on, hop!

01:44:39.125 --> 01:44:41.542
Handover.

01:44:44.750 --> 01:44:48.958
I'll deliver my load in Colmar
and pick up the kid at 19hrs.

01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:52.128
Ali? I count on you: 19hrs.

01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:55.250
- Okay.
- I have to be back tomorrow at 11hrs.

01:44:55.400 --> 01:44:57.101
- Okay, don't worry.
- Have a nice day.

01:44:57.200 --> 01:44:58.685
Thank you.
Goodbye!

01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:01.647
Sam, you make a snowman?

01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:04.007
- Goodbye!
- Have a nice day!

01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:06.891
- I'll bring fries for you!
- OK!

01:45:15.100 --> 01:45:16.926
I want to skate, too.

01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:19.608
It's not skate,
it's ski.

01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:22.001
- It's Skate.
- No, it's Ski.

01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:23.969
Skate!

01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:27.763
- Ski.
- You're annoying me.

01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:31.206
Sam!

01:45:34.833 --> 01:45:37.708
Faster!

01:45:37.875 --> 01:45:40.958
I'll let you go.
Then you can do it yourself.

01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:44.041
Go, go!

01:45:44.750 --> 01:45:46.168
Oh shit!

01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:27.646
Watch out!
Take the sled!

01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:29.529
Sit on it!

01:46:32.750 --> 01:46:35.333
One, two, three ... go!

01:46:48.417 --> 01:46:50.333
Oh shit!

01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:52.882
Again.

01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:03.010
- We are going back in 10 minutes, OK?
- Yes!

01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:17.011
<i>Ouch.</i>

01:47:23.420 --> 01:47:24.110
Sam!

01:47:28.140 --> 01:47:28.528
Sam!

01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:32.931
Sam!

01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:36.325
Sam!

01:47:57.680 --> 01:47:59.364
Sam!

01:48:00.167 --> 01:48:01.333
Help!

01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:53.602
Sam!

01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:57.329
Come on!

01:48:57.880 --> 01:48:59.962
Sam! Sam!

01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:02.365
Sam!

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.750
We'll take care of you now.

01:50:07.542 --> 01:50:09.583
Come.

01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:06.724
Can you hold?

01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:08.644
Yes, thank you.

01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:10.401
Thank you.

01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:32.004
Hello?

01:51:32.160 --> 01:51:33.730
Hum...

01:51:34.750 --> 01:51:37.292
Yes, it's better.

01:51:37.458 --> 01:51:40.458
I will pass to him.

01:51:40.625 --> 01:51:42.625
Here. She wants to talk to you.

01:51:42.792 --> 01:51:45.167
- It's Anna?
- No.

01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:48.084
Hello?

01:51:48.792 --> 01:51:51.000
<i>It's me.</i>

01:51:52.375 --> 01:51:54.833
<i>It bothers you?</i>

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:56.792
No.

01:51:59.500 --> 01:52:02.042
<i>How is he?</i>

01:52:02.208 --> 01:52:05.208
He woke up an hour ago.

01:52:08.375 --> 01:52:12.125
<i>- Is he injured?</i>
- No, I don't think so.

01:52:14.083 --> 01:52:16.667
<i>And how are you?</i>

01:52:16.833 --> 01:52:19.875
I broke my hands
on the ice.

01:52:21.792 --> 01:52:24.083
<i>Is it serious?</i>

01:52:24.250 --> 01:52:27.042
They're fractured.

01:52:33.500 --> 01:52:36.458
And are you okay?

01:52:36.625 --> 01:52:38.500
<i>Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

01:52:38.667 --> 01:52:43.542
- What are you doing?
<i>- At this moment? In life?</i>

01:52:43.708 --> 01:52:46.375
<i>- Or in general?</i>
- I wanted to say that ...

01:52:46.542 --> 01:52:50.750
<i>I'm not asking for anything.
I'm hanging up.</i>

01:52:50.917 --> 01:52:54.875
<i>I'll call you to ask about Sam.
Give him a kiss?</i>

01:52:55.042 --> 01:52:57.208
Don't hang up!

01:52:59.560 --> 01:53:01.244
Don't hang up!

01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:03.368
<i>I won't hang up.</i>

01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:13.647
For three hours...

01:53:13.800 --> 01:53:16.087
He's was in a coma.

01:53:16.833 --> 01:53:19.500
For three hours,
he was dead.

01:53:22.375 --> 01:53:25.333
I was scared to lose him.

01:53:31.640 --> 01:53:33.165
Don't leave me!

01:53:33.320 --> 01:53:36.051
<i>I won't leave you...</i>

01:53:43.360 --> 01:53:45.124
I love you.

01:54:10.958 --> 01:54:13.750
<i>In a human hand
there are 27 bones.</i>

01:54:15.320 --> 01:54:17.641
<i>Some apes have more.</i>

01:54:17.800 --> 01:54:20.770
<i>A gorilla has 32,
five in each thumb.</i>

01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:23.048
<i>A human has 27.</i>

01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:25.646
<i>If you break an arm
or a leg ...</i>

01:54:26.440 --> 01:54:29.603
<i>The bone grows back together
by calcification.</i>

01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:32.721
<i>It will be stronger
than before.</i>

01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:38.604
<i>If you break a bone in your hand,
it will never recover completely.</i>

01:54:41.360 --> 01:54:45.081
<i>Before every fight, you'll think.
In each slap, you'll think.</i>

01:54:46.417 --> 01:54:48.625
<i>You'll be careful.</i>

01:54:48.792 --> 01:54:52.292
<i>But at some point...
the pain will come back.</i>

01:54:53.667 --> 01:54:56.042
<i>Like needles.</i>

01:54:56.208 --> 01:54:58.708
<i>Like glass splinters.</i>

01:56:12.008 --> 01:56:16.308
