WEBVTT

00:01.201 --> 00:03.436
When are you coming home,
daddy?

00:04.805 --> 00:07.040
(sighs)
Very soon, sweetie.

00:07.073 --> 00:08.408
Very soon, okay?

00:10.544 --> 00:11.512
Very soon.

00:12.846 --> 00:15.281
Okay, daddy has to have
a meeting now, okay?

00:15.315 --> 00:17.183
All right.
Kiss your mommy.

00:17.217 --> 00:19.252
I'll be right out,
sweetheart.

00:19.285 --> 00:20.721
Anna.

00:20.754 --> 00:22.022
Come on now.

00:28.161 --> 00:30.030
Eight years.

00:31.297 --> 00:32.633
Eight years?

00:32.665 --> 00:35.268
BERLUTI: Out in five
with good behavior.

00:35.301 --> 00:37.838
Personally,
I think it's a decent offer.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.105
MARCIE: Decent?

00:39.139 --> 00:41.074
It's decent
for innocent people

00:41.107 --> 00:42.643
to plead guilty to murder?

00:42.676 --> 00:43.744
WASHINGTON: Marcie...

00:43.777 --> 00:45.211
what would be indecent

00:45.245 --> 00:47.681
is for your husband
to serve a life sentence.

00:47.714 --> 00:49.716
They don't even have a body.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.151
How can they possibly prove
that he--

00:51.184 --> 00:52.285
BERLUTI: They got a witness.

00:52.318 --> 00:54.087
They got forensics.

00:54.120 --> 00:55.522
And let's not kid ourselves.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.157
Tom going on the lam--

00:57.190 --> 00:58.024
TOM: Because I knew

00:58.058 --> 00:59.560
that they would jump
to the conclusion

00:59.593 --> 01:00.601
that I did it, Jimmy.

01:00.634 --> 01:02.368
Whatever the reason

01:02.402 --> 01:03.804
you ran, Tom.

01:03.837 --> 01:07.340
You lived under a false name
for almost 10 years.

01:07.373 --> 01:09.142
WASHINGTON: Look...

01:09.175 --> 01:12.112
it's your life,
it's obviously your call.

01:12.145 --> 01:14.080
But given the risk,

01:14.114 --> 01:16.482
we think you have to consider
the eight years.

01:16.517 --> 01:19.085
In which case?

01:19.119 --> 01:21.755
By the time I get out,
my daughter's 12.

01:21.788 --> 01:23.790
And in the meantime,
she grows up thinking

01:23.824 --> 01:25.191
her dad's a killer.

01:25.859 --> 01:29.062
I will not let that happen.

01:29.095 --> 01:30.597
If we lose,

01:30.631 --> 01:34.501
your daughter grows up
without a dad forever.

01:35.836 --> 01:38.138
I am rejecting the offer.

01:41.542 --> 01:43.376
They turned it down?

01:43.409 --> 01:44.645
I just got the call.

01:44.678 --> 01:46.847
Well, I'd go back with five.

01:46.880 --> 01:48.515
For a first degree murder?

01:48.549 --> 01:50.851
Ken, you've got no body.

01:50.884 --> 01:52.619
We've won
with no bodies before.

01:52.653 --> 01:53.520
GAMBLE: Look at me.

01:53.554 --> 01:56.623
Please do not let
your competitive bile

01:56.657 --> 01:59.593
suck out what little remains
of your judgment.

01:59.626 --> 02:01.334
That's not encouragement,
Helen.

02:01.367 --> 02:03.403
I thought we agreed
to be encouraging

02:03.436 --> 02:04.370
with one another.

02:04.404 --> 02:07.774
I'm encouraging you
to plead this one out.

02:07.808 --> 02:11.077
I am not going to let
a premeditated murderer

02:11.111 --> 02:12.345
get off with five years.

02:12.378 --> 02:13.814
That goes against
my conscience,

02:13.847 --> 02:16.182
not to mention my bile.

02:20.120 --> 02:23.524
Did he say what this was about?
Not to me.

02:23.557 --> 02:24.658
WASHINGTON: He's been such
a whackadoo these days,

02:24.691 --> 02:25.792
it could be about anything.

02:25.826 --> 02:27.260
LUCY: Well, it must be big.

02:27.293 --> 02:28.361
He wanted me here.

02:28.394 --> 02:29.696
I'm never included in anything.

02:29.730 --> 02:31.698
BERLUTI: Well,
he better get here fast.

02:31.732 --> 02:32.699
We're in trial.

02:32.733 --> 02:34.835
Maybe he and Lindsay
are getting back together.

02:34.868 --> 02:36.703
Why would he have a meeting
to say that?

02:36.737 --> 02:38.438
Because he's such a whackadoo?

02:38.471 --> 02:41.141
FRUTT: Jamie, your attitude
has taken a little dip lately.

02:41.174 --> 02:42.142
Have you noticed that?

02:42.175 --> 02:43.677
DONNELL: Sorry I'm late.

02:43.710 --> 02:45.111
Thanks for coming.

02:45.145 --> 02:46.079
What's going on?

02:48.448 --> 02:50.450
I've decided to resign.

02:52.152 --> 02:55.288
I'll be leaving the firm
pretty much immediately.

02:55.321 --> 02:57.558
Eugene, you'll take over
as senior partner.

02:59.593 --> 03:01.201
I know this comes as a shock,

03:01.234 --> 03:03.469
but it's just something I feel

03:03.504 --> 03:05.438
I have to do.

03:05.471 --> 03:06.773
I'll be here
for the next few days

03:06.807 --> 03:08.274
to work out logistics,

03:08.308 --> 03:10.176
so we don't have to say
our goodbyes yet.

03:14.280 --> 03:15.048
That's all.

03:15.081 --> 03:18.018
(footsteps departing)

03:26.159 --> 03:27.193
(door opens)

03:28.161 --> 03:30.430
(door closes)

03:31.832 --> 03:33.433
What was that?

03:33.466 --> 03:35.702
It's a long story, Eugene.

03:39.405 --> 03:40.707
I got time.

03:40.741 --> 03:42.676
First, let's deal with what--

03:42.709 --> 03:45.178
YOUNG: First,
let's deal with why.

03:46.179 --> 03:48.815
I'm just not happy here
anymore, Eugene.

03:48.849 --> 03:51.317
Fine. Why?

03:51.351 --> 03:53.854
It's nothing personal
against any of you.

03:53.887 --> 03:55.088
Fine.

03:55.121 --> 03:55.856
What is it then?

03:55.889 --> 03:57.558
It's just personal stuff.

03:57.591 --> 03:58.525
Can we leave it at that?

03:58.559 --> 04:00.133
No, we can't, Bobby.

04:00.166 --> 04:02.603
You see, you and I,
we are personal.

04:02.636 --> 04:04.104
We've always put it out there,

04:04.137 --> 04:05.105
and for something like this--

04:05.138 --> 04:06.106
DONNELL: I'm not...

04:06.139 --> 04:09.209
exactly sure of the why.

04:10.276 --> 04:12.813
It probably has something
to do with me and Lindsay,

04:12.846 --> 04:15.816
but...

04:15.849 --> 04:17.350
it's more than that.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.786
And I feel like...

04:19.820 --> 04:21.588
I've hit a wall here.

04:23.857 --> 04:27.093
And I feel like I'm gonna crash.

04:27.127 --> 04:29.295
And I just need to leave

04:29.329 --> 04:32.265
before I become wreckage.

04:34.868 --> 04:37.170
You owe us an explanation,
Bobby.

04:37.203 --> 04:38.672
I just--
YOUNG: And I don't mean

04:38.705 --> 04:41.341
all of the cliches
you've just spewed out.

04:44.310 --> 04:47.648
You owe us a reason.

04:50.717 --> 04:53.086
WALSH: Her name
was Rachel Rosenblum.

04:54.320 --> 04:56.723
She disappeared 10 years ago.

04:56.757 --> 04:58.759
She was 25 years old.

04:58.792 --> 05:01.301
They found her blood
soaking the rug

05:01.334 --> 05:02.435
in her living room,

05:02.468 --> 05:04.805
but they never found her body.

05:04.838 --> 05:07.140
Now, before you start feeling
too sorry for her,

05:07.173 --> 05:08.074
let me tell you,

05:08.108 --> 05:11.477
Rachel Rosenblum
was a murderer herself.

05:11.512 --> 05:14.347
She killed her husband,

05:14.380 --> 05:17.050
who just so happened to be
the defendant's brother.

05:17.083 --> 05:19.085
And the defendant,

05:19.119 --> 05:20.386
well,

05:20.420 --> 05:21.755
as the evidence will show,

05:21.788 --> 05:25.158
he decided to take the law
into his own hands.

05:25.191 --> 05:27.661
Before the jury
could ever return a verdict

05:27.694 --> 05:30.163
in Rachel Rosenblum's trial,

05:30.196 --> 05:33.133
Tom Bartos killed her,

05:33.166 --> 05:35.769
then dumped her body
in the Atlantic Ocean.

05:39.472 --> 05:42.576
They've got no evidence
that shows that.

05:42.609 --> 05:45.145
They can't even prove
she's dead.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.246
Basically...

05:46.279 --> 05:48.815
all they have
is the likelihood

05:48.849 --> 05:51.117
that Rachel Rosenblum was killed

05:51.151 --> 05:52.619
during her own murder trial.

05:52.653 --> 05:54.755
And they figure
my guy had motive,

05:54.788 --> 05:57.123
so he must've done it.

05:57.157 --> 05:59.159
Well, he didn't do it.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.502
Talk about rush to judgment.

06:01.535 --> 06:03.403
Here, they can't even wait

06:03.436 --> 06:05.471
to make sure she's dead.

06:07.473 --> 06:10.376
SIMONS: He became a fugitive
in October 1992,

06:10.410 --> 06:12.145
when we were about
to arrest him for the murder

06:12.178 --> 06:14.515
of his sister-in-law,
Rachel Rosenblum.

06:14.548 --> 06:17.684
Detective, why was he
under suspicion for this murder?

06:17.718 --> 06:20.787
Rachel was married
to his brother, Adrian Bartos,

06:20.821 --> 06:24.457
who she stabbed to death
in the summer of 1992.

06:24.490 --> 06:26.126
What led you to believe

06:26.159 --> 06:28.562
Ms. Rosenblum herself
had been killed?

06:28.595 --> 06:30.063
She was out on bail.

06:30.096 --> 06:32.432
The jury was deliberating
over the weekend

06:32.465 --> 06:34.568
and she didn't show up
for the verdict,

06:34.601 --> 06:36.503
which was a conviction,
by the way.

06:36.537 --> 06:37.571
Did you look for her?

06:37.604 --> 06:39.105
SIMONS: We went to her house.

06:39.139 --> 06:40.674
There were signs of a break-in

06:40.707 --> 06:42.609
and there were enormous amounts
of her blood

06:42.643 --> 06:43.810
in her living room rug.

06:43.844 --> 06:46.747
We found one of her teeth
under the couch,

06:46.780 --> 06:48.314
and there were bloody drag marks

06:48.348 --> 06:50.116
into the bathroom tub.

06:50.150 --> 06:53.153
We believe her killer
cut her body up there

06:53.186 --> 06:56.189
so he could carry it
out of her house easier.

06:56.222 --> 06:57.758
Some of her luggage was missing

06:57.791 --> 07:01.334
and we assume it was used
to get rid of the body parts.

07:01.367 --> 07:03.169
Well, come on, now.

07:03.203 --> 07:05.105
This woman was on trial
for murder

07:05.138 --> 07:06.172
and facing a conviction.

07:06.206 --> 07:09.576
Maybe she faked her death
in order to escape prison.

07:09.610 --> 07:11.477
We certainly considered that.

07:11.512 --> 07:13.146
But...

07:13.179 --> 07:16.049
Rachel Rosenblum weighed about
a hundred and thirty pounds.

07:16.082 --> 07:18.785
She'd have had about
3,500 cubic centimeters

07:18.819 --> 07:20.420
of blood in her body.

07:20.453 --> 07:22.155
By weighing the rug,

07:22.188 --> 07:25.526
we found that she lost
at least 1,700 ccs,

07:25.559 --> 07:27.160
almost half her blood.

07:27.193 --> 07:30.163
And that's not even accounting
for evaporation.

07:30.196 --> 07:32.065
It's almost impossible
to believe

07:32.098 --> 07:33.199
she could survive that.

07:33.233 --> 07:37.237
And why did you suspect
the defendant was involved?

07:37.270 --> 07:39.606
First of all, motive.

07:39.640 --> 07:41.141
She killed his brother.

07:42.175 --> 07:43.376
During the trial,

07:43.409 --> 07:45.846
he was extremely worried
that she'd be acquitted.

07:45.879 --> 07:47.447
WALSH: What else?

07:47.480 --> 07:49.149
SIMONS: Forensic evidence.

07:49.182 --> 07:51.351
We found hairs
on her living room floor

07:51.384 --> 07:53.386
soaked in Rachel's blood.

07:53.419 --> 07:56.557
Recent DNA testing show them
to be the defendant's.

07:57.658 --> 07:59.826
BERLUTI: This hair you found,

07:59.860 --> 08:02.402
Tom used to spend lots of time
in that house.

08:02.435 --> 08:04.404
It was his brother's house.

08:04.437 --> 08:07.107
By his own statement,
he hadn't been there in months.

08:07.140 --> 08:09.075
And the house
was regularly cleaned.

08:09.109 --> 08:11.211
Can you positively determine

08:11.244 --> 08:13.313
when that hair got
into the rug?

08:13.346 --> 08:14.214
No.

08:14.247 --> 08:14.815
BERLUTI: In fact,

08:14.848 --> 08:15.682
it could've been there

08:15.716 --> 08:18.418
for years before
Rachel disappeared.

08:18.451 --> 08:19.385
Unlikely.

08:19.419 --> 08:22.355
BERLUTI: And, detective,
police records show

08:22.388 --> 08:24.457
a series of break-ins
in Rachel's neighborhood

08:24.490 --> 08:26.159
around the time of her killing.

08:26.192 --> 08:28.294
None of which led
to anyone being killed.

08:28.328 --> 08:30.163
Can you positively rule out

08:30.196 --> 08:32.198
she could have been killed
by a burglar?

08:32.232 --> 08:35.101
It can't be positively
ruled out, but the likelihood--

08:35.135 --> 08:36.837
BERLUTI: Rachel knew
she could go away

08:36.870 --> 08:38.539
for up to 20 years, correct?

08:38.572 --> 08:39.339
That's right.

08:39.371 --> 08:41.808
BERLUTI: So,
she had a huge motive

08:41.842 --> 08:43.510
to fake her own death

08:43.544 --> 08:46.146
to keep from going to jail,
didn't she?

08:46.179 --> 08:49.249
Is it possible she could bleed
herself practically dry

08:49.282 --> 08:52.619
and rip out
one of her own teeth?

08:52.653 --> 08:54.054
Anything's possible.

08:55.756 --> 08:56.823
Thank you.

08:56.857 --> 08:58.191
No further questions.

09:05.438 --> 09:08.374
[indistinct chatter]

09:14.380 --> 09:16.750
Are you going to stew
all night?

09:16.783 --> 09:18.318
Maybe.

09:19.786 --> 09:20.787
I'm entitled.

09:26.326 --> 09:28.161
Could I be a dumb blonde
for a second

09:28.194 --> 09:31.031
and give my unsolicited opinion?

09:32.766 --> 09:35.636
Rather than sit there
feeling betrayed,

09:35.669 --> 09:37.337
you could look at it and say,

09:37.370 --> 09:40.807
"Gee, wow. Bobby picked me
as senior partner.

09:40.841 --> 09:41.842
What an honor."

09:41.875 --> 09:44.344
I don't look at it like that.

09:45.478 --> 09:48.181
Or, you could say,

09:48.214 --> 09:49.650
"Gee...

09:49.683 --> 09:52.118
this firm has been struggling
a little.

09:52.152 --> 09:54.354
New direction may be in order."

09:54.387 --> 09:56.690
Don't look at it
like that either.

09:56.723 --> 09:59.760
Or, you could say,

09:59.793 --> 10:02.102
"Gee, my friend

10:02.135 --> 10:03.637
must really be struggling.

10:04.705 --> 10:06.406
And instead of
feeling betrayed,

10:06.439 --> 10:08.374
maybe I should focus
on helping him."

10:13.246 --> 10:15.348
Failing all of the above,

10:15.381 --> 10:17.350
you could say, "Gee,

10:17.383 --> 10:20.486
everything she says
is so dumb.

10:20.521 --> 10:23.056
I'm having dinner
with a beautiful,

10:23.089 --> 10:25.291
dumb blonde.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.060
I bet she must be easy."

10:31.164 --> 10:33.834
So many silver linings,

10:33.867 --> 10:35.435
and the night is young.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.083
How's the trial going?

10:50.116 --> 10:51.084
Okay.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.256
Do you know
where you're going?

10:56.289 --> 10:56.890
(sighs)

10:56.923 --> 10:58.458
I'm gonna open an office.

11:00.801 --> 11:03.303
Solo practitioner
like the old days, I guess.

11:06.840 --> 11:08.575
Bec...

11:08.609 --> 11:11.778
(music playing)

11:12.345 --> 11:14.748
It isn't personal.

11:15.849 --> 11:17.250
You know that.

11:18.685 --> 11:19.686
I know that.

11:23.189 --> 11:24.625
Can I help with anything?

11:27.193 --> 11:28.061
No.

11:29.229 --> 11:31.264
I'm good.

11:31.297 --> 11:33.066
Okay.

11:35.368 --> 11:38.304
(music playing)

11:45.178 --> 11:47.648
I don't really owe you
an explanation, Lindsay.

11:47.681 --> 11:48.815
How can you say that?

11:48.849 --> 11:50.751
DONNELL: You don't even
live here anymore.

11:50.784 --> 11:53.119
This is a decision
I've made about my life.

11:53.153 --> 11:53.987
DOLE: What about income?

11:54.020 --> 11:56.189
What about the cost
of raising a child?

11:56.222 --> 11:58.124
That's why you're here?

11:58.158 --> 11:59.693
Money?
Yes, Bobby.

11:59.726 --> 12:01.467
You damn well know
I scratch right now.

12:01.502 --> 12:04.070
If this is some ploy
to avoid alimony then I--

12:04.104 --> 12:05.138
DONNELL: What?

12:05.171 --> 12:06.773
Don't you ever accuse me

12:06.807 --> 12:08.675
of doing this to avoid alimony.

12:08.709 --> 12:10.043
This is erratic behavior,
Bobby.

12:10.076 --> 12:11.645
You can't--
DONNELL: It's my life.

12:11.678 --> 12:12.813
Fine!

12:12.846 --> 12:14.114
Live your life.

12:18.084 --> 12:19.119
(door slams)

12:21.487 --> 12:24.157
WAYNE: I lived next door
to Rachel and Adrian.

12:24.190 --> 12:25.191
We were friends.

12:25.225 --> 12:27.794
How well did you know
the defendant, Tom Bartos?

12:27.828 --> 12:28.762
Pretty well.

12:28.795 --> 12:30.096
He was very close to his brother

12:30.130 --> 12:31.732
so he came around a fair bit.

12:31.765 --> 12:33.133
WALSH: Mrs. Wayne...

12:33.166 --> 12:35.068
on the day Rachel disappeared,

12:35.101 --> 12:37.838
did you notice anything
out of the ordinary?

12:37.871 --> 12:40.240
It was early in the morning.
I was out gardening

12:40.273 --> 12:42.709
and I saw someone
in her backyard.

12:42.743 --> 12:44.611
I looked through the fence

12:44.645 --> 12:45.746
and saw Tom.

12:45.779 --> 12:47.514
So, I called out to him.

12:47.548 --> 12:48.715
Did he respond?

12:48.749 --> 12:50.183
No.

12:50.216 --> 12:52.085
He turned
and walked away quickly.

12:52.118 --> 12:54.254
WALSH: You're positive
this was the morning

12:54.287 --> 12:55.321
she disappeared?

12:55.355 --> 12:57.157
Quite positive.

12:58.124 --> 13:00.233
BERLUTI: This man you called to,

13:00.266 --> 13:02.268
he didn't answer?
No.

13:02.302 --> 13:05.105
So you never heard his voice?
No.

13:05.138 --> 13:07.373
BERLUTI: And you didn't even see
this man's face

13:07.407 --> 13:09.075
straight on, did you?

13:09.109 --> 13:10.176
I saw a profile.

13:10.210 --> 13:11.812
Looking through the slats
of a fence?

13:11.845 --> 13:14.114
I also recognized his clothing.

13:14.147 --> 13:15.516
A black windbreaker and jeans?

13:15.549 --> 13:17.083
It was Tom.

13:17.117 --> 13:19.219
BERLUTI: Any idea how many
men in the Boston area

13:19.252 --> 13:22.689
own a black windbreaker
and jeans?

13:22.723 --> 13:24.124
It was Tom.

13:29.195 --> 13:31.464
That didn't go so great.

13:31.497 --> 13:33.634
It's still all circumstantial,
isn't it?

13:33.667 --> 13:36.202
It is, but...

13:37.504 --> 13:39.172
Assuming the jury believes

13:39.205 --> 13:41.074
he was there that morning--
I wasn't.

13:41.107 --> 13:43.109
WASHINGTON: But if the jury
believes it was you,

13:43.143 --> 13:45.445
and her testimony
was persuasive,

13:45.478 --> 13:47.247
we can't really explain it.

13:47.280 --> 13:49.115
So that gives them motive.

13:49.149 --> 13:50.517
Your DNA at the scene

13:50.551 --> 13:52.218
and you were seen at her house

13:52.252 --> 13:53.854
the morning she disappeared.

13:53.887 --> 13:55.789
It isn't good.

13:55.822 --> 13:57.658
BERLUTI: The point is,

13:57.691 --> 14:00.767
the offer of eight
might still be on the table.

14:00.801 --> 14:02.736
If things should go worse,

14:02.769 --> 14:04.070
they could pull it.

14:09.843 --> 14:12.078
I wanna play it out
a little longer.

14:13.780 --> 14:15.381
I have to.

14:18.852 --> 14:22.088
We log every flight
that takes off and lands.

14:22.122 --> 14:24.424
Mr. Bartos took up his plane
that afternoon

14:24.457 --> 14:26.492
and landed outside
Providence, Rhode Island.

14:26.527 --> 14:28.595
He was on the ground
only 30 minutes

14:28.629 --> 14:30.096
before flying back.

14:30.130 --> 14:32.198
WALSH: That's a short trip,
Mr. Woolrich?

14:32.232 --> 14:33.834
WOOLRICH: Yes,
shorter than his usual trips.

14:33.867 --> 14:36.737
WALSH: Mr. Woolrich,
did you observe the defendant

14:36.770 --> 14:39.806
loading anything into his plane
before he took off?

14:39.840 --> 14:42.275
Yes, I observed him loading
what appeared to be

14:42.308 --> 14:44.244
a large duffel bag
into the cabin.

14:44.277 --> 14:45.245
He struggled with it.

14:45.278 --> 14:47.113
It seemed to be very heavy.

14:47.147 --> 14:48.582
WALSH: And did you have
an opportunity

14:48.615 --> 14:51.618
to observe whether he unloaded
the duffel bag

14:51.652 --> 14:52.553
after he landed?

14:52.586 --> 14:55.722
There was no duffel bag
when he came back.

14:58.458 --> 15:00.133
It's adding up.

15:00.166 --> 15:01.267
And the problem is,

15:01.301 --> 15:04.137
we have nothing
to stack up against it.

15:04.170 --> 15:05.371
Could I take the stand?

15:07.373 --> 15:08.642
As a character witness.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.376
Marcie...

15:10.410 --> 15:12.078
until six months ago,

15:12.112 --> 15:14.380
you thought your husband's name
was Dan Sterling.

15:14.414 --> 15:17.684
What kind of character witness
would you really be

15:17.718 --> 15:20.353
if you didn't even know
his true identity?

15:20.386 --> 15:22.322
TOM: Marcie...

15:22.355 --> 15:24.190
could I have a second, please?

15:25.425 --> 15:26.693
Why?

15:26.727 --> 15:29.162
I just need a second
with Jimmy and Rebecca.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.198
Okay.

15:37.337 --> 15:38.672
What's going on?

15:41.407 --> 15:43.243
I haven't been
totally up-front.

15:46.847 --> 15:48.281
I think she's alive.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.151
Who?

15:52.819 --> 15:53.587
Rachel.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.822
BERLUTI: Rachel?

15:55.856 --> 15:57.223
The victim?

15:58.224 --> 15:59.092
Yeah.

15:59.125 --> 16:01.034
You know this how?

16:02.836 --> 16:05.171
I helped her fake her death
and get out of Boston.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.642
I beg your pardon?

16:10.677 --> 16:12.212
I was having an affair
with her.

16:13.479 --> 16:15.181
In fact...

16:15.215 --> 16:17.050
I loved her.

16:17.083 --> 16:18.484
That's why I was freaking out
at the trial.

16:18.519 --> 16:19.820
I was worried
she'd be convicted.

16:19.853 --> 16:21.522
I was acting angry to cover.

16:21.555 --> 16:23.790
I mean, if the cops had known
we were having an affair,

16:23.824 --> 16:25.559
they would've used that
against her.

16:25.592 --> 16:27.227
BERLUTI: Okay.

16:27.260 --> 16:28.161
Slow down.

16:28.194 --> 16:31.064
You were in love
with your brother's wife?

16:31.097 --> 16:32.165
TOM: My brother was a bastard.

16:34.835 --> 16:37.838
He used to beat her

16:37.871 --> 16:39.105
when he had a few beers in him,

16:39.139 --> 16:41.141
which was practically
every night.

16:41.875 --> 16:44.444
I was gonna take her away
from him.

16:44.477 --> 16:46.179
And he found out
and came at her.

16:46.212 --> 16:48.815
And that is why she stabbed him,

16:48.849 --> 16:50.584
in self-defense.

16:52.218 --> 16:53.419
So where is she now?

16:55.121 --> 16:56.222
I don't know.

16:57.758 --> 16:58.759
She left me.

16:58.792 --> 17:01.034
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

17:01.067 --> 17:03.804
TOM: We lived together
for about eight months

17:03.837 --> 17:05.638
under separate identities.

17:06.707 --> 17:08.040
Afterwards, she split.

17:11.111 --> 17:13.445
Given she was convicted
in Adrian's murder,

17:13.479 --> 17:15.214
I don't--

17:15.248 --> 17:17.317
I don't figure her
to be coming back.

17:17.349 --> 17:20.286
(music playing)

17:25.826 --> 17:28.161
Will you send my wife in now,
please?

17:30.296 --> 17:32.332
(sighs) I guess it's time
I tell her.

17:38.138 --> 17:39.439
Do you believe him?

17:39.472 --> 17:40.807
Actually, I do,

17:40.841 --> 17:42.275
as crazy as it sounds.

17:42.308 --> 17:44.144
They faked her death together?

17:44.177 --> 17:47.113
So she could escape prison.

17:47.147 --> 17:48.515
The question is,

17:48.549 --> 17:51.217
do we let him get on the stand
and tell his story?

17:51.251 --> 17:52.085
That is risky.

17:52.118 --> 17:53.754
WASHINGTON:
But if we believed him,

17:53.787 --> 17:54.755
so might the jury.

17:54.788 --> 17:57.423
And at this point,
we've got nothing to lose.

17:57.457 --> 18:00.033
Why didn't he come forward
with this before?

18:00.066 --> 18:01.001
WASHINGTON: Good question.

18:01.034 --> 18:03.203
He probably figured
nobody would swallow it.

18:03.236 --> 18:05.405
YOUNG: Which is maybe
why you don't let him testify.

18:05.438 --> 18:07.574
BERLUTI: Look,
we got to get back, Eugene.

18:07.608 --> 18:09.342
What's this meeting about?

18:12.378 --> 18:13.614
It's about Bobby,

18:13.647 --> 18:15.716
or this firm without Bobby.

18:15.749 --> 18:17.684
Whether he changes his mind
or not,

18:17.718 --> 18:19.786
right now, it seems made up,

18:19.820 --> 18:22.488
which means we need
to get used to life quickly

18:22.523 --> 18:24.525
around here without him.

18:24.558 --> 18:27.561
Ellenor and I have formed
an ad hoc management committee.

18:27.594 --> 18:30.731
We will be deciding whether
to accept or reject cases.

18:30.764 --> 18:33.233
That's effective immediately.
Wait a second.

18:33.266 --> 18:34.801
Look, we can't do it
by committee, Jimmy.

18:34.835 --> 18:36.436
And truth be told,

18:36.469 --> 18:38.772
you're the biggest offender
for taking dogs.

18:38.805 --> 18:40.741
Hey.
On a more positive note,

18:40.774 --> 18:43.043
we've elected you
to be a full partner.

18:44.244 --> 18:45.078
Oh.

18:45.111 --> 18:47.080
Who elected?

18:47.113 --> 18:49.716
YOUNG: Well, with my two votes
and Ellenor's one,

18:49.750 --> 18:50.684
we didn't need yours,

18:50.717 --> 18:52.819
though I'm sure
you would've given it to us.

18:52.853 --> 18:55.121
Is this how you plan
to run the ship, Eugene?

18:56.757 --> 18:58.759
Here's the biggie,

18:58.792 --> 19:01.067
if Bobby's gone,

19:01.101 --> 19:03.136
I say we get Lindsay back.

19:03.169 --> 19:04.605
Excuse me?

19:04.638 --> 19:05.405
YOUNG: She wasn't leaving us

19:05.438 --> 19:07.373
so much as she was him and--
Whoa!

19:07.407 --> 19:10.143
YOUNG: She has the best
civil reputation of all of us.

19:10.176 --> 19:12.646
If you bring her in,
Bobby will never come back!

19:12.679 --> 19:14.047
We can't be held hostage

19:14.080 --> 19:16.116
by Bobby's mid-life meltdown,
Rebecca.

19:16.149 --> 19:18.752
We have to be decisive now.

19:18.785 --> 19:20.120
And, yes,

19:20.153 --> 19:21.555
this is how I plan to lead.

19:24.124 --> 19:27.460
All those in favor of extending
an offer to Lindsay.

19:37.370 --> 19:38.371
Good.

19:40.473 --> 19:41.675
How hostile is that?

19:41.708 --> 19:42.509
YOUNG: It's not hostile.

19:42.543 --> 19:45.078
You plan to invite
my ex-wife in here?

19:45.111 --> 19:46.112
You're not gonna be here,
Bobby.

19:46.146 --> 19:47.380
It shouldn't matter
what we do.

19:47.413 --> 19:48.715
DONNELL: What matters
is getting a deliberate

19:48.749 --> 19:49.716
slap in the face
when somebody's--

19:49.750 --> 19:51.852
Try a punch in the gut.
That's what you did.

19:51.885 --> 19:53.186
I made a decision.

19:53.219 --> 19:54.320
YOUNG: So did I.

19:54.354 --> 19:56.222
In the best interest
of this firm.

19:56.256 --> 19:58.491
When's the last time
you did that?

19:58.525 --> 20:00.033
When's the last time
you did that?

20:01.134 --> 20:02.536
You need to move on, Bobby,

20:02.569 --> 20:03.537
well, so do we.

20:03.570 --> 20:06.039
And if you really do care
about our future,

20:06.072 --> 20:08.141
you better hope to God
we get Lindsay

20:08.174 --> 20:10.410
because she's the best
available lawyer out there.

20:10.443 --> 20:12.178
Yeah, walk out,
just keep walking out doors.

20:12.212 --> 20:13.313
This is the thanks I get

20:13.346 --> 20:14.581
for giving the firm to you?

20:14.615 --> 20:15.682
YOUNG: Thanks for what,
for leaving?

20:15.716 --> 20:16.750
All right.
That's enough!

20:16.783 --> 20:18.151
Ten years...

20:18.184 --> 20:20.120
I put in this firm
with you, by your side,

20:20.153 --> 20:23.389
and not just to build a practice
of law, ten years.

20:28.461 --> 20:29.696
Thanks for nothing.

20:31.231 --> 20:33.634
(music playing)

20:38.138 --> 20:41.207
I have way, way too many
changes going on right now

20:41.241 --> 20:43.076
to even consider this.

20:45.478 --> 20:47.113
I'm flattered but--

20:47.147 --> 20:49.182
Might you consider it

20:49.215 --> 20:50.250
down the road some?

20:52.385 --> 20:54.187
FRUTT: We're serious
about developing

20:54.220 --> 20:56.156
our civil practice here,
Lindsay.

20:56.189 --> 20:58.091
We'd like you to do it.

21:03.469 --> 21:06.573
If I were to even
entertain the idea,

21:06.607 --> 21:08.074
Claire comes with me.

21:09.375 --> 21:10.611
We'd love to have her.

21:12.646 --> 21:14.114
Well, like I said,
I can't think

21:14.147 --> 21:16.149
about any more change
right now,

21:17.350 --> 21:18.585
but...

21:18.619 --> 21:21.555
(music playing)

21:23.724 --> 21:25.659
Are you okay?

21:25.692 --> 21:26.593
Yeah.

21:26.627 --> 21:28.394
Yeah. I, um...

21:30.664 --> 21:32.566
I feel a little adrift.

21:34.467 --> 21:36.269
I guess the idea
of coming home.

21:37.804 --> 21:38.772
I, um...

21:40.206 --> 21:41.474
YOUNG: Then do that, Lindsay.

21:43.143 --> 21:44.377
Come back home.

21:46.179 --> 21:47.781
I got to go, okay?

21:47.814 --> 21:49.550
Thanks.

22:01.434 --> 22:03.670
We knew about the break-ins
in the neighborhood.

22:03.704 --> 22:05.338
We wanted it to seem

22:05.371 --> 22:06.773
like she had surprised
the burglar,

22:06.807 --> 22:08.141
he'd killed her

22:08.174 --> 22:09.610
and hid the body.

22:09.643 --> 22:11.311
What about all the blood?

22:11.344 --> 22:12.813
Rachel used to work as a nurse.

22:12.846 --> 22:15.081
She'd taken blood many times.

22:15.115 --> 22:17.317
We wanted it to look good,

22:17.350 --> 22:19.419
so she started taking vials
of her own blood

22:19.452 --> 22:21.154
for a couple of weeks.

22:21.187 --> 22:23.356
We kept it
in her refrigerator,

22:23.389 --> 22:24.324
and when we had enough...

22:24.825 --> 22:26.459
And her teeth?

22:26.492 --> 22:28.428
She had some anesthetic

22:28.461 --> 22:30.396
she took from the hospital.

22:30.430 --> 22:32.298
We injected it

22:32.332 --> 22:33.166
in her gums

22:33.199 --> 22:35.068
and pulled out
one of her back teeth

22:35.101 --> 22:36.336
with a pair of pliers.

22:36.369 --> 22:38.104
She mutilated herself?

22:38.138 --> 22:41.508
Oh, if we hadn't made it look
like she was really dead...

22:41.542 --> 22:42.809
BERLUTI: And the airplane trip?

22:43.476 --> 22:44.678
Helping her escape.

22:44.711 --> 22:46.647
I flew her up to Providence,

22:46.680 --> 22:48.214
dropped her off,
and came back.

22:48.248 --> 22:50.183
BERLUTI: So she was actually

22:50.216 --> 22:51.317
in the duffel bag?

22:51.351 --> 22:52.819
But alive.

22:52.853 --> 22:56.523
She took a bus
from Providence to Atlanta.

22:56.557 --> 22:57.858
I was gonna wait
until things cooled down,

22:57.891 --> 23:00.133
then I was gonna move
out of town and join her.

23:00.166 --> 23:01.167
But?

23:01.201 --> 23:03.403
Basically,

23:03.436 --> 23:05.672
I blew it.
The neighbor saw me,

23:05.706 --> 23:08.441
I didn't even know about DNA,

23:08.474 --> 23:10.110
my hairs in her blood.

23:11.111 --> 23:12.178
Then when the police phoned,

23:12.212 --> 23:13.514
I knew I was about
to get arrested,

23:13.547 --> 23:15.448
so I...

23:15.481 --> 23:17.784
I took off and joined her.
Then what?

23:17.818 --> 23:20.754
We hid out together
for about eight months,

23:20.787 --> 23:22.556
paying in cash,
staying in motels.

23:22.589 --> 23:25.058
We kept entirely to ourselves.

23:25.091 --> 23:27.093
We...

23:27.127 --> 23:28.161
we moved every week.

23:30.263 --> 23:32.599
And then, one day,

23:32.633 --> 23:34.701
she couldn't take it anymore,

23:34.735 --> 23:36.036
and she left me.

23:38.338 --> 23:40.674
And I never saw her again.

23:40.707 --> 23:42.175
When was that?

23:42.208 --> 23:44.144
Nine plus years ago.

23:47.180 --> 23:48.715
I got a new I. D.,

23:48.749 --> 23:50.617
a new name.

23:50.651 --> 23:52.786
I started getting
regular work in telecom.

23:54.220 --> 23:55.255
And five years ago,

23:55.288 --> 23:57.123
I settled
outside of Los Angeles.

23:58.358 --> 24:00.767
And a year later,

24:00.801 --> 24:02.002
I met my wife, Marcie.

24:03.203 --> 24:04.738
We worked together
at the phone company.

24:05.839 --> 24:07.741
We have a beautiful
baby daughter.

24:07.774 --> 24:09.710
BERLUTI: Tom,

24:09.743 --> 24:13.113
you sat on this lie

24:13.146 --> 24:15.048
for nine-plus years.

24:15.081 --> 24:18.418
I know. I should never
have helped Rachel escape.

24:18.451 --> 24:21.087
I know it now, and I am sorry.

24:21.121 --> 24:23.123
I should be condemned
for that behavior,

24:23.156 --> 24:25.191
but I did not kill her.

24:26.459 --> 24:28.194
She is out there.

24:29.863 --> 24:31.431
Somewhere.

24:31.464 --> 24:33.033
Thank you.

24:41.174 --> 24:42.308
Objection!

24:42.342 --> 24:43.677
I'm sorry,

24:43.710 --> 24:45.712
but I thought I'd seen
and heard it all.

24:45.746 --> 24:47.614
Objection!
Sustained.

24:47.648 --> 24:48.582
It's the truth.

24:48.615 --> 24:49.850
It's the truth,

24:49.883 --> 24:51.117
what you just said?

24:51.151 --> 24:52.285
Yes.

24:52.318 --> 24:54.254
Well then,

24:54.287 --> 24:55.388
I'll drop the charges.

24:55.421 --> 24:57.558
Mr. Walsh.

24:57.591 --> 24:59.760
Show me a photograph
of the two of you together

24:59.793 --> 25:02.102
taken after she disappeared.

25:02.135 --> 25:03.469
That would be a help.

25:03.504 --> 25:04.738
We didn't take any pictures.

25:04.771 --> 25:06.139
Not one?

25:06.172 --> 25:08.108
We were fugitives,
Mr. Walsh.

25:08.141 --> 25:10.110
We were a little camera-shy.

25:10.143 --> 25:12.245
How about a witness?

25:12.278 --> 25:14.715
Someone who saw her alive?

25:16.382 --> 25:18.218
You were together
for eight months.

25:18.251 --> 25:20.086
Someone must have seen you.

25:20.120 --> 25:22.222
A motel clerk, a waiter.

25:22.255 --> 25:24.057
You must have some evidence

25:24.090 --> 25:25.592
to show you were having
an affair with her.

25:25.626 --> 25:26.760
The point of an affair

25:26.793 --> 25:28.094
is that it's secret.

25:29.462 --> 25:31.497
You ripped out Rachel's teeth

25:31.532 --> 25:33.199
with pliers

25:33.233 --> 25:35.268
and stored vials of her blood

25:35.301 --> 25:37.170
in her refrigerator?
Yes.

25:37.203 --> 25:39.072
Got the pliers?

25:39.105 --> 25:40.106
The empty anesthetic jars?

25:40.140 --> 25:41.441
You're asking me for evidence

25:41.474 --> 25:43.610
we were deliberately
trying to get rid of!

25:43.644 --> 25:45.812
So, basically,
all we've got to go on here

25:45.846 --> 25:47.113
is your good word.

25:47.147 --> 25:48.549
TOM: Yes.

25:48.582 --> 25:50.216
WALSH: You admit
lying to the police

25:50.250 --> 25:51.852
about your relationship
with the victim?

25:51.885 --> 25:53.486
Yes.

25:53.520 --> 25:56.189
Lying about your very name
for 10 years?

25:56.222 --> 25:57.190
I had to.

25:57.223 --> 25:59.392
Lying even to your own wife.

26:01.401 --> 26:02.435
Yes.

26:02.468 --> 26:04.605
But now,

26:04.638 --> 26:06.239
when you're looking at 20 years

26:06.272 --> 26:08.208
behind bars,

26:08.241 --> 26:10.310
now...

26:10.343 --> 26:12.078
we should believe you.

26:30.597 --> 26:33.133
Is eight still on the table?

26:33.166 --> 26:33.834
No,

26:33.867 --> 26:36.136
I just tried to float it.

26:36.169 --> 26:37.638
Walsh laughed.

26:39.105 --> 26:41.307
WASHINGTON: Do you have any idea

26:41.341 --> 26:44.110
as to where Rachel
could possibly be?

26:44.144 --> 26:46.179
If we can show she's alive--

26:48.381 --> 26:50.416
did she ever mention
a favorite town

26:50.450 --> 26:52.619
or place she'd like to go?

26:52.653 --> 26:54.054
I don't remember anything.

26:55.522 --> 26:58.091
But I don't really
wanna lead them to her anyway.

26:59.693 --> 27:00.601
Sorry?

27:00.634 --> 27:01.768
I just don't.

27:01.802 --> 27:04.104
Look,

27:04.137 --> 27:06.707
I started a new life, and...

27:06.740 --> 27:08.609
she probably did, too.

27:08.642 --> 27:09.710
She likely has a family,

27:09.743 --> 27:11.077
and I don't wanna put
her through

27:11.111 --> 27:13.514
what I'm going through
right now.

27:13.547 --> 27:15.749
Are you serious?

27:15.782 --> 27:18.451
You have sacrificed everything
for this woman.

27:18.484 --> 27:21.121
Marcie,
could you excuse us again?

27:23.123 --> 27:25.225
Marcie, please.

27:25.258 --> 27:27.393
I need to have a conversation
with my client.

27:35.869 --> 27:37.370
You know where she is,
don't you?

27:39.372 --> 27:40.541
No.

27:42.275 --> 27:44.344
How can you sit quiet?
You're about--

27:44.377 --> 27:47.147
TOM: Because I love her!

27:47.180 --> 27:48.815
I'm sorry.
I know it's sick, but I do.

27:48.849 --> 27:51.084
I still love her,
and she still...

27:51.117 --> 27:53.319
She still what?

27:53.353 --> 27:54.555
She still loves you?

27:58.892 --> 28:00.466
Are you two still together?

28:02.268 --> 28:04.204
No.
Look,

28:04.237 --> 28:06.607
all we need is evidence
she's alive.

28:06.640 --> 28:08.174
She doesn't need
to come forward.

28:08.208 --> 28:10.210
If the police become convinced

28:10.243 --> 28:11.377
that she is alive,

28:11.411 --> 28:13.747
they will hunt her down.

28:13.780 --> 28:15.181
And I won't let her--

28:16.850 --> 28:18.785
this is privilege.

28:18.819 --> 28:20.787
You can't tell Marcie
any of this.

28:20.821 --> 28:23.624
BERLUTI: Tom, if Rachel loves
you as you say--

28:23.657 --> 28:25.358
TOM: Jimmy!

28:25.391 --> 28:27.393
I will not let her
come forward.

28:43.376 --> 28:44.711
I'm so incredibly sorry.

28:46.513 --> 28:48.615
I know how difficult
this must be for you.

28:49.382 --> 28:52.218
And my coming to you
screaming about money or--

28:52.252 --> 28:54.420
it was just out of line,
and I apologize.

28:58.825 --> 29:00.300
That having been said,

29:02.503 --> 29:04.037
do not walk out
on these people

29:04.070 --> 29:05.772
without talking to them, Bobby.

29:08.108 --> 29:09.242
They love you.

29:13.146 --> 29:15.081
This practice first,

29:15.115 --> 29:16.783
fundamentally,

29:16.817 --> 29:19.085
always is you.

29:31.231 --> 29:32.432
(door closes)

29:33.834 --> 29:35.168
STRINGER: I guess
I just don't get

29:35.201 --> 29:38.071
the depth of your hurt here.

29:38.104 --> 29:39.172
I mean,

29:39.205 --> 29:41.241
he's quitting a job,

29:41.274 --> 29:42.609
not a friendship.

29:43.443 --> 29:46.747
Our relationship was the job.

29:46.780 --> 29:48.148
If you really believed that,

29:48.181 --> 29:49.583
you wouldn't feel so betrayed.

29:49.616 --> 29:52.152
I've been seeing the man
almost every day

29:52.185 --> 29:55.088
for my entire adult life, Jamie.

29:55.121 --> 29:57.490
When he leaves,
we won't be seeing each other.

29:57.524 --> 29:59.125
I mean, we'll talk a good game,

29:59.159 --> 30:01.034
"Let's get together.
Let's grab a beer."

30:01.067 --> 30:03.103
But that won't happen.

30:03.136 --> 30:04.771
It'll be over.

30:04.805 --> 30:06.807
STRINGER: Have you ever wondered
if you're able

30:06.840 --> 30:08.308
to sustain a relationship

30:08.341 --> 30:10.043
outside of work?

30:10.076 --> 30:12.245
I mean maybe Bobby
won't be much good at it.

30:12.278 --> 30:14.114
He failed with Lindsay,

30:14.147 --> 30:17.050
but...

30:17.083 --> 30:18.418
I think it's your track record

30:18.451 --> 30:20.453
that scares you so.

30:20.486 --> 30:23.223
I'm able to have a relationship
outside of work.

30:23.256 --> 30:25.792
Really?

30:25.826 --> 30:27.393
When's the last time?

30:30.130 --> 30:32.232
I believe I'm having one now.

30:35.301 --> 30:37.437
Well, I can't be sure,

30:37.470 --> 30:39.172
but I think...

30:39.205 --> 30:42.042
you actually just said
something nice.

30:44.110 --> 30:46.379
Nice.

30:46.412 --> 30:47.581
I'm capable of that, too.

30:47.614 --> 30:49.716
STRINGER: (laughing)
I'll believe that

30:49.750 --> 30:51.051
when I see it.

31:01.134 --> 31:02.435
How was that?

31:04.104 --> 31:05.005
It's a start.

31:19.452 --> 31:21.688
BERLUTI: You gotta help me
make sense of this, Tom.

31:22.823 --> 31:25.258
You could spend the rest
of your life

31:25.291 --> 31:26.226
in prison.

31:28.428 --> 31:30.731
I love her, Jimmy.

31:30.764 --> 31:32.566
Don't get me wrong,
I love Marcie, too.

31:32.599 --> 31:34.467
We have a--
we have a nice family.

31:34.500 --> 31:35.569
Yes.

31:35.602 --> 31:37.203
You have a daughter

31:37.237 --> 31:39.372
who needs to grow up
with a father.

31:42.108 --> 31:44.377
If Rachel could just reveal

31:44.410 --> 31:45.612
she's alive without--

31:45.646 --> 31:46.847
She has a murder conviction

31:46.880 --> 31:48.715
hanging over her.

31:48.749 --> 31:50.450
They'd find her.
BERLUTI: Not necessarily.

31:50.483 --> 31:53.186
I said no, Jimmy,
and I mean no.

31:56.189 --> 31:58.491
I am willing
to go down for her.

31:58.525 --> 31:59.626
And if you can't understand

31:59.660 --> 32:02.368
how a person could love
somebody enough to do that,

32:04.805 --> 32:06.773
well, that's just too bad
for you, I guess.

32:16.249 --> 32:19.152
Did he say
what this one was about?

32:19.185 --> 32:20.220
I didn't question him.

32:20.253 --> 32:21.822
FRUTT: Because you were just
happy to be invited.

32:21.855 --> 32:24.090
Exactly.

32:24.124 --> 32:25.526
What's he doing?

32:25.559 --> 32:27.260
He's closing.
Oh.

32:27.293 --> 32:28.829
Hey,

32:28.862 --> 32:30.163
thanks for coming in here again.

32:35.869 --> 32:37.704
Eugene, Lindsay,

32:37.738 --> 32:40.106
I guess everybody feels

32:40.140 --> 32:41.675
I owe an explanation.

32:43.577 --> 32:46.146
But it presumes I have one

32:46.179 --> 32:48.114
when...

32:48.148 --> 32:51.117
all I can tell you
is I basically grew up

32:51.151 --> 32:52.719
in a big firm.

32:52.753 --> 32:54.420
You all know this.

32:54.454 --> 32:55.822
My dad was a custodian

32:55.856 --> 32:57.223
in one of those
blue-chip offices

32:57.257 --> 32:58.625
across the street.

33:01.735 --> 33:03.637
And I wanted
to be like those lawyers.

33:04.771 --> 33:07.107
And all the while, I...

33:07.140 --> 33:08.642
hated them

33:08.675 --> 33:10.410
for the way they treated
my father.

33:11.712 --> 33:14.247
And I suppose I've been caught
in that paradox.

33:15.516 --> 33:17.250
Wanting to become...

33:18.785 --> 33:21.121
the monster...

33:21.154 --> 33:22.255
I hated.

33:25.626 --> 33:26.793
Started off solo, just me

33:26.827 --> 33:29.495
with Rebecca as my assistant,

33:29.530 --> 33:31.231
vowing...

33:31.264 --> 33:33.634
to myself to make my firm

33:33.667 --> 33:35.168
into the one across the street.

33:35.201 --> 33:38.071
And to a large extent,

33:38.104 --> 33:39.372
I've done that.

33:41.274 --> 33:42.342
I work with a group,

33:46.680 --> 33:48.181
the finest...

33:48.214 --> 33:49.683
group of lawyers...

33:51.351 --> 33:53.453
I could ever imagine.

33:56.723 --> 33:58.291
But at the end of the day,

34:00.734 --> 34:02.202
I just can't go to work

34:02.235 --> 34:04.204
across the street anymore.

34:07.373 --> 34:09.610
I need...

34:09.643 --> 34:12.045
to be...

34:12.078 --> 34:14.447
alone,

34:14.480 --> 34:17.250
taking cases I wanna take.

34:20.320 --> 34:22.487
I love each
and every one of you.

34:26.359 --> 34:27.661
Eugene,

34:29.596 --> 34:31.532
Ellenor,

34:31.565 --> 34:34.199
Jimmy,

34:34.234 --> 34:37.036
you are my best friends.

34:38.138 --> 34:40.106
Rebecca,
I won't even begin to describe

34:40.139 --> 34:41.341
how I feel about you,

34:41.373 --> 34:43.109
and I don't think I have to.

34:44.844 --> 34:47.112
Lucy,

34:47.147 --> 34:49.716
you've been like a daughter.

34:49.750 --> 34:51.251
An obnoxious one.

34:53.219 --> 34:54.855
And, Jamie,
I'm only at the beginning

34:54.888 --> 34:57.090
of getting to know you,

34:57.123 --> 34:58.291
but...

35:00.534 --> 35:01.702
I gotta go.

35:04.204 --> 35:07.040
I wish I could offer a more
satisfactory answer than--

35:11.311 --> 35:12.579
I've been...

35:12.613 --> 35:14.414
very destructive lately,

35:15.782 --> 35:17.050
breaking free of my marriage

35:17.083 --> 35:19.352
when what maybe I really wanted

35:19.385 --> 35:21.622
was to just break free.

35:24.357 --> 35:26.092
But some days you wake up,

35:28.862 --> 35:30.564
and you just know.

35:34.701 --> 35:36.136
It's time.

35:40.641 --> 35:41.708
I gotta go.

35:46.680 --> 35:48.114
Love you.

35:49.449 --> 35:51.552
(footsteps departing)

35:55.155 --> 35:58.091
(music playing)

36:16.416 --> 36:18.018
I just, uh...

36:36.169 --> 36:37.137
Love you, too, man.

36:45.178 --> 36:47.280
What's going on?

36:47.313 --> 36:49.182
GAMBLE: Well,

36:49.215 --> 36:50.517
Kenneth asked me to be here

36:50.551 --> 36:52.385
because he's unable to talk.

36:53.153 --> 36:55.789
What do you mean
"he's unable to talk"?

36:55.822 --> 36:57.123
He's too upset.

36:58.525 --> 37:01.400
Last night, he received
in the mail this bottle

37:01.434 --> 37:02.769
with an anonymous note

37:02.802 --> 37:05.071
asking him to run it for prints,

37:05.104 --> 37:06.239
which he did.

37:06.740 --> 37:11.044
We lifted three fresh prints

37:11.077 --> 37:12.779
belonging to Rachel Rosenblum.

37:14.413 --> 37:15.582
As you can see,

37:15.615 --> 37:17.651
this is a fairly new bottle,

37:17.684 --> 37:20.486
which means,
at least as of three months ago,

37:20.521 --> 37:22.122
the supposed victim

37:22.155 --> 37:23.023
was alive.

37:23.990 --> 37:26.793
Accordingly,
the prosecution has no choice

37:26.827 --> 37:29.029
but to dismiss the complaint.

37:30.163 --> 37:32.733
Now, I've tried to tell Kenneth

37:32.766 --> 37:34.668
this is a good thing.

37:34.701 --> 37:37.237
A terrible miscarriage
of justice

37:37.270 --> 37:38.839
has been avoided but--

37:38.872 --> 37:42.075
well, he refuses
to see it that way.

37:42.108 --> 37:44.077
In any event,

37:44.110 --> 37:45.779
your client is off the hook.

37:47.714 --> 37:49.716
Now, he will face charges

37:49.750 --> 37:51.384
of obstruction of justice

37:51.417 --> 37:53.386
for faking this woman's death.

37:56.489 --> 37:57.691
It's over?

37:57.724 --> 38:00.100
On the murder charge.

38:00.133 --> 38:01.602
On the other,

38:01.635 --> 38:02.603
they'll prosecute.

38:05.171 --> 38:07.340
Well, did they say
how much time I'd get?

38:07.373 --> 38:10.143
No. Faking a person's death,

38:10.176 --> 38:11.444
I'd have to look it up.

38:11.477 --> 38:12.746
You might make bail.

38:12.779 --> 38:15.448
I can't believe she sent it in.

38:15.481 --> 38:18.418
I--I can't believe it.

38:18.451 --> 38:20.721
WASHINGTON:
I don't think she did.

38:20.754 --> 38:23.189
But, hey, let's ask her.

38:25.826 --> 38:27.360
Did you send it in, Rachel?

38:29.863 --> 38:32.232
I detected the resemblance
right away

38:32.265 --> 38:34.334
but thought men just fall
for a certain look.

38:34.367 --> 38:35.736
It's not surprising
you should look a little

38:35.769 --> 38:37.604
like his last love.

38:37.638 --> 38:38.204
But then

38:38.238 --> 38:41.141
I started to look closer.

38:41.174 --> 38:43.076
Lose some weight,

38:43.109 --> 38:44.578
plastic surgery,

38:44.611 --> 38:47.113
new nose, new hair

38:47.147 --> 38:48.815
but most of it's still there.

38:50.751 --> 38:52.152
What are you talking about?

38:53.319 --> 38:55.221
Meet Rachel Rosenblum, Jimmy.

39:00.567 --> 39:03.036
The reason Tom didn't want
to give her up.

39:03.069 --> 39:04.470
She's the mother of his child.

39:07.173 --> 39:08.141
I sent the bottle in.

39:10.811 --> 39:12.478
You drank out of it yesterday.

39:14.648 --> 39:16.449
That is privilege.

39:16.482 --> 39:17.350
You're my lawyer.

39:17.383 --> 39:19.753
I'm his lawyer, not yours.

39:21.321 --> 39:23.356
You're Rachel?

39:27.661 --> 39:29.362
What are you gonna do?

39:30.163 --> 39:32.566
Enough of this does fall
within his privilege.

39:32.599 --> 39:33.634
Your secret's safe.

39:36.570 --> 39:38.672
You, on the other hand,
might not be.

39:40.741 --> 39:42.776
Your wife kills husbands

39:44.144 --> 39:45.411
but you knew that.

40:05.772 --> 40:07.541
Everyone said
you left hours ago.

40:09.275 --> 40:10.476
Yeah.

40:10.511 --> 40:12.713
I wanted to...

40:12.746 --> 40:14.014
do this alone.

40:15.682 --> 40:16.482
Okay.

40:21.387 --> 40:22.188
Go for a drink?

40:26.192 --> 40:28.494
Bobby,

40:28.529 --> 40:31.264
you basically now have...

40:31.297 --> 40:32.332
nowhere to call home.

40:32.365 --> 40:34.300
And maybe that's what you want,

40:35.769 --> 40:38.371
but before you adjourn
to your...

40:38.404 --> 40:40.707
big, empty world,

40:40.741 --> 40:42.075
let me buy you a drink.

40:44.144 --> 40:45.178
Okay.

40:47.413 --> 40:48.549
I'll wait outside.

41:17.217 --> 41:18.284
I take it you won.

41:21.287 --> 41:22.589
This is good.
DOLE: Good?

41:22.623 --> 41:25.158
I didn't go to law school
to put drug dealers

41:25.191 --> 41:27.327
back on the street.

41:27.360 --> 41:29.295
The criminal practice

41:29.329 --> 41:31.064
helps us to pay the rent
and allows us to--

41:31.097 --> 41:33.333
Rent! We're late with the rent.

41:33.366 --> 41:34.701
We don't even have
a conference table.

41:34.735 --> 41:35.836
We'll never build civil.

41:35.869 --> 41:38.438
The last blue-chip I brought in
tripped over a box.

41:38.471 --> 41:40.741
And now he's suing us.
This is a dump.

41:41.708 --> 41:44.110
You don't think I want us in one
of those high-rise buildings?

41:45.411 --> 41:46.680
We'll get there,

41:46.713 --> 41:48.815
five years from now,
nice lobby,

41:48.849 --> 41:50.651
spacious offices.

41:52.285 --> 41:54.120
Come on. That's gonna be us.

41:56.422 --> 41:57.223
Okay.

42:18.084 --> 42:19.786
DONNELL: I'm shutting down
the practice.

42:19.820 --> 42:22.155
Get your resumes out there.
I'll try to string out

42:22.188 --> 42:23.289
three more weeks.
WASHINGTON: That's fine.

42:23.323 --> 42:25.158
You have a suppression hearing
scheduled in 12 minutes.

42:25.191 --> 42:26.760
DONNELL: You see this?
What?

42:26.793 --> 42:29.095
Huh? Eviction notice!

42:29.129 --> 42:30.597
These are the kinds of things
that happen

42:30.631 --> 42:31.532
when you can't make the rent,

42:31.565 --> 42:33.433
which is the kind of thing
you can't make

42:33.466 --> 42:36.069
when clients don't pay.

42:36.102 --> 42:37.370
Are we anywhere close
to a settlement

42:37.403 --> 42:38.605
on the tobacco case? Tell me.

42:38.639 --> 42:40.674
WASHINGTON: Ha.
We're shutting down again.

42:40.707 --> 42:42.208
YOUNG: Oh, that's nice.
Any decaffeinated?

42:42.242 --> 42:43.043
DONNELL: I'm serious.
I've had it.

42:43.076 --> 42:44.611
We can't keep
juggling like this.

42:44.645 --> 42:46.079
You haven't had it.
Don't tell me you've had it

42:46.112 --> 42:47.247
when you haven't had it.

42:47.280 --> 42:49.550
I've had it had it
with your being had it.

43:35.135 --> 43:38.071
(music playing)

44:05.639 --> 44:06.607
WOMAN: You stinker!

44:08.509 --> 44:11.411
(music playing)
