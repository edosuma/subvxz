01:56.116 --> 01:59.142
<i># He's all mine alone ## </i>

01:59.653 --> 02:02.019
<i>It all began at the Plaza Hotel...</i>

02:02.089 --> 02:04.182
<i>twenty years ago</i>
<i>in the month of June.</i>

02:04.258 --> 02:08.661
<i>Two mothers brought their</i>
<i>daughters, Liv and Emma...</i>

02:08.729 --> 02:11.562
<i>here to the Palm Court for tea.</i>

02:11.632 --> 02:14.829
<i>On that afternoon,</i>
<i>there was a wedding.</i>

02:16.003 --> 02:19.598
<i>There was something blue,</i>
<i>something borrowed...</i>

02:19.673 --> 02:22.437
<i>and something completely magical.</i>

02:22.509 --> 02:24.704
<i>And two little girls</i>
<i>from New Jersey...</i>

02:24.778 --> 02:27.838
<i>held in their hands a new dream-</i>

02:27.915 --> 02:31.715
<i>that one day they would find</i>
<i>that one person...</i>

02:31.785 --> 02:35.687
<i>who would stand by them</i>
<i>no matter what...</i>

02:35.756 --> 02:37.724
<i>and when they did, they too...</i>

02:37.791 --> 02:40.453
<i>would have June weddings at the Plaza.</i>

02:42.596 --> 02:44.530
Thank you.

02:44.598 --> 02:49.558
And, yes, Your Honor, I will take
this lofty man to be my husband.

02:49.637 --> 02:53.801
I always knew my wedding
would be the happiest day of my life.

02:53.874 --> 02:57.207
Now I will dance with you
until we have six babies and a house.

03:02.249 --> 03:05.184
Do you think they let pets
inside the Plaza?

03:05.252 --> 03:09.484
<i>Well, it's not like we're getting married</i>
<i>until we're 16 at least.</i>

03:09.556 --> 03:11.990
<i>Next time, can I play the bride?</i>

03:12.059 --> 03:13.993
Emma, you know
I always play the bride.

03:14.061 --> 03:17.519
<i># This will be an everlasting love #</i>

03:17.598 --> 03:20.066
<i>- # This will be- ## </i>
- Not too shabby.

03:20.134 --> 03:23.661
- Caviar cocktail hour-
- Cigar roller, white glove service-

03:23.737 --> 03:26.638
- Celadon cymbidium orchids.
- Great deejay.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.538
So we both admit it's beautiful.

03:28.609 --> 03:30.008
<i>- Um, yeah.</i>
<i>- But?</i>

03:30.077 --> 03:33.171
<i>Do you think it's the work</i>
<i>of Marion St. Claire?</i>

03:33.247 --> 03:35.374
Oh. Marion's a visionary.

03:35.449 --> 03:36.438
Mmm?

03:38.619 --> 03:40.849
- Oh.
- If it had been <i>my</i> wedding-

03:40.921 --> 03:42.684
- Oh, just say it.
- It ain't June.

03:42.756 --> 03:46.157
- And it ain't the Plaza.
- It's the elephant in the room.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.251
Yeah.

03:48.329 --> 03:50.729
- And here you are.
- Oh, look.

03:50.798 --> 03:53.358
A duck made out of ice.
Isn't this great?

03:53.434 --> 03:55.368
Know what else is great?

03:55.436 --> 03:58.667
Going home early and watching
your backed-up TiVo?

03:58.739 --> 04:00.707
Am I that predictable?

04:00.774 --> 04:03.072
How about one more dance...

04:03.143 --> 04:06.078
and I'll give you my piece
of the cake- if you let me lead.

04:06.146 --> 04:08.080
Very funny.

04:08.148 --> 04:10.946
- Come on. Come on.
- You know I always lead.

04:11.018 --> 04:13.486
Hey. Oh.

04:13.554 --> 04:15.545
Hi, girls.

04:15.622 --> 04:17.749
<i>- Are you ready to catch this bouquet?</i>
- Gotta go.

04:17.825 --> 04:20.952
<i>- I'm so happy all of you are here.</i>
- On the other hand, always fun.

04:21.028 --> 04:22.962
I know. They take it so seriously.

04:23.030 --> 04:26.830
<i>My work friends, sort of.</i>

04:26.900 --> 04:30.734
<i>My college buds- Oh, my God.</i>

04:30.804 --> 04:33.534
Emma Allan, is that the same dress
you wore to the Delta Gamma...

04:33.607 --> 04:36.132
"Kegs for a Cause" semiformal,
like, a bazillion years ago?

04:38.212 --> 04:40.339
- Yeah.
- What's your point? Because it's a classic.

04:40.414 --> 04:43.406
- If a dress works, you work it hard.
- Oh.

04:43.484 --> 04:45.850
See, that is sweet. And loyal.

04:45.919 --> 04:48.183
Girlfriends sticking up
for each other.

04:48.255 --> 04:50.587
<i>I like that, a lot. Keep that.</i>

04:50.657 --> 04:54.525
- Anyway, are you guys ready to catch this?
- Yeah.

04:54.595 --> 04:57.325
Just think about it,
feel it, catch it-

04:58.766 --> 05:03.533
One, two, three!

05:05.572 --> 05:08.370
<i>I would have seen the signs
if I'd been there.</i>

05:08.442 --> 05:13.345
<i>It's all right there.</i>
<i>Look at Emma's eyes-Like a hunter's.</i>

05:13.414 --> 05:18.283
<i>And Liv's hand-How would you like</i> that
<i>clasped around your throat?</i>

05:18.352 --> 05:22.812
<i>Not that either of them can imagine</i>
<i>hurting each other at this point.</i>

05:22.890 --> 05:26.291
<i>Why should they?</i>
<i>They've been inseparable for 20 years.</i>

05:26.360 --> 05:29.454
Okay, slow down.

05:29.530 --> 05:32.658
- Why can't we run with iPods?
- We can't run with iPods because iPods...

05:32.733 --> 05:34.963
are for people who can't be alone
with their own thoughts.

05:35.035 --> 05:37.060
I'm literally running circles around you.
Do you know that?

05:37.137 --> 05:39.230
Do you know how many things
I can think about at once?

05:39.306 --> 05:40.967
You know what a multitasker I am.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.975
You're not enjoying my conversation?
Is that what you're saying?

05:43.043 --> 05:44.977
- I'm hurt. I am very hurt, Liv.
- I gotta go.

05:45.045 --> 05:46.774
- All right. Have a good day.
- Love you.

05:46.847 --> 05:49.315
- Call me. Tell me how the meeting goes.
- Watch this power walk.

05:49.383 --> 05:51.476
- Whoo!
<i>- Whoo!</i>

05:51.718 --> 05:53.982
Hey, did you get the changes to the brief?

05:54.054 --> 05:56.215
- Read and highlighted in the cab.
- Great.

05:56.290 --> 05:59.157
Purse. It's like the whole city
is made out of lint.

05:59.226 --> 06:03.322
<i>It's an aggressive approach, exploiting</i>
<i>the weaknesses of our plaintiff's case...</i>

06:03.397 --> 06:05.456
and I think judicially
we'll find favor-

06:05.532 --> 06:08.501
Particularly if we pull Justice Givens.

06:08.569 --> 06:10.503
Thank you, Liv.

06:10.571 --> 06:12.505
Our best associate, Mr. Simmons.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.734
Maybe your approach
is too aggressive.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.867
<i>I mean, if we pound them...</i>

06:16.944 --> 06:19.276
as you suggest, they'll hardly
be in the mood to settle.

06:19.346 --> 06:22.611
Mr. Simmons, you don't-
You don't know me, but l-

06:22.683 --> 06:24.583
<i>I know you.</i>

06:24.651 --> 06:26.915
All you need to know
is how badly you want to win...

06:26.987 --> 06:29.421
because we won't be settling.

06:30.991 --> 06:34.017
You're right. She's perfect.

06:34.094 --> 06:37.689
- Oh, Ms. Allan?
- Hey, Robert. What's up?

06:37.764 --> 06:41.063
I think Ms. Delgado
is looking for you.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.568
Is she? W-Was she nearby?

06:43.637 --> 06:46.367
- She- She's in her room.
- She's-

06:49.843 --> 06:51.777
Emma, there you are.

06:51.845 --> 06:55.144
- Oh, God, Deb. Hi.
- I know. Isn't it gorgeous?

06:55.215 --> 06:58.241
God, I feel so blessed to have this body.

06:58.318 --> 07:01.310
- You know, I am so late-
- No, no, no. Listen. You gotta help me out here.

07:01.388 --> 07:03.583
- You know the debate team?
- Yeah.

07:03.657 --> 07:06.387
I cannot go to the state finals.

07:06.460 --> 07:09.793
I mean, children talking
about their little problems.

07:09.863 --> 07:12.229
Ugh! You gotta do it for me.

07:12.299 --> 07:16.633
Yeah, Deb, I'm already doing
your late bus patrol...

07:16.703 --> 07:19.638
and pep squad and your
after-school detention.

07:19.706 --> 07:22.809
You're the debate team adviser.
I don't think that I should-

07:22.810 --> 07:23.267
I know.

07:23.343 --> 07:25.277
I do so much.

07:25.345 --> 07:27.677
I wish I could just
do the bare minimum.

07:27.748 --> 07:30.012
I so admire you for that.

07:30.083 --> 07:32.142
Thank you.

07:32.219 --> 07:34.244
Anyway, all right, look.
Here's how we'll work it out.

07:34.321 --> 07:36.915
- I'll do the debate team-
- Okay, good.

07:36.990 --> 07:40.619
Uh-huh. If you take my Tuesday
study halls for the rest of the year.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.662
- Okay?
- Yeah, that's- No.

07:42.729 --> 07:45.596
All right. You owe me, girl.

07:45.666 --> 07:48.362
- Get out of the hallway, kids!
<i>- You know why she does this?</i>

07:48.435 --> 07:50.960
- You're the best teacher at that school.
- No, l-

07:51.038 --> 07:53.336
She's trying to overwork you,
so you crack under pressure.

07:53.407 --> 07:55.568
- Mm-mmm.
- Middle school's a jungle.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.769
I don't know. I think she's kind of sad.

07:57.844 --> 08:01.473
I mean, she's been divorced,
like, three times.

08:01.548 --> 08:04.984
She's way ahead of us.
I mean, where are our divorces?

08:05.052 --> 08:06.986
I gotta get married first.

08:07.054 --> 08:10.615
God, I hate Daniel!

08:12.426 --> 08:14.656
No, Kevin. I'm dealing with a crisis.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.662
What's your crisis?

08:16.730 --> 08:19.096
Uh, that's code for
"I don't want to talk to you."

08:19.166 --> 08:21.134
Oh, I see. Well, then thank you
for putting <i>me</i> through.

08:21.368 --> 08:23.342
<i>See? I told you those jeans</i>
would look great on you.

08:23.343 --> 08:24.132
They aren't too tight?

08:24.204 --> 08:26.468
<i>No, no. Not at all. But this-</i>

08:26.540 --> 08:28.872
I mean, Emma, yellow-
Not your color.

08:28.942 --> 08:31.877
Okay? Seriously.
Oh, but you know what? Try this.

08:31.945 --> 08:33.879
Because-You know what? Keep it.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.881
- Well-
- It never hung right on me anyway.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.852
Of course it doesn't
hang right on you.

08:40.921 --> 08:45.358
It's... my size, and it's new.

08:45.425 --> 08:48.019
This is the Dolce blouse
I told you about last week.

08:48.095 --> 08:50.495
- Liv, I can't.
- Hey, hey. It was on sale.

08:50.564 --> 08:53.362
- I practically made money on it.
- Liv, it's too much.

08:53.433 --> 08:55.264
Emma, Emma. Emma-
Just say thank you. Just-

08:57.104 --> 08:59.834
- Thank you. It's beautiful. I love it.
<i>- Good.</i>

08:59.906 --> 09:03.000
Now this- Emma's stuff. Emma's stuff.
Let's get rid of it at one point.

09:03.076 --> 09:05.010
You moved out, like,
a hundred years ago. Okay.

09:05.078 --> 09:08.104
- Daniel's sweater? Cardigan? You wanna try that?
- Yeah, love it.

09:13.086 --> 09:15.020
Oh-

09:16.657 --> 09:18.625
Tiffany box.

09:18.692 --> 09:20.785
- You're getting engaged?
- I'm getting engaged.

09:20.861 --> 09:23.853
- I'm getting engaged!
- You're getting engaged!

09:23.930 --> 09:25.227
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

09:25.298 --> 09:27.823
- Emma-
- No! Stop it. No. Liv!

09:27.901 --> 09:30.734
- I have to look.
- Stop it! No! No!

09:30.804 --> 09:32.533
No, no!

09:33.607 --> 09:35.939
You can't stop me.

09:37.711 --> 09:39.406
I'm sorry.

09:40.781 --> 09:43.545
But he should see your face
when you first see the ring.

09:43.617 --> 09:45.414
Good call.

09:45.485 --> 09:47.419
You always think of others, Emma.

09:47.487 --> 09:49.421
It never occurs to me like that.

09:49.489 --> 09:51.423
I mean, sometimes it does.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.558
I'm really happy for you.

09:56.630 --> 09:59.292
Promise me you won't tell anyone
until after he proposes.

09:59.366 --> 10:02.199
Oh, God. I would never.
I'd be out of my mind.

10:06.773 --> 10:09.469
I'm engaged!

10:11.344 --> 10:13.938
- Can we get four tequila shots?
- No. No.

10:14.014 --> 10:16.414
No, no, no. None for me.

10:16.483 --> 10:18.417
- Oh, right.
- I'm fine.

10:18.485 --> 10:21.921
Acapulco, 2006-
Emma and Fletcher on a break.

10:21.988 --> 10:23.979
"Never talk about that weekend again."

10:24.057 --> 10:28.517
"I'm so lonely and confused,
and very thirsty. Please, Miguel"-

10:28.595 --> 10:30.790
Okay, okay, okay.
Make it stop. Please.

10:30.864 --> 10:32.855
<i>All right, a toast.</i>

10:32.933 --> 10:35.697
To Liv-
Congratulations to an amazing friend.

10:35.769 --> 10:38.499
And condolences to Emma,
Liv's maid of honor.

10:38.572 --> 10:41.302
She will surely be
the most nightmarish bride ever.

10:41.374 --> 10:43.308
It is my burden and mine alone.

10:43.376 --> 10:46.209
- I'll be repaying the favor very soon. Cheers.
- Drink up.

10:46.279 --> 10:50.113
- What did I rush down here for?
- Nate! I'm getting married.

10:50.183 --> 10:51.844
- Get out.
- Yeah.

10:51.918 --> 10:53.852
Oh, my God. Sister's gettin' married here.

10:53.920 --> 10:57.651
- Where's-Where's the groom?
- Oh. Oh. He's not <i>here.</i>

10:57.724 --> 11:00.352
Well, he hasn't actually
popped the question yet.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.056
A toast-To Daniel...

11:03.130 --> 11:05.690
<i>who in his own world</i>
<i>is just working late...</i>

11:05.766 --> 11:07.700
but I guess in Liv's world
has just proposed.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.702
So God bless him for wanting...

11:09.770 --> 11:12.136
to spend his life
with my sister in any world.

11:12.205 --> 11:14.765
- To Liv.
- We love ya.

11:16.443 --> 11:20.209
- He's a lucky guy.
<i>- Yep. The biggest day of a girl's life.</i>

11:22.215 --> 11:24.513
I'm gonna be right back.

11:31.424 --> 11:34.552
- Damn. Should I?
- I got it.

11:48.475 --> 11:52.878
I mean, they didn't get
to see me graduate law school...

11:52.946 --> 11:56.313
or read Nate's first story
in <i>New York</i> magazine.

11:57.818 --> 12:00.082
So I can't share this with 'em.

12:03.156 --> 12:05.351
I wish your parents
could be here too.

12:07.394 --> 12:11.194
Whatever. It's fine. I'm fine.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.198
Liv, you're only human.

12:13.266 --> 12:16.963
You don't have to have it together
every minute of every day.

12:17.037 --> 12:20.700
Former chubby girls-
We're made of steel.

12:20.774 --> 12:23.834
And Splenda. We survive.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.935
Well, first of all, you weren't fat.

12:26.012 --> 12:27.946
But, yes, you do survive.

12:30.116 --> 12:32.050
- Thanks, Em.
- You're welcome, Liv.

12:32.118 --> 12:34.450
You're gonna be
the best maid of honor.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.580
- Yes, I am.
- What do we do first?

12:36.656 --> 12:38.590
First- Oh! I was thinking.

12:38.658 --> 12:40.990
It might be a good idea
to actually get the proposal.

12:41.061 --> 12:42.995
See? It's that head for details.

12:43.063 --> 12:44.963
Yeah, right? I know.

12:45.165 --> 12:47.190
<i>... people watching this
performance at home...</i>

12:47.267 --> 12:49.394
<i>with a huge question mark.</i>

12:49.469 --> 12:52.267
Hey, babe? I don't think
they sent us any fortune cookies.

12:52.339 --> 12:55.069
<i>No, they sent 'em.</i>
<i>I got them right here.</i>

12:55.141 --> 12:57.405
Oh, good.

12:57.477 --> 13:00.241
Okay. Here we are.

13:01.481 --> 13:03.415
- I'm just cuing it up.
- Mm-hmm.

13:03.483 --> 13:05.713
- This guy's gotta go. I'm sorry. I know you like him.
- Mm-hmm.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.253
- He's very pitchy.
- You know, Fletch, that is actually a real thing.

13:08.321 --> 13:10.346
Pitchy. It's not just code
for someone you don't like.

13:10.423 --> 13:12.357
Oh, okay. You're pitchy.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.825
Oh, uh, that one's mine.

13:14.895 --> 13:15.190
Please.

13:15.191 --> 13:17.420
You're really calling
dibs on fortune cookies now?

13:17.497 --> 13:19.522
- Yeah. It's on the right side.
- Okay, it's fine.

13:19.599 --> 13:20.182
Yours is the left.

13:20.183 --> 13:21.965
If your fortune's better
than mine, I'm claiming it.

13:22.035 --> 13:23.798
- I don't think it will be.
- Okay. Are you ready?

13:23.870 --> 13:25.701
- One-
- Two.

13:25.772 --> 13:27.137
Three.

13:37.284 --> 13:39.218
What's this?

13:39.286 --> 13:42.517
I put a lot of thought
into where I was gonna do this...

13:42.589 --> 13:44.648
and, uh, I wanna do it here.

13:44.724 --> 13:46.658
This is our home...

13:46.726 --> 13:51.663
and if I'm 99 years old and we're
doing exactly this in our home-

13:51.731 --> 13:54.632
TV and gettin' Chinese food-

13:54.701 --> 13:57.499
that'll be good enough for me.

13:59.773 --> 14:01.968
So, Emma Allan?

14:02.042 --> 14:03.976
- Uh-huh?
- Will you marry me?

14:04.044 --> 14:06.137
Yes. Yes.

14:08.014 --> 14:11.313
It didn't happen tonight.

14:11.384 --> 14:14.353
- But I'm not worried, 'cause I'm sure Daniel's-
- I-I'm engaged.

14:14.421 --> 14:19.415
Fletcher just proposed,
like, two minutes ago.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.426
I'm engaged.

14:21.494 --> 14:22.893
- Color?
- Colorless.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.692
- Cut?
- Brilliant.

14:24.764 --> 14:26.664
- Clarity?
- Slightly included.

14:26.733 --> 14:28.894
- Carat?
- Almost, maybe just under.

14:28.969 --> 14:31.267
More than he could afford, I'm sure.

14:31.338 --> 14:34.205
Ohhh.

14:34.274 --> 14:37.710
Engaged? Wow!

14:37.777 --> 14:40.211
Liv's engaged. You're engaged.

14:40.280 --> 14:43.340
That's-That's-

14:43.416 --> 14:46.249
C-Can I call you back?

14:49.756 --> 14:52.122
What do you mean
Emma's engaged?

14:52.192 --> 14:54.786
No. Of course I'm happy.
Why wouldn't I be happy?

14:54.861 --> 14:56.852
I think it's great. Yeah.

14:56.930 --> 15:00.161
No, you don't have to come here.
I'm fine. I'm not gonna eat anything. Okay.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.326
And I have the perfect
wedding present.

15:04.571 --> 15:07.699
You are going to live
with Emma and Fletcher.

15:14.014 --> 15:15.914
You're irritating me.

15:16.116 --> 15:17.947
I can't believe it.

15:18.018 --> 15:21.249
It's so weird having this on my finger.
I mean, hey, look.

15:21.321 --> 15:24.290
- It even sparkles in the rain.
- Blinding. Ouch.

15:24.357 --> 15:26.791
So I'm thinking about getting
DJ Humble to spin at my party.

15:26.860 --> 15:29.294
- I don't know though. Is that weird?
- You should go for it.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.296
- I'm not really a big band kind of girl.
- Whatever.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.889
- It's your wedding.
- Oh. My mom can't fly up until the wedding.

15:33.967 --> 15:36.595
She's too busy with work.
But who cares. I've got you, right?

15:36.669 --> 15:40.662
- Yeah. I'm so psyched.
- So would you come with me to meet her?

15:42.442 --> 15:45.002
- I'm sorry. What? Meet who?
- Marion St. Claire.

15:45.078 --> 15:47.512
Haven't you been listening?
I've got an appointment with her on Friday.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.514
- You already made an appointment?
- Yeah.

15:49.582 --> 15:51.846
- You just got engaged last night.
- I know.

15:51.918 --> 15:53.852
But technically, I'm already behind.

15:53.920 --> 15:55.911
You gotta book early
if you want the Plaza.

15:55.989 --> 15:58.981
The Plaza? I can't believe this.

15:59.059 --> 16:01.289
What-What's the matter?
Why are you mad?

16:01.361 --> 16:03.386
I'm not mad. No, not at you.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.431
I just don't know
what's taking Daniel so long.

16:06.499 --> 16:08.933
Oh, God. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have-

16:09.002 --> 16:11.334
We don't have to talk about this.
Let's just drop it.

16:11.404 --> 16:13.372
Don't worry about me.
Worry about Daniel.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.374
- He's gonna be dead soon.
- Why? What-

16:15.442 --> 16:17.376
- Call you later.
- What are you go-

16:17.444 --> 16:20.470
Liv, you let him
do this his own way.

16:22.282 --> 16:24.716
Excuse me. Excuse me.

16:24.784 --> 16:26.775
Excuse me!

16:29.522 --> 16:31.456
Honey!

16:31.524 --> 16:33.458
Will you just marry me, already?

16:33.526 --> 16:36.518
Yeah. Okay.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.664
Isn't that what you want?
'Cause it's what I want...

16:39.732 --> 16:41.700
and I just wanna know
if you want to marry me.

16:41.768 --> 16:44.703
- Don't you wanna get married?
- Honey, can we talk about this later?

16:44.771 --> 16:47.797
Oh, you changed your mind?
I saw the Tiffany box in the closet.

16:47.874 --> 16:51.207
Right?

16:53.913 --> 16:55.938
- Uh-
- Oh, my God.

16:58.318 --> 17:00.252
It's not a ring?

17:00.320 --> 17:03.312
If it's a key chain
I'm gonna kill myself...

17:03.389 --> 17:06.085
- and I'm taking you down with me.
- Oh.

17:06.159 --> 17:08.388
Could you just tell me
right here and right now?

17:08.461 --> 17:10.724
Is it something that you would want?

17:10.797 --> 17:12.731
Would you want-
Would you want to get married?

17:12.799 --> 17:14.733
You know what I will tell you?

17:14.800 --> 17:18.237
I have never met a more obnoxious...

17:18.304 --> 17:21.865
<i>complicated, overbearing...</i>

17:21.941 --> 17:25.536
gorgeous, smart, sexy woman in my life.

17:25.612 --> 17:27.978
And-

17:28.047 --> 17:30.174
if you had just waited until tonight-

17:32.819 --> 17:35.379
- then you wouldn't be the woman
I fell in love with...

17:35.455 --> 17:37.389
because she doesn't know
how to wait.

17:37.457 --> 17:39.288
- Will you hold that for a second?
- Yeah.

17:39.359 --> 17:43.090
Which is fine, as long as I get
to spend the rest of my life...

17:43.163 --> 17:45.961
trying to catch up with her.

17:46.032 --> 17:48.523
- Liv?
- Hmm?

17:48.601 --> 17:50.796
Will you marry me?

17:52.305 --> 17:54.239
- Are you proposing?
- Mmm.

17:54.307 --> 17:57.640
Really? Honey, it's so out of nowhere.

17:57.710 --> 18:00.975
- Liv, shut up. Yes or no?
- Yes. Yes.

18:01.047 --> 18:03.447
- Babe.
- Yes.

18:03.516 --> 18:05.984
- This is not how I planned it.
<i>- Are you kidding?</i>

18:06.052 --> 18:08.953
Oh!

18:09.022 --> 18:13.220
- I love "Bring Your Hot Girlfriend to Work" day.
- Totally.

18:15.461 --> 18:17.395
<i>And that is the journey that brought...</i>

18:17.463 --> 18:21.957
<i>these two young brides to my townhouse</i>
<i>on that particular afternoon.</i>

18:22.035 --> 18:25.266
- No, no, no. Don't do that.
Not now. Not now. Let's go.

18:25.338 --> 18:27.272
Okay. I'm good.

18:27.340 --> 18:29.274
<i>I'm Marion St. Claire...</i>

18:29.342 --> 18:32.505
<i>the most sought-after</i>
<i>wedding planner in Manhattan.</i>

18:40.653 --> 18:43.622
- Hi. We're Marion's 1:00.
- Mm-hmm.

18:43.690 --> 18:47.421
We're both getting married,
and we're both each other's maid of honor.

18:47.493 --> 18:50.690
No way. That's incredible.

18:54.434 --> 18:56.902
Ms. St. Claire will see you now.

18:59.439 --> 19:01.430
- Hi. I'm Liv Lerner.
- Hi, Ms. St. Claire. Wow.

19:01.507 --> 19:02.997
- This is Emma Allan.
- What an honor.

19:03.076 --> 19:04.941
- We've been best friends for a long time.
- I can't believe this.

19:05.011 --> 19:05.875
Sit.

19:05.945 --> 19:07.936
- Okay.
- Got it.

19:13.853 --> 19:17.118
A wedding marks the first day...

19:17.190 --> 19:19.181
of the rest of your life.

19:19.259 --> 19:21.989
You have been dead until now.

19:22.061 --> 19:24.621
<i>W- Were you aware of that?</i>

19:24.697 --> 19:26.858
You're dead right now.

19:26.933 --> 19:28.230
- I understand.
- Thank you.

19:28.301 --> 19:31.964
Angela, for example, will die dead.

19:32.038 --> 19:35.405
<i>Now I've read the brief</i>
<i>that she put together on you-</i>

19:35.475 --> 19:39.741
June weddings at the Plaza.

19:39.812 --> 19:43.009
So it's not even a remote possibility?

19:44.083 --> 19:47.610
If you'd gone elsewhere, not a chance.

19:47.687 --> 19:50.622
But you've come to me.

19:50.690 --> 19:53.158
Call me dream catcher. I'll answer.

19:53.226 --> 19:55.524
Ooh. Dream catcher.

19:56.929 --> 19:59.363
I happen to have...

19:59.432 --> 20:03.732
<i>three openings at the Plaza in June.</i>

20:05.204 --> 20:07.468
Two the first Saturday...

20:07.540 --> 20:09.940
and one the last Saturday.

20:10.009 --> 20:12.170
That would be the 6th and the 27 th.

20:12.245 --> 20:14.873
Oh! My parents' anniversary
is the 6th. That's so meant to be.

20:14.947 --> 20:16.881
- Oh, my gosh!
- Yeah.

20:16.949 --> 20:19.247
- Well, then I'll take the 27 th.
- Great.

20:19.319 --> 20:22.015
Um, you'll wanna discuss this
with your grooms.

20:22.088 --> 20:24.113
- No.
- All right then.

20:24.190 --> 20:26.420
Just sign and...

20:26.492 --> 20:28.551
date these.

20:28.628 --> 20:30.755
- Okay.
- This feels pretty good right now, I gotta say.

20:30.830 --> 20:33.799
Now, uh, we should discuss themes.

20:33.866 --> 20:35.857
- Uh, elegant minimalism-
- Classic traditionalism-

20:35.935 --> 20:40.201
- with romantic textures.
- and trendy infusion.

20:40.273 --> 20:42.571
- I'm impressed.
- Really?

20:42.642 --> 20:45.873
- Well, we love you so much.
- She means- She means "Thank you."

20:45.945 --> 20:48.379
Your 1:15 is here, Ms. St. Claire.

20:48.448 --> 20:51.246
Thank you... so much.

20:51.317 --> 20:54.775
<i>I have packets for you up front.</i>

20:54.854 --> 20:57.322
Bride to bride, there's only
one June opening left at the Plaza.

20:57.390 --> 21:00.723
Oh, my God. Thank you.
You are so sweet.

21:00.793 --> 21:03.990
Ms. St. Claire, first off,
I'm obsessed with you.

21:04.063 --> 21:05.997
- Uh, it's an honor and a privilege.
- Sit.

21:06.065 --> 21:07.327
Sure.

21:14.440 --> 21:17.534
June. At the Plaza.

21:20.279 --> 21:23.442
<i>Look at them-
So blissfully unaware...</i>

21:23.516 --> 21:25.848
<i>of the implications</i>
<i>of their wedding date.</i>

21:25.918 --> 21:30.719
<i>You see, at this point, June was</i>
<i>a mere three and a half months away-</i>

21:30.790 --> 21:33.258
<i>A blink of an eye, in wedding time.</i>

21:33.326 --> 21:35.760
<i># Got my dreams, got my life, got my love #</i>

21:35.828 --> 21:38.353
<i># Got my friends</i>
<i>Got the sunshine above #</i>

21:38.431 --> 21:40.695
<i># Why am I making this</i>
<i>hard on myself #</i>

21:40.767 --> 21:43.497
<i># When there's so many</i>
<i>beautiful reasons I have to be #</i>

21:43.569 --> 21:46.538
<i># Happy #</i>

21:48.207 --> 21:50.141
<i># Yeah ## </i>

21:59.318 --> 22:03.618
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

22:03.689 --> 22:05.623
Miss Wang-

22:05.691 --> 22:07.852
Ohh- Lace bodice.

22:07.927 --> 22:11.363
Basque waist, 10-layer tulle-

22:11.431 --> 22:13.456
You should try it on.

22:13.533 --> 22:15.831
No. No, no. I'm wearing my mom's dress.

22:15.902 --> 22:17.836
Emma, are you sure?

22:17.904 --> 22:21.032
Your mom's dress is beautiful,
but is- is it your dream or hers?

22:21.107 --> 22:23.507
It's mine. It's mine.
I wanna surprise her.

22:23.576 --> 22:25.510
But it is your day.

22:25.578 --> 22:28.376
Can't you just send her a big box
of chocolates on Mother's Day...

22:28.448 --> 22:30.848
- and get the dress you want?
- It's really pretty.

22:30.917 --> 22:33.977
- And I do love strapless.
- Me too.

22:34.053 --> 22:36.920
I feel like I'm cheating
on my mom's dress.

22:36.989 --> 22:39.651
I can't. I can't. I've very comfortable
with my decision.

22:39.725 --> 22:42.489
- I'm just gonna put it back. Put it back.
- Okay.

22:42.562 --> 22:45.429
But I mean, if <i>you</i> like it...

22:45.498 --> 22:48.365
- you should try it on.
- No. You saw it first.

22:48.434 --> 22:48.727
Please.

22:48.728 --> 22:51.198
That's a terrible reason.
We're gonna try this on, okay?

22:51.270 --> 22:53.534
No, uh, I'm gonna... try it on.

22:57.143 --> 23:00.203
It's stunning. It's perfect.

23:00.279 --> 23:03.271
- I know. Right?
- Mm-hmm.

23:03.349 --> 23:05.283
I should probably keep looking.

23:05.351 --> 23:08.445
Do you think there is something
better than Vera Wang?

23:08.521 --> 23:11.786
I'm sorry. Do they keep that next to
the something that is better than chocolate?

23:11.858 --> 23:15.191
- Liv, get the dress.
- What if you change your mind?

23:15.261 --> 23:17.456
Just be very careful about
any pre-wedding weight gain.

23:17.530 --> 23:20.863
You don't alter a Vera to fit you;
you alter yourself to fit Vera.

23:20.933 --> 23:24.926
Weight gain. Please.
Yeah. Right. Me lose control?

23:26.138 --> 23:28.333
You see these eyes?
You know what that is?

23:28.407 --> 23:30.705
Focus. That's right.

23:30.776 --> 23:33.142
Well, it's contacts- and focus.

23:34.514 --> 23:37.108
- You know, I'll take it.
- Perfect.

23:37.183 --> 23:39.083
I'll get you more champagne.

23:46.726 --> 23:49.217
Marion.

23:49.462 --> 23:51.396
A terrible mistake has been made...

23:51.464 --> 23:54.365
one I assure you
has never happened before...

23:54.433 --> 23:57.891
in the House of St. Claire.

23:57.970 --> 24:01.497
Your weddings have been
booked on the same day.

24:01.574 --> 24:04.509
<i>Can you say that again?</i>
<i>I'm sorry. What?</i>

24:04.577 --> 24:07.444
Your weddings
have been scheduled for the same date.

24:07.513 --> 24:10.744
- Mother "F."
- Are you insane?

24:10.816 --> 24:13.250
The Plaza is our lifelong dream.

24:13.319 --> 24:16.288
Angela... mixed up the dates.

24:16.355 --> 24:19.449
You are now both set
to be married June 6...

24:19.525 --> 24:21.459
and the other bride on June 27.

24:21.527 --> 24:24.928
<i>The next available date</i>
<i>at the Plaza is June 15-</i>

24:24.997 --> 24:27.966
- Perfect. I'll take it.
- Three years from now.

24:30.703 --> 24:33.467
- This is no-
- No, I can't-

24:33.539 --> 24:35.700
It's no problem.
Hold on. It's no problem.

24:35.775 --> 24:39.677
Because I'll negotiate it.
I negotiate for a living.

24:39.745 --> 24:42.106
I'll get the other bride
to switch her dates with you.

24:42.107 --> 24:42.578
Trust me.

24:42.648 --> 24:44.946
You can't say no to that face.

24:45.017 --> 24:48.384
<i>Yes, well, our confidentiality agreement...</i>

24:48.454 --> 24:50.388
means that I cannot tell you who she is...

24:50.456 --> 24:55.291
so which one of you will choose a different venue?

24:55.361 --> 24:58.330
<i>I'm leaving right now, Ms. St. Claire.</i>

24:58.397 --> 25:01.628
Word to the wise, dear-
and also to you-

25:01.701 --> 25:03.726
do not use me as a reference.

25:15.114 --> 25:16.979
- Hello, Angela.
- Just...

25:17.049 --> 25:18.846
tell us where the other bride is...

25:18.918 --> 25:21.182
and nobody's gonna get hurt.

25:34.767 --> 25:35.893
- Hi.
- Hello, Stacy.

25:35.968 --> 25:37.128
- How are you?
- It's Emma and Liv.

25:37.203 --> 25:39.000
- You look gorgeous.
- Did you lose weight?

25:39.071 --> 25:41.005
You want me to change
the date of my wedding?

25:41.073 --> 25:43.007
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- That'd be great.

25:43.075 --> 25:46.670
- No.
- You take the 6th, give me the 27 th-

25:46.746 --> 25:48.680
She can be your wedding buddy.

25:48.748 --> 25:51.216
- I'm a ball. Really. I am.
- Don't touch me.

25:51.283 --> 25:53.877
Let's talk numbers.

25:53.953 --> 25:56.353
Every wedding has a price, hon.
What's yours?

25:56.422 --> 25:59.118
You can't buy me. So again, no.

25:59.191 --> 26:02.558
No, no, no. A thousand times, no.

26:02.628 --> 26:04.562
Good luck, ladies.

26:08.134 --> 26:10.068
There's something wrong with you.

26:11.170 --> 26:13.730
You're not leaving
until you change your-

26:13.806 --> 26:16.468
<i>- She's crazy!</i>

26:16.542 --> 26:20.672
- Just change your date.
- She's crazy! Somebody call Security.

26:20.746 --> 26:24.375
- You won't even change your date!
- You're crazy!

26:24.450 --> 26:27.283
- It's unnecessary for you to touch me so hard.
- Technically, she pushed me too.

26:27.353 --> 26:31.619
- Come on. Have a nice day.
- Whatever.

26:31.691 --> 26:34.524
We could sue. We could sue.
You're a lawyer. We could sue 'em all.

26:34.593 --> 26:37.027
We could sue the Plaza. We could sue Marion.
We could sue Angela-

26:37.096 --> 26:39.360
What's the point?
None of them are gonna make it right.

26:39.432 --> 26:41.662
No. It's up to us.
I want you at my wedding.

26:41.734 --> 26:44.032
And whichever way this works out...

26:44.103 --> 26:46.537
one of us will just have
to be married on a different day.

26:46.605 --> 26:49.540
Absolutely. I mean, you know,
I want you at <i>my</i> wedding.

26:49.608 --> 26:53.271
Obviously. If we can't
think of any other way out of this...

26:53.345 --> 26:55.279
one of us will simply
have to be flexible.

26:55.347 --> 26:57.815
Yeah. One of us will just
have to change venues.

26:59.085 --> 27:01.019
Right. One of us could.

27:01.087 --> 27:03.419
<i>Probably, um, not...</i>

27:03.489 --> 27:05.719
the one of us who's been
saving up for a decade...

27:05.791 --> 27:08.692
because she makes a pittance
compared to the other one of us, but-

27:08.761 --> 27:11.195
True. I mean, or it would be...

27:11.263 --> 27:14.289
if the other one of us wasn't
so desperate to get married at the Plaza...

27:14.366 --> 27:17.995
because the Plaza, practically, is the only
happy memory she has of her childhood.

27:18.070 --> 27:22.097
- So, oops. That's-
- Right.

27:22.174 --> 27:24.699
- One of us will have to move her date.
- Yep.

27:24.777 --> 27:27.678
One of us will.

27:27.747 --> 27:30.181
And until one of us decides, we shouldn't
make any concrete plans.

27:30.249 --> 27:32.513
Agreed. There's some time
before we lock things in.

27:32.585 --> 27:34.849
- Let's just not do anything-
- Right.

27:34.920 --> 27:37.115
- until one of us moves her date.
- Okay.

27:37.189 --> 27:39.282
So, um-

27:41.327 --> 27:43.659
Talk to you soon.
One of us should-

27:43.729 --> 27:45.993
Call the other one.

27:46.065 --> 27:48.863
<i>One of us hasn't called me yet,</i>
<i>but you know what?</i>

27:48.934 --> 27:51.903
She's gonna move her date. She always was
the bendy one, even as a kid, remember?

27:51.971 --> 27:53.905
Yeah, she didn't sound
too bendy to me.

27:59.812 --> 28:02.144
I called Fletch, and she picked up.

28:02.214 --> 28:04.148
<i>He's doin' my taxes tomorrow night.</i>

28:04.216 --> 28:06.184
You can't get all buddy-buddy
with him. Not now.

28:06.252 --> 28:08.015
Anyway, Daniel can do your taxes.
He's "financey."

28:08.087 --> 28:11.989
It's a hedge fund, babe.
We don't do a lot of tax prep.

28:12.057 --> 28:13.116
Whatever. You do our taxes.

28:13.117 --> 28:15.390
Fletch has been my accountant
for six years. I'm going.

28:15.461 --> 28:18.430
<i>You're being ridiculous.</i>
<i>Just have a double wedding.</i>

28:18.497 --> 28:20.692
What are we, 41 -year-old twin sisters?

28:20.766 --> 28:23.530
Babe! Double wedding.

28:23.602 --> 28:27.094
<i>A double wedding.
I think that's a great idea.</i>

28:27.173 --> 28:30.665
- It would be a hell of a party.
- You know, uh, no.

28:30.743 --> 28:33.735
I've shared everything my whole life with Liv.

28:33.813 --> 28:36.077
I'd kinda like my own day just-just once.

28:36.148 --> 28:38.480
I know, bug. Is this everything?
This is all your gas receipts-

28:38.551 --> 28:40.746
Threw it all in the shoe box.
I don't know.

28:40.820 --> 28:43.186
It's my dream too-To get married at the Plaza.

28:43.255 --> 28:46.053
I have been saving since I was 16.

28:47.626 --> 28:50.117
<i>I just need a few more days</i>
<i>to... let it go.</i>

28:50.196 --> 28:53.029
I'll find a new dream.
Liv's reasons are better than mine.

28:53.098 --> 28:55.589
<i>It's like</i> American Idol, <i>all right?</i>

28:55.668 --> 28:57.898
Liv is the Simon. Ugh. God.

28:57.970 --> 29:00.404
I mean, no offense.
But you're the Paula.

29:00.472 --> 29:03.532
<i>Even when they can't sing,</i>
<i>you compliment their outfit.</i>

29:03.609 --> 29:06.703
<i>- It's nice.</i>
- Well, but everyone listens to Simon.

29:06.779 --> 29:10.078
I wouldn't marry Simon.
I'd marry me some Paula.

29:11.617 --> 29:13.448
Mmm.

29:15.020 --> 29:18.183
- That's nice.
- Just pick one. I'm fine with any of' em.

29:18.257 --> 29:20.691
See? That's why I need a maid of honor.
You don't care.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.727
l- Hey, you wanna have her
back in the game?

29:22.795 --> 29:25.025
You know what you're gonna have to do,
and the sooner the better.

29:25.097 --> 29:27.031
- We need to give our guests some notice.
- Exactly.

29:27.099 --> 29:29.413
Which is why save-the-dates
are so key, but you don't care.

29:30.336 --> 29:32.634
- It's not that I don't care.
- Well, get your phone then.

29:32.705 --> 29:35.902
- Hello?
- Men.

29:35.975 --> 29:39.843
Yo, Fletch. No, nothin' much.
Just lookin' at save-the-dates or invites.

29:39.912 --> 29:41.903
- Are we still on for tomorrow?
- Yeah, totally.

29:41.981 --> 29:45.508
Any sign of progress on your end?
Is Liv softening at all?

29:45.584 --> 29:47.916
No way. And there's no way
she's gonna blink first.

29:47.987 --> 29:49.921
<i>They haven't spoken for a week.</i>

29:49.989 --> 29:51.980
That's a century in girl years.

29:52.057 --> 29:54.992
What is it about weddings
that makes 'em so worked up?

29:55.060 --> 29:57.187
I know. I have no idea.

29:57.263 --> 30:00.096
It's, like, the wrong time to let
the guy know that you're crazy.

30:00.165 --> 30:02.633
- You know what I mean? It's not how I'd play it.
- Yeah.

30:02.701 --> 30:04.692
Oh, you know what? She's here now.

30:04.770 --> 30:06.704
- I'll see you tomorrow?
- All right.

30:06.772 --> 30:08.706
<i>Hey.</i>

30:08.774 --> 30:10.708
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi.

30:10.776 --> 30:13.210
- How was pep squad?
- I hate pep squad.

30:13.279 --> 30:16.077
I particularly hate
peppy teenage girls...

30:16.148 --> 30:19.606
who insist everyone be aggressive-
B.E. aggressive.

30:19.685 --> 30:22.813
It's, like, there are other pathways in life
besides aggression, you know?

30:26.091 --> 30:27.786
I'm gonna call Liv.

30:29.929 --> 30:31.863
- Really?
- Yeah.

30:31.931 --> 30:34.525
Amie and Marissa are
throwing us that joint shower...

30:34.600 --> 30:37.831
and it'd be good to have all this
behind us by then. Right?

30:37.903 --> 30:39.837
<i>- You sure?</i>
- Yeah.

30:39.905 --> 30:43.170
<i>Yeah. I agree. I was just talkin'</i>
<i>to Daniel. She's on her cell.</i>

30:43.242 --> 30:46.234
You should call her. They're out
doin' their save-the-dates or whatever.

30:46.312 --> 30:49.577
- What?
- You should hit her up.

30:51.951 --> 30:55.409
You have to know your "date" date...

30:55.487 --> 30:59.651
to send out your save-the-dates.

31:00.726 --> 31:02.751
Oh.

31:02.828 --> 31:05.820
We were both gonna wait, and she- she-

31:05.898 --> 31:07.923
I ca- I can't believe it.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.662
You can't believe this?
Really? It's Liv.

31:10.736 --> 31:13.227
- She's always thinking about number one.
<i>- No.</i>

31:13.305 --> 31:15.865
Not this time. No.
No, no, no, no, no.

31:15.941 --> 31:18.273
I am a bride too. Okay?

31:18.344 --> 31:22.576
<i>I'm number one too.</i>

31:22.648 --> 31:26.243
l-You are my number one.
I know. That's how I feel.

31:28.320 --> 31:30.379
Bug, what are you doing?

31:31.957 --> 31:34.357
<i>- Subject-</i>
- Listen. Listen. No, no, no, no, no.

31:34.426 --> 31:36.690
Emergency. This is not spam.

31:36.762 --> 31:40.596
<i>- I'm getting married, June 6-</i>
- You don't have to slam on the keys.

31:40.666 --> 31:45.433
The Plaza Hotel. Be there.
X-O-X-O-X-O-X-O. Emma.

31:45.504 --> 31:48.530
Address book. B.C.C. everyone.

31:48.607 --> 31:50.541
<i>Oops. Not you, Liv.</i>

31:50.609 --> 31:52.577
<i>- And send.</i>

31:59.885 --> 32:02.752
"Emergen-C-C-C.
'Thys' is 'nit' spam.

32:02.821 --> 32:07.224
I'm get married. June 6th."

32:08.293 --> 32:11.854
"K.J.A."? "Kuh-jaw"?

32:11.930 --> 32:14.364
"Emma."

32:14.433 --> 32:16.731
What is "kuh-jaw," Emma?

32:18.971 --> 32:22.202
Great. Emma's wedding's
gonna be better than ours was.

32:22.274 --> 32:24.572
Glen.

32:24.643 --> 32:27.669
Maybe her marriage
will be better too.

32:27.746 --> 32:31.705
Not filled with loneliness and sadness.

32:32.384 --> 32:34.784
I hope you can appreciate
the positions Amie and I are in.

32:34.853 --> 32:37.287
- We're not taking sides.
- Relax.

32:37.356 --> 32:40.770
We're not making any plans
until we figure this out.

32:40.771 --> 32:41.156
Wow.

32:41.226 --> 32:43.126
- You're so cool about it.
- Yeah.

32:43.195 --> 32:44.372
How else am I gonna be?

32:44.373 --> 32:47.188
- I mean -Without taking sides though,
I have to say...

32:47.266 --> 32:49.757
Emma's save-the-date e-mail
was a smidge tacky.

32:49.835 --> 32:52.303
I mean, "June 6 at the Plaza," smiley face?

32:52.371 --> 32:55.033
What's next, hearts over her i's?

32:55.107 --> 32:57.541
<i>- Come on, really- What was she thinking?</i>
- Oh, hey.

32:57.609 --> 33:00.737
- I know, right?
- That was so tacky.

33:00.813 --> 33:02.974
- It's shocking.
<i>- Hi. Hi, Heidi.</i>

33:07.953 --> 33:12.652
- Oh, Elizabeth, I love my ring.
<i>- Oh, my gosh.</i>

33:12.724 --> 33:14.658
<i>Emma?</i>

33:18.263 --> 33:20.857
You sent out your save-the-dates?

33:20.933 --> 33:23.959
Yeah, I did, actually.

33:24.036 --> 33:27.494
Uh-

33:27.573 --> 33:29.200
Surprised?

33:30.509 --> 33:32.943
So one of us...

33:33.011 --> 33:35.377
is not moving her date?

33:37.416 --> 33:42.979
Well, you amaze me, Liv. You really do.

33:43.055 --> 33:47.549
You-You never ask me what I want.
You just figure you know best, end of story.

33:47.626 --> 33:49.560
"Emma, wear this.
Emma, say that."

33:49.628 --> 33:51.562
Well, Emma's pretty
frickin' tired of it.

33:51.630 --> 33:51.928
 Oh, whoa.

33:51.929 --> 33:53.598
 Don't think I didn't notice
how totally freaked out...

33:53.665 --> 33:55.641
you were because I had the nerve
to get engaged before you did.

33:55.642 --> 33:56.259
<i>Okay, wait.</i>

33:56.335 --> 33:58.394
First of all, Daniel
bought that ring in December.

33:58.470 --> 34:01.997
Okay? So officially, I was first.

34:02.074 --> 34:03.071
Oh, pathetic. Pathetic!

34:03.072 --> 34:06.408
<i>Second, people always make you</i>
<i>do things you don't wanna do.</i>

34:06.478 --> 34:10.039
Emma, it's like you don't have a spine.
Oh, wait. That's right.

34:10.114 --> 34:12.379
You <i>don't</i> have a spine.

34:12.451 --> 34:14.942
Wow.

34:15.020 --> 34:17.045
No one could accuse you
of being soft, Liv.

34:17.121 --> 34:20.114
<i>You grabbed the first date</i>
<i>in June Marion offered...</i>

34:20.192 --> 34:22.683
without even asking me first.

34:22.761 --> 34:25.025
At least I'm not so terrified
of being alone...

34:25.097 --> 34:27.463
that I people-please
my way through life.

34:29.134 --> 34:31.068
Emma, you settle.

34:31.136 --> 34:34.036
Are you saying that
I'm settling with Fletcher?

34:34.106 --> 34:36.074
I wasn't thinking about Fletcher.

34:36.141 --> 34:38.438
You came up with that one on your own.

34:38.510 --> 34:39.636
Ooh.

34:43.215 --> 34:45.239
Move your date, Liv.

34:45.317 --> 34:48.047
You move your date, Emma.

34:52.724 --> 34:55.454
It's done. You lose.

34:58.630 --> 35:00.621
Your wedding better watch it.

35:03.602 --> 35:06.298
What did you just say?

35:06.371 --> 35:09.829
I said your wedding
should be very scared right now.

35:09.908 --> 35:12.843
If I were your wedding,
I'd sleep with one eye open.

35:14.379 --> 35:17.507
Why don't you just
save your threats for Daniel?

35:17.583 --> 35:20.518
After all, isn't that how
you got a proposal out of him?

35:20.586 --> 35:22.986
- That's how I did it.
- Your wedding can suck it.

35:23.055 --> 35:26.183
What did you just say?
My wedding can suck it?

35:26.258 --> 35:28.488
- I said your wedding can suck it.
- Your wedding can s- be-

35:28.560 --> 35:31.825
I mean, yours can be, um-

35:31.897 --> 35:34.195
Can-Can be, uh-

35:34.266 --> 35:36.530
not that-

35:36.602 --> 35:38.536
Please.

35:40.105 --> 35:41.970
- Bye, ladies.
- Hey, Liv.

35:42.040 --> 35:44.668
Yes.

35:44.743 --> 35:46.836
Your wedding will be huge.

35:47.879 --> 35:50.473
Just like your ass at prom.

35:52.751 --> 35:54.514
We're done.

36:03.729 --> 36:06.425
5:00, Saturday, June 6. Done.

36:07.799 --> 36:09.924
- Done.
- Hmm.

36:09.925 --> 36:10.632
Good.

36:10.702 --> 36:13.967
Now we just have to find you
another maid of honor, uh, and fast.

36:14.039 --> 36:16.303
You'll be spending more time
with her than with the groom.

36:16.375 --> 36:19.344
- My friends won't take sides.
- Who says it has to be a friend?

36:19.411 --> 36:21.709
- No! No! Not just a bridesmaid.
<i>- This spot okay?</i>

36:21.780 --> 36:25.511
Yeah. Maid of honor. Maid of honor.

36:25.584 --> 36:27.711
Yeah. We were so close in law school.

36:27.786 --> 36:29.720
That study group was nuts.

36:29.788 --> 36:32.780
Oh, sweetie, you are
my second cousin's best friend.

36:32.858 --> 36:35.691
Of course you were at the very top
of my maid of honor list.

36:35.761 --> 36:39.253
Honestly, Carla. Caitlin?

36:39.331 --> 36:42.596
Erin, no. I did not sleep with him.

36:44.503 --> 36:46.437
All right, okay. I did, actually.

36:46.505 --> 36:49.736
Once. Twice.

36:49.808 --> 36:53.744
What difference does it make?
He was a loser, and he was lousy in-

36:55.147 --> 36:57.547
You did? Really?
I didn't hear that-

36:59.051 --> 37:02.612
Two kids? Wow. You guys
must have had really cute kids.

37:02.688 --> 37:06.681
Uh, yeah. Tell him I say hi, and-

37:06.758 --> 37:09.989
Actually, I'm hopping into a cab,
so I'm gonna give you a call a little later.

37:16.201 --> 37:18.601
- Kevin?
- Yeah?

37:20.972 --> 37:22.940
<i>I'd like to promote you-</i>

37:24.543 --> 37:27.068
to mister of honor.

37:27.145 --> 37:30.581
Do I get- Is-
Is it, like, a pay thing?

37:30.649 --> 37:33.812
No. Just- It's just an honor.

37:33.885 --> 37:37.821
<i> Uh, have a classmate read your draft.</i>
<i>I think that's a great idea.</i>

37:37.889 --> 37:40.551
<i>Because by letting a classmate</i>
<i>read your draft-</i>

37:40.625 --> 37:43.890
Oh, thank God. All right.
You guys finish the rest of this.

37:43.962 --> 37:45.896
Just read it yourselves.

37:47.332 --> 37:49.266
- Did you get my note?
- Yeah.

37:49.334 --> 37:52.269
Can you take my late bus patrol today?

37:52.337 --> 37:54.601
Sure.

37:54.673 --> 37:57.369
- Deb?
- Yeah?

37:57.442 --> 38:00.468
Yeah?

38:00.545 --> 38:03.514
- I know we're not exactly friends-
- We're not?

38:03.582 --> 38:06.551
- Then why am I always doing you favors?
- You never do me-

38:06.618 --> 38:09.018
Never mind.

38:10.389 --> 38:12.448
How'd you like to be my maid of honor?

38:12.524 --> 38:14.458
Do I get to pick out my own dress?

38:14.526 --> 38:16.585
I tend to draw the eye,
so it's gotta be good.

38:16.661 --> 38:18.595
Absolutely.

38:18.663 --> 38:21.097
I mean, you know, I might
make some suggestions, but-

38:21.166 --> 38:24.761
Oh, you know, I'm really swamped though.
I'd need a lot of help.

38:24.836 --> 38:26.770
What do you think the bride is for?

38:26.838 --> 38:28.863
To make the maid of honor's
life easier, right?

38:28.940 --> 38:31.465
I mean, come on. Please.

38:31.543 --> 38:35.001
Aw. All right. Since you begged-

38:35.080 --> 38:37.310
- Okay.
- I'll be your maid of honor.

38:37.382 --> 38:39.714
It's gonna be great.

38:39.785 --> 38:41.980
It's gonna be great.

38:45.056 --> 38:47.388
Whew.

38:48.460 --> 38:51.122
<i>Hey, can I make a suggestion?</i>

38:51.196 --> 38:54.859
Have you ever heard
of"pee-not gree-gio"?

38:54.933 --> 38:56.992
<i>It's this really nice white wine.</i>

38:57.068 --> 38:59.628
It's very elegant.

38:59.704 --> 39:01.638
Mmm.

39:01.706 --> 39:03.640
- Now, your music is-
- Yes.

39:03.708 --> 39:08.805
still pending, and, sadly, D.J. Humble
is no longer available on that date.

39:08.880 --> 39:13.078
Oh? But he and I had a deal- in principle.

39:13.151 --> 39:15.085
Yes, well, one of
my other brides outbid you.

39:15.153 --> 39:17.815
<i>I can't give you</i>
<i>her name, of course.</i>

39:17.889 --> 39:20.357
That bitch!

39:20.425 --> 39:22.825
Not you. No, a different one.

39:22.894 --> 39:25.419
A person.

39:28.900 --> 39:31.528
God, she's scary.

39:31.603 --> 39:33.503
- You don't think that Liv-
- Yeah, I do.

39:33.572 --> 39:35.597
No. No. She knew
how much that meant to me.

39:35.674 --> 39:38.871
- It's too cruel. It's too mean-spirited.
- Too in character?

39:40.445 --> 39:42.379
Hang on. Wait.

39:42.447 --> 39:45.280
Didn't you tell me
she's wearing a Vera Wang?

39:45.350 --> 39:48.751
- Yes.
- I read those run really tight...

39:48.820 --> 39:51.380
and she's kind of an ex-heifer.

39:51.456 --> 39:53.686
No. No, she's-

39:53.758 --> 39:55.885
She's- Little bit.

40:00.832 --> 40:03.027
Mmm. Oh!

40:03.101 --> 40:06.468
That is good. Excellent.

40:06.538 --> 40:08.904
Is that like cream cheese?
It <i>is</i> cream cheese.

40:08.974 --> 40:10.908
Like a hint.

40:10.976 --> 40:14.377
- Has Emma chosen her cake yet?
- Let's keep to our own work, shall we?

40:14.446 --> 40:17.415
Now, as for the flowers,
Eufloria has put in a bid.

40:17.482 --> 40:20.883
We just can't have the same cake, that's all.
And I have to have the seven-tiered...

40:20.952 --> 40:26.913
white chocolate-curl torte, enrobed
in marzipan with edible pearls and flourishes.

40:26.992 --> 40:28.926
Well, you're safe.

40:28.994 --> 40:31.622
Emma has chosen
a less extravagant cake.

40:31.696 --> 40:34.028
And she's always saying
that she doesn't need...

40:34.099 --> 40:36.260
to impress people
with how much she can spend.

40:36.334 --> 40:40.566
- I'm just going to check my ice sculptor Rolodex.
- Right.

40:41.640 --> 40:43.835
Oh, my God.

40:43.909 --> 40:45.968
That was a dig at me.

40:48.480 --> 40:51.142
Emma thinks I'm showing off?

40:52.817 --> 40:56.048
I never thought she resented how much
money I made, but I guess I was wrong.

40:56.121 --> 40:58.112
Really? I didn't get that
from what she-

40:58.189 --> 41:00.384
Marion's eating it up.

41:00.458 --> 41:02.688
She likes Emma best.

41:02.761 --> 41:06.128
Emma always gets the sympathy vote.
I never get the sympathy vote, do I?

41:06.197 --> 41:08.427
Well, maybe it's asking
a little bit too much of people-

41:08.500 --> 41:12.630
I was worried about her cake. It could be
two Ding-Dongs and a Yodel for all I care.

41:18.276 --> 41:20.210
What's that? What's that?

41:23.348 --> 41:25.543
Don't-

41:30.989 --> 41:32.957
<i>Dance lessons?</i>

41:33.024 --> 41:36.824
Damn, she's competitive.
Their dance is totally gonna be better than ours.

41:36.895 --> 41:40.729
Let me see Canary Song again.
Dandelion. Canary.

41:40.799 --> 41:43.962
- Isn't there something in between?
- Sort of like a burnt Canary.

41:44.035 --> 41:47.027
Video montage of their lives? Really?

41:47.105 --> 41:48.697
<i>- It's gotta be Fletcher's idea.</i>
- That's just-

41:48.773 --> 41:51.071
It's gonna be, like,
pictures of them as babies.

41:51.142 --> 41:53.076
You know, Emma with one tooth...

41:53.144 --> 41:55.738
and Fletcher in his little
superhero outfits. It's tacky.

41:55.814 --> 41:57.873
Can I help you?

41:57.949 --> 42:00.679
- Yeah. Delivery for Liv Lerner.
- That's chocolate.

42:01.786 --> 42:03.720
I'll take that.

42:03.788 --> 42:05.779
Mmm. Looks good.

42:05.857 --> 42:08.519
"Liv, you deserve this and more."

42:08.593 --> 42:10.527
Isn't Daniel the sweetest?

42:10.595 --> 42:12.256
- I'll just have one.
- Thanks.

42:12.330 --> 42:14.389
Just one.

42:17.435 --> 42:19.460
<i>- W-Was she up there?</i>
- Yeah.

42:19.537 --> 42:22.904
- Oh. And it's impossible to go get them back?
- No, no, no, no.

42:22.974 --> 42:25.602
She ate half the box already, lady.
Forty-five dollars.

42:25.677 --> 42:27.668
Yes. Okay.

42:27.746 --> 42:30.374
That is the agreed upon-

42:30.448 --> 42:32.382
But just so you know-

42:32.450 --> 42:36.386
if you heard what was actually
going on, you would totally side with me.

42:36.454 --> 42:39.184
- You gonna tip me?
- I thought that was including tip...

42:39.257 --> 42:42.693
but anyway, I'll give it to you
because I'm the Paula.

42:43.695 --> 42:45.629
You know, I've been thinking.

42:45.697 --> 42:48.235
- If you really want to mess
with Emma's first dance-

42:48.236 --> 42:48.564
Mm-hmm?

42:48.633 --> 42:50.931
- There are ways.
- Tell me more.

42:52.170 --> 42:55.230
I don't know, baby. Dance class?

42:55.306 --> 42:57.900
Come on. We know how to dance.

42:57.976 --> 43:00.240
It's a slow dance.
It's like we did in college.

43:00.311 --> 43:04.179
It's a waltz. It's a little more precise
than just holding each other up.

43:04.249 --> 43:06.581
And besides, Marion says
that our first dance...

43:06.651 --> 43:10.018
- introduces our couple style to the world.
- Oh, well, naturally...

43:10.088 --> 43:12.989
I'm incredibly concerned with our couple style.

43:13.058 --> 43:15.583
<i>Space!</i>

43:19.064 --> 43:21.123
I am Ricky Coo...

43:21.199 --> 43:23.997
the Doctor of Dance.

43:24.069 --> 43:26.833
I bring you motion.
I bring you rhythm.

43:26.905 --> 43:29.772
I bring you <i>sex.</i>

43:29.841 --> 43:32.935
<i>Please, get on your feet,</i>
<i>and let's dance!</i>

43:33.011 --> 43:35.673
<i># Y'all ready for this? #</i>

43:41.453 --> 43:43.387
<i># Dance #</i>

43:43.455 --> 43:45.389
<i># Dance #</i>

43:45.457 --> 43:47.448
<i># Dance #</i>

43:53.465 --> 43:58.164
Maybe Marion shouldn't be recommending
Ricky Coo, Doctor of Dance so much.

43:58.236 --> 44:00.170
Yeah. I don't know about Ricky.

44:00.238 --> 44:03.469
<i>Good for you. Doing warm-ups.</i>

44:03.541 --> 44:08.171
Yeah, I got your voice mail saying you wanted
to push the lesson from 1:00 to 4:00.

44:08.246 --> 44:09.941
How long have you been here?

44:11.483 --> 44:14.509
Oh, my God.

44:14.586 --> 44:16.884
- What?
- Liv.

44:18.990 --> 44:22.790
- Uh, just give us a second.
<i>- I mean, who does that?</i>

44:22.861 --> 44:27.298
She's finally gone completely crazy.
Not that I'm surprised at all.

44:27.365 --> 44:31.233
- I mean, she's always been nuts.
- I know. And messing with our couple style?

44:31.302 --> 44:34.135
- There is no way I'm letting her get away with that.
- Good.

44:34.205 --> 44:37.606
You know who I feel sorry for is Daniel.

44:37.675 --> 44:41.577
He's not even gonna
be able to control his own wife.

44:41.646 --> 44:44.809
What?

44:44.883 --> 44:47.739
No, I'm just saying- It's Liv.
Because she never thinks about-

44:47.740 --> 44:48.011
And?

44:48.086 --> 44:50.281
- I'm going inside.
- What?

44:50.355 --> 44:54.155
<i> The final month</i>
<i>before the big day is a litmus test for couples...</i>

44:54.225 --> 44:58.662
<i>of how they work together,</i>
<i>solve problems, communicate.</i>

44:58.730 --> 45:04.430
<i>The early, happy glow is over,</i>
<i>and the nerves begin to set in.</i>

45:04.502 --> 45:09.565
<i>With some couples, it brings out the</i>
<i>fundamental conflicts in their relationship.</i>

45:09.641 --> 45:12.906
<i>With other couples, the lucky ones...</i>

45:12.977 --> 45:16.811
<i>it highlights the essential harmony</i>
<i>of their partnership.</i>

45:16.881 --> 45:20.908
<i>Of course, even the luckiest bride</i>
<i>needs something to take the edge off.</i>

45:21.219 --> 45:25.019
Ooh, for me! A Jolly Walrus cookie bouquet.
Is Daniel a keeper or what?

45:25.089 --> 45:27.819
I'd just be careful.
Miss Wang is a stern mistress.

45:27.892 --> 45:31.123
Video montage- If there's gonna be
live pictures and, like, video footage-

45:31.196 --> 45:33.221
I know. It's, like, verging on
being a digital short.

45:33.298 --> 45:37.132
I don't know how they're gonna
cut me out of the footage. I'm in everything.

45:37.202 --> 45:39.568
Oh, this came for you via messenger.

45:39.637 --> 45:41.730
I can't wait to get into this one.

45:41.806 --> 45:45.640
Mr. Simmons called again asking
for the update on the agreement.

45:45.710 --> 45:49.612
<i>- Rutherford Press?</i> That's my hometown.
- I'm just gonna take this.

45:49.681 --> 45:51.808
Suppose I should just tell them
you're dealing with a crisis?

45:51.883 --> 45:54.408
Oh, my God.

45:54.485 --> 45:57.716
They still print
engagement announcements.

45:57.789 --> 45:59.780
I'm sort of like a celebrity
back there, probably.

45:59.858 --> 46:04.488
You know, it's like, local girl
makes good. Such sweet people.

46:04.562 --> 46:06.757
- Oh, wow!
- What the?

46:06.831 --> 46:09.595
<i>That's not you. Is it?</i>

46:09.667 --> 46:12.227
Emma looks gorgeous.

46:12.303 --> 46:14.669
- But not on the inside, which is-
- Kevin.

46:15.940 --> 46:18.807
It's the best she can do, huh?

46:18.877 --> 46:21.207
So lame. She wants to
play dirty? I can play dirty.

46:22.580 --> 46:24.241
You <i>can</i> play dirty.
I've seen you do it.

46:24.315 --> 46:26.283
I went to law school, people.

46:26.351 --> 46:28.285
I'm starting to think
that 30 is the cutoff.

46:28.353 --> 46:28.608
Mmm.

46:28.609 --> 46:32.619
Because it's the last time
men want to date women their age.

46:32.690 --> 46:35.022
A 30-year-old guy will
date a 30-year-old girl.

46:35.093 --> 46:37.027
But a 35-year-old guy
wants someone 30.

46:37.095 --> 46:40.758
A 40-year-old guy
wants someone 30, too, or 28.

46:40.832 --> 46:42.766
- Mm-hmm.
- It's a terrible planet.

46:42.834 --> 46:46.031
I know. You know
what I was wondering?

46:46.104 --> 46:48.572
What are the real reasons behind
Emma and Fletcher having to tie the knot?

46:48.640 --> 46:52.303
Why can't they change their date?
Think about it.

46:55.346 --> 46:57.814
She's pregnant! Emma's pregnant!

46:59.918 --> 47:03.376
Oh, no.

47:03.454 --> 47:07.015
- Oh, no!
- Liv?

47:07.091 --> 47:10.117
Are you all right? What the hell is goin' on?

47:10.194 --> 47:12.128
<i>Look, let me in!</i>

47:12.196 --> 47:14.994
I gained five pounds.
Five pounds. It might as well be 50!

47:15.066 --> 47:17.000
The dress doesn't fit!
And if the dress doesn't fit...

47:17.068 --> 47:22.096
my wedding's gonna be
a big black hole in the history of the Plaza!

47:22.173 --> 47:24.733
<i>Well, "A"it's</i> our <i>wedding, hon.</i>

47:24.809 --> 47:26.970
And "B"...so what? Let it out.

47:27.045 --> 47:30.674
You don't alter Vera Wang to fit you.

47:30.748 --> 47:33.808
You alter yourself to fit Vera.

47:33.885 --> 47:36.547
- What do boys learn in school?
<i>- Sorry.</i>

47:36.621 --> 47:38.851
<i>It's not the end of the world.</i>

47:38.923 --> 47:42.825
Really. What-What-What can I do
to make you feel better?

47:42.894 --> 47:46.591
It's what you can stop doing.
This is all your fault.

47:46.664 --> 47:51.033
- It's sweet of you to send me those treats, but l-
- What treats?

47:53.237 --> 47:55.865
You know, the treats.
The Truffle-opolis.

47:56.975 --> 47:58.738
The truffle tray.

47:59.811 --> 48:02.075
The Jolly Walrus cookie bouquet?

48:03.314 --> 48:05.248
International Butter Club?

48:05.316 --> 48:09.082
The- Honey-
I didn't send you any of that.

48:09.153 --> 48:11.883
Oh, my God, Emma!

48:11.956 --> 48:14.447
She's trying to make me fat
so I can't fit into my dress!

48:14.525 --> 48:16.720
What is that? What is that?

48:23.267 --> 48:25.201
The International Butter Club?

48:25.269 --> 48:27.737
You mean, you've actually
been sitting around...

48:27.805 --> 48:30.467
eating sticks of butter
from different lands?

48:35.346 --> 48:39.510
<i>The final week before the
wedding is do-or-die.</i>

48:39.584 --> 48:43.179
<i>I expect my brides to be flawless.</i>

48:43.254 --> 48:47.554
<i>Perfect hair, skin, nails, everything.</i>

48:47.625 --> 48:51.026
Hello there.
I need to get to the back really fast.

48:51.095 --> 48:53.495
Really, really fast, because
I left something there yesterday.

48:53.564 --> 48:55.725
- It's very important that l-
- I so don't care.

48:56.801 --> 48:59.292
Go on back.

49:04.642 --> 49:06.041
<i>- Miss Allan.</i>
- Oh, hi.

49:06.110 --> 49:08.135
Hi. Bit of Honey today?
That's the one I loaded.

49:08.212 --> 49:11.670
Yes, but, uh, just a pre-wedding glow.

49:11.749 --> 49:13.683
- Sure thing.
- Okay, thanks.

49:13.751 --> 49:16.584
<i># I wish you well #</i>

49:16.654 --> 49:20.818
<i># I hope you survive #</i>

49:20.892 --> 49:23.827
<i># I hope you live on, baby #</i>

49:23.895 --> 49:26.090
<i># So I can watch you cry #</i>

49:26.164 --> 49:28.098
<i># 'Cause I know</i>
<i>in time you'll see #</i>

49:28.166 --> 49:30.794
<i># What you did to me #</i>

49:30.868 --> 49:33.530
<i># And you'll come runnin' back #</i>

49:33.604 --> 49:37.563
<i># I'm gonna rain</i>
<i>on your parade #</i>

49:37.642 --> 49:40.941
<i># Oh, I won't take it again #</i>

49:41.012 --> 49:44.709
<i># And I'll keep raining, raining, raining #</i>

49:44.782 --> 49:47.580
<i># Over you #</i>

49:47.652 --> 49:49.711
Wow!

49:49.787 --> 49:53.883
<i>What happened to you?</i>
<i>You look like a traffic cone.</i>

49:53.958 --> 49:56.358
<i>Will it fade?</i>

49:56.427 --> 49:59.760
<i>Sort of. </i>
<i>This is three loofahs.</i>

49:59.831 --> 50:03.790
Is it that bad? Fletch said
he didn't think it was that bad.

50:03.868 --> 50:06.530
Oh, well, honey,
"Filch" is your fiancé.

50:06.604 --> 50:08.538
He probably told you
you had nice hair too.

50:10.308 --> 50:12.776
<i>This wedding stuff
is not a walk in the park.</i>

50:12.844 --> 50:14.778
<i>- For sure.</i>
<i>- I'm surprised. I don't know.</i>

50:14.846 --> 50:18.077
I'm surprised I haven't been, you know,
sent into my therapist's office.

50:18.149 --> 50:19.980
That's what I've heard. T-U-F-F.

50:20.051 --> 50:21.985
You should have heard me
on the phone the other day...

50:22.053 --> 50:23.824
talking to the guy
who messed up my centerpieces.

50:23.825 --> 50:24.214
Oh, gosh.

50:24.288 --> 50:27.018
It was unbelievable. It's like one thing
after another, every single time.

50:27.091 --> 50:29.685
- It snowballs.
- Listen, can I get a little bit more lowlight?

50:29.760 --> 50:32.627
Yeah, especially right here. Hold that thought,
sweetie. I'm gonna get your color.

50:32.697 --> 50:36.326
Just make sure it's not so-
Like, more gold base.

50:36.400 --> 50:39.392
<i># I'm gonna rain</i>
<i>on your parade #</i>

50:39.470 --> 50:43.065
<i># No, I won't take it again #</i>

50:43.141 --> 50:48.272
<i># And I'll keep raining, raining, raining</i>
<i>over you #</i>

50:50.081 --> 50:52.015
Maybe I should take up chanting.

50:52.083 --> 50:55.177
I think it's kind of- might be
necessary at this time of my life.

50:59.490 --> 51:03.859
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God. Is it good?

51:03.928 --> 51:06.123
Great!

51:06.197 --> 51:08.631
I get to do noth-

51:11.936 --> 51:14.404
Okay. I-I don't know
what happened. Um-

51:14.472 --> 51:17.270
I gotta let it sit for a day or two.

51:17.341 --> 51:19.104
Maybe I'll try to strip it down to white.

51:19.177 --> 51:21.611
My hair's blue!

51:21.679 --> 51:25.843
It's blue! I have blue hair!

51:25.917 --> 51:28.545
- I'm getting married in a week.
- Congratulations.

51:28.619 --> 51:30.746
In a week! A week!

51:32.223 --> 51:34.157
Come on. I know you're in here.

51:34.225 --> 51:36.159
Ah, here's your video montage.

51:38.696 --> 51:40.721
Oh, yeah.

51:40.798 --> 51:42.698
Absolutely.

51:46.671 --> 51:48.730
<i>Fletch?</i>

51:50.641 --> 51:52.939
Bug? Do you have something
you need to tell me?

51:53.010 --> 51:56.571
- Um-
- Are we about to have a little orange baby?

51:56.647 --> 52:00.413
<i>Apparently we're registered</i>
<i>at Babies "R" Us.</i>

52:00.484 --> 52:03.510
<i>Isn't that nice?</i>

52:03.588 --> 52:07.046
Marissa. Where are you?
I can barely hear you.

52:08.059 --> 52:10.152
I can't believe you told Emma.

52:10.228 --> 52:12.287
Whatever.

52:12.363 --> 52:15.264
You guys, don't get too
attached to the dancers.

52:15.333 --> 52:17.460
They're paid to be nice to you.

52:17.535 --> 52:20.698
- Yeah!
<i>- # New York and Japan #</i>

52:20.771 --> 52:22.864
Hello, bride!

52:22.940 --> 52:27.172
<i> All right, all right.</i>
<i>Now a little birdie has just told me...</i>

52:27.245 --> 52:29.338
that we have a bride-to-be
in the house tonight.

52:29.413 --> 52:33.850
- Over here!
<i>- But she has been a very bad bride.</i>

52:33.918 --> 52:37.319
<i>Officer Not-Your-Husband</i>
<i>is here to arrest you!</i>

52:37.388 --> 52:40.619
<i># I'm a model, You know what I mean #</i>

52:40.691 --> 52:44.627
<i>- # And I do my little turn on the catwalk ## </i>
- You're under arrest...

52:44.695 --> 52:48.187
for being too sexy.

52:50.301 --> 52:52.496
Time to be frisked.

52:53.904 --> 52:55.997
Oh, my goodness!

52:57.675 --> 52:58.835
Great!

53:00.478 --> 53:05.677
We got two brides
in the house tonight!

53:07.251 --> 53:09.742
<i>Whoa. Whoa, whoa.
Hold up!</i>

53:09.820 --> 53:11.219
We have two brides
in the house tonight.

53:11.289 --> 53:13.757
Emma, this party is invitation only.

53:13.824 --> 53:17.089
I'm getting married too, baby!

53:17.161 --> 53:19.220
<i>Well, I'll invite you right up there.</i>

53:19.297 --> 53:22.755
<i>- DJ Jazzles invites bride number two up on stage.</i>
- Why not?

53:22.833 --> 53:26.269
<i>Come on up here, girl!</i>
<i>We want to see the way you move!</i>

53:26.337 --> 53:29.568
<i>That's what I'm talking about!</i>
<i>Work it out, girl!</i>

53:29.640 --> 53:31.904
You can't even let me
have my own bachelorette party?

53:31.976 --> 53:36.538
Much the way you couldn't let me
have DJ Humble. That was low, Liv.

53:36.614 --> 53:41.415
By the way, did you hear?
I'm not pregnant, okay?

53:41.485 --> 53:44.010
I say it's time for a dance-off. Dance-off!

53:44.088 --> 53:47.956
Dance-off! Dance-off!
Dance-off! Dance-off!

53:51.062 --> 53:54.259
<i># You say I'm so crazy #</i>

53:56.167 --> 53:59.364
<i>- # Coming home intoxicated #</i>
- Oh! Oh!

53:59.437 --> 54:01.371
<i>- # I say I just want to love you #</i>
<i>- Come on, Liv!</i>

54:01.439 --> 54:03.373
<i># I just wanna love you, baby #</i>

54:03.441 --> 54:06.069
- Aw, come on, Liv.
<i>- Come on, bride number one.</i>

54:06.143 --> 54:09.601
- I know y'all can do better than that.
<i>- # Give it to me, baby #</i>

54:09.680 --> 54:12.012
Sprockets!

54:18.622 --> 54:22.615
<i>Break it down! Now the sexiest bride</i>
<i>takes first prize. Let's see it!</i>

54:22.693 --> 54:27.392
<i>We gonna get this party started, y'all!</i>

54:28.566 --> 54:30.090
<i>Showdown!</i>

54:36.140 --> 54:39.109
Space!

54:40.644 --> 54:42.737
<i>Check out bride number two!</i>

54:42.813 --> 54:45.304
<i># They be watchin' while we wiggle around</i>
<i>Look at 'em droolin'# </i>

54:45.383 --> 54:47.647
<i># They ain't used to this sound</i>
<i>I keep 'em movin'# </i>

54:47.718 --> 54:50.414
<i># All my ladies put your hands in the air</i>
<i>It's all right now #</i>

54:50.488 --> 54:52.752
<i># We gon' keep you up on your feet</i>
<i>the whole night now #</i>

54:52.823 --> 54:54.688
<i># Pop them bottles</i>
<i>Yeah, drink that up, man #</i>

54:54.759 --> 54:57.193
<i># Got you feelin' crazy</i>
<i>Well, that was the plan #</i>

54:57.261 --> 54:59.286
<i># They was waitin' for me</i>
<i>Wasn't ready for this #</i>

54:59.363 --> 55:01.831
<i># He got the game sewed up</i>
<i>No, I'm talkin' bout Swiss #</i>

55:01.899 --> 55:03.833
<i>- # Why would you try #</i>

55:03.901 --> 55:06.267
<i># We got 'em shakin' everything</i>
<i>from the hood to Dubai #</i>

55:06.337 --> 55:11.604
<i>Bride number two, you are</i>
<i>the sexiest bride of the night, baby.</i>

55:11.675 --> 55:14.269
<i>Give it up for bride number two, y'all!</i>

55:15.713 --> 55:18.307
<i>Sorry, bride number one.</i>
<i>Can't win 'em all, girl.</i>

55:29.226 --> 55:33.322
It's weird, losing.
I gotta say I'm not loving it.

55:33.397 --> 55:35.331
No, but you were both so good.

55:35.399 --> 55:37.993
Yeah, you really got up there, and you tried.

55:38.068 --> 55:41.970
- Forget it. It's my bachelorette party, right?
- Yes.

55:43.974 --> 55:45.805
Good girl. Here you go.

55:45.876 --> 55:48.071
It's like you read my mind.

55:55.186 --> 55:58.019
Oh, my God!

55:58.088 --> 55:59.988
Oh, my God!

56:02.927 --> 56:04.952
Taxi! Taxi.

56:07.298 --> 56:10.893
Kevin. Kevin. I need coffee.

56:10.968 --> 56:14.199
Excuse me. I need coffee.
I need three Advil.

56:14.271 --> 56:16.205
Yeah. Four waters.

56:16.273 --> 56:19.333
Get a splash of that Kahlúa
next to wherever that paralegal is.

56:19.410 --> 56:21.344
- Hey, Elana.
- Good morning.

56:21.412 --> 56:23.154
You work too hard.
I'm gonna treat you to lunch.

56:23.155 --> 56:23.403
Okay.

56:23.481 --> 56:26.006
- Where are you, Kev? Are you in the office?
- I hear you coming. Liv?

56:26.083 --> 56:27.948
- Liv, blue! Hair!
- Hey, Advil.

56:28.018 --> 56:30.179
You have blue hair!

56:32.523 --> 56:34.957
Oh, my God. I totally forgot.

56:35.025 --> 56:37.858
I was supposed to get it
dyed back at 7:00.

56:37.928 --> 56:40.954
I think it's very- It's gonna be-
They're gonna love it.

56:41.031 --> 56:43.056
I got it. I'm gonna figure it out.

56:43.133 --> 56:47.297
<i>If we could all refer to the briefs I've drawn up.</i>
<i>I've highlighted a few main points.</i>

56:47.371 --> 56:50.363
<i>Our discovery process in depositions</i>
<i>and document requests-</i>

56:50.441 --> 56:53.274
maybe you guys could share that one-
has yielded significant results.

56:53.344 --> 56:57.872
W-W-Wait. Okay. I am looking
at the brief dated two weeks ago.

56:57.948 --> 57:00.314
<i>- Where is the latest version?</i>
- I could have sworn that I updated these.

57:01.552 --> 57:04.112
Just a second.

57:04.188 --> 57:06.122
Goddamn it!

57:06.190 --> 57:07.885
Your hair.

57:07.958 --> 57:11.894
Yes, my hair. My hair... is blue!

57:11.962 --> 57:14.328
My hair is blue. My wedding's in a week,
and I'm paying my maid of honor.

57:14.398 --> 57:16.332
Okay? Or rather Mr. Colson is.

57:16.400 --> 57:18.925
<i>And, yes, maybe</i>
<i>I misplaced the brief!</i>

57:19.003 --> 57:23.406
And, yes, maybe my best friend
in the world forever hates me!

57:23.474 --> 57:25.408
Hates me!

57:32.983 --> 57:36.475
Oh, my God.

57:36.554 --> 57:39.887
I'm gonna be a bald bride.

57:41.926 --> 57:44.156
It's so not ideal.

57:44.228 --> 57:46.253
This is who's representing us?

57:46.330 --> 57:50.699
Not anymore. Miss Lerner's off the case.
I'm taking over.

57:50.768 --> 57:54.636
No, now look, calm down.
I'm gonna get it dyed back.

57:55.773 --> 57:58.139
Miss Lerner.

57:58.208 --> 58:00.301
You are excused.

58:03.047 --> 58:06.210
I'm not this girl.

58:08.919 --> 58:12.047
<i>I just don't screw up.</i>
<i>I just don't get demoted.</i>

58:12.122 --> 58:16.218
It's like I don't have anybody.
I feel so alone.

58:17.962 --> 58:20.453
Hey.

58:20.531 --> 58:22.522
Babe, I'm right here.

58:27.938 --> 58:32.875
You miss your friend,
especially now.

58:32.943 --> 58:35.207
She'd know just what to say.

58:35.279 --> 58:37.577
I'm mad at her too.

58:37.648 --> 58:43.348
She went for the hair.
Girlfriends don't do that.

58:43.420 --> 58:47.083
You'll fix it. And if you can't, I love it.

58:47.157 --> 58:51.924
I do. You're like this very tall,
very hot Smurf.

58:55.432 --> 58:58.401
Oh, honey.

59:00.437 --> 59:02.371
It's not just about the hair.

59:05.042 --> 59:07.602
I'm mad because maybe she's right.

59:09.213 --> 59:12.944
And it's exhausting having to
try to be perfect all the time.

59:13.017 --> 59:17.249
That's how I held it together
ever since I was a kid.

59:17.321 --> 59:21.519
I figured nothing- nothing bad
would happen again if I was just...

59:21.592 --> 59:25.926
one step ahead of everything
and everybody, all the time.

59:27.264 --> 59:30.324
Life isn't perfect, hon.

59:31.702 --> 59:34.102
It's messy.

59:37.041 --> 59:38.975
You're right.

59:40.044 --> 59:41.978
I mean, I was gonna be
perfect for you...

59:42.046 --> 59:44.344
but now that you say
it's impossible- Hey.

59:44.415 --> 59:49.148
No, you don't. No, you
don't have to be perfect.

59:49.219 --> 59:52.518
I've always wanted a human wife.

59:52.589 --> 59:56.582
Yeah, the other ones are just...
too hard to inflate.

01:00:01.331 --> 01:00:03.265
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:00:03.333 --> 01:00:05.699
- Almost back to normal, huh?
- I know, right?

01:00:05.769 --> 01:00:09.500
I have, like, one layer of skin left,
but that should be okay for our wedding.

01:00:09.573 --> 01:00:11.507
So, oops, sorry, Liv.

01:00:11.575 --> 01:00:14.305
<i>I wish I had pictures. You know?</i>

01:00:14.378 --> 01:00:18.974
It's like I was up there, and there's
this spotlight, and when I hit that rope-

01:00:19.049 --> 01:00:21.950
- Oh, my God!
- Hey! Enough, enough, enough!

01:00:22.019 --> 01:00:25.819
<i>I've heard this story</i>
<i>10,000 times, Emma.</i>

01:00:25.889 --> 01:00:28.153
You've been acting
a little wild lately. Okay?

01:00:28.225 --> 01:00:30.659
And I'm tired of it.
So knock it off.

01:00:30.728 --> 01:00:33.788
Lately you've been very mad
and tense and excited.

01:00:33.864 --> 01:00:35.798
<i>You know what? I just don't know</i>
<i>how to deal with this.</i>

01:00:35.866 --> 01:00:36.206
Uh-huh.

01:00:36.207 --> 01:00:39.267
And quite frankly, you have
me questioning whether or not...

01:00:39.336 --> 01:00:42.362
this is something about- to do with
the wedding or if this is permanent.

01:00:42.439 --> 01:00:45.533
Um, well, Fletcher, it is kind
of permanent. You know?

01:00:45.609 --> 01:00:49.545
It is possible that I might be mad or tense or
excited more than once in the next 40 years.

01:00:49.613 --> 01:00:51.672
Is it? Really? You know what?
You're doing it right now.

01:00:51.749 --> 01:00:56.049
- What?
- You're being, not, I mean, not bitchy, but-

01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:58.520
I said "not bitchy." But you're
right there in that neighborhood.

01:00:59.890 --> 01:01:01.824
You should have the cab,
like, take a U-turn...

01:01:01.892 --> 01:01:04.224
drop you off at Pleasant and Nice,
where we met.

01:01:04.294 --> 01:01:06.785
Are you upset because of this thing
with Liv, or because I'm having feelings?

01:01:06.864 --> 01:01:08.832
<i>- Totally.</i>
- Because it's kind of hard to read you.

01:01:08.899 --> 01:01:12.801
My God! That's totally it. I'm upset
because you have feelings. You nailed it.

01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:17.330
Okay. So in other words, then don't have
so many feelings, but if I do, don't show 'em.

01:01:17.407 --> 01:01:20.808
<i>- I shouldn't have so many-</i>
- Oh, God! I can't even talk to you right now!

01:01:20.878 --> 01:01:24.336
You haven't tried yet. Do you realize-
Do you know how hard this is for me?

01:01:24.414 --> 01:01:26.212
<i>I don't even know who you are.</i>

01:01:26.213 --> 01:01:29.078
You have not even tried to
ask me about how I'm feeling.

01:01:29.153 --> 01:01:32.384
- I'm so confused.
<i>- I don't even know who you are.</i>

01:01:34.324 --> 01:01:36.884
<i>All right? I don't want to talk.</i>

01:01:47.571 --> 01:01:50.768
<i>It's a tense time. We're fine.</i>
<i>Whatever. I was gonna go to the gym.</i>

01:01:50.841 --> 01:01:53.503
Bye.

01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:21.796
<i># The blank pages of my diary #</i>

01:02:21.872 --> 01:02:26.832
<i># That I haven't touched</i>
<i>since you left me #</i>

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:32.246
- Emma?
<i>- # The closed blinds in my home #</i>

01:02:32.316 --> 01:02:37.310
- Emma! Emma!
<i>- # See no light of day #</i>

01:02:37.387 --> 01:02:42.620
<i># Dust gathers on my stereo #</i>

01:02:42.693 --> 01:02:48.427
<i># 'Cause I can't bear</i>

01:02:48.498 --> 01:02:53.629
<i># The piano sits in a shady space #</i>

01:02:53.704 --> 01:02:58.607
<i># With a picture of your face #</i>

01:02:58.675 --> 01:03:03.578
<i>- # Coffee stains on your favorite book #</i>

01:03:03.647 --> 01:03:06.138
Liv Lerner's office.

01:03:06.216 --> 01:03:10.346
Hey, Kevin. It's Emma. Is Liv there?

01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:12.786
I'm sorry, can you hold on?
Just a minute, l- Sorry.

01:03:12.856 --> 01:03:14.915
It's my worst nightmare.
I'm "cubicle-ized."

01:03:14.992 --> 01:03:17.722
I'm sorry, Liv's dealing with a crisis
right now. Can we return?

01:03:19.763 --> 01:03:21.697
Fine. That's-

01:03:21.765 --> 01:03:24.290
Yeah. Okay, I get it. Bye.

01:03:24.368 --> 01:03:28.065
- Hey! I'm sorry. Who is this?
<i>- # I'm scared to face another day #</i>

01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:33.576
- Hello?
<i>- # 'Cause the fear in me just won't go away #</i>

01:03:33.644 --> 01:03:37.842
<i># In an instant, you were gone #</i>

01:03:37.915 --> 01:03:42.784
<i># And I'm scared ## </i>

01:03:52.129 --> 01:03:53.960
Hey!

01:03:55.032 --> 01:03:56.966
Hi!

01:03:57.034 --> 01:03:58.968
- How are you?
- Long time, huh?

01:03:59.036 --> 01:04:03.530
- I know. It's my fault. I've been really busy.
- Oh, yeah. Right. Busy.

01:04:03.607 --> 01:04:07.873
Nothing to do with the fact that I'm
the brother of your archenemy. I mean, best friend.

01:04:07.945 --> 01:04:10.470
Hey! I have to rent a tux.

01:04:10.547 --> 01:04:12.606
You're coming with me. Come on.

01:04:12.683 --> 01:04:14.617
- Um, okay.
- Come on.

01:04:14.685 --> 01:04:19.486
I'm a little surprised. I would have thought
a big magazine writer would have his own tux.

01:04:33.637 --> 01:04:37.596
How you doing, Em? Hmm?
How you feeling?

01:04:37.674 --> 01:04:40.871
Um, feel fine.

01:04:42.145 --> 01:04:44.079
Fine's not really a feeling though.

01:04:44.147 --> 01:04:46.843
Fine's a feeling.

01:04:46.917 --> 01:04:48.942
"I feel fine." You could say that.
People say that.

01:04:49.019 --> 01:04:51.317
Yeah, sure. You can say that.

01:04:52.489 --> 01:04:55.322
Okay. It's, like-

01:04:55.392 --> 01:04:57.553
Things are crazy with the wedding.

01:04:57.627 --> 01:05:01.961
And there are all these details
and... I don't know.

01:05:02.032 --> 01:05:05.627
I had this idea of how
it was gonna be in my head, and-

01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:10.931
- And it's not as much fun as that.
- Mm-hmm.

01:05:11.008 --> 01:05:13.738
And I don't know why.

01:05:16.146 --> 01:05:18.637
But mostly, I am fine.

01:05:20.584 --> 01:05:22.950
Let's fix your tie. I can't look at a tie like this.

01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:27.184
- Yeah. Change the subject.
- This doesn't look right without a tie.

01:05:27.257 --> 01:05:29.555
I'm gonna go with a clip-on
'cause I can't figure this out.

01:05:29.626 --> 01:05:32.254
- You have no patience.
- Really?

01:05:32.329 --> 01:05:34.263
Mm-mmm.

01:05:36.466 --> 01:05:38.627
Kind of think I wait
around too long.

01:05:43.473 --> 01:05:45.634
Hey, let me buy you a cup of coffee.

01:05:45.709 --> 01:05:49.167
Oh, um, I-I can't.
I'm late for, um-

01:05:49.246 --> 01:05:51.578
But I'll call you.

01:05:51.648 --> 01:05:56.017
Um, when I'm not-You-That-
You look, um, you look really-

01:05:56.086 --> 01:06:00.420
You're gonna make a very
handsome bride "giver-awayer."

01:06:00.490 --> 01:06:03.323
Thank you.

01:06:03.393 --> 01:06:05.452
And, Em, you're gonna make
a beautiful bride. Really.

01:06:06.863 --> 01:06:09.093
- Yeah?
<i>- Yeah. I always thought so.</i>

01:06:09.166 --> 01:06:11.634
Thanks. Bye.

01:06:37.461 --> 01:06:42.194
<i> Despite it all,</i>
<i>when morning broke on that sixth ofJune...</i>

01:06:42.265 --> 01:06:45.666
<i>it was the perfect day for a wedding.</i>

01:06:45.735 --> 01:06:47.669
<i>Well, two weddings.</i>

01:06:47.737 --> 01:06:50.205
T-minus three hours, people.

01:06:50.273 --> 01:06:53.674
Guard your camps, execute your duties,
and we may make it out of here alive.

01:06:53.743 --> 01:06:55.870
Incoming, people.

01:07:00.717 --> 01:07:02.685
Roses for Lerner.
Peonies for Allan.

01:07:02.752 --> 01:07:05.152
- Has the Allan officiant reported for duty yet?
- Yes, he has.

01:07:05.222 --> 01:07:06.382
- Linens for Lerner?
<i>- Yes.</i>

01:07:06.456 --> 01:07:07.855
Excellent.

01:07:07.924 --> 01:07:11.917
Let's move, people.
This is not a dress rehearsal.

01:07:11.995 --> 01:07:14.691
Amazing. You can't even
see the blue anymore.

01:07:20.337 --> 01:07:23.238
Oh, Liv.

01:07:23.306 --> 01:07:27.003
My God, you're the most
beautiful bride I have ever seen.

01:07:27.077 --> 01:07:28.874
Thank you.

01:07:28.945 --> 01:07:32.039
Oh, uh, excuse me a sec.

01:07:34.184 --> 01:07:36.118
She's so weird.

01:07:37.287 --> 01:07:40.620
God, I'm so nervous.
I don't know why.

01:07:40.690 --> 01:07:43.921
- Is the veil supposed to go like that?
- Yes. Why?

01:07:43.994 --> 01:07:46.758
Oh, no. You look fine.

01:07:46.830 --> 01:07:52.496
You know, honestly, the pressure
we put on brides these days to look perfect.

01:07:52.569 --> 01:07:54.867
It's just ridiculous.

01:07:54.938 --> 01:07:59.841
You don't have to look your most beautiful
on your wedding day. Okay, everybody?

01:07:59.910 --> 01:08:02.378
Mom!

01:08:02.445 --> 01:08:04.379
<i>You know, if you want my opinion-</i>

01:08:04.447 --> 01:08:07.746
You know what, Deb? I don't.
I don't want your opinion.

01:08:07.817 --> 01:08:10.650
Wh-What?

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:14.247
Deb, I have been dealing
with versions of you my whole life...

01:08:14.324 --> 01:08:16.258
and I'm gonna tell you something...

01:08:16.326 --> 01:08:18.294
that I should've told myself
a long time ago.

01:08:18.361 --> 01:08:20.022
Sometimes it's about me, okay?

01:08:20.095 --> 01:08:23.156
Not all the time, but every once
in a while it's my time. Like today.

01:08:23.233 --> 01:08:25.326
If you're not okay with that,
feel free to go.

01:08:25.402 --> 01:08:27.962
<i>But if you stay,</i>
<i>you have to do your job.</i>

01:08:28.037 --> 01:08:31.633
And that means smiling and talking
about my bridal beauty...

01:08:31.707 --> 01:08:33.676
and, most importantly,
not making it about you.

01:08:33.743 --> 01:08:35.676
Okay? Can you do that?

01:08:35.745 --> 01:08:38.179
Yes, I'd like to.

01:08:38.247 --> 01:08:40.511
Then we're good.

01:08:40.584 --> 01:08:43.178
Harpist is Allan. Quartet is Lerner.

01:08:43.252 --> 01:08:46.279
How many times
do I have to repeat myself?

01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:51.983
Check on the grooms' status
and man your battle stations.

01:08:51.984 --> 01:08:52.392
Okay.

01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:54.589
If you're about to jump ship
from one wedding...

01:08:54.663 --> 01:08:56.894
let someone else know
so we can create a diversion.

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:57.216
Okay.

01:08:57.216 --> 01:09:00.403
I'm going to Liv's ceremony
and Emma's reception. More booze.

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:03.404
I'm gonna do a quick head count of
the hot drunk single guys and then choose.

01:09:03.473 --> 01:09:06.408
- Good call.
- Allan. Lerner.

01:09:07.844 --> 01:09:10.779
Hey, Mr. Allan. How are you?

01:09:10.846 --> 01:09:13.179
- I'm good, bud. How're you?
- Big day, huh?

01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:14.808
Yes. Yes, it is.

01:09:14.884 --> 01:09:17.944
I caught a glimpse of Emma when
I was scouting out the enemy camp.

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:20.649
She is beautiful, sir.

01:09:20.724 --> 01:09:22.658
Thank you, Nathan.

01:09:22.725 --> 01:09:24.660
Listen, you think I could have
a word with your sister?

01:09:24.728 --> 01:09:27.959
- Not about the-the fight, about something else.
- Oh, yeah. Sure.

01:09:31.734 --> 01:09:33.669
Liv.

01:09:33.737 --> 01:09:37.194
Hi! Mr. Allan!

01:09:37.274 --> 01:09:39.902
Oh, Liv.

01:09:41.278 --> 01:09:43.542
Wow. Your mom and dad
would be so proud.

01:09:43.613 --> 01:09:46.810
- Thank you.
- Of both of you.

01:09:46.883 --> 01:09:48.975
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

01:09:49.051 --> 01:09:52.215
I just want to pass on a blessing
from our generation.

01:09:52.288 --> 01:09:55.588
Not just from myself but from...

01:09:57.193 --> 01:10:02.563
f-from my dear friends who would've
given anything to be here today.

01:10:03.633 --> 01:10:06.261
- Good luck, sweetheart.
- Oh.

01:10:06.336 --> 01:10:08.463
- Nate.
- Mr. Allan, thank you.

01:10:08.538 --> 01:10:09.937
- Good to see you.
- All right.

01:10:10.006 --> 01:10:12.497
You too.

01:10:12.575 --> 01:10:16.739
Such a good man.
Emma's so much like him.

01:10:16.813 --> 01:10:21.773
So, according to Ms. St. Claire,
you are allowed one weak nip...

01:10:21.851 --> 01:10:23.785
before the wedding,
to sort of steady the nerves.

01:10:23.853 --> 01:10:27.380
- So we have scotch-
- Okay. Scotch is good.

01:10:27.457 --> 01:10:29.425
We have vodka and tequila.

01:10:29.492 --> 01:10:31.722
Tequila, tequila?
Tequila! Tequila!

01:10:31.795 --> 01:10:34.423
- Kevin! Tequila.
- Tequila's so trashy.

01:10:34.497 --> 01:10:37.933
- No, no, no. Kevin. Kevin, listen to me.
- You don't even like tequila.

01:10:38.001 --> 01:10:40.435
You take this to Marion.
You tell her I switched the DVD's.

01:10:40.503 --> 01:10:42.437
She needs to play this
when Emma walks down the aisle.

01:10:42.505 --> 01:10:44.632
I thought we were rising
above this sort of thing.

01:10:44.708 --> 01:10:47.506
We are, which is why I need you
to do this for me right now. Hurry!

01:10:53.883 --> 01:10:55.817
You'll thank me one day.

01:10:55.885 --> 01:10:58.115
I'll go get that.

01:10:58.188 --> 01:10:59.712
- That's very helpful.
<i>- Okay.</i>

01:10:59.789 --> 01:11:00.778
Thank you.

01:11:00.857 --> 01:11:03.485
Oh, my God. It's your parents.

01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:06.757
<i>Come on in. Look,</i>
<i>isn't she a bridal beauty?</i>

01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:10.231
<i>She sure is. Oh, my gosh.</i>

01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:13.997
- Oh, wow, Mom.
- Oh, my God! Is that my dress?

01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:16.766
Are you happy?

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:18.774
I'm happy if you're happy.

01:11:18.842 --> 01:11:22.039
Sweetheart, you could get married
in a brown paper bag, I wouldn't care.

01:11:22.112 --> 01:11:24.979
This is your day.

01:11:27.050 --> 01:11:30.076
Oh, boy, I need a tissue.

01:11:30.153 --> 01:11:33.486
- Oh, my God. I'm gonna cry.
- You're gonna screw up your makeup, honey.

01:11:33.556 --> 01:11:36.992
I found this when we moved
to Boca, and I saved it.

01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:40.325
- Dad. What is it?
- I knew there'd come a day to give it to you.

01:11:43.733 --> 01:11:47.134
<i>Go ahead. Open it.</i>

01:11:54.043 --> 01:11:56.807
In case you need
something old or blue.

01:11:59.182 --> 01:12:01.116
It's really Liv's.

01:12:01.184 --> 01:12:04.017
Well, something borrowed then.

01:12:12.796 --> 01:12:14.730
Daddy, I need to see her.

01:12:14.798 --> 01:12:17.858
I think she feels the same way.

01:12:17.934 --> 01:12:20.232
I'll get that.

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:25.908
Oh, it's Marion.

01:12:25.975 --> 01:12:29.536
Uh, places, people.
We're on in two.

01:12:29.612 --> 01:12:33.070
Marion, could I just run
down the hallway for a second?

01:12:33.149 --> 01:12:38.314
Emma, you are the most beautiful bride
I have ever seen. Ready.

01:12:38.388 --> 01:12:41.357
- Bride one, walking. Bride one, walking.
- Oh.

01:12:47.864 --> 01:12:50.526
<i># I was a little girl #</i>

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:54.001
<i># Alone in my little world #</i>

01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:58.439
<i>- # Who dreamed of a little home for me #</i>
- It's time.

01:13:00.610 --> 01:13:03.841
<i># I played pretend</i>
<i>between the trees #</i>

01:13:03.913 --> 01:13:07.110
<i># And fed my houseguests</i>
<i>bark and leaves #</i>

01:13:07.183 --> 01:13:11.643
<i># And laughed in</i>
<i>my pretty bed of green #</i>

01:13:12.856 --> 01:13:16.053
<i># I had a dream #</i>

01:13:16.125 --> 01:13:18.685
<i># That I could fly #</i>

01:13:18.761 --> 01:13:22.754
<i># From the highest swing #</i>

01:13:22.832 --> 01:13:25.164
<i># I had a dream #</i>

01:13:33.776 --> 01:13:37.644
<i># Ooh ## </i>

01:13:55.798 --> 01:13:57.925
<i>Ma'am.</i>

01:14:12.415 --> 01:14:14.007
- Oh, my God.
- Okay. Okay.

01:14:14.083 --> 01:14:16.779
- I'm getting married.
- Yeah. Are you happy?

01:14:16.853 --> 01:14:18.844
Uh-

01:14:18.922 --> 01:14:21.891
<i> When I get</i>
<i>visual confirmation on bride one walking...</i>

01:14:21.958 --> 01:14:23.926
give video a five count and roll.

01:14:23.993 --> 01:14:27.087
<i>And ready.</i>

01:14:28.731 --> 01:14:30.665
<i>Walk.</i>

01:14:48.017 --> 01:14:51.783
<i>I'm in Acapulco, baby!
Spring break!</i>

01:14:51.854 --> 01:14:56.382
I'm here with Miguel.

01:14:58.861 --> 01:15:01.227
<i>I love spring break!</i>
<i>I want to dance!</i>

01:15:01.297 --> 01:15:05.063
<i>Go, Emma!
Go, Emma!</i>

01:15:07.937 --> 01:15:10.565
<i>- I love being Emma!</i>
- l-

01:15:25.488 --> 01:15:27.422
We've been hit.
Repeat, we've been hit.

01:15:43.439 --> 01:15:46.340
<i>- Emma!</i>

01:15:46.409 --> 01:15:48.536
<i>Let me tell you something
about that tape!</i>

01:15:48.611 --> 01:15:54.572
God, you swore! You swore
you'd never show that to anyone.

01:15:55.852 --> 01:15:58.787
Just... let them go.

01:15:58.855 --> 01:15:59.947
Emma!

01:16:00.023 --> 01:16:02.389
Bring it on!

01:16:02.458 --> 01:16:05.859
<i>Emma! I don't want to fight!</i>

01:16:05.928 --> 01:16:10.058
- Let me just tell you something!
- I don't want to fight!

01:16:11.167 --> 01:16:14.136
It's over. I can't do this anymore.

01:16:15.805 --> 01:16:18.740
<i>I can't do this anymore.</i>

01:16:29.285 --> 01:16:31.810
Thank God.

01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:20.294
I'm fine.

01:17:22.371 --> 01:17:25.135
Emma, what the hell
are you doing? Have you lost your mind?

01:17:25.208 --> 01:17:27.301
You just ruined our wedding.
You happy now?

01:17:27.376 --> 01:17:30.675
Your friend? History. 'Cause she's a bad
influence on you, and she always has been.

01:17:30.747 --> 01:17:33.341
Judging by that DVD, you're
a lot more like her than I thought.

01:17:33.416 --> 01:17:36.544
- Good. I hope so.
- What?

01:17:36.619 --> 01:17:39.713
Fletcher, you've been
my friend for 10 years.

01:17:39.789 --> 01:17:43.122
I need you to be my friend now
and tell me the truth.

01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:47.461
You're in love with a girl
that you met 10 years ago.

01:17:47.530 --> 01:17:50.897
Hey, what's the matter with that? Huh?

01:17:50.967 --> 01:17:54.300
She's not here anymore.

01:17:56.305 --> 01:18:00.002
I don't want to spend
the rest of my life fighting, Fletch.

01:18:00.076 --> 01:18:02.010
Or caving.

01:18:03.246 --> 01:18:05.180
Neither do you.

01:18:09.986 --> 01:18:13.353
We're different.
We want different things.

01:18:17.293 --> 01:18:19.523
You know that's true, don't you?

01:18:24.734 --> 01:18:26.668
I knew.

01:18:48.291 --> 01:18:50.225
Good-bye.

01:18:53.596 --> 01:18:56.394
Oh, my God. Emma.

01:19:03.673 --> 01:19:06.699
I'm fine.

01:19:06.776 --> 01:19:09.540
This is all my fault.
That video was never supposed to happen.

01:19:09.612 --> 01:19:13.207
<i>I mean, it was supposed to</i>
<i>happen, but I canceled it. I thought I did.</i>

01:19:13.282 --> 01:19:16.410
'Cause I could never do that to you.
Emma, you're my best friend.

01:19:16.485 --> 01:19:19.249
<i>Oh, this fighting is so dumb.</i>

01:19:22.225 --> 01:19:25.285
I'm so sorry about everything.

01:19:28.231 --> 01:19:31.894
I'm sorry... too.

01:19:31.968 --> 01:19:34.596
I'm so sorry.

01:19:36.539 --> 01:19:40.100
If I ruined it for you,
I don't want it anymore.

01:19:40.176 --> 01:19:45.136
If Fletcher and I were perfect
for each other, then...

01:19:46.215 --> 01:19:50.083
we'd be getting married, and we're not.

01:19:53.322 --> 01:19:55.415
Are you crying?

01:19:55.491 --> 01:19:57.584
Yeah. It's like a whole new me.

01:19:57.660 --> 01:20:01.255
And I just- I cry all the time.

01:20:01.330 --> 01:20:05.926
- I'm kind of a basket case.
- No, Liv, I didn't want that. I'm sorry.

01:20:06.002 --> 01:20:08.664
No. No, you were right.

01:20:08.738 --> 01:20:12.037
I don't have to have it
constantly together all the time.

01:20:13.109 --> 01:20:17.546
It's like... this huge wake-up call.

01:20:17.613 --> 01:20:20.741
And I'm kind of stumbling around
a little bit, but...

01:20:21.951 --> 01:20:24.010
I'm awake.

01:20:26.389 --> 01:20:28.983
Will you stand up there with me?

01:20:30.192 --> 01:20:32.456
Where else would I be?

01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:45.000
Reset, people. Reset.

01:20:56.052 --> 01:20:59.681
Oh, I almost forgot something.

01:20:59.755 --> 01:21:04.488
Oh, my God. Em?
Where did you find that?

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:06.494
Two little girls saved it for us.

01:21:09.932 --> 01:21:11.524
Come on.

01:21:37.593 --> 01:21:39.652
Hi.

01:21:39.729 --> 01:21:43.961
- Hey. Are you single?
- Uh, yeah.

01:21:44.033 --> 01:21:46.695
- Are you straight?
- I don't like labels.

01:21:49.672 --> 01:21:52.334
So sorry to hear about your divorce.

01:21:52.408 --> 01:21:55.070
Why? It was only my first.

01:21:55.144 --> 01:21:58.045
And next time, I'm definitely
getting married at the Plaza.

01:21:58.114 --> 01:22:03.643
<i># You treated me so kind</i>
<i>I'm about to lose my mind #</i>

01:22:03.719 --> 01:22:07.416
<i>- # You made me so #</i>
<i>- # Very happy #</i>

01:22:08.491 --> 01:22:09.753
- Do you wanna dance?
- Yes.

01:22:09.825 --> 01:22:12.487
- Let's go.
- Okay.

01:22:19.969 --> 01:22:22.369
Um-

01:22:22.438 --> 01:22:26.374
No, baby. Baby,
let it happen on its own.

01:22:26.442 --> 01:22:31.607
Uh-oh. Did I make a horrible mistake and
marry someone who's smarter than I am?

01:22:35.084 --> 01:22:37.018
<i>It was quite a wedding.</i>

01:22:37.086 --> 01:22:40.055
<i>And as I stood there watching...</i>

01:22:40.122 --> 01:22:44.115
<i>I realized something</i>
<i>I'd forgotten a long time ago.</i>

01:22:44.193 --> 01:22:49.961
# You made me so very happy ##

01:22:50.032 --> 01:22:55.493
<i>Sometimes in life there really are</i>
<i>bonds formed that can never be broken.</i>

01:22:56.772 --> 01:23:01.141
<i>Sometimes, you really can</i>
<i>find that one person...</i>

01:23:01.210 --> 01:23:04.646
<i>who will stand by you</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

01:23:04.713 --> 01:23:09.776
<i>Maybe you'll find it in a spouse</i>
<i>and celebrate it with your dream wedding.</i>

01:23:11.187 --> 01:23:13.155
<i>But there's also the chance...</i>

01:23:13.222 --> 01:23:17.886
<i>that the one person</i>
<i>you can count on for a lifetime-</i>

01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:20.485
<i>the one person who knows you...</i>

01:23:20.563 --> 01:23:23.532
<i>sometimes better</i>
<i>than you know yourself-</i>

01:23:23.599 --> 01:23:28.798
<i>is the same person who's been</i>
<i>standing beside you all along.</i>

01:23:39.915 --> 01:23:43.180
- Wow! You look great.
- Hello. Oh, my God. You look great.

01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:47.580
Well, how was it?
How was the vacation?

01:23:47.656 --> 01:23:50.090
- It was amazing.
- I want to know everything about it.

01:23:50.159 --> 01:23:51.922
Actually, I don't.
You married my brother. That's weird.

01:23:51.994 --> 01:23:53.757
So I don't want
to know anything, ever.

01:23:55.698 --> 01:23:57.893
Should we toast? To marriage?

01:23:57.967 --> 01:24:00.527
Um, actually, I'm not drinking.

01:24:03.906 --> 01:24:06.898
Neither am I.

01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:10.374
Are you pregnant?

01:24:10.446 --> 01:24:11.777
- When are-
- Me too. March third.

01:24:11.847 --> 01:24:14.714
When're you due? March third.

01:24:17.553 --> 01:24:19.919
