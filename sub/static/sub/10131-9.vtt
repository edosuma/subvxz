08:39.727 --> 08:41.271

08:39.727 --> 08:41.271
someone to play with.

08:42.939 --> 08:44.483
Not that I'm complaining.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.942
No, of course not.

08:45.984 --> 08:48.403
D.J., in my pre-alcove days

08:48.445 --> 08:50.613
I lived like a king.

08:50.655 --> 08:52.615
I had my own door

08:52.657 --> 08:55.285
four walls and a light switch.

08:55.327 --> 08:56.786
It was Camelot.

Not that I'm complaining.

Well, in my pre-Stephanie days

09:02.000 --> 09:04.585

09:13.178 --> 09:14.929
is all yours.

Thanks, D.J.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.393
But I keep my socks

09:17.724 --> 09:19.393
in the glove compartment.

09:21.186 --> 09:22.687
If you really wanna do

09:21.186 --> 09:22.687
me a favor, you can get me

09:22.729 --> 09:24.772
another glass of water

09:22.729 --> 09:24.772
so I can finish washing

09:24.814 --> 09:26.233

09:38.203 --> 09:39.620
alone in the cold garage

09:42.040 --> 09:43.041

Dad, Joey has no

09:51.632 --> 09:54.802
place to rehearse.

09:54.844 --> 09:57.180
Isn't there something we

09:54.844 --> 09:57.180
can all do to help him?

09:57.222 --> 09:59.807
What Joey really needs

09:57.222 --> 09:59.807
is his own room.

09:59.849 --> 10:01.809
Yes, you're right.

09:59.849 --> 10:01.809
Joey needs a room.

10:01.851 --> 10:03.395
Okay, let's stop

10:01.851 --> 10:03.395
and think about this.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.231
Darn, no rooms.

10:06.273 --> 10:07.648
Oh, well, we thought about it.

10:09.192 --> 10:11.152

Huh?

- Daddy.

- What?

Time out, Stephanie.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.709
a little talk

10:26.751 --> 10:28.878
about this lookout thing.

10:28.920 --> 10:32.340
The key is to let us know

10:28.920 --> 10:32.340
when Joey<i> is</i> coming

10:32.382 --> 10:33.716
not when Joey

10:32.382 --> 10:33.716
is not coming.

10:35.009 --> 10:37.262
This is harder

10:35.009 --> 10:37.262
than I thought.

10:37.304 --> 10:38.846
No, sweetie, it's easy.

10:38.888 --> 10:41.141
All you have to do

10:38.888 --> 10:41.141
is when you see Joey coming

10:41.182 --> 10:43.602
you give us

10:41.182 --> 10:43.602
the secret code.

10:43.643 --> 10:47.105
Um, "the duck

"The duck flies

10:47.147 --> 10:49.483

10:49.524 --> 10:51.067
I should get

10:49.524 --> 10:51.067
paid for this.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.490
Okay, I got this

10:53.987 --> 10:56.490
all figured out.

10:56.531 --> 10:58.617
Now if I move into

10:56.531 --> 10:58.617
Michelle's room

10:58.658 --> 11:01.369
Joey moves into my room,

10:58.658 --> 11:01.369
Michelle moves into the alcove

11:01.411 --> 11:04.456
and Stephanie gets her very own

11:01.411 --> 11:04.456

I don't think so.

If we put bunk beds

11:09.544 --> 11:11.963

11:12.005 --> 11:13.131
that means Uncle Jesse and Joey

11:13.173 --> 11:14.174
could be roommates.

21:57.316 --> 21:58.818
Am I still getting

21:57.316 --> 21:58.818
my mail here

21:58.859 --> 22:00.444
or did you forward it

21:58.859 --> 22:00.444
to the gutter?

22:06.200 --> 22:07.785
'I didn't demand

22:06.200 --> 22:07.785
to move in here.'

22:07.827 --> 22:09.203
I volunteered to help out.

22:09.245 --> 22:10.246
If you didn't

22:09.245 --> 22:10.246
need my help

22:10.288 --> 22:11.664
all you had to say was..

22:19.130 --> 22:20.923
...Joey is an idiot.

22:25.178 --> 22:26.179
Oh, ho-ho!

22:27.847 --> 22:30.432
I got a bathroom,

22:27.847 --> 22:30.432
my jets

22:30.474 --> 22:32.434
manny, my bed.

22:34.603 --> 22:35.980
I love it!

22:36.022 --> 22:37.023
You deserve it!

22:38.816 --> 22:40.776
How did you guys

22:38.816 --> 22:40.776
get my old furniture?

22:40.818 --> 22:42.653
Your mom.

22:42.695 --> 22:44.404
What happened to all

22:42.695 --> 22:44.404
the junk that was down here?

22:44.446 --> 22:45.614
Attic.

22:45.656 --> 22:46.699
Where's your motorcycle?

22:46.740 --> 22:48.034
Back yard.

22:48.075 --> 22:49.743
Hey, where we gonna

22:48.075 --> 22:49.743
park our cars?

22:49.785 --> 22:50.870
Street.

22:52.454 --> 22:53.831
This was the garage?

22:55.124 --> 22:56.667
Danny, this must have

22:55.124 --> 22:56.667
cost a fortune.

22:58.794 --> 22:59.920
Don't ask.

23:01.088 --> 23:03.757
Joey, you're my best friend

23:03.799 --> 23:05.218
and you're doing me

23:03.799 --> 23:05.218
the biggest favor

23:05.259 --> 23:07.803
of my life by helping me

23:05.259 --> 23:07.803
raise my girls.

23:07.845 --> 23:10.264
This is just our way

23:07.845 --> 23:10.264
of saying thanks.

23:14.143 --> 23:16.312
No one has ever done

23:16.354 --> 23:17.980
anything like this

23:16.354 --> 23:17.980
for me before.

23:20.524 --> 23:21.734
And the best part is

23:22.776 --> 23:24.070
as great as my new room is

23:24.111 --> 23:25.863
you guys<i> really</i> want me here.

23:26.697 --> 23:28.282
Are you kidding?

23:28.324 --> 23:30.243
You're a part

23:28.324 --> 23:30.243
of our family.

23:30.284 --> 23:32.410
Face it, pal.

23:30.284 --> 23:32.410
You're a Tanner.

23:32.452 --> 23:33.954
[laughs]

23:35.622 --> 23:36.999
Welcome home, Joseph.

23:37.041 --> 23:38.876
Tomorrow, you're

23:37.041 --> 23:38.876
on the day shift.

23:40.627 --> 23:42.171
Steph, I got great news.

23:42.213 --> 23:44.340
This means you can

23:42.213 --> 23:44.340
move into the alcove!

23:45.632 --> 23:49.011
You're too good to me.

23:45.632 --> 23:49.011
It's all yours.

23:52.556 --> 23:54.767
Thanks for the room, everybody.

23:54.808 --> 23:57.353
Forward your mail

23:54.808 --> 23:57.353
to the gutter, huh?

23:57.395 --> 24:00.106
Fling your stuff

23:57.395 --> 24:00.106
on the lawn, huh?

24:00.147 --> 24:01.607
I was kidding.

24:00.147 --> 24:01.607
I'm a comedian.

24:01.648 --> 24:02.816
I'm in the kidding business.

24:02.858 --> 24:04.277
Kid this, buddy.
