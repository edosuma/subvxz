WEBVTT

00:12.367 --> 00:14.067
PREVIOUSLY ON
"GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:14.100 --> 00:17.033
MEREDITH WASN'T A FLING.
I FELL IN LOVE WITH HER.

00:17.067 --> 00:19.300
YEAH, IT'S MY MOTHER.
SHE HAS ALZHEIMER'S.

00:19.333 --> 00:22.733
HAVE YOU EVEN BOTHERED
TO TELL BURKE ABOUT THE BABY?
I HAD A RIGHT TO KNOW.

00:22.767 --> 00:24.533
I FAILED THE MEDICAL BOARDS.

00:24.567 --> 00:25.700
THAT'S PRETTY EMBARRASSING.

00:25.733 --> 00:28.300
I'M PREGNANT,
YOU BLIND MORON.

00:28.333 --> 00:30.500
CAN WE PLEASE JUST TALK?

00:30.533 --> 00:32.200
YOU'RE TOO BUSY
SCREWING NURSES TO TALK.

00:32.233 --> 00:34.467
I NEVER WANTED TO HURT YOU.

00:34.500 --> 00:36.567
SOMETIMES I THINK WE'D BE
BETTER OFF WITH DOGS.

00:36.600 --> 00:39.267
(Doc barks)

00:41.200 --> 00:44.100
***

00:47.600 --> 00:51.400
(Doc barking)

00:51.433 --> 00:52.600
(indistinct shouting)

00:52.633 --> 00:54.300
(glass shatters)

00:54.333 --> 00:57.333
(George) I SAID DOWN!
IZZIE! IZZIE!

00:57.367 --> 01:02.467
(barking continues)

01:02.500 --> 01:03.833
(Meredith) FRESH STARTS--

01:03.867 --> 01:05.567
THANKS TO THE CALENDAR,

01:05.600 --> 01:06.567
THEY HAPPEN EVERY YEAR.

01:06.600 --> 01:09.533
JUST SET YOUR WATCH
TO JANUARY.

01:09.567 --> 01:11.433
YOU KNOW, I'M THINKING
ABOUT COLORING MY HAIR.

01:11.467 --> 01:12.667
MAYBE RED.

01:12.700 --> 01:14.433
RED'S GOOD.

01:14.467 --> 01:16.367
I'M THINKING
ABOUT CUTTING MINE.

01:16.400 --> 01:18.300
YEAH?
YOU'D LOOK GOOD SHORTER.

01:18.333 --> 01:20.367
YOU THINK?
YEAH.

01:20.400 --> 01:21.567
(barking stops)

01:21.600 --> 01:23.500
(Meredith) OH,
HE'S SUCH A GOOD DOG.

01:23.533 --> 01:25.433
WHO'S A GOOD BOY?
HE'S A GOOD BOY.

01:25.467 --> 01:28.600
WHAT A GOOD DOG.
WHO'S MOMMY'S LITTLE BOY?

01:28.633 --> 01:30.667
OH, WHAT A GOOD BOY.

01:30.700 --> 01:33.167
YOU'RE SUCH A GOOD BOY.

01:33.200 --> 01:34.667
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING IN THERE?

01:34.700 --> 01:37.067
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE.
WE NEED TO TALK
ABOUT THE DOG.

01:37.100 --> 01:38.600
THAT'S NOT A DOG.

01:38.633 --> 01:40.533
IT'S A HYENA ESCAPED FROM
THE ZOO DRESSED IN DOG CLOTHING.

01:40.567 --> 01:41.667
WHATEVER. I DON'T
CHEW UP HIS CLOTHES.

01:41.700 --> 01:43.400
I DON'T URINATE
ON HIS BED.

01:43.433 --> 01:45.333
I DON'T TRY TO MOUNT HIM
FROM BEHIND.

01:45.367 --> 01:47.300
PEOPLE, HE'S OUR DOG.
WE LOVE OUR DOG.

01:47.333 --> 01:48.733
HE LOVES US.

01:48.767 --> 01:52.133
YEAH, GOOD DOG.
YOU'RE SUCH A GOOD DOG.

01:53.767 --> 01:55.533
(growls)

01:55.567 --> 01:57.567
(barks)

01:57.600 --> 02:00.400
HE TRIES TO MOUNT YOU
FROM BEHIND?
TRIES TO.

02:00.433 --> 02:01.633
(barking continues)

02:01.667 --> 02:03.233
HE TRIES TO.

02:03.267 --> 02:04.367
(barks)

02:04.400 --> 02:07.233
***

02:08.500 --> 02:11.733
OUR REWARD FOR SURVIVING
THE HOLIDAY SEASON

02:11.767 --> 02:12.933
IS A NEW YEAR,

02:12.967 --> 02:16.233
BRINGING ON THE GREAT TRADITION
OF NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTIONS.

02:16.267 --> 02:17.767
I GOT A TROUT.

02:17.800 --> 02:18.800
OH!

02:18.833 --> 02:21.533
RAINBOW TROUT.

02:21.567 --> 02:23.500
WHY--WHY DID YOU BRING
A TROUT INTO THE HOUSE?
THE TRAILER.

02:23.533 --> 02:26.500
WHY DID YOU BRING A RAINBOW
TROUT INTO THE TRAILER?
BREAKFAST.

02:26.533 --> 02:28.400
BREAKFAST?
YEAH, YOU HUNGRY?

02:28.433 --> 02:30.533
FOR TROUT?
YEAH.

02:30.567 --> 02:33.067
I HATE THIS, DEREK.

02:33.067 --> 02:33.833
I--

02:33.867 --> 02:34.833
OH!

02:34.867 --> 02:36.767
I HATE THIS! HATE, HATE.

02:36.800 --> 02:39.067
I HATE THIS TRAILER!

02:39.067 --> 02:40.800
SO NO TROUT FOR YOU THEN.

02:40.833 --> 02:44.067
PUT YOUR PAST BEHIND YOU
AND START OVER.

02:44.067 --> 02:46.467
I'M STANDING THERE
WITH PRITCHARD AND LEWIS,

02:46.500 --> 02:49.367
AND THEY KEEP ON ASKING ME
WHO I WAS WITH

02:49.400 --> 02:51.467
IN THE ON CALL ROOM
LAST NIGHT.

02:51.500 --> 02:53.367
THEY HEARD US.

02:53.400 --> 02:55.333
WERE WE THAT LOUD?

02:55.367 --> 02:57.067
Y-YOU'RE LOUD.

02:57.067 --> 02:58.833
STOP.

02:58.867 --> 03:00.733
I AM LOUD, AREN'T I?

03:00.767 --> 03:03.833
PRITCH. HE WAS ALWAYS
STICKING HIS NOSE

03:03.867 --> 03:05.533
IN SOMEONE ELSE'S BUSINESS.

03:05.567 --> 03:07.600
YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY
SAW HIM AGAIN,

03:07.633 --> 03:08.833
AT HIS WIFE'S FUNERAL?

03:08.867 --> 03:12.300
WHAT?
PRITCHARD ISN'T MARRIED.

03:12.333 --> 03:16.133
UH, OH, RIGHT, RIGHT.
I'M THINKING OF SOMEONE ELSE.

03:16.167 --> 03:18.100
I'M JUST CONFUSED.

03:18.133 --> 03:19.800
YOU NEED SLEEP.

03:19.833 --> 03:22.267
RESIDENCY
HAS WORN YOU DOWN.

03:25.133 --> 03:26.733
ELLIS, UM...

03:26.767 --> 03:27.800
YES.

03:33.767 --> 03:35.267
NOTHING.

03:35.300 --> 03:36.467
I JUST...

03:36.500 --> 03:38.433
HATE BEING AN INTERN.

03:38.467 --> 03:42.100
HMM. ME, TOO.

03:42.133 --> 03:45.333
IT'S HARD TO RESIST THE CHANCE
AT A NEW BEGINNING,

03:45.367 --> 03:48.767
A CHANCE TO PUT THE PROBLEMS
OF LAST YEAR TO BED.

03:53.367 --> 03:56.400
SO... IN THE NAME
OF THE NEW YEAR--

03:56.433 --> 03:58.267
OH, HUH,
I DON'T DO RESOLUTIONS.

03:58.300 --> 04:00.200
IN THE NAME OF THE NEW YEAR,

04:00.233 --> 04:03.567
I THOUGHT YOU COULD GIVE ME
AN ANSWER TO MY QUESTION.

04:03.600 --> 04:05.267
YOUR QUESTION?

04:05.300 --> 04:07.100
ABOUT YOU...

04:07.133 --> 04:08.633
MOVING IN.

04:08.667 --> 04:09.600
(sighs)

04:09.633 --> 04:11.533
I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER.

04:11.567 --> 04:12.333
CRISTINA--

04:12.367 --> 04:14.633
I'M NOT BEING CRISTINA,
I JUST...

04:14.667 --> 04:16.633
I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER.

04:16.667 --> 04:19.300
THEN ANSWER ME THIS,

04:19.333 --> 04:21.233
WHAT WERE YOU PLANNING
TO DO?

04:21.267 --> 04:22.667
ABOUT WHAT?

04:22.700 --> 04:24.333
THE BABY.

04:27.333 --> 04:30.200
DR. BURKE,
WE'RE READY FOR YOU.

04:37.800 --> 04:40.667
(Richard) LISTEN UP, PEOPLE,
NEW YEAR, NEW RULES.

04:40.700 --> 04:42.567
OR SHOULD I SAY, NEW YEAR,

04:42.600 --> 04:45.467
AND WE WILL BE
ENFORCING THE RULES

04:45.500 --> 04:47.367
MANDATED BY
THE RESIDENCY REVIEW COMMITTEE.

04:47.400 --> 04:49.533
THERE WERE TOO MANY MISTAKES
MADE LAST YEAR.

04:49.567 --> 04:52.167
FATIGUE PLAYED TOO BIG A ROLE.

04:52.200 --> 04:55.067
EXCEEDING 80 HOURS OF WORK PER
WEEK WILL NOT BE TOLERATED...

04:55.067 --> 04:56.800
DOES THAT MEAN WE ACTUALLY
GET TO HAVE A LIFE?

04:56.833 --> 04:58.167
I THINK SO.

04:58.200 --> 05:00.100
...SULLIVAN, YOU WERE ON CALL
FOR 28 HOURS.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.300
LEAVE WHEN YOU HIT 30.

05:02.333 --> 05:04.700
GREY, YOU WERE HERE
UNTIL 2 A.M. LAST NIGHT,

05:04.733 --> 05:06.633
SEE YOU AT NOON.
I GET TO GO?
FREE TIME?

05:06.667 --> 05:08.567
RUN BEFORE HE CHANGES
HIS MIND.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.833
OH, AND, PEOPLE, OUR NURSES
ARE GONNA HAVE TO WORK

05:10.867 --> 05:13.467
EXTRA HOURS TO COMPENSATE,
SO TREAT THEM WELL.

05:13.500 --> 05:15.400
CRANKY NURSES DON'T DO US
ANY GOOD.

05:15.433 --> 05:17.333
OH, WELL, MAYBE YOU
CAN CHEER THEM UP.
(chuckles)

05:17.367 --> 05:18.833
YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:18.867 --> 05:21.733
MY NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION
WAS TO LET IT GO, AND I AM.

05:21.767 --> 05:23.667
I HAVE.
I'VE LET IT GO.

05:23.700 --> 05:25.067
I APOLOGIZE.
YOU DO?

05:25.067 --> 05:27.533
I DO.
HOW'D YOUR TEST GO?

05:27.567 --> 05:28.733
I FEEL PRETTY GOOD
ABOUT IT,

05:28.767 --> 05:30.667
BUT I WON'T KNOW
FOR A FEW DAYS.

05:30.700 --> 05:32.600
WE'RE ALL PULLING
FOR YOU.
WE ARE?

05:32.633 --> 05:34.067
WE ARE.

05:34.067 --> 05:37.100
YOU CAN SEE
THE MESOTHELIOMA BETTER

05:37.133 --> 05:40.800
NOW THAT I'VE
PARTIALLY DISSECTED IT.

05:40.833 --> 05:42.633
UH, I CAN'T, UH,

05:42.667 --> 05:44.567
I CAN'T REALLY SEE IT
FROM HERE.

05:44.600 --> 05:46.500
CAN I--
CAN I GO IN CLOSER?

05:46.533 --> 05:47.700
YOU'RE FINE THERE.

05:47.733 --> 05:49.400
PRESTON, GOOD NEWS.

05:49.433 --> 05:51.333
WE HAVE A HEART
FOR DENNY DUQUETTE.

05:51.367 --> 05:53.267
THAT'S GREAT NEWS.
HAS HE BEEN CALLED?

05:53.300 --> 05:55.200
GOT HERE TEN MINUTES AGO.
WELL, GOOD.

05:55.233 --> 05:57.767
I WAS WORRIED WE COULDN'T FIND
A MATCH IN TIME.

05:57.800 --> 06:00.667
WE HAVE A PLANE READY TO
TAKE YOU TO TWIN FALLS, IDAHO,

06:00.700 --> 06:02.767
FOR THE ORGAN RECOVERY--
90 MINUTES EACH WAY.

06:02.800 --> 06:04.567
HOW MUCH MORE
DO YOU HAVE HERE?

06:04.600 --> 06:06.700
WELL, THE HEART
COMES OUT FIRST.

06:06.733 --> 06:09.600
NO, I'D BE CUTTING IT
TOO CLOSE.
THEY HAVE A LOCAL
HEART TEAM THERE, SO--

06:09.633 --> 06:12.533
NO, BAILEY. SEND BAILEY.
SHE'LL BE OUR EYES.

06:12.567 --> 06:15.400
DR. YANG, YOU NEED
TO LEAVE THIS O.R.

06:15.433 --> 06:17.333
EXCUSE ME?

06:17.367 --> 06:19.400
YOU'VE EXCEEDED YOUR
80-HOUR LIMIT FOR THE WEEK.

06:19.433 --> 06:21.333
YOU HAVE TO LEAVE
THE HOSPITAL.

06:21.367 --> 06:22.833
OKAY, UM, UM, AS SOON

06:22.867 --> 06:24.767
AS THE MESOTHELIOMA'S
DISSECTED OUT.

06:24.800 --> 06:27.767
DR. YANG, NOW.

06:29.800 --> 06:31.600
YOU HEARD HIM.

06:31.633 --> 06:34.067
(clears throat)

06:36.600 --> 06:37.767
DENNY DUQUETTE.

06:37.800 --> 06:39.467
HEY, DR. BAILEY.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.367
I HOPE SEEING YOU HERE MEANS
THEY FINALLY FOUND YOU A HEART.

06:42.400 --> 06:45.233
NO OFFENSE, DOCTOR, BUT I'M
NOT A BIG FAN OF HOSPITALS.

06:45.267 --> 06:46.433
IT'D TAKE SOMETHING
PRETTY SPECIAL

06:46.467 --> 06:48.067
TO GET ME IN HERE.

06:48.100 --> 06:50.067
AND WHAT DO WE KNOW
ABOUT MR. DUQUETTE?

06:50.067 --> 06:52.100
CAPRICORN, SINGLE,

06:52.133 --> 06:53.633
LOVES TO TRAVEL
AND COOK.

06:53.667 --> 06:54.767
DENNY, BE QUIET.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.467
LET HER SHOW OFF.

06:56.500 --> 06:59.467
DENNY DUQUETTE, 36, ADMITTED
TODAY FOR A HEART TRANSPLANT

06:59.500 --> 07:01.200
NECESSITATED BY
A VIRAL CARDIOMYOPATHY.

07:01.233 --> 07:02.533
(Miranda) AND WHAT
DOES THAT MEAN?

07:02.567 --> 07:05.433
THAT HIS HEART IS UNABLE
TO FILL AND PUMP BLOOD NORMALLY.

07:05.467 --> 07:07.500
GOOD. DENNY,
THIS IS DR. STEVENS.

07:07.533 --> 07:10.733
SHE'LL BE TENDING TO YOU
PRIOR TO SURGERY.

07:10.767 --> 07:13.667
SO I GUESS I'LL BE
SEEING YOU AROUND, DR. STEVENS.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.467
WELL, I GOTTA HAND IT
TO THE GUY,

07:17.500 --> 07:20.367
TRYING TO GET SOME ACTION
WHEN HE'S PRACTICALLY A CORPSE.

07:20.400 --> 07:22.300
ALEX, HE WAS JUST TRYING
TO BE NICE.

07:22.333 --> 07:24.200
NO ONE ENFORCED AN 80-HOUR
WORK WEEK WHEN I WAS AN INTERN.

07:24.233 --> 07:26.133
110, 120 HOURS
SUITED ME JUST FINE.

07:26.167 --> 07:28.067
I LEARNED MORE
'CAUSE I WORKED MORE.

07:28.100 --> 07:29.267
WELL, AT LEAST THIS WAY,

07:29.300 --> 07:31.200
YOU GET TO REST
BEFORE YOU HAVE THE BABY.

07:31.233 --> 07:33.133
I MEAN, BEING THAT PREGNANT,
KEEPING UP THIS PACE...

07:33.167 --> 07:35.067
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
I LOOK TIRED, O'MALLEY?

07:35.067 --> 07:36.567
NO, NOT--NOT TIRED, NO.

07:36.600 --> 07:39.067
YOU LOOK FRESH, SPRY.
YOU GLOW.

07:39.067 --> 07:41.067
WHAT... STOP NOW.

07:41.100 --> 07:43.600
O'MALLEY, GO DO AN INTAKE
ON ADDISON SHEPHERD'S PATIENT.

07:43.633 --> 07:44.800
(pager beeps)

07:44.833 --> 07:47.367
ADDISON.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.233
YOU DO GLOW.

07:49.267 --> 07:50.600
LIKE THE MOON.

07:50.633 --> 07:54.233
AND YOU CAN SPEND THE DAY
IN THE PIT, KAREV.

07:59.167 --> 08:01.067
(woman) I'M JUST TRYING
TO MAKE A POINT.

08:01.100 --> 08:02.600
I UNDERSTAND
YOUR POINT, HONEY.

08:02.633 --> 08:04.533
BUT YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE
WHAT BUCKMAN SAID.

08:04.567 --> 08:05.733
LOOK, I WANT--
DR. O'MALLEY.

08:05.767 --> 08:07.433
HI. UM,
MR. AND MRS. SINGLETON,

08:07.467 --> 08:09.367
REBECCA, THIS IS
DR. MONTGOMERY-SHEPHERD.

08:09.400 --> 08:10.633
YOU DON'T THINK
IT'S CANCER, DO YOU?

08:10.667 --> 08:12.300
BEX IS TOO YOUNG
FOR CANCER, RIGHT?

08:12.333 --> 08:14.267
MRS. SINGLETON, I'M JUST
GETTING UP TO SPEED.

08:14.300 --> 08:16.167
I'M SORRY. DR. O'MALLEY?
REBECCA'S BEEN ADMITTED
FOR--

08:16.200 --> 08:18.100
COULD YOU STOP
CALLING ME THAT?

08:18.133 --> 08:21.100
SHE PREFERS BEX,
NOT REBECCA.

08:21.133 --> 08:24.633
BEX HAS BEEN ADMITTED
FOR AN ULTRASOUND GUIDED BIOPSY

08:24.667 --> 08:27.433
ON AN ENLARGEMENT
OF A PELVIC LYMPH NODE.

08:27.467 --> 08:29.367
OKAY. BEX, YOU MIND
IF I CHECK IT OUT?

08:29.400 --> 08:32.467
OKAY, I'LL JUST, UM...

08:32.500 --> 08:34.467
IT'S A MINOR PROCEDURE, BEX.

08:34.500 --> 08:36.400
BUT WE'LL GIVE YOU
A LOCAL ANESTHETIC

08:36.433 --> 08:38.267
TO MANAGE THE PAIN.

08:41.733 --> 08:43.700
WHAT ARE YOU DRAWING?

08:43.733 --> 08:45.767
JUST A DUMB COMIC.

08:45.800 --> 08:48.167
YOU'RE REALLY TALENTED.

08:48.200 --> 08:50.633
IT'S BIG, I KNOW.

08:50.667 --> 08:52.567
IT JUST APPEARED ONE DAY.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.533
I'LL PERFORM A BIOPSY
THIS MORNING,

08:54.567 --> 08:56.233
AND DR. O'MALLEY WILL
HAVE TO TAKE SOME BLOOD

08:56.267 --> 08:57.367
SO HE CAN RUN SOME TESTS.

08:57.400 --> 09:00.133
AND THEN WE CAN START
TO GET YOU SOME ANSWERS, OKAY?

09:00.167 --> 09:02.400
MRS. SINGLETON,
THERE'S NO NEED TO PANIC.

09:02.433 --> 09:04.733
I'LL KEEP YOU POSTED
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.
THANK YOU.

09:04.767 --> 09:06.067
OKAY.

09:06.100 --> 09:07.600
SORRY ABOUT THIS,

09:07.633 --> 09:10.467
BUT I'M GONNA NEED THAT ARM
TO GET SOME BLOOD.

09:10.500 --> 09:12.667
I'LL BE QUICK.

09:25.100 --> 09:26.833
MR. PASKOWITZ,

09:26.867 --> 09:30.167
WE'VE LOCATED THE SOURCE
OF YOUR ABDOMINAL PAIN.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.433
THERE. IT'S CALLED A BEZOAR.

09:32.467 --> 09:33.433
BEZOAR, HUH?

09:33.467 --> 09:35.367
IT'S A CLUMP
OF FOREIGN MATTER

09:35.400 --> 09:38.200
THAT COULDN'T BE EXPELLED
WITH A PROKINETIC AGENT.

09:38.233 --> 09:39.567
I LOVE IT.

09:39.600 --> 09:42.500
IN A HOSPITAL, A LAXATIVE
IS A PROKINETIC AGENT.

09:42.533 --> 09:44.700
SO WHAT, YOU JUST GO UP
HIS BUTT AND GRAB IT?
BABY, PLEASE.

09:44.733 --> 09:47.633
ACTUALLY, WE WON'T BE ABLE
TO REACH IT THAT WAY.

09:47.667 --> 09:49.767
WE'LL HAVE TO GET IT
FROM HERE.

09:49.800 --> 09:52.467
SO, MAUER, TELL ME
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN EATING.

09:52.500 --> 09:56.367
GARBAGE. ABSOLUTE GARBAGE.

09:56.400 --> 10:00.133
COULD YOU BE MORE SPECIFIC?

10:02.333 --> 10:04.233
TELL HIM
WHAT YOU ATE, MAUER.

10:06.533 --> 10:08.433
HE'S A WRITER,

10:08.467 --> 10:09.633
SUFFERING FOR HIS ART.

10:09.667 --> 10:11.433
OKAY.

10:12.700 --> 10:14.433
HE ATE HIS NOVEL.

10:14.467 --> 10:15.700
UH, I'M SORRY. WHAT?

10:15.733 --> 10:17.433
I ATE MY NOVEL, OKAY?

10:17.467 --> 10:19.367
THE WHOLE DAMN THING.

10:19.400 --> 10:22.300
EVERY LAST PIECE OF THAT
UNMITIGATED CRAP.

10:31.200 --> 10:34.033
***

10:34.067 --> 10:38.500
(Woman) * NOBODY KNOWS
WHERE THEY MIGHT END UP *

10:38.533 --> 10:40.533
* NOBODY KNOWS

10:51.733 --> 10:53.833
* OH, OH

10:53.867 --> 10:57.733
* SUPPOSE YOU'LL NEVER KNOW

11:01.067 --> 11:02.533
THE LABS FOR BEX SINGLETON.

11:02.567 --> 11:03.600
ANYTHING?

11:03.633 --> 11:05.100
YEAH, HER HORMONE LEVELS--
ESTROGEN, PROGESTERONE--

11:05.133 --> 11:06.467
ARE SKY HIGH.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.400
HUH, THAT'S--
YOU DID A HISTORY, RIGHT?

11:08.433 --> 11:10.333
ANY MENTION
OF BIRTH CONTROL PILLS?

11:10.367 --> 11:12.267
NO, BUT HER PARENTS
WERE RIGHT THERE.

11:12.300 --> 11:13.633
TALK TO HER AGAIN.

11:13.667 --> 11:14.467
SHE HASN'T HIT PUBERTY YET.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.133
ISN'T IT WEIRD
SHE'D BE HAVING SEX?

11:16.167 --> 11:18.067
THESE DAYS, DR. O'MALLEY,
IT'S NOT THAT UNUSUAL.

11:18.100 --> 11:20.633
TALK TO THE PATIENT.

11:20.667 --> 11:22.333
DEREK.
HI, MORNING, RICHARD.

11:22.367 --> 11:23.533
YOU BUSY?

11:23.567 --> 11:25.467
NO. MY SURGERY
JUST GOT CANCELED. WHY?

11:25.500 --> 11:27.167
I NEED A FAVOR.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.100
SURE.

11:32.400 --> 11:35.133
HEY, BEX.

11:35.167 --> 11:36.667
YOUR MOM AND DAD...

11:36.700 --> 11:37.667
FOOD.

11:37.700 --> 11:38.733
GREAT.

11:40.733 --> 11:43.533
'CAUSE I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU.

11:43.567 --> 11:47.700
YOUR LAB, UH, WORK SHOW--

11:47.733 --> 11:50.067
HAVE YOU BEEN TAKING
BIRTH CONTROL PILLS?

11:51.533 --> 11:53.433
IF YOU TELL
MY MOM AND DAD, THEY--

11:53.467 --> 11:55.367
NO, I WON'T.

11:55.400 --> 11:57.400
I JUST, UH,
NEED TO KNOW WHY.

11:57.433 --> 11:59.333
DO YOU HAVE
A BOYFRIEND OR...

11:59.367 --> 12:02.233
LIKE ANYBODY WOULD WANT
TO HAVE SEX WITH ME.

12:02.267 --> 12:04.333
WELL, THEN WHY?

12:05.600 --> 12:07.500
I'M AS FLAT AS A BOARD.

12:07.533 --> 12:09.533
I TOOK, LIKE, FIVE
OF THOSE PILLS A DAY,

12:09.567 --> 12:12.067
AND NOTHING'S DIFFERENT.

12:13.500 --> 12:14.733
BOOBS, DUDE.

12:14.767 --> 12:16.400
YOU...

12:16.433 --> 12:18.333
WERE TRYING TO MAKE
YOUR BREASTS GROW?

12:18.367 --> 12:21.233
I WANTED TO BE NORMAL
FOR ONCE IN MY LIFE.

12:21.267 --> 12:24.667
IS THIS WHAT CAUSED
THE TUMOR?
NO, NO.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.600
THE PILL WOULDN'T HAVE
ANY EFFECT ON YOUR LYMPH NODES,

12:26.633 --> 12:28.533
BUT THE AMOUNT
THAT YOU WERE TAKING

12:28.567 --> 12:29.600
IS REALLY DANGEROUS,

12:29.633 --> 12:33.433
AND IT CAUSED A PRETTY MAJOR
HORMONAL IMBALANCE.

12:33.467 --> 12:35.400
HAVE YOU BEEN FEELING
DIFFERENT THAN USUAL?

12:35.433 --> 12:39.100
I FEEL LIKE I ALWAYS FEEL.

12:40.633 --> 12:43.833
(bell dings)

12:43.867 --> 12:45.200
HI.

12:45.233 --> 12:46.800
HI.

12:46.833 --> 12:48.300
YOU'RE LEAVING?

12:48.333 --> 12:51.533
80-HOUR LIMIT. YOU?

12:51.567 --> 12:53.533
SURGERY WAS POSTPONED.

12:56.767 --> 12:59.700
I HAVE A DOG.
YOU HAVE A DOG.

12:59.733 --> 13:01.233
MY POINT IS,
I HAVE A DOG.

13:01.267 --> 13:02.667
YOU HAVE A DOG.

13:02.700 --> 13:04.533
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I LOVE DOGS.

13:04.567 --> 13:06.800
I'VE MOVED ON,
SO DON'T GIVE ME THAT LOOK.

13:06.833 --> 13:08.733
WHAT LOOK?

13:08.767 --> 13:12.133
THAT LOOK. OUR LOOK.
I'M OVER YOU.

13:12.167 --> 13:13.633
I'M OVER YOU, TOO.

13:13.667 --> 13:14.833
YOU ARE?

13:14.867 --> 13:16.800
NO.
OH.

13:16.833 --> 13:18.433
WELL, I AM.

13:18.467 --> 13:19.633
***

13:19.667 --> 13:21.333
OVER YOU.

13:21.367 --> 13:22.533
I'M OVER YOU, TOO.

13:22.567 --> 13:24.367
YOU JUST SAID...

13:24.400 --> 13:25.600
OH, SHUT UP.

13:25.633 --> 13:27.167
(bell dings)

13:27.200 --> 13:29.500
***

13:29.533 --> 13:31.833
HI.

13:31.867 --> 13:33.667
BYE.

13:33.700 --> 13:37.067
***

13:45.400 --> 13:47.433
THERE IS A LAND
CALLED PASSIVE AGGRESSIVA,

13:47.467 --> 13:49.133
AND YOU ARE THEIR QUEEN.

13:49.167 --> 13:51.100
I AM FINE.

13:51.133 --> 13:52.433
EXCEPT WHEN YOU'RE SHRIEKING
ABOUT TROUT.

13:52.467 --> 13:53.800
I WAS NOT SHRIEKING
ABOUT TROUT.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.800
RIGHT, YOU WEREN'T. YOU WERE
SHRIEKING ABOUT MEREDITH.

13:55.833 --> 13:58.067
NO, I WAS SHRIEKING ABOUT
THE TRAILER. I HATE THE TRAILER.

13:58.067 --> 14:00.567
OKAY, SO THE PAST THREE WEEKS
HAVE BEEN ABOUT THE TRAILER.
YES.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.467
NOT ABOUT THE FACT THAT
I SAID I LOVE MEREDITH.
LOVED.

14:02.500 --> 14:03.800
WHAT?
YOU SAID YOU LOVED HER,
PAST TENSE.

14:03.833 --> 14:05.833
RIGHT, YES. PAST TENSE.

14:05.867 --> 14:08.367
WELL, THEN I HAVE BEEN
SHRIEKING ABOUT THE TRAILER.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.333
(bell dings)

14:10.367 --> 14:11.633
(sighs)

14:13.567 --> 14:17.100
OKAY, MAUER, IT'S TIME TO RETURN
YOUR BOOK TO THE LIBRARY.

14:17.133 --> 14:18.600
SURGERY'S IN AN HOUR.

14:18.633 --> 14:20.533
WHAT'S UP
WITH THIS FLOP SWEAT?

14:20.567 --> 14:23.433
PROBABLY JUST NERVES.
BUT I'M SWEATING
LIKE--LIKE--LIKE NIXON,

14:23.467 --> 14:24.700
PRESIDENT
RICHARD MILHOUS NIXON.

14:24.733 --> 14:27.533
THAT GUY COULD SWEAT.
AND I, MAUER PASKOWITZ,

14:27.567 --> 14:29.367
I WROTE
AN EPICALLY CRAP NOVEL,

14:29.400 --> 14:31.433
BUT I SURE AS SHINOLA
CAN SWEAT LIKE NIXON.

14:31.467 --> 14:33.367
COME ON. IT'S NOT EVEN
THAT BAD OF A BOOK.

14:33.400 --> 14:35.167
I READ
PRACTICALLY EVERY DRAFT.

14:35.200 --> 14:37.067
FORGIVE ME, HONEY, BUT YOU
ARE NOT EXACTLY LIONEL TRILLING.

14:37.100 --> 14:38.700
IT BLOWS.
LIONEL TRILLING?

14:38.733 --> 14:40.333
HE SEEKS THE APPROVAL
OF DEAD LITERARY CRITICS.

14:40.367 --> 14:41.733
THE DEAD DON'T READ, MAUER.

14:41.767 --> 14:44.100
YOU EVER THINK ABOUT BEING
SOMETHING OTHER THAN A WRITER?

14:44.133 --> 14:46.067
NO. I AM A WRITER.
MAUER PASKOWITZ.

14:46.067 --> 14:47.600
I HAVE NO PLAN "B."

14:47.633 --> 14:49.500
WE CAN'T GET MARRIED
FOR THREE YEARS,

14:49.533 --> 14:50.467
TILL THE DAMN BOOK IS DONE.

14:50.500 --> 14:52.467
THREE YEARS, I LISTEN TO HIM
PISS AND MOAN.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.400
FOR WHAT,
SO HE CAN EAT THE THING?

14:54.433 --> 14:55.500
HA.

14:55.533 --> 14:57.433
YOUR COMPUTER
HAVE A "DELETE" BUTTON?

14:57.467 --> 14:59.333
I WANTED TO LITERALLY
PUT IT BEHIND ME

14:59.367 --> 15:01.067
AND START A NEW BOOK.

15:01.067 --> 15:02.733
OKAY. WE ALL GET
THE SYMBOLISM.

15:02.767 --> 15:04.067
IT'S PAINFULLY OBVIOUS.

15:04.100 --> 15:05.600
AND OBVIOUSLY PAINFUL.

15:05.633 --> 15:07.200
(chuckles)

15:13.467 --> 15:14.700
(whispers) HEY. UH, HI.

15:14.733 --> 15:16.633
(normal voice)
UM, I HEARD YOU'RE GOING

15:16.667 --> 15:18.167
TO TWIN FALLS, IDAHO.

15:18.200 --> 15:19.533
I'VE NEVER BEEN.

15:19.567 --> 15:21.067
YOU REACHED 80 HOURS?

15:21.100 --> 15:22.067
TECHNICALLY.

15:22.100 --> 15:24.767
YOU'RE OFF WORK, CRISTINA.
GO ENJOY YOUR DAY.

15:24.800 --> 15:27.633
I'LL ENJOY MY DAY IF I
CAN HELP RETRIEVE A HEART.

15:27.667 --> 15:29.200
I PROMISE.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.600
IT'S A NICE COAT.

15:32.633 --> 15:34.133
SEE THAT, DR. O'MALLEY?

15:34.167 --> 15:36.067
IT LOOKS LIKE THE TUMOR
IS COMPRESSING AN OVARY.

15:36.100 --> 15:39.367
YEAH, THAT'S WHY I BIOPSIED
BOTH OVARIES.

15:39.400 --> 15:42.133
IS THAT BAD?

15:42.167 --> 15:43.567
IT'S REALLY JUST
A PRECAUTION, BEX.

15:43.600 --> 15:45.533
WANT TO APPLY PRESSURE,
DR. O'MALLEY?
MM-HMM.

15:47.133 --> 15:49.167
I'M GONNA GET THIS
UP TO PATH.

15:49.200 --> 15:51.100
YOU MIND DOING THE DRESSINGS?
(George) SURE.

15:51.133 --> 15:54.100
ALL RIGHT, BEX,
WE'LL GET YOU THE RESULTS

15:54.133 --> 15:55.533
JUST AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

16:04.200 --> 16:05.567
YOU'RE A DOCTOR.

16:05.600 --> 16:08.067
HAVEN'T YOU SEEN SCARS BEFORE?

16:08.100 --> 16:10.800
I WAS JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHY SOMEONE WITH SO MUCH TALENT

16:10.833 --> 16:12.667
WOULD WANT TO DO THAT.

16:13.800 --> 16:15.533
IT'S JUST A COMIC BOOK.

16:16.733 --> 16:18.633
IT'S ABOUT ME
AND MY BEST FRIEND JENN

16:18.667 --> 16:20.567
WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

16:20.600 --> 16:21.533
SATISFIED?

16:21.567 --> 16:23.333
DOES SHE WRITE IT
WITH YOU?

16:23.367 --> 16:25.267
JENN HAS A BOYFRIEND,
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

16:25.300 --> 16:28.267
I GET TO BE A FREAK
ALL BY MYSELF.
OH, A FREAK?

16:28.300 --> 16:31.133
THAT'S NOT THE EASIEST THING
TO BE IN HIGH SCHOOL, IS IT?

16:31.167 --> 16:33.133
YOU SOUND LIKE MY SHRINK.

16:33.167 --> 16:35.733
HEY, I WASN'T ALWAYS
A DOCTOR.

16:35.767 --> 16:38.167
IN HIGH SCHOOL...

16:38.200 --> 16:41.500
I WAS SECRETARY
AND TREASURER

16:41.533 --> 16:44.833
OF... THE DUNGEONS
& DRAGONS CLUB.

16:44.867 --> 16:46.367
OH, MAN.

16:46.400 --> 16:48.567
YEAH. I WAS ALSO
A MATHLETE.

16:48.600 --> 16:51.200
AND I WON THE BLUE RIBBON
IN BIOLOGY CLUB.

16:51.233 --> 16:53.800
BEST FETAL PIG DISSECTION.

16:53.833 --> 16:55.833
AH, LET ME TELL YOU,
THAT HAD THE GIRLS

16:55.867 --> 16:58.067
KNOCKING DOWN MY DOOR.

16:59.700 --> 17:02.133
YOU JUST HAVE TO GET THROUGH
HIGH SCHOOL.

17:02.167 --> 17:03.500
'CAUSE HIGH SCHOOL SUCKS

17:03.533 --> 17:05.433
FOR ANYONE WHO'S
THE LEAST BIT DIFFERENT.

17:05.467 --> 17:06.800
BUT THEN THERE'S COLLEGE,

17:06.833 --> 17:09.333
AND THEN
OUT IN THE REAL WORLD,

17:09.367 --> 17:12.300
YOU'LL FIND WHERE YOU FIT IN.

17:12.333 --> 17:13.667
YOU THINK SO?

17:13.700 --> 17:16.067
YEAH, I KNOW SO.

17:25.700 --> 17:27.067
HI.

17:27.100 --> 17:28.800
DENNY. (chuckles)
I THOUGHT YOU WERE ASLEEP.

17:28.833 --> 17:31.433
NAH. I DON'T SLEEP
IN HOSPITALS.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.400
SCARED I'LL NEVER WAKE UP.

17:37.267 --> 17:39.167
CAN I ASK YOU
SOMETHING PERSONAL?

17:39.200 --> 17:40.467
IF I SAY NO?

17:40.500 --> 17:42.667
I'LL HOLD MY BREATH,

17:42.700 --> 17:45.233
WHICH WILL STOP MY HEART,
KILLING ME.

17:45.267 --> 17:47.667
AND YOU'RE RIGHT HERE,
YOU'LL BE CHARGED WITH MURDER.

17:47.700 --> 17:50.533
A LIFETIME IN PRISON BEING LOVED
BY A BIG OLD GIRL NAMED HILDE.

17:50.567 --> 17:53.300
SO MY CHOICES
ARE HOMICIDE CHARGES

17:53.333 --> 17:55.233
OR INAPPROPRIATE PERSONAL
QUESTIONS FROM A PATIENT?

17:55.267 --> 17:56.433
I KNOW, IT KINDA SUCKS.

17:56.467 --> 17:58.567
YOU KNOW WHAT?
HOLD YOUR BREATH.

17:58.600 --> 18:01.300
I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES WITH HILDE.
I CAN DO GIRL ON GIRL.

18:01.333 --> 18:03.233
OH, SEE, YOU'RE BRINGING UP
GIRL ON GIRL.

18:03.267 --> 18:06.133
HOW CAN I BLACKMAIL YOU
IF YOU BRING UP GIRL ON GIRL?

18:06.167 --> 18:08.300
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?

18:08.333 --> 18:10.233
THAT GUY ALEX,
YOU WITH HIM?

18:10.267 --> 18:13.400
NO, NOT ANYMORE,
AND NEVER, EVER AGAIN.

18:13.433 --> 18:14.800
GOOD.

18:14.833 --> 18:15.767
GOOD?

18:15.800 --> 18:17.533
YEAH, GOOD.

18:17.567 --> 18:19.533
IT MEANS I WON'T HAVE TO
FIGHT HIM FOR YOU.

18:19.567 --> 18:22.433
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I WANT YOU
TO FIGHT HIM FOR ME?

18:22.467 --> 18:24.433
HELLO.
YOU ARE IN LOVE WITH ME.

18:24.467 --> 18:26.133
AM I?

18:26.167 --> 18:27.333
YEAH. IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

18:27.367 --> 18:29.267
I MEAN, I'M WELL-OFF,
BUT I'M NOT INTO MONEY,

18:29.300 --> 18:31.200
I'M SMART,
BUT I'M NOT A KNOW-IT-ALL,

18:31.233 --> 18:33.533
I'M FUNNY,
I'M--I'M REALLY NICE,

18:33.567 --> 18:34.733
I LOVE ANIMALS,

18:34.767 --> 18:36.667
AND I'M HOT.

18:36.700 --> 18:38.367
I'M A CATCH,

18:38.400 --> 18:41.267
YOU KNOW, IF YOU CAN WRAP
YOUR HEAD AROUND

18:41.300 --> 18:45.167
THE ENLARGED, FAILING HEART
AND THE DEPENDENCY TO I.V. MEDS.

18:45.200 --> 18:49.267
(sighs) YOU'RE RIGHT.
I AM SO IN LOVE WITH YOU.

18:49.300 --> 18:50.800
IT'S A SHAME, REALLY,

18:50.833 --> 18:52.800
SINCE I'M WITH HILDE AND ALL.

18:52.833 --> 18:55.767
(laughs)

18:55.800 --> 18:57.567
THERE--

18:57.600 --> 19:00.400
FIVE LOADS OF LAUNDRY.

19:00.433 --> 19:05.300
I HAVE LITERALLY WASHED THE PAST
OUT OF MY LIFE.

19:09.433 --> 19:11.100
YOU PAGED ME?

19:11.133 --> 19:11.800
YEAH.

19:11.833 --> 19:13.333
HAVE A LOOK AT THIS.

19:13.367 --> 19:14.700
IT'S BEX' BIOPSY.

19:14.733 --> 19:16.233
BIOPSIED OVARY?

19:16.267 --> 19:17.833
NOT EXACTLY.

19:17.867 --> 19:20.567
ARRANGE A MEETING
WITH BEX' PARENTS, GEORGE.

19:20.600 --> 19:22.467
OH, AND FIND OUT WHO
THE ON CALL PSYCHIATRIST IS,

19:22.500 --> 19:24.367
IF THEY'RE AVAILABLE
TO JOIN US.
DOES SHE HAVE CANCER?

19:24.400 --> 19:27.233
NO. IT'S NOT AN OVARY,
IT'S A TESTIS.

19:27.267 --> 19:28.700
A TESTIS?

19:28.733 --> 19:30.267
ARE YOU SURE?

19:30.300 --> 19:33.567
YES, I'M SURE.

19:33.600 --> 19:36.200
BEX IS A HERMAPHRODITE?

19:36.233 --> 19:38.067
YES.

20:01.267 --> 20:02.267
YANG...

20:02.300 --> 20:05.467
WHY ARE YOU STARING
AT MY FAT, PREGNANT BELLY?

20:05.500 --> 20:07.433
SORRY. I...

20:09.267 --> 20:10.333
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

20:10.367 --> 20:13.067
YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT
OUR DAUGHTER--MY DAUGHTER--

20:13.100 --> 20:15.800
YOU'RE TELLING ME MY DAUGHTER
MIGHT ACTUALLY BE A BOY?

20:15.833 --> 20:18.067
THAT--
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

20:18.100 --> 20:20.433
I-I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THAT--

20:20.467 --> 20:22.633
SH-SHOULDN'T THIS HAVE BEEN
DETECTED SOMEHOW?

20:22.667 --> 20:25.200
EXTERNALLY, BEX HAS
FEMALE GENITALIA.

20:25.233 --> 20:26.533
SHE LOOKS LIKE A GIRL.

20:26.567 --> 20:31.100
BUT INTERNALLY, SHE HAS
BOTH FEMALE AND MALE SEX ORGANS.

20:31.133 --> 20:32.300
SO WHAT NOW?

20:32.333 --> 20:34.633
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO?

20:34.667 --> 20:36.167
I-I DON'T UNDERSTAND--

20:36.200 --> 20:37.567
(Addison)
OKAY, THE BEST NEWS

20:37.600 --> 20:39.467
IS THAT THE LYMPH NODE TUMOR
IS BENIGN.

20:39.500 --> 20:41.100
SO PHYSICALLY, BEX IS
GOING TO BE JUST FINE,

20:41.133 --> 20:42.800
BUT EMOTIONALLY,
PSYCHOLOGICALLY,

20:42.833 --> 20:44.833
I STRONGLY RECOMMEND
THERAPY.

20:44.867 --> 20:47.367
(Mr. Singleton)
SHE'S ALREADY IN THERAPY.

20:47.400 --> 20:49.067
I'M TALKING ABOUT THERAPY
FOR ALL OF YOU.

20:49.100 --> 20:50.833
THIS IS NOT GONNA BE EASY
FOR BEX TO HEAR,

20:50.867 --> 20:54.267
AND IT'S NOT GONNA BE AN EASY
ADJUSTMENT FOR YOU TO MAKE.

20:54.300 --> 20:56.367
OH, MY GOD.
A BIG ADJUSTMENT,
WHAT KIND OF ADJUSTMENT?

20:56.400 --> 20:58.067
MANY INTERSEXED PEOPLE

20:58.100 --> 21:00.700
BEGIN TO IDENTIFY VERY STRONGLY
WITH ONE SEX,

21:00.733 --> 21:04.067
AND IT'S NOT NECESSARILY
THE SEX THEY'VE BEEN RAISED.

21:04.067 --> 21:05.133
SHE'S A GIRL.

21:05.167 --> 21:07.600
SHE LOOKS LIKE A GIRL.
SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A GIRL.

21:07.633 --> 21:10.733
THIS AT LEAST HELPS EXPLAIN
WHY SHE FEELS SO DIFFERENT.

21:12.600 --> 21:15.333
THE POINT IS, BIOLOGICALLY
AND EMOTIONALLY SPEAKING,

21:15.367 --> 21:17.067
SHE HAS A CHOICE TO MAKE.

21:17.100 --> 21:19.167
A CHOICE?

21:20.867 --> 21:22.200
MY MOUTH FEELS ALL WEIRD.

21:22.233 --> 21:24.133
CHEWING PAPER WILL HAVE
THAT EFFECT, LOVER.

21:24.167 --> 21:26.600
WEIRD HOW?

21:26.633 --> 21:28.533
PINS AND NEEDLES.
NO, NEEDLES AND PINS.

21:28.567 --> 21:30.467
NEEDLES AND PINS--
YEAH, YEAH--

21:30.500 --> 21:32.300
SPROUTING FROM MY FINGERS
AND TOES

21:32.333 --> 21:33.533
LIKE--LIKE--LIKE...

21:33.567 --> 21:37.067
LORD, GOD, GIVE ME A SIMILE.

21:37.067 --> 21:38.400
IS HE ALWAYS THIS WAY?

21:38.433 --> 21:40.333
THE MAN ATE A NOVEL.
HE'S NOT EXACTLY NORMAL.

21:40.367 --> 21:42.267
BUT HE GOT WEIRDER,
THE MORE HE ATE.

21:42.300 --> 21:43.633
HE'S, LIKE, OBSESSED.

21:43.667 --> 21:45.167
MR. PASKOWITZ,
I'M DR. WEBBER.

21:45.200 --> 21:47.500
I'M GONNA BE PERFORMING
YOUR SURGERY TODAY.

21:47.533 --> 21:50.367
I POURED MY HEART AND SOUL
INTO THAT FREAKIN' BOOK,

21:50.400 --> 21:52.300
AND NOW IT'S STUCK UP MY ASS.

21:52.333 --> 21:54.233
PUT THAT ON MY TOMBSTONE,
AUDREY.

21:54.267 --> 21:56.533
ON MY TOMBSTONE!

22:03.833 --> 22:05.200
HEY, DR. STEVENS.

22:05.233 --> 22:07.100
HEY, DENNY. YOU OKAY?

22:07.133 --> 22:09.833
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
A LONG TIME, YOU KNOW?

22:09.867 --> 22:11.767
YOU OPEN UP MY CHEST,
TAKE OUT MY HEART,

22:11.800 --> 22:14.333
AND REPLACE IT
WITH ANOTHER ONE.

22:14.367 --> 22:15.700
WELL, NOT ME,

22:15.733 --> 22:17.567
AND NOT ANOTHER HEART,
A BETTER HEART.

22:17.600 --> 22:18.533
(sighs)

22:18.567 --> 22:21.200
WHAT IF SOMETHING
GOES WRONG?

22:23.333 --> 22:24.400
DON'T BE NERVOUS.

22:24.433 --> 22:26.333
DR. BURKE
IS AN INCREDIBLE SURGEON.

22:26.367 --> 22:28.267
AND YOU'RE GETTING
A NEW HEART TODAY.

22:28.300 --> 22:29.800
JUST KEEP THINKING
ABOUT THAT.

22:29.833 --> 22:32.100
OKAY, OKAY.

22:32.133 --> 22:33.167
DENNY.

22:33.200 --> 22:35.733
PRESTON BURKE--MY FAVORITE
CARDIOTHORACIC SURGEON.

22:35.767 --> 22:38.333
YOU'RE ONLY CARDIOTHORACIC
SURGEON, BUT THANKS.

22:38.367 --> 22:40.333
I'LL BE ON THE PHONE
WITH DR. BAILEY

22:40.367 --> 22:42.133
AS THE ORGAN RECOVERY
PROGRESSES.

22:42.167 --> 22:44.633
WE'LL MAKE SURE
THAT THE HEART STAYS VIABLE,

22:44.667 --> 22:47.500
ISN'T DAMAGED AS
THE OTHER ORGANS ARE PERFUSED.

22:47.533 --> 22:50.400
WE'LL HAVE YOU IN THE O.R.,
AND IF IT IS A GO,

22:50.433 --> 22:53.267
WE START THE PROCEDURE BEFORE
SHE EVEN GETS BACK.

22:53.300 --> 22:55.200
HEY, IZZIE.
YEAH.

22:55.233 --> 22:58.400
I'M GETTIN' A NEW HEART.

22:58.433 --> 23:00.800
YOU'RE GETTING A NEW HEART.

23:04.300 --> 23:05.633
I'LL SEE YOU.

23:05.667 --> 23:07.367
BYE.

23:09.500 --> 23:11.500
(Mr. Singleton)
UM, EXCUSE ME.

23:11.533 --> 23:15.233
UM, MARY AND I WERE TALKING,

23:15.267 --> 23:17.167
AND, UH, WE THINK
BEX SHOULD STAY--

23:17.200 --> 23:19.067
SHE CAN'T HANDLE
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

23:19.100 --> 23:20.533
YOU SAW THE SCARS.

23:20.567 --> 23:22.067
WAIT, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA TELL HER?

23:22.067 --> 23:23.733
BUT THIS COULD HELP HER.

23:23.767 --> 23:26.533
YOU CAN'T NOT TELL HER
WHO SHE IS.
DR. O'MALLEY.

23:26.567 --> 23:28.300
UH, WE'LL GO AHEAD AND PROCEED

23:28.333 --> 23:30.533
WITH THE SCHEDULED SURGERY
TO REMOVE THE TUMOR,

23:30.567 --> 23:33.433
AND THEN YOU CAN TALK TO
YOUR DAUGHTER IN YOUR OWN TIME.

23:33.467 --> 23:35.100
ACTUALLY, WE'RE THINKING...

23:35.133 --> 23:37.600
WE THOUGHT, SINCE YOU'RE
ALREADY GONNA BE IN THERE, UH...

23:37.633 --> 23:39.533
WE KNOW "FIXED"
ISN'T THE RIGHT WORD, BUT--

23:39.567 --> 23:41.767
WE WERE THINKING THAT WITH
THE HORMONAL CONFUSION,

23:41.800 --> 23:44.600
IT MIGHT BE EASIER ON HER

23:44.633 --> 23:46.467
TO REMOVE WHATEVER
BOY PARTS SHE HAS.

23:46.500 --> 23:48.700
KEEP HER MORE OF A GIRL.

23:48.733 --> 23:50.633
JUST TO BE CLEAR,
YOU'RE ASKING ME TO PERFORM

23:50.667 --> 23:52.500
SEXUAL REASSIGNMENT SURGERY
ON YOUR DAUGHTER?
(both) YES.

23:52.533 --> 23:53.833
WITHOUT HER KNOWING?

23:53.867 --> 23:55.733
(Mr. Singleton)
ALL SHE'S SAID ALL HER LIFE

23:55.767 --> 23:57.400
IS THAT SHE WANTS
TO BE NORMAL.

23:57.433 --> 23:59.667
SHE DOESN'T FEEL NORMAL.

23:59.700 --> 24:01.600
WHY CAN'T WE JUST PUT AN END
TO HER AGONY?

24:01.633 --> 24:02.800
WELL, FIRST OF ALL, REMOVING
HER MALE SEXUAL ORGANS

24:02.833 --> 24:05.833
MAY NOT DO THAT. IN FACT,
IT COULD DO JUST THE OPPOSITE.

24:05.867 --> 24:08.333
(Mrs. Singleton)
BUT HER HORMONES--
CAN BE CONTROLLED
WITH AN ORAL MEDICATION.

24:08.367 --> 24:10.300
WE JUST WANT THE BEST
FOR BEX.

24:10.333 --> 24:13.133
TO DO SURGERY AND ALTER
HER BODY PERMANENTLY IS--

24:13.167 --> 24:14.633
WELL, I JUST WOULD NEVER
DO THAT ON SOMEONE

24:14.667 --> 24:16.567
WHO'S UNAWARE OF THE PROCEDURE,

24:16.600 --> 24:20.267
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE HARD PRESSED
TO FIND A SURGEON WHO WILL.

24:20.300 --> 24:21.733
***

24:21.767 --> 24:25.567
BEX WILL LEARN THE TRUTH...
SOMEDAY.

24:25.600 --> 24:28.067
H-HOW DO YOU WANT HER
TO FIND OUT?

24:29.400 --> 24:30.767
EXCUSE ME.

24:30.800 --> 24:34.500
***

24:37.133 --> 24:38.467
MEREDITH, HI.

24:38.500 --> 24:39.667
HI. I HAD THE MORNING OFF,

24:39.700 --> 24:42.233
SO I THOUGHT I WOULD COME
AND SEE HOW MY MOTHER'S DOING.

24:42.267 --> 24:44.167
OH, SHE'S FINE.
SHE'S IN THE SITTING ROOM.

24:44.200 --> 24:45.300
THANKS.

24:45.333 --> 24:48.133
SHE'S IN GOOD SPIRITS.
VISITORS REALLY CHEER HER UP.

24:48.167 --> 24:50.233
(quietly) VISITORS?

24:51.833 --> 24:55.567
***

25:01.733 --> 25:03.467
(Meredith)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

25:03.500 --> 25:05.367
THERE IS A CLINICAL TRIAL
TO STUDY THE PROGRESSION

25:05.400 --> 25:07.567
OF EARLY-ONSET ALZHEIMER'S.

25:07.600 --> 25:11.133
OKAY, ME, YOU CAN SCREW WITH.
MY MOTHER? NO, NOT ACCEPTABLE.

25:11.167 --> 25:13.067
LOOK, THERE'S BEEN
SOME REALLY PROMISING RESULTS

25:13.100 --> 25:14.767
FROM SIMILAR STUDIES
IN EUROPE.

25:14.800 --> 25:16.300
YOUR MOTHER
IS A PRIME CANDIDATE.

25:16.333 --> 25:18.233
MY MOTHER IS VERY SICK
AND HAS VERY FEW GOOD DAYS.

25:18.267 --> 25:20.067
AND I DON'T WANT HER BEING
POKED AND PRODDED

25:20.067 --> 25:22.067
FOR SOME EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM.
I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP.

25:22.100 --> 25:23.833
WELL, SEE, THIS,
WHAT YOU'RE DOING, BEING DREAMY,

25:23.867 --> 25:25.233
IT DOESN'T HELP.

25:25.267 --> 25:26.500
IT HURTS ME.

25:26.533 --> 25:28.233
IT MESSES WITH MY HEAD.

25:28.267 --> 25:30.100
I KNOW THE FEELING.
I DON'T DOUBT THAT.

25:30.133 --> 25:32.167
BUT YOU HAVE A WIFE
TO GO HOME TO.

25:32.200 --> 25:33.667
AND I'M GUESSING

25:33.700 --> 25:36.067
SHE HAS NO IDEA
WHERE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW.

25:36.067 --> 25:37.533
YEAH. NO, SHE DOESN'T.

25:37.567 --> 25:39.600
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

25:48.333 --> 25:50.100
THANKS. DR. BURKE.

25:50.133 --> 25:52.267
Talk to me, Bailey.
What are we looking at?

25:52.300 --> 25:55.433
THE, UH, THE DONOR IS ON
25 MICS OF DOPAMINE.

25:55.467 --> 25:56.800
25 MICS? THAT'S TOO MUCH.

25:56.833 --> 25:59.267
THEY'VE STARTED HIM ON
5 MICS OF DOBUTAMINE

25:59.300 --> 26:01.067
30 MINUTES
PRIOR TO ARRIVAL.

26:01.100 --> 26:02.633
ARE THEY TRYING TO KILL
MY HEART?

26:02.667 --> 26:04.567
WHAT IS HIS CENTRAL VENOUS
PRESSURE NOW?
C.V.P., DOCTOR?

26:04.600 --> 26:06.100
BACK AROUND 10.
AROUND 10.

26:06.133 --> 26:07.467
MAP CLOSE TO 80.

26:07.500 --> 26:09.367
And his mean arterial pressure?
CLOSE TO 80.

26:09.400 --> 26:12.267
I CAN LIVE WITH A C.V.P.
AS LOW AS 5, A MAP ABOUT 60.

26:12.300 --> 26:14.167
THAT HEART NEEDS TO BE
OFF DOBUTAMINE.

26:14.200 --> 26:16.500
THE HEART NEEDS TO BE
OFF DOBUTAMINE.

26:16.533 --> 26:18.067
AND TELL THEM TO GET

26:18.067 --> 26:19.800
THE DOPAMINE
BACK DOWN TO 10 MICS

26:19.833 --> 26:23.133
AND GET THEM TO GET
ANOTHER 2 UNITS OF BLOOD.

26:23.167 --> 26:24.633
WE A GO, DOC?

26:24.667 --> 26:26.167
STILL NO FINAL WORD.

26:26.200 --> 26:29.067
I WANT YOU TO HAVE
THE HEALTHIEST HEART I CAN FIND.

26:29.100 --> 26:32.067
DR. STEVENS, YOU'LL BE
IN THERE WITH US, RIGHT?

26:33.667 --> 26:35.600
YEAH, I'LL BE IN THERE
WITH YOU.

26:37.333 --> 26:39.233
(Richard) ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE.
WE'RE GOING TO BE REMOVING

26:39.267 --> 26:41.167
A CLUMP OF FOREIGN MATTER LODGED
IN THE ILEOCECAL JUNCTION

26:41.200 --> 26:42.700
OF WORLD-RENOWNED NOVELIST
MAUER PASKOWITZ...

26:42.733 --> 26:44.633
HEY, AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO BE HAVING FREE TIME?

26:44.667 --> 26:46.533
OH, I DID FIVE LOADS
OF LAUNDRY,

26:46.567 --> 26:48.467
CUT MY SPLIT ENDS, STUDIED,
CLEANED OUT THE FRIDGE.

26:48.500 --> 26:50.200
FREE TIME SUCKS.

26:50.233 --> 26:52.133
WHEN WOULD HAVE BEEN
THE RIGHT TIME

26:52.167 --> 26:55.067
TO HEAR ABOUT
YOUR BOYFRIEND'S WIFE?

26:55.067 --> 26:57.300
OKAY, ARE YOU MAD AT ME
OR SOMETHING?

26:57.333 --> 27:00.133
NO. NO. SORRY. IT'S JUST,
I HAVE THIS PATIENT,

27:00.167 --> 27:02.300
AND I GET THAT THERE'S
A RIGHT AND A WRONG TIME

27:02.333 --> 27:03.833
TO HEAR BIG NEWS,

27:03.867 --> 27:05.800
BUT WOULDN'T YOU RATHER KNOW
SOONER THAN LATER?

27:05.833 --> 27:08.700
I MEAN, SO YOU CAN MOVE FORWARD
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

27:08.733 --> 27:10.633
I MEAN,
IT'S A FRESH START, RIGHT?

27:10.667 --> 27:12.100
(Richard) OKAY, OKAY.

27:12.133 --> 27:14.067
SEE THE WHITE LINE OF TOLDT?

27:14.067 --> 27:15.400
NOW WE CAN MOBILIZE

27:15.433 --> 27:17.333
THE LATERAL BORDER
OF THE LEFT COLON.

27:17.367 --> 27:18.133
CLAMP.

27:18.167 --> 27:20.200
WHEN LEO TOLSTOY HERE
WAKES UP,

27:20.233 --> 27:23.133
YOU MIGHT GET HIM TO REVISIT
THE IDEA OF A NEW VOCATION.

27:23.167 --> 27:24.333
HE'S PRETTY AGAINST THE IDEA.

27:24.367 --> 27:26.067
YEAH, WELL, HOPEFULLY,
IT WAS JUST DELIRIUM.

27:26.100 --> 27:27.300
IF IT'S ALL RIGHT,

27:27.333 --> 27:29.233
I'D LIKE TO KEEP
AN EXTRA EYE ON HIM POST-OP.

27:29.267 --> 27:30.600
HE'S ACTING PRETTY STRANGE.

27:30.633 --> 27:32.500
HE ATE A NOVEL.
CLEARLY, HE'S PRETTY STRANGE.

27:32.533 --> 27:34.067
YEAH, YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST,

27:34.100 --> 27:36.633
I DON'T WANT
TO OVERLOOK ANYTHING.
SERIOUSLY, KAREV,

27:36.667 --> 27:38.800
I'M SHORT-HANDED
ALL OVER THE HOSPITAL.

27:38.833 --> 27:40.733
OKAY, HERE WE GO.

27:44.467 --> 27:47.800
ANYBODY HERE
TEMPTED TO READ THIS?

27:47.833 --> 27:50.233
NO TAKERS?

27:50.267 --> 27:51.733
COULD BE
THE GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL.

27:51.767 --> 27:53.267
WE'LL NEVER KNOW.

27:53.300 --> 27:54.633
HE NEEDS A PLAN "B."

27:54.667 --> 27:56.567
HE MAY NOT BE
THE ONLY ONE.

27:56.600 --> 27:58.500
YOU DON'T THINK YOU PASSED?

27:58.533 --> 28:01.300
I THOUGHT I PASSED
THE FIRST TIME.

28:01.333 --> 28:02.767
WELL, LET'S WAIT AND SEE.

28:02.800 --> 28:06.700
RIGHT NOW, TODAY,
YOU'RE STILL HERE.

28:09.367 --> 28:11.500
DID YOU TELL MY PARENTS
ABOUT THE PILL?

28:11.533 --> 28:13.433
NO.

28:13.467 --> 28:15.433
AM I GONNA DIE?

28:15.467 --> 28:18.333
IS THAT WHAT NO ONE
WANTS TO TELL ME?
OF COURSE NOT.

28:18.367 --> 28:20.467
THEN WHY ARE MY PARENTS
ACTING SO...

28:20.500 --> 28:23.400
WILL YOU JUST TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?

28:23.433 --> 28:25.333
WHAT'S GOING ON IS, UH,
WE'RE PREPPING YOU FOR SURGERY

28:25.367 --> 28:29.133
TO REMOVE THE LYMPH NODE TUMOR
THAT'S COMPRESSING YOUR...

28:29.167 --> 28:30.600
OVARY.

28:34.167 --> 28:37.100
HEY, BEX.
HOW YOU DOIN'?

28:37.133 --> 28:39.067
MOM, DAD, THIS IS
REALLY FREAKING ME OUT.

28:39.067 --> 28:41.100
OH, NO, EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE FINE, BEX.

28:41.133 --> 28:42.467
IT'S OKAY, SWEETIE.

28:42.500 --> 28:44.400
I'M HAVING SURGERY
TO REMOVE A TUMOR

28:44.433 --> 28:46.100
THAT'S COMPRESSING MY OVARY,

28:46.133 --> 28:50.433
RIGHT, GEORGE?

28:50.467 --> 28:51.733
DR. O'MALLEY.

28:53.700 --> 28:55.200
GEORGE?

28:57.333 --> 28:59.200
WHAT, AM I JUST SUPPOSED
TO LIE TO HER?

28:59.233 --> 29:00.767
OKAY.

29:00.800 --> 29:02.100
THAT'S ENOUGH.

29:02.133 --> 29:03.300
DR. O'MALLEY,
PLEASE LEAVE THE ROOM.

29:03.333 --> 29:05.200
NO, WAIT.

29:05.233 --> 29:07.133
TELL ME
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME.

29:07.167 --> 29:09.500
WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?

29:12.800 --> 29:16.567
BEX... WE LEARNED

29:16.600 --> 29:20.400
THAT YOUR TUMOR,
IT'S NOT COMPRESSING AN OVARY.

29:20.433 --> 29:22.700
THEN WHERE IS IT?

29:22.733 --> 29:26.733
IT'S ON A TESTES.

29:26.767 --> 29:29.067
LIKE A TESTICLE?

29:30.633 --> 29:32.133
I HAVE TESTICLES?

29:32.167 --> 29:34.333
(Addison) YES, ONE.

29:34.367 --> 29:36.800
BEX, THIS IS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT
OF INFORMATION FOR YOU--

29:36.833 --> 29:39.200
AND I'VE HAD IT
MY WHOLE LIFE.

29:41.300 --> 29:43.333
OH, MY GOD.

29:43.367 --> 29:45.700
DOES THIS MEAN...

29:45.733 --> 29:49.667
DOES THIS MEAN
I COULD BE A BOY?

30:01.567 --> 30:03.100
YOU ENGINEERED
THAT CONVERSATION.

30:03.133 --> 30:04.700
YOU FORCED OUR HAND.
WELL, YOU WERE LYING
TO HER.

30:04.733 --> 30:06.767
WE WERE PROTECTING HER.
SHE'S A 14-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

30:06.800 --> 30:09.367
MAYBE. MAYBE NOT.

30:09.400 --> 30:11.167
THIS ISN'T YOUR LIFE.

30:11.200 --> 30:12.600
THIS ISN'T YOUR CHILD.

30:12.633 --> 30:16.200
14 YEARS--14 YEARS,
WE HAVE RAISED A DAUGHTER,

30:16.233 --> 30:18.767
AND IN ONE AFTERNOON,
YOU EXPECT US TO--WHAT?

30:18.800 --> 30:20.833
WHAT IS BEX SUPPOSED TO DO?

30:20.867 --> 30:22.800
HOW IS SHE SUPPOSED TO GO HOME
AND TELL THE OTHER KIDS--WHAT?

30:22.833 --> 30:24.833
YOU HAD NO RIGHT.

30:24.867 --> 30:27.467
NO, I KNOW.
I'M OFF THE CASE, RIGHT?

30:29.400 --> 30:31.267
OHH.

30:31.300 --> 30:34.833
MAUER, LAY BACK.

30:34.867 --> 30:36.667
YOU JUST HAD SURGERY.

30:36.700 --> 30:38.200
YOU'RE LOSING
YOUR SHIRT, MAN.

30:38.233 --> 30:39.733
MUCH OBLIGED, BROCK--
BROCK--

30:39.767 --> 30:41.167
MUCH OBLIGED, PAL.

30:41.200 --> 30:42.367
HOW ARE YOU FEELING,
MAUER?

30:42.400 --> 30:44.300
MUCH OBLIGED.

30:44.333 --> 30:46.233
WHAT'S WHACKED
FOR $20, ALEX?

30:46.267 --> 30:47.767
WEEDS WHACKED. WEEDS.

30:47.800 --> 30:49.133
WEEDS WHACKED FOR $200.

30:49.167 --> 30:51.800
W-WAY--WAY WHACKED.
WH--

30:51.833 --> 30:53.467
I SAW ELLIS.
AND?

30:53.500 --> 30:55.400
I THINK I CAN GET HER
INTO THE CLINICAL TRIAL.

30:55.433 --> 30:56.600
SHE'S A PERFECT CANDIDATE.

30:56.633 --> 30:58.533
EXCELLENT.
THANK YOU, DEREK.

30:58.567 --> 31:01.333
YOU REALIZE THIS REQUIRES
MEREDITH'S POWER OF ATTORNEY.

31:01.367 --> 31:02.267
YEAH.

31:02.300 --> 31:04.367
IT MIGHT BE BETTER
IF IT'S COMING FROM YOU.

31:04.400 --> 31:06.067
WITH ME, THERE'S BAGGAGE.

31:06.067 --> 31:08.200
YOU, YOU'RE JUST TRYING
TO HELP OUT A FRIEND.

31:08.233 --> 31:10.367
RIGHT. RIGHT.

31:10.400 --> 31:11.567
ALL RIGHT.

31:11.600 --> 31:16.067
WELL, LET ME KNOW IF MEREDITH
WANTS ME TO MAKE THE CALL.

31:17.500 --> 31:20.100
KAREV...
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

31:20.133 --> 31:21.633
RESEARCH
ON THE BEZOAR PATIENT.

31:21.667 --> 31:23.567
I TOLD YOU I NEEDED YOU
ON THE FLOOR.

31:23.600 --> 31:25.233
HE HAS FEVER, SWEATS,

31:25.267 --> 31:27.167
TINGLING IN HIS LIPS,
FINGERS AND TOES,

31:27.200 --> 31:29.100
MOOD SWINGS
AND LACK OF COORDINATION.

31:29.133 --> 31:31.067
AND DID I MENTION
THE CRAZY TALK?

31:31.067 --> 31:32.233
YOUR POINT?

31:32.267 --> 31:34.167
WELL, MY POINT IS,
HE ATE HIS NOVEL.

31:34.200 --> 31:35.700
I KNOW.

31:35.733 --> 31:38.667
MERCURY'S IN THE PAPER.
HE'S GOT MERCURY POISONING.

31:38.700 --> 31:41.700
CRISTINA, CALL BURKE.

31:41.733 --> 31:44.067
I'M FEELING
SOME FAIRLY EXTENSIVE DAMAGE

31:44.100 --> 31:45.800
FROM CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.

31:45.833 --> 31:47.333
UM...

31:47.367 --> 31:49.533
YANG.

31:52.333 --> 31:54.167
(cell phone rings)

31:54.200 --> 31:55.700
TALK TO ME, BAILEY.

31:55.733 --> 31:56.767
(Cristina) It's me.

31:56.800 --> 31:59.367
I CAN'T TALK. I'M WAITING
ON A CALL FROM BAILEY.

31:59.400 --> 32:01.700
I'M WITH BAILEY.

32:01.733 --> 32:03.733
YOU'RE IN IDAHO?

32:03.767 --> 32:05.533
YEAH.

32:05.567 --> 32:07.567
You're breaking the rules.

32:07.600 --> 32:09.467
YES.

32:09.500 --> 32:11.733
PRESTON, WHAT'S HAPPENING
WITH OUR HEART?

32:11.767 --> 32:13.267
HELLO, DR. WEBBER.

32:13.300 --> 32:15.600
TELL ME WHAT I NEED TO KNOW
ABOUT DENNY'S HEART,

32:15.633 --> 32:17.100
DR. BAILEY.

32:19.767 --> 32:22.667
(monitor beeping)

32:37.633 --> 32:39.400
THANK YOU.

32:39.433 --> 32:43.133
THIS PROGRAM DEREK LOOKED INTO
WAS A FAVOR TO ME.

32:43.167 --> 32:44.633
NICE TRY.

32:44.667 --> 32:47.633
SOMETIMES, MEREDITH,
A FAVOR IS JUST A FAVOR.

32:47.667 --> 32:49.567
THIS TREATMENT
WON'T CURE YOUR MOTHER,

32:49.600 --> 32:51.500
IT WON'T GIVE HER
A NEW LEASE ON LIFE,

32:51.533 --> 32:54.400
BUT IT MAY GIVE HER
MORE GOOD DAYS.

32:54.433 --> 32:56.800
I URGE YOU TO CONSIDER IT.

33:00.600 --> 33:02.500
LYING HERE TRAPPED
IN THIS FLESH PRISON,

33:02.533 --> 33:04.500
I HAVE REACHED
A GRIM CONCLUSION.

33:04.533 --> 33:07.367
I AM A FAILURE.

33:07.400 --> 33:09.333
YOU KNOW HOW THAT FEELS?

33:09.367 --> 33:11.067
DUDE, IF YOU ONLY KNEW.

33:11.067 --> 33:12.233
EVEN MY MANIC ATTEMPT

33:12.267 --> 33:15.400
TO PUT MY FAILED NOVEL
BEHIND ME FAILED.

33:15.433 --> 33:17.567
TIME FOR A PLAN "B,"
I RECKON.

33:17.600 --> 33:20.200
TIME, INDEED.

33:20.233 --> 33:22.467
PERHAPS I SHALL PLAY
THE CELLO.

33:22.500 --> 33:25.367
WELL, WE MAKE A MISTAKE HERE
AND PEOPLE DIE.

33:25.400 --> 33:27.733
IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

33:27.767 --> 33:29.833
ALL THE TIME?

33:29.867 --> 33:32.133
WELL, IT HAPPENS A LOT.

33:32.167 --> 33:34.533
THIS IS PART OF
THE HALLUCINATION, RIGHT?

33:34.567 --> 33:36.467
MY POINT IS, WE ALL
HAVE SETBACKS, MAUER.

33:36.500 --> 33:38.367
BUT I'M A DOCTOR,
AND YOU'RE A WRITER.

33:38.400 --> 33:41.267
WE DON'T HAVE A PLAN "B."

33:41.300 --> 33:42.633
CALL SECURITY.

33:42.667 --> 33:45.367
HAVE YOU DETERMINED A COURSE
OF TREATMENT

33:45.400 --> 33:47.267
FOR THE MERCURY POISONING,
DR. KAREV?

33:47.300 --> 33:49.200
YEAH, THE PATIENT
HAS BEEN ADMINISTERED

33:49.233 --> 33:51.133
A CHELATOR CALLED
BRITISH ANTI-LEUKOCYTE,

33:51.167 --> 33:54.533
WHICH WILL ABSORB THE MERCURY
OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS.

33:54.567 --> 33:56.667
GOOD WORK, DOCTOR.

34:12.767 --> 34:14.167
YANG...

34:22.467 --> 34:25.067
YOU KNOW WHAT'S WRONG
WITH HAVING AN 80-HOUR LIMIT?

34:25.067 --> 34:27.600
IT PROTECTS THE WEAK.
IT LEVELS THE PLAYING FIELD,

34:27.633 --> 34:30.467
WHICH NOT ONLY SUCKS,
IT'S DANGEROUS.

34:30.500 --> 34:33.600
80-HOUR WORK WEEK,
THAT'S WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?

34:39.633 --> 34:42.233
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT...

34:42.267 --> 34:43.800
NOT KEEPING IT.

34:43.833 --> 34:46.333
YOU DID?

34:46.367 --> 34:49.800
MY HUSBAND AND I,
WE TRIED FOR YEARS,

34:49.833 --> 34:53.300
BUT STILL, WHEN THAT STICK
TURNED BLUE...

34:53.333 --> 34:55.233
WELL, YOU CAN'T WORK
THE WAY WE WORK,

34:55.267 --> 34:58.133
YOU CAN'T WANT THE KIND
OF CAREERS THAT WE WANT,

34:58.167 --> 35:00.833
AND NOT TAKE... PAUSE.

35:00.867 --> 35:02.367
I TOOK PAUSE.

35:02.400 --> 35:03.733
YOU PAUSED?

35:03.767 --> 35:07.533
I PAUSED. I PAUSED
A VERY LONG TIME.

35:11.767 --> 35:13.667
SO WHY DID...

35:15.767 --> 35:20.133
I SAT UP ONE NIGHT,
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT...

35:21.800 --> 35:27.067
AND I KNEW
I COULD DO THIS.

35:27.067 --> 35:29.767
NOW I STILL DON'T KNOW
HOW I'M GONNA DO THIS,

35:29.800 --> 35:33.100
BUT I KNEW I COULD DO IT.

35:35.633 --> 35:38.367
YOU JUST HAVE TO KNOW,

35:38.400 --> 35:40.067
AND WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW,

35:40.100 --> 35:42.500
THEN NO ONE CAN FAULT YOU
FOR IT.

35:42.533 --> 35:44.733
YOU DO WHAT YOU CAN

35:44.767 --> 35:46.267
WHEN YOU CAN,

35:46.300 --> 35:49.333
WHY YOU CAN.

35:49.367 --> 35:53.067
AND WHEN YOU CAN'T,
YOU CAN'T.

35:58.567 --> 36:00.433
YOU'RE STALKING ME.

36:00.467 --> 36:01.700
YOU'RE A STALKER.

36:01.733 --> 36:05.067
WELL, CAN YOU BLAME ME?

36:05.100 --> 36:09.200
SO IT'S BAD, HUH?

36:10.400 --> 36:12.500
YOU HAVE TIME.

36:12.533 --> 36:13.700
LIAR.

36:13.733 --> 36:15.500
FINE, THERE'S NO TIME.

36:15.533 --> 36:18.433
OH, NOW THAT'S
JUST SPITEFUL.

36:19.867 --> 36:23.200
I DIDN'T GET THE HEART.

36:23.233 --> 36:26.467
YOU DIDN'T GET THE HEART.

36:38.733 --> 36:39.700
Hey

36:39.733 --> 36:42.200
HEY, GEORGE.

36:42.233 --> 36:44.467
HEY, I JUST, UH...

36:44.500 --> 36:46.433
I JUST WANTED TO CHECK IN
ON YOU.

36:46.467 --> 36:49.467
I HEARD MY PARENTS WEREN'T
TOO HAPPY WITH YOU.

36:49.500 --> 36:51.300
NOPE.

36:53.200 --> 36:54.667
THANKS FOR TELLING ME,

36:54.700 --> 36:57.300
FOR MAKING THEM TELL ME.

36:58.867 --> 37:03.067
YOU KNOW, UM, THERE ARE PEOPLE
THAT YOU CAN TALK TO.

37:03.067 --> 37:04.567
I CAN--IF YOU'D LIKE--

37:04.600 --> 37:06.200
I KNOW.

37:09.200 --> 37:11.500
GEORGE, DO I HAVE TO BE
A BOY NOW?

37:11.533 --> 37:13.433
NO.

37:13.467 --> 37:15.500
NO.

37:15.533 --> 37:17.433
BUT I CAN IF I WANT TO.

37:17.467 --> 37:19.800
YEAH, YOU CAN,

37:19.833 --> 37:21.333
IF YOU WANT.

37:21.367 --> 37:23.200
I...

37:23.233 --> 37:24.400
COULD YOU...

37:24.433 --> 37:26.833
WOULD YOU BRING ME
SOME SCISSORS?

37:26.867 --> 37:28.533
***

37:28.567 --> 37:29.700
WHO GETS TO DETERMINE

37:29.733 --> 37:32.700
WHEN THE OLD ENDS
AND THE NEW BEGINS?

37:35.267 --> 37:36.533
DEREK.

37:36.567 --> 37:37.767
HI.

37:37.800 --> 37:39.300
TELL ME ABOUT THE PROGRAM.

37:39.333 --> 37:41.500
IT'S NOT A DAY ON A CALENDAR,

37:41.533 --> 37:43.533
NOT A BIRTHDAY,
NOT A NEW YEAR.

37:43.567 --> 37:46.067
HEY, DENNY.
WE'LL SEE YA.

37:46.100 --> 37:47.600
OKAY.

37:47.633 --> 37:51.267
***

37:51.300 --> 37:53.400
HEY, HE'S LEAVING?

37:53.433 --> 37:54.767
DIDN'T GET THE HEART.

37:54.800 --> 37:56.300
I'M SORRY.

37:56.333 --> 37:57.267
YEAH.

37:57.300 --> 37:58.633
HE'S A GOOD GUY.

37:58.667 --> 38:01.433
YEAH, HE IS.

38:01.467 --> 38:04.333
***

38:06.100 --> 38:08.300
IT'S AN EVENT,

38:08.333 --> 38:11.167
BIG OR SMALL,

38:11.200 --> 38:13.200
SOMETHING THAT CHANGES US.

38:13.233 --> 38:17.067
IDEALLY, IT GIVES US HOPE...

38:17.067 --> 38:19.767
***

38:40.733 --> 38:45.233
A NEW WAY OF LIVING
AND LOOKING AT THE WORLD.

38:45.267 --> 38:48.167
***

38:50.400 --> 38:52.467
I'M COOKIN' THE TROUT
OUTSIDE.

38:52.500 --> 38:54.467
THANK YOU.

38:57.367 --> 39:00.200
OHH.

39:02.633 --> 39:08.667
THERE IS A LAND
CALLED PASSIVE AGGRESSIVA...

39:08.700 --> 39:10.200
AND I AM THEIR QUEEN.

39:10.233 --> 39:11.600
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

39:14.333 --> 39:15.800
SO WHAT...

39:15.833 --> 39:19.133
WITH MEREDITH...

39:19.167 --> 39:21.067
AM I SUPPOSED
TO JUST WAIT IT OUT,

39:21.100 --> 39:24.467
WAIT UNTIL IT PASSES?

39:25.700 --> 39:27.100
THAT'D BE GOOD.

39:27.133 --> 39:30.500
I STILL HATE THE TRAILER.

39:30.533 --> 39:34.400
AS IS YOUR RIGHT.

39:34.433 --> 39:37.133
***

39:37.167 --> 39:40.067
LETTING GO OF OLD HABITS,

39:40.067 --> 39:42.233
OLD MEMORIES...

39:44.867 --> 39:47.567
I WASN'T GONNA HAVE IT,
THE BABY.

39:47.600 --> 39:50.067
AND YOU DON'T GET TO BE
MAD ABOUT THAT.

39:50.100 --> 39:52.400
WE BARELY KNEW EACH OTHER,
I WAS AN INTERN,

39:52.433 --> 39:54.733
AND THERE WAS NO WAY
THAT I COULD HAVE EVEN--

39:54.767 --> 39:56.300
I'M NOT MAD.

39:58.067 --> 39:59.400
YOU'RE NOT?

39:59.433 --> 40:03.700
NO. I JUST WANTED TO KNOW.

40:05.433 --> 40:07.333
I WANT TO KNOW THINGS.

40:07.367 --> 40:10.767
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT
WE NEVER STOP BELIEVING

40:10.800 --> 40:12.833
WE CAN HAVE A NEW BEGINNING.

40:12.867 --> 40:15.567
(Doc barking)

40:15.600 --> 40:17.500
(Meredith) DOC,
THAT WAS MY LAUNDRY.

40:17.533 --> 40:21.167
YOU DON'T EAT LAUNDRY.
BAD DOG. BAD DOG.

40:21.200 --> 40:23.800
(barking continues)

40:26.500 --> 40:29.067
BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT
TO REMEMBER

40:29.100 --> 40:31.733
THAT AMID ALL THE CRAP...

40:31.767 --> 40:35.733
ARE A FEW THINGS
REALLY WORTH HOLDING ON TO.

40:35.767 --> 40:37.267
(barking continues)

40:37.300 --> 40:40.200
