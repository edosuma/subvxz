WEBVTT

00:00.530 --> 00:02.120
Previously on Brothers & Sisters

00:02.120 --> 00:02.760
what is this?

00:02.760 --> 00:04.580
It's my letter of resignation

00:04.580 --> 00:05.689
I hate this party

00:05.689 --> 00:06.800
Nora that's enough

00:06.800 --> 00:10.420
The very thing that you like at least about
Kitty is that I love the most about her.

00:10.420 --> 00:12.230
I want it to be different with you

00:12.230 --> 00:13.620
William had another lover.

00:13.620 --> 00:16.090
and they had a child together

00:16.090 --> 00:16.860
Ryan

00:16.860 --> 00:19.040
I will very impress
of the partners meeting

00:19.040 --> 00:20.080
I'll keep an eye on you.

00:20.080 --> 00:22.010
Is Robert really gonna make
you quit if you publish?

00:22.010 --> 00:25.690
I certainly can't work with the
people that I wrote a book about.

00:25.690 --> 00:30.240
When you're ready to have a real
relationship with me, I'll be here.

00:30.240 --> 00:33.080
It doesn't feel like
our company anymore.

00:33.080 --> 00:34.120
I'm quitting

00:34.120 --> 00:37.130
I was trying to find Ryan Lafferty

00:37.130 --> 00:39.280
Not a problem

00:40.280 --> 00:43.000
I talk from the downtown arts

00:43.000 --> 00:46.340
she told me everything I need to
know about starting up non-profit

00:46.340 --> 00:48.940
so welcome to the nerve center

00:49.620 --> 00:51.530
nerve center, I could see this.

00:51.530 --> 00:52.940
so told me I need space,

00:52.940 --> 00:56.460
where can I talk to potential
donors, interview volunteers

00:56.460 --> 00:58.560
begin to write proposal and grants

00:58.560 --> 01:00.570
and I need lines, 3 telephone lines

01:00.570 --> 01:03.700
a printer that copies
or copy with the prints

01:03.700 --> 01:05.310
I even waste a dime

01:05.310 --> 01:07.370
Am I gonna dead before
I even begin with this

01:07.370 --> 01:10.820
please moms, everything is
gonna be okay, alright okay

01:10.820 --> 01:12.320
first thing first

01:12.320 --> 01:13.820
I want it all get stuff out of here

01:13.820 --> 01:15.690
okay, what do you want to go?

01:16.040 --> 01:19.290
the couch, the chair, the lamp, the desk

01:19.290 --> 01:20.770
wait the dad's desk?

01:20.770 --> 01:22.590
he's not using it

01:22.590 --> 01:24.690
I just figures that maybe you want to

01:24.690 --> 01:25.700
no, it is not me

01:25.700 --> 01:27.800
it is big cranky George Washington thing

01:27.800 --> 01:29.920
I want it light and Arian here

01:29.920 --> 01:31.200
not a book line tomb

01:31.200 --> 01:32.360
Can we get rid of this paneling maybe

01:32.360 --> 01:34.020
so where is this stuff going

01:34.020 --> 01:36.360
to the garage.

01:36.360 --> 01:37.810
what?

01:38.420 --> 01:40.650
I
- I just forgot we had one.

01:44.070 --> 01:45.760
oh, dear god in heaven.

01:45.760 --> 01:47.450
this is why we don't park here.

01:47.450 --> 01:49.910
it's like it’s all been breeding.

01:49.910 --> 01:51.560
all right, you know what?
let's step back slowly.

01:51.560 --> 01:53.940
we'll shut the door. we'll call
one of these storage places,

01:53.940 --> 01:55.230
and they'll come get it all at once.

01:55.230 --> 01:59.000
well, that seems silly to pay some guys
to move this junk from one spot to another,

01:59.000 --> 02:02.480
and then pay
them to ke--no.

02:02.480 --> 02:03.460
no!

02:03.460 --> 02:04.540
this is it! this is it.

02:04.540 --> 02:08.350
this is the money I need for
my new office-- a garage sale!

02:08.350 --> 02:10.210
I really wanna see the
merchandise before it starts.

02:10.210 --> 02:11.290
relax, j. lo.

02:11.290 --> 02:12.920
we'll have a private sale just for you.

02:12.920 --> 02:14.650
hey, I need stuff for my apartment.

02:14.650 --> 02:15.790
well, I wouldn't get too excited.

02:15.790 --> 02:18.100
it's just a bunch of fishing
rods and fruit crates and stuff.

02:18.100 --> 02:20.350
where you see crates, I see furniture.

02:20.350 --> 02:22.060
hey, hold one a second.

02:22.060 --> 02:22.990
that's my temp agency.

02:22.990 --> 02:23.700
can I call you back?

02:23.700 --> 02:24.580
yeah. sure.

02:24.580 --> 02:26.630
hello? this is Rebecca.

02:26.630 --> 02:27.490
yeah, yeah.

02:27.490 --> 02:29.270
sure, I can work today.

02:31.310 --> 02:33.430
okay, 10. . .

02:33.830 --> 02:35.710
industry. . .

02:36.980 --> 02:39.830
I’m sorry. what company is this?

02:41.560 --> 02:42.250
are you insane?

02:42.250 --> 02:44.300
you think you can just order
me like something on a menu?

02:44.300 --> 02:48.790
well, I have filing needs, and
I was gonna order a temp anyway.

02:48.790 --> 02:50.990
you can't just drag me into your
life whenever you feel like it.

02:50.990 --> 02:52.130
well, you could've said no.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.050
I did. they said they'd
fire me if I didn't show up.

02:54.050 --> 02:55.320
Rebecca, I just
thought it would be--

02:55.320 --> 02:56.820
mom, you lied to me
about who my father is,

02:56.820 --> 02:58.510
and you really think that
just by having me work here,

02:58.510 --> 02:59.890
everything's suddenly gonna be okay?

02:59.890 --> 03:00.770
seriously?

03:00.770 --> 03:02.510
well-- well, frankly, I don't
know why you’re doing a temp job.

03:02.510 --> 03:05.030
you have the $2 million I gave you.

03:05.030 --> 03:07.350
I don't want that money, I told you,
just like I don't want to see you.

03:07.350 --> 03:08.980
well, I wanna see you.

03:08.980 --> 03:10.590
I mean, you don't return my phone calls.

03:10.590 --> 03:12.480
you-- you don't
answer my e-mails.

03:12.480 --> 03:15.990
so I did the pushy maternal thing.

03:15.990 --> 03:17.700
I took a page from Nora’s playbook.

03:17.700 --> 03:19.650
oh, stop always
comparing yourself to her.

03:19.650 --> 03:22.120
you're right. she has
five children, Saul.

03:22.120 --> 03:27.100
I only have you, and I want to
see your face from time to time.

03:27.100 --> 03:30.280
I’m not giving up on us.

03:31.480 --> 03:34.340
where are these files
you want me to organize?

03:34.340 --> 03:38.130
Judy at the front
desk--she'll show you them.

03:44.930 --> 03:47.320
you know, I love that we’re
in a good place these days,

03:47.320 --> 03:51.030
but I’m starting to wonder if you
just don't want to go into Ojai.

03:51.300 --> 03:55.220
well, sex with my beautiful
wife or going to work?

03:55.220 --> 03:56.770
tough call.

03:57.020 --> 03:59.360
I just figured with
both Sarah and Saul gone,

03:59.360 --> 04:01.480
you'd be working even more.

04:01.480 --> 04:04.140
well, there's no one there
second-guessing my every decision,

04:04.140 --> 04:07.810
so the work gets done in half the time.

04:10.240 --> 04:12.780
have you talked to Sarah at all?

04:13.150 --> 04:15.360
no, not since she quit.

04:15.360 --> 04:20.260
even though I, uh, saved Ojai and she
stormed out, she's holding a grudge.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.470
you know Sarah.

04:21.470 --> 04:22.730
maybe you should call her.

04:22.730 --> 04:24.910
or she should call me.

04:25.280 --> 04:29.520
look, I gotta go before
we set some new record.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.230
oh, look at us.

04:38.230 --> 04:39.620
what could be better, huh?

04:39.620 --> 04:42.760
a Tommy Walker doll with little
pins to stick in his eyes.

04:42.760 --> 04:43.400
that's not fair.

04:43.400 --> 04:47.150
if it weren't for Tommy kicking
us out of the family business,

04:47.150 --> 04:49.520
this glorious day wouldn’t be possible.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.100
-that's true.
-true.

04:51.100 --> 04:52.450
-what is this?
-hi, mom.

04:52.450 --> 04:54.070
Nora, come on, join us.

04:54.070 --> 04:55.100
what are you doing here?

04:55.100 --> 04:58.740
nothing, which, can I say, on
a weekday afternoon, is sublime.

04:58.740 --> 05:00.110
sublime.

05:00.110 --> 05:02.680
morning. weekday morning.

05:02.680 --> 05:04.820
you two have an
excuse--unemployed, retired--

05:04.820 --> 05:07.810
but you, sir, have turned me
down for dinner twice this week

05:07.810 --> 05:10.860
because supposedly you’re working
so hard trying to make partner.

05:10.860 --> 05:12.090
and here you are lounging by the pool?

05:12.090 --> 05:16.790
after four all-nighters, the managing
partner gave me a day off, thank you.

05:16.790 --> 05:17.640
well, fine, fine.

05:17.640 --> 05:18.670
then it's my lucky day.

05:18.670 --> 05:20.520
you can all help me
clean out the garage.

05:20.520 --> 05:21.640
I’m having a yard sale.

05:21.640 --> 05:24.590
-you're joking.
-you want me to clean on my only day off?

05:24.590 --> 05:27.390
consider it the first
fund-raiser for my charity.

05:27.390 --> 05:28.440
you've all pledged your support.

05:28.440 --> 05:29.420
now's your chance.

05:29.420 --> 05:30.060
come on.

05:30.060 --> 05:31.730
actually, I don't
have anything in there.

05:31.730 --> 05:32.740
-I don't either
-me neither.

05:32.740 --> 05:35.260
half the stuff in that garage is yours.

05:35.260 --> 05:36.020
no.

05:36.020 --> 05:37.300
oh, wait.

05:37.300 --> 05:39.110
is my Jimmy Carter
photograph still in there?

05:39.110 --> 05:41.470
oh, actually, mom, my
record collection's in there.

05:41.470 --> 05:42.130
okay, fine.

05:42.130 --> 05:45.090
you can either come with me now
and get all your stuff today,

05:45.090 --> 05:47.850
or you can buy it back
from me this weekend.

05:47.850 --> 05:51.070
you would not sell my hand-signed
jimmy carter photograph.

05:51.070 --> 05:52.190
-are you ser- -I
would. I would.

05:52.190 --> 05:53.550
-he signed that for me personally.
-are you serious? are you being serious?

05:53.550 --> 05:57.210
-I have--you'd have to buy it from me. .
. -and it's gonna be very, very expensive.

05:57.210 --> 05:58.810
-my--come on,
Saul! -help, now!

05:58.810 --> 06:00.830
I’ll be there soon!

06:01.200 --> 06:03.200
the Halsey bill lowers
the corporate tax rate.

06:03.200 --> 06:05.500
it allows American businesses
to remain competitive.

06:05.500 --> 06:06.440
it'll keep more jobs here,

06:06.440 --> 06:08.880
stop them from being outsourced
to India, eastern Europe.

06:08.880 --> 06:11.610
now about the shoeshine
museum in Lanesboro, Minnesota?

06:11.610 --> 06:12.790
they need jobs there?

06:12.790 --> 06:15.770
I mean, this thing is bloated with
more pork than I’ve ever--well. . .

06:16.210 --> 06:19.070
it's a fraction of the budget,
not worth scuttling the bill for.

06:19.070 --> 06:20.910
all right, anybody else?

06:20.910 --> 06:22.890
a counter?

06:24.520 --> 06:26.090
a little less dissent next time.

06:27.960 --> 06:28.910
I’m sorry.

06:28.910 --> 06:30.850
uh, Kitty has an announcement.

06:30.850 --> 06:31.950
you were matched.

06:31.950 --> 06:33.070
uh, no. no, no, no.

06:33.070 --> 06:35.370
we're-- we’re still
working on the adoption.

06:35.370 --> 06:38.360
no, this-- this is
actually about, uh, work.

06:38.360 --> 06:41.380
and I just wanted to
tell you myself that,

06:41.750 --> 06:45.240
um, I am stepping down as
your communications director.

06:45.240 --> 06:47.900
I mean, as-- as you know,
I wrote this book, and, uh,

06:47.900 --> 06:50.400
I found a publisher, and, uh. . .

06:50.940 --> 06:54.090
well, you know, it-- it's much easier
to critique policy than to make it.

06:54.090 --> 06:56.490
I’ve decided to gonna go back
to my punditry roots, you know

06:56.490 --> 06:58.510
, at least for the time being.

06:58.510 --> 07:00.550
and I would like to say
that I would miss you all,

07:00.550 --> 07:02.700
but considering that I’m the boss' wife,

07:02.700 --> 07:06.550
you'll probably see me just as
much as if I actually worked here.

07:06.550 --> 07:08.670
and I think that I
can speak for everybody

07:08.670 --> 07:10.530
when I say that it has been an honor.

07:10.530 --> 07:12.090
please.

07:12.470 --> 07:15.550
-thanks, that's it.
-congratulations.

07:21.460 --> 07:23.730
I
- I can't believe this is happening.

07:23.730 --> 07:24.970
yeah.

07:25.570 --> 07:28.460
all right, who are
we interviewing today?

07:30.610 --> 07:34.430
well, that-- that's the list, and
I-I-I think you're gonna be quite happy.

07:34.430 --> 07:36.060
I better be.

07:36.060 --> 07:38.510
I need someone stellar.

07:40.000 --> 07:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:48.170 --> 07:50.600
whoa, it's like an
antique store in here.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.180
what do you
think-- a dollar?

07:52.180 --> 07:53.930
for dad's lucky hat?

07:53.930 --> 07:56.200
okay, $2.

07:56.570 --> 07:57.540
whoa, this is his mitt.

07:57.540 --> 07:59.860
you can't sell his mitt. he taught
me how to play baseball in this.

07:59.860 --> 08:03.910
well, it's falling apart,
but keep it if you want.

08:07.530 --> 08:10.320
mom, these are all dad's things.

08:10.320 --> 08:11.240
yes, I know.

08:11.240 --> 08:13.830
I
- I stuffed them all in the garage right after he died.

08:13.830 --> 08:15.940
I couldn't deal with
it then, but I can now.

08:15.940 --> 08:17.560
but don't-- don't you want
to keep some of this stuff?

08:17.560 --> 08:19.420
sweetheart, honestly,
take whatever you want.

08:19.420 --> 08:21.710
I don't begrudge you wanting to
take something of your father's.

08:21.710 --> 08:26.510
but I really don't see any point to keep his
shoehorn and his walking stick and his. . .

08:27.100 --> 08:27.970
the monkey?

08:27.970 --> 08:28.900
you can't sell the monkey.

08:28.900 --> 08:30.660
ma, this has been in the living
room since I’ve been born.

08:30.660 --> 08:32.590
it's a tacky figurine from a gift shop.

08:32.590 --> 08:34.870
that he bought on your honeymoon.

08:34.870 --> 08:37.169
for tw-- you're--25
cents, mom?

08:37.169 --> 08:39.150
I need to clear some
space for my office.

08:39.150 --> 08:42.360
I can't do that if I have to
hold onto every knick-knack

08:42.360 --> 08:45.600
that has some sort of
memory attached to it.

08:53.850 --> 08:55.530
what's going on in there is not right.

08:55.530 --> 08:58.100
she's selling all of dad's
stuff--like, every trace of him.

08:58.100 --> 08:59.880
well, maybe she's coping.

08:59.880 --> 09:02.000
maybe it's good for her.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.430
she doesn't need to live in a memorial
to the man who betrayed her, Justin.

09:05.430 --> 09:06.780
you know what?
there--there's more than that.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.070
you know, there--
there was love there.

09:08.070 --> 09:09.130
there were good times.

09:09.130 --> 09:11.090
and he screwed that up, didn't he?

09:11.090 --> 09:12.660
just let her do it.

09:12.660 --> 09:15.620
it's what she needs to do.

09:16.750 --> 09:19.840
I also developed the p. r. rollout for
the "network covered" health care plan.

09:19.840 --> 09:21.240
oh, it's a very impressive campaign.

09:21.240 --> 09:24.270
yeah, Sean studied the health care
market at, uh, at-- was it Harvard?

09:24.270 --> 09:25.520
-Harvard, yes.
-Harvard.

09:25.520 --> 09:26.600
yes, Harvard business school.

09:26.620 --> 09:28.070
good. let me ask you. . .

09:28.070 --> 09:29.570
-the Halsey
bill- -great bill.

09:29.570 --> 09:32.900
has its pork, but you
campaigned on creating jobs.

09:32.900 --> 09:35.170
voters will appreciate your consistency.

09:35.170 --> 09:38.820
keep it up, you're in prime position
for another run at the presidency.

09:41.780 --> 09:42.720
thank you, Sean.

09:42.720 --> 09:43.940
I really appreciate it.

09:43.940 --> 09:44.690
thank you, senator.

09:44.690 --> 09:46.110
bye, Sean.

09:46.660 --> 09:48.750
uh, well, we'll, uh, uh. . .

09:48.750 --> 09:50.050
we'll-- we'll
be in touch.

09:50.050 --> 09:50.900
thanks, Sean.

09:50.900 --> 09:53.210
all right, who else are we seeing?

09:58.550 --> 10:00.690
personnel files are all integrated.

10:00.690 --> 10:03.310
so do you want me to just
leave them on the table?

10:03.310 --> 10:04.900
you're finished?

10:04.900 --> 10:08.100
I figured that would
take you a couple days.

10:08.100 --> 10:11.730
well, I had incentive to work quickly.

10:12.260 --> 10:13.020
can you sign this?

10:13.020 --> 10:17.460
the agency needs it, just to,
uh, show them that I worked.

10:17.920 --> 10:20.390
have a busy weekend planned?

10:20.390 --> 10:22.810
no, not really.

10:23.250 --> 10:26.070
well, thanks for your hard work.

10:26.070 --> 10:29.780
it was nice today, seeing you.

10:34.890 --> 10:37.150
you gonna go home soon?

10:37.150 --> 10:38.440
I have nothing else to do.

10:38.440 --> 10:39.710
quiet weekend.

10:39.710 --> 10:43.230
figured I might as well
get through these by Monday.

10:45.560 --> 10:47.600
bye.

10:56.550 --> 10:59.610
so you're not hiring anybody
that-- that you interviewed today?

10:59.610 --> 11:01.050
uh, no.

11:01.850 --> 11:02.880
what?

11:02.880 --> 11:03.930
you have to bring me more people.

11:03.930 --> 11:07.160
uh, r-Robert, Robert,
these are the guys.

11:07.160 --> 11:10.130
I
- I had to call in favors just to get them to come in for an interview.

11:10.130 --> 11:11.710
these are not the guys, okay?

11:11.710 --> 11:13.370
if they are, we're in a lot of trouble.

11:13.370 --> 11:15.580
this staff is populated
by ivy league yes-men.

11:15.580 --> 11:18.410
get me somebody who will wow me.

11:18.410 --> 11:19.170
wow you?

11:19.170 --> 11:21.520
you-- you--you
need to be wowed?

11:21.520 --> 11:23.550
when I hired you, I saw that "thing.

11:23.550 --> 11:26.000
"you brought that "thing” to the office.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.150
find me that.

11:28.150 --> 11:30.190
okay, do you maybe
want to quantify that?

11:30.190 --> 11:31.210
you know it when you see it.

11:31.210 --> 11:33.920
you know what? I’m starting to think
that this isn't about the interviews.

11:33.920 --> 11:37.110
every guy that came in here today
to interview with you just-- just

11:37.110 --> 11:38.210
what, wasn't good enough?

11:38.210 --> 11:39.120
well, you gotta keep looking.

11:39.120 --> 11:41.880
okay, fine, but you need to help me and you
need to tell me what you're looking for. . .

11:41.880 --> 11:44.630
because every single one of
these guys had the "thing,

11:44.630 --> 11:46.090
"if you would just give them a chance.

11:46.090 --> 11:48.600
I mean, they are experienced
and they're whip smart.

11:48.600 --> 11:51.080
they're not good enough.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.920
they're not you.

11:59.890 --> 12:03.340
okay, this is everything from the
nether reaches of the hall closet.

12:03.340 --> 12:04.770
I advise you to toss it.

12:04.770 --> 12:05.990
I think I saw mouse droppings.

12:05.990 --> 12:08.380
oh, they're cedar pellets. . .

12:08.380 --> 12:11.270
little dark brown cedar pellets.

12:11.740 --> 12:13.310
whose kneepads are these?

12:13.310 --> 12:15.820
I think Sarah used those as
breasts all through middle school.

12:15.820 --> 12:17.060
oh, yeah. yeah, right.

12:17.060 --> 12:18.460
like I needed them.

12:18.460 --> 12:20.310
I’d be very careful, Kevin Walker.

12:20.310 --> 12:25.090
I just found your break dance pants.

12:26.180 --> 12:28.910
Sarah, Sarah, this is all dad's stuff.

12:28.910 --> 12:30.040
she's selling all of dad's stuff.

12:30.040 --> 12:31.080
I know.

12:31.080 --> 12:33.400
if you wanna take something, go ahead.

12:33.400 --> 12:34.640
I did.

12:34.640 --> 12:36.280
w-- don't-- don't you think
we should say something to her?

12:36.280 --> 12:38.020
and what would we say?

12:38.020 --> 12:38.880
it's been two years.

12:38.880 --> 12:41.020
she wants to move on wither
life. can you blame her?

12:41.020 --> 12:44.220
but what if she wants some of this stuff
back to, like, try and remember dad?

12:44.220 --> 12:48.020
well, the five of us are pretty good
reminders of dad, don't you think?

12:48.020 --> 12:50.570
oh, my god.

12:51.050 --> 12:52.500
"da doo ron ron.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.070
"I loved Shaun Cassidy.

12:54.070 --> 12:55.540
remember this?

12:55.540 --> 12:56.720
fondly.

12:56.720 --> 12:58.150
it was my record.

12:58.150 --> 12:59.310
don't think so.

12:59.310 --> 13:01.050
"property of Kevin
Walker” right there, babe.

13:01.050 --> 13:04.140
ah, yeah. that's because after I left
for college, you pilfered my room, babe

13:04.140 --> 13:07.220
, and put your lame "property of
Kevin Walker" labels over everything

13:07.220 --> 13:08.320
so I’d never get it back.

13:08.320 --> 13:11.750
could we please price and organize
while we stroll down memory lane?

13:11.750 --> 13:14.830
we have so much to
do--Tommy, perfect timing.

13:14.830 --> 13:15.870
you got my message.

13:15.870 --> 13:18.730
yeah, you mean your threats of
selling off my football trophies?

13:18.730 --> 13:19.800
nice. hey, guys.

13:19.800 --> 13:22.470
yeah, uh, listen, I’m gonna go
now and get some pizza for dinner.

13:22.470 --> 13:23.710
wait, I think I’m blocking you in.

13:23.710 --> 13:25.820
why don't I drive?

13:28.080 --> 13:30.640
wow, look at all this stuff.

13:33.130 --> 13:35.470
it's the time capsule.

13:36.470 --> 13:39.230
uh, this is supposed
to be in the ground.

13:39.230 --> 13:40.190
Sarah and I buried it.

13:40.190 --> 13:42.590
well, I think the gardeners dug it
up when they were doing some planting.

13:42.590 --> 13:45.140
I
- I really was meaning to rebury it, actually.

13:45.140 --> 13:46.140
it's no big deal, mom.

13:46.140 --> 13:47.940
well, it was when we were kids.

13:47.940 --> 13:49.090
you guys were so cute.

13:49.090 --> 13:51.050
you wouldn't tell me anything
you were putting inside.

13:51.050 --> 13:52.960
it was all completely confidential.

13:52.960 --> 13:54.120
mom, it's almost 6:00.

13:54.120 --> 13:56.890
you wanted me to remind you
about the craigslist deadline.

13:56.890 --> 13:58.130
yes, craigslist.

13:58.130 --> 14:00.490
uh, Justin, help me-- help
me make a listing, will you?

14:00.490 --> 14:01.710
-what? you don't need my help.
-I need your help.

14:01.710 --> 14:04.140
why don't you guys open
it up, see what's inside?

14:04.140 --> 14:05.610
yeah.

14:08.180 --> 14:09.500
I can't believe she did this.

14:09.500 --> 14:13.580
I mean, we made her swear to us she
wouldn't go near that burial site.

14:13.930 --> 14:15.990
yeah, maybe she forgot.

14:15.990 --> 14:17.750
I did.

14:18.860 --> 14:20.790
okay, so this is how it’s gonna be now?

14:20.790 --> 14:23.340
what, do you expect me to
chitchat like nothing's happened?

14:23.340 --> 14:24.950
you quit.

14:24.950 --> 14:27.280
you left me scrambling to
salvage Ojai after you--

14:27.280 --> 14:29.700
after I what, put the
company in jeopardy?

14:29.700 --> 14:31.300
I know, Tommy. thank you. I know.

14:31.300 --> 14:32.420
nobody asked you to leave.

14:32.420 --> 14:34.280
you made it pretty hard for
me to stay, and you know it.

14:34.280 --> 14:36.910
the only reason you quit is 'cause
you can't stand not being the boss.

14:36.910 --> 14:40.070
no, I quit because I couldn't stand
watching what you were doing to Ojai.

14:40.070 --> 14:42.320
what I was doing? saving the company?

14:42.320 --> 14:43.920
I mean, that's all
I’ve tried to do here.

14:43.920 --> 14:45.420
nobody seems to see that.

14:45.420 --> 14:46.190
right.

14:46.190 --> 14:47.160
I mean, that's what dad would’ve done.

14:47.160 --> 14:48.350
oh, right, of course.

14:48.350 --> 14:50.680
that's why he left you in charge.

14:50.680 --> 14:51.910
oh, no. wait. . .

14:51.910 --> 14:53.710
he didn't.

14:54.430 --> 14:56.880
wow, you-- you-- you-- you
really want to go there?

14:56.880 --> 14:58.290
just be honest with yourself, Tommy.

14:58.290 --> 15:00.590
you've never gotten over the fact
that dad brought me in over you.

15:00.590 --> 15:01.840
screw you.

15:01.840 --> 15:05.140
you just can't stomach
the fact that you failed!

15:05.140 --> 15:06.630
you're pathetic, Tommy.

15:06.630 --> 15:09.340
you're just Holly’s little bitch.

15:10.430 --> 15:12.440
unbelievable.

15:16.940 --> 15:19.940
I love how much you can tell about the
people in a house by their yard sales.

15:19.940 --> 15:22.410
it's like a window into their lives.

15:22.410 --> 15:26.220
great, so the whole neighborhood’s
gonna knowhow my mom feels about my dad.

15:26.850 --> 15:27.980
you okay?

15:27.980 --> 15:29.260
yeah.

15:29.260 --> 15:31.070
no. look, I get why she’s
trying to move on, right?

15:31.070 --> 15:33.800
but she's trying to pretend
he didn't even exist.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.250
look, I know he screwed up, but, you
know, I’m not--I’m not defending him,

15:36.250 --> 15:39.140
but it’s like, if my parents were to cut me
out of their lives every time I screwed up,

15:39.140 --> 15:41.170
they would've disowned
me a long time ago.

15:41.170 --> 15:42.430
but that's the thing
about family, right?

15:42.430 --> 15:46.540
people screw up, you're stuck with
them you don't just get to cut 'em off.

15:46.540 --> 15:48.360
you sound like my mother.

15:48.360 --> 15:50.250
well, your mom's. . .

15:50.250 --> 15:51.860
different.

15:51.860 --> 15:53.190
yeah.

15:54.480 --> 15:56.420
it's different.

15:56.420 --> 15:59.170
speaking of which, you never
told me how, uh, how work went.

15:59.170 --> 16:01.510
uh, it was okay, actually.

16:01.510 --> 16:02.690
it was okay?

16:02.690 --> 16:05.730
what, did your mom call
in sick or something?

16:05.730 --> 16:07.870
no, I was just stuck in
a conference room all day.

16:07.870 --> 16:09.400
I didn't really see her much.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.860
you lucked out, huh?

16:11.860 --> 16:13.000
yep.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.410
we should probably get a move on.

16:14.410 --> 16:16.190
I told your mom we’d be
there on the early side.

16:16.190 --> 16:18.030
she's so excited.

16:18.030 --> 16:21.430
she assigned us to books and videos.

16:21.430 --> 16:23.320
I’m staying here.

16:23.320 --> 16:24.370
I’m watching the game.

16:24.370 --> 16:25.670
no, no, no, no.

16:25.670 --> 16:27.110
no, you volunteered us to help.

16:27.110 --> 16:29.260
look, you go. I’ll watch the baby.

16:29.260 --> 16:30.740
no, I’m taking her.

16:30.740 --> 16:32.020
she wants to see everybody.

16:32.020 --> 16:34.210
come on, Tommy, at least
just make an appearance.

16:34.210 --> 16:37.270
I just can't handle
another Walker tribunal.

16:37.270 --> 16:40.350
will you just tell me what
happened over there yesterday?

16:40.790 --> 16:41.940
nothing.

16:41.940 --> 16:42.940
same old crap.

16:42.940 --> 16:46.850
I
- I save the company from going down, and I’m the bad guy.

16:46.850 --> 16:49.200
when things turn around at
Ojai, they'll understand.

16:49.200 --> 16:52.810
Ojai could make $100 million, and
Sarah would still say I was wrong.

16:52.810 --> 16:56.340
I mean, d-- it makes her feel
better about her own screw-ups.

16:56.340 --> 16:58.800
I don't care if they sit
around and bitch all day.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.350
I’m tired of defending myself.

17:01.350 --> 17:04.310
she's selling mad libs that
we've already filled out.

17:05.980 --> 17:07.119
remember Halloween, when I was 10?

17:07.119 --> 17:08.440
oh, yeah, the Hulk.

17:08.440 --> 17:10.750
and you wore those
embarrassing denim gauchos.

17:10.750 --> 17:11.640
they weren't gauchos.

17:11.640 --> 17:13.900
my pants split open when
I couldn't contain my rage.

17:13.900 --> 17:17.109
yeah, well, all I remember is
green makeup all over the walls.

17:17.109 --> 17:20.589
well, thank you for ruining
my one macho childhood memory.

17:20.589 --> 17:22.099
god, this is weird.

17:22.099 --> 17:25.859
I feel like he's here, like he's gonna walk over
and take this away from me because it's sharp.

17:25.859 --> 17:27.369
you know what? I think it's creepy.

17:27.369 --> 17:29.770
I’m surprised mom's held onto
all this stuff for so long.

17:29.770 --> 17:34.170
I mean, if-- if Scotty cheated on me multiple
times, I’d build a bonfire and throw it all on.

17:34.170 --> 17:36.430
yeah, well, I’ll be sure
and warn Scotty about that.

17:36.430 --> 17:37.680
where-- where
is he anyway?

17:37.680 --> 17:38.940
working a private party.

17:38.940 --> 17:39.840
where's your other half?

17:39.840 --> 17:41.340
oh, I guess he stopped by the office.

17:41.340 --> 17:43.530
I’m sure he'll be here.

17:44.910 --> 17:46.210
what's the matter? trouble in paradise?

17:46.210 --> 17:49.270
well, it turns out that when you write
a book about your husband's campaign,

17:49.270 --> 17:51.420
and-- and then you
quit working for him,

17:51.420 --> 17:53.690
it's-- it's not that
great for a marriage.

17:53.690 --> 17:55.230
I thought he was supportive.

17:55.230 --> 17:56.890
we all let it go. why doesn't he?

17:56.890 --> 17:59.290
I don't know. for some reason,
he's making it difficult for me.

17:59.290 --> 18:00.550
"for some reason"?

18:00.550 --> 18:02.710
how about 'cause he's only
thinking about what's in it for him?

18:02.710 --> 18:06.150
Kevin, can we please stop
with the "I hate Robert" thing?

18:06.150 --> 18:08.120
it's-- it's early,
and-- and the truth is,

18:08.120 --> 18:10.440
maybe I didn't consider
him enough in my decision.

18:10.440 --> 18:12.670
I mean, I could stay on
his staff for a bit longer.

18:12.670 --> 18:15.300
what? kit, you've written
an incredible book. okay?

18:15.300 --> 18:17.060
he needs to support you.

18:17.060 --> 18:19.560
you've supported him zealously
from the first day you met.

18:19.560 --> 18:20.470
you've pumped him up.

18:20.470 --> 18:22.900
now it's his turn to pump you.

18:22.900 --> 18:24.420
I think that's sweet.

18:24.420 --> 18:25.580
-hello.
-welcome.

18:25.580 --> 18:27.140
do you like to fish?

18:27.140 --> 18:30.300
oh, tell Sarah to set up a
tool table right out front.

18:30.300 --> 18:31.250
a tool table?

18:31.250 --> 18:36.720
yeah, so you can put dad’s power saws and his
drills and that vise-y thing with the clamp.

18:36.720 --> 18:42.090
if the tools are out front, then the husbands are
more likely to stop when the wives tell them to.

18:42.090 --> 18:43.990
look, ma, are you sure you want
to get rid of everything out there?

18:43.990 --> 18:47.060
people are gonna start coming by any minute
now, and when that stuff's gone, it's gone.

18:47.060 --> 18:48.460
Justin, we've been through all of this.

18:48.460 --> 18:52.260
-I need to clear the space for my office,
yes. -for your-- for your office, right.

18:53.190 --> 18:53.820
what?

18:53.820 --> 18:57.560
all right, look, I know how hard it must have
been to find out that dad had another affair, okay?

18:57.560 --> 19:02.250
but I-I just don't know if this sale is you acting
out--not-- not that you don’t have a reason to act out but--

19:02.250 --> 19:04.930
-I’m not.
-I get why you're angry.

19:04.930 --> 19:07.870
I’m not angry or hurt or upset.

19:07.870 --> 19:11.040
honestly, the-- the only
thing I feel is relief.

19:11.040 --> 19:12.890
you're relieved that dad slept around?

19:12.890 --> 19:16.880
all right, I felt betrayed when
I first found out about Holly.

19:16.880 --> 19:19.180
and then as time went on, I. . .

19:19.180 --> 19:21.050
I started to believe
that he really loved her.

19:21.050 --> 19:23.070
I mean, he was with her for 20 years.

19:23.070 --> 19:25.580
and it-- it
would. . .

19:25.580 --> 19:30.630
it would just go around and around in my
head, "what did she give him that I didn't?

19:30.630 --> 19:32.310
"and now
I know--

19:32.310 --> 19:37.660
she didn't give him anything that I
didn't, cause your father didn’t love Holly.

19:37.660 --> 19:38.580
he didn't love me.

19:38.580 --> 19:40.790
he was a cheat, plain and simple.

19:40.790 --> 19:44.020
it was his problem, not mine.

19:46.480 --> 19:50.020
it is nice to have friends
in such high places.

19:50.020 --> 19:51.390
high places?

19:51.390 --> 19:54.440
you haven't seen my cubicle down
at the county clerk's office.

19:54.440 --> 19:57.060
regardless, I really
appreciate you helping me.

19:57.060 --> 19:59.250
it's just a few strokes of the keyboard.

19:59.250 --> 20:02.770
I’ve got everything the
state has on Ryan Lafferty--

20:02.770 --> 20:05.840
permanent home address, number,
schools, parent information.

20:05.840 --> 20:09.890
wonderful. my daughter will
be thrilled to see him again.

20:11.300 --> 20:13.070
Holly. . .

20:13.070 --> 20:16.690
you're not the first person
to ask me for information.

20:17.130 --> 20:21.560
I don't want to get involved in
something that can come back and bite me.

20:25.340 --> 20:30.970
recently, I found out some information
about this man that I was really close to,

20:30.970 --> 20:33.410
and I had some questions.

20:33.410 --> 20:38.520
but he passed, and I was hoping that Ryan
Lafferty could give me some of those answers.

20:38.520 --> 20:40.710
it's nothing illegal.

20:40.710 --> 20:42.840
I swear.

20:48.350 --> 20:51.330
thank you so much.

21:12.450 --> 21:16.270
two of my sons wore this for their high
school yearbook picture. they looked so cute.

21:16.270 --> 21:18.730
it must have been 100 degrees,
but they had to wear corduroy.

21:18.730 --> 21:20.250
mom, I really don't think
she needs to hear that.

21:20.250 --> 21:21.290
it's $10.

21:21.290 --> 21:23.600
mm, it's missing a couple buttons.

21:23.600 --> 21:24.660
how's $5?

21:24.660 --> 21:26.080
if you wanna pay twice.

21:26.080 --> 21:27.370
it's not negotiable.

21:27.370 --> 21:28.640
$10.

21:28.640 --> 21:30.730
she's the boss.

21:32.050 --> 21:35.120
and a mess is not allowed hey, Nora,
do you know who this belongs to?

21:35.120 --> 21:36.650
no, I’ve never seen it before.

21:36.650 --> 21:37.950
but if you want it, it's yours.

21:37.950 --> 21:40.230
$3 for you, too.

21:40.230 --> 21:41.810
$3? no, no, no.

21:41.810 --> 21:43.740
no, no, this is definitely
worth, like, $50.

21:43.740 --> 21:44.690
do you-- do
you see that?

21:44.690 --> 21:45.460
that-- that's
authentic.

21:45.460 --> 21:47.400
oh, no. $3 is enough
for an old golf ball.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.790
no, not for the one dad
had Arnold palmer sign.

21:49.790 --> 21:51.500
oh, so he said.

21:51.500 --> 21:53.120
no, $3 is just fine.

21:53.120 --> 21:55.060
$3. $3.

21:55.060 --> 21:56.070
-Nora.
-senator.

21:56.070 --> 21:57.920
good stuff. very tasty.

21:57.920 --> 21:59.890
it's a mix.

22:04.060 --> 22:04.910
what you got here?

22:04.910 --> 22:06.210
g. I. Joe!

22:08.210 --> 22:09.870
with eagle eye vision?

22:09.870 --> 22:12.830
oh, my god. I wanted one of these.
my parents would not buy this for me.

22:12.830 --> 22:15.650
they said I had25 of the old ones, and
they were tired of tripping on them.

22:15.650 --> 22:16.660
is he a '75?

22:16.660 --> 22:18.430
eagle eye vision didn't
come out till '76.

22:18.430 --> 22:19.720
he's first gen.

22:19.720 --> 22:20.820
how much you want for him?

22:20.820 --> 22:21.860
a lot.

22:21.860 --> 22:22.780
-name your price.
-you know what?

22:22.780 --> 22:24.420
I’ll probably just hold on to him.

22:24.420 --> 22:25.970
I don't think he has
any tours left in him.

22:25.970 --> 22:27.900
he's gonna sit on a
bookshelf and have some r & r.

22:27.900 --> 22:28.650
you say that now.

22:28.650 --> 22:31.690
next thing you know, he's off fighting
an endless and unnecessary war.

22:31.690 --> 22:32.530
you never give it up, do you?

22:32.530 --> 22:36.300
I’m just expressing my opinions
to my elected representative.

22:36.300 --> 22:38.290
oh, we have some broomsticks
you may be interested in.

22:38.290 --> 22:40.110
you could turn 'em into lances.

22:40.110 --> 22:41.770
what the hell are you talking about?

22:41.770 --> 22:44.120
for the 200-seat jousting
stadium in rural Maryland.

22:44.120 --> 22:46.830
or how about some loam for the
truth gardening Harvey, Iowa?

22:46.830 --> 22:47.770
you're aware of the Halsey bill?

22:47.770 --> 22:49.440
oh, wait. is that the
one with all the. . .

22:49.440 --> 22:50.960
pork yes, I am.

22:50.960 --> 22:51.820
that's funny.

22:51.820 --> 22:53.390
it's not as good as your dinosaur.

22:53.390 --> 22:54.820
so you and Kitty are
discussing my votes?

22:54.820 --> 22:57.500
no, I actually read the news, but
I don't need to debate anything.

22:57.500 --> 23:00.550
I don't know a democrat or a
republican in favor of useless spending.

23:00.550 --> 23:01.990
the spending's not useless.

23:01.990 --> 23:03.670
it's a good bill. there's
just a cost for passing it.

23:03.670 --> 23:05.270
it's not a good bill.

23:05.270 --> 23:10.110
corporations aren't gonna use the generous tax refunds
you’re offering to create new jobs in this country.

23:10.110 --> 23:12.740
they're just gonna hide their
profits in offshore tax havens.

23:12.740 --> 23:14.210
that's what I’m gonna
advise my clients to do.

23:14.210 --> 23:16.400
that's why I have a tax
haven abuse law in committee.

23:16.400 --> 23:17.710
if it gets out, you
won’t be able to do that.

23:17.710 --> 23:20.120
yeah, talk to me when
it's out of committee.

23:20.120 --> 23:21.370
you know, if you and Kitty
weren’t discussing my--

23:21.370 --> 23:23.780
Kitty didn't have to give up
her job to come work for you.

23:23.780 --> 23:24.660
she chose to.

23:24.660 --> 23:27.390
she gave up a ridiculously
successful career--

23:27.390 --> 23:28.490
for an equally rewarding one.

23:28.490 --> 23:30.620
yeah, and committed herself
to you and your campaign.

23:30.620 --> 23:32.630
and now you have the opportunity
to show some gratitude--

23:32.630 --> 23:34.190
I’m the one who
encouraged her to publish.

23:34.190 --> 23:37.520
so what, now she wants to leave,
you wanna make her feel guilty?

23:39.030 --> 23:39.950
you want that?

23:39.950 --> 23:42.700
take it. it's yours.

23:46.380 --> 23:47.640
all right.

23:47.640 --> 23:50.780
hey, do either of you
know where this came from?

23:50.780 --> 23:53.090
oh, that, uh, that used to
hanging, uh, dad's office, right?

23:53.090 --> 23:54.560
um, I don't remember it.

23:54.560 --> 23:56.060
so you have no idea who painted it?

23:56.060 --> 23:57.600
one guess. . .

23:57.600 --> 23:59.440
not Picasso.

23:59.440 --> 24:00.870
hey-oh!

24:00.870 --> 24:02.520
-uncle Saul!
-how's that for uncle Saul?

24:06.210 --> 24:07.880
uh, dawn, right?

24:07.880 --> 24:10.820
I’m-- I’m Justin. I used to, uh,
I used to babysit you, remember?

24:10.820 --> 24:12.450
uh, I don't remember you babysitting.

24:12.450 --> 24:15.430
I do remember you putting me to
bed two hours before my bedtime,

24:15.430 --> 24:18.650
and you and your friends
partying in the family room.

24:18.650 --> 24:20.490
but I did check on you.

24:21.160 --> 24:21.820
so. . .

24:21.820 --> 24:23.230
25 cents for the monkey?

24:23.230 --> 24:24.370
uh, yeah.

24:24.370 --> 24:25.740
no, no, no.

24:25.740 --> 24:27.220
uh, this-- this
is not for sale.

24:27.220 --> 24:28.940
this is a-a family heirloom.

24:28.940 --> 24:30.050
uh, it shouldn't even be here.

24:30.050 --> 24:32.120
come on! I collect them.

24:32.120 --> 24:34.980
monkeys are my totem animal.

24:34.980 --> 24:36.710
uh, your--
your what?

24:36.710 --> 24:38.190
my spirit, the light and the dark.

24:38.190 --> 24:40.560
well, uh, spirit aside,
this--this isn't for sale. sorry.

24:41.230 --> 24:42.550
oh! dawn.

24:42.550 --> 24:43.960
dawn, hi!

24:43.960 --> 24:45.170
look at you!

24:45.170 --> 24:46.070
my goodness.

24:46.070 --> 24:47.360
how are your folks?

24:47.360 --> 24:49.080
what-- are you--are
you buying the monkey?

24:49.080 --> 24:52.520
I’m trying to, but Justin’s
all like, "it's an heirloom.

24:52.520 --> 24:55.800
"Justin, it-- it's-- the
monkey, it's 25 cents.

24:55.800 --> 24:56.570
-mom!
-awesome.

24:56.570 --> 24:57.720
thank you.

24:57.720 --> 24:58.940
-give her the
monkey. -no, I don't-

24:58.940 --> 25:00.950
give her the monkey.

25:11.620 --> 25:12.410
hey.

25:12.410 --> 25:15.370
you would not believe how people
are guzzling this stuff down.

25:15.370 --> 25:18.570
somehow I’ve become, like,
designated lemonade wench.

25:20.010 --> 25:21.260
oh, god. is--
is she asleep?

25:21.260 --> 25:23.020
-yeah.
-sorry.

25:23.300 --> 25:24.100
any new words?

25:24.100 --> 25:25.150
uh, "uppy.

25:25.150 --> 25:26.710
"uppy"?

25:26.710 --> 25:28.020
oh, you're in trouble.

25:28.020 --> 25:31.460
she's not gonna want to put those
little feet back on the ground.

25:31.460 --> 25:33.220
if you want to take a break,
I can totally watch her.

25:33.220 --> 25:35.690
no thanks. I’m fine.

25:36.540 --> 25:38.990
are we okay?

25:39.910 --> 25:42.990
well, if you haven't noticed,
Elizabeth and I came by ourselves.

25:42.990 --> 25:45.480
Tommy didn't really feel
comfortable showing up today.

25:45.480 --> 25:48.910
oh, well. that is, uh, Tommy’s choice.

25:48.910 --> 25:50.860
is it?

25:50.860 --> 25:55.460
because I think you, Kevin and Saul made
it pretty clear he’s not welcome here.

25:56.100 --> 25:59.000
look, Julia, I’d really prefer
not to get into this with you.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.830
it's between me and Tommy.

26:00.830 --> 26:02.010
it's business.

26:02.010 --> 26:05.720
that's what you both keep
saying, but it's not, Sarah.

26:05.720 --> 26:06.770
he's really hurt.

26:06.770 --> 26:08.060
you think I’m not?

26:08.060 --> 26:12.610
the-- the last time I looked, Tommy’s running
Ojai, I’m out of a job, making lemonade.

26:12.610 --> 26:14.980
Sarah, you made a bad deal.

26:14.980 --> 26:15.940
I’m sorry?

26:15.940 --> 26:18.430
you did, and then they had to
come in and save the company.

26:18.430 --> 26:20.820
and when you didn't like the way
they were running things, you quit.

26:20.820 --> 26:22.150
and you're mad at him?

26:22.150 --> 26:24.290
I think who you’re
really mad at is yourself.

26:24.290 --> 26:28.910
and the sooner you realize that, the
sooner maybe you’ll let Tommy off the hook.

26:37.690 --> 26:39.870
I knew it was an impulse grab.

26:39.870 --> 26:41.780
now I’m gonna have to
put them in our garage,

26:41.780 --> 26:44.710
and, uh, we're eventually gonna
have to have our own yard sale.

26:44.710 --> 26:46.290
it's a--it's a
vicious cycle.

26:46.290 --> 26:48.390
circle? cycle?

26:48.390 --> 26:50.110
-what do you think?
-both are common usage.

26:50.110 --> 26:52.070
"circle" is the more
correct terminology.

26:52.070 --> 26:54.570
well, thank you, Webster, but
I’m talking about the pillows.

26:54.570 --> 26:56.470
that's ugly.

26:56.470 --> 26:57.440
right.

26:57.440 --> 27:02.160
hey, Kevin told me that you're
thinking of not publishing the book?

27:03.030 --> 27:04.100
well--
well, no, no.

27:04.100 --> 27:06.210
I’m just, you know,
considering my options.

27:06.210 --> 27:08.870
well, not publishing isn’t an option.

27:08.870 --> 27:10.380
don't do anything on account of me.

27:10.380 --> 27:11.110
I’m not.

27:11.110 --> 27:14.610
but-- but, honey, I- I know that you're
having a bit of a-- of a problem with it,

27:14.610 --> 27:17.290
-so I just thought that I would be able. .
. to stay on un-- -it's not about the work.

27:17.290 --> 27:22.550
I mean, I-I met you on a
soundstage, discussing politics.

27:22.550 --> 27:26.950
we courted through strategy sessions,
we flirted in campaign rallies,

27:26.950 --> 27:30.040
we wake up and go to sleep on message,

27:30.040 --> 27:33.870
and I don't know where
we are without that.

27:34.980 --> 27:37.890
-look- -I mean, this
happened to Courtney and me.

27:37.890 --> 27:39.280
I was working. she was at home.

27:39.280 --> 27:41.740
eventually, we led
completely separate lives,

27:41.740 --> 27:44.250
and the only thing we had
in common was the kids.

27:44.250 --> 27:46.380
it's not gonna happen to us.

27:46.380 --> 27:49.780
I mean, first of all, I’m--I’m
writing about politics.

27:49.780 --> 27:54.260
and I’m sure that we're gonna go to
bed and we're gonna wake upon topic.

27:54.260 --> 27:59.960
and more importantly, honey, we
are so much more than all that.

27:59.960 --> 28:01.270
-right?
-yeah, yeah.

28:01.270 --> 28:03.740
I mean, a hell of a lot more.

28:04.040 --> 28:08.450
I promise I’m going to find you a
replacement that you're happy with.

28:09.430 --> 28:11.860
everything will be okay.

28:14.970 --> 28:18.800
I left the bags for the
clothes drive by the front door.

28:18.800 --> 28:21.760
okay. you know what? I’ll
take ‘em over tomorrow morning.

28:22.520 --> 28:26.470
all right, so, so far,
we have made $857. . .

28:26.470 --> 28:30.500
mostly in quarters, which is pretty good because
you pretty much gave everything away, so. . .

28:30.500 --> 28:31.930
I can't believe somebody
bought that chair,

28:31.930 --> 28:34.350
the one that Tommy puked in
the first time he got drunk.

28:34.350 --> 28:37.400
and I think I actually puked
init the first time I. . .

28:37.980 --> 28:39.100
you okay?

28:39.100 --> 28:41.820
it's all gone.

28:44.590 --> 28:47.260
but isn't that what you wanted, mom?

28:48.990 --> 28:50.900
yeah.

28:54.170 --> 28:56.360
come here.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.180
it's okay.

28:58.770 --> 29:00.300
it's okay to miss him, mom.

29:00.300 --> 29:03.420
could I just have a moment alone?

29:03.420 --> 29:04.310
I’m okay.

29:04.310 --> 29:06.010
I love you.

29:11.380 --> 29:14.170
hey, I forgot to show you this.

29:15.410 --> 29:17.200
no way. spike!

29:17.200 --> 29:20.120
your mom said you slept with
him till the fifth grade.

29:20.120 --> 29:22.840
thanks, mom. that's--
that's not embarrassing.

29:25.320 --> 29:25.940
look.

29:25.940 --> 29:28.210
-coming!
-spike.

29:29.470 --> 29:31.050
hey.

29:31.840 --> 29:37.030
I managed to save this
before mom sold it.

29:38.560 --> 29:41.690
you wanna see what's inside?

29:41.950 --> 29:43.330
yeah.

29:43.330 --> 29:45.060
come in.

29:54.110 --> 29:55.180
Rebecca?

29:55.180 --> 29:56.520
-somethin' wrong?
-no, no.

29:56.520 --> 30:02.240
um, I was actually just at the
Walkers' garage sale, and, uh. . .

30:02.700 --> 30:04.970
well, this looked familiar.

30:06.250 --> 30:08.650
oh, my god!

30:08.650 --> 30:09.850
you painted that, right?

30:09.850 --> 30:14.260
yeah, during my artistic phase.

30:14.260 --> 30:16.260
ooh, I wasn't very good.

30:16.260 --> 30:17.840
I gave this to William.

30:17.840 --> 30:20.290
I can't believe that he kept this.

30:22.220 --> 30:23.910
thank you.

30:23.910 --> 30:26.220
I thought you might want it.

30:26.220 --> 30:31.140
this is the cabin that you and I rented
the summer before you went into junior high.

30:31.140 --> 30:33.110
oh, yeah, I thought I recognized it.

30:33.110 --> 30:35.470
we used to hike up in
the back, up on the hill.

30:35.470 --> 30:37.790
we'd put our easels
side-by-side. . .

30:37.790 --> 30:39.090
oh, with those hats!

30:39.090 --> 30:41.520
and look down-- yeah!
those straw hats.

30:41.520 --> 30:45.710
yeah, that's because you thought
that we should look like van Gogh.

30:45.710 --> 30:47.850
oh, I can totally picture us.

30:53.730 --> 30:56.750
you were lying to me even then.

30:57.330 --> 31:00.740
Rebecca, I tried to explain. . .

31:00.740 --> 31:03.620
I know-- I owe that you
were protecting me. whatever.

31:03.620 --> 31:05.940
I can't say I’m sorry again,

31:05.940 --> 31:10.740
because clearly that is not
what you wanna hear from me.

31:11.360 --> 31:14.600
I hate that when I look
at you, all I see is lies.

31:15.520 --> 31:17.030
I don't get to remember that summer.

31:17.030 --> 31:23.690
I don't-- I don't get to remember kindergarten
field trips or Easter egg hunts in the backyard.

31:24.660 --> 31:26.800
I remember. . .

31:26.800 --> 31:30.230
how you lied to me my entire life.

31:31.130 --> 31:33.340
you're my mom.

31:34.760 --> 31:37.790
you're the only family I have.

31:39.130 --> 31:41.880
I don't know how to get that back.

31:43.030 --> 31:46.370
one step at a time.

31:48.470 --> 31:52.260
let me earn that trust back.

31:54.870 --> 31:57.440
I don't know that you can.

31:57.440 --> 32:03.270
well, I don't think that I can if we
continue the way that we have been.

32:03.270 --> 32:06.850
I mean, it's impossible to earn
someone's trust when you don't see them

32:06.850 --> 32:10.370
and you don't talk to them.

32:10.880 --> 32:14.970
what if we stay on neutral grounds?

32:15.290 --> 32:17.530
you-- you
work here.

32:17.530 --> 32:20.380
I w-- I have to hire someone
to do the clerical work.

32:20.380 --> 32:23.310
mom, I don't think-- I don’t
think that's a good idea at all.

32:23.310 --> 32:26.900
well, we have to start somewhere.

32:31.230 --> 32:35.130
if I agree to do this,
mom, no more lies.

32:35.130 --> 32:37.440
no more. I
- I won't be able to handle that again.

32:37.440 --> 32:43.500
I swear to you, from
now on, no more lies.

32:49.020 --> 32:50.150
my slinky.

32:50.150 --> 32:53.460
"this time capsule was
buried on July 13, 1979, "

32:53.460 --> 32:57.990
by Sarah and Tommy Walker
of the Pasadena Walkers.

32:58.420 --> 33:00.710
"ugh, it smells like 1979.

33:00.710 --> 33:03.050
sure enough, 30 years
later, it's like new.

33:03.050 --> 33:04.920
the "herald-examiner.

33:04.920 --> 33:06.480
"it doesn't even exist anymore.

33:06.480 --> 33:09.760
what is this, a pastry that
didn't stand the test of time?

33:11.190 --> 33:11.950
oh, no.

33:11.950 --> 33:13.670
soil. . .

33:13.670 --> 33:15.180
from Ojai.

33:15.180 --> 33:16.200
it was from the orange groves.

33:16.200 --> 33:18.980
it was your first summer out
there. you were so excited.

33:18.980 --> 33:21.650
I know. you were so bummed
dad--dad put you in charge of me,

33:21.650 --> 33:23.430
and you told me I was
the soil inspector.

33:23.430 --> 33:25.410
mm-hmm, kept you out
of trouble, didn't I?

33:25.410 --> 33:27.440
god, how many summers did we work there?

33:27.440 --> 33:30.010
and Christmases and spring breaks.

33:30.010 --> 33:32.830
why didn't we just go
surfing like Justin?

33:32.830 --> 33:34.540
or-- or do
London like Kitty?

33:34.540 --> 33:39.640
or just stay home, sulk, listen
to Depeche Mode like Kevin?

33:39.640 --> 33:42.190
why did we always work?

33:43.910 --> 33:47.380
it never felt like work to me.

33:48.380 --> 33:49.740
yeah.

33:49.740 --> 33:51.900
me neither.

33:54.150 --> 33:56.160
is that a tooth?

33:56.160 --> 33:57.050
yeah, it was mine.

33:57.050 --> 33:59.260
Kitty knocked it out twirling her baton.

33:59.260 --> 34:01.320
that's disgusting.

34:01.320 --> 34:05.770
okay, explain to me why we thought that aliens
from the future would be interested in your tooth.

34:05.770 --> 34:08.210
I don't know.

34:08.210 --> 34:09.510
what happened to this guy?

34:09.510 --> 34:11.710
yeah, we don't like to talk about that.

34:11.710 --> 34:12.989
okay, let me get this straight.

34:12.989 --> 34:14.420
"no" on the Halsey bill.

34:14.420 --> 34:15.580
we can do better.

34:15.580 --> 34:16.290
I should do better.

34:16.290 --> 34:18.340
okay, well, you're gonna have to set
a meeting with Evans and explain it,

34:18.340 --> 34:21.860
because he is not gonna be happy to
be surprised on the day of the vote.

34:21.860 --> 34:23.639
hey! come in.

34:23.639 --> 34:25.000
Kevin.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.010
w
- what are you doing here?

34:26.010 --> 34:29.360
I was summoned. if this is about
g. I. Joe, I have one word-- eBay.

34:29.360 --> 34:32.540
I’m sure there’s a whole regiment out
there just waiting for your best offer.

34:32.540 --> 34:34.610
it's not about g. I. Joe.

34:34.610 --> 34:36.570
well, I’m sorry, but what is it about?

34:36.570 --> 34:38.060
I’d like to offer Kevin a job.

34:38.060 --> 34:38.989
-what?
-as what?

34:38.989 --> 34:43.830
I’d like you to consider replacing
Kitty as my communications director.

34:47.449 --> 34:48.489
that's a good one.

34:48.489 --> 34:50.199
that's a good--why
aren't you laughing?

34:50.199 --> 34:52.370
um, you know, honey, that
is not your worst idea.

34:52.370 --> 34:53.270
right, he's perfect.

34:53.270 --> 34:55.360
he's smart, he's informed,
he's a pain in the ass.

34:55.360 --> 34:56.570
thank you.

34:56.570 --> 34:58.220
well, you're not afraid to engage me.

34:58.220 --> 35:01.350
yeah, you know, there-- there's
some sort of perverse sense in this.

35:01.350 --> 35:02.350
I’m really sorry.

35:02.350 --> 35:04.820
have I just walked into
an alternate universe

35:04.820 --> 35:08.870
where being a gay liberal democrat qualifies
you to work for a republican senator?

35:08.870 --> 35:10.660
look, after we talked
at the garage sale--

35:10.660 --> 35:12.340
we fought at the garage sale.

35:12.340 --> 35:14.740
when we fought at the garage
sale, I started thinking,

35:14.740 --> 35:17.360
and we have our differences, but
you're thoughtful about politics.

35:17.360 --> 35:18.500
you've got a mind for policy.

35:18.500 --> 35:21.770
you think about it from a voter's
perspective and not a career politician's.

35:21.770 --> 35:22.720
I need that.

35:22.720 --> 35:26.770
I need someone to challenge me,
someone to provoke me from time to time.

35:26.770 --> 35:28.340
this is so insane.

35:28.340 --> 35:29.060
no, it's not.

35:29.060 --> 35:31.590
you already changed my mind on Halsey.

35:31.590 --> 35:33.080
what, Kevin did that?

35:33.080 --> 35:36.040
even if I did want a career
in politics-- which I don't--

35:36.040 --> 35:40.410
I truly believe that you and your
ilk are destroying this country.

35:40.410 --> 35:42.330
-I know.
-and if I had access to this office,

35:42.330 --> 35:44.980
I would send damaging e-mails
from your computer in the hope

35:44.980 --> 35:47.680
I could bring down you
and your entire party.

35:47.680 --> 35:49.500
oh, you wouldn't do that.

35:49.500 --> 35:50.650
I absolutely would.

35:50.650 --> 35:52.220
you know what? I actually like my job.

35:52.240 --> 35:54.050
I’m well-paid and I’m
on track for partner.

35:54.050 --> 35:55.640
and you have a strong
sense of right and wrong,

35:55.640 --> 35:57.850
which I’m sure is what drew
you to law in the first place.

35:57.850 --> 35:59.730
but, Kevin, you're a corporate lawyer.

35:59.730 --> 36:02.450
you and I both know you spend
most of your days helping companies

36:02.450 --> 36:05.830
that already make a ton of money
figure out ways to make more.

36:05.830 --> 36:06.500
that's part of it.

36:06.500 --> 36:10.070
okay, so if you really believe that
me and my ilk are ruining the country,

36:10.070 --> 36:11.440
now's your chance to
do something about it.

36:11.440 --> 36:12.650
get in the game.

36:12.650 --> 36:13.850
change my mind.

36:13.850 --> 36:15.930
argue with me.

36:15.930 --> 36:19.510
either that or you can spend the next 40 years
sniping at me from across the dinner table.

36:19.510 --> 36:21.830
excuse me, senator. they're ready
for you in the conference room.

36:21.830 --> 36:23.590
I gotta jump in there.

36:23.590 --> 36:25.200
think about it.

36:28.050 --> 36:29.870
did you-- did you
put him up to this?

36:30.750 --> 36:33.000
it's all Robert.

36:50.080 --> 36:52.710
wow, this place looks a lot bigger.

36:52.710 --> 36:55.770
big and empty.

36:57.070 --> 36:59.050
I, um. . .

36:59.050 --> 37:00.940
was out around the neighborhood.

37:00.940 --> 37:02.580
I figured you might want this.

37:02.580 --> 37:03.650
what?

37:03.650 --> 37:05.970
well, I figure, after the
other day, you could use it.

37:05.970 --> 37:10.510
or if not, you can call dawn McCarty,
and she can find a spot for him.

37:11.150 --> 37:13.970
Justin, how did you get so smart?

37:13.970 --> 37:14.630
I’m not.

37:14.630 --> 37:16.460
yes, you are.

37:17.810 --> 37:20.380
oh, I didn't expect this.

37:20.380 --> 37:23.500
I just thought it was a
bunch of stuff and. . .

37:24.800 --> 37:27.630
I’ve come completely undone.

37:28.320 --> 37:30.540
mom, you and dad were
married for over 40 years.

37:30.540 --> 37:33.370
that's a--that's a
whole life together.

37:33.370 --> 37:35.060
yeah.

37:35.630 --> 37:39.290
yeah, a whole life together.

37:39.290 --> 37:39.910
oh!

37:39.910 --> 37:41.370
I thought I was over it.

37:41.370 --> 37:43.530
I had mourned and accepted it.

37:43.530 --> 37:46.480
and then when I looked
up at the table, and. . .

37:47.430 --> 37:49.670
everything was gone. . .

37:51.940 --> 37:57.430
mom, there are--there are still some
times where I wanna drink or get high,

37:57.430 --> 38:01.460
and it sucks, because, you know,
just when I think I’m over it. . .

38:02.000 --> 38:03.570
I’m not.

38:03.570 --> 38:06.320
and sometimes, it just feels like hell,

38:06.860 --> 38:09.560
and I have to let myself feel that.

38:10.070 --> 38:12.630
but it does go away, mom.

38:14.980 --> 38:17.820
I wish he didn't get to me.

38:17.820 --> 38:20.940
I hate that he gets to me.

38:21.310 --> 38:23.430
come here.

38:25.250 --> 38:29.540
look, and one day, maybe
it won't hurt so much. . .

38:30.240 --> 38:32.450
and you can remember the good stuff.

38:32.450 --> 38:34.970
only the good stuff.

38:36.850 --> 38:38.110
good stuff.

38:38.110 --> 38:39.500
good stuff.

38:39.500 --> 38:41.050
you know what?

38:51.630 --> 38:53.000
now. . .

38:53.000 --> 38:55.610
not so empty in here.

38:57.620 --> 38:58.460
is that it?

38:58.460 --> 39:00.110
nope. wait.

39:00.110 --> 39:03.120
I thought the next generation
might want to get in on it.

39:03.120 --> 39:04.870
-oh, sweet.
-oh, my god.

39:04.870 --> 39:06.430
oh, that's a good idea.

39:06.430 --> 39:08.090
I’ve got a picture of
Elizabeth in my wallet.

39:08.090 --> 39:09.870
oh, cool.

39:12.840 --> 39:14.820
okay. let's seal her up.

39:16.840 --> 39:18.520
looks just like new. well done.

39:18.520 --> 39:21.030
well, I am the soil inspector, right?

39:22.900 --> 39:25.160
you, uh, you think the kids
will want to work there?

39:25.160 --> 39:26.620
what, at Ojai?

39:26.620 --> 39:29.030
do we really want to
inflict that on 'em?

39:29.030 --> 39:31.100
true.

39:33.640 --> 39:37.900
you know, I, uh, I did get over
dad bringing you into the company.

39:37.900 --> 39:43.330
after a while, it just felt
right, like when we were kids. . .

39:43.330 --> 39:45.820
even when we were fighting.

39:46.690 --> 39:49.420
it's just not the same with Holly.

39:50.730 --> 39:52.530
I’m sure you’ll get used to it.

39:52.530 --> 39:54.130
or, um. . .

39:54.130 --> 39:57.220
you and I could give it another shot.

39:57.710 --> 39:59.410
Holly won't be there forever.

39:59.410 --> 40:01.700
I’m not holding my breath.

40:04.220 --> 40:06.510
you never know.

40:15.760 --> 40:21.090
a 2-hour meeting on the
climate control of a warehouse.

40:21.090 --> 40:22.990
such glamorous work this is.

40:22.990 --> 40:25.240
when I walked by
earlier, it looked awful.

40:25.240 --> 40:27.440
that is an understatement.

40:27.440 --> 40:28.850
have you eaten lunch yet?

40:28.850 --> 40:30.690
uh, no, I haven't.

40:30.690 --> 40:33.380
I was thinking of going down
to the truck on the corner.

40:33.380 --> 40:36.630
best tacos this side of Tijuana.

40:37.180 --> 40:38.310
sure. good.

40:38.310 --> 40:42.290
well, I’m going to run this report on
ventilation down to accounting first.

40:42.290 --> 40:44.760
um, before you  go, I wanted to
start the overtime review, um,

40:44.760 --> 40:46.280
but I couldn't find the time cards.

40:46.280 --> 40:47.330
oh, I’m sorry. I pulled them.

40:47.330 --> 40:50.780
-they're right there, the manila folders.
-oh, awesome.
