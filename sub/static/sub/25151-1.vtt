Suspect is armed
and extremely dangerous.

00:13.137 --> 00:14.869
Snipers let me know
when you are in position.

00:14.871 --> 00:17.075
You have a shot, take it.

00:17.407 --> 00:20.475
This is the police.
We have you surrounded.

00:20.477 --> 00:22.479
Come out with your hands up.

00:25.316 --> 00:27.317
Release the hostages, Jimmy.

00:33.857 --> 00:37.061
Go kid.

00:43.534 --> 00:47.568
Release the
hostages, Jimmy! Do it now!

00:54.345 --> 00:56.310
No one has to die here tonight.

00:56.312 --> 00:57.913
Come on, man.

02:09.818 --> 02:11.720
Get out of the car.

02:36.247 --> 02:38.312
Ah!

02:38.314 --> 02:40.581
You motherfuckers, get
the hell off my property!

02:40.583 --> 02:42.617
Whoa, whoa. Are you
fucking kidding me, right now?

02:42.619 --> 02:43.786
Lorraine, he has an axe.

02:43.788 --> 02:47.256
Stan, Lorraine Taylor.
"Ghostly Night Watch."

02:47.258 --> 02:48.990
Yeah, we're the TV people.

02:48.992 --> 02:50.324
Oh, yeah.

02:50.326 --> 02:51.192
- Yeah.
- Hi, TV people.

02:51.194 --> 02:53.694
- Oh.
- Hi. Hey, may I?

02:53.696 --> 02:54.829
Great.

02:57.867 --> 03:01.870
Oh, okay. No offense, but
obviously this place is haunted.

03:01.872 --> 03:04.776
Case closed.

03:05.342 --> 03:07.442
Ew, wonder how
long that's been there.

03:07.444 --> 03:08.543
- Ew.
- Ah!

03:08.545 --> 03:09.543
What is it?

03:09.545 --> 03:11.513
- Ants.
- What?

03:11.515 --> 03:13.548
No, I'm terrified of ants.

03:13.550 --> 03:14.549
Ah!

03:14.551 --> 03:16.317
We heard screaming.

03:16.319 --> 03:17.519
Daniel saw an ant.

03:17.521 --> 03:22.591
Oh, well, everyone. This is
Stan. Stan bought this place

03:22.593 --> 03:26.664
in foreclosure after the
incident.

03:28.665 --> 03:31.299
I told you fools it
wasn't safe to be here today.

03:31.301 --> 03:34.735
Stan, Stan, we talked
about this. Yeah.

03:34.737 --> 03:37.972
I am so sorry. I
forgot my manners.

03:37.974 --> 03:41.676
This place, it just
gets me out of sorts.

03:41.678 --> 03:44.579
It's okay.

03:44.581 --> 03:51.419
This way. Brochures
are $2, by the way.

03:51.421 --> 03:53.754
Okay, you two, listen. I need
you to be super convincing.

03:53.756 --> 03:56.057
I need you get into
character, get in there and

03:56.059 --> 03:57.825
conduct a
proper interview. You got me?

03:57.827 --> 03:59.561
But I'm not a real
forensic detective.

03:59.563 --> 04:00.728
I don't know
how to interview.

04:00.730 --> 04:02.531
Yeah.
And I'm not really psychic, so-

04:02.533 --> 04:06.571
Oh, newsflash.
You're actors, so act.

04:13.476 --> 04:14.778
Yeah, yeah.

04:25.589 --> 04:35.433
Oh, Jimmy. Oh,
oh, oooh, oh, oh, oh.

04:36.433 --> 04:40.434
I can feel his
presence.Aah. Aah.

04:40.436 --> 04:43.672
This is not
being taken seriously.

04:43.674 --> 04:45.674
Shut the camera
off. I'm done.

04:45.676 --> 04:49.813
No, no, no. Stan, wait.
We are taking this very seriously.

04:50.813 --> 04:56.684
Sir, tell us about the alleged
incidents that you alleged

04:56.686 --> 05:00.857
to have happened
around the alleged property.

05:02.125 --> 05:06.895
I'll tell you this. Buying this
house was a big mistake.

05:06.897 --> 05:09.498
I mean,
I thought I'd make a fortune

05:09.500 --> 05:15.970
in murder tour tickets.
But no. One bad Yelp review,

05:15.972 --> 05:19.407
and that bus just stopped
coming. I can't even sleep

05:19.409 --> 05:24.979
here because he won't
let me. I actually had to move

05:24.981 --> 05:27.148
back into my mama's house.

05:27.150 --> 05:31.820
Tell me, have
you ever seen or witnessed

05:31.822 --> 05:34.756
this ghost of a serial killer?

05:34.758 --> 05:39.794
I'll tell what I have seen.
Shadows that shouldn't be there

05:39.796 --> 05:44.933
but are. Cold spots,
even in the summertime.

05:44.935 --> 05:48.503
Lights turning off
and on and shit.

05:48.505 --> 05:55.109
Jimmy, if you're here,
turn this light off right now.

05:55.111 --> 05:58.515
I command thee.

06:04.087 --> 06:07.655
Oh, victim Stan, what
about the horrific crime

06:07.657 --> 06:10.825
scene in the murder room.

06:10.827 --> 06:15.500
That's where he shot himself
exactly five years ago tonight.

06:16.834 --> 06:17.967
I won't go near it.

06:17.969 --> 06:22.573
He actually kept the bodies
in a closet over there.

06:24.875 --> 06:27.412
Little Mittens
won't go near it either.

06:28.010 --> 06:31.078
And he's the friendliest
cat you're ever gonna meet.

06:31.080 --> 06:33.215
Ah!

06:33.217 --> 06:37.018
Ah! The cat?

06:37.020 --> 06:39.220
That wasn't no damn cat.

06:39.222 --> 06:40.755
Take it easy, Stan.

06:40.757 --> 06:42.691
- What?
- Put it down.

06:42.693 --> 06:47.698
Y'all just don't get it, do
you? The spirit is evil!

06:48.231 --> 06:55.035
With a capital Evil! It wants to
cross over, and mark my words,

06:55.037 --> 06:59.708
he will do anything
to come through.

06:59.710 --> 07:04.044
Do not underestimate
Jimmy Timmy Beck.

07:09.620 --> 07:12.520
Uh, Jimmy Timmy?

07:12.522 --> 07:15.789
Don't start. We'll just shorten
his name for dramatic effect.

07:15.791 --> 07:19.796
So Jim Tim?

07:22.599 --> 07:24.669
Oh.

07:25.269 --> 07:26.934
Hey, Bob, it's me.

07:26.936 --> 07:28.169
Oh, Lorraine.

07:28.171 --> 07:30.871
I think I'm gonna buy this other
show. I was talking to Aisha-

07:30.873 --> 07:32.674
No, no, no.
You don't buy another show.

07:32.676 --> 07:34.643
This show is going to be
awesome, and you are going to

07:34.645 --> 07:36.645
want this, and you are not
going to buy anything from Aisha

07:36.647 --> 07:38.780
because she is a lying slutbag,
and I am going to deliver

07:38.782 --> 07:41.215
something
amazing to you in a week.

07:45.289 --> 07:47.155
No. Fine, fine.
I'll have a cut to you

07:47.157 --> 07:49.890
in 48 hours,
Bob, I promise. Bob.

07:53.063 --> 07:55.729
Two years ago I was up for an
Emmy and dating a Wahlberg.

07:55.731 --> 07:56.965
Do you have a check for me?

07:56.967 --> 07:59.900
Shit, Stan, you scared me!

07:59.902 --> 08:02.604
No. I don't have
a check for you today.

08:02.606 --> 08:04.773
No discretionary funds.

08:04.775 --> 08:06.073
What the hell
does that mean?

08:06.075 --> 08:10.712
It means you're an
associate producer now.

08:10.714 --> 08:12.013
Hmm, is that important?

08:12.015 --> 08:15.215
Oh, yeah.
All right.

08:15.217 --> 08:18.186
Okay.
So you just drive safe.

08:18.188 --> 08:21.592
We'll see you
in a couple days.

08:29.332 --> 08:31.232
Doesn't anybody
have a landline anymore?

08:31.234 --> 08:33.701
We're lucky this
place has working plumbing.

08:33.703 --> 08:35.003
So I thought that...

08:35.005 --> 08:36.937
So here's what we're gonna do.
I want you take this

08:36.938 --> 08:39.239
and I want you to go measure for
cold spots like those, um, those

08:39.241 --> 08:42.676
other ghost hunting shows do.
Yeah. Oh, if you find the guys

08:42.678 --> 08:45.015
cat, bonus. We use it as a prop.

08:58.160 --> 09:01.698
This place gives me the creeps.

09:42.805 --> 09:45.773
I know you said
you're not that observant.

09:45.775 --> 09:46.441
I saw that.

09:47.209 --> 09:50.011
Ah! Lorraine!

10:04.093 --> 10:06.363
- Oh! Oh, Jesus.
- Oh no.

10:06.763 --> 10:08.799
Oh.

10:10.766 --> 10:12.767
Oh, sweet hay bales,
there's the closet.

10:12.769 --> 10:16.307
Oh, number 12, Adele. Hello?

10:16.840 --> 10:18.072
Good idea.
We should pray.

10:18.074 --> 10:20.274
No, no, no. My acting coach told
me that I should count down my

10:20.276 --> 10:23.378
favorite songs every time I get
nervous, so I'm on number 11.

10:23.380 --> 10:24.845
Beyonce, "Crazy in Love."

10:24.847 --> 10:28.115
Oh.
"Back That Azz Up" by Juvenile.

10:30.786 --> 10:31.585
What's happening?

10:31.587 --> 10:33.455
Uh, uh, uh, he was here.

10:33.457 --> 10:34.922
He was
here and we saw him.

10:34.924 --> 10:35.923
Who was? Mittens?

10:35.925 --> 10:36.925
No, the ghost.

10:36.927 --> 10:39.194
Start recording and
get in the corner, okay?

10:39.196 --> 10:43.034
Hey, hey, follow me.
Measure for cold spots.

10:44.433 --> 10:47.768
Hey, hey,
measure for cold spots.

10:47.770 --> 10:50.341
Use your device.

10:54.144 --> 10:58.345
As I get closer to the closet,

10:58.347 --> 11:07.489
the temperature drops
because that is where Jimmy ate

11:07.491 --> 11:12.697
his victims.
Right, Sheryl?

11:13.829 --> 11:19.202
Um, the spirits are telling me
that's where they were digested.

11:19.870 --> 11:23.037
Now I'm going to try and
communicate with the spirit

11:23.039 --> 11:24.806
Jimmy Timmy Beck.

11:24.808 --> 11:25.941
Just Jimmy.

11:25.943 --> 11:29.811
Just Jimmy. Can you give
us a sign to show us you're

11:29.813 --> 11:31.345
here, Jimmy?

11:31.347 --> 11:36.187
We're not asking for much.
Just a sign, a real sign.

11:36.919 --> 11:40.924
Just dropped four degrees
cooler near the closet.

11:41.857 --> 11:44.392
Is that you, Jimmy?

11:44.394 --> 11:47.798
AH!

11:48.799 --> 11:50.064
Maybe that was the cat.

11:50.066 --> 11:53.337
That's a big fucking cat.

11:56.206 --> 11:58.306
Son of a bitch,
something bit me!

11:58.308 --> 12:00.141
Cut! You're fired.

12:00.143 --> 12:03.378
What? Because of a bug
bite? I'm calling my agent.

12:03.380 --> 12:04.513
Go call your agent.

12:04.515 --> 12:08.218
You're still fired. You suck.
Afraid of fucking bugs.

12:08.985 --> 12:11.018
I think I had a minor stroke.

12:11.020 --> 12:12.186
I think I wet myself.

12:12.188 --> 12:15.290
I'm gonna have a
long-term fear of closets.

12:15.292 --> 12:17.524
Hey, what's going on here?

12:17.526 --> 12:21.461
Did you hire an actor who looks
just like the real Jimmy Beck,

12:21.463 --> 12:24.298
and why was he
hiding in the closet?

12:24.300 --> 12:28.369
I hired a look alike. So what?
edit out the last five seconds

12:28.371 --> 12:31.505
and we have two TV hosts scared
shitless encountering the ghost

12:31.507 --> 12:34.075
of a crazed
serial killer. Winning.

12:34.077 --> 12:36.009
But he's not really a ghost.

12:36.011 --> 12:40.514
And you aren't really a psychic.
This is reality TV and we are

12:40.516 --> 12:43.383
creating the reality
TV that people want.

12:43.385 --> 12:47.257
Fuck, I have an
idea. Go get that idiot.

12:50.125 --> 12:53.927
You two have no idea
what is on the line here.

12:53.929 --> 12:57.364
If this works, I promise
you it is going to be life

12:57.366 --> 13:01.502
changing for all of us. I just
need you guys to run around for

13:01.504 --> 13:04.372
a couple hours, play
ghost hunters, look scared

13:04.374 --> 13:08.442
around every corner, and I
promise you I'm gonna make this

13:08.444 --> 13:13.648
worth your while. How's
a spa weekend on me sound?

13:13.650 --> 13:15.952
Very thoughtful and sweet.

13:16.919 --> 13:19.954
But unfortunately, I
can't accept that.

13:19.956 --> 13:22.556
Why? Guys do
spas all the time.

13:22.558 --> 13:25.659
Oh, it's not that. I'm just
super scared of steam.

13:25.661 --> 13:29.062
Oh, come on! Do you
know how many red carpets

13:29.064 --> 13:31.132
I have been to this year?

13:31.134 --> 13:34.034
None!
I need this.

13:34.036 --> 13:38.439
I want this. I can feel it.

13:38.441 --> 13:43.447
And if you aren't with
me, there's the door.

13:44.313 --> 13:48.383
Well, it's kind of far
back to town and I don't think

13:48.385 --> 13:55.322
you'll give me a ride, so yes,
for the spa weekend, I'll do it.

13:55.324 --> 13:57.358
Yeah. As long
as you don't scare me anymore.

13:57.360 --> 13:59.326
I am so proud
I cast you two.

13:59.328 --> 14:01.995
Find an actor? Find
my dick with your lips.

14:01.997 --> 14:04.965
Mom, can you come get me?
I... hello?

14:04.967 --> 14:07.301
Hello. Ah!

14:13.576 --> 14:16.347
Hmm.

14:17.347 --> 14:20.016
Huh.

14:21.284 --> 14:23.621
Dude's a ghost.

14:24.353 --> 14:26.421
Three bedroom,
two bath in the valley.

14:26.423 --> 14:29.257
Ah, kudos on the two
full baths in case you have

14:29.259 --> 14:30.691
a guest, you know?

14:30.693 --> 14:34.595
Oh ya. Oh, and the guy
from "One Tree Hill" is my neighor

14:34.597 --> 14:36.229
Ooh.

14:36.231 --> 14:39.167
You live next
to Jean Claude Van Damme?

14:39.169 --> 14:42.305
Did you sleep
with him yet?

14:43.305 --> 14:44.305
Sleep with who?

14:44.307 --> 14:46.139
Inappropriate, Pete.

14:46.141 --> 14:49.543
I was just asking. Anyway, no
idea where that actor dude went.

14:49.545 --> 14:51.446
Yeah, I'll deal with
him later. Get the camera on the

14:51.448 --> 14:53.413
closet door, and hurry!

14:53.415 --> 14:55.486
Huh!

14:56.385 --> 14:59.287
Whoa!

14:59.289 --> 15:00.989
Sorry, I missed it.

15:00.991 --> 15:03.992
Story of my life.

15:03.994 --> 15:05.560
You rigged the door.

15:05.562 --> 15:08.562
Of course. Do you think
they open on their own?

15:10.066 --> 15:11.532
Did you rig that too?

15:11.534 --> 15:14.538
No, I didn't.

15:16.438 --> 15:20.544
Hey, guys. Listen to this.

15:23.413 --> 15:25.178
This is my house.

15:25.180 --> 15:27.681
Holy bats in the belfry.

15:27.683 --> 15:31.051
That really happened.
There's really a ghost.

15:31.954 --> 15:33.553
Yeah, to being ghost hunters.

15:33.555 --> 15:35.690
Hmm, to being famous.

15:35.692 --> 15:39.560
You know what? It is time to put
the past behind us. To all the

15:39.562 --> 15:43.330
people that doubted me,
especially producers named Bob.

15:43.332 --> 15:46.200
That indie role I
probably didn't get.

15:46.202 --> 15:48.536
To my ex-girlfriend
Janet who left me in the church,

15:48.538 --> 15:50.071
and now she's a whore.

15:50.073 --> 15:51.739
Oh, no I'm sure she's not.

15:51.741 --> 15:54.341
No. She's a legit whore.

15:54.343 --> 15:57.277
Yeah. She barters
her vagina for cocaine.

15:57.279 --> 15:59.047
Oh.

15:59.049 --> 16:00.349
Okay.

16:00.351 --> 16:04.051
Uh, not really good at
this stuff, but, um, my dad got

16:04.053 --> 16:06.586
cancer last year and beat it.

16:06.588 --> 16:08.589
That's great.

16:08.591 --> 16:14.228
Then he died in a car accident,
which sucked. It was a stormy

16:14.230 --> 16:16.364
night, the road was
really windy, and the... the

16:16.366 --> 16:22.402
cliff kinda jumped out at him.
Plus he was hammered. But he was

16:22.404 --> 16:25.306
a really good drunk driver
normally. I was supposed to pick

16:25.308 --> 16:29.343
him up but, uh, I got
sidetracked on Tinder talking to

16:29.345 --> 16:32.647
this girl. I sent her a dick
pic, she sent me a dick pic

16:32.649 --> 16:36.651
back, which was really...
anyway. He sent me a text right

16:36.653 --> 16:37.551
before he disintegrated.

16:37.553 --> 16:42.125
He said,
"Son, I want you to know...

16:44.693 --> 16:47.030
my fucking car's on fire."

16:49.164 --> 16:50.630
I still have the text.

16:50.632 --> 16:54.337
Okay, then. Um,
let's get back to it.

16:55.138 --> 16:57.404
I'd like a camera
over there. You think you can

16:57.406 --> 16:58.806
handle that, Pete?

16:58.808 --> 17:00.240
Yeah.
Okay.

17:00.242 --> 17:02.278
Sure.

17:15.390 --> 17:18.192
Put a camera in all of
these trees, Pete? All the

17:18.194 --> 17:20.560
trees? Yeah, all
the trees, Pete,

17:20.563 --> 17:24.499
because I want
you to do all this extra work.

17:26.902 --> 17:29.640
Pete, time is money.

17:30.473 --> 17:34.175
This is for producers named
Bob that don't respect me and admire

17:34.177 --> 17:37.145
me like Pete does,
because who gives a fuck

17:37.147 --> 17:38.713
what Pete thinks.

17:38.715 --> 17:42.884
Oh, this is for that role I
didn't get because I didn't blow

17:42.886 --> 17:48.188
enough producers. Oh, this is
for my ex-girlfriend selling her

17:48.190 --> 17:51.260
twat for crack cocaine.

17:51.828 --> 17:53.293
I don't even like champagne.

17:53.295 --> 17:54.594
Peter!

17:54.596 --> 17:57.631
I'm putting
up the camera.

18:01.504 --> 18:03.204
Time is money!

18:03.206 --> 18:05.842
Yes, ma'am.

18:17.286 --> 18:19.587
You ever get the
feeling we're being watched?

18:19.589 --> 18:22.790
Stop complaining about stalkers.
At my age you're gonna

18:22.792 --> 18:24.891
want someone to follow you
home and watch you undress.

18:24.893 --> 18:27.895
No. I mean, like, right now.

18:27.897 --> 18:30.564
What?

18:30.566 --> 18:32.567
Ah!

18:32.569 --> 18:33.333
What was that?

18:33.335 --> 18:34.668
What the hell?

18:34.670 --> 18:36.305
What is that?

18:36.906 --> 18:38.505
Hey, guys.

18:38.507 --> 18:39.573
Found some beef jerky.

18:39.575 --> 18:42.211
Can you stop screwing
around and go get your camera?

18:43.713 --> 18:47.718
Okay. Time to check out the room
we're calling the death chamber.

18:51.454 --> 18:53.955
Okay. So you guys
remember what we rehearsed?

18:53.957 --> 18:57.861
Good, good. Pete,
are you rolling? And action.

18:58.494 --> 19:00.761
We're here on the
Beck property, haunted site

19:00.763 --> 19:05.265
of numerous grisly murders. As
you can see, it's very dark and

19:05.267 --> 19:08.002
I can feel
that evil is present.

19:08.004 --> 19:11.472
The killer buried
lots of bodies around

19:11.474 --> 19:15.676
this here Beck property. My
partner will use her psychic

19:15.678 --> 19:20.380
powers. I will use my forensic
science expertise. We will

19:20.382 --> 19:24.484
locate and conquer
this paranormal activity

19:24.486 --> 19:26.286
that we detect.

19:26.288 --> 19:27.754
Now,
the spirit has already shown

19:27.756 --> 19:29.357
some displeasure
with us being here,

19:29.359 --> 19:31.562
so we have
to be very careful.

19:34.997 --> 19:36.731
Okay. No one's gonna jump
out of here though, right?

19:36.733 --> 19:38.666
- No.
- No. We'll be fine.

20:05.027 --> 20:06.894
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

20:06.896 --> 20:09.566
Hmm.
Hmm.

20:10.632 --> 20:13.434
There seems to be a red
paint-like substance on the

20:13.436 --> 20:15.468
- Hmm.
- floor here.

20:16.339 --> 20:18.705
Ah. Yes, I think that's blood.

20:18.707 --> 20:21.542
Oh.
Ah, hmm.

20:21.544 --> 20:22.776
Oh.

20:25.948 --> 20:28.983
Hmm, well, that's strange.

20:28.985 --> 20:30.987
Hmm.

20:52.909 --> 20:55.743
Ew, ew, ew.

20:55.745 --> 20:58.678
We found the cat.

20:58.680 --> 20:59.613
Shut up.

20:59.615 --> 21:03.516
God, my top. Oh, I've
got cat blood on me.

21:03.518 --> 21:05.519
I can't get blood
exposure from this, can I?

21:05.521 --> 21:06.954
Like, cat hepatitis?

21:06.956 --> 21:08.421
- Awesome.
- How did it look?

21:08.423 --> 21:09.756
- Yeah.
- Swear?

21:09.758 --> 21:11.024
Mm, Let me see it.

21:11.026 --> 21:15.995
Blood, boobs, money shot.
Oh, my God.

21:15.997 --> 21:18.534
Was this you, Lorraine?

21:18.767 --> 21:20.501
Me?

21:20.503 --> 21:22.636
Yeah. You wanted
the cat as a prop.

21:22.638 --> 21:25.039
Judge Judy would
call that a motive, man.

21:25.041 --> 21:30.477
Okay. I donate to PETA, and
I am deathly allergic of cats.

21:30.479 --> 21:32.980
Hey, who turned
the house lights off?

21:38.720 --> 21:41.856
Uh, um-
LORRAINE: Let's get in there.

21:41.858 --> 21:44.425
Our psychic is
gonna call out that ghost.

21:44.427 --> 21:46.726
Wait, what? How
am I gonna do that?

21:46.728 --> 21:49.696
Positive energy. Let's do this.

21:49.698 --> 21:51.799
Uh, you should
really clean that shirt up.

21:55.470 --> 21:57.804
I bet you blood on
boobs attracts ghosts.

21:57.806 --> 21:59.139
Inappropriate, Pete!

21:59.141 --> 22:00.677
Sorry!

22:14.457 --> 22:18.626
Oh, I can't wait
to get this blood off.

22:18.628 --> 22:20.461
- Whoa.
- Oh, God.

22:20.463 --> 22:23.934
I don't remember my
20s being so perky.

22:27.469 --> 22:30.103
Got you some flashlights.
Holy tits!

22:30.105 --> 22:33.709
- Sorry. I was just, uh-
- Inappropriate, Pete.

22:38.980 --> 22:40.481
Here's some extra batteries.

22:40.483 --> 22:44.488
- Pete!
- That's a really nice rack.

22:56.966 --> 22:59.736
Hey!

23:00.469 --> 23:02.171
Somebody's been in here.

23:03.139 --> 23:06.443
That door was open when we left.

23:08.177 --> 23:09.709
Don't you bullshit me, Pete.

23:12.648 --> 23:16.750
Okay. This can't be good.
We should go back outside.

23:16.752 --> 23:19.219
No, this is great. Keep rolling.

23:22.557 --> 23:25.125
At least my timer still works.

23:25.127 --> 23:27.227
Your timer's not there.

23:27.229 --> 23:28.963
Oh.

23:28.965 --> 23:30.997
Something's fishy here.

23:30.999 --> 23:32.699
Like with the house.

23:32.701 --> 23:35.069
I don't trust her.

23:35.071 --> 23:37.871
Pete, you need to tell
us what she's up to.

23:37.873 --> 23:40.709
Me? How would I know?

23:41.910 --> 23:46.813
Look, even if it is her, she's
never gone this far before.

23:46.815 --> 23:49.250
Don't make me do it.

23:49.252 --> 23:50.885
What, are you guys like five?

23:54.689 --> 23:56.857
Actor guy?

23:56.859 --> 23:58.962
Who's in there?

23:59.794 --> 24:02.263
Keep rolling. We're going in.

24:02.265 --> 24:03.298
I'm not going in there.

24:03.300 --> 24:06.032
Don't you pull the
diva card with me, young lady.

24:06.034 --> 24:08.636
When I found you, you were Drunk
Sorority Chick Number 3 on an

24:08.638 --> 24:10.538
episode of "Scream Queens."

24:10.540 --> 24:12.606
For the record,
I was Drunk Girl Number 2.

24:12.608 --> 24:14.611
Whatever.

24:15.210 --> 24:16.776
You were on "Scream Queens"?

24:16.778 --> 24:18.781
Get in there now.

24:34.196 --> 24:38.767
Hello? Jimmy?

24:40.636 --> 24:43.603
Was that you we heard?

24:43.605 --> 24:47.340
If this was a horror film,
a cat would jump out right now.

24:47.342 --> 24:51.177
Pretty sure the cat's
jumping days are over.

24:51.179 --> 24:55.284
That's a good point,
Pete. Poor little Mittens.

24:56.953 --> 25:00.690
Jimmy, if that was you,
can you do that again?

25:03.092 --> 25:04.861
70 degrees even.

25:05.226 --> 25:09.765
Uh, uh.

25:32.787 --> 25:34.355
Still 70 degrees.

25:38.928 --> 25:42.966
Son of a bitch.

25:46.768 --> 25:48.804
It just went up a degree.

25:53.876 --> 25:58.044
What the fuck....
Holy fucking shit - Are you -

26:03.887 --> 26:05.852
Pete, you got
anymore batteries.

26:05.854 --> 26:08.022
Yeah. He's got
a lot of batteries.

26:08.024 --> 26:11.425
Um, yeah. They're Cs.

26:11.427 --> 26:14.128
- Oh.
- Oh, God.

26:14.130 --> 26:16.765
What do-these take Ds?

26:18.066 --> 26:19.602
I prefer Double Ds.

26:21.836 --> 26:23.640
I can't believe I'm in
the middle of this.

26:24.840 --> 26:26.842
I can't believe I'm in
the middle of this either.

26:27.776 --> 26:29.778
I want to go home.

26:31.080 --> 26:35.251
It's gonna be okay, buddy.
It's gonna be okay.

26:37.852 --> 26:39.221
See?

26:40.055 --> 26:42.089
Anything?

26:42.091 --> 26:45.792
Instant temperature drop.
Back in business.

26:47.996 --> 26:49.698
Uh, actually...

26:50.800 --> 26:53.970
Oh. I think we just
debunked our cold spots.

26:58.107 --> 27:01.978
Where's Lorraine.

27:04.313 --> 27:06.980
Looks like there's our answer.

27:06.982 --> 27:11.187
Debunked our light problem.
It's our producer, Lorraine.

27:11.486 --> 27:15.958
That's two for two.
Come on out, Lorraine.

27:16.358 --> 27:17.491
I don't think this is Lorraine.

27:17.493 --> 27:21.331
My inner voice is telling
me this is definitely her.

27:22.331 --> 27:23.464
You know what we should do?

27:23.466 --> 27:26.233
Call Judge Judy right now.

27:26.235 --> 27:29.903
No. We should scare her.

27:29.905 --> 27:32.106
I don't think that's
possible. One time

27:32.108 --> 27:33.773
I saw her get
bit by a rattlesnake.

27:33.775 --> 27:35.743
She sucked out the poison,
killed the snake, and then made

27:35.745 --> 27:39.513
me a belt. She's like
Chuck Norris, just way sexier.

27:39.515 --> 27:42.416
Okay. Well, look. If she wants
to mess around with dead cats

27:42.418 --> 27:46.119
and all this sick shit, I say
we give it right back to her.

27:46.121 --> 27:48.421
Like the Ten
Commandments. When people do

27:48.423 --> 27:50.823
stuff to you, you gotta
do stuff back to people.

27:50.825 --> 27:54.994
Exactly. If she wants to
keep scaring us, guess what?

27:54.996 --> 27:58.000
Two people
can play at that game.

27:59.901 --> 28:03.771
Maybe we should
hide or something.

28:03.773 --> 28:05.138
I'm not hiding.
I'm a grownup.

28:05.140 --> 28:07.107
She's hiding and she's
got a three-bedroom house in the

28:07.109 --> 28:09.345
- valley.
- Had a house.

28:10.211 --> 28:11.311
What?

28:11.313 --> 28:13.981
She had a House. She sold
it to pay for this show.

28:13.983 --> 28:16.550
Now she lives above a
methadone clinic a mile from

28:16.552 --> 28:18.151
me in Van Nuys

28:18.153 --> 28:20.853
Oh, she's such a liar.

28:20.855 --> 28:22.889
She's a Class A
sinner, that one.

28:22.891 --> 28:25.894
Oh, she's got a good heart
and she's just, uh...

28:26.461 --> 28:30.531
buries it deep,
really, really deep.

28:30.533 --> 28:32.800
Mm, you so
have a crush on her.

28:32.802 --> 28:35.869
Oh, no.
No, I...

28:35.871 --> 28:38.839
Whatever. She's just using you.
I think she likes chicks.

28:38.841 --> 28:39.872
No, she doesn't!

28:44.112 --> 28:45.878
Can we please just
find her and prove that she

28:45.880 --> 28:47.915
is behind all of this? Because
if not, I am going to be

28:47.917 --> 28:49.382
convinced that there
is a ghost under my bed

28:49.384 --> 28:50.417
the rest of my life.

28:50.419 --> 28:51.686
Okay. We'll be those
meddling kids from "Dukes

28:51.688 --> 28:55.555
of Hazzard." You can be Bo, you
can be Luke, and I'll be Daisy.

28:55.557 --> 28:58.926
Uh, meddling kids was
"Scooby Doo," and that was Daphne.

28:58.928 --> 29:01.360
Yeah. I don't want to be
the racist people from that show

29:01.362 --> 29:03.263
that got canceled
for being racist.

29:03.265 --> 29:04.363
They weren't racist.

29:04.365 --> 29:06.032
Says the white guy.

29:06.034 --> 29:07.234
I'm half Portuguese.

29:07.236 --> 29:09.269
Okay. So is she
Daphne or is she Daisy?

29:09.271 --> 29:09.969
I'm so confused.

29:09.971 --> 29:11.237
Can we just find the fuse box?

29:11.239 --> 29:13.543
Yes. Maybe in there.

29:17.580 --> 29:20.516
Hey!
Hey!

29:37.131 --> 29:39.398
I bet it's in the garage.

29:39.400 --> 29:41.568
- More blood.
- Ooh.

29:41.570 --> 29:43.503
That is blood, right, Pete?

29:43.505 --> 29:44.603
Oh, yeah.

29:44.605 --> 29:48.542
Oh, Lorraine. I just got
over the last dead animal.

29:48.544 --> 29:50.878
I'm not going in there,
guys. You don't understand.

29:50.880 --> 29:53.246
I have an extreme
phobia of being murdered.

29:53.248 --> 29:56.885
That's not a phobia. Everybody's
afraid of being murdered.

29:57.887 --> 29:59.919
Well, I don't care. I'm
gonna go outside and

29:59.921 --> 30:01.021
wait for Lorraine.

30:05.960 --> 30:09.966
Mm.

30:10.966 --> 30:12.968
Nice boots.

30:13.268 --> 30:17.036
Thank you.

30:43.399 --> 30:44.697
Get the champagne, Pete.

30:44.699 --> 30:46.966
- Wait a second.
- What?

30:46.968 --> 30:50.974
Look.

30:54.709 --> 30:58.578
This car is a 2012. You can tell
right by the steering wheel.

30:58.580 --> 31:01.113
She always told
me it was brand new.

31:01.115 --> 31:04.386
Huh. Time to drink.

31:31.013 --> 31:34.281
Sea salt filtered
through holy water, blessed by

31:34.283 --> 31:36.550
a Catholic Bishop.

31:36.552 --> 31:41.390
One spirit-detecting candle made
by a Native American shaman.

31:42.358 --> 31:47.226
I'm sorry, but today
being the very anniversary of

31:47.228 --> 31:51.465
Jimmy's suicide, it's the
only day that I can do this...

31:51.467 --> 31:54.400
Do what?

31:54.402 --> 31:57.236
Gut that son of a bitch

31:57.238 --> 32:01.108
who murdered my
brother when I was in prison.

32:01.110 --> 32:04.680
I don't
follow you. I really don't ...ah.

32:07.682 --> 32:14.286
Jimmy Timmy Beck. I can
barely say that asshole's name.

32:14.288 --> 32:15.755
It's easier if
you drop the Timmy.

32:19.628 --> 32:25.599
You know I'm here for
you, Jimmy. You see, I was doing

32:25.601 --> 32:29.235
a bid in McDougal for armed
robbery when he snatched my

32:29.237 --> 32:35.074
brother like he did the others.
He brought him here to this very

32:35.076 --> 32:40.082
place and he did things to him.

32:40.448 --> 32:44.317
I used to love the bacon
cheeseburgers at Sully's.

32:44.319 --> 32:45.484
They're delicious.

32:45.486 --> 32:49.089
They come with these fries,
baked beans, and coleslaw.

32:49.091 --> 32:53.627
Then they went out of business
so I started going to Twain's.

32:53.629 --> 32:57.664
They had this
amazing French dip.

32:57.666 --> 32:58.799
The portions
were kinda small,

32:58.801 --> 33:04.006
but it was worth
it for the price.

33:05.373 --> 33:10.077
You know, in this
light you look just like him.

33:10.079 --> 33:11.645
Are you kidding me?

33:11.647 --> 33:13.346
Yeah.

33:13.348 --> 33:17.349
Unh-unh. Unh-unh. Unh-unh.

33:17.351 --> 33:19.418
Ugh.

33:19.420 --> 33:21.620
Got used to going there
and then, of course, they went

33:21.622 --> 33:28.128
out of business too. So I
started going to, uh, Du-Par's.

33:28.130 --> 33:30.163
They had a really good,
uh, beet salad that I liked.

33:31.400 --> 33:34.367
How sad is that?

33:34.369 --> 33:37.540
She's still at it.

33:38.540 --> 33:41.577
Wait a minute. Look at that.

33:42.578 --> 33:44.711
Who's that guy?

33:44.713 --> 33:46.378
I don't know.
Maybe that asshole Bob from

33:46.380 --> 33:50.085
the network she's
always talking about.

33:50.886 --> 33:52.785
He's probably in there
commending her on her

33:52.787 --> 33:58.226
work ethic. Man, she's got a
real commitment to this show.

33:58.861 --> 34:06.069
Wait. But if she's in there,
who's messing with the fuse box?

34:12.306 --> 34:20.213
Tonight, Jimmy Beck's
soul has the power to cross over

34:20.215 --> 34:25.818
into another living body at the
exact moment of his death five

34:25.820 --> 34:33.292
years ago
today at precisely 6:66 p.m.

34:33.293 --> 34:35.360
That's 7:06, you fucktard.

34:35.362 --> 34:38.297
And with the
proper incantation, his body can

34:38.300 --> 34:43.335
enter our realm for exactly one
hour. How do I know this, do you

34:43.338 --> 34:47.206
ask? Well, I happen to meet a
French Quarter voodoo priest

34:47.208 --> 34:50.510
online who gave me the exact
invocation for this very ritual

34:50.512 --> 34:55.313
here. Yeah. Uh, I am totally
rocking this whole spiritual

34:55.315 --> 35:01.720
diversity thing. Some of
this shit's gotta work, right?

35:01.722 --> 35:02.955
What about the blood?

35:02.957 --> 35:04.925
We gotta find out what's
controlling these lights?

35:04.927 --> 35:06.593
At this point,
I don't care if that blood's

35:06.595 --> 35:08.394
from a
dismembered Labradoodle.

35:08.396 --> 35:09.762
What's a Labradoodle?

35:09.764 --> 35:11.631
It's like when a
Labrador mates a Poodle,

35:11.633 --> 35:12.765
or a Poodle
mates a Labrador.

35:12.767 --> 35:13.633
Mm-hmm.

35:13.635 --> 35:15.568
I can't remember
who has to be on top.

35:15.570 --> 35:16.803
You know this

35:16.805 --> 35:20.506
whole abbreviated serial killer
thing has not been easy on me,

35:20.508 --> 35:23.510
you know? Uh, I'm a nice guy,
but I had to walk in his shoes

35:23.512 --> 35:27.914
to get in the right frame of
mind. First, I did the cat. I

35:27.916 --> 35:29.582
fucking hate cats. Second,

35:29.584 --> 35:34.854
I did that whiny little actor
friend of yours. Uh, third,

35:34.856 --> 35:37.524
I fucking raped
the shit out of his goat.

35:37.526 --> 35:42.262
Oh, fuck me. And
last, last but not least,

35:42.264 --> 35:43.863
I'm gonna be killing you.

35:43.865 --> 35:44.898
Me?

35:44.900 --> 35:46.033
Yeah. Uh, you see

35:46.035 --> 35:49.336
um, I want his spirit to
enter a living body so I can

35:49.338 --> 35:52.872
torment him like he did my
brother. Yeah. I'm gonna slice

35:52.874 --> 35:56.443
him. I'm gonna slice him from
his throat all the way down to

35:56.445 --> 36:00.981
his taint. I am gonna watch the
life leave his eyes just like he

36:00.983 --> 36:04.383
did my brother.
He didn't deserve what he got.

36:04.385 --> 36:07.387
He wasn't
even a tranny.

36:07.389 --> 36:08.787
You lost me.

36:08.789 --> 36:11.490
Jimmy Timmy Beck
only killed transvestite midget

36:11.492 --> 36:13.526
circus clowns.
You did not know this?

36:13.528 --> 36:16.463
I'm shocked. Yeah.
The fucking papers kept it quiet

36:16.465 --> 36:18.765
because they didn't want to
discourage the fucking precious

36:18.767 --> 36:21.401
carnival from coming in every
year, but, you know, still. I

36:21.403 --> 36:25.372
don't know why he picked my
brother. He wasn't even a midget

36:25.374 --> 36:26.939
or a fucking clown
for that matter.

36:26.941 --> 36:28.841
Okay. Let me get
this straight for one second.

36:28.843 --> 36:31.577
You're gonna get a
murderer's spirit to enter my

36:31.579 --> 36:34.814
body for one hour;
is that correct?

36:34.816 --> 36:35.914
Yeah,
that's correct.

36:35.916 --> 36:38.684
Okay. And then you're
gonna kill me, but you actually

36:38.686 --> 36:40.586
think that you're killing the
murderer's spirit that is in

36:40.588 --> 36:43.289
my body; am I correct again?

36:43.291 --> 36:44.158
Correct.

36:44.160 --> 36:47.459
Okay. So
listen to me. Why wouldn't you

36:47.461 --> 36:50.497
have used, I don't know, let's
say maybe the actor who looked

36:50.499 --> 36:52.064
exactly like the
murderer's spirit?

36:52.066 --> 36:54.566
I'm not having sex with a guy.

36:54.568 --> 36:57.836
What the fuck? You
didn't say anything about sex.

36:57.838 --> 37:01.341
Is this supposed to before or
after you're gonna kill me?

37:01.343 --> 37:02.475
Correct.

37:02.477 --> 37:04.878
What? Oh, no. This has to
be some sick fucking joke.

37:04.880 --> 37:09.619
Shh.

37:13.622 --> 37:15.957
Well, I guess that
rules out a Labradoodle.

37:21.396 --> 37:24.863
Revenge is hard to explain,
it really is, okay?

37:24.865 --> 37:27.966
It will be him,
but it will be you, you know I

37:27.968 --> 37:31.070
mean, I have spent the last six
years in a men's prison, and...

37:31.072 --> 37:35.441
and, and a woman with all of her
working lady parts, it'll be a

37:35.443 --> 37:36.876
nice change for me.
I'm looking forward to it.

37:36.878 --> 37:39.044
You fucking psychopath.

37:39.046 --> 37:42.381
His body cannot enter
this circle here. I will be

37:42.383 --> 37:47.921
protected, and you on the other
side, you're gonna die. Okay.

37:47.923 --> 37:53.626
Uh, this is Viagra for my penis.

37:59.968 --> 38:01.901
That's the worst
bug bite I've ever seen.

38:01.903 --> 38:03.903
Mm-hmm.

38:03.905 --> 38:05.939
Poor little actor guy.

38:05.941 --> 38:08.908
Is he really, you know?

38:08.910 --> 38:13.879
Dead? Either that or he's
a really good actor.

38:13.881 --> 38:14.948
Check his pulse.

38:27.896 --> 38:29.662
I don't
feel anything.

38:29.664 --> 38:36.503
That's not where
his pulse is. It's over here.

38:36.505 --> 38:38.407
Or maybe over here.

38:41.410 --> 38:44.042
Find it?

38:44.044 --> 38:45.945
This dude is dead.

38:58.427 --> 39:00.059
Hmm.

39:00.061 --> 39:01.593
Maybe now he's dead.

39:06.168 --> 39:07.233
Uh...

39:07.235 --> 39:10.637
Shit. Lorraine might
really be in trouble in there.

39:10.639 --> 39:11.637
Then we should run away, guys.

39:11.639 --> 39:15.543
We should run far away
right now. And get help.

39:21.849 --> 39:24.853
Come on, Pete.

39:27.856 --> 39:32.495
Come for me, Jimmy Timmy.

39:33.494 --> 39:37.696
Come for me, Jimmy Timmy Beck.

39:37.698 --> 39:41.468
Enter this physical
vessel which I have

39:41.470 --> 39:44.140
provided for you.

39:49.510 --> 39:51.010
Welcome.

39:52.881 --> 39:55.582
Whoo! Aah!

39:55.584 --> 39:57.950
Beat me with a broom stick.

39:57.952 --> 40:01.423
You have ruined my circle.

40:01.923 --> 40:02.955
Get away.

40:02.957 --> 40:04.256
Unh-unh.

40:04.258 --> 40:07.526
Oh. Oh, hey

40:07.528 --> 40:11.534
Pete, could you, like, man up
here and do something, please?

40:14.202 --> 40:15.200
Shit.

40:15.202 --> 40:17.236
Technically that was something.

40:17.238 --> 40:19.071
He's like a ninja.

40:19.073 --> 40:25.077
You have ruined my fucking
ritual. The spirit needs a body.

40:34.256 --> 40:36.789
Oh, hey, we gotta go. We
gotta get to the car. Hurry up.

40:36.791 --> 40:38.258
No, no, no. The car doesn't
work. He ripped...

40:38.260 --> 40:39.091
he ripped the wires out.

40:39.093 --> 40:40.526
What the hell is going on?

40:40.528 --> 40:41.794
We have to get out now.

40:41.796 --> 40:43.195
You're kind
of dodging the question.

40:43.197 --> 40:46.201
No, I'm dodging him!

40:49.303 --> 40:54.606
Get over here! Ah!

40:58.847 --> 41:01.713
Ah, ah, ah, sir, sir.

41:01.715 --> 41:02.582
Seriously, man,
just take a pill.

41:02.584 --> 41:04.617
No, no! No
more pills. No more pills.

41:04.619 --> 41:10.657
Which one of you pieces of
shit murdered my brother? Hmm?

41:10.659 --> 41:12.191
None of us!
None of us, sir. We don't know

41:12.193 --> 41:13.258
what you're talking about.

41:13.260 --> 41:14.526
Jimmy Beck. He's trying

41:14.528 --> 41:16.963
to raise the spirit for an hour
of sadomasochism and mutilation.

41:16.965 --> 41:20.198
I want revenge on that
motherfucker for what he did to

41:20.200 --> 41:26.738
my brother Dale. He doesn't seem
to be in any one of you though.

41:26.740 --> 41:28.975
Well, you don't see us lining
up for Ringling Brothers Circus,

41:28.977 --> 41:29.975
do you?

41:29.977 --> 41:31.311
What?

41:31.313 --> 41:32.812
Oh, yeah. Jimmy's
victims were all cross-dressing

41:32.814 --> 41:34.280
circus clowns under 5'7".

41:34.282 --> 41:35.747
He killed poor little munchkins.

41:35.749 --> 41:39.885
His spirit
is out. I can feel it.

41:39.887 --> 41:42.220
But why didn't it
enter a body, hmm?

41:42.222 --> 41:44.356
Sir, sir, we
don't know, okay?

41:44.358 --> 41:47.961
Back. Hey, hey, do me a favor.
Just... just put down the knife.

41:47.963 --> 41:50.696
Give... give Pete the knife.

41:50.698 --> 41:51.932
Actually
Sheryl's closer.

41:51.934 --> 41:55.133
Hand Pete the knife. Hand Pete
the knife. Hand Pete the knife.

41:55.135 --> 41:56.336
Yeah.
Hand Pete the knife.

41:56.338 --> 41:58.236
Yeah. Aah!

41:58.238 --> 42:00.606
The body, it has
no choice but to enter

42:00.608 --> 42:03.008
another one for one hour.

42:04.111 --> 42:08.213
It's not supposed to go. Fucking
Jimmy Timmy! Just...

42:11.919 --> 42:14.921
What the fuck are you doing?
Get back! Stay back! Stay back!

42:14.923 --> 42:16.289
Fuck why didn't it work?

42:16.291 --> 42:20.126
Oh, Shit! Maybe I
got this all wrong.

42:20.128 --> 42:22.128
Maybe I got it all wrong.

42:23.331 --> 42:26.633
I've done everything! I was
waiting a year for this shit!

42:26.635 --> 42:30.836
Maybe the spirit can't
cross over into a living body.

42:30.838 --> 42:33.039
Maybe it's gotta
be fucking dead.

42:33.041 --> 42:37.709
Oh, fuck...

42:37.711 --> 42:40.847
Oh, I have been
waiting for this!

42:46.086 --> 42:48.187
Run! Hey, Mr. Dead
Guy! Hey, hey, hey,

42:48.189 --> 42:52.194
Mr. Dead Guy! Get his knife!
Get his knife! Ahh!

42:53.394 --> 42:54.593
I'm the one who does the gutting

42:54.595 --> 43:02.267
around here, Emmett. And I'm
gonna do you just like I did

43:02.269 --> 43:10.276
your whiny little brother
while he begged and begged,

43:10.278 --> 43:15.280
Just the tip,
Jimmy. Just the tip.

43:21.289 --> 43:23.856
Oh, well, that
was a bit extreme.

43:25.260 --> 43:28.093
What's with the whole
last dying breath thing?

43:28.095 --> 43:30.162
Ah!

43:30.164 --> 43:33.365
Who's next? You?

43:33.367 --> 43:35.734
Me?

43:35.736 --> 43:37.370
But you look like
the "cut my cock off and

43:37.372 --> 43:39.171
grow a pair of tits type.

43:39.173 --> 43:40.907
N... No, I don't.

43:40.909 --> 43:46.745
Yeah, you do. You've got enough
whore makeup on to be a clown.

43:46.747 --> 43:49.782
Hah, I just use
a little bronzer, that's it.

43:49.784 --> 43:56.289
Hmm. And you're
just a lying little bitch.

43:56.291 --> 44:00.492
- Touché.
- Heh.

44:11.905 --> 44:19.010
It isn't going to start!
Keep going!

44:19.012 --> 44:21.213
In hindsight, this
probably wasn't a great idea.

44:21.215 --> 44:24.883
Ugh, Taking this gig?
Tell me about it.

44:24.885 --> 44:26.519
God dammit, we're off the grid.

44:26.521 --> 44:28.954
Can't even check Facebook.

44:28.956 --> 44:31.157
Do you remember
how far we are from town?

44:31.159 --> 44:34.093
Like, what
five miles? I don't remember.

44:34.095 --> 44:41.434
We are not going out
there. Hello? Stranger danger.

44:41.436 --> 44:44.269
That's a good point.
Probably a lot more

44:44.271 --> 44:47.173
dangerous out there than
in here with a possessed killer.

44:47.175 --> 44:49.841
The devil you know, right?

44:49.843 --> 44:52.278
Hey, maybe he
can't leave the house.

44:59.988 --> 45:03.321
These boots weren't
meant for running, Pete.

45:03.323 --> 45:05.825
Okay. I think
I have an idea.

45:05.827 --> 45:07.292
Okay.

45:07.294 --> 45:11.263
So the evil spirit in that
dead body has an hour time limit,

45:11.265 --> 45:12.999
so the clock is ticking.

45:13.001 --> 45:14.934
I kind of missed
the whole origin story.

45:14.936 --> 45:20.173
Just listen. All we have to do
is hunker down and wait it out.

45:20.175 --> 45:24.510
That makes sense. Actually,
none of that makes sense.

45:24.512 --> 45:28.213
Okay. So here's the plan. I'm
gonna go hide in the dead cat

45:28.215 --> 45:30.283
shed over there and
you're gonna go get the camera.

45:30.285 --> 45:34.053
phew, no. no. no, that... what?

45:34.055 --> 45:36.122
Someone's gotta film this, Pete.

45:36.124 --> 45:38.825
I mean, this is like the "Blair
Witch Project" times twenty.

45:38.827 --> 45:41.294
I mean, think about the money
and the job security, Pete.

45:41.296 --> 45:42.961
I'm thinking about not
getting raped in the

45:42.963 --> 45:44.896
ass and murdered by
that thing back there.

45:44.898 --> 45:48.300
I mean, we could probably
get another job somewhere.

45:48.302 --> 45:51.604
I don't see him. Maybe he
followed Lorraine and Pete.

45:55.977 --> 45:59.044
I held my breath
for a full minute that time.

45:59.046 --> 46:04.350
Whew. That is not
bad for someone with asthma.

46:04.352 --> 46:06.919
Oh, God, I don't believe this.

46:06.921 --> 46:09.155
Huh, What?

46:09.157 --> 46:10.923
Ugh, I just had a thought.

46:10.925 --> 46:13.392
Lorraine said she'd give me
that free spa weekend, right?

46:13.394 --> 46:14.593
Mm-hmm.

46:14.595 --> 46:15.827
But this new situation, does it
change that? I mean, what

46:15.829 --> 46:18.898
what if something happens to
her? Do I still get the weekend?

46:18.900 --> 46:19.765
It was a verbal agreement.

46:19.767 --> 46:22.468
Hmm, great. So I'm
gonna get screwed.

46:22.470 --> 46:25.004
She better live,
that's all I have to say.

46:25.006 --> 46:27.006
No. No, no, no, no.
Judge Judy would say that

46:27.008 --> 46:29.441
it's legally binding. She...

46:29.443 --> 46:31.376
she'd rule in your
favor on that one.

46:36.550 --> 46:37.649
Please tell me that was you.

46:37.651 --> 46:40.051
Unh-unh.

47:09.617 --> 47:11.117
Hold still.

47:11.119 --> 47:12.318
I am holding still.

47:14.055 --> 47:18.124
The goat's over there.
I don't want him to attack us.

47:18.126 --> 47:20.126
Why would the goat attack us?

47:20.128 --> 47:22.260
Wouldn't you be pissed off if
you were fucked in the ass by

47:22.262 --> 47:23.428
a crazy psycho killer?

47:27.235 --> 47:29.535
I ain't afraid of
no goats. Let's go.

47:39.680 --> 47:41.414
I think we lost him.

47:41.416 --> 47:46.051
Okay. What do we know about
this Jimmy Beck ghost guy?

47:46.053 --> 47:48.153
He was probably
bullied a lot as a child,

47:48.155 --> 47:50.356
maybe even some
as a ghost. I don't know.

47:50.358 --> 47:51.590
I bet no one
went to his funeral

47:51.592 --> 47:53.392
and that hurt
his feelings and... and

47:53.394 --> 47:55.227
caused him to become even
more of a sicko freakish

47:55.229 --> 47:56.195
psychotic killing machine.

47:56.197 --> 47:58.564
No. I mean, why
would he want to hurt us?

47:58.566 --> 48:00.432
We're not
his style. Think about it.

48:00.434 --> 48:03.369
His issues are
tranny clown midgets.

48:03.371 --> 48:05.403
You have to say
transgender little people.

48:05.405 --> 48:07.573
Do you think Daniel
and Sheryl are ok?

48:07.575 --> 48:09.541
Ah, the universe
protects idiots, Pete.

48:09.543 --> 48:11.209
I would've cast the girl from
the condom commercial,

48:11.211 --> 48:14.113
but she didn't
fucking call me back.

48:14.115 --> 48:16.314
Uh, Lor... Lorraine?

48:16.316 --> 48:18.084
I could get a
film deal from this.

48:18.086 --> 48:20.086
Even better, I could
get a book deal from this.

48:20.088 --> 48:21.687
I mean, this could probably
put me back on the map.

48:21.689 --> 48:23.321
Lorraine?

48:23.323 --> 48:30.463
What?
Where's the cat?

48:41.441 --> 48:46.211
Listen to me. We're
not his demographic.

48:46.213 --> 48:49.217
You're right.
That's profiling 101.

48:51.552 --> 48:53.555
I should've known that.

48:54.389 --> 48:56.390
Mm.

49:02.630 --> 49:05.497
This guy's breaking all
the serial killer rules, Sheryl.

49:05.499 --> 49:07.666
Do you want to stick
around and tell him, Daniel?

49:07.668 --> 49:09.135
Ahh!

49:09.137 --> 49:10.436
Oh, ahh.

49:10.438 --> 49:12.238
Okay, girl. Get it together.

49:12.240 --> 49:14.372
You can do this.
You take pilates twice a week.

49:14.374 --> 49:16.441
You are Lorraine Taylor.
You're gonna have a

49:16.443 --> 49:17.510
major book deal from this.

49:19.280 --> 49:20.445
Peter?

49:22.316 --> 49:25.050
Huh!, Fucking zombie cat.

49:27.421 --> 49:29.789
This is why I'm a dog person.

49:37.764 --> 49:39.532
Hey! Ow!

49:39.534 --> 49:43.135
Oh, Peter, thank God.
I didn't know where you were.

49:43.137 --> 49:44.236
You were worried about me?

49:44.238 --> 49:47.740
You have the flashlight.
I think I lost an earring.

49:47.742 --> 49:49.175
Of course.

49:49.177 --> 49:51.077
Thank you.

49:51.079 --> 49:52.077
Where's
Lorraine?

49:52.079 --> 49:53.079
God!

49:53.081 --> 49:54.479
Oh!
Thank God!

49:54.481 --> 49:54.981
Ah!

49:54.983 --> 49:56.682
Hey! Oh, it's me.

49:56.684 --> 49:58.316
Okay. Okay.

49:58.318 --> 50:01.387
Hey, that label said
"Willard," not "Prada."

50:01.389 --> 50:03.088
So?

50:03.090 --> 50:04.657
The boots are knock offs?

50:04.659 --> 50:05.725
So what?

50:05.727 --> 50:07.792
Judge Judy would call
that copyright infringement.

50:07.794 --> 50:10.195
Well, fuck Judge Judy and fuck
you too, Daniel. And you know

50:10.197 --> 50:13.698
what? Fuck you, fuck you, and
fuck this fucking ghost. I don't

50:13.700 --> 50:16.434
need approval from any of
you people. Do you think you're

50:16.436 --> 50:19.437
always gonna be in your 20s? Let
me tell you a little story about

50:19.439 --> 50:20.539
me when I was 20.

50:20.541 --> 50:22.541
Not the youth
squandered speech again.

50:22.543 --> 50:24.843
We get it. You've had
to compromise. You've made

50:24.845 --> 50:27.680
mistakes, which leads us to your
biggest one, the lookalike actor

50:27.682 --> 50:30.282
you hired who now has a crazed
ghost killer inside of him and

50:30.284 --> 50:33.285
is currently chasing after us
with a knife trying to kill us.

50:33.287 --> 50:37.455
So we're going to suck it up and
go hide in the dead cat shed.

50:37.457 --> 50:39.191
By the way, the
cat's not dead.

50:39.193 --> 50:40.593
Little Mittens
is alive and well?

50:40.595 --> 50:41.461
Not really.

50:41.463 --> 50:45.597
Yeah, he's undead,
like Jimmy. Hell,

50:45.599 --> 50:47.533
everything around here seems
susceptible to being raised from

50:47.535 --> 50:50.702
the dead after whatever black
magic that douchebag screwed up.

50:50.704 --> 50:52.637
But if everything
can be raised...

50:52.639 --> 50:55.173
That means not only the cat,

50:55.175 --> 50:56.876
but those midget
clowns he killed too.

51:00.180 --> 51:03.182
Still, Why would
they want to hurt us?

51:03.184 --> 51:04.082
Yeah.

51:04.084 --> 51:05.783
They... we didn't
do anything to them.

51:05.785 --> 51:07.253
Ow!

51:07.255 --> 51:09.622
Is anything here rational?

51:09.624 --> 51:10.722
Ow!

51:10.724 --> 51:11.923
Hey

51:11.925 --> 51:15.294
Hey, you cocksucking clowns,
stop throwing rocks right now!

51:15.296 --> 51:18.229
Ow! Oww!!

51:18.231 --> 51:19.465
Jesus!

51:40.720 --> 51:42.220
I so hate this house.

52:33.640 --> 52:37.945
Leaking all
over my damn house.

52:42.950 --> 52:49.454
I held my breath another minute.

52:49.456 --> 52:51.490
It seems to be my ceiling.

52:51.492 --> 52:53.658
Number 10, Wilson Phillips,
"Hold On."

52:53.660 --> 52:57.896
Number nine, Kelly Clarkson,
"Since You Been Gone."

52:57.898 --> 52:59.631
Shh.

52:59.633 --> 53:03.602
I'm sorry. I'm just really
nervous, and I have to pee.

53:03.604 --> 53:04.937
I really do.

53:04.939 --> 53:07.939
So do I. We
should've hit the bathroom.

53:07.941 --> 53:09.975
I know. There's three
of them in here and we can't use

53:09.977 --> 53:13.012
any of them right now.
One of my worst fears actually.

53:55.689 --> 53:58.890
Do you think he left?

53:58.892 --> 54:00.425
Yeah.

54:28.622 --> 54:36.364
Peter Peter Pumpkin Eater, had
a girl but couldn't keep her.

54:40.668 --> 54:42.834
We're not like those pussies
on those other ghost shows.

54:42.836 --> 54:46.504
Yeah. That's right. That's for

54:46.506 --> 54:54.412
my ex-girlfriend, the whore,
her pimp, and cock and balls.

54:54.414 --> 54:58.483
Oh, yeah. Kill
that dead motherfucker.

55:00.588 --> 55:06.695
Now, that's an exorcism.
Ew, you got brains on your top.

55:10.697 --> 55:12.064
Ew.

55:12.066 --> 55:17.568
Shit, Lorraine. Lorraine,

55:17.570 --> 55:26.778
stay with me. We beat Beck,
you hear me? Okay. We won.

55:26.780 --> 55:31.450
You... you got it on film?

55:31.452 --> 55:34.656
Yeah, we sure did.

55:37.657 --> 55:42.396
Inappropriate, Pete.

55:45.198 --> 55:48.700
Pete?

55:48.702 --> 55:50.705
Yeah.

55:52.572 --> 55:54.575
Is she...

55:55.776 --> 55:57.779
Wait for it.

56:06.486 --> 56:07.385
Yeah, now, she's dead.

56:07.387 --> 56:11.823
You sure? She
tends to lie a lot, Pete.

56:11.825 --> 56:15.463
There goes my spa weekend.

56:16.863 --> 56:19.867
You gonna be okay?

56:23.236 --> 56:25.439
Yeah.

56:26.673 --> 56:28.707
You think you could
put the toilet seat down for me,

56:28.709 --> 56:32.714
because I really have to go.

56:36.717 --> 56:38.050
Let's talk about this
whole possession thing.

56:38.052 --> 56:40.952
So the spirit
doesn't go into the living,

56:40.954 --> 56:43.955
it goes into the dead
for an hour. And then when you

56:43.957 --> 56:47.559
smash the dead dude's head,
it leaves the body?

56:51.865 --> 56:53.999
Yeah, but then where does it go?

56:54.001 --> 56:57.903
Because he's still got another
20 minutes left in this world

56:57.905 --> 57:03.077
according to my watch.

57:04.077 --> 57:07.916
Your turn.

57:12.919 --> 57:18.159
Pardon me.

57:20.927 --> 57:21.794
Ow!

57:21.796 --> 57:23.729
Oh, my God,
I'm so sorry, Lorraine.

57:23.731 --> 57:28.102
Inappropriate, Pete.

57:29.102 --> 57:34.606
Oh, you asshole! We
were gonna have babies!

57:34.608 --> 57:36.274
Lots and lots of babies.

57:36.276 --> 57:43.282
Okay. Okay. It's done. Alright.
Okay. Okay. Okay. It's done.

57:43.284 --> 57:46.050
She's right. She's
right, it's done. It's done.

57:46.052 --> 57:47.885
Sheryl's right.
It's done, buddy.

57:47.887 --> 57:49.921
Damn, it's more
blood and her hair.

57:49.923 --> 57:52.624
I hope those aren't pubes. Ugh!

57:52.626 --> 57:58.863
Okay. Okay.
He's gone. He's gone. He's gone.

57:58.865 --> 58:02.867
Jimmy's gotta be gone. Jimmy...
Jimmy... Timmy is gone, right?

58:02.869 --> 58:06.571
Right? There's no more. There's
no more freshly killed people.

58:06.573 --> 58:11.008
There's no more freshly killed
people. That's it. That's it. We

58:11.010 --> 58:13.010
just gotta walk back to town.

58:13.012 --> 58:15.046
Are you sure about that?

58:15.048 --> 58:17.349
I'm back.

58:17.351 --> 58:20.151
The fuck.

58:20.153 --> 58:22.155
Split up.

58:35.202 --> 58:38.604
I wish I had a weapon or a
really big cup of holy water.

58:38.606 --> 58:43.709
Oh hold on a second. We've
been going about this all wrong.

58:43.711 --> 58:45.744
We can't fight
the spirit and win.

58:45.746 --> 58:48.879
Yeah. Because we don't have a
giant cup of holy water, I know.

58:48.881 --> 58:56.821
No. We need the supernatural
to fight the supernatural.

58:56.823 --> 59:00.124
Yes. Yes. Like King
Kong or Godzilla, exactly.

59:00.126 --> 59:01.359
Or all those ghost clowns

59:01.361 --> 59:05.030
he killed whose souls are out
there. I've read enough scripts

59:05.032 --> 59:09.001
to know what their souls need is
redemption. I'm gonna get them

59:09.003 --> 59:13.070
to fight for us.
There's gotta be like, what,

59:13.072 --> 59:14.773
12 of them, maybe more?

59:14.775 --> 59:16.408
And don't
forget about that cat.

59:16.410 --> 59:21.912
Right. And the cat. They
all must hate him for what he

59:21.914 --> 59:30.722
did to them. Hmm.
They're gonna take our side.

59:41.168 --> 59:44.372
Ghost clowns?

59:49.043 --> 59:52.780
Ghostly alternative life style
midget clowns?

59:58.785 --> 01:00:00.885
I read somewhere that we only use
like 10 percent of our brain? Which

01:00:00.887 --> 01:00:02.921
means that we actually have all
this psychic ability stored up

01:00:02.923 --> 01:00:07.629
in like the other 70 percent.
All I have to do is believe.

01:00:09.430 --> 01:00:14.865
Come to me little people of the
night and assist us in the fight

01:00:14.867 --> 01:00:20.407
against the very spirit
that put you in the ground.

01:00:26.947 --> 01:00:29.247
You did it,
Sheryl, you're psychic.

01:00:29.249 --> 01:00:32.350
You really... you did it!

01:00:32.352 --> 01:00:35.754
Never underestimate
the power of positive energy.

01:00:43.796 --> 01:00:49.800
Oh. Oh.

01:00:49.802 --> 01:00:56.374
Oh, my God. What is it? What
is it? Ghost midget ectoplasm?

01:00:57.376 --> 01:01:00.144
Bad clowns,
very, very bad.

01:01:01.148 --> 01:01:03.280
Boobies!

01:01:03.282 --> 01:01:07.452
Shhh... We don't want
the crazy killer outside

01:01:07.454 --> 01:01:11.289
the door to hear us.

01:01:16.063 --> 01:01:20.966
Who's gonna be first?
The pussy camera guy?

01:01:20.968 --> 01:01:21.966
Shit!

01:01:21.968 --> 01:01:25.236
If clowns burst
through that door right now...

01:01:25.238 --> 01:01:28.008
Shhhh...

01:01:38.318 --> 01:01:42.323
I'm sorry. I'm just
really fucking terrified.

01:01:44.157 --> 01:01:47.291
Do your countdown thing.
Do your countdown thing, okay?

01:01:47.293 --> 01:01:49.160
Okay.

01:01:49.162 --> 01:01:50.961
I'll be right back.

01:01:50.963 --> 01:01:53.798
You're leaving me?

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:58.303
I have to
pee really bad.

01:01:58.305 --> 01:02:00.238
Still?

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:02.407
I kinda got interrupted before.

01:02:02.409 --> 01:02:04.778
Oh.

01:02:07.514 --> 01:02:09.914
Just promise me you'll stay
right here, okay? No matter

01:02:09.916 --> 01:02:12.017
what, you stay right here. Just
stay right here and I promise

01:02:12.019 --> 01:02:13.251
I'll be back.

01:02:13.253 --> 01:02:14.820
Okay.

01:02:19.959 --> 01:02:24.965
Number six, Mariah Carey
"Vision of Love."

01:02:32.238 --> 01:02:37.475
OW!

01:02:42.249 --> 01:02:44.352
Ow! Get off my titty!

01:02:44.985 --> 01:02:48.854
Number five, Taylor Swift,
"Shake it Off."

01:02:48.856 --> 01:02:50.321
Shake it off.

01:02:59.265 --> 01:03:03.336
Number four,
Lady Gaga, "Bad Romance."

01:03:03.871 --> 01:03:06.874
I'm gonna fuck
your face.

01:03:37.303 --> 01:03:40.974
Oh, God. Oh, my, God, Daniel.

01:03:42.209 --> 01:03:46.247
Oh, God, Daniel. I'm so sorry.

01:03:48.014 --> 01:03:53.019
You told me to stay.
You made me promise.

01:04:13.307 --> 01:04:15.309
Fuck these spirits.

01:04:16.075 --> 01:04:19.112
Oh, I'm gonna avenge you.

01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:24.950
I'm gonna burn this place to the
ground. The world will know

01:04:24.952 --> 01:04:29.457
about the sacrifices you made
here. Oh, they will.

01:04:30.057 --> 01:04:33.457
Yes, they will. Yes, they will.

01:04:43.202 --> 01:04:46.738
I held my breath for way over
a minute that time, Sheryl.

01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:48.039
Way over a minute.

01:04:48.041 --> 01:04:51.408
I am going to shoehorn your

01:04:51.410 --> 01:04:55.416
asshole wide open, motherfucker.

01:05:02.722 --> 01:05:05.927
Get off me!

01:05:17.436 --> 01:05:19.439
Wait!

01:05:22.776 --> 01:05:24.979
It's me, Pete.

01:05:26.512 --> 01:05:28.546
We can't risk it.

01:05:28.548 --> 01:05:30.048
Open the door!

01:05:32.119 --> 01:05:34.084
This is karma for
not picking up your dad.

01:05:34.086 --> 01:05:36.254
What?

01:05:36.256 --> 01:05:38.523
Open the door, please. Open the
door. Please open the door.

01:05:38.525 --> 01:05:40.624
Please open the door.

01:05:40.626 --> 01:05:44.595
Hey. Just, uh, just...- Hey.

01:05:44.597 --> 01:05:45.662
A hallucination.

01:05:45.664 --> 01:05:48.033
Asshole. Fuck you.

01:06:05.452 --> 01:06:07.388
He did just buy us some time.

01:06:17.197 --> 01:06:19.696
What the fuck
are you doing, pervert?

01:06:19.698 --> 01:06:24.102
Oh, wait.
We can't leave him.

01:06:24.104 --> 01:06:26.171
What? You just locked him out.

01:06:26.173 --> 01:06:27.305
I know, I panicked.

01:06:27.307 --> 01:06:30.675
What are you doing
with my nipple? Ah!

01:06:30.677 --> 01:06:32.343
Get off our cameraman!

01:06:32.345 --> 01:06:35.345
You want to grab tits, asshole?
Grab this.

01:06:35.347 --> 01:06:36.680
Oh, shit.

01:06:36.682 --> 01:06:39.651
Stronger reflexes in this body.

01:06:39.653 --> 01:06:41.251
Oh, shit!

01:06:41.253 --> 01:06:45.358
- No one leaves.
- Hang on.

01:06:45.791 --> 01:06:47.794
Hurry! Hurry!

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:55.867
Oh, get in! Get in, Pete!
Get in!

01:06:55.869 --> 01:06:57.234
Oh, no,
you're messing it up!

01:06:57.236 --> 01:06:58.535
I'm sorry!

01:06:58.537 --> 01:06:59.736
Pete, you gotta
get in the circle.

01:06:59.738 --> 01:07:00.671
Ah!

01:07:00.673 --> 01:07:01.738
Get in the circle.

01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:03.408
You think I don't want to?

01:07:10.851 --> 01:07:13.383
Oh my god. I think it worked.
He can't get in.

01:07:13.385 --> 01:07:15.285
Yeah, you can't
get in, dickhead.

01:07:17.224 --> 01:07:22.063
We're safe inside the circle.
We just have to wait it out.

01:07:22.863 --> 01:07:25.265
How long?
Two minutes.

01:07:29.869 --> 01:07:30.936
What's he doing?

01:07:30.938 --> 01:07:34.138
I don't know. Sheryl?
Sheryl? Sheryl?

01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:34.939
I don't know.

01:07:34.941 --> 01:07:36.744
Sheryl? Sheryl?
Sheryl? Sheryl?

01:07:37.744 --> 01:07:41.579
Ah! Ah! Ah!

01:07:41.581 --> 01:07:43.648
Ah! Ah! Ah!

01:07:43.650 --> 01:07:45.653
He's in.

01:07:46.586 --> 01:07:49.723
But not the spirit. See?

01:07:50.157 --> 01:07:54.258
He messed up. He messed up.
Yeah, he's messed up.

01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:56.894
There's no more dead
bodies for him to slide into.

01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:04.769
Quit fooling around dickhead.
Your titty twisting days are

01:08:04.771 --> 01:08:06.570
done.

01:08:12.646 --> 01:08:14.314
Oh, God.

01:08:16.816 --> 01:08:19.385
Who's that?

01:08:36.803 --> 01:08:38.671
I didn't get paid.

01:08:39.738 --> 01:08:43.372
Where did you come from?

01:08:43.375 --> 01:08:47.313
I came in a few minutes
ago to check up on y'all.

01:08:48.314 --> 01:08:52.381
Had some chest pains.

01:08:52.384 --> 01:08:55.618
Victim Stan, we don't
have a ride back to town, sir.

01:08:55.621 --> 01:09:00.291
Would you mind giving us a lift?

01:09:00.292 --> 01:09:02.694
Hmm. Not at all.

01:09:02.696 --> 01:09:07.966
Yeah. And also, there might have
been a few unexplained deaths on

01:09:07.968 --> 01:09:11.234
and about the premises.

01:09:11.237 --> 01:09:14.274
Oh. You don't say.

01:09:16.475 --> 01:09:21.514
Maybe we can get
the murder tours going again.

01:09:22.514 --> 01:09:23.513
Yeah, maybe.

01:09:23.515 --> 01:09:26.586
If it works out
in your favor, why not, sir?

01:09:44.004 --> 01:09:48.209
And Stan, about
your cat, sir, um-

01:09:48.707 --> 01:09:50.841
How do I put it?

01:09:50.844 --> 01:09:51.841
Pretty dead.

01:09:51.844 --> 01:09:53.477
Yeah.

01:09:53.479 --> 01:09:55.480
Yeah.

01:09:55.482 --> 01:09:57.484
Sorry.

01:09:57.983 --> 01:10:02.386
And it's such a shame about
Fluffy because he was such

01:10:02.388 --> 01:10:05.793
a kind, warm-spirited kitten.

01:10:08.428 --> 01:10:10.328
Yeah.

01:10:10.330 --> 01:10:15.336
Fluffy, yeah.
Damn fine kitty.

01:10:18.304 --> 01:10:23.309
How are we gonna explain
this to the police?

01:10:24.611 --> 01:10:28.078
You don't intend on
letting us get to the police,

01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:31.048
do you, Jimmy?

01:10:39.893 --> 01:10:42.726
What gave me away?

01:10:42.728 --> 01:10:45.932
The kitten's name
was Mittens, not Fluffy.

01:10:46.732 --> 01:10:49.766
And, uh, Stan
really loved his pussy.

01:10:49.768 --> 01:10:54.338
Let me tell you a little
story about your friend, Stan.

01:10:54.340 --> 01:11:01.347
When saw his dead little pussy,
he had himself a heart attack

01:11:01.781 --> 01:11:04.785
Fell out right there.

01:11:07.487 --> 01:11:12.760
I saw an in,
and I took it.

01:11:15.661 --> 01:11:17.861
You two would make
really good investigators in

01:11:17.863 --> 01:11:19.529
real life. Just saying.

01:11:19.531 --> 01:11:21.534
Shut up!

01:11:22.434 --> 01:11:26.740
It's time to pick
up where I-

01:11:29.409 --> 01:11:31.612
left off.

01:11:35.548 --> 01:11:39.353
Get your asses
outside! Now!

01:11:39.952 --> 01:11:43.956
I said, move. Look tits.

01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:47.327
Get outside.
Get out there! Turn around.

01:11:48.894 --> 01:11:51.962
Keep it moving. Don't
look at me! Follow him.

01:11:51.964 --> 01:11:54.632
Hands on his shoulders.
Get in line.

01:11:58.405 --> 01:11:59.471
Ahh!

01:11:59.473 --> 01:12:03.410
- Okay. Okay, okay, okay.
- Get over there.

01:12:06.745 --> 01:12:08.078
What's the matter?

01:12:14.187 --> 01:12:17.555
Unh-unh. Unh-unh. Unh-unh.
Unh-unh. Unh-unh.

01:12:17.557 --> 01:12:19.559
Get your asses
down those stairs.

01:12:21.494 --> 01:12:24.798
I said now! Get!

01:12:31.170 --> 01:12:32.169
Are you sure...

01:12:32.171 --> 01:12:34.441
- Down!
- Okay.

01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:51.525
Maybe we should settle this
over a game of flashlight tag.

01:12:54.661 --> 01:12:59.433
Oh, yeah. I used to love that game.
Didn't you, Pete?

01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:02.934
This isn't really
the time to reminisce.

01:13:02.936 --> 01:13:07.137
Pete, wouldn't
you like to play a game of

01:13:07.139 --> 01:13:11.711
flashlight tag with
him? With your flashlight?

01:13:14.179 --> 01:13:16.146
Right now.

01:13:16.148 --> 01:13:20.887
Yes. I would
love to play flashlight tag,

01:13:23.555 --> 01:13:25.659
as long as I'm not it. Ah!

01:13:27.693 --> 01:13:30.696
Those damn energy drinks.

01:13:32.232 --> 01:13:35.602
Move.

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:43.576
Oh!

01:13:49.682 --> 01:13:51.751
Move.

01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:04.962
Wasn't there a time
limit to being in this world?

01:14:04.964 --> 01:14:09.033
You botched the ritual earlier.
There are no time

01:14:09.035 --> 01:14:11.905
restraints anymore.

01:14:13.772 --> 01:14:16.140
Where you taking us, Jimmy?

01:14:16.142 --> 01:14:20.147
To where I bury the bodies.

01:14:23.883 --> 01:14:26.249
You want us to see
for ourselves, don't you?

01:14:26.251 --> 01:14:28.718
You're wracked with guilt,
and if you take us to the spot,

01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:31.724
you'll feel some
sense of closure, right?

01:14:33.192 --> 01:14:36.726
There is no motive
other than I intend

01:14:36.728 --> 01:14:40.133
to cut your eyes out
and slice out your tongue.

01:14:44.137 --> 01:14:47.038
Can't you just shoot
just like you did Pete?

01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:51.545
Don't worry, I'll be
entering him soon enough.

01:14:52.844 --> 01:14:54.678
Uh, for the
record, that means, uh...

01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:57.584
Turn around.

01:15:02.254 --> 01:15:04.590
On your knees.

01:15:09.896 --> 01:15:12.730
I got an idea.
Let's start with your mouth

01:15:12.732 --> 01:15:16.202
first because it's so pretty.

01:15:17.269 --> 01:15:20.904
Um, are you
thinking the knife or the gun?

01:15:20.906 --> 01:15:24.175
Because I have a severe
phobia to both of those.

01:15:24.177 --> 01:15:27.611
I can't let evil win. I can't
let evil win. I have to believe.

01:15:27.613 --> 01:15:29.346
I have to believe. I do believe.

01:15:29.348 --> 01:15:31.015
I really don't like
anything in my mouth.

01:15:31.017 --> 01:15:34.185
I command all
you restless spirits to come to

01:15:34.187 --> 01:15:38.088
the aid of me and my friend.
Come to us now and protect us

01:15:38.090 --> 01:15:42.195
against this demon-infested
fiend.

01:15:43.629 --> 01:15:45.096
What are you doing?

01:15:45.098 --> 01:15:46.830
It's working, Sheryl. It's
working. You're talking to

01:15:46.832 --> 01:15:47.698
the dead. Keep going.

01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:48.932
That's enough out of you!

01:15:48.934 --> 01:15:51.901
Come to us now. Come
and take away the evil that

01:15:51.903 --> 01:15:54.939
has taken your souls
and wants to take more.

01:15:56.041 --> 01:15:58.376
Ah!

01:15:58.378 --> 01:15:59.577
Get away.

01:15:59.579 --> 01:16:04.949
Come now. It is time for your
redemption. It is time for you

01:16:04.951 --> 01:16:07.621
to take your revenge.

01:16:12.125 --> 01:16:16.930
No! No! Ah!

01:16:19.698 --> 01:16:23.970
NO! OH! OH!

01:16:28.974 --> 01:16:31.044
Holy shit!

01:16:31.244 --> 01:16:33.246
Holy shit,
Sheryl, you did it!

01:16:35.048 --> 01:16:37.050
You did it!

01:16:38.918 --> 01:16:42.054
Oh, oh, my God.

01:16:44.089 --> 01:16:47.425
That's the power
of positive energy.

01:16:47.427 --> 01:16:51.962
Let's figure out how
to get the hell out of here.

01:16:51.964 --> 01:16:55.969
Oh, Stan's car!
Maybe there's keys in it.

01:16:56.469 --> 01:17:01.274
Hey! You guys
were gonna leave me?

01:17:03.108 --> 01:17:05.646
Our bad.

01:17:05.844 --> 01:17:07.847
Shotgun.

01:17:10.383 --> 01:17:11.351
My camera.

01:17:12.117 --> 01:17:16.052
Hey, I gotta get
my camera. Hey, don't leave me!

01:17:16.054 --> 01:17:20.860
I'm fucking serious. Don't
fucking Leave me here.

01:17:26.398 --> 01:17:28.401
Go! Go!

01:17:29.469 --> 01:17:30.668
So what happened?

01:17:30.670 --> 01:17:33.002
Oh, Sheryl was great. She was
great. She used her psychic

01:17:33.004 --> 01:17:34.805
powers and she
summoned the supernatural.

01:17:34.807 --> 01:17:35.972
What?

01:17:35.974 --> 01:17:38.476
Let's just say we had a
little help from the other side.

01:17:38.478 --> 01:17:40.410
Lorraine was there for us.

01:17:40.412 --> 01:17:42.413
What, really?

01:17:42.415 --> 01:17:45.916
Oh, wow.
How did she look?

01:17:45.918 --> 01:17:47.752
Inappropriate, Pete.

01:17:47.754 --> 01:17:52.291
What, I'm... I'm... I'm
sorry, okay? I liked her.

01:17:53.058 --> 01:17:54.324
There, I said it.

01:17:54.326 --> 01:17:56.329
I know.

01:17:58.130 --> 01:18:01.901
Uh, weren't the house
lights on a second ago?

01:18:07.939 --> 01:18:10.141
You always have to
notice everything, Pete.

01:18:10.143 --> 01:18:13.377
Yeah. Can you just stop
recording for like a minute just

01:18:13.379 --> 01:18:15.779
so we can, you know,
get out of here?

01:18:15.781 --> 01:18:16.780
Yeah.

01:18:16.782 --> 01:18:19.318
Uh, not yet. Look.

01:18:22.321 --> 01:18:24.053
Oh, what the hell?

01:18:35.134 --> 01:18:37.434
Hell yes. Hell yes!

01:18:37.436 --> 01:18:42.742
Yeah. You got that zombie cat.

01:18:43.041 --> 01:18:46.780
Actually, no. That
was just a regular cat.

01:18:47.446 --> 01:18:52.048
You guys didn't notice the
different color or that it was a

01:18:52.050 --> 01:18:55.351
little bit bigger, and that it
wasn't all bloody and half

01:18:55.353 --> 01:18:57.356
mangled?

01:19:08.233 --> 01:19:10.133
I got service.

01:19:10.135 --> 01:19:15.338
Yes! 911 right now. Tell
them we're coming in hot. Gunshot.

01:19:15.340 --> 01:19:16.343
Male.

01:19:19.512 --> 01:19:24.183
I got our next show for
the network right here. Aw yeah!

01:19:26.184 --> 01:19:30.287
Beat me with a broomstick.
We are gonna be famous.
