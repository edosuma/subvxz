00:01.369 --> 00:02.602
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Ready? Okay.

00:02.636 --> 00:03.804
Jane the virgin
 was accidentally

00:03.836 --> 00:05.339
artificially inseminated,

00:05.373 --> 00:07.608
and she had baby Mateo.

00:07.641 --> 00:09.143
But he was kidnapped

00:09.177 --> 00:11.079
and then traded
 for this flash drive.

00:11.112 --> 00:14.148
Luckily, Jane and Rafael
 got him back.

00:14.182 --> 00:16.817
And they would have lived
 happily ever after,

00:16.850 --> 00:19.553
except she chose to be
 with Michael. Only problem?

00:19.587 --> 00:21.155
You turned me in!
Stop!

00:21.189 --> 00:22.756
But it turns out,
 Michael was right.

00:22.790 --> 00:24.458
You paid me to lie to
the cops about Cordero.

00:24.492 --> 00:26.594
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Rafael did rat him out.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.096
Unfortunately, it was too late.

00:28.129 --> 00:29.463
Michael had moved on.

00:29.497 --> 00:31.832
Oh, and her baby daddy,
 Rafael, well,

00:31.865 --> 00:33.301
his life was complicated, too.

00:33.334 --> 00:35.069
See, his other baby mama,

00:35.103 --> 00:37.505
Petra, was in a bit of a jam.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.207
He mother killed someone
 and then blamed her.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.109
Talk about
 dysfunctional family, right?

00:41.142 --> 00:42.743
Well, how about this?

00:42.776 --> 00:46.114
Rafael's mom abandoned him
 when he was four.

00:46.147 --> 00:47.581
Oh, and his half-sister, Luisa,

00:47.615 --> 00:50.184
well, her mom was
 a criminal mastermind

00:50.218 --> 00:52.120
called Mutter,
 and her signature

00:52.153 --> 00:53.854
was blue silk ties.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.390
And Detective Michael was
 on the hunt for her,

00:56.424 --> 00:57.591
along with Susanna,

00:57.625 --> 00:58.859
who Luisa kind of liked.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.461
As in, like-liked.

01:00.494 --> 01:02.663
Oh, and speaking of romance,

01:02.696 --> 01:04.765
Michael returned
 Jane's tree topper.

01:04.798 --> 01:07.201
So maybe there was hope
 for them after all.

01:07.235 --> 01:08.436
I guess we'll see.

01:10.238 --> 01:12.406
It is a truth
 universally acknowledged

01:12.440 --> 01:15.143
that Jane Gloriana Villanueva
 loved school.

01:15.809 --> 01:17.411
(whistle blows)

01:17.445 --> 01:19.547
However, she didn't love
 all of school.

01:21.215 --> 01:24.118
Specifically second grade
 gym class.

01:24.152 --> 01:26.387
Because of Tommy Boxer.
Yes!

01:26.420 --> 01:28.156
Fortunately, Jane's abuela

01:28.189 --> 01:29.457
gave her the tools to deal
 with boys like that.

01:29.490 --> 01:30.691
Tommy?

01:30.724 --> 01:32.660
I know what's going on here.

01:32.693 --> 01:35.396
You're extra mean to me
because you like me.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.398
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Ah, yes, that old chestnut.

01:37.431 --> 01:38.832
And just so you know,

01:38.866 --> 01:40.734
that is not the way
to get me to like you.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.603
I respond to kindness.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.738
Your grandma's wrong.

01:44.772 --> 01:47.641
I'm mean 'cause of math class.

01:51.712 --> 01:54.182
You're only cheating yourself,
you know.

01:54.215 --> 01:56.184
(sighs)

01:56.217 --> 01:58.152
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah,
 Jane didn't see that coming.

01:58.186 --> 01:59.453
(grunts)
 Or that.

01:59.487 --> 02:00.521
(knocking)

02:02.956 --> 02:04.392
Hey.

02:04.425 --> 02:05.559
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Or this.

02:05.593 --> 02:07.895
Hey.

02:07.928 --> 02:09.797
So, listen,
you're probably wondering
I wanted to reach out

02:09.830 --> 02:12.600
and thank you
for the tree topper.
why I left the tree topper.

02:13.567 --> 02:14.902
(chuckles)

02:14.935 --> 02:17.371
I want you to know
that you were right,

02:17.405 --> 02:19.540
uh, about Rafael turning you in.

02:19.573 --> 02:21.375
Yeah, I know.

02:21.409 --> 02:23.644
But I get it. He was
looking out for his family.

02:23.677 --> 02:25.713
Anyway, we talked.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.681
He and I are all good now.

02:27.715 --> 02:30.551
And I was hoping
maybe you and I could...

02:30.584 --> 02:31.785
maybe be good.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.654
Really?

02:33.687 --> 02:35.456
Really.

02:37.458 --> 02:39.293
(Mateo crying)

02:39.327 --> 02:41.829
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 No, Mateo, not again.

02:41.862 --> 02:42.963
Mateo.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.432
Come on.

02:44.465 --> 02:45.966
Not again.

02:45.999 --> 02:49.837
Oh, it's 2:37 a.m.

02:49.870 --> 02:53.407
This sleep regression
has got to end, baby.

02:53.441 --> 02:55.209
Okay?

02:55.243 --> 02:56.310
Shh.

02:56.344 --> 02:57.978
Try to go to sleep.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.580
Yeah?

02:59.613 --> 03:00.614
Yeah? Oh.

03:00.648 --> 03:01.815
(Mateo crying)

03:01.849 --> 03:04.285
(door opens)
XIOMARA: Jane, come on.

03:04.318 --> 03:05.753
Rogelio's mom comes tomorrow,

03:05.786 --> 03:07.321
and I cannot face that woman

03:07.355 --> 03:08.556
on less than eight hours
of sleep.

03:08.589 --> 03:10.724
I'm trying, obviously.

03:17.398 --> 03:18.799
I'm not comfortable with that.

03:20.501 --> 03:22.236
Wait.

03:22.270 --> 03:24.805
He's getting sleepy.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.576
Oh, buddy.

03:28.609 --> 03:31.812
Yeah, buddy, oh.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.584
(whispering):
Okay.

03:40.821 --> 03:42.656
(crying)

03:47.828 --> 03:50.030
(Jane yawns)

03:50.063 --> 03:51.799
I want you both to know
that I am on it.

03:51.832 --> 03:53.501
When Mateo woke up at 4:30,

03:53.534 --> 03:55.736
I researched some very gentle
sleep training methods.

04:00.441 --> 04:01.542
No.

04:03.010 --> 04:05.613
For you, but there are other
well-researched methods.

04:07.348 --> 04:08.882
His lovey.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.318
I'm supposed to wear it
in my bra

04:10.351 --> 04:11.785
so that he can smell me
and feel like

04:11.819 --> 04:13.053
I'm with him
throughout the night.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.456
(sighs)
And your opinion is noted.

04:15.489 --> 04:17.858
(kisses)

04:17.891 --> 04:18.992
Hmm.

04:19.026 --> 04:20.327
Hon, can you maybe not eat?

04:20.361 --> 04:21.462
Liliana will be
here any minute.

04:21.495 --> 04:22.730
Mom, you need
to just relax.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.064
Remember, Dad said
that Grandma

04:24.097 --> 04:25.666
was much more chill
when she's with Grandpa.

04:25.699 --> 04:26.834
Ay, shh, shh...
Whoa.

04:34.041 --> 04:35.409
Hello, everyone.

04:35.443 --> 04:37.611
Glamma is here.

04:37.645 --> 04:38.812
(squeals)

04:45.085 --> 04:46.820
Jane, you look

04:46.854 --> 04:48.956
adorable and darling.

04:48.989 --> 04:51.091
And, Alba, so good to see you.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.394
(kisses)

04:54.528 --> 04:56.430
Hello, Xiomara.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.967
Liliana.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.569
Where's Grandpa?

05:01.602 --> 05:02.970
Well, it turns out that

05:03.003 --> 05:05.473
he was not well enough
to travel after all.

05:05.506 --> 05:06.640
It's, it's a shame.

05:06.674 --> 05:09.577
Aw, I was really
excited to meet him.

05:09.610 --> 05:10.844
I know, I know.

05:10.878 --> 05:12.780
But, uh, you know,
better safe than sorry.

05:12.813 --> 05:13.914
(Mateo crying)

05:13.947 --> 05:15.383
Can I get him?

05:15.416 --> 05:17.785
I could use a pinch
of happiness

05:17.818 --> 05:19.720
in my current state.
Mm-hmm.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.855
Thank you.

05:21.889 --> 05:23.357
Oh.

05:23.391 --> 05:25.459
What's going on
with your mother?

05:25.493 --> 05:26.760
I have no idea.

05:26.794 --> 05:28.596
She was like that
the whole car ride down.

05:28.629 --> 05:30.464
Happy, then sad.

05:30.498 --> 05:33.033
She wouldn't even duet
to "Endless Love."

05:33.066 --> 05:34.735
Did you ask her?
Of course I did.

05:34.768 --> 05:36.003
Over and over.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.805
I even sang her part.

05:37.838 --> 05:38.772
JANE:
Poor Grandma.

05:38.806 --> 05:40.073
Let me go check on Mateo

05:40.107 --> 05:42.376
and see if maybe
she'll talk to me.

05:48.115 --> 05:49.483
He's adorable.

05:49.517 --> 05:50.618
Thanks.

05:50.651 --> 05:51.885
A little less adorable

05:51.919 --> 05:53.421
when he wakes up every hour.

05:53.454 --> 05:54.622
Ah.

05:54.655 --> 05:55.956
So, Glamma,

05:55.989 --> 05:57.625
is everything okay with you?

05:57.658 --> 05:58.892
Oh, yes.

05:58.926 --> 06:00.761
Yes, I'm-I'm just a little...

06:00.794 --> 06:04.665
overwhelmed seeing
my beautiful great-grandson.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.668
Okay.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.069
Just seems like maybe
there's something else.

06:09.102 --> 06:11.371
And if there is,
you can tell me.

06:14.007 --> 06:15.609
Okay.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.680
Your grandfather is gay.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.081
And he has left me.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.618
For a man.

06:26.153 --> 06:27.855
Oh, wow. Wow.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.022
Wow. (chuckles)

06:29.056 --> 06:31.091
Oh, wow.

06:31.124 --> 06:32.693
You are so right.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.061
I feel so much better.

06:34.094 --> 06:35.195
(laughs)
Good, good.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.530
Now, listen, you cannot

06:36.564 --> 06:38.699
tell anybody.

06:38.732 --> 06:39.833
And you can especially

06:39.867 --> 06:41.769
not tell your father,

06:41.802 --> 06:44.738
because I know how much
he idealized our marriage.

06:44.772 --> 06:46.640
And when he finds out
that it was all a lie,

06:46.674 --> 06:48.476
he is going to be so devastated.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.143
Jane?
Uh-huh?

06:50.177 --> 06:52.079
I can trust you, yes?

06:52.112 --> 06:53.747
(grunts softly)

06:57.618 --> 06:58.752
No big deal.

06:58.786 --> 07:00.588
Yeah, it was just, like,
you know,

07:00.621 --> 07:02.823
terrible food on the airplane
and they charge for it now.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.658
So it's so annoying.

07:04.692 --> 07:06.560
Oh, okay.

07:06.594 --> 07:09.563
Well, I'll just send a series
of irate tweets to the airline.

07:09.597 --> 07:11.699
They're gonna respond with
a flight voucher or something.

07:11.732 --> 07:13.534
Thank you, Jane.
No problem.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.102
Okay, I'm gonna go shower,
because I got to go teach.

07:15.135 --> 07:16.837
Thank you guys
for watching Mateo.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.005
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Okay, from one mama drama

07:18.038 --> 07:19.740
to another.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.543
WOMAN: There's security footage
of you wheeling Ivan

07:22.576 --> 07:23.577
out of the hotel.

07:23.611 --> 07:24.845
I was helping my mother.

07:24.878 --> 07:25.846
The murder weapon
has Ivan's blood

07:25.879 --> 07:27.681
on it and your fingerprints.

07:27.715 --> 07:28.949
Yeah, but this isn't
the murder weapon.

07:28.982 --> 07:30.484
The murder weapon
was my mother's hook.

07:30.518 --> 07:32.019
WOMAN: Well, no one knows
 where that is.

07:32.052 --> 07:33.220
'Cause she had that one removed
last month.

07:33.253 --> 07:34.755
It could be at
the bottom of the ocean.

07:34.788 --> 07:35.856
And without it,

07:35.889 --> 07:36.890
the case comes down

07:36.924 --> 07:38.225
to your word against hers.

07:38.258 --> 07:40.127
My mother is a convicted felon.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.829
She also came forward--
you didn't.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.263
RAFAEL:
Okay.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.866
Okay, so what
happens next?

07:45.899 --> 07:48.268
(muffled):
Because Petra obviously
didn't do this.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.838
(muffled):
Indictment is likely.

07:50.871 --> 07:52.973
Self-defense.

07:53.006 --> 07:54.708
It's 15 years to life.

07:54.742 --> 07:57.044
Without the
murder weapon...

07:57.077 --> 07:58.011
Petra.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.248
Yeah, sorry.
What were you saying?

08:01.281 --> 08:02.783
That you will be indicted

08:02.816 --> 08:04.618
unless you can get
your mother to confess.

08:05.953 --> 08:07.688
We're gonna figure
this out, okay?

08:07.721 --> 08:09.857
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Also nervous...

08:09.890 --> 08:11.124
Jane.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.026
Not indicted-for-murder
 nervous,

08:13.060 --> 08:17.598
more like first-day-as-
 a-teacher's-assistant nervous.

08:17.631 --> 08:18.732
(whispering):
Okay.

08:18.766 --> 08:19.900
(door opens)

08:19.933 --> 08:21.935
Oh, hi.

08:21.969 --> 08:23.671
(indistinct chatter)

08:23.704 --> 08:25.839
Welcome. (chuckles)

08:25.873 --> 08:27.808
Wow, there's lots
of tall people here.

08:27.841 --> 08:28.909
Whoa.

08:28.942 --> 08:30.978
Hmm, okay.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.881
Welcome to Great Books 105.

08:33.914 --> 08:35.749
I am Jane Villanueva,

08:35.783 --> 08:37.017
your section leader.

08:37.049 --> 08:39.251
And I can promise you

08:39.285 --> 08:41.121
that the course name d... Oh.

08:41.154 --> 08:42.322
Hi.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.124
I was just... (clears throat)

08:45.893 --> 08:48.195
I can promise you that
the course name doesn't lie.

08:48.228 --> 08:49.963
These are great books.

08:51.364 --> 08:55.235
Okay, so I hope you all enjoyed

08:55.268 --> 08:57.270
Pride and Prejudice
over your break.

08:57.304 --> 08:59.139
I know I loved rereading it.

08:59.172 --> 09:01.108
We'll start

09:01.141 --> 09:02.943
with the immortal line,

09:02.976 --> 09:05.178
"It is a truth
universally acknowledged

09:05.212 --> 09:08.649
"that a single man
in possession of a good fortune

09:08.682 --> 09:10.818
must be in want of a wife."

09:10.851 --> 09:12.820
Can anyone unpack that?

09:14.688 --> 09:16.824
(sighs)
Okay, I'm gonna steer a little.

09:16.857 --> 09:20.093
Uh, thoughts on how it frames
the marriage plot narrative

09:20.127 --> 09:23.597
in satirical, rather than
straightforward, terms?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.101
You.

09:28.135 --> 09:29.369
Any thoughts on the quote?

09:29.402 --> 09:30.704
Uh...

09:36.744 --> 09:38.846
I haven't gotten to that part
of the book yet.

09:38.879 --> 09:40.180
(chuckles)

09:40.213 --> 09:41.248
It's the first line.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.750
(laughter)

09:44.284 --> 09:45.719
Did you read the book?

09:45.753 --> 09:46.987
Uh, dude.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.321
What's up with the teacher?

09:48.355 --> 09:49.790
Books for Ballers
is supposed to be easy.

09:49.823 --> 09:50.824
Excuse me.

09:50.858 --> 09:52.259
What did you call this class?

09:52.292 --> 09:54.094
Uh, Books for Ballers.

09:54.127 --> 09:55.996
"Books for..."

09:56.029 --> 09:57.397
STUDENT:
If you're actually gonna make us

09:57.430 --> 09:59.332
read all these books,
can you at least explain

09:59.366 --> 10:00.834
how to drop the class first?

10:00.868 --> 10:02.269
(laughter)

10:04.004 --> 10:05.272
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Yeah, so it's a truth

10:05.305 --> 10:06.840
universally acknowledged

10:06.874 --> 10:07.875
that Jane did not see
 that coming.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.315
Wow, and they got a shot off.

10:15.348 --> 10:17.017
What a game.
Wow.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.719
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 I'm confused.

10:18.752 --> 10:19.920
Who are these people,
 and what have they done

10:19.953 --> 10:21.054
with the Villanuevas?

10:21.088 --> 10:22.923
Okay, cool. This is exciting.

10:22.956 --> 10:25.759
Right? I mean, one point
right before the buzzer.

10:27.828 --> 10:29.396
Well, way to be supportive.

10:29.429 --> 10:30.831
I'm trying to connect
with my students here, Abuela.

10:34.802 --> 10:36.837
Stop. Please.

10:44.444 --> 10:46.680
Okay, well, I'm not
doing that, so, enough.

10:49.249 --> 10:51.051
(sighs)
(phone chimes)

11:07.167 --> 11:08.101
(indistinct conversation)

11:08.135 --> 11:09.837
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Don't look at me.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.772
I have no idea
 who she is, either.

11:11.805 --> 11:14.007
*

11:20.280 --> 11:21.849
This makes no sense.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.751
These therapy transcripts
are just the ramblings

11:23.784 --> 11:25.185
of a mentally ill woman.

11:25.218 --> 11:27.454
Well, if Mia was gonna
hide out in an institution,

11:27.487 --> 11:28.989
she's got to make it
look real.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.758
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 To give you a refresher...

11:31.491 --> 11:33.693
(bell dings twice)

11:34.928 --> 11:36.363
(bell dings twice)

11:38.298 --> 11:40.901
(bell dings twice)

11:40.934 --> 11:42.469
(scoffs) Well, she
did a good job.

11:42.502 --> 11:43.904
I mean, listen to this:

11:43.937 --> 11:45.839
"Mia likes mint chip ice cream.

11:45.873 --> 11:48.175
"She dreams of vacationing
by a magical lake.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.810
Collects Hummel figurines."

11:49.843 --> 11:52.112
Well, it doesn't mean
anything to us.

11:52.145 --> 11:55.048
But... it might mean something
to your girlfriend.

11:55.082 --> 11:56.784
Oh, shut up.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.886
But, yeah, we're gonna
have to talk to Luisa.

11:59.953 --> 12:01.488
Heads or tails?
Heads.

12:04.191 --> 12:05.325
You gonna wear something sexy?

12:05.358 --> 12:07.795
It's gonna be so awkward.

12:07.828 --> 12:10.063
LATIN LOVE NARRATOR: Well, at
 least not as awkward as this.

12:10.097 --> 12:12.265
LILIANA: When Manuel
was touching me,

12:12.299 --> 12:13.366
and we were making love,

12:13.400 --> 12:16.403
is-is he thinking about
another man the whole time?

12:16.436 --> 12:17.470
You know?
Yeah, I do.

12:17.504 --> 12:18.471
XIOMARA:
Oh.

12:18.505 --> 12:19.572
Hey there.

12:19.606 --> 12:21.474
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Uh-oh. Did she hear that?

12:21.508 --> 12:24.111
I-I think your Uber's
waiting outside, Liliana.

12:24.144 --> 12:25.112
Thank you very much.

12:25.145 --> 12:26.313
Okay, I will, uh...

12:26.346 --> 12:28.782
I will see all of you tomorrow.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.184
So, where are those Cubanos?

12:32.886 --> 12:35.488
I think I might've
found something out.

12:35.522 --> 12:37.791
You heard?
You know?

12:37.825 --> 12:39.526
She told me this morning.
She who?

12:39.559 --> 12:41.128
Wait, what did you find out?

12:41.161 --> 12:43.096
I think Michael
has a girlfriend.

12:43.130 --> 12:45.065
He does?

12:45.098 --> 12:46.066
I don't know.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.067
I saw him talking to someone

12:47.100 --> 12:48.201
and they looked like a couple.

12:48.235 --> 12:52.305
I know because of the tree
topper, you thought maybe...

12:52.339 --> 12:53.473
Yeah, no, uh...

12:53.506 --> 12:54.875
It's good to know.

12:54.908 --> 12:56.844
Or maybe know.

12:56.877 --> 12:58.478
So, wait, what were
you talking about?

12:58.511 --> 13:00.313
Yeah, no, same thing.

13:00.347 --> 13:01.982
Jane...

13:02.015 --> 13:03.383
Okay, but you have to swear
not to tell anybody.

13:03.416 --> 13:04.517
I swear!

13:04.551 --> 13:07.120
Manuel is gay.
What...?

13:07.154 --> 13:08.321
And he's leaving Liliana
for a man,

13:08.355 --> 13:10.390
and she doesn't want anybody
to know, especially Rogelio.

13:10.423 --> 13:11.992
Well, why doesn't she want
to tell Rogelio?

13:12.025 --> 13:13.060
She doesn't think
he can handle it.

13:13.093 --> 13:15.028
Of course he can.
No kidding. That's what I said.

13:15.062 --> 13:16.029
(Mateo fusses)

13:16.063 --> 13:18.165
Okay, Mr. Sweetface...

13:18.198 --> 13:19.833
you and I are gonna
go take a bath.

13:19.867 --> 13:20.868
You are officially
on the clock,

13:20.901 --> 13:22.535
'cause tonight,
you are sleeping!

13:22.569 --> 13:24.271
I found a great method.

13:24.304 --> 13:27.007
And you took a nice bath.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.376
And you got your
cute jammies on.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.178
And here's your lovey.

13:31.211 --> 13:35.148
Yes. And now I'm
going to rock him

13:35.182 --> 13:38.018
until he's drowsy
but not asleep,

13:38.051 --> 13:40.453
and then I'm going to
put him in his crib.

13:45.058 --> 13:46.326
Yes.

13:46.359 --> 13:48.862
I do this now, and then,

13:48.896 --> 13:50.163
every time he wakes up,

13:50.197 --> 13:51.564
I give him
a little less comfort,

13:51.598 --> 13:53.166
so by the end of the night,

13:53.200 --> 13:55.235
all he needs is a pat
to go to sleep.

14:02.209 --> 14:04.077
You see?

14:04.111 --> 14:06.479
(Mateo crying)

14:12.219 --> 14:14.054
Good evening, folks,
I'm John Salley.

14:14.087 --> 14:15.188
And I'm Lee Reherman.

14:15.222 --> 14:17.190
And welcome to
 Sleep Tonight.

14:17.224 --> 14:19.059
And tonight, Team Villanueva

14:19.092 --> 14:20.427
is going to attempt

14:20.460 --> 14:21.628
gentle sleep learning.

14:21.661 --> 14:24.064
Oh...

14:24.097 --> 14:26.399
Okay...

14:26.433 --> 14:28.168
LEE: So it's early in
the first quarter, John.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.337
And it looks like
she's going to go

14:30.370 --> 14:32.605
with the kissing
and rocking combo.

14:32.639 --> 14:33.673
Let's see if it works.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.308
All right.

14:41.448 --> 14:43.216
(Mateo crying)

14:45.385 --> 14:47.220
Okay... okay...
(crying continues)

14:47.254 --> 14:48.355
You see here, Lee?

14:48.388 --> 14:51.658
Villanueva has the lovey
placed just so.

14:51.691 --> 14:53.260
Now she slides
a pacifier in.

14:53.293 --> 14:54.561
LEE: Oh, that's
straight butter!

14:54.594 --> 14:57.164
Now she's patting
his back gently.

14:57.197 --> 14:58.298
Do not count Villanueva out.

14:58.331 --> 14:59.399
No way.

14:59.432 --> 15:00.600
(door creaks)

15:03.536 --> 15:06.106
(Mateo cries)

15:06.139 --> 15:08.608
And a typical
rookie mistake, John!

15:08.641 --> 15:10.343
I'm with Alba on this one.

15:10.377 --> 15:11.711
She's got the experience
and the know-how.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.380
(Mateo crying)
We are definitely going

15:13.413 --> 15:14.614
into overtime tonight.

15:14.647 --> 15:15.682
(yawns)

15:20.553 --> 15:23.056
PETRA:
 How do you sleep at night?

15:23.090 --> 15:24.992
Sleeping pills.

15:25.025 --> 15:26.526
I have a prescription.

15:26.559 --> 15:27.660
I'm serious.

15:27.694 --> 15:30.263
Because I am a survivor, Petra.

15:30.297 --> 15:32.399
And I raise you to be one, too.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.467
Which is why you
will get through this.

15:34.501 --> 15:35.535
I promise.

15:35.568 --> 15:37.404
Mother, stop!

15:37.437 --> 15:41.374
I can't go to jail
for something I didn't do!

15:41.408 --> 15:43.410
You know what really
happened that night.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.644
I walked in.

15:44.677 --> 15:46.980
You were standing over
Ivan's body.

15:47.014 --> 15:48.215
Your hook was bloody!

15:48.248 --> 15:50.083
And here is what I know.

15:50.117 --> 15:51.418
There is a recorder

15:51.451 --> 15:53.553
hidden somewhere in this room.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.288
So I will speak
loudly enough:

15:55.322 --> 15:58.091
Stop lying, Petra.

15:58.125 --> 16:01.428
Admit what you did.

16:04.197 --> 16:05.198
(door closes)

16:15.342 --> 16:16.343
(yawning loudly)

16:18.478 --> 16:20.313
Okay, new plan.

16:20.347 --> 16:21.581
It's called "gentle,
independent sleep,"

16:21.614 --> 16:24.717
and I watched a whole video
on it last night.

16:24.751 --> 16:26.186
PERKY INSTRUCTOR (on video):
First, we say good night,

16:26.219 --> 16:27.254
and remember, be peppy,

16:27.287 --> 16:30.623
so little Leo knows
that it's going to be okay.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.459
So, you leave him and you
check in in five minutes.

16:32.492 --> 16:33.326
And then you check in
in ten minutes

16:33.360 --> 16:34.461
and then you check in
in 15 minutes

16:34.494 --> 16:35.462
until he falls asleep,

16:35.495 --> 16:37.064
and then he doesn't feel
like you abandoned him.

16:37.097 --> 16:38.098
What do you think?

16:42.669 --> 16:44.471
(gasps) Ma!

16:44.504 --> 16:46.273
I'm sorry, I'm too
exhausted to keep secrets.

16:46.306 --> 16:47.740
She won't say anything.
Mm-mm.

16:47.774 --> 16:49.442
Ay...

16:59.786 --> 17:02.389
Trust me,
I know how difficult this is.

17:02.422 --> 17:03.390
You don't.

17:03.423 --> 17:04.491
If you did, you wouldn't be

17:04.523 --> 17:05.791
asking me these questions

17:05.825 --> 17:07.260
that I don't have
the answer to.

17:07.294 --> 17:09.096
We're just looking
for anything.

17:09.128 --> 17:11.731
And I was only six years old
the last time I saw my mom.

17:11.763 --> 17:13.400
(sighs)

17:13.433 --> 17:15.068
Look, I know
what it feels like

17:15.102 --> 17:17.104
to try to remember
someone.

17:18.671 --> 17:21.674
My father left us
when I was about five.

17:23.476 --> 17:25.244
All my memories of him...

17:26.445 --> 17:28.648
...well, I don't know
if they're real.

17:28.681 --> 17:30.650
Or from pictures...

17:30.683 --> 17:33.153
or from what
my mom told me.

17:34.454 --> 17:36.589
But anything
you can remember...
(sighs)

17:36.623 --> 17:39.326
no matter how small
the detail...

17:41.428 --> 17:43.230
...well, it could help.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.569
Are you trying to use
the fact that I like you

17:49.602 --> 17:51.371
to try and get me
to trust you?

17:51.404 --> 17:53.473
A little bit, yes.

17:53.506 --> 17:55.175
(laughing)

17:55.208 --> 17:57.244
We need to find
your mother, Luisa.

17:57.277 --> 17:59.646
Is there anything
you can remember?

17:59.679 --> 18:01.681
Anything at all?

18:03.550 --> 18:04.717
(groans)

18:09.722 --> 18:12.559
(voice breaking): I remember
that she was beautiful

18:12.592 --> 18:17.830
and... I remember the story
that she used to tell me

18:17.864 --> 18:20.700
about this lake
with magic fish.

18:20.733 --> 18:21.734
A lake?

18:22.835 --> 18:24.437
There's something
in her file

18:24.471 --> 18:26.439
about a magical lake.

18:26.473 --> 18:28.341
"Bioluminescent organisms
in the water

18:28.375 --> 18:30.610
create a glow under
the surface"!

18:30.643 --> 18:32.579
So the magic fish are real?

18:32.612 --> 18:35.582
SUSANNA:
Longbourne Lagoon.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.450
See? A lead!

18:37.484 --> 18:39.719
JANE:
 But then Elizabeth Bennet

18:39.752 --> 18:40.820
takes the lead,

18:40.853 --> 18:43.423
outmaneuvering the powerful
Lady Catherine de Bourgh

18:43.456 --> 18:44.724
in the final pages,

18:44.757 --> 18:46.593
and that is why
 Pride and Prejudice

18:46.626 --> 18:49.562
is just like the
George Mason-UConn matchup

18:49.596 --> 18:51.731
in the 2006 NCAA tournament--
boom!

18:51.764 --> 18:52.832
(cheering, class bell rings)

18:52.865 --> 18:53.633
Yeah!
Oh, oh, okay!

18:53.666 --> 18:55.368
This was a
good class today, guys!

18:55.402 --> 18:57.604
Don't forget to turn in
your paper on your way out!

18:57.637 --> 19:00.607
(indistinct conversations)

19:01.741 --> 19:04.211
Matt... Matt?

19:04.244 --> 19:05.278
McBaskets?

19:05.912 --> 19:07.380
Your paper?

19:07.414 --> 19:10.350
Oh. Yeah.
I didn't do it.

19:10.383 --> 19:11.718
Big game Saturday.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.653
Any chance you'd cut me
some slack this time?

19:15.622 --> 19:16.423
I'll give you
a one-day extension.

19:16.456 --> 19:18.591
But you have to have it
in my in-box

19:18.625 --> 19:20.227
at the end of the day tomorrow.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.463
Wow.
(laughs nervously)

19:23.496 --> 19:24.864
You're killing me, Prof.

19:24.897 --> 19:26.866
ROGELIO:
 My father is dying.

19:26.899 --> 19:28.301
What-what do you mean?

19:28.335 --> 19:29.969
I mean, think about it.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.838
He was too ill to travel.

19:31.871 --> 19:34.441
And I can't even bring him up
to my mother without her

19:34.474 --> 19:35.475
changing the subject.

19:35.508 --> 19:36.843
(door opens, closes)

19:36.876 --> 19:38.911
Clearly, he is dying.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.813
Who is dying?
His dad.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.282
He thinks.

19:42.315 --> 19:43.716
I'm not ready
to lose him.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.618
But I must stay strong.

19:45.652 --> 19:46.753
I have to help my father

19:46.786 --> 19:49.222
achieve everything
on his bucket list.

19:49.256 --> 19:51.924
I have to make sure he gets
to see Bette Midler in concert.

19:51.958 --> 19:54.627
And Wick on Broadway.

19:54.661 --> 19:58.265
He always wanted
to vacation in Mykonos.

19:58.298 --> 20:01.534
A place in Provincetown
might not be feasible,

20:01.568 --> 20:03.336
given my current
budget, but...

20:03.370 --> 20:04.937
Dad...

20:04.971 --> 20:07.607
Manuel is not dying.

20:07.640 --> 20:08.908
He is gay.

20:08.941 --> 20:10.977
And he's leaving
Glamma for a man,

20:11.010 --> 20:12.945
and that's why she's
been acting so weird.

20:12.979 --> 20:13.946
Gay?

20:13.980 --> 20:15.548
Wait...

20:15.582 --> 20:16.583
(snorts)

20:16.616 --> 20:18.651
But... but that's impossible.

20:18.685 --> 20:21.254
Surely there would have
been some sign.

20:28.428 --> 20:29.696
It is true.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.030
Wow.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.499
And he's leaving
my mother.

20:32.532 --> 20:34.867
And why did she tell you all,
and not me?

20:34.901 --> 20:36.969
Well, she didn't tell
all of us, just me.

20:37.003 --> 20:37.904
And, for some reason,

20:37.937 --> 20:39.672
she didn't think that
you could handle it.

20:39.706 --> 20:40.673
What?!

20:40.707 --> 20:42.642
Everybody knows how
gay-friendly I am-- please.

20:42.675 --> 20:44.377
I was on the cover
of Ou magazine

20:44.411 --> 20:46.713
in an issue that also
featured my very suggestive

20:46.746 --> 20:48.848
editorial spread with
Neil Patrick Harris!

20:48.881 --> 20:50.817
(gasps)

20:50.850 --> 20:53.720
I must convince her
of this.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.788
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Methinks a plan is afoot.

20:55.822 --> 20:59.025
But first, this plan.

20:59.058 --> 21:02.495
Okay... good night, Mateo.

21:02.529 --> 21:03.530
(Mateo grunts)

21:03.563 --> 21:05.398
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Remember, peppy, Jane.

21:05.432 --> 21:06.866
Show him no fear.

21:06.899 --> 21:10.069
You're gonna do
a great job falling asleep.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.471
Hello, everybody,

21:11.504 --> 21:12.672
and welcome to the Sleeper Bowl!

21:12.705 --> 21:13.873
It is the biggest night

21:13.906 --> 21:15.675
of the sleep training season.

21:15.708 --> 21:16.743
JOHN:
 Tonight,

21:16.776 --> 21:17.877
the Villanueva team's strategy

21:17.910 --> 21:19.379
is a modified Cry It Out.

21:19.412 --> 21:20.980
The question is, Lee,
do you think

21:21.013 --> 21:22.982
they can make it work?
Well, they'll have to.

21:23.015 --> 21:24.884
And this first play is crucial.

21:24.917 --> 21:28.621
Jane needs to stay out of
Mateo's room for five minutes.

21:28.655 --> 21:31.791
JOHN: Luckily, she has
 a strong defense...

21:31.824 --> 21:34.594
(Mateo crying)

21:34.627 --> 21:36.896
...and a deep bench
 to support her.

21:36.929 --> 21:39.999
*

21:40.032 --> 21:43.069
(Mateo wails)

21:43.102 --> 21:45.037
You need a distraction.

21:45.071 --> 21:47.540
Let's look up
Michael's girlfriend.

21:47.574 --> 21:49.742
JANE: Is that her?
XIOMARA:
I think it's her.

21:49.776 --> 21:51.511
You think or you know?

21:51.544 --> 21:53.746
No, I know.
(Mateo crying loudly)

21:53.780 --> 21:55.682
He's okay,
he's okay.
Mm-hmm.

21:55.715 --> 21:57.384
(thump)
What was that?

22:00.653 --> 22:02.622
What?
Oh, my God, let me see...

22:02.655 --> 22:03.956
LEE: Villanueva's been
staying on the sidelines,

22:03.990 --> 22:05.825
letting Mateo
run his own play.

22:05.858 --> 22:07.460
But he's struggling.

22:07.494 --> 22:08.861
(Mateo crying)
Okay, that's enough.

22:10.863 --> 22:14.901
And in the final moments,
 there she is, stepping in!

22:14.934 --> 22:16.836
JOHN AND LEE: Oh!
(buzzer sounds)

22:16.869 --> 22:18.838
JOHN: Man, and that will do it
 for Villanueva.

22:18.871 --> 22:20.507
Tough loss for this team.

22:20.540 --> 22:21.708
Back to square one, Lee.

22:21.741 --> 22:22.742
ALBA:
 Jane.

22:24.043 --> 22:25.512
He wasn't, he hit his head.

22:29.616 --> 22:31.918
What?

22:31.951 --> 22:33.753
Oh, no, no, no,
not Mommy's compu...

22:33.786 --> 22:34.821
(computer dings)

22:37.790 --> 22:38.758
JOHN AND LEE:
 Oh!

22:38.791 --> 22:39.992
No!
That's gotta hurt!

22:40.026 --> 22:40.993
Oh, God.

22:41.027 --> 22:42.729
All right, that's for
the blooper reel, Lee.

22:42.762 --> 22:44.764
Let's see it again,
but in slow motion.

22:44.797 --> 22:48.034
*

22:49.769 --> 22:51.003
Put a fork in her.

22:51.037 --> 22:52.038
Carry her off the court.

22:52.071 --> 22:53.773
Jane Villanueva

22:53.806 --> 22:56.643
is done.

23:02.882 --> 23:05.918
You didn't save me any?
Sorry.

23:05.952 --> 23:08.387
Sorry. I'm trying to get it
together to teach.

23:18.130 --> 23:19.499
Stop obsessing.

23:19.532 --> 23:21.033
You canceled it in time.

23:21.067 --> 23:22.101
Unless she gets notifications
on her phone.

23:22.134 --> 23:23.870
In which case she'll see
my name, know I'm his ex,

23:23.903 --> 23:25.071
and think I'm a creepy stalker.

23:25.104 --> 23:26.473
Maybe she's not
his girlfriend.

23:26.506 --> 23:28.074
Maybe they're just friends.

23:28.107 --> 23:29.942
Who cares?
If she's his friend,

23:29.976 --> 23:31.210
she'll warn her friend Michael

23:31.243 --> 23:33.112
that his ex is a creepy stalker.

23:33.145 --> 23:35.648
Either way, Jane Villanueva
equals creepy stalker.

23:39.586 --> 23:41.020
Abuela...

23:41.053 --> 23:42.221
You don't think I know that?

23:42.254 --> 23:43.990
I was actually thinking

23:44.023 --> 23:46.559
that he'd sleep with me a while.

23:46.593 --> 23:48.561
Yeah, just until he gets over
this sleep regression.

23:48.595 --> 23:50.563
Look, I tried
a little crying,

23:50.597 --> 23:52.565
because you said to,
but I can't do it.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.101
Because it's so selfish!

23:56.268 --> 23:57.637
It's for me.

23:57.670 --> 23:58.838
It's so I'm well-rested

23:58.871 --> 24:00.172
and so I can
go to school and teach,

24:00.206 --> 24:02.141
which is also for me.

24:02.174 --> 24:04.176
Don't you think
I should do something for him?

24:04.210 --> 24:06.178
Hon, stop.

24:06.212 --> 24:07.980
You do so much.

24:08.014 --> 24:10.883
I just feel like
I've been choosing myself a lot.

24:12.719 --> 24:14.587
And I feel guilty.

24:26.633 --> 24:28.234
What?

24:32.004 --> 24:34.073
I am plenty tough.

24:34.106 --> 24:35.608
I am!

24:35.642 --> 24:36.843
(phone chimes)

24:36.876 --> 24:38.244
Oh, look. Look at this.

24:38.277 --> 24:40.079
McBaskets made his deadline.

24:40.112 --> 24:41.981
It's probably because
I've been so firm with him.

24:42.014 --> 24:42.982
Hmm.

24:43.015 --> 24:45.552
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Great.

24:45.585 --> 24:47.587
Let's have a quick look,
 shall we?

24:49.889 --> 24:52.725
Your paper is plagiarized.

24:52.759 --> 24:53.993
What?

24:54.026 --> 24:56.162
Oh, I-I didn't know.

24:56.195 --> 24:58.865
You didn't know
you plagiarized your paper?

24:58.898 --> 25:01.133
From a famous paper,
by the way.

25:01.167 --> 25:03.135
In fact, when I was in college,

25:03.169 --> 25:05.905
I wrote a paper
about this very paper.

25:05.938 --> 25:08.307
Well, I was, like,
inspired by it.

25:08.340 --> 25:09.776
Inspired to copy it?

25:09.809 --> 25:11.911
Okay, fine.

25:11.944 --> 25:13.980
You win.
I'll... I'll take a do-over.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.615
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 It should be noted

25:15.648 --> 25:17.283
that on another,
 more well-rested day,

25:17.316 --> 25:19.652
Jane might have been inclined
 to grant his request.

25:19.686 --> 25:21.120
No. You'll take an "F."

25:21.153 --> 25:23.956
But alas,
 this was not that day.

25:23.990 --> 25:26.258
Hey, no way. If you fail me,
I won't be able to play.

25:26.292 --> 25:28.327
Well, you should have
thought about that before.

25:28.360 --> 25:29.662
Are you serious?

25:29.696 --> 25:31.130
MAN:
 Yup.

25:33.800 --> 25:34.967
I remember her.

25:35.001 --> 25:36.936
Lived in an old house
by the river.

25:36.969 --> 25:38.571
Kept to herself.

25:38.605 --> 25:40.807
You're sure it's her?
Yup.

25:40.840 --> 25:43.009
Not too many people around here.

25:43.042 --> 25:45.678
When did you
see her last?

25:49.782 --> 25:51.584
They're offering me a plea.

25:51.618 --> 25:52.785
18 months.

25:52.819 --> 25:54.153
I'll be out in 14.

25:54.186 --> 25:55.354
But there is

25:55.387 --> 25:57.757
a 24-hour clock on this offer.

25:57.790 --> 26:00.593
So maybe... maybe I should...

26:00.627 --> 26:02.629
Should just plead guilty
to something you didn't do?

26:02.662 --> 26:04.296
No, absolutely not.
What's my
alternative?

26:04.330 --> 26:05.798
Go to trial?

26:05.832 --> 26:07.667
Risk a long sentence?
I'll find you

26:07.700 --> 26:09.268
a new attorney,
a better attorney.

26:09.301 --> 26:11.904
She's the best.
Not if she's
asking you to plead.

26:11.938 --> 26:13.673
That's ridiculous.

26:13.706 --> 26:14.907
I'm sorry.

26:14.941 --> 26:17.143
I'm just...

26:17.176 --> 26:18.344
This is crazy.

26:18.377 --> 26:19.779
I know.

26:21.948 --> 26:23.282
Are you okay?

26:23.315 --> 26:25.685
Yeah, I'm fine.

26:25.718 --> 26:26.886
(exhales)

26:26.919 --> 26:28.220
Just a little dizzy.

26:28.254 --> 26:30.589
When was the last time you ate?

26:31.958 --> 26:33.092
Yeah, see, if you have
to think about it,

26:33.125 --> 26:34.226
it's been too long.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.095
What do you want?

26:36.128 --> 26:38.698
For my last meal?
No. For dinner.

26:38.731 --> 26:41.233
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Ah, yes... dinner.

26:41.267 --> 26:42.769
And Luca and I met

26:42.802 --> 26:45.204
while I was working
at the Marbella.

26:45.237 --> 26:47.106
It's nice to meet you.
You, too.

26:47.139 --> 26:49.909
I happen to be a huge fan
of Luca... and Byron's.

26:49.942 --> 26:52.011
Nice to meet you, Liliana.
Thank you.

26:56.716 --> 26:58.384
I needed some spiritual guidance
after I broke up with

26:58.417 --> 27:00.386
my partner of 25 years.

27:00.419 --> 27:01.854
Here's some
spiritual guidance.

27:01.888 --> 27:03.122
Enjoy being single.

27:03.155 --> 27:04.857
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Wait a minute.

27:04.891 --> 27:06.392
There's something queer
 about this dinner.

27:06.425 --> 27:11.063
Oh, good, Ricky Martin
might stop by for dessert.

27:11.097 --> 27:12.431
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Ah, I see.

27:12.464 --> 27:14.000
A big gay dinner
 to show Liliana

27:14.033 --> 27:15.401
how gay-friendly he is.

27:15.434 --> 27:16.803
So, should we eat?

27:18.905 --> 27:21.741
Allow me, please, Alba.

27:21.774 --> 27:22.942
Dear Heavenly Father,

27:22.975 --> 27:24.677
thank you for making the world

27:24.711 --> 27:26.312
such a beautifully
diverse place,

27:26.345 --> 27:28.147
filled with all kinds of people

27:28.180 --> 27:30.282
who love whoever they want.

27:30.316 --> 27:32.051
Like men who love women,

27:32.084 --> 27:33.686
women who love women,

27:33.720 --> 27:36.222
men who love men...

27:36.255 --> 27:38.958
Oh, no... you told him?

27:38.991 --> 27:40.693
Way to be subtle.

27:40.727 --> 27:42.762
I don't want to be subtle.
I'm sorry, Glamma.

27:42.795 --> 27:44.163
No, don't-don't be mad at Jane.

27:44.196 --> 27:46.032
I thought my dad was sick.

27:46.065 --> 27:47.433
Why didn't you tell me, Mother?

27:47.466 --> 27:48.434
I-I couldn't.

27:48.467 --> 27:49.802
But... no, I don't understand.

27:49.836 --> 27:51.037
Why didn't you tell me?

27:51.070 --> 27:52.238
Because!

27:54.473 --> 27:58.177
Because he promised
not to tell anyone

27:58.210 --> 28:00.379
until I broke the news to you.

28:00.412 --> 28:02.915
And so now,
telling you means that

28:02.949 --> 28:04.984
he tells everyone,

28:05.017 --> 28:06.418
he moves out,

28:06.452 --> 28:08.220
it actually happens,

28:08.254 --> 28:11.257
and my husband of 47 years

28:11.290 --> 28:13.125
is leaving me.

28:13.159 --> 28:14.160
Mother...

28:15.427 --> 28:17.329
I need some air.

28:17.363 --> 28:20.066
I'm sorry.

28:28.340 --> 28:30.342
*

28:34.113 --> 28:36.849
47 years.

28:36.883 --> 28:39.018
All a lie.

28:39.051 --> 28:41.120
I'm sure that's not true.

28:41.153 --> 28:43.289
I feel like a fool.

28:43.322 --> 28:44.490
No.

28:44.523 --> 28:46.292
No, you're not, Mom.

28:46.325 --> 28:47.493
You didn't know.

28:47.526 --> 28:49.028
I mean, none of us did.

28:49.061 --> 28:51.363
I just wish
you told me,

28:51.397 --> 28:52.999
instead of making me stage

28:53.032 --> 28:56.068
a ridiculous dinner
with a random...

28:56.102 --> 28:57.837
Hey, guys.

28:57.870 --> 28:59.071
Thanks for coming.

28:59.105 --> 29:00.306
Real honor.

29:05.344 --> 29:07.446
Are you okay?

29:07.479 --> 29:09.348
Oh, I'm terrified.

29:09.381 --> 29:11.851
I moved in with your father

29:11.884 --> 29:14.120
right out of my parents' house.

29:18.557 --> 29:20.993
I have never been alone.

29:21.027 --> 29:24.130
You're not alone, Mom.

29:24.163 --> 29:25.932
You're not.

29:25.965 --> 29:27.533
I promise.

29:27.566 --> 29:29.368
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Aw.

29:29.401 --> 29:30.937
There's nothing like the bond

29:30.970 --> 29:32.805
between mother and child.

29:32.839 --> 29:35.374
(Mateo crying)

29:35.407 --> 29:36.475
You promise?

29:36.508 --> 29:38.510
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Right?

29:42.148 --> 29:44.851
However, sometimes that bond
 goes horribly wrong.

29:44.884 --> 29:47.386
Lucky that the one thing
I know how to make

29:47.419 --> 29:48.988
is the one thing
you're really craving.

29:49.021 --> 29:51.190
(phone ringing)

29:53.292 --> 29:54.260
Your mother?

29:54.293 --> 29:55.261
She calls every day now.

29:55.294 --> 29:56.829
I haven't called her back.

29:56.863 --> 29:58.865
I thought you were ready
to hear the whole story.

29:58.898 --> 30:01.367
Why she took $10 million
to walk away from me?

30:01.400 --> 30:03.269
You know, the more
that I think about it,

30:03.302 --> 30:04.536
what could she possibly say?

30:04.570 --> 30:07.573
Well, you don't know.
Right?

30:09.408 --> 30:11.410
Look, at a certain point,

30:11.443 --> 30:14.914
under certain pressures...

30:14.947 --> 30:16.448
I might have
taken money like that.

30:18.050 --> 30:20.419
And I'm not a bad person.

30:20.452 --> 30:22.154
Right?

30:22.188 --> 30:25.124
No. You're not.

30:25.157 --> 30:26.926
Besides, she can't possibly
be as bad as my mom.

30:26.959 --> 30:29.495
You have a point there.

30:34.433 --> 30:36.435
I'm sorry,
do you have to do that?

30:36.468 --> 30:37.937
You're kind of holding
the murder weapon.

30:37.970 --> 30:39.338
Not really. New ones.

30:39.371 --> 30:41.173
These have an "M."

30:41.207 --> 30:42.308
No, it had an "M."

30:42.341 --> 30:43.609
I saw the picture.

30:43.642 --> 30:45.044
Wait.

30:45.077 --> 30:47.079
Are you sure?

30:47.113 --> 30:48.881
Petra, this is new cutlery.

30:48.915 --> 30:50.883
It came in just before
the Christmas party.

30:50.917 --> 30:52.484
After Ivan was killed?

30:52.518 --> 30:54.186
Yes. Definitely.

30:54.220 --> 30:55.521
(Mateo crying)
Definitely?

30:57.356 --> 30:59.358
(phone ringing)

31:01.593 --> 31:02.929
Hello?

31:02.962 --> 31:04.296
Jane, hi.

31:04.330 --> 31:05.932
I'm sorry to bother you
at night.

31:05.965 --> 31:06.966
No, no, no, that's okay,
what's going on?

31:06.999 --> 31:08.567
I was calling about a student

31:08.600 --> 31:10.236
in your class, Mr. McNeil.

31:10.269 --> 31:11.971
I'm hearing he plagiarized.

31:12.004 --> 31:13.372
Oh, uh, yeah.

31:13.405 --> 31:14.941
Was I supposed to report that?

31:14.974 --> 31:16.608
No, no, not at all.
Here's the thing.

31:16.642 --> 31:20.079
I was wondering
if there's any way

31:20.112 --> 31:21.948
he can have a second chance.

31:21.981 --> 31:25.051
Uh... that was
his second chance.

31:25.084 --> 31:26.919
I gave him an extension
and then he plagiarized.

31:26.953 --> 31:28.120
I know.

31:28.154 --> 31:30.256
I agree.

31:30.289 --> 31:33.125
But... this is
a complicated situation.

31:33.159 --> 31:36.395
There's the reality of
university politics to consider.

31:36.428 --> 31:37.930
Excuse me?

31:37.964 --> 31:40.566
Donors like to win
basketball games.

31:40.599 --> 31:42.234
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Oh, my God!

31:42.268 --> 31:43.970
This perfectly
 encapsulates what's wrong

31:44.003 --> 31:45.537
with higher education--
 privileging athletics

31:45.571 --> 31:47.406
and alumni contributions
 over academic rigor!

31:47.439 --> 31:49.041
Look, I hate this.

31:49.075 --> 31:51.110
And I'm not asking you
to give McBaskets--

31:51.143 --> 31:54.313
Mr. McNeil-- a free pass.

31:54.346 --> 31:56.348
Just one more shot.

31:56.382 --> 31:57.483
So to speak.

31:57.516 --> 31:59.952
Inspire him to do the paper.

31:59.986 --> 32:02.088
Yeah, okay, I'll try.

32:04.023 --> 32:05.257
He basically wants me to give

32:05.291 --> 32:06.492
the basketball player
a free pass.

32:06.525 --> 32:08.394
Seriously?
Seriously.

32:12.364 --> 32:15.134
Oh, my God.

32:16.235 --> 32:17.536
Oh, my God!
Shh!

32:19.305 --> 32:21.240
(quietly cheering)

32:21.273 --> 32:22.408
(laughs)

32:22.441 --> 32:24.210
And it looks
like the Villanuevas

32:24.243 --> 32:26.545
have pulled
the upset of the year!

32:26.578 --> 32:28.580
This one is going down
 in the record books.

32:37.189 --> 32:39.025
JANE:
Uh, Matt?

32:39.058 --> 32:40.126
Hey, you talk
to Professor Blake?

32:40.159 --> 32:40.959
I did.
Cool.

32:40.993 --> 32:43.162
Oh, a-and if you want
that "F" removed

32:43.195 --> 32:44.430
so you can play tomorrow,
you're gonna have

32:44.463 --> 32:45.697
to write a new paper... today.

32:45.731 --> 32:47.033
Didn't Professor Blake

32:47.066 --> 32:48.667
tell you to give me a break?

32:48.700 --> 32:51.403
No, he suggested
I give you a break.
Yeah.

32:51.437 --> 32:53.139
You know,
for an English teacher,

32:53.172 --> 32:55.141
I don't really think
you understand nuance.

32:55.174 --> 32:57.376
I'm not doing you any favors
by giving you a free pass.

32:57.409 --> 32:59.711
Actually, you would be
doing me a huge favor by...

32:59.745 --> 33:01.113
Not in the long run.

33:01.147 --> 33:02.781
Come on, no speeches, okay?

33:02.814 --> 33:04.383
I'm not a writer.
I'm never gonna be.

33:04.416 --> 33:06.585
I'm not saying
you have to be a writer.

33:06.618 --> 33:08.220
But you do have skills

33:08.254 --> 33:09.721
that would improve
with a little hard work.

33:09.755 --> 33:11.323
I mean, why won't you even try?

33:11.357 --> 33:12.591
Because who wants
to spend time

33:12.624 --> 33:14.260
doing something
they aren't good at?

33:14.293 --> 33:15.461
I don't see you out there
on the court

33:15.494 --> 33:16.495
playing basketball.

33:17.663 --> 33:19.198
Try me.

33:19.231 --> 33:21.333
You serious?

33:21.367 --> 33:22.768
I make a basket,

33:22.801 --> 33:24.403
you have to sit down
and write the paper.

33:24.436 --> 33:26.372
For real?

33:26.405 --> 33:27.673
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 No, not for real.

33:27.706 --> 33:30.509
Yes, let's do it.

33:30.542 --> 33:32.644
Let's do it.

33:32.678 --> 33:35.147
(muttering)

33:41.453 --> 33:43.222
One basket,
you write the paper.

33:43.255 --> 33:45.391
One basket,
I'll write you that paper.

33:48.660 --> 33:50.229
Oh!

33:50.262 --> 33:51.497
(players clamoring)

33:51.530 --> 33:52.631
(Jane grunting)

33:52.664 --> 33:54.400
Ooh!

33:59.371 --> 34:00.506
(chuckles)
Traveling.
(horn blaring)

34:00.539 --> 34:02.141
Double dribble.

34:02.174 --> 34:03.275
That's reaching in.

34:03.309 --> 34:05.111
It wasn't that much of a foul!

34:05.144 --> 34:07.113
(grunting)

34:07.146 --> 34:08.679
(groans)

34:08.714 --> 34:10.616
STUDENT:
Take it back!

34:10.649 --> 34:12.384
Come on, teach!

34:12.418 --> 34:14.585
(students clamoring)

34:14.620 --> 34:16.422
Lucky shot.

34:19.858 --> 34:21.726
STUDENT:
Just like that!

34:23.895 --> 34:28.333
(students cheering)

34:28.367 --> 34:29.435
You all right?

34:29.467 --> 34:30.802
Yeah.

34:30.835 --> 34:32.271
I'm good.

34:32.304 --> 34:33.505
Okay.

34:33.539 --> 34:35.407
Let's do it again.

34:35.440 --> 34:36.608
Come on.

34:36.641 --> 34:38.310
Man, I have never seen anyone

34:38.344 --> 34:39.811
as bad at basketball
as you are.

34:39.844 --> 34:41.246
But good effort.

34:41.280 --> 34:43.215
I'm gonna write you that paper.

34:44.616 --> 34:47.518
(grunts)

34:49.888 --> 34:52.090
(students oohing)

34:57.429 --> 34:59.231
(students groan)

35:00.266 --> 35:01.500
Dude, no way

35:01.533 --> 35:02.568
is my paper gonna suck

35:02.601 --> 35:04.236
as much as you do
at basketball.

35:04.270 --> 35:05.671
Let's hope not.

35:05.704 --> 35:07.839
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 At last, a victory.

35:07.873 --> 35:10.276
Which Petra could use
 right about now.

35:10.309 --> 35:12.411
You did the right thing,
taking the plea.

35:12.444 --> 35:14.646
You'll get out in a year, tops.

35:14.680 --> 35:17.416
Well, actually it's
a different plea,

35:17.449 --> 35:18.450
the one that I took.

35:18.484 --> 35:19.351
One that involves no time.

35:19.385 --> 35:20.652
Because I turned you in.

35:21.953 --> 35:24.290
The murder weapon
arrived at the hotel

35:24.323 --> 35:25.924
after Ivan was killed.

35:25.957 --> 35:28.394
Which means you
falsified evidence.

35:28.427 --> 35:29.861
I'm hoping murder charges
will follow.

35:29.895 --> 35:33.265
Magda Andel, you have
the right to remain silent.

35:33.299 --> 35:35.701
Anything you say
can be used...

35:35.734 --> 35:37.803
Wrong choice.

35:37.836 --> 35:39.571
It should be noted
 that these words

35:39.605 --> 35:41.940
will come back to haunt Petra.

35:41.973 --> 35:44.210
But you don't know that yet.

35:44.243 --> 35:45.811
Pretend you don't know that.

35:45.844 --> 35:47.179
It's over.

35:47.213 --> 35:49.515
Thank you.

35:50.982 --> 35:52.484
BOTH:
Oh.

35:52.518 --> 35:53.719
No.
(laughs)

35:53.752 --> 35:55.321
Come here.

35:55.354 --> 35:57.723
(both chuckle)

35:59.358 --> 36:02.294
I feel like I'm waking up
from a bad dream.

36:02.328 --> 36:04.763
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And speaking of dreams...

36:06.365 --> 36:08.800
Oh, hey.

36:08.834 --> 36:11.437
Hey.
Thanks for the tree top...

36:11.470 --> 36:12.938
Why did you send a friend
request to my girlfriend?

36:12.971 --> 36:14.940
Your girlfriend?

36:14.973 --> 36:17.743
Yeah.

36:17.776 --> 36:20.212
Oh, Michael, I-I'm so sorry.

36:20.246 --> 36:21.713
My mom saw you
at the Cubano truck,

36:21.747 --> 36:23.782
and I was trying
to distract myself

36:23.815 --> 36:25.217
during sleep training,
and Mateo's

36:25.251 --> 36:26.252
little foot hit the keyboard.

36:26.285 --> 36:27.286
I canceled the request.

36:27.319 --> 36:29.888
I'm so, so sorry.

36:29.921 --> 36:31.890
It's just that
when we saw each other...

36:31.923 --> 36:34.326
Yeah, you didn't want
to keep in touch.

36:34.360 --> 36:36.628
But then you left
the tree topper.

36:36.662 --> 36:37.896
Because it meant a lot
to you and your family.

36:37.929 --> 36:39.365
That's why I didn't knock.

36:39.398 --> 36:42.301
You know, it wasn't about us.

36:42.334 --> 36:44.636
Got it.

36:44.670 --> 36:47.273
Coincidentally, a line
 from Pride and Prejudice

36:47.306 --> 36:49.975
comes to mind here.

36:57.949 --> 36:59.851
That makes sense.

36:59.885 --> 37:03.522
Look, I'm-I'm finally,
you know, happy again.

37:03.555 --> 37:05.557
And I want you
to be happy, too.

37:05.591 --> 37:08.327
I want you to be... happy.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.529
Again, tough love.

37:10.562 --> 37:13.532
Yeah, thanks.

37:13.565 --> 37:15.534
Which was,

37:15.567 --> 37:18.570
it turned out,
 exactly what she needed...

37:20.506 --> 37:22.641
...to move on.

37:26.712 --> 37:30.416
And that night
 she slept like a baby.

37:31.917 --> 37:34.052
A fully sleep-trained one,

37:34.085 --> 37:36.322
which, happily, Mateo was!

37:39.791 --> 37:41.427
I'm proud of you, too, Mateo.

37:41.460 --> 37:43.028
Of course, Rogelio didn't
need sleep training.

37:43.061 --> 37:45.531
When he came out,
he knew how to sleep.

37:45.564 --> 37:46.798
He knew how to suckle.

37:46.832 --> 37:47.833
Mm-hmm.

37:47.866 --> 37:49.401
Okay, I got the paper.

37:49.435 --> 37:51.537
McBaskets actually put
some real work into it.

37:51.570 --> 37:54.039
I mean, it's like
a solid C-minus.

37:54.072 --> 37:55.707
(doorbell rings)
I'll get it.

37:59.978 --> 38:00.846
Jane?

38:00.879 --> 38:03.315
Grandpa?

38:03.349 --> 38:04.950
Dad?

38:09.421 --> 38:10.756
Ah.

38:42.954 --> 38:44.756
Mom?

38:44.790 --> 38:46.658
Is that true?

38:46.692 --> 38:47.793
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Oh, dear.

38:47.826 --> 38:49.361
The marriage plot thickens.

38:49.395 --> 38:51.697
ELENA:
 The story, right.

38:51.730 --> 38:54.966
When I met your father,
I was 24.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.368
I was new to the country.

38:56.402 --> 38:58.837
I worked in his hotel.

38:58.870 --> 39:00.672
I'd heard rumors
about his wife Mia.

39:00.706 --> 39:03.542
How she was mentally unstable.

39:03.575 --> 39:05.511
And after her death...

39:05.544 --> 39:07.112
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Supposed death.

39:07.145 --> 39:09.147
...your father was devastated.

39:09.180 --> 39:12.651
Somehow, he...
fixated on me.

39:12.684 --> 39:14.586
I was flattered,
overwhelmed.

39:14.620 --> 39:16.588
I got married.

39:16.622 --> 39:18.089
I got pregnant.

39:18.123 --> 39:21.860
All in the first year
in this country.

39:21.893 --> 39:25.597
But he was... controlling.

39:25.631 --> 39:27.666
And away all the time.

39:27.699 --> 39:29.501
So, yes, I...

39:29.535 --> 39:31.903
turned to someone else.

39:31.937 --> 39:34.406
And when he found out,

39:34.440 --> 39:37.776
he threatened to destroy me.

39:37.809 --> 39:39.611
I was afraid.

39:39.645 --> 39:40.879
I was young.

39:40.912 --> 39:42.814
Well, you could've
fought harder.

39:42.848 --> 39:44.850
For me.

39:44.883 --> 39:47.118
I know.

39:47.152 --> 39:49.788
I should have.

39:49.821 --> 39:51.957
But I'm here now.

39:51.990 --> 39:54.960
And I'm hoping
it's not too late.

39:54.993 --> 39:57.128
And for them,
 at least, it wasn't.

39:57.162 --> 39:58.730
So, you were right.

39:58.764 --> 40:01.833
Your mother
did love that lake.

40:01.867 --> 40:04.770
When she escaped,
that's where she went.

40:04.803 --> 40:07.673
Apparently,
she had a quiet life.

40:07.706 --> 40:10.008
She died
about eight years ago.

40:10.041 --> 40:11.777
Natural causes.

40:11.810 --> 40:14.179
Preliminary DNA tests
on the body

40:14.212 --> 40:16.014
confirm it.

40:16.047 --> 40:17.816
Which means she couldn't

40:17.849 --> 40:21.086
be Mutter because Mutter's
been active recently.

40:21.119 --> 40:23.822
Well, at least there's that.

40:35.767 --> 40:37.569
But wait.
I can't.

40:37.603 --> 40:39.905
If Mia isn't Mutter,
 then who is?

40:39.938 --> 40:41.106
1983.

40:41.139 --> 40:42.741
That's when Mia disappeared.
That's also when

40:42.774 --> 40:44.476
Emilio's company
purchased Bar Lunara,

40:44.510 --> 40:46.244
which we know is Mutter's
money laundering site.

40:46.277 --> 40:47.846
Yeah, but Mia's dead.

40:47.879 --> 40:48.947
She wasn't the one
hiding money there.

40:48.980 --> 40:50.181
Exactly, because someone else

40:50.215 --> 40:51.817
had access to Emilio's company.

40:51.850 --> 40:53.952
Because something else
happened in 1983.

40:53.985 --> 40:55.186
He remarried.

40:55.220 --> 40:57.923
It's her!

40:57.956 --> 40:59.491
Rafael?

40:59.525 --> 41:00.826
RAFAEL:
Found it.

41:02.227 --> 41:04.796
I'll be right there.

41:10.101 --> 41:13.639
Mutter's signature
was blue silk ties.

41:13.672 --> 41:15.974
No.

41:20.211 --> 41:22.113
(grunts)

41:22.147 --> 41:24.550
Where is the
flash drive?

41:24.583 --> 41:26.217
What are you
talking about?

41:26.251 --> 41:28.219
The flash drive
you traded for Mateo.

41:28.253 --> 41:29.955
Who did you give it to?

41:29.988 --> 41:31.823
We gave it to Rose.

41:31.857 --> 41:33.659
No, she doesn't
have it-- who does?

41:33.692 --> 41:35.193
I don't know.

41:35.226 --> 41:38.096
We gave it to her.

41:38.129 --> 41:40.999
Why are you doing this?

41:41.032 --> 41:43.969
What is happening?

41:44.002 --> 41:47.138
