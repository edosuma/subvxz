♪♪

00:06.340 --> 00:08.007
The Statue of Liberty,

00:08.009 --> 00:10.843
the Great Lady of New York
has been speaking loud and clear

00:10.845 --> 00:12.811
since 1885.

00:12.813 --> 00:15.748
Anybody know what
she's trying to say? Maya?

00:19.153 --> 00:21.604
Should I just talk?

00:21.605 --> 00:24.056
No, I'm sick of people thinking
Farkle's smarter than I am.

00:24.058 --> 00:25.724
Here comes fun.

00:25.726 --> 00:27.993
Name one thing about
the Statue of Liberty

00:27.995 --> 00:29.228
that you know
that I don't.

00:29.230 --> 00:30.796
She was a gift
of friendship from...

00:30.798 --> 00:32.798
Cathy.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.299
We got her right after...

00:34.301 --> 00:36.702
Cathy didn't want her anymore.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.070
What does she stand for?

00:38.072 --> 00:40.906
Because Cathy took her chair.

00:42.009 --> 00:45.411
Boy, that Cathy, huh,
what a hoot.

00:45.413 --> 00:47.913
She's not real, genius.
I made her up.

00:47.915 --> 00:51.550
(scoffs)
I'm so smarter than you.

00:51.552 --> 00:54.953
You are.
You really are.

00:58.259 --> 01:00.726
Welcome to Cultural Week,
people.

01:00.728 --> 01:02.828
The school is throwing
a cultural fair

01:02.830 --> 01:06.732
to celebrate who we are
and where we came from.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.434
Anybody here taking part?

01:09.737 --> 01:12.237
My grandma's gonna have a booth
at the fair, Mr. Matthews.

01:12.239 --> 01:13.539
That's great, Nigel.

01:13.541 --> 01:15.074
What culture
will you be celebrating?

01:15.076 --> 01:16.942
She was originally
from Cambodia,

01:16.944 --> 01:19.278
she escaped and lived
in the Philippines,
then she came here.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.779
Did you know that about him?

01:20.781 --> 01:23.615
It surprises me
when any of these guys talk.

01:23.617 --> 01:28.087
And that's exactly what makes
America so unique.

01:28.089 --> 01:31.957
We all come from exotic locales
with fascinating traditions.

01:31.959 --> 01:33.459
Well, where are we from?

01:33.461 --> 01:34.326
Philly.

01:35.463 --> 01:37.396
What's our
fascinating tradition?

01:37.398 --> 01:39.031
Cream cheese.

01:40.401 --> 01:43.102
So I'm the great lady
of cream cheese?

01:43.104 --> 01:45.304
I want a better
tradition, please.

01:45.306 --> 01:47.072
Funny you should say that.

01:47.074 --> 01:48.540
Funny, "haha" funny,

01:48.542 --> 01:51.877
or funny... (groans)
"yay" funny?

01:51.879 --> 01:53.245
Here's your assignment.

01:53.247 --> 01:54.279
(students groan)

01:54.281 --> 01:56.482
Yay!

01:57.451 --> 01:58.784
Everybody look around.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.658
Do we know each other's stories?

02:06.660 --> 02:08.460
Do you know your own?

02:08.462 --> 02:10.963
Our stories are what make us
part of a community.

02:10.965 --> 02:13.665
I want you to come in tomorrow
and share your heritage with us.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.234
Share your story.

02:15.236 --> 02:16.301
Do I even have a story?

02:16.303 --> 02:18.737
You have
a wonderful story, Riley.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.472
It's time you found out
what it is.

(music resumes)

03:30.844 --> 03:32.578
Is that music always playing?

03:32.580 --> 03:34.780
All of a sudden, I'm hearing
the world differently.

03:36.183 --> 03:37.916
So, they're that, what are we?

03:37.918 --> 03:39.851
Hmm. What has your father
done now

03:39.853 --> 03:42.221
that I must pay for?

03:42.223 --> 03:44.523
We need to report on
our cultural heritage.

03:44.525 --> 03:45.724
Ooh, good idea.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.559
Wish we had one.

03:47.561 --> 03:48.860
We're not anything?

03:48.862 --> 03:52.097
We are multi-generational
American.

03:52.099 --> 03:55.067
So I got no story?
What about Auggie?

03:55.069 --> 03:57.502
He's a rescue.
He could be anything.

03:58.872 --> 04:01.340
Honey, there's always a story.
You just have to discover it.

04:01.342 --> 04:03.508
Well, what's the story
with dinner?

04:03.510 --> 04:05.544
-This looks different.
-Maybe to us.

04:05.546 --> 04:08.580
But I bet it makes Auggie's
new friend from school
feel right at home.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.282
-Where's he from?
-He's from Cuba.

04:10.284 --> 04:11.617
I made<i> ropa vieja.</i>

04:11.619 --> 04:13.585
-What's that?
-It means "old clothes."

04:13.587 --> 04:15.921
I don't want
to eat old clo--

04:15.923 --> 04:17.422
<i>Muy bien, Mamá!</i>

04:19.727 --> 04:21.893
It's shredded beef,
tomatoes and veggies,

04:21.895 --> 04:23.595
a very popular Cuban dish.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.564
That's so nice of you, Mom,

04:25.566 --> 04:28.200
making Auggie's little friend
feel more comfortable in
a new, scary place.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.303
(Cuban jazz resumes)

04:32.373 --> 04:33.739
Hey, thanks a lot.

04:33.741 --> 04:35.774
When you visit me,
I'll play "Yankee Doodle."

04:35.776 --> 04:38.977
Well, he doesn't actually
seem scared.

04:38.979 --> 04:41.780
This is my new
best friend, Rafael.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.315
Raffi's from Cuba.

04:43.317 --> 04:45.851
Or as we say
in<i> Cuba, "Cuba."</i>

04:47.321 --> 04:50.822
Wow, something smells
like<i> ropa vieja.</i>

04:50.824 --> 04:52.224
Yay! That's a relief.

04:52.226 --> 04:53.725
Very kind of you.

04:53.727 --> 04:55.560
Thank you.
Smells like home.

04:55.562 --> 04:56.595
It's very good.

04:56.597 --> 04:59.665
You know,
I come from cream cheese.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.401
I hope it was no trouble.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.269
Oh, it was no trouble
at all, Raffi.

05:04.271 --> 05:06.738
Good. I wouldn't want anybody
to go out of their way

05:06.740 --> 05:08.340
just to make me
feel welcome.

05:08.342 --> 05:11.877
(Cuban jazz resumes)

05:23.757 --> 05:26.525
Too much?

05:33.667 --> 05:35.500
Okay, here's my story.

05:35.502 --> 05:39.671
Once upon a time... nothing.
I'm completely American.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.473
My people never even
left the house.

05:41.475 --> 05:43.375
I'm not even cream cheese.

05:43.377 --> 05:45.877
I'm American cheese.
I'm individually wrapped.

05:45.879 --> 05:46.945
Here I come.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.516
Oh, that's the worst
report I ever heard.

05:51.518 --> 05:52.551
Oh, you don't want one?

05:52.553 --> 05:55.354
-No, I do want one.
-You made me this!

05:55.356 --> 05:57.456
Great news, Maya.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.791
Your report couldn't
possibly be any worse.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.193
You don't know me.

06:01.195 --> 06:04.730
Turns out
Clutterbucket is Irish!

06:04.732 --> 06:06.531
I'm Irish.

06:08.135 --> 06:10.569
Know why I'm a short stack
of pancakes, Huckleberry?

06:10.571 --> 06:13.372
'Cause I'm a leprechaun!
Here have a potato!

06:15.309 --> 06:17.676
That's what you brought?
Potatoes?

06:17.678 --> 06:21.546
No, that would be
a stereotypical ignorant cliché.

06:21.548 --> 06:26.318
I also brought
our national soap.

06:26.320 --> 06:30.655
Maya, Ireland has
a rich, deep cultural history.

06:30.657 --> 06:33.058
You show us
something authentic right now!

06:36.730 --> 06:37.763
What are you doing?

06:37.765 --> 06:39.731
I'm gonna Riverdance
all up on Yogi's head.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.099
Do it!

06:42.936 --> 06:44.436
Sit down!

06:45.939 --> 06:48.707
Both of you have just
squandered an opportunity

06:48.709 --> 06:50.242
to show us who you are.

06:50.244 --> 06:52.711
Lucas, Zay,
show us who you are.

06:52.713 --> 06:55.514
You sure about this?

06:55.516 --> 06:57.749
We look good.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.651
-Texas!
-Texas!

07:01.555 --> 07:02.587
Sit down.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.389
You lied to me!

07:04.391 --> 07:07.092
Don't mess with Texas.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.127
You're not from Texas.

07:09.129 --> 07:10.595
He lived right down
the street from me.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.197
You're not from Texas either.

07:12.199 --> 07:14.433
He lived right down
the street from me.

07:14.435 --> 07:15.634
Sit down.

07:17.805 --> 07:20.705
Okay, back to us.

07:20.707 --> 07:23.175
-(playing off-key)
-No!

07:25.145 --> 07:27.379
Bagpipes are Scottish,
not Irish.

07:27.381 --> 07:29.714
Potato potato.

07:31.151 --> 07:33.652
What a bunch of jerks.

07:33.654 --> 07:34.753
-Daddy?
-Leave me alone!

07:34.755 --> 07:35.787
-Daddy?
-No!

07:35.789 --> 07:36.988
-Daddy?
-What?!

07:36.990 --> 07:39.458
You gave me
a stupid story, Daddy.

07:39.460 --> 07:42.561
You all have great stories.

07:42.563 --> 07:45.730
That's what makes this world
such a peaceful place.

07:45.732 --> 07:48.133
No, it's not.
There's conflicts everywhere.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.001
You mean cultures
clash with each other?

07:50.003 --> 07:51.736
Yeah. All through history.

07:51.738 --> 07:53.238
Good boy, Lucas.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.606
Good boy, Lucas.

07:54.608 --> 07:55.640
Maya...

07:55.642 --> 07:56.708
Maya!

07:59.513 --> 08:02.347
There's conflicts
'cause we live in a world full
of different kinds of people.

08:02.349 --> 08:06.084
Right. Unfortunately, people
have always feared the other.

08:06.086 --> 08:07.319
The other what?

08:07.321 --> 08:08.787
The unknown.

08:08.789 --> 08:10.856
Anybody who isn't like you.

08:10.858 --> 08:14.292
From a different country,
a different religion,
a different look.

08:14.294 --> 08:16.795
And our first reaction
to the unknown

08:16.797 --> 08:18.196
has always been fear.

08:18.198 --> 08:20.265
-Farkle.
-Yes, sir?

08:20.267 --> 08:22.667
-Did you do the assignment?
-I did, sir.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.536
Did you find the story
of your ancestors?

08:24.538 --> 08:25.670
I found something out, sir.

08:25.672 --> 08:28.139
Well, Farkle, at least
you have a heritage.

08:28.141 --> 08:31.476
I'm Riley McCheese.
What could be worse than that?

08:31.478 --> 08:33.111
There are worse
things than that, Riley.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.046
You ready to share
something with us, Farkle?

08:35.048 --> 08:37.883
Not yet, sir. I don't have it
all yet. I need to dig deeper.

08:37.885 --> 08:40.385
-More to discover?
-A lot more.

08:40.387 --> 08:43.455
That's the only authentic thing
that's been said today.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.725
We all need to dig deeper

08:46.727 --> 08:49.694
than potatoes and soap
and stupid hats.

08:49.696 --> 08:52.197
How are they stupid hats?

08:52.199 --> 08:55.033
They just don't understand us.

08:55.035 --> 08:58.370
This is a week about
discovering who you are.

08:58.372 --> 09:00.038
This is a week to understand

09:00.040 --> 09:02.908
that culture isn't found
at a souvenir shop.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.243
Riley, what's culture?

09:05.245 --> 09:06.378
Our stories.

09:06.380 --> 09:07.979
Find yours.

09:09.149 --> 09:10.215
Find yours.

09:11.385 --> 09:13.718
Learn from each other.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.620
Otherwise, we don't
stand a chance.

09:23.997 --> 09:26.865
So, Farkle, what's your
big family mystery?

09:26.867 --> 09:29.701
So, turns out I have
a relative from Denmark.

09:29.703 --> 09:32.203
Hey, you're a little Danish.
Little danish?

09:32.205 --> 09:34.005
I've found lots of Minkuses--

09:34.007 --> 09:35.373
"Minki."

09:35.375 --> 09:37.609
Living in Copenhagen,
in Denmark.

09:37.611 --> 09:39.945
The mystery is that I can't
find my great-grandfather's
birth records.

09:39.947 --> 09:43.048
-So?
-So, he was the first
one who left Denmark,

09:43.050 --> 09:45.684
came to America and started
the American "Minki" team.

09:45.686 --> 09:46.952
I want to find out
more about him.

09:46.954 --> 09:48.353
I want to know what
made him come here.

09:48.355 --> 09:51.356
Well, good luck,
detective coffee cake.

09:53.694 --> 09:56.595
Oh, he did? I didn't know that.

09:56.597 --> 09:58.763
My grandmother's telling me
a story about my grandfather.

10:00.067 --> 10:01.099
I just find that terribly--

10:01.101 --> 10:03.134
I am so sorry
that I ate the cookie!

10:03.136 --> 10:05.236
I know that you only made one
for Zay and I ate it.

10:05.238 --> 10:06.638
Please make him
another one.

10:07.808 --> 10:09.975
What?

10:09.977 --> 10:11.209
This is your
other grandmother.

10:11.211 --> 10:12.877
I knew that.

10:12.879 --> 10:14.646
She says that she doesn't
like the cookie bribe,

10:14.648 --> 10:17.148
and you should
love them both the same.

10:17.150 --> 10:19.884
You need to calm
her down right now.

10:19.886 --> 10:22.320
Stay away from
my grandmas, Riley.

10:24.391 --> 10:26.925
Hey, that's a lot of words.
Hey, gotta go.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.994
Yeah, love you, too.

10:28.996 --> 10:30.862
Yes, just as much
as the other one.

10:32.165 --> 10:34.532
No, I don't think that's
okay to say, Grandma.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.702
Thanks for telling me
where I'm from.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.572
We're from Africa!

10:40.574 --> 10:41.973
-Oh...
-What?

10:44.645 --> 10:46.978
Yeah. Feels good
to do the research.

10:48.148 --> 10:51.182
No, for real.
I'm learning my story.

10:51.184 --> 10:52.851
We started out in Ghana.

10:52.853 --> 10:55.320
My grandma says we're lucky
to know where we're from.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.322
Not everyone does.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.591
My family was brought
from Ghana to Jamaica

10:59.593 --> 11:01.192
before we came to America.

11:01.194 --> 11:04.029
We lived in Texas,
and now we live in New York.

11:04.031 --> 11:05.697
Now I'm friends with you.

11:05.699 --> 11:07.866
Well, I look forward
to seeing you every day.

11:07.868 --> 11:10.969
Thanks, Maya.
Happy to be here.

11:10.971 --> 11:13.872
Well, Zay, my family
comes from America,

11:13.874 --> 11:18.009
America, America,
and then America.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.979
And once, I went
to the International
House of Pancakes.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.847
-Hmm. What'd you eat?
-I had a hamburger.

11:22.849 --> 11:25.016
Hmm.

11:25.018 --> 11:28.219
Mom, do you think it's important
to know our history?

11:28.221 --> 11:29.387
What's that you're eating?

11:29.389 --> 11:31.022
Bulochki.

11:31.024 --> 11:31.990
Is there a story behind it?

11:31.992 --> 11:34.025
Well, it makes me think
of Ms. Svorski.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.528
That's why I will
always sell them here.

11:36.530 --> 11:39.064
It helps to remind us
of those who came before us.

11:39.066 --> 11:42.667
Riley, your family
may have been from America
for a long time,

11:42.669 --> 11:44.536
but we have lived
in every part of America,

11:44.538 --> 11:46.805
and we've gotten to experience
all kinds of different cultures.

11:46.807 --> 11:48.339
Where? Who?

11:48.341 --> 11:51.042
Well, your great-grandparents,
they lived in San Francisco.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.877
They got to experience
the Chinese culture.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.179
Your grandparents
lived in Philly,

11:54.181 --> 11:57.148
and we used to go
to Pennsylvania Dutch country.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.917
Respect the people
who came before you.

11:58.919 --> 12:01.419
Always listen to what
they have to say.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.860
Mets, Phillies--
who won the game?

12:08.862 --> 12:11.896
-We lost.
-Kids: We won!

12:11.898 --> 12:13.932
Ava, you caught a foul ball?

12:13.934 --> 12:15.600
It was coming at us
like a rocket.

12:15.602 --> 12:17.001
-I saved his life.
-Auggie?

12:17.003 --> 12:19.070
Cory. Do what you did
when the ball came at you.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.739
(shrieks)

12:20.741 --> 12:23.041
Ava has quality I like.

12:23.043 --> 12:24.275
You're kidding me?

12:24.277 --> 12:26.377
She's just like
my friend Marisol.

12:26.379 --> 12:29.047
No. There is not another
one like Ava out there.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.915
God would not
do that to us.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.450
You like the game, Raffi?

12:32.452 --> 12:34.119
Yeah, I met my cousin there.

12:34.121 --> 12:36.221
-Oh, where is he from?
-Also Cuba.

12:36.223 --> 12:37.255
Where is he now?

12:37.257 --> 12:39.090
-Left field.
-Huh?

12:39.092 --> 12:41.126
Your cousin is Yoenis Céspedes?

12:41.128 --> 12:42.727
Your cousin plays
for the Mets?

12:42.729 --> 12:45.130
God bless America!

12:46.933 --> 12:49.067
He signed my ball.

12:49.069 --> 12:51.369
He also gave me
his number...

12:51.371 --> 12:53.972
52.

12:53.974 --> 12:56.875
So, the Statue of Liberty
is from France,

12:56.877 --> 12:58.243
we have a Ukrainian bakery,

12:58.245 --> 13:00.111
and the New York Mets
are from all over the world.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.514
Nice country you got here.

13:11.424 --> 13:13.892
All right, guys, we got
the whole joint scoped out.

13:13.894 --> 13:16.060
Every country in the world,
all over the school.
Where do we go?

13:16.062 --> 13:17.996
To the one with the most
free stuff! Let's go, go, g--

13:17.998 --> 13:19.664
No, we're all
staying together, Maya.

13:19.666 --> 13:21.099
Okay.

13:21.101 --> 13:22.967
Oh, Cambodia.

13:22.969 --> 13:24.969
Anybody interested in learning
about a new culture?

13:24.971 --> 13:26.538
Yeah, that's been
on my mind lately.

13:30.811 --> 13:34.646
Hi. My name is Riley
and these are my friends.

13:36.016 --> 13:37.649
What was Cambodia
like for you?

13:37.651 --> 13:39.984
Cambodia is
a beautiful country.

13:39.986 --> 13:42.353
I lived there
in a very bad time.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.589
Oh, um...
Well, have a nice day.

13:44.591 --> 13:45.623
What's your story?

13:45.625 --> 13:46.991
Maya, you can't just ask.

13:46.993 --> 13:48.593
We're supposed
to hear stories.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.161
Yes, it's okay.

13:50.163 --> 13:54.098
I have a story. I haven't spoken
of this for a long time.

13:54.100 --> 13:55.333
We don't mean to intrude.

13:55.335 --> 13:58.136
Not intruding
if you really want to hear.

13:58.138 --> 14:00.171
-We do.
-Please.

14:03.443 --> 14:05.476
It's a very hard thing

14:05.478 --> 14:08.112
to decide you must
leave your own country.

14:08.114 --> 14:10.215
Can you guys
even imagine that?

14:10.217 --> 14:12.050
I can imagine it, Riley.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.218
Farkle?

14:14.154 --> 14:15.787
Why did you need
to leave your country?

14:15.789 --> 14:19.357
When I was little, my country
was run by an evil man.

14:19.359 --> 14:23.595
Very cruel.
Millions imprisoned, tortured.

14:26.366 --> 14:30.201
My family, many relatives,

14:30.203 --> 14:34.038
planned for months.
Wait for right moment.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.741
One night, we leave.

14:36.743 --> 14:38.843
I was not even supposed to go.

14:38.845 --> 14:42.013
They thought I would cry.
Bring soldiers.

14:42.015 --> 14:44.382
I only cried inside.

14:44.384 --> 14:48.953
Went to Philippine Islands.
Now here.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.427
Not all of us make it out.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.062
I'm sorry.

14:58.064 --> 15:00.965
You live in a good country,
you know that?

15:03.236 --> 15:05.103
-Hi, guys.
-Hey, Nigel.

15:05.105 --> 15:06.738
Grandma talking
your ears off?

15:06.740 --> 15:08.539
Oh, this is your grandma.

15:08.541 --> 15:12.243
(speaks Cambodian)

15:12.245 --> 15:16.114
I didn't even know
you could talk
and you talk two languages.

15:16.116 --> 15:19.183
I speak English,
Cambodian, and Filipino.

15:19.185 --> 15:22.086
Why would you want
to do that?

15:22.088 --> 15:24.422
So I can understand
what everybody has to say.

15:24.424 --> 15:27.091
You have very nice friends.

15:27.093 --> 15:30.528
Thank you for taking the time
to listen to an old woman.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.096
I'm glad you made it here.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.932
So am I.

15:34.968 --> 15:36.634
Thank you
for sharing your story.

15:49.149 --> 15:52.283
I am in love with Ireland.

15:52.285 --> 15:55.320
Not about potatoes
and soap anymore, huh?

15:55.322 --> 15:57.922
Nope. It's about how proud
I am to be from there.

15:57.924 --> 15:59.557
From the music
to the poets.

15:59.559 --> 16:01.125
I just never wanted
to leave that booth.

16:01.127 --> 16:03.728
Well, you and me
will go to Ireland
the next St. Paddy's Day.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.630
We'll hang out
with the Clutterbuckets.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.231
Yeah. The booth was real
easy to find,

16:07.233 --> 16:08.499
but where exactly is Ireland?

16:08.501 --> 16:10.301
I think it's up
and over there.

16:11.805 --> 16:13.471
Okay, why are you being
so quiet, Farkle?

16:13.473 --> 16:14.572
It's making me
really upset.

16:14.574 --> 16:16.240
-Really?
-No.

16:16.242 --> 16:17.508
Like it. Peaceful.

16:17.510 --> 16:20.345
Yeah, talk, Farkle.
This isn't like you.

16:20.347 --> 16:22.180
I'm not really sure
anymore what's like me.

16:22.182 --> 16:23.348
What's the matter with you?

16:24.484 --> 16:26.084
No, I get it.

16:26.086 --> 16:28.186
It's just hard when you look
at all of these booths

16:28.188 --> 16:30.521
to not picture yourself living
a different type of life, right?

16:30.523 --> 16:32.357
That's what
you're talking about.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.593
Okay.

16:35.595 --> 16:40.198
Well, while all of you guys
were at your booths
of your countries,

16:40.200 --> 16:42.433
I went looking
for the America booth.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.936
Guess what?
They don't have one.

16:44.938 --> 16:46.771
(bell rings)

16:46.772 --> 16:48.605
Man (over PA):
<i>That's the end of today's</i>
<i>Cultural Day celebration.</i>

16:48.608 --> 16:50.842
<i>We hope you learned something</i>
<i>about somewhere else.</i>

16:50.844 --> 16:52.710
Arrivederci, sayonara,

16:52.712 --> 16:54.112
<i>and for all you</i>
<i>native New Yorkers--</i>

16:54.114 --> 16:55.346
<i>get outta here!</i>

16:56.983 --> 16:58.216
Last chance, Farkle.

16:58.218 --> 16:59.717
You want to go
find the Denmark booth?

16:59.719 --> 17:02.320
Yeah, let's give Farkle
a chance to hear some
stories about his people.

17:02.322 --> 17:04.255
No, that's okay. I think
I know too many stories already.

17:13.666 --> 17:16.200
I never knew much about
the Clutterbucket side
of my family.

17:16.202 --> 17:20.271
My mom's Katy Clutterbucket
because that's how she rolls.

17:21.408 --> 17:23.374
We're from Galway, Ireland.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.209
My relatives
were fishermen, mostly.

17:25.211 --> 17:28.212
And I've been looking
up pictures of Ireland,
and it's so beautiful.

17:28.214 --> 17:32.417
So is my mother.
So I'm going to take her
there one day

17:32.419 --> 17:34.485
because we're part of it.

17:34.487 --> 17:37.288
Because the best thing
about being alive is
to feel part of something.

17:39.092 --> 17:41.192
So, thank you
for making me find out.

17:41.194 --> 17:42.927
Great work, Maya.

17:42.929 --> 17:44.495
Thank you for sharing
your story with us.

17:45.698 --> 17:46.764
Riley?

17:48.034 --> 17:50.401
-I'm going with you.
-Duh-hurr.

17:52.705 --> 17:56.374
All through Culture Week
I've been searching the school
for the America booth.

17:56.376 --> 17:58.342
And they don't have one.

17:58.344 --> 18:01.446
And then I found something
that made me understand why.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.319
Field trip.

18:23.269 --> 18:26.204
You don't need an America booth
when you come from here.

18:26.206 --> 18:30.241
This country is one
big cultural fair.

18:30.243 --> 18:32.743
Every day, I walk through
different neighborhoods,

18:32.745 --> 18:36.314
different communities,
and becoming a part of them

18:36.316 --> 18:38.783
is as easy as
stopping by to say hello.

18:43.823 --> 18:46.424
I am this girl right here.

18:46.426 --> 18:48.126
We all are.

18:48.128 --> 18:51.796
A combination of everybody
we see every day.

18:53.266 --> 18:57.001
Once upon a time, Riley Matthews
lived in New York City,

18:57.003 --> 19:01.439
and because of that,
she lives everywhere.

19:01.441 --> 19:03.474
That's my story.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.776
I have a story.

19:05.778 --> 19:07.945
Thank you, Riley.

19:07.947 --> 19:11.482
I'm sure the Great Lady
of New York is smiling
even bigger today.

19:12.519 --> 19:16.420
I know she holds
a torch for all of us.

19:16.422 --> 19:18.022
Go on. Get out of here.

19:21.361 --> 19:24.162
You know, Farkle, you're
the only one who hasn't told
us anything today.

19:24.164 --> 19:27.131
Yeah. We know everyone's
story but yours.

19:27.133 --> 19:28.666
And that doesn't
work in this group.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.334
Farkle?

19:30.336 --> 19:31.869
My great-grandfather
left Denmark

19:31.871 --> 19:33.938
and came to America
right after World War II.

19:33.940 --> 19:35.173
Just him?

19:35.175 --> 19:37.542
I think he was
the only one left.

19:37.544 --> 19:40.444
Well, what about
the others before him?

19:40.446 --> 19:42.980
I don't think they
were named Minkus.

19:42.982 --> 19:44.649
Well, who were they?

19:44.651 --> 19:47.485
I don't know. I don't know
if I'll ever know. There
aren't birth records.

19:47.487 --> 19:49.387
All I know is that
during World War II,

19:49.389 --> 19:52.290
he was adopted by
a Christian family
named Minkus in Denmark

19:52.292 --> 19:53.391
who wanted to help him.

19:53.393 --> 19:54.859
Help him what?

19:55.862 --> 19:57.428
Help him live.

20:02.468 --> 20:04.402
His great-grandfather
was Jewish.

20:06.039 --> 20:08.573
Sometimes it's real hard
when you find out your story.

20:10.810 --> 20:12.143
My whole family--

20:13.546 --> 20:14.779
Yeah.

20:17.183 --> 20:18.916
I'm here if you
ever want to talk.

20:20.153 --> 20:21.219
Me, too.

20:23.489 --> 20:26.991
I found out about these
wonderful people called
"Christian Rescuers."

20:26.993 --> 20:29.727
They saved babies by
taking them in when they were--

20:29.729 --> 20:31.295
Thanks.

20:33.533 --> 20:35.132
I'm glad you found
your story, Riley.

20:36.836 --> 20:38.169
I'm happy you all did.

20:41.007 --> 20:42.940
My story will be about
how lucky we are

20:42.942 --> 20:44.709
to live in a place that
allows you to come here

20:44.711 --> 20:47.912
so you can be
whoever you are.

20:47.914 --> 20:50.581
But that's all I can really
tell you about my heritage
right now.

20:52.885 --> 20:55.920
Because I'm still
finding out who I am.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.622
(bell rings)

21:11.104 --> 21:13.104
We must have walked
all over New York.

21:13.106 --> 21:15.606
My doggies are barking.

21:19.579 --> 21:21.612
Rub my feets.

21:23.283 --> 21:24.548
Yes, darling.

21:24.550 --> 21:27.318
First let me get my
feet rubbing equipment.

21:34.394 --> 21:37.061
Marisol makes me
do the same thing!

21:37.063 --> 21:38.496
Oh, no, trust me,

21:38.498 --> 21:40.598
-there is nobody else
