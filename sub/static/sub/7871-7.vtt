(children cry out in pain)

00:09.177 --> 00:10.477
(children groaning)

00:10.511 --> 00:12.212
Bart, stop it!

00:12.246 --> 00:13.880
You might fall.

00:13.915 --> 00:17.117
Oh, he's such
a cute little rascal.

00:17.151 --> 00:20.153
(thinking) <i>Oh, my God, is</i>
<i>she flirting with me?</i>

00:20.188 --> 00:22.639
I can see where
he gets his good looks.

00:22.673 --> 00:24.374
<i>She</i> is <i>flirting</i>
<i>with me!</i>

00:24.408 --> 00:26.226
<i>Okay, Homer, let</i>
<i>her down easy.</i>

00:26.260 --> 00:27.911
<i>Don't go breaking</i>
<i>any hearts.</i>

00:27.945 --> 00:30.147
What a lucky little boy
to get a trip

00:30.181 --> 00:31.798
to the park
with his grandpa.

00:31.833 --> 00:33.316
<i>Grandpa?!</i>

00:33.351 --> 00:35.018
Grandpa?!

00:35.052 --> 00:36.653
(panting loudly)
Oh, my God!

00:36.687 --> 00:38.021
Should I call
an ambulance?

00:38.055 --> 00:40.440
Help! An old man is dying!

00:40.474 --> 00:42.492
Oh! This boy's grandfather

00:42.527 --> 00:45.545
is a shriveled-up corncob
begging for death!

00:45.580 --> 00:47.314
I am his <i>father!</i>

00:47.348 --> 00:51.535
I can't believe I allowed
you to hit on me!

00:51.569 --> 00:53.320
(quacking)

00:53.354 --> 00:54.821
Beat it, ducks!

00:54.856 --> 00:56.473
I'm not old enough
to have food for you!

00:56.507 --> 00:58.491
I'm sexy! Young and sexy!

00:58.526 --> 00:59.743
(ducks quacking)

00:59.777 --> 01:01.060
(bird caws)

01:01.078 --> 01:03.196
Old man.
I'm not an old man.

01:03.231 --> 01:05.265
This drawing
doesn't think I'm old.

01:05.299 --> 01:06.933
Don't you, drawing?

01:08.202 --> 01:10.503
(gasps) Those aren't
our regular donuts.

01:10.538 --> 01:12.923
They're huge!
With crazy toppings!

01:12.957 --> 01:14.191
HOMER:
Gummy worms!

01:14.225 --> 01:15.525
Churro chunks!

01:15.560 --> 01:17.844
Russian nesting
donut!

01:19.146 --> 01:22.432
I got to eat the rest!

01:22.466 --> 01:23.667
(yelps)
They're gone!

01:23.701 --> 01:26.336
Where did these
Devil Donuts come from?

01:26.370 --> 01:27.921
I don't know.
The guy who gives

01:27.939 --> 01:29.839
the sexual harassment
seminars brought them in.

01:29.874 --> 01:32.776
Actually, Carl, there's <i>no</i>
workplace-appropriate use

01:32.810 --> 01:34.711
for the word "bazooms."

01:34.745 --> 01:36.279
What about
"thunderbags"?

01:36.314 --> 01:38.765
Get lost, pervs!

01:40.100 --> 01:42.235
Okay, where did you
get these donuts?!

01:42.269 --> 01:44.771
From a guy with a cart.
It could be anywhere!

01:46.240 --> 01:48.458
CHIEF WIGGUM:
911. What is your emergency?

01:48.492 --> 01:52.112
I'm calling to report
a missing donut cart.

01:52.146 --> 01:54.113
(siren wailing)

01:54.131 --> 01:56.216
I'm not seeing anything.
Can you get any lower?

01:56.250 --> 01:57.951
But, Chief,
the power lines!

01:57.969 --> 01:59.586
(whiny): "But, Chief,
the power lines."

01:59.620 --> 02:01.488
Go lower!

02:01.522 --> 02:03.740
HOMER:
Nope. Nope. Nothing.

02:03.774 --> 02:04.925
Nope.

02:04.959 --> 02:06.476
I see...

02:06.510 --> 02:07.627
devil horns...

02:07.645 --> 02:09.562
pitchfork... pointed tail,

02:09.597 --> 02:11.464
hooves are... cloven!

02:11.482 --> 02:12.966
We have logo, people!

02:12.984 --> 02:14.017
We have logo!

02:15.920 --> 02:18.104
Sorry, gents,
we're fresh out.

02:18.139 --> 02:20.607
I only make one batch a day.
When they're gone, I'm done.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.409
Oh, no more donuts?!

02:22.443 --> 02:24.010
Make more
or I shoot!

02:24.045 --> 02:26.513
(panting):
I'm not bluffing. Come on.

02:26.547 --> 02:27.681
Hmm.

02:27.715 --> 02:29.649
What have I become?

02:29.684 --> 02:31.117
It's not a good feeling

02:31.152 --> 02:33.019
when you're saying,
"what have I become?"

02:33.054 --> 02:34.955
more than once a day.

02:34.989 --> 02:36.222
Mm. Mm-hmm.

02:37.959 --> 02:39.926
Tell you what,
I could give you

02:39.961 --> 02:41.795
a sneak preview
of a new donut

02:41.829 --> 02:43.980
that's still
in the R&D phase.

02:44.015 --> 02:47.150
Oh. Beer keg donut?!

02:47.184 --> 02:48.385
(slurps)

02:49.687 --> 02:51.087
I would be honored

02:51.122 --> 02:53.256
to shake the hand
that glazed this.

02:53.291 --> 02:54.658
I'm Terence.

02:54.692 --> 02:56.826
(softly):
Tell me everything about you.

02:56.861 --> 02:58.361
You're from
Portland?

02:58.396 --> 03:00.363
I've heard of people
being from there.

03:00.398 --> 03:01.781
<i>No, I haven't.</i>

03:01.816 --> 03:03.683
Yeah, but Portland
just got too played out.

03:03.718 --> 03:05.118
The city used
to be <i>real.</i>

03:05.152 --> 03:07.053
Do you know there are
now restaurants there

03:07.088 --> 03:09.189
with <i>two</i> locations?
(chuckles)

03:09.223 --> 03:10.974
Not near <i>my</i> kids.

03:11.008 --> 03:12.709
Wait a minute.
You have <i>kids?</i>

03:12.743 --> 03:15.395
You can't have kids.
<i>Look</i> at you.

03:15.429 --> 03:17.364
You have a fun job,
a skull ring--

03:17.398 --> 03:19.032
and it's not
Halloween--

03:19.066 --> 03:21.067
<i>and</i> your belt
is a seat belt!

03:21.102 --> 03:23.653
No one would ever think
<i>you're</i> a lame old man.

03:23.688 --> 03:26.272
Ah, you can't let being
a dad slow you down.

03:26.307 --> 03:28.992
Me and the fam are doing
the whole "urban nomad" thing.

03:29.026 --> 03:31.061
You know, just looking
for an undiscovered city

03:31.095 --> 03:32.579
with affordable houses.

03:32.613 --> 03:34.230
(gasps) Our houses are
the cheapest!

03:34.265 --> 03:36.616
The one next to me's
been on sale forever!

03:36.650 --> 03:39.085
I see them lowering
the price every morning

03:39.120 --> 03:41.454
when I go out to pee.

03:41.489 --> 03:43.757
Please. Please rush into this.

03:43.791 --> 03:45.191
Please rush into this.

03:45.226 --> 03:46.593
What a find!

03:46.627 --> 03:48.428
Underneath all
the ugly renovations

03:48.462 --> 03:50.430
this house has
Neutra bones.

03:50.464 --> 03:52.465
In my house,
we found human bones.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.067
Emily and I have
always dreamed

03:54.101 --> 03:55.702
of restoring
an architectural masterpiece.

03:55.736 --> 03:59.472
I have a graduate degree
in Mid-Century Kitsch.

03:59.507 --> 04:01.241
Thanks for turning us on
to this place, Homer.

04:01.275 --> 04:02.542
You're a pretty cool guy.

04:02.576 --> 04:05.545
Really? I'm... (gasps) cool?!

04:05.579 --> 04:08.481
Oh, can I man-hug you?

04:08.516 --> 04:09.983
Sure.

04:10.017 --> 04:12.619
(grunts)
I don't know how!

04:15.289 --> 04:16.773
Okay, our
first hangout

04:16.807 --> 04:18.324
with the cool
new neighbors.

04:18.358 --> 04:20.125
I've already blown
them away--

04:20.161 --> 04:21.827
their words,
I assume--

04:21.862 --> 04:23.613
so don't
screw it up!

04:23.647 --> 04:26.466
Oh, relax, kids.
Just be yourselves.

04:26.500 --> 04:30.003
Oh, great, Marge,
now that's in their heads!

04:30.037 --> 04:33.006
Hey, this is my
armadillo, Chewy.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.809
Uh, Mexico Chewy,
not <i>Star Wars</i> Chewie.

04:35.843 --> 04:38.611
<i>Star Wars</i> Chewie is
just a man in a costume,

04:38.646 --> 04:41.581
so he's not scary.

04:41.615 --> 04:44.684
And this is our baby, Corduroy,
(squeals)

04:44.718 --> 04:46.519
and our son, T-Rex.

04:46.554 --> 04:48.822
Yeah, neighbors.
Heh, I get it.

04:48.856 --> 04:51.124
T-Rex?
Even their names are cool.

04:51.158 --> 04:52.692
Uh, this is,
um...

04:52.726 --> 04:57.163
Ice Cream, Bungee Jump,
and... Viral Video.

04:57.198 --> 04:58.098
(growls)

04:59.683 --> 05:01.084
Wow!
Whoa!

05:01.118 --> 05:02.669
BART:
Cool.

05:02.703 --> 05:04.804
Look at these
obscure card games!

05:04.839 --> 05:07.107
Hey, do you have Uno?

05:07.141 --> 05:09.426
I <i>did,</i> when I was <i>uno.</i>

05:09.460 --> 05:11.478
Check out all these
Sergeant Activity dolls!

05:11.512 --> 05:13.646
No, that's
Combat Jack,

05:13.681 --> 05:15.715
the original
British doll

05:15.749 --> 05:18.318
that Sergeant
Activity ripped off.

05:18.352 --> 05:20.887
Fine. You have a weird
old version of something.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.338
Let's just watch TV.

05:22.373 --> 05:26.443
Uh, TV?
We don't own a TV.

05:26.477 --> 05:28.645
I didn't know
that was an option.

05:28.679 --> 05:30.113
I think
I'm done here.

05:30.147 --> 05:31.948
Lisa, go nuts.

05:31.982 --> 05:35.652
My dad only lets me watch
what's on his queue.

05:35.686 --> 05:38.054
If I don't get
off the Cloud Palace,

05:38.105 --> 05:40.190
I'll never get home
for school tomorrow,

05:40.224 --> 05:42.859
but the Toad Spirit
has Aunt Ginzee!

05:42.893 --> 05:44.093
(gasps)

05:44.128 --> 05:46.129
(humming nervously)

05:49.533 --> 05:52.168
"Scientists prove
cat heaven real,

05:52.203 --> 05:53.803
human heaven not!"

05:53.838 --> 05:56.172
(gasps)
That's so sad!

05:56.207 --> 05:58.041
Those are joke
headlines.

05:58.075 --> 05:59.843
It's not a real
newspaper,

05:59.877 --> 06:01.911
it's just satire.

06:01.946 --> 06:04.681
Oh... satire!

06:06.283 --> 06:09.419
And these fake movie
reviews are so mean,

06:09.453 --> 06:12.055
it's hilarious!
(laughs)

06:12.089 --> 06:14.190
Oh, those <i>are</i> real.

06:14.225 --> 06:16.359
Great paper.

06:17.428 --> 06:18.828
Maggie's a little hungry.

06:18.863 --> 06:20.830
Oh, you can go
ahead and feed her.

06:20.865 --> 06:23.600
Corduroy could
probably use a snack.

06:23.634 --> 06:24.868
(suckling)

06:24.902 --> 06:28.571
Hmm, that's not
applesauce.

06:28.606 --> 06:30.707
Oh, uh, you don't have
to be uncomfortable

06:30.741 --> 06:32.542
around another
nursing mom.

06:32.576 --> 06:35.111
Breast-feeding's
just a healthy thing we all do.

06:35.145 --> 06:36.779
It sure is!

06:36.814 --> 06:40.533
There's nothing
more natural than... that.

06:40.568 --> 06:42.402
It's just that
Maggie's already...

06:42.436 --> 06:46.072
milked me today.
(nervous laugh)

06:46.106 --> 06:47.607
Homer, I think we should go.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.075
We're not like these people.

06:49.109 --> 06:50.260
(gasps)

06:50.294 --> 06:51.611
Check out my new look.

06:51.645 --> 06:53.279
Terence shaved my head.

06:53.314 --> 06:54.964
You're all bald!

06:54.999 --> 06:57.967
No, I'm young-person <i>cool</i> bald!

06:58.002 --> 07:00.136
Not old-person sad bald.

07:00.170 --> 07:02.772
I never want
to see these again!

07:03.807 --> 07:05.441
(groans)

07:09.603 --> 07:11.103
Check it out,
Flanders!

07:11.137 --> 07:14.506
Us cool dads
are sharing a mono-yard!

07:14.541 --> 07:16.909
Guess I can't be
your best friend anymore.

07:16.943 --> 07:19.662
(chuckles) To be honest, that comes
as a tremendous relief.

07:19.696 --> 07:21.680
Boo-hoo-hoo!
You could cry all night,

07:21.731 --> 07:23.782
it's not gonna win me back!

07:26.686 --> 07:27.870
(gate creaks)

07:27.904 --> 07:31.140
(gasps)
I can finally compost!

07:31.174 --> 07:33.359
(Lisa humming happily)

07:33.410 --> 07:36.595
Maybe we shouldn't rush things
with the new neighbors.

07:36.630 --> 07:40.032
You know, we might not
all be a perfect match.

07:40.066 --> 07:41.984
I have a plan to
deal with that.

07:42.002 --> 07:43.936
Step one: Change everything
about ourselves

07:43.970 --> 07:45.871
until we are
super-cool. The end.

07:45.905 --> 07:48.674
But I always thought
you <i>were</i> cool.

07:48.708 --> 07:50.309
Honey, I'm not cool.

07:50.343 --> 07:51.510
I was never cool.

07:51.544 --> 07:53.045
I didn't go to college.

07:53.079 --> 07:55.881
Every CD I have, I
bought at a car wash.

07:55.932 --> 07:57.683
Black-and-white films
make me angry.

07:57.717 --> 07:59.468
I can't pronounce "artisanal."

07:59.502 --> 08:02.321
I only know David Cross
from the Chipmunks movie.

08:02.355 --> 08:04.323
Not only do I <i>like</i> Van Halen,

08:04.357 --> 08:06.492
but I think they keep
getting better.

08:06.526 --> 08:07.660
Oh...

08:07.694 --> 08:09.295
But if me and
my kids do

08:09.329 --> 08:11.363
the same stuff as
Terence and his kids,

08:11.398 --> 08:14.249
I could be
a cool dad.

08:14.284 --> 08:17.336
Well, sweetie, if it's
that important to you,

08:17.370 --> 08:19.638
I guess we can try.

08:19.673 --> 08:22.374
Thanks, baby. Here,
have a bracelet

08:22.409 --> 08:24.843
made of a '70s
educational film strip.

08:24.878 --> 08:27.346
Ooh, hygiene!

08:27.380 --> 08:28.614
♪ Yeah, it's a real cool club

08:28.648 --> 08:31.083
♪ And you're not part of it

08:32.118 --> 08:34.086
♪ Yeah, it's a real cool club

08:34.120 --> 08:36.288
♪ And you'll never be
a part of it. ♪

08:37.791 --> 08:41.727
MARGE: <i>Your father took you to a</i>
<i>Korean gangster film festival?</i>

08:41.760 --> 08:43.996
Yeah, it was great!
This one guy was part

08:44.030 --> 08:46.048
of another guy's gang--
I mean, <i>kkangpae--</i>

08:46.082 --> 08:48.367
but then he quit and
joined another <i>kkangpae,</i>

08:48.401 --> 08:50.219

first <i>kkangpae</i> found out,

08:50.253 --> 08:52.271
they were so mad they put
his feet in a blender!

08:52.305 --> 08:54.723

noodles, and blood splashed on him!

08:54.741 --> 08:57.026

we walked into a gallery,

08:57.060 --> 08:58.761

home exhausted and pretentious!

09:06.836 --> 09:09.405
No, we need to take kids
to grown-up stuff.

09:09.439 --> 09:12.241
That's Terence's
parenting style.

09:12.275 --> 09:14.626
Parenting shouldn't
have a style!

09:14.661 --> 09:16.795
Parenting is
about bedtimes,

09:16.830 --> 09:18.947

on computers,

09:18.982 --> 09:20.816

punishments

09:20.850 --> 09:22.284

the scarf?

09:33.313 --> 09:35.381

neck sweat!

09:35.415 --> 09:37.449
Wearing scarves
in non-scarf weather

09:37.484 --> 09:39.451
is the essence of cool.

09:39.486 --> 09:41.120
The essence!

09:42.155 --> 09:43.372
Ooh.

09:45.141 --> 09:47.760
Aw, man, my goatee

only grow in twos?

09:50.663 --> 09:53.599
Oh, I hope T-Rex likes
the present I made him.

09:53.633 --> 09:56.468
Made? Why didn't you
just buy him a toy?

09:56.503 --> 09:59.838

are how cool families

09:59.873 --> 10:02.141

give our kids...
