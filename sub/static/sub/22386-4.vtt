Hey, Wally!

(Wally barking)

01:03.998 --> 01:05.964
That's a treatable trick.

01:06.600 --> 01:10.135
Hmm, that's strange.
This bait bucket is bare.

01:11.539 --> 01:14.206
Now, don't be

01:14.208 --> 01:17.743
Just got a fresh shipment
of flash-frozen fish.

01:17.745 --> 01:18.377
Hmm.

01:18.379 --> 01:21.647
Sorry, Wally.
This crate's clear out of cod.

01:21.649 --> 01:24.383
Nothing but ice cubes.

01:28.556 --> 01:31.256

01:32.026 --> 01:34.159
Where did my lunch bag go?

01:34.929 --> 01:37.262

to the tuna treat?

Superspy Chase is on the case.

When you least expect him...

02:08.095 --> 02:08.627
Ah!

02:08.629 --> 02:11.163
...expect him.
Sorry, Marshall.

02:11.165 --> 02:12.431
I kind of slipped.

02:12.433 --> 02:15.968
That's okay.

is happening

03:20.534 --> 03:23.902
A crate full of frozen fish
vanished from the Flounder.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.003
The bait bucket was empty

03:25.005 --> 03:28.340
and even Cap'n Turbot's
tuna sandwich disappeared.

<i> Help, help, help, help!</i>

03:30.477 --> 03:31.710

(Laughing)

03:35.282 --> 03:35.948
RYDER:
Exactly.

03:35.950 --> 03:39.484
We have to find out
who it is and stop them.

03:40.454 --> 03:44.656
Chase, I need your detective
skills and your superspy gear

03:44.658 --> 03:46.992
to help solve the mystery.

03:46.994 --> 03:48.527
Yes, yes, yes!

03:50.064 --> 03:51.897
Chase, the superspy.

03:51.899 --> 03:55.400

We may have to check
in the water, too.

03:55.402 --> 03:59.938

and scuba gear.

these treats to catch the thief.

06:06.533 --> 06:07.032
Huh?

06:07.034 --> 06:10.569
Wait, there were
five pup treats here

06:10.571 --> 06:12.304

06:12.306 --> 06:15.173
Somebody took one
right from under our noses.

06:15.175 --> 06:18.009
Chase, can you
pick up the scent?

06:18.011 --> 06:20.312
I'll super-sniff them out.

06:20.314 --> 06:23.115
What's the smell, dude?

06:23.117 --> 06:26.885
Fish, fish and-- ugh,
more fish.

Hooray!

You found Driftwood Ducky!

There's more than one?

08:34.515 --> 08:36.848
Ruff, ruff!!

08:37.117 --> 08:42.354
Ryder, our slippery suspects
are penguins!

08:42.356 --> 08:43.388
Penguins?

08:43.390 --> 08:44.122
CHASE:
Yes.

08:44.124 --> 08:46.658
I almost had them
but they got away.

08:46.660 --> 08:49.728
I need pictures
of these precious penguins.

all the way up here?

Darn, missed again.

09:22.362 --> 09:25.764
Now where could those
precocious penguins be?

09:25.766 --> 09:28.733
It's a proverbial
penguin posse!

09:28.735 --> 09:31.303
CHASE:
Gotcha.

09:31.305 --> 09:32.437
Sorry, Cap'n.

09:32.439 --> 09:36.541
We have to get those birds
back to their cold homes.

09:36.543 --> 09:37.208

CAP'N TURBOT:
Aie-aie-aie! An iceberg!

09:46.353 --> 09:49.254
The penguins must have ridden
the iceberg up here.

09:49.256 --> 09:53.325
Maybe they could ride it home
if we can get them on it.

09:53.327 --> 09:54.759
We can't lure them.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.261
We're all out of fish.

09:56.263 --> 09:57.996
What else do penguins eat?

09:57.998 --> 10:01.099
The usual-- fish, fish, krill,

10:01.101 --> 10:04.736
fish, more fish, squid.

10:04.738 --> 10:07.639
Oh, that's it-- my squid jerky!

10:07.641 --> 10:12.077
I was saving this squid jerky
for Wally's stocking stuffer.

10:12.079 --> 10:13.645
(Sniffing)

10:13.647 --> 10:14.579
Gross.

10:14.581 --> 10:15.814
Those pesky pilfering penguins

10:15.816 --> 10:18.383
won't be able to resist
my scrumptious squid.

10:18.385 --> 10:20.452
Ahh!

10:20.454 --> 10:22.020
That stuff stinks!

10:22.022 --> 10:23.388
Yes, it does.

10:23.390 --> 10:27.659
Maybe just a little nibble.

10:27.661 --> 10:28.593
Oh!

10:28.595 --> 10:31.997
Hey, Zuma, can you take this
over to the iceberg?

Sure thing.

11:04.431 --> 11:05.263
It won't stay icy.

11:05.265 --> 11:08.867
They need to get back
to colder water ASAP.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.435
Hmm.
I've got it!

11:10.437 --> 11:12.837
Cap'n, let's check
your lighthouse log

11:12.839 --> 11:14.439
for any ships headed south.

11:14.441 --> 11:15.840
Great idea, Ryder.

A frozen-fish-carrying frigate

11:18.812 --> 11:21.479
is headed to the farthest tip
of South America.

11:21.481 --> 11:24.082
Time to move an iceberg.

11:24.084 --> 11:26.584
(Ship's horn blasting)

11:29.690 --> 11:31.489
They're so cute!

11:31.491 --> 11:33.525
I want to slide like a penguin.

11:33.527 --> 11:36.327
Just hop up and ride
on your belly.

11:36.329 --> 11:37.529
Whee!

11:37.531 --> 11:39.564
Me too, me too, me too!

11:39.566 --> 11:40.265
Whoa!

11:40.267 --> 11:42.000
¶ You're all good pups ¶

11:42.002 --> 11:44.335
¶ And we saved the day ¶

11:44.337 --> 11:46.304

11:54.414 --> 11:58.249
RUBBLE:
Who's the best sand sculptor
in adventure bay?

11:58.251 --> 12:00.585
Me, that's who.

12:00.587 --> 12:02.120
I got it!

12:02.122 --> 12:04.089
No, I got it!

12:04.091 --> 12:11.262
¶

12:11.264 --> 12:12.263
(Giggling)

12:12.265 --> 12:14.032
More like it got you.

12:14.034 --> 12:14.966
(Laughing)

12:14.968 --> 12:18.536
That darling dolphin family
should be near, Wally.

12:18.538 --> 12:19.537
I can't wait to see

12:19.539 --> 12:22.107
how their perfectly precious
newborn pup is doing.

12:22.109 --> 12:25.310
(Dolphin clicking)

12:25.312 --> 12:26.311
(Barking)

12:26.313 --> 12:28.780
I don't see the dolphin pup
either, Wally.

12:28.782 --> 12:30.181
Leaping lionfish!

12:30.183 --> 12:33.585
There's that dynamic little
dolphin, playing on the beach!

12:33.587 --> 12:36.387
Wait, that dolphin pup can fly!

12:36.389 --> 12:40.959
(Laughing)
Oh! It's just a blowup toy.

12:40.961 --> 12:43.728
(Barking)

12:43.730 --> 12:44.562
Ah!

12:44.564 --> 12:47.198
Wally, don't fidget
a flipper.

12:47.200 --> 12:51.236
He's right next to you.

12:52.739 --> 12:53.972
(Dolphin clicking)

12:53.974 --> 12:58.777
That's a perfectly pleasant and
particularly perky little pup.

12:58.779 --> 13:01.479
(Ducks quacking)

13:06.753 --> 13:09.187
Uh-oh, the dolphin pup's
heading upriver.

13:09.189 --> 13:10.088
That's no good.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.289
That river's too shallow
for dolphins.

13:11.291 --> 13:15.093
We need to get the pup out
before it gets stuck.

13:15.095 --> 13:17.328
(Ringing)

13:18.632 --> 13:19.964
Hi, Cap'n Turbot.
<i>Hi, dolphin.</i>

13:19.966 --> 13:21.232
<i> The baby Ryder swam upriver.</i>

13:21.234 --> 13:24.569
<i> I mean, hi, Ryder.</i>
<i> The baby dolphin swam upriver!</i>

13:24.571 --> 13:26.137
A new baby dolphin?

13:26.139 --> 13:29.207
<i> Yes. It could get trapped</i>
<i> in the rocks or shallow water.</i>

13:29.209 --> 13:30.809
Don't worry, Cap'n.

13:30.811 --> 13:33.845
No job is too big,
no pup is too small.

13:33.847 --> 13:36.281
Not even a dolphin pup.

13:37.284 --> 13:40.051
PAW Patrol to the lookout!

13:40.053 --> 13:41.586
Ryder needs us!

13:41.588 --> 13:43.822

getting here so fast.

14:42.048 --> 14:44.749
Cap'n Turbot called.
There's a pup in trouble.

14:44.751 --> 14:48.019
My tummy did
kind of hurt earlier

14:48.021 --> 14:51.389
but I think I was just hungry.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.357
(Laughing)

14:52.359 --> 14:54.392
It's a dolphin pup
that needs our help.

14:54.394 --> 14:57.095
It took a wrong turn and
it's swimming up the river.

14:57.097 --> 14:59.063
There's lots of
shallow spots and rocks

14:59.065 --> 15:02.901
where a little dolphin
could get trapped.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.336
Zuma, I need you
and your hovercraft

15:05.338 --> 15:08.373
to help get the dolphin pup
back to the ocean.

15:08.375 --> 15:09.507
Let's dive in!

15:09.509 --> 15:12.644
Chase, I need you to set
your net across the river

15:12.646 --> 15:16.414
so the dolphin can't swim
any farther upstream.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.416
Chase is on the case!

15:18.418 --> 15:22.053

the dolphin anywhere.

Hmm, me neither.

(Dolphin clicking)

17:09.229 --> 17:09.927
Found him.

Come on, baby dolphin.

17:11.998 --> 17:14.365
Back out to the bay
where you belong.

How did you get back--

17:21.775 --> 17:23.574
there.

How are we gonna get the pup
back out into the ocean?

17:27.981 --> 17:30.715
I don't know. The little dude
just wants to play.

17:30.717 --> 17:33.718
(Snapping fingers)
A playmate,
like the toy dolphin

17:33.720 --> 17:35.420
you pups were playing with
at the beach.

17:35.422 --> 17:38.756
Maybe the baby dolphin will
follow that out into the bay.

17:42.996 --> 17:46.164
But it's in shallow water
and it's really rocky.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.632
Hurry before he gets stuck.

17:47.634 --> 17:51.035
Don't worry, Chase.

19:03.877 --> 19:05.076
What's that?

19:05.078 --> 19:06.177
It popped.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.245
That's okay, Rocky.

19:07.247 --> 19:08.946
Use your tool arm
to patch the hole

19:08.948 --> 19:10.681
and then blow it up again.

19:10.683 --> 19:12.183
Green means go!

19:12.185 --> 19:14.118
We can save
this dolphin, guys.

19:14.120 --> 19:16.120
Yeah, we can make him bigger,

19:16.122 --> 19:19.223
stronger and puffier
than before.
