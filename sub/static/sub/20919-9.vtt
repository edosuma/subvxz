00:41.316 --> 00:42.532
Aah!

00:44.286 --> 00:46.719
Gross! You belch on me,

00:46.755 --> 00:49.081
and I will turn you inside out!

01:08.452 --> 01:10.902
Press the attack. Do not
give it a chance to recover.

01:10.937 --> 01:12.737
One press, coming up! [Grunts]

01:12.772 --> 01:16.567
Oh! Right in the toes.

01:16.602 --> 01:18.644
Captain Marvel!

01:18.679 --> 01:20.604
I see her, Black Panther.

01:20.639 --> 01:22.839
Keep the monster busy down here.

01:22.874 --> 01:25.375
[screaming]

01:25.452 --> 01:28.120
Ms. Marvel, Vision,
get those civilians to safety.

01:31.041 --> 01:35.068
Go! I will keep the monster
off of you, like so!

01:35.103 --> 01:38.255
[grunts] This'll be close.
[people yell]

01:40.392 --> 01:43.102
[growling]

01:43.178 --> 01:46.346
I'm gonna hit you right
between the... [yelling]

01:49.877 --> 01:52.044
[sighs]
Thanks for the save, Wasp.

01:52.079 --> 01:54.360
Don't thank me yet, Ant-Man.
Better hold on to your lunch!

01:55.916 --> 01:57.236
You're gonna be okay,
little girl.

01:59.286 --> 02:02.879
Oh. My sign language
is a little rusty.

02:02.915 --> 02:04.906
[computer trilling] Hi, Jen.

02:04.942 --> 02:06.641
Nothing to be scared of.

02:06.677 --> 02:08.493
My name is Carol.

02:11.223 --> 02:12.289
[beeps]

02:12.324 --> 02:13.540
Not sure, huh?

02:15.736 --> 02:17.994
Here. This makes you my copilot.

02:18.029 --> 02:20.230
What do you say?

02:20.265 --> 02:21.965
Attagirl.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.458
Okay, everybody,
we're getting you outta here.

02:32.494 --> 02:34.861
[grunts]

02:34.896 --> 02:37.272
You got something in your eye.

02:40.127 --> 02:42.367
Come on, Avengers! I think we
can take that monster down!

02:43.614 --> 02:45.197
[both grunt]

02:48.468 --> 02:50.994
I think the monster
has other ideas.

02:53.765 --> 02:58.435
That thing's a jerk, and one way
or another, it's gonna go down!

02:58.470 --> 03:00.921
[grunting]

03:03.967 --> 03:06.652
Follow me, please. Over here.

03:06.687 --> 03:09.537
Perfect. Thank you.

03:09.573 --> 03:11.097
[grunts]

03:17.639 --> 03:20.031
And he's out!

03:20.066 --> 03:21.233
[singsongy] Hello?

03:21.268 --> 03:23.151
Yep, he's out.

03:25.822 --> 03:28.515
[high-pitched growling]

03:28.550 --> 03:30.609
You can't ever
leave the Avengers,

03:30.644 --> 03:33.077
because you make cleanup
so easy.

03:33.113 --> 03:35.272
So, what exactly is that thing?

03:35.307 --> 03:38.032
And how did it get here?
It was an accident.

03:38.068 --> 03:40.636
Dr. Foster, you were
responsible for this?

03:40.638 --> 03:43.113
I was trying to open a door
to another dimension,

03:43.148 --> 03:45.040
because I was looking
for the missing Avengers.

03:45.075 --> 03:46.424
And I found them.

04:02.709 --> 04:05.568
The Avengers are alive?
Are you sure?

04:05.604 --> 04:08.755
I'm almost certain of it.

04:08.790 --> 04:12.225
I discovered a way to back-trace their
energy signature through space-time.

04:12.260 --> 04:14.152
But sending you to them
will be risky.

04:14.187 --> 04:16.762
Doesn't matter. Send us.

04:16.798 --> 04:19.357
Because risky or not, we're
bringing the Avengers back.

04:19.392 --> 04:22.727
These tethers
are your lifeline back.

04:22.762 --> 04:25.362
Find the missing Avengers, then
activate the tethers to come home.

04:27.918 --> 04:29.354
Each of you will be sent across space
and time [wrist devices beeping]

04:29.378 --> 04:33.146
To one of the missing Avengers.

04:33.223 --> 04:35.181
Find the missing Avengers,
make physical contact,

04:35.216 --> 04:36.783
then use your tether
to bring them home.

04:36.818 --> 04:38.902
[whirring]

04:38.937 --> 04:42.538
Don't activate your tether
until you've found them.

04:42.574 --> 04:44.674
You will only have
one shot at this.

04:44.709 --> 04:47.260
One shot is all
we're gonna need.

04:47.295 --> 04:49.704
We're gonna find our friends
and bring 'em home.

04:49.739 --> 04:51.381
All right, Avengers.
Let's do it.

04:51.416 --> 04:53.283
[whirring]

05:02.703 --> 05:04.419
[whirring stops]

05:11.136 --> 05:14.095
Okay, Vision.
Looks like it's you and me.

05:16.124 --> 05:18.691
Whoa. [Grunts] Vision!

05:18.727 --> 05:21.503
Hmm. Strange.

05:21.538 --> 05:23.763
My systems should be functioning
normally, but I am...

05:23.798 --> 05:26.708
feeling a bit off.

05:26.743 --> 05:29.752
I suggest remaining covert until
we're able to assess the situation.

05:29.788 --> 05:31.148
I'm just gonna go
for a quick look.

05:32.875 --> 05:34.591
Wasp, while it may in fact
appear safe,

05:34.626 --> 05:38.687
I strongly urge a more discreet
tactic in our reconnoiter.

05:38.722 --> 05:40.672
I appreciate the concern.
It's kind of sweet.

05:40.707 --> 05:41.707
But we're fine. But...

05:43.977 --> 05:47.504
Huh. Not a single light
on anywhere.

05:47.539 --> 05:49.255
City's deserted.

05:54.746 --> 05:56.646
Whoa!

05:56.682 --> 06:00.650
That's weird. Now my suit's
functions are slow to respond.

06:00.686 --> 06:04.921
As if something is interfering with
the technology in our systems. Huh?

06:04.956 --> 06:07.957
Kang. Kang. Kang.
[both groaning]

06:07.993 --> 06:10.602
Kang. Kang. Kang. Kang!
Or at least Kang's head.

06:10.637 --> 06:13.789
Kang.

06:13.791 --> 06:17.325
A giant floating head.
That's never a good look.

06:21.564 --> 06:25.617
[grunts]

06:25.652 --> 06:29.120
[electronic tone blearing]
[grunts]

06:29.155 --> 06:31.906
[groans]

06:31.942 --> 06:32.942
[mechanical humming]

06:35.028 --> 06:37.595
Hey, Kang head! Heads up!

06:42.252 --> 06:43.252
[crash] Yeah!

06:44.287 --> 06:45.603
I gotcha!

06:49.467 --> 06:53.544
[shudders] I didn't think these
things could look any creepier.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.797
Wasp, another incoming.
[electronic tone blaring]

06:55.832 --> 06:57.990
[both grunt]

06:58.026 --> 07:00.326
Vision, you gotta get up.
Vision!

07:03.206 --> 07:06.341
Outta my way, chumps! [Grunts]

07:06.376 --> 07:09.310
Who are you calling chumps?

07:09.346 --> 07:12.731
Oh, pardon me.
Chumps and chumpette.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.833
Red Hulk.

07:14.868 --> 07:17.068
Vision and Wasp.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.678
'Bout time some other heroes
showed up.

07:20.581 --> 07:21.581
[grunts]

07:25.086 --> 07:26.686
Yeah, that's gonna leave a mark.

07:26.721 --> 07:28.638
[powering down]

07:28.673 --> 07:30.407
[beeping] Oh, for the love of...

07:30.442 --> 07:34.193
Five. Four. I really hate
it when they self-destruct.

07:34.228 --> 07:37.238
Three. Two. Hope you
two don't cry easy.

07:37.273 --> 07:39.223
One.

07:39.259 --> 07:40.892
[Red Hulk grunts]

07:40.928 --> 07:42.327
[Vision, Wasp yell]

07:45.189 --> 07:47.132
[grunts]

07:47.167 --> 07:49.259
We appear to remain functional.

07:49.294 --> 07:52.128
Where are we? And when are we?

07:52.163 --> 07:57.283
Great. Knew it was only
a matter of time with old Kangy

07:57.318 --> 07:59.544
that some time-traveling
nonsense would go on.

07:59.579 --> 08:00.845
Better follow me.

08:05.084 --> 08:07.219
[groans]

08:07.254 --> 08:08.728
[buzzing]
Wasn't expecting company.

08:08.764 --> 08:10.647
Welcome to the man cave.

08:10.682 --> 08:14.392
Good thing I tidied up the
place last night, huh?

08:14.428 --> 08:18.029
We're underground
where Kang can't find us.

08:18.064 --> 08:20.081
As for your second question,
you're in the future.

08:20.116 --> 08:21.924
Kang showed up a few years ago.

08:21.959 --> 08:24.669
Conquered New York, took out
all the tech in the city,

08:24.704 --> 08:26.212
and ran everyone out.

08:26.247 --> 08:28.281
Everyone but you? Ha!

08:28.316 --> 08:31.292
[grunts]

08:31.328 --> 08:34.003
No one runs me out. [Laughing]

08:36.508 --> 08:39.384
You say Kang took out
all the technology?

08:39.419 --> 08:42.620
Yep. Kang's good
at all that kind of crud.

08:42.655 --> 08:44.755
That would explain
my current weakness.

08:44.791 --> 08:47.150
Whatever affects technology
is affecting me.

08:47.185 --> 08:48.705
It's effecting me, too,
but not as bad.

08:51.356 --> 08:53.114
[crunching]

08:53.149 --> 08:55.858
Hungry? [Chittering]

08:55.894 --> 08:58.069
Do we look hungry to you?

08:58.105 --> 09:01.472
Ha! More for me. [Chomps]

09:01.507 --> 09:04.192
Okay, my turn
to ask the questions.

09:04.227 --> 09:07.612
What are you kids doing time
traveling in my neck of the woods?

09:07.648 --> 09:10.481
Kang was part of a Cabal
that snatched the Avengers.

09:10.517 --> 09:13.443
We think Kang must've taken at
least one of the Avengers here.

09:13.478 --> 09:16.287
Have you seen any Avengers here?
Or other heroes?

09:16.322 --> 09:19.081
Mm, forget it, sparky. Mm.

09:19.117 --> 09:21.350
Hasn't been an Avenger
seen here in years.

09:21.385 --> 09:23.578
Since Kang showed up.

09:23.613 --> 09:26.314
Everyone else is long gone.

09:26.316 --> 09:29.058
You're looking at the only hero
New York has left.

09:29.094 --> 09:31.794
Are you sure?
Not Captain America?

09:31.830 --> 09:33.863
Nope. Not Hulk?

09:33.898 --> 09:35.631
Nuh-uh. Not Falcon?

09:35.666 --> 09:38.476
Falcon? He's no Avenger!

09:38.511 --> 09:40.661
He's worse than Kang! Huh?

09:40.696 --> 09:41.696
[whirring] Oh, no.

09:42.950 --> 09:45.617
[all grunt]

09:48.822 --> 09:50.463
Ow!

09:50.499 --> 09:51.914
It can't be.

09:54.844 --> 09:58.671
Falcon, is that you?

10:06.247 --> 10:07.973
Falcon, what are you doing?

10:08.008 --> 10:10.183
Huh! Nice try.

10:15.506 --> 10:17.315
[grunts, groans]

10:18.835 --> 10:20.485
[Falcon grunting]

10:26.400 --> 10:29.077
Been saving this to use on you,
bird boy!

10:33.141 --> 10:35.041
[grunts]

10:39.739 --> 10:43.307
[yells]

10:43.342 --> 10:46.244
Bah! He's running away.

10:46.279 --> 10:49.388
No. He's looking
for room to fight.

10:49.423 --> 10:51.307
He appears to have found it.
[grunts]

10:53.169 --> 10:56.078
[grunts]

10:56.113 --> 10:59.548
Kang's looking forward to
meeting you again. [Grunting]

10:59.584 --> 11:01.409
Back off, Falcon!

11:01.445 --> 11:03.778
[both grunt]

11:03.814 --> 11:05.738
What is this,
some kind of trick?

11:05.774 --> 11:07.206
How can you be working for Kang?

11:07.241 --> 11:09.341
You sound just like...

11:09.377 --> 11:11.644
But that's impossible! Gotcha!

11:11.679 --> 11:13.371
You lose, traitor. [Groans]

11:15.600 --> 11:18.351
[groaning]
I don't have time for this.

11:18.386 --> 11:20.853
[all yell]

11:20.888 --> 11:24.807
[groaning]

11:24.842 --> 11:26.801
You're coming with me.

11:28.096 --> 11:30.138
[both groan]

11:30.173 --> 11:32.164
He got Vision.

11:32.199 --> 11:34.317
That's not the Falcon we knew.

11:34.352 --> 11:36.185
He's changed. Yep.

11:41.534 --> 11:42.650
[groaning]

11:42.685 --> 11:45.236
Huh?

11:45.271 --> 11:46.920
Feeling better?

11:46.956 --> 11:50.057
As a matter of fact, I am.

11:50.093 --> 11:53.236
Tech dampeners are out in the
city, but not here in the castle.

11:53.271 --> 11:55.004
I can't believe it's really you.

11:55.039 --> 11:56.372
After all these years.

11:56.407 --> 11:59.417
I suppose you're wondering
why I'm working for Kang.

11:59.453 --> 12:01.344
I admit that is
a concern of mine.

12:01.379 --> 12:03.279
It's hard to explain.

12:03.315 --> 12:07.266
Easier to show you.

12:07.302 --> 12:10.022
It's invisible, but you should be
able to see it through this filter.

12:11.948 --> 12:15.774
A singularity.
That is most disturbing.

12:15.810 --> 12:18.752
All of Kang's time traveling
caused a rip in the universe.

12:18.788 --> 12:21.705
Now, in a couple of hours, that black
hole is gonna destroy the Earth.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.974
This is why you work for Kang?

12:24.010 --> 12:26.268
This is why Kang
brought me to the future.

12:26.304 --> 12:29.480
We made a deal.
I help Kang save the world,

12:29.516 --> 12:32.258
and Kang let the people
of New York leave in peace.

12:32.294 --> 12:35.420
So everyone left,
except for Red Hulk.

12:35.497 --> 12:36.940
He thinks Kang is just out
to conquer the world.

12:36.964 --> 12:39.565
Red Hulk.

12:39.600 --> 12:41.550
That insufferable brute
makes it hard

12:41.586 --> 12:45.263
to not destroy the entire city
just to have a moment's peace.

12:45.298 --> 12:47.599
But a deal is a deal.

12:47.634 --> 12:50.968
Speaking of,
you are infringing upon ours

12:51.004 --> 12:53.120
by bringing in this distraction.

12:53.155 --> 12:55.298
Vision's not a distraction.

12:55.333 --> 12:57.466
His computing power can help us.

12:57.502 --> 12:59.113
And we're running out
of options and time.

12:59.137 --> 13:01.780
Now it makes sense, doesn't it?

13:01.856 --> 13:04.941
Why Kang the Conqueror
would deign to join a Cabal.

13:04.976 --> 13:10.521
With Iron Man gone, I needed
Falcon's skills to save the world.

13:10.556 --> 13:14.150
Records indicate that you are not
exactly known for being noble.

13:14.185 --> 13:17.878
My survival is intrinsically tied
to the survival of the Earth,

13:17.914 --> 13:19.781
as is yours.

13:19.816 --> 13:21.958
You would do well
to remember that.

13:21.993 --> 13:23.459
Clock's ticking.

13:25.955 --> 13:27.963
I cannot imagine
what it must've been like...

13:27.999 --> 13:30.099
Trapped for years in the future.

13:30.134 --> 13:33.019
I am sorry it took us
so long to find you.

13:33.054 --> 13:36.372
It hasn't been all bad.
I learned a lot.

13:36.407 --> 13:37.952
Maybe more than I could have
with the Avengers.

13:37.976 --> 13:41.777
Kang taught me forms of combat
that haven't been invented yet.

13:41.812 --> 13:44.122
I built new weapons. I grew up.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.223
I changed.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.067
I just don't know
if it's for the better.

13:48.102 --> 13:50.235
I trust Kang.

13:50.271 --> 13:52.221
But I know I shouldn't.

13:52.256 --> 13:54.424
Makes me think I can't
trust myself anymore.

13:54.459 --> 13:56.575
You are still Falcon.

13:56.610 --> 13:59.386
My scans indicate that,
other than aging,

13:59.422 --> 14:01.339
you are exactly the same person
you were before.

14:01.374 --> 14:04.183
Yeah, and who is that?

14:04.218 --> 14:05.710
An Avenger.

14:11.367 --> 14:13.108
[Wasp] Security everywhere.

14:13.144 --> 14:15.144
Kang has got the entire city
on lockdown.

14:15.180 --> 14:18.822
Still think I should've scouted
ahead before trying this.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.908
I don't have time
for what you think.

14:20.943 --> 14:22.576
I'm gonna get Kang.

14:22.612 --> 14:24.378
But first I'm gonna get Falcon.

14:24.414 --> 14:25.646
[grunts]

14:29.494 --> 14:31.935
Don't hurt Falcon.
If it's really him,

14:31.971 --> 14:34.247
we're gonna rescue him
and bring him home.

14:34.324 --> 14:37.675
[growls] Whatever. My
mission is to destroy Kang

14:37.711 --> 14:39.677
and anyone else
who gets in my way.

14:39.713 --> 14:43.248
But Falcon...
I appreciate your concern.

14:43.283 --> 14:46.000
It's kind of sweet. But I can't
concentrate with all your yapping!

14:47.654 --> 14:49.837
Rerouting energy
from the generators.

14:49.872 --> 14:52.014
If this works,
this will cage the black hole,

14:52.050 --> 14:55.509
sealing its energy and stopping
it from destroying the Earth.

14:55.545 --> 14:58.412
Quickly. Time runs short.

14:58.448 --> 15:01.649
You promised me, Kang. If I pull
this off and save the world?

15:01.651 --> 15:04.677
You do this, and I will
return to my own time,

15:04.712 --> 15:07.138
to never time travel again.

15:07.173 --> 15:08.981
We are nearly out of time.

15:12.328 --> 15:14.003
You better believe
you're outta time.

15:14.038 --> 15:15.738
[yelling]

15:19.126 --> 15:22.194
[Red Hulk yelling] No! You're
going to ruin everything!

15:22.229 --> 15:24.104
Vision?

15:24.139 --> 15:25.982
You are making a mistake!

15:26.017 --> 15:28.042
Oh, so you're on his side,
too, huh? [Growls]

15:30.755 --> 15:32.905
Uh, what exactly is happening?

15:32.940 --> 15:35.382
The generators!
They're gonna incinerate us all!

15:35.418 --> 15:38.577
Everything's gonna blow!

15:38.613 --> 15:41.956
Vision, I'm cutting the flow and
reducing generator intensity!

15:41.991 --> 15:44.071
Then I will stabilize the
generators from the inside.

15:45.903 --> 15:47.979
[beeping]

15:54.462 --> 15:58.063
He did it. The generator
levels are back to normal.

15:58.099 --> 16:00.516
All the android did
was stall our own demise

16:00.551 --> 16:02.452
if we don't succeed
in caging the black hole.

16:02.487 --> 16:04.078
Now's my chance.

16:05.390 --> 16:06.922
Ow! Hey!

16:06.957 --> 16:08.816
Haven't you done enough already?

16:08.851 --> 16:10.934
Now cool it
and start paying attention

16:10.970 --> 16:12.687
to what people have
to say for a change!

16:12.722 --> 16:14.380
[growling]

16:20.346 --> 16:22.763
I didn't do a good job
listening to you earlier.

16:22.798 --> 16:25.191
Now give me the short version
of what's happening.

16:25.268 --> 16:27.634
Kang, Falcon, and I
are trying to save the Earth.

16:27.670 --> 16:33.465
That is how long we have
until the end of the world.

16:33.501 --> 16:35.137
[Red Hulk] That's it? Are you kidding me?
And there's that.

16:35.161 --> 16:37.478
[electricity arcing]

16:37.513 --> 16:40.039
Criminy.

16:40.116 --> 16:42.533
We're seconds away from
a zero-matter event horizon.

16:42.569 --> 16:44.168
We must contain this now.

16:44.203 --> 16:45.338
We are all well aware of that.

16:45.362 --> 16:48.956
Please try to remain
levelheaded as best possible.

16:53.203 --> 16:55.838
We're out of time!
One last chance! Hit it!

17:05.057 --> 17:06.510
The zero-matter event
has been averted.

17:06.534 --> 17:08.217
[sighs]

17:08.252 --> 17:10.935
Ha! You eggheads did it.

17:10.971 --> 17:14.481
Not that I doubted ya, but
I gotta say... [grunts]

17:14.517 --> 17:18.970
[chuckles] Now and forevermore,

17:19.005 --> 17:22.682
Kang's power is as infinite
as time itself.

17:22.717 --> 17:25.209
Saving the Earth
just so you could conquer it.

17:25.286 --> 17:29.447
This is bigger than the Earth.
This is about time.

17:29.482 --> 17:33.025
I now possess a wormhole
in a box.

17:33.060 --> 17:36.078
Stronger, more reliable method
of time travel,

17:36.113 --> 17:38.271
without the negative
side effects.

17:38.307 --> 17:41.775
The universe is mine to conquer,

17:41.811 --> 17:45.929
wherever and whenever I choose.

17:45.965 --> 17:50.134
Kang, you don't have to do this.

17:50.170 --> 17:53.954
You've been a capable lieutenant
these past few years.

17:53.989 --> 17:57.783
Join me. Together we could
subjugate the entire universe.

17:57.818 --> 17:59.718
I thought I knew you.

17:59.753 --> 18:03.072
Oh, you're unbearably naive.

18:03.107 --> 18:06.492
Now gaze upon greatness
for the last time.

18:07.837 --> 18:10.588
[laughing]

18:10.623 --> 18:12.931
[powering down] Huh?

18:12.967 --> 18:15.751
I may be naive,
but I'm not stupid.

18:15.786 --> 18:19.613
I installed tech dampeners
to keep you from using it.

18:19.648 --> 18:21.999
And as for greatness,
you're about to find out

18:22.034 --> 18:23.717
just how great a teacher
you are.

18:24.987 --> 18:27.179
[grunts]

18:40.486 --> 18:42.987
You insufferable... Aah!

18:46.684 --> 18:48.951
Ya miss me? [Yelling]

18:52.114 --> 18:53.647
[grunts, groans]

18:53.683 --> 18:55.640
Kang never misses.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.368
Oh, please! Brag much? Hm?

18:57.403 --> 18:58.702
[grunts]

18:58.737 --> 19:00.905
[grunts]

19:00.940 --> 19:02.498
It's not bragging
when it's fact.

19:02.533 --> 19:03.591
Wasp!

19:06.170 --> 19:08.179
[grunts, groans]

19:09.848 --> 19:11.948
It's just us, my pupil.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.151
You still have things to learn.

19:14.186 --> 19:17.479
Lesson one... kneel before Kang!

19:24.480 --> 19:26.897
[both grunting]

19:26.933 --> 19:29.808
[growls] I've had all the
lessons from you I need.

19:29.843 --> 19:31.685
I didn't teach you everything.

19:31.721 --> 19:32.954
[grunts]

19:32.989 --> 19:35.289
[both grunting]

19:39.988 --> 19:42.563
I'm not your pupil anymore.
I'm not even a kid anymore!

19:42.598 --> 19:44.965
[yelling]

19:48.112 --> 19:49.920
[grunts]

19:49.955 --> 19:52.131
[grunts]

19:52.166 --> 19:54.141
[groans]

19:54.176 --> 19:56.818
The student got
the better of the master.

19:56.854 --> 19:58.846
How amusing.

19:58.881 --> 20:00.489
You lost, Kang.

20:00.524 --> 20:04.527
Not to your student
or your henchman or a sidekick.

20:04.562 --> 20:05.869
To an Avenger.

20:05.905 --> 20:09.248
Lose? Did I?

20:09.283 --> 20:11.908
The true power
behind the Cabal is coming.

20:11.944 --> 20:14.495
He'll take care of things.

20:14.530 --> 20:16.288
In the end, Kang is...
[cries out] [grunts]

20:20.928 --> 20:24.271
That oughta shut your yapper.
Told ya.

20:24.307 --> 20:27.299
No supervillain takes over
my New York City.

20:31.864 --> 20:34.531
All the people... they're
coming out of hiding.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.659
Now that Kang's locked up,
we're gonna rebuild.

20:37.695 --> 20:39.395
People aren't afraid anymore.

20:44.218 --> 20:45.218
You're welcome.

20:47.530 --> 20:48.687
Huh?

20:48.722 --> 20:50.531
All right. Fine.

20:52.427 --> 20:54.577
Eh, all right. Fine.

20:54.612 --> 20:56.478
Put 'er there.

20:56.513 --> 20:58.780
[grunting] [bones crack]

20:58.816 --> 21:02.994
Knock it off!
You androids and your feelings.

21:03.029 --> 21:05.304
Thanks for coming all this way,

21:05.381 --> 21:08.665
even though I'm not
the Falcon you were looking for.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.993
What's everyone gonna say
when they meet the new me?

21:11.028 --> 21:13.337
Does it matter
how others see you?

21:13.372 --> 21:16.457
It's about how you see yourself.

21:16.492 --> 21:19.143
[Falcon] A new day for everyone.
Let's go home.

21:25.626 --> 21:27.568
[bystanders murmuring,
exclaiming]

21:29.788 --> 21:37.788
[chuckles]
