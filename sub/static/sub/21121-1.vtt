00:01.084 --> 00:02.377
<i>Previously on </i> The Night Shift...

00:02.461 --> 00:04.314
Max, there's something
going on with you, isn't there?

00:04.338 --> 00:05.505
I got a GBM, Stage Four.

00:05.631 --> 00:07.299
I'm not dying alone at the VA.

00:07.424 --> 00:09.843
If I can't be a soldier,
I'm going to fall on my shield.

00:09.927 --> 00:13.096
<i>So far, the fire has destroyed
nine homes with no containment in sight.</i>

00:13.222 --> 00:14.681
We had to lave Mac up on that hill.

00:14.765 --> 00:17.118
Tell Search and Rescue to send
a chopper up there for him now.

00:17.142 --> 00:18.936
This place needs strong medicine now.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.813
If I didn't know any better, Julian,
I'd think you were letting me go.

00:21.939 --> 00:23.106
You think hard on this, Paul.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.525
You walk out of here, I'll cut you off.

00:25.984 --> 00:28.403
I made a decision without
consulting anyone who works here.

00:28.487 --> 00:29.780
<i>Topher took everyone else.</i>

00:29.863 --> 00:31.949
<i>He's the glue, Dad.
He goes, we go.</i>

00:32.031 --> 00:34.034
I can't quit like everybody else.

00:34.117 --> 00:37.621
If I do, then I have to go back home
and I can't do that again.

00:38.163 --> 00:41.166
Shouldn't there be someone
that you let know where you're off to?

00:41.250 --> 00:42.167
I don't mean to be a downer,

00:42.251 --> 00:44.211
but where you're going,
you might not come back.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:14.760 --> 02:17.095
Running out on fuel, guys,
gonna have to turn back.

02:17.179 --> 02:18.221
Just a little longer.

02:18.305 --> 02:19.890
They saw the signals right around here.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.266
We gotta keep looking.

02:23.560 --> 02:24.394
I see the fires!

02:24.478 --> 02:25.771
That's got to be Mac's signal.

02:26.730 --> 02:28.857
There's Mac, there's Mac, put us down!

02:28.940 --> 02:29.816
Too many trees.

02:29.900 --> 02:31.943
Nearest landing zone
is a mile back down the hill.

02:32.027 --> 02:33.445
That's an hour hike back up here.

02:33.779 --> 02:36.198
He might not have an hour.
Get your ropes ready.

02:36.281 --> 02:37.532
Wind is at 15 knots.

02:37.616 --> 02:40.035
This goes sideways,
you'll both be lying next to your friend.

02:40.160 --> 02:43.622
That man saved my life.
We leave him here, he dies. Do it!

02:43.914 --> 02:45.123
Your funeral, Doc.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.796
This isn't our smartest decision.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.047
That never stopped us before.

02:53.715 --> 02:55.175
- Ready?
- Yeah.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.300
All right.

03:03.725 --> 03:05.977
News chopper.
Must've followed us out here.

03:06.061 --> 03:07.941
At least we're not working
in complete darkness.

03:12.067 --> 03:14.319
All right, ready?
One, two, three.

03:17.114 --> 03:19.908
Mac, can you hear me?
It's Jordan.

03:19.991 --> 03:20.826
He's breathing.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.536
Respirations are slow and shallow.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.204
Pulse is weak and irregular.

03:24.413 --> 03:26.140
There's no telling
how long he's been like this.

03:26.164 --> 03:27.791
He not gonna get any better out here.

03:28.250 --> 03:29.250
Hey!

03:31.711 --> 03:34.589
Listen to me. You're gonna make it
through this, you hear me?

03:34.673 --> 03:36.258
You're gonna make it through this.

03:40.345 --> 03:44.391
Hey, Scott, I want you to know
that I appreciate you staying on.

03:44.474 --> 03:46.393
Loyalty is an uncommon trait around here.

03:46.476 --> 03:47.602
I made a commitment.

03:47.686 --> 03:50.564
So did the others,
but most of them just cut and run.

03:50.689 --> 03:52.289
Even those who should have known better.

03:52.357 --> 03:54.609
As far as I'm concerned,
Jordan's dead to me.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.278
Topher meant a lot to this place.

03:56.445 --> 03:59.072
Sometimes emotions get involved
and judgment gets blurred.

03:59.156 --> 04:01.241
That it does.
Look, Scott.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.102
I'm going to have to close the ER.

04:03.577 --> 04:06.037
More people uninsured than ever,
higher costs.

04:06.580 --> 04:07.789
The numbers just don't add up.

04:09.291 --> 04:13.044
This community here, all of these people,
they're not just numbers.

04:13.128 --> 04:14.838
Look, save me the bleeding heart speech.

04:15.714 --> 04:20.260
I grew up in circumstances where access
to medicine was a swig of Robitussin.

04:21.094 --> 04:25.140
I understand what's at stake, but this ER
could take down the entire hospital.

04:25.223 --> 04:26.558
Okay, so what's the plan?

04:27.267 --> 04:28.267
All right.

04:28.852 --> 04:32.564
SAM gets transformed
into a specialty surgical center,

04:32.647 --> 04:33.690
with you at the helm.

04:33.857 --> 04:35.025
My name, your face.

04:35.567 --> 04:36.847
You could write your own ticket.

04:37.319 --> 04:38.653
That's certainly tempting.

04:38.737 --> 04:40.030
Yeah. All cards on the table.

04:40.530 --> 04:41.782
I reviewed your record.

04:42.157 --> 04:45.160
Bounced from Dallas to San Antonio,

04:45.243 --> 04:46.843
Are you really considering another move?

04:48.205 --> 04:51.541
I'm keeping all my options open right now.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.044
Yeah. Piece of advice,

04:54.127 --> 04:55.712
a tree with no roots can't grow.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.089
Might be time to put some down again.

04:59.257 --> 05:00.257
Think on it.

05:01.885 --> 05:04.346
<i>Pathologist needed
in Tech Room 4.</i>

05:09.017 --> 05:09.851
- Jordan?
<i>- Hey.</i>

05:09.935 --> 05:10.935
We found Mac.

05:11.645 --> 05:12.729
He's alive?

05:12.813 --> 05:13.647
Barely.

05:13.814 --> 05:16.233
We're in a chopper over the burn area.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.859
<i>A search plane spotted three fires</i>

05:17.943 --> 05:19.736
<i>and Drew knew
that it's symbol for distress.</i>

05:19.820 --> 05:22.572
We're bringing him in now
and I'm not taking "no" for an answer.

05:22.697 --> 05:23.697
<i>I gotta go.</i>

05:24.783 --> 05:26.117
Something's wrong.

05:26.201 --> 05:27.327
I can't get a temperature.

05:28.036 --> 05:29.329
There it is. Osborn wave.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.248
Yeah, he's too cold.
We gotta warm him up.

05:32.123 --> 05:33.883
- Liter of warm saline.
- Heating packs. Hey.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Hey, Mac.

05:35.752 --> 05:36.836
No, no, no.

05:36.962 --> 05:39.339
Paradoxical undressing,
he's got severe hypothermia.

05:39.631 --> 05:40.631
Turn him. He's gonna...

05:42.551 --> 05:44.594
Step on the gas,
we need to get to SAM ASAP.

05:44.678 --> 05:45.780
That's going to be a problem, Doc.

05:45.804 --> 05:48.557
I don't have the fuel to get us there
and the wind isn't helping.

05:48.765 --> 05:51.393
Then you better find another ER
or he's not going to make it.

06:16.626 --> 06:19.087
Easy. Easy, easy, easy.
We're here to help.

06:21.506 --> 06:23.592
You're bleeding. Let me treat you.

06:28.597 --> 06:29.598
What's your name?

06:29.681 --> 06:30.681
TC.

06:31.016 --> 06:33.643
You're lucky, TC.
Most don't survive what you did.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.312
Well...

06:35.395 --> 06:36.395
I'm Amira.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.526
Let me see your hand.

06:44.487 --> 06:45.572
Leave it in or take it out?

06:46.114 --> 06:47.114
Take it...

06:48.825 --> 06:49.951
Thanks for the warning.

06:53.330 --> 06:57.334
Free Syrian Army or Kurdish PYD?

06:58.418 --> 07:00.295
We are both... and neither.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.340
Doctors. Bakers. Mechanics.

07:03.923 --> 07:06.301
Concerned citizens lending helping hands
to those in need.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.260
This is Syria.

07:07.344 --> 07:11.264
You might want to help yourself
and find a weapon for protection.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.976
These are the only weapons I need.
Now let me treat you.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.645
It's fine. I'm a doctor.

07:17.354 --> 07:19.064
Apparently not a very good one.

07:19.147 --> 07:21.232
You have multiple lacerations
and ruptured TM.

07:21.358 --> 07:22.400
I'll live.

07:22.776 --> 07:25.111
I need to find my friend. Um...

07:25.862 --> 07:28.698
Her name's Syd Jennings.
She's a doctor, like me.

07:29.157 --> 07:31.409
Five-ten, level-headed.

07:32.035 --> 07:33.036
You know, smart mouth.

07:33.119 --> 07:35.080
So doctor isn't the only thing
you have in common?

07:35.872 --> 07:37.082
I need to find her.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.793
We've done three rescues today
and found no women.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.911
I don't know where she is.
And I doubt anyone else does.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.305
He does.

07:54.432 --> 07:56.309
Aah!

08:02.190 --> 08:03.316
Shall we continue our tour?

08:03.400 --> 08:05.110
Yeah, Sorry. Thought you'd be gone longer.

08:05.193 --> 08:07.654
No, the line at the ladies' was epic.
I decided to hold it.

08:07.779 --> 08:09.173
Arts and crafts kinda guy, are you?

08:09.197 --> 08:10.573
Palo Fierro. Reminds me of home.

08:10.657 --> 08:11.491
Where's that?

08:11.574 --> 08:12.659
Little town down south.

08:12.742 --> 08:14.786
South of San Antonio?
Must be pretty small.

08:16.037 --> 08:17.765
- Thanks for showing me around.
- Thanks for pitching in.

08:17.789 --> 08:18.891
The few of us on the regular staff

08:18.915 --> 08:20.792
who stayed on here
are working double shifts.

08:20.875 --> 08:22.144
We appreciate any help we can get.

08:22.168 --> 08:23.169
Glad to be of service.

08:23.253 --> 08:24.814
We don't get a lot of travelers
around here.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.172
Not until recently anyway.

08:26.881 --> 08:29.443
Different hospitals, procedures,
people every shift. Must be tough.

08:29.467 --> 08:30.760
It suits me.

08:30.885 --> 08:32.470
Get off me!

08:32.554 --> 08:34.054
They're eating my toes!

08:34.139 --> 08:35.807
Give him the ten of Valium IV.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.018
Who have we got, Sara?

08:38.101 --> 08:38.977
I'm not sure, no I.D.

08:39.059 --> 08:41.371
Someone called in a complaint that this
guy Melvin was busting up a laundromat.

08:41.395 --> 08:42.856
- This guy does laundry?
- No ways.

08:42.938 --> 08:44.291
I said he was there,
not what he was doing.

08:44.315 --> 08:45.876
Punched out a few windows
before we subdued him.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.044
Caught a piece of you too, huh?

08:47.068 --> 08:48.695
If I need stitches, I'm gonna be pissed.

08:48.778 --> 08:51.489
Seems like a standard OD.
Bath salts, maybe PCP.

08:58.163 --> 08:59.163
Back off.

09:00.206 --> 09:01.207
- Get away.
- Calm down.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.418
I'll kill you. Kill you all.

09:04.169 --> 09:05.295
Cain, let's go.

09:05.378 --> 09:06.421
Get out of my head.

09:09.090 --> 09:10.090
Get off of me.

09:13.928 --> 09:16.556
Welcome to the night shift.
Think you're gonna fit right in.

09:19.184 --> 09:22.312
Look, I'm not trying to salt your game,
are you sure this is cool with Shannon?

09:22.604 --> 09:23.980
It will be.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.698
You're actually helping me out
by splitting the utilities and the rent.

09:28.109 --> 09:30.028
Now that I'm as broke as you.

09:30.153 --> 09:31.654
Broke is better than in debt.

09:31.863 --> 09:34.240
One last chance to talk you
out of going into work here.

09:34.741 --> 09:35.950
That ship's sailed, man.

09:36.076 --> 09:39.579
If you walk through those doors tonight,
it'll be like you're betraying Topher

09:39.871 --> 09:41.474
and I am not the only one
who will see it that way.

09:41.498 --> 09:43.225
Do you think I wanna just
walk back in there?

09:43.249 --> 09:45.752
Look, I love Topher like a brother, man,
but he's a doc.

09:45.835 --> 09:47.435
He'll land on his feet wherever he goes.

09:48.129 --> 09:51.341
I go on a job search now, it could take me
a month to find one, maybe more.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.675
I don't have a month, Paul.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.803
Besides, I gotta pay my
new landlord somehow, right?

10:00.350 --> 10:01.434
Damn, Squealer.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.746
Man, your dad will do anything
to get you back to work.

10:03.770 --> 10:04.770
Funny.

10:07.899 --> 10:09.567
Multiple GSWs to the abdomen.

10:09.692 --> 10:10.735
Get us a gurney over here.

10:10.819 --> 10:11.819
Gurney.

10:11.945 --> 10:12.779
Is this a friend of yours?

10:12.862 --> 10:14.590
No, we were in the parking lot
when somebody dumped him.

10:14.614 --> 10:15.824
You guys back?

10:16.825 --> 10:17.742
- I am.
- Great.

10:17.826 --> 10:19.369
That IV isn't gonna start itself.

10:19.869 --> 10:20.995
- Paul?
- No.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.873
Okay. We got it from here.

10:23.957 --> 10:24.957
Straight to the OR.

10:25.208 --> 10:26.852
I think the bullet
pierced his small intestine...

10:26.876 --> 10:27.877
Paul, I said we got it.

10:31.506 --> 10:32.590
Hey, Shannon. Got a minute?

10:32.674 --> 10:33.925
I haven't had a second to pee.

10:34.008 --> 10:35.027
Right. Just real quick, I...

10:35.051 --> 10:36.051
Later, Paul.

10:52.777 --> 10:56.781
Let me go! Let me go!
They're chewing my toes! Let me go!

10:56.906 --> 10:57.740
We're here to help you, sir.

10:57.866 --> 10:58.866
I need to battle!

10:59.075 --> 11:00.803
Y'all let me battle
or there'll be hell to pay!

11:00.827 --> 11:02.287
Calm down, sir.

11:02.370 --> 11:04.372
I gotta bring the noise, bitch!
I'm a musician!

11:04.455 --> 11:05.874
Yeah, and I'm Ray Charles.

11:05.957 --> 11:07.125
Hey!

11:09.377 --> 11:11.796
Sir, we need you to calm down.

11:13.923 --> 11:15.341
Okay. Okay.

11:26.394 --> 11:27.454
Didn't realize you were back.

11:27.478 --> 11:28.855
Yeah, it feels like I never left.

11:28.980 --> 11:30.916
But you did and when the others find out
you crossed early,

11:30.940 --> 11:32.220
you might get a matching shiner.

11:32.859 --> 11:33.859
Brave talk, Doc.

11:33.985 --> 11:36.105
Where was all this courage
when Topher got fired, huh?

11:36.988 --> 11:38.531
Thank you for the help. I'm Cain.

11:38.615 --> 11:40.450
Kenny. What's up with music lover here?

11:40.617 --> 11:42.952
PCP. Angel dust. Clicker. Dragon Rock.
Take your pick.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.829
- Did he get any sedation?
- Ten of Valium.

11:44.913 --> 11:46.473
All right, he's a big boy.
Maybe it's time for another dose.

11:46.497 --> 11:47.624
Cain, give him another ten.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.643
I gave him ten milligrams IM
when he pulled out his IV.

11:49.667 --> 11:51.085
Perhaps we should let it work, no?

11:51.169 --> 11:53.421
This guy punched Sara
and almost ripped my head off.

11:53.504 --> 11:54.690
How much longer do you want to wait?

11:54.714 --> 11:56.049
Ten of Valium going in.
Watch out.

12:02.972 --> 12:03.973
Check it out, Cain.

12:04.098 --> 12:05.492
You're a temp nurse. She's a doctor.

12:05.516 --> 12:07.268
Do as you're told.
This isn't a debate club.

12:15.735 --> 12:16.736
He's still cold.

12:16.819 --> 12:18.179
The arrhythmia was from rewarming.

12:18.237 --> 12:20.281
GI blood from
hypothermia induced Coagulopathy.

12:20.365 --> 12:21.425
We need to rewarm him faster.

12:21.449 --> 12:24.619
Excuse me, Doctor, we just airlifted a vet
and he's in really bad shape.

12:24.702 --> 12:26.462
We could use a need a nurse
and a resus room.

12:26.579 --> 12:27.747
Uh, take a number.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.808
This is the hero from the fire
who's been missing for two days.

12:29.832 --> 12:32.227
He's in stage III hypothermia.
We need to rewarm him right now.

12:32.251 --> 12:34.396
There's some space
right over here in the hallway. Okay?

12:34.420 --> 12:35.630
Are you freaking kidding me?

12:35.755 --> 12:36.839
Unfortunately, I'm not.

12:37.548 --> 12:40.259
Honestly, this is the last place
you should've brought your friend.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.229
Nice speech the other night, Paul.

12:51.521 --> 12:52.689
I didn't come to talk to you.

12:53.231 --> 12:54.231
But you will.

12:54.732 --> 12:57.360
Step foot in my hospital
and you will show respect.

12:57.527 --> 12:59.195
Look at me when I speak to you.

13:02.740 --> 13:03.950
I'm glad you came in tonight.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.661
You get to see
what your little rebellion reaped.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.871
I've had to hire temps to run this place.

13:08.997 --> 13:10.623
I haven't left myself in two days.

13:10.707 --> 13:11.916
I didn't make you fire Topher.

13:12.083 --> 13:14.502
No, incompetence and lack of leadership
took care of that.

13:16.254 --> 13:17.254
You know what?

13:17.630 --> 13:19.048
If you want to talk, let's talk.

13:19.298 --> 13:21.694
But I won't stand here while you yell
at me like some whipping boy, all right?

13:21.718 --> 13:23.011
What are you going to do, Paul?

13:23.136 --> 13:24.136
Walk off?

13:24.303 --> 13:25.303
Again?

13:25.847 --> 13:27.473
Leave the people of this community

13:27.557 --> 13:30.768
you said you care so much about
in the lurch, again.

13:32.186 --> 13:34.897
Well, in the real world,
your actions have consequences.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.232
So do yours.

13:36.441 --> 13:38.317
And that's the only point
I was trying to make.

13:38.609 --> 13:40.820
There are things about this place
and these people

13:40.903 --> 13:42.321
that are more valuable than money.

13:43.197 --> 13:45.676
And if you had just asked,
I would've gladly explained that to you.

13:45.700 --> 13:48.161
You know what? I blame myself.

13:48.327 --> 13:50.079
I didn't teach you how to fail.

13:50.288 --> 13:54.667
Well here's your first lesson.
Son, it's never too late to learn.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.586
Now you gotta leave.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.065
Yeah, I'm gonna check on my patient...

14:00.089 --> 14:01.299
You mean Scott's patient.

14:01.382 --> 14:03.009
You don't work here anymore, remember?

14:03.551 --> 14:04.844
Now get washed up and go.

14:05.219 --> 14:08.264
These facilities are for employees only.

14:27.909 --> 14:29.702
What's your name?

14:29.786 --> 14:32.330
This man held you captive
and now you treat him?

14:32.413 --> 14:34.582
He's jihadist scum who deserves to die.

14:34.665 --> 14:37.502
Maybe. But right now
he's my only chance at finding Syd.

14:42.048 --> 14:44.634
Okay.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.135
Your kneecap is dislocated.

14:46.219 --> 14:47.780
I got to pop it in
or you won't be able to walk.

14:47.804 --> 14:50.848
You're an infidel.
I want nothing from you.

14:50.932 --> 14:52.683
If I don't treat you, then she will.

14:52.809 --> 14:53.893
I'm not helping him.

14:53.976 --> 14:55.895
He's not gonna like it
anymore than you will.

14:56.396 --> 14:59.273
Look, just gradually extend the leg
while I applying medial...

15:01.067 --> 15:02.819
pressure to the patella.

15:11.536 --> 15:12.787
Must be from the bombing.

15:13.371 --> 15:14.932
We gotta stop the bleeding
or he's gonna die.

15:14.956 --> 15:15.956
Let him.

15:16.374 --> 15:19.043
He and his people killed our families
and friends, maybe yours too.

15:19.127 --> 15:21.838
Maybe. But he's the only one
who knows where Syd might be.

15:22.004 --> 15:23.714
How do you know
you're not chasing a ghost?

15:25.716 --> 15:28.556
Because I haven't seen a body,
and I don't give leave my friends behind.

15:28.636 --> 15:30.471
I'm going to rescue
those who are deserving.

15:30.888 --> 15:32.241
If you'd like to show some gratitude,

15:32.265 --> 15:34.642
you can join me instead of
wasting time on him.

15:45.528 --> 15:47.447
Dr. Rivera! He's bucking the vent.

15:47.530 --> 15:49.282
Dr. Rivera!

15:49.615 --> 15:50.908
I need a doctor now.

15:51.576 --> 15:54.287
<i>Dr. Rivera
to trauma ward. Dr. Rivera to...</i>

15:54.370 --> 15:58.166
I'm going to help you,
but before I remove the tube,

15:59.208 --> 16:03.129
I must deflate the balloon that's holding
it in your throat. Okay? You understand?

16:03.796 --> 16:07.467
<i>Dr. Rivera to trauma ward.
Dr. Rivera to trauma ward.</i>

16:07.592 --> 16:09.844
Here you go. All right.

16:17.101 --> 16:18.186
Thank you.

16:19.061 --> 16:20.771
Water. Water please.

16:24.275 --> 16:27.528
He was in distress,
he was gagging and bucking the vent.

16:27.612 --> 16:29.947
So you pulled out his ET tube?
Why didn't you call me?

16:30.031 --> 16:31.031
I did.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.534
Then you should've called
for another doctor.

16:36.454 --> 16:37.788
Why am I in the hospital?

16:38.080 --> 16:39.624
You OD'd on narcotics.

16:40.458 --> 16:41.459
I don't do drugs.

16:41.542 --> 16:43.127
Well, your violent behavior disagrees.

16:43.211 --> 16:46.255
Last thing I remember,
I was eating pizza and doing laundry.

16:46.589 --> 16:47.798
Laundry at midnight?

16:48.007 --> 16:49.967
I keep odd hours because of my work.

16:50.968 --> 16:52.094
I'm a cellist.

16:53.638 --> 16:54.931
My cello is my life.

16:55.223 --> 16:56.974
My neighbor hates when I practice.

16:57.767 --> 16:59.393
So I play wherever I can.

17:00.061 --> 17:02.855
A cellist? Well, that's a new one.

17:04.523 --> 17:05.566
Relax, Melvin.

17:09.278 --> 17:12.406
Practicing cello in flip flops and sweats
at a laundromat?

17:12.531 --> 17:14.450
He seems well groomed for an addict, no?

17:14.534 --> 17:17.078
Dr. Rivera. Perhaps we should listen
to what he's trying to say.

17:17.203 --> 17:21.040
I don't know what ER's you've worked at,
but I see this all the time around here.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.041
Way too much in the last 20 hours.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.169
Every addict has a habit and a story.

17:25.336 --> 17:28.965
And one more thing,
you never extubated that patient.

17:29.257 --> 17:30.091
- Got it?
- Yeah.

17:30.258 --> 17:31.634
You could get us both fired.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.139
Let me holler at you for a sec.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.439
- Hey.
- How's my squealer?

17:46.482 --> 17:49.652
Well, the bullet penetrated the IVC
so we had to a...

17:49.777 --> 17:51.362
Pringle maneuver. I knew it.

17:52.530 --> 17:54.115
Anyway, he'll make it.

17:56.242 --> 17:57.326
So my...

17:57.827 --> 17:59.537
My dad back up the truck for you?

18:00.955 --> 18:01.998
He backed up two.

18:03.374 --> 18:06.961
You know, Paul, when you left,
you didn't just walk out on your father,

18:08.296 --> 18:09.422
you walked out on me.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.883
Scott, it was, uh, heat of the moment,
you know.

18:13.426 --> 18:14.426
Yeah.

18:16.596 --> 18:17.805
But I guess I kinda did.

18:19.515 --> 18:20.515
Sorry.

18:22.685 --> 18:24.520
Hmm. That's all in the past now.

18:26.188 --> 18:27.982
So what are your plan for the future?

18:28.899 --> 18:31.694
I guess to try and find residency
at another hospital.

18:31.777 --> 18:33.279
No guarantees of that.

18:33.404 --> 18:36.157
And even if you get one,
you're gonna lose a year at best.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.075
At worst, you're starting completely over.

18:39.702 --> 18:41.329
I hadn't really thought of that.

18:42.079 --> 18:44.519
Seems like you haven't been doing
much thinking at all lately.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.462
Look, Paul, come back here.

18:49.837 --> 18:51.631
You work for me, not your father.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.634
We can still do
some great medicine together.

18:55.343 --> 18:56.343
I can't.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.222
I have to make a stand somewhere.

19:05.102 --> 19:06.854
I just hope you know
where you're standing.

19:12.109 --> 19:13.587
What the hell you thinking,
extubating a patient?

19:13.611 --> 19:16.197
We don't do that procedure
without an order from a doctor.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.699
I called for Dr. Rivera, any other doctor,
no one came.

19:18.824 --> 19:20.302
Well, then you
and physically go and get one.

19:20.326 --> 19:21.327
I didn't have time.

19:21.452 --> 19:23.579
And what if he had lost his airway, huh?
What then?

19:23.954 --> 19:24.789
I'll tell you what.

19:24.914 --> 19:26.725
It would've been Dr. Rivera
who would've been held accountable.

19:26.749 --> 19:27.869
I was trying to protect her.

19:27.917 --> 19:30.378
You're a nurse and a temp one at that.

19:31.045 --> 19:32.338
Do your job.

19:33.130 --> 19:35.841
I don't know who you are
or where you came from...

19:36.842 --> 19:37.885
but I'm watching you.

19:47.061 --> 19:48.521
Second liter of warm saline is in.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.398
Temperature is up to 86.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.025
He's waking up.

19:55.111 --> 19:56.278
Hi, Mac! How you doing?

19:56.696 --> 19:57.696
Jordan?

19:58.030 --> 19:59.030
Drew?

19:59.490 --> 20:00.783
You must have quite a story.

20:02.702 --> 20:05.162
I used the ridge as a handrail,

20:06.038 --> 20:07.832
made my way for the Pakistani border.

20:08.499 --> 20:12.128
I went as far as I could and
then I lit the fires and just waited.

20:13.671 --> 20:14.672
He's hallucinating.

20:15.548 --> 20:18.634
Mac, you're in San Antonio.

20:20.428 --> 20:22.179
This isn't San Antonio Memorial.

20:22.805 --> 20:23.931
Where the hell am I?

20:24.014 --> 20:25.391
It's okay. We got you.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.727
This is the friggin' V.A.

20:27.810 --> 20:29.788
This is the exact place I told you
I didn't want to end up.

20:29.812 --> 20:30.896
Mac, you gotta relax.

20:30.980 --> 20:32.690
How can I relax when...

20:33.190 --> 20:35.568
He's seizing. Uh, nurse, some Ativan.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.695
Hey, Doc. Hey.

20:38.112 --> 20:40.698
Our guy probably has a bleed,
he needs a scan. Now.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.867
- CT is down and there's no MRI.
- Come on, come on.

20:42.992 --> 20:45.870
The V.A. stands for Veterans Affairs
or did you forget that?

20:45.953 --> 20:48.539
Your job is to help veterans,
not leave them hanging out to dry.

20:48.622 --> 20:51.333
Look, I'm here with
my floor nurse doing triage,

20:51.417 --> 20:52.644
who, by the way, is trying to help you.

20:52.668 --> 20:54.688
- Here you go.
- It's just the two of us here, okay?

20:54.712 --> 20:56.630
So before you tell me what my job is,

20:56.714 --> 20:58.674
maybe you wanna grab some scrubs
and jump in.

20:59.175 --> 21:00.301
Jordan, he's tubed.

21:01.969 --> 21:04.322
The seizures have stopped but we're
on borrowed time. What's the plan?

21:04.346 --> 21:06.849
Julian is the only doctor
who has a shot at saving him.

21:07.808 --> 21:10.060
He hates your guts right now.
You can't make him operate.

21:10.144 --> 21:11.687
Yeah? Watch me.

21:13.814 --> 21:15.024
What's wrong with him?

21:15.399 --> 21:18.277
The rebar has punctured
his abdominal cavity.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.987
So he's slowly bleeding out.

21:20.154 --> 21:23.240
Slowly if the tear doesn't get bigger,
then it's more like a couple hours.

21:23.324 --> 21:25.884
Which is why I need to stabilize the rebar
to buy some more time.

21:27.661 --> 21:30.247
You know, I really could use a hand.

21:42.009 --> 21:43.260
I brought more help.

21:43.344 --> 21:44.970
They don't look like doctors.

21:45.054 --> 21:46.472
I can vouch for their efficacy.

21:47.348 --> 21:49.600
Did you stabilize him just so
you guys could torture him?

21:51.227 --> 21:52.311
He's a jihadist.

21:52.978 --> 21:54.980
And he knows
where other jihadists are hiding.

21:55.064 --> 21:56.482
If you kill him,

21:56.565 --> 22:00.152
you don't get no intel on the Caliphate
and I don't get any info on Syd.

22:01.028 --> 22:02.214
So nobody gets what they want.

22:02.238 --> 22:03.572
A chance we'll have to take.

22:06.158 --> 22:08.118
No. No, listen.

22:30.391 --> 22:33.894
Here he is, everyone, the man of the hour,
Dr. Julian Cummings.

22:33.978 --> 22:39.650
He's agreed to perform lifesaving surgery
on Team Rubicon hero and vet, Mac Riley.

22:39.733 --> 22:40.818
Dr. Cummings! Is it true?

22:40.901 --> 22:42.570
Does he have a chance? Can you save him?

22:42.653 --> 22:44.214
You don't know
who you're messing with, Doctor.

22:44.238 --> 22:46.240
I don't appreciate being manipulated.

22:46.323 --> 22:48.993
Yes, um, I will perform the surgery.

22:49.451 --> 22:52.121
There's a new regime here
at San Antonio Memorial.

22:52.204 --> 22:55.416
And we'd like nothing more
than to serve those who have served us.

22:55.499 --> 22:58.294
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a surgery to prepare for.

22:58.419 --> 23:00.397
- When will he be out of surgery?
- Where did you find him?

23:00.421 --> 23:02.107
- That's enough. Let's go.
- Can we have an update?

23:02.131 --> 23:03.358
When we have an update,
you 'll be the first to know.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.360
- Until then, out of the OR, let's go.
- Do you think he'll survive?

23:05.384 --> 23:06.885
Can we get a statement from you?

23:06.969 --> 23:08.304
Chilly in here tonight.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.931
I got orderlies giving me stink eye,
docs giving me lip,

23:11.307 --> 23:12.891
traveling nurses trying to flex.

23:12.975 --> 23:14.226
I know what you mean, man.

23:14.310 --> 23:16.604
Two days ago I'm a hero,
now everybody's upset.

23:16.687 --> 23:19.189
My dad, Scott, maybe even Shannon.

23:19.857 --> 23:21.937
Man, stay strong.
Stick together, we'll be all right.

23:21.984 --> 23:22.984
Hey.

23:24.028 --> 23:25.237
Are you guys back?

23:25.863 --> 23:26.863
Kenny is.

23:26.905 --> 23:28.282
So much for staying strong, Paul.

23:29.074 --> 23:30.743
Uh, dude, what's with the eye?

23:33.370 --> 23:35.497
Just errant elbow in a pick-up game.

23:35.581 --> 23:36.957
What are you guys doing here?

23:37.541 --> 23:40.127
Hey, didn't know we were having a reunion.

23:40.586 --> 23:42.004
It's almost like everyone's back.

23:42.087 --> 23:43.922
- Yeah, almost.
- Yeah, almost.

23:44.006 --> 23:47.301
There's been a major accident
at the Lone Star Amusement Park.

23:47.384 --> 23:50.304
They're asking for any and all
first responders across the city.

23:50.387 --> 23:51.387
Lone star?

23:51.472 --> 23:53.825
Rick and Bri are there
with Armed Services tonight. I gotta go.

23:53.849 --> 23:54.849
Yeah, count me in.

23:54.892 --> 23:56.352
I gotta stay here with Mac.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.355
Can you make sure
he gets fast-tracked to the OR?

23:58.437 --> 24:00.397
- I'm on it.
- Better get ready to receive.

24:01.273 --> 24:04.985
I hear the cello is the closest sounding
instrument to the human voice.

24:05.277 --> 24:06.153
Is that true, Melvin?

24:06.236 --> 24:07.321
Yeah, that's true.

24:07.655 --> 24:09.490
See, if you heard it, you'd understand,

24:09.573 --> 24:11.158
I'd never risk losing that gift.

24:11.325 --> 24:13.535
So you're not a substance abuser?

24:13.661 --> 24:16.455
Said I didn't take any drugs,
never said I was without sin.

24:18.248 --> 24:21.126
I've been known to hit the bottle
when my life hit a wolf tone or two.

24:21.377 --> 24:22.211
A "wolf tone"?

24:22.378 --> 24:25.047
It's when the frequencies of the strings
and body of the cello

24:25.172 --> 24:27.049
produce this artificial overtones.

24:27.383 --> 24:29.343
Sounds like an animal crying for help.

24:29.885 --> 24:32.304
Throws a sound, harmony
and everything else out of whack.

24:32.429 --> 24:33.972
What is the remedy for this wolf tone?

24:34.306 --> 24:36.684
A stabilizer.
Puts pressure on the strings.

24:37.101 --> 24:40.145
Keeps everything where it should be,
straight and on point.

24:40.896 --> 24:42.523
That's what my cello does for me.

24:42.773 --> 24:46.318
Look, I'm sorry for any trouble
I've caused, but that wasn't me.

24:47.027 --> 24:50.906
I have a video audition in the morning,
the European Opera Orchestra.

24:50.989 --> 24:53.617
It has twelve chairs
and one just opened a week ago.

24:54.535 --> 24:57.955
This is a once in a lifetime opportunity
for me and I can't miss it.

24:58.622 --> 24:59.957
Can you please just let me go?

25:00.082 --> 25:03.419
No, you're still groggy.
We need to watch you a little longer.

25:08.215 --> 25:09.299
Dr. Rivera...

25:10.759 --> 25:12.720
do you think a junkie knows
what a wolf tone is?

25:14.304 --> 25:15.347
I guess not.

25:15.431 --> 25:16.765
While treating his cuts,

25:16.849 --> 25:18.892
what's the one thing
you didn't notice on his arms?

25:19.518 --> 25:20.352
Track marks.

25:20.436 --> 25:22.479
In fact, there's no evidence
of drug use whatsoever.

25:23.272 --> 25:25.649
Sometimes, we must look beyond
what we've already seen.

25:40.789 --> 25:42.750
Enjoy your little media stunt?

25:42.916 --> 25:44.126
It wasn't about me.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.587
It was about getting Mac
the care that he needs.

25:49.381 --> 25:52.926
Looks like you were right,
his tumor is hemorrhaging.

25:53.177 --> 25:55.220
He needs surgery or he will die.

25:56.513 --> 25:57.890
His cancer is terminal.

25:58.348 --> 25:59.683
The issue isn't really in doubt.

26:00.350 --> 26:03.061
If he survived an operation,
and that's a big if,

26:03.645 --> 26:07.316
we bought him nine months,
twelve months tops.

26:08.817 --> 26:11.904
That man has given
more of his life serving us.

26:12.029 --> 26:13.906
That may be, but there comes a point

26:13.989 --> 26:16.533
where surgery is no longer feasible
for either party.

26:17.034 --> 26:20.913
So, you're just gonna let this man die
because what?

26:21.747 --> 26:23.665
His bank account's a couple bucks short?

26:25.167 --> 26:26.460
You think you know me?

26:31.465 --> 26:32.465
Read it.

26:38.639 --> 26:43.852
"Dear Dr. Cummings, my name is Jesse,
I am six years old and my mommy is dying.

26:44.269 --> 26:47.731
She has the cancer inside
and I'm writing to ask you if you can..."

26:47.815 --> 26:51.235
"Please save my mommy. Love, Jesse."

26:51.985 --> 26:54.947
Just got this today.
And I have a hundred more just like it.

26:55.781 --> 26:58.200
My books is filled with patients
waiting for surgery,

26:58.283 --> 27:00.744
with stories
just as heartbreaking as that one.

27:00.828 --> 27:01.828
I'm sorry.

27:02.871 --> 27:03.872
I didn't realize that...

27:03.956 --> 27:05.999
That's because you've never
walked in my shoes.

27:07.042 --> 27:08.710
I make hard decisions every day...

27:09.169 --> 27:10.587
deciding who lives and who dies.

27:10.671 --> 27:12.548
So please, tell me,

27:12.631 --> 27:16.134
why should I bump your friend here
ahead of little Jesse's mom?

27:16.468 --> 27:18.262
What do you want?

27:18.554 --> 27:19.554
What I want?

27:20.889 --> 27:22.850
Everyone who left back to work...

27:23.725 --> 27:24.810
with you in charge.

27:25.561 --> 27:27.187
I read your plans from a few years back.

27:27.813 --> 27:30.440
You're not that far off from
what I'd like to do with this place.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.402
Does "everyone" include Topher?

27:33.652 --> 27:35.654
No. It's not a part of the deal.

27:35.779 --> 27:37.573
He's the heart and soul of this hospital.

27:37.656 --> 27:40.993
This hospital doesn't need
a heart and soul, it needs a leader.

27:42.703 --> 27:46.999
So everyone back to work, no Topher,
or I won't operate on your friend.

27:47.833 --> 27:49.001
The ball is in your court.

27:49.835 --> 27:53.130
So do something with it
before my offer expires.

28:15.944 --> 28:17.654
- Any word from Bri?
- No.

28:17.946 --> 28:19.531
Hay. We've been waiting for you guys.

28:19.615 --> 28:22.576
We have ten dead, at least
a dozen with crush fractures and wounds.

28:22.659 --> 28:23.493
What happened?

28:23.660 --> 28:24.494
Still happening.

28:24.620 --> 28:27.414
One of coasters flew off the track,
a second got stuck inverted.

28:28.123 --> 28:29.875
We're getting responders up to them now.

28:30.250 --> 28:31.126
Where do you need us?

28:31.251 --> 28:32.854
Taking care of triage
would be a huge help.

28:32.878 --> 28:34.046
Yeah, we're on it. Uh...

28:38.550 --> 28:40.219
<i>Hey, everybody listen up.</i>

28:40.344 --> 28:42.596
<i>If you can hear me, raise your hand.</i>

28:43.847 --> 28:48.477
<i>If you can walk, head to the entrance,
and wait for treatment.</i>

28:48.560 --> 28:50.479
Paul, can you take this...

28:53.690 --> 28:55.734
Mollie? Please tell me you have Bri.

28:56.318 --> 28:57.361
You do?

28:57.861 --> 28:59.029
Oh, thank God. Okay.

28:59.613 --> 29:00.447
Thank you. Thank you.

29:00.530 --> 29:02.032
And R-Rick's at work?

29:02.532 --> 29:05.994
Okay, all right, um, I got to get going.
Make sure you tell her that I love her.

29:06.203 --> 29:08.747
Okay. All right, yeah, you too. Okay.

29:11.792 --> 29:13.293
It's amazing Mac was still alive.

29:14.419 --> 29:15.419
Yeah.

29:16.129 --> 29:17.339
He's a survivor.

29:20.217 --> 29:21.927
So how about you?
How you doing?

29:22.594 --> 29:24.721
We haven't really talked that much
last few days.

29:24.846 --> 29:26.765
Yeah. Been better.

29:26.890 --> 29:30.143
All of this chaos
and everything that's going on with Annie.

29:31.561 --> 29:32.561
Yeah, how is she doing?

29:32.729 --> 29:34.690
Doing what she needs to do to get by.

29:36.108 --> 29:37.693
Just like everyone else I guess.

29:38.568 --> 29:39.736
Well, what's does that mean?

29:40.028 --> 29:42.489
Well, you came back to work here
without Topher?

29:43.448 --> 29:45.367
So you agreed to Julian's terms, right?

29:47.953 --> 29:48.953
No.

29:49.955 --> 29:50.955
I lied.

29:51.623 --> 29:52.457
What?

29:52.582 --> 29:55.462
I told him what he needed to hear,
just so I can get the surgery for Mac.

29:55.794 --> 29:58.463
Scott, I don't if I can actually
work for that man, I mean...

29:59.756 --> 30:01.717
Especially after what he did to Topher.
I just...

30:02.259 --> 30:03.260
No offense.

30:03.593 --> 30:04.593
Sure.

30:04.970 --> 30:08.223
Lying to Julian, confronting him
in front of the press like that,

30:08.307 --> 30:12.185
you're starting sound a lot less like
Jordan and a lot more like TC.

30:12.853 --> 30:13.687
Yeah.

30:13.812 --> 30:16.165
Well, maybe TC was right more often
than we gave him credit for.

30:16.189 --> 30:17.816
TC is a total pain in the ass.

30:17.899 --> 30:18.984
Yes, he is.

30:19.234 --> 30:22.362
But he gets his patients
the care they need.

30:22.446 --> 30:23.280
Yeah.

30:23.363 --> 30:25.883
I feel like I have been coloring
inside of the lines for so long

30:25.949 --> 30:27.701
and what has it gotten me?

30:28.910 --> 30:30.537
I've been shot at, blown up,

30:31.079 --> 30:32.789
almost killed more times than I can count.

30:32.873 --> 30:35.917
I've lost a baby, sunk relationships.

30:36.293 --> 30:38.420
I feel like maybe
I need to do things differently.

30:39.171 --> 30:40.589
Yeah, not so much for me.

30:42.090 --> 30:44.301
I feel like after everything
this past year,

30:44.384 --> 30:46.053
I just need some stability.

30:46.178 --> 30:48.764
Is that why you hitched your wagon
to Darth Vader over there?

30:51.892 --> 30:53.894
I need to put down some roots.

30:54.227 --> 30:57.397
And, if Julian's the person who's gonna
give me that opportunity to do that,

30:57.481 --> 30:58.690
then, so be it.

30:59.107 --> 31:00.233
If that's okay with you?

31:02.319 --> 31:03.528
Let me go check on Mac.

31:09.659 --> 31:11.495
Hey, thanks for being cool
with everything.

31:11.620 --> 31:13.205
Yeah, who am I to judge?

31:13.622 --> 31:15.791
Besides, you ended up
in the same place as me,

31:15.874 --> 31:17.376
on the inside looking out.

31:18.168 --> 31:19.336
What are you talking about?

31:19.878 --> 31:21.046
The walkout.

31:21.380 --> 31:22.589
What are you talking about?

31:22.714 --> 31:24.174
Our living situation.

31:24.257 --> 31:25.967
You know, all of us being sorta roomies.

31:26.051 --> 31:26.885
Roomies?

31:27.052 --> 31:28.052
Wait.

31:28.970 --> 31:30.263
You're moving in with Paul?

31:30.806 --> 31:31.890
And you too, right?

31:31.973 --> 31:33.350
From what I hear you never leave.

31:33.767 --> 31:34.767
He said that?

31:36.436 --> 31:37.479
Uh, no.

31:37.604 --> 31:38.897
No, I just...

31:39.022 --> 31:40.022
Dr. Rivera,

31:40.524 --> 31:42.025
Melvin's results came back.

31:42.317 --> 31:44.403
Positive for K2, a synthetic marijuana.

31:44.569 --> 31:46.488
Not exactly a news flash, Cain.

31:46.738 --> 31:49.616
I'm more interested in the truth
that's not being seen.

31:49.699 --> 31:50.802
Do we need to have another talk?

31:50.826 --> 31:52.160
Melvin arrived with no I.D.,

31:52.744 --> 31:55.539
so whoever called in the complaint
gave us his name.

31:55.622 --> 31:56.456
Good point.

31:56.540 --> 31:58.580
Melvin also said
he had a problem with his neighbor,

31:58.625 --> 32:00.043
perhaps the neighbor made the call.

32:00.127 --> 32:02.587
Using the police for retribution
is common where I'm from.

32:02.712 --> 32:04.297
So you're a cop and a doctor now?

32:04.506 --> 32:07.384
It would be a shame to see a man's life
ruined because of an assumption.

32:07.843 --> 32:09.636
Especially when a phone call
may clear it up.

32:14.433 --> 32:15.767
Who the hell does he think he is?

32:16.017 --> 32:17.144
Call the cops, Kenny.

32:17.269 --> 32:18.353
Are you serious?

32:18.437 --> 32:19.521
What can it hurt?

32:24.317 --> 32:26.069
Amira! Amira!

32:26.570 --> 32:27.779
Open the damn door!

32:33.452 --> 32:34.703
So that's what you're about?

32:34.828 --> 32:37.414
Rescue people one minute
and just torture them the next?

32:37.497 --> 32:38.748
I didn't torture anyone.

32:39.166 --> 32:41.126
If you didn't stop it,
then you're just as guilty.

32:43.670 --> 32:45.130
They allow me to do my job,

32:45.714 --> 32:46.965
I do not interfere with theirs.

32:47.048 --> 32:48.341
It is the way it's done here.

32:48.467 --> 32:50.218
Maybe that's why
this place is so messed up.

32:50.302 --> 32:51.302
Maybe.

32:52.971 --> 32:54.306
Our spotters just called.

32:54.389 --> 32:56.284
Helicopters took off
from a Syrian airbase nearby.

32:56.308 --> 32:57.588
They're coming to double tap us.

32:57.642 --> 32:58.477
Sounds bad.

32:58.560 --> 33:00.360
They know we rescue
victims of their bombings,

33:00.437 --> 33:02.606
so they send follow up sorties
to target us.

33:03.440 --> 33:06.234
When they arrive,
I suggest you be elsewhere.

33:06.359 --> 33:07.359
Wait.

33:08.653 --> 33:09.863
So where are you going?

33:10.113 --> 33:12.365
We're taking everyone we can
to the base near the border.

33:12.991 --> 33:13.825
What base?

33:13.909 --> 33:15.509
The one that's not supposed to be there.

33:17.621 --> 33:18.663
Come with us.

33:19.372 --> 33:20.624
I can't leave Syd behind.

33:21.082 --> 33:22.435
My gut tells that she's still alive.

33:22.459 --> 33:23.936
And he's the only chance I got
of finding her.

33:23.960 --> 33:26.338
Following your gut out here
is what gets people killed.

33:29.841 --> 33:31.134
He had it in his pocket.

33:33.261 --> 33:34.095
Look familiar?

33:34.179 --> 33:35.597
Yeah, this belongs to Syd.

33:37.557 --> 33:39.197
She was wearing it when we were captured.

33:39.684 --> 33:41.102
Then you're on the right track,

33:41.394 --> 33:43.230
but you may not like
what's at the end of it.

33:56.993 --> 33:57.993
Good luck.

34:01.623 --> 34:03.250
Hey, stay with me.

34:03.708 --> 34:05.377
You wanna stay alive, stay with me.

34:08.547 --> 34:10.422
Okay, you hear that chopper?

34:10.590 --> 34:12.193
They're here to bomb anything that moves.

34:12.217 --> 34:14.969
Take me to my friend
or I will leave you here to die.

34:16.554 --> 34:17.639
What's it gonna be?

34:19.431 --> 34:20.641
What's it gonna be?

34:29.109 --> 34:31.319
We got fractured pelvis.
Let's get a binder on her.

34:31.402 --> 34:32.529
He's urgent surgical. Go.

34:32.612 --> 34:33.612
We got a problem, Docs.

34:33.697 --> 34:35.174
Got two girls left in the coaster
upside down.

34:35.197 --> 34:36.551
Paramedics want one of you
to come take a look.

34:36.574 --> 34:38.302
- What did he say about them?
- He said if he takes one girl down,

34:38.326 --> 34:39.804
the other one is coming
with her in pieces.

34:39.828 --> 34:41.580
- Okay, I'll do it.
- No, I'll go.

34:41.663 --> 34:43.290
Look. Think about Bri, Drew. All right.

34:43.373 --> 34:44.891
You're a father now,
you shouldn't go up there.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.726
That's exactly why I gotta go
because I'm a father now

34:46.751 --> 34:48.043
and those are somebody's kids.

34:48.128 --> 34:49.670
All right. What do you want me to do?

34:50.297 --> 34:51.464
Prepare for the worst.

34:57.178 --> 34:58.578
Did you get anything from the cops?

34:58.847 --> 35:00.640
Yeah. As a matter of fact, I did.

35:00.724 --> 35:01.725
Um...

35:01.850 --> 35:04.185
They checked the security footage
at the laundromat

35:04.394 --> 35:06.396
Melvin's neighbor came in
right after he did.

35:06.521 --> 35:08.040
He got scared when police questioned him,

35:08.064 --> 35:11.192
and confessed to spiking Melvin's pizza
when he wasn't looking.

35:13.737 --> 35:15.155
Guess I was wrong about him.

35:15.447 --> 35:16.698
You're not the only one.

35:17.365 --> 35:19.409
I was tired,
on the back end of a double shift,

35:19.534 --> 35:21.244
and just assumed the worst of him.

35:21.911 --> 35:24.289
Maybe we can make it up to him.

35:24.372 --> 35:25.372
How?

35:25.707 --> 35:29.210
Bad neighbor and tainted pizza
weren't the only things the cops found.

35:31.087 --> 35:32.797
Maybe he can make that audition after all.

35:37.385 --> 35:38.385
He'll live...

35:39.304 --> 35:40.304
For now.

35:42.182 --> 35:45.143
Thank you, Dr. Cummings, I appreciate it.

35:45.393 --> 35:46.603
Funny way of showing it.

35:49.105 --> 35:50.440
You're not coming back, are you?

35:52.776 --> 35:54.402
Never intended to either, did you?

35:57.656 --> 35:59.282
Integrity matters, Jordan.

36:00.700 --> 36:01.701
I agree.

36:02.911 --> 36:06.498
That's why I kept mine with my patient
and he will live to fight another day.

36:08.458 --> 36:09.918
Medicine matters to me.

36:11.044 --> 36:13.421
Not... money.

36:14.422 --> 36:17.008
Easy to say for those
who aren't stuck with the tab.

36:17.258 --> 36:18.258
Hey.

36:18.885 --> 36:20.345
I know the numbers for this place.

36:20.470 --> 36:22.597
All right? I know that they don't add up.

36:23.056 --> 36:26.601
I think I have figured out a way
that we can not only pay our bills,

36:26.685 --> 36:28.687
but make this place profitable again

36:29.604 --> 36:32.482
and we can give the care to the community
that it deserves.

36:32.774 --> 36:34.484
Why would I believe a word you say?

36:36.236 --> 36:37.529
I don't need you to believe.

36:38.321 --> 36:39.155
Just listen.

36:39.322 --> 36:42.158
I made some calls
and The Veterans Administration,

36:42.492 --> 36:45.745
they're looking for private hospitals
to take on their backlogged patients.

36:45.995 --> 36:47.872
We can barely treat the patients we have.

36:47.956 --> 36:49.082
Why would I want more?

36:49.290 --> 36:50.667
The VA pays for them.

36:50.792 --> 36:53.461
Which means you will have
a steady flow of patients and money.

36:53.753 --> 36:55.714
And those government checks,
they don't bounce.

36:56.381 --> 36:57.400
All right, just think about it.

36:57.424 --> 36:59.676
You saved San Antonio Memorial Hospital

36:59.759 --> 37:02.887
and you performed a life-saving surgery
on a war hero.

37:04.639 --> 37:08.351
Becoming part of an initiative
that will help veterans in need,

37:10.103 --> 37:13.606
I think that caps off a pretty good
first week for Cummings Medical Group.

37:13.982 --> 37:14.982
Yes, it does.

37:15.483 --> 37:17.527
But I live
where the rubber meets the road.

37:17.861 --> 37:19.612
And I don't know much about the VA.

37:19.863 --> 37:20.989
It could get messy.

37:21.281 --> 37:23.491
And I don't like messy.

37:23.575 --> 37:25.785
I'll steer the ship
and I'll aid in the transition.

37:26.786 --> 37:30.373
For better or worse, I have experience
with the VA through TC,

37:30.874 --> 37:33.835
Some good and some bad.

37:35.503 --> 37:37.088
And what do you want in return?

37:37.422 --> 37:39.549
I want my family back.

37:40.592 --> 37:43.219
Everyone comes back to work here,
including Topher.

37:43.303 --> 37:44.137
No.

37:44.220 --> 37:46.639
As a doctor, not an ER Chief.

37:49.350 --> 37:52.395
I can live with that if Topher can...

37:54.689 --> 37:55.690
And Paul.

37:57.150 --> 37:58.526
I want him back too.

37:58.610 --> 37:59.652
So do I.

38:01.029 --> 38:02.030
I'll take care of it.

38:08.745 --> 38:11.456
See? We do want the same things.

38:14.250 --> 38:15.668
- You wanna hug it out?
- No.

38:16.419 --> 38:17.837
I thought it was funny.

38:19.964 --> 38:21.090
What's all this about?

38:21.508 --> 38:22.509
An apology.

38:23.510 --> 38:25.053
I'm sorry we didn't believe you.

38:25.220 --> 38:27.138
Yeah. Both of us are.

38:27.222 --> 38:28.681
We had the police bring this in.

38:28.765 --> 38:29.974
I appreciate that.

38:30.809 --> 38:32.268
But I'm afraid the damage is done.

38:32.352 --> 38:33.561
I'm going to miss my audition.

38:33.686 --> 38:36.147
No. You're going to do it from right here.

38:37.774 --> 38:41.653
Maybe not ideal, but it's the only way
we can control the noise.

38:45.657 --> 38:46.783
You all are too much.

38:47.242 --> 38:48.493
I can't thank you enough.

38:49.327 --> 38:50.578
We only have one request.

38:50.787 --> 38:52.831
We'd like to stay for your performance.

38:55.208 --> 38:58.127
I do play better in front of a crowd.

38:59.796 --> 39:01.339
<i>You may begin, sir.</i>

40:05.528 --> 40:06.988
Please help us!

40:07.697 --> 40:08.781
What are we gonna do?

40:10.617 --> 40:11.784
Please!

40:11.993 --> 40:14.829
<i>The doctor's on the way,
girls, stay calm.</i>

40:16.539 --> 40:18.541
<i>It'll be all right.
We'll get you down.</i>

40:19.876 --> 40:21.878
<i>Hang in there, we're readying the bag.</i>

40:24.756 --> 40:25.756
Here.

40:26.674 --> 40:27.508
What are we gonna do?

40:27.592 --> 40:29.260
How are you gonna...

40:29.385 --> 40:30.511
All right, don't move!

40:30.845 --> 40:33.389
I need you to stay calm
while we figure this out!

40:33.514 --> 40:34.514
Okay.

40:36.142 --> 40:38.186
- Oh, my God!
- I'm Dr. Alister. What's your name?

40:38.269 --> 40:39.771
- Sofia!
- And your friend's?

40:39.854 --> 40:42.315
Abby! Just help us!
Please! I wanna get out of here.

40:42.440 --> 40:43.709
It's gonna be okay.
Listen. Okay.

40:43.733 --> 40:46.903
- Oh, my God, I'm gonna die up here! No.
- Sofia, look at me. Look at me.

40:46.986 --> 40:50.073
I promise. We're gonna get down from here,
everything is gonna okay.

40:50.406 --> 40:51.824
You just gotta trust me.

40:52.784 --> 40:53.784
Okay.

40:53.826 --> 40:55.578
It's a go, Drew. We got you.

40:55.662 --> 40:56.996
- Please!
- Copy that.

40:57.163 --> 40:57.997
Please hurry.

40:58.081 --> 40:59.123
Okay, this is the plan.

40:59.207 --> 41:00.625
I'm going release the safety bar.

41:01.209 --> 41:03.209
- Uh-oh.
- Abby, I'm gonna catch you in the basket!

41:03.252 --> 41:05.755
Sofia, you're gonna fall safely
down into the airbag!

41:05.838 --> 41:08.299
I'm not falling down there.
I can't do that.

41:08.383 --> 41:10.027
Yes, you can. You look like a badass.
You can do this.

41:10.051 --> 41:11.719
No. No.

41:11.803 --> 41:12.803
You have to.

41:12.845 --> 41:15.765
I can only get one of you in here.
Abby's intestines are exposed.

41:15.848 --> 41:17.934
- The fall could kill her.
- I can't do this.

41:18.017 --> 41:21.270
We're gonna do this
on the count of three. Okay?

41:21.354 --> 41:22.605
No.

41:23.648 --> 41:25.400
One... Two...

41:25.483 --> 41:27.110
- I'm not doing this.
- Three.

41:29.195 --> 41:31.656
- Help me! I'm gonna fall!
- Sofia, you gotta let go.

41:31.739 --> 41:32.782
I can't.

41:33.366 --> 41:35.702
I can't! Save me!

41:35.785 --> 41:37.912
Please pull me up. Help.

41:37.996 --> 41:40.248
- Sofia, let go, it'll be okay.
- I can't hold on.

41:40.331 --> 41:41.916
Help! Please help me!

41:42.000 --> 41:44.085
You've gotta let go
or we're all gonna die.
