WEBVTT

00:06.709 --> 00:10.041
Okay, Pete Marcos goes to Sandy Bilbo.

00:12.875 --> 00:15.875
Remember, every dollar earned today
at the "It's a Date" auction

00:16.000 --> 00:18.417
goes to buying our
marching band instruments.

00:18.500 --> 00:20.500
Because a marching band
without instruments

00:20.583 --> 00:23.250
is just some kids
stomping around a football field

00:23.333 --> 00:24.792
like a bunch of dopes.

00:26.333 --> 00:29.041
Yo, to win an auction,
you gotta play it smooth.

00:29.125 --> 00:31.208
Let the other bidders make the first move.

00:31.291 --> 00:32.667
Up next is Carol Thompson.

00:32.750 --> 00:34.333
$50!

00:35.333 --> 00:36.542
Ooh, okay.

00:36.625 --> 00:38.208
Uh, who will give me 60?

00:38.291 --> 00:39.583
75!

00:40.208 --> 00:42.750
Smooth, Jerry. Smooth.

00:43.375 --> 00:46.500
Sold to Jerry Martinez for $75.

00:49.208 --> 00:52.208
And that brings us to Kim Crawford.

00:52.250 --> 00:55.792
This black belt beauty is what you saved
your lunch money for, people.

00:58.041 --> 00:59.375
Yeah!

00:59.458 --> 01:01.125
Milton, I don't know if I can do this.

01:01.208 --> 01:02.834
Um, this is kind of embarrassing.

01:02.917 --> 01:04.583
It's not really my thing. I don't--

01:16.583 --> 01:18.667
Okay.

01:18.750 --> 01:20.917
Well, you are a shy little thing,
aren't you?

01:22.291 --> 01:23.709
Do I hear 50?

01:23.750 --> 01:26.875
Yes, you do! You do! You really do!

01:28.500 --> 01:31.667
Albert, President of the Mathletes
with the first bid.

01:31.750 --> 01:32.959
Do I hear 60?

01:33.041 --> 01:35.250
Nicholas, captain of the football team.

01:35.333 --> 01:36.375
Do I hear 70?

01:36.458 --> 01:37.417
70.

01:37.500 --> 01:38.375
80?

01:38.709 --> 01:39.709
90?

01:39.792 --> 01:41.792
Do I hear $100?

01:41.875 --> 01:43.959
- Oh.
- $200!

01:44.041 --> 01:45.333
Wah!

01:47.208 --> 01:50.250
- Going once, going twice...
- Keep going, keep going.

01:50.333 --> 01:54.834
Sold for a record breaking $200 to Albert.

01:56.291 --> 01:58.917
Carol, I've been saving for weeks.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.542
You're the only girl for me.

02:00.625 --> 02:02.041
Up next is Sue Lin.

02:02.125 --> 02:03.959
$100!

I know it's for a good cause, but...

02:52.709 --> 02:54.917
...I can't believe I'm gonna
have to go on a date with Albert.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.375
Here's a little trick.

02:56.458 --> 02:58.875
If you need to end a date
with a nerd early,

02:58.959 --> 03:01.208
lean in, blow in his ear.

03:02.792 --> 03:04.667
He'll faint. You run.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.208
Whoo!

03:07.250 --> 03:09.125
Uh, hey, Kim?

03:09.208 --> 03:12.125
Uh, you're not gonna
have to go on the date with Albert.

03:12.208 --> 03:14.250
Yeah, I am. He had the highest bid.

03:14.500 --> 03:19.000
Well, he did the bidding,
but it wasn't for himself.

03:19.583 --> 03:20.667
It was for me.

03:21.959 --> 03:24.166
- What? Really, why?
-

03:24.500 --> 03:26.250
I don't know, I guess...

03:26.333 --> 03:28.709
The thought of you
going out with some other guy...

03:28.834 --> 03:30.875
To be honest, it kind of bothered me.

03:31.542 --> 03:33.166
What are you saying, Jack?

03:33.500 --> 03:35.000
I'm saying that

03:35.583 --> 03:37.375
maybe we should go on a...

03:38.083 --> 03:39.959
An outing?

03:40.041 --> 03:41.375
We could definitely do an outing.

03:41.458 --> 03:43.083
- An outing.
- An outing. Yeah.

03:43.542 --> 03:45.000
So, uh,

03:45.083 --> 03:46.834
why didn't you just bid on me yourself?

03:46.917 --> 03:48.542
I don't know. I guess...

03:48.625 --> 03:50.500
I thought it would weird our friends out.

03:51.208 --> 03:52.250
Yeah, you're right.

03:52.333 --> 03:55.458
The minute they find out
we're going on an actual date,

03:55.542 --> 03:57.083
they'll treat us differently.

03:57.166 --> 03:58.542
So we'll keep it to ourselves?

03:58.625 --> 03:59.917
Absolutely.

04:00.375 --> 04:01.417
<i>Kim!</i>

04:01.500 --> 04:04.125
Kim! Kim!

04:05.959 --> 04:07.583
Albert, what are you doing here?

04:07.667 --> 04:09.625
Kim, I'm glad I caught you.

04:10.125 --> 04:12.208
Give me a second. Whoo!

04:12.291 --> 04:14.125
Oh, I just ran all the way from Phil's.

04:15.417 --> 04:17.333
Jack, forget our agreement.

04:17.417 --> 04:20.417
I realize that I, too,
have feelings for Kim

04:20.500 --> 04:22.208
and I'm gonna take her on a date.

04:22.792 --> 04:24.083
Uh, Albert, I don't--

04:24.166 --> 04:25.375
Jack, I got this.

04:25.458 --> 04:28.542
Our date will begin with a romantic
carriage ride through the park,

04:28.625 --> 04:30.375
where, you know, we'll hold hands and--

04:30.458 --> 04:32.417
-
- Nerd down.

04:41.333 --> 04:42.667
So, Sam,

04:42.750 --> 04:45.000
did you decide what you're gonna do
for the school talent show?

04:45.083 --> 04:46.375
Yep. Piano.

04:46.458 --> 04:48.917
It's pronounced "karate."

04:50.083 --> 04:51.208
It's a good choice.

04:52.083 --> 04:54.583
But they have this
great piano there, Rudy.

04:54.667 --> 04:56.750
I could program like
ten different instruments on it.

04:56.834 --> 04:57.959
I think I can win.

04:58.041 --> 05:00.458
Please. Nobody likes music.

05:01.458 --> 05:03.250
Karate's how you win a talent show.

05:03.333 --> 05:04.375
And I would have won mine

05:04.458 --> 05:06.750
if I didn't get a raging case
of donkey pox.

05:06.834 --> 05:07.959
Donkey pox?

05:08.041 --> 05:10.959
Yeah, it's like chicken pox but phlegmier.

05:13.709 --> 05:15.750
<i>I had to be in the bubble
because I was contagious.</i>

05:15.834 --> 05:19.041
<i>but everything was going fine
until my regulator malfunctioned.</i>

05:29.375 --> 05:31.625
<i>Of course, the sneeze didn't help.</i>

05:38.583 --> 05:40.125
Now, I lost,

05:40.208 --> 05:42.083
but the great thing about raising kids

05:42.166 --> 05:44.625
is you can force them
to achieve the goals you could not.

05:45.792 --> 05:47.458
That's just good parenting.

05:58.750 --> 05:59.875
Hey, Kim.

06:00.208 --> 06:02.208
I got us a reservation at Portaccini's.

06:02.291 --> 06:03.208
That's impossible.

06:03.291 --> 06:06.166
Tomorrow night, 7:30,
table by the fountain.

06:06.250 --> 06:07.625
This is gonna be perfect.

06:07.709 --> 06:09.500
I even made you a little something.

06:09.583 --> 06:11.625
But remember we're not saying a word
about this to anyone.

06:11.709 --> 06:12.667
Right.

06:13.709 --> 06:15.542
- Okay.
- Okay.

06:18.709 --> 06:20.375
Uh-huh.

06:20.375 --> 06:21.458
Really?

06:22.166 --> 06:23.667
You don't say.

06:32.709 --> 06:36.250
That was Carol Thompson. Clingy.

06:36.375 --> 06:38.417
Kim, I can't stand clingy girls.

06:38.500 --> 06:40.667
I'm sorry things with Carol
didn't work out,

06:40.750 --> 06:43.375
but I'm sure the right person
is even closer than you think.

06:48.125 --> 06:50.667
Uh, Kim, you dropped this.

06:55.291 --> 06:56.542
"J" plus "K"?

06:59.250 --> 07:00.750
No way.

07:00.834 --> 07:02.250
Wait, is this you and Jack?

07:02.667 --> 07:03.709
You guys are together?

07:03.792 --> 07:05.792
No. No, no, no. It's not, it's not Jack.

07:05.875 --> 07:08.750
It's a different "J" person.

07:14.500 --> 07:15.625
Wait a minute.

07:17.083 --> 07:18.583
Jerry's a "J" person.

07:20.875 --> 07:22.709
Is this "J" me?

07:23.750 --> 07:27.250
Uh...

07:28.500 --> 07:29.500
yes.

07:30.959 --> 07:32.166
Yes, it is.

07:32.250 --> 07:33.417
Ah!

07:33.875 --> 07:35.542
It makes so much sense now.

07:35.625 --> 07:38.000
The right person is closer than you think.

07:38.083 --> 07:40.083
Tomorrow night,
we're going on our first date.

07:40.375 --> 07:43.542
- Uh, you know, Jerry, I--
- Shh, shh, shh.

07:44.041 --> 07:47.250
You're gonna see the soft, sensitive side
of Jerry Martinez.

07:47.333 --> 07:48.417
Just hang on.

07:48.959 --> 07:51.583
-
- It's over, Carol. You're out!

07:53.750 --> 07:57.041
<i>♪ It's not as cool
As kickin' it with you ♪</i>

07:57.125 --> 07:59.875
Okay, lesson one, defense.

07:59.959 --> 08:02.625
Now I'm gonna swing this focus pad at you
and you're gonna duck under it.

08:02.709 --> 08:03.709
Ready?

08:07.625 --> 08:08.583
You have to duck.

08:08.667 --> 08:09.709
- Oh, all right.
- Okay?

08:09.792 --> 08:11.000
Let's try it again.

08:15.250 --> 08:16.542
You know, I think I see the problem.

08:16.625 --> 08:18.000
I'm not very good at karate?

08:18.083 --> 08:20.125
That, and you have the reflexes of a wall.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.583
But that's okay. Let me show you.

08:22.875 --> 08:25.750
I'm gonna say "ready,"
you swing, I'll duck.

08:25.834 --> 08:27.834
Now, you're not gonna be able to hit me

08:27.917 --> 08:29.750
because I'm a sensei
and I have what some people call

08:29.834 --> 08:31.375
super ninja reflex-- Ow!

08:36.667 --> 08:37.750
That's perfect.

08:37.834 --> 08:40.583
You know, I've never actually
bought a corsage before.

08:40.667 --> 08:43.333
I'm pretty excited.
It's for my new girlfr...

08:43.417 --> 08:44.458
person.

08:47.375 --> 08:49.125
Hey, Jack. What you got in the box?

08:50.834 --> 08:53.375
Uh, it's my, uh...

08:56.375 --> 08:57.458
bird.

08:57.875 --> 08:58.959
Bucky.

09:00.917 --> 09:02.834
Why is your bird in a box?

09:02.917 --> 09:07.917
Well, my bird is in a box because it's...

09:09.375 --> 09:10.500
dead.

09:10.583 --> 09:12.625
Uh, I mean, uh, dead.

09:13.792 --> 09:16.125
I am so sorry.

09:16.208 --> 09:17.500
Come on. Bring it in, you.

09:17.583 --> 09:18.959
- No, thanks.
- Eh.

09:24.375 --> 09:26.125
Okay, uh, you know...

09:26.208 --> 09:27.750
Thank you, Milton, but I'm grieving,

09:27.834 --> 09:29.959
so I should probably be alone right now.

09:30.041 --> 09:31.375
Oh, you're wrong, Jack.

09:31.458 --> 09:33.667
A funeral service
is exactly what you need.

09:33.750 --> 09:36.250
That's why I'm arranging one here
at the dojo tomorrow.

09:37.041 --> 09:38.917
Ah, I don't know, man.

09:39.709 --> 09:42.375
Bucky was a very private bird.

09:42.458 --> 09:43.875
Trust me, Jack.

09:44.750 --> 09:47.375
I didn't get to say
a proper goodbye to my goldfish.

09:47.500 --> 09:50.750
There are some days
I just can't even get out of bed.

09:50.834 --> 09:52.542
I'm sorry, man. When did that happen?

09:53.166 --> 09:54.917
Nine years ago.

09:59.041 --> 10:01.709
Wow! Kim, you look amazing.

10:01.792 --> 10:04.333
Thanks. You do, too.

10:04.417 --> 10:06.917
Uh, this was supposed to be
our romantic date at Portaccini's.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.500
Yeah, instead I'm going to a funeral
for a bird that doesn't exist.

10:10.583 --> 10:14.291
I'm going on a date with Jerry
who unfortunately does exist.

10:15.417 --> 10:17.375
Let's get our grieve on, Jack.

10:17.458 --> 10:18.834
Kim, you're not gonna believe this.

10:18.917 --> 10:20.917
I got us a table at Portaccini's.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.667
Some poor dude had to cancel.

10:35.417 --> 10:37.875
You know, I can't say I'm surprised
you wanted to date me, Kim.

10:39.959 --> 10:42.917
See, the thing about me
is I'm all cool on the outside,

10:43.000 --> 10:46.500
but on the inside I'm <i>en fuego.</i>

10:47.583 --> 10:50.250
You know, I think that's why
I suffer from extreme fevers.

10:50.333 --> 10:51.709
You know, my doctor actually--

10:51.792 --> 10:53.542
<i>Oh, I can't stand clingy girls.</i>

10:53.625 --> 10:55.834
<i>Clingy girls, clingy girls,
clingy girls...</i>

10:55.917 --> 10:58.542
- He said it was a mixture of like--
- Yeah, yeah. That's great. Whatever.

10:58.625 --> 10:59.500
Listen...

11:00.083 --> 11:04.125
now that we're dating,
there's gonna be some changes.

11:04.208 --> 11:05.667
- Changes?
- Yeah.

11:05.750 --> 11:08.583
This Saturday, instead of going to
your cousin Chewy's birthday,

11:08.667 --> 11:10.667
we're gonna go shopping for skirts.

11:11.834 --> 11:13.083
But I don't wear skirts.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.417
And on Sunday,
we're gonna go to the craft store.

11:16.667 --> 11:19.667
They have an all day
candle making class for couples.

11:19.750 --> 11:22.875
That is so not <i>en fuego.</i>

11:22.959 --> 11:24.834
I have to go to the bathroom.

11:24.917 --> 11:26.667
I'm gonna miss you so much.

11:38.083 --> 11:39.125
Hello?

11:39.208 --> 11:41.208
<i>Hey, sweetie. It's me.</i>

11:42.333 --> 11:44.333
Kim, are you calling me from the bathroom?

11:44.417 --> 11:46.750

and the night ends here, at our place.

14:23.875 --> 14:25.834

we'd go to the lake

14:48.208 --> 14:50.458
every girl in the school
is interested in me.

14:50.542 --> 14:53.333
But I'm so overbearing and clingy.

14:53.417 --> 14:54.792

15:00.750 --> 15:02.166
But I don't care about all that.

15:02.583 --> 15:04.375
What I care about is I'm rejecting girls

15:04.458 --> 15:06.709

since I started school.

15:07.250 --> 15:09.959

15:23.959 --> 15:26.625
the girl that was too good
to talk to me in kindergarten.

15:26.709 --> 15:28.917
Should've put a ring on it, Heather!

15:30.959 --> 15:32.417
This could have been you.

15:42.125 --> 15:43.125
There you are.

15:44.500 --> 15:46.625

up Mount Seaford?

15:46.709 --> 15:47.667
Oh, yeah.

15:47.750 --> 15:49.875
The important thing is that it's all over.

15:49.959 --> 15:51.083
Not quite.

15:51.166 --> 15:53.375

and most importantly,
