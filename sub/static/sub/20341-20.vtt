Wow! Oh.

01:05.833 --> 01:09.000
It's gonna be
a white Christmas tomorrow.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.250
I know you're excited
about Christmas.

01:11.250 --> 01:13.875
But I can't wait to give you
your special presents.

01:13.875 --> 01:15.000
ARF?

01:17.708 --> 01:19.708
ARF upgraded your collars

01:19.708 --> 01:21.708
for extra Christmas spirit.

Ho, ho, ho!

01:25.458 --> 01:26.625
Thanks, ARF.

01:26.625 --> 01:28.208
Yeah, we love it.

01:28.208 --> 01:30.166
And this is for you, Olivia.

01:34.250 --> 01:37.250
Bob:
And I made this
especially for you, Hissy.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.708
(meow)

01:42.708 --> 01:45.833
Can't wait to see what presents
Santa brings you in the morning.

01:45.833 --> 01:47.875
Merry Christmas to all

01:47.875 --> 01:50.875
and to my pets,
a good night.

01:50.875 --> 01:52.375
(snoring)

01:52.375 --> 01:55.583
I hope Santa brings Bob
an extra special present

01:55.583 --> 01:58.250
since he's been
such a good Bob all year.

01:58.250 --> 02:01.250
Bingo:
I'm sure he will.
Good night, everyone.

02:01.250 --> 02:02.250
Hissy:
Good night, guys.

02:02.250 --> 02:03.875

(yawns) Good night.

02:05.416 --> 02:08.250
-(rustling, crash)
-Man: Ooh!

02:08.250 --> 02:11.000
Rolly, do you
hear that noise?

02:11.000 --> 02:12.708
-Man: Oh!
-(clattering)

02:12.708 --> 02:14.625
It sounds like a jolly old man

02:14.625 --> 02:16.166
digging through a magical bag.

02:16.166 --> 02:17.875
Ho, ho, ho!

02:17.875 --> 02:19.250
No!

02:19.250 --> 02:20.458
Santa?

02:20.458 --> 02:24.000
Oh. Hello there,
Bingo and Rolly.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.458
It's really him!

02:25.458 --> 02:27.333
Yeah, it's really you!

02:27.333 --> 02:28.708
Oh, reindeer!

02:28.708 --> 02:31.708
I can't find
Bob's Christmas present
in my bag.

02:31.708 --> 02:35.375
I think it fell out
in that bumpy snowstorm outside.

02:35.375 --> 02:37.458
Bob's present is lost?

02:37.458 --> 02:38.750
Yes!

02:38.750 --> 02:42.166
And each present is just
as special as the person
who receives it.

02:42.166 --> 02:44.291
Which is why
I have to find it.

02:44.291 --> 02:46.333
Finding things for Bob
is kind of our thing.

02:46.333 --> 02:47.458
Our mission could be

02:47.458 --> 02:49.333
to help you bring back
Bob's lost present.

02:49.333 --> 02:53.333
No wonder you're both
regulars on my Nice List.

02:53.333 --> 02:58.250
I'll pack these in case we need
a finding-Bob's-lost-present
snack for later.

02:58.250 --> 02:59.500
Good idea, Rolly.

02:59.500 --> 03:02.083
Santa, lead the way
to your sleigh.

03:02.083 --> 03:04.000
Deck the halls!

03:04.000 --> 03:06.333
It's gonna be hard
to find Bob's present

03:06.333 --> 03:08.166
in this storm!

03:08.166 --> 03:11.250
Maybe it would help
if we knew where
to start looking.

03:11.250 --> 03:15.000
Well, on my way to your house,
I remember flying over...

03:15.000 --> 03:16.125
the lake!

03:16.125 --> 03:18.125
Then the lake's the place
to start.

03:18.125 --> 03:20.416
Buckle up, pups.

03:20.416 --> 03:23.958
Because ho, ho, ho,
and away we go!

03:25.250 --> 03:28.000
("Jingle Bells" playing)

03:33.291 --> 03:35.875
Okay, Bob's present

03:35.875 --> 03:37.125
is wrapped in red paper,

03:37.125 --> 03:38.708
has a green bow
on top,

03:38.708 --> 03:41.375
and smells
like candy canes.

03:41.375 --> 03:42.583
Mm!

03:42.583 --> 03:43.875
If it's out here,

03:43.875 --> 03:45.458
my puppy nose
will find it.

03:45.458 --> 03:46.875
(sniffing)

03:46.875 --> 03:48.500
(sniffs) Mm.

03:48.500 --> 03:50.250
See anything, pups?

03:50.250 --> 03:51.708
Nope.

03:51.708 --> 03:53.708
Nada. Nothing.

03:54.708 --> 03:56.750
Daisy:
Bingo? Rolly?

03:56.750 --> 03:58.625
Is that Santa?

03:58.625 --> 04:01.875
Well hello,
Daisy, Dash, and Duke!

04:01.875 --> 04:04.125
Merry Christmas!

04:04.125 --> 04:06.583
Hey, those are
some sad puppy eyes.

04:06.583 --> 04:08.125
(whimpering)

04:08.125 --> 04:11.875
I gave the pups
their favorite doggie treats
as a Christmas Eve present,

04:11.875 --> 04:15.416
but they decided to play
with them and they accidentally
fell into the water.

04:15.416 --> 04:18.291
Hey, Rolly. You thinking
what I'm thinking?

04:18.291 --> 04:19.125
I think so.

04:23.291 --> 04:26.000
We'd love to share
our Christmas treats
with you tonight.

04:27.083 --> 04:28.291
Thank you!

04:28.291 --> 04:30.083
Merry Christmas to all

04:30.083 --> 04:32.250
and to all a good bite!

04:34.000 --> 04:37.708
Well, if Bob's gift isn't
at the lake, maybe it fell
somewhere else.

04:37.708 --> 04:39.625
Do you remember
where you flew over next?

04:39.625 --> 04:40.875
We remember!

04:40.875 --> 04:43.000
We saw you go that way!

04:43.000 --> 04:44.583
That's toward
the junkyard!

04:44.583 --> 04:47.208
Well then,
to the junkyard!

04:48.625 --> 04:50.708
Daisy, Dash, and Duke:
Merry Christmas!

04:50.708 --> 04:53.291
Rolly:
Bye! Thanks for all your help!

04:54.958 --> 04:56.875
I haven't seen
Bob's present.

04:56.875 --> 04:59.708
But I did see a red thing
with a green bow

04:59.708 --> 05:02.458
falling from the sky
by the dog park.

05:02.458 --> 05:04.333
Red with a green bow?

05:04.333 --> 05:07.208
That could be Bob's present.
Let's go!

05:08.208 --> 05:10.166
May I ask why
the Christmas lights

05:10.166 --> 05:12.375
on your doghouse
aren't on, Bulworth?

05:12.375 --> 05:16.583
I put 'em up to bring
some Christmas spirit
to the junkyard.

05:16.583 --> 05:18.166
But they're broken.

05:20.333 --> 05:24.083
If you need some
Christmas spirit,
we've got you covered.

05:24.083 --> 05:26.875
-("Jingle Bells" plays)
-Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

05:26.875 --> 05:28.166
Dig that Christmas spirit.

05:28.166 --> 05:30.083
(chuckles) Thanks, Rolly.

05:30.083 --> 05:31.375
I appreciate the thought,

05:31.375 --> 05:34.208
but I was looking forward
to seeing this place
really lit up

05:34.208 --> 05:35.250
with Christmas spirit.

05:35.250 --> 05:37.083
Bulworth, Christmas spirit

05:37.083 --> 05:39.458

just colorful lights,

Well, I can think of something

07:23.416 --> 07:26.333
Between the music,
the lights, and my friends,

07:26.333 --> 07:29.000
I'm really feeling
the Christmas spirit.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.708
And also,
'cause Santa's here.

07:31.708 --> 07:33.250
That's pretty awesome.

07:33.250 --> 07:34.000
(wind gusts)

Jumping gingerbread men!

07:35.833 --> 07:37.708
The storm is picking up again.

07:37.708 --> 07:39.833
But we've still got
Bob's present to find.

07:39.833 --> 07:41.000
Come on!

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Good luck, pups.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.375
Bulworth:
Merry Christmas!

07:45.291 --> 07:48.625
With all this snow,
I can barely see!

07:48.625 --> 07:50.458
The dog park should be right--

07:54.583 --> 07:56.125
-Santa: Ooh!
-(Bingo and Rolly grunt)

07:56.125 --> 07:58.125
(all groaning)

08:01.500 --> 08:05.166
Sad sugarplums!
This sleigh is stuck in the snow

08:05.166 --> 08:07.375
and we still need
to find Bob's present.

08:08.333 --> 08:09.416
We'll look for it.

08:09.416 --> 08:10.500
Great!

08:10.500 --> 08:12.166
And I'll work on the sleigh.

08:12.166 --> 08:13.500
Go Team Christmas!

08:14.875 --> 08:18.500
According to Bulworth,
it should have landed
somewhere around...

08:18.500 --> 08:19.625
There!

08:25.375 --> 08:28.458
Red wrapping paper,
a green bow.

08:28.458 --> 08:31.208
(sniffs) And smells
like candy canes.

08:31.208 --> 08:32.416
Mmm!

08:32.416 --> 08:34.083
It's Bob's present!

08:34.083 --> 08:35.416
Let's get it back
so Santa can--

08:35.416 --> 08:38.458
What are you puppies
doing with that present?

08:38.458 --> 08:40.958
Merry Christmas,
Cupcake and Rufus!

08:40.958 --> 08:42.750
You must be confused

08:42.750 --> 08:44.833
because I was playing out here

08:44.833 --> 08:48.000
when I saw that present
fall out of the sky for me.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.166
(barks indistinctly)

08:49.166 --> 08:51.583
We don't have time to argue.
Come on, Rolly.

08:51.583 --> 08:53.500
Hey, my present!

08:53.500 --> 08:55.083
Rufus, get it!

08:55.083 --> 08:56.291
(barking)

08:57.291 --> 08:58.583
(grunting)

08:58.583 --> 08:59.625
Bingo and Rolly:
(both panting)

08:59.625 --> 09:01.083
-Santa!
-We found it!

09:01.083 --> 09:02.458
We found Bob's present!

09:02.458 --> 09:04.166
But Cupcake thinks it's hers.

09:04.166 --> 09:05.458
Cupcake:
That's 'cause it is!

09:05.458 --> 09:07.375
(grunting)

09:07.375 --> 09:08.750
Santa?

09:08.750 --> 09:10.000
(barking): Santa?

09:10.000 --> 09:11.125
Hello, Cupcake.

09:11.125 --> 09:12.875
Hello, Rufus.

09:12.875 --> 09:14.291
What's wrong?

09:14.291 --> 09:16.583
Well, you see, Mr. Santa,

09:16.583 --> 09:18.750
I know I'm not
always a good dog,

09:18.750 --> 09:21.125
so I wasn't expecting
any presents this year

09:21.125 --> 09:22.833
but when this one
showed up, I thought...

09:22.833 --> 09:25.708
maybe you didn't
forget me after all.

09:25.708 --> 09:28.166
Forget you?
Oh, Cupcake!

09:28.166 --> 09:30.833
You may not have been
the nicest dog all year

09:30.833 --> 09:33.291
but I know who you are
deep down.

09:33.291 --> 09:35.166
And you, my sweet Cupcake,

09:35.166 --> 09:38.166
are a good dog.

09:38.166 --> 09:41.208
The gift you found
in the park isn't yours.

09:41.208 --> 09:43.500
Well, I guess
I kind of figured.

09:43.500 --> 09:44.958
But these are!

09:44.958 --> 09:46.708
What?

09:48.250 --> 09:50.250
Thank you,
Santa!

09:50.250 --> 09:52.291
Mmm! Mm-hmm!

09:52.291 --> 09:55.458
Now, if we can't
get my sleigh free,

09:55.458 --> 09:58.166
no one else will get
their presents this year.

09:58.166 --> 09:59.250
I think we can help!

09:59.250 --> 10:01.958
Let's show him
how it's done, Rufus.

10:01.958 --> 10:03.083
(barks in agreement)

10:03.083 --> 10:04.375
-Yeah!
-Yay!

10:04.375 --> 10:06.375
(all panting)

10:06.375 --> 10:08.625
Ho, ho, ho yeah!

10:08.625 --> 10:11.375
Thank you, Cupcake.
And thank you, Rufus.

10:11.375 --> 10:12.708
Don't mention it.

10:12.708 --> 10:15.250
I mean, it is
Christmas or whatever.

10:15.250 --> 10:17.375
Time to hit the sky, pups.

10:17.375 --> 10:19.208
Ho, ho, ho!

10:19.208 --> 10:21.708
To Bob's house we go!

10:21.708 --> 10:25.166
Bye, Santa!
Merry Christmas, everyone!

10:25.166 --> 10:27.708
Merry Christmas, Rufus.

10:27.708 --> 10:29.000
(growls affectionately)

10:30.208 --> 10:32.750
Bob's present
is finally under the tree

10:32.750 --> 10:34.208
where it belongs.

10:34.208 --> 10:36.333
I couldn't have done it
without your help.

10:36.333 --> 10:38.083
Anytime, Santa.

10:38.083 --> 10:40.291
I can't believe
I just said that.

10:40.291 --> 10:41.458
(barking)

10:41.458 --> 10:43.458
Ho, ho! Oh, puppy kisses!

10:43.458 --> 10:44.958
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

10:44.958 --> 10:46.458
Merry Christmas, Bingo.

10:46.458 --> 10:48.166
Merry Christmas, Rolly.

10:49.583 --> 10:52.000
Merry Christmas, Santa.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.875
Well, that was some
Christmas Eve.

10:54.875 --> 10:57.375
I'm as exhausted
as an exhausted puppy.

10:57.375 --> 10:59.000
Me too.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.083
Maybe it's my sleepy puppy eyes

11:01.083 --> 11:04.000
but I think Santa forgot
to leave our Christmas presents.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
At least
the most important one is there.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
Besides, Christmas spirit
is about more than
lights or presents.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.208
It's about being
with those you love.

11:13.208 --> 11:15.166
Bingo:
Merry Christmas, brother.

11:15.166 --> 11:16.500
Rolly:
Merry Christmas, brother.

11:16.500 --> 11:18.583
Santa:
Ho, ho, ho yeah!

11:20.208 --> 11:22.750
Bob:
It's Christmas! Haha!

11:24.083 --> 11:27.250
Bingo, look! Santa didn't
forget us after all.

11:27.250 --> 11:29.708
He must have come back
when we were asleep.

11:29.708 --> 11:31.166
(giggles) Sneaky Santa.

11:32.625 --> 11:35.125
Santa brought us
all these dog treats.

11:35.125 --> 11:37.000
Bow to the wow!

11:37.000 --> 11:38.875
And he brought us
our own Santa hats!

11:38.875 --> 11:40.166
Ho, ho, ho!

11:40.166 --> 11:41.458
Bob:
A present for me!

11:41.458 --> 11:43.833
(gasps)
This is exactly
what I wanted!

11:43.833 --> 11:44.875
(sniffs)

11:44.875 --> 11:47.583
And it smells like
candy canes. Mm!

11:51.083 --> 11:52.875
What's this?

11:52.875 --> 11:54.416
Dear Bingo and Rolly,

11:54.416 --> 11:57.875
Thank you for showing me
that Christmas spirit
is always alive.

11:57.875 --> 11:59.875
Your friend,
Santa.

11:59.875 --> 12:02.125
Wait, you guys
know Santa?

12:02.125 --> 12:03.291
We go way back.

12:03.291 --> 12:05.208
Hey, guys,
let's take a picture

12:05.208 --> 12:06.833
of us with
our Christmas presents.

12:06.833 --> 12:10.333
Everyone say,
"Merry Christmas!"

12:10.333 --> 12:12.708
All:
Merry Christmas!

12:16.708 --> 12:18.500
(Bingo and Rolly speaking)

12:20.375 --> 12:21.583
Looks like you've got

12:21.583 --> 12:23.083
your hands full, neighbors.

12:23.083 --> 12:24.250
You want some help?

12:24.250 --> 12:25.833
Thanks, Bob.
We'll see you tonight

12:25.833 --> 12:27.000
at our Hanukkah party, right?

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Oh, wouldn't miss it.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.125
What can I bring this year?

12:30.125 --> 12:31.875
If you want,
you can bring latkes,

12:31.875 --> 12:34.000
those potato pancakes
we have every year.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.958
They're a special Hanukkah food.

12:35.958 --> 12:37.250
Will do!

12:37.250 --> 12:40.375
And puppies.
Bring latkes and puppies.

12:40.375 --> 12:42.416
Yeah, bring us.

12:42.416 --> 12:45.083
Oh! We light
the Hanukkah candles
after sunset,

12:45.083 --> 12:47.458
when it gets dark enough
to see the first stars
of the night,

12:47.458 --> 12:49.833
so make sure to be here
before it gets dark.

12:49.833 --> 12:51.958
Okey-dokey.
See you tonight.

12:52.958 --> 12:54.583
Bob:
And potatoes, check.

12:54.583 --> 12:57.250
Eggs, check.

12:57.250 --> 12:58.750
It looks like
I've got everything.

12:59.750 --> 13:01.333
(gasps) Except oil.

13:01.333 --> 13:02.875
(beeping)

13:02.875 --> 13:03.958
Great gears!

13:03.958 --> 13:05.208
I've got to go to work.

13:05.208 --> 13:07.208
I'll buy more oil
on the way home.

13:08.208 --> 13:10.291
See you pups tonight.

13:10.291 --> 13:13.458
I hope I'll have enough time
to make the latkes
before the party.

13:15.083 --> 13:16.291
Rolly:
Uh-oh.

13:16.291 --> 13:18.875
Bob accidentally left
the eggs out of the fridge.

13:18.875 --> 13:21.166
Let's put them back.

13:21.166 --> 13:23.000
Hey, ARF, can you-- Oops.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.083
Uh-oh! (grunts)

13:24.083 --> 13:26.375
Okay. (grunts)

13:26.375 --> 13:27.458
Bingo:
Oh, no!

13:28.458 --> 13:29.500
Whoa! (grunts)

13:29.500 --> 13:31.125
Whoa! (groans) Huh?

13:31.125 --> 13:32.875
Come back here, egg!

13:32.875 --> 13:33.875
Whoa!

13:35.250 --> 13:36.583
No!

13:39.458 --> 13:41.208
ARF:
Uh-oh.

13:41.208 --> 13:43.583
The garbage compactor
mashed the potatoes.

13:44.625 --> 13:48.166
This is my fault,
and now Bob can't make latkes!

13:48.166 --> 13:51.166
Aw. Bingo was just
trying to help.

13:51.166 --> 13:52.875
Yeah, but I made things worse.

13:52.875 --> 13:55.166
And now Bob's going to be upset.

13:55.166 --> 13:58.250
And Chloe's family won't have
that special Hanukkah food!

13:58.250 --> 14:00.291
Bob just needs more ingredients.

14:00.291 --> 14:02.500
Then he could make
the latkes. Right?

14:02.500 --> 14:03.583
That's true!

14:03.583 --> 14:04.750
And if anybody can chase down

14:04.750 --> 14:07.208
rolly things like eggs
and potatoes, it's us!

14:07.208 --> 14:10.000
We can find new ingredients
before Bob gets home!

14:10.000 --> 14:11.125
It'll be our mission!

14:11.125 --> 14:12.125
A Hanukkah mission.

14:12.125 --> 14:13.416
Mazel tov!

14:13.416 --> 14:15.000
Come on!

14:15.000 --> 14:16.125

with the potatoes.

14:58.250 --> 14:59.500
Where can we find some?

14:59.500 --> 15:00.875
In the ground?

15:00.875 --> 15:02.083
You mean we get to dig?

15:02.083 --> 15:03.625
You don't have to
tell me twice.

15:04.625 --> 15:06.458
Not just anywhere, Rolly.

15:06.458 --> 15:09.458
I bet the farm
will have potatoes.

15:09.458 --> 15:11.458
And eggs, too.

15:11.458 --> 15:13.833
Time to take this mission
on the road.

15:14.833 --> 15:16.250
ARF:
Let's go!

15:18.500 --> 15:20.750
Uh-oh, small problem.

15:20.750 --> 15:23.166
ARF does not remember
how to get to the farm.

15:23.166 --> 15:25.375
Cagey knows this town
like the back of his paw.

15:25.375 --> 15:27.000
He'll know where
to find the farm!

15:27.000 --> 15:29.875
We need to be home
with the ingredients
before Bob gets there.

15:29.875 --> 15:32.125
So hit it, ARF!
We gotta go fast.

15:34.708 --> 15:36.083
Rolly:
There's Cagey!

15:36.083 --> 15:38.166
-(crash)
-(Bingo and Rolly groan)

15:38.166 --> 15:41.250
We went fast
and we stopped fast. Whew!

15:41.250 --> 15:43.875
Hey, Cagey.
We're looking for the farm.

15:43.875 --> 15:45.125
Do you know
the fastest way there?

15:45.125 --> 15:47.166
Sure!
Down that road aways,

15:47.166 --> 15:49.166
then turn at the big oak tree.

15:49.166 --> 15:50.500
But I'm glad you're here,

15:50.500 --> 15:52.583
I was hoping
to see you before I left.

15:52.583 --> 15:53.875
You're leaving?

15:53.875 --> 15:56.958
I'm finally going to live
with a family!

15:56.958 --> 15:58.000
Congrats, Cagey.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.708
We're gonna miss you, buddy.

15:59.708 --> 16:01.250
But I'm glad
you found a family.

16:01.250 --> 16:04.166
Oh, yes.
Families are the best.

16:04.166 --> 16:06.166
I'll miss you guys, too.

16:06.166 --> 16:08.875
But who knows?
Maybe I'll see you around.

16:08.875 --> 16:10.208
Good luck on the farm.

16:10.208 --> 16:11.291
Thanks, Cagey.

but Bob needs to be
at the party before dark.

17:04.708 --> 17:06.583
Which means
we don't have much time.

17:06.583 --> 17:09.333
Then let's double
our puppy power and split up.

17:09.333 --> 17:11.625
You get the potatoes
and I'll get the eggs.

17:11.625 --> 17:13.208
Meet you back here
at ARF.

17:13.208 --> 17:15.000
ARF is the meeting place.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.250
ARF is helping
the Hanukkah mission.

17:17.250 --> 17:19.083
-(chickens squawking)
-The chicken coop!

17:19.083 --> 17:20.625
There should be eggs in here.

17:20.625 --> 17:22.166
Hi! I need eggs.

17:22.166 --> 17:24.625
(all squawking)

17:24.625 --> 17:27.708
Wait, please, j-just listen.
I need your help.

17:27.708 --> 17:28.958
All:
(squawk)

17:32.708 --> 17:35.125
Er, what kind of help?

17:35.125 --> 17:39.250
I need some eggs so Bob
can make latkes for
a Hanukkah party.

17:39.250 --> 17:41.625
-(all squawking)
-That sounds important.

17:41.625 --> 17:44.875
We only give eggs to true--
(squawk) friends of chickens.

17:44.875 --> 17:47.166
I am a true friend! Really!

17:47.166 --> 17:50.250
I'll-- bawk, bawk, bawk--
believe it if you can answer

17:50.250 --> 17:51.750
our ancient chicken riddle.
(squawks)

17:51.750 --> 17:53.208
It's very difficult.

17:53.208 --> 17:54.333
Bring it on.

17:54.333 --> 17:57.708
Bawk. Why did the chicken
cross the road?

18:03.625 --> 18:06.083
To get to
the other side, of course.

18:06.083 --> 18:09.166
-Wow!
-He's practically a chicken.

18:09.166 --> 18:11.583
You are a wise
and worthy puppy.

18:11.583 --> 18:14.500
And a true friend
of chickens. Bawk.

18:14.500 --> 18:16.208
We'll give you some eggs.

18:17.250 --> 18:18.708
(sniffing)

18:18.708 --> 18:21.125
Come on, nose,
find those potatoes-- Whoa!

18:21.125 --> 18:22.250
Whoa! Oof!

18:22.250 --> 18:25.083
Moo! Look at that potato.

18:26.083 --> 18:27.708
Potato! Where?

18:27.708 --> 18:30.416
Ahh! A talking potato?

18:30.416 --> 18:32.000
(laughs)

18:32.000 --> 18:34.583
Me? I'm not a potato.
I'm a Rolly.

18:34.583 --> 18:36.416
You sure are rolly.

18:36.416 --> 18:40.708
And you're little
and brown and lumpy just like
those extra potatoes there.

18:40.708 --> 18:45.000
(angelic choir music plays)

18:46.000 --> 18:47.083
Got 'em!

18:47.083 --> 18:49.458
We need to get these
to Bob soon!

18:49.458 --> 18:52.125
ARF, how fast
can you get us home?

18:52.125 --> 18:54.250
ARF feels the need...

18:54.250 --> 18:56.625
the need for going faster.

18:57.833 --> 18:59.500
Bingo and Rolly:
Whoa!

19:02.875 --> 19:04.833
This is fast!

19:04.833 --> 19:06.875
Yeah, but it's getting later.

19:06.875 --> 19:09.000
Can you go
even faster, ARF?

19:09.000 --> 19:10.958
ARF will try, Bingo.

19:12.583 --> 19:13.708
The potatoes!

19:13.708 --> 19:15.625
It's raining potatoes!

19:17.750 --> 19:19.250
-Yuck!
-No!

19:20.250 --> 19:21.625
Bingo and Rolly: No!

19:23.166 --> 19:25.208
(laughing)

19:25.208 --> 19:26.083
What?

19:29.083 --> 19:32.958
Look, Bumble!
Bouncy balls! Get 'em!

19:32.958 --> 19:35.083
Bumble loves bouncy balls!

19:36.958 --> 19:39.458
Those aren't bouncy balls,
they're potatoes!

19:39.458 --> 19:42.250
And they're ours!
We need them for Bob.

19:42.250 --> 19:44.000
Not anymore!

19:46.708 --> 19:48.166
Finders keepers!

19:49.208 --> 19:51.708
ARF will stop them
with knowledge.

19:51.708 --> 19:55.291
True fact: raw potatoes
are not dog food!

19:55.291 --> 19:58.583
(scoffs) We're not gonna
eat them, robot dog.

19:58.583 --> 20:00.125
We're just gonna chase them.

20:00.125 --> 20:02.000
So much for
the power of knowledge.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.166
Time to break out
the puppy eyes.

20:05.291 --> 20:09.208
Come on, guys.
Bob really needs those.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.375
Give them back.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.166
Puh-lease?

20:12.166 --> 20:14.416
Those sad eyes.

20:14.416 --> 20:15.833
Okay.

20:16.875 --> 20:19.125
They're ours now, remember?

20:19.125 --> 20:22.708
Oh, yeah! Reminders, sneakers!

20:23.875 --> 20:25.250
(sighs)

20:25.250 --> 20:27.166
It's finders, keepers, Bumble.

20:27.166 --> 20:29.291
Oh yeah, right.
Finders keepers!

20:29.291 --> 20:31.083
Now guard this tunnel.

20:31.083 --> 20:34.208
Nothing gets in
and nothing goes out.

20:37.583 --> 20:39.875
We're smaller than
those big dogs.

20:39.875 --> 20:42.458
So, to get our potatoes back

20:42.458 --> 20:45.166
we'll have to break
a few eggs.

20:50.333 --> 20:53.708
Another bouncy ball!
Minders beepers!

20:53.708 --> 20:56.500
I mean, finders, keepers. Yeah.

21:01.416 --> 21:03.583
(softly): The potato has landed.

21:03.583 --> 21:05.250
Bumble! Steve!

21:05.250 --> 21:07.458
You like to play fetch, right?

21:07.458 --> 21:08.583
Doesn't everyone?

21:08.583 --> 21:09.583
Both:
(laughing) Yeah.

21:09.583 --> 21:10.708
Bumble loves fetch.

21:10.708 --> 21:13.083
Then, go fetch!

21:13.083 --> 21:15.583
-(both gasping)
-Even more bouncy balls.

21:20.416 --> 21:23.166
We got 'em, ARF!
Let's roll like a potato!

21:29.458 --> 21:31.875
The potatoes and eggs are clean!

21:31.875 --> 21:34.708
Now Bob can make the latkes
in time for the party!

21:34.708 --> 21:36.875
And he should have
plenty of ingredients.

21:36.875 --> 21:38.083
(front door opens)

21:38.083 --> 21:39.291
Oh, hi-ya guys.

21:39.291 --> 21:41.291
(both barking)

21:41.291 --> 21:42.458
Oh, it's almost sunset.

21:42.458 --> 21:45.125
I'd better make those latkes
before the party starts.

22:00.458 --> 22:03.416
-Mm! These latkes
are delicious, Bob.
-Mm! Mm-hmm.

22:03.416 --> 22:06.875
I didn't have as many eggs
and potatoes as I'd thought,

22:06.875 --> 22:09.416
it's a miracle
they made enough latkes.

22:09.416 --> 22:12.500
That reminds me of
the Hanukkah miracle
I've been told about:

22:12.500 --> 22:18.000
our ancestors thought they only
had enough oil for one day,
but it lasted for eight!

22:18.000 --> 22:19.291
We did it, Rolly.

22:19.291 --> 22:21.208
Bob made his latkes.

22:21.208 --> 22:24.250
I love it when
we accomplish a mission.

22:25.708 --> 22:27.291
Welcome to
your new home.

22:27.291 --> 22:29.500
I'm happy
you're here.

22:29.500 --> 22:31.166
We're happy to be here, too!

22:31.166 --> 22:33.458
She's not talking to us, Rolly.

22:33.458 --> 22:35.250
She's talking to...

22:35.250 --> 22:37.000
Cagey!

22:37.000 --> 22:38.208
Cagey's here?

22:38.208 --> 22:40.166
No way!

22:40.166 --> 22:41.291
Way!

22:41.291 --> 22:42.708
Hi, guys!

22:42.708 --> 22:44.250
Fancy meeting you here.

22:44.250 --> 22:46.458
Isn't my new family wonderful?

22:46.458 --> 22:49.708
Yeah, Chloe's great, and now
you're our next door neighbor!

22:51.166 --> 22:53.125
Mom, Dad, I see a star!

22:53.125 --> 22:55.583
Let's light
the Hanukkah candles!

22:55.583 --> 22:59.000
-(Bob and Chloe's Mom gasp)
-Everybody, gather around.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.083
We light the Hanukkiyah
to remember how

23:01.083 --> 23:02.833
our ancestors worked together

23:02.833 --> 23:04.875
and stood up for
what they believed in,

23:04.875 --> 23:06.291
even though it was hard.

23:06.291 --> 23:09.875
And lighting the candles
reminds us to stand up
for what's right, too.

23:09.875 --> 23:11.875
That sounds like
what we did today!

23:11.875 --> 23:13.875
It really was
a Hanukkah mission!

23:13.875 --> 23:18.125
But our favorite part
of Hanukkah is spending time
with friends and family.

23:18.125 --> 23:20.583
And puppies and guinea pigs!

23:20.583 --> 23:22.000
Happy Hanukkah, Bingo!

23:22.000 --> 23:23.250
You too, Rolly!

23:25.208 --> 23:27.583
-Happy Hanukkah, everyone!
-Happy Hanukkah!

23:27.583 --> 23:29.416
Bob: Happy Hanukkah!

23:32.416 --> 23:34.458
(theme music playing)

23:35.583 --> 23:37.250
Bark, bark, bark!

23:40.708 --> 23:42.291
Bark, bark, bark!

23:43.458 --> 23:46.291
(barking)

23:51.708 --> 23:53.250
Bark!

23:56.291 --> 23:58.500
Bark, bark, bark!
