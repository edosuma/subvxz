Previously
on "Criminal Minds"...

00:04.279 --> 00:06.490
Look, a while back I had some
medical issues, headaches,

00:06.590 --> 00:08.529
and there was a geneticist
that I reached out to.

00:08.729 --> 00:10.412
I guess I just-- I think
it's funny how we've been doing

00:10.414 --> 00:13.265
this for 6 months
and we've never met.

00:13.267 --> 00:14.883
Do you think he knows
about us?

00:14.885 --> 00:16.268
As far as I can tell,
he doesn't.

00:16.270 --> 00:18.654
Well, I guess I'll talk
to you next Sunday.

00:18.656 --> 00:20.689
Bye. Love you.

00:20.691 --> 00:24.693
Well, if you've got somebody
new in your life to talk to,

00:24.695 --> 00:26.495
I'd just like to know
who she is.

00:26.497 --> 00:28.897
'Cause she's gotta be one hell
of a woman to keep up with you.

00:28.899 --> 00:30.666
I think the stalker's gone.

00:30.668 --> 00:32.167
The emails have stopped.

00:32.168 --> 00:34.086
What about the phone calls?
No, I haven't gotten any.

00:34.088 --> 00:36.755
No more heavy breathing
on the machine. No more hangups.

00:36.757 --> 00:39.074
Is this about
phone booth girl?

00:39.076 --> 00:40.592
She wants to meet.

00:40.594 --> 00:42.044
Wait,
you guys have never met?

00:42.046 --> 00:43.912
Aren't you curious
what she looks like?

00:43.914 --> 00:46.382
No, it doesn't matter
what she looks like. I mean,

00:46.384 --> 00:49.751
she's already the most beautiful girl
in the world to me.

Hello?

01:00.564 --> 01:02.731
Maeve, it's me. Listen, don't come
to the restaurant.

01:02.733 --> 01:04.816
What are you talking about?
I'm outside.

01:04.819 --> 01:05.784
Go home.

01:05.786 --> 01:08.120
Look, I think
your stalker's here.

01:41.304 --> 01:43.489
Have you the ring?

01:50.980 --> 01:52.614
Place the ring
on her finger.

01:52.616 --> 01:54.483
On whose finger?

01:55.668 --> 01:57.836
Oh.

02:06.679 --> 02:08.514
I now pronounce you smart

02:08.515 --> 02:09.882
and smarter.

02:09.883 --> 02:11.717
Let's get to it, you two.

02:11.719 --> 02:12.834
Get to what?

02:12.836 --> 02:15.220
Kiss her, dummy.

03:02.653 --> 03:03.769
Hello.

03:03.771 --> 03:06.105
Hello.
I have a collect call from...

03:06.107 --> 03:09.491
Adam Worth.

03:09.493 --> 03:11.393
Operator; Do you accept
the charges?

03:11.395 --> 03:12.528
Yes.

03:12.530 --> 03:16.165
Please deposit $2.00
for the first two minutes.

03:27.410 --> 03:29.077
Thank you.

03:30.414 --> 03:33.215
Hello. I'm still here.

03:33.217 --> 03:37.603
Zug...zwang.

03:38.888 --> 03:41.640
I'm sorry, can you
please repeat that?

03:41.642 --> 03:43.108
Zug...

03:43.110 --> 03:45.060
zwang.

03:47.431 --> 03:49.764
I got here as quickly
as I could.

03:49.766 --> 03:51.400
What's wrong?

03:51.402 --> 03:53.285
I need to tell you
something.

03:56.789 --> 03:59.774
Our correspondence started
10 months ago.

03:59.776 --> 04:02.961
She wrote me a compliment on my
"Journal of Behavioral Psych" article,

04:02.963 --> 04:04.921
and for 3 months,
this is how we communicated

04:04.946 --> 04:06.249
because she was scared.

04:06.250 --> 04:07.949
Scared of whom?

04:07.951 --> 04:11.286
She didn't know,
only that he was dangerous.

04:11.288 --> 04:13.863
Horribly threatening
phone calls, letters, emails,

04:13.888 --> 04:15.291
no matter where she moved.

04:15.292 --> 04:18.125
It's why I never called her
from the same phone booth twice.

04:18.128 --> 04:19.478
You don't know
what Maeve looks like?

04:19.480 --> 04:20.478
No.

04:20.481 --> 04:21.512
Or where she works?

04:21.515 --> 04:22.981
No. I know
she's a geneticist.

04:22.983 --> 04:24.833
Do you even know
her last name?

04:27.070 --> 04:29.988
Then I have to ask you,
how do you know she's missing?

04:29.990 --> 04:32.157
Because we always addressed
our letters to pseudonyms.

04:32.159 --> 04:33.775
And you're
Dr. Joseph Bell?

04:33.777 --> 04:36.161
The real-life inspiration
for Sherlock Holmes.

04:36.163 --> 04:38.480
And that codename
is how I know she's in trouble.

04:38.482 --> 04:42.084
The voice on the phone
identified himself as Adam Worth.

04:42.086 --> 04:44.597
That was the American criminal
that Arthur Conan Doyle based

04:44.622 --> 04:46.456
the character of Moriarty on.

04:46.457 --> 04:48.090
And what did he say
to you?

04:48.092 --> 04:50.325
Zugzwang.

04:50.327 --> 04:52.327
It's a chess term.

04:52.329 --> 04:53.879
It describes the point
in a game

04:53.881 --> 04:57.015
when a player realizes
he'll inevitably be checkmated.

04:57.017 --> 04:59.184
He has to decide
whether to resign

04:59.186 --> 05:02.104
or to play through
to the bitter end.

05:02.106 --> 05:04.056
If you're right about this,

05:04.058 --> 05:07.392
then you're part of
his victimology, too.

05:07.394 --> 05:11.012
I know.

05:11.014 --> 05:12.731
He thinks he'll get away
with this,

05:12.733 --> 05:15.484
and he might.

05:15.486 --> 05:18.853
I have a wealth of knowledge
I should be applying to this case.

05:18.855 --> 05:21.356
Behavioral patterns
of violent stalkers.

05:21.358 --> 05:23.041
Tactical recovery
strategies.

05:23.043 --> 05:24.576
Victim survival odds.

05:24.578 --> 05:27.246
But right now I can't
focus on anything

05:27.248 --> 05:29.081
more than 4 seconds
at a time.

05:29.083 --> 05:31.250
Which makes me the dumbest
person in the room.

05:31.252 --> 05:33.385
So...

05:33.387 --> 05:36.471
Please help me.

05:36.473 --> 05:38.307
Help me find her.

05:39.592 --> 05:41.977
We don't know
if we have a case.

05:43.212 --> 05:45.147
So we'll be working
on personal time.

05:46.249 --> 05:48.600
Does anybody want to leave?

05:51.554 --> 05:52.738
Good.

05:52.740 --> 05:53.971
Let's get to work.

Lao Tsu.

06:38.455 --> 06:41.457
Based on Maeve's description
of the unsub in her letters,

06:41.459 --> 06:43.459
he seems like a classically
possessive stalker.

06:43.461 --> 06:46.128
One who craves validation
and recognition.

06:46.130 --> 06:49.515
"What won't you see me?"
"Do you think you're better than me?"

06:49.517 --> 06:52.351
This comes up
again and again.

06:52.353 --> 06:54.003
So does his suicidal
ideation.

06:54.005 --> 06:56.355
"When I find you,
I'm going to kill you, then myself."

06:56.357 --> 06:57.940
Murder-suicide
is the ultimate

06:57.942 --> 07:00.059
"I love you"
to these guys.

07:00.061 --> 07:02.344
When did the unsub
start targeting Maeve?

07:02.346 --> 07:04.230
Maeve said it started
out of the blue.

07:04.232 --> 07:06.682
My guess is it was some sort
of incidental interaction,

07:06.684 --> 07:08.701
something she probably
wasn't even aware of.

07:08.703 --> 07:10.686
That's gonna make the unsub
hard to find.

07:10.688 --> 07:13.122
And Maeve, too, until
we know more about her.

07:13.124 --> 07:15.190
I found her.

07:15.192 --> 07:17.076
There are not many geneticists
with that name, but...

07:17.078 --> 07:19.045
Dr. Maeve Donovan
took a sabbatical

07:19.047 --> 07:21.080
from Mendel University
10 months ago.

07:21.082 --> 07:23.165
That fits the timeline.

07:23.167 --> 07:25.468
Oh, she's a smart cookie.
She burned her credit history,

07:25.470 --> 07:28.671
but her parents rented a loft
in the warehouse district 5 days ago.

07:28.673 --> 07:30.423
Did the parents sell
their house recently?

07:30.425 --> 07:31.390
No.

07:31.392 --> 07:32.892
They might be
helping her hide.

07:32.894 --> 07:34.894
Morgan, you and JJ
go to the loft.

07:34.896 --> 07:37.096
Blake and Dave, go to the lab.

07:37.098 --> 07:38.598
How clear is your head?

07:38.600 --> 07:40.099
Not very clear.

07:40.101 --> 07:43.236
I want to talk to her parents, but I
want you to observe the interview.

07:43.238 --> 07:45.488
Reid.

07:45.490 --> 07:48.941
I have a picture of her. Do you
want to see what she looks like?

07:48.943 --> 07:50.826
No.

08:05.876 --> 08:09.011
So what are we, 10 miles
outside of the city?

08:09.013 --> 08:12.398
Her parents wanted to put some distance
between her and her stalker,

08:12.400 --> 08:16.185
but they may have just
made her an easier target.

08:33.986 --> 08:36.155
FBI.

08:36.157 --> 08:38.491
Anybody home?

08:46.500 --> 08:48.134
It's clear.

08:48.136 --> 08:50.920
This is definitely
a crime scene.

08:50.922 --> 08:52.788
Must have been
a hell of a fight.

08:52.790 --> 08:55.508
Smash...

09:01.515 --> 09:03.899
Then hit.

09:03.901 --> 09:05.568
There's no sign of forced entry.

09:05.570 --> 09:07.186
Maeve was on high alert.

09:07.188 --> 09:08.804
Exactly.

09:08.806 --> 09:12.191
Then how did this unsub
get her to let her guard down?

09:18.749 --> 09:20.366
Here you go.

09:20.368 --> 09:22.702
That's the personnel files
of everyone in the lab.

09:22.704 --> 09:24.203
Not much there.

09:24.205 --> 09:26.589
Only 5 docs work here
besides her.

09:26.591 --> 09:27.923
And they're all men.

09:27.925 --> 09:30.826
Did any of them take
a particular interest in her work?

09:30.828 --> 09:32.712
We all did.
Her last project

09:32.714 --> 09:35.214
on cyclic adenosine
monophosphate--

09:35.216 --> 09:37.499
revolutionary stuff.
Quite frankly,

09:37.501 --> 09:39.935
she made connections
before I could even see them.

09:39.937 --> 09:42.438
We know the feeling.

09:42.440 --> 09:44.607
When was the last time
that you spoke to Maeve?

09:44.609 --> 09:46.225
6 days ago.

09:46.227 --> 09:49.028
5, after we got her
situated in the loft.

09:49.030 --> 09:51.346
Why didn't she leave
the D.C. area?

09:51.348 --> 09:52.681
I have health issues.

09:52.683 --> 09:54.183
Cancer.

09:54.185 --> 09:55.868
And she wanted
to stay close.

09:55.870 --> 09:58.537
We were working on
an oncology project together,

09:58.539 --> 10:01.123
and it was easier
to share data if she was nearby.

10:01.125 --> 10:02.625
You're a geneticist, too?

10:02.627 --> 10:04.210
Retired.

10:04.212 --> 10:07.646
I got out when I heard there
was a new Dr. Donovan in town.

10:07.648 --> 10:09.982
I know this is difficult
for both of you,

10:09.984 --> 10:11.717
but is there anyone
that you suspect?

10:11.719 --> 10:13.035
Bobby.

10:13.037 --> 10:15.137
The police ruled him out
early on,

10:15.139 --> 10:16.705
but we never liked him.

10:16.707 --> 10:17.706
Who is Bobby?

10:17.708 --> 10:19.175
Her fiance.

10:19.177 --> 10:22.511
And there were issues?

10:22.513 --> 10:24.680
Bobby was her first
serious relationship.

10:24.682 --> 10:26.816
It was only till
after they got engaged

10:26.818 --> 10:28.434
that she realized that...

10:28.436 --> 10:30.436
He was a controlling
bastard.

10:30.438 --> 10:32.221
Sorry.

10:32.223 --> 10:33.239
But it's true.

10:33.241 --> 10:35.274
Well, we need
to talk to him.

10:35.276 --> 10:36.876
Fiance?

10:36.878 --> 10:38.494
Reid, slow down.

10:38.496 --> 10:40.663
She had a fiance, Hotch.

10:40.665 --> 10:42.564
Let us handle it.

10:42.566 --> 10:45.501
Robert Putnam.

10:45.503 --> 10:47.903
FBI.

10:50.624 --> 10:51.707
Who?

10:51.709 --> 10:53.259
We're looking for
Robert Putnam.

10:53.261 --> 10:54.460
Do you know where he is?

10:54.462 --> 10:55.594
He's in the back.

10:55.596 --> 10:57.246
We need to talk to him.

10:58.598 --> 11:00.082
And who are you?

11:00.084 --> 11:01.884
I'm Diane, his girlfriend.

11:01.886 --> 11:02.918
Hey, sweetheart,
who is it?

11:02.920 --> 11:05.271
Robert Putnam,
we'd like to--

11:11.445 --> 11:12.645
I know you.

11:12.647 --> 11:14.396
Out.

11:14.398 --> 11:16.081
Out.

11:16.083 --> 11:17.599
Wait, I need to talk
to him, Hotch.

11:17.601 --> 11:19.318
Why did he just
recognize you?

11:19.320 --> 11:21.787
A couple of weeks ago,
Maeve and I were gonna meet.

11:21.789 --> 11:23.438
He was at the restaurant.
I caught him looking at me

11:23.440 --> 11:24.773
and something felt off
about him.

11:24.775 --> 11:26.408
And you're telling me
this now?

11:26.410 --> 11:28.610
I didn't know who he was
and then a friend of his sat down,

11:28.612 --> 11:30.079
so I just assumed
that I overreacted.

11:30.081 --> 11:31.714
Reid, if he's the unsub,
you're a material witness.

11:31.716 --> 11:36.802
You can't be in there.
You know that. Stay here.

11:38.789 --> 11:40.122
Look, what's going on?

11:40.124 --> 11:41.307
Where's Maeve?

11:41.309 --> 11:43.008
We were hoping
you knew.

11:43.010 --> 11:44.410
Why would I know?

11:44.412 --> 11:46.545
The same way that you knew
that she'd be at that restaurant

11:46.547 --> 11:48.197
two weeks ago.

11:48.199 --> 11:50.015
Care to explain?

11:50.017 --> 11:53.152
When she went into hiding,
she broke off the engagement.

11:53.154 --> 11:56.188
I needed to see her,
to make sure she was all right.

11:56.190 --> 11:58.190
So I hired
a private detective

11:58.192 --> 11:59.825
and he found her
through her parents.

11:59.827 --> 12:01.360
When she made the reservation,
I showed up, too.

12:01.362 --> 12:03.145
Why did you
bring a friend?

12:03.147 --> 12:05.781
Because there was a psychopath
after her, that's why.

12:05.783 --> 12:09.818
For someone madly in love,
you sure moved on in a hurry.

12:09.820 --> 12:12.421
Maeve told me to.

12:12.423 --> 12:14.840
And apparently
she took her own advice.

12:14.842 --> 12:16.509
Did that make you mad?

12:16.511 --> 12:18.127
Mad enough to hurt her?

12:18.129 --> 12:21.547
Mad enough to stalk
the man that she was meeting?

12:24.634 --> 12:27.770
There's something over there
on that table I'm gonna go get.

12:27.772 --> 12:29.889
Don't shoot me.

12:36.029 --> 12:37.530
He sent these to us,

12:37.532 --> 12:39.949
the last month
of our engagement.

12:43.203 --> 12:45.371
The fact is,

12:45.373 --> 12:47.540
I was being stalked, too.

12:59.586 --> 13:02.137
Excuse me, Doctor.

13:02.139 --> 13:05.975
Agent Hotchner said
he was done with me upstairs.

13:05.977 --> 13:09.261
Can you tell me
what's going on?

13:09.263 --> 13:11.597
We'll be in touch, ma'am.

13:11.599 --> 13:13.065
Thank you.

13:16.236 --> 13:18.654
All right, kid,
talk to me.

13:18.656 --> 13:21.023
I can tell you're adding
something up in your head.

13:21.025 --> 13:22.191
What is it?

13:22.193 --> 13:23.909
2,412.

13:25.913 --> 13:28.247
It's the number of hours
we spent communicating,

13:28.249 --> 13:31.700
counting phone calls
and letters.

13:31.702 --> 13:34.119
That's about 100 days.

13:34.121 --> 13:36.205
100.5. What if
that's all I get?

13:36.207 --> 13:37.256
Well, it's not.

13:37.258 --> 13:38.591
You can't say that.

13:38.593 --> 13:39.908
Yes, I can.

13:39.910 --> 13:42.911
Because when
we find her alive

13:42.913 --> 13:45.631
and you finally get to
lay your eyes on her,

13:45.633 --> 13:48.934
what's the first thing
you're gonna say to her?

13:50.804 --> 13:53.422
A couple of months ago
we were getting off the phone

13:53.424 --> 13:56.225
and she said,

13:56.227 --> 13:58.527
"Bye. Love you."

13:58.529 --> 13:59.812
Just like that.

13:59.814 --> 14:01.614
"Bye. Love you."

14:05.435 --> 14:08.370
I know it was
just a slip, but--

14:08.372 --> 14:10.239
but she said it, Reid.

14:10.241 --> 14:12.441
She said it.

14:13.627 --> 14:16.778
You didn't say it back
to her, did you?

14:19.282 --> 14:22.167
I was waiting for when
we finally met.

14:27.223 --> 14:29.058
Ok, I'm sharing something
I haven't told anyone.

14:29.060 --> 14:30.792
Every time
we have a stalking case,

14:30.794 --> 14:33.145
I think Rosanna Arquette.

14:33.147 --> 14:35.514
The whole Arquette
family to choose from

14:35.516 --> 14:37.066
and you go with Rosanna.

14:37.068 --> 14:40.235
If course I go with Rosanna,
because Rosanna Arquette

14:40.237 --> 14:44.189
was the inspiration for
two seminal songs of my childhood.

14:44.191 --> 14:45.991
"Rosanna," by Toto...

14:45.993 --> 14:47.743
Obviously.

14:47.745 --> 14:49.745
And "In Your Eyes"
by Peter Gabriel.

14:49.747 --> 14:51.030
Which gives one pause

14:51.032 --> 14:53.749
to think of
the myriad of ways

14:53.751 --> 14:55.617
a man can be obsessed
by a woman,

14:55.619 --> 14:57.670
and what is she doing in bed

14:57.672 --> 15:01.040
to inspire that kind of
obsession, and can she teach us?

15:01.042 --> 15:02.257
Because I want to know.

15:02.259 --> 15:04.209
Whoa.

15:06.763 --> 15:08.681
He went to town
on that one.

15:08.683 --> 15:11.550
JJ, is that...

15:13.669 --> 15:15.888
I don't get it.
I mean, I see the message,

15:15.890 --> 15:17.890
"I'm obliterating you,"
but we already knew that.

15:17.892 --> 15:19.525
No, see, it's not about
the message.

15:19.527 --> 15:21.777
It's about the medium,
what he used to draw on her face.

15:21.779 --> 15:23.195
Spence...

15:24.614 --> 15:26.648
It's black eyeliner.

15:27.784 --> 15:29.118
The stalker's a woman.

15:29.120 --> 15:31.353
That's why she masked
her voice on the phone.

15:31.355 --> 15:32.854
That's why Maeve
let her in to her loft.

15:32.856 --> 15:34.856
She thought what we thought,
that her stalker was a man.

15:34.858 --> 15:36.742
But the question is,
how could this unsub

15:36.744 --> 15:38.494
have known about
Maeve and you?

15:43.967 --> 15:47.052
Hotch, did you ever identify me
to Bobby Putnam's girlfriend?

15:47.054 --> 15:48.587
What?
Did you say my name to her?

15:48.589 --> 15:50.255
Did you call me Dr. Reid
or Agent Reid?

15:50.257 --> 15:52.157
I never mentioned you
at all. Why?

15:53.093 --> 15:55.043
Excuse me, Doctor.

15:55.045 --> 15:57.930
I think I know
who the unsub is.

15:57.932 --> 15:59.431
Hey, honey.

15:59.433 --> 16:00.882
Hey.

16:00.884 --> 16:05.187
You're still thinking
about him, aren't you?

16:05.189 --> 16:06.288
Yes.

16:06.290 --> 16:08.890
Are you sure
that he was the one

16:08.892 --> 16:11.527
at the restaurant?

16:11.529 --> 16:13.728
Yes.

16:13.730 --> 16:16.031
He's an FBI agent.

16:16.033 --> 16:17.699
Interesting.

16:17.701 --> 16:19.067
I'm sorry.

16:19.069 --> 16:22.037
I know I said
I'd let this go.

16:22.039 --> 16:24.873
It's okay. A part of me
wants answers

16:24.875 --> 16:26.792
just as much as you do.

16:27.794 --> 16:29.845
Is that new?

16:30.814 --> 16:32.247
Do you like it?

16:32.249 --> 16:35.350
I--I've never seen you
dressed like that before.

16:35.352 --> 16:38.187
No, you haven't, in fact.

16:38.189 --> 16:40.739
I've been waiting months
for you to notice me.

16:40.741 --> 16:43.925
Notice that I'm better,
sexier, smarter than her.

16:43.927 --> 16:46.645
It's not until I debase
myself, then you notice.

16:46.647 --> 16:48.947
What are you talking about?

16:50.450 --> 16:52.434
Do you like this, Bobby?

16:52.436 --> 16:55.320
Because you have seen it
before.

16:56.456 --> 16:59.324
Is that...

16:59.326 --> 17:01.109
Diane,

17:01.111 --> 17:04.329
where did you get
Maeve's clothes?

17:08.334 --> 17:11.553
From her closet.

17:11.555 --> 17:14.556
Right after
I bashed her head in.

17:18.845 --> 17:20.813
She finally saw me,

17:20.815 --> 17:22.431
just like you see me now.

17:22.433 --> 17:24.398
Take a look, Bobby.

17:27.020 --> 17:29.605
Take a good look.

17:37.168 --> 17:38.633
What have we got?

17:38.634 --> 17:40.250
Well, she knew
we were close,

17:40.252 --> 17:41.551
so she came back
for the fiance.

17:41.553 --> 17:43.136
Looks like they had
a normal conversation,

17:43.138 --> 17:44.588
then she got violent. Same thing
that happened to Maeve.

17:45.874 --> 17:47.808
Hey, dollface,
what do you got?

17:47.810 --> 17:49.977
An identity
that's pure vapor.

17:49.979 --> 17:52.145
Diane Huntington is a fake name.
So is her address.

17:52.147 --> 17:53.405
And all the phone conversations
she had with Bobby

17:53.430 --> 17:54.899
were from a burner phone.

17:54.900 --> 17:57.985
All right, keep digging
and keep us posted.

17:57.987 --> 17:59.853
We need to
rethink the profile,

17:59.855 --> 18:02.239
reset everything
that we know about Maeve

18:02.241 --> 18:04.691
through the prism of
one woman stalking another.

18:12.617 --> 18:14.751
You know...

18:14.753 --> 18:18.372
I couldn't understand it,
Bobby.

18:18.374 --> 18:19.873
I really couldn't.

18:22.760 --> 18:25.545
You could have had me.

18:25.547 --> 18:28.131
Instead you wanted that.

18:29.050 --> 18:30.434
Maeve?

18:30.436 --> 18:32.853
I'm so sorry.

18:32.855 --> 18:35.472
Why are you doing this?

18:35.474 --> 18:36.473
Why?

18:36.475 --> 18:38.141
Let's just say

18:38.143 --> 18:41.094
she took something from me
that I can't get back.

18:41.096 --> 18:43.730
So I decided
if I can't have my life,

18:43.732 --> 18:45.148
I'm gonna take hers.

18:46.652 --> 18:48.768
What is she talking about?

18:48.770 --> 18:51.405
I don't know.
I don't--I don't know

18:51.407 --> 18:53.273
who she is.

18:53.275 --> 18:55.826
After hunting her
for 10 months,

18:55.828 --> 18:58.078
after stealing her man,

18:58.080 --> 19:03.450
I had to stop and say, what I
so freakin' special about her?

19:03.452 --> 19:04.951
I couldn't see it.

19:04.953 --> 19:07.671
Until I saw him.

19:07.673 --> 19:08.889
Him who?

19:08.891 --> 19:11.958
The night you followed her,
I followed you.

19:11.960 --> 19:14.294
And I saw him.

19:14.296 --> 19:17.314
I want what they have.

19:17.316 --> 19:18.598
I want him.

19:18.600 --> 19:19.983
That's why you're doing this?

19:19.985 --> 19:22.302
Because of that stupid
FBI agent?

19:22.304 --> 19:26.023
That stupid FBI agent is
he reason why you're still alive.

19:26.025 --> 19:28.241
You're gonna get her
to tell me about him.

19:28.243 --> 19:30.777
I don't want to hear
what she has to say.

19:30.779 --> 19:33.080
I know.

19:34.832 --> 19:37.951
But that wasn't a request.

19:37.953 --> 19:39.986
Ok, we know numbers
on female stalkers are minimal.

19:39.988 --> 19:41.654
Only 10% of all cases
are female.

19:41.656 --> 19:43.590
All right, what tops
the list of motivators?

19:43.592 --> 19:45.992
Prior sexual intimacy.

19:45.994 --> 19:47.660
Erotomania?

19:47.662 --> 19:49.129
No. Go the other direction.

19:49.131 --> 19:50.514
Think female scorned.

19:50.516 --> 19:52.132
We slept together.
You broke up with me.

19:52.134 --> 19:53.717
Now I'll do anything
to get back with you.

19:53.719 --> 19:55.852
Reid, could that
have fit Maeve?

19:55.854 --> 19:59.773
Could she have possibly been in
a relationship with this woman?

20:00.725 --> 20:02.675
No. No.

20:02.677 --> 20:06.063
Spence, this morning you didn't know
that she was engaged.

20:06.065 --> 20:07.364
Yeah, but the answer is no.

20:07.366 --> 20:09.182
And what's the second-most
common motivation?

20:09.184 --> 20:11.118
Celebrity stalking.

20:11.120 --> 20:12.753
That fits better.

20:12.755 --> 20:15.789
Well, how? She's not famous.

20:15.791 --> 20:17.207
Maeve's a star
in her field, though.

20:17.209 --> 20:20.961
That's a stretch. Celebrity stalkers
are usually nonviolent.

20:20.963 --> 20:23.530
You want to tell that
to John Lennon, Rossi?

20:23.532 --> 20:25.665
What was it that Mark David
Chapman said after he shot him?

20:25.667 --> 20:27.033
"It was like all of my
nobody-ness

20:27.035 --> 20:28.668
and all of his somebody-ness
collided."

20:28.670 --> 20:32.889
Well, Maeve is somebody
and this bitch is a nobody.

20:35.877 --> 20:38.228
I'm sorry. I don't know
where that came from.

20:38.230 --> 20:40.747
Um, I can't be very helpful right now.
I should leave.

20:40.749 --> 20:42.215
Reid. Reid, yes, you can.

20:42.217 --> 20:45.018
You have 100.5 days of
communication with the girl

20:45.020 --> 20:47.354
and your brain lets you
recall every word verbatim.

20:47.356 --> 20:49.606
She probably revealed details
about the unsub to you

20:49.608 --> 20:51.241
and neither of you
even noticed.

20:51.243 --> 20:53.777
There's too much of it and I can't
sort through it with any clarity.

20:53.779 --> 20:57.364
Then pick one of us
and we'll go through it with you.

20:59.784 --> 21:01.451
Blake.

21:01.453 --> 21:03.370
Okay.

21:03.372 --> 21:06.039
Let's get out of here.

21:09.093 --> 21:10.510
You want to talk here?

21:10.512 --> 21:12.712
Yep.

21:12.714 --> 21:14.131
You play?

21:14.133 --> 21:17.017
Yeah, I know my way
around a board, but...

21:17.019 --> 21:18.301
that's not the point.

21:18.303 --> 21:21.938
I want you to focus here
and not on my questions.

21:21.940 --> 21:25.758
So, let's try this out.

21:25.760 --> 21:28.478
When you think of Maeve, what's
the first thing that comes to mind?

21:28.480 --> 21:30.313
Thomas Merton.

21:30.315 --> 21:31.314
What about him?

21:31.316 --> 21:32.432
In her letters,

21:32.434 --> 21:34.985
she would always
sign off with a quote

21:34.987 --> 21:36.903
from one of her favorite
philosophers.

21:36.905 --> 21:38.989
Camus, Voltaire, Plato.

21:38.991 --> 21:41.958
When we had the near miss
at the restaurant a couple of weeks ago,

21:41.960 --> 21:47.464
she left me a book with a quote
by Thomas Merton written inside.

21:48.299 --> 21:50.800
It said,
"Love is our true destiny.

21:50.802 --> 21:55.138
"We do not find the meaning
of life by ourselves alone.

21:55.140 --> 21:57.674
We find it in another."

21:58.676 --> 22:00.894
Then...

22:00.896 --> 22:04.231
Thomas Merton was her way
of saying good-bye.

22:04.233 --> 22:05.815
Yeah.

22:05.817 --> 22:07.017
So,

22:07.019 --> 22:09.802
let's talk about this. Hmm?

22:09.804 --> 22:11.755
Because this I didn't expect.

22:11.757 --> 22:13.940
Oh, I'm sorry.
Let me catch you up.

22:13.942 --> 22:16.009
I found these letters
in Maeve's loft,

22:16.011 --> 22:18.311
and I guess she didn't get
around to sending this one,

22:18.313 --> 22:21.164
and...it's really good.

22:21.166 --> 22:22.999
"I bought the blindfold today.

22:23.001 --> 22:25.869
I can't wait to use it."

22:27.322 --> 22:28.655
Blindfold.

22:28.657 --> 22:31.258
You know, I thought
I knew your fiancee.

22:31.260 --> 22:33.260
But I guess she's kinkier
than we thought.

22:33.262 --> 22:35.345
It's not what you think.

22:36.347 --> 22:38.548
"It's not what you think"
is girl code

22:38.550 --> 22:40.550
for "it's exactly
what you think."

22:40.552 --> 22:42.385
No, it's not
what you think.

22:42.387 --> 22:44.471
Did you sleep with him?

22:44.473 --> 22:46.506
I never even saw him.

22:46.508 --> 22:49.809
Why risk your life
to meet him?

22:49.811 --> 22:52.779
I've been alone for so long,
I just wanted to be with somebody.

22:52.781 --> 22:54.314
You could have been with Bobby.

22:54.316 --> 22:55.782
It was different with him.

22:55.784 --> 22:58.401
Different how?

22:58.403 --> 22:59.986
He was just...

22:59.988 --> 23:02.289
He was just what, Maeve?

23:02.291 --> 23:04.991
When we would talk,
I would...

23:04.993 --> 23:07.043
It was effortless.

23:08.129 --> 23:10.497
That is so interesting.

23:10.499 --> 23:12.215
Really.

23:12.217 --> 23:13.800
So if you two
had this deep connection

23:13.802 --> 23:15.719
where you're talking
in your own code,

23:15.721 --> 23:18.722
why do you think the unsub
would attack the fiance first?

23:18.724 --> 23:20.423
I don't know,
access, maybe.

23:20.425 --> 23:24.761
No, something links the two of you
in the unsub's mind.

23:24.763 --> 23:28.732
She wants to destroy anyone Maeve
had a romantic relationship with?

23:28.734 --> 23:31.384
It could be jealousy
or revenge.

23:31.386 --> 23:34.854
Maybe Maeve got in the way
of one of her old relationships?

23:34.856 --> 23:37.240
It's just not her.

23:37.242 --> 23:40.026
You see, when men cheat,

23:40.028 --> 23:41.611
it's below the belt.

23:41.613 --> 23:43.896
But when women cheat,

23:43.898 --> 23:45.782
it's above the neck.

23:45.784 --> 23:47.951
No. We were broken up.
I never cheated on you.

23:47.953 --> 23:49.419
But you didn't love me.

23:49.421 --> 23:51.404
Not like that.

23:52.923 --> 23:55.074
Now you know how I felt,

23:55.076 --> 23:57.744
to be ignored, cast aside.

23:57.746 --> 24:00.180
It's not fun, is it?

24:00.182 --> 24:02.182
Just let us go, D--

24:02.184 --> 24:04.467
what else do you want?!

24:04.469 --> 24:07.253
Did you guys ever
compare lists?

24:07.255 --> 24:11.057
The different people
you dated?

24:11.059 --> 24:12.942
November 4, 3:46 p.m.

24:12.944 --> 24:15.478
I asked her if she dated
a lot growing up.

24:15.480 --> 24:17.096
No way.

24:17.098 --> 24:19.282
Do you know how many
Friday nights I had

24:19.284 --> 24:21.484
where it was just me
and a microscope?

24:21.486 --> 24:22.819
I thought that was just me.

24:22.821 --> 24:24.454
Oh, come on.

24:24.456 --> 24:27.324
Girls must have adored
you in high school.

24:27.326 --> 24:31.161
I was 12.
It was kind of confusing.

24:31.163 --> 24:35.415
Once I got a note
from this girl I had a crush on.

24:35.417 --> 24:36.883
She thought I was cute

24:36.885 --> 24:39.669
but would only meet me
if I wore a blindfold.

24:39.671 --> 24:43.223
I did. And she took
my shirt off.

24:43.225 --> 24:45.975
That's when I heard
the laughter.

24:45.977 --> 24:48.812
Most of the senior class
was in there.

24:48.814 --> 24:51.181
Oh, it sounds awful.

24:51.183 --> 24:52.766
Maeve thought so, too.

24:52.768 --> 24:54.484
When we finally meet,

24:54.486 --> 24:57.103
I'm going to make
blindfolds fun again.

24:57.105 --> 25:00.907
You had him eating out of the
palm of your hand every Sunday

25:00.909 --> 25:03.693
and he never even
saw your face.

25:03.695 --> 25:07.080
I have to admit
that takes skill.

25:07.082 --> 25:09.165
That takes finesse.

25:10.918 --> 25:13.253
How'd you do it?

25:15.172 --> 25:16.172
Hello!

25:16.174 --> 25:18.258
Doctor, are you in there?

25:18.260 --> 25:20.827
Seriously?

25:20.829 --> 25:23.880
Okay, fine.

25:24.932 --> 25:26.666
Just tell her.

25:26.668 --> 25:30.387
There was a moment
when you had him

25:30.389 --> 25:32.188
and you knew you had him.

25:32.190 --> 25:33.940
What was it?

25:33.942 --> 25:37.727
Euclidean geometry.

25:40.197 --> 25:43.199
There's this thing called
the Penrose triangle.

25:43.201 --> 25:45.952
He told me a story about how
he tried to build one when he was 8.

25:45.954 --> 25:47.737
This better get sexy quick.
I'm getting bored.

25:47.739 --> 25:49.622
You can't build it.

25:49.624 --> 25:51.624
It's an impossible
physical structure.

25:51.626 --> 25:54.377
It only exists in
conceptual geometry.

25:54.379 --> 25:59.416
But I said, every Penrose
triangle has its thorns.

25:59.418 --> 26:02.001
And he laughed.

26:02.003 --> 26:04.471
It was a stupid pun,

26:04.473 --> 26:06.890
but he laughed.

26:06.892 --> 26:09.476
That's it.

26:10.978 --> 26:12.929
What about co-workers?

26:12.931 --> 26:15.899
Maeve was the only
female doctor at Mendel University.

26:15.901 --> 26:17.150
What was it like for her?

26:17.152 --> 26:19.152
She once spoke about
the awkwardness

26:19.154 --> 26:21.404
of being the only woman
in the department.

26:21.406 --> 26:24.274
When men are jealous
of your success in the lab,

26:24.276 --> 26:25.825
they want it
for themselves.

26:25.827 --> 26:28.561
But women want it
so you can't have it.

26:28.563 --> 26:31.664
Sometimes this institution
turns us against each other.

26:31.666 --> 26:35.084
What if the unsub worked there
but wasn't a doctor?

26:35.086 --> 26:36.453
What if she was a grad student

26:36.455 --> 26:38.588
maybe working on
her Ph.D. there?

26:38.590 --> 26:40.072
Yeah, but how could
Maeve miss her?

26:40.074 --> 26:41.674
Each of the doctors
has their own project.

26:41.676 --> 26:43.259
Each project has its own team
of research assistants.

26:43.261 --> 26:44.844
They don't mingle, but
they'd be the first applicants

26:44.846 --> 26:45.912
for an open position.

26:45.914 --> 26:48.080
And if Maeve rejected
her thesis,

26:48.082 --> 26:49.432
the unsub would
take it personally.

26:49.434 --> 26:52.852
And that rejection has become
an obsession to possess.

26:55.473 --> 26:58.090
I want to see
what he sees.

26:58.092 --> 26:59.976
He sees you
as his equal.

26:59.978 --> 27:01.594
That's it, isn't it?

27:01.596 --> 27:04.747
I just--I have to let him see
that I'm on your level.

27:04.749 --> 27:07.734
Great. You figured it out.

27:07.736 --> 27:10.620
Now, please,
will you let us go?

27:10.622 --> 27:12.772
No.

27:12.774 --> 27:15.274
No.

27:15.276 --> 27:18.795
I have to show her that I can take
everything that she has.

27:18.797 --> 27:21.331
Then she's going
to remember me.

27:21.333 --> 27:24.584
You, however,
are superfluous.

27:26.086 --> 27:28.471
I'm sorry, Bobby.

27:28.473 --> 27:31.174
You've always been
the runner-up in this pageant.

27:31.176 --> 27:32.642
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

27:32.644 --> 27:35.094
Please. Please...
Don't hurt him.

27:35.096 --> 27:36.980
Please! Don't hurt him.
Please don't hurt him.

27:36.982 --> 27:37.981
Don't hurt him.

27:37.983 --> 27:39.899
Ohh!

27:48.398 --> 27:49.955
Her name is Diane Turner.
She worked

27:50.055 --> 27:52.022
as a research assistant
at Mendel University

27:52.024 --> 27:53.307
while Maeve was there.

27:53.309 --> 27:54.658
Did she apply
for a Ph.D. There?

27:54.660 --> 27:56.276
Yeah. She was one of a bunch
of internal applicants

27:56.278 --> 27:57.494
that got rejected.

27:57.496 --> 27:59.780
Looks like she left
not long after Maeve.

27:59.782 --> 28:03.250
Correct. She now works
at a local junior college.

28:03.252 --> 28:05.335
Dave, you, Reid, and JJ
take the residence.

28:05.337 --> 28:06.670
Blake and Morgan,
take the campus.

28:06.672 --> 28:08.122
What was her doctoral
thesis about?

28:08.124 --> 28:11.758
It says here, "Spontaneous cellular
death in suicide patients."

28:11.760 --> 28:13.910
There's her suicidal
ideation again.

28:13.912 --> 28:17.965
Except cells don't behave that way.
Why is she so obsessed with it?

28:31.813 --> 28:35.732
You still don't remember
who I am, do you?

28:35.734 --> 28:37.868
No.

28:37.870 --> 28:41.738
I've tried and tried
to remember and I can't.

28:41.740 --> 28:45.375
But whatever it is
I did to you, I'm sorry.

28:45.377 --> 28:49.413
Forgive me. Tell me what it is
you want me to say to you

28:49.415 --> 28:50.664
and I will say it.

28:50.666 --> 28:53.417
I just want this
to be over.

28:53.419 --> 28:55.702
I can do that.

29:10.151 --> 29:13.437
You just have to do
something for me first.

29:24.115 --> 29:27.084
Get up there.

29:28.703 --> 29:30.837
Why?

29:30.839 --> 29:33.090
Do it.

29:43.067 --> 29:46.103
Why don't you just kill me?

29:46.105 --> 29:47.888
I want to see
if you'll jump.

29:47.890 --> 29:49.806
It's my theory

29:49.808 --> 29:52.859
that when you make
a decision to give up

29:52.861 --> 29:55.812
that the cells in your
body start to die.

29:55.814 --> 29:57.364
Can you feel it?

29:57.366 --> 30:00.317
Your whole body
beginning to decay.

30:00.319 --> 30:02.869
It makes it easier
to want to kill yourself.

30:02.871 --> 30:06.373
Go. Go ahead,
prove my theory.

30:07.909 --> 30:09.710
I remember you.

30:16.884 --> 30:18.868
Clear!

30:19.804 --> 30:21.088
Clear.

30:25.677 --> 30:28.762
Is this a shrine
to her dead parents?

30:31.232 --> 30:34.384
Her parents
committed suicide.

30:34.386 --> 30:37.571
That explains
her obsession.

30:37.573 --> 30:40.691
Guys. She's watching us.

30:41.909 --> 30:44.111
Garcia.
What you got, mama grizzly?

30:44.113 --> 30:47.581
There's a web cam in here.
Can you hack the feed?

30:48.733 --> 30:50.417
I read your thesis,
didn't I?

30:50.419 --> 30:53.370
You turned me down because
you couldn't handle the competition.

30:53.372 --> 30:55.672
No. I turned you down
because your testing was flawed.

30:55.674 --> 30:57.708
It was not flawed!

31:01.462 --> 31:04.765
Your sample was biased.

31:04.767 --> 31:06.933
You included your parents.

31:06.935 --> 31:08.685
The science was sound.

31:08.687 --> 31:10.604
You didn't even read
the whole thing, did you?

31:10.606 --> 31:12.589
No, I did. I did.

31:12.591 --> 31:16.226
I did read it. And do you know
what I thought

31:16.228 --> 31:17.477
after I was finished?

31:17.479 --> 31:20.480
I thought,
whoever wrote this

31:20.482 --> 31:22.065
had suffered a tragedy.

31:22.067 --> 31:24.201
And I felt sorry
for your loss.

31:24.203 --> 31:25.602
But you don't get
a Ph.D.

31:25.604 --> 31:27.537
just because something bad
happened to you.

31:27.539 --> 31:28.538
No.

31:28.540 --> 31:30.540
You just couldn't see.

31:30.542 --> 31:33.827
You can't see
that I'm a genius!

31:33.829 --> 31:36.963
Genius? Do you know
what genius is?

31:36.965 --> 31:39.132
I know that I am one.

31:39.134 --> 31:42.052
Maybe.

31:42.054 --> 31:44.638
Maybe you do have
that gift.

31:44.640 --> 31:48.291
Maybe your theory
could have had merit.

31:48.293 --> 31:49.601
But we don't know.

31:49.626 --> 31:51.889
Because genius isn't
just one good idea

31:52.147 --> 31:54.564
or one successful
experiment, Diane.

31:54.566 --> 31:56.817
Genius is work.

31:56.819 --> 31:59.519
Thousands of hours
of work.

31:59.521 --> 32:01.471
Ohh...

32:01.473 --> 32:03.190
She's spoofing
the IP address

32:03.192 --> 32:04.775
and she's encrypted
the feed.

32:04.777 --> 32:07.327
In other words, like layman's terms,
this is gonna take a while.

32:07.329 --> 32:08.829
What are you doing?

32:08.831 --> 32:10.747
Making a deal.

32:10.749 --> 32:12.532
That's why
you didn't make it.

32:12.534 --> 32:15.202
You didn't do the work.

32:15.204 --> 32:16.870
But you could.

32:16.872 --> 32:19.756
Yeah, you could
do the work.

32:21.626 --> 32:23.927
I'll help you.

32:25.930 --> 32:27.714
Get on the ledge.

32:29.550 --> 32:31.017
Now!

32:31.019 --> 32:33.220
No. If you're gonna kill me,
you kill me.

32:33.222 --> 32:36.223
But I am not jumping. Because
I want to live long enough

32:36.225 --> 32:38.275
to see Spencer
arrest you.

32:55.209 --> 32:58.879
Spencer has a different idea.

33:02.968 --> 33:04.835
Hello.

33:04.837 --> 33:06.086
It's me.

33:06.088 --> 33:07.504
Are you okay?

33:07.506 --> 33:09.038
She killed Bobby.

33:09.040 --> 33:10.090
Are <i>you</i> okay?

33:10.092 --> 33:11.508
Yeah.

33:11.510 --> 33:14.644
I've got a concussion
and some bruising, but I'm okay.

33:14.646 --> 33:16.596
Can I talk to her?

33:18.015 --> 33:20.650
No. She's listening.

33:20.652 --> 33:22.402
Good.

33:22.404 --> 33:24.554
But I want to meet her.
I need to see her face to face.

33:24.556 --> 33:26.773
She has a message
she wants me to give you.

33:26.775 --> 33:27.891
What is it?

33:27.893 --> 33:31.060
The message is,
she left you a present.

33:31.062 --> 33:34.531
And if you want to find it,
it's easy as pie.

33:34.533 --> 33:37.150
What does that mean?
I don't understand what that means.

33:37.152 --> 33:38.285
Neither do I.

33:38.287 --> 33:39.736
Spencer, it's a trap.

33:39.738 --> 33:41.705
If you come here,
she's gonna kill you!

33:42.858 --> 33:44.341
I need a map of D.C.

33:44.343 --> 33:47.744
This is Diane Turner's
apartment.

33:47.746 --> 33:50.413
This is the nearest cell tower
her phone call to me pinged off of,

33:50.415 --> 33:53.183
which means this is the circle that
Maeve was telling me about.

33:53.185 --> 33:54.184
What circle?

33:54.186 --> 33:55.585
It was a clue
in Diane's message.

33:55.587 --> 33:57.637
Finding her would be
as easy as pie.

33:57.639 --> 33:59.222
Only she wasn't
referring to the food,

33:59.224 --> 34:01.808
she was referring to...

34:01.810 --> 34:03.026
Pi.

34:03.028 --> 34:04.644
Why would Diane
give you a clue?

34:04.646 --> 34:06.197
Maeve made a similar pun once.

34:06.222 --> 34:07.598
Now Diane wants me
to see her the same way,

34:07.599 --> 34:09.699
but brilliant, the smartest girl
in the room.

34:09.701 --> 34:12.268
All right, assuming that Diane
has a secondary location,

34:12.270 --> 34:13.786
where in the circle
would she hold Maeve?

34:13.789 --> 34:15.871
She'd need a building that would
allow for privacy and control,

34:15.873 --> 34:17.290
a closed garage
for prisoner transfer...

34:17.292 --> 34:18.542
If she's copying Maeve's life,

34:18.543 --> 34:20.210
it might be someplace
close to Maeve's apartment.

34:20.212 --> 34:21.495
There's nothing
in Diane's name.

34:21.496 --> 34:23.079
Well, what about
Maeve's name, or even Bobby's?

34:23.081 --> 34:24.915
Nope.
Maybe she forged his signature.

34:24.917 --> 34:27.283
What about Diane's parents?

34:27.284 --> 34:29.487
Yes. Yes. Diane rented a loft

34:29.513 --> 34:31.505
right next to Maeve's
in her parents' name.

34:31.507 --> 34:32.839
Reid.

34:32.841 --> 34:35.175
I can't let you be a part
of this takedown.

34:35.177 --> 34:37.177
We don't have a choice. If I don't
go in there, Maeve is dead.

34:37.179 --> 34:38.628
And if you do,
you're dead.

34:38.630 --> 34:40.063
Hotch, we've known
from the beginning

34:40.065 --> 34:41.348
she's on
a murder-suicide mission,

34:41.350 --> 34:43.817
but we never stopped to ask why
she's on that mission.

34:43.819 --> 34:45.768
We know now that it's because
she wants recognition,

34:45.771 --> 34:47.909
the type of recognition
she thinks Maeve gets,

34:47.934 --> 34:48.773
and I can give her that.

34:48.774 --> 34:49.806
How?

34:49.808 --> 34:52.641
I'm gonna tell her
that I love her.

35:08.775 --> 35:10.692
Hang on. I got a box
on the steps.

35:10.694 --> 35:12.477
That's the gift.

35:26.826 --> 35:29.160
What is that, a blindfold?

35:29.162 --> 35:32.214
Take your gun and vest off.

35:33.182 --> 35:35.500
Now come in alone.

35:35.502 --> 35:37.436
Reid.

36:01.878 --> 36:03.829
Put it on.

36:09.385 --> 36:11.253
Can I take the blindfold off?

36:11.255 --> 36:12.704
No.

36:18.878 --> 36:20.729
Hello.

36:20.731 --> 36:23.181
Hi.

36:23.183 --> 36:26.184
I was hoping you'd
figure out my riddle.

36:26.186 --> 36:28.270
I mean, I knew you would.

36:28.272 --> 36:32.324
The fun was just
how fast you'd do it.

36:32.326 --> 36:35.193
Oh, there's some
brains, too.

36:35.195 --> 36:37.279
It took me a long time.
To be honest,

36:37.281 --> 36:39.614
I was distracted
by your thesis.

36:41.701 --> 36:43.201
You read my thesis?

36:43.203 --> 36:45.253
I did. You know,
I think your writing

36:45.255 --> 36:47.756
puts you on the same
plane as Jonas Salk.

36:47.758 --> 36:50.241
I've already sent it
to the NIH.

36:50.243 --> 36:52.744
Flattery is not gonna
get you out of this.

36:52.746 --> 36:54.096
I know what's waiting
for me outside.

36:54.098 --> 36:55.964
I've arranged
for your freedom.

36:55.966 --> 36:58.850
The federal government doesn't
make deals with people like me.

36:58.852 --> 37:02.721
Not true. Nazi scientists were
recruited for the Manhattan Project.

37:02.723 --> 37:05.256
Mafia bosses are regularly
put into Witness Protection.

37:05.258 --> 37:07.559
If what you have
is valuable enough,

37:07.561 --> 37:09.811
the federal government
will work with you.

37:09.813 --> 37:12.397
And what you have
is very valuable.

37:12.399 --> 37:14.399
And what do I have,
Doctor?

37:14.401 --> 37:18.320
You have a brain that doesn't
play by normal societal rules.

37:18.322 --> 37:19.621
And I know
that all your life

37:19.623 --> 37:23.458
the people you care
about the most keep leaving.

37:23.460 --> 37:26.128
There's a part of you that thinks
it's because of that brain.

37:26.130 --> 37:30.448
Well, I'm here because
I'm not going to leave you.

37:30.450 --> 37:34.285
I'm here because...

37:34.287 --> 37:37.022
I just hope
that I get the chance.

37:37.024 --> 37:38.974
Chance at what?

37:38.976 --> 37:40.458
To be with you.

37:44.096 --> 37:46.765
Me for her.
That was the deal, right?

37:46.767 --> 37:51.686
You're choosing me
over her?

37:53.472 --> 37:55.657
Diane, how could it be
anyone else?

37:55.659 --> 37:58.142
Prove it.

37:58.144 --> 38:00.529
All right. How?

38:00.531 --> 38:03.632
Say it again.

38:03.634 --> 38:06.501
This time say it
to her face.

38:15.011 --> 38:17.212
I don't love you.

38:19.065 --> 38:20.665
Sorry.

38:21.651 --> 38:24.386
I understand.

38:27.723 --> 38:30.859
I don't need her anymore.

38:32.395 --> 38:34.026
Kill her and she won't
have to live with the

38:34.051 --> 38:35.768
fact that you're smarter.

38:38.234 --> 38:40.669
Let her live with
her irrelevancy.

38:56.085 --> 38:58.202
I just want her to see
one more thing.

39:19.108 --> 39:21.059
Liar.

39:22.828 --> 39:23.995
Liar!

39:25.916 --> 39:28.083
Let's go!
Shots fired!

39:35.091 --> 39:37.575
Stay back! Stay back!
Stay back!

39:37.577 --> 39:41.596
Stay back, stay back!

39:42.715 --> 39:46.101
Diane, Diane, there's
still a way out of this.

39:46.103 --> 39:47.919
You never wanted me.

39:47.921 --> 39:49.220
Never!

39:49.222 --> 39:51.089
You lied!
I didn't.

39:51.091 --> 39:53.692
Diane, I offered you
a deal and you can still take it.

39:53.694 --> 39:56.645
Me for her.
Let me take her place.

39:56.647 --> 39:58.262
You would do that?

39:58.264 --> 39:59.698
Yes.

39:59.700 --> 40:01.900
You would kill yourself
for her?

40:01.902 --> 40:03.234
Yes.

40:03.236 --> 40:05.870
Thomas Merton.

40:07.290 --> 40:09.574
Who's Thomas Merton?

40:09.576 --> 40:11.275
He knows.

40:11.277 --> 40:12.276
He knows.

40:12.278 --> 40:13.995
Who's Thomas Merton?

40:13.997 --> 40:15.297
Who is he?

40:15.299 --> 40:18.667
He's the one thing
you can never take from us.

40:20.419 --> 40:22.620
No.

40:23.973 --> 40:25.790
