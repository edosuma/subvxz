03:25.623 --> 03:27.083
Five months in Brazil.

03:27.208 --> 03:28.748
You're a hard man to find.

03:33.089 --> 03:34.839
You even have the accent right.

03:38.636 --> 03:40.216
I do say so.

03:41.347 --> 03:44.477
The principal I represent
has an offer for you.

03:44.559 --> 03:46.349
He would like three men killed.

03:46.436 --> 03:48.856
Each death must look like an accident.

03:48.938 --> 03:50.478
Your specialty, I believe.

03:52.400 --> 03:57.860
Seems that reports of your demise
have been greatly exaggerated.

03:57.947 --> 04:02.197
My principal could make that known
to certain... interested parties.

04:02.285 --> 04:07.785
Which means that your new life here
would end rather quickly.

04:08.625 --> 04:11.835
Or you can do the job
and go back to being dead.

04:12.629 --> 04:15.549
What's your pleasure, Senhor Otto Santos?

04:19.594 --> 04:21.184
Let me make a call.

04:24.015 --> 04:25.015
What are you doing?

04:27.477 --> 04:30.267
Tell your principal it never pays
to fuck with the dead.

05:32.709 --> 05:34.499
Get the fuck on the ground!

05:34.585 --> 05:37.125
Get the fuck down! Don't look at me!

08:48.571 --> 08:50.161
- Bishop.
- Hello, Mei.

08:51.532 --> 08:53.202
You're different.

08:53.534 --> 08:54.580
Older.

08:54.660 --> 08:57.000
Something more than that.

08:57.913 --> 09:00.962
I need time to find someone
before they find me.

09:01.042 --> 09:03.212
Then I'll be moving on.

09:03.294 --> 09:04.964
Who else is here?

09:05.046 --> 09:07.796
No one. Diving season's over.

09:07.882 --> 09:09.132
Come.

09:09.216 --> 09:10.966
Your home's waiting for you.

09:11.052 --> 09:12.722
How was your trip?

09:12.803 --> 09:14.183
It was okay.

09:16.599 --> 09:19.229
It was a busy season.

09:19.310 --> 09:22.690
But don't worry,
no one came near your home.

09:31.322 --> 09:32.660
Nothing's changed.

09:32.740 --> 09:33.950
Get some rest.

11:07.418 --> 11:09.418
Hi. How can I help you?

11:09.503 --> 11:10.763
Great, you speak English.

11:11.672 --> 11:14.762
I'm running low on first aid.
I'm staying on the boat.

11:15.926 --> 11:16.966
Sure.

11:20.556 --> 11:22.516
This is all I have.

11:23.309 --> 11:24.439
Thanks.

11:29.899 --> 11:33.649
If I don't have what you need,
I can call our supply boat.

11:33.736 --> 11:36.816
They can take you back
to Phuket to get it.

11:36.906 --> 11:40.986
No, this is great. Thanks so much.

11:41.076 --> 11:42.156
Anytime.

11:56.717 --> 12:02.057
- ...don't fucking tease me!
- Frank... help!

12:02.139 --> 12:03.269
- Help!
- Bishop!

12:04.350 --> 12:05.600
Bishop!

12:07.061 --> 12:09.561
They're fighting. It's bad.

12:14.109 --> 12:15.649
You want a piece of me?!

12:15.736 --> 12:16.776
Stay down.

12:25.246 --> 12:27.706
I've met her. She has a backbone.

12:27.790 --> 12:31.000
Women like that
get killed in these situations.

12:32.002 --> 12:33.672
Domestic squabble, Mei.

12:33.754 --> 12:35.304
Not my business.

12:37.758 --> 12:39.388
You helped me once.

12:40.261 --> 12:41.551
Help her.

12:42.805 --> 12:44.135
Or I will do it.

12:49.770 --> 12:51.020
Hold this.

13:25.973 --> 13:28.433
Frank, get the fuck away from me!

13:29.226 --> 13:30.516
Frank!

13:30.603 --> 13:31.813
Not worth it.

13:33.814 --> 13:34.824
Bitch!

13:38.819 --> 13:39.989
Let her go.

13:40.070 --> 13:41.490
Who the fuck are you?

13:41.572 --> 13:43.992
Please, help me.

13:44.908 --> 13:48.288
I said, let her go. Last chance.

13:48.370 --> 13:50.330
Let go of me, Frank.

13:50.414 --> 13:51.464
You don't want to do that.

13:52.207 --> 13:53.247
Fuck you!

14:11.727 --> 14:12.847
Is he dead?

14:19.943 --> 14:21.323
Bishop.

14:25.407 --> 14:26.407
Shit.

14:31.080 --> 14:33.830
Take her ashore. I'll deal with the boat.

14:33.916 --> 14:34.996
Okay.

15:45.028 --> 15:46.608
- Bishop.
- Where is she?

15:46.697 --> 15:48.407
Sleeping. In your bungalow.

15:57.958 --> 15:59.288
What's going on?

15:59.376 --> 16:01.956
Gina Thornton. American.

16:02.045 --> 16:03.915
- That's you, right?
- Yeah.

16:04.006 --> 16:07.176
You're the second woman
who has my picture in her phone.

16:07.468 --> 16:09.468
The first was working
for a guy called Crain.

16:09.553 --> 16:11.809
Name ring a bell?

16:11.889 --> 16:14.728
The only thing you got right was my name.

16:14.808 --> 16:16.348
The first woman was a messenger.

16:17.478 --> 16:19.648
Is that what you are?

16:19.730 --> 16:21.690
So what's the message?

16:21.774 --> 16:22.984
I already told you...

16:23.066 --> 16:24.736
Tell me about Crain.

16:24.818 --> 16:26.278
What are you supposed to do for him?

16:26.361 --> 16:27.531
Where is he?

16:32.910 --> 16:34.240
Fine. I'll talk.

16:41.710 --> 16:44.170
Look... I don't work for Crain.

16:44.254 --> 16:46.724
That's the truth. But he did send me.

16:47.007 --> 16:48.677
Where is he?

16:48.759 --> 16:50.719
- I don't know.
- Why are you here?

16:52.262 --> 16:54.309
He has something on me.

16:54.389 --> 16:55.559
I had no choice.

16:56.099 --> 16:57.139
Right.

16:57.226 --> 16:58.846
Any of his men nearby?

16:58.936 --> 17:00.476
He didn't say, I didn't ask.

17:00.562 --> 17:02.312
What about Frank?

17:02.397 --> 17:03.437
Part of the setup.

17:03.524 --> 17:05.779
Explain.

17:05.858 --> 17:09.858
He was supposed to get mean,
I escape to this island.

17:09.946 --> 17:11.487
It wasn't meant to be real.

17:11.573 --> 17:13.913
But then Frank got drunk and attacked me.

17:14.034 --> 17:16.204
Crain wanted me to look like a victim.

17:16.286 --> 17:17.826
And get next to me?

17:18.664 --> 17:20.210
Yeah.

17:20.290 --> 17:22.378
But Frank took his part too far.

17:22.459 --> 17:25.089
So we meet. What next?

17:25.170 --> 17:27.880
I use the cell and call
the pre-programmed number.

17:27.964 --> 17:30.965
Let it ring once.
After that, I don't know.

17:31.051 --> 17:34.141
My new girl gets kidnapped is what.

17:34.221 --> 17:35.559
What?

17:35.639 --> 17:37.429
The thought didn't cross your mind?

17:42.145 --> 17:45.355
Okay, so you fall for me,
and Crain thinks he has leverage on you.

17:45.440 --> 17:46.940
Why?

17:47.067 --> 17:49.487
Well, to force me to do something
I don't want to do.

17:49.570 --> 17:51.570
What is it that you do?

17:52.948 --> 17:55.408
I'll make the call, not you.
I choose when they come.

17:55.492 --> 17:57.492
Then I'll take Crain out.

17:57.578 --> 18:00.998
No. I'm not going to help you kill anyone.

18:01.081 --> 18:02.920
Do you really believe that Crain

18:03.000 --> 18:05.540
lets the people he blackmails
into helping him, live?

18:07.921 --> 18:10.551
I've spent my whole life
setting people up to die.

18:11.967 --> 18:13.427
I can set you up to live.

18:36.575 --> 18:39.285
My father was a doctor
of Eastern medicine.

18:39.369 --> 18:40.749
He was a healer.

18:41.997 --> 18:43.917
Bishop used to study with him.

18:45.208 --> 18:46.418
To learn how to heal?

18:47.336 --> 18:49.046
A man like him?

18:49.129 --> 18:50.509
I thought so, too.

18:52.674 --> 18:55.094
But my father understood

18:55.177 --> 19:00.927
that those who have been hurt the most
often have the greatest ability to heal.

19:55.737 --> 19:57.067
Eighteen months ago,

19:57.197 --> 20:00.987
special military operative, Gina Thornton,
left the war zone in Afghanistan

20:01.076 --> 20:04.076
to offer humanitarian
assistance in Cambodia.

20:04.204 --> 20:07.124
After my last deployment,
I just needed a change.

20:07.207 --> 20:10.957
Too many innocent people
getting caught in the line of fire.

20:11.044 --> 20:13.214
Rules of engagement
made it impossible to prevent.

20:15.799 --> 20:20.599
And then, you know,
when I came to Phnom Penh, I, uh,

20:20.679 --> 20:23.519
I don't know, it just felt right here.

20:24.474 --> 20:29.234
And, um, I felt like I can maybe
do something good with my life.

20:46.496 --> 20:48.786
I can't afford any surprises.

20:48.874 --> 20:50.544
Need to know what Crain has on you.

20:57.007 --> 21:01.047
I run a shelter for victims
of human trafficking in Cambodia.

21:01.136 --> 21:05.176
There's always been an issue or two,
but I've managed to handle it.

21:06.600 --> 21:12.440
A few weeks ago...
one of my staff members was kidnapped.

21:13.899 --> 21:17.939
Two days later, she was thrown off a truck
at my front door.

21:18.028 --> 21:20.948
Beaten. Died within an hour.

21:23.075 --> 21:27.615
Crain sent this asshole, Jeremy,
who said it was just a taste

21:27.704 --> 21:30.584
of what he'd do
to everyone at the shelter.

21:30.665 --> 21:33.875
Including the children.

21:33.960 --> 21:38.170
They are my weakness.
All the leverage Crain needed.

21:40.050 --> 21:46.140
So, you see, I didn't have a choice.
I had to do what Crain wanted me to.

23:00.714 --> 23:02.174
- What are you doing?
- Hold my hand.

23:02.257 --> 23:04.297
It's for Crain's people.

23:04.384 --> 23:05.804
They're watching.

23:05.886 --> 23:06.886
Where?

23:08.263 --> 23:10.310
Two men in the Zodiac.

23:10.390 --> 23:11.600
Out in the ocean.

23:23.069 --> 23:24.989
There you are. Come on, you two.

23:25.071 --> 23:26.910
You're gonna miss the best part.

23:26.990 --> 23:28.830
Give me your hands.

23:35.540 --> 23:36.670
Hold this, please.

23:36.750 --> 23:38.670
- We can just get a drink and...
- No, you will not.

23:38.752 --> 23:40.048
- You will stay right there.
- Mei...

23:40.128 --> 23:42.588
- Thank you very much.
- What are you doing?

23:42.672 --> 23:45.592
All couples have to be tied together.

23:45.675 --> 23:47.425
But we're not a couple.

23:48.261 --> 23:50.221
You sure looked like it on the beach.

23:56.811 --> 24:00.321
So... do you go to weddings... a lot?

24:03.818 --> 24:06.148
Not my idea of a good time.

24:06.488 --> 24:08.028
Me neither.

24:08.114 --> 24:09.164
Here.

24:10.283 --> 24:12.243
We supposed to drink this?

24:12.327 --> 24:14.367
No. Put your fingertips in it

24:14.454 --> 24:18.834
and place three dots
on each other's foreheads for good luck.

24:18.917 --> 24:21.167
- Enjoy.
- I could use some good luck.

24:21.253 --> 24:22.463
"Enjoy"?

24:33.515 --> 24:35.225
Okay, my turn.

24:35.308 --> 24:36.978
Come on, let's just get a drink.
Leave that.

24:37.060 --> 24:39.020
All right. One second.

24:42.774 --> 24:44.364
This is a great look for you.

24:58.665 --> 24:59.785
You missed a spot.

25:03.962 --> 25:05.962
It's really kind of stuck.

25:06.631 --> 25:09.051
Okay, okay.

25:09.134 --> 25:11.514
Next time, use your shoe.

25:20.812 --> 25:22.402
I love this song.

25:24.524 --> 25:26.534
- This a Thai song?
- Yeah.

25:27.152 --> 25:28.572
It's so good.

25:33.116 --> 25:34.236
Wanna dance?

25:37.537 --> 25:39.247
No, don't worry.

25:39.331 --> 25:41.501
I don't... I don't want to dance with you.

25:41.583 --> 25:43.171
What, you think I'm a bad dancer?

25:43.251 --> 25:46.051
- You look like you're a terrible dancer.
- Fine.

26:13.990 --> 26:15.120
Hey.

26:17.786 --> 26:23.666
I... I just wanted to thank you
for everything.

26:24.417 --> 26:25.587
Everything?

26:31.716 --> 26:38.056
And I wanted to apologize for...
getting you into this mess.

26:41.017 --> 26:45.307
Those kids are everything to me.

26:45.939 --> 26:50.239
If they get trafficked or... or killed...

26:53.071 --> 26:54.741
I couldn't bear it.

26:56.783 --> 26:58.283
I understand.

27:03.873 --> 27:05.083
I was an orphan, too.

27:08.128 --> 27:09.918
I was sold to an East End gangster

27:10.004 --> 27:12.634
who specialized
in training child soldiers.

27:12.715 --> 27:14.125
Crain was there, too.

27:15.635 --> 27:17.215
What happened?

27:19.013 --> 27:20.643
I escaped, he didn't.

27:23.143 --> 27:25.603
No doubt they blamed him.

27:25.687 --> 27:27.267
Took it out in blood.

27:28.898 --> 27:31.278
So now he blames you.

27:32.652 --> 27:34.492
Yeah, this is his payback.

27:37.490 --> 27:40.330
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

27:41.286 --> 27:42.696
It's not your fault.

29:23.221 --> 29:24.601
What are we gonna do?

29:31.479 --> 29:32.609
I worked it out.

29:32.689 --> 29:36.439
Supply boat from the back side
of the island, out of view.

29:36.526 --> 29:38.396
By tomorrow night,
you'll be out of danger.

29:38.486 --> 29:40.106
Your kids, too.

29:40.196 --> 29:41.906
It's all arranged.

29:41.990 --> 29:44.078
What about Crain?

29:44.158 --> 29:46.328
I'm not doing his three kills.

29:48.121 --> 29:52.791
Once you're safe,
there's only going to be one. Him.

29:52.875 --> 29:54.875
But they'll never let you near him.

29:56.212 --> 29:58.302
They'll never know I was there.

30:02.677 --> 30:05.177
I want you to hold on to something for me.

30:05.263 --> 30:06.813
Until I come back.

30:11.019 --> 30:12.559
My father gave this to me.

30:13.980 --> 30:15.940
It's the only memory I have of him.

30:20.862 --> 30:22.452
I'll keep it safe.

30:58.858 --> 31:00.188
That's Crain's guy.

31:00.860 --> 31:02.240
Look at me.

31:02.320 --> 31:05.200
Remember, I'll make sure to get you home.

31:05.281 --> 31:06.371
Trust me.

31:27.970 --> 31:29.180
Bishop!

31:30.390 --> 31:31.770
Bishop!

31:31.891 --> 31:34.351
Help!

31:37.897 --> 31:39.517
Bishop!

31:39.607 --> 31:40.977
Bishop!

31:48.908 --> 31:52.288
Mr. Crain, I have him right here.

31:54.914 --> 31:57.044
Tell me how to find you face-to-face.

32:30.825 --> 32:31.985
Are we done?

32:32.952 --> 32:34.292
Follow me.

32:45.965 --> 32:47.175
Sit down.

32:53.347 --> 32:54.967
Please, don't move.

32:55.099 --> 32:57.639
I'd listen to her if I were you, Arthur.

32:58.978 --> 33:00.728
No need for guards or guns

33:00.813 --> 33:03.233
when the man you want's
sitting on a pound of Semtex.

33:03.316 --> 33:05.276
How did you find me, Riah?

33:05.359 --> 33:07.819
What, no, "Hello.
Nice to see you after all these years"?

33:10.114 --> 33:13.204
But then, you always were one
for getting down to business.

33:13.284 --> 33:15.874
How did I find you?

33:15.995 --> 33:17.705
You should know better
than anyone, Arthur,

33:17.788 --> 33:19.748
there's no privacy anymore.

33:19.832 --> 33:21.629
Not with wonderful things like

33:21.709 --> 33:24.799
facial recognition and satellite tracking.

33:26.088 --> 33:29.178
I'm going to give you something
I never give anyone;

33:29.258 --> 33:31.218
Chance to walk away.

33:31.302 --> 33:33.892
Give me the girl and walk away.

33:35.014 --> 33:38.062
I see you've developed
a sense of humor over the years.

33:38.142 --> 33:42.692
But if it's all the same: No.
I need you. You're the best.

33:45.566 --> 33:46.686
Open it.

33:49.278 --> 33:51.908
I need you to eliminate three people.

33:52.031 --> 33:53.369
And this is the first.

33:53.449 --> 33:56.659
His name is Krill.
Mass-murderer and warlord.

33:56.744 --> 34:00.624
He's also the highest-profile
arms dealer in Africa.

34:00.706 --> 34:03.786
He's imprisoned
on Penjara Kaedah in Malaysia.

34:03.876 --> 34:06.296
His imprisonment is what keeps him secure.

34:06.379 --> 34:09.299
It's impossible for his enemies
to get to him.

34:09.382 --> 34:11.931
And this?

34:12.051 --> 34:14.098
It's important that you
swallow it only after the kill,

34:14.178 --> 34:17.348
or the fuel cell will degrade
and we'll never find you.

34:17.431 --> 34:18.931
Where's Gina?

34:19.058 --> 34:22.938
Do the three kills, Arthur.
Get the girl back.

34:23.062 --> 34:26.319
Even if you don't love her,
you at least owe her, no?

34:26.399 --> 34:28.859
I mean, she's in this shit because of you.

34:28.943 --> 34:31.112
How do I know you'll keep her alive?

34:31.195 --> 34:34.315
Finish your kill, get a video call.

34:34.407 --> 34:37.157
After the last one, you'll receive
instructions where to find her.

34:37.243 --> 34:39.040
And your word's good, is it?

34:39.120 --> 34:42.040
Good heavens, absolutely not.

34:42.123 --> 34:45.713
But I do have a very keen
sense of self-preservation.

34:45.793 --> 34:49.213
I know that cheating you
will only make me your target.

34:49.297 --> 34:52.087
And since that concludes
our business for the moment,

34:53.384 --> 34:56.724
I wish you bonne chance.

35:28.669 --> 35:30.669
Let's get moving, sweetheart, come on.

35:32.673 --> 35:33.973
Come on, let's go.

35:45.561 --> 35:48.271
The prison is 70 miles out to sea,

35:48.356 --> 35:52.146
set atop cliffs more than 100 meters high

35:52.234 --> 35:55.034
and surrounded by shark-infested waters.

35:55.154 --> 35:59.578
So, basically impossible to get in,
and nobody has ever gotten out.

35:59.658 --> 36:02.368
It will be even harder to get your man.

36:02.453 --> 36:06.373
He's surrounded at all times
by his team of loyal soldiers.

36:06.916 --> 36:10.166
Getting him alone
will be your main challenge.

36:50.584 --> 36:52.504
Shark repellent. Yes, sir.

36:56.382 --> 36:57.762
Thank you.

37:07.309 --> 37:09.398
It's powerful stuff.

37:09.478 --> 37:10.978
Hope you know what you're doing.

38:39.527 --> 38:41.237
- Hey!
- Hey, hey, hey, you!

38:41.320 --> 38:43.990
What? What? What do you want, huh?

38:44.073 --> 38:46.370
- Hey, stop.
- Yeah, right.

38:46.450 --> 38:48.200
- Stop.
- Fuck you.

38:59.255 --> 39:01.005
Martin Basman, you are under arrest.

39:50.806 --> 39:52.176
Thank you.

40:22.463 --> 40:27.383
Bishop, remember,
it has to look like an accident.

40:27.468 --> 40:32.258
If he dies with a knife in his back,
no one will be there to pick you up.

40:35.267 --> 40:37.017
Good luck.

41:01.126 --> 41:03.626
- Who the hell is that?
- Krill.

41:03.712 --> 41:10.342
He was an executioner for people like
Charles Taylor and the Sudanese militia.

41:10.469 --> 41:13.309
People say he ate
the hearts of his victims.

41:15.683 --> 41:17.983
Some have relatives who want revenge.

41:19.603 --> 41:21.733
Like that guy over there.

41:21.814 --> 41:24.820
He used to be Krill's best assassin.

41:24.900 --> 41:27.990
Now all he wants to do is kill him.

41:28.070 --> 41:32.070
But he has his bodyguards
constantly protecting him.

43:14.927 --> 43:17.047
You are a good man.

43:17.930 --> 43:19.720
Why don't you join us for dinner?

43:22.392 --> 43:24.312
I'm not sure I like the company.

43:27.272 --> 43:29.442
Then they are not invited.

44:00.681 --> 44:03.431
Hey. Come, come.

44:03.517 --> 44:05.307
Come in, my friend.

44:07.271 --> 44:11.941
There are six murders
and 23 stabbings every week

44:13.527 --> 44:15.397
in this shithole.

44:15.487 --> 44:17.447
Most of them pointed at me.

44:18.991 --> 44:22.791
That guy you stopped,
he used to work for me.

44:25.122 --> 44:27.582
Maybe he is still upset
that I killed his brother.

44:30.919 --> 44:36.219
Loyalty is a scarce commodity
in my line of business.

44:39.136 --> 44:41.966
Oh, yes.

44:42.055 --> 44:45.265
How did you know
that he would want to kill me?

44:45.475 --> 44:46.935
I hear things.

44:47.019 --> 44:50.519
My juju tells me everything
that I need to hear.

44:51.481 --> 44:53.361
Maybe you weren't listening hard enough.

44:58.280 --> 45:00.030
Do you know who I am?

45:01.408 --> 45:02.578
Krill.

45:03.744 --> 45:05.004
You run this place.

45:05.537 --> 45:07.457
Exactly.

45:07.539 --> 45:12.959
And when I get out of this place,
I'm going to run all of Africa.

45:13.045 --> 45:15.705
There could be a job for a man like you.

45:19.343 --> 45:21.053
I already have a job.

45:21.136 --> 45:23.136
- What job?
- You.

46:35.377 --> 46:37.167
Let the man pray.

48:36.998 --> 48:38.498
Here he comes.

48:49.136 --> 48:50.346
He's right below us.

48:50.512 --> 48:52.392
Bring up the net.

49:11.158 --> 49:12.738
Nothing in the net, sir.

49:12.826 --> 49:15.826
What the fuck?

49:15.954 --> 49:17.504
Looking for someone?

49:19.374 --> 49:20.964
I want my call.

49:25.046 --> 49:28.086
Well, Bishop survived.

49:36.766 --> 49:37.846
Hello, Arthur.

49:37.976 --> 49:39.096
Happy now?

49:39.186 --> 49:41.186
Nice work on Krill.

49:41.271 --> 49:43.231
Prison food'll kill you.

49:44.316 --> 49:45.936
Put Gina on.

49:46.026 --> 49:47.526
Here's your boyfriend.

49:47.611 --> 49:48.990
Hi.

49:49.070 --> 49:50.360
How are you holding up?

49:50.447 --> 49:52.027
I'm okay.

49:52.115 --> 49:56.325
Crain wanted me to let you know that
you have 36 hours

49:56.411 --> 50:00.041
to eliminate the next target,
or they will eliminate me.

50:00.999 --> 50:02.879
That won't happen.

50:03.001 --> 50:05.590
Okay, this is all very sweet, Arthur.

50:05.670 --> 50:07.630
But you heard what she said.

50:07.714 --> 50:09.674
You need to pick up the pace.

50:09.758 --> 50:12.508
This is your next kill. Adrian Cook.

50:33.156 --> 50:35.196
Did Bishop tell you where he got this?

50:39.079 --> 50:40.869
It belonged to his father.

50:42.749 --> 50:45.789
I never saw him take it off. Never.

50:47.045 --> 50:48.835
You know, I wasn't sure there was anything

50:48.922 --> 50:50.760
in the world that could break Arthur,

50:50.840 --> 50:54.300
until I saw you wearing this watch.

50:54.386 --> 50:56.716
Now I know he'll do anything for you.

51:17.075 --> 51:20.995
In the heart of downtown Sydney,
atop a 58-story high-rise,

51:21.079 --> 51:24.169
is the penthouse suite
owned by Adrian Cook,

51:24.249 --> 51:26.709
the mining and minerals billionaire.

51:26.793 --> 51:28.548
Few people know that he originally

51:28.628 --> 51:33.718
made his fortune in human trafficking,
specializing in underage sex workers.

51:33.800 --> 51:36.720
He has plenty of manpower
protecting him, of course.

51:36.803 --> 51:38.643
But that's the least of it.

51:41.933 --> 51:43.393
There you go.

51:43.476 --> 51:46.396
The Sydney Opera House
and the Harbour Bridge.

51:52.736 --> 51:55.696
Cook's paranoia
is only trumped by his ego.

51:55.780 --> 51:58.160
Exhibit A. His cantilever pool.

52:01.328 --> 52:05.578
The walls and floors are all concrete,
three-feet thick.

52:08.126 --> 52:11.246
Every door is made
of six-inch nickel chromium steel.

52:11.338 --> 52:13.918
That's like 12 armor plates.

52:14.007 --> 52:16.717
And the biometric sensors
and retina readers at the access points

52:16.801 --> 52:18.221
are impossible to hack.

52:19.554 --> 52:21.224
It's a fortress in the sky.

52:50.293 --> 52:53.763
Mr. Clark. Good to meet you. Shall we?

52:55.256 --> 53:00.256
So each apartment has over 300
square meters of premium living space.

53:00.345 --> 53:03.595
But this one gets the Sydney sunset.

53:05.183 --> 53:08.103
The specifications
are all in the brochure.

53:08.186 --> 53:11.016
Let me show you the detailed floor plan.

53:11.106 --> 53:15.436
We've got Italian tiles
running completely across here.

53:17.237 --> 53:19.607
- Oh, excuse me.
- Sure.

53:19.697 --> 53:22.577
Hello? Samantha Burns.

53:23.785 --> 53:25.115
Hello?

53:30.208 --> 53:31.958
Sorry about that. So, where were we?

53:32.043 --> 53:33.963
You were about to tell me
about the floor plans.

53:34.045 --> 53:35.205
Oh, yes.

54:20.466 --> 54:23.426
But we're not dumping on the reef.

54:23.511 --> 54:25.681
"Near" is not on.

54:25.763 --> 54:28.563
And if the tree-huggers
do kick up, well, then...

54:29.267 --> 54:30.887
Yeah. That's right.

54:30.977 --> 54:34.017
Now I've gotta go. Now I've gotta go.

57:53.096 --> 57:54.926
Everyone, evacuate!

57:57.517 --> 57:59.347
Call the police!

58:08.194 --> 58:09.741
Billionaire Adrian Cook

58:09.821 --> 58:12.491
plunged 76 floors
to his death this morning,

58:12.573 --> 58:16.203
when the glass pool
of his Sydney penthouse collapsed.

58:16.285 --> 58:17.445
Although authorities...

58:17.537 --> 58:19.537
Give him his call.

58:19.831 --> 58:21.419
Okay.

58:21.499 --> 58:23.289
...described his death
as a tragic accident,

58:23.376 --> 58:25.626
effectively ruling out foul play.

58:41.936 --> 58:44.186
- Ready.
- Go ahead.

58:50.903 --> 58:55.033
Bishop, your watch stopped.

58:56.284 --> 58:57.704
I think it's a sign.

58:59.120 --> 59:00.830
Maybe it just needs cleaning.

59:01.539 --> 59:04.129
No. Look closer.

59:08.379 --> 59:09.419
Son of a bitch!

59:29.025 --> 59:30.065
All right?

59:30.151 --> 59:31.901
This the harbor master's office?

59:31.986 --> 59:33.696
Yeah, it is. How may I assist you?

59:33.779 --> 59:36.199
My name is Tom Silva.

59:36.282 --> 59:40.242
Some bastard in a bloody gray yacht
just scraped my vessel.

59:40.328 --> 59:42.118
I have the hull number,

59:42.205 --> 59:44.915
but my insurance
needs the owner's details.

59:46.000 --> 59:48.250
Okay, mate. Go ahead.

59:48.336 --> 59:53.376
WRX 489-674-2239.

59:53.466 --> 59:56.046
Okay. Give me one moment.

59:56.135 --> 59:59.755
The vessel's berth is in
Sydney Harbour on Pier 7.

59:59.847 --> 01:00:02.427
That's about it.

01:00:02.517 --> 01:00:04.307
If you need any further details...

01:00:21.202 --> 01:00:23.912
The boat you're looking for is gone, mate.

01:00:24.872 --> 01:00:27.920
It's a big one, too.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.500
Head out of the harbor.
It couldn't have gone far.

01:00:31.629 --> 01:00:33.799
It's your money, boss.

01:00:50.731 --> 01:00:52.281
There! East!

01:00:54.694 --> 01:00:57.414
Come out of the sun, so he can't see you.

01:00:58.072 --> 01:01:01.242
Drop it down to 60 feet
and hold it steady.

01:02:43.177 --> 01:02:45.177
Got it. I'm heading aft deck.

01:02:50.184 --> 01:02:52.104
Hey!

01:03:37.565 --> 01:03:38.975
Take him out!

01:03:40.901 --> 01:03:42.611
Go.

01:03:55.249 --> 01:03:56.329
Go, go!

01:04:14.059 --> 01:04:15.689
Bishop!

01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:46.590
You know your problem, Bishop?
You just can't help yourself.

01:04:46.675 --> 01:04:48.505
That's how I knew you'd come back for her.

01:04:49.929 --> 01:04:51.809
That's your weakness.

01:04:51.889 --> 01:04:54.639
Now do the third kill, or the girl's dead.

01:04:56.477 --> 01:04:59.357
Take him down below.
And give him a proper sendoff.

01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:58.660
Bishop, if you pull
another stunt like that,

01:05:58.747 --> 01:06:03.087
our deal is off, and you'll never
see your little girlfriend again.

01:06:07.256 --> 01:06:10.426
Now, playtime's over.

01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:17.980
Go to the port town of Varna,
on the Black Sea.

01:06:19.393 --> 01:06:21.733
That's where you'll find your third kill.

01:06:23.772 --> 01:06:28.322
His name is Max Adams,
a wealthy American arms dealer.

01:06:35.743 --> 01:06:39.413
On the north side of Varna,
you'll find a truly vulgar memorial

01:06:39.496 --> 01:06:41.246
to Bulgarian communism...

01:06:41.874 --> 01:06:44.004
Adams spent a fortune restoring it

01:06:44.084 --> 01:06:47.174
and putting in the most
comprehensive security system.

01:06:56.472 --> 01:06:59.352
But the interesting part
is what you don't see.

01:07:00.643 --> 01:07:03.193
Hidden in the mountainside
below is the sub pen.

01:07:04.104 --> 01:07:08.194
Adams stocks his U-boats with
intercontinental ballistic missiles.

01:07:10.277 --> 01:07:14.947
Nobody gets in or out.
Many have died trying.

01:07:15.032 --> 01:07:20.202
So, needless to say, this will be
the hardest site to penetrate by far.

01:07:20.287 --> 01:07:24.117
On top of all that, Krill and Cook's
deaths may have Adams on the defense.

01:07:29.797 --> 01:07:31.667
You have 24 hours.

01:07:47.773 --> 01:07:50.693
You're using me
to take out the competition.

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.441
We will dispatch helicopter.

01:10:04.076 --> 01:10:05.576
Once you reach the compound,

01:10:05.661 --> 01:10:08.251
you'll have to deal with
several layers of security.

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:21.698
The building has
its own power system, oxygen supply,

01:11:21.778 --> 01:11:24.068
and a state-of-the-art panic room.

01:11:26.408 --> 01:11:27.908
Good luck, Arthur.

01:11:55.103 --> 01:11:57.193
Open the goddamn door.

01:11:57.314 --> 01:11:58.904
Please?

01:12:12.579 --> 01:12:13.909
Call me when you know something.

01:12:21.088 --> 01:12:23.798
No sign of the intruder, Mr. Adams.

01:12:23.882 --> 01:12:28.012
That's because he's sitting right in front
of me here in the safe room, jackoff.

01:12:29.137 --> 01:12:33.727
Magnificent.
Even if it is all stolen and looted.

01:12:33.809 --> 01:12:35.729
Cubo-futurist totalitarianism.

01:12:35.811 --> 01:12:40.110
Of course it's magnificent.
Like... dinosaur bones.

01:12:40.190 --> 01:12:41.360
It's ugly.

01:12:43.193 --> 01:12:44.653
Who the fuck are you?

01:12:44.736 --> 01:12:46.236
I'm here to talk.

01:12:46.363 --> 01:12:48.033
Lose your cell phone?

01:12:48.115 --> 01:12:50.695
I should've hired those guys from Houston.

01:12:50.784 --> 01:12:52.494
All right, what is it
that you want to talk about?

01:12:52.577 --> 01:12:55.247
I want to help you avoid an accident.

01:12:55.372 --> 01:12:58.332
Krill, Cook, that was you.

01:12:58.417 --> 01:13:01.667
I warned those guys that one day Crain
would come after all of us.

01:13:01.753 --> 01:13:03.263
Cappuccino? Espresso?

01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:05.130
Espresso. No sugar.

01:13:07.759 --> 01:13:11.929
Krill was a warlord, and also the
number-one arms dealer in Africa.

01:13:12.014 --> 01:13:15.729
Cook used his mining empire as a cover
to control the Asian franchise.

01:13:15.809 --> 01:13:18.769
You got Europe, most of South America.

01:13:18.854 --> 01:13:22.069
North America, too, if you count Mexicans.

01:13:22.149 --> 01:13:23.649
That didn't leave much for Crain.

01:13:24.484 --> 01:13:26.284
So I have a deal for you.

01:13:27.029 --> 01:13:30.369
Well, I'm a dealer.

01:13:30.449 --> 01:13:31.829
We can talk about it.

01:13:39.666 --> 01:13:41.876
I've been called
a lot of ugly names over the years,

01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:44.960
Communist, socialist, racist, fascist...

01:13:45.047 --> 01:13:47.127
None of which is true, of course.

01:13:47.215 --> 01:13:48.215
Well...

01:13:49.676 --> 01:13:51.636
I'm certainly not a communist.

01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:54.430
You just admire their architecture.

01:13:54.514 --> 01:13:56.061
I believe in fair play.

01:13:56.141 --> 01:14:00.771
I saw the David and Goliath story
play out on the frontlines of Vietnam.

01:14:00.854 --> 01:14:04.611
Soviets in Afghanistan.
Ethnic cleansing in Bosnia.

01:14:04.691 --> 01:14:06.530
Chemical weapons on the Kurds.

01:14:06.610 --> 01:14:09.700
The little guy is always
gonna need a slingshot,

01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:11.910
and somebody's always gonna pay for it.

01:14:13.533 --> 01:14:15.333
An arms dealer with a moral clause.

01:14:16.745 --> 01:14:21.165
Let's talk about Crain.
We both need him gone.

01:14:21.249 --> 01:14:24.589
The question is, how do we accomplish
that? He's got an army around him.

01:14:24.669 --> 01:14:28.219
We need something tempting enough so
that Crain uses his men to go after it.

01:14:29.257 --> 01:14:33.347
- What do you have in mind?
- Your submarine pen.

01:14:33.470 --> 01:14:37.220
Have them search for weapons, treasure...

01:14:37.307 --> 01:14:38.477
Your corpse.

01:14:39.267 --> 01:14:40.477
What?

01:14:41.937 --> 01:14:43.517
You'll have to die.

01:14:43.605 --> 01:14:45.315
Well, that's easy.

01:14:45.399 --> 01:14:47.479
Although it will cost
a tremendous amount of money.

01:14:48.735 --> 01:14:50.105
You can afford it.

01:15:02.916 --> 01:15:04.376
Are the boats all secured?

01:15:04.501 --> 01:15:06.089
Yes, sir.

01:15:06.169 --> 01:15:07.999
- Batteries charged?
- Yes, sir.

01:15:08.088 --> 01:15:10.298
- Fully provisioned?
- Yes, sir.

01:15:10.382 --> 01:15:12.382
You get those Russian girls
in here last night for the crew?

01:15:12.509 --> 01:15:13.509
Yes, sir.

01:15:13.593 --> 01:15:15.803
Well, looks like we're ready to go.

01:15:23.895 --> 01:15:25.265
Stay here.

01:15:55.969 --> 01:15:58.809
There was an explosion,
and Mr. Adams fell into the water.

01:15:58.889 --> 01:16:02.729
His security, they tried to reach him,
but the rocks came down,

01:16:02.809 --> 01:16:06.019
and he was buried under the water. Gone.

01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:13.570
Oh, my God.

01:16:15.113 --> 01:16:20.122
I never imagined that dying would be
so goddamn invigorating!

01:16:20.202 --> 01:16:21.912
Stay out of sight for two days.

01:16:21.995 --> 01:16:24.325
After that,
you can invigorate all you want.

01:16:47.521 --> 01:16:49.731
You calling for the driver?

01:16:49.814 --> 01:16:52.070
Making dinner reservations?

01:16:52.150 --> 01:16:53.780
Checking in with Mom?

01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:55.860
I'm calling Crain
to make sure he takes the bait.

01:17:04.037 --> 01:17:06.497
You do know how to put on a show.

01:17:06.623 --> 01:17:08.253
There's a pier a few miles north of Varna.

01:17:08.333 --> 01:17:10.503
Be there tomorrow with the girl.

01:17:10.627 --> 01:17:12.707
Not until I see Adams' body.

01:17:12.796 --> 01:17:16.126
You'll find him
with his most prized possessions.

01:17:16.216 --> 01:17:17.756
In his submarine pen.

01:17:25.058 --> 01:17:28.438
Get over there. Find Adams' body.

01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:31.150
Secure everything inside the pen.

01:17:31.231 --> 01:17:33.481
And... what about Bishop?

01:17:34.442 --> 01:17:35.742
Kill him.

01:18:49.184 --> 01:18:52.154
Jeremy, point the camera forward,
so I can see.

01:19:11.748 --> 01:19:13.248
All right. Let's go. Fan out.

01:19:29.974 --> 01:19:31.314
Where the hell is Bishop?

01:19:34.688 --> 01:19:36.768
Sir, it's clear.

01:19:36.856 --> 01:19:38.106
Two-one clear.

01:19:43.947 --> 01:19:45.777
- Contact right rear.
- Take cover!

01:19:55.875 --> 01:19:57.495
Take cover! Take cover!

01:20:27.866 --> 01:20:29.026
Go, go, go!

01:20:54.851 --> 01:20:56.391
Motherfucker!

01:21:12.285 --> 01:21:13.495
Anything?

01:21:13.578 --> 01:21:15.748
No sign of him, Mr. Crain.

01:21:15.872 --> 01:21:21.292
Stay sharp. Bishop's coming.
You can count on it.

01:21:27.258 --> 01:21:29.928
- What's going on?
- Your boyfriend's coming to die.

01:21:31.054 --> 01:21:33.934
And you're the bait. Move!

01:22:04.337 --> 01:22:05.837
Come on, Bishop.

01:22:07.757 --> 01:22:09.547
I know you're not going to let her die.

01:22:11.636 --> 01:22:13.256
Clear.

01:22:18.268 --> 01:22:19.518
Nothing here.

01:22:27.861 --> 01:22:29.241
Yeah, we're clear.

01:22:51.885 --> 01:22:53.085
Bring her to the bridge.

01:23:08.359 --> 01:23:09.489
Let's move.

01:26:05.453 --> 01:26:08.293
Let's go. We have three minutes
before it blows.

01:26:18.174 --> 01:26:20.014
Gina. You okay?

01:26:20.927 --> 01:26:22.007
I'll be fine.

01:26:24.764 --> 01:26:27.604
Let me see. Oh, shit.

01:26:28.101 --> 01:26:30.061
I saw Crain doing something
on the console.

01:26:32.939 --> 01:26:33.979
What's going on?

01:26:34.065 --> 01:26:35.725
Crain is trying to kill us.

01:26:36.192 --> 01:26:37.612
Let's go.

01:26:38.444 --> 01:26:40.033
Move this shit on the boat, now!

01:26:40.113 --> 01:26:41.533
Yes, sir.

01:26:43.741 --> 01:26:45.661
- What is this?
- Just get in.

01:26:47.703 --> 01:26:49.542
Wait. What are you doing?

01:26:49.622 --> 01:26:50.918
Making sure you live.

01:26:50.998 --> 01:26:54.088
No! Come with me! Bishop!

01:26:55.336 --> 01:26:57.086
- There he is!
- Bishop!

01:27:05.012 --> 01:27:06.309
Find him. Now!

01:27:06.389 --> 01:27:08.139
- ...move!
- Fletcher!

01:27:09.058 --> 01:27:10.598
Let's get going.

01:28:24.550 --> 01:28:26.260
You never asked why.

01:28:26.344 --> 01:28:28.184
I know why.

01:28:28.304 --> 01:28:30.144
'Cause I got out, and you didn't.

01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:32.640
And here we are again.

01:28:32.725 --> 01:28:36.685
You deserted me.
It's time you paid for that.

01:28:36.771 --> 01:28:38.151
No chance.

01:28:39.732 --> 01:28:41.322
You're gonna get your third kill.

01:28:43.402 --> 01:28:46.162
But this one won't look like an accident.

01:29:38.082 --> 01:29:40.382
You're a dead man, Bishop.

01:29:43.921 --> 01:29:46.969
You might get off the boat,
but you'll never swim far enough away

01:29:47.049 --> 01:29:48.219
before she blows.

01:29:49.218 --> 01:29:50.678
Who said I was swimming?

01:29:57.476 --> 01:29:58.846
Bishop!

01:30:02.690 --> 01:30:04.400
Bishop!

01:30:07.278 --> 01:30:08.948
Bishop!

01:30:35.014 --> 01:30:36.314
Hey!

01:30:37.767 --> 01:30:39.187
Hey!

01:31:03.876 --> 01:31:05.916
Were there any survivors?

01:31:07.630 --> 01:31:08.920
No.

01:31:24.355 --> 01:31:26.355
So Bishop never made it.

01:31:26.482 --> 01:31:28.112
Even legends die.

01:31:49.380 --> 01:31:53.720
Dear Mei. I'm back
in Cambodia with the kids.

01:31:53.801 --> 01:31:55.801
The water filter's working.

01:31:55.886 --> 01:31:58.556
Thank you so much for your generous gift.

01:31:58.639 --> 01:32:00.469
You have to come here someday.

01:32:00.558 --> 01:32:03.558
I think you'd like it a lot.

01:32:03.644 --> 01:32:08.484
Bishop would have loved it.
See you soon. I hope.

01:32:08.566 --> 01:32:11.526
Lots of love, Gina.

01:33:40.991 --> 01:33:42.241
Clever son of a bitch.

01:34:01.845 --> 01:34:03.595
Sneaky bastard.

01:34:03.681 --> 01:34:07.641
Bang. You're dead.
