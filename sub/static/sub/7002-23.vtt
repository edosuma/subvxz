WEBVTT

00:02.702 --> 00:05.103
Hey.
Oh, hi.

00:05.104 --> 00:07.038
You've been shopping.
Yep.

00:07.039 --> 00:08.940
Well, I know that's not
my mother's day present,

00:08.941 --> 00:11.977
Since you leave that
to the last possible moment.

00:11.978 --> 00:14.746
Ha! This just happens to be
your mother's day present.

00:14.747 --> 00:16.815
Oh, yeah? What is it?

00:16.816 --> 00:19.050
I don't wanna ruin
the surprise.

00:19.051 --> 00:20.485
Ruin it.

00:20.486 --> 00:22.654
No, no, no. I wanna see
your face light up
on mother's day.

00:22.655 --> 00:25.056
Why, is it a flamethrower?

00:25.057 --> 00:28.159
You're gonna love this.
Let me see. Let me see.

00:28.160 --> 00:33.698
Oh! Just what I always wanted.
A muffler.

00:33.699 --> 00:37.969
Well, if anyone could use
a muffler, it'd be you.

00:37.970 --> 00:39.504
I should've known.

00:39.505 --> 00:41.840
You and the boys
haven't given my present
a moment's thought.

00:41.841 --> 00:43.775
Yes, we have.
You have not.

00:43.776 --> 00:46.477
You're just gonna run the boys
to the nearest minimart

00:46.478 --> 00:48.479
And buy the first thing
you see.

00:48.480 --> 00:52.017
I encourage my boys
to buy quality gifts.
Yeah, right.

00:52.018 --> 00:56.655
Like this, uh, multicolored
candy necklace.

00:56.656 --> 00:59.724
This isn't just candy.
These are breath mints.

00:59.725 --> 01:04.828
Yeah. And these
priceless things here.

01:04.830 --> 01:06.765
I bought those.
Those are one of a kind.

01:06.766 --> 01:10.135
Ever wonder why, tim?

01:10.136 --> 01:12.137
A lot of women pay big bucks

01:12.138 --> 01:14.539
To look like
a rearview mirror, hon.

01:14.540 --> 01:17.709
Tim, I don't want you
to go out and buy the boys
presents to give me.

01:17.710 --> 01:20.879
I want them
to give me something
that's from their hearts.

01:20.880 --> 01:24.149
All right.
I'll get the boys together.
We'll gear up this year.

01:24.150 --> 01:27.318
We'll make may 16th
a day you never forget.

01:27.319 --> 01:29.387
Mother's day is may 9th.

01:30.856 --> 01:32.423
I know,

01:32.424 --> 01:34.959
But around here,
we celebrate may 16th.

01:34.960 --> 01:36.861
It's muffler's day.

02:46.298 --> 02:49.234
Well, what do you think?
Could we put the kids
in the middle?

02:56.408 --> 02:58.542
Guys, guys, guys,
come on. Huddle up.

02:58.543 --> 03:01.545
I want to talk to you
before your mom comes down.
Mark, you're the lookout.

03:01.546 --> 03:05.549
All right. I don't want
your mom to hear this.

03:05.550 --> 03:07.819
What did you blow up
this time?

03:07.820 --> 03:10.521
The toaster,
but she knows about that.

03:10.522 --> 03:12.090
No, no, no, no.

03:12.091 --> 03:14.959
I wanna talk about
a mother's day gift.

03:14.960 --> 03:18.329
Come on, dad. We still have
four days till we have to
buy her something.

03:18.330 --> 03:20.598
No, that's exactly my point.
She doesn't want us to do this.

03:20.599 --> 03:23.467
She wants something
from the heart, so you know
what we're gonna give her?

03:23.468 --> 03:25.703
Blood?

03:25.704 --> 03:28.139
No, ventricle breath,
not blood.

03:28.140 --> 03:30.441
When I get home from work,
we're gonna build her
something.

03:30.442 --> 03:33.544
Come on, dad.
Let's just buy her something.

03:33.545 --> 03:36.380
This is your mom
we're talking about.
I know.

03:36.381 --> 03:40.384
Do you know that you were
a very difficult birth? Hmm?

03:40.385 --> 03:42.987
Breech baby? Hmm?

03:42.988 --> 03:45.957
Elbows straight up
like grasshoppers? Hmm?

03:45.958 --> 03:48.492
176 hours of labor? Hmm?

03:48.493 --> 03:50.862
All right, dad. Ok.

03:50.863 --> 03:54.465
Hi, guys.
Here she comes!

03:56.869 --> 04:00.038
Ixnay on the giftay,
uysgays.

04:00.039 --> 04:03.875
Planning my
mother's day gift already?

04:03.876 --> 04:07.946
Gosh. I'm so impressed,
I'm not even gonna ask you
what you're buying me.

04:07.947 --> 04:11.482
We're each gonna
make you something.
Hey.

04:11.483 --> 04:14.018
You're gonna make me
something?

04:14.019 --> 04:17.387
I love that idea.
Thank you.

04:17.389 --> 04:18.890
Ok, guys, build away.

04:18.891 --> 04:20.892
Don't forget
to put your lunches
in your backpacks

04:20.892 --> 04:22.894
And brush your teeth
before you go, ok?
Bye, mom.

04:22.895 --> 04:24.395
Love you.
Have a good day.

04:24.396 --> 04:29.734
Oh, you need gas
in your car.
Oh, d'oh!

04:29.735 --> 04:31.569
Hey, way to go,
loudmouth.

04:31.570 --> 04:34.172
Now we actually
have to build
something.

04:34.173 --> 04:36.174
Nice attitude.
Come on, guys.

04:36.175 --> 04:38.376
I already took the hot rod
outta the garage.

04:38.377 --> 04:42.113
When I get home from work,
we'll turn it into
man central. Huh?

04:42.114 --> 04:44.715
Saw blades, cuts,
slivers, blisters...

04:44.716 --> 04:47.685
Ar-ar-ar-ar-oh-oh!

04:51.123 --> 04:53.124
Come on.
A little mother's day grunt?

04:53.125 --> 04:54.893
<i>(grunts)</i> I love you, mom.
You're the greatest.

04:54.894 --> 04:57.695
<i>(all grunt)</i> I love you, mom.
You're the greatest.

05:00.032 --> 05:03.534
Friends, having difficulty
removing all that gunk outta
that ugly bathroom drain?

05:03.535 --> 05:05.836
These are just
a few of the products
binford gives you

05:05.837 --> 05:09.540
To remove dirt and grease
and, in al's case,
loose beard hair.

05:14.846 --> 05:18.349
One of the most popular tools
is called the plunger.

05:18.350 --> 05:22.053
That's right. You might
wanna remind our viewers...

05:22.054 --> 05:23.554
To coat the...

05:23.555 --> 05:26.557
To coat the rim of the plug
with petroleum jelly.

05:26.558 --> 05:29.693
This will help form a tight seal
between the plunger
and the drain.

05:29.694 --> 05:34.098
Yes. Next, I'd like to
show you binford's
closet auger.

05:34.099 --> 05:37.635
Now, this particular auger
helps clear toilet clogs.

05:37.636 --> 05:39.003
<i>(plop)</i>

05:44.876 --> 05:48.779
Help me, al. I got a big one,
a freshwater hairball.

05:51.283 --> 05:53.284
And finally,
our favorite choice -

05:53.285 --> 05:55.987
The binford trap
and drain auger.

05:55.988 --> 05:59.123
Normally called
"the snake."

05:59.124 --> 06:01.192
<i>(â™ª snake-charming music)</i>

06:18.944 --> 06:21.512
Remember, folks,
if it doesn't say
"binford" on it,

06:21.513 --> 06:23.481
You won't be able
to flush it.

06:27.252 --> 06:29.854
Well, we're just about
out of time...

06:29.855 --> 06:31.356
...But before we go,

06:31.357 --> 06:33.891
I'd like to talk a little bit
about al's mother.

06:35.627 --> 06:37.295
I'd prefer you wouldn't, tim.

06:37.296 --> 06:39.297
I know, but with
mother's day coming up,

06:39.298 --> 06:41.966
I realize a lot of the time
I make fun of her on the show.

06:41.967 --> 06:45.403
Yes, you do.
My mother is frequently
the butt of your jokes.

06:51.443 --> 06:55.246
Al, you make this too easy.

06:55.247 --> 06:58.049
Well, you're always
poking fun of her cooking,

06:58.050 --> 07:00.518
Of her weight,
her love for bingo,
her son...

07:00.519 --> 07:02.853
Al, come in
for a landing, ok?

07:02.854 --> 07:04.588
Being mother's day,

07:04.589 --> 07:07.291
I thought I'd make her
a gift, kind of a -
ooh - peace offering.

07:07.292 --> 07:09.960
Really?
Lisa!

07:09.961 --> 07:12.463
Well, that was awfully
big of you.

07:12.464 --> 07:14.798
I thought maybe
for those festive
thanksgiving dinners,

07:14.799 --> 07:17.068
She might have
a nice new apron.

07:32.584 --> 07:34.985
What are you guys
building in there?

07:34.986 --> 07:36.987
Who said we were
building anything?

07:36.988 --> 07:39.390
Come on.
What are you making?

07:39.391 --> 07:41.825
Can't tell you.
Top secret.

07:41.826 --> 07:44.195
Brad, give me a hint.

07:44.196 --> 07:46.964
No hints!
Aah!

07:46.965 --> 07:49.467
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

07:49.468 --> 07:52.803
And you call yourself
a mother.

07:52.804 --> 07:54.472
Come on, son.

07:56.542 --> 07:57.841
<i>(knocks)</i>

07:57.842 --> 07:59.843
<i>(randy)</i>
what's the secret grunt?

07:59.844 --> 08:01.979
<i>(both grunt)</i>

08:01.980 --> 08:03.981
Ar!

08:05.517 --> 08:06.817
Ar.

08:09.455 --> 08:10.821
Enter.

08:12.458 --> 08:14.459
Hi, mom.
Can I have a popsicle?

08:14.460 --> 08:15.826
Sure.

08:22.601 --> 08:24.802
<i>(tim)</i>
what's the secret grunt?

08:24.803 --> 08:26.237
<i>(grunt)</i>

08:26.238 --> 08:28.239
<i>(grunt)</i>

08:28.240 --> 08:29.474
<i>(grunt)</i>

08:31.443 --> 08:34.645
Access denied.
Too much estrogen content.

08:40.885 --> 08:44.655
Ok, dad, I'm all finished.
All I need to do is let
the glue set.

08:44.656 --> 08:48.459
Great job on the little
jewelry box, son.
Thanks.

08:48.460 --> 08:52.130
Quick, and very nice.
Take a little gander
at randy's.

08:52.131 --> 08:55.666
Don't bother.
It stinks, dad.

08:55.667 --> 08:58.503
What is it?
I can't even figure it out.

08:58.504 --> 09:03.073
Well, don't rack your brain.
You might smash the pea.

09:05.144 --> 09:07.211
Guys, give it a rest, ok?

09:07.212 --> 09:09.347
Take five.

09:09.348 --> 09:11.182
Don't worry
about your brother.

09:11.183 --> 09:13.184
I think this birdhouse
is really nice.

09:13.185 --> 09:15.186
I'll help you
fix these walls.

09:15.187 --> 09:17.188
What's wrong with them?
They're up.

09:17.189 --> 09:19.190
Well, if I use
the miter box on them,

09:19.191 --> 09:21.192
I can take
all the rough edges off,

09:21.193 --> 09:23.194
And they'll fit real close
together like this.

09:23.195 --> 09:25.796
I'll just paint over 'em.
All right. If you wanna
paint over 'em...

09:25.797 --> 09:28.299
But at least we'll sand down
some of this rough stuff. Ok?

09:28.300 --> 09:30.635
Look, dad,
I'll just buy mom something.

09:30.636 --> 09:32.336
No, don't buy her something.

09:32.337 --> 09:35.640
But I don't like
doing this stuff.
Yeah, you like it.

09:35.641 --> 09:38.376
Dad, I didn't wanna do this
in the first place.

09:38.377 --> 09:42.713
Why don't I just finish it
for you?
Great.

09:42.714 --> 09:45.015
Is that all that your mother
means to you?

09:45.016 --> 09:47.285
Come on, dad.
It doesn't matter.

09:47.286 --> 09:49.987
Mom's gonna love
any piece of junk I give her.

09:49.988 --> 09:52.590
There's a nice sentiment.
Why don't you just put that
on the card?

09:52.591 --> 09:56.794
"happy mother's day, mom.
Here's some junk I know
you'll love. Randy."

10:04.903 --> 10:07.838
What are you talking about?
This is the norwegian
death hold.

10:07.839 --> 10:09.840
No, it's not.
I can still breathe.

10:09.841 --> 10:11.309
<i>(man on tv)</i>
<i>...Norwegian death hold.</i>

10:11.310 --> 10:14.144
Oh, really.
How about this?

10:14.145 --> 10:17.147
<i>Ow. That's gotta hurt.</i>
That's it!

10:20.752 --> 10:23.221
Hey, guys, knock it off.
Come on.

10:23.222 --> 10:24.722
Gosh, I liked it better

10:24.723 --> 10:26.724
When you were
out in the garage
with your father.

10:26.725 --> 10:28.726
At least you weren't trying
to kill each other.

10:28.727 --> 10:30.628
<i>(drill whines)</i>

10:30.629 --> 10:32.630
What's your father
doing out there now?

10:32.631 --> 10:36.701
He's working
on randy's project.
Hey, shut up, brad.

10:36.702 --> 10:40.238
Hey. Randy, why is your father
working on <i>your</i> project?

10:40.239 --> 10:43.207
I don't know.
Randy...

10:45.009 --> 10:47.010
Mom, I'm not good
at building things.

10:47.011 --> 10:49.113
I don't care about tools.

10:49.114 --> 10:51.982
Then why did you decide
to build me something?

10:51.983 --> 10:54.418
I didn't.
Dad said I had to.

10:54.419 --> 10:58.656
Hey, come on, guys.
Pillows on the couch.

10:58.657 --> 11:00.190
Tim, let me in.

11:00.191 --> 11:02.426
What's the secret grunt?

11:02.427 --> 11:05.596
Let me in now.

11:07.332 --> 11:09.133
Close enough.

11:12.537 --> 11:15.306
Why are you building
randy's mother's day gift?

11:15.307 --> 11:18.041
I'm not. I'm just showing him
the next step.

11:18.042 --> 11:20.077
He's not in the room, tim.

11:20.078 --> 11:22.580
All right, all right.
He wasn't concentrating
out here.

11:22.581 --> 11:25.082
Well, maybe
he's not interested
in building stuff.

11:25.083 --> 11:27.117
All my boys are interested
in building stuff.

11:27.118 --> 11:28.619
No. Randy's different.

11:28.620 --> 11:30.788
He likes performing,
ventriloquism, magic...

11:30.789 --> 11:32.423
He could build this.

11:32.424 --> 11:34.558
Tim, you're still not
getting this.

11:34.559 --> 11:36.960
I want the boys
to give me stuff

11:36.961 --> 11:40.197
That shows
<i>their</i> feelings for me.

11:40.198 --> 11:44.435
What are you gonna do
with a broomstick
and a pointy hat?

11:44.436 --> 11:47.037
I'm laughing
on the inside, tim.

11:47.038 --> 11:49.307
Now, look, I have faith
in my boys

11:49.308 --> 11:51.975
That they will pick
the perfect gift
on their own.

11:51.976 --> 11:54.478
Do you have
the same faith in me?
No.

11:54.479 --> 11:56.380
No, I told you what I want.

11:56.381 --> 11:58.382
A fine dinner
in a nice restaurant. Ok?

11:58.383 --> 12:00.351
We should go to chez pierre.

12:00.352 --> 12:03.053
I called them last week.
They were booked solid.

12:03.054 --> 12:06.390
Should've called 'em and made
reservations two months ago,
like I did.

12:09.060 --> 12:11.195
You did that?
Mm-hmm.

12:11.196 --> 12:15.132
Oh, honey.

12:16.435 --> 12:18.135
Yep. All set.

12:18.136 --> 12:21.038
Reservation for five,
mother's day gourmet feast.

12:21.039 --> 12:23.240
Mm. Is that the one

12:23.241 --> 12:26.243
With the corsage
and the champagne
and the live music?

12:26.244 --> 12:27.745
<i>Mais oui.</i>

12:29.781 --> 12:32.750
Boy, they go to a lot of effort
on this bogus holiday,
don't they?

12:38.423 --> 12:41.191
Excuse me. Did you call
mother's day a bogus holiday?

12:41.192 --> 12:43.193
Well, it's just been invented

12:43.194 --> 12:46.230
By restaurant owners
and florists.

12:46.231 --> 12:48.432
So you don't think
that women,

12:48.433 --> 12:52.269
Who go through the pain,
torment and suffering
of childbirth,

12:52.270 --> 12:53.838
Don't deserve a special day?

12:53.839 --> 12:56.741
You get a day.
It's labor day.

13:00.612 --> 13:03.347
Afternoon, wilson.
Hidy-ho, neighbor.

13:03.348 --> 13:04.948
What's with the flag?

13:04.949 --> 13:07.451
Tim, I'm commemorating
the upcoming holiday.

13:07.452 --> 13:08.786
With a flag?

13:08.787 --> 13:11.088
It's not the 4th of July,
it's mother's day.

13:11.089 --> 13:14.157
You see, tim, back in 1914,
congress passed a resolution

13:14.158 --> 13:17.160
Establishing mother's day
as an official holiday.

13:17.161 --> 13:19.930
<i>(grunts)</i> huh?

13:19.931 --> 13:23.033
It was a proclamation
calling on the public
to display the flag

13:23.034 --> 13:26.604
As a sign of love and reverence
for the mothers of our country,

13:26.605 --> 13:29.407
And it was issued
by the president
of the United States...

13:29.408 --> 13:30.674
Wilson...

13:30.675 --> 13:34.144
Absolutely right, tim.
President woodrow wilson.

13:34.145 --> 13:36.480
Well, maybe old woodrow
took credit for it,

13:36.481 --> 13:38.549
But I bet his mom
gave him the idea.

13:38.550 --> 13:39.650
Mm.

13:39.651 --> 13:41.886
<i>(woman)</i> wilson?
Over here.

13:41.887 --> 13:45.689
You have company?
Oh, my favorite kind
of company - mother.

13:45.690 --> 13:48.659
She just flew in
from the yukon.

13:48.660 --> 13:51.061
Really? I finally
get to meet your mom.
Uh-huh.

13:51.062 --> 13:54.398
Mom, I'd like you to meet
my friend and good neighbor
tim taylor.

13:54.399 --> 13:56.734
Hidy-ho, timothy.

13:58.403 --> 13:59.437
Hi.

13:59.438 --> 14:01.439
You must be
the confused one

14:01.440 --> 14:04.141
My son helps out
from time to time.

14:04.142 --> 14:08.378
Yeah. Yeah, I'm him.
Sure is good to meet you.

14:08.379 --> 14:09.547
Ho!

14:12.317 --> 14:15.786
I see where wilson gets
his good looks.

14:15.787 --> 14:18.789
Yes. I just flew her in
to help her celebrate
mother's day.

14:18.790 --> 14:20.791
We're going
down to greek town

14:20.792 --> 14:22.827
To drink ouzo
and dance the xoro.

14:22.828 --> 14:26.564
<i>(sings</i>
<i>greek dancing music)</i>

14:26.565 --> 14:29.166
Boy, you guys
really like to get down, huh?

14:29.167 --> 14:30.835
You know it, baby.

14:30.836 --> 14:33.270
You know, wilson,
that's a great idea,

14:33.271 --> 14:35.940
Flying your mom in
like that.

14:35.941 --> 14:37.942
Randy, my... My middle son,

14:37.943 --> 14:40.377
Is having trouble
thinking of something

14:40.378 --> 14:42.880
For mother's day
for-for my wife.

14:42.881 --> 14:45.382
Oh, I'm sure she'll love
anything he gives her.

14:45.383 --> 14:47.217
Mm-hmm.
That's right, tim.

14:47.218 --> 14:49.219
After all,
it was pierre corneille,

14:49.220 --> 14:51.589
The noted french playwright,
who wrote -

14:51.590 --> 14:55.158
"I am in the habit of looking
not so much to the nature
of the gift

14:55.159 --> 14:57.728
As to the spirit
in which it is given."

14:57.729 --> 14:59.396
Oh, that's beautiful, yeah.

14:59.397 --> 15:02.566
Excuse me, son.
Are you sure it was corneille?

15:02.567 --> 15:05.569
I believe it was
robert louis stevenson.

15:05.570 --> 15:08.672
Well, by golly, mom,
I think you're right.

15:08.673 --> 15:10.674
Pierre corneille wrote,

15:10.675 --> 15:14.111
"the manner of giving
is worth more than the gift."

15:14.112 --> 15:18.782
Act one, scene one
of his play <i>le menteur.</i>

15:18.783 --> 15:22.285
Oh, you do your mother proud.

15:22.286 --> 15:25.823
Oh, mom.

15:25.824 --> 15:28.058
Thanks, wilsons.

15:28.059 --> 15:30.227
I was enjoying
this quotefest,

15:30.228 --> 15:32.229
But, remember,
I'm the confused one,

15:32.230 --> 15:35.232
And I still don't know
what to tell randy
about mother's day.

15:35.233 --> 15:39.637
<i>(both)</i> hmm.
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

15:39.638 --> 15:43.306
The most important gift
you can give any mother

15:43.307 --> 15:45.142
Is to let her know

15:45.143 --> 15:47.244
She's loved
and appreciated.

15:47.245 --> 15:50.915
I couldn't have
said it better myself.

15:50.916 --> 15:53.918
Enjoy your time here.
Greek town's a lot of fun.
Oh, yeah.

15:56.021 --> 15:59.156
Anyway, today we're gonna
show you how to pour
a concrete foundation.

15:59.157 --> 16:01.592
That's right, and we'll be
mixing our cement

16:01.593 --> 16:03.794
With the binford 2000
cement mixer.

16:03.795 --> 16:06.329
That's right,
and to get a little help
with that cement mixing,

16:06.330 --> 16:08.899
We got the cement mixing pros
from k&b construction company

16:08.900 --> 16:10.901
Up there in bay city, michigan,
to join us,

16:10.902 --> 16:13.704
And I expect
a big <i>tool time</i> welcome
for dwayne, pete and rock.

16:13.705 --> 16:15.372
Come on out, guys.

16:15.373 --> 16:17.942
Hey!
Hey!

16:17.943 --> 16:20.844
<i>(cheering)</i>

16:20.845 --> 16:23.080
It's great
to have you guys here.

16:23.081 --> 16:25.883
It's always a pleasure
to be here, timmy.

16:27.385 --> 16:29.720
Why don't we get started
with that concrete?

16:29.721 --> 16:31.722
We gotta take
our footing...
Excuse me, tim.

16:31.723 --> 16:35.225
If we have just a minute,
I'd like to read a poem,

16:35.226 --> 16:38.295
A short poem
that I wrote for my mom.

16:38.296 --> 16:41.599
She'll be spending
this mother's day
up at michigan state.

16:41.600 --> 16:44.902
University?
No. Penitentiary.

16:47.839 --> 16:52.643
Pete, this is neither
the time nor the place.

16:52.644 --> 16:54.377
She was framed, tim.

16:56.114 --> 16:58.115
I think,
under the circumstances,

16:58.116 --> 17:00.350
We could drop our tools
for a couple of minutes

17:00.351 --> 17:02.519
And give a salute
to mothers anywhere,

17:02.520 --> 17:04.622
Or anywhere
they spend their time.

17:11.663 --> 17:16.333
<i>"an ode to my mother</i>

17:16.334 --> 17:17.867
That would be me.

"mother.

17:57.942 --> 17:59.376
Mother."

18:01.012 --> 18:03.480
Happy mother's day, mom!

18:08.019 --> 18:10.387
You did a great job
getting this thing
working again.

18:10.388 --> 18:12.890
Thanks, dad.
I couldn't have done it
without your help.

18:12.891 --> 18:14.892
You're the one
that got it all cleaned up,

18:14.893 --> 18:16.894
Fixed that spring
on the bottom.

18:16.895 --> 18:20.230
And the best part is,
you're gonna disappear in it.

18:20.231 --> 18:22.232
Ok, dad. We're ready.
Oh, all right.

18:22.233 --> 18:24.234
Honey, come on down!
We're all set.

18:24.235 --> 18:26.070
You guys know what to do.

18:26.071 --> 18:28.238
When she gets down here,
on three. Ready?

<i>(grunts)</i> you're the best.

You all look like
such little gentlemen.

18:38.149 --> 18:41.585
You're so clean
and well-groomed.

18:41.586 --> 18:44.054
Mom, you don't have to
rub it in.

18:44.055 --> 18:47.224
This is the best
mother's day gift
I could get.

18:47.225 --> 18:48.892
Come on,
let's go to dinner.

18:48.893 --> 18:50.560
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

18:54.599 --> 18:58.468
All right, mom.
Happy mother's day.
It's a jewelry box.

18:58.469 --> 19:01.038
Brad, this is beautiful.

19:01.039 --> 19:04.507
But look what I made you.

19:04.508 --> 19:06.309
Let me see.

19:06.310 --> 19:08.311
Happy mother's day,
mom.

19:08.312 --> 19:10.380
It's a recipe box.
I love this.

19:10.381 --> 19:13.383
Look at it. It's made
out of popsicle sticks.

19:13.384 --> 19:16.253
What a surprise.

19:16.254 --> 19:17.721
And, mom?

19:17.722 --> 19:21.491
Here's my gift to you.
A magic trick.

19:21.492 --> 19:23.560
That is just
what I wanted.

19:23.561 --> 19:25.829
And it's real magic, too.
This is serious stuff.

19:25.830 --> 19:26.864
Yeah?

19:26.865 --> 19:28.832
Prepare to be amazed...

<i>(randy)</i>

Tim "the tool man" taylor.

19:42.380 --> 19:45.215
And a lovely assistant
he is, too.

19:45.216 --> 19:46.549
Yes.

19:46.550 --> 19:49.352
After I lock my assistant
in the trunk,

19:49.353 --> 19:51.855
He will then disappear.

19:51.856 --> 19:54.658
Oops. What's this?

19:54.659 --> 19:57.427
Oh, sorry.
That's my last assistant.

20:00.899 --> 20:04.835
Boy, I tell you,
you look a foot short.

20:04.836 --> 20:07.504
Close the lid!

20:09.174 --> 20:11.241
Brad, you wanna
help me out here?

20:13.878 --> 20:15.312

20:42.841 --> 20:46.376
I am amazed and astonished.

20:46.377 --> 20:49.746
Now I shall make him
reappear.

20:49.747 --> 20:53.783
Oh, what is your hurry?

20:53.784 --> 20:56.519
Abracadabra.
Don't stand near.

20:56.520 --> 21:00.324
Now my father
will appear.

Hey. Where is he?

21:05.730 --> 21:07.898
I don't know.

21:07.899 --> 21:11.068
Well, these are all
great presents, boys.
Let's go to dinner.

21:16.507 --> 21:19.509
