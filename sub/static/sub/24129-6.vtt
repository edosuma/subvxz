WEBVTT

00:03.371 --> 00:06.238
(whispering to self)
Okay, 205.

00:06.240 --> 00:07.973
Hey, by the way,
no pressure

00:07.975 --> 00:09.541
if you want to bail
at any point tonight.

00:09.543 --> 00:10.909
I know that
we had other plans.

00:10.911 --> 00:12.611
Emily,
it's totally fine.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.413
We can hang out
and ruin stuff any night.

00:14.415 --> 00:16.882
But it's not every day
that your old college roommate

00:16.884 --> 00:18.717
comes to town,
come on!

00:18.719 --> 00:20.319
Yeah.

00:20.321 --> 00:23.489
It'll be nice
to catch up, I guess.

00:24.992 --> 00:26.992
It's not that
I don't want to see her.

00:26.994 --> 00:29.061
I just...
I don't really know

00:29.063 --> 00:30.529
if we have anything
in common anymore,

00:30.531 --> 00:32.464
you know?

00:32.466 --> 00:34.333
Becks has always been

00:34.335 --> 00:37.403
a lot more...
fun than me.

00:37.405 --> 00:39.938
Oh, yeah, people say that
about me all the time, so.

00:39.940 --> 00:43.175
Like, when she goes out,
she goes out hard.

00:43.177 --> 00:45.344
Although, now that
we're in our thirties,

00:45.346 --> 00:47.346
I'm sure
she's probably--

00:47.348 --> 00:49.214
(gasps)
Emilicious!

00:49.216 --> 00:50.916
Becksalicious!

00:50.918 --> 00:53.085
(screaming)
(laughing)

00:53.087 --> 00:54.887
Is this your friend
you were talking about?

00:54.889 --> 00:56.688
Hi, Becks!
I like how loud you are.

00:56.690 --> 00:59.058
Ha-ha! Thank you!
He's adorable.

00:59.060 --> 01:01.760
Okay, you guys, I'm still
getting ready, so come on in.

01:01.762 --> 01:03.328
I just need
to shave really quick.

01:03.330 --> 01:04.463
I had to skip
this morning,

01:04.465 --> 01:06.098
and I feel like
such a troll person.

01:06.100 --> 01:08.867
Huh! A hundred years ago,
people never shaved that much.

01:08.869 --> 01:10.536
It's a pretty
fascinating history.

01:10.538 --> 01:13.372
Oh, yeah, the history
of shaving is bonkers.

01:13.374 --> 01:15.107
Okay.

01:15.109 --> 01:16.375
So, what is it?

01:16.377 --> 01:19.878
Wait, you...
want to hear about it?

01:19.880 --> 01:21.513
Sure, just talk to me
in the bathroom

01:21.515 --> 01:22.981
while I'm finishing up.

01:22.983 --> 01:24.316
Emily, you wanna
do the honors?

01:24.318 --> 01:27.419
Yeah-- Becks,
I'm Emily Axford.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.321
That's Adam Conover.

01:29.323 --> 01:32.658
And this is
"Adam and Emily
Ruin Everything."

01:42.336 --> 01:43.902
Sorry, guys,
I'll just be a few.

01:43.904 --> 01:46.638
I don't wanna scare any children
with these sasquatch legs.

01:46.640 --> 01:50.509
Yep, people definitely get
judgey about women's leg hair.

01:50.511 --> 01:52.878
But the fascinating thing
about shaving is

01:52.880 --> 01:55.047
almost no one did it
regularly at home

01:55.049 --> 01:58.150
until about a hundred years ago.

01:58.152 --> 02:00.986
What the (bleep), Emily?
Is this some sort of Purge shit?

02:00.988 --> 02:02.621
Oh, no no no,
don't worry.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.056
Me and Adam do this
all the time.

02:04.058 --> 02:07.226
Before the safety razor was
invented in the early 1900s,

02:07.228 --> 02:10.929
shaving with a straight razor
was a dangerous chore.

02:10.931 --> 02:13.031
So, most men either
went to a barber

02:13.033 --> 02:14.633
or didn't shave at all.

02:14.635 --> 02:17.503
No!... I can't do it.

02:17.505 --> 02:18.737
I've got a family.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.172
But all that changed

02:20.174 --> 02:22.207
when a man named
King Camp Gillette

02:22.209 --> 02:24.910
invented the first
disposable razor blade.

02:24.912 --> 02:26.111
Here, my good man,

02:26.113 --> 02:28.747
buy one of my safe,
disposable razors.

02:28.749 --> 02:30.415
Shaving your beard
will be such a breeze,

02:30.417 --> 02:31.717
you'll do it every day.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.053
Huh!

02:35.055 --> 02:36.889
Barely cut myself at all.

02:36.891 --> 02:38.690
The razors were
relatively cheap,

02:38.692 --> 02:42.027
but you'd have to keep
re-buying new blades.

02:42.029 --> 02:43.662
Refills cost extra,

02:43.664 --> 02:46.231
and you'll need
a new one every few weeks

02:46.233 --> 02:47.666
for the rest
of your life.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.701
But wait,
there's more.

02:49.703 --> 02:51.303
There is?
Oh, yeah.

02:51.305 --> 02:53.605
Gillette's real scam wasn't
getting people hooked

02:53.607 --> 02:55.274
on his replacement products,

02:55.276 --> 02:58.443
it was convincing women
that they had to shave too,

02:58.445 --> 03:00.245
for the first time
in history.

03:00.247 --> 03:01.914
And that story is--

03:01.916 --> 03:04.249
Super-messed up?
Heck yeah, it is!

03:04.251 --> 03:05.517
Oh.

03:05.519 --> 03:08.587
Up until 1920, most women
didn't shave at all.

03:08.589 --> 03:10.522
It was so unheard of that,

03:10.524 --> 03:12.758
when a teen girl cut
her legs shaving,

03:12.760 --> 03:14.993
it made national news.

03:14.995 --> 03:17.196
But all that changed
when old King Camp Gillette

03:17.198 --> 03:20.032
and the shaving industry started
thinking about how to expand

03:20.034 --> 03:21.900
to the disposable
razor business.

03:21.902 --> 03:24.203
Of course! Women!

03:24.205 --> 03:25.904
The other half
of the population.

03:25.906 --> 03:27.105
(snaps)

03:27.107 --> 03:29.942
But since most women
don't have beards,

03:29.944 --> 03:31.743
the shaving industry
had to convince women

03:31.745 --> 03:34.913
that they even had body hair
that needed shaving.

03:34.915 --> 03:38.750
So they whipped up some
manipulative advertising.

03:38.752 --> 03:41.653
First ads falsely claimed
that, in Europe,

03:41.655 --> 03:44.289
being hairless
was all the rage.

03:44.291 --> 03:48.860
Shaving your underarms is the
height of sophistication in...

03:48.862 --> 03:51.964
uh, "Franland" and "Spaintugal."

03:51.966 --> 03:54.600
Then, they pushed
the explicit message

03:54.602 --> 03:57.736
that women should be ashamed
of their armpit hair.

03:57.738 --> 04:00.639
But why would women's magazines
let advertisers

04:00.641 --> 04:02.007
say this junk to women?

04:02.009 --> 04:03.875
(woman)
Because that
was the whole point.

04:03.877 --> 04:05.510
(Emily)
Becks, this is
Rebecca Herzig,

04:05.512 --> 04:08.880
the author of "Plucked:
A History of Hair Removal."

04:08.882 --> 04:10.716
Becks, the reason
that these magazines

04:10.718 --> 04:13.418
didn't have any scruples about
shaming women into shaving

04:13.420 --> 04:17.256
in those days was because
that was pretty much
the whole point of the industry:

04:17.258 --> 04:18.957
getting women to buy things.

04:18.959 --> 04:21.893
Millions of women around the
globe trusted these magazines

04:21.895 --> 04:24.496
for advice, especially
as more and more young women

04:24.498 --> 04:27.266
were moving into cities and
living their lives cut off

04:27.268 --> 04:28.367
from their families.

04:28.369 --> 04:30.769
And publishers exploited
that trust,

04:30.771 --> 04:32.471
selling it off
to advertisers

04:32.473 --> 04:34.172
so that they could try
to convince women

04:34.174 --> 04:36.541
that if only they
bought their products

04:36.543 --> 04:38.944
all their problems
would be solved.

04:38.946 --> 04:41.780
And obviously making women think
that there was something wrong

04:41.782 --> 04:44.182
with their arm pit hair
was only the beginning.

04:44.184 --> 04:48.186
As fashion and culture evolved
to let women show more skin,

04:48.188 --> 04:51.923
they were also expected
to shave more skin.

04:51.925 --> 04:53.659
¶¶

04:53.661 --> 04:56.595
During the silk and nylon
rations of World War II,

04:56.597 --> 04:59.498
going stocking free
was considered patriotic.

04:59.500 --> 05:02.634
So long as you were
also hair free.

05:02.636 --> 05:05.237
If I don't shave my legs,
we'll lose the war.

05:05.239 --> 05:08.206
(Emily)
And when the bikini
was born in 1946,

05:08.208 --> 05:10.008
so was the bikini line.

05:10.010 --> 05:12.110
The only thing worse
than tan lines

05:12.112 --> 05:13.779
is a hair line.

05:13.781 --> 05:15.080
At least that's what
all the boys are saying

05:15.082 --> 05:17.049
at Makeout Beach.

05:17.051 --> 05:19.217
And with the rise of porn
in the '70s,

05:19.219 --> 05:22.487
women started getting pressured
to go all the way bare...

05:22.489 --> 05:23.655
(whispers)
down there.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.090
Well, all right!

05:25.092 --> 05:27.426
You ladies ready for some
inescapable cultural pressure

05:27.428 --> 05:31.029
to conform to what
I think is sexy?

05:31.031 --> 05:33.899
Yeah, no!
We're not gonna
show that, so...

05:33.901 --> 05:38.036
And American culture hit peak
hair removal in the year 2000

05:38.038 --> 05:40.305
when an entire episode
of "Sex and the City"

05:40.307 --> 05:43.842
was dedicated to...
the Brazilian wax.

05:43.844 --> 05:46.478
<i> I feel like one of those</i>
<i> freakin' hairless dogs.</i>

05:46.480 --> 05:49.147
<i> It's an esthetic thing.</i>
<i> Everyone goes bare out here.</i>

05:49.149 --> 05:51.383
I'm such an Elizabeth.

05:51.385 --> 05:53.085
Not a character, Adam.

05:53.087 --> 05:58.056
The cultural pressure
to shave is still very real.

05:58.058 --> 05:59.558
The average American woman

05:59.560 --> 06:03.028
spends almost $200 per year
on hair removal.

06:03.030 --> 06:06.064
And here's the kicker--
Women's shaving products

06:06.066 --> 06:10.268
cost more than men's even though
the only thing that's different

06:10.270 --> 06:12.938
is the packaging.

06:12.940 --> 06:14.806
It's called the pink tax.

06:14.808 --> 06:17.275
Seriously?
That's ridiculous.
Yup.

06:17.277 --> 06:19.177
But what's even
more ridiculous

06:19.179 --> 06:21.079
is that the marketing strategy
of making women

06:21.081 --> 06:23.315
think they need
to buy things to fix themself

06:23.317 --> 06:25.217
is still being used today!

06:26.253 --> 06:28.220
We see it in beauty products,

06:28.222 --> 06:32.424
diet foods and drinks,
even office supplies.

06:32.426 --> 06:35.927
But the reason shaving,
in particular,
really pisses me off

06:35.929 --> 06:39.164
is that most people
expect women to do it.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.333
Gillette and his cronies
convinced everyone

06:41.335 --> 06:44.269
that it's the friggin'
end of the world if a woman
has any body hair.

06:44.271 --> 06:49.074
So, even though I think
it's a complete waste of time,
I still usually do it.

06:49.076 --> 06:52.377
Fascinating and depressing.
Solid ruin, Em.

06:52.379 --> 06:53.478
Thank you.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.480
Yeah, I truly
never thought twice

06:55.482 --> 06:56.848
about shaving before now,

06:56.850 --> 07:00.385
but it really is such
pointless bullshit.

07:02.156 --> 07:05.624
But I already did this one
so I might as well even it out.

07:05.626 --> 07:06.858
Go with my blessing.

07:06.860 --> 07:09.027
Oh, hey, Em.
Are you bringing
a purse tonight?

07:09.029 --> 07:10.228
I don't want to carry
one in the club,

07:10.230 --> 07:11.730
but I need
somewhere to put my stuff.

07:11.732 --> 07:13.398
They can't fit
in your pockets?

07:13.400 --> 07:16.601
Oh, a lot of women's clothing
doesn't even have pockets.

07:16.603 --> 07:19.638
And there's a crazy history
behind that too.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.139
Oh, boy!

07:24.445 --> 07:26.745
Em, you ready to dance
our frickin' butts off?

07:26.747 --> 07:28.346
Oh, yeah...

07:30.818 --> 07:34.820
Love how loud it is and all
the strangers touching me.

07:34.822 --> 07:36.621
Emily, will you put
my stuff in your purse?

07:36.623 --> 07:38.690
I don't want it to jingle
jangle while I dance.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.292
Oh, I didn't bring one.

07:40.294 --> 07:42.127
I just stuffed everything
in my bra.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.196
Adam, you have pockets,
you can carry all of our stuff.

07:44.198 --> 07:47.632
Here are my keys,
phone, wallet, bronzer.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.568
Thank you.
What about your pockets?

07:49.570 --> 07:50.902
Oh, I don't have any.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.671
I guess it would mess with the
line of the dress or whatever.

07:52.673 --> 07:55.040
Oh, no.
Actually, the real reason

07:55.042 --> 07:56.741
women's clothing doesn't have
practical pockets

07:56.743 --> 08:00.579
is because of centuries
of sexism and classism, and...

08:00.581 --> 08:02.280
Sorry, Adam,
please hold my stuff too.

08:02.282 --> 08:04.616
Eh?!

08:04.618 --> 08:06.318
(crowd cheering)

08:06.320 --> 08:09.788
When pockets first became
popular in the 18th century,

08:09.790 --> 08:12.190
they were fraught
with political symbolism.

08:12.192 --> 08:14.159
And only for men.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.361
As men's fashion trended
away from tights

08:16.363 --> 08:18.430
and more towards
something closer to pants,

08:18.432 --> 08:19.965
two styles emerged:

08:19.967 --> 08:22.534
for the wealthy man,
tight fitting culottes

08:22.536 --> 08:24.402
without practical pockets

08:24.404 --> 08:26.605
because pockets would mean
you weren't rich enough

08:26.607 --> 08:28.540
to pay people
to carry your stuff.

08:28.542 --> 08:30.609
And for the average poor man,

08:30.611 --> 08:33.712
wide legged baggy trousers
with deep pockets

08:33.714 --> 08:36.915
you could keep
all your peasant stuff in.

08:36.917 --> 08:39.618
And as the spirit of equality
swept Europe,

08:39.620 --> 08:42.354
so did the trend
for baggier, pocketier pants.

08:42.356 --> 08:45.490
Fill your pockets with the songs
of angry men...

08:45.492 --> 08:48.527
(crowd cheering)

08:48.529 --> 08:51.229
...and you're keys.

08:51.231 --> 08:55.200
Pockets were in many
ways a revolutionary idea,

08:55.202 --> 08:58.436
but not one deemed appropriate
for women.

08:58.438 --> 09:01.206
You see, people thought it would
make them too independent.

09:01.208 --> 09:05.010
It was considered unladylike
to carry anything larger

09:05.012 --> 09:06.545
than a teeny tiny purse.

09:06.547 --> 09:09.314
M'lady, in this fight
for liberty,

09:09.316 --> 09:12.350
I shall carry everything
you need to function in society.

09:12.352 --> 09:15.987
¶¶

09:15.989 --> 09:18.290
Some women fought back
in the late 1800s

09:18.292 --> 09:21.159
wearing extremely
baggy pants with pockets

09:21.161 --> 09:24.229
as part of the rational
dress movement.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.564
Stop!
(music stops)

09:25.566 --> 09:26.731
Pocket time!

09:26.733 --> 09:29.334
(crowd cheers, music playing)

09:29.336 --> 09:31.136
You can't touch this.

09:31.138 --> 09:34.472
As in my new found sense
of independence.

09:34.474 --> 09:37.409
But men of the era couldn't wrap
their narrow-minded brains

09:37.411 --> 09:40.078
around it,
newspaper editorials at the time

09:40.080 --> 09:42.147
speculated that the pockets
of the new woman

09:42.149 --> 09:43.515
were a weird fetish.

09:43.517 --> 09:45.150
Whatever floats
your boats ladies,

09:45.152 --> 09:49.154
but I think having pockets makes
you some kind of sex freak.

09:49.156 --> 09:51.890
And women have had
to continue to fight

09:51.892 --> 09:54.659
for more practical clothing
throughout history.

09:56.396 --> 09:59.030
In 1954, Christian Dior,
one of fashion's

09:59.032 --> 10:02.233
most influential designers said,
"Men have pockets

10:02.235 --> 10:05.070
to keep things in.
Women, for decoration."

10:05.072 --> 10:08.239
Even today, when women's
clothing has pockets,

10:08.241 --> 10:11.209
the cuts are typically
too tight to be useful.

10:11.211 --> 10:13.812
One study compared
women's and men's pants

10:13.814 --> 10:16.648
across 20 brands and found that
women's pockets

10:16.650 --> 10:18.984
were half the size of men's.

10:18.986 --> 10:22.520
I mean, where would
the pockets even go?

10:22.522 --> 10:24.189
That is so unfair.

10:24.191 --> 10:26.391
Yup. Not having
practical clothing

10:26.393 --> 10:28.627
limits women's ability
to function.

10:28.629 --> 10:32.831
I mean, why can't
I look amazeballs and have
a place to put my phone?

10:32.833 --> 10:35.867
Yeah, you know, men's pockets
don't hold everything either.

10:35.869 --> 10:37.202
I got stuffed here.

10:37.204 --> 10:39.604
Well, there's
an answer for that.

10:39.606 --> 10:41.740
A purse!
Perfect!

10:41.742 --> 10:44.075
But, wait,
I'm a guy, is this okay?

10:44.077 --> 10:47.846
It should be, but everyone
acts like having a bag
is a girl thing.

10:47.848 --> 10:49.280
Like in that
"Friends" episode.

10:49.282 --> 10:51.182
It's got compartments
for all your stuff:

10:51.184 --> 10:53.418
your wallet,
your keys,
you're address book.

10:53.420 --> 10:54.452
Your makeup.

10:56.089 --> 10:59.357
Yeah, stuff like this
gets stuck in guys' heads

10:59.359 --> 11:01.693
and makes us too embarrassed
to deviate from what's

11:01.695 --> 11:03.228
supposed to be "manly."

11:03.230 --> 11:06.031
I've lived in fear that Ross
was gonna yell at me.

11:06.033 --> 11:09.467
But that's stupid.
Ross sucks!

11:11.772 --> 11:13.571
(chanting)
Give ladies pockets!

11:13.573 --> 11:15.907
(chanting)
Let men have purses.

11:15.909 --> 11:18.543
(quietly)
I agree, but less obnoxiously.

11:19.813 --> 11:20.879
All right, time to go.

11:20.881 --> 11:23.548
Oh, what?
Is this about my purse?

11:23.550 --> 11:25.817
No, man.
It's about your personality.

11:25.819 --> 11:27.252
Let's go.

11:27.254 --> 11:30.722
Pshh! Who wants to spend all
night in a crowded club anyways?

11:30.724 --> 11:32.190
I thought we did.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.358
But if you guys
don't wanna dance,

11:33.360 --> 11:35.060
I guess we could grab
a drink somewhere.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.261
I could really use one.

11:36.263 --> 11:39.130
Oh, I know a place that makes
great Shirley Temples.

11:39.132 --> 11:41.966
Whatever you guys want,
first round's on me.

11:41.968 --> 11:44.269
Actually, it'll probably
have to just be one round.

11:44.271 --> 11:46.037
Yeah, I have MMA
in the morning.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.673
Plus, alcohol
is basically poison,

11:48.675 --> 11:50.375
but I can try and forget that
for a night.

11:50.377 --> 11:51.676
(whip cracks)

11:52.679 --> 11:54.179
Okay...

11:54.181 --> 11:56.381
This night is going great.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.216
Okay.

12:01.455 --> 12:04.289
Hm... do I want to go
to Chez Fancy Pants,

12:04.291 --> 12:07.926
or Jimmy's Down Home Burger's
and Ribs?

12:07.928 --> 12:11.896
Probably neither because
they're both too dang loud!

12:11.898 --> 12:14.599
Have you ever noticed how
freaking deafening

12:14.601 --> 12:16.101
restaurants are these days?

12:16.103 --> 12:17.602
You're not alone.

12:17.604 --> 12:19.771
Both Zagat
and Consumer Reports surveys

12:19.773 --> 12:23.274
have found that excessive noise
is the top complaint diners have

12:23.276 --> 12:27.245
before even service, crowds,
or even screwing up
your dang order

12:27.247 --> 12:28.913
by forgetting
your tater tots.

12:28.915 --> 12:32.083
A study by the New York Times
even found that some restaurants

12:32.085 --> 12:34.986
(metal screeching)
were louder
than a G.D. subway tunnel.

12:34.988 --> 12:37.856
That's so loud that it can cause
hearing damage.

12:37.858 --> 12:41.960
So, why are restaurants
so dang loud?

12:41.962 --> 12:45.630
One guy we can blame
is Chef Mario Francesco Batali.

12:45.632 --> 12:48.566
Yes, that Mario Batali.

12:48.568 --> 12:50.535
The same one who was accused
of sexual assault

12:50.537 --> 12:53.638
and responded with
a cinnamon roll recipe.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.840
Batali, first pumped loud music
into the dining room

12:55.842 --> 12:58.343
at his restaurant Babbo
in the late '90s.

12:58.345 --> 13:01.045
(loud music playing)
And over the next two decades
this approach

13:01.047 --> 13:03.348
became a sonic standard.

13:03.350 --> 13:06.785
Modern restaurant design has
made the issue even worse.

13:06.787 --> 13:09.287
the stark post industrial
aesthetic of today

13:09.289 --> 13:12.824
leaves us with few
of the sound dampeners
restaurants used to rely on.

13:12.826 --> 13:15.593
Tablecloths, carpets, drapes,
and velvet booths

13:15.595 --> 13:18.129
have been replaced by
sonically reflective surfaces

13:18.131 --> 13:21.166
like polished metal,
concrete, and glass.

13:21.168 --> 13:23.968
One study found that louder
music increased

13:23.970 --> 13:26.704
and even sped up
alcohol consumption.

13:26.706 --> 13:30.942
But save it for the club,
not my chicken club.

13:30.944 --> 13:34.179
(loud music, loud chatter)
I mean, why did you think this
was such a good idea?! Huh?

13:34.181 --> 13:35.180
(people shushing)

13:35.182 --> 13:37.982
Oh. Oops, sorry.
My bad.

13:37.984 --> 13:39.617
I'm just gonna
go eat take out at home.

13:41.254 --> 13:43.621
I am so sorry about this.
We will have one drink

13:43.623 --> 13:45.123
and then we'll
call it a night.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.258
Uh, I'm actually having
a great time.

13:47.260 --> 13:48.326
Are you not having fun?

13:48.328 --> 13:51.262
Okay!
Shirley Temple for Adam.

13:51.264 --> 13:53.765
And Emily, not to be
cheesy or whatever,

13:53.767 --> 13:55.867
but in honor of our
college years,

13:55.869 --> 13:58.870
I got us
white wine spritzers.

13:58.872 --> 14:01.506
Remember when we used to have
like ten of these in a night?

14:01.508 --> 14:03.942
(laughing)
Oh, man, I...

14:03.944 --> 14:05.109
definitely don't.

14:05.111 --> 14:06.644
Cheers! (giggles)

14:06.646 --> 14:08.913
(glasses clink)

14:08.915 --> 14:10.481
Adam, are you sure you
don't want a real drink?

14:10.483 --> 14:12.517
Can't ruin wine.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.686
A glass a day is good
for your heart or whatever.

14:14.688 --> 14:17.488
No, thanks.
I'm good with my Shirley T.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.357
And actually,
the alcohol industry

14:19.359 --> 14:21.459
just wants you to think that
moderate drinking is healthy

14:21.461 --> 14:24.529
to distract you
from the indisputable
health risks.

14:24.531 --> 14:25.730
Oh, yeah.

14:25.732 --> 14:27.765
No, no, no.
You guys are both wrong.

14:27.767 --> 14:31.002
I read you'll actually die
sooner if you don't drink.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.437
There have been studies.

14:32.439 --> 14:34.973
Yeah, people love
citing that stat.

14:34.975 --> 14:36.507
But the problem is...

14:36.509 --> 14:38.943
it's not true.

14:38.945 --> 14:41.813
The media is constantly
telling us

14:41.815 --> 14:44.549
that non drinkers actually have
higher mortality rates

14:44.551 --> 14:46.017
than moderate drinkers.

14:46.019 --> 14:48.319
Yeah, see, it's right
on the graph.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.822
Well, the problem with studies
that show this result

14:50.824 --> 14:53.591
is they're based
on some very flawed data.

14:53.593 --> 14:55.593
It turns out that
if you take a closer look

14:55.595 --> 14:57.528
at the cohort
of non drinkers,

14:57.530 --> 14:58.997
many of them
are less healthy

14:58.999 --> 15:01.332
for completely
unrelated reasons.

15:01.334 --> 15:04.335
Some simply can't
afford to drink

15:04.337 --> 15:06.571
or pay for health insurance.

15:06.573 --> 15:09.140
Others already suffer
from medical conditions

15:09.142 --> 15:10.842
that prevent them
from drinking.

15:10.844 --> 15:12.877
(sad trombone sound)

15:12.879 --> 15:16.314
And some are former drinkers
who've already suffered

15:16.316 --> 15:18.549
the negative health
effects of alcohol abuse.

15:18.551 --> 15:21.886
If the studies had taken this
skewing effect into account,

15:21.888 --> 15:24.355
the graph would
have looked like this

15:24.357 --> 15:26.858
indicating that there
are zero health advantages

15:26.860 --> 15:28.927
to being a moderate drinker.

15:28.929 --> 15:30.161
Seriously?

15:30.163 --> 15:32.263
(slurring)
No, but wait.
Hold up.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.932
It gets wor-- worse.

15:33.934 --> 15:36.868
Whoa, Emily,
you're already plastered.

15:36.870 --> 15:39.504
Yeah, bitch!
I barely drink anymore.

15:39.506 --> 15:41.005
Whoo!

15:41.007 --> 15:42.740
Becks, truth is...

15:42.742 --> 15:45.243
drinking is not only
not good for you,

15:45.245 --> 15:49.113
it's actually like super bad
for you healthy times.

15:49.115 --> 15:51.749
What about all the
antioxidants in wine?

15:51.751 --> 15:53.084
Those fight cancer.

15:53.086 --> 15:56.454
Snopes! There is actually
no conclusive evidence

15:56.456 --> 15:58.923
that antioxidants
in wine do anything.

15:58.925 --> 16:00.124
(Adam)
That's true.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.826
But the real reason this myth
is messed up,

16:01.828 --> 16:04.095
is that far
from preventing cancer,

16:04.097 --> 16:05.430
there's actually
considerable evidence

16:05.432 --> 16:08.199
that drinking alcohol
risks causing it.

16:08.201 --> 16:11.636
Alcohol is a Group 1
known carcinogen.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.738
In fact,
the World Health Organization

16:13.740 --> 16:16.941
attributes over half a million
cancer deaths worldwide

16:16.943 --> 16:19.510
to alcohol consumption
every year.

16:19.512 --> 16:23.681
(slurring)
Plus, alcohol is special
extra kind of cancerous...

16:23.683 --> 16:27.452
for ladies! Whoo!
Whoo!

16:27.454 --> 16:30.021
Why are you "whooing?"
This is not a time to "whoo."

16:30.023 --> 16:31.222
Definitely not.

16:31.224 --> 16:34.659
Ooh, I am kind of obnoxious
when I drink.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.761
Becks, look.

16:36.763 --> 16:38.963
Every cancer diagnosis
is different,

16:38.965 --> 16:42.266
but studies show that booze
is a factor in an estimated

16:42.268 --> 16:45.937
15% of breast cancer
cases annually.

16:45.939 --> 16:48.673
That's 6,000
deaths per year.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.708
Yes, thank you.
Please cut me off.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.443
Now, to be clear,

16:52.445 --> 16:54.912
this doesn't mean that avoiding
alcohol prevents cancer,

16:54.914 --> 16:57.582
or that if you've received
a breast cancer diagnosis

16:57.584 --> 16:58.850
your choices are to blame.

16:58.852 --> 17:01.085
The truth is
no type of cancer

17:01.087 --> 17:03.521
can be pegged
to just one behavioral quality.

17:03.523 --> 17:04.956
But there's no denying

17:04.958 --> 17:07.658
that drinking comes
with certain health risks.

17:07.660 --> 17:10.461
So isn't it weird that
we never talk about it?

17:10.463 --> 17:12.930
I mean, we all know
that smoking is bad for us,

17:12.932 --> 17:15.366
but 70%
of Americans

17:15.368 --> 17:19.203
have no idea that alcohol
can cause cancer too.

17:19.205 --> 17:22.306
I sure didn't.
Why doesn't anyone
talk about this?

17:22.308 --> 17:25.777
Because Big Booze has spent
decades covering up the data

17:25.779 --> 17:28.079
with their own bad science.

17:28.081 --> 17:30.948
Just like Big Tobacco
used to do for cigarettes.

17:30.950 --> 17:33.518
For instance,
in 1994,

17:33.520 --> 17:36.621
the Distilled Spirits Council
actually hired a scientist

17:36.623 --> 17:38.856
from tobacco powerhouse
Philip Morris

17:38.858 --> 17:41.459
and paid for a study
that disputed the link

17:41.461 --> 17:43.661
between alcohol
and breast cancer.

17:43.663 --> 17:44.762
(slide whistle)

17:44.764 --> 17:46.531
(slurring)
In fact m--
Big Booze funds

17:46.533 --> 17:48.366
most studies on alcohol.

17:48.368 --> 17:50.501
And not just the ones
that dispute harm.

17:50.503 --> 17:53.104
They also spend
billions on research

17:53.106 --> 17:56.107
that "supposably" shows
"health benefits."

17:56.109 --> 17:57.842
Beers are on me.

17:57.844 --> 18:00.311
And so are the studies that
say they're good for you.

18:00.313 --> 18:03.948
Big Booze is so dedicated
to controlling how we perceive

18:03.950 --> 18:06.818
drinking in the US they've
lobbied against measures

18:06.820 --> 18:08.986
that might
reduce problem drinking

18:08.988 --> 18:11.522
like warning labels
and sales taxes.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.092
Pshh!

18:14.094 --> 18:16.427
Whoo!
Nickel shots!

18:16.429 --> 18:18.996
And don't forget the massive
amounts of money

18:18.998 --> 18:22.834
they spend pouring alcohol
advertising down our throats.

18:22.836 --> 18:24.235
<i> Cheers!</i>

18:24.237 --> 18:27.405
And now Americans are drinking
way more than we used to.

18:27.407 --> 18:29.340
The number of adults
that binge drink

18:29.342 --> 18:33.711
at least once a week could be as
high as 30 million.

18:33.713 --> 18:36.814
Okay, guys. I get that this
is all very important, but--

18:36.816 --> 18:38.649
(slurring)
Oh, my God, you have
to meet my friend.

18:40.286 --> 18:42.220
Becks, this is who
I was telling you about.

18:42.222 --> 18:45.189
Doctor Timothy Naimi,
an epidemiologist

18:45.191 --> 18:47.792
who's worked on alcohol
task forces at the CDC

18:47.794 --> 18:49.527
and the National Institutes
of Health.

18:49.529 --> 18:52.430
(Naimi)
Becks, although alcohol
is marketed to us

18:52.432 --> 18:54.298
like it's part
of a healthy lifestyle,

18:54.300 --> 18:56.367
the idea that there's
health benefits

18:56.369 --> 18:58.469
from moderate drinking
is probably crap.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.638
Most people's
"moderate drinking"

19:00.640 --> 19:03.741
actually exceeds the dietary
guideline suggested limits

19:03.743 --> 19:06.644
of no more than one drink
in a day for women,

19:06.646 --> 19:08.212
and no more than
two drinks in a day for men.

19:08.214 --> 19:11.282
That's not to say that people
shouldn't enjoy alcohol at all,

19:11.284 --> 19:13.251
but what we know
is that if you drink,

19:13.253 --> 19:15.286
drinking less is better
for your health.

19:15.288 --> 19:17.688
Well, now it feels like
I don't have a choice.

19:17.690 --> 19:19.891
You're basically like,
"Yeah, go on, keep drinking...

19:19.893 --> 19:21.192
if you're an idiot."

19:21.194 --> 19:23.327
No, Becks,
we're not judging you.

19:23.329 --> 19:25.763
It's fun to do things
that are bad for us

19:25.765 --> 19:27.031
every once in a while.

19:27.033 --> 19:29.767
We just shouldn't pretend
that they're healthy.

19:29.769 --> 19:32.036
Just like how I write in the
margins of books, even though

19:32.038 --> 19:34.205
I know it lowers
their resale value.

19:34.207 --> 19:35.740
But it's just
such a rush!

19:35.742 --> 19:37.542
(Naimi)
Drinking has become
so normalized

19:37.544 --> 19:39.010
as part of American culture.

19:39.012 --> 19:42.513
And we feel like, well, as long
as I'm not a "alcoholic"

19:42.515 --> 19:44.315
I can pretty much drink
whatever I want.

19:44.317 --> 19:47.151
The fact is, is that health
professionals agree

19:47.153 --> 19:51.489
that risky drinking
exists across a wide spectrum
of consumption.

19:51.491 --> 19:55.860
Only 5% of Americans meet
the medical definition
for alcohol dependency,

19:55.862 --> 19:59.664
but it's important to know
that about 30% of Americans

19:59.666 --> 20:01.999
drink in ways that clearly
increase their risk

20:02.001 --> 20:04.669
for a variety
of alcohol related consequences.

20:04.671 --> 20:06.370
(slurring)
And the "shtigma" of alcoholism

20:06.372 --> 20:09.907
makes people less willing
to examine their own

20:09.909 --> 20:12.210
alcohol consumption
and cut back,

20:12.212 --> 20:15.213
because they don't want to think
they have a drinking problem.

20:15.215 --> 20:17.915
Okay, it sorta feels like
you're saying

20:17.917 --> 20:19.517
I have a drinking problem.

20:19.519 --> 20:21.052
Oh, no, no, no.

20:21.054 --> 20:23.554
So, all I'm saying is--
Actually,
you know what it is?

20:23.556 --> 20:25.590
You don't have an issue
with my drinking,

20:25.592 --> 20:28.392
you have an issue
with me, okay.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.428
Doctor Naimi,
really nice to meet you.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.029
So sorry you got
dragged into this.

20:32.031 --> 20:33.431
(Emily)
Oh, no, Becks.
Wait!

20:33.433 --> 20:35.666
Honestly, Emily, if you didn't
want to come out tonight,

20:35.668 --> 20:37.201
why didn't you just say so?

20:37.203 --> 20:39.704
(slurring)
I don't know, I mean,
we were best friends in college.

20:39.706 --> 20:41.005
I kinda had to.

20:41.007 --> 20:43.274
Had to?! Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

20:43.276 --> 20:45.042
I mean, are we even
friends anymore?

20:45.044 --> 20:47.211
Oh, actually,
now that you mention it,

20:47.213 --> 20:48.646
according to this one study
that I read--

20:48.648 --> 20:50.648
Oh, my God!
Stop!

20:57.023 --> 20:58.623
I wouldn't say totally.

20:58.625 --> 21:00.191
Becks, we owe you
an apology.

21:00.193 --> 21:01.626
You know,
between you and me,

21:01.628 --> 21:03.861
Emily can kind of get carried
away with the ruining.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.763
I learned it
from watching you!

21:05.765 --> 21:09.567
Actually, you've always
sort of been like this, okay?

21:09.569 --> 21:13.037
Except now with snapping
and learning ghosts.

21:13.039 --> 21:15.006
But if I'm being
totally honest,

21:15.008 --> 21:17.541
you've always made me feel like
I'm too dumb for you.

21:17.543 --> 21:19.977
Well, if I'm being
honest-honest,

21:19.979 --> 21:22.947
you've always made me feel
like you're too cool for me.

21:22.949 --> 21:25.716
Becks, if you can handle
one more ruin,

21:25.718 --> 21:27.985
I think the study
Emily mentioned,

21:27.987 --> 21:29.820
might actually help both
of you feel better.

21:29.822 --> 21:32.223
How? By making me realize that
Emily is a big know-it-all

21:32.225 --> 21:33.924
and doesn't want
to be friends with me?

21:33.926 --> 21:34.825
Exactly.

21:34.827 --> 21:36.093
Many studies have shown

21:36.095 --> 21:38.996
that up to half of friendships
aren't reciprocal.

21:38.998 --> 21:42.266
So, maybe you were never
friends to begin with.

21:42.268 --> 21:43.668
I think we were
friends at some point,

21:43.670 --> 21:45.436
but we've definitely
drifted apart.

21:45.438 --> 21:48.005
Well, that's
totally natural too.

21:48.007 --> 21:50.007
According to an
anthropological concept

21:50.009 --> 21:53.277
called Dunbar's Number,
the human brain can only handle

21:53.279 --> 21:55.346
five close relationships.

21:55.348 --> 21:57.948
(laughter)

21:59.852 --> 22:00.918
(balloon deflating sound)

22:00.920 --> 22:02.586
I guess I didn't
want to admit it,

22:02.588 --> 22:04.588
but we're not friends.

22:04.590 --> 22:07.158
And we haven't
been for awhile.

22:07.160 --> 22:09.160
I mean, I didn't even
want to go to your wedding.

22:09.162 --> 22:10.661
Aw...

22:10.663 --> 22:13.130
I didn't even want
to invite you.

22:13.132 --> 22:15.066
You know, this made me
feel so much better.

22:15.068 --> 22:17.368
Em, see you never.

22:17.370 --> 22:21.072
Adam, we are definitely
hanging out again.
You cool as shit.

22:23.142 --> 22:24.275
Whoo!

22:25.611 --> 22:27.311
There we go.
There we go.
Yeah.

22:27.313 --> 22:30.715
(slurring)
Well, looks like
we ruined everyone's night.

22:30.717 --> 22:32.350
Including our own.

22:32.352 --> 22:34.218
Yeah, I had a blast.

22:34.220 --> 22:37.121
By the way, you know,
eating doesn't actually
sober you up, right?

22:37.123 --> 22:38.189
Ah!

22:38.191 --> 22:40.124
Dang it.
Come on. All right.

22:40.126 --> 22:41.158
You know what?
You can't drive.

22:41.160 --> 22:42.727
I'm putting you
on a bus.

22:44.997 --> 22:49.033
Mmm.
My head feels terrible.

22:49.035 --> 22:51.669
And my stomach...
(stomach bubbling)

22:51.671 --> 22:54.905
And my... elbow?

22:54.907 --> 22:58.876
Ugh, I drank way too much
last night.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.911
And what makes me
feel even worse,

23:00.913 --> 23:03.581
is that there's
no way to cure it

23:03.583 --> 23:07.017
because science doesn't really
know why we get hangovers

23:07.019 --> 23:08.452
in the first place.

23:08.454 --> 23:11.122
You might think that your
heinous headache

23:11.124 --> 23:13.924
and needling nausea
are caused by something like

23:13.926 --> 23:15.192
electrolyte imbalance,

23:15.194 --> 23:18.829
but even if your gam-gam swears
by Gatorade,

23:18.831 --> 23:21.999
recent research
hasn't shown any correlation

23:22.001 --> 23:25.169
between hangover symptoms
and electrolyte imbalance.

23:25.171 --> 23:27.204
So maybe it's low blood sugar.

23:27.206 --> 23:28.239
Except no!

23:28.241 --> 23:30.174
Sugar doesn't help cure
a hangover,

23:30.176 --> 23:32.009
so we know it's not that.

23:32.011 --> 23:36.213
And you certainly can't fix your
hangover with hair of the dog.

23:36.215 --> 23:37.948
That's a straight up myth.

23:37.950 --> 23:41.552
Truth is... we don't know
how we get hungover,

23:41.554 --> 23:44.121
because we don't entirely
understand how we get drunk

23:44.123 --> 23:45.389
in the first place.

23:45.391 --> 23:48.159
The most likely theory
is that hangovers

23:48.161 --> 23:50.895
are an inflammatory response
like what happens

23:50.897 --> 23:52.530
when we get an infection.

23:52.532 --> 23:55.299
You can try taking an
anti-inflammatory pain killer

23:55.301 --> 23:58.803
like ibuprofen, but those can
upset your stomach

23:58.805 --> 24:02.173
which is already pretty unhappy.
(bubbling)

24:02.175 --> 24:04.642
The only surefire cure
for a hangover

24:04.644 --> 24:06.610
is never drinking
in the first place.

24:06.612 --> 24:10.581
But if you do wind up knee-deep
in tequila sunrises--

24:10.583 --> 24:13.984
(whispers)
Oh, goddamnit, just the name.

24:13.986 --> 24:17.922
All you can do is drink a lotta
water and try to sleep it off.

24:17.924 --> 24:20.391
Which is what
I'm going to do.

24:21.494 --> 24:23.093
Right here.

24:24.897 --> 24:26.464
Can someone
take my mic back?

24:26.466 --> 24:28.699
I don't want everyone
to hear me snoring.

24:30.603 --> 24:32.169
Eh, who cares?

24:32.171 --> 24:33.170
(snoring)
