WEBVTT

00:00.835 --> 00:03.969
<i> PREVIOUSLY ON</i>
PRETTY LITTLE LIARS...

00:03.971 --> 00:06.338
THIS IS NO LONGER
A MISSING PERSONS
INVESTIGATION.

00:06.340 --> 00:07.706
IT'S A MURDER.

00:07.708 --> 00:10.242
I'M MR. FITZ,
YOUR NEW ENGLISH TEACHER.

00:10.244 --> 00:13.979
I WOULD NEVER WANT
TO DO ANYTHING THAT WOULD
GET YOU IN TROUBLE.

00:13.981 --> 00:16.615
WREN, I NEED YOU TO TELL THEM
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

00:16.617 --> 00:18.417
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD
MATTER WHAT I SAY.

00:18.419 --> 00:20.652
<i> I SAW THE WAY YOU WERE</i>
<i> LOOKING AT MY DAD YESTERDAY.</i>

00:20.654 --> 00:21.854
<i> I HAVE EYES.</i>

00:21.856 --> 00:24.523
FIND SOMEONE WHO'S AVAILABLE.
MY DAD ISN'T.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.425
WHO IS THAT?
TOBY.

00:26.427 --> 00:27.493
TOBY CAVANAUGH.

00:27.495 --> 00:28.627
WHISPER, WHISPER,
WHISPER.

00:28.629 --> 00:31.764
ALMOST FEELS LIKE
ALISON'S STILL HERE.

00:31.766 --> 00:33.298
BEN, I CAN'T
DO THIS RIGHT NOW.

00:33.300 --> 00:35.100
GET OFF--!

00:35.102 --> 00:36.101
STOP IT!

00:37.772 --> 00:40.973
<i> I THINK THERE'S</i>
<i> SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME.</i>

00:40.975 --> 00:42.341
WHERE ARE THE PICTURES?

00:42.343 --> 00:43.776
FIRST PAPER'S DUE MONDAY,

00:43.778 --> 00:47.079
AND I'VE WRITTEN
TWO WORDS-- MY NAME.

00:47.081 --> 00:47.846
LOOK.

00:47.848 --> 00:49.114
IS THAT YOURS?

00:49.116 --> 00:50.549
IT'S ALISON'S!

00:53.721 --> 00:55.621
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:55.623 --> 00:57.623
I DON'T WANT TO DO<i> THIS</i>
RIGHT NOW.

00:57.625 --> 00:58.891
HANNA.

00:58.893 --> 01:01.093
WHY ARE YOU TAKING
SEAN'S CAR?

01:01.095 --> 01:02.995
HANNA?

01:02.997 --> 01:04.029
( crash )

01:06.133 --> 01:07.666
Female Vocalists:
<i> ¶ UH-OH, UH-OH ¶</i>

01:07.668 --> 01:09.735
<i> ¶ HERE COMES TOMORROW ¶</i>

01:09.737 --> 01:11.036
<i> ¶ UH-OH, UH-OH ¶</i>

01:11.038 --> 01:14.206
<i> ¶ WHAT WILL WE</i>
<i> BORROW NOW? ¶</i>

01:14.208 --> 01:15.741
<i> ¶ I'LL PAY YOU BACK</i>
<i> SOMEHOW ¶</i>

01:17.678 --> 01:21.213
I NEVER WANTED
TO SEE ANOTHER POLICE CAR
IN FRONT OF THIS HOUSE.

01:21.215 --> 01:23.248
I THOUGHT WE WERE
DONE WITH THAT.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.384
MOM, I DIDN'T<i> TOTAL</i>
HIS CAR. THEY CAN FIX IT.

01:25.386 --> 01:28.353
THERE IS NOTHING
I CAN DO ABOUT THIS.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

01:32.860 --> 01:35.694
HOW BAD DID YOUR MOM
BUST YOU OVER WRECKING
SEAN'S CAR?

01:35.696 --> 01:38.163
OKAY, I DID NOT WRECK IT;
I DAMAGED IT.

01:38.165 --> 01:41.400
AND, ACTUALLY,
EVERYONE'S BEING
REALLY MATURE ABOUT IT.

01:41.402 --> 01:43.068
OH.
THERE'S NO "OH."

01:43.070 --> 01:45.204
WE'RE JUST BEING
GROWN-UPS, THAT'S ALL.

01:45.206 --> 01:47.906
OKAY, SO THE TOWN
IS GONNA PUT IN
A NEW BENCH,

01:47.908 --> 01:49.741
AND WE'LL PLANT
THE FLOWERBEDS,

01:49.743 --> 01:51.844
AND THERE'S GONNA BE
A PATHWAY OF ART TILES.

01:51.846 --> 01:53.045
ART TILES?

01:53.047 --> 01:55.948
MESSAGES, PICTURES,
MEMORIES OF ALISON.

01:55.950 --> 01:57.282
OH, LIKE LITTLE HEADSTONES.

01:57.284 --> 01:58.083
HANNA!
WHAT?

01:58.085 --> 01:59.718
WE SHOULD EACH DO A TILE.

01:59.720 --> 02:00.986
I'VE HAD ALISON'S BRACELET

02:00.988 --> 02:02.387
SINCE THE DAY WE
FOUND IT IN THE WOODS,

02:02.389 --> 02:05.390
AND I DON'T WANT
THE RESPONSIBILITY ANYMORE.

02:05.392 --> 02:06.558
I DON'T WANT IT.

02:06.560 --> 02:07.893
SERIOUSLY,
SOMEBODY TAKE THIS.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.197
LOOK AT US.
BUNCH OF BABIES.

02:16.704 --> 02:19.004
THERE'S NOTHING THAT "A"
CAN SAY OR DO

02:19.006 --> 02:20.139
TO GET US INTO TROUBLE

02:20.141 --> 02:21.573
WITHOUT MAKING TROUBLE
FOR HERSELF.

02:21.575 --> 02:22.875
ARE YOU SURE IT'S A "HER"?

02:22.877 --> 02:24.877
HIM, HER--
DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE.

02:32.386 --> 02:34.052
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:34.054 --> 02:36.922
I'M GONNA BLOCK ALL MESSAGES
FROM PEOPLE THAT I DON'T KNOW--

02:36.924 --> 02:40.526
IMs, TEXTS, E-MAILS,
EVERYTHING.

02:40.528 --> 02:41.793
SCREW "A."

02:41.795 --> 02:43.529
( beeping )
THERE.

02:44.732 --> 02:45.964
WHO'S NEXT?

02:51.105 --> 02:53.105
WHOA.

02:53.107 --> 02:56.441
I SPY WITH MY LITTLE EYE
SOMETHING THAT BEGINS WITH "F."

02:56.443 --> 02:59.444
HEY, MR. FITZ.

02:59.446 --> 03:01.947
LOOKING GOOD,
MR. FITZ.

03:01.949 --> 03:04.650
MY TURN.
( girls giggling )

03:04.652 --> 03:07.619
THERE ARE TEACHERS THAT
YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE
ON A BIKE,

03:07.621 --> 03:10.255
AND THERE ARE TEACHERS
THAT YOU<i> DO</i> WANT TO SEE
ON A BIKE.

03:10.257 --> 03:12.591
I WOULD NOT WANT TO SEE
MR. GILARDI ON A BIKE.

03:12.593 --> 03:15.494
I DON'T WANT TO THINK
OF MR. GILARDI IN MOTION
OF ANY KIND.

03:15.496 --> 03:16.762
( both chuckle )

03:16.764 --> 03:18.764
AH. MR. FITZ.

03:18.766 --> 03:20.098
HANNA. YOUR TURN.

03:23.837 --> 03:25.504
YOU TALK TO BEN?

03:25.506 --> 03:27.639
NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT.

03:27.641 --> 03:29.007
SO YOU'RE REALLY DONE?

03:29.009 --> 03:32.344
IT'S OKAY. I'M FINE.

03:32.346 --> 03:34.413
OKAY, IF YOU SAY SO.

03:34.415 --> 03:38.984
( sighs )
I WISH WE HAD
A DRUM ROLL FOR THIS.

03:38.986 --> 03:41.086
ALL RIGHT, HERE IT GOES.

03:41.088 --> 03:44.456
( beeping )
WE ARE OFFICIALLY
"A"-PROOFED.

03:44.458 --> 03:45.624
LISTEN.

03:45.626 --> 03:47.159
ALL THOSE LITTLE MESSAGES

03:47.161 --> 03:49.728
ZIPPING THROUGH THE AIR
ALL AROUND US.

03:49.730 --> 03:52.164
YEP, AND NONE
OF THEM FROM "A."

03:52.166 --> 03:53.899
THIS FEELS
LIKE A GOOD THING.

03:53.901 --> 03:56.301
OF COURSE
IT'S A GOOD THING.

03:56.303 --> 03:58.270
OUT OF MIND,
OUT OF SIGHT.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.467
The Pierces:
<i> ¶ GOT A SECRET ¶</i>

04:28.469 --> 04:29.668
<i> ¶ CAN YOU KEEP IT? ¶</i>

04:29.670 --> 04:31.937
<i> ¶ SWEAR THIS ONE YOU'LL SAVE ¶</i>

04:31.939 --> 04:34.339
<i> ¶ BETTER LOCK IT</i>
<i> IN YOUR POCKET ¶</i>

04:34.341 --> 04:37.042
<i> ¶ TAKING THIS ONE</i>
<i> TO THE GRAVE ¶</i>

04:37.044 --> 04:39.177
<i> ¶ IF I SHOW YOU</i>
<i> THEN I KNOW YOU ¶</i>

04:39.179 --> 04:41.580
<i> ¶ WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID ¶</i>

04:41.582 --> 04:44.349
<i> ¶ 'CAUSE TWO</i>
<i> CAN KEEP A SECRET ¶</i>

04:44.351 --> 04:46.518
<i> ¶ IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD ¶</i>

04:50.291 --> 04:51.523
HEY!
HEY!

04:51.525 --> 04:54.092
I GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU.

04:54.094 --> 04:57.763
I SAW THIS
AND THOUGHT IT WAS

04:57.765 --> 05:00.532
THE GREATEST COLOR
ON THE PLANET.

05:00.534 --> 05:01.833
I WAS RIGHT.

05:01.835 --> 05:03.535
IT'S SPECTACULAR.

05:03.537 --> 05:06.305
IT'S-- IT'S GREAT.

05:06.307 --> 05:07.306
THANKS.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.542
CATCH YOU LATER.

05:19.086 --> 05:20.786
SPENCE,
WHY DIDN'T YOUR FOLKS

05:20.788 --> 05:22.754
TAKE YOU TO NEW YORK
WITH YOUR SISTER?

05:22.756 --> 05:25.057
I MEAN, YOU DESERVE
SOME RETAIL THERAPY TOO.

05:25.059 --> 05:26.925
NOT AS MUCH AS MELISSA.

05:26.927 --> 05:29.695
OOH, HOT SCARF, EM.

05:29.697 --> 05:30.662
THANKS.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.164
IS IT NEW?

05:32.166 --> 05:32.998
NO.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
( cell phone ringing )

05:42.543 --> 05:44.876
( ringing continues )

05:44.878 --> 05:46.712
GO AHEAD, ANSWER IT.

05:46.714 --> 05:49.281
WE KNOW WHO IT<i> CAN'T</i>
BE FROM.

05:49.283 --> 05:50.615
HANNA.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.485
IT'S MY DAD!

05:53.487 --> 05:55.721
( chuckles softly )

05:55.723 --> 05:56.788
HEY, DAD.

05:59.727 --> 06:02.260
HAS SHE... EVEN, LIKE,
TALKED TO HER DAD

06:02.262 --> 06:03.762
SINCE HE WALKED OUT
ON THEM?

06:03.764 --> 06:05.030
I DON'T KNOW.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.099
AND THEN, HER FATHER,
IT'S ONE OF THOSE

06:07.101 --> 06:08.934
"DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL"
SITUATIONS.

06:08.936 --> 06:10.736
WE SHOULDN'T
STARE AT HER. COME ON.

06:10.738 --> 06:12.237
( cell phone beeps )

06:12.239 --> 06:14.906
MY BROTHER'S POST
JUST SHOWED UP
ON MY LOOP.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.274
YOU ADDED HIM
AS A FAVORITE?

06:16.276 --> 06:18.110
YEAH. MOMENT OF WEAKNESS.

06:22.483 --> 06:23.682
SORRY.

06:23.684 --> 06:24.950
MY FAULT.

06:28.222 --> 06:30.555
( quietly )
I wonder if we
just bumped into "A."

06:30.557 --> 06:33.892
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
WE'RE DONE WITH "A," RIGHT?

06:33.894 --> 06:35.894
RIGHT. YEAH.

06:35.896 --> 06:39.030
BUT I'M STILL STAYING
OUT OF TOBY'S WAY.

06:39.032 --> 06:40.399
YEAH, AND JENNA'S.

06:40.401 --> 06:44.436
I GUESS THAT'S
THE SAFEST THING TO DO.

06:44.438 --> 06:46.204
<i> THERE WAS NO WAY</i>
<i> I WAS COMING BACK</i>
<i> TO PENNSYLVANIA</i>

06:46.206 --> 06:47.606
<i> AND NOT SEEING YOU,</i>

06:47.608 --> 06:50.075
<i> BUT IF YOU'VE GOT</i>
<i> SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO DO...</i>

06:50.077 --> 06:52.277
NO, DAD,
I HAVEN'T GOT ANYTHING.

06:52.279 --> 06:54.312
<i> THEN I'LL COME BY,</i>
<i> PICK YOU UP AT SEVEN.</i>

06:54.314 --> 06:57.516
<i> HOW'S THAT SOUND?</i>
SOUNDS GREAT.
I'LL TELL MOM.

06:57.518 --> 06:58.950
UM... DAD?

06:58.952 --> 07:00.552
<i> YES?</i>

07:00.554 --> 07:02.320
DID MOM...?

07:02.322 --> 07:04.423
<i> DID YOUR MOM WHAT,</i>
<i> HONEY?</i>

07:04.425 --> 07:07.058
YOU KNOW, NEVER MIND.
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.

07:07.060 --> 07:08.860
<i> BYE.</i>
BYE.

07:15.736 --> 07:16.768
HI.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.305
HI.

07:20.307 --> 07:21.139
I...

07:22.142 --> 07:25.410
I SAW YOU RIDING
AROUND TOWN THE OTHER DAY...

07:25.412 --> 07:26.778
ON YOUR BIKE.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.381
YEAH. I SAW YOU TOO.
I WAVED,

07:29.383 --> 07:30.315
REMEMBER?

07:31.585 --> 07:35.287
I WOULD HAVE STOPPED,
BUT YOU WEREN'T ALONE.

07:35.289 --> 07:38.523
MY FRIENDS THOUGHT
YOU HAD NICE LEGS.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.628
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

07:43.630 --> 07:45.130
THAT I WAS EMBARRASSED

07:45.132 --> 07:47.699
THAT MY FRIENDS THOUGHT
YOU HAD NICE LEGS.

07:49.436 --> 07:53.472
IT'S A LITTLE AWKWARD
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

07:53.474 --> 07:56.208
ARIA, WHAT ARE
THE CIRCUMSTANCES HERE?

07:56.210 --> 07:57.642
IF YOU KNOW,
PLEASE TELL ME

07:57.644 --> 08:00.378
'CAUSE THIS IS COMPLETELY
NEW TERRITORY TO ME.

08:00.380 --> 08:01.980
YEAH, ME TOO.

08:05.052 --> 08:06.718
MAYBE THIS ISN'T SMART.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.620
I PROMISE YOU,
IT'S NOT SMART.

08:11.425 --> 08:13.158
BUT WE NEED TO TALK.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.294
THERE ARE THINGS
WHAT WE NEED TO COVER

08:16.296 --> 08:18.029
THAT WE<i> CAN'T</i>
BETWEEN CLASSES.

08:18.031 --> 08:19.931
UH, I'M HOME TONIGHT.
( locker door closes )

08:19.933 --> 08:22.467
I COULD MAKE YOU
ONE OF TWO DISHES

08:22.469 --> 08:24.936
THAT I ACTUALLY
KNOW HOW TO COOK,

08:24.938 --> 08:27.372
BUT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU

08:27.374 --> 08:29.407
WHEN I'M NOT LOOKING
AT YOU OVER A DESK,

08:29.409 --> 08:31.943
OR THROUGH DAN FARREN'S
FAUX-HAWK.

08:39.953 --> 08:40.952
WHAT TIME?

08:42.189 --> 08:43.221
SEVEN.

08:44.424 --> 08:45.824
SEVEN'S GOOD.

08:50.664 --> 08:53.298
Hanna:<i> HE HAS TO BE</i>
<i> IN NEW ENGLAND FOR</i>
<i> A COUPLE OF WEEKS,</i>

08:53.300 --> 08:55.734
BUT HE'S MAKING A SPECIAL
TRIP OUT TO SEE ME.

08:55.736 --> 08:58.703
THAT'S--
THAT'S GREAT, HANNA.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.906
WHAT?

09:00.908 --> 09:04.976
IT'S JUST... DO YOU THINK
HE'S OUT HERE BECAUSE OF
THE THING WITH SEAN'S CAR?

09:04.978 --> 09:07.812
NO, HE'S NOT.
LOOK, I ASKED.
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

09:07.814 --> 09:09.281
AND BESIDES,
EVEN IF HE WAS,

09:09.283 --> 09:11.750
AT LEAST HE'S STILL
COMING OUT TO SEE ME.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.552
SPENCER!

09:13.554 --> 09:14.719
MR. SHELDRAKE.

09:14.721 --> 09:17.589
I WAS GONNA
TELL YOU IN CLASS,
BUT HERE YOU ARE.

09:17.591 --> 09:20.592
REMARKABLE JOB
ON THE RUSSIAN HISTORY ESSAY.

09:20.594 --> 09:22.494
OH, THANKS.

09:22.496 --> 09:23.962
VERY LUCID PRESENTATION.

09:23.964 --> 09:25.497
IT'S NOT REALLY
A NEW IDEA.

09:25.499 --> 09:27.832
I'VE SUBMITTED IT
FOR THE GOLDEN ORCHID.

09:27.834 --> 09:30.068
YOU WHAT?!
THERE'S AN HONORARIUM.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.837
BUT YOU KNOW
THE REAL UPSIDE TO WINNING
AN ESSAY COMPETITION LIKE THAT

09:32.839 --> 09:34.806
IS HOW IT LOOKS
ON YOUR APPLICATIONS.

09:34.808 --> 09:38.243
WAIT, CAN WE--?
WE'LL DISCUSS
THE DETAILS AFTER CLASS.

09:38.245 --> 09:41.813
WHAT'S A GOLDEN ORCHID?

09:41.815 --> 09:43.181
IT'S A NATIONAL COMPETITION

09:43.183 --> 09:44.482
FOR HISTORICAL WRITING.

09:44.484 --> 09:46.618
MORE ACADEMIC BLING
FOR SPENCER.

09:46.620 --> 09:48.853
( class bell rings )
OKAY, SEE YOU LATER.

10:16.583 --> 10:17.882
HI.

10:17.884 --> 10:18.883
HI.

10:20.854 --> 10:22.520
ARE YOU GONNA BE
IN THIS LAB?

10:22.522 --> 10:24.022
STARTING TODAY.

10:24.024 --> 10:25.256
COOL.

10:32.265 --> 10:34.099
YOU WERE WEARING
A SCARF THIS MORNING.

10:35.869 --> 10:38.169
YEAH, I WAS.

10:38.171 --> 10:39.337
I TOOK IT OFF.

10:39.339 --> 10:40.905
IT LOOKED GOOD ON YOU.

10:40.907 --> 10:42.607
THANKS.

10:53.720 --> 10:56.454
Oh, please, no.
Not here.

10:56.456 --> 10:58.823
Oh, please,
oh, please, oh, please.

11:01.128 --> 11:03.695
SO, I GUESS
WE'RE LAB PARTNERS.

11:03.697 --> 11:05.363
YOU OKAY WITH THAT?

11:05.365 --> 11:06.898
SURE.

11:32.526 --> 11:33.625
HEY.

11:33.627 --> 11:34.959
HI.

11:34.961 --> 11:37.262
CHICKEN-OH-MY-GOSH
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE WEEK?

11:37.264 --> 11:41.399
YEAH, I FELT LIKE MAKING
A LITTLE TREAT FOR YOUR DAD,
SOMETHING SPECIAL.

11:41.401 --> 11:43.234
ARE YOU OKAY
WITH VEGGIE BURGERS?

11:43.236 --> 11:45.804
ACTUALLY, I SAID I'D
HAVE DINNER AT SPENCER'S.

11:45.806 --> 11:47.572
OH. OKAY.

11:47.574 --> 11:49.607
AND MIKE IS
GONNA BE OUT TOO,

11:49.609 --> 11:52.711
SO I GUESS YOUR DAD AND I
WILL HAVE THE PLACE
TO OURSELVES.

11:52.713 --> 11:54.012
THAT'S GREAT.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.248
Alison:<i> ISN'T THAT</i>
<i> YOUR DAD'S CAR?</i>

12:18.572 --> 12:21.239
Alison:<i> YOU SO TOTALLY</i>
<i> HAVE TO TELL HER.</i>

12:21.241 --> 12:23.041
TELL HER WHAT?

12:23.043 --> 12:26.177
ARIA, YOU JUST SAW YOUR DAD
MAKING OUT WITH SOMEONE
WHO IS NOT YOUR MOM.

12:26.179 --> 12:28.546
Y-YOU HAVE TO TELL HER.
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO TELL HER THAT?

12:28.548 --> 12:30.782
I DON'T KNOW, OKAY,
BUT YOU HAVE TO.

12:30.784 --> 12:32.751
( cell phone rings )

12:34.688 --> 12:36.121
( sighs )
IT'S MY DAD.

12:36.123 --> 12:38.189
DON'T ANSWER.
WELL, I HAVE TO!

12:38.191 --> 12:40.158
HE'LL TRY AND TALK YOU
OUT OF TELLING.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.127
YOU CAN'T DO THAT
TO YOUR MOM.

12:43.797 --> 12:45.697
YOU HAVE TO TELL HER,
ARIA,

12:45.699 --> 12:47.532
BEFORE SOMEBODY ELSE DOES.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.134
THEN YOU'LL LOSE
BOTH OF THEM.

12:50.470 --> 12:51.436
God.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.772
<i> ( knife chopping vegetables )</i>

12:59.579 --> 13:00.945
MOM.

13:00.947 --> 13:02.046
YEAH?

13:04.818 --> 13:06.417
CAN I HAVE A CARROT?

13:08.722 --> 13:10.054
SURE.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.092
( snaps carrot )

13:15.862 --> 13:18.496
I WISH I HAD A SISTER
SMART ENOUGH TO STEAL
PAPERS FROM.

13:18.498 --> 13:21.499
USING MELISSA'S PAPER
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
A STOPGAP.

13:21.501 --> 13:24.502
IF I ASK SHELDRAKE
TO WITHDRAW THE ESSAY,
HE'LL KNOW SOMETHING'S WRONG.

13:24.504 --> 13:27.438
SPENCER, WHAT MAKES YOU
SO SURE YOU'RE GOING
TO WIN THE COMPETITION?

13:29.142 --> 13:32.143
OH, RIGHT. I FORGOT.
IT'S IN YOUR DNA.

13:34.881 --> 13:36.214
HERE.

13:36.216 --> 13:37.448
TRY THIS ONE.

13:39.219 --> 13:41.853
THIS HAS TO BE
THE PERFECT OUTFIT.

13:41.855 --> 13:45.023
MY DAD HASN'T SEEN ME
SINCE I LOST THE WEIGHT.

13:45.025 --> 13:46.991
THAT JACKET'S
REALLY NOT YOU.

13:48.795 --> 13:50.061
THEN IT'S PERFECT.

13:51.998 --> 13:53.164
SPENCER.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.933
WHAT?

13:56.136 --> 13:57.569
HAVE YOU PEEKED?

13:57.571 --> 14:01.005
WE BLOCKED WHOEVER IT WAS,
AND THAT'S IT.

14:01.007 --> 14:02.407
UNITED FRONT, REMEMBER?

14:02.409 --> 14:03.508
NO, NO, YEAH, I KNOW.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.510
I JUST WONDERED
IF YOU'D PEEKED.

14:05.512 --> 14:06.344
NO.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.112
YEAH. ME NEITHER.

14:15.655 --> 14:16.588
HEY.

14:16.590 --> 14:18.256
CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SEC?

14:22.762 --> 14:23.962
LOOK.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.698
( chuckles ) OH!

14:26.700 --> 14:29.767
GREAT, YOU FOUND THEM.
WHERE WERE THEY?

14:29.769 --> 14:31.436
IN MY CHEMISTRY BOOK.

14:31.438 --> 14:33.037
DID YOU PUT THEM IN THERE?

14:33.039 --> 14:35.106
JUST TELL ME IF YOU DID.

14:35.108 --> 14:36.574
I WON'T BE ANGRY.

14:36.576 --> 14:38.376
WHAT'S THERE TO BE
ANGRY ABOUT?

14:38.378 --> 14:39.911
I THINK WE LOOK CUTE.

14:39.913 --> 14:41.946
DID YOU PUT THEM
IN MY BOOK?

14:41.948 --> 14:44.082
NO, I DIDN'T.

14:49.189 --> 14:50.955
EMILY...

14:50.957 --> 14:52.357
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

14:52.359 --> 14:55.126
SOMEBODY MUST HAVE
GRABBED THEM AT THE PARTY.

14:55.128 --> 14:57.061
THAT SOMEBODY SAW THESE.

14:57.063 --> 14:58.329
THIS IS US--

14:58.331 --> 15:01.065
YOU AND ME--
KISSING.

15:01.067 --> 15:02.834
UNDERSTAND?

15:04.204 --> 15:05.336
MM-HM.

15:08.708 --> 15:10.475
( sighs )
MAYA.

15:13.213 --> 15:15.146
I HAVE TO GET BACK TO WORK.

15:25.926 --> 15:27.859
( doorbell rings )

15:29.162 --> 15:30.428
( faint chuckle )

15:36.937 --> 15:38.136
HANNA.

15:38.138 --> 15:39.237
Hanna: DAD.

15:41.207 --> 15:43.541
OHH!

15:43.543 --> 15:47.812
OH, MY GOD,
THERE'S BARELY ENOUGH
LEFT OF YOU TO HUG.

15:47.814 --> 15:50.148
I MISSED YOU.
I MISSED YOU TOO.

15:50.150 --> 15:51.849
I'LL GET MY BAG.

15:52.986 --> 15:54.218
HELLO, TOM.

15:54.220 --> 15:56.120
ASHLEY. HOW ARE YOU?

15:56.122 --> 15:57.655
GOOD.

15:57.657 --> 15:59.023
GOOD.

15:59.025 --> 16:00.725
SO, YOU READY TO GO?

16:00.727 --> 16:01.993
YEP.

16:03.263 --> 16:05.530
UH, ASH...

16:05.532 --> 16:07.932
THINK MAYBE WE GOT
OUR WIRES CROSSED
ABOUT TONIGHT.

16:07.934 --> 16:10.134
MY IDEA WAS THAT THIS
WOULD BE A GOOD TIME

16:10.136 --> 16:11.569
FOR ME TO
CATCH UP WITH<i> HANNA.</i>

16:11.571 --> 16:13.137
OH.

16:13.139 --> 16:15.039
I GUESS I MUST HAVE
MISUNDERSTOOD.

16:15.041 --> 16:17.342
MY MISTAKE.

16:17.344 --> 16:18.943
DOES THAT
WORK FOR YOU, HONEY?

16:18.945 --> 16:20.011
JUST YOU AND I TONIGHT?

16:20.013 --> 16:21.145
UM...

16:21.147 --> 16:22.213
YEAH.

16:26.019 --> 16:27.151
OKAY.

16:29.422 --> 16:32.023
NOT TOO LATE, TOM.
SURE.

16:32.025 --> 16:33.491
BYE, MOM.
BYE.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.259
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

16:43.069 --> 16:45.103
Female Vocalist:
<i> ¶ JUST SIT TIGHT ¶</i>

16:45.105 --> 16:50.241
<i> ¶ DON'T YOU EVEN THINK</i>
<i> ABOUT GOING ANYWHERE ¶</i>

16:53.446 --> 16:54.946
THAT'S A NEW CAR,

16:54.948 --> 16:57.248
SO I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND
IF I DRIVE, DO YOU?

17:00.186 --> 17:02.220
HANNA?

17:02.222 --> 17:05.089
THIS IS ABOUT SEAN'S CAR.

17:05.091 --> 17:06.657
MOM DID CALL YOU.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.359
IT'S A LITTLE MORE
COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.628
WELL, LET ME
UNCOMPLICATE IT FOR YOU.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.096
IF YOU CAME HERE
TO YELL AT ME,

17:12.098 --> 17:13.965
LET'S JUST GO BACK INSIDE
AND GET IT OVER WITH.

17:13.967 --> 17:15.733
OR, YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHY DON'T YOU YELL
AT ME RIGHT HERE

17:15.735 --> 17:18.336
SO ALL THE NEIGHBORS
CAN WATCH ME TAKE
MY MEDICINE?

17:18.338 --> 17:20.304
I DIDN'T COME BACK
TO YELL AT ANYBODY.

17:20.306 --> 17:22.607
I CAME BACK TO HELP YOU
THROUGH A ROUGH SPOT.

17:22.609 --> 17:25.743
YOU'RE A GOOD GIRL, HANNA.
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN A GOOD GIRL.

17:25.745 --> 17:28.813
YOU CAN GET A LITTLE...
OVERENTHUSIASTIC.

17:28.815 --> 17:30.648
I REMEMBER YOU
AS A GREAT TREE-CLIMBER.

17:30.650 --> 17:33.484
THE PROBLEM WAS,
YOU'D SOMETIMES NEED
SOME HELP TO GET BACK DOWN.

17:33.486 --> 17:36.354
WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS.

17:36.356 --> 17:37.588
I PROMISE.

17:39.826 --> 17:41.826
NOW, IF YOU WANT
TO GO TO DINNER,
WE CAN GO TO DINNER.

17:41.828 --> 17:44.162
IF YOU WANT TO GO TO
THE SHOOTING GALLERY
OF THE JOLLY ROGER,

17:44.164 --> 17:45.530
WE CAN DO THAT.

17:45.532 --> 17:47.498
WHATEVER YOU WANT.
'KAY?

17:52.806 --> 17:54.005
YEAH. OKAY.

17:58.912 --> 17:59.811
MISS.

Male Vocalist:
<i> ¶ WHEN I'M 21 ¶</i>

<i> ¶ SHE'LL BE 35 ¶</i>

<i> ¶ BUT I DON'T MIND ¶</i>

( keys clacking )
( chuckling )

18:17.197 --> 18:19.330
DO YOU<i> USE</i> THIS?

18:19.332 --> 18:22.300
AS A PAPERWEIGHT.
( clears throat )

18:22.302 --> 18:27.972
MOSTLY IT'S TO REMIND MYSELF
THAT THERE WAS LITERATURE
BEFORE LAPTOPS.

18:27.974 --> 18:29.006
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

18:29.008 --> 18:30.408
IT'S NICE.

18:30.410 --> 18:33.144
YEAH, I LIKE IT.
THANKS FOR ASKING ME.

18:33.146 --> 18:35.546
YOU'RE WELCOME.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.148
HOW ARE THINGS AT HOME?

18:37.150 --> 18:39.550
( sighs )
FINE.

18:39.552 --> 18:42.553
UM... MY MOM AND DAD
ARE HAVING A DATE NIGHT.

18:42.555 --> 18:45.423
MM. WELL, MAYBE THEY'RE
WORKING THINGS OUT.

18:45.425 --> 18:48.392
THEY CAN HAVE ALL
THE ALONE TIME IN THE WORLD,

18:48.394 --> 18:50.761
BUT SHE'S...

18:50.763 --> 18:53.097
SHE'S GONNA BE MISERABLE
WHEN SHE FINDS OUT.

18:53.099 --> 18:54.098
ARIA,

18:54.100 --> 18:55.867
HAS IT EVER OCCURRED TO YOU

18:55.869 --> 18:58.002
THAT MAYBE YOUR MOM
KNOWS MORE ABOUT THIS
THAN YOU THINK?

18:58.004 --> 19:02.039
NO. SHE DOESN'T KNOW.
THAT'S THE WORST PART.

19:02.041 --> 19:03.875
WELL, ALMOST THE WORST PART.

19:03.877 --> 19:05.877
WELL, IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT YOUR PARENTS HAVE COME

19:05.879 --> 19:08.146
TO SOME SORT OF UNDERSTANDING
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT.

19:08.148 --> 19:10.815
NO, IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

19:10.817 --> 19:13.251
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
AN "UNDERSTANDING"?

19:13.253 --> 19:15.553
OKAY, UM...

19:15.555 --> 19:18.456
WHEN I WAS 12,
MY PARENTS BROKE UP,

19:18.458 --> 19:20.958
AND IT THREW MY BROTHER
AND ME FOR A LOOP.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.728
I FOUND OUT LATER
THEY'D BOTH BEEN CHEATING.

19:23.730 --> 19:26.564
THEY WORKED THROUGH
THEIR INFIDELITY,

19:26.566 --> 19:28.566
IT WAS JUST SOMETHING ELSE
THAT KILLED THE MARRIAGE.

19:28.568 --> 19:30.501
BUT THAT'S<i> YOUR</i> FAMILY,
NOT MINE.

19:33.173 --> 19:34.572
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO TELL ME?

19:34.574 --> 19:36.040
I'M JUST SAYING

19:36.042 --> 19:38.442
THAT EVEN THOUGH YOUR DAD
PUT YOU IN THIS POSITION,

19:38.444 --> 19:39.977
IT'S NOT
YOUR PROBLEM TO FIX.

19:39.979 --> 19:42.680
I'M NOT TRYING TO FIX IT.
I'M TRYING TO DEAL WITH IT.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.716
BUT THEY ARE THE ONES THAT
SHOULD BE DEALING WITH THIS.

19:45.718 --> 19:47.552
WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE NOW
IS THAT YOUR PARENTS

19:47.554 --> 19:50.154
NEED TO FIGURE IT OUT
FOR THEMSELVES, LIKE ADULTS.

19:50.156 --> 19:51.822
LIKE ADULTS?
RIGHT.

19:51.824 --> 19:55.426
LIKE I'M NOT MATURE ENOUGH
TO DEAL WITH THIS?

19:55.428 --> 19:57.161
I-I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

19:57.163 --> 19:59.197
YEAH, I THINK THAT'S
<i> EXACTLY</i> WHAT YOU SAID.

19:59.199 --> 20:02.967
YOU SAID I AM A CHILD
AND I SHOULD MIND
MY OWN BUSINESS.

20:02.969 --> 20:05.069
I GUARANTEE YOU
THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID.

20:05.071 --> 20:08.372
WELL, IF I'M SUCH A CHILD,
WHY DID YOU ASK ME HERE?

20:08.374 --> 20:11.375
I ASKED YOU HERE
BECAUSE

20:11.377 --> 20:13.611
I DON'T SEE YOU
AS A CHILD,

20:13.613 --> 20:15.846
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHY
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT

20:15.848 --> 20:17.315
WHAT'S GOING ON
BETWEEN US.

20:17.317 --> 20:19.850
OKAY. JUST LEAVE
MY PARENTS OUT OF IT.

20:19.852 --> 20:22.119
YOU CAME TO ME
ABOUT YOUR FATHER.
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?

20:23.923 --> 20:24.922
HM?

20:28.661 --> 20:30.795
( huffs )
YOU KNOW, I, UM...

20:30.797 --> 20:32.897
I THINK I MADE
A MISTAKE COMING HERE.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.465
I DON'T THINK YOU DID.

20:34.467 --> 20:35.866
I DO.

20:35.868 --> 20:38.703
IT'S NOT SOMETHING
AN ADULT WOULD HAVE DONE.

20:48.715 --> 20:50.348
IT-- IT WAS GREAT.

20:50.350 --> 20:51.816
INCREDIBLE, REALLY.

20:51.818 --> 20:53.517
WHERE'D YOUR DAD TAKE YOU?

20:53.519 --> 20:55.353
JOLLY ROGER'S.

20:55.355 --> 20:57.088
WHAT, THE LAME
AMUSEMENT PARK?

20:57.090 --> 20:58.656
OKAY,
IT IS NOT LAME.

20:58.658 --> 21:00.424
WE DIDN'T GO
ON THE TILT-A-WHIRL.

21:00.426 --> 21:02.593
WE WALKED AROUND
AND TALKED.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.029
AND I TOLD HIM
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON.

21:07.233 --> 21:11.269
<i> SOME</i> OF WHAT WAS GOING ON,
AND HE LISTENED.

21:11.271 --> 21:13.938
HE WANTS TO TAKE ME
TO A REAL DINNER TONIGHT.

21:13.940 --> 21:16.674
HE SAID HE HAS
SOMETHING TO TELL ME.

21:16.676 --> 21:19.610
I DON'T KNOW,
I THINK HE WANTS TO
SPEND MORE TIME WITH ME.

21:19.612 --> 21:22.213
I MEAN, MAYBE
SUMMERS IN MARYLAND.

21:22.215 --> 21:23.514
SERIOUSLY?

21:23.516 --> 21:24.882
WOULD YOU GO?

21:24.884 --> 21:26.450
WELL, I WOULDN'T
MOVE AWAY,

21:26.452 --> 21:28.085
NOT FOREVER.

21:28.087 --> 21:30.721
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE
MY MOM ALONE, BUT...

21:30.723 --> 21:32.823
I WOULD LIKE
TO SEE MY DAD MORE.

21:32.825 --> 21:34.325
WOW.

21:34.327 --> 21:36.394
GOOD FOR YOU.

21:36.396 --> 21:37.628
( class bell rings )

21:47.307 --> 21:49.240
( clears throat )

21:49.242 --> 21:50.675
I'M WONDERING,

21:50.677 --> 21:54.078
IS ANYBODY ELSE BOTHERED
BY ATTICUS' HYPOCRISY

21:54.080 --> 21:55.913
AT THE END OF THE NOVEL?

21:55.915 --> 21:58.349
NO? WELL,
HE'S MR. DUE PROCESS

21:58.351 --> 22:00.017
WHEN IT COMES
TO TOM ROBINSON,

22:00.019 --> 22:02.053
THEN AS SOON AS
BOB EWELL GETS STABBED,

22:02.055 --> 22:03.921
HE'S WILLING TO BUY
INTO THE SHERIFF'S COVER-UP.

22:03.923 --> 22:06.290
HE WAS PROTECTING
BOO RADLEY.

22:06.292 --> 22:07.625
PROTECTING HIM?

22:07.627 --> 22:09.460
FROM WHAT,
THE JUSTICE SYSTEM?

22:09.462 --> 22:11.495
ATTICUS IS AN OFFICER
OF THE COURT,

22:11.497 --> 22:13.864
AND HE'S CONSPIRING
TO COVER UP A CRIME.

22:13.866 --> 22:15.866
AND HE'S WILLING TO LET
HIS OWN SON TAKE THE FALL

22:15.868 --> 22:17.335
FOR SOMETHING
THAT BOO RADLEY DID?

22:17.337 --> 22:18.336
IT WAS A TRADE.

22:18.338 --> 22:19.670
WHAT WAS A TRADE?

22:19.672 --> 22:21.572
MR. EWELL WOULD HAVE
KILLED THOSE KIDS.

22:21.574 --> 22:23.174
BOO SAVED THEM.

22:23.176 --> 22:27.845
AND ATTICUS WAS
STILL FEELING GUILTY
OVER TOM ROBINSON, SO...

22:27.847 --> 22:30.314
HE OFFERED JEM
TO TAKE BOO'S PLACE,

22:30.316 --> 22:31.882
ALMOST LIKE A SACRIFICE.

22:31.884 --> 22:33.184
OH. VERY NOBLE.

22:33.186 --> 22:34.952
TOO BAD JEM WAS UNCONSCIOUS.

22:34.954 --> 22:37.121
YOU THINK HE MIGHT HAVE
HAD A DIFFERENT OPINION?

22:37.123 --> 22:39.256
NO, JEM WOULD HAVE SAID YES.
YOU'RE SURE ABOUT THAT?

22:39.258 --> 22:41.225
HE WAS BROUGHT UP RIGHT.

22:45.965 --> 22:47.898
( clears throat )

22:47.900 --> 22:51.102
I'M SORRY, MR. SPERLING,
DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO ADD
TO THE DISCUSSION,

22:51.104 --> 22:52.937
ASIDE FROM PHLEGM?

22:52.939 --> 22:54.271
JUST...

22:54.273 --> 22:56.073
WELL, HIS DAD WAS A LAWYER.

22:56.075 --> 22:57.942
HE COULD GET THE KID OFF.

22:57.944 --> 23:01.045
UM... BEING BROUGHT UP RIGHT
HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

23:01.047 --> 23:02.213
REALLY?

23:02.215 --> 23:04.048
THE WHOLE BOOK IS ABOUT
WHAT SHAPES US INTO ADULTS,

23:04.050 --> 23:05.783
OR HAVEN'T YOU BEEN
PAYING ATTENTION?

23:05.785 --> 23:07.551
I'M JUST SAYING
THAT SHE--

23:07.553 --> 23:09.520
YOU'RE JUST SAYING
THAT ARIA MADE AN ATTEMPT
TO UNDERSTAND THIS BOOK

23:09.522 --> 23:10.855
AND YOU HAVEN'T.

23:12.592 --> 23:14.992
NO, I WASN'T SAYING THAT,
MR. FITZ.

23:17.630 --> 23:19.597
SORRY. WHAT<i> ARE</i>
YOU TRYING TO SAY?

23:19.599 --> 23:23.701
WELL, IT'D PROBABLY
BE EASIER FOR ATTICUS
TO GET THE KID OFF

23:23.703 --> 23:25.636
THAN TO GET BOO OFF,
THAT'S ALL.

23:34.347 --> 23:36.380
( class bell rings )

23:42.688 --> 23:45.823
( boys laughing )

24:09.081 --> 24:11.715
WELL, I AM HONORED
TO GET YOU TWO NIGHTS
IN A ROW.

24:11.717 --> 24:14.452
YOU THINK SEAN
WILL BE JEALOUS?

24:14.454 --> 24:16.220
I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO SEAN
SINCE THE PARTY.

24:16.222 --> 24:18.222
YEAH, I WAS
WAITING FOR YOU TO SAY
SOMETHING LAST NIGHT

24:18.224 --> 24:19.890
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN YOU TWO.

24:19.892 --> 24:21.859
WELL, I WAS HAVING
TOO MUCH FUN.

24:21.861 --> 24:24.862
I WONDER IF ALL THIS
HAS A LITTLE LESS
TO DO WITH SEAN

24:24.864 --> 24:27.064
AND MORE TO DO
WITH SOMETHING ELSE.

24:27.066 --> 24:28.866
SOMETHING ELSE?

24:28.868 --> 24:31.936
HOW ARE YOU ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED WITH ALISON?

24:31.938 --> 24:34.538
I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN,
SOMETIMES I JUST...

24:34.540 --> 24:36.607
WANT TO GET AWAY.

24:36.609 --> 24:38.576
YOU KNOW,
BE SOMEWHERE ELSE
FOR A WHILE.

24:38.578 --> 24:41.111
SOMEWHERE YOU CAN
CLEAR YOUR HEAD,

24:41.113 --> 24:43.447
MAYBE GET A NEW
PERSPECTIVE ON THINGS?

24:43.449 --> 24:46.016
YEAH, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I MEAN.

24:46.018 --> 24:50.087
HANNA, THERE'S A COUPLE
OF MATTERS THAT WE
HAVE TO DISCUSS.

24:50.089 --> 24:52.890
REALLY? WHAT MATTERS?

24:52.892 --> 24:55.860
HEY. HERE YOU ARE.
Woman: HI.

24:57.363 --> 24:59.063
HI. HEY.

24:59.065 --> 25:03.467
HANNA, THIS IS ISABEL,
MY FIANCéE.

25:03.469 --> 25:05.603
FIANCéE?

25:05.605 --> 25:08.506
I AM SO HAPPY
TO MEET YOU, HANNA.

25:08.508 --> 25:10.074
OHH!

25:10.076 --> 25:12.776
UM, AND THIS IS
ISABEL'S DAUGHTER, KATE.

25:12.778 --> 25:13.944
KATE, THIS IS HANNA.

25:13.946 --> 25:14.845
HANNA.

25:15.815 --> 25:18.048
I, UH, THOUGHT IT WAS
TIME WE ALL MET.

25:21.087 --> 25:23.220
( wind howling )

25:26.726 --> 25:28.759
( glass pane breaks )

25:59.759 --> 26:02.259
( creaking sound )

26:11.938 --> 26:13.404
WHO'S THERE?

26:13.406 --> 26:14.838
( Wren groans )

26:14.840 --> 26:17.374
WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?

26:22.448 --> 26:23.480
Oh.

26:24.617 --> 26:28.319
I PICKED THIS FOR YOU,
FROM THE GARDEN.

26:28.321 --> 26:30.955
WREN, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

26:30.957 --> 26:33.657
I'VE COME HERE
TO SET THINGS RIGHT.

26:33.659 --> 26:35.125
YOU'RE DRUNK.

26:35.127 --> 26:38.462
ONE DOES NOT COME UNFORTIFIED
TO THE HOUSE OF HASTINGS.

26:38.464 --> 26:40.998
WREN, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE AN AXE MURDERER
OR SOMETHING.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.668
I TRIED CALLING YOU,
BUT YOU WERE BLOCKING
MY NUMBER.

26:44.670 --> 26:46.070
N--

26:46.072 --> 26:49.740
OH, NO, I WASN'T
BLOCKING<i> YOU,</i> I JUST...

26:49.742 --> 26:52.309
DID YOU BREAK THROUGH
THE BACK DOOR?

26:52.311 --> 26:55.412
I HAD DIFFICULTY LOCATING
THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE.
I'M SORRY.

26:55.414 --> 26:56.513
WREN.

26:56.515 --> 26:58.549
GO. NOW.

26:58.551 --> 27:01.452
I'VE THOUGHT OF
NOTHING BUT YOU

27:01.454 --> 27:02.920
SINCE YOU CAME TO SEE ME.

27:02.922 --> 27:05.356
I'VE BEEN A COWARD.

27:05.358 --> 27:06.857
BUT THAT ENDS TONIGHT.

27:06.859 --> 27:10.327
I'M HERE TO TAKE
FULL RESPONSIBILITY.

27:10.329 --> 27:11.829
SUMMON YOUR FATHER.

27:11.831 --> 27:13.897
( chuckles )
I'M NOT SUMMONING ANYBODY.

27:13.899 --> 27:16.700
MY PARENTS ARE
IN NEW YORK WITH MELISSA.

27:16.702 --> 27:19.169
THEN I SHALL DEPART.

27:19.171 --> 27:20.571
( gasps )

27:20.573 --> 27:21.905
GREAT!

27:23.342 --> 27:25.576
JUST... OH!

27:25.578 --> 27:26.977
( sighs )

27:26.979 --> 27:28.278
( chuckles )
HELLO!

27:28.280 --> 27:29.380
GREAT!

27:31.150 --> 27:33.684
YOUR FACE

27:33.686 --> 27:35.619
IS VERY FAIR.

27:44.664 --> 27:47.431
HOW 'BOUT SOME BLACK COFFEE?

27:47.433 --> 27:48.966
I'VE BEEN DRINKING SCOTCH.

27:48.968 --> 27:50.601
I'D RATHER NOT
MIX MY BEVERAGES.

27:57.543 --> 27:59.743
SPENCER: Okay,
come on, Wren.

27:59.745 --> 28:02.746
( indistinct chatter )

28:02.748 --> 28:03.881
( Wren laughing )

28:03.883 --> 28:05.549
You scared the hell
out of me.

28:12.725 --> 28:14.124
( knocking )

28:14.126 --> 28:15.659
Vocalist:
<i> ¶ ALL MY FRIENDS... ¶</i>

28:15.661 --> 28:17.995
<i> ( music fades )</i>

28:17.997 --> 28:21.331
OKAY, I HAVE<i> NEVER</i>
BEEN SO EMBARRASSED
IN MY LIFE.

28:21.333 --> 28:23.834
FIRST YOU COMPLAIN
ABOUT ME BEING IMMATURE,

28:23.836 --> 28:25.669
AND THEN YOU ACT
LIKE THAT IN CLASS

28:25.671 --> 28:27.237
LIKE I NEEDED
TO BE PROTECTED.

28:27.239 --> 28:30.207
AND EVERYBODY KNEW
THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING
WEIRD GOING ON.

28:30.209 --> 28:32.276
GOD! WHAT WAS THAT?

28:32.278 --> 28:33.777
WHAT? WHAT, WERE YOU
TRYING TO TEACH ME

28:33.779 --> 28:35.179
SOME KIND OF LESSON
OR SOMETHING?

28:35.181 --> 28:37.314
BECAUSE I TOTALLY
DON'T NEED THAT FROM YOU.

28:37.316 --> 28:39.550
AND YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT MY PARENTS,

28:39.552 --> 28:42.019
SO DON'T SAY THAT THEY HAVE
SOME KIND OF ARRANGEMENT

28:42.021 --> 28:43.620
OR UNDERSTANDING OR SOMETHING,

28:43.622 --> 28:46.356
BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW THEM,
AND YOU DON'T KNOW ME, OKAY?

28:47.727 --> 28:49.493
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

28:50.896 --> 28:52.229
I AM?

28:52.231 --> 28:54.598
I REALLY...

28:54.600 --> 28:56.567
DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT YOU.

29:02.374 --> 29:05.509
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE MESS.

29:05.511 --> 29:08.011
I'LL CLEAN THAT UP LATER.

29:08.013 --> 29:09.780
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT THE GERANIUM.

29:18.290 --> 29:22.926
WHY DO YOU THINK
YOU HAD TO GET DRUNK
TO TALK TO MY FATHER?

29:25.131 --> 29:27.331
FOR MANY COMPLEX
PSYCHOLOGICAL REASONS,

29:27.333 --> 29:30.601
BUT MAINLY BECAUSE HE SCARES
THE VINEGAR OUT OF ME.

29:33.372 --> 29:36.039
HE'S REALLY NOT THAT BAD,

29:36.041 --> 29:37.641
ONCE YOU GET TO KNOW HIM.

29:37.643 --> 29:40.644
THINGS'LL GO
BACK TO NORMAL...

29:40.646 --> 29:42.079
EVENTUALLY.

29:42.081 --> 29:45.916
YEAH. WHAT PASSES
FOR NORMAL AROUND HERE.

29:45.918 --> 29:49.253
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED THINGS
THE WAY THEY WERE.

29:49.255 --> 29:50.554
I GUESS I DO.

29:53.759 --> 29:55.826
I DON'T KNOW.
I'VE NEVER KNOWN
ANYTHING ELSE.

29:57.263 --> 29:59.763
I KNOW I NEVER WANTED
TO HURT MELISSA.

29:59.765 --> 30:01.431
Yeah.

30:01.433 --> 30:05.102
SOMETIMES IT LOOKS LIKE
NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA
BETWEEN US, BUT...

30:07.373 --> 30:08.705
SHE'S MY SISTER.

30:10.676 --> 30:12.109
THAT STILL COUNTS.

30:18.050 --> 30:20.584
WELL, I THINK
I'VE IMPOSED ENOUGH.

30:20.586 --> 30:23.086
UM, YOU CAN'T DRIVE
LIKE THAT.

30:23.088 --> 30:25.222
OH, I'M NOT GOING
ALL THE WAY BACK
TO PHILADELPHIA.

30:25.224 --> 30:27.357
I'VE GOT A ROOM
IN THE EDGEWOOD
MOTOR COURT.

30:28.761 --> 30:30.561
YOU CAN'T DRIVE ANYWHERE.

30:30.563 --> 30:32.663
GIVE ME YOUR KEYS.

30:32.665 --> 30:35.032
COME ON.
TOGETHER. HERE.

30:35.034 --> 30:37.167
( Wren chuckles )

30:37.169 --> 30:39.770
...SO I TURN AROUND,
AND THERE'S JEFF BEHIND ME,

30:39.772 --> 30:42.940
AND HE IS SO FOCUSED
ON BEATING ME

30:42.942 --> 30:46.243
THAT HE FORGETS
TO LIFT THE DAGGERBOARD

30:46.245 --> 30:49.012
AS WE'RE
APPROACHING THE BEACH,

30:49.014 --> 30:50.814
SO HE GETS ALL HUNG UP
IN THE SHALLOWS,

30:50.816 --> 30:53.517
AND I SIMPLY WALK
ONTO THE BEACH AND...

30:53.519 --> 30:54.985
TAKE A BOW.

30:54.987 --> 30:56.854
( soft laughter )

30:58.891 --> 31:00.858
HANNA, DO YOU SAIL?

31:00.860 --> 31:03.126
NO.
OH, YOU SHOULD.

31:03.128 --> 31:05.963
KATE COULD TEACH YOU.
SHE'S A VERY GOOD TEACHER.

31:05.965 --> 31:07.464
ESPECIALLY WITH BEGINNERS.

31:07.466 --> 31:09.666
I THINK IT WOULD BE
SO MUCH FUN FOR BOTH
OF YOU,

31:09.668 --> 31:10.968
GOING OUT TOGETHER
ON A BOAT.

31:10.970 --> 31:13.003
SEEING WHO'S COMING BACK.
( chuckling )

31:14.773 --> 31:17.007
( chuckles softly )
WAS THAT A JOKE?

31:17.009 --> 31:18.475
OF COURSE IT WAS A JOKE.

31:20.346 --> 31:22.446
AND THIS IS A FORK.

31:23.749 --> 31:25.015
JUST SO YOU KNOW, HANNA,

31:25.017 --> 31:26.750
I HAD A CHAT
WITH SEAN'S FATHER,

31:26.752 --> 31:28.185
AND EVERYTHING'S
GONNA WORK OUT.

31:28.187 --> 31:30.554
YOU TALKED TO SEAN'S DAD?
MM-HM.

31:30.556 --> 31:33.824
HE, UH, GAVE ME AN ESTIMATE
ON THE DAMAGE YOU DID
TO HIS CAR,

31:33.826 --> 31:35.459
AND WE AGREED
TO SETTLE THINGS

31:35.461 --> 31:37.461
WITHOUT GETTING
THE INSURANCE COMPANIES
INVOLVED,

31:37.463 --> 31:38.996
SO I'LL WRITE A CHECK,

31:38.998 --> 31:40.998
AND YOU WILL WORK OFF
THE COST OF REPAIRS

31:41.000 --> 31:43.033
IN SEAN'S MOTHER'S OFFICE.

31:43.035 --> 31:45.168
SEAN'S MOTHER IS A DENTIST.

31:45.170 --> 31:47.137
WELL, YOU WON'T BE
DRILLING TEETH.

31:47.139 --> 31:49.907
YOU'LL BE CLEANING UP,
DOING LIGHT CLERICAL WORK,

31:49.909 --> 31:51.308
YOU KNOW, ANSWERING PHONES,

31:51.310 --> 31:53.143
AFTER SCHOOL AND ON WEEKENDS.

31:53.145 --> 31:55.078
THAT COULD BE INTERESTING.

31:55.080 --> 31:59.850
I AM FASCINATED
BY DENTISTRY, AREN'T YOU?

31:59.852 --> 32:02.552
PLAQUE, CAVITIES,
FAKE-LOOKING VENEERS.

32:06.859 --> 32:08.859
( cell phone ringing )

32:08.861 --> 32:09.927
SORRY.

32:29.348 --> 32:30.881
YOU OKAY?

32:30.883 --> 32:32.115
YEAH, I'M FINE.

32:35.020 --> 32:38.889
I MEAN,
AS OKAY AS I CAN BE
TAKING OUT THE GARBAGE.

32:38.891 --> 32:40.324
I KNOW THAT
YOU'RE NOT CRAZY

32:40.326 --> 32:42.726
ABOUT HAVING ME
FOR A LAB PARTNER.

32:42.728 --> 32:43.994
NO.

32:43.996 --> 32:46.129
IT'S OKAY.
I'M COOL WITH THAT.

32:46.131 --> 32:48.765
REALLY? YOU WOULDN'T
SWITCH IF YOU COULD?

32:50.703 --> 32:52.536
I UNDERSTAND.

32:52.538 --> 32:55.172
YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL
WITH WHO YOU GET CLOSE TO.

32:55.174 --> 32:58.141
I KNOW PEOPLE THINK
I'M SOME KIND OF FREAK.

32:58.143 --> 33:00.177
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT.

33:00.179 --> 33:02.846
BUT IT'S GOT TO BOTHER YOU,
IDIOTS RUNNING AROUND,

33:02.848 --> 33:04.748
PUTTING SHAVING CREAM
IN YOUR LOCKER,

33:04.750 --> 33:08.085
LAUGHING AT YOU,
MAKING STUFF UP
ABOUT WHO YOU ARE.

33:08.087 --> 33:10.354
I DIDN'T SAY THAT IT
DOESN'T GET TO ME,

33:10.356 --> 33:12.923
IT'S JUST THAT THERE'S
NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT.

33:12.925 --> 33:15.592
LIKE YOU SAID,
THEY'RE IDIOTS.

33:15.594 --> 33:16.893
SORRY.

33:16.895 --> 33:18.428
YOU NOTICE
HOW MUCH YOU AND I

33:18.430 --> 33:20.197
KEEP SAYING WE'RE SORRY
TO EACH OTHER?

33:20.199 --> 33:22.399
SORRY.
DO YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN?

33:24.636 --> 33:26.536
THAT OTHER DAY IN CHEMISTRY...

33:28.607 --> 33:30.440
THERE WAS SOMETHING
IN MY BOOK.

33:31.877 --> 33:33.543
SOME PICTURES.

33:33.545 --> 33:35.078
DID YOU SEE THEM?

33:36.415 --> 33:38.081
BEFORE I CLOSED MY BOOK,

33:38.083 --> 33:39.850
DID YOU SEE WHAT THEY WERE?

33:39.852 --> 33:42.719
I DON'T THINK YOU WANTED
ANYBODY TO SEE THEM.

33:42.721 --> 33:44.221
I'M COOL WITH THAT.

33:44.223 --> 33:45.589
YOU ARE?

33:48.994 --> 33:50.927
DO YOU STILL SWIM?

33:50.929 --> 33:53.230
YES, I DO.

33:53.232 --> 33:57.567
DO YOU DO IT BECAUSE
PEOPLE ARE WATCHING YOU,

33:57.569 --> 33:59.603
OR BECAUSE YOU LIKE TO SWIM?

33:59.605 --> 34:01.104
I...

34:01.106 --> 34:05.208
DO IT BECAUSE I LOVE
THE WAY IT MAKES ME FEEL.

34:05.210 --> 34:07.210
THEN FORGET
ABOUT THE IDIOTS.

34:07.212 --> 34:10.380
THEY'RE GOING TO SEE
WHAT THEY WANT TO SEE.

34:10.382 --> 34:14.818
EVEN IF YOU COMPLETELY
CHANGED EVERYTHING,

34:14.820 --> 34:17.087
THEY WOULDN'T BE HAPPY.

34:17.089 --> 34:19.823
THEY DON'T WANT YOU
TO CHANGE.

34:19.825 --> 34:22.492
THEY WANT YOU TO GO AWAY.

34:22.494 --> 34:24.628
I TRIED THAT.
I DIDN'T LIKE IT.

34:26.131 --> 34:27.697
AND...

34:27.699 --> 34:28.932
NOW YOU'RE BACK.

34:28.934 --> 34:31.401
YEAH. I AM.

34:34.740 --> 34:36.740
SEE YOU TOMORROW?

34:36.742 --> 34:38.108
TOMORROW.

34:53.692 --> 34:55.492
MM.

34:55.494 --> 34:56.860
YOU'RE LUCKY.

34:56.862 --> 34:58.962
MY COOKING'S ALWAYS
BETTER THE NEXT DAY.

34:58.964 --> 35:01.431
I MAKE REALLY GOOD
LEFTOVERS. DON'T LAUGH.

35:01.433 --> 35:02.933
NO, SERIOUSLY.

35:02.935 --> 35:04.468
THE PESTO WILL
GET UP YOUR NOSE.

35:04.470 --> 35:07.003
WE'LL NEED THE JAWS
OF LIFE IN HERE.

35:07.005 --> 35:10.507
( laughing )

35:10.509 --> 35:14.878
I'M SORRY ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED IN CLASS.

35:14.880 --> 35:16.880
I WAS MAD AT YOU
FOR WALKING OUT OF HERE.

35:16.882 --> 35:19.816
IT'S STUPID, BUT I WAS.

35:19.818 --> 35:23.186
GOING AFTER SPERLING
LIKE THAT,

35:23.188 --> 35:24.988
NOT MY FINEST HOUR
AS A TEACHER.

35:26.191 --> 35:29.159
WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT
ABOUT ME.

35:29.161 --> 35:32.162
I AM A FIXER WHEN IT
COMES TO MY FAMILY.

35:32.164 --> 35:35.632
I'M THE ONE PLANNING
AND NEGOTIATING AND...

35:35.634 --> 35:39.002
JUST TRYING
TO KEEP US TOGETHER
AND KEEP THINGS SOLID.

35:39.004 --> 35:40.971
WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF?

35:40.973 --> 35:42.772
THAT THINGS WILL CHANGE.

35:44.576 --> 35:46.009
BUT...

35:46.011 --> 35:48.979
THAT'S NOT REALLY
HELPING, IS IT?
IT'S JUST...

35:48.981 --> 35:51.548
IT'S JUST TRYING
TO KEEP THINGS FROZEN.

35:51.550 --> 35:54.718
IT'S HUMAN NATURE
TO TRY AND HOLD ON
TO THINGS.

35:54.720 --> 35:56.786
I FEEL LIKE MY AUNT RUTH.

35:56.788 --> 36:01.324
SHE HAD HER PET CAT
STUFFED WHEN HE DIED,

36:01.326 --> 36:03.560
AND YOU'D WALK
IN HER HOUSE, AND...

36:03.562 --> 36:05.529
THERE'S
MUGSY ON THE PIANO.

36:05.531 --> 36:09.199
HE'S THERE,
AND SHE TALKS TO HIM.

36:09.201 --> 36:11.101
THERE'S REALLY
NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE

36:11.103 --> 36:13.170
BETWEEN MUGSY ALIVE
AND MUGSY STUFFED.

36:13.172 --> 36:14.571
I MEAN, HE'S A CAT.

36:14.573 --> 36:16.506
AUNT RUTH,
SHE'S REALLY HAPPY,

36:16.508 --> 36:19.442
BUT... THE REST OF US ARE
JUST KIND OF CREEPED OUT.

36:25.617 --> 36:27.050
I CAN'T FIX THIS.

36:28.987 --> 36:31.421
AND, IF IT'S
GONNA BE FIXED,

36:31.423 --> 36:34.324
THEN THEY'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO DO IT THEMSELVES.

36:34.326 --> 36:37.561
ALL I CAN DO
IS TELL THE TRUTH.

36:37.563 --> 36:39.763
OTHERWISE, I COULD
LOSE THE BOTH OF THEM.

36:43.769 --> 36:45.235
I HAVE TO GO.

36:45.237 --> 36:46.836
DO YOU NEED HELP
CLEANING UP?

36:46.838 --> 36:48.371
UH...

36:50.809 --> 36:53.410
YOU COULD... STAY.

36:55.814 --> 36:57.781
NO, I HAVE TO GO
TALK TO MY MOM.

36:59.751 --> 37:02.052
YOU'RE SURE ABOUT THAT?

37:02.054 --> 37:03.653
YEAH, I'M SURE.

37:08.660 --> 37:10.727
Here.
Oh, thank you.

37:16.001 --> 37:17.634
HOW ARE YOU GONNA GET HOME?

37:17.636 --> 37:19.536
UM...

37:22.608 --> 37:24.007
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

37:28.213 --> 37:29.446
I WAS TELLING THE TRUTH.

37:31.216 --> 37:33.283
ABOUT WISHING
I'D MET YOU FIRST.

37:53.538 --> 37:55.705
COME INSIDE.

37:55.707 --> 37:59.042
( chuckles softly )
I'VE DONE SOME PRETTY
STUPID THINGS LATELY.

37:59.044 --> 38:01.645
I'M WAY OVER MY LIMIT.

38:03.649 --> 38:05.081
GOOD NIGHT, SPENCER.

38:05.083 --> 38:06.683
BYE, WREN.

38:11.223 --> 38:13.390
Female Vocalist:
<i> ¶ ASHAMED OF MYSELF... ¶</i>

38:13.392 --> 38:15.258
Female Deejay:
<i> AND FROM THE REQUEST LINE,</i>

38:15.260 --> 38:17.327
<i> THIS NEXT ONE</i>
<i> GOES OUT TO HANNA,</i>

38:17.329 --> 38:19.763
<i> FROM HER BEST FRIEND, "A."</i>

38:19.765 --> 38:21.264
<i> HERE YOU GO, HANNA.</i>

38:21.266 --> 38:23.333
<i> "WHO'S MY DADDY?"</i>

38:23.335 --> 38:26.936
Female Vocalist:
<i> ¶ WHO IS MY DADDY? ¶</i>

38:26.938 --> 38:28.772
<i> ¶ HOW CAN I TELL HER ¶</i>

38:28.774 --> 38:32.275
<i> ¶ THAT MOMMY'S</i>
<i> BEEN NAUGHTY? ¶</i>

38:32.277 --> 38:34.277
<i> ¶ I DON'T KNOW... ¶</i>

38:34.279 --> 38:37.714
OKAY, WHATEVER
YOU'RE THINKING,

38:37.716 --> 38:39.849
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

38:39.851 --> 38:41.318
HANNA.

38:43.221 --> 38:45.522
WE ARE<i> SO</i> OUT OF OUR LEAGUE.

38:45.524 --> 38:47.290
<i> ¶ WHO'S MY DADDY? ¶</i>

38:47.292 --> 38:49.526
<i> ¶ MY MAMA SAY</i>
<i> HE WENT TO JAIL ¶</i>

38:49.528 --> 38:51.361
<i> ¶ MY BROTHER SAY... ¶</i>

38:53.598 --> 38:54.898
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

38:58.870 --> 39:00.570
HI.

39:00.572 --> 39:03.106
DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M
SUPPOSED TO DO RIGHT NOW,

39:03.108 --> 39:04.974
HUG YOU OR SHAKE HANDS?

39:04.976 --> 39:09.112
I MEAN, THERE MIGHT BE
ALL SORTS OF SECURITY
CAMERAS AROUND.

39:13.852 --> 39:15.085
SORRY.

39:15.087 --> 39:16.886
DON'T SAY THAT.

39:16.888 --> 39:19.022
YOU HAVE...

39:19.024 --> 39:21.124
EVERY RIGHT
TO BE MAD AT ME.

39:21.126 --> 39:22.792
I'M NOT MAD AT YOU.

39:22.794 --> 39:25.528
I WAS WRONG TO JUMP ON YOU
ABOUT THE PICTURES.

39:25.530 --> 39:28.665
IS THIS ABOUT
THE PICTURES, OR...

39:30.702 --> 39:32.669
IS IT ABOUT THE KISS?

39:32.671 --> 39:34.537
I LIKED THE KISS,

39:34.539 --> 39:37.440
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT KISS MEANS.

39:37.442 --> 39:42.912
YOU SPEND TOO MUCH TIME
THINKING ABOUT WHAT
THINGS MEAN--

39:42.914 --> 39:45.882
A KISS, A PICTURE,

39:45.884 --> 39:47.317
A SCARF.

39:47.319 --> 39:51.588
THERE'S SO MUCH GOING ON
IN MY HEAD RIGHT NOW.

39:51.590 --> 39:54.958
I'M JUST
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

39:54.960 --> 39:56.793
WHAT DO YOU NEED,

39:56.795 --> 39:58.328
RIGHT NOW?

39:58.330 --> 40:01.364
A LITTLE TIME.
SOME SPACE.

40:03.668 --> 40:07.771
NOT JUST WITH YOU,
BUT WITH MY MOM,
WITH EVERYBODY.

40:10.375 --> 40:12.909
WE CAN GET SOME SPACE HERE.

40:12.911 --> 40:14.444
IT'S OKAY.

40:15.781 --> 40:17.180
THANKS.

40:19.017 --> 40:20.250
GOOD NIGHT.

40:27.325 --> 40:28.825
I CARE ABOUT YOU.

40:30.729 --> 40:32.862
SO I'LL WAIT.

40:32.864 --> 40:35.064
YOU DON'T...

40:35.066 --> 40:37.901
NEED TO SAY ANYTHING.

40:37.903 --> 40:40.236
YOU JUST NEED TO KNOW THAT.

40:54.820 --> 40:57.520
( door opens, closes )

41:01.460 --> 41:02.692
MOM?

41:02.694 --> 41:04.194
MOM.

41:04.196 --> 41:06.296
I HAVE TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

41:06.298 --> 41:08.298
IT'S IMPORTANT.

41:08.300 --> 41:10.300
THERE'S, UM...

41:10.302 --> 41:12.135
THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

41:16.475 --> 41:17.474
MOM?

41:37.462 --> 41:39.395
<i> WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO</i>
<i> ABOUT "A"?</i>

41:39.397 --> 41:42.332
I MEAN, HE OR SHE
OR IT HASN'T STOPPED.

41:42.334 --> 41:45.201
THEY'RE CALLING
RADIO STATIONS,
MAKING DEDICATIONS.

41:45.203 --> 41:46.736
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

41:46.738 --> 41:47.770
I DON'T KNOW, HANNA.

41:47.772 --> 41:49.639
WELL, IT WAS<i> YOUR</i> IDEA
TO SHUT HER OUT.

41:49.641 --> 41:51.241
AND EVERYBODY
WENT ALONG WITH IT.

41:51.243 --> 41:53.142
UNITED WE STAND. GREAT.

41:55.981 --> 41:57.780
Spencer.

41:59.718 --> 42:01.751
SOMEBODY'S
BEEN IN THE HOUSE.

42:01.753 --> 42:03.186
ALISON'S BRACELET!

42:15.233 --> 42:16.566
( both gasp )

42:27.078 --> 42:29.112
( cell phone rings )

42:36.221 --> 42:38.421
( cell phone rings )

42:52.103 --> 42:53.570
IS THAT JUNGLE RED?

42:55.407 --> 42:56.639
ALISON'S COLOR.

43:07.218 --> 43:09.218
( clock ticking )

43:13.992 --> 43:15.992
( ticking continues )

43:15.994 --> 43:17.160
( clock chimes )

43:18.730 --> 43:19.696
( chime )

43:21.700 --> 43:22.999
( chime )

43:28.873 --> 43:30.974
( clock ticking )

43:35.213 --> 43:37.013
( ticking continues )
