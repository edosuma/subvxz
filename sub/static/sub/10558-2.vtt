00:43.613 --> 00:46.833
Come Thursday,
it's us against Station Five.

00:46.833 --> 00:49.093
And what are we going to do, men?

00:49.093 --> 00:51.753
ALL: Win! And why do we have
to win the police games?

00:51.753 --> 00:53.773
To win the grand prize, sir.
No, Crabtree.

00:53.773 --> 00:58.533
But, sir, the grand prize this year
is a year's supply
of very high quality suspenders.

00:58.533 --> 01:01.413
Higgins and I have been
tackling the greased pig event.

01:01.413 --> 01:03.013
We've been practising
on a large ham.

01:03.013 --> 01:05.833
George, I'm afraid that event's
been cancelled this year,

01:05.833 --> 01:08.453
it's not very humane. Oh!

01:08.453 --> 01:10.153
Waste of a ham.

01:10.153 --> 01:12.193
Hams, actually.

01:12.193 --> 01:16.513
Gentlemen, the police games are
about camaraderie and sportsmanship.

01:16.513 --> 01:18.753
Right, Murdoch,
and after Station Five wins again

01:18.753 --> 01:22.313
we'll all join hands and sing
Pop Goes The Hairy bloody Weasel(!)

01:22.313 --> 01:23.713
What's wrong with you men?

01:23.713 --> 01:28.273
We may call it the Police Games,
but this is about honour, dignity.

01:28.273 --> 01:30.233
About who we are as policemen.

01:30.233 --> 01:32.093
Who we are as men.
TELEPHONE RINGS

01:32.093 --> 01:34.593
Now, everybody listen carefully.

01:34.593 --> 01:37.413
Murdoch has devised a strategy
for the tug of war.

01:37.413 --> 01:39.013
Detective, the floor is yours.

01:39.013 --> 01:41.153
Right. It's quite simple, really.

01:41.153 --> 01:43.833
The physics of opposing force.

01:43.833 --> 01:49.413
Excuse me, Sir. There's been a
murder at George Street and Queen,
but they're asking for you.

01:49.413 --> 01:51.513
That's Station Five's district.

02:06.313 --> 02:09.393
Davis, what's going on?

02:09.393 --> 02:10.693
Where's Detective Slorach?

02:10.693 --> 02:12.313
He's fallen ill with the mumps.

02:12.313 --> 02:15.173
We'll need every hand on deck
to catch the ... who did this.

02:15.173 --> 02:18.713
Did what? Took down one of my men.

02:22.973 --> 02:27.433
Sir, that's Constable Cooper.
Bloody hell.

02:34.853 --> 02:36.873
Detective Murdoch is all yours,
Davis.

02:36.873 --> 02:40.453
We're glad to have you, Detective.
You've quite a reputation.

02:40.453 --> 02:45.933
I'd like to start by speaking with
your constables, in particular those
who knew Constable Cooper well.

02:45.933 --> 02:47.693
Of course.

02:47.693 --> 02:51.073
Townsend, Holder.

02:51.073 --> 02:54.093
You'll be assisting
Detective Murdoch.

02:54.093 --> 02:55.673
Brackenreid, a word.

02:58.273 --> 03:00.253
Detective. Randall Townsend.

03:00.253 --> 03:03.373
Detective, Pete Holder.

03:03.373 --> 03:05.733
When was the last time
you saw Constable Cooper?

03:05.733 --> 03:08.293
Yesterday afternoon.

03:08.293 --> 03:12.333
Cooper was supposed to head over to
Bruiser's Freehouse after his shift

03:12.333 --> 03:14.073
but he never made it.

03:14.073 --> 03:16.633
Any idea why he ended
up in Chinatown instead?

03:16.633 --> 03:18.733
No, sir. Not at all.

03:18.733 --> 03:20.313
That's what's strange.

03:20.313 --> 03:25.393
This may be our beat, Detective,
but we don't necessarily go out
of our way to mix with the Chinee.

03:25.393 --> 03:28.873
Frankly, sir,
they give us the creeps.
And you should see what they eat.

03:28.873 --> 03:31.833
We'll continue this in a moment.

03:33.993 --> 03:35.773
Any preliminary thoughts, Doctor?

03:35.773 --> 03:37.413
Based on the stage of rigamortis

03:37.413 --> 03:39.673
I'd say he was
killed six to eight hours ago.

03:39.673 --> 03:42.053
So late last night
or early this morning?

03:42.053 --> 03:45.193
Yes. His jaw is broken
and there is bruising to the face.

03:45.193 --> 03:46.873
He was in a scrap, then.

03:46.873 --> 03:49.793
It appears so.
And the cause of death?

03:49.793 --> 03:52.893
There's a deep gash in his right
thigh caused by something jagged.

03:52.893 --> 03:57.793
Judging by the amount of blood, I'd
say the femoral artery was severed.

03:57.793 --> 04:01.153
I'll try to get some results as soon
as possible. Davis? Thank you.

04:02.753 --> 04:05.433
We need to get any background
on Cooper you may have.

04:05.433 --> 04:07.473
I'll make sure
it's sent over to you.

04:07.473 --> 04:11.073
Mr Townsend, Mr Holder.

04:11.073 --> 04:13.533
Sir?
Did Constable Cooper have a watch?

04:13.533 --> 04:15.853
Yes, a gift from Coop's grandfather.

04:15.853 --> 04:17.413
Engraved and everything.

04:17.413 --> 04:21.413
Damn these thieving slants.
Excuse me, Sir,

04:21.413 --> 04:23.913
I found these back in the alley.

04:23.913 --> 04:27.233
Do you think they could
have caused the injury? Possibly.

04:27.233 --> 04:30.073
Put them in an evidence bag
please, George. Sir.

04:30.073 --> 04:32.153
How are the boys faring
with the potential witnesses?

04:32.153 --> 04:39.373
Detective, you won't hear nothin'
but Ching Chong this and
Ching Chong that from this bunch.

04:39.373 --> 04:41.613
That's Cantonese, Constable.

04:41.613 --> 04:45.393
Cantonese. As you say, Detective.

04:51.793 --> 04:54.893
All you've got is a missing watch

04:54.893 --> 04:57.793
and some bits of broken glass?

04:57.793 --> 05:01.413
So far, Sir. With Doctor Ogden's
results still to come.

05:01.413 --> 05:04.673
Well, you've got to do better
than that, gentlemen and in a hurry.

05:04.673 --> 05:08.593
I mean what could be more
terrifying to the common citizen

05:08.593 --> 05:11.853
than a member of the Constabulary
attacked by some savage?

05:11.853 --> 05:15.033
A savage, Sir? Someone dangerous...
Chief Constable Stockton,

05:15.033 --> 05:17.833
this killer is not going
to slip away from us.

05:17.833 --> 05:21.253
Over 250 men
on the force will see to that.

05:21.253 --> 05:23.153
Of course they will.

05:25.313 --> 05:27.913
You'll forgive me.

05:27.913 --> 05:30.333
I'm taking this death personally.

05:30.333 --> 05:32.653
As are we, Sir.

05:32.653 --> 05:34.193
No way to parse it, gentlemen.

05:36.073 --> 05:37.893
I want a quick arrest.

05:37.893 --> 05:40.433
And you'll have it, Sir.

05:40.433 --> 05:42.073
Detective.

05:46.333 --> 05:48.953
Sir, promising a quick arrest.

05:48.953 --> 05:52.613
It's not a promise, Murdoch,
it's an imperative.

05:52.613 --> 05:54.053
Now get to it.

05:58.473 --> 06:03.973
I went through Constable Cooper's
notebook. I found this entry.
Made yesterday morning.

06:03.973 --> 06:07.133
"Edward Chen, 7pm."

06:07.133 --> 06:08.953
Who's Edward Chen?

06:08.953 --> 06:11.173
According to Townsend
at Station Five

06:11.173 --> 06:15.073
he's a Chinaman who runs
a coolie brokering business
down on Queen and Jarvis.

06:16.733 --> 06:21.093
I am a businessman. I pay the head
tax to bring people over from China.

06:21.093 --> 06:24.933
For a hefty fee.
I'm allowed a profit, am I not?

06:24.933 --> 06:27.933
You had a meeting with
Constable Cooper at seven o'clock.

06:27.933 --> 06:31.433
What of it? That same constable
was murdered last night.

06:31.433 --> 06:34.513
This was not my doing.

06:34.513 --> 06:36.573
What happened to your eye?

06:36.573 --> 06:40.233
It got in the way
of your Constable Cooper's fist.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.033
There was an altercation?

06:42.033 --> 06:44.293
Strictly one-sided, I assure you.

06:44.293 --> 06:45.893
What was it about?

06:45.893 --> 06:49.173
A private matter.

06:49.173 --> 06:51.113
Misunderstanding, really.

06:53.553 --> 06:56.713
Mr Chen, you are trying my patience.

07:02.013 --> 07:05.093
If you are going to hit me -
please...

07:05.093 --> 07:08.613
You can tell me what the two of you
fought over here.

07:08.613 --> 07:10.873
Or I can hold you at the station.

07:10.873 --> 07:13.913
Of course that may take a few days,
but I'm sure your associates

07:13.913 --> 07:17.273
can take care of your business
in the interim.

07:21.793 --> 07:25.093
It was regarding a girl named Mei-Li.

07:25.093 --> 07:29.833
What about her? For that you'll have
to ask her grandfather. Feng Choy.

07:29.833 --> 07:32.073
His shop is just over there.

08:07.153 --> 08:09.113
Ginseng.

08:10.993 --> 08:12.973
An effective tonic for headaches.

08:12.973 --> 08:14.833
If you prefer, there is opium.

08:14.833 --> 08:16.513
Are you Mei-Li?

08:18.093 --> 08:19.753
No, I am Ling.

08:19.753 --> 08:22.893
Mei-Li is my uncle's granddaughter.

08:22.893 --> 08:24.453
Is his name Feng Choy?

08:24.453 --> 08:26.193
Yes.

08:27.833 --> 08:30.053
My name is
Detective William Murdoch,

08:30.053 --> 08:32.193
with the Toronto Constabulary.
BELLS JINGLE

08:32.193 --> 08:34.313
I'd like
to ask him a few questions.

08:34.313 --> 08:36.553
Oh, he doesn't speak any English.

08:37.793 --> 08:40.553
We saw you come in.

08:40.553 --> 08:44.433
So, what d'you learn from Chen?

08:44.433 --> 08:47.553
Not much. That's no surprise.

08:47.553 --> 08:50.573
These people don't talk without
a little bare knuckle persuasion.

08:50.573 --> 08:53.213
Even guys like Chen.

08:53.213 --> 08:55.633
He may dress in tweed
but it shows through.

08:57.233 --> 08:59.513
Do either of you know of a Mei-Li?

09:01.293 --> 09:03.453
All the names sound the same to me.

09:07.073 --> 09:11.513
Mr Choy. I'd like to ask you
a few questions about Mei-Li.

09:11.513 --> 09:14.253
SHE SPEAKS IN CANTONESE

09:14.253 --> 09:16.593
Mei-Li not here.

09:16.593 --> 09:17.913
Where is she?

09:19.593 --> 09:21.793
Oi! The man's asked you a question.

09:21.793 --> 09:25.253
You answer him. That's quite enough,
Constable, thank you.

09:25.253 --> 09:28.273
It's the only way to get
through to these people, Sir.

09:28.273 --> 09:31.133
I'll handle this.

09:42.553 --> 09:45.593
Mr Choy,
I need to speak with Mei-Li.

09:47.853 --> 09:50.393
You take, go.

09:50.393 --> 09:53.833
Are you are attempting
to bribe me, sir?

09:53.833 --> 09:56.873
Please.
He told you, Mei-Li is not here.

10:01.953 --> 10:04.753
How much for the ginseng?
Nothing, take it.

10:04.753 --> 10:07.213
How much do you charge
your customers?

10:07.213 --> 10:08.793
Five cents.

10:14.473 --> 10:16.433
Five cents.

10:16.433 --> 10:18.273
When Mei-Li returns...

10:20.313 --> 10:22.493
..please ask her
to drop by the station.

10:26.033 --> 10:27.513
Thank you.

10:32.661 --> 10:34.501
The morgue is being guarded?

10:34.501 --> 10:36.521
The audacity of
reporters is astounding.

10:36.521 --> 10:40.081
I caught one trying to
sneak in for a photograph.
The nerve of some people.

10:40.081 --> 10:41.821
Have you something for me, Doctor?

10:41.821 --> 10:43.721
More questions, I'm afraid.

10:43.721 --> 10:46.901
Such as, why kill someone by
severing their femoral artery?

10:46.901 --> 10:52.341
What's this? Speaking of strange,
it's a discontinuous bruise
running around the upper thigh.

10:52.341 --> 10:54.341
And then there are these -

10:54.341 --> 10:58.421
glass fragments
I found buried in the wound.

10:58.421 --> 11:02.501
We found broken bottles
in the alley. They may have
come from Feng Choy's shop.

11:02.501 --> 11:06.361
And then there are these,
dark fibres also from the wound.

11:06.361 --> 11:07.941
But I've yet to identify them.

11:10.161 --> 11:12.801
Anything else? Constable Cooper

11:12.801 --> 11:14.661
had opium in his stomach.

11:14.661 --> 11:17.701
People usually smoke it,
but it appears he was eating it.

11:19.301 --> 11:22.661
Perhaps the killer used it to
sedate him, prior to the attack?

11:22.661 --> 11:25.261
Which seems to point back to
the herbalist again.

11:26.781 --> 11:30.501
So this Feng Choy
could be good for Cooper's murder.

11:30.501 --> 11:34.221
There are some connections. The
location, the opium, broken bottles.

11:34.221 --> 11:35.761
But?
HE CHUCKLES

11:35.761 --> 11:38.161
There always is one with you,
Murdoch.

11:38.161 --> 11:40.041
Feng Choy is an old man.

11:40.041 --> 11:42.961
Perhaps he sedated Cooper,
then put the boots to him.

11:42.961 --> 11:46.381
It's possible, but a very thin case.

11:46.381 --> 11:49.001
Sirs, Cooper's
murderer has been found.

11:51.221 --> 11:53.101
FENG CHOY PROTESTS IN CANTONESE

11:53.101 --> 11:55.941
Davis,
what the bloody hell are they doing?

11:55.941 --> 11:59.081
Arresting Cooper's murderer.
Based on what evidence?

11:59.081 --> 12:00.741
Broken glass, opium.

12:00.741 --> 12:04.361
You weren't trying to keep
it from us, were you, Murdoch?

12:04.361 --> 12:07.021
We also tossed the place,
found this.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.341
SHE GASPS

12:12.241 --> 12:13.741
It's Cooper's watch.

12:18.141 --> 12:21.321
Got something to say, slant?
I can't let you arrest this man.

12:21.321 --> 12:26.041
Murdoch, he has to be questioned.
Questioned, yes, not beaten.

12:26.041 --> 12:31.021
Chief Constable Stockton
put Station House Number Four in
charge of this investigation.

12:31.021 --> 12:34.521
If anyone is going to arrest
Feng Choy, it will be me.

12:37.861 --> 12:41.661
I want some answers, gentlemen.
This man we have in custody.

12:41.661 --> 12:43.061
Is he our killer, or is he not?

12:43.061 --> 12:44.741
Yes, sir, he is.

12:44.741 --> 12:47.981
I'm not so convinced. Cooper died
a brutal death to be sure.

12:47.981 --> 12:50.161
But the circumstances
remain unclear.

12:50.161 --> 12:53.801
The circumstances? Are you joking?

12:53.801 --> 12:56.441
Watch your tone, Inspector.

12:56.441 --> 12:58.221
Feng Choy had Cooper's watch.

12:58.221 --> 13:01.701
The watch was in Feng Choy's shop,
not on his person.

13:01.701 --> 13:05.221
And we have no motive, sir, and to
be honest, Feng Choy is a little old

13:05.221 --> 13:08.401
to be taking on a constable
in his prime, the size of Cooper.

13:08.401 --> 13:10.141
Sir, he's being naive.

13:10.141 --> 13:12.401
Cooper was sedated
by Feng Choy's opium.

13:12.401 --> 13:15.881
One of my officers overheard Murdoch
say so himself in the morgue.

13:15.881 --> 13:17.941
That was repeated out of context.

13:17.941 --> 13:20.561
Enough!

13:20.561 --> 13:22.361
I want an arrest,

13:22.361 --> 13:24.141
and that means a confession.

13:27.141 --> 13:31.561
And Murdoch,
I'm leaving this case in your hands.

13:31.561 --> 13:33.501
Don't lose control of it again.

13:33.501 --> 13:34.961
Yes, sir.

13:40.521 --> 13:44.821
As far as I'm concerned,
you have our killer in your cells.

13:44.821 --> 13:46.761
I know I'm right.

13:51.381 --> 13:53.741
We're all on the same side, Davis.

13:56.881 --> 13:58.341
Are we?

14:02.501 --> 14:05.461
Well, it's crystal clear,
Murdoch, isn't it?

14:05.461 --> 14:07.501
We have got to get Feng Choy to talk.

14:19.161 --> 14:21.401
Mr Choy,

14:21.401 --> 14:23.121
you have been charged with murder.

14:23.121 --> 14:27.061
If you don't speak to the
evidence against you, you will hang.

14:27.061 --> 14:29.161
LING TRANSLATES IN CANTONESE

14:36.941 --> 14:40.381
How did Constable Cooper's
watch end up in your shop?

14:47.801 --> 14:50.321
I'm sorry, Detective.

14:50.321 --> 14:53.241
The more he refuses to speak,
the worse it looks for him.

14:53.241 --> 14:55.181
He knows.

14:56.601 --> 14:58.921
Perhaps you can answer for him?

15:03.441 --> 15:06.901
Did Constable Cooper
purchase opium from your store?

15:06.901 --> 15:11.701
Yes, he had much pain in his back.

15:11.701 --> 15:13.421
He bought from us every week.

15:15.001 --> 15:17.021
And what about Mei-Li? Did she...?

15:17.021 --> 15:19.601
No Mei-Li!

15:19.601 --> 15:21.501
Why are you protecting her?

15:21.501 --> 15:23.981
Did she kill Constable Cooper?

15:30.361 --> 15:31.761
He says Mei-Li is innocent.

15:31.761 --> 15:33.321
Where is she?

15:35.601 --> 15:36.901
Why won't you tell me?

15:38.101 --> 15:39.981
KNOCKING ON DOOR

16:03.901 --> 16:05.861
PEOPLE CHATTER

16:09.801 --> 16:11.781
ROOM FALLS SILENT

16:18.361 --> 16:21.161
Gentlemen, have you got a
confession from our killer yet?

16:21.161 --> 16:23.301
No, sir.

16:23.301 --> 16:26.221
Nor do I believe we have Constable
Cooper's killer in custody.

16:27.821 --> 16:32.241
Then you've got some nerve
coming here, Murdoch.

16:32.241 --> 16:36.061
We're here to pay our respects
to a fallen brother. Brother?

16:36.061 --> 16:37.501
That's rich.

16:40.921 --> 16:43.461
Sir, it's time.

16:46.201 --> 16:47.501
I need a drink.

16:55.961 --> 16:58.101
Constable Curtis Cooper.

16:59.001 --> 17:00.841
Coop.

17:00.841 --> 17:03.241
Was a damn good copper

17:03.241 --> 17:05.501
and a damn good friend.

17:07.881 --> 17:11.701
When he dove back into that burning
shed last year to save a young girl,

17:11.701 --> 17:14.540
we saw his courage.

17:14.540 --> 17:19.241
When he took our shifts because we
needed time with our families, or...

17:19.241 --> 17:22.421
Or when Holder's drunk.
GENTLE LAUGHTER

17:22.421 --> 17:25.540
Yes, even then, we saw his loyalty.

17:27.141 --> 17:32.241
When he pushed us to win each year
at the Police Games, we saw his...

17:32.241 --> 17:36.201
commitment to the Constabulary.

17:36.201 --> 17:39.301
This year, the Games will be
dedicated to Constable Cooper.

17:40.881 --> 17:43.581
So raise a glass with me.

17:45.333 --> 17:46.973
To Cooper.
 ALL: To Cooper.

17:48.033 --> 17:49.813
To Coop. Cooper.
GLASSES CLINK

18:04.113 --> 18:05.993
Take no notice of this lot.

18:05.993 --> 18:10.753
You put the noose around
the real killer's neck
and it's all "Hail fellow well met."

18:13.933 --> 18:16.613
With the Constabulary, sir,

18:16.613 --> 18:19.113
I've always thought I'd
found a place where I fit in.

18:19.113 --> 18:20.853
Ah, buck up, Murdoch!

18:20.853 --> 18:23.253
You're a different kind of copper,

18:23.253 --> 18:26.933
and it's what this ungrateful lot
needs, whether they like it or not.

18:26.933 --> 18:29.713
Do you hear me?

18:29.713 --> 18:31.393
Thank you, sir. Right.

18:31.393 --> 18:33.093
Well, good.

18:45.133 --> 18:46.813
What have you, George?

18:47.913 --> 18:50.313
Sir, Edward Chen purports
to be an advocate

18:50.313 --> 18:52.133
of the Chinese community in Toronto,

18:52.133 --> 18:54.453
but he doesn't
even live in Chinatown.

18:54.453 --> 18:57.033
He has a huge house in Parkdale.

18:57.033 --> 18:58.273
Hmm...

18:58.273 --> 19:01.493
No doubt bought with money made
off the blood and sweat of others.

19:01.493 --> 19:05.393
Also, sir, word
around the neighbourhood
is that he runs a gambling room.

19:05.393 --> 19:06.893
You'll never guess where.

19:10.433 --> 19:12.173
PEOPLE CHATTER

19:35.213 --> 19:36.713
Wait, wait.

19:36.713 --> 19:38.253
Do not panic.

19:38.253 --> 19:40.213
I will resolve this.

19:40.213 --> 19:44.373
You're involved in illegal
gambling, Mr Chen, just how do
you intend to resolve this?

19:45.993 --> 19:48.613
I am sure we can come
to an arrangement.

19:48.613 --> 19:53.033
I knew when Cooper died
I would have to renegotiate.

19:53.033 --> 19:54.833
What are your terms?

19:54.833 --> 19:56.653
My terms?

19:56.653 --> 20:02.673
Cooper took 20%. I always thought
that was a bit excessive but then,
what choice do I have? You're lying.

20:02.673 --> 20:04.613
Cooper was a decorated officer.

20:04.613 --> 20:07.433
He also liked his bread with
butter, just like we all do.

20:07.433 --> 20:11.913
Is that why you fought,
because he was asking for too much?

20:11.913 --> 20:13.553
There was no fight.

20:13.553 --> 20:16.433
Cooper hit me because I did not pay.

20:16.433 --> 20:19.633
It was not my fault.
Feng Choy did not pay his share.

20:19.633 --> 20:22.833
And why didn't Feng Choy pay?

20:22.833 --> 20:24.613
I already tell you, Mei-Li.

20:26.173 --> 20:30.793
What about Mei-Li?
Feng Choy did not tell me.

20:32.453 --> 20:34.653
It wasn't just Chen, sir.

20:34.653 --> 20:36.533
I've made inquiries.

20:36.533 --> 20:38.593
Cooper had his
hands in many pockets.

20:38.593 --> 20:42.653
Come on, Murdoch, it's not unknown
for a policeman to
accept an offer here and there.

20:42.653 --> 20:46.933
Chicken, a nice bull's tongue,
a rhubarb pie
from a certain young lady?

20:46.933 --> 20:50.033
Sir, that pie was a thank you.
So you say.

20:50.033 --> 20:54.613
All right, maybe he was taking
bribes. What if he got greedy?

20:54.613 --> 20:58.733
Started to demand an even bigger
pay-off and got killed for it.

20:58.733 --> 21:01.693
I wonder if Inspector Davis
knew about this?

21:01.693 --> 21:04.213
And how does Mei-Li fit in?

21:09.353 --> 21:14.733
The glass found at the crime scene
matches the glass
found in Feng Choy's shop.

21:14.733 --> 21:18.133
But neither match the glass
found in Cooper's wound.

21:18.133 --> 21:20.433
Sir, I thought glass was glass.

21:20.433 --> 21:24.053
All glass has different compositions
and physical qualities.

21:24.053 --> 21:26.313
It can be matched
to different time periods,

21:26.313 --> 21:28.273
even the factory
in which it was made.

21:28.273 --> 21:31.613
So what of the glass found in
Cooper's wound? Take a look.

21:33.193 --> 21:36.173
The glass found in Cooper's wound
has physical qualities

21:36.173 --> 21:39.133
suggesting it was made
using the crown glass process.

21:39.133 --> 21:42.013
Ah, the crown glass process, I see.

21:43.753 --> 21:45.533
Actually, sir, I don't see.

21:47.113 --> 21:50.853
The physical qualities suggest that
we are looking for a window pane.

21:53.533 --> 21:56.053
William, I've made
an unusual discovery.

21:56.053 --> 21:58.973
What is it? I analysed the
blood found at the crime scene.

21:58.973 --> 22:00.653
It was the blood of an animal.

22:00.653 --> 22:04.293
It appears someone
doused the area with it after
Constable Cooper was dead.

22:04.293 --> 22:08.833
Why would anybody do that?
Because someone wanted to stage
the crime scene, George.

22:08.833 --> 22:11.333
Which means Cooper's body was moved.

22:13.997 --> 22:18.417
Sir, I don't understand,
we've already been over the evidence
from Cooper's crime scene.

22:18.417 --> 22:21.457
Staged crime scene, George,
an important distinction.

22:21.457 --> 22:24.157
The killer
moved the body for a reason.

22:24.157 --> 22:25.717
To frame this Feng Choy fellow?

22:25.717 --> 22:28.817
Quite possibly. We have to find
the real crime scene.

22:28.817 --> 22:32.717
Therefore, we have to examine all of
the evidence from a new perspective.

22:32.717 --> 22:37.917
Well, sir, at the risk of sounding
defeatist, I could look over
this watch six ways from Sunday,

22:37.917 --> 22:40.157
I still
won't find any new fingermarks.

22:40.157 --> 22:42.437
It's just too smudged.

22:46.077 --> 22:47.817
What's this, George?

22:50.617 --> 22:52.637
Some sort of white powder, sir.

22:55.657 --> 22:57.517
Oh, sir, is that sanitary?

22:57.517 --> 23:00.937
I mean... Plaster.
Yes, or some sort of...

23:00.937 --> 23:02.897
It's plaster.

23:02.897 --> 23:04.877
Oh, well where would
that have come from?

23:10.697 --> 23:16.297
Well, I'll be damned. Plaster dust,
sir, no doubt the same as the
dust we found on Cooper's clothing.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.597
Sir, window panes.

23:19.597 --> 23:22.037
Broken shards.

23:22.037 --> 23:25.197
Most likely the same as the
glass we found in Cooper's wound.

23:27.117 --> 23:28.677
Blood, a great deal of it.

23:30.517 --> 23:34.357
Arterial spray. George,
take some samples of this blood.

23:34.357 --> 23:36.657
Sir.

23:36.657 --> 23:39.077
Clearly someone
tried to cover this up, sir.

23:44.117 --> 23:46.537
What have you got there,
Murdoch, a bit of string?

23:46.537 --> 23:48.757
It's thicker.

23:48.757 --> 23:51.957
I wonder if the fibres match
those we found in Cooper's wound.

23:53.557 --> 23:55.797
George,
gather up all of this new evidence

23:55.797 --> 23:59.277
and take it over to Dr Ogden
for analysis as soon as possible.

24:01.237 --> 24:04.537
Sir, I believe we've
found our murder scene.

24:04.537 --> 24:08.137
Bloody hell,
right behind a copper's pub.

24:18.077 --> 24:22.057
There ought to be a sign outside
this copper bar - "Members Only."

24:22.057 --> 24:23.517
What did you say?

24:25.877 --> 24:28.777
I said there should be a sign out
front that says "Members Only."

24:28.777 --> 24:33.397
Well, it might interest you geniuses
to know that Cooper wasn't
killed outside Feng Choy's shop,

24:33.397 --> 24:35.157
but in the alley
behind this very pub.

24:35.157 --> 24:36.817
Hold on, Brackenreid.

24:36.817 --> 24:39.797
Don't you think we'd have noticed
a thing like that?

24:39.797 --> 24:42.917
The evidence is quite conclusive.
You've got the sworn statements.

24:42.917 --> 24:45.517
None of the men
saw Coop here that night.

24:45.517 --> 24:47.437
And there's the rub.

24:47.437 --> 24:49.877
We need to ask a few questions.

24:49.877 --> 24:53.357
You mean to question
us in the death of one of our own?

24:53.357 --> 24:57.077
Settle down, Townsend.
No-one's suggesting there was
a badge on the killer.

24:57.077 --> 25:00.117
Isn't that right, Detective?
I'd like to hear that from him.

25:00.117 --> 25:04.557
Perhaps you can tell us how a man
was killed right outside this pub

25:04.557 --> 25:06.397
and no-one noticed.

25:09.257 --> 25:12.117
I think it's time both of you left.

25:12.117 --> 25:15.177
You'll not be interrogating my men,
and that's final.

25:16.717 --> 25:18.397
Very well, Inspector,

25:18.397 --> 25:19.997
but the truth will come out.

25:19.997 --> 25:22.057
One way or another.

25:31.837 --> 25:34.257
Are you sure that was wise, Murdoch?

25:34.257 --> 25:38.457
You might have warned me
you were going to accuse one
cop of murdering another.

25:38.457 --> 25:41.117
Sir, they jumped to their
own conclusions. That may be,

25:41.117 --> 25:44.557
but we still need conclusive evidence
and we need it now. Is that clear?

25:44.557 --> 25:46.037
Yes, sir.

25:50.237 --> 25:53.717
The dried blood found behind
Bruiser's is definitely human.

25:53.717 --> 25:56.037
Confirming he was killed there.

25:56.037 --> 25:58.037
Good.

25:58.037 --> 25:59.797
Are you all right, William?

25:59.797 --> 26:03.557
This must be hard on you, to be
tearing down the thing you love.

26:03.557 --> 26:06.037
I prefer to think I'm protecting it.

26:06.037 --> 26:07.757
Despite the consequences?

26:07.757 --> 26:10.077
Julia, I can do no less.

26:10.077 --> 26:11.977
I know, William.

26:14.237 --> 26:15.977
That's what I admire about you.

26:19.877 --> 26:23.237
But you will be careful, won't you?
Of course.

26:23.237 --> 26:28.617
Have you found anything else?
Yes, that piece of string
that you found, it may help us.

26:28.617 --> 26:32.197
It's a perfect match to the dark
fibres I found in Cooper's wound.

26:32.197 --> 26:34.377
How they got there, I've no idea.

26:39.222 --> 26:44.322
Perhaps the killer tried to stop
the bleeding by using a
bootlace as a tourniquet. Ah, yes.

26:44.322 --> 26:49.042
That would account for the bruising
around the upper thigh. Which
confirms one very important thing.

26:49.042 --> 26:50.682
Cooper knew his killer.

26:50.682 --> 26:54.502
You'll agree the attempt to apply
a tourniquet indicates remorse.

26:54.502 --> 26:56.662
And a policeman is
trained in first aid.

26:56.662 --> 27:00.282
I think we can safely assume
that the attacker
didn't intend to kill Cooper.

27:00.282 --> 27:04.262
That might spare a copper
from the noose, but how do you
figure it was an accident?

27:06.422 --> 27:11.322
I believe the night he died,
Cooper confronted his assailant,
out of sight of the other men.

27:11.322 --> 27:14.582
That explains why
the lads never saw Cooper.

27:17.562 --> 27:19.662
Get to the part
where it's accidental.

27:19.662 --> 27:21.662
The argument moved into the alley.

27:23.222 --> 27:26.882
Once outside, the argument
escalated and punches were thrown.

27:26.882 --> 27:30.682
One knocked Cooper to the ground.
And into the window pane.

27:30.682 --> 27:34.002
COOPER CRIES OUT

27:34.002 --> 27:35.902
The man then tried to save his life.

27:35.902 --> 27:41.282
Failing to do so, he moved the body
and staged an alternate crime scene.

27:41.282 --> 27:44.882
Something else that a copper
would know to do. Yes.

27:48.002 --> 27:50.102
It would be helpful
to have a suspect.

27:50.102 --> 27:55.522
Unfortunately, this assailant
knows all our tricks,
being a policeman as well.

27:55.522 --> 27:59.642
What were they arguing about that was
so bloody important? I can't imagine.

27:59.642 --> 28:02.342
But this Feng Choy knows something.

28:02.342 --> 28:05.062
And this Mei-Li figures into it too.
But exactly how?

28:05.062 --> 28:08.482
Excuse me. Detective,
there's a package here for you.

28:08.482 --> 28:10.942
I'm not expecting
any deliveries, George.

28:10.942 --> 28:14.382
You might want to come
take a look at this one, sir,
it's quite something.

28:17.522 --> 28:19.122
What's this, Murdoch?

28:19.122 --> 28:21.142
I have no idea.

28:22.862 --> 28:26.342
No return address.
Well, open it then.

28:38.662 --> 28:40.702
I believe it's
a message for me, sir.

28:40.702 --> 28:44.162
An intimidation tactic
from Station Five no doubt.

28:44.162 --> 28:47.662
Well, that's it, then. We can't
let them get away with this, can we?

28:47.662 --> 28:50.542
Hmm? Boys?

28:50.542 --> 28:51.922
Anyone? Higgins?

28:51.922 --> 28:54.522
It's not been easy, sirs.

28:54.522 --> 28:58.142
There's been glares on the beat
and snide remarks in the bars.

28:58.142 --> 29:01.382
We're all of us targets, sir.
Because of me?

29:02.903 --> 29:06.123
Sir, I'm sorry,
but a policeman has been killed.

29:06.123 --> 29:10.143
Detective Murdoch is having
to fight on every side to make
sure the killer is caught.

29:10.143 --> 29:12.903
And now Station Five think
that we can be intimidated?

29:12.903 --> 29:15.203
Are we going to let them?

29:15.203 --> 29:16.843
Or will we show them what's for?

29:16.843 --> 29:20.083
Show them what's for!
Show them what's what, boys!

29:20.083 --> 29:23.983
Not just yet, lads. Tomorrow, it's us
against Station Five in the finals.

29:23.983 --> 29:26.663
As of now, we have a new strategy!
To obliterate the bastards!

29:29.224 --> 29:30.824
Here, here, sir.

29:30.824 --> 29:32.664
Ah!

29:48.744 --> 29:50.584
Now it's down to the finals.

29:50.584 --> 29:54.024
Station Four verses Station Five.

29:54.024 --> 29:59.044
Keep cordially
and graciously, gentleman,
make the Constabulary proud.

30:00.184 --> 30:03.104
Come on, Inspector! You've got him!

30:08.381 --> 30:12.561
Murdoch thinks you're hiding
something and I'm inclined to agree.

30:12.561 --> 30:18.081
You're wrong, or didn't
Murdoch get the message?
Oh, he got it, all right. We all did.

30:18.081 --> 30:20.401
Care to hear our collective reply?

30:20.401 --> 30:22.541
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

30:23.821 --> 30:25.521
Back it up, boys.

30:25.521 --> 30:27.241
Man the rope!

30:29.121 --> 30:31.021
Take the strain!

30:31.021 --> 30:32.941
Ready, boys?

30:32.941 --> 30:34.641
Steady...

30:34.641 --> 30:36.721
Pull!

30:42.761 --> 30:46.381
Come on, Five.
We're playing for Cooper.
We're all playing for Cooper.

30:46.381 --> 30:50.201
We don't lose to rats
who protect killers.
We don't lose to corrupt cops.

30:50.201 --> 30:53.621
What's that, Murdoch?
You want at us?

30:53.621 --> 30:56.821
Maybe we all do. Is that right?
Crabtree, I'll have...

30:56.821 --> 30:59.581
Easy, Inspector.
Let's not lose our heads now, OK?

30:59.581 --> 31:02.321
Sunshine, don't be a hero.

31:02.321 --> 31:05.001
Townsend, forget rank. Yeah? Yes!

31:05.001 --> 31:07.641
WHISTLE BLOWS

31:12.921 --> 31:15.841
Your behaviour was
juvenile and offensive.

31:15.841 --> 31:19.241
And at a time when more than ever...

31:19.241 --> 31:23.721
the public needs to trust
that the Constabulary
is disciplined and restrained.

31:23.721 --> 31:25.201
Now, what the hell happened?

31:27.181 --> 31:31.701
Detective Murdoch's been sniffing
around Station Five
thinking Cooper's killer's among us.

31:31.701 --> 31:35.361
Is this true, Murdoch? I must
consider all possibilities, sir.

31:35.361 --> 31:40.241
And what sort of
solid evidence do you have?

31:40.241 --> 31:42.321
Admittedly nothing conclusive, yet.

31:42.321 --> 31:48.161
Well then, it is simple isn't it,
Murdoch? I want this
Feng Choy charged, case closed.

31:48.161 --> 31:49.761
But sir!

31:49.761 --> 31:52.801
And I want to see an end to the
animosity between station houses.

31:52.801 --> 31:58.141
You will collect yourselves,
gentleman and be ready
to man that rope in one hour.

31:58.141 --> 32:02.001
The next time,
it better be sportsmanlike.

32:03.681 --> 32:08.001
Or I see a great many
new recruits in our future.

32:10.041 --> 32:14.081
It's done. With all due respect,
sir, it's not nearly done.

32:14.081 --> 32:16.181
All right, listen up...

32:16.181 --> 32:19.161
It's clear that Station Five
are hiding something.

32:19.161 --> 32:21.661
And that this Feng Choy
holds the key.

32:21.661 --> 32:24.941
You've got one hour
to make your case, Murdoch.

32:24.941 --> 32:26.401
Yes, sir.

32:39.601 --> 32:41.761
You have news of my Uncle?

32:41.761 --> 32:45.321
My superiors
believe him to be guilty.

32:45.321 --> 32:49.961
He's to be officially
charged with the murder and
most likely will hang.

32:49.961 --> 32:51.241
But he is innocent!

32:51.241 --> 32:52.841
I agree with you.

32:55.241 --> 32:56.881
You do?

32:56.881 --> 32:59.501
But you must understand,

32:59.501 --> 33:04.981
unless I find out how Mei-Li is
involved in this or where she is,

33:04.981 --> 33:07.761
I can't help your uncle.
I cannot force him to talk.

33:09.441 --> 33:13.581
He is her grandfather, he sees
it as his duty to protect her.

33:13.581 --> 33:15.721
Who will protect her
when he is hanged?

33:21.511 --> 33:25.591
The police take money and
sometimes herbs from the shop.

33:25.591 --> 33:27.331
But one went too far.

33:29.551 --> 33:31.011
With Mei-Li?

33:33.991 --> 33:35.971
HE SPEAKS IN CANTONESE

33:38.831 --> 33:41.251
He forced himself upon her.

33:41.251 --> 33:43.211
She is a child.

33:44.291 --> 33:46.071
Was it Cooper?

33:46.071 --> 33:47.831
Constable Cooper?

33:56.291 --> 33:59.211
No. Another one.
He does not know his name.

33:59.211 --> 34:01.511
Only that Mei-Li
called him the "Mean One".

34:02.831 --> 34:04.991
Did Cooper find out about this?

34:15.471 --> 34:17.831
Before he died, he came to the shop.

34:17.831 --> 34:19.511
Because I did not pay him.

34:19.511 --> 34:22.630
I was very angry and I told
him what had happened to Mei-Li.

34:22.630 --> 34:24.670
Then what?

34:30.690 --> 34:32.451
He became very quiet.

34:37.911 --> 34:40.351
Mr Choy...

34:41.630 --> 34:46.851
I'm very sorry
that your granddaughter had to
endure such suffering.

35:01.431 --> 35:03.871
HE SOBS

35:06.251 --> 35:11.511
Mei-Li must come forward, it's the
only way I can save your uncle
and put the proper man in prison.

35:11.511 --> 35:13.831
I will speak to him.

35:24.111 --> 35:25.131
Rape?

35:25.131 --> 35:28.011
This man's not just a killer,
Murdoch. He's a monster.

35:28.011 --> 35:32.351
Perhaps Cooper felt
the same way, sir. Right, I see.

35:39.769 --> 35:45.249
I think I may know, sir.
Mei-Li apparently referred
to him as the "Mean One".

35:45.249 --> 35:47.069
You got something to say, slant?

35:47.069 --> 35:48.529
Pete Holder?

35:48.529 --> 35:51.469
He certainly fits the description.

35:51.469 --> 35:55.129
It was Holder who sent
Cooper into the glass.

36:00.809 --> 36:03.569
He tried to save Cooper's life.
But to no avail.

36:03.569 --> 36:08.009
I suppose it does make some kind of
god-awful sense, Murdoch.

36:08.009 --> 36:10.189
Excuse me, sir,
it's been about an hour.

36:10.189 --> 36:12.069
We should get back
to the tug-of-war.

36:12.069 --> 36:17.629
Bloody timing. Come on, we'd better
get back to it, otherwise Stockton
will have our guts for garters. Sir?

36:17.629 --> 36:18.969
He'll be annoyed.

36:25.169 --> 36:27.489
You ready?

36:27.489 --> 36:30.049
Good luck, Detective.

36:30.049 --> 36:32.029
They still call you that?

36:32.029 --> 36:35.389
Hey, hey. Easy now. Come on.

36:37.569 --> 36:40.849
Don't mind him.

36:40.849 --> 36:42.969
Listen, things got
out of hand back there.

36:42.969 --> 36:46.989
What do you say we put all
this animosity behind us, hey?

36:46.989 --> 36:49.689
I've shown no one animosity.

36:49.689 --> 36:51.729
OK.

36:51.729 --> 36:53.309
Know this...

36:53.309 --> 36:58.149
If your pursue this,
there will be consequences.

36:58.149 --> 37:01.149
Yes. There will be.

37:01.149 --> 37:04.089
All right, men.
Gather round. Come on.

37:04.089 --> 37:08.029
I want a clean competition.

37:08.029 --> 37:12.389
No one will get a third chance.
Understood?

37:14.469 --> 37:17.809
This event will determine the
winner of this year's Police Games.

37:17.809 --> 37:19.049
Good luck.

37:21.489 --> 37:23.389
This is it.

37:25.809 --> 37:27.589
Man the rope!

37:30.409 --> 37:33.809
Take the strain. Steady!

37:33.809 --> 37:35.209
Pull!

38:08.209 --> 38:09.849
Pull!

38:09.849 --> 38:13.029
WHISTLE BLOWS

38:14.629 --> 38:17.509
What the bloody hell happened?
We had them!

38:17.509 --> 38:22.769
Sir, I believe we still do. George,
I need you to do something for me.

38:22.769 --> 38:23.889
Sir.

38:23.889 --> 38:26.369
Here's to Precinct Five.

38:28.249 --> 38:32.209
He's got four of them!

38:32.209 --> 38:36.029
All right, you blue devils,
shut your yaps.

38:36.029 --> 38:38.209
Normally I'd toast you fine lads

38:38.209 --> 38:40.129
but tonight...

38:40.129 --> 38:42.849
I turn the floor over to Townsend.

38:42.849 --> 38:46.889
You gave us a scare with your
slip up but you fought back

38:46.889 --> 38:50.589
and you brought us home, lad.
Now give us a few words.

38:54.589 --> 38:56.349
Thank you, sir.

38:58.909 --> 39:03.729
Well, boys, looks like
we've got another year to brag
about what we know anyway.

39:03.729 --> 39:08.689
We may be a bunch of louts
but we're the best damn louts
this city has to offer!

39:08.689 --> 39:10.609
THEY CHEER

39:11.709 --> 39:15.229
Now, we wouldn't be the coppers we
are today if it weren't for Cooper.

39:15.229 --> 39:18.329
Let's just remember him as he was.

39:18.329 --> 39:22.849
Dead in an alley, you mean?

39:22.849 --> 39:24.849
What the hell is this, Murdoch?

39:24.849 --> 39:26.949
He's here on business.

39:26.949 --> 39:30.849
What type of business?
An arrest, Mr Townsend.

39:30.849 --> 39:33.849
The night that Cooper died,

39:33.849 --> 39:36.209
Mr Townsend was here, in the bar.

39:36.209 --> 39:40.029
CHUCKLES: I'm here every night,
aren't I?

39:40.029 --> 39:43.249
Cooper wanted
to talk and you knew what about.

39:43.249 --> 39:49.889
So you moved it to the alley
before anyone saw you,
where the two of you fought.

39:49.889 --> 39:55.009
Constable Cooper fell on panes of
broken glass and slashed his leg.

39:55.009 --> 39:56.489
HE SCOFFS

39:56.489 --> 40:00.729
That's crazy.
Coop was my friend, my beat partner.

40:00.729 --> 40:05.349
You tried to stop the bleeding
using one of your
shoelaces as a tourniquet.

40:05.349 --> 40:07.589
That's why your laces don't match.

40:07.589 --> 40:10.149
And when that didn't work,
you panicked.

40:10.149 --> 40:14.509
You moved his body and planted
his watch at Feng Choy's.

40:14.509 --> 40:17.529
What are you on about, Murdoch?
Where's your motive?

40:17.529 --> 40:19.769
She's right here, sir.

40:21.989 --> 40:27.949
Miss Ling, please ask Mei-Li
if the constable that
assaulted her is in this room.

40:27.949 --> 40:29.569
LING SPEAKS IN CANTONESE

40:37.849 --> 40:40.709
You raped this young girl.

40:40.709 --> 40:45.569
And when Cooper found out about it,
he confronted you.
And for that, he died.

40:45.569 --> 40:49.969
Constable Townsend, look at me.

40:51.249 --> 40:52.729
Is this true?

40:57.089 --> 40:59.869
I mean, come on, lads. Look at her.

41:02.189 --> 41:05.629
It's not as though you haven't
thought about it. Right? I...

41:05.629 --> 41:07.449
I slipped.

41:07.449 --> 41:10.009
That's it.

41:10.009 --> 41:12.389
And Coop...

41:12.389 --> 41:18.049
Coop just over-reacted.
I tried to talk him down but he...

41:18.049 --> 41:20.289
Things got out of hand.

41:24.169 --> 41:29.129
You understand, don't you?
It was an accident.

41:29.129 --> 41:32.189
I... I tried to save him. I did.

41:33.289 --> 41:35.729
There was so much blood, I...
I didn't know what to do!

41:35.729 --> 41:38.729
You killed a cop, Townsend.

41:38.729 --> 41:41.789
And you were going to let an
old man hang for your crime.

41:46.629 --> 41:49.569
Someone take this disgrace away.
Lads.

41:57.009 --> 41:59.449
We'll leave you to your...

41:59.449 --> 42:01.629
celebration.

42:25.209 --> 42:27.449
HE SPEAKS IN CANTONESE

42:30.129 --> 42:32.889
My uncle would like to say something
to you.

42:38.129 --> 42:40.769
I'm sorry I doubted you.

42:44.989 --> 42:50.209
I thought you were all the same
but there is goodness in you.

42:52.009 --> 42:55.169
And where there is good in one part,
there is good in the whole.

42:57.089 --> 42:59.409
Lao Tzu? Confucius...?

42:59.409 --> 43:00.989
LING CHUCKLES

43:00.989 --> 43:02.449
Feng Choy, I believe.

43:06.889 --> 43:08.569
Thank you.

43:14.569 --> 43:18.309
THEY CHEER AND WHOOP

43:18.309 --> 43:21.129
"There's good in one,
there's good in the whole."

43:21.129 --> 43:22.749
They are pithy, those Chinese.

43:23.549 --> 43:25.709
Chief Constable Stockton!

43:25.709 --> 43:29.989
Davis at Station Five asked me
to give this to you boys.

43:29.989 --> 43:32.669
He says you deserve it,
and he's right.

43:32.669 --> 43:37.649
Thank you, sir. I've also come
to congratulate you too, Murdoch.

43:37.649 --> 43:41.169
And to offer you a proposition.

43:41.169 --> 43:44.509
How do you feel about Winnipeg?

43:44.509 --> 43:45.809
Winnipeg, sir?

43:45.809 --> 43:51.229
Well... You solved
Constable Cooper's murder.

43:51.229 --> 43:53.789
But you did it by investigating
your fellow officers.

43:56.269 --> 44:00.569
Hard to do one without the other.
Quite. Quite.

44:00.569 --> 44:01.889
But as for Winnipeg...

44:04.429 --> 44:06.649
I think things would be
easier for you out there.

44:09.929 --> 44:12.509
I don't believe they would be, sir.

44:12.509 --> 44:14.289
This is my home.

44:15.949 --> 44:19.129
There you have it, Chief Constable.
Fine.

44:20.249 --> 44:23.229
Good. Good.

44:23.229 --> 44:26.649
Well, the Constabulary
thanks you, Murdoch.

44:26.649 --> 44:28.729
So do the people of Toronto.

44:31.409 --> 44:32.669
BRACKENREID SIGHS

44:32.669 --> 44:36.389
Don't worry about it, Murdoch.

44:36.389 --> 44:38.449
This will all pass.

44:38.449 --> 44:40.569
Sunny days ahead.

44:42.129 --> 44:43.809
Sunny days, sir.

44:43.809 --> 44:47.969
You did what you had to do, me old
mucker. Nothing more, nothing less.

44:49.689 --> 44:51.449
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
