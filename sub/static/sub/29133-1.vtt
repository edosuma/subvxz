02:22.576 --> 02:24.910
Hey! Hey!

02:26.714 --> 02:28.413
I didn't even
hear you pull in.

02:28.415 --> 02:29.648
The city approved the plans.

02:29.650 --> 02:32.184
-Take a look.
-Sure.

02:32.186 --> 02:34.653
-[whistles]
-So how long for the demo?

02:34.655 --> 02:37.156
A couple of days tops.

02:37.158 --> 02:41.560
Look at it. As soon as
it sees the bulldozer,
it's going to fall over.

02:41.562 --> 02:43.328
You know, you are you doing
them a favor.

02:44.265 --> 02:47.466
Next storm that passes through,
that'd do the job for you.

03:07.555 --> 03:08.620
What the--?

03:09.790 --> 03:11.190
Hey, do you see anything?

03:12.226 --> 03:13.292
Yeah, back up.

03:21.669 --> 03:22.734
Thanks.

03:28.609 --> 03:30.542
[suspense music]

04:04.845 --> 04:05.911
What the hell?

04:10.017 --> 04:11.416
Jesus Christ!

04:15.723 --> 04:16.922
Are you trying to kill me?

04:18.959 --> 04:20.858
What the hell
are you doing back there?

04:21.728 --> 04:24.630
Kid, out of the car! Now!

04:25.633 --> 04:27.799
What-- what's wrong with you?
Are you deaf?

04:29.370 --> 04:33.438
Kid, come on. Get out of my car.

04:33.440 --> 04:36.541
Get out of my-- hey,
we can do this the hard way.

04:38.012 --> 04:39.278
Come here.

04:39.947 --> 04:42.047
-[cries]
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:42.049 --> 04:46.451
calm down, buddy, calm down.
You're okay. You're okay, right?

04:46.453 --> 04:47.519
Stop.

04:51.358 --> 04:52.891
So, where did you come from?

04:55.496 --> 04:58.830
Do you belong
to someone around here?

05:03.971 --> 05:05.671
[suspense music]

05:30.964 --> 05:34.099
Excuse me, is this your--?
Okay.

05:36.970 --> 05:39.738
-Thanks so much.
I'll see you next week.
-Sure thing.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.473
Hi, can I help you?

05:41.475 --> 05:42.941
I think I found
something of yours.

05:42.943 --> 05:44.343
This little guy
belong to you?

05:44.345 --> 05:46.044
Yeah, that's my son.

05:46.046 --> 05:48.413
-Is everything okay?
-Well, not really.

05:48.415 --> 05:50.449
I was out in your lot
parked for about two minutes

05:50.451 --> 05:52.584
and he tried to stow away
in the backseat of my car.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.720
I was halfway out on the street
before I noticed he was there.

05:55.556 --> 05:59.891
Hugo, are you okay?
Baby, did you go outside?

05:59.893 --> 06:03.028
You're supposed to stay right
here when mommy's with a client.
You know that.

06:03.030 --> 06:06.465
I brought him back right away,
but you might want to try
keeping a better eye on him.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.500
I mean you might not be
so lucky next time.

06:08.502 --> 06:10.102
Excuse me? Next time?

06:10.104 --> 06:12.504
No, no, no. I'm just
saying I'm a nice guy.

06:12.506 --> 06:14.906
At least I'm not one of those
psychos you read about.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.875
-Do you have kids?
-No.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.778
Yeah, I didn't think so.
Look, I don't know who you are,

06:19.780 --> 06:22.514
-but I don't appreciate
you coming into my store--
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:22.516 --> 06:25.050
Your kid tried to run away.
I brought him back.

06:25.052 --> 06:28.854
He's fine. Nothing happened.
You alright? Right?

06:28.856 --> 06:30.689
See? We're all fine.

06:33.827 --> 06:36.895
I didn't mean to cause you
any trouble. I just want to make
sure you knew he was okay.

06:36.897 --> 06:40.866
I'm sorry. He's never done
anything like this before

06:40.868 --> 06:42.434
and he's not like--

06:44.538 --> 06:48.006
-thank you
for bringing him back.
-No problem.

06:48.008 --> 06:50.709
I was a bit adventurous
when I was a kid myself.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.511
Just like you. buddy.

06:52.513 --> 06:55.180
He's got a thing for cars
and trucks and all that.

06:55.182 --> 06:56.548
I can see that.

06:58.986 --> 07:01.787
Oh, you're a pretty talented
artist for such a little guy,

07:02.890 --> 07:03.955
you know?

07:07.628 --> 07:10.862
-Actually, I was meaning
to come in here.
-You'd like a reading?

07:10.864 --> 07:16.568
A what? Oh, you're the--
I see.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.136
No, actually,
I needed to talk to you.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.606
This is your store?

07:21.608 --> 07:23.642
I share the space
with another healer.

07:25.546 --> 07:27.779
Oh, but you're on the lease?

07:27.781 --> 07:30.949
No, his name is on it
and my mom's.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.617
They've been renting
here for years.

07:32.619 --> 07:35.921
-Are they around?
-No. He'll be back soon.

07:35.923 --> 07:38.857
And my mom, uh, is retired.

07:38.859 --> 07:42.127
Oh, okay. Well, see,
the reason I'm here
is I represent the new owner.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.162
We're redeveloping
this whole block.

07:48.669 --> 07:49.734
Tearing it down.

07:49.736 --> 07:55.674
I mean... I'm sure
you already knew that since--

07:55.676 --> 07:58.844
I'm sorry. Maybe I should just
talk to him when he's around.

07:58.846 --> 08:00.579
I'll come back.

08:00.581 --> 08:02.981
You can wait, if you want.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.650
He should be back soon.

08:06.787 --> 08:07.853
Okay.

08:09.857 --> 08:14.226
Let me give you a reading,
on the house, as a way to say,

08:14.228 --> 08:17.829
you know, thank you
for not kidnapping my son.

08:19.032 --> 08:23.235
A reading?
Um, sure, why not?

08:30.677 --> 08:33.544
Hugo, baby,
you stay right here, okay?

08:33.547 --> 08:35.714
Do not move.
You understand me?

08:39.586 --> 08:40.652
Follow me.

08:54.167 --> 08:55.567
Tell me your name.

08:55.569 --> 08:56.668
Daniel.

08:57.838 --> 09:00.171
-Hello, Daniel.
-What's your name?

09:00.173 --> 09:03.975
-I'm Nina.
-Pleasure to meet you, Nina.

09:03.977 --> 09:06.578
Place your hands
on mine, palms up.

09:42.883 --> 09:48.353
You have a strong will,
but... you're impulsive.

09:51.224 --> 09:57.896
Alone. No family.
And your work... you enjoy it.

09:57.898 --> 09:59.097
The competition.

10:00.867 --> 10:02.834
You like to win.

10:03.804 --> 10:04.869
Who doesn't?

10:06.006 --> 10:08.373
Well, ambition can be dangerous,

10:11.144 --> 10:13.278
but I see great success for you

10:14.982 --> 10:16.314
and soon...

10:16.316 --> 10:18.083
This deal that I have--

10:18.085 --> 10:20.719
No. More than that.

10:23.023 --> 10:25.924
-Wealth.
-I guess that's a good thing.

10:25.926 --> 10:28.827
If it's what you desire.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.228
Close your eyes.

10:42.309 --> 10:45.343
-You have a spirit
following you.
-Following me?

10:45.345 --> 10:47.312
I thought so,
when I first saw you.

10:48.715 --> 10:49.881
Oh, Daniel.

10:51.184 --> 10:53.184
You've suffered a great loss.

10:54.755 --> 10:58.356
She-- you keep her very close.

10:59.926 --> 11:02.827
-Maggie.
-Your wife?

11:04.264 --> 11:07.365
Uh-- Yeah.

11:09.136 --> 11:11.236
She's never very far from you.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.405
Can--

11:16.677 --> 11:18.143
Can you talk to my wife?

11:18.145 --> 11:20.278
I can only feel
her presence now.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.847
-I can't engage her.
-Please.

11:22.849 --> 11:25.884
It takes time to develop
a rapport with the spirit.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.752
How long?

11:27.754 --> 11:30.288
That depends.
We'd have to build trust.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.426
[door opens]

11:36.196 --> 11:40.198
That's Jro.
He's the one that you wanted
to see about the lease.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.001
Come back.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.271
We'll do another session.

12:13.900 --> 12:17.135
-Excuse me. Are you Jro?
-Honey. I'll be
whoever you want.

12:17.137 --> 12:18.470
What can I do for you?

12:34.821 --> 12:37.756
Why don't I ever get clients
that look like that?

12:37.758 --> 12:41.025
Oh, come on. You know
he's handsome. Is he single?

12:41.027 --> 12:43.361
Jro, aren't you upset
about the store?

12:43.363 --> 12:45.797
Well, I could tell something
like this was going to happen.

12:45.799 --> 12:48.099
It's in the air. And besides,

12:48.101 --> 12:50.802
I haven't had
a new client in months.

12:51.805 --> 12:53.204
This place is finished.

12:53.206 --> 12:57.242
No, we don't need some sexy
Angel of Death to tell us that.

12:57.244 --> 12:59.844
The universe
wants us to move on.

12:59.846 --> 13:03.348
Oh, and look.
He's making escape plans.

13:04.918 --> 13:07.352
Hugo wandered out earlier
when I was with the client,

13:07.354 --> 13:09.053
the first one I had all day.

13:09.055 --> 13:11.389
That guy Daniel saved him.

13:11.391 --> 13:13.525
-Saved him?
-Brought him back.

13:15.362 --> 13:20.198
Oh, he has a heart and a big fat
throbbing wallet

13:20.200 --> 13:22.967
in those jeans
that cost more than our rent.

13:22.969 --> 13:28.306
-Did you see anything good?
-His wife died
and I felt something there.

13:28.308 --> 13:32.410
Honey, you feel that dead wife
all the way to the bank,
you hear me?

13:32.412 --> 13:36.948
What? Clients like that don't
come around very often

13:36.950 --> 13:39.250
and men like that
don't come around ever.

13:39.252 --> 13:43.855
He needs your help,
and you need his.

13:43.857 --> 13:47.425
Mona, there you are.
I knew you'd be in today.

13:47.427 --> 13:50.295
I felt your energy the moment
I woke up this morning.

13:50.297 --> 13:51.863
You're radiating very strongly.

13:51.865 --> 13:53.898
Mm-Hm, come in. Come in.

13:53.900 --> 13:55.900
Have you saved up enough
for those crystals we need?

14:00.073 --> 14:03.541
-[Daniel] Yeah.
-Hey, my man. How'd it go?

14:05.846 --> 14:08.179
Fine.
No baseball bats this time.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.582
You were gone so long.

14:10.584 --> 14:14.052
Hey, listen.
I need you to send the eviction
notices by certified mail

14:14.054 --> 14:16.087
so they can't complain
that they didn't get them.

14:16.089 --> 14:18.189
Right. I was going
to put stamps on them.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.425
Oh, no. I need you to actually
go to the post office

14:20.427 --> 14:22.927
and get them certified
at the counter.

14:22.929 --> 14:27.198
Okay. Uh, hey, uh.

14:28.101 --> 14:30.635
When do I get
an intern or something?

14:32.505 --> 14:37.408
-You don't. No intern.
-I really feel like I'm ready
for more responsibility.

14:37.410 --> 14:41.312
-Yeah, like what?
-I want to do what you do.

14:41.314 --> 14:44.048
-Teach me.
-Look, Andrew,

14:44.050 --> 14:47.285
it's-- [clears his throat]
it's your first week, man.

14:47.287 --> 14:50.188
-Why don't you just--
-Slow my sweet buttery roll.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.558
Hold my horses.
Hold my stallions.

14:53.560 --> 14:56.394
-Yes, you do that.
-Just calm it down.

14:56.396 --> 14:59.964
Right, take a chill pill,
rectally.

15:01.034 --> 15:02.901
You can go.

15:02.903 --> 15:04.335
Yeah, I'm sorry.

15:06.039 --> 15:07.572
I knew there was a reason
I came in here.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.374
There was a reason
I came in to talk to you.

15:09.376 --> 15:12.377
My dad was-- I mean,
sorry Peter-- not my dad,

15:12.379 --> 15:15.446
Peter was asking if you could
come in and update him
when you get a chance.

15:15.448 --> 15:16.948
Okay, tell him
I'll be right there.

15:17.617 --> 15:20.652
Up top. No?

15:20.654 --> 15:21.920
Shut the door.

15:23.690 --> 15:24.989
Bye.

15:34.935 --> 15:37.268
-Peter, you wanted to see me?
-There he is.

15:38.371 --> 15:43.408
-What are we celebrating?
-I just wanted to toast
my new senior VP in style.

15:43.410 --> 15:44.642
Senior VP?

15:44.644 --> 15:48.146
You've cleared those zoning
hurdles in record time.

15:48.148 --> 15:50.548
And the way you hustled those
tenants out of there.

15:50.550 --> 15:53.251
Did you tell them
about all the asbestos?

15:54.721 --> 15:57.956
-What are you drinking? Rye?
-That's great.

15:59.659 --> 16:03.227
Listen, you're pulling
in better numbers than ever.

16:03.229 --> 16:06.731
The Tenth Street redevelopment
is going to be big money

16:06.733 --> 16:10.735
for this firm...
and I want you to run point.

16:12.339 --> 16:15.640
-Um, Peter.
-I don't want
any excuses, Daniel.

16:15.642 --> 16:16.708
I need you.

16:18.745 --> 16:20.345
I won't let you down.

16:20.347 --> 16:23.414
Good.
Now, keep up the pace.

16:23.416 --> 16:25.616
The bulldozers move in
the moment we close.

16:25.618 --> 16:26.985
Cheers to that.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.226
[suspense music]

17:01.621 --> 17:03.454
Good morning, Hugo. Hi, Nina.

17:03.456 --> 17:05.623
Hi, good morning.
I'm sorry that we're late.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.791
Uh, that's no problem.
Do you have a second?
We need to chat.

17:07.794 --> 17:09.327
Yeah, sure.

17:17.037 --> 17:18.603
So, I don't know
if you're aware

17:18.605 --> 17:21.672
but Hugo's been
a bit aggressive lately.

17:21.674 --> 17:25.777
-What do you mean?
-Well, for starters he stabbed
me with a pencil yesterday.

17:25.779 --> 17:28.179
Oh, my God! Hugo did that?

17:28.181 --> 17:31.082
-I'm so sorry.
-It's an occupational hazard.

17:31.084 --> 17:35.486
-Has anything
changed at home recently?
-No, no, nothing.

17:35.488 --> 17:39.390
Well listen, um,
next year class sizes
increase significantly.

17:39.392 --> 17:43.127
And if anything, Hugo
needs more attention, not less.

17:44.130 --> 17:47.398
-I don't understand.
-It's a much more unstructured
environment

17:47.400 --> 17:49.333
when they move
into the new building.

17:49.335 --> 17:52.437
I'm just not convinced
that Hugo would thrive there.

17:52.439 --> 17:54.105
You want to hold him back?

17:54.107 --> 17:55.807
It would be good for him,
but I can't.

17:55.809 --> 17:57.742
The district
wants kids like Hugo

17:57.744 --> 18:00.778
to flow through the system
as quickly as possible.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.814
Okay, so then what?

18:02.816 --> 18:04.582
Well, there are special schools

18:04.584 --> 18:06.851
designed for students like Hugo.

18:06.853 --> 18:10.521
I think he could really thrive
in one of these programs.

18:11.391 --> 18:14.158
-Private school?
-You're paying
for more attention.

18:15.395 --> 18:17.462
I know it can be expensive,

18:17.464 --> 18:19.597
but there are subsidies
you can apply for.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.833
-How much are they?
-It varies.

18:23.136 --> 18:24.869
-Around 30,000.
-A year?

18:24.871 --> 18:27.638
I know it's a lot.
Just think about it, okay?

18:27.640 --> 18:29.674
It could be
really good for Hugo.

18:29.676 --> 18:31.576
Yeah, okay. Thank you.

18:31.578 --> 18:34.178
Um, I'll figure it out.

18:34.180 --> 18:35.446
Hey, you're not in this alone.

18:49.762 --> 18:52.830
I mean, it is like he
just deleted me from his life.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.601
-Our session's almost over.
-Okay, I just...

18:56.603 --> 18:58.836
got to find this one text 'cause
I think that if you read it,

18:58.838 --> 19:00.605
you'll-- you'll get a feeling.

19:02.208 --> 19:04.275
I don't need to read the text.

19:04.277 --> 19:05.510
I can read the energy.

19:09.782 --> 19:10.848
[sighs]

19:20.693 --> 19:22.927
He's not the one.

19:22.929 --> 19:25.897
I knew it.
He is such an asshole.

19:27.400 --> 19:31.869
-I'm going to die alone.
-No, no.

19:31.871 --> 19:34.238
Another man is going to come
into your life.

19:34.874 --> 19:36.807
A tall, dark--

19:38.878 --> 19:40.244
a better man.

19:40.246 --> 19:41.612
Really?

19:41.614 --> 19:43.548
[door opens]

19:43.550 --> 19:45.449
That must be my next client.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.619
That's going to be fifty.

19:48.621 --> 19:50.755
Oh, my God! Thank you.

19:50.757 --> 19:54.325
I feel so much lighter.
You know what?

19:54.327 --> 19:55.927
I'm deleting his number.

19:57.697 --> 20:00.765
Hmm. Insurance
should really cover this.

20:00.767 --> 20:04.202
You are so much better
than therapy.

20:04.204 --> 20:05.703
Oh... [laughs]

20:14.647 --> 20:16.247
-Ah.
-Excuse me.

20:26.359 --> 20:27.925
-Hi.
-Hi.

20:27.927 --> 20:29.727
You're back.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.495
I didn't know
you could surprise a psychic.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.220
I want you to talk to my wife.

20:39.221 --> 20:40.871
It's not that easy.
I told you, it takes time.

20:40.873 --> 20:46.010
And even if I do, what happens
next is really up to her.

20:47.380 --> 20:49.247
I want to try.

20:49.249 --> 20:51.449
I have to try, please.

20:51.451 --> 20:52.516
I'll pay you.

20:58.358 --> 21:01.959
Mediumship is rare. I can't
predict what it might take

21:01.961 --> 21:03.794
to try to connect with her.

21:03.796 --> 21:07.665
-How much?
-Five hundred for today.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.500
[whistles]

21:09.502 --> 21:10.768
Well, you were right
about one thing,

21:15.742 --> 21:17.358
promotion, money.

21:17.359 --> 21:18.975
The universe is clearing the way
for you to reunite with Maggie.

21:20.847 --> 21:22.546
So, how long
you have been doing this?

21:23.383 --> 21:24.915
I used to watch my mother.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.550
She has the gift, too.

21:27.553 --> 21:29.053
I guess it must run
in the family then, huh?

21:29.055 --> 21:31.289
You can say that.

21:31.291 --> 21:33.624
It's supposed to skip
a generation.

21:33.626 --> 21:36.027
-I guess
you just got lucky then.
-[laughs]

21:36.029 --> 21:37.828
-Are we going to use that?
-[laughs]

21:38.765 --> 21:40.998
Crystals are for looking
into the future.

21:42.902 --> 21:45.736
We are going somewhere else.

21:47.006 --> 21:48.072
Well, does it really work?

21:49.642 --> 21:51.342
If you choose to believe it.

21:51.344 --> 21:57.014
Some people need symbols
like this to create a space
where they can believe.

21:58.051 --> 22:00.384
You and I
don't need those things.

22:00.386 --> 22:01.986
We have real work to do.

22:01.988 --> 22:04.021
[suspense music]

22:26.379 --> 22:27.978
-I don't think
we should do this.
-Why?

22:27.980 --> 22:31.482
-The energy I feel, it's dark.
-Dark?

22:31.484 --> 22:32.850
Angry.

22:34.721 --> 22:36.921
Right now,
Maggie is on the other side.

22:36.923 --> 22:39.023
If we start trying
to connect with her,

22:39.025 --> 22:41.559
I can't promise you
that she's going to stay there.

22:41.561 --> 22:45.496
You mean like she's going to try
and haunt me or something?

22:45.498 --> 22:47.131
I mean I already can't
get her out of my head.

22:47.133 --> 22:49.133
I'm just saying
it's dangerous

22:49.135 --> 22:50.634
to mess with these things.

22:51.671 --> 22:53.637
You have to have
the right intentions.

22:53.639 --> 22:59.643
-You doubt my intentions?
-No. I just want to make sure
that you understand the risks.

22:59.645 --> 23:02.012
I didn't realize
that she would be angry.

23:02.882 --> 23:05.783
Let's keep going, please.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.486
[suspense music continues]

23:17.964 --> 23:19.163
I'm seeing an image,

23:21.868 --> 23:23.100
a woman's face.

23:25.171 --> 23:27.605
It's a drawing, I think.

23:28.574 --> 23:29.640
The painting.

23:31.411 --> 23:32.843
Maggie was an artist.

23:35.548 --> 23:38.449
[upbeat music]

23:42.555 --> 23:45.689
Daniel, thank God you're here.

23:45.691 --> 23:47.057
Welcome to the Freak Show.

23:48.995 --> 23:51.896
Ah, you must be Andrew.
Your father has told me
so much about you.

23:51.898 --> 23:54.532
-Congratulations on your show.
-I know. It's all happening.

23:54.534 --> 23:56.767
It's just like,
"What? I don't understand it."

23:56.769 --> 23:58.769
Dad, if you could move
a few steps back from the art.

23:58.771 --> 24:00.204
There's a vibe
that you're disrupting.

24:01.107 --> 24:02.807
Marcus, uh...

24:05.178 --> 24:07.978
You need a drink.
Where's the bar--?

24:07.980 --> 24:09.180
Oh, here. Grab one of these.

24:10.116 --> 24:11.916
Yeah.

24:11.918 --> 24:15.186
[huffs]
Yeah, you know, mix, mingle,

24:15.188 --> 24:17.555
look at the... art.

24:28.868 --> 24:30.901
[woman] This is great.

24:30.903 --> 24:33.037
I'm working on it for a while.

24:33.039 --> 24:35.940
Sure. It's a metaphor.

24:35.942 --> 24:40.945
[man] We call her mentor.
I mean he said
next proper option but...

24:40.947 --> 24:42.213
[woman]
Do you paint a lot of this?

24:42.215 --> 24:44.114
[man] I do. It's a metaphor.

24:44.116 --> 24:46.484
-[woman] Great.
-Yes.

24:46.486 --> 24:49.220
Excuse me.
It was nice seeing you again.

24:49.222 --> 24:53.057
Oh, my gosh! I am so sorry.

24:53.059 --> 24:55.826
It's fine. Well, it's my fault.
Are you alright?

24:55.828 --> 24:58.062
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine
but look at your shirt.

24:58.064 --> 25:00.931
Oh, no, no. it's fine.
Don't-- don't worry about it.

25:00.933 --> 25:03.234
I'm very worried about it.

25:05.137 --> 25:08.205
-Here, come with me.
-Oh, Maggie!

25:08.207 --> 25:10.841
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'll-- I'll be right back.

25:10.843 --> 25:13.143
Oh, I'm such a klutz sometimes.

25:20.753 --> 25:22.086
Oh, God.

25:22.088 --> 25:23.153
That painting...

25:24.123 --> 25:26.023
the faces out there,
that's yours?

25:29.629 --> 25:31.229
It's hideous, right?

25:31.230 --> 25:32.830
I was going to say
more like haunting.

25:35.868 --> 25:37.034
You're very talented.

25:38.704 --> 25:41.005
Well, I didn't mean
to make you my next canvas.

25:41.874 --> 25:44.575
[sighs] That stain
is going to set.

25:44.577 --> 25:46.043
You need
to take that off.

25:46.045 --> 25:47.845
-Uh, what?
-Your shirt.

25:47.847 --> 25:49.880
Take it off.
So we can soak it.

25:49.882 --> 25:54.118
I-- I don't think that-- okay.

25:54.120 --> 25:55.319
Okay.

26:03.963 --> 26:05.029
[sighs]

26:08.167 --> 26:10.935
I'm sorry.
I just need a minute.

26:12.038 --> 26:13.571
It's a bit much out there.

26:13.573 --> 26:14.872
[knocking on door]

26:14.874 --> 26:16.206
Someone's in here.

26:17.076 --> 26:19.176
Um-- I'm Daniel, by the way.

26:20.780 --> 26:21.845
Daniel.

26:23.249 --> 26:25.182
Daniel. Hi.

26:29.789 --> 26:31.922
I don't think
that's going to work by the way.

26:31.924 --> 26:34.191
-What?
-I don't think
it's going to be dry.

26:35.695 --> 26:38.596
Shit! Yeah. Um--

26:38.598 --> 26:41.298
I didn't really think
this through.

26:41.300 --> 26:44.034
-Oh, here.
-I don't think it's going to--

26:44.036 --> 26:45.703
No, no, no, no, no.
It will, it will.

26:45.705 --> 26:47.338
I just have
to wring it all out.

26:47.340 --> 26:49.740
-[knocking on door]
-I said just a minute.

26:49.742 --> 26:51.308
[man] Honey,
are you in there?

26:51.310 --> 26:53.978
That Freeze writer
wants to talk to you.

26:53.980 --> 26:57.681
Um, okay. I'm coming.

26:57.683 --> 27:00.050
Um, sorry,
I-- I have to go.

27:00.052 --> 27:01.352
What about my shirt?

27:01.354 --> 27:04.021
Um, well, figure it out.

27:04.023 --> 27:05.789
-[knocking]
-Maggie, he's leaving.

27:05.791 --> 27:07.691
Okay, I'm coming.

27:07.693 --> 27:08.759
Um...

27:21.907 --> 27:23.340
It was nice meeting you, Daniel.

27:28.014 --> 27:29.680
[suspense music]

27:34.387 --> 27:37.221
Hey, these are for sale, right?

27:39.225 --> 27:40.290
[Nina] She's gone.

27:42.428 --> 27:44.228
Um, like-- like gone gone?

27:44.230 --> 27:46.664
-For now.
-I want more time.

27:47.933 --> 27:50.067
It doesn't work like that.

27:50.069 --> 27:53.370
On her terms.
She guides the sessions.

27:53.372 --> 27:55.806
Why do you think that she wanted
you to remember that?

27:55.808 --> 27:57.007
I don't know.

27:57.009 --> 27:58.909
Will she come back?

27:58.911 --> 27:59.977
Uh, not today.

28:01.113 --> 28:02.179
So that's it?

28:03.015 --> 28:04.748
Maggie sent you a message.

28:05.885 --> 28:07.351
Focus on that.

28:09.422 --> 28:10.721
See where it takes you.

28:13.993 --> 28:16.093
[suspense music]

28:36.982 --> 28:39.216
[suspense music continues]

28:49.295 --> 28:51.929
-Do you feel that?
-What?

28:53.032 --> 28:54.164
A spirit.

28:55.334 --> 28:57.334
Oh, yeah?
Who is it this time?

28:58.871 --> 28:59.937
I don't know her.

29:03.509 --> 29:05.909
Alright, Hugo. Take a pit stop.

29:05.911 --> 29:07.511
You got to go brush your teeth.

29:11.751 --> 29:13.851
Alright,
can you say goodnight to Nana?

29:14.887 --> 29:16.820
That's not Hugo.

29:18.290 --> 29:21.325
Alright. Let's turn this off.

29:22.394 --> 29:25.929
And they all lived
happily ever after.

29:25.931 --> 29:27.297
The end.

29:29.168 --> 29:31.502
Alright,
time to go to sleep, baby.

29:34.240 --> 29:35.339
I love you.

29:52.258 --> 29:53.857
[Maggie laughing]

29:56.395 --> 29:57.961
Just leave it.

30:10.342 --> 30:13.110
[panting]

30:18.117 --> 30:20.083
[both laugh]

30:24.456 --> 30:25.923
Take off your pants.

31:00.526 --> 31:01.625
What are you doing?

31:03.429 --> 31:04.561
I'm feeling inspired.

31:19.278 --> 31:20.510
[sighs]

31:38.297 --> 31:39.897
We should go away.

31:44.904 --> 31:46.570
Oh, we could go lay
on the beach.

31:46.572 --> 31:48.238
Let's go to Tulum.

31:49.074 --> 31:51.375
Tulum, let's go.
What do you say?

31:51.377 --> 31:52.676
It sound--

31:55.014 --> 31:58.982
that sounds like a nice idea,
but I can't really go away
right now.

31:58.984 --> 32:02.152
My gallerist will kill me
if I don't have something
to show at the end of the month.

32:03.122 --> 32:04.187
Oh, right.

32:11.563 --> 32:12.629
Do you mind?

32:12.631 --> 32:16.466
It's just really hard to work
while I'm being watched.

32:16.468 --> 32:17.634
Oh.

32:20.539 --> 32:22.039
Oh, do you want me to go?

32:23.575 --> 32:25.676
Sorry. Is that horrible?

32:25.678 --> 32:28.278
I just feel a real creative
burst coming on.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.614
Oh, you...

32:32.651 --> 32:37.020
feeling somewhat inspired
right now?

32:38.490 --> 32:40.290
By me?

32:40.292 --> 32:44.461
Like-- like your muse
or something?

32:44.463 --> 32:47.631
Sure. That's one way
of thinking about it.

32:52.604 --> 32:54.972
I don't ever want to be
apart from you, Maggie.

32:56.075 --> 32:58.208
You're so sweet.

33:00.713 --> 33:05.449
Look, Daniel, um, you know,
we've been having a lot of fun,

33:05.451 --> 33:07.351
-but--
-Oh.

33:07.353 --> 33:09.486
But I really need to focus
on my work right now.

33:09.488 --> 33:12.122
-It's everything to me.
-Stop. Please, stop.

33:12.124 --> 33:14.191
One day I'll be ready
to settle down,

33:14.193 --> 33:16.994
but now I get to put
my work first.

33:16.996 --> 33:19.262
And I'm so grateful for that.

33:20.265 --> 33:21.465
Can you understand?

33:24.069 --> 33:25.268
What are you saying?

33:27.673 --> 33:31.475
Things have just been getting
really intense.

33:32.711 --> 33:36.747
Why don't we just take
a minute and let things
cool off for a bit

33:36.749 --> 33:39.349
and then see how we feel?

33:39.351 --> 33:42.219
Why? I know how I feel.

33:44.156 --> 33:46.189
I love you.

33:46.191 --> 33:47.657
You barely know me.

33:51.096 --> 33:54.498
Sorry, I-- I didn't
mean it like that.

33:54.500 --> 33:57.367
Look, I told you I wasn't
looking for anything serious.

33:59.571 --> 34:02.672
-I knew it the first moment
I ever saw you, Maggie.
-Daniel--

34:02.674 --> 34:04.508
When I saw your painting--

34:04.510 --> 34:06.543
See, this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

34:06.545 --> 34:08.445
You're being
way too intense.

34:08.447 --> 34:10.813
You're forcing me
into this conversation with you

34:10.815 --> 34:13.617
and I just want to put
this energy into my work.

34:13.619 --> 34:15.418
I just told you I love you.

34:16.522 --> 34:18.554
Daniel...

34:19.525 --> 34:24.194
Look... Why don't we just
forget about it, okay?

34:25.197 --> 34:27.063
We can talk about it later.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.532
I really have to work.

34:29.668 --> 34:31.835
-So you really want me to go?
-[sighs]

34:31.837 --> 34:34.237
You're ruining this.

34:35.741 --> 34:38.475
Yeah, yeah,
I really want you to go.

34:39.511 --> 34:43.480
Here... please.

34:47.585 --> 34:50.353
-Why that?
-What?

34:54.626 --> 34:56.493
Why do you want to hear
about that?

34:56.495 --> 34:59.362
It has nothing to do with me.

34:59.364 --> 35:01.164
Maggie wanted
you to revisit it.

35:02.234 --> 35:04.434
Not every memory
can be a happy one.

35:04.436 --> 35:06.603
Yeah, well that was a long time
ago. We got through it.

35:08.640 --> 35:13.443
You know I'm not paying you
to relive the worst memories
of my marriage.

35:13.445 --> 35:15.612
I thought you wanted
to reconnect with Maggie.

35:15.614 --> 35:18.281
I mean... isn't that
why we're here?

35:18.283 --> 35:19.449
Yeah, well that wasn't her.

35:20.319 --> 35:22.152
She wasn't like that.

35:22.154 --> 35:23.286
She loved me.

35:25.124 --> 35:26.289
This isn't good enough.

35:26.291 --> 35:27.891
We're done.

35:27.893 --> 35:29.793
You, obviously,
can't handle her.

35:29.795 --> 35:32.195
This is not enough for me.

35:32.197 --> 35:33.697
I can try to channel her,

35:35.134 --> 35:36.633
but it's not easy work.

35:39.705 --> 35:40.770
What's it going to take?

35:42.274 --> 35:44.574
-Just give me the number.
-Ten thousand.

35:47.513 --> 35:49.779
Here, this is for today.

35:51.416 --> 35:52.716
Sorry about your store.

36:30.689 --> 36:32.689
[tension music]

36:47.773 --> 36:48.838
-Maggie?
-Ah!

36:50.542 --> 36:54.778
I'm sorry. I thought you were--
never mind.

37:01.687 --> 37:05.622
-Nina! Oh, hi. Is Nina here?
-No.

37:05.624 --> 37:08.225
Are you packing up already?
You still have
two weeks on the lease.

37:08.227 --> 37:11.294
Huh? Do you see any clients?
The only thing left here
is your construction.

37:11.296 --> 37:13.763
-Will she be back soon?
-No.

37:13.765 --> 37:16.633
-I really need to see her.
-Well, I don't know.

37:16.635 --> 37:19.336
Maybe she thought
you weren't coming back
after your last session.

37:19.338 --> 37:21.905
-Do you know where she is?
-I don't know.

37:21.907 --> 37:24.708
-You don't know where she is?
-Oh, I know where she is.

37:24.710 --> 37:26.376
I don't know
if I want to tell you.

37:26.378 --> 37:28.445
Please, I really need
to find her.

37:28.447 --> 37:31.581
I did everything she said
and I have what she asked for.

37:31.583 --> 37:36.786
Oh. Well, do you think
I need to bubble-wrap her?

37:38.557 --> 37:40.957
Are you going to tell me
where to find her or not?

37:40.959 --> 37:44.461
Dude, you are throwing me
out of my shop.

37:44.463 --> 37:46.396
Have you thought
about where I'm going to go?

37:46.398 --> 37:48.865
What I'm going to do?
Have you thought about Nina?

37:50.402 --> 37:52.369
[suspense music]

38:07.019 --> 38:08.585
You're a lifesaver.

38:09.488 --> 38:11.288
Lucky number seven
takes the lead,

38:11.290 --> 38:13.490
but Big Red
is hot on its heels

38:13.492 --> 38:15.859
and we're at the finish line.

38:15.861 --> 38:19.729
It's Big Red!
Big Red is the winner!

38:19.731 --> 38:23.633
Oh, the crowd goes wild.

38:23.635 --> 38:26.369
Mom, the crowd goes wild.

38:26.371 --> 38:27.570
Clap your hands, Mom.

38:28.774 --> 38:31.841
Alright.

38:34.012 --> 38:35.845
Can you clean up
your toys for me?

38:35.847 --> 38:38.014
Cookies are going to be ready
in five minutes.

38:41.320 --> 38:42.752
[knocking on door]

38:45.557 --> 38:47.457
Hugo, can you get that for me?

38:52.964 --> 38:55.365
Oh, hey, little man.

38:55.367 --> 38:56.599
Do you remember me?

39:00.472 --> 39:02.872
-Hi.
-Hugo, go play with your toys.

39:05.010 --> 39:07.944
-What are you doing here?
-I had to see you.

39:07.946 --> 39:10.380
I have to see Maggie.
I've got the money.

39:10.382 --> 39:12.115
You shouldn't be here.

39:12.117 --> 39:15.018
Look, I'm sorry that
I got frustrated or whatever.

39:15.020 --> 39:17.787
I shouldn't have left
things like that
between us the other day.

39:18.924 --> 39:23.760
This work, what we're doing,
this is--
this is important to me.

39:23.762 --> 39:25.462
Please.

39:26.732 --> 39:28.098
-[alarm rings]
-Shit!

39:29.368 --> 39:31.935
[Hugo moans]

39:45.617 --> 39:48.685
Sweetie, it's okay. Sh.

39:59.097 --> 40:01.064
Sweetie, I'm going to be
right back, okay?

40:01.066 --> 40:02.399
Can you stay with Nana?

40:16.982 --> 40:18.915
-You can't just show up here.
-I'm sorry.

40:18.917 --> 40:22.619
I needed to see you.
Here, the first half.

40:22.621 --> 40:23.987
Consider it a down payment.

40:28.093 --> 40:29.159
So, you'll do it?

40:31.630 --> 40:33.663
I don't have my studio anymore.

40:33.665 --> 40:34.864
We can use my house.

40:35.867 --> 40:36.966
Good.

40:36.968 --> 40:39.035
Can we do it now?

40:39.037 --> 40:41.504
I need time to prepare.

40:41.506 --> 40:43.940
I see her everywhere.

40:44.776 --> 40:46.709
That means that she's ready.

40:50.649 --> 40:51.714
Okay.

41:37.529 --> 41:38.895
Just talk to her.

41:46.071 --> 41:47.737
[suspense music]

41:47.739 --> 41:53.276
Um, Maggie... um.

41:54.546 --> 41:55.612
Are you there?

41:58.149 --> 41:59.983
I'd really like
to talk to you, babe.

42:05.257 --> 42:06.723
She's here with us.

42:06.725 --> 42:09.993
[thunder rumbling]

42:11.630 --> 42:12.695
[door closes]

42:12.697 --> 42:17.534
Maggie, we call upon you tonight
to reconnect you with Daniel

42:17.536 --> 42:19.569
from whom you were taken
too soon.

42:21.540 --> 42:24.107
We open up this channel
for you to return.

42:25.710 --> 42:27.243
My body is your vessel

42:28.780 --> 42:30.680
and I yield it willingly.

42:34.853 --> 42:37.086
Do you have the message?

42:37.088 --> 42:38.321
You have to write it down.

42:38.323 --> 42:40.757
[thunder rumbling]

42:43.995 --> 42:45.762
Don't tell me what it says.

42:53.305 --> 42:54.571
Now what?

43:08.119 --> 43:09.319
[suspense music continues]

43:10.855 --> 43:11.955
Now we're ready.

43:16.661 --> 43:17.727
Arms up.

43:19.297 --> 43:20.363
Oh, uh.

43:26.271 --> 43:27.770
We have to be closer.

43:29.007 --> 43:30.707
Move behind me.

43:36.815 --> 43:38.147
-Like this?
-Closer.

43:42.921 --> 43:44.821
[tension music]

43:49.661 --> 43:51.694
-[choking]
-Whoa! Nina, breathe.

43:51.696 --> 43:55.732
Nina, Nina, help.
Nina, what can I do?

43:57.035 --> 43:58.101
What's wrong?

43:58.970 --> 44:01.704
Nina? Nina. Oh, my God!

44:03.308 --> 44:07.210
Nina, can you hear me?
Nina. Nina, breathe.

44:07.212 --> 44:08.945
Fuck. Breathe.

44:10.415 --> 44:11.848
Shit.

44:14.719 --> 44:17.754
[thunder rumbling]

44:20.692 --> 44:22.825
Nina? Nina, breathe.

44:23.862 --> 44:25.294
Nina, can you hear me?

44:30.735 --> 44:33.036
[suspense music]

44:40.078 --> 44:41.144
Maggie?

44:59.364 --> 45:03.766
[both panting]

45:15.747 --> 45:17.747
-Maggie.
-[panting]

45:21.853 --> 45:24.020
[both panting]

45:38.169 --> 45:39.235
Maggie.

45:45.944 --> 45:47.176
[suspense music continues]

45:55.186 --> 45:58.521
[Nina panting] Fuck.

46:14.506 --> 46:15.772
Maggie.

46:19.778 --> 46:21.477
I have a headache.

46:21.479 --> 46:23.012
That was...

46:23.848 --> 46:25.448
I can't believe
you're here with me.

46:25.450 --> 46:28.050
Daniel, it's me, Nina.

46:29.788 --> 46:30.853
Nina?

46:31.823 --> 46:34.023
-Maggie's gone.
-What? No.

46:34.025 --> 46:36.859
-Already?
-Sorry to disappoint you.

46:36.861 --> 46:39.362
-Well can you bring her back?
-I'm going to be sick.

46:40.965 --> 46:42.398
-[throws up]
-Sorry.

46:47.338 --> 46:49.806
Uh, can I--?

46:51.409 --> 46:53.476
Are you okay?
Can I get you something?

46:56.381 --> 47:00.883
You know,
I didn't know-- was that--

47:01.953 --> 47:03.853
I don't know, was that--
was that okay?

47:03.855 --> 47:05.488
I didn't know she would, uh..

47:06.558 --> 47:08.357
you know, that we--

47:08.359 --> 47:10.092
I didn't know
that was going to happen.

47:11.296 --> 47:13.095
You two have
an intense connection.

47:13.965 --> 47:15.264
I felt it before.

47:17.001 --> 47:18.935
When I invite her in I--

47:19.904 --> 47:21.571
I can't control
what's going to happen.

47:24.042 --> 47:25.141
Okay.

47:27.879 --> 47:29.612
Oh, shit, I have to go.

47:32.851 --> 47:35.418
I want to do it again--
see her again.

47:35.420 --> 47:36.953
We can get her back.
It's just--

47:38.456 --> 47:40.256
it'll be harder, you know.

47:40.258 --> 47:43.259
-It'll take more time.
-Whatever it takes.

47:46.564 --> 47:48.264
I really have to go.

47:49.467 --> 47:50.533
Right.

47:55.073 --> 47:56.138
Nina...

47:58.376 --> 47:59.442
thank you.

48:05.016 --> 48:06.082
[suspense music]

48:37.081 --> 48:40.182
[Daniel laughs]

48:41.452 --> 48:45.288
Yeah? I hear you.

48:46.157 --> 48:47.423
And I understand that.

48:48.526 --> 48:51.060
Yeah, I'm not going below 1.7.

48:51.062 --> 48:53.162
I've got a wait list a mile long
for this property.

48:56.267 --> 48:59.635
[sighs] Right. You go back
to your clients with 1.8.

48:59.637 --> 49:01.237
They come in at 1 7,
we got a deal.

49:02.707 --> 49:05.608
No, you've got till the end
of the day. Yeah.

49:09.948 --> 49:12.415
That-- that is how
you make that money.

49:12.417 --> 49:15.351
That is how you make that money!

49:15.353 --> 49:16.485
-[laughs]
-Woohooho!

49:18.156 --> 49:20.022
Oh, so, uh,
your bank just called.

49:20.024 --> 49:22.591
Um, they said that
your wire transfer came through.

49:22.593 --> 49:25.561
I wasn't sure if it was
your bank or the company bank.

49:25.563 --> 49:28.531
I didn't want to say
because I know that

49:28.533 --> 49:31.167
you want me to sound
like I know what I'm talking
about on the phone.

49:31.169 --> 49:34.270
Yeah, right.
Um, that's a personal thing.

49:34.272 --> 49:36.072
If they call again,
just put it through to me.

49:36.074 --> 49:37.740
You got it, Mr. Vice President.

49:50.989 --> 49:52.088
[phone chimes]

49:54.726 --> 49:57.193
I always knew
you're going to land a big one.

49:57.195 --> 50:01.030
So, is it you or is it her?

50:01.766 --> 50:05.568
Whatever the way I see it,
it's all healing.

50:07.071 --> 50:08.337
He's very demanding.

50:10.141 --> 50:11.640
It's pretty
exhausting actually.

50:11.642 --> 50:14.343
Well, manual labor will do that.

50:15.580 --> 50:17.680
What are you going to do
with all the money honey?

50:17.682 --> 50:21.751
-Hugo's new school
and God, a nurse for mom.
-Hmm.

50:21.753 --> 50:24.120
If I could find anybody
that she won't drive away.

50:24.122 --> 50:27.723
And you, I'm going to get all
of that back that I owe you.

50:27.725 --> 50:29.592
Oh, girlfriend, please.

50:29.594 --> 50:32.228
It all comes out
in the wash.

50:32.230 --> 50:34.030
I do have to say that

50:34.032 --> 50:35.798
[whispers] all that sex has done

50:35.800 --> 50:38.701
wonders for your complexion.
You glow, girl.

50:38.703 --> 50:41.537
-Stop.
-What? It's been so long.

50:41.539 --> 50:44.040
I thought
you forgot how to do it.

50:44.042 --> 50:46.208
This looks good on you.

51:46.404 --> 51:47.470
It's okay.

51:49.474 --> 51:51.674
Hugo, how's it going?

51:51.676 --> 51:54.176
Are you getting busy
in there? Huh?

52:05.189 --> 52:08.424
Oh, not your usual.

52:10.428 --> 52:11.794
You're branching out.

52:11.795 --> 52:13.161
Well, all great artists
go through phases.

52:13.164 --> 52:14.530
It's a sign of growth.

53:44.422 --> 53:46.255
Please,
don't leave me this time.

53:49.894 --> 53:53.429
I knew from the first moment
I ever saw you

53:55.800 --> 53:58.300
we were meant
to be together forever.

54:02.673 --> 54:04.607
[suspense music]

54:09.513 --> 54:15.251
Hugo. Hugo. Are you alright?

54:15.253 --> 54:16.418
What's happening?

54:16.420 --> 54:19.788
-Oh! Uh!
-[hit]

54:29.500 --> 54:31.267
I can't do this anymore.

54:38.542 --> 54:39.875
We have to end this.

54:41.512 --> 54:42.645
Why?

54:52.857 --> 54:53.922
She is gone.

54:56.727 --> 54:58.661
You have to let her go.

55:01.666 --> 55:02.731
No.

55:03.934 --> 55:05.934
-Daniel.
-No, I said no.

55:05.936 --> 55:07.069
Daniel.

55:10.808 --> 55:12.975
You know what it was
an intense session today.

55:14.078 --> 55:17.646
-Let's talk about this later.
-No. No. This isn't over.

55:17.648 --> 55:19.381
Daniel.

55:21.986 --> 55:23.652
Maggie wants it to be over.

55:24.522 --> 55:28.090
No. No. No, no, no.
That wasn't the deal.

55:29.860 --> 55:31.827
She wants to be with me

55:32.930 --> 55:35.497
and I can't live without her.

55:35.499 --> 55:37.833
Daniel, I have a life.

55:37.835 --> 55:39.535
I can't be here all the time.

55:39.537 --> 55:41.637
She's my wife. She is--

55:42.740 --> 55:44.006
[crying] She is my wife.

55:47.044 --> 55:50.412
[sobbing] I need you
to help me be with her.

55:52.383 --> 55:53.449
Please.

55:54.118 --> 55:55.484
Ple--

55:55.486 --> 55:56.652
-I'm sorry.
-Please.

55:56.654 --> 55:57.886
I have to go.

55:57.888 --> 55:59.421
You're just going to leave?

56:11.469 --> 56:14.503
Oh, my God! Jro! Jro!

56:14.505 --> 56:16.538
[tension music]

56:52.710 --> 56:53.776
[phone chimes]

57:23.541 --> 57:26.642
[phone chimes]

57:28.679 --> 57:32.681
Peter, hey, hey. Oh, no, no,
everything's perfect.

57:32.683 --> 57:34.983
Yeah, we are set to start demo
tomorrow morning, man.

57:34.985 --> 57:37.553
We're going to knock
this bitch down.

57:37.555 --> 57:39.755
I got some bad news, Daniel.

57:39.757 --> 57:42.090
We're going to have to pull
the plug on the redevelopment.

57:42.092 --> 57:46.595
-What? Why?
-The bank has frozen
all pending loans.

57:46.597 --> 57:49.698
They're being investigated
by the state.

57:50.868 --> 57:53.836
<i> -We've lost our funding.</i>
-But I have bulldozers
there right now.

57:53.838 --> 57:55.871
We're starting demo
tomorrow morning.

57:55.873 --> 57:59.508
What's the value on the land
without the new structure?

57:59.510 --> 58:01.710
We might have to do a short
sale on the property.

58:01.712 --> 58:04.646
Uh... not even half.

58:05.516 --> 58:07.716
Peter, I've been working
on this for months.

58:07.718 --> 58:11.820
Look, that's the business.
This shit happens.

58:11.822 --> 58:14.122
Well, you're taking this
awfully philosophically.

58:14.124 --> 58:16.191
<i> Dude, I took a Valium.</i>

58:16.193 --> 58:19.928
Look, knock it down,
don't, I don't care.

58:19.930 --> 58:22.731
Just get this albatross
off my books.

58:22.733 --> 58:24.933
My masseuse is here,
I got to go.

58:24.935 --> 58:26.068
Peter.

58:31.075 --> 58:34.076
[suspense music]

58:55.766 --> 58:56.832
Fuck.

59:18.188 --> 59:19.321
God.

59:29.266 --> 59:34.303
[laughs]

59:35.773 --> 59:39.007
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

59:40.277 --> 59:45.914
Oh my-- [laughs]

59:45.916 --> 59:47.282
Oh, fuck.

59:48.118 --> 59:49.952
[doorbell rings]

59:52.756 --> 59:56.258
Right now, hmm.
Who the fuck is this?

01:00:00.297 --> 01:00:01.363
What?

01:00:17.014 --> 01:00:20.349
-His health proxy?
-[woman] <i> He chose you</i>
<i> to make decisions for him</i>

01:00:20.351 --> 01:00:22.384

01:00:22.386 --> 01:00:25.387
[Nina] <i> How is he? Is-- is he</i>
<i> going into surgery or--</i>

01:00:25.389 --> 01:00:27.856
[woman] <i> We are taking him</i>
<i> into the OR shortly.</i>

01:00:27.858 --> 01:00:30.659
<i> You'll have to wait</i>
<i> for an update from the doctor.</i>

01:00:31.362 --> 01:00:33.795
<i> Do you know if he has</i>
<i> any supplemental insurance,</i>

01:00:33.797 --> 01:00:36.832
<i> -long-term care policies?</i>
-No. No, he--

01:00:38.936 --> 01:00:40.702
he doesn't believe in insurance.

01:00:41.338 --> 01:00:44.039
<i> Did he set anything</i>
<i> aside for an emergency?</i>

01:00:51.115 --> 01:00:53.315
[Nina] <i> I'll take care of it.</i>

01:00:53.317 --> 01:00:55.183
Whatever it is,
just give him the best.

01:00:55.185 --> 01:00:56.818
<i>It's going to be very expensive.</i>

01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:58.120
I'll take care of it.

01:00:58.122 --> 01:01:02.324
<i> Okay. I'll need your billing</i>
<i> information, please.</i>

01:01:06.397 --> 01:01:07.996
[phone tone]

01:01:09.333 --> 01:01:11.900
<i> -Hi, this is Nina,</i>
<i> leave a message.</i>
-Damn it.

01:01:17.074 --> 01:01:18.440
[knocks on door]

01:01:18.442 --> 01:01:19.708
[Daniel] What?

01:01:21.311 --> 01:01:23.745
-Everything alright in here?
-Fine. What is it?

01:01:23.747 --> 01:01:25.714
Peter wants to see you
immediately in his office.

01:01:25.716 --> 01:01:27.849
-He says it's urgent.
-Tell him I'll be right there.

01:01:27.851 --> 01:01:30.185
-He wants you now.
-I said I'll be right there.

01:01:30.187 --> 01:01:31.253
Okay.

01:01:31.255 --> 01:01:34.790
Oh, my God, I remember
what I wanted to tell you.

01:01:34.792 --> 01:01:36.758
I heard the most random thing
last night.

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:39.928
Do you remember that girl
Mallory at my art show?

01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:43.131
-Didn't-- didn't you guys
hook up? Anyway--
-Maggie.

01:01:45.703 --> 01:01:47.235
Her name was Maggie.

01:01:47.237 --> 01:01:49.738
Right. She died.

01:01:51.975 --> 01:01:56.244
I had no idea. I totally
thought she moved to L.A.
and got famous or something.

01:01:56.246 --> 01:01:58.447
Oh, she was so talented.

01:01:58.449 --> 01:02:00.382
Of course, she died young.
I should have done that.

01:02:00.384 --> 01:02:04.286
-[suspense music]
-Oh, so sad.

01:02:05.122 --> 01:02:06.388
Did you know?

01:02:13.464 --> 01:02:14.730
Bye.

01:02:46.463 --> 01:02:49.464
Hey. Andrew said you needed
to see me right away.

01:02:49.466 --> 01:02:53.502
Daniel, come in.
Shut the door. Take a seat.

01:02:54.404 --> 01:02:55.904
What's going on?

01:02:58.842 --> 01:03:02.010
-Daniel, this is Marlene,
our lawyer.
-Hello, Daniel.

01:03:02.012 --> 01:03:05.280
-I'm here to witness
your meeting.
-An innocent bystander.

01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:09.484
Daniel, I received a phone call
last night from our accountant.

01:03:10.387 --> 01:03:12.954
At first I thought
that there must be some mistake

01:03:12.956 --> 01:03:14.222
but he assures me he's certain.

01:03:15.959 --> 01:03:18.527
-Does this surprise you?
-Do you recognize
these transfers

01:03:18.529 --> 01:03:20.428
from the Tenth Street
redevelopment fund?

01:03:22.266 --> 01:03:25.200
-I-- I don't know.
-They appear to have been wired

01:03:25.202 --> 01:03:27.202
into an account
belonging to you.

01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:35.977
-Peter, may I speak
with you privately?
-I'm sorry,

01:03:35.979 --> 01:03:39.281
-it's impossible.
-Peter... Please.

01:03:51.161 --> 01:03:53.862
-What were you thinking?
-It was only supposed to be

01:03:53.864 --> 01:03:57.098
in advance on my commission
when the funding fell through.

01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:58.400
I was going to put it back.

01:03:58.402 --> 01:04:00.202
Why didn't you come to me?

01:04:00.204 --> 01:04:03.605
I-- I couldn't.
Look, I can fix this.

01:04:03.607 --> 01:04:06.341
-I'll get it back.
-Daniel, it's too late.

01:04:06.343 --> 01:04:08.610
No. It was a mistake.
I can get it all back.

01:04:08.612 --> 01:04:10.111
I can get it back.
Peter, please,

01:04:10.113 --> 01:04:11.446
just give me this chance.

01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:14.583
Please.

01:04:18.989 --> 01:04:22.357
Either the money's back
in the account by the end of day

01:04:22.359 --> 01:04:25.093
or I'm calling the police.
That's all I can do.

01:04:27.898 --> 01:04:29.464
Thank you, Peter.

01:04:29.466 --> 01:04:31.900
Thank you.
You won't regret it.

01:04:31.902 --> 01:04:33.935
I regret ever hiring you.

01:04:34.872 --> 01:04:37.572
-[sighs]
-I trusted you, Daniel.

01:04:37.574 --> 01:04:39.608
-Peter, I--
-I don't want to know about it.

01:04:44.248 --> 01:04:46.414
And Daniel, it goes
without saying but...

01:04:47.584 --> 01:04:48.884
you're fired.

01:04:49.519 --> 01:04:53.088
Make sure you only
take what's yours.

01:05:31.428 --> 01:05:33.094

[indistinct chatter]

01:07:41.358 --> 01:07:44.259
-Nina, I need to talk to you.
-What are you doing here?

01:07:44.261 --> 01:07:48.129
-Daniel, you cannot show up
at my son's school like this.
-I know, sorry. I can explain.

01:07:48.131 --> 01:07:51.399
-You wanted to reconnect
with your wife. You got that.
-Look, it wasn't my money.

01:07:51.401 --> 01:07:53.802
-What are you talking about?
-It was supposed to be mine.

01:07:53.804 --> 01:07:56.304
The deal, it fell through.
Some issue with the bank.

01:07:56.306 --> 01:07:58.506
-We're getting our store back?
-No. We're still
knocking it down

01:07:58.508 --> 01:08:00.475
and selling the lot.
It's an eyesore.

01:08:00.477 --> 01:08:02.644
Look, I advanced
myself my commission

01:08:02.646 --> 01:08:04.712
from the sale of the lot
to pay you.

01:08:04.714 --> 01:08:06.848
I'm not getting that now. Do you
understand what I'm saying?

01:08:06.850 --> 01:08:10.085
Yes. And I already told you
no refunds.

01:08:10.087 --> 01:08:12.520
Nina, you--
you have to help me with this.

01:08:12.522 --> 01:08:15.523
I'm sorry, Daniel.
This has nothing to do with me.

01:08:15.525 --> 01:08:18.693
It has everything to do
with you. You dragged me back
in that studio for the reading.

01:08:18.694 --> 01:08:21.830
I didn't make you do anything.
And, by the way,
I don't have my studio anymore

01:08:21.832 --> 01:08:24.466
-because you kicked us out.
-Nina, if I don't replace
that money,

01:08:24.468 --> 01:08:26.267
I'm going to go to jail.

01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:28.569
-I don't have it.
-What?

01:08:28.572 --> 01:08:31.840
-You couldn't possibly
have spent ninety thousand.
-I have expenses.

01:08:33.343 --> 01:08:34.408
Hugo!

01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:43.518
Hey, little buddy. Hi.
You don't remember me?

01:08:44.854 --> 01:08:47.788
I'll get your money, right?
It's the only thing.
I'll pay you back.

01:08:47.791 --> 01:08:50.158
I just need you to lend me
that money back now.

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:52.260
I already told you
I don't have it.

01:08:52.261 --> 01:08:54.796
-This conversation is over.
-You sound like fucking Maggie.

01:08:54.798 --> 01:08:57.298
I am not fucking Maggie.

01:08:58.201 --> 01:09:00.401
Excuse me,
are you here for a pickup?

01:09:00.403 --> 01:09:02.203
-[suspense music]
-What?

01:09:02.205 --> 01:09:04.171
Are you here for a pickup?

01:09:04.174 --> 01:09:09.644
Come on, sweetie. Get in.
Get in, get in, get in.

01:09:11.214 --> 01:09:12.479
No.

01:09:17.187 --> 01:09:18.653
I'm sorry.

01:09:44.581 --> 01:09:45.913
[crash]

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:57.425
Mom. It's getting cold.
Do you want your sweater?

01:09:57.427 --> 01:10:00.895
-Oh, I'm fine.
-Let me help you.

01:10:00.897 --> 01:10:02.397
I can do it.

01:10:07.537 --> 01:10:10.905
Nina, go back
and do your homework.

01:10:10.907 --> 01:10:13.374
Can't you see
clients are waiting for me?

01:10:14.678 --> 01:10:16.344
I don't want you watching TV.

01:10:18.515 --> 01:10:22.283
-[crying] Mom.
-Baby, what is it?

01:10:32.596 --> 01:10:34.696
I think I made a big mistake.

01:10:36.333 --> 01:10:37.398
That man.

01:10:38.702 --> 01:10:41.903
-What?
-That man,
he came to this place.

01:10:41.905 --> 01:10:43.504
You remember him?

01:10:46.810 --> 01:10:52.847
Mom, did you ever go
too far with a client?

01:10:52.849 --> 01:10:56.584
I did what I had to
for my family.

01:10:57.821 --> 01:11:01.589
I have a daughter. I want
her to go to a good school.

01:11:04.828 --> 01:11:06.661
I had a lover once.

01:11:08.732 --> 01:11:12.734
He came to me.
He had lost his daughter.

01:11:12.736 --> 01:11:15.003
She was abducted.
It was in the paper.

01:11:16.673 --> 01:11:18.740
He wanted to reconnect
with her.

01:11:20.343 --> 01:11:21.743
He felt responsible.

01:11:22.612 --> 01:11:25.413
He asked me
if I would help him.

01:11:26.516 --> 01:11:27.582
Did you do it?

01:11:29.586 --> 01:11:32.287
[sighs] I couldn't find her.

01:11:32.289 --> 01:11:35.923
Maybe she was still alive. Maybe
she didn't want to be found.

01:11:37.294 --> 01:11:38.593
He was broken.

01:11:40.563 --> 01:11:43.364
So I said
what he needed to hear.

01:11:44.301 --> 01:11:46.467
I thought I could fix him.

01:11:47.437 --> 01:11:49.337
What happened?

01:11:49.339 --> 01:11:51.072
He broke my arm.

01:11:52.776 --> 01:11:54.909
You have to protect yourself.

01:11:59.949 --> 01:12:02.350
[suspense music]

01:12:06.389 --> 01:12:07.455
You know her?

01:12:10.093 --> 01:12:11.459
Mom, that's Hugo.

01:12:12.862 --> 01:12:14.862
No, I don't think so.

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:20.735
Come on, let's go inside.

01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:34.082
Sir, can you hear me?
You've been in an accident.

01:12:35.952 --> 01:12:39.020
She-- She is here.

01:12:39.022 --> 01:12:41.823
The other driver?
They took her to the hospital.

01:12:41.825 --> 01:12:43.891
[Daniel] I can't-- she's--

01:12:43.893 --> 01:12:46.027
[man]
Sir, I need you to stay with me.

01:12:46.029 --> 01:12:47.995
Can you follow my finger?
Keep your eyes on me.

01:12:47.997 --> 01:12:49.063
Can you do that?

01:12:52.001 --> 01:12:55.403
-[man] Is he drunk?
-I don't think so.

01:12:55.405 --> 01:12:57.105
[suspense music]

01:13:13.423 --> 01:13:14.722
Thanks for the ride.

01:13:55.465 --> 01:13:57.131
[suspense music continues]

01:14:07.010 --> 01:14:09.577
[knocking on door]

01:14:09.579 --> 01:14:10.711
Coming.

01:14:15.185 --> 01:14:16.918
-[sighs]
-Daniel.

01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:18.586
-Oh.
-Is everything okay?

01:14:18.588 --> 01:14:20.188
I had to see you.

01:14:22.459 --> 01:14:23.624
What are you doing here?

01:14:26.930 --> 01:14:30.731
-I got your messages.
-What messages?

01:14:30.733 --> 01:14:31.799
In your art.

01:14:33.169 --> 01:14:34.669
Your painting.

01:14:35.505 --> 01:14:36.938
You've been speaking to me.

01:14:37.774 --> 01:14:40.508
-I don't understand.
-We can be together.

01:14:40.510 --> 01:14:42.743
We can make this work.
I know we can.

01:14:42.745 --> 01:14:45.713
I love you so much, baby.
I'm here now.

01:14:45.715 --> 01:14:47.582
You don't have to go.
You're not going.

01:14:47.584 --> 01:14:49.817
Wait a minute, you're not making
any sense, Daniel.

01:14:49.819 --> 01:14:51.719
-Please, let go of me.
-Baby, I'm here.

01:14:51.721 --> 01:14:53.921
You don't have to worry.
I'm here.

01:14:54.791 --> 01:14:57.158
Look, it's been months.

01:14:58.027 --> 01:14:59.627
You really shouldn't be here.

01:14:59.629 --> 01:15:01.562
I need you to go, okay?

01:15:01.564 --> 01:15:03.197
No more pretending, Maggie.

01:15:04.067 --> 01:15:06.234
I know you need me.

01:15:06.236 --> 01:15:10.137
-I know it now.
-Daniel, you don't sound well.

01:15:10.139 --> 01:15:11.973
I really think
you better leave.

01:15:11.975 --> 01:15:14.075
[suspense music continues]

01:15:15.245 --> 01:15:16.544
Is that it?

01:15:19.682 --> 01:15:21.682
-Daniel.
-It's incredible!

01:15:22.552 --> 01:15:24.852
It-- It's not finished yet.

01:15:25.788 --> 01:15:26.854
I love it.

01:15:27.857 --> 01:15:29.857
I get it. I get it.

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:33.227
Get what?

01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:35.563
I get this.

01:15:35.565 --> 01:15:37.064
I understand you.

01:15:38.701 --> 01:15:42.270
Um, it's late.

01:15:42.272 --> 01:15:44.272
Why don't we just talk
about this tomorrow?

01:15:44.274 --> 01:15:46.974
Maggie, you don't need
to hide anymore.

01:15:46.976 --> 01:15:48.042
It's me.

01:15:48.044 --> 01:15:51.279
Look, I think
you have the wrong idea.

01:15:51.281 --> 01:15:53.681
Stop with the act.
It's just us.

01:15:54.784 --> 01:15:55.917
I know the truth.

01:15:57.086 --> 01:15:58.819
I know you're painting for me.

01:16:00.089 --> 01:16:05.059
Let me be very clear. I have no
idea what you are talking about.

01:16:06.062 --> 01:16:10.565
-[moans]
-Look, I-- I've been
seeing someone else.

01:16:10.567 --> 01:16:12.900
He's on his way over here.
So I really think you better go.

01:16:12.902 --> 01:16:14.835
We don't have to be apart.

01:16:14.837 --> 01:16:17.238
I can help you.
I can support you.

01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:21.776
-I love you, too. I do.
-Daniel! Please.

01:16:21.778 --> 01:16:24.345
Don't you understand
what I'm saying to you?

01:16:24.347 --> 01:16:28.015
Look, this is a mistake.
This is all in your head.

01:16:28.017 --> 01:16:30.017
Sh, don't do that.

01:16:30.954 --> 01:16:35.289
It's okay. It's okay.
Everybody-- everybody makes
mistakes sometimes.

01:16:35.291 --> 01:16:39.327
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.
Shut up. You love me.

01:16:39.329 --> 01:16:41.963
Okay, it's time
for you to go now.

01:16:45.168 --> 01:16:47.335
-No.
-Daniel.

01:16:47.337 --> 01:16:49.170
-No.
-Yes, Daniel, come on.

01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:51.906
No!

01:16:51.908 --> 01:16:55.042
-Daniel.
-No! Why are you lying?

01:16:55.979 --> 01:16:58.245
What are you doing? No!

01:16:58.247 --> 01:17:01.248
No! Stop it!
what are you doing?

01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:04.619
Stop. Stop it. Stop it.

01:17:04.621 --> 01:17:07.989
What are you doing? No.
Why are you doing this?

01:17:07.991 --> 01:17:10.925
Why?
Why are you doing this?

01:17:12.795 --> 01:17:14.862
I'm all you need.

01:17:16.633 --> 01:17:18.699
You told me that
in the painting.

01:17:21.738 --> 01:17:24.005
I don't understand.

01:17:26.743 --> 01:17:29.944
You want me here.

01:17:32.315 --> 01:17:34.915
We are supposed to be together.

01:17:38.855 --> 01:17:40.888
Just go.

01:17:43.026 --> 01:17:44.225
Maggie.

01:17:45.361 --> 01:17:47.828
Get out of here!

01:17:54.771 --> 01:17:58.839
[cries]

01:18:15.725 --> 01:18:17.425
-[man] The other driver?
-[man] They took her in first.

01:18:17.427 --> 01:18:19.360
Should be
in surgery already.

01:18:19.362 --> 01:18:21.429
So what's he still doing here?

01:18:21.431 --> 01:18:24.799
A couple of GSW is downtown.
Emergency is backed up.

01:18:24.801 --> 01:18:27.935
Figures. Look, I'm going
to grab a cup of coffee.

01:18:27.937 --> 01:18:30.871
Let me know when he is awake.
We got lot of questions.

01:18:30.873 --> 01:18:31.972
Poor girl.

01:19:29.298 --> 01:19:31.432

[suspense music continues]

01:21:49.205 --> 01:21:51.105
Hugo, I need to set the table.

01:21:53.676 --> 01:21:56.410
Yes. Hi. Yeah, this is she.

01:21:56.412 --> 01:21:58.412
No, I've been waiting
for an update.

01:22:02.285 --> 01:22:04.451
So he's still in surgery?

01:22:04.453 --> 01:22:05.920
Wait, is that bad?

01:22:09.091 --> 01:22:10.624
Mom, can you turn that down?

01:22:13.629 --> 01:22:16.630
Yeah. Yes. No, I'll be
over there later tonight.

01:22:17.466 --> 01:22:20.134
Okay. Yeah, thank you. Bye.

01:22:22.071 --> 01:22:23.938
[suspense music]

01:23:00.042 --> 01:23:01.141
Hugo.

01:23:01.142 --> 01:23:02.241
[Maggie] So the gallery
called today

01:23:02.244 --> 01:23:05.212
and they want to give me
a solo show.

01:23:05.214 --> 01:23:09.049
I know. I know.
My own solo show.

01:23:09.051 --> 01:23:12.486
-I'm going to have
the gallery for a full month.
-[woman] <i> That's great, honey.</i>

01:23:12.488 --> 01:23:15.322
Now I just have to figure out
which pieces to show.

01:23:15.324 --> 01:23:18.258
<i> When's the opening?</i>
<i> Maybe dad and I can come down.</i>

01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:22.329
Um, it's--
it's the first week of June.
I'd love it if you could come.

01:23:22.331 --> 01:23:25.099
<i> Are you kidding?</i>
<i> We wouldn't miss it.</i>

01:23:25.101 --> 01:23:27.701
<i>-We're so proud of you, Maggie.</i>
-Thanks, Mom.

01:23:27.703 --> 01:23:30.738
You know, I really better run.
Clause wants to introduce me

01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:33.240
to a few local collectors
tonight and I don't want
to be late.

01:23:33.242 --> 01:23:35.709
<i> Let me know how it goes.</i>
<i> You'll do great.</i>

01:23:35.711 --> 01:23:37.444
Thanks. I can call you after.

01:23:37.446 --> 01:23:39.747
<i> -Alright. Bye-bye. I love you.</i>
-Okay.

01:23:39.749 --> 01:23:41.648
Love you, too. Bye.

Yes, yes, help.
There's an accident,

Please help us,
someone's been hurt. Send help.

Come on, Maggie. Come on.
You're okay. You're okay.

Open your eyes.
Babe, you open your eyes.

You're going to be just fine.

Where's the money, Nina?

I told you.
I don't have it.

-What?
-You used her
and left her alone.

Shut up! You don't know
what you're saying.

01:33:10.953 --> 01:33:15.021
Hugo. My sweet baby.

01:33:15.023 --> 01:33:16.957
[crying]

01:33:29.237 --> 01:33:30.537

<i> The parole board has reviewed</i>
<i> the inmate's request</i>

01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:34.841
<i> and found her to be</i>
<i> a model prisoner</i>
<i> during the eighteen months</i>

01:33:34.843 --> 01:33:38.878
<i>she has served for felony theft</i>
<i> by false pretenses.</i>

01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:41.615
<i> In recognition</i>
<i> of this good behavior,</i>

01:33:41.617 --> 01:33:44.784
<i> the inmate is released</i>
<i> on parole for the remainder</i>
<i> of her sentence.</i>

01:33:44.786 --> 01:33:47.654
<i> Congratulations.</i>
<i> You're a free woman.</i>

01:34:23.959 --> 01:34:26.760
-Do you have a five?
-Go fish.

01:34:29.665 --> 01:34:30.897
Do you have a five?

01:34:32.134 --> 01:34:35.301
I am so onto your scam,
old lady.

[Nina]
Don't tell me what it says.

01:35:41.269 --> 01:35:43.403
[slow music]

01:35:49.511 --> 01:35:50.777
Hugo.

01:36:09.030 --> 01:36:10.296
Who's hungry?

01:36:12.067 --> 01:36:14.834
-I am.
-Alright.
