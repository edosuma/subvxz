01:01.626 --> 01:03.193
I gotta open up the shop.

01:03.237 --> 01:05.108
- Kenny,
you're leaving us one short.

01:05.152 --> 01:06.805
- Like y'all ain't gonna
be at the shop later,

01:06.849 --> 01:08.198
begging to fit you in
for a lineup, right?

01:08.242 --> 01:11.288
- Hey, stroller guy,
you want to run?

01:11.332 --> 01:12.333
- Me?

01:12.376 --> 01:15.379
Oh, sorry.
Baby.

01:15.423 --> 01:16.380

01:16.424 --> 01:18.382
- Uh...

01:18.426 --> 01:20.297
No, no, that's okay.
I don't want to...

01:20.341 --> 01:21.385
- I babysit all the time.

01:21.429 --> 01:23.257
You got no reason not to play.

01:23.300 --> 01:25.563

01:47.585 --> 01:49.283

I hope you pass

01:49.326 --> 01:51.589
some serious math skills
onto this baby.

- ♪ What a life, what a goal,

02:02.600 --> 02:05.299

02:24.492 --> 02:25.449
- We'll get that back.

02:26.929 --> 02:29.671
- Sorry, guys,
I got to...duty calls.

02:29.714 --> 02:31.629
- Aww.
- Fun's over.

02:33.675 --> 02:34.893
- You might not be able
to shoot, stroller guy,

02:34.937 --> 02:36.460
but look at Marquis.

02:36.504 --> 02:38.636
You definitely had him
running up and down the court.

02:38.680 --> 02:40.203
- It was fun.

02:40.247 --> 02:41.204
- Yeah, man,
good playing with you, man.

02:41.248 --> 02:42.249
- You, too.

02:43.380 --> 02:44.425
Hey, thanks.

02:46.949 --> 02:48.211
- First time
playing basketball?

02:48.255 --> 02:49.560
- No way.

02:49.604 --> 02:52.433
Two years YMCA rec league.
Basically pro.

02:54.739 --> 02:56.654
Daddy's got mad skills,
right?

02:56.698 --> 02:59.222
Don't listen to them.
- Dad, are you okay?

03:02.573 --> 03:03.531
Dad!
- Rod, grab the stroller.

03:03.574 --> 03:05.489
- Marquis!

03:05.533 --> 03:06.577
- Give me some space.

03:10.364 --> 03:12.192
Call 9-1-1.

03:15.760 --> 03:17.719
- 32-year-old man found down.

03:17.762 --> 03:19.677
No pulse, no respirations.

03:19.721 --> 03:21.331
Cardiac resuscitation
started immediately.

03:21.375 --> 03:22.724
- Get the defibrillator ready.

03:22.767 --> 03:24.421
- He was sweating profusely
as he boxed me out

03:24.465 --> 03:25.944
in our pickup game.
- Your pickup game?

03:25.988 --> 03:27.511
- Why does no on believe
I can play?

03:27.555 --> 03:28.991
- Is he gonna be okay?

03:29.034 --> 03:30.340
- Yeah, just come with me.

03:30.384 --> 03:31.689
- Nuh-uh.
I'm going in with him.

03:31.733 --> 03:33.213
- I need you to stay here.

03:33.256 --> 03:35.389
- Just tell me plain.
Is my dad gonna be okay?

03:35.432 --> 03:37.521
- You watched over my daughter,

03:37.565 --> 03:40.524
and we're gonna
watch over your dad.

03:40.568 --> 03:41.743
Okay?

03:45.747 --> 03:48.706
- First, I divide the pleura
to isolate the diaphragm.

03:48.750 --> 03:51.535
Then, with forceps
applying gentle traction,

03:51.579 --> 03:54.016
I plicate the paralyzed area
using a series of U-sutures.

03:54.059 --> 03:55.322
- Where are those anchored?

03:55.365 --> 03:57.324
- Costal arch of the sixth rib.

03:57.367 --> 03:58.629
I also dug deep and found

03:58.673 --> 04:01.284
a completely
endoscopic approach.

04:01.328 --> 04:03.547
- No partial thoracotomy?

04:03.591 --> 04:05.549
Since when?
That's not how I trained.

04:05.593 --> 04:07.290
- You got some reading to do.

04:08.596 --> 04:10.598
- Damn, Duke,
you're putting me on the ropes.

04:14.384 --> 04:16.995
- I'm just, I'm so mad
at myself right now.

04:17.039 --> 04:18.606
- So much
for telling you my news.

04:18.649 --> 04:21.348
- We have four children
under 10 already.

04:21.391 --> 04:22.566
But, no,
I have to suggest to Martin

04:22.610 --> 04:24.568
that we adopt another one.
Why?

04:24.612 --> 04:27.571
What am I doing?
Why do I always do this?

04:27.615 --> 04:29.617
But it's like if you see
a squirrel in the park

04:29.660 --> 04:31.575
and it's injured, or, like,
a pigeon with a bum wing

04:31.619 --> 04:32.576
or whatever,
do you not try to rescue it?

04:32.620 --> 04:34.012
- No.

04:34.056 --> 04:35.449
- You don't?
I do.

04:35.492 --> 04:38.278
That's, like, my go-to.
I just can't help myself.

04:38.321 --> 04:40.367
But Martin, you know,
you should've seen the look

04:40.410 --> 04:42.586
on his face this morning,
Vijay, it was like...

04:42.630 --> 04:44.414
I don't know.
What's a word that means angry

04:44.458 --> 04:46.329
but also profoundly
exasperated?

04:46.373 --> 04:47.591
- English is not my first
language, but--

04:47.635 --> 04:50.333
- I see these kids
in the refugee camps,

04:50.377 --> 04:51.465
and I see the looks
on their faces,

04:51.508 --> 04:53.336
and it's a no-brainer for me.

04:53.380 --> 04:56.774
We have money, we have space,
we--Martin--ugh, Martin.

04:56.818 --> 04:58.341
No, Martin's right.
Martin's right.

04:58.385 --> 05:00.343
Martin is always right.

05:00.387 --> 05:01.649
We have a full family as is,

05:01.692 --> 05:02.650
and there are tons
of other ways to help.

05:02.693 --> 05:04.434
Thank you.

05:04.478 --> 05:06.044
Thank you for talking
me through this, Vijay.

05:06.088 --> 05:08.569
I appreciate it.
Now hit me with the good news.

05:08.612 --> 05:09.744
What's going on?

05:09.787 --> 05:11.746
- We are having a baby.

05:13.400 --> 05:14.792
- What?

05:14.836 --> 05:17.099
Are you seeing someone?

05:17.142 --> 05:19.580
- Not me, but Ella,
she's carrying my grandchild.

05:19.623 --> 05:21.799
Can you believe it?

05:21.843 --> 05:22.800
- No, not even a little bit.

05:22.844 --> 05:24.541
- At first, it was all bad,

05:24.585 --> 05:27.457
but what choice do I have
but to take it as a blessing?

05:27.501 --> 05:29.720
I can't stop smiling.

05:34.725 --> 05:36.640
Are you okay?

05:36.684 --> 05:38.512
- We're having a baby.

05:38.555 --> 05:40.427
We're having a baby!

05:49.827 --> 05:51.438
- Maybe you're not
stretching it enough.

05:51.481 --> 05:53.396
- You know what?
I never thought of that.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.833
- Really?
- No, not really.

05:55.877 --> 05:58.488
I am doing all
of the recommended stretches

05:58.532 --> 06:00.664
and exercises,
and you know what?

06:00.708 --> 06:02.405
Sometimes things just hurt.

06:02.449 --> 06:04.842
- On a scale of one to ten,
how's your pain level?

06:04.886 --> 06:05.887
- A hard one.

06:05.930 --> 06:07.105
- Sounds more like...

06:07.149 --> 06:08.542
- Oh, you got me.

06:08.585 --> 06:11.109
Yeah, my pain level
is jazz hands.

06:11.153 --> 06:12.850
You know what?
even if you are right,

06:12.894 --> 06:15.853
and I am in otherworldly pain,

06:15.897 --> 06:18.508
I've got physical therapy
right after work.

06:18.552 --> 06:20.510
- That's in nine hours.
Why don't you see if Ligon

06:20.554 --> 06:22.120
can squeeze you in
for a quick session?

06:22.164 --> 06:23.426
Just so you can
get through the day.

06:23.470 --> 06:24.514
Hm?

06:39.921 --> 06:41.444
- What's wrong?

06:41.488 --> 06:43.185
- This time,
I should be on top.

06:45.709 --> 06:48.538
- I, of course, say that
from a therapeutic standpoint.

06:50.975 --> 06:52.412
- Ms. Richards.

06:52.455 --> 06:53.717
Welcome to New Amsterdam.

06:53.761 --> 06:55.719
- Thrilled to be here.

06:55.763 --> 06:58.505
- Yeah, so I understand
that you were previously

06:58.548 --> 07:00.724
at Mount Zion under Dr. Castro.

07:00.768 --> 07:03.205
- Yes.
I'm embarrassed to ask you,

07:03.248 --> 07:06.730
but would mind?

07:06.774 --> 07:10.168
Could you just write,
"Warm regards, Molly?"

07:10.212 --> 07:11.866
- Of course.

07:11.909 --> 07:13.955
- It's an old co-worker.

07:13.998 --> 07:17.915
We recently
lost a mutual friend.

07:17.959 --> 07:19.787
I can't grip the--ow.

07:19.830 --> 07:21.832
- It's not a problem.
There you go.

07:21.876 --> 07:23.443
- Thank you, dear.

07:23.486 --> 07:25.749
- I'm Dr. Sharpe.
I run the oncology--

07:25.793 --> 07:30.450
Dr. Castro and I
head the department.

07:30.493 --> 07:33.714
- I'm glad to see women
are running things here, too.

07:33.757 --> 07:37.587
I was a partner
at Goldman and Fitch.

07:37.631 --> 07:40.198
- Investment banking
Impressive.

07:40.242 --> 07:41.765
I have a number
of patients in that field.

07:41.809 --> 07:43.767
Almost all are men.

07:43.811 --> 07:48.250
- We gals, as they called us,
were about one in ten.

07:48.293 --> 07:50.861
It was great fun,
before I was sidelined

07:50.905 --> 07:52.559
by this stupid disease.

07:52.602 --> 07:54.691
- I can see
you're in a lot of pain.

07:54.735 --> 07:56.780
- Dr. Castro warned me
this latest

07:56.824 --> 08:01.002
experimental agent
might be rough.

08:01.045 --> 08:03.961
- How many have you tried?

08:04.005 --> 08:05.920
- I don't know.
Seven.

08:10.011 --> 08:11.621
- How you feeling?

08:11.665 --> 08:13.536
I was gonna make
a Floyd Mayweather reference,

08:13.580 --> 08:14.972
but I don't think
sports is your thing.

08:15.016 --> 08:16.670
- He was a boxer.

08:16.713 --> 08:18.759
- Oh, was he?
Thank you for that.

08:18.802 --> 08:21.979
Uh, Marquis, you have a heart
that's been working overtime.

08:22.023 --> 08:23.807
Do you know
you have hypertension?

08:23.851 --> 08:24.808
- Of course
my blood pressure's up.

08:24.852 --> 08:26.549
I'm in the damn hospital.

08:26.593 --> 08:28.246
You get me outside,
it's a different story.

08:28.290 --> 08:29.683
- Well,
it's high blood pressure

08:29.726 --> 08:30.684
that brought you in here.

08:30.727 --> 08:31.989
- That's impossible.

08:32.033 --> 08:33.991
I exercise every day.
I eat healthy.

08:34.035 --> 08:35.863
- Your condition's been
developing for some time.

08:35.906 --> 08:38.039
When's the last time you that
had a checkup or a physical?

08:38.082 --> 08:39.736
- Not since I've been alive.

08:39.780 --> 08:42.652
- Why go to the doctor
when you're healthy?

08:42.696 --> 08:44.785
- Best time to go to the doctor
is before you get sick.

08:44.828 --> 08:46.526
Blood sugar checks,
cancer screenings--

08:46.569 --> 08:48.702
- And the added benefit
of missing work?

08:50.617 --> 08:52.009
- How many guys I met today

08:52.053 --> 08:53.794
have the same policy
on doctors?

08:55.056 --> 08:56.057
- All of them.

09:07.329 --> 09:08.286
- Hi, there.

09:08.330 --> 09:09.766
- Stroller guy.

09:09.810 --> 09:12.856
- Yeah.
Also known as Dr. Max Goodwin.

09:12.900 --> 09:14.031
- Dr. G.

09:14.075 --> 09:15.293
- That's cooler.
Let's go with that.

09:15.337 --> 09:16.904
- Kenny.

09:16.947 --> 09:17.905
Thanks for helping
my boy Quis out.

09:17.948 --> 09:18.906
- Sure.

09:18.949 --> 09:20.603
- How's he doing?

09:20.647 --> 09:23.301
- It's tough to say,
but just glad I was there.

09:23.345 --> 09:25.303
- Marquis is one
of my best customers.

09:25.347 --> 09:27.044
How about I give you
a trim free of charge?

09:27.088 --> 09:28.742
- You know what?
I actually...

09:28.785 --> 09:31.048
I have a free service for you.

09:31.092 --> 09:32.659
- What kind of service?

09:34.704 --> 09:35.836
- What do you think
about Kenny's Kuts

09:35.879 --> 09:38.099
having its own
in-house physician?

09:44.279 --> 09:45.889
- So you want to set up
in my shop?

09:45.933 --> 09:47.499
- Uh, yeah.

09:47.543 --> 09:48.631
I want to give consultations
to your customers,

09:48.675 --> 09:50.328
free of charge.

09:50.372 --> 09:52.287
- Yeah, but, like, here?
Like, inside the shop?

09:52.330 --> 09:53.331
- Right here.

09:53.375 --> 09:54.637
- Look, Doc, the only cutting

09:54.681 --> 09:57.640
that goes on inside
this clinic is hair.

09:57.684 --> 09:59.468
- Look, Marquis
is your customer, right?

09:59.511 --> 10:02.645
He just had a cardiac emergency
due to unchecked hypertension.

10:02.689 --> 10:05.430
But what if he had a doctor
checking his blood pressure

10:05.474 --> 10:07.868
every so often, say,
every time he gets a haircut?

10:07.911 --> 10:09.173
- I feel you,
but what makes you think

10:09.217 --> 10:10.566
all of my customers need help?

10:10.610 --> 10:13.134
- Three in four African
American men develop

10:13.177 --> 10:14.875
high blood pressure
by the age of 55,

10:14.918 --> 10:20.315
and are twice as likely
to die from cardiac disease.

10:20.358 --> 10:22.665
- I don't know, man.
Not buying it.

10:22.709 --> 10:25.276
- Look, it's not gonna
cost you a thing, all right?

10:25.320 --> 10:26.669
Once a week,
I'll spend an hour in the back,

10:26.713 --> 10:28.410
and if anybody wants

10:28.453 --> 10:30.325
to get their blood pressure
checked, I'm here.

10:30.368 --> 10:32.457
And if it's high,
I give them a pill.

10:32.501 --> 10:34.198
- What you think, man?

10:34.242 --> 10:35.504
- I don't know.

10:35.547 --> 10:39.160
White guy in the back,
handing out pills?

10:39.203 --> 10:40.683
That doesn't look too good.

10:42.729 --> 10:44.382
- What's in it for you?

10:44.426 --> 10:46.515
- I won't have to watch
another 14-year-old girl

10:46.558 --> 10:48.299
think her dad just died.

10:48.343 --> 10:49.692
- ♪ By standing on the wall

10:49.736 --> 10:51.389
♪ Get your back
up off the wall ♪

10:51.433 --> 10:53.174
♪ 'Cause I heard
all the people saying ♪

10:53.217 --> 10:55.393
- Okay.

10:55.437 --> 10:56.917
Mrs. Martone?

10:56.960 --> 10:58.527
- Tessa.

10:58.570 --> 10:59.920
And this is Xander.

10:59.963 --> 11:01.225
- Hey, Xander.

11:01.269 --> 11:02.705
My name is Dr. Bloom,

11:02.749 --> 11:04.576
and this here is Casey.

11:04.620 --> 11:06.709
Do you mind if I take
a look at your head?

11:09.277 --> 11:12.672
Ooh. Okay, that is what
us doctors call a doozy,

11:12.715 --> 11:15.675
but it's nothing
a few stitches can't fix.

11:15.718 --> 11:18.590
So how'd this happen?

11:19.504 --> 11:20.723
- He was doing his homework

11:20.767 --> 11:22.725
when he started
to get frustrated.

11:22.769 --> 11:24.945
Next thing I knew...

11:24.988 --> 11:26.947
he was standing and banging
his head against the wall.

11:32.996 --> 11:34.650
- Can we get
Dr. Frome down here?

11:41.613 --> 11:44.573
- So here's the damaged area
of your heart.

11:44.616 --> 11:46.575
Now there are two options.

11:46.618 --> 11:48.751
We can tuck an internal
defibrillator just under skin

11:48.795 --> 11:49.970
to shock the heart back
into normal rhythm

11:50.013 --> 11:51.536
when it goes out of control,

11:51.580 --> 11:54.496
or we can perform surgery
and take out the part

11:54.539 --> 11:55.584
of your heart
that's causing the problem.

11:55.627 --> 11:57.412
- I was fine this morning.

11:57.455 --> 11:59.283
Now you want to cut into me?

11:59.327 --> 12:00.458
Look, I'm a single father

12:00.502 --> 12:02.504
with a daughter
to take care of.

12:02.547 --> 12:05.725
Who's gonna take care of me
after open-heart surgery?

12:05.768 --> 12:07.248
I won't be a burden to her.

12:07.291 --> 12:09.598
- Wait, wait,
hold up, hold up, hold up.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.343
Might be another option.

12:16.561 --> 12:17.649
So you will wear this
all the time.

12:17.693 --> 12:19.434
- Even in the shower?

12:19.477 --> 12:21.784
- While you're sleeping,
eating, exercising, everything.

12:21.828 --> 12:23.438
Now your monitor's gonna
transmit your heart rhythm

12:23.481 --> 12:24.613
back here to the hospital.

12:24.656 --> 12:25.745
If there's any more
troubling rhythms,

12:25.788 --> 12:27.311
the hospital
will know about it,

12:27.355 --> 12:28.399
and we'll be able
to coordinate a response

12:28.443 --> 12:29.661
to the GPS in the device.

12:29.705 --> 12:31.402
- Marquis,
glad you're feeling better.

12:31.446 --> 12:32.882
- Thanks, Dr. Goodwin.
- Yeah, just so you know,

12:32.926 --> 12:34.362
you can get full health care
from me at Kenny's Kuts.

12:34.405 --> 12:35.624
- Wait, what?

12:35.667 --> 12:36.712
- Yeah, I got a chair
in the back.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.670
I'll see you there.

12:38.714 --> 12:41.325
- Why would...

12:43.458 --> 12:46.809
- Valentina,
I've just met Molly Richards.

12:46.853 --> 12:48.419
- Dry as a martini, isn't she?

12:49.116 --> 12:50.639
- She's suffering.

12:50.682 --> 12:52.380
- She's been through a lot,

12:52.423 --> 12:54.034
but she's a trooper.

12:54.077 --> 12:56.819
- She mentioned how she's
on her seventh drug regimen.

12:56.863 --> 12:58.647
- She's gone through all kinds
of medications

12:58.690 --> 13:00.388
that haven't even
hit the market yet,

13:00.431 --> 13:01.606
even phase one trials.

13:02.564 --> 13:03.826
- So the drugs
you're giving her

13:03.870 --> 13:05.828
are only to see if people
can tolerate them?

13:05.872 --> 13:07.047
- That sounds like a judgment.

13:07.090 --> 13:08.526
- If she's suffering this badly

13:08.570 --> 13:10.093
and you don't even
know if they work--

13:10.137 --> 13:12.487
- Molly's been breaking
barriers her entire life,

13:12.530 --> 13:14.750
so even now,
with incurable cancer,

13:14.794 --> 13:17.579
she gains satisfaction
from pioneering new treatments.

13:17.622 --> 13:19.059
Gives her meaning
to her struggle.

13:19.102 --> 13:23.063
- Mm. And it advances
your career.

13:23.106 --> 13:24.542
- Excuse me?

13:24.586 --> 13:26.936
- Are these treatments
helping her, or you?

13:28.895 --> 13:31.636
- Helen...

13:31.680 --> 13:33.551
she's my patient.

13:39.557 --> 13:41.081
- Hello. Hi.

13:41.124 --> 13:43.605
Hi, Xander.
My name is Dr. Frome.

13:43.648 --> 13:47.522
I heard that you did a real
number on your noggin there.

13:47.565 --> 13:49.089
Ouch.

13:49.132 --> 13:51.787
You think you can talk
to me about why you did it?

13:56.400 --> 13:58.359
- It's okay, sweetie.
Dr. Frome is here to help.

13:58.402 --> 13:59.751
- Absolutely.

14:03.799 --> 14:04.844
- I don't know.

14:07.585 --> 14:10.806
- No?
That's okay.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.677
Why don't you tell me
what happened?

14:19.467 --> 14:21.730
- I don't know.
I just...

14:21.773 --> 14:24.776
I just got mad,
and then I was, like...

14:26.604 --> 14:28.911
Hurting myself.

14:28.955 --> 14:31.609
- Well, that must've
been scary.

14:31.653 --> 14:33.568
Have you gotten mad
like that before?

14:35.962 --> 14:38.790
- I've been frustrated before,
like, with school.

14:38.834 --> 14:39.879
- Yeah.

14:39.922 --> 14:41.793
- My mom.

14:43.970 --> 14:46.668
But never this bad.

14:46.711 --> 14:48.583
- That's okay.

14:50.498 --> 14:51.891
It's okay, Xander.

14:55.590 --> 14:59.159
- It's like...

14:59.202 --> 15:01.726
I'm mad all the time.

15:01.770 --> 15:03.641
And I can't control it anymore.

15:05.817 --> 15:07.776
- I bet that's hard.

15:14.652 --> 15:16.437
- Xander, has your hand
been shaking like that

15:16.480 --> 15:17.960
since you hurt your head?

15:18.004 --> 15:19.701
- It's been like that
for a while.

15:26.969 --> 15:30.625
- You two take it easy here.
I'll be back in a bit, okay?

15:30.668 --> 15:32.627
All right.

15:36.892 --> 15:39.547
Xander Martone
has neurological damage.

15:39.590 --> 15:40.765
- From his head injury?

15:40.809 --> 15:43.943
- No, worse.
From before the head injury.

15:43.986 --> 15:45.727
- Okay, I'll run some tests,
and I'll page Kapoor.

15:45.770 --> 15:46.815
- Okay.

15:50.253 --> 15:51.602
- Code.

15:51.646 --> 15:52.908
- V-fib,
outpatient heart monitor,

15:52.952 --> 15:54.518
Marquis Cannon.
- Damnit.

15:54.562 --> 15:56.694
Okay.

15:56.738 --> 15:58.696
Let me through.
Make room.

16:00.263 --> 16:01.612
- He just stopped and fell.

16:23.721 --> 16:26.028
- Hey, Kenny,
- Hm.

16:26.072 --> 16:28.204
- What's up with Nurse Jackie
down there?

16:28.248 --> 16:30.032
- That's Dr. G,
here on his lunch break.

16:30.076 --> 16:32.078
- So, what, you line me up,
and then Doogie Howser

16:32.121 --> 16:34.428
down there amputates
my leg or something?

16:34.471 --> 16:37.039
What, take out my appendix?
- You know what, man?

16:37.083 --> 16:39.433
I think barbers
actually used to do surgeries.

16:39.476 --> 16:41.087
- He's here for folks like
you who ain't been to a doctor

16:41.130 --> 16:42.740
in a month of Sundays.

16:42.784 --> 16:44.699
- Man, do I look like
I need to go to the doctor?

16:44.742 --> 16:46.222
Hey, maybe I do.

16:46.266 --> 16:48.268
I mean, these pythons
is a little sick, you know?

16:50.052 --> 16:52.272
- What about that time
you busted your elbow

16:52.315 --> 16:53.316
falling off your bike?

16:53.360 --> 16:54.752
- Man, I wrapped it myself.

16:54.796 --> 16:56.276
Let's check it out.
My elbow fine.

16:56.319 --> 16:58.278
- Yo, anybody who's seen
your jumpshot

16:58.321 --> 17:00.149
knows that's not true.

17:00.193 --> 17:02.978
- Okay, okay, okay,
you got jokes.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.284
Man, shut up, man.

17:04.327 --> 17:06.068
It ain't like
you ever been to the doctor.

17:06.112 --> 17:08.288
- Don't trust 'em.
Never have, never will.

17:08.331 --> 17:10.725
- Look, guys,
I know it's a little unusual,

17:10.768 --> 17:13.249
but I'm just...
I'm just trying to help.

17:13.293 --> 17:15.208
- Doc, man,
do yourself a favor,

17:15.251 --> 17:16.731
and go find you
some real sick patients,

17:16.774 --> 17:18.254
like at a retirement home, huh?

17:20.126 --> 17:22.737
- Actually, that's exactly
what I'm trying to do.

17:22.780 --> 17:24.173
- Doc,
you ain't getting it, man.

17:24.217 --> 17:26.132
Ain't none of us sick.

17:26.175 --> 17:27.133
- Um...

17:27.176 --> 17:29.048
it's just that...

17:29.091 --> 17:32.181
untreated malignant
hypertension can kill you,

17:32.225 --> 17:33.443
and as African American men,

17:33.487 --> 17:35.489
you're twice
as likely to have it.

17:35.532 --> 17:37.360
And, Damian, I mean,
how do you know you don't have

17:37.404 --> 17:39.145
a small hole
in your heart right now?

17:39.188 --> 17:40.494
You know, I mean,
you could be sitting here,

17:40.537 --> 17:42.148
chatting with your friends
one minute,

17:42.191 --> 17:43.758
and then the next,
you've thrown a clot,

17:43.801 --> 17:45.803
and you're having a stroke,
you know?

17:45.847 --> 17:48.284
Or, you, you could have
untreated type 2 diabetes,

17:48.328 --> 17:51.548
in which case, I really would
have to amputate that foot.

17:54.116 --> 17:55.770
- Aren't y'all supposed to have
bedside manner, or something?

17:55.813 --> 17:57.772
- Yeah, I know--I didn't
mean to kill the vibe in there.

17:57.815 --> 17:59.382
I just got carried away,
and I--

17:59.426 --> 18:01.471
- My customers don't come here
to be threatened or shamed.

18:01.515 --> 18:03.082
Okay,
especially by some stranger.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.387
- I get it.
It won't happen again.

18:04.431 --> 18:06.650
- Yeah, no kidding,
'cause you're not coming back.

18:08.130 --> 18:10.176
- Fired in the first hour.
That's a new record.

18:17.531 --> 18:21.361
- Okay, so something's
not working in my heart.

18:21.404 --> 18:23.102
That's clear.

18:23.145 --> 18:25.147
What' this thing
about the pacemaker?

18:25.191 --> 18:26.366
That's the one
that doesn't involve you

18:26.409 --> 18:28.324
cracking open my chest, right?

18:28.368 --> 18:30.283
- Right,
but to be perfectly honest,

18:30.326 --> 18:31.588
that option won't be curative.

18:31.632 --> 18:34.156
- I want the pacemaker.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.071
I don't want surgery.
- Weak.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.073
There's a doctor telling you
to your face

18:38.117 --> 18:39.379
there's a good
option and a weak option,

18:39.422 --> 18:41.337
and you're going
for the weak option,

18:41.381 --> 18:42.556
'cause he just said
the pacemaker is like

18:42.599 --> 18:44.601
the midrange jumper
of medicine.

18:44.645 --> 18:46.255
So do me a favor, Dad.

18:46.299 --> 18:48.170
Finish at the rim,
or jack up a three.

18:48.214 --> 18:50.085
Go for the cure or go home,
'cause I don't even want you

18:50.129 --> 18:52.131
in my house
if you're not gonna play right.

18:57.875 --> 19:00.139
- Looks like
I'm getting the surgery.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.234
- Okay, let's start him
on Phenytoin.

19:08.277 --> 19:10.584
850mg IV loading dose.

19:10.627 --> 19:12.629
- Excuse me,
have you seen Dr. Bloom?

19:14.327 --> 19:16.372
- Oh, you are not serious.

19:16.416 --> 19:17.373
- Oh, there you are.

19:17.417 --> 19:19.158
- Yes.

19:19.201 --> 19:21.595
Here I am on the floor
I am supposed to be on.

19:21.638 --> 19:22.596
Come with me.

19:30.647 --> 19:33.868
Okay.
I know what's going on here.

19:33.911 --> 19:35.261
- You do?

19:35.304 --> 19:38.220
- Yes, I came to see you
twice yesterday.

19:38.264 --> 19:39.352
I was desperate and hurting

19:39.395 --> 19:40.396
and I was having
a good-hair day,

19:40.440 --> 19:41.876
and you thought maybe this

19:41.919 --> 19:43.269
would turn into
the kind of arrangement

19:43.312 --> 19:44.444
where you could just
pop down here

19:44.487 --> 19:46.141
any time
you had an itch to scratch

19:46.185 --> 19:47.447
and I would service you
in between patients.

19:47.490 --> 19:48.839
- That's not--

19:48.883 --> 19:51.320
- But this...hey, this is not
about sex for me.

19:51.364 --> 19:52.887
This is about
managing my pain,

19:52.930 --> 19:56.456
and I come to you,
not the other way around.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.289
- I need your help.

20:03.985 --> 20:05.247
- How can I help?

20:05.291 --> 20:07.206
- That's very good.
Um...

20:07.249 --> 20:10.470
my first day at the barber shop
was not exactly a success.

20:10.513 --> 20:11.906
I got fired.

20:11.949 --> 20:13.908
- Yep.
Saw that coming a mile away.

20:13.951 --> 20:16.345
- Did you?
Thanks for saying something.

20:16.389 --> 20:18.913
I was thinking maybe
you could give it a shot.

20:18.956 --> 20:20.523
- What makes you think
I can do any better?

20:20.567 --> 20:24.266
- Well, it's just,
you know, I think my particular

20:24.310 --> 20:27.313
complexion puts me at a slight
disadvantage, shall we say,

20:27.356 --> 20:31.404
that maybe you won't encounter
for various reasons.

20:31.447 --> 20:32.666
- It's 'cause I'm black.

20:32.709 --> 20:34.276
- It's because
you're black, yeah.

20:34.320 --> 20:35.930
- Right, and you want me
to bail you out

20:35.973 --> 20:38.237
with a group of people
who don't trust you.

20:38.280 --> 20:39.368
- If you wouldn't mind.

20:39.412 --> 20:41.675
- Except the problem isn't you.

20:41.718 --> 20:44.199
I mean, well, it's always just
a little bit of you, but...

20:44.243 --> 20:46.375
it's things like the Tuskegee
Syphilis Experiment.

20:46.419 --> 20:48.986
Henrietta Lacks, experimental
surgeries on slaves.

20:49.030 --> 20:50.597
Those kind of things
are the things that cause

20:50.640 --> 20:52.512
black people to take pause

20:52.555 --> 20:55.645
whenever a doctor like yourself
comes around asking to help.

20:57.343 --> 20:58.648
- Yeah.

20:58.692 --> 21:00.694
What are you telling me,
not to help?

21:00.737 --> 21:01.695
- I'm telling you
that it doesn't matter

21:01.738 --> 21:03.349
who you send in there.

21:03.392 --> 21:05.481
They're not a part
of their community,

21:05.525 --> 21:06.700
they're gonna be
met with a block.

21:06.743 --> 21:07.788
- Right.

21:09.572 --> 21:10.530
Right.

21:10.573 --> 21:11.966
- Max, I know that face.

21:12.009 --> 21:13.315
Whatever you're thinking,
don't.

21:13.359 --> 21:14.360
- Thank you.

21:31.420 --> 21:32.726
- Dr. Sharpe.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.425
- Bearing gifts.

21:36.469 --> 21:38.340
- If you're really
the head of the department,

21:38.384 --> 21:41.387
surely you have people
to do that for you.

21:41.430 --> 21:42.736
- Co-head.

21:42.779 --> 21:45.565
And I like seeing patients.

21:46.827 --> 21:48.568
Make sure they're being
taken care of properly.

21:48.611 --> 21:50.439
- Control freak, huh?

21:51.614 --> 21:53.399
Me, too.

21:57.794 --> 21:59.579
- Molly...

21:59.622 --> 22:01.320
do you mind
if I call you Molly?

22:01.363 --> 22:03.060
- No.

22:03.104 --> 22:06.368
- How did you lose your friend?
From the letter.

22:06.412 --> 22:08.327
- Stupid accident.

22:09.632 --> 22:12.679
I confess.
Part of me envies her.

22:15.508 --> 22:18.380
Life, fine.

22:18.424 --> 22:20.600
Death, at this point...

22:20.643 --> 22:22.384
fine, too.

22:24.691 --> 22:26.780
- It's the middle ground,
waiting for death,

22:26.823 --> 22:28.825
that's...

22:28.869 --> 22:30.436
humiliating.

22:35.528 --> 22:37.834
- So why are you continuing
with the treatments?

22:39.575 --> 22:43.057
- Dr. Castro said my tumor
is a good one for study.

22:43.100 --> 22:46.756
Some genetic variant makes
it deliciously interesting.

22:46.800 --> 22:49.629
- So you like being
part of the process.

22:49.672 --> 22:51.370
You find it satisfying.

22:53.372 --> 22:54.373
- I used to.

23:00.422 --> 23:01.510
- Molly.

23:03.556 --> 23:07.516
Has Dr. Castro ever
talked to you about hospice?

23:08.517 --> 23:10.127
- Hospice?

23:10.171 --> 23:13.348
The trial...

23:13.392 --> 23:16.395
someone else is still
pulling the strings.

23:22.923 --> 23:26.970
I miss being in control,
especially now.

23:28.711 --> 23:29.712
At the end.

23:35.631 --> 23:39.896
- Your son's CT is clear.
That's the good news.

23:39.940 --> 23:43.160
But his blood work revealed...

23:43.204 --> 23:45.902
extremely high levels
of lead toxicity.

23:45.946 --> 23:48.601
- Lead?

23:48.644 --> 23:50.429
What does that mean?

23:50.472 --> 23:51.865
- Well, this level
of exposure affected

23:51.908 --> 23:53.475
every one of Xander's organs.

23:53.519 --> 23:55.564
It's the reason
for the impulse control,

23:55.608 --> 23:57.436
the violent emotional swings,
also the hand tremors.

23:57.479 --> 23:58.480
All of it.

23:58.524 --> 23:59.481
- But we caught it early.

23:59.525 --> 24:00.700
We'll get him started

24:00.743 --> 24:01.875
with the chelation
therapy right away.

24:01.918 --> 24:02.876
- Absolutely.

24:02.919 --> 24:04.573
- How was he exposed?

24:04.617 --> 24:06.619
- Most likely in your home.

24:06.662 --> 24:08.708
- But I have notified the city
to come out and test your home.

24:08.751 --> 24:12.625
Unfortunately, full disclosure,
they are a little backed up.

24:12.668 --> 24:15.018
It could be a few months.

24:16.542 --> 24:17.717
- So I'm supposed to go
back home and just

24:17.760 --> 24:18.892
hope that it's safe?

24:18.935 --> 24:20.676
- No.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.199
For Xander's sake,
you can't take him

24:22.243 --> 24:24.201
back until it's cleared.

24:29.250 --> 24:31.905
- Where am I supposed to go?

24:31.948 --> 24:33.950
I don't have anywhere else.

24:36.518 --> 24:38.520
- Perhaps we could help.

24:57.670 --> 24:59.193
No lead.

24:59.236 --> 25:00.455
Has your turned red anywhere?

25:00.499 --> 25:01.761
- Nope.

25:01.804 --> 25:04.590
So we will have to test
Xander's school

25:04.633 --> 25:06.766
and all of the parks
that he likes to play in.

25:06.809 --> 25:07.984
And by we,
obviously I mean the city

25:08.028 --> 25:10.987
whose job this actually is.

25:12.685 --> 25:14.643
- Yeah, you good right there.

25:16.645 --> 25:19.213
- Let me see
one of those swabs.

25:19.256 --> 25:21.520
- Uh, okay.

25:26.002 --> 25:28.004
- Look. Lead.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.791
- What are you,
some sort of lead magician?

25:31.834 --> 25:33.488
How did you know that?

25:33.532 --> 25:35.577
- That overpass
has been repainted.

25:35.621 --> 25:37.579
They would've had to scrape
off all the older

25:37.623 --> 25:39.276
layers of the lead paint.

25:39.320 --> 25:40.539
- Oh, yeah.

25:41.888 --> 25:45.587
So if Xander's house
had exposure to lead,

25:45.631 --> 25:47.241
then so will
all of his neighbors.

25:47.284 --> 25:49.635
- And their neighbors.

25:51.898 --> 25:53.639
- The city poisoned
this whole neighborhood.

26:04.301 --> 26:06.608
- Still got time for that cut?

26:06.652 --> 26:07.653
- Hey, yo, doc,
I thought I made

26:07.696 --> 26:08.915
myself clear this morning.

26:08.958 --> 26:10.699
- Yeah, no, you were.
It's just a cut.

26:10.743 --> 26:12.614
- Nah, man.

26:12.658 --> 26:14.442
I had to spend the rest
of the day taking shots

26:14.485 --> 26:15.922
from everybody 'cause of you.

26:17.880 --> 26:19.795
- Sorry. I tend to have
that effect on people.

26:19.839 --> 26:22.885
- You know how hard I worked
to gain those people's trust?

26:22.929 --> 26:25.409
Hm? Make them feel safe?

26:25.453 --> 26:29.152
Everybody who comes to my shop
has something to worry about.

26:29.196 --> 26:31.851
Their jobs, their family...

26:31.894 --> 26:33.722
and, yeah, their health
probably should be

26:33.766 --> 26:37.204
on that list, but people have
a hard enough time as it is.

26:37.247 --> 26:39.815
- What if there's a way
to keep them safe...

26:39.859 --> 26:42.035
and healthy?

26:43.993 --> 26:45.647
- You didn't come here
for a cut, did you?

26:45.691 --> 26:48.955
- Not really, no, 'cause
I really that your customers

26:48.998 --> 26:52.698
don't need some doctor from
the hospital down the street.

26:52.741 --> 26:54.874
They need someone
they trust and respect,

26:54.917 --> 26:56.440
someone they know has
their best interest at heart.

26:56.484 --> 26:57.441
They need you.

26:57.485 --> 26:58.747
- They already got me.

26:58.791 --> 27:01.010
- Well, I'm thinking bigger,
Kenny.

27:01.054 --> 27:02.446
I'm thinking
you could be the one

27:02.490 --> 27:03.926
keeping your community healthy.

27:08.191 --> 27:09.845
- So, what,
you want to make me a doctor?

27:13.893 --> 27:17.113
- Look, how about you give me
that free cut...

27:17.157 --> 27:19.202
and we can talk?

27:23.250 --> 27:25.861
If I don't like your plan,
I'm charging full price.

27:25.905 --> 27:26.949
- Deal.

27:27.820 --> 27:32.041
- The defect is sub-aortal.

27:35.088 --> 27:36.219
- Blood pressure.

27:36.263 --> 27:38.787
- Maintain monitoring.

27:38.831 --> 27:40.789
All right, suction.

27:42.008 --> 27:43.749
Duke, what do you see?

27:45.794 --> 27:46.926
- The left ventricle's dilated.

27:46.969 --> 27:48.275
- That's right.

27:48.318 --> 27:50.016
The heart wall's much thinner
than I expected.

27:50.059 --> 27:52.148
I'm gonna have to go
slow and careful.

27:52.192 --> 27:54.020
Tell the scheduling nurse
we'll need more than two hours.

27:54.063 --> 27:55.282
How long will you need?

27:55.325 --> 27:58.024
- Uh...six hours or more,
and page Max.

27:58.067 --> 27:59.242
All right,
let's go ahead and start

27:59.286 --> 28:01.244
the endoventricular
circular plasty.

28:01.288 --> 28:03.246
- You sure about that?

28:04.291 --> 28:06.772
Why not do
the McCarthy technique?

28:11.951 --> 28:15.824
- We'll do exactly as I said.

28:15.868 --> 28:16.912
Is that clear?

28:19.567 --> 28:21.264
Suction.

28:21.308 --> 28:22.962
- Thank you for coming down,
Mr. Laettner.

28:23.005 --> 28:24.833
- Oh, Nathan.
Nathan's fine.

28:24.877 --> 28:26.095
- Good, good, good, you know,
it's not every day we have

28:26.139 --> 28:27.575
the Deputy Comptroller

28:27.618 --> 28:30.099
of the City of New York
in our midst, so.

28:30.143 --> 28:32.275
- We wish to speak with you
about the lead contamination

28:32.319 --> 28:34.016
in the local neighborhood.

28:34.060 --> 28:36.845
- Yes, you see, Nathan,
the Cross Bronx Expressway

28:36.889 --> 28:38.064
was built before 1972.

28:38.107 --> 28:39.587
I don't know
if you're aware of that.

28:39.630 --> 28:41.241
And this is the part
that's just bananas to me.

28:41.284 --> 28:44.287
Back then, the city
only used lead-based paints.

28:44.331 --> 28:45.941
- The city is fully aware
of that fact, Dr. Frome.

28:45.985 --> 28:47.290
- Oh, are they?

28:47.334 --> 28:49.858
- Yeah, my office is actively
engaged in replacing

28:49.902 --> 28:52.948
all lead-based paints on public
works with safer alternatives.

28:52.992 --> 28:54.950
- Yeah, for which the city
is eternally grateful,

28:54.994 --> 28:57.257
but if your workers
had done so properly,

28:57.300 --> 29:00.956
we wouldn't be here treating
them.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.871
- Yeah.

29:02.915 --> 29:04.960
You see, Nathan,
when the city workers

29:05.004 --> 29:06.309
were sandblasting
the lead-based paint

29:06.353 --> 29:08.007
off that overpass,

29:08.050 --> 29:11.793
they must not
have sealed the blast zones.

29:11.837 --> 29:14.622
Toxic airborne particles
managed to pollute

29:14.665 --> 29:16.102
the entire neighborhood,

29:16.145 --> 29:18.582
every yard
over a six-block stretch.

29:18.626 --> 29:20.976
- So it appears your office
has a huge cleanup job

29:21.020 --> 29:23.849
on your hands,
and a temporary housing crisis.

29:23.892 --> 29:25.241
- You're probably
gonna expect to cough up

29:25.285 --> 29:26.982
a pretty hefty settlement
on this one.

29:29.245 --> 29:31.204
- That lead could've come
from anywhere.

29:31.247 --> 29:34.860
Occupational exposure, food,
structures in the neighborhood,

29:34.903 --> 29:36.209
they were all
built before 1972.

29:36.252 --> 29:38.037
The city is not responsible
for this mess.

29:40.387 --> 29:42.824
And you have no proof
that says otherwise.

29:50.876 --> 29:52.225
- He's seizing.

29:53.661 --> 29:55.358
- Push 2mg of ativan.

29:57.665 --> 30:00.450
- Bloom?

30:03.889 --> 30:05.368
- I'm fine.
Get back to the patient.

30:05.412 --> 30:07.196
- Just lean on me.
- No, I said I'm fine.

30:07.240 --> 30:08.197
- Damnit, Lauren,
just lean on me.

30:08.241 --> 30:10.243
- I am fine.

30:17.206 --> 30:19.208
- Lap pad.

30:23.691 --> 30:27.216
- Tissue strength is lower than
expected.

30:27.260 --> 30:28.391
- How is he?

30:28.435 --> 30:30.263
- He's fading, Max.

30:30.306 --> 30:32.221
I'm gonna be honest.
So am I.

30:32.265 --> 30:34.049
- Well, you want me to call
Flores so you can take a break?

30:34.093 --> 30:36.660
- If I can get
a stitch to hold, I'd be done.

30:36.704 --> 30:37.966
- Per the standardized
calculations.

30:38.010 --> 30:40.012
- The sutures
just keep pulling through.

30:40.055 --> 30:42.144
I can't the walls
of his heart together.

30:43.058 --> 30:45.017
- How can I help?
Say the word.

30:47.454 --> 30:49.195
You can prepare his daughter.

30:50.283 --> 30:51.980
In case.

30:52.024 --> 30:53.939
- We'll leave nurses scrubbed
in.

31:02.251 --> 31:03.687
- You wanted to see me?

31:03.731 --> 31:05.951
- Yes.
Thank you, Jules.

31:12.348 --> 31:15.134
Molly, are you depressed?

31:15.177 --> 31:16.962
- Depressed?

31:17.005 --> 31:18.267
No.

31:18.311 --> 31:21.967
I'm a lot of things,
but that's not one of them.

31:24.360 --> 31:28.016
- Do you still find meaning
in your life?

31:29.975 --> 31:31.019
- No.

31:32.499 --> 31:36.372
- And how would you describe
the quality of your life?

31:41.508 --> 31:43.336
- Lacking...

31:43.379 --> 31:44.424
quality.

31:46.469 --> 31:48.515
Why are you asking me this?

32:02.224 --> 32:05.271
- These are extremely
powerful painkillers.

32:07.316 --> 32:09.362
They're very good
at what they do.

32:13.409 --> 32:16.064
But if you take
too many of them,

32:16.108 --> 32:19.285
your breathing will slow...

32:19.328 --> 32:21.287
and you will die.

32:30.557 --> 32:33.560
I'm gonna leave the room now.

32:33.603 --> 32:35.170
If they're gone when I return,

32:35.214 --> 32:37.216
there will be
no questions asked.

32:46.834 --> 32:48.531
This is your choice.

32:50.229 --> 32:51.491
No one else's.

32:53.841 --> 32:55.147
You're in control.

33:31.139 --> 33:33.968
- Harmony, your...

33:34.012 --> 33:35.970
your dad needs
a little more help,

33:36.014 --> 33:38.059
and...

33:38.103 --> 33:40.105
it might be more
than we can give.

33:42.759 --> 33:44.805
Is there someone
I can call for you?

33:47.112 --> 33:49.114
- No one but me and my dad.

33:52.421 --> 33:55.424
- Okay, well, I know that
waiting can be scary so...

33:55.468 --> 33:58.079
if you need someone to talk to,
I'm here.

33:58.123 --> 33:59.167
- I'm fine.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.042
- Okay, well...

34:05.130 --> 34:07.175
I'm just gonna sit here, too.

34:08.872 --> 34:10.048
If that's okay.

34:27.152 --> 34:29.937
- I want to know exactly what
you said to Molly Richards.

34:29.980 --> 34:32.157
- Why? Has something happened?

34:32.200 --> 34:34.028
- She checked out
of the hospital

34:34.072 --> 34:38.685
after 16 months of working
tirelessly on her behalf.

34:38.728 --> 34:40.861
- Where did she go?

34:40.904 --> 34:43.037
- What did you say
to my patient?

34:43.081 --> 34:46.040
- Okay, first of all,
Valentina,

34:46.084 --> 34:48.042
she's not your patient.

34:48.086 --> 34:49.913
She is our patient.

34:49.957 --> 34:52.046
There are no sides
in this department.

34:52.090 --> 34:53.874
But yes, I did speak with her.

34:53.917 --> 34:55.180
- Of course, you did.

34:55.223 --> 34:57.051
- And I told her
that I thought you were doing

34:57.095 --> 34:58.792
an extraordinary job,

34:58.835 --> 35:01.011
but if her pain
had become too great,

35:01.055 --> 35:02.796
I knew that you
would understand if she chose

35:02.839 --> 35:05.190
not to continue treatment,
because has a physician,

35:05.233 --> 35:07.192
there is no way
that you would put a drug trial

35:07.235 --> 35:11.848
or scientific discovery ahead
of the needs of your patient.

35:11.892 --> 35:15.243
And I am certain
that she appreciated that.

35:18.551 --> 35:22.250
- Next time one
of our patients has an issue,

35:22.294 --> 35:25.210
I promise be equally
supportive of you.

35:35.220 --> 35:37.483
- This is my last album.

35:37.526 --> 35:39.746
- Oh, man, is that you?

35:39.789 --> 35:41.095
Look at you,
you little tough guy.

35:41.139 --> 35:42.270
- We're, like, four.

35:42.314 --> 35:43.924
- Well, I don't care
how old you are.

35:43.967 --> 35:45.143
Serving that attitude.

35:45.186 --> 35:47.928
- Anything outside your house?

35:47.971 --> 35:49.495
- Halloween, obviously.

35:49.538 --> 35:52.193
- I love the wings.

35:52.237 --> 35:54.282
- Oh, my God.

35:54.326 --> 35:56.937
I don't even know
what's happening here.

35:56.980 --> 35:59.287
- They just grow up so fast.

35:59.331 --> 36:01.550
- I been through
so many albums.

36:01.594 --> 36:04.031
My battery's dying.

36:04.074 --> 36:05.554
I don't think
I'm gonna find anything.

36:05.598 --> 36:07.252
- May I?

36:08.992 --> 36:11.169
I think you just did.

36:13.171 --> 36:14.172
Dr. Kapoor?

36:16.043 --> 36:19.089
- This looks like proof to me.

36:27.837 --> 36:29.970
- Oh, hey, Andy.

36:30.013 --> 36:30.971
Where's Ligon?

36:31.014 --> 36:33.191
- Dr. Ligon's on vacation.

36:33.234 --> 36:34.888
- Are you serious?

36:34.931 --> 36:38.239
- I thought he went down
to the ED to tell you.

36:38.283 --> 36:39.545
Would you like
to see Dr. Parsons?

36:39.588 --> 36:40.850
She's also a miracle worker.

36:40.894 --> 36:42.243
- No.

36:42.287 --> 36:43.288
Thank you.

36:51.121 --> 36:52.166
- Ella.

36:54.299 --> 36:55.343
Ella.

36:58.346 --> 37:01.349
I can't stop thinking
about the big news.

37:01.393 --> 37:04.091
- Vijay--
- Don't Vijay me.

37:04.134 --> 37:05.353
We are a family now.

37:07.050 --> 37:08.313
- You haven't told anyone,
have you?

37:10.967 --> 37:12.012
- Of course not.

37:13.318 --> 37:15.450
- Okay.
Um...

39:10.348 --> 39:12.262
Everything I do here
is for a reason.

39:12.306 --> 39:14.177
It works for me.

39:14.221 --> 39:16.354
Now out there on the floor is
a loving, peaceful democracy,

39:16.397 --> 39:18.051
but in there,
it's full-blown dictatorship.

39:18.094 --> 39:19.444
You got it?

39:19.487 --> 39:22.011
- Understood.
- I didn't say you can go.

39:30.368 --> 39:32.152
Run down
the McCarthy technique.

39:32.195 --> 39:35.155
Top to bottom.

39:35.198 --> 39:37.026
- Yes, sir.

39:37.070 --> 39:39.202
You start by opening
the LV apex

39:39.246 --> 39:41.466
at least 1.5cm
from the LAD.

39:41.509 --> 39:43.337
Then,
using a purse string suture,

39:43.381 --> 39:46.122
you pull together the damaged
left ventricular wall.

39:46.775 --> 39:48.734
- Hi.
- We need to talk right now.

39:48.777 --> 39:51.084
- I see you heard about
our plan to sue the city

39:51.127 --> 39:52.346
over lead contamination.

39:52.390 --> 39:53.391
- What? No.

39:53.434 --> 39:54.392
What?

39:54.435 --> 39:56.219
- Oh, then, never mind.

39:56.263 --> 39:57.438
- I'm here because I heard
about your little plan

39:57.482 --> 39:59.048
with the barber.

39:59.092 --> 40:00.093
- Oh, yeah.
Pretty cool, right?

40:00.136 --> 40:02.182
- No, no, not cool.
- Not cool?

40:02.225 --> 40:04.227
No, I'm just training
a barber at Kenny's Kuts

40:04.271 --> 40:07.100
to check his customer's
blood pressure.

40:07.143 --> 40:09.102
- That's it?
- Yeah.

40:09.145 --> 40:11.757
Mostly.
Here me out.

40:11.800 --> 40:13.323
Kenny sees people once a week

40:13.367 --> 40:15.413
in a relaxed
and trusted environment.

40:15.456 --> 40:17.371
You couldn't ask for a better
monitoring situation,

40:17.415 --> 40:21.201
and if anyone exceeds
140/90 for over four weeks...

40:21.244 --> 40:24.030
- The barber
is diagnosing hypertension

40:24.073 --> 40:26.249
and dispensing
prescription meds?

40:26.293 --> 40:27.512
- With my oversight.

40:27.555 --> 40:28.513
- What oversight?
You're not there.

40:28.556 --> 40:30.123
You're here.

40:30.166 --> 40:32.081
- Kenny has a detailed
checklist to follow.

40:32.125 --> 40:35.302
- So do Legos, but no one's
life depends on them.

40:35.345 --> 40:37.260
I mean,
what if mistakes are made?

40:37.304 --> 40:40.394
- There's a built-in system
of checks and balances

40:40.438 --> 40:42.309
that I'll be carefully
supervising,

40:42.352 --> 40:43.571
and, sure, there's some risk,

40:43.615 --> 40:45.486
but Kenny and the others
will be saving lives.

40:45.530 --> 40:47.401
Just imagine--
- Wait, wait, stop.

40:47.445 --> 40:49.229
What others?
You said others?

40:49.272 --> 40:51.144
- Yeah. So far I've enlisted
seven barber shops,

40:51.187 --> 40:53.538
and I'm trying for more.

40:53.581 --> 40:56.236
- Max, what you're doing
is decentralizing

40:56.279 --> 40:58.412
and de-professionalizing
healthcare.

40:58.456 --> 40:59.848
- Exactly.

40:59.892 --> 41:01.415
There's no reason
that healthcare

41:01.459 --> 41:03.286
has to be delivered
in a hospital.

41:03.330 --> 41:05.158
In fact, patients are best
served in an environment

41:05.201 --> 41:06.551
where they're made comfortable

41:06.594 --> 41:09.075
by trusted members
of their own community.

41:09.118 --> 41:12.557
Hospitals have to go
meet patients where they live,

41:12.600 --> 41:14.297
not the other way around.

41:14.341 --> 41:16.561
- So in your idealized world,

41:16.604 --> 41:19.346
there are zero patients
at New Amsterdam?

41:19.389 --> 41:20.434
- Ideally.

41:21.609 --> 41:23.306
Yeah.
