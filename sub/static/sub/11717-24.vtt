00:23.926 --> 00:27.524
The King's hair game
was flawless.

00:27.794 --> 00:28.727
I mean, amazing.

00:28.795 --> 00:29.945
Look at that suit.

00:30.013 --> 00:31.280
White shirt, white pants

00:31.347 --> 00:33.482
and a red lei.

00:33.550 --> 00:35.968
Two people on this earth
could pull that off, okay?

00:36.052 --> 00:37.669
I'm the other one,
so you know.

00:40.390 --> 00:42.257
What's up?

00:42.325 --> 00:45.093
Stan's coming home
tomorrow night.

00:47.397 --> 00:50.432
I have to tell him.

00:54.404 --> 00:56.939
Good.

01:08.084 --> 01:09.518
Go ahead, take it.

01:12.722 --> 01:13.655
I don't understand, Chief.
I thought

01:13.723 --> 01:15.090
you wanted
to talk about my uncle.

01:15.157 --> 01:18.493
The situation with your Uncle
Keako is an unfortunate one,

01:18.561 --> 01:21.296
but the way you
handled it, through all

01:21.364 --> 01:24.099
the false accusations
about stealing that money,

01:24.167 --> 01:25.734
showed character.

01:25.802 --> 01:29.137
So now that the case is closed
and your record's clear,

01:29.205 --> 01:31.173
HPD would like to reinstate you.

01:32.742 --> 01:34.009
At the rank of lieutenant.

01:34.077 --> 01:35.677
Lieutenant?

01:35.745 --> 01:38.179
But I was only a detective
at the time I resigned.

01:38.231 --> 01:40.148
Yes, but if you had never left,

01:40.199 --> 01:41.783
you would've been
lieutenant by now.

01:41.851 --> 01:45.387
Think of it as
restitution.

01:49.075 --> 01:52.461
I truly appreciate
the offer, sir,

01:52.528 --> 01:55.731
but we're doing great work
over at Five-O.

01:55.798 --> 01:58.333
That's my home now.

02:03.039 --> 02:04.890
How's it, Duke?

02:04.974 --> 02:06.508
How's it, Chin?

02:07.393 --> 02:08.710
What you got there?

02:08.761 --> 02:10.479
Oh.

02:10.545 --> 02:13.181
Local ranch owner out in Waipahu
called in a report.

02:13.249 --> 02:15.384
Said he was on his ATV
tooling around his property

02:15.451 --> 02:16.718
and he found
what looked like

02:16.769 --> 02:18.654
pieces of burnt money.

02:18.721 --> 02:20.756
Really? How much?

02:20.823 --> 02:22.157
Don't know.

02:22.225 --> 02:24.326
But it took four officers
half a day to collect it all.

02:24.394 --> 02:25.360
We're going to run
the pieces

02:25.461 --> 02:26.762
that still have
the serial numbers intact,

02:26.829 --> 02:28.430
try to figure out
where it came from.

02:40.043 --> 02:41.343
<i>That's impossible.</i>

02:41.411 --> 02:42.844
Kono and I both saw
that money burn.

02:42.912 --> 02:44.630
Not all of it, apparently.

02:44.714 --> 02:46.181
Once HPD starts checking
those serial numbers,

02:46.249 --> 02:48.183
they're going to know
that that money was stolen

02:48.251 --> 02:49.785
from the asset forfeiture locker.
Okay, maybe,

02:49.852 --> 02:52.287
but there's no hard evidence
that traces it back to us.

02:52.355 --> 02:53.789
And besides, technically,
the money's all there.

02:53.856 --> 02:54.956
Somebody returned
the money,

02:55.024 --> 02:56.591
the exact amount that
we stole, remember?

02:56.659 --> 02:57.893
...HPD has shown
improvements

02:57.960 --> 02:59.895
across the board in every district.
Perfect.

02:59.962 --> 03:01.129
Aloha, Steve.

03:01.197 --> 03:02.130
Inspector Kelly.

03:02.198 --> 03:04.116
Aloha, Governor.
Morning.

03:04.200 --> 03:05.367
Miss Hills.

03:05.434 --> 03:06.868
Detective Kelly.

03:06.936 --> 03:08.937
Uh, you'll excuse us?

03:10.990 --> 03:12.958
When you going to ask her out?

03:13.042 --> 03:14.543
Who, Miss Hills?

03:14.610 --> 03:16.311
No, the governor.
Who do you think?

03:16.379 --> 03:20.615
Every time we see Laura,
she's sexting you with her eyes.

03:20.667 --> 03:22.450
Come on.

03:22.502 --> 03:23.785
What, are you kidding me?

03:23.853 --> 03:26.555
For a great detective, you're
really clueless sometimes.

03:28.675 --> 03:31.326
Hey, I was just
about to call you.

03:31.394 --> 03:32.794
Guess who got another
special delivery today.

03:32.845 --> 03:34.162
Another envelope.

03:34.230 --> 03:36.014
Every Wednesday.
It's like clockwork.

03:36.099 --> 03:37.332
No unknown prints.

03:37.400 --> 03:38.600
I already checked.
Security just dropped it off

03:38.651 --> 03:40.135
a few minutes ago.
I guess it showed up

03:40.203 --> 03:41.803
early this morning
in the mailroom.

03:41.854 --> 03:44.823
Same handwriting, same ink,
same envelope as all the rest.

03:46.859 --> 03:48.610
The skeleton key.

03:48.678 --> 03:49.778
This thing drove me crazy.

03:49.829 --> 03:51.346
I tried every lock in the house,

03:51.414 --> 03:53.115
even tried Dad's old desk
at HPD.

03:53.182 --> 03:54.149
You remember? Didn't fit.

03:54.200 --> 03:55.534
Didn't fit anything.

03:55.618 --> 03:58.653
Actually, um, based on
the photos of all the evidence

03:58.705 --> 04:00.989
that your father collected,
I did a little digging.

04:01.040 --> 04:02.507
Turns out,
that key belongs

04:02.592 --> 04:05.711
to a piece of antique American
furniture from the 1800s.

04:05.795 --> 04:07.129
My father never owned

04:07.180 --> 04:08.130
anything like that.

04:08.197 --> 04:09.297
Then, whose key is it?

04:09.365 --> 04:10.498
Maybe the person

04:10.550 --> 04:12.801
he was investigating.

04:12.869 --> 04:15.170
Violent crimes
is down seven percent,

04:15.221 --> 04:17.005
property crimes down four,

04:17.072 --> 04:20.442
and the year-to-year
clearance rate is up eight.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.844
Looks like your Five-O
task force is making an impact.

04:22.895 --> 04:24.379
Yes, but let's not
sell HPD short.

04:24.447 --> 04:25.647
They've been
doing great work.

04:25.715 --> 04:27.149
Make sure you give the
commissioner an "attaboy"

04:27.200 --> 04:28.567
for me when
you see him.

04:28.651 --> 04:29.701
Yes, ma'am.

04:29.786 --> 04:33.054
Oh, and, Laura,
it's perfectly all right

04:33.122 --> 04:35.356
for a lady to make
the first move.

04:35.408 --> 04:36.458
I'm sorry?

04:36.525 --> 04:37.793
Inspector Kelly.

04:37.860 --> 04:39.711
Call him.

04:39.796 --> 04:41.913
Do it now.

04:41.998 --> 04:43.331
Yes, ma'am.

05:02.718 --> 05:04.986
Laura! Laura!

05:11.077 --> 05:12.077
Laura!

05:13.830 --> 05:15.614
Governor.

05:15.698 --> 05:17.582
Are you hurt?
Are you okay?

05:23.230 --> 05:27.230

== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

05:51.901 --> 05:54.102
I see a linear shaped
cut in the metal

05:54.153 --> 05:55.987
coming from
the steering column.

05:56.072 --> 05:58.623
Looks like our killer
used some detonating cord,

05:58.708 --> 06:00.742
which means
that the initial blast

06:00.810 --> 06:03.245
came from
the wheel itself.

06:03.312 --> 06:04.880
That's bomb fragments?

06:04.947 --> 06:06.114
Yeah. Be careful.

06:06.165 --> 06:07.916
You guys get anything?

06:07.967 --> 06:09.584
Yeah, potential trace.

06:09.652 --> 06:13.388
Kaye said the bomb came
from the steering wheel column.

06:13.455 --> 06:14.923
Those look like BB's

06:14.974 --> 06:16.091
from a BB gun.

06:16.142 --> 06:17.292
No.

06:17.360 --> 06:20.161
These are projectiles
from a claymore mine.

06:20.229 --> 06:21.897
You're absolutely right.

06:21.964 --> 06:24.165
I found this

06:24.233 --> 06:26.535
electric blasting cap wire
attached to the car's ignition.

06:26.602 --> 06:28.403
It's from a claymore.

06:28.470 --> 06:29.738
I've seen this kind

06:29.805 --> 06:31.239
of improvised
device before.

06:31.307 --> 06:32.274
Wait a second. Whoa.

06:32.341 --> 06:33.909
Tell me you know who did this.

06:33.976 --> 06:35.477
Yeah.

06:35.545 --> 06:36.978
The person who rigged this car

06:37.046 --> 06:39.180
is the same man
behind the murder of my fiancé

06:39.248 --> 06:40.815
and your parents.

06:40.883 --> 06:43.151
It was Wo Fat.

06:48.325 --> 06:49.792
<i>The improvised explosive device</i>

06:49.859 --> 06:52.695
is one of Wo Fat's
preferred ways of execution,

06:52.762 --> 06:55.164
especially when he's trying
to send a message.

06:55.232 --> 06:56.665
Okay, wait, you think

06:56.716 --> 06:58.634
Wo Fat did this? I
mean, it seems sloppy.

06:58.702 --> 07:03.138
Mm... he's not sloppy,
he's vindictive.

07:03.206 --> 07:04.440
Think about it.

07:04.507 --> 07:05.841
You took out Victor Hesse
and the Yakuza here--

07:05.909 --> 07:06.842
his right and left hands.

07:06.910 --> 07:08.877
You made it personal.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.646
Yeah? Well, he's really
going to be pissed when I toss

07:10.713 --> 07:12.414
his ass in a cell
for the rest of his life,

07:12.482 --> 07:13.515
isn't he?
All right,

07:13.583 --> 07:15.017
what else do we know
about this thing?

07:16.419 --> 07:17.653
Once the ignition engages,

07:17.720 --> 07:20.155
approximately 700 steel balls,

07:20.223 --> 07:22.891
about an eighth of an inch in
diameter, shoot out at around

07:22.959 --> 07:25.394
4,000 feet per second through
the interior of the vehicle--

07:25.445 --> 07:28.597
a directional blast aimed square
at the face of the driver.

07:28.665 --> 07:31.951
It's a very personal,
targeted attack.

07:33.303 --> 07:34.937
She never felt a thing.

07:35.939 --> 07:37.239
No, she didn't.

07:38.575 --> 07:40.743
All right, Sang Min warned us
that Wo Fat was coming,

07:40.810 --> 07:42.177
so targeting one of us
I understand,

07:42.245 --> 07:43.178
but why Laura Hills?

07:43.246 --> 07:44.579
I don't know.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.348
But our best chance
at tracking Wo Fat

07:46.416 --> 07:47.616
is through
this explosive.

07:47.684 --> 07:49.618
Where would he get his hands
on a claymore in Hawaii?

07:49.686 --> 07:51.053
The military?
Hold on.

07:51.121 --> 07:52.688
Somebody breaks into a military
base and steals a crate

07:52.756 --> 07:54.456
full of mines, don't you think
we would've heard about it?

07:54.524 --> 07:55.758
No, no, no, wait a minute.

07:55.859 --> 07:57.226
If there was a theft
of military explosives,

07:57.277 --> 07:59.261
the police would be the last
people the military would call.

07:59.329 --> 08:01.230
They'd want to keep
the investigation in-house.

08:01.298 --> 08:02.931
Kaye, double-check with
all the bases on the Island,

08:02.999 --> 08:04.266
see if any claymores
have gone missing.

08:04.334 --> 08:05.734
Sure.

08:05.802 --> 08:07.036
I also have some contacts

08:07.103 --> 08:08.437
on the black and
gray markets.

08:08.505 --> 08:10.072
I can see if they know any of

08:10.140 --> 08:11.940
the munitions dealers here.
Okay, good. Chin, Kono,

08:12.008 --> 08:13.375
you guys search
Laura's office.

08:13.443 --> 08:14.877
Danny and I
will check the house.

08:14.944 --> 08:17.813
There's got to be a reason
Hills was targeted.

08:33.330 --> 08:35.798
Door's open.

08:41.571 --> 08:43.572
♪ ♪

09:07.497 --> 09:09.198
Clear.

09:09.265 --> 09:12.034
It must've happened
in the last few hours--

09:12.102 --> 09:13.686
after Hills went
to work this morning.

09:13.770 --> 09:15.437
This was definitely
not a robbery.

09:15.505 --> 09:18.307
Okay, they didn't take the TV,
didn't take the laptop.

09:18.375 --> 09:19.674
They were looking for something.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.810
Look at this.

09:21.878 --> 09:24.780
First two drawers have been
yanked out, dumped on the floor.

09:24.848 --> 09:26.565
The last one's
left undisturbed.

09:26.649 --> 09:27.716
All right.

09:27.784 --> 09:30.386
Maybe, uh...
maybe they got interrupted.

09:30.453 --> 09:31.854
Yeah.

09:31.921 --> 09:33.855
Or they found
what they were looking for.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.224
I'll call HPD,
have them run prints,

09:35.323 --> 09:36.056
process this place.

09:36.143 --> 09:36.993
Maybe someone
got sloppy.

09:37.005 --> 09:37.872
Danny.
Huh?

09:38.553 --> 09:39.986
Check this out.

09:43.658 --> 09:46.359
Okay, this may be a coincidence,
all right?

09:48.362 --> 09:50.196
These are the exact
same envelopes

09:50.248 --> 09:51.381
I've been getting sent.
Come on.

09:51.466 --> 09:52.799
You think Laura Hills
was the one

09:52.867 --> 09:54.634
sending those?
I don't know.

09:54.702 --> 09:55.635
They're envelopes, Steve.

09:55.703 --> 09:58.505
What are you doing?

09:58.556 --> 10:00.891
Getting a writing sample.

10:04.779 --> 10:06.212
It's a match.

10:06.264 --> 10:08.315
That's Laura Hills' writing
on those envelopes.

10:08.382 --> 10:10.317
Here, see for yourself.

10:10.384 --> 10:12.552
Full lower loop on her G's,

10:12.603 --> 10:15.088
along with a distinct
upstroke on her T's.

10:15.156 --> 10:17.074
Only difference between
the two samples

10:17.158 --> 10:19.092
are slant and pressure.
She was definitely stressed out

10:19.160 --> 10:20.327
when she addressed
these envelopes to you.

10:20.394 --> 10:21.328
How can you tell?

10:21.395 --> 10:22.496
She used heavy pressure,

10:22.563 --> 10:24.247
which indicates she was uptight.

10:24.332 --> 10:26.099
Very serious
about what she was doing.

10:26.167 --> 10:28.468
And the letters
are artificially upright--

10:28.536 --> 10:30.236
no slant right or left.

10:30.288 --> 10:31.571
She was trying
to cover up her tracks.

10:31.639 --> 10:33.874
Yeah. Laura did not want
anybody to know

10:33.941 --> 10:35.876
that she was sending me evidence
from my father's toolbox.

10:35.927 --> 10:37.844
Chin and I searched her office
from top to bottom.

10:37.912 --> 10:39.212
If she had any more
of his things,

10:39.263 --> 10:40.297
they weren't there.

10:40.381 --> 10:42.082
Okay, the thing
I don't get is that

10:42.150 --> 10:43.750
this evidence
was stolen by the Yakuza.

10:43.818 --> 10:45.385
How'd Laura get her hands on it?

10:45.453 --> 10:46.803
Maybe she worked for Wo Fat.

10:48.156 --> 10:50.607
Yeah, or she took it
from somebody who did.

10:50.725 --> 10:51.658
Kaye,

10:51.726 --> 10:53.593
what do you got?
I pulled a serial number

10:53.644 --> 10:55.095
off a fragment of the claymore

10:55.163 --> 10:56.897
and tracked it down.
You were right.

10:56.948 --> 10:58.431
it turns out there was a theft

10:58.483 --> 10:59.666
and the military conducted
their own investigation.

10:59.734 --> 11:01.234
The mine was stolen

11:01.285 --> 11:05.405
four years ago from a shipment
that was destined for Iraq.

11:05.456 --> 11:06.823
C.I.D. investigated
a defense contractor

11:06.908 --> 11:08.542
by the name of Dale O'Reilly,

11:08.609 --> 11:10.794
but never convicted him
or recovered

11:10.878 --> 11:12.295
any of the stolen shipment.

11:12.380 --> 11:14.281
Any idea where O'Reilly is now?

11:24.692 --> 11:26.292
Well, hope you like it.

11:26.344 --> 11:28.662
This is what's it's going
to look like when you die.

11:28.729 --> 11:30.330
This is your heaven.

11:30.398 --> 11:31.531
Want anything while we're here?

11:31.599 --> 11:32.799
New ammo belt?

11:32.850 --> 11:35.685
Night vision goggles? Ooh.

11:35.770 --> 11:37.270
Ooh. Powdered eggs.
Let me tell you something,

11:37.321 --> 11:39.139
I'd take powdered eggs
over your eggs any day.

11:39.207 --> 11:40.674
My eggs... you love my eggs.

11:40.741 --> 11:42.409
Terrible, Danny.

11:43.528 --> 11:45.529
Hello, Dale.

11:50.418 --> 11:52.836
Hey, excuse me.
Excuse me.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.154
Dale O'Reilly?

11:54.222 --> 11:55.322
No. He's not here.

11:55.389 --> 11:57.674
That's funny.

11:57.758 --> 12:00.010
You must have a twin.

12:03.698 --> 12:05.031
Sorry, fellas.
Uh, never know

12:05.099 --> 12:06.666
who's going to come looking
for you. Know what I mean?

12:06.734 --> 12:08.134
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

12:08.202 --> 12:11.137
Like somebody who might
be in the market for a...

12:11.189 --> 12:12.606
I don't know-- claymore mine?

12:13.641 --> 12:15.642
Claymore mine?

12:22.450 --> 12:23.700
Ah, ah, ah!

12:23.784 --> 12:26.570
I will shoot you in the face.
Put it down!

12:28.706 --> 12:30.540
Hey, Dale.

12:30.625 --> 12:32.592
My eyes! My eyes!

12:32.660 --> 12:35.028
Okay.

12:35.079 --> 12:36.863
I'll take the pepper spray,
and my buddy wants

12:36.931 --> 12:39.716
some powdered eggs.
Who'd you sell the claymore to?

12:39.800 --> 12:41.701
Answer my question--
who'd you sell the claymore to?

12:41.752 --> 12:43.637
McGarrett!

12:43.704 --> 12:45.872
His name's
Steve McGarrett!

12:55.149 --> 12:56.650
Okay, um...

12:56.717 --> 13:00.186
you are definitely going down
for accessory to murder.

13:00.238 --> 13:02.439
Okay, so at this point,
if I could help you,

13:02.523 --> 13:04.741
I would say that you should
try to help yourself.

13:06.027 --> 13:09.462
Okay? Just tell me who
told you to say that name.

13:11.699 --> 13:14.935
Okay. Was it this guy?

13:15.002 --> 13:16.920
Was it Wo Fat?

13:17.004 --> 13:19.439
Dale. Dale!
Come on!

13:19.473 --> 13:21.875
We already tracked down
the $50,000 that he paid you.

13:26.631 --> 13:28.247
Okay.

13:28.299 --> 13:29.716
Well, let me tell you something

13:29.767 --> 13:32.435
about this guy, okay?

13:32.520 --> 13:36.640
He used that claymore
to kill a government official.

13:38.192 --> 13:40.260
An innocent woman.
Someone I knew.

13:41.929 --> 13:43.947
I'm not talking to you.

13:44.031 --> 13:46.199
Not talking to you?

13:46.266 --> 13:49.319
Not talking to him?

13:49.403 --> 13:51.788
That's okay.

13:51.872 --> 13:53.907
Maybe you'd be willing
to talk to somebody else.

13:56.310 --> 13:58.044
Dale.

13:58.112 --> 13:59.846
You all right?

13:59.914 --> 14:01.281
Come on, talk to me, little bro.

14:01.349 --> 14:02.482
Gary.

14:02.550 --> 14:05.852
The LT just called me in
off a recon detail.

14:05.920 --> 14:08.288
Said you were in some kind
of trouble. What's going on?

14:11.892 --> 14:14.327
Dale. You still there?

14:19.684 --> 14:20.967
Next time you see your brother,

14:21.035 --> 14:23.636
it's going to be in
a federal courtroom.

14:23.688 --> 14:25.372
You're going to be
charged with treason--

14:25.439 --> 14:26.639
crimes against
your country.

14:26.707 --> 14:28.308
You're going to be
branded as a terrorist,

14:28.376 --> 14:30.443
and your whole family's going
to suffer as a consequence.

14:30.511 --> 14:32.012
You understand me?
Your brother Gary--

14:32.079 --> 14:34.647
he's going to be disgraced,
and he's going to be forced

14:34.699 --> 14:36.016
to leave the service,

14:36.083 --> 14:38.418
all because you wouldn't
open your mouth today.

14:41.889 --> 14:43.840
<i>Nice work.</i>

14:43.924 --> 14:46.192
Between the claymore
and O'Reilly's testimony,

14:46.260 --> 14:47.510
we have Wo Fat cold.

14:47.595 --> 14:50.347
Yeah, now all we have
to do is find him.

14:50.431 --> 14:52.682
I just got off the phone
with the crime lab.

14:52.767 --> 14:54.333
They finished processing
Laura Hills's house.

14:54.385 --> 14:55.835
They find any other
prints besides hers?

14:55.886 --> 14:57.137
They found prints

14:57.204 --> 14:59.105
all over the place--
McGarrett's.

14:59.173 --> 15:00.807
How is that possible?

15:00.875 --> 15:03.276
You ever been there
before today?

15:03.343 --> 15:05.311
No, never.

15:05.363 --> 15:07.280
Somebody sure as hell wants HPD
to think you were.

15:07.348 --> 15:08.698
Why?

15:08.783 --> 15:10.784
You're being set up.

15:15.927 --> 15:17.361
<i>Again, I am</i>

15:17.429 --> 15:20.564
so sorry for your loss.

15:20.615 --> 15:21.899
I know.

15:21.967 --> 15:24.702
We are all
still in shock here.

15:24.769 --> 15:27.771
Laura was
a very special girl.

15:32.611 --> 15:34.044
Oh, of course. Of course.

15:34.112 --> 15:36.780
If we learn anything,
you'll be the first to know.

15:37.949 --> 15:39.166
Okay.

15:39.251 --> 15:41.585
Mahalo.

15:44.456 --> 15:46.957
Laura's parents.

15:47.025 --> 15:49.960
They were in New York
celebrating their anniversary.

15:51.680 --> 15:53.497
We're very sorry, ma'am.
That's, uh...

15:53.565 --> 15:55.499
that's an extremely
difficult call to make.

15:55.567 --> 15:57.001
Please tell me
you have something.

15:57.068 --> 15:58.819
We do.

15:58.904 --> 16:00.304
We know who killed Laura.

16:01.573 --> 16:03.574
His name is Wo Fat.

16:03.642 --> 16:06.911
He's an international arms
dealer with deep ties

16:06.978 --> 16:08.979
to the Japanese Yakuza.
He also has connections

16:09.047 --> 16:11.448
to the local branch here in Hawaii.
And why do you think

16:11.516 --> 16:13.417
he had something to do
with Laura's death?

16:13.485 --> 16:15.452
Because we have a guy
in custody right now

16:15.504 --> 16:18.822
who sold Wo Fat the explosives
responsible for her death,

16:18.890 --> 16:20.591
and he made a
positive I.D.

16:20.658 --> 16:22.259
Soon as he sits
with an attorney,

16:22.327 --> 16:23.878
he's going to give us
a full statement

16:23.962 --> 16:25.029
in exchange for leniency.

16:25.096 --> 16:26.697
HPD's taking him
to jail right now.

16:26.765 --> 16:28.966
Very good work, gentlemen.

16:30.602 --> 16:33.537
So how close are you
to finding this Wo Fat?

16:33.605 --> 16:35.206
Not close enough.

16:35.273 --> 16:37.775
Well, we're still piecing
some things together, uh,

16:37.842 --> 16:40.277
but if it's okay with you,
uh, we'd like to ask you

16:40.345 --> 16:41.612
a couple questions
about Laura.

16:41.679 --> 16:43.214
Of course.
I'll do anything

16:43.281 --> 16:44.348
I can to help.

16:44.416 --> 16:46.350
Okay. Uh, did she ever
mention the name

16:46.418 --> 16:48.052
Wo Fat to you?

16:48.119 --> 16:49.053
No.

16:49.120 --> 16:51.388
What about
her behavior?

16:51.456 --> 16:54.858
Uh, recently...
anything off or strange?

16:54.926 --> 16:56.660
Strange? No.

16:56.728 --> 17:00.331
She was the same Laura
I always knew.

17:02.767 --> 17:04.535
Tell me...

17:04.603 --> 17:06.737
why do you think
she was murdered?

17:06.805 --> 17:10.473
We're not sure, but we're, uh...
we're working on that.

17:10.541 --> 17:12.343
You know what, ma'am?
Thank you so much

17:12.394 --> 17:14.011
for your time today.

17:14.079 --> 17:16.079
We understand it's been
a very difficult day.

17:17.115 --> 17:18.232
Steve.

17:19.984 --> 17:21.919
This is very personal to me.

17:23.221 --> 17:24.588
You find this man--

17:24.656 --> 17:27.023
by any means necessary.

17:27.092 --> 17:28.525
Yes, ma'am.

17:29.561 --> 17:31.061
Thank you.

17:40.622 --> 17:43.123
Thank you.

17:43.208 --> 17:44.408
What's with you?

17:44.459 --> 17:46.093
Give me a second.
He can't hear us.

17:47.128 --> 17:49.546
Hey.

17:49.598 --> 17:50.764
All right, let's go.

17:50.849 --> 17:52.182
What's going on with you?

17:52.250 --> 17:53.517
Why didn't you tell
the governor about

17:53.584 --> 17:55.019
the envelopes Laura Hills
was sending you?

17:55.086 --> 17:57.254
Did you see the bureau
in her office?

17:57.305 --> 17:58.606
Early American, 1800s,
brass fixtures?

17:58.690 --> 17:59.890
Oh, yeah, it was beautiful.

17:59.941 --> 18:01.592
What are you, the host
of <i>Antiques Roadshow?</i>

18:01.660 --> 18:02.893
No. Looking at furniture?

18:02.961 --> 18:04.561
What's the matter with you?
What if the brass key

18:04.613 --> 18:05.896
that Laura Hills sent me
fits that lock?

18:05.964 --> 18:08.532
I don't know.
What are you getting at?

18:08.599 --> 18:11.835
Huh?
I think the governor's hiding something.

18:18.276 --> 18:19.776
When did you get so uptight?
Will you relax?

18:19.828 --> 18:21.445
- Relax?
- I'll be in and out in two minutes.

18:21.446 --> 18:22.076
Two minutes.

18:22.079 --> 18:23.103
You'll be... there's
security all over that place.

18:23.104 --> 18:25.367
- Always. What are you talking about?
- Let me tell you something, all right?

18:25.417 --> 18:27.084
The governor has a press
conference in a couple hours.

18:27.135 --> 18:28.752
I'll make my move then.
It'll be fine.

18:28.803 --> 18:30.620
Okay. Let me just make
a statement, okay?

18:30.672 --> 18:31.805
Out of the top ten

18:31.840 --> 18:33.957
dopiest suggestions
you have ever had,

18:34.009 --> 18:35.625
this is number one
with a bullet.

18:35.677 --> 18:37.895
What idea is that?
Oh, I'll tell you.

18:37.962 --> 18:40.630
He, uh... he wants to break
into the governor's mansion.

18:40.682 --> 18:43.600
All those who think that's
a certifiably demented idea,

18:43.652 --> 18:45.803
please raise your hand.

18:46.804 --> 18:48.472
Please raise
your hand.

18:48.523 --> 18:50.324
I'm new. I didn't think
I got a vote.

18:50.408 --> 18:51.575
You don't get a vote.

18:51.642 --> 18:53.243
Okay, and the rest of you
are forgetting

18:53.311 --> 18:54.478
that Five-O
is not a democracy;

18:54.529 --> 18:55.812
it's a benevolent dictatorship.

18:55.864 --> 18:57.114
Got it?
Why would you want

18:57.182 --> 18:58.615
to break into
the governor's mansion?

18:58.683 --> 19:01.285
The key that Laura Hills sent me
from my father's tool box

19:01.336 --> 19:03.170
goes to an old antique bureau.

19:03.254 --> 19:05.155
All right? The exact same

19:05.223 --> 19:07.591
antique bureau that's in
the governor's study.

19:07.658 --> 19:09.326
Okay, if the key fits...

19:09.377 --> 19:11.995
what do you think you're
going to find in there?

19:12.063 --> 19:13.514
The rest of my
father's stuff.

19:13.598 --> 19:14.664
McGarrett.

19:14.716 --> 19:17.501
Wait, wait, wait.
What? What? What?

19:17.552 --> 19:18.936
When?

19:19.003 --> 19:20.104
All right, we're on the way.

19:20.171 --> 19:22.106
What happened?
That was HPD.

19:22.173 --> 19:25.242
The transport taking O'Reilly
to prison just got hit.

19:54.139 --> 19:55.389
Two good cops-- dead.

19:55.473 --> 19:56.640
Yeah.

19:56.708 --> 19:58.475
And the only witness we had

19:58.543 --> 20:00.110
against Wo Fat.
How did he know, huh?

20:00.178 --> 20:01.762
How did he know?
How did this happen?

20:01.846 --> 20:03.580
Come here, come here,
come here, come here.

20:03.648 --> 20:06.450
Come here. Come here.

20:06.518 --> 20:08.018
Relax. Come
here. Relax.

20:08.069 --> 20:10.237
Stop. Talk to me
for a second.

20:10.321 --> 20:12.089
Okay, you think
Wo Fat did this?

20:12.157 --> 20:13.723
You kidding me?
No.

20:13.775 --> 20:15.725
This had to be
a leak, Danny.

20:15.777 --> 20:17.277
Okay, all right.
But it's not HPD.

20:17.362 --> 20:19.363
Okay? They knew O'Reilly
was going to be a witness,

20:19.414 --> 20:21.832
but they did not know he was
going to testify against Wo Fat.

20:21.899 --> 20:23.250
Nobody knew that except us.

20:23.334 --> 20:25.369
The governor.

20:25.420 --> 20:27.421
Outside of Five-O, the
governor was the only person

20:27.505 --> 20:29.573
that knew that O'Reilly
could I.D. Wo Fat.

20:29.624 --> 20:31.341
The governor, Steve?
Work with me here, okay?

20:31.409 --> 20:32.743
A month ago, we walk in,

20:32.811 --> 20:34.812
she's having lunch
with Hiro Noshimuri.

20:37.682 --> 20:39.516
Hiro Noshimuri,
the head of the Yakuza,

20:39.584 --> 20:41.018
apparently an
"old friend" of hers.

20:41.085 --> 20:42.586
The governor's
in his pocket.

20:42.654 --> 20:45.255
Shh. Okay. Let's stop and think
about what you are saying.

20:45.306 --> 20:46.590
What are we talking about?

20:46.641 --> 20:48.225
We are talking about the governor.
She's only the top elected

20:48.276 --> 20:50.760
official in the state.
I don't care.

20:50.812 --> 20:52.463
If she did this,
she goes down.

20:52.530 --> 20:54.565
Okay, but you realize that this

20:54.616 --> 20:56.533
is an accusation of monster proportions.
I'm just...

20:56.601 --> 20:58.969
Massive proportions, right?
I get it. We need evidence.

20:59.037 --> 21:01.605
We need rock-solid, airtight proof.
Okay. Okay. Okay.

21:01.673 --> 21:03.407
Okay, that's right.
That's all.

21:03.458 --> 21:04.708
Now you're making sense.

21:04.775 --> 21:06.460
Okay, we can't be all bull
in the china shop.

21:06.544 --> 21:08.612
We got to use our heads, okay?
We're... we're going to look

21:08.663 --> 21:10.314
at all the evidence
that your father collected,

21:10.381 --> 21:12.616
and we're going to see
if it points to the governor.

21:12.667 --> 21:14.051
Huh?

21:14.118 --> 21:17.054
It's Rachel. Give me two seconds.
Go. Go, go.

21:17.121 --> 21:18.555
Hey. Listen, Rachel,

21:18.623 --> 21:20.424
I can't talk right now, okay?
I got to call you back.

21:20.475 --> 21:22.893
Danny, um, I need to see you.
It's important.

21:22.961 --> 21:25.295
What's the matter?
You sound upset. You okay?

21:25.346 --> 21:27.064
I just need to see you.
Can you meet me

21:27.131 --> 21:28.632
at the end of Sand Island
in an hour?

21:30.068 --> 21:32.603
Yeah, I'll be there
in one hour, okay?

21:34.489 --> 21:35.772
You all right?

21:35.824 --> 21:37.741
Yeah, I'm fine.

21:37.808 --> 21:38.992
Look.

21:39.077 --> 21:40.911
You're running
on fumes right now.

21:40.979 --> 21:43.330
Okay? I want you
to go home.

21:43.414 --> 21:45.315
Get some rest.
You wake up in the morning,

21:45.366 --> 21:47.784
we look at the evidence,
we come up with a game plan.

21:47.836 --> 21:48.919
We got to be smart
about this, right?

21:48.987 --> 21:49.953
Yeah.
Right?

21:50.021 --> 21:51.054
Right.
All right. Come on.

22:09.107 --> 22:11.108
♪ ♪

23:36.160 --> 23:38.145
♪ ♪

23:53.962 --> 23:55.462
What's going on?
What's the matter?

23:55.546 --> 23:56.630
It's nothing.

23:56.714 --> 23:58.515
I just need to talk
to you about something.

23:58.583 --> 24:00.317
Okay.

24:03.421 --> 24:04.788
What's going on?

24:04.856 --> 24:06.590
You having second thoughts
about telling Stan?

24:06.658 --> 24:08.892
No.

24:08.960 --> 24:10.560
That's not it at all.

24:10.628 --> 24:12.145
Hey, listen to me.

24:12.230 --> 24:14.297
Whatever it is, you
can tell me, okay?

24:14.349 --> 24:16.867
Anything. I'm right here.

24:19.237 --> 24:21.405
I'm pregnant.

24:24.542 --> 24:26.443
You're pregnant.

24:26.511 --> 24:29.496
Wow. Uh... and I'm definitely...

24:30.531 --> 24:31.698
Yes.
Okay, good.

24:31.783 --> 24:33.784
Good, good, good. Okay.

24:35.152 --> 24:37.153
Everything's going to be okay,
honey. I promise.

24:38.172 --> 24:39.840
Huh?

24:41.325 --> 24:43.026
How do I tell Stan
that I'm leaving

24:43.127 --> 24:44.761
and that I'm pregnant
with your child?

24:44.829 --> 24:46.163
I don't know.

24:46.230 --> 24:48.031
But you don't have
to do it alone.

24:48.099 --> 24:49.633
I'll come with you, all right?

24:49.701 --> 24:54.170
No. This is something
that I need to do by myself.

24:55.773 --> 24:57.708
Once it's done,
I don't want to be here.

24:57.775 --> 24:59.576
You want to leave Hawaii?

25:01.279 --> 25:04.614
This is Stan's home;
it's not mine.

25:04.682 --> 25:06.383
I already checked
with the airline.

25:06.451 --> 25:08.051
There's a red-eye to Newark

25:08.119 --> 25:10.454
that leaves
tomorrow night.

25:11.656 --> 25:13.189
All right, well,
I'm coming with you.

25:13.241 --> 25:16.259
Danny, you can't leave.
You have a life here.

25:16.327 --> 25:18.745
I have a...
I have a life here?

25:18.830 --> 25:20.931
Rachel...

25:20.998 --> 25:22.566
you and Grace are my life.

25:24.936 --> 25:26.336
The only reason I came out here

25:26.404 --> 25:28.171
in the first place
was for you guys.

25:28.239 --> 25:30.107
Wherever you are,
that's where I want to be.

25:30.174 --> 25:31.775
That's where
I'm going to be, okay?

25:33.377 --> 25:34.978
What about your job?

25:36.414 --> 25:39.483
Listen, we'll go, uh,
I'll get you settled in Jersey,

25:39.550 --> 25:43.153
and I'll come back here,
I'll wrap up all my... my cases,

25:43.221 --> 25:44.654
and then, uh, that's it.

25:44.722 --> 25:46.790
All right? It'll just be
the three of us again.

25:46.858 --> 25:48.225
All right?

25:48.292 --> 25:49.559
The four of us.

25:50.728 --> 25:51.962
Rachel, I love you.

25:58.119 --> 26:00.570
I love you, too.

26:05.209 --> 26:06.476
I should go pack.

26:06.544 --> 26:09.513
I never unpacked,
so I'm good.

26:12.216 --> 26:13.917
We're going to
have another baby.

26:26.030 --> 26:27.798
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

26:29.133 --> 26:31.601
What the hell is the matter with you?
Would it kill you

26:31.669 --> 26:33.303
to knock on this door
just once?

26:33.371 --> 26:35.104
Knock on that door?

26:35.156 --> 26:36.506
Why? What's with
the ambush?

26:36.574 --> 26:37.974
Why are you dressed
like a ninja?

26:38.042 --> 26:40.043
What are you doing?

26:42.880 --> 26:44.214
Okay. What is this?

26:44.282 --> 26:45.916
No, no, no.

26:45.983 --> 26:47.884
Don't answer.

26:47.952 --> 26:51.254
Tell me you didn't break
into the governor's house.

26:52.723 --> 26:54.324
The key fit, Danny.

26:54.392 --> 26:56.143
This is what my
father was working on

26:56.227 --> 26:58.161
before he was
murdered, Danny.

26:58.229 --> 26:59.429
He was investigating
the governor.

26:59.497 --> 27:00.981
Look at this.

27:02.733 --> 27:04.267
See for yourself.

27:04.335 --> 27:05.652
I found these
in the drawer.

27:05.736 --> 27:07.571
That's Laura Hills with
one of those envelopes.

27:07.638 --> 27:09.873
Is that your truck?
That's my truck.

27:09.941 --> 27:11.308
The governor found out

27:11.375 --> 27:13.493
that Laura was sending
me pieces of evidence

27:13.578 --> 27:15.695
from my father's toolbox.
And you know what else, Danny?

27:15.780 --> 27:17.280
I think Laura
was stealing the evidence

27:17.348 --> 27:19.015
from the governor.
That doesn't make sense, okay?

27:19.083 --> 27:20.283
Why would she do that?

27:20.334 --> 27:21.918
Why would she send you
piece by piece?

27:21.986 --> 27:23.920
The box was full of all kinds
of different stuff.

27:23.988 --> 27:25.422
I'm sure she was hoping
that the governor

27:25.489 --> 27:26.456
wouldn't notice
anything missing.

27:26.524 --> 27:28.508
Come here.

27:32.180 --> 27:34.464
This is Laura's date book, okay?

27:34.515 --> 27:36.499
Now, for the last month,
every Wednesday,

27:36.551 --> 27:38.935
I get something in an envelope
from my father's toolbox.

27:39.003 --> 27:40.070
All right? Okay?

27:40.137 --> 27:41.838
Look at this.
Let's go back a month.

27:43.140 --> 27:45.308
Every one of Laura's
Tuesday lunches is open.

27:45.376 --> 27:47.844
So what?
What happens on Tuesday?

27:47.912 --> 27:49.179
What happens on Tuesday?
The governor has

27:49.247 --> 27:50.680
a standing lunch with
the chief of police

27:50.748 --> 27:52.716
at Turtle Bay,
and Laura knew that.

27:52.783 --> 27:54.384
So wait a minute.

27:54.452 --> 27:57.888
So Laura uses that time to slip
into the governor's office...

27:57.955 --> 27:59.789
And steal us
a piece of evidence.

27:59.857 --> 28:02.025
And according to these photos
in that bureau,

28:02.093 --> 28:04.194
the governor found out about it.

28:04.262 --> 28:05.395
She had Laura killed.

28:05.463 --> 28:08.398
Laura was trying
to help me, Danny.

28:08.466 --> 28:10.600
It's my fault that she's dead.

28:17.041 --> 28:18.341
So you're saying that you think

28:18.409 --> 28:19.793
that the governor
had Laura Hills murdered?

28:19.877 --> 28:21.778
Yes, and Wo Fat
made it happen.

28:21.846 --> 28:23.646
All right, so what are we
waiting for? Let's bring her in.

28:23.714 --> 28:25.081
Whoa. Slow down. Okay?

28:25.149 --> 28:26.749
We don't have any hard
evidence proving anything.

28:26.801 --> 28:27.951
But we have these photos.

28:28.018 --> 28:29.952
Yeah, we do--
that he illegally obtained

28:30.004 --> 28:31.504
by breaking
into the governor's house.

28:31.589 --> 28:33.156
She's probably going to say

28:33.224 --> 28:34.891
that he planted them there anyway.
Yeah, he's right.

28:34.959 --> 28:36.559
This isn't some liquor store
stickup artist

28:36.627 --> 28:38.161
who everyone wants
to see locked up.

28:38.229 --> 28:41.064
We're talking about an elected
official with a spotless record

28:41.131 --> 28:42.132
and a 72%
approval rating.

28:42.133 --> 28:44.067
If we're going to take her down, we're
going to need something that sticks.

28:44.507 --> 28:46.792
Fine.
That's our focus now, okay?

28:47.338 --> 28:49.639
We silently investigate
the governor like my father did,

28:49.707 --> 28:51.407
we get something on her
and bring her down,

28:51.475 --> 28:53.376
and she leads us to Wo Fat.

28:54.811 --> 28:56.079
Yeah, Duke, what's up?

28:56.146 --> 28:57.564
You sure you don't want
your old job back?

28:57.631 --> 28:59.465
'Cause it looks
like your current one

28:59.533 --> 29:01.317
isn't going to exist
very much longer.

29:01.385 --> 29:04.120
We have a warrant
to arrest McGarrett for murder.

29:04.188 --> 29:05.788
We got a problem.

29:05.856 --> 29:07.090
HPD is on its way right now

29:07.157 --> 29:08.424
to arrest you
for killing Laura Hills.

29:16.600 --> 29:18.968
Kono, get everything
off the screens.

29:19.019 --> 29:20.169
Wipe the drives.
Wipe everything.

29:20.221 --> 29:21.304
This is ridiculous.

29:21.372 --> 29:22.405
He's being set up.

29:26.544 --> 29:27.610
What are you going to do?
I don't know.

29:27.695 --> 29:29.078
I got no honest chance
of beating this

29:29.146 --> 29:30.613
if the governor's involved.
Not if I'm locked up.

29:30.681 --> 29:31.898
All right, listen.

29:31.982 --> 29:33.650
Do me a favor.
Please just lay low.

29:33.717 --> 29:35.018
Okay, we'll get something
on the governor,

29:35.085 --> 29:36.202
and we will end this.

29:36.287 --> 29:37.954
I got to go.

29:38.021 --> 29:40.206
Hey, everything-- clean house.

29:46.247 --> 29:47.797
Steve McGarrett,
hold it right there.

29:47.864 --> 29:49.365
Put down your weapon.

29:49.433 --> 29:50.866
Now!

30:39.916 --> 30:42.051
♪ ♪

30:55.199 --> 30:57.116
Did I lose another bet
I forgot about?

30:57.201 --> 30:59.118
I need a gun.

30:59.203 --> 31:00.937
A what?

31:01.005 --> 31:02.605
You heard what I said.

31:02.656 --> 31:04.040
I'm a parolee, brah.

31:04.108 --> 31:05.708
You know that.

31:05.776 --> 31:07.977
And possession of a firearm
can send me back to jail.

31:08.045 --> 31:09.445
Besides, you're a cop.

31:09.496 --> 31:11.581
Where's your gun?
I'm not a cop anymore.

31:11.632 --> 31:13.182
And I need your help.

31:14.218 --> 31:15.818
Please.

31:18.656 --> 31:20.189
Come on. This way.

31:23.327 --> 31:26.829
You never know what you're going
to need until you need it.

31:26.897 --> 31:29.098
You know what
I'm saying, brah?

31:29.166 --> 31:31.167
Yeah, I know what you're saying.

31:49.386 --> 31:51.838
Do they really think that
McGarrett killed Laura Hills?

31:51.922 --> 31:54.691
Right now, it doesn't matter
what they think, okay?

31:54.792 --> 31:55.692
It's about the evidence.

31:55.759 --> 31:57.126
It's our job
to prove that he

31:57.177 --> 31:58.928
didn't do it, okay?
I'm not going to stand

31:58.995 --> 31:59.995
around here and do nothing.

32:00.047 --> 32:02.432
What? Chin,
where are you going?

32:02.499 --> 32:03.599
Chin!

32:03.684 --> 32:04.934
Officer Kalakaua,

32:05.001 --> 32:06.369
Detective Ahuna,
Internal Affairs.

32:06.437 --> 32:07.804
I have orders to bring you in.

32:07.855 --> 32:09.105
I already told your friends

32:09.172 --> 32:10.773
that I don't know
where McGarrett is.

32:10.841 --> 32:12.525
It's got nothing to do
with the McGarrett situation.

32:12.609 --> 32:14.510
Okay, Ahuna.

32:14.578 --> 32:15.778
Then, what the
hell is it about?

32:15.846 --> 32:17.447
We got a witness
that can place Officer Kalakaua

32:17.514 --> 32:18.681
at the scene of
a break-in.

32:18.749 --> 32:19.816
What break-in?

32:19.883 --> 32:22.385
The HPD asset forfeiture locker.

32:22.453 --> 32:24.921
Apparently, you know
about some money

32:24.988 --> 32:26.656
that went missing
recently.

32:26.724 --> 32:30.193
Officer Kalakaua, I need you
to come with me right now

32:30.260 --> 32:32.211
or face charges
of obstructing an investigation.

32:32.296 --> 32:33.746
Relax, okay?

32:33.831 --> 32:36.249
She doesn't know anything.
Hey.

32:36.333 --> 32:38.534
Uh... just keep
your mouth shut.

32:38.585 --> 32:41.070
Don't say anything, okay?
We'll take care of it.

32:41.138 --> 32:43.406
All right?
Go ahead.

32:43.474 --> 32:44.724
All right.

32:44.808 --> 32:46.142
Thanks.

32:49.313 --> 32:50.680
Oh, boy.

32:50.731 --> 32:53.015
Did she really steal
that money?

32:53.067 --> 32:55.551
Mm-hmm. Well, we did.

32:55.619 --> 32:56.886
What, are you serious?

32:56.937 --> 32:58.221
We didn't have a choice.

32:58.288 --> 32:59.739
All right?
It was a ransom demand.

32:59.823 --> 33:01.074
If we didn't do it,
they were going to kill Chin.

33:01.158 --> 33:03.593
So McGarrett and Kono
used a sewer tunnel

33:03.660 --> 33:05.578
to break into the locker.
That's crazy.

33:05.662 --> 33:08.197
Hmm. Welcome to my world.

33:08.265 --> 33:10.399
I like it.
What do we do now?

33:10.451 --> 33:11.784
You like it? That's good.

33:11.869 --> 33:13.252
Uh, you are going to watch

33:13.337 --> 33:14.403
these guys.

33:14.455 --> 33:15.905
Please. Okay?

33:15.956 --> 33:16.923
And you?

33:17.007 --> 33:18.674
I'm going to find McGarrett

33:18.742 --> 33:19.792
before they do.

33:24.982 --> 33:27.116
Big guy, it's not a good time,
okay?

33:27.184 --> 33:28.417
Hold on. It's about McGarrett.

33:28.469 --> 33:30.252
What? What about McGarrett?

33:30.304 --> 33:33.523
I'm worried about him.
He just paid me a visit,

33:33.590 --> 33:36.993
loaded up for bear.
Whoa, you gave him weapons?

33:37.060 --> 33:39.428
You didn't hear that
from me, brah.

33:39.480 --> 33:41.430
I don't know who he's after,

33:41.482 --> 33:43.132
but I thought you should know.

33:43.200 --> 33:45.368
<i>He's going after the governor.</i>

34:00.165 --> 34:02.633
Come on, Steve,
answer the phone.

34:02.701 --> 34:04.785
This is McGarrett. Talk.

34:06.672 --> 34:09.674
Steve.

34:09.741 --> 34:11.409
Danny, it's Rachel.

34:11.476 --> 34:14.911
Hey, honey, listen, I-I-I can't talk
right now, okay? I'll call you back.

34:14.980 --> 34:17.148
I just wanted to let
you know we're here.

34:17.216 --> 34:18.349
You're here? You're where?

34:18.417 --> 34:19.382
The airport.

34:19.451 --> 34:21.819
Is everything all right?
Yes.

34:21.887 --> 34:24.021
Everything is fine.
Danny, if you're having

34:24.089 --> 34:25.255
second thoughts...

34:25.306 --> 34:27.692
Listen to me. I love you.
Everything is fine.

34:27.759 --> 34:29.193
I got something
to take care of,

34:29.261 --> 34:31.562
and I will meet you
at the gate, okay? I promise.

34:31.630 --> 34:32.897
Okay.

35:08.967 --> 35:10.968
♪ ♪

35:34.526 --> 35:36.010
Steve.

35:37.429 --> 35:39.397
I was hoping they
were wrong about you.

35:39.464 --> 35:43.834
I didn't kill Laura Hills.
You did.

35:43.902 --> 35:46.504
You move, I will put
a bullet in you.

35:46.571 --> 35:48.439
Put your hand on the desk!

35:48.507 --> 35:51.342
Just put the gun away
and we can talk.

35:51.410 --> 35:52.843
It goes down when we're done.

35:52.911 --> 35:55.212
What do you want?

36:00.118 --> 36:01.886
I want a confession.

36:01.953 --> 36:03.587
You have a gun pointed
at my head.

36:03.655 --> 36:05.323
I'll say whatever you want,
Steve.

36:05.390 --> 36:07.658
I want the truth.

36:07.709 --> 36:09.293
I don't know
what you're talking about.

36:09.361 --> 36:10.795
I know what you did!

36:10.862 --> 36:12.830
I know everything!

36:12.898 --> 36:15.166
Then, why don't you just
go ahead and pull the trigger.

36:15.233 --> 36:18.085
Because I want answers.
Speak.

36:19.538 --> 36:22.973
Trust me, that is not
what you want.

36:24.443 --> 36:25.943
Don't touch that phone.

36:26.011 --> 36:27.211
Don't answer it.

36:27.279 --> 36:29.547
Look at me.

36:29.614 --> 36:32.016
I know my father
was investigating you.

36:32.084 --> 36:36.187
I know about your
ties to the Yakuza.

36:36.238 --> 36:37.822
I know about
the Noshimuri brothers.

36:37.889 --> 36:39.890
I know about your connection
to Wo Fat.

36:39.958 --> 36:42.893
My father was getting close
to exposing you,

36:42.961 --> 36:44.995
wasn't he,
Governor, huh?

36:45.063 --> 36:47.398
That's why my mother
died in that car bomb.

36:47.466 --> 36:48.766
Just like Laura Hills.

36:48.834 --> 36:51.068
But what I really
want to know

36:51.136 --> 36:53.704
is who gave the order.

36:53.772 --> 36:56.674
I know Koji Noshimuri set the
car bomb that killed my mother.

36:56.742 --> 36:59.243
I know Victor Hesse

36:59.311 --> 37:00.911
killed my father.

37:00.979 --> 37:05.916
But I want to know--
who gave the order, Governor?

37:05.984 --> 37:10.654
Was it Wo Fat, or was it you?

37:11.957 --> 37:15.326
You captured the man who shot
and killed your father.

37:17.028 --> 37:18.963
You took down
the people responsible

37:19.030 --> 37:20.765
for your mother's murder.

37:22.401 --> 37:25.569
I gave you the ability
to do that.

37:25.637 --> 37:29.640
I gave you the immunity
and the means.

37:29.708 --> 37:31.075
I protected you.

37:31.143 --> 37:33.744
And when you got into trouble,
I got you out of it.

37:36.047 --> 37:38.649
You put the money in the asset
forfeiture locker, didn't you?

37:38.717 --> 37:40.151
You covered for us.

37:41.887 --> 37:43.654
I was trying to protect you.

37:43.722 --> 37:46.624
Five-O has done a lot
for the people of Hawaii.

37:46.691 --> 37:48.592
I wanted that work to continue.

37:48.660 --> 37:50.394
Stop lying to me!

37:50.462 --> 37:53.681
You created Five-O
so you could keep an eye on me.

37:53.765 --> 37:57.735
So I wouldn't pick up where my
father left off. Isn't that right?

37:57.803 --> 38:00.171
You keep friends close, but you
keep your enemies even closer?

38:00.238 --> 38:02.339
I am not the enemy, Steve.

38:02.407 --> 38:04.942
I have always been loyal

38:05.010 --> 38:07.178
to the people
who are loyal to me.

38:07.245 --> 38:09.079
Really?

38:09.147 --> 38:11.982
Is that why you had
Laura Hills murdered?

38:12.050 --> 38:14.385
Because she was the least loyal?

38:17.088 --> 38:18.522
Yes.

38:27.516 --> 38:29.133
What are we going to do?

38:29.184 --> 38:30.968
We have to get rid of him.

38:32.404 --> 38:34.405
I have everything under control.

39:06.037 --> 39:08.889
Duke, get EMS out here.
Set up a perimeter.

39:08.974 --> 39:11.141
Roadblocks every half mile.
Yes, sir, Lieutenant.

39:11.209 --> 39:13.210
The rest of you guys
come with me.

39:20.318 --> 39:21.735
Check the governor.

39:21.820 --> 39:25.556
Steve, put the gun down now.

39:29.461 --> 39:31.579
Take it.

39:31.663 --> 39:32.696
Duke?
She's dead.

39:36.117 --> 39:39.503
It wasn't me, Chin.
It was Wo Fat.

39:39.571 --> 39:44.041
We checked the house.
Nobody's here.

39:44.092 --> 39:46.760
Steve McGarrett,
you're under arrest.

39:46.845 --> 39:48.479
You have the right

39:48.547 --> 39:49.713
to remain silent.

39:49.764 --> 39:51.482
Anything you say can
and will be used

39:51.550 --> 39:53.450
against you
in a court of law.

39:59.257 --> 40:01.258
Hey, hey, Chin!

40:01.326 --> 40:02.560
Danny.
Hey!

40:02.611 --> 40:03.894
What the hell are you doing?

40:03.945 --> 40:05.029
What happened?

40:05.096 --> 40:06.697
Huh?
The governor's dead.

40:06.764 --> 40:08.365
What are you talking about?

40:08.433 --> 40:09.800
It was Wo Fat.
You understand?

40:09.868 --> 40:11.235
It was Wo Fat, Danny.

40:11.286 --> 40:13.604
Let him go. Let him go.
He was the only one there.

40:13.672 --> 40:14.738
His gun was just discharged.

40:14.806 --> 40:16.240
I can't let him go.
Yes, you can.

40:16.291 --> 40:18.442
We have jurisdiction.
We're Five-O. Get him out.

40:18.510 --> 40:20.077
You don't understand, Danny.

40:20.128 --> 40:21.579
There is no Five-O anymore.

40:28.386 --> 40:30.954
What did you do, huh?
What did you do?

40:31.006 --> 40:32.222
You just went back to them

40:32.290 --> 40:34.625
after everything
they did to you?

40:34.676 --> 40:35.959
Huh?

40:39.998 --> 40:41.498
Hey.

40:41.566 --> 40:43.767
Steve, don't worry.
I'll get you out of there.

40:44.853 --> 40:46.320
Hang in there.
I'll get this thing

40:46.404 --> 40:48.355
straightened out, okay?

41:02.871 --> 41:05.055
WOMAN
Your attention, please.

41:05.123 --> 41:09.710
Final boarding call for Hawaiian
Airlines Flight 762 for Newark.

41:11.429 --> 41:14.231
Final boarding call
for Gate 34-B.

41:18.336 --> 41:20.137
Let's go, sweetheart.

41:45.296 --> 41:47.097
Number five.

41:48.533 --> 41:50.534
Number five,
please step forward.

41:59.744 --> 42:01.545
That's her.

42:01.613 --> 42:03.647
That's the woman I saw.
Are you sure?

42:03.715 --> 42:06.583
May I ask what you're doing
in front of my condo?

42:06.651 --> 42:07.718
Oh, nothing, Auntie.
We're just,

42:07.769 --> 42:09.052
you know,
doing some water stuff.

42:09.104 --> 42:11.455
Yes, I'm positive.

42:25.754 --> 42:28.072
You're going to have to turn in
your gun and badge

42:28.139 --> 42:29.807
pending an investigation.

42:37.382 --> 42:39.049
Turn and face
the camera.

42:40.285 --> 42:42.720
I said turn
and face the camera.
