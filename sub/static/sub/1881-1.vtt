Son, you spent the entire summer depressed

01:00.640 --> 01:03.200
because your girlfriend ran off
with that pretty boy, Trent.

01:03.320 --> 01:06.073
Now, you gotta get out there
and crush some ass!

01:06.200 --> 01:07.519
It's the only way to get your mind off her.

01:07.640 --> 01:10.200

Hey, Dad, why isn't Mom's name
the last name on the list there?

02:08.160 --> 02:09.070
Uh...

02:09.199 --> 02:13.352

within the group dynamic,

for sisterhood.

on the women.
