WEBVTT

00:06.640 --> 00:09.743
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.777 --> 00:12.646
- UGH.
- IT'S MY MONEY AND I'M GONNA USE IT HOW I WANT.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.215
LOOK, MAN, I'M NOT JUDGING.
I'M JUST SAYING THAT

00:14.248 --> 00:16.117
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WITH
IT IS INCREDIBLY STUPID.

00:16.150 --> 00:18.018
WHICH IS YOUR OPINION...

00:18.052 --> 00:20.354
- AS A BUSINESSMAN.
- WHO MAKES MY LUNCH.

00:21.555 --> 00:23.524
DON'T YOU GO THERE, BOY.

00:23.557 --> 00:27.395
YOU REALLY WANNA MESS WITH THE GUY WHO
DECIDES WHAT GOES IN YOUR SANDWICH?

00:27.428 --> 00:29.163
ALL RIGHT, YOU TWO,
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

00:29.197 --> 00:30.664
THERE IS NO ARGUING
IN THIS HOUSE.

00:30.698 --> 00:32.566
- BUT, JOE...
- ALL RIGHT, SHUT IT.

00:32.600 --> 00:35.069
COME ON, SERIOUSLY.
JOE DOESN'T "APPROVE"

00:35.103 --> 00:38.772
OF THE WAY I'M INVESTING MY $1,000 THAT
I INHERITED FROM GREAT AUNT FLORENCE.

00:38.806 --> 00:40.641
NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID.
OKAY, WHAT I SAID WAS

00:40.674 --> 00:42.676
IT WOULD SIMPLY SAVE TIME TO
SOAK THE CHECK IN GASOLINE

00:42.710 --> 00:45.179
AND THEN SET IT ON FIRE.

00:45.213 --> 00:47.448
I FOUND THIS AMAZING NEW COMPANY

00:47.481 --> 00:48.716
AND THEIR STOCK GOES
ON SALE TOMORROW.

00:48.749 --> 00:51.519
INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS
ARE ALWAYS RISKY, DUDE.

00:51.552 --> 00:54.622
- IT'S MY $1,000.
- YEP, NOT FOR LONG.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.490
- SO WHAT'S THE COMPANY?
- JUMPTECH.

00:56.524 --> 00:58.559
THEY INVENTED THESE SNEAKERS
THAT MAKE YOU JUMP HIGHER.

00:58.592 --> 01:00.494
MAGIC FLYING SHOES!

01:00.528 --> 01:02.029
QUICK, MEL, MORTGAGE THE HOUSE

01:02.062 --> 01:04.198
SO WE CAN GET IN ON
THIS SUREFIRE THING.

01:04.232 --> 01:07.668
- IT'S NOT MAGIC. CHECK THIS OUT.
- ( clicks )

01:07.701 --> 01:10.070
SEE? FAT GUYS AND SHORT
KIDS WEARING THE SHOES

01:10.104 --> 01:12.640
AND THEY'RE JUMPING OVER
FENCES AND SLAM-DUNKING.

01:12.673 --> 01:13.674
Mel: WOW!

01:13.707 --> 01:17.211
FINALLY, SCIENCE HAS GIVEN
US SOMETHING WE CAN USE.

01:17.245 --> 01:20.181
WELL, IT DOES USE "PATENTED
HYPER-COIL TECHNOLOGY,"

01:20.214 --> 01:23.050
WHICH IS EITHER REALLY
GOOD OR TOTALLY MADE UP.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.386
IT'S MY MONEY AND I'M NOT
GONNA MISS OUT ON THIS.

01:25.419 --> 01:28.656
I JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO OPEN
UP A BROKERAGE ACCOUNT BY TOMORROW.

01:28.689 --> 01:30.624
FINE. I WILL HELP YOU
LOSE YOUR MONEY,

01:30.658 --> 01:32.226
ALL RIGHT? I'LL BUY THE
STOCK THROUGH MY ACCOUNT.

01:32.260 --> 01:34.328
YES, I STILL HAVE AN
ACCOUNT, ALL RIGHT?

01:34.362 --> 01:36.697
CURRENTLY IT'S MORE OF A PITY
ACCOUNT, BUT I STILL HAVE ONE.

01:36.730 --> 01:38.566
OH, THIS IS GREAT, JOE.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.701
NOW YOU'LL GET TO FEEL WHAT
IT'S LIKE TO TOUCH MONEY AGAIN.

01:40.734 --> 01:42.503
TRUST ME, IT'S NICE.

01:42.536 --> 01:44.572
THANKS, JOE.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.073
HEY, LENNOX.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.709
HEY, GUESS WHAT I LEARNED
IN SCHOOL TODAY.

01:48.742 --> 01:50.811
BOYS SUCK.

01:50.844 --> 01:53.681
AS A MAN WHO WAS ONCE A BOY, I AM
SO HAPPY THAT YOU FIGURED THAT OUT.

01:53.714 --> 01:55.716
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED, SWEETIE?

01:55.749 --> 01:58.819
HASKELL AND I WERE SUPPOSED TO
MEET UP AT THE YOGURT SHOP AT 6:00

01:58.852 --> 02:00.821
TO CELEBRATE OUR
TWO-WEEK ANNIVERSARY.

02:00.854 --> 02:03.324
I GET THERE A LITTLE EARLY,
AND HE'S IN THE PARKING LOT,

02:03.357 --> 02:05.359
MAKING OUT WITH
THAT SKANK MARISSA

02:05.393 --> 02:06.860
NEAR THE DUMPSTER.

02:06.894 --> 02:09.697
THAT WAS OUR SPOT.

02:09.730 --> 02:12.099
- I MEAN, CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?
- WELL, YEAH.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.801
MARISSA'S SMOKING HOT.

02:16.370 --> 02:19.907
LIKE A PILE OF DOODY IN AUGUST.

02:21.475 --> 02:24.345
GOOD SAVE. HONEY,
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

02:24.378 --> 02:26.414
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE

02:26.447 --> 02:27.448
AND SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WOULD HAPPEN TO ME,

02:27.481 --> 02:29.717
I WOULD GRAB MY FAKE
I.D., SNEAK INTO A BAR

02:29.750 --> 02:33.287
AND DROWN MY SORROWS IN
A BIG FROSTY MUG OF...

02:33.321 --> 02:35.189
MILK.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.359
LOOK, IT'S HASKELL'S LOSS.

02:38.392 --> 02:40.494
I NEVER WANNA HEAR
THAT NAME AGAIN.

02:40.528 --> 02:42.496
IT IS NOW "THE H WORD."

02:42.530 --> 02:44.665
OKAY, ON A TOTALLY
DIFFERENT SUBJECT,

02:44.698 --> 02:47.668
HAVE YOU DECIDED WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO
WITH YOUR $1,000 FROM AUNT FLORENCE?

02:47.701 --> 02:49.370
YES.

02:49.403 --> 02:51.905
I'M GOING TO GET AN ANATOMICALLY
CORRECT HASKELL VOODOO DOLL.

02:53.874 --> 02:56.477
HELL OF A LOT BETTER
INVESTMENT THAN RYDER'S.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.612

03:21.869 --> 03:23.771
I MEAN, "H WORD'S" DAD.

03:23.804 --> 03:26.774
LISTEN, I FEEL TERRIBLE
THINGS WITH LENNOX.DED

03:26.807 --> 03:28.476
HOW'S SHE DOING?

03:28.509 --> 03:30.644
SHE'S GOING THROUGH A
WIDE RANGE OF EMOTIONS.

03:30.678 --> 03:31.912
ONE MINUTE SHE'S DEVASTATED,

03:31.945 --> 03:33.614
AND THE NEXT MINUTE SHE'S
PERFECTLY MISERABLE.

03:33.647 --> 03:36.750
ACTUALLY, IT'S SORT OF A
NARROW RANGE OF EMOTION.

03:36.784 --> 03:39.653
- THAT MUST BE REALLY HARD.
IN THE SAME ROOM WITH HER.

03:39.687 --> 03:41.655
OH, YOU MEANT FOR LENNOX.

03:41.689 --> 03:44.592
WOW, YOU GOT A LITTLE EVIL
STREAK THERE, DON'T YOU?

03:44.625 --> 03:47.628
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
IT'S NOT LITTLE.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.430
- GOOD TO KNOW.
- SERIOUSLY, THOUGH,

03:49.463 --> 03:51.899
- I THOUGHT LENNOX AND HASKELL
- YEAH.A REALLY CUTE COUPLE.

03:51.932 --> 03:54.968
RIGHT UP UNTIL THE MOMENT
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.KING OUT

03:55.002 --> 03:57.805
WELL, IN THAT AREA, HE
TAKES AFTER HIS MOTHER,

03:57.838 --> 03:59.573
WHICH IS WHY WE'RE
NO LONGER TOGETHER.

03:59.607 --> 04:01.241
OH, I'M SO SORRY

04:01.275 --> 04:03.877
TO HEAR YOU'RE AVAILABLE.

04:03.911 --> 04:05.479
HEY, YOU KNOW,

04:05.513 --> 04:07.815
WITH THE WHOLE
LENNOX-HASKELL THING,

04:07.848 --> 04:09.917
I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
EVEN BE TALKING TO YOU.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.885
YEAH, YOU KNOW, WE ARE
IN ENEMY CAMPS NOW.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.887
( imitates gunfire )

04:13.921 --> 04:17.525
SO I GUESS THERE'S NO CHANCE
OF ME ASKING YOU OUT NOW.

04:17.558 --> 04:19.660
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

04:19.693 --> 04:22.330
IN FACT, I DARE YOU.

04:22.363 --> 04:23.897
GO AHEAD.

04:28.536 --> 04:31.004
HEY, JOE, YOU NOTICE THIS GLASS?
IRD ABOUT

04:31.038 --> 04:32.673
YEAH, YOU'RE HOLDING
IT AND ( sniffs )

04:32.706 --> 04:34.908
IT DOESN'T SMELL LIKE GIN.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.243
ALL THE GLASSES COMING OUT
OF THE DISHWASHER LATELY

04:36.276 --> 04:37.878
HAVE BEEN CLOUDY.

04:37.911 --> 04:40.681
YOU WALKED ALL THE WAY
ABOUT A CLOUDY GLASS?

04:40.714 --> 04:42.816
ALL THE GLASSES. THEY
ALL HAVE SPOTS ON 'EM.

04:42.850 --> 04:44.452
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
DO ABOUT THIS?

04:44.485 --> 04:45.953
HIDE WHEN I HEAR YOUR FOOTSTEPS.

04:45.986 --> 04:48.422
OH, I'M SORRY.

04:48.456 --> 04:49.890
DO YOU WANT ME A SERIOUS PROBLEM?
AT'S

04:49.923 --> 04:52.726
MEL, I'M GONNA GET
RIGHT ON THIS.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.028
JOE, YOU WERE RIGHT
ABOUT JUMPTECH.

04:55.062 --> 04:56.864
IT DIDN'T DOUBLE ITS FIRST DAY.

04:56.897 --> 04:59.767
I'M SORRY, BUDDY. I WISH
I WASN'T RIGHT.IMES

04:59.800 --> 05:01.935
IT TRIPLED. CHECK IT OUT!

05:01.969 --> 05:03.771
- YOU'RE KIDDING.
- I'M RICH.

05:03.804 --> 05:06.039
MY STOCK IS WORTH 3 GRAND.
THANKS, JOE.

05:06.073 --> 05:07.975
I COULDN'T HAVE DONE
IT WITHOUT YOU.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.977
IT WAS ALL YOU, MAN.

05:10.010 --> 05:13.013
I... I DID NOTHING.

05:13.046 --> 05:15.315
- NICE GOING, JOE.
- I DIDN'T BUY THE STOCK.

05:15.349 --> 05:17.050
- WHAT?
- I DIDN'T BUY IT.

05:17.084 --> 05:19.820
CAN YOU CALL THEM AND TELL
THEM YOU MEANT TO BUY IT?

05:19.853 --> 05:22.055
SURE. YEAH.

05:22.089 --> 05:24.892
'CAUSE THE STOCK MARKET IS
ALL ABOUT THE HONOR SYSTEM.

05:24.925 --> 05:28.462
- BUT YOU TOLD RYDER THAT YOU BOUGHT IT.
- IT WAS A SURE LOSER.

05:28.496 --> 05:30.698
- SO YOU LIED TO HIM?
- NO, I DIDN'T LIE TO HIM.

05:30.731 --> 05:34.402
- I WAS PROTECTING HIM.
- FROM WHAT... WEALTH?

05:34.435 --> 05:36.370
LOOK, THIS IS A STUPID COMPANY
WITH AN INANE CONCEPT.

05:36.404 --> 05:38.539
THERE'S NO LOGICAL REASON
FOR IT TO HAVE GONE UP.

05:38.572 --> 05:40.908
WOW, I REALLY FEEL
TERRIBLE FOR RYDER.

05:40.941 --> 05:44.044
BUT I'M SO GLAD I'M NOT YOU.

05:44.077 --> 05:45.813
GO AHEAD, LAUGH ALL
YOU WANT, ALL RIGHT?

05:45.846 --> 05:47.915
WHEN SANITY RETURNS TO THE EARTH
TOMORROW AND THE STOCK CRASHES,

05:47.948 --> 05:49.983
HE'S GONNA THANK ME FOR
SAVING HIS THOUSAND BUCKS.

05:50.017 --> 05:52.085
HEY, LENNOX,

05:52.119 --> 05:53.954
FUNNIEST THING HAPPENED TODAY.

05:53.987 --> 05:56.957
I RAN INTO HASKELL'S
DAD GETTING COFFEE.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.959
OH, THAT'S NICE. DID YOU
TELL HIM I HOPE HIS SON

05:58.992 --> 06:01.529
FALLS LIPS FIRST
INTO A WOOD CHIPPER?

06:01.562 --> 06:03.997
NO, NOT IN THOSE EXACT WORDS.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.900
( stammers ) THERE IS SOMETHING
ELSE I WANTED TO MENTION.

06:06.934 --> 06:09.737
HASKELL'S DAD AND I WERE THINKING ABOUT...
JUST WANNA THROW THIS OUT THERE...

06:09.770 --> 06:11.672
YOU KNOW, GOING TO
GET A MEAL SOMETIME,

06:11.705 --> 06:13.941
LIKE AT DINNERTIME.

06:13.974 --> 06:17.611
DINNER? THAT'S A DATE.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

06:17.645 --> 06:19.980
WELL, IF YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT
IT, LET ME KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

06:20.013 --> 06:22.683
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'D
DO THIS TO ME.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.051
THAT'S LIKE TREASON.

06:24.084 --> 06:26.854
PICK A FAMILY, AUNT
MEL, HASKELL'S OR OURS.

06:31.024 --> 06:33.627
WOW, I REALLY FEEL
TERRIBLE FOR LENNOX.

06:33.661 --> 06:36.363
( snorts ) I'M SO
GLAD I'M NOT YOU.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.632
BOY, TALK ABOUT AN OVERREACTION.

06:38.666 --> 06:41.034
SHE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. WHAT YOU
DID WAS TOTAL AND UTTER BETRAYAL.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.771
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE I'M
DATING A FRIEND'S EX,

06:43.804 --> 06:47.107
WHICH I WOULD NEVER DO... AGAIN.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.942
I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL.

06:48.976 --> 06:51.479
COLLEGE. DROP IT!

06:51.512 --> 06:53.080
LOOK, IT'S NOT LIKE HASKELL

06:53.113 --> 06:55.048
WAS A SERIOUS BOYFRIEND
LIKE AIDAN WAS.

06:55.082 --> 06:59.019
HASKELL WAS JUST A
TWO-WEEK REBOUND GUY.

06:59.052 --> 07:00.554
MEL, THEY'RE
TEENAGERS, ALL RIGHT?

07:00.588 --> 07:03.390
TWO WEEKS IN THEIR WORLD IS
LIKE 20,000 TEXT MESSAGES.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.892
BUT THIS IS HASKELL'S DAD,

07:04.925 --> 07:06.994
AND THE SINS OF THE SONS SHALL NOT
BE VISITED UPON THE FATHERS...

07:07.027 --> 07:10.063
YOU KNOW, ESPECIALLY
THE SUPER CUTE ONES.

07:10.097 --> 07:12.800
MEL, THIS PARENTING THING
WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE,

07:12.833 --> 07:14.735
IT INVOLVES A LITTLE
BIT OF SACRIFICE.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.804
DOES IT INVOLVE ANYTHING ELSE?

07:16.837 --> 07:18.839
I'M JUST SAYING, FOR THE
HEALTH OF THE HOUSEHOLD,

07:18.872 --> 07:22.042
YOU MIGHT JUST WANNA
KEEP IT IN YOUR PANTS.

07:22.075 --> 07:24.077
BUT SAM DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
WHY SHOULD HE HAVE TO SUFFER

07:24.111 --> 07:27.114
AND NOT HAVE A CHANCE
TO GET WITH THIS?

07:28.849 --> 07:30.951
ALL RIGHT, I'LL DO
THE "RIGHT" THING.

07:33.554 --> 07:36.490
HEY, MEL, YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO WAIT FOR ME OUT HERE.

07:36.524 --> 07:38.992
YEAH, I DID. I JUST DIDN'T WANNA
GET STARTED ON THE WHOLE DINNER,

07:39.026 --> 07:40.628
- BECAUSE...
- WHAT'S UP?

07:40.661 --> 07:42.029
WELL, I'M SORRY,

07:42.062 --> 07:44.431
BUT LENNOX IS NOT A BIG FAN
OF US GOING OUT TOGETHER.

07:44.464 --> 07:45.833
OH, I SEE.

07:45.866 --> 07:49.136
SO YOU'RE SAYING WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO SNEAK AROUND?

07:49.169 --> 07:51.204
NO, I WOULD NEVER.
THAT WOULD BE WRONG.

07:51.238 --> 07:53.206
YEAH, OKAY, WELL, THEN...

07:53.240 --> 07:55.743
- I GUESS THIS IS GOODBYE.
- YEAH.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.077
YEAH.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.784
OKAY, WE CAN SNEAK AROUND.

08:10.090 --> 08:13.226
OKAY, SIGN THIS.

08:13.260 --> 08:16.496
READ THIS AND PRETEND
TO READ THIS.

08:16.530 --> 08:18.465
OH, AND REMEMBER, TODAY
YOU HAVE THAT LUNCH

08:18.498 --> 08:19.767
WITH THE OLDEST WOMAN IN TOLEDO.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.501
OH, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO POSTPONE IT.

08:21.535 --> 08:23.136
SHE'S 106.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.738
WELL, IT'LL GIVE HER
SOMETHING TO LIVE FOR.

08:24.772 --> 08:27.174
I'M SORRY, I HAVE AN
URGENT PERSONAL CONFLICT.

08:27.207 --> 08:29.910
PERSONAL? WHAT'S HIS NAME?

08:29.943 --> 08:32.045
STEPHANIE, WHEN I SAY
"SOMETHING'S PERSONAL,"

08:32.079 --> 08:35.182
IT MEANS I DON'T WANNA DISCUSS SAM.
HIS NAME'S SAM.

08:35.215 --> 08:38.518
HASKELL'S DAD? WE'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO TALK TO HIM.

08:38.552 --> 08:40.654
I'M FACEBOOK FRIENDS
WITH LENNOX.

08:40.688 --> 08:43.490
WELL, THAT'S WHY I'M
SEEING HIM SECRETLY.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.759
SPILL IT, NAUGHTY GIRL.

08:45.793 --> 08:48.629
DID YOU JUST CALL ME...
YEAH, I AM A NAUGHTY GIRL.

08:48.662 --> 08:52.099
OKAY, SO LAST NIGHT, WE WENT
TO THIS SKEEVY DIVE BAR.

08:52.132 --> 08:55.535
THE KIND OF PLACE I WOULD NEVER
GO TO THAT MUCH ANYMORE.

08:55.569 --> 08:57.971
IT WAS SO EXCITING. YOU KNOW,
IT WAS LIKE I WAS 18 AGAIN

08:58.005 --> 09:00.273
AND DATING MY DAD'S TENNIS PRO.

09:00.307 --> 09:02.075
DON'T WORRY, I'LL
CANCEL YOUR LUNCH.

09:02.109 --> 09:05.946
I'LL CLEAR YOUR WHOLE AFTERNOON.
EXACTLY HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU NEED?

09:05.979 --> 09:09.149
JUST LUNCH. YEAH, I CAN GET
A LOT DONE IN AN HOUR.

09:11.885 --> 09:15.255
HEY, RYDER, HOW'S YOUR
INVESTMENT DOING TODAY?

09:15.288 --> 09:17.224
BAD DAY. IT ONLY DOUBLED.

09:17.257 --> 09:19.793
I AM SO RICH.

09:19.827 --> 09:23.263
THE FUNNY THING IS IS NO MATTER HOW
RICH YOU GET, YOU'RE STILL A GEEK.

09:23.296 --> 09:26.266
THE LADIES LOVES THE RICH GEEKS.

09:26.299 --> 09:29.637
HEY, MAYBE YOU CAN USE SOME OF THAT
MONEY AND BUY YOURSELF A CLUE!

09:31.304 --> 09:33.573
YOU KNOW, RYDER... YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS MEANS, RIGHT?

09:33.607 --> 09:34.875
I MEAN, YOU'RE ONLY
RICH ON PAPER.

09:34.908 --> 09:37.110
THIS STOCK COULD STILL
DROP LIKE A STONE.

09:37.144 --> 09:39.312
- I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT.
- YEAH.

09:39.346 --> 09:43.283
SO WE GOTTA CASH IN. CALL YOUR
GUY AND TELL HIM TO SELL NOW.

09:43.316 --> 09:46.153
YEAH, JOE, WHY
DON'T YOU DO THAT?

09:46.186 --> 09:48.555
NO, NO, NO, NO. WHAT?
NO, NO, NO, NO.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.223
WE CAN'T PULL OUT
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.625
- WHY NOT?
- WHY? DUDE,

09:51.659 --> 09:54.161
BECAUSE WE NEED TO
THINK ABOUT THIS, MAN.

09:54.194 --> 09:56.263
- BUT YOU HATE THIS STOCK.
- YES, I DO, BUDDY, WITH ALL MY SOUL.

09:56.296 --> 09:59.599
BUT EMOTIONS SHOULD NEVER FACTOR
INTO A FINANCIAL DECISION.

09:59.633 --> 10:02.035
NO, NO, WHAT WE NEED TO
DO IS STAY THE COURSE

10:02.069 --> 10:05.605
AND, YOU KNOW, JUST PLAY
THIS WHOLE THING OUT.

10:05.639 --> 10:08.175
YOU'RE RIGHT. I MEAN, IT
COULD DOUBLE AGAIN TOMORROW.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.644
WOULDN'T THAT BE GREAT?

10:10.678 --> 10:12.746
I AM SO GLAD I'M IN
BUSINESS WITH YOU, JOE.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.147
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW, YEAH.

10:16.016 --> 10:17.985
THANK YOU FOR NOT
RATTING ME OUT.

10:18.018 --> 10:20.821
WELL, YOU KNOW, NOBODY'S PERFECT.
I DON'T JUDGE ANYONE.

10:20.854 --> 10:24.291
YEAH, YOU DO. YEAH, THAT'S
PRETTY MUCH ALL YOU DO.

10:27.661 --> 10:29.262
HEY, MEL, IT'S THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HOME?

10:29.296 --> 10:32.599
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HOME? EVERY
THURSDAY YOU JOG THE TOWPATH TRAIL

10:32.632 --> 10:35.002
- AT EXACTLY THIS TIME.
- OKAY. ( laughs )

10:35.035 --> 10:37.004
NUMBER ONE, I DON'T JOG.

10:37.037 --> 10:39.639
I RUN, OKAY? AND NUMBER TWO...

10:39.673 --> 10:42.075
OKAY, I DON'T WANNA HEAR ABOUT YOUR
NUMBER TWOS. ( clears throat )

10:42.109 --> 10:44.878
THE KIDS ARE IN SCHOOL, WHY DON'T
YOU JUST TAKE THE DAY OFF?

10:44.912 --> 10:47.214
HERE'S $10.

10:47.247 --> 10:49.649
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I'M FIXING THE
DISHWASHER. REMEMBER? CLOUDY GLASSES?

10:49.683 --> 10:52.820
- END OF THE WORLD?
- A FEW SPOTS ISN'T GONNA KILL ANYBODY.

10:52.853 --> 10:55.322
JUST GO FOR YOUR RUN. HERE...
HERE'S ANOTHER $10.

10:55.355 --> 10:58.025
YOU'RE ACTING ALL WEIRD.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:58.058 --> 10:59.893
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE UNTIL YOU
TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

10:59.927 --> 11:03.330
OKAY, SAM DAVIS IS COMING OVER.

11:03.363 --> 11:04.998
HERE? WHY?

11:05.032 --> 11:08.035
( gasps ) NO.

11:08.068 --> 11:09.937
OH, GROW UP.

11:09.970 --> 11:12.139
WAIT A MINUTE. YOU PROMISED LENNOX
THAT YOU WOULD NOT GET INVOLVED.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.107
I TRIED, BUT THEN HE KISSED ME.

11:14.141 --> 11:17.110
NOW I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO HAVE
SNEAKY, SECRET SEX WITH HIM.

11:17.144 --> 11:18.712
AND TODAY, WE'RE DOING IT HERE.

11:18.746 --> 11:21.114
WE'RE GONNA PRETEND MY
ROOM IS MY PARENTS' ROOM.

11:21.148 --> 11:22.916
OH, MY GOD. YOU ARE
SUCH A HYPOCRITE.

11:22.950 --> 11:25.318
- I AM NOT.
- YES, YOU ARE. YOU TOLD LENNOX YOU WOULDN'T GET INVOLVED

11:25.352 --> 11:26.987
WITH HASKELL'S DAD.
YOU LIED TO HER.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.989
DON'T ACT ALL HIGH AND MIGHTY.
YOU LIED TO RYDER.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.390
HEY, I LIED TO RYDER TO
PROTECT HIM, ALL RIGHT?

11:30.423 --> 11:32.359
YOU LIED TO LENNOX TO
COVER YOUR OWN BUTT.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.995
BRAVO. YOU'RE A MUCH MORE
ETHICAL LIAR THAN I AM.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.998
I'M SURE WHEN WE MEET IN HELL,
MY FLAMES WILL BE ON "HIGH,"

11:38.031 --> 11:40.667
AND YOURS WILL ONLY
BE ON "SIMMER."

11:40.700 --> 11:41.969
CAN YOU JUST SKEDADDLE
SO I CAN GET SOME

11:42.002 --> 11:44.104
IN THE PRIVACY OF MY OWN HOME?

11:44.137 --> 11:45.973
- FINE, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GOING.
- ( knock on door )

11:46.006 --> 11:48.375
BUT I'M NOT LYING FOR YOU.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.377
HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

11:50.410 --> 11:53.346
- OH, HEY, JOE.
- YEAH, I'M NOT SEEING ANYTHING.

11:53.380 --> 11:56.683
COME ON, HE WAS JUST LEAVING.

11:56.716 --> 11:59.419
GIVE ME A FIVE MINUTE HEAD START
BEFORE YOU GUYS DO ANYTHING.

12:01.855 --> 12:05.292
- HEY, JOE.
- HEY, LENNOX. LENNOX!

12:05.325 --> 12:07.727
HEY, WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU DOING HERE?
WHY AREN'T YOU AT SCHOOL?

12:07.761 --> 12:10.230
I LEFT MY HISTORY PAPER IN THE
PRINTER, AND IT'S DUE FIFTH PERIOD.

12:10.263 --> 12:13.166
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. WHERE
ARE YOU GONNA BE GOING?

12:13.200 --> 12:15.702
- TO GET MY PAPER.
- NO! NO, NO, NO, NO.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.704
MM-MM, NO, YOU CAN'T GO UPSTAIRS RIGHT NOW.
I'M CLEANING UP THERE.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.073
TRUST ME. THERE'S A LOT OF
STUFF PROBABLY HANGING OUT.

12:20.107 --> 12:22.742
YOU DON'T WANNA SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON UP THERE.

12:22.776 --> 12:24.477
- I'LL AVERT MY EYES.
- WAIT A MINUTE.

12:24.511 --> 12:27.247
LENNOX, LENNOX,
LENNOX, PLEASE...

12:27.280 --> 12:29.749
I WOULDN'T GO UP THE BACK STAIRS.
TO THE SECOND FLOOR, LENNOX,

12:29.783 --> 12:32.419
WHERE YOU'RE PROBABLY
MORE THAN HALFWAY BY NOW.

12:35.388 --> 12:38.425
- YOU GUYS OWE ME BIG TIME.
- FOR WHAT? WE DIDN'T EVEN GET TO THE GOOD STUFF.

12:38.458 --> 12:41.294
- IT WAS NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
- GET OUTTA HERE, WILL YA?

12:41.328 --> 12:43.396
JEEZ.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.868
- JEEZ, WHAT WAS THAT?
- OH, THAT? THAT WAS JUST THE DOOR.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.436
I'M JUST GOING AROUND THE HOUSE
CHECKING ALL THESE DOORS,

12:49.469 --> 12:53.040
MAKING SURE THEY'RE NOT SQUEAKING.
THIS ONE'S GOOD.

12:53.073 --> 12:55.408
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
- BACK TO SCHOOL.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.410
YEAH, BUT YOU CAME
IN THE BACK DOOR.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.279
AND I WANNA GO OUT
THE FRONT DOOR.

12:59.312 --> 13:01.248
MM-MM, NOPE, YOU CANNOT DO THAT.
NOPE, IT'S BAD LUCK.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.383
IT'S BAD LUCK. YOU HAVE TO GO OUT
THE SAME DOOR YOU CAME IN, OKAY?

13:03.416 --> 13:04.885
THAT'S JUST COMMON
FRICKIN' SENSE, LENNOX.

13:04.918 --> 13:07.787
- OKAY, I'M GOING, I'M GOING.
- ALL RIGHT.

13:07.821 --> 13:11.124
IN A CRISIS, YOU WANT LONGO.

13:17.931 --> 13:19.900
SO HOW'S RYDER'S
INVESTMENT DOING TODAY?

13:19.933 --> 13:21.869
IT'S A PIECE OF CRAP.

13:21.902 --> 13:24.838
WOW. THE PRICE OF
CRAP IS SKYROCKETING.

13:24.872 --> 13:26.439
I KNOW. THIS COMPANY
CONTINUES TO DEFY ALL LOGIC.

13:26.473 --> 13:30.010
IT JUST KEEPS GOING UP AND UP AND UP.
IT'S LIKE... LIKE...

13:30.043 --> 13:32.045
A JUMPTECH SNEAKER?

13:32.079 --> 13:33.914
( cell phone beeps )

13:33.947 --> 13:35.515
( laughing )

13:35.548 --> 13:39.019
GETTING A LITTLE TEXT MESSAGE FROM
YOUR SNEAKY SECRET BOYFRIEND?

13:39.052 --> 13:42.890
NO, A TEXT MESSAGE HAS WORDS.

13:46.259 --> 13:47.827
HE'S SENDING YOU PICTURES.
THAT'S CLASSY.

13:47.861 --> 13:49.429
HOW'D HE EVEN GET ONE
OF US DOING THAT?

13:49.462 --> 13:51.231
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE
HE HAS ANY HANDS FREE.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.402
AND MY BREAKFAST IS DONE.

13:55.435 --> 13:56.904
OH, RELAX, LONGO.

13:56.937 --> 13:59.873
WE WERE JUST DANCING NAKED.

13:59.907 --> 14:02.475
- COME ON.
- I'M JOKING.

14:02.509 --> 14:06.346
WHAT POLITICIAN WOULD BE DUMB ENOUGH TO
HAVE NAKED PICTURES ON THEIR CELL PHONE?

14:08.248 --> 14:10.283
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING, BURKE?

14:10.317 --> 14:13.253
WHY IS IT THAT I LIE TO
RYDER AND I FEEL AWFUL,

14:13.286 --> 14:15.822
YET YOU LIE TO LENNOX AND YOU'RE
HAVING THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE?

14:15.855 --> 14:19.426
WAIT A MINUTE. I FORGOT. IT'S
BECAUSE I HAVE A CONSCIENCE.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.895
I DON'T FEEL BAD BECAUSE WHAT LENNOX
DOESN'T KNOW DOESN'T HURT HER.

14:21.929 --> 14:24.297
YOU MADE RYDER
BELIEVE HE WAS RICH.

14:24.331 --> 14:26.233
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE
RIGHT, BUT I CAN FIX THAT,

14:26.266 --> 14:28.101
BECAUSE I STILL HAVE
HIS ORIGINAL $1,000.

14:28.135 --> 14:30.403
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BUY THAT
RIDICULOUS STOCK, ARE YOU?

14:30.437 --> 14:32.272
ARE YOU CRAZY? I WOULD NEVER
DO ANYTHING THAT RISKY.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.442
I'M GONNA INVEST IT IN A
HIGH-STAKES POKER GAME.

14:38.611 --> 14:40.948
HEY.

14:40.981 --> 14:44.484
HEY, AUNT MEL, IS THERE
ANYTHING YOU NEED TO TELL ME?

14:44.517 --> 14:46.153
HMM... STAY IN SCHOOL.

14:46.186 --> 14:49.056
DON'T DRINK AND DRIVE AND ALWAYS
PUT THE TOILET SEAT DOWN.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.491
WAIT, THAT'S FOR RYDER.

14:51.524 --> 14:54.461
THAT'S FUNNY, BECAUSE
I JUST HEARD TODAY

14:54.494 --> 14:56.896
THAT HASKELL'S FATHER WAS
SNEAKING AROUND WITH...

14:56.930 --> 14:59.532
WHO WAS THAT AGAIN? OH,
THAT'S RIGHT. YOU.

14:59.566 --> 15:03.170
- THAT IS A VICIOUS RUMOR.
- IS IT TRUE?

15:03.203 --> 15:05.605
I DON'T SEE WHY
THAT'S IMPORTANT.

15:05.638 --> 15:08.541
I WAS HAVING LUNCH WITH HASKELL TODAY
AND HE SAID HE JUST FOUND OUT.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.944
AUNT MEL, HOW COULD YOU?

15:10.978 --> 15:13.580
LENNOX, I'M SO SORRY.
I DIDN'T... WAIT.

15:13.613 --> 15:17.017
- YOU'RE SPEAKING TO HASKELL AGAIN?
- YEAH.

15:17.050 --> 15:19.319
YEAH, WE SORTED STUFF
OUT A COUPLE DAYS AGO.

15:19.352 --> 15:20.887
TURNS OUT HE DOESN'T
LIKE MARISSA.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.623
SHE JUST JUMPED HIM IN THE PARKING
LOT AND WHAT WAS HE SUPPOSED TO DO?

15:23.656 --> 15:26.893
WAIT A MINUTE. DON'T
CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.428
YOU LIED TO ME.

15:28.461 --> 15:31.931
- NO, NO, NO, I THINK I'M IN THE CLEAR HERE.
- WHAT?

15:31.965 --> 15:34.301
YEAH, MY LIE WAS ONLY A LIE BECAUSE
YOU WEREN'T SPEAKING TO HASKELL.

15:34.334 --> 15:36.970
NOW THAT YOU'RE SPEAKING TO HIM
AGAIN, YOU'VE REMOVED MY LIE.

15:37.004 --> 15:40.607
SEE, MY LIE IS NOW THE TRUTH.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.609
ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING
TO YOURSELF?

15:42.642 --> 15:45.112
YES, I AM, AND I
LIKE WHAT I HEAR.

15:45.145 --> 15:48.315
- A LIE IS A LIE.
- A LIE IS BASED ON ITS CONTEXT.

15:48.348 --> 15:50.283
CLEARLY YOU'RE THE
EXPERT ON LYING.

15:50.317 --> 15:52.986
OKAY, MAYBE YOU WEREN'T LISTENING,
BUT YOU'VE REMOVED MY LIE.

15:53.020 --> 15:55.655
AND I'M PUTTING IT BACK, LIAR!

15:55.688 --> 15:58.992
( both shout )

15:59.026 --> 16:01.728
YOU COULD JUST SMELL
THE CRAZY IN HERE.

16:04.531 --> 16:06.499
GOOD TO SEE YOU BACK
IN THE GAME, LONGO.

16:06.533 --> 16:08.301
GOOD TO BE BACK, JACKSON.

16:08.335 --> 16:10.337
I RAISE $500.

16:10.370 --> 16:11.971
- CALL.
- CALL.

16:12.005 --> 16:14.107
CALL.

16:14.141 --> 16:16.976
SO WHERE'S YOUR STAKE
COME FROM THESE DAYS?

16:17.010 --> 16:18.711
I'M NOT GONNA LIE TO YOU, MAN.

16:18.745 --> 16:21.048
FROM THE KID THAT I BABYSIT.

16:21.081 --> 16:23.650
- ( laughing )
- OOH, ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN.

16:23.683 --> 16:26.986
LET'S SEE WHO AT THIS TABLE
HAS ACTUALLY GOT A PAIR.

16:27.020 --> 16:29.556
- I RAISE $1,000.
- I'M OUT.

16:29.589 --> 16:32.359
I THINK I CAN COVER YOUR $1,000.
I'M ALL-IN.

16:32.392 --> 16:34.627
WHAT'S IT GONNA BE, JOE?

16:34.661 --> 16:37.430
- THAT $6,000 CALLING YOUR NAME?
- I'M THINKING.

16:37.464 --> 16:39.566
SO YOU GOING ALL-IN OR WHAT?

16:41.201 --> 16:44.971
- YEAH, YEAH, I AM DEFINITELY GONNA...
- ( cell phone rings )

16:45.004 --> 16:47.207
I'M SORRY. WOULD YOU GUYS MIND IF
I JUST TAKE THAT FOR A MINUTE?

16:47.240 --> 16:49.709
- I'M... I'M SORRY.
- LONGO...

16:49.742 --> 16:51.644
- HELLO.
- JOE, WE'RE RUINED.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.446
YOU KNOW THOSE JUMPTECH VIDEOS
OF THOSE KIDS SLAM-DUNKING?

16:53.480 --> 16:55.382
THEY ARE ALL FAKES.

16:55.415 --> 16:57.684
WAIT A MINUTE. CALM DOWN.
WHO SAID THEY WERE FAKED?

16:57.717 --> 16:59.252
THE PRESIDENT OF THE COMPANY

16:59.286 --> 17:02.355
AS THE FBI HAULED HIM
AWAY IN HANDCUFFS.

17:02.389 --> 17:05.158
I'M OUT, GUYS. THIS
GAME'S TOO HOT FOR ME.

17:09.162 --> 17:12.432
WELL, LOOK AT US, RIGHT
OUT HERE IN THE OPEN.

17:12.465 --> 17:14.467
WHERE EVERYONE CAN SEE US.

17:14.501 --> 17:17.270
YEAH, I EVEN TOLD LENNOX
WHERE I WAS GOING.

17:17.304 --> 17:20.173
DON'T HAVE TO HIDE BEHIND
ANYONE'S BACK ANYMORE.

17:20.207 --> 17:21.474
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

17:21.508 --> 17:23.710
I MEAN, NOW WE CAN SPEND OUR
ENERGY GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

17:23.743 --> 17:26.379
REALLY TALKING INSTEAD
OF JUST PLOTTING OUT

17:26.413 --> 17:28.381
WHERE OUR NEXT SEXY
HOOKUP MIGHT BE.

17:28.415 --> 17:32.385
- YEAH, NOW THAT WAS GETTING OLD.
- UH-HUH.

17:32.419 --> 17:35.222
- UH-HUH.
- ( clears throat )

17:35.255 --> 17:36.656
- YEP.
- YEP.

17:36.689 --> 17:39.226
YEP. CONVERSATION.

17:39.259 --> 17:40.727
YOU KNOW, WE CAN...

17:40.760 --> 17:43.530
WE CAN TALK ABOUT ANYTHING.

17:43.563 --> 17:46.199
- ANYTHING IN THE WORLD.
- YEAH.

17:46.233 --> 17:48.801
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

17:48.835 --> 17:52.139
- SO WHERE'D YOU PARK?
- I GOT A METER. IT ALREADY HAD 15 MINUTES ON IT.

17:52.172 --> 17:54.207
- NICE, YEAH.
- MM-HMM.

17:55.708 --> 17:58.745
THIS IS... THIS IS GREAT.

18:06.186 --> 18:08.155
"IN AFTER-HOURS TRADING,
JUMPTECH HAS DROPPED

18:08.188 --> 18:11.158
FROM $12 A SHARE TO 8 CENTS."

18:11.191 --> 18:13.426
IT'S ALL GONE, JOE.
MY MONEY IS ALL GONE.

18:13.460 --> 18:15.595
WHAT I DID WAS DUMB.
IT WAS LIKE GAMBLING.

18:15.628 --> 18:18.665
AND GAMBLING'S
STUPID, RIGHT, JOE?

18:18.698 --> 18:22.202
YES. DEFINITELY.

18:22.235 --> 18:24.571
UNLESS YOU HAVE A SYSTEM FOR IT.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.639
RYDER, I HEARD ABOUT YOUR
STOCK ON THE WAY HOME.

18:26.673 --> 18:29.309
I WAS RICH, AND THEN
I LOST EVERYTHING.

18:29.342 --> 18:32.179
HEY, WELL, YOU CAN TAKE
A LESSON FROM JOE.

18:32.212 --> 18:35.148
I MEAN, HE BOUNCED BACK PARTLY.
I MEAN, HE...

18:35.182 --> 18:37.550
WELL, HE'S STILL BOUNCING.

18:37.584 --> 18:39.352
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, BUDDY?
IT ACTUALLY TURNS OUT

18:39.386 --> 18:41.221
THERE'S THIS HIGHLY ARCANE S.E.C.
RULE

18:41.254 --> 18:42.622
THAT CAN ACTUALLY
"UNWIND" A TRADE

18:42.655 --> 18:44.757
AND RETURN ALL THE
FUNDS TO THE INVESTOR

18:44.791 --> 18:46.693
IF IT CAN BE PROVEN
THAT THE INVESTOR

18:46.726 --> 18:49.596
WAS A NICE YOUNG MAN

18:49.629 --> 18:53.300
WHO WAS MAKING HIS
FIRST INVESTMENT.

18:53.333 --> 18:54.834
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

18:54.867 --> 18:56.836
- IS THAT TRUE?
- IS IT TRUE?

18:56.869 --> 18:59.872
WOULD JOE LIE TO YOU?

18:59.906 --> 19:02.108
WOULD I LIE TO YOU, DUDE?
COME ON.

19:02.141 --> 19:05.345
YEAH, ALL WE HAVE TO DO NOW IS
JUST FILL OUT ALL THE PAPERWORK,

19:05.378 --> 19:08.481
AND YOU'LL HAVE YOUR $1,000
BACK IN ABOUT A WEEK.

19:08.515 --> 19:12.252
FROM NOW ON, I'M ALWAYS
DOING WHAT YOU SAY.

19:12.285 --> 19:15.422
THANK YOU. YOU'RE CLEANING ALL
THE RAIN GUTTERS THIS WEEKEND.

19:15.455 --> 19:17.457
DAMN, THAT WENT BAD FAST.

19:21.294 --> 19:24.897
OKAY, CAN WE MAKE A PACT RIGHT NOW
NOT TO EVER LIE TO THE KIDS AGAIN?

19:24.931 --> 19:28.435
OKAY, BUT TECHNICALLY,
MINE WASN'T A LIE.

19:28.468 --> 19:30.403
OH, MY GOD. YOU JUST...
YOU NEVER STOP.

19:30.437 --> 19:32.239
YOU SAY THAT LIKE IT'S NEWS.

19:32.272 --> 19:34.140
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE ANYWAY?

19:34.173 --> 19:35.808
- DIDN'T YOU HAVE A BIG DATE TONIGHT?
- YEAH, IT'S FUNNY.

19:35.842 --> 19:38.278
ONCE WE COMPARED PARKING SPACES,

19:38.311 --> 19:39.746
THE NIGHT KIND OF PEAKED.

19:39.779 --> 19:42.449
I DON'T KNOW. WITHOUT SNEAKING
AROUND BEHIND PEOPLE'S BACK,

19:42.482 --> 19:45.252
THE THING WITH SAM KIND
OF LOST ITS THRILL.

19:45.285 --> 19:46.719
PRETTY MESSED UP, HUH?

19:46.753 --> 19:49.922
YOU SAY THAT LIKE IT'S NEWS.

19:49.956 --> 19:53.593
WHAT IS IT ABOUT PEOPLE ALWAYS WANTING
TO DO THINGS THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO?

19:53.626 --> 19:56.396
YOU KNOW, MEL,
IT'S HUMAN NATURE.

19:56.429 --> 20:00.166
I MEAN, PEOPLE CAN'T HELP
THEMSELVES, YOU KNOW?

20:00.199 --> 20:01.834
I MEAN, YOU START
FEELING SOMETHING

20:01.868 --> 20:05.472
THAT YOU THINK MAYBE YOU
SHOULDN'T AND THEN...

20:07.240 --> 20:09.476
THE PULL IS TOO STRONG.

20:09.509 --> 20:13.480
WELL, MAYBE THE
PULL IS TOO STRONG

20:13.513 --> 20:16.283
BECAUSE IT'S AGAINST THE RULES.

20:16.316 --> 20:19.319
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING.

20:19.352 --> 20:23.256
IF THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES
A RELATIONSHIP EXCITING

20:23.290 --> 20:24.424
IS THAT IT'S FORBIDDEN...

20:24.457 --> 20:25.825
IT'S PROBABLY NOT WORTH IT.

20:25.858 --> 20:28.461
NO, IT'S PROBABLY TOTALLY HOT.

20:31.964 --> 20:33.533
CONGRATULATIONS

20:33.566 --> 20:37.236
ON TURNING 106, MRS. McKINNON.

20:37.270 --> 20:40.773
AS YOUR CITY COUNCILWOMAN,
I, MEL BURKE,

20:40.807 --> 20:43.910
VALUE CONTACT WITH
MY CONSTITUENTS,

20:43.943 --> 20:47.847
ESPECIALLY SOMEONE WITH AS MUCH
LIFE EXPERIENCE AS YOU HAVE.

20:49.282 --> 20:51.751
( coughs ) EXCUSE ME.

20:51.784 --> 20:54.987
DO YOU HAVE A COUGH DROP OR MAYBE
A HARD CANDY IN YOUR PURSE?

20:56.523 --> 20:58.525
THANKS FOR COVERING.

21:02.329 --> 21:04.764
AND AS YOUR COUNCILWOMAN,
MEL BURKE,

21:04.797 --> 21:06.699
I THINK THERE'S SO MUCH
YOU COULD TEACH US ALL

21:06.733 --> 21:08.735
ABOUT THE REAL VALUES
IN LIFE, YOU KNOW,

21:08.768 --> 21:11.938
LIKE INTEGRITY AND HONESTY.

21:11.971 --> 21:14.374
THANK YOU, DEAR.

21:14.407 --> 21:16.409
THANKS TO BOTH OF YOU.

21:16.443 --> 21:18.545
WHAT... WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

21:18.578 --> 21:20.580
OH, DROP IT.

21:20.613 --> 21:23.350
I DIDN'T GET TO BE 106

21:23.383 --> 21:24.717
WITHOUT PAYING ATTENTION.
