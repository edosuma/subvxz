02:24.320 --> 02:27.153
That makes all my actions
when I move through the world,

02:27.240 --> 02:30.596
I do things better 'cause I can
see it all laid out like a map.

02:30.680 --> 02:31.874
Have you ever looked
at a map?

02:32.000 --> 02:34.296
Yes, if I'm not mistaken.
Do you know how to read a map?

02:34.320 --> 02:35.576
Do you know how to read a map?
Yeah.

02:35.600 --> 02:38.717
Your father's a perfectly good guy,
but it is a lot of stuff

02:38.800 --> 02:41.519
that he just doesn't understand
about the world that I understand.

02:41.640 --> 02:43.198
Listen, huh?
My dad...

02:43.280 --> 02:45.635
I haven't asked you
a question, yet.

02:45.720 --> 02:48.917
Listen. Shh, don't tell you mother.
Shut up, be quiet.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.136
Shush, be quiet.
I haven't asked you the question, yet.

02:51.160 --> 02:52.991
I haven't asked you anything.
Listen.

02:53.080 --> 02:54.832
We got it.
Don't worry about it.

02:54.920 --> 02:55.989
Listen.

02:57.840 --> 03:00.718
If there was... If you could take
one guy to an island with you

03:00.800 --> 03:02.950
and you knew you'd be safe
'cause he was the best man,

03:03.040 --> 03:04.680
he was going to figure out
how to survive,

03:04.760 --> 03:05.976
he was going
to make everything,

03:06.000 --> 03:08.056
he was going to make the world
a good place on the island,

03:08.080 --> 03:10.594
he was going
to keep you happy, he, he...

03:10.680 --> 03:12.159
This is the best man
for the job.

03:12.240 --> 03:14.595
No matter what, if it was
between me and your father,

03:14.680 --> 03:16.113
who would you take?
My daddy.

03:16.200 --> 03:18.760
I don't see...
Hang on a second.

03:18.840 --> 03:20.751
Listen, I didn't think
you're wrong about that.

03:20.840 --> 03:23.638
It's your choice to make, but I
want you to understand something.

03:23.720 --> 03:25.278
There's a lot of...

03:25.360 --> 03:27.430
Hey. What happened?
What is that?

03:27.560 --> 03:29.551
You can't leave
your fish around like that.

03:48.880 --> 03:51.474
I don't know why the hell
it keeps dripping.

03:51.560 --> 03:53.676
All night long,
drip, drip, drip.

03:53.760 --> 03:55.910
I've had the fucking thing
repaired ten times.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.752
You need
a new stopper.

03:57.880 --> 03:59.757
Is that it?

03:59.840 --> 04:04.391
Well, your stopper, it's rotted around
the edges, so it's not making a seal,

04:04.480 --> 04:07.074
The water is going to drip
through into the bowl.

04:11.400 --> 04:14.676
I could bring you
a new one tomorrow,

04:14.760 --> 04:18.435
or you might want to consider
replacing the whole apparatus.

04:18.519 --> 04:20.476
What do you recommend?

04:22.640 --> 04:24.039
I could replace
the stopper first.

04:24.120 --> 04:26.759
If that doesn't work, I could
replace the whole apparatus.

04:27.840 --> 04:30.593
You can't give me
a professional recommendation?

04:31.920 --> 04:34.480
I don't know.
It's really up to you.

04:36.280 --> 04:40.558
Tomorrow my sister-in-law's
coming over with the nephews.

04:41.960 --> 04:45.111
I got to take the car in.
Um...

04:56.400 --> 05:00.552
No, it's my sister Janine's
oldest daughter's Bat Mitzvah.

05:02.080 --> 05:04.958
I'm looking forward
to being bored to death.

05:07.080 --> 05:09.878
The girl doesn't want it,
her father doesn't want it.

05:09.960 --> 05:12.554
And don't even ask me.

05:12.640 --> 05:14.835
Seven hours in the car.

05:16.280 --> 05:18.714
I could really
slit my throat.

05:20.840 --> 05:23.752
But, oh, well,
the little girls are charming.

05:42.640 --> 05:44.790
Lee, I am so sorry.

05:44.880 --> 05:46.029
That's okay.

05:46.160 --> 05:48.674
This is so gross.
That's all right.

05:59.160 --> 06:01.116
No, tell him to come.

06:01.960 --> 06:03.359
Okay, yeah.

06:04.160 --> 06:07.994
But-But Cindy,
I have to tell you something.

06:08.080 --> 06:11.117
I'm like in love
with my janitor.

06:11.200 --> 06:13.031
Is that sick?

06:13.160 --> 06:16.994
Have you ever had a sexual
fantasy about your handyman?

06:17.080 --> 06:20.789
Well, it's awkward because he's
literally like cleaning the shit out

06:20.880 --> 06:22.916
of my toilet bowl
right now.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.878
And I don't think
I'm at my most alluring.

06:25.960 --> 06:29.669
Yeah, maybe you're right.
It's not like I met him socially.

06:29.760 --> 06:32.479
Okay, thank you, Cindy.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.551
Okay, like 20 minutes.

06:34.640 --> 06:36.232
Bye.

06:46.800 --> 06:48.153
All right, all set.

06:48.280 --> 06:50.840
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.

06:50.920 --> 06:52.638
Can I give you a tip?

06:52.720 --> 06:54.870
You mean
like a suggestion?

06:55.000 --> 06:58.993
No, I mean, like, a tip.
Oh, okay.

06:59.080 --> 07:00.877
Thank you.

07:03.200 --> 07:06.158
Yeah, good night.
Good night. Good bye.

07:19.520 --> 07:22.114
I mean, how many times do we
have to fix these fucking pipes?

07:22.200 --> 07:24.873
Every time I take a shower,
their entire apartment has a flood.

07:24.960 --> 07:27.190
It's driving me insane.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.080
Well, I'll get you a plumber
in here tomorrow,

07:29.160 --> 07:31.536
but I'd say that we're going to have to
break through the tile and isolate the leak

07:31.560 --> 07:32.936
because there's quite a lot
of water down there.

07:32.960 --> 07:35.349
How do you know it's me?
Why is it automatically me?

07:35.440 --> 07:37.635
Well, because it if was coming
from higher up,

07:37.720 --> 07:41.872
you'd have water damage in your ceiling
or in your wall, and it's all dry.

07:41.960 --> 07:43.439
Great.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.312
Well, it might just be
the caulking.

07:48.400 --> 07:49.913
This whole tub
needs to be re-caulked.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.296
Have you taken a bath or shower
in the last couple of hours?

07:52.320 --> 07:53.753
Yes.

07:54.920 --> 07:56.558
Well, it might just be that.
Okay.

07:56.640 --> 07:58.517
And how are you planning
to find that out?

07:58.600 --> 08:01.160
Well, we could run the shower
and see if it drip downstairs.

08:01.240 --> 08:03.071
Oh, you want me
to take a shower now?

08:03.160 --> 08:04.559
No.

08:04.640 --> 08:06.616
You want me to take a shower
right now while you stand there

08:06.640 --> 08:09.473
watching to see if it drips
into the Friedrich's apartment?

08:10.760 --> 08:12.910
I don't give a fuck
what you do, Mrs. Olsen.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.116
I'm just trying to fix
the fucking leak.

08:21.840 --> 08:24.070
I... I didn't like that.

08:25.080 --> 08:27.389
How dare you talk
to me like that?

08:27.480 --> 08:29.516
Get the fuck out
of my fucking house.

08:29.640 --> 08:32.313
Okay. Get the fuck out
out of my fucking house

08:32.400 --> 08:34.470
before I call the police.

08:34.600 --> 08:37.672
All right. Did you hear me?
I said get out.

08:37.760 --> 08:39.955
I can't.
You're blocking the doorway.

08:40.840 --> 08:42.831
What the fuck's
the matter with you?

08:42.919 --> 08:45.036
You can't talk
to the tenants like that.

08:45.120 --> 08:48.112
Look, Lee, you do good work.
You're dependable

08:48.200 --> 08:50.475
But I get these complaints
all the time.

08:50.560 --> 08:54.030
You're rude, you're unfriendly,
you won't say good morning.

08:54.120 --> 08:55.269
I mean, come on.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.715
Mr. Emery,
I fix the plumbing.

08:57.800 --> 08:59.791
I take out the garbage.
I paint their apartments.

08:59.880 --> 09:03.190
I do electrical work, which we
both know is against the law.

09:03.280 --> 09:06.477
I show up on time,
I'm working four buildings,

09:06.560 --> 09:08.835
and you're getting
all the money.

09:08.920 --> 09:11.309
So do whatever
you're going to do.

09:11.400 --> 09:14.472
Would you be willing
to apologize to Mrs. Olsen?

09:14.560 --> 09:16.437
For what?

09:18.400 --> 09:21.312
All right, all right,
I'll talk to her.

09:24.880 --> 09:26.056
Here you go.
Thanks.

09:26.080 --> 09:27.798
How you doing?
Good.

09:28.880 --> 09:31.599
How's things going, all right?
Yeah.

09:31.720 --> 09:34.234
You see the game?
Yeah, I did.

09:34.400 --> 09:36.152
You think they have a shot?
No.

09:36.240 --> 09:38.470
Not one.

09:38.560 --> 09:41.154
Dropped the first two, they're
going to lose the next three.

09:48.520 --> 09:50.590
Oh, my God,
I'm so sorry.

09:51.600 --> 09:52.999
That's okay.
Did I get you?

09:53.080 --> 09:54.991
Yes.
I got you.

09:55.120 --> 09:57.031
It's okay.
Let me get you some napkins.

09:57.200 --> 09:59.919
I'm okay. Hey, Lenny,
can I grab some napkins?

10:00.720 --> 10:02.517
Thanks.

10:02.600 --> 10:04.511
Thank you.
Here.

10:04.600 --> 10:06.158
Thanks.

10:14.120 --> 10:17.078
Well, now I spilled my beer
all over you, my name's Sharon.

10:19.480 --> 10:21.789
Uh, that's okay.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.552
And you are...

12:00.160 --> 12:02.310
Uh... I don't think so.

12:02.400 --> 12:03.833
No, I don't think so, either.

12:03.920 --> 12:05.399
We never met?

12:05.480 --> 12:07.436
No, not yet.
No.

12:07.520 --> 12:09.033
No.

12:09.120 --> 12:12.590
So, what the fuck
you looking at me for?

12:12.720 --> 12:15.154
Excuse me? I said what the fuck
are you looking at me for?

12:15.280 --> 12:18.317
Hey, take a fucking walk... No, no,
no, don't apologize to this asshole.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.675
We really weren't looking
at you, seriously.

12:26.680 --> 12:28.830
Let me go.
I got to go take a hike.

I want to take

Other left he went.

12:55.040 --> 12:56.473
Ten points,
San Antonio lead.

12:56.560 --> 12:58.676
Isaiah Thomas
been so good this season.

12:59.760 --> 13:01.796
Knocks down
that three pointer.

13:59.520 --> 14:01.556
Hello, this is Lee.

14:07.400 --> 14:09.550
Oh. Okay.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.517
When did that happen?

14:13.640 --> 14:15.358
Well, how's he doing now?

14:21.880 --> 14:24.599
No, don't do that.

14:24.680 --> 14:26.636
I'm going to come
up there right now.

14:28.800 --> 14:31.030
I'll be up there
in a hour and a half.

14:32.240 --> 14:33.309
Okay?

14:33.400 --> 14:35.630
Thank you.
Bye.

14:46.640 --> 14:48.915
Mr. Emery,
it's Lee again.

14:49.000 --> 14:53.312
I contacted Jose, who says he can cover
for me till Friday night at least.

14:53.400 --> 14:57.871
Uh, after that, Gene MacAdavey
will take over until I get back.

14:59.320 --> 15:01.675
I wouldn't do anything with
Mr. and Mrs. Fredrick's ceiling

15:01.760 --> 15:03.830
until you get
a real plumber in there.

15:03.920 --> 15:06.195
But what
are you going to do?

15:06.280 --> 15:09.477
I will let you know a soon
as I have more information.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.835
I should be in Manchester
a week at least.

15:11.920 --> 15:13.751
Thank you very much.
Bye.

15:31.280 --> 15:32.679
Come on.

15:35.640 --> 15:37.471
Go.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.069
Hiya, Lee.

16:32.160 --> 16:33.513
Is he dead?

16:38.000 --> 16:41.151
I'm sorry, Lee. He passed
away about an hour ago.

16:42.360 --> 16:43.759
Oh.

16:43.840 --> 16:44.875
I'm so sorry.

16:56.880 --> 16:58.518
Did you see him?

16:59.200 --> 17:02.112
No, I mean, uh...
George brought him in.

17:02.200 --> 17:06.590
We were looking at the boat this
morning, and the he just...

17:06.680 --> 17:09.147
I don't know,
he just, like, fell over.

17:09.240 --> 17:11.674
I thought he was
kidding me at first.

17:11.800 --> 17:14.916
Then I called the ambulance,
and, uh...

17:16.079 --> 17:17.798
That was it.

17:21.839 --> 17:24.593
I'll just call Dr. Muller
and tell him that you're here.

17:24.720 --> 17:28.269
Where's Dr. Betheny?
Oh, she's on maternity leave. Here he is.

17:28.400 --> 17:31.358
Lee? I'm Dr. Muller.
We spoke on the phone.

17:31.440 --> 17:32.953
Yeah. Hi.

17:33.040 --> 17:35.110
I'm very, very sorry.

17:36.440 --> 17:37.475
Thank you.

17:37.600 --> 17:39.158
Hello, George.
Hiya, Jim.

17:39.280 --> 17:41.396
How you holding up?
Oh...

17:41.480 --> 17:42.674
Great, you know.

17:42.800 --> 17:45.712
It's a very sad day.
Yeah.

17:48.720 --> 17:50.438
Where's my brother?

17:50.520 --> 17:53.159
He's downstairs.
You can see him if you want.

17:54.920 --> 17:56.399
What happened to him?

17:56.480 --> 17:58.675
Went into cardiac arrest.

17:58.760 --> 18:02.548
You know his heart was very weak at
this point, and it just gave out.

18:03.640 --> 18:06.518
I'm sorry you didn't get here in time,
but as I told you on the phone...

18:06.600 --> 18:08.556
Aw, fuck this.

18:17.960 --> 18:18.960
Sorry.

18:19.080 --> 18:21.355
That's okay, buddy.
That's perfectly all right.

18:22.280 --> 18:24.510
Did anybody call my uncle?

18:25.800 --> 18:27.631
His Uncle Donny.
Ah.

18:27.760 --> 18:30.149
Yeah, my Aunt and Uncle...
No, Lee. Lee, no.

18:30.240 --> 18:34.233
Donny got a job in Minnesota, like,
a while ago.

18:34.320 --> 18:36.311
Minnesota?

18:36.400 --> 18:40.279
He got a job in some outfit
in Minnetonka, Minnesota.

18:40.360 --> 18:41.918
If you can believe that.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.200
Joe didn't tell you
about that?

18:45.280 --> 18:47.555
No.

18:49.960 --> 18:51.473
I can call them
if you want, Lee.

18:51.560 --> 18:53.039
Tell them
what happened.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.636
Okay, thanks.
Oh, no problem.

18:57.720 --> 18:59.551
And tell him
what happened.

18:59.640 --> 19:02.200
Tell them
I'll call them tonight.

19:03.640 --> 19:05.232
Talk about arrangements.

19:05.320 --> 19:07.151
Somebody should call
my wife.

19:08.600 --> 19:09.669
Your, uh...

19:11.480 --> 19:12.595
Ex-wife.
You mean Randi?

19:12.680 --> 19:14.910
Randi. Yes, I'm sorry.
I meant Randi.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.911
I already thought of that.
I'll take care of it.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.991
Okay, thank you.
No problem.

19:19.080 --> 19:21.992
Can I see him now?
Sure.

19:22.080 --> 19:26.073
Lee, I can wait up here, Lee,
if you need anything.

19:26.160 --> 19:27.991
Okay.

19:29.080 --> 19:30.559
Thanks.

19:39.240 --> 19:42.516
Would you like a Kleenex?
Yeah. Thanks, yeah.

19:42.600 --> 19:45.194
Can I get a couple Kleenex please?
Thanks, hun.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.636
I'm sorry.
Oh, please.

20:02.200 --> 20:03.838
How is Dr. Betheny?

20:03.920 --> 20:06.434
Oh, she's doing very well.
She just had twin girls.

20:06.520 --> 20:08.636
Ah, lrene told me that.
Yeah.

20:08.720 --> 20:11.712
I'll call her this afternoon
and tell her what happened.

20:11.800 --> 20:14.109
She was very good to him.

20:14.200 --> 20:16.031
Yes, she was.

20:17.720 --> 20:20.917
The disease is commonly referred
to as congestive heart failure.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.035
Oh, my God.

20:22.160 --> 20:23.388
Are you familiar with it?
No.

20:23.480 --> 20:25.232
Then what are you saying
"Oh, my God" for?

20:25.320 --> 20:26.355
Because what is it?

20:26.440 --> 20:28.954
What she's trying
to explain, honey...

20:29.080 --> 20:30.274
I'm sorry, Dr. Beth...

20:30.400 --> 20:32.520
Betheny. Betheny, I'm sorry.
I can never get it right.

20:32.560 --> 20:33.629
Not a problem.

20:33.720 --> 20:36.314
So... you were saying.

20:36.400 --> 20:40.473
It's a gradual deterioration
of the muscles of the heart.

20:40.560 --> 20:42.596
It's usually associated
with older people,

20:42.720 --> 20:45.712
but in rare cases it will occur
in a younger person.

20:45.800 --> 20:47.836
Some people live up
to 50 or 60 years

20:47.920 --> 20:49.478
with just
an occasional attack,

20:49.600 --> 20:52.194
but most people
suffer periodic episodes,

20:52.280 --> 20:53.918
like the one
you had on Monday.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.080
Which mimic the symptoms of a heart attack
in which further weaken the muscle.

20:57.120 --> 21:00.157
They can put you out of
commission for a week, two weeks,

21:00.240 --> 21:02.736
and you'll need to be hospitalized
so that we can monitor your heart

21:02.760 --> 21:05.832
because the risk of cardiac arrest
is elevated for a week or two.

21:05.920 --> 21:07.035
Oh, my God.

21:07.160 --> 21:09.310
But in between most people
feel perfectly healthy.

21:09.400 --> 21:11.436
You can basically live
a normal life.

21:11.520 --> 21:16.036
Wait, so what do you mean
some people live to be 50, 60 years?

21:16.120 --> 21:17.553
I mean, you saying total?

21:17.640 --> 21:20.200
Or you saying when they're
diagnosed with this, or what?

21:20.280 --> 21:22.953
What are you saying?
Tell me the fucking truth.

21:23.040 --> 21:24.314
Total.

21:24.400 --> 21:27.710
For most people with the
particulars of your condition,

21:28.920 --> 21:31.992
the average life expectancy
is five to ten years.

21:39.240 --> 21:41.196
The statistics vary widely.

21:41.320 --> 21:44.392
You're not a statistic,
you're just one person.

21:44.480 --> 21:47.438
And we don't know what's
going to happen to you, yet.

21:48.480 --> 21:50.789
But it's not
a good disease.

21:53.920 --> 21:55.751
What is a good disease?

21:57.040 --> 21:58.996
Poison lvy.
Athlete's foot.

21:59.080 --> 22:00.195
It's a comedy routine.

22:00.320 --> 22:01.719
Elise, please.
For Christ's sake.

22:01.840 --> 22:03.876
Oh, my God, when am I going
to put one foot right?

22:03.960 --> 22:06.315
How about a hint?
Elise.

22:06.440 --> 22:08.158
Daddy.
What?

22:08.240 --> 22:11.391
No, she's fine.

22:11.480 --> 22:12.674
We're all upset.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.080
We're all going to listen.

22:15.120 --> 22:17.216
We're going to ask any of the
question we want to ask,

22:17.240 --> 22:19.879
and then we're going to figure
out what to do together, right?

22:19.960 --> 22:21.029
Sure.

22:21.120 --> 22:23.759
So, you were saying Dr. Beth.

22:23.840 --> 22:25.751
It's Dr. Bethany, Dad.
Try to get it right.

22:25.840 --> 22:28.308
I do not see where the humor
lies in this situation.

22:28.400 --> 22:31.039
Elise, you must calm down.
No.

22:31.160 --> 22:34.118
No, no more,
I'm not going... no.

22:34.200 --> 22:36.589
Elise, let me get you
a glass of water.

22:36.680 --> 22:38.591
Daddy, forget it.

22:38.680 --> 22:40.238
Forget it.
Forget it. Like you...

22:40.320 --> 22:42.390
Everybody should be
just like you.

22:42.480 --> 22:45.597
You know what? I'm tired
of being the bad guy here.

22:45.680 --> 22:47.238
Who's in the fucking
hospital here?

22:47.320 --> 22:49.595
Right, so I'll be
the bad guy,

22:49.720 --> 22:52.280
and you be in the hospital
and explain the jokes to your son.

22:52.360 --> 22:54.590
I'm going home.
You're going home?

22:55.680 --> 22:57.875
- You're going home?
- Yes.

22:57.960 --> 22:59.678
Let me get her back.
Fuck her.

22:59.800 --> 23:02.633
You want to stop with that shit?
Come on with that stuff.

23:26.440 --> 23:27.793
Thank you, Tony.

25:08.160 --> 25:11.789
I have to get up to Manchester.
Nobody told Patrick right?

25:11.880 --> 25:13.856
No, you had asked for us
to wait for you to get here.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.632
Yes, thank you.

25:16.840 --> 25:19.354
So, um...

25:21.360 --> 25:22.759
What is the procedure now?

25:22.840 --> 25:25.336
Well, now you have to make
arrangements with the funeral parlor,

25:25.360 --> 25:27.476
and they pretty much
take care of everything.

25:29.560 --> 25:30.680
I don't know
the name of one.

25:30.840 --> 25:33.274
That's all right. We can help
you with that. Oh, yeah.

25:34.120 --> 25:36.236
Then they'll just come
and pick him up? Yeah.

25:36.320 --> 25:37.958
I can make
those calls, Lee.

25:38.080 --> 25:40.719
Let me know if you need any help
with anything. Okay, thank you.

25:42.680 --> 25:44.352
We've got to talk
about the boat

25:44.480 --> 25:48.439
and the website
and all of that.

25:48.520 --> 25:50.078
Sure.
I'm around.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.639
I got to get up there
before school lets out so...

25:58.720 --> 26:01.314
You just have to sign
for Joe's belongings.

26:01.400 --> 26:02.799
Right this way.

26:07.240 --> 26:08.753
Just got to sign
right here.

26:15.240 --> 26:16.832
Where's Joe's belongings?

26:16.920 --> 26:19.195
The plastic bag right here.

26:21.760 --> 26:23.034
Give me a sec.

26:25.600 --> 26:27.272
Where's Joe's belongings?

26:28.360 --> 26:29.856
All right, all right,
that's good, hold.

26:29.880 --> 26:32.838
Like that?
Yeah, but keep your thumb off the line.

26:32.920 --> 26:34.896
If you get a strike,
it's going to slice it right open.

26:34.920 --> 26:36.672
You know what happens then.
What?

26:36.760 --> 26:39.797
Sharks will smell the blood
and they'll rip this boat apart.

26:39.880 --> 26:41.950
No, they won't.
Yeah, they will.

26:42.120 --> 26:43.599
Dad, will they?
Yes, sir.

26:43.680 --> 26:44.680
Shut up.

26:44.760 --> 26:47.274
You know, I've seen a school of
sharks tear a boat to pieces

26:47.360 --> 26:48.759
like it was made
of cardboard,

26:48.840 --> 26:50.831
because some kid threw a
band-aid in the water.

26:50.960 --> 26:53.428
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, he did.

26:55.120 --> 26:56.519
Oh, yeah.

26:56.600 --> 26:57.794
No, you didn't.

26:57.880 --> 26:59.518
Sometimes the only way
to keep them off

26:59.600 --> 27:02.353
is to throw the kid directly
in the ocean to distract them.

27:02.440 --> 27:05.034
Shut up. Sharks don't
even swim in schools.

27:05.120 --> 27:08.032
Huh? He says sharks
don't swim in schools.

27:08.120 --> 27:09.269
Smart kid.

27:09.360 --> 27:10.759
Yeah, he is.

27:10.840 --> 27:13.559
A really smart kid is exactly
the kind of quality meal

27:13.640 --> 27:16.552
a humongous school of sharks is looking
for when they're circling a boat.

27:16.640 --> 27:18.870
Uncle Lee,
shut up.

27:18.960 --> 27:20.576
Hey, you got a strike.
Strike, strike, strike.

27:20.600 --> 27:23.319
Ease up on the drag, ease up on your drag.
Watch your fucking thumb.

27:23.440 --> 27:25.829
Hey, you got a strike now.
Don't hit me, catch your fish.

27:25.960 --> 27:27.837
No swearing.
You got a strike.

27:27.920 --> 27:30.275
I got him, we got him.
Drive the boat, mind your business.

27:30.360 --> 27:31.918
You got to get
the hook in him.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.638
Shut up.
Mind your business.

27:33.760 --> 27:36.228
What kind of fish is it?
It's got to be a Great White.

27:36.320 --> 27:38.754
It's got to be a Great White Patty.
Maybe a barracuda.

27:38.840 --> 27:40.910
It's not a shark.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.036
Come on, pull it up.
It's not a shark.

27:43.120 --> 27:44.519
Stop talking...

28:44.320 --> 28:46.470
How come that's
connected to those?

28:46.560 --> 28:48.056
It's not, kid.
It just looks that way.

28:48.080 --> 28:49.296
I'm trying
to teach you the islands.

28:49.320 --> 28:52.676
That's the island the rich guy bought
so no one else will put a house on it.

28:52.760 --> 28:55.672
That's how rich he is.
Baker lsland, Misery lsland.

28:55.760 --> 28:58.399
Misery lsland is where me and
your aunt Randi got married.

29:06.800 --> 29:08.518
Hello?
Yeah. Hi, honey.

29:10.360 --> 29:12.555
Suzy, Daddy's home.

29:15.760 --> 29:17.637
Hi, Suzy.
Daddy's home.

29:17.760 --> 29:20.194
Hi, Daddy.
Hi, sweetheart.

29:23.720 --> 29:25.073
Hug.

29:29.720 --> 29:31.517
Oh, Jesus Christ,
you're breaking my neck.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.115
Lee?

29:35.240 --> 29:36.468
Yeah,
Hi, hon.

29:38.280 --> 29:40.032
Hey.

29:40.120 --> 29:41.314
Did you have a good time?

29:41.400 --> 29:43.152
Yeah, really good.
Where's your mother?

29:43.280 --> 29:45.589
They just left.
Oh, no.

29:45.720 --> 29:47.517
Yeah, she's sad
to miss you, too.

29:47.600 --> 29:49.716
There's always next time.
Did you get any sleep?

29:49.800 --> 29:52.553
Oh, yeah. It's all rest
when my mother's here.

29:52.640 --> 29:55.154
That's too bad.
Hi, Kary.

29:55.240 --> 29:57.037
Hi, Daddy.

29:57.120 --> 29:58.394
Dad...

29:58.480 --> 29:59.754
I'm putting you down.
Relax.

29:59.840 --> 30:01.592
I'm just giving you a kiss.

30:01.720 --> 30:03.551
Honey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, Karen. Karen.

30:03.640 --> 30:05.232
I almost dropped you
on your head.

30:06.320 --> 30:08.038
I'm making
a hair salon.

30:08.160 --> 30:10.833
Oh, yeah?
It's really good.

30:10.920 --> 30:12.638
You want to cut my hair?

30:12.720 --> 30:14.995
It's just for girls.
I'm sorry.

30:15.080 --> 30:17.355
It's all right.
I understand, sweetheart.

30:18.600 --> 30:21.398
May I watch TV
to get some ideas?

30:21.480 --> 30:22.629
- No.
- Yeah.

30:24.240 --> 30:25.639
Go ahead.

30:26.920 --> 30:28.239
Get off.

30:30.920 --> 30:32.638
How you feeling?

30:33.840 --> 30:35.990
Better.
Yeah?

30:36.080 --> 30:38.230
Yeah.
You sound better.

30:38.320 --> 30:40.709
So, did you guys actually
use the fishing tackle?

30:40.800 --> 30:42.995
Yeah, we really did.

30:43.080 --> 30:46.755
Patty got a humongous bluefish.
Eighteen pounds.

30:46.840 --> 30:48.671
Oh, yeah?
That's awesome.

30:48.760 --> 30:50.800
I never seen anybody so happy
in my whole life. Aww.

30:50.880 --> 30:51.880
It's nice in here.

30:51.960 --> 30:55.350
You keep it nice.
What a homemaker. Fuck off.

30:55.440 --> 30:56.998
All right.

30:57.080 --> 30:59.640
Get away from me.
Stop it.

31:00.800 --> 31:03.678
Mmm, don't.
Stop, please.

31:03.840 --> 31:05.432
I'm sick.

31:05.520 --> 31:06.953
Okay.

31:07.040 --> 31:08.268
For real,
get off of me.

31:13.200 --> 31:14.269
Hi, Stanny.

31:14.360 --> 31:15.998
Oh, God.
Let him alone, please.

31:16.120 --> 31:18.120
How come you're not crying?
I just got him settled.

31:18.200 --> 31:19.936
Just got him settled?
What did you get him settled for?

31:19.960 --> 31:22.440
Lee, don't pick him up. Oh, what
do you mean don't pick him up.

31:22.560 --> 31:25.518
If he's not crying, leave well enough
alone. "Leave well enough alone."

31:25.600 --> 31:28.216
That's what me and your Mummy should've
done instead of getting married.

31:28.240 --> 31:32.233
Oh, shut up. Then you wouldn't be here.
Your sisters wouldn't be here.

31:32.320 --> 31:35.676
I could watch the football game in my
own living room with peace and quiet.

31:35.760 --> 31:38.672
You know what?
You go fuck yourself.

31:38.760 --> 31:41.274
Oh, jeez, Louise.
Hey, kiddo.

31:41.360 --> 31:44.432
Oh, my God, you're very handsome,
you know that?

31:44.520 --> 31:46.431
See that?

31:46.520 --> 31:48.511
I didn't make him cry.

31:49.440 --> 31:51.749
Lay down.
Yeah.

31:52.400 --> 31:55.233
He's not crying 'cause I
know how to handle him.

31:57.760 --> 31:59.671
How is he?
How's Joe?

31:59.760 --> 32:02.638
He's fine.
You know, he's all right.

32:02.720 --> 32:04.756
He's doing all right.

32:04.840 --> 32:07.832
And you didn't run out of beer?
You got through the day okay?

32:07.920 --> 32:09.273
Oh, yeah.

32:09.360 --> 32:11.590
We were very temperate.

32:11.680 --> 32:14.558
I don't know why you guys bother
getting on the frigging boat.

32:14.640 --> 32:16.835
What do you mean?
Because we love the sea.

32:16.920 --> 32:19.434
Oh, yeah? How many beers
did you have on the sea?

32:19.560 --> 32:21.471
Eight.
Eight?

32:21.560 --> 32:24.154
Yep, eight
over a seven-hour period.

32:24.280 --> 32:27.556
Which...
Well, I am well impressed.

32:27.640 --> 32:28.789
...is...

32:32.400 --> 32:36.632
1.1428572 beers an hour.

32:36.720 --> 32:39.314
What, it's like you didn't even
have anything to drink at all.

32:39.400 --> 32:41.675
Yeah, I told you
I was cutting down.

32:45.760 --> 32:48.638
Oh, God, no. What do you
think you're going to do?

32:50.720 --> 32:53.393
I guess I'm going
to take a shower.

32:53.480 --> 32:55.232
Randi, I swear to God.

32:55.320 --> 32:57.276
You should've seen
his face.

32:59.560 --> 33:00.834
He was so happy.

33:00.920 --> 33:03.878
It was like when we took the
girls on the Merry Go Round.

33:04.840 --> 33:07.479
It was just pure happiness.

33:10.840 --> 33:11.955
Oh.

33:12.040 --> 33:14.395
Oh, come on, I'm sick.
I'm sick.

33:14.480 --> 33:16.118
I'm really...

33:16.200 --> 33:20.113
Really, babe,
deeply sick.

33:24.200 --> 33:26.191
It actually makes it
hard to breathe.

33:33.840 --> 33:35.910
He's not at school?
I thought school let out...

33:36.000 --> 33:37.176
I'm pretty sure he would have...
What?

33:37.200 --> 33:39.509
I'm sorry.
Paul, my phone is...

33:39.600 --> 33:41.318
Sorry, say that again.
That's all right.

33:41.400 --> 33:43.736
I'm pretty sure he would've left
for hockey practice by now.

33:43.760 --> 33:45.432
He's on the hockey team?

33:45.520 --> 33:47.590
Yeah, yeah.
He's doing real well, too.

33:47.680 --> 33:49.750
Hey, how's Joe doing?
He going to be okay?

33:49.880 --> 33:50.880
Yeah, he's fine.

33:50.920 --> 33:52.717
Where's the practice?
Is it at the school?

33:52.840 --> 33:54.796
No, they practice
at Gloucester.

33:54.880 --> 33:56.279
They practice
in the Gloucester...

33:56.360 --> 33:58.316
I'm sorry, it's not at the school?
No.

33:58.400 --> 34:00.470
What?
Can you hear me?

34:00.640 --> 34:02.949
The phone... That's all right.
Can you hear me?

34:03.040 --> 34:04.871
Yeah.
It's at Gloucester, okay?

34:05.000 --> 34:07.594
I understand. Yeah, we play
with the Rockport team.

34:07.720 --> 34:10.632
But they're the league team. Okay,
I understand. Thank you, Paul.

34:10.719 --> 34:12.536
Yeah, sure thing. Hey, give
Joe my regards, all right?

34:12.560 --> 34:13.594
I will.

34:13.679 --> 34:15.318
What's up?

34:15.400 --> 34:17.833
Uh, Joe Chandler's
in the hospital again.

34:17.920 --> 34:19.319
Oh, how awful.
Yeah.

34:19.440 --> 34:22.079
Who was on the phone?
That was Lee Chandler.

34:22.199 --> 34:25.192
Lee Chandler?
The very one.

34:32.560 --> 34:34.152
Hey.

34:48.760 --> 34:51.149
Hey, hey.
Knock it off.

34:51.239 --> 34:53.117
Chandler.

34:53.199 --> 34:54.428
Knock it off.

34:54.520 --> 34:55.839
One more time
and you're out.

34:55.920 --> 34:57.911
You understand that, Chandler?
One more time.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.228
Aw, fuck me.

34:59.360 --> 35:02.670
What's that?
Fuck my fucking ass.

35:02.760 --> 35:04.616
All right, you are out.
Chandler, you're benched.

35:04.640 --> 35:05.834
All right.

35:05.920 --> 35:07.672
Ask me if I give a shit.

35:08.760 --> 35:10.159
What's that?

35:12.720 --> 35:14.358
Coach, that's his uncle.

35:14.440 --> 35:15.919
His father
must be in the hospital.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.877
Whose father?
Chandler's?

35:17.960 --> 35:20.336
Yeah, he only comes around
when Mr. Chandler's in the hospital.

35:20.360 --> 35:22.874
He's got congestive heart failure.
Patrick's dad.

35:22.960 --> 35:24.439
So that's Lee Chandler?

35:25.680 --> 35:26.874
The Lee Chandler, huh?

35:26.960 --> 35:29.120
Yeah, but coach, you know
that story's bullshit, right?

35:29.160 --> 35:30.559
Total bullshit, coach.

35:30.680 --> 35:33.399
You guys want to watch
the language? Sorry.

35:40.320 --> 35:43.392
All right mind, your own business
for a little while, huh?

35:43.480 --> 35:45.869
Take a break.
Get a water.

36:21.480 --> 36:23.516
All right, show's over.

36:27.480 --> 36:29.118
Come on, let's go, let's go.

36:29.200 --> 36:30.428
You all right, brother?

36:30.520 --> 36:33.034
Take these sticks back,
would you?

36:57.400 --> 36:58.515
Line it up again.

36:58.600 --> 36:59.669
Come on, let's go.

37:13.800 --> 37:16.394
I have to go to the hospital
and sign some more papers.

37:16.480 --> 37:18.118
Do you want to see him?

37:20.200 --> 37:23.112
I don't know.
Why?

37:23.200 --> 37:24.758
What does he look like?

37:25.720 --> 37:27.358
He looks like he's dead.

37:28.240 --> 37:31.391
I mean, he doesn't look
like he's sleeping, or anything.

37:32.680 --> 37:34.591
But he doesn't look
gross, either.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.433
I don't know.

37:47.280 --> 37:49.919
Well... you don't have to.

37:53.160 --> 37:54.832
I wanted to see him.

37:54.960 --> 37:57.758
Maybe you don't want that image
in your memory. I don't...

37:59.280 --> 38:00.633
It's up to you.

38:12.840 --> 38:15.195
What do you want to do?

38:15.280 --> 38:16.679
Want me to take you home?

38:20.200 --> 38:22.077
You want me
to decide for you?

38:25.640 --> 38:26.868
Let's just go.

38:28.440 --> 38:30.680
What the fuck are you doing?
I just said let's go inside.

38:30.720 --> 38:32.936
No, you just said, "Let's just go",
and then you get out of the car...

38:32.960 --> 38:35.474
Okay, I meant let's go inside.
What's your problem?

38:35.600 --> 38:39.673
My problem is I could've ripped your fucking leg off.
Okay, I'm sorry I misused the English language.

38:46.640 --> 38:48.119
I'm sorry, Uncle Lee.

38:48.200 --> 38:50.316
I'm sorry, too.
I just got scared.

38:55.680 --> 38:57.352
Yep. Okay.
Thank you.

38:58.880 --> 39:00.598
Of course.

39:21.320 --> 39:23.754
You got to hit
the bleeper.

39:23.880 --> 39:25.871
I don't have a bleeper.

39:26.680 --> 39:28.511
I'll do it.
There's a code.

39:44.040 --> 39:46.679
Hey, is it okay if I invite
some of my friends over?

39:46.760 --> 39:48.352
I told them
I would call them.

39:48.480 --> 39:51.995
Go ahead. And can we get some pizza?
There's nothing to eat here.

39:52.080 --> 39:53.399
Okay.

39:55.160 --> 39:56.479
What kind would you like?

39:56.560 --> 39:58.790
Any kind is fine.
Thank you.

40:13.080 --> 40:14.638
At least he didn't suffer.

40:14.720 --> 40:17.234
It's worse for the family,
but it's better for the person.

40:17.320 --> 40:19.696
Well, he was a fucking great guy,
Patrick, I'll tell you that.

40:19.720 --> 40:21.517
That's for sure.

40:21.600 --> 40:24.034
You know, I remember
this one time he...

40:25.760 --> 40:27.800
He took us all out in the
boat, like in sixth grade.

40:27.880 --> 40:28.915
Yeah, I remember that.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.592
And he made us wear
life preservers.

40:30.680 --> 40:33.399
And I was like, you know,
"What's the difference, Mr. Chandler?

40:33.480 --> 40:35.520
The boat sinks in this weather,
we're dead anyways."

40:35.560 --> 40:37.360
Yeah, I remember that.
And then he was like...

40:37.440 --> 40:40.193
"The life jacket's to make it easier
on the sharks when you go over."

40:40.280 --> 40:42.191
Fucking smart ass,
I swear to God.

40:42.280 --> 40:44.635
Yeah, he really liked
those shark jokes.

40:44.720 --> 40:46.551
He was funny, man.

40:46.640 --> 40:50.599
Yeah. He was gentle,
too, you know?

40:50.680 --> 40:52.955
Like his son.

41:00.360 --> 41:02.316
There's this former
starship captain, all right?

41:02.480 --> 41:04.994
This former starship captain...
With the Star Trek again?

41:05.120 --> 41:07.793
Will you shut the fuck up?
Fuck you. Star Trek sucks.

41:07.880 --> 41:09.313
You fucking retard.

41:09.400 --> 41:12.312
Star Trek is one of the classical
pillars of modern entertainment.

41:12.400 --> 41:14.709
Tell me about Star Trek,
enlighten me, motherfucker.

41:14.800 --> 41:16.496
I'll tell you this. How long
have I been friends with you?

41:16.520 --> 41:18.476
How you doing, baby?
I'm okay.

41:18.760 --> 41:20.296
Enough is enough, okay?
It just started.

41:20.320 --> 41:22.117
How dare you?
Will you shut up?

41:22.240 --> 41:26.358
Fuck Star Trek. Every sci-fi classic
film you like is based on Star Trek.

41:26.480 --> 41:28.471
Star Trek is bullshit.
Star Trek is retarded.

41:28.560 --> 41:30.516
Then Road Warrior,
Then the Matrix.

41:30.600 --> 41:31.715
Retarded as shit.

41:33.360 --> 41:35.920
I love Star Trek, all right?
How dare you.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.309
Ask Patrick.
He loves them.

41:38.400 --> 41:40.136
Patrick, what do you think
about Star Trek? Ask Patrick.

41:40.160 --> 41:42.833
I can't believe we're talking
about Star Trek right now.

41:47.160 --> 41:48.718
I like Star Trek.

41:48.800 --> 41:50.074
Thank you.

41:51.680 --> 41:53.796
Hey, Uncle Lee.

41:53.880 --> 41:57.429
Is it okay if Silvie sleeps over?
Dad always let her.

41:57.520 --> 41:59.670
Then what
are you asking me for?

42:01.320 --> 42:02.639
No reason.

42:03.680 --> 42:05.033
Thanks.

42:08.960 --> 42:10.678
Uh, not that it would
come up or anything,

42:10.760 --> 42:14.196
but her parents think she stays
downstairs when she stays over.

42:14.280 --> 42:18.159
If it comes up for some reason, can you
just say she stayed in the downstairs room?

42:22.560 --> 42:25.279
I don't even know them.
Yeah, you do.

42:25.360 --> 42:27.920
It's the McGanns.
Frank and Pat McGann.

42:28.040 --> 42:29.758
Oh, that's Silvie McGann?
Yeah.

42:32.040 --> 42:33.439
Okay.
So...

42:34.920 --> 42:36.638
Do you mind saying
she stayed downstairs?

42:36.760 --> 42:39.399
Like, if they call
or something? Okay.

42:50.120 --> 42:52.156
Am I supposed to tell you
to use a condom?

42:52.240 --> 42:54.151
No, I...

42:55.360 --> 42:57.476
Is that what Joe would say?

42:57.560 --> 42:59.312
No.
I mean, yeah.

42:59.400 --> 43:02.233
Yeah, we've had
"the discussion" and everything.

43:03.120 --> 43:04.155
So...
Okay, good.

43:04.240 --> 43:06.629
Yeah, just let me know
if we're making too much noise.

43:08.640 --> 43:09.959
Okay.

43:21.960 --> 43:22.960
Uh...

43:24.200 --> 43:27.272
Do you think I should call my
mom to tell her about Dad?

43:30.000 --> 43:31.638
No, I wouldn't, Patty.

43:31.760 --> 43:35.958
Yeah. I mean, uh, nobody
even knows where she is.

43:36.040 --> 43:37.109
Yeah.

43:37.200 --> 43:39.953
Yeah, yeah, I know. I was just
curious what you thought.

43:42.040 --> 43:45.350
Anyway...
Good night, Uncle Lee.

43:45.440 --> 43:46.953
Good night.

43:58.280 --> 43:59.952
Shut up.

44:03.640 --> 44:06.871
Hey, shut up, shut up.
Hey, Elise.

44:08.240 --> 44:09.389
Shit.

44:09.480 --> 44:10.879
Hey.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.069
Come on.

44:12.160 --> 44:15.152
Lee, you want to take Patty
upstairs and get him washed up?

44:17.480 --> 44:18.799
Come on, kid.
Go on now.

44:18.880 --> 44:20.996
Everything will be all right.
I'll be up in a minute.

44:21.080 --> 44:23.435
Go on upstairs, Patty.
Everything will be okay.

44:23.520 --> 44:25.909
I thought it was wonderful
that you dropped that ball.

44:32.080 --> 44:33.832
Oh, shit.

44:33.920 --> 44:35.319
Go on.

44:51.280 --> 44:52.838
Shut the fuck up.

45:30.400 --> 45:33.472
Beverly, Massachusetts.
Gallagher Funeral Home please.

45:34.400 --> 45:35.549
Morning.

45:35.640 --> 45:37.198
Hi.

45:42.280 --> 45:43.872
Yes, hi, my name
is Lee Chandler.

45:43.960 --> 45:48.158
My brother Joseph Chandler is
at the Beverly Hospital morgue.

45:48.240 --> 45:52.233
I'm wondering who I need to talk
to about making arrangements.

45:55.760 --> 45:57.034
Yeah, thank you.

46:04.360 --> 46:06.078
Yes.

46:06.200 --> 46:08.475
Yes, I just spoke...

46:08.560 --> 46:10.790
Yes, my name
is Lee Chandler.

46:10.880 --> 46:13.633
My brother's
at the Beverly Hospital morgue.

46:14.560 --> 46:15.675
Yes.

46:18.960 --> 46:20.075
Okay.

46:21.120 --> 46:22.792
I understand.
I'm...

46:24.600 --> 46:27.558
I'm calling to find out exactly what
I need to do to make arrangements

46:27.680 --> 46:28.954
for the next step.

46:34.080 --> 46:36.036
I see.
Okay, thank you.

46:39.000 --> 46:40.797
Can I have a napkin?
Yes.

46:42.200 --> 46:45.192
That's right. But what do you
I got to do to get his...

46:45.320 --> 46:47.276
To get his body over to...

46:47.360 --> 46:50.352
Excuse me, Mr. Chandler. I don't think
Patrick needs to be here for this.

46:50.440 --> 46:52.749
No, I'm all right.

46:52.840 --> 46:53.875
I don't understand.

46:53.960 --> 46:57.316
So why is it more to drive
his body to Manchester?

46:57.400 --> 47:00.392
You going to take the highway for seven
minutes, that's why it costs more?

47:00.480 --> 47:03.119
What does it cost
if the hearse takes 127?

47:03.200 --> 47:04.997
Jesus.
Like, that's his focus?

47:05.080 --> 47:07.230
He's all right.

47:11.520 --> 47:13.511
Thanks, Uncle Lee.
You're welcome.

47:14.480 --> 47:16.550
Thanks, Mr. Chandler.
You're welcome.

47:33.000 --> 47:34.194
So...

47:35.360 --> 47:37.078
We're going to forget
about the language.

47:38.360 --> 47:40.954
We're going to forget
about the fists.

47:41.040 --> 47:44.271
But I want you take
a few days off of practice.

47:44.360 --> 47:46.715
I don't want you
on the ice.

47:46.840 --> 47:48.751
Well, to tell you
the honest truth, sir,

47:48.840 --> 47:50.398
I could really use
the distraction.

47:50.480 --> 47:53.040
The ice is not
a distraction.

47:54.320 --> 47:56.675
When you're on the ice,
you got to be there.

47:58.440 --> 48:01.079
Okay, so take a couple
days off and we'll talk.

48:03.040 --> 48:05.190
Listen,

48:05.280 --> 48:09.239
when I was your age,
I lost my dad, too.

48:09.320 --> 48:10.389
So...

48:12.080 --> 48:14.389
I know what
you're going through.

48:15.880 --> 48:17.154
If you want
to come in and talk,

48:17.240 --> 48:21.153
or you want somebody
to spill your guts to,

48:21.240 --> 48:23.276
or throw the bull around,

48:23.360 --> 48:25.351
the door's open.

48:34.960 --> 48:37.554
You mind if I put
some music on? No.

48:44.240 --> 48:45.958
You like these guys?

48:47.760 --> 48:51.116
The lead guitar is weak, but
otherwise they're pretty good.

48:51.240 --> 48:54.437
I don't know, they all
sound the same to me.

49:00.280 --> 49:01.633
Where we going?

49:01.720 --> 49:03.517
Got to go to the lawyer.

49:03.600 --> 49:05.192
What for?

49:05.280 --> 49:07.236
Read your father's will.

49:08.120 --> 49:09.792
Do I have to be there?

49:09.880 --> 49:12.633
I don't think so, but I think
you're supposed to be.

49:14.560 --> 49:16.755
Who do you think
he left the boat to?

49:16.840 --> 49:18.796
I'm sure
he left you everything.

49:26.440 --> 49:28.476
I don't understand.

49:30.520 --> 49:33.159
Which... part are you
having trouble with?

49:33.280 --> 49:34.872
Well, I can't be
his guardian.

49:38.960 --> 49:40.313
Well...

49:41.680 --> 49:44.148
Uh...
I mean I can't.

49:46.320 --> 49:49.869
Well, naturally I assumed that Joe
had discussed all this with you.

49:49.960 --> 49:51.188
No.

49:52.600 --> 49:53.999
He didn't.

49:55.040 --> 49:56.393
No.

49:59.160 --> 50:00.593
I-I...

50:00.680 --> 50:02.591
Sorry, I have to say
I'm somewhat taken aback.

50:02.680 --> 50:04.750
He can't live with me.
I live in one room.

50:04.840 --> 50:07.070
Well, but Joe has provided
for Patrick's upkeep.

50:07.160 --> 50:10.869
Food, cloths, etcetera. And the house
and the boat are owned outright.

50:10.960 --> 50:13.554
I can't commute from Boston
every day until he turns 18.

50:14.800 --> 50:16.870
I think the idea
was that you would relocate.

50:17.000 --> 50:20.197
Relocate to where?
Here? Well, if you look...

50:20.280 --> 50:23.909
As you can see, your brother worked
everything out extremely carefully.

50:24.040 --> 50:26.873
But he can't...
He can't have meant that.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.309
Uh, he's allowed
up to $5,000...

50:29.400 --> 50:30.879
to pay
for moving expenses.

50:30.960 --> 50:35.954
And there's a small amount
set aside for you to draw from

50:36.040 --> 50:39.191
as personal income
while you settle in.

50:39.280 --> 50:42.158
I mean, assuming
that you accept.

50:42.240 --> 50:44.117
What about my Uncle Donny
and Aunt Teresa?

50:44.200 --> 50:47.795
Joe didn't feel that Patrick really had
any special relationship or feeling.

50:47.880 --> 50:49.393
I don't understand.

50:49.480 --> 50:52.597
Now, as I think you know, they've
moved out to Wisconsin, I believe.

50:52.720 --> 50:54.438
Minnesota.
Minnesota

50:54.560 --> 50:57.393
Minnetonka, Minnesota.
That's right.

51:15.440 --> 51:19.558
It was my impression that you'd spent
a lot of time here over the years.

51:19.680 --> 51:21.636
I was just a backup.

51:21.720 --> 51:24.598
I came up here to look after Patty,
yeah, if Joe was in the hospital

51:24.680 --> 51:26.671
after my father
couldn't do it. We...

51:26.760 --> 51:28.830
It was supposed
to be Donny.

51:30.600 --> 51:32.158
I'm just a backup.

51:35.960 --> 51:39.509
Well, I can just repeat
that I'm astonished

51:39.600 --> 51:42.239
that Joe didn't run this by you,
thorough as he was.

51:42.320 --> 51:44.834
Yeah, because he knew what I would
say if he would have asked.

52:02.960 --> 52:04.109
Hey.

52:05.320 --> 52:07.151
You want to keep it down,
you fucking morons?

52:07.240 --> 52:09.310
My kids are sleeping.

52:10.520 --> 52:13.432
I am so sorry.
I mean...

52:13.520 --> 52:17.229
Lee, you want to get these fucking
pinheads out of my house please?

52:18.960 --> 52:22.077
Yeah, I do.
I mean, I really do.

52:26.280 --> 52:27.952
She can't talk
to us that way.

52:28.080 --> 52:29.399
Yeah.

52:33.720 --> 52:35.517
Hey.

52:35.640 --> 52:37.551
I'm not fucking around.

52:37.640 --> 52:39.232
It's 2:00
in the fucking morning.

52:39.320 --> 52:42.040
Get these fucking assholes dressed
and get them the fuck out of here.

52:48.680 --> 52:50.238
We're dressed.

52:50.320 --> 52:53.039
She didn't mean it.
She'll apologize later.

53:00.560 --> 53:02.073
They're already left.

53:03.720 --> 53:04.789
Lee...

53:08.000 --> 53:11.310
Thanks for hosting, kid.
Tell Randi we're sorry.

53:11.400 --> 53:13.834
- Drink and drive.
- We're so sorry.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.798
You see Jupiter?
Keep you eyes on the road.

53:19.680 --> 53:21.671
Hey, Tommy.

53:21.800 --> 53:23.518
Goodnight, Joe.

53:23.600 --> 53:25.795
Sorry again.

53:26.960 --> 53:29.349
Go ahead.
Shoot for it, you fucking idiot.

53:29.440 --> 53:31.271
Look, there's the North Star
right there.

53:31.360 --> 53:33.191
Right there.

53:34.160 --> 53:35.354
It's due north.

53:49.800 --> 53:51.791
I'll clean up
in the morning.

53:51.880 --> 53:54.075
Did you see Jupiter,
you fucking asshole?

53:54.160 --> 53:56.196
Come on.

53:57.400 --> 53:59.834
Fuck you.
Come on.

54:03.000 --> 54:04.000
Lee...

54:14.080 --> 54:17.516
Lee, nobody can appreciate
what you've been through.

54:17.600 --> 54:18.669
If I can say that.

54:32.480 --> 54:36.314
And if you really feel
like you can't take this on,

54:36.400 --> 54:40.518
well, that's,
that's your right.

54:40.600 --> 54:42.272
So who would get him?

54:46.600 --> 54:49.353
Patrick, can I get you
a can of soda or anything?

54:49.440 --> 54:50.839
No, thank you.

54:53.040 --> 54:55.395
Well, I don't know what's
happening with Patrick's mother.

54:55.560 --> 54:57.118
No. I'm not sure
where she is.

54:57.240 --> 54:59.310
What kind condition she's in.
No.

55:11.000 --> 55:12.433
We can't do that.

55:47.320 --> 55:49.515
Oh, God!

55:50.680 --> 55:54.116
My kids are in there!
My kids are in there!

55:54.200 --> 55:55.349
Oh, God!

58:58.880 --> 59:00.871
Look, Lee...

59:00.960 --> 59:02.393
why don't you just...

59:02.480 --> 59:05.631
Thank you, Wes.
I'll be in touch.

59:05.720 --> 59:07.233
I'm-I'm here.

59:43.200 --> 59:46.272
We were partying pretty hard.

59:46.360 --> 59:48.112
There was beer.

59:48.200 --> 59:52.796
And someone was passing around
a joint and there was cocaine.

59:52.880 --> 59:55.519
Cocaine?
Yes.

59:55.600 --> 59:57.352
Okay, go ahead.

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:04.913
Uh, anyway, our bedroom
is in the downstairs,

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.355
and the kids
sleep upstairs,

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:10.432
so Randi makes
everyone leave

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:12.511
around 2:00...

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:14.431
or three AM.

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:16.351
And then...

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.791
she goes back to bed.

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:24.474
So, I go upstairs
to check on the kids,

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:26.915
and it's fucking freezing
up stairs,

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.470
but I can't use the central heat
because it dries out Randi's sinuses,

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:32.471
and she gives her
really bad headaches.

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:36.348
So I go downstairs
and put a fire in the fireplace,

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:39.989
and I sit down to watch TV,
but there's no more beer.

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:45.558
I'm still jumping around
like a jackrabbit.

01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:49.713
So I put a couple fire
logs in the fire and I...

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:54.634
Just to warm up the house
when I was gone.

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:03.439
And then... I am going
to the mini-mart,

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:05.954
but I'm too wasted
and I don't want to drive.

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:10.078
So I walk. It's about
20 minutes each way.

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:12.751
And about halfway there,

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:17.072
and I can't remember if I put
the screen on the fireplace.

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:27.032
I figure it's okay.

01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:33.990
So I just keep going
to the store.

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:41.310
And, uh, that's it.

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:46.317
Log must've rolled out
onto the floor.

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:51.393
And the firemen said
they pulled Randi out.

01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:54.278
She was passed out
downstairs.

01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:55.998
And...

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:02.955
Then the furnace blew, and they
couldn't go back in again.

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:08.033
And that's all
I remember.

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:16.151
Okay, Lee.
That's all for now.

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:20.153
We'll call you if anything else
comes up we want to ask you about.

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:22.276
Assuming the forensics
bail you out,

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:25.636
which I'm assuming
they will...

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:30.028
So what?
That's it?

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:32.156
Look, Lee, you made
a horrible mistake.

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:34.913
Like a million
other people did last night.

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:38.314
Not going
to crucify you.

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:43.036
It's not a crime to forget to put
the screen on the fireplace.

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:47.671
So I can go?

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:51.992
Unless something else comes up we
don't know about already, yeah.

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:56.320
You got anyone to give you
a ride back home?

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:58.834
Is Joe here,
is your dad here?

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:01.714
Yeah.

01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:05.953
Okay.

01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:42.673
Please.

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:07.193
All right, let's go.

01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:11.712
Bye.

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:13.496
Where are we going,
the orphanage?

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:15.636
Shut up.
What the hell did I do?

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:17.199
Just be quiet.

01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:26.559
All right.
We got a lot to do.

01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:28.536
What about the boat?
We got to talk to George about it.

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:31.136
There's no use hanging onto it if no one's
going to use it. I'm going to use it.

01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:33.913
It's got to be maintained.
I'm maintaining it.

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:37.077
You can't maintain it by yourself.
Why not? It's my boat now, isn't it?

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:39.880
Because you're a minor. You can't
take it out alone. I'm the trustee.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:42.110
So what does "trustee" mean?

01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:44.873
I'm in charge of handling everything
for you until you turn 18.

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:46.976
Does that mean you're allowed to
sell it if I don't want you to?

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.594
I don't know.
But I'd definitely consider it.

01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:51.636
No fucking way.

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:53.199
Don't be
so goddamn sure of yourself.

01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:55.456
There's nobody to run it. You're 16
years old. I get my license this year.

01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:56.616
Doesn't matter.
You're still a minor.

01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:59.336
You can't run a commercial vessel by
yourself. It's a big fucking expense.

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:01.576
I'm the one who's going to manage
it, and I'm not going to be here.

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:03.376
Who gives a fuck where you are?
Patty, I swear to God,

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:04.776
I'm going to knock
your fucking block off.

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:07.030
Great parenting. What?
What did you say?

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:08.639
I said great parenting.
Fuck you.

01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:10.915
Mind your fucking business,
fucking asshole.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.833
Hey, hey, hey.
It's okay, it's okay.

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:16.309
I'm going to smash your fucking
face, you fucking asshole.

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:18.789
It's okay, it's okay.
Thank you, thank you. It's okay.

01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:22.230
Uncle Lee, are you fundamentally unsound?
Fucking asshole.

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:24.311
Get in the fucking car.

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:29.216
I can't obey your orders
until you unlock the door.

01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:31.071
Shut up.

01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:49.035
It's not like the
motor's going to die tomorrow,

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:51.839
but Joe said it keeps breaking
down like a son of a bitch.

01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:53.194
Yeah, but we...

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:55.669
We were going to take a
look at it this weekend.

01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:57.557
Things are
a little bit up in the air.

01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:00.433
No, I can take care of it as far as
general maintenance is concerned.

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:02.216
But that motor's going
to go at some point.

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:05.038
I'm taking care of it. There's
no allotment for a new motor.

01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:07.200
Unless, George, you know
someone who wants to buy it.

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:10.518
Wait a second.
I'm not selling it.

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:12.352
We're going to be
in Boston anyway.

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:15.193
What? Since when are we
supposed to be in Boston?

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:17.555
Just take it easy.
Well, whatever you decide,

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:19.835
it's going to bleed you dry
just sitting here.

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:21.319
We don't know exactly
we're doing.

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:25.234
Well, you know, he can always stay with
us if he wants to come up weekends.

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:27.311
Do you want to be
his guardian?

01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:32.392
Well... He doesn't want
to be my guardian.

01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:35.313
We're trying to lose
some kids at this point.

01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:37.560
We're just working out logistics.
That's pretty good.

01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:40.513
Jesus Christ, you want to stop?
We've always got a sofa for him.

01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:42.656
You know that, right? George,
that's all right. I know that.

01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:46.798
He's welcome any time.
I know. Thank you.

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:52.835
Are you brain-damaged?
You can't just talk to people that.

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:55.016
You don't want to be my
guardian, that's fine with me.

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:56.758
It's not that.
It's just the logistics.

01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:59.070
I just got to work it
all out, I swear. How?

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:01.400
By sending me to Wonkatonka,
Minnesota with Uncle Donny?

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:04.750
Minnetonka, Minnesota. Okay, Minnetonka,
Minnesota. Same difference.

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:09.758
What about my mother?

01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:13.472
The judge would never
let that happen.

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:16.910
And anyway, no one knows
where she is. I do.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.151
She's in Connecticut.
At least she was last year.

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:23.477
Since when do you know that?
Well, she emailed me last year.

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:26.034
So I emailed her back.
You know, email?

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:28.833
Did your father know you were in
touch with her? Are you kidding?

01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:32.792
Could we walk?
I'm freezing.

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:42.552
All I know is...
I know, I know, I know.

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:45.393
She's a drunk, she's insane,
she let the dogs shit on the floor.

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:47.869
It's the last thing your father
ever would've wanted.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.275
Suddenly you care
what he would've wanted?

01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:53.753
Where to now?

01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:56.718
The funeral parlor.
Great.

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:05.389
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are we going?

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:07.639
It's in Beverly.

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:10.433
There's no funeral homes
in Manchester? No.

01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:15.436
The cemetery's here.

01:08:25.439 --> 01:08:27.112
Let's just get this done.

01:08:56.120 --> 01:09:01.433
Dude, what is with that guy and
the big Serious and Somber Act?

01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:04.154
I don't know.

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:07.915
But seriously, does he not realize that
people know he does this every single day?

01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:10.720
I don't know.

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:13.437
Why can't we bury him?

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:15.078
It's too cold.

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:17.296
The ground is too hard.
They'll bury him in the Spring.

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:18.992
So what do they do
with him until then?

01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:20.908
They put him in a freezer.

01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:24.950
Are you serious?

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:26.393
Yes.

01:09:28.479 --> 01:09:30.152
That really freaks me out.

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:32.356
It doesn't matter.

01:09:33.319 --> 01:09:34.594
Wait a minute.

01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:40.908
I think I parked the car
the other way. Sorry.

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:47.200
What about one of those
mini-steam shovels?

01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:51.551
What? I once saw one of those
mini-steam shovels one time

01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:53.153
in a graveyard
in New Haven.

01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:55.470
It dug a perfect little hole
in about two seconds.

01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:58.400
I don't really know how
you would get a hold of one.

01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:00.997
Or how much
it would cost.

01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:02.911
Why can't we just look
into it?

01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:06.990
Because you can't use heavy equipment
in the historic Rosedale Cemetery.

01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:08.229
Why not?

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:11.920
Because there are very important
people who are buried there,

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.629
and their descendants don't want steam
shovels vibrating over their dead bodies.

01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:17.995
Why can't we just bury him
someplace else?

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:20.275
'Cause that's the plot
that Joe bought.

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:23.631
Don't ask me why, but if you want
make some other arrangements,

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:25.216
you want to find
someplace else to bury him,

01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:26.376
you want to talk
to the mortician,

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:28.616
and you want to call up Sacred
Heart and talk to Father Martin

01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:31.376
and then find out how much that's going
to cost and make all those arrangements,

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:33.216
be my guest, otherwise,
let's just leave it, okay?

01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:35.629
I'm just saying I don't like
him being in a freezer.

01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:37.392
Yeah.

01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:41.833
I don't like it, either,
but it isn't him 'cause he's gone.

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:43.831
It's just his body.

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:45.751
I'm just saying
it kind of freaks me out.

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:49.389
Oh, goddammit,
where did I park the car?

01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:52.870
Yeah, I don't know, but I wish you'd figure
it out 'cause I'm freezing my ass off.

01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:55.911
You don't have
a normal winter coat?

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.149
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.

01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:00.674
Why don't you wear gloves
with real fingers on them?

01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:07.836
Oh, God, fuck. Oh, fuck, where'd
I park this motherfucking car?

01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:15.719
Damn, it's cold.

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:17.456
Why? What's the matter
with your winter jacket?

01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:19.311
Seriously, Patty?
Just turn the heat on.

01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:21.556
It's on already.
Turn it up a little.

01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:23.536
It's all the way up. It's blowing
fucking freezing air on me.

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:26.677
It takes a minute to warm up. What
year did you get this thing, 1928?

01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:29.456
Where's the horse that goes with this
fucking car? Maybe he can breathe on us.

01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:31.038
I swear to God...
I know.

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:33.296
Why don't we keep my dad in
here for the next three months?

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:36.240
You'd save a fucking fortune. Will you
shut the fuck up about the freezer?

01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:37.616
You want me to have
a nervous breakdown

01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:39.536
because there's undertakers and a funeral?
Who cares?

01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:41.152
No, I don't.

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:48.835
Okay, It's getting warmer.
I got band practice.

01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:52.320
Can you drive me home so I can get my stuff
and take me over to my girlfriend's house?

01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:56.039
Sure.

01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:12.136
Is this is the same girl
who was over at the house?

01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:14.958
No, that was Silvie,
and this is Sandy.

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:16.480
And they don't know
about each other,

01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:19.358
so, uh, please don't say
anything in case it comes up.

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:22.313
I won't.

01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:25.829
Do you actually have sex
with these girls?

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:28.480
Well, we don't just play
computer games.

01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:30.835
With both of them?

01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:36.438
Well, with Sandy's mom here, it's sort of
uh, strictly just like basement business.

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:38.875
What does that mean?

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.991
It means
I'm working on it.

01:13:57.720 --> 01:13:59.312
What did I do?

01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:01.675
You're way behind, man.
No, I'm not.

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:03.478
You're a little behind.

01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:05.471
You got to stay
with the bass.

01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:07.869
Come on, man. Just stay with
me, all right? Let's go.

01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:09.712
All right. I'm sorry.
Yeah, come on.

01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:11.512
Come on, let's go.

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:13.158
All right, guys,
let's go again.

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:15.510
Otto, are you good?
Are you good, buddy?

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:17.431
We are Stentorian.

01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:19.760

01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:49.076
I'm Jill, Sandy's mom.

01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:50.513
I think they're wrapping up.

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:53.478
Do you want to come inside
and have a beer or something?

01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:56.434
No.

01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:59.478
That's all right.
Thank you.

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:04.269
I wanted to offer my
condolences about Joe.

01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:07.238
He was a terrific guy.

01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:11.154
There's not too many like him.
He was a wonderful father.

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:12.912
Thank you.

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:18.513
I was... I was going to ask Patrick
if he wants to stay for supper,

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:20.750
if that's okay with you.

01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:23.400
You want to join us?
I made way too much.

01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:24.833
Oh.

01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:26.795
Uh...

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:38.235
That's all right. I'll just
come back and get him.

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:40.550
What time
should I come back?

01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:43.994
Oh, I don't know.
Nine, nine thirty.

01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:46.753
They're going to do their
homework together. Supposedly.

01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:48.478
Ha, ha, ha.

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:52.950
All right.
I'll come back at 9:30.

01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:56.112
Okay. Well, you change your
mind in the next ten minutes,

01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:57.474
we're right inside.

01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:58.879
Okay, thanks.

01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:35.676
Jesus Christ.
How do you unbuckle this?

01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:37.352
I'm scraping the skin
off my knuckles.

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:38.998
Just take your hand out.

01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:41.115
Ow.

01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:43.256
Would you please just take
your hand out of my cunt?

01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:44.679
Okay, okay.

01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:50.278
Oh, we're taking
our pants off?

01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:53.033
I'm taking my pants off.
I don't know what you're doing.

01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:54.752
I'm taking my pants off.

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:01.874
Come on.

01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:05.439
You got to take your shoe off first.
Jesus.

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:07.112
I'm trying.

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:09.998
Hey, kids?
Come on, have some dinner.

01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:14.320
Thanks, mom. We'll be right down.
Thanks, Jill.

01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:17.034
One second.
I just got to log off.

01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:18.997
Would you shut up?
She's not retarded.

01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:21.634
Why are you picking on me?
I'm not picking on you.

01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:24.228
You'll get me in trouble.
I'm not going to get in trouble.

01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:26.788
What are you trying to do?

01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:30.038
How's the math homework?

01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:32.475
It's good.
Very frustrating.

01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:33.788
Good.

01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:35.711
Yeah, those algorithms
are a bitch.

01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:40.993
This is really good, Jill.

01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:42.559
Thank you, Patrick.

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:44.517
This is a homemade
Cabonara sauce?

01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:46.398
Jesus.
Shut up. No.

01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:48.277
You could've fooled me.

01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:49.759
Jesus.

01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:52.075
What? What?
You're such a kiss ass.

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:53.160
Sandy.

01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:55.555
Because I appreciate
your mother's cooking?

01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:03.398
Good night.
Good night.

01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:09.816
Aren't you going to ask what happened?
I don't want to know.

01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:11.319
I guess not.

01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:19.189
Come on.

01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:22.238
Begeron closes, dinks and scores.

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:25.757
Alex Dean.

01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:34.235
- Hello?
- Hello, Lee?

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:36.470
It's Randi.

01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:41.634
Hello? Yeah, sorry, I'm here.
Hi, how are you?

01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:43.910
I'm okay.
How are you? Good.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.116
I was just calling...

01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:49.152
George told me about Joe. I just
wanted to call and say I'm sorry.

01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:50.753
I hope
you don't mind me calling.

01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:53.308
No, it's fine. Thank you, I don't mind.
How are you?

01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:56.789
Not so good right now.

01:18:56.880 --> 01:18:59.997
I guess we should've seen it coming,
but it's still hard to believe.

01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:01.308
Yeah.

01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:03.550
How's Patrick doing?
He's good.

01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:06.558
Beyond the obvious, obviously.
He's okay, he's fine.

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:08.576
I mean, I don't know, you know
how kids are. It's hard to tell.

01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:10.875
He doesn't really open up
with me, but he seems fine.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.150
He's got a lot of friends, so.
Well, that's good.

01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:14.719
Good, yeah.

01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:17.519
So, I don't know
if you planned a service, yet,

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:19.416
but I was also going to ask
you if you wouldn't mind,

01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:22.477
I'd like to be there,
if it's okay with you.

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:25.876
Yeah, it's fine. I don't mind.
Okay, thank you.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.230
It would mean a lot to me.
You should come.

01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:30.436
I'll let you know
when it's going to be.

01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:32.112
Thank you.

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:35.118
So, can I ask...

01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:37.999
How are you?

01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:41.271
I don't know.
How are you?

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:43.351
I don't know.

01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:45.556
We're doing pretty well.

01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:50.760
I should probably tell you.
I'm going to be...

01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:52.831
Actually, I'm pregnant.

01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:56.279
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:58.555
You know,
like ready to pop.

01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:02.958
Oh, I didn't know that.

01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:06.710
I didn't know
if I should tell you, but...

01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:10.789
No, it's fine. Congratulations.
Thank you.

01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:13.713
You would probably deduce it
for yourself when you see me.

01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:15.313
Yeah.

01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:20.030
So I, you know, I just
wanted to say, you know...

01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:22.395
Actually, um, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to cut you off.

01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:23.913
I've just got to go...

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.976
I just wanted to make sure it's okay
if me and Josh come to the funeral.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.992
It's totally okay.
Thank you, Lee.

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:31.315
God bless.
Bye. So long.

01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:35.914
So, how you holding up?

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.797
What's the matter?
No.

01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:40.269
I said how you holding up?
It's a stupid question.

01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:41.873
You get some food?

01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:43.837
Oh, I had some cheese.

01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:46.832
You had some cheese?
Asshole.

01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:48.616
I'll get you something.
I don't want anything.

01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:50.835
Hey, Janine.
Sure? Sure.

01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:52.751
Never mind.
What?

01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:53.840
Forget it.
Skip it.

01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:57.356
I can't hear a goddamn
word you're saying. What?

01:24:57.440 --> 01:24:59.670
Did Lee get food?
He didn't... What?

01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:01.830
Did Lee get food?
No.

01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:03.956
He doesn't want any.
We're good.

01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:05.519
Forget it.
He doesn't...

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:07.670
We're fine.
He doesn't want any.

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:12.231
Hey, is it okay
if I invite Silvie over?

01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:17.153
Uh, which one is she?

01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:21.318
She's the one
with the, uh, the brown hair.

01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:24.029
No.

01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:26.236
What do you mean, no?

01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:29.039
I don't like her. I don't want
her in the house right now.

01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:31.714
Why not? You don't even
have to talk to her.

01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:33.279
Sorry.

01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:35.874
Go to her house.
Call one of your friends.

01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:39.193
That's it.

01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:49.119
Would it be cool with your mom
if I came over there?

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:54.951
I have no idea.

01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:59.158
Okay.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:01.390
Well, I can't stay there, either.

01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:03.873
Sorry about that.

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:13.114
You going to stay in here?
Yeah, why not?

01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:16.949
I thought maybe you'd want
to stay in Dad's room. Hm?

01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:19.833
Why? You want me to?
No, it's just a better room.

01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:21.876
And he's not using it.

01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:24.793
Okay.
I'll stay in there.

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:26.916
We're not going to be here
that much longer anyway.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.230
I'm not moving
to Boston, Uncle Lee.

01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:31.390
Well, I don't want to talk
about that right now.

01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:34.592
You said he left you money so you could
move. Yeah, but that doesn't mean...

01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:37.433
Anyway, what's in Boston?
You're a janitor.

01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:39.351
So what?
You could do that anywhere.

01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:41.880
There's plenty of toilets and
clogged-up drains all over town.

01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:43.816
I don't want to talk about it.
All my friends are here.

01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:45.956
I'm on the hockey team.
I'm on the basketball team.

01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:49.953
I got to maintain our boat now.
I work on George's boat two days a week.

01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:52.713
I got two girlfriends,
and I'm in a band.

01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:57.559
You're a janitor in Quincy. What the
hell do you care where you live?

01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:06.716
I got to go to sleep.
Good night.

01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:37.078
Where are you going
to stay tonight?

01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:38.593
I don't know.
A motel.

01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:40.716
What time
you going to call me?

01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:42.233
When I get to the motel.

01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:44.760
If I don't hear from you by 9:00,
I'm going to call the cops.

01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:47.109
You understand?
Yes, yes.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.070
Patrick, come say goodbye
to your Uncle Lee.

01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:58.077
That's okay. No, it's not.
Patrick.

01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:00.071
Coming.

01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:17.798
I'm going to see him.

01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:38.676
Bye, Uncle Lee.
So long.

01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:28.429
Patty? I think there's
something wrong with me.

01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:30.431
What do you mean, like what?
Are you sick?

01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:32.715
I don't know.

01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:36.193
I feel really weird.
I'm sick.

01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:38.788
I'm having a panic attack.
What do you mean?

01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:40.552
Hey.
I don't know.

01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:42.915
Can you get that shit
out of here please?

01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:45.190
Get rid of what?
I don't know. I don't know.

01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:47.271
The food?
I feel really weird.

01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:48.879
You want me
to get rid of the food?

01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:51.269
I don't know.
Patrick.

01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:54.073
Hey, do you want me to take you
to the hospital? I don't know.

01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:56.056
Do you want me to call your friends?
I don't know.

01:29:56.080 --> 01:29:57.957
What do you want me to do?
I don't know.

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:02.988
Patty,
are you going to bed?

01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:04.354
Leave me alone.

01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:07.040
I don't think I should let you
keep the door shut. Just go away.

01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:08.997
I will.
Just open up the door.

01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:10.115
Fuck you.

01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:13.816
Jesus Christ. What's your problem?
I said open the door.

01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:16.056
Are you having a breakdown?
Should we take you to the hospital?

01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:18.833
No, no.
I'm just freaking out.

01:30:18.920 --> 01:30:22.754
Okay, fine. But I can't let you
freak out with the door closed.

01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:27.160
And if you're going to freak out every
time that you see a frozen chicken,

01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:28.576
I think we should go
to the hospital.

01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:29.919
I don't know
anything about this.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:34.959
I just don't like him
being in the freezer.

01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:37.474
You've expressed that
very clearly.

01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:40.080
I don't like it, either. But there's
nothing we can do about it.

01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:47.360
I'm not going to bother you. I'm going
to just sit here until you calm down.

01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:01.628
All right, I'm calmer now.
Would you please just go away?

01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:03.119
No.

01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:26.313
Cool.

01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:32.358
How much
are they paying you?

01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:35.232
Minimum wage
plus the room.

01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:42.193
All right.

01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:44.753
Let's go get
some furniture.

01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:46.637
I got furniture.

01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:49.480
No, you don't.

01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:52.909
This doesn't count
as furniture.

01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:55.991
This is not a room.

01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:00.720
Let's go get some furniture.
Get off my back.

01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:05.719
Patty.

01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:07.119
Come on, let's go.

01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:13.319
Let's go.

01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:29.478
There you go.

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:34.074
All right.

01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:36.390
Better?

01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:37.754
Better.

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:46.913
So listen.

01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:53.519
You can stay here
until your school lets out.

01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:59.073
That'll give me some time to set
things up in Boston better.

01:32:59.160 --> 01:33:01.720
Maybe you can do some stuff for
George in the summer if you want.

01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:04.194
And you don't get jerked out
of your life overnight.

01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:07.159
Okay?

01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:09.390
Are you asking
me or telling me?

01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:14.680
I'm telling you that's the best I can do. What
do you care whether it's okay with me or not?

01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:20.117
It's 45 minutes away. You can
come back here any time you want.

01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:21.719
It's an hour and a...
Is that a joke?

01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:23.576
It's an hour and a half at least.
No, it's not.

01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:25.352
An hour 15,
depending on traffic.

01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:28.776
You couldn't get from here to Quincy in half
an hour if you flew in a fucking spaceship.

01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:30.233
Okay, fuck it.

01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:39.511
I need lunch money.

01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:41.830
Hey, Patrick.
Hey, Patrick. Patrick.

01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:44.873
So, are you going
to Godspell?

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.673
I'm thinking about it.
All right. Goodbye.

01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:51.190
Are those
your girlfriends, too?

01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:52.838
They wish.

01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:56.960
Doesn't George give you money
for working on his boat?

01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:58.792
Yeah, but I'm saving that.
For what?

01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:00.154
New motor.

01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:02.833
Are you going
to Godspell?

01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:48.239
Oh, come on.

01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:53.630
Oh, come on.

01:35:56.200 --> 01:35:57.269
Hello?

01:35:57.360 --> 01:35:59.237
Hello, Lee?

01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:02.152
Lee?

01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:05.148
Lee, is that you?

01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:07.310
Hello?

01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:17.113
What happened
to your hand?

01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:18.519
I cut it.

01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:21.034
Oh, for a minute there
I didn't know what happened.

01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:34.238
Is there some reason why you didn't
tell me my mom tried to call me?

01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:45.113
She wrote me
you hung up on her.

01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:48.473
She's in Essex.

01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:51.950
She wants me to come have
lunch and meet her fiancé.

01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:57.679
What did you think? She
couldn't get in touch with me?

01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:03.109
I hung up on her because I
didn't know what to say to her.

01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:05.680
And I didn't tell you because I
didn't know what to say to you.

01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:07.159
I'm sorry.

01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:09.310
You can't stop me
talking to her.

01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:11.436
I don't give a shit
what you do.

01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:15.040
No, but you won't let
my girlfriend stay over.

01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:17.588
You hate my mother so much you
won't even tell me she called.

01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:19.591
You'd rather drag me
to Quincy and ruin my life

01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:21.352
and let somebody else
be my guardian.

01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:24.318
There is nobody else.
I can live in Essex with my Mom.

01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:28.713
No, you can't.
She's not an alcoholic anymore.

01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:31.256
She wants me to stay with her,
then that solves all our problems.

01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:35.592
I can take the same bus to my same school
and keep all my friends and the boat,

01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:39.309
and you can go back to Boston and still
check in on me or whatever, if you want to.

01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:41.749
I can't do that.
Why not?

01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:44.638
Patty, I'm sorry
I hung up on her.

01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:47.199
I'll call her back.

01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:48.633
If she seems
semi-human to me,

01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:50.656
you can go and have lunch
with her and her fiancé.

01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:53.353
That's it. I don't want to
talk about this anymore.

01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:08.031
Okay, soon as we clear, open it
up and we'll see what we can do.

01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:09.439
Okay.

01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:23.357
Oh.
Lee?

01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:24.555
Hey.
Hey.

01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:25.640
What do you say?

01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:27.472
How are you?
Yeah, good. How are you?

01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:29.073
All right.
Yeah.

01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:32.237
I'm really sorry to hear about Joe.
Yeah, thanks.

01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:33.992
How's Patrick doing?
Good.

01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:36.310
Yeah? Good.
What's going on?

01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:39.000
You know, I'm back, I'm thinking
about staying through the summer.

01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:41.674
I was wondering if you had any work.
I could pick up some hours.

01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:42.760
Sure, sure.

01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:44.916
Walter's down in Boston, so...
Oh, he is?

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:46.736
Yeah, he should be back tomorrow
if you want to come by.

01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:48.776
He's coming back up tomorrow?
Yeah, give him a call.

01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:51.155
Well, I will give him a call, yeah.
That's a good idea.

01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:52.992
Absolutely.
Okay, all right.

01:38:53.080 --> 01:38:54.672
Hey.
Yeah, all right.

01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:56.637
Good to see you.
Thanks, Jerry.

01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:07.637
I don't want to see him
in here again.

01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:08.718
So long, Patrick.

01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:16.557
How's the motor?

01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:19.916
George says the piston's going to go
right through the block any minute now.

01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:23.270
Unfortunately,
that's a problem.

01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:26.350
We can't afford to keep
the boat if we can't run it,

01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:28.280
and we can't run it
if it's got a broken motor.

01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:29.713
Let's take out a loan.

01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:31.313
And pay it back with what?

01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:34.233
We hire it out till we pay
the loan back, obviously.

01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:40.715
Unfortunately for you, I'm in charge
of your finances until you turn 21,

01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:44.110
and I'm not comfortable taking out
enormous loans on your behalf.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.434
I have band practice. Can you
drive me home to get my stuff,

01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:51.199
and then drive me over
to Sandy's house?

01:40:58.200 --> 01:40:59.792
Sure.

01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:04.096
Why don't you take
a Drivers' Ed course?

01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:06.953
Dad made me promise
not to drive till I was 17.

01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:09.275
Okay, we'll stick
with that then.

01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:18.990
Do you want
to stay for dinner?

01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:20.638
I think Sandy's mother
likes you.

01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:21.909
No, she doesn't.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.150
I happen to know
that she does.

01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:29.390
This could be good
for both of us.

01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:35.589
I'd really rather not.

01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:37.591
Well...

01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:40.776
can you at least just hang out
with her for half an hour

01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:44.315
so I can be alone with Sandy without her
mother knocking on the door every 20 seconds?

01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:45.515
Come on, man.

01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:47.192
All you got to do
is talk to her.

01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:48.896
Why can't you help me out
a little bit for once

01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:52.196
instead of dragging me to the lawyers
and the funeral parlor and the morgue?

01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:54.032
Anyway, she's really nice.

01:41:56.920 --> 01:41:58.876
♪ Tell me why ♪

01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:02.111
♪ Why ♪

01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:07.670
♪ Why do you need me ♪
♪ Why do you want me ♪

01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:10.433
Stop, stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop.

01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:12.232
Otto. What?
I'm too slow?

01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:14.157
Too fast, man.
You're dragging.

01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:16.271
You're way too fast, man.
I'm too fast.

01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:18.936
Dude, you're like pulling out of
the fucking station ahead of me.

01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:20.757
Oh, my god, you guys.
Leave him alone.

01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:23.758
I'm like, are you serious about this
band, or what? Okay, all right.

01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:26.035
Just lay off him.
Get off my back.

01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:27.752
All right,
everybody just chill here.

01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:30.308
Let's just, um,
let's just go again.

01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:35.158
We are Stentorian.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.833
Patrick is one
of my favorite people.

01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:51.273
That's good.

01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:58.633
How's it going
up there, you guys?

01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:05.957
It's going fine.

01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:07.917
We're right in the middle
of something.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.912
We're just banging
out those compound fractions.

01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:14.511
At least we know
where they are, right?

01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:17.673
That's true.

01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:25.191
How many of those do you generally got
to go through before you pick a winner?

01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:28.716
I'd like to see you use one of these goddamn
things with all these interruptions.

01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:31.869
Oh, fuck. What happened?
Are you okay?

01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:34.155
I tripped over
your fucking doll house.

01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:35.958
Oh, my God,
did you break it?

01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:37.951
I don't know. I'm fine though,
by the way.

01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:40.759
Oh, my God. My grandmother gave me
that when I was five years old.

01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:42.976
It was literally her doll house
from when she was a little girl.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:44.479
What's it doing
on the fucking floor?

01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:46.790
It's a doll house.
That's where you play with it.

01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:48.518
Sandy, what is
going on up there?

01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:51.592
Nothing. Patrick just stubbed
his toe on Mummer's doll house.

01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:52.954
But it's okay.

01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:54.672
That doll house
belonged to my mother.

01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:56.320
If you're going
to smash it to pieces...

01:43:56.400 --> 01:43:59.119
Nobody is smashing it to pieces.
Don't worry Jill, I'm okay.

01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:01.031
My toe's going to be okay.

01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:06.993
Do you want to fuck me or not?
Yes.

01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:14.669
Could I get you
another beer, Lee?

01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:16.318
I'm good.

01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:18.118
Thank you.

01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:24.029
Would you excuse me, Lee,
one sec?

01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:25.314
Sure.

01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:32.513
Is it on?
Yes. It's a miracle.

01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:34.113
Okay, hurry up.

01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:40.470
One second please.
Get out of the way.

01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:42.437
I'm sorry.

01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:57.234
What's up?
I'm really sorry.

01:44:57.320 --> 01:44:59.356
I know
you're trying to work,

01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:01.550
but I can't sit down there
much longer.

01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:03.830
Why? What's the problem?
He won't talk.

01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:06.150
I've been trying to make
conversation for half an hour.

01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:10.393
I realize I'm not the most fascinating
person in the world, Oh, Mum.

01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:12.277
But it's very, very strained.

01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:14.789
What's going on?
She can't get your uncle to talk.

01:45:15.800 --> 01:45:16.949
He likes sports.

01:45:17.080 --> 01:45:20.629
I'm sorry to bust things up, but how much
longer do you think you're going to be?

01:45:20.760 --> 01:45:22.910
Could you maybe turn on a game?
I'm sorry.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.355
Shut up
Mommy, please.

01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:27.237
You were
a tremendous help.

01:45:27.360 --> 01:45:29.416
I didn't ask to sit down there.
You can't make small talk?

01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:30.816
Like every other
grown up in the world?

01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:32.960
You can't talk about boring
bullshit for half an hour?

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:34.496
No. Hey, how about
those interest rates?

01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:37.876
I lost my Triple A card. Like
everybody else? No, sorry.

01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:44.190
You're a fucking asshole.

01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:05.397
Where did you say she lives? 'Cause
there are no houses there. None.

01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:07.280
What, does she live
in a fucking sleeping bag?

01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:08.435
119 Pigeon Hill Street.

01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:10.994
Pigeon Hill Street or Pigeon Hill Road?
Pigeon Hill Street.

01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:14.470
Pigeon Hill Street,
Pigeon Hill Court, Pigeon Hill Road.

01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:16.118
Street.
Pigeon Hill Street.

01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:17.719
This is Pigeon Hill Road.
Okay.

01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:20.536
You have no GPS whatsoever? No, I've
got a little fucking cartoon movie.

01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:23.120
You want me to punch it in for you?
No, I don't, I've got.

01:46:24.040 --> 01:46:25.792
Thank you.

01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:29.997
Okay, listen.

01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:31.712
Are you nervous?
Yeah, I'm nervous.

01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:35.469
What, are you a fucking genius?
Okay, skip it.

01:46:37.240 --> 01:46:39.674
I just want you to text me
if anything gets weird.

01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:42.550
Okay.
Thank you.

01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:00.678
Oh, my gosh.

01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:02.432
Is that my Patrick?

01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:03.834
Hi, Mom.

01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:06.875
Oh.
I'm so happy.

01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:10.672
Come in.

01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:12.557
Welcome to my home.

01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:18.189
Patrick, this is my fella.

01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:20.191
Jeffrey, this is Patrick.

01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:21.679
Great to finally
meet you, Patrick.

01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:23.193
Nice to meet you.
Yeah.

01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:27.194
And this is Lee.
Hey.

01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:28.508
Welcome.

01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:31.512
Jeffrey.
Lee.

01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:37.199
Now, Lee, you sure
you can't stay for lunch?

01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:39.555
Uh, I'm positive.

01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:46.154
Thanks.

01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:50.513
Come.

01:47:56.480 --> 01:47:58.550
Uh, are you sure
I can't help with...

01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:00.392
No, thanks, honey.

01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:02.516
Your job is to relax.

01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:05.194
That is your number one
assignment, okay?

01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:08.636
Okay, all right. I'm really
going to apply myself.

01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:10.551
Oh, I was just joking.

01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:13.039
I know you were.
So was l.

01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:21.356
How we getting along?

01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:23.078
Great.
Great.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:25.877
You don't have to be
so polite, you know.

01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:27.757
I'm not being polite.

01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:35.594
Did you want to wash
your hands before we eat?

01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:37.159
Yes.

01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:44.593
For what we are about
to receive, let us give thanks.

01:48:44.680 --> 01:48:46.511
Amen.
Amen.

01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:51.470
You can say amen, Patrick.
Nobody's trying to recruit you.

01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:54.319
I did say amen.
Oh, you did? Okay.

01:48:54.440 --> 01:48:57.955
You don't have to. Yeah, I know.
I just said it really quietly.

01:48:58.040 --> 01:49:00.031
Oh, it's fine.

01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:02.918
Honey, look, I know I'm
going to be a shock to you

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:04.638
in a lot of ways.

01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:06.199
I'm hoping
it's a good shock.

01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:08.032
Yeah.

01:49:08.120 --> 01:49:09.553
You need
anything else, Patrick?

01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:10.914
I hope everything's okay.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:12.797
Oh, yeah,
everything's great.

01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:14.757
You don't have
to be so formal.

01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:16.193
I'm not.

01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:18.197
I think your mother
wants you to feel that...

01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:22.950
I'm just saying that
this is your home, too.

01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:24.519
I want it to be.

01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:27.194
And... I know,

01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:30.875
I know, uh, things
are different for you and...

01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:34.594
I don't know.
That's okay.

01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:42.277
What are you studying
in school, Patrick?

01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:45.750
Oh, well,
the usual stuff.

01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:48.830
You know what?
I'm going to be right back

01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:50.876
Does anybody need anything
from the kitchen?

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.116
No, thanks.
I'm good, no.

01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:04.558
Did you get
some string beans?

01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:07.557
Oh, no, not yet.
Thank you.

01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:09.879
Uh, let me um...

01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:13.271
Let me just see
what she's doing in there.

01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:29.798
So, what was she like?

01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:33.870
I don't know.
She was pretty nervous.

01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:35.632
Yeah?

01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:38.552
What was that guy like?

01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:40.870
He was very Christian.

01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:45.991
Uh, you know,
we're Christian, too, right?

01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:47.798
Yes, I know that.

01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:50.075
You are aware
that Catholics are Christians?

01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:52.230
Yes, I'm aware of that.

01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:58.154
Well, sounds like
she's doing better anyway.

01:50:58.240 --> 01:51:00.708
She's not drinking.

01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:03.035
She's not
in the psych ward.

01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:06.919
Wow.

01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:09.393
Wow what?

01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:11.913
You'll do anything
to get rid of me.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.116
What?
You heard me.

01:51:15.880 --> 01:51:17.598
That's not true.

01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:32.110
Dear Patrick, I'm
writing to thank you for today.

01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:33.952
Your visit meant the world
to your mom.

01:51:34.080 --> 01:51:36.833
We are both deeply grateful for the
love and trust that you've shown

01:51:36.960 --> 01:51:38.951
by offering to rejoin her life.

01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:40.496
But I feel it would be
unfair to your mom

01:51:40.520 --> 01:51:43.318
to rush her along the long
and challenging road ahead,

01:51:43.400 --> 01:51:46.198
and so I'm going to ask you
to write to me in future

01:51:46.280 --> 01:51:48.714
to arrange
any further visits.

01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:50.631
I hope you won't take
this as an intrusion...

01:52:15.080 --> 01:52:16.479
Where's your friends tonight?

01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:17.675
I don't know.

01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:21.958
Why don't you call
that girl Sandy,

01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:23.991
and see if she'll come over?
No, thanks.

01:52:24.920 --> 01:52:26.592
Nice try, though.

01:52:49.720 --> 01:52:51.551
Who are you going to shoot?
You or me?

01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:55.635
Do you know what these
things are worth? No.

01:52:57.840 --> 01:53:00.400
Want to try and sell them so you
can get a motor for the boat?

01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:05.955

01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:27.229
could we talk
for a second?

01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:28.639
Sure.

01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:29.720
Okay.

01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:31.456
I'll just pull around.
Just be a few minutes.

Yeah, you, too.

01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:51.029
I don't have anything big to say.
That's okay.

01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:53.229
Just...

01:55:54.800 --> 01:55:56.870
I know you been around,
and I thought...

01:55:56.960 --> 01:55:58.996
Just been getting Patrick
settled in.

01:55:59.080 --> 01:56:01.275
It seems like
he's doing pretty good.

01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:02.713
Considering.

01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:04.597
I think he is.
Yeah.

01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:09.108
I guess
you don't know this, but l...

01:56:10.280 --> 01:56:11.520
I really kept in touch
with Joe.

01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:14.176
I knew that. It's been kind of
weird for me not seeing Patrick...

01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:16.031
Okay.
I didn't know.

01:56:17.800 --> 01:56:19.392
You can see him
if you want.

01:56:19.480 --> 01:56:21.391
Could we ever have lunch?

01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:24.959
You mean us?
You and me?

01:56:25.080 --> 01:56:26.149
Yeah.

01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:28.348
Um...

01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:30.032
Because I, uh...

01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:39.436
I said a lot
of terrible things to you.

01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:40.520
No.

01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:43.994
But l... I know you never...

01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:49.317
Maybe you don't want
to talk to me.

01:56:49.400 --> 01:56:51.436
It's not that.
Let me finish.

01:56:53.360 --> 01:56:54.509
However...

01:56:56.800 --> 01:56:58.631
my heart was broken.

01:57:01.480 --> 01:57:03.675
'Cause it's always
going to be broken.

01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:08.434
And I know yours
is broken, too.

01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:12.557
But I don't have
to carry...

01:57:14.440 --> 01:57:16.078
I said things that...

01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:20.400
I should fucking burn in hell
for what I said to you.

01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:22.238
No, no, no, no.
It was just...

01:57:22.360 --> 01:57:24.555
Randi, no.
I'm just sorry.

01:57:24.680 --> 01:57:26.591
I-I-I can't,
I can't...

01:57:26.680 --> 01:57:28.159
Lee, I love you.

01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:33.315
Maybe I shouldn't say that.
You can say that.

01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:34.440
I just...

01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:38.033
I'm sorry. I've got to go.
We couldn't have lunch?

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:40.752
I'm really sorry.
I don't think so.

01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:43.560
I thank you for saying everything
that you said. You can't just die.

01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:47.394
I'm not, I'm not,
and I'm not, and I'm...

01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:49.351
Honey...
I want you to be happy.

01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:51.795
Honey, I see you
walking around here...

01:57:51.880 --> 01:57:53.438
and I just want
to tell you...

01:57:53.560 --> 01:57:55.056
I would want to talk
to you, Randi... But Lee...

01:57:55.080 --> 01:57:57.753
Please, I-I-I...

01:57:57.920 --> 01:58:01.390
Lee, Lee,
you got to... I'm-I'm...

01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:04.074
I don't know what...

01:58:04.200 --> 01:58:06.839
I don't want to torture you.
You're not torturing me.

01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:10.435
I just want to tell you
that I was wrong.

01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:12.391
No, no.

01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:16.069
You don't understand.
There's nothing there.

01:58:16.200 --> 01:58:18.395
There's nothing there.
That's not true.

01:58:18.520 --> 01:58:21.034
That's not true. There's nothing there.
You don't understand.

01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:22.576
I don't know what to say.
I can understand.

01:58:22.600 --> 01:58:24.795
I know you understand.

01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:27.917
I've got to go.
Sorry.

01:58:34.040 --> 01:58:35.553
I'm sorry.

01:58:53.640 --> 01:58:55.551
Sorry, buddy.
That's all right.

01:59:05.640 --> 01:59:07.816

Break it up, break it up.

01:59:07.840 --> 01:59:09.592
Break it up.
Break it up.

01:59:09.680 --> 01:59:12.240
Get off him.
Break it up. Break it up.

01:59:12.320 --> 01:59:14.038
Break it up.
Break it up.

01:59:14.160 --> 01:59:16.469
Break it up.
Get him out of here, George.

01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:19.233
He's Joey Chandler's brother.
Back off, back off.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:22.228
Break it up.

01:59:24.840 --> 01:59:26.751
Settle down.
Settle down.

01:59:26.840 --> 01:59:28.671
Fuck that, motherfucker.
Settle down.

01:59:28.760 --> 01:59:31.274
Settle down, all right?
Are we cool?

01:59:31.360 --> 01:59:33.555
Fuck you.
Fuck him.

01:59:37.680 --> 01:59:39.671
Get off.
You'll fucking kill him.

01:59:41.480 --> 01:59:42.913
Should he go
to the hospital?

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:44.831
I don't think so.
Nothing's broken.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.116
What did they fucking
hit him with, a baseball bat?

01:59:48.240 --> 01:59:49.992
They all just said
he started swinging.

01:59:50.080 --> 01:59:51.399
Where's Patrick?

01:59:51.480 --> 01:59:53.436
He's with the kids.
I sent them out for burgers.

01:59:53.520 --> 01:59:55.556
No, no, no, no.
Lee, sit down.

01:59:55.640 --> 01:59:57.437
Sit down,
it's all right.

01:59:59.520 --> 02:00:01.320
Let me give you some money.
No, Lee, I got it.

02:00:01.440 --> 02:00:03.400
I'll give you some money.
Put that away. I got it.

02:00:03.440 --> 02:00:05.112
No, I got it.
Put your money away.

02:00:06.120 --> 02:00:07.917
I got it.
It's on me.

02:00:26.080 --> 02:00:28.719
Let me give you some coffee.
Drink this.

02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:33.518
Come on.
Come on, buddy.

02:02:24.840 --> 02:02:27.195
Can I get you anything,
Uncle Lee?

02:02:28.360 --> 02:02:30.351
Oh, no, thanks, buddy.

02:02:32.320 --> 02:02:34.197
All right.
I'm going to go to bed.

02:02:36.920 --> 02:02:38.353
Good night, kiddo.

02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:50.599
Thomas.

02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:53.513
Drives to the basket, gets two.
That's what you want.

02:02:57.200 --> 02:02:58.838
Daddy?

02:02:58.920 --> 02:03:00.956
Daddy?

02:03:07.560 --> 02:03:08.993
Yes, honey.

02:03:09.080 --> 02:03:11.913
Can't you see
we're burning?

02:03:14.880 --> 02:03:18.509
No, honey.
You're not burning.

02:03:36.760 --> 02:03:39.069
Uncle Lee,
what is that smell?

02:03:39.160 --> 02:03:41.594
I just burnt the sauce.
Everything's okay.

02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:30.199
Yeah.

02:04:32.600 --> 02:04:35.512
I got a job in Boston.
Starts in July.

02:04:38.800 --> 02:04:40.392
What is it?

02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:43.552
Custodian.
Handy man.

02:04:43.640 --> 02:04:46.757
But it's just two buildings
this time, so...

02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:52.678
And what uh, delightful Boston neighborhood
have you selected for us to live in?

02:04:53.560 --> 02:04:54.959
None.

02:04:55.080 --> 02:04:57.435
What do you mean?
You don't have to move to Boston.

02:04:59.160 --> 02:05:01.230
I'm going to be
in Charlestown.

02:05:01.320 --> 02:05:03.231
And George
is going to take you.

02:05:06.360 --> 02:05:07.998
What?

02:05:09.800 --> 02:05:11.597
I talked to him
last week.

02:05:11.680 --> 02:05:14.513
I explained
the situation to them.

02:05:14.600 --> 02:05:17.910
Georgie Junior's going to BU in the
fall, and Jimmy graduates next year.

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:21.276
We can rent this house out
until you turn 18,

02:05:21.360 --> 02:05:23.430
and then you can come back
and stay if you want.

02:05:23.520 --> 02:05:26.592
When you turn 21, you're
allowed to sell it or keep it,

02:05:26.680 --> 02:05:28.398
or whatever
you want to do.

02:05:28.480 --> 02:05:32.473
We definitely have to hire out
the boat when the summer's over.

02:05:33.920 --> 02:05:36.354
Just like we talked about.

02:05:36.440 --> 02:05:38.829
And when you get
your license, we can...

02:05:39.880 --> 02:05:42.189
We can just figure that out
when it happens.

02:05:43.440 --> 02:05:45.431
I'm still the trustee,

02:05:45.520 --> 02:05:47.590
and all the financial stuff
that Joe set up for me

02:05:47.680 --> 02:05:49.875
is going to get transferred
over to George.

02:05:49.960 --> 02:05:53.077
Basically everything is staying the same,
except you don't have to move.

02:05:57.560 --> 02:06:01.712
And, but who's... Are they going
to be my guardians, or...

02:06:01.800 --> 02:06:03.358
They're going to adopt you.

02:06:09.520 --> 02:06:12.557
Anyway, that's just how
I set it up.

02:06:14.080 --> 02:06:16.116
You don't have to.
It's up to you.

02:06:18.560 --> 02:06:21.836
So you're just going to disappear?
No.

02:06:21.920 --> 02:06:24.275
No.

02:06:24.360 --> 02:06:26.794
I set it up this way
so you could stay here.

02:06:28.400 --> 02:06:29.800
And they're really glad
to have you.

02:06:29.880 --> 02:06:32.269
I know, I know.
I mean, they're great, but...

02:06:36.240 --> 02:06:38.834
Why can't you stay?

02:06:38.920 --> 02:06:40.512
Come on, Patty.

02:06:50.680 --> 02:06:52.750
I can't beat it.

02:06:58.240 --> 02:07:00.117
I can't beat it.

02:07:01.200 --> 02:07:02.599
I'm sorry.

02:08:01.520 --> 02:08:02.919
What do you think?

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.070
I think it'll be okay.

02:08:05.160 --> 02:08:07.390
Are you one
of Stan Chandler's boys?

02:08:07.480 --> 02:08:08.879
Yeah, I'm Lee.

02:08:08.960 --> 02:08:11.918
I used to play chess with
your father a long time ago.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.070
He was a excellent
chess player.

02:08:14.160 --> 02:08:15.354
That's him.

02:08:15.440 --> 02:08:17.192
He's not still living, is he?

02:08:17.280 --> 02:08:18.759
No.

02:08:18.840 --> 02:08:21.752
One of the sons passed away recently,
I heard.

02:08:21.880 --> 02:08:23.711
Uh, yeah, my brother Joe.

02:08:23.840 --> 02:08:26.195
Very personable man.

02:08:28.920 --> 02:08:31.639
My father
passed away in 1959.

02:08:31.720 --> 02:08:35.952
A young man.
He worked on a tuna boat.

02:08:36.040 --> 02:08:38.190
He get up one morning,

02:08:38.280 --> 02:08:41.556
some weather,
nothing dramatic,

02:08:42.560 --> 02:08:44.630
and he never returned.

02:08:44.720 --> 02:08:47.678
No signals, no maydays.

02:08:47.760 --> 02:08:50.991
No one ever found out
what happened to him.

02:10:11.760 --> 02:10:13.432
I'm going to get
some ice cream.

02:10:13.520 --> 02:10:15.829
Go ahead.

02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:17.319
Can I have some money?

02:10:19.680 --> 02:10:21.113
Yes.

02:10:50.720 --> 02:10:53.280
So, when am I supposed
to move in with Georgie?

02:10:53.360 --> 02:10:54.509
July.

02:10:56.800 --> 02:10:58.552
I don't even have
a place to live, yet.

02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:00.631
They don't give you
an apartment?

02:11:00.720 --> 02:11:03.188
Yeah, but I'm looking for one
with an extra room.

02:11:04.120 --> 02:11:06.509
Or room
for a pull-out sofa.

02:11:06.600 --> 02:11:08.352
What for?

02:11:16.440 --> 02:11:18.510
So you can come
visit sometime.

02:11:21.760 --> 02:11:24.672
Or if you're going to look at colleges
in Boston, you can stay overnight.

02:11:24.760 --> 02:11:26.432
I'm not going to college.

02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:30.949
Well, I'll have an extra room
for all my shit.

02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:35.714
Do we have to talk
about this now?

02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:37.119
No.

02:11:48.760 --> 02:11:50.159
Great throw.

02:11:54.760 --> 02:11:56.159
Just let it go.

02:11:59.240 --> 02:12:00.559
Heads up.
