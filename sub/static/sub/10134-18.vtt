08:22.961 --> 08:26.298
You see, we were wearing

08:22.961 --> 08:26.298
each other's clothes.

08:28.049 --> 08:30.844
Mom, uh, dad,

08:28.049 --> 08:30.844
this is Joey Gladstone

08:30.885 --> 08:32.387
and my co-host,

08:30.885 --> 08:32.387
Danny Tanner.

08:32.429 --> 08:34.348
Remember those tapes

08:32.429 --> 08:34.348
of our show I sent you?

08:34.389 --> 08:36.599
Oh, of course.

08:39.478 --> 08:42.022
You look taller

08:39.478 --> 08:42.022
without your pants.

08:44.149 --> 08:45.233
Thank you for noticing.

08:47.110 --> 08:50.530
Aw, we missed everything.

08:50.571 --> 08:52.366
Nice look, dad.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.493
Excuse us.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.120
Jess, could I

08:54.534 --> 08:57.120
see you a moment?

09:00.832 --> 09:02.876
Jess, I just wanted

09:00.832 --> 09:02.876
everything to be perfect.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.169
The tuxedos don't fit

09:04.211 --> 09:06.713
Michelle's upset

09:04.211 --> 09:06.713
because Howie's a boy.

09:06.754 --> 09:08.673
You and my dad

09:06.754 --> 09:08.673
hate each other.

09:08.715 --> 09:11.218
Aw, sweetheart.

09:11.259 --> 09:13.553
I admit it wasn't

09:11.259 --> 09:13.553
love at first sight

09:13.594 --> 09:16.764
but...you weren't crazy about me

09:13.594 --> 09:16.764
the first time we met.

09:16.806 --> 09:20.060
Guess it just

09:16.806 --> 09:20.060
runs in your family.

09:20.101 --> 09:22.062
Look, I promise you..

09:22.103 --> 09:24.356
...I'll be friends

09:22.103 --> 09:24.356
with your dad, okay?

09:24.398 --> 09:26.816
- You promise?

09:24.398 --> 09:26.816
- I promise.

09:26.858 --> 09:28.402
All that stuff,

09:26.858 --> 09:28.402
it doesn't matter.

09:28.443 --> 09:31.405
All that matters is

09:28.443 --> 09:31.405
tomorrow at 10 a.m.

09:31.446 --> 09:33.573
you and I are gonna

09:31.446 --> 09:33.573
be husband and wife.

09:36.617 --> 09:38.119
You're right.

09:38.161 --> 09:40.621
- I love you.

09:38.161 --> 09:40.621
- I love you, too.

09:47.670 --> 09:51.007
The last kiss

09:47.670 --> 09:51.007
before the big "I do."

09:51.049 --> 09:53.134
A moment to be treasured.

09:53.176 --> 09:54.886
I'm D.J. Tanner.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.350
[instrumental music]

10:05.105 --> 10:06.814
[exhales sharply]

10:06.856 --> 10:11.069
I am Raphael, the

10:06.856 --> 10:11.069
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles!"

10:13.488 --> 10:14.989
Excuse me.

10:16.199 --> 10:17.825
Excuse me.

10:18.910 --> 10:21.246
I said, excuse me!

10:21.288 --> 10:24.916
Be quiet, Shredder,

10:21.288 --> 10:24.916
you bad guy.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.668
Let's play Barbie dolls.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.713
I could pull her head off.

10:30.755 --> 10:32.840
Drop that doll,

10:30.755 --> 10:32.840
you turtle.

10:35.093 --> 10:37.678
This is nuts.

10:35.093 --> 10:37.678
I'm out of here.

10:39.055 --> 10:40.515
What did I do?

10:40.557 --> 10:41.766
Boys.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.104
I do.

10:48.315 --> 10:49.816
<i>I</i> do.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.860
Ho, I do.

10:54.571 --> 10:56.239
Hi, Jess.

10:56.281 --> 10:57.324
Hello, Mr. Donaldson.

10:57.365 --> 11:00.410
Oh, call me Kenneth.

11:00.452 --> 11:02.745
Kenneth, listen, uh,

11:00.452 --> 11:02.745
I-I'm sorry about before.

11:02.787 --> 11:05.248
We-we got kind of off

11:02.787 --> 11:05.248
to a bad start, didn't we?

11:05.290 --> 11:08.084
[chuckles]

11:05.290 --> 11:08.084
Listen, you're gonna

11:05.290 --> 11:08.084
marry my daughter.

11:08.126 --> 11:10.462
We need to start

11:08.126 --> 11:10.462
acting like family.

11:10.504 --> 11:12.671
Great.

11:10.504 --> 11:12.671
Can you loan me ten bucks?

11:12.713 --> 11:14.466
[laughing]

11:14.508 --> 11:16.343
A little

11:14.508 --> 11:16.343
son father-in-law humor.

11:16.384 --> 11:17.469
'Yeah.'

11:18.303 --> 11:19.678
Jesse, we need to talk.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.598
Yes. Yes, we do.

11:21.640 --> 11:24.351
Listen, sir, I love

11:21.640 --> 11:24.351
your daughter very, very much.

11:24.392 --> 11:26.853
And I'm gonna take very good

11:24.392 --> 11:26.853
care of her. I promise.

11:26.894 --> 11:29.772
[sighs]

11:26.894 --> 11:29.772
Which reminds me, uh..

11:29.814 --> 11:33.067
...I couldn't help but notice

11:29.814 --> 11:33.067
that you ride a motorcycle

11:33.109 --> 11:35.236
you play

11:33.109 --> 11:35.236
in a rock and roll band

11:35.278 --> 11:38.739
you, uh, wear clothes

11:35.278 --> 11:38.739
that should be wallets.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.621
Oh, there's much more

11:42.369 --> 11:44.621
to me than that, sir.

11:44.663 --> 11:46.039
I'm also an Elvis freak.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.915
See, I got pictures,

11:46.080 --> 11:47.915
I got a big color of him here.

11:47.957 --> 11:50.835
- Beautiful.

11:47.957 --> 11:50.835
- That's fine, son.

11:50.877 --> 11:53.004
But you're marrying

11:50.877 --> 11:53.004
my baby tomorrow.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.756
You got to put all

11:53.046 --> 11:55.756
that nonsense behind you.

11:55.798 --> 11:56.966
Yeah, this wouldn't

11:55.798 --> 11:56.966
be you telling me

11:57.008 --> 11:58.717
how to live my life,

11:57.008 --> 11:58.717
would it?

11:58.759 --> 12:02.639
No, I am just offering you

11:58.759 --> 12:02.639
the benefit of my experience.

12:02.681 --> 12:04.807
You know,

12:02.681 --> 12:04.807
you and I are lot alike.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.395
Oh, yeah.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.395
We're two peas in a pod.

12:08.436 --> 12:10.564
[chuckles]

12:08.436 --> 12:10.564
Exactly.

12:10.605 --> 12:13.692
When I was your age,

12:10.605 --> 12:13.692
I was a wild one, just like you.

12:13.732 --> 12:16.695
- No.

12:13.732 --> 12:16.695
- Yes.

12:16.735 --> 12:18.737
Well, before

12:16.735 --> 12:18.737
I settled down to farming

12:18.779 --> 12:20.574
I was on the rodeo circuit.

12:20.615 --> 12:24.077
I could hog-tie a calf

12:20.615 --> 12:24.077
in under seven seconds.

12:24.118 --> 12:25.953
You know, I-I've always

12:24.118 --> 12:25.953
wondered, this is a mystery.

12:25.995 --> 12:28.373
Now, if it's hog-tie,

12:25.995 --> 12:28.373
and it's a calf

12:28.415 --> 12:30.333
why don't they

12:28.415 --> 12:30.333
call it calf-tie?

12:32.085 --> 12:34.629
Stay with me, son. I'm going

12:32.085 --> 12:34.629
somewhere with this, okay?

12:36.590 --> 12:38.425
Now, when I married Nedra

12:38.466 --> 12:40.968
I had to hang up

12:38.466 --> 12:40.968
my spurs and settle down.

12:41.010 --> 12:42.761
And so will you.

12:42.803 --> 12:45.181
- I will?

12:42.803 --> 12:45.181
- Sure.

12:45.223 --> 12:47.267
You're gonna be

12:45.223 --> 12:47.267
a husband with a wife

12:47.308 --> 12:50.061
responsibilities,

12:47.308 --> 12:50.061
commitments.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.730
That's pretty heavy,

12:50.103 --> 12:51.730
isn't it?

12:51.770 --> 12:53.481
Gets heavier.

12:53.523 --> 12:56.484
You plan

12:53.523 --> 12:56.484
on having kids someday?

12:56.526 --> 12:59.778
- Yeah.

12:56.526 --> 12:59.778
- Alright. Now you picture this.

12:59.820 --> 13:01.698
You're holding

12:59.820 --> 13:01.698
your little baby boy.

13:02.616 --> 13:04.075
Jesse junior?

13:04.117 --> 13:06.286
- Jesse junior.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.286
- Oh.

13:06.327 --> 13:10.123
And one look into

13:06.327 --> 13:10.123
that sweet, innocent face

13:10.164 --> 13:12.041
and you'll be trading

13:10.164 --> 13:12.041
in your Harley

13:12.083 --> 13:14.753
for a sensible

13:12.083 --> 13:14.753
family station wagon.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.423
I'm driving a station wagon?

13:18.465 --> 13:21.217
With one of those Garfield dolls

13:18.465 --> 13:21.217
suckered to the window.

13:22.801 --> 13:24.345
Am I listening to talk radio?

13:24.387 --> 13:26.097
All five buttons.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.182
Stop.

13:28.224 --> 13:31.060
Son, what I'm saying is..

13:31.102 --> 13:33.396
...you've had your last

13:31.102 --> 13:33.396
wild adventure

13:33.438 --> 13:35.523
sowed your last wild oat

13:35.565 --> 13:37.900
rode your last bucking bronco.

13:37.942 --> 13:40.320
Get the point? It's over.

13:40.361 --> 13:43.406
Case closed, kiss it goodbye,

13:40.361 --> 13:43.406
the fat lady sang--

13:43.448 --> 13:44.907
I got it. I got it.

13:46.200 --> 13:50.288
Now...if you've

13:46.200 --> 13:50.288
got any doubts

13:50.330 --> 13:52.332
you better not walk down

13:50.330 --> 13:52.332
that aisle tomorrow.

13:53.416 --> 13:56.835
- Understand?

13:53.416 --> 13:56.835
- Yes, sir.

13:56.877 --> 13:59.798
Well...you sleep tight.

14:04.093 --> 14:05.844
Whoa.

14:05.886 --> 14:07.555
[instrumental music]

14:10.558 --> 14:12.435
Jess, it's 7 o'clock

14:10.558 --> 14:12.435
in the morning.

14:12.477 --> 14:14.020
Where are you taking me?

14:14.061 --> 14:16.690
Shh! Joseph, just trust me.

14:14.061 --> 14:16.690
This is very important to me.

14:16.731 --> 14:19.776
Jess, you're getting

14:16.731 --> 14:19.776
married in three hours.

14:19.818 --> 14:21.361
You are getting married,

14:19.818 --> 14:21.361
aren't you?

14:21.402 --> 14:22.696
Joseph, come on,

14:21.402 --> 14:22.696
I'll explain everything

14:22.737 --> 14:24.238
on the way to the airport.

14:24.280 --> 14:27.659
- The airport?

14:24.280 --> 14:27.659
- Yes. Now, come on!

14:27.701 --> 14:28.827
Shh.

14:36.417 --> 14:37.585
Michelle?

14:39.337 --> 14:41.589
Michelle. Honey, wake up.

14:43.341 --> 14:45.176
Have you seen Uncle Jesse?

14:45.218 --> 14:47.762
No "Good morning, Michelle?"

14:49.639 --> 14:52.183
I'm sorry.

14:49.639 --> 14:52.183
Good morning, Michelle.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.143
Now, have you

14:52.225 --> 14:54.143
seen Uncle Jesse?

14:54.185 --> 14:56.563
No good morning kiss?

14:58.356 --> 14:59.524
What was I thinking?

15:01.192 --> 15:03.986
There. Now,

15:01.192 --> 15:03.986
have you seen Uncle Jesse?

15:04.028 --> 15:07.281
No, but thank you

15:04.028 --> 15:07.281
for asking.

15:11.327 --> 15:12.995
I knew she was setting me up.

15:14.622 --> 15:15.874
[knock on door]

15:15.915 --> 15:17.124
Jesse?

15:19.794 --> 15:21.212
<i>Hola,</i> Mr. T.

15:22.756 --> 15:25.132
Kimmy, I'm going through

15:22.756 --> 15:25.132
a major crisis right now.

15:25.174 --> 15:27.009
Hey, we all got problems.

15:27.051 --> 15:30.722
[screaming]

15:27.051 --> 15:30.722
D.J.!

15:30.764 --> 15:32.014
I got to build a moat.

15:33.516 --> 15:34.768
Kimmy, what is it?

15:34.809 --> 15:37.353
D.J., what should I wear

15:34.809 --> 15:37.353
to the wedding?

15:37.395 --> 15:38.855
This dress with these shoes

15:38.897 --> 15:40.648
or this dress

15:38.897 --> 15:40.648
with these shoes?

15:40.690 --> 15:42.776
Kimmy, those are my clothes.

15:42.817 --> 15:44.527
That's why I'm asking you.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.781
I found a note

15:45.945 --> 15:47.781
on the fridge from Uncle Jesse.

15:47.822 --> 15:49.282
- Read it, Steph.

15:47.822 --> 15:49.282
- Wait.

15:49.323 --> 15:51.033
I want to get this

15:49.323 --> 15:51.033
on our wedding videotape.

15:55.705 --> 15:57.916
Okay. I'm ready.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.627
Action.

16:00.668 --> 16:04.839
"Dear family, you must be

16:00.668 --> 16:04.839
wondering where I went.

16:04.881 --> 16:06.299
"I kidnapped Joey

16:06.340 --> 16:08.217
"but we'll be back

16:06.340 --> 16:08.217
for the wedding.

16:08.259 --> 16:10.678
"There was one thing

16:08.259 --> 16:10.678
I had to do

16:10.720 --> 16:13.306
before I got married, Jesse."

16:13.347 --> 16:16.267
Let me do that again.

16:13.347 --> 16:16.267
I can do better.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.894
"Dear family--"

16:17.936 --> 16:20.688
Steph.

16:20.730 --> 16:24.066
Oh, man. Jesse's getting

16:20.730 --> 16:24.066
married in two hours.

16:24.108 --> 16:25.610
Where the heck could he be?

16:27.069 --> 16:29.405
(Joey)

16:27.069 --> 16:29.405
'Jess, you're totally

16:27.069 --> 16:29.405
out of your mind.'

16:29.447 --> 16:32.659
I know. I said I'd

16:29.447 --> 16:32.659
never get in a plane with you.

16:32.700 --> 16:35.411
No, I'm talking about skydiving.

16:32.700 --> 16:35.411
It's crazy.

16:35.453 --> 16:37.705
Joey, people say

16:35.453 --> 16:37.705
it's the ultimate rush.

16:37.747 --> 16:39.499
I took all the lessons,

16:37.747 --> 16:39.499
but I never jumped

16:39.540 --> 16:41.208
because it was too windy.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.460
Joseph,

16:41.250 --> 16:42.460
I got to have this one

16:42.502 --> 16:44.587
last adventure

16:42.502 --> 16:44.587
before I get married.

16:44.629 --> 16:47.632
Well, do you have to do this

16:44.629 --> 16:47.632
on your wedding day?

16:47.674 --> 16:51.803
This is the last hour

16:47.674 --> 16:51.803
of life as a single guy.

16:51.845 --> 16:54.096
I-I, pretty soon

16:51.845 --> 16:54.096
I'm gonna-I'm gonna be married.

16:54.138 --> 16:56.432
I'm gonna have a family

16:54.138 --> 16:56.432
with all the responsibilities.

16:56.474 --> 16:59.226
I mean, what am I gonna do then,

16:56.474 --> 16:59.226
jump out of a station wagon?

16:59.268 --> 17:03.147
Well, you could. Your chute

16:59.268 --> 17:03.147
might not open in time.

17:03.189 --> 17:06.108
Joey, look, I-I have to do

17:03.189 --> 17:06.108
this last crazy thing

17:06.150 --> 17:08.486
before I give it all up

17:06.150 --> 17:08.486
for the woman that I love.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.655
Isn't flying with me

17:08.528 --> 17:10.655
crazy enough?

17:10.697 --> 17:11.865
No.

17:11.906 --> 17:13.616
How about when I do this?

17:13.658 --> 17:15.117
[Jesse screaming]

17:20.247 --> 17:21.582
Don't do that!

17:23.459 --> 17:25.044
I got this

17:23.459 --> 17:25.044
all planned out.

17:25.085 --> 17:27.171
I stashed my Harley,

17:25.085 --> 17:27.171
I got my tux on.

17:27.213 --> 17:28.589
I do the jump,

17:27.213 --> 17:28.589
hop on my Harley

17:28.631 --> 17:30.216
cruise to the chapel

17:28.631 --> 17:30.216
in just enough time

17:30.257 --> 17:32.886
to remousse my hair

17:30.257 --> 17:32.886
and say "I do."

17:32.927 --> 17:35.805
Oh, great plan. Can I make

17:32.927 --> 17:35.805
one little suggestion?

17:35.847 --> 17:37.139
What?

17:37.181 --> 17:39.058
Snap out of it.

17:41.101 --> 17:43.521
Joey, this is something I have

17:41.101 --> 17:43.521
to do for myself, alright?

17:45.398 --> 17:46.858
Alright.

17:46.900 --> 17:50.110
Well, have a safe trip.

17:46.900 --> 17:50.110
Good luck, buddy.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.612
Thanks, pal.

17:55.366 --> 17:59.203
Oh, and Joseph,

17:55.366 --> 17:59.203
if anything goes wrong

17:59.245 --> 18:00.997
I want you to marry Becky.

18:04.542 --> 18:05.835
Whoa.

18:08.462 --> 18:11.173
Have mercy!

18:11.215 --> 18:12.926
Oh, my God.

18:12.967 --> 18:14.677
He jumped without his..

18:14.719 --> 18:15.970
...mousse.

18:23.519 --> 18:25.354
(Jesse)

18:23.519 --> 18:25.354
Did I forget my mousse?

18:26.355 --> 18:27.941
[instrumental music]

18:36.240 --> 18:38.618
This is D.J. Tanner

18:36.240 --> 18:38.618
live at the chapel.

18:38.659 --> 18:41.746
And there's still

18:38.659 --> 18:41.746
no sign of the groom.

18:41.788 --> 18:44.206
Dad, how do you feel?

18:44.248 --> 18:45.959
Oh, I-I feel very confident

18:46.000 --> 18:48.210
that Jesse will

18:46.000 --> 18:48.210
arrive right on time

18:48.252 --> 18:51.005
in the next...18 seconds.

18:51.047 --> 18:54.050
Is that why you're not telling

18:51.047 --> 18:54.050
Becky what's goin' on?

18:54.092 --> 18:56.427
No, that's

18:54.092 --> 18:56.427
because I'm chicken.

18:58.554 --> 19:01.432
You heard it here first.

18:58.554 --> 19:01.432
Dad is chicken.

19:02.558 --> 19:05.686
The flower girl is here.

19:06.646 --> 19:09.273
- Ooh.

19:09.315 --> 19:11.191
I'm ready for the video.

19:11.233 --> 19:13.736
My hair looks fantastic.

19:15.863 --> 19:17.156
Do something.

19:17.197 --> 19:19.826
Now I'll do my fish face.

19:25.748 --> 19:27.041
Hey, Michelle,

19:25.748 --> 19:27.041
where's Howie?

19:27.083 --> 19:30.837
Who cares?

19:27.083 --> 19:30.837
That boy is crazy.

19:32.797 --> 19:34.256
Hello, Michelle.

19:35.758 --> 19:38.136
Hello, Howie.

19:41.388 --> 19:45.518
- You look very pretty.

19:41.388 --> 19:45.518
- You're a hunk.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.271
What's a hunk?

19:49.313 --> 19:52.150
That's what D.J.

19:49.313 --> 19:52.150
calls the paper boy.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.818
Uh, cut, cut.

19:55.778 --> 19:57.488
Everything's ready up front.

19:57.530 --> 20:00.700
Oh, th-that-that's good.

19:57.530 --> 20:00.700
Th-that's very good.

20:00.741 --> 20:02.451
What's the problem?

20:02.493 --> 20:05.621
- Oh, there's no problem.

20:02.493 --> 20:05.621
- You're lying.

20:05.663 --> 20:08.166
I can tell by the way

20:05.663 --> 20:08.166
you won't look me in the eye.

20:11.044 --> 20:12.586
Can you believe this guy?

20:14.672 --> 20:16.799
Okay. There's-there's

20:14.672 --> 20:16.799
a little problem.

20:16.841 --> 20:19.677
You know how every wedding

20:16.841 --> 20:19.677
has a bride and a groom?

20:19.719 --> 20:22.471
Well, you take away the groom

20:19.719 --> 20:22.471
and that's what we have here.

20:22.513 --> 20:24.098
- You took away the groom?

20:22.513 --> 20:24.098
- I didn't take away--

20:24.140 --> 20:25.599
- What are you talking about?

20:24.140 --> 20:25.599
- What do you mean?

20:25.641 --> 20:27.601
- Where is he?

20:25.641 --> 20:27.601
- I don't know. I don't know.

20:29.062 --> 20:30.479
Aha!

20:30.521 --> 20:32.690
Why aren't we starting?

20:34.233 --> 20:36.736
Danny, is something wrong?

20:37.904 --> 20:39.405
Wrong?

20:37.904 --> 20:39.405
Oh, no. Nothing's wrong.

20:39.446 --> 20:41.157
What could

20:39.446 --> 20:41.157
possibly be wrong?

20:41.199 --> 20:42.867
No, everything's

20:41.199 --> 20:42.867
totally under control.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.827
Then why won't you look

20:42.909 --> 20:44.827
me in the eye?

20:46.204 --> 20:50.124
Well, we're, uh,

20:46.204 --> 20:50.124
we're not all here yet.

20:50.166 --> 20:51.751
Well, who's missing?

20:52.960 --> 20:55.088
I know, I know, I know.

20:56.380 --> 20:59.425
- Yes, Michelle?

20:56.380 --> 20:59.425
- Uncle Jesse is missing.

21:00.634 --> 21:02.428
Oh, my God.

21:02.469 --> 21:04.346
Stay calm.

21:04.388 --> 21:05.723
Just because

21:04.388 --> 21:05.723
the groom's not here

21:05.765 --> 21:08.642
I'm not going to let that

21:05.765 --> 21:08.642
ruin my wedding day.

21:08.684 --> 21:11.270
- Mom.

21:08.684 --> 21:11.270
- Oh, honey.

21:11.311 --> 21:12.563
Whew! Made it.

21:12.605 --> 21:15.315
- 'Where's Jesse?'

21:12.605 --> 21:15.315
- Where's Jesse?

21:15.357 --> 21:16.817
Uh-oh.

21:16.859 --> 21:18.236
Joey, where is he?

21:18.277 --> 21:21.239
Ah, he must've stopped off

21:18.277 --> 21:21.239
for a can of mousse.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.908
Oh, thank goodness.

21:23.950 --> 21:26.577
Yeah, he forgot it

21:23.950 --> 21:26.577
when he jumped out of the plane.

21:28.121 --> 21:30.206
He jumped out of a plane?

21:30.248 --> 21:32.750
Oh, well, it's okay.

21:30.248 --> 21:32.750
I took him skydiving.

21:32.792 --> 21:35.669
Last time I saw him, he was

21:32.792 --> 21:35.669
floating safely to the earth.

21:36.545 --> 21:39.465
You took him skydiving?

21:39.506 --> 21:42.260
Well, then where is he? What if

21:39.506 --> 21:42.260
something happened to him?

21:42.301 --> 21:44.344
Don't worry, he said

21:42.301 --> 21:44.344
if anything happens

21:44.386 --> 21:46.097
I should marry you myself.

21:48.933 --> 21:51.060
Mom!

21:51.102 --> 21:52.478
It's alright.

21:52.519 --> 21:54.396
Help!

21:54.981 --> 21:56.440
Help!

21:56.482 --> 21:58.609
Becky, I'm coming!

21:58.651 --> 22:00.945
Don't marry Joey!
