WEBVTT

00:16.975 --> 00:19.519
We got lucky
with the master-welder applicants.

00:19.602 --> 00:21.813
These are the best in the nation.

00:21.896 --> 00:24.357
Our top electrician prospect

00:24.441 --> 00:27.360
is a contractor working out of Chicago.

00:27.444 --> 00:30.697
He already has
confidential security clearance,

00:30.780 --> 00:32.115
so that should save some--

00:32.198 --> 00:34.826
I'm sorry.
Are we interrupting your workout?

00:34.909 --> 00:36.870
Would you like us
to come back when you're done?

00:36.953 --> 00:39.706
Okay, cranky,
I can still do this while you talk.

00:39.789 --> 00:43.710
Well, if I'm cranky,
it's because I'm running myself ragged

00:43.793 --> 00:47.756
trying to adapt
a four-year program for moon habitation

00:47.839 --> 00:51.634
into something that's ready to launch
three days from now.

00:51.718 --> 00:52.761
China forced our hand.

00:52.844 --> 00:55.221
If we don't get up there
before they fortify their base,

00:55.305 --> 00:56.931
they could keep us off the moon forever.

00:57.015 --> 01:00.226
Sending construction workers into space.

01:00.310 --> 01:01.811
What are we thinking?

01:01.895 --> 01:05.106
Either we teach astronauts trades
that may take years to master,

01:05.190 --> 01:08.777
or we teach tradesmen
to be passengers on a rocket bus.

01:08.860 --> 01:12.530
Please keep all hands
and feet inside the vehicle at all times.

01:12.614 --> 01:15.033
Do not barf in your helmet,
or you will drown.

01:15.116 --> 01:17.077
Chan gets it.
Maybe we should let him handle this.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.746
Oh, no. Moon habitation is my life's work.

01:19.829 --> 01:21.790
I just wanted to complain a bit.

01:21.873 --> 01:23.917
Well, what a delightful waste of time.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.379
We have to make the selections today
to stay on schedule.

01:28.463 --> 01:30.965
Would you like
to call the winners with me?

01:31.049 --> 01:33.510
Uh... yeah.Â I can't.

01:33.593 --> 01:35.053
I'm not gonna be around.

01:35.136 --> 01:37.222
Chan, could you pack this stuff up for me?
Thank you.

01:40.141 --> 01:42.185
I've got my, uh, conjugal visit today.

01:42.268 --> 01:43.144
How are you feeling?

01:43.853 --> 01:46.064
I'm nervous. It's been a while.

01:46.147 --> 01:49.484
Don't put too much pressure
on the act itself.

01:49.567 --> 01:52.195
Arousal is birthed in the brain.

01:52.737 --> 01:55.573
I can't tell you how creepy it is
to watch you say the word "arousal."

01:56.157 --> 01:57.450
Just, all right, listen.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.661
I've, uh... got a cover story.

01:59.744 --> 02:00.787
I'm going to Denver.

02:00.870 --> 02:02.372
You're going to Denver?

02:02.455 --> 02:04.165
Hey, I'm going to Denver today, too.

02:04.249 --> 02:05.875
I'm taking Captain Ali to the eye doctor.

02:05.959 --> 02:06.793
Okay, good!

02:06.876 --> 02:08.795
Just make sure her eyes are healed
before the launch.

02:08.878 --> 02:10.797
Well, we should carpool, General.
Save some gas.

02:10.880 --> 02:12.257
No. No. No.

02:12.423 --> 02:13.675
No. No.

02:14.092 --> 02:15.635
No, he's not going to--

02:15.718 --> 02:16.678
No!

02:16.761 --> 02:18.721
-I don't want to carpool.
-Why not?

02:19.264 --> 02:21.266
Uh...

02:23.351 --> 02:26.563
I find your presence grating.

02:28.314 --> 02:29.149
Oh.

02:30.066 --> 02:31.401
Is it-- Did--

02:31.860 --> 02:32.777
Huh.

02:33.027 --> 02:33.945
I see.

02:34.612 --> 02:35.989
I appreciate the feedback, sir.

02:36.447 --> 02:37.574
Oh...

02:44.080 --> 02:46.332
-Do you think I hurt his feelings?
-Yeah.

02:46.416 --> 02:49.669
And I want you to include Fuck Tony
in your final selection process.

02:49.752 --> 02:51.004
Oh, hey, General.

02:51.087 --> 02:53.506
Have fun in Denver, sir.
I've always wanted to go to Denver.

02:53.590 --> 02:54.799
Thanks, spaceman.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.093
Why on earth would I do that?

02:57.177 --> 02:58.845
First time since 1972,

02:58.928 --> 03:00.513
we're gonna have Americans
walking on the moon.

03:00.597 --> 03:01.931
They're gonna be instant heroes.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.516
We need our media consultant for that.

03:03.600 --> 03:04.726
Fair enough.

03:04.809 --> 03:06.311
Have a good time in Denver, General.

03:06.394 --> 03:09.189
Just know it may not be as great
as you remember.

03:09.272 --> 03:10.106
Thank you, Hildy.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.774
Expectations managed.

03:11.941 --> 03:15.111
Uh, people certainly seem invested
in your fake trip.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.696
They care about the old man

03:16.779 --> 03:18.573
because they know
the old man cares about them.

03:18.656 --> 03:20.909
-Mm-hmm.
-Any problems, Brad'll take care of them.

03:20.992 --> 03:23.119
General, if I may offer some advice.

03:23.995 --> 03:26.122
Downtown Denver will always be there.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.625
Why not spend some time getting to know
the other parts of the city?

03:28.708 --> 03:32.045
That way, when you do go "downtown,"

03:32.128 --> 03:33.922
it will be that much more special.

03:34.005 --> 03:35.423
Yes? Okay.

03:35.757 --> 03:36.799
Happy travels.

03:38.551 --> 03:41.095
I believe your code may have been cracked.

03:46.517 --> 03:48.186
Yeah. No shit.

03:50.772 --> 03:52.941
Hey, Bug.
I was just getting ready to take off.

03:53.024 --> 03:54.442
Heard you're gonna see Mom today.

03:54.525 --> 03:56.319
-Yeah.
-I'm coming with you.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.196
Uh...

03:58.655 --> 04:01.574
I don't think that's a good idea.

04:02.033 --> 04:03.034
Why not?

04:04.577 --> 04:05.620
I don't know.

04:06.663 --> 04:07.580
Okay.

04:10.166 --> 04:11.042
Shit.

04:19.467 --> 04:20.593
Jesus, Dad, what?

04:20.677 --> 04:21.886
Nothing. Nothing.

04:22.887 --> 04:24.681
It...

04:30.103 --> 04:31.229
Let's break it down.

04:31.646 --> 04:34.607
Okay, so we're looking
for American heroes.

04:34.983 --> 04:36.067
Let me be more clear.

04:36.150 --> 04:38.778
We are looking for people
who look like heroes.

04:38.861 --> 04:39.821
No uggos.

04:39.904 --> 04:43.449
Well, Abraham Lincoln is a hero,
and he was pretty unattractive.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.243
You're insane. He was gorgeous.

04:45.326 --> 04:47.078
He was a Frankenstein without the bolts.

04:47.161 --> 04:50.123
But, now, Gerald Ford... hochi mochi!

04:50.206 --> 04:51.874
-You kidding me with that guy?

04:51.958 --> 04:53.668
-Yeah.
-He was poured into that suit.

04:53.751 --> 04:55.962
All-American,
University of Michigan football player.

04:56.045 --> 04:58.089
-Yes, please.
-Yes, please!

04:58.172 --> 05:00.591
-All day.
-I also agree, but we have work to do.

05:00.675 --> 05:01.926
Call the first one, Brad.

05:02.427 --> 05:05.138
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Mr. Ely, congratulations.

05:05.221 --> 05:08.474
You have been selected
for Project Mayflower,

05:08.558 --> 05:11.269
and we need you in Wild Horse, ASAP.

05:11.352 --> 05:14.897
I see you're working
near Sheppard Air Force Base.

05:14.981 --> 05:18.026
We can have a plane ready in an hour.
Will that work?

05:18.443 --> 05:22.322
<i>Yeah, just need to hammer out</i>
<i>the details of my contract first.</i>

05:22.822 --> 05:27.368
But the terms were agreed to
during the preliminary calls,

05:27.452 --> 05:28.369
were they not?

05:28.453 --> 05:30.705
<i>Yeah, I'm gonna need something more.</i>

05:32.248 --> 05:33.166
<i>A million dollars.</i>

05:37.337 --> 05:39.839
I don't get paid a million dollars.

05:40.882 --> 05:45.887
I mean, no government employee
gets paid a million dollars, Mr. Ely.

05:45.970 --> 05:50.308
<i>No. I heard Coach Saban</i>
<i>makes over seven million dollars a year.</i>

05:51.059 --> 05:53.269
<i>-Roll Tide!</i>
<i>-</i>Roll, Tide, roll!

05:53.353 --> 05:54.854
Oh, you would be a 'Bama fan.

05:54.937 --> 05:56.773
-Oh, I'm so sorry for liking winners.
-That's so perfect.

05:56.856 --> 05:58.941
-Quiet, please.
-Okay.

05:59.317 --> 06:01.402
Sir, the United States of America

06:01.486 --> 06:04.655
is building a permanent colony
on the moon.

06:04.739 --> 06:07.658
We are answering the call of destiny.

06:07.742 --> 06:11.412
You would jeopardize your part in this
over money?

06:11.496 --> 06:12.789
<i>Man.</i>

06:13.373 --> 06:14.540
<i>You want me,</i>

06:15.166 --> 06:16.417
<i>I should be compensated.</i>

06:16.918 --> 06:19.170
To be clear, I don't want you.

06:19.253 --> 06:23.674
You're an unfortunate necessity,
like tipping or...

06:23.883 --> 06:25.301
colonoscopies.

06:25.718 --> 06:27.136
<i>So I'm a colonoscopy?</i>

06:27.220 --> 06:30.390
It was an off-the-cuff comparison,
but I'll tell you what,

06:30.473 --> 06:31.974
if it resonates for you--

06:32.058 --> 06:32.975
<i>Hey, man, fuck you!</i>

06:33.059 --> 06:33.976
Fuck you!

06:34.060 --> 06:34.894
<i>Fuck you!</i>

06:34.977 --> 06:36.479
Fuck you!

06:37.772 --> 06:39.482
<i>-Hey.</i>
-What?

06:39.565 --> 06:40.525
<i>Fuck you.</i>

06:40.900 --> 06:42.610
Ah!

06:44.821 --> 06:47.824
By the way, there is no need
Mark should be privy

06:48.074 --> 06:50.660
to the specifics of that conversation.

06:50.743 --> 06:52.245
Are we all agreed?

06:52.328 --> 06:53.496
- Absolutely.
-Yeah.

07:04.549 --> 07:05.425
Ugh!

07:05.508 --> 07:07.343
-Okay. I don't wanna know.
-All right.

07:07.427 --> 07:08.636
-Stay here. I'll be back.
-Ew.

07:41.002 --> 07:41.961
Good choice.

07:42.712 --> 07:43.713
You like K-Pop?

07:43.796 --> 07:45.423
Yeah. Hell, yeah.

07:45.506 --> 07:48.009
I mean, K-Pop kind of jacked
their whole shit from black music,

07:48.092 --> 07:49.343
but it's okay.

07:49.427 --> 07:52.180
Actually, black people and Koreans
have tons in common.

07:52.763 --> 07:55.933
Barbecue's bangin', skincare is flawless.

07:56.684 --> 07:58.186
You know I'm not Korean, right?

07:58.644 --> 07:59.645
Yeah. Okay.

07:59.729 --> 08:01.272
-Don't get offended.
-I'm not.

08:01.355 --> 08:03.399
It's not like you know
where my people come from.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.193
Well, where did your people come from?

08:05.276 --> 08:06.194
I don't know.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.905
In third grade,
I had to do a heritage report,

08:08.988 --> 08:11.657
and I just said, "Congo?"

08:12.200 --> 08:14.118
I had just seen the movie <i>Congo.</i>

08:15.536 --> 08:18.498
Sorry, I just have a thing
about being mistaken for Korean.

08:18.915 --> 08:21.375
All my Korean friends are hotheads.

08:21.459 --> 08:24.045
One of 'em threw a fork at me
in Marie Callender's.

08:24.128 --> 08:25.254
Why?

08:25.338 --> 08:26.589
I said something about his grandma.

08:26.672 --> 08:27.590
Oof.

08:27.840 --> 08:30.510
Okay,
so your ethnicity's actually just asshole.

08:31.636 --> 08:33.262
Grandma Kim was a bitch, though.

08:43.564 --> 08:45.024
- Mmm.

08:47.068 --> 08:49.570
Oh, I miss the way your bumps feel
against my body.

08:50.905 --> 08:53.324
I think it's been a year
since I've hugged someone.

08:53.950 --> 08:55.660
Except for the Speaker of the House.

08:56.285 --> 08:57.328
Different bumps.

08:57.620 --> 08:58.746
Very different.

09:03.125 --> 09:05.169
Oh, look at you.

09:06.420 --> 09:08.589
Wait a minute. Is that a knit tie?

09:08.673 --> 09:09.632
Yeah.

09:09.715 --> 09:12.218
Dr. Mallory thought
that I could make it work.

09:12.760 --> 09:13.886
Well, I like it.

09:13.970 --> 09:15.596
-Thanks.
-Take it off.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.849
-Okay. I will. I will.

09:19.141 --> 09:20.977
You know, I was thinking of how we could

09:21.060 --> 09:23.104
-maximize our time here together.
-Uh-huh.

09:23.187 --> 09:26.107
There's a strategy in basketball
called a two-for-one

09:26.607 --> 09:31.946
in which the team tries to take a shot
early in order to get the ball back

09:32.029 --> 09:34.198
so they can shoot again
before time runs out.

09:34.282 --> 09:36.742
Oh. Oh, I like where your head is at.

09:36.826 --> 09:37.994
-Yeah?
-Okay.

09:42.498 --> 09:43.791
-Okay.
-Hmm?

09:43.958 --> 09:45.084
What's the secret here?

09:45.167 --> 09:46.919
-It's a zipper.Â That's it.
-All right.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.841
How does that thing work? Okay.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.593
What are we doing here?

09:53.676 --> 09:55.011
-Yeah.
- Agh.

09:55.469 --> 09:58.723
I wish I had my multi-tool.
They took it when I walked in.

09:59.932 --> 10:01.934
-Oh, oh, be careful, don't rip it.

10:02.018 --> 10:03.519
Well, I'll buy you a new one.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.021
Yeah, no, it's just that--

10:05.104 --> 10:06.647
No, it comes out of my commissary,

10:06.731 --> 10:08.941
and I'm almost at my limit
for this month, so...

10:09.025 --> 10:10.443
-Okay. All right.
-I have to be...

10:11.235 --> 10:12.236
All right.

10:13.154 --> 10:14.113
Mmm.

10:15.781 --> 10:16.741
Mmm...

10:19.660 --> 10:21.996
Are you doing something different
with your upper lip?

10:22.079 --> 10:22.913
No.

10:24.540 --> 10:25.875
Uh... okay.

10:25.958 --> 10:28.919
Just seems like it's a little more active.

10:30.004 --> 10:31.172
-Hmm.
-I don't know.

10:31.255 --> 10:32.423
-It's the same.
-You know what?

10:32.506 --> 10:36.594
Let's not think about a two-for-one
or a three-for-one or any of that stuff.

10:36.677 --> 10:39.472
-Mm-hmm.
-Let's just, uh, practice, all right?

10:39.555 --> 10:41.057
-Okay. Yeah.
-Okay.

10:41.766 --> 10:42.642
All right.

10:44.602 --> 10:46.646
Maybe we should see what happens if we...

10:46.729 --> 10:48.898
All right. That might put us in the mood.

11:13.964 --> 11:15.841
Yo! Erin!

11:21.430 --> 11:22.682
How do you know my name?

11:23.766 --> 11:26.602
Maggie's the only one
who gets her beefcake helicoptered in.

11:27.019 --> 11:28.479
Figured you must be her daughter.

11:29.271 --> 11:31.440
She say you're smart,
but you don't look it.

11:32.108 --> 11:35.945
Okay, well,
I am on this side of the fence, so...

11:36.529 --> 11:37.655
Oh...

11:38.197 --> 11:39.907
Definitely Maggie's kid.

11:41.575 --> 11:45.955
You're not gonna, like, shiv my mom
in the shower 'cause I was mean, are you?

11:48.916 --> 11:51.419
No. She'd probably put me
out of the book club.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.630
-Let's go.
-Wait, wait, wait! Wait.

11:54.880 --> 11:55.715
Sorry.

11:56.048 --> 11:57.174
So, you know my mom?

11:57.925 --> 11:59.093
How's she doing in there?

12:00.094 --> 12:02.972
This is my rec time.
You wanna talk? Keep up.

12:06.934 --> 12:07.893
Keep going.

12:09.019 --> 12:10.396
Yeah, just keep going straight.

12:10.855 --> 12:12.273
Why are you're walking like a ninja?

12:12.356 --> 12:14.608
Okay, can you just, like, lead me, please?

12:15.860 --> 12:17.194
-No, no, no, no.
-Like, just--

12:17.278 --> 12:18.529
I'm not comfortable with that.

12:18.612 --> 12:20.990
Two adult acquaintances
should not be holding hands.

12:21.198 --> 12:24.285
What? Why? Who are you
trying to seem single for, huh?

12:24.368 --> 12:26.370
That guy? Ooh. He has cats.

12:26.454 --> 12:27.705
I'm sorry, I just--

12:27.788 --> 12:29.540
Since I can't see,
my sense of smell is heightened.

12:29.623 --> 12:30.458
Fine.

12:33.878 --> 12:34.962
Hold on to my shirt.

12:35.379 --> 12:36.839
-What?
-Hold onto my shirt.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.257
-I--
-Come on.

12:38.340 --> 12:40.050
No. No, this looks ridiculous.

12:40.134 --> 12:41.385
How do you know? You can't see.

12:41.469 --> 12:43.888
Because there's no version
of a man leading a woman on a leash

12:43.971 --> 12:45.055
that looks cool.

12:45.139 --> 12:46.849
- Whoa!
-Watch where I'm going!

12:46.932 --> 12:49.393
I am! I just led you
around a huge pile of spiders.

12:49.477 --> 12:52.229
-Oh! Why--
-Okay, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

12:52.688 --> 12:53.647
It's a joke.

12:53.731 --> 12:55.149
Oh, that was a joke.

12:55.524 --> 12:57.943
Oh, yeah, I get why it's funny.
Right, because I can't see,

12:58.027 --> 12:59.612
and I'm trying to protect myself,
and I can't.

12:59.695 --> 13:01.614
Yeah, that's very funny.
You're very good at humor.

13:01.697 --> 13:02.656
Thank you.

13:05.201 --> 13:07.036
-What was that?
- Your shadow?

13:12.291 --> 13:13.375
So how's work?

13:14.043 --> 13:15.002
It's fine.

13:15.920 --> 13:16.796
Really?

13:17.296 --> 13:18.631
Yeah. Yeah.

13:19.089 --> 13:20.800
Rockets go up, rockets come down.

13:21.175 --> 13:22.134
The usual.

13:22.968 --> 13:25.054
-Why was our last visit canceled?

13:25.137 --> 13:26.555
Oh, it was nothing.

13:26.639 --> 13:27.765
It was just a blip.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.726
Louise said the president was mad at you.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.478
Mm. No. It was a blip.

13:36.273 --> 13:37.525
How's your work?

13:37.983 --> 13:39.109
Oh, it's okay.

13:39.652 --> 13:43.989
Yeah. I mean, I don't see myself
cutting eyeglass lenses forever.

13:44.698 --> 13:46.867
But you cannot get a library job

13:46.951 --> 13:49.620
unless someone dies
or gets beat really bad.

13:50.204 --> 13:51.372
Well, give it time.

13:53.457 --> 13:55.709
Yeah, Mark. Think I will give it time.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.798
Maggie, I didn't mean to make you upset.

14:00.881 --> 14:01.757
You didn't.

14:03.342 --> 14:06.178
So how's everything else going?

14:06.262 --> 14:07.346
Um...

14:08.264 --> 14:10.099
I'm playing a lot of clarinet.

14:10.182 --> 14:12.059
I always thought
you wanted to play the harp.

14:12.142 --> 14:15.437
Yeah. They don't allow string instruments
in here.

14:15.521 --> 14:18.065
It's a suicide-murder thing.

14:18.148 --> 14:19.817
-Well...
-Which is ridiculous,

14:19.900 --> 14:23.070
'cause I could easily kill someone
with a clarinet. You know?

14:23.153 --> 14:24.446
Blunt force trauma.

14:24.989 --> 14:27.533
Internal bleeding, or, smack,
brain someone.

14:27.616 --> 14:28.492
Jesus, Maggie.

14:28.576 --> 14:29.910
Hey, I'm not gonna do it.

14:29.994 --> 14:32.746
I'm just saying, I mean, I could,

14:32.830 --> 14:36.375
given the opportunity
and the right provocation,

14:36.458 --> 14:37.668
the right provocation.

14:37.751 --> 14:40.421
Well, I'm just... I'm glad
you're learning an instrument.

14:41.630 --> 14:43.883
Okay, we're only 100,000 over budget,

14:43.966 --> 14:46.719
and we have to send the plumber the--
Who-- What tickets?

14:46.802 --> 14:48.178
-Brooks & Dunn.
-Ah.

14:48.345 --> 14:49.930
Uh... next candidate, please.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.141
Well, that was the last one.

14:52.224 --> 14:55.644
And we still don't have an electrician
or an HVAC specialist.

14:55.978 --> 14:58.606
I didn't anticipate so many people

14:58.689 --> 15:01.358
losing their nerve at the last minute.

15:01.442 --> 15:02.943
So you gotta improvise.

15:03.152 --> 15:04.361
Launch what we got.

15:04.445 --> 15:05.988
It's jazz, baby!

15:06.071 --> 15:08.240
You seem like the type of guy
who pretends to like jazz.

15:08.324 --> 15:09.700
We can't improvise this.

15:09.783 --> 15:13.704
Failure in either of those systems
could be catastrophic,

15:13.787 --> 15:15.080
and we don't have enough time

15:15.164 --> 15:19.043
to launch another nationwide search
for more candidates.

15:19.126 --> 15:21.211
I mean... this is a disaster!

15:21.712 --> 15:24.006
-Yeah.
-My career is ruined!

15:24.465 --> 15:25.674
I'm kaput!

15:26.717 --> 15:32.139
No! I spent years training
for this very moment!

15:32.222 --> 15:33.849
There has to be a way.

15:34.642 --> 15:37.811
Well, uh, I found an electrician nearby
with five stars.

15:38.187 --> 15:41.148
Uh, he promises,
"shockingly good results."

15:41.231 --> 15:42.399
That's kinda fun.

15:42.483 --> 15:43.776
Don't be an idiot, Brad.

15:43.859 --> 15:45.110
Yeah, don't be foolish, Brad,

15:45.194 --> 15:49.448
because anyone can have five stars
if they only have one or two reviews.

15:49.531 --> 15:51.575
How many reviews does he have?

16:07.299 --> 16:08.926
Hey. Wait, are you dancing?

16:10.344 --> 16:11.178
No.

16:11.929 --> 16:13.639
I don't learn K-Pop dances.

16:14.056 --> 16:15.641
There was like a fly in here.

16:16.308 --> 16:17.601
-Oh.
-You know?

16:31.991 --> 16:33.033
Whoo.

16:36.620 --> 16:39.415
Well, this explains
how the cops caught you.

16:39.498 --> 16:41.125
How are you not tired?

16:41.583 --> 16:43.544
Used to run track when we lived in DC.

16:43.627 --> 16:44.712
Not anymore?

16:44.795 --> 16:46.839
Only when I go to prison, apparently.

16:48.132 --> 16:50.134
So, how are you and my mom friends?

16:50.426 --> 16:52.636
Oh, everybody's friends with Maggie.

16:52.720 --> 16:53.804
Or wants to be.

16:54.054 --> 16:56.348
She runs
the most exclusive book club in here.

16:57.057 --> 16:57.891
Great.

16:58.183 --> 17:01.520
My mom has more friends in prison
than I do in the outside world.

17:01.603 --> 17:02.563
Hmm.

17:02.646 --> 17:04.982
You wouldn't happen to have,
like, a meth-head daughter

17:05.065 --> 17:07.151
I could grab brunch with sometime,
would you?

17:14.450 --> 17:15.659
Ha-ha.

17:17.036 --> 17:20.581
Hey, remember our trip
to Palo Duro Canyon?

17:20.748 --> 17:22.291
Oh.

17:22.374 --> 17:23.208
God.

17:23.917 --> 17:27.004
-Yeah, "America's second-largest canyon"?
-Yeah.

17:27.087 --> 17:30.049
What, did we think the Grand Canyon
would be too overwhelming?

17:30.466 --> 17:31.300
Stupid.

17:31.383 --> 17:35.888
All right, well, when you get out,
we will go to the Grand Canyon.

17:37.097 --> 17:38.307
In 40 years?

17:38.849 --> 17:39.933
I don't wanna talk about that.

17:40.017 --> 17:41.977
Well, I... honey,
I thought it might distract you.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.646
Well, I don't need to be distracted.
I need to accept what is.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.523
Okay. Maggie, what's going on?

17:46.607 --> 17:47.566
Nothing.

17:50.569 --> 17:51.528
Oh, God.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.614
I didn't want to do this till the end.

17:54.281 --> 17:55.115
Do what?

17:56.575 --> 17:57.409
Yeah.

17:58.118 --> 18:01.455
Um, I think we need to talk about
our relationship.

18:02.206 --> 18:03.082
Um...

18:03.832 --> 18:06.585
I think--
I think we should have an open marriage.

18:08.253 --> 18:10.631
Open to what, exactly?

18:11.131 --> 18:16.678
Open to the, the notion of us
having relationships that are intimate

18:16.762 --> 18:19.515
with people that are accessible to us.

18:21.600 --> 18:22.851
No.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.478
No? Just like that?

18:24.561 --> 18:25.562
Just like that.

18:25.646 --> 18:26.939
You're being ridiculous.

18:27.439 --> 18:28.398
Okay.

18:28.816 --> 18:29.650
Let's see.

18:30.025 --> 18:31.443
You have notes?

18:31.527 --> 18:32.528
Well...

18:33.403 --> 18:36.323
"Leaders must always be open
to suggestions

18:36.406 --> 18:38.826
that can improve
the organization's vision."

18:38.909 --> 18:40.536
Do not quote the Air Force handbook to me.

18:40.619 --> 18:43.455
"Team members need to feel
comfortable enough

18:43.539 --> 18:47.000
to think outside the box
and share their thoughts..."

18:47.084 --> 18:47.918
This is stupid!

18:48.001 --> 18:49.461
-"...and ideas..."
-No.

18:49.545 --> 18:53.090
"...without fear of being
shut down or discounted.

18:53.173 --> 18:56.051
It is the hallmark of a trust-based team."

18:56.135 --> 18:58.262
I'm not even in the Air Force anymore.

18:58.345 --> 19:01.557
I'm gonna be in here for 40 years.

19:01.640 --> 19:05.519
I would like to have a relationship
with a human being

19:05.602 --> 19:07.563
without having to be dishonest.

19:07.646 --> 19:10.274
This is a woman's prison, Maggie.
You're not gay.

19:10.357 --> 19:11.316
No!

19:11.400 --> 19:14.153
But I'm not 100% straight, either.

19:14.820 --> 19:15.863
You're bisexual?

19:15.946 --> 19:17.030
It's complicated.

19:17.114 --> 19:19.408
Well, great. Lay it on me.

19:19.491 --> 19:20.826
I can deal with complicated.

19:20.909 --> 19:22.786
I talk to scientists all day long.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.246
About their sexual needs?

19:24.872 --> 19:26.665
I could. I choose not to.

19:27.457 --> 19:28.458
All right, Mark.

19:28.542 --> 19:32.796
Okay, this has nothing to do with
how good we are when we're together.

19:33.046 --> 19:36.341
This is about what happens
when you leave here

19:36.425 --> 19:38.343
and go back to live your life.

19:41.388 --> 19:43.390
Well, then...

19:45.517 --> 19:47.644
why don't you just ask me for a divorce?

19:49.897 --> 19:50.772
No!

19:53.233 --> 19:54.735
No. Our marriage...

19:55.402 --> 19:59.698
Our marriage is not just about
sexual exclusivity.

20:00.699 --> 20:03.160
It's... It's about love.

20:03.368 --> 20:06.288
And honesty and support.

20:06.914 --> 20:08.081
And Erin.

20:10.626 --> 20:13.003
It's a declaration to the whole world

20:13.587 --> 20:16.506
that we've got each other's backs,
no matter what.

20:17.174 --> 20:18.884
And I don't wanna lose that.

20:20.844 --> 20:21.845
Do you?

20:32.689 --> 20:33.607
Okay.

20:35.817 --> 20:37.027
What are we doing?

20:38.237 --> 20:39.613
We've been apart too long.

20:41.448 --> 20:43.617
We've forgotten how good we are together.

20:45.827 --> 20:48.330
No. It's not about that, Mark.

20:48.413 --> 20:49.456
Oh...

20:49.665 --> 20:51.792
Oh, God. Okay. Well, that's unfair.

20:54.544 --> 20:55.379
Hey.

20:56.088 --> 20:56.964
Hmm.

20:57.297 --> 20:58.298
I love you.

21:00.968 --> 21:02.219
I love you, too.

21:18.151 --> 21:20.946
If that zipper doesn't come straight down,

21:21.029 --> 21:23.573
I am bombing this place to dust.

21:25.117 --> 21:28.036
So, it's the same show,
just two different names.

21:28.120 --> 21:32.749
No. One is <i>Fullmetal Alchemist, </i>one is
<i>Fullmetal Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood.</i>

21:32.833 --> 21:34.668
-Two different shows.
<i>-</i>Right, so one's a sequel.

21:34.751 --> 21:35.585
Okay, I got it.

21:35.669 --> 21:36.628
No!

21:36.712 --> 21:37.754
It's parallel!

21:37.838 --> 21:39.923
They're like, uh, alternate dimensions.

21:40.007 --> 21:41.591
What, like one of 'em's a dream?

21:41.675 --> 21:44.469
<i>Full Metal Alchemist</i> came first,
but it caught up to the manga,

21:44.553 --> 21:46.346
so they have to make up their own stuff.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.432
<i>Brotherhood </i>came after the manga!

21:48.515 --> 21:50.851
Okay, but which one has Batman?

21:50.934 --> 21:52.561
What are you talking about?

21:57.357 --> 21:58.233
Oh.

22:00.736 --> 22:05.198
Do not mansplain anime to me,
you rude, rude bitch.

22:05.282 --> 22:06.825
I can't wait to get rid of you.

22:07.242 --> 22:08.201
Really?

22:08.285 --> 22:11.955
Is that why we've taken,
like, 20 right turns in a row?

22:13.332 --> 22:14.750
Construction detour.

22:15.125 --> 22:16.668
You have kidnapped a woman

22:16.752 --> 22:18.712
so you can yell at her about cartoons.

22:18.795 --> 22:19.880
How dare you?

22:22.215 --> 22:23.675
-Ooh.
-That was great.

22:24.718 --> 22:28.263
Maybe not as great as, uh,
New Year's Eve '99,

22:28.347 --> 22:32.976
but it's hard to top that Y2K combination
of excitement and fear.

22:33.852 --> 22:35.312
-That was incredible.

22:35.395 --> 22:36.355
We're incredible.

22:36.438 --> 22:38.190
-Yeah.
-We're incredible together.

22:38.273 --> 22:41.401
There's nothing in here
that can compare to our history.

22:41.568 --> 22:42.694
Definitely not.

22:43.445 --> 22:44.529
So it's decided?

22:45.030 --> 22:45.989
Close it up?

22:46.073 --> 22:47.491
Close the marriage?

22:47.908 --> 22:49.117
Post a sentry?

22:49.201 --> 22:51.203
Trespassers will be shot on sight.

22:51.578 --> 22:52.746
Uh, no.

23:02.297 --> 23:04.716
Mags, I don't want this.
I don't want the open thing.

23:04.800 --> 23:08.303
Are you really okay
with being alone all year,

23:08.387 --> 23:09.888
except for eight hours?

23:11.056 --> 23:13.725
Really?
There's no one out there you wanna date?

23:16.019 --> 23:16.853
No.

23:18.230 --> 23:19.439
Was that a pause?

23:19.523 --> 23:21.691
-No. No, it wasn't a pause.
-Oh, come on!

23:21.775 --> 23:24.277
I don't wanna date anybody else, Maggie.
Just you.

23:24.361 --> 23:25.404
Okay.

23:27.489 --> 23:28.824
There someone you wanna date?

23:30.742 --> 23:33.995
I think an open marriage
could work for us.

23:35.163 --> 23:38.542
The countdown on our conventional marriage
started as soon as I got arrested.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.586
No, it didn't,
because I would wait for you forever.

23:42.087 --> 23:44.464
Because that is what I signed on for
when we got married.

23:44.881 --> 23:47.426
So both of us should suffer needlessly?

23:47.509 --> 23:48.677
What's the value in that?

23:48.760 --> 23:50.929
Look, I don't mind suffering needlessly.

23:51.012 --> 23:52.055
That's fine.

23:52.180 --> 23:53.473
-I'll be fine.

23:53.557 --> 23:55.142
You would not be fine with that?

23:55.225 --> 23:56.309
No!

23:57.686 --> 24:01.565
I'm not fine with having sex
only twice a year,

24:01.648 --> 24:04.359
and that's only when
the president allows it, by the way.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.278
It's more than twice a year.
It's two visits a year.

24:06.361 --> 24:08.363
I can have sex with you
three times each visit.

24:08.447 --> 24:09.781
That's six times.

24:09.865 --> 24:11.241
Maybe I could go for four.

24:11.324 --> 24:13.160
No, I can't do four.

24:13.243 --> 24:14.703
I could do three, though.

24:14.786 --> 24:16.204
I'd definitely go for three.

24:19.332 --> 24:20.917
Oh, boy.

24:28.008 --> 24:29.676
Everybody line up!

24:31.386 --> 24:32.429
That's us.

24:33.263 --> 24:34.848
I'll tell your mom you say "hi."

24:37.309 --> 24:38.518
Thanks for the workout.

24:39.019 --> 24:43.023
That was actually the first run
I've been on since I quit cross-country.

24:43.106 --> 24:44.483
Feels good, don't it?

24:45.859 --> 24:47.027
It's freedom.

24:48.778 --> 24:49.946
Huh.

24:50.530 --> 24:51.490
Yeah.

24:52.991 --> 24:53.825
Bye.

25:19.851 --> 25:23.230
Maggie, what kind of man
breaks his own vows?

25:24.231 --> 25:26.733
You can't just change 'em after the fact.
That's not how they work.

25:26.816 --> 25:27.859
But why not?

25:28.401 --> 25:29.736
Why not? Growing up,

25:30.111 --> 25:32.989
there are other people telling us
what's right and what's wrong.

25:33.073 --> 25:34.991
Well, we're the grow-ups now.

25:35.992 --> 25:40.622
The whole point of being faithful
is to avoid hurting the person you love.

25:41.331 --> 25:42.624
We love each other,

25:43.166 --> 25:45.752
but being faithful is hurting us.

25:48.338 --> 25:52.509
You've been such a good man for so long.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.471
You deserve to be happy.

25:59.683 --> 26:00.642
So do you.

26:03.728 --> 26:04.688
Thanks.

26:08.984 --> 26:11.278
I wanted Denver, and I got California.

26:15.282 --> 26:19.202
In three days' time,
a rocket crewed by astronauts,

26:19.286 --> 26:21.538
members of the military,

26:21.621 --> 26:24.541
and a group of world-class tradespeople

26:24.624 --> 26:26.960
will take off from this base

26:27.502 --> 26:30.589
to build an American town on the moon.

26:31.631 --> 26:34.467
We would like you both
to be on that rocket.

26:34.843 --> 26:36.219
Any questions?

26:37.721 --> 26:39.639
Which moon are we going to?

26:41.141 --> 26:43.184
The one you're familiar with.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.812
How'd you get my number? I'm unlisted.

26:46.313 --> 26:47.606
Uh, Angie's List.

26:48.773 --> 26:50.859
Are they serving dinner on the flight?

26:51.484 --> 26:52.736
Meals will be provided.

26:53.361 --> 26:54.446
-Right? Is that right?
-Yes.

26:54.529 --> 26:55.947
Meals will be provided, so...

26:56.406 --> 26:58.325
Are we expected to breed?

27:00.118 --> 27:01.202
No.

27:03.872 --> 27:04.998
Can I bring my cat?

27:05.832 --> 27:07.334
Can she bring her cat?

27:07.417 --> 27:08.418
-Come on.
-No.

27:08.501 --> 27:09.502
-Sorry.
-No.

27:09.586 --> 27:13.089
If we are required to breed,
do I have a choice?

27:13.757 --> 27:14.716
Is it her?

27:15.175 --> 27:16.134
That's a great question.

27:16.217 --> 27:18.803
He's saying if they have to have sex,
could it be her?

27:18.887 --> 27:21.097
-He could be into it.
-I understood. Thank you.

27:21.640 --> 27:26.019
Uh, if it will be required,
you will be given a choice, yes.

27:27.312 --> 27:29.064
I get an hour for lunch.

27:29.522 --> 27:30.523
Understood.

27:30.857 --> 27:32.942
When is Christmas on the moon?

27:33.943 --> 27:35.862
It's the usual time.

27:36.363 --> 27:38.073
After Christmas Eve.

27:38.657 --> 27:39.699
Werewolves.

27:40.241 --> 27:45.789
Have you addressed the possible hazard
of werewolves on the moon,

27:45.872 --> 27:48.750
in their prime environment?

27:49.376 --> 27:52.879
I understand that you can grow
up to two inches on the moon.

27:53.505 --> 27:55.173
Is that in all directions?

28:13.358 --> 28:14.192
So...

28:14.901 --> 28:16.695
...what should we tell people?

28:17.570 --> 28:18.780
Whatever we want.

28:18.988 --> 28:20.365
We make the rules.

28:21.741 --> 28:23.702
Never made my own rules before.

28:24.661 --> 28:25.620
Sounds like fun.

28:25.704 --> 28:26.705
It is.

28:27.038 --> 28:27.956
Let's go.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.208
Oh, shoot, I gotta get in line.

28:47.016 --> 28:51.146
<i>âªÂ Oh, I could hide beneath the wingsÂ âª</i>

28:51.438 --> 28:55.525
<i>âªÂ Of the bluebird as she singsÂ âª</i>

28:56.151 --> 29:00.697
<i>âªÂ TheÂ six-o'clock alarm</i>
<i>Would never ring âª</i>

29:02.949 --> 29:06.703
<i>âªÂ But six rings and I riseÂ âª</i>

29:06.786 --> 29:10.081
<i>âªÂ Wipe the sleep out of my eyesÂ âª</i>

29:11.458 --> 29:16.880
<i>âªÂ TheÂ shaving razor's cold</i>
<i>And it stings âª</i>

29:19.090 --> 29:20.091
Dad!

29:20.383 --> 29:21.551
What the fuck?

29:21.885 --> 29:25.221
<i>âªÂ Cheer up, sleepy JeanÂ âª</i>

29:25.722 --> 29:28.433
<i>âªÂ Oh, what can it meanÂ âª</i>

29:28.516 --> 29:32.228
<i>âª To a daydream believerÂ âª</i>

29:32.312 --> 29:37.567
<i>âª And a homecoming queen? âª</i>

29:39.152 --> 29:46.075
<i>âªÂ You once thought of me</i>
<i>As a white knight on his steedÂ âª</i>

29:46.785 --> 29:51.581
<i>âªÂ Now you know how happy I can beÂ âª</i>

29:53.124 --> 29:56.920
<i>âªÂ Oh, and our good times</i>
<i>Starts and endÂ âª</i>

29:57.295 --> 30:01.174
<i>âªÂ Without dollar one to spendÂ âª</i>

30:01.841 --> 30:06.888
<i>âª ButÂ how much, baby</i>
<i>Do we really need? âª</i>

30:09.682 --> 30:12.852
<i>âªÂ Cheer up, sleepy JeanÂ âª</i>

30:13.353 --> 30:16.064
<i>âªÂ Oh, what can it meanÂ âª</i>

30:16.147 --> 30:19.609
<i>âª ToÂ a daydream believerÂ âª</i>

30:19.692 --> 30:25.615
<i>âª And a homecoming queen? âª</i>

30:26.825 --> 30:30.161
<i>âªÂ Cheer up, sleepy JeanÂ âª</i>

30:30.662 --> 30:33.623
<i>âªÂ Oh, what can it meanÂ âª</i>

30:33.706 --> 30:37.085
<i>âª ToÂ a daydream believerÂ âª</i>

30:37.168 --> 30:43.216
<i>âª And a homecoming queen? âª</i>

30:44.050 --> 30:47.387
<i>âªÂ Cheer up, sleepy JeanÂ âª</i>

30:47.887 --> 30:50.598
<i>âªÂ Oh, what can it meanÂ âª</i>

30:50.849 --> 30:54.477
<i>âª ToÂ a daydream believerÂ âª</i>

30:54.561 --> 30:58.690
<i>âª And a homecoming queen? âª</i>
