00:17.283 --> 00:19.603
Dads <i>is recorded in front</i>
<i>of a live studio audience.</i>

00:22.822 --> 00:24.890
(David groans)

00:27.127 --> 00:29.128
(groans)

00:29.130 --> 00:30.129
God.

00:30.131 --> 00:31.797
Was that a ghost?

00:31.799 --> 00:33.298
Hopefully soon.

00:33.300 --> 00:35.100
(David groans)

00:36.136 --> 00:39.671
I'm not looking.
I'm not looking.

00:39.673 --> 00:40.973
Ah, a brunette.

00:40.975 --> 00:41.874
I'm not looking.

00:41.876 --> 00:43.976
Not looking.

00:43.978 --> 00:45.377
Dad!

00:45.379 --> 00:47.479
What are you doing?
I got to use the bathroom.

00:47.481 --> 00:48.981
Why don't you use
the one upstairs?

00:48.983 --> 00:51.550
Upstairs is for liquids only.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.218
Why do you always do this?

00:53.220 --> 00:55.521
Always? How many girls
do you have up here?

00:55.523 --> 00:57.990
A ton.

00:57.992 --> 00:59.825
Ew, gross.

00:59.827 --> 01:00.826
I'm out of here.

01:00.828 --> 01:02.161
No. Oh, come on,
don't leave.

01:02.163 --> 01:04.329
Where are you going?
It's San Francisco.

01:04.331 --> 01:07.599
Be happy he's
into you and not me.

01:09.035 --> 01:10.335
Thanks, Dad.

01:10.337 --> 01:11.570
You satisfied?

01:11.572 --> 01:13.939
I will be in 45 minutes.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.241
I had cheese with every meal.

01:16.243 --> 01:18.777
I'm in for a fight.

01:22.382 --> 01:25.350
¶ Daddy took me to the zoo

01:25.352 --> 01:27.419
¶ <i>Na, na, na, na</i> ¶

01:27.421 --> 01:31.390
¶ Just to see
something brand-new ¶

01:31.392 --> 01:33.525
¶ <i>Na, na, na</i> ¶

01:33.527 --> 01:37.696
¶ So many stars up in the sky

01:37.698 --> 01:42.201
¶ So many questions have I

01:42.203 --> 01:44.369
¶ <i>Na, na, na, na</i> ¶

01:44.371 --> 01:47.139
¶ Daddy took me for a ride.

01:50.043 --> 01:52.377
Oh, hey, um, have you found
someone to do the voice

01:52.379 --> 01:53.545
for the Wall Street game?

01:53.547 --> 01:54.746
Just, uh, get the guy.

01:54.748 --> 01:56.915
Uh, Doug Henderson.
He always does it.

01:56.917 --> 01:58.584
Uh, not anymore.
He's in prison.

01:58.586 --> 01:59.785
What?

01:59.787 --> 02:01.086
He was the East Bay Strangler.

02:01.088 --> 02:02.387
He killed like eight people.

02:02.389 --> 02:06.125
You know, he was always
talking about East Bay

02:06.127 --> 02:08.694
and strangling, but I never
put the two together.

02:11.064 --> 02:12.764
Oh, boy.

02:12.766 --> 02:14.399
I know that face.

02:14.401 --> 02:18.103
That's the "I put the time in
but didn't get laid" face.

02:18.105 --> 02:20.105
Hey, buddy.

02:20.107 --> 02:21.640
What's the matter?

02:21.642 --> 02:25.077
I put the time in,
I didn't get laid.

02:25.079 --> 02:28.480
You know, Eli, there's more
to life than intercourse.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.782
You know, some of us
actually enjoy sex.

02:30.784 --> 02:32.284
We don't only use it
for procreation.

02:32.286 --> 02:33.952
Hey, both my kids
were drunken mistakes.

02:33.954 --> 02:35.954
Thank you very much.

02:35.956 --> 02:38.790
You're quietly
a terrible person.

02:38.792 --> 02:39.925
I know.

02:39.927 --> 02:41.093
Well, the point is,

02:41.095 --> 02:42.594
as long as my dad's
living with me,

02:42.596 --> 02:44.096
I'll never be able
to have sex again.

02:44.098 --> 02:46.165
Aw, that's too bad,
because Anne's single.

02:46.167 --> 02:47.599
Anne?
Your hot blonde friend?

02:47.601 --> 02:48.934
Mm-hmm.
What happened to her boyfriend?

02:48.936 --> 02:50.602
Ugh. He broke up with her.

02:50.604 --> 02:52.771
What? Why would you
break up with that?

02:52.773 --> 02:53.839
Well, she's a comic.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.507
She's always doing
some tiresome bits.

02:55.509 --> 02:58.477
Oh, boy, here we go.

02:58.479 --> 03:00.345
Look at the green-eyed
monster of jealousy

03:00.347 --> 03:01.780
rearing its head.

03:01.782 --> 03:02.781
Extra, extra!

03:02.783 --> 03:03.782
Girl denigrates
attractive friend.

03:03.784 --> 03:04.950
Paper, mister?

03:04.952 --> 03:05.984
Why, sure, I'll
take one of those.

03:05.986 --> 03:07.152
Shame about those girls.

03:07.154 --> 03:08.954
What's this?
Roosevelt has polio?

03:08.956 --> 03:11.190
Oh, boy!

03:13.626 --> 03:15.460
Yeah, tiresome.

03:15.462 --> 03:16.995
What do I care?

03:16.997 --> 03:18.964
My penis doesn't have ears.

03:18.966 --> 03:21.633
I'm deaf!

03:21.635 --> 03:24.136
It's hard being deaf!

03:24.138 --> 03:26.505
Life is so hard!

03:26.507 --> 03:29.107
Where are you going?
I still got...

03:59.172 --> 04:01.240
(vacuum whirring)

04:08.014 --> 04:10.716
Hey, Dad, great news.

04:10.718 --> 04:12.517
You are going out tonight.

04:12.519 --> 04:13.518
Really? Where?

04:13.520 --> 04:15.254
I don't care.

04:16.222 --> 04:17.522
I need to be able to have sex

04:17.524 --> 04:18.523
in my own apartment.

04:18.525 --> 04:19.858
So, go ahead.

04:19.860 --> 04:22.861
People have been having sex
around me my whole life.

04:22.863 --> 04:25.030
My nickname in college was

04:25.032 --> 04:26.498
"Sleeps Through It" Sachs.

04:27.934 --> 04:31.937
Of course, after I was married,
your mother took that name.

04:35.875 --> 04:38.110
Look, I-I have a date tonight.

04:38.112 --> 04:40.045
And I don't want it screwed up.
Who is she?

04:40.047 --> 04:41.880
Veronica's
recently-single friend.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.882
Oh, a rebound.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.384
You want my advice?

04:45.386 --> 04:47.219
You've never been right
about anything.

04:47.221 --> 04:48.220
Not true.

04:48.222 --> 04:49.388
When you were four,

04:49.390 --> 04:51.757
I told you there was
no Santa Claus.

04:51.759 --> 04:54.326
You cried and cried,
but I was right.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.229
No Santa?

04:57.231 --> 04:59.064
ELI:
Uh...

04:59.066 --> 05:01.099
No, Edna, there's...
of course there's a Santa Claus.

05:01.101 --> 05:03.535
Of course there's Santa.

05:05.972 --> 05:08.140
Look, tonight, when I come home
with this girl,

05:08.142 --> 05:10.909
you're gonna suddenly remember
that you have somewhere to go.

05:10.911 --> 05:12.744
And then here's the
most important part...

05:12.746 --> 05:15.080
you go.

05:15.082 --> 05:16.081
Go where?

05:16.083 --> 05:17.582
I don't know, go to, like,

05:17.584 --> 05:19.084
the movies or
something. Here.

05:19.086 --> 05:22.554
And I should starve to death?

05:25.925 --> 05:29.494
And what happens when I
storm out of the first movie?

05:30.296 --> 05:31.697
(groans)

05:33.599 --> 05:36.668
What if the second movie
has singing?

05:39.105 --> 05:41.106
EDNA:
Okay, I finish.

05:41.108 --> 05:43.175
Thank you.

05:46.145 --> 05:48.013
Hey.
Oh, hey.

05:48.015 --> 05:50.115
Why... why are you
finger-painting?

05:50.117 --> 05:51.983
It's for Alden's class project.

05:51.985 --> 05:53.985
Oh, well, shouldn't he
be doing that?

05:53.987 --> 05:56.688
Well, you know,
he has no sense of scale,

05:56.690 --> 05:58.657
and I'm just not letting
those skinny-ass,

05:58.659 --> 06:00.992
blonde-bitch moms stare down
their Meg Ryan duck lips

06:00.994 --> 06:03.528
at this <i>chica.</i>

06:03.530 --> 06:05.964
Oh, I love it
when you get ethnic.

06:05.966 --> 06:07.132
How was work, baby?

06:07.134 --> 06:09.000
It was okay,
but we're running behind

06:09.002 --> 06:10.869
on our Wall Street game.
I can't find

06:10.871 --> 06:13.805
a single voice actor
who sounds like a businessman.

06:13.807 --> 06:15.140
All right, yeah.

06:15.142 --> 06:18.009
25% down now,
and the balance on delivery.

06:18.011 --> 06:19.978
Mm-hmm, we got a deal.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.714
I'll take two boxes
of the mint cookies, Kimmy.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.983
CAMILA:
Honey,

06:24.985 --> 06:27.386
you should let your dad do
the voice in your new videogame.

06:27.388 --> 06:28.687
What? What's that?
What was that?

06:28.689 --> 06:29.988
I just blacked
out for a second.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.690
No, this is great.

06:31.692 --> 06:33.992
Warner wants you
to voice a businessman

06:33.994 --> 06:35.861
in his new game.

06:35.863 --> 06:38.463
Well, is this so?

06:39.899 --> 06:42.000
Mint cookies, huh? Mmm.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.902
Well, I'm very
flattered, Warner,

06:43.904 --> 06:47.005
but I'm not gonna sign anything
until I read the contract first.

06:47.007 --> 06:50.409
I learned that the hard
way with Not-C tutoring.

06:51.711 --> 06:54.012
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
What the hell is that?

06:54.014 --> 06:56.014
It was an educational course
for kids.
Mm-hmm.

06:56.016 --> 06:58.850
"A's and B's, but never a C.

06:58.852 --> 07:01.412
That's the Not-C
guarantee."

07:03.022 --> 07:05.056
We had to move to Holland
for two years

07:05.058 --> 07:06.057
while things cooled off.

07:06.059 --> 07:08.460
My Dutch name
was Petr Vanderhozen.

07:10.530 --> 07:12.697
Fell, like, 50 feet. I didn't
think I'd even survive.

07:12.699 --> 07:13.865
Hey, Dad.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.901
What are you doing here?
I thought you were

07:15.903 --> 07:17.269
busy tonight.

07:17.271 --> 07:22.374
Oh, right. I suddenly remember,
I have that thing.

07:22.376 --> 07:25.877
Well, listen, before
you definitely leave,

07:25.879 --> 07:27.112
let me introduce you

07:27.114 --> 07:28.914
to Anne.
Anne, this is my dad.

07:28.916 --> 07:30.415
It's nice to meet
you, Mr. Sachs.

07:30.417 --> 07:31.616
Ow!

07:31.618 --> 07:33.919
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

07:33.921 --> 07:35.720
J-Kidsky. I'm fine.

07:35.722 --> 07:37.956
(laughs)

07:37.958 --> 07:40.459
Anne's a comedian.
She's funny, huh?

07:45.431 --> 07:47.499
Ha-choo.

07:49.268 --> 07:50.902
Uh, what-what
are you doing?

07:50.904 --> 07:53.071
Staying in. I think
I'm coming down with something.

07:53.073 --> 07:54.906
Eli, put on your
mask, you fool!

07:54.908 --> 07:56.074
The virus is spreading!

07:56.076 --> 07:58.343
Hashtag, contagion.

07:59.912 --> 08:02.981
Ha-choo.

08:09.822 --> 08:11.790
EDNA:
Morning, Eli.

08:11.792 --> 08:12.757
How you sleep?

08:12.759 --> 08:15.760
Alone.

08:15.762 --> 08:17.462
Can I get you anything?

08:17.464 --> 08:18.997
Yes, as a matter of fact.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.765
You can get my dad to understand

08:20.767 --> 08:23.435
that when we make a deal,
he has to stick to it.

08:23.437 --> 08:25.003
Okay.

08:28.107 --> 08:31.009
Uh, Mr. David? Um...

08:31.011 --> 08:34.012
Uh, Eli say, uh... he...

08:34.014 --> 08:35.780
(mutters in Spanish) He, um...

08:35.782 --> 08:36.982
um...

08:36.984 --> 08:39.951
to say to you, why...

08:39.953 --> 08:42.020
Okay, we're not doing this.

08:45.958 --> 08:47.792
Why didn't you
leave last night?

08:47.794 --> 08:48.994
I saved you.

08:48.996 --> 08:50.128
That girl was a nightmare.

08:50.130 --> 08:51.663
Eli,

08:51.665 --> 08:52.998
your father has some skills.

08:53.000 --> 08:53.965
I know women.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.300
No, you don't.

08:55.302 --> 08:57.435
You created three lesbians.

08:58.971 --> 09:00.872
In their '50s.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.874
Those were great relationships.

09:02.876 --> 09:05.010
I'm wearing Margaret's

09:05.012 --> 09:06.878
old jeans now.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.948
This is where
she used to keep her hammer.

09:13.819 --> 09:15.487
You know nothing about Anne.

09:15.489 --> 09:17.889
I also know nothing
about bone cancer,

09:17.891 --> 09:21.059
but I know
I don't want it in the house.

09:22.328 --> 09:25.163
You made a snap judgment
the way you always do.

09:25.165 --> 09:27.732
Anne is gorgeous,
and at least she's not boring.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.668
Trust me, you'll pray
for boring.

09:29.670 --> 09:30.702
Remember,

09:30.704 --> 09:32.971
Joan Rivers' husband
killed himself.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.075
Well, she's single.
You should give her a call.

09:38.010 --> 09:40.245
Hey, Edna,

09:40.247 --> 09:42.047
you have kids?
<i>Sí.</i>

09:42.049 --> 09:44.516
Well, just you wait
until they're his age.

09:44.518 --> 09:46.217
They are. My oldest...

09:46.219 --> 09:48.019
she 41.

09:48.021 --> 09:49.220
Really?

09:49.222 --> 09:51.089
How old are you?

09:51.091 --> 09:53.592
I no like to talk about.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.698
This is a real
recording studio.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.199
Wow!

10:01.201 --> 10:03.068
Let's test the microphone,

10:03.070 --> 10:05.203
see if it works.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.238
One, two, three, four,

10:07.240 --> 10:08.707
five, six, seven, eight...

10:08.709 --> 10:10.241
Uh, Dad, you only
test to three.
...nine, ten,

10:10.243 --> 10:11.242
11, 12.

10:11.244 --> 10:12.944
Dad, stop.
The quick brown fox

10:12.946 --> 10:13.946
jumped over the lazy dog.

10:13.947 --> 10:14.947
Okay, that's typing, Dad.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.247
The quick brown fox...

10:16.249 --> 10:18.583
Okay, we're good
with the mic check, Dad!

10:18.585 --> 10:19.918
Are we good?

10:19.920 --> 10:21.052
Yeah, we're good.

10:21.054 --> 10:23.121
(chuckling):
Yeah, okay.

10:25.791 --> 10:28.460
Yeah. No.

10:32.064 --> 10:34.633
So, it turns out my dad
ruined my date on purpose.

10:34.635 --> 10:36.735
He thinks he's saving me
from a disaster.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.103
What kind of disaster?

10:38.105 --> 10:39.938
Well, he thinks
Anne's comedy is horrible

10:39.940 --> 10:41.439
and I'll wind up killing myself.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.441
Oh, you mean
like Joan Rivers' husband?

10:43.443 --> 10:45.244
Yeah.
Well, your dad's right.

10:45.245 --> 10:46.444
She's awful.

10:46.446 --> 10:48.480
I thought she was your friend.

10:48.482 --> 10:51.042
Yeah, she's one of
my best friends.

10:51.817 --> 10:53.151
Well, the point is,
he's preventing me

10:53.153 --> 10:54.753
from having sex
in my own place.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.788
Okay, why don't you just go
to her place?

10:56.790 --> 10:59.290
No way. I'm way better
at home than on the road.

10:59.292 --> 11:01.292
Crowd's on my side.

11:01.294 --> 11:03.261
Wait. The crowd?

11:03.263 --> 11:05.797
Yeah, the crowd
I imagine cheering me on.

11:05.799 --> 11:07.832
Am I in the crowd?

11:07.834 --> 11:08.967
No, you're not in the crowd.

11:08.969 --> 11:10.168
Ew, that's disgusting!

11:10.170 --> 11:11.169
What?

11:11.171 --> 11:12.671
Oh, now I'm just gonna be

11:12.673 --> 11:14.172
picturing you in the crowd.

11:14.174 --> 11:15.940
CRAWFORD:
I assume it's
all right

11:15.942 --> 11:17.275
to smoke cigars in here.

11:17.277 --> 11:18.977
Oh, my God!

11:18.979 --> 11:20.278
Okay, look.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.480
Put it out.
Put it out.

11:22.482 --> 11:24.749
Put it out!
Wh...

11:27.486 --> 11:30.655
(New York accent):
So, it's a one-bed,
one-bath fixer-upper,

11:30.657 --> 11:33.124
all new stainless
steel appliances.

11:33.126 --> 11:36.127
(inhales, exhales)
Are you single, hon?

11:36.129 --> 11:37.128
(laughs)

11:37.130 --> 11:39.130
Your jokes
were so funny tonight.

11:39.132 --> 11:42.033
All those other tables
were wrong to complain.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.868
I know!
They were all like,

11:43.870 --> 11:46.705
(à la Pee-wee Herman):
"We're trying to eat!"

11:46.707 --> 11:48.139
You know, you don't...

11:48.141 --> 11:50.975
you don't have to always do
funny characters.

11:50.977 --> 11:53.712
I like you just the way you are.

11:53.714 --> 11:56.014
I had a really great time
with you tonight, Eli.

11:56.016 --> 11:58.983
Thank you for
letting me be myself.

11:58.985 --> 12:00.552
I, uh...

12:00.554 --> 12:02.220
I really like you.

12:03.522 --> 12:05.590
(chuckles)

12:10.029 --> 12:11.863
(Southern accent):
Oh, my.

12:11.865 --> 12:13.498
I do declare.

12:13.500 --> 12:16.668
Let us away to the boudoir.

12:16.670 --> 12:21.906
I have always depended
upon the penises of strangers.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.976
Hey, do you have
a mute whore character?

12:27.913 --> 12:29.881
Back off, peasants!

12:29.883 --> 12:32.250
That's my oil!

12:32.252 --> 12:33.918
Dad, that's really great.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.887
You sound
like a real businessman.

12:35.889 --> 12:38.022
I know! It's crazy.

12:38.024 --> 12:39.090
You almost done?

12:39.092 --> 12:41.059
Yeah. We might have
to boil the microphone,

12:41.061 --> 12:42.193
but, other than that,
it's great.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.361
You know, Warner,

12:43.363 --> 12:45.864
some of these lines
almost make it sound

12:45.866 --> 12:48.032
like the businessmen
are the bad guys.

12:48.034 --> 12:49.200
Well, yeah, Dad,

12:49.202 --> 12:51.035
the object of the game
is to actually

12:51.037 --> 12:54.806
decapitate as many heartless,
greedy businessmen as possible.

12:56.041 --> 12:57.108
Or you can castrate them.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.910
It's player's choice.

12:58.912 --> 13:00.912
Oh, my God.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.247
Well, I'm sorry.

13:02.249 --> 13:04.082
I can't do this.

13:04.084 --> 13:08.119
Wall Street put me
where I am today.

13:08.121 --> 13:11.456
Dad, you sleep on my sofa bed.

13:11.458 --> 13:12.957
Well, not anymore.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.893
I'm sleeping here now.

13:14.895 --> 13:17.061
(lock clicks)
Wait, Dad, what are you...

13:17.063 --> 13:19.130
what are you doing?
Wait. Okay.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.131
Uh...

13:20.133 --> 13:21.232
Dad, what are you doing?

13:21.234 --> 13:23.768
Those hippies occupied
Wall Street.

13:23.770 --> 13:27.138
Well, I'm gonna occupy
this booth.

13:27.140 --> 13:30.074
Oh, come on. You're not gonna
last 20 minutes in there.

13:30.076 --> 13:31.976
You don't even have anything
to eat.

13:31.978 --> 13:34.579
Ham and cheese.

13:34.581 --> 13:36.314
You don't have anything
to drink.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.449
Ah...

13:38.451 --> 13:41.452
You... you don't have a toilet.

13:41.454 --> 13:43.388
Ah...

13:48.961 --> 13:49.961
Good date?

13:49.963 --> 13:51.262
Great date.

13:51.264 --> 13:53.264
I see you didn't spend
the night.

13:53.266 --> 13:54.933
We are taking it slow.

13:54.935 --> 13:56.134
Let me guess.

13:56.136 --> 14:00.271
She Robin Williams'd you
to impotence.

14:00.273 --> 14:02.106
The opposite.

14:02.108 --> 14:05.443
I Seinfeld't her up.

14:05.445 --> 14:08.012
Wow, sounds like
a great relationship.

14:08.014 --> 14:09.681
Definitely.

14:09.683 --> 14:12.483
You know, I don't throw around
the term "soul mate" a lot...

14:12.485 --> 14:14.552
Finish the thought.

14:16.655 --> 14:18.790
But when you know, you know.

14:18.792 --> 14:20.124
You really like her that much?

14:20.126 --> 14:21.860
Yeah, actually,
I think I love her.

14:21.862 --> 14:23.962
I guess I was wrong.
Sounds like you're serious.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.029
Damn straight, I'm serious.

14:25.031 --> 14:26.297
Maybe you should have her
move in.

14:26.299 --> 14:27.832
Maybe I will. Wait, what?

14:27.834 --> 14:28.833
Well,

14:28.835 --> 14:30.134
since you're so smitten,

14:30.136 --> 14:33.137
maybe you should take it
to the next step.

14:33.139 --> 14:34.973
Unless...

14:34.975 --> 14:36.674
you think I'm right about her.

14:36.676 --> 14:38.476
Oh, we will take it
to the next step.

14:38.478 --> 14:39.677
I'm-I'm gonna...

14:39.679 --> 14:41.479
I'll call her right now.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.047
Oh.

14:43.049 --> 14:44.382
M-My battery's dead.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.950
(phone rings)

14:47.152 --> 14:48.820
H-Hello?

14:48.822 --> 14:52.323
Uh, sorry, I don't know
Ivana Pinchaloaf.

14:52.325 --> 14:55.026
Oh, hi, Anne.
(chuckles)

14:55.028 --> 14:56.027
(quietly):
It's Anne.

14:56.029 --> 14:57.228
Yeah. Um,
I was actually

14:57.230 --> 14:58.897
just about to call you.

14:58.899 --> 15:02.667
Listen, um, I know
this is fast...

15:02.669 --> 15:04.068
(chuckles) Sh...

15:04.070 --> 15:06.170
She's doing Speedy Gonzales.

15:06.172 --> 15:08.039
Right.

15:08.041 --> 15:10.341
I... Anyway, I-I know,
but, um...

15:10.343 --> 15:12.210
I was th... I was thinking...

15:12.212 --> 15:14.712
you know, things are going
really great, and...

15:14.714 --> 15:18.516
m-maybe... well,
maybe you would want to...

15:18.518 --> 15:20.585
uh, like...

15:22.888 --> 15:26.357
move in with me.

15:26.359 --> 15:27.692
(chuckling):
Oh, yeah.

15:27.694 --> 15:29.694
I suppose it is an
offer you can't refuse.

15:29.696 --> 15:32.256
Killer Godfather impression.

15:34.033 --> 15:36.034
Yes. Well, that's great.

15:36.036 --> 15:38.596
Great. Sounds great.
Okay. Bye.

15:39.238 --> 15:40.538
So?

15:40.540 --> 15:42.040
Well, her lease is up,

15:42.042 --> 15:43.608
so it actually
times out perfectly.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.410
Congratulations.

15:45.412 --> 15:48.079
And since I know
you love impressions,

15:48.081 --> 15:51.449
here's an impression
of you in a week.

15:53.552 --> 15:56.554
(yelling)

15:56.556 --> 16:00.024
"My dad was right!"

16:01.126 --> 16:03.027
Sidewalk!

16:10.436 --> 16:12.403
She's moving in?
Yep, as we speak.

16:12.405 --> 16:14.405
I saw her carrying
two big boxes

16:14.407 --> 16:16.841
marked "wigs, teeth."

16:18.744 --> 16:20.745
Why are you doing this?

16:20.747 --> 16:22.480
Well, I was just trying
to prove my dad wrong,

16:22.482 --> 16:24.082
and the whole thing
got out of hand.

16:24.084 --> 16:26.117
But I figure, all I have to do
is stick with her

16:26.119 --> 16:27.785
for, like, 30 years

16:27.787 --> 16:30.722
and then he'll die
and I will win.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.925
But I always thought
we'd get married.

16:33.927 --> 16:34.926
R-Really?

16:34.928 --> 16:36.494
J-Kidsky.

16:37.930 --> 16:40.498
BARACK OBAMA:
Everyone in this room

16:40.500 --> 16:43.267
knows what will happen
if we do nothing.
Just stop it!

16:43.269 --> 16:45.436
Our deficit will grow.
Not true!

16:45.438 --> 16:47.939
More families
will go bankrupt.
Just stop it!

16:47.941 --> 16:48.973
More businesses will close.

16:48.975 --> 16:50.975
You know, you're not gonna
scare me out of here

16:50.977 --> 16:52.443
with this rap music!

16:52.445 --> 16:56.481
That was Barack Obama
with "Health Care Blues."

16:56.483 --> 16:59.117
Now here's a little ditty
from our friend Al Gore

16:59.119 --> 17:02.186
called "I Created the Internet"!

17:02.188 --> 17:04.856
AL GORE:
I took the initiative
in creating the Internet...

17:04.858 --> 17:06.657
¶ Ronald Reagan

17:06.659 --> 17:08.659
¶ Ronald Reagan
(blows raspberry)

17:08.661 --> 17:10.528
¶ Ronald Reagan

17:10.530 --> 17:11.996
¶ Ronald Reagan (groans)

17:11.998 --> 17:15.133
Honey, I figured out a way
to get us out of this.

17:15.135 --> 17:16.300
Hi, Crawford.

17:16.302 --> 17:17.668
Hi.

17:17.670 --> 17:20.004
There's someone
here to see you.

17:20.006 --> 17:21.172
Huh?

17:21.174 --> 17:22.340
Kimmy?

17:22.342 --> 17:24.642
I have your cookies,
Mr. Whittemore.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.544
CAMILA:
Kimmy has your cookies.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.046
You made a deal
with her, Crawford.

17:28.048 --> 17:30.815
You have to come out
and honor it.

17:30.817 --> 17:32.683
It was an oral contract.

17:32.685 --> 17:34.986
It'll never hold up in court.

17:34.988 --> 17:37.355
Do you really want
little Kimmy here to think

17:37.357 --> 17:40.558
all businessmen are liar, liar,
pants on fire?!

17:40.560 --> 17:42.060
Is that true?

17:42.062 --> 17:43.694
Yes, Kimmy.

17:43.696 --> 17:46.764
I'm afraid it's "twue."

17:47.699 --> 17:49.133
No, it isn't.

17:50.169 --> 17:52.170
Kimmy,

17:52.172 --> 17:56.340
businesspeople
are good, honest people.

17:56.342 --> 17:58.576
And their pants
are never on fire.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.011
(chuckles)

18:00.013 --> 18:01.746
Thank you.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.347
Uh, no, no, no, no.

18:03.349 --> 18:04.482
These are not mint.

18:05.350 --> 18:06.851
These are the Aloha-has.

18:06.853 --> 18:07.919
I'm allergic to coconut.

18:07.921 --> 18:09.854
I'm sorry, I can't pay you.

18:09.856 --> 18:12.023
This is not what we agreed to.

18:12.025 --> 18:13.357
Where's my money?!

18:13.359 --> 18:15.526
Ow!

18:15.528 --> 18:16.594
How dare you kick

18:16.596 --> 18:18.362
a businessman!
(Kimmy grunts)

18:18.364 --> 18:20.098
We built this country!

18:20.100 --> 18:21.899
Oh, this is great.
I got to record this.
I'll sue you!

18:21.901 --> 18:23.234
Keep kicking him, Kimmy!

18:23.236 --> 18:25.403
This is a place of business!

18:25.405 --> 18:27.071
You're trespassing

18:27.073 --> 18:31.042
on private property,
you little parasite!

18:31.044 --> 18:33.211
Warner, I think she's
really hurting him.

18:33.213 --> 18:35.046
Oh, that's okay.
He's a grown man.

18:35.048 --> 18:36.414
She's a little girl.

18:36.416 --> 18:39.083
Put down the briefcase, Kimmy.

18:39.085 --> 18:40.384
Uh-oh.

18:40.386 --> 18:41.752
(Kimmy grunts) Uh...

18:41.754 --> 18:43.121
Oh!

18:45.057 --> 18:47.558
Well, that's the last of it.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.594
We are officially
living together.

18:49.596 --> 18:51.429
Honey, it's not what you think!

18:51.431 --> 18:54.899
Please don't use me
in your skits.

18:54.901 --> 18:56.067
(groans)

18:56.069 --> 18:58.903
Him Big Chief Need-A-Laugh.

18:58.905 --> 19:01.672
(chanting)

19:14.419 --> 19:15.486
Well,

19:15.488 --> 19:17.421
I have got to unpack.

19:17.423 --> 19:19.323
Porter, my bags! All aboard!

19:19.325 --> 19:20.825
Next stop, Steubenville!

19:20.827 --> 19:22.760
(chugging)

19:22.762 --> 19:24.962
Now passing Old Stone Face.

19:24.964 --> 19:27.098
(chugging)

19:27.100 --> 19:30.201
Do they make tampons
for your mouth?

19:33.772 --> 19:35.106
I don't know
what you're talking about.

19:35.108 --> 19:36.941
I think this is really
gonna be great.

19:36.943 --> 19:38.276
You do, do you?

19:38.278 --> 19:41.979
There's a woman in your bedroom
acting like a locomotive.

19:41.981 --> 19:44.115
Come on, Dad, it's not that bad.

19:44.117 --> 19:46.851
What is the deal
with memory foam pillows?

19:46.853 --> 19:48.653
Does it remember my head?
Because, if so,

19:48.655 --> 19:51.122
every time I lay down,
it should say, "Hello, Anne."

19:51.124 --> 19:55.026
I think my memory foam pillow
has Alzheimer's...

19:55.028 --> 19:57.895
Good night! Thank you!
Drive safe!

20:14.980 --> 20:16.347
Okay, you were right.

20:16.349 --> 20:17.815
Help me, Daddy.

20:17.817 --> 20:21.252
(crying):
Please make the bad lady
go away.

20:37.502 --> 20:39.503
When did you learn
to hypnotize people?

20:39.505 --> 20:41.706
You stow away
on a Carnival cruise ship,

20:41.708 --> 20:42.940
you learn some things.

20:45.677 --> 20:48.379
I got to admit, Dad,
you were right about her.

20:48.381 --> 20:49.914
I guess it wouldn't hurt to...

20:49.916 --> 20:51.749
listen to you
every once in a while.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.952
That's the nicest thing
you've said since I moved in.

20:56.021 --> 20:57.688
Give me a hug.

20:57.690 --> 21:00.057
(horn honks)

21:00.059 --> 21:02.426
See?

21:02.428 --> 21:05.096
Your old man still knows a thing
or two about relationships.

21:05.098 --> 21:08.532
(chuckles) Edna, no prints.

21:08.534 --> 21:11.335
This no Edna's first rodeo.

21:13.905 --> 21:15.973
(elevator dings)

21:21.913 --> 21:23.214
We'll take the next one.

21:23.216 --> 21:25.783
No, no, no. We'll squeeze in.

21:25.785 --> 21:29.053
(horn honks)

21:29.055 --> 21:32.123
Okay...
(grunting)

21:33.592 --> 21:35.059
Can you hit, uh, "garage"?

21:35.061 --> 21:36.060
Yeah.
Yeah.

21:36.062 --> 21:37.061
Thanks.
Okay.

21:37.063 --> 21:39.063
How was your day? Good.
Good.
