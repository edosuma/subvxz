And the Hudsons want Laura
out of the picture

her sister's estate.

12:41.543 --> 12:44.372
We went to a medium to see what
she wanted, and then the medium

12:44.415 --> 12:46.417
freaked and vanished.

12:46.461 --> 12:48.811
Not like mystical vanished.
She just, like, skipped town.

12:48.855 --> 12:52.684
Right. Then there was
this '70s throwback lady

12:52.728 --> 12:55.383
who applied for a job
during the Nor'Easter storm.

12:55.426 --> 12:56.950
She also might've been dead,
not sure.

possessed George.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.530
with a crash course
from Victoria.

13:12.574 --> 13:14.924
My mom's a clairvoyant. It's why
she's a raging alcoholic.

What does this
have to do with Ace?

13:16.621 --> 13:18.798
You all have been reckless.

13:18.841 --> 13:21.626
This place is still cluttered
with spirits,

13:21.670 --> 13:23.541
even worse than the hospital.

13:23.585 --> 13:26.457
So you did see something
at the hospital? What was it?

McGINNIS:
He's not dead.

13:39.035 --> 13:41.516
He's lost, scared.

13:41.559 --> 13:43.431
The trauma of the crash,

13:43.474 --> 13:45.737
it dislodged his soul
from his body.

13:45.781 --> 13:47.783
Well, how do we get it back
into his body?

13:47.827 --> 13:49.654
If Ace is lost
in the spirit world,

13:49.698 --> 13:52.744
he's frozen in the moment
of his greatest fear.

13:52.788 --> 13:54.529
What, the-the car wreck?

13:54.572 --> 13:56.748
Then we'll have to go after him ourselves.
Yeah.

13:56.792 --> 14:00.404
NANCY: George has channeled
a spirit before and I've

14:00.448 --> 14:03.625
made contact,
so is there a way together

14:03.668 --> 14:06.280
that we can bring Ace back?

14:06.323 --> 14:09.370
In a place that's not
so infested with dark spirits?

14:09.413 --> 14:12.286

this ghost world access on tap.

in contact?

14:22.470 --> 14:23.775
What'd she do now?

14:23.819 --> 14:25.647
We're gonna perform a ceremony

14:25.690 --> 14:27.692
that'll hopefully
save Ace's life.

14:27.736 --> 14:29.738
There's room for a fourth.
You want in?

14:41.489 --> 14:43.752

telling me I should have

14:43.795 --> 14:45.188
more friends over.

14:45.232 --> 14:46.711
What exactly are you doing?

14:46.755 --> 14:50.019
Every culture has its own
on-ramp to the spirit world.

We're gonna use McGinnis's.

and mountains are sacred.

15:06.688 --> 15:08.690

15:08.733 --> 15:10.866

to the outermost layer

25:38.188 --> 25:41.670
we just started dating.
I mean, are we even dating?

25:41.714 --> 25:45.195
I don't know what we are, but...

25:45.239 --> 25:46.806
Can I fall apart on you?

25:46.849 --> 25:50.592
Easy on the ham, Bess. We're
trying to get a confession here.

25:50.636 --> 25:52.638
Yeah, of course.

25:54.901 --> 25:58.557
I wish you came straight to see
me when you got back to town.

25:58.600 --> 26:01.342
I had some work to do.
I'm sorry.

26:01.385 --> 26:02.996
What kind of work?

26:03.039 --> 26:05.825
LISBETH: I was sent to pick up
some of Ryan Hudson's things,

26:05.868 --> 26:07.696
stuff he needs at his
wellness retreat.

26:07.740 --> 26:10.177
BESS: So you don't
just drive for them?

26:10.220 --> 26:12.571
No, I do odds and ends.

26:15.574 --> 26:19.621
Have they ever asked you
to hurt someone for them?

26:19.665 --> 26:23.712
No. I... no,
that's not who I am.

26:23.756 --> 26:25.845
Well, who are you exactly then?

26:25.888 --> 26:27.498
Because you're not
who you claim to be.

26:27.542 --> 26:28.717
LISBETH: What are you talking about?

26:28.761 --> 26:30.197
BESS: Well, you're hiding something.

26:30.240 --> 26:33.722
Your social media.
This post,

26:33.766 --> 26:36.203
"dated" December of 2016,

26:36.246 --> 26:39.685
features an Issey Miyake blouse
that wasn't available until

26:39.728 --> 26:42.426
fall 2017, and these shoes...

26:42.470 --> 26:44.341
Why-why are we talking
about my clothes?

26:44.385 --> 26:48.650
Because your online identity
is a, is a fabrication.

26:48.694 --> 26:52.262
Everyone's is. No! You didn't exist before,
like, five years ago.

26:52.306 --> 26:54.308
Hon, did you do
their dirty work?

26:54.351 --> 26:57.398
Do your bosses know?
Did you hurt my friend?!

26:57.441 --> 26:59.226
No, I didn't.
Well, we'll see.

26:59.269 --> 27:01.620
Because I'm gonna
ask the Hudsons. I...

27:01.663 --> 27:04.666
You know, I'm gonna
go straight to the cops.

27:04.710 --> 27:06.581
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.583
Bess, please.

27:08.627 --> 27:11.978
[sighs]
You can't. You can't.

27:12.021 --> 27:13.632
You cannot speak to the Hudsons.

27:13.675 --> 27:16.765
You cannot speak to the local
police because I am undercover.

27:22.641 --> 27:23.685
I'm sorry, you're what?

27:23.729 --> 27:26.253
[sighs]

27:26.296 --> 27:27.733
Bess, I'm state police.

27:27.776 --> 27:30.736
I've been tasked with
investigating the Hudsons.

27:30.779 --> 27:32.041
We think they have someone

27:32.085 --> 27:33.477
in the local police force
on their payroll.

27:35.958 --> 27:40.484
[gasping]
McGINNIS: Focus on Ace.

27:40.528 --> 27:42.661
Call in his spirit.

27:46.665 --> 27:48.667
[gasps]

28:03.943 --> 28:05.509
McGinnis?

28:05.553 --> 28:08.687
You mean there's no way
to stop the bleeding?

28:13.039 --> 28:15.476
You mean there's no way
to stop the bleeding?

28:15.519 --> 28:17.043
Is she talking about Ace?

28:19.001 --> 28:20.524
Tell Thom...

28:20.568 --> 28:22.701
...we're here for him.

28:26.879 --> 28:28.750
Who's Thom?

28:28.794 --> 28:30.970
It's Ace's father.
This is good.

28:31.013 --> 28:34.625
I think George is seeing
a reflection of Ace's past,

28:34.669 --> 28:37.759
a night in a hospital
waiting room. I was there.

28:37.803 --> 28:39.761
In the spirit world?

28:39.805 --> 28:41.937
No, in real life, 15 years ago.

28:41.981 --> 28:45.941
The night Ace's father
almost died in the line of duty.

28:45.985 --> 28:48.770
I was with Ace

28:48.814 --> 28:51.686
in that waiting room all night.

28:51.730 --> 28:54.602
You said Ace would be frozen in
the moment of his greatest fear,

28:54.645 --> 28:56.604
but what if that
wasn't his car crash?

28:56.647 --> 28:59.563
It was the moment he thought
his father was going to die.

29:01.130 --> 29:02.784
George.

29:02.828 --> 29:05.656
We need to look for
a different version of Ace.

29:05.700 --> 29:08.703
He was six years old that night
in the wintertime.

29:08.747 --> 29:11.445
A high-speed chase
that nearly killed his father.

29:11.488 --> 29:13.490
[shuddering breaths]

29:16.145 --> 29:18.974
Happened on the ice
in a snowstorm.

29:40.866 --> 29:42.824
[eerie breathing echoes]

29:56.795 --> 29:58.709
Ace?

30:06.892 --> 30:08.937
[footsteps crunching in snow]

30:15.901 --> 30:17.859
[wind whistling]

30:20.166 --> 30:22.168
Ace?

30:35.790 --> 30:37.705
Ace?

30:37.748 --> 30:40.229
Are you lost?

30:40.273 --> 30:42.710
I can take you home.

30:42.753 --> 30:46.279
These boots don't belong.

30:55.941 --> 30:58.987
I have bare feet.

30:59.031 --> 31:02.251
Yeah. You do.

31:02.295 --> 31:04.645
[chuckles]

31:04.688 --> 31:06.125
Don't forget the boots.

31:16.309 --> 31:18.833
[gasps]

31:18.877 --> 31:20.791
[breathing heavily]

31:21.923 --> 31:24.056
Hey, hey, hey.

31:24.099 --> 31:27.146
Did it work?
Did you find Ace?

31:31.237 --> 31:32.934
That's his bear.

31:32.978 --> 31:34.109
He's with me.

31:45.686 --> 31:50.647
[woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.]

31:50.691 --> 31:53.912
He didn't wake up.

31:53.955 --> 31:56.653
The doctor noticed a change
in his brain waves.

31:56.697 --> 31:58.917
It was significant.

31:58.960 --> 32:00.396
Just not quite a miracle.

32:00.440 --> 32:02.398
But you made a
difference, right?

32:02.442 --> 32:05.358
Ace's spirit is back
in his body.

32:05.401 --> 32:07.447
But he has work to do
on his own now.

32:15.324 --> 32:18.240
There was something else
I saw on that spirit walk.

32:18.284 --> 32:20.329
I think Ace was trying
to give me a clue.

32:20.373 --> 32:23.942
Nick and Bess have been texting.

32:23.985 --> 32:26.074
A lot of red siren emojis.

32:26.118 --> 32:28.076
[exhales]

32:29.469 --> 32:31.036
GEORGE:
What's with the 911 texts?

32:31.079 --> 32:33.516
"Don't trust the cops"?

32:33.560 --> 32:35.127
Um...
[clears throat]

32:35.170 --> 32:39.479
we... have a source
that says

32:39.522 --> 32:41.437
there's a dirty cop
in Horseshoe Bay.

32:41.481 --> 32:43.222
You have a "source"?

32:43.265 --> 32:44.571
BESS:
There are reasons

32:44.614 --> 32:47.095
we cannot reveal
the identity of...

32:47.139 --> 32:50.272
You know her town car
is parked outside.

32:50.316 --> 32:53.449
Oof, I do not know whom
you are referring to.

32:53.493 --> 32:56.322
LISBETH:
I don't expect you to keep my cover.

32:56.365 --> 32:57.976
Although I should have
gotten you to build my legend.

32:58.019 --> 33:00.326
NANCY:
You're a cop.

33:00.369 --> 33:02.458
Whoa.

33:02.502 --> 33:04.634
Okay.

33:04.678 --> 33:07.463
Well, you were right
to suspect her.

33:07.507 --> 33:09.988
[sighs] No one could
like Bess that much.

33:10.031 --> 33:12.512
[scoffs]
Well, that part is real.

33:12.555 --> 33:14.035
Right? Yeah. Yes.

33:14.079 --> 33:15.080
Yeah.
It was.

33:15.123 --> 33:17.647
Past tense?

33:17.691 --> 33:20.085
Well, there's no way
I can stay under now.

33:20.128 --> 33:22.261
The Hudsons are already asking
questions about me seeing you.

33:22.304 --> 33:25.090
And now that you all know...

33:25.133 --> 33:26.700
NICK:
We'll...

33:26.743 --> 33:28.528
keep your secret.

33:28.571 --> 33:30.530
You have a criminal record,
and she's got

33:30.573 --> 33:31.748
an arraignment pending.
I'm not sure

33:31.792 --> 33:33.707
I'd trust you guys
with a surprise party.

33:33.750 --> 33:38.103
Oh, well, we also have the
Hudsons' secret books on a USB.

33:38.146 --> 33:41.367
Does that sweeten the deal?

33:41.410 --> 33:45.501
I have access to HBPD
financial records.

33:45.545 --> 33:48.026
We could always cross-reference
outgoing transfers

33:48.069 --> 33:50.680
from Hudson family accounts with
deposits made by local police.

33:50.724 --> 33:53.161
If there is a dirty cop
working for the Hudsons,

33:53.205 --> 33:54.249
couldn't they have been the one

33:54.293 --> 33:55.685
who put the receiver
on Laura's car?

33:55.729 --> 33:58.775
The could have cleaned it up
at the scene.

33:58.819 --> 34:01.474
Okay, um...

34:01.517 --> 34:04.259
I think I know what boots
they were wearing.

34:04.303 --> 34:07.088
I don't exactly know
how to explain it,

34:07.132 --> 34:09.786
but I think it was
the last thing Ace saw.

34:09.830 --> 34:12.528
Leather boots
with brass eyelets.

34:12.572 --> 34:15.357
Worn by the person
that caused the accident.

34:15.401 --> 34:19.057
Your shoe leather is
actual shoe leather?

34:19.100 --> 34:22.060
Bess, if I come forward,
there's a chance

34:22.103 --> 34:24.366
I could get pulled
from the field.

34:24.410 --> 34:25.454
Let me do it.

34:31.808 --> 34:33.767
I'm apprehensive.

34:33.810 --> 34:36.726
NANCY:
Chief, look at those numbers.
There's clearly a long pattern

34:36.770 --> 34:38.206
of payments between
the Hudson family

34:38.250 --> 34:40.121
and the private accounts of...

34:40.165 --> 34:41.209
What's your source?

34:41.253 --> 34:43.342
It's confidential.
[knock on door]

34:46.736 --> 34:48.260

34:48.303 --> 34:49.783
Final report on the
Laura Tandy incident.

34:49.826 --> 34:51.263
You found no foul play?

34:51.306 --> 34:53.091
No, sir.

34:53.134 --> 34:54.614
Huh.

34:54.657 --> 34:57.356
The car's CPU was wiped.
You didn't find that suspicious?

34:57.399 --> 34:58.835
I beg your pardon, that's...

34:58.879 --> 35:01.273
You know, for a dirty cop,
you clean up too thoroughly.

35:01.316 --> 35:03.101
You should have at least
made up some sort of mess

35:03.144 --> 35:04.580
about the CPU being wiped.

35:04.624 --> 35:07.148
Here, Chief, look at
the other printout.

35:07.192 --> 35:09.411
The car's actual
maintenance records.

35:09.455 --> 35:10.499
And then compare that

35:10.543 --> 35:12.501
to the doctored version

35:12.545 --> 35:14.155
that Officer Rawley
just handed you.

35:18.420 --> 35:20.118
How do you explain this?

35:20.161 --> 35:21.510
You can check his
personal accounts,

35:21.554 --> 35:24.339
and that'll link him
right to the Hudsons.

35:24.383 --> 35:26.211
What exactly are you
accusing me of?

35:29.562 --> 35:31.520
Killer boots, by the way.

35:37.222 --> 35:39.224
♪ ♪

35:49.886 --> 35:53.020
The Hudsons won't ask me
to defend a dirty cop.

35:53.063 --> 35:56.502
It would confirm
Rawley worked for them.

35:56.545 --> 35:59.026
They'll just claim the money
was a friendly loan,

35:59.069 --> 36:00.636
and pay him for his silence.

36:00.680 --> 36:03.248
So what do we do about them?

36:03.291 --> 36:05.641
We do nothing.

36:05.685 --> 36:07.252
Nothing?

36:07.295 --> 36:09.732
So, what, we just hope that
Laura Tandy lives long enough

36:09.776 --> 36:11.169
for them to take
another shot at her?

36:11.212 --> 36:14.215
What if they find out
how we caught Rawley?

36:14.259 --> 36:16.043
How did you catch him?

36:16.086 --> 36:20.787
George...
brought something back.

36:23.268 --> 36:26.532
I just don't want
any more people I care about

36:26.575 --> 36:28.142
getting hurt.

36:30.188 --> 36:31.928
Neither do I.

36:35.280 --> 36:38.587
Okay... that night
on the bluffs.

36:42.330 --> 36:45.899
I saw...

36:45.942 --> 36:48.902
tire tracks in the dirt,

36:48.945 --> 36:52.558
a piece of broken crown
on the rocks,

36:52.601 --> 36:57.737
and Lucy's dress dangling
off that cliff face.

36:57.780 --> 37:00.218
And you just took it.

37:02.132 --> 37:04.134
Why? Why didn't you
turn it over to the cops?

37:04.178 --> 37:05.310
I wanted to.

37:05.353 --> 37:09.749
But if it was a Hudson...

37:09.792 --> 37:12.230
I was scared of what
they'd do to us.

37:12.273 --> 37:15.145
So Laura Tandy was not
the first person

37:15.189 --> 37:16.930
the Hudsons drove into a ditch.

37:16.973 --> 37:19.933
No.

37:19.976 --> 37:24.111
And if they can do that
to a billionaire heiress,

37:24.154 --> 37:27.288
imagine what they could have
done to your mom and me.

37:27.332 --> 37:30.291
And you.

37:30.335 --> 37:31.945
I had to protect us.

37:31.988 --> 37:34.295
So you left town

37:34.339 --> 37:37.342
and took a check
the Hudsons wrote you

37:37.385 --> 37:39.996
for $50,000?

37:40.040 --> 37:42.912
That money was for
services rendered

37:42.956 --> 37:46.133
long before that night
on the cliff, and yes,

37:46.176 --> 37:47.787
it helped us get away from them.

37:47.830 --> 37:50.311
It's why we stayed in Europe
for the first year of your life.

37:54.315 --> 37:57.318

I would handle things.

I do not cover up for murderers.

38:11.158 --> 38:13.160
But you do break the law.

You stole evidence
from the morgue,

38:14.770 --> 38:17.643
and you sent it out of state
because you believed

38:17.686 --> 38:19.688
that it was
the right thing to do.

38:19.732 --> 38:23.997
I understand that... impulse.

38:24.040 --> 38:26.304
It runs in the family, I guess.

38:30.264 --> 38:32.310
from John Sander's lab.

38:32.353 --> 38:35.182
You were right about that.
