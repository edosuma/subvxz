00:00.900 --> 00:02.370
So here's what you missed on Glee:

00:02.420 --> 00:04.400
<i>Prom's coming up and Quinn's</i>
<i>desperate to win queen</i>

00:04.480 --> 00:05.100
<i>so she can hold on to Finn</i>

00:05.190 --> 00:06.710
<i>who still sort of</i>
<i>has eyes for Rachel.</i>

00:06.710 --> 00:09.050
<i>But Zizes also wants to be</i>
<i>queen and Puck's up for king</i>

00:09.070 --> 00:10.910
<i>and Karofsky and Santana</i>
<i>want to win too</i>

00:10.930 --> 00:12.400
<i>'cause they both got</i>
<i>a secret they'd like to keep.</i>

00:12.460 --> 00:13.730
Have you ever heard of the term "beards"?

00:13.770 --> 00:15.210
<i>Artie and Brittany</i>
<i>were BF and GF</i>

00:15.220 --> 00:16.570
<i>but he got mad</i>
<i>and said she was stupid</i>

00:16.680 --> 00:18.140
<i>and now they're not</i>
<i>BF and GF.</i>

00:18.210 --> 00:19.500
You were the only person at this school

00:19.540 --> 00:20.460
that never called me that.

00:20.480 --> 00:21.590
<i>Can you believe that?</i>

00:21.600 --> 00:23.580
<i>And that's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> Glee.

00:26.030 --> 00:28.180
Hi everyone.
It's junior prom minus six days

00:28.230 --> 00:30.200
here at McKinley and today I'm joined

00:30.290 --> 00:33.120
by Junior Prom King candidate
Noah Puckerman.

00:33.190 --> 00:35.860
I prefer Puck.
So Noah can I get a comment

00:35.910 --> 00:38.860
on the recent poll number that
put the Fabray/Hudson ticket

00:38.910 --> 00:41.030
ten points above you and Zizes...

00:41.080 --> 00:44.000
AKA the "Road Warriors.
" We're still ahead of Santana and Karofsky

00:44.050 --> 00:46.080
by half a point so our campaign strategy

00:46.170 --> 00:48.250
is to close the gap using a combination

00:48.340 --> 00:49.840
of intimidation and fear.

00:49.890 --> 00:51.420
Awesome and classy.

00:51.510 --> 00:54.090
One more question... this one
was e-mailed in by a fan.

00:54.180 --> 00:56.380
"Where does Lauren
keep your balls?"

00:57.510 --> 00:58.880
What?

00:58.930 --> 01:00.720
I'm sure you've heard
the word on the street

01:00.770 --> 01:02.820
that you've been
neutered by Ms. Zizes.

01:02.880 --> 01:05.050
That she's the one who wears
the pants in the relationship.

01:05.099 --> 01:06.720
Shut up or I'll beat your ass.

01:06.770 --> 01:09.190
I'm not scared...
I've been hit by a girl before.

01:09.240 --> 01:11.410
This is JBI signing off.

01:11.490 --> 01:13.280
Tune in tomorrow when we'll be interviewing

01:13.360 --> 01:15.110
frontrunner Quinn Fabray.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.450
Hubba hubba.

01:21.120 --> 01:23.500
I have some bad news.

01:23.570 --> 01:24.790
Will Schuester is leaving McKinley

01:24.870 --> 01:26.090
to go to Broadway.

01:26.180 --> 01:27.740
Oh William I'm devasted...

01:27.790 --> 01:29.460
Positively horny with grief.

01:29.550 --> 01:31.600
As a going-away present
here's a spray bottle

01:31.680 --> 01:33.580
of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter

01:33.630 --> 01:35.850
to keep that head-merken
looking buttery fresh.

01:35.920 --> 01:38.350
No no. Junior prom
is in one week

01:38.420 --> 01:40.020
and my favorite band cancelled.

01:40.090 --> 01:41.860
What band?
Air Supply William.

01:41.920 --> 01:44.430
So I'm inviting my next favorite group:

01:44.480 --> 01:45.560
The New Directions.

01:45.610 --> 01:47.650
Nope. No way.
Um...

01:47.730 --> 01:49.760
I agree. I mean
normally we would jump

01:49.820 --> 01:51.030
at the chance to perform but...

01:51.100 --> 01:52.550
I mean we've got Nationals in three weeks

01:52.620 --> 01:54.320
which means that we have
a lot of rehearsals

01:54.400 --> 01:56.990
and a lot of taffy to sell
just so we can afford the trip.

01:57.070 --> 01:59.990
William this glass is half-full
of dreams for all of us.

02:00.080 --> 02:02.040
I have decided to give all the money

02:02.110 --> 02:04.660
to the Glee Club that I was
going to pay Air Supply!

02:04.750 --> 02:06.910
So that's $400 right there for you.

02:06.970 --> 02:10.470
I won't allow it... I'm prom
coordinator and I was not consulted.

02:10.550 --> 02:14.720
Each year I honor the prom with a bowl
of my family's secret punch recipe

02:14.790 --> 02:17.230
made all the more meaningful
to me because it's

02:17.290 --> 02:18.960
the punch bowl my grandmother drowned in.

02:19.010 --> 02:22.310
And each year that punch bowl is spiked.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.030
Such lawlessness will only be encouraged

02:24.100 --> 02:26.900
when being screeched at by that Glee Club!

02:26.970 --> 02:28.440
Sue it is not a discussion!

02:28.490 --> 02:29.850
We are in the lurch!

02:29.940 --> 02:33.160
Fine. Well then let me
take this opportunity

02:33.240 --> 02:34.490
to make a request.

02:34.580 --> 02:37.650
William I have in my Spanks at all times

02:37.700 --> 02:39.250
a list of <i>the</i> worst songs

02:39.310 --> 02:40.920
ever performed by the Glee Club.

02:40.980 --> 02:43.120
And I would appreciate it
if you would not reprise

02:43.170 --> 02:44.540
any of the following numbers.

02:44.620 --> 02:45.540
Number one.

02:45.620 --> 02:46.950
"Run Joey Run."

02:47.010 --> 02:48.820
You should literally apologize to America

02:48.870 --> 02:50.430
for that one.
Number two.

02:50.490 --> 02:51.660
The ingenius mash-up

02:51.710 --> 02:53.800
of "Crazy in Love"
and "Hair."

02:53.850 --> 02:55.100
Now I know you must have been

02:55.160 --> 02:57.100
pretty tired when you
put that baby together.

02:57.170 --> 02:59.470
If you'll excuse me.

02:59.520 --> 03:01.390
We'll see you at the prom butt chin.

03:03.940 --> 03:05.360
I've been to Ann Taylor Loft.

03:05.440 --> 03:06.890
Filene's Basement and like six Forever 21s

03:06.980 --> 03:08.680
and I cannot find a dress that fits.

03:08.730 --> 03:11.350
I'm gonna be forced
to make my own dress for prom.

03:11.400 --> 03:12.510
Don't. You'll seem poor.
You're up for queen.

03:12.560 --> 03:13.950
You can't make your own prom dress.

03:14.020 --> 03:15.180
Prom is like our Oscars.

03:15.230 --> 03:16.400
It's seriously like

03:16.490 --> 03:17.950
the most important night of our lives.

03:18.020 --> 03:19.320
What about getting married?

03:19.370 --> 03:21.240
Oh you can get married
as many times as you want.

03:21.320 --> 03:23.070
You only have one shot at your junior prom.

03:23.160 --> 03:25.830
What are you guys talking about?
Prom dresses.

03:25.880 --> 03:28.130
Thank God I don't have to worry about that.
I'm not going.

03:28.200 --> 03:31.030
Why not?
'Cause nobody's asked me.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.130
All right guys... prom.

03:32.200 --> 03:33.220
Please tell me we're not

03:33.300 --> 03:34.470
doing songs about prom.

03:34.540 --> 03:36.170
Nope. We <i>are</i> the prom.

03:36.220 --> 03:37.760
Figgins has asked us to perform.

03:37.840 --> 03:38.970
Let's do
"Run Joey Run."

03:39.040 --> 03:41.290
Now I know this isn't ideal with.

03:41.360 --> 03:42.390
Nationals coming up but we really don't

03:42.480 --> 03:43.590
have a choice.

03:43.680 --> 03:45.410
And we could really use the money.

03:45.480 --> 03:47.880
But I know that prom is a
special rite of passage.

03:47.930 --> 03:49.270
I'm gonna make sure that all of you guys

03:49.350 --> 03:50.700
get a chance to enjoy the dance too.

03:50.770 --> 03:51.900
So we're gonna stagger

03:51.990 --> 03:53.050
the performances

03:53.110 --> 03:54.860
so that each and every one of you

03:54.910 --> 03:57.560
has a lot of time to dance with your dates.

03:57.610 --> 03:59.280
Excuse me.

04:02.900 --> 04:05.050
Is she okay?
Mercedes doesn't have a date for prom.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.900
So? I don't have a date.

04:06.950 --> 04:09.000
I'm just going to dance and
then all your dates are

04:09.070 --> 04:10.760
gonna ignore you and come
dance with me so...

04:10.840 --> 04:12.290
Your dates are really my dates.

04:12.370 --> 04:13.540
I'm gonna go talk

04:13.590 --> 04:15.290
to Mercedes.
No. Let me.

04:17.750 --> 04:19.260
Hey.

04:21.220 --> 04:23.430
You know I don't have
a date to prom either.

04:23.520 --> 04:25.470
You know I know that I talk a good game

04:25.550 --> 04:27.220
about not needing a man and I don't.

04:27.270 --> 04:29.890
I just really wanted to
take a date to the prom.

04:29.940 --> 04:32.810
I want the dress...

04:32.880 --> 04:35.260
And the guy...

04:35.310 --> 04:37.370
And the damn corsage.

04:37.430 --> 04:40.540
Somebody... somebody
still may ask you.

04:40.600 --> 04:43.200
It's this Saturday.
You know...

04:43.270 --> 04:46.460
I just wanted to be Cinderella...

04:46.530 --> 04:49.210
Just for one night.

04:49.280 --> 04:51.380
One night where a guy would...

04:51.450 --> 04:54.750
Would look at me under those
corny crepe paper streamers

04:54.800 --> 04:57.770
and say... "You
look so beautiful."

04:57.840 --> 05:00.220
And then he'd...

05:00.290 --> 05:02.470
Grab my hand and ask me to dance.

05:02.540 --> 05:06.540
Isn't that what prom
is supposed to be about?

05:06.610 --> 05:09.280
You're not gonna go to prom alone.

05:09.350 --> 05:11.680
You'll go with me.
That's even more depressing.

05:11.770 --> 05:14.270
I have a plan.

05:15.850 --> 05:17.420
Give me your hand.

05:18.970 --> 05:20.320
Blaine Warbler...

05:20.410 --> 05:23.010
Will you go to junior prom with me?

05:23.080 --> 05:24.830
Prom?

05:24.900 --> 05:27.050
It'll be the social event of the season.

05:27.120 --> 05:29.250
You don't want to go
to prom with me? No no

05:29.320 --> 05:31.150
of course of course I want to go with you.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.420
It's just...

05:33.490 --> 05:34.840
Prom.

05:34.920 --> 05:36.920
What about prom Blaine?

05:36.990 --> 05:40.360
At my old school
there was a Sadie Hawkins Dance

05:40.430 --> 05:43.750
and... I had <i>just</i> come out

05:43.820 --> 05:46.180
so I asked a friend of mine

05:46.270 --> 05:49.000
the only other gay guy in the school

05:49.050 --> 05:53.640
and while we were waiting
for his dad to pick us up...

05:53.710 --> 05:55.930
These three guys...

05:55.990 --> 05:57.850
Um...

05:59.310 --> 06:01.850
...beat the living crap
out of us.

06:01.920 --> 06:03.620
I...

06:03.690 --> 06:05.450
I'm so sorry.

06:05.520 --> 06:06.950
I'm-I'm out and I'm proud

06:07.020 --> 06:08.620
and all that...
this is just

06:08.690 --> 06:10.090
a little bit of a sore spot.

06:10.160 --> 06:11.530
This is perfect.

06:11.580 --> 06:14.050
You couldn't face up
to the bullies at your school

06:14.130 --> 06:15.910
so you can do it at mine.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.730
We could do it together.

06:19.300 --> 06:21.170
But I have to say Blaine

06:21.220 --> 06:23.890
that if it makes you feel
uncomfortable at all

06:23.970 --> 06:26.710
then we'll just forget about prom.

06:26.760 --> 06:28.760
We'll go to a movie instead.

06:30.300 --> 06:32.060
I am crazy about you.

06:32.150 --> 06:35.300
So I'll take that as a yes?

06:36.820 --> 06:38.190
Yes.

06:38.240 --> 06:40.240
Yes you and I are going to the prom.

06:40.320 --> 06:41.560
Mm mm!

06:41.610 --> 06:43.570
Is this a surprise party or something?

06:43.660 --> 06:45.390
Because my birthday was last week.

06:45.440 --> 06:46.730
It-it was?

06:46.780 --> 06:48.560
Um no.

06:48.610 --> 06:50.410
Mercedes and I we have
a proposition for you.

06:50.500 --> 06:53.020
We were wondering if you'd like to go

06:53.090 --> 06:54.900
to prom with us.
Kind of like a...

06:54.950 --> 06:57.310
A three-way date but
not the dirty kind.

06:57.370 --> 06:59.370
That sounds great
but I can't afford to take

06:59.420 --> 07:01.510
one girl to the prom; I don't
know how I'm gonna take two.

07:02.930 --> 07:04.300
What's this?
Our prom budget.

07:04.380 --> 07:05.880
You're gonna have to borrow
a suit from your dad

07:05.930 --> 07:07.270
and we're gonna buy
five-dollar dresses

07:07.350 --> 07:09.100
down at the Goodwill
and make our own corsages

07:09.180 --> 07:10.640
out of flowers from my mom's garden.

07:10.720 --> 07:12.750
And we can walk to prom
and then use what's left

07:12.800 --> 07:14.560
to get the $8.99
all-you-can-eat

07:14.610 --> 07:16.590
pasta special at Breadstix.

07:16.640 --> 07:19.860
But you know the $20 it's
not charity it's a loan.

07:21.150 --> 07:23.510
So... you'll go with us?

07:26.030 --> 07:27.940
It would be an honor.

07:27.990 --> 07:29.150
Yes!

07:34.810 --> 07:37.810
Ladies I appreciate you welcoming me

07:37.890 --> 07:41.020
into the sacred inner sanctum
that is the prom gown dry run.

07:41.100 --> 07:42.350
Why did we decide to include Kurt?

07:42.440 --> 07:44.010
Because getting a look past him is like

07:44.060 --> 07:45.720
getting a thumbs up
from Joan and Melissa Rivers.

07:45.810 --> 07:48.230
It just might goose
our pre-prom buzz factor.

07:53.820 --> 07:54.580
I look like

07:54.630 --> 07:55.870
a lemon meringue pie.

07:56.770 --> 07:58.100
I think you look delicious.

07:58.470 --> 07:59.700
Don't despair.

07:59.870 --> 08:01.510
Nobody bigger than a size two

08:01.750 --> 08:03.330
looks good in a prom dress.
I mean they're practically

08:03.370 --> 08:05.100
designed to make us look awkward.

08:05.180 --> 08:06.390
I think

08:06.430 --> 08:08.070
the color is wrong.

08:08.130 --> 08:09.580
Let's go navy hm?

08:10.290 --> 08:11.670
It's chic <i>and</i> slimming.

08:11.750 --> 08:13.370
Duly noted.

08:13.460 --> 08:14.540
Agree? Agree?
Oh my God.

08:14.620 --> 08:15.760
It's brilliant.

08:15.820 --> 08:16.820
Absolutely.
Next.

08:18.490 --> 08:20.510
I knew it. Fashion.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.130
Devil in a red dress.

08:22.180 --> 08:24.600
Perfect and it's totally
appropriate for your personality.

08:24.670 --> 08:25.830
I have no criticisms.

08:25.890 --> 08:27.220
Go with God Satan. Santana.

08:28.770 --> 08:29.940
Now if you ladies'll excuse me

08:30.010 --> 08:32.140
I have to pull options
for my own prom outfit.

08:32.190 --> 08:34.280
Wait so you're
going? Stag?

08:34.340 --> 08:35.730
That's just tragic.

08:35.809 --> 08:38.610
Yes I'm going and not alone.

08:38.679 --> 08:40.120
With Blaine.

08:41.400 --> 08:42.780
Congratulations!
That's amazing!

08:42.850 --> 08:44.240
Ladies if you'll excuse me

08:44.320 --> 08:46.400
I have a private fashion
question for Kurt. Okay.

08:46.490 --> 08:48.540
So Kurt

08:48.620 --> 08:51.360
I think that you need a full security
detail which the Bully Whips

08:51.410 --> 08:54.000
and I would be more than
happy to provide you with.

08:54.050 --> 08:55.880
You know like the Hell's
Angels when the Rolling Stones

08:55.950 --> 08:58.170
the Rolling Stones performed
at Altamont Speedway.

08:58.390 --> 08:59.940
I think that went off without a hitch.

09:00.030 --> 09:01.540
And why would you do that?

09:01.590 --> 09:03.340
Because I'll get sympathy
votes for prom queen.

09:03.390 --> 09:05.970
I'll be like the law-and-order
Eva Peron candidate.

09:06.040 --> 09:07.260
Grimace and Stretch Marks

09:07.330 --> 09:08.580
won't stand a chance.

09:13.100 --> 09:15.400
So since you don't have a date

09:15.480 --> 09:17.220
to the prom now I was hoping you could

09:17.270 --> 09:18.820
help me out with Operation Punch and Judy.

09:18.890 --> 09:20.070
Every year at McKinley

09:20.160 --> 09:22.140
they crown a king and queen at the prom

09:22.210 --> 09:23.980
but there's a shadow
world... a dark community

09:24.040 --> 09:26.360
of trouble makers that
crown the prom anti-king.

09:26.410 --> 09:29.200
And you're planning on that being you?

09:29.250 --> 09:30.750
My street cred's in the gutter.

09:30.830 --> 09:32.900
If I actually win Prom King
with Lauren I'll never be able

09:32.950 --> 09:34.250
to rebuild my reputation

09:34.340 --> 09:36.070
as a lovable but dangerous miscreant.

09:36.120 --> 09:37.840
I have to spike Coach Sylvester's punch.

09:37.910 --> 09:39.870
What does this have to do with me?

09:39.930 --> 09:41.880
I'm prime suspect number one.

09:41.930 --> 09:44.630
Coach Sylvester won't let me
within ten feet of that bowl.

09:44.710 --> 09:46.210
<i>When she grabs me</i>

09:46.270 --> 09:48.770
<i>I'll create a diversion</i>
<i>with my sweet dance moves.</i>

09:48.850 --> 09:51.140
<i>She'll be mesmerized</i>
<i>hypnotized by my love dance.</i>

09:51.220 --> 09:53.220
<i>That's when you'll</i>
<i>sneak in behind us</i>

09:53.270 --> 09:55.140
<i>and pour a bottle of gin</i>
<i>in the bowl.</i>

09:55.220 --> 09:56.470
Awesome right?

09:56.560 --> 09:57.940
So are you in?

09:58.030 --> 10:00.480
As my ass-istant bad-ass?
Look

10:00.560 --> 10:01.980
I'm... I'm sorry.

10:02.060 --> 10:03.450
While I admire

10:03.530 --> 10:06.120
your bad-boy villainy
and yes long for the day

10:06.200 --> 10:07.870
when I am similarly cool

10:07.940 --> 10:10.070
I just I don't think spiking the prom hooch

10:10.120 --> 10:12.120
will impress Brittany enough.

10:12.210 --> 10:14.290
There's got to be a surefire way

10:14.380 --> 10:17.280
for her to both forgive me
and accept my prom proposal.

10:17.330 --> 10:20.280
There's got to be.

10:20.330 --> 10:23.250
Oh members of the Audio-Visual
Club I may possibly

10:23.300 --> 10:24.720
sing this song at prom

10:24.790 --> 10:27.260
and when I'm done rehearsing
I'd like your feedback.

10:27.310 --> 10:30.090
Tell me if I was brilliant
or simply outstanding.

It's good to see you again Rachel.

12:49.770 --> 12:53.920
Jessie... what are
you doing here?

12:53.990 --> 12:55.150
I mean how was I supposed to know

12:55.220 --> 12:56.390
that I was actually supposed to show up

12:56.460 --> 12:57.760
to those other classes at school?

12:57.820 --> 12:59.890
I was majoring in show choir.

12:59.960 --> 13:01.780
I just assumed it would be like at Carmel

13:01.840 --> 13:03.410
and the school would get some Asian kid

13:03.480 --> 13:05.660
to take math and English
and scientific for me.

13:05.750 --> 13:07.720
That's awful.

13:07.780 --> 13:09.670
I came back to see you Rachel.

13:13.010 --> 13:17.730
What I did to you...
that's my one great regret.

13:17.790 --> 13:21.600
Yeah it was kind of weird.

13:21.660 --> 13:23.650
One day you were telling
me that you loved me

13:23.730 --> 13:25.150
and then you were
inexplicably throwing eggs

13:25.230 --> 13:26.270
at my head the next.

13:26.340 --> 13:29.400
I know I know.

13:29.470 --> 13:30.640
I traded love

13:30.690 --> 13:34.390
for a fourth consecutive
national championship.

13:34.460 --> 13:36.530
It was a bum deal.

13:36.610 --> 13:38.750
For a first maybe but for a fourth no way.

13:38.810 --> 13:41.750
I've come to make amends.

13:45.870 --> 13:47.670
So what are you doing for prom?

13:52.230 --> 13:55.670
So I heard a nasty rumor that Jessie St.
James is back in town

13:55.720 --> 13:58.830
and I also heard that he
is going to be your date.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.030
No he's joining

14:00.060 --> 14:01.980
Mercedes and Sam and I
on our prom on a budget.

14:02.040 --> 14:04.050
He's going to be in town for a while though

14:04.100 --> 14:05.510
so I'm not sure what's going to come of it.

14:05.570 --> 14:06.900
I just...
I don't trust him.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.680
Don't you remember what he did
to you how awful he was?

14:08.740 --> 14:10.900
You can't tell me what to do anymore okay?

14:10.990 --> 14:12.940
If I want to date Jessie
or anyone for that matter

14:13.020 --> 14:15.360
it stopped being your business
when you broke up with me.

14:15.410 --> 14:16.610
I-I still care about you.

14:19.500 --> 14:22.230
Look all I ask is that whoever I choose

14:22.280 --> 14:23.730
that you be as supportive of me

14:23.780 --> 14:25.530
as I have been of you and Quinn even though

14:25.590 --> 14:27.590
I'm dying every day inside about it.

14:30.670 --> 14:33.290
You know I don't even want to
go to the stupid prom anymore.

14:33.380 --> 14:34.760
Quinn has got me handing out

14:34.840 --> 14:36.080
pens with our names on them.

14:36.130 --> 14:37.460
Where's the dignity?

14:37.550 --> 14:40.430
And I hate renting those
tuxes and the corsage...

14:40.520 --> 14:41.800
I know I'm going to pick the wrong one

14:41.890 --> 14:43.440
and then Quinn's going to be all pissed off

14:43.520 --> 14:46.940
and her mom's going to look at me like...
Hey just...

14:47.020 --> 14:48.390
Just get her something simple...

14:48.440 --> 14:50.480
A wrist corsage.

14:50.560 --> 14:51.890
Girls like Quinn...
you don't want to do anything

14:51.950 --> 14:53.260
that's going to distract from their face

14:53.310 --> 14:55.110
so ask for a gardenia

14:55.200 --> 14:57.370
with a with a light green ribbon

14:57.430 --> 14:58.500
wrapped around it to match her eyes.

15:00.190 --> 15:02.070
Okay?

15:10.910 --> 15:12.380
Everything looks good.

15:12.450 --> 15:17.000
No gay protests or rainbow flags
being lit on fire down this way.

15:17.090 --> 15:18.640
Are you finished talking?

15:18.720 --> 15:20.120
Yeah.

15:20.170 --> 15:21.340
When you're finished talking
you should say "over."

15:21.420 --> 15:22.340
Sorry.

15:22.430 --> 15:24.090
No burning Liberace mannequins.

15:24.140 --> 15:25.140
Over.

15:25.230 --> 15:27.960
All right lady lips all clear.

15:28.010 --> 15:31.070
Teen gay you may now proceed
to the next checkpoint

15:31.130 --> 15:33.520
without fear of violence.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.650
Why are you speaking so loud?

15:35.740 --> 15:37.690
I'm the law-and-order
prom queen candidate

15:37.770 --> 15:39.810
here to protect
every student at this school

15:39.860 --> 15:40.980
from harassment.

15:41.030 --> 15:42.160
Did she...?

15:42.250 --> 15:43.810
I'm I'm walking away from you now.

15:46.250 --> 15:49.250
Just crack the egg.

15:49.320 --> 15:51.320
I just don't understand
the difference between an egg

15:51.370 --> 15:53.760
with a baby chicken inside of it
and an egg with an egg in it.

15:53.820 --> 15:54.960
They're the same thing.

15:55.020 --> 15:56.710
Okay that's really confusing

15:56.790 --> 15:58.710
because this is a baby chicken's house.

15:58.800 --> 16:00.010
Mrs. Hagberg
I understand that cupcakes

16:00.100 --> 16:01.460
are really trendy right now

16:01.510 --> 16:03.150
and I know the making of a foie gras

16:03.220 --> 16:04.520
might be a little morose

16:04.600 --> 16:06.690
but um I would like to
at least graduate high school

16:06.770 --> 16:08.270
knowing how to make some kind of pâté.

16:08.340 --> 16:10.720
Excuse me Mrs. Hagberg
I need to say something.

16:14.310 --> 16:15.360
Brittany I was a jerk

16:15.450 --> 16:16.810
to you.

16:16.860 --> 16:18.900
Mm-hmm. And I want to make
it up to you with a song

16:18.980 --> 16:21.180
so maybe you'll consider going
to prom with me.

Artie that was lovely

17:51.360 --> 17:53.560
but I'm not going to go to prom with you.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.510
You called me stupid and
I really didn't like that

17:55.560 --> 18:00.120
so I'm sorry but I'm
gonna go to prom by myself

18:00.180 --> 18:01.650
and really work on me

18:01.700 --> 18:03.040
and dance with other people's dates.

18:06.290 --> 18:08.290
I understand.

18:08.360 --> 18:11.540
I I hope you know how sorry I am.

18:12.760 --> 18:14.960
Yeah.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.750
Dude...

18:21.840 --> 18:24.370
Sorry for the timing
but I'd really like to revisit

18:24.420 --> 18:26.370
the possibility of you helping
me spike the punch bowl.

18:26.430 --> 18:29.210
I'm in.

18:29.260 --> 18:31.210
I have nothing to live for.

18:35.940 --> 18:38.820
So you think it's cool if
I jam with you guys at prom?

18:38.890 --> 18:40.660
Yeah totally.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.390
Good news boys.

18:42.440 --> 18:45.030
My buddy Enzo from the tux rental shop

18:45.080 --> 18:46.160
is giving you half off.

18:46.230 --> 18:47.500
Sweet.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.200
Yeah so what are you going to go with?

18:49.250 --> 18:50.170
I'm going simple...

18:50.230 --> 18:51.570
Black

18:51.620 --> 18:53.340
thin lapel collar...
very discreet.

18:53.400 --> 18:54.670
Know what I wore to my prom?

18:54.740 --> 18:56.570
I wore a powder blue tux
with a ruffled shirt

18:56.640 --> 18:58.910
and a big velour bowtie.

18:58.960 --> 19:00.340
Looked like Tony Orlando.

19:00.410 --> 19:02.380
Was that a designer?

19:02.430 --> 19:03.760
No.

19:03.850 --> 19:05.010
No need for half off my outfit.

19:05.080 --> 19:08.080
Because half of it is already off?

19:08.130 --> 19:10.270
My ensemble is an homage
to the recent royal wedding

19:10.350 --> 19:11.520
and the late Alexander McQueen.

19:11.590 --> 19:12.940
I had to make it myself.

19:13.020 --> 19:14.860
There's simply nothing
off the rack that is suitable

19:14.920 --> 19:16.440
for the young fashionable man in Ohio.

19:16.530 --> 19:20.150
Dude that rocks.
It's like gay Braveheart.

19:20.230 --> 19:22.060
I don't like it.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.030
Well of course you don't like it.

19:23.100 --> 19:24.450
It's not finished yet.

19:24.530 --> 19:26.600
I think it still needs like
a sash or maybe some beads.

19:26.650 --> 19:27.950
Look I'm not going to stop you

19:28.040 --> 19:30.870
from wearing it
but I got to be honest... I...

19:30.940 --> 19:32.320
I think you're just trying to stir

19:32.410 --> 19:33.660
the pot a little bit.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.040
I think you're trying
to get some attention.

19:35.110 --> 19:35.990
Exactly.

19:36.080 --> 19:37.300
What's the point of dressing up?

19:37.380 --> 19:38.380
I mean that's why some guys wear

19:38.450 --> 19:39.500
the tails with the top hat

19:39.580 --> 19:40.880
and and the girls wear the hoop skirts.

19:40.950 --> 19:42.050
I mean Blaine help me out here.

19:42.120 --> 19:43.450
I think your dad has a point.

19:44.950 --> 19:46.720
I-I think what
he's trying to say

19:46.790 --> 19:48.010
is that we just don't want

19:48.090 --> 19:50.730
to give anyone a reason
to cause any trouble.

19:50.790 --> 19:51.640
There's a lot of bad people out there Kurt

19:51.730 --> 19:52.640
and they're a lot worse

19:52.710 --> 19:54.100
than this Karofsky kid

19:54.150 --> 19:56.150
and all they're looking for is a match

19:56.230 --> 19:57.150
to light under the fire

19:57.230 --> 19:58.570
of their hate.

19:58.630 --> 20:00.470
Now of course I

20:00.520 --> 20:03.810
I want I want you to be yourself

20:03.860 --> 20:06.960
but I also... I want you
to be practical.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.800
I have done everything right.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.420
Now Blaine I understand

20:15.480 --> 20:18.500
that after what you've been
through you're worried

20:18.590 --> 20:21.570
but prom is about joy not about fear.

20:21.640 --> 20:23.680
So I am wearing this suit.

20:23.760 --> 20:25.210
I worked hard on it

20:25.290 --> 20:26.830
and I think it's fantastic

20:26.880 --> 20:30.020
and if you don't want to join
me I completely understand.

20:32.000 --> 20:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

20:39.340 --> 20:41.980
Here we are third period French class.

20:42.050 --> 20:43.880
I'm going to calculus
so wait inside the classroom

20:43.930 --> 20:45.100
after the bell rings

20:45.180 --> 20:46.880
until I get back to walk you to lunch.

20:48.440 --> 20:51.550
Have you noticed that no one
has said boo to me this week?

20:51.610 --> 20:52.610
That's 'cause the Bullywhips
are protecting you.

20:52.690 --> 20:53.890
Maybe.

20:53.940 --> 20:55.990
But maybe no one has been
harassing me this week

20:56.060 --> 20:57.280
because nobody cares.

20:57.360 --> 20:59.080
You're dreaming.
Okay look

20:59.160 --> 21:01.060
I'm not saying that everyone in this school

21:01.110 --> 21:02.700
is ready to embrace the gay

21:02.750 --> 21:04.350
but maybe at least

21:04.420 --> 21:05.540
they've evolved enough to be indifferent.

21:08.340 --> 21:10.270
I see how miserable you are Dave.

21:12.540 --> 21:14.030
I could just hate you
when you were bullying me

21:14.090 --> 21:17.650
but... now all I see
is your pain.

21:19.600 --> 21:21.380
And you don't have to torture
yourself over this.

21:21.440 --> 21:24.300
I'm not saying you should come out tomorrow

21:24.390 --> 21:28.390
but maybe soon the moment
will arise when you can.

21:32.200 --> 21:34.150
What's wrong?

21:38.990 --> 21:42.120
I'm so I'm so freaking sorry Kurt.

21:42.190 --> 21:43.570
I'm just...

21:44.830 --> 21:48.880
...so sorry for
what I did to you.

21:48.950 --> 21:50.330
I know.

21:50.410 --> 21:52.000
I know.

21:54.800 --> 21:56.920
Cool.

21:56.970 --> 21:58.050
Thanks.

22:00.620 --> 22:03.930
Remember you wait for me here right?

22:12.190 --> 22:14.990
Quinny! Your date's here!

22:24.360 --> 22:26.270
That's one of the good things
about being in Glee Club.

22:26.330 --> 22:28.280
You really get to know
your way around a cummerbund.

22:37.510 --> 22:39.100
Let me get my camera.

22:40.710 --> 22:42.050
You look great.

22:42.130 --> 22:43.550
You're the most beautiful girl

22:43.630 --> 22:46.270
I've ever seen in my life.

22:48.060 --> 22:51.970
I uh... I got you
a wrist corsage.

22:57.150 --> 22:59.820
The ribbon matches my eyes.
I know.

23:06.990 --> 23:10.040
Okay you two picture time.

23:10.130 --> 23:11.740
You look like Cinderella.

23:11.830 --> 23:14.130
Let's get together. Ah!

23:14.200 --> 23:15.920
Okay.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.470
Give me prom pose.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
Mercedes can I just say
that you look fierce

23:22.060 --> 23:23.710
in your dress?
Totally Mercedes.

23:23.760 --> 23:25.370
You both look smokin'.

23:25.430 --> 23:27.560
You're damn straight we do.

23:27.640 --> 23:29.480
Seriously though Jessie what
do you think of the bolo tie?

23:29.550 --> 23:30.400
Pretty cool right?

23:30.480 --> 23:31.900
Saw Springsteen

23:31.980 --> 23:34.770
in the cover of <i>Tunnel of Love</i>
album wearing it.

23:34.850 --> 23:37.750
Dude that was like 20 years ago.

23:39.110 --> 23:40.820
I'm really sorry to hear

23:40.890 --> 23:42.730
about what happened with your family Sam.

23:42.780 --> 23:44.230
Um I hope
it's okay; I sort of

23:44.280 --> 23:45.660
filled Jessie in on what was going on.

23:45.730 --> 23:46.910
Of course it's okay.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.110
Sam has nothing to be ashamed of.

23:48.200 --> 23:50.750
I know how tough it is out there.

23:50.820 --> 23:52.200
I couldn't even get a job

23:52.270 --> 23:54.500
as one of those singing waiters
at Johnny Rockets.

23:54.570 --> 23:56.570
But I've got an idea.

23:56.620 --> 23:57.920
They say that the best time

23:57.990 --> 23:59.630
to start any business
is during a recession.

23:59.710 --> 24:01.540
I don't know why
or even what a recession is

24:01.600 --> 24:03.750
but it's my understanding
that we're in one.

24:03.800 --> 24:06.050
He's so smart. I can't believe
he flunked out of college.

24:06.100 --> 24:07.420
So I was thinking.

24:07.470 --> 24:09.390
What are the two things that I'm great at?

24:09.440 --> 24:11.390
Show choir and destroying the competition.

24:11.440 --> 24:14.810
So what if I opened up a dance studio

24:14.880 --> 24:16.480
where I could act as a consultant

24:16.560 --> 24:18.440
for show choirs looking
to get that extra edge?

24:18.530 --> 24:20.010
Do you think there are enough show choirs

24:20.080 --> 24:21.450
to keep you in business?

24:21.530 --> 24:23.530
Of course there are.
That-That's a brilliant idea!

24:23.600 --> 24:25.950
You could... You could be like
The-The Show Choir Whisperer.

24:27.700 --> 24:30.210
I'm sure we could get Mr. Shue
to hire him in a second and

24:30.270 --> 24:31.620
that's how we can beat Vocal Adrenaline!

24:31.710 --> 24:32.960
Hey guys. You look amazing!

24:33.040 --> 24:35.660
And don't forget to vote
for Hudson-Fabray tonight.

24:35.750 --> 24:37.750
Hey Jessie. What'd you order
scrambled eggs?

24:37.800 --> 24:38.910
I mean I know you usually

24:38.970 --> 24:40.670
like them served on people's heads.

24:40.750 --> 24:41.780
Quinn you look stunning.

24:41.840 --> 24:43.340
The ghost of Grace Kelly.

24:43.420 --> 24:44.420
Let me know if you get tired

24:44.470 --> 24:46.060
of your boyfriend stomping on your

24:46.120 --> 24:47.090
pretty little feet all night.

24:47.140 --> 24:48.670
I'll be more than happy to cut in.

24:48.740 --> 24:49.810
Okay hush you guys.

24:49.890 --> 24:52.480
You're totally ruining the vibe.

24:52.560 --> 24:53.730
Quinn you look hot.

24:53.800 --> 24:55.460
Finn you look handsome.

24:55.520 --> 24:57.180
Love you guys but get lost.

24:57.270 --> 24:57.970
We'll see you there.

24:58.020 --> 24:59.300
All right.

24:59.350 --> 25:00.490
This is gonna be off the hook.

25:00.570 --> 25:01.340
Who's ready for some prom?

25:01.400 --> 25:02.520
I'm ready for prom.

25:02.610 --> 25:04.270
Go prom. I like prom.
Cheers guys.

to the dentist will tell you

is an excruciating affair

Roll the drum please.

And this year's Junior Prom King is...

33:55.120 --> 33:56.890
...David Karofsky!

34:01.960 --> 34:03.980
You suck so bad

Quinn Fabray.
I won.

Your 2011 McKinley High Prom Queen...

...with an overwhelming

number of write-in votes is...

34:29.510 --> 34:30.969
Kurt Hummel.

34:49.940 --> 34:51.510
Kurt?

34:51.560 --> 34:52.980
Stop! Kurt!

34:56.010 --> 34:58.870
I've never been so humiliated!
Kurt. Stop. Stop Kurt!

34:58.920 --> 35:00.960
Please just stop. Come on.

35:01.970 --> 35:04.010
Don't you get how stupid we were?

35:04.060 --> 35:05.980
We thought that because
no one was teasing us

35:06.030 --> 35:08.060
or beating us up
that-that no one cared.

35:08.150 --> 35:09.680
Like... like some
kind of progress

35:09.730 --> 35:11.350
had been made.

35:11.400 --> 35:13.230
But it's still the same.

35:14.900 --> 35:17.200
It's just a stupid joke.

35:17.290 --> 35:18.320
No it's not.

35:18.370 --> 35:20.360
All that hate...

35:20.410 --> 35:23.030
They were just afraid to say it out loud.

35:23.080 --> 35:26.250
So they did it by secret ballot.

35:26.330 --> 35:28.700
I'm one big anonymous practical joke.

35:28.750 --> 35:31.970
Quinn you need to calm down.
This is your fault!

35:32.040 --> 35:33.540
Nobody ever would have voted for me

35:33.590 --> 35:35.540
'cause they know he
would rather be with you.

35:35.590 --> 35:36.310
That's not true.

35:42.730 --> 35:44.230
I'm so sorry.

35:44.320 --> 35:46.820
How could my running mate win and I didn't?

35:46.880 --> 35:48.550
I mean just because I hate everybody

35:48.600 --> 35:50.640
doesn't mean they have to hate me too.

35:50.710 --> 35:54.070
It's just a stupid crown
you can buy at the Party Store.

35:54.160 --> 35:57.310
I'm gonna be an outsider my whole life.

35:57.380 --> 36:00.580
Can't I just... have one
night where I'm queen?

36:00.670 --> 36:01.870
I'm not going back in there.

36:01.920 --> 36:03.450
Where I'm accepted?

36:03.540 --> 36:05.950
No way. There's no way I'm
staying at this school

36:06.040 --> 36:07.120
I'm gonna transfer.

36:07.210 --> 36:08.590
Soon as we get to New York

36:08.670 --> 36:10.370
I'm bailing to live in a lesbian colony.

36:10.430 --> 36:13.240
Or Tribeca.

36:13.290 --> 36:15.250
Would you at least sit down?

36:17.430 --> 36:19.850
Do you want to go?

36:19.920 --> 36:22.440
We don't have to go back in there.

36:22.520 --> 36:24.760
Wasn't this prom supposed
to be about redemption?

36:24.810 --> 36:26.860
About taking away that lump you had

36:26.920 --> 36:28.530
in your throat from running away?

36:28.590 --> 36:31.480
If we leave all it's gonna do
is give me a lump too.

36:31.550 --> 36:32.810
So what do you want to do?

36:38.870 --> 36:41.990
I'm gonna go back in there
and get coronated.

36:43.910 --> 36:46.410
I'm gonna show them that
it doesn't matter if they are

36:46.460 --> 36:47.610
yelling at me

36:47.660 --> 36:49.610
or whispering behind my back

36:49.680 --> 36:51.010
they can't touch me.

36:51.080 --> 36:53.830
That they can't touch <i>us.</i>

36:55.050 --> 36:56.420
Or what we have.

36:56.470 --> 36:59.220
Most girls would be upset
about being slapped in the face

36:59.290 --> 37:01.460
but I happen to appreciate the drama of it.

37:05.100 --> 37:08.900
I know you think it's hard to be you Rachel

37:08.970 --> 37:12.070
but at least you don't have
to be terrified all the time.

37:12.140 --> 37:14.350
What are you so scared of?

37:18.140 --> 37:19.310
The future.

37:20.500 --> 37:22.830
When all this is gone.

37:22.910 --> 37:26.330
You have nothing to be scared of.

37:26.420 --> 37:29.000
You're a very pretty girl Quinn.

37:29.070 --> 37:32.510
You're the prettiest girl
I've ever met but...

37:32.570 --> 37:35.010
You're a lot more than that.

37:37.160 --> 37:38.350
Here.

37:40.350 --> 37:41.380
Can I help?

37:43.800 --> 37:45.390
They must have sensed that I was a lesbian.

37:45.470 --> 37:47.810
I mean they must have.
Do I smell like a golf course?

37:47.870 --> 37:49.170
People don't know what you're hiding

37:49.220 --> 37:51.580
they just... they know
that you're not being yourself.

37:51.640 --> 37:52.940
If you were to embrace all

37:53.010 --> 37:55.230
the awesomeness that you
are you would've won.

37:56.400 --> 37:58.080
How do you know?

37:58.150 --> 38:00.400
Because I voted for you.

38:03.460 --> 38:06.470
And because I believe in you Santana.

38:10.910 --> 38:12.810
This prom sucks!

38:14.080 --> 38:16.180
Now what am I supposed to do?

38:16.250 --> 38:18.590
Go back out there and be there for Kurt.

38:18.650 --> 38:20.840
This is gonna be a lot harder
for him than it is for you.

38:29.960 --> 38:31.430
Are you ready for this?

38:33.850 --> 38:35.490
Well Stumbles
it's 10:00 p.m.

38:35.550 --> 38:37.400
You've officially missed your prom.

38:37.490 --> 38:38.860
I'm not gonna rat somebody out

38:38.910 --> 38:40.220
for doing something that I did.

38:40.280 --> 38:41.610
I was upset

38:41.690 --> 38:43.780
and I wanted to impress a girl.

38:43.860 --> 38:45.950
But I wasn't down on
getting everybody wasted

38:46.030 --> 38:48.750
so I poured a flask of
lemonade into the punch.

38:48.830 --> 38:49.780
Wait.

38:49.870 --> 38:51.450
You didn't spike the punch?

38:51.540 --> 38:52.620
Yes I did.

38:52.700 --> 38:53.840
With alcohol?

38:53.910 --> 38:56.690
Oh. Yeah then
no I didn't.

38:56.760 --> 38:58.380
Well why didn't you tell me that before?

38:58.430 --> 39:01.090
I was just about to pull out
a couple of your molars.

39:02.580 --> 39:04.580
So can I go?

39:04.630 --> 39:06.270
You should really be ashamed of yourself.

39:06.350 --> 39:07.550
You are seriously

39:07.600 --> 39:09.690
no fun to interrogate or almost torture.

39:29.860 --> 39:30.790
Oh my God

39:30.880 --> 39:32.290
