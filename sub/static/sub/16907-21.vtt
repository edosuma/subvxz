WEBVTT

00:02.169 --> 00:03.716
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

00:03.961 --> 00:05.179
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

00:05.339 --> 00:08.934
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

00:09.218 --> 00:11.266
<i>Today, I fight that war on two fronts.</i>

00:11.553 --> 00:13.897
<i>By day, I lead Star City as its mayor.</i>

00:14.097 --> 00:15.895
<i>But by night, I'm someone else.</i>

00:16.099 --> 00:17.942
<i>I am something else.</i>

00:18.227 --> 00:20.650
<i>I am the Green Arrow.</i>

00:21.563 --> 00:22.780
Previously on Arrow...

00:22.981 --> 00:26.281
That's why you won't tell me
who Prometheus is.

00:26.652 --> 00:28.996
<i>He calls himself Adrian Chase.</i>

00:29.154 --> 00:31.031
- Who's Simon Morrison?
<i>- Adrian</i> Chase.

00:31.198 --> 00:33.292
Simon Morrison is his birth name.
That's his real identity.

00:33.450 --> 00:36.294
Daddy's decided you're gonna
come home with me. I promise.

00:36.495 --> 00:38.418
I spoke to Curtis's lawyer friend.

00:38.664 --> 00:40.587
- I put things in motion.
- Good for you.

00:40.791 --> 00:43.260
I am getting deeper and deeper
into the mud.

00:43.418 --> 00:44.795
That doesn't mean that you have to quit.

00:44.962 --> 00:48.011
I am broken, okay?
I need you to let me go.

00:48.382 --> 00:49.884
Your resignation's accepted.

00:51.843 --> 00:55.143
I don't wanna do this anymore.
I'm shutting everything down.

01:00.102 --> 01:01.319
- Hey.
- Good morning.

01:01.478 --> 01:03.355
Actually, it's a lousy one.

01:04.565 --> 01:05.566
Tell me.

01:05.732 --> 01:07.780
Last night,
Judge Balderrama granted retrials

01:07.943 --> 01:10.162
on all the cases that Chase prosecuted.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.947
Well, that's bad, but I mean, he didn't...

01:12.114 --> 01:14.788
What, release them on bail?
Yep, that happened, too.

01:14.950 --> 01:16.748
- Son of a bitch.
- That's what I said.

01:16.910 --> 01:20.005
And now we've got 36 violent felons
walking around on the streets.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.086
Well, put the most dangerous ones
under surveillance.

01:22.249 --> 01:26.629
Yeah, it's already done. Listen, Oliver,
where are we on finding Chase?

01:27.462 --> 01:29.965
Right where he is. We're nowhere.

01:30.173 --> 01:31.174
I'm sorry, Mr. Mayor,

01:31.341 --> 01:32.718
but I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave the building.

01:32.884 --> 01:33.885
What? Why?

01:34.052 --> 01:35.429
A suspicious package
was received by your office.

01:35.596 --> 01:36.643
- When?
- Just now.

01:36.805 --> 01:39.228
A large crate that set off the dogs.
Bomb squad's on the way.

01:39.391 --> 01:41.064
Well, any indication
where it was delivered from?

01:41.226 --> 01:43.604
No return address.
But the sender is a Simon Morrison.

01:45.063 --> 01:46.064
Sir, I can't allow you to...

01:46.231 --> 01:47.278
Then resign.

01:48.191 --> 01:50.694
Look, I enjoy getting blown up
just as much as the next guy,

01:50.861 --> 01:51.908
but am I missing something here?

01:52.070 --> 01:54.289
It's Chase.
Simon Morrison's his real name.

01:54.489 --> 01:56.833
Fine, but that's no reason
to get yourself, all of us, blown up.

01:56.992 --> 01:57.993
- Step away.
- Sir, we can't...

01:58.201 --> 01:59.418
I've got this. Step away.

01:59.703 --> 02:01.797
Don't worry.
He was a bomb diffuser in a past life.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.502
<i>We don't believe
it's an incendiary device.</i>

02:03.665 --> 02:06.043
Snake-cam showed the presence
of concrete and building materials.

02:06.209 --> 02:07.210
That could have set off the dogs.

02:07.377 --> 02:08.424
Concrete?

02:08.586 --> 02:10.555
Sir, protocol still requires
we wait for the bomb squad.

02:11.256 --> 02:12.428
Mr. Mayor?

02:22.851 --> 02:23.898
What the hell?

02:34.988 --> 02:36.240
Who is he?

02:36.657 --> 02:39.581
According to dental records,
Henry Goodwin.

02:39.785 --> 02:41.503
- Ring any bells?
- No, not a note.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.630
He was a Councilman in the Glades
back in'02.

02:43.789 --> 02:45.587
Chase wouldn't have been old enough
to drink back then.

02:45.791 --> 02:47.714
Right. And, so far,
there are no connections

02:47.876 --> 02:49.378
between Goodwin and Chase
that we can find.

02:49.586 --> 02:52.510
I mean, Goodwin was reported missing
in 2002, he was declared dead in '03.

02:53.048 --> 02:56.518
Question is, why would Chase
send Oliver a 15-year-old body

02:56.718 --> 02:58.595
that neither of them are connected to?

02:58.929 --> 03:01.478
No idea. Then again, Chase is crazy.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.855
Okay, pull all the forensics
that you can find.

03:04.101 --> 03:07.446
Try and find a connection
between either Chase, or his father.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.777
- Name's Justin Claybourne.
- Claybourne.

03:11.817 --> 03:13.194
And if there is no connection?

03:13.360 --> 03:15.078
There has to be a connection.

03:15.278 --> 03:18.248
Chase does everything for a reason.
We need to know what it is.

03:18.407 --> 03:19.624
It's gonna be a tall order, Oliver.

03:19.783 --> 03:22.002
We're already spread thin
keeping an eye on the guys

03:22.160 --> 03:23.628
that Chase was prosecuting who got kicked.

03:23.787 --> 03:26.506
I have asked Quentin to task the SCPD
with monitoring the dangerous ones.

03:26.665 --> 03:29.965
Which leaves us with the extremely
dangerous ones, I'm guessing.

03:31.461 --> 03:34.385
Ooh, zombie "I can't feel pain"
Derek Sampson has my vote.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.342
What's he been up to
since getting out of prison?

03:36.508 --> 03:38.260
Partying like a guy
who just got out of prison.

03:38.427 --> 03:42.022
Let's stay on him and whoever else
we think are the most dangerous.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.600
What about your office's
newest art installation,

03:44.766 --> 03:46.518
- the concrete councilman?
- Dinah's working the evidence.

03:46.852 --> 03:48.229
She gets a lead, we make a move.

03:54.025 --> 03:55.277
<i>He'!-</i>

03:56.111 --> 03:58.159
How is it going with...

03:58.780 --> 03:59.906
- William?
- Yep.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.326
I'm actually having trouble finding him.

04:02.492 --> 04:04.961
Samantha did a really good job
at hiding herself and William.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.839
Well, if Felicity Smoak can't find him,

04:07.998 --> 04:10.922
I feel better about Chase
not being able to, so, thank you.

04:20.761 --> 04:24.015
Maybe drinking before flying
not such good idea.

04:25.348 --> 04:27.567
Or not drink enough. I don't know.

04:27.851 --> 04:30.695
Weather's getting worse.
Means we're close.

04:30.854 --> 04:32.447
I pretend that is good thing.

04:32.606 --> 04:35.450
All this time, you never mentioning
you know how to fly. Where you learn?

04:35.692 --> 04:37.365
Yeah, my dad loved vintage planes.

04:37.527 --> 04:40.997
He would take me up all the time.
One of my last happy memories.

04:41.198 --> 04:42.825
I'm guessing this not one of them.

04:43.033 --> 04:44.785
<i>I'm not the man you think I am, Oliver.</i>

04:44.951 --> 04:46.874
<i>I didn't save our city. I failed it.</i>

04:47.245 --> 04:48.838
<i>I did a terrible thing.</i>

04:49.080 --> 04:50.377
<i>You can right my wrongs.</i>

04:51.374 --> 04:54.378
<i>You can save this city.</i>

04:54.669 --> 04:55.841
Why you want me watching this?

04:56.046 --> 04:58.265
So you can understand
why I have to go back.

04:58.840 --> 05:02.390
To Starling City,
or to this horrible place?

05:08.725 --> 05:11.228
Ooh. That frown mean you struck out?

05:11.895 --> 05:13.021
Mmm. Not exactly.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.031
Concrete's a proprietary formula.

05:15.190 --> 05:17.443
It's owned by
a specific construction company.

05:17.692 --> 05:20.286
Killer's DNA
is underneath Goodwin's fingernails.

05:20.445 --> 05:23.289
All right, so what's with the loser look?
You can't ID a suspect off all that?

05:23.448 --> 05:27.078
The "loser look" is because
I did ID a suspect off all that.

05:34.251 --> 05:36.549
Now, the bond offering
should pay for all the overtime

05:36.711 --> 05:38.429
I'm asking the SCPD for

05:38.588 --> 05:41.842
in order to keep track
of Chase's violent felons.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.269
Clear the room for a second, please.

05:53.061 --> 05:54.404
I missed you.

05:56.022 --> 06:00.027
Yeah, well, once I heard
that Chase was Prometheus,

06:00.193 --> 06:02.787
- I knew you'd drag me back to town.
- For your protection.

06:02.946 --> 06:07.452
And say that. Ollie, I think you know
I can take care of myself.

06:07.617 --> 06:10.336
It has nothing to do
with what you're capable of, Thea.

06:10.787 --> 06:13.336
It has to do with
what Adrian Chase is capable of.

06:13.498 --> 06:16.342
You mean an Oscar-worthy performance
of a decent human being?

06:16.668 --> 06:17.669
As betrayals go,

06:17.836 --> 06:20.510
it makes Isabel Rochev
look like a bad practical joke.

06:20.672 --> 06:22.265
I'm sure. But I...

06:22.465 --> 06:27.062
I know Chase is dangerous
and I know you're worried,

06:28.346 --> 06:30.394
but I just...
I wasn't ready to come back yet.

06:30.807 --> 06:33.026
Were you with Roy or...

06:33.226 --> 06:35.695
Like I'd let him see me
in the state I'm in.

06:35.937 --> 06:37.029
What state are you in?

06:37.230 --> 06:39.699
Phrase "hot mess" comes to mind.

06:41.526 --> 06:44.200
I don't know.
I'm figuring it out.

06:44.571 --> 06:47.120
I'm glad. It's good to see you.

06:48.825 --> 06:49.826
Oliver, I...

06:50.452 --> 06:52.375
Thea. What are you doing here?

06:52.537 --> 06:54.335
It's nice to see you, too.

06:54.497 --> 06:55.498
No, sorry, I just...

06:55.665 --> 06:58.009
It's great to see you, it's just...

06:58.251 --> 06:59.878
Well, it's just bad timing is all.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.220
Maybe we should do this in private.

07:01.379 --> 07:02.471
This regarding Councilman Goodwin?

07:02.797 --> 07:04.891
You know, yeah, I think maybe
we should come back later.

07:05.050 --> 07:07.223
- What is going on?
- Chase sent a 15-year-old corpse

07:07.385 --> 07:10.309
to my office this morning
as some kind of message.

07:11.348 --> 07:12.440
Do we have a suspect?

07:12.599 --> 07:13.851
Yeah, you could say that.

07:14.684 --> 07:15.856
Okay.

07:18.355 --> 07:19.356
Who is it?

07:20.357 --> 07:21.404
It's your father.

07:29.699 --> 07:32.452
This is Chase, obviously.
He's framing our father.

07:32.702 --> 07:33.999
Yeah, but to what end?

07:34.162 --> 07:36.039
The concrete came
from Wellward Construction,

07:36.206 --> 07:38.584
which was a subsidiary
of Queen Consolidated.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.673
And the skin
under the victim's fingernails

07:40.835 --> 07:42.382
matches Mr. Queen's DNA.

07:42.671 --> 07:44.389
And the problem is, all those forensics

07:44.547 --> 07:46.174
passed through a whole lot of labs.

07:46.383 --> 07:48.681
You can't keep this
from going public, can you?

07:48.843 --> 07:51.687
Not for lack of trying, believe me.
I'm sorry, Oliver.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.182
Dinah, I need you to get
DNA and concrete samples

07:54.349 --> 07:55.350
to Felicity and Curtis.

07:55.558 --> 07:58.232
Our father is being framed,
and we need to start to prove it.

07:58.395 --> 08:00.397
Sure, a couple pieces of evidence
can go missing.

08:00.563 --> 08:01.564
And what are you gonna be doing?

08:01.731 --> 08:03.233
Holding a press conference.

08:03.566 --> 08:06.069
I just weathered a scandal.
I need to get out in front of this one.

08:10.532 --> 08:13.627
Okay, I think you should reconsider
doing this whole press conference.

08:14.244 --> 08:15.416
- Why?
- Because this could be

08:15.578 --> 08:17.501
what Chase is manipulating you into.

08:17.664 --> 08:20.383
Just like he manipulated you
into the impeachment

08:20.542 --> 08:22.294
by throwing Green Arrow under the bus.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.087
But like with the impeachment,
I need to tell...

08:24.254 --> 08:25.551
Lie to the press?

08:25.755 --> 08:29.760
Because that's what you're gonna be doing
if we find out that Dad is guilty.

08:29.968 --> 08:31.094
Thea, come on.

08:31.261 --> 08:34.856
Look, I am just saying, what if?

08:35.765 --> 08:37.482
It's not like our parents were saints.

08:37.808 --> 08:39.482
Chase thinks I'm a killer.

08:39.644 --> 08:41.486
What he's doing, this whole setup,

08:41.688 --> 08:45.568
is him trying to convince me
that our father was the same way.

08:47.110 --> 08:49.158
Our father was a lot of things.

08:50.155 --> 08:51.953
He's not a cold-blooded murderer.

08:54.993 --> 08:57.291
Can't believe you convinced me
to come back to this island.

08:57.454 --> 08:59.377
Fly home any time you want, Anatoly.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.792
You have irony back in America, yes?

09:01.958 --> 09:04.757
To do what I have to do, no one
can know what I've been through.

09:07.297 --> 09:08.970
You mean in Russia?

09:10.133 --> 09:11.350
In Russia.

09:12.635 --> 09:13.978
In Hong Kong.

09:14.679 --> 09:18.149
How do I explain to my family
why I didn't come home sooner?

09:19.142 --> 09:22.988
You know, it's easier
if I'm just a simple castaway.

09:23.146 --> 09:24.819
There's no such thing as simple castaway.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.574
You know what I mean. Just...

09:26.733 --> 09:30.613
It will be easier to keep my cover
if no one is asking questions.

09:38.995 --> 09:40.087
That's a bad omen.

09:40.789 --> 09:41.915
He was my friend.

09:42.332 --> 09:44.334
If that was true,
he would not have tried to kill us.

09:50.340 --> 09:51.341
What are you doing?

09:51.508 --> 09:55.058
Well, this just washed up on the shore
like some kind of sign.

09:56.179 --> 09:57.476
Yeah, that you're crazy.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.191
Come on.

10:00.683 --> 10:01.935
Where are we going?

10:02.602 --> 10:06.982
I'm taking you somewhere to explain
why I'm doing what I'm doing.

10:07.857 --> 10:11.031
I spent a year on this island.
You never told me there was a bar.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.124
Hey. You busy?

10:16.741 --> 10:18.994
Uh. Yeah. I'm just going over
Councilman Goodwin's appointments.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.379
I'm looking for an alibi
for Oliver's father.

10:21.871 --> 10:23.544
I thought you were on freed felon patrol.

10:23.706 --> 10:25.424
Just got some good news,
figured I'd share it.

10:25.583 --> 10:26.630
Please.

10:26.876 --> 10:29.049
Good news is in short supply around here.

10:29.212 --> 10:30.213
Got a court date.

10:30.380 --> 10:32.428
Ha! Finally. You're getting prosecuted.
That is good news.

10:32.590 --> 10:34.137
Funny. It's for Zoe.

10:34.926 --> 10:36.803
Lawyer thinks I can get expedited custody.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.684
Oh, wow, that's terrific.

10:38.930 --> 10:40.432
Huh, good for you, hoss.

10:41.850 --> 10:46.947
I thought maybe, you know,
since you gave me the push, you...

10:47.230 --> 10:48.652
You'd...

10:50.191 --> 10:51.568
Show up for moral support?

10:54.195 --> 10:55.287
It'd be an honor.

10:57.490 --> 10:58.537
Now, get out of here.

11:04.122 --> 11:06.250
- Got your 911 call.
- Gas chromatograph kicked back

11:06.416 --> 11:08.544
something very interesting
on that concrete.

11:08.793 --> 11:11.546
Traces of soil with high levels
of copper concentration.

11:12.547 --> 11:14.515
Yeah, I think you and I
have very different ideas

11:14.674 --> 11:16.597
of what "interesting" means.

11:17.552 --> 11:20.431
Well, I cross-referenced
Queen Consolidated construction locations

11:20.597 --> 11:22.474
with areas in the city
rich in copper, and...

11:22.640 --> 11:24.563
And you think you know
where Goodwin was killed.

11:24.726 --> 11:26.399
Well, nothing concrete.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.563
But yeah.
If Chase is trying to send a message...

11:28.730 --> 11:30.277
It might be saying, "Come find me."

11:30.440 --> 11:32.568
Okay, send this address to Oliver.
I'll meet him there.

11:32.734 --> 11:33.735
What about Curtis and Dinah?

11:33.902 --> 11:36.121
They are staking out Derek Sampson.

11:39.657 --> 11:41.659
Looks like
Sampson's not finished partying.

11:42.243 --> 11:45.292
<i>Except he's moved on from strippers
to M4 assault rifles.</i>

11:45.622 --> 11:46.839
Should we move on him?

11:48.124 --> 11:49.467
For all we know,
those guns could be legal.

11:49.626 --> 11:51.799
So, if we go in now, the SCPD
might not have enough evidence

11:51.961 --> 11:53.087
to put him back behind bars.

11:53.254 --> 11:54.346
Exactly.

11:54.631 --> 11:56.304
- So, what do we do?
- We wait.

11:56.633 --> 11:57.805
See what his plan is.

11:58.218 --> 12:01.688
Trust me, when it comes to this guy
it's absolutely nothing good.

12:04.682 --> 12:05.683
Anything?

12:05.892 --> 12:07.314
Former Oliver Enterprises.

12:07.477 --> 12:09.855
Used to be a Queen Consolidated
holding company back in the day.

12:10.021 --> 12:11.443
I know, my father brought me here
when I was younger.

12:11.606 --> 12:12.653
Said the building was named after me.

12:12.815 --> 12:14.488
Felicity says it's been abandoned
for about a month

12:14.651 --> 12:16.198
due to some "toxic gas leak."

12:16.361 --> 12:17.658
Chase wanted everyone cleared out.

12:17.820 --> 12:18.912
Seems that way.

12:19.322 --> 12:20.619
Hell of a big building.

12:20.782 --> 12:22.625
If he's in there,
we should get started.

12:24.327 --> 12:25.795
If Chase wanted you here for some reason,

12:25.954 --> 12:28.173
he could've been more specific
about which floor.

12:28.331 --> 12:29.799
Overwatch, can you
narrow the search for us?

12:30.124 --> 12:31.467
Well, normally, yes, but right now

12:31.626 --> 12:34.675
the only heat signatures
I'm reading in there are you two.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.179
- You all right?
- Yeah, wasn't much of a fall.

12:45.139 --> 12:46.231
What's Chase playing at?

12:50.979 --> 12:52.026
I had to ask.

12:52.855 --> 12:53.856
It's concrete.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.360
He's trying to bury us alive
just like Councilman Goodwin.

13:06.911 --> 13:08.959
If you have one of those
smart ideas, I'm in the market.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.214
After all these months,

13:10.373 --> 13:13.217
I refuse to believe
this is Chase's endgame. Overwatch.

13:13.376 --> 13:15.595
Okay. I'm dialing up a rescue,
but it's gonna take a few minutes.

13:15.753 --> 13:17.630
I'm not sure how many more
of those minutes we've got!

13:21.467 --> 13:22.639
Okay. Here we go.

13:22.802 --> 13:23.928
<i>Guys, we got</i> a <i>situation.</i>

13:24.095 --> 13:25.722
- Yeah, so do we.
- Sampson's on the move.

13:25.888 --> 13:27.185
You're gonna have to
let him make it without you.

13:27.348 --> 13:28.395
Oliver and Digg are in trouble.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.568
Chase is going through
a lot of trouble to prove a point.

13:34.731 --> 13:35.778
What the hell is his point?

13:36.024 --> 13:37.822
He framed my father
for the same kind of murder.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.032
Proves the apple
doesn't fall far from the tree, huh?

13:40.194 --> 13:42.572
You both might be killers, Oliver,
but he's a psychopath.

13:42.739 --> 13:43.740
Don't lose sight of that.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.123
Were you assuming that
we're getting out of this?

13:45.283 --> 13:46.535
Yes, lam.

13:48.411 --> 13:49.628
It's Morse Code.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.748
"Get clear."

14:03.760 --> 14:05.103
You two all right?

14:08.765 --> 14:10.938
So we had to move off
the Sampson stakeout?

14:11.142 --> 14:13.144
Yes, because John and you

14:13.311 --> 14:16.190
were re-enacting the paleo version
of my favorite scene from Witness.

14:16.981 --> 14:19.780
Harrison Ford almost getting buried
under the corn in the barn silo.

14:19.942 --> 14:20.943
- That's the one.
- Oh, right.

14:21.110 --> 14:23.283
And for those of us who
haven't seen every movie ever,

14:23.446 --> 14:24.663
they mean it was a trap.

14:24.822 --> 14:26.824
<i>- Who hasn't seen Witness?
- Or</i> a <i>distraction.</i>

14:27.075 --> 14:29.123
I'll bet real money
that Sampson's working with Chase.

14:29.285 --> 14:30.286
Makes sense.

14:30.453 --> 14:32.501
Chase is the reason
Sampson got out of prison.

14:32.830 --> 14:35.629
What did Sampson pull down while
Curtis and Dinah were saving the day?

14:35.792 --> 14:36.918
They broke into a nearby lab.

14:37.085 --> 14:38.428
- To steal what?
- That's the thing.

14:38.586 --> 14:40.304
The chemicals they stole,
torinium and lydracide,

14:40.463 --> 14:42.181
they have absolutely zero street value.

14:42.340 --> 14:44.889
Torinium and lydracide.
Where have I heard those two before?

14:45.051 --> 14:47.349
It's two of the three components
that Justin Claybourne was using

14:47.512 --> 14:50.732
to weaponize tuberculosis
in Lamb Valley five years ago.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.517
You said Claybourne was Chase's father.

14:52.683 --> 14:53.684
He's dredging up the past.

14:53.976 --> 14:56.650
In the case
of Councilman Goodwin, literally.

14:56.854 --> 14:58.151
For a reason.

14:58.314 --> 15:00.282
- What was the third chemical?
<i>- Cyclotrizane.</i>

15:00.441 --> 15:01.442
But it's highly unstable,

15:01.609 --> 15:02.906
so it was banned
from all domestic manufacturing.

15:03.069 --> 15:05.788
Which'll make it incredibly difficult
for Sampson to get his hands on

15:05.947 --> 15:09.918
in case Chase is trying to live out
his dad's evil plan.

15:10.076 --> 15:11.703
- Chase will find a way.
- To what end?

15:11.869 --> 15:14.338
John's right.
I mean, if there's a connection

15:14.497 --> 15:17.751
between Chase's father and framing yours,
I don't know what it is.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.670
We might've found someone
that can help with that.

15:21.212 --> 15:22.555
<i>Darren Coffman.</i>

15:22.713 --> 15:25.011
Last dude Councilman Goodwin saw
before he disappeared.

15:25.174 --> 15:26.926
SCPD interviewed him back in '02,

15:27.093 --> 15:29.187
but we think
they didn't get the whole story.

15:29.345 --> 15:30.892
Coffman was Goodwin's lawyer.

15:31.055 --> 15:32.523
<i>But not just his lawyer.</i>

15:33.141 --> 15:36.111
Coffman also represented Chase's old man.

15:40.189 --> 15:43.910
Mr. Coffman, thank you for coming
on such short notice.

15:44.527 --> 15:45.744
This is my sister, Thea.

15:46.404 --> 15:47.451
<i>DARREN". Pleasure.</i>

15:47.822 --> 15:51.497
Your office didn't mention
why you wanted to see me.

15:51.784 --> 15:54.754
It's regarding the recent reports
about our father.

15:56.164 --> 15:58.963
I never had the opportunity to meet him,

15:59.125 --> 16:02.220
but your father did
some remarkable things for this city.

16:02.545 --> 16:06.721
What's happening with his reputation
right now is simply terrible,

16:06.883 --> 16:09.762
but I can't understand
what it could have to do with me.

16:09.927 --> 16:12.897
Reportedly, you were the last person
seen with Councilman Goodwin.

16:14.098 --> 16:17.944
I'm sympathetic to your desire
to identify a suspect

16:18.186 --> 16:21.690
who isn't your father, but...

16:25.735 --> 16:28.113
- What's this?
- I have no idea.

16:28.529 --> 16:30.281
But I was asked to give it to you.

16:30.615 --> 16:32.333
- By who?
- Adrian Chase.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.749
Or, as I knew him, Simon Morrison.

16:35.912 --> 16:37.960
You've been in contact with him?

16:38.748 --> 16:40.546
Why didn't you alert the SCPD?

16:40.708 --> 16:42.756
You've met him. You know why.

16:42.919 --> 16:45.763
The man is terrifying, and smart.

16:46.631 --> 16:48.429
He said you'd seek me out.

16:48.716 --> 16:50.969
And that when you did,
I should give you that.

16:51.260 --> 16:55.140
He said it proves the kind of man
your father truly was.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.942
I know what kind of man our father was.

16:58.100 --> 17:01.354
And he was nowhere close
to Chase's father.

17:01.646 --> 17:03.523
You were Justin Claybourne's lawyer.

17:03.856 --> 17:07.201
You must know something about him,
something about his son.

17:07.359 --> 17:09.704
Attorney-client confidentiality.

17:10.320 --> 17:12.915
I couldn't tell you anything
even if I wanted to.

17:13.074 --> 17:15.452
Actually, I think you want to.

17:15.617 --> 17:16.743
Thea, easy.

17:18.079 --> 17:19.422
What do you know?

17:25.377 --> 17:26.378
"Taiana."

17:26.796 --> 17:28.639
ls that the one you killed Kovar for?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.051
That's my father.

17:32.969 --> 17:36.223
He's the reason I have to go back
the way I have to go back.

17:36.681 --> 17:37.898
That video.

17:38.683 --> 17:40.435
He wants you to save your home.

17:40.685 --> 17:43.313
I do not think <i>kapiushon</i>
is what he had in mind.

17:43.479 --> 17:45.902
Putting on the hood is the only way
I know how to save my city.

17:46.399 --> 17:49.198
I told you, Oliver,
hood is just piece of cloth.

17:50.194 --> 17:51.696
Not that you listen to me anyway.

17:51.862 --> 17:54.160
The hood, Anatoly, is an identity.

17:54.448 --> 17:56.746
One, you think,
channels monster inside you.

17:56.909 --> 17:59.287
And protects the people
that are closest to me.

17:59.495 --> 18:02.248
I do it this way,
my enemies will target the hood,

18:03.082 --> 18:04.504
not the ones I care for.

18:04.750 --> 18:07.503
You are many things, Oliver Queen,

18:07.670 --> 18:10.844
but until today, I did not count
naive as one of them.

18:11.757 --> 18:14.510
<i>The people closest to you will always
pay the most for your sins.</i>

18:15.511 --> 18:17.479
<i>You are paying for your father's.</i>

18:18.806 --> 18:20.228
Who will pay for yours?

18:31.027 --> 18:32.449
I'm gonna destroy it.

18:32.737 --> 18:34.364
Well, don't you wanna see
what's on it first?

18:34.530 --> 18:35.782
- No.
- Why not?

18:35.948 --> 18:37.746
Because Chase wants me to.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.498
I've had my fill
of playing his mind games.

18:43.456 --> 18:44.503
- Yeah.
- Dinah and Curtis

18:44.665 --> 18:46.133
tracked Sampson to Fairbanks Chemical,

18:46.292 --> 18:48.920
a military contractor who sold
a whole lot of cyclotrizane

18:49.086 --> 18:50.087
to the US government.

18:50.254 --> 18:52.348
Text me the address. I'll meet them there.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.764
You want to come with,
for old times' sake?

18:56.385 --> 18:58.638
I think old times should stay old times.

19:14.737 --> 19:17.456
- Keep it going. We're halfway there.
- Hold it.

19:27.249 --> 19:28.501
Pain's just another prison.

19:29.919 --> 19:31.091
And I'm a free man.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.929
To the next batch.
Hurry up, we've got more assigned.

19:40.763 --> 19:43.266
Move out.
Sampson doesn't leave with the chemicals.

19:44.642 --> 19:47.646
Gilmour, you guys coming back
for more of this stuff or what?

19:48.270 --> 19:49.271
Gilmour.

19:51.107 --> 19:52.108
They're here.

20:12.294 --> 20:13.511
Where's your green friend?

20:13.671 --> 20:15.298
I was really looking forward
to killing him.

20:36.861 --> 20:38.659
We need to check to see
if this is cyclotrizane.

20:38.821 --> 20:39.822
On it.

20:39.989 --> 20:41.832
Ten'll get you 20,
that's exactly what this is.

20:41.991 --> 20:43.413
<i>One thing at</i> a <i>time.</i>

20:43.617 --> 20:45.244
- Go.
- Hey. Thea called.

20:45.411 --> 20:47.288
She said she needs to talk to you.
Said it was important.

20:50.082 --> 20:54.132
Thea, I thought that we agreed
not to look at whatever's on that drive.

20:54.295 --> 20:56.013
Ollie, you have a habit of giving orders

20:56.172 --> 20:59.016
and just assuming that they're agreements.

20:59.175 --> 21:01.598
- But you have got to see this.
- No, I don't.

21:01.886 --> 21:03.684
It's security footage

21:03.846 --> 21:07.851
from the Oliver Enterprises
construction site back in 2002.

21:08.309 --> 21:10.528
Dad must've confiscated it and...

21:11.687 --> 21:13.030
Chase must've found it.

21:13.189 --> 21:14.907
Thea, listen to me.

21:15.107 --> 21:19.408
Ollie, I know what you are about to say,
and I don't...

21:19.653 --> 21:21.371
I don't see how this could be fake.

21:22.490 --> 21:23.491
Please.

22:05.491 --> 22:07.539
Before he died, Dad said to me,

22:08.285 --> 22:11.755
"Oliver, lam not the man you think I am."

22:14.917 --> 22:16.294
And I should've believed him.

22:17.086 --> 22:18.178
Are you okay?

22:18.420 --> 22:19.467
Are you?

22:20.297 --> 22:21.298
No.

22:21.841 --> 22:25.596
But once you find out
Malcolm Merlyn's your biological father,

22:25.761 --> 22:28.105
you can pretty much handle anything.

22:29.014 --> 22:32.439
Between him and Mom,

22:33.936 --> 22:36.359
and being raised by Dad,

22:37.439 --> 22:40.864
it really is no surprise
I turned out to be such a monster.

22:41.026 --> 22:43.279
You're not a monster, and neither was Dad.

22:43.445 --> 22:45.322
Yeah, maybe you should
re-watch that video.

22:45.489 --> 22:49.869
No. Once was enough. That was an accident.

22:50.035 --> 22:52.413
Yeah, an accident
that he tried to cover up.

22:53.122 --> 22:56.717
Ollie, our parents
may have loved us, but...

22:59.128 --> 23:02.257
That love does not make up

23:02.423 --> 23:05.302
for all the terrible things
that they have done.

23:07.344 --> 23:11.440
And maybe the most terrible thing of all
was making us just like them.

23:20.816 --> 23:21.817
I have to go.

23:26.071 --> 23:27.323
Are you gonna be okay?

23:27.531 --> 23:30.580
Yeah, I always am.

23:36.290 --> 23:37.667
Okay, let's go over the plan.

23:37.833 --> 23:42.009
Ugh, Oliver, we've been over, and over,
and over plan. I'm not that drunk.

23:43.047 --> 23:44.344
Humor me.

23:45.090 --> 23:46.342
I find boat.

23:46.508 --> 23:48.101
Fishermen, most likely.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.058
- Bribe them to sail here.
- In 48 hours.

23:50.596 --> 23:51.688
<i>Da</i>, in two days.

23:53.057 --> 23:57.437
You get their attention with bonfire,
then sail away home. A castaway.

23:57.603 --> 23:58.855
Thank you, Anatoly.

23:59.063 --> 24:00.485
Thank me for this.

24:02.191 --> 24:03.192
What do we have here?

24:03.359 --> 24:05.032
Proof that although I think
your plan is crazy,

24:05.194 --> 24:06.491
I'm good enough friend to help.

24:06.737 --> 24:10.617
It's from old friend of mine. Former KGB.
Man was chameleon.

24:10.783 --> 24:13.957
This is... This is very smart, Anatoly.

24:15.537 --> 24:17.960
I figured nobody would believe
there is barber shop on island.

24:20.918 --> 24:22.044
Anatoly...

24:23.337 --> 24:27.592
Last time we say goodbye, it took us years
before we see each other again.

24:28.425 --> 24:31.770
How about, <i>Ne dumay plokho obo mne.</i>

24:33.347 --> 24:35.099
How about <i>prochnost.</i>

24:35.599 --> 24:37.727
<i>Prochnost. Yeah.</i>

24:44.441 --> 24:46.739
You'll always be my brother, Oliver.

25:00.666 --> 25:01.918
What's going on?

25:02.209 --> 25:04.428
Curtis just finished his analysis
of the cyclotrizane.

25:04.586 --> 25:06.554
Remember how we thought
Chase was following Daddy's footsteps

25:06.714 --> 25:07.886
to recreate his TB epidemic?

25:08.048 --> 25:09.595
Surprise, Chase's plan is worse.

25:09.758 --> 25:11.556
The chemicals Sampson stole
are more refined

25:11.760 --> 25:14.604
than the ones Justin Claybourne used,
and could produce a biological agent

25:14.763 --> 25:17.016
- a thousand times more powerful.
- And without a cure.

25:17.182 --> 25:18.183
How would Chase distribute it?

25:18.350 --> 25:20.023
It's aerosolized,
so pretty much any way he wants.

25:20.185 --> 25:21.778
We have to find out where
Chase is storing this thing,

25:21.937 --> 25:23.109
and stop him before he releases it.

25:23.272 --> 25:24.649
Cyclotrizane degrades pretty quickly.

25:24.815 --> 25:26.488
Which means that it gives off
trackable emissions.

25:26.650 --> 25:27.651
It might.

25:28.152 --> 25:30.780
If they find a location we are gonna
need all hands on deck.

25:30.946 --> 25:32.619
- Where is Rene?
- With Lance.

25:33.282 --> 25:34.408
Said it was personal.

25:38.662 --> 25:40.790
So, how long you known about this?

25:40.956 --> 25:42.458
Lawyer called me this afternoon.

25:42.624 --> 25:45.969
Right, so what's the big deal?
You already knew you had a court date.

25:46.128 --> 25:47.425
But not a hearing.

25:48.255 --> 25:51.134
I thought this was gonna be a cakewalk,
but the judge,

25:51.300 --> 25:53.428
- she wants me to testify.
- So?

25:53.594 --> 25:55.892
So it's gonna traumatize Zoe
all over again.

25:56.263 --> 25:59.267
<i>She's gonna have to listen to me
talk about her mother's drug addiction</i>

25:59.433 --> 26:00.650
and how she got shot?

26:01.727 --> 26:04.071
And everything that
I put her through after that? No...

26:05.064 --> 26:06.361
She shouldn't have to relive all that.

26:06.523 --> 26:07.900
All right, but what's the answer?

26:08.067 --> 26:10.320
You don't show
and she loses her father all over again.

26:10.486 --> 26:14.366
- Hoss, you met her foster mom, right?
- Yeah?

26:14.656 --> 26:16.283
She's giving Zoe a good life.

26:16.617 --> 26:20.167
I show up to that courtroom,
I'm doing it for me, not for my daughter.

26:20.329 --> 26:23.003
No, if you don't step into that courtroom,

26:23.165 --> 26:26.089
that little girl spends the rest
of her life thinking you didn't want her.

26:26.335 --> 26:28.508
Maybe it's better that way, right?

26:28.670 --> 26:31.799
I mean, come on, we both know
I'm no prize, hoss.

26:31.965 --> 26:33.342
- Come on, man.
- And this is way before

26:33.509 --> 26:36.558
I put on that hockey mask
and started throwing down with human scum.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.222
This is just the nerves talking,
all right?

26:38.388 --> 26:39.435
You're just looking for a way out.

26:39.598 --> 26:41.692
Listen to me, you go into that courtroom,

26:41.850 --> 26:44.194
sure, Zoe's got to relive
some real bad times,

26:45.187 --> 26:46.279
but for the rest of... Look at me.

26:46.438 --> 26:52.366
For the rest of her life, the new memories
that she's gonna have...

26:55.906 --> 26:57.908
You get to make sure they're great,
all right?

26:58.075 --> 27:00.419
And you get to decide
how she remembers you.

27:03.747 --> 27:05.044
Please, Rene.

27:10.796 --> 27:16.303
<i>I always told myself everything I did,
I did for my family.</i>

27:18.637 --> 27:19.980
<i>That's a lie.</i>

27:20.556 --> 27:24.606
<i>Because what good is a family
without a soul?</i>

27:26.353 --> 27:27.821
<i>You can right my wrongs.</i>

27:29.064 --> 27:32.284
<i>You can be better than I was.</i>

27:34.820 --> 27:37.573
<i>You can save this city.</i>

27:41.410 --> 27:43.208
No pressure or anything.

27:45.581 --> 27:47.709
Is this the video you said
your father left for you?

27:47.875 --> 27:48.876
Yep.

27:49.293 --> 27:51.261
He left one for Thea, too.

27:51.587 --> 27:53.055
I never showed it to her.

27:53.213 --> 27:54.385
Why not?

27:54.548 --> 27:58.428
Because he asked her
to always watch over me,

27:58.594 --> 28:01.097
and I didn't wanna burden her with that.

28:01.847 --> 28:04.475
Hmm. Sounds like
typical Oliver Queen thinking.

28:07.603 --> 28:09.276
Why are you re-watching it?

28:11.607 --> 28:13.450
I wanna know how I missed it.

28:14.443 --> 28:16.445
- Missed what?
- He's a murderer.

28:19.323 --> 28:22.827
I mean, he helped Merlyn
start the Undertaking.

28:23.785 --> 28:26.334
I've never deluded myself
into thinking that he was a saint,

28:26.496 --> 28:29.500
but to take a man's life, cover it up...

28:32.878 --> 28:35.506
It's like I didn't know him at all.

28:36.381 --> 28:38.930
Has it occurred to you that
this is exactly what Chase wants?

28:39.176 --> 28:40.803
- Mmm-hmm.
- Okay, the question was rhetorical.

28:40.969 --> 28:43.188
Of course, it's occurred to you.
Of course this is what Chase wants.

28:43.347 --> 28:45.941
Chase wants to destroy the basis

28:47.059 --> 28:48.276
for everything that we're doing here.

28:48.435 --> 28:52.030
And that crusade began with my father.

28:52.898 --> 28:56.198
Everything that I've done, everything,

28:56.360 --> 28:58.988
has, in some way, been about honoring him.

29:01.114 --> 29:04.869
Your father inspired you
to save this city.

29:05.994 --> 29:07.337
And you did.

29:08.455 --> 29:10.674
Okay, at this point, who cares why?

29:11.500 --> 29:12.877
You're not a killer.

29:13.335 --> 29:15.804
The people you care about
are not suffering because of you.

29:15.963 --> 29:20.309
Their life, my life is better because
you decided to become the Green Arrow.

29:22.386 --> 29:26.232
Well, whenever you decide to become
the Green Arrow again.

29:28.141 --> 29:29.518
I know you're right.

29:30.560 --> 29:35.361
I believe that you're right,
but every time I take a step forward,

29:35.524 --> 29:37.777
it feels like the past is pulling me back.

29:37.985 --> 29:39.532
Probably because you're letting it.

29:39.820 --> 29:41.037
Yeah.

29:41.738 --> 29:44.082
Maybe it's time to stop
living for your father,

29:44.241 --> 29:45.788
and start living for yourself.

29:47.536 --> 29:49.538
Just leave the past in the past.

29:54.167 --> 29:56.295
Cyclotrizane emissions trace came back.

29:56.461 --> 29:58.304
Computer's been working on
a probable location...

29:58.463 --> 29:59.840
What is it?

30:12.185 --> 30:13.437
Nice.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.073
What made you decide to put it back on?

30:17.274 --> 30:18.901
Felicity has a way with words.

30:19.109 --> 30:22.238
Dinah and Rene are also on site.
No sign of Chase or Sampson.

30:22.404 --> 30:25.453
Actually, we found Sampson
and his buddies on the roof.

30:25.615 --> 30:28.585
And they've got
their super-toxic gas with them.

30:28.744 --> 30:31.213
Copy. Tell Wild Dog to sit tight
until we get there.

30:31.413 --> 30:33.040
Why'd he say I had to sit tight?

30:34.416 --> 30:35.759
Because he knows you.

30:36.001 --> 30:37.002
Oh.

30:47.679 --> 30:49.147
Go to the roof. Stop Sampson.

30:49.306 --> 30:50.853
- What about him?
- He's mine!

31:07.949 --> 31:10.202
And I'm the one that's gotta sit tight?

31:35.435 --> 31:37.403
Terrific, disarm that thing.
We'll cover you.

31:37.562 --> 31:38.905
Okay, please do.
'Cause I don't enjoy being shot.

31:39.064 --> 31:40.236
Go!

32:06.842 --> 32:08.890
Don't worry. I'll make it quick.

32:09.052 --> 32:11.726
And thank you for making me the way I am.

32:48.508 --> 32:50.510
How'd you think you were gonna
beat me, Oliver?

32:50.677 --> 32:52.930
We were trained by the same teacher.

32:53.138 --> 32:55.391
<i>Just one of the many things
that we have in common.</i>

32:55.849 --> 32:58.944
You know, like both our fathers
being horrible men.

32:59.102 --> 33:00.900
I am not my father.

33:01.688 --> 33:02.940
I'm my own man!

33:03.106 --> 33:05.700
Yeah, a man who's gonna die
knowing that my father's legacy

33:05.859 --> 33:09.363
killed everyone in the city
he loves so much.

33:09.529 --> 33:11.076
Your father's legacy?

33:13.033 --> 33:14.250
That's almost funny.

33:14.534 --> 33:15.706
What are you talking about?

33:17.370 --> 33:19.464
What are you talking about?

33:19.623 --> 33:21.876
What's so funny about my father's legacy?

33:25.212 --> 33:28.933
If that son of a bitch even looks like
he's getting loose, light him up.

33:29.257 --> 33:32.682
Copy that. I really want to know
what it takes to kill this son of a bitch.

33:33.929 --> 33:35.931
- Terrific?
- Give me a minute.

33:36.181 --> 33:37.649
Yeah, tell that to the city.

33:38.266 --> 33:40.940
The pressure really isn't...

33:42.229 --> 33:43.230
Helping.

33:44.564 --> 33:45.816
Are we good?

33:46.441 --> 33:49.160
We're terrific.
I've been waiting to use that.

33:49.319 --> 33:50.741
What about Green Arrow?

33:51.947 --> 33:55.292
Goodwin's lawyer,
he represented your father.

33:55.450 --> 33:56.576
I knew that already.

33:56.743 --> 33:59.371
You don't know
what your father asked him to do.

34:00.539 --> 34:01.540
Adrian...

34:03.416 --> 34:05.464
He was going to disown you.

34:08.463 --> 34:11.967
Not because you were illegitimate,

34:12.132 --> 34:13.510
because you're insane.

34:15.344 --> 34:18.895
You're sick and your father knew it.

34:20.600 --> 34:24.355
<i>You've spent all this time trying to honor
the memory of a man</i>

34:24.521 --> 34:26.819
<i>who was ashamed of you.</i>

34:28.483 --> 34:30.406
Now, my father wasn't perfect,

34:32.404 --> 34:36.659
but at least I know he never
would have given up on me.

35:03.727 --> 35:05.104
Go ahead.

35:06.896 --> 35:08.614
- Do it.
- No.

35:10.817 --> 35:11.943
I'm not gonna kill you.

35:14.237 --> 35:16.615
But I am gonna watch you face justice.

35:28.918 --> 35:31.717
<i>Well, that's</i> a <i>lot
of satisfied-looking faces.</i>

35:32.005 --> 35:35.100
And Adrian Chase is warming up a cell
at A.R.G.U.S. as we speak.

35:35.258 --> 35:36.259
Did you want to deliver that news?

35:36.426 --> 35:37.427
- 'Cause I don't...
- That's fine.

35:37.594 --> 35:39.096
Okay, so Oliver dropped
this truth bomb on him,

35:39.262 --> 35:42.061
and then he was just like a marionette
with his strings cut off, so epic.

35:42.223 --> 35:44.692
Great. But there are a lot of bad guys
left on the streets, okay?

35:44.851 --> 35:46.273
Damn, girl, you know how to kill a mood.

35:46.436 --> 35:47.528
Rene's right.

35:48.688 --> 35:50.656
- Oh, say that again.
- You're <i>right</i> for tonight.

35:51.149 --> 35:52.241
We should enjoy the win.

35:52.400 --> 35:55.244
Agreed. So, first round's on me.

35:56.112 --> 35:57.238
Yes-
FELICITY: Woo! Yeah-.

36:01.368 --> 36:02.836
I have something for you.

36:03.286 --> 36:04.287
Hm.

36:04.788 --> 36:07.337
Oh. And here I thought
you could never top the Hozen.

36:07.499 --> 36:09.547
It's a video from Dad.

36:10.960 --> 36:12.928
He made it before he died and...

36:13.963 --> 36:15.931
I should've given this to you sooner.

36:17.384 --> 36:21.514
But I was worried that what he said on it
might feel like a burden for you.

36:23.390 --> 36:25.438
You deserve to make that decision
on your own.

36:26.768 --> 36:29.817
After today, I don't think I wanna see
any more videos with him in it.

36:29.979 --> 36:31.196
That's totally up to you.

36:32.357 --> 36:38.330
But I don't want you to think that you're
destined to be Dad, or Mom, or Merlyn.

36:38.988 --> 36:41.332
You need to live your own life.

36:41.491 --> 36:45.121
And the best way to do that
is to leave the past in the past.

37:24.325 --> 37:28.922
Oliver Queen, I'm afraid you're going to
miss your boat home.

37:30.999 --> 37:32.467
Any word from Mr. Ramirez?

37:32.751 --> 37:34.719
Only that he swore
he would be here, Your Honor.

37:34.878 --> 37:37.472
The only problem is, he's not.

37:38.006 --> 37:40.225
Which is leaving me with very few options.

37:42.635 --> 37:44.933
Please, Your Honor,
just give him a few more minutes.

37:45.221 --> 37:48.942
And deprive the other people who got here
on time their right to a fair hearing?

37:51.019 --> 37:52.271
Due to a failure to appear,

37:52.437 --> 37:56.783
Mr. Ramirez's motion to restore
parental rights is hereby denied.

38:16.211 --> 38:20.432
<i>Hello, Thea. If you're seeing this,
then chances are that I'm...</i>

38:22.008 --> 38:23.260
<i>Gone.</i>

38:23.843 --> 38:28.394
<i>No matter what's happened,
no matter what you've heard,</i>

38:29.307 --> 38:31.560
<i>I wanted you to know how much I love you.</i>

38:33.269 --> 38:36.443
<i>You're my daughter. My special girl.</i>

38:38.566 --> 38:42.241
<i>I've done some things in my life, Thea,
that I'm not proud of.</i>

38:42.987 --> 38:46.582
<i>But I am proud of you. I always have been.</i>

38:48.034 --> 38:52.130
<i>You are gonna grow up to be
a remarkable young woman.</i>

38:52.455 --> 38:57.177
<i>Smart, generous, loving,
just like your mom.</i>

38:58.753 --> 39:02.724
<i>But the day will come
when your mother and I are gone.</i>

39:03.508 --> 39:05.226
<i>And then it'll just be
you and your brother.</i>

39:05.927 --> 39:10.433
<i>And the truth is,
you're stronger than he is.</i>

39:11.808 --> 39:16.564
<i>He is going to need to lean on you more
than you're going to need to lean on him.</i>

39:17.438 --> 39:19.691
<i>Oliver, we know, can get through anything</i>

39:20.608 --> 39:23.327
<i>if he has the love and support
of his sister.</i>

39:29.784 --> 39:31.161
I miss him.

39:31.870 --> 39:33.417
I miss both of them.

39:35.290 --> 39:36.633
Every day-

39:38.418 --> 39:41.092
I don't know how to reconcile this...

39:42.338 --> 39:45.387
This man with the one in the other video.

39:45.967 --> 39:47.184
Maybe you don't have to.

39:48.011 --> 39:50.355
Our parents were complex people, Thea.

39:50.555 --> 39:53.729
They had complicated children.

39:54.642 --> 39:59.819
What we have to do is
we have to leave the past in the past.

40:03.109 --> 40:04.326
Live our own lives.

40:04.652 --> 40:05.824
Live our own lives.

40:07.196 --> 40:09.665
Doesn't mean that we love them any less.

40:11.034 --> 40:15.210
And I have a feeling it's what
they would want for both of us.

40:23.171 --> 40:24.468
<i>Thank you for being here.</i>

40:25.006 --> 40:28.351
I'd like to talk with everyone
about my father.

40:30.511 --> 40:32.184
Our father.

40:35.224 --> 40:38.694
Based on further investigation,
I can now state definitively

40:38.895 --> 40:43.401
that the allegations made
against Robert Queen are true.

40:44.484 --> 40:46.703
<i>My father is not hereto defend himself.</i>

40:47.403 --> 40:51.033
<i>And I cannot find the words
to defend his actions.</i>

40:51.407 --> 40:55.378
What I can tell you
is that nearly ten years ago,

40:55.536 --> 40:59.632
in a moment of immense courage,

41:02.085 --> 41:06.636
Robert Queen chose to sacrifice himself
so that I might live.

41:09.384 --> 41:13.890
So that I had the opportunity to
leave behind a better legacy than he did.

41:15.598 --> 41:18.727
So that I might return
and one day serve this city.

41:21.229 --> 41:23.197
Today, we took a step forward.

41:23.606 --> 41:26.155
With help from the Green Arrow
and his team,

41:26.317 --> 41:30.197
the Throwing Star Killer
is now behind bars,

41:30.363 --> 41:32.161
and our streets are a little safer.

41:33.408 --> 41:34.751
<i>Tomorrow, we'll take another step forward.</i>

41:34.909 --> 41:36.911
<i>And the day after,
we will take another one.</i>

41:37.078 --> 41:42.335
<i>Because it is time, it truly is time
for us to leave the past in the past</i>

41:42.500 --> 41:46.846
<i>so that our children might inherit
the Star City we have always dreamed of.</i>

41:48.256 --> 41:51.806
<i>The way my father dreamt of a better life
for me and my sister.</i>
