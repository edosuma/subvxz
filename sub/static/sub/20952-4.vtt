00:14.381 --> 00:17.251
<i>He fell into the Beast blood.</i>

00:18.318 --> 00:20.053
<i>The Beast punishes every mistake.</i>

00:39.473 --> 00:42.109
A legend from <i>Sasuke</i>, raised in Tokyo.

00:58.025 --> 01:00.594
A great name in Japan.

01:00.661 --> 01:02.829
People really love him, support him...

01:02.896 --> 01:07.000
Yuji is one of the great favorites
of this competition.

01:09.203 --> 01:11.471
He's a shoe salesman.

01:13.574 --> 01:17.377
I'm here hoping to make the most

01:17.444 --> 01:21.615
of my training for <i>Sasuke.</i>

01:21.682 --> 01:23.784
<i>I train every day.</i>

01:24.952 --> 01:27.354
<i>I've dreamed...</i>

01:27.421 --> 01:29.957
<i>...of this moment.</i>

02:22.776 --> 02:24.778
That's a legend for you!

02:53.540 --> 02:55.242
He's on the platform!

03:26.306 --> 03:30.077
It's vital to scout each area,

03:30.143 --> 03:33.180
to make every move count, you could say.

04:23.397 --> 04:25.933
Is this possible?

04:31.638 --> 04:35.142
-That's a real <i>Sasuke </i>legend!
-<i>Sasuke </i>legend!

05:24.624 --> 05:28.962
It's times like these
that I'm proud to be Japanese.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.831
An excellent show!

07:07.361 --> 07:10.764
<i>My sister was always like a mother to me.</i>

07:10.831 --> 07:13.700
She was diagnosed with cancer in 2010,

07:13.767 --> 07:16.537
<i>and passed away this year.</i>

07:17.171 --> 07:21.675
<i>I came here representing my sister,</i>
<i>and I will fight to the end to win.</i>

07:21.742 --> 07:25.712
<i>When I return to Brazil,</i>
<i>I'll be the </i>Ultimate Beastmaster <i>champion.</i>

07:32.352 --> 07:35.488
Cool. We are cheering for you, brother.

07:35.556 --> 07:38.158
Let's go, Marcel!

07:48.368 --> 07:49.636
Let's go, Marcel!

08:02.015 --> 08:05.452
He's one
of the taller Brazilian participants.

08:05.518 --> 08:08.321
And he has a chance to get through
this damn course.

08:19.299 --> 08:23.670
My practice is inspired by her.
She had great discipline.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.872
She lived in fear,
but she passed in peace.

09:53.460 --> 09:56.263
Don't watch. Hide behind me.

09:56.330 --> 09:58.265
He's almost there.

10:28.128 --> 10:31.732
<i>I'm a pop idol and personality.</i>

10:31.798 --> 10:36.203
I have these feathers because
feathers spread out like this, right?

10:36.270 --> 10:38.205
I'm prepared to fly to the top

10:38.272 --> 10:40.507
and become Beastmaster.

11:29.989 --> 11:33.626
To make a straight jump...
it's what I couldn't do.

11:47.908 --> 11:50.978
It's harder than it looks.
Look at my hands.

12:13.700 --> 12:15.235
I have two different jobs.

12:15.301 --> 12:19.872
<i>In one, I have a lot of freedom</i>
<i>to express myself.</i>

12:19.940 --> 12:21.341
In the other...

12:21.408 --> 12:23.710
<i>...people tell me what to do.</i>

12:23.776 --> 12:28.481
<i>I am a soldier</i>
<i>with the German Armed Forces</i>

12:28.548 --> 12:31.217
<i>and a dancer.</i>

12:31.284 --> 12:34.287
<i>This combination gives me</i>
<i>the power to win this.</i>

13:32.713 --> 13:36.049
And now Phillip Meyer
goes for the bonus points!

14:00.207 --> 14:01.808
My plan worked out.

14:01.875 --> 14:05.345
I wanted the 10 extra points
of the booster.

14:05.412 --> 14:07.814
The wall would have been too hard.

14:07.881 --> 14:09.416
I reached my goal.

14:09.483 --> 14:10.484
Wow!

14:22.963 --> 14:24.698
<i>When I was 17,</i>

14:24.765 --> 14:27.401
<i>I moved to Berlin with friends</i>
<i>for all the opportunities there.</i>

14:27.467 --> 14:31.604
We didn't have much money.
These experiences shaped me.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.507
<i>They will be useful here at </i>Beastmaster<i>.</i>

15:04.938 --> 15:07.074
-Grab that rope, good!
-Bear, don't let it go!

15:07.140 --> 15:09.309
-He did really well.
-Come on!

15:27.728 --> 15:29.596
My training is perfect for this course.

15:29.662 --> 15:33.633
<i>From rock climbing, to calisthenics,</i>
<i>to gymnastics, to jujitsu...</i>

15:33.699 --> 15:35.468
This versatility in my training

15:35.535 --> 15:37.403
<i>has prepared me for any challenge.</i>

15:49.449 --> 15:52.052
-No!
-No, man!

16:23.750 --> 16:27.020
It's not going to be that hard

16:27.087 --> 16:28.522
once I get the hang of it.

16:28.589 --> 16:30.591
Taeho Kwon is standing by.

16:30.657 --> 16:31.758
He's so handsome!

16:31.824 --> 16:34.360
-Way to go, Taeho!
-Yeah!

16:45.806 --> 16:49.376
<i>Excuses set my limit. That's what I think.</i>

16:49.443 --> 16:51.812
Beastmaster must have it all.

16:51.879 --> 16:55.516
<i>I have my pride.</i>

16:55.582 --> 16:58.619
I should be able to do this.

17:47.667 --> 17:50.069
Incredible! Just incredible!

19:07.748 --> 19:12.085
Strength wasn't the problem.

19:12.152 --> 19:13.820
I just couldn't figure out how.

19:36.809 --> 19:39.412
It's a Brazilian. We are nervous.
We have to scream!

19:39.479 --> 19:41.915
-Go, Edu!
-Go, Brazil!

20:10.110 --> 20:16.016
The first episode where both Americans
are eliminated in the first phase.

20:16.083 --> 20:18.785
Take that, USA!

21:16.210 --> 21:18.212
I was born and raised
in a slum of Rio de Janeiro,

21:18.278 --> 21:21.448
<i>in a very dangerous neighborhood</i>
<i>with a lot of violence.</i>

21:21.514 --> 21:22.648
I was shot.

21:23.516 --> 21:26.952
It took 11 months of rehabilitation
to recover movement in my arm.

21:27.020 --> 21:30.557
<i>My life continued</i>
<i>and I followed the right path.</i>

21:30.623 --> 21:32.258
Today I am ready for any challenge.

22:06.093 --> 22:07.794
Very good!

22:07.861 --> 22:12.032
He had a problem, but he managed
to overcome it. Very nice, Edu!

23:25.606 --> 23:26.740
Give it all, bro!

23:51.999 --> 23:54.134
Damn it!

24:35.908 --> 24:37.743
I'm the type

24:37.810 --> 24:41.680
that's cool and collected
during a match.

24:41.747 --> 24:44.350
My heart pounds when it's coming up,

24:44.418 --> 24:49.256
but I'm cool once it starts.

25:37.436 --> 25:40.305
-Oh, no way!
-Oh, no! What happened?

25:40.372 --> 25:43.809
It's all over for Yuji Urushihara!

25:57.257 --> 26:00.327
You might say I got in over my head.

26:00.394 --> 26:03.363
I was confident I could pull it off,

26:03.430 --> 26:05.265
and that backfired.

26:06.099 --> 26:08.602
It didn't work. I'm sorry.

28:09.154 --> 28:13.392
-He reached the Point Thruster!
-He did it!

28:13.458 --> 28:16.261
-You're too happy for Germany.
-It's okay. He reached the Point Thruster!

28:30.242 --> 28:32.778
This soldier knows where to go.

28:32.844 --> 28:35.380
He wants to dance.

28:35.447 --> 28:38.183
-Why not? Why not?
-You can see he is having fun.

28:51.231 --> 28:53.800
-Now a long jump.
-Yes!

28:53.867 --> 28:56.403
Now this soldier gets going.

29:05.846 --> 29:07.447
Phillip Meyer!

29:50.224 --> 29:53.760
-And he falls!
-He falls!

30:09.543 --> 30:13.146
The beret brought me luck.
Thanks, comrades.

30:13.213 --> 30:16.049
I will try to win!

30:23.624 --> 30:26.927
For my family, my pride.
That's why I'm here.

30:26.994 --> 30:28.962
I'll do it for you. You're my engine.

30:29.029 --> 30:30.030
Right? Come on.

30:44.678 --> 30:46.780
I'm so sorry, Jalil!

30:46.847 --> 30:49.883
Our dear Mexican gave his all.

31:01.228 --> 31:05.332
She passed away
during the selection process.

31:05.399 --> 31:08.068
<i>My sister always believed in me,</i>

31:08.135 --> 31:10.938
so it's only fair that I can
give this gift to her.

32:26.545 --> 32:28.713
It's not possible!

32:48.268 --> 32:51.805
All kinds of athletes are here
from all around the world.

32:51.872 --> 32:56.076
<i>It's an honor to go through all this.</i>

32:56.143 --> 32:59.479
<i>All the Korean people are shouting for me,</i>

32:59.544 --> 33:02.747
and I will do my best to please them.

34:01.742 --> 34:04.077
He wants to hear it!

34:04.144 --> 34:05.913
You are the best!

34:29.167 --> 34:32.771
He's climbing! He's got it!

35:01.168 --> 35:02.302
Kwon Taeho!

35:04.071 --> 35:05.539
Kwon Taeho!

36:11.305 --> 36:14.041
Kwon Taeho! Kwon Taeho!

36:14.107 --> 36:15.576
That was so hard!

36:25.686 --> 36:29.990
It's so great. I'm so proud to be Korean.

36:30.057 --> 36:32.659
Korea is the strongest.

36:32.726 --> 36:34.461
Go, Korea!

37:24.811 --> 37:27.881
Jonas!

37:27.946 --> 37:29.047
Yeah!

37:46.700 --> 37:49.503
Jonas Kegelmann on his way
to the next obstacle.

37:49.570 --> 37:50.904
Go, Jonas, go!

38:59.540 --> 39:01.041
No, Jonas!

39:14.555 --> 39:16.223
Brazil!

39:16.290 --> 39:20.194
They are making fun of us
because Jonas is out.

39:20.260 --> 39:22.095
What are you going to say?

40:38.539 --> 40:41.408
I might have this, if my timing's not off.

40:41.475 --> 40:43.310
In any case, I'm nervous.

40:45.345 --> 40:46.780
This is a tough one.

40:46.847 --> 40:50.117
We need to take the Korean out.
He is very confident.

40:50.715 --> 40:52.517
Go home, Korea.

40:52.586 --> 40:55.956
All kinds of athletes are here
from all over the world.

40:56.023 --> 40:58.392
I want to show them that a Korean

40:58.458 --> 41:02.696
can be the best among them.

41:02.763 --> 41:04.665
Today is me and Marcel, for sure.

41:04.731 --> 41:06.300
Brazil!

41:20.878 --> 41:23.181
In Level 2, I was already
wearing my beret.

41:23.247 --> 41:27.251
Now in Level 3, I am wearing it again...

41:28.121 --> 41:31.124
...for my comrades.

41:36.830 --> 41:38.165
Here we go, Phillip!

41:38.232 --> 41:39.867
Phillip, come on!

42:26.513 --> 42:28.448
Come on. Come on!

42:45.199 --> 42:47.601
It was too shaky.

42:47.665 --> 42:50.768
In the beginning, it was too fast.

43:14.461 --> 43:16.930
What the hell?

43:16.997 --> 43:19.967
Grab it! Hold it,

43:20.033 --> 43:21.535
for the love of God!

43:39.720 --> 43:42.055
If my hand was... maybe...

43:42.122 --> 43:46.026
But when I went to grab it,
I could not close my fingers.

43:46.093 --> 43:47.361
So...

44:37.277 --> 44:40.180
-It's harder than it looks.
-Way harder.

45:15.115 --> 45:17.584
Okay, kid. I'm so sorry.

46:16.410 --> 46:18.812
Brazil!

46:19.079 --> 46:20.981
Germany!

46:31.058 --> 46:33.760
He danced, looked around,

46:33.827 --> 46:36.430
wiggled, jumped. Edu is out.

46:48.876 --> 46:52.012
We know that the winner is the one
that makes the least mistakes.

46:52.079 --> 46:54.248
I messed up in the beginning.
Unfortunately.

48:02.015 --> 48:04.618
Please make us proud.

48:04.685 --> 48:06.053
Yes, do your best!

48:16.460 --> 48:18.462
Oh, no! What happened?

48:20.064 --> 48:22.867
The <i>Sasuke </i>legend is eliminated!

48:23.267 --> 48:25.302
-Yuji!
-What the hell, Yuji?

48:25.372 --> 48:27.708
-Yuji!
-What the hell, Yuji?

48:51.765 --> 48:55.602
I'm terribly sorry to everyone
who cheered me on.

48:55.669 --> 48:58.338
If there's ever the chance,

48:58.405 --> 49:01.041
I'd like to participate again.
It was a mediocre finish,

49:01.108 --> 49:02.743
and I'm terribly sorry.

49:32.606 --> 49:35.843
I want to show them that I can do it.

49:35.909 --> 49:38.745
That a dance instructor and soldier

49:38.876 --> 49:41.278
can compete against the best athletes
in the world.

49:41.979 --> 49:45.916
I'm going to make it no matter what.

49:45.983 --> 49:48.519
I want to show everyone
what Koreans can do.

49:55.162 --> 49:58.031
-Go, Korea!
-C'mon, Phillip!

50:42.342 --> 50:45.712
-That's it! That's it!
-He's going to touch it!

50:49.583 --> 50:53.887
<i>Phillip, he has got 20 points!</i>

51:35.829 --> 51:37.497
-Phillip Meyer!
-Phillip!

52:32.052 --> 52:34.254
<i>Six, five, four...</i>

52:34.321 --> 52:36.456
three, two, one.

52:38.292 --> 52:40.327
Phillip Meyer!

52:42.826 --> 52:46.263
He won $10,000!

53:02.416 --> 53:06.687
I cannot describe this feeling.
Incredible.

53:06.753 --> 53:10.190
<i>I am Beastmaster and look forward</i>
<i>to the chance</i>

53:10.257 --> 53:14.127
to become the Ultimate Beastmaster.
