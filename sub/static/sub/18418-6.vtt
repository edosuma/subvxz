00:00.000 --> 00:01.540
Previously on Nashville

00:01.540 --> 00:04.170
I had the pleasure of getting to
know your daughter, Maddie.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.500
I have been a terrible
person in my life.

00:07.500 --> 00:11.000
I think someone wanted you to
have a chance to change.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.170
I don't do the things
you're asking me to do.

00:13.170 --> 00:14.920
I don't move the way
you're asking me to move.

00:14.920 --> 00:17.920
You fight me and you
waste everyone's time!

00:19.670 --> 00:20.830
What's all this?

00:20.830 --> 00:22.000
This didn't even come
through the mail.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.420
It didn't have a stamp
on it or anything.

00:23.420 --> 00:25.750
Rayna, I'm so glad I found you.
Have you got my letters?

00:25.750 --> 00:27.750
Wait, I just want
to talk to you!

00:27.750 --> 00:28.750
-Outside!

00:30.580 --> 00:31.960
The important thing

00:31.960 --> 00:34.000
is most of these guys
end up not being dangerous.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.170
- Yeah, well, he tried
to attack her, so...

00:37.170 --> 00:38.210
- Well, he tried
to get to her.

00:38.210 --> 00:39.460
Now the question is
in his mind,

00:39.460 --> 00:41.500
was that to attack her
or to be her friend?

00:41.500 --> 00:42.830
- I wouldn't bet
on the second one.

00:42.830 --> 00:44.250
- We're not. Don't worry.

00:44.250 --> 00:46.330
- Oh, hey, babe.
- Hey.

00:46.330 --> 00:48.250
- This is Dave Winters.

00:48.250 --> 00:50.500
He's the security guy
that Dolly told us about.

00:50.500 --> 00:52.420
- Oh, yeah. Thanks so much
for coming over so quick.

00:52.420 --> 00:53.580
- Nice to meet you.
- Appreciate it.

00:53.580 --> 00:54.920
I was just saying
to Mr. Claybourne

00:54.920 --> 00:56.880
that most of these people
are actually harmless.

00:56.880 --> 00:59.330
If we handle them right
and we have some patience,

00:59.330 --> 01:00.830
we can get him to go away.

01:00.830 --> 01:02.420
Now the problem is the few
who have something else in mind.

01:02.420 --> 01:04.620
That's where
you really need us.

01:04.620 --> 01:06.330
- I have friends
who've gone through this,

01:06.330 --> 01:07.540
and it can last for years.

01:07.540 --> 01:08.920
- I know.
It's like a virus.

01:08.920 --> 01:10.120
But the main thing is

01:10.120 --> 01:11.830
you've got the restraining order
in place now.

01:11.830 --> 01:13.170
- Well, that's just
a piece of paper, though.

01:13.170 --> 01:14.540
- That's true, but if
he violates the terms,

01:14.540 --> 01:15.710
he's going to jail.

01:15.710 --> 01:17.250
- And violating the terms
means what,

01:17.250 --> 01:18.750
that he tries
to come after me again?

01:18.750 --> 01:21.420
- Ms. Jaymes,
every one of us

01:21.420 --> 01:23.250
has been to Iraq,
Afghanistan,

01:23.250 --> 01:25.420
and places
you never heard of

01:25.420 --> 01:28.330
dealing with nasty,
nasty characters.

01:28.330 --> 01:30.880
This man
will not get to you.

01:33.830 --> 01:35.250
- Oh, look
at that beautiful leg.

01:35.250 --> 01:37.880
- Looks like craters
on the moon under that bandage.

01:37.880 --> 01:39.750
- Well, better than
steel rods sticking out.

01:39.750 --> 01:41.580
- I still can't move
my left leg.

01:41.580 --> 01:42.620
- God, you will. Jeez.

01:42.620 --> 01:44.830
- I'm not a patient person.

01:44.830 --> 01:46.380
- Really? I hadn't noticed.

01:46.380 --> 01:47.960
Okay, stay put.

01:47.960 --> 01:49.830
We'll work on
your range of motion.

01:54.210 --> 01:56.330
- So have you told
your dad yet?

01:56.330 --> 01:57.960
- God, you're nosy.

01:57.960 --> 02:00.000
- Yeah, and proud of it.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.750
- Yeah. I actually called him
on Sunday finally.

02:02.750 --> 02:07.540
His exact words were,
"God doesn't make mistakes."

02:07.540 --> 02:10.380
- No.
- It's okay. I told him,

02:10.380 --> 02:12.000
well, God must have known
what he was doing

02:12.000 --> 02:13.420
when he made me trans.

02:13.420 --> 02:14.960
- Yes. You go, girl.

02:14.960 --> 02:17.330
- Okay, ease into it.

02:17.330 --> 02:18.710
Good.
- It's so weird.

02:18.710 --> 02:21.170
Sometimes I think
I'd be better off as a guy.

02:21.170 --> 02:22.790
- (laughs)

02:22.790 --> 02:24.330
I swear!
- Now that's funny.

02:24.330 --> 02:25.920
- I swear.
I think like a guy.

02:25.920 --> 02:26.960
That's the truth.

02:26.960 --> 02:29.040
- All right, Mr. Macho.

02:29.040 --> 02:30.620
Ready for that left leg?

02:30.620 --> 02:33.790
- Oh, yeah.
(both laugh)

02:33.790 --> 02:35.540
- Whoa!

02:35.540 --> 02:38.500
"Home." Your first gold.

02:38.500 --> 02:40.670
- I was such a baby
when I did that.

02:40.670 --> 02:43.830
- Excuse me. "Billboard"
number one for six weeks.

02:43.830 --> 02:44.880
- Good.

02:44.880 --> 02:46.000
- Yeah, some people
like video games.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.170
I like finding out

02:47.170 --> 02:50.000
everything there is to know
about a subject.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.790
And guess what I found out.
- What?

02:51.790 --> 02:54.960
- Luke Wheeler is selling
Wheelin' Dealin'.

02:54.960 --> 02:56.330
- No, he's not.
- Yeah. He still wants to sing.

02:56.330 --> 02:57.500
He's just tired
of the business.

02:57.500 --> 02:58.580
- Who told you that?

02:58.580 --> 03:00.000
- I told you
I like to know things.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.580
- There's no way that's true.
I would know.

03:01.580 --> 03:03.120
This is a very small town.

03:03.120 --> 03:04.330
- Rayna, we should buy it.

03:04.330 --> 03:06.170
- What?
- Highway 65

03:06.170 --> 03:09.120
should buy Wheelin' Dealin'
without delay.

03:09.120 --> 03:10.500
- With what, your money?

03:10.500 --> 03:11.830
- Of course.

03:11.830 --> 03:13.750
Rayna, I really think
you need to do this.

03:13.750 --> 03:16.170
This is the next step
in making Highway 65

03:16.170 --> 03:17.790
what you want it to be.

03:17.790 --> 03:19.170
- Luke Wheeler is not gonna
sell me Wheelin' Dealin'.

03:19.170 --> 03:21.170
You realize that we were
supposed to get married.

03:21.170 --> 03:22.670
I left him at the altar.

03:22.670 --> 03:25.210
- Right. You think
I don't know that?

03:25.210 --> 03:27.000
- Of course you do.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.460
- Come on.

03:29.960 --> 03:33.250
- Apparently, Hockney
had been stalking Jaymes

03:33.250 --> 03:34.920
for months
without her knowledge.

03:34.920 --> 03:36.380
According to
the restraining order,

03:36.380 --> 03:37.460
Hockney must stay
more than 300 feet...

03:37.460 --> 03:41.540
- Can you turn that off,
please?

03:41.540 --> 03:44.250
- So is he just
coming after you

03:44.250 --> 03:46.880
or is it me and Dad
and Daph, too?

03:46.880 --> 03:48.620
- Nobody's coming after
anybody.

03:48.620 --> 03:49.880
He's trying to, you know,

03:49.880 --> 03:51.920
he's just trying
to get close to me

03:51.920 --> 03:53.670
in a way
that's inappropriate.

03:53.670 --> 03:54.790
- We're just gonna make sure
he doesn't.

03:54.790 --> 03:56.000
- Are you gonna carry a gun?

03:56.000 --> 03:57.920
- Yeah.
- No.

03:57.920 --> 04:00.880
- Look, baby, he hasn't made
any threats or anything, right?

04:00.880 --> 04:02.080
He's a stalker.

04:02.080 --> 04:04.670
It's just an unfortunate
part of this business.

04:04.670 --> 04:06.750
- Okay. Well,
I don't want any dessert,

04:06.750 --> 04:08.790
so I'm gonna go
to my room now.

04:08.790 --> 04:11.120
- She wants to call Clay
and have dessert later.

04:11.120 --> 04:14.040
- Hey, honey, can we all
stay here for a second

04:14.040 --> 04:15.290
and talk about this?

04:15.290 --> 04:16.830
This really
affects everybody.

04:16.830 --> 04:18.710
- I thought you just said
that there was no threat.

04:18.710 --> 04:20.500
- Well, I just want to make sure
we're on the same page.

04:20.500 --> 04:23.540
- Just say it, okay?
You hate him.

04:23.540 --> 04:26.670
- I hate who? Clay?

04:26.670 --> 04:28.000
- Yes. It's so obvious.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.710
- All right, we're talking
about security here.

04:29.710 --> 04:31.830
- I don't hate Clay.
I don't even know Clay.

04:31.830 --> 04:33.250
I think
he's too old for you.

04:33.250 --> 04:34.540
What is he, 27?

04:34.540 --> 04:36.670
- He's 24, and you guys
clearly hate him

04:36.670 --> 04:37.880
because he's black.

04:37.880 --> 04:39.670
- Hey!
- Are you kidding me right now?

04:39.670 --> 04:41.330
- You guys can't
seriously tell me

04:41.330 --> 04:42.500
that you had no reaction.

04:43.620 --> 04:45.830
- I'll let you.

04:45.830 --> 04:47.120
- My reaction?

04:47.120 --> 04:49.670
I don't want my daughter
being taken advantage of.

04:49.670 --> 04:51.790
And a 24-year-old
with a 17-year-old

04:51.790 --> 04:53.210
is taking advantage.
- Oh, God.

04:53.210 --> 04:56.460
- I don't care if he's
green, blue or purple.

04:56.460 --> 04:58.380
Does he know
he can go to jail for this?

04:58.380 --> 04:59.710
- Just forget it, okay?
- No, no, no, no.

04:59.710 --> 05:01.710
We are gonna have this out
right here right now.

05:01.710 --> 05:03.380
You think my reaction would
be different if he was white?

05:03.380 --> 05:05.290
- Yes. Honestly, I do.

05:05.290 --> 05:08.670
- Here's what I really think.

05:08.670 --> 05:11.670
Not very long ago,
white people and black people

05:11.670 --> 05:14.380
had a very hard time trying to
be in a relationship together,

05:14.380 --> 05:15.670
even when we were younger.

05:15.670 --> 05:17.380
We knew people like that,
and it was not easy.

05:17.380 --> 05:18.960
Just like for gay people,
it wasn't easy.

05:18.960 --> 05:21.460
But, my God,
the world has changed.

05:21.460 --> 05:22.750
People can make choices

05:22.750 --> 05:23.830
that they didn't use
to be able to make,

05:23.830 --> 05:26.000
and that is
an amazing thing.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.210
So if he was your age,
I would say, yes, you go, girl.

05:29.210 --> 05:30.500
You love whoever
you want to love.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.000
That is great with me.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.830
- Thank you.

05:33.830 --> 05:35.120
- But he's not your age,
he's 24,

05:35.120 --> 05:36.420
and he's too old for you.

05:36.420 --> 05:39.540
- I'm going upstairs now,
okay?

05:44.170 --> 05:47.460
- He's really cute.

05:49.170 --> 05:51.040
Just saying.

06:06.170 --> 06:09.330
- Hey.
- Look at you on crutches!

06:09.330 --> 06:10.830
- I've only fallen
four times today.

06:10.830 --> 06:12.080
Come in.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.500
I'm glad
we're finally doing this.

06:13.500 --> 06:15.170
- Yeah.

06:16.330 --> 06:18.500
No, my folks
are still in North Carolina.

06:18.500 --> 06:21.540
I came here for college
and I never left.

06:21.540 --> 06:22.790
- You're a social worker?

06:22.790 --> 06:25.580
- Yeah. I work
with families in crisis.

06:25.580 --> 06:26.790
- That's amazing.

06:26.790 --> 06:28.920
- Sometimes. You know,
a lot of the time,

06:28.920 --> 06:31.330
it's just heartbreaking.

06:31.330 --> 06:32.500
- Yeah, I bet.

06:32.500 --> 06:35.040
You make a huge difference
in peoples' lives.

06:36.250 --> 06:39.080
So you really think that
this is gonna be okay?

06:39.080 --> 06:41.210
- Mm-hmm. It's a church,
you know.

06:41.210 --> 06:43.040
Anybody can come.
- I know.

06:43.040 --> 06:44.830
I just don't
want to be a distraction.

06:44.830 --> 06:47.330
- Juliette can sometimes
have that effect.

06:47.330 --> 06:48.540
- I haven't been
in public since--

06:48.540 --> 06:49.880
- You know what?

06:49.880 --> 06:52.040
I think people are gonna be
really happy to see you.

06:52.040 --> 06:54.170
Avery, you should come, too.

06:54.170 --> 06:56.170
- You know, I'd love to,
but I have a gig on Sunday.

06:56.170 --> 06:58.000
- He's performing
at Barista Parlor.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.620
First time in a while.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.460
- Congratulations.

07:01.460 --> 07:02.670
- Thank you.

07:02.670 --> 07:06.830
- All right.
I have to ask this.

07:06.830 --> 07:09.830
Girl, you can sing?

07:09.830 --> 07:11.830
- (chuckles)
Thank you.

07:11.830 --> 07:14.330
Wait. Was that a question?

07:14.330 --> 07:16.500
- You know what
my question's gonna be.

07:16.500 --> 07:17.750
- Have I ever pursued it?

07:17.750 --> 07:19.000
- Yes. Have you?

07:19.000 --> 07:21.290
- I am pursuing it
in my way.

07:21.290 --> 07:25.330
I just don't know if it
would mean anything to you.

07:25.330 --> 07:29.500
- Why not? 'Cause it's not
about fame and fortune?

07:29.500 --> 07:30.960
What's it mean to you?

07:30.960 --> 07:32.540
- You know,
why don't you come

07:32.540 --> 07:36.500
to the East Nashville
Community Center Monday 2:00?

07:36.500 --> 07:38.330
I'll show you.

07:38.330 --> 07:39.960
- Okay.

07:41.830 --> 07:43.170
- Don't look
down the hallway.

07:43.170 --> 07:45.170
Just stare in your locker.

07:45.170 --> 07:46.500
- Why?

07:46.500 --> 07:49.330
- Flynn-Bur-Nett.

07:49.330 --> 07:51.670
- What about him?
- Wants to text you.

07:51.670 --> 07:53.210
- Get out!
- Swear.

07:53.210 --> 07:55.620
Jeanie told Amelia
and she told my brother.

07:55.620 --> 07:57.000
- Why?

07:57.000 --> 07:58.290
- Don't ask that question.

07:58.290 --> 08:00.080
I told Jeanie
I'd give him your cell,

08:00.080 --> 08:02.290
but you have to say
that's okay.

08:03.880 --> 08:05.670
- Oh, my God,
he looked at me.

08:05.670 --> 08:07.330
- I take it
that's a yes.

08:07.330 --> 08:08.880
- Motion and sound
activated.

08:08.880 --> 08:10.210
And once again,
if you see our friend,

08:10.210 --> 08:13.500
go ahead and hit
the emergency key on the keypad.

08:13.500 --> 08:14.670
(alarm sounds)

08:14.670 --> 08:15.960
- Thank you.

08:15.960 --> 08:16.960
(alarm stops)

08:16.960 --> 08:18.420
Thank you.

08:18.420 --> 08:20.170
- Oh...

08:20.170 --> 08:23.920
- They're almost done.
They're heading out.

08:23.920 --> 08:26.830
- I'm worried about Maddie.

08:26.830 --> 08:28.120
- Yeah, me, too.

08:28.120 --> 08:30.460
Wanna put a guard on her?

08:30.460 --> 08:31.580
(both laugh)

08:31.580 --> 08:32.960
- I don't know.

08:32.960 --> 08:36.040
I feel like we're all
so vulnerable right now.

08:36.040 --> 08:38.040
And she's a child,
but she's not a child.

08:38.040 --> 08:40.040
And everything I say
is wrong and--

08:40.040 --> 08:42.540
- She's just a teenager
lashing out at her mom.

08:42.540 --> 08:43.620
You know that.

08:43.620 --> 08:44.920
- I don't know.

08:44.920 --> 08:48.500
By the time I was a teenager,
my mom was gone.

08:48.500 --> 08:51.620
Can't fight about boys
with a ghost.

08:51.620 --> 08:54.460
- Baby...

08:56.170 --> 08:57.750
She needs you
so damn much.

08:57.750 --> 09:00.040
That's what makes her mad.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.000
- You're kind of smart.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.290
- (chuckles)

09:06.040 --> 09:07.920
- Oh, over here.

09:07.920 --> 09:09.880
Okay, this old guy
is totally crazy,

09:09.880 --> 09:11.170
but he knows everything.

09:11.170 --> 09:13.170
(knock knock)
Jimmy?

09:14.460 --> 09:15.750
- Here we go.

09:15.750 --> 09:17.210
Look out for this guy.

09:17.210 --> 09:18.540
He steals
all my best records.

09:18.540 --> 09:21.210
- Oh, hey, hey, hey.
I buy your best records.

09:21.210 --> 09:22.790
- The price you pay,
it's stealing.

09:22.790 --> 09:27.120
Oh, look what I found in
somebody's barn this week.

09:29.830 --> 09:32.000
- Oh, my God!

09:32.000 --> 09:35.670
Bob Wills
"Smoke on the Water," 1945.

09:35.670 --> 09:37.920
Kill me!
- Perfect condition, too.

09:37.920 --> 09:40.290
But this is not for you.

09:40.290 --> 09:41.580
I could get 200
for this easy.

09:41.580 --> 09:42.750
- Oh, come on, Jimmy.

09:42.750 --> 09:43.920
You know I'd give it
a good home.

09:43.920 --> 09:46.120
- Oh, make me cry.

09:46.120 --> 09:48.620
50.

09:48.620 --> 09:50.170
- Oh! You're killing me!

09:50.170 --> 09:53.000
- Look, I'm trying
to retire here, okay?

09:54.210 --> 09:56.500
10 bucks?
Can you handle that?

09:56.500 --> 09:58.040
- (laughs)
- Sold.

09:58.040 --> 09:59.040
- What are you
laughing about?

09:59.040 --> 10:01.000
This is not funny.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.750
- All right,
so I'm kind of confused.

10:04.750 --> 10:06.000
- About what?

10:06.000 --> 10:08.210
- Well, you say that
you have mood swings,

10:08.210 --> 10:11.920
but other than that one night,
I really haven't seen them.

10:11.920 --> 10:13.960
Everybody just seems
to love you.

10:13.960 --> 10:16.330
- So what, like because
I put on a good show,

10:16.330 --> 10:18.830
everything must be all right
on the inside?

10:18.830 --> 10:21.120
- Is this really
just a show?

10:21.120 --> 10:23.620
- Look, do we really have
to talk about this right now?

10:23.620 --> 10:24.750
I mean, come on.

10:24.750 --> 10:25.830
I thought we were having
a good time.

10:25.830 --> 10:27.080
- Well,
I don't want to think

10:27.080 --> 10:28.170
that you're putting on
a show for me.

10:28.170 --> 10:30.000
- Look, everybody's
putting a show.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.250
You're putting on a show
right now.

10:31.250 --> 10:32.750
- No, I'm not.

10:32.750 --> 10:34.170
- Okay, you're really young.

10:34.170 --> 10:36.080
Look, maybe this
was a mistake.

10:36.080 --> 10:37.920
- How am I
putting on a show?

10:37.920 --> 10:40.170
- Because there are things
on your mind right now

10:40.170 --> 10:41.500
that you're
not talking about.

10:41.500 --> 10:42.580
You're mad at somebody.

10:42.580 --> 10:43.920
You're worried
about something.

10:43.920 --> 10:45.710
Everybody has things
they don't talk about.

10:45.710 --> 10:48.670
- Okay. What are you
not talking about?

10:48.670 --> 10:51.290
- Why are you doing this?
- 'Cause I want to know.

10:51.290 --> 10:53.710
- Okay, you want to know
what I'm not talking about?

10:53.710 --> 10:55.290
I think you're scared of me.

10:55.290 --> 10:57.000
- I am a little.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.080
- At least you're honest.

10:59.080 --> 11:00.880
- Do you want to know
what I'm not talking about?

11:00.880 --> 11:02.170
- No.
- Too bad.

11:02.170 --> 11:03.540
When you got hurt,
who started the fight?

11:03.540 --> 11:05.880
- Oh, my God. Is that
what you're scared of?

11:05.880 --> 11:07.710
What, you think I'm gonna
hit you or something?

11:07.710 --> 11:09.750
- You're an idiot.

11:09.750 --> 11:12.420
I'm asking you
who started the fight.

11:12.420 --> 11:15.000
- Look, I don't hurt people,
Maddie.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.380
The only person I hurt
is myself.

11:19.540 --> 11:21.710
- That's what I'm afraid of.

11:32.040 --> 11:34.000
- You sure about this?

11:34.000 --> 11:35.830
- No.

11:35.830 --> 11:38.040

- Hey, Billy.

14:36.710 --> 14:39.080
Didn't think I'd see you
at Barista Parlor.

14:39.080 --> 14:40.880
- That's what I love
about Nashville.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.790
You never know where you're
gonna find new talent.

14:42.790 --> 14:45.330
- Find any today?

14:45.330 --> 14:47.670
- I almost forgot
you could sing.

14:47.670 --> 14:49.460
- I've been busy.

14:49.460 --> 14:51.790
- Yeah, I'm really sorry
to hear about Juliette.

14:51.790 --> 14:54.420
I'll tell you what, though.

14:54.420 --> 14:57.040
You decide you're ready
for a real manager,

14:57.040 --> 15:00.040
give me a call.

15:00.040 --> 15:01.620
- Thanks, Billy.

15:01.620 --> 15:03.580
- You got it.

15:03.580 --> 15:06.710
My first commission.

15:11.920 --> 15:14.580
- You look good today.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.880
- It's nice to finally
be able to get around.

15:16.880 --> 15:19.000
- I can only imagine.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.080
- Yeah, learning patience
was quite a trial.

15:22.080 --> 15:23.620
- I'm gonna go out on a limb

15:23.620 --> 15:26.540
and say it was your feistiness
that got you through this.

15:26.540 --> 15:29.250
- I'm gonna take that
as a compliment.

15:29.250 --> 15:32.790
- You should.
So I wanted to talk to you,

15:32.790 --> 15:34.460
because Luke Wheeler

15:34.460 --> 15:36.040
is selling
Wheelin' Dealin' Records,

15:36.040 --> 15:39.040
and Highway 65
is going after it.

15:39.040 --> 15:40.210
- Wow.

15:40.210 --> 15:42.210
- So I wanted to see
how you would feel

15:42.210 --> 15:44.920
about coming back
to Highway 65.

15:44.920 --> 15:48.250
- I'm flattered...

15:48.250 --> 15:52.040
and surprised, considering
everything that happened.

15:52.040 --> 15:54.210
- There's a lot of water
under that bridge.

15:54.210 --> 15:59.000
- I'm not sure
what use I'd be to you.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.790
- What are you
talking about?

16:00.790 --> 16:03.500
You're gonna be back in
the studio before you know it.

16:03.500 --> 16:06.170
- I actually
do have an idea.

16:06.170 --> 16:08.380
- See? I knew it.

16:08.380 --> 16:11.210
- I want to make
a gospel album.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.040
Gospel and spiritual.

16:14.040 --> 16:15.420
- Wow.

16:15.420 --> 16:17.080
- And you think
that's a terrible idea.

16:17.080 --> 16:19.710
- I don't.
It's just a big change.

16:19.710 --> 16:21.330
- Well, it's where I'm at
in my life.

16:21.330 --> 16:24.710
- Yeah.
That's gonna be beautiful.

16:24.710 --> 16:27.540
- And you're regretting
asking me to join Highway 65.

16:27.540 --> 16:30.670
- No. I'm thinking to myself,
whatever you do next,

16:30.670 --> 16:33.040
I want it to be on my label.

16:35.920 --> 16:37.170

16:37.170 --> 16:39.120

16:42.210 --> 16:44.710

What timing.

16:44.710 --> 16:48.880

talking about you for hours.

16:48.880 --> 16:50.960
Are you ready to see it?

16:50.960 --> 16:53.210
- No.

17:00.830 --> 17:02.880
- It won't bite you.

17:02.880 --> 17:04.420
- It already did.

17:04.420 --> 17:08.000
- I'm sorry about that.
I say it again.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.710
You don't
have to look at it.

17:09.710 --> 17:12.000
- Yeah, I do. The whole
world's gonna look at it.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.960

18:25.120 --> 18:26.750
- How did you do that?

18:26.750 --> 18:28.420
- What did I do?

18:28.420 --> 18:31.420
- I always hated
seeing pictures of myself.

18:31.420 --> 18:33.540
Kind of made me gag
most of the time.

18:33.540 --> 18:34.460

18:34.460 --> 18:36.710
- No, this is different.

18:36.710 --> 18:38.960
- I'm not sure I understand
what's happening.

18:38.960 --> 18:40.380
- This was a horrible
experience for me,

18:40.380 --> 18:42.790
and I hated you.
You know that.

18:42.790 --> 18:44.250
- It was somewhat obvious.

18:44.250 --> 18:46.380
- So how did you do that?

18:48.500 --> 18:52.880
I'm seeing myself,
but not from the outside.

18:52.880 --> 18:55.250
Not like a picture.

18:57.120 --> 19:01.290
You've shown me
from the inside.

19:03.540 --> 19:07.620
You've shown me what I look like
in my own mind.

19:07.620 --> 19:09.710
How did you do that?

19:09.710 --> 19:11.790
- I didn't.

19:11.790 --> 19:13.290
You did.

19:16.880 --> 19:18.290
- We don't need
to talk about it anymore.

19:18.290 --> 19:20.040
I get it.

19:21.420 --> 19:22.580
I got to go.

19:22.580 --> 19:25.000
- Was that Clay?
You didn't need to hang up.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.250
- I know.

19:26.250 --> 19:29.040
- What's going on?

19:29.040 --> 19:30.170
- Nothing.

19:30.170 --> 19:32.040
- You can talk to me,
you know.

19:32.040 --> 19:36.460
- I know...but I can't.

19:36.460 --> 19:37.250
- Because?

19:37.250 --> 19:38.580
- Because it's nothing.

19:38.580 --> 19:40.880
- Well, it's not nothing.
If it was nothing,

19:40.880 --> 19:42.670
then I think
you'd be talking to me.

19:44.540 --> 19:47.120
- Why do people have to be
so complicated?

19:47.120 --> 19:49.580
- Because they're people.
How's he complicated?

19:49.580 --> 19:52.500
- No. If I tell you,
you'll freak out.

19:52.500 --> 19:55.120
- I won't freak out,
I promise.

19:55.120 --> 20:00.330
- So he says
that he is bipolar.

20:00.330 --> 20:04.040
- Okay.

20:04.040 --> 20:06.000
There's treatment for that.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.460
- No. He won't take
any medicine.

20:07.460 --> 20:11.710
He says it's like
hurting his creativity.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.710
- Well, how does he act?
- Mom.

20:13.710 --> 20:15.420
- I'm just wondering
how it affects his behavior.

20:15.420 --> 20:17.580
- This is exactly why
I can't talk to you about this!

20:17.580 --> 20:19.250
- What do you think
I'm gonna say?

20:19.250 --> 20:20.750
- No. I know
what you're gonna say.

20:20.750 --> 20:22.540
He's bad for you.
He's gonna hurt you.

20:22.540 --> 20:24.330
You should be with somebody
who's not crazy.

20:24.330 --> 20:26.210
- Well, you should be with
someone who's not crazy,

20:26.210 --> 20:27.830
if you can find someone.

20:27.830 --> 20:30.040
(both laugh)

20:31.880 --> 20:33.330
How does he treat you?

20:33.330 --> 20:39.380
- He's amazing,
like so sweet and smart.

20:39.380 --> 20:43.620
But then sometimes he's just
like completely gone.

20:45.290 --> 20:49.540
- Well, my baby,
I would spare you

20:49.540 --> 20:52.460
all the hurt in the world
if I could,

20:52.460 --> 20:54.920
but I can't.

20:57.380 --> 21:00.580
I fell in love with
a messed up alcoholic.

21:00.580 --> 21:04.460
Wasted years of my life
trying to figure that out.

21:04.460 --> 21:06.960
Got it wrong
most of the time.

21:06.960 --> 21:08.750
I mean, we're good now,

21:08.750 --> 21:13.380
but I'm not sitting
in judgment of anybody.

21:18.040 --> 21:21.460
I just hope...

21:21.460 --> 21:22.670
- What?

21:22.670 --> 21:26.750
- I just hope you know
you deserve to be happy.

21:26.750 --> 21:29.290
Everybody does.

21:34.330 --> 21:35.880
- Who here likes candy?

21:35.880 --> 21:37.040
- Me!
- Me!

21:37.040 --> 21:38.210
- I knew it!
We're in luck,

21:38.210 --> 21:39.880
because you know
what our name is?

21:39.880 --> 21:40.960
- No.
- No.

21:40.960 --> 21:43.250
- The Nashville
Chocolate Drops.

21:43.250 --> 21:45.420
So hopefully,
you will like our music

21:45.420 --> 21:46.540
as you like candy.

21:46.540 --> 21:47.960
So we are gonna teach you
a song.

21:47.960 --> 21:48.960
Will you sing with us?

21:48.960 --> 21:50.460
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

21:50.460 --> 21:51.790

a round of applause!

22:41.210 --> 22:44.210
So I have a question
for you guys.

22:44.210 --> 22:46.540
What is this?

22:46.540 --> 22:47.880
- A banjo.
- A banjo!

22:47.880 --> 22:49.460
- A banjo.
People from Africa

22:49.460 --> 22:50.880
brought the idea
of the banjo

22:50.880 --> 22:52.620
over to the United States.

22:52.620 --> 22:54.830
It is over years 160 old.

22:54.830 --> 22:58.880
If I was 160 years old,
how would I walk?

22:58.880 --> 23:01.380
(groans)
Like this.

23:03.920 --> 23:05.620
I'm so glad
you could make it.

23:05.620 --> 23:07.420
- Y'all are incredible.

23:07.420 --> 23:08.880
- Stop. (laughs)

23:08.880 --> 23:11.040
- I'm serious.
Why aren't you recording?

23:11.040 --> 23:13.210
- Who's gonna want to hear
those old songs?

23:13.210 --> 23:16.540
- Are you kidding?
The entire world.

23:16.540 --> 23:19.210
- Oh, yeah, right.

23:19.210 --> 23:21.460
- You stick with me,
Hallie Jordan.

23:21.460 --> 23:23.210
You're gonna make a record.

23:26.580 --> 23:27.880
- Hey, Daphne?

23:27.880 --> 23:30.380
I've heard you sing.

23:32.540 --> 23:35.460
With your sister?

23:37.380 --> 23:39.000
- Yeah, we sing together.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.920
- That's cool.

23:41.920 --> 23:45.620
Did you always do that?

23:45.620 --> 23:47.040
- Not when we were babies.

23:47.040 --> 23:48.710
- Well, I didn't think that.

23:48.710 --> 23:52.380
- No. I mean, yeah,
like a long time.

23:52.380 --> 23:54.380
Like a very long time.

23:54.380 --> 23:56.420
- That's cool.

23:56.420 --> 23:59.170
Here, give me your number.
I'll text you and...

23:59.170 --> 24:01.380

Will Lexington.

25:50.580 --> 25:52.750
- Oh, yeah, we met
at the video shoot.

25:52.750 --> 25:54.710
- I remember.
Good to see you again.

25:54.710 --> 25:56.380
- You a fan of Luke's?

25:56.380 --> 25:58.750
- Yeah.

25:58.750 --> 26:00.880
- All right.
Well, I'm gonna go change.

26:00.880 --> 26:02.380

26:02.380 --> 26:03.500

26:03.500 --> 26:05.380
I'm gonna watch for a while,
but thank you.

- Are you on the list, sir?

26:45.540 --> 26:47.670
- Uh...I doubt it.

26:47.670 --> 26:50.670
- Hey, Rooster, it's all good.
He's a friend.

26:50.670 --> 26:52.210
Come on in.

26:52.210 --> 26:54.290
- Thanks, Rooster.

26:56.170 --> 26:58.960
- I sweat out seven pounds
doing these gigs.

26:58.960 --> 27:02.290
(laughs)
It's like playing football.

27:02.290 --> 27:03.880
You play sports?

27:03.880 --> 27:07.460
- No, I'm afraid
I missed that boat.

27:07.460 --> 27:09.960
- Well, just as well.

27:09.960 --> 27:13.330
Save your body
later in life.

27:13.330 --> 27:15.380
- Yeah.

27:18.250 --> 27:21.830
So the reason we're here,
since you didn't ask,

27:21.830 --> 27:26.790
is Mr. Wheeler
is selling his company,

27:26.790 --> 27:30.120
and Rayna and I
would like to buy it.

27:30.120 --> 27:33.830
Now, Rayna didn't tell you
anything, did she?

27:33.830 --> 27:34.830
- No, sir.

27:34.830 --> 27:36.000
- I asked her not to

27:36.000 --> 27:37.960
at least until the deal
is finalized,

27:37.960 --> 27:43.040
and I was hoping
you would do the same.

27:43.040 --> 27:46.710
- Sorry to hear
that Luke's selling.

27:46.710 --> 27:48.670
He was good to me.

27:48.670 --> 27:49.960
- We'll be better.

27:49.960 --> 27:54.460
Will, we think
you're very special.

27:54.460 --> 27:55.830
- Yeah. Special is a word

27:55.830 --> 27:58.330
that's applied to me
fairly often these days.

27:58.330 --> 27:59.580
- Yeah, and by idiots.

27:59.580 --> 28:01.080
We have plans for you, Will,

28:01.080 --> 28:03.670
big plans that I doubt
Luke's people ever thought of.

28:03.670 --> 28:05.620
- Well, it sounds like you want
to send me to the moon.

28:05.620 --> 28:08.040
- That's actually
a friend of mine's project.

28:08.040 --> 28:09.750
I was thinking
more earthbound,

28:09.750 --> 28:12.880
but definitely
beyond Nashville.

28:14.040 --> 28:16.620
So you have my number.

28:16.620 --> 28:18.290
Call me.

28:18.290 --> 28:21.210
I'd love to get to know you
a little while I'm here.

28:21.210 --> 28:24.540
- You seem to know
a lot of people already.

28:24.540 --> 28:25.790
- That's a guest list.

28:25.790 --> 28:28.170
This is different.

28:31.580 --> 28:33.000
- Busted.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.670
- You caught me.
- I did.

28:34.670 --> 28:36.710
- (laughs) You telling?

28:36.710 --> 28:38.120
- Not if you get me some.

28:38.120 --> 28:39.960
- Deal.

28:39.960 --> 28:42.330
- So Mom's out
with Luke Wheeler,

28:42.330 --> 28:44.880
and you're jealous.

28:44.880 --> 28:46.120
- Look at me.

28:48.250 --> 28:51.040
- I'm so happy
she married you.

28:51.040 --> 28:53.330
- That makes two of us.

28:59.120 --> 29:00.710
What?

29:00.710 --> 29:02.330
- I don't know.

29:04.170 --> 29:07.040
How do you know
when something's right?

29:09.460 --> 29:12.540
- Aren't you a little young
to be thinking about all that?

29:12.540 --> 29:14.210
- (sighs)

29:14.210 --> 29:16.330
- I mean, you should just
be out there meeting people,

29:16.330 --> 29:18.210
seeing what you like,
seeing what you don't.

29:18.210 --> 29:20.670
Slow down. It's all gonna
get complicated soon enough.

29:20.670 --> 29:22.710
- Mom met you
when she was my age.

29:22.710 --> 29:24.960
- I was afraid
you were gonna say that.

29:24.960 --> 29:26.750
- I don't know.

29:26.750 --> 29:29.170
I had this thing
the other day.

29:29.170 --> 29:34.540
I just realized
people are like worlds,

29:34.540 --> 29:36.620
like whole worlds inside.

29:36.620 --> 29:38.540
So big, you know.

29:38.540 --> 29:39.920
Everyone's walking around

29:39.920 --> 29:43.880
like with their own history
and feelings

29:43.880 --> 29:46.880
and different ways
of seeing things,

29:46.880 --> 29:51.380
and it just
boggles my mind.

29:53.420 --> 29:58.210
- And you just thought
of this the other day?

29:59.540 --> 30:01.420
At 17?

30:01.420 --> 30:04.000
- Yeah.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.420
- You're something else,
girl.

30:08.210 --> 30:10.040
- It also scares me,
you know.

30:10.040 --> 30:13.790
Like how do two people
ever find common ground?

30:13.790 --> 30:15.960
(cell phone rings)

30:17.620 --> 30:19.420
- You can get it.
- No, it's okay.

30:19.420 --> 30:21.040
- No, seriously. Go ahead.

30:22.420 --> 30:25.460
- I honestly don't know
what to say to him right now.

30:30.790 --> 30:33.380
- I've walked that buffet
too many times.

30:33.380 --> 30:34.670
You sure
you don't want anything?

30:34.670 --> 30:37.210
- No. I ate already.
- Mr. Welles?

30:37.210 --> 30:39.580
- Oh, no, thank you.
And please call me Zach.

30:39.580 --> 30:41.670
Mr. Welles was my father
and not a very pleasant man.

30:41.670 --> 30:43.210
- Well, he must have been
friends with mine.

30:43.210 --> 30:45.960
Come on, let's have a seat.
We can chat.

30:45.960 --> 30:47.540
It's good to see you, Rayna.

30:47.540 --> 30:49.330
You look like a happy woman.

30:49.330 --> 30:52.380
- Well, thank you.
It's good to see you, too.

30:52.380 --> 30:54.580
- So I'm thrilled y'all
came out to hear me sing,

30:54.580 --> 30:58.000
but I'm guessing
that's not the whole story.

30:58.000 --> 31:01.000
- Well, yeah.

31:01.000 --> 31:05.880
We heard you might be interested
in selling Wheelin' Dealin'.

31:05.880 --> 31:08.080
- Whoa. So much for secrets.

31:08.080 --> 31:09.830
- Well, it's Nashville,
honey.

31:09.830 --> 31:12.920
- And as Rayna knows, I do
pride myself on my research.

31:12.920 --> 31:16.880
- If I didn't know better, I'd
say you had my office bugged.

31:16.880 --> 31:18.880
- (laughs)

31:18.880 --> 31:20.210
Not quite.

31:20.210 --> 31:23.670
- Well, do you?
Is it true?

31:23.670 --> 31:27.040
- Ever since
the whole IRS thing,

31:27.040 --> 31:29.710
my heart's
just not been in it.

31:29.710 --> 31:33.540
Phone calls, meetings,
emails all the time.

31:33.540 --> 31:36.580
What I'd rather do is sit
on my farm, write some songs,

31:36.580 --> 31:39.000
and then go fun places
and sing 'em.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.170
- Good for you.

31:40.170 --> 31:42.080
- Sounds amazing.

31:42.080 --> 31:45.960
And I think
we can help you do that.

31:45.960 --> 31:47.420
- You can?

31:47.420 --> 31:49.880
- Well, Zach sort of
has it in his mind

31:49.880 --> 31:53.620
that he would like to buy
Wheelin' Dealin' for Highway 65.

31:53.620 --> 31:54.830
- Interesting.

31:54.830 --> 31:56.500
- We would protect your artists,
including you.

31:56.500 --> 31:59.460
- Oh, I'm sure you would.

31:59.460 --> 32:02.250
- But, look,
if it's too weird--

32:02.250 --> 32:04.540
- Why would it be weird?
- (laughs)

32:04.540 --> 32:08.880
- You know what, son?
Could you give us a moment?

32:08.880 --> 32:09.960
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

32:09.960 --> 32:12.710
(chuckles)

32:14.380 --> 32:15.790
It really is good
to see you, Rayna.

32:15.790 --> 32:19.380
- You too. I'm glad
to see you looking so happy.

32:19.380 --> 32:22.210
- Well, I am.
- Good.

32:22.210 --> 32:24.790
- You want me to do this?

32:24.790 --> 32:28.290
- Look, I want you to do
whatever you want to do.

32:28.290 --> 32:31.210
- Do you trust him?

32:31.210 --> 32:34.710
- So far, yeah.

32:34.710 --> 32:37.250
- Okay, then.

32:38.830 --> 32:42.880
- Okay? Okay, that's it?

32:42.880 --> 32:44.880
- I trust you, Rayna.

32:44.880 --> 32:47.000
- That's kind of amazing.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.420
- It took me a while
to understand

32:49.420 --> 32:53.960
that you and me,
we would have been a mistake.

32:53.960 --> 32:56.000
But you saw it and I didn't,

32:56.000 --> 32:59.040
and I give you
all the credit for that.

32:59.040 --> 33:05.290
So, yeah, if your Zach Welles
is interested in buying,

33:05.290 --> 33:07.830
I'm interested in selling.

33:09.500 --> 33:11.210
(chuckles)

33:13.750 --> 33:15.250
- Hey, it's Clay.

33:15.250 --> 33:18.880
Listen, Maddie,
no need to worry, okay?

33:18.880 --> 33:20.420
I get it.

33:20.420 --> 33:23.080
I want you
to have a good life,

33:23.080 --> 33:25.000
because you deserve that.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.580
So you take care,

33:26.580 --> 33:29.580
and you better
write some songs.

33:29.580 --> 33:31.330
I'll see you.

33:42.710 --> 33:44.710
- I'm awake.

33:44.710 --> 33:47.380
- You look serene.

33:47.380 --> 33:51.210
- No one's
ever said that before.

33:51.210 --> 33:53.250
- You wear it well.

33:53.250 --> 33:58.670
- I feel like this change,
it's kind of amazing.

33:58.670 --> 34:02.710
- Is this from getting better
or from the church?

34:02.710 --> 34:07.960
- Everything.
But, yeah, the church.

34:07.960 --> 34:11.750
- That's very cool.

34:11.750 --> 34:13.420
- You're skeptical.

34:13.420 --> 34:16.670
- No. It's just never really
been your thing, you know.

34:16.670 --> 34:20.250
- Neither was being paralyzed
in a plane crash.

34:20.250 --> 34:22.000
- Fair enough.

34:22.000 --> 34:25.790
Look, Juliette, if this
helps you, I'm all for it.

34:25.790 --> 34:29.500
- I'm not just doing this
because it helps me.

34:29.500 --> 34:33.620
It goes so much deeper
than that.

34:33.620 --> 34:35.790
- Then tell me.

34:35.790 --> 34:40.380
I want to know.

34:40.380 --> 34:42.210
- No, you don't.
If you wanted to know,

34:42.210 --> 34:43.710
you wouldn't ask like that.

34:43.710 --> 34:47.710
- Like what?
Okay, what is going on here?

34:47.710 --> 34:52.210
- Sometimes I just feel like
you want me to be unhappy.

34:52.210 --> 34:53.460
- Oh, my God.

34:53.460 --> 34:55.380
- As long as I am miserable
and suffering,

34:55.380 --> 34:56.500
you're totally fine.

34:56.500 --> 34:57.880
But as soon
as I find something--

34:57.880 --> 34:59.420
- Hey, hold on a second.
That is totally unfair.

34:59.420 --> 35:01.380
I've been here every second.

35:01.380 --> 35:04.880
- Until I'm better, and then...
- I'm still here.

35:07.080 --> 35:13.790
- I feel...this change
happening inside,

35:13.790 --> 35:17.040
like I'm coming out of myself
for the first time.

35:17.040 --> 35:20.170
- That's wonderful.

35:20.170 --> 35:21.830
- I don't know why

35:21.830 --> 35:26.670
and I'm just afraid
it's gonna go away

35:26.670 --> 35:30.040
and I'm convinced that people
just won't quite accept it.

35:30.040 --> 35:33.210
- Hey, they'll accept it.

35:33.210 --> 35:36.750
- Sorry, guys, but I think
you should see this.

35:36.750 --> 35:38.080
- Oh, what is it?

35:38.080 --> 35:39.750
- Put on your Sunday best,

35:39.750 --> 35:43.080
because country music star
Juliette Barnes

35:43.080 --> 35:45.250
is going to church.

35:45.250 --> 35:47.290
Miss Barnes,
who is still unable to walk

35:47.290 --> 35:48.750
after
her recent plane crash,

35:48.750 --> 35:52.000
is apparently seeking help
from a higher power.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.580
- Juliette Barnes finds
religion? There's a twist.

35:54.580 --> 35:55.830
- Yeah.
I think she's hoping

35:55.830 --> 35:58.040
the church will do
what rehab couldn't.

35:58.040 --> 35:59.210
- She's praying
any producer

35:59.210 --> 36:01.080
will want to work
with her again.

36:01.080 --> 36:03.210
- Hmm.

36:03.210 --> 36:05.620
- There's Flynn.

36:05.620 --> 36:08.040
- I was weird to him
the other day.

36:08.040 --> 36:09.330
- What did you do?

36:09.330 --> 36:11.290
- I tried to talk
and nothing came out.

36:11.290 --> 36:12.880
- You can do it now.
- No, I can't.

36:12.880 --> 36:14.000
- Hey, Flynn!

36:14.000 --> 36:15.830
- Shut up.
What are you doing?

36:15.830 --> 36:17.460
- Be right back.

36:18.750 --> 36:19.750
What's up?

36:21.170 --> 36:25.380
- So do you still
want my number?

36:25.380 --> 36:26.880
- Not if you're weird.

36:26.880 --> 36:29.290
- I'm no weirder than you.

36:29.290 --> 36:32.120
- Yeah, I want it.

36:32.120 --> 36:33.710
- Daphne?

36:36.880 --> 36:38.580
- Who are you?

36:38.580 --> 36:42.380
- I'm a friend of Rayna's
of many years.

36:42.380 --> 36:46.120
- You don't know my mom.

36:46.120 --> 36:48.290
- Well, give this to her.

36:48.290 --> 36:49.790
That's all.

36:49.790 --> 36:50.880
- Help!
- Help!

36:59.710 --> 37:01.040
- Well, he'll be held
until arraignment.

37:01.040 --> 37:02.210
Then a judge will charge him

37:02.210 --> 37:04.040
with violating
the restraining order.

37:04.040 --> 37:05.210
- Can he get out on bail?

37:05.210 --> 37:06.460
- Not if he's considered
a threat.

37:06.460 --> 37:07.580
- He accosted our daughter
at school.

37:07.580 --> 37:09.210
- He violated that order,
honey.

37:09.210 --> 37:10.330
He ain't going nowhere.

37:10.330 --> 37:12.040
- This is really scary.
- I know.

37:12.040 --> 37:13.380
Let's just head home.

37:13.380 --> 37:15.540
- Yeah.
Let's go, sweetheart.

37:15.540 --> 37:17.380
Thank y'all very much.
Thank you.

37:17.380 --> 37:19.790
- I'm fine.

37:19.790 --> 37:21.710
- You don't want to go home?

37:21.710 --> 37:24.670
I'm a mess and he didn't even
talk to me, sweetie. You sure?

37:24.670 --> 37:27.580
- He didn't attack me.
He gave me a letter.

37:27.580 --> 37:29.880
- Well, honey, I think I'd feel
better having you home.

37:29.880 --> 37:31.210
You're not upset?

37:31.210 --> 37:32.710
- Do you want me
to be upset?

37:32.710 --> 37:35.380
- No. In fact, I think
you handled it amazingly.

37:35.380 --> 37:38.460
I'm very proud of you,
but I just...

37:38.460 --> 37:39.750
- We have concert rehearsal,

37:39.750 --> 37:41.000
so I will see you guys
later.

37:46.540 --> 37:48.540
- Is that okay?

37:48.540 --> 37:50.080
- Well, she's certainly
not in any danger.

37:50.080 --> 37:52.380
Look, I know this is very
upsetting to both of you,

37:52.380 --> 37:54.120
but as long
as she's okay with it,

37:54.120 --> 37:55.580
we're probably better off

37:55.580 --> 37:59.040
not making her think it's
a bigger thing than it is.

37:59.040 --> 38:01.750
- Right, right.

38:01.750 --> 38:03.380
Okay, thanks.
