WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:02.084
- Previously on Wynonna Earp.
- You are now consultant deputy

00:02.120 --> 00:04.780
- for the Black Badge Division.
- Regular guns can slow

00:04.814 --> 00:06.921
the revheads down.

00:06.964 --> 00:09.003
Only Peacemaker puts them down for good.

00:09.580 --> 00:12.212
You want to escape the Triangle
and feast on everything?

00:12.247 --> 00:15.045
- Boss, it's all I want.
- I'm Nicole. Nicole Haught.

00:15.111 --> 00:17.333
I'm in a relationship with a boy. Man!

00:17.385 --> 00:19.420
A boy-man is the worst.

00:19.472 --> 00:22.013
It's just a matter of
time before they figure out

00:22.060 --> 00:24.315
- who I really am.
- You got a problem with that?

00:24.350 --> 00:26.576
The only one about to have a problem...

00:26.658 --> 00:28.033
Bad move, revenant!

00:28.489 --> 00:30.664
Is Wynonna.

00:31.143 --> 00:33.667
Last one, Shorty.

00:33.808 --> 00:35.674
I'll take that.

00:35.710 --> 00:37.393
With that ticker? The hell you will.

00:37.427 --> 00:39.731
I ain't keeling over any time soon.

00:39.828 --> 00:43.155
Nice to see you girls moving in
together. It's too bad she's got so much stuff.

00:43.191 --> 00:45.451
Well if you weren't so
short-staffed, maybe Waverly

00:45.563 --> 00:48.432
- could carry her own crap!
- Love you, sis!

00:52.304 --> 00:54.287
Buy me a round, Henry?

00:54.426 --> 00:58.424
Oh, you are awful
forward for a girl in dungarees.

00:58.460 --> 01:00.960
Seems like it's the least you can do.

01:01.353 --> 01:03.465
Met guys like you before.

01:03.744 --> 01:05.400
Maybe not the OK-Corral shtick,

01:05.435 --> 01:07.855
but charming loners who
would drink too much.

01:07.890 --> 01:10.243
Oh, don't forget, can't
find honest work.

01:10.278 --> 01:13.203
Mm. They're always either

01:13.304 --> 01:16.944
running from or looking for something.

01:17.353 --> 01:19.737
Seems like you're just my type.

01:23.525 --> 01:25.799
What makes you think that you are mine?

01:27.000 --> 01:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:35.289 --> 01:37.146
There's something about him,

01:37.194 --> 01:39.332
- you know, in the eyes.
- OK.

01:39.421 --> 01:40.909
You know what? We can't
all settle down with

01:40.944 --> 01:44.554
- our high-school sweethearts.
- Hmm, still.

01:44.632 --> 01:46.776
I've met worse guys than Henry.

01:46.811 --> 01:50.394
Oh, I'm sorry, "met"?

01:50.487 --> 01:52.561
OK, when you're done
judging me, make sure

01:52.640 --> 01:55.015
you're ready to drop your
research on Dolls tomorrow.

01:55.123 --> 01:57.296
Oh, I'm ready. And believe me,

01:57.358 --> 01:59.491
you are gonna dig it.

02:01.433 --> 02:04.126
Over a hundred years ago,

02:04.161 --> 02:06.192
the wife of one of our founding fathers

02:06.194 --> 02:08.193
buried a time capsule.

02:08.424 --> 02:10.828
And though she could neither
hear nor speak,

02:10.931 --> 02:12.120
Shirley Dixon's words

02:12.155 --> 02:14.993
live on in the poetry she left behind.

02:15.252 --> 02:17.551
15 years you've been gone;

02:17.638 --> 02:18.884
you sure it's in there?

02:18.938 --> 02:21.258
As sure as I'm
resurrected and standing here.

02:21.346 --> 02:23.748
I buried it here myself in 1906.

02:23.783 --> 02:26.251
With a new library coming to this site,

02:26.340 --> 02:29.406
it's time to unearth the past. Alright.

02:38.597 --> 02:40.980
Let's find out what she left us.

02:45.002 --> 02:47.033
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey! You can't get...

02:47.069 --> 02:49.870
- No! No, you can't!
- Oh, my God!

02:50.391 --> 02:52.861
- Call the police!
- Haha! Here it is.

02:52.966 --> 02:54.740
Dixon's diary.

02:54.855 --> 02:57.856
"Voice of a mute." Well done.

03:01.319 --> 03:03.758
Sammy, I'm getting an itch here.

03:03.889 --> 03:06.990
Can I just do one? Please, Sam?

03:07.060 --> 03:11.508
That is a valuable piece of local
history! Someone, call the police!

03:11.616 --> 03:14.191
This one has to hold
you, Marty. Make it quick.

03:16.481 --> 03:18.564
No! I-I... Oh!

03:18.600 --> 03:21.985
Oh! What are you? Why...

03:22.599 --> 03:24.237
Why are you doing this?

03:24.527 --> 03:26.281
Just leave this place!

03:26.316 --> 03:29.408
Trust me... we're trying.

03:29.490 --> 03:31.027
Argh!

03:34.115 --> 03:37.867
Oh!

03:59.079 --> 04:02.170
So, everything from the
mountains to where the North

04:02.205 --> 04:05.893
and South Ghost rivers meet forms
the Ghost River Triangle.

04:05.927 --> 04:06.961
OK?

04:06.997 --> 04:08.805
Yeah. It cuts through
the big city, contains

04:08.867 --> 04:11.913
thousands of square
miles of forest, foothills,

04:11.948 --> 04:13.924
prairie, uh, the Badlands.

04:13.959 --> 04:17.790
- And all of it... cursed.
- Yeah,

04:17.826 --> 04:19.449
the Earp Curse. What's wrong?

04:19.485 --> 04:21.161
Oh, nothing. It's just, um...

04:21.345 --> 04:23.026
It's been a long time since
I said it out loud.

04:23.060 --> 04:25.307
You know, sounds a
little cuckoo bananas.

04:25.427 --> 04:26.822
Hell, this isn't my first time hearing

04:26.862 --> 04:31.321
about demonic maledictions or
enclaves of evil. Proceed.

04:31.422 --> 04:33.769
Yes, Waverly, "proceed."

04:33.814 --> 04:35.259
Um, ahem...

04:35.310 --> 04:36.769
So the Triangle
seems to act as some sort

04:36.824 --> 04:39.384
of prison, right? Any
revenants who try to cross

04:39.439 --> 04:42.264
- the boundaries...
- Wait-wait! I know this one.

04:42.345 --> 04:44.225
Daddy said, "Peeps who
try to cross the boundary

04:44.231 --> 04:46.519
- suffer hell on earth."
- They're not people.

04:46.658 --> 04:48.774
- They used to be.
- OK, so these outlaws-turned-demons,

04:48.808 --> 04:50.911
- can you ID them?
- Um, yeah, well...

04:50.966 --> 04:55.278
I... I-I had some names in this
ledger, right, which, uh...

04:55.723 --> 04:58.274
which was... Anyway.

04:58.310 --> 05:01.458
Um, I can still make out a
few of them from old photos,

05:01.492 --> 05:04.086
and I have a really, really
good hunch about some others.

05:04.160 --> 05:06.872
OK, well, my
superiors frown upon hunches.

05:06.963 --> 05:09.237
So if this Triangle is a
prison, then we're the wardens.

05:09.273 --> 05:12.992
I mean, we gotta identify the
prisoners and keep them contained.

05:13.086 --> 05:15.716
By shooting them in the face.

05:15.824 --> 05:17.144
Starting with the seven revenants

05:17.173 --> 05:19.939
that attacked our
homestead and killed our sister.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.956
I want them to
tremble with fear before me.

05:23.024 --> 05:25.024
You got powdered sugar on your nose.

05:29.536 --> 05:31.797
These will be great resources.

05:31.922 --> 05:34.471
Sorry. Uh, I spent
years on that research so...

05:34.516 --> 05:37.153
Welcome to Team Shut-Up-and-Do
What-He-Says.

05:37.810 --> 05:40.824
Sometimes, we get donuts.

05:40.954 --> 05:42.786
Ooh.

05:48.016 --> 05:49.274
Enter.

05:50.959 --> 05:52.577
Hey. You asked to be alerted

05:52.612 --> 05:55.733
whenever things come over the
wire that seem... unusual?

05:55.768 --> 05:58.824
Yeah, we're coming.
Thanks. Waverly, you're dismissed.

06:07.288 --> 06:09.603
- So, that's it?
- He's not really

06:09.708 --> 06:14.083
the Let's-go-for-drinks-and-celebrate
type. You did great! Yep!

06:14.574 --> 06:16.942
Sure.

06:17.610 --> 06:19.495
Oh!

06:19.940 --> 06:23.617
Ha! Get back here, Doc Holliday.

06:23.668 --> 06:26.302
Ohhhh... shit!

06:26.559 --> 06:27.620
No...

06:35.608 --> 06:38.879
Who is it?

06:40.754 --> 06:43.896
- Bobo sent me.
- Inside now.

06:46.475 --> 06:50.225
I question

06:50.288 --> 06:53.691
what sort of a man sends an
angel to do his bidding.

06:53.762 --> 06:56.100
I don't know no Angel. Name's Bethany.

06:56.136 --> 06:59.223
Bethany. Lovely, darling. Now,
am I to assume that you have

06:59.269 --> 07:03.939
the vital information that
Bobo knows that I so sorely desire?

07:04.062 --> 07:06.016
- Bobo's got another job for you.
- Well, he has not

07:06.050 --> 07:10.814
paid me for the last one, so
I decline. With prejudice.

07:10.899 --> 07:13.257
Bobo tells us to do
things, and we do 'em.

07:13.291 --> 07:15.725
- That's the deal around here.
- Not for me.

07:17.505 --> 07:19.505
I hear you're brave.

07:19.668 --> 07:21.341
Good with a gun.

07:21.702 --> 07:23.343
I hear you're also famous for...

07:23.425 --> 07:25.345
Bravery...

07:25.396 --> 07:28.398
is just a fancy word for stupid.

07:28.434 --> 07:31.514
Please refrain from accusing
me of such foolishness.

07:33.300 --> 07:36.689
Now, as for my prowess

07:36.853 --> 07:39.399
with a gun... you tell Bobo

07:39.435 --> 07:41.901
to drag his corrupt
corpse down to my trailer

07:41.956 --> 07:44.197
and tell me what I wanna know,

07:44.340 --> 07:46.909
or he will gain some
first-hand knowledge

07:47.000 --> 07:49.889
of the efficacy of my shot.

07:51.478 --> 07:54.108
If what I hear is true, it's
been a hell of a long time

07:54.144 --> 07:56.879
since you taught anyone a lesson.

08:02.478 --> 08:04.416
Unless you don't wanna.

08:04.807 --> 08:06.519
Well now, ma'am, I...

08:06.687 --> 08:08.285
I did not say that.

08:08.338 --> 08:09.971
And this will really piss Bobo off.

08:10.069 --> 08:13.047
The cherry on my sundae.

08:19.127 --> 08:21.201
- What makes this ours?
- The deputy mayor's body

08:21.235 --> 08:25.288
- was fileted. Like a fish.
- Ah, fish death

08:25.322 --> 08:27.240
equals Black Badge, got it.

08:27.692 --> 08:29.798
They also took Shirley Dixon's journal.

08:29.834 --> 08:32.633
- Theories?
- You mean, like a hunch?

08:34.697 --> 08:37.837
Well, the diary of our country's
most beloved deaf-mute poet

08:37.918 --> 08:39.573
could bring in some serious coin.

08:39.629 --> 08:43.049
Why kill the deputy mayor in
front of dozens of witnesses?

08:43.159 --> 08:46.695
- They must've really wanted it.
- Along with his severed hand.

08:46.889 --> 08:49.440
- Say what?
- This came in a few days ago.

08:51.099 --> 08:53.663
Oh, viewer discretion is advised.

08:53.735 --> 08:56.009
- I think I can handle it.
- OK...

08:56.095 --> 08:58.581
- Can't say I didn't warn you.
- Oh, my God!

09:03.464 --> 09:05.445
How dull is that knife?

09:06.381 --> 09:08.139
Oh, he's gonna miss his bus.

09:08.220 --> 09:12.118
Hahahahaha!

09:13.303 --> 09:14.796
Play it again.

09:17.125 --> 09:20.711
Hahahahaha!

09:20.769 --> 09:22.809
See how he moves? Freaky.

09:22.873 --> 09:26.807
Could be mimicking a
hellhound. Strong, fast,

09:26.841 --> 09:29.292
finely tuned sense of smell...

09:36.004 --> 09:39.082
Girly, you killed your own daddy.

09:39.193 --> 09:42.850
Did our work for us!

09:42.884 --> 09:44.451
Earp.

09:44.485 --> 09:46.952
He's one of the Seven.
He was there that night.

09:47.187 --> 09:49.463
What did they want with a
book and an old dude's paw?

09:49.510 --> 09:51.240
All these items are carefully curated.

09:51.287 --> 09:53.493
My theory is that they're
collecting rarities

09:53.544 --> 09:55.634
- for a ritual.
- What, like Voodoo?

09:55.668 --> 09:58.234
Uh, more like Dark-Ages
European than Haitian.

09:58.336 --> 09:59.816
Sometimes, you come
so close to cool, and

09:59.885 --> 10:02.621
- then cool makes a run for it.
- The victim was Mel Cleghorn.

10:02.668 --> 10:05.087
50 years ago, he was charged with
the killing of his girlfriend.

10:05.139 --> 10:08.107
All evidence pointed to his
guilt, but he was let off.

10:08.177 --> 10:13.346
And legend has it the left hand of
an innocent murderer can open gateways.

10:13.440 --> 10:15.559
They're trying to get out of
the Ghost River Triangle.

10:15.639 --> 10:17.429
They can't. It's impossible.

10:17.514 --> 10:19.732
- I hope so.
- OK, a mute's voice,

10:19.772 --> 10:22.174
- an innocent killer; what's next?
- Now, these things

10:22.236 --> 10:26.245
usually come in
threes, mundus triformis.

10:26.697 --> 10:27.417
- Uh?
- It's a kind

10:27.451 --> 10:31.740
of paradox, like cold
fire, the living dead.

10:31.865 --> 10:33.238
- Ohhh, OK.
- Yeah.

10:33.273 --> 10:35.932
I'll keep my eyes open for a zombie
wearing an icy-hot patch.

10:35.995 --> 10:38.823
Come on, Earp, this ain't no
joke. If the revenants escape,

10:38.878 --> 10:40.751
they can scatter to the
four corners of the world,

10:40.790 --> 10:43.864
ignite a shit storm of
rape, murder, pillaging.

10:43.950 --> 10:45.647
Well, the pillaging, we could handle.

10:45.682 --> 10:48.533
OK, where are you going? We've
got work to do. Earp!

10:48.610 --> 10:50.835
Earp! We've got a
description of the van.

10:50.870 --> 10:54.513
Yeah. I need to think. And
tequila. Mucho tequila.

11:01.202 --> 11:03.562
Sir! what are you doing?!

11:03.615 --> 11:06.899
Sir!

11:07.072 --> 11:09.369
No! NO!

11:15.043 --> 11:17.563
Oh, so that's why you're
here? You're running a book?

11:17.642 --> 11:19.822
On frontier life. But I am lately

11:19.884 --> 11:21.908
stumped. I seek the name and likeness

11:22.001 --> 11:24.634
of a figure once
prominent in these parts.

11:24.750 --> 11:26.592
Well, I have collected

11:26.678 --> 11:30.095
almost every back issue of
the Ghost River Chronicle.

11:30.173 --> 11:32.563
A bit of a local history nut myself.

11:32.665 --> 11:34.836
So, this guy that you're looking for...

11:34.890 --> 11:37.373
- It's a woman.
- OK...

11:37.418 --> 11:38.662
Um...

11:38.716 --> 11:40.187
Ooh! Here we go!

11:40.673 --> 11:42.188
Look familiar?

11:42.899 --> 11:45.076
"Big Nose Kate."

11:45.177 --> 11:49.701
Long-time companion of
a famous gunslinger...

11:49.783 --> 11:51.173
_

11:52.528 --> 11:55.081
Not the filly I'm
looking for. Think blonde.

11:55.152 --> 11:57.753
Think striking.

11:57.956 --> 12:00.390
Men always do.

12:00.476 --> 12:02.715
Why don't you look up the
"Last spike" ceremony.

12:02.807 --> 12:04.985
I may recall her being there...

12:05.086 --> 12:07.464
so I've read.

12:07.682 --> 12:09.528
Of course.

12:09.966 --> 12:11.259
OK...

12:11.331 --> 12:14.517
"May, 1882."

12:14.618 --> 12:17.413
No. No photos.

12:17.533 --> 12:19.366
Recognize any names?

12:19.705 --> 12:22.171
_

12:26.610 --> 12:28.451
Well, I appreciate the help,

12:28.486 --> 12:31.455
- but I best be heading off.
- Oh.

12:31.490 --> 12:35.125
Oh. Uhhh...

12:35.557 --> 12:36.993
So...

12:37.322 --> 12:40.023
if I do find anything, uh,

12:40.092 --> 12:41.447
where are you staying?

12:41.481 --> 12:43.381
A place young ladies should not venture.

12:43.417 --> 12:46.366
A trailer park,
proprietered by one Bobo Del Rey.

12:47.971 --> 12:49.505
O... Oh.

12:50.290 --> 12:52.211
Much obliged, ma'am.

12:57.014 --> 13:00.517
OK.

13:04.690 --> 13:06.690
Hey, Daddy. Hi, Willa.

13:09.445 --> 13:11.528
Sorry, I don't visit much,

13:11.529 --> 13:13.779
but you're not even in there.

13:13.831 --> 13:17.200
Nothing but sand in your casket.

13:21.840 --> 13:23.789
This is your gig.

13:23.841 --> 13:27.376
You should be doing
this. You were meant to.

13:28.963 --> 13:30.931
I miss you guys so damn much.

13:33.601 --> 13:36.186
The numbers. I need those numbers.

13:38.190 --> 13:40.106
Little respect here? Trying to have

13:40.142 --> 13:43.476
- a moment with my family!
- He'll tell me the numbers!

13:48.232 --> 13:51.534
Whoa! Pretty sure this is illegal.

13:51.570 --> 13:53.903
Sam wants the numbers.

13:53.905 --> 13:55.905
Stan knows them.

13:55.957 --> 13:59.209
- Just gotta ask him.
- Hmm, doubt you're gonna

13:59.244 --> 14:01.076
get much out of Johnny McDead here.

14:01.078 --> 14:03.913
- You OK, pal? Off your meds?
- Three of them

14:03.966 --> 14:06.416
made me what I am!

14:06.418 --> 14:09.418
BANG! Where I am? Hell? Must be Hell.

14:09.421 --> 14:13.255
But I come back!

14:20.231 --> 14:22.899
You.

14:22.934 --> 14:24.900
- Never going back.
- Oh,

14:24.937 --> 14:28.772
you're going back,
revenant. And you're gonna burn.

14:38.450 --> 14:42.284
Christ, he is fast!

14:53.881 --> 14:57.299
I ran the name on the
headstone. Stanley Gatewood.

14:57.302 --> 14:59.970
- Hello to you too, Dolls.
- Managed the Bank of Purgatory

15:00.022 --> 15:01.971
in the 70s. Hired a
man by the name of Marty

15:02.024 --> 15:04.224
who took great pleasure in
foreclosing on farmers.

15:04.275 --> 15:06.308
Why didn't you shoot him?

15:06.311 --> 15:08.360
He moves like he's krumping, remember?

15:08.397 --> 15:11.981
But he dropped this...

15:12.033 --> 15:13.732
You're welcome.

15:13.784 --> 15:16.620
Passwords? Bank accounts?

15:16.654 --> 15:19.371
Combination? But the Bank of Purgatory

15:19.408 --> 15:21.791
- is now a surplus store.
- Contractors build around

15:21.826 --> 15:23.626
old vaults that are too
big to move. Down that coffee

15:23.662 --> 15:26.996
- and we'll go.
- It's really hot.

15:26.999 --> 15:30.049
Fine! Hmm!

15:39.061 --> 15:42.095
There, the van. We're too late.

15:42.147 --> 15:44.681
OK, we're gonna take cover and regroup.

15:44.682 --> 15:47.100
We don't want to tip them off.

15:47.152 --> 15:49.269
Good thing we're not
driving a giant narcmobile.

15:49.321 --> 15:52.688
Yeah, it's just a
two-inch clamp for my tow hook.

15:52.740 --> 15:54.691
Think it'll be expensive?

15:54.743 --> 15:57.360
Less than the ring you owe Waverly.

15:57.412 --> 16:00.196
Oh, sorry.

16:00.249 --> 16:02.197
Look at that body.

16:02.250 --> 16:04.200
I call dibs!

16:04.201 --> 16:06.201
Thanks. I get that a lot.

16:06.203 --> 16:07.537
Shit!

16:07.589 --> 16:10.206
Everybody on the ground!

16:10.259 --> 16:13.426
- Plan B, boys, we got company!
- Ah!

16:15.013 --> 16:17.764
Stay back! We got hostages!

16:19.600 --> 16:21.017
Go!

16:26.441 --> 16:28.921
Hostages. Good, right? Means they're
not going to kill them.

16:28.922 --> 16:30.174
Not yet.

16:30.817 --> 16:32.904
Everybody hand over your phones. Now.

16:32.995 --> 16:35.269
Who still carries phones, right?

16:35.457 --> 16:40.076
Don't make me damage what
will soon be mine!

16:40.129 --> 16:43.246
Don't do this, fellas. You
haven't hurt anybody yet.

16:43.249 --> 16:45.749
Just take what's in the register,
leave out the back.

16:53.091 --> 16:55.424
Ugh! Ah!

16:55.427 --> 16:57.760
Keep your head!

16:57.812 --> 16:59.846
That bitch outside can send
us all back to Hell,

16:59.899 --> 17:02.099
and these hostages are our
only bargaining chips!

17:02.150 --> 17:04.934
You and you, head to the back!
You behind the desk, follow 'em.

17:04.987 --> 17:07.270
Get him off the floor!

17:07.323 --> 17:09.771
Now!

17:09.825 --> 17:11.942
We're close, boys! Marty, move
your ass, find the vault.

17:11.992 --> 17:14.111
Gary, you help him.

17:14.113 --> 17:16.113
Alone?

17:16.115 --> 17:18.414
Why are we not going in
there and shooting these bastards?

17:18.450 --> 17:19.785
Do the odds. You think we can subdue

17:19.809 --> 17:21.084
all three before they kill anyone?

17:21.118 --> 17:24.872
Oh, the cavalry. Just in time.

17:24.923 --> 17:26.789
Ah, great.

17:26.842 --> 17:28.791
Got a report of shots fired,

17:28.844 --> 17:30.794
hostage situation. I call the Tac team?

17:30.846 --> 17:32.727
It'll take them an hour
to get here from the city.

17:32.751 --> 17:33.832
You take your cues from me.

17:33.848 --> 17:36.048
So we just stand around with
our thumbs up our asses?

17:36.101 --> 17:39.269
And if that's how you've
been trained, feel free.

17:41.222 --> 17:43.140
Hostage taking is
about bargaining, right?

17:43.192 --> 17:45.275
We have things they want.

17:45.310 --> 17:48.311
- The combination?
- And the Earp heir.

17:48.314 --> 17:50.314
No. Too risky. They'll kill you.

17:50.316 --> 17:52.900
You said it yourself, they're
trying to piece together

17:52.951 --> 17:54.493
some kind of spell, so if they think

17:54.519 --> 17:56.036
I can help them get what they want,

17:56.070 --> 17:58.322
then that's gotta be worth
every person in there.

18:02.493 --> 18:04.493
Give this to whoever's in charge.

18:04.496 --> 18:06.059
- And...
- Never get into a vehicle,

18:06.085 --> 18:07.497
never move to a second location.

18:07.499 --> 18:09.465
You've been in a
hostage situation before?

18:09.500 --> 18:12.336
- Sort of.
- This time, you're the law,

18:12.387 --> 18:14.471
and innocent people
are depending on you.

18:14.506 --> 18:17.217
- Now, your gun.
- What?!

18:17.461 --> 18:20.009
They're not gonna let you in
there with it. I'll get it

18:20.061 --> 18:21.678
back to you, Earp. I promise.

18:39.748 --> 18:41.498
Ok.

18:41.532 --> 18:43.584
Here goes.

19:03.388 --> 19:06.189
- You know who I am, right?
- Oh, yeah.

19:06.224 --> 19:07.959
Take me in exchange for the hostages,

19:07.983 --> 19:09.717
and I'll help you get what you need.

19:13.699 --> 19:15.898
Come on!

19:18.069 --> 19:20.287
You need to talk to my boss.

19:22.324 --> 19:24.740
- See your hands.
- Tell me what you want.

19:24.742 --> 19:26.742
I'll release some hostages,

19:26.744 --> 19:29.578
but if you try
anything, people will die.

19:29.580 --> 19:31.538
The Black Badge Division has facilities

19:31.563 --> 19:33.273
outside the Ghost River Triangle,

19:33.301 --> 19:35.751
and if you harm one
hair on my deputy's head,

19:35.753 --> 19:38.137
I guarantee you a
fate much worse than death.

19:40.259 --> 19:42.092
Come on!

19:43.979 --> 19:46.012
What happened?

19:46.065 --> 19:49.432
- Shorty's hurt.
- Just my angina acting up.

19:49.484 --> 19:51.362
You go into a surplus store, you're

19:51.386 --> 19:53.210
bound to come across a few tools.

19:53.238 --> 19:55.355
The women and the clerk can go.

19:55.406 --> 19:56.772
Hey! Hey!

19:56.825 --> 19:59.276
I said it's me in
exchange for all the hostages.

19:59.327 --> 20:01.790
Yeah, well, we need three of you, so...

20:01.816 --> 20:02.635
For what?

20:02.664 --> 20:05.449
Come on.

20:07.001 --> 20:09.618
Oh, you're welcome! No
problem. Hey, tchk!

20:11.339 --> 20:13.039
Pfff!

20:18.797 --> 20:20.547
When they come back, we need to create

20:20.598 --> 20:23.133
a diversion. How do you
feel about flashing the twins?

20:23.134 --> 20:26.603
No, Marty! Please! No!

20:26.637 --> 20:28.689
What's the plan, Deputy Marshal?

20:28.723 --> 20:31.391
We surround the store. You
get a clear shot, let me know.

20:31.442 --> 20:33.477
- OK.
- We hear shots, we go in.

20:33.528 --> 20:36.645
Call Waverly. Tell her that
her sister's in a situation.

20:36.647 --> 20:39.482
OK. Isn't that Champ's truck?

20:39.535 --> 20:42.536
- Waverly's boyfriend?
- Unfortunately...

20:45.790 --> 20:47.907
Consider my plot vacated.

20:49.994 --> 20:52.128
It was never yours, hombre.

20:54.799 --> 20:56.477
Now, you weren't stupid enough to

20:56.501 --> 20:58.300
let yourself be followed, were you?

20:58.336 --> 21:02.172
Never. Now listen here, Bobo Del Rey.

21:02.173 --> 21:05.509
I found Killer Miller, I
dragged Levi across the line.

21:05.560 --> 21:07.894
But just so I don't feel like
I owe you anything else,

21:07.930 --> 21:10.980
I think it's best I put
some distance between us.

21:11.016 --> 21:13.517
Where are you gonna go?

21:13.568 --> 21:16.269
Anywhere under the stars.

21:16.320 --> 21:18.355
See, unlike your type,

21:18.406 --> 21:20.941
I can roam far and wide.

21:20.992 --> 21:24.243
Although from what I hear
around your little enclave,

21:24.278 --> 21:28.865
some of your cronies, oh, they're
itching to wander too.

21:33.704 --> 21:36.673
Well, they can try, but the
only way out of the Triangle

21:36.708 --> 21:38.541
is with me.

21:38.594 --> 21:40.710
Henry...

21:40.762 --> 21:43.630
I know you've been looking for her...

21:43.682 --> 21:46.549
been coming up a little... empty.

21:46.551 --> 21:49.051
Why, I don't know who you're...

21:49.054 --> 21:50.854
No, you don't know who.

21:50.888 --> 21:53.056
Stone Witch?

21:54.893 --> 21:56.692
There it is.

21:56.728 --> 21:59.980
Your instincts are
correct. She is close.

22:00.031 --> 22:03.650
And yes, she has
been giving some of my...

22:03.701 --> 22:06.952
weaker brethren some ideas of escape.

22:06.989 --> 22:09.071
But I have her name.

22:10.576 --> 22:12.541
- You give it to me.
- Just hold on now.

22:12.577 --> 22:14.544
The word is...

22:14.579 --> 22:16.880
Wynonna Earp's taken a shine to you.

22:16.914 --> 22:18.882
We can use that.

22:18.916 --> 22:21.884
You son of a bitch, I
do not work for you.

22:21.920 --> 22:24.887
You get the heir...

22:24.923 --> 22:27.590
to trust you. Have her think that, uh,

22:27.593 --> 22:30.477
you're on her side.

22:30.511 --> 22:33.846
Hell, once you get close to Wynonna,

22:33.898 --> 22:35.898
you'll be getting plenty on the side.

22:37.736 --> 22:39.769
Then, and only then...

22:41.772 --> 22:44.156
you'll get the name. But first...

22:47.278 --> 22:49.578
God, not now!

22:49.615 --> 22:52.449
Deal with that... or I will.

22:58.289 --> 23:01.124
You stupid girl.

23:04.429 --> 23:07.438
- Ow! Ow! Wrist burn!
- You want your friends to live,

23:07.439 --> 23:08.698
you're gonna do something for us.

23:08.699 --> 23:10.517
What the hell?!

23:15.523 --> 23:18.307
Easy, Marty. The witch chose
us three for a reason.

23:18.359 --> 23:21.778
Each of us guarding a
different piece of the puzzle!

23:21.813 --> 23:23.480
I knew about the hand, Gary hid

23:23.531 --> 23:26.066
the stupid book; now I
need you to get your piece!

23:26.117 --> 23:29.818
We didn't trust each
other and now look what I done!

23:29.872 --> 23:32.288
Put down the knife! The
heir's gonna help us!

23:32.324 --> 23:34.824
I do know the numbers.

23:34.876 --> 23:38.627
'Least, I did!

23:38.663 --> 23:41.664
You got your ass put
down by an Earp too, Gary!

23:41.666 --> 23:45.251
Sam and I waited 15 years

23:45.304 --> 23:48.837
for you to come back so you
could find the damn diary.

23:48.891 --> 23:51.340
So be quiet!

23:51.393 --> 23:53.809
- This seems to be going well.
- Shut up!

23:53.845 --> 23:55.845
You can kill us, right?

23:55.846 --> 23:58.515
Can you fix us? Bring Gary back.

23:58.517 --> 24:00.849
That's not how the curse works.

24:00.852 --> 24:02.852
I didn't put him
down with the Peacemaker.

24:02.854 --> 24:05.438
- He'll resurrect again soon.
- When?

24:05.490 --> 24:08.991
We don't have time for...
If you're not gonna help us,

24:09.027 --> 24:11.861
- I'm gonna...
- Wait! Wait!

24:11.913 --> 24:13.863
Krumper here dropped
this when I chased him

24:13.915 --> 24:15.865
through the cemetery.

24:15.917 --> 24:18.451
Not quite a combination, but
there are repeated sequences.

24:18.502 --> 24:22.288
So you're saying you can open it?

24:22.340 --> 24:23.967
Wouldn't be the first time I got

24:23.991 --> 24:25.566
all up in a 24-bolt Diebold.

24:28.713 --> 24:29.712
Marty!

24:35.354 --> 24:36.936
Put a muzzle on it.

24:48.317 --> 24:50.567
- Oh, hey, Henry.
- The hell were you doing

24:50.618 --> 24:52.568
- tailing me?
- I...

24:52.570 --> 24:54.903
What are you doing with Bobo Del Rey?

24:54.905 --> 24:56.655
None of your business!

24:56.708 --> 24:58.907
You don't know what he did to my family?

25:00.628 --> 25:03.546
You don't know what he is?

25:03.582 --> 25:06.915
Little girl, you do not know what I am.

25:08.553 --> 25:11.671
I know what you're supposed to be.

25:11.722 --> 25:13.722
You're supposed to be a hero.

25:15.394 --> 25:20.313
You're supposed to be Wyatt
Earp's best friend!

25:20.348 --> 25:23.266
You're supposed to be here to help us!

25:23.317 --> 25:25.101
Wavrrly Earp,

25:25.153 --> 25:28.688
you pull your head out of the past.

25:28.740 --> 25:30.690
You let it die, you change your name.

25:30.741 --> 25:32.692
You do whatever it takes

25:32.743 --> 25:34.693
to get through that
vapid brainpan of yours.

25:34.746 --> 25:37.329
Because if anybody is gonna clear

25:37.365 --> 25:39.281
the Earp name and pull this place

25:39.284 --> 25:41.451
out of misery...

25:41.452 --> 25:44.287
it sure as hell ain't gonna be

25:44.288 --> 25:47.539
the heir's pitiful, little sister!

25:51.462 --> 25:53.680
You forgot stupid...

25:53.714 --> 25:58.300
for thinking you're anything
more than just another a-hole.

26:09.030 --> 26:10.814
Ah!

26:10.865 --> 26:14.317
There. One more.

26:14.318 --> 26:16.952
I could guess the first two,
but the last one, not so much.

26:16.988 --> 26:18.821
- So you can't open it?!
- I'll kill her!

26:18.824 --> 26:20.656
Guys! I'm doing this

26:20.709 --> 26:24.126
the old-fashioned way
which requires silence.

26:24.162 --> 26:25.795
Looking at you, half-deck.

26:35.673 --> 26:37.840
Survey says...

26:45.067 --> 26:46.982
A little help, morons?

27:08.205 --> 27:10.789
It's here, Sam!

27:10.842 --> 27:13.375
Stan's two-timing wife's locket.

27:13.428 --> 27:16.679
- I did it!
- You're welcome.

27:16.714 --> 27:19.766
The loveless heart. Now, we leave.

27:19.800 --> 27:22.719
You're hooped, bro. Place is surrounded.

27:22.721 --> 27:24.887
Oh, we'll get through.

27:24.890 --> 27:27.390
Then we're gonna leave the
Ghost River Triangle forever.

27:27.392 --> 27:29.392
And you're coming with us.

27:33.291 --> 27:34.836
You have a shot.

27:34.837 --> 27:36.775
Jesus, Dolls, I've got a human shield.

27:36.890 --> 27:40.057
OK, I can offer safe
passage in return for the hostages.

27:40.109 --> 27:42.011
Here's our safe passage! Anyone with

27:42.037 --> 27:43.836
a badge follows us, they all die!

27:43.864 --> 27:46.230
Deputy, did they find what
they were looking for?

27:46.282 --> 27:48.282
Yeah. Loveless
heart. But don't sweat it,

27:48.317 --> 27:51.036
I'm gonna kill these sons of
bitches with my bare hands.

27:53.824 --> 27:56.657
Can I at least shoot
out the goddamned tires?

27:56.710 --> 27:59.160
Yeah, if you want
them to die now, go ahead.

28:00.963 --> 28:03.330
Tell Crazy Eyes not to hurt them.

28:03.383 --> 28:05.583
Not so tough without Wyatt's gun, eh?

28:05.635 --> 28:09.003
"With bare hands," that's cute.

28:09.006 --> 28:12.423
- We're just letting them go?
- No.

28:21.902 --> 28:23.902
You two, clear the scene.

28:43.589 --> 28:46.508
- Ah!
- Let's go!

28:46.542 --> 28:50.211
You really think you solved the
riddle, a way to break out?

28:50.262 --> 28:52.547
When my daddy wanted to scare us,

28:52.598 --> 28:54.798
he'd describe the brutal
things that happen to revenants

28:54.851 --> 28:57.969
if they try to escape the Triangle.

28:58.020 --> 29:01.722
- Ow!
- Bet he didn't do it justice,

29:01.775 --> 29:05.559
which is why we
went to all this trouble.

29:05.612 --> 29:07.561
The vessel.

29:07.614 --> 29:10.565
Right where she said it'd
be. Woman of her word.

29:10.567 --> 29:12.567
Who? Your girlfriend?

29:12.568 --> 29:14.234
Not with that
beard. Your mom. Definitely

29:14.237 --> 29:16.037
a mama's boy, right?

29:16.073 --> 29:18.873
I tried to be patient, like Bobo said,

29:18.909 --> 29:20.875
but if the heir puts
us down, where are we?

29:20.911 --> 29:23.461
Back in Hell again.
You know Marty here's

29:23.497 --> 29:25.997
been put down three times?

29:26.048 --> 29:28.549
Third-generation revenant?

29:28.585 --> 29:31.086
Three times down south, you'd
go a little psychotic too.

29:31.087 --> 29:32.720
So if we owe the Stone Witch big

29:32.744 --> 29:34.556
time in exchange for safe passage

29:34.590 --> 29:38.393
across the boundary,
I can live with that.

29:38.427 --> 29:40.260
Stone Witch?

29:59.782 --> 30:01.449
They're gonna sacrifice us.

30:01.451 --> 30:05.202
- They're gonna eat us.
- We won't let that happen.

30:05.255 --> 30:08.123
I just need to get my gun back.

30:08.125 --> 30:10.424
Come on, Dolls.

30:15.015 --> 30:17.382
- Oh no!
- Shorty!

30:17.433 --> 30:19.968
They got me, Wynonna.

30:19.970 --> 30:22.720
You do not give up, do you hear me?

30:22.772 --> 30:25.056
Your uncle Curtis was right.

30:25.107 --> 30:28.308
Always talking about the monsters

30:28.310 --> 30:30.644
among us when he'd had a few.

30:30.646 --> 30:33.448
There's always been
something unnatural about this place.

30:33.482 --> 30:35.817
Still, I'll miss it.

30:38.989 --> 30:40.622
Don't try anything!

30:40.656 --> 30:43.290
If I do, it'll be the
last thing you ever see.

30:43.326 --> 30:44.875
Sit!

30:58.674 --> 31:02.509
- Can I finish him up?
- I told you, no!

31:02.511 --> 31:04.645
You need him!

31:06.348 --> 31:10.268
No way! I called dibs
on the big roughrider!

31:10.319 --> 31:13.605
You have the...

31:13.656 --> 31:17.491
Ugh, saved my last bullet

31:17.527 --> 31:22.363
for him. Been waiting to
do that for a long time.

31:22.414 --> 31:24.865
- So have I.
- The old man's not gonna

31:24.867 --> 31:28.336
make it. Cowboy's the
only good one left.

31:28.371 --> 31:30.505
That's why you need Champ's body?

31:30.539 --> 31:33.340
For some sort of, like, possession?

31:33.375 --> 31:36.711
What? In my body?! Wynonna, I
don't even put gluten in this!

31:36.762 --> 31:39.547
Then you can walk
across the line in human form.

31:39.548 --> 31:43.384
When I'm finally free of this place...

31:43.435 --> 31:45.385
you know what I'm gonna do to the first

31:45.438 --> 31:48.222
perfect family I come across? Hm?

31:48.224 --> 31:50.224
It involves power tools,

31:50.227 --> 31:52.977
pain...

31:53.028 --> 31:55.195
and days of pleading.

31:55.231 --> 31:57.065
But it'll be

31:57.067 --> 31:59.483
nothing compared to what I'll do

31:59.536 --> 32:01.903
to the second or the third...

32:01.954 --> 32:04.239
- I got it.
- Then you stay put

32:04.240 --> 32:06.240
or I'll kill you next.

32:12.915 --> 32:14.965
Let every bond be loosened,

32:15.000 --> 32:18.336
every force fail. Let all walls crumble.

32:18.387 --> 32:20.587
Take me.

32:20.640 --> 32:23.423
Leave the others. Think about it.

32:23.425 --> 32:25.926
You can walk out of here,

32:25.979 --> 32:28.762
break the curse, get your
freedom in the Earp heir.

32:28.765 --> 32:32.599
Wouldn't that be payback?

32:32.602 --> 32:36.604
- For I am a servant of stone.
- Take me!

32:36.605 --> 32:39.156
Every bond be
weakened, every force fail.

32:40.943 --> 32:43.111
I don't think I can
save us all. Run. Now.

32:45.915 --> 32:49.534
- Just me or...?
- For Waverly. Go!

32:49.586 --> 32:51.536
- You go too.
- Shorty,

32:51.587 --> 32:54.122
if these monsters escape, I'm
the only one who can stop them.

32:55.959 --> 32:58.792
I always told Gus and your
sister you'd come back.

33:00.462 --> 33:02.297
Go on, Champ.

33:04.800 --> 33:07.384
- I'll get help, I swear.
- OK.

33:07.436 --> 33:08.635
OK.

33:08.637 --> 33:11.556
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo!

33:11.607 --> 33:15.309
The Stone Witch kept her
word! Where's the young one?

33:15.362 --> 33:16.778
Where's...?

33:33.380 --> 33:35.829
OK, I got this.

33:35.882 --> 33:38.583
Fight him once he's inside me.

33:38.634 --> 33:41.674
This is not the kind of
penetration I'm used to.

33:43.153 --> 33:45.313
Shorty, if this thing gets inside of me,

33:45.314 --> 33:47.786
tell Dolls to shoot me. Fast.

33:47.837 --> 33:49.837
They're wrong.

33:49.839 --> 33:51.839
You're a good girl, Wynonna.

33:51.842 --> 33:53.976
No!

33:55.980 --> 33:58.396
Ah! Ugh!

34:00.101 --> 34:02.017
Shorty? Hey!

34:10.827 --> 34:14.163
What the hell?! I'm in the dying one?!

34:14.197 --> 34:16.998
What's the point of possession if I...

34:17.034 --> 34:20.369
Gah! Damn that witch!

34:20.402 --> 34:22.907
Sam? That's you in there, right?

34:23.030 --> 34:25.289
You know you're gonna die even
if you make it across the line.

34:25.342 --> 34:28.126
Witch got me in one body, maybe
she'll find me another.

34:28.179 --> 34:31.012
What makes you think she won't kill you?

34:31.047 --> 34:33.097
It's worth the risk. Give
me straight up death

34:33.134 --> 34:35.601
over being sent to
Hell and back over and over.

34:37.605 --> 34:40.389
And she's my ride.

34:42.559 --> 34:45.443
She told me to get
backup. Where's everybody else?

34:45.478 --> 34:47.445
I-I-I should go back.

34:47.481 --> 34:49.447
I'm all the backup she needs.

34:49.483 --> 34:50.949
Now run!

34:52.652 --> 34:55.237
Ok, Ok.

34:59.242 --> 35:01.242
Hey! Stop!

35:05.715 --> 35:07.583
I tried not to

35:07.585 --> 35:10.418
kill you.

35:10.420 --> 35:12.420
I thought it was crueller

35:12.422 --> 35:15.641
to make you watch me escape.

35:15.675 --> 35:18.427
But if you insist...

35:18.429 --> 35:20.262
Shorty...

35:20.264 --> 35:22.264
Shorty, if you're in there,

35:22.266 --> 35:24.266
don't let him do this.

35:24.268 --> 35:26.818
Shorty ain't here, bitch.

35:43.286 --> 35:45.420
Grrr! Ugh!

35:48.175 --> 35:50.626
Tell me that was your plan all along.

36:12.398 --> 36:15.284
He's not there. The
revenant's in your friend.

36:15.318 --> 36:17.735
Look, there's no other way.

36:17.788 --> 36:20.621
Bullshit. We can still save
him, reverse the spell.

36:20.657 --> 36:22.958
- Come on, Wynonna.
- There has to be a way.

36:25.411 --> 36:27.829
Robert "Shorty" Simons, you
halt your ass right there.

36:27.831 --> 36:29.581
Wynonna?

36:29.632 --> 36:33.085
Shorty, fight it! Fight it!

36:33.137 --> 36:35.336
It hurts, it burns.

36:35.389 --> 36:38.507
Do it, please.

36:38.559 --> 36:40.509
I can hear his
thoughts, everything he did.

36:40.510 --> 36:43.010
Shut up, old man!

36:43.063 --> 36:45.847
You have to stop him, Wynonna.

36:45.900 --> 36:48.016
He's a monster.

36:48.018 --> 36:50.101
We're the monster now, Shorty.

36:50.153 --> 36:52.688
They didn't kill your sister,

36:52.739 --> 36:56.240
not at first.

36:56.277 --> 36:58.242
He says Willa

36:58.278 --> 37:00.695
screamed for days!

37:25.025 --> 37:27.097
Waverly.

37:27.527 --> 37:29.360
I'm so sorry.

37:34.284 --> 37:36.485
Oh, it's ok.

37:36.536 --> 37:38.619
Hey, um... OK.

37:42.242 --> 37:45.661
Hey, uh, I got your voicemail.

37:45.713 --> 37:49.248
- Yeah.
- About Wynonna. Thanks.

37:49.250 --> 37:51.750
- Thank you.
- That was really sweet.

37:51.751 --> 37:55.086
Yeah, sure.

37:55.088 --> 37:56.588
Of course.

38:00.260 --> 38:03.478
I don't know, something about
her rubs me the wrong way.

38:03.514 --> 38:07.398
Miss Officer what's-her-name.

38:07.434 --> 38:11.068
- It's Haught.
- Ah...

38:11.105 --> 38:14.021
She's... She...

38:14.074 --> 38:16.742
Oh, baby, baby,
baby, it's OK. Don't cry.

38:16.777 --> 38:18.994
Don't cry, it's ok. I'm ok.

38:19.028 --> 38:22.280
Right? Wynonna and I were almost

38:22.282 --> 38:24.449
human sacrificed. Shorty saved us.

38:24.451 --> 38:26.751
- Yeah...
- Yeah.

38:26.786 --> 38:30.172
- It's ok.
- Yeah, uh...

38:30.206 --> 38:33.958
Dolls says that, uh, they were, uh,

38:34.010 --> 38:36.128
brainwashed by some kind of cult.

38:36.179 --> 38:37.679
Yeah.

38:37.715 --> 38:40.599
And Wynonna tells me
you were really brave.

38:40.634 --> 38:42.434
I was.

38:42.469 --> 38:46.387
One thing's for sure: I'm
never leaving your side again. OK?

38:46.440 --> 38:53.978
Oh, come on.

38:53.981 --> 38:57.365
Hey, uh, any update on
that time capsule murder?

38:57.400 --> 38:59.784
Nedley knows I won't tell him, huh?

38:59.820 --> 39:02.704
It's unresolved. We're
handing the case back over to metro.

39:02.739 --> 39:04.360
Any connection to the kidnapping?

39:04.362 --> 39:05.978
- None.
- Poor Shorty.

39:06.114 --> 39:08.242
Yeah. We have his body, we're
doing a full autopsy,

39:08.295 --> 39:10.579
but our best guess is the
stress of the ordeal

39:10.630 --> 39:12.998
was too much for his heart condition.

39:15.135 --> 39:17.335
She said she was glad I called.

39:17.338 --> 39:19.670
I'll bet.

39:22.675 --> 39:26.094
You know, maybe I could have helped.

39:26.146 --> 39:27.846
You know, like, really helped.

39:27.847 --> 39:29.847
Out there with you guys

39:29.900 --> 39:32.016
as a team.

39:32.068 --> 39:35.186
That's not our deal, Wav.

39:35.188 --> 39:37.188
Some team...

39:37.190 --> 39:39.190
Not even sure we're the good guys.

39:39.193 --> 39:42.443
Well, good guys seem to be

39:42.496 --> 39:45.831
in short supply these days.

39:45.865 --> 39:48.032
Believe me...

39:48.085 --> 39:50.202
you are definitely one of them.

39:59.762 --> 40:02.380
It's tough, but it'll pass.

40:02.382 --> 40:04.382
Great pep talk.

40:04.434 --> 40:06.518
Shorty's dead, Revenants can

40:06.552 --> 40:09.721
body snatch people, and we
don't know how to ID them.

40:09.773 --> 40:11.722
Not to mention, there's
a witch out there

40:11.775 --> 40:14.643
toying with Revenants
via high-risk spells.

40:14.695 --> 40:17.195
- At least it didn't work.
- Doesn't mean they won't

40:17.231 --> 40:20.565
try it again though, right?

40:20.617 --> 40:24.369
Found the tracker you
stuck behind my ear.

40:24.405 --> 40:27.405
- The hell took you so long?
- I was always there.

40:27.458 --> 40:30.826
But I just needed to see if
they could actually do it.

40:30.878 --> 40:33.878
Even if it meant Shorty had to die?

40:33.914 --> 40:35.880
- Collateral damage.
- Ha!

40:35.916 --> 40:38.416
This is a war. You want
to avenge your sister

40:38.469 --> 40:41.753
and your dad, right? And
this is what victories

40:41.804 --> 40:43.755
- might have to look like.
- And what about our failures?

40:43.806 --> 40:46.307
Wynonna...

40:46.342 --> 40:48.309
- Wow...
- Yeah.

40:49.980 --> 40:53.981
With all the shit I've
done in my life...

40:54.018 --> 40:57.568
Dolls, working with you...

40:57.603 --> 41:00.237
I don't think I can look in the mirror.

41:08.282 --> 41:11.199
Oh, please, make yourself at home.

41:11.251 --> 41:13.284
I did not know the man well,

41:13.286 --> 41:16.288
but no barkeep has ever
made a better Mule Skinner.

41:16.289 --> 41:18.123
Shorty was my friend.

41:18.175 --> 41:20.125
About the only friend I had around here.

41:20.177 --> 41:22.126
Well, I could be a friend

41:22.128 --> 41:24.045
and, who knows, maybe in time,

41:24.097 --> 41:26.597
- maybe a trusted confidante...
- Listen, "Hank".

41:26.632 --> 41:28.967
I've had a supremely shitty day.

41:29.018 --> 41:31.018
There was an old saying,

41:31.054 --> 41:33.771
"Quiet ponies never
made for skilled riders."

41:33.806 --> 41:36.557
I frigging hate horses.

41:36.610 --> 41:39.061
You have seen a lot of
strange things in Purgatory,

41:39.112 --> 41:41.228
unnatural things,

41:41.280 --> 41:44.483
so I do hope your mind is open.

41:44.534 --> 41:47.152
Look, if you're about
to propose a threesome,

41:47.204 --> 41:49.153
I'm tired and I haven't shaved my legs.

41:49.206 --> 41:50.989
No.

41:51.041 --> 41:53.375
Henry?

41:55.963 --> 41:59.664
The fact is, I have not properly
introduced myself.

41:59.717 --> 42:03.135
You can tell your sister she is right.

42:03.170 --> 42:08.090
I am... was... friends with
your great-great-grandpappy.

42:08.141 --> 42:11.175
My name is John Henry,

42:11.228 --> 42:15.012
but most people just called me Doc.

42:17.317 --> 42:19.518
"Doc"?

42:19.570 --> 42:21.519
Doc Holliday?

42:23.606 --> 42:25.606
Wynonna Earp...

42:28.579 --> 42:30.862
I am at your disposal.

42:34.168 --> 42:35.590
Well, shit.
