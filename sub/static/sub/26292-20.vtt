WEBVTT

00:01.200 --> 00:03.200
Mom!

00:03.719 --> 00:04.785
Mom?

00:06.723 --> 00:09.076
Next Tuesday's fine.

00:09.726 --> 00:10.726
- Let's do that.
- Yeah.

00:10.760 --> 00:12.695
Keep him on the leash, honey.

00:12.729 --> 00:13.914
Thank you.

00:14.664 --> 00:16.082
Mom!

00:17.567 --> 00:18.867
Mom?

00:18.902 --> 00:20.769
Mom!

00:23.807 --> 00:25.307
It's okay, honey.

00:25.342 --> 00:27.876
It's okay. How can I help?

00:27.911 --> 00:30.157
I can't find my mom.

00:30.158 --> 00:32.159
- I don't know where she went.
- It's okay.

00:32.192 --> 00:33.794
We'll find her. What's your name?

00:33.828 --> 00:35.758
- Luna.
- Luna.

00:35.792 --> 00:37.197
That's a pretty name.

00:37.232 --> 00:40.000
What about your dad?
Do you know where he is?

00:40.399 --> 00:41.969
I don't have a dad.

00:42.003 --> 00:43.971
My dad died.

02:06.794 --> 02:09.122
All right, I've got two infinity pools,

02:09.157 --> 02:11.392
I got a swim-up Jacuzzi, and this?

02:11.426 --> 02:13.293
This is where
the Millennium Falcon lands.

02:13.328 --> 02:15.663
So...

02:15.697 --> 02:16.964
What?

02:16.998 --> 02:18.411
No, Jeffery, it's, uh... it's great.

02:18.446 --> 02:20.885
It's just, it's safe to say
you followed the letter

02:20.919 --> 02:24.138
of the exercise
and perhaps not the spirit.

02:24.172 --> 02:26.106
I mean, you said
envision our futures, right?

02:26.141 --> 02:28.108
- Well, y'all, this is mine.
- Yes, Jeffery.

02:28.143 --> 02:30.444
It's just, your future contains
a few more

02:30.478 --> 02:32.446
two-piece bathing suits
than I had anticipated.

02:32.480 --> 02:34.081
That's all.

02:34.115 --> 02:35.282
Can... can I go next, Dr. Frome?

02:35.316 --> 02:36.412
Yes, Avi, please.

02:36.446 --> 02:37.618
Talk us through your vision
of your future.

02:37.652 --> 02:39.296
Jeffery, it's fantastic.

02:39.331 --> 02:41.255
Thanks.

02:41.289 --> 02:45.359
Okay, so right here
is Parthenon in Athens.

02:45.393 --> 02:48.262
I'm gonna go after I learn
some Greek, you know?

02:48.296 --> 02:49.363
So I can speak to the locals.

02:49.397 --> 02:51.510
I hate that everybody
just assume that everybody's

02:51.544 --> 02:52.831
just gonna speak English, you know?

02:52.865 --> 02:53.967
That's smart.

02:54.002 --> 02:55.269
And this?

02:55.303 --> 02:57.705
This is Table Mountain in Cape Town.

02:57.739 --> 03:01.175
One day I'm gonna hike it.

03:01.209 --> 03:03.010
Right to the top.

03:03.044 --> 03:04.712
What drew you to Cape Town?

03:05.127 --> 03:09.049
I guess I just, you know,
want to see the world.

03:09.423 --> 03:11.118
Go places I never been before.

03:11.152 --> 03:13.385
I mean, come on. Look at that view.

03:14.322 --> 03:16.156
- That's spectacular.
- It's beautiful.

03:16.191 --> 03:18.692
It is, Avi. Fantastic, truly.

03:18.727 --> 03:21.028
Now, guys, it is more than fine

03:21.062 --> 03:22.362
to look forward to material things...

03:22.397 --> 03:24.364
- Yeah.
- Yes.

03:24.399 --> 03:27.167
But... but sometimes

03:27.202 --> 03:29.636
goals are stronger
when they affect who we are.

03:29.671 --> 03:31.505
You know what I mean?

03:31.539 --> 03:33.040
- Iggy.
- Yes.

03:33.074 --> 03:35.175
- You have a visitor.
- Ah.

03:35.210 --> 03:36.543
It's my new Jet Ski.

03:36.578 --> 03:39.567
Um, guys, keep filling out
your vision boards.

03:39.601 --> 03:40.667
I will be right back.

03:40.701 --> 03:42.613
And Jeffrey, ease off
the swimsuit models.

03:42.647 --> 03:44.969
Thank you.

03:45.003 --> 03:46.086
Hi.

03:46.121 --> 03:49.156
Tiara Dobbs. Avi Mantell's social worker.

03:49.190 --> 03:50.591
It's good to finally meet you in person.

03:50.625 --> 03:52.326
Yeah, likewise.

03:52.360 --> 03:54.561
So, um, what brings you down
to our neck of the woods today?

03:54.596 --> 03:57.264
Avi's mother's been offered
a job in Missouri...

03:57.298 --> 04:00.434
her hometown... and she can't pass it up,

04:00.468 --> 04:02.169
so she's gonna be
moving back there next week.

04:02.203 --> 04:03.604
Oh, wow.

04:03.638 --> 04:06.106
With Avi, obviously.

04:06.141 --> 04:07.341
Yes.

04:07.375 --> 04:08.709
I reviewed Avi's case and it appears

04:08.743 --> 04:11.411
that he has made huge strides with you,

04:11.446 --> 04:13.714
so I can't think of any reason
that he can't transfer

04:13.748 --> 04:16.083
from inpatient care to weekly visits

04:16.117 --> 04:17.416
with a local therapist.

04:17.452 --> 04:19.685
I just need you to sign off

04:19.721 --> 04:24.191
so I can begin Avi's
official discharge procedure.

04:25.760 --> 04:28.395
Unless you don't agree.

04:28.429 --> 04:30.798
I did... I did have...

04:30.832 --> 04:33.400
a pretty huge breakthrough
with him recently.

04:33.434 --> 04:35.035
Well, that's certainly good to hear.

04:35.069 --> 04:36.551
I know, it is.

04:37.305 --> 04:39.963
Yes, I think that Avi
is ready for the next step.

04:39.998 --> 04:41.831
- Wonderful.
- Okay.

04:41.865 --> 04:44.545
I'll tell Avi to pack his things.

04:44.579 --> 04:47.381
What is so funny?

04:47.415 --> 04:48.549
I've just discovered

04:48.583 --> 04:50.651
that New Amsterdam has a listing on Yelp.

04:50.685 --> 04:51.685
"Yelp"?

04:51.719 --> 04:53.453
Yeah, you know, where people
post online reviews

04:53.488 --> 04:55.222
about places they love, things they hate,

04:55.256 --> 04:56.089
their experiences.

04:56.124 --> 04:59.259
Oh, like Facebook but on the internet.

04:59.294 --> 05:00.394
Uh...

05:00.428 --> 05:01.486
Yes, exactly.

05:01.521 --> 05:04.298
Listen to this:
it was posted two minutes ago

05:04.332 --> 05:06.300
by @NancyPants.

05:06.334 --> 05:08.669
"The rooms at New Amsterdam are freezing,

05:08.703 --> 05:10.571
"the lights are horrifically bright,

05:10.605 --> 05:12.439
"and the only thing older
than this mattress

05:12.473 --> 05:13.807
"is my bald doctor who can never seem

05:13.842 --> 05:15.108
"to find his glasses.

05:15.143 --> 05:16.777
One star."

05:16.811 --> 05:18.612
Let me see this.

05:20.381 --> 05:22.249
I know this patient.

05:22.283 --> 05:24.518
This is Nancy Nan.

05:24.552 --> 05:26.119
She's doing a sleep study with me.

05:26.154 --> 05:28.077
One star, Vijay.

05:28.111 --> 05:29.756
- Ouch.
- One star?

05:29.791 --> 05:32.125
That's absurd.
All she has to do is to sleep.

05:32.160 --> 05:34.294
I'm joking. Don't worry about it.

05:35.363 --> 05:36.597
40-plus years of practice

05:36.631 --> 05:38.632
and an expert in my field of study.

05:38.666 --> 05:41.802
I should be able
to do better than one star.

05:41.836 --> 05:44.165
- We shall see about this.
- Uh, Vijay.

05:44.199 --> 05:47.207
My phone and your glasses.

05:47.242 --> 05:48.475
Yeah.

05:57.218 --> 05:59.386
Nice cap, Williamsburg.

05:59.420 --> 06:01.288
When does your artisan
pickle shop open up?

06:01.322 --> 06:04.291
- Proud of that one?
- Mm, I'm proud of all of them.

06:04.325 --> 06:07.361
So, today's schedule isn't too terrible.

06:07.395 --> 06:10.117
Fist up: Quarterly Allocation
Review Committee.

06:10.152 --> 06:11.698
- Pass.
- Uh, you can't really pass.

06:11.733 --> 06:13.700
No? Watch me. I'm skipping
that redundant meeting.

06:13.735 --> 06:14.937
What's next?

06:14.972 --> 06:17.304
Then there's a new
pharma vendor show-and-tell.

06:17.338 --> 06:20.038
- Pass.
- You... okay.

06:20.073 --> 06:22.209
Uh, the Board requested your presence

06:22.243 --> 06:24.311
at the Strategic Objective
Luncheon in midtown.

06:24.345 --> 06:26.179
- Pass. Next?
- Max...

06:26.214 --> 06:27.681
Pass. Next?

06:27.715 --> 06:29.093
Police commissioner called again.

06:29.127 --> 06:30.484
I'm guessing it has to do
with what happened

06:30.518 --> 06:31.551
to Officer McNeil.

06:31.586 --> 06:33.043
Yeah, hard pass.

06:33.855 --> 06:35.136
- Max.
- No.

06:35.171 --> 06:36.857
There's not a single essential
meeting on that entire list.

06:36.891 --> 06:38.825
They're all just arbitrary,

06:38.860 --> 06:42.229
and I'm not wasting
any more time on arbitrary.

06:42.263 --> 06:44.831
Well, what...
well, now that you've cleared

06:44.866 --> 06:46.433
your entire schedule,
what do you intend to do...

06:46.467 --> 06:47.901
I don't know, something that matters.

06:47.936 --> 06:49.569
You know, something worth my time.

06:49.604 --> 06:51.705
Maybe something life and death.

06:56.544 --> 06:58.245
What was that all about?

06:58.279 --> 06:59.947
He's in a mood.

07:01.316 --> 07:02.883
It's okay, honey.

07:02.917 --> 07:05.652
Whoa, whoa!

07:06.621 --> 07:08.522
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

07:10.205 --> 07:12.259
What the hell happened in here?

07:12.293 --> 07:14.628
You might want to ask him.

07:17.265 --> 07:18.732
Okay, I got this.

07:18.766 --> 07:21.248
- It just came out of nowhere.
- It's okay.

07:21.282 --> 07:23.236
All right, let's go.

07:30.778 --> 07:32.946
That was your vision board, bud.

07:32.981 --> 07:35.582
- What's going on?
- I'm not going nowhere!

07:35.616 --> 07:37.107
Avi...

07:37.819 --> 07:39.653
You're gonna do great today.

07:39.687 --> 07:42.556
I've been to plenty of morbidity
and mortality conferences.

07:42.590 --> 07:44.101
Just never had to lead one.

07:44.135 --> 07:46.259
Well, you're my, uh, chief resident now.

07:46.294 --> 07:48.118
It comes with the job title.

07:49.035 --> 07:51.071
Been going over your case
and it sounded just awful.

07:51.106 --> 07:53.633
Officer McNeil just bled out so fast.

07:53.668 --> 07:55.602
Yes.

07:55.636 --> 07:57.637
I'm sorry, Dr. Reynolds.

07:57.672 --> 07:59.639
So am I.

07:59.835 --> 08:01.736
Look, I just want you to know
I'm not gonna throw you

08:01.770 --> 08:03.070
under the bus or anything
during this discussion.

08:03.105 --> 08:05.773
No, no, no. Look, M&Ms
aren't about blame, all right?

08:05.807 --> 08:06.807
They're a teaching tool.

08:06.842 --> 08:08.976
We come together to see
if our actions contributed

08:09.011 --> 08:11.412
to the patient's death so we
never repeat those mistakes.

08:11.446 --> 08:12.480
But that's just the thing.

08:12.514 --> 08:13.915
I've been preparing this for days.

08:13.949 --> 08:15.082
I haven't found any mistakes.

08:15.117 --> 08:16.751
Hey, that can happen too, all right?

08:16.785 --> 08:17.985
But we still study the case

08:18.020 --> 08:19.654
and we vow to do better the next time.

08:19.688 --> 08:20.761
That's it.

08:20.795 --> 08:23.463
Today's case is a white
40-year-old female

08:23.498 --> 08:24.825
trauma patient.

08:24.860 --> 08:26.727
She initially presented with...

08:32.453 --> 08:33.788
Go ahead.

08:36.499 --> 08:38.940
The patient presented
with a fractured femur,

08:38.974 --> 08:40.808
cervical and thoracic abrasions...

08:40.842 --> 08:43.811
Was Officer McNeil on any medications?

08:47.683 --> 08:49.387
She was on...

08:49.885 --> 08:51.681
low-dose birth control.

08:53.822 --> 08:55.856
25 minutes post arrival...

08:55.891 --> 08:58.188
Did Officer McNeil have
a history of heart disease?

08:59.661 --> 09:01.162
Uh...

09:02.497 --> 09:04.131
No, the patient did not.

09:04.166 --> 09:07.168
We all know you're talking about
Officer McNeil, Dr. Nottingham.

09:07.202 --> 09:08.782
No need for anonymity.

09:09.571 --> 09:10.871
Okay.

09:10.906 --> 09:12.807
Um...

09:12.841 --> 09:15.843
25 minutes post arrival,
Officer McNeil developed

09:15.877 --> 09:17.979
a pneumomediastinum, necessitating...

09:18.013 --> 09:20.548
Before the pneumomediastinum,
were there any other signs

09:20.582 --> 09:23.150
in her vitals that could have
predicted her eventual death?

09:23.185 --> 09:25.052
- Not that I'm aware of.
- Hmm.

09:25.087 --> 09:26.520
What did Officer McNeil look like

09:26.555 --> 09:28.089
as she went into surgery?

09:28.123 --> 09:30.157
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

09:33.528 --> 09:35.229
I wasn't there.

09:35.264 --> 09:36.935
You weren't there.

09:38.533 --> 09:41.235
Well, if we have any hope of
getting some real answers today

09:41.270 --> 09:44.105
then we need someone presenting this case

09:44.139 --> 09:47.275
who was actually there.

09:50.946 --> 09:52.880
Dr. Reynolds?

09:52.914 --> 09:55.683
She was your patient, right?

09:57.819 --> 09:59.887
- Yes, she was.
- Hmm.

09:59.921 --> 10:01.589
So you would have
the most salient information

10:01.623 --> 10:03.090
on this case.

10:03.125 --> 10:05.672
I think Nottingham is providing
an accurate case review.

10:06.728 --> 10:09.096
Hmm. Indeed.

10:09.131 --> 10:11.766
But, uh, to really get
to the bottom of how she died,

10:11.800 --> 10:14.602
don't you think that
you might be better qualified

10:14.636 --> 10:16.808
to lead this discussion?

10:17.773 --> 10:19.874
If it's not too much trouble.

10:26.082 --> 10:27.381
- Next slide.
- Okay.

10:27.415 --> 10:29.581
Let's go to the chest x-ray first.

10:29.616 --> 10:30.651
Okay, good.

10:30.685 --> 10:31.852
- Next slide.
- Okay.

10:31.886 --> 10:34.321
All right.

10:35.034 --> 10:37.904
So here we have
Marie McNeil's chest x-ray.

10:37.929 --> 10:39.597
You will notice the mediastinum.

10:39.631 --> 10:41.999
It measured just over
9 centimeters in length.

10:42.033 --> 10:44.802
Now, Dr. Nottingham,
can you give us the criteria

10:44.836 --> 10:46.065
for pathological widening?

10:46.099 --> 10:48.105
8 centimeters on a supine AP chest.

10:48.139 --> 10:49.173
Very good.

10:49.207 --> 10:51.327
We have met the criteria
for pathological widening.

10:51.361 --> 10:54.512
If we take a closer look
right about here... see that?

10:54.546 --> 10:55.928
Air bubbles.

10:55.962 --> 10:58.782
That's the cause
for the widened mediastinum.

10:58.817 --> 11:01.485
Now, that's actually caused
by tears in the esophagus

11:01.520 --> 11:04.021
called Boerhaave's syndrome, all right?

11:04.055 --> 11:05.823
And also of note:

11:05.857 --> 11:08.592
normal pulmonary parenchyma

11:08.627 --> 11:10.594
and normal cardiac silhouette.

11:10.629 --> 11:11.946
Next.

11:13.465 --> 11:15.783
Uh, wait, go back to the chest x-ray.

11:17.725 --> 11:20.371
You said cardiac silhouette was normal?

11:21.072 --> 11:22.457
Yes.

11:23.842 --> 11:26.477
But the chest x-ray
is a rather blunt instrument

11:26.511 --> 11:28.712
for examining something
as delicate as the human heart,

11:28.747 --> 11:30.147
wouldn't you say?

11:30.181 --> 11:32.508
So what other modalities did you use?

11:33.885 --> 11:36.453
An EKG and
a transthoracic echocardiogram,

11:36.488 --> 11:37.788
both of which came back normal.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.957
Good. Can we see those?

11:45.163 --> 11:46.730
Uh, Dr. Nottingham didn't include them

11:46.765 --> 11:49.733
in today's presentation
because they were normal.

11:49.768 --> 11:51.702
Well, I can't tell if they were normal

11:51.736 --> 11:54.371
if I can't see them for myself.

11:54.406 --> 11:56.874
Well, I don't have them here.

11:56.908 --> 11:58.112
No?

12:00.946 --> 12:04.081
The entire purpose of an M&M
is to analyze the data

12:04.115 --> 12:06.684
to ensure that if mistakes were made

12:06.718 --> 12:08.586
those mistakes will not be made again.

12:08.620 --> 12:10.654
It is particularly difficult
to analyze that data

12:10.689 --> 12:12.890
when that data isn't here.

12:12.924 --> 12:14.892
So why don't we take a brief recess

12:14.926 --> 12:16.560
to allow Dr. Reynolds to compile

12:16.595 --> 12:20.664
all the necessary cardiac data.

12:29.474 --> 12:32.876
Uh, why are you moving me?

12:32.911 --> 12:34.678
I honestly have no idea.

12:34.713 --> 12:36.847
To get better results on your sleep study

12:36.881 --> 12:39.683
we wish for you
to, uh, have a warmer room

12:39.718 --> 12:43.087
with better lighting
and much, much softer bed.

12:43.121 --> 12:44.755
Okay.

12:44.789 --> 12:46.123
- Oh!
- Uh, hello.

12:46.157 --> 12:47.482
What's up with the lamp?

12:47.516 --> 12:50.094
Uh, we're moving this patient
to a nicer room

12:50.128 --> 12:52.529
for some random reason.

12:52.564 --> 12:54.465
- What?
- No.

12:54.499 --> 12:56.500
We have a reason. The reason
is because we are trying

12:56.534 --> 12:59.770
to provide Ms. Nan with
the most comfortable care here

12:59.804 --> 13:02.640
in the New Amsterdam
because patient comes first.

13:02.674 --> 13:04.017
Right?

13:04.643 --> 13:05.776
Yes.

13:05.810 --> 13:07.478
Yes.

13:07.512 --> 13:09.780
Finally, someone who gets it. Thank you.

13:09.814 --> 13:11.215
- You are welcome.
- Yeah.

13:11.249 --> 13:13.117
We gotta go the extra mile, you know?

13:13.151 --> 13:14.585
Our patients do come first.

13:14.619 --> 13:16.120
I mean, this is what I've been saying.

13:16.154 --> 13:17.788
You know, these people
depend on us for care.

13:17.822 --> 13:19.923
They put their very lives in our hands.

13:20.450 --> 13:22.993
My boyfriend just hates my snoring.

13:23.028 --> 13:24.628
You know, we can do better.

13:24.663 --> 13:26.063
We can do better than just provide her

13:26.097 --> 13:27.985
- with comfortable care.
- We can?

13:28.010 --> 13:31.836
Yeah. How would Ms. Nan like a
stay in our Presidential Suite?

13:32.303 --> 13:35.646
I imagine she would like that very much.

13:35.680 --> 13:37.141
- Yes, thank you.
- Mm, good.

13:37.175 --> 13:38.609
Okay.

13:38.643 --> 13:40.944
Come on, before he changes his mind.

13:42.714 --> 13:44.615
Hurry up.

13:51.289 --> 13:53.524
Why does she have to be here?

13:54.292 --> 13:57.494
Uh, Ms. Dobbs and I are both
your advocates, Avi.

13:57.529 --> 13:59.830
- She's part of the team.
- I don't have a team.

13:59.864 --> 14:01.298
You don't. You have an entire network.

14:01.332 --> 14:03.100
Me, Ms. Dobbs, your mother.

14:03.134 --> 14:05.502
The All Stars, man, you know?

14:05.537 --> 14:07.004
Everyone wants to see your transition

14:07.038 --> 14:08.772
to life outside
of the hospital go smoothly.

14:08.807 --> 14:10.507
Too big of a freak
to be in the real world

14:10.542 --> 14:11.608
with normal people.

14:11.643 --> 14:13.351
What is... what are you doing?
Time out, time out.

14:13.385 --> 14:16.602
You know full well on this ward
we don't use words like freak.

14:16.636 --> 14:19.016
"Real world," "normal"...
whatever that is.

14:19.050 --> 14:21.985
All right? Those are
day-one ground rules, Avi.

14:22.020 --> 14:23.387
Come on.

14:27.158 --> 14:29.860
I think you're breaking
the rules on purpose.

14:29.894 --> 14:31.187
That's my theory.

14:32.664 --> 14:34.298
I think you're scared of what's to come.

14:34.332 --> 14:35.599
You're scared of these changes,

14:35.633 --> 14:37.868
so you think if you act out now
you can get out in front of it

14:37.902 --> 14:39.862
and stop these changes from happening.

14:42.907 --> 14:44.492
Talk to us.

14:45.376 --> 14:47.211
When they kicked me out of school,

14:47.245 --> 14:48.979
I didn't care where they sent me.

14:49.013 --> 14:50.706
I didn't care about anything.

14:51.950 --> 14:53.543
It was like, whatever.

14:54.686 --> 14:55.795
But then...

14:58.757 --> 15:00.891
Things just got better here.

15:00.925 --> 15:02.301
That's right.

15:02.861 --> 15:05.229
Things were starting to make sense.

15:05.263 --> 15:06.730
I felt like I belonged here.

15:06.765 --> 15:09.066
But now that I'm starting
to get the hang of it

15:09.100 --> 15:11.835
my mom is trying to ruin my life again.

15:13.738 --> 15:17.574
No one... no one
is ruining your life, Avi.

15:17.609 --> 15:20.486
I... I don't even think
anyone has that power.

15:20.912 --> 15:22.746
All right? You put in the work.

15:22.781 --> 15:25.074
You learned the tools.
You can cope anywhere.

15:25.917 --> 15:27.702
Even Missouri.

15:28.753 --> 15:30.287
How do you know?

15:30.321 --> 15:32.540
Just listen to me, okay?

15:34.058 --> 15:35.751
'Cause I'm good at what I do.

15:36.394 --> 15:38.421
I can promise you this:

15:39.297 --> 15:40.923
you are ready.

15:44.636 --> 15:46.770
- He is not ready.
- What?

15:46.805 --> 15:48.272
Were we both in the same session?

15:48.306 --> 15:50.307
Avi accused his mother...

15:50.341 --> 15:52.609
of ruining his life again.

15:52.644 --> 15:53.677
And?

15:53.711 --> 15:55.946
Avi was admitted for
a serious outburst at school.

15:55.980 --> 15:57.714
Kids were teasing him
over his learning disability,

15:57.749 --> 15:59.316
but it had nothing to do with his mother.

15:59.350 --> 16:00.504
What are you saying?

16:00.538 --> 16:02.252
I'm saying whatever's going on with him

16:02.287 --> 16:03.754
was triggered only once
he learned he was leaving.

16:03.788 --> 16:05.956
Avi's mother can't
just change her travel plans.

16:05.990 --> 16:08.358
Her new job is expecting
her there on Monday.

16:09.928 --> 16:11.028
I need more time with him.

16:11.062 --> 16:15.332
Dr. Frome, his discharge
paperwork has been filed.

16:15.366 --> 16:17.710
I know. I know.

16:18.203 --> 16:20.804
Just let me talk to him.

16:20.839 --> 16:22.272
Alone.

16:22.307 --> 16:24.007
Let me see if I can get through to him.

16:24.042 --> 16:25.635
That's it.

16:38.122 --> 16:39.941
Thank you.

16:40.825 --> 16:42.826
Oh, um, Dr. Kao?

16:42.861 --> 16:44.995
How do you spell your last name?

16:45.363 --> 16:48.131
Uh, K-A-O?

16:48.166 --> 16:51.001
"Dr. Agnes Kao..."

16:57.809 --> 17:00.277
Thomas Jefferson once stayed

17:00.311 --> 17:02.346
in our Presidential Suite.

17:02.380 --> 17:04.314
- Is that right?
- Mm.

17:04.348 --> 17:06.116
This room has housed the architect

17:06.150 --> 17:08.094
of the Declaration of Independence.

17:08.720 --> 17:12.356
And now @NancyPants from Yelp.

17:12.390 --> 17:13.957
I know how this looks.

17:13.992 --> 17:15.858
Yeah, I feel like if you did

17:15.894 --> 17:17.327
we wouldn't be having this conversation.

17:17.362 --> 17:18.862
This was not my idea, I swear.

17:18.896 --> 17:20.864
- It was Max's.
- Hold on.

17:20.898 --> 17:22.866
The ludicrous coddling of Nancy Nan...

17:22.901 --> 17:25.068
a woman who isn't even sick...
came from Max?

17:25.103 --> 17:26.203
Yes.

17:26.237 --> 17:29.139
And if his error in judgment
leads to an enhancement

17:29.173 --> 17:31.008
of my online status,

17:31.042 --> 17:34.044
well, this is just a happy coincidence.

17:34.078 --> 17:37.381
Did Max seem like himself to you?

17:37.415 --> 17:39.716
He seemed erratic.

17:39.751 --> 17:42.753
Annoyed, then excited, then distracted,

17:42.787 --> 17:43.921
all in quick succession.

17:43.955 --> 17:47.891
And if it was anyone but Max,
I would have got worried.

17:49.394 --> 17:50.650
Should I be worried?

17:54.966 --> 17:58.001
Aww, she found the fizzy water.

18:10.281 --> 18:11.643
Brought everything I could find.

18:11.678 --> 18:13.917
Action logs, nursing notes,
imaging studies.

18:13.952 --> 18:15.752
Oh, and here are those, uh, ultrasounds.

18:15.787 --> 18:17.515
Oh, good work.

18:17.550 --> 18:18.689
I'm sorry about this, Dr. Reynolds.

18:18.723 --> 18:20.090
I didn't really expect
Dr. Goodman would want

18:20.124 --> 18:21.291
to see every last scan.

18:21.326 --> 18:22.292
It's not your fault.

18:22.327 --> 18:25.128
This, uh, level
of due diligence is extreme.

18:25.163 --> 18:26.543
That's one way to put it.

18:26.577 --> 18:29.132
But my work on Officer McNeil
was solid, you know?

18:29.167 --> 18:32.511
Our job now is just
to present the case clearly.

18:33.596 --> 18:35.105
Hey, can we talk?

18:35.139 --> 18:36.940
I'll get these loaded onto the computer.

18:36.975 --> 18:37.975
Thanks.

18:39.110 --> 18:40.199
Hey.

18:40.233 --> 18:41.912
- I don't like this, Floyd.
- It's fine.

18:41.946 --> 18:42.980
It doesn't feel fine.

18:43.014 --> 18:45.215
Feels like you're putting
yourself on the line.

18:45.249 --> 18:48.218
Okay, these conferences
are for internal use only.

18:48.252 --> 18:49.386
They're protected.

18:49.420 --> 18:50.420
But we both know that Max has been

18:50.455 --> 18:52.122
fielding calls on this one.

18:52.156 --> 18:54.157
From the mayor, the police commissioner.

18:54.192 --> 18:56.560
Board of Directors,
malpractice department at HCC.

18:56.594 --> 18:57.627
Evie...

18:57.662 --> 18:59.563
There was a police officer
that died on your table,

18:59.597 --> 19:00.831
under your knife.

19:00.865 --> 19:03.918
You know that they're gonna be
looking for someone to blame.

19:12.143 --> 19:15.312
Hate to say it, but it sure
feels like Max is trying

19:15.346 --> 19:17.723
to make sure that person is you.

19:18.316 --> 19:20.184
Dr. Reynolds?

19:21.119 --> 19:24.187
Are you actually ready?

19:32.197 --> 19:35.085
<i>What we have here is the
pre-op echocardiogram</i>

19:35.110 --> 19:36.110
<i>for Officer McNeil.</i>

19:36.144 --> 19:38.045
Now, let's focus on where
the rupture occurred.

19:38.080 --> 19:39.914
Here to here, all right?

19:39.948 --> 19:41.706
.34 centimeters

19:41.740 --> 19:44.251
at the thinnest width
of the right ventricular wall.

19:44.286 --> 19:45.405
Normal.

19:45.440 --> 19:47.795
Also, normal valve function.

19:47.829 --> 19:49.890
Normal papillary musculature.

19:49.925 --> 19:54.228
And, as noted before, normal echo.

19:54.262 --> 19:55.678
Hmm.

19:56.898 --> 19:58.556
How about a second opinion?

19:59.134 --> 20:00.766
Dr. Jessup?

20:01.636 --> 20:05.005
Yes, it appears normal.

20:05.941 --> 20:07.375
How about you, Dr. Flores?

20:07.409 --> 20:08.943
Don't you think
the right ventricular wall

20:08.977 --> 20:10.945
looks a little thin?

20:10.979 --> 20:12.713
Uh, no.

20:12.748 --> 20:16.350
It looks like a normal thickness to me.

20:17.293 --> 20:19.577
Is there anyone here who disagrees?

20:20.255 --> 20:21.789
Dr. Nottingham?

20:21.823 --> 20:23.290
I see what Dr. Reynolds sees.

20:23.325 --> 20:25.259
Normal ultrasound.

20:25.293 --> 20:28.262
Well, an ultrasound is just
an approximate image

20:28.296 --> 20:29.397
of the real heart.

20:29.431 --> 20:33.033
But, fortunately for us,
the real heart is still here

20:33.068 --> 20:34.869
down in pathology, so I think we should

20:34.903 --> 20:36.971
all take a trip down there

20:37.005 --> 20:38.806
and have a closer look for ourselves.

20:38.840 --> 20:40.107
You can't be serious.

20:40.142 --> 20:42.143
Oh, but I am serious.

20:42.177 --> 20:44.945
Once we examine the real heart,
then we'll know

20:44.980 --> 20:47.815
if these readings were in fact,
as you say, normal.

20:52.320 --> 20:53.754
Right now. Here we go.

20:53.789 --> 20:55.070
Everybody up.

21:00.162 --> 21:01.911
You know you can talk to me, right?

21:05.100 --> 21:06.749
It's just me and you.

21:07.469 --> 21:09.804
In here, just like before.

21:09.838 --> 21:12.072
It'll never be like it was before.

21:12.107 --> 21:13.908
Not where I'm going.

21:13.942 --> 21:15.925
- Okay, let's talk about that.
- Let's not.

21:16.978 --> 21:19.470
Avi, I believe there is
something in your life

21:20.015 --> 21:21.916
that really upsets you.

21:21.950 --> 21:25.419
Something you've worked very,
very hard to lock away.

21:25.454 --> 21:27.087
And now, for some reason,

21:27.122 --> 21:29.690
that thing has snuck back around

21:29.724 --> 21:30.858
to the front of your mind.

21:30.892 --> 21:32.983
For some reason, that's all
you can think about right now.

21:34.196 --> 21:35.362
You know I can help you.

21:35.397 --> 21:37.364
I can help you manage these emotions,

21:37.399 --> 21:38.866
but first you have to let me in.

21:38.900 --> 21:40.801
I don't want to move back there.

21:40.836 --> 21:43.037
- I hate it there.
- You hate it in Missouri?

21:43.071 --> 21:44.138
Why do I have to go with her?

21:44.172 --> 21:45.773
Why can't she just go back there

21:45.807 --> 21:48.624
and do her dumb job there
and I could stay here, right?

21:49.544 --> 21:51.168
Don't make me go.

21:51.636 --> 21:53.132
Does this have something
to do with your mom?

21:53.167 --> 21:54.281
No!

21:54.316 --> 21:56.131
My mom doesn't know anything about it.

21:57.486 --> 21:58.968
Doesn't know anything about what?

22:00.188 --> 22:01.856
No, no, no.

22:01.890 --> 22:04.556
Avi, what doesn't she know about?

22:05.158 --> 22:06.227
You have to tell me.

22:06.261 --> 22:07.995
You gotta let me in
so we can face it together.

22:08.029 --> 22:09.812
I don't want to face it!

22:10.079 --> 22:12.509
I want to stay here, but nobody
cares about what I want!

22:12.534 --> 22:14.735
- That is not true.
- It is true!

22:14.769 --> 22:17.471
If you cared about me at all
you'd be on my side right now.

22:17.506 --> 22:20.074
You'd be on my side
instead of working so hard

22:20.108 --> 22:22.510
to ship me off to Missouri!

22:31.786 --> 22:33.419
I can't go back.

22:41.296 --> 22:43.831
- Hi.
- Have you got a minute?

22:43.865 --> 22:46.400
Well, despite this whimsical tableau

22:46.434 --> 22:47.568
I'm actually quite busy.

22:47.602 --> 22:50.504
- Tough case?
- Understatement.

22:50.539 --> 22:53.374
But, you know, nothing fires up the brain

22:53.408 --> 22:56.494
like sugar and titanium dioxide.

22:56.529 --> 22:59.046
Well, before you slip into insulin shock,

22:59.080 --> 23:01.882
I... I want to get
your professional opinion.

23:01.917 --> 23:03.250
About?

23:03.824 --> 23:05.534
About Max.

23:08.223 --> 23:11.125
You know, speculating
on the boss's mental health

23:11.159 --> 23:12.964
is not my favorite thing.

23:12.999 --> 23:14.184
Nor mine,

23:14.219 --> 23:16.297
but if the medical director
of New Amsterdam's ability

23:16.331 --> 23:17.464
to make decisions is compromised,

23:17.499 --> 23:19.366
then I need to know about it.

23:19.401 --> 23:22.102
Every cancer patient struggles,
but in the past few days

23:22.137 --> 23:24.605
he has been exhibiting
behavior that's erratic.

23:24.639 --> 23:27.207
Unstable, even angry.

23:27.242 --> 23:28.807
That's not Max.

23:29.311 --> 23:32.478
Well, I do, um... I have a theory but...

23:33.148 --> 23:34.481
I don't think you're gonna like it.

23:34.516 --> 23:35.814
Go on.

23:36.484 --> 23:38.052
It's you.

23:38.086 --> 23:39.443
Me?

23:40.121 --> 23:42.156
This all started once you passed him off

23:42.190 --> 23:43.989
to Dr. Stauton like a hot potato.

23:44.024 --> 23:45.092
That's irrelevant.

23:45.126 --> 23:46.704
Our treatment plans are almost identical.

23:46.738 --> 23:50.297
Yeah, but your relationships
with Max are not, are they?

23:50.332 --> 23:51.999
Dr. Stauton is an excellent doctor.

23:52.033 --> 23:54.335
- Max knows that.
- Yeah, and he respects her.

23:54.369 --> 23:57.304
But he believes in you.

23:59.307 --> 24:01.342
I need your help right away.

24:01.376 --> 24:03.010
- Hey.
- Not now.

24:03.044 --> 24:05.312
Okay.

24:05.347 --> 24:06.480
This better be important.

24:06.514 --> 24:08.349
I am at the end of my rope now.

24:08.383 --> 24:10.618
I have a patient who,
no matter the treatment,

24:10.652 --> 24:11.861
cannot be helped.

24:11.895 --> 24:13.926
Is this about your spinocerebellar
degeneration patient?

24:13.960 --> 24:16.924
No, he's fine. It's about @NancyPants.

24:16.958 --> 24:19.093
I brought this on myself, didn't I?

24:19.127 --> 24:21.362
Look at this.

24:23.398 --> 24:26.533
"The 100-year-old doctor
just tried to buy me off.

24:26.568 --> 24:28.435
"Pro tip: want a better review?

24:28.470 --> 24:30.638
"Don't give me the scratchiest
sheets on the planet.

24:30.672 --> 24:32.006
One star."

24:32.040 --> 24:33.674
She is insufferable.

24:33.708 --> 24:35.542
Isn't she in the Presidential Suite?

24:35.577 --> 24:37.678
Yes, and she's still displeased.

24:37.712 --> 24:40.981
Wait, we use 600 thread-count
Egyptian cotton in there.

24:41.016 --> 24:43.283
Nothing will ever be
good enough for this woman.

24:43.318 --> 24:45.052
It's hard to believe
she's a woman of fine taste

24:45.086 --> 24:47.121
given her screenname is @NancyPants.

24:47.155 --> 24:48.679
I don't know what more to do.

24:50.392 --> 24:52.159
Wait, what if she actually had

24:52.193 --> 24:53.639
incredibly sensitive skin?

24:53.673 --> 24:56.725
It has to be the most
sensitive skin on this planet,

24:56.759 --> 24:58.147
or...

25:01.813 --> 25:04.114
- Oh, dear.
- Exactly.

25:08.610 --> 25:11.345
- Max, we should talk.
- Not really a good time.

25:15.216 --> 25:16.383
What is this?

25:16.418 --> 25:18.552
A fool's errand.

25:29.064 --> 25:30.497
If we look at the patient's heart,

25:30.532 --> 25:33.067
we see the chambers intact.

25:33.101 --> 25:34.558
Normal in appearance.

25:35.036 --> 25:38.605
But let's turn to the cardiac injury.

25:38.640 --> 25:42.042
Even after this dramatic
free wall rupture,

25:42.077 --> 25:44.278
the actual cardiac tissue itself

25:44.312 --> 25:46.028
is amazingly normal.

25:46.062 --> 25:47.448
No thinning?

25:47.482 --> 25:49.516
- None.
- No?

25:49.551 --> 25:53.287
No, uh, infiltrative process
like amyloid or fibrosis?

25:53.321 --> 25:56.330
No, no abnormalities whatsoever.

25:56.758 --> 26:00.060
Dr. Reynolds, what about
your, uh, mental state

26:00.095 --> 26:02.044
during the surgery?

26:03.131 --> 26:04.631
- Nothing of particular note.
- Really?

26:04.666 --> 26:06.700
Because I know for a fact on that day

26:06.735 --> 26:08.602
that you were, uh, distracted.

26:08.636 --> 26:10.437
No, I was fine.

26:10.471 --> 26:12.439
If you recall, you spent
the entire morning

26:12.474 --> 26:14.056
going over your budgets.

26:14.776 --> 26:16.710
It's unrelated and you know it.

26:16.745 --> 26:18.837
Not if it compromised your
concentration during the surgery.

26:18.871 --> 26:20.748
You honestly believe
I was still thinking about

26:20.782 --> 26:22.649
- your stupid budgets?
- I don't know. You tell me, Floyd.

26:22.684 --> 26:24.454
- The woman died on your table.
- You know what?

26:24.489 --> 26:25.817
That's it.

26:26.187 --> 26:28.489
This M&M is over. Everyone back to work.

26:28.523 --> 26:30.224
Now!

26:31.793 --> 26:34.061
Except for you. We got business.

26:37.688 --> 26:39.908
<i>- You were way out of line.
- Not if I'm right.</i>

26:39.943 --> 26:42.057
<i>Well, you're not right,</i> f
<i>and that wasn't an M&M.</i>

26:42.091 --> 26:43.663
That was a public shaming.

26:43.697 --> 26:45.627
I am only asking the tough questions.

26:45.661 --> 26:48.563
No, you are undermining my
credibility at this hospital.

26:48.598 --> 26:51.066
In front of my staff.
In front of my colleagues.

26:51.100 --> 26:53.301
Are you really making
this patient's death about you?

26:53.336 --> 26:55.704
No, you made it about me when
you brought up my mental state.

26:55.738 --> 26:57.806
The whole point of this exercise

26:57.840 --> 26:59.975
was to determine, once and for all,

27:00.009 --> 27:03.144
if Officer Marie McNeil's death
was preventable.

27:03.179 --> 27:06.147
We have sifted through
every notation, every scan,

27:06.182 --> 27:08.049
every piece of recorded imaging.

27:08.084 --> 27:10.785
Hell, 50 people
just watched you poke and prod

27:10.820 --> 27:11.846
at the poor woman's heart.

27:11.881 --> 27:13.622
There's nothing else to investigate!

27:13.656 --> 27:14.956
- Then we start over!
- Max.

27:14.991 --> 27:17.158
You are unbelievable, you know that?

27:17.193 --> 27:19.261
Yeah, no, we start over. We dig deeper.

27:19.295 --> 27:20.895
We keep looking until we find...

27:20.930 --> 27:22.897
No!

27:25.134 --> 27:26.545
What did you say?

27:27.837 --> 27:29.938
In what world do you think
I'd stick around

27:29.972 --> 27:31.633
for more of this?

27:34.944 --> 27:39.114
I was so excited
when you offered me chair.

27:39.148 --> 27:41.349
To build a department that...

27:41.384 --> 27:43.918
that we could both be proud of.

27:43.953 --> 27:46.421
An environment based on mutual respect.

27:46.455 --> 27:49.624
But in one afternoon you
managed to tear it all down.

27:49.659 --> 27:51.626
In one afternoon you showed
how little you trust me,

27:51.661 --> 27:53.697
and you did it in front of everyone.

28:01.003 --> 28:03.672
You can expect my resignation.

28:16.085 --> 28:18.820
Do you want to tell me
what this is really about?

28:25.995 --> 28:28.330
You're not my doctor, remember?

28:34.704 --> 28:36.705
We must examine you right away.

28:36.739 --> 28:39.437
- I'm trying to sleep, here.
- You're on your phone.

28:39.472 --> 28:40.845
That's how I get to sleep.

28:40.879 --> 28:42.877
Blue light disrupts
the production of melatonin,

28:42.912 --> 28:44.479
but we'll talk about that later.

28:44.513 --> 28:46.348
Uh, do you mind showing me
your legs, please?

28:46.382 --> 28:48.483
Um...

28:48.517 --> 28:50.085
Dr. Kapoor believes your discomfort

28:50.119 --> 28:51.922
has nothing to do with the sheets.

28:53.173 --> 28:55.156
O-okay, sure.

29:00.096 --> 29:01.681
Oh.

29:03.065 --> 29:05.066
How long have you had this rash?

29:05.101 --> 29:07.936
I've never noticed it before.

29:08.396 --> 29:09.871
Can I have that glass?

29:19.448 --> 29:22.050
The rash doesn't blanch under pressure.

29:22.084 --> 29:24.018
We must get her
to the procedure room now.

29:24.053 --> 29:26.054
Wait, why?

29:26.088 --> 29:28.390
Ms. Nan, it appears you have contracted

29:28.424 --> 29:29.891
meningococcal meningitis.

29:29.925 --> 29:32.295
If we don't treat you now, you could die.

29:34.096 --> 29:36.269
I need a procedure room, stat.

29:48.010 --> 29:49.310
Dr. Sharpe.

29:49.345 --> 29:51.606
Something I can help you with?

29:53.983 --> 29:55.777
I need to talk to you...

29:56.452 --> 29:58.321
about Max.

29:59.989 --> 30:01.908
Somewhat irregular.

30:03.359 --> 30:04.828
I know.

30:06.529 --> 30:08.014
Come in.

30:17.039 --> 30:18.273
Hey, Avi. Hi.

30:18.307 --> 30:20.385
Yeah, come in. Come in.

30:21.510 --> 30:23.179
My mom's waiting.

30:24.447 --> 30:27.482
I just wanted to, you know...

30:29.018 --> 30:31.319
Say goodbye real quick.

30:31.353 --> 30:33.440
You have my number, you know.

30:33.956 --> 30:35.901
You can call me anytime. Anytime.

30:37.059 --> 30:38.445
Thank you...

30:39.195 --> 30:41.496
for, you know...

30:41.530 --> 30:43.331
trying to fix me.

30:43.365 --> 30:45.033
I know I let you down.

30:45.067 --> 30:47.329
- I'm really sorry for that, Doc.
- You never let me down.

30:48.747 --> 30:50.271
But you couldn't fix me, so...

30:50.306 --> 30:52.106
Hey, stop, stop.
Listen to me, listen to me.

30:52.141 --> 30:53.543
"Fixed"...

30:54.210 --> 30:55.510
that's not a thing.

30:55.544 --> 30:56.878
It doesn't exist.

30:56.912 --> 30:59.147
Nobody leaves this hospital fixed.

30:59.181 --> 31:00.281
Do you understand?

31:00.675 --> 31:03.985
My job is to give you the tools
to get through the day.

31:06.355 --> 31:07.713
That's it.

31:12.161 --> 31:13.394
I wish I could just stay here.

31:13.429 --> 31:14.996
Hey, hey.

31:15.030 --> 31:16.965
You're gonna make it to Missouri.

31:16.999 --> 31:18.568
But that's just the beginning.

31:19.034 --> 31:20.902
Don't forget about Table Mountain.

31:20.936 --> 31:22.403
The Parthenon.

31:22.438 --> 31:23.838
Right?

31:23.873 --> 31:25.700
Gonna hike all the way to the top.

31:26.785 --> 31:28.543
Right to the top.

31:28.577 --> 31:30.345
Yeah.

31:34.884 --> 31:36.518
Use the tools.

31:36.920 --> 31:39.339
- Use the tools.
- Every day.

31:40.222 --> 31:41.549
Every day.

31:42.625 --> 31:44.094
Come on.

31:46.228 --> 31:48.363
You're gonna be great.

31:51.100 --> 31:52.367
Avi.

31:52.401 --> 31:53.535
Hey.

31:54.084 --> 31:55.603
It's time to go.

32:00.943 --> 32:02.577
All right.

32:02.611 --> 32:05.213
Bye, Doc. Bye, Avi.

32:13.589 --> 32:16.357
Pulse ox 97, BP 100 over 60.

32:16.392 --> 32:18.893
When you feel the pop...

32:21.163 --> 32:23.133
You know you are in.

32:24.266 --> 32:27.201
- There.
- HR normative range.

32:30.139 --> 32:32.440
- Nancy?
- Here you go.

32:32.809 --> 32:34.275
You okay?

32:34.894 --> 32:37.412
Uh, I guess so.

32:37.446 --> 32:39.080
We are collecting the fluid

32:39.114 --> 32:43.117
to identify which bacteria
is making you so sick.

32:43.152 --> 32:44.953
Additional LP tubes on the tray.

32:44.987 --> 32:48.089
I just came in for a simple sleep study.

32:52.595 --> 32:54.164
Nancy?

32:55.040 --> 32:57.565
- She's unresponsive.
- Heart rate is up to 124.

32:57.600 --> 32:58.967
BP's down to 80 over 40.

32:59.001 --> 33:00.301
She's going into septic shock.

33:00.336 --> 33:01.569
Deliver to the lab. Hurry.

33:07.009 --> 33:09.110
Rapid response,
procedure room number two.

33:12.147 --> 33:13.314
What the hell was that?

33:14.100 --> 33:17.285
I did everything in my power
to save this patient's life.

33:17.319 --> 33:18.953
I did everything right,

33:18.988 --> 33:20.455
and now it's gonna bury my career?

33:20.489 --> 33:22.624
This doesn't need to land on you.

33:22.658 --> 33:25.760
Max was... I don't know what that was.

33:25.794 --> 33:27.428
Out of control.

33:27.463 --> 33:29.263
Insane. Tyrannical.

33:29.298 --> 33:31.532
Babe, you have legal recourse here.

33:31.567 --> 33:33.101
I have a friend at Adler & Morgan

33:33.135 --> 33:34.669
who would take on this case
at the drop of a hat.

33:35.851 --> 33:37.123
Yeah?

33:39.174 --> 33:41.075
Not the best time.

33:43.254 --> 33:45.279
W-we should talk.

33:51.520 --> 33:52.972
Text me later.

34:00.403 --> 34:02.730
This better not be you defending him.

34:02.765 --> 34:04.165
Not after what he did.

34:04.199 --> 34:06.601
No, I... I can't defend that.

34:08.170 --> 34:09.781
- But, uh...
- But?

34:10.438 --> 34:11.491
But?

34:13.993 --> 34:16.043
Max's cancer.

34:17.446 --> 34:21.549
It's not responding
to chemo or radiation.

34:35.097 --> 34:36.516
How bad?

34:38.266 --> 34:39.565
It's bad.

34:45.641 --> 34:47.608
When did he find out?

34:47.643 --> 34:50.274
Stauton told him this morning.

35:08.305 --> 35:10.139
<i>Got enough light on the keyhole?</i>

35:10.173 --> 35:13.109
Passing through the cerebral cortex.

35:13.143 --> 35:16.478
The center of the infection
is in the third ventricle.

35:16.512 --> 35:19.248
I don't think you'll be able to hit it.

35:19.282 --> 35:22.018
Keep looking at the CT.

35:23.954 --> 35:26.436
Go ahead and remove.

35:26.470 --> 35:29.143
4 centimeters to the lateral ventricle.

35:29.168 --> 35:30.669
You're too close.

35:30.703 --> 35:33.372
I can make it.

35:35.708 --> 35:38.076
If you clip that she'll never walk again.

35:38.111 --> 35:40.312
Just imagine that review.

35:42.015 --> 35:45.851
Advancing caudal
to the corticospinal tract.

35:48.755 --> 35:50.173
You're clear.

35:51.090 --> 35:55.160
And I am into ventricle.

36:00.800 --> 36:03.101
Injecting...

36:03.136 --> 36:04.836
Cephillicam.

36:10.243 --> 36:14.212
Heart rate and blood pressure are stable.

36:22.088 --> 36:23.422
43 years ago,

36:23.456 --> 36:26.250
I made a decision to be a doctor.

36:27.260 --> 36:30.129
Dedicate my life
to the service of others.

36:30.930 --> 36:34.132
It was never about reviews.

36:55.955 --> 36:57.923
- I heard.
- Mm.

36:57.957 --> 37:00.076
Yeah, well, what can you do?

37:03.129 --> 37:06.565
I get why you pushed hard.

37:08.468 --> 37:10.378
I want answers too.

37:16.142 --> 37:18.636
How do we just accept that her death...

37:19.979 --> 37:23.982
or anyone's death, was random?

37:25.138 --> 37:26.672
Life, death.

37:26.697 --> 37:29.766
It can't be arbitrary.

37:29.989 --> 37:31.456
It's not.

37:31.491 --> 37:34.960
I just thought maybe
there was something...

37:36.362 --> 37:37.963
That we missed.

37:37.997 --> 37:40.132
You know, maybe there was something

37:40.166 --> 37:41.957
that we could have done differently.

37:41.982 --> 37:45.455
Maybe... maybe I could have
done a lot of things...

37:46.305 --> 37:47.749
differently.

37:48.641 --> 37:50.752
Sometimes you do everything right.

37:51.644 --> 37:52.962
You know?

37:54.047 --> 37:55.631
And get the same result.

37:56.649 --> 37:58.176
As though you've done nothing.

38:01.020 --> 38:04.156
I'm sorry, Floyd.

38:04.190 --> 38:06.191
I don't know...

38:06.225 --> 38:07.727
what else to say or how else to say it.

38:07.762 --> 38:08.978
I just...

38:09.529 --> 38:10.980
I don't know who that...

38:11.497 --> 38:14.199
who that was today.

38:15.868 --> 38:17.695
I mean, I look in the mirror and I...

38:18.404 --> 38:20.224
I don't even recognize that person.

38:23.376 --> 38:26.079
What's happening to you is not fair.

38:26.412 --> 38:28.346
There's no reason behind it.

38:28.381 --> 38:30.482
No answer that will make it better.

38:30.516 --> 38:31.650
I know.

38:31.684 --> 38:33.335
I just don't want my life...

38:37.123 --> 38:38.508
or my death...

38:40.093 --> 38:41.385
to be...

38:42.395 --> 38:43.721
arbitrary.

38:45.104 --> 38:46.155
Okay.

38:47.100 --> 38:50.019
Okay, well, the way I see it...

38:50.970 --> 38:52.938
you got a choice.

38:54.307 --> 38:56.484
You either let the randomness of this...

38:57.210 --> 38:58.653
beat you down...

38:59.278 --> 39:03.115
or you pick yourself up
and you just keep fighting.

39:05.418 --> 39:07.227
Endings be damned.

39:18.931 --> 39:20.398
Hey.

39:20.433 --> 39:22.308
I know what you're gonna say.

39:25.438 --> 39:27.473
I like your hat.

39:36.791 --> 39:38.984
<i>I have been sitting here all afternoon</i>

39:39.018 --> 39:41.419
researching alternative options.

39:41.454 --> 39:44.589
Have you heard of the Norton-Simon model?

39:44.624 --> 39:47.259
- No.
- It's called DDC.

39:47.293 --> 39:50.328
- Dose-dense chemo.
- "Dose-dense"?

39:50.363 --> 39:52.097
Essentially, it's the same dose

39:52.131 --> 39:53.498
of cisplatin that you're on,

39:53.533 --> 39:56.434
but we would administer it
twice as frequently.

39:56.469 --> 40:00.005
By amping up the quantity
and frequency of your treatment

40:00.039 --> 40:04.109
we could interrupt the rapid growth phase

40:04.143 --> 40:06.311
of your malignant tumor cells.

40:07.986 --> 40:09.438
What's the catch?

40:10.516 --> 40:12.584
If you were experiencing side effects

40:12.618 --> 40:14.270
from your normal dose,

40:15.121 --> 40:16.755
DDC is the equivalent

40:16.789 --> 40:19.658
of napalming your internal organs.

40:19.692 --> 40:24.329
Essentially, it's a human
scorched-earth policy.

40:26.291 --> 40:28.993
Take time to think it over.
It's a big decision.

40:29.402 --> 40:33.004
So read that article,
and then tomorrow...

40:33.039 --> 40:34.440
Can we start tonight?

40:37.677 --> 40:39.003
I wanna keep fighting.

40:41.419 --> 40:43.127
Endings be damned.

40:54.527 --> 40:57.229
Hey. Still here?

40:57.263 --> 40:59.497
I had a lot of paperwork to finish,

40:59.532 --> 41:01.533
given everything I saw today.

41:01.567 --> 41:03.301
Yeah, yeah.

41:03.336 --> 41:06.671
Yeah, days like today,
they, uh... they hit hard, man.

41:07.707 --> 41:10.208
Don't always get the time
you need with a patient,

41:10.243 --> 41:12.544
so we do what we can and we find solace

41:12.578 --> 41:15.180
in knowing that our contribution helped,

41:15.214 --> 41:16.681
if even just a little bit.

41:16.716 --> 41:20.018
Dr. Frome, I wasn't filling out paperwork

41:20.052 --> 41:21.979
- for Avi Mantell.
- No?

41:22.004 --> 41:25.023
I was opening
a formal investigation on you.

41:29.943 --> 41:31.069
I don't understand.

41:31.103 --> 41:32.597
What I witnessed today

41:32.632 --> 41:37.168
was a therapist actively and knowingly...

41:37.203 --> 41:41.172
forming non-therapeutic
alliances with his patients.

41:41.207 --> 41:42.440
No, that's not right.

41:42.475 --> 41:44.843
The physical exchanges with Avi?

41:44.877 --> 41:47.846
The emotional boundaries?
You overstepped with him.

41:47.880 --> 41:50.715
It crossed a line, Dr. Frome.

41:55.105 --> 41:57.164
This is my official report.

41:57.607 --> 41:59.627
I wanted you to hear it from me.

42:01.945 --> 42:03.504
I'm sorry...

42:04.247 --> 42:06.348
but our patients must come first.
