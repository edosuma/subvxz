00:02.570 --> 00:04.448
NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system

00:04.506 --> 00:08.420
the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups,

00:08.477 --> 00:10.252
the police
who investigate crime

00:10.312 --> 00:13.088
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

00:13.148 --> 00:15.355
These are their stories.

00:15.617 --> 00:17.824
I'm not signing over
nothing for that boy.

00:17.886 --> 00:19.229
Rondell will be
in Rikers Island

00:19.287 --> 00:20.857
a year before he gets a trial.

00:20.922 --> 00:22.902
Good. He needs watching.

00:22.958 --> 00:24.369
I'll watch him close now.

00:24.426 --> 00:25.700
Mmm-hmm.

00:25.760 --> 00:27.501
Gray hair don't make me stupid.

00:27.562 --> 00:29.269
See what the man says.

00:30.131 --> 00:33.374
Hello? Hello?
Anybody here?

00:40.175 --> 00:42.712
Man's said all he's gonna say.

00:43.912 --> 00:46.119
Manny Ehrlich.
One to the head.

00:46.248 --> 00:48.455
Putting in a Saturday
night for his family.

00:48.517 --> 00:51.623
Putting the skells we
arrest back on the street.

00:52.320 --> 00:53.355
Listen.
OFFICER: Yeah?

00:53.421 --> 00:55.992
Call their security company, find
out who the other desk belongs to

00:56.057 --> 00:57.331
and wake him up.
All right?

00:57.392 --> 01:01.841
Rey, look at this. Pineapple Street.
Brooklyn Heights.

01:02.797 --> 01:04.037
Guy was doing all right.

01:04.099 --> 01:05.271
BRISCOE: Mmm-hmm.

01:05.333 --> 01:09.543
You mind? Looks like
they popped the hinges.

01:10.505 --> 01:12.712
Doesn't look like
they got to the safe.

01:12.807 --> 01:15.083
Yeah. Maybe that
was the problem.

01:16.044 --> 01:19.423
Whoa! Wait a minute. You
through with Mr. Ehrlich here?

01:19.481 --> 01:21.051
Uh-huh.

01:24.986 --> 01:26.192
(CHUCKLES)

01:27.355 --> 01:29.232
Round's still live.

01:29.658 --> 01:31.535
Dead-on at the
client's chair.

01:32.360 --> 01:34.340
The bail-bonds business.

02:25.347 --> 02:28.351
Manny. My poor Manny.

02:29.718 --> 02:30.788
Mrs. Ehrlich...

02:30.852 --> 02:31.853
JENNA: Mom.

02:32.787 --> 02:34.095
(BOTH CRYING)

02:35.123 --> 02:37.160
She's been up all night.

02:38.059 --> 02:40.596
My dad usually calls
when he's gonna be late.

02:41.663 --> 02:42.664
Mrs. Ehrlich.

02:43.031 --> 02:46.444
It's important that we get the
information as soon as possible.

02:47.002 --> 02:48.777
It'll be okay, Mom.

02:51.640 --> 02:56.453
I think she took something.
You might as well talk to me.

02:56.511 --> 03:00.049
Was it unusual for your dad
to work on a Saturday night?

03:00.115 --> 03:04.291
He never did, but a man
called around dinnertime.

03:04.753 --> 03:07.290
BRISCOE: Do you know
what the call was about?

03:08.990 --> 03:11.766
They were back and forth
with phone calls.

03:12.527 --> 03:14.700
Then my dad said
he had to go in.

03:14.763 --> 03:18.973
Manny said it could be
a nice piece of business.

03:20.435 --> 03:22.381
JENNA: It'll be okay, Mom.

03:22.971 --> 03:26.976
Perp used a .38, close range. Ballistics
says the slug was pretty beat up.

03:27.042 --> 03:28.453
Any prints at the scene?

03:28.510 --> 03:31.047
Too many. Half the ones we've
run have felony sheets.

03:31.112 --> 03:33.388
Let me guess. The other
half are their mothers.

03:33.448 --> 03:34.620
You make it a robbery?

03:34.683 --> 03:36.754
We talked to his partner.
Nobody got into the safe,

03:36.818 --> 03:38.798
but we found
a jimmied-open lockbox.

03:38.853 --> 03:40.628
He was at home doing
business over the phone.

03:40.689 --> 03:42.293
Somebody called him
into his office.

03:42.357 --> 03:44.359
They're closed on
Saturday nights.

03:44.426 --> 03:45.734
We're waiting on the IUDs.

03:45.794 --> 03:47.273
Sounds like a setup.

03:47.328 --> 03:49.137
These bondsmen are
in the loan business.

03:49.197 --> 03:50.608
You know, a client jumps bail

03:50.665 --> 03:52.667
they go after the house,
the family jewels,

03:52.734 --> 03:54.077
anything they can
get their hands on.

03:54.135 --> 03:55.876
Makes for some happy relatives.

03:55.937 --> 03:58.508
Well, go through Ehrlich's
files, see who skipped bail.

03:58.573 --> 03:59.984
Talk to the
assigned A.D.A.s.

04:00.041 --> 04:02.715
Maybe they could point you
in the right direction.

04:04.512 --> 04:06.651
Oscar Liriano?
He was a narcotics case.

04:06.715 --> 04:07.716
He jumped bail.

04:07.782 --> 04:09.022
Yeah. About three
weeks ago.

04:09.084 --> 04:10.085
What was he looking at?

04:10.151 --> 04:12.654
Possession three.
Twelve-and-a-half-to-25.

04:12.721 --> 04:13.893
What do you guys want with him?

04:13.955 --> 04:15.491
A bail bondsman was murdered.

04:16.891 --> 04:19.269
The guy with the office
behind the courthouse?

04:19.327 --> 04:20.772
You think Liriano is the perp?

04:20.829 --> 04:22.308
We're looking at all
of Ehrlich's clients

04:22.363 --> 04:23.774
who jumped bail in
the last two years.

04:23.832 --> 04:26.176
They all came back to court before
their bonds were forfeited.

04:26.234 --> 04:27.679
All except Liriano.

04:27.736 --> 04:29.238
He still has a week
to surrender.

04:29.304 --> 04:30.305
Yeah, right.

04:30.371 --> 04:32.146
What did he put up
to secure his bond?

04:32.273 --> 04:33.650
CURTIS: His mother put
up her restaurant.

04:33.708 --> 04:36.621
You think he killed Ehrlich so his
mom wouldn't lose the restaurant?

04:36.678 --> 04:39.215
Could be. You got any ideas
where we might find him?

04:39.280 --> 04:41.487
Sorry, guys. It was a
cookie-cutter buy-and-bust.

04:41.549 --> 04:43.722
I have 50 Oscar Lirianos.

04:43.785 --> 04:45.765
Let me know how it pans out.

04:49.724 --> 04:51.032
(CURTIS SPEAKING SPANISH)

04:51.092 --> 04:52.799
That looks delicious,
Mrs. Liriano.

04:52.861 --> 04:55.933
You know, I can't find a good cut
of oxtail in my neighborhood.

04:55.997 --> 04:58.568
I buy at Espino's
every morning on 14th.

04:59.134 --> 05:04.015
You don't come here to talk about my food.
Oscar's in Santo Domingo.

05:04.072 --> 05:07.076
Yeah, well, Oscar's about to
have a problem with his bail.

05:07.142 --> 05:08.883
He told me not to
worry about that.

05:08.943 --> 05:12.356
He doesn't come back to court,
you'll lose your restaurant.

05:12.413 --> 05:16.793
I tell a man from Mr. Ehrlich's
office, Oscar come back very soon.

05:16.851 --> 05:19.855
Maybe he's already back. Mr. Ehrlich
was shot two nights ago.

05:19.921 --> 05:20.991
He's dead.

05:21.055 --> 05:22.363
(EXCLAIMING IN SPANISH)

05:22.824 --> 05:24.997
Is that how Oscar solved your
problem with Mr. Ehrlich?

05:26.494 --> 05:31.170
No! No! My boy make a little
trouble, but he never do that!

05:31.266 --> 05:33.769
Mrs. Liriano, if you're
helping to hide your son,

05:33.835 --> 05:35.280
you're gonna be
in trouble, too.

05:35.336 --> 05:36.872
I work very hard.

05:36.938 --> 05:40.181
All I want to do is sell
my food and pay my bills.

05:42.844 --> 05:45.085
I wonder who she talked to
from Ehrlich's office.

05:45.146 --> 05:48.127
These bail bonds guys
use bounty hunters.

05:48.583 --> 05:53.123
Don't waste your energy. I'll have
Liriano back in your custody any day.

05:53.188 --> 05:54.633
A week at the most.

05:54.689 --> 05:56.760
Well, his mother claims he's
in the Dominican Republic.

05:56.825 --> 06:00.739
His mother? (LAUGHS) She's
a great cook, bad liar.

06:01.429 --> 06:03.067
Well, how do you know
she's lying?

06:03.131 --> 06:05.668
I've got over 30 hours
invested on this.

06:05.800 --> 06:08.337
If you guys collar him,
I'm in the hole.

06:08.403 --> 06:09.848
Hey, you're
in the hole already.

06:09.904 --> 06:12.783
The guy who pays your fee
took one in the head.

06:12.841 --> 06:14.252
Manny? When?

06:14.309 --> 06:15.686
Over the weekend.

06:15.743 --> 06:19.748
Damn. Nobody told me.
Nice guy, Manny.

06:22.750 --> 06:26.095
I've been sitting on
Liriano's girlfriend.

06:27.555 --> 06:31.059
Name, address, phone number.

06:31.125 --> 06:34.595
Josette Vega. What makes you think
she's in touch with Liriano?

06:34.662 --> 06:37.506
Every night she comes down
to the corner pay phone,

06:37.565 --> 06:39.511
9:00 p.m., like clockwork.

06:39.567 --> 06:42.013
Sometimes she dials out,
sometimes it rings.

06:42.070 --> 06:44.311
Were you on her last Saturday?

06:46.341 --> 06:50.118
She stood around for a while,
dialed out a couple times.

06:50.178 --> 06:52.556
As far as I can tell,
they never connected.

06:52.614 --> 06:54.252
Thanks.

06:55.216 --> 06:57.196
Well, we could put
a tap on the pay phone.

06:57.252 --> 07:00.358
9:00? I got a better idea.

07:00.622 --> 07:02.863
(PHONE RINGING)

07:03.191 --> 07:05.398
JOSETTE: Yeah? Yeah.
CURTIS: Josette Vega, please?

07:05.460 --> 07:08.407
This is Dr. Curtis from the
emergency room at Saint Vincent's.

07:08.463 --> 07:09.533
What happened?

07:09.597 --> 07:14.171
We have a Marta Liriano. Now, she
was struck by a bus this morning

07:14.235 --> 07:16.112
in front of Espino's
on 14th Street.

07:16.170 --> 07:17.171
Oh, my God.

07:17.238 --> 07:18.808
She's unconscious.

07:18.873 --> 07:21.786
We need permission from her
next of kin for surgery.

07:21.843 --> 07:23.220
Will she be okay?

07:23.278 --> 07:26.782
Well, not unless we can go in
and take a look at her kidneys.

07:26.848 --> 07:28.521
Let me go call her son.

07:29.684 --> 07:31.220
Bogey at 12:00.

07:33.888 --> 07:36.198
What do you got?
I'll get him.

07:42.897 --> 07:44.535
Hey, buddy, how you doing? Hey!

07:44.599 --> 07:46.636
How you doing? Remember me
from Hanratty's last night?

07:46.701 --> 07:48.339
What are you doing?
Remember, I was the guy

07:48.403 --> 07:50.576
drinking a Sea Breeze and
you said you liked my hat.

07:50.638 --> 07:52.481
What hat? Looked
like Frank Sinatra.

07:52.540 --> 07:55.020
Look, mister, you got me
confused with somebody else.

07:55.076 --> 07:57.022
I'm gonna show you
where I got the hat, man.

07:57.078 --> 08:00.685
Look, you nutcase!
You made me lose my phone.

08:00.748 --> 08:02.318
Well, don't you want the hat?

08:10.792 --> 08:11.827
It's Josette.

08:11.893 --> 08:14.737
Oscar's mother got hit by a bus.
She's in bad shape.

08:14.796 --> 08:15.900
MAN: Are you serious?

08:15.964 --> 08:18.240
JOSETTE: A doctor called me
right from the hospital.

08:18.299 --> 08:20.905
They need Oscar to give
permission for surgery.

08:21.002 --> 08:23.141
MAN: He said he'd be back
in half an hour.

08:23.271 --> 08:25.410
How long is he
staying here, anyway?

08:25.473 --> 08:27.578

08:47.862 --> 08:49.933
I gotta get to the hospital.
My mother's hurt real bad.

08:49.998 --> 08:52.569
Oh, yeah?
Say hello to Dr. Curtis.

08:52.634 --> 08:54.443

Stand up.

What are you looking at, huh?

08:57.538 --> 08:58.710
Nothing.

08:58.840 --> 09:00.012
You looking at that bag?

09:00.074 --> 09:01.747
Huh? Does this belong
to you?

09:01.809 --> 09:04.585
LIRIANO: Maybe.
I'll take that as a yes.

09:04.646 --> 09:06.148
Mind if I take a look inside?

09:06.214 --> 09:07.716
I say no, you're gonna
look anyway.

09:07.782 --> 09:08.954
Where's your gun?
What gun?

09:09.017 --> 09:11.054
The .38 you used to
tap Manny Ehrlich.

09:11.119 --> 09:13.998
Rey! Citibank opened up
a branch here.

09:14.055 --> 09:16.558

I want to call my lawyer.

09:16.624 --> 09:18.160
(BRISCOE LAUGHING)

09:18.760 --> 09:21.468
.38. This yours, too?

09:26.100 --> 09:29.570
I'm Arvin Baker, the attorney
on Mr. Liriano's drug case.

09:29.637 --> 09:31.378
It's a pleasure.

09:31.439 --> 09:32.918
You mind telling me
why homicide detectives

09:32.974 --> 09:34.954
are executing bench
warrants on drug cases?

09:35.009 --> 09:37.114
They think I shot Manny.
Who's Manny?

09:37.178 --> 09:39.055
Manny Ehrlich,
his bail bondsman.

09:39.113 --> 09:40.183
You gonna let them
put a body on me?

09:40.248 --> 09:41.852
Just shut up, Oscar.

09:41.916 --> 09:45.420
Or maybe your girlfriend with
the big mouth can fill us in.

09:46.254 --> 09:48.131
Why would Oscar kill that man?
CURTIS: He jumped bail.

09:48.189 --> 09:49.793
His mother was gonna
lose her restaurant.

09:49.857 --> 09:51.165
You got it all wrong.

09:51.225 --> 09:53.136
He was gonna turn
himself in, okay?

09:53.194 --> 09:54.901
So his mother wouldn't
lose the loncheria.

09:54.962 --> 09:56.100
He's playing you, Josette.

09:56.164 --> 09:58.770
He was gonna turn himself in.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.776
Soon as he paid the money
to his lawyer, Mr. Baker.

10:01.836 --> 10:03.372
What money?

10:04.238 --> 10:05.842
$50,000.

10:06.574 --> 10:09.578
We were gonna give him half on Saturday.
Mr. Baker never showed up.

10:09.644 --> 10:11.248
Come on, Josette.
You don't have 50 grand.

10:11.312 --> 10:15.055
We got half. Call my bank
if you don't believe me.

10:15.783 --> 10:17.194
Oscar couldn't turn himself in

10:17.251 --> 10:18.889
until he got all
the money for Mr. Baker.

10:18.953 --> 10:21.661
If he couldn't afford a lawyer,
the court would give him one.

10:21.722 --> 10:24.601
Free. He didn't
want a free lawyer.

10:25.193 --> 10:27.605
We were supposed
to get married.

10:27.662 --> 10:29.266
Mr. Baker said if
we paid the money,

10:29.330 --> 10:31.970
he'd make sure
Oscar didn't blow trial.

10:33.434 --> 10:36.608
Mr. Baker was going
to fix the case, okay?

10:43.778 --> 10:45.917
So Josette was
telling the truth.

10:45.980 --> 10:47.550
She had 24 grand
in her account.

10:47.615 --> 10:49.652
She withdrew it on
Saturday morning.

10:49.717 --> 10:53.221
And Liriano was gonna pay it to
Baker on Saturday to fix his case?

10:53.287 --> 10:56.234
Well, Liriano had $24,000 in
his bag when we picked him up.

10:56.290 --> 10:58.395
The IUDs from Ehrlich's
home phone on Saturday.

10:58.459 --> 11:00.496
Three calls to Arvin Baker.

11:00.561 --> 11:02.268
Baker was Ehrlich's
late appointment?

11:02.330 --> 11:05.641
Baker didn't show up to collect the
money from Liriano on Saturday.

11:05.700 --> 11:08.146
Yeah. Maybe he was too busy
shooting Ehrlich.

11:08.202 --> 11:10.011
It's a theory.

11:10.071 --> 11:12.745
We'll hold Liriano on the warrant
while you figure it out.

11:12.807 --> 11:13.945
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

11:16.911 --> 11:19.152
Four cops with
their heads together.

11:19.480 --> 11:21.050
You got a murder charge or not?

11:21.115 --> 11:24.426
Not yet, Mr. Baker, but
you'll be the first to know.

11:29.824 --> 11:30.962
ROSS: Arvin Baker?
Never heard of him.

11:31.025 --> 11:34.939
The defendant's girlfriend says he was
gonna make the case go away for 50 grand.

11:34.996 --> 11:35.997
What kind of case?

11:36.063 --> 11:37.974
Drugs. A street-level
hand-to-hand.

11:38.032 --> 11:41.070
For no-name counsel,
that rates a $10,000 fee tops.

11:41.135 --> 11:42.944
Maybe he's just trying to
take his client for a ride.

11:43.004 --> 11:45.177
All we know is we got a lot
of pieces that don't fit.

11:45.239 --> 11:46.980
We got a lawyer
and a bail bondsman

11:47.041 --> 11:49.248
exchanging phone calls
on a Saturday night.

11:49.310 --> 11:50.846
Next thing you know,
the bondsman's dead.

11:50.912 --> 11:53.984
And the same lawyer's squeezing
50 grand from his client.

11:54.048 --> 11:55.425
It's all gotta be connected.

11:56.417 --> 11:59.557
Pin down Baker's whereabouts.
I'll see what I can turn up.

12:04.425 --> 12:08.464
He's lived here about a year. Between
you and me, guy's got an attitude.

12:08.529 --> 12:10.270
We're interested in
last Saturday night.

12:10.331 --> 12:13.335
Lets his girlfriend's mutt urinate
right here on the canopy posts.

12:13.401 --> 12:14.709
Then I gotta hose it down.

12:14.769 --> 12:16.840
Fascinating.
Saturday night.

12:16.904 --> 12:19.748
The girlfriend comes by with the
lap-rat, Mr. Baker's not home.

12:19.807 --> 12:21.150
What time was that?

12:21.209 --> 12:22.745
I make it around 9:00.

12:22.810 --> 12:26.155
'Course, it's my fault
he doesn't leave her a key.

12:26.214 --> 12:28.490
She stews for a while
in the lobby.

12:28.549 --> 12:31.029
Mr. Baker comes in
a half-hour later.

12:31.085 --> 12:33.759
Guy's name is Manny Ehrlich.
He ever come by?

12:33.821 --> 12:37.064
Yeah. Mr. Baker left him
an envelope a few times.

12:37.992 --> 12:41.804
ROSS: These are Baker's criminal
cases over the past two years.

12:41.862 --> 12:45.867
Thirty-five, 40 names.
Business can't be that bad.

12:45.933 --> 12:48.607
His conviction rates are a
lot lower than average.

12:48.669 --> 12:49.909
Maybe all his clients
are innocent.

12:49.971 --> 12:53.009
Or he's fixing cases,
like Josette said.

12:53.074 --> 12:56.920
Read me the names of Baker's clients
who had bonds out with Ehrlich.

12:58.446 --> 13:00.426
Gregory Billups.

13:01.349 --> 13:03.659
Never indicted.
Charges dismissed.

13:03.718 --> 13:05.425
CURTIS: Geraldine Smithson.

13:07.989 --> 13:10.526
Charges dismissed on
a speedy trial motion.

13:10.625 --> 13:12.036
Corey Black.

13:13.761 --> 13:15.570
Charges reduced.
Probation.

13:15.630 --> 13:18.668
Ehrlich's referrals come with
satisfaction guaranteed.

13:18.733 --> 13:22.772
Except for Delmore Walton.
He's doing 6-to-12 upstate.

13:22.837 --> 13:24.748
Maybe he couldn't
meet Baker's price.

13:25.706 --> 13:27.413
I'll ask him.

13:32.647 --> 13:35.184
Nice of you to
bring me the smokes.

13:38.486 --> 13:40.124
Join me?

13:40.187 --> 13:42.064
Thanks, I don't.

13:42.123 --> 13:45.400
I need to ask you some
questions about Arvin Baker.

13:48.896 --> 13:50.739
Why don't you
slip off that jacket?

13:51.766 --> 13:53.609
I'm a little chilly.

13:54.535 --> 13:56.481
Here I am thinking it's hot.

13:56.537 --> 14:00.485
Well, think again. Maybe I can
find some other way to help you.

14:02.310 --> 14:04.381
Letter to the parole board.

14:04.445 --> 14:05.856
I can do that.

14:07.548 --> 14:08.652
Okay.

14:10.851 --> 14:14.230
Now, what can I tell you
about my crooked-ass lawyer?

14:14.288 --> 14:15.961
You can tell me why
you call him that.

14:18.426 --> 14:20.804
Baker said he was gonna
sell me a walk-away.

14:21.929 --> 14:24.170
Let me make sure I
understand you, Mr. Walton.

14:24.231 --> 14:26.233
Arvin Baker offered
to fix your case?

14:26.734 --> 14:29.442
Yeah. I paid him 25K.

14:29.503 --> 14:31.005
But you're here.

14:31.305 --> 14:33.114
The man ripped me off.

14:34.742 --> 14:37.313
This got anything to do with Manny
Ehrlich contacting my brother?

14:39.714 --> 14:40.954
What did he want?

14:54.695 --> 14:57.471
He was asking about
my agreement with Baker.

14:58.466 --> 15:00.207
Ehrlich's trying
to shake him down.

15:00.368 --> 15:01.676
Why do you say that?

15:01.736 --> 15:04.376
Ehrlich told me if I told
him what I just told you,

15:04.438 --> 15:06.850
he'd get me a refund
on that cheap bastard.

15:09.543 --> 15:10.749
Ehrlich's dead.

15:11.345 --> 15:12.653
(SIGHS)

15:13.914 --> 15:15.860
My luck.

15:18.119 --> 15:19.496
Hey!
ROSS: Hi.

15:19.553 --> 15:21.226
So, where have you
been hiding out?

15:21.288 --> 15:24.269
You know the routine. Punch in,
punch out, get home for Katie.

15:24.325 --> 15:26.566
You should come to Gallagher's
some Friday after work.

15:26.627 --> 15:27.970
There's someone
you should meet.

15:28.029 --> 15:30.942
Oh! Give it up, Charlie.

15:30.998 --> 15:32.033
How are Lisa and the kids?

15:32.099 --> 15:35.637
Great. So who've you
got on Oscar Liriano?

15:35.703 --> 15:37.205
I'm supervising
the investigation.

15:37.271 --> 15:39.148
I had him first on
the drug indictment.

15:39.206 --> 15:40.685
It's McCoy's call.

15:40.741 --> 15:42.948
You owe me on the Camacho case.

15:43.010 --> 15:44.421
Don't ace me out this time.

15:44.478 --> 15:46.321
I'll do my best.

15:47.615 --> 15:49.822
Baker solicited bribes
from his clients.

15:49.884 --> 15:52.057
Ehrlich found out and wanted
a piece of the action.

15:52.119 --> 15:55.362
I'm pretty sure it got him
killed and Baker's the shooter.

15:55.422 --> 15:57.868
Can we do any better
than pretty sure?

15:57.925 --> 16:00.098
There's no physical evidence
linking Baker to the murder.

16:00.161 --> 16:01.868
What about his criminal cases?

16:01.929 --> 16:05.433
Are you only pretty sure
that they were fixed?

16:06.033 --> 16:09.480
Baker's results are just too miraculous
to draw any other conclusion.

16:09.537 --> 16:12.984
If it's true, he had to have help
from somebody on the inside.

16:13.040 --> 16:15.543
At least a dozen ways a defense
lawyer can beat a case.

16:15.609 --> 16:17.748
Baker used most of them.

16:17.812 --> 16:19.849
I checked our database
to find a common thread.

16:19.914 --> 16:22.724
Judges, cops, A.D.A.s,
nothing jumped out.

16:22.783 --> 16:24.091
Might even be a clerk.

16:24.151 --> 16:27.655
Murder is one thing, but corruption
in the system, I want names.

16:28.756 --> 16:31.293
Well, Liriano's
the first domino.

16:31.358 --> 16:33.304
If we can get him
to flip on Baker...

16:33.360 --> 16:36.432
Can't go anywhere near Liriano
as long as Baker represents him.

16:36.497 --> 16:40.639
Well, find some way
to make the dominoes fall.

16:44.138 --> 16:45.708
We could set a trap for Baker.

16:48.809 --> 16:52.313
Baker thinks we're investigating
Liriano for Ehrlich's murder.

16:52.379 --> 16:54.188
If we go ahead and
charge Liriano...

16:54.248 --> 16:56.956
You just said that
Baker killed Ehrlich.

16:57.017 --> 16:59.497
Our prosecution of
Liriano would be a ruse.

16:59.553 --> 17:02.796
A sting to gather information against
Baker and trace the corruption.

17:03.757 --> 17:05.395
A phony prosecution?

17:05.459 --> 17:06.869
The Feds have used this.

17:06.926 --> 17:08.599
We ask the courts
to assign a lawyer

17:08.662 --> 17:10.300
to represent Liriano
behind the scenes,

17:10.396 --> 17:12.809
a shadow counsel, and we
ask Liriano to play along.

17:12.867 --> 17:16.144
He pays the bribe, we follow the
money to Baker's inside connection.

17:16.203 --> 17:17.272
It could work, Adam.

17:17.338 --> 17:19.682
Don't convince me,
convince a judge.

17:20.273 --> 17:23.278
The Liriano case traces back to Charlie Harmon.
I'll bring him in the loop.

17:23.344 --> 17:25.186
No. You ride this case.

17:25.246 --> 17:28.454
ROSS: If we do anything out of the
ordinary, Baker will sniff it out.

17:28.516 --> 17:29.688
Harmon's never
handled a homicide.

17:29.750 --> 17:30.888
I'll second chair.

17:30.951 --> 17:32.157
I'll fill him in
on what we're doing.

17:32.219 --> 17:33.755
ADAM: No.

17:34.455 --> 17:38.767
Until we know who's involved,
we keep Mr. Harmon in the dark.

17:47.601 --> 17:52.072
The warrant against Mr. Liriano is vacated.
This matter was marked ready?

17:52.139 --> 17:53.243
Yes, Judge.

17:53.307 --> 17:55.719
JUDGE: Then the defendant
is remanded. May 1st.

17:59.246 --> 18:00.987
This one's ours, fellas.

18:01.048 --> 18:02.322
You guys again?

18:02.383 --> 18:03.657
Oscar Liriano,

18:03.717 --> 18:05.754
you're under arrest for the
murder of Manny Ehrlich.

18:05.820 --> 18:07.356
What?
Nice and loose this time.

18:07.421 --> 18:09.059
You have the right
to remain silent.

18:09.123 --> 18:11.831
Anything you do say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

18:14.662 --> 18:16.664
You propose to
charge Mr. Liriano,

18:16.730 --> 18:19.210
although you know
he is innocent,

18:19.266 --> 18:22.611
and have me appoint a lawyer
to advise him in secret,

18:22.670 --> 18:24.980
and then go forward
with a bogus prosecution

18:25.039 --> 18:27.019
without telling
the assigned judge.

18:27.107 --> 18:29.781
All subject to
Mr. Liriano's approval.

18:29.844 --> 18:32.484
Isn't this going to require the
police to fabricate testimony?

18:32.546 --> 18:33.718
JACK: If it gets that far.

18:33.781 --> 18:37.092
We will have to dummy-up a ballistics
report which says Liriano's gun

18:37.151 --> 18:38.926
is a probable match
for the murder weapon.

18:39.019 --> 18:40.828
Adam Schiff must
be getting senile.

18:40.888 --> 18:43.630
Do you have any precedent
for this scheme?

18:43.691 --> 18:46.467
It was used in federal court.
And there's People v. Stewart.

18:47.361 --> 18:50.740
If you think I am gonna sit here
holding a live hand grenade,

18:50.798 --> 18:52.004
you're very much mistaken.

18:52.066 --> 18:54.137
If it blows up, blame me.

18:55.002 --> 18:57.881
Cases are being fixed
in this courthouse.

19:00.240 --> 19:03.187
I'll assign David Baez from
the Hispanic Defense Project

19:03.244 --> 19:05.690
as Mr. Liriano's
shadow counsel.

19:05.746 --> 19:07.589
I just hope the
Court of Appeals

19:07.648 --> 19:10.219
doesn't have all our
heads on a platter.

19:11.085 --> 19:12.758
You people are crazy. Let
them finish, Mr. Liriano.

19:12.820 --> 19:15.699
No, you let them finish!
Mr. Baker's my lawyer.

19:15.756 --> 19:17.736
JACK: Baker can't
help you anymore.

19:17.791 --> 19:19.964
You want to walk on the drug case,
that's what we're offering.

19:20.027 --> 19:21.904
And it won't cost you 50 grand.

19:21.962 --> 19:24.067
This some new way to get
framed on a murder rap?

19:24.131 --> 19:27.340
The murder prosecution
is phony, Mr. Liriano.

19:27.401 --> 19:29.677
They're only doing it
to investigate Mr. Baker.

19:29.737 --> 19:31.478
You want to talk to the judge?

19:32.306 --> 19:37.051
Look, suppose I front for you.
How long I'm in here for?

19:37.111 --> 19:38.613
Three months tops.

19:38.679 --> 19:41.216
Or you can do 10 years
on your drug case.

19:42.116 --> 19:44.118
Everybody's gonna
think I capped the guy.

19:44.184 --> 19:46.027
You can explain it
when it's over.

19:46.086 --> 19:48.088
Or you don't explain it.

19:50.324 --> 19:53.134
Yeah. I like that.

19:54.495 --> 19:58.671
Tanya Gross made Deputy Bureau Chief.
She was class of '87.

19:58.732 --> 20:01.303
Special projects, a dumping
ground for has-beens.

20:01.368 --> 20:06.283
Well, maybe I'd have an office with a door.
And the bump would be nice.

20:06.807 --> 20:09.083
For those of us who
care about such things.

20:09.743 --> 20:12.587
I got one of these.
Mine's all blue.

20:12.646 --> 20:14.922
Sophie has a virtual pet now.

20:15.649 --> 20:17.390
This from the man who
wouldn't take an exam

20:17.451 --> 20:19.931
without h is
G u m by wristwatch.

20:20.588 --> 20:22.295
Thanks for coming
through with McCoy.

20:22.423 --> 20:24.130
It's no big deal.

20:24.591 --> 20:26.571
How do you think Baker will
counter our ballistics evidence?

20:26.627 --> 20:28.231
This'll never go to trial.

20:28.328 --> 20:31.241
Liriano will plead out if Baker
can't get the gun tossed.

20:31.298 --> 20:33.539
It's nice when your first
murder's a slam dunk.

20:33.600 --> 20:36.672
Sometimes the ones that look
easy bite you in the ass.

20:39.540 --> 20:42.077
Motion to suppress
Liriano's gun.

20:44.144 --> 20:47.318
Baker's attacking the police
search of Liriano's gym bag.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.593
Liriano phoned Baker yesterday

20:51.652 --> 20:54.189
to ask him about
the arrangement.

20:54.855 --> 20:56.061
Baker quoted a figure.

20:56.123 --> 20:57.193
How much?

20:58.225 --> 20:59.932
$90,000.

21:00.260 --> 21:01.796
He jacked up the price.

21:01.862 --> 21:03.170
Two cases.

21:03.230 --> 21:04.402
Or he got greedier.

21:04.465 --> 21:05.535
JACK: I want this on tape.

21:05.599 --> 21:09.479
Have Liriano sign a consent to
bug the counsel room at Rikers.

21:09.536 --> 21:12.073
Tell him to ask Baker
for a face-to-face.

21:12.139 --> 21:15.951
We'll need an order from Judge
Goldman to show Corrections.

21:16.009 --> 21:18.546
It's imperative that he get
Baker to spell out the details.

21:18.612 --> 21:21.286
I don't want this coming back
looking like a retainer meeting.

21:22.516 --> 21:23.824
I'll tell him.

21:25.119 --> 21:27.099
Baker filed his
suppression motion.

21:28.355 --> 21:31.996
If the gun's suppressed, he'll move
to get the indictment dismissed.

21:32.059 --> 21:33.094
Who's the judge?

21:33.160 --> 21:34.161
Allen Denham.

21:34.228 --> 21:36.606
He's presided over
six of Baker's cases.

21:36.663 --> 21:38.700
Let's keep an eye on him.

21:40.668 --> 21:42.773
So why'd it go to 90?

21:42.836 --> 21:46.477
This ain't Macy's, Oscar.
You have two cases now,

21:47.875 --> 21:49.286
one of which is for murder.

21:49.343 --> 21:51.345
So let me ask you
something, Mr. Baker.

21:51.412 --> 21:55.121
If I get you this money, how can
I be sure you get the results?

21:55.182 --> 21:56.286
That's my problem.

21:56.350 --> 21:58.387
Papa, it's a lot of money.

21:58.452 --> 21:59.453
If it's gonna be a problem...

21:59.520 --> 22:03.366
I have a friend. Okay? He'll
take care of everything.

22:03.424 --> 22:04.664
We're talking a walk?

22:04.725 --> 22:06.534
You'll be out in two weeks.

22:07.161 --> 22:10.199
Tops. Free and clear.

22:12.266 --> 22:13.267
All right.

22:14.902 --> 22:15.903
You come by my
mother's restaurant.

22:15.969 --> 22:18.210
That's all I can stomach.

22:18.272 --> 22:19.717
There's more.

22:19.773 --> 22:22.913
Baker picked up the bribe money
and went to Merchants Bank.

22:22.976 --> 22:24.580
JACK: He put it in
a safe deposit.

22:24.678 --> 22:27.659
The police searched it
later and found 200 grand,

22:27.714 --> 22:29.193
along with Liriano's 90.

22:29.450 --> 22:31.521
Any idea who Baker's friend is?

22:32.753 --> 22:34.289
We're looking at Judge Denham.

22:34.421 --> 22:35.957
Terrific.

22:38.625 --> 22:42.038
Liriano doesn't answer the door
right away, so ESU breaks us in.

22:42.096 --> 22:45.305
When you're on the stand, make sure
you say you identified yourselves.

22:45.365 --> 22:47.174
Right.

22:47.968 --> 22:49.003
So, we go in.

22:49.069 --> 22:51.606
Liriano's sitting on the
couch, talking on the phone.

22:51.672 --> 22:53.413
Now, while Rey's
hooking him up,

22:53.474 --> 22:55.715
I notice he keeps glancing
over at this gym bag...

22:55.776 --> 22:58.484
When you say glanced,
how many times?

22:58.545 --> 23:01.458
Two or three, but it was more
the way he was doing it.

23:01.515 --> 23:03.722
So, is the bag
close enough to grab?

23:04.918 --> 23:06.955
It'd be a dive
from where he was.

23:07.187 --> 23:09.224
Still in the
grab-able area.

23:11.291 --> 23:13.567
So anyway,
Rey's got him handcuffed.

23:13.627 --> 23:15.834
Now, he tells me it's his bag.

23:15.896 --> 23:17.466
Well, as soon as
I picked it up, I felt...

23:17.531 --> 23:20.603
The suspect is cuffed before
you picked up the bag?

23:20.667 --> 23:25.207
Let me rephrase that. I'd say he was
in the process of being cuffed.

23:25.272 --> 23:27.684
Don't embellish, Detective.

23:27.741 --> 23:29.414
I don't mind
a little embellishing.

23:29.476 --> 23:32.821
Well, my cops
don't testi-lie.

23:35.315 --> 23:37.454
It's his case.

23:38.218 --> 23:41.665
Okay, so I walked
over to the bag,

23:41.722 --> 23:43.861
I gave it a nudge with my foot,

23:43.924 --> 23:45.198
and it opened up a little bit,

23:45.259 --> 23:46.499
and that's when I saw the cash.

23:46.560 --> 23:48.562
So, the cash wasn't
in plain view?

23:48.629 --> 23:50.040
BRISCOE: What do you
want here?

23:51.732 --> 23:53.302
Not exactly.

23:55.435 --> 23:58.973
Okay, 9:30 tomorrow,
part 24.

23:59.039 --> 24:00.518
BRISCOE: Right.

24:03.143 --> 24:06.124
You know, Liriano's
gun is the only thing

24:06.180 --> 24:07.784
that puts him at
the murder scene.

24:07.848 --> 24:11.523
Thanks to your waffling cop, it's
probably gonna get suppressed.

24:11.585 --> 24:14.725
So play on the fact that things
transpired in a matter of seconds.

24:14.788 --> 24:18.497
Well, you know,
I play it straight, Jamie.

24:20.160 --> 24:23.539
This is a murder trial,
not some $10 hand-to-hand.

24:23.597 --> 24:25.076
You don't blow it on semantics.

24:25.132 --> 24:26.941
Why you fighting me on this?

24:28.669 --> 24:30.171
I just don't want
to see it get tossed

24:30.237 --> 24:32.012
because the police
did their job.

24:32.072 --> 24:34.018
It's your first homicide.

24:35.609 --> 24:37.213
Well, thank you.

24:47.020 --> 24:48.556
Where's Katie tonight?

24:49.456 --> 24:51.800
Neal took her to
the Liberty game.

24:53.727 --> 24:55.900
Those look like
narcotics jackets.

24:55.963 --> 24:59.172
Just some background investigation
I've been putting off.

25:02.636 --> 25:05.845
The closed Baker dismissals
I ordered from archives.

25:06.874 --> 25:08.979
Anything interesting?

25:09.676 --> 25:12.987
Something that didn't
turn up on our database.

25:13.046 --> 25:16.653
Charlie Harmon's name is
somewhere on every one of these.

25:16.717 --> 25:19.664
He was in the complaint room, he
answered the speedy trial motion.

25:19.720 --> 25:22.030
Could be a coincidence.

25:22.089 --> 25:24.831
He was assigned to special narcotics
from Brooklyn 10 years ago.

25:24.892 --> 25:27.168
He's handled
thousands of cases.

25:28.395 --> 25:31.308
When we were prepping
Briscoe for the hearing,

25:31.365 --> 25:33.311
Charlie was coaching him
to be a defense witness.

25:34.234 --> 25:38.410
Maybe he was just reminding
Briscoe not to overcompensate.

25:38.472 --> 25:40.679
You or I would have smoothed
over the rough edges.

25:40.741 --> 25:43.347
Charlie was
prepping him to fail.

25:44.277 --> 25:46.257
Go home, Jamie.

25:46.313 --> 25:49.226
The hearing's tomorrow. You're not
gonna prove anything in here.

25:51.652 --> 25:55.395
I was hoping to prove
I'm wrong about Charlie.

25:55.989 --> 25:58.435
My money's still
on Judge Denham.

26:05.432 --> 26:08.470
As the suspect was being
restrained by my partner,

26:08.535 --> 26:11.277
he looked over at a gym bag
at the foot of the bed.

26:11.338 --> 26:12.544
What did you do?

26:12.606 --> 26:16.019
BRISCOE: I asked him if it was his
bag and if I could look inside it.

26:16.076 --> 26:18.317
He didn't object,
so I opened it up,

26:18.378 --> 26:21.655
and first I found the money
and then the gun.

26:21.715 --> 26:23.319
Nothing further.

26:25.419 --> 26:30.027
Detective, you say my client gave you
permission to look inside his bag

26:30.824 --> 26:32.633
even though he knew
there was a gun inside.

26:32.693 --> 26:36.368
I don't know what he knew, but he
didn't object when I asked him.

26:36.430 --> 26:39.968
BAKER: Didn't he tell you, "if I
say no, you'll just look anyway"?

26:40.033 --> 26:42.172
Something like that.

26:42.235 --> 26:46.308
And when you first noticed the
gym bag, where was Mr. Liriano?

26:46.373 --> 26:47.408
BRISCOE: With my partner.

26:47.474 --> 26:49.715
Handcuffed and being guarded
by Detective Curtis?

26:49.776 --> 26:50.777
BRISCOE: Yes.

26:50.844 --> 26:52.016
BAKER: So Mr. Liriano
couldn't possibly

26:52.079 --> 26:53.820
have grabbed the weapon
from the bag?

26:55.482 --> 26:56.859
I guess not.

26:58.552 --> 27:01.055
Nothing further.

27:01.588 --> 27:06.867
You may step down, Detective.
Any more witnesses, Mr. Harmon?

27:08.829 --> 27:10.399
The People rest.

27:10.864 --> 27:13.344
BAKER: Your Honor, the police
had no legitimate reason

27:13.400 --> 27:16.870
to conduct a warrantless
search of my client's bag.

27:16.937 --> 27:20.407
No explicit consent, no threat
to the officers' safety.

27:20.474 --> 27:24.445
The police were investigating a homicide.
The defendant was in hiding.

27:24.511 --> 27:27.515
They had every reason to assume
there was evidence in the bag.

27:27.581 --> 27:31.119
But they arrested Mr. Liriano on a
bench warrant from the drug case

27:31.184 --> 27:35.599
before they uncovered any evidence
against him on the homicide.

27:35.655 --> 27:39.034
If Detective Briscoe had a hunch
there was evidence in that bag,

27:39.092 --> 27:41.402
he should have obtained
a search warrant.

27:43.897 --> 27:46.173
Rebuttal, Mr. Harmon?

27:47.234 --> 27:48.941
We've made our argument.

27:49.302 --> 27:50.679
DENHAM: Very well.

27:51.004 --> 27:52.847
All evidence seized
in the gym bag,

27:52.906 --> 27:55.648
including the gun,
is suppressed.

27:55.709 --> 28:00.055
Your Honor, I'm moving to dismiss
the indictment against Mr. Liriano.

28:00.113 --> 28:01.615
The People cannot
connect him to the murder

28:01.681 --> 28:03.820
without the evidence
from the gym bag.

28:04.084 --> 28:08.624
Mr. Harmon?
Going once, Mr. Harmon.

28:12.759 --> 28:14.636
I move to recall
Detective Briscoe.

28:14.694 --> 28:16.503
Judge, he can't do that.

28:16.563 --> 28:20.739
He can if I say he can.
Step up, Detective.

28:22.102 --> 28:24.082
You're still under oath.

28:34.748 --> 28:37.092
Detective, the night
Mr. Ehrlich was murdered,

28:37.150 --> 28:40.029
was there any evidence
a robbery had taken place?

28:40.087 --> 28:43.762
Well, let's see. His desk
had been rifled through,

28:43.824 --> 28:46.498
and we found
a lockbox on the floor,

28:46.560 --> 28:48.039
the kind of thing
you keep money in.

28:48.095 --> 28:50.939
It was jimmied?
The hinges were broken?

28:50.997 --> 28:53.238
BRISCOE: Right, and there
was some loose change.

28:53.300 --> 28:54.802
HARMON: Indicating
what to you?

28:54.868 --> 28:58.077
BRISCOE: The box had been pried open
and that some cash had been removed.

28:58.138 --> 29:00.880
When you arrested
Mr. Liriano,

29:00.941 --> 29:03.046
what drew your attention
to his gym bag?

29:03.109 --> 29:04.952
Like I said, he looked at it.

29:05.011 --> 29:11.257
But when you looked at the bag up
close, did you notice anything?

29:17.591 --> 29:18.592
Detective?

29:21.194 --> 29:23.800
Yes. I saw a roll
of bills inside it.

29:23.864 --> 29:25.036
HARMON: Where?

29:25.098 --> 29:26.236
BRISCOE: Right on top.

29:26.299 --> 29:28.438
So when you saw a roll of money

29:28.501 --> 29:31.243
in Mr. Liriano's bag,
what did you think?

29:31.304 --> 29:32.806
I thought it might be the money

29:32.872 --> 29:34.852
from the robbery
of Manny Ehrlich.

29:34.908 --> 29:36.717
HARMON: I ask you
to reconsider, Your Honor.

29:36.776 --> 29:39.814
The officer saw what he thought
was the proceeds from a robbery.

29:40.947 --> 29:43.359
It justifies the search.

29:45.318 --> 29:47.229
He's right, Mr. Baker.

29:47.821 --> 29:50.563
I'm reversing my decision,
suppression is denied.

29:53.293 --> 29:55.136
First I thought Harmon
was gonna tank it.

29:55.195 --> 29:56.868
Then I didn't know
what he was doing.

29:56.930 --> 29:59.706
Hello? Jamie? We won.

29:59.766 --> 30:02.474
Did we? Take me to
the property clerk.

30:04.037 --> 30:07.382
Intake of the property
was the day after the murder.

30:07.440 --> 30:09.351
Cop or D.A. is the only
one authorized to sign out.

30:09.409 --> 30:12.288
Well, who signed this out?

30:12.345 --> 30:15.417
Nobody. This baby hasn't left the
shelf since the day she came in.

30:15.482 --> 30:17.155
Let's have a look.

30:19.953 --> 30:23.799
Well, there's my sign and
seal, and there's Latent's.

30:23.857 --> 30:25.359
All right, I need to see it.

30:25.425 --> 30:28.338
Wait a second, wait a second, wait a second.
You're not supposed to unseal it

30:28.395 --> 30:30.033
till it goes to court.

30:30.096 --> 30:31.302
Cut it.

30:38.338 --> 30:40.648
Harmon. You son of a bitch.

30:44.177 --> 30:46.657
He knew about the broken
hinges on Ehrlich's lockbox.

30:46.713 --> 30:49.091
So he did his homework. JACK: It
wasn't in the police reports, Adam.

30:49.149 --> 30:50.924
ROSS: And Harmon never
looked for himself.

30:51.051 --> 30:52.860
There's only one way
he could've known.

30:52.919 --> 30:55.832
We thought we had a crooked D.A.
Now we have a murderer.

31:10.971 --> 31:14.214
Well, that's certainly one
way to pad your statistics.

31:14.274 --> 31:17.016
A lawyer beats too many
cases, have him arrested.

31:18.812 --> 31:21.292
We don't mind losing
the old-fashioned way.

31:21.348 --> 31:22.827
It's gonna be a problem...

31:22.882 --> 31:26.455
I have a friend. Okay? He'll
take care of everything.

31:26.519 --> 31:28.692
Are we talking a walk?

31:28.755 --> 31:31.827
You'll be out
in two weeks. Tops.

31:35.528 --> 31:40.671
That was my sales pitch. It's
easy to take that out of context.

31:41.501 --> 31:44.209
Maybe we took these
out of context, too.

31:46.039 --> 31:47.848
You taking the money.

31:49.809 --> 31:51.186
You entering the bank.

31:53.313 --> 31:55.224
Sol like my fees in cash.

31:55.281 --> 32:00.321
Greg Billups, Geraldine Smithson,
Igor Navarez, Corey Black.

32:00.387 --> 32:03.391
JACK: Delmore Walton's ready
to testify against you.

32:07.427 --> 32:08.963
So, what are you offering?

32:09.129 --> 32:11.336
Depends what you have to say.

32:14.501 --> 32:16.174
It was Harmon's idea.

32:18.304 --> 32:20.875
Do you think I would approach an A.D.A.
with something like that?

32:20.940 --> 32:22.317
So what happened with
Liriano's hearing?

32:22.375 --> 32:25.185
Harmon got cold feet. Something
about you put him off.

32:26.679 --> 32:28.920
JACK: Any other lawyers
bribing Harmon?

32:29.682 --> 32:31.320
Not that I know of, no.

32:31.384 --> 32:33.193
It could help you
with the murder charges.

32:37.791 --> 32:40.635
I was nowhere near
that bail bonds office.

32:41.494 --> 32:43.838
Well, let's hear it.

32:48.134 --> 32:51.274
Manny Ehrlich and I had
a little something going.

32:51.338 --> 32:54.876
He'd send me a case,
I'd show my appreciation.

32:54.941 --> 32:57.888
He'd had no idea what
I had going with Harmon.

32:58.711 --> 33:01.954
Manny sniffed it out. He
called me that Saturday night,

33:02.015 --> 33:03.892
told me he wanted a full
share of all the pay-offs

33:03.950 --> 33:06.396
if it was a case
that he referred.

33:07.654 --> 33:10.225
And Harmon went to negotiate.

33:13.193 --> 33:16.640
The next morning I read about
Manny in The Daily News.

33:19.265 --> 33:20.505
We can't convict
Harmon of murder

33:20.567 --> 33:22.911
on accomplice testimony alone.

33:22.969 --> 33:24.505
We need corroboration.

33:24.571 --> 33:26.744
We can't just wait for
it to drop in our laps.

33:26.806 --> 33:28.479
If Harmon finds out
Baker's in the Tombs,

33:28.541 --> 33:31.351
he might run. We should
pick him up tonight.

33:31.411 --> 33:35.086
You know his kids. We can arrest
him when he shows up for work.

33:35.148 --> 33:38.527
Miss Ross is right. The sooner
we get him talking to us,

33:38.585 --> 33:42.055
the quicker I find out how
much this infects my office.

33:44.290 --> 33:46.702
I'll go with
Briscoe and Curtis.

33:50.697 --> 33:52.938
I'll be home
late tonight, okay?

33:53.500 --> 33:55.605
I have some work to
do with these men.

33:56.036 --> 33:57.913
All right, time to go.

34:03.943 --> 34:07.015
Lisa. Call Ed Richter.

34:09.516 --> 34:13.089
Hey, hugs!
Come on. Hugs. Come on.

34:16.922 --> 34:18.163
See you.

34:20.460 --> 34:24.704
You couldn't wait till tomorrow?
You're despicable.

34:26.533 --> 34:28.945
Charlie didn't
leave us a choice.

34:31.170 --> 34:33.581
You're making a mistake.

34:33.639 --> 34:37.246
Arvin Baker confessed
to your case-fixing venture.

34:37.710 --> 34:40.884
The corruption ties you
into Ehrlich's murder.

34:42.215 --> 34:44.991
Jamie. How long have
you known me?

34:45.784 --> 34:48.129
You killed Ehrlich to
keep him from talking.

34:48.688 --> 34:50.964
Murder one.
RICHTER: It's a reach.

34:51.024 --> 34:52.400
We can talk about
second-degree

34:52.458 --> 34:54.438
if he briefs us on
every case he fixed.

34:54.494 --> 34:55.905
What's the recommendation?

34:55.962 --> 34:57.168
JACK: 25-to-life.

34:57.363 --> 34:59.639
I'll throw in the
corruption charges.

34:59.699 --> 35:03.272
RICHTER: That's a big number, Jack.
All you have is Baker.

35:05.371 --> 35:07.783
The Liriano case was a sting.

35:09.509 --> 35:12.956
Harmon hung himself on the hinges
of Manny Ehrlich's lockbox.

35:13.012 --> 35:17.654
Jamie, you... You sat there.
You set me up.

35:18.184 --> 35:21.393
Your key evidence is based
on a phony prosecution?

35:23.289 --> 35:26.065
You have a serious problem.
We're moving to suppress.

35:32.298 --> 35:35.472
Mr. McCoy's tactics are
unacceptable, Your Honor.

35:35.535 --> 35:38.379
He fraudulently
prosecuted Mr. Liriano

35:38.438 --> 35:40.315
for a murder he didn't commit.

35:40.373 --> 35:44.822
There was no fraud. Mr. Liriano
agreed to participate.

35:44.878 --> 35:46.858
We obtained judicial approval.

35:46.913 --> 35:47.983
From?

35:48.047 --> 35:49.321
Judge Goldman.

35:49.382 --> 35:51.328
Goldman.
I should have guessed.

35:52.385 --> 35:55.559
Were the other judges on this bogus
case aware of what was going on?

35:55.622 --> 35:56.828
No, they were not.

35:56.890 --> 35:58.563
So we were your personal dupes.

35:58.625 --> 36:01.071
We had no idea where we were
gonna find the corruption.

36:01.127 --> 36:03.505
The integrity of the investigation
had to be protected.

36:03.563 --> 36:06.407
RICHTER: Integrity,
Your Honor? A fake hearing?

36:06.466 --> 36:08.173
Phony police reports?

36:08.234 --> 36:09.838
It was Mr. Richter's client,

36:09.903 --> 36:13.248
Assistant District Attorney Charles
Harmon, who was undermining the system.

36:13.306 --> 36:16.617
Mr. McCoy, wasn't there some
other avenue of investigation?

36:17.811 --> 36:22.157
Lawyers were fixing cases. This
was the only avenue available.

36:22.215 --> 36:23.694
I've heard enough.

36:25.952 --> 36:29.263
The road to hell is paved
with good intentions.

36:29.322 --> 36:33.270
The prosecution's goal to root out
corruption might be laudable,

36:33.326 --> 36:38.639
but the D.A.'s investigation violated
the integrity of the judicial process.

36:38.698 --> 36:42.544
Shame on you, Mr. McCoy,
and shame on Judge Goldman.

36:42.602 --> 36:45.947
The duty of judges is to assure
that our proceedings are conducted

36:46.005 --> 36:48.713
with total candor
and impartiality.

36:49.309 --> 36:52.950
To that end, I'm suppressing all
evidence against Charles Harmon

36:53.012 --> 36:57.290
obtained in this sham prosecution.
In my chambers.

36:58.518 --> 37:00.589
What the hell
were you thinking?

37:00.653 --> 37:01.927
I was doing my job.

37:01.988 --> 37:04.730
By making us all
look like idiots?

37:05.925 --> 37:07.700
If you try anything
like this again,

37:07.760 --> 37:09.865
I'll make Jack McCoy
my personal cause.

37:09.929 --> 37:13.138
I had binding precedent for
this type of investigation.

37:13.199 --> 37:14.439
I don't give a damn
what you do.

37:14.500 --> 37:15.706
Don't you speak
to me like that.

37:15.768 --> 37:18.078
Well, don't call me back here
and try to intimidate me.

37:18.137 --> 37:21.584
KAYLIN: Mr. McCoy, I've been
on the bench for 22 years.

37:21.641 --> 37:23.882
This institution
is more important

37:23.943 --> 37:25.752
than your ego
and your ambition.

37:25.812 --> 37:30.192
I'm sorry if I offended your sense of fair play.
This isn't a civics lesson.

37:30.249 --> 37:32.320
Someone was selling justice
in this courthouse.

37:32.385 --> 37:37.198
Those civics lessons are what
separate us from the Neanderthals,

37:37.257 --> 37:40.966
something you fail
to grasp. Now get out.

37:45.298 --> 37:48.279
RICHTER: Kaylin suppressed your
corroborating evidence, Jack.

37:48.334 --> 37:50.405
I still have an appeal.

37:50.470 --> 37:53.713
Fifty-fifty. Look, you can
cut your losses.

37:53.773 --> 37:56.117
Give us man one to
cover all charges.

37:56.175 --> 37:57.677
Minimum time.

37:57.810 --> 37:59.312
ROSS: Three to six years
for a murder?

37:59.379 --> 38:02.849
Come on, Miss Ross. They
argued, there was a struggle.

38:02.915 --> 38:04.417
This was an execution.

38:04.484 --> 38:06.157
I'm gonna make it
easy for you, Jamie.

38:06.219 --> 38:09.166
You make the deal, and we keep
the lid on the corruption.

38:09.222 --> 38:11.361
What do we keep a lid on?

38:12.592 --> 38:15.129
Hundreds of convicted
felons making motions

38:15.194 --> 38:18.141
claiming the A.D.A. who
prosecuted them is crooked.

38:18.798 --> 38:22.940
There's no evidence of that. All
we turned up were Baker's cases.

38:23.002 --> 38:25.175
How many defendants
have I put away? Huh?

38:25.805 --> 38:31.016
I can make myself available to any
one of these potential litigants.

38:31.077 --> 38:35.150
It's Adam Schiff's
worst nightmare.

38:35.782 --> 38:39.491
Harmon can gridlock this office
for the next five years.

38:39.552 --> 38:41.623
It's a bluff, Adam.

38:41.687 --> 38:43.564
If there were other fixes
besides the Baker cases,

38:43.623 --> 38:44.829
they would have
surfaced by now.

38:44.891 --> 38:48.065
It's how many cases
he says he fixed.

38:48.528 --> 38:52.999
Can we accept his ultimatum without
making it look like a cover-up?

38:53.066 --> 38:54.545
Probably not.

38:57.270 --> 38:59.841
We can't give in to blackmail.

39:00.873 --> 39:05.379
I won't go down like the Titanic.
You have one week.

39:05.745 --> 39:09.659
You come up with something to
prove murder or take their offer.

39:11.951 --> 39:14.227
Credit card receipts.

39:14.287 --> 39:16.631
Forensic accountants have been
through Harmon's records.

39:16.689 --> 39:19.431
No unusual spending
or infusions of cash.

39:19.492 --> 39:21.529
Believe me, he's got
it stashed somewhere.

39:21.594 --> 39:25.872
We did find two jars full of pennies.
Business cards.

39:28.301 --> 39:30.042
"Dodo the Clown."

39:30.103 --> 39:33.277
His son's birthday party.
Katie and I were there.

39:33.339 --> 39:35.478
I just love going through
other people's junk.

39:35.541 --> 39:40.354
"Antilles Travel Agency." Think
he was planning a little getaway?

39:40.413 --> 39:42.154
138th Street?

39:42.248 --> 39:44.751
Harlem? What was he
doing up there?

39:44.817 --> 39:48.765
Read the fine print.
"Remittances to the Caribbean."

39:49.589 --> 39:52.001
Offshore accounts.

39:52.058 --> 39:55.232
Did you ever wire money for
a man named Charlie Harmon?

39:55.294 --> 39:58.434
No. I would have remembered
a white gentleman.

39:58.498 --> 39:59.909
Arvin Baker?

39:59.966 --> 40:01.343
Sorry.

40:04.537 --> 40:06.107
Well, thank you.

40:06.239 --> 40:08.344
I always cooperate
with the D.A.

40:10.543 --> 40:12.352
You've been involved
with a case before?

40:12.412 --> 40:16.121
Last year. The district
attorney subpoenaed my records

40:16.182 --> 40:19.026
of a wire transaction
on a drug case.

40:19.519 --> 40:21.362
Do you remember the case?

40:21.420 --> 40:24.663
Geraldine... Geraldine somebody.
Geraldine Smithson?

40:24.724 --> 40:27.364
Yes, that's it, that's it.
They told me it was settled.

40:27.427 --> 40:28.462
Who told you?

40:28.528 --> 40:31.941
The same lady who came to pick up the papers.
I never get them back.

40:31.998 --> 40:34.035
She told me they
had gotten lost.

40:34.600 --> 40:37.103
This lady,
what did she look like?

40:37.603 --> 40:40.675
About your age, not as tall.

40:40.740 --> 40:44.586
She had blonde hair. And glasses.
C'est bon. Glasses.

40:47.346 --> 40:50.816
I'll never accept that
he did what you say.

40:50.883 --> 40:52.726
You know what he
was involved with.

40:52.785 --> 40:53.991
How would I?

40:54.053 --> 40:56.363
You went to a travel
agency in Harlem.

40:56.422 --> 40:59.335
You picked up documents
that Charlie needed to bury.

41:03.896 --> 41:05.398
Who told you that?

41:05.465 --> 41:07.172
It turned up during
our investigation.

41:08.634 --> 41:10.807
And we'll turn up more, now
that we know where to look.

41:17.276 --> 41:19.017
How long is he going away for?

41:19.078 --> 41:21.888
You should be thinking
about yourself.

41:21.981 --> 41:23.551
You could be charged
as an accomplice.

41:23.616 --> 41:26.927
Me? What about my kids?

41:28.087 --> 41:30.397
You cooperate with us, I'm pretty
sure I can keep you out of it.

41:30.456 --> 41:33.903
Jamie, please don't do this to us.
Charlie is not evil.

41:33.960 --> 41:38.375
Lisa! Charlie's gone! If you
could see him with the kids...

41:39.131 --> 41:43.102
Save what you have.
Save your family.

41:49.709 --> 41:51.552
I can't believe this.

41:57.850 --> 42:00.160
Charlie killed somebody.

42:02.622 --> 42:06.035
There's a 13-year-old girl
in Brooklyn without a father.

42:13.199 --> 42:16.043
I knew there was
a little extra coming in.

42:17.803 --> 42:22.274
Charlie wasn't complaining about
the mortgage like he usually does,

42:22.341 --> 42:24.878
or worrying about
the kids' college.

42:28.114 --> 42:30.958
(CRYING) I was afraid to
ask about the money.

42:33.586 --> 42:36.829
Then Charlie wanted me
to do things.

42:39.325 --> 42:42.169
He said I was the
only one he could trust.

42:46.265 --> 42:49.474
I helped him out a few
times, like he wanted.

42:52.705 --> 42:53.740
(SIGHS)

42:53.806 --> 42:55.945
What else could I do, Jamie?

42:57.943 --> 42:59.889
He's my husband.

43:01.147 --> 43:05.323
JACK: Murder two, 25-to-life
It's a final offer.

43:05.384 --> 43:08.456
(SCOFFS) You brought us back
here to sing the same old song?

43:08.521 --> 43:12.799
Tell Schiff he better get some more
bodies down at the appeals bureau.

43:12.859 --> 43:15.499
Tell your wife to
hire a good lawyer.

43:17.763 --> 43:18.969
You're charging her?
With what?

43:19.432 --> 43:22.311
She did your dirty work
at the travel agency.

43:22.368 --> 43:24.905
The indictment's
presented and voted.

43:24.971 --> 43:28.885
Bribery as an accessory.
Conspiracy to commit murder.

43:28.941 --> 43:30.284
She didn't know anything.

43:30.343 --> 43:34.485
You picked the rules.
I'm just upping the ante.

43:37.216 --> 43:38.854
It's a bluff, isn't it?

43:38.918 --> 43:41.592
You plead to murder two,
plus nine counts of bribery.

43:41.654 --> 43:43.656
If you make any
false allegations

43:43.723 --> 43:45.498
about cases you
claim you fixed,

43:45.558 --> 43:48.596
I will personally file the
indictment and have Lisa arrested.

43:48.661 --> 43:51.835
She'll have grandchildren by the
time she gets out of Bedford Hills.

43:54.934 --> 43:56.845
How could you do this?
How could you?

43:56.902 --> 43:57.937
RICHTER: Don't say
a word, Charlie.

43:58.004 --> 44:00.951
Is that what you want, Jamie?
To destroy my family?

44:01.007 --> 44:02.384
You did that on your own.

44:02.441 --> 44:04.045
HARMON: I tried to make
a decent life for them.

44:04.110 --> 44:05.282
By killing somebody?

44:05.344 --> 44:07.551
It went too far.
I am sorry about that.

44:07.613 --> 44:09.615
Try to understand, Jamie.

44:10.750 --> 44:12.957
It's not in the
job description.

44:14.286 --> 44:16.027
It's all just a hobby for you.

44:16.088 --> 44:18.830
Rich ex-husband, big bank account.
Charlie.

44:18.891 --> 44:20.427
No! You're a
dilettante, Jamie.

44:20.493 --> 44:21.995
You never had to
sweat out a paycheck.

44:22.061 --> 44:24.337
You don't give a damn
that a drug dealer's car

44:24.397 --> 44:26.468
costs more than a D.A.
could make in a year.

44:26.532 --> 44:27.840
So you became
a corrupt D.A.?

44:27.900 --> 44:30.141
I took profits
from drug dealers!

44:30.202 --> 44:32.113
You took advantage
of desperate people.

44:32.171 --> 44:34.173
What you're doing to Lisa,
that's so different?

44:35.241 --> 44:39.553
You really don't know? You could
have come to me, Charlie.

44:45.618 --> 44:46.824
(SIGHS)

44:53.059 --> 44:56.336
I'll call Judge Kaylin
and tell him we have a deal?

45:14.847 --> 45:17.088
JACK: If he hadn't cracked,

45:17.416 --> 45:19.521
were you gonna follow
through with Lisa Harmon?

45:20.653 --> 45:22.633
I have the right
to remain silent.

45:23.189 --> 45:25.191
You didn't do anything wrong.

45:25.491 --> 45:26.993
Why do I feel like I did?

45:27.059 --> 45:30.040
Charlie Harmon doesn't
deserve your sympathy.

45:32.097 --> 45:35.510
He's just another name
on another indictment.

45:36.502 --> 45:38.709
Maybe that's the problem.

45:39.772 --> 45:43.219
I'm taking the rest of the day.
I'll see you tomorrow.
