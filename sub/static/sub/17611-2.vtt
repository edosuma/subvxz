00:40.541 --> 00:42.960
Yeah, it's great to be here.

00:43.002 --> 00:45.128
Here's some tasks for you for today.

00:45.170 --> 00:47.882
Okay. There better be some

00:45.170 --> 00:47.882
fucking easy ones. I need to eat!

00:47.923 --> 00:50.801

That's not very hard.

01:01.896 --> 01:03.355
Lederhosen? Are you fucking kidding me?

01:03.397 --> 01:05.733
It's gonna be great.

What's that? Like a nude...

01:12.865 --> 01:14.825

01:14.867 --> 01:17.285
It's Berlin. It's a bit freaky.

01:17.327 --> 01:18.913
Right on, Bubs! Oh, okay.

01:18.954 --> 01:20.581
Let's see some boobs! That's not too bad.

01:20.622 --> 01:22.290
Boobs are in the mix today!

01:31.592 --> 01:34.177
somebody registered.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.525
We can't win it. Bubs, you might

01:46.523 --> 01:48.525
be able to.

01:48.567 --> 01:51.278
You're one of the best skaters

01:48.567 --> 01:51.278
I've ever met.

01:51.319 --> 01:53.488
Well, I'm pretty good, yeah, but I mean...

01:53.530 --> 01:55.074
Look, Bubs, who do they call

01:55.115 --> 01:57.534
the fucking Wayne Gretzky Jr., huh?

01:57.576 --> 01:59.327
Well, me but that's on ice, Julian.

01:57.576 --> 01:59.327
You!

01:59.369 --> 02:00.996
Come on, Bubs. You can do this, man.

02:01.038 --> 02:02.664
Think about it. Why don't you do it?

02:02.706 --> 02:05.084
I'm good at skating on ice, not on wheels.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.795
You've got bigger muscles than me.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.795
Bubs, I've got this.

02:07.836 --> 02:10.171
I'm not going to go on a fucking marathon

02:10.213 --> 02:12.132
(Muttering) Oh, 10,000 euros.

02:12.173 --> 02:13.550
That's a lot of money.

02:13.592 --> 02:16.470
Okay, I'll fucking do it, but...

02:16.511 --> 02:18.097
Only if I'm wearing hockey gear.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.766
That's the deal. All right.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.183
Easy enough.

02:22.225 --> 02:23.811
I'll get you registered up.

02:23.852 --> 02:25.604
Now, let's go do this little dance,

02:25.646 --> 02:28.065
get the little picture of the fucking

02:25.646 --> 02:28.065
naked chick,

02:28.107 --> 02:30.109

02:28.107 --> 02:30.109
you some hockey gear, okay?

02:30.150 --> 02:32.569
You can do this, buddy!

02:30.150 --> 02:32.569
You can do it, man.

02:32.611 --> 02:34.571
Ricky: 10 fucking grand!

02:32.611 --> 02:34.571
Think of the partying we can do tonight!

02:34.613 --> 02:36.448
I woke up today in a pretty good mood,

02:36.490 --> 02:37.950
thinking, "Hey, Bubbles, brand new day!

02:37.992 --> 02:39.451
Get up and get at her!"

02:39.493 --> 02:41.453
I'm not up two minutes, and I find out

02:41.495 --> 02:44.623
I'm entered in the goddamn Berlin Marathon.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.458
I couldn't go in the fucking Berlin Marathon

02:46.500 --> 02:48.002
on the best of days,

02:48.043 --> 02:50.045
let alone on a... empty stomach.

02:50.087 --> 02:52.464
So we're going to have to do some of

02:50.087 --> 02:52.464
these easier tasks,

02:52.506 --> 02:54.299
make some money and...

02:54.341 --> 02:55.801
hopefully get something to eat.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.176
Listen to my stomach, listen.

03:00.973 --> 03:02.683

03:00.973 --> 03:02.683

03:02.724 --> 03:05.060

03:02.724 --> 03:05.060

03:05.102 --> 03:07.437
We've got to get some food.

03:05.102 --> 03:07.437
I'm starving too, Ricky.

03:07.479 --> 03:09.148
I don't care about you not having

03:07.479 --> 03:09.148
a drink then.

03:09.188 --> 03:10.774
Well, do you see me whining about it?

03:10.816 --> 03:12.567
This is the place, boys.

03:12.609 --> 03:14.319
So what the fuck is this shit we've

03:12.609 --> 03:14.319
got to wear?

03:14.361 --> 03:17.572
Lederhosen. We're not wearing

03:14.361 --> 03:17.572
leather shorts, man.

03:17.614 --> 03:19.950
Leather shorts are fucking cool.

03:19.992 --> 03:21.702
Freddie Mercury wore leather shorts.

03:21.743 --> 03:23.537
Yeah, well, we're not gay, all right?

03:23.578 --> 03:25.539
Freddie Mercury was cool. Look...

03:25.580 --> 03:27.958
I'm not saying he wasn't cool.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.924

03:35.966 --> 03:38.177
No, we, uh, don't speak German,

03:38.218 --> 03:39.720
but we have, um... Give her the card.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.680

03:41.722 --> 03:43.557

03:43.598 --> 03:46.143

03:43.598 --> 03:46.143
Mm-hmm.

03:46.185 --> 03:48.062

03:48.103 --> 03:50.147
OK, boys, I can't come to a fucking country

03:50.189 --> 03:51.982

03:52.024 --> 03:53.984

04:10.959 --> 04:12.669

04:10.959 --> 04:12.669

None of the fucking words make sense.

04:19.176 --> 04:21.678

04:23.304 --> 04:25.182
which we are... and looking awesome,

04:25.224 --> 04:27.059
I might add. Bubs.

04:25.224 --> 04:27.059
We look fucked!

04:27.101 --> 04:28.476

04:28.518 --> 04:31.105
I disagree. I think we look cool.

04:31.146 --> 04:32.522
Where do we go?

04:32.564 --> 04:34.191
We have to into biergarten

04:34.233 --> 04:35.901
and learn a traditional

04:34.233 --> 04:35.901
German dance

04:35.943 --> 04:37.569
and we get 25 euros.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.696
We've got to dance?

04:39.738 --> 04:41.281
We've got to learn a German dance, yeah.

04:41.322 --> 04:42.950
I don't know how to fucking dance.

04:42.991 --> 04:44.826
Well, that's why it's fucking

04:42.991 --> 04:44.826
called learning.

04:44.868 --> 04:46.578
Let's just get it over with. I need

04:44.868 --> 04:46.578
to fucking eat

04:46.620 --> 04:48.329
and hopefully find some German

04:46.620 --> 04:48.329
weed or hash.

04:48.371 --> 04:51.416
This is the worst fucking time of my entire life.

Well, I disagree.

04:58.632 --> 04:59.925
This is cool, Ricky.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.301
This is a real...

How are we going to do this?

05:12.562 --> 05:14.106
Well, we've got to get somebody to teach us,

05:14.148 --> 05:15.774
so I don't know. Fuck's sakes...

05:15.816 --> 05:17.067
Maybe if we go up to the dance floor,

05:17.109 --> 05:18.902
somebody will... All right.

Whatever!

06:07.159 --> 06:09.328
One of the top ten dancers in Canada!

06:09.368 --> 06:11.330
People always call him Patrick Swayze.

06:11.370 --> 06:14.082

Julian used to do the front splits,

06:29.472 --> 06:31.266
but for some reason, when he dances,

06:31.308 --> 06:33.060
he gets a fucking erection, so he doesn't like to do it.

06:33.101 --> 06:34.936
I don't if it's the way the fabric, you know, rubs up

06:34.978 --> 06:36.521
against his shaft or his balls or

06:34.978 --> 06:36.521
what the fuck it is,

06:36.563 --> 06:38.523
but it's weird. Ricky said what?

06:38.565 --> 06:40.525
I get an erection when I'm dancing?

Let's get you some fuel

07:26.654 --> 07:28.531
for this fucking marathon, buddy.

07:28.573 --> 07:29.783
(Sigh)

07:29.824 --> 07:30.992
(Imitating honking horn)

07:33.494 --> 07:34.871
Ricky: How are you feeling?

07:34.913 --> 07:36.331
Bubbles: Well, I'm fucking

07:34.913 --> 07:36.331
nervous.

07:36.373 --> 07:37.582
What do you think, Ricky?

07:37.624 --> 07:39.042
I've never been in a marathon before.

07:39.084 --> 07:40.794
How fucking hard is it going to be, Bubs?

07:40.835 --> 07:42.296
"How hard is it going to be"?

07:42.337 --> 07:44.089
Julian, it's professional athletes

07:44.131 --> 07:46.674
that train all year to come in this thing,

07:46.716 --> 07:48.760
and now all of a sudden I just come in, eh?

07:48.802 --> 07:50.637
You're a good skater. Roller blades.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.637
Come on.

07:50.678 --> 07:52.013
You just have to finish.

07:52.055 --> 07:53.598
You don't got to fucking win, man.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.768
Oh yeah, just finish a 42 km fucking

07:53.640 --> 07:56.768
marathon,

07:56.810 --> 07:58.603
no big deal!

07:58.645 --> 08:00.272
Boys, I'm so fucking hungry

08:00.314 --> 08:02.107
I could eat the arse out of a dead skunk.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.858
What's up, boys? We're here

08:02.149 --> 08:03.858
to get paid,

08:03.900 --> 08:05.568
that's what's up. Paid?

08:05.610 --> 08:07.404
Yeah. Let's go with some money.

08:07.446 --> 08:09.739
Yeah, Gertrude sent me the

08:07.446 --> 08:09.739
fucking video.

08:09.781 --> 08:11.950
The worst display of dancing ever,

08:11.992 --> 08:13.618
If it were up to me,

08:13.660 --> 08:15.329
I wouldn't pay them one euro.

08:15.370 --> 08:17.414
Horrible fucking execution.

08:17.456 --> 08:19.166
Tsk!

08:19.207 --> 08:21.376
Ten for you. Right on.

08:21.418 --> 08:23.378
Ten for you.

08:23.420 --> 08:24.629
Five for you.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.214
Nice job, Swayze.

08:26.256 --> 08:27.966
Are you fucking kidding me? Five?

08:28.008 --> 08:29.843
Five. Shit effort. I think that makes

08:28.008 --> 08:29.843
perfect sense.

08:29.884 --> 08:31.719
Ricky: Me too.

08:29.884 --> 08:31.719
I put a lot more effort

08:31.761 --> 08:33.347
into my dancing than you did.

08:33.388 --> 08:35.349
You didn't even try. I was fucking trying.

08:35.390 --> 08:37.725
You were not. You didn't

08:35.390 --> 08:37.725
even get your...

08:37.767 --> 08:39.811
I don't know how to fucking dance, I keep

08:37.767 --> 08:39.811
telling you that!

08:39.853 --> 08:41.229
Oh, it was two moves!

08:41.271 --> 08:43.023
See you boys back at the bus.

08:43.064 --> 08:44.483
Julian: Go fuck yourself.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.443
Let's order some fucking food

08:44.524 --> 08:46.443
right now.

08:47.735 --> 08:49.529
I've got 10 to spend.

08:49.570 --> 08:52.032
How are you?

08:52.073 --> 08:54.159
(Speaking in German)

08:54.201 --> 08:56.536
Ummm... we don't talk...

08:56.577 --> 08:58.163
Oh... um...

08:58.205 --> 09:00.540
wir haben octopus burger da heute...

09:00.581 --> 09:01.916
Burger? Did you say burger?

09:01.958 --> 09:03.418
Ja, genau...  Burger? Burger?

09:03.460 --> 09:04.669
Yes, burger!

09:04.711 --> 09:06.796
(Speaking in German)

09:06.838 --> 09:08.048
Uh, yes, yeah.

09:08.089 --> 09:09.632
Waitress: (Continuing in German)

09:09.674 --> 09:11.385
Do you have, uh, like, chicken...

09:11.426 --> 09:13.678
chicken fingers? Chicken?

09:11.426 --> 09:13.678
Bwok, bwok, bwok?

09:13.720 --> 09:17.057
(Speaking in German)

09:19.767 --> 09:21.436
She's probably saying,

09:21.478 --> 09:22.937
"Do you want a sauce with that?"

09:22.979 --> 09:24.189
I would assume. Yes.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.982
Ja? Genau. Okay.

09:26.024 --> 09:28.360
Rum and Coke? That's all I got.

09:28.402 --> 09:30.611
(Speaking in German) What? No?

09:30.653 --> 09:32.822
(In German) What? Yeah, just

09:30.653 --> 09:32.822
rum and Coke.

09:32.864 --> 09:34.574
You can put it in that.

09:34.615 --> 09:36.451
I don't suppose... don't suppose you

09:34.615 --> 09:36.451
have, like, hash

09:36.493 --> 09:37.952
or weed? Uh...

09:37.994 --> 09:40.414
(Speaking in German)

09:42.332 --> 09:44.167
Sounds like there's some over there.

09:44.209 --> 09:45.710
Ja?  Thank you.

09:45.752 --> 09:46.920
Dankeshön.  Thank you.

09:48.463 --> 09:49.964
Boys, I can't fucking deal with the language.

09:50.006 --> 09:51.674
I can't understand anything they're saying.

09:51.716 --> 09:53.385
Well, you can assume that when she come up,

09:53.427 --> 09:55.303
she said, "Can I take your order?"

09:55.345 --> 09:56.971
And then I heard "burger" in there, so...

09:57.013 --> 09:58.348
it's not that difficult.

09:58.390 --> 09:59.849
Well, how does she understand us?

09:59.891 --> 10:01.893
It doesn't even make sense.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.270
That's right, it doesn't make sense.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.397
She doesn't understand us.

10:05.439 --> 10:06.814
I said "chicken fingers". She's like, "Yup!"

10:06.856 --> 10:08.233
No, but Ricky, I went

10:08.275 --> 10:10.193
"chicken"... "fingers".

10:10.235 --> 10:11.528
I said "hash or weed"

10:11.570 --> 10:12.862
and she was, like, "Yeah."

10:12.904 --> 10:15.574
You went like that. She knows.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.617
Symbols. They talk in symbols.

10:17.658 --> 10:19.744
People that talk in symbols are fucked in the head.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.162
Asking to get high should be understood

10:21.204 --> 10:22.581
by every fucking person

10:22.622 --> 10:24.916
on every fucking planet in every fucking spaces!

10:24.958 --> 10:27.127
Holy fuck, boys, I wonder if it's

10:24.958 --> 10:27.127
going to be, like,

10:27.168 --> 10:29.796
a, you know, like a hand-pressed patty.

10:29.837 --> 10:31.798
Or if it's going to be... you know,

10:29.837 --> 10:31.798
I don't even care

10:31.839 --> 10:33.841
if it's a frozen... (Imitating explosion)

10:33.883 --> 10:35.469
as long as it's a big dirty...

10:35.510 --> 10:37.471
You're giving me a few bites.

10:37.512 --> 10:38.721
Like fuck I am!

10:38.763 --> 10:40.390
Bubs, I only had enough for a drink, man.

10:40.432 --> 10:41.975
Are you going to let me starve?

10:40.432 --> 10:41.975
Well, you get a drink.

10:42.016 --> 10:43.435
So that's what you spent your money on.

10:42.016 --> 10:43.435
Thank you.

10:43.477 --> 10:45.645
You could have got some French fries.

10:45.686 --> 10:47.439
Those look pretty good.

10:47.481 --> 10:49.149
Und ein octopus burger.

10:49.190 --> 10:51.109
Wah-h-h! Guten appetit.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.819
What? What the fuck is that?

10:52.860 --> 10:54.362
Nice burger there, Bubs.

10:54.404 --> 10:56.739
Octopus burger?

10:56.781 --> 10:58.699
That's a fucking real octopus!

10:58.741 --> 11:00.743
It's so easy to understand what the

10:58.741 --> 11:00.743
fuck they're saying, huh?

11:00.785 --> 11:02.454
Well, I heard her say "burger".

11:02.496 --> 11:04.080
You fucked up, didn't you?

11:04.122 --> 11:08.376
That's a whole octopus on there!

11:08.418 --> 11:11.296
Oh, it is, too. Ricky, just...

11:11.338 --> 11:13.465
Does it have a head? I'm too fucking hungry

11:11.338 --> 11:13.465
to order something else.

11:13.507 --> 11:15.509
You're not going to eat that, are you?

11:15.550 --> 11:17.636
I'm going to have to. Bubs, don't

11:15.550 --> 11:17.636
do it, man.

11:17.676 --> 11:18.886
That's gross.

11:18.928 --> 11:20.180
Come here, little buddy.

11:20.221 --> 11:21.389
Fuck!

11:22.474 --> 11:24.017
Jesus Christ!

11:25.393 --> 11:27.228
Bubs, that's fucking disgusting, man!

11:27.270 --> 11:28.980
How is it?

11:29.022 --> 11:30.190
It's octopus-y.

11:31.650 --> 11:33.151
God...

11:33.193 --> 11:35.195
Pretty good, actually. Here, Julian.

11:35.236 --> 11:36.946
Get that fucking thing away... You know what? I think,

11:35.236 --> 11:36.946
as my friend,

11:36.988 --> 11:38.365
I should offer you half my food.

11:38.406 --> 11:39.866
Get that fucking thing away from me.

11:38.406 --> 11:39.866
Come on.

11:39.907 --> 11:41.535
Bubs, I swear to fuck.

11:41.576 --> 11:42.827
Get it away from me.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.287
Bubs!

11:44.329 --> 11:45.872
I'm gonna take a couple of your fries, though.

11:45.913 --> 11:47.957
No, you're not. Whoa-whoa-whoa-

11:45.913 --> 11:47.957
whoa-whoa-whoa.

11:47.999 --> 11:50.001
You're not going to give me a chicken nugget?

11:50.043 --> 11:51.294
I only have enough for me.

11:51.336 --> 11:53.171
Just have a drink.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.797
One drink, one nugget.

11:54.839 --> 11:56.383
I'll have a drink.

11:56.424 --> 11:57.676
No, no, no, no, no, no...

11:57.716 --> 11:59.718
Well, I'm having a few more fries then.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.513
Oh, my God, it feels good to eat, boys.

12:01.555 --> 12:03.014
I thought I was going to fucking die!

12:03.056 --> 12:04.558
...a little octopus in your drink there.

12:04.599 --> 12:06.934
(Chuckling) Fuck off. Did you?

12:06.976 --> 12:08.269
Ughh!

12:08.311 --> 12:10.104
I never had a octopus burger before,

12:10.146 --> 12:12.524
but they're actually pretty fucking delicious.

12:12.566 --> 12:14.025
Other than them, you know,

12:14.067 --> 12:16.110
getting suctioned to your mouth every now and then.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.279
But it filled me right up and...

12:18.321 --> 12:21.074
I'm just going to let that digest before

12:18.321 --> 12:21.074
we go to the marathon.

12:21.115 --> 12:23.117
In the meantime, I figure, you know,

12:23.159 --> 12:25.036
make few bucks getting some pictures taken

12:25.078 --> 12:26.829
with some naked ladies!

12:26.871 --> 12:28.831
(Grunting)

12:32.001 --> 12:33.503
Is this the right place?

12:33.545 --> 12:35.422
Well, it said go past the Bismarck statue,

12:35.463 --> 12:36.881
and this is it. Okay.

12:36.923 --> 12:38.717
There's some nude people right there.

12:38.757 --> 12:40.301
Ricky: Right on. Some boobs.

12:40.343 --> 12:42.136
Bubbles: Ladies...

12:40.343 --> 12:42.136
Julian: No, no, no, no...

12:42.178 --> 12:44.138
boys, those are all dudes.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.515
Are you fucking kidding me?

12:45.557 --> 12:47.016
This can't be the right place.

12:47.058 --> 12:49.519
Oh, my fuck, it's a setup, boys.

12:49.561 --> 12:50.769
It's a setup.

12:50.811 --> 12:52.188
Oh, those motherfuckers!

12:52.230 --> 12:53.648
I knew this was too good to be true.

12:53.690 --> 12:55.525
Fuck this! I don't need to get high that bad.

12:55.567 --> 12:57.360
Let's go. Just go over and

12:55.567 --> 12:57.360
take a picture.

12:57.402 --> 13:00.530
Let's just go. It's 25 fucking bucks!

13:00.572 --> 13:01.906
You don't have to even talk to them.

13:00.572 --> 13:01.906
We'll just...

13:01.948 --> 13:03.617
Why do I got to take the picture?

13:03.658 --> 13:05.910
I'm not taking a picture.

13:03.658 --> 13:05.910
Well, you do the talking.

13:05.952 --> 13:07.370
You're good at talking to strippers.

13:07.412 --> 13:09.289
Female strippers!

13:09.330 --> 13:11.165
Well, it's no different. Just don't look

13:09.330 --> 13:11.165
at their wieners.

13:11.207 --> 13:12.875
What do you mean, it's no fucking

13:11.207 --> 13:12.875
different?

13:12.917 --> 13:14.461
They're dudes! Just try not to look

13:12.917 --> 13:14.461
at their wieners!

13:14.502 --> 13:17.004
Just pretend we're in the fucking

13:14.502 --> 13:17.004
showers at jail.

13:17.046 --> 13:18.298
For fuck's sakes...

13:18.339 --> 13:20.592
This is fucking ridiculous.

13:18.339 --> 13:20.592
I know.

13:20.634 --> 13:21.842
Julian: I just want to go home.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.094
Bubbles: (Whispering) My God!

13:23.136 --> 13:24.887
Ricky: Ho-ly fuck, okay.

13:24.929 --> 13:27.181
Say hi, Ricky.

13:27.223 --> 13:30.560
Hey, guys. Nice day. (Mixed greetings)

13:30.602 --> 13:33.271
Just... is there any way we could

13:30.602 --> 13:33.271
get a picture?

13:33.313 --> 13:35.482
Picture? Sure, yeah.

13:35.523 --> 13:36.899
Snap it quickly here.

13:36.941 --> 13:38.443
Okay... Oh, no need

13:36.941 --> 13:38.443
to get up.

13:38.485 --> 13:39.860
Oh, my Jesus!

13:39.902 --> 13:41.237
Uh-oh.

13:41.279 --> 13:43.072
(Anxious laugh) There you go.

13:43.114 --> 13:45.074
Man: Okay, guys...

13:43.114 --> 13:45.074
a little...

13:45.116 --> 13:46.660
Yeah, no, we're in, we're in.

13:46.701 --> 13:48.077
We're all in. This is good.

13:48.119 --> 13:50.789
Over here. Ein, zwei, drei.

13:50.829 --> 13:52.666
Schön...

13:52.707 --> 13:54.292
Yes, thank you. Enjoy the day.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.502
Thank you.

13:58.379 --> 13:59.631
Did you get it?

14:02.049 --> 14:04.594
Yeah. It's on there. It's on there.

14:04.636 --> 14:06.513
Julian: Let's get the

14:04.636 --> 14:06.513
fuck out of here.

14:06.554 --> 14:08.306
All right, Bubs, let's get you in

14:06.554 --> 14:08.306
this fucking race

14:08.348 --> 14:10.016
so we can make some real money.

14:10.057 --> 14:12.435
I'm not going in that fucking race

14:10.057 --> 14:12.435
without hockey gear.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.621

21:57.984 --> 22:00.694
Julian: Yeahhh!

21:57.984 --> 22:00.694
(Clapping)

22:00.736 --> 22:02.029
Julian: Yeah, Bubs!

22:02.071 --> 22:05.283
Bubbles! Whoo!

22:05.324 --> 22:07.034
Boys! You did it, man!

22:07.076 --> 22:08.494
I did it! Skated the whole race,

22:08.535 --> 22:10.288
didn't cheat once! Right on, buddy!

22:10.329 --> 22:12.915
Right on, man! (Laughing)

22:12.957 --> 22:15.001
Oh, buddy. Awesome! We're getting drunk

22:12.957 --> 22:15.001
tonight, Bubs!

22:15.042 --> 22:16.877
$1000! Whoo!

22:16.919 --> 22:19.255
Let's go get fucked up! I did it! I did it.

22:19.297 --> 22:21.966
Boys, I think I just made us

22:19.297 --> 22:21.966
a thousand bucks.

22:22.008 --> 22:23.968
Fucking right, you did, man.

22:22.008 --> 22:23.968
A thousand!

22:24.010 --> 22:25.803
That's going to change the trip a little bit.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.763
Ten thousand would have been awesome,

22:25.845 --> 22:27.763
but you know...

22:27.805 --> 22:29.849
Fuck... a thousand bucks

22:27.805 --> 22:29.849
is fucking good, man.

22:29.890 --> 22:32.059
Are you seriously...? Well, I'm just

22:29.890 --> 22:32.059
saying, you know...

22:32.101 --> 22:34.020
You're disappointed in me.

22:32.101 --> 22:34.020
Oh, no.

22:34.061 --> 22:36.147
A thousand bucks is going to get us

22:34.061 --> 22:36.147
drunk tonight, man.

22:36.189 --> 22:37.898
There we go. That's for you.

22:37.940 --> 22:39.525
Ricky: All right, Bubbles!

22:37.940 --> 22:39.525
Thank you!

22:39.566 --> 22:41.068
Thank you. (Chuckling)

22:41.110 --> 22:43.988
Boys, look at that. Good job.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.363
Congratulations, man. All right.

22:45.405 --> 22:46.866
Berlin Marathon. Medallist.

22:46.907 --> 22:48.492
Let's go get drunk now.

22:48.534 --> 22:51.329
Even though I... only did about...

22:51.369 --> 22:52.955
you know, maybe a kilometre of it,

22:52.997 --> 22:55.582
I still feel like a winner, you know?

22:55.624 --> 22:57.375
If you just keep at it, persevere,

22:57.417 --> 22:59.670
it pays off, and you... you win things like that.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.922
You know, nobody has to know

23:01.964 --> 23:04.633
that Ricky and Julian drove me 40 kilometres.

23:07.094 --> 23:09.096
Ricky: I'm going to get so

23:07.094 --> 23:09.096
fucked up tonight in Berlin, boys!

23:09.138 --> 23:11.057
Julian: I'm eating a big

23:09.138 --> 23:11.057
fucking steak, boys!

23:11.098 --> 23:13.267
Bubbles: Yes...

23:11.098 --> 23:13.267
We're leaving here in two minutes.

23:13.309 --> 23:15.269
What the fuck are you talking about?

23:13.309 --> 23:15.269
We've got a border crossing

23:15.311 --> 23:17.479
and a ferry to catch. I don't fucking think so.

23:17.521 --> 23:19.648
We're partying our fucking asses off in

23:17.521 --> 23:19.648
Berlin tonight. Oh, really?

23:19.690 --> 23:21.775
We're getting fucking high and drunk and we're

23:19.690 --> 23:21.775
going to eat like kings!

23:21.817 --> 23:24.070
And how are you going to do that?

23:24.111 --> 23:26.113
1,025 fucking euros you owe us.

23:24.111 --> 23:26.113
Let's go! Yeah. Oh, really?

23:26.155 --> 23:28.908
Here's 25 of it. That was real

23:26.155 --> 23:28.908
funny, eh?

23:28.949 --> 23:31.369
Naked dudes! Who's got the

23:28.949 --> 23:31.369
invisible arms?

23:31.409 --> 23:33.453
That's not a fucking selfie.

23:33.495 --> 23:36.540
Well, one of the naked guys jumped up

23:33.495 --> 23:36.540
and he took the picture.

23:36.582 --> 23:38.584
I wasn't about to fucking challenge him.

23:36.582 --> 23:38.584
It's not a selfie!

23:38.625 --> 23:40.544
His wiener was flapping at me.

23:40.586 --> 23:42.380
You're fucking paying...

23:40.586 --> 23:42.380
That's gone.

23:42.420 --> 23:44.506
Oh, my fuck! Okay, then you owe us

23:42.420 --> 23:44.506
a thousand euro!

23:44.548 --> 23:46.384
Or whatever the fuck they're called.

23:44.548 --> 23:46.384
Oh, really?

23:46.424 --> 23:48.302
Yeah. A thousand euros?

23:46.424 --> 23:48.302
Yes. See this?

23:48.344 --> 23:49.887
Look at that. Where did you

23:48.344 --> 23:49.887
buy that at?

23:49.929 --> 23:51.805
I didn't buy that. I got that

23:51.847 --> 23:54.600
when I crossed the finish line at the

23:51.847 --> 23:54.600
Berlin Marathon. Yeah.

23:54.641 --> 23:57.770
Do you guys think I'm fucking stupid?

23:57.811 --> 24:00.606
I saw you steal the fucking car.

24:00.647 --> 24:02.566
Give me the dope. What dope?

24:02.608 --> 24:05.819
You saw the fucking drug dealer.

24:02.608 --> 24:05.819
Give me the dope.

24:05.861 --> 24:08.072
I'm getting fucking high. I haven't been high

24:05.861 --> 24:08.072
since I left Canada.

24:08.114 --> 24:09.740
Fair's fair here. Come on.

24:09.782 --> 24:11.617
We're leaving in 60 seconds.

24:11.658 --> 24:13.160
What the fuck are you talking about?

24:13.202 --> 24:14.954
60 seconds we're rolling.

24:13.202 --> 24:14.954
Okay...

24:14.995 --> 24:16.496
That ain't gonna be on the bus.

24:16.538 --> 24:18.082
He can roll a joint in 60 seconds.

24:18.124 --> 24:19.583
He can roll it quicker than that.

24:19.625 --> 24:21.543
Julian: Are you fucking

24:19.625 --> 24:21.543
everywhere, man?

24:21.585 --> 24:23.629
Yeah. I'm up your ass all night and day.

24:23.670 --> 24:25.672
This is fucking ridiculous!

24:23.670 --> 24:25.672
Come on, Ricky.

24:25.714 --> 24:27.341
Do you need a hand table?

24:27.383 --> 24:30.344
Hand table, Ricky. Okay, Bubs.

24:30.386 --> 24:32.012
Julian: You can do it, Rick,

24:30.386 --> 24:32.012
you can do it, man.

24:32.054 --> 24:33.680
Bubbles: You've done this

24:32.054 --> 24:33.680
many times, Ricky.

24:33.722 --> 24:35.473
Julian: This is fucking

24:33.722 --> 24:35.473
bullshit! 40 seconds.

24:35.515 --> 24:37.393
Just let him smoke his goddamn joint.

24:37.435 --> 24:39.061
No problem. You've got it, Ricky.

24:39.103 --> 24:41.479
Look at that. He's got it.

24:39.103 --> 24:41.479
Ohhhh.

24:41.521 --> 24:43.774
look at you, you beautiful little lady.

24:43.816 --> 24:45.859
15 seconds. Bubbles:

24:43.816 --> 24:45.859
Oh, my God,

24:45.901 --> 24:47.361
that's not going to be enough time.

24:47.403 --> 24:49.196
If we get it lit before the time's up,

24:49.238 --> 24:51.240
we get to smoke it. That's the deal.

24:51.282 --> 24:54.910
(Whispering) Come on, Ricky.

24:51.282 --> 24:54.910
15 seconds.

24:54.952 --> 24:57.079
Get out the lighter, get out the lighter, man!

24:54.952 --> 24:57.079
You got it!

24:57.121 --> 24:58.789
You got it! See that?

24:58.831 --> 25:02.001
(Lighter clicking) That's how that goes.

25:02.042 --> 25:04.211
Ricky, shake the lighter. No, you didn't make it.

25:04.253 --> 25:06.130
(Sputtering) That's it.

25:06.172 --> 25:08.382
Let's go.

25:08.424 --> 25:10.426
You've got to be fucking kidding me, boys.

25:10.468 --> 25:12.136
My lungs, they're not going to keep working

25:12.178 --> 25:13.595
unless I get smoke in them.

25:13.637 --> 25:17.057
Well, I've got to fucking eat!

25:17.099 --> 25:18.767
This is worst fucking trip ever.

25:18.809 --> 25:20.644
No shit! We're in hell, boys.

25:20.686 --> 25:22.271
Yeah, and you brought us here.

25:22.313 --> 25:24.648
Are you going to keep blaming

25:22.313 --> 25:24.648
this shit on me?

25:24.690 --> 25:27.026
Huh?

25:27.067 --> 25:28.902
You had to fucking cheat, didn't you?

25:27.067 --> 25:28.902
Yeah.

25:28.944 --> 25:30.654
A thousand fucking euros!

25:30.696 --> 25:32.198
Oh, my fuck!

25:32.239 --> 25:34.450
You're blaming this on me, for cheating!

25:34.492 --> 25:49.423
( ♪♪ )

27:04.248 --> 27:08.043
(Seabirds squawking)

27:19.305 --> 27:23.434
Fish: Fuck! Fuck! Fuck off! Fuck!...

27:23.476 --> 27:25.978
Fuck off! Jesus Christ!

27:29.982 --> 27:31.358
(Whisper) Fuck.

27:31.400 --> 27:33.360
(Light clicks off) Fuck off.
