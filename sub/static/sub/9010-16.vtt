00:08.417 --> 00:09.500

00:09.542 --> 00:12.542
OH, YOU GOT

00:09.542 --> 00:12.542
A VIDEO CHAT REQUEST

00:09.542 --> 00:12.542
FROM JORDAN.

00:12.584 --> 00:15.542
KAZ, DON'T ANSWER IT! JORDAN

00:12.584 --> 00:15.542
CAN'T KNOW WE'RE IN MIGHTY M--

00:15.584 --> 00:20.042
MY MY MY!

00:15.584 --> 00:20.042

00:15.584 --> 00:20.042
WHY HELLO!

00:21.125 --> 00:22.876
HEY.

00:22.918 --> 00:24.042
WHERE ARE YOU GUYS?

00:24.083 --> 00:26.042
UM, IN MY ROOM.

00:24.083 --> 00:26.042
I REDECORATED.

00:26.083 --> 00:30.500
I WENT FOR

00:26.083 --> 00:30.500
A POST-MODERN HOSPITAL MOTIF.

00:30.542 --> 00:32.876
VERY UGLY.

00:32.918 --> 00:34.042
I LIKE IT.

00:34.083 --> 00:36.042
SO ARE YOU GUYS COMING TO

00:36.083 --> 00:38.042
THE "GARGOYLES AND GOBLETS"

00:36.083 --> 00:38.042
TOURNAMENT AT THE DOMAIN

00:36.083 --> 00:38.042
TONIGHT?

00:38.083 --> 00:41.459
EVERYONE WHO'S NO ONE

00:38.083 --> 00:41.459
IS GONNA BE THERE.

00:41.500 --> 00:44.042
OOH, IS THAT JORDAN?

00:41.500 --> 00:44.042
HI, JORDAN!

00:44.083 --> 00:45.876
OOH, IS THAT CONNIE?

00:45.918 --> 00:46.918
( beeps )

00:50.626 --> 00:53.125
I'M SURE I'M PROBABLY

00:50.626 --> 00:53.125
JUST IMAGINING IT,

00:53.167 --> 00:55.500
BUT SOMETIMES I GET THE FEELING

00:53.167 --> 00:55.500
THAT JORDAN DOESN'T LIKE ME.

00:55.542 --> 00:58.042
OH, DON'T BE SILLY.

00:58.083 --> 01:01.292
YOU'RE NOT IMAGINING IT.

00:58.083 --> 01:01.292
SHE CAN'T STAND YOU.

01:01.334 --> 01:04.042
WHAT? HOW CAN SHE NOT LIKE ME?

01:04.083 --> 01:06.584
SKYLAR, DON'T TAKE IT

01:04.083 --> 01:06.584
PERSONALLY. JORDAN

01:04.083 --> 01:06.584
DOESN'T LIKE ANYONE.

01:06.626 --> 01:11.542
SHE'S PLANNING

01:06.626 --> 01:11.542
A "SOUR SIXTEEN" PARTY.

01:06.626 --> 01:11.542
NOBODY'S INVITED.

01:11.584 --> 01:13.584
BUT EVERYONE HAS TO LIKE ME!

01:13.626 --> 01:16.500
I'M SKYLAR STORM.

01:13.626 --> 01:16.500
I WAS ADORED BY MILLIONS!

01:16.542 --> 01:18.042
I MISS THAT.

01:18.083 --> 01:21.959
SO I SWEAR,

01:18.083 --> 01:21.959
BY THE SACRED RINGS OF CALDERA,

01:22.000 --> 01:25.042
I SHALL NOT REST

01:22.000 --> 01:25.042
UNTIL JORDAN IS, LIKE,

01:22.000 --> 01:25.042
TOTALLY MY BFF!

01:27.959 --> 01:30.042
OH, GOOD, OUR SHIFT IS OVER.

01:30.083 --> 01:33.000
CAN'T WANT TO GO HOME,

01:30.083 --> 01:33.000
GET IN BED, AND SLEEP

01:30.083 --> 01:33.000
UNTIL MONDAY.

01:33.042 --> 01:34.375
BOYS, I NEED YOU

01:33.042 --> 01:34.375
TO WORK THE NIGHT SHIFT,

01:34.417 --> 01:37.042
WHICH MEANS

01:34.417 --> 01:37.042
YOU WON'T SLEEP TILL MONDAY.

01:37.083 --> 01:39.042
BUT I'M EXHAUSTED.

01:39.083 --> 01:41.292
AND WHAT WILL I TELL MY PARENTS

01:39.083 --> 01:41.292
ABOUT WHERE I AM?

01:41.334 --> 01:43.042
I CAN'T TELL THEM

01:41.334 --> 01:43.042
THAT I WORK HERE.

01:43.083 --> 01:44.667
JUST TELL YOUR PARENTS

01:43.083 --> 01:44.667
YOU'RE SLEEPING AT MY HOUSE.

01:44.709 --> 01:47.042
OH, I GET IT--

01:44.709 --> 01:47.042
THEN YOU TELL YOUR PARENTS

01:47.083 --> 01:48.959
YOU'RE SLEEPING AT

01:47.083 --> 01:48.959
OLIVER'S HOUSE.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.250
OH, NO, I DON'T NEED TO.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.250
MY PARENTS HAVE 11 KIDS.

01:51.292 --> 01:53.667
THEY WON'T EVEN KNOW

01:51.292 --> 01:53.667
I'M MISSING.

01:53.709 --> 01:55.626
OH, AND ONE MORE THING:

01:53.709 --> 01:55.626
YOU MAY HAVE HEARD

01:55.667 --> 01:57.667
THAT THE NIGHT SHIFT

01:55.667 --> 01:57.667
CAN BE A LITTLE SCARY.

01:57.709 --> 01:59.667
BUT YOU'LL BE FINE...

01:59.709 --> 02:01.542
UNLESS A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME

01:59.709 --> 02:01.542
LUNAR ECLIPSE

02:01.584 --> 02:05.042

HOW LONG HAVE WE BEEN HERE?

03:10.584 --> 03:12.584
SIX MINUTES.

03:14.417 --> 03:16.709
HEY, NEOCORTEX,

03:14.417 --> 03:16.709
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU SINCE

03:16.751 --> 03:20.083
I ALMOST TURNED YOUR BRAIN

03:16.751 --> 03:20.083
INTO A NUCLEAR BOMB.

03:20.125 --> 03:22.042
( clears throat )

03:20.125 --> 03:22.042
WHAT'S WRONG?

03:22.083 --> 03:23.709
WHENEVER I TRY

03:22.083 --> 03:23.709
TO READ SOMEONE'S MIND,

03:23.751 --> 03:26.042
THEY JUST FALL INTO

03:23.751 --> 03:26.042
A DAYDREAM-LIKE TRANCE.

03:26.083 --> 03:30.626
AND I WAS KIND OF

03:26.083 --> 03:30.626
HOPING TO TALK TO

03:26.083 --> 03:30.626
DOCTOR ANYONE-BUT-YOU.

03:30.667 --> 03:33.125
OH, YEAH,

03:30.667 --> 03:33.125
IT'S HIS NIGHT OFF.

03:33.167 --> 03:37.042
AND IT'S PRONOUNCED

03:33.167 --> 03:37.042
DOCTOR "ANYWANBUCHOO."

03:37.083 --> 03:38.500
BUT YOU'RE IN LUCK.

03:38.542 --> 03:40.500
WE JUST GOT A NEW DEVICE

03:38.542 --> 03:40.500
THAT CREATES A MIND-LINK,

03:40.542 --> 03:42.500
SO WE CAN SEE

03:40.542 --> 03:42.500
INTO A PATIENT'S MIND

03:42.542 --> 03:44.292
TO HELP DIAGNOSE

03:42.542 --> 03:44.292
THEIR MEDICAL MYSTERIES.

03:44.334 --> 03:46.542
LET ME JUST SHOW YOU

03:44.334 --> 03:46.542
WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING.

03:46.584 --> 03:48.542
DON'T TRY IT ON ME!

03:46.584 --> 03:48.542
WHAT IF YOU FRY MY BRAIN?

03:48.584 --> 03:50.626
TRY IT ON SOMEONE

03:48.584 --> 03:50.626
WHO SERVES NO FUNCTION.

03:50.667 --> 03:55.083
I SERVE NO FUNCTION.

03:50.667 --> 03:55.083
WHAT DO YOU NEED?

03:55.125 --> 03:57.042
I JUST WANTED TO USE THIS

03:55.125 --> 03:57.042
TO LOOK INTO YOUR THOUGHTS

03:57.083 --> 04:00.042
AND KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON

03:57.083 --> 04:00.042
INSIDE THAT HEAD OF YOURS.

04:00.083 --> 04:03.042
OKAY, BUT DON'T

04:00.083 --> 04:03.042
MAKE FUN OF MY HEAD.

04:03.083 --> 04:06.042
WE ALL KNOW

04:03.083 --> 04:06.042
IT'S EMBARRASSINGLY TINY.

04:14.667 --> 04:20.459
( cheering and applause )

04:20.500 --> 04:22.041
YOU LIKE MY HEAD.

04:22.083 --> 04:25.042
YOU REALLY, REALLY LIKE MY HEAD.

04:25.083 --> 04:29.667
( cheering and applause )

04:35.459 --> 04:39.417
OH, IT WAS ONLY A DAYDREAM.

04:39.459 --> 04:44.834
HOW COULD A HEAD SO SMALL

04:39.459 --> 04:44.834
BE FILLED WITH DREAMS

04:39.459 --> 04:44.834
SO BIG?

04:46.709 --> 04:50.042
YOU'RE CAUSING PEOPLE

04:46.709 --> 04:50.042
TO GET LOST IN THEIR

04:46.709 --> 04:50.042
GREATEST FANTASIES.

04:50.083 --> 04:55.792
USING THIS THING IS LIKE

04:50.083 --> 04:55.792
READING OLIVER'S DIARY,

04:50.083 --> 04:55.792
ONLY INTERESTING!

04:55.834 --> 04:58.792
I NEED TO FIGURE OUT

04:55.834 --> 04:58.792
HOW TO CURE NEOCORTEX.

04:58.834 --> 05:02.083
AND ALSO HOW TO WORK THAT

04:58.834 --> 05:02.083
TINY LOCK ON MY DIARY.

05:02.125 --> 05:06.083
WHAT? DON'T FIX HIM!

05:02.125 --> 05:06.083
WE FINALLY HAVE

05:02.125 --> 05:06.083
SOMETHING FUN TO DO!

05:06.125 --> 05:10.083
OOH, NEOCORTEX,

05:06.125 --> 05:10.083
PUT LIZARD MAN INTO A DAYDREAM.

05:10.125 --> 05:12.083
I BET HIS FANTASY

05:10.125 --> 05:12.083
INVOLVES GODZILLA,

05:12.125 --> 05:14.667
BUT LIKE A REALLY HOT GODZILLA

05:12.125 --> 05:14.667

I ONLY HAVE FIVE DOLLARS.

06:45.167 --> 06:47.792

06:45.167 --> 06:47.792
WE'LL TAKETH IT!

06:47.834 --> 06:51.626
ALL RIGHT! READY FOR

06:47.834 --> 06:51.626
SOME QUALITY GIRL TIME?

06:51.667 --> 06:53.459
CAN I GET A "WHAT WHAT"?

06:54.626 --> 06:57.167
"WHATETH WHATETH"?

07:02.834 --> 07:04.751
DURING YOUR BATTLE

07:02.834 --> 07:04.751
WITH THE REATOMIZER,

07:04.792 --> 07:08.125
HE MUST HAVE SCRAMBLED

07:04.792 --> 07:08.125
THE NEURAL CONNECTIONS

07:04.792 --> 07:08.125
IN YOUR BRAIN.

07:08.167 --> 07:10.626
(loud whisper)

07:08.167 --> 07:10.626
PUT HIM IN A TRANCE!

07:10.667 --> 07:14.334
WOW, YOU ARE REALLY BAD

07:10.667 --> 07:14.334
AT WHISPERING.

07:14.375 --> 07:16.000
I KNOW!

07:18.125 --> 07:19.709
( whooshing )

07:19.751 --> 07:21.500
WHAT WAS THAT?

07:21.542 --> 07:23.042
UH, THAT WAS ME.

07:23.083 --> 07:25.209
I FARTED...

07:25.250 --> 07:27.250
AND THEN THAT HAPPENED.

07:27.292 --> 07:29.626
( all yawning )

07:29.667 --> 07:33.584
YOUR PSYCHIC BURST

07:29.667 --> 07:33.584
MUST HAVE RAISED

07:29.667 --> 07:33.584
EVERYONE'S MELATONIN LEVELS.

07:33.626 --> 07:36.042
WE'RE ALL GETTING DROWSY.

07:36.083 --> 07:39.584
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT A CURE

07:36.083 --> 07:39.584
FOR NEOCORTEX BEFORE

07:36.083 --> 07:39.584
HE GETS WORSE!

07:39.626 --> 07:42.000
LET'S NOT RUSH

07:39.626 --> 07:42.000
TO CURE ANYBODY.

07:42.042 --> 07:44.834
WHO ARE WE TO SAY

07:42.042 --> 07:44.834
WHO LIVES...

07:44.876 --> 07:47.709
AND WHO HAS THEIR PRIVACY

07:44.876 --> 07:47.709
INVADED FOR MY AMUSEMENT?

07:47.751 --> 07:49.167
( laughs )

07:50.834 --> 07:52.584
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ALLEY CAT?

07:56.834 --> 07:58.834
( beeping )

07:58.876 --> 08:02.792
OKAY. OKAY, SHE'S JUST

07:58.876 --> 08:02.792
HAVING A NIGHTMARE.

08:02.834 --> 08:04.792
INSTEAD OF JUMPING

08:02.834 --> 08:04.792
FROM BUILDING TO BUILDING

08:04.834 --> 08:06.959
AND LANDING ON HER FEET

08:04.834 --> 08:06.959
LIKE SHE USUALLY DOES,

08:07.000 --> 08:09.167
SHE'S FALLING INTO

08:07.000 --> 08:09.167
A BOTTOMLESS PIT.

08:09.209 --> 08:10.709
IT'S A VERY COMMON

08:09.209 --> 08:10.709
AND HARMLESS--

08:10.751 --> 08:13.751
AAAH!

08:10.751 --> 08:13.751
WHAT HAPPENED?

08:13.792 --> 08:16.834
OKAY, THAT BOTTOMLESS PIT,

08:16.876 --> 08:18.709
IT TURNS OUT IT HAD A BOTTOM.

08:18.751 --> 08:22.042
( monitor flatlining )

08:18.751 --> 08:22.042
NO.

08:22.083 --> 08:24.042
SHE HAS NO BRAIN ACTIVITY!

08:24.083 --> 08:25.959
AND NO PULSE!

08:26.000 --> 08:28.792
THAT MEANS SHE'S--

08:26.000 --> 08:28.792
Horace: DEAD.

08:28.834 --> 08:33.542
I LEFT MY CHARGER HERE

08:28.834 --> 08:33.542
AND NOW MY CELL PHONE

08:28.834 --> 08:33.542
IS COMPLETELY DEAD.

08:33.583 --> 08:34.918
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

08:34.958 --> 08:36.751
NEOCORTEX'S POWERS

08:34.958 --> 08:36.751
ARE MALFUNCTIONING

08:36.792 --> 08:38.708
AND NOW ALLEY CAT IS DEAD!

08:38.751 --> 08:39.918
OH!

08:39.958 --> 08:42.583
OKAY, YEAH, <i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> WAS </font></i> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> DEAD.</font>

08:42.626 --> 08:44.667
FORTUNATELY,

08:42.626 --> 08:44.667
ONE OF HER POWERS

08:44.709 --> 08:46.834
IS THAT SHE HAS NINE LIVES.

08:46.876 --> 08:48.667
SO SHE'S GOT EIGHT LIVES LEFT.

08:50.292 --> 08:52.709
( monitor flatlining )

08:52.751 --> 08:55.000
( monitor resumes beeping )

08:59.334 --> 09:03.500
YEAH. CORRECTION:

08:59.334 --> 09:03.500
SEVEN LIVES LEFT.

09:03.542 --> 09:06.042
SO, INSTEAD OF PUTTING

09:03.542 --> 09:06.042
PEOPLE INTO FANTASIES,

09:06.083 --> 09:08.292
NOW YOU'RE PUTTING THEM

09:06.083 --> 09:08.292
INTO NIGHTMARES?

09:08.334 --> 09:10.500
YEAH, AND THEN

09:08.334 --> 09:10.500
WHEN ALLEY CAT DIED

09:08.334 --> 09:10.500
IN HER NIGHTMARE,

09:10.542 --> 09:12.292
SHE DID IN REAL LIFE, TOO.

09:12.334 --> 09:13.959
DOES THAT MEAN

09:12.334 --> 09:13.959
THE SAME THING

09:12.334 --> 09:13.959
IS GONNA HAPPEN

09:14.000 --> 09:16.667
TO EVERYONE THAT WAS EXPOSED

09:14.000 --> 09:16.667
TO YOUR BLAST THAT FALLS ASLEEP?

09:16.709 --> 09:19.459
THAT SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.

09:19.500 --> 09:22.042
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY

09:19.500 --> 09:22.042
TO CURE NEOCORTEX!

09:22.083 --> 09:25.459
BUT UNTIL WE DO,

09:22.083 --> 09:25.459
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE

09:22.083 --> 09:25.459
NO ONE FALLS ASLEEP!

COULD YOU COMBINE

THOSE POWERS

13:06.667 --> 13:09.042
AND PROJECT MY CONSCIOUSNESS

THAT COULD HAPPEN?

13:14.083 --> 13:15.918
OLIVER'S BRAIN

13:14.083 --> 13:15.918
COULD EXPLODE.

13:15.959 --> 13:19.751
YES, OF COURSE,

I HAVE A QUESTION.

14:37.167 --> 14:38.876
HOW DO YOU GET

14:37.167 --> 14:38.876
SOMEONE TO LIKE YOU?

14:38.918 --> 14:40.876
THE ANSWER IS QUITE SIMPLE.

14:40.918 --> 14:43.918
WE LIKE THE PEOPLE

14:40.918 --> 14:43.918
WHO ARE LIKE <i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> OURSELVES.</font></i>

14:43.959 --> 14:45.876
THAT'S WHY I LIKE WALLACE.

14:43.959 --> 14:45.876
AND I LIKE CLYDE.

14:45.918 --> 14:47.042
AND WHY?

14:45.918 --> 14:47.042
WE'RE ABLE

14:47.083 --> 14:48.334
TO ALWAYS FINISH

14:47.083 --> 14:48.334
EACH OTHER'S

14:48.375 --> 14:50.834
SENT-

14:48.375 --> 14:50.834
-ERPIECES MADE OF PINECONES.

14:52.375 --> 14:54.000
OH!

14:54.042 --> 14:55.751
SO TO GET JORDAN TO LIKE ME,

14:55.792 --> 14:57.834
I SHOULD BE MORE LIKE HER.

14:55.792 --> 14:57.834
THANKS!

14:57.876 --> 15:01.000
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT AT ALL.

14:57.876 --> 15:01.000
ME NEITHER.

15:03.125 --> 15:05.459
( blows )

15:03.125 --> 15:05.459
( blows )

15:05.500 --> 15:07.918
HEY, LOOK! WE SHAKE OUR DICE

15:05.500 --> 15:07.918
THE SAME WAY!

15:07.959 --> 15:09.959
WE SURE HAVE

15:07.959 --> 15:09.959
A LOT IN COMMON.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
TO MAKE YOU LEAVE ME ALONE?

15:13.042 --> 15:15.834
OH, FINALLY!

15:13.042 --> 15:15.834
THE POWER-STEALING POTION.

15:15.876 --> 15:18.042
AND I USE IT ON <i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> YOU! </font></i>

15:15.876 --> 15:18.042
( all gasp )

15:18.083 --> 15:21.209
Both: OH, SNAPPETH.

15:21.250 --> 15:23.834
NOW YOU HAVE

15:21.250 --> 15:23.834
NO POWERS AT ALL.

15:23.876 --> 15:26.876
JUST LIKE THAT LOSER,

15:23.876 --> 15:26.876
SKYLAR STORM.

15:26.918 --> 15:31.042
WHAT. DID. YOU. SAY?

15:31.083 --> 15:32.459
I...SAID--

15:32.500 --> 15:34.167
I KNOW WHAT YOU SAID!

15:34.209 --> 15:38.292
THAT'S IT.

15:34.209 --> 15:38.292
NO MORE MR. NICE DONKEY.

15:38.334 --> 15:42.751
Clyde: THE DONKEY REARS ITS LEGS

15:38.334 --> 15:42.751
AND DELIVERS A MOST

15:38.334 --> 15:42.751
DEVASTATING KICK!

15:42.792 --> 15:44.125
LADY JORDAN REELS!

15:44.167 --> 15:47.959
THEN SHE PULLS OUT

15:44.167 --> 15:47.959
HER MACE OF DOOM

15:48.000 --> 15:50.959
AND HEAVES IT MIGHTILY!

15:51.000 --> 15:52.918
OH! BUT THE DONKEY

15:51.000 --> 15:52.918
CATCHES IT IN HER MOUTH

15:52.959 --> 15:56.250
WITH HER GIANT

15:52.959 --> 15:56.250
DONKEY BUCK TEETH!

15:56.292 --> 16:00.042
THE DONKEY HURLS IT BACK

15:56.292 --> 16:00.042
FROM WHENCE IT CAME!

16:00.083 --> 16:04.417
BUT LADY JORDAN

16:00.083 --> 16:04.417
DODGES IT IN TIME.

16:04.459 --> 16:08.792
NOW THE STUPID, DIRTY DONKEY

16:04.459 --> 16:08.792
CHARGES LIKE A BULL THAT

16:04.459 --> 16:08.792
THINKS IT'S A DONKEY.

16:08.834 --> 16:13.792
SHE BUTTS LADY JORDAN WITH

16:08.834 --> 16:13.792
HER LONG, UGLY DONKEY HEAD.

16:13.834 --> 16:17.209
SHE'S FALLEN INTO A PIT

16:13.834 --> 16:17.209
OF POISONOUS QUICKSAND!

16:17.250 --> 16:19.042
WITH MY LAST BREATH

16:19.083 --> 16:22.167
I WIELD MY MAGICAL

16:19.083 --> 16:22.167
WHIP OF GRASPING!

16:22.209 --> 16:23.751
IF I ROLL A PERFECT TWENTY.

16:24.834 --> 16:26.209
AHH..

16:26.250 --> 16:28.918
A PERFECT TWENTY!

16:28.959 --> 16:30.042
( makes whooshing sound )

16:30.083 --> 16:32.375
( gasps, groans )

16:37.167 --> 16:40.542
SHE PULLED YOU IN,

16:37.167 --> 16:40.542
YOU'RE BOTH DEAD.

16:37.167 --> 16:40.542
BRYAN, YOU'RE THE WINNER.

16:40.584 --> 16:42.083
( all cheer )

16:42.125 --> 16:47.042
YES! I AM THE LORD

16:42.125 --> 16:47.042
OF THE GARGOYLES!

16:42.125 --> 16:47.042
EXCLAMATION POINT!

16:47.083 --> 16:50.292
WHY AM I EVEN

16:47.083 --> 16:50.292
STRANGERS WITH THAT GUY?

16:55.459 --> 16:57.417
CLASS IS IN SESSION!

16:57.459 --> 17:00.000
TODAY'S LESSON: ELECTRICITY!

17:07.083 --> 17:09.876
KAZ, QUICK. THIS OF MEGAHERTZ

17:07.083 --> 17:09.876
INSIDE OF A CAGE.

17:09.917 --> 17:11.125
WHAT? WHY?

17:09.917 --> 17:11.125
JUST DO IT!

17:15.083 --> 17:17.000
GRRR! GRRR!

17:19.375 --> 17:22.416
HOW DID I DO THAT?

17:19.375 --> 17:22.416
WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:22.459 --> 17:25.166
AND WHY IS MY HAND

17:22.459 --> 17:25.166
A RAINBOW TROUT?

17:29.167 --> 17:32.042
THE GOOD NEWS IS,

17:29.167 --> 17:32.042
THIS IS ONLY A NIGHTMARE.

17:32.083 --> 17:36.042
THE BAD NEWS IS,

17:32.083 --> 17:36.042
IF MEGAHERTZ KILLS YOU,

17:32.083 --> 17:36.042
YOU'LL DIE IN REAL LIFE.

17:36.083 --> 17:37.834
WHAT?!

17:37.876 --> 17:39.584
YOU HAVE THE POWER

17:37.876 --> 17:39.584
TO DO <i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> ANYTHING </font></i> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> YOU</font>

17:37.876 --> 17:39.584
THINK YOU CAN DO

17:39.626 --> 17:41.083
IF YOU FOCUS ON IT.

17:41.125 --> 17:44.542
I CAN? THEN I KNOW

17:41.125 --> 17:44.542
EXACTLY WHAT TO DO.

17:50.334 --> 17:51.542
HOW IS THAT GOING TO HELP?

17:51.584 --> 17:54.000
IT ALWAYS HELPS

17:51.584 --> 17:54.000
TO HAVE A COOL COAT.

17:56.042 --> 17:58.042
( electricity crackling )

17:58.083 --> 18:00.000
KAZ, QUICK.

17:58.083 --> 18:00.000
GET IN THE LOCKER.

18:05.125 --> 18:10.375
YOU TICKED OFF

18:05.125 --> 18:10.375
THE WRONG HALF-HUMAN HALF-CYBORG

18:05.125 --> 18:10.375
SUBSTITUTE TEACHER!

18:13.459 --> 18:15.000
( growls )

18:45.667 --> 18:48.417
( groaning )

18:48.459 --> 18:50.959
OLIVER! HE'S TOO POWERFUL!

18:48.459 --> 18:50.959
HELP ME!

18:51.000 --> 18:55.042
I CAN'T. I'M NOT REALLY HERE.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.042
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

18:55.083 --> 18:58.000
YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:55.083 --> 18:58.000
I HAVE TO RELY ON MYSELF.

19:04.334 --> 19:06.542
DUDE, I COULD USE

19:04.334 --> 19:06.542
A HAND HERE.

19:06.584 --> 19:08.125
YOU GOT IT, KAZ.

19:15.667 --> 19:17.500
( growls )

19:27.792 --> 19:29.709
( growls )

19:55.083 --> 19:56.542
THAT...

19:56.584 --> 19:58.042
WAS...

19:58.083 --> 20:00.500
AWESOME!

20:00.542 --> 20:02.042
KAZ IS ALIVE!

20:02.083 --> 20:03.542
WELL DONE, BOYS!

20:03.584 --> 20:05.709
HEY. THANKS FOR BEING

20:03.584 --> 20:05.709
THERE FOR ME, OLIVER.

20:05.751 --> 20:08.042
ANYTIME, BUDDY.

20:05.751 --> 20:08.042
JUST SAY THE WORD.

20:08.083 --> 20:09.500
WHAT WORD?

20:09.542 --> 20:12.292
I DON'T KNOW.

20:09.542 --> 20:12.292
"HELP," I GUESS.

20:13.542 --> 20:16.334
BEFORE WE START CELEBRATING,

20:13.542 --> 20:16.334
WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

20:16.375 --> 20:18.751
Kaz: EVERYONE'S ASLEEP!

20:18.792 --> 20:21.042
SORRY. MY PARTY HORN BROKE.

20:21.083 --> 20:23.250
AND THIS SHOE HORN MAKES

20:21.083 --> 20:23.250
NO NOISE WHATSOEVER!

20:26.292 --> 20:28.250
WE HAVE TO GO INTO THEIR

20:26.292 --> 20:28.250
NIGHTMARES AND SAVE THEM!

20:28.292 --> 20:29.667
WE DON'T HAVE

20:28.292 --> 20:29.667
ANY TIME!

20:29.709 --> 20:31.542
ALL WE CAN DO IS HOPE

20:29.709 --> 20:31.542
FOR A MIRACLE!

20:38.500 --> 20:41.500
OH. THAT WAS EASY.

20:41.542 --> 20:44.584
THE LUNAR ECLIPSE

20:41.542 --> 20:44.584
MUST HAVE BEEN WHAT

20:41.542 --> 20:44.584
WAS MESSING WITH MY POWERS

20:44.626 --> 20:47.000
BECAUSE I CAN READ MINDS

20:44.626 --> 20:47.000
CLEARLY NOW.

20:49.083 --> 20:50.292
YOU'RE BORED AGAIN,

20:49.083 --> 20:50.292
AREN'T YOU?

20:50.334 --> 20:52.751
I'M <i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> SO </font></i> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> BORED!</font>

20:52.792 --> 20:56.542
NOTHING COOL HAS HAPPENED

20:52.792 --> 20:56.542
IN, LIKE, TWENTY SECONDS!

21:00.709 --> 21:02.834
YA KNOW, I NEVER

21:00.709 --> 21:02.834
REALLY LIKED YOU

21:02.876 --> 21:04.500
'CAUSE I THOUGHT

21:02.876 --> 21:04.500
YOU WERE A GOODY-GOODY,

21:04.542 --> 21:08.042
BUT YOU'RE MUCH TOUGHER

21:04.542 --> 21:08.042
AND MEANER THAN I EVER IMAGINED.

21:08.083 --> 21:10.834
AW. <i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> THANK </font></i> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> YOU!</font>

21:10.876 --> 21:13.083
THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME

21:13.125 --> 21:16.626
COMING FROM SOMEONE

21:13.125 --> 21:16.626
AS INSENSITIVE AND

21:13.125 --> 21:16.626
COLD-BLOODED AS YOU.

21:16.667 --> 21:20.375
AW. THANK YOU!

21:20.417 --> 21:22.042
I FEEL WEIRD.

21:22.083 --> 21:25.375
MAYBE I'M TIRED OR MAYBE

21:22.083 --> 21:25.375
IT'S THE LUNAR ECLIPSE,

21:25.417 --> 21:27.042
BUT I-I FEEL--

21:27.083 --> 21:29.584
FRIENDLY?

21:27.083 --> 21:29.584
YES!

21:32.083 --> 21:34.250
YA KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHY

21:32.083 --> 21:34.250
I'M ADMITTING THIS TO YOU,

21:34.292 --> 21:36.792
MAYBE I'M TIRED, MAYBE

21:34.292 --> 21:36.792
IT WAS THE LUNAR ECLIPSE,

21:36.834 --> 21:39.792
BUT...

21:36.834 --> 21:39.792
YOU'RE ACTUALLY CLYDE.

21:40.959 --> 21:42.500
I KNEW IT!

21:43.626 --> 21:45.792
BECAUSE I CAN'T

21:43.626 --> 21:45.792
SEE ANYTHING!

21:49.959 --> 21:51.834
SO MUCH BETTER.

21:49.959 --> 21:51.834
RIGHT?
