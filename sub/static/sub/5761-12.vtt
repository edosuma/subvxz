WEBVTT

00:09.100 --> 00:11.400
My name is 
Melinda Gordon.

00:11.500 --> 00:12.700
I'm married,

00:12.800 --> 00:15.000
I live in a small town,

00:15.100 --> 00:16.900
and I own an antique shop.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
I might be just like you.

00:19.100 --> 00:20.800
Except that from time
I was a little girl,

00:20.900 --> 00:23.300
I knew that I could
talk to the dead.

00:23.400 --> 00:24.600
It's all right, honey.

00:24.700 --> 00:27.800
Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them.

00:27.908 --> 00:30.300
They're stuck here because they have
unfinished business with the living

00:30.403 --> 00:34.107
and they come to me for help.

00:35.706 --> 00:41.105
In order to tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.

00:43.404 --> 00:47.606
- He sure is good looking.
- And he's completely unaware of it.

00:47.709 --> 00:50.502
Bob has no idea of the effect
he has on women.

00:50.605 --> 00:53.002
And a sharp dresser.
Check out the tie.

00:53.105 --> 00:55.401
Well, you know what they say.
The clothes make the man.

00:55.508 --> 00:57.400
And the dog.

00:57.507 --> 01:00.402
This is amazing. I mean,
I've heard a lot about therapy dogs.

01:00.505 --> 01:01.600
How did you get him into it?

01:01.707 --> 01:05.200
Well, he's just always been so good
with people, especially children.

01:05.308 --> 01:08.803
He had to go through some training,
but he's the perfect dog for it.

01:08.908 --> 01:12.901
- He's huggable. He's patient.
- And you do this every weekend?

01:13.008 --> 01:15.200
Whenever we can.

01:15.306 --> 01:18.400
This hospital was really
great to my husband.

01:18.505 --> 01:21.403
They did everything they could
to try and save him.

01:21.505 --> 01:24.602
Everybody was really kind.

01:24.708 --> 01:28.102
Anyway, we have some more stops
to make. Are you in a rush? - No.

01:28.205 --> 01:30.501
Good.

01:48.605 --> 01:51.002
Hey, Bob!
How ya doin', boy?

01:51.106 --> 01:51.903
Ooh, nice tie.

01:52.007 --> 01:55.803
Notice how Bob gets all the attention
and we're just the appendages
who happen to be nearby.

01:55.908 --> 01:57.600
Oh, don't forget your donation
for the silent auction.

01:57.706 --> 02:00.401
Oh, I won't. I have so much stuff.
Don't worry.

02:00.507 --> 02:01.803
Oh, you know what?
I forgot to ask her something.

02:01.905 --> 02:04.702
Can you please hold bob?
Thank you so much. I'll be right back.

02:04.805 --> 02:06.601
Violet!

02:06.706 --> 02:08.803
Bob.

02:08.907 --> 02:10.601
Ok.

02:10.707 --> 02:12.202
Let's go this way.

02:12.306 --> 02:14.403
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, my god, I am so sorry.

02:14.508 --> 02:17.403
My fault. My fault.
Oh, gosh.

02:17.507 --> 02:22.503
- Oh, beautiful dog. May I?
- Oh, yeah, of course.

02:27.407 --> 02:30.202
Are you all right?

02:30.306 --> 02:33.300
I've just had a really tough day.

02:33.405 --> 02:37.302
And he reminds me of a dog
we used to have. Don't you?

02:37.406 --> 02:39.301
Is there anything I can do?

02:39.406 --> 02:41.702
No. Thank you.

02:41.806 --> 02:45.002
Just enjoy your day.

02:45.106 --> 02:47.101
I mean it.

02:47.208 --> 02:49.900
Enjoy everything.

02:50.006 --> 02:51.601
Friend of yours?

02:51.707 --> 02:55.000
Uh, new friend of Bob's.

02:55.107 --> 02:57.003
Did she look familiar to you?

02:57.105 --> 02:59.000
You know, I really
didn't see her that well.

02:59.107 --> 03:01.002
I swear I've seen her somewhere.

03:01.106 --> 03:04.001
Anyway, I need to use the restroom
and then get going.

03:04.106 --> 03:06.200
They're through those
double doors, I think.

03:06.307 --> 03:09.103
Ok. Bye, bob.

03:22.508 --> 03:25.101
Excuse me.

03:36.106 --> 03:37.301
Can I help you?

03:37.406 --> 03:39.401
I'm looking for a rest room.

03:39.506 --> 03:42.001
Well, you won't find it here.

03:42.106 --> 03:44.702
Ok. Sorry.

03:51.707 --> 03:53.500
Let me show you.

03:53.606 --> 03:55.000
It's right here.

03:55.105 --> 03:58.903
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

04:59.705 --> 05:03.300
EPISODE 2x12
Dead To Rights

05:10.108 --> 05:13.300
I was looking forward
to a nice toasty store.

05:13.406 --> 05:14.301
It's freezing in here.

05:14.408 --> 05:18.001
Oh, sorry. I just needed some
fresh air. I was feeling a little
claustrophobic today.

05:18.108 --> 05:21.800
- Is it ok if I close the door?
- Sure.

05:21.905 --> 05:23.403
Hey, what's in that box?

05:23.505 --> 05:25.102
Oh,  the donations for the hospital.

05:25.207 --> 05:27.103
Ah! The silent auction.
I totally forgot.

05:27.208 --> 05:29.401
- Are you taking this in today?
- Yeah. After work.

05:29.508 --> 05:32.501
If I can get ned to bring everything
by and it in the back of your truck?

05:32.605 --> 05:35.001
- Yes. I will add it to the haul.
- Excellent.

05:35.105 --> 05:37.800
Ned. Ned, I left everything
in a bag by the door.

05:37.907 --> 05:39.800
If you could just bring
it by after school.

05:39.907 --> 05:41.800
But I have volleyball practice.

05:41.908 --> 05:45.702
That's at 4:00. That leaves you
40 minutes. It'll only take you 20.

05:45.805 --> 05:48.402
- Ok.
- Oh, shanka sho musch.

05:48.506 --> 05:51.400
I know. It's a bummer.
I'll see you after school.

05:51.506 --> 05:54.000
I am gonna make myself some tea.

05:54.105 --> 05:56.502
Sorry.

06:40.607 --> 06:42.102
Are you ok?

06:42.207 --> 06:43.902
Yeah. Uh...

06:44.007 --> 06:47.002
nasty leg cramp.

06:54.006 --> 06:56.300
- There you go.
- Thanks.

06:56.408 --> 06:59.002
So, 2 creepy visions,
but no ghosts.

06:59.105 --> 07:01.200
Yeah. Someone's trying
to tell me something.

07:01.308 --> 07:02.700
What?

07:02.805 --> 07:07.803
I just keep gettin this feeling
like I can't breathe, can't move.

07:07.907 --> 07:09.401
Why do they gotta make
everything a riddle?

07:09.507 --> 07:11.503
Why do they a play
these games with you?

07:11.605 --> 07:13.502
They communicate with me
the only way they can.

07:13.605 --> 07:16.000
Yeah. Well, it makes it
really hard to know what to do.

07:16.106 --> 07:17.900
I'm gonna start with the obituaries,

07:18.006 --> 07:21.600
see if I can find an stories
on deaths in mental hospitals.

07:21.705 --> 07:24.201
Maybe that's why I was in
a straitjacket in the vision.

07:24.306 --> 07:25.901
That's a great way
to spend the afternoon.

07:26.005 --> 07:29.801
That's why god created coffee.

07:33.708 --> 07:35.303
So, where do I put the stuff
for this auction?

07:35.406 --> 07:37.702
Just right here on the table.
That looks heavy.

07:37.806 --> 07:39.503
Did your mom make you
throw out your video games?

07:39.605 --> 07:42.301
Nah. It's just some random stuff.

07:42.408 --> 07:45.401
- Need some help?
- No, thanks.

07:45.507 --> 07:49.401
Obituaries. Whoa.
Are we doing some ghost business?

07:49.506 --> 07:51.101
We are not doing anything.

07:51.206 --> 07:53.301
I just thought you might want
to bounce some stuff off of me,

07:53.406 --> 07:56.602
since, well, you know, I know.

07:56.708 --> 08:00.101
Thanks. That's sweet.
But it's kind of a solo act.

08:00.207 --> 08:02.502
Whatever. I had
volleyball practice anyway.

08:02.605 --> 08:05.600
But I'm on cell.

08:14.607 --> 08:16.802
Hey, Ned, wait a minute.

08:16.906 --> 08:18.402
I knew you'd see it my way.

08:18.507 --> 08:20.400
This is your dad's stuff, isn't it?

08:20.507 --> 08:21.602
Yeah. So?

08:21.708 --> 08:24.503
So, I'm surprised that Delia
would want to get rid of it.

08:24.605 --> 08:25.602
Are you...

08:25.708 --> 08:28.002
you sure that you grabbed
the right box?

08:28.107 --> 08:30.200
Yeah. That's the one.
Definitely.

08:30.305 --> 08:35.503
Ok. Well, I'm not sure how much you're
gonna be able to get for this hat.

08:35.607 --> 08:37.802
Bye.

09:48.505 --> 09:50.002
I'm listening, honey.
I'm listening.

09:50.105 --> 09:51.903
You have no idea
how horrible it was.

09:52.008 --> 09:54.903
I was using all my strength, 
my whole being,

09:55.008 --> 09:57.300
just to even move my little finger
and say that I was alive

09:57.407 --> 09:58.803
and that I could feel it.

09:58.908 --> 10:00.100
Honey, I still don't get it.

10:00.208 --> 10:02.403
I mean, the ghost was killed
by an undertaker?

10:02.508 --> 10:03.903
They thought he or she was dead,
but he wasn't?

10:04.005 --> 10:05.601
They died in some kind of surgery?

10:05.708 --> 10:07.301
The ghost was obviously
feeling helpless.

10:07.405 --> 10:09.602
There  was stuff being done to it
that it couldn't stop,

10:09.706 --> 10:12.703
that it didn't want, but what
was I supposed to do about it?

10:12.808 --> 10:15.901
All  right, just tell me how
this vision was different
than your other visions.

10:16.007 --> 10:20.002
You know, I mean,
how you felt about it or something.

10:20.107 --> 10:23.602
Well, in this one I left my body.

10:23.808 --> 10:28.601
Like I died and I could see
everything around me.

10:29.408 --> 10:31.702
Look, maybe this ghost, uh...

10:31.805 --> 10:33.401
just wants people to know
what happened to it.

10:33.508 --> 10:35.000
You know, whatever it was,

10:35.103 --> 10:37.807
what he felt,
if they were aware of it.

10:37.906 --> 10:42.905
Maybe you should check, see if
anybody died in a funeral home,
freak accidents, surgery.

10:43.004 --> 10:45.106
Do you feel it?

10:45.209 --> 10:47.402
Feel what?

10:47.505 --> 10:51.502
Do you feel anything on your back?

10:52.505 --> 10:53.903
No, honey. What...

10:54.005 --> 10:55.401
There's...
I don't feel anything.

10:55.505 --> 10:58.301
There's nothing.

10:58.407 --> 11:01.003
What is it, Mel?

11:01.108 --> 11:03.402
What?

11:05.006 --> 11:08.400
"Srom itcelid." Is this a new
character in Lemony Snicket book?

11:08.505 --> 11:09.703
Do I look amused?

11:09.807 --> 11:13.202
No. You look grumpy and mildly tired,
yet oddly bewitching.

11:13.308 --> 11:16.001
- Does it mean anything or not?
- Not. Is...

11:16.108 --> 11:17.902
Is it a secret code?
Is it a sorority?

11:18.007 --> 11:20.200
- Can you put it in context for me?
- My husband's back.

11:20.308 --> 11:21.400
As in a tattoo?

11:21.507 --> 11:25.801
As in it appeared on his back
as if someone was writing it
and then disappeared.

11:25.905 --> 11:28.700
You know how to put a slight spin
on someone's day, don't you?

11:28.808 --> 11:30.002
Welcome to my world.

11:30.105 --> 11:31.602
Is there any way he can
come into my office.

11:31.705 --> 11:33.601
'Cause then maybe it would
happen again and I could do some...

11:33.706 --> 11:36.601
No. I just need to know what it means,
if it means anything.

11:36.705 --> 11:39.000
I need more information.
I'm sorry.

11:39.105 --> 11:40.903
I'm trying to unravel a haunting.

11:41.005 --> 11:43.403
It either has to do with a mental
patient who died in an institution

11:43.505 --> 11:46.301
or somebody who died on
the embalming table at a mortuary.

11:46.406 --> 11:49.000
Ok. There is actual hair standing up
on the back of my neck.

11:49.106 --> 11:50.103
Would you like to feel it?

11:50.205 --> 11:52.303
I will take your word for it.

11:52.405 --> 11:55.800
- Look, professor Payne...
- Rick.

11:55.905 --> 12:01.100
I just want you to know that
it's not just me who took a chance
when I told you what I could do.

12:01.205 --> 12:02.603
The weird things that
have been happening to you,

12:02.708 --> 12:06.402
- the things that have been moved...
- Things that are still happening.

12:06.505 --> 12:09.100
This can really invade your life.

12:09.208 --> 12:12.001
It's all right. I've been through
worse. I was in a bar in Philly...

12:12.106 --> 12:14.801
I'm serious.

12:15.205 --> 12:18.400
Well, maybe I've been waiting
for something to invade my life
for a long time.

12:18.507 --> 12:20.800
Maybe this is just what I needed.

12:20.905 --> 12:22.501
I'm gonna go figure this out.

12:22.606 --> 12:23.801
I'll get back to you.

12:23.905 --> 12:27.000
- Thank you.
- Sure.

12:27.108 --> 12:29.500
If I wanted to give this stuff away,
I would have put it in the box myself.

12:29.606 --> 12:30.403
Then why didn't you?

12:30.505 --> 12:32.400
Hey, I don't have to answer
to a 13-year-old.

12:32.505 --> 12:34.000
I'm your mother and
you'll do what I say.

12:34.105 --> 12:38.300
- You always tell me I can be myself.
- You had no right to take these.

12:38.408 --> 12:39.500
What were you thinking?

12:39.606 --> 12:41.900
These are your father's things, Ned.

12:42.005 --> 12:44.301
Think I don't know that?

12:44.407 --> 12:45.902
What is wrong with you?

12:46.008 --> 12:48.302
- I am so damn furious...
- I don't get it!

12:48.406 --> 12:50.300
- What's the big deal?
- Oh, you get it.

12:50.405 --> 12:52.503
And you know you get it.

12:52.607 --> 12:59.600
You are just lucky I figured out
what you were trying to do
before it was too late.

13:00.906 --> 13:04.003
Oh, god. I am so sorry you
had to hear all that.

13:04.106 --> 13:06.201
No, it's ok.

13:06.307 --> 13:07.201
What happened?

13:07.308 --> 13:09.403
I have no idea
what's gotten into him.

13:09.506 --> 13:14.002
I'm just gonna bring
this all to the car.

13:15.905 --> 13:17.001
So, Ned,

13:17.105 --> 13:19.500
you want to talk about why
you pulled such a loser move?

13:19.605 --> 13:22.102
It wasn't a loser move.

13:22.205 --> 13:27.300
Ok, you want to come out here
and tell me what's up?

13:27.906 --> 13:29.400
What's up is,

13:29.505 --> 13:31.502
I'm sick of seeing mom
sad all the time.

13:31.607 --> 13:33.602
Ned, I don't think
she's sad all the time.

13:33.706 --> 13:36.202
That's because she's good
at putting on a happy face.

13:36.305 --> 13:38.000
Try living with her.

13:38.106 --> 13:41.401
She cries every
single day about dad.

13:41.507 --> 13:44.403
It's like she hopes
he's still alive somewhere.

13:44.506 --> 13:48.102
She just won't let him go.

13:49.006 --> 13:50.801
Say that again.

13:50.907 --> 13:52.000
What?

13:52.108 --> 13:55.302
The part about still being alive
and not wanting to let him go.

13:55.408 --> 13:56.801
So?

13:56.908 --> 13:59.602
Ned, I really want to finish
this conversation, ok?

13:59.706 --> 14:04.701
You're in charge of the store.
I'll be right back.

14:30.606 --> 14:33.502
Please stop it!

14:33.705 --> 14:35.601
No!

14:35.706 --> 14:38.101
Please!

14:40.507 --> 14:42.000
No. No. Please.

14:42.106 --> 14:45.401
Please don't. Please!

14:49.505 --> 14:52.200
Please stop!

15:02.608 --> 15:05.100
Found it.

15:35.508 --> 15:38.902
Hi. Uh, I'm lost again.

15:39.106 --> 15:41.800
Do you know where I could find
the coffee machine?

15:41.906 --> 15:44.102
No.

15:45.505 --> 15:50.101
Well, you seem pretty sure
about that, so...

15:58.405 --> 16:00.801
Great.

16:08.205 --> 16:09.900
I got these out of the recycling bin.

16:10.008 --> 16:12.901
Oh, thanks. Just dump 'em
on the table.

16:13.005 --> 16:15.202
- Can I help you go through these?
- Thanks. But I have to.

16:15.306 --> 16:17.100
You know, it's just that woman
I saw at the bedside,

16:17.206 --> 16:18.101
she looked so familiar.

16:18.206 --> 16:20.300
I know that I have seen her
in the news.

16:20.407 --> 16:21.400
Maybe on TV?

16:21.505 --> 16:26.801
Maybe. But I think it was a magazine.
Some sort of family thing.

16:26.906 --> 16:29.200
Are you sure you found this ghost?

16:29.306 --> 16:30.303
Yeah. Yeah.

16:30.405 --> 16:32.700
I saw his energy, I guess,
hovering over the bed.

16:32.808 --> 16:34.402
He was hooked up
to all these machines.

16:34.507 --> 16:37.602
There were wires all around him,
just like I've been seeing
in the visions.

16:37.708 --> 16:38.600
How'd you find him?

16:38.705 --> 16:40.303
It was actually something Ned said.

16:40.405 --> 16:42.102
Do you remember last year
when I had that ghost

16:42.206 --> 16:45.402
who was brain dead but he could only
come to me when he flatlined?

16:45.506 --> 16:47.500
Well, it made me realize
that this ghost may still be alive

16:47.607 --> 16:48.602
but trapped in his own body.

16:48.708 --> 16:50.703
And he hates the things
that are being done to him,

16:50.806 --> 16:53.402
but  he still has a message he has
to get across to me or someone else.

16:53.506 --> 16:57.603
And it makes total sense with everything
that I've been seeing and feeling.

16:57.708 --> 16:59.102
It makes sense to me. 

16:59.205 --> 17:03.203
Anyway, I think that he attached himself
to me when I was at the hospital.

17:03.307 --> 17:05.002
But how can you tell...

17:05.107 --> 17:07.902
Hey! Wait.
This is it.

17:08.008 --> 17:09.601
This is the spirit.

17:09.704 --> 17:12.501
Hugh Bristow.

17:15.906 --> 17:17.202
He's been brain dead for months.

17:17.306 --> 17:19.300
There's a big court battle over it.

17:19.407 --> 17:20.903
I read about that.

17:21.005 --> 17:22.099
He  had A.L.S., Right?

17:22.205 --> 17:23.303
Yeah. Lou Gehrig's disease.

17:23.406 --> 17:26.203
His wife took him to some
mysterious clinic in Europe.

17:26.307 --> 17:28.403
He was in a coma right after.

17:28.608 --> 17:30.101
Well, rich family.
Keeping him on life support, huh?

17:30.206 --> 17:32.600
Yeah. Now his wife
wants to pull the plug.

17:32.707 --> 17:33.802
Nice.

17:33.906 --> 17:37.003
You know, he was only married for
a month before he went into a coma?

17:37.108 --> 17:41.603
The family thinks she just wants
his money and that somehow
she put him into this coma.

17:41.705 --> 17:43.301
How are you gonna get to this guy?

17:43.405 --> 17:46.401
You said the family has guards.
They feel like they're under siege.

17:46.505 --> 17:50.102
But I have a secret weapon.

18:03.606 --> 18:06.403
Come on, Bob.

18:08.905 --> 18:09.901
Are you kidding me?

18:10.007 --> 18:12.600
Oh, he's a therapy dog.
She met him a couple of days ago.

18:12.707 --> 18:15.302
That's all right, Ben.

18:15.406 --> 18:16.700
I remember you.

18:16.808 --> 18:20.202
Yeah. We were just making our rounds
and I thought maybe you could use
some company.

18:20.308 --> 18:23.802
Well, I don't know
if he can go in there.

18:23.908 --> 18:27.902
I'd have to check with the doctor.

18:28.307 --> 18:30.602
But I could always go for a break.

18:30.708 --> 18:32.101
Do you want to go for a break?

18:32.208 --> 18:34.100
Ok. Is that good?

18:34.206 --> 18:36.900
Yes, you are a good dog.

18:37.008 --> 18:40.000
- Come on.
- Oh! You lead.

18:40.106 --> 18:44.503
You know, my husband doesn't even
have a tie that nice.

18:44.606 --> 18:49.502
Gosh, there's nothing like
some doggy love, huh?

18:50.508 --> 18:54.003
And it gives bill a chance
to talk to our son.

18:54.107 --> 18:56.600
Bill thinks it's important
to talk to him.

18:56.705 --> 18:58.502
You know, in case he hears us.

18:58.608 --> 19:02.402
This must be such
a hard time for you.

19:02.508 --> 19:03.802
You have no idea.

19:03.907 --> 19:05.900
Come on.

19:06.008 --> 19:09.203
And then there are all the lawyers
and the reporters.

19:09.306 --> 19:11.002
I'm so sorry.

19:11.106 --> 19:14.000
You must need your privacy
in a time like this.

19:14.105 --> 19:16.603
Well, thanks to her,
that's impossible.

19:16.707 --> 19:18.903
Come on.

19:19.005 --> 19:22.403
You're being polite. I'm sure
you've heard it all over the news.

19:22.508 --> 19:24.201
I know there's a conflict.

19:24.305 --> 19:26.103
You are polite.

19:26.208 --> 19:30.000
I guess "conflict" is a good word for a
wife who's trying to kill her husband.

19:30.105 --> 19:32.901
After having failed once before.

19:33.008 --> 19:34.500
My son trusted her.

19:34.605 --> 19:36.003
He said he loved her.

19:36.106 --> 19:38.402
But maybe that's just
because we didn't.

19:38.505 --> 19:40.203
Help them.

19:40.308 --> 19:42.702
Please.

19:42.805 --> 19:44.401
Help them.

19:44.508 --> 19:45.900
Then he said, "help them."

19:46.008 --> 19:48.602
That's easy. Sounds like you're
describing an astral projection.

19:48.706 --> 19:50.202
That's an out-of-body experience?

19:50.306 --> 19:52.901
Or an O.B.E., as we pretentious
experts like to say.

19:53.005 --> 19:58.202
An energy body or an astral body
carries the consciousness
from the physical body.

19:58.308 --> 20:01.702
And the energy would have to stay close
to the physical body, wouldn't it?

20:01.805 --> 20:03.400
Well, that depends on
how advanced the energy is.

20:03.506 --> 20:05.101
Some people say they
travel to other planets

20:05.205 --> 20:07.800
where no doubt they have wonderful
conversations about all this.

20:07.907 --> 20:09.400
What about the silver cord?

20:09.506 --> 20:12.800
Umbilical cord? Keeps the soul
tethered to the body, and if you...

20:12.907 --> 20:14.200
cut that cord,

20:14.306 --> 20:16.802
you're going to be spending
a lot of time with Elvis.
What's this all about?

20:16.905 --> 20:21.303
Turns out that my ghost is not a ghost.
He's in a coma on life support.

20:21.407 --> 20:23.102
Wait a minute. He's...

20:23.207 --> 20:26.303
- He's astral projecting at you?
- That's one way to put it.

20:26.406 --> 20:27.600
What does he want?

20:27.708 --> 20:30.300
I think he wants to cut
the cord once and for all.

20:30.407 --> 20:32.001
You think this entity speaks latin?

20:32.106 --> 20:33.102
I don't know. Why?

20:33.208 --> 20:38.301
Well, that message that
was on your husband's back.

20:39.808 --> 20:41.500
Mors dilecti.

20:41.605 --> 20:42.601
It's latin.

20:42.706 --> 20:44.102
Why do you think
it was written backwards?

20:44.205 --> 20:46.701
You said this was written 
on Jim's back, right?

20:46.807 --> 20:50.003
Well, maybe it was written
from the inside.

20:50.105 --> 20:51.000
Do you know what it means?

20:51.107 --> 20:52.800
Do I know what I means?
Me, the guy with "professor"

20:52.907 --> 20:54.101
in front of his name
on the red door over there?

20:54.205 --> 20:55.700
- Well?
- Yes, I know what I means.

20:55.808 --> 20:58.300
Aren't you even impressed
that I figured out the whole
latin backwards thing?

20:58.406 --> 21:00.602
- I worked the mirror in...
- You have no idea what it means, do you?

21:00.705 --> 21:02.601
I  know what it means.
It's the...

21:02.708 --> 21:05.502
it's roughly translated from latin,

21:05.605 --> 21:09.003
"the body of a crime,"
the body or the proof...

21:09.108 --> 21:11.301
proof that a crime
has been committed.

21:11.406 --> 21:12.501
That makes no sense.

21:12.707 --> 21:15.200
Oh, like a phantom writing on
your husband's back makes sense?

21:15.307 --> 21:16.602
Will you just check it for me?

21:16.708 --> 21:17.802
You wound me.

21:17.907 --> 21:22.700
- Bound to happen.
- The first cut's always the deepest.

21:22.808 --> 21:24.700
Did anything else weird
happen with your back?

21:24.808 --> 21:27.001
No one's used it as a notepad today,
if that's what you mean.

21:27.105 --> 21:31.001
- Where are you?
- I'm at the Bristows' house.

21:31.105 --> 21:33.301
I just want to see
if I can talk to his wife.

21:33.405 --> 21:35.000
Why?

21:35.108 --> 21:36.200
I don't know.

21:36.306 --> 21:39.400
Just get her side of it, I guess.

21:39.505 --> 21:43.502
I couldn't bring myself to tell his
parents that I could see his spirit.

21:43.608 --> 21:46.300
Ooh, here she is.
I gotta go.

21:46.407 --> 21:47.903
Bye.

21:48.006 --> 21:50.202
Hi.

21:51.207 --> 21:53.803
- You just won't stop, will you?
- I'm sorry?

21:53.905 --> 21:56.602
You just won't leave me alone!
You bastard!

21:56.706 --> 21:59.202
You no-good bastard!

21:59.306 --> 22:02.800
You... leave... me... alone!

22:03.105 --> 22:04.400
You want a story?

22:04.507 --> 22:06.002
Here's a story for you!

22:06.105 --> 22:09.101
Gold-digger wife!

22:09.705 --> 22:12.403
How's that?!

22:27.705 --> 22:30.000
Do you have to print that?

22:30.108 --> 22:32.201
I'm not a reporter.

22:32.307 --> 22:33.602
What are you?

22:33.706 --> 22:36.402
Detective, then?
A private eye mommy and daddy hired?

22:36.507 --> 22:39.002
No. I'm just someone
who wants to help.

22:39.106 --> 22:39.902
You look...

22:40.008 --> 22:41.401
it's this simple.

22:41.505 --> 22:44.202
Hugh didn't want to be
hooked up to machines.

22:44.305 --> 22:46.300
He told me so.

22:46.407 --> 22:48.201
Ok. Well, did he
put it in his will?

22:48.307 --> 22:50.803
No. But he was my husband.

22:50.905 --> 22:51.901
We talked.

22:52.007 --> 22:53.902
He told me things.

22:54.006 --> 22:56.400
And I'm not going to let
their big money and their

22:56.506 --> 23:00.702
big lawyers stop me from trying
to do what Hugh wanted.

23:00.806 --> 23:02.301
You tell them that.

23:02.408 --> 23:06.303
You tell them I'm not giving up.

23:25.007 --> 23:27.800
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:28.707 --> 23:30.901
Hey. What you doin'?

23:31.007 --> 23:33.303
Oh, I'm just sorting some things.

23:33.406 --> 23:34.801
You?

23:34.906 --> 23:37.403
Nothin'.

23:40.405 --> 23:42.102
I don't like to fight with you.

23:42.206 --> 23:44.902
Me neither.

23:45.406 --> 23:49.703
Maybe I should have asked you
why you did what you did

23:49.808 --> 23:52.001
before yelling at you.

23:52.106 --> 23:55.400
So I'm asking you now.

23:55.705 --> 23:58.600
Why did you want to get rid of
all your dad's stuff?

23:58.707 --> 24:01.701
It makes you sad.

24:02.206 --> 24:04.100
It helps me remember.

24:04.205 --> 24:06.900
It seems like the same thing.

24:07.006 --> 24:09.003
Sometimes remembering...

24:09.107 --> 24:12.100
does make you sad.

24:12.206 --> 24:16.802
Sometimes it makes you smile.
Sometimes it makes you feel grateful.

24:16.906 --> 24:19.800
Sometimes it reminds you of...

24:19.906 --> 24:22.700
the good life you had
with somebody...

24:22.807 --> 24:26.003
and all the things they gave you.

24:26.108 --> 24:28.302
Ned, it's just a...

24:28.406 --> 24:29.800
a big jumble of things.

24:29.906 --> 24:31.001
There's grief,

24:31.105 --> 24:32.100
there's joy,

24:32.205 --> 24:35.200
there's anger...

24:35.806 --> 24:38.701
there are so many emotions,
you just have to figure out a way

24:38.805 --> 24:42.100
to sort through them.

24:43.405 --> 24:45.900
I don't know how.

24:46.005 --> 24:50.000
Well, I got a news flash for you.

24:54.906 --> 24:57.002
Neither do I.

24:57.105 --> 24:59.703
Neither does anybody.

24:59.805 --> 25:03.700
You just have to work through it,
feel the feelings.

25:03.808 --> 25:06.800
Just takes time.

25:07.405 --> 25:10.101
How much time?

25:10.207 --> 25:11.602
Well...

25:11.707 --> 25:15.201
all I can tell you is that every day

25:15.306 --> 25:18.300
it starts to hurt a little less.

25:18.406 --> 25:20.901
Does that mean I'll forget about him?

25:21.008 --> 25:23.803
Oh, no, kiddo.

25:24.607 --> 25:27.400
You will never forget him.

25:27.507 --> 25:30.602
And neither will I.

25:35.407 --> 25:39.003
And having said all that...

25:39.105 --> 25:42.500
I think you were right.

25:42.607 --> 25:44.601
About what?

25:44.705 --> 25:48.503
Maybe I do hang on to too much stuff.

25:48.607 --> 25:48.903
But...

25:49.006 --> 25:51.302
Maybe if we gave some of it away...

25:51.405 --> 25:52.403
not all of it,

25:52.507 --> 25:55.400
but some of it,

25:55.705 --> 26:02.502
it'll be like your dad's still out there
making other people smile, not just us.

26:02.807 --> 26:07.300
Ok.

26:07.306 --> 26:09.300
Except...

26:09.408 --> 26:13.302
I vote for letting go of
the beer can cap.

26:13.406 --> 26:16.503
My thought exactly.

26:16.706 --> 26:18.603
All right, why don't you go
get the box? It's in the back.

26:18.706 --> 26:23.302
I'm going to take Bob
for a quick walk, ok?

26:25.605 --> 26:27.403
Ooh! Sorry. I just had
a few errands to...

26:27.508 --> 26:29.200
Hey, no problem.

26:29.308 --> 26:32.503
Ned and I have a few things
that we want to donate
to the hospital after all.

26:32.607 --> 26:35.300
The box is a little lighter,
but he's in the back getting it.

26:35.407 --> 26:38.001
- Ok. Well, I'll take it by later.
- Oh, it's ok. I can do it.

26:38.106 --> 26:40.902
No, I have to go by there anyway.
If you can do me a favor.

26:41.005 --> 26:41.503
Sure.

26:41.608 --> 26:44.300
Could I borrow Bob again?

26:44.408 --> 26:47.703
Is there something going on between the
two of you that I should know about?

26:47.808 --> 26:51.303
He's really good company.

26:53.305 --> 26:56.500
My wife is sure that
Hugh's coming back.

26:56.607 --> 26:58.901
What about you?

26:59.008 --> 27:00.301
I...

27:00.405 --> 27:02.903
wish I...

27:04.206 --> 27:06.203
I wish I could be so sure.

27:06.306 --> 27:09.100
The doctors, they all say he's gone.
He's been brain dead for months.

27:09.207 --> 27:12.802
They say there's no chance,
there's no...

27:12.906 --> 27:17.001
chance my son's going to come back.

27:17.807 --> 27:19.701
But Jenna doesn't want
to hear anything.

27:19.807 --> 27:22.902
You know, that's still her son
in there, and he's still breathing.

27:23.008 --> 27:25.501
I just...

27:25.905 --> 27:28.800
I just wish I knew if
I was doing the right thing.

27:28.906 --> 27:30.001
What about his wife?

27:30.107 --> 27:32.802
She just wants the money.

27:32.907 --> 27:34.700
That's why she married him.

27:34.808 --> 27:36.701
She knew damn well how sick he was.

27:36.807 --> 27:38.101
She was waiting tables.

27:38.207 --> 27:42.301
She didn't even go to college.
She doesn't love him the way we do.

27:42.406 --> 27:45.303
But I don't want to keep Hugh alive
just to spite her.

27:45.407 --> 27:48.403
Would you mind...

27:49.206 --> 27:53.503
Can I sit with him
just a few minutes?

27:55.006 --> 27:56.601
No, I don't mind.

27:56.708 --> 27:57.703
Sure.

27:57.806 --> 28:00.901
Keep an eye on Bob.

28:12.008 --> 28:15.700
- Do you want them to end this?
- I'm not meant to be here.

28:15.807 --> 28:17.500
They're keeping me here.

28:17.608 --> 28:19.501
Are you suffering?

28:19.608 --> 28:21.700
I feel like a prisoner.

28:21.808 --> 28:28.600
Well, did you tell Lisa that you
didn't want to be kept alive
if something happened?

28:28.705 --> 28:30.403
Oh, my god.
She's got to know.

28:30.506 --> 28:31.500
Know what?

28:31.606 --> 28:34.000
She's got to know what she did.

28:34.107 --> 28:35.600
What did she do?

28:35.708 --> 28:37.800
I've got to talk to them.

28:37.905 --> 28:41.700
- Well, I don't know if I can...
- No, please. You're my only chance.

28:41.806 --> 28:43.300
I know, but...

28:43.408 --> 28:44.402
is it really your business?

28:44.508 --> 28:47.000
I mean, maybe you need to step
away from this one and just...

28:47.105 --> 28:49.901
you know, just let it play out
between the families.

28:50.005 --> 28:51.500
They have rights.

28:51.608 --> 28:55.500
It's not up to us to step in
between and tell them what to do.

28:55.605 --> 28:57.400
Us?

28:57.508 --> 28:59.702
All right, you.

28:59.805 --> 29:02.003
I'm not telling them what to do.

29:02.108 --> 29:03.202
It's...

29:03.307 --> 29:05.700
I'm supposed to help the dead
with their unfinished business.

29:05.808 --> 29:07.700
Yeah, but nobody's dead here.
Now, what's the problem?

29:07.807 --> 29:10.602
No, but his spirit still came to me,
and he asked me for help.

29:10.707 --> 29:12.101
I mean, that's what this
whole thing should be about,

29:12.207 --> 29:14.200
not what his wife wants,
not what his parents want.

29:14.308 --> 29:15.903
It should be what Hugh wants.

29:16.006 --> 29:18.402
He's the one who's laying there,
wasting away.

29:18.506 --> 29:20.602
You're absolutely sure
this is what he wants?

29:20.706 --> 29:23.201
Yeah. I have no doubts.

29:23.305 --> 29:26.201
Wouldn't you want the same thing?

29:26.308 --> 29:28.200
Wait a minute.

29:28.305 --> 29:30.402
Would you?

29:30.505 --> 29:32.600
If I didn't think
I would ever recover?

29:32.707 --> 29:35.702
Yeah. Absolutely.

29:38.806 --> 29:40.003
But...

29:40.108 --> 29:42.402
Can you ever really be sure?

29:42.507 --> 29:43.800
Of course not.

29:43.908 --> 29:45.502
No more sure than you can be
of what will happen

29:45.608 --> 29:48.002
when you walk out our
front door tomorrow morning.

29:48.105 --> 29:50.303
The only thing you can do is
take all the information you have

29:50.405 --> 29:53.002
and give it your best shot.

29:53.106 --> 29:55.403
I know that my best shot
is in the light,

29:55.505 --> 30:00.200
not with machines or tubes
or a hospital bed.

30:01.106 --> 30:03.202
You have insider information.
It's not fair.

30:03.305 --> 30:04.602
So do you.

30:04.708 --> 30:06.803
Yeah, I know.

30:06.905 --> 30:10.203
It's just, you know...

30:11.205 --> 30:13.301
if it came to you,

30:13.407 --> 30:15.602
it wouldn't be easy for me,
that's all.

30:15.706 --> 30:18.601
Yeah, but you'd do it
because you love me.

30:18.705 --> 30:20.902
And you know I'd be ok.

30:21.007 --> 30:23.803
Yeah. I would.

30:25.407 --> 30:27.903
And you?

30:29.307 --> 30:30.903
If you're still here,
hook me up.

30:31.006 --> 30:32.503
I'll take the machines.

30:32.608 --> 30:35.800
I'll take a beating heart,
if nothing else, just in case.

30:35.905 --> 30:38.103
But if you go before me,

30:38.206 --> 30:42.303
don't even bother plugging them in.

30:47.007 --> 30:50.503
I don't want to interfere
in these people's lives.

30:50.608 --> 30:53.802
And I don't want to get
between them. But...

30:53.907 --> 30:58.902
Hugh Bristow doesn't have anybody
else to speak for him but me.

30:59.008 --> 31:01.602
So I will.

31:01.907 --> 31:04.701
So you should.

31:06.705 --> 31:08.301
Don't let them do this!

31:08.406 --> 31:09.102
Do what?

31:09.208 --> 31:10.402
They're going to bring me back.

31:10.508 --> 31:15.702
Please, I'm gone already!
Just tell them to let me go!

31:19.808 --> 31:22.903
What just happened?

31:23.805 --> 31:26.701
I think Hugh just died.

31:26.807 --> 31:30.402
And they brought him back.

31:49.305 --> 31:51.603
You got brass ones,
I'll give you that,

31:51.708 --> 31:54.500
to come here after last time.

31:54.608 --> 31:55.900
Just what is it you want?

31:56.006 --> 31:58.502
I came here because
I need you to trust me.

31:58.605 --> 31:59.903
Why?

32:00.008 --> 32:03.602
Because I'm going to ask you
to do something that isn't so easy.

32:03.708 --> 32:05.700
Why do you care about any of this?

32:05.807 --> 32:07.700
I'm just trying to help.

32:07.808 --> 32:10.802
Do you believe the things
they say about me in the papers?

32:10.907 --> 32:13.402
Should I?

32:14.007 --> 32:18.003
Hugh and I met 2 years ago in a diner.

32:18.107 --> 32:20.502
I was his waitress.

32:20.607 --> 32:23.403
The papers love to play that up.

32:23.507 --> 32:27.503
For me it was love at first sight.

32:28.505 --> 32:33.200
As we got more serious,
Hugh told me he had A.L.S..

32:33.305 --> 32:36.301
A death sentence.

32:39.306 --> 32:44.703
Whatever time he had left,
I wanted to share it with him.

32:49.805 --> 32:54.300
He wanted to get married, but he didn't
want to saddle me with his illness.

32:54.406 --> 32:59.600
I loved him so much
nothing could have scared me away.

33:00.106 --> 33:03.801
The wedding was so beautiful.

33:04.106 --> 33:06.203
Not even his parents could ruin it.

33:06.308 --> 33:09.102
And don't think they didn't try.

33:09.205 --> 33:12.802
They were sure I was only after his money.

33:12.905 --> 33:15.100
His disease progressed more
quickly than we expected,

33:15.206 --> 33:19.501
so we went to a clinic in Switzerland.

33:19.806 --> 33:21.701
Then he went into the coma.

33:21.808 --> 33:24.101
Not the usual thing
that happens with A.L.S..

33:24.207 --> 33:27.403
So that's my side of it.
Is that what you came here for?

33:27.506 --> 33:28.402
No.

33:28.506 --> 33:29.803
I didn't think so.

33:29.905 --> 33:31.903
Well, whatever it is you're up to,

33:32.006 --> 33:34.102
I hope you don't think
that you can hurt me.

33:34.207 --> 33:36.702
Not any more than
they've hurt me already.

33:36.807 --> 33:41.101
'Cause I'm pretty much
bulletproof now.

33:43.205 --> 33:48.002
I came here because
I have a message from Hugh.

33:48.508 --> 33:50.800
When did Hugh give you a message?

33:50.908 --> 33:52.801
It's complicated,

33:52.907 --> 33:56.700
but I need to tell you at the hospital
with Bill and Janet, all of you together.

33:56.805 --> 33:58.602
No way. Uh...

33:58.707 --> 34:00.001
I mean, even if I wanted to,
they would never...

34:00.107 --> 34:03.202
It's something you're going to
want to hear.

34:03.305 --> 34:07.302
Something everyone needs to hear.

34:07.708 --> 34:12.199
You're going to be ok.
We're going to bring you through this.

34:12.308 --> 34:15.201
But you have to keep fighting, Hugh.

34:15.306 --> 34:18.699
You have to stay strong.

34:22.606 --> 34:24.003
You've got to be kidding.

34:24.105 --> 34:26.402
It's not your turn.
We have another hour.

34:26.507 --> 34:30.103
- Why did you bring her here?
- I just want you all to listen.

34:30.205 --> 34:32.002
Ok? Just listen.

34:32.107 --> 34:34.402
I have a message from Hugh.

34:34.507 --> 34:35.802
What are you talking about?

34:35.908 --> 34:37.900
His spirit is here with us right now.

34:38.005 --> 34:40.001
What is this?

34:40.108 --> 34:43.501
- What are you trying to pull?
- I'm not trying to pull anything,

34:43.605 --> 34:45.300
and I'm not going to waste time
on explanations.

34:45.408 --> 34:47.902
There are some things
that he wants you all to know.

34:48.005 --> 34:52.800
I feel so much stronger
just being close to him.

34:52.906 --> 34:55.603
Tell him I liked it
when he read to me.

34:55.706 --> 34:57.903
I just liked hearing his voice.

34:58.008 --> 35:01.701
He wants you to know
that he liked it when you read to him.

35:01.808 --> 35:05.100
It meant a lot to hear your voice,
especially when you read Hemingway.

35:05.208 --> 35:07.001
Ok, that's enough.

35:07.106 --> 35:09.303
You can't do this to us.

35:09.405 --> 35:13.100
What is wrong with you? Do you
not think we have suffered enough?

35:13.205 --> 35:15.800
- Tell her I know what happened.
- He knows what happened.

35:15.905 --> 35:17.002
And tell her it's all right.

35:17.105 --> 35:21.902
- He's saying it's all right.
- What? What happened?

35:22.005 --> 35:26.300
He's saying something about medication.
Did you give him pills?

35:26.405 --> 35:30.403
No. This is some kind of a trick.

35:31.007 --> 35:34.502
He's saying that it's all right
and he forgives you, and so will they.

35:34.606 --> 35:37.603
I took care of my son.

35:37.705 --> 35:41.703
I know how to take care of my son.

35:45.007 --> 35:49.203
I was afraid that she had done
something to him in Switzerland.

35:49.305 --> 35:52.801
Hugh went into a seizure.

35:54.005 --> 35:57.703
So I gave him some muscle relaxants.

35:57.807 --> 35:58.902
Which ones?

35:59.007 --> 36:02.002
The ones I always gave him
when he seized.

36:02.105 --> 36:03.803
The doctors took him off those.

36:03.907 --> 36:07.700
They said they would interact
with his antidepressants.

36:07.807 --> 36:10.300
How could you give them to him
without telling me?

36:10.407 --> 36:12.603
He seized and I...

36:12.705 --> 36:15.200
I had to do something.

36:15.307 --> 36:17.102
That was when he went into the coma.

36:17.207 --> 36:20.800
Wait. He doesn't want to blame anyone.
He just wants you all to stop this.

36:20.908 --> 36:22.803
Bill, this is all my fault.

36:22.907 --> 36:25.602
She's right.

36:25.705 --> 36:27.302
Look what I've done...
I've killed him!

36:27.406 --> 36:29.602
He's saying none of this matters now.

36:29.705 --> 36:34.601
He just wants you all to stop
hating each other and let him go.

36:34.705 --> 36:36.900
But if this is true,

36:37.005 --> 36:39.603
if he really is here,

36:39.705 --> 36:41.300
then he's aware...

36:41.408 --> 36:45.602
aware of what's going on.
How can we end his life?

36:45.708 --> 36:47.500
I am aware, mom.

36:47.605 --> 36:49.903
I'm aware that I'm not coming back.

36:50.007 --> 36:53.803
And I will continue to be trapped here
until these machines stop living for me.

36:53.905 --> 36:55.801
He is aware.

36:55.908 --> 36:58.801
He can see you and he can feel you,

36:58.905 --> 37:00.503
but he knows that it's his time to go,

37:00.608 --> 37:02.601
and he's not living.

37:02.705 --> 37:04.403
These machines are doing it for him.

37:04.508 --> 37:07.101
He's my son.

37:07.208 --> 37:09.400
No.

37:10.005 --> 37:12.500
I can't let him go.

37:12.608 --> 37:14.800
Mom, you want me to stay here for you,

37:14.905 --> 37:16.402
not for me.

37:16.507 --> 37:20.000
He says that he thinks you're
wanting him to stay for your sake,

37:20.106 --> 37:22.103
not for him.

37:22.207 --> 37:27.900
And keeping him here,
it's only making it harder on everyone.

37:28.906 --> 37:30.901
Mom...

37:31.006 --> 37:34.102
I need you to heal.

37:36.408 --> 37:38.000
I want you to love Lisa.

37:38.107 --> 37:39.900
She's all alone now.

37:40.005 --> 37:42.403
She needs you.

37:42.508 --> 37:45.502
What's happening?

37:46.207 --> 37:49.801
Tell Lisa I know that she loved me.

37:49.908 --> 37:52.703
I knew it was for real.

37:52.808 --> 37:55.802
I felt her tears on my shoulders

37:55.905 --> 37:57.703
and on my back.

37:57.808 --> 38:01.200
She didn't want me
to see her crying.

38:01.308 --> 38:05.902
Tell her I know how hard
she fought for me.

38:09.605 --> 38:12.001
He knows how much you loved him.

38:12.108 --> 38:17.501
He was talking about the night
that he felt your tears...

40:06.208 --> 40:08.000
- Jim?
- Shower.

40:08.105 --> 40:12.303
Ooh. That's a good idea.
Is there room for me?

40:12.408 --> 40:16.103
It can be arranged, I think.

40:20.406 --> 40:21.603
Is it raining where you are?

40:21.706 --> 40:23.801
Oh, professor Payne.

40:23.908 --> 40:25.502
No, it's a shower.

40:25.605 --> 40:27.700
You know what?
That's a lite too much information.

40:27.805 --> 40:30.200
Uh, actually,
it's not enough information.

40:30.307 --> 40:31.703
Well, that's all you're getting.

40:31.807 --> 40:33.803
You're cruel, but you knew that,
didn't you?

40:33.907 --> 40:37.102
No, cruel would be if I run out of
hot water. What can I do for you?

40:37.206 --> 40:41.901
I know you may find this difficult to
believe, but I may have made an error.

40:42.008 --> 40:44.603
I find it shocking
that you're admitting it.

40:44.706 --> 40:46.100
What's your error?

40:46.205 --> 40:50.000
That latin translation I gave you.
It seems my linguistics are a bit rusty.

40:50.108 --> 40:52.501
Oh. Well, no worries.
It's all taken care of.

40:52.606 --> 40:54.003
Game over for now.

40:54.105 --> 40:57.002
- I wouldn't be so sure about that.
- What do you mean?

40:57.108 --> 40:59.303
The phrase "mors dilecti"

40:59.407 --> 41:04.102
it does not mean "body of the crime"
after all.

41:04.205 --> 41:05.402
So what does it mean?

41:05.505 --> 41:07.303
It means...

41:07.407 --> 41:09.202
it means something entirely
different, Melinda.

41:09.307 --> 41:11.003
What?

41:11.105 --> 41:13.101
What does it mean?

41:13.208 --> 41:17.103
It means "death of a loved one."

41:26.508 --> 41:30.001
Honey, you coming or not?
