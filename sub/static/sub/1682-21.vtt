WEBVTT

00:01.420 --> 00:04.471
Kids, your aunt Robin had only
been dating Don a short while,

00:04.718 --> 00:06.538
But one evening, out of nowhere...

00:06.658 --> 00:08.414
- Robin? - Mm?
- Do you wanna move in?

00:09.777 --> 00:12.054
Well, um it it... it's...

00:12.115 --> 00:13.779
Kind of soon, but...

00:14.536 --> 00:16.113
Sure, I would consider...

00:16.470 --> 00:18.292
moving in here, just let me think about it.

00:19.015 --> 00:21.611
No, I meant do you want to move in
on the couch so I can sit down.

00:22.673 --> 00:25.106
Yeah, that's what I meant too,

00:25.352 --> 00:28.149
- Like I said, just let me think about it.
- Ok.

00:31.747 --> 00:33.578
- Yeah, I'm OK with that.
- Okay.

00:36.421 --> 00:38.963
But, now that you mentioned it...

00:40.114 --> 00:41.414
Do you wanna move in?

00:42.355 --> 00:43.750
So what did you say?

00:44.191 --> 00:47.004
- I'm considering it.
- You're considering it?

00:47.124 --> 00:48.521
- Yeah.
- You barely know him.

00:48.781 --> 00:51.190
Plus the guy is a loser
with a dead end job.

00:51.228 --> 00:54.946
- We have the same job, Barney.
- And we couldn't be prouder of you, angel.

00:56.226 --> 00:58.738
- Oh, sweetie, this does seem kind of fast.
- I know.

00:58.782 --> 01:01.063
- Well, maybe you're right.
- Well, I think you should move in with him.

01:01.296 --> 01:02.281
- You do?
- Yeah.

01:02.600 --> 01:03.388
Yeah, I mean I...

01:03.694 --> 01:06.089
I see how happy you are and
as much as I love you as roommate,

01:06.408 --> 01:08.048
I want you to do what's right for you.

01:09.661 --> 01:12.046
Are you trying to kick me out
because of the milk thing?

01:12.090 --> 01:13.118
It's really annoying.

01:18.032 --> 01:19.317
Robin?

01:21.000 --> 01:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:31.464 --> 01:32.407
No...

01:32.527 --> 01:37.482
I have a system. I put the empty carton
back in the fridge to remind us to buy milk.

01:37.602 --> 01:41.272
Ok, why don't you leave a full carton
to remind us we don't have to buy milk?

01:41.392 --> 01:42.661
Alright, alright.

01:43.311 --> 01:44.440
As your ex...

01:44.486 --> 01:46.410
Before you jump in to anything,

01:46.611 --> 01:47.690
I need to meet this guy.

01:47.762 --> 01:50.059
I think it's kind of weird
I haven't met him yet.

01:50.179 --> 01:54.173
Totally weird, it's almost like someone
carefully orchestrated that way on purpose.

01:56.100 --> 01:59.654
Fine, but you have to promise to be
on your best behavior.

01:59.689 --> 02:01.144
I promise.

02:01.264 --> 02:03.854
So I'm banging this Portuguese
contortionist...

02:03.910 --> 02:05.008
And I swear...

02:05.128 --> 02:09.431
She is so flexible, at one point she was
on top of me and underneath me

02:09.473 --> 02:11.060
On top and down low!

02:13.862 --> 02:15.858
- Who needs? Who needs?
- I'm good.

02:16.110 --> 02:19.049
- And that would be Barney,
- He means well.

02:19.328 --> 02:20.654
Well actually, I'm not sure that's true.

02:20.774 --> 02:22.062
Well, I think he's awesome.

02:22.527 --> 02:26.521
But I'd feel bad for any woman with a kinda low
self esteem to actually date a guy like that.

02:27.714 --> 02:31.335
And that's when I realized Robin
never told Don she had dated Barney.

02:32.019 --> 02:33.266
I like you, Don.

02:33.704 --> 02:37.189
We both love a good scotch, we
both enjoy my compelling stories

02:37.309 --> 02:38.836
And we both dated Robin.

02:39.533 --> 02:40.858
Now he knew.

02:41.191 --> 02:51.644

<font color="#EC14BD">www.addic7ed.com</font>

02:57.136 --> 02:59.153
So Barney's your ex and
you still hang out with him?

02:59.673 --> 03:01.261
I gotta say I'm a little
uncomfortable with that.

03:01.308 --> 03:04.074
Oh, don't be, it's like we never dated.

03:04.522 --> 03:07.292
Long story short, this exchange students arms gave out

03:07.331 --> 03:09.165
And we both fell *** over sex swing.

03:09.895 --> 03:13.433
Seriously, I have never been able to find
a girl who can do that position since Robin.

03:14.799 --> 03:19.241
Hey, Lily, Marshall, how was your
weekend away or any other topic?

03:19.361 --> 03:21.045
- Awful.
- Terrible.

03:21.396 --> 03:25.332
Twin beds? I can't sleep in separate beds.

03:25.600 --> 03:27.068
We should go complain.

03:27.328 --> 03:30.664
Yeah, you're right, I'm gonna march
down there and demand another room.

03:30.784 --> 03:32.441
Yeah, I'll go with you and...

03:32.741 --> 03:34.872
Just a sec...

03:37.729 --> 03:39.123
House keeping!

03:40.599 --> 03:43.297
Could you come back a little later?
We're taking a little cat nap.

03:43.688 --> 03:44.990
It's time to check out.

03:48.455 --> 03:49.990
We slept for 18 hours.

03:50.018 --> 03:53.119
- We missed 3 prepaid meals.
- I lost 11 pounds.

03:53.833 --> 03:56.676
Hey, Ted, you think it's weird that
Robin is still friends with Barney?

03:56.945 --> 03:58.995
I think it's weird that we're all
still friends with Barney.

03:59.323 --> 04:02.520
I just don't know how to feel about her
hanging out with one of her exes all the time.

04:02.794 --> 04:07.212
And that's when I realized Robin had failed
to tell Don about another one of her exes.

04:07.446 --> 04:08.369
Me.

04:09.085 --> 04:13.292
No, hanging out with one ex
is fine, even 2 I'd give a pass.

04:13.339 --> 04:15.592
Hell, 2 might be even better than one.

04:16.591 --> 04:17.822
For some reason.

04:18.123 --> 04:20.637
Yeah, but if you were dating someone
and he hung out with one of his exes...

04:20.665 --> 04:21.478
Wait, I'm sorry.

04:22.155 --> 04:24.697
- He?
- Yeah, he was friends with one of his exes.

04:24.734 --> 04:26.432
Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

04:26.693 --> 04:29.624
- Do you think I'm gay?
- Well...

04:30.110 --> 04:33.172
- Yeah.
- Why would you assume that?

04:34.368 --> 04:37.361
- Hey.
- Hey, your calligraphy teacher called...

04:37.481 --> 04:39.658
- And?
- And your ink is in.

04:39.778 --> 04:40.679
Yes.

04:42.702 --> 04:46.460
Hey, guys, just wanna make sure
Project Runway is recording.

04:47.571 --> 04:49.491
Did the Jets get new costumes?

04:51.060 --> 04:54.230
Well, I guess we won't be having
creme brulee tonight,

04:54.302 --> 04:56.586
My browning torch is broken.

04:59.272 --> 05:02.046
You know, when I heard your roommate was
a single guy, I was a little jealous,

05:02.100 --> 05:03.542
But now that I know that he's gay...

05:03.662 --> 05:05.950
- I'm OK.
- Oh, but Ted's not....

05:05.986 --> 05:07.767
But we still got home made lady fingers

05:07.795 --> 05:09.551
And piping hot dog chilling(?)

05:09.671 --> 05:10.586
Thank you.

05:12.076 --> 05:15.111
- Ted's not what?
- Ted's not gonna be around a lot.

05:15.231 --> 05:17.448
He's following Cher on tour.

05:18.890 --> 05:21.842
Hey, don't get me wrong, Cher puts on
a hell of a show.

05:21.962 --> 05:23.243
But I am not gay.

05:24.001 --> 05:25.703
Hey, Lily, be honest.

05:25.736 --> 05:28.455
Is it weird that Robin hangs out
with one of her exes all the time?

05:28.500 --> 05:31.476
Well Ted and Robin broke up years ago.
It's a non issue.

05:31.596 --> 05:32.872
- Ted?
- And Robin?

05:32.992 --> 05:35.620
Not seeming so gay now, am I, Donnie?

05:35.671 --> 05:37.827
- An Appletini for the gentleman.
- Thank you.

05:38.792 --> 05:40.180
You dated Ted, too?

05:41.054 --> 05:43.214
Robin, of the four people you consider
your best friends in New York,

05:43.269 --> 05:45.506
- you've slept with 50 percent of them.
- Don...

05:45.626 --> 05:46.778
They're just my friends.

05:46.817 --> 05:48.254
Yes, but they're also your exes.

05:48.539 --> 05:49.682
And you live with one of them.

05:50.846 --> 05:53.538
Look, I'm sorry. I gotta, I gotta think
about all this,

06:00.363 --> 06:01.486
My God!

06:01.606 --> 06:03.602
She's 1000 degrees.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.213
It's like putting my leg against
a tail pipe.

06:09.885 --> 06:10.897
Ow!

06:11.017 --> 06:13.015
He's toe nails are like daggers.

06:17.018 --> 06:18.426
I'd love a sandwich.

06:18.785 --> 06:20.462
But no eating in bed.

06:20.982 --> 06:22.437
Stupid rule!

06:22.724 --> 06:24.337
We have ants one time...

06:28.109 --> 06:30.607
Great! And now he's falling asleep.

06:30.727 --> 06:32.811
Cue the river of drool.

06:36.439 --> 06:38.120
My knee itches.

06:38.526 --> 06:41.264
Just one little scratch.

06:44.907 --> 06:46.758
Marshall!

06:48.092 --> 06:51.506
- You think we should get separate beds?
- Yes, a mini fridge.

06:51.752 --> 06:53.091
And separate beds.

06:53.211 --> 06:54.140
Deal!

06:55.643 --> 06:57.365
- Don!
- Hi.

06:57.485 --> 06:59.396
I came to apologize to all of you.

06:59.516 --> 07:00.940
I overreacted.

07:01.060 --> 07:03.612
Well, we.. Owe you an apology too, Don.

07:03.633 --> 07:05.679
We've said some pretty hurtful things.

07:05.799 --> 07:08.267
- No, you didn't.
- Right, that was after you left.

07:09.356 --> 07:12.131
I'm sorry I didn't tell you the truth
in the first place.

07:12.179 --> 07:15.076
No, I acted like a total drama queen.
That's not offensive, right?

07:15.196 --> 07:16.237
Still not gay.

07:16.357 --> 07:20.045
Sorry. The point is you both are clearly
very important to Robin

07:20.101 --> 07:22.334
So why don't we all have dinner
tomorrow night at my place?

07:22.454 --> 07:25.861
- Oh, that's great.
- Looking forward to it, buddy.

07:26.228 --> 07:27.645
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

07:28.910 --> 07:31.438
- Should we go?
- Yeah, see you guys! - Bye.

07:33.065 --> 07:34.609
- Ted.
- Yeah.

07:35.834 --> 07:37.385
I must have Robin back.

07:43.102 --> 07:44.866
- You're kidding, right?
- No.

07:45.234 --> 07:48.296
I don't know what it is,
but I want Robin back.

07:48.416 --> 07:50.606
I know what it is... You're like...

07:50.726 --> 07:52.813
a little kid who throws a toy away

07:52.860 --> 07:55.299
And then wants it back the second
another kid starts playing with it.

07:55.323 --> 07:56.951
Well maybe I wasn't done playing with it.

07:57.378 --> 08:00.517
Maybe I just set it down cause I wanted
to play with another stuff for a second.

08:00.965 --> 08:03.421
Okay. You're ready.

08:03.997 --> 08:05.150
Ready for what?

08:05.571 --> 08:06.924
To read the letter.

08:07.279 --> 08:08.236
Kids...

08:08.294 --> 08:10.020
The letter was a device I'd invented

08:10.047 --> 08:12.418
To remind myself why I'd broken up
with somebody.

08:12.796 --> 08:14.117
I've been doing it for years.

08:14.800 --> 08:15.962
Dear future Ted,

08:16.659 --> 08:20.126
Never get back with Karen
because she's a pretentious snob.

08:20.602 --> 08:22.693
Oh, also she cheated on you.

08:23.195 --> 08:24.971
I'm sorry you had to find out this way.

08:27.142 --> 08:29.291
See? We're already laughing about it.

08:30.498 --> 08:32.070
Dear future Ted,

08:32.190 --> 08:33.998
Stay away from Natalie.

08:34.337 --> 08:36.032
Or any girl who can pin you to the ground

08:36.054 --> 08:38.200
and beat you senseless
in front of a cheering crowd.

08:39.054 --> 08:40.325
P.S.

08:40.791 --> 08:44.494
Please consult a therapist about
why that turned you on a little bit.

08:46.305 --> 08:48.897
Dear relationship genius

08:49.608 --> 08:51.453
Stella left you at the altar,

08:52.136 --> 08:53.721
You may never love again.

08:54.607 --> 08:56.342
And you'll probably die alone.

08:58.953 --> 08:59.814
Huh.

09:00.566 --> 09:02.725
It doesn't look so sad written
in calligraphy.

09:04.350 --> 09:07.083
So when Barney and Robin broke up
the previous fall...

09:07.109 --> 09:08.903
Dating Robin was a huge mistake.

09:09.183 --> 09:09.961
Write that down.

09:10.567 --> 09:10.990
What?

09:11.110 --> 09:12.690
Write yourself a letter.

09:12.734 --> 09:14.662
That way, when you miss Robin,

09:14.683 --> 09:17.259
And you will, you can remind yourself
why you broke up.

09:17.379 --> 09:18.571
- Gladly.
- Mhm.

09:19.323 --> 09:23.108
- Dear... future... Barney...
- Uuh.

09:23.901 --> 09:25.363
This ink is cool.

09:25.483 --> 09:26.989
Right? Right?

09:27.109 --> 09:28.561
You....

09:28.916 --> 09:31.245
and Robin were a terrible couple.

09:31.773 --> 09:33.237
You just didn't work.

09:33.550 --> 09:35.272
Sure, you'll always love Robin,

09:35.295 --> 09:36.653
But remember other women...

09:36.773 --> 09:38.174
More importantly...

09:38.294 --> 09:39.965
remember other boobs,

09:40.696 --> 09:43.252
and all that cool stuff
you can do with boobs...

09:43.866 --> 09:47.648
Nozzle, juggle, honka, honka...

09:48.243 --> 09:50.782
I guess I'm just a hopeless romantic.

09:52.421 --> 09:55.141
And there's just a bunch of drawings
of boobs.

09:55.970 --> 09:58.465
- You get it now?
- Yeah, I get it.

09:59.627 --> 10:01.294
I definitely want her back.

10:03.778 --> 10:06.624
I don't think human beings were ever
meant to sleep in the same bed.

10:06.744 --> 10:10.422
Somehow sex and sleep got jumbled together
but they're two different things.

10:10.449 --> 10:11.397
I know.

10:11.517 --> 10:13.687
I mean I love you, but I want this new bed

10:13.704 --> 10:16.956
To be a sanctuary for sleep and sleep alone.

10:17.076 --> 10:20.100
Me too. And some light snacking
but that's it.

10:21.273 --> 10:22.557
Hey, you know what we should get?

10:23.118 --> 10:25.441
We should get a third bed, just for sex.

10:26.261 --> 10:27.915
Oh, yes, a sex bed...

10:27.982 --> 10:29.583
A dirty, dirty, sex bed.

10:29.703 --> 10:32.385
Genius. That way each bed will have a specific purpose.

10:32.427 --> 10:35.955
Exactly. We'll have 2 sleep beds,
a sex bed,

10:36.229 --> 10:39.167
And I'm thinking a bean bag chair
just for special birthday stuff.

10:39.775 --> 10:40.744
Baby...

10:41.005 --> 10:44.012
- Can we just revolutionize modern marriage?
- Damn straight.

10:48.622 --> 10:50.330
- Hey!
- Hey!

10:50.576 --> 10:53.364
Hey, guys. hey, Don.
I hope you like sushi.

10:53.425 --> 10:57.484
How cool is that Don makes do sushi?
He learned while on assignment in Japan.

10:57.604 --> 10:59.892
Mmm. Ring wormalicious.

11:00.147 --> 11:03.399
Barney, be nice. You only want her
because you can't have her.

11:03.447 --> 11:06.328
It's like if I said "You can sit
anywhere in this room except...

11:06.392 --> 11:07.338
that chair."

11:07.371 --> 11:09.359
- Are you so petty that...
- My chair! My chair!

11:10.360 --> 11:13.599
Oh, spicy tuna with halopania (?)?
My favorite.

11:13.666 --> 11:14.951
Mine too. I love spicy food.

11:15.071 --> 11:17.350
- The hotter, the better.
- I love spicy stuff too, guy.

11:17.470 --> 11:18.631
Probably more than you do.

11:19.055 --> 11:20.080
Suck it.

11:21.625 --> 11:22.691
Mmm.

11:22.932 --> 11:24.668
Super... hot.

11:26.076 --> 11:27.442
I'm not feeling good.

11:28.980 --> 11:29.828
Hey, Lily.

11:30.071 --> 11:33.461
You won't believe it. It's the craziest
thing. Don has twin beds too,

11:33.581 --> 11:35.651
Oh my God! We just got twin beds.

11:35.771 --> 11:37.766
Oh, oh. Great. Great.

11:38.281 --> 11:40.686
Oh, wait. That "great" didn't
sound so great.

11:40.946 --> 11:42.832
Well my ex wife and I thought
it would be a good idea

11:42.878 --> 11:44.311
But we just started to drift apart.

11:46.027 --> 11:48.842
Yeah, but I bet you didn't have
another bed just for sex.

11:49.221 --> 11:51.462
No, but she did, at her
personal trainer's house.

11:52.364 --> 11:54.756
This chili is like an ice cube
in my mouth.

11:55.957 --> 11:57.077
I will say this, though...

11:57.197 --> 11:59.784
I'm gonna get a king size bed if Robin
decides to move in.

11:59.904 --> 12:02.084
Oh, I'd like that.

12:02.204 --> 12:04.951
- If I move in.
- If you move in.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.259
Hey, hey, hey, Tokyo Don...

12:07.455 --> 12:08.232
You ever...

12:08.411 --> 12:09.749
Do this back in Japan?

12:09.788 --> 12:11.193
- Wasabi!
- Barney, don't!

12:11.238 --> 12:13.043
- Oh, my God, Barney!
- Aaah!

12:13.521 --> 12:15.435
- Awesome!
- Give him some milk.

12:15.555 --> 12:19.487
- Spit it out, spit it out!
- Oh, we're out of milk.

12:19.774 --> 12:21.729
But thanks for the reminder, Robin.

12:24.360 --> 12:25.371
Oh, you're sweet...

12:25.491 --> 12:27.531
Well, I hope you're happy.

12:27.791 --> 12:29.641
Hey, I stand by what I did.

12:29.761 --> 12:31.882
It was bold and romantic.

12:32.241 --> 12:34.370
You soiled yourself from
both ends of your body.

12:34.742 --> 12:39.230
Oh, come on. You have done
tons of stupid stuff to impress Robin.

12:39.257 --> 12:42.489
Yeah, I did, but I don't anymore,
cause I'm over her.

12:42.530 --> 12:45.056
- Just like you are.
- You are not over her.

12:45.100 --> 12:48.077
You want her back just as much as I do,
you just won't let yourself go there.

12:48.113 --> 12:51.542
That is ridiculous and I'll tell you why.

12:53.804 --> 12:55.730
For my biographer?

12:55.850 --> 12:59.243
Just, just focus on the letter, okay?

13:00.345 --> 13:03.207
Dear Ted, Robin is
the perfect girl for you

13:03.327 --> 13:05.344
but she doesn't want
to be in a serious relationship.

13:05.464 --> 13:07.227
You need someone who wants to settle down.

13:07.467 --> 13:09.387
So until Robin is ready
for that next step,

13:09.813 --> 13:11.122
she's not your girl.

13:13.394 --> 13:16.445
Still, I'll always remember stealing her
the blue French horn,

13:17.470 --> 13:20.546
our first kiss, the look in her eye when she told me

13:21.700 --> 13:22.890
she loved me.

13:25.050 --> 13:28.125
Dammit. Now I want her back.

13:33.649 --> 13:37.913
So that night your uncle Barney and I
sat down to have a calm, rational discussion

13:37.940 --> 13:39.746
about who deserved Robin more.

13:39.804 --> 13:42.531
- No!
- I stole her a blue French horn...

13:42.571 --> 13:43.820
dated her for a year.

13:43.837 --> 13:46.295
I wanted her to be the mother
of my children

13:46.330 --> 13:47.691
and spend eternity in her arms.

13:47.724 --> 13:49.449
She... I....

13:49.510 --> 13:52.738
want to have sex with her
at least one more time.

13:52.793 --> 13:55.722
- She is mine.
- She's not yours.

13:55.842 --> 13:58.180
And she is not mine either. She's...

13:58.300 --> 14:00.654
- Don's.
- Right.

14:01.214 --> 14:03.207
- We gotta get rid of that guy.
- Yeah.

14:03.972 --> 14:06.651
- Yeah.
- You know, figuratively.

14:07.323 --> 14:10.644
- Of course.
- Or literally.

14:13.572 --> 14:15.622
Oh my God, Ted, this is how it starts.

14:15.742 --> 14:19.372
This is how it starts. I'm scared, Teddy,
I'm scared, Teddy.

14:19.492 --> 14:22.682
- Two guys talking, two guys talking.
- Okay.

14:22.802 --> 14:24.104
Okay.

14:24.224 --> 14:26.709
- Marshall, I'm worried.
- Why?

14:26.829 --> 14:28.772
I don't wanna get divorced.

14:28.892 --> 14:30.194
Oh, baby...

14:31.000 --> 14:31.936
Baby...

14:32.287 --> 14:34.925
That's Don. That's not us.

14:35.308 --> 14:38.055
Our new sleeping arrangement is only
gonna bring us closer together.

14:39.249 --> 14:40.567
Now get out of my bed.

14:42.352 --> 14:45.102
- Can we at least push them together?
- Sure.

14:45.222 --> 14:48.599
- Okay. - Oh, you meant the beds.
I don't wanna do that.

14:48.719 --> 14:50.540
- Why not?
- Baby...

14:50.660 --> 14:52.618
I love you more than life itself.

14:52.674 --> 14:54.356
But you're a million degrees.

14:54.476 --> 14:57.336
Honestly, I'm surprised your hourly
pee breaks aren't just steam.

14:57.844 --> 14:59.784
Well, you're no picnic in bed either.

14:59.811 --> 15:02.065
Oh, except for the food and the ants. But...

15:02.447 --> 15:04.494
Well, I still want to be next to you.

15:04.557 --> 15:07.323
Why? So you can kick me and slap me
all night?

15:07.553 --> 15:10.873
I swear to God, the second you fall asleep
is like you grow extra limbs.

15:10.947 --> 15:13.265
It's like spooning
with a Hindu Didi Ganesh.

15:17.865 --> 15:19.149
Wanna push them together?

15:19.198 --> 15:21.678
- We're still talking about the beds?
- Nope. - Get over here.

15:23.180 --> 15:25.824
- Robin Stinson.
- Robin Mosby.

15:25.851 --> 15:29.058
- Robin Stinson.
- Ted Scherbatzky. I'll take her name.

15:29.093 --> 15:30.997
- I don't care.
- Okay. Wait.

15:31.054 --> 15:33.536
How about this? How about this?
We share her.

15:33.946 --> 15:37.735
I'll take her until she's forty
and then you can have her after that.

15:39.165 --> 15:41.720
Who are we kidding, who are we kidding?
She's with Don now,

15:41.840 --> 15:43.224
We just have to accept that

15:43.497 --> 15:45.155
- and move on.
- You're right.

15:45.567 --> 15:47.501
I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to the bath...

15:47.537 --> 15:49.065
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

15:49.109 --> 15:50.453
And then I'll skip out...

15:56.008 --> 15:57.044
Hello?

15:57.164 --> 15:59.779
Hey, Robin, it's Barndoor.

15:59.841 --> 16:01.651
Guess what. I'm open.

16:01.894 --> 16:04.245
Hey, Barndoor. Hang on.
I'm getting another call.

16:05.228 --> 16:07.223
- Hello?
- Hey, Robin.

16:07.469 --> 16:10.572
Teddy bear. Need a little honey?

16:12.187 --> 16:14.866
- No. Ted, hang on.
- Okay.

16:15.290 --> 16:17.280
Hey, Barney, I...I'm gonna
have to call you back.

16:17.346 --> 16:20.311
Ted's on the other line and I...
I think he's in trouble.

16:20.431 --> 16:23.458
Ted's calling you?
Oh, he's in trouble alright.

16:25.139 --> 16:26.258
Ted, what's up?

16:26.378 --> 16:28.923
You've pretty hair. That's what's up.

16:29.155 --> 16:31.438
And down your back.

16:37.942 --> 16:41.192
Well, we almost let
that get out of control.

16:41.228 --> 16:42.649
Agreed.

16:42.881 --> 16:45.983
I'm gonna get out of here
before we do something we regret.

16:46.103 --> 16:47.541
Robin!

16:47.661 --> 16:49.441
Robin, I love you!

16:49.561 --> 16:51.975
- You son of a bitch.
- Robin!

16:52.095 --> 16:53.018
Robin!

16:53.376 --> 16:54.585
I brought you the blue French horn.

16:54.600 --> 16:56.581
I brought you the blue French horn, Robin!

16:56.601 --> 16:59.197
Ted is just holding it for me.
Sorry, buddy, I was there.

17:01.044 --> 17:03.504
Oh God, guys...What are you doing?

17:03.624 --> 17:05.060
Robin, I want you back!

17:06.646 --> 17:08.724
Hey, guys, why won't you come upstairs?

17:10.420 --> 17:11.478
Oh, hey!

17:12.352 --> 17:14.566
Alright! Don...

17:14.685 --> 17:15.824
Let's settle this!

17:15.891 --> 17:19.650
- You, me and Ted.
- Yeah, a 3-way.

17:21.031 --> 17:24.926
Look, guys, Robin and I have to do our show,
so why don't you have a sit on the couch...

17:24.964 --> 17:27.849
Watch some television and we'll talk
about this when we get back, okay?

17:28.102 --> 17:30.709
Oh, you gave up easy. game, set...

17:30.710 --> 17:31.693
Match!

17:31.754 --> 17:34.398
Winner wins a chicken dinner....

17:36.525 --> 17:37.619
Where's...

17:37.739 --> 17:40.749
Where's this TV you've been
bragging about?

17:40.780 --> 17:42.005
It's right here.

17:48.799 --> 17:50.262
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

17:51.513 --> 17:54.287
- Good night, boys.
- Night night, papa.

17:56.040 --> 17:58.089
- That was nice.
- Yeah.

18:01.246 --> 18:03.473
Well, you got to go.

18:03.537 --> 18:04.920
What?

18:05.320 --> 18:06.792
Oh, I'm sorry.

18:06.912 --> 18:09.033
That was a blast. And you're great.

18:09.334 --> 18:11.330
I have to be up early, so...

18:12.601 --> 18:15.252
You're just kicking me out?

18:17.207 --> 18:18.560
You knew what this was.

18:24.709 --> 18:27.197
Lily, Lily, wait.

18:29.120 --> 18:31.187
Don't forget your sweatshirt.
Nice try.

18:33.659 --> 18:36.296
- Teddy bear, Barndoor.
- Papa?

18:36.343 --> 18:38.729
Rise and shine, jackasses.

18:39.529 --> 18:41.565
So do you guys remember
anything from last night?

18:41.838 --> 18:43.287
Yeah...

18:43.861 --> 18:47.752
Boy, was Ted drunk. Embarrassing!

18:49.875 --> 18:52.253
I'm really sorry. We both are.

18:53.019 --> 18:55.506
We were drunk and stupid, but...

18:56.654 --> 19:00.638
We're gonna do anything we can to make
sure that Don feels a part of the group.

19:01.786 --> 19:03.495
Don's not gonna be a part of the group.

19:04.581 --> 19:06.140
And neither am I.

19:07.069 --> 19:08.299
At least for a while.

19:08.641 --> 19:11.645
Guys, this thing with Don is real.

19:12.424 --> 19:14.201
And I wanna see where it goes.

19:14.492 --> 19:16.101
And I'll never be able to do that

19:16.134 --> 19:18.967
if I keep hanging our with
my ex-boyfriends all the time.

19:19.327 --> 19:20.393
It just won't work.

19:23.256 --> 19:24.520
I'm moving in with Don.

19:38.509 --> 19:43.033
* It should be boredom by now... *

19:45.972 --> 19:49.170
* I know the tricks... *

19:49.290 --> 19:51.262
So, what's going on with Robin?

19:51.382 --> 19:53.379
You were right. She was just mad.

19:53.436 --> 19:55.609
It's been four days and she hasn't said
another word about moving out

19:55.626 --> 19:56.381
But listen...

19:56.755 --> 19:59.229
We can never pull crap like that
ever again.

19:59.349 --> 20:00.310
Agreed.

20:00.430 --> 20:03.878
In fact I even wrote myself
another letter.

20:03.998 --> 20:05.710
Dear future Barney,

20:06.060 --> 20:09.105
You think you want Robin back again
but you really don't.

20:09.340 --> 20:10.623
Let her go.

20:10.743 --> 20:13.196
Sincerely, past Barney.

20:13.977 --> 20:16.803
- Let me see that.
- Hey, hey, give it to me.

20:16.923 --> 20:20.479
P.S. That top part was just for Ted.
Did he buy it? good.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.843
Now get back together with Robin,
but don't mention your plan to Ted

20:23.879 --> 20:25.156
cause he'll just screw it up again.

20:26.553 --> 20:28.699
And then there's more drawings of boobs.

20:28.979 --> 20:31.890
Okay, okay. In my defense,

20:32.676 --> 20:34.945
- How great are boobs?
- They're pretty great.

20:35.245 --> 20:37.487
- They're pretty great.
- So...

20:38.740 --> 20:43.360
* I go for it every time *

20:44.863 --> 20:46.230
Robin!

20:46.462 --> 20:53.080
* Just like a heavy drinker...*

20:53.473 --> 21:02.896
* I go for it every time...
Hook, line and sinker *
