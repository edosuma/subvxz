WEBVTT

00:04.379 --> 00:05.797
Here you go.

00:07.758 --> 00:09.927
Jeez! Sorry, folks.

00:10.511 --> 00:11.595
Here.

00:11.720 --> 00:14.723
There we go. Free coffee all around.

00:15.516 --> 00:18.727
Might wanna put your hand over that.
There we go.

00:19.478 --> 00:21.522
Tom, what the hell is going on up there?

00:21.605 --> 00:23.732
We're redoing your apartment.
What'd you think?

00:23.815 --> 00:26.527
The ceiling's falling.
I got customers eating dry wall here.

00:26.610 --> 00:29.154
- That can't be good.
- You said minimal disruptions.

00:29.238 --> 00:32.658
This is minimal disruptions.
I need you to sign this change order.

00:32.698 --> 00:34.910
- What happened now?
- We broke through this wall...

00:34.993 --> 00:37.538
and found pipes that shouldn't be there.
Gotta move them.

00:37.621 --> 00:38.997
- Move them where?
- Not sure.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.458
- We gotta find out what they do first.
- You're kidding.

00:41.542 --> 00:44.628
Yeah, there's nothing I like more
than a good moving-a-pipe joke.

00:44.711 --> 00:46.672
Fine. One more week. That's it.

00:46.755 --> 00:49.174
Oh, sure, construction ultimatum.

00:49.591 --> 00:52.511
That's even funnier
than my moving-a-pipe joke.

00:55.222 --> 00:58.350
- Jeez, look at this place. It's a mess.
- How long...

00:58.433 --> 00:59.977
- No, can't sit here.
- Why not?

01:00.060 --> 01:02.229
Three people got nailed in the head
here earlier.

01:02.312 --> 01:04.897
- Their food was okay, right?
- Will you just move?

01:05.315 --> 01:06.400
Outside.

01:06.483 --> 01:10.487
You know, if I sit here one more second,
I just might be outside.

01:11.613 --> 01:13.448
Order me some coffee.

01:17.202 --> 01:20.914
You are really funny.
You and Tom should put an act together.

01:21.623 --> 01:23.292
I'd leave it open.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.004
Go ahead, Mom. I can hear you now.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.381
I wanted to know
if you'd like a gift certificate...

01:29.423 --> 01:32.676
- for a weekend at the Birchgrove Spa.
- Are you serious?

01:32.759 --> 01:35.554
I bid on it at
the DAR Symphony Fundraiser, and I won.

01:35.596 --> 01:38.515
It's supposed to be an amazing place.
Why don't you go?

01:38.599 --> 01:41.059
I've never had any real desire
to go to a spa.

01:41.101 --> 01:44.188
- Why did you bid on it?
- For charity. I had to bid on something.

01:44.271 --> 01:47.107
I certainly didn't want another portrait
of George Washington.

01:47.191 --> 01:48.692
I've got four in the attic already.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.485
- I'd love it.
- Good.

01:51.028 --> 01:53.405
Two days
of total mind-numbing pampering.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.407
Massages, facials, aromatherapy.

01:55.449 --> 01:57.034
You make it sound like heaven.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.912
- Closest you'll ever come to being a dog.
- I beg your pardon?

01:59.995 --> 02:02.748
You know, a whole life
of nothing but eating, sleeping...

02:02.831 --> 02:04.666
lying on your back and getting rubbed.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.793
I'd love the comparison to stop there.

02:06.877 --> 02:09.045
- When's it for?
- This weekend, actually.

02:09.128 --> 02:10.881
Well, I'll be there.

02:11.215 --> 02:12.925
- So will I.
- Excuse me?

02:12.966 --> 02:14.510
The certificate is for two.

02:14.593 --> 02:17.429
Since it sounds like
the most wonderful place in the world...

02:17.471 --> 02:19.181
I might as well try it with you.

02:19.264 --> 02:21.892
- But...
- That's all right, isn't it, if I join you?

02:21.975 --> 02:23.477
You don't mind?

02:23.560 --> 02:26.063
- No, I don't mind at all.
- Wonderful.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.148
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning.

02:28.232 --> 02:30.192
I'm actually looking forward to this.

02:30.275 --> 02:33.111
Oh, yeah, me, too. Thanks, Mom.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.030
Bye-bye.

02:39.743 --> 02:42.162
I'm going to a spa with my mother.

02:43.121 --> 02:44.581
Lean forward.

02:46.000 --> 02:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:46.894 --> 03:48.812
So, then we're all confirmed.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.773
Great. Thanks so much for your help.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.358
Okay. Bye.

03:53.567 --> 03:56.028
- Yes.
- That was an evil 'yes. '

03:56.111 --> 03:57.529
Not an evil 'yes. '

03:57.571 --> 04:01.200
It's a 'Yes, I'm pretty,
but, hello, I'm smart' kind of a 'yes. '

04:01.283 --> 04:02.326
My mistake.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.703
So here's the deal. I go into my facial...

04:04.745 --> 04:06.997
just as my mother
is finishing her Salt Glow...

04:07.080 --> 04:09.875
which'll end 10 minutes
after I've hit my scalp treatment...

04:09.958 --> 04:13.504
which puts me in the Watsu massage pool
six minutes into her back facial.

04:13.587 --> 04:16.464
The day is so well planned,
I won't see her until dinner...

04:16.548 --> 04:19.510
which'll be cut short
by the food poisoning I plan to contract.

04:19.593 --> 04:22.387
- You are 12 and disgusting.
- I am trapped and desperate.

04:22.471 --> 04:25.182
You really think you can avoid Grandma
the entire weekend?

04:25.265 --> 04:27.518
I'm nothing if not a great organizer.

04:27.601 --> 04:30.229
Now, let's talk about
what you're gonna do tonight.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.231
Throwing a party, I hope.

04:32.314 --> 04:35.776
Inviting hundreds of bikers and lowlifes
who are gonna trash the place.

04:35.817 --> 04:39.571
I am going to do laundry, watch TV,
order Indian food, and go to bed early.

04:39.655 --> 04:42.908
And then come the bikers and lowlifes
who are gonna trash the place?

04:42.950 --> 04:45.452
I may even fall asleep on the couch
with the TV on.

04:45.536 --> 04:48.038
When do the bikers and lowlifes
get to trash the place?

04:48.121 --> 04:49.248
You're all packed.

04:49.289 --> 04:52.084
You have to do something bad
when Mommy's out of town.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.920
It's the law.
You've seen Risky Business, right?

04:55.003 --> 04:57.422
Now, I'm not asking
for a prostitution ring...

04:57.506 --> 05:00.133
but how about a floating craps game
or something?

05:00.217 --> 05:03.095
- I'll see what I can do.
- I'd greatly appreciate it.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.347
I think Grandma's here.

05:05.430 --> 05:08.100
What's she honking for?
She hates honking.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.978
She calls it a mechanical bodily function.

05:12.229 --> 05:13.355
Jeez.

05:15.816 --> 05:16.900
Cool!

05:17.651 --> 05:19.319
Hello, hello, hello.

05:19.403 --> 05:20.779
What are we, going to the prom?

05:20.863 --> 05:23.532
I just thought since this weekend
is all about relaxing...

05:23.615 --> 05:25.075
we should start with the ride.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.244
- This is cool, Grandma.
- Thank you, Rory.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.747
- So are we all ready to go?
- I guess so, Miss Daisy.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.499
- Bye, sweets.
- Bye.

05:32.708 --> 05:34.835
- Bye, Grandma.
- Goodbye, Rory.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.503
Have a good time.

05:36.587 --> 05:38.839
- Bikers and lowlifes.
- I'll get right on it.

05:41.008 --> 05:44.845
In general, the lab reports weren't bad,
but they weren't great either...

05:44.928 --> 05:46.471
which leads me to question...

05:46.555 --> 05:50.475
whether everyone has the grasp
on electrochemistry I'd prefer...

05:50.517 --> 05:51.977
before we move on.

05:52.019 --> 05:55.272
To that end, I will be giving another test
on Tuesday...

05:55.355 --> 05:58.734
covering Chapters 14 through 18
in your textbooks...

05:59.026 --> 06:01.403
as well as the material from lab.

06:01.778 --> 06:04.990
Now please proceed with the assignment
we all started yesterday...

06:05.032 --> 06:07.951
as that, too, will be included on the test.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.293
- Madeline.
- What?

06:16.376 --> 06:18.754
- What are you guys doing tonight?
- It's Friday night.

06:18.837 --> 06:20.672
- So, you've got dates?
- Yeah, why?

06:20.756 --> 06:22.674
I was hoping you could study with me.

06:22.758 --> 06:24.176
- On a Friday night?
- Yes.

06:24.259 --> 06:26.303
- We've got dates.
- What is she saying?

06:26.386 --> 06:28.847
- She wants us to study with her.
- On a Friday night?

06:28.889 --> 06:30.265
- Yeah.
- But we've got dates.

06:30.349 --> 06:32.518
I know.
I was hoping maybe you'd cancel them.

06:32.559 --> 06:33.644
- To study?
- Yes.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.896
- On a Friday night?
- What did she say?

06:35.979 --> 06:38.148
She wants us to cancel our dates to study.

06:38.232 --> 06:40.692
- On a Friday night?
- That's what she said.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.529
- But we have...
- Oh, my God. Forget it!

06:46.949 --> 06:50.202
So I suppose that you have
big Friday night plans also?

06:50.244 --> 06:51.286
Kind of.

06:51.370 --> 06:54.206
The fact that I'm seeing
my entire Harvard career slip away...

06:54.248 --> 06:57.209
- is of no interest to anyone?
- What are you talking about?

06:57.292 --> 06:59.378
- I got an A-minus, okay?
- So?

06:59.461 --> 07:00.754
What do you mean 'so'?

07:00.838 --> 07:03.549
I got an A-minus.
I have never gotten an A-minus.

07:03.590 --> 07:06.969
I just can't focus lately.
Things are so weird at my house.

07:07.052 --> 07:10.514
My dad figured out exactly how much
it'd cost him to divorce my mom.

07:10.597 --> 07:11.765
So now he's back.

07:11.849 --> 07:14.726
It's bad enough I wasted time
crunching the numbers with him...

07:14.810 --> 07:18.146
but now that he's back, they're fighting
and redecorating. It's a mess.

07:18.230 --> 07:19.481
I need help.

07:19.648 --> 07:21.191
Look, I can't tonight...

07:21.275 --> 07:24.152
but if you're still freaked out
after the quiz on Tuesday...

07:24.236 --> 07:27.698
I will spend every day next week
helping you prepare for the final, okay?

07:27.781 --> 07:29.324
- I guess.
- Relax.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.535
It will be fine. I promise.

07:31.618 --> 07:36.373
All I had to do was move a decimal point,
and none of this would have happened.

07:37.624 --> 07:40.169
Look at this place. It's lovely.

07:40.711 --> 07:42.963
And that smell. What is that? Eucalyptus?

07:43.046 --> 07:45.299
- I don't know.
- Well, it's lovely.

07:45.382 --> 07:47.593
Lorelai, come over here. Look.

07:47.843 --> 07:50.512
- They have cucumber slices in the water.
- Wow.

07:50.596 --> 07:53.974
If they have ranch dressing
in the soap dispensers, this place is great.

07:54.057 --> 07:55.684
You know what? I love it here.

07:55.767 --> 07:58.103
Careful. That's how they get you
in the Moonies.

07:58.145 --> 08:00.272
I feel more relaxed already.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.401
That's the most delicious water I've had.
Have a sip.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.070
- Let's just check in, shall we?
- Okay.

08:07.905 --> 08:11.575
Hello. I'm Emily Gilmore.
This is my daughter Lorelai.

08:11.658 --> 08:14.411
Yes, welcome to Birchgrove.
My name is Bobby.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.288
I have everything all set for you.

08:16.371 --> 08:18.874
- Any luggage?
- It's in the Luca Brasi-mobile out front.

08:18.957 --> 08:20.918
We can take care of that for you.

08:21.001 --> 08:25.214
Here are your room keys
and a copy of all of your spa activities.

08:25.297 --> 08:27.132
You ladies are booked solid, I see.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.801
We intend to leave here
completely different people.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.179
Yes, I'm going to be Ted Nugent.

08:32.346 --> 08:34.640
Anyhow, your rooms
are right down this hall.

08:34.722 --> 08:37.142
Fruit and yogurt is served
by the pool in the mornings.

08:37.226 --> 08:39.352
Lunch and dinner seatings
are on that itinerary.

08:39.436 --> 08:40.687
- Any questions?
- Yes.

08:40.770 --> 08:43.023
Where can one get a cup of coffee
around here?

08:43.106 --> 08:45.442
We don't serve anything
with caffeine here.

08:45.526 --> 08:47.528
And you think that's safe?

08:47.736 --> 08:50.864
Thank you. We're sure we're going to have
a wonderful time.

08:50.948 --> 08:52.324
Mom, there's no coffee.

08:52.407 --> 08:55.118
It won't kill you
to go two days without coffee.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.578
No, I think it will.

08:56.662 --> 08:59.122
Just focus on all the pampering
we're going to have.

08:59.164 --> 09:01.542
Look at all the things
we have to look forward to.

09:01.625 --> 09:02.626
- Oh, no.
- What?

09:02.709 --> 09:05.754
I'll be right back.
They screwed up our appointments.

09:05.838 --> 09:07.714
- Again?
- What do you mean, 'again'?

09:07.798 --> 09:11.134
On the way to your house, I called
to confirm our schedule and found...

09:11.176 --> 09:13.971
they had booked us separately
for every one of our treatments.

09:14.012 --> 09:17.766
I insisted on speaking to a manager
and was able to straighten everything out.

09:17.850 --> 09:19.518
- Yes, those are right.
- They are?

09:19.601 --> 09:22.396
I had them move the pedicure tubs
together in the same room...

09:22.479 --> 09:25.607
- so we can talk during it.
- I'm really gonna need a cup of coffee.

09:25.691 --> 09:28.402
- Have some cucumber water.
- No, that's not gonna do it...

09:28.485 --> 09:30.487
- Drink, Lorelai.
- Cucumber water. Yuck.

09:40.122 --> 09:42.541
Well, your lung capacity
certainly has improved.

09:42.624 --> 09:45.210
Well, I've been playing
a lot more basketball lately.

09:45.294 --> 09:49.548
Yet another reason to continue the fight
to keep physical education in schools.

09:50.591 --> 09:52.342
- So, tonight...
- Yes?

09:52.509 --> 09:54.136
- I was thinking...
- Yes?

09:54.219 --> 09:57.848
Since your mother's going to be gone,
maybe I'd come over.

09:58.557 --> 09:59.516
What?

09:59.600 --> 10:02.644
I was thinking of pulling
kind of a hermit thing tonight.

10:02.728 --> 10:03.979
- Why?
- I don't know.

10:04.062 --> 10:05.689
J.D. Salinger seems to dig it.

10:05.772 --> 10:08.025
- You don't want me to come over?
- No, I just...

10:08.066 --> 10:11.820
I almost never get the house all to myself,
and I thought with my mom gone...

10:11.904 --> 10:14.364
I can finally do my laundry
exactly the way I like it.

10:14.448 --> 10:17.534
Not separating into whites and colors,
but the colors separated...

10:17.618 --> 10:18.994
into darks, mediums, and lights.

10:19.077 --> 10:20.913
With a separate pile for white T-shirts...

10:20.954 --> 10:22.498
and T-shirts with writing on them...

10:22.581 --> 10:24.541
like 'Rock Star,'
'Evil,' or 'Kafka Was Here. '

10:24.625 --> 10:26.335
You want to be alone to do laundry?

10:26.418 --> 10:30.506
And watch TV, and eat the Indian food
I love but my mom hates the smell of...

10:30.589 --> 10:32.424
and go to bed early, and...

10:32.508 --> 10:33.926
Are you mad?

10:34.009 --> 10:37.262
Why would I be mad?
You want to spend tonight alone.

10:37.346 --> 10:40.599
But tomorrow,
the whole day is all about you.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.684
I mean it. From morning till night.

10:42.768 --> 10:44.102
You plan it, or I'll plan it...

10:44.144 --> 10:46.939
or we can get a professional to plan it,
whatever you want.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.149
- Just don't be mad.
- I'm not.

10:51.735 --> 10:53.445
- I'm not mad.
- Good.

10:53.695 --> 10:56.740
- I'm confused, but I'm not mad.
- Fine.

10:57.074 --> 10:59.284
I'm a saint, but I'm not mad.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.411
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

11:02.079 --> 11:04.373
So, deep breath, and...

11:27.271 --> 11:29.982
- How do I look?
- Like a landlady. What is this?

11:30.065 --> 11:31.108
I got adjoining rooms.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.485
We don't have to go out in the hall
to see each other.

11:33.569 --> 11:34.611
Great thinking.

11:34.695 --> 11:37.781
God, this robe is fabulous.
How do they get it so soft?

11:37.865 --> 11:40.993
Having about 40 other people wear it first
is part of the secret.

11:41.076 --> 11:43.120
Stop it. So are you all ready...

11:43.161 --> 11:47.166
for our skin-rejuvenating and revitalizing
collagen facial and eye treatment?

11:47.249 --> 11:48.458
Almost.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.878
It has vitamin C and plant extracts in it...

11:50.961 --> 11:53.338
which is the hottest thing
in skincare these days.

11:53.422 --> 11:55.841
The eye treatment
is supposed to reduce puffiness...

11:55.883 --> 11:58.218
and minimize the appearance of fine lines.

11:58.302 --> 12:00.012
Okay, no more brochures for you.

12:00.095 --> 12:01.430
I'm ready. Let's go.

12:01.513 --> 12:03.056
- Aren't you wearing your robe?
- What?

12:03.140 --> 12:04.516
You're supposed to wear a robe.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.393
They'll give me one when I get there.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.353
- But these robes are wonderful.
- Mom.

12:08.437 --> 12:09.438
They help you relax.

12:09.521 --> 12:12.441
- We're late, Mom.
- They're wonderful, relaxing robes.

12:12.524 --> 12:14.234
- Oh, my God.
- Yet you stand there...

12:14.318 --> 12:17.863
like it's some badge of honor
not to put on your robe like everyone else.

12:17.946 --> 12:20.282
This isn't for me, you know. It's for you.

12:20.365 --> 12:23.452
I already have on my robe.
I am already relaxed.

12:25.370 --> 12:28.123
- What are you doing?
- You're kidding me, right?

12:28.207 --> 12:30.876
Well, hurry up. We're going to be late.

12:32.461 --> 12:33.629
Happy?

12:33.921 --> 12:37.049
Apparently, you didn't see
the matching slippers.

12:40.511 --> 12:42.888
So, how are we doing?

12:43.180 --> 12:44.640
- So good.
- Okay.

12:44.723 --> 12:48.060
I'm gonna leave you to sit
for a few minutes, so relax and enjoy...

12:48.101 --> 12:50.437
- and I'll be right back.
- Thanks.

13:12.501 --> 13:15.295
- Are your feet sweating?
- Mom?

13:15.712 --> 13:18.882
Those booties make my feet sweat.
Don't they make your feet sweat?

13:18.966 --> 13:20.926
What are you doing in my room?

13:20.968 --> 13:24.555
Magda left me sitting for 20 minutes.
Fine time to take a coffee break.

13:24.596 --> 13:26.431
She's not taking a coffee break.

13:26.515 --> 13:29.768
Your skin is supposed to be absorbing
the moisture in your mask.

13:29.852 --> 13:31.311
In your room.

13:32.145 --> 13:35.190
Let's see what's next on our agenda,
shall we?

13:35.899 --> 13:39.111
Stop moving, Lorelai.
You'll electrocute yourself.

13:39.528 --> 13:41.405
The Egyptian mud bath.

13:42.155 --> 13:45.325
I wonder if a mud bath is one
of those things you see in brochures...

13:45.409 --> 13:49.538
where they wrap you in towels
like you're in a cocoon of some sort.

13:49.830 --> 13:51.540
That might be nice.

13:51.623 --> 13:54.293
Especially if their towels
are as good as their robes.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.712
Because I just love these robes.

13:58.172 --> 13:59.756
Wonder where they get these robes.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.717
Shouldn't be hard
to find the manufacturer.

14:01.800 --> 14:04.553
I could order a few of them.
For me, you, and Rory.

14:04.636 --> 14:07.222
I still can't get over it. It really was mud.

14:07.306 --> 14:08.849
I mean, I know it said mud bath...

14:08.932 --> 14:11.310
but I didn't really think
they meant a real mud bath.

14:11.393 --> 14:14.062
The odd thing is,
I should've been more repulsed by it.

14:14.146 --> 14:17.024
Sitting in a tub of hot dirt,
which is basically what mud is...

14:17.107 --> 14:20.152
should have made me ill,
and yet, I really enjoyed it.

14:20.235 --> 14:22.279
Did yours have twigs? Mine had twigs.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.364
When I asked the woman about them...

14:24.448 --> 14:28.243
she told me they were there
because of the healing qualities.

14:31.413 --> 14:34.958
What are you doing? Lorelai, stop it!
You're pushing me.

14:43.509 --> 14:45.802
How's the pressure? Too much?

14:48.847 --> 14:51.850
- Yep.
- Sorry. I'll go lighter.

14:52.267 --> 14:54.144
Your hands are amazing.

14:54.228 --> 14:56.522
Compliment your masseur's hands,
Lorelai.

14:56.605 --> 14:57.898
Oh, my God.

14:57.981 --> 14:59.691
- Excuse me?
- Nothing.

14:59.733 --> 15:01.693
You were muttering under your breath.

15:01.777 --> 15:04.655
Years of experience have taught me
that when you do that...

15:04.696 --> 15:06.323
it's usually about me.

15:07.741 --> 15:10.661
Mom, you signed us up
for a couple's massage.

15:10.744 --> 15:13.288
- So?
- A couple's massage is for a couple...

15:13.372 --> 15:14.832
not a couple of people.

15:14.873 --> 15:17.709
It's more efficient this way.
We finish at the same time.

15:17.751 --> 15:20.295
Do you know what most people
who get these massages do...

15:20.379 --> 15:23.257
about five minutes after it's over?
They have sex, together...

15:23.340 --> 15:25.843
probably while wearing their robes.

15:25.926 --> 15:29.888
Could the two of you excuse us
for a moment, please? Thank you.

15:32.558 --> 15:35.227
- Well, that was appalling.
- Well, that was true.

15:35.310 --> 15:37.396
You're determined to spoil this,
aren't you?

15:37.479 --> 15:39.481
Why, because I want
a quiet, private massage?

15:39.565 --> 15:41.942
You've been pouting and sulking
and sighing...

15:42.025 --> 15:44.778
- I haven't been sighing.
... rolling your eyes, mumbling.

15:44.862 --> 15:46.113
That's how I detox.

15:46.196 --> 15:49.199
You've made it your mission
to be as miserable as possible.

15:49.283 --> 15:50.951
- That's not true.
- It's completely true.

15:51.034 --> 15:53.036
If you don't care
about hurting my feelings...

15:53.120 --> 15:55.873
maybe you care that you're wasting
all your relaxing time...

15:55.914 --> 15:58.375
acting like a petulant 4-year-old.

16:00.043 --> 16:01.378
I'm sorry.

16:01.587 --> 16:04.339
Do you want me
to try to get myself another room?

16:04.423 --> 16:05.424
No.

16:05.507 --> 16:07.384
I saw a supply closet down the hall.

16:07.426 --> 16:09.261
Maybe my masseur
could finish me in there.

16:09.344 --> 16:10.429
Okay, Mom.

16:10.512 --> 16:13.223
Or perhaps I could roll myself
against a stucco wall...

16:13.307 --> 16:15.434
eliminate the need
for a masseur altogether.

16:15.517 --> 16:17.394
Lie down, Mom, please.

16:18.145 --> 16:19.688
If you say so.

16:23.817 --> 16:26.153
- Lorelai?
- Yes, Mom.

16:26.528 --> 16:28.989
Would you go get the boys, please?

16:38.373 --> 16:43.003
No, that's two orders of garlic nan,
three samosas, and a Chicken vindaloo.

16:43.086 --> 16:46.965
And rice. And the green sauce.
And no salad. And...

16:47.341 --> 16:49.968
Oh, wait. Sorry, can you hold on a sec?

16:50.052 --> 16:52.095
- Hello?
- Hi. This is Phil's Liquor.

16:52.179 --> 16:54.264
I'm supposed to deliver
a keg there tonight.

16:54.348 --> 16:55.599
Hold on.

16:56.225 --> 16:58.477
Hi. Sorry. Yeah, that's it.

16:59.102 --> 17:01.104
Forty minutes. Great. Bye.

17:02.814 --> 17:04.316
- Who was that?
- Sandeep's.

17:04.398 --> 17:06.443
You're ordering the Indian food.

17:06.527 --> 17:07.569
- Yep.
- Good, enjoy.

17:07.653 --> 17:10.656
Burn the house down after.
It's the only way to get the smell out.

17:10.739 --> 17:12.532
- Absolutely. How's the spa?
- Tranquil.

17:12.616 --> 17:13.992
- Really?
- I wasn't done.

17:14.076 --> 17:16.369
Tranquilizers will be required...

17:16.453 --> 17:18.664
if I have to spend one more minute
with my mother.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.707
Tell me you're trying to get along with her.

17:20.790 --> 17:22.416
- I'm being a peach.
- Really?

17:22.501 --> 17:24.586
Well, I smell like a peach.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.922
- Was that the doorbell?
- Yeah. Call you later.

17:27.005 --> 17:28.382
Wait. I wanna find out who it is.

17:28.464 --> 17:31.468
The sooner you get back to your weekend,
the sooner it'll be over.

17:31.552 --> 17:34.763
Can you get out my address book
and count how many friends I have?

17:34.847 --> 17:36.181
- Bye.
- Mean.

17:36.223 --> 17:37.724
Steal me soap.

17:38.934 --> 17:39.977
Paris, what...

17:40.018 --> 17:42.229
I tried to stay home and study myself,
but I can't.

17:42.312 --> 17:43.689
I don't know what anything means.

17:43.772 --> 17:46.233
I can't even read my own handwriting.
What does this say?

17:46.316 --> 17:48.694
Whoever wrote this
should be dressed in a clown suit...

17:48.777 --> 17:50.529
stuffing bodies under their porch.

17:50.612 --> 17:52.447
- You're in your pajamas.
- I know.

17:52.531 --> 17:55.492
This was the big night you planned?
A rendezvous with Mr. Peanut?

17:55.576 --> 17:57.077
- L...
- You're doing laundry.

17:57.161 --> 17:59.329
- Yes.
- You're doing laundry in your pajamas.

17:59.413 --> 18:02.207
My mom's out of town,
and I never get the house all to myself.

18:02.291 --> 18:04.543
You never go months
without seeing your parents...

18:04.585 --> 18:06.795
getting a postcard
that doesn't have a courtesy...

18:06.879 --> 18:08.380
'Wish you were here' written on it?

18:08.463 --> 18:10.716
- That sucks. Don't let me stand in the way.
- Wait.

18:10.799 --> 18:12.551
No. I don't wanna get in the way.

18:12.593 --> 18:14.636
I hear there'll be
some hot knitting going on.

18:14.720 --> 18:16.722
- Fine, I'll study with you.
- You will?

18:16.805 --> 18:18.223
For one hour. That's it.

18:18.265 --> 18:21.435
We'll do a quick review and a pop quiz,
and then you're going home.

18:21.518 --> 18:22.561
- Deal?
- Deal.

18:22.644 --> 18:24.730
Okay. So, go sit on the couch.

18:24.813 --> 18:27.065
- I'll be out in a minute.
- Where are you going?

18:27.149 --> 18:28.567
I'm going to go change.

18:28.650 --> 18:32.696
Okay, but my hour doesn't start
till you get back out here, right?

18:36.575 --> 18:39.578
- You ready?
- Wow, you look great, Mom.

18:39.661 --> 18:42.873
- Are you being sarcastic?
- No, I'm being completely serious.

18:42.915 --> 18:44.708
Oh, well, thank you.

18:45.876 --> 18:47.878
That's a pretty color. What is that?

18:47.961 --> 18:50.672
- It's called 'Vicious Trollop. '
- Stop it.

18:51.131 --> 18:53.717
Why would you name a lipstick
something like that?

18:53.759 --> 18:56.261
- 'Cause 'Dirty Whore' was taken?
- You frighten me.

18:56.345 --> 18:57.888
- Wanna try some?
- No, thank you.

18:57.930 --> 19:00.057
- Go on, Mom, try it.
- It won't look good on me.

19:00.098 --> 19:01.433
Sure it will.

19:01.475 --> 19:05.479
- All right, but if I look ridiculous...
- I'll be the first one to point it out.

19:05.562 --> 19:07.648
You're a vicious trollop.

19:07.731 --> 19:09.316
- Lorelai.
- Sorry.

19:09.858 --> 19:10.901
Well?

19:10.943 --> 19:12.819
- I like it.
- You do?

19:13.946 --> 19:16.949
- I like it, too.
- Good, let's go then. I'm starving.

19:17.032 --> 19:19.535
Me, too. What are they serving
for dinner tonight?

19:19.618 --> 19:21.245
Well, let's see.

19:26.542 --> 19:29.002
They certainly do like their tofu here,
don't they?

19:29.086 --> 19:30.963
And the word 'steamed. '

19:31.713 --> 19:33.507
Well, they have dessert at least.

19:33.590 --> 19:36.093
Cookies sweetened
with sprouted mung bean.

19:36.134 --> 19:38.679
- That sounds dreadful.
- Yes, it does.

19:39.304 --> 19:42.516
Where are you going? You're not
changing? Our seating's in 10 minutes.

19:42.599 --> 19:43.642
Get your coat.

19:43.725 --> 19:45.269
I don't need it for the dining room.

19:45.310 --> 19:47.229
- We're not going there.
- Where are we going?

19:47.312 --> 19:48.438
- Out.
- Out where?

19:48.522 --> 19:52.317
We're going to leave the spa,
find a restaurant, and have a steak.

19:52.359 --> 19:54.194
- A steak?
- Who's gonna stop us?

19:54.278 --> 19:57.281
- A steak.
- Come on, Mom. What's it gonna be?

19:57.322 --> 20:00.409
Vicious trollop
or the wide world of mung beans?

20:00.492 --> 20:02.828
- Let's go.
- I'm right behind you.

20:04.371 --> 20:07.666
Given that those are the reactions
occurring in the two half-cells...

20:07.749 --> 20:09.001
what do you do next?

20:09.042 --> 20:11.295
We add them together,
doubling the coefficients...

20:11.336 --> 20:13.463
of the silver half equation
but not the voltage.

20:13.547 --> 20:15.549
We get the equation
for the complete reaction.

20:15.632 --> 20:18.177
You're in much better shape
than you wanna think you are.

20:18.260 --> 20:19.595
Impossible.

20:21.054 --> 20:22.681
- Where are you going?
- That's my food.

20:22.764 --> 20:26.018
- Another half hour. Please.
- No. You got your hour, you need to go.

20:26.101 --> 20:27.144
- But...
- Go.

20:27.186 --> 20:28.312
Fine.

20:29.313 --> 20:30.772
- Delivery.
- What're you doing here?

20:30.856 --> 20:34.109
Luke figured since you're alone,
you wouldn't have food in the house.

20:34.193 --> 20:35.527
So he sent over a care package.

20:35.569 --> 20:38.197
I don't need a care package.
I ordered from Sandeep's.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.532
Really? Plan on burning down
the house afterwards?

20:40.574 --> 20:42.159
The only way to kill the smell.

20:42.242 --> 20:44.661
Where should I put this? Kitchen?

20:46.330 --> 20:47.456
Sure.

20:51.043 --> 20:54.213
God, how much food is in there?
This could feed 12.

20:54.296 --> 20:56.048
Excuse me, I've seen you eat.

20:56.089 --> 20:58.467
- Fine, six.
- Well, he wanted you taken care of.

20:58.550 --> 21:00.677
Wasn't sure how long your mom
would be gone for.

21:00.719 --> 21:02.638
- Just tonight.
- He didn't know that.

21:02.721 --> 21:04.681
- Now you can tell him.
- I will.

21:04.765 --> 21:06.725
So, how come Caesar
didn't bring this over?

21:06.767 --> 21:08.685
- I volunteered.
- Why?

21:08.727 --> 21:10.729
Wanted to get out
of the construction zone.

21:10.812 --> 21:13.065
There's nothing but banging and yelling.

21:13.106 --> 21:15.192
Place gives me a headache.

21:15.901 --> 21:18.695
Why, did you think I wanted
to come over here and see you?

21:18.737 --> 21:20.364
- No.
- I just needed some quiet.

21:20.447 --> 21:21.532
- Fine.
- That's all.

21:21.573 --> 21:22.616
- Got it.
- Clear my head.

21:22.699 --> 21:23.909
I understand.

21:23.992 --> 21:26.578
- So aren't you gonna eat?
- Eventually.

21:26.662 --> 21:28.747
- It gets cold fast.
- I can heat it up.

21:28.831 --> 21:30.916
Reheated French fries really suck.

21:30.999 --> 21:32.209
They do suck.

21:32.251 --> 21:33.752
Yeah, so eat.

21:34.169 --> 21:35.671
Okay, I will.

21:37.047 --> 21:39.758
- You're still standing there.
- You didn't give me a tip.

21:39.842 --> 21:42.469
- You want money?
- No. I'll take a fry, though.

21:42.761 --> 21:44.721
Okay. Yeah. Have as much as you want.

21:44.763 --> 21:46.223
Okay, great.

21:48.517 --> 21:49.685
What are you doing?

21:49.768 --> 21:51.728
- Getting ready to eat.
- You're staying?

21:51.812 --> 21:54.106
- Didn't you just invite me?
- No, I...

21:54.147 --> 21:57.609
You told me to have all I wanted.
That sounded invitation-like.

21:57.651 --> 21:59.611
You want to stay here and eat?

21:59.695 --> 22:01.488
- Beats being at Luke's.
- But...

22:01.572 --> 22:03.240
I can't find my flashcards.

22:03.282 --> 22:04.992
I didn't know you had company.

22:05.075 --> 22:06.785
This is Paris. We were just studying.

22:06.869 --> 22:10.038
Don't worry. I was just leaving.
If you find my flashcards, call me.

22:10.122 --> 22:11.165
- No.
- What?

22:11.248 --> 22:12.457
Stay for dinner.

22:12.499 --> 22:14.459
- But I thought...
- We have a ton of food...

22:14.501 --> 22:16.461
and we can go over the notes more later.

22:16.545 --> 22:17.963
- You sure?
- Positive.

22:18.046 --> 22:19.882
- Is that mac and cheese?
- Sure is.

22:19.965 --> 22:21.633
- I love mac and cheese.
- Great.

22:21.717 --> 22:24.261
- I'm not allowed to have mac and cheese.
- Splurge.

22:24.303 --> 22:25.637
Come on, Paris, stay.

22:25.721 --> 22:29.099
Do you have a 24-hour pharmacy
in case I have an allergic reaction?

22:29.141 --> 22:31.059
- Believe it or not, we do.
- Okay.

22:31.143 --> 22:34.021
- Can I borrow your phone?
- It's by the door.

22:34.521 --> 22:36.315
- Interesting.
- What is?

22:36.398 --> 22:38.650
- You think we need a chaperon?
- No, I don't.

22:38.692 --> 22:41.320
- You just invited one.
- Just being polite.

22:41.403 --> 22:42.654
Paris is alone tonight...

22:42.738 --> 22:44.948
and you yourself said
we have enough food for six.

22:44.990 --> 22:47.326
- With me, it's down to four.
- With Paris, it's two.

22:47.409 --> 22:49.286
- Works out well.
- I think so.

23:13.644 --> 23:15.354
My goodness, look at this place.

23:15.395 --> 23:18.357
I bet there's no cucumber slices
in the water here.

23:18.398 --> 23:20.484
- Hi, there. Party of two.
- Okay.

23:20.526 --> 23:23.570
I can take your name, but I won't have
a table for about an hour.

23:23.654 --> 23:25.405
- An hour?
- I can't wait an hour.

23:25.489 --> 23:26.949
- Me neither.
- I'll pass out.

23:27.032 --> 23:28.742
Go first. You can break my fall.

23:28.826 --> 23:30.702
- Can we bribe you?
- Sorry.

23:30.786 --> 23:32.996
- Please? She's loaded.
- Lorelai!

23:33.038 --> 23:34.957
A couple of stools opened up at the bar...

23:35.040 --> 23:36.583
and we serve our entire menu there.

23:36.667 --> 23:38.377
That is a great idea. Thanks. Come on.

23:38.418 --> 23:41.255
- We can't eat dinner at a bar.
- I don't wanna wait an hour.

23:41.338 --> 23:43.298
I'm wearing the wrong shoes
for a drive-thru.

23:43.382 --> 23:44.424
What'll people think?

23:44.508 --> 23:46.635
That we're loose women
with questionable morals.

23:46.718 --> 23:49.555
It's not right to eat dinner
when your feet don't touch the floor.

23:49.596 --> 23:52.474
- What can I get you ladies?
- Hi, Steve. Nice to meet you.

23:52.558 --> 23:55.769
- We will have two martinis?
- Why not?

23:55.853 --> 23:59.022
Two vodka martinis straight up
with a twist, very dry, very cold...

23:59.064 --> 24:01.233
- and a couple of menus.
- And some peanuts.

24:01.316 --> 24:02.734
Peanuts. Good idea.

24:02.818 --> 24:04.611
Here you go. I'll get your drinks.

24:04.695 --> 24:06.989
Thank you. You're a good man, Steve.

24:07.072 --> 24:11.118
Okay, I'm thinking steak
and Caesar salad, if it's not too anchovy-y.

24:11.201 --> 24:13.203
Do you wanna split
a shrimp cocktail to start?

24:13.287 --> 24:14.580
That sounds fine.

24:14.621 --> 24:18.167
I just love the idea of shrimp cocktail
with a steak dinner, you know?

24:18.250 --> 24:20.502
It's so casino, Big Joe, steak and shrimp.

24:20.586 --> 24:21.962
Save some for winter.

24:22.045 --> 24:24.423
I never realized
how wonderful peanuts were before.

24:24.506 --> 24:26.675
- Want a refill?
- Yes, please.

24:28.093 --> 24:30.345
- Cheers, Mom.
- Cheers.

24:35.434 --> 24:38.103
- I must tell you, I never expected this.
- What?

24:38.187 --> 24:40.105
Me inhaling peanuts at a singles bar.

24:40.189 --> 24:42.733
This isn't a singles bar, Mom.
It's a 60-40 bar.

24:42.774 --> 24:43.817
A what?

24:43.901 --> 24:45.944
60-year-old men hitting on
40-year-old women.

24:46.028 --> 24:47.696
- Divorcées, mostly.
- Really?

24:47.779 --> 24:49.114
Look around.

24:52.451 --> 24:55.287
Now, she can do better than that.
What does she see in him?

24:55.329 --> 24:57.956
Big will, short life span. The usual draw.

24:59.958 --> 25:02.002
I wonder if they have pretzels, too.

25:02.085 --> 25:05.422
Don't look now, but I think
you're passing for a 40-year-old woman.

25:05.464 --> 25:06.548
What?

25:06.632 --> 25:09.551
2:00, silver fox, totally checking you out.

25:11.595 --> 25:14.097
- He is not.
- Well, he's not staring at Steve.

25:14.181 --> 25:16.266
You're being ridiculous.

25:19.269 --> 25:21.730
He's definitely not looking at me.

25:24.399 --> 25:27.486
- He's still looking.
- Drink your martini, Lorelai.

25:29.279 --> 25:32.157
- A tragic waste of paper.
- I can't believe you just said that.

25:32.241 --> 25:35.118
It's true. The Beats' writing
was completely self-indulgent.

25:35.160 --> 25:37.287
I have one word for Jack Kerouac: Edit.

25:37.371 --> 25:40.582
It was not self-indulgent.
The Beats believed in shocking people...

25:40.666 --> 25:41.792
stirring things up.

25:41.834 --> 25:43.919
They believed in drugs, booze,
and petty crime.

25:44.002 --> 25:46.755
They expose you to a world
you wouldn't have otherwise known.

25:46.839 --> 25:48.298
Isn't it what great writing's about?

25:48.382 --> 25:51.426
It wasn't great writing.
It was the National Enquirer of the '50s.

25:51.510 --> 25:53.136
- You're cracked.
- Typical guy response.

25:53.178 --> 25:54.471
Worship Kerouac and Bukowski.

25:54.513 --> 25:56.682
God forbid you pick up anything
by Jane Austen.

25:56.765 --> 25:58.684
- I've read Jane Austen.
- You have?

25:58.767 --> 26:01.019
Yeah. And I think
she would have liked Bukowski.

26:01.061 --> 26:03.063
- What are you doing?
- Salt and peppered it.

26:03.146 --> 26:04.523
- Only way to eat a fry.
- Really?

26:04.606 --> 26:06.191
It's fast-food gospel.

26:09.069 --> 26:11.280
That's good. That's really good.

26:11.363 --> 26:14.116
- Do you like hot sauce?
- I don't know. Should I?

26:14.783 --> 26:16.243
I think it's wise.

26:16.326 --> 26:17.327
Hello?

26:18.704 --> 26:21.415
- Where are you?
- On my way to see you, if that's okay.

26:21.498 --> 26:24.042
I know you wanna be alone.
I'll only stay a minute.

26:24.126 --> 26:26.170
- I just want to say hi.
- You said hi.

26:26.211 --> 26:29.381
- I want to say hi a little closer.
- But I'm a mess.

26:29.464 --> 26:31.425
It's not pretty. You won't recognize me.

26:31.508 --> 26:33.677
Then put a nametag on, 'cause I miss you.

26:33.719 --> 26:36.138
- I miss you, too, but...
- But what?

26:36.847 --> 26:38.557
- Paris is here.
- Why?

26:38.640 --> 26:41.351
She freaked out about a grade
and wanted to go over notes.

26:41.393 --> 26:43.020
You know her, she will not be denied.

26:43.061 --> 26:46.023
I'm not really ruining your alone night.
Someone else did that.

26:46.064 --> 26:48.192
- Yes, but...
- I'll see you in a sec.

26:48.692 --> 26:50.068
Can't get into poetry.

26:50.110 --> 26:52.863
It's like,'Jeez, just say it already.
We're dying here. '

26:52.905 --> 26:56.033
I just noticed the time,
and it's getting really late.

26:56.116 --> 26:57.201
It's 7:00.

26:57.242 --> 27:00.496
I know, but Paris and I still have
a lot more studying to do.

27:00.579 --> 27:03.415
Jess, please thank Luke for me.
It was really nice of him.

27:03.499 --> 27:05.125
- Who was that on the phone?
- No one.

27:05.209 --> 27:07.628
'No one' wouldn't be
heading over here, would he?

27:07.711 --> 27:09.004
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

27:09.087 --> 27:11.673
Dean's on his way,
and Rory doesn't want him to find me.

27:11.757 --> 27:13.383
- Why?
- You know why.

27:13.425 --> 27:16.386
- We're just eating dinner.
- Jess, I'm asking you as a friend.

27:16.428 --> 27:19.014
- Please leave now.
- You really want me to go?

27:19.097 --> 27:21.558
I really want to avoid a fight with Dean.

27:22.935 --> 27:25.395
- Okay, I'm going.
- Thank you.

27:27.439 --> 27:28.732
What?

27:28.774 --> 27:31.485
I just twisted my ankle.
I better go lie down.

27:32.528 --> 27:36.198
You're no fun when you're tense.
Are you sure you want me to go?

27:36.281 --> 27:38.408
Maybe this can be solved
between me and Dean...

27:38.492 --> 27:40.160
if we had a little heart-to-heart.

27:40.244 --> 27:42.704
He could tell me his issues,
I'll tell him mine.

27:42.788 --> 27:44.915
- I promise I'll speak slowly.
- Bye.

27:46.124 --> 27:48.168
Give him my best, would you?

27:48.252 --> 27:51.296
Actually, I guess I could do that myself.

27:51.380 --> 27:53.799
Dean, Jess just came by
to bring me some food.

27:53.841 --> 27:54.925
From Luke's.

27:54.967 --> 27:56.802
- He wanted to make sure I ate.
- Luke did.

27:56.844 --> 27:58.720
Personally, I could care less if she eats.

27:58.804 --> 28:00.389
True, he could care less.

28:00.472 --> 28:02.724
I see you brought a little something, too.

28:02.808 --> 28:05.769
Is that ice cream? That's so nice.

28:06.144 --> 28:08.939
A tiny little ice-cream package
just big enough for two.

28:08.981 --> 28:12.943
Are you guys gonna feed each other?
'Cause that's just so darn cute.

28:14.236 --> 28:16.905
You're doing that towering-over-me thing.

28:16.989 --> 28:19.241
I tell you, you've really got that down.

28:19.324 --> 28:21.493
It helps that you're 12 feet tall.

28:21.577 --> 28:24.621
But this Frankenstein scowl
really adds to the whole...

28:24.663 --> 28:26.832
- Jess!
- Okay, I'm going.

28:28.250 --> 28:30.919
Look, man, I really was
just dropping off some food...

28:31.003 --> 28:33.714
so don't get all West Side Story
on me, okay?

28:35.340 --> 28:38.510
So, do you want to come in?

28:38.677 --> 28:40.512
What the hell is going on?

28:41.763 --> 28:44.433
- Dean, you remember Paris, right?
- Yeah, hi.

28:45.559 --> 28:47.895
So Jess just dropped this off?

28:48.520 --> 28:52.191
Now, I know you eat fast, but this is
a lot of food to put away that quickly...

28:52.274 --> 28:54.985
- even on your best day.
- Okay, he didn't just drop it off.

28:55.027 --> 28:56.987
- You told me you were doing laundry.
- I was.

28:57.029 --> 28:58.614
And now you're here with Jess.

28:58.697 --> 29:00.449
- And Paris.
- Jess, Rory!

29:00.532 --> 29:02.409
I swear, I didn't...

29:02.493 --> 29:04.661
- You didn't know he was coming over?
- I didn't.

29:04.745 --> 29:07.080
- You also didn't know he'd stay?
- It just happened.

29:07.164 --> 29:09.625
- How does that just happen?
- Well, he was...

29:09.958 --> 29:12.961
And the diner was... And I...

29:13.045 --> 29:15.005
And you what? Say something!

29:15.088 --> 29:17.591
- Stop yelling.
- You totally lied to me.

29:17.674 --> 29:19.718
- I didn't.
- Turn the situation around.

29:19.801 --> 29:21.553
- How's it looking?
- Complicated...

29:21.595 --> 29:23.639
- and I'm trying to explain it.
- That's crap.

29:23.722 --> 29:26.475
- It's my fault.
- What?

29:26.558 --> 29:28.936
It's my fault that Jess was here.

29:29.019 --> 29:32.022
I saw him in the diner
the day I came to Stars Hollow...

29:32.064 --> 29:34.608
and I thought he was cute,
and since I'm not great...

29:34.691 --> 29:38.070
at the 'batting the eyelashes,
look at my belly shirt' kind of thing...

29:38.111 --> 29:39.571
I asked Rory to help me.

29:39.613 --> 29:43.700
I thought if she could maybe get him
over here, we'd have a chance to talk...

29:43.742 --> 29:46.161
and I don't know.
It seems totally stupid now...

29:46.245 --> 29:50.123
and it obviously didn't work, shock,
but that's why he was here.

29:51.250 --> 29:53.460
- Thanks for trying to cover for me.
- That's okay.

29:53.544 --> 29:55.212
Anyway, I should get going.

29:55.254 --> 29:58.799
I'm probably gonna break out
in some sort of rash any second now.

30:04.763 --> 30:07.432
- So Paris likes Jess.
- Yeah.

30:10.602 --> 30:12.062
Rory, is this true?

30:13.230 --> 30:15.440
- Yes, it is.
- Paris and Jess?

30:15.524 --> 30:18.402
I know. There's no explaining attraction.

30:19.319 --> 30:21.113
Dean, listen to me.

30:21.530 --> 30:25.576
If I was going to have anyone over tonight,
it definitely would have been you.

30:25.617 --> 30:27.244
- Okay.
- Really?

30:27.578 --> 30:31.290
If you say so,
then I have to believe it, don't I?

30:31.790 --> 30:34.251
- Yes.
- Okay, then.

30:35.169 --> 30:36.753
Sorry that I yelled.

30:36.795 --> 30:39.464
Completely justified
under the circumstances.

30:40.174 --> 30:42.551
- I gotta get going.
- No, wait.

30:42.634 --> 30:45.220
Don't you wanna stay for ice cream?
We could hang out.

30:45.304 --> 30:48.390
- No, I'm just gonna go.
- I'm still seeing you tomorrow, right?

30:48.473 --> 30:49.850
Yeah, sure.

30:59.359 --> 31:00.944
See you tomorrow.

31:11.788 --> 31:13.415
- What was that?
- What?

31:13.499 --> 31:15.792
That. The story. The save.

31:15.834 --> 31:17.461
You helped me. Why would you do that?

31:17.544 --> 31:19.046
I don't know. It just came out.

31:19.129 --> 31:21.632
- You have no idea what you did.
- It was no big deal.

31:21.715 --> 31:24.801
No, it was a very big deal.
It was a huge deal.

31:25.260 --> 31:29.181
You helped me tonight
when you didn't want to, so I owed you.

31:29.223 --> 31:31.350
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

31:32.100 --> 31:35.020
Okay, I'll let you get back
to your alone night.

31:35.562 --> 31:36.980
You should stay.

31:37.814 --> 31:38.982
- Stay?
- Yeah.

31:39.024 --> 31:41.068
We could hang out,
maybe watch some TV.

31:41.151 --> 31:43.862
You can spend the night
if you don't want to drive back.

31:43.904 --> 31:46.698
- Spend the night? Like a slumber party?
- Sort of.

31:46.740 --> 31:49.243
You're doing this
'cause I lied to Dean for you, right?

31:49.326 --> 31:52.037
I'm doing this because
it's what you do with friends.

31:52.079 --> 31:53.372
We're friends?

31:53.413 --> 31:56.416
I'm not sure if there's an exact definition
for what we are...

31:56.500 --> 32:00.420
but I do think it falls somewhere
in the bizarro friends-ish realm.

32:00.712 --> 32:02.840
- Come on, stay.
- Okay.

32:03.799 --> 32:07.219
But if you're doing all this
so you can freeze my bra, I'll kill you.

32:07.302 --> 32:08.470
Duly noted.

32:10.764 --> 32:13.100
This is either the greatest steak
I've ever eaten...

32:13.183 --> 32:14.560
or I'm so hungry, I'm delirious.

32:14.643 --> 32:16.395
Pass the horseradish, please.

32:16.478 --> 32:18.397
I never knew you were a spicy girl.

32:18.438 --> 32:20.190
Believe me, I can handle my heat.

32:20.232 --> 32:22.025
One summer when we were first married...

32:22.067 --> 32:24.570
your father and I stayed
in this village in Thailand...

32:24.611 --> 32:27.489
where we spent two weeks
eating viciously hot chilies...

32:27.573 --> 32:28.949
- and skinny-dipping.
- Stop, Mom.

32:29.032 --> 32:31.493
You couldn't put your clothes on
after eating those.

32:31.577 --> 32:34.371
Stop it! I like to think of parents
the old-fashioned way.

32:34.413 --> 32:35.622
In separate bedrooms.

32:35.706 --> 32:39.168
And now it's time for my favorite part
of the evening:

32:39.376 --> 32:42.504
Our salute to the Chairman of the Board.

32:42.588 --> 32:44.965
I sure hope that's not B-O-R-E-D.

32:54.558 --> 32:55.976
- Mom?
- Yes?

32:56.894 --> 32:58.854
Remember the man
who wasn't staring at you?

32:58.937 --> 33:00.063
He wasn't staring at me.

33:00.105 --> 33:02.441
- Okay. Well, he's coming over.
- What?

33:02.941 --> 33:04.943
Excuse me. I hope I'm not interrupting.

33:05.027 --> 33:08.780
I couldn't help but notice that you two
are having more fun than anyone here.

33:08.822 --> 33:10.741
- That's true. We are.
- Well, good.

33:10.782 --> 33:13.744
I've come to the right place. Hi, I'm Chad.

33:13.785 --> 33:17.164
Hi, Chad. I'm Lorelai.
This is my mother, Emily.

33:17.289 --> 33:18.373
Your mother?

33:18.457 --> 33:21.919
If your next words are,
'You can't possibly be old enough...

33:22.002 --> 33:25.088
'to be her mother,'
I'll have to cause you severe physical pain.

33:25.130 --> 33:29.134
Emily, do you share
this rather extreme opinion?

33:29.384 --> 33:30.928
I think I'll stay out of it.

33:31.011 --> 33:34.598
In that case, let me just say
that I think you look more like sisters...

33:34.640 --> 33:37.184
than mother and daughter.
I went for a variation.

33:37.267 --> 33:39.061
I'll let it slide this time.

33:39.144 --> 33:41.980
- You two local or just visiting?
- Visiting.

33:42.022 --> 33:45.651
- Mom's from Hartford, and I'm from...
- Hartford? Great town.

33:46.485 --> 33:48.862
Little of the old, little of the new.

33:48.946 --> 33:51.114
- You like living there?
- Yes, I do.

33:51.156 --> 33:53.659
- And how about you? Where do you live?
- Here.

33:53.742 --> 33:56.370
By here, I mean this very bar stool.

33:56.745 --> 33:59.665
Admitting right off the bat
that you spend your life in a bar.

33:59.748 --> 34:02.042
Do you find that people
are impressed by that?

34:02.125 --> 34:03.627
Until now.

34:04.002 --> 34:05.712
I love this song.

34:06.004 --> 34:08.924
- It's a great song for dancing.
- Yes, it is.

34:10.175 --> 34:13.512
- Help me out here, will you?
- I think he's asking you to dance.

34:13.594 --> 34:16.514
What? No, I couldn't.

34:16.598 --> 34:18.809
Rumor has it you love this song.

34:18.851 --> 34:21.478
Yes, but I don't dance.

34:21.520 --> 34:23.021
Come on, I can't believe that.

34:23.105 --> 34:25.357
- I shouldn't leave my daughter alone.
- That's okay.

34:25.440 --> 34:26.650
The sitter will be here soon.

34:26.692 --> 34:28.652
I'm serious. You should ask someone else.

34:28.694 --> 34:29.902
Is it my dancing?

34:29.987 --> 34:32.447
Because you two can work out
some 'save me' signal...

34:32.531 --> 34:34.158
in case I really embarrass you.

34:34.241 --> 34:35.826
Go ahead, Mom. It'll be fun.

34:35.868 --> 34:38.161
Come on, the song's almost over.

34:38.203 --> 34:40.831
You'll hardly have to spend
any time at all with me.

34:41.748 --> 34:43.083
All right.

35:06.940 --> 35:10.486
- Your mom looks good out there.
- Yeah, she sure does.

35:50.609 --> 35:52.277
I'm sorry, I have to go.

35:53.445 --> 35:54.571
Mom?

35:58.450 --> 36:01.078
- Mom, what's wrong?
- We're leaving.

36:01.119 --> 36:03.038
- What happened?
- I shouldn't be doing this.

36:03.121 --> 36:05.666
- Doing what?
- Fraternizing with other men.

36:05.749 --> 36:08.919
- What are you talking about?
- I practically cheated on your father.

36:08.961 --> 36:11.713
- You did not cheat on Dad.
- I danced with another man.

36:11.797 --> 36:13.340
You've danced with other men before.

36:13.423 --> 36:15.509
Not like that,
not without your father present.

36:15.592 --> 36:17.636
It was just a dance. You were having fun.

36:17.719 --> 36:20.013
I need to go. How hard is it to find a coat?

36:20.097 --> 36:21.974
Mom, you didn't do anything wrong.

36:22.057 --> 36:25.936
I don't know why I let you take me to
this chophouse. I don't go to chophouses.

36:25.978 --> 36:28.021
- What were you thinking?
- Need food now?

36:28.105 --> 36:30.399
I certainly don't eat at bars.
Hookers eat at bars.

36:30.482 --> 36:32.776
- Only if they can't get a table.
- You're not funny.

36:32.818 --> 36:35.612
You knew this made me uncomfortable
and yet you kept pushing.

36:35.654 --> 36:37.656
I was trying to do everything right.

36:37.698 --> 36:40.325
You manipulated me into taking this trip
and still I came.

36:40.409 --> 36:43.328
You told me I was acting like a teenager
so I tried to be nicer.

36:43.370 --> 36:45.539
You said you needed to eat
so I made that happen.

36:45.622 --> 36:47.833
By sitting me at a bar
where you forced me...

36:47.916 --> 36:49.710
to engage in inappropriate behavior.

36:49.793 --> 36:51.962
- What?
- You let me get 60-40'd.

36:52.004 --> 36:54.590
You are crazy. Do you know that?

36:55.007 --> 36:58.635
We were having dinner, Mom,
a nice dinner. We were talking.

36:58.719 --> 37:00.220
Hell, we were having fun.

37:00.304 --> 37:02.806
Watching your mother
make an ass of herself is fun.

37:02.848 --> 37:05.851
You don't have any right
to complain about this relationship...

37:05.893 --> 37:09.396
if you don't wanna let your guard down
once in a while and just be normal.

37:09.479 --> 37:12.191
There's a way for a mother to behave
with her daughter.

37:12.232 --> 37:15.194
I'm sorry if you don't like it,
but that's how it is.

37:32.544 --> 37:33.795
Come in.

37:35.214 --> 37:38.550
I called the bellman to get the bags.
He said it would be 10 minutes.

37:38.592 --> 37:41.470
- Thank you for agreeing to leave early.
- No problem.

37:41.553 --> 37:43.722
I guess this whole thing
was a silly idea anyway.

37:43.805 --> 37:45.057
I don't know why I pushed it.

37:45.098 --> 37:46.934
We can't even have dinner without a fight.

37:47.017 --> 37:49.436
What was I thinking,
putting us together for a weekend?

37:49.520 --> 37:50.896
It was a nice thought, Mom.

37:50.979 --> 37:53.398
I guess it's the thought that counts,
isn't it?

37:53.440 --> 37:56.401
You know, if you want,
I can just bring our bags down.

37:56.443 --> 37:58.737
They're not that heavy.
Then we don't have to wait.

37:58.821 --> 38:00.739
Well, that sounds fine.

38:03.367 --> 38:06.119
Why can't we have
what you and Rory have?

38:08.080 --> 38:10.582
- Rory and I are different.
- We're mother and daughter.

38:10.624 --> 38:13.043
You're mother and daughter.
It shouldn't be different.

38:13.085 --> 38:15.712
It's completely different.
It couldn't be more different.

38:15.754 --> 38:17.005
But why?

38:17.256 --> 38:20.509
I grew up in a different environment.

38:20.759 --> 38:24.221
- You mean an oppressive environment.
- No, I mean a different environment.

38:24.304 --> 38:26.598
And plus, I was so young when I had Rory.

38:26.682 --> 38:29.017
So because I waited
until I was grown and married...

38:29.101 --> 38:31.019
I can't have a relationship
with my daughter.

38:31.103 --> 38:33.063
- No.
- Well, then, why?

38:38.026 --> 38:40.362
Rory and I are best friends, Mom.

38:41.822 --> 38:44.950
We are best friends first
and mother and daughter second.

38:45.033 --> 38:47.953
And you and I are
mother and daughter always.

38:47.995 --> 38:50.330
I wasn't taught to be best friends
with my daughter.

38:50.414 --> 38:51.415
I know.

38:51.498 --> 38:53.917
I was taught to be a role model
for my daughter.

38:53.959 --> 38:55.169
I know that, too.

38:55.252 --> 38:58.255
I did what I thought was right,
what I had to do to protect you.

38:58.297 --> 39:00.174
Because of this, we have no relationship.

39:00.257 --> 39:03.010
- Mom, we have a relationship.
- We do?

39:03.093 --> 39:05.304
What? What is our relationship?

39:06.805 --> 39:09.474
- Well, we...
- Exactly.

39:12.102 --> 39:15.606
Maybe an intense weekend together
was not the best idea for us.

39:15.647 --> 39:19.526
Maybe we need to start
with something simpler.

39:19.860 --> 39:22.988
- Like what? A brisk walk around the block?
- No, I hate exercise.

39:23.071 --> 39:25.616
- Well, as long as you find this amusing.
- Mom.

39:25.699 --> 39:28.952
Come on, there has to be something else.

39:30.037 --> 39:33.415
- Something small.
- Like what?

39:39.463 --> 39:41.840
Where are you going?
Lorelai, come back here.

39:41.882 --> 39:45.052
You don't just walk out on a person.
That's rude.

39:45.552 --> 39:48.347
- That's a robe.
- Yes. This is my robe.

39:48.555 --> 39:51.642
And I want you to go into your room
and get your robe.

39:51.683 --> 39:53.769
And then, exactly at the same time...

39:53.852 --> 39:56.271
we're gonna shove these robes
in our suitcases...

39:56.355 --> 39:58.857
and we're gonna walk out that door
and leave with them.

39:58.941 --> 40:00.567
- That's stealing.
- Yes, it is.

40:00.651 --> 40:03.111
You want me to steal?
That's how we're going to bond?

40:03.195 --> 40:06.698
You love this robe. You've talked
about this robe since we got here.

40:06.782 --> 40:09.409
So this robe will be symbolic
of our trip together.

40:09.493 --> 40:12.538
Soon as they check the room,
they'll know the robes are gone.

40:12.621 --> 40:15.415
- Then they'll charge our credit card.
- How do you know?

40:15.499 --> 40:17.668
Because that's what the tag
on the hanger says.

40:17.709 --> 40:22.214
The little tag on the hanger could be right,
or the little tag could just be there...

40:22.297 --> 40:24.424
trying to scare us away from trying.

40:24.508 --> 40:26.844
Either way,
whether we get away with it or not...

40:26.885 --> 40:29.429
it's something we did. You and I.

40:29.680 --> 40:31.181
You're serious.

40:32.558 --> 40:35.602
- I'm folding this robe up.
- Lorelai.

40:35.686 --> 40:39.189
- I'm putting this robe in my bag.
- That's lunacy.

40:39.273 --> 40:41.900
I am zipping up the bag
that contains the robe.

40:41.984 --> 40:45.612
- I have a perfectly good robe at home.
- The only question is...

40:45.696 --> 40:47.489
am I doing it alone?

40:48.323 --> 40:50.284
Did you ever steal a robe with Rory?

40:50.367 --> 40:53.871
No, Rory would never steal.
She's far too moral for that.

40:53.912 --> 40:56.415
You, however, vicious trollop...

40:57.332 --> 40:59.084
what's it gonna be?

41:00.169 --> 41:01.545
I should have my head examined.

41:01.587 --> 41:03.463
We'll make an appointment
when we get back.

41:03.547 --> 41:05.382
You do know in the course of one night...

41:05.424 --> 41:08.093
you've turned me
into an adulterer and a thief.

41:08.177 --> 41:10.262
I'll have you working
at the Chicken Ranch soon.

41:10.345 --> 41:12.681
I cannot believe I'm doing this.

41:24.485 --> 41:26.445
You actually got Grandma
to steal a bathrobe?

41:26.528 --> 41:29.573
I did catch her trying to return it
while I was getting the car.

41:29.615 --> 41:30.657
- Still.
- I know.

41:30.741 --> 41:33.619
Life with my mother:
One step forward, 5,000 steps back.

41:33.702 --> 41:35.621
It's kind of like the spastic polka.

41:35.704 --> 41:38.123
- Excuse me. Are you done?
- No, sorry, not yet.

41:38.207 --> 41:41.543
You're gonna eat half a piece of bacon
that's been there for 10 minutes?

41:41.627 --> 41:43.837
You must be
if you're saying you're not done.

41:43.921 --> 41:46.715
Because that's the only thing left.
Unless you eat plates.

41:46.798 --> 41:48.634
- Go away.
- You're hogging the table.

41:48.717 --> 41:50.969
- If you keep it up, I'm ordering seconds.
- Fine.

41:51.053 --> 41:53.013
Paris looked a little green this morning.

41:53.096 --> 41:55.891
She had a sugar-carb hangover
of monumental proportions.

41:55.974 --> 41:59.728
People don't realize it, but it takes
years of training to eat the way we do.

41:59.811 --> 42:02.314
- Don't I know it.
- So what's on the agenda for today?

42:02.397 --> 42:05.567
Dean, Dean, and...
Oh, did I mention Dean?

42:05.651 --> 42:07.653
Wow, he must have been
crazy mad last night.

42:07.736 --> 42:09.571
I'd say that was a fair assessment.

42:09.655 --> 42:11.156
I gotta get to the Inn.

42:11.240 --> 42:14.034
Okay. I'm probably
gonna have dinner with Dean, so...

42:14.117 --> 42:17.204
I'll have the house to myself tonight.
Life's funny, isn't it?

42:17.287 --> 42:20.290
I simply cannot stop laughing.
I'll get the check.

42:20.332 --> 42:21.583
Thanks, hon.

42:23.502 --> 42:25.838
- Hey, Luke.
- What, you find a nail in your food?

42:25.921 --> 42:29.091
I swear to God, Tom, you are dead.
You hear me? Dead!

42:29.174 --> 42:31.343
There's nothing wrong
with the food, Luke.

42:31.426 --> 42:32.469
Sorry, Tom.

42:32.511 --> 42:34.471
- I just wanted to thank you.
- For what?

42:34.513 --> 42:37.599
- The care package. That was sweet of you.
- What care package?

42:37.683 --> 42:40.018
Luke, I think they hit the water line again.

42:40.060 --> 42:43.021
What? Tom, you are dead.
You hear me? Dead!

42:45.649 --> 42:47.484
- Interesting.
- You wanna pay?

42:47.526 --> 42:50.070
I don't think Luke knew
about the food last night.

42:50.154 --> 42:51.738
That'll be $12.50.

42:51.822 --> 42:53.198
You lied about why you came over.

42:53.282 --> 42:55.617
I don't have any quarters.
I'll have to give nickels.

42:55.701 --> 42:58.162
Why would you lie
about something like that?

42:58.203 --> 43:00.330
Here's your change. Come again soon.

43:00.372 --> 43:02.499
- You wanted to come.
- I have to get back to work.

43:02.541 --> 43:05.586
You're squirming. I've never
seen you squirm. It's entertaining.

43:05.669 --> 43:07.254
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

43:12.885 --> 43:15.929
Rory's just inside paying.
She's coming out to meet you after.

43:16.013 --> 43:19.016
- We're gonna spend the day together.
- That's great.

43:19.057 --> 43:20.517
Yeah, it is.

43:21.685 --> 43:24.897
So, listen, Rory told me everything
that happened last night.

43:24.980 --> 43:27.858
- She feels just terrible about it.
- I know.

43:27.900 --> 43:29.318
Good. You should.

43:29.568 --> 43:33.405
'Cause it's just one of those freaky,
unfortunate things that happens.

43:33.739 --> 43:35.949
Freaky and unfortunate. Yeah.

43:36.074 --> 43:38.994
She had nothing to do
with Jess coming over, believe me.

43:39.077 --> 43:42.080
- She did not want him there.
- That's what she told me.

43:43.415 --> 43:45.375
Rory wouldn't lie, right?

43:46.585 --> 43:48.795
No, Rory wouldn't lie.

44:33.298 --> 44:34.299
English
