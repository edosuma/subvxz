00:01.958 --> 00:02.836
[gasping]

00:02.838 --> 00:04.259
[Mr. Clare] You let her
go out with a man!

00:04.261 --> 00:06.495
- [grunts] What have you done?
- Stop it!

00:06.497 --> 00:08.096
Did you enjoy your evening?

00:08.098 --> 00:09.898
- [Lily crying]
- [Mr. Clare grunting]

00:11.000 --> 00:13.968
Never again...
will I kneel to any man.

00:13.970 --> 00:16.470
Now they shall kneel to me.

00:16.472 --> 00:18.173
[snarling]

00:18.175 --> 00:21.475
Is it a blessing, the purpose
of which we cannot yet see?

00:21.477 --> 00:25.746
I know you, my friend,
Ethan Chandler.

00:25.748 --> 00:27.415
What can I do for you,
Inspector?

00:27.417 --> 00:29.717
You know him.
American. 6'3", I would say.

00:29.719 --> 00:30.951
It means nothing.

00:30.953 --> 00:32.320
You're sure
you don't recognize him?

00:32.322 --> 00:33.588
Entirely sure.

00:33.590 --> 00:35.623
I'm expanding
down here in the cellar

00:35.625 --> 00:37.625
- for a new attraction.
- More crime scenes?

00:37.627 --> 00:39.427
Something much more ingenious.

00:39.429 --> 00:40.761
Hello, old pal.

00:40.763 --> 00:42.662
I'm not going back to America.

00:42.664 --> 00:43.764
You are.

00:43.766 --> 00:46.066
I see you
outside of this house...

00:46.068 --> 00:47.367
and I'll kill ya.

00:47.369 --> 00:50.037
While I'm gone,
do be mindful of Sir Malcolm.

00:50.039 --> 00:52.106
And if he needs me,
don't hesitate.

00:52.108 --> 00:54.274
[Madame Kali] <i>He released</i>
<i>himself from the enchantment.</i>

00:54.276 --> 00:56.076
[Hecate]
<i>You lost your power over him?</i>

00:56.078 --> 00:57.644
Perhaps you're
not as desirable

00:57.646 --> 00:58.712
as you thought, Mother.

00:58.714 --> 01:01.748
- You grow impertinent.
- You grow old.

01:01.750 --> 01:03.350
- [Madame Kali growling]
- [gasps]

01:03.352 --> 01:05.218
[Madame Kali] <i>Now</i>
<i>Sir Malcolm is himself again</i>

01:05.220 --> 01:07.053
<i>and so he will come.</i>

01:07.055 --> 01:08.255
Sir Malcolm has gone.

01:08.257 --> 01:10.290
We need to find Miss Ives
and Mr. Chandler.

01:10.292 --> 01:12.058
If you will let
Miss Ives live,

01:12.060 --> 01:14.894
I will walk with you
to the end of time.

01:14.896 --> 01:15.995
It's the one thing
I cannot do.

01:15.997 --> 01:17.429
The Master will have her.

01:17.431 --> 01:19.298
I leave you
with a few memories.

01:19.300 --> 01:21.067
Mind them.
They sting too.

01:53.400 --> 01:55.500
Easy, boy.

02:05.444 --> 02:07.445
I have taken
the sensible precaution

02:07.447 --> 02:10.348
of tossing
your firearms outside.

02:10.350 --> 02:13.818
Through the same little window
wherein I gained entrance.

02:14.953 --> 02:17.755
There are times
one's diminutive size

02:17.757 --> 02:20.024
bears strange fruit.

02:25.530 --> 02:27.231
Miss Ives!

02:27.233 --> 02:29.200
- Come down here.
- Leave her out of this.

02:29.202 --> 02:31.202
Oh, pshaw.

02:32.971 --> 02:35.872
Mmm. That's it, honey.

02:38.209 --> 02:40.410
Come join the merriment.

02:45.550 --> 02:46.817
[Ethan] How'd you find us?

02:46.819 --> 02:49.953
Not too hard tracking down
a six-foot American

02:51.322 --> 02:55.258
traveling with a raven-haired
beauty such as this.

02:55.260 --> 02:57.593
Took me some time, but, well,

02:57.595 --> 02:59.929
you know my persistence,
old friend.

03:03.734 --> 03:05.468
Did you think
you could hide from me?

03:06.670 --> 03:08.137
Let her go.

03:08.139 --> 03:09.672
[snickering]

03:10.774 --> 03:13.509
You are a repellent creature.

03:13.511 --> 03:15.344
You don't know the half of it.

03:18.749 --> 03:20.683
Hope you don't mind.
[sighs]

03:21.985 --> 03:24.119
Gets awful uncomfortable.

03:33.696 --> 03:37.299
This is what
your boyfriend did, honey.

03:37.301 --> 03:42.003
When he was in one of his
more obstreperous moods.

03:44.740 --> 03:46.708
[chain rattling]

03:47.943 --> 03:49.444
Put these on him.

04:00.022 --> 04:01.188
No...

04:02.590 --> 04:04.425
behind his back.

04:12.234 --> 04:13.634
[gun cocks]

04:13.636 --> 04:16.303
Now we have
a curious dilemma, do we not?

04:17.605 --> 04:19.440
Mr. Chandler
shall be returning

04:19.442 --> 04:20.574
to his home country
with me.

04:22.209 --> 04:25.579
But what shall we do
with Miss Ives?

04:25.581 --> 04:28.081
What shall we do
with all that pretty hair?

04:28.083 --> 04:29.550
You lay a finger on her
and I'll...

04:30.652 --> 04:32.319
You'll do what?

04:32.321 --> 04:33.786
[breathing heavily]

04:36.723 --> 04:38.491
The only real question is...

04:39.927 --> 04:44.164
do I scalp her
before or after I fuck her?

04:48.635 --> 04:50.002
- [screams]
- [Vanessa grunts]

04:50.004 --> 04:51.103

[both grunting]

05:04.517 --> 05:05.784

we are homicides together.

07:29.492 --> 07:31.559
It was him or us.

07:31.561 --> 07:33.094
And that excuses everything?

07:33.096 --> 07:34.361
I don't know.

07:36.464 --> 07:38.132
You did that to his face?

07:41.202 --> 07:42.670
Yes.

07:44.405 --> 07:45.405
What are you?

07:48.977 --> 07:50.544
[horses whinnying]

07:52.647 --> 07:53.913
Come on.

[gun cocks]

08:17.571 --> 08:19.405
You must come.

08:19.407 --> 08:20.674
Sir Malcolm's in trouble.

08:31.818 --> 08:35.488
It was a kind of enchantment
or bedevilment.

08:35.490 --> 08:37.456
It shattered him rather,
breaking free of it.

08:38.558 --> 08:40.258
And then he disappeared.

08:40.260 --> 08:41.493
[Ethan] Was he taken?

08:41.495 --> 08:43.162
[Frankenstein]
Mr. Lyle doesn't think so.

08:43.164 --> 08:44.296
And where has he gone?

08:45.398 --> 08:47.265
Into the Witch's castle.

08:56.209 --> 08:57.676
[Peter] <i>Did you imagine it?</i>

08:57.678 --> 09:01.145
When you came across
my emaciated corpse,

09:01.147 --> 09:03.781
crawling with
the creatures of the earth,

09:03.783 --> 09:06.451
flesh eaten hollow.

09:06.453 --> 09:08.353
Did you imagine my slow death?

09:08.355 --> 09:11.423
Feeling the bugs
crawling over my face?

09:11.425 --> 09:12.824
Oh, Peter,

09:12.826 --> 09:15.526
my outrage takes
pride of place.

09:15.528 --> 09:17.795
Our father left you to die
from neglect

09:17.797 --> 09:20.198
and his lust for glory...

09:20.200 --> 09:21.498
but with me,
he actually

09:21.500 --> 09:23.434
looked into my eyes
and pulled the trigger.

09:23.436 --> 09:26.971
With my arms outstretched,
defenseless before you.

09:26.973 --> 09:28.572
Not many men
can claim

09:28.574 --> 09:29.973
to have killed
all their children.

09:29.975 --> 09:32.276
- You're not real.
- [laughing]

09:32.278 --> 09:33.344
You are not here!

09:33.346 --> 09:35.078
[Mina] We're here
as long as you are.

09:35.080 --> 09:37.348
[Peter] Do you think
you can forget us?

09:37.350 --> 09:38.582
I have faced down
graver threats

09:38.584 --> 09:40.451
than those conjured
from my memory!

09:40.453 --> 09:42.386
Oh, well said, Malcolm.

09:43.555 --> 09:45.188
How like you.

09:58.169 --> 09:59.803
Kiss me, darling.

10:01.639 --> 10:03.139
Like you did in the old days.

10:09.680 --> 10:11.781
- [gasps]
- [Gladys laughing]

10:17.288 --> 10:18.720
[Sir Malcolm] No!

10:19.823 --> 10:21.523
[screaming]

10:28.999 --> 10:30.332
[breathing deeply]

10:35.471 --> 10:37.439
[Hecate]
Mother, you look tired.

10:39.041 --> 10:41.443
It's a temporary situation,
I assure you.

10:42.545 --> 10:43.878
Mmm.

10:43.880 --> 10:45.280
She's on her way.

10:47.550 --> 10:48.617
I can feel her.

10:49.719 --> 10:50.852
And then...

10:51.954 --> 10:53.487
all will be well.

10:55.257 --> 10:56.590
And you're confident

10:56.592 --> 10:58.226
you can deliver her
to the Master?

11:03.132 --> 11:05.633
What are you about, Hecate?

11:05.635 --> 11:08.869
Enjoying your terror,
if I'm honest.

11:10.339 --> 11:13.574
What if you fail?

11:13.576 --> 11:16.811
What if Miss Ives should prove
stronger than you think?

11:18.179 --> 11:20.214
What would the Master
do to you then?

11:20.216 --> 11:21.281
Caution, daughter.

11:21.283 --> 11:23.317
Children should walk
before they run.

11:23.319 --> 11:24.584
And mothers should know
when their children

11:24.586 --> 11:26.019
are ready to run.

11:26.021 --> 11:27.087
You believe you are?

11:27.089 --> 11:29.089
I believe what you have
taught me.

11:29.091 --> 11:31.725
That youth is paramount,

11:31.727 --> 11:34.061
that the sinuous agility of
the young mind and body

11:34.063 --> 11:37.030
will always triumph
over the ravages of age,

11:37.032 --> 11:39.466
the slowness of decrepitude.

11:39.468 --> 11:41.434
I believe the dinosaurs
should know

11:41.436 --> 11:42.669
when the mammal is hunting.

11:57.885 --> 12:00.753
If I were of
another constitution,

12:02.555 --> 12:04.123
I would fear you.

12:06.760 --> 12:09.996
You know I obey you
in all things, Mother.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.765
For how long?

12:14.667 --> 12:16.268
How long did
the dinosaurs last

12:16.270 --> 12:18.236
before the mammals
discovered their claws...

12:20.774 --> 12:21.940
darling?

12:26.045 --> 12:29.347
- Where are you going?
- I've a social call to make.

12:29.349 --> 12:32.384
Don't worry, I'll be back
for the festivities.

13:11.990 --> 13:13.123
[Ethan] What's going on?

13:13.125 --> 13:14.691
There've been policemen about.

13:14.693 --> 13:16.360
I don't know why.

13:16.362 --> 13:17.727
Comforting to
have them here though.

13:17.729 --> 13:19.063
Mr. Chandler.

13:22.667 --> 13:23.667
Inspector.

13:24.836 --> 13:27.170
- Might I have a word?
- Shall we walk?

13:27.172 --> 13:30.073
Well, mightn't we be
more comfortable inside?

13:30.075 --> 13:31.174
No.

13:32.343 --> 13:34.478
Ma'am. Sir.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.412
My name is
Inspector Bartholomew Rusk.

13:36.414 --> 13:37.913
And you are?

13:37.915 --> 13:39.115
This way.

13:45.722 --> 13:46.856
Why all the police?

13:46.858 --> 13:48.024
Sir Malcolm reports

13:48.026 --> 13:49.425
there has been thievery
in the neighborhood,

13:49.427 --> 13:51.260
although our records
don't support the claim.

13:51.262 --> 13:54.563
But Westminster
must be protected.

13:54.565 --> 13:56.131
You don't give up.

13:56.133 --> 13:57.432
That I do not.

13:59.636 --> 14:01.470
So, this is where you live?

14:01.472 --> 14:03.105
Is it?

14:03.107 --> 14:05.007
Disguise it as you might try,

14:05.009 --> 14:07.510
Sir Malcolm
recognized your picture.

14:07.512 --> 14:10.212
Perhaps he's just a fan
from my theatrical days.

14:10.214 --> 14:12.481
Do you know
the medical neurosis called

14:12.483 --> 14:13.915
the phantom limb?

14:15.184 --> 14:16.885
It's not uncommon
when people lose

14:16.887 --> 14:18.653
an arm or a leg or such.

14:19.722 --> 14:20.889
When I lost my arm,

14:20.891 --> 14:24.059
I was constantly reaching
for things with it.

14:24.061 --> 14:25.360
It seemed so real...

14:26.461 --> 14:28.262
but it wasn't.

14:28.264 --> 14:30.565
More and more,
I think this is all some...

14:31.667 --> 14:33.401
sort of phantom limb.

14:35.203 --> 14:36.437
Something is going on here

14:36.439 --> 14:38.406
which is not an actual
arm or leg.

14:39.642 --> 14:40.708
Something not quite real...

14:41.810 --> 14:43.244
but completely true.

14:44.513 --> 14:45.879
You mean otherworldly?

14:45.881 --> 14:47.181
That's precisely what I mean.

14:47.183 --> 14:49.283
I couldn't codify it
in a report log,

14:49.285 --> 14:52.019
nor could I capture it
in a crime scene photograph.

14:53.121 --> 14:54.788
This place, those people

14:55.890 --> 14:57.091
and you...

14:59.360 --> 15:01.361
are a phantom limb.

15:03.898 --> 15:04.898
Are you a superstitious man?

15:06.000 --> 15:07.200
Not by nature.

15:08.469 --> 15:09.870
But I'm learning to be.

15:11.405 --> 15:14.274
And the things I have seen
over the years, Mr. Chandler,

15:14.276 --> 15:16.376
have made me a bit mad,
I think.

15:17.478 --> 15:20.213
Set a thief to catch a thief.

15:20.215 --> 15:22.482
And set a monster
to catch a monster?

15:22.484 --> 15:23.816
Very like.

15:23.818 --> 15:25.418
My less monstrous colleagues

15:25.420 --> 15:28.188
will be on duty night and day,
you can be assured.

15:28.190 --> 15:30.590
You will not take
one step from this house

15:30.592 --> 15:31.824
when you will not be observed.

15:31.826 --> 15:34.026
Your peace of mind,
such as it is,

15:34.028 --> 15:35.527
will cease to exist

15:35.529 --> 15:37.630
and a length of hemp
will seem a cheap price

15:37.632 --> 15:39.131
to be free of the burden.

15:42.268 --> 15:43.803
I'm sure you're right.

15:43.805 --> 15:45.270
Now if you'll excuse me?

15:46.539 --> 15:48.007
Of course.

15:48.009 --> 15:49.608
Good evening, Inspector.

15:49.610 --> 15:50.642
Good evening, Mr. Talbot.

15:55.281 --> 16:00.519
Yes. I have penetrated
your fanciful stage name.

16:00.521 --> 16:03.122
Ethan Lawrence Talbot.

16:03.124 --> 16:06.290
Born the year of our Lord 1857
in the New Mexico Territory,

16:06.292 --> 16:07.826
enlisted in
the United States Cavalry

16:07.828 --> 16:10.662
March the 2nd, 1882.

16:11.764 --> 16:13.397
Your complete
War Department dossier

16:13.399 --> 16:14.699
is currently being
ferreted out

16:14.701 --> 16:15.934
from thick ledgers

16:15.936 --> 16:17.869
in various departmental
agencies in Washington.

16:17.871 --> 16:19.437
When it arrives,
I'm sure it'll make

16:19.439 --> 16:21.339
fascinating reading.

16:21.341 --> 16:23.241
Really...

16:23.243 --> 16:25.576
you would do well
to make a clean breast of it.

16:26.678 --> 16:28.646
The quarry has been
run to his hole.

16:28.648 --> 16:32.350
He has lost his anonymity
and his freedom of movement.

16:32.352 --> 16:34.385
He should know
when he is captured.

16:36.288 --> 16:38.255
Cornered animals
are the most dangerous.

16:38.257 --> 16:40.658
But they are cornered,
nonetheless.

16:44.696 --> 16:46.030
Not until there's evidence

16:46.032 --> 16:47.531
that will stand up
in court of law.

16:48.633 --> 16:50.433
True enough.

16:50.435 --> 16:52.636
But I'm about it,
you can be sure.

16:54.672 --> 16:57.140
Enjoy your evening, Ethan.

16:57.142 --> 16:59.909
I stand at the ready
to be of assistance

16:59.911 --> 17:02.011
and liberate you
from your burdens,

17:02.013 --> 17:04.012
one way or another.

17:09.752 --> 17:10.853
[door locking]

17:13.857 --> 17:16.092
- [Ethan sighs]
- The moon is full tonight.

17:17.194 --> 17:18.327
I know.

17:19.563 --> 17:20.797
You'll help me again?

17:27.270 --> 17:28.904
Good evening, Mr. Chandler.

17:32.141 --> 17:33.509
Mr. Lyle.

17:33.511 --> 17:35.911
Mr. Lyle was explaining
his treachery to us.

17:37.480 --> 17:40.282
I don't for a moment
deny my...

17:40.284 --> 17:41.950
complicity with that
evil woman

17:41.952 --> 17:44.319
but you must believe me
when I say that's done

17:44.321 --> 17:47.288
and I am willing to suffer
the consequences

17:47.290 --> 17:48.890
of my disloyalty to her...

17:50.226 --> 17:52.527
which are ruinous.

17:52.529 --> 17:54.062
And now we're to trust you?

17:54.064 --> 17:56.397
I hope I've demonstrated
my allegiance

17:56.399 --> 17:58.066
to the people in this room.

18:00.402 --> 18:03.671
My shame is my own
to live with, and I shall.

18:03.673 --> 18:05.873
No one here
is above guilt, Mr. Lyle.

18:07.743 --> 18:09.510
We need every ally
for the night ahead.

18:10.613 --> 18:11.912
What do you mean?

18:11.914 --> 18:13.948
Sir Malcolm needs our help.
We will go to him.

18:13.950 --> 18:15.049
No.

18:16.452 --> 18:18.285
- Ethan, we have to help.
- [Ethan] No.

18:19.387 --> 18:21.122
We can't go tonight.

18:21.124 --> 18:22.990
- Or any night.
- He's right.

18:22.992 --> 18:25.592
Their power is multiplied
many times over by night.

18:25.594 --> 18:27.628
And, in any event,
Miss Ives,

18:27.630 --> 18:29.296
you cannot
go inside that house.

18:29.298 --> 18:30.664
Sir Malcolm needs me!

18:30.666 --> 18:32.199
There will be no discussion
on the point!

18:32.201 --> 18:33.467
That's exactly what she wants!

18:33.469 --> 18:36.503
I will not
let him suffer alone.

18:36.505 --> 18:38.037
[Ethan] Vanessa, listen.

18:38.039 --> 18:40.807
I understand you want to
help Sir Malcolm, and we will,

18:42.209 --> 18:43.810
but you know what those things
are capable of.

18:44.912 --> 18:46.112
And you, Mr. Chandler,

18:46.114 --> 18:48.315
know exactly
what I'm capable of.

18:49.417 --> 18:52.351
- [sighs]
- This is my work now,

18:52.353 --> 18:53.987
for it is not a battle
of firearms,

18:53.989 --> 18:55.789
it is a battle of faith.

18:55.791 --> 18:57.423
And yours
is not strong enough.

18:57.425 --> 19:00.794
There's no goddamn way
you're walking in there alone

19:00.796 --> 19:02.996
and certainly not at night.

19:02.998 --> 19:04.430
Mr. Chandler is right.

19:06.533 --> 19:07.966
[Sembene] We go tomorrow.

19:09.569 --> 19:12.405
In the day.
All of us.

19:14.040 --> 19:15.675
We save that man.

19:17.277 --> 19:20.513
We kill that woman
and all her like.

19:22.616 --> 19:25.184
It will be unholy slaughter.

19:31.724 --> 19:34.392
[boy yelling in distance]
Fresh flowers, fresh flowers,

19:34.394 --> 19:35.894
fresh flowers!

19:39.465 --> 19:41.199
[indistinct chatter]

19:44.069 --> 19:45.269
[woman 1] Look over there.

19:45.271 --> 19:47.071
[woman 2 exclaims in disgust]

20:13.164 --> 20:14.297
My dear Mr. Clare!

20:14.299 --> 20:16.900
You seem inordinately
contemplative.

20:18.436 --> 20:20.371
I suppose I am.

20:20.373 --> 20:24.575
Well, at least the citizenry's
enjoying my beasties now,

20:24.577 --> 20:27.745
although they prefer
my crimes, God love them.

20:27.747 --> 20:29.212
Congratulations.

20:29.214 --> 20:31.047
You seem to have a success.

20:31.049 --> 20:35.051
Which only emboldens me
for greater ballyhoos to come!

20:37.855 --> 20:39.622
Do you have
an especial favorite?

20:40.858 --> 20:42.092
What?

20:47.998 --> 20:49.231
They're all too ugly.

20:50.333 --> 20:52.167
Isn't that rather the point?

20:54.070 --> 20:55.237
It's not real.

20:58.008 --> 20:59.575
True evil is...

21:00.844 --> 21:02.978
above all things, seductive.

21:06.883 --> 21:08.117
When the Devil
knocks at your door,

21:08.119 --> 21:11.453
he doesn't have...
cloven hooves.

21:13.290 --> 21:14.489
He is beautiful

21:16.659 --> 21:18.294
and offers you
your heart's desire

21:18.296 --> 21:19.728
in whispered airs.

21:22.665 --> 21:23.965
Like a Siren,

21:25.367 --> 21:29.170
beckoning you to her
ruinous shore.

21:32.542 --> 21:33.608
And what do you do,

21:34.710 --> 21:36.411
when that Siren sings?

21:37.512 --> 21:39.280
[swallows]
You save your soul...

21:43.885 --> 21:45.453
or you give it to her.

21:46.855 --> 21:50.291
- But then you're damned.
- But you're not alone.

21:53.361 --> 21:55.996
Interestingly, I thought about
putting Pandora

21:55.998 --> 21:57.998
and her wicked box
in the exhibit.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.568
But in the end I didn't.

22:00.570 --> 22:03.337
I mean, how could you show
what the box contained?

22:04.439 --> 22:05.806
I could tell you.

22:10.078 --> 22:11.378
A mirror.

22:13.948 --> 22:15.349
Nothing but a mirror.

22:20.054 --> 22:21.788
What things you must do here.

22:22.890 --> 22:24.391
So much empty space

22:24.393 --> 22:28.661
to fill up with your...
adventures.

22:28.663 --> 22:29.829
But you like adventures.

22:30.931 --> 22:31.931
Who doesn't?

22:35.002 --> 22:37.203
You're a very
interesting man, Dorian.

22:38.672 --> 22:41.540
You can't be as pure
as your face suggests.

22:41.542 --> 22:42.808
And are you?

22:45.612 --> 22:49.081
As for the room,
I find diversions to fill it.

22:49.083 --> 22:51.450
I've held balls, as you know.

22:52.685 --> 22:56.688
And the occasional gathering
of like-minded friends.

22:58.157 --> 22:59.825
Photography sessions.

23:03.696 --> 23:05.296
What do you photograph?

23:07.500 --> 23:09.334
All manner of life.

23:11.971 --> 23:14.272
I've even held Theosophical
Society meetings here.

23:15.374 --> 23:16.741
What's that?

23:20.712 --> 23:22.213
A sort of religion,

23:23.549 --> 23:26.717
seeking a personal connection
to the divine truths,

23:27.819 --> 23:29.320
to that hidden knowledge.

23:29.322 --> 23:32.056
You must like hidden things,
for you hide things very well.

23:33.158 --> 23:34.625
As do you.

23:36.294 --> 23:37.562
I don't know what you mean.

23:37.564 --> 23:39.363
Don't you, Brona?

23:44.269 --> 23:46.070
Or is it Lily now?

23:48.540 --> 23:51.975
Or is it some divine
admixture of both?

23:51.977 --> 23:53.843
This room is made for secrets.

23:53.845 --> 23:55.612
Then tell me yours.

24:06.891 --> 24:08.058
In time.

24:09.193 --> 24:10.426
Tell me now.

24:17.301 --> 24:19.435
Now, boy.

24:22.806 --> 24:23.973
Kneel.

24:26.510 --> 24:29.278
Kneel, boy.

24:40.056 --> 24:41.724
Tell me your secrets

24:42.826 --> 24:44.559
and I'll tell you mine.

24:51.968 --> 24:54.302
I've been staying here

24:55.505 --> 24:58.873
and thought it best
that we sort all this out.

24:58.875 --> 25:01.409
You mean you haven't
seen your cousin?

25:04.913 --> 25:06.314
[sighs]

25:08.851 --> 25:09.951
You don't approve?

25:12.154 --> 25:15.923
I know the attraction of
narcotics on occasion but...

25:15.925 --> 25:17.191
Yes, yes, "But."

25:18.293 --> 25:19.593
Of course.

25:24.099 --> 25:25.366
[sighs]

25:25.368 --> 25:27.834
[inhales sharply]

25:27.836 --> 25:30.304
[exhales deeply]
Scientifically speaking,

25:31.706 --> 25:34.575
life's nothing but a series
of chemical reactions.

25:38.446 --> 25:43.216
So, to accelerate
or decelerate that process

25:44.318 --> 25:45.752
is of no great matter.

25:49.057 --> 25:51.291
It gives us
that illusion of power

25:53.260 --> 25:54.661
in a life with little,

25:56.064 --> 25:57.363
does it not?

26:00.634 --> 26:01.534
And, yes,

26:02.636 --> 26:04.337
it becomes an addiction,

26:05.472 --> 26:06.472
this...

26:08.108 --> 26:10.009
seeking transcendence.

26:11.612 --> 26:13.580
Much like
your addiction to God.

26:15.982 --> 26:17.216
[Frankenstein sighs]

26:21.188 --> 26:22.722
I'm sorry she hurt you.

26:31.131 --> 26:33.131
I'm sorry you feel so unloved.

26:36.869 --> 26:39.871
You are a beautiful monster.

26:39.873 --> 26:42.608
And there are those
who could love you...

26:42.610 --> 26:43.908
and shall.

26:54.186 --> 26:55.620
Life awaits you.

27:27.085 --> 27:30.087
- The cellar again?
- Yes.

27:32.690 --> 27:34.658
You should tell Miss Ives.

27:34.660 --> 27:35.959
I think she knows,
in her way.

27:38.529 --> 27:40.530
Not everything, but...

27:41.766 --> 27:42.899
enough.

27:44.001 --> 27:46.068
You should tell her all.

27:47.405 --> 27:49.005
Why?

27:49.007 --> 27:51.808
She will take your pain
and make it hers.

27:51.810 --> 27:53.276
That is what she does.

27:53.278 --> 27:55.144
Don't you think
she has enough to worry about?

27:55.146 --> 27:56.512
She is without limits.

27:57.614 --> 27:58.747
And your limits?

28:03.586 --> 28:06.989
I have been much feared
and hated in my life.

28:08.391 --> 28:10.893
By my people, by yours.

28:12.161 --> 28:16.432
These marks mean
I was a slave trader.

28:19.268 --> 28:21.169
This is my sin to live with.

28:24.541 --> 28:26.475
But in this house

28:26.477 --> 28:29.945
I have found kindness
among the unkind.

28:33.382 --> 28:34.749
So have you.

28:49.297 --> 28:51.932
I've not had many friends
in my time...

28:54.670 --> 28:56.203
but I'm proud...

28:58.006 --> 29:00.040
to count you among them.

29:05.446 --> 29:08.682
Get some rest,
Ethan Chandler...

29:10.252 --> 29:12.519
for tomorrow we see none.

29:48.755 --> 29:49.822
- [gun cocks]
- There, there, Ethan,

29:49.824 --> 29:51.657
calm yourself.

29:51.659 --> 29:53.759
You're in no danger from me.

29:55.494 --> 29:56.661
How did you get in?

29:56.663 --> 29:59.965
Oh, your ingenious charms
and spells and such?

29:59.967 --> 30:02.600
I'm sure those little totems
are very comforting to you,

30:02.602 --> 30:03.802
but they've no real power

30:03.804 --> 30:05.804
to those
who don't believe in them.

30:07.340 --> 30:09.207
What do you want?

30:09.209 --> 30:11.208
I think the more
appertain question is

30:11.210 --> 30:13.578
what do you want,
Mr. Chandler?

30:19.819 --> 30:23.020
Such a grim little room,
really.

30:23.022 --> 30:24.589
Do your ambitions
not exceed this?

30:25.691 --> 30:27.624
I have no ambition.

30:27.626 --> 30:29.260
Everyone has ambition.

30:30.362 --> 30:32.296
And yours?

30:32.298 --> 30:34.531
To join your great enterprise.

30:35.633 --> 30:36.968
I don't mean Miss Ives

30:36.970 --> 30:38.702
and the rest of this
woebegone bunch...

30:39.804 --> 30:41.572
I mean yours.

30:43.708 --> 30:45.476
The Wolf of God.

30:48.212 --> 30:49.947
You have been chosen.

30:49.949 --> 30:51.949
You are unlike all others

30:51.951 --> 30:54.852
and you have
a profound destiny.

30:54.854 --> 30:56.453
Will you seize it?

30:57.555 --> 30:59.422
And what's that destiny?

30:59.424 --> 31:02.058
To strike with impunity.

31:02.060 --> 31:03.793
To feed at will.

31:04.895 --> 31:08.164
To serve not
the emaciated Galilean God

31:08.166 --> 31:11.001
but to stand alongside
the great winged Lucifer

31:11.003 --> 31:13.236
as he reconquers
heaven's bloody throne.

31:13.238 --> 31:14.704
Will you crawl
with the insects,

31:14.706 --> 31:16.506
or will you rise over them?

31:19.275 --> 31:21.276
[shuddered breath]
Say I put a bullet in you?

31:23.881 --> 31:25.581
Do it.

31:25.583 --> 31:28.317
That won't change
what's going to happen.

31:30.320 --> 31:32.955
- Will it kill you?
- Oh, yes.

31:32.957 --> 31:35.590
Doesn't take a silver bullet
to kill us.

31:35.592 --> 31:37.759
But pull the trigger

31:37.761 --> 31:39.594
and you deny yourself
the one person

31:39.596 --> 31:41.163
who could be
your greatest ally

31:41.165 --> 31:44.166
in the future that awaits you.

31:44.168 --> 31:46.835
You have been given
a great power.

31:47.970 --> 31:49.571
One day you will use it

31:49.573 --> 31:54.175
and take your foretold place
over these mortal animals.

31:54.177 --> 31:56.545
You know in your heart
I'm speaking the truth.

31:58.313 --> 31:59.681
Admit it.

32:03.185 --> 32:04.419
Yes.

32:04.421 --> 32:07.255
You are what you are.

32:08.490 --> 32:10.558
And when you're ready,

32:10.560 --> 32:12.993
I will serve you best of all.

32:44.625 --> 32:45.792
[sighs]

32:48.563 --> 32:50.397
[breathing deeply]

34:22.520 --> 34:24.821
Do you know what he's doing?

34:24.822 --> 34:26.356
No, Miss.

34:26.358 --> 34:28.458
I'm so curious.

34:28.460 --> 34:29.793
For months now
those workers have been

34:29.795 --> 34:31.628
coming and going over there.

34:31.630 --> 34:34.097
Pounding away with hammers.

34:34.099 --> 34:36.900
- Another attraction, I'm sure.
- [sighs]

34:36.902 --> 34:38.702
Father and his ballyhoos.

34:38.704 --> 34:39.869
As if those
hideous crime scenes

34:39.871 --> 34:41.536
weren't bad enough.

34:41.539 --> 34:45.074
But he hasn't asked me
to work on any new figures.

34:45.077 --> 34:48.043
That's odd, don't you think?

34:48.045 --> 34:50.714
I couldn't say, Miss.
Good night, Miss Lavinia.

34:50.716 --> 34:53.815
- See you tomorrow.
- Mr. Clare...

34:53.818 --> 34:55.918
I have a wicked sort of idea.

34:55.920 --> 34:57.820
Let's go explore
what Father's been building.

34:58.988 --> 35:00.690
I shouldn't tether you
to my intrigues,

35:00.692 --> 35:02.558
but I'm so damnably curious.

35:02.560 --> 35:05.661
I can't very well
go adventuring on my own.

35:05.663 --> 35:07.463
Shall you be my gun-bearer
and guide?

35:08.832 --> 35:12.067
- Uh... I really don't think...
- Oh, please.

35:12.069 --> 35:14.903
There's some things
I can't do by myself,

35:14.905 --> 35:16.839
as much as that galls me.

35:17.941 --> 35:20.008
And you are my true friend.

35:21.211 --> 35:22.211
Please.

35:26.682 --> 35:27.716
No one will know.

35:30.219 --> 35:31.553
I promise.

35:34.490 --> 35:36.090
Uh, this way then.

35:36.092 --> 35:37.792
[chuckles]

35:37.794 --> 35:39.527
[Mr. Clare]
But let's be quick.

35:41.130 --> 35:43.131
[Lavinia]
Tell me what you see.

35:43.133 --> 35:44.265
[Mr. Clare] A cell...

35:45.367 --> 35:47.334
with a heavy iron door.

35:47.336 --> 35:49.036
I don't understand.

35:49.038 --> 35:50.772
Is it for animals?

35:50.774 --> 35:53.141
I believe so.
There's a row of them.

35:53.143 --> 35:55.109
Watch your step there.

35:55.111 --> 35:57.711
My God.
He's not opening a zoo now.

35:57.713 --> 35:59.813
[Mr. Clare chuckles]
I'm afraid so.

35:59.815 --> 36:03.016
Are they empty?
Tell me what you see.

36:03.018 --> 36:05.519
No, there's something
in one of them. A book.

36:05.521 --> 36:06.853
What book?

36:09.257 --> 36:10.591
Stay here.

36:17.364 --> 36:20.533
I'll tell you.
It's a book of poetry.

36:21.635 --> 36:23.603
You should enjoy that.

36:37.418 --> 36:39.051
[gasping]

36:40.187 --> 36:41.854
How old are you?

36:41.856 --> 36:43.389
Ancient.

36:45.492 --> 36:48.660
- Can you die?
- Find out. [gasps]

36:52.065 --> 36:54.099
[exhales deeply]

36:54.101 --> 36:56.869
When we could do
so much together?

36:58.471 --> 36:59.471
No.

37:01.774 --> 37:05.644
This sad little world is ours.

37:08.013 --> 37:09.280
[biting]

37:09.282 --> 37:10.281
[gasping]

37:11.584 --> 37:12.718
[Dorian groans]

37:14.220 --> 37:15.454
[exclaims]

37:23.428 --> 37:27.732
Now... let me see your power.

37:29.902 --> 37:31.635
Go heal yourself...

37:34.106 --> 37:36.674
my beloved immortal.

37:43.147 --> 37:44.548
She's gone.

37:44.550 --> 37:47.885
Oh, for fuck's sake.
Get the others.

37:47.887 --> 37:48.786
Ethan, you can't go tonight.

37:49.888 --> 37:51.088
Get the others.

38:02.267 --> 38:03.867
She should have known better.

38:03.869 --> 38:05.969
That doesn't matter now.
We have to help her.

38:05.971 --> 38:09.572
You have no idea what hell
you are stepping into.

38:09.574 --> 38:11.875
She's there now.
That's all that matters.

38:11.877 --> 38:13.209
Surely you jest.

38:16.614 --> 38:17.847
Mmm.

38:17.849 --> 38:19.783
Come on,
we have to go out the back.

38:19.785 --> 38:21.050
We don't want to be followed.

38:21.052 --> 38:23.352
There's a way out
through the cellar.

38:30.794 --> 38:32.194
[door opening]

38:39.602 --> 38:41.670
You should not go.

38:41.672 --> 38:44.540
You know
what is going to happen.

38:44.542 --> 38:45.874
Let it.

38:51.280 --> 38:54.349
It was ever so suspenseful.

38:54.351 --> 38:56.785
Would you question
all the new construction?

38:56.787 --> 39:00.188
Would you creep in
and take a look?

39:00.190 --> 39:03.224
But I told my parents
you're a man of honor.

39:03.226 --> 39:04.359
You were mistaken.

39:04.361 --> 39:06.094
[chuckles]

39:06.096 --> 39:08.563
Then why are you in that cell,
Mr. Clare?

39:09.798 --> 39:11.366
In truth,
I'm rather glad it was I

39:11.368 --> 39:14.102
who got to entrap you
so artfully.

39:14.104 --> 39:16.637
God, all those tedious
discussions we had.

39:16.639 --> 39:19.006
Not everyone shares
your mania for poetry.

39:20.108 --> 39:21.308
[door opening]

39:30.485 --> 39:32.285
Hello, Mr. Clare.

39:34.522 --> 39:36.890
- Why am I here?
- It's your new home.

39:36.892 --> 39:38.992
Albeit a bit
on the wee side...

39:40.160 --> 39:42.061
but you'll soon
have compatriots

39:42.063 --> 39:43.463
to ease the boredom.

39:43.465 --> 39:45.131
It's where he belongs.

39:45.133 --> 39:46.832
Animals are right in cages.

39:46.834 --> 39:48.834
There, there, Mrs. Putney.

39:50.770 --> 39:52.705
Have you puzzled it out?

39:52.707 --> 39:54.840
You're to put me on display.

39:57.310 --> 39:58.978
Not just you, pet.

40:00.246 --> 40:03.315
What can the carnival
escapologist or fortune teller

40:03.317 --> 40:06.118
compare to living,
breathing freaks?

40:08.021 --> 40:09.421
You can't keep me here.

40:09.423 --> 40:12.957
But of course we can.
That's the point, Sonny Jim.

40:12.959 --> 40:15.260
Scream your lungs out
if you like. No one will hear.

40:15.262 --> 40:17.562
And even if they could,
who would care?

40:17.564 --> 40:19.597
You know Londoners.

40:19.599 --> 40:21.166
What care they
for the suffering of

40:21.168 --> 40:23.301
malformed brutes?

40:24.537 --> 40:27.305
They will look
and they will point...

40:28.941 --> 40:30.909
and they will pay.

40:38.450 --> 40:40.718
I've tasted success, sir...

40:42.154 --> 40:44.821
and it's a meal
I now wish to devour.

42:16.345 --> 42:18.046
[door creaking]

43:07.461 --> 43:09.829
Welcome to my home, Miss Ives.

43:09.831 --> 43:11.064
Where is he?

43:11.066 --> 43:12.865
Cowering in a corner,

43:12.867 --> 43:15.234
a silk thread away
from madness by now,

43:15.236 --> 43:16.969
- I should think.
- Let him go.

43:16.971 --> 43:19.038
I shall in time.

43:19.040 --> 43:22.408
He's lost his power
to entertain me.

43:24.377 --> 43:29.648
When men become mad,
they quite lose their dignity.

43:29.650 --> 43:32.351
And without that, well...

43:33.553 --> 43:35.321
what are they

43:35.323 --> 43:39.124
but throbbing vermin
made to procreate and expire?

43:42.529 --> 43:43.995
Come this way.

43:54.506 --> 43:58.409
My sister was always a bit of
an embarrassment to me.

43:58.411 --> 44:01.279
Very headstrong, wasn't she?

44:01.281 --> 44:03.748
She could have had the world
and all its riches,

44:03.750 --> 44:05.783
instead, she chose
that grotesque little hovel

44:05.785 --> 44:07.752
and her abortionist knives.

44:08.854 --> 44:11.322
Did you enjoy
watching her burn?

44:11.324 --> 44:14.892
Not near as much as I enjoyed
watching you branded.

44:14.894 --> 44:16.561
Still stings, doesn't it?

44:17.663 --> 44:19.429
That flesh is dead.

44:19.431 --> 44:20.564
We'll see.

44:20.566 --> 44:24.235
Miss Ives,
what a distinct pleasure.

44:25.336 --> 44:26.703
Welcome to my home.

44:26.705 --> 44:29.306
Not quite yet, dear girl.

44:31.209 --> 44:33.778
Now prepare the others.
They'll be here soon.

44:34.880 --> 44:36.012
Who?

44:37.114 --> 44:38.649
Your friends, of course.

44:39.751 --> 44:41.618
[Hecate] We'll be ready.

44:41.620 --> 44:44.954
And I've a singular welcome
in mind for Mr. Chandler

44:44.956 --> 44:48.191
who I saw earlier
this evening, by the way.

44:51.663 --> 44:53.596
I kissed his lips.

44:59.270 --> 45:00.937
I still taste him.

45:09.479 --> 45:11.046
This way, Miss Ives.

45:12.349 --> 45:13.816
I need to see
Sir Malcolm immediately.

45:17.954 --> 45:20.790
There's someone else
you need to see first.

45:32.702 --> 45:34.536
So, I'm to meet your Master?

45:35.638 --> 45:37.405
Oh, my darling...

45:38.607 --> 45:40.608
he's your Master as well.

45:44.313 --> 45:45.714
[door opens]

46:15.309 --> 46:17.644
You and Mr. Lyle
take the front.

46:18.747 --> 46:21.047
We'll find another way in.

46:21.049 --> 46:22.949
And then what do we do?

46:24.886 --> 46:27.287
Kill everyone
you don't recognize.

46:33.928 --> 46:35.295
[exhales]

46:36.630 --> 46:39.832
- All right then.
- Wait. If you would.

46:42.103 --> 46:44.504
[praying in Hebrew]

46:55.015 --> 46:56.616
Far be it from me.

47:14.334 --> 47:16.902
Don't let me hurt our friends.
Promise me.

47:18.004 --> 47:19.771
On your life.

47:19.773 --> 47:20.972
Yes.

47:45.397 --> 47:46.564
My God.

50:48.707 --> 50:50.574

50:50.576 --> 50:51.709
It's Doctor Frankenstein.

- I know.

51:56.873 --> 51:58.007
No!

52:00.777 --> 52:02.644
You must!

52:02.646 --> 52:03.746
I beg you!

52:04.848 --> 52:06.215
I will not.

52:08.651 --> 52:10.885
I am just a man.

52:10.887 --> 52:14.223
You have been chosen by God.

52:19.829 --> 52:22.130
My friend, Ethan Chandler.

52:25.201 --> 52:26.901
[whimpering]

52:55.764 --> 52:58.799
- And these are your works?
- Mmm.

53:00.101 --> 53:01.869
From over the years.

53:04.205 --> 53:06.874
They facilitate
my singular occupation.

53:10.245 --> 53:13.013
Handsome bits of the craft,
aren't they?

53:27.227 --> 53:28.227
Murderer.
