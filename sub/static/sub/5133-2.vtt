WEBVTT

00:10.759 --> 00:11.965
Previously on "Power."

00:13.400 --> 00:14.400
Boss is here.

00:14.560 --> 00:15.925
It's the best goddamn nightclub
opening the whole year.

00:16.120 --> 00:17.120
To Truth!

00:17.280 --> 00:18.280
To Truth!

00:18.440 --> 00:19.771
When we met,

00:19.920 --> 00:20.920
who'd you think
I was gonna be?

00:21.120 --> 00:23.646
The biggest goddamn drug dealer
in New York City.

00:23.800 --> 00:24.800
The men you're protecting

00:25.000 --> 00:27.890
set you out to steal from
the wrong motherfuckers tonight.

00:28.039 --> 00:30.202
If I knew who ordered it,
yeah, they'd be dead already.

00:30.359 --> 00:32.646
50 stacks,
75 you bring him to us alive.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.490
It's good to see
that you knew enough

00:35.679 --> 00:37.488
not to let it affect
our pay schedule.

00:37.679 --> 00:39.887
Angela Valdes came
into the club last night.

00:40.039 --> 00:41.280
From high school?

00:41.439 --> 00:43.966
Jamie,
I'm sorry I left the way I did.

00:44.119 --> 00:45.201
Who can give us the names,

00:45.359 --> 00:47.966
places and dates
we need to convict Lobos?

00:48.119 --> 00:50.121
His New York distributor.

00:50.320 --> 00:52.209
Unfortunately,
we have no idea who that is.

00:52.399 --> 00:54.003
Our soldiers are strapped now.

00:54.159 --> 00:55.649
We should be, too.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074

02:56.000 --> 02:57.286
My girlfriend,
she just got mugged.

02:57.439 --> 02:59.043
The guy got away.

02:59.240 --> 03:01.561
Please, please send
an ambulance!

03:08.199 --> 03:11.362
- Tommy, what's up?
- Julio got a 911.

03:11.520 --> 03:12.646
A courier's been hit.

03:12.800 --> 03:13.800
I'm on my way.

03:16.039 --> 03:17.165
Boss, where you going?

03:17.319 --> 03:18.969
The woman from "Vogue"
is coming to talk details

03:19.120 --> 03:20.200
for the party, remember?

03:20.360 --> 03:21.724
She lost her venue
at the last minute.

03:21.879 --> 03:23.006
We land it,
it can change everything.

03:23.159 --> 03:24.490
I know, I'll be back.

03:27.879 --> 03:28.881
De Sangre?

03:29.039 --> 03:31.326
This guy came all the way from Miami
to fuck with us?

03:31.520 --> 03:32.965
A hired hitter is smart.

03:33.120 --> 03:35.043
Somebody flies him up,
he does the job and then goes home.

03:35.199 --> 03:36.406
No trace.

03:36.560 --> 03:37.971
Well, the good news,
the girl called Julio.

03:38.120 --> 03:39.200
He's probably still
at the hospital.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.242
- Probably.
- Haven't heard from him yet.

03:41.400 --> 03:42.480
When Darien was cleaning up,
he said that the girl

03:42.639 --> 03:43.640
was cut up pretty bad.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.164
So she could be dead by now.

03:46.639 --> 03:47.687
I gotta get back to the club.

03:47.840 --> 03:49.251
There's a lot of shit
I need to be doing right now.

03:49.400 --> 03:51.640
We opened that place
to clean our money.

03:51.800 --> 03:53.643
The shit you need
to be doing right now

03:53.800 --> 03:56.007
is helping me figure out
our next fucking move.

04:00.599 --> 04:01.806
Okay, how'd they find her?

04:01.960 --> 04:03.290
Followed her, maybe?

04:03.439 --> 04:04.441
From where, how?

04:04.639 --> 04:07.848
It's just like Cruz, they knew exactly
when and where to hit.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.569
The phones,
they got our phones.

04:12.719 --> 04:14.926
I don't see how, they're all burners,
none of them traceable.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.923
FlexiSPY, some shit,
they gotta be tracking us

04:17.079 --> 04:19.367
some kind of way.

04:19.519 --> 04:21.283
Everybody
rotates phones tonight.

04:21.439 --> 04:23.124
Yeah, as soon as I get
the all clear from Julio.

04:23.319 --> 04:25.891
Listen, once we figure out
who hired this asshole,

04:26.040 --> 04:28.519
we need to mount up,
clean up the yard once and for all.

04:28.680 --> 04:31.444
With who, hmm?

04:31.600 --> 04:33.682
Our operation's built
for finesse.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.204
We got motherfuckers
that blend in.

04:35.360 --> 04:38.170
Part of the scenery, we ain't got
no real street soldiers.

04:38.319 --> 04:39.526
So we find some
or buy some.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.047
- Ask Lobos for help.
- No.

04:42.199 --> 04:44.168
'Cause if he sends it,
then he owns us forever.

04:44.319 --> 04:45.605
And if not, he takes advantage
of our weakness

04:45.800 --> 04:46.800
and he sells us out.

04:46.959 --> 04:49.042
Either way,
we're fucked.

04:54.159 --> 04:55.730
You're right about one thing.

04:55.879 --> 04:56.961
We can't let this go unanswered.

04:57.120 --> 04:59.043
That's goddamn right.

04:59.199 --> 05:01.567
Look, man,
I gotta get back, seriously.

05:01.720 --> 05:03.927
Yo, D, you got the ax?

05:04.920 --> 05:06.843
Hey, Shawn,
get in here and help him.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.286
You don't need to do that.

05:08.439 --> 05:11.250
His father would want us
to teach him the ropes, G.

05:11.399 --> 05:13.242
If he ain't gonna get his hands dirty,
he doesn't need to be there.

05:13.399 --> 05:14.970
I can do it.

05:17.920 --> 05:19.922
Unless you need me
to drive you back into the city.

05:25.759 --> 05:28.240
I'll drive myself.

05:28.399 --> 05:30.242
Call me when you hear
from Julio about the girl.

05:30.399 --> 05:34.449
Have a good day at work, honey.

05:37.199 --> 05:38.201
Fuck you.

05:41.040 --> 05:42.451
Here, gimme that.

05:44.079 --> 05:46.321
Hey, watch this, Shawn.

05:50.360 --> 05:51.930
Well, does James even bother
to call and tell you

05:52.120 --> 05:54.168
that he's not coming home
to have dinner with the kids?

05:54.319 --> 05:56.163
He doesn't have to call.
I know where he is.

05:56.319 --> 05:57.321
He's working.

05:57.480 --> 05:59.288
He's trying to book a big party
at the club tomorrow night

05:59.439 --> 06:00.725
for "Vogue" magazine.

06:00.920 --> 06:02.444
That's what he told you.

06:02.600 --> 06:04.601
Yes, and if it--

06:04.800 --> 06:07.485
If it were the other business,
he'd tell me that, too.

06:07.639 --> 06:08.687
We're partners, Mama.

06:08.839 --> 06:11.365
It's a marriage.

06:11.519 --> 06:13.648
But you wouldn't know
too much about that.

06:13.800 --> 06:16.201
Well, if he tells you everything,
you tell me

06:16.360 --> 06:19.125
why he'd open a night club
in the first place.

06:19.279 --> 06:21.122
For appearances,
like the Laundromat.

06:21.279 --> 06:23.850
Ain't no magazine party
at no Laundromats, Tasha.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.480
High-fashion models,
young girls.

06:26.639 --> 06:28.324
Hard for a man
to say no to that.

06:28.480 --> 06:30.766
Ghost ain't checkin' for
no flat-assed skinny white girl.

06:30.920 --> 06:32.649
Not when he got
all this ass at home.

06:32.800 --> 06:35.201
I used to have one
just like that, sugar.

06:35.360 --> 06:38.125
Now you let me tell you one thing
I do know about men.

06:38.279 --> 06:41.601
There is always another ass.

06:41.759 --> 06:44.127
Mama,
Ghost and I are fine.

06:44.279 --> 06:47.841
And as long as I'm paying your rent,
you need to mind your mouth.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.843
James pays my rent.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Don't get it twisted.

06:51.159 --> 06:53.526
If he leaves you,
he leaves all of us.

06:53.720 --> 06:55.927
That ring on your finger
ain't no insurance.

06:56.079 --> 06:58.526
You can't collect alimony
on income the government

06:58.680 --> 06:59.966
don't know about.

07:07.480 --> 07:12.088
Thanks for coming to cook.
But you don't need to, I'm okay.

07:14.519 --> 07:16.204
Mm-hmm.

07:16.360 --> 07:18.362
Eat, mamita.

07:18.519 --> 07:20.761
When was the last time
you went to see papi?

07:22.319 --> 07:24.048
I haven't been up there
in a while.

07:24.199 --> 07:26.487
It's not that good a place.

07:26.639 --> 07:28.165
We should still go see the one
upstate again.

07:29.959 --> 07:31.370
It's pretty up there.

07:31.519 --> 07:34.329
Plus, I like the idea of him
being able to see the water.

07:34.480 --> 07:37.290
I do, too. But I told you,
the one upstate is too expensive.

07:38.720 --> 07:40.927
Junior's tuition
check is by the door.

07:41.079 --> 07:42.730
Thank you.

07:42.879 --> 07:44.324
You know I'll pay
you back every cent.

07:44.519 --> 07:46.887
I'm happy to do it.

07:47.040 --> 07:49.566
But papi has to stay
where he is for right now, okay?

07:55.879 --> 07:59.122
When Junior graduates,
we'll have no kids left in the family.

07:59.279 --> 08:00.690
There's plenty back in P.R.

08:00.839 --> 08:02.490
You can bring Nadia's
five boys back with you

08:02.639 --> 08:03.641
next time you go.

08:03.800 --> 08:05.961
Cute. You know what I mean.

08:06.120 --> 08:08.600
What's happening with Greg?

08:08.800 --> 08:10.848
I'm not sure.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.927
Don't look at me like that.

08:15.079 --> 08:16.490
I just don't think
he's the right guy.

08:16.680 --> 08:18.444
They're never the right guy.

08:18.639 --> 08:19.641
What's wrong with this one?

08:19.800 --> 08:21.290
He can't fuck?

08:21.439 --> 08:23.362
The sex is good.

08:23.560 --> 08:24.560
There's nothing wrong, but...

08:27.000 --> 08:29.730
there's no goose bumps.
No butterflies.

08:29.879 --> 08:31.927
There's no tingling anywhere,
you know?

08:32.080 --> 08:34.207
You still think of love
like you're a little girl.

08:35.440 --> 08:39.285
Butterflies and goose bumps
are fairytales.

08:39.440 --> 08:42.489
Mira, nena.

08:50.440 --> 08:58.440
<b><font color=#004F8C>Ripped By mstoll</b></font>

09:05.960 --> 09:07.325
Stick with us.

09:07.519 --> 09:08.931
You'll get your own
someday.

09:09.080 --> 09:12.004
But some nights,
have a body in the trunk.

09:12.159 --> 09:16.721
Back in the day,
Ghost and I drove a '91 Honda Accord.

09:16.879 --> 09:18.847
You shared a car?

09:19.000 --> 09:20.923
We got more pussy
in that back seat--

09:21.120 --> 09:23.282
Back then, Kanan
kept us in line.

09:23.440 --> 09:26.091
Taught us the business,
made us men.

09:26.240 --> 09:28.082
Ghost and I owe your father big.

09:28.240 --> 09:29.969
That's why you're here.

09:31.600 --> 09:33.523
I know.

09:34.679 --> 09:37.331
Ghost just wants you to stay
in the car and in the club.

09:37.480 --> 09:39.642
See the pretty shit.

09:39.799 --> 09:41.802
But if we go to war,

09:41.960 --> 09:43.200
it'll be all hands on deck.

09:43.360 --> 09:45.760
I need to know
you'll be ready.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.046
I won't let you down.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.730
Good.

10:09.720 --> 10:11.847
Ms. Sheridan.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.081
James St. Patrick.

10:14.240 --> 10:15.287
Nice to finally meet you.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.488
You're James St. Patrick.

10:17.639 --> 10:19.562
You know, I tried to run
a background check on you,

10:19.759 --> 10:23.081
and no one in the nightlife world
seems to know who you are.

10:23.240 --> 10:25.207
I was expecting a fat Irish guy.

10:25.360 --> 10:27.168
Well, I hope I can meet
your other expectations.

10:27.320 --> 10:28.525
I do, too.

10:28.679 --> 10:31.967
You know we lost our venue
for this party at the last minute.

10:32.120 --> 10:35.806
But I'm not gonna make the wrong call
just because we're pressed for time.

10:35.960 --> 10:37.961
I'll decide whether
I like what I see

10:38.120 --> 10:40.043
or if I should keep going down
my list of clubs.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.606
I'll admit, it's a beautiful space
you've got here.

10:42.759 --> 10:44.966
But what turns my head
is perfect service.

10:45.159 --> 10:47.207
Seamless evening.

10:47.360 --> 10:49.726
And that is what my client expects.

10:49.879 --> 10:52.405
But I see you've been working hard.

10:52.559 --> 10:55.802
We have, Ms. Sheridan, we haven't left
a single moment to chance.

10:55.960 --> 11:00.009
That's good, because this party isn't
only about our December issue,

11:00.159 --> 11:02.447
which is the biggest
in fashion magazine history.

11:02.639 --> 11:04.323
- It's also about--
- Your boss' position.

11:04.480 --> 11:06.481
Editors all over your building
report to her.

11:06.679 --> 11:08.125
This party's about,
let's say, um--

11:08.279 --> 11:10.202
makin' them feel it.

11:11.440 --> 11:13.249
You don't look like
you read Keith Kelly.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.807
I make it my business to know
what you know, Ms. Sheridan.

11:15.960 --> 11:17.404
If I'm doing my job,
I should know what you want

11:17.559 --> 11:19.085
before you ask me for it.

11:28.720 --> 11:31.485
Hey, send a bottle
or two of Ultimate to VIP

11:31.639 --> 11:32.846
with some cranberry juice.

11:33.039 --> 11:34.883
We've got a promotion tonight, sir.
We're not serving Ultimate,

11:35.039 --> 11:37.360
just Grey Goose.

11:37.519 --> 11:38.567
Honey, you're
serving whatever I want.

11:38.759 --> 11:39.807
I own this place.

11:39.960 --> 11:42.326
I've never seen you before.

11:47.840 --> 11:49.922
You see me now?

11:51.120 --> 11:54.283
Yeah, I'll sneak you some Ultimate.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.687
But I can't take it up there,
I don't work VIP.

11:59.480 --> 12:00.561
Do you want to?

12:06.240 --> 12:07.240
I get it.

12:07.399 --> 12:08.811
Page him.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.331
And where does
my client sit?

12:13.480 --> 12:15.607
Right here,
where you can see all the action.

12:15.759 --> 12:17.649
But very few can see you.

12:17.840 --> 12:18.841
She'll love it.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.764
Oh, should the photographers
check it at the front

12:20.919 --> 12:23.081
or come early
and enter through service?

12:24.240 --> 12:25.525
Cameras aren't Truth policy.

12:25.720 --> 12:27.721
We like our guests
to be able to relax without

12:27.879 --> 12:29.802
thinking their images
will be online the next morning.

12:29.960 --> 12:31.724
Okay, technically
my guys are paparazzi.

12:31.879 --> 12:34.280
But they're the obedient kind.
That's not a problem, right?

12:34.480 --> 12:37.211
I mean, I'd hate to tell everyone
we had a conflict.

12:37.399 --> 12:39.721
No, no, your photographers
can come through service early.

12:39.879 --> 12:41.165
They'll have full access.

12:41.360 --> 12:44.091
Excellent
Good night, James St. Patrick.

12:44.279 --> 12:45.644
Good night.

12:49.279 --> 12:50.441
If we're gonna have
photographers here,

12:50.600 --> 12:51.600
you should get into
some of those shots.

12:51.759 --> 12:52.760
Ain't my thing.

12:52.919 --> 12:54.445
You should be out there
as the face of the club.

12:54.600 --> 12:56.408
People are gonna wanna know
who owns this place.

12:56.559 --> 12:59.643
Stern takes us on,
we can go national.

12:59.840 --> 13:02.365
Internationally.
More people know who you are,

13:02.519 --> 13:04.283
the more interested
he's going to be.

13:31.320 --> 13:34.085
You've reached FBI
Special Agent Greg Knox,

13:34.240 --> 13:35.969
southern district of New York.
Leave a message.

13:37.279 --> 13:40.250
Hey, that's weird,
you always pick up.

13:40.399 --> 13:43.085
If you wanna come over,
I'm here.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.368
Call me.

14:17.960 --> 14:20.087
What the fu--

15:20.679 --> 15:22.489
Sorry I'm late.
Coffee smelled like dick.

15:22.639 --> 15:23.926
So I had to make a new pot.

15:24.080 --> 15:25.923
Oh, hey, sorry,
Ms. Lavarro.

15:26.080 --> 15:30.562
I'm not offended, Mr. Saxe,
the smell of dick turns me off, too.

15:30.720 --> 15:32.847
Speaking of late, you see
Agent Knox out there?

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
He should be here.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.246
No.

15:36.360 --> 15:38.202
I've charted the existing
distribution networks

15:38.360 --> 15:39.691
in the five boroughs.

15:39.840 --> 15:40.886
I'd like to construct a clear--

15:41.080 --> 15:44.288
Angela, I was thinking
we should talk more about Ruiz.

15:44.440 --> 15:45.770
Lobos moved on from Ruiz.

15:45.960 --> 15:47.529
So we should, too.
He's a dead end.

15:48.879 --> 15:50.040
Frankie, morning.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.043
- Morning.
- Good morning, sir.

15:52.200 --> 15:53.884
I'd thought I'd see
how your Felipe Lobos task force

15:54.039 --> 15:55.883
is coming along, we got a wire
from the Federales.

15:56.039 --> 15:58.326
Lobos landed
in Juarez last night.

15:58.480 --> 15:59.527
He's staying close
to the border,

15:59.679 --> 16:02.808
so now we're racing both California
and Texas on the districts

16:02.960 --> 16:03.961
to get an indictment.

16:04.120 --> 16:05.849
We're all aware of the urgency, sir.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.162
In fact,
Angela was just diving in.

16:08.360 --> 16:11.364
We're creating a profile to help us
identify Lobos' New York distro.

16:11.519 --> 16:12.759
More specifically,

16:12.919 --> 16:14.284
we were discussing
a meeting Lobos had

16:14.440 --> 16:16.283
with Víbora Ruiz
from Soldado Nation.

16:16.440 --> 16:17.441
And as discussed,

16:17.600 --> 16:20.125
Lobos told Ruiz the Soldados
were too low-rent for him.

16:20.279 --> 16:22.965
They made no agreements,
so it's not a fertile area.

16:23.120 --> 16:26.043
But how did Lobos arrange
that sit-down with Ruiz?

16:26.200 --> 16:28.407
I issued a warrant
for a Ruiz lieutenant.

16:28.559 --> 16:29.561
Nomar Arcielo.

16:29.720 --> 16:31.687
You issued the warrant
with what probable cause?

16:31.879 --> 16:33.927
A burner cell
traced to Nomar by NYPD

16:34.080 --> 16:36.923
spiked high usage details
around the time of the Lobos meeting.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.844
If he set it up,
he could have valuable information.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.527
I've worked closely with this judge,
he'll slap us down if we overreach.

16:45.679 --> 16:48.081
That's why all applications
go across my desk.

16:48.240 --> 16:51.049
Understood. I was trying
to be proactive.

16:51.200 --> 16:52.530
You know, since,
like you said, sir,

16:52.679 --> 16:54.364
other offices are on Lobos, too.

16:54.519 --> 16:56.648
Ruiz is our local advantage.

16:57.759 --> 16:59.966
In future work with the team,
cops and robbers is more fun

17:00.159 --> 17:02.128
when we all can play.

17:02.279 --> 17:03.769
In case we could
get something new,

17:03.960 --> 17:05.200
call an agent
to serve your warrant.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.441
Now, moving on--

17:06.598 --> 17:08.045
Actually, Special Agent
Greg Knox

17:08.200 --> 17:10.201
is trying to locate
Nomar as we speak.

17:10.358 --> 17:11.566
I called him last night.

17:11.720 --> 17:14.290
Great.
Now as I was saying,

17:14.440 --> 17:17.521
we know Lobos wants
a reliable pathway for his product.

17:17.720 --> 17:21.611
The most likely point of entry
is Port Elizabeth, New Jersey.

17:21.759 --> 17:25.287
So the distributor we're looking for
should have an extensive network--

17:32.640 --> 17:34.642
Thanks, babe.

17:35.960 --> 17:37.723
I'm sorry I left early
the other night.

17:37.880 --> 17:40.451
I didn't want to bother you,
you were with somebody.

17:40.599 --> 17:42.602
Looked like you really wanted
to talk to her.

17:44.079 --> 17:46.162
I ran into a friend
from high school that night.

17:46.319 --> 17:47.320
I think,
I can't remember.

17:49.680 --> 17:53.651
Hey, ain't no reason
to trip, T.

17:53.839 --> 17:58.561
- Hmm?
- Sorry.

17:58.759 --> 18:01.490
Mama and I were talking yesterday,
and I just--

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Never mind.

18:12.400 --> 18:13.401
Mrs. St. Patrick, hey.

18:13.559 --> 18:14.891
I hope it's okay,
I took some coffee.

18:17.079 --> 18:19.208
Help yourself.

18:29.160 --> 18:30.969
Where'd you grow up, Shawn?

18:31.119 --> 18:32.246
Hollis, originally.

18:32.400 --> 18:34.242
No way, I went to Cardozo.

18:34.400 --> 18:38.121
Hollis must have changed,
because I ain't never seen

18:38.279 --> 18:39.361
no girls like you
round the way.

18:39.519 --> 18:42.603
There's plenty of girls
just like me out there

18:42.759 --> 18:45.888
looking for somebody responsible
like you to treat them right.

18:46.039 --> 18:48.041
You have a girlfriend now?

18:49.359 --> 18:51.327
Wait, I probably shouldn't
ask you that.

18:51.519 --> 18:52.851
No, no, no, no.
It's cool that you asked.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.481
I ain't seeing nobody.

18:56.640 --> 18:58.801
You're single?

19:00.599 --> 19:01.931
I don't believe it.

19:06.720 --> 19:09.644
You wanted me
to see you

19:09.799 --> 19:11.801
the other night in the car?

19:14.000 --> 19:16.287
I don't know what
you're talking about.

19:16.440 --> 19:18.282
Talk to Tommy last night?

19:18.440 --> 19:19.441
Brand-new.

19:19.599 --> 19:21.125
Y'all had to rotate the phones?
What happened?

19:21.279 --> 19:24.647
Nothing,
just taking precautions.

19:24.799 --> 19:26.608
Giving that spandex
a workout of its own, girl.

19:28.119 --> 19:29.121
I'll see you tonight.

19:29.279 --> 19:31.327
- All right.
- Okay.

19:35.119 --> 19:36.359
Oh, wait!

19:36.519 --> 19:38.284
Ghost!
Your new number!

19:39.960 --> 19:42.691
How the fuck am I supposed
to get ahold of you now?

19:42.839 --> 19:44.648
Collins walks in
and Saxe busts out

19:44.799 --> 19:46.608
with this "we're not
done with Ruiz" bullshit.

19:46.759 --> 19:47.760
Turns out
you're already looking

19:47.920 --> 19:48.921
for this Nomar guy

19:49.119 --> 19:50.405
and I'm caught
with my pants down.

19:50.559 --> 19:52.005
You should've called me.

19:52.160 --> 19:53.286
Saxe gave me
explicit instructions

19:53.440 --> 19:54.566
not to do so.

19:54.720 --> 19:56.006
Okay, fuck him.

19:56.160 --> 19:57.730
But fuck you, too.
There's a chain of command.

19:57.920 --> 19:59.285
You knew he was
fucking with me.

19:59.440 --> 20:00.441
What should I have done?

20:00.599 --> 20:02.284
I call you to check in
before every move

20:02.440 --> 20:03.441
and it's pretty clear
what's going on between us,

20:03.599 --> 20:04.646
am I right?

20:05.880 --> 20:08.008
You said we had
to keep our relationship a secret.

20:08.160 --> 20:09.730
If the rules have changed,
let me know.

20:09.880 --> 20:12.041
The rules haven't changed.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.327
People find out, you'll
get "atta-boys" and high fives,

20:14.519 --> 20:17.443
while I'll lose all credibility
for fucking an agent.

20:17.599 --> 20:19.125
I don't want to go public,
I just don't want you

20:19.319 --> 20:20.809
to sandbag me.

20:20.960 --> 20:23.008
I didn't sandbag you,
I followed protocol.

20:23.200 --> 20:24.201
Those rules matter, too.

20:24.359 --> 20:26.169
Good luck finding
your man, Agent Knox.

20:26.319 --> 20:27.320
Angela,
we're not done here.

20:27.480 --> 20:30.050
Goodbye, Greg.

20:52.119 --> 20:53.690
This is ridiculous.

21:04.559 --> 21:05.560
We're sorry.

21:05.720 --> 21:08.529
The number you have reached
is not in service.

21:08.680 --> 21:10.443
Please check the number
or try your call--

21:39.000 --> 21:40.125
Excuse me.

21:40.279 --> 21:41.724
Is James here?

21:41.880 --> 21:43.882
Yeah.

21:49.119 --> 21:50.246
Got eyes on the boss?

21:57.119 --> 21:58.644
Angie.

21:58.799 --> 22:00.768
Jamie!

22:00.960 --> 22:03.087
Sorry I had to
track you down at work.

22:03.240 --> 22:04.923
You changed your cell?

22:06.839 --> 22:09.650
I had to ditch my phone.

22:09.799 --> 22:10.846
Nightclub business,
you know,

22:11.000 --> 22:13.082
too many people
get your number, it gets messy.

22:13.240 --> 22:15.208
I'm glad you actually called.

22:15.359 --> 22:17.088
This place looks so different
during the day.

22:17.240 --> 22:18.923
You're saying
it looks busted now?

22:19.079 --> 22:20.650
A little.

22:20.799 --> 22:24.281
No, I'm just surprised
at how at night it's--

22:24.440 --> 22:26.727
transformed.

22:26.880 --> 22:28.086
That's the idea.

22:28.279 --> 22:31.203
People come here and become
whoever they want to be for the night.

22:31.359 --> 22:33.282
It's a fantasy.

22:33.440 --> 22:34.770
And then they buy
a lot of drinks.

22:34.920 --> 22:36.729
Yes.

22:36.880 --> 22:39.008
You still haven't told me
how you made this happen.

22:39.160 --> 22:41.970
We cleaned up an abandoned lot,
charged for parking,

22:42.119 --> 22:43.609
that money
bought a Laundromat.

22:43.759 --> 22:46.080
And another
and another.

22:46.240 --> 22:48.447
I always had my father's place
in the back of my mind.

22:48.599 --> 22:53.002
And then we found this space,
and Tommy thought I was crazy.

22:53.160 --> 22:54.161
Wait, Tommy?

22:54.319 --> 22:55.320
Tommy Egan?

22:55.480 --> 22:57.800
You still hang out with him?

22:57.960 --> 22:59.121
He's my partner in the club.

22:59.279 --> 23:00.644
What? You surprised
we still tight?

23:00.799 --> 23:02.643
Yeah, to be honest.

23:02.799 --> 23:05.121
I always thought Tommy
liked the streets too much.

23:07.160 --> 23:09.560
You must have been
a good influence on him.

23:11.200 --> 23:12.963
Let me
show you something.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.125
Watch your step.

23:21.119 --> 23:22.121
Are you serious?

23:22.279 --> 23:25.045
I didn't know people
still made these.

23:26.640 --> 23:28.642
Close your eyes.

23:30.720 --> 23:31.721
Close your eyes, Angie.

23:31.880 --> 23:33.369
They're closed.

23:56.319 --> 23:58.209
This still
your favorite song?

23:58.359 --> 23:59.520
Are you kidding me?

23:59.680 --> 24:01.603
Makes me want to break
out the baseball jersey

24:01.759 --> 24:03.171
and the kneepads
for the video.

24:10.039 --> 24:11.201
So what happens next?

24:11.359 --> 24:12.884
I know you got a plan.

24:13.880 --> 24:15.529
If Truth takes off,

24:15.720 --> 24:18.200
then we open a second club
right here in New York City.

24:20.200 --> 24:21.724
And maybe one
in Miami or Vegas.

24:21.880 --> 24:22.881
It's gonna take a while,
but I'll--

24:23.039 --> 24:24.279
You'll get there.

24:24.480 --> 24:26.403
You got here.

24:30.559 --> 24:31.766
You want to come through tonight?

24:31.920 --> 24:33.808
We got a big party
for "Vogue" magazine.

24:35.559 --> 24:37.881
Wow, that's huge!

24:39.799 --> 24:41.882
I wish I could,
I gotta work.

24:42.079 --> 24:44.002
I hope your clients pay extra
for that kind of dedication.

24:44.160 --> 24:45.161
Damn.

24:45.319 --> 24:47.560
It's not that kind of--
I work for the government.

24:47.720 --> 24:51.644
It's boring.

24:51.839 --> 24:53.922
Anyway, you're gonna be too busy
tonight to hang out with me.

24:54.079 --> 24:55.411
I'll make the time.

24:58.440 --> 24:59.884
Come on, Angie.

25:02.079 --> 25:03.888
Okay, I'll come through.

25:04.039 --> 25:05.086
Yeah?

25:10.720 --> 25:12.164
Go, go, go, go, go!

25:14.200 --> 25:16.726
Oh, come on, Uncle Tommy,
you're supposed to have my back!

25:16.880 --> 25:19.201
Is this some sped-up mode
or something?

25:19.359 --> 25:21.169
I don't remember it
being this fast.

25:21.319 --> 25:22.320
No, you're just old.

25:22.480 --> 25:23.720
Just wait. What?

25:23.880 --> 25:24.881
You're old!

25:25.079 --> 25:26.490
I got next.

25:26.640 --> 25:28.050
Oh, what's up, Dad?

25:28.200 --> 25:29.440
What's up, son?

25:29.599 --> 25:30.646
Go finish your homework.

25:30.839 --> 25:31.965
- I know you didn't finish it.
- Good night.

25:32.119 --> 25:33.121
Get outta here.

25:33.279 --> 25:35.123
And what did I tell you
about playing on the games, huh?

25:46.000 --> 25:47.843
The girl who got cut,
you want to clip?

25:48.000 --> 25:49.240
I don't see another way.

25:49.440 --> 25:50.851
I don't know, man.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.888
Like you said,
she followed protocol.

25:53.039 --> 25:55.326
She called Julio.
She didn't call 911,

25:55.480 --> 25:56.560
even to save her own life.

25:56.720 --> 25:59.962
She calls 911 with the drugs on her,
she could go into jail.

26:00.160 --> 26:01.365
She kept a cool head.

26:01.519 --> 26:03.807
You and I are good, Tommy,
because she didn't fuck it up.

26:03.960 --> 26:06.280
What does it say to other soldiers
if she does her job well

26:06.440 --> 26:08.249
and we ice her anyway?

26:08.400 --> 26:09.480
Nice kill!

26:09.640 --> 26:11.881
The truth.
They're replaceable.

26:12.039 --> 26:13.404
Just like you wanted it.

26:13.559 --> 26:16.244
She's replaceable.

26:16.400 --> 26:18.242
This is a female
we're talking about, Ghost.

26:18.400 --> 26:21.608
Who's gonna want her now?

26:21.759 --> 26:24.161
One day she's gonna wake up,
look at her ruined fucking face

26:24.319 --> 26:26.288
and her ruined fucking life,
and she's gonna blame us for it.

26:26.480 --> 26:28.209
And even though she doesn't know us,
she knows Julio.

26:28.359 --> 26:30.124
She knows how
our whole thing works.

26:30.279 --> 26:32.407
She's gonna be like,
"Fuck these motherfuckers,

26:32.559 --> 26:34.324
I'm going to the cops."

26:34.480 --> 26:39.201
With some random-ass courier chick?
That's a risk you wanna take?

26:42.839 --> 26:44.204
I'll talk to Julio.

26:47.200 --> 26:48.361
Yo, T, you ready to go?

26:48.519 --> 26:50.203
My reservation's in 20 minutes!

26:50.359 --> 26:52.362
Almost!

26:54.720 --> 26:56.768
Peace.

26:59.400 --> 27:01.481
No, man.
We're good. No problems.

27:01.680 --> 27:04.250
Good, let's keep it that way.

27:04.400 --> 27:07.050
Remind our people of the bitch's
description in case she comes back.

27:07.200 --> 27:09.680
What did the courier say,
"Fucking weird shoes"?

27:09.839 --> 27:11.523
Yeah, she had
bright pink sneakers on.

27:11.680 --> 27:12.885
I told them already.

27:13.039 --> 27:15.041
All right, good.

28:34.799 --> 28:37.565
I'd better be on my toes.
One of these motherfuckers staring

28:37.720 --> 28:39.006
might try to take you home.

28:41.519 --> 28:43.727
Wish I had that effect on you.

28:43.880 --> 28:46.201
What's that supposed to mean?

28:46.359 --> 28:48.327
I'm just saying, if I'm all that,

28:48.480 --> 28:50.243
you'd be home more.

28:50.400 --> 28:53.608
I'm not home because I'm working,
trying to provide for you

28:53.759 --> 28:55.046
and the kids.

28:55.200 --> 28:58.442
And for that weave and that dress
and those shoes.

28:58.599 --> 29:00.728
I don't need you stressing me,
all right?

29:00.920 --> 29:02.490
I ain't trying to stress you.

29:04.519 --> 29:07.842
But I ain't even got your new digits
and I'm your wife.

29:18.960 --> 29:23.442
Now you got me and the driver.

29:23.599 --> 29:25.045
You're right, baby.

29:25.240 --> 29:27.241
My bad, I forgot.

29:31.519 --> 29:33.170
You've been forgetting
me a lot lately.

30:23.240 --> 30:24.240
Come on!

30:24.400 --> 30:26.880
I know you're not turning down
kung pao chicken.

30:27.039 --> 30:29.724
I even got the extra peanuts
just how you like it!

30:37.119 --> 30:39.930
I'm hungry.
That doesn't mean I'm not still mad.

30:40.079 --> 30:41.605
You know I didn't
have a choice.

30:42.640 --> 30:44.926
You just don't like to lose.

30:46.759 --> 30:49.444
When you gonna tell me
what's going on, Ghost?

30:51.480 --> 30:53.288
I ain't no kid.

30:53.440 --> 30:55.807
New phones and shit?

30:58.240 --> 30:59.401
Guessing y'all had a car accident?

31:00.960 --> 31:02.529
We got run off the road.

31:04.920 --> 31:06.205
Your car still running?

31:09.400 --> 31:12.801
Still running, but the repairs
might be too expensive to make.

31:14.480 --> 31:16.209
And the other guy's car?

31:19.599 --> 31:23.445
Totaled.
We had to tow it.

31:23.599 --> 31:27.126
So now it's about
the next move.

31:32.039 --> 31:33.804
You take it to the chop shop?

31:36.319 --> 31:38.799
You still got the parts?

31:46.039 --> 31:48.849
What you thinking?

31:51.359 --> 31:53.327
Back in the day,

31:53.480 --> 31:56.768
remember what those Dominican boys
did to that red truck?

31:58.160 --> 32:01.881
Half went to one garage,
half to another?

32:03.160 --> 32:06.003
Stopped all that bullshit.

32:06.160 --> 32:08.321
Hmm.

32:08.480 --> 32:09.527
More wine, ma'am?

32:09.680 --> 32:10.681
Yes, please.

32:21.400 --> 32:24.006
Look, Saxe told me
that if nothing

32:24.160 --> 32:25.445
came from going after
Arcielo,

32:25.599 --> 32:26.964
no one
would even know about it.

32:27.119 --> 32:28.848
I didn't think he was stupid enough
to go off about it

32:29.000 --> 32:30.683
without knowing
if I'd catch the guy.

32:30.880 --> 32:33.611
Please tell me Saxe
wasted taxpayer dollars

32:33.799 --> 32:37.042
sending you on a wild-goose chase
and the guy's left town.

32:39.400 --> 32:40.447
You got him.

32:41.759 --> 32:44.047
I'm a fucking FBI agent, Angela,
damn right I got him.

32:48.440 --> 32:50.442
He still had
his goddamn phone.

32:50.599 --> 32:52.567
Conclusive proof he set
the meeting or knows who did.

32:54.720 --> 32:56.801
Saxe wins.

32:56.960 --> 32:59.008
Good news for the team,
bad news for me.

32:59.200 --> 33:00.611
Maybe not.

33:01.599 --> 33:03.250
Wait till you hear
who else he called.

33:04.240 --> 33:05.844
Isabel Ruiz.

33:06.039 --> 33:08.326
Víbora Ruiz' daughter?

33:08.480 --> 33:09.924
Isn't she 14?

33:10.079 --> 33:11.808
Mmm-hmm.

33:11.960 --> 33:13.564
Nomar called her.

33:13.759 --> 33:15.967
Multiple times a week
for weeks.

33:16.119 --> 33:17.484
No fucking way.

33:19.880 --> 33:21.847
The soldier
that got hurt's a woman.

33:23.480 --> 33:26.768
Face all cut up.
Tommy thinks she'll talk.

33:26.920 --> 33:29.684
But she was loyal,
and her life was at stake.

33:31.559 --> 33:33.767
You want a woman's loyalty,
give her security.

33:34.799 --> 33:38.963
You give her that,
she'll never betray you.

33:45.440 --> 33:48.090
Baby.
Come on.

33:48.240 --> 33:50.241
He knows better
than to watch.

33:56.519 --> 33:58.488
And Saxe
doesn't know about this?

33:58.680 --> 34:00.967
I didn't tell him.

34:01.119 --> 34:02.451
I'm telling you.

34:05.039 --> 34:06.040
So are we good?

34:12.800 --> 34:14.927
We're good.

34:23.960 --> 34:26.485
Mama took the kids
to the movies.

34:26.639 --> 34:28.369
We got an hour, maybe.

34:29.800 --> 34:31.882
When we talk business,
it's like when we

34:32.039 --> 34:33.929
first met--

34:34.079 --> 34:36.650
Black Bonnie and Clyde.

34:36.840 --> 34:39.411
What?

34:39.559 --> 34:41.608
- Nothing.
- Come on.

34:43.480 --> 34:45.766
Come on--

35:18.519 --> 35:19.521
Harder.

35:20.880 --> 35:21.880
You sure?

35:22.039 --> 35:23.280
Harder!

36:02.719 --> 36:05.086
You sure you gotta go down
to the club right now?

36:09.239 --> 36:13.005
Yeah.
I gotta go.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.001
Body.

36:25.199 --> 36:27.806
I'm expecting perfection
from you tonight.

36:27.960 --> 36:30.405
The people who are coming
to the club for this party,

36:30.559 --> 36:33.643
models, magazine editors,
actors, rich motherfuckers

36:33.800 --> 36:36.007
who ain't do nothing
to earn that shit.

36:36.159 --> 36:37.161
But they have
the right friends.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.481
They have a good time here,
they come back.

36:38.639 --> 36:40.164
They bring more people.

36:40.320 --> 36:43.085
The truth is,
the more people hear about this spot,

36:43.239 --> 36:44.240
we all get rich.

36:44.400 --> 36:45.525
I don't make you pool tips.

36:45.719 --> 36:47.005
I don't believe in that shit.

36:47.159 --> 36:48.969
Then the lazy motherfuckers win.

36:49.119 --> 36:51.804
But tonight,
you work as a team.

36:51.960 --> 36:52.960
Keep each other on point,
make it hot,

36:53.119 --> 36:54.121
give them what they want.

36:54.280 --> 36:55.280
Fellas, if a cat's gay

36:55.480 --> 36:56.969
and he wants your number,
give it to him.

36:57.119 --> 36:59.690
Ladies... shit,
you already know what to do.

36:59.840 --> 37:01.443
You been doing it
your whole lives.

37:01.599 --> 37:04.126
Tonight, our guests are drinking
on someone else's dime.

37:04.320 --> 37:06.447
Make them want to come back
and spend their own money.

37:06.599 --> 37:07.965
All right, open the doors, boss.

37:08.159 --> 37:09.365
Showtime.

37:23.960 --> 37:25.041
We're keeping track
of the arrivals,

37:25.199 --> 37:26.769
I want to know about
an Angela Valdes.

37:28.280 --> 37:30.088
No one with that name
has checked in yet.

37:30.239 --> 37:31.923
Cynthia's up in VIP, though.

37:32.079 --> 37:34.525
She's looking for you.

37:34.679 --> 37:37.411
Tell Bueso he's still gotta do
the damn deliveries.

37:37.559 --> 37:39.527
He's got his fuckin' piece, right?

37:45.400 --> 37:47.289
You've reached 3-4-7-5--

37:47.440 --> 37:49.204
Are you kidding me,
motherfucker?

38:00.519 --> 38:02.248
Hey, I have to admit,
I'm impressed.

38:02.400 --> 38:04.322
You run a smooth
operation here, James.

38:04.480 --> 38:05.891
Even my boss said
she liked the food.

38:06.039 --> 38:08.519
Not that she ate any.

38:08.719 --> 38:10.608
You know I don' t just plan
parties for "Vogue",

38:10.760 --> 38:13.126
I handle "G.Q.,"
"Allure," "Bon Appétit,"

38:13.280 --> 38:15.487
"Vanity Fair," it's events
all year long.

38:15.639 --> 38:17.722
Plus servicing
my non-Condé Nast clients.

38:17.880 --> 38:19.847
That's a lot of responsibility.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.400
You know, I was thinking
that you and I

38:22.559 --> 38:23.891
should work together
long-term.

38:24.039 --> 38:26.246
You know, I bring you the press,
the big names,

38:26.400 --> 38:28.846
you give me a big fat discount.

38:29.000 --> 38:32.208
How's that sound?

38:33.239 --> 38:34.605
Deal.

38:35.599 --> 38:38.570
Oh, you know what? I will
make sure this runs in the "Post."

38:38.719 --> 38:40.882
Get your face out there.
Make this place a brand name.

38:41.039 --> 38:42.041
What's up, man?

38:42.199 --> 38:43.360
Sir, we're just about
to take a picture.

38:43.519 --> 38:44.521
So if you can wait a minute.

38:44.679 --> 38:45.681
You can talk
to James in a sec.

38:45.880 --> 38:47.927
Oh, no, I think James wants
to talk to me right now.

38:48.079 --> 38:49.922
Cynthia, I'll be right back.

38:50.079 --> 38:51.081
Work never stops.

38:51.239 --> 38:53.242
Enjoy the party!

38:57.239 --> 38:58.320
What the fuck you thinking, man?

38:58.519 --> 38:59.931
You want to be
in the paper tomorrow?

39:00.079 --> 39:02.447
You want everyone to know
who you are, Ghost?

39:02.599 --> 39:03.760
All right, man.
No pictures.

39:03.920 --> 39:04.920
I gotta get back.
We'll talk about it later.

39:05.079 --> 39:06.730
No, we'll talk
about this right now.

39:06.880 --> 39:08.688
We're not like
these people, Ghost.

39:08.840 --> 39:10.682
You and me in the paper
ain't a good thing.

39:10.840 --> 39:12.568
You and me in the paper
means we got got.

39:12.719 --> 39:15.326
These people don't know about
our other thing, man.

39:15.480 --> 39:16.811
- One picture--
- Is too many!

39:17.000 --> 39:18.684
You standing next
to these people in pictures?

39:18.840 --> 39:21.286
The next question is,
who the fuck is this guy?

39:21.440 --> 39:22.601
People digging
in your life story,

39:22.760 --> 39:24.090
what do you think
they're gonna find?

39:24.239 --> 39:26.811
We lay low.
We sell what we need to sell.

39:26.960 --> 39:28.041
We ice who
we need to ice.

39:28.199 --> 39:29.884
All business,
all the time.

39:30.039 --> 39:31.485
This is about business.

39:31.679 --> 39:33.284
You ain't been about
business since we opened this place.

39:33.440 --> 39:35.168
Check your phone,
motherfucker!

39:39.199 --> 39:40.201
- What happened?
- Same bitch

39:40.360 --> 39:41.599
tried to jump
Bueso tonight.

39:41.760 --> 39:42.760
He got away.

39:42.920 --> 39:44.126
Must have kept his phone.

39:44.280 --> 39:45.929
No, he kept his route!

39:46.079 --> 39:48.559
These fuckers
know our system.

39:48.719 --> 39:49.846
They know our routine.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.400
What you wanna do?

39:52.559 --> 39:53.971
No time for thinkin', man.

39:54.159 --> 39:55.889
What the fuck
you wanna do?

39:57.760 --> 40:00.001
Tasha said something tonight
about the Dominicans.

40:00.159 --> 40:01.490
What they did with D-Lo,
remember that?

40:01.639 --> 40:03.289
That was some sick shit.

40:03.440 --> 40:05.248
Why don't we take that
to the next level?

40:05.400 --> 40:07.208
Show everybody
we ain't afraid to do dirty.

40:07.360 --> 40:09.931
We do it right, it'll shut
this shit down for good.

40:10.079 --> 40:11.764
And if it doesn't?

40:13.960 --> 40:15.610
Then we go to war.

40:37.199 --> 40:38.405
Is that Nomar Arcielo?

40:38.559 --> 40:39.561
Yes, sir.

40:39.719 --> 40:41.802
Agent Knox brought him in
for questioning last night.

40:43.519 --> 40:46.648
I can't believe
you kept the phone, Nomar.

40:46.840 --> 40:48.409
That was
incredibly stupid.

40:48.559 --> 40:50.369
You can't prove it's mine.

40:50.519 --> 40:51.760
Eight people
live in that place.

40:51.920 --> 40:54.126
Plus, you know, it's Latinos.

40:54.280 --> 40:56.362
We got a lot of cousins.

40:56.519 --> 40:58.648
Could belong to any of us.

40:58.800 --> 41:00.643
We know it's yours.

41:00.800 --> 41:02.961
Víbora Ruiz
had you arrange his meeting

41:03.119 --> 41:04.121
with Felipe Lobos.

41:04.280 --> 41:06.168
Yes, Nomar.

41:06.320 --> 41:07.400
That's why you're here.

41:07.559 --> 41:08.561
We don't want you.

41:08.719 --> 41:09.766
We don't even want your boss.

41:09.920 --> 41:11.206
We want Lobos.

41:12.519 --> 41:14.123
This is a list of all the numbers

41:14.320 --> 41:16.721
dialed and received by that phone.

41:17.719 --> 41:18.925
Your phone.

41:19.119 --> 41:21.043
Just tell me which numbers
belong to Lobos

41:21.199 --> 41:22.246
or his men.

41:22.400 --> 41:24.128
You want me
to rat on Felipe Lobos.

41:24.280 --> 41:26.123
I'd rather live
a couple more days.

41:26.280 --> 41:28.521
Days, how about years?

41:28.679 --> 41:29.726
I can have you
doing hard time

41:29.920 --> 41:31.489
in Leavenworth
by the end of the week.

41:31.639 --> 41:32.800
Getting fucked every day.

41:32.960 --> 41:34.485
An hour of sunlight
if you're lucky.

41:34.639 --> 41:37.563
I've been inside already.

41:37.760 --> 41:40.331
I was 19 and weak,
too small to fight them off.

41:40.480 --> 41:43.244
You get used to getting fucked.

41:43.400 --> 41:45.766
Makes you appreciate a woman.

41:45.920 --> 41:47.251
I'm a Soldado now.

41:47.440 --> 41:49.840
I'm more powerful inside
than I am out here.

41:50.000 --> 41:53.322
This is gonna take a little longer
than he thought.

41:53.480 --> 41:55.447
Why don't I give it a try?

42:01.800 --> 42:03.164
Can I have the room, please?

42:03.320 --> 42:04.400
I don't think that's
a good idea, Angie.

42:04.559 --> 42:06.561
- This is my suspect.
- I'll call you if I need you.

42:25.559 --> 42:28.608
I ran the numbers of the outgoing
calls you made.

42:28.760 --> 42:31.809
Mostly other burner cells,
other Soldados probably.

42:31.960 --> 42:34.485
And the numbers
that might be Lobos-related.

42:34.639 --> 42:37.405
But one of the numbers
you called is actually registered,

42:37.559 --> 42:38.606
you know which one?

42:38.760 --> 42:40.250
No.

42:40.400 --> 42:42.971
Your little secret you're hiding
from Ruiz.

42:43.159 --> 42:46.369
You've been calling Isabel,
his 14-year-old daughter.

42:46.519 --> 42:48.726
How could she know that?

42:48.920 --> 42:50.081
The numbers were
in my initial report,

42:50.239 --> 42:51.650
the evidence used
to get the warrant.

42:51.800 --> 42:53.847
You didn't cross-check them
with the Ruiz file?

42:54.920 --> 42:55.920
I guess she did.

42:56.079 --> 42:57.081
Like I told el blanco,

42:57.239 --> 42:58.684
the phone could have been
used by anybody.

42:58.840 --> 43:00.887
Maybe my cousin
met her at school.

43:01.039 --> 43:03.724
Could be, but who do you think
Ruiz is going to believe?

43:03.880 --> 43:04.880
You or me?

43:05.039 --> 43:07.041
Especially after
I show him this.

43:08.559 --> 43:10.960
That's bullshit!
That's a fucking fake!

43:28.280 --> 43:30.043
And when he lets
the Soldado Nation know

43:30.199 --> 43:34.762
you like to mess with little girls,
then we'll see what you get used to.

43:34.960 --> 43:37.690
Or you can tell me everything
you know about Lobos

43:37.880 --> 43:43.045
and your nasty pedophile bullshit
will stay our little secret.

43:49.920 --> 43:52.684
Just sign the agreement...

43:54.639 --> 43:56.164
here and here.

44:16.159 --> 44:17.161
Not bad.

45:06.480 --> 45:07.891
What the fuck?

45:52.239 --> 45:53.240
Whoever's fucking with us

45:53.400 --> 45:54.561
knows where they're hiding.

45:54.719 --> 45:55.721
They'll get the message
loud and clear.

45:55.880 --> 45:57.085
Two days of street chat
and people will know

45:57.239 --> 45:59.003
we're not the ones
to fuck with.

45:59.159 --> 46:00.445
And about the girl?

46:00.599 --> 46:01.885
Callin' J now.

46:07.199 --> 46:08.530
- Julio.
- Yeah?

46:08.679 --> 46:10.887
Get some flowers, man.

46:11.079 --> 46:12.969
You're going to the hospital.

46:13.159 --> 46:15.891
Where's room 1804?

46:16.079 --> 46:18.242
That way, sir.

46:24.880 --> 46:26.210
Can I see your I.D.?

47:12.880 --> 47:14.244
Nice work in there.

47:14.400 --> 47:17.210
Did Nomar really leave that
picture of the girl on his phone?

47:17.360 --> 47:19.043
I grabbed it
from a child porn case.

47:19.199 --> 47:21.601
It's not even Isabel.

47:21.760 --> 47:23.489
Good girl.

47:32.639 --> 47:34.244
Hello?

47:34.400 --> 47:35.925
You ain't seen fit
to call to say you weren't

47:36.119 --> 47:37.121
coming through last night?

47:37.280 --> 47:38.485
Jamie?

47:38.639 --> 47:40.641
Stand a brother up and pretend
not to know his voice?

47:40.800 --> 47:41.847
Okay.

47:43.159 --> 47:45.447
I'm sorry about last night.

47:45.599 --> 47:46.646
A work meeting came up.

47:46.840 --> 47:49.161
I just wanted to make sure
you're all right.

47:49.320 --> 47:51.322
How about I
make it up to you?

47:57.159 --> 48:00.164
He left about a half an hour ago.

48:00.320 --> 48:01.764
I wanted him
to take me to lunch.

48:01.920 --> 48:04.161
Did he say when
he'd be back?

48:04.360 --> 48:05.407
No.

48:05.559 --> 48:07.005
But he never does.

48:07.159 --> 48:08.525
You want me
to give him a call?

48:08.679 --> 48:11.603
No. I'll do it.

48:13.599 --> 48:15.523
I don't need an audience.

48:27.480 --> 48:29.800
Mrs. St. Patrick.

48:29.960 --> 48:31.563
Hey, you okay?

48:31.760 --> 48:32.760
I can't reach Ghost,

48:32.920 --> 48:35.206
and I'm starting to get worried.

48:35.360 --> 48:38.887
I've got eyes on Mr. St. Patrick
and he's just fine.

48:39.039 --> 48:41.407
Okay, guess I feel better, then.

48:43.119 --> 48:44.804
Shawn, could you do me a favor?

48:44.960 --> 48:46.724
Don't tell Ghost I called.

48:46.880 --> 48:48.449
He wouldn't like me
checking up on him.

48:48.599 --> 48:50.523
Can it be
our little secret?

48:52.119 --> 48:53.565
Yes, ma'am.

48:53.719 --> 48:55.722
Our little secret.

49:02.079 --> 49:03.809
Thanks for making it up to me,
big spender.

49:05.199 --> 49:07.088
You want the change?

49:07.239 --> 49:09.242
Promise not to spend it all
in one place?

49:11.559 --> 49:13.608
Wow.

49:13.800 --> 49:16.804
Haven't been here
in years.

49:16.960 --> 49:19.804
This was my favorite
field trip back in the day.

49:19.960 --> 49:22.929
They always put us on the bus
in alphabetical order, man.

49:23.079 --> 49:26.242
I had to work up a whole scheme
just to sit next to you.

49:27.760 --> 49:31.081
Jose Uribe always wanted
all my lunch money.

49:31.280 --> 49:32.565
So you didn't eat?

49:32.719 --> 49:33.721
Seriously?

49:33.880 --> 49:34.880
It was worth it.

49:39.199 --> 49:41.202
Come on.
Let's go inside and see the whale.

49:45.920 --> 49:47.001
Okay.

49:54.760 --> 49:56.000
Used to make me feel so small

49:56.159 --> 49:57.684
standing under here.

49:57.840 --> 49:59.045
Hmm.

49:59.199 --> 50:00.644
Thought I'd feel different
when I got older.

50:00.800 --> 50:03.280
Why don't you ask him?

50:03.440 --> 50:05.487
I guess some things
don't change.

50:06.679 --> 50:07.965
Well, I don't think
we'll get busted

50:08.119 --> 50:09.530
kissing in the stairwell
this time.

50:12.920 --> 50:14.967
I was so embarrassed
we got caught.

50:16.000 --> 50:17.809
I wasn't.

50:21.360 --> 50:23.487
I got you something.

50:23.639 --> 50:25.688
When you went
to get the map.

50:25.840 --> 50:27.443
One for each of us.

50:31.679 --> 50:34.603
You dared me I wouldn't boost
anything from the gift shop.

50:34.800 --> 50:36.608
Yeah, I ate those words,
didn't I?

50:36.800 --> 50:38.802
I bought them this time.

50:40.559 --> 50:41.846
This is great.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.001
Thank you.

50:53.519 --> 50:57.126
Look, Angie,
I can't stop thinking

50:57.320 --> 50:59.288
there must be a reason
you came in the club

50:59.440 --> 51:00.804
the other night.

51:00.960 --> 51:04.521
A reason we're seeing each other
again after all this time?

51:04.679 --> 51:06.681
Me being around you...

51:11.519 --> 51:14.045
Me being with you.

51:22.119 --> 51:23.724
It just feels right.

51:25.880 --> 51:27.847
I know.

51:28.840 --> 51:31.286
Me, too.

51:36.199 --> 51:38.088
Oh, fuck!

51:38.280 --> 51:40.043
My phone didn't ring.

51:40.239 --> 51:42.481
I gotta go, like, right now.

51:42.639 --> 51:46.086
Jamie, I'm sorry.

51:46.239 --> 51:47.570
I--

52:01.599 --> 52:02.681
Ghost call you?

52:02.840 --> 52:03.920
Yeah.

52:04.079 --> 52:05.889
How'd you do it without
setting off the machines?

52:06.039 --> 52:07.643
Hospitals are tricky.

52:07.800 --> 52:09.244
Do what?

52:09.400 --> 52:11.641
Boss told me to tell her
she was promoted.

52:13.079 --> 52:15.242
She's going to start working
markets in the bank.

52:16.440 --> 52:18.442
Yo, he didn't tell me
to ice a chick.

52:19.599 --> 52:21.329
Did I get it wrong?

52:21.480 --> 52:23.289
Nope.

52:28.480 --> 52:30.527
You ready
with those deposit slips?

52:34.079 --> 52:35.286
I don't like doing things
this way.

52:35.440 --> 52:37.601
But you get to keep your job
for one more day.

52:39.320 --> 52:40.481
It's a joke, man.

52:40.639 --> 52:42.608
Lighten up.

52:43.599 --> 52:45.443
Where's James?

52:46.639 --> 52:48.483
He's in the back.

52:49.519 --> 52:50.646
Should I get him?

52:51.920 --> 52:54.206
Nope.

53:33.320 --> 53:35.561
I am so sorry,
I just stepped out for some air.

53:37.480 --> 53:39.766
You scored major points
with Collins today.

53:39.920 --> 53:42.001
You're on his radar
in a big way.

53:42.159 --> 53:45.003
He wants you to come
to his poker night next weekend.

53:45.199 --> 53:46.804
Holder might be there.
He'll be in town.

53:46.960 --> 53:48.530
Holy shit.

53:48.679 --> 53:51.126
Thank you, Frankie,

53:51.280 --> 53:54.170
for the shot,
for the support.

53:54.320 --> 53:56.766
Totally justified.

53:56.960 --> 53:58.688
You owned that little shit
Saxe today.

53:58.880 --> 54:02.009
But if you really want to compete
with these guys,

54:02.159 --> 54:04.083
you can't have an outside life.

54:04.239 --> 54:07.130
They have wives,
they have families,

54:07.280 --> 54:08.360
but we can't.

54:08.519 --> 54:11.204
We gotta be available 24/7.

54:11.360 --> 54:12.724
You can't have kids.

54:12.880 --> 54:16.362
Because the one time
you pick your baby over your case,

54:16.559 --> 54:19.210
some asshole like Saxe
gets your shot.

54:19.400 --> 54:21.164
So what he's a dick?

54:21.360 --> 54:23.327
You weren't there.

54:23.480 --> 54:26.563
Today, Collins came back
after lunch

54:26.719 --> 54:28.960
to invite you
to poker personally.

54:29.159 --> 54:30.809
You were M.I.A.

54:30.960 --> 54:33.201
I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

54:33.360 --> 54:34.885
Oh, I know it won't.

54:35.079 --> 54:37.320
I know your file, Angela.

54:37.480 --> 54:39.960
I know where you came from.

54:40.119 --> 54:42.726
And I know how hard
you worked to get here.

54:42.920 --> 54:45.923
The stakes are even higher now.

54:46.079 --> 54:47.844
Whoever he is,

54:48.000 --> 54:51.367
he's not worth blowing
your shot

54:51.519 --> 54:53.601
There's no man,
Frankie.

54:56.079 --> 54:57.922
Sure, Angela.

55:45.519 --> 55:47.920
Hey, Mrs. St. Patrick,
what are you doing here?

55:48.079 --> 55:49.764
I need a ride home.

55:51.639 --> 55:54.722
And when we're alone,
you can call me Tasha.

56:56.360 --> 56:58.362
It's okay, it's okay.

57:01.039 --> 57:03.041
Daddy's here.

57:03.199 --> 57:05.407
It's okay, Yasmine.

57:05.559 --> 57:08.483
Daddy's here.
