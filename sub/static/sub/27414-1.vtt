WEBVTT

01:17.680 --> 01:19.080
Can you breathe?

01:19.160 --> 01:20.200
Yeah.

01:20.760 --> 01:22.600
Shame, that. Turn around.

01:29.280 --> 01:30.680
MAN: Babylon beast!

01:32.520 --> 01:33.880
You're a lying pig, Luther.

01:35.320 --> 01:36.880
You ain't no better than me.

01:37.640 --> 01:39.400
-Get me out!

01:50.360 --> 01:51.680
MAN: Whatever you are!

02:05.760 --> 02:07.640
-See you SOON. Bye.
-Bye.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.120
-Take care.
-Bye.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.640
PECK: Wait! Miss.

03:00.160 --> 03:01.520
Miss! It's Lee Peck.

03:01.600 --> 03:03.960
You taught me in English.

03:04.040 --> 03:06.040
-Sorry, Miss.

03:06.440 --> 03:08.000
Did I just scare you?

03:08.320 --> 03:09.720
Yeah, you did. Yeah.

03:09.800 --> 03:12.040
Miss, I'm sorry...

03:12.160 --> 03:13.760
Go home, Lee.

03:49.440 --> 03:50.440
What?

03:55.400 --> 03:56.720
Oh, sh...

04:00.600 --> 04:02.760
Miss! Miss, let me in!

04:04.720 --> 04:08.120
Miss. Miss, just let me in yeah?

04:09.600 --> 04:12.880
Miss! Miss! Let me in, Miss.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.480
Miss, let me in.

04:14.560 --> 04:16.640
-Lee, go home.
-Miss, please!

04:16.720 --> 04:18.160
-I'm calling the police.

04:18.240 --> 04:20.120
-Miss, please...
-I'm doing it right now, Lee.

05:55.800 --> 05:57.200
I'll get you fixed up, honest.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.440
All right, all right, all right.
Hold on.

06:02.520 --> 06:03.960
Just relax, all right? Don't... Don't!

06:04.040 --> 06:05.160
-MAN: Cuff him!

06:09.480 --> 06:10.480
Take him.

06:37.280 --> 06:38.880
LUTHER:  Oh, God!

06:46.880 --> 06:49.960
George, what is all this bollocks?

06:51.400 --> 06:52.560
Where is he?

06:53.440 --> 06:54.440
Where is who?

07:00.000 --> 07:01.080
Fuck off.

07:07.720 --> 07:09.440
I don't know who you're talking about.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.360
That's my son.

07:20.760 --> 07:22.600
-Alastair.
-Alastair, yes.

07:22.680 --> 07:24.520
The elder one. Washes...

07:24.960 --> 07:26.800
Washes the money for you, yeah.
What about him?

07:26.920 --> 07:29.520
Allegedly. Okey-dokey.

07:30.120 --> 07:32.040
-Massey, please.

07:32.120 --> 07:33.760
So, what we're gonna do is...

07:34.160 --> 07:39.040
I'm gonna ask that question
a maximum of five more times.

07:43.960 --> 07:47.120
-Cornelius, I've no...

07:47.200 --> 07:50.240
Where's my boy? Come on, John.
Hurry up. Where is he?

07:50.320 --> 07:51.320
I have no clue.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.320
-And that's twice.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.720
All right. I don't know. I don't know.

07:57.800 --> 07:59.840
Last chance. Come on. Wake up, John.

08:10.120 --> 08:11.880
-Give me that.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.400
Put your hands where I can see 'em.

08:16.440 --> 08:17.800
So, what's going on?

08:17.960 --> 08:21.080
-No, I really don't know.

08:23.520 --> 08:27.360
Where was he when he got taken?
Alastair Who was it?

08:27.440 --> 08:29.240
Ah, see, now you're fishing.

08:30.520 --> 08:33.520
Well, if you tell me who did it
then I might be able to help you.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.960
I'm not a 12-year-old girl.
I take care of my own business.

08:36.040 --> 08:37.480
You started this, George!

08:37.560 --> 08:41.560
I'm just doing due diligence,
making sure you're not part of it.

08:41.640 --> 08:42.880
What'd you say?

08:42.960 --> 08:44.960
Part of it

08:50.960 --> 08:53.280
-We've got history.
-Not that kind of history.

08:53.360 --> 08:56.640
Says the bloke who kidnapped me
and cuffed me to a radiator.

08:58.560 --> 08:59.840
Yeah, fair dues.

09:05.400 --> 09:06.760
He's my boy, John.

09:06.840 --> 09:08.640
Do me a favour, let me get on with it.

09:08.720 --> 09:13.040
George. I don't care about you
and I don't care about your boy.

09:13.480 --> 09:15.240
All I care about is going home.

09:16.400 --> 09:17.480
Leave me alone.

09:18.360 --> 09:20.440
Tell the Spice Girls
to back off as well.

10:43.640 --> 10:45.480
DCI Luther.

10:46.240 --> 10:47.800
I'll put the kettle on, shall I?

10:56.000 --> 10:57.240
I see you're settling in.

10:57.320 --> 11:01.480
Yeah. Yes, of course.
Listen, uh... Milk's in the fridge.

11:01.560 --> 11:03.720
You know where everything is.
I'll be back in a second.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.480
So... How's Catherine working out?

11:52.320 --> 11:53.640
DS Halliday?

11:54.600 --> 11:57.200
She's okay, I suppose. Why do you ask?

11:57.600 --> 11:58.640
You don't like her?

12:01.360 --> 12:03.280
Oh, it's not that. I'm...

12:03.360 --> 12:06.320
Look, John, this,
uh, direct entry thing...

12:06.400 --> 12:08.400
Head-hunting people
from the public sector,

12:08.480 --> 12:09.880
fast-tracking them through the ranks...

12:09.960 --> 12:11.880
None of us like it,
but that's the way it is.

12:13.160 --> 12:17.520
Give it 10 minutes and DS Halliday
will be Superintendent Halliday.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.080
Boss, are you, um,
telling me to behave myself?

12:22.520 --> 12:27.400
I'm saying that we're the dinosaurs
and she's the meteor.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
So, yes.

12:29.760 --> 12:31.360
Don't show her how it's done.

12:32.200 --> 12:34.200
Show her how it's supposed to be done.

12:36.720 --> 12:38.440
-Noted.
-Good.

12:39.520 --> 12:40.720
-I hope so.

12:40.800 --> 12:43.240
-It is so. Luther.

12:44.800 --> 12:46.800
All right. We're on our way.

12:47.960 --> 12:49.480
Think we gotta go somewhere, boss.

13:14.200 --> 13:15.200
LUTHER: DS Halliday.

13:16.120 --> 13:17.120
Morning.

13:18.640 --> 13:19.640
Morning.

13:23.520 --> 13:26.320
-Yeah, sure.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.920
The killer took his eyes
and cut his tongue out.

13:41.480 --> 13:42.480
All right.

13:43.400 --> 13:44.680
Keep it.

13:45.200 --> 13:48.240
-No, I couldn't. It's a lovely pen.
-Honestly. It's my gift to you.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Thanks.

13:51.200 --> 13:53.880
The killer chased him from
Ballarat Street just around the corner.

13:58.160 --> 13:59.160
All right.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.400
Um, can I ask... Um, is...

14:06.400 --> 14:08.000
Is this normal?

14:09.200 --> 14:10.200
Normal?

14:24.160 --> 14:25.160
Thanks.

14:29.320 --> 14:31.080
Witness hasn't a clue
as to what happened.

14:32.120 --> 14:36.440
The victim's an ex-pupil, Lee Peck.
He followed her home.

14:36.520 --> 14:39.200
Next thing she knows,
he's banging on her door,

14:39.280 --> 14:40.480
pleading to be let in.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.440
Seems like the killer came from nowhere.

14:43.920 --> 14:45.520
SCHENK: I would like
to talk to the witness.

15:32.640 --> 15:33.640
Benny.

15:34.800 --> 15:39.000
Mate, um... I need a favour.

15:39.440 --> 15:41.120
An off-the-books type favour.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.400
Oh, yeah? I thought
we're behaving ourselves these days.

15:43.480 --> 15:45.600
No, we are. It won't be a problem.

15:45.680 --> 15:46.680
Says who?

15:47.200 --> 15:48.520
Well, then. What do you need?

15:49.280 --> 15:51.400
Someone's got George Cornelius
on the hook.

15:51.480 --> 15:53.480
All right? I need to find out who it is.

15:53.600 --> 15:54.600
Why do we care?

15:57.320 --> 15:59.000
I don't know. I, um...

16:00.680 --> 16:01.920
It just doesn't feel right.

16:02.640 --> 16:05.040
So, I'm just gonna have
a little nose about,

16:05.120 --> 16:08.880
and not fuss with warrants
or anything like that?

16:09.000 --> 16:10.720
No, no, no, no.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.560
Go on, then. You talked me into it,
you silver-tongued devil.

16:24.120 --> 16:25.120
Cheers.

16:32.040 --> 16:33.200
All right. So, where are we?

16:33.600 --> 16:35.880
SCHENK: First victim's Paul Redford,

16:35.960 --> 16:38.000
29, landscape gardener.

16:38.080 --> 16:41.000
-Single and ready to mingle.

16:41.080 --> 16:43.720
Oh, he used a number
of online hook-up sites.

16:43.800 --> 16:46.920
SCHENK: Oh, let's hope we're not looking
at another Steven Port.

16:47.080 --> 16:49.760
HALLIDAY: Lab's looking for GHB
and other drugs.

16:49.840 --> 16:53.320
But Port, he liked to incapacitate,
rape and then murder his victims.

16:53.400 --> 16:55.000
He didn't do anything like this.

16:55.080 --> 16:58.080
-No, nothing close.

16:59.320 --> 17:01.720
All right. Well, you know,
this isn't our boy's first disco.

17:01.800 --> 17:04.560
I mean, even Jack the Ripper
had to work up

17:04.640 --> 17:07.240
towards what he did to Mary Jane Kelly.

17:07.320 --> 17:10.760
And our boy hasn't got to this place
from a standing start.

17:11.600 --> 17:12.600
Nope.

17:13.480 --> 17:15.000
Okay, first up, um...

17:15.080 --> 17:19.200
Let's see if there's an up tick
on people being assaulted in public.

17:19.480 --> 17:23.120
Stabbed in the groin, the buttocks
with a pen-knife or big pin...

17:23.200 --> 17:24.200
Like a hat pin.

17:25.600 --> 17:27.440
-A hat pin.

17:27.600 --> 17:31.200
It's like a long pin, um,
like, this big. You can use it for...

17:31.560 --> 17:32.560
I've seen those.

17:33.920 --> 17:37.400
And then let's check, uh,
recent prison releases

17:37.480 --> 17:39.960
of men that generally fit the pattern.

17:40.440 --> 17:41.640
What about the other victim?

17:42.000 --> 17:43.920
-HALLIDAY: Uh, no.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.080
It looks like an acute case
of wrong place, wrong time.

17:47.520 --> 17:48.520
Hmm.

17:49.080 --> 17:52.720
What does this say to you,
the eyes and the tongue?

17:53.080 --> 17:54.920
HALLIDAY: Uh, symbolic punishment?

17:56.120 --> 17:57.120
For what?

17:57.200 --> 18:00.000
Intruding on a private act, maybe?

18:02.960 --> 18:05.200
And this business, how has he done that?

18:06.000 --> 18:10.080
That's LEDs sewn into his hood,
it confuses CCTV.

18:10.160 --> 18:12.320
LUTHER: Ah, okay.
So, this isn't random, is it?

18:13.600 --> 18:16.440
Which means there's gonna be more.

19:11.520 --> 19:12.720
MAN ON SPEAKER: Couldn't keep them out.

19:12.840 --> 19:14.360
Nowhere near it.

19:14.440 --> 19:15.600
Yeah, man. Yeah, man.

19:18.600 --> 19:19.920
Yeah. Who's this?

19:20.000 --> 19:21.440
-It is I, Krampus.

19:21.520 --> 19:25.280
The half goat, half demon creature
who punishes naughty children.

19:25.360 --> 19:26.680
Bad time. What's up?

19:26.760 --> 19:29.840
-Listen, mate. I need a favour.
-Of course. Totally.

19:29.920 --> 19:31.520
Seriously?
-No.

19:31.600 --> 19:33.360
Then you leave me no alternative,

19:33.440 --> 19:37.200
but to huff and puff
and blow your walls down.

19:38.200 --> 19:39.600
How are you gonna do that, then?

19:39.680 --> 19:41.840
By telling Mr Cornelius
that you're on the skim.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.800
Well, I haven't.

19:46.880 --> 19:49.560
And that's mad because he'd kill anyone
who did something like that.

19:49.640 --> 19:51.280
How do you even know this shit?

19:51.360 --> 19:55.680
Big lad, you need to brush up
on your online security. Hmm.

20:23.840 --> 20:24.840
Benny?

20:26.200 --> 20:27.200
Yeah.

20:27.280 --> 20:29.920
Oh, cool. Nice one. All right.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.640
All right, um...

20:31.720 --> 20:33.760
If anything comes up,
you let me know, okay?

20:33.840 --> 20:35.640
Okay, sure. Um, cool. Where will you be?

20:35.720 --> 20:38.240
-Out.
-Yep. Cool. Sure.

20:55.720 --> 20:56.720
Errol.

20:57.360 --> 21:00.040
If they catch me wearing this,
I'm dead about 18 times.

21:00.480 --> 21:01.920
He'll feed me to his dogs.

21:02.480 --> 21:05.040
-I'm not joking.
-Well, don't get caught, then.

21:05.640 --> 21:06.800
Actual dogs.

21:06.880 --> 21:08.840
He's got dogs, like them '70s dogs.

21:08.920 --> 21:10.200
-Errol...
-Dobermanns.

21:10.280 --> 21:12.720
I just need to know
what's going on, all right? That's it.

21:12.800 --> 21:14.680
I don't even know anything. Huh?

21:14.760 --> 21:17.440
He just wants me there for a bit
of extra va-va-voom. That's all.

21:17.520 --> 21:19.240
I'm numbers, mate. I'm muscle.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.640
I just need you in the room, listening.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.680
Don't say nothing,
don't go asking any questions,

21:25.760 --> 21:27.400
just let us listen.

21:42.600 --> 21:46.160
Everyone, keep your wig on. Keep schtum.

21:56.880 --> 21:57.920
Afternoon.

21:59.280 --> 22:01.000
CORNELIUS: Look, we all want the money,

22:01.080 --> 22:04.120
but my son has nothing to do with this.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.720
It's not how we do things
in the civilised world.

22:08.760 --> 22:10.200
Or what's left of it.

22:12.040 --> 22:13.280
All right, all right.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.960
You get your money. I get my boy.

22:16.040 --> 22:17.120
And that's it.

22:17.200 --> 22:19.680
I'll meet you there. Close of play.

22:21.320 --> 22:22.320
Right.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.360
I want this place watched.

22:26.440 --> 22:28.120
Like a hen-night in Saudi.

22:30.560 --> 22:32.000
All right, off we toddle.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.200
Are you all right, Errol?
You're looking a bit peaky.

22:40.680 --> 22:43.160
ERROL: No, I'm good, George.

22:44.560 --> 22:45.560
CORNELIUS: Really?

22:46.320 --> 22:48.760
You're coming across as a bit clammy,
to be honest.

22:50.520 --> 22:54.640
Yeah, uh, just... Just sweaty.
It's a family thing.

22:54.720 --> 22:56.600
On my mum's side.

22:57.080 --> 22:59.280
CORNELIUS:  Delightful.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.120
Somebody point a gun
into Errol's face, please.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.160
Just one.

23:07.720 --> 23:08.920
Oh, mate.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.040
Do me a favour, Errol. Lift your shirt.

23:16.480 --> 23:19.920
Oh, you don't have to bend over, mate.
Just lift your shirt.

23:22.600 --> 23:23.800
I can't do that.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.520
-Stop. All right. All right.
-CORNELIUS: Fair enough.

23:27.760 --> 23:29.040
-ERROL: Bloody hell.

23:35.480 --> 23:36.520
Hello, hello, hello.

23:37.080 --> 23:38.520
What's all this?

23:39.000 --> 23:40.200
Oh, the German.

23:40.280 --> 23:43.120
I suppose this goes to show
you really don't have a scooby

23:43.200 --> 23:44.200
about what's going on.

23:45.240 --> 23:47.720
But you're still curious,
me little tinker.

23:49.320 --> 23:50.640
So, here's what we do.

23:50.720 --> 23:52.760
You can follow me if you like.

23:53.480 --> 23:57.040
Or you can save poor old Errol here.

24:03.200 --> 24:05.760
Remember what happened to Harry Samson.

24:23.480 --> 24:24.880
What happened to Harry Samson?

24:27.800 --> 24:29.400
BENNY: What did happen to Harry Samson?

24:32.240 --> 24:35.280
LUTHER: Harry Samson.
They blew his head off.

24:35.400 --> 24:36.880
So, where do you think
they're taking him?

24:36.960 --> 24:38.800
Somewhere quiet, privacy,

24:38.880 --> 24:40.880
a bit of distance,
a bit of real estate, where...

24:47.200 --> 24:48.560
Where would they go?
Where would they go?

24:48.640 --> 24:49.840
Come on. Come on, John.

24:54.360 --> 24:56.720
No, no, no, no.

24:56.800 --> 24:58.240
-Come on!

25:22.880 --> 25:23.880
Hello.

25:26.120 --> 25:27.120
Police.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.800
ERROL:  Come on, man!

25:47.040 --> 25:50.080
What What is it?

25:56.840 --> 25:59.200
Ten minutes?
What happens in ten minutes?

26:00.320 --> 26:02.680
-It goes off.
-No. No!

26:03.840 --> 26:05.800
-The key.
-Wait, wait. No. You can't do that.

26:05.880 --> 26:07.120
-Hey! Wait!

26:19.960 --> 26:21.280
LUTHER: Minty, where are you?

26:22.600 --> 26:24.720
I've got this...
This thing around my neck.

26:24.800 --> 26:26.440
This metal thing. I think it's a bomb.

26:26.520 --> 26:28.520
-LUTHER: Minty, calm down.
-I can't calm down.

26:29.120 --> 26:31.000
-I've got this thing around my neck!
-Relax.

26:31.080 --> 26:33.040
We lost you at 10 Cory Road.

26:33.120 --> 26:35.560
-We turned on Brandon Street.

26:35.640 --> 26:37.960
-I think, then... Then, uh...

26:38.040 --> 26:40.000
All right. Okay, okay.
I know where he is.

26:43.080 --> 26:45.080
Benny... Benny!

26:46.080 --> 26:47.080
Benny!

26:55.320 --> 26:56.320
Benny!

26:57.520 --> 26:59.680
-Miss Halliday.

27:00.800 --> 27:02.160
Um, tip line got a call

27:02.240 --> 27:05.840
from a consultant psychiatrist,
a Dr Vivien Lake.

27:05.920 --> 27:08.840
She's worried about one
of the patients, "escalating risk."

27:08.920 --> 27:10.240
Okay, do you like him for it?

27:10.320 --> 27:11.880
I dunno. It sounds interesting.

27:11.960 --> 27:14.200
-Well, excellent, bring her in.
-I know, I've already sent a car.

27:14.280 --> 27:16.200
Good. Okay, as soon as I can,
I'll be back.

27:16.280 --> 27:17.280
Yeah.

27:18.320 --> 27:19.960
What's he doing up, by the way?

27:20.120 --> 27:22.040
-Minty!

27:22.120 --> 27:24.960
-You better be alone.
-Yeah, yeah, I'm alone. Come on, man!

27:25.040 --> 27:27.440
Come on. Go, go, go.

27:27.520 --> 27:28.600
All right, let's have a look.

27:28.680 --> 27:30.480
-Go, go, go, go. Oh, God.
-Just shut up. Just shut up.

27:30.840 --> 27:32.720
-Shh.
-ERROL: Come on, man!

27:32.800 --> 27:34.320
-I can't help you, man.
No.

27:34.400 --> 27:36.320
Wait, wait, wait. There's a key.
He threw the key over there.

27:36.400 --> 27:38.600
-Over there in the corner.

27:38.680 --> 27:39.880
Benny, you have a quick look.

27:41.400 --> 27:43.440
Come on. Come on, man.

27:44.080 --> 27:45.280
-Come on!
-Just relax.

27:45.360 --> 27:47.360
All right.

27:48.760 --> 27:50.000
-Come on.
-I don't think I can open this.

27:50.080 --> 27:51.320
Yeah, man, you can do it.

27:51.400 --> 27:52.800
-I'm not gonna be able to...
-Yes, you can do it.

27:52.880 --> 27:53.960
No lock's unpickable.

27:54.040 --> 27:56.960
-This might be. It's pick-resistant.

27:57.040 --> 27:58.960
It means I can't pick it, Minty, relax.

27:59.040 --> 28:00.400
Of course, you can open it.
Of course you can.

28:00.480 --> 28:02.240
That's not the attitude. Pick it.
Get the job done.

28:02.360 --> 28:04.640
-Come on!

28:05.360 --> 28:07.080
I swear to God, I can't see it.

28:07.160 --> 28:09.600
-In the corner!

28:09.680 --> 28:13.000
Corner, corner, corner... Hurry up!
Hurry up.

28:13.080 --> 28:15.360
Oh, my God. Oh, come on, man.

28:15.800 --> 28:16.800
Come on!

28:17.600 --> 28:20.240
Just relax.
All right!

28:30.240 --> 28:31.240
LUTHER: Benny?

28:31.880 --> 28:34.720
What's that
What's that look?

28:34.800 --> 28:35.800
What does that look mean?

28:35.880 --> 28:37.040
-Yeah.

28:37.120 --> 28:39.160
-You should go.
-Come on, come on, come on!

28:39.320 --> 28:41.160
LUTHER: Start moving!
ERROL: Find the key!

28:41.240 --> 28:43.440
-Find the key!
-Oh, I've got it.

28:43.520 --> 28:44.840
Look, he's got it. He's got it.

28:45.600 --> 28:47.160
-Come on!
-Go, go. Right there.

28:47.240 --> 28:49.480
Open it, open it. Unlock it.

28:49.960 --> 28:50.960
Come on, come on.

28:54.440 --> 28:55.640
Yes, yes!

28:57.000 --> 28:58.040
All right. Come on.

29:01.640 --> 29:02.640
In there!

30:00.880 --> 30:01.880
LUTHER: Errol.

30:04.040 --> 30:07.400
I'll make sure you're looked after
until this is all put to bed, all right?

30:08.600 --> 30:10.440
It won't be put to bed, though, will it?

30:11.200 --> 30:12.760
You've opened up a can of...

30:14.040 --> 30:17.120
Not worms. I don't know, geese.

30:22.440 --> 30:23.720
I'll sort it.

30:24.640 --> 30:26.960
-I promise.
-Yeah. Yeah, you do that.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.040
Because everyone knows
you do magic, yeah?

30:50.880 --> 30:53.480
Yeah, you run.

30:54.400 --> 30:55.840
I'll find you.

30:57.200 --> 30:58.440
I'll get you.

31:10.880 --> 31:13.240
Dr Lake, I'm DCI Luther.

31:13.320 --> 31:16.080
-Yeah, they have. Thanks.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.320
HALLIDAY: Um...

31:18.800 --> 31:22.160
You wanted to bring one of your patients
to our attention.

31:22.240 --> 31:23.600
James Hauser, yeah.

31:23.680 --> 31:25.400
So, what can you tell us?

31:25.800 --> 31:27.200
He's a very troubled man.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Dealing with a number
of intersecting paraphilias,

31:30.080 --> 31:34.440
he was the victim of profound
and systematic childhood abuse.

31:34.520 --> 31:36.200
Unspeakable abuse, really.

31:37.240 --> 31:41.080
HALLIDAY: And to avoid any doubt,
um, paraphilia means...

31:41.160 --> 31:44.440
Sexual fetishes,
abnormal sexual impulses.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.760
-The nature of his...

31:46.840 --> 31:49.520
Piquerism.
From the French piquer, "to prick."

31:50.000 --> 31:53.160
At the age of 13, he stabbed a classmate
in the buttocks with a school compass,

31:53.280 --> 31:54.800
and experienced his first orgasm.

31:56.600 --> 31:58.600
-Male.

31:58.720 --> 31:59.920
He attended boarding school,

32:00.000 --> 32:03.400
but there were female victims
during his student days,

32:03.480 --> 32:06.160
and later, sex workers
of both sexes and genders.

32:06.240 --> 32:08.680
He paid to stab them in the buttocks,

32:08.760 --> 32:11.400
thighs, particularly the area
around the navel.

32:11.480 --> 32:14.240
-LUTHER: Using a...
-Usually the point of a scalpel.

32:15.200 --> 32:16.400
Just the tip.

32:20.360 --> 32:24.120
There isn't a person in the world
without a sexual secret. DS...

32:25.440 --> 32:26.640
Uh, Halliday.

32:26.720 --> 32:29.400
You know, we all have a fantasy.
We all have a fetish.

32:30.680 --> 32:32.680
We all regret something we've done.

32:33.400 --> 32:35.360
Something we never had
the courage to do.

32:36.160 --> 32:38.800
So, what's changed

32:38.880 --> 32:40.480
His condition's been escalating.

32:40.880 --> 32:42.880
He hasn't made
his last couple of appointments.

32:42.960 --> 32:47.160
And last night, he turned up
at my house uninvited.

32:47.240 --> 32:48.240
He...

32:49.120 --> 32:51.120
-There was blood on him.

32:52.600 --> 32:54.640
I presumed so, at first, yes.

32:54.720 --> 32:59.160
Self mutilation isn't uncommon in people
struggling with extreme desire. But...

32:59.680 --> 33:02.200
I went to wash his wounds.
There were no wounds.

33:03.400 --> 33:04.840
I asked him to wait in the lounge

33:04.920 --> 33:08.040
while I went into my office to call
the police to take him to a safe place.

33:09.200 --> 33:11.080
Before I could place the call,
he'd gone.

33:11.800 --> 33:13.560
He's not answering his phone or e-mails,

33:13.640 --> 33:17.600
so I decided to seek the advice
of a colleague and come forward.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.200
As his fantasies became more extreme,

33:21.280 --> 33:23.840
he became too ashamed
to articulate them.

33:24.400 --> 33:27.400
So, I asked
if he could draw them for me.

33:49.720 --> 33:51.000
Freeze. Nobody move.

38:34.320 --> 38:35.440
Stop the bus!

39:07.600 --> 39:08.600
Cheers.

39:12.920 --> 39:14.160
We think it's him.

39:15.280 --> 39:16.960
HALLIDAY: The driver tried to intervene.

39:17.800 --> 39:19.440
We're going after him with full force.

39:19.520 --> 39:21.560
We've got aerial units,
ground units, dogs.

39:21.640 --> 39:23.160
We've got his house, his workplace,

39:23.240 --> 39:24.960
all of his usual haunts
under surveillance.

39:27.120 --> 39:28.960
-Are you...
-Yeah, I'm fine.

39:29.280 --> 39:30.840
You're not fine. Nobody is.

39:32.480 --> 39:33.480
No, I'm fine.

39:36.280 --> 39:39.120
Well, good. He's not going home, is he?
I mean, not now.

39:39.200 --> 39:42.520
It's not gonna stop. Not after this.
Not until we stop him.

39:43.280 --> 39:44.560
HALLIDAY: So, what next?

39:45.080 --> 39:46.200
Now, we play dirty.

39:47.600 --> 39:50.680
The psychiatrist.
Did she seem normal to you?

39:51.080 --> 39:53.640
I don't know. I guess
she came across a bit intense,

39:53.720 --> 39:55.880
a bit too invested in her patient.

39:56.240 --> 39:58.360
Well, she did come forward
with his name.

39:58.440 --> 40:01.000
Yeah, but reluctantly.
'Cause I think she had to.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.400
I don't know how deep it goes,

40:03.480 --> 40:07.440
but I don't think we're looking
at a normal doctor-patient relationship.

40:07.520 --> 40:10.800
Well, it does happen sometimes
between patients and their therapists,

40:10.880 --> 40:13.520
they call it countertransference.
It can get intense.

40:13.600 --> 40:14.600
LUTHER: Ah, good.

40:14.680 --> 40:17.440
Whatever psycho-sexual thing
they got going on, we can exploit it.

40:17.520 --> 40:21.000
-Within parameters.

40:22.640 --> 40:26.160
Okay. Bring her in. Push her buttons.
See what pops up.

40:31.280 --> 40:33.400
HALLIDAY: Have you done this before?

40:33.480 --> 40:35.640
LUTHER: Yeah. Well, something like this.

40:35.720 --> 40:38.560
And you're definitely okay with it?
Like, ethically?

40:38.960 --> 40:40.160
I don't know about ethically,

40:40.240 --> 40:42.200
but as long as it's legal,
I'm okay with it.

40:43.240 --> 40:44.280
Okay.

40:46.640 --> 40:49.840
Dr Lake, we're sorry
to have to do this to you,

40:49.920 --> 40:52.400
but we urgently need to know
the whereabouts of your patient,

40:52.480 --> 40:54.400
and we believe you might be able
to help us with that.

40:54.480 --> 40:56.600
Has he been in contact with you
since we last spoke?

40:56.680 --> 40:57.680
No.

40:57.760 --> 40:59.360
And do you have any idea
where he might be,

40:59.440 --> 41:01.920
-Well, I'm hardly his keeper.

41:02.000 --> 41:05.560
Uh, no. No. But you do have
a responsibility to him.

41:05.800 --> 41:09.000
Which I believe I exercised
by coming forward.

41:35.560 --> 41:36.560
BENNY: Boss.

41:40.400 --> 41:44.400
James Houser's phone's just come on.
He's in Hampstead woods.

41:46.640 --> 41:47.640
This is Schenk.

41:47.720 --> 41:50.880
Get a CO19 to Hampstead woods
and have them take up position.

41:51.600 --> 41:53.840
HALLIDAY:  And what about
your responsibility to his victims?

41:53.920 --> 41:57.840
Well, I'd imagine it's "alleged victims"
at this stage, isn't it?

42:00.040 --> 42:02.800
Okay. Why don't you just show her?

42:10.640 --> 42:13.520
Well, this really is a tawdry form
of manipulation, isn't it?

42:13.600 --> 42:15.080
Frankly, I expected better.

42:15.160 --> 42:16.640
Dr Lake, look...

42:17.960 --> 42:19.000
You know him.

42:19.080 --> 42:20.560
I care about his well-being, yeah,

42:20.640 --> 42:22.440
but I have
no emotional attachment to him.

42:22.520 --> 42:24.280
-LUTHER: Which is a good thing.

42:24.960 --> 42:27.000
I don't think he's gonna stop
until we kill him.

42:30.440 --> 42:32.560
Oh, dear God, how clear can I be? Look.

42:33.560 --> 42:35.200
I'm happy to give you any information

42:35.280 --> 42:38.160
that might help in protecting
the lives of others, but...

42:38.640 --> 42:40.880
It's your job to actually catch him.

42:41.560 --> 42:45.160
I cannot, and I will not
help you do that.

42:45.400 --> 42:49.480
HALLIDAY: That girl on the bus
was 23 years old.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.280
Now, I could tell you
exactly what he did to her,

42:52.360 --> 42:55.080
before he slit the bus driver's throat
and ran away,

42:55.160 --> 42:57.360
but I don't wanna hear myself
saying those things.

42:57.640 --> 42:58.880
Do you understand that?

42:59.400 --> 43:01.080
I don't wanna hear myself
saying the things

43:01.160 --> 43:02.520
that your patient did in there.

43:02.600 --> 43:05.960
Well, look, I'm happy to suggest
a good therapist, if that's any help.

43:07.160 --> 43:08.720
And what if we were to arrest you?

43:09.920 --> 43:12.360
-Obstructing justice.

43:12.440 --> 43:13.760
Okay, um...

43:14.800 --> 43:17.080
Call me if you change your mind.

43:18.600 --> 43:19.600
Come on.

43:24.320 --> 43:27.320
Oh, God. So, it turns out I'm not fine.

43:30.360 --> 43:32.880
LUTHER: All right, look,
she's not gonna help voluntarily, okay?

43:32.960 --> 43:35.840
She's good and spooked on his behalf,
you guys listening in?

43:36.240 --> 43:37.920
BENNY: I am,
and you're bang on the money.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.320
He's talking to her right now.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.320
-SCHENK: Hampstead Woods.

43:42.400 --> 43:44.440
Seventy acres of open woodland.

43:44.520 --> 43:46.400
Multiple points of ingress and egress.

43:46.600 --> 43:49.200
If he gives us the slip there,
we'll never find him again, John,

43:49.280 --> 43:51.040
so we need her to lead us to him.

43:51.360 --> 43:53.000
Yeah, I know, she's good and primed.

43:53.080 --> 43:55.080
She thinks she's saving him
from the filth.

43:55.160 --> 43:57.240
She could be right.

43:59.400 --> 44:03.400
VIVIEN: James, remember,
you can control this.

44:04.480 --> 44:06.000
You have to think ahead.

44:06.720 --> 44:08.520
You have to think of the consequences.

44:14.040 --> 44:16.760
-I don't think I can stop.
-Yes, you can.

44:16.840 --> 44:18.080
You can.

44:18.520 --> 44:20.640
You need to remember what we discussed.

44:21.800 --> 44:23.320
You need to remember your strategies.

44:23.400 --> 44:25.480
You didn't call me
because you were aroused,

44:25.560 --> 44:27.200
you called me because you know

44:27.280 --> 44:29.440
you shouldn't be putting yourself
in this situation.

44:30.280 --> 44:32.320
You need to remember
what we talked about.

44:34.480 --> 44:35.680
Can you come here?

44:37.520 --> 44:38.680
Can you do that?

44:40.920 --> 44:41.920
Now?

44:45.360 --> 44:48.240
James, if you don't let me help you,
they're going to hurt you.

44:48.600 --> 44:50.560
And I couldn't bear that, so, please.

44:51.800 --> 44:53.120
Let me come to you.

44:53.880 --> 44:55.080
I'll hide you.

44:56.280 --> 44:57.440
I'll keep you safe.

44:59.760 --> 45:00.760
Please.

45:03.520 --> 45:04.880
JAMES: Hampstead Wood.

45:19.520 --> 45:20.520
She's leaving.

45:25.800 --> 45:28.240
And the CO19 are in position.

45:28.400 --> 45:30.880
-SCHENK: Stay with her.
-Two minutes away.

45:33.120 --> 45:34.320
You want him dead?

45:35.880 --> 45:37.520
I don't care. I just want him.

46:00.240 --> 46:03.080
BENNY: She's entering the woods
just south of the basketball court.

46:42.800 --> 46:43.800
James?

46:45.000 --> 46:46.320
Come with me, please.

46:50.440 --> 46:51.760
You can hurt me, if you like.

47:00.240 --> 47:01.240
All units.

47:02.200 --> 47:03.280
SCHENK: On my signal.

47:07.680 --> 47:09.000
I'd like you to cut me.

47:23.400 --> 47:25.240
I didn't. I wouldn't. I wouldn't.
No!

47:25.320 --> 47:26.800
James! Don't do it.

47:29.760 --> 47:30.760
Go, go!

47:41.520 --> 47:42.520
LUTHER: James!

48:49.080 --> 48:50.400
-James!

48:53.120 --> 48:54.440
-Oh, my God.

48:56.000 --> 48:57.800
God, he's cut his own throat.

48:58.200 --> 49:00.240
God. Jesus Christ.

49:12.120 --> 49:14.760
LUTHER: Look at me. Look at me.

49:15.640 --> 49:16.720
I'll call it in.

49:40.160 --> 49:41.640
You followed me.

49:43.960 --> 49:44.960
Yeah.

49:45.800 --> 49:48.000
And asking for my help, what was that?

49:48.520 --> 49:50.520
Manipulation

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
Yeah.

49:56.360 --> 49:59.280
You have no idea what he endured,
what was done to him.

49:59.360 --> 50:01.600
He was a good man.

50:02.400 --> 50:04.160
Pig. Filth.

50:07.080 --> 50:08.960
Take her away, please. Get a statement.

51:07.520 --> 51:08.520
Oh.

51:10.000 --> 51:11.320
Who do we have here?

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
Wow.

51:49.000 --> 51:50.680
You didn't have to cut me.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.320
Are you listening to me?
Look what you did to my arm.

51:53.400 --> 51:56.240
That is the last time
I humiliate myself for you.

51:57.320 --> 51:58.320
Okay?

51:59.000 --> 52:01.080
That is the last time you ever hurt me.

52:01.160 --> 52:02.240
James better be dead.

54:19.280 --> 54:20.400
Catherine?

54:22.280 --> 54:24.520
It's way past time you went home.

54:24.600 --> 54:27.440
Yeah. No, yeah. Sorry.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.280
Is everything all right?

54:32.000 --> 54:35.600
It's just... Something's wrong.
It's not right.

54:37.000 --> 54:39.200
Have you discussed this with DCI Luther?

54:39.280 --> 54:40.720
Well, I've tried calling him
over and over,

54:40.800 --> 54:42.200
but he's not answering, so...

54:42.800 --> 54:45.200
-Nine out of ten.

54:46.240 --> 54:47.240
Eight.

54:47.600 --> 54:49.960
No, nine. Yeah, nine.

54:50.880 --> 54:52.400
Then let's go and see him together.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.000
Okay.

55:21.600 --> 55:24.000
Luther. He knew. He must have known.

56:16.600 --> 56:17.800
All right, all right.

56:28.280 --> 56:29.280
Wotcha.
