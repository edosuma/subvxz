01:40.201 --> 01:42.468
Em, it hurts.

01:42.836 --> 01:44.903
All this dust, you've
gotta be sure to drink.

01:44.905 --> 01:47.072
Otherwise you get dried up.

02:04.791 --> 02:07.092
Is that what happened
to everyone else?

02:07.694 --> 02:08.827
What?

02:09.429 --> 02:10.963
Dry up.

02:11.397 --> 02:13.499
You know that I don't know.

02:14.067 --> 02:15.968
Well, how do you know I dry up?

02:17.036 --> 02:19.138
It's just like everything else,

02:19.140 --> 02:21.240
if it doesn't stay
wet it gets dry.

02:21.908 --> 02:23.208
That isn't good for us.

02:23.210 --> 02:25.210
We die like everything else.

02:25.212 --> 02:28.013
So, everyone else did dry up?

02:28.715 --> 02:30.516
I suppose.

02:34.187 --> 02:36.588
Where do they go
when they dry up?

02:36.590 --> 02:39.491
Ah, probably just blow away.

02:44.430 --> 02:45.697
That's it?

02:45.699 --> 02:47.166
I don't know.

02:47.767 --> 02:49.968
Quit asking me, and
help me find some food.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.522
What's wrong?

03:11.958 --> 03:14.026
Leif, are you gonna
cough up again?

03:15.595 --> 03:17.496
Well come on and
stop fooling around.

03:18.431 --> 03:20.065
Whoever lived here...

03:21.100 --> 03:22.834
They dried up.

03:28.474 --> 03:31.877
No, no, it's okay,
that's, that's just dust.

03:39.252 --> 03:40.586
See?

03:41.087 --> 03:43.255
It has just started
blowing in from outside.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.061
There's nothing to be scared of.

04:05.745 --> 04:07.179
Come on leif.

04:07.181 --> 04:09.815
We found somewhere else
that might have some food.

04:26.733 --> 04:28.166
Go for it.

05:06.339 --> 05:08.173
What does that say?

05:09.709 --> 05:11.943
Summer dress sale.

05:41.240 --> 05:43.008
What if we could fly?

05:43.010 --> 05:43.909
What?

05:43.911 --> 05:45.811
What if we could fly?

05:45.813 --> 05:47.746
We could get wherever
we're going a lot faster

05:47.748 --> 05:50.749
and get up real high and
see what's ahead of us.

05:51.317 --> 05:53.452
When was the last time
you drank something?

05:53.920 --> 05:55.654
Uhm, lunch?

05:56.923 --> 05:58.690
Drink some more.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.192
That'll do you a lot more good

06:00.194 --> 06:02.060
than wishing you could fly.

06:09.769 --> 06:11.403
Where are we going anyway?

06:11.405 --> 06:12.704
West.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.339
Just west?

06:14.341 --> 06:17.976
Yeah, I figure it's as
good a direction as any.

06:18.778 --> 06:20.946
Maybe we'll even see
some winged people.

06:20.948 --> 06:22.080
Really?

06:22.548 --> 06:23.648
No.

06:24.350 --> 06:25.851
Probably more of the same.

06:26.819 --> 06:28.286
Nothing.

06:29.489 --> 06:31.223
Maybe something.

06:31.824 --> 06:34.326
If we haven't seen anything
by now, we'll never will.

06:34.328 --> 06:36.528
So don't get your hopes up.

06:37.029 --> 06:39.264
It's more important
you focus on surviving.

06:39.966 --> 06:41.199
Okay?

06:42.769 --> 06:44.302
Yeah...

06:51.144 --> 06:53.211
Close your eyes
and get some rest.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.480
You'll need it.

06:56.115 --> 06:57.215
All right.

08:55.635 --> 08:57.402
I found this cool book.

08:58.304 --> 09:00.438
"The wonderful wizard of oz".

09:01.274 --> 09:03.241
It's been a while you
had something to read.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.377
Yeah, I've been
waiting 'till I found

09:05.379 --> 09:06.878
something that looked good.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.747
Does it have any pictures?

09:08.749 --> 09:11.550
Mostly words, a few drawings.

09:13.486 --> 09:14.819
What's an oz?

09:14.821 --> 09:16.221
Mmm.

09:16.989 --> 09:17.656
Ah!

09:17.658 --> 09:18.957
What?

09:20.259 --> 09:22.027
I think I just got stung.

09:23.296 --> 09:25.096
Let's get outta here.

09:31.504 --> 09:32.771
How bad does it hurt?

09:32.773 --> 09:35.073
Ah, it hurts but I'll live.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.474
One sting won't kill ya,

09:36.476 --> 09:38.944
but if you got swarmed
you could be a lot worse.

09:45.718 --> 09:47.786
Why don't you read it out loud?

09:50.590 --> 09:53.224
Dorothy lived in the midst
of the great Kansas prairies,

09:53.226 --> 09:54.926
with uncle Henry,
who was a farmer,

09:54.928 --> 09:57.028
and aunt em, who was
the farmer's wife.

09:57.030 --> 09:58.530
Their house was small,
for the lumber to build

09:58.532 --> 10:01.132
it had to be carried
by wagon many miles.

10:01.134 --> 10:03.668
There were four walls,
a floor and a roof,

10:03.670 --> 10:06.004
which made one room,
and this room contained

10:06.006 --> 10:09.207
a rusty looking cooking stove,
a cupboard for the dishes,

10:09.209 --> 10:12.644
a table, three or four
chairs, and the beds.

10:12.646 --> 10:15.513
Uncle Henry and aunt em had
a big bed in one corner,

10:15.515 --> 10:17.916
and Dorothy a little
bed in another corner.

10:17.918 --> 10:20.552
There was no cellar, except a
small hole dug in the ground,

10:20.554 --> 10:22.587
called a cyclone cellar,
where the family could go

10:22.589 --> 10:24.856
in case one of those
great whirlwinds arose,

10:24.858 --> 10:27.759
mighty enough to crush
any building in its path.

10:27.761 --> 10:30.095
It was reached by a trap door
in the middle of the floor,

10:30.097 --> 10:33.498
from which a ladder led down
into the small, dark hole.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.400
Today, uncle Henry
sat upon the doorstep

10:35.402 --> 10:37.469
and looked anxiously at the sky.

10:37.471 --> 10:39.804
From the far north they
heard a low wail of the wind,

10:39.806 --> 10:42.774
the long grass bowed in waves
before the coming storm.

10:42.776 --> 10:45.310
There now came a sharp whistling
in the air from the south,

10:45.312 --> 10:47.412
they turned their eyes
that way, they saw ripples

10:47.414 --> 10:49.814
in the grass coming from
that direction also.

10:49.816 --> 10:52.150
"There's a cyclone coming,
em." Called uncle Henry.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.785
"Quick, Dorothy!"
Screamed aunt em.

10:53.787 --> 10:55.253
"Run for the cellar!"

10:55.255 --> 10:56.988
When she was running
halfway across the room

10:56.990 --> 10:58.990
there came a great
shriek from the wind,

10:58.992 --> 11:00.792
and a strange thing happened.

11:00.794 --> 11:02.794
The house whirled around
two or three times

11:02.796 --> 11:04.863
and rose slowly into the air.

11:04.865 --> 11:07.565
The north and south winds
met where the house stood,

11:07.567 --> 11:10.035
and made it the exact
center of the cyclone.

11:10.037 --> 11:12.303
In the middle of a cyclone
the air is generally still,

11:12.305 --> 11:13.705
but the great pressure
of the wind on

11:13.707 --> 11:16.341
either side of the house
raised it up higher and higher,

11:16.343 --> 11:18.543
until it was at the
very top of the cyclone,

11:18.545 --> 11:18.543
and there it remained
and was carried

11:18.545 --> 11:23.548
miles and miles away as easily
as you could carry a feather.

11:24.350 --> 11:25.717
It's a place!

11:26.352 --> 11:27.085
Huh?

11:27.087 --> 11:28.486
Oz!

11:28.488 --> 11:30.388
After the cyclone, Dorothy
ended up in this place

11:30.390 --> 11:31.823
where the grass is bright green

11:31.825 --> 11:33.324
and there's color everywhere.

11:33.326 --> 11:35.827
And she was greeted by
these people called...

11:36.662 --> 11:37.629
Munchkins!

11:37.631 --> 11:39.597
And a witch, a good witch.

11:39.599 --> 11:41.299
But there are bad witches too.

11:41.301 --> 11:42.801
One was killed by
Dorothy's house,

11:42.803 --> 11:45.770
and the other, well that's
the wicked witch of the west.

11:45.772 --> 11:47.105
Witches?

11:47.107 --> 11:48.373
Yeah, there are four of them.

11:48.375 --> 11:49.774
Two good, and two bad.

11:49.776 --> 11:51.910
Anyway, Dorothy's on
this trip, like us,

11:51.912 --> 11:54.179
but she knows where she's going.

11:54.181 --> 11:55.613
Where's that?

11:55.615 --> 11:57.048
The emerald city.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.184
There's a wizard there
that'll help her get home.

11:59.186 --> 11:59.184
Are you hungry?

11:59.186 --> 12:01.720
Oh, and what's a desert?

12:01.722 --> 12:03.288
The good witch kept saying that.

12:03.290 --> 12:05.323
Ozland is surrounded by one.

12:06.158 --> 12:07.892
It's a lot worse than this.

12:07.894 --> 12:09.794
Pretty much all dirt.

12:09.796 --> 12:11.696
Have you ever seen one?

12:12.198 --> 12:14.599
When I was little, with my dad.

12:18.771 --> 12:20.538
Are ya hungry?

12:20.973 --> 12:23.074
Yeah, a little.

12:26.946 --> 12:28.880
Do we have a home?

12:29.782 --> 12:33.017
This is it, we're humming
through it every day.

12:33.519 --> 12:36.221
No, I mean a real home.

12:37.189 --> 12:40.625
Is that what we're looking
for, where we're going?

12:42.027 --> 12:43.428
We don't need a home.

12:44.130 --> 12:46.598
Just food, water, and
a means to survive.

12:48.901 --> 12:51.136
Continuing to live is
all we can hope for.

12:51.138 --> 12:52.570
We can't live forever.

12:53.405 --> 12:54.739
Then what?

12:55.407 --> 12:57.142
Then that's it.

13:00.412 --> 13:02.147
We dry up...

13:03.949 --> 13:05.216
Yeah.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.055
Hey...

13:11.891 --> 13:14.092
Quit worrying thinking
about it so much.

13:14.860 --> 13:17.796
We'll keep on surviving and
enjoy life while it lasts.

13:19.965 --> 13:21.232
Ready?

13:25.237 --> 13:27.038
Touchdown!

13:31.911 --> 13:33.511
You know who
could live forever?

13:33.513 --> 13:34.946
The scarecrow.

13:35.781 --> 13:35.780
A farmer made him out of straw,

13:35.782 --> 13:38.917
and put him on a pole in
the middle of a field,

13:38.919 --> 13:40.985
so he could scare away crows.

13:41.587 --> 13:44.055
He doesn't need to
eat, drink, or sleep.

13:44.623 --> 13:46.691
He doesn't have
any brains though,

13:46.693 --> 13:48.827
he's gonna go find the
wizard to get him some.

13:49.395 --> 13:50.795
There's no such thing
as a man who doesn't have

13:50.797 --> 13:52.530
to eat, drink or sleep.

13:52.532 --> 13:55.066
Or one that can walk
and talk with no brains.

13:55.068 --> 13:57.168
There is in Ozland.

13:57.703 --> 14:00.238
Ozland isn't real, it's
just something someone

14:00.240 --> 14:01.906
made up to entertain people.

14:01.908 --> 14:03.441
I know.

14:03.976 --> 14:06.744
But, what if?

14:14.520 --> 14:16.221
She's pretty.

14:17.923 --> 14:19.557
Thanks.

14:31.570 --> 14:33.037
You'll like this part,

14:33.039 --> 14:34.606
Dorothy and the
scarecrow found this man

14:34.608 --> 14:36.808
called the tin woodman,
he got caught out

14:36.810 --> 14:39.410
in the rain so he was all
stiff, but they found some oil

14:39.412 --> 14:42.013
and oiled up his joints so
he could move and talk again.

14:42.615 --> 14:44.249
Uhm, here!

14:44.683 --> 14:46.784
Then I made up my mind that
instead of living alone

14:46.786 --> 14:50.321
I would marry, so that I
might not become lonely.

14:50.323 --> 14:51.823
There was one of
the munchkin girls

14:51.825 --> 14:53.291
who was so beautiful that I soon

14:53.293 --> 14:55.260
grew to love her
with all my heart.

14:55.262 --> 14:57.161
But the girl lived with
an old woman who did not

14:57.163 --> 14:58.930
want her to marry anyone.

14:58.932 --> 15:00.965
So the old woman went to the
wicked witch of the east,

15:00.967 --> 15:02.901
and promised her
two sheep and a cow,

15:02.903 --> 15:04.736
if she would prevent
the marriage.

15:04.738 --> 15:07.238
Thereupon the wicked
witch enchanted my ax,

15:07.240 --> 15:09.507
and when I was chopping
away at my best one day,

15:09.509 --> 15:12.377
the ax slipped all at once
and cut off my left leg.

15:12.379 --> 15:13.645
Ouch.

15:13.647 --> 15:16.714
Yeah, every time
he swings his ax,

15:16.716 --> 15:18.516
he cuts off another
piece of his body,

15:18.518 --> 15:20.184
so he has to go to a...

15:22.021 --> 15:25.657
A tinsmith, to get a
new one made outta tin.

15:26.759 --> 15:29.294
But I little knew how
cruel my enemy could be.

15:29.296 --> 15:31.029
She thought of a new
way to kill my love for

15:31.031 --> 15:32.697
the beautiful munchkin maiden,

15:32.699 --> 15:34.365
and made my axe slip again,

15:34.367 --> 15:36.134
so that it cut right
through my body,

15:36.136 --> 15:37.969
splitting me in two halves.

15:37.971 --> 15:40.104
Once more the tinsmith
came to my help

15:40.106 --> 15:41.906
and made me a body of tin.

15:41.908 --> 15:44.275
But, alas, I had now no heart,

15:44.277 --> 15:46.911
so that I lost all my love
for the munchkin girl,

15:46.913 --> 15:49.514
I suppose she is still
living with the old woman,

15:49.516 --> 15:51.749
waiting for me to
come after her.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.219
That's sad.

15:56.255 --> 16:00.325
Yeah, but he's gonna get
a new heart from the wizard.

16:00.327 --> 16:01.326
You should get some sleep,

16:01.328 --> 16:03.261
you've had none since our break.

16:10.402 --> 16:13.304
"I shall take the heart,"
returned the tin woodman.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.606
"For brains do not
make one happy,"

16:15.608 --> 16:18.543
"and happiness is the
best thing in the world."

17:13.699 --> 17:15.433
Hey, don't go too far.

17:15.435 --> 17:16.901
I won't.

18:35.147 --> 18:39.117
Hey leif, I think
it's time we get moving.

18:53.365 --> 18:54.999
Leif?

19:00.639 --> 19:02.473
Hey leif?

19:24.997 --> 19:27.131
I got you.

19:27.133 --> 19:28.799
Where were you?

19:28.801 --> 19:31.402
You scared me, don't
ever do that again.

19:31.404 --> 19:33.838
Really, I scared you?

19:33.840 --> 19:35.573
Ah, that's great!

19:35.575 --> 19:37.074
Dorothy met a lion in the woods,

19:37.076 --> 19:38.576
he would roar to scare people,

19:38.578 --> 19:40.444
even though he was a coward.

19:40.741 --> 19:41.413
A coward?

19:41.414 --> 19:44.549
Yeah, it's somebody
who's scared of everything,

19:44.551 --> 19:47.084
so they scare other people.

19:47.086 --> 19:49.921
I heard this strange noise,
so, I got a little scared

19:49.923 --> 19:52.023
and went to go find you, but,

19:52.025 --> 19:54.125
I must've went the wrong way.

19:54.127 --> 19:57.929
And the noises got louder, so
I turned around and roared.

19:58.497 --> 20:01.499
It was only a bird
though, an owl maybe?

20:01.501 --> 20:04.802
I sure scared it, , and you.

20:05.771 --> 20:07.638
That's not funny.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.043
Emri, I'm sorry, I...

20:12.045 --> 20:13.611
it's fine.

20:14.112 --> 20:15.880
I'm just glad you're all right.

20:16.615 --> 20:17.949
Come on.

21:00.526 --> 21:01.726
Leif, let's go.

21:05.998 --> 21:07.465
Leif, are you all right?

21:08.300 --> 21:09.800
Stay right there!

21:30.022 --> 21:31.622
Hello?

21:43.035 --> 21:44.769
Are you alive?

21:46.505 --> 21:47.972
Leif?

21:48.674 --> 21:50.441
Leif are you all right?

21:58.083 --> 21:59.750
What is that?

22:03.955 --> 22:05.389
Is...

22:09.094 --> 22:11.162
Is it a tin woodman?

22:12.731 --> 22:14.832
That's just a story.

22:15.934 --> 22:17.868
Then what is it?

22:18.603 --> 22:20.338
Are you hurt?

22:26.745 --> 22:28.546
It looks like a man.

22:37.489 --> 22:40.558
Nobody got here in time to
make sure he didn't rust up.

22:54.873 --> 22:56.240
I'm sorry.

22:59.378 --> 23:01.812
It's, it's just a story leif,

23:02.814 --> 23:04.315
it's not real.

23:14.025 --> 23:15.593
I think that's the way out.

24:06.078 --> 24:07.878
You really should
be more careful.

24:08.513 --> 24:10.815
Can't be fooling around
and getting yourself hurt.

24:11.383 --> 24:13.918
We wouldn't have found
them if it hadn't happened.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.386
It was nothing.

24:16.721 --> 24:18.856
It's like when you see
a face in the clouds,

24:18.858 --> 24:20.458
or in the bark of a tree.

24:21.126 --> 24:23.194
It just looked
like a man to you.

24:24.996 --> 24:28.566
You thought it looked
like a man too, didn't you?

24:28.568 --> 24:31.235
Yeah but, I bet I wanna
find some other people

24:31.237 --> 24:33.070
just as much as you have,

24:33.839 --> 24:36.740
we both just what we
thought, looked like a man.

24:37.709 --> 24:40.911
If it was real it would've
had bones or something.

24:41.546 --> 24:43.647
Not a tin woodman.

24:43.649 --> 24:45.683
Leif, those don't exist!

24:45.685 --> 24:45.683
How do you know?

24:45.685 --> 24:48.586
Because I've never seen one!

24:48.588 --> 24:49.820
Neither one of us
even heard of one

24:49.822 --> 24:51.255
'till you started
reading that book.

24:51.257 --> 24:53.491
You're just seeing
what you wanna see.

25:20.185 --> 25:21.919
I found a map.

25:24.122 --> 25:26.790
I think there's some
bigger cities west of here.

25:28.193 --> 25:30.361
We could probably
find some supplies.

25:32.063 --> 25:34.198
Do you mind helping
me read some of this?

25:40.739 --> 25:42.673
I'm sorry about earlier.

25:57.188 --> 25:59.790
Tchk, tchk,

25:59.792 --> 26:02.459
tchk, tchk...

26:03.194 --> 26:05.729
Whoa, ah!

26:08.099 --> 26:11.435
Tchk, tchk, tchk...

26:12.304 --> 26:13.504
Ah!

26:14.139 --> 26:15.706
Dang witch!

26:16.775 --> 26:20.678
Tchk, tchk, uh, ah!

26:22.280 --> 26:25.683
Tchk, tchk, oh!

26:25.685 --> 26:26.617
Grah!

26:29.689 --> 26:31.655
The wicked witch has won!

26:31.657 --> 26:33.257
Now I'll never get
the love of that girl

26:33.259 --> 26:35.259
that I've longed for.

26:35.261 --> 26:37.494
What will I ever do?

26:38.163 --> 26:40.130
Oh, hi good sir.

26:40.132 --> 26:41.765
Scarecrow I see.

26:41.767 --> 26:44.068
Would you be so kind as to
hand me those metal legs,

26:44.070 --> 26:46.770
so I can walk again,
and those metal arms

26:46.772 --> 26:48.939
so I can be back at my best?

26:51.610 --> 26:53.978
Ah, thank you, thank you.

26:54.913 --> 26:57.147
If you could just
put the legs there

26:57.149 --> 26:59.683
and the arms here.

27:03.656 --> 27:05.522
I'm whole again!

27:05.524 --> 27:08.459
Now we can go get me a heart
so that I can find love.

27:08.461 --> 27:11.695
And for you, Mr.
Scarecrow, some brains.

27:12.197 --> 27:13.897
I already have brains.

27:14.532 --> 27:16.967
We'll get you even more brains!

27:21.206 --> 27:23.140
What does that say?

27:24.776 --> 27:26.243
Min...

27:27.145 --> 27:28.812
Minneola.

27:29.881 --> 27:31.515
What's there?

27:32.050 --> 27:34.385
I don't know, but
I think we're here.

27:35.453 --> 27:38.288
So if we keep going
west, we should find it.

27:41.092 --> 27:43.227
You should learn to read.

27:44.729 --> 27:46.230
Is it hard?

27:46.232 --> 27:49.299
It was a first,
but, it gets easier.

27:52.837 --> 27:54.772
Here, try this.

27:55.573 --> 27:57.675
Maybe some other time.

27:58.710 --> 28:01.045
Why don't you read a little
more, then go to bed?

28:03.481 --> 28:07.117
So, Dorothy, the scarecrow,
the tin woodman and the lion,

28:07.119 --> 28:08.686
are going through this
dark forest to get to

28:08.688 --> 28:11.689
the city of emeralds, and
they have to cross this river

28:11.691 --> 28:15.492
on a raft, but, the raft
gets pulled down the river.

28:16.695 --> 28:18.629
"This is bad." Said
the tin woodman,

28:18.631 --> 28:20.164
"for if we cannot
get to the land,"

28:20.166 --> 28:21.465
"we shall be carried
into the country"

28:21.467 --> 28:23.167
"of the wicked
witch of the west,"

28:23.169 --> 28:25.636
"and she will enchant
us and make us slaves."

28:25.638 --> 28:28.305
"And then I should get no
brains." Said the scarecrow.

28:28.307 --> 28:30.808
"And I should get no courage."
Said the cowardly lion.

28:30.810 --> 28:33.343
"And I should get no heart."
Said the tin woodman.

28:33.345 --> 28:36.280
"And I should never get back
to Kansas." Said Dorothy.

28:43.021 --> 28:44.688
What's your favorite color?

28:44.690 --> 28:46.657
I don't think I have one.

28:46.659 --> 28:49.693
Me neither,
munchkins like blue a lot,

28:49.695 --> 28:51.862
and everyone in the
emerald city likes green,

28:51.864 --> 28:54.431
because the whole city
is completely green.

28:55.366 --> 28:57.401
Have they made
it to see the oz yet?

28:57.403 --> 28:59.036
Not yet.

29:00.672 --> 29:04.374
What would you ask for,
if you got to meet the oz?

29:07.178 --> 29:09.046
That's tough.

29:09.048 --> 29:10.914
I'm not sure.

29:12.250 --> 29:13.917
What would you ask for?

29:17.655 --> 29:19.923
I'd ask to see my mom again.

29:22.360 --> 29:24.695
And for him to make her okay.

29:26.765 --> 29:28.966
She taught you how
to read, didn't she?

29:29.834 --> 29:33.270
Yeah, every night.

29:34.672 --> 29:37.341
She used to say that it was
something not worth losing,

29:37.343 --> 29:40.944
because we had already
lost everything else.

29:42.180 --> 29:44.848
Things were a lot different
when she was younger I guess.

29:46.618 --> 29:48.852
She never talked about it.

29:50.288 --> 29:53.524
She used to say that, when
I was older I would know.

29:55.160 --> 29:58.162
I guess she was wrong
because I'm older

29:58.164 --> 30:00.597
and I still don't know.

30:02.267 --> 30:04.635
She didn't dry up
like everyone else.

30:05.136 --> 30:08.071
She just wouldn't wake up.

30:09.541 --> 30:11.775
Then I went to go find help.

30:13.545 --> 30:16.246
But there was no
one, like always.

30:19.951 --> 30:22.119
I couldn't find
my way back home.

30:25.290 --> 30:27.558
It wasn't where
I thought it was.

30:35.400 --> 30:37.301
I know what I'd ask for.

30:38.236 --> 30:39.703
What?

30:40.538 --> 30:41.705
Comfort.

30:41.707 --> 30:42.973
Comfort?

30:42.975 --> 30:44.474
Yeah.

30:45.243 --> 30:47.611
I'd like to not have to
worry about surviving.

30:48.446 --> 30:50.414
I mean we do now, but,

30:50.416 --> 30:53.417
it'd be nice to be able to
not have to worry so much.

30:54.185 --> 30:57.287
Then we could focus
on other things.

30:59.324 --> 31:00.858
Like what?

31:02.560 --> 31:04.194
It's like...

31:04.963 --> 31:08.465
Nothing in the world matters
except this one thing,

31:08.467 --> 31:11.902
and this one thing
is all that you need.

31:12.637 --> 31:17.507
But, you can't see it,
you can't touch it.

31:18.176 --> 31:19.743
But I know that it's there,

31:19.745 --> 31:22.679
and that it exists.

31:25.183 --> 31:27.417
But I haven't found it yet.

31:30.188 --> 31:33.390
Well, I'm sure the oz can help.

31:33.392 --> 31:34.825
Yeah.

31:36.294 --> 31:39.096
I'll think of a color then.

31:42.967 --> 31:44.735
Mine's green.

31:45.470 --> 31:47.671
I just wish there
was more of it.

32:17.001 --> 32:18.769
What is that?

32:47.465 --> 32:49.333
What does that say?

32:49.901 --> 32:51.501
Ter...

32:52.136 --> 32:53.770
"Terroris".

32:54.572 --> 32:56.139
What does that mean?

32:57.008 --> 33:00.410
I think terror
is like being scared.

33:01.813 --> 33:03.914
It's someone who scares people.

33:04.649 --> 33:06.249
A scarecrow.

33:08.553 --> 33:10.354
I guess so.

33:11.456 --> 33:13.290
So scarecrows are real.

33:13.958 --> 33:16.393
And you can't say that we
aren't really seeing this.

33:16.395 --> 33:18.628
This is really something!

33:19.998 --> 33:22.132
Oh, a real scarecrow.

33:25.169 --> 33:28.138
Was a scarecrow.

33:33.978 --> 33:35.979
He was burned.

33:37.815 --> 33:39.916
Why would anyone
start a fire near him,

33:39.918 --> 33:41.518
knowing it could kill him?

33:42.053 --> 33:44.287
They may have
done it on purpose.

33:45.823 --> 33:47.257
Why?

33:49.160 --> 33:51.294
Just like that witch I guess.

33:52.096 --> 33:54.131
Some people are just evil.

33:54.133 --> 33:55.932
What do you mean?

33:57.468 --> 34:00.337
My dad always used to say that,

34:00.339 --> 34:03.206
"evil is waiting at every turn,"

34:03.208 --> 34:06.176
"and evil is what will
stop you from surviving."

34:06.178 --> 34:07.811
"You have to recognize the evil"

34:07.813 --> 34:10.847
"and find a way to overcome it."

34:12.483 --> 34:15.851
So, evil killed this scarecrow.

34:16.853 --> 34:18.155
I'd say so.

35:04.702 --> 35:06.937
How much further
'till minneola?

35:07.538 --> 35:11.541
Uh, we should be
there by tomorrow.

35:12.477 --> 35:14.077
Did you get enough to eat?

35:14.079 --> 35:16.947
Yeah, I wasn't that hungry.

35:20.319 --> 35:22.085
What was that?

35:22.954 --> 35:24.821
Sounds like wolves.

35:24.823 --> 35:26.323
Wolves?

35:27.758 --> 35:29.826
Yeah, they won't
bother us though.

35:31.062 --> 35:32.629
Are you sure?

35:33.131 --> 35:34.631
Of course.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.933
Fire will keep 'em away.

35:46.511 --> 35:48.778
I'm better at it anyway.

36:22.446 --> 36:24.381
"I am oz, the
great and terrible,"

36:24.383 --> 36:26.316
"who are you, and
why do you seek me?"

36:26.318 --> 36:28.318
"I am Dorothy, the
small and meek,."

36:28.320 --> 36:29.986
"I have come to you for help."

36:29.988 --> 36:32.022
"I am only a scarecrow,
stuffed with straw,."

36:32.024 --> 36:33.924
"I come to you praying
that you will put brains"

36:33.926 --> 36:35.458
"in my head instead of straw."

36:35.460 --> 36:37.127
"I am a woodman,
and made of tin,"

36:37.129 --> 36:39.763
"therefore I have no
heart, and cannot love."

36:39.765 --> 36:42.332
"I am a cowardly lion,
afraid of everything,."

36:42.334 --> 36:44.234
"I come to you to beg
that you give me courage,"

36:44.236 --> 36:45.769
"so that in reality I may become"

36:45.771 --> 36:48.071
"the king of beasts,
as men call me."

36:48.073 --> 36:49.839
And the voice said:
"Bring me proof that"

36:49.841 --> 36:51.942
"the wicked witch is
dead, and that moment."

36:51.944 --> 36:53.610
"I will give you your courage,"

36:53.612 --> 36:55.845
"the biggest and kindest
and most loving heart,"

36:55.847 --> 36:57.447
"such good brains
that you will be"

36:57.449 --> 36:59.683
"the wisest man in
all the land of oz,"

36:59.685 --> 37:01.484
"when you call tell
me she is dead,."

37:01.486 --> 37:04.654
"I will send you back to
Kansas, but not before."

38:25.703 --> 38:27.170
Wow!

38:28.706 --> 38:30.540
What is this place?

38:31.809 --> 38:33.410
Some kind of store I guess.

38:34.211 --> 38:35.812
What are these things?

38:53.998 --> 38:55.065
I'm okay.

38:57.135 --> 38:58.601
Don't worry em.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.804
I'm not gonna cough up.

40:44.275 --> 40:45.809
What'cha got there?

40:45.811 --> 40:48.411
I wanna go, don't you?

40:49.013 --> 40:50.079
Where is it?

40:50.081 --> 40:51.848
It's in minneola.

40:51.850 --> 40:53.750
At royal land.

40:54.418 --> 40:55.919
Can we go?

41:53.277 --> 41:55.778
Guess it's not as much
fun with no one around.

41:57.281 --> 41:59.415
What did you expect?

42:04.021 --> 42:05.889
I can imagine it.

42:08.192 --> 42:11.594
A great lion, a not
so cowardly lion,

42:11.596 --> 42:14.797
roars, and...

42:15.900 --> 42:19.102
A woman with a beard,
, like yours!

42:19.104 --> 42:23.506
Screams in terror, as the king
of the beasts stands proud.

42:25.442 --> 42:30.446
And a man, spits
fire from his mouth.

42:38.189 --> 42:39.956
And a dog...

42:41.759 --> 42:44.928
Balances a ball on his nose.

42:52.269 --> 42:56.339
And munchkins, emri look!

42:57.474 --> 43:00.109
There are munchkins,
they're real!

43:04.515 --> 43:06.482
There's so much we don't know.

43:06.951 --> 43:09.686
What if this book is the
answer, clues to what happened.

43:10.321 --> 43:13.089
Or it's just a story
based off some real things.

43:13.091 --> 43:15.258
I can see some small
people existing.

43:15.260 --> 43:18.494
Ain't nobody munchkins,
it's just small people.

43:19.496 --> 43:21.397
Walking and talking men made
out of straw and tin, witches,

43:21.399 --> 43:24.667
and all that other
stuff, it's just made up.

43:25.269 --> 43:28.171
Okay, what about
this, witch hunt?

43:28.173 --> 43:30.473
Witches have to
be real at least.

43:33.243 --> 43:34.811
I don't know.

43:40.017 --> 43:42.251
What if there's more to
this world than we know?

43:42.253 --> 43:45.254
What if Ozland really exists
and that's where everyone is?

43:45.756 --> 43:47.824
Maybe everyone there
hasn't dried up.

43:48.892 --> 43:51.394
The streets are
golden, yellow brick,

43:51.396 --> 43:53.363
and there's color and life,

43:53.365 --> 43:55.465
and all sorts of
wonderful things.

43:56.367 --> 43:58.067
And wicked witches?

43:58.669 --> 44:01.904
Maybe not, maybe
Dorothy and them kill her.

44:02.606 --> 44:04.807
I haven't gotten that far yet.

44:04.809 --> 44:07.944
And what if the wicked
witch did all this?

44:08.545 --> 44:10.413
What if she's no longer in oz?

44:11.148 --> 44:12.382
You said that evil
would do something

44:12.384 --> 44:13.816
like burn the scarecrow.

44:13.818 --> 44:15.284
Yeah, but I was just saying.

44:15.286 --> 44:18.221
But, if it is true, then
there must be a great wizard

44:18.223 --> 44:20.556
who can give us that one
thing we really want.

44:21.925 --> 44:23.226
Yeah that would
be nice but how are

44:23.228 --> 44:25.228
you gonna get to Ozland?

44:25.796 --> 44:27.363
We can find a way.

44:31.335 --> 44:33.703
Listen, imagining or
dreaming things is fine,

44:33.705 --> 44:35.605
but don't let it get in the way.

44:35.607 --> 44:37.573
You can't forget what's
really around you.

44:37.575 --> 44:39.909
Things you know are certain.

44:40.744 --> 44:42.011
I can't help it.

46:52.509 --> 46:54.577
Are we still heading west?

46:55.879 --> 46:57.980
Yeah, we've been
going west a long time.

46:58.682 --> 47:01.117
Since before you
got the bee sting?

47:02.252 --> 47:04.587
Yeah, and a while before that.

47:08.091 --> 47:10.359
I didn't tell you the
last part that I read.

47:11.628 --> 47:15.164
Dorothy and them leave the
city to go kill the witch,

47:15.166 --> 47:18.968
and they head west, and as
they get closer the witch

47:18.970 --> 47:21.337
sends animals to go kill them.

47:25.108 --> 47:27.844
The witch sent bees,
and not just bees,

47:27.846 --> 47:30.546
she sent wolves
and she sent crows.

47:30.548 --> 47:32.248
The other night we were
surrounded by wolves

47:32.250 --> 47:34.450
and the fire must've
protected us.

47:35.986 --> 47:37.954
Now there are these crows.

47:44.094 --> 47:46.162
Leif, crows can't kill you.

47:46.930 --> 47:48.464
And that bee just stung me,

47:48.466 --> 47:51.467
and those wolves, they could've
killed us if they wanted to.

47:52.903 --> 47:54.136
I just made up the
part about the fire

47:54.138 --> 47:55.905
to make you feel better.

47:59.009 --> 48:01.010
You mean we
could've been eaten?

48:05.148 --> 48:07.383
Nah, they wouldn't
wanna eat us.

48:21.098 --> 48:22.965
Let's get moving.

48:25.736 --> 48:27.103
No.

48:32.309 --> 48:35.578
If Ozland is real, then
the witch must be too.

48:36.647 --> 48:38.948
I think she's the reason
everything is all dried up.

48:38.950 --> 48:41.317
She's the evil
that did all this.

48:45.255 --> 48:47.657
In the book did Dorothy
and them kill the witch?

48:49.332 --> 48:50.127
Yeah, but...

48:50.128 --> 48:53.062
and didn't Dorothy
kill the only other one,

48:53.064 --> 48:55.231
so there shouldn't be any left?

48:55.233 --> 48:57.033
But we don't
know that for sure.

48:57.035 --> 48:59.969
Exactly, we don't know
any of this for sure.

48:59.971 --> 49:01.671
So let's go.

49:05.409 --> 49:07.310
There could be another witch!

49:07.312 --> 49:09.412
One like the wicked
witch of the west.

49:09.414 --> 49:11.814
And she's sending these
things as we get closer.

49:11.816 --> 49:14.350
The only thing she hasn't
sent is flying monkeys.

49:17.621 --> 49:19.388
You're joking.

49:19.856 --> 49:22.258
Leif there's no such
thing and you know it.

49:22.759 --> 49:24.393
I don't know it.

49:24.828 --> 49:26.929
I didn't know that
munchkins exist.

49:26.931 --> 49:28.831
Or scarecrow, or tinman.

49:28.833 --> 49:31.000
So why can't there
be flying monkeys?

49:31.002 --> 49:32.635
Those will kill us.

49:36.440 --> 49:38.140
I'm outta water.

49:38.709 --> 49:40.810
And you don't have
much left either.

49:41.278 --> 49:44.513
We'll die of thirst long
before some monkey kills us.

49:44.515 --> 49:46.882
Now grab your stuff and lets go.

50:09.606 --> 50:11.540
Can you check and see if
you can find some bottles?

50:11.542 --> 50:12.908
It's getting really hot.

50:12.910 --> 50:14.877
We're gonna need to
carry more water.

50:16.380 --> 50:17.646
Yeah.

51:10.934 --> 51:12.501
Did you find anything?

51:12.503 --> 51:14.537
I just found one.

51:16.006 --> 51:20.543
Yeah, okay,
guess that'll have to work.

51:25.248 --> 51:26.582
I'll do it.

51:29.886 --> 51:31.520
You sure?

51:36.259 --> 51:37.660
Yeah.

51:38.662 --> 51:40.129
Okay.

51:40.530 --> 51:42.131
Guess I'll take a break.

51:43.266 --> 51:44.667
Thanks.

53:15.425 --> 53:16.759
Y'all filled up?

53:16.761 --> 53:18.227
Yeah.

53:25.101 --> 53:27.636
And uh, here's the extra.

53:27.638 --> 53:29.104
Do you have room to carry it?

53:29.106 --> 53:31.273
Yeah, I can take it.

53:43.486 --> 53:45.521
Have they made it
to see the oz yet?

53:45.523 --> 53:47.256
I haven't read that part.

53:48.458 --> 53:51.026
I'm not that tired, do
you wanna read some of it?

53:51.928 --> 53:53.862
Not tonight.

54:53.923 --> 54:55.190
Emri?

54:59.496 --> 55:00.829
Emri?!

55:40.603 --> 55:41.570
Emri!!

55:41.572 --> 55:44.440
Leif, are you all right?

55:45.041 --> 55:47.176
Whatever it was, it
was just a dream.

55:48.345 --> 55:50.145
The witch sent it.

55:50.714 --> 55:52.981
No problems, it
was just a dream.

55:53.750 --> 55:55.551
It flew right at me.

56:00.156 --> 56:01.890
But you're okay now.

56:14.871 --> 56:16.905
Is it because we're going west?

56:17.974 --> 56:20.075
Do we have to go that way?

56:21.544 --> 56:23.445
I don't guess so.

56:23.947 --> 56:26.382
Thought it was a good idea
for whatever reason but...

56:27.384 --> 56:29.485
I don't want it to be like this.

56:31.121 --> 56:33.055
So, if going in another
direction will fix that,

56:33.057 --> 56:35.624
then that's what I want.

56:36.126 --> 56:37.259
Really?

56:38.161 --> 56:39.561
Of course.

56:41.531 --> 56:43.165
You're all I got.

56:43.666 --> 56:45.534
And I'm all you got.

56:46.403 --> 56:48.404
We won't survive any other way.

56:49.606 --> 56:51.140
We'll go another way.

56:54.043 --> 56:56.378
Maybe you'll find that
thing you were looking for.

57:42.192 --> 57:43.859
You know what that says?

57:44.561 --> 57:46.762
"Home is where the heart is".

57:47.163 --> 57:49.031
If that were true, the
tin woodman shouldn't

57:49.033 --> 57:51.500
have had such a hard
time trying to find his.

57:52.669 --> 57:54.703
I think it means
something different,

57:54.705 --> 57:57.239
home is like a place of comfort.

57:59.309 --> 58:01.343
Did you and your
dad have a home?

58:01.911 --> 58:04.313
Yeah we had a
little place in the woods.

58:06.382 --> 58:08.083
Do you remember where it is?

58:08.651 --> 58:11.653
Nah, I survived behind

58:11.655 --> 58:13.822
but it seemed like the
animals got fewer and fewer

58:13.824 --> 58:15.691
until I had to leave.

58:16.759 --> 58:19.228
I couldn't remember where
it was now if I wanted.

58:22.565 --> 58:24.666
Do you ever wanna go back home?

58:26.369 --> 58:28.303
You mean the one
I had with my dad?

58:29.539 --> 58:31.039
Yeah.

58:33.343 --> 58:35.644
With him gone it
wouldn't be a home.

58:38.181 --> 58:40.415
Maybe you need
to find a new home.

58:43.119 --> 58:45.220
That would be nice.

58:49.025 --> 58:51.226
I wish I could meet the oz.

58:52.462 --> 58:54.530
So I can go back home.

58:56.099 --> 58:58.500
And see my mother again.

59:01.971 --> 59:04.339
Maybe you can ask for a home.

59:05.575 --> 59:08.377
And that other thing you wanted.

59:10.713 --> 59:12.514
Maybe so.

59:21.925 --> 59:23.425
It's so hot.

59:24.594 --> 59:26.261
Drink something.

59:27.363 --> 59:29.364
I think I need a break, em.

59:30.533 --> 59:32.568
Yeah, I could use one too.

59:45.748 --> 59:47.549
Have you ever seen an oasis?

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:25.974
Emri.

01:02:27.610 --> 01:02:29.311
Emri wake up.

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:32.080
What?

01:02:46.662 --> 01:02:47.929
Hey!

01:02:49.198 --> 01:02:50.265
Hey!

01:03:01.611 --> 01:03:04.079
Help, help, help, help!

01:03:05.782 --> 01:03:06.748
Hi!

01:03:07.817 --> 01:03:10.285
I'm leif, this is Emry.

01:03:14.724 --> 01:03:16.758
I can't believe you're real.

01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:19.194
A real life tinman!

01:03:27.737 --> 01:03:29.304
What's your name?

01:03:32.476 --> 01:03:34.543
Ain't nothing of your concern.

01:03:34.545 --> 01:03:38.180
Loi, my name is loi.

01:03:40.049 --> 01:03:41.416
Hi loi!

01:03:41.751 --> 01:03:42.784
Where are you going?

01:03:42.786 --> 01:03:44.886
Help, find help.

01:03:46.155 --> 01:03:47.556
For what?

01:03:48.424 --> 01:03:49.724
Where'd you come from?

01:03:49.726 --> 01:03:52.994
Home, it is my
primary function.

01:03:53.629 --> 01:03:55.797
Home, where's that?

01:03:57.466 --> 01:03:59.067
Gone.

01:04:02.004 --> 01:04:05.140
Do you know Dorothy, the
scarecrow, the cowardly...

01:04:05.142 --> 01:04:08.844
eddy, Andy and
Abby, help, find help.

01:04:10.646 --> 01:04:12.247
What happened?

01:04:12.648 --> 01:04:16.685
Emergency personnel needed
at 615 Ace colonial Avenue.

01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:19.087
What happened?

01:04:19.089 --> 01:04:22.090
Bright flash, fire
immediately followed.

01:04:25.261 --> 01:04:26.928
The witch did it?

01:04:30.132 --> 01:04:31.333
Witch?

01:04:31.901 --> 01:04:33.134
Witch.

01:04:35.538 --> 01:04:36.972
Which way?

01:04:37.473 --> 01:04:38.807
Yeah, witch.

01:04:39.275 --> 01:04:40.709
That way!

01:04:41.110 --> 01:04:42.110
West?

01:04:42.112 --> 01:04:43.378
Yes.

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:45.280
Help this way.

01:04:48.718 --> 01:04:50.285
The witch did it.

01:04:57.126 --> 01:04:58.793
Can you help?

01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:04.399
I'm sorry, I...

01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:08.770
Loi wait.

01:05:09.338 --> 01:05:10.839
Please wait, loi!

01:05:10.841 --> 01:05:13.842
Do not interfere!

01:05:14.277 --> 01:05:15.610
Loi wait!

01:05:15.612 --> 01:05:16.544
Wait loi!

01:05:16.546 --> 01:05:18.146
Do not interfere!

01:05:40.503 --> 01:05:42.304
I'm sorry, I had to do it.

01:05:46.742 --> 01:05:48.043
I know.

01:05:49.512 --> 01:05:51.613
I didn't want him to hurt me.

01:05:52.281 --> 01:05:54.849
I'd never let him
or anything else hurt you.

01:06:01.691 --> 01:06:03.491
What should we do with him?

01:06:08.731 --> 01:06:11.866
My dad did his best
to help me survive.

01:06:13.035 --> 01:06:15.737
He teached me to
able to help myself.

01:06:17.373 --> 01:06:19.774
Then one day he got real sick.

01:06:23.145 --> 01:06:25.413
A lot like your mom I guess.

01:06:27.416 --> 01:06:29.551
There was nothing I
could do to help him.

01:06:29.553 --> 01:06:31.186
He knew it.

01:06:33.856 --> 01:06:35.757
We didn't know of
anyone else so he said

01:06:35.759 --> 01:06:39.794
for that reason, I had
to make sure I survived.

01:06:40.696 --> 01:06:42.764
Even though he couldn't.

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:47.602
Day before he passed,

01:06:48.637 --> 01:06:50.939
he made me promise to bury him.

01:06:51.841 --> 01:06:55.844
He said it was something
people used to do.

01:06:59.448 --> 01:07:01.549
So the next day,

01:07:02.551 --> 01:07:04.619
I found him with no breath

01:07:05.588 --> 01:07:08.556
and no more beat
left in his heart,

01:07:10.593 --> 01:07:13.161
and I put him in a
hole in the ground,

01:07:13.163 --> 01:07:15.363
and covered it with dirt.

01:07:20.770 --> 01:07:23.038
I guess we should
do the same for him.

01:07:27.076 --> 01:07:28.510
Yeah.

01:07:30.746 --> 01:07:32.614
I think we should.

01:08:51.393 --> 01:08:53.595
Leif, leif?

01:08:57.666 --> 01:08:58.966
It's so hot.

01:08:58.969 --> 01:09:00.335
Have you been drinking?

01:09:00.903 --> 01:09:02.002
Yeah.

01:09:02.005 --> 01:09:03.671
Let me see.

01:09:06.175 --> 01:09:08.408
Leif why haven't you been
drinking more than this?

01:09:10.679 --> 01:09:12.479
We don't have a lot left.

01:09:14.049 --> 01:09:16.384
I didn't wanna use it all up.

01:09:17.486 --> 01:09:18.653
Drink the rest of this,

01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:20.421
we have the extra
bottle remember?

01:09:21.357 --> 01:09:23.424
We can refill yours later.

01:09:32.201 --> 01:09:33.600
Feeling better?

01:09:33.603 --> 01:09:36.203
Yeah, I am.

01:09:38.506 --> 01:09:40.707
Drink when you get thirsty.

01:09:40.710 --> 01:09:41.776
I know we don't have a lot,

01:09:41.778 --> 01:09:45.078
but, I promise we'll find more.

01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:58.092
Hi...

01:10:02.231 --> 01:10:03.898
Did you hear that?

01:10:32.194 --> 01:10:34.963
I'm coming in
just a minute, I promise.

01:10:34.965 --> 01:10:37.765
I always have about
three or four...

01:10:40.169 --> 01:10:43.071
Hi, this is Dee.

01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:49.110
I've left this message in the
hope that it reaches someone.

01:10:49.112 --> 01:10:52.046
I know there has to be
more of us out there.

01:10:54.183 --> 01:10:57.051
My friends and I have
a camp, east of here,

01:10:57.053 --> 01:10:58.786
about 10 miles.

01:10:59.655 --> 01:11:03.458
We have water,
food, and shelter.

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:06.628
There are four of
us, including myself,

01:11:06.630 --> 01:11:09.764
but, we would happily feed more.

01:11:09.766 --> 01:11:11.866
If you get this
message, head east

01:11:11.868 --> 01:11:14.002
and look for the brick building.

01:11:14.004 --> 01:11:16.604
There's a red x in the window.

01:11:16.606 --> 01:11:18.806
We hope to see you.

01:11:27.283 --> 01:11:29.083
Can you believe it?

01:11:29.818 --> 01:11:31.252
I can.

01:11:32.054 --> 01:11:33.688
There's someone else,

01:11:34.757 --> 01:11:36.891
and she sounds so beautiful.

01:11:41.597 --> 01:11:42.964
Dee.

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:46.401
I can't wait to meet her.

01:11:48.037 --> 01:11:50.071
So, we are going?

01:11:50.073 --> 01:11:52.006
Of course!

01:11:53.509 --> 01:11:56.644
The tinman was
right, we found help!

01:11:58.347 --> 01:12:00.214
Am I imagining this?

01:12:02.051 --> 01:12:03.618
Not at all.

01:12:06.722 --> 01:12:08.856
What if she really is Dorothy?

01:12:10.426 --> 01:12:12.560
You know what, she could be!

01:12:12.578 --> 01:12:13.128
Really?

01:12:13.129 --> 01:12:16.764
Yeah, I, I couldn't explain loi

01:12:16.766 --> 01:12:18.466
and I never thought
this would happen,

01:12:18.468 --> 01:12:20.768
so, why not?

01:12:21.403 --> 01:12:23.504
Maybe you'll get to
meet your Dorothy.

01:12:26.743 --> 01:12:28.776
If you get
this message, head east

01:12:28.778 --> 01:12:30.845
and look for the brick building.

01:12:30.847 --> 01:12:33.514
There's a red x in the window.

01:12:33.516 --> 01:12:35.450
We hope to see you.

01:12:40.622 --> 01:12:42.256
How do I look?

01:12:44.326 --> 01:12:45.560
What?

01:12:46.195 --> 01:12:47.729
Do I look good?

01:12:48.130 --> 01:12:49.831
You look the
same as you always do.

01:12:50.566 --> 01:12:52.166
Is that good?

01:12:53.235 --> 01:12:54.869
I guess so.

01:12:58.907 --> 01:12:59.907
Have you gotten
far enough to know

01:12:59.909 --> 01:13:01.175
if they got their wishes?

01:13:01.177 --> 01:13:02.610
Not yet.

01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:09.917
Would you show me
how to read some of it?

01:13:10.303 --> 01:13:10.853
Really?

01:13:10.854 --> 01:13:13.921
Yeah, I'd like to be able to.

01:13:19.928 --> 01:13:22.764
Let's start with something
you've heard before,

01:13:22.766 --> 01:13:24.632
it should make it easier.

01:13:25.334 --> 01:13:26.701
What's this word?

01:13:29.138 --> 01:13:31.639
Do, dor...

01:13:31.641 --> 01:13:33.074
Dorothy!

01:13:33.076 --> 01:13:35.910
Lived in the midst of
the great Kansas prairies,

01:13:35.912 --> 01:13:38.112
with un...

01:13:38.114 --> 01:13:39.147
Unc...

01:13:39.149 --> 01:13:40.014
Uncle.

01:13:40.016 --> 01:13:40.014
Uncle.

01:13:40.016 --> 01:13:43.818
Henry, who was
a farmer, and aunt...

01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:45.186
Em!

01:13:45.188 --> 01:13:47.088
That was an easy one.

01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:48.956
Who was the farmer's wife.

01:13:48.958 --> 01:13:52.560
Their house was sma...

01:13:53.061 --> 01:13:53.995
Small...

01:13:53.997 --> 01:13:55.296
Small.

01:13:56.098 --> 01:13:59.066
There were four
walls, a floor, a roof,

01:13:59.068 --> 01:14:01.702
which made one room,
and this room contained

01:14:01.704 --> 01:14:05.473
a rusty looking cooking stove,
a cupboard for the dishes,

01:14:05.475 --> 01:14:08.843
a table, three or four
chairs, and the beds.

01:14:08.845 --> 01:14:11.913
Uncle Henry and aunt em had
a big bed in one corner,

01:14:11.915 --> 01:14:14.248
and Dorothy a little
bed in another corner.

01:14:14.250 --> 01:14:17.418
There was no garret
at all, and no cellar,

01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:19.854
except a small hole
dug in the ground,

01:14:19.856 --> 01:14:22.223
called a cyclone cellar,
where the family could go

01:14:22.225 --> 01:14:24.659
in case one of those
great whirlwinds arose,

01:14:24.661 --> 01:14:27.395
mighty enough to crush
any building in its path.

01:14:30.934 --> 01:14:32.700
Will be there tomorrow?

01:14:34.069 --> 01:14:37.638
We should, I don't
think it's too much further.

01:14:39.374 --> 01:14:41.509
What do you think
she'll look like?

01:14:44.446 --> 01:14:46.214
I don't know.

01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:48.916
Maybe red hair?

01:14:50.285 --> 01:14:53.588
My mom had red
hair, she was tall.

01:14:55.724 --> 01:14:57.658
Maybe Dee will be tall too.

01:14:58.794 --> 01:15:02.897
Tall, short, red hair,
brown hair, either way.

01:15:03.699 --> 01:15:06.234
Tomorrow we're gonna find
what we've been looking for.

01:15:10.239 --> 01:15:11.205
I know we hadn't realized it

01:15:11.207 --> 01:15:13.207
but this is what we both wanted.

01:15:14.409 --> 01:15:16.777
I guess we have your
book to thank for that.

01:15:18.847 --> 01:15:20.348
Are you feeling better?

01:15:20.716 --> 01:15:23.784
Yeah, I feel good.

01:15:24.786 --> 01:15:25.786
Good.

01:15:26.321 --> 01:15:27.922
Drink up.

01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:29.991
We fill up tomorrow and...

01:15:30.959 --> 01:15:33.394
Maybe we won't have to
worry about that anymore.

01:15:39.568 --> 01:15:41.102
Red.

01:15:43.171 --> 01:15:45.172
Red's my favorite color.

01:15:47.009 --> 01:15:48.843
And I wish there was more of it.

01:15:49.444 --> 01:15:51.479
Maybe there soon will be.

01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:53.614
More red and green.

01:17:08.423 --> 01:17:12.326
Dee, are you here?

01:17:16.064 --> 01:17:17.465
Dee?

01:17:41.857 --> 01:17:43.157
Hello?

01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:58.039
Em, come here!

01:18:19.161 --> 01:18:21.996
Em, did they try...

01:18:21.998 --> 01:18:23.898
they're dead.

01:18:27.235 --> 01:18:29.070
There are three graves.

01:18:29.571 --> 01:18:32.406
One of them might still
be alive, maybe it's Dee.

01:18:33.041 --> 01:18:34.408
With three dead there
wouldn't be anyone

01:18:34.410 --> 01:18:35.843
to bury the fourth.

01:18:37.479 --> 01:18:39.046
She's gone.

01:19:03.772 --> 01:19:06.340
Hi, this is Dee.

01:19:06.342 --> 01:19:07.908
I've left this message...

01:20:28.156 --> 01:20:29.924
How are you?

01:20:29.926 --> 01:20:31.258
I'm okay.

01:20:32.627 --> 01:20:34.361
Just disappointed.

01:20:35.197 --> 01:20:36.630
Yeah.

01:20:43.038 --> 01:20:44.638
What now?

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:47.875
We forget about
this and move on.

01:20:49.945 --> 01:20:52.213
We were fine before all this.

01:20:52.215 --> 01:20:53.647
I shouldn't have let
myself get excited

01:20:53.649 --> 01:20:55.683
and lead us all out
here for nothing.

01:20:56.251 --> 01:20:57.651
We couldn't have known.

01:20:57.653 --> 01:20:59.420
We both thought
we could find her.

01:20:59.422 --> 01:21:03.157
It was a distraction,
one after another.

01:21:03.159 --> 01:21:05.526
It's not helping us survive.

01:21:05.528 --> 01:21:07.461
If anything, it's hurting us.

01:21:07.463 --> 01:21:08.796
We're surviving okay.

01:21:08.798 --> 01:21:11.899
For now, but we're
almost outta water.

01:21:11.901 --> 01:21:14.735
I didn't see any
in there, did you?

01:21:15.604 --> 01:21:17.204
No.

01:21:18.373 --> 01:21:21.375
We got our hopes up and now
we're gonna pay the price.

01:21:24.079 --> 01:21:27.548
Em, I'm sorry, I know
how much it meant to you...

01:21:27.550 --> 01:21:29.817
just forget about it.

01:21:31.753 --> 01:21:33.787
Now get up and let's go.

01:21:34.222 --> 01:21:35.890
Where are we going?

01:21:36.458 --> 01:21:38.592
Somewhere other than here.

01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:27.401
I need to take a break.

01:23:40.582 --> 01:23:42.549
We have to find something soon.

01:23:42.551 --> 01:23:44.685
Are there any creeks nearby?

01:23:55.997 --> 01:23:57.865
I don't know where we are.

01:23:59.467 --> 01:24:01.135
I let myself lose track.

01:24:13.515 --> 01:24:14.815
Leif!

01:24:15.283 --> 01:24:16.583
Why didn't you tell
me you had these?

01:24:16.585 --> 01:24:17.751
I can explain.

01:24:17.753 --> 01:24:18.919
Were you just gonna let us die?

01:24:18.921 --> 01:24:20.654
Why would you lie about this?

01:24:20.656 --> 01:24:21.855
I was saving it.

01:24:21.857 --> 01:24:23.223
For what?

01:24:23.992 --> 01:24:25.359
The witch.

01:24:26.694 --> 01:24:29.329
Dorothy and them used
water to kill the witch.

01:24:29.331 --> 01:24:31.432
You said yourself that
evil is what would stop us

01:24:31.434 --> 01:24:33.634
from surviving, so
I recognized that,

01:24:33.636 --> 01:24:35.836
and I was doing what I
needed to do to stop it.

01:24:35.838 --> 01:24:37.504
You're an idiot.

01:24:37.506 --> 01:24:37.504
You lied about the bottles

01:24:37.506 --> 01:24:40.240
so how do I know you're
not lying about this.

01:24:40.242 --> 01:24:41.975
I can't read.

01:24:41.977 --> 01:24:44.344
For all I know you're
making all of this up.

01:24:44.346 --> 01:24:46.513
The witch isn't real!

01:24:46.515 --> 01:24:48.115
What is real, is you're
letting your stupid brain

01:24:48.117 --> 01:24:50.150
come up with all this crap.

01:24:51.219 --> 01:24:52.419
If there is some evil
that's gonna keep us

01:24:52.421 --> 01:24:54.855
from surviving, it's you.

01:24:55.857 --> 01:24:57.891
Em, I'm so sorry, I...

01:24:57.893 --> 01:25:00.627
give it up, I have
had enough of this.

01:25:00.629 --> 01:25:02.496
Dreaming and thinking
"what if" is fine,

01:25:02.498 --> 01:25:04.164
but you're gonna
kill us over it!

01:25:04.166 --> 01:25:05.499
No, I'm not!

01:25:05.501 --> 01:25:07.167
We're not gonna
talk about the witch,

01:25:07.169 --> 01:25:09.503
Dorothy, oz, or any of
that nonsense anymore,

01:25:09.505 --> 01:25:11.138
do you hear me?

01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:13.607
You said yourself that
there's something out there

01:25:13.609 --> 01:25:15.776
that you can't explain,
you can't touch it,

01:25:15.778 --> 01:25:18.245
you can't see it, but
you know it exists.

01:25:20.148 --> 01:25:22.182
That's what Ozland is for me.

01:28:02.677 --> 01:28:03.977
Why?!

01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:06.747
What?

01:28:06.749 --> 01:28:08.315
Why did you this?

01:28:08.317 --> 01:28:10.317
I did it for our own good.

01:28:10.319 --> 01:28:11.785
How am I supposed to
know if the oz gave them...

01:28:11.787 --> 01:28:14.521
I said we're not gonna
talk about this anymore.

01:28:15.623 --> 01:28:17.724
Just be glad I didn't
burn the whole book.

01:28:30.506 --> 01:28:32.406
Leif, stop it!

01:28:34.842 --> 01:28:35.609
Leif!

01:28:43.985 --> 01:28:45.585
Stop, stop it!

01:28:45.987 --> 01:28:47.054
Quit!

01:28:48.323 --> 01:28:49.556
Calm!

01:28:51.292 --> 01:28:53.193
Leif, calm.

01:30:30.057 --> 01:30:31.825
I shouldn't have done that.

01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:35.395
I know how much the
story means to you.

01:30:37.999 --> 01:30:40.467
Do you think the oz gave
them what they asked for?

01:30:41.035 --> 01:30:42.502
Of course.

01:30:43.638 --> 01:30:45.539
Do you really think that?

01:30:47.575 --> 01:30:49.810
They killed the witch
and did what the oz asked,

01:30:50.478 --> 01:30:52.212
he had to keep his promise.

01:30:54.115 --> 01:30:55.715
I hope so.

01:31:26.547 --> 01:31:29.449
Hi, this is Dee.

01:31:30.985 --> 01:31:34.688
I've left this message in the
hope that it reaches someone.

01:31:34.690 --> 01:31:37.257
I know there has to be
more of us out there.

01:31:37.259 --> 01:31:39.759
My friends and I have...

01:32:30.378 --> 01:32:32.279
I wanna go home.

01:32:39.287 --> 01:32:40.754
I hope you get there.

01:33:51.058 --> 01:33:52.859
It's just like Dorothy's.

01:33:56.397 --> 01:33:58.331
Yeah, I guess it is.

01:34:43.577 --> 01:34:44.844
Emri.

01:34:47.348 --> 01:34:49.616
There's a cyclone coming in.

01:35:05.099 --> 01:35:06.633
A cyclone?

01:35:06.635 --> 01:35:07.967
It is.

01:35:10.204 --> 01:35:11.838
They're real.

01:35:16.477 --> 01:35:18.278
We should get somewhere safe.

01:35:18.846 --> 01:35:21.147
There's a door to the
cellar underneath the rug.

01:35:38.232 --> 01:35:39.933
Come on leif, get in!

01:35:41.435 --> 01:35:44.037
Leif I know it's amazing but
you need to get down here!

01:35:45.673 --> 01:35:47.107
This is my chance.

01:35:47.541 --> 01:35:49.142
Come on, don't be crazy.

01:35:50.211 --> 01:35:53.246
No, I have to.

01:35:53.248 --> 01:35:54.647
Leif come on!

01:35:54.649 --> 01:35:58.251
No, I'll be fine, you go.

01:36:00.154 --> 01:36:02.155
You don't know if it'll work.

01:36:02.890 --> 01:36:04.290
You'll die.

01:36:04.792 --> 01:36:06.493
No, I won't.

01:36:08.796 --> 01:36:12.132
Leif, please.

01:36:13.334 --> 01:36:15.635
If I don't do this now,

01:36:15.637 --> 01:36:17.804
I may never get home.

01:36:28.482 --> 01:36:30.250
I'm going to Ozland.

01:40:09.269 --> 01:40:10.703
Leif?

01:40:16.677 --> 01:40:17.977
Leif?

01:40:22.149 --> 01:40:23.416
Leif?!

01:40:30.425 --> 01:40:32.025
Leif?!

01:40:33.394 --> 01:40:34.794

01:40:38.499 --> 01:40:39.866
Leif!
