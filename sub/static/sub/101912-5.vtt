WEBVTT

00:13.535 --> 00:15.450
[Bazza]
You should do me one favor.

00:15.580 --> 00:19.845
Don't give up. You'll get
to America in the end.

00:19.976 --> 00:20.716
[Alfred] Let's get down
to business, shall we?

00:20.846 --> 00:23.023
I'm getting to America.

00:23.153 --> 00:25.590
If you've got something that
could make that happen, I'm in.

00:25.721 --> 00:27.462
I might just have something.

00:27.592 --> 00:29.855
We've made
no fucking progress at all!

00:29.986 --> 00:32.641
If London falls, the northern
cities will surrender.

00:32.771 --> 00:35.557
Full-scale artillery
bombardment will do the trick.

00:35.687 --> 00:38.516
League council are electing
a new prime minister.

00:38.647 --> 00:40.301
As you may have heard,
the last one killed himself.

00:40.431 --> 00:43.304
This good woman is
the rightful queen of England,

00:43.434 --> 00:46.655
and we are the rightful
government of England.

00:46.785 --> 00:48.526
I have no gift for politics,

00:48.657 --> 00:50.876
but this new chap Aziz
might listen to reason.

00:51.007 --> 00:52.704
It had occurred to me.

00:52.835 --> 00:54.576
[Peggy]
Where the hell have you been?

00:54.706 --> 00:55.751
[Sykes] Round and about.

00:55.881 --> 00:57.448
This is me friend Katie.

00:57.579 --> 00:58.841
I've told her nowt
about me past,

00:58.971 --> 01:00.712
and you'll do likewise, eh?

01:00.843 --> 01:03.498
-Are you trying to seduce me?
-I guess I am.

01:03.628 --> 01:06.283
I've never been seduced by
a crypto-fascist bastard before.

01:06.414 --> 01:07.806
[Melanie] I'm going home.

01:07.937 --> 01:08.851
No. You leave
when I say you can leave.

01:08.981 --> 01:10.200
Fuck you.

01:12.115 --> 01:14.509
I'm Gully Troy,
and you don't cross me.

01:14.639 --> 01:16.293
I'm Alfred Pennyworth,
and I just did.

01:16.424 --> 01:19.079
Thank you for helping me.

01:21.646 --> 01:24.388
Ancillary technical staff.
Dr. Lucius Fox.

01:24.519 --> 01:25.694
[Salt] Ladies and gentlemen,
you're about to see

01:25.824 --> 01:28.523
a demonstration of Stormcloud.

01:28.653 --> 01:30.264
This is the future
of chemical warfare.

01:32.309 --> 01:36.705
[Harwood] This is victory,
ladies and gentlemen. Victory.

01:47.411 --> 01:48.456
[door closes]

01:48.586 --> 01:50.284
[crowd screaming in distance]

01:50.414 --> 01:53.243
[panting]

01:55.419 --> 01:56.594
Get out of my way!

01:59.510 --> 02:00.642
Fuck.

02:00.772 --> 02:02.252
Get out of my way!

02:04.428 --> 02:06.474
Die, you evil bastard!

02:06.604 --> 02:08.737
[yelling]

02:10.391 --> 02:11.696
No! Stop!

02:11.827 --> 02:14.525
[gunshot]

02:14.656 --> 02:17.528
You once told me you could
get me on a plane to America.

02:17.659 --> 02:21.663
Well, times have changed.
Everyone and his dog wants out.

02:21.793 --> 02:23.012
Well, the embassy
still operates

02:23.143 --> 02:24.753
a regular flight out
once a week,

02:24.883 --> 02:28.148
but there are hundreds
on the waiting list.

02:28.278 --> 02:31.020
I need three seats
on next week's flight to Gotham.

02:31.151 --> 02:34.763
Seats are like gold dust.
Air crews are on the take.

02:34.893 --> 02:36.330
Customs are on the take.
Immigration--

02:36.460 --> 02:37.940
I didn't think
we'd fly for free.

02:38.070 --> 02:39.289
How much?

02:41.900 --> 02:43.424
Well, five grand a head?

02:43.554 --> 02:45.817
Fuck.

02:45.948 --> 02:47.906
-I thought half that, tops.
-Mm.

02:48.037 --> 02:49.908
That's a conservative estimate.

02:50.039 --> 02:53.608
-You can't make that?
-Not at this exact moment, no.

02:55.523 --> 02:57.873
Well, maybe I could help.

02:58.003 --> 02:59.570
How?

02:59.701 --> 03:01.181
I could loan you the money
you need.

03:01.311 --> 03:04.401
Oh. That's very kind of you.
No, thanks.

03:04.532 --> 03:06.621
-It's no bother at all.
-No.

03:06.751 --> 03:08.144
Why not?

03:08.275 --> 03:10.320
I'd rather not be in debt
to the CIA.

03:10.451 --> 03:11.365
I know where that leads.

03:13.062 --> 03:15.847
-No strings. Between friends.
-[chuckles]

03:17.458 --> 03:19.329
We are friends, aren't we?

03:19.460 --> 03:21.723
You can call it that.

03:21.853 --> 03:23.507
Thanks all the same.

03:23.638 --> 03:26.597
I'll get your money for you.
No problem.

03:31.602 --> 03:35.867
[Thomas]
File 457NFH. Contact log 35.

03:35.998 --> 03:38.087
Alfred Pennyworth.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.611
Subject made contact seeking
assistance regarding travel to

03:40.742 --> 03:44.049
and residence in America.

03:44.180 --> 03:47.531
Subject is a recruitment target
of long standing.

03:49.751 --> 03:51.709
Good morning, sleepyhead.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.494
Morning.

03:57.149 --> 03:58.977
[chuckles]

04:06.202 --> 04:07.595
-Oh, my God.
-I know.

04:07.725 --> 04:09.292
-Oh.
-What did I do wrong?

04:10.554 --> 04:12.774
Of course you don't know
how to make coffee.

04:12.904 --> 04:15.037
-You have people for that.
-I do.

04:15.167 --> 04:17.605
And I'll bring them along
next time.

04:17.735 --> 04:20.129
I really have to get going.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.783
What are you doing today?

04:23.611 --> 04:26.440
Just, um, routine sentry duty.

04:27.876 --> 04:29.007
You've been pretty busy

04:29.138 --> 04:31.749
-with the League lately.
-I guess.

04:31.880 --> 04:34.404
You're not putting yourself
in too much danger, I hope.

04:34.535 --> 04:35.405
Are you?

04:38.321 --> 04:40.932
Is it my imagination or are you
pumping me for information?

04:41.063 --> 04:43.500
No. No, certainly not.

04:43.631 --> 04:45.894
I worry about you, that's all.

04:46.024 --> 04:48.113
-You don't worry about me?
-No.

04:48.244 --> 04:51.856
I assume you can take care
of yourself, like I can.

04:51.987 --> 04:53.249
Well, I figure when you're
in a relationship,

04:53.380 --> 04:55.730
people, they-they
look out for each other.

04:55.860 --> 04:57.079
This is what,
the third time we've had sex?

04:57.209 --> 04:59.995
-Fourth.
-Okay, fourth.

05:00.125 --> 05:03.477
That's not a relationship.
That's sex four times.

05:03.607 --> 05:06.131
It's a sex thing.

05:06.262 --> 05:08.133
And you're actually
pretty good for a rich guy.

05:08.264 --> 05:11.093
Oh, gee, thanks.

05:11.223 --> 05:13.051
Well, if this,
if this "sex thing" is

05:13.182 --> 05:14.618
ever gonna
turn into a relationship,

05:14.749 --> 05:15.880
then we'll-we'll need
to be spending

05:16.011 --> 05:17.012
a certain amount
of time together.

05:17.142 --> 05:20.581
Okay. Well, I really have to go.

05:20.711 --> 05:23.018
Uh, like, for instance,
right now.

05:23.148 --> 05:25.629
Can't League business
wait a couple of hours?

05:25.760 --> 05:27.936
No. It's important.

05:28.066 --> 05:30.068
Sentry duty? Really?

05:30.199 --> 05:31.592
You're trying to make me mad.

05:31.722 --> 05:33.028
You are pumping me
for information.

05:33.158 --> 05:35.900
C-I-fucking-A to the bone.

05:36.031 --> 05:37.946
I give up.

05:38.076 --> 05:39.469
Well, you can't just go
through life pretending

05:39.600 --> 05:41.645
you like being alone.

05:41.776 --> 05:43.343
Now, I know it's very,
very fashionable and modern.

05:43.473 --> 05:45.214
I-I'm not pretending.
I'm not pretending.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.650
But, Jesus, would an--
would an actual relationship

05:46.781 --> 05:48.652
be that bad?

05:48.783 --> 05:50.741
I mean, let's be honest,
most women would,

05:50.872 --> 05:52.743
-they would...
-[laughs softly]

05:52.874 --> 05:54.832
[stammers]

05:54.963 --> 05:56.617
Oh, no, please continue.

05:56.747 --> 05:58.314
Go on.

05:58.445 --> 06:01.230
Tell me what, um,
most women would do.

06:01.361 --> 06:04.755
Most women wouldn't try so hard
to get themselves killed.

06:04.886 --> 06:06.844
It's like you want to get hurt.

06:06.975 --> 06:10.631
It's like somewhere deep inside,
you hate yourself.

06:13.285 --> 06:15.287
It's true.

06:15.418 --> 06:17.855
I don't love myself quite
as much as you love yourself,

06:17.986 --> 06:20.292
but, um, that's kind
of healthy, I think.

06:20.423 --> 06:23.905
Learn to hate yourself a little
bit more, be good for your soul.

06:24.035 --> 06:26.690
See how you work. When you make
someone else feel bad

06:26.821 --> 06:28.170
about themselves,
you feel good about yourself.

06:28.300 --> 06:29.258
You're a self-esteem vampire.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.173
Maybe you should leave now.

06:31.303 --> 06:32.827
Okay, I...

06:32.957 --> 06:34.219
I take that back.
That was unfair.

06:34.350 --> 06:36.265
Wh-- Unfair
because it's not true

06:36.396 --> 06:37.527
or unfair because it's true?

06:37.658 --> 06:39.660
I misspoke.

06:41.923 --> 06:43.794
You're not Dracula. But you...

06:46.057 --> 06:48.233
...you do have some tendencies.

06:48.364 --> 06:49.931
You know what? Fuck you.

06:50.061 --> 06:51.933
I rest my case.

06:57.329 --> 06:58.940
Ugh.

06:59.070 --> 07:00.028
Clean your goddamn apartment.

07:00.158 --> 07:01.725
-[scoffs]
-Slob.

07:04.293 --> 07:05.903
-[door closes]
-[scoffs]

07:09.080 --> 07:13.476
I've thought about you often
since we met so strangely.

07:13.607 --> 07:17.045
-How are you faring?
-Well enough, ma'am. And you?

07:17.175 --> 07:19.787
Oh, one god-awful ghastly thing
after another.

07:19.917 --> 07:21.136
I'm sorry to hear that.

07:21.266 --> 07:23.965
Keep out of politics, my dear.

07:24.095 --> 07:26.097
Where on earth
are you taking me?

07:30.841 --> 07:32.713
[clears throat, laughs softly]

07:50.382 --> 07:51.993
Welcome.

07:52.123 --> 07:53.777
A pleasure to meet you,
Dr. Gaunt.

07:53.908 --> 07:55.475
Prime Minister.

07:55.605 --> 07:57.259
Martha, thank you so much
for arranging this.

07:57.389 --> 07:59.087
-You are a treasure.
-Isn't she?

07:59.217 --> 08:01.437
The minute I met her,
I knew she was special.

08:01.568 --> 08:03.134
Uh, well,
I'll leave you guys to it.

08:03.265 --> 08:04.832
And we have guards
surrounding the place,

08:04.962 --> 08:07.008
so you won't be disturbed.

08:08.400 --> 08:09.619
Please.

08:10.881 --> 08:12.927
Odd venue.

08:13.057 --> 08:15.712
It was one
of my favorite restaurants.

08:15.843 --> 08:18.759
Exquisite cassoulet. Mmm.

08:18.889 --> 08:20.412
Alas.

08:20.543 --> 08:23.111
I was surprised to hear
from you.

08:25.113 --> 08:27.898
I wanted to open channels
of communication--

08:28.029 --> 08:30.161
-discreet channels.
-Why now?

08:30.292 --> 08:32.207
I've wanted to speak
to the League for some time,

08:32.337 --> 08:35.906
but Archbishop Potter
was an amiable zealot.

08:36.037 --> 08:38.648
I hear that you're
a reasonable man.

08:38.779 --> 08:40.520
I've heard the same of you.

08:40.650 --> 08:42.522
Well, let's reason
with each other, shall we?

08:42.652 --> 08:44.175
Well, I'd love to do that,
but I'm afraid

08:44.306 --> 08:47.744
Lord Harwood and I are
old acquaintances.

08:47.875 --> 08:49.137
A good man in many respects

08:49.267 --> 08:51.356
but not near
as reasonable as we are.

08:51.487 --> 08:53.184
Great leaders are often
more passionate

08:53.315 --> 08:54.708
than they are reasonable,
don't you find?

08:54.838 --> 08:56.536
[both chuckle]

08:56.666 --> 08:58.450
I'm happy to talk
in either case, but do you speak

08:58.581 --> 09:00.148
for Harwood and the Union
or for yourself?

09:00.278 --> 09:02.454
I speak for the good
of the English people.

09:02.585 --> 09:05.806
Ah. How can I refuse
such virtue?

09:05.936 --> 09:09.026
If you were to agree,
a cease-fire,

09:09.157 --> 09:11.942
a negotiated surrender
on honorable terms,

09:12.073 --> 09:13.335
what would those terms be?

09:13.465 --> 09:15.598
Surrender.

09:15.729 --> 09:17.426
-I hadn't considered the notion.
-Of course you have.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.907
Have the Army, the Navy,
the Air Force solidly behind us.

09:20.037 --> 09:21.561
London is surrounded.

09:21.691 --> 09:22.997
You have, what,
five percent of the country?

09:23.127 --> 09:24.564
Geographically.

09:24.694 --> 09:28.480
Psychologically,
I'd say we were still ahead.

09:28.611 --> 09:32.876
You've conquered cities,
not souls.

09:33.007 --> 09:34.486
I don't think you understand
the seriousness

09:34.617 --> 09:37.315
of the situation,
Prime Minister.

09:37.446 --> 09:39.491
We haven't even used
our most effective weapons yet.

09:39.622 --> 09:41.842
We've been showing
great restraint.

09:41.972 --> 09:44.192
Oh, yes, your secret weapon.

09:45.323 --> 09:47.238
Stormcloud, is it?

09:47.369 --> 09:49.545
-What is that, exactly?
-You tell me.

09:49.676 --> 09:51.155
No, no, no.
We know all about it.

09:51.286 --> 09:52.504
I was just curious
to know if you know.

09:52.635 --> 09:55.246
Perhaps Harwood
compartmentalizes

09:55.377 --> 09:56.508
such sensitive matters.

09:56.639 --> 09:59.076
You know nothing
about Stormcloud.

09:59.207 --> 10:01.731
If you did,
you'd be happy to surrender.

10:03.080 --> 10:05.169
-[panting]
-So tell me.

10:05.300 --> 10:08.172
God help you if Stormcloud
is ever deployed.

10:08.303 --> 10:10.392
God help all of us.

10:10.522 --> 10:13.221
Dear me.
Old Testament stuff, eh?

10:13.351 --> 10:16.354
Yes.

10:16.485 --> 10:19.836
I wish I could tell you more.

10:19.967 --> 10:21.577
Your message in summary--

10:21.708 --> 10:24.101
we should surrender
to vague terroristic threats.

10:24.232 --> 10:26.843
You should come to terms
with reality, Prime Minister.

10:26.974 --> 10:29.629
The League holds London.

10:29.759 --> 10:31.369
You daren't destroy
the city to pry us loose.

10:31.500 --> 10:34.285
The world's opinion
would not forgive you.

10:34.416 --> 10:36.853
While we hold London,
I am the prime minister

10:36.984 --> 10:38.942
of Her Rightful Majesty's
government.

10:39.073 --> 10:41.945
We are England.

10:42.076 --> 10:44.469
